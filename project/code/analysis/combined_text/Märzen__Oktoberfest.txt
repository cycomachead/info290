a
really
good
american
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
a
thin
uncarbonated
body
that
flows
down
with
ease
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
remind
you
that
this
brew
was
meant
to
chug
outdoors
at
a
beer
garden
basic
in
most
ways
and
yet
true
to
the
style
toffee
sweet
malty
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
styles
of
the
year
copper
pour
yields
a
small
clingy
head
bready
and
malty
nose
give
way
to
toffee
and
more
malty
flavor
smooth
and
easy
finish
this
is
a
great
marzen
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
light
some
bready
malts
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malts
some
breadiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
very
sad
for
them
not
only
was
it
sticky
sweet
and
syrupy
but
it
was
also
lagered
poorly
and
almost
no
hop
plus
that
apricot
syrup
flavor
this
seems
like
ab
had
a
hand
in
this
beer
not
very
good
not
bad
but
not
a
great
oktoberfest
offering
distinctive
but
not
captivating
o
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
nice
aroma
and
flavor
that
doesnt
go
overboard
but
isnt
bland
like
some
other
renditions
body
and
carbonation
go
really
well
together
not
much
to
complain
about
could
use
some
of
the
depth
of
the
flavor
in
the
aroma

solid
drinkable
and
toasted
malt
are
the
signature
notes
here
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
aromas
of
rich
bready
maltiness
flavor
follows
the
same
basic
formula
but
adds
some
melanoid
and
light
dried
fruits
pretty
good
take
on
a
marzen
from
a
stateside
brewery
a
better
than
average
but
not
extraordinary
märzen
has
some
sweetness
to
it
that
i
was
not
expecting
balances
well
the
hops
overall
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
possibly
my
most
favorite
very
complex
and
satisfying
a
must
try
overall
i
liked
this
beer
its
a
tasty
oktoberfest
i
was
excited
to
try

and
eyes
widen
as
i
reach
for
a
bottle
in
a
mix
sixpack

pop
that
top
and
pour
a
clear
orange
colored
beer
with
a
thin
5
finger
head
that
did
not
last
very
little
smell
but
i
have
a
bit
of
a
cold
so
it
may
be
better
than
i
can
tell
at
the
moment
cherries
sweet
malt
disappointed
in
the
taste
some
caramel
and
spices
on
the
front
and
what
tastes
like
cherry
with
a
hint
of
soap
on
the
finish
that
finish
lingers
in
the
back
of

with
an
abv
of

this
brew
pours
out
a
light
brown
color
with
a
off
white
head
this
brew
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
the
smell
is
rich
grains
and
malts
there
is
also
some
sweetness
in
this
brew
i
like
the
smell
of
this
brew
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
so
far
the
taste
is
rich
with
grains
and
malts
you
pick
up
on
the
sweetness
in
this
brew
there
is
also
caramel
flavor
in
this
brew
oktoberfest
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
for
having
a
high
abv
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bad
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
rich
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
4

out
of

i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
a
4
is
given
to
oktoberfest
goose
island
beer
co
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
probably
pick
it
up
again
overall
a
solid
representation
of
an
american
marzen
would
seek
out
again
in
seasons
to
follow
o
a
solid
american
ofest
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
earthy
notes
a
bit
more
akin
to
a
double
bock
with
the
level
of
maltiness
but
still
a
good
fall
brew
copper
color
some
caramel
and
nutty
flavor
notes
however
the
body
was
thinner
than
i
like
for
this
style
overall
one
of
the
better
american
ones
ive
had
to
be
honest
a
little
sweeter
than
some
and
less
burnt
malts
but
i
did
it
id
still
go
with
the
german
options
if
available
but
a
good
beer
notes
bottled

pours
a
clear
brown
amber
with
a
medium
off

aroma
and
taste
of
toasted
grains
malt
and
some

notes
a
medium

with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
has
some
light
caramel
and
mild
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
overall
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
still
a
refreshing
brew
overall
way
too
sweet
to
be
a
good
example
of
a
marzen
overall
this
is
a
good
american
oktoberfest
beer
it
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
confidently
can
say
i
like
it
better
than
the
sam
adams
oktoberfest
that
beer
had
a
bigger
fruity
note
than
the
goose
island
version
this
is
a
good
one
to
drink
this
fall
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
german
marzen
good
toasty
malt
notes
with
some
nice
subtle
fruit
notes
drinks
easy
enough
but
nothing
special

5
overall

a
great
take
on
the
oktoberfest
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
thus
far
id
say
its
a
safe
bet
to
buy
a
six
pack
if
you
havent
tried
it
its
highly
unlikely
youll
hate
it
youll
probably
either
love
it
or
think
its
pretty
okay
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
an
american
version
of
a
marzen
it
took
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
you
would
find
in
a
traditional
example
of
the
style
and
they
amplified
them
which
ended
up
working
well
and
i
think
the
bolder
flavors
suit
the
american
palate
a
little
more
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
fairly
clean
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
especially
on
a
nice
fall
night
sitting
by
the
bonfire
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
had
it
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
they
were
just
bolder
than
normal
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
just
a
little
too
high
for
the
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
bolder
oktoberfest
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
or
mild
malty
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
came
into
this
beers
expecting
a
bolder
version
of
a
traditional
marzen
and
thats
exactly
what
i
got
its
not
my
favorite
beer
from
goose
island
but
its
up
there
was
on
the
better
american
marzens
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
beer
embodies
the
spirit
of
a
german
oktoberfest
with
a
bold
american
twist
i
enjoyed
it
keep
up
the
solid
work
pours
hazy
and
orange
with
a
fat
creamy
head
of
off
white
foam
that
last
well
and
leaves
lace
has
some
yellow
hues
nose
is
subtle
and
not
too
breaddy
but
has
plenty
of
caramel
and
sweetness
on
it
smells
a
bit
floral
and
sugary
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
caramel
not
really
deeply
breaddy
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
slick
on
the
palate
a
little
grass
brings
this
one
home
pretty
sweet
and
with
a
substantial
bitterness
form
hops
breaddiness
starts
to
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
with
a
little
bread
crust
that
ups
my
opinion
of
it
considerably
overall
this
is
just
what
i
expect
for
the
style
the
subtle
hops
presence
is
done
really
well
and
blends
and
balances
with
the
malts
very
well
this
brew
is
a
beautiful
amber
copper
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
of
hops
toastiness
and
bread
the
flavor
is
clean
with
a
malt
dominate
flavor
and
a
firm
bitterness
fairly
full
in
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
very
good
overall
pretty
accurately
nails
down
what
a
märzen
is
supposed
to
be
as
far
as
im
concerned
toasty
dark
copper
color
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
extremely
drinkable
or
at
least
mine
went
down
pretty
fast
85
b
it
has
a
nice
mild
malty
taste
hops
are
under
stated
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
a
clean
sweetness
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
drink
for
the
after
rebate
price
of
under
five
bucks
a
six
i
may
buy
more
it
should
keep
well
just
tried
for
the
first
time
tonight
pretty
good
pours
a
dark
orangehazel
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
toasty
aromas
and
some
sweetness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
full
of
semi
sweet
flavors
like
vanilla
and
caramel
giving
although
the
finish
is
very
mellow
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
also
a
nice
consistency
for
the
style
very
much
improved
over
the
one
i
had
last
year
while
its
not
as
good
as
the
now
retired
gi
harvest
ale
this
is
a
nice
oktoberfest
that
i
could
drink
all
night
if
i
were
so
inclined
i
would
buy
it
again
this
years
label
2014
is
blue
and
white
which
are
the
traditional
colors
of
oktoberfest
another
great
pseudocascade
following
a
mighty
pour
it
drives
theoldlady
nuts
when
i
do
it
but
i
like
the
head
formation
the
release
of
esters
and
the
visual
aspect
of
it
i
got
just
over
a
finger
of
foamy
tawny
head
that
quickly
fell
to
wisps
i
usually
do
not
get
hung
on
clarity
one
way
or
the
other
but
this
had
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
see
through
the
walls
into
the
neighbors
house
i
could
see
into
the
future
i
could
see
france
i
could
see
your
underpants
i
am
going
to
describe
the
magnificent
color
as
somewhere
between
deep
amberlight
copper

six
pack
of
this

by
no

is
that
an
insult
in

the
opposite

pure

fits
the

theres
just

bend
to
this
where
id
definitely
drink
it
again
and
maybe
even
buy
it
again
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
by
the
sixpack
even
o
this
beer
is
a
little
unique
compared
to
oktoberfests
given
the
apricot
aromas
and
flavors
but
it
seems
a
little
easier
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
it
isnt
as
malty
o
cloyingly
sweet
but
nice
flavor

overall
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
helped
it
out
also
overall
a

marzen
would
get
again

not
cloying
crisp
and
refreshing
o
i
am
glad
goose

came
back
with
this
beer
i
had
nothing
against
their
harvest
but
this
oktoberfest
by
them
shouldnt
have
gone
away
i
would
definitely
drink

bad
id
prefer
others
first
though
so
pleased
to
see
brewed
in
chicago
il

purchased
was

rather
airy

to
some
of
the
more
robust

crushing
waves
of
interplay
bread

caramel
hints
of
bright

fruit
with
a
nutty
signature
americanized
o
fest
tone
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
here
a
bit
of
minimal
earthiness
with
some
herbal
characters
come
through
with
a
very
calm
bitterness
barely
detectable
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
yet
equally
unimpressive
and
standout
in
this
style
i
would
say
if
i
had
ten
of
this
seasons
oktoberfests
that
this
version
is
ranking
6th
or
7th
in
my
minds
ideal
version
of
the
style
having
said
the
word
bready
a
lot
i
think
that
really
describes
the
beer
its
a
solid
beer
that
i
enjoy
and
is
highly
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
3
or
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
which
is
a
negative
for
a
style
i
want
to
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
when
i
drink
still
great
and
underrated
though
overall
lacking
notes
of
caramel
and
it
feels
watery
at
times
everything
seems
muted
d
an
exceptional
american
interruption
of
the
marzen
oktoberfest
style
rock
solid
appearance
and
aroma
the
flavor
is
solid
but
lags
the
other
facets
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
the
end
result
is
a
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
offering
that
will
be
amongst
my
regular
indulgences
for
the
style
you
cant
imagine
how
embarrassed
i
felt
when
asking
someone
at
my
local
store
if
this
stuff
had
come
out
the
year
before
or
not
oh
well
anyway
this
stuff
pours

topped
by
a

the

toast
a

brings
in
more
of

with
the

the

wow
and
then
some
i
may
have
found
my
new
ofest
beer
overall
impression
just
when
i
thought
id
have
my
last
oktoberfest
i
see
one
that
catches
my
eye
very
awesome
for
the
style
too
very
easy
drinking
but
then
has
quite
a
bit
of
ingredient
for
one
of
the
goose
island
main
stream
line
up
brews
enjoyed
tons
and
look
forward
to
again
the
menu
has
this
listed
at
5
9
abv
not
my
thing
a
smooth
malty
fall
beer
wo
hops
solid
for
style
though
check
it
out
if
you
dig
the
smooth
very
highly
recommended
the
pour
was
nice
enough
with
a
medium
amber
colored
body
and
nice
carbonation
in
and
around
the
glass
a
nice
head
of
white
that
was
maybe
an
inch
high
came
up
over
the
top
and
settled
down
quickly
into
a
nice
tight
little
layer
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
malts
and
hints
of
sour
fruits
which
served
as
a
night
little
break
from
the
norm
rich
flavor
here
lots
of
bread
hints
of
fruit
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
to
lighten
it
up
different
and
more
complex
then
i
would
have
thought
smooth
easy
drinking
and
super
sessionable
i
had
no
issue
at
all
with
putting
this
one
down
very
quickly
a
solid
beer
i
would
look
for
again
nice
malty
aroma
color
is
copper
quite
usual
for
an
oktoberfest
taste
is
also
about
what
id
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
nice
malty
sweet
almost
caramel
front
with
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
offering
from
goose
island
d
this
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
seems
much
more
complex
than
the
old
discontinued
12oz
bottled
version
of
this
i
was
never
terribly
excited
to
drink
the
old
version
but
this
batch
seems
so
much
different
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
easygoing
unfiltered
marzen
with
a
fresh
profile
and
a
rich
and
flavorful
quality
that
is
what
makes
the
style
so
great
happy
oktoberfest
cheers
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
sharp
hoppy
nose
dark
bronze
pour
with
a
nice
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
mouthfeel
is
crisp
yet
not
full
enough
to
reflect
the
abundant
aroma
and
powerful
flavor
goose
island
once
again
finds
a
wonderful
blend
of
sweet
creamy
malts
and
complimentary
hops
in
this
brew
a
nice
all
around
quality
here
fine
example
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
this
beer
has
a
amber
tint
to
it
the
smell
was
great
high
notes
of
carmel
and
a
nice
sized
head
made
this
a
quick
favorite
of
mine
this
is
the
first
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
i
would
def
try
others
ultimately
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
ofest
for
starters
this
is
not
an
oktoberfest
its
a
very
american
amber
in
my
opinion
not
a
bad
beer
but
stil
not
an
ofest
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
grains
and
then
moves
into
a
rich
roasted
caramel
flavor
it
this
roasted
flavor
thats
uncharacteristic
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
going
to
hoist
some
steins
a
better
than
average
oktoberfest
but
only
about
an
average
effort
for
a
goose
island
not
a
bad
beer
here
just
that
there
are
much
better
oktobers
out
there
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
its
appearance
nice
fluffy
head
and
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
little
hoppy
kickback
at
the
end
a
little
too
light
in
the
body
some
caramel
and
burnt
nut
tastes
going
on
overall
a
pretty
decent
oktober
id
never
refuse
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
either
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
very
deep
copperred
into
my
mug
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
thin
skim
but
with
a
patchy
lasting
lace
i
must
say
the
color
of
this
brew
is
truly
something
to
marvel
at
incredible
dark
copperred
with
extreme
brilliance
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
moderatehigh
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
spicy
toasted
grains
very
little
hop
aroma
is
detected
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
wonderful
the
sweet
malt
is
moderatehigh
in
perception
with
a
little
spicyness
and
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
initially
sweet
brew
leaves
my
mouth
fairly
dry
and
wanting
more
the
carbonation
is
moderate
with
a
medium
body
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
oktoberfest
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
consistency
of
every
category
the
appearance
and
taste
were
truly
great
the
sweetness
is
balanced
enough
by
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
perhaps
its
best
quality
next
year
this
wont
be
a
single
definitely
a
full
6er
or
more
i
havent
had
their
oktoberfest
from
years
past
but
2006s
was
a
darn
good
effort
a
really
good
american
oktoberfest
for
sure
this
is
also
a
good
beer
to
give
your
friend
who
is
an
american
macro
drinker
to
get
him
to
understand
that
theres
more
than
one
king
of
beer
out
there
i
think
theyd
be
surprised
with
the
flavor
definitly
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfest
beers
tried
for
the
first
time
this
past
fall
and
was
very
delighted
it
poured
a
great
dark
burnt
sienna
shade
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
was
malty
and
pleasant
this
is
truly
one
of
the
better
americanmade
octoberfest
beers
out
there
atleast
that
my
taste
buds
have
had
the
privilege
of
discovering
full
of
roasted
caramel
malts
with
easy
smooth
drinking
no
funky
aftertaste
clean
and
tasty
truly
superb
d
an
uncomplicated
beer
good
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
this
must
be
a
very
popular
festivalsession

enjoyable
drinkable
american
version
of
the
oktoberfest
style

year
for
sure
i
have
beckje01
to
thank
for
it
drinkability
easy
to
drink
an
above
average
example
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
slight
head
the
carbonation
is
moderate
along
with
the
clarity
it
has
a
rosasty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
carmel
it
goes
down
smooth
and
hop
character
is
a
little
strong
in
the
aftertaste
i
also
noticed
a
smoky
taste
to
it
the
ingredients
and
pretty
well
balanced
and
the
flavor
is
well
pronounced
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
i
ve
had
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
dense
off
white
head
forms
goes
pretty
quick
but
laces
well
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
caramel
and
a
little
smoke
bread
and
citrus
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
as
well
smoky
little
bit
of
chocolate
bread
caramel
citrus
delicate
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
get
my
buzz
onn
my
description
above
doesnt
really
do
this
beer
any
justice
it
was
quite
good
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
and
sampling
others
in
the
category
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
good
body
with
sturdy
carbonation
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
good
deal
of
this
brew
i
recall
not
enjoying
this
one
as
much
last
year
but
i
find
myself
really
liking
the
brew
in
front
of
me
right
now
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
have
access
to
it
summarizing
this
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
retread
with
german
hops
substituted
for
the
english
and
a
german
lager
yeast
and
cool
fermentation
for
an
english
ale
yeast
and
treatment
while
still
a
quite
pleasant
beer
it
is
on
the
very
fringes
of
the
okto
style
and
a
little
extra
effort
would
produce
a
beer
that
is
truer
to
the
style
and
not
as
compromised
ambertoffee
in
color
off
white
kind
of
lingers
as
broken
apart
film
and
ring
sweet
grainy
apple
juice
like
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
quite
grainy
at
first
but
more
flavors
reveal
themselves
as
some
caramely
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
some
raisins
and
plums
some
hop
flavor
kind
of
adds
to
the
dry
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
good
american
oktoberfest
on
the
sweet
side
certainly
drinkable
but
goose
island
has
better
beers
so
i
was
a
bit
diappointed
with
this
one
goose
island
makes
some
nice
ales
but
this
attempt
at
the
famous
munich
fest
beer
missed
the
mark
goose
islands
okotberfest
is
very
reminiscent
of
killians
red
this
just
another
forgettable
amber
lager
it
has
a
pleasant
brownish
red
tint
with
a
slight
head
and
little
lacing
like
most
oktoberfest
beers
it
smells
a
bit
spiced
with
an
earthy
pumpkin
like
hint
it
tastes
jus
like
it
smells
and
is
rather
smooth
and
full
tasting
a
medium
bodied
beer
i
could
drink
a
couple
at
an
oktoberfest
event
but
not
year
round
drinkability
this
is
good
not
great
sessionable
a
wonderful
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
malty
sweetness
with
slight
scent
of
hoppiness
a
light
and
malty
taste
with
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
a
watery
mouth
feel
but
still
very
drinkable
it
stays
close
to
the
flavor
one
would
expect
from
a
marzen
which
makes
this
fairly
good
beer
overall
the
most
flavorful
oktoberfest
ive
had
so
far
goose
island
oktoberfest
was
orangebrown
in
color
and
clear
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
starts
out
fine
but
is
soon
reduced
to
only
a
thin
layer
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
also
mostly
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
it
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
its
a
very
easy
drinking
seasonal
im
looking
forward
to
another
good
beer
dark
copper
with
golden
edges
small
slightly
fizzy
light
khaki
head
caramel
roll
dough
and
spicy
gingerbread
light
vegetal
hop
notes
tangy
vegetal
bitterness
up

before
malt
takes
over
sweetish
cookie
dough
and
caramel
toasted
bitterness
into
the
finish
with
lingering
sweetbread
malt
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
not
bad
a
decent
octoberfest
brew
nothing
to
blow
you
away
but
still
a
solid
well
crafted
brew
great
session
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
lexington
surprised
that
i
had
never
drank
this
beer
before
the
beer
stands
true
to
most
german
oktoberfests
looks
brightly
amber
with
active
carbonation
thought
the
head
retention
is
fleeting
a
constant
lacing
forms
amber
malts
emit
a
rich
but
light
caramel
malt
bready
and
grain
aromas
these
go
right
into
the
flavor
initial
flavorful
amber
malt
caramel
light
toffee
nuttiness
bready
yeasty
flavors
later
flavors
of
oversparged
grain
begin
to
rear
under
the
lightening
body
though
clean
textured
and
flavored
the
graininess
becomes
a
bid
distracting
but
expected
for
the
style
alcohols
and
earthy
hops
decorate
the
finish
conclusively
a
solid
brew
and
will
visit
it
again
aroma
is
very
caramel
tinged
and
quite
toasty
color
is
a
hazy
muddy
amber
darker
than
usual
for
the
style
mostly
headless
flavor
is
smoothe
sweet
malts
caramel
with
notes
of
honey
and
fruity
sweetness
very
low
hop
profile
as
per
the
style
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
pretty
decent
beer
perfect
pour
into
a
pint
glass
starts
with
perfect
two
finger
head
but
quickly
dissipates
to
a
constant
film
of
foam
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
nice
hop
nose
with
a
taste
to
back
it
up
slight
malt
sweetness
adds
an
air
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
but
overall
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
at
all
i
think
this
kind
of
beer
is
more
condusive
to
drinking
in
mass
quantities
than
constant
slow
sips
and
savoring
every
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
regular
lets
drink
a
beer
beer
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
toasted
nutty
aroma
i
cant
decide
if
i
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
beer
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
delicious
toasted
malt
flavor
complemented
by
spicy
hops
on
the
other
hand
i
also
taste
sweet
iced
tea
which
is
really
out
of
place
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
light
but
still
decent
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
notable
flaws
12
ouncer
sampled
a
treat
to
see
more
goose
island
selections
being
available
in
the
nyc
area
bottle
provides
best
when
consumed
by
dating
and
also
lets
the
consumer
know
this
should
be
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
nice
stuff
going
on
here
beer
education
and
information
is
a
good
thing
this
one
pours
a
healthy
dark
almond
mahogony
shade
of
tastyness
minor
tan
head
and
just
the
usual
sort
of
lacing
nose
is
the
expected
bready
malty
ofest
odor
i
found
this
brew
to
be
very
pleasantly
malty
smooth
and
long
lasting
on
the
tongue
and
gums
notes
of
vanilla
honey
and
nutty
maltyness
would
make
a
fine
sessioner
very
rich
and
pleasant
brew
i
havent
tried
anything
from
goose
island
that
was
not
spot
on
this
is
the
last
bottle
of
a
six
pack
i
bought
several
weeks
ago
i
think
that
over
that
time
its
mellowed
out
slightly
more
malt
flavors
have
come
through
and
the
taste
has
been
better
balanced
not
sure
if
its
been
aging
in
my
fridge
or
if
im
becoming
used
to
some
of
the
more
problematic
tastes
or
what
im
scoring
according
to
my
tasting
of
the
whole
six
pack
but
i
wanted
to
include
this
information
in
the
review
to
give
a
more
complete
picture
of
the
beer
super
smooth
with
a
little
hop
zing
up
front
calm
light
munich
malts
overall
a
slightly
above
average
yet
very
typical
ofest
poured
a
very
standard
clear
malt
brown
in
color
smell
was
dominated
by
the
mild
roasted
malt
profile
taste
is
pretty
much
all
malt
with
a
very
mild
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
but
a
little
thin
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
spicy
hop
and
toasted
malt
aroma
flavors
not
as
strong
in
caramel
as
from
bottles
according
to
the
brewers
grains
are
american
2row
bonlander
munich
and
black
malts
that
being
said
the
medium
body
and
round
mouthfeel
combine
with
the
lightly
roasted
character
and
balanced
floral
hop
flavors
to
give
a
nice
finish
still
have
some
taste
reservations
from
the
malt
tastes
certainly
worth
a
try
on
tap
i
dont
think
its
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
but
were
another
put
in
front
of
me
id
take
it
gladly
like
stated
prior
goose
island
does
things
very
well
but
weakly
this
has
the
makings
of
a
very
very
good
oktoberfest
if
it
had
a
bit
more
spine
try
for
yourself
and
see
what
i
mean
found
it
on
tap
at
old
chicago
and
gave
it
a
shot
it
poured
a
very
dark
copper
with
a
white
head
that
is
a
bit
sticky
it
smelled
like
aromatic
hops
and
had
a
very
nice
malt
aroma
aswell
it
tasted
very
good
it
was
sweet
and
tasted
like
malt
sweetness
with
a
little
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
overall
it
was
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
easily
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
theres
a
good
amount
of
visible
carbonation
i
liked
how
it
smelled
malty
with
some
notes
of
spice
present
quite
interesting
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
really
exceptional
a
good
amount
of
maltiness
with
hints
of
spices
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
as
well
very
creamy
and
easy
to
swallow
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
while
eating
german
food
its
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
but
its
still
quite
good
ffrom
the
bottle
poured
a
copper
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
aroma
malt
vinegar
sour
as
it
warms
caramel
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
fruity
flavor
mild
malts
and
bitter
hops
anice
clean
mouthfeel
not
to
bad
of
a
bier
d
this
is
a
very
average
beer
i
understand
that
it
is
meant
to
be
consumed
a
liter
at
a
time
for
many
hours
but
it
doesnt
have
any
real
complexity
or
interest
perhaps
paired
with
spicy
mustard
and
pretzels
it
will
be
more
interesting
draught
clybourn
brewpub
this
one
pours
a
clear
rich
coppery
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
on
it
its
aroma
was
pleasant
but
a
hair
weak
some
nice
spices
and
maltiness
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
full
than
the
nose
a
decent
malt
body
with
some
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
nice
darker
than
most
oktoberfests
goose
islands
version
of
the
style
is
a
reddishbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
provides
good
lacing
smells
musty
and
malty
pretty
boring
but
really
stands
out
with
its
taste
which
finishes
with
a
delicious
hoppiness
and
toastedness
if
the
base
flavor
the
same
as
the
smell
wasnt
so
dull
this
would
be
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pretty
dry
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
i
could
easily
drink
several
more
bottles
yep
this
a
party
beer
the
low
abv
and
well
balanced
flavors
enhance
the
drinkability
would
be
an
excellent
session
oktoberfest
goose
island
knows
what
its
doing
taste
is
mellow
roasted
malt
sweet
caramel
nuts
and
a
nice
hops
tang
at
the
finish
a
little
thin
and
carbonic
but
very
drinkable
and
tasty
another
goose
hits
the
spot
for
me
a
consistently
solid
brewery
and
this
is
another
example
of
the
fine
beers
they
produce
try
some
this
thing
doesnt
stand
out
above
the
rest
but
it
was
enjoyable
fairly
alelike
in
taste
yet
it
comes
in
a
little
dry
as
well
its
a
bit
hoppy
though
which
balances
a
nice
toasty
malt
aspect
i
can
catch
another
touch
of
smokiness
toward
the
end
which
has
been
a
nice
touch
in
all
these
oktoberfest
beirs
this
past
season
the
body
is
mediumfull
leaves
a
nice
light
herbal
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
slightly
dry
but
very
quenching
very
drinkable
i
must
buy
more
before
stock
runs
dry
pours
a
nice
burnt
copper
color
which
is
what
i
would
expect
for
an
oktoberfest
the
head
was
34
of
a
finger
and
then
dissapeared
quickly
the
smell
is
very
nutty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
was
actually
thick
and
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
possibly
a
little
to
much
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
what
i
would
call
a
very
good
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
roasted
and
caramel
pretty
standard
the
flavor
is
roasty
and
caramel
with
a
rather
forceful
hop
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
the
feel
is
well
on
the
thin
side
of
moderate
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
ofest
ive
had
tasted
112004
this
poured
out
a
semi
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
quickly
faded
down
to
a
scattering
of
bubbles
no
lacing
at
all
on
the
glass
aroma
was
of
sweet
and
toasty
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
was
more
of
the
same
with
dominant
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
lurking
in
the
background
it
left
a
lingering
sweetness
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
just
as
you
would
expect
for
the
style
drinkability
is
decent
with
no
real
qualities
setting
it
apart
from
other
oktoberfests
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
a
solid
version
of
it
thanks
to
bif
15
and
oracle
for
this
brew
all
in
all
a
decent
ofest
not
my
favorite
from
the
year
but
quite
drinkable
drinkability
is
solid
could
definitely
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
row
or
even
better
get
a
liter
stein
full
nothing
spectacular
but
anotehr
solid
effort
from
the
folks
at
goose
thanks
to
oldcrustacean
for
the
bottle
final
thought
nice
start
for
the
pub
club
as
far
as
goose
island
they
are
3
for
3
and
i
love
their
beer
clear
rubybronze
in
hue
with
a
coppery
influence
as
well
steady
animation
found
its
way
to
the
offwhite
head
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
one
finger
in
height
but
it
quickly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
subsequent
lacing
was
nonexistent
but
a
tight
cap
formed
from
nowhere
it
seemed
and
lasted
the
entire
consumption
it
is
a
handsome
beer
the
nose
is
clean
the
malt
offers
a
toasty
caramel
aroma
whiffs
of
tobacco
leaf
as
well
i
could
detect
some
grain
and
even
some
grassy
hops
at
the
back
the
nose
is
typical
for
the
style
aside
form
the
tobacco
which
adds
an
interesting
dimension
potency
is
modest
mildly
inviting
which
means
it
smells
good
but
it
doesnt
pump
my
nag
this
might
be
the
driest
ofest
ive
ever
tasted
there
isnt
much
sweetness
the
caramel
taste
is
secondary
and
not
very
rich
lordy
the
tobacco
leaf
taste
is
strong
and
mighty
dry
after
the
tobacco
is
a
very
lovely
taste
of
biscuits
hops
add
minimal
bitterness
but
some
grassy
flavors
find
my
tongue
the
finish
is
much
better
than
the
start
and
the
most
complex
moments
are
when
the
middle
turns
to
the
end
very
good
dried
tobacco
leafs
and
biscuits
go
good
together
who
knew
i
think
some
sweetness
would
have
improved
this
beer
i
cant
complain
as
is
but
this
ofest
might
be
truly
amazing
if
the
sweetness
was
kickedin
medium
in
body
but
too
thin
more
malt
please
dry
leafy
aftertaste
hell
there
is
even
some
cocoa
mixed
in
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
just
as
enjoyable
i
purchased
a
sixpack
in
omaha
ill
enjoy
every
bottle
maybe
at
once
with
such
a
low
abv
worth
trying
obtained
via
trade
with
the
ever
so
gracious
bdorf94
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
burgundy
with
a
small
1
finger
whiteoff
white
head
aroma
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
einbecker
mai
urbock
that
i
had
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
a
light
maltiness
is
present
in
the
nose
that
is
fairly
sweet
taste
is
definetely
not
overthetop
or
abrasive
in
any
way
a
light
maltiness
is
the
the
dominant
flavor
in
this
brew
it
finishes
with
the
same
slight
sweetness
that
ive
experienced
in
all
of
my
previous
enconters
with
this
style
not
bad
but
i
still
prefer
ayingers
ofest
to
this
one
mothfeell
is
excellent
the
low
carbonation
works
great
with
style
easy
beer
to
drink
i
could
see
having
several
in
one
sitting
so
far
this
is
heads
shoulders
over
most
of
the
domestic
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
sampled
tried
this
approriately
enough
at
the
goose
island
oktoberfest
beer
academy
they
had
to
use
at
least
one
of
their
own
beers
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
crisp
malt
scent
the
taste
is
focused
on
nutty
dark
malt
flavors
with
just
enough
spicy
hops
to
balance
goes
down
incredibly
easy
and
the
nutty
malt
flavors
make
it
interesting
enough
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
brew
as
a
former
chicago
resident
im
always
excited
to
try
a
new
goose
brew
and
i
must
say
id
have
to
rank
this
one
right
up
there
with
my
favorites
it
pours
a
nice
clear
oaken
color
the
smell
is
subtle
but
sweet
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
all
in
all
a
great
beer
and
one
that
definitely
helps
capture
the
character
of
the
autumn
season
finished
nice
and
clean
very
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
row
overall
a
very
nice
ofest
i
will
be
buying
this
again
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
the
appearance
on
this
one
is
not
disappointing
however
a
dark
golden
copper
and
an
ok
head
smell
is
kind
of
bland
but
i
do
pick
up
some
malt
sweetness
taste
is
also
malty
and
sweet
not
very
balanced
a
bit
too
heavy
and
hard
to
drink
even
considering
its
low
abv
however
it
is
a
decent
brew
and
worth
a
purchase
if
nothing
else
seems
appealing
this
is
a
good
football
beer
it
would
be
a
good
choice
for
your
tailgate
party
or
cheering
from
the
couch
or
bar
stool
this
is
it
right
here
saw
this
and
the
sam
adams
entry
in
the
grocery
tonight
so
picked
up
a
sixer
of
each
the
sam
adams
was
unremarkable
but
this
is
just
about
perfection
in
an
oktoberfest
super
malty
flavor
very
very
roasted
almost
burnt
but
not
quite
nice
dark
color
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
i
knocked
it
down
a
notch
in
drinkability
simply
because
its
so
malty
that
i
dont
know
that
id
want
this
as
a
session
beer
and
it
may
overpower
milder
food
pairings
bring
on
the
brats
and
stinky
sauerkraut
though
but
i
dont
necessarily
view
this
as
a
bad
thing
the
drinkability
of
bud
light
is
off
the
charts
because
its
basically
water
right
overall
a
malt
lovers
dream
the
closest
to
a
liquid
version
of
eating
a
handful
of
malt
straight
out
of
the
brewers
bag
ive
had
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
a
little
outside
the
boundaries
of
normal
but
with
some
interesting
complexities
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
fermented
with
a
lager
yeast
oh
wait
isnt
that
an
oktoberfest
goose
island
oktoberfest
is
not
a
topnotch
version
of
the
style
i
may
be
influenced
by
the
great
lakes
eliot
ness
that
i
drank
last
week
note
which
has
since
been
reclassified
as
a
vienna
lager
but
my
ofest
bar
is
set
a
little
higher
these
days
drinkability
is
decent
the
flavor
is
a
bit
muted
but
solid
this
oktoberfest
was
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
got
it
in
a
12pack
gi
sampler
looks
nice
standard
orangeish
oktoberfest
color
smells
like
an
oktoberfest
tastes
like
an
oktoberfest
maybe
a
hint
of
metallicness
still
a
good
tasting
brew
though
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
but
i
probably
never
will
this
oktoberfest
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
and
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
mildly
fruity
with
hops
and
sweet
malt
caramel
coming
through
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
oakiness
and
fruitiness
and
a
good
bit
of
hops
piney
and
then
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
good
flavor
but
a
tad
thin
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
up
front
but
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
this
goose
i
got
in
a
christmas
pack
so
it
had
alittle
age
to
it
maybe
that
affected
the
pour
and
appearance
but
it
appeared
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
high
carbonated
head
that
faded
to
nothing
quickly
no
lace
at
all
the
aroma
was
malty
the
taste
followed
up
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
sweet
it
reminded
me
of
some
other
malty
holiday
winter
brews
that
were
to
sweet
the
mouth
feels
a
slight
hop
finish
while
drinkability
can
be
a
matter
of
opinion
the
weak
flat
appearance
of
this
light
bodied
october
cant
be
overlooked
there
was
no
party
in
my
glass
thanks
to
phantomvoodoo
for
the
trade
overall
a
solid
oktoberfest
a
foamy
offwhite
head
rests
lazily
slowly
receeding
in
height
over
a
copper
body
with
brass
and
gold
highlights
many
fine
bubbles
are
visible
rising
quickly
to
take
their
place
in
que
beneath
the
head
the
retention
is
good
but
it
leaves
only
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
toasty
and
juicy
sweet
due
to
its
vienna
malts
with
a
light
touch
of
floral
hops
as
accent
the
body
is
solidly
medium
and
its
creamy
in
the
mouth
despite
its
somewhat
effervescent
appearance
bready
gently
sweet
and
mildly
caramelish
toasted
malt
dominates
the
flavor
upfront
but
soon
reveals
its
balancing
bitterness
and
a
delicate
hop
flavor
it
finishes
dry
with
a
flash
of
doughy
toasted
malt
and
some
residual
hop
spiciness
quite
nice
drinkability
good
overall
balance
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
give
this
one
a
few
bonus
points
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
these
they
are
going
fast
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
just
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
and
malty
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
pretty
malty
with
caramel
and
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
the
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
though
a
decent
oktoberfest
pours
with
a
mostly
clear
apple
cider
copper
color
but
without
much
of
a
head
a
pleasantly
malty
nose
with
a
spicysweet
twinge
at
the
edge
that
sweetness
carries
over
to
the
palate
which
is
dominated

roasted

almost
from

though
they
come
through
with
their
greatest
crispness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
to
the
point
of
masking
the
somewhat
clingy
sweetness
that
is
present
as
well
quite
drinkable
in

quite

german
counterparts
thank
goodness
for
a
sale
at
a
local
supermarket
when
poured
this
beer
had
a
small
sized
ivory
head
that
was
creamy
and
smooth
and
consisted
of
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
fully
and
quickly
dissipated
the
body
was
clear
with
carbonation
observed
and
the
hue
was
an
amberorange
combination
the
nose
was
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
bitter
and
hoppy
flavor
this
beer
tastes
like
an
apaipa
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
lightmedium
bodied
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
this
beer
poured
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
weak
but
there
were
some
malts
there
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
some
flavors
i
was
expecting
but
it
had
a
hoppyness
to
it
as
well
as
a
slightly
interesting
sour
characteristic
not
sure
where
it
comes
from
but
this
was
its
drawback
fairly
smooth
to
drink
and
moderately
enjoyable
and
well
priced
poured
at
deep
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
lace
that
left
distinct
rings
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malty
smell
along
with
some
spices
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
sweetness
almost
sugary
tiny
amount
of
bittering
to
balance
mouthfeel
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
decent
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
one
setting
but
not
my
favorite
fest
beer
clear
dark
orangecopper
color
nice
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
thick
lace
in
the
glass
has
a
light
roasted
malty
caramel
aromas
sweet
and
roasty
malt
flavors
finishes
clean
light
to
medium
body
a
little
thin
and
semiwatery
mouthfeel
decent
ill
pass
on
this
one
from
now
on
bright
copper
or
orange
color
tight
bubbly
off
white
head
light
toasted
and
malt
smells
not
much
else
decent
taste
sweet
oktoberfest
flavors
come
through
but
seems
to
be
an
odd
sourness
underneath
everything
not
stale
or
old
but
just
sour
malty
richness
seems
to
fade
quick
hop
bite
a
bit
slick
but
not
thin
bodied
just
misses
on
the
toasted
malt
flavors
i
thought
i
would
get
pretty
good
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
and
i
am
in
no
way
a
style
nazi
so
lets
just
call
this
a
nice
amber
lager
ng
finishes
a
bit
dry
but
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
smooth
probably
my
favorite
ofest
so
far
this
year
color
is
a
dirty
reddish
brownbronze
with
a
thin
offwhite
loose
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
and
no
real
lace
smell
is
of
light
roastyness
and
faint
baked
cracker
with
a
smidge
of
herbal
hops
taste
is
very
tame
and
calm
light
toasted
caramel
subdued
sweetness
is
light
up
front
as
well
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
herbal
bite
coming
in
midway
and
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
malts
in
the
clean
crisp
finish
with
a
lingering
malty
sweet
cracker
dry
finish
which
is
nice
feel
is
a
close
to
medium
body
leaning
more
towards
lighter
though
lightly
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
a
good
drinkin
ofest
but
not
a
keeper
needs
a
boost
in
every
aspect
especially
the
toastyness
i
come
to
favor
in
this
style
pellucid
tawny
bronze
hue
thin
middling
light
beige
head
leaves
spotty
semi
lace
mildly
toasty
cracker
like
vienna
malt
with
stately
hints
of
medium
lovibond
caramel
comprise
the
aroma
and
are
accompanied
by
an
understated
herbal
tracely
spicy
hop
nose
clean
functional
continental
malt
character
in
aroma
dilatory
wash
of
sugary
caramel
upfront
in
flavor
lingers
a
bit
too
long
after
a
deliberation
caramel
malt
is
contrasted
by
a
lightly
drying
combination
of
simple
buttery
cracker
and
mild
floral
tinged
hop
bitterness
malt
character
deepens
agreeably
late
and
approaches
that
of
burnt
toffee
cut
with
carob
lightly
bodied
with
a
mouthfeel
thats
lean
yet
with
a
diluted
syrup
like
viscosity
finishes
sweetly
herbal
and
with
a
balmy
nuttiness
with
fleeting
hints
toasted
oily
pecan
almost
a
good
marzen
it
lacks
sufficient
malt
heft
and
showcases
a
simple
caramel
malt
driven
profile
overall
regardless
its
a
clean
drinkable
brew
without
outright
flaw
goose
island
doesnt
produce
a
bad
beer
clear
and
dark
amber
this
beers
pours
to
produce
a
rather
small
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
mellow
sweet
malts
pleasant
gooses
signature
hop
character
is
definitely
in
there
along
with
a
slightly
thick
maltiness
the
malt
character
is
sweet
and
not
overdone
as
to
provide
a
very
nice
drinkability
to
this
brew
here
is
another
local
beer
for
me
that
strengthens
my
love
for
the
goose
island
brewery
a
very
nice
goose
island
offering
that
is
quite
interesting
in
flavor
the
look
is
very
interesting
having
a
nice
amber
hue
but
with
lovely
ruby
tinges
that
flow
through
the
body
the
head
was
reasonable
though
quickly
fleeting
and
there
was
a
small
lace
component
the
malty
nose
was
joined
by
a
most
delightful
spice
sense
in
the
flavor
i
would
view
this
beer
as
being
quite
drinkable
in
a
session
the
feel
is
full
without
being
over
the
top
and
the
overall
impression
and
presentation
is
solid
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
do
so
again
especially
with
a
nice
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
at
hand
this
ones
a
copper
colored
beer
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
the
smell
is
a
caramel
malt
aroma
this
is
also
the
backbone
of
the
taste
topped
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
flavor
this
beer
isnt
very
strong
tasting
and
i
would
want
a
little
more
zip
in
my
oktoberfest
you
would
probably
be
better
off
getting
a
different
brands
take
on
this
style
but
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
out
there
either
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
from
an
october
fest
style
beer
the
flavor
is
good
just
different
than
expected
has
a
hop
and
roasted
malt
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
sam
adams
pours
to
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
good
long
lasting
head
excellent
overall
beer
just
not
a
great
october
fest
beer
color
is
a
nice
rubyish
hue
head
is
tannish
but
disssipates
too
quickly
aroma
is
fresh
flavorful
with
seafoam
and
some
hops
but
not
a
preponderance
taste
is
rich
and
malty
sweet
but
tangy
it
seems
like
a
lagery
style
of
oktoberfest
unless
im
terribly
wrong
tastes
quite
good
though
nice
and
sweet
but
a
bit
thin
for
my
own
personal
taste
quite
satisfactory
and
delicious
on
draft
enjoyed
this
with
a
ham
muenster
on
rye
hits
the
spot
thus
while
my
score
may
be
low
that
should
not
chase
people
away
from
exploring
a
very
good
beer
poured
a
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
beer
is
slightly
hazy
aroma
has
hints
of
roasted
caramel
and
malt

taste
has
a
nice
roasted

smokiness

somewhat
watery
sweet
initial

gives
way
to
an
interesting
tang
in
the
finish
oktoberfests
are
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
goose
islands
is
one
of
the
better
more
enjoyable
ofests
i
must
say
ive
been
rather
dissapointed
with
this
one
i
bought
a
sixer
because
goose
island
puts
out
some
pretty
tasty
brews
why
should
this
one
be
different
well
i
bought
the
beer
three
weeks
ago
and
i
still
have
two
bottles
left
clear
copper
color
medium
head
and
sufficient
lace
delicious
malty
nose
and
with
a
big
hop
whiff
delightfully
multidimensional
flavors
starting
with
caramel
rolls
and
candied
apples
ending
with
wooden
smoky
tastes
that
i
love
maybe
not
true
to
traditional
ofests
a
noble
hop
finish
coincides
with
a
satisfying
malt
body
this
brew
is
a
great
late
fall
early
winter
brew
with
its
layeredness
and
woody
overtones
delicious
most
flavorful
ofest
to
date
of
the
three
oktoberfests
i
had
this
weekend
petes
leines
and
goose
island
this
was
the
best
nice
red
color
albeit
with
little
head
retention
the
flavor
was
stronger
and
sweet
like
an
oktoberfest
should
be
an
excellent
marzen
and
worth
trying
the
beer
is
a
dark
chestnut
color
and
topped
with
a
small
beige
head
clean
malt
aroma
is
accentuated
beautifully
with
some
spicy
noble
hops
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
ofests
ive
had
along
with
schells
but
the
hops
really
complement
the
malt
nicely
in
this
beer
theres
a
nice
clean
toasty
malt
characteristic
accompanied
by
a
spicy
little
hop
twang
may
not
be
everybodys
cup
of
tea
but
i
find
it
enjoyable
and
a
tasty
changeup
from
many
of
the
ofests
body
is
mediumfull
a
slight
bitterness
lingers
which
seems
only
slightly
out
of
place
pretty
decent
brew
aroma
began
with
the
light
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
many
german
marzens
have
but
it
then
changed
to
a
heavier
malt
with
some
roast
qualities
with
a
shot
of
hops
to
boot
rather
thin
head
that
left
early
very
amber
in
color
and
clear
heavier
roast
flavor
than
most
of
this
style
ive
been
drinking
this
year
almost
like
its
getting
closer
to
a
bock
fairly
distinct
bitterness
is
flavor
but
has
a
short
finish
now
i
know
why
others
are
writing
a
tastey
beer
but
not
necessarily
a
good
marzen
i
agree
feel
is
medium
to
heavy
with
ample
carbonation
i
would
expect
better
from
one
of
the
breweries
i
am
fond
of
yet
still
very
drinkable
i
am
not
sure
if
i
should
begin
comparing
this
brew
to
the
german
marzen
beers
this
brew
pours
with
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
small
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
sharp
with
hints
of
caramel
sweentess
the
flavor
is
deep
not
aggressively
malty
and
with
a
strong
hop
spiciness
there
is
a
bit
of
bread
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
the
yeast
character
is
completely
different
than
any
of
the
german
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
sampled
this
year
goose
island
oktoberfest
not
really
an
oktoberfest
but
an
extremely
tasty
beer
deep
amber
in
color
not
a
classic
orange
the
aroma
is
clean
and
light
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
spice
the
initial
taste
is
very
heavy
malt
without
the
classic
marzen
taste
with
a
quick
clean
bite
of
hops
the
taste
is
noticeably
goose
island
and
too
me
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
as
it
warms
the
taste
mellows
considerably
with
a
more
prominent
marzen
taste
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
its
probably
not
an
oktoberfest
but
that
is
ok
because
id
drink
this
all
year
long
decent
all
around
but
not
one
of
the
great
oktobers
a
dark
copper
in
color
white
lace
on
top
that
rims
the
glass
as
you
drink
nose
is
subdued
but
there
is
some
toastiness
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
it
has
that
standard
goose
island
taste
almost
like
an
english
brown
ale
flavor
some
toasty
notes
on
the
sweeter
side
there
is
a
definite
subtle
hop
profile
not
packed
with
flavor
like
some
of
the
other
heavier
octoberfests
overall
this
is
decent
and
goes
down
nice
but
it
doesnt
rate
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
ofests
darker
brown
amber
not
much
orange
clear
with
slight
sediment
bits
head
is
big
at
first
settles
to
a
skim
in
a
minute
or
so
sweet
and
sugary
smells
pretty
thick
for
a
fest
heavy
caramel
and
honey
flavors
with
an
evident
but
not
balancing
hop
of
straightforward
bittering
this
brew
strays
into
bock
territory
in
my
opinion
i
liked
it
but
would
recommend
it
to
people
prefering
more
body
and
heavier
sweetness
no
off
tastes
but
not
a
good
representative
of
style
to
me
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
nice
and
malty
well
balanced
with
the
brewerys
characteristic
hops
a
find
a
comfortable
chair
and
have
a
few
beer
o
this
is
a
stellar
beer
id
put
this
head
shoulders
above
sam
adams
or
great
lakes
my
two
usual
marzen
bottle
pour
was
clear
orangebrown
with
minimal
head
aroma
was
toasted
malts
with
notes
of
bread
and
caramel
lots
of
malt
flavors
with
a
late
sweetness
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
soft
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
found
this
at
a
place
in
sf
whenever
they
have
it
i
gotta
order
it
not
too
many
quality
märzens
out
there
but
this
is
definitely
one
paulaner
octoberfest
my
gold
standard
for
octoberfest
beers
paulaner
oktoberfest
was
one
of
my
first
expeditions
outside
the
macro
brew
box
to
this
day
15
years
later
it
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
malty
yeasty
and
smooth
as
the
day
is
long
from
the
first
taste
to
the
last
a
very
good
beer
smells
good
tastes
good
poured
or
right
from
the
bottle
well
worth
it
boo
this
beer
is
bad
o
very
nice
but
i
prefer
hackerpschorr
overall
nice
well
balanced
märzen
very
malty
a
touch
sweet
not
a
big
fan
of
this
oktoberfest
ive
had
much
better

ive
encountered

full
of
flavor
like
the
finish
super
tasty
low

minus
an
aggressive
pour
it
has
a
good
light
brown
red
color
and
light
grainy
taste
it
goes
surprisingly
well
with
any
good
spicy
beef
and
potato
dish
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
shortlasting
white
head
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
nice
aromas
of
dark

raisins
and
hints
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
takes
this
and
amplifies
it
adding
a
nice
bready
quality
the

is
lighter

not

a

after

overall
decent
marzen
i
assume
this
is
their
export
version
and
their
weisn
is
the
version
sold
in
munich
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
marzens
ive
had
the
beer
isnt
overly
sweet
and
actually
has
a
substantial
amount
of
bitterness
that
i
find
lacking
in
other
examples
of
the
style
pours
a
pretty
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
light
to
moderate
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toasted
malts
and
yeast
and
is
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
even
better
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
just
this
side
of
medium
bodied
but
perfect
carbonation
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
and
a
tasty
example
of
this
style
of
brew
one
of
the
best
ones
out
there
prost
overall
for
me
marzens
walk
a
fine
line
of
sweetness
and
this
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
not
too
sweet
with
the
perfect
amount
of
hop
spice
to
counterbalance
the
carameltoasted
malts
a
great
fall
beer
and
one
that
will
be
my
goto

rich
and
malty
but
impressively
drinkable
the
way
an
oktoberfest
should
be
overall
maybe
this
style
of
beer
is
my
favorite
its
traditional
refreshing
and
not
really
anything
bad
about
it
i
could
crush
a
sixer
of
this
with
no
problems
its
not
adventurous
yet
isnt
infected
either
just
a
good
wholesome
brew
to
watch
football
or
any
sport
for
that
matter
this
brew
is
worthy
overall
the
sum
is
greater
than
that
of
the
parts
it
doesnt
look
particularly
beautiful
or
smell
enticing
but
its
a
very
smooth
balanced
malty
beer
that
fits
in
between
a
helles
and
a
dunkel
as
i
think
it
should
there
is
nothing
particularly
interesting
about
the
flavors
either
but
also
nothing
offensive
in
some
respects
i
think
a
good
drinkable
beer
should
not
be
over
the
top
this
one
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
when
you
finish
your
glass
youll
most
likely
be
wanting
more
thats
probably
a
good
mark
of
a
festbier
love
this
time
of
the
year
when
the
sweet
marzens
of
octoberfest
appear
very
easy
drinking
smooth
and
a
great
reason
to
fill
up
ein
mass
and
sit
under
some
linden
trees
in
a
bier
garden
prosit
not
bad
with
its

and
ok

malty
sweet

taste
with
a
touch
of
spice
biterness
and
bready
malts
pretty
balanced
and
a
decent
beer
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
definitely
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
beer
that
i
could
easily
have
over
and
over
again

final
thoughts
although
it
was
past
the
best
before
date
paulaner
oktoberfest
märzen
still
delivered
very
good
flavor
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
beers
made
in
this
style
but
i
think
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
cant
wait
to
find
it
in
season
in
a
few
months
o
what
a
great
lager
id
only
had
sam
adams
oktoberfest
before
this
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
darned
good
and
looked
forward
to
it
every
autumn
this
was
just
such
an
incredibly
better
oktoberfest
beer
paulaner
oktoberfest
is
available
at
my
bottleshop
year
round
and
its
going
to
be
a
trial
to
make
myself
wait
until
autumn
to
buy
it
overall
ive
had
paulaner
octoberfest
before
but
havent
reviewed
this
is
a
tasty
solid
ofest
not
too
sweet
or
too
boozy

balanced

2oz

beutifully
clear
reddish
gold
color
nose
is
boozy
and
malty
with
a
light
herbal
finish
initially
malty
and
sweet
ending
somewhat
dry
and
lightly
hoppy
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
and
simple
lacks
the
depth
of
flavors
that
would
make
it
world
class
but
still
enjoyable
and
tasty
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
solid
marzen
but
the
diacetyl
admittedly
gets
to
me
in
no
time
worth
it
to
try
as
a
yearly
fix
but
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
o
4
5
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
with
little
to
weigh
it
down
so
i
say

paulaner
jawohl
paulaner
certainly
makes
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
one
thats
rich

and
incredibly
easy
to
put

i
havent
picked
this
up
often
in
the
past
but
will
come
next
september
thanks
for
opening
my
eyes
matt
prost
lampertland
o
more
than
anything
i
think
this
style
not
this
brew
is
very
underwhelming
it
doesnt
do
any
one
thing
all
that
well
and
isnt
having
that
sumisgreaterthantheparts
quality
disappointing
coming
from
paulaner
but
again
the
framework
of
the
style
appears
to
be
limiting
overall
more
evidence
that
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
lager
especially
an
oktoberfest
you
should
really
go
with
a
german
lager
paulaners
oktoberfest
balanced
noble
hops
floral
and
mintyness
with
toasted
bread
and
molasses
malt
character
overall
it
just
feels
run
of
the
mill
and
quite
ordinary
but
not
horrible
by
any
means

around
clean

well

and
very

brought

from
munich
all
aspects
consistent
with
other
reviews
dominant
characteristics
of
malt
and
breadd
i
actually
prefer
the
darker
oktoberfests
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
definitely
going
to
look
for
this
locally
perfect
balanced
beer
although
quite
malty
straight
forward
but
still
satisfying
o
almost
feels
like
drinking
liquid
bread
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
if
i
were
to
use
this
beer
as
the
standard
for
octoberfest
marzens
i
must
say
that
i
prefer
samuel
adams
victorys
and
ayingers
take
on
the
style
nevertheless
i
find
this
beer
more
pleasing
than
weihenstephaners
oktoberfestbier
and
other
blonde
fest
beers
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
but
not
in
my
top
3
of
octoberfest
beers
its
great
to
have
found
another
german
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
especially
for
those
into
malt
in
a
crisp
lager
overall
a
very
nice
experience
i
only
got
two
in
a
mix
six
but
would
definitely
drink
a
six
of
this
sitting
in
my
back
yard
relaxing
a
great
octoberfest
beer
consistently
enjoyable
beer
that
helps
put
you
in
the
mood
for
oktoberfest
easy
to
drink
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
nice
malty
flavors
mouthfeel
may
be
just
a
tad
thin
but
certainly
no
problem
never
a
disappointment
there
may
be
better
choices
but
youll
not
be
disappointed
with
this
beer
o
a
favorite
and
a
must
get
for
the
season
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
and
tasty
oktoberfest
with
a
nice
sweet
and
decently
roasted
taste
paulaner
is
a
classic
brewery
for
a
reason
they
make
good
stuff
o
a
great
beer
i
had
been
growing
tired
of
the
american
attempts
and
finally
found
this
one
on
the
shelf
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
now
that
the
authentic
german
beers
are
popping
up
for
octoberfest
season
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
to
describe
this
one
i
like
it
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
taste
to
it
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
it
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
it
is
not
a
standout
brew
but
not
one
i
would
send
back
i
have
a
case
and
plan
to
enjoy
them
all
this
is
the
benchmark
marzen
in
my
opinion
the
appearance
is
a
beautiful
copper
color
as
one
would
expect
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
with
caramel
notes
the
taste
separates
this
brew
in
that
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
marzen
not
overly
malty
like
most
just
has
the
malt
hits
the
palate
the
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
and
equalizes
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
soft
making
for
one
special
oktoberfest
brew
definitely
a
great
beer
if
you
find
it
buy
it
lots
of
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
im
glad
to
know
they
brew
this
year
round
so
it
will
never
be
a
stranger
in
my
fridge
das
bier
ist
gut
well
malted
simple
and
easy
drinking
i
cant
find
the
ingredient
list
whole
foods
told
me
it
had
4
ingredients
without
sugar
i
dont
know
how
to
find
the
exact
whereabouts
for
said
ingredients
help
i
am
looking
for
an
organic
beer
without
sugar
basic
ingredients
nice
flavor
and
no
sugar
or
side
additives
this
beer
gave
a
nice
buzz
taste
good
but
want
to
know
ingredient
list
overall
refreshing
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
a
very
good
oktoberfest
one
of
my
top
picks
in
the
category
overall
this
is
one
special
beer
the
aforementioned
color
is
unique
the
nose
is
big
the
taste
and
mouth
are
complexsophisticated
i
dont
mean
to
be
so
highfalutin
but
i
dont
know
how
else
to
explain
whats
going
on
here
overall
it
is
very
very
smooththis
is
great
oktoberfest
marzens
that
you
can
enjoy
very
well
done
overall
a
nice
banquet
beer
probably
better
enjoyed
in
mass
quantity
from
a
gigantic
glass
stein
this
beer
is
enjoyable
forgive
my
lack
of
a
qualitative
review
of
the
four
senses
for
this
beer
but
i
am
new
to
being
able
to
describe
a
beer
with
a
detailed
level
of
description
i
will
say
that
having
long
out
grown
the
introductory
light
beers
that
most
americans
are
experienced
with
that
this
beer
is
on
my
list
of
brews
i
would
not
mind
picking
up
again
at
the
store
the
after
taste
is
bready
and
pleasurable
a
joy
to
drink
o
a
perfectly
solid
tasting
oktoberfest
lager
i
wouldnt
change
a
single
thing
about
this
brew
as
it
is
definitely
not
one
to
disappoint
for
lager
lovers
this
has
now
become
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
which
trumped
my
once
beloved
1
sam
adams
oktoberfest
just
what
you
would
expect
to
experience
with
an
exceptional
clean
cut
lager
best
served
cold
35
degrees
in
a
tulip
glass
o
holding
very
well
to
what
you
would
want
from
a
german
oktoberfest
beer
smooth
sweet
easy
on
the
way
down
good
märzen
but
i
would
almost
have
to
reach
for
their
wiesn
instead
when
oktoberfest
rolls
around
o
a
refreshing
german
marzen
lighter
than
most
americans
but
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
a
number
of
germans
i
especially
appreciate
that
it
lacks
the
american
trend
of
overhopping
every
style
but
still
has
enough
present
to
prevent
any
sense
of
sweetness
id
include
this
in
a
sixpack
mixer
during
oktoberfest
season
overall
an
above
average
marzen
while
the
beer
makes
for
enjoyable
drinking
it
could
use
some
more
assertive
flavors
in
all
its
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
another
ofest
in
a
crowded
market
of
them
this
will
have
to
be
a
beer
i
revisit
for
a
rereview
i
think
because
i
know
ive
had
some
really
good
paulaner
beers
in
the
past
this
example
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
not
really
a
standout
for
me
but
delivers
what
im
looking
for
in
a
marzen
and
is
pretty
good
backup
option
a
woody
almost
paperlike
taste
begins
to
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
anyone
who
has
ever
played
a
woodwind
instrument
will
know
what
i
mean
this
woody
flavor
is
curious
if
not
offputting
and
further
reinforces
my
impression
that
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
chaotic
to
reign
in
the
ample
flavors
that
exist
the
carbonation
feels
a
shade
high
as
well
the
boldness
of
this
oktoberfest
is
laudable
but
it
could
use
some
refinement
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
red
amber
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
some
darker
roasted
grain
with
very
slight
chocolate
but
very
weak
tastes
of
some
dark
roasted
grain
but
not
many
specific
tastes
jump
out
carbonation
is
great
and
finishes
very
well
overall
an
average
beer
i
would
have
been
more
satisfied
with
a
bolder
fuller
bodied
beer
a
decent
oktoberfest
not
fantastic
although
they
originated
the
style
i
tend
to
think
most
of
the
german
marzens
that
i
have
sampled
are
inferior
to
their
american
cousins
this
one
does
not
match
the
top
u
s
oktoberfests
but
it
comes
closer
than
any
german
marzen
i
have
tasted
so
far
pours
a
clear
dark
burnt
orange
with
a
medium
creamy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
freshly
milled
grain
taste
begins
initially
with
a
huge
light
caramel
sweetness
following
that
is
a
grainy
bready
middle
and
a
flowery
perfumy
finish
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
very
good
marzen
that
i
would
purchase
again
paulaners
oktoberfest
pours
a
brilliently
clear
copper
with
a
decent
amount
of
orange
highlights
roughly
a
finger
of
soapy
white
foam
comes
together
atop
the
beer
leaving
a
little
bit
each
of
head
retention
and
lacing
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
definitely
a
bit
dull
i
know
this
style
isnt
necessarily
supposed
to
have
the
most
bombastic
aroma
but
it
really
is
barely
there
there
are
some
light
toasted
bready
notes
as
well
as
just
a
hint
of
herbal
noble
hops
the
flavor
profile
while
following
the
nose
step
for
step
is
easily
more
potent
a
deceptively
deep
maltiness
leads
off
very
biscuity
in
nature
the
hops
are
again
playing
a
secondary
note
with
an
earthy
herbal
quality
present
against
the
dominant
malty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
bodied
with
just
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
cutting
through
paulaner
oktoberfest
is
a
really
nice
well
and
holds
up
better
than
some
of
the
other
german
imports
ive
had
it
is
a
fine
beer
on
its
own
if
you
like
the
amber
side
extremely
well
crafted
and
pure
it
is
one
of
the
original
beers
that
qualified
for
the
actual
oktoberfest
tested
by
time
and
true
a
flavor
of
history
that
is
so
damn
enjoyable
overall
drinkability
very
clean
and
refreshing
great
fruitiness
fall
is
here
o
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
clean
crisp
and
enjoyable
this
beer
is
smooth
medium
to
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
overall
impressed
with
this
beer
but
would
have
been
happy
to
see
more
maltiness
and
maybe
some
nuttiness
to
it
big
doses
of
lager
yeast
with
a
dense
grainy
malt
background
very
good
looking
beer
as
well
a
solid
pick
for
das
boot
o
by
no
means
is
this
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
i
never
have
a
problem
polishing
off
twothree
pints
of
this
in
one
sitting
a
greatclassic
example
of
an
oktoberfest
definitely
worth
a
try
prost
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
amber
bordering
on
dehydrated
piss
coloring
with
a
lovely
finger
width
head
of
soapy
white
bubbles
that
stick
around
the
color
actually
reminds
me
of
changing
leaf
colors
which
is
a
nice
nod
to
the
season
lacing
is
light
and
cloudy
with
just
a
few
dots
and
lines
edging
up
the
glass
the
body
is
clear
and
full
of
a
torrent
of
bubbles
that
are
racing
to
the
surface
the
beer
smells
surprisingly
spicy
with
yeast
that
has
an
almost
spicy
hot
tingling
in
the
nose
touches
of
bread
and
sweet
toasted
malts
are
clearly
present
with
a
nice
side
showing
of
earthy
hops
reminiscent
of
decaying
leaves
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
big
rush
of
decaying
leaves
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
which
wonderfully
offsets
the
sweet
malt
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
toasted
caramel
malts
before
it
opens
into
the
hops
earthyleafy
flavor
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
sweet
malts
transition
back
in
at
the
end
of
the
taste
and
into
the
aftertaste
along
with
the
spicy
yeast
notes
and
a
touch
of
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
just
a
smidge
to
thick
for
the
style
leaving
the
tongue
clean
but
for
a
touch
of
saliva
and
the
rest
of
the
mouth
slightly
dry
with
sweet
lingering
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
german
märzens
i
have
sampled
it
is
much
more
complex
in
flavoring
than
the
others
with
some
wonderful
yeast
spices
unfortunately
this
also
makes
the
beer
a
little
too
thick
to
continuously
slug
back
though
i
dont
really
see
that
as
a
huge
problem
as
i
could
still
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
the
course
of
a
day
good
beer
worth
a
try
and
a
retry
prosit
this
was
truly
a
wondrous
surprise
its
not
my
favourite
style
but
at
oktoberfest
you
have
to
drink
something
however
you
can
see
the
beauty
in
those
glasses
appearance
almost
a
5
clear
lovely
foamy
head
but
of
course
the
marzen
style
has
little
hop
aroma
so
no
extra
marks
for
smell
the
taste
was
delightfully
balanced
good
depth
of
malt
but
not
overpowering
in
the
slightest
overall
another
total
gem
from
phil
and
teds
world
tour
of
bavaria
do
not
underestimate
the
experience
of
tasting
the
beer
at
source
overall
this
is
a
solid
authentic
representative
of
this
style
as
should
be
coming
from
the
source
and
origin
of
the
style
drink
up
o
excellent
drinkability
a
perfect
german
session
lager
paulaner
quality
prost
o
good
oktoberfest
wish
the
skunk
aroma
wasnt
there
but
still
is
a
very
tasty
beer
pours
a
tawny
brown
with
about
an
inch
and
half
foamy
head
nice
bubbles
coming
off
the
bottom
of
the
drink
clear
as
crystal
weak
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
spice
and
floral
hops
some
citrus
also
nice
malt
sweetness
pulling
through
taste
of
slight
spices
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
low
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
little
watery
but
smooth
nonetheless
a
pretty
good
marzen
some
aspects
of
this
beer
suggest
that
paulaners
oktoberfest
märzen
may
be
one
of
the
best
märzens
out
there
i
suppose
ill
have
to
travel
to
munich
before
i
can
say
for
sure
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
german
ocktoberfest
beers
you
can
get
o
such
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
delicious
malty
profile
o
got
a
twelve
pack
of
these
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
i
didnt
knock
back
at
least
6
tonight
id
like
to
freeze
it
in
the
winter
so
i
could
skate
on
it
and
melt
it
in
the
spring
time
and
drink
it
o
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
little
more
sweetness
than
i
typically
like
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
overall
a
fairly
malt
forward
beer
that
has
good
malt
character
and
a
decent
amount
if
hops
to
keep
it
in
check
very
drinkable
brew
crystal
clear
copper
colored
liquid
topped
with
a
good
sized
frothy
white
head
lightly
sweet
doughy
aroma
fresh
grain
and
floral
hops
fresh
grainy
sweetness
nuts
and
earth
theres
some
kind
of
dry
dusty
blandness
that
follows
each
sip
and
drags
the
good
qualities
down
with
it
nice
firm
medium
body
not
the
greatest
could
use
some
more
rich
toasty
malt
to
counteract
the
cleanliness
o
i
really
liked
this
one
but
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
however
i
found
this
to
be
really
refreshing
and
a
good
drink
nonetheless
unfortunately
paulaners
rendition
of
this
seasonal
style
is
not
the
biscuity
bready
softly
balanced
moderately
abvenhanced
standardbearer
that
i
was
expecting
but
adequate
enough
in
what
it
does
offer
once
those
awkward
umami
moments
say
that
10
times
quickly
or
after
finishing
this
can
have
passed
and
nice
of
the
manufacturers
in
the
bavarian
land
to
allow
we
foreigners
to
experience
the
same
overindulgences
they
do
as
not
so
subtly
suggested
by
this
crazily
but
apt
bloated
serving
size
prost
i
guess
d
pretty
solid
oktoberfest
no
frills
true
to
the
grain
o
a
solid
munich
marzen
that
has
the
spicy
hop
profile
to
back
the
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
malt
base
not
overly
complex
but
great
flavors
that
provide
a
delicious
october
brew
the
dose
of
hops
may
be
a
tad
too
much
for
the
style
but
i
liked
it
due
to
the
fact
that
i
love
hops
be
sure
to
add
this
to
your
marzen
line
up
to
try
cheers
note
best
by
912
so
the
beer
wasnt
over
cellard
overall
this
is
a
total
honey
bomb
with
a
greater
emphasis
on
malts
than
hops
i
dont
know
that
i
could
session
this
but
its
certainly
good
for
a
try
here
and
there
would
i
buy
it
again
idk
so
many
god
beers
so
little
time
and
money
mouthfeel
is
light
but
deceivingly
so
due
to
the
dark
tint
of
the
beer
overall
its
a
standard
something
you
can
go
to
and
always
know
itll
be
decent
good
ol
germany
decent
beer
bratwursts
and
beautiful
longleggged
blondes
what
the
heck
else
do
you
need
to
be
happy
oa
bit
too
adjunct
tasting
for
me
this
really
isnt
how
i
like
my
german
oktoberfests
it
doesnt
have
a
good
taste
and
it
isnt
something
i
could
drink
all
might
long
fresh
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
with
a
solid
dose
of
white
foam
that
laces
nicely
bready
toasty
caramel
pretty
standard
oktoberfest
profile
clean
with
a
mild
floral
bitterness
a
touch
of
grapelike
fruitiness
dry
with
above
average
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
the
style
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
this
time
of
year
not
my
favorite
but
i
can
definitely
see
what
this
beer
has
going
for
it
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
drinks
quite
smoothly
with
a
slight
citrus
tang
at
the
finish
superb
rich
in
flavor
and
an
ideal
oktoberfest
a
winner
o
very
drinkable
session
beer
relatively
high
abv
is
well
hidden
o
by
the
standards
of
the
style
its
outright
fantastic
both
wonderfully
malty
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
this
one
is
a
joy
to
chug
one
of
the
best
marzens
ive
had
not
from
schlenkerla
which
is
a
whole
other
beast
entirely
pretty
nice
balanced
octoberfest
o
maltdriven
to
a
t
paulaners
oktoberfestmärzen
is
tasty
and
masterfully
brewed
but
it
departs
the
style
solely
in
that
i
dont
find
it
as
drinkable
as
other
german
oktos
of
the
same
ilk
very
good
indeed
i
quite
enjoy
it
i
just
wouldnt
choose
a
liter
of
it
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
amber
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
there
are
lots
of
tiny
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
behind
as
the
head
dissipates
there
are
aromas
of
bready
malt
and
grassy
and
floral
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
its
very
bready
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
strong
but
it
does
lend
some
nice
balance
to
the
flavor
the
body
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
definitely
give
it
a
try
m
medium
bodied
lighter
side
of
medium
carbonation
levels
o
a
great
example
of
traditional
octoberfest
this
one
will
always
be
on
my
top
list
it
has
everything
you
could
want
in
a
beer
overall
this
is
just
a
really
good
marzen
and
very
sessionable
im
surprised
it
doesnt
get
better
ratings
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
and
ill
choose
it
over
the
other
boring
predictable
seasonals
any
day
d
its
got
clean
flavors
is
balanced
relatively
well
and
is
easy
drinking
but
it
is
a
little
boring
and
definitely
simple
i
could
go
either
way
on
this
one
aaaand
since
thats
not
enough
characters
ill
just
let
everybody
know
that
i
love
my
dog
mouthfeel
is
solid
medium
light
body
supported
by
ample
but
not
excessive
carbonation
i
like
this
style
a
lot
but
must
wait
until
late
august
to
get
a
really
good
sampling
the
body
is
light
to
medium
it
coats
the
mouth
a
little
but
itsnt
drying
classifies
as
refreshing
a
very
sessionable
beer
with
great
balance
and
full
flavor
not
the
best
octoberfest
out
there
but
a
traditional
flavor
nailed
very
enjoyable
trader
joes
was
selling
big
huge
aluminum
barrels
of
this
stuff
i
exaggerate
but
the
cans
on
display
were
morethangenerous
more
apt
to
be
footstools
or
pieces
of
a
makeshift
barrier
than
a
beer
serving
size
still
splitting
one
of
these
azure
monoliths
with
a
friend
didnt
seem
too
greedy
orange
and
frothy
this
looks
like
a
festival
beer
good
for
celebrating
outdoors
where
heady
rays
of
sunshine
and
noise
from
adjacent
crowds
make
good
complements
to
the
otherwise
simple
notes
of
honey
paired
with
the
crispness
of
pilsner
malt
and
sharp
carbonation
unengaging
the
pauler
marzen
is
best
left
to
being
a
session
beer
or
served
with
powerful
dishes
or
to
slake
undiscriminating
thirsts
it
deserves
a
glass
boot
more
than
a
chaise
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
amber
and
smells
wonderful
the
malts
sing
out
and
make
me
wish
i
was
in
bavaria
drinking
a
mass
in
a
prosit
for
gemutlichkeit
i
forgot
to
add
this
review
when
i
had
this
in
the
fall
germans
love
it
and
you
will
too
it
is
worth
the
wait
for
89
more
months
oktoberfest
2012
malt
flavor
is
tops
but
it
is
not
sweet
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
that
you
wish
it
was
sold
by
the
liter
here
o
a
solid
oktoberfest
option
i
cant
put
it
in
my
top
five
but
its
good
overall
i
paired
this
with
an
episode
of
worlds
dumbest
and
it
went
down
pretty
well
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
a
very
good
allround
oktoberfestbier
lacking
just
a
little
bit
to
make
it
completely
outstanding
but
certainly
one
of
the
better
brews
of
its
style
out
there
overall
completely
drinkable
a
simple
brew
with
much
history
behind
it
i
consider
this
a
great
party
beer
you
can
knock
thee
down
without
being
worn
out
by
too
much
sugar
or
hops
i
cant
knock
it
but
i
also
wont
buy
it
often
just
because
marzens
arent
my
favorite
style
i
took
notes
on
my
phone
so
im
not
writing
this
as
i
drink
it
oin
a
tasting
of
american
and
german
octoberfest
beers
this
one
was
the
favorite
delicious
easy
to
drinkwhat
a
marzen
should
be
this
is
an
excellent
oktoberfest
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
great
in
all
department
i
highly
recommend
and
will
seek
out
again
this
one
feels
and
taste
rather
authentic
and
this
can
is
huge
sooo
fun
with
the
wonderful
paulerner
giant
mug
to
go
with
it
easily
the
highlight
of
my
oktoberfest
drinking
in
2011
given
my
general
taste
for
german
beers
i
was
disappointed
with
paulaner
for
this
beer
nothing
at
all
similar
to
any
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
in
general
i
would
prefer
a
heavier
less
wimpy
german
beer
for
the
most
german
of
all
holidays
overy
drinkablebut
it
must
be
cold
in
the
glass
o
normally
i
would
down
a
beer
for
these
light
characteristics
but
i
understand
that
a
oktoberfest
is
supposed
to
be
smooth
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
hits
all
these
qualities
and
i
could
imagine
a
large
group
of
people
drinking
this
all
day
at
a
festival
this
beer
is
nice
for
what
it
promises
and
yeah
i
could
drink
a
pack
of
this
on
a
hot
day
d
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
beer
just
what
a
oktoberfest
beer
should
be
good
malt
flavor
with
a
good
abv
for
the
style
worth
looking
for
pours
a
nice
dark
bronze
copper
with
nice
lasting
tan
head
aroma
of
toasted
barley
sweet
malt
bready
yeast
and
some
slight
fruity
notes
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
a
nice
medium
body
with
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
and
good
carbonation
finish
is
toasted
barley
and
sweet
biscuit
malt
with
some
yeast
and
light
fruity
notes
and
mild
sweet
bitter
ending
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
and
flavorful
brew
a
nice
autumn
brew
o
not
true
marzen
its
good
not
great
1l
is
an
awful
lot
for
this
beer
o
overall
a
decent
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
either
an
old
favorite
a
lacquered
tan
color
complemented
by
a
light
crisp
aroma
slightly
malty
with
a
clean
sharp
finishits
everything
i
want
in
a
marzen
not
sure
if
its
brewed
year
round
or
the
bottles
that
are
available
are
old
but
on
tap
its
fantastic
not
bad
i
know
its
regarded
highly
in
the
marzen
world
but
i
dont
think
its
as
good
as

while
theres
a
decent
core
of
malted
milk
balls
caramel
and
molasses
to
the

theres
also
a
surprising
amount
of
herbaceous

and
raw

at
times

it
as

overall
its

is
appealing
and
it
hits
the
sweet
spot
frequently
enough
to
stay
balanced
and
approachable
note
glass
supplied
is
large
enough
and
heavy
enough
to
warm
beer
quickly
overall
3
5
certainly
one
of
if
not
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
available
in
the
us
this
is
worth
picking
up
either
in
cans
or
bottles
ive
had
both
and
both
are
excellent
session
beers
and
are
also
excellent
with
food
particularly
my
favorite
german
dish
saurbraten
only
available
for
a
limited
time
so
buy
em
if
you
find
em
overall
probably
one
of
the
oktoberfests
you
could
skip
without
worry
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
very
sessionable
a
perfect
watching
the
leaves
fall
kinda
brew
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth

o
this
is
a

enjoyable
beer
anyone
looking
for
a
great
example
of
the
marzen
style
would
do
well
to
start
here
ogreat
example
of
the
style
and
up
there
with
the
best
of
marzens
definitely
worth
a
look
a
solid
oktoberfest
and
one
of
the
classics
to
use
as
a
starting
point
for
those
unfamiliar
with
the
style

some

here
a
fall
beer
through
and
through
d
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
easydrinking
maerzen
a
bit
shallow
maybe
but
perfect
to
knock
back
by
the
mass
prost
o
everything
about
this
seemed
just
slightly
above
average
and
then
the
odd
flavor
kind
of
threw
me
i
liked
the
brooklyn
oktoberfest
better
a
decent
lager
but
the
flavour
profile
gives
away
that
it
isnt
really
an
oktoberfest
i
just
had
to
have
the
giant
mug
and
can
when
i
saw
it
a
novelty
for
sure
but
i
love
my
new
mug
ill
never
have
a
reason
to
use
maybe
ill
start
reviewing
40s
just
so
i
can
use
the
mug
nice
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
with
medium
carbonation
that
left
small
traces
of
bubbles
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
a
very
smooth
drinkable
marzen
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
much
better
that
the
american
versions
rjt
d
quite
drinkable
goes
great
with
popcorn
cheers
overall
a
very
tasty
oktoberfest
drinkable
and
somewhat
light
true
to
style
and
most
excellent
with
the
season
the
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
very
malty
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
toffee
with
some
lighter
malts
mixed
in
as
well
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grape
character
to
the
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
in
there
as
well
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
bit
average
märzen
lacks
a
bit
of
character
and
distinction
there
are
more
inspired
märzens
around
2009
overall
impression
well
its
drinkable
but
just
a
little
sad
for
a
beer
that
used
to
carry
a
good
malt
character
to
it
i
might
have
a
couple
to
confirm
if
i
was
missing
something
in
the
first
one
just
a
bit
thin
this
year
overall
this
is
a
simple
surprisingly
flavorful
and
quality
oktoberfest
style
i
would
never
choose
to
drink
a
traditional
marzen
anytime
other
than
with
food
because
the
flavors
arent
distinctenjoyable
enough
more
often
than
not
but
this
makes
a
perfect
accompnayment
to
any
meel
when
you
dont
want
the
beer
to
shine
too
strong
over
the
meal
pairing
overall
much
different
than
any
other
oktoberfest
that
i
have
had
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
alot
cheers
poured
a
brilliant
orangeamber
color

a
smallish
beige
colored
head
a
little
spicy
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
some
cereal
and
rye
bread
on
the
palate
this
one
is
sweet
crisp
and
medium
bodied
with
some
caramel
toasted
malt
and
cereal
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
good
overall
not
bad
but
somehow
it
seems
to
be
the
american
brewers
are
doing
this
style
better
these
days
had
this
and
the
rest
of
the
paulaner
line
up
at
a
recent
oktoberfest
in
de
like
it
alot
o
very
tasty
oktoberfest
if
you
arent
a
big
oktoberfest
person
this
is
the
beer
that
will
turn
you
on
the
flavor
and
finish
were
all
very
nice
but
it
was
hard
to
get
over
the
smell
frothy
white
head
lasts
several
minutes
and
sits
upon
a
amberyellow
brew
a
little
bit
drier
than
i
expectedi
thought
thered
be
more
sweetness
from
the
malt
as
ive
found
in
other
märzens
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
as
the
beer
hangs
together
quite
well
and
is
probably
more
drinkable
as
a
result
of
the
drier
taste
and
crisp
finish
o
this
might
not
be
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
its
still
the
standard
by
which
i
judge
others
in
the
style
its
a
good
standard
example
of
the
style
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
okay
white
head
the
smell
is
a
grainy
bready
smell
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
somewhat
light
yet
good
i
get
the
bready
malts
with
a
little
toffee
at
the
end
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
one
of
many
ofests
finally
getting
sampled
this
year
took
me
long
enough
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
rusted
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
dustycream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
caramel
wheat
light
rye
bread
orange
zest
and
coriander
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
more
pronounced
caramel
flavor
and
an
addition
of
a
few
cashews
this
nuttiness
and
maltiness
really
helps
this
brew
pop
a
bit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
european
ofests
available
round
here
not
bad
at
all
a
refreshing
beer
and
about
as
good
as
a
marzen
thats
not
deliciously
smoked
can
get
overall
this
beer
is
just
ok
while
it
may
be
true
to
style
it
is
not
dynamic
it
is
meant
more
for
drinking
out
of
a
large
stein
in
the
open
air
than
sipping
in
the
living
room
that
said
the
former
scenario
sounds
like
a
great
time
dvery
drinkable
the
flavor
is
good
and
it
is
not
too
filling
it
would
be
great
to
spend
and
entire
day
at
oktoberfest
drinking
this

after

full
of
oktoberfests
this
season
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
good
beer
overall
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
a
marzen
tasty
and
pretty
easy
drinking
o
very
tasty
and
at
the
same
time
easy
to
drink
beer
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
oktoberfest
though
im
a
big
fan
of
paulaners
other
brews
pours
a
medium
brown
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
and
the
taste
is
smooth
but
for
a
marzen
it
just
seemed
a
little
flat
to
me
wanted
it
to
have
just
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
to
it
that
said
its
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
the
fallwinter
glad
i
got
a
six
pack
of
it
just
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
o
finally
a
good
oktoberfestbier
from
munich
after
the
likes
from
hofbräu
löwenbräu
and
spaten
i
was
beginning
to
loose
faith
this
one
from
paulaner
doesnt
contain
all
of
those
more
or
less
unpleasant
flavours
ive
encountered
with
the
others
its
drinkable
and
smooth
with
a
nice
fruity
herbal
and
spicy
touch
and
does
the
job
quite
well
for
me
this
poured
a
very
good
and
dark
orange
color
with
a
malty
head
classic
aromas
of
grains
a
lot
of
cereal
some
oranges
and
copper
tones
as
well
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
lot
of
malty
tones
and
some
oranges
on
the
palate
very
good
with
the
feel
being
what
was
best
on
the
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
would
have
never
known
this
is
6
quite
yummy
definitely
want
to
comp
pare
to
a
bottle
and
going
to
order
another
one
half
litre
bottle
no
real
head
retention
pale
colour
very
clear
smelled
hints
of
hay
this
beer
was
on
the
sweet
side
but
well
balanced
it
was
crisp
refreshing
and
went
down
very
well
wasnt
complex
but
thats
not
the
point
of
this
one
without
doubt
the
most
drinkable
oktoberfest
beer
ive
had
overall
drinkability
not
a
very
good
beer
not
good
for
its
style
either
i
liked
this
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
there
are
others
i
found
that
are
more
pleasing
to
my
tastebuds
and
to
my
wallet
o
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
the
season
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
setting
easy
to
drink
is
what
id
say
overall
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
biscuitlike
with
some
caramel
and
citrus
aromas
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
with
biscuit
caramel
and
some
citrus
zest
on
the
finish
there
is
really
no
bitterness
but
there
is
a
weird
astringency
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
astringent
aftertaste
i
am
getting
from
this
bottle
o
a
good
oktoberfest
very
straightforward
i
seem
to
like
those
offerings
in
the
style
that
branch
out
a
bit
from
this
it
doesnt
excite
me
in
any
one
regard
but
is
so
solid
in
all
i
bump
its
overall
rating
up
to
4
0
this
is
a
damn
fine
oktoberfest
smooth
and
nutty
upfront
with
raisiny
malts
finishes
up
with
some
nobletasting
hops
that
sneak
in
behind
the
big
mask
of
malt
while
that
sounds
big
nothing
here
is
overpowering
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
the
tastes
are
moderate
enough
to
drink
this
in
large
quantities
throughout
the
fall
which
by
the
way
hasnt
begun
yet
good
for
me
overall
nice
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
decent
nice
malts
some
good
hops
on
the
finish
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
a
clean
dry
finish
and
the
beginning
it
starts
slightly
watery
which
was
a
bit
of
a
throw
off
but
overall
it
was
nice
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
a
yearround
brew
that
one
can
drink
multiples
of
o
excellant
ofest
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
having
just
reviewed
sa
ofest
this
blows
it
out
of
the
water
the
sam
adams
tastes
weak
and
watery
in
comparison
final
thoughts
very
nice
i
would
drink
this
anytime
the
carbonation
level
could
be
a
bit
higher
and
help
things
come
together
otherwise
still
a
terrific
beer
overall
good
but
something
missing
for
my
tastes
anxious
to
try
more
oktoberfests
as
the
season
goes
on
o
a
classic
example
of
the
style
totally
reminds
me
of
fall
and
something
i
look
forward
to
getting
again
soon
o
i
am
not
a
huge
marzen
fan
but
this
one
is
better
than
most
of
the
american
takes
on
the
style
that
ive
had
i
could
see
gulping
down
huge
glass
steins
of
this
beer
all
day
long
while
eating
giant
pretzels
roasted
sausages
and
schnitzel
until
it
comes
out
of
my
ears
youll
want
to
keep
me
away
from
the
sauerkraut
and
sauerbraten
if
you
know
whats
good
for
you
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
really
nice
autumn
aromas
to
it
there
was
the
smell
of
dried
leafs
some
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
overly
spiced
at
all
it
was
rather
mellow
tasting
the
malts
were
the
biggest
part
of
the
flavor
there
wasnt
much
in
way
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
märzen

i
have
only
tried
a
few
offerings
from
paulaner
but
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
an
okay
oktoberfest
but
not
the
greatest
o
recommended
and
well
worth
a
try
based
on
drinking
this
i
will
be
trying
other
paulaner
offerings
this
beer
is
a
poster
child
for
the
style
and
it
does
very
well
as
such
i
do
believe
it
has
been
surpassed
by
exceptional
variations
such
as

also
a
bit
of
apple
very
well
put
together
taste
nice
clean
sweet
malt
to
start
light
hints
of
apple
again
in
the
middle
and
ends
with
a
mild
burst
of
grainy
hops
nothing
in
the
flavor
profile
truly
stands
out
but
mixes
together
perfectly
clean
crisp
and
very
refreshing
for
the
style
drinkability
is
great
taste
is
clean
almost
too
clean
with
very
little
flavor
gingerbread
and
a
hoppy
sweet
snap
in
the
middle
actually
its
blander
than
im
describing
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
euro
slickness
d
a
very
good
märzen
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
it
again
a
deep
amber
nearly
mahogany
color
with
an
average
uninspireding
offwhite
head
the
pour
yields
a
wonderfully
clean
softlyrich
simple
malt
aroma
featuring
subtle
touches
of
bubblegum
phenols
and
copperymetallic
qualities
the
flavors
are
spoton
uniquely
marzen
firm
light
and
smooth
malt
backbone
with
some
spicy
gingerbread
notes
flows
through
almost
flat
but
awesomely
satisfying
neat
drinkability
a
delicate
warm
rush
of
alcohol
chases
on
the
end
keeping
the
palate
fresh
and
alert
a
goto
this
will
probably
be
one
of
my
last
oktoberfests
of
the
year
i
love
fall
beer
selections
and
make
a
point
try
try
a
few
new
ones
each
year
this
poured
out
of
a
chilled
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
light
rust
color
with
almost
no
head
or
retention
my
overall
impressions
is
a
classic
oktoberfest
with
a
bit
of
a
livelier
feel
than
most
there
is
a
floral
caramely
taste
that
i
like
but
is
not
quite
right
for
the
style
in
my
mind
it
finishes
with
a
bitter
then
nice
and
bready
aftertaste
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
though
not
terribly
memorable
d
clean
and
very
drinkable
d
drinkable
enjoyable
wellmade
beer
however
i
personally
find
it
a
little
onedimensional
with
its
slightly
harsh
hops
and
muted
malt
flavors
ill
have
to
try
this
on
tap
d
good
oktoberfest
style
really
like
the
hop
characters
in
the
taste
and
nose
that
balance
it
out
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
next
year
for
the
oktoberfest
celebrations
ein
prosit
very
good
oktoberfest
but
still
cant
beat
hackerpschorr
d
easy
to
drink
and
nice
and
cooling
on
a
summers
day
chilled
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
drinkability
very
drinkable
comes
off
as
lighter
yet
still
pleasant
to
drink
but
it
is
lacking
in
abv
and
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
harvest
notes
the
mugs
gone
before
i
know
it
looks
great
tastes
very
good
which
is
whats
most
important
pours
a
moderate
orangebrown
with
a
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
my
pilsner
glass
the
nose
brings
some
light
hops
as
well
as
caramel
and
bread
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
plain
with
some
light
bready
notes
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
feel
is
nice
with
good
carbonation
hearty
drinks
quite
well
and
is
one
of
the
classics
for
me
at
least
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
which
makes
it
very
sessionable
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
oktoberfest
prost
got
another
bottle
for
christmas
brought
up
the
scores
for
taste
and
drinkability
really
great
flavors
for
an
oktoberfest
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
very
high
i
see
myself
going
back
to
the
bottleshop
for
another
6pack
of
these
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
with
hints
of
fruitiness
in
the
taste
earthy
dry
hops
and
ends
with
a
fruitiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
clean
small
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
nice
balance
and
earth
but
a
bit
too
fruity
dvery
very
very
smooooththis
is
one
of
your
oktoberfest
marzens
that
you
can
just
chill
out
and
enjoy
after
halfway
through
the
1st
one
i
was
already
for
my
2nd
cheers
to
all
another
quality
oktoberfest
brew
great
for
any
oktoberfest
or
for
any
time
of
the
year
for
that
matter
very
drinkable
and
nice
flavor
will
buy
again
as
it
is
easy
on
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
nice
even
carbonation
like
the
scent
and
taste
the
feel
is
a
little
lackluster
i
can
see
drinking
this
as
a
good
session
beer
but
its
not
one
i
would
buy
regularly
for
oktoberfests
its
satisfying
but
not
great
excellent
session
beer
very
drinkable
i
think
ive
found
my
new
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
actually
i
find
this
boring
could
have
been
any
macro
brew
overall
very
drinkable
and
excellent
example
of
the
style
bigger
hop
presence
than
i
would
have
anticipated
but
it
really
helps
reinforce
the
drinkability
and
crisp
finish
lighter
bodied
and
thirst
quenching
but
still
retains
a
nice
malt
complexity
and
firm
backing
hops
all
i
need
is
a
1
l
mug
d
overall
quite
good
but
staghorn
is
better
really
enjoyed
this
beer
during
oktoberfest
the
color
smell
and
taste
are
great
the
appearance
looks
average
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
it
is
not
hard
to
drink
i
would
definitely
find
myself
drinking
this
beer
not
just
during
oktoberfest
poussin
very
clear
orange
honey
colored
with
a
2
finger
hard
that
recedes
quickly
pretty
standard
color
wish
the
retention
lasted
longer
no
lacing
aroma
is
bready
malts
a
little
caramel
and
lager
yeast
has
a
nice
crisp
lager
bite
to
it
and
also
has
some
bready
characteristics
on
the
finish
nice
clean
finish
and
ample
carbonation
really
begs
for
roasted
chicken
dishes
even
roasted
pork
there
is
also
a
really
nice
clean
quality
to
this
that
makes
this
very
drinkable
and
perfect
this
time
of
year
great
package
too
with
the
glass
included
d
is
good
the
taste
and
the
way
it
feels
in
your
mouth
really
seem
to
go
together
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
this
beer
pleases
me
its
good
to
be
the
king
taste
a
little
bland
but
enough
heft
to
not
be
watery
like
a
lot
of
the
octos
from
this
side
of
the
pond
creamy
in
the
middle
in
terms
of
dryness
hops
and
alcohol
remain
pretty
undetectable
wanted
more
to
say
about
this
but
it
became
pretty
unremarkable
a
little
pricey
unless
youre
really
into
this
style
i
cant
see
this
being
anywhere
near
a
customary
purchase
d
very
drinkable
i
can
attest
after
5
liters
of
this
at
oktoberfest
honey
gold
in
colour
and
crystal
clear
has
a
well
retained
fluffy
white
head
greets
your
nose
with
aromas
of
lightly
toasted
bread
honey
and
floral
hops
tastes
of
biscuit
malt
honey
and
lemon
with
a
hint
of
caramel
pretty
good
beer
but
doesnt
really
match
my
expectations
going
in
either
its
only
a
shade
darker
than
most
of
the
pale
lager
styles
and
theres
really
only
the
slightest
hint
of
caramelized
and
toasty
notes
to
differentiate
it
in
terms
of
flavour
and
aroma
am
i
missing
something
here
its
a
light
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
nice
and
easy
doesnt
fill
you
youd
almost
think
it
was
made
for
drinking
in
large
quantities
d
definitely
want
another
the
taste
follows
with
nice
toasted
bready
malt
a
kiss
of
sweetness
from
caramel
malt
lingering
toast
and
noble
hop
earthy
bitterness
mild
pleasant
fruitiness
emerges
mid
way
through
the
pint
pretty
high
its
smooth
very
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
aftertaste
isnt
too
jaunting
to
disuade
decent
brew
with
hints
of
complexity
but
nothing
that
slaps
you
in
the
face
good
enough
taste
to
bring
me
back
drinkability
this
is
drinkable
enough
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
second
and
id
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
but
that
being
said
i
found
it
a
bit
lightly
favored
for
the
style
and
thought
both
the
color
and
the
malt
presence
should
have
been
more
definite
there
are
others
id
choose
in
preference
to
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
a
sweet
malt
a
little
bready
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
in
there
too
the
taste
is
not
as
potent
as
other
marzens
but
its
still
a
full
taste
it
has
a
sweet
bready
or
toasty
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hop
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
but
smooth
overall
an
enjoyable
beerbut
not
the
best
marzen
i
will
ever
taste
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
once
i
have
tried
all
the
other
marzens
i
can
get
my
hands
on
drinkability
is
quite
high
and
i
can
see
why
this
is
brewed
for
mass
consumption
not
overly
expensive
tastes
great
and
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
fall
dinner
football
game
on
tv
or
just
hanging
out
with
your
buddies
in
fact
i
think
as
long
as
they
arent
lite
beer
people
anyone
would
like
this
one
a
good
example
but
i
could
use
a
more
balanced
malt
profile
drinkability
id
have
another
but
there
are
better
offerings
drinkability
is
nice
above
average
flavors
and
mouthfeel
keep
you
engaged
but
not
yearning
for
more
d
for
me
the
drinkability
was
very
good
went
down
really
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
really
decent
beer
here
d
overall
a
decent
brew
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
a
little
more
flavor
and
a
little
mroe
weight
and
this
would
be
much
better
but
still
worth
a
try
from
a
legendary
brewery
drinkability
good
d
easy
drinking
nothing
offensive
a
classic
oktoberfest
the
beer
tastes
great
it
is
definitively
a
full
flavoured
beer
decent
hop
balance
however
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
depth
and
character
to
the
beer
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
is
not
well
masked
it
goes
down
a
little
rough
but
it
is
still
an
above
average
oktoberfestbier
ddelicious
easy
drinking
perfect
example
of
the
okto
style
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
it
rich
amber
goodness
is
my
friend
its
hearty
and
has
a
high
alcohol
content
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
going
down
better
than
any
beer
i
have
put
off
writing
anything
about
this
beer
because
i
like
it
so
much
that
i
really
dont
want
to
try
to
isolate
all
the
flavors
paulaner
oktoberfest
is
more
of
an
experiential
brew
for
me
one
day
i
shall
make
a
pilgrimage
to
munich
taste
very
easily
drinkable
as
far
as
taste
goes
slightly
spicy
with
sweet
malts
and
some
bitter
fall
fruit
flavors
noted
in
the
scent
quite
carbonated
the
whole
experience
has
a
nice
autumnal
vibe
to
it
had
this
beer
the
other
day
as
its
just
starting
to
come
around
for
the
season
ive
also
had
their
regular
original
helles
lager
style
beer
that
actually
smells
similar
to
this
but
this
has
a
bit
more
maltier
richer
smell
i
guess
because
of
its
marzen
style
it
tastes
like
their
helles
lager
but
with
a
maltier
taste
like
i
said
before
that
gives
it
a
richer
body
in
my
opinion
that
richer
body
really
gives
this
beer
the
higher
ranks
some
noble
hops
at
the
end
but
not
as
much
as
their
original
lager
all
around
a
good
octoberfest
beer
that
i
would
recommend
if
you
wanted
a
good
solid
import
german
beer
seems
like
a
thick
beer
despite
the
color
very
smooth
with
carbonation
thats
just
present
this
isnt
a
knock
out
beer
but
it
is
still
very
solid
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
while
i
have
tried
better
märzenoktoberfest
beers
this
one
still
holds
a
special
place
drinkable
has
a
light
consistency
and
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
could
easily
drink
a
few
malts
are
quiet
its
true
i
know
that
hops
forward
is
not
to
style
for
an
oktoberfest
but
this
is
still
a
pleasant
drinker
when
its
this
fresh
and
belies
its
6
abv
according
to
the
label
very
drinkable
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
fits
the
style
well
and
pairs
nicely
with
a
cool
fall
evening
would
certainly
buy
this
again
if
one
is
about
superior
taste
go
for
the
hackerpschorr
oktoberfestmärzen
paulaner
although
nearly
as
good
is
just
a
little
too
light
and
lacks
the
malty
chewyness
and
spice
of
better
märzen
still
a
great
drink
and
the
best
for
parties
overall
this
has
been
the
best
oktoberfest
of
the
season
ive
had
so
far
and
would
reccomed
it
to
someone
to
try
it
if
you
want
a
good
fall
beer
to
have
d
not
a
beer
you
should
pound
its
a
darker
thinker
style
fall
beer
beginner
beer
drinkers
and
or
people
who
prefer
lighter
style
beers
probably
wouldnt
enjoy
this
too
much
based
on
my
limited
experience
this
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
märzen
but
it
is
still
highly
drinkable
enabling
a
nice
buzz
once
again
paulaner
does
it
this
is
a
fine
marzen
good
amount
of
malt
toastiness
a
little
hoppiness
and
just
tasty
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
yet
from
them
i
dont
know
why
but
this
has
always
been
my
favorite
time
of
year
maybe
its
that
the
weather
gets
cooler
maybe
its
that
all
the
good
holidays
halloween
thanksgiving
are
coming
up
or
maybe
its
all
the
oktoberfest
beers
this
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
for
a
few
years
now
dark
copper
color
in
my
paulaner
dimpled
liter
mug
caramel
toffee
lots
of
malty
goodness
with
little
bitterness
tastes
different
to
me
than
years
before
cant
seem
to
put
my
finger
on
it
hmm
maybe
its
just
me
a
superb
ofest
imo
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
one
it
is
a
light
spicy
marzen
i
cant
help
but
enjoy
the
taste
even
if
this
style
isnt
in
general
one
of
my
faves
it
pours
transparreant
copper
gold
with
thick
white
head
quickly
fading
it
smells
of
spices
and
tastes
mush
the
same
way
with
alot
of
wheat
it
feels
pretty
smooth
and
is
low
on
the
carbanation
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
marzen
this
one
is
drinkable
d
easy
drinking
smooth
flavors
well
integrated
somewhat
sweet
at
times
not
filling
abv
manageable
for
sure
pours
a
dark
orange
with
many
densely
packed
small
carbonation
trailers
a
tall
head
soon
becomes
but
lace
smell
seems
more
fruity
than
malty
taste
is
sort
of
winelike
as
well
raisinlike
and
alcoholic
but
not
too
bad
other
than
that
a
decent
oktoberfest
backbone
an
ultrasmooth
finish
and
drinkability
like
no
other
style
this
time
of
year
a
solid
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
subtly
creamy
feel
a
very
refreshing
lager
that
could
certainly
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
without
much
difficulty
an
excellent
benchmark
for
the
style
d
a
really
nice
oktoberfest
not
my
favorite
but
still
quite
good
the
lighter
body
and
flavor
make
this
extraordinarily
drinkable
a
12
oz
bottle
is
not
enough
i
could
go
through
a
stein
very
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sweet
overall
a
good
transitionoftheseasons
selection
a
good
malty
oktoberfest
offering
the
alcohol
is
there
somewhat
on
the
finish
but
not
excessively
so
good
malt
to
hop
ratio
drinkability
easy
to
drink
in
the
aspect
its
just
like
a
nice
hopped
lager
with
touch
malt
but
in
aspect
of
what
id
be
looking
to
session
as
an
octoberfest
its
bit
of
a
let
down
again
not
bad
beer
but
just
off
on
what
i
like
in
the
style
loved
this
one
great
drinkability
not
too
sweet
nothing
over
the
top
balance
strength
of
flavor
pleasant
and
distinctive
flavors
good
body
a
really
good
one
very
drinkable
thin
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
md
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
wished
they
offered
it
in
a
liter
mass

d
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable

is
a
very
good

good
beer
but
not
my
fav
in
this
style
so
far
this
years
winner
goes
to
spaten
exceptionaly
drinkable
i
drank
this
beer
without
any
previous
research
at
a
friends
house
it
was
very
nice
and
malty
with
good
brown
toast
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
herbal
bitterness
the
finish
was
dry
and
clean
characteristic
of
a
well
made
lager
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
a
mediumstrength
malty
lager
pours
straw
yellow
with
an
inch
of
foamy
white
head
clean
aromas
of
bread
grains
and
grassy
hops
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
marzen
style
but
this
is
definitely
a
traditional
example
slightly
maltier
than
a
heller
lager
mildly
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
grassy
hop
finish
very
simple
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
tasty
and
certainly
drinkable
i
bet
this
is
great
when
consumed
in
munich
especially
outofdoors
here
its
good
but
mostly
middleoftheroad
just
the
sheer
balance
and
cleanliness
of
this
lager
is
amazing
if
we
had
to
come
up
with
a
benchmark
brand
for
every
style
this
would
be
our
pick
for
ofest
beers
d
i
dont
get
this
beer
funky
herbal
and
just
not
that
good
tasting
the
body
was
the
typical
medium
and
smooth
of
the
style
drinkability
is
very
nice
but
is
probably
better
closer
to
the
source
overall
a
nice
classic
version
of
the
style
d
easy
drinking
i
like
this
one
relatively
drinkable
not
my
cup
of
tea
however
from
a
bottle
with
the
freshness
date
in
the
lower
right
corner
marked
0509l13891s
sampled
postseason
on
march
15
2010
it
pours
a
fetching
amber
color
with
fine
clarity
but
little
head
delicate
carbonation
bubbles
flow
upward
for
several
minutes
before
the
brew
simmers
down
and
stagnates
there
is
an
alluring
german
malty
character
to
this
beer
with
barley
grains
and
sugary
sweetness
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
of
decent
medium
texture
the
flavor
has
a
malty
cleanliness
about
it
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
one
thumbs
up
d
this
style
in
general
is
a
very
drinkable
style
this
beer
in
particular
is
at
the
higher
end
very
good
display
of
munich
malt
that
is
simple
and
classic
nice
complexity
without
throwing
the
palate
around
very
good
example
of
the
style
nice
strong
malt
flavor
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
this
style
nice
creamy
head
that
fades
quickly
but
produces
a
wonderful
crisp
aroma
i
could
drink
this
all
afternoon
sitting
on
the
porch
watching
the
leaves
change
hooray
for
fall
d
this
was
a
great
session
beer
so
nice
and
smooth
i
know
ill
be
adding
it
into
my
fall
rotation
for
sure
this
year
a
nice
amber
color
pour
with
a
two
finger
short
lasting
foamy
off
white
head
medium
carbonaiton
no
apparent
lacing
left
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
toasty
with
slight
grainy
and
caramel
hints
flavor
is
of
taoasted
malt
grain
giving
way
to
a
light
caramel
sweetness
slightly
earthy
some
spicy
hop
flashes
here
and
there
slight
hop
finish
light
body
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
and
reasonably
good
mouthfeel
medium
body
low
carbonation
surprisingly
hop
forward
for
the
style
with
a
strong
malt
character
that
is
again
slightly
roasty
its
also
a
bit
nutty
with
hints
of
spicy
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
this
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
slightly
earthy
hops
that
linger
throughout
pretty
drinkable
but
kind
of
bland
perhaps
i
am
missing
something
here
but
to
me
like
all
oktoberfests
i
have
tried
this
beer
just
seems
like
a
stronger
helles
lager
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
for
me
two
bottles
pour
a
bright
light
brown
beer
into
my
giant
beer
mug
with
room
left
to
support
a
4
inch
light
tan
head
weak
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
this
beer
smells
of
caramel
roasted
nuts
hints
of
nutmeg
and
peppermint
nice
crisp
beer
very
nicely
balanced
beer
good
malty
sweetness
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
bite
very
crisp
and
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
i
will
definitely
have
more
of
this
for
session
drinking
poured
into
a
glass
mug
it
produces
a
small
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
the
appearance
is
light
amber
and
clear
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
with
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ale
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
awhile
and
leaves
splotchy
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
toasted
grain
and
sassafras
with
mild
wintergreen
and
floral
hop
notes
mild
tootsie
roll
sweetness
with
an
herbal
hop
quality
finished
dry
with
mild
metallic
irony
flavors
medium
bodied
and
creamy
a
nice
ofest
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
copper
color
w
a
quickdissipating
12
head
it
has
a
sweet
malty
toast
smell
w
a
real
hops
spice
smell
in
the
background
it
has
the
same
taste
it
is
wellbalanced
w
a
malty
sweetness
on
the
front
end
and
the
hops
bitterness
on
the
backend
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
marzen
that
i
will
look
for
again
overall
although
this
beer
suffers
from
being
transported
thousands
of
kilometres
it
is
still
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
lagers
available
in
australia
a
great
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
great
availability
make
this
an
outstanding
fall
choice
d
i
really
just
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
dont
typically
drink
a
lot
of
marzens
and
octoberfest
lagers
but
i
have
had
a
few
that
i
like
this
is
not
one
of
them
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
wouldnt
complain
it
would
make
for
a
boring
beer
night
however
drinkability
a
very
tasty
brew
indeed
in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
the
sweet
taste
is
very
pronounced
and
the
presentation
is
unbelievable
drinkability
is
good
to
me
like
most
octoberfest
offerrings
it
really
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
when
the
weather
gets
cool
a
nice
crisp
night
and
a
great
octoberfest
this
one
definitely
applies
the
style
in
general
is
drinkable
so
i
rate
it
very
drinkable
with
not
too
much
dryness
or
sweetness
prost
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
the
big
malty
nose
is
exceptionally
clean
if
only
a
tad
too
sweet
a
slightly
acidic
touch
complements
the
bounding
nutty
taste
and
i
find
myself
thinking
of
the
great
ss
nut
brown
theres
a
very
pleasant
flavor
to
this
one
better
than
your
average
oktoberfest
i
would
call
this
comfort
beer
and
i
can
imagine
myself
draining
mugs
of
it
all
day
in
munich
d
light
in
body
with
an
interesting
and
pleasant
flavor
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
marzen
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
light
on
the
gut
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
session
staple
through
the
winter
d
very
easy
to
drink
in
my
very
personal
review
it
might
be
the
german
version
of
corona
extra
i
poured
this
yummy
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
an
nice
oktoberfest
amber
color
as
it
should
be
the
beer
however
did
not
have
a
very
good
head
and
it
quickly
dissipated
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
a
nice
caramel
tasted
slightly
taste
that
i
just
really
like
this
is
one
beer
i
will
continue
to
buy
drinkability
all
day
long
if
i
could
get
it
this
fresh
very
drinkable
and
among
the
top
three
of
german
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
try
to
have
every
year
highly
recomended
if
you
like
rich
toasted
malt
flavors
and
subtle
spicy
hops
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
this
season
i
had
this
about
ten
years
ago
and
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
again
sooner
as
with
most
beer
from
paulaner
this
one
is
solidly
okay
its
got
a
decent
puffy
head
that
releases
a
nice
cloud
of
fruit
and
grain
but
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
tend
to
prefer
oktoberfests
that
are
drier
and
have
more
body
the
alcohol
is
nicely
subdued
which
makes
it
rather
drinkable
but
for
this
style
there
are
many
better
beers
if
you
want
german
try
hackerpschorr
if
you
want
american
try
victory
drinkability
pretty
good
the
beer
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
think
and
the
fruit
flavors
crisp
up
the
beer
to
make
it
surprisingly
refreshing
d
a
very
solid
authentic
drinkable
marzen
not
meant
to
be
the
most
complex
beer
but
rather
this
is
the
one
you
can
drink
loads
of
without
it
becoming
a
hassle
to
drink
notes
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
oktoberfest
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
would
be
a
little
more
head
retention
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
very
well
done
drinkability
a
subpar
offering
for
oktoberfest
i
like
my
marzen
beers
more
malt
based
and
minus
the
residual
hop
to
malt
battle
that
can
sometimes
destroy
a
good
marzen
this
beer
is
way
too
bitter
on
the
tongue
yet
the
smooth
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
makes
up
for
this
not
bad
but
not
great
either
next
autumn
ill
have
to
try
other
imports
or
just
stick
to
american
octoberfests
that
i
know
are
more
fresh
deep
amber
body
finger
and
a
half
semi
rocky
head
fairly
quick
dissipation
malts
dominate
the
nose
nice
balance
of
breadiness
and
sweetness
very
little
hop
smell
big
sweet
malt
domination
of
the
tastebuds
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
backend
smooth
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
certainly
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
the
style
actually
i
prefer
the
draft
version
but
it
is
october
and
living
in
the
beer
wasteland
known
as
the
big
you
got
to
do
what
you
got
to
do
d
a
decent
beer
drinkability
is
very
enjoyable
as
a
preffered
ofest
brew
if
available
33
5
my
first
time
with
paulaner
ofest
but
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
it
was
better
and
fuller
once
upon
a
time
is
this
only
a
problem
with
the
american
export
version
d
a
good
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
but
it
might
be
a
bit
heavier
than
i
usually
want
in
a
marzen
mfd
a
light
body
that
is
coupled
with
ample
carbonation
to
make
a
pseudomedium
the
main
problem
with
the
drinkablility
is
that
the
taste
is
off
from
the
style
the
brew
is
still
good
in
its
own
right
but
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
drinkability
of
this
from
a
masskrug
is
hard
to
match
appearance
was
decent
at
first
but
once
it
fizzled
it
was
gone
looked
like
a
flat
beer
very
malty
with
little
or
no
hop
character
which
is
common
in
this
style
but
something
is
wrong
here
very
average
oktoberfest
beer
maybe
this
was
on
the
shelf
too
long
caramel
toffee
and
maple
syrup
to
go
with
the
nutty
backbone
flavors
are
there
but
its
watery
syrupy
and
needs
bigger
carbonation
to
match
the
heavy
feel
d
a
great
take
on
the
marzen
style
great
time
of
year
this
brew
doesnt
last
long
around
me
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
dimpled
mug
appears
a
hazed
muted
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
off
white
foam
the
foam
lingers
for
a
bit
before
settling
to
a
thin
ring
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
fruits
such
as
green
apples
and
pears
nice
amount
of
caramelized
malt
toasted
buttered
brown
bread
earthy
and
sweet
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
smooth
clean
finish
an
absolute
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
and
blows
away
any
american
offering
i
have
had
this
is
one
of
the
pioneers
that
has
been
around
for
hundreds
of
years
worth
the
price
tag
and
blows
the
competition
away
so
glad
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
some
this
has
inspired
me
to
seek
out
other
german
märzen
offerings
because
so
far
from
what
i
have
tried
the
micros
from
america
dont
even
compare
overall
a
great
oktoberfest
one
of
the
stalwarts
in
the
category
it
is
very
drinkable
i
cant
recall
any
marzen
that
i
have
liked
better
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
d
drinkability
on
this
big
guy
is
great
its
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
and
i
will
definately
be
having
some
more
very
soon
and
very
drinkable
this
brew
is
drinkable
very
much
so
this
is
one
of
the
best
takes
on
this
style
that
i
have
tried
paulaner
is
a
stud
brewery
on
draft
at
rfd
served
in
a
pint
glass
no
head
at
all
ver
low
carbonation
but
i
have
a
theory
that
rfd
is
running
low
on
co2
all
the
beer
there
lately
have
had
no
heads
beer
is
completely
clear
and
orange
in
color
high
malt
in
flavor
full
body
weak
aroma
practically
nothing
definetly
nothing
specific
to
pick
out
kind
of
smells
like
generic
beer
there
are
no
hops
in
the
aroma
or
in
the
flavor
shouldnt
expect
any
so
thats
ok
drinkability
is
fine
just
not
a
very
special
beer
if
i
was
only
at
oktoberfest
superb
in
its
complexity
this
is
most
definitely
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
in
its
homeland
of
munich
its
smoothness
and
rich
mouthfeel
only
serve
to
enrich
its
depth
of
flavor
highly
recommended
d
a
good
clean
sweet
taste
that
you
can
have
more
than
once
definitely
something
you
should
try
a
second
time
to
taste
the
evolution
d
not
bad
not
great
medium
caramelamber
color
poured
into
a
pint
glass
translucent
with
nearly
no
head
the
smell
is
sweet
caramels
and
sugars
taste
is
very
light
with
only
a
slight
caramel
flavor
and
twinge
of
unpleasant
alcohol
aftertastes
highly
carbonated
and
fairly
drinkable
but
the
flavors
arent
really
that
pleasant
and
ive
had
several
oktoberfests
ive
found
a
lot
more
enjoyable
very
smooth
almost
oily
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
sweet
bready
and
a
bit
spicy
the
spiciness
lingers
a
bit
the
body
is
medium
and
average
carbonation
a
very
good
fest
beer
that
goes
down
very
smooth
drinkability
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
the
first
time
i
was
not
impressed
not
sure
why
this
time
around
it
is
much
better
the
combination
of
a
lighter
bodied
brew
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
good
clean
sweet
taste
makes
this
a
marzen
i
could
have
a
few
of
at
once
quite
drinkable
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
of
this
and
sa
octoberfest
i
am
so
partial
to
the
sa
so
it
would
be
interesting
taste
is
pleasantly
creamy
caramel
with
a
touch
of
toasty
malts
some
hops
are
there
for
a
bit
of
balance
especially
on
the
finish
theyre
there
more
for
bitterness
than
flavor
drinkability
is
pretty
ridiculous
on
this
beer
as
a
sixpack
could
disappear
pretty
quick
if
youre
not
careful
a
superb
session
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ofests
i
have
had
poured
into
pint
glass
an
attractive
golden
amber
with
very
little
head
no
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
pretty
clean
mainly
of
malts
taste
is
lightly
roasted
carmel
malts
balanced
with
some
grassy
hop
bitterness
up
front
creamy
maltyness
in
the
middle
has
a
nice
crispness
on
the
finish
accompanied
by
slight
bitterness
of
yeasthop
that
cleans
up
quickly
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
good
and
creamy
a
refreshing
brew
and
highly
drinkable
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
this
really
does
seem
to
bring
a
lot
of
the
good
things
of
this
style
to
the
table
overall
a
pleasant
experience
but
not
something
to
crave
pours
a
nice
copper
gold
nice
aroma
of
malts
bread
and
nuts
what
a
great
oktoberfest
great
caramel
malty
flavor
yet
this
still
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
its
not
too
heavy
and
over
malty
as
some
oktobers
can
be
hits
the
mouth
with
a
nice
warm
malt
feel
and
then
a
little
bite
at
the
end
great
very
drinkible
for
this
style
it
will
now
be
one
of
mt
favorites
for
this
style
long
live
autumn
beers
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
several
other
ofest
beers
that
would
choose
first
im
trying
alot
of
marzens
now
its
that
time
of
the
year
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
i
smell
noble
hops
and
nice
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
some
crisp
noble
hops
and
some
caramel
malts
that
blend
very
nicely
i
like
this
marzen
its
one
of
the
better
of
the
many
that
are
out
there
this
one
is
crisp
sweet
and
smooth
drinkability
is
marvelous
the
perfect
beer
for
a
fall
day
i
could
drink
this
non
stop
until
buddhism
adopts
a
new
discipline
called
mar
zen
super
smooth
sweetness
on
the
front
finishing
with
that
distinctive
crisp
grassy
note
of
noble
hops
straightfoward
but
never
boring
this
guy
boasts
some
great
malt
profiles
with
bready
toasty
malts
and
just
general
goodness
like
any
good
oktoberfest
marzen
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
all
at
the
same
time
like
im
gettin
ready
to
do
in
all
a
great
representation
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
nice
märzen
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
very
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
my
prototypical
marzen
but
i
used
to
enjoy
it
more
than
i
do
now
sometimes
having
an
expanding
palate
sucks
as
it
destroys
old
favorites
even
if
no
longer
a
favorite
of
mine
it
is
still
very
good
nonetheless
prost
d
this
beer
is
the
essence
of
the
oktoberfest
style
a
great
beer
and
perfect
for
the
fall
season
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
i
wait
all
year
for
the
fall
and
winter
beers
to
come
out
even
though
some
are
available
all
year
welcome
this
is
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
decent
octoberfest
that
does
down
smooth
and
is
very
sessionable
its
not
my
favorite
interpreation
of
the
style
but
still
enjoyable
a
dark
amber
brew
with
a
finger
of
white
head
oh
so
pretty
the
aroma
is
nice
and
sweet
with
caramel
malts
the
flavor
has
more
prominent
caramel
and
possible
a
hint
of
citrus
although
it
had
a
bit
of
a
sting
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
enough
to
put
me
off
on
this
beer
its
number
three
or
two
for
my
marzen
picks
drinkability
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
perhaps
it
was
the
specific
bottle
but
i
felt
it
was
very
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
and
almost
felt
like
tea
the
taste
is
very
bready
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
hops
and
that
sharpness
at
the
end
very
lightbodied
i
could
easily
have
a
dozen
of
these
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
is
a
betterknown
festbeir
it
is
remarkably
quaffable
and
subtle
drinkability
easily
downed
i
would
have
another
d
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
tasted
very
good
the
beer
was
very
mild
in
taste
great
had
about
6
at
octoberfest
last
year
and
felt
great
what
a
shame
that
this
is
now
mostly
an
exportonly
style
for
the
germans
poured
a
bright
amber
color
into
a
pint
glass
nice
looking
brew
smelled
biscuity
and
malty
quite
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
mediumlight
flavor
mouthfeel
was
also
right
down
the
middle
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
i
felt
like
a
german
woman
with
a
bustier
should
be
serving
this
to
me
drinkability
was
easy
id
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
quintessential
oktoberfest
beers
and
with
good
reason
it
has
a
sweet
malt
profile
that
finishes
clean
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
was
pretty
old
produced
on
0608
so
i
may
be
inclined
to
take
another
stab
at
this
one
with
a
fresher
bottle
not
too
bad
for
how
old
it
is
though
i
can
see
why
this
is
supposedly
the
number
one
oktoberfest
beer
in
the
world
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
copper
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smelled
slightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
a
metallic
smell
the
taste
was
surprising
with
an
initial
maltiness
followed
by
a
strong
peachy
plumlike
taste
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
that
ive
had
for
this
style
very
smooth
and
refreshing
its
a
good
one
but
ill
put
my
efforts
to
trying
other
beers
before
having
this
one
again
pours

colored

strong
a

lovely

gift
it
was
a
minikeg
of

perhaps
a
bit
offseason
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
a

with

bubbles
the
fluffy
head
shrinks
down
soon
leaving
nice
lace
throughout
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
malt
with
citruslemon
hop
the
flavor
is
a
nutty
malt
with
hints
of
cashew
and
lemon
edging
a
good
basic
drinkable
beer
without
much
complexity
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
german
oktoberfest
ontap
at
a
responsible
beer
bar
that
takes
care
of
its
lines
very
important
for
european
lagers
bottled
versions
of
this
style
are
easily
corrupted
has
a
pretty
good
relaxing
flavor
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
not
my
taste
in
beers
but
either
way
this
is
a
good
beer

nice
beer
enjoyed
each
sip
just
a
bit
overpriced
but
it
is
an
import
for
me
oe
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
better
than
most
pumpkin
flavored
beers
i
have
had
nothing
special
especially
considering
the
metallic
taste
i
had
this
back
in
nov
so
it
should
have
been
in
date
something
was
off
though
drinkability
is
very
good
and
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
the
12
pack
and
it
was
only
a
buck
a
bottle
d
very
good
beer
the
none
seasonal
aspect
hurts
in
my
opinion
but
still

this
beer
was
a
very
strong
malty
beer
easily
the
best
oktoberfest
i
have
had
to
date
md
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
easily
consumed
just
nothing
too
special
about
it
drinkability
alright
not
spectacular
more
of
a
staple
beer
than
something
fantastic
not
worth
seeking
out
easy
to
throw
back
but
not
a
session
beer
if
that
makes
sense
drinkablity
this
is
another
good
oktoberfest
it
seemed
to
depart
from
what
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
because
of
the
dryness
an
a
pronounced
yet
subtle
hop
presence
d
good
poured
this
copperish
red
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
that
appeared
with
it
presented
itself
nicely
and
then
decipated
to
a
lingerance
the
aroma
off
the
beer
is
one
you
expect
with
a
seasonal
beer
like
this
while
the
taste
was
of
the
seasonal
expectation
it
also
went
back
to
the
english
stylization
that
paulaners
are
known
for
i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
during
a
week
in
telluride
great
amber
color
small
head
toasty
malt
aroma
with
some
nuts
and
pepper
hops
malty
monster
with
a
crisp
finish
never
had
a
sour
one
but
also
never
tried
it
out
of
a
bottle
ill
get
this
again
when
i
go
back
pours
marzen
amber
smells
very
malty
weak
watery
palate
some
malty
caramel
taste
but
overly
very
weak
disappointing
there
are
some
far
better
oktoberfestmarzens
out
there
to
taste
this
unfortunately
falls
short
id
recommend
hackerpschorr
over
this
paulaner
brew
overall
this
is
also
another
good
oktoberfest
the
finish
is
nice
making
you
quench
for
more
a
decent
marzen
but
nothing
too
special
this
was
decent
with
some
good
flavors
but
i
like
the
hop
profiles
in
my
ofests
to
take
a
back
seat
and
compliment
the
primary
flavors
instead
of
the
other
way
around
still
i
liked
the
sharpness
in
the
body
and
the
drinkibility
was
good
there
are
just
probably
a
couple
of
imports
that
i
would
go
to
first
before
this
though
do
one
of
the
better
german
festbiers
ive
had
this
year
both
on
draft
and
in
the
bottle
i
think
the
bready
sweetness
would
border
on
cloying
if
i
tried
to
drink
this
all
day
under
a
tent
but
id
raise
a
few
litres
of
this
every
fall
to
celebrate
the
season
md
excellent
mouthfeel
just
a
simple
beer
that
delivers
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
stale
this
beer
tastes
old
and
a
bit
skunked
but
beyond
that
stale
flavor
i
dont
find
much
of
interest
would
like
to
try
one
that
is
confirmed
fresh
if
it
is
nota
vast
improvement
i
will
continue
to
avoid
this
brew
a
little
watery
but
smooth
nonetheless
a
pretty
good
marzen
but
ive
had
better
bottle
smooth
amber
beer
with
a
good
finish
decent
but
id
love
to
get
a
fresher
try
with
it
on
tap
light
spices
and
biscuit
flavors
some
light
fruit
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
easygoing
and
wellcrafted
a
typical
marzen
light
spices
and
full
flavored
ive
really
taking
a
liking
to
marzen
style
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
wonderful
clear
medium
amber
color
it
had
a
hefty
2
in
head
with
good
lacing
semisweet
aroma
of
baked
bread
a
nice
crisp
clean
tasting
beer
but
still
very
flavorful
a
strong
malt
taste
with
only
a
hint
of
hop
to
give
the
beer
balance
i
could
drink
this
almost
anytime
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
at
the
davis
coop
when
it
arrived
in
town
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
with
short
fleeting
head
that
recedes
to
just
a
white
ring
around
the
top
green
apple
and
mild
sweet
malt
odor
some
cornlike
odor
reminds
be
oddly
of
mgd
which
is
weird
taste
is
a
mild
slightly
sweet
maltiness
spicy
hops
mingle
with
the
sweetness
and
create
a
mild
applelike
flavor
that
lingers
a
long
time
alcohol
becomes
obvious
but
complements
the
flavor
medium
bodied
drinks
well
and
appropriate
for
the
season
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
an
amber
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
smells
faintly
of
sweet
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
slight
bit
of
grain
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
much
rather
have
something
else
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
certainly
sessionable
but
not
incredibly
interesting
the
beer
is
great
but
i
was
expecting
a
classic
oktoberfest
taste
profile
a
good
okotberfest
should
feature
a
big
malt
foundation
but
it
should
also
be
tempered
by
a
decent
dose
of
noble
hobs
to
balance
things
out
as
stated
earlier
this
would
be
a
great
bock
its
a
good
drinkable
marzen
i
think
there
is
room
for
improvement
yet
there
are
some
very
nice
qualities
that
need
to
be
kept
i
could
sit
back
and
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
when
i
think
oktoberfest
i
think
paulaner
a
true
classic
i
could
have
two
or
so
and
then
i
would
go
looking
for
something
else
the
taste
is
similar
plummy
and
bready
with
caramel
stewed
dried
fruit
unpasteurised
apple
juice
a
light
leafypiney
bitterness
that
just
dominates
the
finish
which
has
elements
of
leaves
pine
fruit
bread
and
grain
its
very
smooth
a
bit
lively
if
somewhatflat
in
feel
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
pretty
light
mouthfeel
definitely
feels
more
like
a
lager
than
some
of
the
american
beers
in
this
style
finishes
slightly
sticky
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
no
problem
d
i
really
do
not
like
marzen
style
beers
thits
all
bjcp
guidelines
and
if
i
judged
would
probably
be
a
contestant
for
best
in
show
drinkability
is
good
this
is
damn
tasty
as
much
as
i
love
the
full
taste
several
liters
of
this
may
be
a
challenge
but
thats
not
how
i
drink
beer
and
for
my
pick
this
is
a
good
one
really
much
better
in
this
bottle
size
for
whatever
reason
it
tastes
particularly
fresh
and
full
of
life
after
the
flacid
baron
oktoberfest
i
just
had
in
fact
i
had
to
go
back
and
dial
down
some
of
those
scores
in
contrast
d
very
easy
drinkin
light
and
smooth
simple
in
a
very
good
way
i
could
and
will
enjoy
a
few
of
these
well
done
this
one
pours
a
pretty
golden
dark
amber
not
too
much
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
spicy
not
strong
but
promising
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
and
has
a
nice
nutty
undertone
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
somewhat
tingly
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
defines
fall
to
me
from
the
bottle
to
the
presentation
in
the
glass
to
the
taste
solid
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
it
is
a
nice
coppery
color
a
light
head
the
aroma
is
nice
roasty
malt
the
flavor
is
a
great
cereally
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
a
bitter
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
great
drinkability
factor
i
could
sit
and
put
down
a
case
i
love
oktoberfests
overall
this
was
enjoyable
would
recommend
i
find
this
a
bit
more
interesting
than
many
of
the
sweet
sticky
octoberfest
beers
that
are
out
today
pretty
drinkable
a
solid
ofest
d
ok
but
not
great
i
have
had
a
lot
of
oktoberfest
beers
i
would
rather
have
d
an
excellent
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
made
this
beer
and
excellent
drinking
beer
definitely
a
very
nice
example
of
an
oktoberfest
4
5
d
of
all
the
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
and
penn
brewerys
are
my
favorites
this
is
very
good
and
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
a
very
pleasent
and
easy
to
drink
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
orange
with
medium
white
head
falling
somewhat
quickly
fairly
low
carbonation
good
clean
smell
of
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
light
toasted
malt
and
some
grain
taste
is
basically
the
same
not
overly
sweet
and
pretty
solid
a
refreshing
touch
of
hops
leave
a
lightly
crisp
finish
just
a
tad
watered
down
a
little
thin
to
me
still
its
pretty
smooth
overall
its
a
good
drinkable
brew
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
drinkability
very
high
on
this
category
crisp
great
taste
and
goes
down
great
probably
the
best
of
the
style
so
far
yes
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
ah
i
love
the
original
oktoberfests
i
wish
id
had
this
earlier
in
the
season
because
these
put
everything
in
perspective
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
that
finish
with
light
roasted
flavors
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
fairly
clean
and
theres
nothing
remotely
off
basically
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
id
drink
a
steinfull
anytime
the
taste
is
quite
crisp
but
not
overly
so
there
is
lots
of
caramel
malts
some
spices
and
herbal
hop
bite
but
not
overly
so
there
is
more
carbonation
in
this
marzen
than
you
will
find
in
most
others
the
beer
is
definitely
tilted
towards
the
crisp
rather
than
the
creamy
end
of
the
continuum
but
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
creaminess
on
the
tongue
for
it
isnt
entirely
crispy
either
there
is
a
slightly
husky
graininess
there
is
a
herbal
tea
like
hop
character
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
biting
but
much
milder
than
some
other
octoberfests
you
will
find
the
key
principle
in
this
beer
is
balance
the
parts
are
well
balanced
and
more
so
than
most
other
marzens
you
will
find
and
that
makes
this
one
a
cut
above
the
pack
lchaim
a
dark
copper
body
with
hints
of
ruby
and
auburn
great
tan
head
and
good
retention
with
minor
lacings
a
light
malt
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
any
spices
or
hops
a
smooth
almost
creamy
mediumbodied
beer
that
has
a
not
overpowering
sweet
malt
taste
of
caramel
and
mixes
it
with
some
spices
in
the
background
passes
over
pleasantly
and
has
a
little
kick
on
the
backend
hops
lead
to
a
floral
semiearthy
taste
but
do
not
overpower
the
beer
only
give
it
a
dry
backbite
a
great
oktoberfest
to
be
had
at
any
time
good
flavor
light
body
and
low
abv
makes
this
go
down
quickly
and
often
d
really
enjoyed
this
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
smooth
going
down
warm
sweet
and
toasty
perfect
for
the
chilly
fall
evening
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
perfect
marzen
style
copper
with
a
head
the
quickly
dissipates
to
rim
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
on
this
beer
malts
clove
and
gentle
spiciness
the
taste
sweet
malt
followed
by
interesting
cloves
spiciness
and
a
black
tea
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
slightly
viscous
a
good
offering
and
would
be
a
quick
drinkable
festival
beer
it
is
a
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
in
a
1
litre
mug
any
day
the
best
of
the
german
octoberfests
that
i
tried
this
is
also
the
only
one
i
would
probably
even
buy
again
compared
to
hackerpschorr
and
hofbrau
definitely
has
a
nice
european
taste
to
it
and
some
of
the
falls
pices
can
be
detected
i
thought
it
could
improve
a
lot
in
the
body
as
it
was
way
too
thin
for
my
liking
i
still
like
the
american
versions
better
but
this
was
a
solid
ofest
d
paulaner
has
been
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
this
was
very
easy
to
take
down
and
allows
for
easy
drinking
with
its
5
8
abv
definitely
recommended
pours
clear
medium
to
dark
amber
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
thins
to
barely
a
film
malty
aroma
that
is
pleasantly
musty
with
maybe
a
little
spice
good
sweet
to
bready
malty
if
with
a
relatively
long
lived
caramel
and
malt
aftertaste
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
medium
to
fulll
bodied
with
crisp
carbonated
finish
overall
a
good
beer
of
which
i
tend
to
buy
at
least
one
six
pack
each
october
or
late
september
overall
simply
stated
its
phenomenal
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brews
highly
recommended
to
all
d
absolutely
smooth
and
refreshing
marzen
are
growing
on
me
d
not
bad
i
have
enjoyed
this
one
for
the
past
couple
of
years
notes
i
am
finding
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
any
oktoberfestmarzen
but
this
is
as
good
as
any
that
i
have
sampled
i
will
not
seek
this
beer
out
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
very
very
drinkable
and
im
liking
this
significantly
easily
quaffable
a
solid
oktoberfest
beer
you
wont
be
wowed
but
still
enjoyable
good
crisp
carbonation
keeps
this
complex
lager
light
on
the
mouth
nice
taste
fairly
easy
drinking
poured
from
brown
bottle
to
a
cold
mug
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
minimal
cream
colored
head
smell
left
me
wanting
was
very
weak
i
expected
alot
more
here
but
what
it
has
is
melow
roasted
malt
aroma
tasted
watery
for
the
style
with
sweet
roast
malts
and
some
hop
flavor
but
rather
bland
for
an
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
drinks
smooth
and
would
be
good
for
a
session
and
is
a
fine
beer
but
is
not
what
i
had
hoped
on
the
light
side
of
mediumbodied
with
great
carbonation
and
feel
paulaners
oktoberfest
is
exceptionally
drinkable
if
lacking
the
maltload
to
crack
the
top
echelon
of
the
style
definitely
one
of
the
best
octoberfests
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
the
spaten
version
this
one
is
really
close
or
better
might
be
picking
up
a
minikeg
of
this
soon
d
extremely
high
this
is
one
helluva
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
for
lengthyy
periods
of
time
a
very
good
oktoberfest
offering
mfd
a
very
good
example
of
oktoberfest
beer
boy
do
i
love
the
fall
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
going
to
pour
another
one
now
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
overall
too
light
and
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
feels
too
much
like
water
and
along
with
the
overall
weak
flavorwhen
compared
to
othersit
just
seems
a
bit
weak
nice
aftertaste
here
but
as
far
as
the
whole
experience
and
the
body
flavor
included
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
be
lacking
im
just
not
a
fan
great
to
try
and
a
good
offering
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
lacking
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
glad
to
try
it
but
ill
be
picking
up
many
of
the
other
ofests
and
those
are
the
ones
ive
already
tried
not
to
mention
the
drive
to
pick
up
ofests
ive
not
tried
before
i
pick
this
one
up
again
d
excellent
the
second
one
tastes
better
than
the
first
and
the
third
even
better
great
abv
wonderful
sessionable
beer
for
a
crisp
fall
day
d
very
drinkable
beer
a
decent
festbier
that
i
find
a
bit
too
carbonatedinitially
and
a
bit
too
cloaking
in
style
but
is
nonetheless
a
nice
oktoberfest
brew
this
is
an
old
standard
nothing
outstanding
mindblowingrevolutionary
or
extreme
double
whatever
here
just
enjoy
for
what
it
isa
damn
fine
bier
prost
very
drinkable
a
nice
mild
unoffensive
oktoberfest
especially
for
an
ameican
consumer
my
guess
is
germans
and
real
oktoberfest
fans
dont
like
this
stuff
but
i
think
its
fine
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
the
more
you
drink
the
better
it
tastes
d
very
sweet
and
goes
down
very
easily
d
very
drinkable
like
most
oktoberfests
good
body
and
carbonation
ever
so
drinkable
this
is
just
so
clean
and
delicious
this
seems
to
be
near
the
top
for
me
mdi
love
both
not
too
many
bubbles
to
get
in
the
way
of
that
mulled
cider
warming
feel
just
awesome
for
the
onset
of
autumn
seems
almost
a
crime
not
to
have
some
mustard
and
sausage
to
accompany
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
wellmade
for
sure
taste
mouthfeel
crisp
and
smooth
very
malty
grainy
sweetness
toasted
bread
and
nuts
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
faintly
mineralmetallic
great
mouthfeel
mediumlight
in
body
and
carbonation
not
so
heavy
or
fizzy
that
its
difficult
to
drink
a
liter
the
finish
is
moderately
drying
and
only
faintly
hoppy
this
is
pretty
straightforward
stuff
but
very
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
and
of
course
an
original
d
highly
sessionable
as
are
most
of
the
style
but
there
was
something
about
the
toastedroasted
quality
and
the
slight
metallic
flavor
that
dropped
this
half
a
point
d
i
enjoyed
aspects
of
it
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
big
six
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
about
it
d
solid
brew
more
substantial
than
refreshing
and
malty
rather
than
hoppy
d
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
from
my
early
days
of
good
beer
appreciation
great
session
beer
that
im
glad
i
returned
to
a
bit
dryer
than
expected
with
a
tasty
but
not
overly
strong
malt
body
and
medium
hop
balance
carbonation
is
about
right
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
finish
and
clean
aftertaste
maybe
a
little
yeasty
but
this
is
avery
solid
german
marzen
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
for
this
style
and
drinkability
is
good
a
few
pitchers
of
this
with
friends
would
be
nice
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
malty
tone
with
elements
of
biscuit
and
bread
like
flavor
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
mouth
feel
is
spicy
with
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
that
provides
an
excellent
example
of
the
german
brewing
tradition
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
and
nuts
soft
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
delivers
more
mellow
toffee
and
nuts
flavor
with
a
kind
of
crystal
malty
sweetness
just
barely
balanced
by
soft
hopping
in
the
back
ground
smooth
offdry
finish
calls
for
more
until
this
morning
i
have
a
headache
a
beer
worth
sharing
with
friends
another
plus
for
this
beer
is
that
it
comes
in
a
minibaby
keg
sidebyside
with
the
sam
adams
oktoberfest
and
this
beer
made
it
no
contest
and
i
really
like
the
sam
adams
version
i
mean
it
just
absolutely
blew
it
away
in
mouthfeel
smell
flavor
malt
everything
it
was
a
suprise
to
say
the
least
so
ill
be
doing
it
with
the
spaten
offering
too
hey
what
can
i
say
its
that
time
of
the
year
pours
a
really
nice
dark
copper
with
slight
head
low
retention
with
medium
lacing
i
definitely
enjoy
the
color
on
this
one
for
being
as
allout
oktoberfesty
as
i
want
great
aroma
as
well
grainy
sort
of
a
dough
in
smell
with
sweetness
light
but
super
malty
not
too
strong
in
any
particular
malt
smells
of
fall
and
freshly
raked
leaves
i
think
i
get
a
little
alcohol
in
the
taste
5
8
oh
noticeable
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
blends
well
with
the
malt
a
little
floralrosy
as
it
warms
up
having
had
this
i
want
to
go
back
and
try
out
the
hackerpschorr
once
more
to
really
try
to
nail
what
imo
the
best
oktoberfest
is
the
alcohol
and
hops
make
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
other
ones
ive
had
but
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
all
4s
d
an
excellent
raking
leaves
weather
beer
this
was
definately
worth
a
try
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
a
german
oktoberfest
beer
the
body
is
light
overall
a
crisp
finish
but
lacks
the
depth
for
an
ofest
carbonation
is
light
but
good
overall
this
to
me
is
not
a
very
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
where
is
the
vienna
and
munich
some
off
brewing
notes
skunk
minerally
yeasty
notes
pours
a
very
nice
looking
clear
deep
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
very
malty
and
rich
with
some
light
straw
taste
follows
with
very
good
lagery
grain
and
nice
rich
malty
flavor
with
going
overboard
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
hints
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
drinkability
is
very
good
here
especially
considering
the
rich
maltiness
in
the
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
brew
and
one
i
will
be
sure
to
revisit
quite
tastey
and
very
drinkable
perfect
for
the
season
d
again
i
will
say
it
the
key
for
these
beers
is
to
get
them
fresh
this
is
a
nice
fresh
bottle
and
it
is
enjoyable
in
a
month
or
two
they
will
loose
quite
a
bit
check
the
bottle
dates
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
characteristics
that
would
fatigue
the
palate
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
it
really
gets
me
into
the
mood
for
the
season
something
i
would
recommend
d
a
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
d
a
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
d
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beer
for
the
season
i
like
the
weihenstephaner
festbier
version
a
little
better
for
its
sharpness
but
this
stands
up
pretty
well
for
the
style
d
finish
and
rich
taste
makes
it
a
really
nice
beer
to
keep
drinking
without
abv
putting
on
the
hurt
drinkability
honestly
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
another
sixer
sometime
soon
i
like
german
beers
especially
paulaners
salvator
but
this
was
not
something
i
would
go
after
all
too
often
even
during
the
autumn
season
i
was
hoping
to
love
this
beer
but
instead
i
found
it
a
little
above
average
tastes
rich
and
malty
with
a
creamy
presence
and
smooth
finish
fairly
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
carbonation
for
an
oktoberfest
this
one
is
a
classic
and
remains
so
date
on
the
bottle
says
0408
but
whether
this
is
a
best
buy
date
or
a
bottled
date
i
dont
know
the
guy
selling
it
said
they
just
got
a
shipment
in
so
i
hope
it
is
a
bottled
on
date
this
beer
pours
a
deep
caramel
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
toffee
raisins
and
a
bit
or
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
really
dominating
the
flavor
profile
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
me
also
a
tad
astringent
at
the
tail
while
no
the
best
ofest
im
thinking
about
you
ayinger
ofest
ive
had
its
still
a
great
beer
to
imbibe
on
a
nice
cool
evening
d
i
think
its
still
to
hot
out
to
be
enjoying
octoberfest
quite
yet
but
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
after
liking
the
other
beers
from
paulaner
a
solid
marzen
mouthfeel
was
decent
if
a
bit
thin
this
was
a
pure
treat
and
something
to
delve
more
into
in
the
future
prime
example
of
great
german
beer
and
the
oktoberfest
marzen
style
d
no
complaints
m
d
assertive
carbonation
crisp
with
a
fairly
nice
finishlingering
flavour
could
be
a
touch
lighter
to
be
a
fantastic
session
brew
but
worth
the
try
and
a
potential
staple
of
the
season
clear
golden
orange
color
with
thin
tan
head
smellled
malty
and
slightly
citrusy
smokey
aroma
in
mouth
then
moves
to
spices
and
caramel
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
malt
flavor
caught
up
with
me
at
the
end
and
started
to
overpower
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
a
lot
ill
look
for
it
once
more
during
the
oktoberfest
season
try
it
recommended
the
thin
head
goes
fast
to
leave
a
thin
ring
of
foam
has
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
body
aroma
is
of
average
strength
but
nice
and
very
malty
taste
is
good
but
unexciting
but
i
might
be
drinking
it
too
cold
mildly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bite
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
also
some
tiny
bit
of
spice
and
toast
also
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
but
otherwise
solid
mouthfeel
overall
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
and
good
but
nothing
special
dthis
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brews
and
ill
have
more
and
more
as
the
time
nears
this
is
a
lighter
oktoberfest
that
is
more
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
than
others
dnice
beer
with
decent
flavor
could
see
having
several
of
these
as
starter
beers
this
is
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
on
any
day
any
time
d
excellent
example
of
what
an
oktoberfestmarzen
should
be
great
beer
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
representations
i
have
had
great
session
beer
too
a
good
staple
in
beer
drinking
recommended
the
aroma
was
bready
malts
and
lemon
i
tasted
the
grain
like
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
it
was
very
crisp
and
clean
for
a
malt
dominated
brew
overall
it
was
a
excellent
octoberfest
d
the
slightly
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
makes
you
want
to
come
back
quickly
for
another
sip
the
low
carbonation
assists
in
making
it
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
much
more
smoothly
than
most
oktoberfests
i
have
had
md
dry
and
light
crisp
finish
easy
to
drink
drinkability
easy
drinking
sessionable
d
would
be
great
anyday
truly
one
of
the
classic
oktoberfests
this
beer
is
absurdly
easy
to
drink
its
smooth
and
tasty
light
but
flavorful
drinkability
is
good
but
after
a
few
i
would
want
to
switch
to
something
else
not
too
bad
of
an
oktoberfest
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
nice
marzen
ill
have
to
look
for
this
one
this
fall
but
this
bottle
from
07
has
held
up
well
pours
amber
with
a
nice
clarity
with
a
healthy
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
lager
yeast
tang
lots
of
caramel
aromas
taste
is
similar
very
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
there
is
a
fresh
graininess
that
keeps
everything
in
balance
smooth
and
slightly
grainy
mouthfeel
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
but
its
a
bit
utilitarian
especially
19
99
a
great
find
drinkability
it
is
a
great
beer
that
it
wonderful
to
drink
pours
a
reddishorange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
drops
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
light
pleasant
malt
aroma
taste
is
malty
with
a
faint
nuttiness
theres
a
very
light
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
classic
example
of
the
style
one
and
onehalf
fingers
of
offwhite
froth
top
an
orangebrown
body
impressive
on
the
whole
the
nose
emits
plenty
of
malt
and
fruit
i
like
the
tastean
admixture
of
toffee
mild
spice
and
fruit
primarily
grapes
and
apples
smooth
with
a
modest
bite
of
bitterness
this
is
easy
to
enjoy
and
return
to
delicious
there
is
a
good
malty
flavor
under
the
oxidation
but
the
hop
character
might
be
a
tad
too
much
for
the
style
here
it
is
february
and
im
still
getting
to
some
oktoberfests
but
its
always
a
good
time
for
one
of
my
favorite
goto
styles
when
im
feeling
a
bit
undecided
pours
a
pale
amber
into
a
pint
glass
the
slight
head
fades
quickly
off
an
aggressive
pour
if
you
blink
youll
miss
it
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
faint
esters
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
department
but
it
works
just
fine
in
this
beer
not
everything
has
to
be
complex
it
has
a
certain
openness
to
it
that
is
surrounded
by
a
thin
veil
of
hops
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
i
see
myself
in
germany
drinking
a
few
of
these
while
enjoying
the
company
of
a
beautiful
blond
fraulein
dim
not
blown
away
but
its
a
nice
classic
brew
thats
a
decent
value
it
is
refreshing
and
i
expect
it
would
pair
with
great
versatility
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
pours
a
deep
amber
with
medium
head
smell
is
light
malty
nothing
stands
out
but
its
still
pleasant
medium
bitterness
slightly
sweet
feel
is
smooth
but
nothing
really
stands
out
not
too
bad
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
a
really
tasty
and
well
done
example
of
the
style
not
too
big
in
alcohol
feel
or
caramel
flavors
medium
body
with
a
rich
german
malt
flavor
there
is
a
little
bit
of
noble
hop
bitterness
nice
oktoberfest
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
with
spicy
food
this
one
was
fairly
clear
and
a
deep
amber
colour
topped
by
a
beige
cap
the
head
retention
was
decent
and
it
showed
some
good
stickage
with
clumpy
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
malty
sweet
caramel
and
grain
dominating
low
bitterness
sweet
and
malty
flavour
with
a
very
mild
hop
presence
there
was
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
too
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
just
on
the
low
side
and
a
decent
texture
overall
maybe
just
a
little
slick
on
the
palate
pretty
decent
and
very
malty
it
just
seemed
like
it
lacked
a
bit
of
something
to
hold
it
all
together
drinkability
one
of
my
2
favorite
styles
of
beer
i
have
to
give
this
on
high
marks
a
staple
for
my
beer
fridge
mainly
due
to
my
love
of
marzens
and
its
availability
at
my
local
beer
store
this
is
actually
my
first
oktoberfest
beer
i
bought
it
from
a
netherlands
seller
this
beer
pours
out
with
a
more
than
3
finger
thick
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
one
finger
creamy
head
with
nice
clinging
action
and
finally
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
covering
the
golden
seethrough
liquid
below
nice
bubbling
action
in
the
tall
slender
erdinger
glass
enhances
the
appearance
of
this
beer
smell
was
not
really
strong
but
i
am
picking
up
malts
and
light
hints
of
fresh
fruits
and
citrus
the
taste
starts
off
with
slight
sour
note
on
the
palates
with
a
pleasing
malt
profile
subtle
fruitiness
and
citrus
also
show
up
soon
after
the
taste
was
slightly
bland
though
refreshing
like
the
kristallweizens
though
i
prefer
this
one
slightly
to
the
kristals
but
of
course
not
as
much
as
the
hefeweizens
of
course
the
finish
was
a
little
dry
with
a
nice
malty
after
taste
where
the
wheat
becomes
more
pronounced
before
a
typically
grapy
citrus
conclusion
i
am
getting
malt
aromas
on
the
nose
as
well
throughout
the
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
between
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
more
of
watery
kind
of
texture
and
good
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
slightly
dry
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
clear
amber
with
a
off
white
head
nose
of
light
fruit
light
nuttiness
and
malty

taste
of
light
fruit
light
nuttiness
and
roasted
malt
body
is
light
to
medium
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
tasty
a
sixpack
is
not
enough
so
shop
for
more
hoist
the
tankards
its
oktoberfest
drinkable
but
not
a
stand
out
pours
a
clear
orangegold
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
but
smooth
at
first
there
seemed
to
be
almost
a
perfume
touch
goes
down
very
smooth
which
ups
the
drinkability
feel
is
thick
with
character
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
too
good
to
try
but
not
spectacular
enough
to
warrant
a
repeat
performance
i
say
not
a
bad
beer
from
paulaner
overall
glad
to
see
a
light
and
flavorful
marzen
on
the
market
i
would
recommend
this
and
would
also
drink
it
again
pretty
impressed
for
a
beer
style
that
i
am
not
usually
very
into
if
you
like
this
styleor
even
if
you
dontyou
deserve
to
give
this
one
a
try
d
very
drinkable
with
no
overpowering
but
present
flavors
and
a
decent
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
be
pretty
satisfied
most
notably
the
aftertaste
is
distinctly
that
of
pepto
bismal
sounds
strange
but
i
challenge
anyone
whose
tasted
both
to
tell
me
otherwise
still
despite
the
medicinal
afertaste
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
for
its
intended
purpose
which
is
being
served
in
large
portions
without
being
a
crap
beer
probably
ideal
to
be
served
out
of
a
traditional
oktoberfest
boot
smooth
and
a
bit
heavier
due
to
lower
relative
carbonation
not
as
clean
of
a
finish
as
expected
rather
heavy
and
a
bit
syrupy
very
nice
overall
decently
balanced
and
a
good
accompaniment
to
food
edit
10172009
had
some
on
tap
and
found
it
much
better
than
in
bottles
like
a
bready
nutty
explosion
of
munich
in
my
mouth
prob
my
fav
of
the
season
flavor
follows
suit
deadon
oktoberfest
with
moderately
chewy
amber
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
leafy
hops
leans
a
bit
more
towards
malt
than
spatens
offering
yet
is
fairly
similar
in
other
regards
classic
example
of
the
style
adequately
malty
mouthfeel
without
being
thick
highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
good
standarf
for
the
style
it
was
brewer
0607
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
brewery
in
germany
bottom
line
its
a
paulaner
oktoberfest
what
are
you
doing
reading
these
reviews
just
drink
one
already
p
last
ofest
in
the
fridge
for
this
year
very
fizzy
when
poured
into
the
glass
reddishorange
hue
with
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
all
malts
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
all
malts
caramel
nuts
and
sweet
twang
that
i
cant
place
very
nice
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
glad
this
now
available
yearround
d
very
drinkable
quite
tasty
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
fresh
malt
and
soft
unobtrusive
aroma
in
a
willibecker
nice
oneinch
head
on
an
orange
body
basically
the
picture
i
imagine
when
ordering
an
octoberfest
soft
palate
with
a
classic
crispness
a
slightly
nutty
malt
taste
substantial
body
and
a
strong
presence
a
bit
sweet
too
the
sweetness
and
strength
are
plusses
versatile
and
accessible
but
with
enough
character
not
to
be
derivative
clear
amber
orange
in
color
topped
off
by
the
perfect
sized
head
thin
rings
of
lacing
stick
to
the
glass
aroma
suggests
of
bready
malts
pumpkins
husk
and
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
a
faint
fume
of
alcohol
stable
mouthfeel
its
very
easy
to
sit
back
and
drink
this
without
any
monster
flavors
interrupting
while
having
enough
to
have
you
going
back
for
more
this
years
review
of
the
oktoberfest
seemed
slightly
better
the
smell
was
very
raisin
prune
molasses
taste
is
good
caramel
malt
better
than
i
remebered
grab
this
stuff
if
you
can
find
it
i
got
it
locally
for
us32
per
case
but
didnt
even
check
the
place
across
town
that
usually
has
lower
prices
the
taste
was
very
malty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bite
at
the
end
and
was
a
great
example
of
an
octorberfest
bier
and
went
excellently
with
the
cuisine
beautiful
amber
colors
of
the
5
different
ofests
ive
tried
this
year
i
think
this
one
is
my
favorite
6
if
you
include
sam
adams
that
i
had
a
couple
years
ago
this
was
very
smooth
crisp
and
clean
and
a
tad
thin
which
i
personally
liked
it
was
caramelmalty
typical
of
the
style
but
not
too
caramellysweet
just
enough
to
make
it
nice
and
finish
very
clean
i
recommend
this
one
over
many
ofests
wish
i
had
more
but
maybe
next
year
im
sure
this
one
would
be
great
with
all
the
delicious
german
grub
but
i
drank
it
by
its
lonesome
very
nice
ofest
if
you
want
to
know
the
other
4
they
are
spaten
stegmaier
from
pa
victory
fest
bier
and
harpoon
i
think
paulaner
takes
the
cake
over
these
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
drinkability
is
very
very
high
a
great
quaffer
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
oktoberfest
paulaner
is
a
traditional
brewery
at
the
oktoberfest
munich
and
its
plain
to
see
why
theyve
maintained
that
place
theyre
no
slouches
when
it
comes
to
the
marzen
style
another
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
d
easy
beer
to
drink
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
very
balanced
as
people
have
mentioned
before
oktoberfests
are
meant
to
be
session
beers
and
this
would
do
very
well
for
an
afternoon
or
evening
of
drinking
i
look
forward
to
getting
this
beer
again
d
this
is
the
best
oktoberfestmarzen
ive
had
to
date
looks
like
itll
become
a
fall
staple
in
my
fridge
overall
a
decent
enough
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
well
worth
a
try
decent
octoberfest
on
sale
at
bevmo
have
one
in
your
hand
constantly
and
served
cold
would
probably
be
the
best
i
had
actually
expected
this
to
be
better
then
it
was
but
it
merely
turned
out
to
be
average
it
was
not
terrible
by
any
means
just
again
i
expected
a
tad
bit
more
if
it
is
there
you
could
do
worse
though
maybe
the
5point
assessment
brings
this
beer
down
in
my
mind
a
little
it
is
still
one
of
the
top
märzens
of
the
season
i
look
forward
to
having
more
next
year
if
i
dont
buy
more
this
year
taste
is
predominantly
malt
with
light
straw
and
some
biscuit
notes
bitterness
is
medium
and
the
beer
shows
some
hoppiness
the
beer
has
something
unfresh
a
funny
aftertaste
and
a
sharp
bitterness
combined
with
an
unexpected
warming
alcoholic
sensation
aftertaste
is
also
dry
a
somewhat
unbalanced
beer
at
first
but
after
05
liters
of
this
stuff
i
have
gotten
used
to
it
and
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
after
all
mouthfeel
holds
up
and
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
great
way
to
get
a
macro
drinker
to
start
looking
for
more
in
a
beer
without
overwhelming
himher
pours
a
beautiful
amber
makes
me
think
autumn
is
right
around
the
corner
really
dont
have
much
experience
with
german
brewed
marzenoktoberfests
but
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
then
any
domestic
okotoberfests
that
i
have
ever
had
nice
malt
and
some
sweet
character
give
a
pretty
good
balance
in
the
finish
i
tasted
a
very
small
hint
of
spice
wonderful
beer
everything
an
oktoberfest
should
be
having
had
a
small
tasting
of
okotoberfests
with
friends
this
one
stood
out
a
nice
bright
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
some
spotty
lacing
smells
are
of
a
floral
and
herb
mix
taste
is
toasty
and
bready
malt
and
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
crisp
and
very
good
i
think
paulaner
makes
a
good
octoberfest
but
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
still
very
drinkable
very
tasty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
standard
for
the
style
dark
golden
orange
nice
thick
offwhite
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
i
found
that
the
paulaner
beers
that
ive
had
have
all
had
a
syrupy
sweetness
to
them
ive
had
the
double
bock
and
i
thought
the
same
thing
tastes
good
nice
maltyness
and
german
beer
flavor
with
just
a
little
bit
too
much
sweetness
not
overpowering
but
its
noticed
a
little
thick
to
be
superdrinkable
good
beer
overall
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
off
white
2finger
head
with
a
slight
hoppy
scent
to
it
this
beer
had
a
hop
flavor
to
it
but
was
also
very
sweet
a
little
bit
more
sweeter
than
most
oktoberfests
i
have
had
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
beer
agian
it
became
clear
to
me
after
having
this
brew
why
paulaner
is
among
the
big
3
of
german
brewers
to
define
the
oktoberfestmarzen
style
with
this
more
than
appropriate
and
highly
regarded
fall
offering
excellent
brew
so
how
could
it
not
be
drinkable
no
problem
at
all
making
a
session
of
this
drinkability
just
wasnt
impressed
didnt
match
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
ive
tasted
better
pilsners
lagers
think
paulaner
is
overated
drinkability
this
beer
is
nice
very
easy
to
drink
and
drink
a
lot
of
paulaner
oktoberfest
marzen
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
toasty
malt
upfront
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
was
a
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
oktoberfest
still
a
cant
go
wrong
choice
if
serving
up
a
plate
of
brats
and
sauerkrat
a
clear
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
vigorous
pour
that
faded
to
a
thin
persistent
wisp
leaving
chunks
then
lines
of
sticky
lace
smells
like
rich
toasted
malts
mostly
caramel
cake
with
hints
of
plum
roasted
chestnut
vanilla
and
burnt
toffee
tastes
equally
rich
with
a
perfectly
placed
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
a
dessert
beer
the
one
thing
that
bothers
me
a
bit
about
the
beer
is
its
sticky
mouthfeel
im
pretty
sure
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
crisper
than
this
i
mean
its
a
malty
lager
but
its
still
a
lager
no
regardless
very
sessionable
even
at
5
8
and
you
can
tell
that
its
textbook
marzen
definitely
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
that
ive
ever
had
hooray
for
paulaner
m
smooth
very
well
carbonated
only
the
off
taste
in
the
finish
puts
this
beer
down
a
rung
or
two
copperruby
read
color
more
than
ample
head
smell
suggests
exactly
what
this
is
which
is
as
good
a
representation
of
the
style
i
know
of
sweet
velvety
malt
and
i
know
this
is
probably
the
power
of
suggstion
but
i
swear
i
smell
pumpkin
in
here
tastes
like
a
meal
eurohops
dance
energetically
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
creating
a
fine
counterpart
to
the
malt
mouthfeel
coats
then
washes
away
clean
a
damn
fine
beer
poured
a
clean
pretty
copper
color
frothy
head
disappeared
fairly
quickly
notes
of
vanilla
in
the
nose
delicious
sweet
malty
flavor
hint
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
underwhelming
maybe
little
thin
but
certainly
not
bad
a
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
brew
there
are
a
few
higher
rated
marzen
beers
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
makes
me
want
to
go
to
munich
in
oktober
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
in
greenwich
ct
it
was
dark
orange
colored
and
clear
with
a
thin
white
layer
of
foam
the
smell
was
dominated
by
malts
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
oktoberfests
are
almost
malt
bombs
lots
of
sweet
malt
with
very
little
bitterness
anyway
this
one
was
nice
and
had
a
really
thick
body
which
lent
a
hand
in
adding
physical
presence
very
good
for
the
style
d
very
wall
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
nothing
extraordinary
but
it
certainly
is
very
much
worth
trying
strong
malt
taste
medium
to
low
carbonation
with
very
little
bite
it
has
a
strong
taste
of
spice
it
is
not
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
had
personally
i
really
like
the
great
lakes
brewing
co
but
it
is
really
pretty
good
i
would
recommend
it
i
would
give
it
a
3
8
out
of
5
great
drinkability
will
be
trying
more
of
this
style
just
afraid
after
this
most
others
wont
stand
up
to
this
one
d
this
is
very
drinkable
by
any
standard
im
happy
to
kick
a
few
of
these
back
as
fall
begins

with

a
perfect
session
beer
for
octoberfest
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
pours
a
reddish
brown
amber
color
with
not
much
head
smells
like
roased
barleyobviously
but
a
little
more
than
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
has
some
other
sweet
sugary

d

an
excellent

beer
seriously
open
your
mind
a
bit
and
try
it
with
a
squeeze
of
lime
im
getting
ready
to
go
to
oktoberfest
for
my
first
time
in
late
september
i
think
this
will
defenitely
be
my
beer
of
choice
for
oktoberfests
it
is
no
doubt
a
classic
and
sould
be
as
its
a
very
tasty
brew
i
love
august
thats
when
the
octoberfestoktoberfest
beers
and
yes
the
pumpkin
ales
start
arriving
in
the
local
store
while
i
havent
yet
been
to
munich
for
oktoberfest
this
paulaner
offering
is
exactly
what
i
imagine
it
would
taste
like
this
one
was
particularly
fresh
and
sat
a
gorgeous
dark
amber
in
the
glass
capped
with
a
14
inch
delicate
foam
head
the
nose
was
all
carmel
and
malt
and
i
noted
that
it
was
rich
and
slightly
sweet
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
also
quite
carmelmalt
but
i
noted
a
very
nice
hops
bitternesseven
a
mild
tartnessin
the
aftertaste
talk
about
complexity
its
like
the
taste
changes
from
sip
to
swallow
excellent
in
terms
of
overall
impression
this
import
easily
beats
even
the
most
wellmade
micros
of
similar
style
those
germans
know
their
oktoberfest
beer
pours
amber
almost
orange
colored
head
dissapates
quickly
all
i
can
smell
is
a
caramel
like
malt
odor
taste
is
also
malts
and
caramel
maybe
some
slight
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
this
stuff
is
great
i
could
easily
drink
34
or
more
of
these
the
maltiness
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
this
interesting
but
its
mild
enough
to
easily
session

beer

d
very
easy
drinker
good
stuff
im
not
sure
which
german
harvest
or
pagan
god
this
oktoberfest
commemorates
or
for
how
long
it
lasts
or
what
else
occurs
besides
the
imbibing
of
spirits
but
it
sure
is
a
sweet
bit
of
carmel
frothy
and
dark
as
a
wet
cave
it
leaves
a
mein
kampf
mustachio
on
your
lip
and
the
feeling
that
you
too
can
overthrow
poland
at
some
point
in
your
storied
life
and
seize
chopins
heart
from
its
tomb
in
the
pillar
at
holy
cross
church
in
krakowskie
this
is
my
fourth
different
paulaner
and
with
the
possible
exception
of
heffeweiss
im
just
not
that
impressed
with
their
line
like
the
others
this
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
head
which
dissipated
almost
immeidately
and
left
little
lacing
the
body
was
thin
the
taste
okay
but
the
finish
watery
i
rated
it
just
under
3
and
i
was
being
kind
at
that
body
is
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
red
what
little
head
it
did
have
was
white
and
receded
quickly
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lacing
scent
is
faint
and
of
fruit
and
spice
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
a
good
brew
even
during
the
hot
summer
days
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
lend
a
smooth
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
while
the
moderate
6
abv
make
it
quite
easy
to
consume
a
pleasant
offering
to
its
style
a
good
german
beer
that
probably
tastes
great
fresh
from
the
brewery
cheers
pours
a
lively
copper
colour
with
decent
head
that
reduces
to
thin
lacing
i
didnt
even
have
to
stick
my
nose
into
it
to
smell
it
the
aroma
filled
the
room
insted
reminded
me
of
biscuits
with
butter
and
molasses
from
my
farm
days
very
rich
smell
the
taste
bore
through
the
smell
molasses
and
biscuits
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
balacing
amout
of
hop
bitterness
simply
awesome
and
captivating
it
holds
your
attention
and
slowly
recedes
to
a
lingering
finish
with
only
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
definately
has
resold
me
on
the
style
as
its
been
10
years
since
i
last
had
an
oktoberfest
and
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
this
salud
a
drinkable
oktober
it
was
free
but
i
wish
it
had
been
fresher
d
a
pleasing
drinkable
beer
not
spectacular
but
seems
a
definite
winner
for
the
big
festivals
and
sessiondrinking
its
intended
for
prost
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
a
standout
beer
good
stuff
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
and
quite
similar
to
how
i
thought
it
would
taste
given
its
appearance
but
not
quite
flavoursome
enough
there
is
a
good
nonoverpowering
toffee
sort
of
flavour
but
otherwise
mostly
just
a
refreshing
beer
taste
certainly
not
unpleasant
but
i
wish
there
could
be
more
to
it
than
that
having
said
that
though
this
is
extremely
drinkable
surprised
to
see
that
i
had
never
reviewed
this
beer
a
frequent
sampling
at
my
local
german
pub
marrikas
a
staple
malty
lager
with
big
bready
and
fruity
notes
and
evidence
of
nice
maturity
and
age
the
beer
appearing
a
hazy
rust
color
and
good
retention
throws
up
good
fruity
esters
in
the
aroma
aromas
and
flavors
of
ripetobruised
fruits
of
figs
dates
and
prunes
maybe
an
orange
apple
and
pear
thrown
in
the
fruit
flavors
begin
to
overtake
the
bready
and
yeasty
flavors
that
are
present
light
alcohols
show
sweetness
throughout
medium
to
heavy
body
for
the
style
finishes
sweet
and
fruity
never
dry
a
good
middleoftheroad
beer
when
you
want
good
flavors
but
not
and
intense
beer
had
an
interesting
aroma
with
alcohol
smell
pours
with
a
really
nice
big
head
a
really
good
sweet
malty
clean
taste
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
at
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
not
too
strong
simple
tasty
and
just
hoppy
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
more
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
offering
from
paulaner
was
shocked
to
see
this
in
the
state
liquor
store
definitely
had
to
pick
it
up
though
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
fell
and
laced
the
top
a
constant
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
rose
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
almost
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
little
weak
compared
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
just
a
little
above
average
quite
enjoyable
a
true
seasonal
classic
drinkabilty
yeah
maybe
another
bottle
in
the
fall
beer
is
very
drinkable
enjoyable
year
round
verdict
top
notch
very
drinkable
2005
bottle
left
over
from
an
octoberfest
party
the
beer
poured
a
bright
redish
amber
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
nice
and
fluffy
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
toasted
malts
and
floral
hops
with
the
malts
winning
out
the
taste
is
more
of
what
you
get
from
the
aroma
some
good
toasty
malts
and
caramel
with
a
bite
of
hop
bitterness
but
mainly
you
get
the
malts
this
beer
is
a
bit
thick
but
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
got
it
from
a
local
brazillian
market
for
4
50
yes
expensive
but
what
can
i
do
i
live
in
brazil
but
as
another
user
said
above
what
a
buy
truly
great
drinkability
malty
and
fullbodied
in
what
concerns
oktoberfest
beer
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
one
smooth
taste
good
looks
and
very
very
drinkable
definetely
worth
a
try
2005
edition
this
one
is
usually
a
favorite
of
mine
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
cap
of
pure
white
aromas
of
heavy
german
malts
and
light
floral
german
hops
i
find
it
hard
to
describe
these
beers
as
anything
but
malty
as
they
are
so
one
dimensional
usually
this
one
taste
like
an
ofest
should
with
some
dying
hop
character
aftertaste
is
a
bit
funky
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
good
i
find
this
one
more
one
dimensional
and
less
drinkable
every
year
though
i
prefer
the
hacker
ofest
amongst
other
choice
this
one
is
too
pricey
too
considering
what
it
is
pretty
good
ill
have
to
try
other
oktoberfestbiers
to
see
how
they
stack
up
to
this
one
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
for
my
liking
and
anfter
one
big
wiesse
glass
of
this
i
was
feeling
kinda
full
maybe
im
just
a
lightweight
this
beer
pours
a
very
deep
copper
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
leaves
quickly
and
doesnt
give
off
any
lacing
the
smell
is
kind
of
adjunctly
sweet
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
a
little
light
it
is
spicy
and
reminded
me
of
some
stirfry
i
made
last
weekend
it
also
has
a
toasted
finish
to
it
that
rounds
it
out
with
some
slight
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
isnt
light
and
it
doesnt
leave
anyting
on
the
tounge
by
the
way
wow
this
stuff
is
drinkable
it
was
a
good
intro
into
the
style
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
i
suspect
i
may
have
graded
this
even
higher
did
i
not
drink
it
right
before
a
celebrator
doppelbock
cheers
d
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
d
great
drinkability
very
close
to
a
5
i
can
imagine
one
of
these
days
sitting
in
a
huge
ofest
tent
hammering
mugs
of
this
highly
quaffable
excellent
session
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
modest
tannish
head
smell
is
strong
of
malt
with
with
great
toasty
notes
and
some
dark
fruitiness
taste
is
mainly
roasted
malt
wuth
some
date
and
prune
tastes
also
present
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
is
malty
with
minimum
hop
character
a
very
good
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
a
solid
true
octoberfest
beer
very
rich
and
very
malty
almost
like
a
mellow
spaten
optimator
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
beers
out
there
extremely
drinkable
hard
to
find
in
nc
but
whenever
i
see
it
i
buy
it
have
i
mentioned
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
classic
oktoberfest
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
if
youve
never
tried
it
rundont
walkout
and
get
some
schnell
d
eminently
drinkable
this
is
like
a
wellmade
piece
of
lightly
spiced
bread
in
liquid
form
or
preferably
have
someone
else
go
buy
it
for
you
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
nice
white
head
impressive
amount
too
relatively
good
retention
lacing
was
okay
at
best
nice
amberauburn
color
with
a
frothy
head
sweet
malty
aroma
almost
like
apples
or
even
apple
cider
subtle
fruity
and
floral
character
to
it
the
sweet
aroma
leads
one
to
believe
that
the
beer
will
also
be
sweet
in
this
case
though
the
beer
may
be
sweet
but
not
overly
so
like
some
other
oktoberfests
that
ive
tried
it
balances
well
with
next
to
no
hoppy
bitterness
any
hops
in
this
beer
are
very
well
hidden
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
without
much
of
an
overbearing
aftertaste
nice
and
smooth
going
down
and
should
be
considered
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
on
the
market
this
year
drinkability
im
highly
disappointed
with
this
especially
after
the
hefeweizen
being
so
damn
good
i
guess
from
paulaner
i
expected
a
lot
more
there
are
many
domestics
that
are
better
for
my
money
at
this
point
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
with
some
prickly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
which
is
somewhat
refreshing
and
keeps
the
sweetness
from
getting
out
of
hand
on
the
palate
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
and
darn
good
even
if
youre
experienced
yum
opinion
this
is
a
really
clean
and
refreshing
beer
i
am
eating
it
with
pizza
now
and
it
compliments
the
flavor
nicely
this
is
one
of
those
tasty
brews
that
you
can
drink
all
year
not
just
in
the
fall
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
recent
edit
for
sept
2006
this
beer
is
better
than
ever
theres
a
new
slight
toastiness
im
picking
up
that
i
really
enjoy
im
noticing
that
the
head
retention
is
much
better
too
i
think
this
my
favorite
overall
beer
honestly
it
doesnt
really
have
the
depth
of
some
other
items
but
in
terms
of
sheer
drinkability
and
good
flavor
this
is
it
for
me
nice
hats
off
to
paulaner
a
seriously
drinkable
brew
and
one
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
try
again
almost
the
opposite
end
of
the
oktoberfest
spectrum
from
hofbrau
but
easily
the
end
i
would
prefer
the
body
is
very
full
and
is
quite
good
and
makes
the
drinkability
quite
nice
a
very
nice
looking
marzen
with
an
orangish
copper
body
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
aroma
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
toasted
bread
caramel
minerals
and
some
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
subtle
yet
complex
with
notes
of
toasted
bread
caramel
minerals
grassy
and
spicy
noble
hops
round
out
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
little
bit
chewy
but
spot
on
for
a
marzen
this
is
a
really
solid
marzen
in
fact
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
is
enjoyable
for
a
style
i
dont
personally
like
very
much
and
that
says
something
d
good
session
beer
but
not
every
session
if
you
know
what
i
mean
12
oz
bottled
on
0705
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
burnt
honey
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
that
leaves
bits
of
lace
soft
and
malty
in
the
nose
with
hops
and
caramelmolasses
floralspicy
hops
contribute
a
mild
bitterness
to
the
palate
and
the
malts
are
semirich
it
is
pleasant
and
simple
with
a
medium
to
light
body
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinking
drimkability
is
very
high
definitley
a
fantastic
fall
session
beer
this
is
one
that
i
will
probably
pick
up
every
autumn
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
provide
a
measuring
stick
by
which
to
judge
all
the
other
octoberfests
i
buy
notes
this
particular
bottle
wasnt
as
good
as
previous
ones
ive
had
however
it
was
still
a
pleasant
brew
light
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
after
a
minute
or
two
leaving
a
film
on
the
beers
surface
gently
rising
carbonation
the
aroma
is
fairly
strong
full
of
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
bready
element
this
is
the
classic
oktoberfest
aroma
the
taste
begins
with
a
strong
malty
sweetness
riding
on
top
of
a
breadiness
that
keeps
the
sweetness
from
being
cloying
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
watery
and
light
this
is
a
solid
and
classic
example
of
the
style
but
perhaps
theyre
resting
on
their
laurels
i
know
theres
a
better
tasting
oktoberfest
made
right
down
the
road
from
me
16
9
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
shade
of
a
lighter
copper
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
to
it
the
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
with
some
floral
and
spicy
notes
the
taste
is
a
slightly
lighter
medium
bodied
beer
with
some
sweet
maltiness
with
a
somewhat
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
a
decent
oktoberfest
copper
colored
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
honeyish
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
background
minerally
hop
zing
the
nose
is
bright
biscuit
malt
flavors
with
subtle
citrus
zest
mid
palate
full
mouthfeel
and
the
classic
german
malt
flavors
are
complemented
but
not
overpowered
by
the
hops
the
finish
is
snappy
and
clean
with
a
faint
bready
aftertaste
great
malt
flavors
and
enough
hops
to
make
it
complex
and
well
balanced
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
ive
tried
overall
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
very
well
balance
with
no
annoying
aftertaste
like
some
others
ive
had
definitely
try
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
oktobers
if
not
it
might
change
your
opinion
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
lots
of
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
for
background
balance
a
sweet
aftertaste
sticks
for
a
minute
body
somewhat
light
mouthfeel
ok
but
somewhat
lacking
in
thickness
at
the
finish
drinkability
is
fine
its
ok
but
not
great
overall
pours
a
deep
ambercopper
colour
virtually
no
carbonation
with
a
thin
cream
head
that
struggles
to
hold
form
all
the
way
down
very
toasty
in
the
nose
smells
of
roasted
caramel
if
yall
will
let
me
say
that
malty
sweetness
in
taste
sweet
caramel
up
front
is
followed
by
a
hoppy
crispness
to
finish
it
off
alcohol
is
prevelent
but
in
no
way
overbearing
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
definately
sit
down
at
a
table
and
drink
this
allday
long
in
the
halls
of
munich
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
is
one
where
you
savour
every
last
delicious
drop
pours
a
very
clean
mediumcopper
color
with
cream
colored
head
good
retention
with
some
slight
lacing
i
detect
roasted
malts
and
not
much
else
the
bitterness
is
upfront
with
a
bit
of
warming
sensation
following
very
much
like
an
amber
ale
only
smoother
there
is
a
bit
of
a
peppery
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
is
enjoyable
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
thin
mouthfeel
but
the
lack
of
stomach
fill
just
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
a
nice
amber
one
that
id
love
to
try
again
having
said
that
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
i
actually
think
that
i
might
like
american
microbrews
take
on
the
oktoberfest
better
than
the
german
original
the
beer
felt
lightbodied
and
the
taste
was
well
delicate
this
is
not
the
fluessiges
brot
that
i
expect
from
a
german
beer
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
failed
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
especially
when
it
would
have
bought
me
a
4pack
of
sprecher
flavor
was
sweet
carmel
with
just
a
hint
of
bitternes
at
the
end
nose
is
very
sweet
malted
must
have
lots
of
munich
in
it
and
dry
hersbruck
like
hops
not
much
influence
of
yeast
nose
except
the
formed
alcohol
aftertaste
is
only
bitterness
and
good
yeah
this
is
still
good
even
if
the
brewery
became
heiniken
lets
hope
it
stays
like
this
in
time
cause
this
is
a
brew
i
always
liked
been
at
the
fest
itself
so
many
times
and
always
liked
this
one
as
one
of
the
best
fine
but
not
to
high
carbonisation
makes
mouthfeel
good
and
balanced
drinkability
is
that
that
i
had
8
of
those
mfs
at
the
oktoberfest
in
a
row
once
it
took
me
a
year
to
appreciate
the
subtleties
of
beers
like
this
one
last
years
oktoberfest
was
a
bit
of
a
bust
looking
forward
to
getting
a
1
5
liter
mug
of
this
and
some
wurst
and
trying
some
of
those
britishers
again
cheers
this
is
one
of
the
bockiest
marzens
ive
ever
had
and
also
one
of
the
best
refreshing
and
very
easily
drank
i
bought
this
one
in
a
5
liter
keg
for
a
party
and
found
it
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
since
the
mini
keg
only
costed
18
it
was
very
rich
in
malty
flavors
and
some
breadish
notes
and
a
little
dry
spice
it
was
very
clean
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
sweeter
than
most
oktoberfests
that
i
have
tried
500
ml
bottle
pours
out
copper
colored
with
a
small
head
malty
bread
aroma
with
some
caramel
the
flavor
starts
off
as
sweet
caramel
with
toasted
malts
german
hops
come
in
but
cant
quite
balance
the
sweet
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
pretty
good
drinkability
i
like
the
big
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
but
it
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
still
this
version
is
quite
good
i
imagine
that
this
would
pair
with
sauerkraut
and
wurst
just
about
as
well
as
anything
out
there
or
as
aforementioned
putting
a
few
back
would
alone
would
be
fine
also
very
enjoyable
oktoberfest
a
simple
pleasure
for
the
season
fully
satisfying
try
some
bottle
obtained
from
liquor
mart
and
consumed
later
that
same
evening
pours
a
two
finger
tandark
yellow
head
over
a
crystal
clear
light
rustorange
lqiuid
smells
mild
some
toasted
grains
and
the
hopp
aroma
is
orange
peels
whatever
also
a
tangy
melon
smell
tastes
smooth
sweet
and
sharply
carbonated
aftertastes
starts
with
toasted
grains
and
a
hint
of
caramel
nice
flat
munich
malt
character
that
starts
chalky
and
finishes
sourish
also
a
hint
of
smoke
interesting
the
bottle
was

smell
is
exactly
what
it
should
smell
likea
very
malty
oktoberfest
tastewisethere
is
sweetness
and
caramel
and
tones
of
apple
too
in
fact
a
little
too
sour
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
in
past
years
maybe
the
recent
thread
about
hacker
has
influenced
my
judgement
but
i
dont
think
so
its
just
not
as
good
this
year
despite
this
not
being
my
favorite
oktoberfest
bier
ive
ever
tasted
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
a
bad
place
to
start
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
marzen
extremely
drinkable
i
can
feel
the
cold
winds
of
october
acomin
p
typical
oktoberfest
color
a
reddishgold
nice
thick
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
very
good
lacing
smells
and
tastes
very
sweet
like
molasses
or
artificial
grape
flavoring
theres
some
dustiness
to
the
flavor
which
also
features
a
slightly
bitter
and
toasted
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
overall
paulaners
oktoberfest
is
just
too
sweet
and
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
mouthfeel
is
decent
nice
chewy
breadiness
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
highlighting
some
sweets
and
sours
had
three
different
okt
brews
this
weekend
with
victory
and
lancaster
this
one
outshone
the
rest
on
all
categories
its
very
smooth
and
pleasant
going
down
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
rich
and
tangy
a
hearty
brew
for
the
fall
season
but
very
drinkable
for
one
or
twoish
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
ofest
ive
tried
this
year
just
a
wellbalanced
stab
at
it
taste
is
pure
bliss
with
a
wonderful
blend
of
spicy
noble
hops
and
toasty
grainy
caramel
maltiness
the
body
lightens
a
bit
for
the
finish
as
the
bittering
spicy
hops
come
to
life
very
tasty
with
a
clean
and
dry
finish
by
far
the
most
drinkable
of
the
oktoberfest
biers
ive
sampled
this
september
i
would
gladly
keep
a
couple
of
cases
of
this
bavarian
around
for
pleasure
drinkability
is
fantastic
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
shit
for
that
matter
just
a
good
brew
in
general
put
me
down
for
5
or
6
d
its
like
water
no
better
than
water
very
drinkable
though
not
weak
great
full
taste
love
this
stuff
this
märzen
poured
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
malty
biscuity
with
a
touch
of
yeast
the
taste
was
malty
with
notes
of
munich
malt
and
a
very
mild
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
malty
flavors
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
nicely
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
beer
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
but
it
went
very
well
with
the
marinted
lake
trout
that
i
had
for
dinner
drinkability
moderate
this
is
their
best
year
so
far
and
the
keg
is
the
only
way
to
go
served
in
a
one
liter
stein
at
my
favorite
local
german
haunt
a
light
coppery
beer
with
a
full
white
head
the
leaves
it
lace
all
the
way
down
a
full
complex
malt
smell
smacks
my
face
as
i
get
foam
on
my
nose
from
smelling
too
close
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
higher
weight
sugars
that
mix
well
with
the
german
spicecy
hops
to
produce
a
taste
that
is
pure
fall
the
cleaness
of
this
beer
is
a
beauty
in
its
own
right
after
one
liter
i
order
a
second
and
hand
my
keys
off
to
my
lovely
dd
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
twofinger
head
that
has
a
little
staying
power
very
clear
no
haze
laces
the
glass
well
smell
the
caramelly
malt
and
taste
it
as
well
i
believe
i
am
partial
to
this
style
i
havent
ran
into
a
marzen
that
i
have
not
liked
finishes
just
dry
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
great

the

actually
a
bit
more
of
that
may
have
helped
to
disipate
some
of
that
forward
nuttiness
i
would
probably
give
this
one
another
try
if
i
come
accross
it
on
tap
but
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
another
one
of
these
in
a
bottle
pours
a
nutty
medium
brown
colour
with
a
nice
bubbly
off
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
notes
of
nuts
caramel
and
bread
taste
is
predominately
the
malt
taste
however
it
never
becomes
sweet
and
is
extremely
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
light
carbonation
that
gives
the
beer
a
sort
of
lush
creaminess
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
a
great
allday
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
large
variety
of
foods
perfect
for
a
fall
day
grill
out
and
football
second
beer
in
a
octoberfest
tasting
medium
copper
in
color
small
white
head
and
lightly
carbonated
nose
has
a
slight
malt
aroma
flavor
contains
some
grassiness
and
some
sweet
malt
beer
finishes
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
more
of
the
same
sweetness
was
nicer
than
becks
oktoberfest
which
was
first
beer
tasted
all
this
with
a
date
of
08
04
on
the
label
this
beer
might
also
make
a
good
intro
into
import
brews
for
any
fan
of
sam
adams
lager
has
many
of
the
positives
of
sa
with
few
of
the
negatives
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
be
having
again
as
soon
as
possible
a
not
too
frumpy
easy
drinker
smooth
creamy
very
drinkable
my
favorite
oktoberfest
so
far
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
a
smallish
rocky
head
smells
of
bread
biscuits
and
caramel
sweeter
than
i
expected
tastes
very
light
and
refreshing
with
predominantly
caramellysweet
flavors
but
also
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
finish
is
slightly
dry
light
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
a
good
session
beer
as
ben
said
my
stomach
knows
a
good
beer
and
with
a
name
like
strehlmann
i
am
sure
it
does
according
to
paulaners
website
their
oktoberfest
is
only
available
between
july
and
october
this
accounts
for
how
cheap
it
was
to
fill
this
growler
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
some
orangy
highlights
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
grainyhusky
vienna
malt
aroma
typical
of
a
good
oktoberfest
with
a
light
hoppiness
very
clean
smelling
and
inviting
i
know
it
is
really
not
that
fresh
but
it
doesnt
come
across
that
way
in
the
taste
a
nice
husky
and
grainy
malt
profile
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
very
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
fresh
this
coming
oktoberfest
season
no
complaints
and
the
price
was
definitely
right
highly
enjoyable
standardized
oktoberfest
well
maintained
flavors
and
aroma
suitable
for
drinking
yearround
expecting
something
of
exceptional
quality
i
stumbled
into
quite
a
fair
ale
not
much
in
any
category
but
there
is
quality
in
how
they
did
that
musty
aroma
some
initial
head
but
nothing
to
look
at
suitable
above
average
carbonation
some
malts
and
some
bitterness
and
astringency
in
finish
with
dry
bitter
aftertaste
thats
best
part
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
this
makes
an
excellent
session
brew
any
time
of
the
year
drinkability
a
highly
quaffable
oktoberfest
definitely
recomended
a
lovely
marzen
that
pours
out
with
the
characteristic
orangelight
brown
body
this
one
seems
a
little
lighter
and
more
translucent
than
others
i
have
had
a
nice
resilent
offwhite
head
is
apparent
and
sticks
around
to
chill
with
me
for
a
bit
the
aromas
i
love
from
oktoberfests
are
all
here
slight
toastiness
gentle
caramelly
malts
and
nuttiness
one
smell
im
glad
that
isnt
present
is
skunk
because
this
festbier
comes
in
a
lovely
brown
bottle
this
beer
is
a
really
smooth
drinker
nice
slick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
mostly
biscuity
and
caramelly
malts
with
a
crisp
noble
hop
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
really
nice
marzen
i
think
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
fuller
in
the
mouth
though
i
can
drink
this
all
night
very
very
drinkable
pairs
great
with
other
staples
of
oktoberfest
food
such
as
sausages
and
sauerkraut
also
goes
well
with
beef
dishes
worldclass
all
the
way
around
the
beer
is
just
so
drinkable
and
definitely
a
treat
every
autumn
although
you
can
now
find
it
yearround
and
depending
upon
your
point
of
view
can
be
disturbing
my
only
gripe
with
the
bottle
version
i
had
is
that
it
was
slightly
undercarbonated
yet
i
definitely
wont
let
that
deter
me
from
future
samplings
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
leaving
a
nice
lace
malty
sweet
red
licorice
smell
with
spicy
hops
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
malty
grainy
sweet
taste
with
a
sweet
n
spicy
euro
hop
finish
a
smooth
easy
drinking
brew
probably
much
better
fresh
than
it
is
in
a
bottle
drinkability
quite
high
should
have
got
out
my
stein
from
germany
and
quaffed
a
few
but
i
didnt
want
to
have
to
clean
the
dang
thing
out
stupid
flip
top
lid
deep
auburn
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
a
very
malty
taste
and
slightly
spicy
as
well
but
for
the
most
part
the
malt
dominates
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
very
versatile
i
could
have
it
in
either
the
summer
or
winter
and
be
satisfied
great
representation
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
for
a
second
opinion
this
is
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
d
very
versatile
heavy
enough
for
a
cold
evening
equally
welcome
at
the
summer
bbq
i
look
forward
to
this
brew
every
fall
and
have
never
been
disappointed
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
a
little
on
the
sharp
side
but
still
full
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
without
much
sign
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
pours
dark
gold
not
much
head
and
minimal
lacingbut
very
nicely
carbonated
appearence
is
a
bit
hazy
good
malt
upfront
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
with
a
dry
finish
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
very
drinkable
so
far
this
year
i
think
i
prefer
hackerpschorrs
oktoberfest
but
this
is
pretty
good
a
reddishcopper
beer
meets
the
glass
and
creates
a
foamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
for
a
horribly
long
time
smell
hits
me
while
im
pouring
it
and
its
all
heady
malts
the
taste
walks
closely
to
the
nose
with
some
nice
caramel
and
an
earthy
overall
sweetness
posesses
a
tangyzing
flavour
mouthfeel
is
smooth
supports
the
flavours
nicely
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
sweet
and
nice
good
easydrinking
beer
that
is
not
complicated
and
has
good
balance
throughout
recommended
i
got
excited
when
i
saw
this
one
in
the
store
because
in
my
book
paulaner
is
synonomous
with
quality
this
oktoberfest
certainly
isnt
bad
but
for
me
it
is
a
middleoftheroad
beer
not
quite
up
to
some
of
paulaners
other
brews
it
has
a
nice
goldenbrown
color
and
a
somewhat
thin
but
decent
head
the
taste
is
smooth
and
a
little
malty
with
some
floral
overtones
and
some
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
okay
and
it
goes
down
well
enough
the
bitterness
does
make
it
a
bit
tough
to
down
several
nice
rich
copper
color
with
a
pretty
good
tan
head
smells
very
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
easily
predicted
by
the
smell
lots
toasted
caramel
nuttiness
up
front
a
bit
bready
faint
fruitiness
and
hoppiness
towards
the
back
not
bad
at
all
rich
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
goes
down
real
easy
solid
oktoberfest
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
very
similar
to
the
spaten
ofest
but
i
think
i
like
this
one
marginally
better
as
an
aside
id
love
to
find
the
label
art
of
this
beer
in
print
form
for
framing
pale
golden
pour
with
an
orange
tint
seemed
a
bit
light
for
a
fest
bier
the
body
was
topped
by
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
that
left
some
decent
lacing
as
it
departed
the
aroma
was
richly
malty
with
earthy
bready
notes
wafting
through
the
taste
was
as
advertised
with
bready
caramel
malt
and
sweet
esters
giving
just
a
hint
of
bananas
the
aftertaste
was
grainy
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
a
bit
closer
to
a
macro
offering
than
i
prefer
but
a
very
appropriate
session
drink
for
the
season
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
and
the
minikeg
is
a
fun
addition
not
bad
by
any
means
but
could
have
been
better
had
on
tap
at
bones
medium
amber
it
came
topped
with
a
white
head
clean
aroma
maybe
a
faint
whiff
of
brown
bread
taste
was
sweet
and
smooth
mostly
bready
and
lagerish
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
and
to
be
honest
i
think
maybe
it
was
too
smooth
so
it
actually
seemed
a
bit
blah
like
it
didnt
want
to
offend
or
shock
would
try
it
again
though
especially
if
i
was
in
dland
eh
its
okay
the
beer
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
and
in
hindsight
i
have
to
say
this
may
be
my
benchmark
for
a
fine
oktoberfest
it
comes
from
the
bottle
bright
amber
to
copper
with
a
light
creamy
head
and
a
surprising
sheet
of
lace
a
small
stream
of
champagne
bubbles
renews
the
head
after
a
time
the
nose
is
all
malt
with
hints
of
candy
and
figs
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
and
more
of
the
candy
overtones
mid
drink
with
a
creamy
light
finish
and
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
and
a
great
candidate
for
a
session
beer
a
really
nice
oktoberfest

taste

upfront

balanced
by
the

character
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
and
it
goes
down
like
all
oktoberfests
should
easy
an
excellent
brew
overall
this
beer
didnt
strike
me
down
as
hugely
malty
its
noble
hopping
kept
the
package
very
festive
and
drinkable
with
most
oktoberfests
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy

welcoming
for
morning
afternoon
and
evening

sessions
pours
a
pretty
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
that
is
topped
by
a
light
amber
white
head
that
is
fairly
thick
the
aroma
is
light
with
notes
of
caramel
fresh
baked
bread
and
bready
malt
notes
actually
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
though
subtle
at
first
it
really
comes
to
life
the
more
you
get
into
it
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
smooth
somewhat
creamy
a
little
bit
sweet
and
has
a
finish
that
is
a
bit
hoppy
the
toasty
bready
flavors
are
here
as
well
and
really
add
a
nice
touch
to
this
beer
a
fairly
simple
beer
that
has
a
nice
touch
of
munich
vienna
malt
complexity
and
just
a
hint
of
hoppiness
zum
wohl
definitely
one
of
the
better
german
oktoberfests
for

money

dissapointing
mostly
grain
with
some
unpleasant
undercurrants
this
unpleasant
undercurrant

noticable
in
the
taste
otherwise

beer
is
very
drinkable
abd
i
could
have
a
session
of
these
but
is
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
because
of
the
rank
smell
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
had
this
beer
with
several
other
oktoberfests

it

quite
well

have
had

the
quintisential
ofest
in
my
book
very
nice
oktoberfest
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
tiny
white

the
smell
is
of
toasted

the
taste
in
the
beginning
has
a
nice
array
of
toasted
grain
and
caramel
sweetness
a
light
floral

is
detected
and
brings
this
beer
together
hints
of
spices
and
herbs
in
the
rear
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
i
have
hoped
more
from
this
one
it
was
a
slight
disappointment
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
decent
head
in
a
lovely
0
5
liter
stange
fairly
malty
aroma
but
the
best
part
of
the
beer
was
the
crisp
firm
well
balanced
quaffability
of
the
beer
carbonation
was
spot
on
the
balance
of
malt
and
noble
hops
was
a
pleasure
i
wish
it
were
less
expensive
because
i
would
have
a
few
mighty
sessions
with
this
most
enjoyable
flavorfula
and
easy
drinking
beer
makes
me
yearn
for
the
biergartens
of
munchen
12

fruity
malty

pleasant
stuff
not
my
fav
style
but
cannot
deny
that
this
are
good
everyday
drinkin
suds
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
oktoberfest
beer
what
else
can
one
say
this
is
paulaners
bestselling
beer
in
the
us
and
deservedly
so
excellent
execution
by
the
brewers
a
bewitching
natural
shade
of
amber
burnt
orange
caramel
malty
aroma
straightforward
but
dead
on
sweeter
than
it
is
bready
this
is
a
smoother
more
user
friendly
octoberfest
than
some
others
it
lacks
any
negative
astringency
or
aggressive
graininess
theres
some
in
the
finish
but
this
is
largely
a
creamy
sweet
malty
brew
with
exceedingly
good
balance
crisp
and
remarkably
drinkable
great
head
dense
fine
lasting
perfectly
on
a
dark
orange
color
body
the
smell
shows
very
light
hints
of
butter
and
toffee
nicely
caramelized
with
some
notes
reminiscent
of
a
barn
or
maybe
thats
just
the
place
where
im
having
this
beer
the
taste
is
thicker
than
expected
with
some
chocolate
bitterness
and
with
almost
smoky
hints
of
toast
light
liquorish
hints
of
red
fruits
hops
are
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
isnt
weak
but
isnt
overpowering
either
just
adequate
this
beer
has
some
character
interesting
joey
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
almost
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
leaves
some
impressive
lacing
it
smells
of
a
nice
malty
character
that
makes
you
think
of
oktoberfest
even
though
i
have
never
been
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
is
like
with
thousands
of
people
drinking
this
stuff
i
like
to
close
my
eyes
and
think
about
it
when
i
smell
and
taste
this
it
has
a
nice
malty
taste
which
has
a
sweet
nutty
taste
that
i
bet
goes
really
well
with
bratwurst
or
sourkraut
or
any
other
german
foods
that
i
cant
think
of
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
a
chewy
thick
coating
to
it
very
complex
and
very
satisfying
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
like
i
am
sure
i
would
if
i
were
in
germany
during
oktoberfest
i
know
it
is
just
now
september
but
damn
i
love
this
time
of
year
maybe
its
because
i
am
drinking
it
at
work
but
i
am
really
digging
this
beer
clear
brillant
dark
copper
witha
nice
farily
thick
off
white
head
sweet
and
almost
chewy
cracked
grain
aromas
mostly
of
vienna
malt
i
think
very
clean
and
balanced
though
there
is
a
cloying
residual
sweetness
that
seems
to
build
up
in
the
finish
still
very
drinkable
as
it
should
be
i
good
go
for
a
few
liters
of
this
anytime
this
oktoberfest
beer
from
munich
pours
a
nice
copper
colour
into
the
glass
the
head
is
abouth
an
inch
thick
and
long
lasting
the
smell
is
malty
very
malty
with
some
hint
of
alcohol
too
the
taste
is
also
malty
and
bready
with
some
hints
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
some
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
too
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
drink
more
of
this
fall
deep
mohagany
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
though
smell
is
really
caramelly
sweet
with
a
cherry
flavor
underneath
taste
begins
with
more
caramel
sweetness
and
caramel
dominates
my
palate
throughout
theres
a
nutty
flavor
underneath
which
is
accompanied
by
a
smoky
kick
hops
linger
in
the
back
and
are
spicy
theres
nothing
extremely
phenomenol
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
all
around
i
think
this
is
the
way
oktoberfests
were
meant
to
taste
this
beer
goes
down
good
on
a
hot
summers
day
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
pilsener
but
with
the
complexity
of
an
ale
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
typical
example
of
the
style
my
first
marzen
style
beer
i
definently
want
to
try
some
more
of
this
style
in
the
future
extremely
smooth
with
great
malt
characteristics
that
glide
along
the
tongue
slightly
sweet
with
the
barest
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
the
solid
malt
character
tells
you
all
you
need
to
know
about
this
beer
the
understated
sweetness
allows
the
flavor
of
the
grain
to
stand
out
after
this
one
a
second
is
certainly
possible
but
one
might
fill
the
bill
just
as
well
as
all
that
malt
can
certainly
fill
ones
gullet
so
it
may
not
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
but
its
good
and
capable
and
thats
not
so
bad
really
sampled
2604
its
straight
forward
not
alot
of
complexity
just
that
deep
maltiness
light
nuttiness
and
that
light
stickiness
in
th
mouth
you
would
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
this
beer
knows
what
it
is
and
just
sticks
with
it
amazingly
drinkable
and
statisfying
not
the
greatest
marzen
but
a
damn
good
one
nice
drinkable
brew
i
think
hop
monsters
have
deadened
my
sense
of
taste
seems
to
be
a
decent
beer
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
any
single
session
perhaps
the
reason
for
that
is
my
ameicanized
taste
the
crisp
citruslike
hop
presence
was
a
surprise
for
this
brew
but
altogether
the
beer
was
not
very
challenging
to
the
tastebuds
it
was
quite
simple
and
perhaps
a
bit
boring
this
is
probably
a
good
beer
to
chug
while
standing
in
the
crowds
in
münchen
as
it
is
crisp
and
very
drinkable
it
ends
up
being
a
decent
amber
beer
but
i
could
probably
get
a
domestic
microamber
for
much
less
than
the
price
of
this
amber
whiskey
color
with
a
beautiful
spongey
head
im
a
sucker
for
rich
malty
aromas
and
this
has
a
great
one
mediumbodied
malt
flavor
nothing
too
grand
but
this
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
pretty
average
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
ive
tried
not
bad
but
not
what
i
had
expected
from
the
worlds
most
widelyconsumed
oktoberfest
beer
i
would
call
this
a
quite
average
oktoberfest
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
getting
saturated
tonight
i
would
certainly
rather
drink
ayinger
for
this
seasonal
clear
medium
amber
color
with
a
creamcolored
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
to
a
thin
film
smell
was
sweet
malt
taste
was
initially
slightly
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
malty
with
roasted
grain
and
a
little
carmel
flavor
followed
by
a
nice
grassy
hop
flavor
with
just
the
barest
touch
of
bitterness
clean
finish
with
almost
no
aftertaste
medium
body
very
nice
overall
would
be
really
easy
to
throw
back
a
number
of
these
it
pours
a
clear
copper
color
it
has
a
malty
aroma
with
some
hop
character
the
smooth
body
has
some
light
toasted
maltiness
it
finishes
with
some
noble
hops
it
has
a
little
too
much
hop
character
for
a
marzen
but
the
toasty
malt
character
is
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
have
grown
more
accustomed
to
the
marzen
style
this
version
seemed
a
bit
bready
smelling
which
is
nice
but
had
a
strong
eurograin
presence
i
suspect
the
sweetness
is
the
caramel
hopping
the
finish
is
slightly
biscuity
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
the
quality
of
hackerpschorr
ocktoberfest
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
foggy
dark
amber
color
and
smelled
fairly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
clover
honey
smooth
body
with
just
a
brief
tingling
feeling
left
on
the
tongue
as
for
the
taste
it
is
sweet
and
malty
almost
cidery
after
the
initial
flavor
dies
down
a
thick
hoppy
aftertaste
follows
leaving
tones
of
alcohol
on
the
tastebuds
this
was
the
first
marzen
beer
ive
tasted
but
if
its
any
indication
of
the
style
ill
be
sure
to
try
many
more
next
fall
reddish
copper
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
of
cookie
dough
malt
tobacco
and
slight
fruitiness
taste
starts
off
with
cookie
dough
malts
apple
cider
toast
and
light
hops
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
lingering
medicinal
malts
and
alcohol
medium
body
im
not
a
big
marzen
fan
but
i
really
liked
this
one
nice
work
paulaner
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
creamy
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
good
again
its
malty
with
a
creamy
finish
it
is
slightly
bitter
but
highly
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
fest
beer
it
is
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
best
ive
had
drinkability

after
drinking
the
skagit
river
oktoberfest
that
almost
made
me
barf
this
was
a
pleasure
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
little
more
refinement
in
the
grain
but
otherwise
this
was
a
hit
tatses
like
a
good
ofest
should
with
lots
of
toasted
nut
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
mildly
hopped
mouthfeel
and
body
are
dead
middle
of
the
road
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
bright
clear
ruby
red
with
a
thin
sheetlike
head
stringy
carbonation
a
big
malty
and
toasty
aroma
sweet
malts
noted
on
top
caramel
like
and
very
creamy
noble
hops
extremely
noticeable
in
the
body
seem
to
overpower
the
initial
maltbased
body
some
delicate
spicy
offerings
yet
a
crisp
clean
palate
a
definite
quaffable
marzen
has
great
character
also
serves
as
a
good
session
brew
one
to
search
for
in
the
early
fall
good
stuff
only
down
point
is
it
didnt
stand
up
to
food
to
well
but
thats
fine
happy
to
drink
it
one
its
own
mouthfeel
i
noticed
a
lot
of
carbonation
decent
mouthfeel
just
a
little
on
the
watery
side
appearance
amber
copper
tone
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
head
doesnt
last
all
that
long
but
does
leave
behind
some
pleasantly
strewn
lacing
around
my
glass
aroma
robust
caramel
roasts
with
slightly
toasted
nuts
even
seems
a
bit
spicy
not
bad
taste
finishes
very
clean
but
the
toasted
malt
character
gives
it
a
great
flavor
doesnt
overdo
anything
very
reserved
but
hella
drinkable
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
the
only
thing
i
can
say
im
disappointed
about
here
just
seems
watery
i
even
recall
the
original
munich
formula
having
more
body
but
hey
sturdy
carbonation
excellent
ofest
drinkability
by
far
one
of
the
better
ofests
outta
of
germany
i
enjoyed
it
from
beginning
to
end
gonna
buy
a
case
next
year
paulaner
was
the
first
beer
garden
i
vistited
during
last
years
fest
where
i
could
find
a
seat
ill
always
remember
they
were
the
first
to
bring
me
a
liter
thanks
to
aaronh
for
this
sample
otherwise
would
have
missed
this
one
amongst
the
best
of
the
munich
oktoberfests
a
decent
beer
and
one
id
have
again
good
though
not
really
my
style
still
its
excellent
with
food
brats
especially
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
maplebronze
colour
with
an
almost
nonexistant
head
lovely
maltsweetspice
smell
which
was
also
reflected
in
the
taste
as
it
is
sweet
and
spicy
as
well
almost
reminicent
of
maple
syrup
in
after
taste
not
potency
of
sugar
or
consistency
of
course
very
lightweight
mouthfeel
with
almost
negligible
amounts
of
carbonation
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
dislike
this
its
brilliant
easily
one
of
my
favourites
overall
it
is
just
too
sweet
and
i
did
not
think
it
feels
very
good
on
draught
at
spagio
in
grandview
this
beer
is
coppercolored
with
a
medium
light
beige
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
some
caramel
as
well
mediumbodied
and
not
overly
sweet
like
some
marzens
tend
to
be
which
i
appreciated
good
malt
flavor
that
was
not
too
thick
or
syrupy
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
very
drinkable
and
complemented
my
food
well
maybe
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
id
get
it
again
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
there
is
only
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
and
grassy
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
fairly
grassy
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
good
and
so
is
the
drinkability
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
overall
impression
clean
well
made
beer
i
get
an
earthy
taste
in
a
good
way
and
malt
malt
malt
a
classic
oktoberfest
the
beer
came
out
only
slightly
darker
than
gold
under
a
good
thick
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
lace
and
excellent
retention
plenty
of
malt
filled
the
nose
while
the
mouth
was
prickly
with
a
body
just
slightly
on
the
light
side
of
medium
there
was
lots
and
lots
of
malt
in
the
opening
taste
chased
by
a
bit
of
hops
that
left
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
initial
taste
i
noted
just
a
hint
of
sourness
but
this
disappeared
as
i
got
further
into
the
experience
a
good
drinking
beer
id
happily
have
another
once
poured
many
many
agitated
bubbles
rise
to
create
a
frothy
yet
soapy
head
a
nice
dark
golden
colour
that
is
very
transparent
the
nose
is
similar
to
paulaners
weiss
bier
with
caramel
apricot
notes
roasted
scents
are
released
as
it
warms
this
one
coats
the
tongue
with
malt
nice
bier
yet
not
my
favorite
of
the
paulaner
line
taste
rich
roasted
malt
and
grains
that
glides
to
caramel
then
to
hops
nice
an
chewy
with
a
good
punch
of
carbonation
finishes
very
clean
with
a
slight
hop
and
spice
to
it
wonderfully
balanced
and
increadibly
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
season
this
beer
was
a
solid
amber
color
had
a
strong
fragrant
sweet
malt
aroma
strong
carmelly
malty
taste
that
seemed
to
lose
these
features
quickly
seemed
to
me
a
perfect
beer
if
you
are
a
smoker
you
get
quick
initial
bursts
of
flavor
then
you
enjoy
your
smoke
this
beer
came
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
a
very
interesting
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
promising
with
caramel
malts
being
the
forerunner
the
flavor
was
not
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
the
caramel
malt
is
the
strongest
part
of
the
flavor
but
there
is
a
certain
bitterness
that
i
did
not
like
with
this
one
the
bitter
bite
makes
me
give
it
low
marks
for
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
john
this
oktoberfest
brew
as
expected
pours
a
deep
orange
amber
color
theres
a
small
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
aroma
is
of
nice
sweet
malts
caramel
notes
with
bready
grains
some
mild
hops
are
also
on
the
nose
the
start
is
smooth
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
malt
adds
a
foundation
to
this
brew
that
holds
everything
together
from
start
to
finish
the
carbonation
picks
up
a
bit
towards
the
middle
when
a
little
yeasty
breadiness
comes
through
theres
a
nice
crispness
to
this
brew
some
slightly
bitter
hops
come
are
apparent
in
the
fairly
short
finish
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
last
very
long
malts
are
still
noticeable
through
the
finish
and
into
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
seems
to
feel
a
little
thicker
into
the
finish
very
drinkable
brew
if
only
it
was
october
year
round
i
wouldnt
have
to
wade
through
disappointing
hefe
weizens
to
get
to
a
beer
like
this
very
nice
rust
colored
brown
head
goes
away
quickly
flavors
are
very
hard
to
discern
tastes
like
smokey
oranges
for
lack
of
a
better
term
paulaner
is
definetly
at
the
top
of
its
craft
i
dont
know
what
i
can
add
about
this
classic
but
i
can
say
that
i
like
it
well
constructed
easy
to
drink
tasteful
with
a
clean
finish
sweet
and
spicy
malt
flavors
come
through
primarily
with
a
touch
of
hops
for
dryness
nothing
sloppy
about
this
beer
good
show
a
clear
sparkling
bronze
brew
with
good
head
retention
and
lace
an
initial
sweet
carmel
malt
that
ends
with
a
hint
ot
toastiness
enough
hop
bitterness
and
some
length
to
make
this
fest
quite
balanced
and
hence
drinkable
can
see
this
as
having
some
session
possiblities
my
third
fest
so
far
and
the
best
of
the
three
another
oktoberfest
soon
it
will
be
time
for
the
winter
seasonals
anyway
pours
a
orangered
amber
with
a
taut
white
head
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
some
leafy
hops
not
as
sweet
smelling
as
other
marzens
taste
is
mild
with
caramel
malts
with
a
mellow
sweet
undertone
and
hops
on
the
finish
not
as
sweet
as
other
octoberfest
beers
and
pretty
tasty
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
oktoberfest
beers
and
as
i
said
very
drinkable
all
the
way
ouch
i
remember
this
being
much
better
and
much
more
substantial
nice
reddish
hue
but
head
disappears
quickly
little
lace
stunningly
thin
mouthfeel
quite
watery
i
remebered
this
beer
being
creamier
and
maltier
maybe
paulaner
is
being
dumbed
down
as
some
have
suggested
i
was
so
disappointed
i
couldnt
drink
two
reminded
me
of
a
yuengling
lager
in
a
way
some
mild
hoppiness
and
bite
but
almost
too
little
to
notice
where
is
the
malt
not
really
bad
but
just
too
thin
and
mild
i
hope
i
can
find
a
better
octoberfest
before
the
season
is
over
i
was
eager
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
did
not
disappoint
at
all
nice
deep
caramel
color
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
in
the
mug
aroma
is
subtle
and
mostly
sweet
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
and
light
toasted
malts
dominate
the
taste
the
toastyroasty
notes
come
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
really
make
for
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beer
a
light
to
medium
body
provides
for
a
high
drinkability
and
helps
when
quaffing
a
liter
at
a
time
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
smooth
clean
malty
aftertaste
nicely
balanced
highly
drinkable
beer
that
i
perceive
to
be
the
benchmark
for
the
style
amongst
those
available
in
the
u
s
one
of
the
sweeter
and
hoppier
märzens
ive
had
im
starting
to
notice
a
phantom
alcoholic
flavor
and
more
and
more
toasted
malt
as
i
reach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
carbonation
makes
its
presence
known
in
a
very
good
way
a
very
sweet
and
very
solid
oktoberfest
i
wish
that
parade
of
beer
maids
would
march
out
of
the
label
and
into
my
living
room
not
sure
how
long
i
would
enjoy
the
acrid
kind
of
aftertaste
but
its
an
easy
sixer
to
take
care
of
and
more
enjoyable
than
the
hofbrau
octoberfest
terriffic
example
of

a

oh
so
drinkable
lovely
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
tasted
thus
far
this
fall
but
there
are
plenty
more
to
go
beer
has
a
nice
toasted
bread
and
malt
aroma
taste
is
equally
yummy
definite
toasted

sweetness
you
also
get
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
nice
subdued

taste
clear
use

quality
ingredients
beer
is
smooth
and
carbonation
seems
to
be
perfectly
calibrated
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
went
great
with
the
thuringer
and
kraut
i
had
another
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
sample
at
the
munich
oktoberfest
and
one
that
travels
well
to
the
states
the
taste
is
a
wonderfully
tasty
mix
of
slightly
toasty
malt
sweetness
light
tealike
astringency
and
a
flowery
and
bitter
hop
prescence
all
blending
towards
a
deliciously
balanced
and
lingering
finish
as
of
now
my
top
german
ofest
reccomended
this
version
was
served
through
the
jockey
box
at
ludwigs
oktoberfest
street
party
poured
a
very
attractive
copper
amber
orange
with
a
thinning
white
head
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
fest
beers
that
ive
tried
its
sweet
malty
and
very
smooth
there
are
some
definite
spicy
notes
almost
peppery
with
a
bit
of
citrus
tang
lagered
perfectly
beautiful
melding
of
the
malt
and
hops
into
a
very
smooth
and
a
very
drinkable
product
and
at
the
same
time
retains
some
of
its
spicy
and
distinctive
character
excellent
pours
pure
clear
amber
with
a
large
tan
head
that
mostly
diminishes
and
leaves
little
lace
aroma
of
caramel
and
toasted
grains
flavor
starts
sweet
with
caramel
some
hints
of
toasted
bread
and
a
bit
of
smoke
squeezing
in
at
the
end
medium
body
super
easy
to
drink
a
truly
great
fest
beer
notes
definitely
a
topnotch
festbier
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
ive
been
enjoying
paulaner
ofests
for
the
past
10
years
and
this
year
2003
for
the
first
time
i
seem
to
notice
a
difference
less
sweet
hoppier
and
a
bit
more
alcohol
kick
it
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
and
holds
a
thin
beige
head
a
sweet
caramel
sweet
malt
and
hop
aroma
lasts
for
a
while
then
fades
the
malty
body
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
toffee
and
honey
flavors
the
hops
have
a
limelike
bitterness
and
mild
spiciness
slightly
astringent
and
some
noticeable
alcohol
which
lasts
throughout
the
slick
creamy
oily
liquidity
is
representative
of
oktoberfest
beers
this
years
paulaner
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
intense
than
pervious
years
versions
bring
on
fall
dark
gold
color
large
head
foamy
malty
aroma
a
medium
bodied
marzen
mild
malts
slightly
sweet
some
hoppyness
mild
flavor
smooth
and
mild
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
it
a
nice
oktoberfest
marzen
nice
but
nothing
special
a
deep
copper
color
that
produced
a
sizable
head
which
shrunk
to
nothing
very
quickly
aroma
is
a
malty
nutty
one
with
a
sweetness
and
a
slight
roasty
aroma
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
ample
carbonation
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
dryness
at
the
finish
there
is
no
retention
here
at
all
nothing
dissapointing
for
paulaner
a
small
creamytan
noisy
foamy
head
sits
on
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
body
sweet
toffee
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
tangy
toffee
at
first
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
then
chocolate
and
malty
caramel
finish
is
disappearing
when
cold
but
the
toffee
and
chocolate
are
still
there
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
dark
tasting
but
light
bodied
until
it
warms
thats
when
it
really
matures
it
sweetens
and
gets
breadier
much
better
fantastic
i
have
always
considered
this
a
really
good
example
of
a
fest
beer
and
jump
on
it
when
its
out
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
pretty
nice
medium
headaroma
is
slightly
malty
and
toasted
but
faint
the
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
with
some
doughy
flavors
with
a
light
hoppiness
to
keep
it
from
getting
to
sweet
real
nice
beer
look
for
it
if
you
like
th
style
nice
coppery
appearance
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipated
slowly
light
maltyhoppy
aroma
with
an
interesting
taste
initially
it
felt
light
but
then
the
hops
kicked
in
to
give
it
a
nice
crispness
that
lasted
well
and
left
a
pleasing
aftertaste
mouthfeel
likewise
was
initially
light
then
more
robust
a
bit
like
a
mild
explosion
easy
and
pleasing
to
drink
especially
the
aftertaste
i
tried
the
paulaner
oktoberfest
marzen
yesterday
on
the
recommendation
of
my
local
package
store
owner
while
staring
at
the
case
of
many
oktoberfest
beers
to
choose
from
i
think
i
made
the
right
choice
the
paulaner
is
a
nice
dark
amberbrown
minimal
white
head
nose
of
very
sweet
malt
and
autumn
fruit
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
body
is
hearty
and
chock
full
of
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
pronounced
hop
presence
following
that
backs
off
quickly
lingering
flavors
of
pumpkin
spice
raisins
and
other
unidentifiable
spice
make
this
a
very
worthy
oktoberfest
beer
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
good
amber
to
savor
a
few
pints
of
ng
my
first
octoberfest
beer
of
the
season
a
decent
beer
which
has
piqued
my
curiosity
about
the
style
poured
a
glowing
transparent
bronze
with
gold
at
the
edges
had
a
soft
head
of
even
thin
foam
patchy
lace
but
nice
bits
of
stain
smelled
of
malt
with
a
moderate
sweetness
brought
to
a
better
level
with
an
addition
of
small
amounts
of
both
caramel
and
grainy
types
of
roasted
notes
tasted
of
barely
sweet
amber
malt
an
easy
middle
of
moderate
roastiness
and
a
good
bit
of
quality
bitterness
at
the
end
made
of
a
beautiful
blend
of
toast
and
lemon
flavors
finish
was
surprisingly
short
given
the
strong
bitter
near
the
end
very
fresh
and
appetizing
it
had
a
fair
mouthfeel
for
this
session
styled
beer
though
such
a
concern
is
mostly
an
afterthought
with
a
beer
like
this
which
is
a
good
thing
you
expect
a
balanced
but
full
ofest
from
such
a
good
brewery
and
you
get
it
a
definite
leader
in
the
category
notes
look
and
smell
superior
to
the
overall
taste
package
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
punchier
malt
presence
but
an
enjoyable
drink
nonetheless
another
paulaner
winner
this
is
another
of
their
products
tyhat
scores
highly
and
consistently
in
every
category
the
red
amber
body
carries
a
cream
colored
head
but
it
does
not
leave
quite
as
much
lace
as
the
head
would
predict
nonetheless
it
is
able
and
willing
to
please
the
nose
is
of
malt
mostly
caramelly
and
with
slight
toasted
hints
the
flavor
is
deliciously
built
on
the
nice
carmel
malt
base
and
has
distinct
crispness
added
to
the
full
and
smooth
body
definitely
drinkable
i
love
the
label
and
the
web
site
is
hilarious
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
copper
colored
and
topped
with
an
offwhite
head
fruity
smell
of
sweet
pear
and
honey
flavor
is
sweet
consisting
of
light
malt
and
honey
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
there
is
a
tingle
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
dry
finish
with
an
offputting
metallic
aftertaste
this
beer
poured
a
head
with
large
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
amber
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
a
mild
aftertaste
was
observed
with
this
beer
i
enjoyed
this
brew
due
to
its
very
sweet
aroma
and
i
found
it
to
be
smooth
tasting
which
is
very
much
to
my
liking
unlike
those
brews
that
taste
like
strong
coffee
this
is
a
brew
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
all
night
at
a
bar
or
party
this
one
has
been
dubbed
the
1
oktoberfest
in
the
world
cant
say
too
much
to
back
that
up
because
the
only
other
one
ive
had
is
sam
adams
it
was
in
a
nice
1
gallon
keg
can
a
pretty
dark
syrupcolored
beer
i
liked
the
taste
fairly
spicy
with
a
nice
level
of
maltyness
to
it
something
i
will
have
again
this
was
the
fire
sale
beer
at
the
flying
saucer
i
have
to
say
this
was
the
best
fire
sale
in
a
long
time
the
draught
octoberfest
poured
a
clear
rich
amber
with
a
pretty
good
head
the
head
left
a
lot
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
had
just
finished
a
youngs
oatmeal
stout
but
the
maltiness
in
the
aroma
and
particularly
in
the
taste
was
well
formed
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
youngs
the
flavor
was
excellent
the
only
thing
i
mark
this
beer
down
for
was
it
mouthfeel
i
tought
it
had
a
very
light
mouthfeel
and
certainly
no
creaminess
this
is
a
good
beer
bordering
on
a
very
good
beer
i
would
recommend
anyone
trying
this
draught
beer
when
they
have
a
chance
i
liked
the
label
it
said
it
all
with
those
women
marching
down
the
street
it
poured
a
nice
darker
yellow
color
the
taste
was
pure
malt
but
not
a
bad
taste
it
was
rather
refreshing
to
have
a
overwhelming
malt
taste
like
this
and
not
be
repulsed
like
drinking
a
malt
liquier
i
enjoyed
this
beer
color
is
clear
amber
with
golden
yellow
tones
around
the
edge
and
bottom
some
white
head
that
left
patchy
lace
but
flatened
out
quickly
smell
is
faint
roasty
malt
with
a
hint
of
spicy
dry
hop
flavor
is
good
but
man
there
was
no
real
punch
i
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
it
seemed
very
empty
in
the
malt
it
wasnt
very
easy
to
swallow
for
some
reason
it
has
a
sweetish
malt
that
seemed
a
little
pushed
or
something
maybe
under
cooked
not
sure
what
it
was
but
it
sure
bothered
me
the
feel
too
was
empty
and
watery
it
has
a
drying
quality
but
seemed
to
light
to
me
it
was
ok
i
so
wanted
more
from
this
it
was
a
letdown
this
is
my
first
marzen
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
if
they
are
all
like
this
i
like
em
this
was
my
first
time
with
this
beer
and
i
will
probably
steer
clear
of
it
from
now
on
its
not
offensive
just
not
great
very
nice
aroma
mild
and
nonoffensive
it
poured
a
nice
frothy
head
with
a
mixture
of
medium
and
fine
bubbles
like
i
expect
for
a
good
german
brew
its
body
was
a
very
pretty
dark
brownamber
color
very
clear
in
its
consistency
the
head
soon
died
off
though
leaving
a
nice
lacing
around
the
rim
of
my
glass
it
tasted
a
little
of
carbonation
with
a
slight
after
taste
but
all
in
all
a
very
mild
smooth
brew
one
i
could
sit
and
drink
all
night
long
a
well
balanced
fest
beer
maltier
than
most
which
i
enjoy
and
very
smooth
and
refreshing
the
amber
colro
along
with
th
smell
of
hops
in
the
nose
is
an
excellent
coupling
with
the
malty
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
be
hughly
drinkable
i
think
around
5
8
so
grab
a
pretzel
and
a
wurst
and
enjoy
this
delicious
oktoberfest
beer
i
recall
a
print
ad
where
a
cartoon
duck
embraces
a
bottle
to
declare
we
go
great
together
this
probably
matches
any
meal
well
quite
nice
very
pleasant
allinall
doubtless
a
very
drinkable
one
year
round
even
this
marzen
amber
poured
an
orange
amber
color
with
no
head
or
lace
that
was
the
bad
side
of
it
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
was
very
inviting
to
the
next
step
of
tasting
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
bitterness
that
was
well
balanced
to
make
this
beer
complete
a
little
bitter
but
smooth
on
the
finish
that
made
this
beer
pleasant
enough
to
drink
again
and
again
and
again
pours
a
clear
and
bright
orange
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
nose
is
fresh
grass
and
grains
with
some
floral
hops
in
the
background
sweet
malts
and
lightly
toasted
grains
are
present
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
hops
very
nice
full
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
crisp
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
on
the
market
clear
brown
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
that
i
have
ever
had
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
as
it
should
be
the
taste
is
much
the
same
sweet
and
malty
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
the
ending
is
dry
with
a
hint
of
caramel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
have
many
of
and
would
really
like
to
sample
this
on
tap
at
oktoberfest
nice
clear
brownamber
color
decent
white
head
malty
caremel
aroma
sweet
malty
caremel
roasty
flavor
medium
body
some
musty
flavors
a
good
oktoberfest
i
think
its
the
only
one
avalible
year
round
pours
with
an
amber
color
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
delivers
much
of
what
the
aroma
forecasts
for
some
reason
i
think
of
walnut
flavor
and
aroma
when
i
drink
this
this
would
fit
in
well
for
drinking
a
few
pints
at
oktoberfest
sweet
light
and
easily
drinkable
i
think
for
this
style
the
rating
would
be
more
like
a
4
5
although
there
are
vienna
style
lagers
or
other
oktoberfests
that
are
close
this
might
be
a
good
bridge
beer
for
some
who
are
only
used
to
pilsners
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
retreated
to
about
14
inch
after
a
couple
of
minutes
subtle
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweet
middle
followed
a
mild
malt
finish
dryness
prevalent
in
the
finish
body
seemed
a
bit
watery
for
an
oktoberfest
but
overall
a
fine
brew
not
too
bad
from
the
minikeg
id
get
this
again
for
sure
when
it
comes
around
again
next
september
bottle
labelled
as
an
ale
strange
to
me
must
be
a
regulatory
thing
and
not
accurate
also
found
0703
on
the
label
assuming
that
is
a
best
before
date
fantastic
achievement
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
euro
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
the
head
is
beige
in
color
vast
in
size
oodles
of
lace
that
last
till
the
end
of
the
glass
aroma
of
the
malt
and
the
brewers
art
are
in
the
nose
clean
and
fresh
start
is
sweet
the
middle
light
the
finish
is
fastidiously
hopped
temperately
acidic
the
aftertaste
dry
and
pleasant
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
fall
as
with
several
other
oktoberfest
marzens
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
on
a
copper
body
the
aroma
is
fabulous
with
sweet
floral
smells
and
a
hint
of
spices
reminiscent
of
nutmeg
the
head
leaves
a
light
lace
on
the
glass
the
flavor
is
very
rewarding
sweetness
balanced
wonderfully
by
hop
bitterness
this
is
my
favorite
ofest
by
far
it
feels
good
from
the
time
you
take
the
first
sip
to
till
you
finish
the
last
drink
which
could
be
sevral
hours
and
several
beers
down
the
road
definitely
need
a
case
of
this
next
year
finally
an
oktoberfest
beer
that
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
compromise
flavor
or
aroma
for
drinkability
this
one
goes
in
my
personal
top
ten
best
ofest
clear
dark
amber
medium
head
and
minimal
lace
aroma
to
die
for
munich

oh
baby
what
a
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
marzenoktoberfest
style
but
this
brew
transcends
all
styles
and
should
be
respected
as
a
classic
great
looking
rich
copper

also
bounce

everything
that
is
expected
nice

especially
on

medium

very
drinkable
great
with
hearty
fall
meals
or
as
a
treat
alone
very
good
for
the
style
a
really
good
beer
nice
color
sandylooking
head
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
the
flavor
is
nice
malty
caramelly
and
sweet
mouthfeel
has
surprising
body
to
it
there
are
some
esters
to
the
flavor
or
maybe
im
picking
up
something
else
copper
redorange
body
topped
with
a
oneinch
solid
offwhite
head
but
it
does
disipate
too
quickly
malt
sweetness
dominates
nose
but
there
is
a
touch
of
herbal
hoppiness
there
is
a
good
earthiness
to
the
taste
wonderful
caramel
snap
as
it
first
hits
the
tongue
while
malt
is
the
dominate
aspect
it
has
a
depth
of
taste
beyond
being
simply
sweet
while
the
hops
are
secondary
they
achieve
a
good
balance
overall
goes
down
easily
but
memorably
year
after
year
one
of
my
favorite
imports
copper
color
with
thin
head
delectable
aroma
with
hints
of
cedar
and
smoke
malts
are
fine
substantial
and
a
little
bit
raw
which
is
part
of
the
appeal
hops
dont
give
much
dryness
or
kick
in
the
finish
but
what
they
offer
is
true
perfection
in
terms
of
spiciness
said
spiciness
is
the
true
draw
of
a
marzen
in
my
book
this
has
it
in
spades
while
the
malts
are
sweet
and
sticky
this
beer
is
actually
quite
light
to
drink
and
could
be
offered
to
more
trepidatious
less
experienced
beer
tasters
be
absolutely
certain
to
let
it
warm
up
you
are
doing
yourself
an
injustice
if
you
drink
it
too
cool
this
is
the
quintessential
oktoberfest
beer
for
me
maybe
not
the
highest
marks
but
it
is
the
most
utilitarian
paulaner
oktoberfest
märzen
amber
draft
is
drinkable
in
the
extreme
this
is
one
fine
beer
dieses

feines
bier
clear
deep
amber
with
an
orange
cast
topped
by
a
cream
colored
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
vienna
malts
the
body
is
medium
with
a
standard
carbonation
level
the
flavor
is
richly
toasty
backed
by
a
brisk
bitterness
it
has
a
bready
quality
that
is
not
unlike
the
almost
burnt
crust
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
some
dark
toffee
notes
are
revealed
only
to
be
quickly
ushered
away
by
a
spicy
hop
flavor
there
is
an
underlying
fruitiness
that
includes
some
apple
grape
and
plum
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lightly
lingering
spicy
hop
very
well
balanced
alternating
between
a
lightly
sweet
malt
and
a
crisp
bitterness
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
all
in
all
this
ofest
is
tops
in
my
book
my
favorite
fest
so
far
this
year
great
color
orange
amber
with
hints
of
red
good
head
fades
but
laces
well
sweet
smell
in
the
aroma
and
taste
caramel
almost
candy
slight
hops
noted
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
big
malt
taste
truely
a
great
example
of
the
style
obviously
theyve
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time
my
bartender
was
puzzled
because
i
kept
with
the
same
beer
for
more
than
two
a
consistently
great
example
of
the
marzen
style
amberorange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stays
around
for
several
minutes
then
almost
disappears
sweet
caramel
and
toasty
biscuit
malt
aroma
with
spicy
hops
as
for
the
taste
very
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
are
balanced
well
by
the
hops
and
the
carbonation
toasted
biscuity
malt
in
the
background
and
in
the
aftertaste
spicy
and
crisp
hop
bitterness
is
present
especially
in
the
back
which
is
very
nice
tastes
almost
like
a
minidoppelbock
great
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
excellent
märzen
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
the
only
thing
it
needs
is
better
head
retention
this
is
an
octoberfest
that
could
surely
improve
my
impression
of
the
style
lovely
amber
color
with
a
dense
creamy
head
roasted
malt
nutty
and
a
surprisingly
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
fresh
tasting
with
vibrant
but
appropriate
carbonation
i
was
wishing
for
a
liter
sized
mug
of
this
my
favorite
so
far
of
the
ofest
offerings
prosit
im
confused
that
it
says
ale
on
the
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
ale
to
me
but
who
knows
a
treat
that
can
be
quaffed
as
easily
as
it
can
be
savored
break
out
the
bigass
3l
mugs
it
is
that
time
of
year
known
as
the
1
oktoberfest
and
i
can
see
why
beautiful
amber
color
and
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
an
explosion
of
taste
as
this
beers
enters
the
mouth
sweet
caramel
with
a
nice
hop
bite
this
beer
is
a
clear
copper
color
a
thin
beige
head
sits
on
top
of
it
it
has
a
nice
malty
nose
pretty
clean
taste
about
medium
to
full
in
body
toasted
malt
seems
to
be
the
dominant
taste
husky
grains
are
apparant
as
well
one
aspect
is
a
bit
disappointing
on
the
pallate
a
slight
offflavor
a
bad
bitterness
coupled
with
a
slightly
soapy
aftertaste
it
isnt
overbearing
but
definitely
there
this
is
the
second
german
octoberfest
ive
been
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
year
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
tanish
head
that
sinks
a
little
too
quickly
smell
has
a
nice
toasty
slightly
husky
malt
aroma
to
it
with
some
nice
noble
hop
aroma
as
well
great
toasty
malt
flavors
are
almost
perfectly
balanced
by
the
excellent
low
level
bitterness
provided
by
the
hops
the
brew
has
just
enough
body
and
is
rather
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
is
probably
my
favorite
so
far
for
this
years
marzens
tis
the
season
for
oktoberfest
brews
and
this
is
my
first
of
2002
pours
with
a
golden
orange
color
and
a
frothy
head
that
leaves
but
a
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
bready
german
malts
also
has
a
hint
of
candy
sugar
the
smooth
body
supports
a
lightly
sweet
bready
flavor
with
a
bold
sharp
hop
profile
creating
a
very
nice
balance
very
tasty
i
will
start
right
out
and
admit
that
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
it
is
a
gorgeous
pour
with
a
nice
amber
color
topped
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
malt
dominated
with
a
warm
caramel
aroma
lingering
above
the
hop
spiciness
the
tast
is
why
i
love
this
beer
a
full
explosive
malt
flavor
dominated
with
rich
caramel
and
subtle
hops
spiciness
lingering
in
the
mouth
when
the
first
hints
of
fall
are
in
the
air
i
could
come
back
to
this
rich
and
flavorfull
beer
again
and
again
now
if
only
i
could
sample
the
paulaner
oktoberfest
in
germany
a
good
oktober
but
i
remember
it
being
much
better
last
year
out
of
the
pint
bottle
a
nice
amber
pour
moves
on
to
a
slightly
bitter
brew
that
is
smooth
and
a
good
drinker
not
the
best
oktober
i
have
had
but
it
is
a
fine
brew
amber
in
color
with
moderate
white
head
that
lingers
the
aroma

spiced
malt
with
some
breadyeast
thrown
in
the
taste
however
was

then
malt
then
more
spices
with
a

it
was
smooth
and

my
first
experience
with
a
marzen
and
i
am
excited
for
more

from
carbonation

it

of

thats
my
only
problem
but
its
kind
of
nit
picking
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
gold
color
and
formed
a
white
head
that
left
some
lace
an
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
was
of
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
was
light
with
a

of
tangy

a
good
beer
what
can
i
say
this
brew
smells
and
feels
so
damn
good
i
want
to
bathe
in
it
err
anyway
it
tastes
solid
too
i
can

fantisize
about

do
this
and
do
it

i
sensed
a

to
the

still
a
nice

i
enjoy
this
style
much
more
since
my
original

the
only
change
decreases
the

only
to
prevent
overbearing

and
does
that
well
finishes
with
a

dry

sweetness
this
widely
available
and
fine
brew
is
quite
comparable
to
spatens
octoberfest
and
definitely
worth
a
try
think
of
it
as
a
salvator
light
all
in
all
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
dark
amber
in
color
malty
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
taste
very
easy
to
drink
ive
had
it
in
bottles
and
in
those
little
2
12
gallon
kegs
and
the
little
kegs
were
slightly
better
maybe
a
little
fresher
when
we
tried
one
62
the
amber
standard
for
a
nice
full
and
malty
oktoberfest
ive
never
been
let
down
by
paulaner
it
defines
the
style
though
a
few
others
are
just
as
good
in
my
mind
definite
sense
of
toast
rather
than
sweet
malts
true
to
the
style
very
pleasing
malty
aroma
full
somewhat
creamy
head
that
thins
then
becomes
lacey
bright
and
clear
with
amber
color
nice
malt
characteristics
throughout
with
slight
roast
and
caramel
taste
hops
noted
in
its
little
dryness
and
taste
slightly
in
finish
but
never
more
than
the
malt
medium
mouth
feel
with
a
grainy
quality
ive
always
considered
this
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
ok
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
one
and
the
blance
was
perfect
but
my
overall
impression
is
that
the
flavor
intensity
was
low
it
seems
to
me
if
they
took
the
total
flavor
profile
and
cranked
it
up
a
notch
or
two
it
would
kick
ass
now
the
one
i
had
was
a
little
old
so
i
reserve
the
right
to
change
my
mind
after
i
try
a
fresh
one
when
i
do
i
will
edit
my
review
appropriately
nicely
balanced
beer
sweet
pleasant
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
500ml
bottle
0715
pours
a
bright
pale
straw
colour
with
a
frothy
slightly
off
white
head
which
refused
to
disappear
and
excellent
lacing
very
gentle
aroma
of
malt
and
only
a
hint
of
hops
light
sweetness
and
light
bitterness
very
clean
medium
body
smooth
texture
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
very
complex
but
subtle
well
made
and
a
perilously
drinkable
brew
at
6
abv
i
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
as
its
not
a
beer
to
be
pondered
and
dissected
its
a
beer
to
be
simply
enjoyed
a
very
good
oktoberfest
smooth
tasty
and
refreshing
i
had
no
idea
these
guys
did
a
wheated
octoberfest
so
glad
they
do
its
amazingly
tasty
and
a
wonderful
contrast
to
all
the
marzel
lagers
going
right
now
this
one
is
pale
straw
colored
with
a
lovely
inch
and
a
half
of
white
head
that
tries
but
cant
hang
on
way
more
clear
than
other
german
wheat
beers
the
nose
is
sweet
from
the
wheat
uncovered
by
the
yeast
like
i
expected
it
to
be
quite
delicate
for
its
6
abv
and
rather
robustly
grain
forward
there
is
an
apple
nose
too
and
it
comes
through
in
the
taste
especially
in
the
finish
almost
like
cider
meets
wheat
beer
the
yeast
is
interesting
with
some
fruitiness
but
super
dry
at
the
end
the
wheat
adds
a
lot
to
this
traditional
style
really
ramping
it
up
to
something
that
feels
both
distinct
and
historic
the
germans
still
do
some
clever
stuff
and
they
probably
deserve
a
little
more
credit
among
american
beer
geeks
for
beers
like
this
one
its
really
tasty
richer
in
feel
but
still
dry
and
airy
from
the
carbonation
it
just
feels
like
fall
far
better
than
the
regular
paulaner
oktoberfest
although
i
like
that
one
too
ive
had
a
lot
of
paulaner
but
this
is
surely
one
of
their
standouts
sulfury
on
the
nose
just
how
i
like
my
lagers
still
being
a
german
pale
lager
it
doesnt
smell
like
much
medium
bodied
noble
hops
are
evident
mainly
at
the
end
and
add
a
lingering
flavor
overall
i
would
get
this
again
a
very
smooth
take
and
still
very
toasty
and
bready

flavor

up
for
it

in

only
with

compare
it
to

if
you
cant
find
this
one
worth
a

and
i
will
buy
it
again
this
one
will
be
in
the
late
sept
through
november
beer
rotation
at
the
uniobrew
household
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
and
the

is
well
hidden
with
a
mild
sessionable
flavor
hence
the
sneaky

being
hung
on
this

down
smell
is
of

taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
super
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
defiantly
gonna
be
picking
more
although
a
little
pricey
you
pay
what
you
get
for
a
great
tasting
fall
beer
you
could
enjoy
with
your
bros
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malty
goodness
taste
smooth
a
bit
of
that
sweet
aroma
coming
through
on
your
palate
almost
fruity
crisp
finish
a
wonderful
oktoberfest
i
could
drink
this
beer
everyday
i
enjoyed
this
outside
on
a
cool
evening
with
the
smell
of
fall
in
the
air
absolutely
perfect
o
i
love
its
complexity
but
prefer
its
bolder
brother
paulaner
oktoberfestmärzen
by
far
prost
overall
very
nice
true
to
german
pilsner
nice
grainy
straw
malt
husky
like
almost
grassy
very
good
malty
character
and
great
decoction
layers
which
i
wish
i
could
have
a
lot
more
often
and
a
nice
light
mild
bitter
hop
character
to
go
with
it
much
maltier
than
typical
pilsner
so
more
in
the
marzen
line
but
not
even
a
touch
of
munich
malt
i
think
tasty
and
well
done
o
awesome
german
lager
if
i
had
the
opportunity
i
would
drink
several
glasses
of
this
and
love
every
second
having
said
that
this
does
not
resemble
a
marzenoktoberfest
as
the
style
suggests
as
the
color
is
wrong
and
this
beer
does
not
highlight
the
strong
malt
body
and
flavor
that
oktoberfest
is
known
for
much
more
like
a
strong
helles
whatever
it
is
i
love
it
but
around
67
a
can
my
consumption
will
be
limited
my
rating
of
this
beer
is
based
more
as
a
helles
rather
than
an
oktoberfest
although
the
style
characteristics
are
off
this
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
while
lacking
complex
flavors
this
oktoberfest
brew
was
just
a
highly
drinkable
brew
as
far
as
what
you
would
expect
if
you
were
in
germany
at
the
real
deal
i
kept
forgetting
this
was
6
abv
kudos
for
that
i
wish
i
had
a
brat
with
this
this
beer
is
limited
in
brewing
so
if
you
want
it
get
it
when
you
see
it
as
it
can
be
hard
to
find
that
being
said
it
pours
nicely
with
a
generous
head
into
a
beer
mug
the
foam
is
plentiful
a
presents
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
to
compliment
the
malty
aromas
the
beer
itself
is
light
and
refreshing
with
more
of
a
hoppy
taste
than
expected
from
the
taste
of
the
foam
is
this
a
yummy
beer
absolutely
but
is
this
beer
super
delicious
not
really
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
an
excellent
beer
one
would
expect
from
a
pricey
limited
edition
paulaner
grab
a
can
if
you
have
not
had
it
but
do
not
grab
more
than
one
honestly
cant
believe
this
is
6
alcohol
its
very
water
very
thin
but
i
suppose
its
ok
i
wouldnt
pay
the
prices
they
charge
for
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden

with
large

nothing

side
of
things
glad
i
got
the
monstrous
glass
with
it

a
decent
drinking
beer
but
i
would
want
a
bit
more
on
the
appearance

nice
flavor
and
something
to
drink
by
the
liter
poured
thh
one
liter
can
into
the
free
glass
that
came
with
beer
for
a
clearish
dark
gold
beer
with
voluminous
head
that
left
some
lace
patches
down
the
mug
as
i
drank
not
really
a
medicinal
or
aluminum
type
smell
although
the
hops
take
on
a
distinct
earthy
and
grassy
note
hops
are
the
smell
for
this
beer
although
some
light
citric
notes
in
the
hops
as
well
as
touches
of
bready
sweet
malt
make
an
appearance
like
an
good
german
bier
this
brew
is
lightbodied
and
easy
to
drink
with
the
dominant
taste
being
the
sharp
hoppy
bite
the
hops
are
like
they
smell
earthy
and
dry
and
are
balanced
not
so
much
from
any
citric
hops
there
are
some
but
also
from
a
moderate
usage
of
breadbarley
malts
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
shines
through
here
and
there
this
easy
to
drinkness
as
it
were
makes
this
not
only
a
good
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
but
also
easy
to
keep
drinking
which
might
be
the
point
since
its
an
oktoberfest
bier
a
little
pricey
but
you
get
a
souvenier
for
your
bucks
o
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
making
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
last
year
and
couldnt
pass
up
the
big
glorious
1
l
can
this
year
first
dont
expect
a
traditional
oktoberfestmaerzen
this
is
more
of
an
amped
up
helles
really
more
akin
to
what
is
being
served
at
the
real
deal
in
munich
pours
into

a
clear

soft
warm
cereals
matched
with
a
pleasant
fresh
grassy
hop
character
lemon
rind
hay
green
peppercorn
and
meadow
grass
perfectly
balanced
and
meant
to
be
drunk
by
the
liter
overall
delicious
not
perfect
but
close
to
what
i
was
anticipating
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
pale
but
rich
golden
hue
with
a
puffy
white
head
its
quite
transparent
appearance
is
aided
by
drinking
it
out
of
a
maß
hard
not
to
enjoy
looking
at
a
beautiful
liter
glass
aroma
is
sweet
light
malt
with
spicy
noble
hops
i
feel
like
i
should
be
in
a
beer
hall
in
munich
the
taste
is
clean
and
sweet
theres
a
decent
dose
of
hops
particularly
in
the
finish
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
this
liter
is
going
quickly
a
very
well
made
beer
that
evinces
a
sure
brewing
hand
and
heaps
of
tradition
that
said
its
also
rather
boring
but
thats
hardly
a
fault
all
in
all
this
beer
is
as
german
as
apfelkuchen
overall
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
this
beer
is
just
made
to
drink
liters
and
liters
of
under
a
tent
during
oktoberfest
an
extremely
tasty
and
quaffable
beer
overall
this
is
a
rare
gem
as
stated
previously
grab
this
beer
if
you
have
a
chance
but
have
it
either
from
the
can
or
on
draught
brilliant
either
way
overall
this
was
the
first
time
i
have
tried
paulaners
oktoberfest
weisn
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
would
love
to
see
them
offer
it
every
septemberoctober
as
an
alternative
to
their
oktoberfest
marzen
this
was
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
fall
i
will
stock
up
on
this
while
i
can
and
will
have
something
to
look
forward
to
during
the
cooler
fall
months
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
it
is
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
it
is
the
most
similar
to
beers
sold
at
oktoberfest
in
munich
and
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
being
at
oktoberfest
in
munich
without
having
to
buy
a
plane
ticket
prost
o
this
beer
is
good
not
great
simple
and
focuses
on
a
few
tastes
the
other
great
thing
is
i
could
use
the
mug
to
take
out
any
intruder
that
makes
their
way
into
my
home
overall
a
fine
gift
overall
a
nice
affordable
german
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
but
nothing
incredibly
unique
hides
the
6
0
abv
well
o
this
is
the
stuff
they
drink
under
a
tent
in
munich
during
a
festival
you
may
have
heard
of
paulaner
original
with
more
aroma
hops
o
a
chap
in
another
review
said
he
could
go
either
way
with
this
one
and
i
know
what
he
means
its
metallicy
but
theres
a
bit
of
class
going
on
in
the
background
very
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
smooth
crisp
and
drying
overall
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
for
casual
drinking
my
local
store
had
the
1l
canbeer
mug
combo
pack
on
sale
so
i
picked
one
up
mainly
for
the
glass
freshness
date
best
by
end
of
feb
2012
but
i
dont
mind
poured
into
0
5l
mugs
to
split
with
my
wife
very
light
yellow
colored
body
but
a
very
huge
white
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
was
neutral
which
was
fine
knowing
this
beer
wasnt
the
freshest
taste
was
good
light
malt
body
with
a
clean
crisp
aftertaste
a
bit
surprised
to
see
the
abv
at
6
so
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
a
fun
purchase
that
was
worth
it
a
big
ol
can
in
a
big
ol
glass
i
can
smell
the
gemutlicht
from
here
pours
a
goldent
color
with
a
big
ol
white
foamy
head
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
mustache
smells
earthy
and
of
bananas
and
a
whole
lotta
good
taste
is
even
better
slightly
nutty
slight
banana
a
hint
of
sweet
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
buttery
this
is
a
great
marzen
a
great
wheat
beer
and
just
a
wonderful
refreshing
drink
daddy
like
i
like
this
beer
because
its
a
quality
beer
thats
unique
and
its
a
nice
change
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
once
in
a
while
its
really
nice
to
have
one
body
is
medium
in
heft
with
moderate
carbonation
creating
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
at
first
which
transitions
to
smooth
as
the
carbonation
disperses
across
the
palate
finish
is
semidry
this
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
dark
straw
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
diminished
to
just
a
skim
the
aroma
is
mediumhigh
malt
sweet
grainy
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
a
bit
grainy
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
any
hop
presence
is
very
subtle
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
balance
the
sweet
malt
combined
with
the
dry
finish
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
overall
a
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
brew
decent
this
beer
is
soooo
drinkable
a
perfect
session
beer
for
oktoberfest
from
the
1
quart
can
stamped
052011022012
sampled
on
march
8
2012
this
is
one
big
can
of
beer
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
moderate
carbonation
that
extends
to
a
huge
foamy
white
head
german
malts
are
on
the
nose
along
with
yeast
the
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
pretty
much
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
also
brings
forth
the
malty
yeasty
character
but
then
there
is
a
notable
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
this
is
one
of
those
oktoberfest
beers
that
would
really
be
fun
to
try
during
oktberfest
this
beer
wasnt
bad
and
rather
refreshing
and
is
fairly
drinkable
d
this
is
a
really
easydrinking
beer
especially
at
6
abv
and
id
be
very
happy
to
see
this
on
paulaners
regular
lineup
pretty
good
but
not
much
personality
liter
can
i
picked
up
at
trader
joes
but
the
picture
on
the
label
was
more
interesting
than
the
beer
imo
so
maybe
i
was
pulled
in
by
the
marketing
i
guess
i
expected
more
hops
and
flavor
from
a
german
beer
especially
a
paulaner
oktoberfest
offering
and
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
fit
with
the
classification
assigned
to
it
not
bad
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
or
spend
big
bucks
on
this
one
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
not
very
complex
this
is
what
bmc
types
ought
to
aspire
to
a
highquality
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
a
broad
base
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
would
recommend
to
all
its
not
perfect
but
it
is
done
just
right
fyi
just
incase
you
didnt
know
this
is
my
number
three
marzen
that
doesnt
mean
that
it
is
bad
just
keep
them
coming
salud
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
great
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
simple
but
earthy
and
full
flavor
is
a
robust
malt
with
slightly
sweet
and
woody
notes
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
wonderful
beer
got
it
as
a
christmas
present
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
good
the
massive
can
treated
me
this
brew
was
alright
i
have
to
say
it
was
a
little
disappointing
for
my
first
paulaner
honestly
i
really
just
picked
this
up
for
the
dimpled
mug
that
was
included
overall
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
touch
of
honeylike
sweetness
in
the
finish
of
every
sip
the
hardest
part
of
drinking
this
beer
is
lifting
this
huge
litersized
glass
mug
over
and
over
again
thankfully
it
keeps
getting
lighter
with
each
gulp
prosit
it
could
be
the
serving
vessel
partially
but
this
is
a
nice
light
drinkable
beer
exactly
like
what
american
macros
should
be
shooting
for
instead
of
the
bland
stuff
theyre
churning
out
a
lighter
ockotberfest
very
easy
drinking
not
very
complex
in
flavor
but
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
due
to
its
drinkability
you
can
pound
this
nice
marketing
with
the
full
liter
can
very
nice
german
beer
but
not
nessacarily
what
have
come
to
expect
in
a
oktoberfest
t
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
but
its
actually
really
tasty
great
smooth
malt
flavor
throughout
with
a
nice
almond
meal
nuttiness
a
slight
touch
of
hops
and
then
a
sweet
grainy
and
cereal
malt
finish
infinitely
drinkable
o
not
bad
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
and
thankfully
theres
a
lot
here
i
wont
have
any
issues
splitting
this
one
tonight
overall
a
very
interesting
concept
and
one
that
id
like
to
see
more
german
breweries
taking
advantage
of
the
lightblocking
can
could
help
a
lot
of
sensitive
bavarian
styles
survive
the
voyage
across
the
ocean
better
refrigeration
should
be
mandatory
however
1l
can
poured
a
clear
golden
color
beer
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
is
not
the
best
with
light
notes
of
overcooked
vegetables
and
lightly
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
light
overcooked
vegetable
notes
with
some
light
malt
with
sweet
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
sure
if
this
is
really
what
people
drink
during
oktoberfest
but
i
sure
aint
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
again
o
very
good
oktoberfest
that
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
recommend
it
taste
starts
moderately
malty
bitter
hops
sizzle
in
the
middle
closes
with
revisit
of
sweet
and
a
lingering
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
good
stuff
glad
i
fell
for
the
marketing
ploy
and
got
a
glass
and
some
good
brew
not
bad
even
though
im
more
keen
with
my
marzens
being
darker
colored
there
are
worse
ways
to
spend
your
beer
money
than
adding
one
more
piece
of
glassware
to
your
collection
and
getting
a
one
off
tick
in
the
process
o
the
mug
is
a
nice
addition
to
my
glassware
collection
the
beer
is
average
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
crystal
clear
and
very
yellowish
with
some
decent
carbonation
the
body
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
thats
bubbly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
i
smell
some
malt
and
slight
citrus
aromas
but
not
much
else
the
beer
is
crisp
on
your
tongue
and
remains
crisp
throughout
the
tasting
it
a
light
to
medium
body
and
leaves
a
slight
alcohol
taste
in
your
mouth
i
picked
up
some
slight
spices
and
hops
some
wheat
flavors
did
come
through
its
mildly
sweet
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertatse
but
its
flavor
is
pretty
mild
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
and
quit
refreshing
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
and
so
very
drinkable
a
classic
highly
recommended
onot
bad
at
all
very
drinkable
and
a
refreshing
example
of
the
oktoberfest
style
overall
a
good
beer
it
is
what
oktoberfest
beers
are
meant
to
be
nice
and
consumable
in
a
1
liter
sized
mug
oh
yea
this
is
nice
sweet
grains
for
sure
but
it
is
so
amazing
at
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
and
balances
out
nicely
from
start
to
finish
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
comes
out
in
the
middle
to
help
dry
things
out
a
bit
after
having
the
hofbrau
light
oktofest
style
offering
more
than
a
few
times
i
was
expecting
something
akin
to
a
helles
but
this
delivers
much
more
malt
body
and
flavor
mmmm
tasty
im
already
halfway
through
the
liter
and
showing
absolutely
zero
signs
of
slowing
down
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
makes
you
wish
the
massproduced
lagers
in
the
us
tasted
this
freaking
delicious
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
marzenstyle
oktoberfests
so
good
in
fact
i
am
actually
thinking
about
buying
another
canglass
combo
just
for
the
beer
and
giving
the
glass
away
for
free
loved
it
served
in
a
giant
beer
stein
from
a
giant
can
appearance
is
light
golden
smells
strongly
of
bread
taste
some
bread
like
qualities
with
a
little
malt
kind
of
light
on
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
surprised
this
is
6
overall
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
i
bought
it
so
i
would
have
a
giant
glass
to
drink
beer
from
but
now
i
might
get
another
one
i
wish
i
could
get
this
year
round
here
i
like
this
a
lot
and
would
love
to
drink
many
liters
of
this
for
now
i
have
one
o
a
good
marzen
not
the
best
but
definitly
would
have
again
1l
can
pours
deep
golden
with
a
white
short
lived
head
and
lively
carbonation
nose
is
of
bready
malt
and
herbal
hops
body
is
medium
and
smooth
bready
malt
grain
and
light
noble
hops
fill
the
mouth
clean
grainyhoppy
finish
pleasant
session
brew
d
i
can
see
how
this
is
consumed
in
large
quantities
like
that
it
came
in
a
1l
can
o
not
a
bad
fest
it
was
nice
to
get
one
fairly
fresh
its
clear
though
that
regular
paulaner
oktoberfest
marzen
is
the
superior
brew
much
more
of
a
depth
of
character
it
looks
like
the
pale
lager
is
the
way
oktoberfests
are
going
i
know
why
for
mass
appeal
but
i
dont
like
it
drinks
easy
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
guess
its
a
good
one
for
all
those
endless
steins
but
not
for
a
ba
interested
in
flavor
i
dont
need
everything
to
be
huge
and
barrel
aged
but
gimme
something
to
work
with
please
picked
up
one
of
the
gift
packs
that
includes
a
1l
mug
with
the
can
inside
poured
said
can
into
said
mug
this
beer
was
brewed
on
may
20
2011
according
to
the
date
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
the
beer
pours
with
a
tall
bright
white
foamy
sudsy
head
that
starts
at
a
whopping
three
inches
in
this
huge
glass
and
then
slowly
settles
into
a
dense
clingy
head
the
beer
is
a
slighty
hazed
yellowgold
coloring
that
is
vibrant
and
almost
honey
colored
in
the
depths
the
beers
aromas
are
extremely
effervescent
with
a
blend
of
toasted
grains
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
background
presence
of
hops
noble
the
beer
has
a
very
light
and
smooth
blend
of
flavors
with
a
slight
tangy
malt
sweetness
a
toasty
quality
and
the
crisp
and
clean
characters
of
hops
sprinkled
around
the
end
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
has
a
honey
sweetness
and
tang
but
only
for
a
short
amount
of
time
as
the
hops
presence
cleans
your
tastebuds
for
a
clean
crisp
finish
i
was
impressed
how
clean
and
quick
the
finish
was
with
such
a
creamy
rich
and
round
body
good
brew
like
several
others
i
picked
up
the
1liter
can
packaged
with
the
traditional
octoberfest
seidel
glass
who
knows
if
ill
ever
get
to
munich
so
this
might
be
as
close
as
ill
get
the
first
pour
looks
great
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
atop
a
clear
sparkling
golden
brew
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
without
being
artificial
taste
is
nice
mostly
malt
and
bread
with
a
little
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
and
sweet
probably
good
for
the
style
bot
not
my
favorite
overall
the
big
liter
glass
was
good
at
reminding
me
i
need
to
work
out
to
drink
from
it
but
otherwise
it
was
very
enjoyable
saw
this
beer
in
a
giant
1
liter
can
packaged
inside
a
giant
seidel
glass
and
had
to
give
it
a
try
the
appearance
is
a
sort
of
golden
yellow
the
aroma
gives
off
some
floral
notes
but
nothing
extraordinary
however
i
was
blown
away
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
sweet
without
being
overpowering
full
bodied
without
being
heavy
and
incredibly
drinkable
now
i
understand
why
it
was
sold
by
the
liter
a
lighter
more
lagerlike
version
of
an
oktoberfest
but
still
enjoyable
on
a
late
summer
day
and
drinkable
enough
very
fine
overall
and
very
drinkable
at
6
the
whole
liter
produced
a
good
buzz
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
were
more
prominent
im
gonna
buy
another
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
isnt
cloying
because
it
is
balanced
off
enough
by
the
underlying
hops
ach
du
lieber
i
also
intended
to
recount
the
tale
of
erik
m
a
fellow
student
with
whom
i
grew
up
for
his
graduation
present
his
parents
sent
him
to
munich
for
oktoberfest
and
despite
all
of
our
underage
drinking
he
came
home
amazed
at
what
he
had
encountered
little
girls
were
drinking
me
under
the
table
and
i
could
barely
lift
my
glass
he
told
us
i
snickered
in
my
status
as
a
seagoing
sailor
but
in
my
age
i
know
where
he
was
coming
from
pours
a
rich
yellow
color
with
a
soapy
pure
white
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
doughy
german
malt
some
honey
grassy
and
peppery
hops
the
taste
is
of
the
sweet
doughy
munich
malt
light
grains
honey
touch
of
tin
and
some
grassy
and
peppery
hop
pretty
much
a
stronger
munich
helles
and
typical
festbier
the
body
is
moderate
with
semisoft
carbonation
sweet
overall
finishes
with
a
slight
peppery
hop
balance
comes
in
a
big
can
was
glad
to
try
this
beer
finally
pulled
the
trigger
on
the
cankrug
combo
almost
immediately
proud
of
the
decision
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
russetgoldenamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
lightly
toasted
wheat
bread
light
caramel
grass
and
a
touch
of
cashew
the
taste
drops
the
cashew
opting
instead
for
a
nice
blend
of
mandarin
orange
and
carameldripped
wheat
bread
with
some
grass
tossed
in
the
back
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
kinda
creamy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
ofest
one
i
kinda
wish
i
could
sample
in
munich
sometime
o
drinking
basically
three
beers
at
once
seemed
like
a
daunting
task
at
first
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
still
tastes
fine
as
it
warms
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
nicesized
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
bready
malt
and
some
grain
notes
not
too
much
going
on
but
nothing
offensive
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
bread
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
grass
from
the
hops
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
really
what
i
come
to
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
beer
but
you
have
to
like
the
packaging
which
includes
the
1l
can
and
1l
mug
for
a
nice
price
this
can
came
free
with
the
paulaner
oktoberfest
1
liter
mug
i
dont
think
id
pay
for
it
i
love
paulaner
pils
so
this
was
a
disappointment
smells
clean
crisp
and
sweet
you
can
really
smell
those
german
pale
malts
has
that
6row
macro
flavor
along
with
some
german
2row
pils
tastes
like
youre
eating
a
big
bowl
of
fresh
cut
grain
and
ripe
corn
soaked
in
sugar
has
a
rich
cereal
sweetness
to
it
more
wiesn
less
oktoberfest
it
actually
tastes
much
like
a
munich
helles
but
with
a
much
fuller
mouthfeel
a
quality
wellmade
beer
but
its
nothing
mindblowing
i
would
like
to
try
a
drier
and
thinner
version
i
think
i
would
really
enjoy
that
overall
a
very
solid
lager
even
though
its
different
than
a
typical
marzen
sweetness
and
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
dthis
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
had
ive
already
polished
off
12
l
in
about
5
minutes
need
i
say
more
a
new
favorite
for
me
especially
after
a
long
day
at
work
not
a
very
exciting
beer
but
at
least
i
got
another
liter
mug
out
of
it
this
pours
a
light
yellowish
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
smell
are
of
malts
earthy
grainy
a
little
grassy
hops
the
feel
is
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
malts
and
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
end
overall
this
was
a
pleasing
beer
the
can
is
gorgeous
the
beer
is
gorgeous
it
has
all
of
the
oktoberfest
qualities
i
like
i
love
this
time
of
the
season
i
pick
this
up
at
my
costco
it
came
with
a
huge
glass
and
in
a
can
that
is
36oz
i
had
to
pick
it
up
for
the
german
lager
glass
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
head
on
it
a
nice
white
head
sight
malty
taste
but
some
like
warsteiner
oktoberfest
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
i
cant
wait
to
drink
this
during
foot
games
back
to
beer
it
has
sight
after
taste
to
me
is
perfect
for
fest
beers
check
this
beer
out
i
get
it
there
are
many
different
fest
beers
out
there
there
are
some
fakes
but
some
really
good
ones
that
is
true
to
its
form
i
believe
this
is
one
of
them
cheers
an
oversized
can
more
than
a
quart
which
comes
in
a
massive
dimpled
glass
beer
mug
for
oktoberest
yeah
its
a
gimmick
but
the
salesman
somehow
talked
me
into
it
yet
the
beer
is
actually
not
a
disappointment
poured
a
3
white
head
and
in
fact
every
subsequent
refill
produced
more
than
an
2
each
time
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
malt
and
classic
hops
taste
although
a
little
bmc
has
more
malt
and
hops
than
typical
plus
is
nice
and
fresh
and
refreshing
its
a
fine
beer
for
a
fall
party
paulaner
o
some
beers
are
just
made
to
be
quaffed
without
any
thrills
this
is
one
of
them
what
a
session
brew
prost
pours
a
clear
straw
bone
white
head
frothy
smells
of
wheat
bready
malt
and
herbal
hops
clean
maltyness
wheaty
with
some
faint
bubblegum
mildly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
overall
a
nice
marzen
beer
on
the
light
side
and
easy
to
drink
in
mass
quantities
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
im
happy
its
on
my
anniversary
kudos
on
the
commemorative
octoberfest
glass
sure
to
pour
beers
in
the
future
food
match
oktoberfest
food
fried
pork
fried
onions
fried
potato
fried
bread
fried
sausage
fried
etc
you
get
the
picture
o
this
was
one
of
my
first
oktoberfest
beers
and
it
definitely
opened
the
door
for
me
for
enjoying
this
style
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
great
session
beer
d
very
i
had
a
whole
liter
of
it
d
good
thing
it
is
a
full
liter
anything
smaller
would
not
last
long
enough
yes
this
beer
is
drinkable
a
little
more
flavor
than
a
euro
lager
and
comparable
to
a
good
helles
lager
easy
to
drink
a
liter
for
a
golden
beer
this
one
is
very
nice
i
enjoy
a
darker
beer
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
to
bad
its
limited
edition
if
you
you
see
this
in
your
local
beer
store
snatch
one
up
taste
is
interesting
full
stonger
hellesmarzen
character
with
hint
of
hefeweizen
yeastiness
again
banana
and
bubblegum
it
has
lots
of
dough
with
herbs
up
front
then
the
bananabubblegum
yeastiness
hint
appears
and
lasts
nice
crisp
apple
element
an
herbalzesty
finish
is
followed
by
creamy
doughappleherblemon
aftertaste
highly
consistent
it
is
smooth
faintly
oily
with
a
light
creaminess
yet
also
a
little
liveliness
d
over
all
this
is
a
wonderful
exhibition
by
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
highly
flavorful
and
highly
sessionable
if
only
this
brew
were
available
year
round
d
what
can
you
say
about
a
beer
thats
been
created
just
for
drinking
in
large
quantities
in
great
revelry
this
is
definitely
the
wiesn
style
of
märzen
that
has
become
the
brewers
choice
at
the
munich
okto
but
dont
mistaken
it
with
helles
its
the
helles
big
brother
and
it
wants
you
to
enjoy
prosit
notes
well
this
is
what
marzen
is
like
straight
from
germany
the
verdict
is
quite
tasty
prost
wish
this
were
served
year
round
and
easily
available
would
be
a
top
5
session
beer
for
me
d
such
a
nice
fresh
crisp
mouthfeel
along
with
a
nice
aroma
and
flavour
makes
this
an
incredibly
sessionable
beer
even
with
its
amount
drinkability
while
this
beer
only
scores
decent
marks
for
flavor
aroma
and
feel
it
is
designed
for
drinkability
and
i
find
that
it
does
quite
well
at
that
this
beer
sets
a
goal
drink
1
liter
in
a
short
sitting
and
it
makes
it
easy
to
achieve
great
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
it
went
a
treat
with
my
home
made
sausages
overall
this
beer
was
interesting
but
not
great
a
bit
over
priced
if
it
werent
for
the
free
glass
i
think
i
like
paulaners
dark
beers
such
as
their
oktoberfest
and
salvator
more
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
since
this
is
a
great
big
can
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
actually
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
doesnt
do
the
ofest
style
much
good
a
typical
euro
lager
but
not
an
ofest
really
happy
this
came
in
a
can
however
because
most
beers
i
find
from
europe
are
skunked
pretty
bad
a
solid
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
golden
color
with
white
head
and
not
what
i
expected
for
a
marzen
breadygrainy
aromas
abound
on
the
palate
is
a
dry
quality
but
malt
presence
is
still
noted
almost
wheaty
with
some
herbal
hops
kicking
in
to
dry
things
out
more
complex
than
most
marzens
that
tend
to
be
more
malty
and
more
hop
presence
as
well
plus
the
pale
color
is
nice
and
this
is
very
drinkable
nice
1l
krug
in
the
gift
pack
as
well
d
it
is
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
for
long
hard
days
out
in
the
field
or
warm
days
in
general
its
not
typical
for
the
marzens
ive
tried
before
but
its
still
very
drinkable
this
is
pretty
much
teetering
on
the
barest
edge
of
an
enjoyable
ofest
bier
for
me
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
if
you
like
this
style
on
the
lighter
end
and
i
can
absolutely
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
beer
other
than
that
well
enjoy
your
krug
i
know
i
will
only
problem
i
see
from
this
beer
is
they
only
give
you
1
liter
of
it
paulaner
should
sell
this
in
1
liter
cans
year
round
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
gift
set
for
sure
serving
type
can
im
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
off
the
shelf
and
im
sure
you
will
be
too
drinkability
perfect
im
sure
you
could
sit
there
with
mug
after
mug
after
mug
on
a
nice
fall
day
in
munich
and
have
a
day
to
cherish
if
you
could
remember
it
a
1
liter
can
with
a
matching
mug
in
a
commemorative
packaging
a
vigorous
pour
yields
a
huge
head
that
rises
like
shaving
cream
and
stays
quite
a
while
a
bit
of
lace
hear
and
there
classic
marzen
golden
hue
is
brilliantly
clear
smell
is
malt
with
a
light
hop
floral
and
a
touch
of
pepper
taste
is
light
bready
malt
palate
with
good
dose
of
clean
saaz
like
hops
in
the
finish
feel
is
finely
carbonated
and
medium
weight
with
a
refreshing
tingley
sensation
super
easy
to
drink
when
you
pour
the
big
can
in
the
big
glass
you
dont
expect
it
to
be
gone
that
quickly
it
goes
fast
paulaner
wiezn
bier
was
crystal
clear
and
golden
in
color
it
had
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
with
a
little
lace
left
behind
the
smell
was
light
malt
with
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
the
taste
was
light
malt
upfront
with
some
peppery
and
spicy
hops
coming
through
the
finish
was
dry
and
makes
you
want
more
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
outstanding
this
is
one
the
most
drinkable
beers
that
i
have
tried
and
is
worth
a
try
now
i
just
just
need
to
find
more
without
having
to
buy
another
mug
very
drinkable
as
drinkable
a
liter
as
any
octoberfest
ive
had
great
combo
of
beer
can
and
glassware
overall
an
excellent
oktoberfestbier
and
i
believe
that
the
germans
still
do
it
better
than
the
americans

with
a
medium
sized
head
copious
lacing
aromas
of
malts
cut

and
some

nice
taste
to
this
beer
it
has
that
typical
oktoberfest
spice
flavor
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
taste
to
it
malts
as
well
this
was
definitely
worth
the
purchase
the
well
made
glass
stein
the
beer
is
a
one
time
brew
i
believe
and
its
certainly
a
flavorful
oktoberfest
the
only
thing
that
would
make
this
not
too
drinkable
is
that
you
have
to
drink
the
liter
at
one
time
but
thats
something
you
want
to
do
once
you
grip
the
mug
this
beer
is
an
experience
to
be
had
poured
into
my
commorative

liter
stein
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
head
nose
of
toasted
bread
and
fresh
mild

taste
is
excellent
roasted
malt
and
pretzel
are
there
mild
hops
round
out
the
deep
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
slightly
lower
carbonation
for
the
style
makes
this
possible
this
is
a
grade
a
session
beer
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
drinkanle
enough
to
take
down
a
liter
or
two
at
a
sitting
cheers
a
great
oktoberfest
quaffer
nothing
overly
exciting
but
damned
exciting
to
drink
in
such
a
cool
mug
in
a
festive
setting
prosit
to
another
oktobefest
and
looking
forward
to
next
year
gemuetlichkeit
oktoberfest
isnt
about
beer
per
se
its
about
drinking
beer
and
a
lot
of
it
for
that
matter
therefore
the
oktoberfest
style
doesnt
concern
itself
with
connoisseurship
or
contemplative
quaffing
subtle
detail
or
creative
innovation
it
need
just
be
well
suited
to
festivities
food
and
merriment
and
while
it
goes
without
saying
id
be
enjoying
this
more
in
germany
i
think
the
rest
of
this
maß
will
be
put
to
good
use
this
is
a
pretty
clean
lager
that
drinks
like
a
slightly
amped
up
helles
this
is
definitely
a
good
thing
and
i
am
definitely
enjoying
the
interesting
pale
malt
character
and
the
herbal
lemon
honey
character
that
comes
from
the
mix
of
malt
and
hops
this
is
definitely
an
appropriate
beer
to
drink
by
the
liter
it
goes
down
quite
well
nothing
earthshattering
here
but
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
brew
this
is
an
ideal
oktoberfest
to
quaff
while
celebrating
while
it
retains
good
flavor
the
brewery
had
mass
consumption
in
mind
pale
amber
color
big
cottony
head
from
the
pour
which
deflated
in
short
time
looked
awesome
in
the
tall
1l
mug
and
it
was
fun
to
drink
in
a
way
whatever
poured
into

1

smells
great
nice
malty
aroma
taste
to
me
it
tastes
just
like
a
munchener
helles
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
wanted
more
good
beerbut
not
worth
the
premium
price
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
paulaners
regular
oktoberfest
on
a
side
note
paulaner
threw
a
200th
oktoberfest
celebration
at
their
corporate
hq
in
littleton
co
a
few
weeks
ago
this
was
on
tap
and
i
think
it
was
more
flavorful
in
draft
form
but
i
was
at
an
oktoberfest
so
who
knows
i
bought
this
with
a
glass
mass
krug
for
13
bucks
it
came
in
a
liter
can
with
a
drink
before
11
mar
11
on
it
i
have
big
expectations
out
of
this
this
is
by
far
the
palest
oktoberfest
i
have
seen
it
is
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
thick
puffy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
in
patches
it
smells
of
clean
pilsner
malts
much
like
a
helles
it
is
more
sweet
than
bitter
there
is
imbalance
in
the
force
very
grainy
and
grassy
i
could
swear
this
is
paulaner
helles
lager
packed
as
oktoberfest
hop
notes
are
astringent
but
minimal
it
is
thin
and
and
sweet
on
the
tongue
this
is
not
good
oktoberfest
it
is
another
beer
and
another
style
not
bad
for
everyday
swill
and
at
least
i
got
a
cool
mass
krug
out

all

is
some

some
lederhosen

with

i
picked
up
pours
into
my
gigantic
mug
a
nice
shiny
light
orange
with
a
big
white
billowy
head
easily
a
true
octoberfest
here
aroma
is
honey
and
nice
sweet
malts
with
a
hopoil
like
hint
lots
of
honey
in
the
taste
a
bready
malt
characteristic
right
along
side
not
as
sweet
as
other
ofests
could
use
a
bit
more
dryness
as
this
tends
a
slight
bit
sweeter
though
its
not
really
sweet
by
any
stretch
still
i
love
the
beer
an
easy
finishing
easydrinking
brew
worth
a
try
for
the
season
or
any
season
d
i
drank
the
whole
thing
in
about
20
min
so
ya
its
super
drinkable
i
was
not
trying
to
chug
just
goes
down
easy
d
i
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
me
to
drink
this
whole
beer
it
went
surprisingly
quickly
therefore
it
must
have
a
good
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
but
the
only
way
to
get
it
in
ontario
is
in
a
1l
can
with
a
giant
glass
in
a
gift
set
for
13
40
so
this
will
be
the
only
one
i
have
in
the
format
alas
still
ill
bet
it
would
be
fantastic
served
fresh
picked
this
up
to
compare
it
to
the
marzen
style
that
ive
been
enjoying
since
mid
august
novelty
packaging
but
kind
of
cool
a
liter
can
of
paulaner
wiesn
bier
packed
inside
of
a
one
liter
paulaner
krug
pours
a
bright
straw
deep
golden
hue
crystal
clear
egg
shell
white
head
forms
thick
and
leaves
beautiful
scattered
lacing
it
was
worth
the
12
bucks
i
used
to
have
the
same
krug
in
college
and
back
then
i
paid
9
bucks
for
it
so
for
3
dollars
extra
the
beer
and
glass
didnt
seem
like
a
bad
deal
aroma
has
a
beautiful
honey
drizzled
malt
layer
with
herbalspicy
noble
hops
flavor
is
great
clean
sweet
all
malt
presence
huge
biscuitcracker
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
herbalspicy
german
noble
hop
character
balances
it
out
perfectly
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
i
would
like
to
festively
drink
by
the
liter
this
is
a
nice
version
of
it
with
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
back
end
a
touch
of
tart
green
apple
actually
fits
the
season
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
healthy
but
smooth
carbonation
flowing
it
really
goes
down
easy
the
most
drinkable
form
of
a
lager
built
for
fest
tents
in
munich
i
could
definitely
picture
putting
a
few
of
these
liters
down
at
the
big
dance
someday
d
fantastic
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
the
most
drinkable
of
the
810
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
year
purchased
a
1l
can
with
a
1l
mug
pours
a
golden
colour
with
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
eventually
dissipates
but
that
is
partially
because
it
takes
a
while
to
drink
1l
of
beer
small
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
nutty
with
some
mild
hop
aroma
flavour
has
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
with
balanced
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
id
buy
more
of
it
if
i
could
get
it
smaller
than
the
1l
with
the
glass
an
awesome
beer
d
until
you
drop
taste
caramel
malt
and
breadiness
with
some
nice
herbal
hops
that
show
up
after
the
malt
and
linger
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
good
balance
between
malt
and
hop
probably
the
best
12
ive
ever
spent
beerwise
the
brew
was
awesome
ive
got
a
kickass
stein
to
both
use
and
display
and
i
got
to
drink
the
real
deal
even
if
i
was
in
tn
d
it
better
be
drinkable
for
the
size
of
the
can
for
12
its
an
absolute
steal
when
you
get
the
maas
krug
with
it
a
good
oktoberfest
that
would
be
a
pleasure
to
consume
by
the
liter
in
munich
i
got
a
1000ml
can
of
this
inside
an
oktoberfest
glass
and
at
first
i
was
worried
that
it
would
be
hard
to
down
it
all
but
as
i
get
further
into
it
it
becomes
more
and
more
of
a
pleasure
to
drinkability
ranks
high
this
sits
light
and
tastes
good
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
hesitate
from
grabbing
another
except
that
it
is
almost
34
ounces
d
this
is
perhaps
the
beers
highest
point
you
will
have
no
problem
downing
this
on
the
final
hot
summer
days
with
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
and
the
perfect
carbonation
this
beers
drinkability
is
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
all
day
for
a
few
days
in
munich
since
im
not
there
this
one
can
will
have
to
do
for
now
nothing
too
special
and
the
oktoberfest
from
paulaner
is
better
im
happy
with
the
glass
though
drinkability
is
spectacular
beautifully
flavorful
great
balance
excellent
mouthfeel
nice
to
get
a
german
beer
like
this
where
you
actually
know
how
long
its
been
on
the
shelf
beautifully
fresh
love
it
beautiful
beer
pours
from
a
massive
can
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
big
frumpy
white
head
aromas
are
predominantly
grainy
and
honeyish
disappointingly
simple
luckily
the
flavors
are
more
interesting
with
lightly
toasty
and
woody
notes
adding
to
the
mix
finishes
toasty
all
around
its
just
okay
i
expected
more
from
paulaner
poured
with
a
nice
big
head
that
took
a
few
minutes
to
dissipate
after
that
now
head
or
lacing
goes
down
real
smooth
very
drinkable
wish
i
was
in
germany
but
this
is
a
nice
reminder
of
what
i
had
when
i
was
there
drinkability
really
goes
down
well
although
im
not
too
sure
about
a
second
1l
can
i
havent
found
this
anywhere
other
than
in
these
limited
edition
cans
kind
of
limits
the
drinking
a
lot
idea
i
guess
i
need
to
go
to
germany
id
definitely
revisit
this
one
its
good
stuff
by
any
standards
high
carbonation
leads
to
an
effervesent
and
bubbly
feel
early
and
leans
away
from
creaminess
the
carbonation
ushers
in
the
minerally
crispclean
feel
late
for
a
6er
this
one
scrubs
the
palate
a
bit
too
much
the
mouthfeel
has
a
light
touch
of
carbonation
it
verges
on
creamy
without
that
filling
feeling
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
use
to
wash
down
a
big
meal
or
drink
in
mass
quantities
perfect
for
festing
pours
a
rich
golden
honey
color
with
a
soapy
pure
white
head
that
settles
into
a
sparce
cap
some
chunky
lacing
on
the
dipple
mug
the
aroma
is
of
a
doughy
munich
malt
some
honey
grassy
and
peppery
hops
the
taste
is
of
the
sweet
doughy
munich
malt
light
grains
honey
touch
of
tin
and
some
grassy
and
peppery
hop
pretty
much
a
stronger
munich
helles
and
typical
festbier
the
body
is
moderate
with
semisoft
carbonation
sweet
overall
finishes
with
a
slight
peppery
hop
balance
a
good
tent
or
fest
style
oktoberfest
i
prefer
their
marzen
oktoberfest
but
this
does
remind
me
of
your
typical
1
liter
tent
brau
definite
try
as
it
seems
to
be
limited
to
this
year
only
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
barley
any
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
mug
as
it
recedes
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
up
front
with
a
slight
toast
and
just
a
bit
of
fresh
bread
very
simple
and
straight
forward
nothing
but
simple
clean
aromas
thats
my
favorite
thing
about
good
lagers
there
is
no
way
to
hide
things
its
either
there
or
its
not
the
flavor
is
exactly
the
same
with
slightly
grassy
hops
and
some
yeasty
biscuits
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
mixed
with
toasty
bread
really
simple
really
straight
forward
great
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
creamy
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
that
makes
your
mouth
linger
for
another
sip
man
this
brings
me
back
to
munich
i
would
rather
be
sipping
on
a
liter
of
this
in
a
biergarten
then
in
my
living
room
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
giving
away
a
lot
of
paulaner
1
liter
krugs
d
as
with
all
marzen
its
ment
to
be
consumned
in
large
quantities
and
this
is
one
to
fit
in
with
the
others
d
considering
i
had
a
1
quart
size
serving
of
this
i
would
say
1
per
sitting
if
you
find
these
in
12oz
bottle
form
its
easy
to
drink
several
poured
from
the
big
ass
can
into
the
paulaner
mug
beer
produced
on
061610
with
a
best
by
date
of
031611
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
this
1l
mug
after
this
beer
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
did
not
last
very
long
not
much
for
lacing
either
i
blame
the
mug
more
than
anything
for
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
but
the
pale
color
is
not
what
i
would
describe
a
good
oktoberfest
as
having
has
a
hoppy
and
sweet
aroma
smells
floral
with
notes
of
honey
and
grain
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
otherwise
a
solid
lager
very
floral
and
grassy
in
nature
the
malt
tastes
very
sweet
i
would
of
preferred
a
more
toasted
nature
feels
a
little
heavier
than
it
probably
is
because
of
the
lingering
sweetness
weighs
on
the
palate
perfectly
carbonated
as
to
be
expected
an
arm
workout
hoisting
the
heavly
mug
and
1l
of
beer
no
problem
downing
the
entire
contents
of
the
can
probably
will
be
a
little
drunky
after
finishing
this
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
the
abv
is
easily
managed
and
the
flavor
profile
is
ok
its
a
bit
boring
and
will
certainly
be
a
chore
to
finish
the
whole
liter
drinkability
an
easydrinking
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beer
this
beer
looks
absolutely
stately
in
its
intended
mug
and
i
can
only
imagine
the
pleasure
that
would
come
from
quaffing
down
a
few
of
these
on
the
wiesn
d
great
balance
and
very
easy
to
take
down
i
guess
thats
why
the
mug
is
so
big
now
i
just
have
to
travel
to
germany
to
compare
to
what
they
serve
in
the
tent
on
the
can
it
says
oktoberfest
bier
abv
6
0
so
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
brew
i
was
tasting
is
actually
the
same
as
this
one
this
does
not
really
taste
like
a
märzen
rather
like
a
pint
starkbier
reduced
with
say
half
a
pint
ordinary
lager
lacks
smoothness
and
pleasing
flavors
what
i
taste
is
mostly
bittersweet
and
sticky
not
a
brew
to
remember
overall
a
very
nice
american
take
on
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there

around
great

and
very

a
very
enjoyable
offering
thirsty
dog
barktoberfest
is
a
howlin
good
ale
its
as
good
as
that
pun
is
bad
its
ultrarich
maltiness
and
all
its
notions
of
walnut
cake
and
nutty
pastry
that
accompany
it
are
irresistible
especially
when
placed
inside
such
a
quaffable
easytochugback
lager
frame
after
the
iconic
german
brands
this
is
an
obvious
one
to
recommend
in
fact
its
a
new
personal
favourite
t
has
a
sharp
acidity
poignant
slightly
citric
and
woodsy
grassy
wheat
elements
and
darker
malts
deep
sweetness
bready
very
toasty
and
rich
i
think
its
a
wellattenuated
showcase
of
vienna
malts
sweetness
is
decidedly
like
maltcandy
a
decent
oktoberfest
that
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
among
the
crowd
pours
a
deep
copper
colored
body
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
light
scents
of
whiskey
and
a
caramel
biscuit
solid
malty
goodness
hits
the
palate
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
bursts
of
top
notch
crispy
caramel
goodness
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
but
a
heavy
oktoberfest
than
most
versions
today
true
to
the
style
deep
and
pretty
rich
great
with
spare
ribs
or
barbequed
anything
nice
and
creamy
and
very
smooth
its
a
good
one
clear
medium
amber
pour
with
a
red
hue
very
nice
head
and
lacing
that
lingers
very
slight
nose
of
sweet
caramel
malt
light
medium
body
and
well
carbonated
the
flavor
profile
is
laid
back
as
a
marzen
should
be
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
the
carbonation
yields
a
crisp
finish
identical
to
the
flavor
profile
thirsty
dog
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
another
outstanding
offering
that
is
true
to
style
o
overall
the
body
is
a
bit
more
robust
then
you
may
want
in
a
typical
octoberfest
style
this
is
more
of
a
heavier
robust
slower
drinking
less
volume
version
not
the
traditional
german
old
world
style
as
its
labels
claim
big
sweetness
and
big
syrupy
body
some
nobel
hops
but
not
as
pronouced
fairly
reserved
and
could
of
been
fresher
the
abv
of
6
0
seems
a
bit
higher
then
the
norm
not
unexpected
from
the
heavy
handed
malt
body
still
some
toastiness
just
a
bigger
fuller
american
version
somewhat
tasty
by
itself
i
rated
this
per
my
expectations
vs
an
true
german
style
counterpart
some
may
like
a
fuller
version
in
much
less
quantity
to
which
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
an
offshoot
american
bastardization
really
yummy
immediately
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
great
lakes
brewery
has
been
regarded
as
the
gold
standard
in
local
craft
brews
but
thirsty
dog
has
come
a
long
way
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
sheet
of
lacework
aroma
of
caramelized
malt
and
buttery
toffee
in
the
flavor
toffee
caramel
and
a
faint
hint
of
butterscotch
fairly
bitter
earthy
hops
do
a
fine
job
of
balancing
this
seasonal
lager
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
oktoberfest
thirsty
dog
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
a
hit
for
sure
some
will
be
opposed
to
the
sweet
flavors
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
marzen
and
the
malt
needs
to
shine
over
the
hops
and
it
does
what
we
got
is
really
nice
complexity
with
bread
fruit
and
raisin
flavors
the
alcohol
is
expertly
and
dangerously
concealed
and
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
medium
carbonation
and
thickness
and
an
impressively
clean
finish
given
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
there
are
a
lot
of
oktoberfestmarzen
beers
out
this
time
of
year
that
dont
impress
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
manages
to
be
both
well
thought
out
and
nicely
executed
overall
i
can
honestly
say
this
oktoberfest
is
unique
compared
to
all
the
others
ive
tried
its
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
its
still
delicious
overall
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
im
preferential
to
sweet
and
malty
beers
and
this
one
definitely
hits
the
mark
great
for
sitting
around
a
campfire
on
a
cool
fall
evening
overall
delicious
and
will
definitely
buy
again
wished
i
had
bought
more
than
a
single
bottle
overall
great
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
will
remind
you
of
oktoberfest
and
the
fall
to
come
i
am
a
big
fan
of
marzens
and
this
is
up
there
toward
the
top
overall
one
of
the
sweetest
octoberfests
ive
ever
had
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
many
of
these
its
a
little
out
of
balance
with
the
high
sweet
flavors
the
fruits
and
spices
get
buried
rather
easy
its
worth
a
try
but
not
a
great
example
for
what
a
marzen
can
be
overall
nearly
an
interesting
spin
on
the
marzen
the
sweetness
is
almost
a
little
overwhelming
but
seems
to
be
okay
wow
great
lakes
lost
a
head
to
head
lager
battle
this
is
a
first
for
me
this
is
an
oktoberfest
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
each
fall
nice
example
of
the
style
its
similar
to
great
lakes
oktoberfest
but
somewhat
lacks
the
complexity
this
is
worth
checking
out
if
you
come
across
it
an
everyday
autumn
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
friends
and
bratwurst
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
lace
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
bread
crust
the
flavor
is
complex
with
nuts
roasted
malt
and
toffee
notes
with
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
thirsty
dog
barktoberfest
is
a
very
good
brew
very
drinkable
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
drinkability
on
point
with
glbc
as
one
of
my
favorite
micro
domestics
tons
of
flavor
for
a
deceptively
lightercolored
brew
and
a
lot
going
on
only
picked
up
one
bottle
to
sample
but
ill
definitely
be
getting
more
if
i
can
find
it
a
nice
surprise
here
overall
and
one
i
enjoyed
every
second
of
drinkability
i
love
malt
bombs
and
am
a
sucker
for
bocks
porters
stouts
and
usually
oktoberfests
but
this
one
is
just
a
sweet
mess
pass
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
damn
good
american
version
of
a
marzen
this
beer
was
all
about
the
malts
and
had
just
the
right
amount
of
toast
to
it
along
with
a
nice
nutty
flavor
this
beer
was
really
drinkable
just
how
it
should
be
i
would
have
no
problem
polishing
off
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
nice
fall
night
one
of
the
most
drinkable
marzens
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
doesnt
last
long
in
my
glass
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
it
was
all
about
the
malts
and
they
imparted
a
really
good
flavor
that
made
me
keep
wanting
to
take
another
drink
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
carbonation
the
aroma
was
a
little
weak
and
wasnt
too
interesting
and
the
carbonation
would
have
better
suited
this
beer
if
it
was
bumped
up
to
medium
i
am
kinda
bummed
that
i
found
out
about
this
beer
at
the
end
of
the
oktoberfest
season
had
i
known
about
this
beer
earlier
it
would
have
been
in
my
fridge
for
all
of
september
and
october
i
will
make
sure
not
to
forget
about
this
beer
next
year
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
when
looking
for
a
good
marzen
its
a
great
american
version
of
what
a
marzen
is
all
about
this
beer
is
up
there
with
their
tripel
as
one
of
my
favorite
beer
from
thirsty
dog
i
have
only
tried
three
of
their
beers
but
so
far
i
have
been
happy
with
every
single
one
of
them
so
theres
no
doubt
that
i
will
be
trying
more
of
their
beers
thirsty
dog
did
a
great
job
at
making
a
sessionable
and
tasty
marzen
that
i
find
to
be
better
then
samuel
adams
oktoberfest
it
takes
a
lot
to
knock
that
beer
out
of
the
top
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
but
this
beer
brought
the
heat
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
every
drop
of
it
this
is
my
new
favorite
marzen
pours
brownish
orange
with
a
halffinger
of
fizzy
head
smells
malty
with
some
subtle
caramel
the
initial
taste
is
malty
sweetness
but
that
is
backed
by
a
bitter
hop
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
hearty
flavor
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
a
fire
on
crisp
fall
days
overall
not
bad
typical
american
oktoberfest
with
reddish
caramel
malts
and
syrupy
flavors
a
bit
of
a
decent
lager
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
that
could
use
more
of
moreys
bottom
line
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
to
me
ive
had
a
good
amount
of
oktoberfest
this
fall
and
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
the
best
recommend
pretty
good
solid
oktoberfest
here
easy
to
drink
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
a
novel
take
on
oktoberfest
that
is
still
true
to
style
o
not
very
complex
but
its
so
tasty
im
not
complaining
at
all
great
fall
beer
to
drink
watching
a
football
game
o
pretty
enjoyable
but
kinda
lacking
for
the
style
if
it
werent
for
the
lager
yeast
id
say
this
is
like
drinking
a
carmel
apple
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
malt
bomb
dont
pass
this
up
o
i
love
this
stuff
thirsty
dog
is
really
under
the
radar
and
its
a
shame
this
is
my
first
lager
from
them
if
the
others
are
this
good
ill
be
all
over
them
i
think
this
is
right
behind
berkshire
for
my
favorite
marzen
really
great
example
of
the
style
i
wish
great
craft
lagers
like
this
were
a
more
common
sight
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
early
on
in
the
season
i
am
a
big
fan
of
thirsty
dog
but
they
were
always
over
shadowed
by
great
lakes
this
beer
however
has
exceptional
taste
and
is
smooth
its
definately
an
ace
in
the
akron
brewerys
deck
worth
having
and
going
back
for
seconds
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
neither
great
nor
offensively
bad
its
solid
but
not
memorable
hmmm
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
thought
it
better
than
this
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
id
prefer
the
more
triedandtrue
brooklyn
i
just
finished
reviewing
and
dissing
for
its
ordinariness
as
a
more
classic
example
of
the
style
o
as
far
as
oktoberfest
beers
there
are
much
better
options
a
little
boozy
for
the
style
and
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
earthy
and
medicinal
i
wish
more
biscuit
or
nutty
qualities
were
present
in
this
beer
o
good
beer
for
this
time
of
year
stylewise
i
was
hoping
more
malts
would
shine
through
it
seems
a
little
meek
i
was
looking
forward
to
more
carameltoffeetoasted
nuts
flavor
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
though
just
a
fantastic
octoberfest
in
the
flavor
department
bursnting
with
juicy
melted
caramel
and
toffee
butterscotch
flavors
very
malty
and
cereal
ridden
full
of
fresh
baked
sweet
breads
with
just
enough
hop
to
balance
and
keep
things
from
being
cloying
thick
creamy
with
good
carbonation
just
delicious
overall
i
welcome
the
style
and
they
did
a
very
good
job
representing
it
if
i
could
get
it
cheaper
than
3
dollars
a
bottle
18
dollar
sixer
i
could
enjoy
it
more
damn
thirsty
dog
is
pricey
here
on
a
separate
note
the
thirsty
dog
brewing
co
has
a
very
similar
label
to
the
great
lakes
brewing
co
not
sure
if

another
impressive
offering
from
an
ohio
brewery
that
tends
to
get

mix
great

in

the
class
of

but
these
guys
deliver
the
goods
as
well
d
drier
than
expected
for
a
marzen
style
and
a
bit
hoppier
on
the
finish
too
wish
it
had
more
body
while
there
are
better
examples
of

to
me
was
a
good
aspect
of
this
beer
d
very

probably
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
oktoberfests
out
there
if

taste
was

started
off

just
like
it
smelled
but
not
in
a
bad
way
a
bit
of
bitterness
formed
after
lingering
in
the
mouth
it
felt
good
in
the
mouth
there
was
carbonation
on
the
toungue
despite
none
being
evident
in
the
beer
and
it
coated
well
good
to

it
was
well
balanced

fairly
solid
oktoberfest
overall
decent
beer
bitterness
is
a
little
too
high
for
this
style
with
all
of
the
other
good
oktoberfests
on
the
market
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
choose
this
one

this
is
solid
maybe
a
touch
of
diacetyl
butter
have
no
fear
it
doesnt
hurt
the
flavor
profile
its
not
offensive
for
me
but
im
not
sensitive
to
that
flavor
only
offense
for
me
is
overall
sweetness
it
hits
the
super
malty
profile
without
hitting
me
with
enough
herbal
spicy
qualities
to
balance
things
out
mouthfeel
is
creamy
assertively
carbonated
not
thin
not
heavy
or
cloying
drinkability
overall
is
alright
a
bottle
wasnt
bad
but
this
style
is
meant
to
be
drank
by
the
liter
and
this
version
doesnt
justify
that
portion
size
a
straightforward
interpretation
of
the
style
caramel
maltforward
some
moderate
grain
notes
finish
was
a
rather
pungent
quinine
bitterness
that
was
out
of
place
in
the
style
ive
noted
others
complaining
of
butterscotch
notes
but
my
bottles
have
none
so
perhaps
a
bit
of
quality
control
at
the
brewery
the
label
art
with
the
dogs
howling
at
the
moon
was
an
amusing
touch
picked
up
a
single
at
abes
cold
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
very
tasty
lager
it
was
a
little
too
toasty
for
the
style
though
i
wont
short
it
for
that
with
smooth
mellow
bread
and
hint
of
caramel
the
only
knock
is
a
mild
touch
of
diacetyl
in
the
aroma
still
id
be
happy
to
have
a
stein
full
of
this
oktoberfest
any
time
there
was
almost
certainly
some
sort
of
diacetyl
problem
going
on
here
but
it
was
so
far
gone
that
the
brewery
should
have
caught
this
i
will
rereview
if
i
get
the
chance
to
try
this
again
definitely
not
the
intent
i
hope
of
the
brewery
for
it
to
taste
like
this
dcant
get
over
the
off
sour
green
apple
not
a
fan
of
that
flavor
and
i
dont
think
it
should
be
there
the
heavy
sweetness
is
never
balanced
with
malt
complexity
or
hop
bitterness
thus
the
sweetness
causes
early
fatigue
of
the
palate
drinkability
im
torn
on
this
beer
it
smells
really
good
but
falls
short
on
the
taste
i
have
another
bottle
to
try
but
im
not
sure
if
id
get
again
or
not
solid
drinkable
festbier
ive
kept
the
mouthfeel
score
low
because
i
reckon
its
a
touch
on
the
supple
side
but
actually
think
this
works
out
quite
nicely
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
pleasant
and
drinkable
on
to
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
light
amber
with
carboplenty
a
thick
head
soon
turns
into
a
lacy
ring
typical
of
this
style
smells
phenomenal
yeasty
and
sweet
and
toasty
taste
starts
with
more
of
a
bitter
tip
than
other
marzens
which
i
like
all
the
while
balanced
very
well
with
toasted
malt
finishes
bitter
and
sorta
sticky
but
not
too
bad
feel
is
nicely
carbed
and
dense
just
a
finedrinking
marzen
and
a
great
representative
of
the
style
excellent
its
really
pretty
in
the
glass
and
it
has
another
cool
dog
oriented
label
a
bunch
of
doggie
ghosts
in
a
pumpkin
patch
i
am
just
glad
i
dont
have
more
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
not
the
best
ever
but
very
very
serviceable
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
simply
very
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
if
you
havent
had
it
go
for
it
ill
stick
with
great
lakes
or
sam
adams
im
not
sure
what
i
think
of
this
one
ive
had
better
fests
no
doubt
but
this
was
a
decent
beer
for
sure
some
characteristics
i
didnt
like
but
others
i
did
try
it
for
yourself
pours
a
nice
copper
orange
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
but
no
lacing
nice
malty
sweet
scent
with
hints
of
jerky
enlgish
hops
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
as
well
with
a
hint
of
caramel
but
with
an
odd
hop
aftertaste
more
english
than
german
goes
down
well
the
odd
hop
aftertaste
does
not
linger
but
rather
a
nice
sweetness
does
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
drinkable
marzen
nothing
earth
shattering
but
i
could
put
away
quite
a
few
on
a
fall
evening
overall
this
is
actually
a
pretty
decent
effort
from
thirsty
dog
definetly
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
i
have
had
this
year
but
as
a
whole
these
beers
remain
rather
unremarkable
overall
as
there
are
much
more
festive
and
flavorful
options
out
there
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
while
the
marzen
lager
isnt
my
favorite
stylethis
is
a
very
good
beer
worth
seeking
outimo
notes
the
first
thirsty
dog
beer
that
did
not
really
impress
me
i
should
note
that
i
had
great
lakes
brewing
company
oktoberfest
earlier
today
and
having
the
two
of
them
so
close
together
really
shows
what
this
beer
lacks
d
a
pleasant
suprise
and
not
very
americanized
if
hearty
fresh
grain
could
be
considered
so
the
mf
wins
me
over
as
its
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
not
quite
the
best
oktoberfest
that
ive
had
but
its
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
an
easy
pint
to
throw
back
here
flavorful
but
a
bit
light
around
the
edges
a
novice
marzen
poured
an
ambercopper
clear
liquid
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
leaving
some
lace
on
the
glass
immediately
i
noticed
a
fruity
smell
should
this
be
possible
in
an
oktoberfest
lager
taste
is
rather
carmely
followed
by
a
fruitiness
very
little
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
i
am
not
sure
about
the
fruitiness
in
this
beer
it
is
not
bad
but
does
not
seem
to
fit
the
style
it
also
seems
to
cut
back
on
the
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
does
not
seem
to
fit
there
are
several
others
rthat
are
better
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
finger
or
so
of
bubbly
white
head
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
of
biscuits
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
nice
piney
aftertaste
medium
mouth
with
decent
carbonation
as
surly
admits
on
the
label
this
isnt
your
traditional
oktoberfest
but
its
freakin
great
overall
i
like
it
as
it
says
on
the
can
it
isnt
intended
to
be
a
classic
ofest
beer
nonetheless
it
is
close
in
some
intriguing
ways
and
it
delivers
on
the
rye
which
is
always
appreciated
in
the
right
mood
and
on
the
right
day
i
find
this
beer
to
be
awesome
other
days
its
an
oddball
but
one
i
appreciate
this
year
like
every
year
its
gone
too
soon
poured
into
a
becker
a
clear
rich
copperbronze
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
atop
grain
and
light
toast
in
the
nose
along
with
mild
spicy
rye
dry
on
the
palate
wich
i
liked
alot
with
german
malts
toasted
bread
notesa
good
shot
of
spicy
hops
and
light
lactic
rye
in
the
finish
i
could
drink
this
from
a
stein
all
daya
great
ofest
beer
pours
a
brilliant
clear
orange
with
dense
white
head
terrific
retention
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
nose
features
biscuity
malt
up
front
with
that
trademark
marzen
character
that
i
can
only
describe
as
the
smell
of
fall
or
freshly
raked
wet
leaves
the
nose
also
has
a
noteable
hop
presence
which
im
not
used
to
for
the
style
but
i
must
say
that
it
is
welcome
the
taste
is
malt
forward
with
notes
of
biscuit
honey
and
bread
this
is
followed
up
by
slight
herbal
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
appropriate
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
if
by
oktoberfest
surly
actually
means
pale
ale
i
love
both
surly
furious
and
cynicale
so
ill
stick
with
those
surlys
o
not
a
typical
oktoberfest
but
these
guys
love
pushing
the
style
guidelines
so
thats
no
surprise
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
excitement
to
try
it
surlys
take
on
the
octoberfest
brew
sometimes
a
brewery
produces
an
octoberfest
just
because
however
surly
rarely
does
anything
just
because
surly
fest
is
made
with
the
same
gusto
as
abrasive
furious
darkness
and
pretty
much
every
other
brew
they
make
fest
tastes
like
no
other
octoberfest
out
there
it
is
unmistakeably
hoppy
yet
not
too
much
so
it
takes
away
from
what
it
is
id
hate
to
call
it
an
ipaesque
octoberfest
but
thats
a
fairly
accurate
description
very
attractive
redbronze
color
and
a
fairly
thick
head
agreeable
aroma
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
pleasant
hint
of
carbonation
of
the
dozens
of
octoberfests
ive
had
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
it
do
so
your
taste
buds
will
appreciate
it
o
really
digging
this
beer
its
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
example
is
welllagered
and
enjoyable
i
do
wonder
what
yeast
strain
they
used
because
it
comes
across
very
well
in
this
beer
and
the
rye
addition
with
restrained
american
hops
dont
know
which
one
also
curious
about
this
create
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
i
feel
like
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
in
my
fridge
every
fall
overall
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
in
the
fall
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
and
the
rye
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
herd
cost
8
99
for
a
4
pack
of
16
oz
cans
o
solid
and
very
drinkable
i
had
2
pints
and
could
have
easily
had
2
more
only
complaint
is
it
was
tough
to
find
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
surly
something
different
to
drink
in
the
sea

surlyfest
pours
a
dark

with
a
small

there
is
a
mellow
sour

aroma
the
taste
has
a
slightly
sour

sharp
rye
like
bite
with
a
nice
hop
bite
very
full
body
yet
very
drinkable
overall
its
a

solid
and
well
crafted
beer
thats
pretty
much
where
it
lines
up
the
rye
spiciness
is
front
and
center
perhaps
to
excess
i
would
have
liked
a
fruitier
finish
to
back
all
of
this
rye
still
its
cleanfinishing
if
a
little
heavy
o
this
is
a
fine
brew
with
a
nice
mix
of
spicy
rye
grain
sweet
malts
and
a
smooth
finish
not
a
traditional
fest
beer
as
i
know
it
but
big
ups
for
putting
a
twist
on
it
this
brewery
is
the
real
deal
apparently
surly
makes
only
interesting
and
top
quality
brews
i
love
this
one
its
like
a
oktoberfest
but
is
spiked
with
rye
malt
and
has
a
unique
vanilla
character
im
not
used
to
in
the
style
the
pour
is
more
bronze
than
orange
mostly
clear
with
an
inch
or
so
of
lasting
white
head
the
nose
is
german
malty
but
with
that
familiar
peppery
rye
kick
and
a
finish
of
fresh
vanilla
beans
cut
open
and
scraped
clean
yum
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
dramatic
on
the
vanilla
and
its
more
toward
the
front
than
the
finish
but
its
still
there
the
malt
balances
out
into
a
nice
german
traditional
marzen
style
this
has
characteristics
of
both
an
ale
and
a
lager
its
crispness
is
remarkable
for
its
complexity
and
its
super
sessionable
strong
carbonation
lightens
up
a
fuller
medium
body
and
the
6
abv
is
just
right
for
me
in
thus
style
overall
a
very
strong
offering
from
surly
i
really
love
the
vanilla
twist
here
o
old
but
still
tasty
some
hops
still
left
howd
i
miss
this
one
i
want
a
fresh
one
i
went
in
expecting
a
typical
marzen
but
this
was
actually
quite
different
a
tasty
rye
lager
a
mostly
clear
darker
amber
pour
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
that
sank
to
a
collar
and
left
a
few
streaks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
sweet
with

pours

with

smell
is
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
spicy
rye
it
essentially
smells
like
your
average
marzen
with
a
little
something
extra
the
flavor
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
it
has
that
great
caramel
malt
flavor
of
a
marzen
but
adds
in
some
awesome
spicy
rye
and
a
bit
of
hops
its
incredibly
fullflavored
but
has
a
nice
clean
finish

is

with

this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
ever
made
i
wish
it
wasnt
just
a
seasonal
as
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
drink
yearround
b
o
easy
drinkin
smooth
taste
really
solid
beer
o
yet
another
winner
from
surly
incredibly
flavourful
and
delicious
this
is
a
session
ale
and
everything
about
it
screams
easy
drinking
deliciousness
o
the
dryhopping
and
rye
helped
lighten
up
the
maltiness
that
is
usually
found
in
oktoberfest
beers
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
also
great
medium
bodied
with
an
excellent
carbonation
level
smooth
buttery
and
well
balanced
with
a
clean
almost
crisp
finish
great
drinkability
on
this
one
wish
i
could
have
been
drinking
this
already
all
during
the
fall
great
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
has
some
unique
characteristics
while
still
maintaining
the
traditional
integrity
of
the
style
well
done
surly
and
thanks
to
noah
for
sending
this
one
out
o
this
tastes
fine
but
instead
of
choosing
a
hoppy
beer
or
a
traditional
festbier
they
made
a
hybrid
that
seems
sort
of
middling
to
me
o
not
bad
very
mild
and
not
overpowering
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
hoppier
take
on
an
octoberfest
with
the
addition
of
rye
it
is
just
enough
different
than
others
in
the
style
but
in
a
positive
fashion
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
o
this
was
a
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
definitely
better
then
most
that
ive
tried
the
style
isnt
my
favorite
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
this
beer
definitely
makes
for
a
nice
autumn
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
style
overall
not
your
average
oktober
much
darkerbigger
and
hoppier
and
i
give
surly
credit
for
that
its
got
less
of
that
classic
clean
spicy
taste
and
more
of
a
hoppy
kick
than
i
expected
most
importantly
surlys
finger
print
is
all
over
this
one
its
got
that
same
finish
i
get
from
a
furious
cynic
bitter
brewer
that
weve
all
grown
to
love
id
still
take
a
furious
or
abrasive
over
this
one
any
day
but
a
very
good
oktober
from
a
top
notch
brewery
o
first
of
all
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
rye
beer
thought
it
was
just
another
oktoberfest
beer
boy
was
i
wrong
very
good
rye
beer
with
big
citrus
notes
and
nice
amount
of
bitterness
oive
really
been
enjoying
this
beer
on
cool
fall
days
the
past
couple
years
like
all
surly
beers
this
beer
will
wake
up
your
taste
buds
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
i
really
like
the
combination
of
rye
flavor
and
the
generous
flavor
of
sterling
hops
biggest
defect
is
the
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
o
not
a
traditional
oktoberfest
style
beer
but
one
thats
perfect
for
fall
days
o
i
expected
more
since
it
was
a
surly
beer
but
once
i
realized
what
this
beer
was
and
is
supposed
to
be
i
appreciated
it
much
more
a
great
traditional
done
very
well
o
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
pound
several
of
without
much
trouble
a
shout
out
to
cpolking
for
the
hook
up
with
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
hoppy
some
pine
taste
is
smooth
hops
rye
flavorful
and
so
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
another
winner
from
surly
damn
i
wish
they
would
distribute
here
final
thoughts
i
knew
going
into
this
one
that
it
wouldnt
be
the
standard
octoberfest
instead
surly
has
taken
the
style
in
a
whole
new
direction
by
adding
hops
lots
of
hops
oh
and
rye
and
the
result
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
able
to
get
your
hands
on
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
that
while
its
in
line
with
the
myriad
of
other
fall
seasonal
beers
it
breaks
out
of
the
mold
a
little
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
a
nice
blend
of
ryes
its
very
drinkable
i
certainly
would
like
another
one
shits
good
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
but
wished
it
was
better
maybe
if
i
would
have
drank
it
in
mid
december
when
i
received
it
from
crass3000
it
would
have
been
imo
a
must
try
keeping
with
just
about
every
surly
beer
ive
had
this
one
is
subtle
easy
drinking
and
highly
sessionable
great
with
just
about
any
meal
really
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
this
one
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mbrausen
for
sending
this
one
my
way
so
i
could
tick
it
and
cassino
for
handing
it
off
to
me
inperson
thanks

with
a
one

offwhite

that
subsided
to
a
minimal

slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
spices
bread
fruit
and
subtle
bitter
hops
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
spices
bread
subtle
fruit
and
bitter
hops
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
was
a
pretty
good
brew
all
of
the
components
you
would
expect
from
this
style
were
there
with
the
spiciness
but
it
also
threw
in
a
marzen
twist
to
keep
you
guessing
on
top
of
that
a
really
well
done
brew
that
i
cant
believe
i
had
never
tried
before
i
suggest
you
try
it
as
well
overall
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
which
was
outstanding
definitely
going
to
grab
some
more
nect
year
cheers
o
another
beer
to
make
me
proud
to
say
im
from
minnesota
o
pretty
decent
beer
again
lagers
arent
my
style
but
this
one
has
nothing
wrong
with
it
o
unlike
any
other
oktoberfest
ive
had
honestly
its
so
fresh
clean
if
u
didnt
tell
me
it
was
an
oktoberfest
style
i
wouldnt
believe
it
really
well
done
ill
drink
it
again
again
another
fine
brew
by
surly
overall
a
solid
oktoberfest
beer
that
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
4pk
of
and
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
in
this
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
above
average
beer
for
this
style
ryeoctoberfest
i
would
diffently
try
this
one
again
and
its
a
perfect
fall

with

3

nice

then
some

additions
to
be

the
hops
dominate
and

i
like
the

its

an
appropriate
marzen
3

t
sweet
bready

come
together
in
a

the

belie
the
tradition

marzens

o
drinkable
beer
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
marzen
i
will
not
reach
for
this
one
but
if
i
wanted
a
unique
amber
lager
with
hops
here
is
where
i
would
go
to
3
5
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
not
a
big
style
of
lagers
but
this
is
delicious
i
appreciate
a
different
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
and
theres
nothing
off
about
this
one
but
the
flavors
really
arent
complimentary
doesnt
have
enough
of
the
good
meladoinin
malt
for
an
oktoberfest
or
to
support
the
rye
spiciness
o
b
in
this
one
i
like
more
hops
and
i
have
never
loved
the
seasonal
lags
but
this
is
much
better
than
most
this
beer
throws
style
out
the
window
and
the
result
is
pure
win
its
a
lager
that
tastes
like
some
kind
of
hoppy
rye
ale
its
extremely
drinkable
and
i
could
drink
this
year
round
ill
have
to
remember
to
get
more
next
fall
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
hold
true
to
style
either
way
its
a
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
4
0
a
fest
beer
i
can
get
behind
rye
and
malts
mix
well
with
the
single
hop
profile
tasty
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
o
this
brew
just
screams
fall
harvest
season
and
drink
me
with
a
beefpumpkinbarley
stew
in
fact
i
think
im
gonna
do
that
tomorrow
night
for
halloween
o
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
this
in
place
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
lager
that
i
would
definitely
get
again
d
this
beer
threw
me
off
in
a
couple
of
places
but
it
was
still
pretty
pleasant
and
tasty
not
at
all
what
expected
and
somewhat
out
of
style
in
my
opinion
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
think
ill
stick
to
other
marzen
lagers
next
year
although
i
cant
get
this
regularly
so
it
doesnt
really
matter
o
overall
a
decent
beer
not
very
complex
but
still
enjoyable
upon
opening
the
can
i
instantly
get
a
whiff
of
dry
hopped
goodness
perfect
it
pours
a
light
bodied
and
creamy
light
hazelnut
brown
in
color
very
translucent
with
a
creamy
beige
head
that
laces
my
snifter
it
looks
like
a
creamy
marzen
the
aromas
are
very
hoppy
featuring
the
traditional
surly
hop
profile
despite
being
dry
hopped
i
get
more
fresh
wet
hops
from
the
nose
with
light
german
malt
and
an
interesting
yeast
strain
the
flavors
are
a
near
perfect
mix
of
fresh
hops
and
malt
the
rye
is
subtle
and
it
does
drink
like
a
light
lager
the
hop
presence
is
really
nice
it
is
very
complex
period
and
especially
for
the
style
like
most
of
their
beers
this
one
was
built
for
a
can
and
has
a
perfect
mouthfeel
it
is
overly
sessionable
and
really
surprised
me
the
complexity
is
unheard
of
for
the
style
id
say
this
is
a
must
try
and
a
nice
upgrade
over
traditional
festbier
that
youll
find
this
time
of
year
big
thanks
to
my
boy
troopscoop
for
the
can
great
artwork
and
color
on
this
can
pours
with
brilliant
clarity
great
lace
and
retention
aroma
of
yeasty
malts
a
bit
of
fruity
esters
and
some
earthy
and
slightly
citrusy
hops
taste
is
light
and
clean
a
bit
of
light
malts
rye
caramel
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
not
really
complex
or
bitter
but
still
an
easy
drinking
brew
the
mouth
is
decent
but
a
touch
over
carbonated
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
pair
with
food
o
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
doesnt
live
u
to
the
hype
like
other
surly
offers
on
the
other
hand
i
feel
like
tempering
my
review
a
little
just
to
keep
it
honest
on
the
other
hand
oh
hell
maybe
i
should
just
join
the
crowd
and
quit
giving
surly
a
hard
time
nah
overall
this
is
one
of
the
top
5
lagers
i
have
ever
had
by
far
the
malt
profile
is
so
complex
with
the
spicy
rye
and
the
toasted
breadiness
but
the
the
ample
hop
profile
and
dry
hopping
also
plays
a
huge
part
in
making
this
a
great
beer
once
again
surly
knows
how
to
make
a
great
beer
really
drinkable
balanced
and
sessionable
during
this
fall
season
but
could
be
consumed
year
round
although
you
would
want
it
fresh
to
appreciate
the
fresh
dry
hop
aromas
and
flavors
highly
recommended
and
should
be
on
every
beer
geeks
bucket
list
in
my
opinion
glad
i
was
able
to
check
it
off
o
very
happy
to
try
this
at
last
another
fantastic
brew
from
surly
not
enough
lagers
in
the
craft
brew
world
so
its
always
nice
to
come
across
a
fabulous
example
cheers
to
todd
and
omar
it
is
a
great
beer
but
i
was
surprised
that
surly
didnt
give
it
a
heavier
rye
taste
overall
another
surly
winner
its
a
unique
take
on
the
fall
seasonal
and
adds
just
enough
rye
to
let
you
know
what
youre
dealing
with
definitely
a
top
fall
seasonal
for
those
who
can
get
it
overall
solid
beer
if
a
bit
unconventional
for
an
oktoberfest
style
i
think
this
would
fly
better
as
a
marzen
with
a
rye
kick
rather
than
a
rye
beer
on
a
marzen
base
overall
a
well
done
ofestrye
beer
however
you
want
to
classify
it
id
say
it
leans
a
little
more
toward
marzen
as
the
rye
is
not
as
prevalent
as
in
say
a
reds
rye
or
cane
ebel
but
definitely
noticeable
gives
this
lager
a
nice
complexity
to
it
along
with
the
the
nice
hoppiness
it
has
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
again
and
would
honestly
probably
buy
a
case
of
it
if
i
lived
in
minnesota
overall
an
interesting
take
on
an
octoberfest
beer
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
it
again
overall
this
is
one
tasty
mug
o
brew
digging
the
rich
maltiness
dangerous
level
f
drinkability
and
great
balance
from
the
hops
surly
does
it
again
overall
is
higher
because
aside
from
the
smell
and
taste
i
consider
this
to
be
more
than
just
good
overall
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
o
solid
for
the
style
and
although
the
hoppy
aroma
teased
my
expectations
for
the
flavor
its
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
very
good
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
with
added
rye
and
hops
this
is
a
good
example
of
style
blending
resulting
in
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
number
of
worth
getting
your
hands
on
to
try
serving
type
can
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
plain
and
simple
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
brew
o
this
is
a
very
fine
fest
beer
very
nice
offering
for
the
fall
actually
this
is
actually
my
favorite
seasonal
for
the
fall
just
outstanding
and
a
joy
to
drink
thanks
for
the
want
andy
overall
i
always
look
forward
to
this
brew
during
the
begining
of
fall
i
have
been
meaning
to
do
a
review
for
manyayears
when
i
took
the
first
sip
of
a
surlyfest
a
little
while
back
i
knew
it
was
an
a
beer
solid
work
overall
a
great
alternative
to
the
traditional
marzen
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
if
i
were
drinking
this
on
tap
my
wallet
would
not
like
me
perfect
for
the
fall
season
and
one
that
i
will
look
forward
to
each
year
o
a
fascinating
idea
of
a
hoppy
rye
octoberfest
the
octoberfest
aspect
gets
slightly
lost
in
the
mix
thats
ok
its
a
tasty
beer
o
im
feeling
fall
every
time
i
crack
a
can
of
this
a
great
beer
for
the
crispness
of
fall
extra
points
for
the
most
aesthically
pleasing
label
on
the
block
overall
this
is
a
great
seasonal
offering
from
surly
different
from
most
of
their
lineup
but
in
a
good
way
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
ba
regardless
of
style
preference
lucky
are
we
who
can
find
fresh
surly
cheers
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
rye
beer
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweetness
spice
and
bitterness
complex
and
tasty
served
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
not
a
stein
unfortunately
lagers
are
obviously
clear
this
being
a
good
example
orange
tan
brown
rust
color
with
a
lighter
head
lacing
does
not
last
long
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
very
nice
smell
mellow
citrusy
and
richness
i
tasted
the
single
hop
sterling
evenly
throughout
with
rich
maltiness
that
has
a
bite
to
it
the
rye
leaves
a
good
impression
slightly
different
from
the
majority
of
oktoberfest
beers
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
thanks
for
the
great
one
todd
head
brewmaster
surly
freshly
brewed
a
nice
coppery
pour
with
a
finger
of
rich
tawny
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
heavy
lacing
rye
grain
and
mostly
citric
hop
on
a
rather
faint
nose
taste
has
an
initial
impression
of
maltgrain
light
sweetness
and
spicy
rye
characteristics
which
are
swept
away
with
a
light
washing
of
citric
hop
that
leaves
only
a
trace
of
maltgrain
for
mostly
clean
dryish
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
very
nicely
carbonated
for
the
style
imparting
a
creamy
yet
crisp
backbone
overall
a
nice
hoppedup
twist
on
the
oktoberfest
style
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
despite
the
smell
and
flavors
being
dominated
by
grains
it
has
layers
of
depth
that
really
impress
me
surly
delivers
again
the
look
of
the
beer
is
fall
gets
me
ready
for
the
shennanigans
to
be
had
outside
under
a
big
tent
lederhosen
sweet

great

when
the
polka
outfit
plays
my

sing
it
with
me
roll
out
the

well
have
a

giving
that
sweet

a
smooch
with
my
handlebar
moustached
lips
ahh
oktoberfest
best
time
of
the
year
enjoy
o
overall
really
really
dig
this
one
id
like
to
try
it
a
bit
fresher
my
bad
that
i
sat
on
it
for
such
a
long
time
but
i
do
really
enjoy
it
with
the
heavy
malt
bill
and
missing
hops
the
sweetness
is
great
almost
barleywine
like
crossed
with
a
marzen
thanks
to
surlytwins
fan
for
the
opportunity
though
the
carbonation
was
a
slight
issue
with
this
one
its
wont
be
keeping
me
away
as
i
cant
wait
to
quaff
more
of
surlys
suds
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
good
will
update
this
review
when
i
get
a
chance
to
try
another
within
a
month
or
two
of
canning
d
quite
drinkable
the
rye
leaves
a
lingering
flavor
and
not
in
a
bad
way
good
but
not
an
everyday
one
for
me
a
great
seasonable
beer
for
autumn
theres
exceptional
carbonation
the
whole
way
through
and
its
light
to
medium
body
is
an
easy
drinker
the
bitter
bite
with
sweetness
that
hangs
at
the
end
isnt
totally
my
thing
but
it
definitely
is
part
of
the
season
cheers
to
surly
for
making
another
one
they
can
hang
their
hat
on
d
for
me
this
was
just
a
mediocre
offering
from
a
fantastic
brewery
i
love
all
things
surly
but
this
one
just
didnt
live
up
nothing
against
surly
this
one
was
just
ok
d
good
beer
d
an
interesting
complex
and
bready
brew
really
good
but
quite
different
this
is
a
tough
one
for
me
to
grade
for
the
style
i
dont
think
it
hits
the
mark
too
much
like
a
malty
ipa
not
sure
if
that
was
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
a
rye
but
it
didnt
work
d
decently
high
i
liked
this
one
but
the
over
the
top
chewiness
got
to
me
over
the
course
of
time
it
was
still
very
nice
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
surly
beers
d
easy
to
drink
beer
for
sure
nothing
crazy
but
just
solid
very
hoppy
for
the
style
with
a
bitter
piney
hop
blast
up
front
which
is
balanced
by
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
im
also
picking
up
slight
hints
of
rye
the
hops
give
off
hints
f
pineapple
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
there
is
a
slight
lactic
creaminess
that
alng
with
the
malt
prfile
make
this
beer
extremely
smoky
and
quaffable
at
least
im
having
this
in
some
partially
appropriate
glassware
it
pours
a
hazy
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
oranges
peach
light
cinnamon
wheat
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
toffee
mint
black
pepper
sourdough
and
light
pine
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
though
i
think
the
rye
goes
somewhat
overlookedunderused
beyond
that
i
could
see
enjoying
this
on
a
regular
basis
in
the
fall
you
lucky
minnesotans
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
finger
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
surprisingly
nice
on
the
hop
aromatics
there
is
a
malt
backer
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
sourness
from
the
rye
itself
the
taste
is
a
slightly
bitter
sour
rye
flavor
along
with
some
spice
that
would
be
associated
with
it
as
well
it
isnt
overwhelming
in
those
regards
there
is
also
flavors
of
some
nice
earthy
hops
im
never
really
a
fan
of
any
bitterness
but
this
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
its
perhaps
one
of
the
most
drinkable
rye
beers
that
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
i
guess
this
is
in
the
marzen
style
even
though
ba
catalogues
it
as
a
rye
beer
very
solid
brew
cheers
the
most
interesting
and
notable
aroma
here
for
me
is
this
leafy
tea
character
its
not
quite
herbal
but
has
a
certain
leafiness
to
it
breadiness
here
as
well
this
tea
flavor
carries
through
to
the
taste
with
some
dried
leaves
malty
herbal
combination
though
the
finish
lowmedium
bodied
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
thanks
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
as
i
sit
here
on
a
cool
saturday
watching
football
i
dont
usually
enjoy
lagers
tasting
this
beer
is
dry
yet
smooth
sweet
sugary
yeasty
bread
pale
malts
and
wellbalanced
bittering
hops
make
this
an
amazing
beer
combo
for
eating
finger
foods
watching
movies
or
just
relaxing
outside
in
a
lawnchair
the
body
is
thin
the
carbonation
is
light
and
smooth
and
this
beer
does
not
destroy
the
palate
at
all
so
perfect
score
for
mouthfeel
at
the
end
of
the
glass
nutmeg
comes
out
of
nowhere
in
the
aroma
making
this
beer
wonderful
down
to
the
last
taste
flavor
has
a
ryelike
spicy
malt
flavor
very
little
toastcaramel
for
an
oktoberfest
inspired
beer
hop
flavors
are
back
with
a
strong
tealike
flavor
there
is
a
slight
tealike
slickness
on
the
mouthfeel
possibly
from
some
diacetyl
this
is
a
unique
beer
with
some
interesting
aspects
to
it
but
it
doesnt
have
the
drinkability
of
a
fest
beer
yet
isnt
exciting
enough
as
an
odball
beer
d
a
decent
rye
beer
but
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
in
the
smell
or
taste
while
not
a
bad
beer
its
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
surly
so
far
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
in
a
trade
id
much
prefer
their
other
offerings
cheers
d
a
rare
miss
for
surly
and
this
one
is
way
off
the
mark
i
know
theyre
trying
to
put
a
different
spin
on
the
oktoberfest
but
this
just
didnt
work
at
all
the
one
pint
can
disappeared
all
too
quickly
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
ofest
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
next
year
fantastic
beer
overall
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
a
socalled
oktoberfest
beer
but
it
was
a
very
satisfying
surprise
first
the
crack
glug
then
the
fireworks
two
foamy
fingers
worth
of
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
an
interesting
admixture
of
grassy
hops
and
a
mild
malty
sweetness
this
was
more
up
my
alley
although
it
was
not
a
traditional
ofest
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
accompanied
by
a
grassiness
in
the
mouth
dang
i
wish
that
they
had
not
mentioned
pretzels
because
i
could
really
go
for
one
right
about
now
finish
was
initially
dry
but
then
the
cool
minty
blast
of
rye
kicked
in
and
i
was
reminded
of
sopor
the
first
person
to
turn
me
on
to
rye
whew
smoooth
more
please
d
a
decent
offering
i
am
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
beer
while
i
enjoyed
my
serving
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
this
beer
presents
the
spicy
and
earthy
characteristics
of
rye
more
than
any
other
beers
ive
had
that
include
this
grain
this
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
seems
very
well
made
all
the
way
around
darn
i
wish
i
could
get
surly
at
my
store
hops
become
very
strong
after
a
few
sips
and
leave
an
intense
aftertaste
whatever
that
hop
is
its
a
killer
a
different
beer
for
those
who
like
unusual
flavors
and
worth
a
taste
the
last
half
of
the
pint
is
the
problem
my
hypothesis
was
correct
taste
brings
forth
a
spicy
bread
with
a
complimentary
hop
character
im
diggin
this
brew
would
go
great
with
a
fresh
philly
soft
pretzel
not
what
i
expected
at
all
in
an
oktoberfest
but
in
a
good
way
d
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
and
not
palate
destroying
this
has
all
the
enjoyablity
of
an
adjunct
lager
with
10x
more
taste
awesome
beer
just
wish
it
had
more
hops
in
the
front
ah
well
i
seek
this
beer
out
every
year
but
i
dont
buy
more
than
a
4
pack
or
maybe
two
that
is
enough
to
hold
me
over
until
next
year
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
it
finishes
cleanly
not
too
dry
there
is
a
forward
grain
flavor
that
i
assume
is
the
rye
the
finish
is
very
nice
very
drinkable
i
would
have
this
again
drinkability
is
great
despite
the
malt
with
the
balance
of
the
rye
this
beer
goes
down
amazingly
smooth
could
definitely
have
a
few
d
good
clean
dry
refreshing
and
full
flavored
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
suited
for
afternoon
quaffing
on
the
patio
true
to
form
this
surly
is
meant
to
be
savored
d
id
rather
drink
this
all
night
than
any
other
fest
very
good
for
a
rye
also
another
great
surly
offering
very
drinkable
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
style
beer
out
there
interesting
take
on
the
oktoberfest
beer
and
i
like
it
more
quality
from
surly
definitely
a
surlycaliber
beer
and
one
that
i
much
prefer
to
most
of
the
marzen
style
octoberfests
that
are
the
standard
easy
drinker
d
heres
to
surly
this
is
quite
different
from
the
typical
fest
beer
so
good
they
could
offer
it
yearround
im
convinced
of
it
surlyfest
its
like
a
party
in
my
mouth
and
everyone
is
invited
very
drinkable
in
fact
perhaps
more
drinkable
on
its
own
without
food
pairings
than
traditional
fest
beers
i
wish
this
had
lower
alcohol
which
would
make
it
an
excellent
session
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
as
a
mainstay
very
sessionable
i
wish
surly
would
make
this
year
round
d
i
think
the
drinkability
is
good
on
the
second
one
the
flavor
became
a
little
blasé
to
me
almost
like
there
was
nothing
more
to
discoversavor
d
just
ok
not
my
favorite
surly
or
oktoberfest
although
it
is
hard
to
compare
because
of
the
rye
nice
for
something
a
little
different
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
surly
beers
ive
had
all
the
year
round
seasonal
and
special
releases
but
this
is
fantastic
the
taste
has
definite
rye
with
some
malt
balance
wants
to
almost
jump
to
your
tongue
and
palate
as
soon
as
you
raise
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pretty
foamy
with
a
good
moderately
easy
to
drink
flavor
can
pours
a
nice
amber
red
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
off
whtie
head
very
clean
and
crisp
looking
very
slight
hop
in
the
nose
but
mostly
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malty
grain
wheat
and
rye
type
aromas
slight
bitter
taste
with
a
nice
balanc
of
malt
flavors
very
reminiscent
of
german
beers
with
a
nice
american
twist
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
medium
outhfeel
very
sessionable
not
sure
if
this
was
5
5
last
year
but
this
year
its
6
2
according
to
the
pamphlet
from
surlyfest
o
surly
never
disappoints
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
oktoberfest
d
very
drinkable
though
not
something
i
would
want
to
mix
with
other
beers
but
rather
just
drink
this
for
a
night
nice
flavor
profile
going
on
here
but
a
really
thick
malt
bill
makes
me
want
only
one
or
two
overall
a
great
twist
on
the
marzen
style
very
flavorful
and
tasty
i
would
love
to
get
this
fresh
on
a
cool
october
afternoon
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
maltiness
of
rye
and
a
bit
sweet
as
for
the
taste
malty
and
sweet
with
a
dry
rye
like
end
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
a
nice
rye
presence
in
an
oktoberfest
quite
nice
d
not
my
favorite
surly
beer
by
any
means
but
fairly
tasty
and
easy
drinking
thanks
to
freshmanpour77
for
this
gracious
throwin
md
a
touch
thin
and
very
dry
easy
drinking
excellent

d
id
like
to
try
this
again
fresh
but
as
it
stands
its
nothing
more
than
average
md
medium
body
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
awhile
but
is
very
easy
to
drink
excellent
for
a
cool
summer
or
fall
night
but
also
is
great
as
a
changeup
beer
in
the
winter
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
very
creamy
overall
a
very
nice
beer
d
i
like
some
of
the
other
surlys
but
this
one
is
too
hoppy
for
a
rye
d
this
beer
has
session
written
all
over
it
i
wish
we
could
get
this
stuff
here
in
denver
with
the
cans
and
all
this
would
be
a
perfect
campingfishingtailgatebbq
beer
a
nice
twist
on
the
traditional
marzen
style
with
some
added
rye
for
a
nice
touch
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
id
hoped
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkability
another
top
notch
surly
beer
a
tasty
marzen
with
a
nice
rye
bite
to
it

interesting
mix
that
surly
pulled
off
very
nicely

the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
with
a
very
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
light
nutty
malt
flavor
is
much
of
the
samesweet
nutty
caramel
malt
some

too
pretty
good
for
an
oktoberfest
md
another
great
brew
from
surly
medium
bodied
very
smooth
tasting
with
a
little
bite
at
the
finish
too
bad
a
seasonal
brew
so
enjoy
a
couple
times
over
when
you
could
a
for
sure
brew
to
be
had
by
the
surly
lovers
out
there
after
having
a
few
surly
products
now
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
as
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
much
else
i
have
had
definitely
something
i
would
buy
again
if
i
could
d
would
be
great
to
take
camping
tailgating
or
to
a
cookout
got
to
try
a
can
of
this
courtesy
of
a
friend
from
minnesota
the
colour
was
golden
straw
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
was
nearly
nonexistent
i
mean
maybe
there
were
some
hops
and
malt
there
but
i
couldnt
detect
any
on
the
palate
there
were
faint
hops
and
faint
malt
but
generally
it
seemed
quite
watery
i
guess
i
expected
more
form
the
folks
who
make
the
darkness
overall
this
beer
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
i
like
that
it
is
a
rye
and
appreciate
that
it
isnt
overhopped
d
is
it
sessionable
yes
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
solid
offering
from
surly
a
wonderful
take
on
the
marzen
style
d
good
full
flavored
lager
perfect
for
a
fall
afternoon
good
and
crisp
at
5
5
this
is
easy
to
have
a
few
and
keep
on
going
good
beer
to
have
after
raking
leaves
or
other
outdoor
fall
chores
think
ill
have
another
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
i
really
want
more
for
the
fall
season
as
it
is
a
great
seasonal
and
when
the
weather
is
right
i
would
love
to
have
this
around
pours
a
dark
amber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
soon
disappears
aroma
is
of
toasted
caramel
and
peat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
rye
flavor
theres
a
medium
hop
bitterness
that
is
discernable
as
well
but
the
rye
is
what
shines
through
decent
drinkability
but
sometimes
it
depends
on
the
setting
with
rye
beers
d
very
high
gimme
another
and
im
glad
i
bought
2
4packs
d
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
i
must
say
that
this
years
batch
is
definitely
my
favorite
so
far
i
didnt
really
care
for
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
in
years
past
due
to
the
overpowering
hoppiness
this
year
the
hops
are
perfect
the
malts
rule
the
beer
and
the
rye
makes
it
much
more
interesting
than
other
oktoberfest
beers
i
would
love
to
drink
this
in
a
1l
stein
while
listening
to
polka
music
and
eating
sausage
i
hope
to
make
it
to
surlyfest
next
year
so
i
can
do
so
ill
be
picking
up
another
4pack
of
this
before
it
sells
out
for
sure
another
great
surly
brew
d
a
very
good
beer
for
the
season
surly
does
it
again
takes
a
style
and
turns
it
into
something
truly
unique
and
good
at
the
same
time
definitely
a
session
brew
for
a
cool
autumn
night
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
with
poor
retention
smell
is
rye
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
and
is
sweeter
than
i
expected
the
malt
is
the
star
in
this
beer
and
really
comes
through
nicely
tastes
of
sweet
malt
in
the
beginning
followed
by
hops
and
rye
at
the
end
nice
balance
there
are
not
enough
os
in
smooth
to
describe
this
beer
nice
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
surlyfest
take
it
this
one
is
good
d
awesome
yet
another
fabulous
beer
from
surly
i
wish
they
would
fix
the
head
a
little
but
it
still
taste
great
delicious
beer
d
highly
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
is
rye
and
caramel
toasted
malts
and
some
good
hop
profile
the
taste
is
very
fresh
this
was
delivered
today
and
was
almost
sold
out
already
its
smooth
and
creamy
with
balanced
hops
and
a
great
rye
flavor
this
one
is
real
easy
to
drink
and
again
surly
pushes
the
envelope
and
creates
a
great
brew
to
represent
a
style
but
is
it
a
marzen
a
rye
a
lager
a
rye
lager
or
a
brown
surly
again
does
it
in
their
style
and
does
it
great
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
light
while
still
maintaining
some
richness
low
abv
and
a
taste
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
am
glad
i
stocked
up
drinkability
fantastic
autumn
beer
while
the
malts
are
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
marzen
the
hops
and
rye
clearly
move
it
well
beyond
marzen
territory
that
said
it
beats
any
traditional
marzen
by
a
wide
margin
this
years
batch
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
this
is
some
good
stuff
try
it
if
you
can
drink
it
if
youve
got
it
its
decent
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
appearance
is
nice
as
all
surlys
are
looks
clean
and
well
put
together
smell
and
taste
are
very
similar
a
decent
amount
of
rye
but
also
kinda
woody
and
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
had
again
3
years
later
and
it
was
fresh
and
it
may
have
been
tweaked
got
more
toast
and
hop
aromas
a
good
lager
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
drink
it
again
if
it
was
available
local
d
very
drinkable
if
only
this
wasnt
my
only
one
i
likey
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
with
the
surlyfest
several
things
about
this
beer
stand
out
as
very
good
and
make
me
want
to
hunt
is
down
agian
no
matter
what
the
trouble
very
well
balanced
flavors
and
aroma
bitterness
level
is
just
about
perfect
for
this
beer
couple
that
with
the
low
alcohol
and
we
have
a
winner
very
happy
i
got
the
chance
to
sample
this
i
forget
who
sent
this
one
to
me
but
thanks
a
16
ounce
can
pulled
from
the
back
of
my
dbf
and
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
a
rather
aggressive
pour
unveils
a
hazed
rich
apricot
colored
brew
with
about
three
fingers
of
creamy
fluffy
light
ecru
foam
a
stellar
pour
smells
and
tastes
of
bittersweet
spicy
caramelized
malts
biscuits
and
an
awesome
citrus
tinged
hop
presence
lemon
and
grapefruit
a
memorable
lager
to
say
the
least
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
try
this
one
if
you
can
its
a
good
beer
with
a
good
lager
flavor
but
its
not
as
complex
as
i
was
somehow
expecting
i
would
prefer
a
good
german
lager
with
a
crisper
bite
drinkability
entirely
too
easy
to
put
this
one
down
its
a
little
on
the
high
end
for
a
pure
session
beer
but
id
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
few
its
too
bad
i
dont
normally
have
access
to
surlys
beers
because
id
be
excited
to
try
more
of
them
if
i
had
the
opportunity
id
have
this
again
overall
thanks
go
to
scoobydank
for
being
so
kind
as
to
hook
me
up
with
this
one
this
beer
was
great
i
would
definately
drink
it
again
d
the
cereal
grain
base
gives
the
beer
a
bready
base
that
is
pleasant
to
sip
on
id
like
a
little
more
rye
to
peak
through
though
wow
i
like
rye
beers
and
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
examples
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
goes
down
smooth
and
this
one
disappeared
before
i
realized
what
was
happening
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
it
would
easily
be
one
of
my
goto
brews
d
a
very
tasty
take
on
the
style
another
great
surly
beer
burnt
orange
color
with
nice
head
smell
is
of
hops
and
orange
peel
with
malt
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
backing
of
hops
and
that
distinct
rye
flavor
that
ive
come
to
love
mouthfeel
is
good
pretty
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
these
at
once
this
beer
has
great
balance
and
flavor
i
could
drink
these
year
round
too
bad
its
only
a
seasonal
16oz
can
thanks
to
stopbarking
nice
dark
orangebrown
good
head
and
lacing
looks
nice
the
smell
is
really
cool
rye
hops
fruit
the
taste
is
fruity
and
pretty
good
as
well
and
i
dont
know
what
style
this
is
i
dont
think
ive
had
an
average
surly
beer
yet
all
good
drinkability
hits
all
the
right
notes
though
with
a
few
missteps
alcohols
not
an
issue
at
all
and
the
mouthfeel
and
backing
aromasflavors
are
very
nice
i
just
think
the
can
may
have
been
a
little
off
regardless
theres
a
good
beer
so
give
it
a
shot
i
got
this
can
from
johnbierman
as
an
extra
very
appreciated
and
im
so
happy
to
have
another
surly
beer
to
try
this
is
difficult
to
rate
against
any
given
style
a
dryhopped
rye
helles
lager
the
beer
is
copper
colored
and
a
little
hazy
with
a
thick
rocky
3finger
foam
that
recedes
into
a
thin
wet
frothy
film
the
first
smell
that
hits
me
is
rye
spice
followed
by
bready
and
malty
helles
lager
aromas
straight
outta
munchen
exceptional
and
the
taste
is
even
better
if
only
because
helles
lagers
seem
stronger
in
flavor
than
aroma
at
least
to
me
delicious
biscuit
malty
sweet
with
distinctive
rye
bite
and
a
sharp
aftertaste
that
lingers
the
body
is
creamy
and
filling
this
is
as
drinkable
as
any
beer
ive
had
before
an
instant
classic
this
beer
is
unique
and
needs
to
exist
a
near
perfect
beverage
mouthfeel
is
yeasty
medium
bodied
and
spicy
thanks
again
this
and
furious
make
me
ache
that
surly
isnt
available
as
wide
as
jersey
this
beer
was
included
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
dbhog
since
i
did
not
have
a
stein
on
hand
as
the
label
suggested
i
just
decided
to
put
it
in
a
duvel
glass
instead
color
is
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
aroma
has
some
dry
grainy
husks
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
traces
of
fruit
here
and
there
slightly
musty
as
well
taste
brings
on
more
of
the
same
but
more
subdued
overall
taste
also
clues
you
in
that
this
is
a
lager
and
not
an
ale
in
the
way
that
all
of
its
conponents
intermingle
good
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
lend
itself
well
to
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
at
the
same
time
one
is
good
enough
for
me
a
good
beer
from
surly
and
much
more
refined
than
their
other
brews
again
like
all
of
their
other
products
i
wish
i
had
access
to
them
here
thanks
again
to
bill
for
this
one
m
d
feel
is
alright
medium
bodies
but
the
flavour
doesnt
go
over
with
it
very
well
i
have
been
fond
of
the
other
rye
beer
i
have
had
so
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
go
based
on
that
but
im
not
too
interested
in
getting
another
any
time
soon
d
this
is
a
great
collaboration
of
rye
hoppy
and
ofest
great
flavors
and
lager
quaffability
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
great
lakes
elliot
ness
well
done
overall
and
something
i
would
like
to
trade
for
next
time
it
comes
around
pours
a
barely
foggy
and
slightly
orange
hued
amber
nose
is
mild
citrus
tones
and
mild
hop
characteristics
as
well
flavor
has
that
rye
bite
but
it
seems
like
its
blended
with
a
fairly
intense
citrus
and
pine
hop
edge
nice
marriage
feel
has
a
fairly
obvious
carbonation
thats
full
in
the
mouth
this
is
easy
to
drink
yes
but
it
still
carries
the
bite
you
expect
from
a
rye
md
very
nice
balance
of
all
of
the
above
to
make
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
brew
id
love
to
get
more
of
this
nice
orange
somewhat
golden
color
very
clean
looking
tight
creamy
head
on
top
very
hoppy
aroma
for
the
style
nice
malty
sweetness
to
it
a
heavy
blast
of
hops
good
balance
between
the
2
with
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
very
silky
and
creamy
mouthfeel
all
around
a
great
drinking
experience
my
first
from
surly
and
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
sure
d
very
nice
fest
beer
with
an
american
twist
solid
brew
well
worth
getting
very
creative
by
dry
hopping
an
oktoberfest
drindability
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
it
goes
down
way
to
easy
i
could
put
down
4
or
5
of
these
d
very
drinkable
for
those
who
like
more
malts
with
their
hops
this
is
the
one
for
you
ahhhh
i
dont
know
right
now
the
overall
score
here
is
really
good
but
i
cant
go
with
it
i
really
like
surly
stuff
but
this
isnt
one
a
their
best
imho
so
so
head
no
lace
slightly
hazy
orangish
amber
color
hoppy
nose
flavor
picks
up
malt
a
bit
of
roastiness
helps
make
it
more
drinkable
sort
of
an
oktoberfest
i
guess
finish
is
ok
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
but
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
again
from
surly
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
get
a
good
amount
of
hops
without
shredding
your
tongue
or
getting
to
be
too
much
highly
recommend
will
definitely
seek
out
again
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
a
rye
lager
thing
is
a
nice
take
on
a
style
aside
from
marzen
for
the
oktoberfest
season
a
great
alternative
when
marzens
get
boring
the
extra
hop
presence
in
here
is
pretty
nice
certainly
one
worth
picking
up
a
good
one
for
those
seeking
just
a
touch
more
flavor
and
body
at
the
autumn
barbeque

some

this
one
is
a
nice

spin
on
a
marzen
great
session
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
a
couple
of
months
ago
wait
til
next
year
isnt
just
for
the
cubs
drinks
extremely
well
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
head
holds
for
a
bit
and
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
loads
of
rye
not
very
typical
of
an
ofest
but
interesting
very
peppery
and
mildly
sweet
taste
is
much
the
same
lots
of
peppery
very
spicy
loads
of
rye
pretty
damn
dry
has
a
very
earthy
taste
and
feel
body
is
medium
to
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
as
the
head
dissipates
light
sticky
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
subtle
if
nothing
else
smells
like
a
well
balanced
slightly
bready
beer
with
a
note
of
hops
but
not
too
overwhelming
i
was
expecting
a
terrapin
rye
pale
type
taste
and
that
may
have
clouded
my
judgement
here
it
did
resemble
terrapin
in
the
rye
factor
but
the
hops
are
a
little
more
laid
down
which
is
totally
fine
i
was
just
expecting
more
of
a
sharpness
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
sense
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
well
done
surly
d
very
easy
to
drink
flavorful
goodlooking
sessionable
strength
disappeared
far
too
quickly
another
fine
effort
by
surly
is
it
too
early
to
put
in
my
order
for
a
4pack
next
fall
nick
md
a
fine
brew
a
nice
sessionable
canned
beer
nice
flavor
would
be
a
nice
wind
down
brew
after
some
sort
of
manual
labor
like
a
game
of
baseball
or
something
easy
down
and
quite
refreshing
overall
ok
pours
a
nice
copperyamber
color
slight

foamy
beige

quickly
into
a
foamy
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
minimal

left
behind
lots
of
piney
hops
on
the
nose
of
this
one
and
a
candylike
malty
sweetness
i
was
thinking
i
might
not
really
get
the
rye
in
this
beer
having
had
precious
few
rye
beers
but
its
there
in
abundance
really
spicy
kick
peppery
and
nicely
balanced
with
the
sweet
malt
flavor
mediumbodied
some
faint
yet
longlasting
lingering
bitter
flavors
this
is
excellent
and
that
abv
makes
this
very
sessionworthy
my
first
surly
beer
very
impressive
certainly
a
unique
concoction
alelike
character
but
a
lager
type
feel
fruity
spicy
and
hoppy
and
still
a
lager
surly
again
breaks
all
the
rules
to
bring
us
an
extremely
flavourful
and
festively
drinkable
hopped
up
falltype
beer
recommended
i
like
it
but
its
definitely
got
some
rye
kick
to
it
a
tasty
maltiness
to
it
and
a
definitely
nice
rye
and
spice
charachter
from
the
yeast
however
i
do
have
a
slight
problem
with
this
beer
however
tasty
the
individual
characteristics
are
it
doesnt
come
together
all
that
great
and
it
gives
a
lemonadey
type
flavor
as
a
part
of
the
combination
its
brief
between
the
rye
spiciness
at
the
start
and
the
yeast
character
at
the
lingering
finish
it
hurts
the
drinkability
alot
when
it
comes
to
brewing
lowish
alcohol
beers
that
have
huge
flavor
surly
cannot
be
topped
best
lager
ever
its
pretty
damn
close
stupidly
drinkable
great
drinkability
this
works
far
better
as
a
rye
beer
than
an
oktoberfest
to
be
sure
ddrinkability
is
good
it
s
unusual
to
drink
an
oktoberfestseasonal
beer
that
is
so
hopcentric
but
refreshingly
so
will
certainly
wait
for
this
again
next
year
certainly
different
and
pretty
good
for
an
oktoberfest
type
beer
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
traditional
type
worth
a
try
for
its
uniqueness
but
not
my
first
choice
d
though
this
was
certainly
a
nontraditional
festbier
it
had
a
lot
going
for
it
i
really
appreciated
the
hop
flavors
and
the
addition
of
the
rye
sort
of
combined
the
clean
flavors
of
a
lager
with
some
of
the
best
attributes
of
an
ale
delicious
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
the
ofest
style
surly
comes
through
again
even
though
this
beer
isnt
really
in
the
same
league
as
most
of
their
other
outstanding
offerings
its
still
light
years
better
than
similar
lagers
actually
there
arent
any
similar
lagers
surlyfest
is
both
unique
and
delicious
talk
about
a
killer
combination
drinkability
i
wish
i
lived
in
minnesota
d
totally
this
is
definitely
not
what
i
expected
from
a
rye
beer
or
a
fest
beer
for
that
matter
nonetheless
its
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
highly
recommend
thanks
again
for
the
cans
brian
zum
wohl
overall
a
pretty
wild
oktoberfest
i
only
wish
surly
was
in
ohio
the
innovation
i
continue
to
see
coming
out
of
this
small
minneapolis
brewery
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
these
surly
folks
are
incredible
keep
em
coming
touch
more
rye
twang
in
the
fresh
stuff
maybe
some
honeyish
notions
but
both
have
a
considerable
talcum
drying
effect
leading
the
way
to
zesty
juiciness
a
feels
more
grainier
then
b
but
both
powder
on
the
hops
not
an
intense
bitterness
but
very
constant
after
the
brief
unfamiliarity
in
the
beginning
all
left
turns
once
you
get
past
the
intersection
of
rye
malt
my
tongue
is
a
bit
numb
to
boot
pretty
drinkable
another
nice
surly
brew
d
near
excellence
in
this
beer
certainly
is
not
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
we
certainly
are
not
in
germany
an
excellent
americanized
take
on
the
style
the
flavors
are
restrained
however
are
well
crafted
this
beer
truely
embodies
balance
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
im
sure
surly
thoroughly
disregarded
it
which
is
exactly
why
i
enjoy
drinking
their
beer
cheers
d
this
is
an
excellent
brew
typical
of
surly
it
is
completely
unique
this
is
a
unique
beer
worth
a
try
the
little
angry
german
guy
on
the
can
is
the
best
anyway
another
outstanding
beer
from
surly
not
sure
this
beer
qualifies
as
a
marzen
but
if
so
it
is
the
best
american
made
version
ive
had
this
season
another
very
good
beer
from
surly
smell
has
a
wonderful
hoppy
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
even
better
rye
flavor
comes
through
well
outstanding
flavors
and
balance
creamy
mouthfeel
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
not
the
dryness
i
expectedfeared
it
is
a
filling
beer
so
i
couldnt
have
had
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
even
if
i
wanted
too
surlyfest
2008
vintage
appearance
is
mostly
clear
amberorange
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
good
lacing
aroma
has
some
citrus
hops
and
bready
malt
neither
too
strong
with
the
hops
dominating
initially
the
flavors
had
me
scratching
my
head
for
sometime
because
i
thought
i
was
drinking
an
americanized
oktoberfest
so
i
was
relieved
to
see
the
heading
here
as
a
rye
beer
i
tasted
restrained
citrus
hop
flavor
with
the
bready
malt
but
the
malt
flavors
danced
on
my
tounge
for
only
a
moment
and
was
whisked
away
in
a
fairly
dry
finish
which
is
explained
by
the
rye
malt
and
normally
tends
to
be
a
palate
cleanser
when
added
to
beer
leaving
a
pretty
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
right
in
the
middle
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
unlike
any
beer
ive
tried
before
because
it
does
remind
you
of
oktoberfest
but
youve
got
interesting
twists
with
the
american
hops
and
rye
malt
oh
and
of
course
its
absolutely
delicious
notes
if
i
were
to
review
it
as
a
marzen
itd
do
very
poorly
it
has
none
of
the
characteristics
i
expect
from
one
yes
you
gotta
drink
outside
the
box
but
theres
a
reason
i
like
my
marzens
and
this
beer
does
not
deliver
on
that
front
also
criticizing
this
beer
for
being
hoppier
than
most
rye
beers
is
pointless
cos
it
delivers
whats
advertised
on
the
can
and
that
is
this
beers
usp
overall
im
very
impressed
with
my
foray
into
surly
brewing
thanks
to
maximum12
i
look
forward
to
snagging
any
more
of
their
brews
any
chance
i
get
overall
i
thought
this
was
seimply
excellent
by
far
the
best
fest
i
have
had
this
year
so
far
simply
amazingly
sessionable
and
just
really
a
superb
beer
all
around
surly
really
is
one
of
the
best
and
this
just
goes
to
show
it
oh
my
god
was
this
good
or
maybe
the
whole
rye
kick
i
have
been
on
but
yes
alass
this
is
the
beer
that
i
rememberd
from
last
year
super
hoppy
nose
just
like
all
surly
beers
mmm
can
smell
it
now
good
brownish
red
color
then
to
the
taste
mmm
mmm
delicious
with
the
rye
bite
and
the
dryness
of
the
rest
man
is
it
nice
to
live
in
mn
now
i
could
easily
drink
this
every
night
but
then
i
am
on
kind
of
a
rye
kick
so
that
might
not
last
drinkability
i
still
cant
get
over
that
this
is
a
lager
it
is
so
fruity
and
lacks
that
lager
twang
eminently
quaffable
and
i
ask
where
are
the
other
lowabv
session
beers
of
the
world
ive
had
a
couple
of
excellent
ones
lately
bitter
brewer
leatherlips
lost
sailor
but
theyre
exceptions
rather
than
the
norm
id
love
to
see
some
more
tasty
complex
nonrunothemill
beers
that
i
can
drink
still
drive
home
brewers
ill
hoist
this
as
another
example
thanks
guys
the
color
is
a
dark
wheat
color
of
autumn
leaves
this
beer
just
smacks
of
fall
across
the
board
aroma
is
breathtaking
floral
malty

the
rye
hoppy
sweetsmelling
bittersmelling
all
at
the
same
time
extremely
inviting
sunny
rye
flavor
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
nice
amounts
of
hops
as
wlel
in
the
taste
though
not
as
evident
as
they
were
in
the
aroma
floral
notes
come
through
here
nicely
mediumbodied
and
somewhat
robustly
creamy
as
well
at
the
same
time
is
is
extraordinarily
smooth
and
not
at
all
too
weighty
an
autumn
delight
ive
been
craving
this
one
for
9
months
better
stock
up
for
the
release
next
year
d
i
could
toss
these
back
no
problem
and
i
probably
will
a
unique
twist
on
the
fest
beers
and
really
nice
instead
of
the
same
malty
fests
that
we
all
know
two
inches
of
creamy
light
tan
head
that
turn
rocky
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
as
it
slowly
fades
body
is
an
attractive
honey
dark
amber
nose
is
more
on
the
hoppy
side
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
it
includes
a
grassy
malty
backround
with
some
green
tea
notes
enters
the
mouth
with
destinct
lengthy
tones
of
rye
and
minersl
based
hops
the
slightly
rustic
bitterness
is
smooth
and
welcome
bold
yet
sesionable
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
creating
a
very
tasty
mouthfeel
super
easy
to
drink
all
around
this
would
stack
up
well
with
many
foods
thanks
again
eric
poured
amber
with
a
good
head
that
stuck
around
smelled
super
fresh
and
a
bit
grainy
with
some
spicy
rye
notes
and
subtle
aromas
of
apple
and
pear
tasted
really
frsh
and
clean
as
well
with
some
more
rye
graininess
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
for
the
style
but

a
deep
slightly
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
big
semisweet
malt
rye
with
some
dry
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
big
rich
malt
with
the
typical
rye
taste
and
some
light
dry
hops
at
the
end
full
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
refreshing
beer
but
also
very
filling
which
mean
i
wouldnt
have
that
much
in
a
session
also
i
was
expecting
a
hop
bomb
as
this
brewery
is
quite
good
at
those
but
this
is
somewhat
close
to
the
original
style
doktoberfest
not
fest
whatever
it
is
from
surly
so
you
can
only
expect
hops
to
be
present
a
cool
interpretation
albiet
blasphemous
of
the
style
regardless
i
really
enjoy
it
and
if
was
able
would
certainly
have
this
every
fall
when
it
is
released
nice
i
can
only
imagine
those
hops
a
popping
when
this
was
6
months
younger
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
rye
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
again
highly
recommended
drinkability
great
drinkability
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
thanks
goes
out
to
pitmonkey
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
pours
a
fairly
hazy
dark
copper
to
amber
color
one
finger
creamy
offwhite
head
that
thins
quickly
leaving
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
understated
piney
hops
and
yeast
dominate
but
i
get
some
floral
esters
as
well
the
taste
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
surprise
as
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
lager
the
rye
is
big
up
front
and
the
finish
is
caramel
malts
and
herbal
hop
flavors
with
a
bit
more
pine
though
a
little
dusty
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
carbonation
that
matches
the
head
seen
when
poured
when
very
cold
the
feel
is
light
and
dry
with
some
bite
that
moderates
by
the
end
of
the
glass
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
very
drinkable
especially
being
a
rye
lager
this
is
probably
due
to
the
ipaish
character
that
it
seemed
to
have
another
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
from
surly
pours
a
gorgeous
autumnal
amber
color
with
a
big
sudsy
lace
inducing
head
smell
is
fresh
and
vibrant
and
wow
there
are
actually
big
fresh
hops
in
this
oktoberfest
smell
is
hoppy
yet
apples
and
sweet
malt
as
well
amazing
for
a
style
i
usually
find
pretty
average
taste
is
nice
and
mildish
aside
from
a
decent
dose
of
grassy
hopping
and
a
nice
bitterness
level
easy
on
the
malt
and
not
a
sweet
or
tart
oktoberfest
like
im
used
to
but
more
mildly
sharp
and
zesty
perhaps
from
the
crystal
rye
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
palatewise
although
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
a
great
unique
oktoberfest
although
i
would
actually
like
a
hint
more
sweetness
here
big
thanks
for
the
can
tyler
pours
a
deep
amberbronze
color
with
lots
of
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
great
lacing
takes
a
while
to
pour
it
all
in
the
stein
with
all
that
head
pouring
out
of
the
can
smells
quite
hoppy
for
an
oktoberfest
with
amarillo
hops
taking
a
commanding
presence
as
well
as
some
honey
lemon
and
caramel
taste
is
also
way
different
than
i
would
expect
with
rye
jumping
right
out
at
you
followed
by
some
honey
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
lemon
citrusiness
a
nice
sweet
toffee
backbone
with
a
big
ole
piney
hop
finish
medium
in
body
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
an
unexpecting
beer
but
very
drinkable
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
often
in
the
fall
or
any
other
season
whether
or
not
you
call
this
an
oktoberfest
marzen
an
interpretation
of
a
marzen
or
just
some
strange
abortion
of
the
style
i
think
that
is
damn
tasty
for
what
it
is
and
would
keep
this
in
my
fridge
full
time
during
the
fall
months
if
i
had
access
to
it
oh
is
this
drinkable
a
wonderful
hoppy
yet
balanced
brew
very
creativeunique
since
im
a
confirmed
surly
nut
i
love
the
twist
that
theyve
brought
to
an
ofest
certainly
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
this
is
the
first
beer
from
surly
that
i
have
not
enjoyed
i
see
others
have
so
drink
up
but
i
will
pass
on
this
next
fall
unless
they
try
a
new
hop
like
columbus
or
palisade
or
simcoe
my
opinion
is
that
furious
is
10
times
better
than
this
notes
never
thought
id
try
a
dryhopped
rye
octoberfest
lager
very
creative
stuff
and
more
importantly
quite
good
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
offwhite
creamy
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
hoppy
nice
touch
of
the
rye
bitter
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
nice
touch
of
rye
bitterness
and
some
caramel
medium
body
this
brew
is
pretty
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
very
tasty
though
very
drinkable
really
like
this
one
highly
recommended
thanks
megan
d
very
easy
to
put
back
could
be
a
very
sessionable
beer
if
it
were
more
available
dbest
example
of
a
octoberfest
beer
that
i
can
think
of
definitely
a
surly
twist
using
those
hops
to
round
out
this
beer
i
wish
more
octoberfest
beers
used
hops
like
this
drinkability
is
great
this
is
extremely
sessionable
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
take
on
the
oktoberfest
rye
beer
styles
i
really
like
it
and
would
make
this
a
staple
in
the
fridge
and
in
the
outdoors
if
this
was
available
here
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
somewhat
foggy
rich
copper
hue
with
a
generous
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
has
no
intentions
of
leaving
beautiful
lacing
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
crisp
rye
up
front
with
a
subtle
fresh
citric
hop
scent
nice
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aroma
as
well
some
dirty
earth
hops
find
their
way
in
the
nose
too
wow
what
a
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
malt
on
the
tongue
sweet
grapefruit
hops
balance
with
a
creamy
caramel
malt
the
crisp
rye
gives
a
fresh
zing
in
the
mouth
a
spicy
pepper
sting
finds
its
way
in
the
mouth
as
well
aftertaste
is
an
interesting
combination
of
toasted
nut
and
pine
hops
niiice
fluffy
light
to
medium
body
with
a
full
carbonation
this
doesnt
exactly
fit
into
the
traditional
fest
beers
but
thats
why
i
like
it
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
during
the
oktoberfest
season
especially
for
hop
lovers
line
em
up
ill
put
em
down
scary
good
drinkability
what
a
great
beer
experience
i
would
take
this
beer
over

another

the

seems
to
grow
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
coupled
with
a
sort
of
pine
menthol
note
but
not
in
the
typical
american
hop
way
this
becomes
the
dominant
though
not
quite
defining
characteristic
of
this
brew
if
you
hadnt
guessed
this
really
is
quite
hoppy
definitely
a
hop
dominated
brew
sort
of
like
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
malty
oktoberfest
quite
tasty
a
really
enjoyable
brew
and
i
am
glad
they
did
not
brew
another
typical
oktoberfest
while
i
do
enjoy
a
well
crafted
traditional
one
truly
great
ones
are
few
and
far

perhaps
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
hops
get
in
the
way
of
really
noticing
the
rye
character
solid
feel
to
it
medium

extremely

truly
believe
surly
needs
to
have
an

contract
brew
for
them

overall
ever
since

sent
over
the
surly
brews
i
have
been
getting
surly
i
have
to
admit
that
i
saved
this
one
for
last
as
i
tend
to
lean
toward
the
hoppy
brews
being
a
fest
beer
i
expected
pure
malt
i
have
never
been
so
wrong
in
my
life
they
have
taken
an
oktoberfest
brew
and
made
it
sooo
much
more
hops
and
malts
are
both
noted
in
pure
balance
i
profess
there
is
not
a
greater
fest
brew
in
the
world
surly
could
hang
their
hat
on
this
one
yet
there
are
sooo
many
others

i
say

and
a

backdrop
its
tastes
great
nice
a
hoppy
with
a
great
citrus
sweet

character
this
is
a
great
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
a
ncie
carbonation
level
to
balance
out
the
flavors
great
beer
wonderful
citrus
and
pine

aromas
waft
forth
immediately
this
brew
declares
itself
as
not
your
usual
oktoberfest
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
tangy
and
delicious
the
tart
and
complex
hop
flavors
really
dominate
here
to
delicious
although
styleclashing
effect
the
malt
definitely
keeps
to
the
backgroundor
rather
the
dry
and
tangy
rye
malt
is
th
emajor
player
the
effect
is
a
delicious
highly
drinkable
crisp
dry
ale
with
a
long
bitter
flavorful
finish
i
love
it
whatever
it
is
final
note
ive
never
had
a
marzen
with
this
much
hop
flavor
good
beer
for
a
hophead
fest
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
certainly
a
different
version
of
a
marzen
but
enjoyable
now
can
somebody
just
hook
me
up
with
a
bottle
of
darkness
when
the
15th
rolls
around
next
month
please
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
surly
never
really
follows
the
style
specs
always
tending
to
be

more

shows
up
anything
from
germany
in
my
mind
i
could
certainly
drink
many
steins
of
this
thanks
jenn
this
is
a
much
more
hopped
up
version
of
this
style
which
was
quite
enjoyable
considering
most
of
of
the
time
you
get
the
same
old
thing
from
an
oktoberfest
nontraditional
but
recommended
to
those
who
like
hop
flavor
drinkability
im
not
sure
how
to
say
it
but
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
they
come
its
so
crisp
and
clean
and
goes
down
so
easy
the
alcohol
isnt
staggering
high
so
it
would
make
a
great
session
brew
for
those
long
oktoberfest
nights
thanks
again
to
mnstorm99
for
the
opportunity
di
know
there
are
mixed
opinions
on
this
beer
i
am
rating
it
as
a
beer
and
not
an
ofest
as
a
beer
it
is
outstanding
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
packing
my
fridge
with
and
reaching
for
every
day
i
love
the
hop
flavor
of
this
and
the
spicy
maltiness
complements
it
perfectly
i
like
furious
and
that
has
its
place
too
but
i
feel
this
is
a
better
beer
overall
im
extremely
impressed
drinkability
is
fandangtastic
on
this
one
it
is
very
smooth
and
slides
down
easily
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
get
it
if
you
can
my
favorite
surly
offering
no
but
this
is
yet
another
very
solid
beer
from
the
guys
in
brooklyn
center
i
love
the
incorporation
of
rye
and
could
care
less
what
style
this
is
supposed
to
fit
into
well
worth
seeking
a
couple
cans
out
good
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
my
doubts
from
reading
other
reviews
considering
surly
is
so
highly
regarded
but
this
is
very
nice
up
there
along
the
lines
of
the
other
great
surly
brews
this
beer
really
disturbs
me
pours
a
very
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
finely
grained
head
it
may
look
like
a
typical
oktoberfest
but
its
anything
but
the
nose
clean
and
hoppy
with
plenty
of
citrus
but
with
a
nice
malty
body
in
the
background
to
balance
the
hops
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
downright
delicious
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
velvet
awesome
overall
a
very
clean
tasting
lager
with
an
intesting
twist
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
while
taking
the
style
to
the
next
level
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
drink
several
of
throughout
a
whole
evening
and
not
have
the
urge
to
drink
anything
else
i
know
that
the
fact
that
i
like
this
beer
more
than
any
other
ofest
ive
had
simply
because
of
the
hoppiness
means
im
a
hophead
but
im
calling
like
i
taste
it
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
light
carbonation
medium
body
the
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
its
too
bad
all
my
local
stores
are
out
of
it
i
was
hoping
to
snag
at
least
another
pack
the
flavors
are
in
great
balance
and
everything
about
the
beer
screams
drink
me
this
is
surlys
best
allaround
beer
drinkabilty
is
great
this
is
a
darn
fine
octoberfest
beer
well
balanced
tasty
and
highly
enjoyable
glad
i
have
another
can
i
still
dont
know
where
i
stand
on
this
one
its
good
but
for
an
octoberfest
what
to
say
just
like
the
others
of
the
surly
line
ive
sampled
an
overall
solid
impeccably
drinkable
beer
that
satisfies
not
immensly
complex
but
it
is
a
lager
after
all
thick
with
caramel
and
toasty
cereal
grain
the
allspice
i
thought
was
in
the
nose
is
no
longer
prevelant
creamy
with
complimentary
carbonation
good
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
and
again
nice
and
spicey
with
a
nougat
type
finish
yet
dry
maybe
this
is
more
complex
than
i
notice
all
i
can
say
is
another
top
notch
beer
from
a
top
notch
brewery
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
unique
take
on
an
oktoberfest
and
one
i
would
certainly
love
to
come
back
to
if
they
sold
it
in
ma
you
could
easily
throw
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
nicely
done
surly
baaaa
baaa
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
ofest
but
what
else
could
it
be
i
guess
if
it
needs
a
style
not
your
average
oktoberfest
beer
but
i
loved
it
keep
it
up
surly
hope
to
see
you
outside
of
minnesota
soon
poured
into
a
stuttgarter
hofbrau
stein
as
per
the
instructions
on
the
can
this
brew
pours
a
clear
copper
color
the
head
is
massive
firm
and
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
explosive
spice
rye
and
noble
hops
a
hint
of
green
apple
and
pear
with
a
soft
biscuity
undertone
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
the
aroma
biscuits
appear
then
quicky
fade
as
a
hint
of
caramel
comes
through
then
that
fades
and
a
nice
lively
spiciness
shines
then
some
firm
bitterness
arrives
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
creamy
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
surly
beers
it
seems
to
walk
the
line
between
being
an
extreme
beer
and
being
a
tradintional
beer
whatever
it
was
intended
to
be
it
is
wonderful
pours
a
deep
burned
orange
with
2
fingers
of
soapy
white
head
that
dies
slowly
i
know
this
is
a
marzen
but
i
know
its
a
surly
marzen
which
makes
alll
the
difference
smells
of
piney
hops
citrus
rye
and
malty
ooooh
yeah
tastes
of
juicy
piney
hops
malty
balance
and
delicious
rye
this
is
the
brilliant
nectar
named
furious
but
tamed
down
with
more
flavors
if
i
could
make
a
perfect
octoberfest
beer
to
suit
my
hophead
tastes
it
would
be
almost
as
good
as
this
medium
in
the
mouth
with
the
perfect
tickle
of
carbonation
drinkability
if
i
had
a
case
of
this
i
would
drink
non
stop
and
end
up
in
a
hospital
and
it
would
be
so
worth
it
i
had
this
once
last
year
on
tap
this
years
version
seems
to
have
much
more
rye
flavor
than
last
years
which
i
seem
to
recall
as
more
grassy
and
pilsnerlike
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
its
great
to
have
another
surly
in
cans
kudos
to
the
bavarian
colors
of
the
can
drinkable
and
then
some
enough
said
damn
solid
ofest
by
surly
grab
your
lederhosen
a
big
ol
mug
pour
a
bunch
of
this
in
and
sing
yourself
a
song
until
you
fall
asleep
and
do
it
again
another
home
run
for
master
omar
and
the
wily
fellows
at
urly
but
the
bier
yum
this
beer
kicks
butt
a
nice
copperamber
hue
with
a
small
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
definitely
shows
its
dry
hopping
it
smells
like
rye
barley
malt
piney
green
hops
spices
unidentified
citrus
and
earth
the
taste
really
showcases
the
hops
with
all
sorts
of
great
flavors
ricocheting
around
my
mouth
salty
pretzel
flavors
rye
bread
barley
malt
bracing
hops
herbs
and
spices
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
full
and
good
and
the
drinkability
is
downright
sessionable
another
great
beer
from
surly
they
deserve
every
accolade
they
have
received
buy
this
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
dark
orange
color
with
a
quickly
dissolving
head
but
decent
lacing
throughout
i
didnt
get
much
from
the
aroma
in
the
way
of
hops
and
a
mild
malt
smell
taste
was
very
good
nice
and
grainy
without
being
too
sweet
good
balance
of
piney
hops
on
this
one
felt
a
little
weak
in
the
mouth
not
much
texture
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
great
flavor
and
very
sessionable
now
normally
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fest
beer
but
this
the
malts
are
sweet
lovely
hop
hit
bang
ya
really
like
all
other
surly
beer
it
defies
description
and
is
just
simply
fantastic
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
crisp
if
not
a
little
too
lean
perhaps
an
utterly
fantastic
beer
to
drink
this
beer
was
so
easy
to
drink
i
really
feel
like
this
is
the
best
lager
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
like
a
good
pils
i
like
the
high
end
doppelbocks
there
are
some
good
marzens
out
there
but
this
was
hands
down
my
favorite
lager
this
pours
an
opaque
dark
amber
color
whith
a
thick
white
head
and
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
hops
the
taste
has
a
rich
maltiness
typical
of
octoberfests
what
makes
this
different
than
any
octoberfest
i
have
ever
tasted
before
is
the
huge
hop
flavor
both
citrussy
and
pineyi
believe
they
dry
hopped
it
while
it
stretchesand
i
think
exceedsthe
boundaries
of
the
octoberfest
style
one
cannot
deny
that
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
islike
all
surly
beersrich
and
full
bodied
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
just
wish
they
would
call
it
something
other
than
an
octoberfest
im
glad
surly
took
this
one
for
a
spin
the
unassuming
and
standard
looking
body
do
not
harbinger
the
different
but
fantastic
beer
that
is
surlyfest
the
smell
gives
it
away
at
first
mangos
pineapple
strawberry
passionfruit
all
very
malty
but
rich
and
fruity
as
well
the
taste
backs
this
up
a
rich
malty
beer
with
many
fruit
notes
also
carmel
malts
with
a
betterthanaverageforthestyle
hop
finish
i
think
surly
couldve
stuck
with
what
may
be
assumed
is
the
surly
formula
hops
up
the
wazoo
but
this
beer
is
so
much
more
it
is
delicious
unique
and
should
be
tried
by
all
a
standout
oktoberfest
this
might
be
my
favorite
octoberfest
mostly
because
surlys
effort
is
not
to
style
which
is
fine
by
me
starts
with
nice
creamy
tan
head
thin
but
might
have
been
the
bartenders
pour
more
than
the
beer
copper
colored
beer
with
gold
highlights
strong
citrus
aroma
hop
and
malt
strong
very
aromatic
almost
like
a
fresh
hop
not
sure
what
it
is
but
smell
like
american
hops
the
hop
character
is
strong
on
top
of
a
lot
of
caramel
taste
in
the
malt
very
fun
to
drink
and
will
make
a
point
of
getting
another
before
it
runs
out
heres
what
the
label
tells
us
our
take
on
the
classic
festival
beer
has
a
silky
malt
flavor
with
an
initial
sweetness
that
sets
up
the
interplay
of
mild
toffeelike
notes
and
floral
hops
also
this
everyone
loves
a
great
party
and
there
are
few
quite
as
famous
as
germanys
oktoberfest
inspired
by
that
rollicking
celebration
we
bring
you
our
variation
on
that
classic
festival
beer
oktoberfest
is
mediumbodied
and
rich
with
malt
flavor
but
maintains
a
crisp
finish
marked
by
floral
hops
overall
one
of
the
better
sierra
oaks
beers
very
good
a
solid
oktoberfest
not
my
favorite
style
d

oktoberfest
is
an
enjoyable
quaff
rich
and
malty
while
still
crushable
seems
to
have
much
more
depth
of
flavor
than
most
other
fest
beers
slightly
authentic
and
yet
unique
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
is
a
good
marzan
overall
for
a
first
crack
at
an
oktoberfest
by
sierra
nevada
this
one
does
not
disappoint
would
love
to
see
this
in
sixers
pours
out
a
deep
orangeamber
with
a
thin
head
smells
malty
grainy
and
with
a
hint
of
noble
hop
taste
is
huge
on
caramel
bread
honey
brown
sugar
piloncillo
raisin
and
grape
nuts
grassy
and
herbal
noble
hop
comes
out
strong
in
the
finish
a
bit
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
leans
towards
thick
and
is
sticky
the
flavor
profile
on
this
is
solid
but
its
a
tad
too
sweet
overall
what
oktoberfests
can
and
should
be
o
this
is
like
the
brown
ale
of
oktoberfest
marzens
stunning
bold
and
simply
delicious
its
malt
forward
aroma
pops
and
its
luscious
flavor
delivers
a
wonderful
experience
unique
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
oktoberfests
but
its
not
only
about
it
suiting
me
as
the
quality
is
there
as
well
lets
hope
this
is
a
new
bottled
tradition
from
the
great
sierra
nevada
brewing
co
o
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brew
but
not
bad
by
any
means
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
marzen
style
but
enjoy
it
during
the
season
i
would
buy
this
again
no
problem
sierra
nevada
is
one
of
the
best
brewers
around
ive
enjoyed
every
beer
ive
tried
from
them
somewhat
bitter
and
hoppy
clear
with
a
beige
head
taste
is
more
lageresque
as
a
nice
malt
backbone
strikes
with
burnt
caramel
and
toasted
grains
fruitiness
disappears
and
is
replaced
by
a
mild
floral
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
damn
good
oktoberfest
and
sn
would
do
the
us
a
favor
by
releasing
this
in
6
andor
12
packs
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
paulaners
marzen
with
a
bit
more
toast
and
rough
edges
quite
good
the
rest
another
solid
offering
from
sn
a
clean
classic
representative
of
the
style
this
pours
with
a
bubbly
character
and
a
lighter
barley
brown
color
airy
barley
malt
aroma
with
a
tinge
of
nutty
biscuit
taste
has
a
bit
of
chocolate
barley
grain
nutty
pecan
toasted
biscuit
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
nothing
about
this
is
assertive
but
it
does
the
job
of
relaying
good
complex
flavor
in
a
relatively
inexpensive
package
o
its
ok
to
be
blunt
it
taste
like
a
mixture
of
old
english
which
i
like
and
sns
flipside
which
is
amazing

the
way

feels

i

the

day

out
alternates
to

the
familiar
robust

polite
welcoming

what

good
oktoberfest
bier
but
not
my
favorite
poured
a
small
white
head
which
did
not
last
well
overall
the
flavor
was
excellent
with
only
the
lack
of
a

bread

a
littlle
vague

mixed
six
from
trader
joes
in

good
oktoberfest
beer
but
nothing
special
about
it
edit
just
had
it
on
tap
and
its
just
as
bad
as
in
the
bottle
slightly
less
sour
but
still
nasty
this
pours
with
a
thin
carbonated
hue
of
barley
brown
strangely
it
has
a
euroskunk
aroma
with
an
apple
cider
like
scent
the
flavor
is
an
euro
barleylike
taste
it
tastes
like
spaten
lager
but
with
more
graininess
its
very
light
easy
and
quenching
this
is
not
my
go
to
marzen
but
if
im
looking
for
a
beer
to
cap
off
the
night
its
certainly
worthwhile
overall
a
respectable
oktoberfest
and
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
available
in
the
states
pretty
readily
available
and
worth
picking
up

slightly

mediumlight

high

overall
a
very

beer
wouldnt
take
an
effort
to
down
these
in
liters
in
an
octoberfest
tent
not
special
enough
to
buy
to
be
had
at
home
again
though
o
less
caramel
malt
in
the
flavor
than
most
american
oktoberfests
the
metallic
finish
was
a
little
off
putting
really
enjoyable
drink
dare
i
say
i
like
this
just
as
much
as
hofbrau
crisper
and
lighter
bodied
than
other
american
oktoberfests
ive
had
with
a
good
deal
of
head
pleasantly
carbonated
very
refreshing
haters
gonna
hate
but
i
think
its
better
than
most
american
marzens
for
my
money
the
only
american
one
that
rivals
this
that
i
have
tried
is
harpoons
overall
a
wonderful
and
refreshing
marzen
would
happily
drink
again
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
color
there
was
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
decent
aroma
a
bit
of
toasted
malts
possible
some
earthy
hops
also
no
noticeable
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
toasted
malts
and
slight
biscuit
notes
it
has
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
is
very
smooth
nice
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
that
is
neither
cloying
nor
watered
down
a
pretty
safe
pick
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
solid
seasonal
offering
crisp
and
clean
a
little
bit
of
spice
from
the
hops
and
yeast
but
not
too
floral
or
bitter
not
too
heavy
so
i
could
still
enjoy
drinking
this
on
a
warmish
september
day
o
love
this
oktoberfest
offering
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
lack
of
bitterness
very

i
like
a
good
octoberfest
beer
no
nonsense
just
heavy
enough
on
the
hops
but
still
balanced
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
than
one
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
not
much
of
a
head
decent
lacing
light
amber
in
color
hops
with
just
a
bit
of
citrus
on
the
nose
not
real
complicated
hops
on
the
palate
with
an
ever
so
slightly
astringent
finish
almost
too
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
knock
back
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
makes
me
quite
affectionate
for
this
time
of

of
the
road
octofest
nice
marzen
availability
is
good
and
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
authentic
oktoberfest
it
comes
through
good
octoberfest
beer
light
amber
color
and
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
and
smooth
finish
i
love
oktoberfest
beers
and
this
one
is
the
best
of
them
though
its
better
some
years
than
others
i
always
drink
plenty
of
it
might
have
been
a
little
lacking
this
year
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
i
still
love
it
poured
a
light
brown
color
not
a
very
pleasant
smell
skunky
smell
tastes
good
though
one
of
the
better
tasting
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
taste
is
equally
as
crisp
and
malty
even
a
little
sweet
but
still
wellbalanced
i
get
some
toastiness
some
toffee
and
plenty
of
flavor
packed
into
here
overall
as
easytodrink
oktoberfest
that
i
can
see
being
perfect
for
bierstubes
or
oktoberfest
celebrations
always
buy
a
couple
kegs
this
time
of
year
spaten
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
a
pleasant
märzen
although
quite
malty
it
is
not
cloying
showing
that
hops
are
doing
their
work
behind
the
curtains
faithful
to
style
this
beer
once
you
pop
the
cap
reminds
me
of
peroni
beer
it
has
the
same
bready
yeasty
smell
on
the
nose
however
it
is
heavier
and
a
bit
sweeter
not
my
liking
i
made
a
session
out
of
this
brew
trying
to
study
it
from
all
angles
and
since
it
is
a
marzen
meaning
it
is
brewed
between
the
months
of
september
through
april
i
was
reminded
of
how
its
german
heritage
really
gave
it
a
good
quality
taste
but
a
head
that
faints
quickly
after
pour
i
was
astonished
to
see
the
words
malt
liquor
on
the
label
of
this
beer
and
was
thoroughly
disappointed
by
this
description
it
is
definitely
worthier
than
the
malt
liquors
out
there
but
hey
we
cant
all
be
skeptics
all
the
time
would
i
try
this
beer
again
maybe
if
it
was
free
there
are
plenty
of
german
brews
to
be
imbibed
and
therefore
i
will
be
seeking
a
better
session
than
spaten
overall
ok
but
nothing
to
really
implore
you
to
try
again
overall
good
but
not
great
i
am
a
little
disappointed
as
i
normally
love
the
marzen
style
and
i
hoped
that
this
authentic
brew
from
munich
would
be
the
best
i
ever
had
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
caveats
this
was
a
green
bottle
with
no
bottling
date
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
this
beer
fresh
in
germany
and
then
render
another
review
i
just
felt
the
beer
lacked
what
i
normally
enjoy
in
this
style
a
malty
caramel
dominance
instead
the
hops
seemed
to
dominate
pours
a
pretty
darker
amber
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
of
a
offwhite
head
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
light
citrus
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
biscuit
yeast
with
some
spice
very
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
a
very
light
dry
finish
is
noted
overall
really
like
this
one
and
not
a
big
fan
of
oktoberfest
brews
for
the
most
part
but
this
one
is
the
exception
for
sure
a
decent
if
not
remarkable
effort
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
o
overall
its
nothing
special
but
i
was
expecting
that
just
a
decent
beer
no
surprises
o
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
thats
not
saying
much
for
a
style
that
already
means
uncomplicated
o
ok
marzen
a
great
style
from
a
great
brewer
than
probably
arrives
on
these
shores
mid
pack
grabbed
this
one
in
a
mixed
6er
at
whole
foods
tried
this
in
a
small
taster
glass
on
a
night
while
trying
other
beers
as
well
amber
in
color
i
really
like
it
dispite
the
fact
it
was
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
concerning
the
mouthfeel
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
orange
i
was
getting
descent
oktoberfest
beer
it
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
subtle
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
all
caramel
malt
with
slight
roasted
malt
but
definitely
little
to
no
hop
presence
the
faste
was
an
obvious
malt
forward
profile
with
caramel
malt
and
some
nutty
roastiness
as
well
there
was
a
slight
spicy
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
keeps
your
attention
while
ill
admit
there
is
nothing
over
the
top
spectacular
about
this
lager
it
hits
my
taste
buds
in
all
the
right
spots
its
easy
to
drink
with
enough
flavor
to
distinguish
itself
from
a
league
of
lagers
and
keeps
me
looking
forward
to
oktoberfest
every
year
o
a
solid
marzen
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
considering
the
price
point
there
are
better
american
expressions
widely
available
for
a
better
value
im
never
afraid
to
pick
this
up
at
a
bar
if
its
the
only
oktoberfest
option
or
is
i
can
find
a
great
price
at
a
wholesaler
overall
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
marzen
even
though
its
an
americanized
one
overall
excellent
and
substantial
lager
with
complex
and
balanced
maltiness
pretty
good
oktoberfestbier
but
not
for
my
money
the
best
out
there
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
that
has
all
the
right
proportions
a
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
its
flavorful
and
kind
it
is
resilient
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
dry
with
a
light
sweetness
that
is
earthy
like
all
the
good
and
savory
food
to
come
on
the
fall
table
it
has
the
color
of
autumn
fire
it
has
the
presence
of
a
crisp
fall
wind
and
the
wet
scent
of
yeast
and
bread
this
is
home
and
hearth
a
fire
and
the
warm
glow
of
toasts
in
late
august
in
2009
i
had
my
first
sam
adams
octoberfest
since
trying
the
original
i
no
longer
liked
it
as
the
hops
aftertaste
took
over
my
palate
this
was
a
defining
moment
as
it
perfectly
demonstrated
for
me
what
i
like
and
dislike
about
beer
i
always
stock
up
with
6
case
in
my
beer
cellar
for
the
offseason
and
ration
carefully
on
tap
at
one
of
those
cigar
bars
in
old
market
omaha
it
pours
real
flat
looking
although
it
doesnt
feel
that
way
when
you
drink
it
dark
orange
burnt
sugar
color
with
zero
head
a
nose
of
german
amber
malts
almost
like
an
altbier
but
a
little
richer
and
sweeter
good
depth
of
flavor
here
malt
driven
obviously
but
with
some
pine
in
the
finish
and
a
very
very
light
lager
yeast
that
lets
all
the
other
elements
do
the
talking
dense
though
not
well
enough
carbonated
but
brighter
than
it
appears
too
filling
for
more
than
a
few
this
one
seems
off
from
the
rest
the
paulaner
and
the
hacker
and
the
like
a
step
behind
which
is
odd
for
spaten
but
true
for
this
one
i
honestly
didnt
care
for
it
a
whole
lot
disjointed
and
sloppy
even
for
an
original
in
my
humble
opinion
better
in
a
bottle
but
not
by
a
lot
o
ayinger
is
better
id
seek
that
or
even
sam
adams
over
this
one
sorry
o
one
of
the
best
a
true
munich
brewed
oktoberfestbier
an
okay
brew
nothing
special
a
one
and
done
the
body
is
medium
and
the
feel
is
taken
by
a
bright
crispness
before
it
smooths
out
though
it
never
loses
the
nip
was
surprised
by
this
one
green
bottle
scared
me
a
bit
but
this
is
a
goodun
prost
overall
a
nice
drinking
beer
fantastic
lacing
nice
golden
and
clear
tasting
i
love
september
when
oktoberfest
beers
appear
i
try
as
i
many
as
i
can
but
spaten
as
a
true
munich
style
is
one
that
is
always
stocked
in
my
fridge
prosit
this
beer
is
a
true
representation
of
the
classic
marzen
style
once
you
pop
open
the
bottle
youre
immediately
hit
with
a
delicious
malty
nose
when
it
comes
to
taste
im
reminded
of
a
really
good
pilsener
with
a
delicious
multisweetness
to
accompany
it
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
with
notes
of
sweetcorn
as
it
passes
through
the
pallet
all
and
all
a
great
oktoberfest
brew
cheers
overall
id
have
this
again
without
delay
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
thats
incredibly
well
done
and
as
close
to
the
epitome
of
an
oktoberfest
as
possible
a
maltlovers
dream
this
is
devoid
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
letting
the
deep
maltiness
really
shine
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
think
this
is
excellent
the
butter
biscuit
rules
the
day
here
in
both
smell
and
taste
its
a
smooth
drink
very
refreshing
perhaps
its
too
easy
of
a
drinker
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
a
fine
enough
drink
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
light
red
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
dark
grain
with
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
or
candy
smell
tastes
of
dark
grain
with
nice
balance
this
light
bodied
beer
goes
down
great
and
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
in
my
book
it
is
probably
approaching
world
class
and
i
could
see
how
one
can
call
it
that
i
think
it
may
be
a
little
thin
and
therefore
i
am
only
going
to
give
it
like
a
4
3
out
of
5
or
so
not
shabby
at
all
very
good
i
would
seek
this
out
again
as
it
is
sessionable
even
though
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
742012
pours
lightly
cloudy
orange
copper
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
pear
apple
biscuit
toast
floral
light
pepper
and
herbal
earthiness
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
of
malt
and
fruity
notes
taste
of
caramel
pear
apple
biscuit
toast
floral
light
pepper
and

lingering
notes
of
caramel
light
fruits
biscuit
toast
floral
light
pepper
and
herbal
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
fruity
ester
flavors
with
good
complexity
and
robustness
of
all
flavors
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
present
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
style
very
well
balanced
between
malt
and
fruity
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
im
glad
this
beer
is
sold
year
round
o
not
bad
but
not
likely
to
buy
more
o
it
is
a
good
beer
there
are
just
too
many
amazing
oktoberfest
beers
from
germany
where
this
one
just
isnt
worth
picking
up
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
if
given
a
pour
or
on
a
nice
sale
its
pretty
darn
good
not
a
classic
or
one
im
likely
to
have
again
for
that
matter
but
it
was
still
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
enjoyed
despite
it
fading
very
slightly
at
the
tail
end
spaten
is
the
original
oktoberfest
beer
and
i
always
load
up
on
this
beer
come
late
september
as
it
is
only
around
for
about
2
months
o
overall
i
think
its
ok
im
a
bigger
fan
of
some
of
the
american
takes
on
oktoberfest
marzens
thats
just
me
though
so
understand
that
i
have
to
agree
with
alexrichman
in
the
previous
review
except
i
give
it
slighty
higher
marks
marzen
octoberfest
brews
are
among
my
two
favorite
styles
this
one
is
a
must
try
this
really
is
a
superior
octoberfest
marzen
style
beer
if
this
were
avalible
year
round
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
year
round
o
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
the
best
oktoberfest
but
it
blows
away
almost
any
domestic
oktoberfest
beer
you
could
compare
it
to
in
the
end
its
a
delicious
beer
its
complex
enough
for
enthusiasts
yet
gentle
enough
for
people
who
arent
avid
beer
drinkers
how
could
anyone
dislike
this
its
like
fall
in
a
glass
pours
deep
amber
color
with
very
little
head
skunky
aroma
up
front
with
a
touch
of
raisin
surprisingly
clean
taste
notes
of
caramel
malt
with
subtle
earthy
finish
it
is
actually
pretty
refreshing
despite
first
appearance
and
aroma
nice
easy
drinking
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
clean
your
palate
after
each
sip
flavor
stays
consistent
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
thought
the
skunk
from
being
imported
in
a
green
bottle
was
gonna
ruin
it
but
it
holds
up
overall
i
will
choose
other
oktoberfestbiers
over
this
easily
not
sure
if
i
just
got
an
old
bottle
or
if
this
is
the
taste
they
were
going
for
o
the
start
wasnt
great
but
it
finished
strong
and
i
liked
this
better
then
i
thought
i
would
i
had
tried
this
beer
in
the
past
but
not
recently
and
it
will
definitely
be
one
i
will
consider
the
next
time
octoberfall
comes
around
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
the
german
styles
but
this
one
stays
true
to
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
the
best
beer
ever
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
an
average
oktoberfest
offering
not
bad
but
nothing
special
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
and
makes
me
want
to
have
another
it
is
an
average
offering
for
this
time
of
year
o
very
drinkable
an
approachable
beer
start
to
finish
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
overall
a
highly
drinkable
octoberfest
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
smooth
and
refreshing
o
while
this
is
a
solid
german
example
of
the
style
this
doesnt
quite
make
it
as
one
of
my
favorites
since
it
struggles
to
distinguish
itself
from
many
others
that
said
i
still
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
and
a
solid
option
to
have
during
these
cooler
months
of
the
year
rather
nice
and
very
drinkable
not
a
complex
brew
but
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
quaffing
in
large
quantities
while
enjoying
the
atmosphere
at
the
festival
perhaps
the
next
time
i
try
it
ill
actually
be
there
this
is
a
perfectly
sessionable
afternoon
beer
balance
of
crispness
and
malt
not
overly
complex
and
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
easydrinking
o
this
beer
does
the
basics
well
but
isnt
interesting
enough
for
me
to
buy
it
again
and
the
skunk
is
a
turnoff
what
can
i
say
if
you
want
a
german
oktoberfest
try
another
one
i
had
a
spaten
before
and
it
was
great
thinking
german
oktoberfest
i
tryed
this
one
the
only
good
thing
it
goes
down
smooth
but
i
had
one
stinky
bottle
so
so
color
so
so
taste
so
just
move
on
to
another
oktoberfest
beer
o
spaten
has
done
a
great
job
at
creating
an
oktoberfest
that
commands
sip
after
sip
almost
subconsciously
my
pint
disappeared
quickly
and
its
salty
feel
is
the
culprit
its
rather
plain
malty
base
provides
what
an
oktoberfest
drinker
is
looking
for
without
any
frills
for
an
easy
drinker
and
once
again
ill
gloss
over
the
whole
issue
with
green
bottles
saying
only
that
if
this
were
in
brown
glass
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
while
maybe
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
some
imports
out
there
id
still
take
this
over
the
majority
of
the
american
takes
on
the
style
that
many
breweries
are
putting
out
as
its
got
the
two
things
that
count
for
me
balance
and
crispness
id
drink
one
of
these
any
time
o
this
beer
is
better
than
i
expected
and
tasted
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
one
of
those
things
that
you
will
either
like
it
or
not
i
happen
to
enjoy
drinking
malt
liquor
from
time
to
time
so
this
is
a
pretty
nice
treat
for
me
o
i
used
to
love
oktoberfests
as
they
were
one
of
the
first
beer
styles
i
branched
into
but
i
lost
my
love
for
them
however
while
this
beer
is
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
it
does
grow
on
you
as
you
drink
it
overall
not
bad
not
great
either
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
does
manage
to
pair
quite
well
with
your
stereotypical
german
fare
i
love
the
style
but
for
me
this
one
is
just
a
little
out
of
balance
its
really
sweet
but
in
an
odd
way
i
wouldnt
call
it
bittersweet
but
there
is
a
bitterness
to
it
that
catches
you
off
guard
a
little
again
out
of
balance
maybe
on
another
day
id
have
been
game
for
it
golden
colour
medium
thin
head
which
went
fast
but
some
lacing
was
retained
clear
aroma
was
straw
and
hay
with
notes
of
caramel
and
red
cabbage
tasted
caramel
and
red
cabagge
finish
was
wheaty
and
bitter
quite
peppery
seemed
to
switch
between
bitter
and
sweet
but
had
more
bitterness
than
other
oktoberfest
beers
from
munich
well
carbonated
crisp
smooth
enough
easy
to
identify
as
a
munich
oktoberfest
beer
decent
but
not
the
best
o
basically
its
that
classic
dry
munichfestivalbier
taste
in
the
same
vein
as
related
beers
like
hofbrau
these
are
essentially
what
american
macros
are
trying
to
be
by
my
nonexpert
perception
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
varieties
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
willimantic
brewing
in
willimantic
ct
red
and
semicloudy
with
a
very
subtle
taste
to
it
a
bit
lacking
however
it
does
hint
at
a
beautiful
roasted
nut
flavor
with
a
great
strong
bitter
aftertaste
the
flavor
of
this
unfortunately
becomes
a
bit
muddled
as
you
continue
drinking
this
is
a
good
beer
but
spaten
makes
better
and
while
i
would
still
recommend
this
its
not
the
best
spaten
ive
ever
had
overall
it
was
easy
drinking
and
had
some
pretty
nice
flavors
but
nothing
too
exceptional
c
not
the
best
offering
of
oktoberfest
i
have
every
had
not
the
greatest
offering
i
had
from
spaten
either
but
in
the
end
not
a
bad
choice
could
not
tell
the
expiration
date
on
the
bottle
but
it
tastes
as
if
its
past
its
prime
which
is
odd
because
its
oktoberfest
season
if
i
were
longing
for
a
spaten
i
think
i
will
stick
to
an
optimator
there
was
a
number
stamped
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
but
not
a
clear
date
probably
have
to
cross
reference
the
number
to
get
a
true
bottling
or
batch
date
i
will
say
that
my
6pack
tasted
a
bit
past
its
prime
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
from
spaten
before
for
its
travels
and
most
likely
its
preparation
for
the
trip
the
us
it
ends
up
being
a
pretty
good
lager
in
the
world
of
beer
and
oktoberfest
it
is
a
pretty
easy
assumption
that
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
better
from
the
source
but
with
that
said
the
beer
that
is
sent
over
is
certain
worth
getting
o
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
however
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
on
tap
seems
to
be
tainted
and
weak
one
oktoberfest
that
will
not
be
revisited
unless
its
on
tap
and
a
tavern
special
overall
a
very
solid
brew
the
hops
balance
the
sweetness
well
but
as
a
marzen
should
be
its
definitely
malt
dominant
o
overall
this
is
another
disappointing
beer
from
spaten
how
this
got
labled
an
oktoberfest
completely
blows
my
mind
but
it
isnt
a
terrible
beer
my
any
means
want
a
real
oktoberfest
try
the
one
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
oprobably
the
second
best
märzen
ive
had
and
may
be
my
go
to
down
the
road
i
purchased
this
only
because
i
had
a
credit
at
a
local
liquor
store
that
had
sold
me
some
outdated
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
chose
this
one
i
dont
know
what
this
brewer
is
trying
to
pull
by
calling
this
an
oktoberfest
but
i
sure
as
hell
wont
be
fooled
again
i
never
thought
id
say
this
but
ive
tasted
american
oktoberfests
like
great
lakes
offering
that
demolish
this
german
oktoberfest
this
is
a
travesty
of
a
beer
and
is
not
worthy
of
a
german
label
the
brewers
who
made
this
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
avoid
paired
this
with
the
gasthaus
platter
which
is
some
of
the
finest
german
cuisine
youll
find
in
wisconsin
o
this
is
a
pass
in
my
book
one
of
the
most
boring
and
simple
oktoberfest
i
have
had
definitely
get
sam
adams
over
this
one
i
used
to
drink
so
many
different
beers
from
germany
and
loved
so
many
of
them
spaten
was
always
on
the
top
of
my
list
but
i
guess
over
the
years
as
i
started
tasted
so
many
of
the
crafted
beers
throughout
usa
my
tastes
are
heading
that
way
so
an
oktoberfest
not
just
this
one
by
spaten
but
others
including
domestic
just
arent
suited
for
me
i
recommend
spaten
oktoberfestbier
urmarzen
to
anyone
who
loves
a
satisfying
decadent
beer
but
isnt
looking
for
something
thats
just
good
on
its
own
this
is
beer
to
be
had
with
a
feast
and
with
friends
loud
boisterous
laughter
and
hijinks
will
make
this
beer
all
the
better
it
tastes
like
a
special
occasion
so
have
a
festival
in
your
mouth
with
oktoberfestbier
and
you
can
bet
itll
be
a
time
with
good
friends
youll
talk
about
for
the
rest
of
your
life
im
guessing
a
draft
of
spaten
in
munich
might
taste
a
little
better
than
a
beer
shipped
in
a
green
bottle
over
the
atlantic
ocean
pretty
solid
o
nothing
mind
blowing
but
high
quality
like
many
german
brews
ive
had
o
honestly
while
its
damn
solid
at
its
job
id
say
look
elsewhere
for
a
marzen
simply
because
theres
too
much
of
a
chance
youll
get
skunked
bottles
if
you
can
get
it
in
a
manner
that
doesnt
allow
this
to
happen
read
on
tap
then
by
all
means
go
for
it
o
an
average
oktoberfest
interpretation
from
the
bottle
if
only
i
could
have
this
ontap
unpasteurized
undisturbed
in
munich
overall
oxidized
with
cardboard
aromas
when
first
opened
but
complex
malt
aromas
in
flavor
and
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
the
finish
is
sweet
but
would
have
appreciated
more
munich
mallt
poured
clear
amber
brown
color
with
a
big
foam
head
smell
has
some
caramel
and
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
green
bottle
skunk
taste
and
feel
is
thin
watery
some
toasted
and
sweet
malt
flavors
overall
its
an
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
beer
not
much
depth
for
a
sipper
but
made
to
drink
by
the
64oz
mug
because
this
lager
is
an
import
i
cannot
evaluate
a
fresh
batch
but
overall
this
lager
is
true
to
the
style
snappy
hops
upfront
earthy
and
spicy
with
generous
toastiness
malts
are
rigidly
bitter
and
grainy
quenching
feel
sudsy
with
a
bristly
finish
that
carries
through
some
backend
heat
body
is
smooth
enough
11
2
ounces
is
a
small
sample
for
what
id
like
to
have
in
front
of
me
toss
me
two
more
bottles
and
a
stein
copper
sort
of
malty
and
bready
but
not
with
the
body
id
expect
from
the
style
serving
type
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
almost
blackamber
with
a
12
inch
of
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
quite
estery
and
sweet
and
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
big
malt
backbone
and
almost
no
bite
from
the
alcohol
its
very
smooth
drinking
and
finishes
dry
this
beer
is
undoubtably
german
and
hits
the
spot
even
though
im
drinking
it
in
the
middle
of
summer
i
would
have
preferred
a
rich
beer
like
this
last
fall
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
soapy
biege
head
that
dissipate
sslowly
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
there
are
smells
of
roasted
malts
its
a
pretty
clean
smell
the
taste
is
bready
with
some
sweetness
it
has
a
cracker
like
flavor
there
isnt
much
flavor
from
the
hops
but
they
are
there
on
the
back
end
theres
a
mild
astringent
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
and
there
isnt
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
but
like
many
german
beers
im
sure
i
would
have
a
better
opinion
of
it
if
i
drank
it
in
germany
pours
a
dull
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
antique
white
head
the
head
retains
well
light
caramel
malt
aroma
excellently
balanced
mouthfeel
butterscotch
and
caramel
balanced
with
the
faintest
grassy
hop
just
a
lovely
oktoberfest
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
place
who
shelves
it
365
days
a
year
o
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
i
remember
going
to
germany
a
few
years
ago
before
i
was
really
into
beer
and
thinking
nothing
could
beat
a
proper
german
brew
since
being
back
in
the
states
i
cant
find
anything
that
comes
close
cant
wait
to
get
back
to
europe
to
try
some
local
german
beers
or
even
just
to
find
some
good
imports
in
the
states
i
am
somewhat
partial
to
german
products
but
against
others
i
do
like
this
oktoberfest
i
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
spaten
oktoberfest
at
trader
joes
and
must
say
this
beer
let
me
down
overall
an
average
and
forgettable
brew
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
except
the
sticker
shock
of
paying
twice
as
much
for
what
is
essentially
deutcsh
yuengling
o
its
not
very
bold
its
mediocre
for
its
style
o
we
owe
spaten
oktoberfest
an
apology
for
expecting
any
form
of
disappointment
this
nostalgic
beer
is
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
ever
drank
will
definitely
get
this
more
in
the
future
overall
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
overall
nothing
great
but
you
could
do
much
worse
o
a
really
delicious
medium
bodied
oktoberfest
not
overly
comlex
and
easy
to
drink
without
feeling
cheap
perfect
for
the
fall
season
this
beer
goes
down
quickly
but
thats
mostly
because
its
just
not
tasty
enough
to
leave
it
lingering
around
in
you
mouth
for
a
more
in
depth
taste
o
a
very
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
very
malty
with
minimal
amounts
of
hops
no
complaints
here
o
a
good
oktoberfest
however
i
cant
help
but
think
that
its
much
better
fresh
rather
than
after
shipped
overseas
but
it
is
what
it
is
o
i
would
rate
this
3
75
but
expect
my
overall
rating
to
be
higher
than
i
would
assign
a
good
but
not
great
beer
and
i
liked
this
better
than
samuel
adams
octoberfest
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nce
amber
color
body
with
a
nice
1finger
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
grains
with
some
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
has
some
sweetness
to
it
i
dont
get
any
hops
notes
at
all
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
ok
marzen
taste
isnt
all
that
impressive
for
an
oktoberfest
the
nice
caramel
smoothness
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
marzen
is
subdued
an
ale
crispness
comes
from
no
where
takes
over
and
dominates
until
about
halfway
through
the
beer
after
a
while
it
becomes
caramely
smooth
from
then
on
out
one
of
the
darker
versions
of
the
style
with
a
light
brown
hue
and
a
white
head
bits
of
lace
smell
is
quite
malty
with
lots
of
buttery
toasted
grains
and
yeasty
bread
a
bit
of
skunk
as
well
taste
is
malty
with
a
dry
graininess
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
a
light
fruitiness
that
flows
into
a
herbal
hop
bitterness
clean
dry
finish
with
not
much
lingering
but
some
toast
feel
is
medium
light
weight
but
a
touch
thin
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
light
crisp
overall
sensation
a
decent
take
on
the
style
and
certainly
enjoyable
but
unremarkable
overall
ive
heard
the
reason
for
the
difference
in
the
2
beers
is
that
the
bottle
versions
are
pasturized
thus
zapping
alot
of
flavor
i
seem
to
believe
that
because
these
2
beers
do
not
taste
the
same
overall
drinkable
but
not
very
good
creamy
and
robust
the
feel
is
excellent
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
it
adds
just
enough
crispness
while
retaining
its
extraordinary
smoothness
its
amazing
how
easy
to
drink
these
are
in
large
quantities
especially
at
an
oktoberfest
when
my
belly
is
full
of
brats
and
kraut
they
just
have
the
ability
to
methodically
go
down
like
bottles
of
beer
on
the
wall
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
where
this
ones
at
very
very
balanced
crisp
and
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
like
too
many
us
takes
on
the
style
not
overly
hopped
which
can
ruin
this
style
also
just
good
healthy
amounts
of
malt
noble
hop
at
super
crisp
lager
levels
very
sessionable
and
appropriate
alongside
any
german
fare
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
its
purpose
drinking
in
the
back
yard
for
the
last
days
of
our
colorado
indian
summer
days
this
is
a
beer
that
well
go
down
easy
with
just
enough
body
and
character
to
make
it
a
drinking
buddy
both
during
the
hot
day
and
in
the
cool
evenings
i
find
it
hard
to
dislike
any
oktoberfest
beer
except
haufbrau
since
the
accompanying
season
is
so
spectacular
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
at
any
other
time
though
a
pleasant
if
slightly
bland
version
of
the
style
while
my
example
is
maybe
not
the
freshest
and
the
green
glass
bottle
probably
doesnt
help
things
either
this
is
still
very
drinkable
o
while
it
may
not
be
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
more
recent
versions
of
octoberfests
ive
had
this
is
still
the
orginal
and
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
mouthfeel
and
overall
lightbodied
a
bit
flat
with
a
grainy
funk
to
it
a
decent
oktoberfest
o
i
love
marzens
and
im
usually
critical
of
them
if
they
dont
pass
this
is
a
great
marzen
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
oktoberfest
with
sweet
and
citrus
notes
i
wish
the
nose
had
something
to
give
me
but
the
flavors
are
really
fun
and
almost
make
up
for
the
lack
of
a
smell
overall
not
a
bad
octoberfest
one
bit
i
think
i
would
get
it
again
this
year
much
better
than
sams
thats
for
sure
i
like
it
food
match
german
food
yeah
thats
been
established
before
what
else
german
beer
is
pretty
versatile
in
my
opinion
how
about
a
classic
porterhouse
steak
medium
rare
with
a
side
of
celeriac
mash
and
carrots
braised
au
jus
is
this
beer
good
enough
for
a
decent
meal
aka
is
it
up
to
the
challenge
well
only
you
can
answer
that
question
o
pretty
basic
but
very
good
imo
oktoberfest
this
ones
better
the
fresher
you
get
it
it
starts
losing
some
of
the
richer
flavors
the
longer
it
sits
on
the
shelf
the
sweet
and
dirty
taste
gets
old
fast
sweat
and
incense
i
think
this
is
the
least
pleasant
oktoberfest
ive
had
overall
its
an
alright
beer
not
my
first
choice
when
im
lookin
for
a
good
octoberfest
beer
but
its
not
at
all
bad
onot
my
favorite
marzen
but
respectablewould
love
to
get
some
before
the
skunk
sneaks
in
the
bottle
im
sure
this
on
tap
would
be
a
much
better
experience
maybe
some
people
actually
like
skunky
beer
heineken
anyone
pours
a
bright
amber
color
from
the
tap
with
a
big
3
finger
head
from
the
over
carbonated
keg
smells
of
pure
malts
and
grains
really
nothing
else
going
on
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
plums
but
also
a
huge
malted
presence
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
o
this
is
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
and
i
would
never
turn
it
down
there
are
other
beers
i
would
choose
including
other
oktoberfests
if
i
had
some
options
aroma
is
of
hay
and
hints
of
caramel
medium
smooth
body
brady
malt
caramel
and
nice
amount
of
herbal
hops
fill
the
mouth
long
balanced
finish
this
brew
will
be
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
o
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
pretty
disappointing
on
this
one
i
liked
the
dundee
better
the
spaten
oktoberfest
is
pretty
good
the
beer
pours
copper
color
with
an
inch
of
white
foam
some
lacing
is
noted
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
an
acidic
smell
with
a
malty
scent
i
found
it
kind
of
bland
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
unfortunately
that
touch
of
astringent
bite
makes
this
just
an
odd
beer
there
is
a
noted
malt
flavor
and
some
sweetness
the
beer
is
drinkability
is
decent
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
surprised
this
was
such
an
underwhelming
marzen
price
is
reasonable
but
there
are
much
better
options
for
this
type
o
i
am
going
to
have
to
do
a
2nd
review
for
this
beer
next
time
i
have
it
on
tap
it
is
a
completely
different
experience
and
this
was
a
disappointing
bottle
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
i
thought
this
was
pretty
darn
good
very
drinkable
and
almost
gulpable
i
drank
a
liter
mug
full
at
a
nearby
biergarten
and
wasnt
over
it
by
the
time
i
was
done
maybe
not
my
top
choice
for
an
oktoberfest
but
id
def
buydrink
again
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grain
and
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
skunked
notes
mixed
in
i
assume
this
is
because
they
decided
to
put
the
beer
in
a
green
bottle
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
nuttyness
but
luckily
there
is
not
any
of
the
skunk
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
green
bottle
should
have
been
a
red
light
on
this
one
a
pretty
disappointing
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
do
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
märzen
but
id
rather
have
a
paulaner
or
hacker
instead
worth
a
try
cheers
12
99
for
a
twelve
pack
in
atlanta
ga
i
dont
know
why
theres
not
a
lot
of
love
for
lagers
on
here
and
for
beers
like
this
this
was
quietly
enjoyable
and
begged
to
be
paired
with
bratwurst
and
lederhosen
the
darker
hue
and
fuller
body
of
this
beer
separate
it
from
other
marzens
that
ive
had
and
for
someone
like
me
who
cant
get
to
munich
this
easily
sufficed
creamy
and
robust
the
feel
is
excellent
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
it
adds
just
enough
crispness
while
retaining
its
extraordinary
smoothness
its
amazing
how
easy
to
drink
these
are
in
large
quantities
especially
at
an
oktoberfest
when
my
belly
is
full
of
brats
and
kraut
they
just
have
the
ability
to
methodically
go
down
like
bottles
of
beer
on
the
wall
overall
a
very
commercial
and
rather
uninteresting
oktoberfest
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
i
complained
to
my
roommate
the
entire
time
i
drank
it
he
told
me
to
stop
drinking
it
but
i
wanted
to
give
this
its
full
chance
it
obviously
failed
when
it
had
its
chance
though
maybe
this
beer
was
skunked
but
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
either
way
i
had
way
too
many
and
they
were
all
amazing
you
dont
need
a
review
of
this
beer
if
you
will
be
drinking
it
at
the
oktoberfest
because
you
will
be
at
oktoberfest
not
sure
if
they
bottle
this
stuff
for
sale
over
here
prob
not
but
i
would
buy
it
just
for
the
nostalgia
its
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
is
an
amazing
experience
prost
a
drinkable
german
oktoberfest
and
about
a
dollar
or
two
cheaper
than
other
competing
sixers
certainly
not
my
first
choice
but
not
my
last
either
a
nice
enough
lager
but
it
fails
to
tick
all
the
notes
expected
of
an
oktoberfest
rather
than
simply
being
a
strong
helles
o
a
highly
drinkable
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
pretty
good
flavor
and
aroma
light
to
medium
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
this
is
a
very
cleanlymade
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
this
is
not
all
that
interesting
or
complex
it
is
not
made
for
sipping
and
contemplating
however
i
can
understand
why
somebody
would
drink
large
quantities
at
a
beer
festival
o
easy
drinking
autumn
beer
for
when
the
football
is
on
and
the
weather
gets
colder
not
something
id
shun
but
not
something
that
would
be
my
first
or
second
or
third
choice
if
i
am
buying
jokes
aside
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
significantly
better
as
you
go
along
no
i
dont
think
thats
true
for
every
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
wisp
of
bubbles
over
the
top
lacing
is
sticky
but
minimal
it
dissipates
as
well
color
is
a
deep
mahoganyamber
taste
well
it
seems
like
last
years
batch
was
awesome
not
this
year
it
is
from
a
green
bottle
and
i
picked
up
a
bit
of
that
skunky
taste
with
this
years
offering
there
are
slightly
sweet
caramel
overtones
mixed
with
some
rich
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
carbonated
im
disappointed
with
this
years
offering
but
its
still
a
good
sessionable
oktoberfest
id
seek
out
a
better
one
for
a
crisp
autumn
weekend
though
from
a
german
brewer
this
is
disappointing
smells
like
a
euro
pale
lager
and
the
taste
is
one
dimensional
its
drinkable
though
and
you
could
put
down
several
of
these
without
knowing
it
poured
into
a
glass
widemouthed
masonstyle
jar
tight
creamy
head
tops
a
deep
ambercaramelcolored
beverage
mild
maltycaramel
aroma
wellbalanced
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
finish
caramel
malt
flavors
to
this
without
it
being
a
maltbomb
light
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
oktoberfest
nothing
outstanding
but
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
o
surprised
this
was
such
an
underwhelming
marzen
price
is
reasonable
but
there
are
much
better
options
for
this
type
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
foamy
slightly
off
white
head
the
smell
is
pretty
light
but
of
toffee
toasted
grain
and
bread
the
feel
is
light
to
medium
the
taste
is
okay
i
get
a
little
toffee
some
caramel
with
some
other
malts
in
the
back
ground
overall
a
little
light
though
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
ive
had
better
overall
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
is
very
true
to
style
it
looks
great
feels
great
but
the
flavor
is
difficult
to
get
into
because
of
the
dull
sourness
and
if
you
have
a
beer
that
does
everything
except
taste
great
do
you
really
have
a
beer
at
all
o
disappointed
with
this
one
i
love
the
spaten
brewery
but
this
beer
just
isnt
very
good
overall
a
very
solid
marzen
very
bready
and
fairly
sweet
medium
body
alright
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
pretty
decent
marzen
although
most
of
the
flavor
is
pretty
nondescript
and
unexciting
at
the
best
o
not
my
favorite
ofest
but
definitely
a
tasty
brew
worth
trying
o
not
a
bad
beer
my
first
marzen
and
while
i
wont
be
running
to
the
beer
store
for
6packs
of
this
style
i
can
see
why
people
dig
this
overall
drinkable
but
forgettable
spatens
other
offerings
are
more
impressive
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
some
oktoberfests
that
are
much
nicer
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
harpoon
krug
looks
great
in
the
mug
pours
a
beautiful
translucent
amber
with
a
rocky
2
5
inch
creamcolored
head
that
eventually
dissipates
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
nose
expresses
classic
german
sourmash
lager
aromas
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
taste
follows
nose
however
there
is
also
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
trace
of
dark
fruit
intermingled
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
bright
carbonation
and
a
slight
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
all
and
all
a
pretty
drinkable
marzen
not
my
favorite
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
at
all
cloying
like
some
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
overall
nothing
offensive
save
the
green
bottle
and
slight
skunkiness
but
ive
had
american
pseudocraft
offerings
for
34
dollars
less
a
sixer
with
more
flavor
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
big
mugs
or
boots
but
theres
nothing
here
that
would
inspire
me
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
brew
yet
another
ofest
finally
getting
sampled
this
year
took
me
long
enough
it
pours
a
clear
light
auburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
rye
bread
light
orange
peel
light
cashew
and
a
touch
of
toasted
wheat
the
taste
is
a
cleaner
version
of
the
smell
complete
with
sweeter
caramel
slightly
spicier
rye
and
richer
orange
its
not
a
leap
really
but
definitely
a
step
up
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
very
solid
ofest
one
of
the
better
ones
out
of
germany
herself
onot
too
bad
i
think
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
o
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
its
great
for
drinking
in
quantity
at
a
beer
fest
like
oktoberfest
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
but
i
will
gladly
swill
it
as
long
as
theyre
the
sponsor
of
this
event
every
year
o
a
little
dark
for
an
oktoberfest
and
id
rather
have
bready
malt
flavors
in
it
than
all
the
caramel
easy
drinking
like
it
should
be
but
there
are
certainly
better
ones
around
i
should
just
stick
to
domestic
beers
as
i
tend
to
prefer
the
flavor
profiles
this
one
just
doesnt
strike
a
happy
note
with
me
bought
from
trader
joes
as
a
single
this
is
pure
fall
in
a
glass
with
its
dark
goldbrown
colour
combined
with
a
nice
fresh
hop
profile
tempered
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
classic
example
of
the
style
and
so
great
with
the
richer
flavours
of
fall
foods
i
should
have
bought
more
copper
orange
with
a
thin
head
of
large
bubbles
mild
breadiness
light
caramel
and
an
odd
grape
juice
character
seem
to
be
the
primary
flavors
grassy
hops
are
a
bit
rough
before
a
husky
astringency
at
the
end
this
is
in
the
bottom
quarter
of
both
the
german
and
american
brewed
oktoberfests
that
flood
the
shelves
this
time
of
year
the
green
bottle
doesnt
help
things
either
from
what
i
know
of
marzen
styles
this
is
fairly
true
to
the
standards
and
doesnt
show
many
obvious
flaws
if
some
find
it
too
plain
they
are
simply
stating
the
obvious
and
decrying
the
beers
intended
focus
on
a
specific
style
and
method
of
brewing
all
the
right
notes
but
a
bit
underwhelming
toned
down
all
around
especially
malt
sweetness
lacks
a
good
pils
snap
but
still
dangerously
easy
o
very
drinkable
fresh
beer
enjoyed
it
prost
overall
one
of
my
favorites
the
fresher
the
better
as
always
on
tap
in
half
liter
mugs
at
a
german
restaurant
that
i
tried
for
the
first
time
today
deep
golden
amber
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
survived
for
most
of
the
night
smells
of
malt
in
spades
bready
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
mixed
with
just
enough
earthy
floral
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
sweet
tastes
is
rich
and
malty
melanoids
mixed
with
bread
and
grain
with
a
spicy
floral
hop
bite
that
keeps
everything
in
check
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
rich
sweet
malt
y
mouthfeel
light
and
easy
to
drink
these
went
down
quite
quickly
and
paired
well
with
my
meal
i
have
to
admit
though
im
a
hugh
brau
fan
spatan
isnt
my
favorite
brand
it
has
very
good
availabilty
in
my
area
so
i
find
myself
drinking
it
fairly
often
also
ive
had
their
oktoberfest
at
least
the
last
12
years
in
a
row
all
thigs
considered
i
feel
its
a
better
beer
than
most
of
the
reviews
indicate
especially
for
people
new
to
bas
focus
on
beer
i
cant
say
i
get
psyced
up
to
fnd
it
but
i
due
look
forward
to
seeing
it
on
the
shelf
every
sept
think
this
one
is
worth
trying
again
especially
if
one
enjoys
the
style
or
is
new
to
it
at
least
you
can
find
it
notes
from
yesterday
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
which
is
kind
of
the
point
of
an
oktoberfest
bier
still
i
cant
see
going
out
of
my
way
for
more
of
these
o
a
decent
oktoberfest
not
sure
if
moving
away
from
green
glass
would
improve
this
or
not
with
the
vast
selection
available
in
this
style
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
d
drinkability
is
nice
on
this
one
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
beer
is
okay
better
than
some
oktoberfest
bier
but
not
as
good
as
some
very
middleoftheroad
for
me
dnot
very
desirable
characteristics
in
this
one
not
enough
malt
notes
and
the
watery
feel
make
this
one
i
probably
wont
revisit
pours
a
copper
color
wth
a
two
finger
head
that
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
very
malty
in
the
aroma
and
taste
with
very
little
hop
presence
as
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
and
decently
carbonated
not
a
bad
marzen
overall
very
drinkable
and
relaxing
on
a
cool
fall
day
o
again
an
overall
well
balanced
octoberfestbier
this
is
one
you
could
drink
out
of
giant
german
beer
steins
and
not
be
overwhelmed
by
hops
flavors
a
great
mass
quanities
party
beer
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
present
throughout
this
brew
with
an
expected
level
from
the
nearly
6
abv
it
is
a
fairly
decent
take
on
the
style
that
is
easy
drinking
worth
giving
a
try
for
sure
when
it
is
in
season
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
rocky
looking
white
head
that
stayed
pretty
consistent
smells
strangely
of
peaches
and
okra
its
a
bit
metallic
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
apricot
it
tastes
sweet
with
nutty
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
beer
is
light
but
not
too
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
dry
finish
this
beer
is
ok
at
best
i
would
drink
it
again
but
theres
other
marzens
that
i
would
choose
first
a
bit
disappointing
coming
from
one
of
the
beer
capitals
of
the
world
the
green
bottle
should
have
warned
me
overall
decent
oktoberfest
but
still
searching
for
one
that
i
think
is
good
wow
what
a
disappointment
aroma
is
lacking
a
bit
some
sweet
and
bready
malts
is
about
the
extent
of
it
taste
is
an
improvement
on
the
smell
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
blend
well
on
the
tongue
perhaps
even
some
dark
fruits
in
the
finish
tasty
and
not
a
hint
of
skunkiness
yah
medium
bodied
and
adequate
carbonation
smooth
a
tasty
offering
o
its
solid
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
at
5
99
for
six
im
sure
ill
have
a
few
this
fall
overall
i
have
to
agree
with
the
whole
skunked
and
green
bottle
situation
since
i
am
a
man
who
likes
sweet
flavors
in
beer
i
find
this
one
lacking
glad
i
only
got
one
for
the
tick
overall
a
very
nice
well
rounded
brew
not
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
tried
but
far
better
than
many
others
i
have
had
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
ordering
i
do
not
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
again
though
i
see
on
the
display
picture
that
the
bottle
they
had
was
a
brown
one
so
i
haave
no
idea
why
this
is
in
a
green
bottle
its
absolutely
ruined
by
the
skunked
flavor
i
get
that
the
skunkiness
can
be
somewhat
appealing
to
some
people
but
thats
for
a
pilsner
or
a
euro
pale
lager
i
go
by
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
however
and
i
have
a
green
bottle
oktoberfest
which
is
going
to
receive
a
big
fat
fail
for
a
bullshit
bier
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
biscuit
and
light
fruits
like
grapes
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
toast
and
grapelike
fruitiness
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
from
spaten
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
in
mass
quantities
from
a
glass
boot
o
good
marzen
overall
but
not
as
sweet
and
chewy
as
other
marzies
and
the
oktoberfest
being
the
biggest
feast
in
the
world
i
guess
one
has
to
go
slow
with
this
o
tasty
with
an
appropriate
mouthfeel
but
not
the
greatest
offering
of
the
style
although
it
has
some
roasted
maltiness
the
skunkiness
of
the
green
glass
can
cover
it
a
bit
ill
be
looking
for
a
draught
version
soon
to
revisit
notes
this
is
my
first
import
maerzen
a
very
drinkable
lager
with
a
rich
slightly
seductive
taste
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
really
love
spatens
helles
lager
so
i
suppose
i
am
predisposed
to
like
this
but
this
is
nice
malty
brew
perfect
for
the
fall
ill
probably
buy
a
case
o
definitely
enjoyable
and
smooth
going
definitely
a
standby
beer
not
one
you
only
want
to
have
one
of
and
then
call
it
a
night
a
clear
brown
slightly
red
big
fluff
of
head
at
first
but
it
vanishes
quickly
to
nothing
aroma
is
bready
caramel
malts
and
earthy
hop
overtones
flavor
is
similar
crisp
and
light
lager
mild
toasty
bread
and
a
earthy
smooth
bitterness
finish
is
more
malty
than
bitter
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
drank
a
six
of
this
while
brewing
some
oktoberfest
the
other
night
satisfying
but
there
are
other
fests
out
there
to
be
drinking
for
the
same
price
o
the
lack
of
pilsner
malt
saves
this
one
from
being
compared
to
a
pilsner
for
the
price
id
rather
a
yuengling
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
far
from
being
a
special
seasonal
offering
bottle
pours
a
translucent
amber
copper
color
with
very
small
receding
head
that
leaves
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
of
roasted
malts
caramel
honey
nuts
and
alcohol
at
5
9
it
is
slightly
more
prominent
in
the
nose
the
beers
flavor
follows
that
of
its
aroma
the
toasted
malts
and
caramel
really
shine
up
front
followed
by
the
sweet
honey
flavor
some
hops
and
just
a
tinge
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
rather
watery
but
it
helps
to
make
the
beer
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
alcohol
and
hops
are
actually
masked
quite
well
in
this
brew
which
leaves
a
sweet
roasted
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
a
good
example
of
a
german
oktoberfest
overall
there
are
other
october
fests
out
there
that
have
more
flavor
this
isnt
bad
but
i
think
ill
buy
the
sam
adams
version
over
this
ill
cheers
this
beer
to
the
fest
of
beers
that
involves
drinking
beer
during
the
beerfest
that
is
oktoberfest
the
fest
of
beers
rjt
then
came
back
and
tasted
bam
germans
now
how
to
make
beer
great
malt
flavor
with
perfect
hop
balance
achieving
clean
malt
flavor
like
this
is
something
few
brewers
try
beer
does
not
get
much
better
than
this
example
freshness
is
very
important
and
this
one
impressed
me
i
want
to
drink
it
in
a
full
liter
mug
brown
beer
in
my
dimpled
stein
nice
solid
brown
hue
clear
and
lively
in
the
glass
not
much
head
thin
and
wispy
and
doesnt
last
really
nice
color
especially
in
the
right
glass
smell
is
surprisingly
clean
and
dominated
by
grassy
hops
slightly
toasty
malt
aroma
in
the
background
a
very
mild
breadiness
boring
aroma
and
not
what
i
expected
from
an
german
brewed
oktoberfestbier
taste
is
a
little
better
more
distinct
malt
taste
but
still
overly
hopped
with
grassyhay
tastes
malts
taste
slightly
adjunct
are
are
thin
and
static
fairly
boring
tastes
still
is
pretty
balanced
and
not
terrible
to
drink
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
with
a
variablesized
white
head
depending
on
the
pour
a
pretty
basic
brew
all
around
with
scents
of
lightly
toasted
malts
and
floral
hops
not
as
pronounced
as
you
would
acquire
in
more
prime
examples
of
the
style
but
still
decent
light
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
white
and
brown
sugar
and
notes
of
apple
and
maybe
a
tad
of
grape
skin
light
mouthfeel
thin
and
easily
drinkable
even
if
its
overall
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
this
beer
pours
out
similar
to
most
other
beers
of
this
style
its
got
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
decent
looking
head
that
fizzles
away
rather
quickly
there
isnt
too
much
in
way
of
lacing
besides
the
suds
that
run
down
the
glass
after
each
sip
the
smell
of
beer
has
a
good
aroma
of
autumn
there
are
some
spices
and
dry
leaves
on
the
nose
mixed
with
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
spiced
but
noting
too
much
there
are
some
flavors
of
caramel
malts
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
i
think
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
o
just
okay
much
better
examples
of
a
marzen
out
there
i
have
had
on
tap
before
and
remember
it
being
better
maybye
an
old
bottle
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
also
wouldnt
turn
away
a
free
one
o
not
so
good
those
offtype
flavors
detracted
from
this
one
made
me
wonder
if
perhaps
it
wasnt
fresh
brought
in
a
chilled
but
not
frosted
mug
head
of
one
finger
was
very
tight
foam
leaving
a
broken
but
very
clingy
lace
color
was
a
9
on
my
pocket
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
like
cottage
cheese
but
there
are
odors
of
roasted
wheat
and
barley
malt
with
a
hint
of
raisins
and
corn
taste
is
a
little
heavy
with
flavors
of
wheat
raisins
orange
peel
pine
nuts
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lots
of
tingle
but
there
is
a
off
aftertaste
of
grapefruit
peel
that
is
just
not
pleasing
this
was
my
first
and
last
unless
someone
gives
me
one
o
its
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
its
not
bad
and
its
readily
available
so
not
a
terrible
choice
d
were
it
not
for
the
skunking
i
could
probably
have
several
of
these
but
if
they
are
all
like
this
one
no
thanks
pours
a
brilliant
yellowtinted
light
caramel
while
the
smell
is
a
malty
mix
of
honeycomb
and
toffee
the
palate
is
lightbodied
with
malty

flavors
leading
to
a
clean
crisp
balancing
hop
cleanse
with
hints
of
coffee
finish
is
short
but
crisp
drinkabilty
is
nice
but
theres
nothing
special
jumping
out
of
the
glass
at
me
i
can
find
a
lot
of
other
better
beers
to
drink
im
thinkin
this
bottle
is
quite
a
bit
old
but
im
gonna
review
it
anyway
pours
an
almostclear
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
doesnt
have
too
much
going
on
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
dark
mexican
lager
i
do
detect
some
caramel
malt
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
a
lot
better
than
the
nose
would
lead
some
grainy
notes
with
caramel
malt
and
other
malt
profiles
i
also
get
some
bread
characteristics
with
a
bit
of
skunk
which
can
be
expected
from
such
an
old
bottle
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
either
drinkability
is
high
as
this
could
be
very
sessionable
on
a
hot
day
all
in
all
im
not
a
fan
of
oktoberfest
beers
and
this
one
hasnt
necessarily
changed
my
mind
d
drinkable
oh
yeah
smooth
satisfying
refreshing
and
delicious
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
brew
ill
also
be
doing
my
best
to
imitate
it
with
my
next
batch
good
stuff
brown
amber
color
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
oaky
tobacco
scent
woody
somewhat
bitter
spicy
flavor
some
more
carbonation
would
really
round
out
this
beers
mouthfeel
but
its
great
as
is
great
drinkability
especially
in
a
pilsner
glass
with
some
bratwurst
and
saurkraut
has
just
enough
spice
and
kick
to
remind
you
that
you
are
in
fact
drinking
beer
while
enjoying
a
traditional
bavarian
oktoberfest
food
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimple
glass
this
beer
is
one
of
my
top
5
oktoberfest
beers
pours
a
copperamber
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
leaves
good
lace
the
aroma
is
caramelly
malty
grain
cooked
rice
dry
grass
hints
of
pine
and
herb
the
taste
is
caramlyl
malty
grain
strong
and
full
but
still
light
and
tingly
in
feel
with
an
active
palate
clear
herbal
and
nutty
bitterness
more
bitter
than
usual
for
the
style
and
just
enough
to
make
it
more
interesting
spaten
is
a
good
baseline
märzen
i
just
wouldnt
expect
it
too
much
higher
than
that
though
d
look
if
this
was
bottled
in
a
brown
instead
of
green
lookout
america
but
its
not
so
ill
pass
on
another
until
its
on
draft
o
this
beer
had
proper
storage
after
purchase
and
prior
to
consumption
moreover
it
is
unwisely
packaged
in
a
green
bottle
with
no
improvement
given
a
2nd
chance
it
is
appropriate
to
give
it
the
poor
rating
it
deserves
and
to
expect
a
different
sample
to
be
likely
to
suffer
the
same
fate
the
ontap
version
was
clearly
better
with
none
of
the
skunky
offnotes
verdict
a
pretty
enjoyable
import
despite
not
having
a
lot
of
flavor
diversity
and
having
some
unpleasing
skunky
perhaps
metallic
tastes
the
flavor
that
is
here
is
bold
on
a
few
positive
and
negative
levels
not
terrible
but
not
great

drinkability
very
drinkable
das
bier
ist
gut
and
will
never
be
a
stranger
to
my
refrigerator
this
is
a
fairly
mild
oktoberfest
brew
the
nut
flavors
are
pleasant
but
the
skunk
isnt
as
much
im
sure
the
skunkiness
is
from
light
exposure
combined
with
age
d
this
is
the
kind
of
lager
that
should
be
served
during
the
peak
of
summer
not
in
the
middle
of
fall
i
can
see
how
the
german
immigrants
that
came
to
the
states
when
they
started
making
beer
they
were
probably
thinking
of
something
like
this
and
along
the
way
they
just
got
lost
and
aal
came
along
but
this
is
smooth
if
more
lagers
tasted
like
this
i
wouldnt
spend
so
much
time
in
the
belgian
ale
section
d
average
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
interesting
d
ive
seshed
on
this
beer
all
night
long
good
flavor
but
it
is
nice
and
tame
so
you
can
pound
them
not
the
most
remarkable
marzen
ive
had
though
ive
seen
other
reviews
that
really
did
not
like
this
beer
i
actually
kind
of
enjoyed
drinking
this
it
was
october
my
engagement
party
maybe
the
setting
was
right
i
did
not
see
the
pour
drank
out
of
the
bottle
underachieving
smell
malty
grain
smell
taste
had
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
slight
bite
from

it
finished
crisp
and
left
me
wanting
more
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
next
october

i
barely
finished

one
would
not
purchase
again

otherwise
not

d
a
good
drink
and
went
down
really
easily
would
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
i
like
this
beer
the
lack
of
bitterness
and
presence
of
roasted
flavors
is
nice
i
could
probably
go
through
a
few
though
considering
this
is
the
urmärzen
expectations
were
high
and
i
must
say
i
was
let
down
a
little
the
head

full

craggy

the
carbonation

maintains

bordering
on

wish
it
was
a
little
darker
with
bigger
malt
profile
nice
drinkable
beer
its
satisfying
but
doesnt
seem
to
really
express
itself
as
a
nominal
fest
beer
we
were
excited
about
the
legitimacy
of
a
real
marzen
from
a
real
germany
the
look
was
promising
typical
oktoberfest
light
amber
and
clear
not
much
head
or
carbonation
the
residual
did
not
cling
to
the
glass
like
an
exgirlfriend
bazing
the
basic
smellmalty
a
woodshop
memory
also
sprang
into
our
minds
however
the
inability
of
the
smell
to
resonate
brought
the
first
disappointment
of
this
beer
upon
first
taste
i
was
convinced
that
there
might
have
been
a
munich
ohio
this
oktoberfest
is
a
very
malty
beer
and
only
if
you
let
the
flavors
linger
will
you
taste
a
hoppiness
the
beer
itself
was
not
very
carbonated
and
did
not
sit
on
the
palate
at
all
much
like
how
the
smell
didnt
resonate
justin
was
very
disappointed
due
to
his
travels
and
beerperiences
in
germany
despite
the
shortcomings
this
beer
would
not
disappoint
an
experienced
oktoberfester
though
it
is
not
a
special
beer
it
is
a
solid
basic
beer
that
is
not
at
all
bad
tasting
it
has
a
light
body
and
a
pleasant
smell
albeit
fleeting
taking
that
into
consideration
we
rate
this
beer
drinkable
we
expected
more
from
a
munich
oktooberfest
as
this
beer
was
more
of
a
late
augustearly
septemberfest
much
too
basic
but
a
good
general
idea
a
little
more
editing
and
this
beer
could
be
something
amazing
better
luck
next
time
drinkability
this
beer
is
ok
nothing
i
will
seek
out
but
if
someone
offered
this
to
me
at
a
bar
i
would
drink
it
no
problem
german
brews
are
a
nice
change
for
me
from
time
to
time
d
solid
but
not
spectacular
its
drinkable
but
there
are
better
d
smooth
crisp
light
doesnt
fill
one
up
excessively
excellent
excellent
excellent
could
enjoy
this
for
an
entire
long
saturday
afternoon
tailgate
d
easy
drinking
decent
lager
problem
is
though
its
just
not
that
interesting
and
in
fact
is
probably
slightly
bland
d
its
not
the
best
octoberfest
ive
ever
tried
but
its
far
from
the
worst
nothing
complex
but
it
sure
gets
me
in
the
mood
for
the
harvest
season
overall
disappointed
overall
maybe
i
just
dont
like
this
style
of
beer
much
all
in
all
at
the
end
of
the
night
i
had
three
so
that
warrants
drinability
to
me
i
would
highly
reccomned
this
october
2010
new
packaging
and
imo
still
an
outstanding
oktoberfestbier
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
definitly
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
sixer
of
drinkability
for
the
märzen
style
it
has
the
right
elements
but
the
taste
clashes
and
comes
off
as
inconsistent
but
still
has
much
to
be
offered
md
medium
bodied
but
smooth
overall
its
ok
not
great
i
am
guessing
that
the
trip
overseas
has
a
lot
to
do
with
this
on
tap
i
bet
its
a
whole
different
beer
i
found
that
this
beer
had
more
flavor
then
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
but
the
skunk
brings
it
down
had
this
at
the
octoberfest
in
cape
coral
germanamerican
club
poured
into
a
64
oz
pitcher
and
then
into
14
oz
plastic
cups
the
aroma
was
sweet
carmel
and
vegetables
in
the
garden
the
favor
was
heavy
malt
and
sweet
carmelizied
sugars
the
body
was
thick
and
after
a
pitcher
it
was
not
the
easiest
brew
to
be
putting
back
spaten
oktoberfest
urmarzen
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
beige
head
with
decent
retention
the
smell
was
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
little
spice
the
taste
was
lightly
toasted
malt
and
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
some
spices
and
more
balance
coming
through
towards
the
finish
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
just
less
than
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
taste
is
quite
bitter
and
a
bit
grainy
its
got
a
nice
sharp
bite
to
its
thats
very
crisp
and
easy
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
really
creamy
its
decent
but
not
quite
malty
enough
not
bad
but
really
not
extraordinary
these
oktoberfestbeers
are
rather
predictable
pours
a
murky
cloudy
amberbrown
head
and
lacing
are
thin
the
smell
is
rather
sweet
with
some
brown
sugar
molases
notes
grainy
and
toasted
malt
smells
are
mixed
in
with
faint
skunky
smell
underneath
everything
you
can
taste
a
complex
toasty
malty
roasted
grain
flavor
at
first
this
turns
into
a
bitter
somewhat
astringent
alcohol
taste
with
an
oxidized
skunky
aftertaste
im
sure
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
fresh
from
the
vat
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
has
been
around
a
while
i
wanted
to
try
a
marzen
actually
made
in
germany
i
think
i
will
stick
to
domestic
stuff
unless
im
actually
standing
in
munich
recommended
music
pairing
wilco
am
drinkability
very
disappointed
by
this
as
ive
had
it
on
tap
which
was
so
much
better
avoid
this
as
there
are
several
representations
of
the
style
which
are
superior
md
this
is
a
good
maerzen
for
someone
wanting
one
with
a
bit
less
flavor
thats
not
entirely
a
bad
thing
as
the
taste
is
good
just
on
the
lighter
side
d
quite
drinkable
i
only
bought
a
single
and
am
wishing
i
had
bought
more
this
is
the
200th
annual
oktoberfest
in
bavaria
prost
d
does
this
beer
meet
the
definition
of
being
a
fest
beer
the
answer
is
yes
yes
i
can
drink
this
in
mass
quantity
and
yes
i
will
still
enjoy
it
and
yes
i
will
get
snookered
by
its
5
9
abv
strength
this
beer
brings
cheer
like
an
oktoberfest
should
drinkabilty
easy
to
drink
not
bad
flavor
i
could
drink
34
of
these
easy
it
is
a
good
beginner
beer
for
people
that
cant
handle
budweiser
or
coors
etc
anymore
but
for
me
this
is
like
a
light
beer
the
green
bottle
obviously
adds
a
lot
of
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
the
nutty
malt
is
good
but
a
little
strange
slight
lemongrass
notes
come
out
on
the
finish
not
what
i
expected
not
what
i
expect
out
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
the
bready
smell
carries
over
beautifully
into
the
tastes
of
this
brewits
very
pleasant
sweet
maltiness
and
roasty
flavors
carry
this
lightmediumbodied
beer
smoothly
over
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
bottle
in
honor
of
october
i
bought
this
bottle
the
other
day
very
festive
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
reddish
tinger
very
minimal
head
of
white
foam
that
coasters
on
top
malty
grainy
aroma
with
some
sweetness
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
medium
mouthfeel
subtle
sweetness
that
has
a
very
minimal
hop
backend
slight
fruit
type
flavors
as
well
ends
rather
cleanly
and
dry
pretty
easy
drinking
overall
it
is
just
a
shame
that
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
skunk
flavors
to
it
i
am
not
digging
it
too
much
because
of
that
but
if
that
flavor
wasnt
there
i
could
probably
drink
more
of
it
not
to
drinkable
for
me
the
color
is
dark
yellow
head
is
light
and
foamy
lacing
is
moderate
the
smell
is
skunky
banana
peel
rock
and
rye
prunes
stale
beer
cups
the
taste
is
not
good
actually
pretty
bad
just
straight
macro
flavors
but
a
bit
thicker
similar
to
a
cheap
malt
liquor
skunk
grass
old
lemon
rinds
newspaper
ink
tastes
like
it
was
run
through
twenty
feet
of
aluminum
gutters
and
drained
out
over
the
driveway
how
did
this
beer
go
so
wrong
spaten
i
thought
that
was
a
decent
beer
not
in
this
case
the
mouthfeel
is
gunky
and
chewy
and
the
carbonation
is
just
an
afterthought
drinkability
is
close
to
a
zero
cant
see
why
youd
want
another
unless
youre
stuck
with
a
six
pack
like
me
bad
beer
overall
cheap
octoberfests
like
berghoff
are
better
than
this
horrible
not
an
everyday
beer
but
for
celebratory
times
when
i
tend
to
have
it
it
works
well
definitely
a
drink
to
keep
in
mind
on
tap
the
beer
engine
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
smell
is
much
more
fruity
than
others
i
had
this
next
to
the
paulaner
and
it
was
remarkable
how
much
more
sweet
grape
fruit
smell
this
had
some
mild
hops
and
toasted
malt
round
out
the
smell
nice
but
id
like
more
toasty
presence
from
the
munich
malt
this
is
just
plane
jane
in
the
malt
department
almost
coming
off
as
a
pilsner
at
times
clear
tawny
amber
with
an
offwhite
cap
of
fine
bubbles
decent
head
retention
a
bit
of
shortlived
lacing
malty
aroma
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
sweet
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
bitterness
was
less
pronounced
than
the
malt
sweetness
but
it
provided
balance
up
front
and
lingered
in
the
finish
hops
were
slightly
herbal
floral
caramel
sweetness
and
toasted
character
throughout
not
overly
dry
medium
to
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
decent
overall
d
standard
easy
palate
would
have
another
one
on
the
palate
weve
got
a
large
amount
of
toasted
flavor
in
fact
i
cant
say
that
i
find
the
hint
of
toasted
biscuits
totally
disagreeable
however
while
the
finish
brings
in
a
moderate
hop
effect
and
a
bit
of
puckering
astringency
im
left
with
a
takeitorleaveit
feeling
d
slight
bite
in
the
middle
but
not
offputting
this
beer
has
an
amber
colour
and
a
1finger
head
that
sticks
around
due
to
the
good
carbonation
it
smells
like
cheap
grainy
beer
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
not
great
it
feels
pretty
watery
but
the
carbonation
gives
it
some
interest
at
least
drinkabilitythis
has
a
good
palatability
is
fairly
smooth
and
has
a
light
lingering
taste
that
make
me
want
to
drink
more
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
the
abv
on
this
is
a
little
higher
but
it
goes
down
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
well
it
was
easy
to
drink
the
whole
sixer
of
i
think
of
this
being
the
defining
oktoberfest
beer
to
me
i
think
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
not
just
based
on
taste
though
dont
get
me
wrong
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beers
taste
most
of
the
time
like
anything
that
comes
from
munich
its
been
on
a
boat
for
a
while
so
some
time
its
great
because
it
just
got
off
the
boat
other
times
you
can
tell
its
been
on
the
boat
but
its
not
over
priced
and
its
worth
the
extra
for
an
import
a
lot
of
american
breweries
make
a
decent
oktoberfest
beer
but
theres
something
about
a
real
munich
brewed
beer
during
oktoberfest
or
it
could
be
the
fact
that
my
dads
spaten
oktoberfest
1968
mug
was
in
view
of
my
crib
although
brewed
for
export
spaten
has
not
held
back
on
this
traditional
fullbodied
upfront
festive
favorite
is
this
a
full
liter
i
hardly
noticed
and
could
easily
put
down
another
send
me
to
munich
the
have
this
on
draft
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
on
the
upper
west
side
what
a
great
beer
for
this
time
of
year
and
it
came
with
special
20
ounce
steinstyle
glasses
great
easy
drinker
thats
light
enough
to
easily
enjoy
20
or
40
ounces
of
and
still
feel
good
at
the
same
time
great
malt
flavor
and
aroma
mouthfeel
is
slightly
weaker
than
i
antcipated
still
a
nice
oktoberfest
but
i
would
love
nothing
more
than
to
try
this
on
draft
over
in
germany
drinkability
is
ok
but
could
use
more
carbonation
to
cut
the
thickness
and
cleanse
the
palate
from
carrying
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
fair
to
midland
oktoberfest
this
is
a
decent
offering
but
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
many
oktoberfest
beers
yet
but
i
did
expect
more
from
one
also
being
brewed
by
spaten
i
expected
more
as
well
in
general
while
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
to
drink
it
seems
lacking
for
its
style
i
do
enjoy
the
beer
i
just
wish
i
had
more
to
say
about
it
there
is
not
much
to
praise
it
for
this
beer
is
really
tasty
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
when
you
are
looking
forward
to
a
nice
rich
toasty
caramely
and
chewy
oktoberfest
if
you
know
what
you
are
getting
into
though
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
pretty
good
tasting
german
lager
i
dont
know
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
very
traditional
but
compared
to
contemporary
offerings
doesnt
quite
stand
up
i
was
also
fortunate
to
not
have
a
skunked
bottle
but
id
prefer
they
fix
that
issue
d
beyond
the
skunk
i
would
imagine
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
but
unfortunatlly
all
i
got
was
a
lot
of
skunk
glad
to
be
back
d
skunkiness
ruined
this
bottle
dont
know
how
it
skunked
as
i
took
it
out
of
the
store
at
night
sigh
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
and
give
it
one
more
opportunity
this
might
be
something
to
offer
your
guests
who
dont
like
hoppy
or
thick
beers
it
really
was
neither
offputting
nor
impressive
with
me
for
an
oktoberfest
i
was
expecting
more
malt
and
less
macro
euro
mess
this
is
overall
it
was
an
average
beer
and
there
are
better
beers
out
there
that
represent
the
style
better
i
still
recommend
to
try
this
though
drinkability
while
it
at
least
does
not
have
the
too
sweet
caramel
backbone
that
many
us
examples
do
the
strong
medicinal
presence
is
just
as
bad
not
a
particularly
good
marzen
still
it
gets
the
job
done
and
is
better
if
paired
with
hearty
food
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
just
not
very
impressive
however
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinker
its
very
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
just
not
a
great
example
cheers
drink
other
marzens
instead
i
dont
care
if
this
purports
to
be
the
first
of
the
style
it
is
not
good
and
other
marzensoktoberfestbiers
are
good
and
your
should
drink
them
and
not
this
this
beer
is
just
ok
if
youve
had
spatens
optimator
doppelbock
and
can
tolerate
a
bit
of
skunk
you
will
like
this
beer
as
it
tastes
like
a
5050
mix
of
heineken
and
optimator
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
its
well
worth
the
1
per
bottle
paid
at
costco
and
is
a
decent
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
when
the
good
stuff
runs
out
local
german
beer
hall
gets
this
beer
in
on
tap
every
year
amber
color
with
white
head
that
disappear
somewhat
quickly
without
lacing
smell
is
little
above
the
average
for
the
style
the
best
tasting
oktoberfest
ive
had
yet
i
have
had
it
from
the
bottle
before
but
its
much
better
on
tap
as
long
as
its
available
on
tap
id
be
able
to
drink
it
during
an
afternoon
at
the
beer
hall
so
far
my
favorite
oktoberfest
yet
dhas
sort
of
a
yucky
aftertaste
that
builds
through
experience
plus
unwelcomed
bitterness
really
starts
to
come
out
d
without
the
skunking
the
presentation
alone
says
drink
me
i
am
festbier
but
as
it
was
skunked
and
out
of
place
on
a
rhode
island
kitchen
table
surrounded
by
superior
competition
it
does
not
find

mouthfeel
sucks
like
weak

water
however
i
think
it
is
a
rather
drinkable
beer
for
the
autumn
season
first
off
i
think
this
brew
is
underrated
it
has
a
great
looking
pour
with
a
big
beige
head
color
is
of
deep
caramel
kind
of
a
pungent
smell
of
sour
apples
has
a
piney
taste
to
it
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
bitterness
medium
body
and
big
carbonation
moderately
high
alcohol
content
and
you
can
taste
it
going
down
crisp
finish
spaten
is
a
great
brewery
and
they
damn
sure
know
their
beer
not
too
bad
but
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
bit
more
kick
to
it
this
is
a
beer
for
the
masses
and
for
pounding
not
one
for
me
to
sit
and
sip
while
i
review
pours
clean
and
clear
copperorange
with
a
twofinger
white
head
mild
nose
with
only
a
hint
of
the
green
bottle
euro
skunk
mostly
subdued
hops
this
is
a
crisp
beer
with
mid
to
high
carbonation
peppery
hops
with
a
nice
balanced
malt
backdrop
that
provides
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
is
one
of
the
better
import
brews
of
this
style
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
oktoberfest
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
supposedly
this
is
the
beer
that
started
all
for
oktoberfest
so
im
hoping
if
i
ever
make
it
to
the
real
thing
the
beer
is
a
bit
better
simply
put
it
taste
like
a
macro
lager
with
a
couple
traditional
but
low
quality
maerzen
style
ingredients
added
in
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
finger
of
head
good
clarity
with
little
to
no
lacing
color
is
a
amberbrown
smell
is
bready
with
a
mild
grassy
hop
aroma
taste
is
very
mild
bread
and
caramel
malts
and
just
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fullbodied
with
a
clean
finish
decent
marzen
but
nothing
to
seek
out
drinkability
is
solid
this
is
by
far
the
best
marzen
from
germany
i
have
had
but
still
the
americans
give
you
a
rich
robust
malt
flavor
the
germans
lack
probably
better
than
previous
years
that
i
have
tried
this
style
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
germans
make
the
best
marzens
spaten
does
very
well
a
solid
brew
in
a
great
season
the
most
wonderful
time
of
the
yearoktoberfest
from
the
nation
that
made
beer
what
it
should
be
at
least
before
the
great
american
microbrew
revolution
came
along
i
love
it
spaten
is
always
exceptional
in
my
book
pretty
low
aftertaste
makes
this
beer
almost
undrinkable
drinkability
very
easy
to
session
and
drink
down
quick
while
at
the
bar
has
nice
balance
and
thankfullly
walks
the
line
perfectly
of
giving
you
the
malts
you
want
in
an
octoberfest
while
still
not
being
to
sweet
definitely
nice
example
of
the
style
and
worth
trying
one
to
session
and
not
overally
have
to
focus
on
but
enjoy
each
sip
spaten
oktoberfestbier
is
an
okay
beer
spaten
makes
much
better
beers
than
this
or
at
least
beers
that
travel
much
better
than
this
one
the
beer
is
not
terrible
tasting
but
there
isnt
much
there
except
for
a
little
breadiness
but
otherwise
the
rich
malt
flavor
i
was
expecting
was
missing
and
the
hops
did
not
taste
as
crisp
as
they
should
be
in
a
german
lager
the
beer
finished
dry
but
a
little
astringent
and
metallic
d
4
after
only
one
liter
i
would
likely
be
reeling
but
after
a
12
oz
glass
id
not
object
to
more
could
stand
to
be
slightly
less
sweet
and
more
vibrant
strange
to
me
that
these
light
colored
ofests
are
so
sweet
but
im
having
a
hard
time
finding
an
amber
version
thats
sweet
enough
overall
i
was
expecting
wayyyy
more
out
of
this
brew
nothing
special
at
all
crisp
carbonation
very
drinkable
malty
aftertaste
this
is
was
surprisingly
nice
it
is
straightforward
and
not
complex
but
it
was
a
very
nice
oktoberfestmarzen
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
tastebetter
than
the
smell
but
still
muted
notes
of
malt
faint
hop
note
leading
to
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
not
exactly
huge
in
the
flavor
department
but
no
telling
how
long
it
had
been
on
the
shelf
would
love
a
fresh
one
for
comparison
d
easy
drinking
and
a
good
pair
for
grill
food
this
is
definitely
not
one
to
blow
you
away
but
a
good
choice
for
informal
consumption
there
isnt
really
much
to
this
simple
but
classic
octoberfest
as
my
buddy
put
it
the
original
nice
body
taste
and
feeling
when
you
drink
this
nice
balance
of
light
hops
with
some
great
roasted
malty
tones
to
the
finish
with
the
low
adv
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
to
enjoy
for
an
evening
i
will
admit
although
the
beer
was
nice
and
fresh
enjoying
a
nice
fall
season
beer
when
its
85
outside
in
august
didnt
really
seem
right
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
this
as
the
leaves
change
dark
amber
color
almost
a
brown
sweet
smell
with
a
thin
head
rich
flavor
with
a
bit
of
chocolatecocoa
powder
on
the
palate
thin
body
that
dissipates
quickly
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
that
is
also
rich
not
one
to
drink
one
after
another
while
camping
but
one
to
savor
in
autumn
perhaps
round
the
fire
d
a
fine
beer
perhaps
needs
a
little
age
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
overalldecent
fest
bier
solid
drinking
no
real
complaints
that
said
it
didnt
wow
me
overall
this
years
is
real
good
i
think
i
had
last
years
and
the
year
before
that
they
were
orange
this
one
is
brown
or
dark
amber
with
more
complex
flavors
d
the
abv
is
higher
than
many
session
beers
but
this
is
still
a
decent
sixinanight
beer
i
expected
a
little
bit
better
from
spaten
though
id
probably
stick
with
their
regular
lager
and
switch
to
hacker
schorr
for
an
oktoberfest
drinkability
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
much
complexity
though
but
that
might
be
fairly
typical
of
a
maerzen
fairly
easy
to
come
back
to
but
the
bitter
aftertaste
might
need
food
to
help
balance
it
out
d
the
beer
goes
down
easily
but
nothing
really
stands
in
the
taste
to
make
me
want
another
one
of
these
except
maybe
during
the
oktoberfest
season
i
have
to
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
last
reviewer
while
unimpressed
with
recent
spaten
okur
vintages
this
one
is
seriously
worth
another
try
very
very
drinkable
round
malty
with
just
enough
hop
at
the
end
to
make
you
want
more
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
this
years
batch
tastes
darn
close
to
fresh
munchen
amber
heaven
i
recommend
you
retry
this
one
mistakenly
mislead
by
a
retailer
who
was
talking
out
of
his
a
one
finger
off
white
head
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
very
light
copper
amber
clear
body
minimal
carbonation
visible
the
nose
features
a
bit
of
toasted
very
subtle
roast
malt
floral
hops
for
balance
taste
mirrors
the
nose
very
floral
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
minimal
effervescence
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
certainly
see
myself
quaffing
several
big
steins
of
this
in
munich
next
fall
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
marzens
ive
had
but
given
the
historical
importance
of
this
beer
im
certainly
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
d
its
good
for
its
style
fun
and
festive
underwhelming
in
so
many
areas
but
at
least
it
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
style
this
brings
the
drinkability
back
up
to
average
d
very
drinkable
im
enjoying
this
right
now
on
95
degree
day
in
florida
not
usually
my
style
of
brew
but
the
medium
body
of
this
copper
brew
won
me
over
a
bit
a
little
malty
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
little
twist
of
citrus
in
there
overall
well
balanced
if
not
overly
enjoyable
very
decent
beer
drinkable
though
this
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
oktoberfest
brew
the
spaten
brand
is
often
available
here
where
i
live
ill
have
to
go
to
it
more
often
if
they
do
this
well
d
wellcrafted
and
highly
drinkable
spaten
is
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
and
im
glad
its
available
all
year
long
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
have
been
much
better
ill
probably
revisit
a
fresh
one
this
coming
fall
and
see
if
my
perception
of
this
beer
may
change
d
not
bad
but
it
hardly
seems
to
be
an
ofest
at
least
not
stylistically
stereotypical
it
is
not
very
malty
especially
light
on
the
caramel
notes
and
the
hops
seem
almost
restrained
not
exactly
the
robust
life
of
the
party
with
the
darker
color
dryness
body
toward
the
thin
side
fruitiness
and
lightish
biscuity
malt
is
it
maybe
an
altoberfest
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
fresh
stock
the
more
it
sits
in
a
fridge
the
lower
quality
of
taste
and
freshness
the
golden
brown
color
has
that
crispy
taste
that
goes
down
rough
it
does
have
a
skunkyness
to
it
that
many
others
have
talked
about
i
have
had
this
ontap
in
munich
and
thats
where
you
probably
want
to
drink
it
once
its
bottled
the
taste
and
freshness
get
totally
ruined
when
you
drink
this
beer
keep
in
mind
that
the
germans
perfected
beer
and
treat
it
as
such
medium
bodied
with
a
little
more
carbonation
than
needed
an
easy
drinker
overall
okay
on
its
own
but
much
better
as
a
food
pairing
this
wont
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
in
any
category
but
is
nonetheless
enjoyable
d
ever
since
epcot
i
love
this
stuff
its
not
too
heavy
yet
so
flavorful
the
germans
did
good
oh
and
5
9
alc
is
great
too
haha
d
fairly
easy
drinking
and
overall
enjoyable
enough
to
make
this
one
where
you
could
come
back
to
it
over
an
afternoonevening
with
company
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
mug
a
beautiful
deep
gold
minimal
head
went
away
quick
a
one
of
the
best
appearing
beers
ive
ever
had
deep
gold
like
vanilla
cream
soda
s
aroma
was
of
biscuits
caramel
t
flavor
was
perfect
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
very
well
balanced
m
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
spread
flavor
to
entire
mouth
d
what
a
shame
i
only
had
one
was
the
perfect
pairing
w
pork
sauerkraut
we
had
for
dinner
overall
an
outstanding
beer
only
knock
was
lack
of
head
but
the
overall
experience
more
than
made
up
for
it
spatens
octoberfest
brew
is
exceptional
ontap
once
i
had
it
ontap
i
was
very
happy
to
find
it
in
bottles
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
bottle
though
its
just
not
the
same
as
on
draft
its
a
little
more
flavorful
than
the
traditional
american
octoberfest
brew
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
it
is
a
must
it
has
a
light
body
for
an
oktoberfest
and
is
decent
in
the
drinkability
department
its
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
bad
beer
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
the
drinkability
is
really
high
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
slight
sour
tinge
to
it
after
the
sweetness
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
overall
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
the
bitterness
was
a
nice
surprise
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
a
good
one
spaten
oktoberfest
is
a
colored
seltzer
and
about
as
flavorful
the
beer
is
not
recommended
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
slightly
sweet
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
brew
as
it
says
on
my
page
marzen
oktoberfest
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
and
has
a
medium
head
that
is
full
hop
and
malt
aroma
when
you
taste
it
your
thirst
is
gone
it
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
to
bitter
and
is
light
enough
where
you
can
have
multiple
and
have
room
for
more
great
beer
poured
this
beer
into
a
pilsner
glass
from
a
bottle
it
formed
an
offwhite
head
that
left
no
lacing
from
the
12
head
it
had
a
faint
smell
of
hops
and
malt
after
initial
pour
but
after
a
while
a
slight
toasted
malt
and
caramel
smell
emerged
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
can
only
be
described
as
light
the
taste
begins
bitter
and
ends
smooth
decent
beer
but
i
cant
imagine
it
standing
up
to
most
of
the
hearty
bavarian
food
from
its
homeland
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
it
has
the
components
present
enough
to
make
it
fairly
drinkable
despite
having
no
outstanding
spots
drinkability
very
sessionable
drank
a
liter
of
this
stuff
and
it
went
down
very
easily
great
session
beer
shows
an
clear
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
froth
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
simple
with
aromas
of
grains
mild
hop
spiciness
caramel
light
skunkiness
a
hint
of
lemon
the
beer
is
dry
with
a
lean
mouthfeel
and
flavors
of
grains
noble
hops
subtle
caramel
a
lemonlike
acidity
on
the
finish
overall
the
beer
is
very
simple
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
expected
from
this
style
ill
be
honest
im
not
a
real
fan
of
this
style
but
ive
had
a
few
beers
that
i
really
enjoy
unfortunately
that
isnt
the
case
here
ive
been
to
munich
many
times
including
8
ofests
this
bottled
beer
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
draught
marzens
ive
had
from
spaten
over
the
years
reminded
me
of
sugared
water
i
think
that
this
is
a
real
drinkable
refreshing
beer
i
look
forward
to
finding
it
on
tap
notes
again
a
good
beer
but
a
definite
export
oktoberfest
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
in
germany
but
the
imported
version
tastes
like
standard
green
bottle
european
beer
very
nice
color
served
up
nice
smell
was
very
typical
but
nice
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
there
is
a
faint
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
if
they
smoothed
out
that
faint
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
near
perfect
brew
this
it
the
type
of
beer
i
like
so
im
probably
a
bit
more
critical
on
this
this
brew
pours
ok
and
is
a
deep
amber
color
i
had
this
in
germany
a
long
time
ago
and
remember
liking
it
but
spent
most
time
at
the
hacker
pschorr
tent
the
beer
is
malty
buiscity
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
while
not
skunked
or
maybe
it
was
theres
a
nastiness
there
that
has
me
wondering
about
the
rest
of
the
sixer
good
enough
to
drink
bad
enough
to
never
bother
with
again
i
like
their
optimator
ill
stick
with
that
decent
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
glass
sweet
malty
smell
slightly
bitter
citrusy
taste
not
a
heavy
beer
very
solid
but
it
just
seems
to
lack
something
i
dont
think
this
would
be
the
best
session
beer
but
a
few
would
go
good
paired
with
sauerbraten
or
a
nice
steak
for
an
oktoberfest
ill
stick
with
blue
point
tastes
pretty
good
but
would
wear
on
me
after
2
or
3
maltiness
is
tempered
with
a
unpleasant
and
lingering
astringencyoffputting
citrus
note
starts
like
an
amber
finishes
like
a
weak
bock
a
weird
almost
pumpkinish
sweetness
that
pulls
a
180
and
turns
into
a
dry
buttermilk
blah
not
very
good
i
wanna
real
beer
not
one
that
just
comes
from
beer
central
and
looks
good
on
the
label
overpriced
about
equal
with
a
shiner
bock
but
cost
about
4
dollars
more
it
starts
with
a
rather
dry
cider
flavour
infused
with
yeastiness
before
slowly
sweetening
on
the
tongue
to
leave
a
sweet
hint
of
bock
pours
a
copper
colored
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
did
not
last
faint
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
flowery
hops
mouthfeel
was
light
waterery
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
flavors
were
sweet
and
but
not
very
refreshing
it
has
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
drinkability
was
watered
down
not
very
impressive
gonna
have
to
choke
down
3
more
bottles
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
certainly
prefer
it
to
spatens
regular
offering
but
nothing
special
either
poured
a
dark
copper
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fell
to
a
cap
faint
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
flowery
hops
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
crip
carbonation
flavors
were
sweet
and
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
good
drinkability
d
a
very
average
take
on
the
style
and
drinks
like
it
drinkability
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
macrobrewed
attempt
at
an
oktoberfest
seemed
thinned
down
and
lacking
character
wont
drink
this
again
unless
i
get
it
before
it
makes
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
d
easy
drinking
not
overly
complex
good
beer
for
a
cool
fall
evening
d
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
even
for
the
bud
light
drinker
of
the
bunch
i
love
this
beer
and
would
reccomend
it
to
everyone
overall
this
is
a
solid
octoberfest
if
nothing
that
outstanding
certainly
not
the
first
octoberfestmarzen
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
want
this
malty
autumn
style
but
you
really
cant
go
wrong
here
either
d
fairly
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
the
flavor
matches
up
with
a
decent
classic
festbier
another
lager
that
i
like
add
it
to
the
list
reminds
me
of
negro
modelo
in
some
ways
just
now
getting
around
to
the
octoberfestseasonal
beers
also
got
the
sam
adams
and
dfh
pumpkin
12
oz
bottle
from
make
your
own
six
pack
to
glass
looks
like
dark
ice
tea
mostly
get
malt
on
the
nose
very
inviting
good
sweet
flavors
and
just
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
carbonation
was
noticeable
but
just
about
right
very
easy
to
drink
but
noticed
the
alcohol
effects
quickly
too
drinkability
wonderfully
drinkable
one
of
the
best
known
oktoberfest
beer
and
rightfully
so
crisp
and
clean
with
nicely
balanced
flavours
and
a
great
looking
beer
i
must
be
picky
in
wanting
my
marzens
with
less
viennapils
malts
just
so
dominant
i
want
to
back
those
down
and
let
more
caramel
and
toffee
come
through
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
has
a
dark
amber
color
to
it
certainly
on
the
darker
side
of
amber
but
light
enough
to
be
away
from
the
brown
color
it
has
excellent
clarity
to
it
at
first
it
has
a
fizzy
white
looking
head
to
it
but
it
ended
up
with
close
to
average
lacing
not
too
much
stick
to
the
glass
but
the
lace
kind
of
slide
down
to
the
liquid
after
each
time
you
took
a
drink
there
really
wasnt
much
to
the
smell
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
maltymetallic
smell
but
it
was
pretty
weak
the
taste
saves
it
a
bit
i
found
it
pretty
malty
and
sweet
certainly
picked
up
on
some
caramelized
malts
nothing
about
the
taste
was
overly
strong
though
i
actually
found
it
quite
on
the
lighter
side
the
mouthfeel
was
good
extremely
light
though
this
was
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
couldnt
believe
how
fast
i
drank
it
i
just
remember
looking
at
the
glass
and
it
was
already
just
about
gone
certainly
not
a
very
hearty
beer
not
something
i
would
like
or
normally
like
to
drink
in
the
fall
more
of
a
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
d
no
thanks
on
another
and
i
wont
buy
again
does
go
down
easy
d
very
easily
sessioned
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
d
a
decent
drinker
d
light
and
crisp
and
finishes
pretty
well
goes
down
easy
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
a
few
of
these
but
there
are
definitely
better
options
out
there
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
spaten
is
the
reason
i
look
forward
to
the
fall
its
deep
ruddy
brown
color
is
pleasing
to
the
eyes
more
so
when
looking
at
it
down
the
barrel
of
a
huge
32
oz
mug
the
smell
speaks
of
the
experience
behind
spatens
brewing
these
guys
know
how
to
make
a
friggin
beer
the
first
sip
betrays
hints
of
sassafras
and
mint
that
stay
with
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
is
a
little
creamier
than
other
oktoberfestbiers
but
i
like
that
it
serves
to
make
a
rich
and
foamy
head
if
you
find
it
on
tap
call
a
friend
to
drive
you
home
because
youre
going
to
want
to
drink
as
much
of
it
as
your
can
remember
in
the
movie
beerfest
when
the
guys
find
that
secret
beer
recipe
hidden
in
the
doll
and
theyre
all
talking
about
how
they
want
to
ice
skate
on
it
or
are
simply
moved
to
tears
by
how
delicious
it
is
i
like
to
imagine
that
beer
tastes
like
spaten
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
is
rich
an
very
refreshing
like
most
munich
beers

would
be
good
for

balanced
and

it
is
easy
to
drink
just
not
sure
i
would
have
more
than
one
if
other
fests
were
available
drinkability
very
refreshing
i
cant
stress
how
easy
this
was
to
quaff
its
an
great
combination
of
lightrefreshing
and
substantial
at
the
same
time
and
at
only
5

its
something
you
can
definitely
have
a
few
of
good
seasonal
from
a
consistantly
good
brewery
drinkability
a
solid
beer
overall
i
would
buy
this
again
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
certinally
a
delicious
oktoberfestbier
though
the
first
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
the
sweet
toasty
malts
crating
the
rest
of
the
character
after
the
initial
hit
this
well
balanced
marzen
leaves
behind
a
bit
more
of
the
hops
then
the
malts
giving
it
a
clean
finish
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
simple
and
humble
and
very
drinkable
and
for
the
price
an
economical
choice
too
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
watery
but
im
not
sure
if
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
really
heavy
or
sticky
had
this
on
tap
at
fox
and
the
hound
came
out
a
little
flat
but
im
guessing
it
wasnt
the
beers
fault
smells
sweet
and
munichmalty
a
little
grasssy
maybe
from
some
hops
tastes
sweet
maybe
a
little
cloying
definately
some
european
hop
characteristics
in
there
flowery
etc
no
real
bitterness
drinks
easy
though
been
having
a
bunch
of
these
marzens
lately
and
honestly
i
prefer
pauleners
sam
adams
and
real
ales
to
this
but
not
bad
if
its
the
only
thing
around
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
this
one
has
a
very
clean
and
well
balanced
character
with
a
traditional
oktoberfest
flavor
however
i
would
like
to
see
the
green
bottles
replaced
with
brown
to
prevent
light
spoil
all
in
all
the
contents
are
pretty
classic
unfortunately
this
bottle
seems
slightly
skunked
not
bad
but
not
ideal
the
perils
of
the
green
bottle
nothing
overly
impressive
or
mindblowing
here
but
it
is
a
decent
tasting
beer
and
could
definitely
be
quaffed
in
large
quantities
useful
as
a
gateway
to
the
big
beers
of
winter
d
very
drinkable
the
hop
presence
was
a
nice
addition
to
this
solid
oktoberfest
very
sessionable
i
could
have
several
of
these
good
marzen
but
tends
to
get
a
bit
sweet
and
lacks
the
depth
of
better
version
im
trying
this
beer
against
ayingers
version
this
beer
pours
a
darkish
brownamber
completely
clear
with
a
small
white
head
bubbles
stick
around
nicely
though
the
aroma
is
malty
and
clean
but
quite
light
theres
no
off
note
that
can
creep
into
lighter
german
imports
theres
a
touch
of
apples
and
grapes
detectable
as
well
the
flavor
comes
through
more
strongly
vinous
with
a
light
but
fruity
malt
it
gets
just
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
finish
but
im
sure
that
id
lose
sight
of
that
quickly
if
i
were
drinking
it
any
quantity
while
both
this
beer
and
the
ayinger
would
be
easy
to
drink
all
night
i
have
to
give
the
nod
to
ayinger
still
spaten
puts
out
a
nice
marzen
with
a
relatively
low
price
tag
overall
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
oktoberfests
but
it
is
highly
competent
and
is
very
drinkable
this
isnt
the
best
marzen
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
the
first
one
i
buy
every
year
then
measure
the
rest
against
it
would
love
to
try
it
before
it
made
the
trip
over
not
a
terrible
oktoberfest
but
ive
had
better
for
the
same
price
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
sampled
the
flavors
balance
well
but
without
the
cloying
sweetness
of
some
examples
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
and
will
certainly
be
looking
for
a
chance
to
have
another
one
during
this
fall
season
the
drinkability
wasnt
bad
but
i
didnt
feel
the
need
to
ask
for
another
pint
a
very
blah
member
of
the
style
at
least
the
tap
i
had
seems
more
watery
and
blase

warrant

a

up
considerably
thereafter
with

pretty
good
oktoberfestbier
this
is
definitely
a
fall
beer
i
would
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
you
wont
be
blown
away
by
this
but
it
is
satisfying
drinkability
a
decent
oktoberfest
probably
not
worth
the
price
of
an
import
but
you
could
do
much
much
worse
rusty
copper
with
a
big
rocky
head
of
cream
colored
foam
a
little
whiff
of
skunkiness
hit
me
right
as
i
cracked
the
cap
but
is
gone
after
sitting
for
a
moment
and
is
replaced
by
fresh
breadiness
and
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
flavors
are
pretty
spot
on
for
an
ofest
rich
and
malty
toffee
flavor
with
bready
yeast
and
a
faint
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
that
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
in
large
portions
i
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
this
beer
as
ive
probably
had
about
a
thousand
of
these
over
the
years
i
am
also
surprised
by
the
relatively
low
scores
it
has
recieved
i
guess
i
just
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
and
it
always
reminds
me
of
good
fall
weather
spaten
does
this
to
me
since
it
was
the
first
imported
oktoberfest
i
ever
tasted
way
back
when
and
it
has
remained
a
favorite
to
me
ever
since
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
one
would
expect
from
an
authentic
german
oktoberfest
bier
the
appearance
is
great
with
a
deep
golden
color
the
aromas
are
exactly
what
youd
expect
but
the
flavors
fall
a
bit
short
its
better
than
most
american
impersonators
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
appearance
or
the
expectations
of
this
real
deal
german
oktoberfest
o
disappointing
oktoberfest
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
taste
has
a
good
blend
of
malt
spice
and
hops
too
be
sure
the
hops
are
the
least
as
the
sweetness
and
malt
blend
well
to
produce
a
easy
drinking
beer
some
caramel
is
detected
in
the
back
the
hops
serves
as
a
cleansing
agent
and
brings
the
beer
out
in
the
open
i
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
dry
and
sharp
this
is
kind
of
like
the
sparkling
wine
of
octoberfests
the
carbonation
is
nonstop
the
flavor
is
very
good
i
could
have
up
to
three
of
these
currently
in
my
top
four
of
this
style
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
more
resonant
of
a
brown
ale
than
an
oktoberfest
the
smell
is
quite
strangeit
reminds
me
more
of
a
strong
czech
pilsner
than
a
marzen
the
taste
returns
to
the
world
of
german
marzens
with
a
deep
roasty
malt
character
balanced
somewhat
by
dry
european
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
on
this
relativelycool
virginia
evening
d
very
drinkable
hence
its
meant
to
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
drinkability
is
great
as
it
is
with
most
oktoberfests
i
have
had
better
versions
but
as
usual
this
style
has
a
good
balance
and
is
brewed
to
be
able
to
drink
all
day
with
massive
quantities
im
in
prost
pretty
tasty
brew
but
the
aroma
is
not
so
pleasant
drinkability
seriously
high
this
is
an
oktoberfest
thats
as
refreshing
to
drink
alone
as
it
is
with
food
i
typically
expect
a
little
fuller
richer
feel
and
taste
from
the
style
but
this
one
is
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable
all
day
drinability
drink
the
hell
outta
it
drinkability
tasty
enough
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
particularly
complex
even
for
the
style
so
i
might
want
to
switch
it
up
after
a
liter
d
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
i
think
i
would
have
been
better
off
with
the
regular
spaten
oktoberfest
beer
not
terrible
but
not
terribly
enjoyable
either
drinkability
is
good
i
would
happily
session
on
this
there
are
better
hackerpshoor
and
legend
from
virginia
being
two
d
an
alright
beer
it
just
really
has
nothing
going
for
it
yes
it
has
flavor
but
not
much
fine
for
a
session
but
just
a
tad
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
than
this
one
mouth
feel
is
very
lightbodied
with
light
carbonation
that
combines
to
make
this
an
extremely
easydrinking
beer
being
a
fan
of
maltforward
beers
i
really
like
this
one
d
something
about
this
marzen
has
always
been
undrinkable
to
me
the
mix
of
extreme
malt
and
random
spice
kind
of
leaves
a
soapy
residue
in
my
mouth
pours
a
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
bready
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
with
some
nice
hops
in
the
profile
it
finishes
with
some
sweet
malts
overall
a
nice
marzen
for
this
time
of
the
year
spaten
has
some
good
brews
try
them
t
slightly
bitter
pilsner
taste
to
it
some
spice
perhaps
some
caramel
slight
malt
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
crisp
refreshing
oktoberfest
the
overall
experience
is
enjoyable
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
not
the
best
oktoberfest
that
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
enjoyable
just
the
same
d
this
beer
has
still
been
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
oktoberfests
just
a
great
smooth
malty
taste
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
beer
all
day
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
drink
with
some
nice
german
food
and
spaten
does
a
great
job
with
it
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
version
of
this
bier
at
oktoberfest
and
it
is
even
better
there
in
keg
and
bottle
form
it
still
is
one
of
the
best
fest
biers
around
i
strongly
recommend
it
prosit
nice
medium
bodied
easy
drinking
beer
that
satisfies
on
a
cool
latesummer
afternoon
this
is
great
beer
all
around
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
imports
when
i
was
too
young
to
know
better
this
was
the
beer
that
made
me
want
go
to
munich
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
spaten
it
has
a
red
slightly
orange
body
the
head
is
full
and
off
white
with
awesome
lace
neither
the
hops
nor
the
malt
are
overwhelming
this
beer
leans
more
to
the
malt
but
it
is
balanced
for
the
most
part
it
has
a
thin
refreshing
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
d
a
nice
refreshing
beer
this
one
i
will
drink
again
looks
like
a
nice
amberish
ale
with
a
quick
disipation
on
the
foam
head
smells
like
an
adjunct
but
it
has
a
sweet
malty
profile
very
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
very
very
good
balance
nice
carbonation
and
tastes
of
barely
and
sweet
corn
mf
is
very
light
and
is
very
easily
drinkin
i
had
this
several
years
ago
and
seemed
to
remember
it
being
heavier
in
body
and
flavor
it
is
quaffable
and
hides
its
5
9
abv
well
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
oktoberfest
season
the
best
i
can
compare
this
too
is
blackened
voodoo
meets
seltzer
water
and
burned
grass
welcome
back
oktoberfest
you
were
missed
thoroughly
less
than
24
at
sams
club
for
a
case
of
bottles
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
who
says
it
has
to
be
october
to
enjoy
this
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
its
august
and
its
readily
available
i
say
drink
it
while
its
here
balanced
and
tasty
a
little
thinner
in
body
than
i
would
have
liked
and
im
not
sold
on
the
bitterness
of
the
finish
just
average
for
me
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
coloring
with
a
half
finger
of
thick
creamy
head
head
recedes
to
a
film
with
only
spotty
lacing
left
behind
nose
is
graininess
grassy
caramel
malts
and
a
slightly
sourmusty
smell
taste
is
grains
and
extremely
sweet
malts
a
touch
of
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
must
in
the
flavor
lighter
to
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
dry
finish
with
an
oddoff
aftertaste
if
you
are
looking
for
a
marzenoktoberfest
there
are
better
offerings
of
this
style
d
for
me
and
i
think
for
most
an
oktoberfestmarzen
is
about
a
complex
maltiness
this
beer
has
an
aroma
and
flavor
that
profiles
german
hops
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
drinkable
but
i
there
are
better
beers
for
this
style
i
would
order
and
drink
this
all
day
if
it
was
available
ofests
are
not
my
regular
choice
at
home
but
i
love
to
drink
them
in
the
fall
to
bring
in
the
october
spirit
drinkability
decent
but
not
great
its
definitely
nice
on
a
cool
autumn
day
but
not
as
food
friendly
as
i
had
hoped
while
the
malts
and
hops
were
nice
in
and
of
themselves
i
didnt
feel
they
were
blended
as
perfectly
as
they
could
have
been
md
very
drinkable
and
an
easy
session
beer
the
mouth
is
full
and
rich
but
not
overwhelming
drinks
very
well
as
my
friend
said
i
would
love
a
stein
of
this
to
quaff
very
nice
burnt
golden
color
the
smell
is
not
the
best
it
had
a
bit
of
that
sulfer
skunk
that
alot
of
import
german
lagers
seem
to
get
along
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
background
the
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
carmel
in
front
and
a
nice
roasty
backend
finishes
very
nice
and
clean
not
my
favorite
marzen
but
not
bad
d
i
rate
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
as
high
its
still
a
great
standard
beer
to
have
around
in
septemberoctober
burnt
orange
with
a
pillowy
alabaster
crown
of
foam
collapses
leaving
average
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
rich
of
toasted
malt
and
some
strange
faint
vegetal
notes
of
brussels
sprouts
from
the
weak
hops
malt
flavors
range
from
fresh
toasted
grain
to
crusty
bready
tones
with
caramel
and
enough
hops
to
balance
goes
dry
towards
the
end
with
a
soft
working
the
nice
balance
and
depth
of
this
lager
is
wonderful
but
not
quite
the
benchmark
for
its
style
drinkable
but
unremarkable
i
like
the
style
but
i
think
id
go
elsewhere
if
i
wanted
an
oktoberfest
beer
simply
based
on
how
light
everything
is
here
d
good
german
brew
but
does
not
stand
apart
from
standard
beers
not
labled
for
oktoberfest
poured
a
orange
and
amber
color
with
a
modest
white
head
nose
is
mainly
grainy
and
skunky
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malts
caramel
malts
with
a
mildly
bitter
amount
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
average
not
the
best
oktoberfest
brew
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
as
it
is
fairly
light
in
flavor
and
not
terribly
high
in
alcohol
i
prefer
more
flavor
from
my
marzens
however
bigger
malt
and
hop
profiles
would
do
wonders
for
this
one
notes
not
the
best
for
the
style
and
also
not
the
worst
it
is
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
awaybut
it
barely
reaches
that
decent
stage
drinkability
again
i
liked
this
it
is
what
it
is
but
as
a
refreshing
alternative
this
worked
for
me
d
not
bad
but
its
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
slightly
clouded
muted
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
dense
off
white
foam
no
lacing
to
mention
with
this
one
aromas
and
flavors
of
bread
mild
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
caramel
green
apples
and
grass
are
detected
seems
a
tad
thin
bodied
with
almost
ample
carbonation
ill
stick
with
the
domestic
marzens
for
the
most
part
drinkability
ill
admit
i
was
taken
aback
by
how
surprisingly
bland
and
hohum
this
one
was
being
spaten
is
one
of
the
propagators
of
this
noble
style
im
simply
left
wanting
more
any
malt
depth
and
complexity
and
even
just
a
tiny
bump
in
overall
body
to
keep
that
nagging
though
of
drinking
brown
water
away
perhaps
ill
give
this
one
a
revisit
sometime
down
the
road
so
i
can
hopefully
put
this
disheartening
experience
behind
me
despite
its
failings
i
could
definitely
have
more
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
is
very
flavorful
and
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
i
will
have
again
another
great
beer
from
spaten
pours
a
brownish
colored
body
with
a
small
white
colored
head
very
creamy
looking
has
a
very
malty
aroma
some
acidity
in
the
palate
sourish
taste
almost
dusty
malty
taste
dont
know
if
the
acidity
and
sour
are
a
bad
sign
or
not
verdict
certainly
not
the
most
complex
beer
ever
but
its
got
enough
going
on
to
merit
drinking
on
its
own
rather
than
just
using
it
to
wash
down
some
brats
a
good
brew
not
super
great
but
still
a
descent
food
beer
had
some
wings
with
it
went
well
md
very
easydrinking
lightly
carbonated
and
surprisingly
lightbodied
for
a
5
9abv
brew
but
somehow
the
maltiness
on
the
flavour
is
slightly
in
the
lacking
that
reduces
the
overall
performance
for
the
hops
are
too
mild
and
the
yeasty
sour
touch
is
subdued
an
ok
beer
designed
to
quaff
in
the
famous
festival
but
i
suspect
the
draught
version
has
to
be
much
more
delicious
to
be
able
to
keep
people
on
their
benches
under
those
huge
marquees
but
i
hear
one
cant
simply
move
to
any
other
marquee
without
a
prior
booking
nowadays
oh
well
a
pub
crawl
is
so
much
more
fun
innit
a
cheap
beer
with
historical
significance
and
import
intrigue
but
falls
a
little
flat
on
aroma
and
flavorpretty
big
areas
by
way
of
disclaimer
i
dont
have
any
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
so
i
cannot
compare
this
particular
one
to
the
best
of
the
breed
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
worthwhile
but
nothing
to
jump
up
and
down
about
not
a
first
choice
off
the
shelf
for
me
there
seem
to
be
lots
of
these
12pack
available
four
months
past
october
but
the
beer
is
still
very
good
d
not
the
best
beer
but
very
drinkable
especially
during
oktoberfest
taste
a
sweet
malty
flavor
in
the
beginning
that
fades
into
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
poured
from
the
tap
at
responsible
beer
bar
that
likey
takes
care
of
their
lines
and
taps
golden
copper
color
with
a
big
white
head
clean
and
crisp
flavor
and
with
a
delicate
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
noble
hops
light
enough
to
enjoy
multiple
glasses
without
filling
up
a
real
fest
beer
with
aromatic
hops
good
flavor
and
easy
to
enjoy
a
solid
beer
something
to
have
again
d
good
beer
and
one
for
the
masses
with
nice
fresh
flavours
subtle
sweetness
and
a
good
look
d
this
one
is
very
easily
drinkable
not
complex
or
overly
subtle
though
refreshing
and
tasty
a
little
complexity
in
flavor
decent
nose
good
feel
and
pretty
solid
drinkability
it
has
a
heartiness
but
still
light
aftertaste
that
lingers
but
does
not
overwhelm
overall
a
really
solid
quaff
d
overall
moderate
per
style
moderate
flavor
and
moderate
drinkability
d
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
as
it
feels
somewhat
thin
and
yet
too
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
very
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
one
again
glad
i
got
to
review
it
though

a
solid
offering
but
nothing
to
raise
your
eyebrows
ambergold
pour
with
a
big
white
head
perfumelike
aroma
with
light
bavarian
malts
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
good
balance
of
spicypeppery
hops
bready
and
sweet
flavors
as
well
subtle
mouthfeel
a
clean
smooth
not
overwhelming
beer
not
only
that
a
marzen
that
i
actually
like
drinkability
pretty
good
not
the
oktoberfest
that
i
would
reach
for
maybe
it
could
be
the
green
bottle
i
recommend
that
residents
of
the
u
s
a
who
like
malty
sweetish
and
fresh
oktoberfest
beer
should
stick
to
a
domestic
example
im
fond
of
samuel
adams
which
is
also
easy
to
find
here
in
lexington
ky
spatens
oktoberfest
on
the
other
hand
might
be
delicious
from
a
fresh
keg
in
munich
in
case
somebody
wants
to
fly
me
there
although
it
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
im
still
going
to
purchase
this
and
other
spaten
products
again
overall
nothing
special
doesnt
really
excite
the
palate
high
drink
ability
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
oktoberfest
beer
overall
there
is
a
skunky
but
there
is
malt
is
slightly
complex
md
im
not
really
that
into
this
beer
a
bit
to
much
carbonation
to
be
drinkable
and
not
that
much
flavor
to
speak
of
anyway
one
of
my
favorite
tasting
beers
it
looks
unlike
most
other
oktoberfests
ive
tried
with
a
lighter
color
but
it
still
retains
a
decent
head
it
smells
very
sweet
with
an
almost
fruity
candy
smell
to
it
spaten
oktoberfest
was
the
first
oktoberfesta
nd
you
can
dell
it
in
the
taste
it
makes
all
other
oktoberfests
pale
in
comparison
clearly
showing
everything
else
is
an
imitation
sweet
malty
taste
it
really
embodies
the
fall
in
my
mind
mouthfeel
is
decent
much
like
most
ales
drinkability
is
average
seeing
as
how
it
is
so
sweet
it
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
every
time
fall
comes
around
i
will
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
this
wonderful
brew
d
very
good
for
the
style
d
drinkable
but
definitely
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
other
oktoberfest
beers
d
good
octoberfest
i
usually
dont
like
the
style
but
i
would
recommend
trying
it
picked
this
beer
up
during
oktoberfest
08
pours
a
lovely
dark
ambercaramel
colour
very
little
head
after
the
initial
pour
very
thin
lacing
thereafter
quite
a
powerful
hoppy
almost
breadlike
smell
that
is
fairly
pleasant
taste
ranks
highly
alongside
the
look
of
this
beer
a
nice
full
beer
flavour
with
some
notes
of
yeast
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
crisp
on
the
tongue
due
to
a
strong
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
but
should
be
consumed
at
an
easygoing
pace
as
it
seemed
to
blow
the
head
off
me
very
quickly
definitely
a
beer
for
fans
of
a
good
strong
tasting
beer
not
very
drinkable
really
i
had
trouble
raching
for
this
the
last
of
the
three
i
had
there
are
just
far
better
representatives
of
the
style
out
there
this
oktoberfest
was
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
great
if
its
there
ill
have
one
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
drinkability
here
is
decent
not
the
best
oktoberfestbier
ive
had
this
year
but
for
the
price
itll
do
great
with
wings
average
beer
fairly
drinkable
served
at
cellar
temps
in
14
oz
pint
glass
poured
a
bright
amber
with
tight
longlasting
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
a
full
malt
aroma
this
lager
began
sweet
and
smooth
the
body
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
the
finish
dried
out
a
bit
but
the
sweet
malts
had
the
last
say
perhaps
a
bit
unbalanced
for
the
style
more
akin
to
a
lighter
bock
bier
this
is
still
a
decent
quaffing
beer
but
i
think
this
oktoberfest
has
been
dumbed
down
for
the
mass
beer
market
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
either
would
definitely
drink
again
ok
ofest
i
guess
just
not
what
i
prefer
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
id
probably
skip
this
next
time
around
decent
carbonation
matches
the
brew
well
and
yields
a
moderate
body
with
a
pleasant
toasted
malt
close
that
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
isnt
overly
sweet
for
the
style
yet
offers
enough
malt
structure
to
give
it
some
body
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
other
beers
of
the
style
picked
up
a
12
pack
to
share
with
some
friends
recently
poured
into
a
pint
glass
brownish
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
somewhat
flat
looking
not
much
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
was
a
bit
earthy
taste
was
a
bit
sub
par
way
too
much
malt
to
the
point
of
sticking
to
the
palate
plus
there
was
an
skunked
flavor
hidden
after
the
swallow
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
smooth
going
down
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
the
taste
kind
of
a
let
down
from
a
from
a
brewer
thats
had
a
bit
of
time
to
work
on
the
ofest
recipe
not
bad
comparing
to
the
style
not
a
bad
choice
when
fall
rolls
around
given
the
brewers
history
pretty
solid
choice
d
average
at
best
not
a
session
beer
but
adequate
for
serving
with
a
hot
spicy
pizza
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
and
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
fill
your
huge
glass
stein
and
go
for
it
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
it
had
a
little
orange
zest
added
to
the
rounded
wheat
character
caramel
malts
were
present
but
definately
blended
in
with
the
other
flavors
the
wheat
notes
were
present
but
didnt
overpower
like
a
lot
of
beers
of
this
type
t
malt
greats
the
mouth
and
a
small
spice
flavor
finishes
out
the
taste
for
an
overall
great
mouthfeel
d
outstanding
oktoberfest
quite
underrated
in
my
modest
opinion
highly
enjoyable
and
sessionable
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
for
this
octoberfest
season
for
a
little
context
even
though
its
available
year
round
i
wait
till
the
first
weekend
of
fall
every
year
and
go
to
town
on
this
beer
definately
one
of
my
favorites
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
in
terms
of
easydrinking
crowdpleasing
octoberfest
this
stuff
goes
down
my
throat
like
silk
its
flavorful
but
very
drinkable
tastes
like
a
festival
in
a
bottle
what
a
beautiful
creamy
malty
finish
this
beer
has
its
got
a
good
kick
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
more
with
each
passing
sip
i
consider
this
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
it
seemed
a
bit
different
than
the
other
marzens
that
i
had
this
year
the
lite
front
end
makes
this
a
beer
that
you
really
want
to
get
a
mouthful
of
i
wish
there
was
more
malt
in
the
taste
however
all
in
all
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
lacking
any
real
flavor
to
make
it
stand
out
this
would
be
a
good
starter
ofest
beer
for
friends
that
you
are
trying
to
introduce
to
something
beyond
bmc
one
and
done
for
me
ill
stick
to
their
excellent
hefes
i
just
got
into
octoberfest
this
year
for
the
first
time
some
of
these
season
beers
are
pretty
damn
good
spatens
variation
is
definately
in
that
category
nice
orangey
dark
amber
it
poured
three
inches
of
slightly
off
white
head
which
dropped
to
a
ring
but
hung
around
the
whole
time
decent
lacing
tasted
good
it
had
a
good
amount
of
standard
sweet
toasted
malt
to
it
but
there
were
some
interesting
grassy
notes
in
there
as
well
i
could
drink
these
all
night
notes
overall
it
was
not
bad
but
nothing
like
the
lighter
spaten
oktoberfest
that
i
remember
which
was
very
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
would
probably
be
fine
on
tap
in
germany
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
a
burnt
orange
with
brown
tint
a
light
head
clings
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
spice
it
lost
some
points
due
to
slight
skunk
this
is
an
ok
oktoberfest
offering
and
i
will
be
enjoying
many
this
evening
not
the
worst
or
the
best
overall
this
is
a
fine
tasting
brew
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
put
a
few
litres
of
this
away
on
a
fine
fall
afternoon
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
i
have
had
this
year
also
had
sam
adams
blue
moons
harvest
moon
and
bluegrass
brewing
co
oktoberfest
that
evening
all
were
good
this
was
3
of
3
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
fresh
grain
taste
is
biscuity
sweet
full
bodied
with
a
hint
of
hops
to
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
full
medium
carbonation
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
good
solid
marzen
i
wish
they
would
switch
from
the
green
bottle
though
i
thought
i
detected
a
hint
of
skunkyness
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
ofest
tasty
but
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
i
may
try
it
on
tap
and
see
if
my
impression
changes
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
appetizing
dark
amber
brown
with
a
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
rich
crisp
and
malty
somewhat
like
a
typical
lager
but
a
little
fuller
flavor
is
mouthfilling
crisp
and
malty
texture
is
smooth
finish
is
pleasant
and
mild
and
has
a
hint
of
hops
there
are
other
better
ones
out
this
october
poured
a
copper
even
close
to
light
brown
body
with
good
head
retention
and
decent
lacings
decent
malt
smell
although
i
couldnt
really
pick
up
anything
that
discernible
malts
are
in
the
taste
but
unfortunately
this
beer
has
a
really
drying
sensation
to
it
so
while
it
has
sweetness
and
some
spiciness
to
it
it
also
seems
offbalance
and
not
a
sessionable
not
a
terrible
beer
at
all
but
for
an
oktoberfest
you
can
easily
do
better
pours
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
and
decent
lacing
some
carbonation
aroma
of
hops
very
slightly
skunky
and
malts
with
a
strong
hops
finish
malty
and
hop
balance
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
dark
amber
hue
with
inch
high
head
that
looks
quite
enticing
but
dont
let
looks
fool
you
aroma
of
grains
spice
and
vegetable
oil
taste
is
quite
bland
just
grains
and
vegetable
flavors
with
slight
spice
to
end
the
drink
no
real
personality
to
speak
of
and
no
richness
that
stands
out
pass
over
this
one
if
possible
drinkability
good
beer
for
the
season
a
very
nice
warmer
on
a
cool
evening
this
beer
covered
all
the
bases
of
a
ofest
with
out
anything
spectacular
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
strange
in
the
finish
for
me
good
to
try
one
of
the
six
big
oktoberfestbiers
i
suppose
and
the
alcohol
is
reasonable
but
still
definitely
not
my
favorite
notes
the
best
oktoberfest
and
why
not
from
munich
and
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
real
oktoberfest
i
have
had
it
will
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
surpass
its
wonderful
balance
simplicity
drinkability
bravo
mediumbodied
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
crisp
to
the
palate
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
its
not
a
bad
beer
has
some
decent
flavor
to
it
just
not
really
a
great
oktoberfest
drinkability
not
to
repeat
myself
but
i
think
that
i
put
it
best
a
moment
ago
isnt
spectacular
but
theres
much
worse
out
there
this
is
an
ok
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
light
clean
taste
that
is
not
impossible
to
enjoy
personally
i
like
oktoberfest
beers
with
a
little
more
flavor
but
if
you
like
a
more
suttle
one
then
you
may
want
to
check
this
one
out
spaten
oktoberfest
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
decent
lacing
in
the
glass
as
well
smell
was
light
of
malt
and
hops
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
hops
were
only
slightly
present
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
sticky
dirnkability
was
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
i
found
this
to
be
the
sweetest
of
the
german
brewed
ofests
sweeter
then
paulener
and
hackerpschorr
still
a
nice
beer
one
i
will
buy
again
as
i
am
a
fan
of
all
the
munich
brewed
ofests
this
beer
would
be
pretty
easy
to
pound
good
drinkability
d
something
about
this
beer
strikes
me
as
odd
perhaps
what
i
got
from
the
taste
in
general
isnt
what
i
thought
the
relatively
abundant
hop
presence
with
the
burnt
malt
flavors
really
makes
for
a
strange
flavor
glad
i
waited
until
i
saw
a
single
of
this
rather
than
springing
for
a
six
or
twelve
pack
taste
was
a
little
bland
and
mellow
for
an
oktoberfest
there
was
a
weird
finish
that
left
a
tangy
aftertaste
otherwise
the
malt
and
hops
were
fairly
balanced
this
was
drinkable
if
there
wasnt
any
other
option
but
i
would
pass
for
better
seasonals
in
the
future
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
lighter
and
sweeter
oktoberfests
and
it
isnt
too
bad
this
is
the
only
marzen
i
know
of
that
is
on
sale
year
round
i
remember
liking
this
much
more
when
i
first
tried
it
but
this
time
im
not
as
impressed
d
pretty
solid
for
the
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
solid
octy
this
is
one
you
can
hang
your
hat
on
with
gusto
deep
amber
pour
almost
mahogany
with
a
frothy
ivory
head
good
spiced
malt
aroma
which
moves
nicely
into
the
quaff
well
balanced
but
the
finish
has
the
near
perfect
spiced
tasty
taste
good
stuff
this
is
one
to
drink
many
of
in
the
crisp
fall
weather
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
fluffy
singlefinger
head
the
scent
is
pretty
tight
im
only
picking
up
a
little
malt
and
maybe
some
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
caramel
malts
that
gives
away
to
a
tiny
bit
of
malts
and
a
pretty
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
the
carbonation
makes
for
a
nice
crispness
this
is
a
very
tasty
marzen
nice
and
sweet
not
a
bad
way
to
celebrate
oktoberfest
the
taste
is
quite
good
and
mostly
typical
for
the
style
first
there
is
very
little
carbonation
to
this
beer
and
there
is
a
definite
crispness
and
lack
of
smooth
creaminess
both
characteristic
for
the
style
there
are
lots
of
husky
grains
there
is
a
herbal
hop
presence
lots
of
caramel
malts
towards
the
finish
things
get
a
bit
more
interesting
in
that
there
is
a
spicy
bite
a
toasted
and
somewhat
charred
character
and
there
is
a
spice
in
the
end
the
beer
is
fairly
watery
although
not
entirely
light
bodied
the
aftertaste
is
the
lingering
herbal
hops
and
the
spice
in
the
finish
d
this
one
tastes
fine
but
its
nothing
spectacular
the
surprisingly
tealike
flavor
certainly
doesnt
make
it
too
sessionable
d
i
really
like
this
ofest
its
one
i
will
definitely
have
again
the
smell
falls
a
bit
short
but
everything
else
about
it
is
above
averagegood
and
its
very
light
and
drinkable
overall
not
bad
just
a
bit
underwhelming
flavors
are
richer
and
heavier
than
i
would
have
expected
though
ive
admitedly
had
few
enough
oktoberfest
beers
to
compare
it
to
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
for
the
style
well
its
almost
the
same
as
ontap
the
flavor
seems
like
it
might
have
been
slightly
more
rich
ontap
for
some
reason
the
bottled
version
almost
seems
like
it
is
slightly
more
harsh
on
the
finish
still
its
a
very
good
oktoberfest
nicely
drinkable
and
very
wellbalanced
i
only
wish
i
could
enjoy
a
liter
of
it
in
a
maßkrug
amongst
my
deutsche
brüder
one
day
drinkability
definitely
not
as
smooth
as
a
lighter
maerzen
but
still
decent
and
with
its
5
9
abv
this
would
be
mean
fun
times
in
litre
tankards
at
a
bierhall
but
otherwise
im
glad
i
didnt
get
a
whole
sixpack
finishing
clean
this
is
a
light
crisp
and
refreshing
oktoberfest
maybe
not
a
standout
but
eminently
drinkable
this
poured
a
clear
black
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
apple
cider
and
barley
malt
with
a
bit
of
lemony
yeast
it
tasted
like
sweet
apples
mixed
with
cultured
yeast
and
copper
hops
with
a
pecan
or
hazel
nut
malt
it
was
watery
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
light
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
seemed
unique
to
me
for
an
oktoberfest
it
had
a
clean
and
drinkable
flavor
but
it
wasnt
quite
my
taste
i
was
hoping
for
something
maltier
i
highly
suggest
this
one
d
this
was
very
easy
to
take
down
and
the
dry
finish
kept
me
wanting
more
this
is
definitely
a
lot
different
than
the
styles
i
have
had
here
in
the
us
d
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
drank
several
of
these
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
was
not
overpowered
by
them
d
not
bad
the
bitterness
throws
me
off
a
bit
o
fairly
drinkable
but
its
pretty
average
tasting
for
a
marzen
so
not
the
best
session
beer
when
considering
the
abv
d
this
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
represents
the
modern
pale
oktoberfestbiers
in
a
good
way
although
i
like
their
premium
lager
more
the
taste
is
similar
caramelly
toasted
grain
and
bread
leaves
hints
of
herbs
pine
and
stewed
apples
and
a
nuttyleafy
bitterness
just
dominating
the
finish
and
balancing
the
sweetness
the
body
is
a
little
thin
compared
to
some
but
the
flavour
is
nice
with
some
complexity
and
its
tingly
lively
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
id
say
its
not
bad
but
its
certainly
not
great
its
a
good
bit
cheaper
than
some
other
imports
ive
recently
tried
but
you
definitely
get
what
you
pay
for
also
im
really
on
the
fence
as
to
whether
this
review
is
both
fair
and
applicable
as
the
beer
might
be
skunked
as
its
certainly
not
what
i
expected
in
terms
of
taste
when
i
bought
it
green
bottle
instore
fluorescent
lighting
bad
combo
d
now
this
is
a
fest
beer
wish
it
came
in
a
brown
bottle
dperfect
indian
summer
refresher
d
pretty
drinkable
as
the
malts
blended
well
together
and
the
hops
werent
overpowering
overall
this
is
not
the
traditional
oktoberfest
i
expected
from
spaten
but
i
didnt
mind
the
slight
variation
on
the
theme
the
aroma
is
malty
and
grainy
but
generally
faint
theres
a
bit
of
caramel
as
it
warms
the
flavor
follows
suit
grainy
dryness
gradually
becomes
more
sweet
at
warmer
temperatures
faintly
caramelly
but
not
overly
rich
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
husky
lightbodied
amply
carbonated
decent
stuff
here
but
its
lacking
something
namely
personality
i
can
imagine
this
will
appeal
to
people
looking
for
an
octoberfest
with
optimal
blandess
though
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
and
golden
with
2
cm
white
bubbly
head
that
is
quickly
diminishing
aroma
of
a
balance
between
hops
and
malts
although
no
particular
aromas
initial
flavor
has
a
bitter
bite
similar
to
heine
flavor
balances
out
at
the
end
with
some
malts
and
eventually
over
taken
with
sweet
malt
medium
body
light
carbonation
limited
alcohol
limited
lacing
overall
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
d
a
change
of
pace
from
a
helles
lager
and
of
course
a
tradition
for
the
fest
bier
mf
d
crisp
with
tight
carbonation
medium
body
and
a
cereal
feeling
another
great
oktoberfest
dability
think
id
take
a
pilsner
over
this
one
as
a
bitter
finishing
lager
not
enough
malt
character
up
front
to
make
the
aroma
or
flavor
all
that
interesting
clean
and
easy
to
down
a
few
but
not
exciting
something
must
have
gone
haywire
when
this
thing
went
yearround
i
cant
tell
if
this
was
an
old
bottle
or
if
spatens
oktoberfest
just
didnt
hold
up
like
it
used
to
in
my
mind
id
have
to
skip
this
one
in
the
future
di
actually
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
its
a
unique
take
on
an
oktoberfest
pours
a
light
orange
with
fairly
fast
fading
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
the
munich
malts
are
here
but
are
dominated
by
an
imported
grain
scent
taste
sweet
upfront
with
bready
malts
and
again
an
imported
pilslike
grain
component
and
spicy
hops
medium
bodied
finish
is
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
towards
the
bottom
of
the
octoberfest
list
for
me
drinkability
is
moderate
flavor
is
subpar
for
an
oktoberfest
but
its
not
horrible
and
it
is
certainly
sessionable
taste
strong
skunky
flavor
took
a
while
to
get
beyond
the
skunky
flavor
eventually
got
some
bitter
hops
and
caramel
flavor
very
delicious
once
i
got
past
the
skunk
flavor
i
think
spaten
might
want
to
consider
using
brown
bottles
apparently
spaten
turns
a
little
bad
in
the
time
it
takes
to
get
it
to
america
nice
stuff
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
when
it
comes
to
oktoberfest
beer
kind
of
bland
and
almost
skunky
i
have
had
this
several
times
and
every
time
it
seems
like
a
bad
euro
import
the
journey
from
munich
never
seems
to
be
kind
to
this
beer
taste
is
sticky
heavy
on
the
malts
few
hops
spice
grain
end
is
thick
and
just
a
touch
bitter
with
a
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
pours
a
nice
light
amber
very
clear
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
malty
but
clearly
lagery
with
slight
skunk
taste
follows
with
a
good
malty
richness
but
a
little
more
subtle
than
many
lagery
grain
feel
is
there
but
not
overprominent
this
one
is
slightly
skunked
just
slightly
a
nice
flavor
here
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
amazing
a
little
slick
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
this
one
is
very
festival
slammable
a
great
fall
session
brew
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
especially
for
those
who
like
the
caramely
maltiness
toned
down
just
a
touch
good
beer
not
bad
beer
had
a
couple
that
night
probaly
wouldnt
keep
it
on
hand
but
would
buy
it
in
a
multi
pack
to
see
what
others
this
brewery
had
to
offer
d
not
a
bad
drinker
but
also
not
my
first
choice
for
a
good
german
oktoberfest
overall
not
an
overwhelming
beer
but
nuanced
and
elegant
i
wish
for
more
richness
and
intensity
in
the
malt
appearance
is
clear
amberorange
poured
with
two
fingers
of

of

maybe
a
little
bit
of
ginger
snap
restrained

aroma
flavors
of
those
wonderful
german
malts
dominate
from
the
first
pull
and
the
mediumlight

allows
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
in
big
gulps
like
an
oktoberfest
should
be
enjoyed
again
restrained
flowery
noble
hops
in
flavor
and
bitterness
very
smooth
beer
with

finish
is
very
refreshing
pour
me
another
if
youre
dying
for
a
marzen
and
this
is
the
only
thing
available
go
ahead
otherwise
opt
for
brooklyn
sam
adams
or
saranac
not
a
great
representative
of
oktoberfest
and
the
green
bottle
accounts
for
some
but
not
all
of
this
beers
various
flaws
it
should
be
bolder
maltier
and
spicier
and
the
sour
flavor
is
bothersomenot
nearly
what
oktoberfest
should
be
in
my
forays
into
sampling
oktoberfests

that
improved
as
you
drank
more
decent
beer
saw
12packs
of
this
for
a
good
price
at
binnys
yesterday
so
bought
one
on
the
hopes
that
its
the
earliest
and
therefore
freshest
possible
import
shipment
and
not
the
remnants
of
last
year
ive
have
bad
luck
with
import
fest
beer
in
years
past
in
that
regard
no
dates
on
the
package
that
i
can
find
open
the
bottle
ok
its
not
skunky
thats
half
the
battle
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
but
thats
not
the
end
of
the
world
with
lagers
or
this
style
fairly
malty
as
the
style
should
be
head
is
kind
of
fizzy
overall
in
this
state
of
freshness
it
is
tolerable
but
ive
had
better
examples
that
originate
from
the
usa
i
was
expecting
more
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
its
a
fine
beer
light
and
drinkable
which
i
suppose
all
oktoberfests
should
be
but
i
thought
that
there
might
be
a
little
more
substance
to
this
brew
than
is
apparent
here
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
looks
absolutely
great
and
theres
nothing
about
the
taste
that
is
unpleasant
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
m
d
smooth
and
slick
with
a
little
bit
of
body
weight
to
it
a
crisp
carbonation
that
could
potentially
be
a
little
nicer
if
it
was
drier
a
fairly
solid
brew
a
reasonable
selection
to
start
the
season
though
perhaps
not
a
first
choice
on
subsequent
trips

look
at

style
my
2nd
favorite
behind
paulaner
typical
average
german
lager
with
a
decent
touch
of
sweet
malts
and
some
balancing
hops
skunkysweet
aroma
rather
tame
typical
bronze
color
didnt
get
a
very
large
head
but
what
came
about
did
stick
around
filling
on
the
palate
and
crisp
flavor
is
tame
and
different
from
most
other
oktoberfests
decent
example
but
not
grand
by
any
means
d
a
meh
of
a
beer
if
ive
ever
tried
one
not
as
malty
nor
as
fresh
as
i
would
have
liked
and
probably
drinking
this
beer
at
the
wrong
time
of
year
i
imagine
its
much
better
than
this
but
the
bottle
i
have
here
leaves
more
to
be
desired
drinkability
is
easy
mainly
because
theres
not
alot
there
a
disappointment
not
horrific
by
any
means
but
you
can
do
so
much
better
german
or
domestic
mediumbodied
and
disappointing
but
inoffensive
and
pretty
drinkable
d
good
session
beer
that
pairs
well
with
food
not
the
best
oktoberfest
around
but
quite
good
d
very
good
love
me
some
spaten
and
the
oktoberfest
rarely
disappoints
love
this
beer
and
love
this
brewer
but
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
german
beer
moderate
carbonation
and
distinct
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
was
considerable
better
once
the
original
skunk
smell
went
away
the
feel
was
nice
not
watery
like
some
lagers
but
still
goes
down
really
easy
i
would
probably
recommend
something
else
though
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
it
has
a
nice
midrange
amber
color
the
body
was
a
happy
medium
matching
the
flavor
that
was
very
pleasant
it
went
down
smooth
smooth
smooth
will
have
it
when
i
do
a
boot
there
next
time
drinkability
higher
abv
limits
my
intake
but
i
have
taste
for
more
on
tap
at
the
draughthouse
medium
gold
pour
very
little
head
smell
is
some
malt
but
more
yeasty
than
anything
although
somewhat
mildly
so
taste
is
sweet
with
hint
of
hops
and
a
yeasty
lager
like
flavor
decent
very
drinkable
but
nothing
remarkable
overall
a
decent
afterwork
beer
but
nothing
for
a
special
occasion
let
me
start
by
saying
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
copper
in
color
nice
large
white
head
that
held
up
nice
smell
tosted
grains
and
caramel
malts
tast
this
is
where
this
beer
let
me
down
the
caremel
malty
sweetness
just
wasnt
their
this
beer
was
a
little
dry
all
in
all
i
am
glad
to
see
spaten
bring
back
the
amber
color
octoberfest
but
i
still
feel
this
leves
somthing
to
be
desired
ive
had
the
spaten
octoberfest
too
many
times
to
count
over
the
years
i
will
continue
to
pick
it
up
but
and
this
may
be
my
pnw
palate
talking
there
could
be
more
to
this
brew
it
just
seems
like
it
is
bordering
on
great
but
settles
on
adequate
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
is
it
tastes
alot
more
fresh
than
alot
of
the
other
german
octoberfest
brews
that
make
it
to
this
neck
of
the
woods
pours
amber
with
an
inch
head
nice
smell
of
malts
and
spices
it
was
nice
to
have
an
octoberfest
in
february
but
would
prefer
to
have
one
from
great
lakes
old
dominion
or
sam
adams
overall
a
nice
marzen
nice
break
from
my
usual
ipa
or
apa
i
will
look
forward
to
a
marzen
in
september
d
still
a
drinkable
beer
a
color
i
can
only
describe
as
fishy
leads
into
a
nose
of
sawdust
the
flavors
are
woody
and
there
is
a
surprisingly
nice
finish
on
the
palate
fairly
tasty
overally
i
do
have
to
admit
but
its
so
doggone
onedimensional
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
style
thing
or
a
spaten
thing
d
ok
with
some
brats
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
translucent
amber
with
a
rich
offwhite
head
that
only
rises
just
below
an
inch
in
my
glass
i
poured
carefully
the
nose
is
sweet
upfront
baked
green
apples
a
few
raisins
followed
by
a
sturdy
fresh
bread
backbone
first
sip
and
im
pleased
by
the
subtle
sweetness
played
out
over
a
saltinelike
bite
aftertaste
brings
out
some
fruit
notes
back
to
the
apples
in
the
nose
a
little
caramel
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
not
to
thin
not
too
thick
just
hearty
enough
very
enjoyable
all
around
not
a
bad
marzen
this
could
have
used
more
hoppiness
to
balance
out
some
of
the
malt
spaten
makes
some
pretty
fine
german
beers
thoug
even
though
not
their
best
it
is
worth
checking
out
next
october
very
good
beer
for
what
it
is
i
will
for
sure
be
drinking
these
next
year
for
oktoberfest
it
is
really
an
enjoyable
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
my
friends
and
family
will
enjoy
it
when
they
come
to
visit
drinkabilityspaten
makes
a
great
product
this
beer
is
very
polished
at
2
50
a
bottle
id
be
happy
drinking
all
day
long
i
had
about
5
of
these
and
felt
pretty
warm
so
i
encourage
somebody
to
try
more
than
1
to
get
the
full
effect
of
this
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
it
again
after
not
having
had
it
for
a
while
poured
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
nice
color
golden
brown
aromas
of
breads
yeast
tastes
good
light
i
enjoy
the
light
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
i
know
its
not
the
greatest
and
i
have
seen
the
other
comments
degrading
this
brew
but
this
is
brewed
to
be
somewhat
weak
and
drink
all
day
long
at
oktoberfest
overall
a
nice
session
beer
it
pours
a
bronzish
amber
color
in
the
glass
its
topped
off
by
a
big
creamy
looking
head
the
aroma
is
musty
grains
spicy
hop
and
a
whiff
of
malts
the
beer
is
creamy
feeling
easy
drinking
and
decent
tasting
the
maltiness
doesnt
explode
off
the
bat
and
is
held
in
check
by
a
subtle
spicy
hop
flavor
actually
the
latter
starts
to
become
distracting
not
what
i
want
in
an
ofest
its
still
a
decent
beer
though
i
had
mrs
buckspin
confirm
the
nose
her
words
natural
ice
in
a
can
like
most
oktoberfests
that
ive
had
it
is
a
good
beer
after
having
sample
nearly
a
dozen
marzens
and
fests
this
fall
we
would
see
a
massive
shift
away
from
brewers
chruning
out
yellow
fizzy
water
and
see
more
exploration
of
this
style

with

this

had
earlier
this

both
were

quite

there
are
good

and
other

out
there
nothing
bad

with
the

amount
of

to
add
color
and
a

the
taste
is
great
it
isnt
too
plain

there
is
a

here
the

this

some

taste
is
biscuit
light
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hops
hits
all
of
the
expected
marzen
notes
and
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
an
above
average
and
affordable
representation
of
the
style
that
i
would
consider
getting
again
even
though
i
prefer
other
marzens
a
decent
domestic
fest
bier
a
really
good
smooth
octoberfest
tastes
a
lot
like
their
shiner
bock
but
oktoberfest
is
a
better
taste
and
a
better
finish
ill
buy
again
this
beer
was
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
that
i
had
this
year
the
flavor
and
texture
were
just
something
i
looked
forward
to
every
time
i
picked
up
the
glass
to
me
the
only
real
shortcoming
was
that
the
foam
kind
of
gave
up
quickly
instead
of
standing
off
as
i
drank
it
very
good
just
about
my
favorite
beer
kinda
harsh
off
balance
drinkable
though
as
the
bros
say
clean
crisp
and
very
drinkable
on
par
with
sam
adams
octoberfest
better
than
average
but
less
than
a
thomas
hooker
or
otter
creek
octoberfest
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
overall
lacking
in
depth
almost
no
hoppiness
is
also
a
letdown
the
color
is
copper
with
burnt
orange
reflections
it
pours
a
larger
than
normal
frothy
head
for
a
marzenstyle
brew
about
2
fingers
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
shiners
label
states
it
is
best
enjoyed
in
a
stein
so
i
think
ill
try
it
in
that
next
time
nothing
notable
in
the
aroma
which
is
pleasing
fresh
and
has
a
nice
essence
of
malt
the
taste
is
fresh
and
crisp
to
start
but
does
finish
a
bit
steely
and
mildly
bitter
spoetzls
own
marzen
is
a
more
than
solid
reference
to
this
style
of
beer
october
is
almost
gone
but
its
not
too
late
to
get
into
the
ofest
spirit
overall
a
surprisingly
nice
oktoberfest
marzen
that
will
be
in
my
october
lineup
from
now
on
especially
at
a
7
dollar
price
tag
overall
not
much
complexity
in
terms
of
taste
a
pleasant
refreshing
beer
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
an
oktoberfest
very
light
malt
hint
of
breadiness
some
cereal
grain
a
tiny
amount
of
bitterness
its
a
lighter
style
in
a
category
mostly
dominated
by
robust
offerings
oktoberfest
pours
a
bronze
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
caramel
and

aroma
the
taste
is

crisp
full
caramel
flavors
decent
body
and
fell
overall
it
has
some
nice
caramel
flavors
not
bad
overall
at

its
not
a
big
sweet
caramel
bomb
but
its
still
a
macro
like
tasting
lager
unfortunately
o
a
borderline
ok
ofest
not
very
complex
but
still
a
step
up
from
most
macros
definitely
take
it
or
leave
it

overall
3
41
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
offering
from
shiner
its
just
too
much
like
a
stale
bitter
amber
beer
and
doesnt
have
enough
festivities
in
its
profile
to
make
it
a
competitive
marzen
the
finish
leaves
you
with
a
pleasant
truetostyle
flavor
but
the
body
itself
is
pretty
poor
id
skip
this
one
and
try
a
different
oktoberfest
an
agreeable
enough
version
of
the
style
and
a
folksy
ode
to
the
brewerys
historical
roots
not
sure
how
this
works
in
the
relative
heat
of
the
central
texas
autumn
but
here
in
nippy
denver
it
simply
hits
the
spot
simple
not
too
carbonated
interesting
flavor
a
lot
more
relaxed
than
many
oktoberfest
beers
pretty
chill
though
i
like
it
its
a
pretty
good
beer
enjoyable
good
amount
of
malt
but
not
overly
maltysweet
whether
it
not
its
a
prototypical
octoberfest
i
cant
say
but
the
6
pack
i
bought
for
a
gathering
disappeared
quickly
overall
surprisingly
tasty
super
easy
to
drink
the
best
shiner
beer
i
have
had
nicely
unpretensious
the
sum
is
greater
than
its
parts
o
too
sweet
for
my
taste
clear
golden
color
decent
white
head
rich
sweet
bready
pilsner
with
a
light
metallic
sharpness
earthy
hop
bite
not
rich
and
malty
enough
for
the
style
i
could
drink
these
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
what
a
big
disappiontment
somebody
told
they
like
this
so
i
had
to
try
it
wow
big
time
bad
and
ok
color
with
a
taste
like
an
old
sock
nothing
more
to
say
but
stay
away
from
this
one
o
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
but
id
put
it
slightly
below
average
for
the
style
the
metallic
finish
was
offouting
as
well
poured
out
a
medium
amber
clear
and
effervescent
a
mildly
creamy
white
head
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
slightly
astringent
the
aroma
is
a
little
less
abrasive
with
some
nice
if
nondescript
malt
notes
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
truly
ok
it
was
a
screwcap
so
no
pop
but
plenty
of
glug
as
i
nearly
upturned
the
bottle
just
to
see
what
would
happen
the
pseudocascade
settled
into
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
amber

my
recommendation
pick
it
up
if
you
come
across
it
but
dont
expect
to
be
knocked
off
your
socks
with
this
one
as
stated
earlier
its
just
a
nice
beer
for
drinking
with
the
fellas
not
one
to
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
slightly
below
average
example
of
the
style
it
seemed
like
it
was
going
the
right
direction
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
it
started
to
go
downhill
and
it
had
some
off
flavors
that
prevented
it
from
being
as
good
and
clean
as
it
could
be
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
clean
crisp
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
one
is
enough
for
me
any
more
than
that
and
i
think
the
off
aspects
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
to
me
that
was
the
aspect
that
was
the
truest
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
just
had
some
off
aspects
that
hurt
it
and
made
it
not
too
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
hard
to
find
better
american
made
oktoberfest
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
for
the
same
reason
all
in
all
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
that
metallic
flavor
was
a
pretty
big
deal
breaker
for
me
its
now
one
of
my
least
favorite
american
made
marzens
and
its
also
now
my
least
favorite
beer
from
shiner
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
needs
some
work
overall
a
solid
oktoberfest
that
is
still
one
of
my
goto
märzens
there
is
a
great
balance
between
the
toasted
malt
flavor
and
bitter
floral
hop
notes
a
nice
clean
finish
to
top
it
all
off
pours
a
copperamber
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
some
decent
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
malts
but
not
real
strong
pretty
much
the
same
with
taste
also
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
not
as
hoppy
as
other
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
had
at
all

a
good
brew

not
a
lot
on
the
nose
other
than
wheat
the
taste
was
disappointing
some
spice
cinnamon
all
spice
not
sure
then
a
not
so
great
still
toasted
bread
in
the
flavor
with
a
bit
more
bitterness
nothing
extraordinary
the
shiner
oktoberfest
beer
was
a
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
tge
aroma
of
the
beer
i
also
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
liked
that
it
had
a
strong
smell
to
it
i
also
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
the
beer
it
had
some
what
of
a
heavy
taste
at
least
to
me
it
did
but
i
liked
and
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
always
liked
shiner
beers
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
marzen
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
very
delicious
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
actually
its
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
that
i
always
get
every
october
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
and
i
really
like
the
citrus
flavors
too
oaverage
oktoberfest
beer
lacks
depth
of
flavor
very
typical
marzen
style
beer
good
typically
rich
color
decent
yellowish
colored
head
it
is
what
it
is
its
another
octoberfest
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
in
truth
i
may
be
getting
enough
of
the
octoberfest
beers
they
are
all
starting
to
be
so
similar
poured
to
a
nice
full
head
with
medium
retention
and
not
much
lacing
had
a
nice
amber
color
clear
with
a
mild
aroma
some
hins
of
malt
and
caramel
in
the
smell
had
a
nice
flavor
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toasted
nuts
nice
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
with
a
cool
lasting
aftertaste
seems
to
be
a
beefed
up
macro
lager
id
be
happy
if
the
macro
lagers
did
taste
like
this
though
as
the
grainy
dms
doesnt
come
through
it
is
still
a
rather
weak
showing
for
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
ample
and
tasty
octoberfest
malty
aromatic
flavorful
with
a
very
nice
marzen
type
body
hops
are
low
but
crispness
is
high
and
overall
drinkability
is
nice
i
could
certainly
drink
plenty
of
these
at
a
nice
fall
festival
or
on
a
saturday
afternoon
good
job
spoetzl
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
that
ive
tried
recently
you
cant
get
this
beer
where
i
live
but
you
can
get
it
here
in
sheridan
wyoming
this
town
has
an
excellent
local
brewery
and
an
awesome
selection
particularly
at
star
liquor
quite
a
welcome
change
from
most
wyoming
towns
where
you
can
get
all
three
brands
of
beer
bud
coors
and
miller
i
like
shiner
bock
quite
a
bit
but
i
dont
consider
it
a
good
beer
the
same
can
be
said
here
as
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
that
its
mostly
easy
to
drink
mostly
there
are
a
lot
of
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
however
a
little
bit
of
work
could
do
wonders
here
o
not
bad
middle
of
the
pack
ofest
overall
a
pretty
poor
example
of
the
style
not
a
good
beer
from
shiner
either
really
one
to
just
avoid
o
ive
consumed
my
fair
share
of
oktoberfest
beers
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
by
no
means
is
this
a
shitty
beer
seems
slightly
underrated
i
really
hate
to
give
a
shiner
product
such
a
low
score
but
this
beer
is
just
awful
i
was
very
disappointed
since
shiner
tend
to
brew
quality
brews
the
beer
pours
a
nice
caramel
color
with
a
hint
of
sugary
malts
and
it
goes
downhill
from
there
the
beer
tastes
very
strange
like
it
is
stale
or
overly
sugared
it
is
sweet
and
pungent
at
the
same
time
it
leaves
a
horrible
dirty
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
and
i
literally
could
get
only
one
person
to
drink
one
in
its
entirety
the
first
time
shiner
has
let
me
down
but
i
am
still
a
fan
nonetheless
just
steer
clear
of
this
bad
brew
overall
is
this
an
oktoberfest
or
a
regular
domestic
american
brew
o
i
think
this
beer
is
way
underrated
here
its
got
the
right
amount
of
caramel
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
it
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
its
easy
drinking
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
shiner
o
this
thing
went
downhill
from
the
appearance
to
the
smell
to
the
taste
i
was
disappointed
since
i
like
shiners
bock
and
farmers
ale
and
since
oktoberfests
is
a
genre
i
really
enjoy
each
fall
o
this
beer
has
some
characteristics
of
german
märzens
but
seems
a
little
lighter
in
body
honestly
this
oktoberfest
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
if
you
are
like
me
and
not
at
all
impressed
by
shiner
this
still
may
be
worth
a
try
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
if
you
are
in
houston
i
like
the
karbach
karbachtoberfest
better
and
saint
arnold
about
the
same
eh
not
awful
but
not
something
ill
be
likely
to
revisit
a
couple
weird
offflavors
keep
this
one
from
being
a
solid
oktoberfest
definitely
many
better
options
out
there

after

overall
this
is

very

i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
shiners
oktoberfest
pours
out
orange
with
a
head
that
leaves
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
richly
malty
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
nice
approachable
yet
full
malty
flavor
its
pretty
mellow
compared
to
most
american
interpretations
of
the
style
but
its
really
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
velvety
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
solid
oktoberfest
that
seems
a
bit
underrated
here
overall
more
complex
malt
character
than
anticipated
from
shiner
not
on
par
with
the
top
examples
but
a
decent
brew
cheers
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
seasonal
from
spoetzel
says
it
is
a
marzen
style
oktoberfest
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
dry
hoppy
smell
with
a
hint
of
metallic
clove
pours
to
a
light
bronze
color
with
a
pillowy
clingy
and
robust
tan
colored
head
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
sweet
up
front
with
a
slightly
bitter
metallic
bitterness
that
lingers
to
a
fading
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
has
a
moment
where
it
is
watery
in
the
middle
but
overall
it
is
a
nonfactor
head
has
excellent
staying
power
i
usually
steer
away
from
oktoberfests
due
to
being
overly
sweet
but
spoetzel
has
put
enough
bitter
hopping
in
this
beer
to
make
it
tasty
i
would
drink
again
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
overall
love
love
love
the
unique
color
i
like
that
it
has
a
similar
flavor
profile
to
darker
beer
but
i
can
drink
several
without
feeling
like
i
ate
a
full
turkey
dinner
with
all
the
trimmings
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
respectable
khaki
head
aroma
smells
of
clean
floral
hops
and
mild
caramel
sweetness
a
trace
amount
of
skunkiness
may
be
present
as
well
but
not
obnoxiously
so
flavor
is
noticeably
milder
than
the
aroma
and
the
aroma
wasnt
especially
bold
to
begin
with
i
would
assume
im
tasting
some
caramel
malt
and
mild
hops
but
its
so
vague
that
it
would
be
hard
to
surmise
without
having
seen
and
smelled
it
before
drinking
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
recedes
which
is
respectable
carbonation
lends
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
would
be
just
right
if
only
there
were
a
bit
more
substance
to
offset
it
as
is
it
feels
slightly
too
thin
and
watery
this
beer
might
really
have
something
going
for
it
if
only
it
had
more
flavor
and
body
without
it
remains
a
safe
sessionable
beer
with
naught
to
write
home
about
overall
drinkability
i
cant
say
that
shiner
has
ever
disappointed
me
i
will
look
for
some
more
beers
from
them
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
from
shiner
rjt
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
not
something
worth
raving
about
but
respectable
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
very
easy
drinking
and
flows
around
the
palate
nicely
spoetzl
brewing
did
a
good
job
on
this
beer
a
good
take
on
a
classic
german
style
but
ive
had
better
glad
it
wasnt
the
hot
mess
that
shiner
bock
was
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
semitransparent
light
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
some
light
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malt
but
nothing
too
strong
tastes
of
very
slight
fruity
taste
with
the
dark
roasted
malt
quite
inviting
light
bodied
beer
with
perfect
carbonation
definitely
a
nice
session
beer
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
plain
and
overall
average
beer
its
good
for
the
money
but
id
rather
spend
an
extra
buck
and
get
sa
oktoberfest
while
i
wish
they
would
not
purify
their
beers
like
the
big
boys
shiner
definitely
puts
out
some
stuff
better
and
more
adventurous
than
the
big
boys
though
they
arent
one
of
the
small
boys
shiner
needs
to
quit
being
so
wimpy
and
start
putting
out
some
beer
with
some
flavor
they
ought
to
rename
themselves
the
let
down
brewery
this
beer
tastes
cheap
and
crappy
its
better
than
malt
liquor
but
so
is
mud
with
bugs
in
it
holy
cow
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
shiner
beers
ive
been
to
the
brewery
and
to
shiner
pop
2000
and
have
family
there
but
i
have
to
be
honest
i
did
not
expect
much
from
this
beer
considering
some
of
the
other
seasonals
theyve
produced
and
considering
the
general
quality
of
american
oktoberfests
but
wow
this
is
a
tribute
to
the
brewmaster
he
or
she
nailed
it
this
is
at
heart
a
restrained
beer
but
at
heart
this
is
a
restrained
style
it
is
meant
to
be
rich
and
flavorful
but
light
fairly
dry
and
supremely
drinkable
this
beer
lots
of
rich
malt
no
caramel
or
cloying
sweetness
no
hops
just
a
clean
malty
lager
the
way
the
good
lord
and
king
ludwig
of
bavaria
intended
if
i
were
you
dear
reader
id
pick
up
a
bottle
of
shiner
oktoberfest
appreciate
shiners
aboveaverage
interpretation
of
the
märzen
style
appreciate
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
produced
by
a
brewery
that
produces
undrinkable
beers
e
g
shiner
light
blonde
thank
your
lucky
stars
for
the
cheap
price
if
you
live
in
texas
but
do
not
confuse
this
beer
with
superior
offerings
in
the
style
d
excellent
appearance
but
average
in
all
other
facets
the
end
results
is
a
respectable
marzen
which
i
would
gladly
drink
again
but
not
necessarily
seek
out
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
oktoberfest
beers
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
an
inexpensive
good
oktoberfest
beer
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
better
german
examples
but
if
youre
on
a
budget
this
could
work
shiner
products
are
not
known
for
their
amazing
memorable
flavor
and
shiner
oktoberfest
is
no
different
however
it
is
better
tasting
and
fuller
bodied
than
other
shiner
beer
and
its
crisp
highly
drinkable
personality
make
it
a
good
choice
when
you
want
the
taste
of
marzen
but
want
something
a
little
easier
on
the
palate
decent
beer
though
good
session
beer
good
for
a
drunken
oktoberfest
session
anyway
which
is
what
its
for
shiners
rendition
is
flat
on
flavor
and
bruising
with
husky
astringencies
too
dry
too
bitter
and
too
hunky
subpar
finish
kills
the
desire
to
take
another
sip
a
blunder
of
a
lager
2
5
i
think
this
has
to
be
my
favorate
us
made
oktoberfest
not
shabby
but
not
great
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
it
mises
the
mark
as
a
traditional
oktoberfest
its
overly
bready
and
a
bit
sweet
it
was
good
once
but
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
malt
profile
is
typical
märzen
bringing
some
nice
breadiness
and
mild
sweetness
to
the
tongue
the
hops
are
present
there
in
there
with
some
spiciness
floral
and
earthy
qualities
theres
that
nice
back
end
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
clings
to
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
knock
back
this
is
one
of
shiners
better
offerings
and
could
easily
fit
as
one
of
their
year
round
offerings
rather
than
just
a
seasonal
o
a
solid
oktoberfest
for
sure
this
brings
the
mouthfeel
and
roasted
bready
elements
know
in
marzens
subtle
bitterness
rounds
out
the
sweet
malts
one
i
will
try
again
over
all
a
surprisingly
drinkable
marzen
and
actually
the
first
beer
ive
tried
spoetzl
brewery
it
has
a
caramelish
sweetness
a
touch
of
toast
and
mild
hops
and
fits
the
style
well
enough
doesnt
rank
with
the
major
bavarians
but
is
easily
drinkable
and
inoffensive
worth
trying
o
not
really
a
fan
of
this
beer
not
enough
malt
flavor
and
too
watery
extremely
clean
and
very
drinkable
just
as
smooth
as
it
is
crisp
well
balanced
from
malt
sweetness
to
toasted
flavors
to
bittering
hops
a
happy
brew
to
knock
back
o
its
an
adequate
beer
i
used
to
love
this
style
and
this
time
of
year
when
they
were
released
then
i
found
better
styles
from
shiner
i
find
most
shiner
offerings
to
be
drinkable
and
lighter
on
the
palate
and
this
one
is
no
exception
12
oz
bottle
pours
light
amber
with
a
thick
long
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
cookie
dough
and
some
noble
hops
body
is
medium
and
tangy
caramel
malt
is
trying
to
balance
herbal
leafy
hops
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
hoppy
the
brew
is
a
little
bit
too
hoppy
for
marzen
although
im
not
a
fan
of
sheiner
i
liked
this
beer
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
will
be
the
only
six
pack
i
enjoy
of
this
as
there
are
far
too
many
others
to
enjoy
but
i
like
this
a
fair
little
beer
too
bad
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
potential
hinted
at
with
the
appearance
and
smell
but
still
a
decent
fall
thirst
quencher
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
3
finger
head
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
head
constantly
the
smell
was
of
adjunct
and
spice
an
odd
mixture
but
definitely
there
the
taste
was
of
slight
adjunct
with
some
spices
perhaps
some
cinnamon
and
lightly
toasted
malt
very
very
drinkable
without
being
overpowered
the
mouthfeel
is
virtually
the
same
a
stronger
adjunct
coming
through
but
its
still
very
manageable
and
good
overall
would
i
buy
it
again
well
i
got
it
for
free
and
i
would
like
to
explore
new
oktoberfests
but
this
was
very
good
and
spicy
so
yes
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
an
copper
rusty
color
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
without
much
retention
subtle
aroma
of
a
little
caramel
maltyness
a
malty
taste
with
very
subtle
caramel
notes
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
and
finishes
easily
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
not
too
bad
either
decent
representation
of
the
style
will
most
likely
have
it
again
next
fall
when
its
available
dr
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
try
it
on
draught
but
otherwise
its
just
not
interesting
enough
to
pursue
id
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
but
elsewise
its
not
worth
picking
up
this
brewery
has
better
offerings
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
pretty
clear
amber
with
a
thick
finebubbled
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
has
a
nice
fruity
note
mouthfilling
flavor
is
fruity
almost
entirely
apple
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
crisp
smooth
texture
is
quite
fizzy
and
leaves
a
fruity
tingly
finish
overall
ok
if
not
outstanding
oeasy
to
drink
with
the
alcohol
virtually
undetectable
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
think
about
just
put
in
the
glass
and
enjoy
this
is
a
very
clear
beer
that
has
a
light
copper
tone
to
it
almost
a
burnt
orange
color
and
its
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
it
smells
crisp
and
has
hunts
a
wheat
malts
and
some
mild
citrus
its
light
on
the
tongue
and
feels
crisp
with
some
mild
carbonation
there
is
some
mild
bitterness
to
it
over
all
some
mild
hops
and
some
bread
flavors
do
come
through
its
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
the
finish
was
pretty
much
spot
on
with
what
i
expected
in
this
style
very
crisp
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
for
the
most
part
was
well
hidden
until
the
brew
got
warmer
once
warm
it
almost
had
a
bit
of
a
cheesy
aspect
to
it
which
got
interested
but
overall
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
marzen
but
not
one
that
i
would
turn
up
my
nose
at
it
almost
comes
off
as
a
bit
of
a
marzen
lite
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
suppose
that
had
i
bought
a
6pack
i
could
have
downed
it
all
in
one
sitting
the
alcohol
cant
be
felt
here
and
i
was
surprised
how
high
it
was
when
i
looked
on
here
this
wouldnt
blow
anyone
away
but
for
a
night
out
with
the
guys
this
would
be
a
good
choice
to
celebrate
the
season
whether
this
is
a
worthy
beer
to
watch
during
an
epic
collapse
by
the
bullpen
is
another
matter
overall
impression
very
drinkable
enjoyable
interpretation
of
the
style
somewhat
lacking
in
malt
depth
o
enjoyable
brew
that
is
worth
repeating
o
great
fall
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
bit
watery
for
the
style
and
hoppy
but
still
a
solid
beer
o
this
beer
wasnt
bad
at
all
above
average
and
one
of
the
few
i
have
enjoyed
from
spoetzl
o
decent
for
the
octoberfest
style
but
nothing
stands
out
in
this
one
overall
i
really
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
from
a
bottle
then
i
tried
it
on
tap
and
the
taste
was
much
more
promising
interesting
how
much
of
a
difference
fresh
makes
this
is
a
good
stepping
stone
beer
for
those
unfamiliar
with
ofest
brews

overall
a

oktoberfest
from

the
taste
is
medicore
maybe
worse
some
slight
graininess
that
reminds
me
of
other
octoberfests
however
it
ends
in
a
dirty
and
vegetal
manner
not
appetizing
this
beer
is
a
boring
take
on
the
style
that
manages
to
finish
in
an
offputting
way
i
might
drink
another
bottle
of
the
free
6
pack
but
i
kind
of
doubt
it
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
from

a
fairly
aggressive
pour

small

medium
foamy

quickly

much
stronger
pick
up
the

a

some

is
a

on
the
thin
side
and
carbonation
is
likewise
a

fizzy

is
like
flavor
overall
maybe
it
wouldve
been
better
warmed
a
bit
out
of
my
cold
fridge
but
id
only
drink
this
again
if
i
didnt
have
any
better
options
drinkability
its
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
its
one
of
those
beers
where
you
can
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
them
pretty
good
overall
an
okay
beer
drinkable
but
not
one
that
i
would
purchase
again
final
beer
of
the
night
out
one
that
i
had
my
misgivings
about
ordering
but
it
was
the
only
one
there
i
had
yet
to
try
it

a

by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
apple
skin
light
grapefruit
light
mandarin
orange
greens
and
toffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mixed
greens
light
caramel
very
light
mandarin
orange
syrup
grass
and
flowers
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
slick
feel
overall
a
kinda
sad
ofest
one
that
shuns
malt
in
favor
of
fruitiness
and
whatnot
not
my
cup
of
oktober
tea
overallit
just
angers
me
that
they
keep
putting
out
shitty
beers
and
that
idiots
like
me
keep
buying
thembut
at

theyre
singles
dont
purchase

poured
on

into
a
shaker
pint
comes
out
a
golden
amber
color
light
with
some
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
even
as
it
warms
nor
am
i
picking
up
any
malty
festbier
flavors
in
the
body
drinks
like
a
light
version
of
shiner
unremarkable
that
being
said
im
not
tremendously
excited
about
this
beer
either
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
wows
me
overall
solidly
good
but
not
great
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
that
this
of
a
much
lighter
hue
than
most
of
the
high
end
oktoberfests
with
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
aromas
a
super
grainy
but
not
in
the
least
bit
toasty
which
is
highly
disappointing
flavorwise
it
more
in
common
with
a
a
loaf
of
white
bread
than
any
sort
of
toast
its
very
bready
with
a
hint
of
caramel
maltiness
but
doesnt
begin
to
explore
the
darker
notes
that
are
the
reasons
i
seek
out
oktoberfests
in
the
first
place
if
i
were
to
make
a
10
item
list
of
the
characteristics
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
marzen
this
beer
would
have
only
two
of
them
and
theyre
the
proper
weight
and
texture
no
need
to
try
another
overall
very
basic
märzen
style
very
light
and
basic
drinkable
but
nothing
to
highlight
o
this
is
an
okay
oktoberfest
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
but
its
not
bad
o
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
a
lot
better
ones
out
there
ill
stick
with
them
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
despite
its
flaws
but
because
of
its
flaws
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
ever
o
a
thick
malty
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
this
is
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
oktoberfest
its
a
bit
dilute
relative
to
the
standard
and
lacks
much
trailing
sweetness
worth
a
try
but
not
a
go
to
oktoberfest
unfortunately
overall
a
very
unexpected
treat
from
shiner
i
havent
really
had
anything
from
them
since
the
holiday
cheer
apricot
beer
and
this
one
is
equally
as
awesome
true
to
authentic
dr
easy
going
here
pours
amber
in
color
with
thick
creamcolored
head
leaving
good
lacing
on
the
glass
tons
of
carbonation
has
a
grainy
slightly
acidic
aroma
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
with
some
yeast
aromas
as
well
the
beer
tastes
malty
nutty
with
some
caramel
sweetness
floral
hops
come
through
leaving
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
thin
and
nicely
crisp
mouthfeel
disappointing
o
overall
eh
shiners
dortmunder
and
doppelbock
were
so
good
that
this
my
favorite
style
of
all
is
just
a
little
underwhelming
o
its
fair
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
would
say
i
could
session
this
one
easy
enough
o
overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
i
look
forward
to
fall
offerings
all
year
and
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
many
german
and
microbrewed
marzen
or
oktoberfest
beers
this
one
is
less
expensive
than
most
and
it
tastes
like
that
as
well
the
color
is
a
bit
light
the
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
and
the
aroma
is
no
very
strong
it
does
have
a
nice
head
but
other
than
that
i
would
not
recommend
buying
this
beer
when
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
pours
to
a
foamy
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
ring
of
suds
and
minimal
lacing
color
is
a
goldamber
tint
and
is
light
for
the
style
smells
faintly
of
munich
malt
and
caramel
malts
but
with
a
distinct
shiner
twang
all
over
it
flavor
is
nice
but
not
as
malty
and
sweet
as
i
would
expect
for
the
style
finishes
dry
with
little
lingering
maltiness
or
hoppiness
overall
i
think
the
beer
misses
the
mark
but
is
not
terrible
in
fact
i
enjoy
it
very
much
it
is
a
great
value
and
a
clean
brew
this
pours
a
clear
light
amberish
color
with
a
decent
white
head
with
decent
retention
for
a
shiner
product
that
is
the
smell
is
light
and
a
little
malty
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
a
touch
of
hops
with
a
nice
caramel
aftertaste
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
more
though
because
i
had
so
low
of
expectations
since
it
was
a
shiner
product
summary
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
gave
it
an
8
010
or
b
when
i
first
drank
this
i
wasnt
aware
that
this
beer
was
the
shiner
96
anniversary
beer
i
can
see
why
they
turned
it
into
a
regular
seasonal
brew
its
simple
it
looks
great
and
tastes
great
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
darker
version
of
dos
equis
this
seasonal
beer
is
a
great
choice
for
octoberfest
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
next
year
a
nice
job
for
shiner
and
priced
fair
and
reasonable
sample
from
dave
thanks
buddy
d
the
carbonation
drops
its
drinkability
a
little
other
than
that
it
is
a
nice
drink
but
nothing
to
search
out
for
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
an
oktoberfest
mixed
six
a
week
or
so
back
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
foam
on
top
aromas
of
caramel
lightly
roasted
malt
and
biscuits
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
pretty
drinkable
light
caramel
mostly
but
some
apple
and
sweet
malt
show
up
as
well
taste
is
simialr
lightly
caramelly
barley
and
lightly
toasty
bread
hint
of
apple
light
sweetness
just
dominates
before
light
bitterness
joins
to
make
it
dryish
and
toasty
with
some
leafy
vaguely
herbal
character
that
takes
over
at
the
finish
and
lingers
with
toasty
barley
it
is
very
nice
an
enjoyable
solid
viennatype
marzen
there
are
many
ofests
much
better
than
this
one
very
very
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
d
low
abv
and
pretty
good
flavors
here
make
this
a
pretty
good
drink
little
lighter
than
some
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
this
year
but
not
back
another
pretty
good
brew
from
shiner
overall
not
bad
middle
of
the
road
drinkability
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
seems
to
be
a
bit
heavy
on
the
hops
and
slightly
oxidized
from
the
trip
up
to
toledo
ohio
might
help
if
they
used
pryoff
caps
could
also
use
a
bit
more
of
that
toasty
malt
richness
that
gives
oktoberfests
a
touch
more
of
a
fortifying
feel
and
balance
without
tipping
the
drinkability
scale
this
is
a
fair
example
of
the
style
and
while
you
could
find
better
its
not
one
to
avoid
pours
a
clear
copper
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
yeast
and
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
marzen
oktoberfest
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
hop
slight
yeast
and
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
decent
appearance
good
aroma
blend
and
feel
drinkability
decently
complex
which
makes
for
enough
enjoyment
but
could
be
more
so
maybe
this
one
is
too
wellbalanced
good
brew
still
and
easy
to
drink
d
if
nothing
else
shiner
beers
are
drinkable
malt
sweetness
is
at
just
the
right
level
to
make
it
appealing
and
low
bitterness
makes
it
go
down
easily
d
this
is
an
easy
sessionable
beer
but
its
rather
boring
in
oktoberfests
defense
the
style
defines
a
beer
that
is
more
bland
than
vibrant
but
with
other
beers
like
woodcut
4
falling
in
the
same
category
its
difficult
to
dole
out
high
scores
here
an
o
k
oktoberfest
d
the
beer
is
light
and
pretty
low
on
the
flavor
the
abv
is
not
very
high
so
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
not
the
best
oktoberfest
style
beer
but
also
not
the
worse
ive
had
if
this
had
a
little
more
flavor
this
would
be
better
dit
is
pretty
drinkable
it
goes
down
well
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
in
the
future
pretty
mediocre
the
body
seemed
kind
of
watery
and
the
taste
wasnt
all
that
impressive
perhaps
its
my
overly
malted
tongue
at
this
time
of
year
but
this
one
seemed
thin
and
unable
to
compete
with
the
others
sorry
i
typically
pour
my
oktoberfest
beers
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
light
copper
toned
hue
and
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
offputting
to
me
similar
to
the
curious
odor
of
their
famous
bock
only
with
a
bigger
sweeter
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
less
than
complex
at
first
it
seems
as
if
its
much
too
light
bodied
and
watery
to
be
considered
an
oktoberest
but
then
the
toasted
malts
come
into
play
and
the
beer
ends
up
actually
having
a
pretty
nice
finish
it
may
be
a
bit
of
a
boring
brew
but
its
so
unoffensive
and
goes
down
so
easy
that
its
hard
to
down
right
loathe
it
its
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
by
any
means
and
its
not
my
favorite
shiner
brew
but
if
one
happens
to
find
its
way
into
my
pint
glass
i
dont
hesitate
to
finish
it
off
overall
i
believe
shiner
has
a
done
a
great
job
creating
another
great
u
s
made
oktoberfest
bier
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
some
more
this
fall
awesome
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
day
when
i
heard
shiner
was
coming
back
with
their
marzen
i
had
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
d
good
drinkability
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
style
and
the
light
taste
and
feel
are
probably
helping
it
out
in
regards
to
me
i
dig
the
shiner
salty
lick
the
barrell
aftertaste
and
it
carried
over
to
this
offering
so
probst
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
creamy
overall
this
is
a
bit
subdued
not
terribly
rich
in
terms
of
flavor
and
aroma
little
depth
drinkable
but
not
a
memorable
example
of
the
style
opinion
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
have
tried
it
after
a
spaten
and
a
paulaner
and
it
didnt
really
compare
at
the
time
since
this
is
my
first
beer
it
is
finishing
pretty
decent
and
will
help
the
review
notes
its
a
pretty
wellbalanced
oktoberfest
the
but
the
metallic
taste
is
unfortunate
i
dont
think
id
get
this
again
since
there
are
so
many
better
oktos
around
this
time
of
year
the
beer
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
earthy
hops
and
surprisingly
some
flowery
notes
the
flavor
is
toffee
caramel
and
light
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
but
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
shiner
drinkability
if
consumed
while
cold
this
would
be
acceptable
in
servings
of
three
any
more
than
three
and
youre
probably
gonna
be
bored
out
of
your
mind
in
fact
keeping
it
to
two
might
make
you
consider
drinking
it
again
sometime
the
midrange
abv
will
keep
you
sensible
for
the
first
few
in
terms
of
fitting
the
oktoberfest
style
i
would
probably
group
this
in
the
oktoberfest
light
category
it
has
all
the
characteristics
but
theyre
just
not
prevalent
enough
for
me
3
out
of
5
not
too
bad
a
little
dull
but
a
nice
malt
profile
i
would
enjoy
this
again
very
easy
drinking
d
not
a
bad
entry
into
the
oktoberfests
this
season
im
really
enjoying
this
with
my
window
open
and
the
cool
breeze
coming
on
bring
on
fall
poured
into
a
stein
a
clear
copperbronze
with
a
well
formed
one
finger
crown
atop
caramellight
toastand
bread
dough
aromasthe
caramel
malt
is
the
most
assertive
of
the
threemaybe
a
bit
one
sided
but
not
bad
caramel
sweetness
also
dominates
the
flavors
at
the
onsetslightly
doughy
with
a
bit
os
aniselikeflavors
in
the
finish
its
a
decent
stab
at
a
festmarzen
beermaybe
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
but
its
not
bad
drinkability
a
tad
muted
though
perfectly
drinkable
acceptable
oktoberfest
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
appearance
with
a
really
substantial
head
and
great
lacing
nose
has
a
nice
woody
tone
with
a
slight
sweetness
tastes
like
it
smells
not
heavy
but
full
malty
flavor
seems
a
little
diluted
for
this
style
but
okay
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
not
a
bad
beer
here
again
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
totally
acceptable
2nd
tier
oktoberfest
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
really
nothing
else
to
write
home
about
given
the
opportunity
id
try
any
other
oktoberfest
over
this
one
i
wasnt
expecting
a
masterpiece
but
this
is
one
of
the
poorer
ofests
i
have
had
makes
leinies
ofest
look
like
an
alltime
great
which
it
isnt
the
brewery
survived
the
great
purge
and
get
points
for
that
now
its
time
to
tweak
the
recipes
away
from
the
adjunct
lager
formula
and
broaden
their
horizons
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
bad
but
it
isnt
that
great
this
beer
jsut
confuses
me
with
its
mediocrity
d
easily
drinkable
pretty
good
malt
character
conclusion
what
is
with
shiner
and
its
metallic
twang
aftertaste
i
want
to
like
their
beer
but
they
make
it
so
difficult
i
have
concluded
that
shiner
should
be
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
to
me
it
cuts
down
on
the
metallic
aftertaste
the
beer
actually
performs
better
if
it
stays
in
the
bottle
overall
not
the
best
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
d
this
beer
is
decent
it
has
some
of
the
expected
flavor
and
i
cant
really
complain
too
much
i
wish
they
had
upped
the
ante
overall
though
pretty
average
brew
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
with
a
descent
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
malts
predominated
throughout
on
the
palatte
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
most
marzens
but
what
it
lacked
in
body
it
made
up
in
taste
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
on
the
tongue
in
true
german
fashion
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
the
folks
at
spoetzl
two
thumbs
up
its
easy
to
drink
especially
for
shiner
loyals
if
you
love
shiners
other
beers
youll
probably
love
this
overall
not
being
too
impressed
wthe
bock
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
especially
for
the
price
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
octoberfestmarzen
beer
from
an
american
brewery
thats
pretty
true
to
style
this
one
fits
the
bill
its
pretty
decent
pours
out
very
clear
in
a
lighter
shade
of
amber
with
a
foamy
modest
white
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
thats
been
slightly
toasted
the
taste
is
very
true
to
german
tradition
with
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
contributing
notes
of
caramel
and
nuts
and
just
a
hint
of
clean
hops
i
would
say
it
is
fairly
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
from
a
cold
bottle
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
at
a
saloon
in
fort
worth
tx
this
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
orange
amber
highlights
under
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
signature
shiner
aroma
of
sweet
candied
malt
dominates
the
nose
the
familiar
brisk
sweet
and
robust
malt
feel
of
oktoberfest
takes
front
and
center
here
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
palatesticking
dry
resonance
very
smooth
and
refreshing
drinkability
nice
amber
with
fluffy
white
head
classy
looking
marzen
smells
of
toasty
malts
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
bit
of
hay
taste
is
a
semisweet
malt
the
hay
notes
carry
over
into
it
with
some
hops
at
the
finish
nice
fall
beer
an
very
good
for
the
style
they
could
beef
up
the
alcohol
content
a
bit
and
this
would
be
on
par
with
spaten
in
my
opinion
d
a
pretty
good
marzen
i
would
buy
it
again
a
decent
brew
with
a
hint
of
stale
apple
and
malt
in
the
initial
splash
then
a
lingering
cereal
seems
to
be
a
hard
thing
to
get
rid
of
for
the
brewery
but
a
lot
of
there
lagers
have
a
disappointing
malt
finish
one
dimensional
malt
that
doe
not
last
at
all
bitter
then
plain
sugar
finish
drinkability
i
give
this
a
2
mug
rating
meaning
i
could
drink
2
glasses
before
i
got
tired
of
it
its
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
marzen
light
a
really
good
beer
but
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
whole
6pk
verdict
a
solid
little
oktoberfest
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
seen
come
out
of
shiner
in
quite
a
while
i
just
wish
id
tried
it
back
when
it
came
out
the
first
time
so
i
could
comment
on
whether
it
has
changed
at
all
not
bad
i
get
some
soapy
hops
for
some
reason
which
makes
for
a
strange
tasting
oktoberfest
overall
not
the
worst
that
i
have
had
from
shiner
but
nothing
i
would
recommend
this
is
an
really
good
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
that
spoetzl
has
produced
far
better
than
their
usual
session
brews
for
the
price
it
isnt
a
bad
value
and
i
may
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
to
throw
back
during
a
football
game
or
two
less
dumbed
down
than
most
of
shiners
beers
buttery
caramel
malts
are
both
a
little
toasty
and
a
little
sweet
but
neither
actually
seems
to
want
to
take
the
reigns
and
give
the
beer
an
identity
really
not
much
else
going
on
here
pretty
dull
effort
for
an
oktoberfest
there
is
a
sip
or
two
in
each
bottle
where
i
think
this
beer
has
some
promise
but
unfortunately
the
next
drink
washes
those
optimistic
thoughts
away
i
have
been
digging
on
most
of
shiners
new
seasonal
brews
but
this
one
pretty
much
falls
flat
on
its
face
thin
bubbly
and
lifeless
reminds
me
of
a
leinienkugels
pours
a
deep
orange
smell
is
great
with
nice
head
and
lacing
i
love
fall
beers
and
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
i
happy
to
hear
shiner
will
bring
this
brew
out
every
fall
d
good
effort
for
the
style
but
lacking
excitement
this
is
not
your
best
marzen
but
very
far
from
the
worst
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
has
a
very
strong
malt
smell
and
flavor
it
was
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
there
was
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
at
the
end
it
had
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
one
i
would
drink
again
if
they
were
to
make
it
again
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
style
especially
given
that
many
of
the
imports
to
the
us
now
seem
to
be
watered
down
versions
of
what
they
once
were
no
flaws
pretty
damned
drinkable
as
far
as
acessibility
goes
but
perhaps
somewhat
lacking
for
the
style
in
depth
brought
back
a
case
of
this
from
a
trip
to
shiner
on
a
sausage
and
beer
pilgrimage
dark
copper
color
nice
head
at
first
but
it
dissipates
quickly
malty
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
another
fine
old
worldstyle
beer
from
the
folks
in
shiner
copper
color
with
nice
head
a
sweet
finish
pretty
decent
beer
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
in
shiner
tx
head
was
alright
but
dissipated
kind
of
quickly
flavor
was
malty
and
sweet
pretty
good
mouthfeel
lacing
on
glass
was
minimal
pretty
good
effort
this
beer
is
very
nice
for
an
octoberfest
which
i
ususally
enjoy
anyway
it
has
a
hint
of
fruit
and
smell
of
fruit
but
the
fruit
does
not
overwhelm
your
senses
drinkability
this
isnt
so
bad
i
must
admit
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
some
oktoberfests
are
and
there
is
some
depth
to
the
malt
profile
but
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
wellbalanced
mouth
enters
mouth
with
sharp
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
fades
quickly
to
an
almost
flat
watery
mouthfeel
excellent
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
no
alcoholic
flavor
the
taste
is
light
full
bodied
grassy
slightly
acidic
like
unripe
peaches
it
was
well
balances
the
acidity
wasnt
overpowering
and
the
bitterness
lasted
well
in
the
mouth
i
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
beers
drinkability
rating
is
good
it
goes
down
quite
well
and
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
in
the
finish
since
i
have
not
had
more
of
the
spoetzl
offerings
it
is
definitely
making
me
want
to
go
out
there
and
hunt
some
down
cant
say
that
about
other
breweries
out
of
texas
no
offense
though
in
college
i
used
to
be
a
lone
star
but
that
was
quite
a
long
time
ago
drinkability
this
beer
despite
its
shortcomings
drinks
down
incredibly
easy
not
the
top
of
the
style
but
a
decent
offering
from
the
spoetzl
brewery
better
than
some
oktoberfests
ive
had
lately
and
not
as
good
as
others
does
shiner
make
this
one
yearround
if
so
that
would
be
the
advantage
to
buying
this
beer
getting
an
oktoberfest
in
the
springsummer
very
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
because
of
price
being
so
good
but
id
prefer
a
pale
ale
starting
the
night
with
this
one
would
be
okay
then
id
need
to
move
notes
ive
had
minimal
success
with
this
brewery
but
this
has
revived
my
interest
a
heady
amber
topped
by
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
in
the
glass
a
little
nutty
at
first
but
it
is
then
dominated
by
seet
vienna
and
munich
malt
smells
the
taste
is
the
only
area
of
the
beer
i
really
have
any
grip
it
is
over
sweet
and
not
enough
balance
to
all
the
big
malt
flavor
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
have
2
left
of
as
it
wil
go
well
with
some
pork
chops
later
this
week
just
not
something
to
blow
the
german
beer
lover
away
pours
a
pretty
enough
amber
color
with
a
good
head
but
thats
about
where
it
stops
its
an
okay
aroma
nothing
offensive
a
slight
note
of
malt
the
taste
is
oxidized
and
just
funky
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
dissapointing
drinkability
very
soso
at
best
damn
easy
to
drink
give
me
a
liter
and
some
pretzels
id
be
happy
i
sure
enjoyed
this
beer
too
bad
shiner
will
not
release
this
beer
every
year
i
hope
shiner
97
will
be
as
good
if
so
i
might
have
too
rethink
my
opinions
on
this
brewery
i
purchased
a
bottle
in
omaha
i
might
have
to
grab
a
sixpack
before
it
is
past
its
prime
andor
no
more
not
a
shabby
beer
i
say
try
one
overall
a
good
session
beer
i
wish
i
had
some
other
shiner
beers
to
try
next
to
this
because
it
really
seems
like
it
tastes
like
others
they
make
namely
the
blonde
i
want
to
know
what
hops
and
malts
go
into
this
one
and
compare
it
with
bock
and
blonde
or
maybe
its
just
the
water
spoetzl
shiner
beer
at
least
the
three
that
ive
had
prior
to
this
one
runs
the
gamut
from
terrible
blonde
through
not
good
bock
to
decent
hefe
96
falls
into
the
latter
category
even
if
it
isnt
a
classic
example
of
the
style
or
a
beer
that
will
turn
many
heads
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
starts
with
light
amount
of
malt
and
is
taken
over
by
a
substantial
hop
presence
that
would
have
been
nice
if
this
thing
had
the
malt
to
back
it
up
the
mouthfeel
is
just
too
light
somewhat
golden
amber
in
color
ok
carbonation
level
sweet
malt
aroma
medicinal
and
metallic
flavors
dominate
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
finish
ok
mouthfeel
overall
very
average
the
medicinalmetallic
flavors
really
detract
from
the
whole
experience
id
skip
this
one
really
liked
the
special
packaging
with
historical
notations
etc
the
taste
is
a
light
mellow
malt
sweetness
with
some
nut
characteristics
that
are
quickly
washed
away
by
very
citrusy
hop
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
bready
and
pleasing
though
this
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
i
feel
it
is
probably
the
most
balanced
example
of
the
marzen
style
ive
had
the
color
is
righton
and
it
avoids
the
sicklysweetness
that
can
often
plague
a
marzen
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
think
i
like
shiner
bock
better
but
both
of
them
are
easy
drinkers
beer
is
good
happy
märzen
beering
draft
at

in

christi
good
thing
96
has
some
hops
and
flavor
to
it
bad
thing
the
hops
are
quite
harsh
at
times
and
dont
blend
well
and
then
there
was
a
chemicallike
alkaline
taste
that
seemed
to
hover
in
and
out
of
my
taste
buds
dont
know
what
thats
from
but
overall
great
effort
from
the
little
brewery
in
shiner
pours
a
yellowishalmost
amber
pretty
dang
clear
and
with
a
small
head
that
subsides
quickly
but
leaves
a
thin
white
veil
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
aroma
is
all
malt
with
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
no
hop
aroma
complex

flavors
again
with
a
toasty
character
no
hop
flavor
medium
bodied
finishes
dry
has
more
hop
bite
than
i
would
expect
for
this
style
im
impressed
that
this
beer
came
from
shiner
its
not
as
good
as
the
german
beers
of
the
same
style
but
is
definately
worthy
of
drinking
pours

clear
bright

toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
buttery
caramel
followed
by
some
dry
bready
notes
and
then
a
bit
of
a
woodiness
along
with
a
touch
of
a
metallic
twang
its
nice
to
see
shiner
branching
out
into
some
new
beers
but
this
one
is
far
from
great
not
a
drinkable
beer
here
from
the
moment
you
taste
this
it
is
like
something
biting
your
tongue
this
beer
is
seriously
unbalanced
it
needs
to
be
reformulated
completely
overall
a
pretty
good
märzen
but
could
benefit
from
some
additional
malt
to
balance
the
bitterness
there
are
certainly
better
oktoberfests
out
there
but
this
one
is
serviceable
and
if
it
introduces
a
few
shiner
drinkers
to
this
wonderful
beer
style
the
world
will
be
a
slightly
better
place
12
ounce
bottle
shiner
96
pours
out
an
amber
color
with
a
inch
of
heads
that
fades
quickly
there
appears
to
be
very
little
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
aroma
is
fruit
and
caramel
definitely
an
ale
aroma
the
flavor
is
better
than
i
expected
though
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
fruit
toasted
malt
caramel
the
flavor
is
much
too
sweet
however
i
actually
prefer
this
beer
cold
there
is
also
a
distracting
metallic
flavor
this
beer
is
not
competely
bad
it
is
just
bad
in
most
respects
easily
the
bestcrafted
beer
shiner
has
ever
produced
generally
right
on
the
money
for
the
style
and
a
pretty
tasty
beer
to
boot
nothing
too
special
here
but
generally
pleasant
enough
for
a
quick
quaff
drinkability
showed
a
litlle
promise
but
didnt
deliver
might
be
okay

transparent
auburn
body
smells
of
nutty
toasted
malts
flavors
are
really
winning
me
over
sweet
upfront
into
a
nutty
character
and
then
just
enough
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
i
was
not
so
impressed
with
could
be
a
bit
too
seltzery
very
drinkable
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
pint
tap
glass
overall
nice
work
im
glad
to
see
texas
getting
getting
back
to
their
roots
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
which
means
it
probably
needs
a
little
more
booze
again
i
am
suspecting
high
mash
temps
so
maybe
some
carapils
or
just
more
malt
period
either
way
a
very
nice
and
surprising
beer
from
the
shinerspoetzel
now
bring
on
the
vienna
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
respectable
white
frothy
head
aroma
is
a
funky
caramel
with
sweet
malt
notes
taste
is
malty
but
there
are
some
diacetyl
offflavors
as
well
way
too
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
very
weak
fairly
quaffable
if
you
enjoy
the
flavor
that
is
which
might
be
a
stretch
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
it
fell
short
very
skippable
pours
a
clear
light
amber
very
little
carbonation
formed
a
thick
head
but
settles
down
after
a
couple
sips
matly
sweetness
in
aroma
tastes
sweet
from
malt
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
to
give
it
a
quick
dry
finish
decent
body
with
alright
mouthfeel
maybe
too
much
carbonation
overall
just
decent
not
overly
impressed
i
havent
anything
from
this
brewery
that
i
have
been
particularly
impressed
with
above
average
but
nothing
great
what
is
significant
is
not
this
individual
admittedly
mediocre
beer
but
who
it
comes
from
spoetzl
is
the
sam
adams
of
the
southwest
a
reliable
ubiquitous
alternative
in
a
bud
light
culture
this
is
their
first
new
beer
in
a
dozen
years
and
their
first
limited
edition
to
my
knowledge
hiring
a
new
brewer
just
last
year
im
hoping
this
is
the
start
of
spoetzl
trying
to
reclaim
their
craft
beer
roots
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
cooperish
color
with
very
little
head
and
little
carbonation
had
a
very
hoppish
smell
the
taste
was
rather
disappointing
tasted
too
hoppy
and
bitter
to
be
a
good
marzen
i
had
tried
at
the
gabf
and
it
tasted
better
there
but
i
was
buzzing
pretty
hard
at
that
point
nice
try
but
not
gonna
find
a
home
in
my
beer
fridge
uf
still
glad
to
see
shiner
breaking
out
with
an
annual
celebration
beer
looking
forward
to
the
next
4
in
a
nutshell
this
beer
is
fantastic
this
has
to
be
the
best
96th
year
anniversary
beer
from
a
south
texas
brewery
that
ive
ever
had
overall
impression
picked
up
a
six
at
greens
in
columbia
sc
on
the
way
to
charleston
for
4
95
i
had
read
about
it
on
the
shiner
web
site
as
a
special
brew
to
celebrate
their
96th
anniversary
so
thought
i
would
try
it
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
faded
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
just
a
faint
whiff
of
sweet
malt
taste
was
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
either
more
of
the
same
faint
maltiness
with
a
touch
of
mild
hop
bitterness
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
but
their
are
much
better
oktoberfests
out
there
the
label
describes
it
as
a
marzen
style
ale
mmmm
i
thought
marzens
were
lagers
go
figure
thanks
to
chaz
for
saving
me
six
bucks
shiner

is
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
rather
large
offwhite
head
carbonation
is
moderate
and
aides
in
some
pretty
good
retention
the
aroma
is
of
rich
caramel
malts
with
an
element
of
dark
fruit
smell
the
taste
is
bready
with
distinct
caramel
taste
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
the
sweetness
factor
is
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
doesnt
cloy
noble
hop
flavor
is
present
but
mainly
serves
as
a
balance
the
finish
is
a
little
weak
after
my
first
couple
of
sips
i
didnt
really
find
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
but
by
the
time
my
mug
warmed
up
the
flavors
had
really
opened
up
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
german
greats
but
still
a
nice
surprise
from
shiner
i
doubt
itll
happen
but
i
hope
they
make
this
a
fall
seasonal
drinkability
is
good

most

some

with
a

bit
more
going
on
with
the

as
there
is

this
style
of
brew
goes
down
easy
with
no

thing
actually
a

that
i
really
liked

bottle
this
hits
the
style
well
very
authentic
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
plenty
of
this
during
oktoberfest
season
o
a
pretty
average
ofest
in
my
opinion
i
bought
it
as
a
single
id
buy
a
6
pack
if
i
saw
it
next
year
this
time
its
a
pretty
beer
to
look
at
and
a
rich
honey
malty
taste
that
begs
a
fall
indulgance
i
enjoyed
this
beer
sprecher
oktoberfest
may
not
be
a
lager
suited
to
seventeen
days
worth
of
gluttonous
drunken
celebration
but
its
a
quintessential
cool
weather
falltime
lager
it
is
hearty
rich
and
substantially
malted
this
brewerys
best
offerings
are
its
german
renditions
not
their
americanstyle
stuff
and
theres
few
styles
more
german
than
oktoberfest
i
had
a
sprecher
left
over
from
a
wurstfest
party
i
through
back
in
september
just
cracked
it
open
and
it
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
rich
copper
with
thin
head
that
is
leaving
a
modest
lace
the
smell
and
taste
are
typical
of
most
oktoberfest
beers
there
is
sweet
malt
esseance
that
provides
both
this
is
a
lighter
medium
body
beer
with
decent
carbonation
overall
its
good
would
i
have
it
again

noticed
after

finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
well
balanced
robust
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
was
a
bottle
from
last
year
or
older
but
it
held
up
nicely
very
enjoyable
offering
o
mild
fruity
carbonation
is
a
hindrance
to
this
lager
a
style
which
should
impart
no
yeast
influence
through
and
through
but
damn
if
it
doesnt
continue
to
go
down
nicely
sprecher
oktoberfest
is
a
crisp
and
easydrinking
version
of
the
german
classic
while
there
are
steps
to
take
to
really
elevate
this
to
something
bigger
it
does
score
with
a
nicely
malty
base
and
hop
followthrough
in
the
feel
o
a
great
marzen
could
have
been
close
to
perfection
had
there
been
a
tad
more
hops
to
break
up
the
malt
a
little
m
lands
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
body
lightly
carbonated
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
slight
head
scent
is
malty
with
some
spices
in
the
mix
taste
has
a
lot
of
spices
like
cinnamon
clove
and
other
roasted
spices
the
texture
is
fantastic
with
a
clean
finish
that
leaves
the
tasty
spices
lingering
a
great
brew
d
pretty
plain
marzen
abv
is
pretty
good
at
6
but
there
is
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
honestly
one
of
the
best
marzens
ive
had
really
surprised
by
this
simple
execution
done
right
this
brew
seems
more
like
a
pumpkin
beer
than
a
marzen
it
has
a
medium
amber
color
and
low
carbonation
the
aroma
has
some
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
this
actually
seems
more
like
a
pumpkin
ale
because
of
the
taste
the
body
seems
just
a
hair
thin
and
is
nicely
smooth
id
have
it
again
o
this
beer
didnt
look
like
much
when
i
poured
it
but
the
nose
was
good
and
the
taste
was
very
clean
and
delicious
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
better
than
the
hackerpschorr
o
4
5
they
really
nailed
this
will
have
to
have
a
lot
to
be
sure
but
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
style
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
as
i
like
the
thick
and
chewy
styles
a
great
mixture
to
form
a
real
sweet
and
inviting
marzen
for
the
season
overall
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
was
able
to
enjoy
the
slightly
sweeter
side
of
beer
as
a
break
from
the
heavierhoppier
selections
ive
had
lately
ill
keep
a
look
out
for
it
again
next
year
when
this
time
comes
around
to
celebrate
the
great
german
tradition
of
beer
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
marzen
style
the
fruity
qualities
make
it
seem
somewhat
like
an
english
ale
opretty
good
beer
to
start
off
the
fall
season
overall
its
a
good
beer
some
oktoberfests
are
too
light
this
one
hits
the
caramelly
malt
notes
well
wish
it
wasnt
a
twist
off
so
i
could
reuse
the
16
oz
bottle
would
probably
help
seal
the
beer
in
better
for
storage
too
really
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
year
enjoyable
true
to
style
with
some
complexity
and
sessionable
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
from
a
us
brewery
that
i
know
of
a
fraction
of
sweetness
and
hops
the
beer
reeks
of
fall
overall
another
impressive
brew
from
sprecher
i
guess
ill
have
to
order
a
case
of
this
when
it
once
again
becomes
available
given
their
germanamerican
heritage
it
was
almost
a
foregone
conclusion
that
sprecher
would
brew
a
pretty
damn
good
oktoberfest
still
its
nice
to
see
and
smell
and
taste
that
they
actually
do
wheres
my
liter
mug
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
best
suited
for
around
a
fire
on
a
crisp
fall
night
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
sprecher
oktoberfest
was
amber
in
color
it
had
a
beige
head
that
didnt
last
the
smell
was
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
toasty
the
taste
was
toasty
caramel
malt
upfront
with
a
little
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
coming
through
towards
the
finish
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
drinkabity
was
good
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
that
is
not
as
sweet
as
most
and
worth
a
try
purchased
at
hy
vee
stony
brook
omaha
ne
12610
very
enjoyable
encourages
me
to
try
other
sprecher
brews
this
beer
pours
a
dark
bronze
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
vanishes
within
seconds
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
some
floral
notes
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
and
a
sugary
texture
overall
this
beer
is
quite
a
let
down
it
is
bland
and
boring
and
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
again
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
depth
in
its
taste
this
is
a
wi
brewed
german
beer
so
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
of
great
german
caliber
but
it
held
up
very
good
a
6
beer
with
a
nice
balance
and
depth
that
makes
it
a
very
enjoyable
drink
appears
a
deep
caramel
amber
hue
with
a
light
beige

not
overly
sweet

mild

very

almost
syrupy

a
bit
cloying
at
times
but
drinks
decently
well
for
the
amount
of
sweetness
drinkability
overall
is
had
to
stomach
this
sweet
malt
driven
brews
are
making
me
crave
hoppy
brews
weird
sprecher
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
just
an
amazing
oktoberfest
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
incredibly
flavorful
and
smooth
drinking
the
malt
shines
through
and
brings
a
delectable
bouquet
of
flavors
and
aromatics
to
the
beer
very
drinkable
no
shame
or
risk
in
offering
this
choice
to
an
oktoberfest
newcomer
d
fairly
drinkable
yet
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drink
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
one
i
will
get
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
great
oktoberfest
and
rivals
staghorn
my
favorite
okto
imo
i
need
to
start
buying
more
sprecher
the
last
two
beers
i
have
tried
have
blown
me
away
keep
up
the
good
work
there
is
a
golf
outing
the
second
tuesday
every
september
i
have
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
right
about
the
time
se
wisconsin
summer
starts
relenting
it
is
a
beautiful
beer
darker
than
most
oktoberfests
with
a
rich
creamy
head
it
smells
of
roasty
caramel
malt
its
taste
is
a
bit
more
malty
and
caramelly
and
full
flavor
than
most
not
as
nutty
as
most
i
expect
a
tad
more
nuttiness
in
an
oktoberfest
but
i
am
not
dissapointed
because
i
am
nut
inot
the
nutty
thing
i
am
so
primed
after
a
long
summer
to

drinkable

a

detracts
from

oktoberfest
is
after
all
an
autumn
celebration
for
the
love
of
good
beer

it
is
a

of
the
road

that
is
probably
not
worth
the
time

money

persistent

a
bit
more

most
german

subtle
noble

balancing
it
out
a
very
pleasant
quaff
all
around
as
the
german
import
oktos
get
yellower
and
thinner
this
may
be
truer
to
the
oktos
of
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
ago
when
this
whole
oktoberfest
thing
started
medium
bodied
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
balanced
by
a
prominent
spice
characteristic
lots
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
along
with
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
nicely
balanced
with
a
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
d
ok
flavor
not
sure
i
would
go
for
it
again
though
ive
enjoyed
all
of
sprechers
beers
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
bunch
drinkability
ive
never
had
anything
that
was
not
impressive
from
sprecher
they
do
a
great
job
on
all
of
their
brews
this
is
my
new
benchmark
for
octoberfests
sprecher
has
presented
a
great
beer
for
the
cool
crisp
air
that
can
be
a
staple
goto
not
too
much
or
too
little
this
is
simply
a
good
beer
d
a
solid
oktoberfest
with
a
good
balance
feel
to
it
granted
its
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
my
tastebuds
are
not
complaining
one
bit
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
yet
another
solid
beer
by
sprecher
big
full
body
on
this
one
still
retains
a
nice
crisp
quality
to
it
though
carbonation
level
is
moderatetohigh
i
really
like
the
flavor
profile
of
this
one
there
some
nice
bittering
hops
in
there
but
it
mostly
consists
of
a
full
bready
mouth
with
touches
of
honey
and
caramel
light
grainy
aftertaste
that
is
pleasant
i
really
dig
this
i
wish
i
could
get
it
around
here
thanks
for
the
hookup
andy
another
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
more
often
mfd
a
thicker
and
fuller
body
than
the
ayinger
a
bit
more
drinkable
too
the
flavour
was
a
bit
more
interesting
minor
update
for
2011
no
metallic
character
this
year
upgrading
taste
to
a
4
poured
in
to
a
0
5l
mug
this
beer
sported
a
dark
amber
to
brown
body
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
saddly
faded
away
aroma
is
of
toasted
malts
and
a
little
metallic
astringency
light
to
medium
bodied
with
malty
flavors
that
follow
the
aroma
the
finish
was
toasty
and
not
bitter
with
a
bit
of
alcoholic
warmth
this
beer
seemed
to
flatten
as
i
drank
it
and
overall
it
wasnt
that
memorable
a
little
bit
on
the
old
side
so
its
probably
not
at
its
best
but
i
can
see
this
one
being
pretty
damn
good
when
fresh
clear
deep
redbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
creamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
and
leaves
no
lacing
strong
caramel
malty
nose
with
some
light
hoppiness
very
creamy
full
body
with
a
slight
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
flavor
has
nice
balance
of
caramel
sweetness
and
noble
hops
slight
nut
and
fruit
berry
near
the
finish
very
enjoyable
a
nice
light
marzen
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
carbonation
reddish
orange
colored
with
a
slight
tan
cap
of
foam
that
settles
quickly
roasted
grain
and
caramel
maltiness
with
some
faint
pumpkin
pie
spice
rich
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
nice
hop
bite
in
the
finish
smooth
with
fine
carbonation
one
of
the
few
decent
american
made
examples
of
the
style
this
is
an
alright
version
of
an
oktoberfest
style
beer
the
color
is
actually
lighter
than
i
thought
the
taste
is
alright
but
once
again
oktoberfest
style
beers
should
be
drank
in
mass
quantities
i
e
drinking
out
of
a
liter
mug
which
is
essentially
three
beers
the
smell
was
the
only
thing
i
considered
interesting
pratically
no
head
at
all
which
is
an
odd
character
on
a
german
style
beer
d
a
decent
marzen
more
aroma
than
bite
but
definitely
german
drank
okay
this
just
was
out
of
style
to
me
maybe
age
has
already
gotten
to
this
other
than
the
schwartz
this
brewery
hasnt
impressed
me
will
try
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
really
fresh
edit
after
having
another
one
i
came
to
notice
that
one
reviewer
was
correct
in
saying
that
it
finishes
pretty
dry
perhaps
that
tingly
feeling
doesnt
amount
to
anything
worthwhile
because
i
noticed
that
it
has
the
same
effect
of
certain
candies
where
the
only
way
to
refresh
yourself
and
knock
certain
flavors
out
of
your
mouth
is
to
just
keep
consuming
more
if
you
happen
to
like
dry
or
even
nearnumbing
beers
then
just
consider
this
as
having
a
tastefully
complex
finish
i
on
the
other
hand
unfortunately
had
to
go
back
and
knock
12
a
point
down
in
the
mouth
feel
and
thusly
demote
the
grade
of
this
beer
but
it
is
still
a
fantastic
brew
that
i
will
continue
to
recommend
d
this
a
very
solid
octoberfest
the
beer
drinks
very
smooth
and
easy
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
large
dense
head
that
falls
to
medium
lacing
the
aroma
is
sharp
large
and
spicy
like
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
a
clingy
mouthfeel
highlights
the
malt
burn
down
the
throat
the
mouthfeel
came
up
a
bit
short
for
me
it
was
lighter
than
i
would
have
liked
there
is
a
light
level
of
carbonation
one
of
the
better
parts
was
the
dry
aftertaste
which
accents
the
beer
and
makes
it
fairly
good
overall
i
would
say
this
was
a
reasonably
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
too
many
of
them
in
a
year
slightly
smooth
and
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
brew
i
thought
this
one
was
so
so
which
didnt
prompt
me
to
order
another
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
my
first
thought
when
this
beer
hit
the
lips
was
full
bodied
and
creamy
as
aforementioned
this
beer
has
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
crisp
with
delicate
carbonation
everything
about
this
beer
just
works
in
combination
with
itself
each
component
of
this
beer
compliments
and
works
with
others
to
create
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
the
oktoberfests
that
ill
put
in
my
top
five
ofests
its
definitely
one
that
ill
recommend
to
others
unlike
many
of
the
ofests
ive
had
its
got
an
authentic
real
feel
to
it
very
drinkable
brew
the
16oz
went
down
in
a
hurry
i
probably
could
have
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
anticipated
from
sprecher
16oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
color
mine
had
a
fairly
decent
tan
head
on
it
but
it
drops
away
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
enough
there
are
notes
of
caramel
malts
and
possibly
some
fruits
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
very
clean
a
little
sweet
with
a
mild
spiciness
to
it
hints
of
dark
fruit
with
the
caramel
malt
very
drinkable
d
nice
oktoberfest
brew
well
worth
a
shot
for
an
americanized
version
spercher
oktoberfest
a
dark
ambercopper
color
this
is
the
darkest
ofest
i
have
ever
seen
smell
has
the
typical
malty
smell
of
ofests
and
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
up
front
a
good
malty
sweetness
it
is
followed
by
a
medium
hop
bite
it
has
decent
balance
not
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
was
good
and
this
beer
has
very
nice
drinkability
good
ofest
from
a
good
brewery
overall
drinkability
is
good
definitely
a
decent
oktoberfest
makes
me
want
to
sample
some
of
their
other
brews
not
overly
impressed
by
this
sprecher
offering
but
it
is
not
bad
all
the
same
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
clear

that
yields

thin
finger

certainly
goodvery

and
certainly
better
than
many
other
oktoberfests
ive
tried
this
season
floral
hops
complement
the
malt
nicely
the
mouthfeel
drives
spreckers
oktoberfest
to
me
excellent
smooth
on
the
palate
very
good
all
around
delicious
no
weaknesses
fine
stuff
and
well
worth
trying
from
one
of
my
favorite
sleeper
breweries
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
perfect
for
a
fall
drinking
session
my
bottle
was
labeled
6
abv
so
i
should
slow
the
drinking
down
a
little
bit
d
a
really
nice
ofest
that
wont
change
the
world
but
will
satisfy
any
oktoberfest
lover
like
me
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
id
buy
this
again
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
tad
off
bought
it
last
fall
and
have
had
it
in
the
fridge
for
23
months
so
it
may
have
been
on
the
edge
freshness
wise
it
poured
a
clear
amberold
copper
in
color
with
a
minimal
quickly
diminishing
offwhite
head
aromas
of
toffee
dark
bready
malts
and
a
vague
fruitiness
taste
was
mostly
the
malts
hops
underlying
and
a
touch
of
sourness
in
the
finish
frothy
and
finishes
relatively
drying
and
a
bit
puckering
mediumbodied
sessionable
the
only
thing
maltier
would
be
a
bowl
of
grapenuts
one
of
the
better
ofest
made
stateside
i
wull
check
this
one
out
again
drinkability
is
good
though
somewhat
lacking
in
body
and
boldness
this
is
an
otherwise
solid
marzen
not
the
best
from
sprecher
but
a
decent
brew
shocking
that
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
a
sprecher
beer
this
seasonal
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
that
diminishes
pretty
quickly
stringy
lacing
caramel
malt

with
touches

mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
roasted
malt
caramel
and
plum
flavors
touches
of
mildly
bitter
hops
are
there
as
well
the
finish
is
short
and
sweet
with
a
caramel
aftertaste
overall
this
is
an
above
average
oktoberfest
this
was
very
enjoyable
as
it
pushes
the
limits
of
the
style
a
little
bit
a
must
try
overall
a
very
tasty
and
robust
oktoberfest
pours
a

than
most
but
theres
something
about
it
that
i
dont
really
enjoy
drinkability
im
not
sure
why
i
have
heard
so
many
high
ratings
for
this
beer
michael
jackson
and
lots
of
my
friends
agree
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
im
afraid
that
i
must
disagree
on
this
one
this
is
the
2nd
one
that
i
have
had
and
they
are
consistant
at
being
not
very
drinkable
watery
and
has
the
rusty
metallic
off
flavor
that
make
it
downright
bad
the
smell
is
the
only
redeeming
quality
that
i
really
noticed
on
this
beer
rich
and
malty
but
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
good
substantial
without
being
chewy
or
stout
drinkability
all
day
good
beer
but
i
just
wasnt
in
a
rush
to
finish
these
off
this
beer
had
a
nice
orangeamber
color
had
a
decent
1
12
head
with
medium
lacing
it
has
a
decent
smell
of
some
herbs
and
malts
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
a
clean
taste
and
is
smooth
this
is
a
change
of
pace
from
what
i
usually
drink
but
was
good
a
clear
deep
red
colored
body
tiny
white
head
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
scent
is
that
familiar
oktoberfest
malt
smell
caramel
and
grainy
notes
same
goes
for
the
taste
pretty
solid
caramel
malt
flavor
some
breadybiscuit
notes
not
a
bad
oktober
check
it
out
d
solid
oktoberfest
d
im
going
on
my
previous
experience
with
this
beer
and
beers
from
this
brewery
a
solid
choice
with
any
style
this
brewery
is
great
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
as
it
warmed
up
very
nice
this
is
pretty
on
for
the
style
the
only
thing
i
noticed
that
was
different
from
the
imported
ofest
beers
is
that
this
had
long
roasted
flavor
that
followed
the
smooth
caramel
malts
the
lager
yeast
could
have
had
a
little
more
character
and
maybe
brought
out
more
complexity
still
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
big
stein
of
it
prost
not
too
bad
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
rich
oktoberfest
brew
might
be
a
touch
past
its
prime
but
holds
up
well
thanks
go
to
merlin48
for
this
fine
sample
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed

tan
head
over
the
clear
dark
amber
brew
head
fades
gradually
with
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
malts
with
a
light
hoppiness
taste
also
shows
the
nutty
grains
upfront
with
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
a
slightly
sour
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
but
its
got
a
little
ways
to
go
before
being
my
desert
island
ofest
another
nice
sprecher
product
sprecher
has
better
beers
out
there
had
again
5
years
later
a
fresh
bottle
and
malts
were
well
attenuated
mild
and
wewll
integrated
smoke
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
but
is
somewhat
boring
i
will
more
than
likely
be
looking
elsewhere
for
future
oktoberfests
easily
drinkable
quite
a
good
representation
of
the
style
would
enjoy
again
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
drinkability
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
a
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
i
think
i
will
stick
with
my
ayinger
luminous
copper
body
with
a
small
beige
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
toasty
and
malty
with
a
big
dose
of
caramel
a
spicy
hop
note
in
the
background
mouth
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
taste
is
awash
in
chewy
caramel
balanced
by
a
pleasant
spicy
hops
bitterness
a
hint
of
red
apple
fruitiness
adds
a
nice
complexity
smooth
toastiness
from
the
bready
caramel
maltiness
is
the
keynote
here
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
american
oktoberfest
biers
burnt
copperish
with
nary
a
head
not
too
much
lacing
either
maybe
the
tap
was
not
the
best
smells
sweet
and
nutty
some
spicy
clovebanana
elements
seemed
to
be
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
dominated
by
a
carameltoffee
maltiness
more
of
a
malty
sweet
than
a
sugary
sweet
which
is
nice
solid
yeasty
flavors
of
biscuit
and
clove
back
this
up
a
touch
of
fruit
from
the
hops
but
really
almost
nothing
malts
dominate
rich
in
flavor
a
bit
of
a
raisiny
finish
lasts
long
fairly
smooth
but
not
poundable
i
enjoyed
this
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
if
you
see
it
try
it
single
bottle
purchased
in
madison
and
smuggled
back
via
checked
baggage
drinkability

this
bier
is
hard
to
drink
slow
mouthfeel
bready
warm
and
very
comforting
felt
good
to
drink
trhis
beer
right
after
work
a
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
blast
of
bubbly
goes
down
smooth
and
satisfying
this
would
definetly
be
a
good
brew
to
pick
up
a
four
pack
of
around
the
fall
season
a
good
seasonal
from
an
underappreciated
brewery
that
makes
some
kick
ass
sodas
as
well
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
big
creamy
khaki
head
doesnt
smell
like
much
musty
barley
malts
a
little
grassy
taste
is
equally
uhh
subtle
grassy
mustysweet
malts
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
fest
beer
i
could
pound
back
about
50
of
them
i
spose
but
i
might
be
a
little
bored
this
is
an
allaround
solid
beer
just
didnt
really
impress
me
anywhere
good
value
though
16
ounce
bottle
pours
out
reddish
brown
with
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
toasted
malt
with
caramel
and
a
spicy
hop
aroma
deep
caramel
malt
flavor
the
malt
is
followed
by
a
tasty
fruit
flavor
hops
are
spicy
and
a
little
floral
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
average
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
sampled
amber
in
color
with
an
orange
brown
tint
and
an
off
white
head
big
malt
aroma
caramel
nut
toasted
and
a
floral
hop
in
the
background
flavor
is
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
finish
of
toast
good
body
and
nice
lingering
finish
another
fine
product
from
sprecher
from
my
buddy
dwight
straight
from
illinois
this
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
no
head
the
nose
is
nice
sweet
caramel
with
some
fruity
tones
but
not
really
something
great
the
flavor
is
lacking
a
bit
its
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
really
doing
much
for
me
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
just
okay
as
the
ofest
beers
go
nice
amber
color
theres
a
decent
head
that
remains
the
whole
way
down
faint

not

malty

upfront
slight

dry
in
the

body
is

a
tad
on
the
thin
side
an
average
beerid
like
it
to
have
a
bit
umph
to
it
in
flavor
and
body
and
i
think
it
could
be
a
quite
good
oktoberfest
thanks
to
bashiba
for
the
trade
and
chance
to
sample
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
enjoyable
for
this
style
of
beer
clear
tawnybronze
in
hue
there
seems
to
be
a
noticeable
coppery
highlight
especially
when
held
to
a
light
at
this
time
i
noticed
a
steady
stream
of
animation
racing
to
the
beige
head
the
foam
was
two
fingers
in
height
at
the
apex
head
retention
was
very
good
and
after
a
few
moments
it
began
to
fade
to
a
bubbly
cap
subsequent
lacing
was
skimpy
but
the
cap
lasted
the
whole
consumption
it
is
a
goodlooking
beer
clean
malty
nose
that
is
slightly
toasty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
grain
grassy
hops
are
at
the
back
the
bouquet
says
ofest
and
that
is
all
i
need
it
to
say
aboveaverage
potency
inviting
sometimes
a
good
thing
can
be
so
simple
the
palate
is
very
enjoyable
it
is
ideally
clean
but
plenty
flavorful
the
malt
comes
across
dry
and
toasty
but
with
another
layer
which
is
sweet
caramel
random
hints
of
breadybiscuit
are
noticed
as
well
the
hops
do
supply
a
crisp
bitterness
and
offer
a
healthy
dose
of
grassy
slightly
earthyspicy
flavors
very
nice
from
start
to
finish
there
is
good
depth
i
like
the
long
taste
as
it
leisurely
tickles
my
tastebuds
yet
it
still
holds
my
attention
as
the
flavors
are
bright
enough
this
is
a
very
solid
ofest
tasty
medium
in
body
if
not
a
tickle
bigger
with
firm
carbonation
all
of
this
adds
up
to
create
a
solid
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
quaff
i
could
session
with
this
beer
easily
bring
on
the
polka
and
pretzels
i
bouquet
a
16ounce
bottle
for
1
40
which
is
a
damn
good
deal
imo
it
was
purchased
in
milwaukee
wi
more
please
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
decent
creamy
off
white
head
with
some
lacing
veggie
and
bready
aromas
fruity
nutty
caramel
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
lasting
sweet
finish
gets
thicker
and
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
oktoberfest
i
have
had
a
very
nice
beer
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
malt
with
gentle
fruit
notes
toward
the
middle
there
is
a
bit
of
white
wine
dryness
the
finish
is
very
clean
bordering
on
too
clean
but
there
is
sufficient
residual
bittering
to
balance
out
nice
maltyness
while
at
the
same
time
the
overall
character
is
a
bit
lighter
and
fruity
than
the
average
ofest
rather
than
being
a
detraction
this
adds
to
the
beers
drikability
overall
a
fairly
complex
beer
im
just
not
sure
all
of
it
works
for
me
much
better
as
it
warms
more
like
a
ale
than
a
lager
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
very
drinkable
like
an
oktoberfest
should
be
by
far
the
reddest
oktoberfest
i
have
seen
to
date
head
sticks
aroung
and
lingers
a
little
bit
on
the
top
the
whole
way
down
honey
and
hops
are
in
the
flavor
which
is
ok
but
nothing
great
has
a
funny
aftertaste
though
not
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
i
have
sampled
thanks
to
jeffboo
for
bringing
it
across
the
border
another
thanks
to
jeffboo
for
the
sample
drinkability
tastes
like
a
macro
lager
wht
little
or
no
ofest
character
wont
try
this
one
again
taste
the
feeling
in
your
mouth
is
very
soft
the
flavors
are
malty
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
session
beer
i
can
see
why
the
germans
drink
oktoberfest
beers
by
the
liter
amberish
color
quick
disappearing
head
a
faint
sweet
hop
aromafirst
taste
faintly
honey
and
carmel
thought
it
would
have
a
bolder
taste
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
but
not
very
complex
it
goes
to
the
end
without
getting
to
bitter
it
seems
sprecher
uses
the
same
kind
of
honey
in
most
of
its
beers
they
taste
somewhat
similar
good
easy
drinking
ofest
i
think
the
hops
were
a
bit
too
pronounced
for
the
style
but
not
at
all
overpowering
this
is
a
good
beer
that
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
one
is
nice
3
are
better
while
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
neither
a
great
ofest
or
a
great
sprecher
buy
some
black
bavarian
if
you
want
sprecher
and
some
elliot
ness
or
wolnzacher
if
you
want
an
ofestmarzen
mostly
clear
reddishcopper
in
color
some
carbonation
but
minimal
head
that
quickly
disappears
a
rich
bold
nose
dominated
by
caramely
malts
underlying
grains
remind
me
hohum
lagers
but
fruity
crisp
hops
are
detectable
too
quite
hoppy
at
the
start
a
strangely
sour
even
metallic
taste
is
too
dominant
in
the
middle
and
early
finish
malts
make
their
way
out
as
the
beer
warms
or
at
least
as
the
mouth
gets
used
to
it
mouthfeel
is
more
watery
than
i
expected
given
the
richness
of
the
nose
but
is
nonetheless
clean
this
one
is
ok
but
not
something
im
going
to
reach
for
given
the
competition
ruby
red
hue
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
as
a
partner
huge
and
wonderful
malty
aroma
very
nice
sweet
off
the
cuff
but
well
done
some
caramel
tones
are
noted
and
they
blend
well
with
the
rich
and
creamy
malts
bordlerline
on
a
full
bodied
beverage
great
body
and
incredible
taste
this
should
be
the
definition
of
a
oktoberfest
beer
deep
copper
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
that
puffs
up
nicely
then
fades
quicklyminimal
lace
or
stick
malty
as
well
as
fruity
on
the
nose
a
pretty
big
mouthfull
of
suds
here
and
pretty
much
a
fine
example
of
the
style
heavy
handed
on
the
malt
yet
still
a
good
dose
of
piney
hops
some
caramel
corn
chimes
in
on
the
finish
as
does
some
burnt
caramel
bitterness
i
have
to
give
the
drinkability
a
low
score
as
sprecher
to
me
is
nearly
always
over
the
top
to
the
point
of
being
flabby
this
one
though
does
grow
on
ya
and
perhaps
with
a
next
sample
i
will
review
a
tad
higher
but
for
now
one
pint
will
be
just
right
looks
like
theres
a
lot
more
variety
in
okto
beers
than
any
style
definition
can
contain
especially
when
american
brewers
are
involved
sprechers
2003
brew
offers
a
nice
dark
complexion
with
a
good
roasty
malt
character
this
in
turn
counterbalances
the
usual
sweetness
of
an
okto
leading
it
to
the
promised
dry
finish
still
the
mouthfeel
comes
in
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
a
good
effort
the
look
is
equally
solid
having
a
beautiful
amber
body
and
substantive
offwhite
head
and
solid
lace
effect
the
feel
is
good
with
a
solid
body
and
finish
to
match
the
dryness
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
the
rathskeller
wine
beer
festa
medium
sized
ivory
head
with
small
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
and
free
of
carbonation
the
hue
was
amber
and
the
lacing
was
good
the
nose
was
moderately
malty
and
it
had
a
malty
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
vert
smooth
light
bodied
and
somewhat
thin
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
has
a
malt
sweetness
and
caramel
scent
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
especially
in
the
finish
flavor
consists
of
toasted
malt
caramel
with
a
slight
spiciness
thats
apparent
overall
great
balance
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
available
and
one
of
sprechers
better
brews
id
definitely
recommend
trying
one
if
you
can
find
it
a
pretty
nice
octoberfest
soft
toasty
nose
taste
is
initially
slick
and
sweetish
with
a
small
spicy
hop
accent
toasted
grains
emerge
after
that
mouthfeel
gives
me
a
somewhat
sticky
sweet
syrupy
texture
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
have
had
several
better
summit
hackerpaulanergoose
titletowncapital
better
than
average
but
not
elite
in
my
opinion
dark
orange
color
clear
pillowy
and
cottony
head
that
ends
up
in
nice
lacy
patterns
slight
bright
yeast
aroma
in
with
maltiness
lightly
spicy
flavors
sense
of
breadypumpkiny
tastes
and
a
cinnamon
spiciness
finishes
with
a
fresh
but
subdued
hop
this
beer
is
typical
of
many
ofests
starts
full
and
malty
and
ends
thinner
and
tighter
makes
for
an
interesting
complexity
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
no
wonder
theyre
served
in
big
ass
steins
good
example
of
style
in
my
opinion
this
clear
copper
brew
is
topped
by
a
slight
creamy
beige
head
that
is
well
retained
a
deep
malty
aroma
accented
by
some
slight
noble
hop
spiciness
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
oktoberfests
in
the
midwest
very
nice
malt
profile
here
the
caramel
tones
stand
out
underneath
that
there
are
layers
of
graininess
and
toastiness
and
to
boot
theres
a
nice
little
emphasis
on
little
hop
kick
and
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
full
bodied
mouthfeel
nice
marzen
sprecher
oktoberfest
dark
copper
colored
beer
under
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
very
nice
sticky
lace
somewhat
mild
initial
tastes
of
malt
but
with
an
unpleasant
taste
that
is
hard
to
place
i
love
sprecher
products
but
this
one
is
not
up
to
their
typical
exceptional
quality
a
very
nice
autumnal
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
to
search
for
when
available
in
the
fall
particularly
if
you
can
sample
it
at
sprecherfest
at
old
heidelburg
park
in
glendale
keg
of
gordonbierschmarzen
beer
drank
i
remember
this
as
being
my
very
first
beer
outside
the
realm
of
coors
and
budweiser
i
loved
it
and
still
love
it
today
best
balanced
beer
i
have
ever
had
too
malty
for
me
not
great
not
terrible
okay
in
a
pinch
very
smooth
o
a
pretty
average
beer
not
necessarily
bad
but
nothing
id
purposely
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
the
only
brew
worth
ordering
at
gordon
biersch
in
my
opinion
very
tasty
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
maybe
my
personal
favorite
from
their
ine
up
overall
a
nice
unassuming
beer
your
american
adjunct
lager
drinking
buddies
should
have
no
issues
with
this
beer
ultimately
however
this
lager
is
little
lacking
in
character
overall
a
fairly
sweet
and
malty
brew
at
only
5
7
abv
with
a
nice
easy
drinking
feel
a
very
enjoyable
year
round
marzen
style
beer
this
beer
means
business
consistent
copper
color
and
persistent
lacing
nice
taste
and
a
swell
finish
i
made
mistake
of
going
beer
for
beer
against
a
guy
who
was
sucking
down
michelob
ultra
in
the
span
of
2
12
hours
i
probably
had
eight
or
nine
of
these
net
effect
was
like
being
kicked
in
the
head
by
a
mule
this
beer
doesnt
pull
its
punches
and
is
better
left
to
be
consumed
slowly
and
responsibly
watch
out
the
verdict
pretty
good
a
solid
malty
lager
with
good
flavor
there
is
not
pretense
of
balance
hoppiness
is
nowhere
to
be
found
still
its
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
beautiful
amber
hue
is
the
first
thing
to
greet
the
eye
upon
pouring
it
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
crisp
to
start
after
a
healthy
inhalation
of
a
bready
grassy
aroma
a
hint
of
something
else
for
sure
but
unfortunately
my
palate
hasnt
developed
enough
to
call
it
out
with
confidence
the
aroma
chases
the
taste
onto
my
tongue
the
bitterness
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
the
finish
is
dry
but
a
bit
disrupted
by
something
and
my
guess
is
that
its
age
alas
here
in
singapore
freshness
is
often
something
to
be
desired
the
bottling
date
puts
it
11
months
ago
but
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
call
it
a
solid
marzen
prost
o
eh
its
a
decent
marzen
that
gets
the
job
done
even
still
there
are
better
choices
on
the
market
a
real
straight
forward
but
solid
marzen
good
one
to
know
about
not
bad
but
nothing
special
o
not
really
much
to
say
about
it
its
not
bad
but
not
exciting
a
safe
beer
for
a
crowd
no
wow
factor
can
be
found
here
a
real
easy
drinker
to
me
this
would
be
a
perfect
oktoberfest
bier
because
of
its
sessionable
qualities
the
appearance
is
fully
clear
pumpkin
flesh
orange
with
an
obvious
amber
malt
glow
and
a
fluffy
and
patient
bone
white
head
the
nose
is
caramunich
malts
as
it
should
be
with
only
moderate
sweetness
and
a
really
really
creamy
texture
that
slides
effortlessly
down
the
gullet
one
swig
after
another
theres
also
a
slight
fruity
complexion
to
the
yeast
but
its
tame
and
it
too
gives
way
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
which
is
less
amber
than
it
looked
and
more
caramel
and
classically
german
i
could
drink
this
forever
its
medium
in
body
but
feels
lighter
because
if
its
gentle
glide
it
also
has
fairly
relaxed
carbonation
which
lets
the
heft
of
the
body
remain
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
fall
beer
which
stays
approriate
in
the
winter
too
this
is
one
of
the
best
regular
beer
on
at
gordon
biersch
by
far
i
thought
only
4
bucksish
during
happy
hour
how
can
you
beat
that
id
buy
this
is
a
6pack
if
i
could
a
pretty
decent
marzen
i
think
i
could
drink
a
pile
of
these
overall
this
has
more
hop
bitterness
in
a
marzen
than
i
am
used
to
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
a
classic
flavorful
maltforward
brew
with
a
surprising
balance
and
flavor
that
keeps
you
sipping
until
your
next
pint
very
interesting
and
complex
upon
close
scrutiny
yet
as
a
whole
is
very
welcoming
and
approachable
that
just
about
anyone
can
appreciate
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
the
perfect
session
beer
great
brew
a
real
treat
and
one
of
my
favorite
amber
lagers
to
date
this
is
one
of
the
most
authentic
renditions
of
märzens
ive
had
since
my
visit
to
germany
theres
complexity
for
sure
but
theres
a
relaxing
vibe
about
it
overall
that
makes
it
a
crowd
pleaser
for
just
about
anyone
even
people
who
arent
fans
of
beer
as
experience
has
shown
me
in
the
past
goes
good
with
most
food
but
particularly
would
be
good
cooked
with
pork
or
steak
excellent
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
patches
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
bread
and
some
slight
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
straightforward
and
drinkable
gordon
biersch
is
probably
the
only
brewery
whose
flagship
beer
is
a
marzen
but
this
is
a
good
thing
for
them
its
an
incredibly
smooth
roasty
beer
just
sweet
enough
perfectly
enjoyable
at
any
occasion
and
dont
wait
until
october
to
try
it
because
they
have
festbier
waiting
for
you
then
ive
never
had
a
marzen
with
a
particularly
amazing
nose
but
this
one
does
ok
those
roasty
malts
can
only
indicate
happiness
to
come
this
is
one
of
the
best
marzens
ive
had
to
date
review
from
102010
notes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
orange
amber
with
a
light
offwhite
head
light
malt
and
dark
fruit
aroma
flavor
is
light
to
medium
dark
fruits
and
malt
with
light
hop
presence
a
nice
american
made
marzen
and
a
pleasant
dinner
beer
the
maerzen
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
standard
gordon
biersch
beers
it
sticks
to
the
style
while
delivering
decent
flavor
and
drinkability
a
goto
if
youre
at
a
gordon
biersch
o
really
good
beer
slightly
hopper
than
the
european
marzens
ive
had
very
good
especially
for
beer
available
on
an
airplane
overall
a
good
marzen
overall
ill
admit
naivety
when
it
comes
to
marzen
beers
i
dont
think
i
could
count
on
half
a
hand
the
number
of
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
certainly
drinkable
but
not
so
enjoyable
that
id
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
copper
amber
with
little
to
no
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
form
a
ring
around
the
outer
edge
and
a
small
archipelago
on
top
crisp
and
clear
with
no
haze
whatsoever
smells
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
notes
of
raisin
overpowered
by
caramel
and
syrup
smells
smooth
and
not
as
sweet
as
expected
full
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
moderate
upfront
sweetness
that
hints
at
brown
sugar
and
molassas
easy
to
drink
light
excellent
for
the
style
no
bitterness
on
the
finish
leaves
behind
a
bit
of
a
piney
taste
overall
a
great
beer
this
was
one
of
the
more
complex
marzen
offerings
ive
had
to
date
the
high
quality
standards
of
gb
were
definitely
showcased
in
this
offering
the
higher
abv
was
also
interesting
given
that
most
marsens
are
brewed
as
session
beers
overall
impression
wow
super
close
to
the
original
marzens
from
munchen
highly
suggest
would
like
to
enjoy
more
from
this
brewery
a
bit
pricey
at
the
airport
an
easy
drinking
nice
tasting
take
on
the
marzen
style
could
easily
bang
down
six
of
these
in
short
order
an
anytime
of
year
brew
o
not
a
very
impressive
marzen
i
enjoy
the
style
but
this
one
is
by
no
means
world
class
the
offering
from
several
other
breweries
are
much
better
wonder
if
this
is
better
on
tap
o
had
this
on
tap
at
raleigh
durham
airport
made
the
time
go
quickly
a
traditional
marzen
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
overall
i
cant
remember
when
i
had
this
last
but
i
reviewed
it
well
last
time
and
maybe
better
this
time
just
a
solid
marzen
and
yearround
i
believe
awesome
very
well
done
overall
it
was
one
of
the
better
offerings
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
it
above
average
but
still
a
good
beer
probably
their
signature
beer
but
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
it
their
seasonal
beers
are
usually
their
best
my
pour
resulted
in
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
rich
and
malty
very
caramellike
in
its
intensity
the
head
was
so
longlasting
that
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
disrupt
it
so
i
allowed
it
to
fall
on
its
own
leaving
some
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
rich
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
that
might
have
been
to
much
for
me
on
most
nights
but
it
was
tasting
pretty
daggum
good
tonight
finish
remained
very
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
extreme
finish
and
i
know
that
i
would
generally
shun
something
like
this
but
half
the
glass
was
empty
just
while
i
typed
nice
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
a
nice
marzen
amber
styled
beer
for
anyone
looking
to
move
on
from
coors
and
pabst
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
gordon
biersch
o
very
impressive
marzen
a
style
i
enjoy
but
have
never
been
blown
away
this
one
comes
close
o
decent
marzen
style
beer
and
great
crisp
flavor
combined
with
its
medium
body
overall
i
liked
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
find
them
more
in
my
area
overall
drinkability
bottle
is
probably
past
its
prime
as
is
offers
no
redeeming
qualities
and
has
too
man
prominent
offcharacters
to
be
either
a
session
or
a
tasting
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
to
date
it
has
a
very
bready
flavor
to
it
i
would
put
this
in
the
top
10
of
marzens
i
have
tried
o
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
marzen
not
a
ton
going
on
but
some
caramel
and
bready
malts
but
nice
for
the
style
and
something
i
would
order
again
probably
the
best
of
their
beers
i
had
that
night
dr
its
pretty
drinkable
you
could
down
it
quickly
all
night
no
alcohol
comes
through
but
at
this
abv
thats
not
difficult
to
accomplish
id
try
it
on
draught
but
its
nothing
special
it
does
compete
with
most
german
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
but
those
were
brewed
mainly
for
festivals
this
is
usally
my
staple
brew
when
going
to
gordon
biersch
with
the
wife
for
dinner
it
is
a
nice
smooth
taste
with
a
nice
deep
amber
color
in
the
glass
this
beer
goes
great
with
the
steak
frites
which
is
steak
cut
up
over
fries
with
a
marzen
based
sauce
poured
over
top
wash
that
down
with
a
marzen
and
you
will
be
set
for
the
night
had
the
marzen
at
the
g
b
in
bolingbrook
il
last
evening
the
color
was
a
nice
copperamber
with
white
head
that
laced
slightly
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
hints
of
malt
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balance
of
grain
hops
and
malt
the
was
a
slight
sweetness
that
made
the
beer
smooth
to
drink
and
the
beer
came
off
the
pallet
clean
overall
not
to
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
good
session
beer
where
a
bit
more
dryness
and
hop
influence
is
preferred
this
marzen
is
sure
to
satisfy
the
sweet
tooth
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bold
goldrust
color
with
34
head
and
some
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
hints
of
plumb
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
has
caramel
and
molasses
notes
with
a
faint
hints
of
spice
toast
shows
up
in
the
finish
its
got
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
great
with
pretzels
gordon
biersch
marzen
is
a
good
beer
a
decent
example
of
the
style
recommended
this
beer
gives
me
a
new
respect
for
gordon
biersch
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
auburn
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
ahint
of
caramel
taste
is
also
malty
slightly
sweet
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
poured
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
was
toasty
nutty
light
grainy
taste
of
toasted
bread
sweet
malts
very
mildly
hopped
standard
märzen
profile
nothing
too
interesting
going
on
a
little
on
the
lightwatery
side
but
not
too
bad
and
fairly
drinkable
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
beer
that
gb
makes
the
first
is
still
the
swarz
overall
a
good
marzen
good
full
body
nice
touches
of
spice
very
drinkable
o
its
a
nice
refreshing
beer
not
to
sweet
to
start
not
to
bitter
to
finish
something
i
would
certainly
purchase
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
makes
a
great
octoberfest
beer
this
dark
and
deep
amber
colored
beer
is
very
clear
it
pours
with
a
very
thin
head
a
very
light
aroma
of
malt
leads
one
to
expect
the
beer
will
be
very
light
however
one
taste
tells
you
that
this
is
not
the
case
this
dry
beer
is
full
bodied
with
strong
flavors
of
toasted
malt
had
it
at
the
sacremento
airport
nice
and
simple
every
day
beer
notes
overall
this
is
a
solid
american
take
on
the
style
moderate
to
fullbodied
and
well
balanced
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
damn
tasty
had
this
on
tap
at
the
gordon
biersch
in
virginia
beach
color
is
a
good
copper
shade
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
dissipated
at
a
fair
rate
and
left
some
lacing
smell
was
bready
but
rather
light
taste
was
good
malty
bready
earthy
and
a
slight
sweetness
aftertaste
was
unremarkable
but
not
offensive
the
beer
wasnt
too
heavy
but
wasnt
very
light
either
it
hit
a
nice
middle
ground
overall
this
was
a
nice
marzen
nothing
spectacular
but
it
was
well
done
and
i
would
have
some
of
it
again
o
its
a
decent
marzen
3

from
a

poured
into
a

its
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
good
clarity
and
minor
carbonation
streams
pleasant
nose
with
buttery
diacetyl
notes
nuts
and
heavy
sweet

in
the
mouth
it
tastes
as
the
nose
advertises
malt
heavy
with
toffee
and
hops
notes
slightly
flat
and
watery
overall
its
a
decent
beer
a
few
steps
above
average
but
nothing
either
extreme
or
especially
mellow
sessionable
i
could
drink
several
for
sure
but
nothing
id
seek
out
worth
a
try
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
good
inch
of
foamy
off
whit
head
head
reduces
down
to
a
mere
ring
around
the
edge
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
fairly
muted
mostly
caramel
malt
and
some
faint
grassy
hops
flavor
is
a
bit
more
developed
caramel
malt
some
light
citrus
hops
a
mild
bitterness
and
an
earthy
finish
feel
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
but
very
clean
tasting
overall
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
dthis
one
was
pretty
enjoyable
but
it
was
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
for
a
marzen
served
in
the
wrong
glassware
o
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
really
special
im
thinking
this
would
have
been
better
on
tap
a
good
beer
waiting
for
an
airplane
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
touch
more
oa
solid
rendition
of
the
style
o
very
good
i
can
see
why
this
in
one
of
their
most
popular
offerings
this
is
a
decent
simple
malty
lager
that
i
would
certainly
come
back
to
when
offered
alongside
bmctype
tap
offerings
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
with
no
real
faults
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
german
lagers
and
trapped
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ocean
d
yes
yes
yes
go
get
one
d
refreshing
and
solid
brew
easily
drinkable
and
quite
sessionable
very
rich
malty
character
was
an
enjoyment
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
at
a
local
bar
in
west
palm
beach
which
is
where
i
live
this
beer
had
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
finger
and
a
half
inch
head
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
the
biggest
surprise
it
was
very
good
i
generally
drink
only
ipas
but
this
marzen
was
worth
writing
about
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
everyone
drinkability
this
is
definitley
a
session
beer
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
night
im
thoroughly
impressed
with
how
welldefined
how
expertlystylistically
distinguishable
the
flavors
are
tune
in
next
time
to
track
the
development
of
my
swooning
ive
had
this
in
my
kegerator
in
the
past
and
it
didnt
disappoint
there
either
average
really
but
not
to
be
undersold
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
pours
a
clean
reddishcopper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
has
a
subtle
sweetmalty
smell
really
get
the
hops
and
a
grainy
taste
it
has
a
pretty
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
really
enjoyed
this
brew
the
beer
had
a
cloudy
amberorange
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
with
moderate
retention
the
aroma
was
maltdominated
with
caramel
highlights
and
some
lighter
yeasty
and
citrus
tones
flavor
was
mildly
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
was
mostly
malty
it
was
a
slightly
wet
beer
with
a
drier
finish
average
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
the
beer
was
ok
but
nothing
too
be
remembered
d
very
nicely
balanced
and
slightly
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
was
probably
one
of
my
favorites
at
the
restaurant
it
was
an
excellent
marzen
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
ok
d
a
decent
brew
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
sampled
at
gordon
biersch
restaurant
in
dallas
tx
pours
copper
hue
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
body
is
medium
smooth
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
up
front
and
then
earthy
hops
kick
in
to
balance
long
malty
finish
on
the
whole
it
is
nice
marzen
overall
an
ok
marzen
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
good
one
either
mouthfeel
is
way
overcarbonated
leaving
a
fizzy
impact
that
hurts
the
profile
of
an
otherwise
solid
beer
body
is
a
bit
light
but
it
is
otherwise
smooth
with
little
palate
impact
if
this
had
lower
carbonation
it
would
be
less
filling
and
the
drinkability
would
score
higher
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
dark
malts
and
thats
about
it
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
oktoberfest
beers
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
least
flavorful
ones
that
i
have
had
d
good
brew
reminds
me
of
similar
ones
from
germany
i
just
looked
down
and
noticed
im
drinking
this
beer
fast
so
i
guess
that
goes
for
something
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
shortest
reviews
ive
written
im
finding
this
brew
completely
uninspiring
pours
a
goldencopper

a

a
tasty
drinkable
beer
neither
offensive
nor
particularly
good
id
have
it
again
but
there
are
a
number
of
others
id
choose
first
still
this
exceeded
my
expectations
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
the
flavors
are
not
strong
but
are
well
done
for
a
mazen
that
is
on
the
malty
side
rjt
d
very
drinkable
on
of
the
better
amercan
marzenfests
out
there
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
caramel
taste
and
after
taste
a
good
classic
marzen
offering
from
gb
that
is
perfect
for
a
cool
fall
afternoon
or
evening
because
of
the
strong
caramel
flavor
this
is
not
great
for
drinking
in
significant
quantity
but
is
great
if
you
are
interested
in
having
one
or
two
d
very
drinkable
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
while
chilling
and
was
able
to
convert
a
budsciple
to
drink
this
instead
appearance
is
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
head
that
dissapates
leaving
no
lace
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
light
in
dark
fruits
taste
has
that
sweet
maltiness
grainy
and
balanced
well
with
the
low
hop
but
having
a
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
gordon
biersch
seems
to
make
good
on
the
german
styles
drink
is
excellent
i
was
crazing
this
today
overall
a
very
excellent
beer
from
a
company
that
does
get
overlooked
quite
a
bit
i
dont
notice
anything
sticking
out
wrt
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
and
thickness
seem
to
be
on
point
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
subtle
lager
that
you
can
quaff
for
an
entire
session
this
is
probably
gordon
bierschs
best
beer
darn
nice
pours
a
splendidly
clear
amber
orange
offwhite
ringy
head
plenty
of
carb
trails
smell
is
crisp
and
fresh
almost
a
light
vanillafloral
quality
hard
to
pin
down
taste
is
mild
for
a
märzen
good
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
toasted
nuttiness
as
well
as
alcohol
finishes
pleasantly
bitter
feel
is
active
and
soapy
drinkability
average
for
the
style
but
a
decent
brew
in
all
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
but
not
ridiculously
so
d
i
found
this
goes
quick
and
well
with
many
different
foods
d
weak
watery
thin
these
are
the
words
that
best
describe
gb
marzen
avoid
if
possible
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
marzen
it
appears
to
be
their
signature
brew
top
notch
comparable
to
the
greats
from
overseas
d
i
first
had
this
beer
in
san
diego
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
astringent
usually
its
been
a
very
malty
beer
but
maybe
my
palate
has
become
more
sensitive
to
these
kinds
of
things
while
usually
i
enjoy
this
beer
this
particular
pint
just
wasnt
my
pint
of
beer
d
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
quite
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
d
very
drinkable
i
could
quaff
a
sixer
with
pretzels
other
salty
snacks
for
sure
i
think
id
buy
again
for
a
toss
back
beer
but
its
nothing
exciting
to
me
i
would
of
liked
more
malt
character
in
the
flavor
not
bad
for
the
price
though
but
id
look
elsewhere
for
a
richer
malt
profile
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
simple
brew
that
you
a
can
knock
back
with
your
buddies
while
they
drink
that
other
stuff
marzenoktoberfest
is
a
style
im
just
realizing
is
really
tasty
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
ill
be
trying
more
this
fall
d
very
drinkable
this
large
glass
is
disappearing
pretty
quickly
unfortunately
i
dont
have
time
for
another
comments
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
probably
would
not
reach
for
another
considering
some
of
the
other
options
that
can
be
found
within
this
style
overall
honestly
this
is
the
first
märzen
ive
tried
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
this
beer
shows
a
lot
of
promise
for
this
style
d
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
great
beer
now
its
average
if
its
at
a
party
ill
drink
it
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
the
mouth
is
thinner
than
id
like
could
stand
a
bite
more
depth
here
wellrounded
flavors
with
a
sweet
finish
mild
bitterness
this
beer
surely
hits
the
spot
i
love
that
this
offering
is
offered
yearround
so
i
can
get
my
marzen
fix
without
waiting
for
autumn
good
stuff
yet
again
bland
and
generic
a
by
the
books
version
of
a
marzen
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
ive
been
working
my
way
through
a
case
with
great
enjoyment
pours
a
bright
amber
transparent
sinopia
with
a
dissipating
head
this
isnt
the
prettiest
style
on
the
block
but
this
beer
is
pretty
spoton
in
my
rather
limited
märzen
experience
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
closer
to
the
cheap
stuff
filling
candy
bars
but
still
pleasing
bit
of
a
rumlike
note
as
well
maybe
a
bit
of
euro
hops
of
some
sort
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
i
expected
less
to
be
honest
and
i
bet
this
beer
is
even
better
fresh
from
a
keg
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
slick
but
i
dont
really
mind
ive
never
been
a
huge
märzen
fan
but
this
is
one
is
definitely
better
and
probably
truer
to
style
than
many
american
versions
taste
bland
and
boring
would
be
too
harsh
but
not
anywhere
near
exciting
you
know
they
roasted
a
decent
amount
of
malt
little
hopping
unadventurous
their
garlic
fries
are
bomb
though
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
to
rate
drinkability
wise
tried
this
at
the
city
paper
brew
festival
here
in
baltimore
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
but
both
their
marzen
and
maibock
were
very
good
the
marzen
was
very
malty
smooth
as
i
would
expect
thin
in
mouthfeel
very
little
carbonation
very
drinkable
d
expected
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
but
it
wasnt
all
together
bad
pretty
average
the
flavor
is
rich
and
bready
with
a
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
butterscotch
the
finish
has
a
small
hop
flavor
in
it
thats
very
similar
to
a
pilsner
and
seeing
as
theyre
both
lagers
this
makes
sense
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
i
admit
to
having
reservations
about
gordon
biersch
based
on
their
being
like
taco
mac
and
other
chains
but
this
is
a
good
and
decent
marzen
and
well
worth
the
dollar
a
bottle
price
nicely
colored
amber
brew
with
something
of
a
grainy
nose
and
taste
sweet
with
caramel
malts
some
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
spice
but
theres
something
off
a
sort
of
hollowness
to
the
taste
and
a
chalkiness
in
the
light
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
have
mistaken
it
for
a
classic
german
märzen
but
i
might
still
drink
it
again
a
good
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
malt
rather
typical
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bready
malt
with
a
light
hop
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
decent
nothing
spectacular
very
drinkable
this
is
one
i
truly
dont
want
to
put
down
5
7
abv
isnt
too
high
but
for
oktoberfeststyle
sessioning
it
can
catch
up
quickly
and
i
imagine
that
the
rich
maltiness
would
also
become
a
little
cloying
after
just
a
few
a
little
higher
hopping
rate
would
help
that
out
but
as
it
is
its
still
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
made
even
better
by
being
a
yearround
brew
not
really
that
impressive
but
a
decent
brew
overall
drinkability
a
strange
flavor
without
much
complexity
or
depth
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
like
this
beer
its
consistent
and
goes
well
with
the
food
gb
serves
it
pours
with
a
nice
head
ill
give
some
credit
to
the
bartender
who
knew
actually
how
to
pour
a
lager
the
golden
brown
amber
color
looked
nice
and
clear
the
malty
aroma
was
nice
but
not
over
powering
and
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
seemed
a
little
forced
with
carbonization
but
not
bad
i
would
happily
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
compared
to
the
festbier
this
is
less
balanced
a
bit
cloying
and
much
fuller
bodied
all
of
which
reduce
the
drinkability
i
must
say
this
is
a
decent
quality
beer
definitely
not
a
standalone
brew
if
you
get
one
of
these
have
it
with
a
meal
the
food
complements
an
otherwise
unremarkable
beer
dark
amber
one
finger
head
quick
dissipation
with
above
average
lacing
malt
dominated
nose
bready
over
sweet
with
quite
a
bit
of
piney
hops
present
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
more
than
sweetness
syrupy
not
much
hops
in
the
taste
or
on
the
backend
malts
become
more
dominant
as
the
beer
warms
up
with
sweetness
coming
to
forefront
nice
carbonation
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
a
farily
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
came
in
a
really
cool
plastic
bottle
that
i
have
never
seen
before
this
was
a
very
pleasant
marzen
with
very
good
drinkability
and
decent
malt
and
hop
profile
on
the
darker
side
of
the
style
i
was
reminded
of
negro
modelo
at
times
though
i
found
the
mouthfeel
on
the
thicker
side
with
the
limited
amount
of
marzens
available
year
round
in
bc
this
is
a
nice
find
that
i
will
purchase
again
decent
easy
drinking
brew
i
really
enjoy
this
one
when
im
enjoying
more
than
one
notes
like
many
of
the
other
gb
beers
it
is
a
solid
correct
version
of
a
traditional
german
style
however
also
like
other
gb
beers
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
its
a
solid
beer
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
endearing
qualities
drinkability
very
mild
for
an
oktoberfest
but
that
mildness
does
lend
this
brew
to
a
nice
bit
of
drinkability
that
being
said
this
brew
is
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
taste
ive
had
worse
oktoberfests
but
there
are
plenty
out
there
that
are
better
got
it
in
a
gordon
biersch
mixer
amber
beer
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
leaving
no
lacing
and
a
touch
of
film
nose
is
spicy
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
grain
super
mild
really
very
little
going
on
here
aromawise
flavor
is
similar
if
a
touch
stronger
similar
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
dirty
earth
flavor
some
grain
carbonation
is
fine
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
very
mediocre
not
offensive
just
not
particularly
good
drinkability
ok
have
had
better
marzens
but
it
was
ok
just
average
overall
i
like
it
although
the
body
is
somewhat
lacking
drinkability
a
decent
acceptable
lil
ofest
with
just
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
hoppiness
and
overall
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
one
worth
trying
d
an
ok
marzen
there
is
certainly
worse
out
there
but
certainly
better
its
not
bad
and
not
all
that
good
either
better
than
a
macro
and
i
would
drink
another
one
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
seek
it
out
quite
drinkable
i
was
surprised
actually
this
is
the
first
gordon
biersch
beer
ive
tried
and
it
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
oktoberfest
in
particular
it
pairs
very
nicely
with
food
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
im
sure
youd
want
another
d
very
drinkable
this
was
a
pretty
good
one
for
an
american
version
of
the
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
for
the
style
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
good
a
little
metallic
but
overall
not
bad
im
sure
this
review
suffered
because
i
had
a
hacker
pshorr
first
but
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
the
gordon
biersch
marzen
has
an
auburn
tint
to
it
overall
it
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
it
is
a
mediumhopped
lager
with
a
mildly
sweet
taste
to
it
the
marzen
is
the
most
popular
beer
at
the
rockville
location
and
understandably
so
if
you
are
at
a
gb
make
sure
you
give
this
one
a
try
smooth
and
creamy
mildly
carbonated
nutty
and
not
too
malty
with
some
caramel
apple
slight
hop
back
just
enough
to
give
it
character
could
drink
quarts
of
it
a
nice
little
beer
not
great
but
if
the
price
is
right
i
got
this
one
free
i
will
buy
more
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
not
terribly
creamy
overall
not
bad
but
this
beer
is
significantly
better
ontap
at
the
plano
restaurant
bottled
version
is
much
sweeter
and
only
shows
a
bit
of
characteristic
toastiness
you
would
expect
in
the
future
ill
stick
to
the
tap
ive
felt
nothing
but
disappointment
with
gordon
biersch
brews
rathertap
drinkability
drinkable
en
masse
but
its
not
a
stand
alone
goes
well
with
their
food
d
very
drinkable
good
sesson
lager
d
not
bad
but
not
great
either
overall
pretty
average
for
a
marzen
gordon
biersch
makes
a
good
marzen
beer
it
is
available
all
year
round
at
your
local
safeway
it
is
easy
to
pick
out
of
the
crowd
with
its
red
label
in
my
experience
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
the
brew
looks
gorgeous
filling
up
my
extra
large
pintsized
glass
d
quite
nice
overall
with
a
complex
and
enjoyable
malt
character
my
only
complaint
is
the
dryness
in
the
finish
which
makes
the
toasted
character
seem
excessive
and
diminishes
the
richness
of
the
malt
not
that
i
should
but
id
compare
this
iteration
of
the
lager
style
to
a
cleaner
amber
ale
one
with
less
depth
of
flavor
d
even
though
the
taste
is
mild
this
is
highly
drinkable
bier
could
have
the
whole
6pack
without
an
issue
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
high
quality
marzen
look
somewhere
else
i
will
have
this
again
though
not
bad
prosit
d
another
really
nice
beer
from
gb
very
german
earmarks
fresh
and
tasty
ill
be
getting
more
the
aroma
is
dusty
malty
and
corn
like
malt
and
floral
hops
the
appearance
is
orange
gold
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
a
nice
tasting
beer
that
is
a
bit
thin
and
weak
i
wish
this
one
had
more
substance
i
really
want
to
like
this
one
had
this
on
tap
at
gordon
biersch
in
dc
poured
a
rusty
orange
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
left
that
remained
as
a
slight
skim
on
the
top
and
some
lacing
not
much
nose
though
i
did
detect
a
very
slight
fruit
scent
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
was
somewhat
tingly
led
to
fairly
weak
fruit
taste
not
real
impressed
with
the
finish
as
it
was
short
and
a
tad
skunky
amber
crystal
clear
with
a
healthy
head
but
no
lace
lots
of
carbonation
is
present
the
aroma
is
definitely
malty
the
first
taste
reveals
a
medium
to
medheavy
body
brew
sweet
in
the
middle
and
finish
i
found
it
underhopped
for
my
tastes
and
sweet
to
the
point
of
cloying
m
d
medium
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
balance
if
the
odd
sweet
notes
in
the
flavour
and
aroma
were
toned
down
i
think
i
would
find
this
much
more
enjoyable
worth
checking
into
though
i
dont
know
if
id
be
after
it
again
personally
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
decanted
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
very
small
white
head
aromas
are
pretty
onenote
very
bready
some
dark
fruit
flavors
are
singularly
bready
with
a
few
sour
notes
not
a
lot
of
dynamic
character
mouthfeel
is
decent
appropriate
for
the
style
an
easily
drinkable
beer
just
not
a
lot
of
character
to
it
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
orangecopper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
the
nose

i
taste

a
hint
of
smoke
crisp
hop
finish
buttery
and
smooth

a
fairly
decent
brew
d
this
beer
is
a

very
drinkable
and
sessionable

it
will
be
a
good
one
to
give
to

not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
it
get
little
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweetnes
a
tad
bitter
hops
nothing
really
stands
out
though
okay
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
about
would
much
rather
have
sam
adams
octoberfest
any
day
could
also
bet
that
its
february
and
maybe
need
to
get
it
again
when
it
comes
back
in
season
enjoyed
at
the
miami
brewpub
a
marzen
in
februarywhy
not
their
most
popular
beer
at
this
location
according
to
the
trainer
and
maybe
the
best
of
the
day
smoke
cloudy
colour
with
a
minimum
white
head
and
faint
lace
served
way
too
cold
but
still
a
good
malting
and
fruity
i
have
been
to
several
gordons
seattle
sf
vegas
dc
and
everytime
i
get
this
beer
had
it
on
tap
and
bottle
but
bottle
kind
of
sucks
poured
a
nice
deep
auburn
with
a
smaller
than
most
of
this
styles
head
a
half
inch
tan
pillow
and
thats
it
nose
is
malty
sweet
and
sour
candylike
taste
is
well
balanced
and
the
body
is
solid
with
a
sweet
malted
caramel
greats
you
while
a
mild
hop
comes
through
to
crisp
the
rear
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
pretty
good
märzen
its
nicely
malty
sweet
and
thick
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
red
auburn
with
not
much
head
it
has
very
subtle
aromas
which
are
dominated
by
a
sweet
almost
sugary
smell
taste
is
dry
and
a
mildly
hoppy
on
the
finish
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
but
overall
very
easy
to
drink
opinion
well
i
have
been
drinking
a
whole
lot
of
paulaner
oktoberfest
here
this
season
and
this
beer
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
like
that
one
oktoberfest
styles
are
rather
subtle
with
a
delicate
mix
between
the
different
flavors
they
can
be
mistaken
as
mild
but
if
you
think
about
what
you
are
tasting
it
is
like
a
milkshake
this
beer
doesnt
do
that
for
me
it
is
ok
but
the
hops
and
crystal
are
out
of
balance
to
let
the
toasty
malts
shine
through
it
is
an
alright
beer
and
i
would
certainly
take
it
above
a
whole
lot
of
others
and
i
would
even
like
to
try
it
again
on
tap
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
like
i
do
a
whole
lot
of
others
this
beer
has
a
nice
copper
color
and
a
moderate
head
on
top
of
it
though
it
fades
within
a
minute
or
so
the
nose
is
rather
grainy
for
a
marzen
though
theres
an
adequate
maltiness
in
the
nose
the
flavor
has
a
very
light
toastiness
but
is
pretty
bland
for
a
marzen
maltwise
better
on
draft
at
the
local
gb
than
it
is
in
the
bottle

this
poured
a
clear
brownish
ruby
with
a
little
white
head
it
smelled
like
malt
and
some
mild
hops
it
tasted
like
roasted
malt
with
some
bitterness
it
was
watery
and
had
a
little
carbonation
with
a
sour
aftertaste
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
lager
sourness
so
overall
id
just
say
this
wasnt
bad
although
it
did
taste
more
like
a
standard
ale
than
anything
it
is
watery
and
i
will
not
buy
it
again
not
a
good
representation
of
a
marzen
id
pass
on
this
one
d
not
great
but
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweet
beer
the
taste
is
caramelly
grain
with
a
creamsoda
hint
its
a
bit
on
the
alcoholic
side
smooth
but
light
and
spritzy
its
a
little
too
sweet
uncomplicated
and
onedimensional
and
a
bit
flat
the
finish
is
rather
short
and
flat
with
almost
no
aftertaste
aside
from
a
barely
noticeable
hint
of
grain
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
terrible
but
also
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
just
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
a
dark
copper
brew
is
covered
by
a
twofinger
rolling
tan
head
that
fades
in
a
somewhat
slow
manner
and
leaves
very
litte
lacing
not
much
on
the
nose
maybe
some
malts
and
spice
tastes
of
malts
a
very
subtle
essence
of
caramel
and
not
much
more
has
plenty
of
carbonation
and
d
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
nothing
special
here
the
fourth
in
the
line
of
the
6x
sampler
at
the
rockville
restaurant
and
the
one
that
those
with
me
thanks
n
e
ordered
individually
easily
the
most
drinkable
of
the
bunch
nice
hazy
orange
in
the
glass
with
a
significant
head
of
tan
foam
that
laced
fairly
well
throughout
all
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
same
in
the
taste
with
just
a
touch
of
residual
bitterness
thrown
in
to
make
it
soft
on
the
palate
extremely
drinkable
and
if
one
werent
careful
the
one
gb
offering
that
would
never
be
cloying
and
could
easily
be
enjoyed
all
night
long
i
have
a
feeling
the
abv
would
sneak
up
on
you
after
awhile
offering
a
true
oktoberfest
experience
d
i
like
the
roasty
toastednut
flavors
in
this
beer
and
it
is
usually
my
goto
beer
in
this
place
decently
good
not
a
bad
beer
easy
to
drink
is
it
just
me
or
is
this
beer
simply
boring
after
sampling
a
couple
of
these
im
tempted
to
drink
the
rest
just
to
free
up
some
real
estate
in
my
beer
fridge
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
slight
amber
tint
large
head
that
quickly
settles
down
to
a
minimal
along
with
minimal
lacing
looks
ok
but
then
i
close
in
to
smell
this
beer
and
i
get
nothing
a
little
closer
and
i
am
able
to
detect
a
faint
presence
of
sweet
malt
and
nothing
else
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
borders
on
thin
finish
is
sticky
and
undesireable
the
flavor
is
weak
and
unimpressive
nothing
too
good
worth
writing
about
overall
i
really
dont
care
for
this
beer
i
bought
it
on
sale
and
i
still
overpaid
overall
a
nice
high
abv
session
beer
d
out
of
the
previous
3
g
b
beers
ive
had
this
is
the
best
so
far
would
come
back
to
this
one
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
always
enjoyable
general
impression
a
bit
rough
but
overall
a
good
call
cheers
drinkability
smooth
and
clean
currently
the
most
affordable
craft
beer
outside
of
trader
joes
in
the
neighborhood
i
cant
complain
about
that
also
seems
to
be
an
excellent
style
example
for
a
marzen
i
will
revisit
it
again
quite
often
overdone
gbs
maerzen
is
neither
to
thin
nor
too
malty
sweet
and
hits
the
mark
right
on
add
to
that
that
its
very
well
made
and
youve
got
a
very
drinkable
lager
thats
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
beyond
one
serving
and
also
pairs
well
with
food
worth
trying
d
the
malt
flavors
are
nice
but
they
are
behind
all
the
carbonic
acid
finish
they
taste
fresh
but
their
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
to
them
nothing
too
complex
but
certainly
above
average
theres
a
slight
metallic
note
i
could
do
without
however
eric
overall
not
bad
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
a
little
bit
sweet
but
it
sure
beat
the
hell
of
the
bmc
that
are
in
most
airport
bars
this
was
an
average
marzen
that
was
quite
good
to
have
while
on
a
ski
break
amber
hue
with
intentionally
no
head
poured
from
the
server
balanced
malt
nuttiness
and
slight
spicy
hop
parallel
the
aroma
and
flavor
slight
creamy
mouthfeel
drank
one
and
was
headed
back
for
the
slopes
glad
i
bought
this
instead
of
a
lousy
10
hamburger
d
it
is
drinkable
i
love
the
color
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
d
i
wasnt
running
back
for
more
but
its
easy
to
drink
not
bad
this
is
the
best
pubbrewery
beer
i
have
ever
drank
in
a
restaurant
chain
overall
an
easy
session
beer
not
as
good
as
their
hefe
but
tasty
clean
copper
body
with
tight
blonde
head
modest
malt
presence
detectable
in
aroma
taste
brings
out
a
little
spice
but
mostly
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
german
hops
clean
mouthfeel
but
heavy
modest
flavor
profile
doesnt
lend
itself
well
to
drinkability
a
copper
color
with
ruby
tints
and
a
decent
head
and
lace
patches
a
weak
smell
considering
the
style
there
are
some
hops
noticeable
but
no
spices
jump
out
no
fruit
no
caramel
or
whatever
you
might
find
in
a
marzen
the
taste
is
rather
thin
with
minimal
hops
and
a
few
peppers
that
goes
down
the
gullet
slick
it
is
an
alright
brew
but
i
expected
more
on
this
one
d
this
is
an
alright
brew
usually
the
good
stuff
at
most
bbqs
tap
at
the
gordon
biersch
brewery
in
s
f
golden
amber
rich
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
held
up
for
a
while
lightly
malty
caramel
honey
nutty
flavors
with
some
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
rich
flavorful
balanced
and
a
good
beer
i
thought
only
one
i
ordered
after
sampling
all
of
their
beers
d
decent
on
the
drinkabilty
scale
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
this
one
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
this
but
rather
not
if
something
better
was
available
not
my
favorite
marzen
but
wanted
to
try
because
i
have
not
have
many
gordon
biersch
before
recommended
next
october
if
it
is
the
only
seasonal
on
the
shelf
at
that
time
but
i
would
probably
not
drink
this
one
again
good
beer
overall
could
be
kicked
up
a
little
more
in
a
couple
areas
to
make
it
great
but
good
nonetheless
bright
orange
in
appearance
with
a
thin
head
that
drops
doughy
malt
and
gingerbread
are
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
nonoffensive
but
nothing
spectacular
to
note
it
has
a
sweet
taste
of
a
blend
of
different
malts
moderate
hop
bitterness
then
kicks
in
to
balance
out
the
flavor
this
brew
is
adequately
carbonated
but
has
a
thinner
feel
to
it
granted
all
this
i
could
happily
knock
down
a
few
of
these
and
be
satisfied
a
surprisingly
balanced
beer
and
its
served
year
round
much
more
enjoyable
than
many
of
the
seasonal
fest
beers
from
the
metoo
crowd
if
only
it
didnt
cost
so
damn
much
at
6

head
smelled

grape
esters
inviting
this
beer
had
kind
of
a
strange
flavor
arc
the
malts
hops
and
yeast
all
emerge
at
different
times
and
have
very
different
characteristics
the
sweet
malts
are
the
first
to
emerge
and
they
remain
mildly
intot
the
finish
the
hops
are
initially
overshadowed
by
the
bitter
yeastiness
unusual
for
the
style
but
as
it
fades
they
come
out
lightly
spicy
lightly
floral
fairly
nice
but
not
something
id
get
regularly
drinkability
its
worth
trying
once
drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
very
session
like
this
wont
blow
you
away
but
across
all
gordon
biersch
brewpubs
this
is
always
a
consistant
standard
offering
worth
having
served
on
draft
in
a
pint
glass
in
the
dc
location
appearance
was
dark
copper
with
hint
of
red
little
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
noble
hops
and
slight
maltcaramel
taste
was
reflective
of
the
aroma
starts
with
a
light
caramelmalt
flavor
and
ends
with
hop
bitterness
a
metallic
flavor
was
also
evident
mouthfeel
was
light
low
viscosity
compared
to
other
marzens
i
rate
drinkability
as
slightly
above
average
because
this
is
one
that
can
be
consumed
quite
a
bit
and
quite
easily
in
a
single
session
although
overall
this
marzen
seems
to
be
missing
the
rich
caramel
malt
flavor
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
from
safeway
in
eureka
at
8
29
a
six
pack
for
this
price
you
expect
something
special
it
poured
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
left
good
lacing
fairly
attractive
nose
was
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
llavors
of
malts
nice
finish
was
a
touch
of
sweetness
decent
brew
but
just
a
little
expensive
for
what
you
get
not
a
surprising
disappointment
considering
that
i
dislike
the
other
gordon
biersch
beers
ive
had
no
reason
to
get
this
again
considering
how
many
better
märzen
beers
there
are
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
rich
bronze
with
great
clarity
a
tight

12

with

a

somewhat
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
sweet
doughy
quality
with
hints
of
scotch
whiskey
finishing
with
just
a
touch
herbalspice
wow
pleasantly
suprised
i
really
liked
this
full
flavored
marzen
beer
nice
medium
body
and
enough
dryness
to
really
enjoy
in
amounts
mild
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
think
this
is
the
first
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
tried
it
was
milder
than
i
thought
but
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
the
color
was
a
nice
redish
brown
with
a
head
that
settled
fairly
quickly
the
taste
was
nutty
sweet
and
slightly
sour
hints
of
caramel
and
spice
came
through
and
possibly
grapefruit
as
well
would
have
this
again
as
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
light
in
the
mouth
could
maybe
have
had
a
bit
more
body
for
my
tastes
however
this
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
an
enjoyable
marzen
that
is
available
year
round
and
is
often
on
sale
at
the
grocery
store
neither
the
first
nor
last
time
i
will
drink
this
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
sour
candylike
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
the
body
is
solid
a
sweet
malted
caramel
greats
you
while
a
mild
hop
comes
through
to
crisp
the
rear
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
5

is
a
nice
touch
for
this
autumn
centered
brew
nice
job
gordon
well
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
could
like
it
was
the
middle
sampler
sweet
caramels
and
some
faint
with
low
hop
character
filling
could
use
better
malts

the

i
could
leave
a
bottle
of
weihenstephaner

or
any
other
weihenstephaner
beer
in
my
cars
back

for
a
month
and
it
would
still
taste
better
than
the
best
gordon

beers
its
a
shame
gb
hasnt
turned

corner

started
producing
really

seems
flat
and
low
in
carbonation
for
the
style
bottled
on
dec

tasted
on
april
4th
not
too
long
but
maybe
enough
so
the
beer
is
not
what
it
could
be
unlike
other
ryes
not
much
going
on
here
pours
darker
than
expected
with
a
rich
and
vibrant
dark
amber
body
under
light
foam
smells
and
tastes
true
to
style
without
being
quite
as
rich
and
luscious
as
some
examples
the
maltiness
is
less
than
expected
the
hops
more
especially
the
bitterness
overall
this
works
well
as
an
american
example
of
the
style
and
the
rye
is
a
very
well
done
component
as
usual
great
divide
delivers
a
bold
interpretation
with
professional
overall
good
representative
of
the
style
that
is
apparently
available
yearround
which
is
welcomed
by
me
very
refreshing
i
really
like
this
one
i
think
it
is
very
underrated
very
nice
refreshing
citrusy
aroma
from
the
beer
the
taste
like
other
reviewers
have
said
has
a
bit
of
a
caramel
and
strong
rye
taste
to
it
a
bit
sweet
my
only
complaint
is
the
finish
is
a
little
flat
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
the
reason
i
really
like
this
beer
is
its
great
balance
of
all
things
good
malt
rye
notes
hops
and
various
mild
background
flavors
but
not
dominated
by
any
one
thing
then
the
drinkability
puts
the
icing
on
the
cake
with
its
smoothness
and
subdued
bitterness
and
a
really
nice
clean
finish
tastes
watered
down
dissapointed
in
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
and
yet
feels
watery
with
mild
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
nice
malty
semidry
finish
that
trails
with
a
nice
combo
of
sweetness
and
spices
this
hides
the
abv
completely
and
was
easy
to
drink
i
really
like
this
version
of
a
märzenoktoberfest
and
will
definitely
have
it
again
pours

no

didnt
read
the

right
away
bready

and
a
bit
of

as
well
the
taste
features
sweet
very
lightly
roasted
malts
led
by
caramel
a
good
amount
of
bread
malts
as
well
and
some
grain
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
some
very
lightly
roasted
nuts
that
were
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
caramel
very
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
that
doesnt
go
overboard
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
sticky
with
makes
it
a
little
harder
to
gulp
down
overall
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
after
having
a
few
letdowns
from
great
divide
creamy
nutty
flavours
with
some
bready
malt
too
quite
sweet
what
an
unusual
twist
on
a
marzen
i
didnt
know
how
much
id
like
this
even
though
marzens
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
man
i
really
dug
this
one
its
sweet
but
the
rye
flavor
makes
it
just
a
little
different
than
most
biscuity
or
malty
oktoberfests
this
one
despite
being
in
my
comfort
zone
stylistically
definitely
opened
my
eyes
to
a
new
flavor
ill
definitely
get
this
again
i
dont
get
the
cherry
or
dark
fruit
in
the
flavor
that
the
label
mentions
maybe
a
little
in
the
aroma
does
pour
a
redorange
with
very
good
flavor
imparted
by
the
rye
as
advertised
very
carmely
with
a
crisp
bite
at
the
end
the
yeast
and
rye
together
are
very
nice
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
get
a
little
of
the
same
maltgrain
taste
that
the
denver
pale
ale
has
this
was
bottled
in
oct
of
13
but
still
very
good
will
look
for
fresh
this

well
done

conservatively
great
divide
continues
to
produce
a
solid
lineup
pours
golden
brown
with
1
finger
of
white
head
more
malty
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
flavor
than
im
used
to
in
a
lager
rye
caramel
and
subtle
lager
bitterness
this
is
a
really
impressive
lighter
beer
i
dont
normally
seek
out
lagers
but
this
will
be
the
exception
this
is
an
attractive
and
easy
drinking
beer
although
this
is
billed
as
a
lager
it
lacks
the
acidity
and
sourness
associated
with
lagers
perhaps
because
of
the
rye
so
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
great
divide
pours
a
deep
clear
golden
with
some
amber
hues
thin
head
and
light
lacing
nose
is
malty
with
notes
of
spicy
rye
and
neutral
lager
yeast
some
earthy
grain
notes
as
well
flavor
is
subtle
with
rye
malts
coming
forward
and
no
hop
character
to
speak
of
a
slight
spiciness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
decent
flavors
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
my
initial
aggro
pour
created
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
that
created
some
great
lacing
as
it
fell
color

beautiful
nose
had
a
rich
malty
scent
but
i
was
not
getting
the
fruitiness
the
label
mentioned
at
least
not
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
soft
slightly
bubbly
and
now
i
did
get
a
distinct
cherry
flavor
on
the
tongue
wild
the
rye
manifested
itself
on
the
dry
finish
giving
it
an
earthy
balance
to
offset
the
malts
this
was
much
better
than
i
anticipated
and
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
style
that
i
have
encountered
great
lacing
formed
as
i
drank
through
it
i
would
definitely
be
interested
in
having
this
beer
again
o
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
and
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
beer
the
rye
adds
a
nice
dimension
without
overpowering
it
theres
little
wow
factor
here
but
ill
be
damned
if
i
dont
say
im
craving
another
one
of
these
overall
very
nice
nice
hoppy
lager
that
is
quenchable
no
problem
taking
big
satisfying
swallows
a
bit
thin
overall
its
fine
and
the
caramelchocolate
light
finish
seems
unique
but
the
beer
lacks
some
thick
backbone
and
the
rye
angle
doesnt
seem
as
obvious
on
the
palate
as
much
as
the
nose
o
i
could
do
some
damage
to
this
beer
during
oktoberfest
everything
about
it
is
welcoming
and
not
too
overpowering
it
just
screams
session
beer
it
went
down
like
a
gatorade
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
buy
this
very
often
but
if
it
were
offered
i
would
definitely
partake
m
excellent
weight
and
carbonation
kind
of
weak
for
this
normally
heady
brewery
the
malt
just
too
understated
to
take
all
that
seriously
not
bad
but
more
summer
lawnmowing
season
friendly
than
autumn
leaf
raking
and
pumpkin
planning
appropriate
o
an
excellent
octoberfestrye
ale
recommended
overall
a
very
solid
spin
on
the
marzen
style
good
caramel
malt
taste
and
a
nice
twist
from
the
rye
and
fruit
undertones
overall
a
tasty
and
interesting
marzen
o
like
a
green
bottle
beer
but
with
slightly
more
character
would
not
purchase
again
minimal
carbonation
after
the
pour
the
carbonation
bubbles
almost
entirely
disappate
shortly
thereafter
beautiful
copper
red
color
and
brilliant
clarity
i
smell
the
bready
aroma
of
light
malt
and
get
a
bit
of
the
spicey
rye
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
tickles
the
taste
buds
on
the
way
down
the
flavor
is
definitely
typical
of
an
octoberfest
with
the
cleancrisp
flavor
and
malty
almost
nutty
flavor
the
nice
twist
would
be
that
nice
spicey
rye
note
overall
easy
drinking
nice
malt
flavor
in
the
end
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
fruity
cherry
notes
were
not
really
great
for
me
although
having
a
good
lager
mouthfeel
and
flavor
the
rye
is
a
good
idea
in
terms
of
flavor
however
it
makes
a
rich
style
even
richer
and
i
really
slowed
by
drinking
down
as
i
went
through
the
drink
maybe
not
all
bad
but
for
style
a
bit
of
a
drawback
comes
in
a
fun
red
plaid
package
with
a
lumberjack
on
it
abv
is
6
2
and
summary
mentions
rich
malt
cherry
and
dark
fruit
and
earth
and
spice
due
to
the
rye
poured
into
a
goblet
it
is
a
really
nice
orange
color
very
little
head
despite
an
uncareful
pour
and
theres
just
sort
of
a
brokendown
bubblefilm
floating
at
the
very
surface
now
you
can
really
really
smell
the
fruit
right
off
the
bat
definitely
the
cherries
and
maybe
a
little
berry
in
there
taste
is
also
very
cherry
and
might
i
say
holy
crap
it
is
good
theres
that
sweetness
that
i
notice
a
lot
of
gds
stuff
has
and
then
on
the
back
end
theres
a
little
bitterness
and
malt
for
a
second
or
two
maybe
that
spice
the
label
mentioned
but
i
dont
really
get
that
and
then
it
breaks
clean
off
really
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
smacky
and
the
carbonation
though
low
is
right
there
i
feel
for
a
marzen
i
had
this
a
few
years
ago
at
a
restaurant
and
didnt
like
it
but
im
wondering
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
stuffs
kickass
nicely
done
clean
larger
aromas
dominated
by
malt
deep
gold
color
with
light
haze
med
offwhite
head
vienna
munich
sweetness
dominates
flavor
without
being
cloying
nice
malt
complexity
low
to
no
noble
hop
flavors
but
appropriate
clean
bitterness
provides
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
medfull
creamy
and
makes
this
beer
a
joy
to
drink
overall
a
very
nice
maltcentric
octoberfest
marzen
style
lager
with
unfortunately
little
to
no
noticeable
rye
character
it
says
lager
on
the
front
so
im
hesitant
but
the
pour
looks
good
nice
deep
yellow
copper
foamy
head
dies
down
after
a
bit
not
much
lacing
but
others
have
mentioned
it
the
rye
and
malt
bring
this
out
of
the
lager
league
smooth
feel
hops
are
mild
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
makes
it
very
drinkable
out
of
the
gate
interesting
its
leaving
a
lip
smacking
sweetness
on
my
lips
i
think
a
couple
of
these
would
have
me
heading
back
to
my
favored
styles
but
for
something
that
says
lager
its
quite
nice
i
think
itd
go
well
with
a
burger
and
fries
the
beer
was
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
light
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
ring
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
light
rye
and
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
yeastbreadyness
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
good
a
nice
light
rye
flavor
with
little
to
no
hops
to
note
but
it
was
not
overly
sweet
the
beer
had
a
moderate
feel
to
it
the
beer
was
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
o
ive
only
had
two
other
marzens
and
this
was
better
than
both
the
kind
of
beer
to
turn
you
onto
a
style
if
its
typical
of
the
style
great
drinkability
wonderful
flavor
and
aroma
profile
another
slamdunk
from
great
divide
pours
up
apricot
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
retention
is
poor
but
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
the
nose
is
primarily
fragrant
pine
and
is
the
best
part
of
this
offering
taste
is
spicy
rye
that
is
a
bit
understated
with
a
mild
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinbut
with
adequate
carbonation
not
my
favorite
ever
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
few
belgians
ive
had
and
didnt
care
for
othis
beer
has
a
nice
color
to
it
but
i
am
not
wowed
by
much
else
here
the
fruity
flavors
are
not
assertive
the
malts
are
not
assertive
the
rye
comes
across
as
oxidized
and
dull
methinks
great
divide
should
go
back
to
the
well
on
this
one
o
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
marzen
style
i
prefer
those
that
stick
to
the
roots
of
the
style
and
explore
the
depths
of
malt
character
this
is
more
of
a
rye
beer
than
a
marzen
to
me
the
flavor
is
a
bit
harsh
and
doesnt
blend
particularly
well
with
the
malt
and
cherry
o
a
good
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
no
real
complex
flavors
or
aromas
here
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
really
good
marzen
smells
wonderful
and
tastes
like
sweet
malt
and
rye
o
overall
a
good
beer
bold
and
heavy
enough
to
where
you
only
need
one
two
at
most
for
a
filling
experience
on
tap
at
great
divide
pours
reddishorange
slight
rye
spice
and
some
bread
crust
touch
of
fruit
maybe
not
a
fan
favorite
but
one
of
my
favorite
ryes
for
sure
good
nearly
year
round
not
my
favorite
is
it
a
rye
lager
or
an
octoberfest
seems
to
be
confused
much
better
marzens
out
there
overall
an
interesting
take
on
an
oktoberfest
but
not
really
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
this
really
hinders
drinkability
o
maybe
its
because
i
enjoy
rye
in
beer
so
much
but
this
is
better
than
most
oktoberfests
imo
however
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
the
style
so
my
review
is
only
worth
so
much
hoss
pours
a
clean
amberorange
with
light
carbonation
and
little
head
retention
the
aroma
is
smooth
pristine
malt
and
bread
smells
like
the
typical
german
oktoberfest
its
smooth
malty
and
very
well
balanced
the
medium
body
is
cut
through
just
slightly
by
a
moderate
carbonation
and
the
malt
profile
is
rich
but
not
sweet
its
very
clean
and
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
us
made
oktoberfests
ive
had
i
dont
notice
the
rye
much
at
all
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
fantastic
well
crafted
beer
the
body
pours
a
clear
amber
with
some
visible
carbonation
the
head
rises
about
a
finger
and
subsides
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
powdered
sugar
little
to
no
lacing
the
nose
is
of
sweet
toasted
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
hearty
dose
of
rye
sweet
cherry
notes
are
prominent
with
a
mild
musty
earthy
undercurrent
on
the
palate
cherry
notes
come
to
the
forefront
with
sweet
toffeecaramel
quickly
in
tow
mild
earthy
hops
and
rye
poke
through
before
a
small
burst
of
cherry
and
caramel
in
the
finish
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
fruitcaramel
notes
and
earthy
hops
a
light
medium
feel
easy
drinking
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
that
i
have
overlooked
for
too
long
good
for
any
time
of
the
year
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
beer
had
an
amazing
reddish
hue
the
aroma
was
pleasingly
malty
sweet
with
subtly
notes
of
caramel
and
fresh
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
like
when
you
walk
into
your
veggie
garden
had
a
medium
body
that
didnt
linger
on
the
tongue
thank
goodness
as
the
flavor
was
off
putting
started
of
malty
and
sweet
but
ended
with
a
tange
of
brown
bread
which
i
found
unappealing
that
might
have
more
to
do
with
the
hot
dogs
baked
in
beans
served
with
the
brown
bread
that
i
hated
as
a
kid
than
it
did
with
the
actually
bread
i
was
very
excited
when
i
found
this
beer
marzen
and
rye
usually
peak
my
intrest
but
was
extremely
disappointed
overall
i
cannot
believe
this
surprise
for
starters
its
a
sneaky
oktoberfest
since
its
labeled
as
a
rye
lager
but
on
ba
its
a
marzen
and
the
best
one
ive
tried
this
year
o
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
how
representative
of
the
style
is
it
im
not
sure
but
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
great
for
a
session
o
the
rye
is
not
as
present
as
i
had
hoped
for
in
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
rye
spiciness
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
lighter
rye
flavor
and
well
hidden
alcohol
smells
of
cherries
and
psuedonutmeg
spice
over
a
caramel
malt
with
extra
earthy
hopping
and
a
touch
of
breaded
yeastiness
tastes
somewhat
drier
than
the
nose
had
me
expecting
but
still
semisweet
with
caramel
malt
and
plenty
of
toasted
bread
alongside
a
light
herbal
hopping
garnish
on
the
finish
the
cherries
from
the
aroma
are
very
much
subdued
upon
the
palate
in
the
actual
flavor
but
thats
okay
because
the
caramel
malt
gains
some
nuttiness
to
compensate
that
wasnt
as
perceptible
in
the
aroma
if
only
these
aspects
carried
fully
back
and
forth
from
nose
and
palate
to
present
a
complete
spectrum
this
would
have
been
absolutely
amazing
as
it
is
it
settles
for
merely
being
better
than

to

with

fairly

and
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is

alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
style
great
flavor
body
and
complexity
very
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
pretty
good
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
but
a
nice
brew
to
pick
up
once
in
a
while
did
i
mention
that
the
finish
is
oily
as
hell
overall
this
is
solid
fare
presenting
a
varied
and
finely
tuned
selection
of
flavors
that
balance
each
other
nicely
the
sugars
are
especially
lovely
in
here
coming
in
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
and
all
of
them
blending
well
with
the
rye
worth
trying
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
mix
of
flavors
and
balance
in
this
opossibly
the
best
marzen
style
beer
ive
had
the
rye
is
a
nice
addition
to
a
style
i
do
not
usually
care
for
notes
a
very
good
drinking
beer
and
good
for
a
cool
night
cheers
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
body
low
carbonation
this
is
a
great
marzen
one
of
the
better
american
ones
that
ive
had
the
pour
is
a
light
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
with
plenty
of
cereal
and
malt
notes
a
definite
rye
aroma
some
yeast
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hop
character
and
a
light
fruitiness
the
rye
is
very
pronounced
on
the
palate
sweet
bread
with
a
bit
of
toast
flavor
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
yeast
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
o
i
would
say
another
great
beer
by
the
great
divide
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
has
a
cool
label
very
nice
marzen
lager
hoss
is
the
boss
o
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
quite
good
for
the
style
the
body
was
crisp
and
clean
and
the
rye
flavor
lingered
for
a
few
moments
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
overall
a
very
nice
brew
worth
looking
for
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
bit
lacking
in
terms
of
rye
character
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
id
happily
drink
it
again
o
pretty
enjoyable
overall
more
of
an
aroma
would
be
nice
but
the
rye
flavor
is
well
integrated
do
this
is
a
decent
americanbrewed
amber
lager
that
compares
favorably
to
karl
strausss
own
the
brewer
has
taken
some
care
here
to
develop
tactile
qualities
of
substance
and
they
overlap
into
the
flavor
unfortunately
for
the
rye
crispness
and
spice
fight
a
losing
battle
against
qualities
of
fruit
caramel
and
an
overall
heaviness
that
is
on
the
high
side
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
tasty
but
in
my
opinion
misleading
brew
tastes
like
a
good
marzen
and
within
that
framework
this
is
a
pretty
solid
representation
of
the
style
still
needs
more
rye
its
like
a
very
less
skillful
surlyfest
i
cant
say
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
but
i
would
never
refuse
one
recommended
to
any
fan
of
amber
lagers
or
marzens
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
makes
me
understand
why
reinheitsgebot
forbid
the
use
of
rye
in
germany
a
very
flavorful
spicy
and
crisp
beer
overall
decent
beer
overall
not
exceptional
but
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
hoss
rye
lager
pours
a
deep
burnt
orangeauburn
falling
just
short
of
having
full
clarity
theres
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
capping
the
beer
it
fades
pretty
quickly
and
lacing
is
fairly
spotty
the
nose
is
pretty
dull
and
lifeless
but
what
is
there
is
nice
there
are
some
bready
and
toffee
aromas
and
the
delicate
spiciness
of
rye
creeps
in
a
little
bit
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
a
little
more
vivacity
to
it
with
biscuit
and
caramel
maltiness
coming
together
for
a
lingering
opening
earthy
lightly
peppery
rye
comes
in
for
the
close
but
seems
to
die
out
before
the
beer
hits
the
back
of
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
not
crisp
the
bodys
a
little
bit
chewy
and
the
carbonation
lacking
and
leaves
the
beer
giving
a
syrupy
impression
i
think
a
rye
marzen
could
be
a
pretty
interesting
beer
but
hoss
rye
lager
just
suffers
on
the
execution
end
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
darker
amber
reddish
color
had
a
very
thin
less
than
1
finger
bubbly
white
head
head
lasted
a
while
and
clung
nicely
to
the
sides
smell
had
a
touch
of
sugar
a
tad
of
hops
with
a
strong
wheatgrain
profile
as
well
taste
was
extremely
well
balanced
a
small
bit
of
sweet
a
little
hint
of
peppery
spice
with
a
mellow
banana
bread
almost
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
but
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
all
over
the
place
at
times
it
was
subtle
other
times
it
was
up
front
overall
a
good
representation
not
quite
sessionable
but
not
overpowering
either
another
easy
drinking
beer
hoss
rye
lager
is
an
interesting
spin
on
the
marzen
style
orange
amber
in
color
with
a
shortlived
whitish
head
carbonation
is
mild
for
a
lager
hoss
delivers
welcoming
notes
of
rye
alongside
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
down
the
hatch
you
get
more
maltiness
but
not
in
a
syrupy
sweet
way
clean
dry
finish
and
a
medium
full
body
round
out
the
brew
id
love
to
try
this
rascal
on
tap
o
a
good
beer
for
the
style
i
like
the
rye
component
good
but
not
worth
buying
again
o
incredible
beer
unique
and
so
damn
good
this
is
a
good
brew
with
an
evenly
balanced
nutrye
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
overpower
the
pallet
another
find
at
the
world
of
beers
in
altamonte
springs
fl
this
brew
appears
golden
amber
with
a
solid
haze
and
a
modest
but
stubborn
white
film
on
top
lacing
is
pretty
decent
the
aroma
brings
a
pleasant
apple
caramel
malt
with
an
interesting
cereal
grain
that
overall
makes
me
want
to
get
a
taste
the
taste
gives
me
a
very
interesting
tropical
fruit
over
yeasty
caramel
and
yes
i
get
many
grainy
overtones
like
rye
rice
and
also
a
slightly
sugary
corn
malt
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
very
fine
but
titillating
carbonation
some
smokey
hints
very
nice
grade
b
d
good
i
think
this
is
a
great
malty
lager
ill
drink
it
again
but
the
style
isnt
one
i
seek
out
o
a
decidedly
underwhelming
beer
from
great
divide
a
brewery
thats
usually
pretty
consistent
i
suppose
the
flavors
in
this
with
the
belgian
hint
are
actually
better
than
average
for
this
style
wishing
it
had
more
carbonation
or
better
mouthfeel

mouthfeel
with
a
mildly
dry
yet
refreshing
finish
incredibly
easy
and
comfortable
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
while
interesting
doesnt
largely
appeal
to
me
a
very
clear
amber
beer
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
settle
slowly
lacing
is
very
good
rye
pops
out
in
the
aroma
nicely
spicy
on
top
of
a
very
bready
malt
base
flavor
follows
the
nose
chewy
bready
malt
combined
with
prominent
rye
puts
me
in
mind
of
pumpernickel
very
wellrounded
and
refreshing
delicious
lager
overall
with
a
nice
floral
hop
note
in
the
finish
dry
and
crisp
medium
bodied
with
medium
high
carbonation
quite
good
and
was
a
welcome
antidote
to
a
steady
succession
of
highly
hopped
west
coast
ales
another
winner
from
great
divide
an
underrated
brewery
making
consistently
fine
highly
drinkable
beers
o
above
average
with
good
parts
no
real
weakness
to
this
beer
overall
very
drinkable
reminded
me
more
of
a
bock
than
whats
listed
on
the
site
or
on
the
label
style
wise
decent
just
like
their
scotch
ale
that
ive
had
but
i
havent
found
a
great
divide
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
transient
light
cream
foam
and
excellent
clarity
no
lace
smells
of
honey
munich
malts
and
some

nice

flavor
follows
with
some
sweet
honey
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
tea
like
character
from
hopsmalts
body
is
a
little
heavy
expected
from
addition
of
rye
with
light
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
nice
beer
would
drink
on
a
pint
special
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
finger
cap
of
barely
offwhite
head
great
lacing
and
minimal
beading
the
nose
is
big
on
the
rye
earthy
spice
and
nice
toasty
malt
to
balance
doesnt
come
across
as
a
marzen
one
bit
taste
theres
the
marzen
i
wish
the
rye
was
highlighted
a
bit
more
on
the
tongue
still
a
perfectly
drinkable
brew
feel
is
a
bit
boring
thin
and
brief
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
decent
i
suppose
o
overall
its
not
a
bad
drink
it
doesnt
thrill
and
the
bitterness
might
be
a
turn
off
for
some
without
the
joyful
hop
aroma
that
should
accompany
it
it
makes
me
wonder
if
the
bitterness
is
from
the
rye
or
from
the
hops
i
havent
much
experience
with
rye
brews
some
im
perplexed
o
the
taste
problems
make
this
one
a
pass
for
me
sucks
since
i
am
a
big
great
divide
fan
o
im
a
fan
of
this
stuff
its
not
a
style
which
i
frequent
however
im
going
to
be
paying
more
attention
to
it
this
is
a
fine
beer
a
ruby
redlight
brown
fused
appearance
with
a
very
small
white
head
smooth
aroma
of
rye
fused
malt
maybe
a
little
cherry
in
there
but
maybe
thats
just
me
looking
for
it
because
i
saw
that
ingredient
mentioned
on
the
bottle
starts
off
sweet
from
the
heavy
malt
base
and
some
cherries
slowly
but
surely
a
little
hops
kick
inn
towards
the
end
and
the
rye
asserts
itself
in
the
finish
a
heavy
body
to
this
kinda
syrupy
mouthfeel
to
this
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
one
seemed
to
grow
on
me
while
i
do
find
it
to
be
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
the
2nd
half
of
this
beer
seems
to
counter
that
sweet
aspect
well
enough
that
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
overall
the
taste
that
sits
with
you
after
a
sip
is
a
nice
combo
of
the
malt
the
spicy
rye
and
a
little
hops
and
i
enjoyed
that
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
definitely
the
antithesis
to
a
session
beer
imo
i
probably
wont
be
running
back
to
the
store
to
pick
up
more
of
this
right
away
but
it
is
a
beer
i
will
drink
again

nice
solid

overall
im
not
entirely
sold
the
beer
seems
unbalanced
fruit
rye
and
yeast
seem
to
compete
over
an
average
malt
base
and
they
rarely
all
seem
complementary
at
the
same
time
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
i
just
dont
think
it
has
a
defining

overall
a
pretty
decent
offering
from

having
had
few
rye
marzens
i
consider
this
a
success
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
ive
have
many
better
in
the
style
but
its
still
a
good
drinker
if
i
was
craving
a
good
oktoberfest
though
this
would
not
be
what
i
grab
by
any
means
not
bad
would
recommend
this
is
a
more
bold
version
of
your
standard
marzen
style
beers
the
rye
adds
a
spicy
finish
and
the
dark
fruit
offers
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
syrupy
finish
and
the
sweet
caramel
notes
arent
overbearing
but
do
wear
on
me
a
decent
beer
and
though
i
dont
think
it
was
old
to
the
point
of
being
ruined
i
would
like
to
try
it
a
bit
more
fresh
o
on
an
absolute
scale
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
a
nice
twist
on
the
marzen
style
however
like
others
in
the
style
i
dont
feel
too
inclined
to
drink
this
one
in
quantity
because
of
the
bitterness
level
along
with
the
spiciness
overall
drinkability
interesting
take
on
a
marzen
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
but
the
rye
shines
out
and
works
with
everything
else
in
the
beer
nice
and
i
would
probably
try
again
if
offered
not
quite
as
maltyheavy
as
most
marzens
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
im
glad
for
having
tried
it
o
this
was
okay
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
next
year
early
just
so
that
i
can
give
it
a
fair
shake
however
the
bottle
i
just
tried
didnt
do
much
for
me
overall
a
märzen
with
a
spicy
twist
this
is
another
winner
for
great
divide
i
dont
know
that
i
agree
with
its
current
classification
as
a
marzen
nor
do
i

but
is
does
lace
the
glass
nicely
aroma
is
subtle
and
yeasty
and
as
you
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
scent
of
iron
filings
comes
through
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
the
malt
and
bitter
nicely
cancel
each
other
out
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
it
is
only
in
the
aftertaste
that
you
get
the
rye
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
well
with
food
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
rye
lager
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
but
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweetcherry
side
for
my
liking
o
this
awardwinning
beer
can
only
be
classified
as
a
lager
on
technicality
im
sure
it
used
lager
yeast
which
results
in
the
light
body
but
the
complex
malt
character
and
hop
support
place
is
firmly
in
the
ale
category
based
on
what
i
expect
to
find
in
an
ale
a
very
interesting
recipe
overall
this
is
a
rare
miss
for
great
divide
in
my
opinion
which
is
too
bad
because
i
had
high
hopes
for
a
rye
lager
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
very
refreshing
a
little
more
spice
than
typical
for
most
marzens
i
have
tasted
i
think
that
is
why
i
enjoy
it
typical
lager
crispness
very
light
bodied
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
color
perfectly
clear
with
a
big
white
head
on
top
the
scent
is
a
great
balance
of
spicy
rye
malt
and
sweet
fruit
bread
notes
come
through
most
in
the
taste
with
a
spicy
rye
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
keeping
things
interesting
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
rich
copper
color
with
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
i
could
smell
the
rye
malt
before
i
even
brought
the
glass
up
to
my
nose
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
with
herbal
and
spicy
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
without
being
overly
so
as
it
warms
the
beer
does
begin
to
thin
out
and
that
would
be
the
only
real
drawback
to
this
beer
overall
it
is
very
solid
beer
and
a
welcome
change
of
pace
to
other
oktoberfest
beers
odecent
balanced
lager
nothing
too
exceptional
about
it
but
it
is
drinkable
and
can
compliment
different
meals
gave
it
a
vigourous
pour
and
received
a
good
layer
of
foam
that
slowly
died
down
atop
a
rubyamber
colored
beer
muted
malty
aroma
on
the
nose
and
the
hints
of
cherry
and
dark
fruits
that
the
description
on
the
label
promises
mellow
taste
its
sweet
around
the
edges
but
not
overpoweringly
so
more
like
dark
cherry
perhaps
some
cherrywood
or
whiskeysoaked
cherry
if
i
was
pressed
to
pin
it
down
the
rye
gives
it
an
edge
but
id
be
hard
pressed
to
describe
just
what
exactly
like
a
sweeter
less
hoppy
ryepa
i
suppose
different
from
what
id
expect
from
a
marzen
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
another
winner
from
the
great
divide
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
different
take
on
the
octoberfest
style
d
im
usually
not
partial
to
the
addition
of
rye
but
gd
has
made
this
one
work
nicely
overall
seemed
like
this
was
apopular
one
when
i
was
trying
it
at
the
brewery
not
very
complex
and
focused
on
the
fruitiness
as
oppose
to
the
beer
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
and
tasty
beer
i
really
liked
that
it
had
some
uniqueness
to
it
that
set
it
apart
from
other
beers
of
the
style
the
cherry
and
rich
malty
notes
were
very
good
as
well
in
it
overall
a
very
solid
beer
pours
a
mellow
500
sun
color
with
tiny
happy
bubbles
smells
like
a
rye
beer
possibly
overwhelmingly
so
but
taste
is
smooth
and
fair
even
understatedly
robust
makes
me
want
a
bigger
sip
second
impression
is
more
steadfast
lingering
yet
thin
somehow
in
the
mouthfeel
a
paradox
in
many
ways
this
rye
lager
is
worth
a
thirsty
quaff
6pak
of
this
from
total
wine
more
for
8
99
o
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
marzen
style
which
tends
to
be
rather
unremarkable
at
times
the
hint
of
rye
does
help
hoss
establish
itself
from
its
counterparts
very
easy
drinking
and
goes
nicely
with
the
impending
fall
weather
o
this
is
an
awesome
germanstyle
lager
seriously
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
great
nose
excellent
taste
profile
gotta
love
that
rye
and
a
fullbodied
feel
make
this
a
very
memorable
drink
great
divide
just
jumped
as
far
as
my
internal
ratings
go
keep
it
up
guys
light
crisp
slightly
grainy
very
easy
to
drink
overall
solid
beer
definitely
a
good
change
of
pace
for
me
since
i
drink
a
lot
of
ales
great
divide
always
makes
good
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
they
rye
gives
it
a
bit
of
uniqueness
you
wont
find
as
well
worth
trying
not
a
bad
beer
i
see
this
pairing
well
with
certain
foods
im
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
rye
flavor
but
i
like
this
one
ok
so
this
is
not
the
most
exciting
lager
i
have
ever
drunk
it
is
still
good
and
if
youre
buying
i
would
not
turn
this
down
at
6
2
abv
it
definitely
is
a
session
beer
i
would
have
liked
more
hops
but
the
lable
does
state
that
this
is
intended
to
be
a
lager
in
the
german
marzen
style
so
it
may
be
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
brew
i
did
consider
that
this
sample
might
be
too
old
or
have
been
mishandled
if
so
i
will
edit
this
review
i
was
drawn
to
this
beer
specifically
by
the
label
i
found
that
it
got
my
attention
so
i
figured
id
try
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
reddish
amber
color
the
head
was
an
off
white
and
had
a
pretty
good
retention
to
it
the
lacing
wasnt
a
that
great
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
little
bit
of
a
rye
aroma
to
it
mostly
smelled
like
a
typical
lager
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
it
had
a
good
malt
backbone
with
the
rye
kicking
in
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
feels
like
it
could
be
a
casual
drinking
beer
overall
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
the
brew
pours
out
as
a
coppercolored
body
subtly
hazy
medium
soft
tan
colored
head
with
lots
of
lacing
the
scent
is
toasty
malt
sweet
candy
some
cherry
touch
of
spice
with
some
of
that
rye
grain
as
well
the
taste
is
a
wellput
together
marzen
sweet
caramel
malt
front
rye
grain
fairly
spicy
some
cherry
influence
bready
toasty
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
just
a
bit
of
grass
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
it
deviates
slightly
from
the
classic
marzen
style
but
it
is
welldone
regardless
drake
o
overall
fairly
nice
the
rye
gives
it
a
smoothness
and
a
nice
flavor
malty
and
tasty
the
smell
is
a
little
lack
luster
but
overall
quite
enjoyable
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
zesty
and
fairly
generically
beery
the
taste
is
much
better
it
boasts
a
full
mailtiness
yeasty
notes
taste
is
sweet
eathy
spiciness
with
some
light
toasted
rye
and

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
like
the
blend
the
rye
is
done
well
so
that
it
accents
the
beer
rather
than
running
the
show
there
is
still
obviously
enough
to
taste

would

for
me
marzens
are
probably
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
i
love
this
great
divide
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
recommended
will
seek
this
one
out
again
i
was
about
to
grab
another
6
of
gdbc
claymore
but
decided
to
try
this
glad
i
did
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
great
lakes
conways
irish
ale
the
bottle
mentions
it
being
a
rye
lager
and
marzen
style
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
unique
nice
change
of
pace
edit
ive
since
had
it
again
and
still
get
the
peanut
butter
and
dried
strawberry
notes
but
no
one
else
that
was
drinking
it
did
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
drinkability
a
great
session
lager
with
an
interesting
flavor
i
wish
id
have
thought
of
it
did
prefer
a
little
more
carbonation
than
what
i
got
especially
for
this
style
that
being
said
this
is
a
pretty
original
brew
but
not
one
id
buy
again
im
glad
for
the
experimentation
but
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
d
pretty
good
and
tasty
crisp
beer
this
will
be
a
definite
summerfall
pick
for
me
a
bit
hoppier
than
average
for
the
marzen
style
and
the
rye
does
seem
to
lend
a
touch
of
sharpness
nice
bright
color
with
firm
body
moderate
roasted
carmel
malt
sweetness
promptly
followed
by
hops
bittering
with
the
rye
note
ending
sharp
not
a
distinctive
beer
but
certainly
worthwhile
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
but
fails
to
standup
to
its
german
counterparts
the
body
is
a
little
light
for
a
marzen
but
the
head
was
a
nice
nottoothin
cap
aroma
is
primarily
biscuitlike
malt
with
a
nominal
caramel
character
and
eversoslight
spiceearthy
quality
given
from
the
hops
flavors
here
are
pretty
standard
for
a
marzen
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malt
however
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
lacking
the
lingering
bread
notes
a
marzen
usually
carries
the
added
rye
probably
lends
to
this
as
this
one
finishes
noticeably
dry
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
enough
hop
character
to
balance
out
the
malt
focus
which
makes
for
a
solid
summer
brew
drinkability
mainly
tastes
like
a
slightly
too
sweet
marzen
with
just
a
tinge
of
rye
good
malt
taste
but
could
have
used
more
rye
andor
hops
notes
enjoyable
i
am
really
interested
in
trying
more
rye
beers
the
only
other
one
i
have
sampled
to
date
has
been
saranacs
rye
pilsner
which
i
also
enjoyed
i
was
hoping
to
try
this
with
some
corn
beef
and
cabbage
as
rye
bread
is
great
with
that
meal
great
divide
hoss
is
a
crystal
clear
amber
lager
with
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
that
thins
out
and
leaves
thick
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
rye
citrus
grass
and
maybe
corinder
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
chalky
its
pretty
sweet
and
quite
spicy
there
are
notes
of
resin
citrus
cherry
pretzels
and
fruitcake
the
aftertaste
is
spicy
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
it
wasnt
a
great
choice
for
lawn
mowing
but
its
rich
tasty
and
enjoyable
drinkability
isnt
too
good
its
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
three
for
me
not
bad
mostly
sweet
malt
but
enjoyable

has
a

it
also
overall
i
liked
this
brew
but
i
would
have
liked
more
rye
in
it
like
reds
rye
from
founders
still
i
recommend
and
i
will
buy
some
more
singles
i
liked
this
one
d
rich
and
bold
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
was
dubious
about
the
use
of
rye
in
beer
ive
had
one
other
rye
beer
i
didnt
care
for
but
this
is
a
definite
repeat
dthis
beer
is
very
drinkable
in
a
sessioning
sense
but
it
just
was
not
my
favorite
great
divide
effort
heavy
side
of
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
clings
to
the
mouth
well
drinks
very
well
wouldnt
turn
it
down
very
drinkable
nice
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bottled
on
3410
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
has
some
bread
biscuit
and
toast
in
the
aroma
some
nice
caramal
malt
starts
things
out
then
turns
to
biscuit
before
finishing
with
a
slight
rye
spiciness
has
a
good
full
mouthfeel
that
flows
nicely
and
finishes
with
good
bitterness
overall
a
nicely
balanced
brew
this
is
definitely
drinkable
maybe
sweet
for
me
but
better
for
others
d
this
beer
had
some
high
points
and
some
low
points
the
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
were
nice
but
that
was
about
it
i
wanted
some
spiciness
from
the
rye
to
shine
through
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
a
rye
beer
like
they
do
dthe
beer
is
drinkable
and
well
balanced
but
is
somewhat
one
dimensional
in
the
flavor
profile
for
a
rye
accented
beer
20oz
pour
at
the
brick
store
pub
im
a
big
fan
of
rye
so
well
see
how
this
plays
out
pours
a
coppery
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
smells
very
malty
with
only
a
touch
of
spicy
rye
at
the
finish
tastes
creamy
and
very
malty
with
a
rich
sweetness
and
firmness
and
once
again
only
a
touch
of
spicy
rye
i
suppose
i
see
the
point
of
adding
the
rye
to
try
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
but
im
not
entirely
sure
it
works
the
deeper
more
savory
rye
notes
are
lost
under
the
malt
and
only
a
bit
of
spiciness
survives
to
balance
still
its
tasty
enough
as
a
marzen
and
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
with
the
rye
spice
at
the
end
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
not
what
i
was
looking
for
i
wish
they
turned
the
rye
up
a
little
bit
more
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
undertones
of
bronze
beer
has
obviously
been
filtered
as
its
quite
clear
head
is
about
a
half
an
inch
thick
and
slightly
tan
and
fizzy
no
real
legs
or
head
retention
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
and
earthy
most
likely
due
to
the
rye
initial
sip
gives
off
a
lot
of
malt
character
with
the
rye
lingering
in
the
finish
relatively
crisp
and
dry
surprisingly
refreshing
light
mouthfeel
with
lingering
rye
though
it
can
be
a
little
bit
syrupy
some
caramel
notes
are
present
in
the
background
as
you
acclimate
to
the
beer
the
hops
come
through
with
notes
of
citrus
and
fruit
lots
of
cherry
the
rye
makes
this
taste
almost
like
its
been
oak
aged
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
good
on
a
warm
summer
night
d
really
refreshing
beer
with
a
little
zing
over
the
standard
lager
because
the
of
the
rye
used
drinkability
fantastic
marzen
lager
loved
it
very
good
brew
the
fishings
not
great
tonight
but
its
twilight
the
loons
are
calling
soon
ill
be
firing
up
the
merc
to
take
me
to
the
cabin
this
is
the
way
to
live
overall
opinion
pretty
good
rye
beer
and
its
always
nice
to
find
a
unique
craft
lager
not
something
id
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
bottles
of
in
a
sitting
d
after
one
sip
i
immediately
know
that
it
tastes
like
an
oktoberfest
i
think
this
brew
is
fairly
characteristic
of
its
style
aside
from
the
rye
base
that
comes
through
in
the
aroma
its
also
nice
to
see
a
brewer
produce
one
year
round
brown
color
maybe
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
light
malty
aroma
and
a
light
malty
flavor
good
as
a
marzen
try
it
if
you
like
it
d
very
easy
drinking
very
refreshing
well
hidden
abv
would
sneak
up
on
you
not
filling
flavors
are
a
well
integrated
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
a
very
crisp
texture
all
add
up
to
one
very
sessionable
brew
cheers
gd
and
thanks
for
making
this
one
a
yearround
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
so
i
cant
comment
on
its
general
quality
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
refreshing
and
complex
at
the
same
time
a
nice
beer
simple
and
effective
complex
and
tasty
loving
this
one
with
its
blend
of
festive
autumn
spiciness
from
the
rye
and
a
solidly
smooth
drinkibility
i
thought
that
this
was
a
perfect
fall
quaff
when
i
had
this
last
year
im
glad
to
see
that
great
divide
has
seen
fit
to
release
a
fresh
batch
this
spring

i
could
easily
drink
this
year

is
one
of
which
i
will
consume
more
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
too
many
in

as
the

could
overpower

the
carbonation
is
like
tiny

precise
and
prickly
yet
with
no
staying
power
as
a
flavor
the
rye
has
a
clear
delivery
but
doesnt
add
much
texturally
the
hoppy
side
of
the
equation
slacking
the
sweetness
never
comes
close
to
cloying
and
for
a
more

onesided
beer
its

balanced

highest
when
coldest

body
is
carbonated

the
rye
makes
itself
known
in

flavor
a
bit
but
does
not
overpower
this
beer
at
all
theres
some
nice
toffee
sweetness
in
there
balancing
out
the
rye
perfectly
i
like
this
take
one
the
marzen
style
i
like
that
it
is
out
at
this
time
of
year
too
not
bad
at
all
value
great
for
what
you
get
d
i
would
empty
a
few
of
these
in
my
gullet
but
had
i
a
choice
i
might
go
for
something
else
a
bit
less
aggressive
on
the
carbonation
front
drink
very
drinkable

with

snack

the

it
is

hoss
rye
lager
was
a
hazy
light
copper
in
color
with
a
half
inch
beige
head
that
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
on
the
mild
side
but
definitely
malty
the
taste
was
bread
malt
and
some
pepper
spice
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
combining
a
moderate
abv
and
reasonably
good
taste
im
not
a
big
fan
of
märzens
great
lakes
oktoberfest
being
the
exception
but
i
enjoyed
hoss
despite
the
fact
that
it
has
no
real
outstanding
characteristics
drinkability
is
good
its
just
not
a
beer
i
will
swirl
and
sniff
between
every
sip
i
really
enjoyed
this
stuff
when
it
came
out
in
the
fall
and
was
thrilled
to
see
it
return
as
a
year
rounder
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
starts
off
with
a
big
caramelized
malt
smell
followed
by
a
hay
like
scent
similar
to
an
alt
beer
then
some
dark
fruits
cherry
and
fig
a
rye
spiciness
and
some
mineraly
hops
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
classic
caramel
maltiness
upfront
followed
by
some
doughy
malt
flavors
spicy
rye
flavors
mineraly
hops
and
a
touch
of
cherry
this
is
a
really
superbly
balanced
beer
a
little
sweet
but
with
a
drying
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
but
not
overbearing
and
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
probably
one
of
my
top
marzens
along
with
ayingers
and
im
quite
glad
its
a
year
round
offering
now
f
finishes
dry
as
expected
but
it
has
more
of
that
sweet
malt
taste
on
the
finish
not
sweet
itself
though
lingering
is
a
spicy
earthy
tannic
dry
rye
taste
it
really
starts
to
bombard
the
tongue
on
the
finish
it
does
have
a
crisp
finish
though
and
doesnt
last
too
long
aside
from
the
lingering
rye
bitterness
not
bad
drinkable
adds
a
kick
just
seems
like
having
a
harsh
rye
added
to
what
should
be
a
very
crisp
refreshing
and
smooth
beer
such
as
a
lager
is
counterintuitive
but
to
each
his
own
the
beer
is
heavier
than
most
marzens
not
saying
much
but
still
this
is
noticeably
thicker
than
water
i
think
the
addition
of
rye
to
a
marzen
is
a
genius
pairing
of
grains
even
if
it
isnt
in
strict
accordance
with
reinheitsgebot
purity
law
hoss
is
the
boss
if
the
marzenoktoberfest
style
was
anywhere
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorites
the
scores
would
be
even
higher
than
they
already
are
great
divide
can
do
almost
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
carbonation
keeps
the
malts
from
weighing
things
down
beautiful
balance
a
bit
hoppier
than
a
traditional
marzen
but
not
so
much
to
disrespect
the
original
one
of
the
best
american
interpretations
ive
had
great
beer
for
spring
or
fall
grilling
or
crisp
afternoons
on
the
patio
this
is
a
great
beer
with
just
the
right
flavor
balance
easy
on
the
palate
and
extremely
smooth
refreshing
well
done
d
very
drinkable
the
spicy
rye
doesnt
overpower
you
and
everything
is
in
balance
here
it
is
a
very
pleasent
experience
from
start
to
finish
a
great
twist
on
a
classic
style
the
beer
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
the
addition
of
rye
is
subtle
but
does
add
a
dry
spiciness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
all
the
sweet
maltiness
of
a
true
marzen
while
also
having
a
dry
spiciness
that
does
add
a
bit
of
flair
to
this
traditional
style
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
breadypeppery
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
often
but
its
definitely
something
ill
look
for
as
a
regular
seasonal
this
is
an
interesting
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfest
i
definitely
like
the
addition
of
the
rye
that
with
the
rest
of
the
malt
really
adds
a
complex
grain
dimension
to
this
beer
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
a
few
of
i
could
see
this
pairing
quite
well
with
food
too
pours
a
luminous
amber
with
meringuelike
head
that
is
appropriately
thick
and
creamy
textured
gorgeous
nose
has
a
zesty
light
citrus
and
grainy
aroma
on
the
palate
it
comes
across
like
a
slightly
less
sweet
marzen
with
the
rye
grain
giving
a
little
hearty
flavor
of
its
own
finish
is
slightly
sweet
d
when
am
i
supposed
to
drink
this
its
really
light
so
i
think
warmer
weather
but
then
the
rye
darkness
factor
makes
it
not
a
summer
beer
so
is
it
a
winter
beer
nope
too
light
to
warm
my
soul
so
im
left
wondering
with
this
brew
its
unique
but
i
dont
think
id
have
another
single
from
whole
foods
fair
lakes
va
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
more
but
would
drink
again
3
5
d
a
little
too
bready
for
my
tastes
but
worth
a
full
glass
moutfeel
is
light
and
has
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
a
good
beer
different
yet
still
approachable
cant
say
i
will
be
making
this
my
goto
beer
anytime
soon
but
i
enjoyed
it
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
great
flavor
and
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
sadly
like
hop
rod
rye
its
not
distributed
in
vt
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
will
be
revisiting
also
great
with
food
i
am
currently
enjoying
a
pepper
smoked
turkey
sandwich
with
swiss
and
humus
on
whole
wheat
and
could
not
think
of
a
better
matchexcept
perhaps
rye
drinkability
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
it
goes
down
fast
refreshing
and
you
can
drink
this
all
night
long
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
a
nod
to
marzen
w
a
roggen
twist
the
rye
and
german
yeast
makes
for
a
quaffable
session
brew
very
creamy
feeling
in
the
mouth
for
a
lager
and
the
rye
spiciness
comes
through
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
nose
would
indicate
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
floral
hop
bittering
balances
things
out
nicely
this
is
a
fun
and
unique
take
on
the
marzen
style
and
it
works
pretty
well
it
would
be
nice
if
gd
would
send
some
of
this
down
to
tx
along
with
a
few
of
the
other
new
sixpack
offerings
they
have
brewed
lately

drinkability
an
average
beer
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
and
pretty
much
on
par
with
great
divides
other
regular
offerings
at
a
reasonable
6
2
its
fairly
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
put
down
a
pint
or
two
of
this
though
there
are
both
other
rye
beers
and
other
marzens
i
believe
i
would
prefer
nonetheless

a

with
a
thick

aroma
of
sweet

flavor
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
toasted
malt
perhaps
some
spices
i
dont
really
get
any
rye
notes
kinda
bland
but
certainly
drinkable
decent
for
an
oktoberfest
overall
so
smooth
and
delicious
hopefully
i
can
find
6ers
of
this
12oz
bottle
at
raleigh
times
consumed
on

and
reviewed
from
notes
the
beer
poured
a
crisp
orange
with
decent
diminishing
khaki
head
aroma
was
caramel
malts
rye
and
mild
hops
the
taste
was
an
interesting
balance
of
rye
caramel
and
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
cherry
flavor
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
slightly
dry
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
lager
one
i
likely
would
have
again
softly
carbonated
up
front
with
a
medium
body
that
has
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
malt
sweetness
earthy
bitterness
and
sweet
dark
fruit
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
toasted
caramel
malt
with
prominent
rye
flavor
which
is
balance
by
a
slight
earthy
tartness
hints
of
sour
dark
cherry
add
to
the
sweetness
and
balances
this
beer
out
pretty
nicely
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
making
this
beer
pretty
quaffable
decent
session
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
at
6
2
an
interesting
marzen
that
highlights
the
funky
rye
malts
to
good
effect
appears
a
pale
amber
orange
tinted
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
i
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
before
cracking
it
and
i
think
its
a
good
idea
speckled
lacing
all
around
the
edges
of
my
chalice
aroma
has
sweet
honey
drizzled
biscuit
and
honey
malt
layers
going
on
with
spicy
rye
additions
bringing
out
an
earthy
herbal
character
flavor
is
fantastic
sweet
with
malts
and
rye
more
of
that
honey
simple
syrup
flavor
with
a
fruity
apple
and
caramel
drizzled
tone
but
the
hops
and
the
rye
malt
balance
things
out
with
a
grassy
spicy
herbal
tea
accent
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
stickier
with
residual
malts
especially
with
the
higher
alcohol
and
the
rye
additions
carbonation
is
pleasant
and
smooth
the
entire
bottle
definitely
a
medium
body
with
the
rye
giving
it
a
bit
more
girth
than
your
average
marzen
drinkability
is
solid
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
drops
a
beer
that
strikes
gold
coming
from
such
a
known
ale
brewer
to
dabble
with
their
twist
on
a
great
german
style
i
enjoy
it
and
look
forward
to
more
next
year
d
a
good
beer
for
cool
weekends
not
something
i
would
return
to
just
not
my
style
of
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer

solid
flavor
nice
maltiness
a
mix
of
breadiness
and
toasted
malts
rye
adds
just
a
titch
of
spiciness
which
adds
a
little
complexity
to
the
flavor
profile
some
dark
fruits
are
noticeable
very
subtle
dryness
lingering
this
isnt
the
thickest
or
richest
marzen
ive
had
but
its
very
enjoyable
its
good
all
around
the
nose
is
great
bready
with
spicy
rye
apparent
theres
also
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
prominent
leafy
hop
character
sweetness
is
complex
i
also
get
some
brown
sugar
the
palate
opens
with
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
character
quite
herbal
and
earthy
with
a
little
minerallike
character
bitterness
is
low
and
this
allows
the
malt
to
shine
with
a
great
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
character
along
with
the
spicy
rye
character
which
especially
dominates
the
midpalate
and
towards
the
finish
drying
on
the
finish
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
great
mouthfeel
providing
a
little
heft
while
remaining
light
enjoyable
id
absolutely
drink
this
again
d
pretty
onedimensional
yet
tasty
and
quite
quaffable
a
great
session
beer
overall
it
was
a
nice
octoberfest
type
beer
nice
maltiness
but
still
finished
crisp
enough
to
drink
easily
d
this
beer
is
soft
and
clean
with
little
flavor
but
no
off
flavors
drinks
pretty
easy
but
not
interesting
enough
to
get
all
jacked
up
about
hopefully
i
will
get
to
try
this
a
bit
fresher
next
year

i
did

for

lager
which
trumps
its

does

counterparts
d
overall
a
very
nice
american
interpretation
having
tried
surlyfest
last
year
im
really
pleased
with
this
trend
of
rye
marzens
worth
seeking
out
light

medium

with
fairly
high
carbonation
to
keep
this
crisp
and
refreshing

with

a

i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
d
overall
i
was
excited
to
see
another
new
rye
beer
on
the
market
this
one
isnt
too
bad
worth
a
shot
d
easy
to
drink
nice
and
light
with
a
little
different
taste
than
a

to

i
could

crisp

easy
drinking
nothing
earth
shattering
this
one
is
very
easy
to
quaff
and
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
this
is
a
good
lager
but
it
is
simply
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
couple
in
one
session
pours
an
amazingly
clear
copper
color
with
a
tight
and
clingy
eggshell
colored
head
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
not
picking
up
much
perhaps
some
caramel
malt
with
a
light
sourness
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
no
buttery
flavor
woohoo
a
light
rye
sourspice
which
plays
well
with
the
malt
light
metal
notes
in
the
end
american
marzen
style
do
not
see
much
german
characteristics
in
this
one
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
an
airy
carbonation
finishes
well
balanced
and
clean
dang
this
is
a
pretty
good
marzen
the
caramel
malt
with
the
touch
of
rye
work
really
well
the
beer
drinks
extraordinarily
well
and
goes
down
easy
a
must
try
if
you
like
the
style
d
a
good
not
great
brew
and
probably
my
lowest
rated
from
gd
you
have
to
really
love
rye
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
the
value
of
this
brew
is
far
below
other
marzens
but
its
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
unique
twist
on
the
marzenoktoberfest
style
quite
good
and
quite
drinkable
pours
a
clear
dull
copper
colored
brew
with
good
bubbling
and
a
rocky
to
start
but
quick
receding
offwhite
head
the
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
spicy
caramel
thanks
to
the
rye
and
some
mild
hopping
the
taste
has
all
the
trappings
of
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
but
the
rye
seems
to
stick
out
a
bit
too
much
formy
taste
i
taste
some
good
toasted
white
bread
with
some
mild
american
hops
bt
the
rye
had
a
spicyness
that
doesnt
jibe
well
with
me
ot
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
still
a
good
session
brew
to
boot
but
style
wise
i
think
this
oneis
a
little
off
to
get
a
great
rating
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
just
a
touch
of
full
bodied
feel
upfront
falling
away
to
all
carbonation
and
becoming
increasingly
thin
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
bite
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
gave
off
a
slight
clove
and
banana
taking
a
sip
you
are
hit
with
a
slight
rye
flavor
that
is
spicy
then
you
are
hit
with
the
cherry
in
the
background
in
the
mouth
it
has
medium
body
and
a
good
crisp
finish
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
a
solid
effort
d
very
drinkable
keeps
me
wanting
more
alcohol
is
hidden
well
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
ofest
to
session
with
for
the
duration
of
the
evening
d
i
will
get
this
again
tasty
it
really
is
a
good
compliment
for
the
fall
weather
another
tasty
from
gdbc
for
an
unusual
style
of
oktoberfest
lager
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
consequently
very
drinkable
it
wants
to
dissapear
from
my
glass
at
a
rate
that
doenst
allow
any
proper
warming
warming
however
brings
out
and
melds
the
flavours
in
an
enticing
way
overall
a
nice
beer
but
sort
of
akward
for
the
style
style
parameters
should
be
larger
so
i
dont
care
so
much
im
just
saying
that
if
your
expecting
a
german
style
marzen
this
one
is
a
little
different
the
rye
adds
something
to
the
beer
for
sure
making
it
interesting
but
as
a
whole
im
not
terribly
enthralled
by
it
an
ok
beer
quite
a
nice
little
ofest
that
drinks
down
easy
while
keeping
just
enough
body
and
flavor
to
maintain
a
crafty
edge
of
enjoyment
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
as
it
turned
out
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
for
the
style
this
one
has
to
be
a
favorite
i
wish
great
divide
would
have
made
this
more
flavorful
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
good
beer
a
rye
oktoberfest
why
not
drinkability
a
satisfying
beer
to
be
enjoying
on
an
early
october
evening
the
welcome
addition
of
rye
adds
a
nice
bit
of
pep
to
this
märzenstyle
lager
want
some
rye
course
ya
do
return
to
zork
solid
d
very
good
and
the
point
of
this
beer
it
is
made
in
my
opinion
to
be
ultimately
very
drinkable
this
particular
oktoberfest
as
suggested
just
is
not
very
inspirational
to
me

along

change

pace
with

not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
with
a
twist
bottle
at
the
great
divide
tap
room
this
was
a
clear
amber
beer
with
a
soapy
head
the
smell
was
good
and
sweet
almost
intriguing
the
beer
was
a
nice
lager
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
the
rye
for
some
reason
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
but
i
did
i
may
need
to
pick
up
a
sixer
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
that
is
different
from
the
rest
the
spicy
rye
adds
another
element
to
this
beer
and
for
me
makes
it
a
standout
in
its
class
another
very
good
beer
from
great
divide
well
done
d
a
good
american
take
on
the
style
maybe
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
something
nice
on
a
fall
night
a
really
nice
beer
that
should
have
been
an
obvious
combination
before
now
drinkability
wow
this
is
a
very
good
marzen
and
is
also
in
my
top
four
of
the
style
i
love
how
i
can
taste
the
advertised
rye
i
really
like
the
way
the
bitterness
and
the
maltiness
come
together
you
can
taste
them
separate
but
they
also
blend
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
good
brewery
this
is
kind
of
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
brooklyns
version
both
excellenta
marzen
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
very
drinkable
brew
i
only
picked
up
a
single
but
if
i
had
a
six
pack
it
certainly
wouldnt
sit
in
the
fridge
long
before
magically
disappearing
d
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
the
cherry
really
adds
to
the
character
of
this
fine
brew
the
rye
is
understated
and
takes
a
backseat
but
still
adds
to
the
overall
depth
and
complexity
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
it
seems
to
stray
pretty
fair
from
the
style
guidelines
of
a
traditional
marzen
none
the
less
i
could
enjoy
this
year
round
and
may
invest
in
a
case
so
that
im
able
to
do
so
the
most
artistic
lager
to
come
down
the
pike
in
a
really
long
time
drinkability
i
could
go
through
a
6
pack
of
this
in
a
day
pretty
easily
nice
job
great
divide
d
well
balanced
and
great
malt
flavors
nice
offering
from
gd
lt
to
med
mf
and
a
good
oktoberfest
overall
decent
but
pretty
subdued
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
remember
much
more
of
a
rye
presence
medium
bodied
with
pretty
good
drinkability
one
of
the
better
marzen
lagers
ive
had
overall
this
had
everything
in
place
to
be
really
good
just
not
in
the
right
amounts
id
hoped
for
more
spiciness
and
caramelbready
malt
flavors
but
even
as
it
is
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
it
clear
amber
with
some
red
hues
and
nice
streams
of
carbonation
and
a
half
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
remains
atop
the
glass
as
its
drank
the
aroma
is
caramel
malty
with
spicy
notes
and
earthy
hops
flavor
is
malt
forward
with
biscuit
caramel
and
rye
has
some
earthy
hops
and
some
light
unripe
cherry
flavor
that
became
more
present
as
it
warmed
up
maybe
due
to
the
rye
its
medium
bodied
and
slightly
crisp
and
finishes
with
a
easy
dryness
overall
it
was
mostly
bready
malty
goodness
with
some
interesting
spicy
notes
and
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
allaround
drinkability
pretty
high
aside
from
the
nose
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
with
a
nice
toasty
flavor
its
listed
as
an
oktoberfest
but
it
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
being
quite
as
malty
and
sweet
as
that
style
i
would
definitely
sit
through
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoy
the
accompanying
buzz
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
would
be
a
good
pairing
with
roasted
or
bbqd
chicken
smells
like
honey
and
light
floral
hops
a
prickly
rye
spice
bolsters
toasted
octobermalts
for
a
more
aggressive
flavor
than
betrayed
by
the
aroma
good
stuff
drinkability
pretty
darn
high
ive
had
better
rye
beers
but
this
isnt
a
style
you
can
just
get
tons
of
yearround
ill
be
enjoying
much
more
of
the
hoss
throughout
this
season
light
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
cheers
clear
light
copper
body
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
noble
hops
on
the
palate
the
rye
pairs
nicely
with
the
caramel
malt
to
create
a
deep
satisfying
malt
flavor
spicy
grassy
noble
hops
provide
bitterness
to
the
finish
hoss
is
a
the
kind
of
style
reinterpretation
that
gd
is
so
good
at
this
may
be
great
divides
first
lager
but
i
truly
hope
they
try
more
of
them
they
have
proven
themselves
with
extreme
beers
and
belgian
styles
now
its
time
for
some
gd
session
beer
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
marzens
they
are
usually
too
sweet
but
this
one
tastes
a
little
cleaner
more
balanced
to
me
it
is
still
a
malt
over
hop
taste
which
is
in
line
w
the
style
but
it
is
low
key
enough
that
i
could
session
this
beer
maybe
this
has
something
to
do
w
the
rye
but
like
others
have
said
the
rye
flavor
is
very
subdued
and
difficult
to
detect
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
subtle
and
a
warming
temp
is
needed
to
bring
out
these
flavors
if
you
drink
this
too
cold
it
could
seem
bland
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
winner
and
will
definitely
be
part
of
my
late
summer
early
fall
rotation
this
is
basically
a
big
octoberfest
beer
which
is
no
bad
thing
medium
bodied
lager
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
a
very
smooth
drinker
my
favorite
american
marzen
i
will
be
without
a
a
doubt
be
picking
up
a
few
of
these
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
must
say
i
will
definitely
seek
out
a
qualified
sixer
of
this
overall
impression
a
nice
late
summer
offering
glad
to
see
great
divide
expanding
their
offerings
with
some
new
and
interesting
beers
d
hoss
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
next
time
im
in
the
tap
room
ill
order
it
again
edit
honestly
i
dont
think
time
has
been
kind
to
this
one
while
i
used
to
really
get
a
kick
out
of
it
lately
its
been
a
bit
boring
for
me
not
bad
but
just
not
great
pours
a
pale
golden
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
mellow
grains
faint
grassy
hops
and
a
subtle
rye
aroma
taste
is
also
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
marzen
drinks
well
but
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
i
didnt
find
much
of
a
rye
presence
light
body
is
well
carbonated
another
poor
attempt
at
an
oktoberfest
beer
by
a
mainstream
company
glad
it
was
free
admittedly
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
certainly
isnt
going
to
change
my
perspective
but
it
is
similar
to
many
other
yuengling
products
solid
and
inoffensive
but
a
bit
boring
and
unexciting
one
of
the
better
oktofest
beers
ive
had
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
brews
on
the
market
best
served
in
kegs
overall
i
was
surprised
since
this
is
a
very
good
ofest
and
is
from
a
macro
brewer
definitely
these
would
go
by
fast
as
they
are
thin
inviting
and
agreeable
to
all
oh
this
is
very
nice
the
initial
flavor
is
an
interesting
blend
of
hop
and
malt
but
it
grew
on
me
very
quickly
as
the
great
malt
profile
swells
i
really
like
this
one
the
oktoberfest
however
falls
short
but
at
least
theyve
opted
to
go
for
more
of
a
viennastyle
than
just
a
maltysweet
golden
festbier
the
appearance
is
good
and
the
aroma
is
ok
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
theres
some
caramel
to
it
but
overall
the
malt
fails
to
display
any
depth
of
character
some
lively
spicy
hops
bring
it
around
a
bit
and
there
is
a
touch
of
toasty
sweet
bread
to
it
as
well
as
a
light
fruitiness
but
it
still
seems
a
bit
threadbare
overall
bright
copper
light
for
the
style
but
still
malty
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
not
bad
either
overall
yuengling
oktoberfest
sadly
underwhelmed
me
i
hoped
it
would
be
at
least
somewhat
satisfying
it
wasnt
i
drank
warsteiner
oktoberfest
when
i
got
home
it
made
the
yuengling
taste
like
stale
bread
mashed
into
dirty
water
that
is
all
o
i
am
not
a
yuengling
fan
in
the
least
but
this
brew
really
is
not
bad
it
does
not
make
me
want
to
rethink
my
opinion
of
most
of
this
brewerys
products
it
does
not
really
challenge
my
indifferent
attitude
toward
this
style
and
it
does
not
make
me
want
to
rush
out
and
buy
a
case
but
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
again
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
slight
foamy
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
just
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
throughout
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
a
subtle
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
fruit
pretty
standard
stuff
not
much
kick
to
this
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
and
can
be
purchased
as
a
six
pack
for
just
about
7
fair
alternative
to
some
more
pricier
oktoberfests
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
despite
how
many
say
this
is
a
bad
brew
or
just
ok
rather
opposite
its
very
well
into
the
good
range
yes
it
is
rather
light
and
very
sweetless
malty
vs
othersbig
names
of
this
style
but
still
its
very
drinkable
overall
ok
brew
i
prefer
their
lager
but
this
isnt
terrible
not
a
bad
beer
very
drinkable
and

it
could
use
more
hops
but
still

product
yuengling
makes
great
beer
and
oktoberfest
märzen
style
beer
is
my
favorite
if
you
live
in
the
northeastern
us
it
is
very
inexpensive
making
it
one
of
the
best
beers
per
dollar

o
at

point
not

got

came
out
this
just
falls
well
short
heaven
forbid
you
have
this
with

i
couldnt

any

overall
very

this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
thought
it
was
delicious
and
smooth
something
you
can
sip
on
or
even
drink
fast
if
thats
what
your
going
for
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
not
over
the
top
at
all
like
some
seasonal
beers
can
be
over
all
i
recommend
this
beer
and
its
a
couple
cheaper
than
most
6
packs
as
well
so
thats
a
plus
o
for
the
great
price
7
dollars
a
six
pack
this
give
you
a
beer
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
their
flagship
traditional
lager
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
good
goto

it
wasnt

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
this
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
thought
it
i
like
the
color
of
this
brew
so
far
this
brew
is
ok
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
rich
with
flavor
and
some
sweetness
at
the
end
oktoberfest
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
yuengling
did
a
real
nice
job
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
to
this
brew
oktoberfest
has
a
clean
finish
to
it
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
5
this
brew
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
okay
taste
a
little
light
in
flavor
a
drinkable
everyday
beer
my
palette
must
be
completely
out
of
whack
compared
to
most
other
reviewers
but
this
was
horrible
it
was
bad
enough
that
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
it
i
so
wanted
to
like
it
as
yuengling
is
my
usual
default
when
out
and
about
one
of
my
favorite
variations
of
oktoberfest
beers
i
had
it
at
a
friends
house
a
couple
years
back
and
now
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
do
they
still
make
this
brew
or
not
yuengling
festbier
is
a
pleasant
surprise
kind
of
like
a
toastier
version
of
their
flagship
lager
ive
had
worse
marzens
from
true
craft
brewers
overall
a
decent
beer
i
was
eager
to
taste
this
one
since
the
summer
wheat
from
yuengling
was
so
good
this
one
was
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
as
i
think
i
would
prefer
the
traditional
lager
to
this
one
its
ok
but
very
sweet
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
i
picked
this
up
while
traveling
through
pennsylvania
i
stopped
to
pick
up
regular
yuengling
and
saw
this
next
to
it
in
the
cooler
its
pretty
close
to
shiner
oktoberfest
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
like
most
oktoberfest
beers
its
malty
and
sweet
give
it
try
whenever
it
comes
around
in
the
fall
if
the
metallic
notes
and
fruity
esters
arent
there
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
its
a
touch
sweet
but
not
bad
good
malt
character
great
oktoberfest
not
the
best
i
tried
but
very
much
addictive
for
an
oktoberfest
honestly
i
like
this
oktoberfest
better
than
sam
adams
kudos
to
yuengling
for
another
wonderful
beer
i
know
their
beer
list
is
small
but
i
have
liked
all
their
brews
so
far
except
1
but
i
guess
that
goes
with
any
brewery
the
feel
is
easy
enough
and
despite
the
load
of
bubbling
in
appearance
the
carbonation
level
is
really
low
o
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
readily
available
at
least
in
my
area
oktoberfest
that
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
and
is
much
more
affordable
than
its
many
counterparts
a
sweet
and
crisp
selection
that
i
wont
say
no
to
an
amber
beer
with
a
slight
whitish
head
and
a
clear
complexion
the
smell
is
malty
and
clean
but
also
a
little
subtle
i
like
this
beer
much
better
than
the
traditional
yuengling
lager
mediumlight
in
body
medium
in
flavor
but
not
at
all
bad
some
bread
and
a
faint
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
smooth
while
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
if
someone
hands
me
onei
personally
would
not
buy
itor
seek
it
out
againas
i
saidnot
a
bad
beerbut
not
worth
looking
for
eitherbecause
there
are
so
many
gr8
octoberfest
beers
out
there
cheers
peace2all
o
while
i
prefer
a
more
robust
oktoberfest
beer
personally
this
beer
was
really
popular
with
my
relatives
whom
are
not
beer
connoisseurs
and
was
probably
the
best
option
where
we
stopped
to
grab
some
beers
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
my
beers
in
the
style
and
a
little
too
watery
thankfully
the
alcohol
was
not
detectable
in
this
and
if
i
had
another
one
id
probably
kick
back
with
it
too
this
is
almost
as
mindless
as
a
beer
gets
and
only
worth
a
go
once
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
nearsession
octoberfest
offering
even
the
bottle
wasnt
green
and
not
that
it
mattered
but
i
almost
wanted
to
find
something
to
take
away
from
this
its
decent
for
enjoying
the
season
with
but
not
for
much
else
unfortunately
yuengling
oktoberfest
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
price
it
pours
a
nice
rust
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
and
good
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
good
with
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
of
hops
but
overall
high
quality
oktoberfest
for
small
price
defiantly
a
great
beer
for
a
sunday
of
football
o
ever
since
i
had
a
yuengling
light
i
have
been
turned
off
by
this
brewery
i
was
given
this
beer
otherwise
i
would
have
never
bought
it
and
i
probably
wont
buy
it
overall
typical
oktoberfest
style
of
beer
both
the
hops
and
the
malts
flavors
are
mild
and
balance
each
other
well
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
seems
too
sweet
and
watered
down
for
the
style
overall
not
really
worth
picking
up
a
case
for
but
on
par
with
the
amber
lager
i
think
i
will
still
pick
up
the
amber
lager
over
this
considering
it
easier
to
drink
as
less
expensive
yuengling
lager
with
just
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
and
chewiness
in
the
malt
palate
more
like
an
amber
vs
a
good
craft
oktoberfest
paid
about
28
for
the
case
so
not
a
bad
price
but
there
is
not
enough
substance
to
make
me
purchase
another
case
i
would
love
to
see
yuengling
experiment
just
a
little
bit
with
their
hops
no
variety
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
was
even
more
excited
to
spit
it
out
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
certainly
one
of
the
least
of
its
kind
it
makes
me
sad
its
tastes
slightly
of
sweatsocks
and
despair
its
fine
if
you
are
into
self
abuse
otherwise
skip
it
if
you
want
to
pay
15
bucks
for
a
six
pack
you
could
find
a
better
oktoberfest
but
for

and
with
this
beer
being
clean
and
all
id
certainly
go
back
for
more
as
we
all
know
yuengling
is
americas
oldest
brewer
now
they
have
crafted
this
seasonal
something
that
they
have
not
done
before
as
i
can
remember
in
any
case
this
can
be
best
described
as
an
average
expression
of
this
style
that
hits
all
the

it
has

are
coming

with

version
of
an

one
of
the
best
that
has
the
authentic
taste
is
by
sam
adams
when
i
drink
that
makes
me
feel
like
it
the
middle
of
fall
watching
football
it
may
be
cliche
but
i
friggin
love
sam
adams
version
should
have
got
that
instead
i
give
it
a
3
25
im
surprised
at
the
low
scores
for
this
beer
must
be
the
snob
factor
since
the
regular
yuengling
is
very
boring
for
a
marzen
this
beer
is
very
well
crafted
beutuful
in
the
glass
with
excellent
head
and
body
smells
wonderful
taste
is
flavorful
with
sweetness
and
malt
but
suble
and
creates
the
sessionable
drinkability
you
want
for
an
oktoberfest
brew
overall
this
is
an
under
the
radar
brew
that
deserves
a
lot
more
accolades
than
it
is
getting
for
this
style
i
personally
have
it
rated
as
one
of
my
favorites
out
there
d
meh
pedestrian
and
passable
at
best
i
really
was
hoping
for
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
didnt
find
one
honestly
wasnt
too
much
difference
between
this
and
yuengling
traditional
lager
caramel
and
toasty
bread
mild
sweetness
on
the
tongue
and
throat
but
not
the
least
bit
syrupy
no
overwhelming
hop
character
finish
is
almost
too
dry
uber
sessionable
lacks
the
depth
body
and
character
of
true
craft
but
damn
nice
for
6
a
six
from
a
sudomacro
brewery
o
well
this
was
a
good
octoberfest
its
one
of
the
better
low
cost
beer
beverages
ive
had
in
a
while
and
ill
get
it
again
yuenglings
oktoberfest
is
a
fine
beer
but
its
not
exactly
a
traditional
oktoberfest
its
a
oktoberfestinspired
lager
thats
made
with
common
american
technique
recipe
and
ingredients
a
nice
reinvention
albeit
simplified
and
rugged
a
very
watered
down
bland
massappeal
kind
of
ofest
nice
drinkable
oktoberfest
brew
tried
many
different
marzen
brews
from

this
will
keep
up
with
the
top
25
out
there
easily
if
you
live
in
pennsylvania
nice
with
an
open
fire
for
a

as
the
mercury
dips

pours
a
clear
medium
coppery
amber
hue
with
a
slowly
fading
beige
head

and
taste
of
toasted

some

and

with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
with
a
toasted

some

a
bit

overall
a
descent
drinking
brew
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
leaves
lacing
there
is
very
little
to
the
aroma
aside
from
a
slight
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
nothing
distinguishing
to
it
and
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
better
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
smoothness
but
pretty
bland
overall
unfortunately
this
is
exactly
what
i
expected
in
an
oktoberfest
from
yuengling
decent
beer
not
to
threatening
to
light
lager
drinkers
o
overall
i
like
this
better
than
a
lot
of
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
would
i
buy
more
than
a
6
or
12pack
of
this
no
i
think
it
was
a
good
beer
considered
it
was
simply
a
seasonal
offering
from
yuengling
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
brown
color
body
with
no
head
just
a
very
thin
lace
around
the
top
the
smell
is
faint
of
malt
the
taste
is
very
sweet
malt
almost
honey
sweet
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
light
and
overall
i
dont
like
this
one
too
much
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
overall
this
was
just
fair
woudnt
buy
this
again
onothing
special
but
really
no
flaws
yuengling
oktoperfest
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
the
taste
is
kinda
like
an
amped
up
yuengling
lager
actually
especially
on
the
finish
where
it
has
a
bit
of
that
watery
taste
the
malts
are
more
full
nuttier
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
og
yuengling
the
nuttiness
is
most
apparent
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
that
really
is
quite
reminiscent
of
the
original
yuengling
lager
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
special
but
also
not
a
bad
beer
the
taste
is
malty
roasted
toasted
a
bit
nutty
a
light
tang
and
a
moderate
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
offering
smooth
clean
mouthfeel
that
begs
to
be
gulped
spoton
carbonation
gives
the
beer
enough
girth
to
satisfy
me
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
light
fruity
back
end
bready
finish
alcohol
adds
just
enough
zip
to
bolster
this
beer
a
total
maltheads
dream
really
a
good
beer
i
expected
to
find
some
major
flaws
in
this
but
i
couldnt
really
find
any
a
wellmade
beer
perfect
for
the
cooler
months
ahead
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
right
on
where
i
expect
it
to
be
not
too
thin
that
the
beer
just
washes
away
too
quick
but
not
so
thick
that
it
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
o
a
good
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
beer
the
flavor
definitely
has
a
distinct
yuengling
taste
and
is
eerily
similar
to
their
traditional
lager
the
big
difference
is
the
prominent
roasted
nutty
malt
flavors
very
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
munich
and
crystal
malt
scent
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
breadlike
character
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
faint
malt
character
with
a
thin
dry
finish
it
goes
down
quick
and
easy
with
little
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
its
a
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
has
little
mouthfeel
and
seems
too
thin
and
lacking
for
the
style
this
is
a
nonoffensive
seasonal
thats
easy
drinking
but
nothing
to
boast
about
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
does
not
leave
much
lacing
very
malty
aroma
is
present
dark
roast
dominating
nothing
really
stands
out
tastes
of
caramel
and
dark
roasted
malt
but
not
really
strong
and
more
mass
produced
beer
is
carbonated
correctly
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
mineral
with
a
touch
of
sulfur
lager
yeast
throughout
with
some
grainy
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
caramel
bread
slight
hints
of
citric
hop
bitterness
hhowever
a
little
too
light
and
lack
luster
for
the
style
carbonated
like
a
light
lager
a
little
overdone
but
drinkable
and
a
nice
new
offering
from
yeunling
overall
im
glad
to
see
yuengling
have
a
new
offering
this
is
quite
the
change
of
pace
from
their
regular
offerings
i
would
gladly
try
this
every
year
around
the
fall
season
overall
a
good
drinking
ofest
as
for
the
price
ya
id
buy
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
also
very
malty
some
sweetness
a
touch
of
hops
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
another
simple
uncomplicated
easy
to
appreciate
beer
from
yuengling
cant
imagine
choosing
this
over
a
german
version
of
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
enjoyable
and
eminently
drinkable
not
sure
id
ever
order
it
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
glass
i
ordered
at
keglers
drinkability
all
in
all
an
easy
beer
to
knock
back
if
you
dont
set
your
sights
too
high
a
decent
beer
to
get
some
crossover
action
from
the
bmc
crowd
d
this
is
not
a
particularly
enjoyable
marzen
in
terms
of
flavor
its
solid
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
or
lack
of
complexity
this
also
shows
some
unusually
prominent
yeast
character
that
seems
out
of
place
this
is
one
weird
marzen
where
is
the
malt
and
bakery
like
presence
really
not
interesed
in
having
this
again
at
all
o
while
i
do
appreciate
yuengling
beers
i
cant
say
they
are
my
go
to
or
even
something
i
even
think
about
other
than
that
rare
occasion
of
not
having
time
to
go
to
my
craft
honey
hole
this
just
isnt
a
marzen
you
could
make
the
excuse
its
a
good
cheap
brew
but
the
fact
is
i
can
buy
a
glbc
oktoberfest
6
pack
for
75
cents
more
or
2
bombers
of
brauerei
aying
marzen
for
exactly
the
same
i
respect
folks
buying
their
weekend
sixer
of
yuengling
rather
than
buying
any
ab
bud
bud
light
but
the
truth
is
there
are
too
many
damn
good
beer
makers
personally
known
myself
for
me
to
call
this
my
favorite
brewer
while
my
appreciation
is
there
my
wallot
will
not
always
be
this
experience
actually
made
me
appreciate
what
great
lakes
sends
down
my
way
and
trust
me
ive
bought
enough
glbc
ofest
to
take
care
of
my
marzen
fix
for
fall
2012
craft
guys
who
try
this
will
know
what
i
mean
and
understand
my
standards
of
ales
and
lagers
others
who
switched
from
bud
to
yuengling
probably
wont
but
hey
those
people
wont
be
reading
and
writing
reviews
on
brews
anyway
this
is
worth
a
try
for
most
though
its
not
bad
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
festbier
this
one
isnt
going
to
do
it
no
sign
of
an
abv
or
bottling
date
to
be
found
overall
a
below
average
octoberfest
o
not
bad
and
a
good
value
o
this
misses
the
mark
as
an
oktoberfest
and
simply
tastes
like
yuengling
traditional
lager
with
a
little
bit
more
caramel
malt
instead
of
the
rich
fullbodied
malt
aroma
and
taste
that
comes
with
good
oktoberfest
beer
this
is
rather
thin
all
the
way
through
with
a
mostly
grainy
aroma
and
taste
honestly
id
rather
go
for
regular
yuengling
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
this
isnt
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
cheap
and
highly
drinkable
there
arent
really
any
off
flavors
but
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
style
traditionally
overall
this
beer
flat
misses
the
mark
this
is
a
brief
review
from
me
but
there
isnt
much
that
i
can
say
here
it
doesnt
come
across
like
a
marzen
this
is
difficult
to
drink
poured
a
good
dark
orange
with
a
wonderful
head
aroma
was
a
little
plain
if
almost
nonexistent
but
the
look
was
impressively
beautiful
a
fan
of
spicier
oktoberfests
i
wasnt
entirely
thrilled
with
the
taste
although
it
did
absolutely
nothing
wrong
it
was
better
than
the
average
oktoberfest
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
the
mouthfeel
was
terrific
though
as
it
flowed
smoothly
down
no
weird
aftertaste
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
representation
of
the
marzen
style
and
hopefully
they
continue
next
year
as
this
was
a
decent
entry
plus
who
doesnt
love
a
family
operated
brewery
like
yuengling
overall
served
cold
this
beer
is
great
you
can
pick
out
the
adjuncts
as
it
warms
some
but
i
think
this
is
better
than
lager
single
finger
head
with
little
retention
and
some
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
with
golden
hues
body
aroma
is
very
simple
and
mostly
malty
with
little
spice
or
hop
character
to
make
you
think
of
a
good
marzen
flavor
is
a
touch
sour
the
caramel
malts
do
not
add
much
sweetness
the
hops
are
mild
and
there
are
no
spices
add
here
to
make
this
a
good
one
for
the
genre
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
tastes
like
old
amber
yuengling
while
their
new
bock
entry
was
for
me
a
disappointment
this
oktoberfest
is
one
that
is
remarkably
simple
and
straightforward
in
what
is
sets
out
to
be
and
not
too
shabby
tasting
either
this
beer
is
a
complete
turd
its
a
yuengling
lager
with
a
bit
more
malt
period
if
they
used
nobel
hops
you
would
never
know
this
beer
is
a
serious
let
down
a
cheap
way
to
market
different
beer
a
loser
to
stay
clear
of
no
on
second
thought
try
it
and
have
a
laugh
terrible
effort
o
a
decent
beer
moreys
bottom
line
not
too
bad
actually
definitely
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
the
original
lager
more
malts
and
hops
not
topnotch
within
the
style
but
drinkable
for
sure
overall
pretty
decent
beer
here
its
not
outstanding
but
its
a
simple
solid
brew
not
the
best
maerzen
style
i
have
had
but
its
a
nice
and
tasty
brew
and
at
a
price
of
around
7
a
six
pack
one
cannot
go
wrong
with
it
for
me
it
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
think
is
well
worth
a
good
drink
the
old
standby
beer
produces
another
affordable
easy
drinking
but
not
spectacular
beer
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
12

stays
around
a
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount

the

smells
mostly
like
caramel
and

with
a

also

is
medium
its
a

with

its

i
think
its
a
solid
oktoberfest
brew
and
its
priced
right
at
6
99
a
sixpack
this
is
surprisingly
good
not
the
best
marzen
but
better
than
i
assumed
from
a
brewery
that
hasnt
branched
out
into
seasonals
before
it
goes
down
really
easily
and
has
an
interesting
taste
i
think
i
would
have
this
again
and
i
hop
yuengling
considers
other
seasonals
moving
forward
very
well
done
for
a
pennsylvania
larger
brewery
7
for
a
sixpack
sold
poured
from
bottle
clear
amber
color
small
off

has
some
toasted

caramel
taste
toasted
roasted
malts
at
first
feels
a
bit
thin
and
has
a
sweet
cereal
like
finish
overall
an
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
i
could
have
a
few
big
steins
of
this
season
my
first
ofest
beer
of
the
year
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
half
liter
steina
clear
lighter
bronze
shade
with
a
large
fluffy
slightly
off
white
crown
atop
aromas
are
light
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
toasted
grain
a
little
watery
feel
to
itflavors
mainly
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
grain
its
very
average
and
not
complex
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
mind
blowing
hopefully
the
worst
oktoberfest
beer
of
the
year
for
me
overall
living
in
pennsylvania
now
and
having
greater
access
to
yuenglings
many
brews
i
really
have
come
to
appreciate
what
they
offer
it
is
a
good
product
at
a
great
price
like
their
year
round
beers
their
octoberfest
is
no
different
while
not
the
best
per
say
for
its
price
to
quality
ratio
it
is
one
of
the
best
it
has
good
flavor
as
well
as
a
nice
color
and
smell
i
say
its
a
job
well
done
by
yuengling
overall
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
style
beer
from
americas
oldest
brewery
this
tastes
like
a
fuller
maltier
cleaner
version
of
yuenglings
standard
trademark
lager
beer
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
around
the
late
summer
and
fall
months
for
years
to
come
certainly
one
of
if
not
the
finest
yuengling
brew
this
poured
out
as
a
copperish
looking
brown
color
the
head
was
kind
of
soapy
looking
and
cream
colored
the
lacing
and
retention
was
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
malty
aromas
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
lager
yeast
in
there
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
average
to
seems
like
just
a
slightly
different
flavor
than
their
traditional
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
and
a
solid
dry
finish
to
it
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
it
was
fun
to
try
and
i
was
happy
i
did
but
i
wouldnt
have
to
go
after
this
one
like
i
do
with
samuel
adams
each
year
decent
stab
by
yuengling
ill
be
fine
and
dandy
finishing
out
the
sixpack
this
is
another
winner
for
americas
oldest
brewery
no
brewery
is
more
american
than
yeungling
autumn
amber
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
frothy
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
foam
ring
at
the
top
of
the
glass
sweet
toasted
malt
nutty
and
earthy
grass
aromas
smooth
delicate
feel
with
rich
pleasant
carbonation
sweet
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
into
the
middle
a
sharp
bitter
hop
character
from
middle
to
end
bitter
flavor
tapers
quickly
allowing
the
sweet
maltiness
to
shine
through
again
at
the
finish
finishes
with
a
sour
biscuit
flavor
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
was
a
better
than
expected
offering
from
yuengling
good
oktoberfest
what
i
love
about
yuengling
is
that
they
really
put
there
own
spin
on
their
beers
you
can
tell
it
is
a
yuengling
beer
the
aftertaste
burnt
and
slightly
metallic
is
not
so
bad
to
kill
this
but
its
just
a
maltier
yuengling
lager
to
me
its
just
about
average
better
and
worse
ofests
out
there
not
bad
not
great
yuengling
fans
might
not
have
as
much
of
a
problem
with
it
than
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
any
real
punch
an
easy
drinking
brew
though
it
is
good
to
see
yuengling
trying
some
other
styles
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
ruddy
copper
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
has
a
leafy
bready
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
flavors
of
tea
leaves
and
light
butterscotch
with
a
yeasty
aftertaste
body
seems
a
little
thin
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
oktoberfest
beer
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
quite
as
good
as
other
american
octoberfests
but
not
bad
at
all
would
go
great
with
a
good
hearty
meal
always
like
to
try
new
things
from
one
of
the
nations
oldest
brewery
couldnt
find
it
last
year
on
tap
glad
its
in
bottles
this
year
nice
copper
color
and
aroma
that
has
a
good
hop
presents
glad
to
see
the
fine
people
at
yuenling
trying
something
different
would
love
to
see
if
they
did
a
cream
ale
in
the
near
future
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
poured
a
very
nice
deep
burnished
orange
although
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
decent
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
leafycaramel
tone
decent
flavor
very
sweet
lagerish
malt
very
clean
and
crisp
decent
fall
flavor
but
nothing
deep
goes
down
very
very
smoothly
on
tap
at
mcclaffertys
irish
pub
beer
had
a
great
copper
color
and
sweet
smell
the
taste
and
quality
was
not
only
comparable
to
a
lot
of
more
expensive
oktoberfests
ive
had
i
got
this
for
1
50
a
pint
not
on
special
but
i
think
it
was
even
better
i
had
a
sam
adams
oktoberfest
on
tap
that
same
night
and
i
think
the
yuengling
oktoberfest
put
the
s
a
to
shame
maybe
i
was
just
biased
because
it
was
a
yuengling
beer
but
either
way
its
an
excellent
oktoberfest
o
not
a
horrible
beer
overall
as
it
is
very
drinkable
and
cheap
at
a
bar
but
not
a
great
representation
of
style
o
easily
approachable
and
easy
drinking
not
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
but
i
could
enjoy
drinking
this
all
night
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
stuff
and
i
think
it
is
quite
a
good
beer
for
how
cheap
it
is
i
wish
it
would
replace
the
traditional
lager
but
something
tells
me
that
is
a
pipe
dream
yuengling
oktoberfest
is
a
decent
beer
with
all
of
the
right
flavors
but
it
still
kind
of
tastes
like
watered
down
fest
bier
overall
the
caramel
taste
here
its
its
just
odd
and
maybe
its
just
me
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
falseness
to
it
like
the
added
flavoring
to
that
saranac
caramel
porter
its
not
an
abhorrent
beer
but
it
sure
doesnt
stack
up
against
the
better
examples
of
the
style
or
even
the
notsobetter
ones
taste
similar
to
the
lager
but
better
has
some
caramel
and
bread
notes
of
the
style
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
flavor
bitter
herb
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
yuengling
but
closer
to
average
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
slightly
sweet
and
toasted
malt
aromas
carry
over
to
the
palate
in
a
restrained
and
well
balanced
way
with
a
little
of
the
metallic
bitterness
that
resembles
some
of
the
flavors
in
regular
yuengling
lager
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
make
this
go
down
easy
very
solid
o
easy
drinker
nice
seasonal
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
while
visiting
family
in
pottsville
the
pour
is
light
orange
decent
head
the
aroma
is
faint
sweet
i
quite
honestly
thought
this
was
their
lager
for
my
first
pint
the
flavor
is
sweet
not
real
complex
grainy
the
body
is
mediumlight
good
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
went
well
with
my
appetizer
but
it
drinks
like
a
sweeter
and
heavier
version
of
their
lager
othis
is
more
drinkable
than
water
basically
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
style
i
actually
love
this
i
really
want
to
find
a
case
of
this
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
guidelines
to
a
t
but
its
a
loose
interpretation
and
a
good
one
flavors
are
pretty
decent
m
easily
drinkable
the
complexity
is
a
little
lacking
though
the
yuengling
house
flavor
runs
through
the
beer
a
welcome
addition
but
keep
your
expectations
in
check
aside
from
opening
with
an
unplease
toasty
corn
note
this
was
a
fine
smooth
amber
lager
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
becks
oktoberfest
in
that
it
only
kind
of
resembles
the
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
never
stack
it
up
against
a
paulaner
ofest
id
say
its
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
vfw
overall
an
average
beer
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
to
single
it
out
either
doubt
i
would
order
it
again
romas
does
have
guinness
on
tap
and
the
food
is
very
good
some
of
the
best
in
town
o
i
mentioned
this
before
and
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
comparing
but
this
to
me
was
just
a
sweeter
version
of
their
lager
now
dont
get
me
wrong
when
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
drink
i
go
for
a
lager
and
i
think
this
was
a
good
attempt
especially
for
yuengling
to
try
something
different
this
was
the
secret
beer
at
coopers
in
scranton
pa
excitedly
ordered
it
after
finding
it
on
their
facebook
page
i
find
marzens
to
be
average
beers
nothing
ever
blows
me
away
this
was
the
first
ive
ever
had
that
actually
had
some
distintive
taste
to
it
it
was
a
beautiful
orangebrown
color
drank
smooth
and
tasted
fantastic
a
bit
heavy
on
the
tongue
but
all
in
all
probably
the
best
marzen
ive
ever
had
who
knew
yuengling
could
wow
me
with
a
new
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
crisp
and
easy
drinking
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
to
have
again
its
probably
one
of
the
most
sessionable
oktoberfest
beers
ive
tasted
albeit
not
the
most
flavorful
everything
is
here
though
that
youd
expect
for
the
style
but
its
not
overdone
if
anything
understated
easy
drinking
crisp
clean
and
quite
refreshing
a
solid
first
attempt
at
the
style
then
again
i
think
they
do
lagers
quite
well
got
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
draught
horse
on
temple
campus
i
had
no
idea
yuengling
had
come
out
with
an
octoberfest
so
i
decided
to
try
it
definitely
a
good
choice
it
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
mildly
caramel
with
a
bit
of
a
biscuit
quality
this
is
probably
the
more
enjoyable
octoberfest
i
have
had
although
i
havent
had
a
ton
if
different
ones
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
might
be
a
little
bit
light
for
the
style
but
is
perfect
right
now
after
a
morning
commute
that
was
2
hours
instead
of
20
minutes
and
a
slow
tedious
work
day
this
is
one
great
beer
couldnt
ask
for
anything
else
right
now
taste
is
a
coarse
husky
bisquity
graininess
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
overall
medium
bodied
and
pretty
drinkable
for
an
oktoberfest
not
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
biers
but
one
that
you
can
get
pretty
much
anywhere
overall
very
good
session
oktoberfest
this
a
real
smooth
drinkable
beer
im
going
to
be
drinking
this
every
chance
i
get
while
its
available
and
would
buy
it
in
cases
if
they
made
it
o
overall
a
sweet
oktoberfest
style
lager
not
something
for
mass
consumption
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
multiples
but
best
left
in
small
appreciable
quantities
single
purchase
deep
orangy
amber
scents
of
sweet
honey
and
malty
goodness
sweet
earthy
malty
mellowness
that
rolls
smoothly
down
the
back
of
the
pallet
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
latent
yet
not
drowned
by
the
malt
it
breathes
fall
six
from
total
wine
in
plantation
good
oktoberfest
want
a
marzen
but
only
have
6
bucks
this
above
avg
oktoberfest
in
tall
boys
for
the
right
price
would
choose
this
over
any
lowend
marzen
and
cheap
beers
in
general
gansett
gets
better
and
better
drank
from
can
but
have
had
many
not
a
big
fan
of
marzens
but
this
is
the
exception
orange
somewhat
clear
god
carbonation
kind
of
dry
good
hops
citrusy
spicy
hops
almost
ipa
like
a
little
sweetness
my
favorite
of
the
oktoberfest
style
of
beers
have
not
had
a
beer
from
narragansett
that
i
did
not
like
overall
one
of
narragansetts
best
in
my
opinion
and
a
traditional
beer
they
make
quite
well
if
i
were
to
have
an
oktoberfest
party
this
is
one
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
in
quantity
for
guests
a
good
oktoberfest
above
average
o
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
octoberfest
nice
oktoberfest
brew
malty
semisweet
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
with
patchy
foam
islands
like
foam
on
the
sea
first
time
having
this
brand
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
oktoberfest
beers
this
year
appearance
was
a
deep
orange
with
a
lot
of
head
but
settled
quickly
the
smell
was
very
interesting
with
more
sweet
notes
than
i
was
expecting
such
as
vanilla
and
caramel
as
well
as
the
classic
toasted
malt
smell
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
earthy
tones
starting
off
blending
into
sweeter
flavors
into
the
finish
really
enjoyed
this
one
taste
palate
the
flavor
is
classic
german
lager
all
the
way
it
has
a
fresh
bready
maltiness
loaded
with
a
nutty
caramel
and
nougat
like
character
hops
adds
a
light
earthy
dryness
and
bitterness
the
feel
is
right
on
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
among
the
parade
of
marzens
that
hits
the
market
every
fall
it
stands
out
because
of
its
maltforward
character
and
because
its
a
pretty
solid
buy
six
tallboys
for
around
910
the
sweetness
is
there
but
its
far
from
overpowering
i
paired
this
with
pupusas
plantains
and
rice
beans
and
it
was
perfect
i
love
pairing
latin
american
food
with
germanstyle
lagers
id
have
this
again
for
sure
next
time
probably
in
season
found
it
on
sale
among
fall
remainders
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
there
are
others
around
that
are
better
but
still
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
if
it
were
available
here
id
grab
some
when
i
was
in
the
mood
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
caramel
and
candy
sugar
with
hints
of
prune
and
raisin
and
a
touch
of
carmelization
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
brown
sugar
countered
by
a
light
burnt
sugary
taste
light
dried
fruits
and
a
hint
of
earth
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
although
i
went
in
with
low
expectations
its
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
but
its
got
a
wonderful
melanoid
flavor
and
aroma
as
well
as
the
dried
fruits
color
me
pleasantly
surprised
update
2014
the
beer
seems
much
improved
this
year
the
sweetness
is
toned
down
the
hops
balance
the
malt
now
this
is
good
beer
overall
pretty
standard
octoberfest
beer
a
bit
light
and
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
bready
notes
the
beer
pours
a
deep
candied
orange
close
to
amber
the
beer
pours
with
an
aggressive
head
of
yellowing
bubbles
that
form
a
creamy
canopy
over
the
beer
about
two
fingers
high
the
head
lasts
for
quite
some
time
but
when
it
dissipates
splotches
of
fluffy
foam
are
left
behind
in
body
the
beer
is
clean
yet
dark
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
dark
haze
is
present
in
the
beer
but
the
other
side
of
the
glass
is
visible
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
buttery
caramel
malts
cooked
biscuits
and
toffee
swim
thickly
onto
the
nose
and
leave
a
sticky
sense
in
the
nostrils
faint
spicy
hops
and
grass
play
at
the
fringes
of
the
beers
smell
dactyl
seems
to
be
present
in
the
beer
but
i
find
it
inviting
with
the
sweet
smell
of
the
malts
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bready
sweet
with
definite
dactyl
touches
and
a
soft
building
bitter
that
is
slightly
spicy
faint
salinity
can
also
be
found
in
the
malt
character
and
light
acidity
gives
light
tartness
at
the
very
finish
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
off
and
lies
slightly
in
the
sweet
section
though
the
bitters
do
wonders
for
drying
out
the
finish
of
the
beer
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
rich
toffee
and
buttered
biscuits
caramel
maple
syrup
and
rich
breads
play
across
the
palate
as
the
flavor
slowly
swings
to
the
bitter
end
with
dry
grass
spicy
hay
and
faint
green
tea
the
finish
is
smooth
caramel
with
touches
of
bitter
grass
but
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
of
grass
and
soft
dirt
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
creamy
and
syrupy
with
a
mediumplus
body
and
a
middling
carbonation
that
works
to
try
and
keep
the
beers
sweetness
in
check
the
mouth
is
left
sticky
with
saliva
on
the
cheeks
and
a
sticky
sweet
feeling
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
not
the
worst
oktoberfest
by
a
long
shot
it
is
sweet
and
pleasing
and
not
unpleasant
to
put
back
that
paired
with
its
cheap
price
makes
it
actually
desirable
if
you
want
a
marzen
for
cheap
this
is
a
good
option
though
i
still
prefer
jacks
abbys
copper
legend
overall
its
a
real
good
marzen
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
reasonable
price
great
drinkability
overall
its
a
decent
marzen
to
add
to
the
pile
no
harm
no
foul
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
find
this
drinkable
when
cold
and
not
undrinkable
as
it
warms
a
bit
too
grassy
and
lacking
some
crispness
but
good
nonetheless
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
enough
oktoberfest
lager
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
when
you
want
your
german
malts
in
a
16oz
can
look
no
further
i
want
one
of
those
beastly
tankards
gambrinus
is
sportin
on
the
can
xmas
ideas
folks
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
banana
buttery
biscuit
and
a
vague
sense
of
some
sort
of
citrus
rind
the
taste
focuses
on
a
slightly
less
blurry
version
of
the
citrus
and
everything
else
comes
through
watereddown
and
whatnot
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
an
okay
beer
at
best
one
that
seems
like
a
severely
weakened
version
of
the
classic
german
style
its
not
bad
really
but
i
wouldnt
buy
another
if
presented
with
the
opportunity
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
overall
not
bad
not
great
but
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
for
a
somewhat
macro
like
style
lager
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
octoberfest
not
mind
blowing
and
not
the
most
authentic
but
its
an
easy
quaff
that
certainly
hits
the
spot
this
beer
is
on
par
with
pretty
much
all
the
other
narragansett
beers
ive
had
it
isnt
styletopping
stuff
but
you
feel
happy
as
a
consumer
because
you
certainly
got
what
you
paid
for
it
is
of
perfectly
sound
quality
for
a
beer
that
comes
in
the
tall
boy
can
format
at
8
a
6pack
o
another
rock
solid
american
take
on
the
ocktoberfest
style
beer
overall
a
well
rounded
octoberfest
im
spoiled
because
my
goto
oktoberfest
is
now
staghorn
but
this
was
nice
with
good
flavors
and
a
clean
finish
nothing
wrong
here
rjt
might
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
but
not
my
typical
purchase
thin
and
spritzy
but
the
flavor
is
rich
malty
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
brown
sugar
and
dark
cherry
low
hop
presence
shows
up
on
the
swallow
but
doesnt
stay
for
long
in
the
aftertaste
its
overall
very
nice
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
a
lot
o
this
beer
is
pleasantly
smooth
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
to
throw
some
of
these
cans
into
a
cooler
for
a
fall
football
tailgate
party
overall
this
is
decent
fare
and
surprisingly
flavorful
for
a
beer
that
only
clocks
in
at
5
5
abv
a
few
extra
doses
of
grain
and
sugar
would
have
made
for
a
more
potent
drinking
experience
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
lunchtime
brew
that
wont
get
you
hammered
before
the
afternoon
shift
this
is
a
good
candidate
notes
well
its
drinkable
but
very
unique
for
a
marzen

i
like
it
it
tastes
better
and
is
better

than
many
of
the
american
oktoberfests
out
there
overall
this
is
one
of
my
fav
seasonals
overall
probably
my
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
right
behing
ayinger
easy
to
find
but
only
sold
by
the
6
pack
tallboy
cans
love
this
beer
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
could
easily
be
sessionable
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
16
oz
can
of
this
one
a
solid
example
of
the
style
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
beers
i
have
tried
and
all
available
at
very
reasonable
prices
in
cans
dark
copper
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
rises
in
the
glass
aromas
are
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
flavor
profile
is
mostly
toasted
bread
but
enough
of
an
herbal
character
to
call
this
beer
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
good
carbonation
at
roughly
8
99
for
a
6er
of
tall
cans
and
considering
the
fact
that
i
can
sit
here
and
drink
this
all
day
ill
definitely
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
awesome
brew
this
is
a
fairly
decent
and
authentic
brew
for
the
style
with
a
malt
based
body
and
some
buttery
and
toasty
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
bit
of
metalmouth
as
well
the
overall
creaminess
of
the
texture
is
high
just
like
the
flagship
brew
from
these
guys
must
be
something
in
the
water
up
there
for
a
drinkable
sixer
of
tall
boys
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
d
a
solid
oktoberfest
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
was
plenty
easy
to
drink
the
16oz
can
im
sure
these
are
great
for
camping
or
summer
at
the
beach
interesting
that
they
abandoned
the
oktober
and
just
made
it
fest
well
its
a
good
example
of
a
fest
and
you
gotta
love
those
tall
boy
cans
o
not
bad
but
not
great
either
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
okay
i
could
maybe
see
myself
getting
it
again
next
fall
a
nice
deep
clear
orangey
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
that
leaves
some
streaks
of
lace
here
and
there
aromas
of
light
orange
fruitiness
and
cinnamon
laced
pepper
nice
bread
and
toasted
grains
a
touch
of
sazz
hops
spiciness
taste
is
malty
and
smooth
like
a
good
fest
brew
with
caramel
and
toasted
grains
in
large
supply
a
touch
of
butterscotch
in
the
back
with
a
clean
dry
finish
light
bread
flavors
lingering
feel
is
gently
carbonated
with
a
medium
weight
that
gives
an
easy
drinkability
a
nice
version
that
is
quite
satisfying
tasty
and
malty
smooth
and
easy

notes
nutty
notes
some
hop
dryness
late
and
in
the
finish
not
bad
pretty
good
for
beer
in
a
can
but
basically
a
middle
of
the
road
octoberfest
cheers
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
very
affordable
cheers
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
what
impressed
me
more
is
that
a
marzen
in
a
can
is
hard
to
come
by
yet
narragansett
nailed
this
one
on
the
nose
a
very
nice
balance
overall
between
the
hops
and
those
crisp
autumnal
malt
notes
that
make
this
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
autumn
night
in
new
england
at
5
5
its
very
sessionabble
i
only
paid
7
99
for
6
16oz
cans
how
can
you
beat
that
o
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
from
this
resurrected
brewery
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
very
enjoyable
on
this
fall
evening
while
watching
some
baseball
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
in
the
fall
i
definitely
would
while
this
certainly
wasnt
the
most
memorable
ofest
that
ive
ever
had
it
was
a
pretty
good
bangforthebuck
as
i
think
that
i
paid
like
8
for
this
sixpack
of
16
oz
cans
this
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
final
impression
a
solid
example
of
the
style
a
four
pack
would
make
a
good
session
brew
before
a
football
game
i
would
pick
this
over
most
other
oktos
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
a
great
example
of
what
an
autumn
beer
should
taste
like
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
carmel
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
in
terms
of
malt
and
bitterness
the
hops
and
malt
work
together
to
leave
my
tongue
simultaneously
my
perfect
octoberfest
lager
as
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
or
a
malt
bomb
grab
a
gansett
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
soft
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
overall
another
solid
seasonal
from
these
guys
pours
an
orangecopper
with
a
onefinger
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
candied
sugar
toffee
and
hints
of
toasted
grain
flavor
beings
with
a
subtle
kick
of
tart
fruit
apple
pear
and
toasted
grains
before
moving
into
a
silky
smooth
sweet
sticky
and
delicious
caramel
malt
other
notes
of
toffee
and
nuttyness
mix
well
in
the
malt
before
some
spicy
hop
notes
and
more
toasted
grain
to
finish
very
sessionable
oktoberfest
with
an
awesomely
blended
flavor
and
great
mouthfeel
value
you
cant
beat
this
i
found
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
for
like
8
bucks
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
one
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
cover
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
crisp
light
fruity
wheat
the
flavor
delivers
a
fruit
nougat
malt
with
some
flowery
hops
notable
but
mostly
its
a
bright
malt
theme
that
refreshes
with
peppery
carbonation
its
closer
to
light
bodied
than
medium
very
drinkable
yet
packing
a
good
deal
of
flavor
with
a
dry
hop
grain
finish
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
16
ounce
can
pours
medium
amber
light
colored
thick
creamy
white
foam
that
lasts
and
lasts
very
sticky
malty
smell
clean
light
lagery
taste
watery
mild
hop
closes
but
barely
noticeable
so
an
easy
drinker
but
not
terribly
flavorful
good
though
in
retrospect
the
lack
of
a
line
should
have
clued
me
in
that
no
one
wants
this
stuff
onot
bad
i
know
this
style
isnt
know
for
flavor
and
this
beer
no
flavor
even
relative
to
the
style
easy
drinking
though
overall
its
a
solid
marzen
the
fact
that
its
canned
is
a
hell
of
a
bonus
at
1
79
for
a
pint
id
drown
in
this
lager
a
happy
man
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
one
again
another
winning
american
oktoberfest
brew
ive
quite
a
few
as
of
late
this
brew
pours
a
gorgeously
radiant
amber
and
is
capped
with
a
filmy
white
head
that
deposits
a
surprising
amount
of
spotty
lace
upon
the
glass
wall
the
nose
is
fairly
aromatic
offering
biscuity
caramely
notes
and
a
hint
of
general
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
more
directly
nutty
fairly
doughybiscuity
and
has
restrained
sweetness
despite
having
much
of
its
basis
in
sweettype
flavors
such
as
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
shows
a
great
balance
between
creaminess
and
toothy
body
and
refreshing
mouthwatering
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
surprises
ive
had
in
a
while
and
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
more
of
this
clear
amber
with
a
two
inch
cap
of
fluffy
beige
foam
good
head
retention
some
clumpy
and
sticky
lacing
malty
aroma
a
little
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toasted
bread
sort
of
doughy
a
little
sweeter
in
flavour
than
i
expected
bitterness
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
pace
but
still
tasty
bread
and
caramel
light
toastiness
and
faint
leafy
hops
it
seemed
like
a
hint
of
spiciness
or
alcohol
was
present
in
the
finish
along
with
a
lingering
mineral
character
texture
was
nice
smooth
with
some
heft
to
the
body
lowish
carbonation
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
it
poured
from
a
pounder
can
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
copper
coloring
that
is
slightly
hazy
and
has
little
to
no
head
the
beer
has
a
spicy
and
breadtoast
like
aroma
which
is
very
enticing
good
cling
to
the
glass
while
you
drink
the
beer
has
a
sweet
rich
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
heavy
dose
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spicing
that
cuts
the
sweetness
and
warms
you
while
you
drink
the
beer
is
creamy
smooth
in
mouth
and
gives
you
a
malty
tang
on
the
aftertaste
with
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
throughout
the
full
bodied
brew
gives
a
slightly
lingering
creamy
finish
very
flavorful
beer
o
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
ordinarily
come
back
to
but
at
8
for
a
sixpack
of
pint
cans
at
new
york
prices
its
a
solid
value
o
a
good
american
example
of
the
style
a
disappointing
marzenfest
beer
their
maibock
is
a
quality
brew
and
it
would
have
been
nice
to
incorporate
that
beer
into
a
marzen
they
got
the
color
right
but
missed
on
the
flavor
one
of
the
best
american
märzen
ive
had
and
its
a
great
value
go
gansett
othered
not
bad
low
price
and
availability
will
probably
make
this
somewhat
of
a
fall
standard
for
me
o
a
clean
oktoberfest
not
heavily
spiced
but
not
boring
o
this
is
a
great
octoberfest
that
helps
to
bring
in
the
fall
season
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
cool
75
evening
the
smell
and
taste
pretty
much
match
up
with
a
grainy
whole
wheat
sort
of
flavor
to
it
but
there
is
something
lacking
in
the
taste
its
like
a
slight
misbalance
in
the
flavor
and
nothing
really
compliments
each
other
in
it
there
is
a
real
hint
of
spice
too
but
again
it
just
doesnt
mix
correctly
the
aftertaste
is
much
better
than
the
during
taste
with
a
nice
cereal
style
after
taste
to
it
that
is
the
only
part
i
really
liked
about
it
if
i
were
to
describe
this
in
one
word
it
would
be
meh
their
summer
was
a
much
better
seasonal
than
this
my
suggestion
to
this
one
is
drink
it
cold
it
tastes
worse
when
it
is
warmer
a
pretty
darn
good
oktoberfest
which
was
unexpected
from
narragansett
for
me
i
will
certainly
have
this
again
poured
a
brilliant

into

12

for
my
money

the
prettiest

there

malt

light

in
the
nosei
would
like
a
little
more
depth
to
not
only
the
aromas
but
the
flavors
as
well
sweet
and
somewhat
doughy
with
light
drying
in
the
finishwith
a
little
more
crispness
this
would
be
top

beerfor
5
99
a
six
pack
of
16oz
cans
its
awesomenarragansett
is
actually
some
good
shit
o
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
fest
lager
another
solid
seasonal
from
these
guys
also
comes
in
tall
boys
and
is
priced
very
well
solid
fall
beer
and
a
repeat
seasonal
purchase
for
me
a
solid
lager
for
autumn
at
a
good
price
point
just
a
bit
too
sweet
though
wow
what
a
nice
surprise
this
is
a
decent
lager
and
for
8
49
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
fest
is
a
good
one
to
go
to
from
time
to
time
when
in
a
pinch
odpretty
good
maybe
my
least
favorite
of
their
seasonals
but
i
also
do
not
love
the
style
that
much
either
unspectacular
but
for
7
99
for
a
6pack
of
16
oz
cans
i
cannot
complain
not
bad
and
better
than
expected
cant
compete
with
german
and
many
good
domestics
but
not
a
bad
brew
o
another
good
offering
from
narragansett
theyll
rise
again
if
they
can
continue
to
produce
cheap
but
good
beer
like
this
from
a
pounder
can
sweet
mellow
munich
malts
in
the
aroma
caramelly
goodness
nice
thin
layer
of
white
foam
sits
on
top
of
this
slightly
reddish
tinted
looking
beer
not
dark
red
but
like
a
red
ale
light
mellow
smooth
munich
like
malts
come
thru
and
are
followed
up
with
sweet
caramel
all
balanced
very
well
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
lingers
this
beer
has
a
mouthfeel
that
hints
at
creaminess
very
nice
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
well
balanced
did
not
expect
this
judging
from
their
regular
lager
a
real
smooth
easy
drinking
treat
that
come
at
a
good
price
too
perhaps
i
would
like
this
more
if
it
was
later
in
the
season
its
my
first
octoberfest
seasonal
of
the
year
so
maybe
im
adjusting
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
must
agree
with
another
poster
that
it
has
a
macro
feel
to
it
its
solid
and
within
style
i
could
use
a
bit
more
spicenesscomlexity
this
would
go
great
on
a
autumn
afternoon
with
football
on
the
screen
though
worth
trying
but
their
are
better
options
out
there
od
given
the
abv
to
taste
ratio
you
can
enjoy
this
all
day
another
winner
from
narragansett
a
decent
marzen
that
will
probably
please
fans
of
narragansetts
other
offerings
i
can
honestly
say
that
ive
had
better
examples
though
its
a
start
this
poured
out
as
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
light
but
actually
has
some
nice
scattered
bubbles
that
stick
to
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
smells
like
a
typical
german
lager
with
a
minor
crisp
hop
aroma
too
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
caramel
flavor
to
it
but
doesnt
have
too
much
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
having
it
smells
veery
sweet
with
toffee
caramel
aromas
very
malty
and
lightly
hopped
not
very
bitter
tasting
the
taste
follows
through
in
this
fantastic
easydrinking
oktoberfestbier
beers
like
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
anticipate
the
fall
people
complain
aout
the
early
arrival
of
seasonals
but
for
those
of
us
who
adore
the
autumn
cheers
a
lighterbodied
beer
with
sufficient
carbonation
try
it
its
great
give
this
fest
beer
a
try
one
of
the
best
fest
beers
that
is
highly
drinkable
clear
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
descends
into
a
thin
coating
sitting
atop
the
beer
for
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
bread
and
soft
caramel
and
toffee
not
much
hop
presence
the
tastes
follows
with
some
nice
buttery
bread
though
the
taste
isnt
overpowering
at
all
very
subtle
biscuit
caramel
toffee
are
all
present
but
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
not
becoming
overly
sweet
its
light
to
medium
bodied
almost
too
light
and
finishes
slightly
dry
while
the
body
is
a
bit
too
light
for
my
taste
it
also
makes
this
beer
go
down
easily
and
quickly
overall
a
quality
beer
at
a
nice
price
point
that
ill
probably
go
back
to
several
more
times
before
winter
rolls
through
poured
from
16oz
can
clear
orangecopper
color
large
head
that
stayed
well
and
good
covering
of
lace
smell
is
a
little
weak
but
pleasant
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
reminded
me
of
rock
candy
with
hints
of
toffee
smooth
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
that
holds
up
well
oktoberfest
beer
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
to
drink
but
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
i
will
look
for
it
again
from

2011
season
sampled
on
august

2011
it
pours
an
attractive
looking
pale
to
medium
amber
with
a
mammoth
frothy
foamy
head
that
never
completely
fades
away
the
malts
express
themselves
in
grand
fashion
on
the
nose
with
a
more
subtle
beckoning
hop
note
on
the
backside
the
body
averages
about
light
to
medium
the
taste
begins
with
a
strong
caramel
sweetness
and
then
there
is
this
clean
crisp
hopped
finale
to
balance
it
out
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
true
to
the
style
i
liked
it
fantastic
fest
bier
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
it
got
even
better
this
year
recommended
i
have
to
note
that
i
am
really
not
a
fan
of
the
märzen
oktoberfest
style
i
had
to
give
this
a
chance
because
all
of
the
other
narragansett
seasonals
have
been
way
better
than
anticipated
this
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
overall
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
while
not
my
favorite
fest
beer
of
the
season
it
was
definitley
drinkable
dtaste
gone
in
no
time
drinkable
very
aroma
of
caramel
malt
biscuit
grains
and
yeast
and
mildly
aromaticmedicinal
hops
very
clean
smell
taste
is
very
crisp
caramel
and
barley
combined
with
clean
yeast
for
a
biscuity
taste
hops
add
a
slightly
medicinal
and
bitter
edge
matching
the
malt
and
yeast
overall
the
taste
is
extremely
crisp
and
clean
as
well
as
the
feel
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
picks
of
its
style
this
year
tallboy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
thin
whit
head
on
top
dissipates
quickly
no
lace
the
nose
is
pretty
basic
with
hints
of
caramel
toasted
malt
and
some
graham
cracker
the
mouth
is
a
little
harsher
in
carbonation
than
id
like
definitely
spritzy
theres
some
heft
to
the
body
though
flavors
start
out
with
a
sweet
caramel
light
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
clean
finish
this
wasnt
my
favorite
festbier
of
the
season
but
its
not
bad
id
gladly
have
it
again
the
crack
glug
netted
me
two
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
stunning
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
an
interesting
mix
of
grassy
hop
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
big
caramel
taste
on
the
tongue
this
was
pretty
close
to
the
style
although
many
modern
iterations
are
going
for
a
dryer
quality
victory
fest
which
is
what
i
prefer
finish
was
likewise
relatively
sweet
with
a
definite
caramel
taste
that
lingered
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
canned
ofest
either
this
can
looks
fantastic
in
my
fridge
and
this
beer
looks
fantastic
in
my
glass
frothy
airy
eggshellcolored
head
sits
atop
a
beer
that
looks
like
fall
copper
and
reminiscent
of
dark
amber
honey
foam
doesnt
last
long
however
and
is
just
about
completely
gone
by
the
time
i
take
my
first
sip
aroma
is
true
to
the
style
dry
grassy
bready
taste
is
clean
and
malty
sure
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
there
but
the
hops
have
a
little
more
punch
that
your
typical
octoberfest
for
me
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
drinkability
carbonation
is
nice
and
high
and
that
touch
of
hops
bitterness
means
i
could
drink
these
tallboys
all
day
and
night
will
be
sad
when
this
beers
season
ends
md
highly
drinkable
not
your
traditional
oktoberfest
but
a
decent
brew
inexpensive
the
appearance
is
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
small
ring
smell
has
notes
of
malt
hops
sugar
the
taste
contains
more
of
the
malt
with
some
spices
on
the
profile
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
along
with
some
breadiness
to
it
and
earthy
overall
drinkability
on
this
newer
offering
from
the
folks
at
gansett
is
solid
i
wish
that
i
had
bought
some
more
will
have
to
do
exactly
that
in
the
near
future
d
very
drinkable
this
was
a
nice
balanced
oktoberfest
with
a
moderate
abv
and
good
taste
and
feel
taste
starts
with
nutty
malts
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
middle
then
closes
with
peppery
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
some
more
malt
character
and
depth
of
flavor
would
push
this
one
to
the
next
level
i
always
drink
out
of
a
glass
used
for
beer
only
it
was
chilled
to
32
degrees
and
dumped
into
a
wet
glass
great
copper
color
as
it
was
consumed
it
held
the
head
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
flavor
and
smoothness
increases
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
i
think
gansett
hit
a
home
run
now
if
we
could
only
get
this
stuff
in
new
hampshire
a
damn
shame
because
the
look
and
smell
were
very
promising
but
after
that
it
got
pretty
terrible
not
worth
finishing
bleh
16oz
tall
boy
pours
a
dark
burnt
orange
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
some
malts
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
more
sweet
caramel
roasted
malts
as
well
and
some
spice
to
it
hard
to
put
into
words
but
it
just
has
that
great
oktoberfest
beer
taste
certainly
drinkable
and
im
loving
drinking
an
oktoberfest
out
of
a
16oz
can
i
must
admit
that
narragansett
is
my
goto
lager
but
with
the
recent
additions
of
the
porter
and
now
fest
im
hoping
that
this
is
the
start
of
a
trend
of
new
beers
by
gansett
worth
buying
no
question
d
wow
this
is
an
amazing
session
beer
cant
get
over
how
good
this
beer
is
did
this
really
come
from
not
only
a
can
but
a
narragansett
can
definately
worth
the
pickup
an
amazing
macro
take
on
this
style
holy
cow
a
fresh
tasting
ofest
enough
stride
to
pull
away
from
the
middle
of
the
pack
d
this
is
a
decent
american
marzen
from
narragansett
the
macroadjunct
flavor
is
fairly
well
masked
so
it
isnt
a
big
turnoff
for
me
and
these
went
down
easy
and
7
99
for
a
6pk
of
16oz
cans
makes
this
one
a
great
value
a
highly
drinkable
light
amber
brew
with
a
frothy
tan
head
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
a
good
malty
backbone
excellently
balanced
by
the
hops
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
fall
beer
good
going
guys
d
nice
easy
going
beer
love
the
price
7
99
for
sixer
of
16oz
cans
finishes
a
little
harsh
on
the
throat
but
otherwise
could
see
anyone
being
able
to
down
a
couple
not
an
amazing
octoberfest
by
any
means
but
an
amazing
fest
for
the
price
drinkability
is
just
average
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
id
want
a
sixpack
of
these
d
gansett
fests
finest
attributes
are
its
clean
look
smooth
feel
and
fine
balance
of
flavors
the
5
5
abv
puts
it
right
in
a
sessionable
territory
and
the
tallboys
are
a
bonus
that
said
it
either
tastes
like
it
was
made
with
adjuncts
or
just
not
the
same
quality
of
malts
youll
taste
in
more
established
american
marzen
lagers
overall
its
a
great
value
and
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
prost
to
ri
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
very
long
time
the
taste
is
not
where
it
needs
to
be
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
with
a
malty
back
bone
definitely
a
touch
of
caramel
but
with
a
spicy
bite
and
an
overprocessed
feel
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
metallic
flat
and
unappealing
it
loses
some
of
its
sweetness
in
the
finish
as
as
the
settles
in
the
reddish
caramel
flavors
are
decent
but
compromised
by
some
of
the
off
flavors
towards
the
finish
as
with
most
macro
type
lagery
beers
the
taste
starts
to
diminish
when
the
beer
warms
and
some
adjunct
maybe
presenting
itself
mouthfeel
is
workin
on
this
one
it
has
a
smooth
sweet
flow
very
drinkable
its
like
a
more
flavorful
bigger
bodied
gansett
it
does
taste
too
simaler
to
the
original
tho
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
would
a
sixpack
of
16
oz
cans
is
going
for
about
8
here
in
new
england
very
affordable
for
a
quality
brew
yea
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
hacker
oktoberfest
but
stands
on
its
own
as
a
great
addition
to
the
fall
beer
offerings
found
on
new
england
shelves
nice
to
see
a
new
ofest
rather
than
yet
another
pumpkin
ale
as
i
pointed
to
early
i
like
drinking
this
beer
and
it
almost
just
reminds
me
of
a
regular
tall
can
enjoyable
beer
but
not
up
there
in
the
top
fest
beersnor
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
while
buying
it
d
easy
and
sweet
ill
enjoy
this
beer
this
autumn
as
a
homebrewer
i
can
appreciate
an
unbalanced
beer
for
its
uniqueness
but
for
a
marketed
product
the
flavor
profile
should
be
more
cohesive
16oz
can
served
in
a
tumbler
pours
a
translucent
copper
with
a
loose
one
inch
creamcolored
head
pockmarked
with
ringlets
and
tiny
craters
head
slowly
recedes
into
a
fairly
consistent
slick
of
foam
leaving
delicate
strands
and
slashes
of
lacing
but
exhibiting
weak
adhesion
nose
reveals
a
light
malt
profile
perhaps
some
caramel
a
mild
aromatic
hops
quality
and
a
trace
of
grain
and
citric
acid
taste
follows
nose
some
sweetness
expressed
at
the
start
with
a
light
citrus
character
close
behind
and
a
dry
somewhat
cleansing
light
hop
character
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
but
an
assertive
carbonation
gives
it
a
crispness
and
a
little
more
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
märzen
not
your
typical
malty
sweet
example
of
the
style
but
solid
and
quite
drinkable
a
fairly
accessible
offering
for
those
new
to
this
style
of
beer
overall
i
found
this
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
like
i
said
when
i
get
a
good
oktoberfest
it
always
helps
on
the
homefront
slight
head
on
the
pour
which
ends
up
dissipating
surprisingly
minimal
in
carbonation
which
allows
some
of
the
flavor
to
come
out
in
a
smoother
body
so
not
a
bad
thing
in
essence
has
a
heavy
bready
lager
yeast
feel
here
with
a
slight
toffee
note
in
there
a
good
beer
for
when
the
weather
turns
to
fall
a
great
beer
for
beerfest
o
solid
though
lacking
complexity
a
puretasty
example
of
the
style
actually
this
didnt
seem
very
revolutionary
a
nice
orthodox
marzen
very
smooth
and
tasty
overall
as
always
great
example
of
the
style
from
revolution
cant
believe
they
didnt
call
this
oktoberfist
85
b
overall
good
ones
like
this
make
me
want
to
stick
with
this
pretty
drinkable
style

is

all
around
good
balance

of

and
moderate
yeast

flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
not
my
style
but
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
creating
a
full
and
mostly
foamy
mouthfeel
that
manages
to
never
come
across
as
fizzy
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
coating
the
palate
and
lips
o
i
have
not
had
many
new
marzens
this
season
so
far
but
i
think
this
one
really
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
for
me
smooth
yet
a
good
malt
bill
meets
a
nice
rustic
nutty
graininess
really
digging
alot
of
what
revolution
is
putting
out
and
this
is
no
different
o
cloyingly
sweet
with
some
odd
vanilla
and
cola
notes
ive
never
experienced
with
this
style
seemed
more
like
a
pop
than
a
beer
with
all
that
sweetness
o
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
although
sweetness
might
get
a
bit
cloying
after
a
couple
of
these
slight
citrus
flashes
by
and
the
bready
toasted
malt
base
rolls
through
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
toast
marmalade
lightly
bitter
noble
hops
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
feel
easily
drinkable
may
not
be
the
most
traditional
but
it
tastes
great
o
got
this
for
free
and
was
my
drink
of
choice
after
work
pretty
nice
with
some
sausage
and
rice
but
nothing
i
would
buy
unless
its
on
tap
just
to

good
not
must
have
hard
to
review
this
since
it
is
exactly
what
you
would
think
and
should
be
what
makes
it
special
for
me
is
it
is
local
and
fresh
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
seek
out
but
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
its
not
bad
but
it
seems
to
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
and
almost
seems
forgettable
compared
to
the
other
ones
on
the
market
in
my
opinion
the
body
rests
at
medium
with
a
good
flow
off
a
consistent
carbonation
ofeering
a
nice
bite
while
smoothness
is
likewise
consistent
appears
a
deep
copper
hue
with
off
white
cream
head
fine
even
spaced
lacing
looks
great
aroma
has
caramel
malts
herbal
hops
kicking
in
the
backend
with
a
complementary
air
of
very
refreshing
beer
lager
in
a
can
im
game
especially
microbrewed
o
fest
semi
sweet
malts
bring
nutty
earthy
notes
between
the
malts
and
euro
hops
im
very
excited
to
sink
my
teeth
into
the
rest
of
the
5
cans
i
have
from
the
sixer
i
purchased
slick
oily
yet
clean
and
refreshing
all
in
one
gulp
im
a
big
fan
of
this
chicago
brewed
lager
i
do
know
they
have
a
decent
german
heritage
in
chi
town
this
could
have
been
brewed
by
a
direct
descendant
or
a
rebel
revolutionary
who
knows
how
to
brew
good
beer
im
a
fan
of
the
brewery
brewery
and
brews
that
they
produce
this
is
all
around
quality
go
try
some
if
you
see
the
tuba
touting
lederhosen
clad
gent
next
to
the
fist
of
the
revolutionary
great
artwork
complements
great
beer
go
try
some
folks
overall
this
definitely
met
my
expectations
and
consider
it
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
fresh
soft
malt
flavor
with
a
good
noble
hops
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
classic
my
favorite
domestically
produced
oktoberfest
5
bones
a
bomber
and
it
singlehandedly
justifies
my
stein
purchase
a
winner
overall
meh
this
is
a
pass
i
will
be
honest
this
isnt
really
a
style
i
go
crazy
over
but
i
try
my
best
to
review
such
styles
with
an
open
mind
and
a
generous
nature
in
terms
of
scoring
to
be
fair
there
is
nthing
offensive
in
this
beer
but
nothing
that
wows
me
either
o
really
enjoy
this
oktoberfest
by
revolution
sweet
but
to
to
sweet
with
crisp
finish
served
on
tap
at
whole
foods
schaumburg
appearance
is
a
deep
reddish
orange
with
striking
clarity
dense
white
head
leaves
thin
layer
that
retains
heavy
lacing
nose
is
full
of
deep
grains
notes
of
lager
yeast
caramel
an
earthy
hint
of
spicy
grain
in
the
vein
of
rye
or
pumpernickel
taste
is
full
of
wonderful
fall
flavors
plenty
of
bready
malts
with
deep
caramel
notes
and
a
hint
of
spice
bitter
hops
come
through
and
balance
out
the
malts
with
an
earthy
component
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
maybe
a
tad
high
on
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
and
tasty
version
of
a
marzen
worth
a
try
as
are
all
rev
brews
is
this
a
good
rendition
on
a
german
oktoberfest
or
a
really
wellmade
amber
ale
the
mild
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
hop
character
leans
me
toward
amber
ale
but
its
well
worth
trying
o
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
but
it
doesnt
wow
me
very
solid
malty
sweetness
and
the
light
hop
backing
adds
another
depth
of
flavor
at
4
99
this
a
great
value
and
would
buy
again
if
i
was
in
the
right
setting
o
a
clean
and
pretty
traditional
oktoberfest
nice
job
guys
somehow
this
is
my
first
revolution
beer
from
the
bottle
go
figure
it
pours
a
clear
coppertawny
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
light
honey
light
rye
toast
mild
spicy
and
earthy
hops
and
a
tiny
touch
of
deep
fried
chicken
skin
yeah
this
is
what
came
to
mind
i
dunno
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
hops
are
slightly
stronger
and
lean
a
bit
more
floral
now
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
is
tossed
in
absentmindedly
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
solid
ofest
nothing
spectacular
or
eyeopening
but
something
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
beneath
a
tent
at
some
big
party
of
some
kind
o
a
very
good
example
a
fester
should
be
stronger
than
a
normal
amber
lager
but
it
has
to
retain
a
specific
feel
to
it
many
oktoberfests
get
stronger
without
the
hops
and
end
up
very
sweet
the
others
raise
the
bitterness
but
the
hops
flavor
goes
away
and
you
are
left
with
harshness
this
one
is
a
good
balance
it
is
designed
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
after
all
solid
mouth
feel
and
the
beer
went
excellent
with
my
food
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
fest
beer
as
it
is
tasty
and
easy
to
session
this
is
a
good
and
solid
oktoberfest
while
there
are
grain
tones
to
it
they
dont
dominate
and
instead
we
get
some
malty
goodness
clear
copper
in
color
served
with
a
thin
bit
of
white
head
decent
lacing
caramel
malts
and
herbal
hops
a
slight
metallic
tinge
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
all
malt
caramel
toffee
toast
maybe
some
earthy
hops
but
the
hops
arent
the
star
of
the
show
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
but
the
heavy
malts
really
round
things
out
overall
decent
but
i
didnt
order
a
second
o
drinkable
decent
for
the
style
can
drink
again
with
no
complaints
d
its
a
solid
and
truetostyle
oktoberfest
offering
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
style
but
fairly
enjoyable
all
the
same
if
youre
into
oktoberfest
beers
or
even
darker
lagers
this
would
be
worth
trying
carbonation
is
perfect
at
a
medium
to
high
level
and
mouthfeel
would
be
right
there
if
the
finish
was
dryer
drinkability
is
very
high
though
as
it
should
be
given
a
beer
that
should
be
drank
in
1l
glass
steins
pours
a
light
copper
orange
body
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
caramel
and
grain
clean
yeast
aroma
tastes
grainy
up
front
later
bready
and
malty
honey
faint
toast
and
apricot
moderate
body
with
lively
carbonation
this
is
tasty
and
solid
but
not
up
to
par
with
german
versions
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
bring
on
the
oompah
overall
very
solid
i
like
a
bit
more
carmel
and
malt
in
my
octoberfest
solid
oaktoberfest
had
it
fresh
on
draft
this
year
it
was
great
not
great
lakes
though
the
beer
is
more
bitter
than
the
smell
and
most
octoberfests
for
that
matter
indicate
less
smooth
and
far
more
dry
i
dont
detect
any
buttery
oak
notes
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
good
bodycarbonation
rjt
pours
a
bright
orange
nice
and
clear
with
thin
white
head
which
leaves
tons
of
lacing
the
nose
has
all
of
the
familiar
malty
notes
i
would
expect
in
an
oktoberfest
with
the
addition
of
of
some
toasted
oak
which
adds
a
nice
dimension
some
slightly
sweet
malty
notes
are
present
along
with
that
bone
dry
lager
yeast
character
taste
is
absent
of
any
sweetness
as
all
the
malt
is
influenced
strongly
by
the
oak
character
the
oak
lends
a
very
dry
notes
to
the
toasted
malt
character
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
character
here
although
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
a
little
lack
in
the
flavor
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
tastes
like
a
kings
hawaiian
dinner
roll
very
good
i
like
this
octoberfest
beer
its
lighter
and
crisper
than
some
of
the
more
maltiersweeter
versions
the
beer
was
clear
golden
with
thin
head
that
is
leaving
a
mild
lace
the
body
is
lighter
than
most
but
good
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
some
might
consider
this
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
for
the
style
but
thats
expected
and
most
welcomed
from
firestone
walkers
lagers
delicious
wheres
my
maßkrug
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
is
true
to
the
style
one
of
the
most
impressive
things
here
for
me
is
the
cleanliness
of
the
lager
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
it
provides
a
nice
base
for
the
other
things
to
shine
but
i
dont
think
the
malts
are
utilized
enough
here
flavorwise
seems
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
a
marzen
to
me
as
well
a
solid
brew
but
doesnt
hit
some
of
the
styles
primary
points
solid
not
exactly
true
to
style
but
a
nice
take
nonetheless
insanely
drinkable
and
almost
refreshing
novel
overall
a
relatively
hoppy
marzen
but
still
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
grainy
or
malty
dominance
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
which
leads
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
is
very
grainy
and
almost
like
yeast
or
bread
dough
linger
an
above
average
märzen
oktoberfest
that
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
still
well
made
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
oktoberfest
or
malty
beers
o
very
drinkable
but
nothing
screams
oktoberfest
to
me
one
of
the
better
brews
thus
far
from
firestone
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
a
fan
of
them
this
beer
is
very
hearty
and
has
the
right
amount
of
punch
does
not
taste
like
the
traditional
octoberfest
brews
but
it
is
pretty
woody
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
considered
octoberfest
it
does
have
an
aroma
of
malts
and
barley
a
small
amount
of
head
and
lace
and
the
right
amount
of
zesty
appeal
on
the
tongue
relatively
smooth
and
all
expectations
exceeded
overall
the
most
underwhelming
oktoberfest
beer
ive
ever
had
3
75
o
nice
oaky
influences
subtle
yet
enjoyable
and
appreciable
fresh
noble
hop
flowers
very
drinkable
not
compromising
the
main
principal
associated
with
style
clean
flavor
crisp
off
the
tongue
begging
for
more
abv
is
kept
within
guidelines
for
multiples
nice
noble
influence
and
bonus
of
oak
aging
if
you
are
expecting
a
parabola
or
sucaba
then
you
may
be
dissappointed
the
flavor
is
not
as
big
or
bold
nor
is
suppose
to
be
the
drink
is
kept
more
traditional
with
an
oaky
twist
o
very
well
done
flavor
is
screaming
while
also
tamed
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
overall
i
like
this
best
marzen
ive
had
in
a
long
time
but
its
the
only
marzen
ive
had
in
a
long
time
of
coarse
fw
hits
the
style
perfectly
an
excellent
lager
and
one
that
i
want
to
keep
coming
back
to
another
reason
why
they
are
probably
my
favorite
brewery
they
do
the
big
bruiser
styles
well
but
the
simpler
styles
like
this
and
pivo
are
amazing
as
well
its
decent
but
kind
of
disappointing
especially
coming
from
fw
3
45
overall
a
pretty
hohum
oktoberfest
and
a
disappointment
from
firestonewalker
its
a
bad
sign
when
your
marzen
is
more
hoppy
than
your
hoppy
pilsner
wouldnt
buy
again
and
with
the
price
i
paid
for
the
sixer
its
a
definite
one
and
done
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
color
nice
carbonation
nice
creamy
onefinger
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose

and
sweet
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
nice
hop
bitterness
thrown
in
medium
body
nice
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
brew
nice
to
see
a
different
firestone
walker
around
here
o
3
75
definitely
unique
by
aging
it
on
oak
its
very
inviting
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
a
bit
of
sulfur
dripped
off
this
at
first
pour
but
slowly
dissipated
as
i
waited
for
the
head
to
recede
earthy
mineral
water
rich
bready
pilsner
malt
and
a
hint
of
spicy
floral
hop
the
flavor
is
clean
rich
bready
light
caramel
malts
with
barely
a
touch
of
spice
medium
body
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
tastes
better
than
it
smells
i
could
drink
these
but
pales
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
imports
overall
i
didnt
get
the
feel
of
a
marzen
bier
with
this
one
it
has
the
flavor
and
profile
of
a
west
coast
ipa
albeit
a
mild
one
thats
not
to
say
that
this
beer
isnt
enjoyable
it
certainly
is
refreshing
and
tasty
smooth
and
clean
tasting
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
to
end
very
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
the
profile
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
would
recommend
to
those
who
like
their
ipa
s
on
the
mild
side
d
firestonewalker
oaktoberfest
offers
some
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
i
love
how
they
kept
to
style
while
adding
their
own
little
touches
it
really
comes
through
in
the
final
product
which
is
a
nice
brew
overall
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
i
had
this
year
but
the
price
may
keep
me
away
from
a
repeat
purchase
bottle
t
graham
cracker
light
hop
spicing
and
low
applewood
notes
and
grape
musk
essence
of
cinnamon
very
nicely
balanced
between
fullflavored
toastiness
and
a
fainter
malt
sweetness
barely
noticeable
caramel
a
little
too
pils
forward
for
my
liking
in
a
marzen
with
just
a
touch
of
sulfuric
minerality
but
a
good
tasting
beer
nevertheless
really
much
closer
to
a
dortmunder
3
755
overall
oktoberfest
being
my
favorite
style
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
bit
of
a
letdown
especially
for
the
price
paid
a
little
over
10
for
six
its
thinner
and
more
bitter
than
i
would
want
for
this
style
i
personally
prefer
a
more
malty
thick
and
potent
brew
in
my
oktoberfest
that
being
said
the
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
and
far
from
providing
a
bad
experience
just
overpriced
in
my
area
anyway
and
undermalted
a
solid
wellbalanced
märzen
beer
that
packs
malt
and
hop
flavors
in
an
easy
drinking
package
o
nice
on
par
with
victory
festbier
but
not
as
good
as
ayinger
oktober
festmarzen
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
this
beer
base
on
hype
i
had
heard
and
how
much
i
like
other
firestone
walker
beers
still
very
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
o
pretty
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
one
id
heard
it
was
hopped
more
heavily
than
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
the
hops
compliment
the
malts
very
nicely
since
this
is
closer
to
a
wiesn
fest
i
dont
miss
the
big
melanoidin
bavarian
amber
märzen
carries
but
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
the
plus
side
its
not
a
roasty
or
nutty
beer
at
all
relying
on
good
malt
and
hop
combo
to
make
up
a
pretty
good
brew
looks
great
smells
nice
and
tastes
excellent
o
a
really
solid
beer
its
nothing
mindblowing
but
i
think
that
speaks
more
to
the
style
than
the
beer
itself
this
is
super
smooth
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
definitely
something
good
to
kick
off
fall
a
basic
oktoberfest
with
a
slight
oak
twist
still
quite
tasty
o
decent
marzen
the
oak
is
subtle
but
there
taste
palate
the
flavor
has
nice
malty
sweetness
up
front
with
well
balanced
hops
finishing
it
off
the
malt
offers
notes
of
light
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
touch
light
nuttiness
the
hops
balance
the
malt
sweetness
with
spicy
and
earthy
herbal
bitterness
and
dryness
the
palate
feels
right
on
its
smooth
nicely
carbonated
and
very
drinkable

grassiness
and
noble
hops
bittering
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
while
i
cant
say
that
i
particularly
enjoy
the
big
caramel
notes
associated
with
the
style
this
is
a
bit
lacking
i
was
anticipating
that
the
oak
would
help
attenuate
the
caramel
malts
and
add
an
additional
dimension
however
this
is
a
bit
too
dull
for
my
liking
o
not
a
very
good
marzen
over
hopped
and
too
light
in
body
and
taste
closer
to
a
pilsner
wouldnt
buy
again
tastes
of
caramel
nut
light
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
bit
more
complex
for
this
style
than
i
am
used
to
but
very
good
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
very
light
bodied
marzen
maybe
not
what
i
look
for
but
a
solid
enjoyable
brew
lots
of
toasted
biscuit
and
sweet
malts
to
absorb
in
the
flavor
and
it
ends
clean
and
crisp
but
is
this
anything
special
nope
pours
with
a
2
finger
head
and
is
golden
orangeyellow
beer
is
clear
some
head
remains
could
have
a
cold
but
i
do
not
get
much
on
the
nose
bread
earth
oak
with
a
spice
cannot
put
my
finger
on
which
one
kicking
on
the
back
end
and
more
bread
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
good
beer
overall
a
bit
disappointed
although
not
really
since
i
didnt
have
much
expectations
anyways
american
breweries
just
dont
know
how
to
make
a
good
oktoberfest
they
always
seem
to
think
it
needs
lots
of
candy
sweetness
and
reddish
malts
and
bitter
herbal
grassy
hops
the
good
german
breweries
are
nice
lagered
characters
with
light
malts
that
speak
for
themselves
dont
need
all
the
extra
things
added
into
it
to
be
fair
though
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
most
american
ofests
which
are
loaded
with
caramel
and
munich
malts
and
super
sweet
but
tts
barely
enjoyable
actually
even
if
this
wasnt
supposed
to
be
an
oktoberfest
3
5
bottle
this
looks
smells
and
tastes
closer
to
a
pilsner
wtf
firestone
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
nothing
really
outstanding
its
taste
is
light
and
subtle
clean
and
crisp
it
misses
the
mark
a
little
for
me
due
to
what
i
perceive
as
an
overly
drying
finish
which
i
believe
affects
its
drinkability
in
a
negative
way
some
folks
may
enjoy
that
aspect
of
course
and
hell
maybe
its
more
traditional
as
festbiers
go
i
somehow
missed
this
one
last
year
so
lets
rectify
that
early
this
year
it
pours
a
cleark
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
sweetgrass
light
white
bread
and
a
touch
of
dried
honey
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mildly
sweet
biscuit
grass
very
light
honey
and
the
softest
touch
possible
of
hard
water
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
seemingly
traditional
ofest
one
thats
decidedly
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
in
a
single
sitting
the
verdict
not
bad
hoppier
than
expected
though
i
shouldnt
be
too
surprised
coming
from
firestone
as
it
warms
the
hop
bite
subsides
and
the
marzen
character
begins
to
appear
fresh
and
refreshing
especially
for
the
style
well
made
case
worthy
overall
this
is
solid
but
is
lacking
the
toasted
malts
associated
with
oktoberfest
styles
o
quaff
city
this
is
an
awesome
octoberfest
delicious
all
the
way
around
and
so
easy
to
drink
give
me
liter
mugs
of
this
all
day
pours
a
lovely
amber
true
gold
no
orange
looks
like
a
maibock
fat
head
of
cream
colored
foam
that
lasts
and
leaves
lace
nose
is
malty
and
has
a
the
beginings
of
honey
on
it
but
stops
short
of
any
real
honey
scent
in
fact
it
is
the
lightest
oktoberfest
i
have
ever
seen
light
in
color
light
in
scent
it
has
a
bit
of
hop
herbal
on
it
fresh
grass
its
cool
like
ti
has
the
dew
on
it
taste
is
light
and
smooth
not
really
toasty
bread
but
again
more
like
a
maibock
light
sweet
malt
that
is
the
sweetness
of
the
grain
and
only
verges
on
a
light
honey
dry
white
bread
rather
than
crusty
dark
bread
dry
crisp
malt
thats
round
and
gives
a
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
fresh
herbal
hops
come
up
to
accent
this
one
and
offer
balance
it
finishes
dry
crisp
impeccably
smooth
and
you
cannot
help
but
wonder
how
they
managed
to
expose
only
the
inherent
sweetness
of
the
grain
so
expertly
the
hops
leave
a
touch
of
bitter
to
linger
and
some
grain
to
echo
on
the
back
palate
unique
and
superb
in
texture
and
in
style
and
presentation
to
the
palate
the
oak
becomes
mor
eprominent
as
ti
warms
and
it
is
quite
dry
beautiful
amber
orange
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
fizzy
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
light
toasted
and
caramel
malt
fresh
earthy
herbal
hop
and
grassy
aromas
medium
bodied
with
a
full
slightly
oily
feel
through
the
middle
followed
by
a
tangy
crisp
hop
bite
near
the
end
bready
and
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
and
through
the
middle
followed
by
crisp
herbal
hops
from
the
middle
to
the
end
finished
crisp
and
dry
with
a
lingering
herbal
hop
bitterness
marzens
arent
a
tongue
twisting
taste
bud
numbing
style
ive
heard
and
read
of
a
lot
of
disappointment
with
this
particular
beer
almost
as
if
firestone
walker
was
going
to
reinvent
the
style
well
they
didnt
they
made
areally
good
marzen
pours
bright
amber
with
fluffy
two

white

lots
of
caramel
malts
and
crisp
floral
noble
hops
in
the
nose
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
with
sweet
caramel
malts
cut
by
bright
earthy
and
floral
hops
very
clean
lager
yeast
finish
this
definitely
fills
the
oktoberfest
void
left
by
great
lakes
when
i
moved
to
the
west
coast
o
not
a
great
offering
by
firestone
honestly
though
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
style
so
this
one
may
knock
the
socks
off
of
the
oktoberfest
lovers
out
there
o
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
couple
of
victorys
veteran
hoppy
offerings
namely
hop
wallop
and
prima
pils
i
was
convinced
hw
was
all
german
ingredients
after
the
first
few
times
having
it
this
isnt
far
off
from
that
which
i
wasnt
anticipating
seeing
this
for
what
it
is
i
could
session
the
schnitzel
out
of
it
very
nice
a
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
i
have
to
say
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
tad
better
but
still
decent
plenty
of
carbonation
here
too
combined
with
the
hops
this
beer
is
all
kinds
of
zingy
d
a
very
nice
take
on
a
style
i
dont
tend
to
generally
enjoy
should
make
a
great
beer
garden
staple
for
the
month
of
september
just
enough
bitterness
to
sharpen
up
the
flabby
malt
definitely
the
best
märzenstyle
brew
i
have
had
maybe
ever
who
knew
that
a
dose
of
oak
was
the
missing
ingredient
to
make
an
oktoberfest
really
drinkable
the
body
was
nicely
full
without
being
heavy
and
had
a
slightly
sticky
finish
drinkability
was
excellent
i
could
see
grabbing
a
liter
or
three
of
this
beer
overall
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
poured
into
a
fremont
brewing
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
flavor
is
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
nice
touch
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
light
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
a
nice
marzen
style
lager
with
good
malt
balance
and
surprisingly
rich
tasting
for
the
abv
nicely
done
overall
good
not
great
is
the
best
descriptor
at
7glass
there
are
better
options
here
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
this
fall
but
i
wanted
it
to
be
oaky
like
its
name
misleadingly
suggests
pours
a
pumpkin
orange
color
into
a
10
oz
globe
with
a
robust
white
head
that
settles
slowly
clear
liquid
lots
of
bubbles
great
nose
freshly
fallen
leaves
vanilla
sweetness
caramel
malt
german
yeast
and
a
hint
of
wood
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
interesting
than
the
nose
where
everything
is
subtle
even
the
german
malts
very
little
residual
sugar
though
which
i
love
and
a
fast
finish
even
for
a
lager
vanilla
is
light
i
really
wish
this
was
oaked
or
more
so
if
it
is
because
i
dont
taste
it
and
i
think
it
would
lend
itself
well
to
a
good
oaking
still
a
great
beer
though
light
and
drinkable
i
could
pound
on
these
firestones
regular
beers
are
as
good
as
their
whales
bomb
stuff
here
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
a
solid
american
take
on
the
style
in
my
opinion
ontap
and
the
library
ale
house
santa
monica
ca
back
in
september
2012
the
beer
appeared
a
darker
amber
color
that
was
clear
with
a
nice
onefinger
head
that
was
pretty
light
the
beer
gave
off
a
very
nice
robust
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
biscuit
the
taste
was
as
expected
from
a
marzen
a
big
malt
flavor
perhaps
toasted
and
no
bitterness
to
note
the
beer
had
a
lighter
moderate
feel
but
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
right
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
overall
a
fine
beer
and
one
that
i
will
hope
to
get
next
fall
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
the
flavor
profile
is
good
but
not
mindbending
this
is
that
sit
down
shut
up
and
enjoy
the
beer
type
of
brew
great
session
beer
m
appropriately
light
and
drinkable
but
at
times
it
seems
like
the
beer
is
a
lot
bigger
than
its
abv
drink
im
pretty
thankful
i
didnt
go
for
the
12
pint
or
a
tulip
size
pour
for
me
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
guess
o
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
this
beer
firestone
walker
normally
goes
a
lot
bigger
on
their
flavors
and
this
beer
was
a
little
bland
for
my
taste
pours
a
nice
mediumdark
orange
color
not
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
but
theres
a
slight
biscuitymalty
aroma
taste
follows
suit
but
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
also
come
through
finish
is
dry
leaving
the
drinker
reaching
for
another
quick
sip
its
not
the
most
remarkable
beer
from
this
stellar
brewery
but
a
good
take
on
the
style
nonetheless
the
aroma
was
rather
light
and
muted
some
decent
malts
and
a
ton
of
bready
like
flavors
but
overall
just
a
touch
too
light
for
me
crisp
clean
feel
which
was
nice
and
adequately
carbonated
but
again
just
a
touch
too
light
to
really
be
effective
smooth
flavor
started
with
a
light
hint
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
earthy
grains
this
quickly
floated
away
though
and
the
only
thing
left
was
a
nice
touch
of
biscuit
like
flavor
that
linger
for
a
moment
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
its
simple
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
my
glass
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
a
great
fall
session
seasonal
i
would
really
like
to
see
it
in
six
packs
bottle
shared
at
the
september
iteration
of
the
santa
cruz
tasting
series
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
sticky
white
head
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
toasted
cereal
authentic
german
malty
flavor
toasty
grains
and
a
nice
mineral
quality
to
it
clean
on
the
palate
nothing
too
exciting
but
well
made
o
not
so
remarkable
but
plenty
enjoyabledrinkable
the
use
of
paulaner
yeast
learned
after
finishing
most
of
the
glass
is
most
apparent
in
the
finish
there
is
a
notable
brassymineral
quality
in
the
finish
light
enough
in
strength
to
enjoy
several
pours
of
without
too
many
ill
effects
overall
decent
oktoberfest
really
somewhere
between
12
lager
and
12
ale
d
the
flavors
werent
overly
impressive
but
this
was
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
d
oaktoberfest
is
a
pretty
runofthemill
märzen
decent
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
very
faint
aroma
of
malts
tough
to
identify
anything
in
particular
the
flavor
is
pretty
mild
as
well
some
woody
malts
and
light
hints
of
spice
theres
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
some
light
tingly
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
lowish
abv
but
i
wasnt
too
inspired
by
this
maybe
it
was
a
bad
keg
but
there
was
so
little
flavor
and
what
was
there
just
wasnt
inspiring
poured
into
a
ceramic
mug
at
the
festival
so
i
couldnt
judge
the
appearance
properly
but
i
did
see
this
beer
in
pitchers
and
it
looked
pretty
nice
a
good
medium
brown
beer
tapped
from
a
large
barrel
sweet
malts
with
a
good
side
of
spice
low
bitternes
and
not
much
oak
especially
for
a
beer
named
oaktoberfest
but
there
were
some
good
earthywood
characterists
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
to
date
had
this
on
tap
as
well
but
it
really
shined
from
the
cask
mouthfeel
and
subsequently

with

was
very
clean
with
a
whiff
of

palate
had
the

as
well
with
a
sweet
oak
sort
of
dryness
in
the
background
overall
though
it
was
still
somewhat
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
nicely
balanced
between
being
the
hops
and
malts
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
this
was
a
damn
good
märzenvienna
lager
its
actually
a
mix
of
the
two
styles
this
was
perfect
for
the
festival
i
would
happily
order
it
again
excellent
even
if
it
really
isnt
to
style
i
wish
this
beer
was
sold
at
oktoberfest
on
tap
at
woodstocks
pizza
in
isla
vista
pretty
random
find
but
they
do
sell
the
fw
private
label
beers
as
well
orangegold
color
with
a
creamy

the
aroma
has

the
flavor
has
plenty
of
rich
toasty
malt
flavors
with
almost
perfect

mediumlight
on
the
palate
this
is
quite
reminiscent
of
the
oktoberfests
that
they
actually
serve
in
munich
which
are
much
more
drinkable
than
the
darker
marzens
that
get
shipped
over
here
make
no
mistake
though
this
is
a
more
complex
and
flavorful
beer
than
the
versions
that
the
major
munich
breweries
are
making
im
a
bit
confused
on
the
oak
part
my
roommate
says
he
tasted
oak
but
i
didnt
pick
out
anything
definitive
and
firestones
website
doesnt
say
anything
about
oak
in
the
production
process
regardless
this
is
another
awesome
firestone
beer
and
one
that
i
can
see
anyone
loving
poured
golden
with
a
small
white
head
nose
was
slightly
hoppy
and
grainy
on
the
taste
i
was
really
missing
the
oak
but
it
did
have
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
rather
dry
and
crisp
overall
it
was
pretty
good
eventhough
its
not
my
style
expected
more
oak
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
on
tap
at
san
diego
brewing
company
pours
a
vibrant
goldorange
the
small
head
has
decent
retention
and
lacing
my
nose
is
greeted
by
an
earthy
and
slightly
piney
hop
aroma
sweet
bread
nutmeg
very
grainy
i
spent
a
few
minutes
trying
to
pinpoint
the
dominant
characteristic
in
the
malt
profile
of
oaktoberfest
and
decided
it
was
grain
the
beer
smells
very
grainy
the
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
dont
think
there
is
any
pumpkin
flavor
in
it
aromas
of
nutmeg
clove
some
vanilla
and
possibly
allspice
give
it
pumpkin
ale
characteristics
these
are
not
primary
characteristics
of
the
aroma
but
were
detectable
nonetheless
the
mild
bitterness
up
front
is
quick
to
introduce
caramel
and
grainy
malt
flavors
the
taste
is
of
oak
nutmeg
and
vanilla
and
a
faint
hop
bitterness
concludes
the
show
the
carbonation
is
good
easy
to
put
away
a
glass
of
this
one
but
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
nice
brew
a
good
solid
refreshing
marzen
beer
was
expecting
a
little
more
oak
profile
but
like
it
the
way
it
is
d
oktoberfests
are
meant
to
be
very
drinkble
beers
alchohol
seemed
low
enough
guessing
about
5
or
6
that
anybody
could
have
this
for
a
night
of
seasonal
celebration
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
firestone
though
i
didnt
find
it
to
have
a
great
drinkability
i
was
really
sipping
on
this
beer
more
than
just
drinking
it
still
its
an
interesting
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
nice
offering
from
firestone
expected
a
marzen
from
the
name
but
plesantly
surprised
with
this
american
twist
on
a
vienna
also
cool
was
that
a
dollar
from
each
of
the
pints
drank
today
went
to
a
charity
for
ms
would
love
to
drink
again
but
do
not
know
how
likely
that
is
with
its
limited
availability
and
all
recommended
a
truly
exceptional
beer
here
overall
this
was
a
really
good
beer
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
this
is
my
first
authentically
german
oktoberfest
so
perhaps
us
americans
are
just
doing
it
wrong
overall
definitely
not
the
best
by
weihenstephaner
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
a
good
switch
from
the
darker
märzen
beers
and
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
go
down
in
quantity
o
seems
a
little
light
both
in
color
and
flavor
overall
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
full
flavor
oktoberfest
that
will
satisfy
anyone
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
might
not
be
a
marzen
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
bought
a
single
but
i
should
have
sprung
for
a
six
pack
hard
to
believe
this
is
5
8abv
clear
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
low
retention
with
some
lacing
toasted
malt
aroma
very
light
bodied
for
an
oktoberfest
and
soft
on
the
palate
but
with
all
the
other
characteristics
i
love
about
the
style
including
a
dry
finish
a
very
enjoyable
unique
take
on
the
style
that
almost
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
helles
and
an
oktoberfest
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
clear
light
amber
golden
pour
very
nice
head
lacing
and
retention
light
slightly
sweet
nose
with
notes
of
pear
over
biscuit
almost
light
medium
body
with
a
touch
of
smoothness
above
average
carbonation
that
provides
a
nice
effervescence
throughout
the
flavor
profile
is
laid
back
but
has
a
very
nice
balance
and
a
bit
of
complexity
it
begins
with
pear
and
a
touch
of
lemon
then
flows
into
a
rather
toasty
biscuit
light
sweetness
the
middle
effervesces
into
a
slight
bitterness
over
a
receding
biscuit
the
finish
approaches
crisp
and
has
a
noble
hop
flavor
note
over
a
slightly
dry
character
a
solid
oktoberfest
but
not
world
class
such
as
great
lakes
hackerpschorr
or
ayinger
lightish
body
and
effervescence
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
thirst
quencher
beer
than
a
sit
back
and
relax
with
it
brew
too
bad
i
really
like
the
brewery
and
all
the
other
beers
ive
of
theirs
ive
had
but
this
one
is
weak
overall
drink
this
if
you
like
pale
lagers
german
or
czech
pilsners
its
just
spicier
and
lightly
more
malty
than
a
standard
lager
i
know
that
its
authentic
but
his
does
not
taste
special
rather
it
tastes
like
just
another
lager
to
me
o
im
sure
its
one
of
the
standards
for
the
style
but
not
as
highly
rated
as
others
in
the
style
im
enjoying
it
and
will
more
so
with
some
oktoberfest
fare
in
a
couple
minutes
bought
and
drank
in
thailand
sept
29th
2014
o
this
is
lighter
than
i
expected
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
selections
not
my
favorite
but
an
easy
sipper
and
hey
its
fall
prost
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
a
tad
fruity
and
bready
with
just
the
lightest
touch
of
hops
this
is
one
of
the
better
marzenstyle
beers
that
ive
hadit
isnt
too
cloying
and
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
i
could
certainly
drink
this
all
day
overall
a
pretty
good
german
lager
different
than
the
typical
marzen
with
more
of
a
spicy
hop
presence
like
a
pilsener
served
on
tap
at
a
chester
nj
octoberfest
a
lighter
bodied
marzen
from
the
get
go
pale
yellow
color
some
amber
white
foam
nose
and
malty
are
all
malt
lightly
sweet
small
hap
back
smooth
easy
drinker
solid
not
baaaad
o
color
isnt
as
dark
as
some
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
outside
the
color
scope
if
you
do
a
google
image
search
for
marzen
clean
flavors
with
some
complexity
going
on
and
no
faults
everything
you
want
in
an
oktoberfest
but
not
more
nice
malt
character
with
some
lemon
and
toasted
grains
it
wasnt
too
sweet
that
was
nice
not
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
here
a
bit
more
of
a
floralhoppy
aroma
and
taste
than
i
was
expecting
from
an
oktoberfest
a
bit
surprising
clean
and
crisp
not
too
heavy
but
i
would
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
from
a
pilsner
or
helles
thebestbeerihave
everhad
mouthfeel
light
medium
in
body
medium
in
carbonation
between
the
wheats
and
the
lagers
this
is
a
very
clean
clean
flavor
with
no
strong
lingering
presence
very
nice
and
palate
quenching
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
marzen
and
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
find
this
to
be
more
helles
lager
like
than
anything
i
didnt
mind
the
taste
and
aroma
but
it
just
wasnt
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
clean
crisp
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
drink
if
i
wanted
a
good
marzen
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
unique
it
was
the
perfume
and
herbal
aspect
was
unique
and
while
it
was
a
little
weird
at
first
i
found
myself
liking
it
the
more
i
drank
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
true
to
style
its
just
not
what
i
expect
from
the
style
and
im
pretty
sure
there
would
be
no
way
i
would
guess
this
is
a
marzen
if
i
tried
it
blind
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
but
not
if
i
wanted
a
straight
up
marzen
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
though
i
think
this
is
worth
giving
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
good
and
true
to
style
marzen
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
confused
by
this
beer
i
didnt
mind
it
its
just
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
think
this
might
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
if
i
was
drinking
traditional
marzens
all
day
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
or
my
favorite
marzen
but
i
think
its
decent
in
its
own
way
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
but
its
just
not
what
i
think
of
as
a
marzen
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
i
didnt
expect
a
brewery
that
is
this
so
old
and
traditional
to
make
such
a
different
take
on
the
style
this
is
just
excellent
i
may
have
to
compare
all
other
oktoberfest
beers
to
this
one
then
again
this
may
be
a
bit
too
pilsnerlike
for
most
brassy
gold
with
a
one
finger
white
head
decent
lacing
and
like
most
german
made
maerzens
a
spicy
noble
hoppiness
is
front
and
center
but
here
it
is
broad
and
deep
and
harmoniously
integrated
into
the
aroma
the
taste
is
restrained
balanced
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
german
oktoberfest
beers
overall
its
not
the
best
thing
weihenstephaner
has
brewed
but
its
very
drinkable
to
me
its
more
of
a
munich
hell
than
oktoberfest
but
thats
ok
its
a
very
good
hell
about
on
par
with
a
spaten
lager
it
goes
very
good
with
food
particularly
bratwurst
which
puts
it
up
a
notch
in
my
book
nothing
outstanding
but
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
finishes
on
a
more
bitter
note
than
a
bunch
of
lagers
pours
a
clear
straw
color
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
citrus
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hop
and
euro
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
marzen
oktoberfest
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
citrus
hint
of
hop
and
euro
yeast
overall
great
appearance
good
aroma
decent
feel
decent
body
and
decent
blend
o
4
this
is
very
good
and
refreshing
beer
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
a
bit
darker
with
more
body
and
roasted
malt
flavors
like
a
transition
from
typical
summer
beers
to
dark
winter
beers
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
really
good
pilsner
with
more
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
still
a
good
beer
just
different
than
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
that
is
much
lighter
in
color
than
other
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
had
with
a
good
4finger
foamy
white
head
that
had
lots
of
lacing
when
sipped
very
surprised
at
both
actually
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
and
is
of
grains
yeast
with
a
hint
of
citrus
even
more
so
going
on
with
the
taste
that
has
a
hint
of
honey
herbal
and
bread
yeast
very
tasty
and
goes
down
very
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
medium
bodied
as
well
as
medium
carbonation
fantastic
brew
and
the
best
oktoberfest
style
beer
to
date
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
very
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
a
little
bit
a
head
lasts
on
the
surface
aided
by
a
steady
carbonation
stream
the
aroma
is
light
but
distinct
grassy
biscuits
earthy
with
the
hops
dominating
the
aroma
is
in
lockstep
but
a
bit
more
maltforward
with
the
hops
coming
in
towards
the
finish
the
body
is
lighter
but
not
watery
and
theres
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
but
barely
noticeable
a
really
good
lager
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
i
expectprefer
oktoberfests
to
be
maltier
while
this
has
some
malt
presence
its
simply
too
light
and
unassertive
seems
like
they
were
going
for
a
balanced
approach
which
they
succeeded
in
but
some
styles
are
better
a
little
unbalanced
eg
ipas
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
however
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
as
it
shows
the
the
apparently
broad
range
in
which
oktoberfests
can
be
made
80100
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
pilsner
still
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
what
i
expect
in
an
oktoberfest

overall
the
beer
is
very

quite
good
a

lighter
than
most
marzen

beers
ive
had

very
good
a

better

in

style
i
enjoyed

quite
a
bit
though

a
very
light
colored
octoberfest
beer
delicious
sweet
malt
forward
profile
in
the
nose
and
flavor
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
its
not
a
stellar
oktoberfest
look
for
a
local
brew
you
will
be
happier
prost
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
ofest
after
only
drinking
sam
adams
ofest
prior
anyway
it
looks
tastes
and
feels
much
more
like
a
traditional
pilsner
which
isnt
bad
just
lacking
the
heavier
caramel
malt
qualities
im
used
to
expectations
aside
this
is
a
very
tasty
excellent
beer
overall
great
allseasons
beer
i
love
that
big
malt
flavor
great
in
october
but
also
great
in
every
other
month
weihenstephaner
oktoberfestbier
is
a
solid
marzen
however
to
me
it
does
not
measure
up
to
their
hefeweissbier
or
korbinian
i
love
this
brewer
and
expected
much
much
more
from
this
beer
its
light
not
a
lot
of
flavor
quaffable
for
sitting
at
a
beer
table
during
oktoberfest
but
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
of
brew
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
off
for
being
a
marzen
style
beer
the
beer
has
some
funk
to
it
also
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
absent
of
hop
like
flavors
and
it
beer
has
some
present
o
easily
the
lightest
example
of
a
marzen
i
have
encountered
almost
a
borderline
helles
i
just
barely
see
it
in
the
grain
profile
but
just
missing
that
slight
tip
towards
a
nuttierricher
malt
region
which
i
love
so
much
about
this
style
overall
damn
good
oktoberfest
beer
but
can
you
expect
anything
else
from
a
german
brewery
if
not
possibly
the
german
brewery
good
strong
flavors
of
hops
and
malt
nicely
balanced
into
an
extremely
good
beer
overall
a
great
beer
but
not
very
oktoberfest
like
much
paler
and
closer
to
a
helles
than
marzen
o
middling
beer
and
certainly
not
even
close
to
the
best
weihestephan
has
to
offer
but
not
bad
an
unpleasant
experience
overall
o
not
my
favorite
from
weihenstephaner
its
good
but
the
flavors
initially
fight
for
room
in
your
mouth
before
they
all
blend
together
its
good
but
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
still
an
enjoyable
drinker
though
and
easy
to
put
back
overall
a
superb
oktoberfest
loved
it
o
enjoyable
beer
for
the
style
it
looks
a
bit
like
a
typical
oktoberfest
but
it
is
still
quite
flavorful
there
is
a
mild
nose
of
wet
straw
with
bits
of
honey
whiffs
about
the
taste
is
subtly
sweet
and
a
bit
grassy
with
some
shy
candy
corn
motes
no
hoppiness
no
maltiness
a
quenching
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
leaves
the
palate
refreshed
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
es
ist
gut
nicht
wahr
o
clean
flavored
lager
nice
malty
grain
flavors
this
is
an
excellent
oktoberfest
well
balanced
fruit
zesty
and
perfect
for
the
autumn
rjt
overall
different
than
what
im
used
to
for
the
style
more
along
the
lines
of
a
euro
pale
lager
than
a
marzen
even
so
this
doesnt
do
anything
new
or
exciting
except
that
they
were
probably
doing
this
decades
if
not
centuries
before
anyone
else
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
good
overall
o
probably
the
lightest
ofest
ive
had
in
terms
of
color
at
least
but
its
definitely
still
solid
and
easy
to
quaff
great
price
as
always
definitely
worth
trying
o
im
adjusting
to
the
popularity
of
the
lighter
ofests
they
actually
seem
more
in
tune
with
what
was
served
in
the
munich
tents
some
years
ago
when
i
attended
great
compliment
to
an
early
fall
day
refreshing
in
the
warm
sun
robust
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
cool
of
the
evening
would
buy
again
in
quantity
overall
super
bummed
by
the
skunkyness
seriously
why
does
this
still
happen
i
understand
using
a
certain
bottle
locally
i
guess
but
if
you
are
importing
it
use
a
dark
bottle
come
on
i
bet
fresh
this
is
a
great
beer
however
after
a
couple
of
months
in
a
light
bottle
being
imported
overseas
just
slightly
above
average
meh
overall
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
very
good
pilsner
and
offers
a
nice
reprieve
from
the
more
conventional
oktoberfest
style
beers
this
time
of
year
o
i
expected
a
little
more
from
my
favorite
german
brewery
but
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
oktoberfest
id
still
prefer
hacker
pschorrs
great
lakes
and
victorys
offerings
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
look
for
a
marzen
o
decent
märzen
and
unique
enough
to
stand
apart
from
the
crowd
not
my
favorite
but
ill
usually
get
a
bottle
for
oktoberfest
if
i
see
it
overall
kind
of
like
a
different
take
on
the
helles
lager
but
not
even
close
to
what
i
expected
pity
since
i
love
this
brewery
o
not
my
favorite
marzen
but
certainly
not
a
bad
one
either
b
overall
a
thin
marzen
style
brew
maybe
a
slightly
stronger
lager
with
a
touch
of
vienna
i
prefer
the
maltier
or
hoppier
types
grain
with
a
solid
quilt
of
whites
a
little
light
colored
for
a
marzen
smells
like
a
good
pilsner
grain
corn
sweet
pils
malt
just
a
hint
of
hop
i
like
the
nose
very
much
but
not
under
this
style
flavor
is
bitter
some
bits
of
corn
and
grain
a
little
bit
of
anise
almost
in
the
back
light
bodied
with
higher
carb
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
rubbing
tongue
feel
this
is
the
least
impressive
of
weihenstephans
beers
the
beer
is
misrepresentative
of
marzen
imo
but
maybe
in
munchen
they
play
by
different
rules
all
around
tasty
refreshing
and
easydrinking
lager
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
based
on
style
id
say
this
is
slightly
above
average
honestly
id
probably
rather
have
something
like
a
sam
adams
oktoberfest
which
is
tough
to
say
about
a
beer
made
by
weihenstephaner
o
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
surprising
oktoberfest
beer
from
germany
lighter
in
color
bigger
hop
character
and
more
pilsner
malt
character
than
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
and
it
it
quite
complex
overall
a
very
decent
brew
but
very
different
from
the
americanized
caramel
bombs
o
crisp
clean
and
on
point
a
great
beer
for
early
autumn
that
gives
a
nice
mild
bitterness
the
spice
profile
is
various
and
elegant
while
the
yeast
doesnt
overpower
but
nestles
nicely
in
the
background
this
is
a
hefty
marzen
various
spices
mixed
in
with
light
spicy
hops
to
balance
the
honey
sweetness
not
quite
what
you
typically
look
for
style
wise
but
tasty
nonetheless
this
is
not
a
marzen
this
is
a
munich
helles
lager
in
the
fest
bier
style
oktoberfest
beer
comes
in
variety
styles
including
marzen
and
helles
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
munich
and
consistently
delivers
in
the
bottle
at
home
there
is
weihenstephaner
and
there
is
everything
else
prost
atmosphere
is
excellent
great
head
a
constant
foam
blanket
and
a
light
yet
persistent
beer
ring
nose
is
bready
with
bitter
and
sweet
fruit
notes
and
some
honey
nicely
balanced
yeasty
pungent
and
sweet
characteristics
accentuated
with
some
sweet
and
fruit
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
it
may
not
be
the
most
diverse
offering
from
weihenstephan
but
its
nevertheless
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
easy
to
sit
with
for
hours
on
end
after
an
intense
week
with
sours
and
bitter
ales
this
is
refreshing
and
highly
welcoming
i
want
more
american
brewers
to
deliver
beers
like
this
in
their
oktoberfest
offerings
hoppy
yes
but
also
fruity
well
carbonated
and
juicy
definitely
might
pick
this
up
again
at
the
crazily
low
price
summary
this
stuff
is
terrific
definitely
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
a
little
disappointing
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
levels
but
ultimately
a
really
nice
beer
and
six
packs
are
super
cheap
o
excellent
for
a
warmer
fall
day
love
a
german
fest
in
the
fall
prost
b
pretty
damn
hoppy
for
a
style
that
emphasizes
a
lack
of
hops
good
malt
character
and
tasty
overall
but
not
what
you
expect
in
a
marzen
o
this
beer
is
light
enough
to
drink
all
day
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
the
appearance
and
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
appealing
yet
the
aroma
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
oi
a
classic
example
of
the
modern
wiesn
style
oktoberfestbier
a
great
beer
for
exploring
continental
malts
german
melanoidins
and
noble
hop
characters
overall
as
stated
above
probably
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
only
because
i
tend
to
favor
pale
lagers
over
amberviennastyle
lagers
crisp
refreshing
and
with
a
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
reminds
me
more
of
a
dortmunderstyle
of
strong
pale
lager
if
they
called
this
a
pilsner
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
one
on
the
whole
a
great
beer
i
would
drink
this
year
round
overall
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
so
sublime
im
going
to
get
it
in
my
fridge
soon
this
is
now
one
of
my
new
favorite
oktoberfest
its
right
up
there
with
great
lakes
and
warsteiner
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
overall
apple
is
the
main
thing
i
relate
this
beer
to
i
respect
weihenstephaner
very
much
and
if
i
had
only
one
of
their
brews
to
choose
from
id
reach
for
their
classic
hefeweizen
but
this
is
a
respectable
beer
d
this
was
a
nice
wheat
beer
but
not
very
heavy
for
a
fest
beer
it
had
a
clean
and
crisp
scent
and
taste
and
body
it
had
a
mellow
finish
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
great
for
the
first
day
of
oktoberfest
but
not
very
unique
from
weihenstephans
hefeweissbier
wonder
if
this
is
getting
a
little
past
its
prime
but
still
a
nice
oktoberfest
overall
a
nice
lager
pilsener
with
a
few
different
malts
and
hops
than
one
would
normally
see
a
nice
one
for
every
now
and
then
i
think
say
once
a
year
in
october
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
odworks
well
enough
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
it
works
well
enough
an
average
beer
about
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
majority
of
märzen
or
oktoberfest
beers
i
try
this
one
is
easily
the
worst
of
the
five
weihenstephaner
beers
i
have
tried
to
date
it
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
table
and
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
not
what
i
expected
in
am
oktoberfest
lacks
malt
complexity
and
theres
an
off
flavor
the
more
i
taste
and
smell
it
the
more
i
think
its
a
yeast
issue
mouthfeel
is
good
fairly
sessionable
od
a
nice
really
easy
drinking
and
flavourful
weihenstephaner
beer
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
and
smoothness
this
hits
the
spot
for
a
thanksgiving
afternoon
sort
of
beer
hmmmm
i
had
to
check
the
bottle
label
to
make
sure
i
was
drinking
a
maerzen
great
lager
but
off
style
but
thats
ok
not
all
maerzens
have
to
taste
the
same
poured
a
dark
golden
like
a
pilsner
not
typical
pils
or
maerzens
aomas
and
flavors
maybe
a
combo
of
the
two
never
the
less
its
a
well
done
lager
crisp
flavorful
and
refreshing
i
would
drink
again
and
i
cant
beleive
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
this
beer
is
really
similar
to
a
good
pilsner
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
oktoberfest
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
i
was
only
mildly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
guess
i
had
super
high
expectations
considering
their
hefeweisbeir
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
from
the
weihenstephaner
offerings
i
am
usually
impressed
but
not
with
this
one
it
seems
merely
average
this
beer
is
indeed
unique
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
as
if
it
was
a
babyoffspring
of
paulaners
oktoberfest
and
their
wiesn
it
is
worth
a
taste
but
not
sure
if
i
would
recommend
overall
i
was
expecting
more
maltiness
nutty
notes
and
color
to
the
beer
this
beet
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
pilsner
or
later
a
bit
dissapointkng
and
think
that
things
may
have
been
bottles
incorrectly
at
the
brewery
overall
it
would
make
for
a
world
class
pilsner
but
its
fairly
lacking
for
an
oktoberfest
not
sure
how
they
call
it
a
festbier
because
it
just
isnt
but
nonetheless
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
because
itll
make
for
good
drinking
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
marzen
overall
too
easy
to
drink
at
6
percent
oi
really
shouldnt
complain
about
how
it
isnt
very
marzeny
because
id
have
no
trouble
drinking
a
pitcher
of
this
in
a
biergarten
actually
my
only
complaint
is
that
im
not
sure
id
pay
126
pack
for
it
again
given
its
nature
o
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
which
put
me
off
at
first
but
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
im
going
to
have
to
buy
more
of
this
stuff
its
a
nice
easydrinking
fest
beer
that
has
no
objectionable
qualities
whatsoever
i
would
like
a
darker
amber
color
and
stronger
malt
flavor
but
this
is
still
very
nice
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
not
a
great
marzenoktoberfest
i
have
definitely
had
much
better
and
this
one
is
overpriced
as
well
but
nonetheless
enjoyable
and
good
to
have
a
lot
of
overall
hard
to
rate
this
one
as
it
is
not
what
i
usually
find
in
a
marzen
but
still
a
well
brewed
enjoyable
lager
but
what
ever
it
wont
stop
me
from
drinking
more
thats
for
sure
o
not
too
bad
maybe
not
your
more
traditional
german
style
oktoberfest
but
it
stays
relatively
clean
and
doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
sugary
malt
sweetness
o
doesnt
really
go
down
well
it
starts
off
fine
but
is
dissapointing
overall
food
match

that
carbonation
hit
really
sneaks
up
on
you
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
not
much
going
on
at
first
golden
color
with
little
action
when
its
poured
but
then
you
smell
it
and
its
subtle
yet
super
inviting
noble
hops
up
front
and
then
a
lot
of
sweet
mild
malts
then
you
drink
and
say
ahhh
because
its
refreshing
as
hell
crisp
clean
beer
with
a
great
bitterness
resembling
a
czech
pilsner
with
a
little
more
sweetness
from
the
malt
not
as
malty
as
most
fest
beers
but
who
cares
its
delicious
and
theyre
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
they
tell
you
what
a
fest
beer
is
honey
gold
color
with
slight
amber
hue
frothy
hungy
fresh
looking
head
the
aroma
and
taste
are
exactly
in
line
with
each
other
very
straightforward
bready
and
biscuity
with
a
mild
hop
presence
that
makes
it
so
drinkable
all
the
big
corporate
brewers
would
be
really
well
served
to
follow
these
guys
as
they
still
seem
to
make
beers
the
way
theyre
supposed
to
be
made
this
is
the
german
way
o
very
drinkable
traditional
german
festbier
could
easily
drink
a
few
overall
uniquely
light
for
the
style
bready
malts
noble
flowery
hops
and
a
scent
that
screams
german
lager
in
the
taste
a
mix
of
pale
and
munich
malts
lending
toffee
and
buttered
biscuit
like
flavor
herbal
leafy
hops
and
lager
yeast
giving
a
very
clean
impression
bitterness
is
mild
for
a
more
or
less
even
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
thin
and
carbonation
is
slight
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
whole
review
and
drinking
festbier
in
its
entirety
took
6
minutes
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
of
the
lighter
variety
which
i
prefer
the
overdone
caramel
sweet
bombs
of
the
u
s
need
a
gut
check
once
in
a
while
very
unnoticeable
carbonation
but
the
malt
creates
a
full
and
comfortable
mouth
feel
clear
straw
color
with
a
frothy
little
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
very
nicely
light
malt
and
fruity
scents
a
pleasant
light
flowery
hop
ending
o
ill
assume
that
its
a
pioneer
of
the
style
just
because
weihenstephaner
brews
it
and
german
breweries
know
all
concerning
lagers
especially
marzens
in
my
opinion
however
im
kind
of
surprised
its
good
but
it
doesnt
blow
my
hair
back
it
might
be
because
ive
had
too
many
other
marzens
that
were
all
pretty
similar
whereas
this
is
the
only
one
that
has
really
strayed
away
from
what
an
octoberfest
is
to
me
not
an
oktoberfest
but
of
the
lighter
festbier
type
still
this
remains
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
one
that
i
hadnt
had
before
but
will
definitely
add
to
my
list
to
pick
up
next
season
note
that
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
and
thus
far
prefer
the
ontap
not
sure
if
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
as
straightforward
as
this
no
frills
grainy
lager
with
a
moderate
hop
presence
as
a
festbier
it
works
well
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
utterly
poundable
with
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
to
it
id
be
happy
to
order
a
liter
or
two
with
a
plate
of
brats
sounds
like
heaven
to
me
although
i
think
i

surprisingly
o
i
really
really
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
have
been
trying
to
get
my
hand
on
as
many
of
this
style
as
i
can
this
year
and
this
one
has
been
by
far
my
favorite
this
beer
is
incredibly
addicting
i
would
suggest
picking
up
a
couple
of
six
packs
and
enjoying
throughout
gameday
for
a
perfect
combination
of
the
season
o
a
good
beer
though
a
bit
atypical
for
the
style
it
seems
more
pilsnerlike
than
a
marzen
still
its
a

o
not
the
traditional
oktoberfest
that
im
used
to
but
its
a
tasty
beer
that
can
be
had
in
large
quantities
o
another
good
product
from
bayerische
weihenstephan
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
at
oktoberfest
prost
its
not
bad
and
its
got
some
character
to
it
but
there
isnt
much
going
on
here
for
me
oi
was
excited
when
i
found
the
weihenstephan
oktoberfest
this
might
be
my
favorite
brewery
out
of
germany
and
its
always
exciting
to
try
something
new
from
them
for
this
reason
i
had
very
high
expectations
those
expectations
were
met
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
it
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
tastes
on
this
one
are
great
but
subtle
i
only
bought
one
bottle
i
might
have
to
go
out
and
find
a
lot
more
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
best
german
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
o
more
of
the
wiesn
style
festbier
than
what
most
think
of
as
the
traditional
oktoberfest
maltier
beers
made
here
in
the
states
yet
another
ofest
finally
getting
sampled
this
year
took
me
long
enough
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
white
bread
light
lemon
zest
flowers
wheat
very
light
green
apple
and
grass
its
light
and
airy
but
still
pretty
pleasant
the
taste
holds
notes
of
spicy
rye
light
caramel
greens
flowers
grass
orange
zest
wheat
and
light
black
pepper
im
actually
surprised
the
malts
came
through
as
well
and
as
strongly
as
they
did
here
given
the
lightness
of
the
look
and
smell
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
overall
a
bit
of
a
contradictory
ofest
here
but
one
that
generally
succeeds
in
pleasing
o
a
decent
mild
summer
beer
pale
malts
apple
like
cider
taste
sweetness
and
a
tea
like
bitterness
out
back
its
interesting
for
sure
to
consider
this
a
marzen
is
bold
it
is
clean
light
crisp
so
that
works
with
the
flavors
but
not
a
marzen
in
my
book
o
i
have
to
say
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
festbiers
but
this
didnt
quite
seem
like
an
oktoberfest
beer
to
me
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
trying
again
overall
drinkability
not
bad
i
could
have
another
one
with
the
right
meal
and
indeed
i
think
thats
the
strength
of
this
beer
meant
to
have
a
lot
of
it
with
food
at
an
oktoberfest
event
by
itself
its
just
okay
nothing
terribly
special
nice
hop
character
but
i
miss
the
deeper
malt
profile
i
get
with
some
us
marzens
but
with
the
right
food
i
think
this
beer
would
shine
in
this
case
the
right
food
was
not
italian
not
sure
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
if
i
see
it
with
german
food
on
tap
i
might
try
it
again

just
the
same
o
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
maybe
my
expectations
are
skewedamericanized
but
i
always
took
oktoberfest
beers
to
be
richer
than
this
just
feel
like
im
drinking
a
wellbalanced
easydrinking
pilsner
which
is
fine
but
not
what
i
signed
on
for
o
a
very
poundable
beer
could
probably
drink
several
liters
of
this
it
pours
a
very
light
and
watery
bright
very
clean
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
it
smells
of
pale
german
malts
biscuit
malts
grains
and
has
a
very
subtle
bitter

finish
the
flavors
are
very

the

it
is

malts
light
honey

with
a
slight

it

flavors

its
really
really
light

subtle
for
being
fresh
this
drinks
in
a
really
dull
manner
its
also
very
very
watery
i
can
see
this
being
popular
during
a
festival
but
alone
this
beer
is
pretty
weak
its
definitely
not
on
par
with
weihenstephaners
other
offerings
pours
a
very
clear
light
goldenyellow
a
white

lots
of

is
mineral
cracker

some
crisp
noble

asserts

on

aftertaste
this
brew
is
balanced
moreso
on
the
hop
side
imo
good
clean
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
decent
drinker
but
nothing
spectacular
from
the
okoberfest
style
this
is
a
pale
gold
beer
with
not
much
head
at
all
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
the
body
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
a
lot
of
earthy
grain
malt
like
smells
the
flavor
to
me
was
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
marzen
it
was
grainy
like
with
a
lot
of
earth
after
tones
the
body
was
like
a
marzen
just
because
felt
more
full
than
a
pils
a
pretty
good
rendering
in
the
more
golden
fruit
colored
fest
beers
this
is
a
bottle
from
last
year
but
it
has
maintained
golden
on
the
the
very
light
orange
yellow
nose
is
pollen
mineral
a
bit
of
freshness
from
hopping
palate
is
chalk
dry
to
the
point
that
it
feels
like
sodium
salty
hints
sweet
overtone
that
somehow
blend
into
the
works
nice
carbonation
munich
and
honey
o
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
cheers
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
pilsners
and
even
though
this
brew
is
classified
as
a
marzen
i
still
felt
like
this
was
more
like
a
pils
big
time
grassy
notes
on
the
palette
which
is
not
my
favorite
thing
in
beer
the
more
i
drank
of
this
brew
the
worse
it
got
normally
when
a
good
beer
gets
warmer
the
flavors
get
better
this
one
wasnt
like
that
i
was
very
happy
once
i
finished
this
because
i
was
afraid
that
i
wasnt
going
to
this
drinks
like
a
nice
summery
beer
but
if
i
want
a
marzen
ill
reach
for
ayinger
or
something
else
pour
yields
a
goldenhued
brew
that
is
mostly
transparent
the
head
is
white
and
sticks
around
for
just
a
bit
before
falling
down
to
a
thin
cap
slight
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
comprised
of
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
some
very
very
light
hopping
the
flavor
is
again
whitebread
crust
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
caramel
flavoring
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
and
goes
down
smoothly
even
though
nothing
about
it
is
all
that
remarkable
especially
considering
its
source
on
tap
from
a
restaurant
in
arlington
va
and
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
golden
yellow
with
medium
small
white
head
nicely
carbonated
aroma
gives
off
sweet
malts
taste
is
incredible
malt
honey
grain
a
slight
bit
of
roast
mild
spicy
hops
and
roast
keep
this
balanced
but
this
is
a
malt
forward
beer
palate
is
malty
sweet
and
crisp
as
can
be
hops
bitterness
balanced
perfectly
with
the
hints
of
roast
malt
to
keep
this
from
being
cloying
overall
an
excellent
beer
this
isnt
what
everyone
considers
an
oktoberfestmarzen
but
more
a
slightly
stronger
maltyer
version
of
a
helles
with
the
slightest
hint
of
roast
a
festbier
or
wiesen
carbonation
is
solid
feel
is
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
grainy
character
needs
a
bit
more
residual
sweetness
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
this
is
not
up
to
the
usual
very
high
standards
of
this
brewery
and
couldnt
hold
up
against
a
mediocre
czech
lager
this
is
up
there
with
the
easiest
of
beers
to
drink
not
my
favorite
from
weihenstephaner
but
i
can
see
why
they
made
this
their
fest
beer
these
will
knock
back
easily
should
lead
to
a
good
night
prost
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
clean
and
smooth
presence
overall
this
is
another
top
notch
beer
from
one
of
the
worlds
best
overall
a
b
my
pour
resulted
in
a
thick
foamy
cap
of
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
nose
had
a
pleasant
maltiness
not
too
sweet
more
subtle
than
i
expected
frankly
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
lager
sweetness
accompanied
by
a
grassy
hoppiness
finish
was
likewise
pleasantly
sweet
very
clean
in
its
aftertaste
d
this
is
not
an
ofest
the
blue
white
bavarian
chevrons
product
placement
with
other
ofests
time
of
year
etc
all
had
me
thinking
that
this
would
be
malty
rich
this
is
a
bigger
than
everyday
beer
but
not
a
marzen
weihenstephaners
original
is
a
helles
and
this
seems
to
be
a
bigger
fest
version
a
sort
of
extra
special
helles
or
helles
bock
or
maibock
a
very
nice
beer
and
you
have
got
to
like
the
partying
nuns
on
the
six
pack
not
your
run
of
the
mill
marketing
d
highly
drinkable
it
would
be
very
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
pints
whether
or
not
its
true
to
style
its
still
a
tasty
offering
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
germany
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
5
8
being
just
about
perfect
for
the
body
and
depth
this
beer
has
overall
would
i
buy
this
again
no
id
buy
their
original
because
it
was
very
similar
weihenstephaner
festbier
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
youll
have
no
problem
handling
the
pintsized
bottles
it
comes
in
d
not
bad
not
great
but
slightly
below
what
id
expect
coming
out
of
the
weihenstephaner
brand
d
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
d
meh
my
journey
through
weihenstephaner
seems
to
be
the
reverse
of
most
people
i
scored
their
original
lower
than
most
and
now
im
scoring
their
festbier
higher
than
their
original
seems
a
step
up
in
every
category
brighter
color
better
head
crisper
and
more
complex
taste
and
with
a
little
hint
of
citrus
now
that
you
have
read
that
i
hijacked
that
from
a
review
for
steel
reserve
by
prototypic
this
beer
for
the
12
a
six
that
i
payed
really
is
no
more
impressive
nor
does
is
it
really
any
different
than
steel
reserve
it
tastes
almost
identical
to
a
malt
drink
i
had
once
at
a
friends
called
clear
creek
ice
or
for
that
matter
anything
that
comes
in
a
40
and
is
drank
from
a
paper
bag
drinkability
a
super
clean
and
drinkable
marzen
that
i
could
down
a
six
of
easily
a
classic
with
similar
tastes
to
their
other
brews
a
great
fall
beer
d
this
is
an
oktoberfest
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
in
the
summertime
alas
it
is
autumn
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
interesting
nonetheless
to
see
a
classic
german
brewers
unique
interpretation
of
a
classic
style
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
sweet
malty
a
bit
of
grain
good
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
a
punchy
lager
with
some
decent
flavours
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
d
easy
drinking
pretty
boring
marzen
though
so
many
better
options
d
not
a
bad
marzen
pretty
average
for
the
style
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
from
weihenstephaner
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
oktoberfest
d
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
marzen
style
lager
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
bat
an
eye
at
other
beers
the
abv
is
masked
well
but
hits
you
good
taste
was
to
me
akin
to
a
heineken
bit
of
hops
some
maltiness
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
this
just
doesnt
feel
like
an
ofest
very
refreshing
sensation
at
first
but
then
a
strong
bitterness
fills
all
your
mouth
and
also
in
the
back

to
justify
its

then
it
could
be
dubbed
a

as

oddly
aside
of
its
cohorts
but
you
can
feel
some
depth
in

nothing
noteworthy

the

the

scores
an

for

the
best
thing
to
say
is
buyer
beware
if
you
expect
a
helles
i
cant
say
im
enjoying
this
beer
generally
i
like
a
bit
of
flavor
with
my
beer
this
one
is
bitter
with
a
bland
finish
it
had
some
carbanation
which
sort
of
helped
and
it
had
a
pleasant
sour
wine
smell
the
drinkability
wasnt
high
in
my
opinion
drinkability
this
beer
is
eminently
sessionable
im
just
sad
im
not
drinking
a
maß
of
this
in
munich
d
a
5
here
being
withing
style
doent
really
count
on
this
one
having
said
that
this
beer
is
wonderful
with
a
5
8
abv
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
still
recommended
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
little
guys
in
short
order
d
this
is
kind
of
an
oddball
definitely
doesnt
fit
into
the
standard
ofest
definition
although
it
doesnt
actually
say
its
an
oktoberfest
anywhere
on
the
bottle
interesting
all
that
aside
a
pretty
decent
hoppy
german
lager
d
easy
to
drink
that
is
certain
however
some
might
not
like
the
sweet
flavor
in
this
beer
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
worth
a
try
once
d
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
its
just
ok
they
go
down
easy
but
theyre
very
light
for
the
style
there
are
much
better
oktoberfests
out
there
a
great
marzen
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
poured
golden
from
a
bottle
much
lighter
than
any
other
beer
ive
seen
labeled
festbier
had
a
sharp
hop
flavor
and
a
slightly
tart
taste
to
it
the
extra
abv
is
detectable
and
basically
what
sets
it
apart
from
a
pils
or
helles
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
except
that
it
is
so
much
lighter
and
sharper
any
of
the
other
marzens
ive
been
drinking
this
fall
poured
into
my
pint
glass
this
does
not
look
like
a
marzen
at
all
its
clear
golden
yellow
the
head
is
thick
and
pillowy
white
i
had
to
finish
pouring
twice
after
it
settles
plenty
of
white
lace
covers
the
glass
then
dissapears
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
grains
hops
and
wet
grass
it
sort
has
an
adjunct
air
about
it
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
sweet
grain
sweet
hops
bready
grassy
this
is
more
like
a
adjunct
then
a
marzen
medium
to
light
body
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
this
is
maybe
the
most
dissapointing
oktoberfest
experiance
to
date
it
was
more
pilsner
then
any
other
style
very
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
tall
short
lived
loose
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
with
slight
light
citrus
a
little
biscuit
malt
and
some
noble
hop
spice
lightly
sweet
and
bready
malt
backbone
with
some
lemon
zest
and
a
mildly
spicy
and
peppery
noble
hop
finish
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
i
suppose
i
might
not
be
fully
versed
in
proper
german
styles
but
this
does
not
seem
like
an
oktoberfest
at
all
its
a
nice
light
drinking
beer
more
like
a
kolsh
to
me
but
doesnt
have
the
hearty
malty
flavor
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
in
fall
slightly
watered
down
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
clove
spice
ripe
banana
citrus
fruit
and
bready
yeast
slightly
dry
finish
the
beer
pours
bright
and
yellow
with
a
healthy
amount
of
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
sweet
with
simple
but
fresh
malt
its
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
there
are
strong
grassy
hop
notes
the
malt
is
a
tad
sweet
but
its
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
marzen
and
this
beer
isnt
really
brewed
to
style
as
far
as
i
can
tell
but
i
find
this
beer
quite
good
its
simple
fresh
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
it
lacks
the
sharp
refreshing
bit
of
carbonation
that
i
look
for
in
a
beer
like
this
not
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
not
even
close
pours
brilliant
gold
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
falls
into
the
glass
does
not
look
like
the
amber
ofests
that
i
have
become
accustomed
to
looks
great
just
not
like
an
ofest
the
smell
is
sweet
bready
and
clean
spicy
hops
good
smell
just
not
as
malty
as
one
would
expect
from
the
style
taste
is
crisp
sweet
lager
not
the
fruitiness
and
malt
i
thought
it
would
be
good
just
not
the
style
see
the
trend
yet
mouthfeel
is
light
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
tastes
like
a
good
german
pils
to
me
i
like
it
alot
it
just
isnt
true
to
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
tight
pure
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
very
light
ring
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
euro
lager
a
bit
skunky
sulfer
grainy
and
grassy
nobel
hops
the
taste
seems
to
be
a
watered
down
version
of
the
aroma
less
skunky
and
grainy
taste
but
very
bland
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
munich
malt
flavors
or
the
slightly
bolder
oktoberfest
flavor
no
hints
of
caramel
or
toasted
munich
malt
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
plenty
of
fizzy
carbonation
nice
crisp
lager
this
is
a
very
disappointing
oktoberfest
from
a
great
german
brewery
totally
missed
the
mark
and
came
off
as
a
euro
lager
overall
quite
nice
really
glad
i
rereviewed
it
as
this
brewery
really
deserves
it
i
visited
them
a
couple
years
ago
and
really
loved
the
place
i
really
want
to
go
back
again
but
in
the
mean
time
i
can
enjoy
a
lot
more
of
these
beers
1158
partially
dry
but
with
sweet
undertone
is
that
possible
round
mouthfeel
with
a
neutral
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavor
has
some
sour
elements
that
peak
at
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
has
some
definitive
peppery
hop
this
is
a
superior
marzen
in
many
ways
im
ready
for
another
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
thats
good
enough
for
me
to
finish
the
6pack
i
bought
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
mfd
a
well
carbonated
brew
with
a
light
medium
body
the
carbonation
makes
the
beer
quite
filling
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
lends
itself
to
more
and
more
drinking
very
palatable
and
easily
enjoyed
on
the
hottest
of
summer
days
or
in
maßkrüge
at
the
fest
d
yes
please
id
like
some
more
thats
all
that
i
can
say
to
weihenstephaner
a
top
notch
brewery
this
does
not
taste
like
an
oktoberfest
beer
to
me
its
more
like
a
helles
had
this
on
tap
at
the
stable
in
st
louis
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
head
it
smelled
very
bready
and
the
taste
was
yeasty
with
a
slight
lemon
taste
as
well
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
helles
it
was
not
very
remarkable
but
not
bad
either
it
was
fairly
easy
drinking
but
seemed
to
be
filling
so
i
dont
think
it
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
an
alright
beer
but
not
the
stellar
ones
i
usually
expect
from
the
brewery
unfortunately
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
its
cleaned
up
by
the
end
theres
a
minimum
of
yeast
and
it
has
a
soft
velvety
mouthfeel
to
boot
not
my
ideal
quaffer
because
its
a
smidgeon
heavy
on
malt
but
at
5
8
its
a
decent
party
beer
bring
on
the
bratwürst
its
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easily
although
the
flavours
jangle
a
little
in
the
mouth
leaving
me
unsure
as
to
whether
they
really
fit
together
that
well
still
its
smooth
enough
and
presumably
easy
to
quaff
from
litre
steins
thats
what
were
really
after
right
a
500ml
bottle
poured
into
my
dimpled
mug
appears
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
apricot
color
with
a
full
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
lingering
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
floral
hops
caramel
medium
toasted
grain
a
touch
of
spiciness
a
bit
fruity
and
malty
about
a
notch
better
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
certainly
worth
a
try
for
any
marzen
fan
d
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
not
my
favorite
but
it
does
indeed
have
refreshing
qualities
notes
not
a
complex
beerbut
session
worthy
with
an
overall
agreeable
taste
not
bad
while
this
drank
nicely
and
offered
some
decent
enough
flavors
this
could
have
dialed
the
citrus
back
a
bit
and
offered
a
bit
more
presence
in
the
body
decent
but
not
one
of
the
best
märzens
that
ive
had
note
a
more
positive
rereview
is
forthcoming
im
impressed
with
festbier
its
good
stuff
nicely
done
all
around
i
really
disagree
with
the
style
classification
here
on
the
site
this
isnt
really
close
to
being
an
oktoberfest
i
dont
see
any
information
on
the
label
that
claims
such
a
title
so
im
not
penalizing
the
beer
for
being
a
poor
representation
recommended
d
this
is
a
little
disappointing
for
weihenstephaner
it
was
also
a
little
disappointing
for
a
marzenoktoberfest
felt
like
any
other
average
beer
nothing
overly
significant
but
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
d
like
mentioned
above
a
hair
less
body
than
your
typical
marzen
and
the
color
is
definitely
lighter
ill
definitely
have
this
again
as
its
more
sessionable
than
the
heavier
fest
biers
drinkability
a
little
out
of
place
here
in
february
but
i
could
see
this
as
a
suitable
barbecue
session
beer
conclusion
not
what
you
might
expect
for
the
style
but
oh
so
very
tasty
this
is
one
i
discovered
by
accident
buying
a
sixer
for
a
friends
22nd
birthday
but
i
will
definitely
revisit
it
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
many
others
are
foul
compared
to
this
smooth
drinking
brew
its
just
right
and
it
makes
me
want
to
speak
german
i
do
speak
german
do
yourself
a
favor
get
some
of
this
and
give
it
the
respect
you
give
your
elders
drinkability
very
drinkable
leaves
you
wanting
more
drinkability
this
was
a
bit
of
a
find
for
me
as
my
local
has
a
sixer
for
7
99
at
that
price
its
a
steal
the
weihenstephaner
bottles
claim
that
they
are
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
and
with
this
level
of
quality
its
totally
understandable
why
theyd
still
be
around
pretty
much
a
perfect
beer
with
which
to
relax
inside
when
theres
a
foot
of
snow
outside
drinkability
meh
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
even
though
the
abv
is
just
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
an
enjoyable
lager
drinkability
a
very
nice
light
lager
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
festbier
but
from
what
i
understand
this
is
the
direction
german
oktoberfest
biers
are
heading
in
could
definitely
imbibe
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
great
brew
d
are
you
joking
this
style
is
intended
to
be
quaffed
from
large
heavy
drinking
vessels
hoisted
while
singing
along
to
a
german
oompah
band
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
have
been
with
other
weihenstephaner
brews
but
its
still
outstandingly
drinkable
brew
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
but
sweeter
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
darker
and
maltier
beer
but
it
was
still
an
interesting
take
on
this
style
drinkability
very
good
this
beer
is
an
all
around
great
beer
too
bad
i
dont
really
consider
it
to
be
a
festbier
will
definitely
revisit
in
the
end
a
classic
little
brew
nothing
to
do
back
flips
over
but
more
then
decent
on
every
account
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
drinkability
while
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
would
expect
from
a
marzenoktoberfest
i
suppose
these
guys
are
the
ones
that
really
know
how
to
do
it
the
rich
flavor
is
more
in
keeping
with
what
i
am
used
to
caramel
malt
and
a
sweet
finish
like
it
not
much
to
this
one
celar
gold
pour
white
head
faint
aroma
of
grass
and
malt
light
spice
and
yeast
with
the
hops
to
make
it
even
lighter
tasting
i
expected
so
much
more
from
a
seasonal
especailly
and
oktoberfest
still
better
than
a
budweiser
though
not
by
much
md
not
a
very
drinkableenjoyable
beer
in
my
opinion
its
a
little
too
thin
and
overcarbonated
it
just
wasnt
an
appealing
drink
for
me
somewhat
hazy
in
the
body
a
deep
blonde
color
the
head
is
small
but
holds
up
solidly
musty
woodlike
aroma
with
some
maltiness
the
taste
spicy
hops
faint
medicinal
flavor
mild
matiness
honey
hmmm
a
little
lighter
and
coarse
than
i
was
expecting
overall
still
this
is
worth
a
try
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
except
for
the
fairly
high
alcohol
content
however
for
the
style
it
totally
misses
while
the
aroma
seems
right
the
taste
barely
has
the
marzen
kick
i
expected
hence
the
taste
ding
the
color
is
way
too
pale
but
the
mouth
feel
and
overall
drinkability
were
very
pleasant
while
not
representing
the
style
well
still
a
good
beer
d
its
average
slightly
opaque
in
color
for
an
oktoberfest
and
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
definitely
like
the
toasted
malts
though
do
the
taste
is
relatively
tame
and
onedimensional
which
leads
to
a
pretty
high
score
on
the
drinkability
scale
classifying
this
as
a
märzenoktoberfest
leads
me
to
review
it
against
the
style
which
i
think
this
beer
completely
misses
i
understand
this
is
a
newerbreed
of
lighter
oktoberfest
beers
but
its
certainly
not
a
märzen
lager
if
it
is
its
a
pretty
poor
attempt
by
such
a
good
brewery
if
this
was
brewed
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
over
the
course
of
the
day
then
its
a
successful
easydrinking
lager
that
does
what
it
was
intended
to
do
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
but
think
a
different
style
classification
is
in
order
here
straw
yellow
color
with
a
slight
haze
rich
and
creamy
aromas
mingle
with
some
citrusy
overtones
this
is
very
unique
and
attractive
rarely
do
you
mix
citrus
and
dairy
without
a
curdling
mess
but
it
really
works
for
this
beer
because
it
is
so
subtle
and
refined
body
is
light
yet
has
a
rich
and
satisfying
character
that
could
get
dangerous
i
could
easily
pour
this
down
the
hatch
while
riding
my
german
lawnmower
down
the
autobahn
pours
a
white
head
on
top
of
a
straw
colored
body
the
smell
is
classic
german
helles
pilsner
corn
smell
i
always
associate
this
particular
malt
with
tase
is
pretty
standard
to
a
festbier
a
slightly
different
malt
is
used
then
normal
to
give
the
festbier
a
distinct
flavor
i
think
it
taste
a
little
more
corm
like
and
a
little
more
bitter
that
the
usual
helles
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
slick
at
the
end
drinkability
is
good
hard
to
find
something
to
complain
about
a
good
beer
like
this
flavor
tas
spicy
and
a
bit
spicy
and
tangy
with
some
biscuit
underneath
mouthfeel
was
good
to
make
this
an
extremely
drinkable
fest
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
get
back
to
me
if
you
know
whats
up
with
the
nuns
d
i
hate
to
pan
a
beer
from
a
brewery
as
great
as
weihenstephaner
but
i
have
to
do
it
i
am
no
purist
so
its
not
that
i
didnt
like
this
beer
because
it
broke
some
silly
rules
its
just
that
this
beer
was
not
terribly
enjoyable

d
this
is
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
cant
get
much
more
drinkable
that
that
poured
rather
pale
lemon
tending
orange
colour
with
a
reasonable
snow
white
head
that
dissapates
rather
quickly
aromas
are
dominated
by
sweet
fruit
mainly
citrus
with
some
grainy
malt
coming
into
play
also
palate
shows
more
of
the
same
with
the
grainy
malt
adding
an
almost
flinty
character
imo
rather
light
palate
is
served
well
by
the
dry
finish
that
perhaps
lacks
penetration
due
to
the
extremely
low
bitterness
which
i
suppose
the
style
requires
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
oktoberfest
brew
its
really
drinkable
not
much
in
the
mouthfeel
but
very
drinkable
id
buy
it
again
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
not
much
of
a
marzen
without
the
caramel
malt
quality
nor
a
warming
sensation
that
the
style
usually
showcases
the
staleness
in
the
grain
does
not
help
either
hopefully
this
brew
is
much
better
ontap
in
germany
because
this
does
not
stand
up
to
any
other
offering
from
weihenstephaner
this
is
typical
of
a
munich
marzen
style
beer
light
in
color
with
a
modest
to
slight
head
subtle
aroma
of
malts
and
a
clean
crisp
dry
taste
unlike
the
american
marzens
that
have
risen
in
popularity
this
one
lacks
any
sign
of
sweetness
but
sports
a
clean
carbonated
finish
with
a
slight
hop
a
the
end
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
earlier
days
of
oktoberfest
season
but
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
the
days
of
waning
daylight
pretty
good
tasty
and
very
drinkable
ive
had
better
oktoberfests
and
i
usually
expect
much
better
from
this
brewery
its
still
a
solid
beer
but
im
slightly
disappointed
weihenstephans
oktoberfest
pours
a
much
paler
color
that
most
other
oktoberfests
it
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
white
cap
the
aroma
consists
of
fresh
baked
bread
theres
almost
a
pretzellike
quality
to
it
the
hops
are
lemony
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
fullbodied
theres
a
bready
maltiness
to
it
upfront
hops
appear
grassy
and
add
some
balance
to
the
malt
sweetness
they
linger
into
the
finish
and
add
a
small
bit
of
lemony
tartness
to
the
flavor
its
a
little
different
than
your
average
oktobefests
in
color
and
flavor
but
its
still
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
drinker
its
drinkable
but
not
very
i
am
not
impressed
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
it
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
i
question
the
ability
of
this
being
sold
as
a
marzen
not
to
be
crude
but
this
is
almost
what
i
urinate
after
a
night
of
drinking
real
marzens
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
toasted
straw
and
grain
aroma
with
saaz
hop
spiciness
munich
maltiness
some
nice
moderate
sweetness
with
a
citruslemongrass
hoppiness
that
provides
balance
mouthfeel
is
great
carbonation
is
soft
but
adequate
body
is
mediumthin
but
fullflavored
drinkability
is
excellent
d
very
very
drinkable
has
just
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
more
without
any
overpowering
characteristics
the
pale
oktoberfests
are
new
to
me
but
im
not
disappointed
so
far
d
yeah
especially
if
you
dont
want
to
be
bogged
down
with
the
heaviness
some
ofest
beers
present
smooth
not
overly
sweet
just
too
light
for
my
preference
picked
up
a
single
in
a
mixed
6er
from
liberty
st
tavern
pours
a
clear
gold
like
an
export
lager
in
fact
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
this
beer
is
more
like
a
dortmunderexport
lager
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
a
sweet
bready
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
smooth
caramel
theres
also
a
mild
spicy
hop
note
at
the
end
of
the
beer
its
drinkable
like
a
typical
ofest
and
similarly
hoppe
but
the
malt
profile
is
lighter
pours
a
clear
surprisingly
pale
yellow
color
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
lacing
in
my
pilsn
glass
huh
smells
like
a
pilsner
w
more
emphasis
on
malts
some
grassy
hop
aroma
as
well
tastes
like
a
pilsner
too
thought
is
was
mislabled
till
i
got
on
checked
steely
grain
and
some
noble
hop
flavors
more
hop
bite
than
other
ger
fests
dry
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
if
it
was
a
pils
or
helles
it
would
be
excellent
but
imo
this
is
not
a
fest
at
all
d
drinkable
to
a
fault
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
paired
so
perfectly
with
the
food
and
generally
disappeared
in
gulps
rather
than
sips
eliciting
a
where
did
it
go
response
when
i
looked
down
at
a
half
sausage
and
an
empty
glass
im
puzzled
by
the
style
and
intrigued
this
didnt
seem
like
a
märzenoktoberfest
like
im
used
to
could
have
been
a
doughy
kellerbier
or
helles
instead
though
im
still
learning
these
styles
and
their
subtleties
no
matter
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
definitely
have
one
again
nice
body
clean
finish
like
chucky
weihenstephaner
festbier
poured
a
light
and
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
smell
was
good
flowers
and
mildly
spicy
hops
taste
was
mild
all
around
some
sweetness
in
the
front
followed
by
hit
of
hop
spice
mouthfell
was
good
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
festbier
easy
to
drink
and
offers
some
nice
flavors
i
would
drink
this
again
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
copper
color
with
a
richer
sweeter
malt
character
but
such
was
not
the
case
here
this
reminded
me
very
much
of
hofbraus
oktoberfest
which
can
be
hit
or
miss
itself
drinkability
is
pretty
high
none
of
the
munich
malt
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
the
sucker
is
made
to
drink
by
the
liter
and
id
probably
be
able
to
do
so
and
for
the
modern
style
its
one
of
the
better
examples
still
im
just
not
a
modern
guy
and
would
prefer
a
maltier
brew
rather
then
then
the
fraternity
party
deluxe
the
smell
was
somewhat
fruity
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
was
malty
that
hung
on
the
tongue
and
seemed
pretty
sticky
in
the
mouth
as
the
festbier
gets
warmer
it
gets
sweeter
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
marzen
pours
a
yellow
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
and
a
light
sheeting
of
lace
on
the
glass
herbal
aroma
with
a
touch
of
mint
taste
is
is
same
very
clean
with
no
after
taste
mouthfeel
medium
and
good
carbonation
nice
taste
to
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
body
to
it
this
is
the
first
weihenstephaner
i
have
not
enjoyed
much
drinkability
incredilbly
clean
smooth
easygoing
and
drinkable
this
one
would
be
a
very
earlyoktoberfest
festbier
it
seems
more
suited
for
summer
than
anything
not
necessarily
one
id
get
again
though
while
it
is
light
and
fresh
and
whatnot
its
just
not
terribly
interesting
guess
ive
been
officially
spoiled
by
american
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
light
with
a
nice
clean
taste
and
finish
the
beer
was
very
refreshing
also
it
was
a
very
light
blond
color
the
head
did
not
last
at
all
and
the
beer
only
had
fair
lacing
qualities
i
would
buy
again
mouth
feel
is
clean
slightly
tingly
a
very
good
beer
for
session
drinking
hard
to
find
another
does
anyone
have
a
large
tent
and
a
band
available
nice
drinkability
which
is
what
one
expects
out
of
a
festbier
a
good
balance
makes
it
drinkable
and
a
sweet
finish
lends
the
pallet
to
want
another
sip
this
beer
is
a
unique
and
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
that
is
worth
a
try
very
different
from
the
other
oktoberfest
beers
sampled
thus
far
lighter
in
malt
character
as
well
as
color
making
it
much
more
akin
to
a
helles
but
this
is
simply
a
festbier
after
all
with
a
tingly
pineherb
flavour
and
bitterness
and
the
guy
sitting
next
to
me
did
as
well
when
i
asked
him
his
recommendation
for
the
style
but
not
by
much
finishes
by
leaving
the
faintest
lightly
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
as
well
as
the
addition
of
some
light
fruit
pear
wheatbiscuity
character
lingers
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
consistent
yeast
drinkability
sure
its
an
ok
german
beer
a
true
octoberfest
marzen
well
its
a
good
season
to
be
in
theres
more
to
try
poured
from
the
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
slightly
opaque
golden
color
topped
by
a
small
light
white
head
aroma
of
lightly
fruity
pale
malt
along
with
a
touch
of
adjunct
flavor
palate
is
mildly
sweet
up
front
before
yielding
to
a
husky
bitterness
before
the
swallow
the
sweetness
returns
on
the
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
body
is
a
little
thin
but
also
slightly
creamy
and
holds
the
flavor
well
enough
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
by
any
means
but
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
not
particularly
creamy
definitely
not
crisp
there
is
a
champagne
type
apple
flavor
some
vinous
notes
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
hop
presence
with
a
touch
of
pepper
spice
on
the
back
end
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
a
bready
quality
but
the
breezy
champagne
lightness
the
strong
apple
notes
and
the
simple
smoothness
to
the
beer
predominate
over
everything
else
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
dont
know
how
this
is
a
marzan
by
an
stretch
d
very
drinkable
my
complaint
is
the
color
this
would
be
much
higher
ranked
if
the
color
was
different
that
being
said
this
makes
an
amazing
session
beer
this
is
a
great
helles
but
a
rather
poor
oktoberfest
still
worth
a
try
as
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
d
a
good
early
autumn
beer
easy
to
drink
and
worth
having
a
couple
of
on
a
sunny
afternoon
it
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
though
not
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
that
ive
ever
had
would
be
happy
to
drink
with
bratwurst
in
the
fall
great
beer
in
the
sun
with
a
lot
of
meat
on
the
bone
sneaky
fast
the
appearance
struck
me
by
surprise
since
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
i
should
have
known
it
was
way
to
early
in
the
season
after
study
more
on
this
beer
it
was
no
surprise
that
it
is
an
octoberfest
style
what
trick
me
was
the
christmas
looking
wreaths
and
bulbs
on
the
label
it
appears
in
a
light
golden
haze
im
drinking
it
in
the
ultimate
beer
glass
by
samuel
adams
the
head
was
holding
its
own
very
stable
and
then
withers
away
after
around
four
sips
the
smell
had
some
spicy
notes
with
hops
dangling
around
the
nose
after
the
initial
pour
the
tast
resembles
a
marzen
the
most
because
i
dont
taste
the
malty
notes
that
are
more
apparent
in
an
octoberfest
the
alcohol
is
present
here
dissapating
very
quickly
and
smooth
over
the
tongue
leaving
very
quick
nice
you
might
say
the
drinkability
doesnt
have
my
belly
full
that
quick
like
fuller
bodied
beers
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
easily
considering
the
alcohol
content
as
well
d
a
very
nice
marzen
if
you
get
past
the
fact
that
its
not
dark
it
is
an
excellent
beer
very
light
colored
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
in
my
opinion
there
are
some
very
light
and
subtle
aromas
of
a
mild
citric
character
and
light
hop
bitterness
some
mild
spices
up
front
on
the
tongue
that
lead
off
to
a
solid
malt
sweetness
across
the
palate
mild
hop
burn
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
here
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
session
beer
with
a
light
body
mild
flavors
and
decent
carbonation
perfect
beer
for
a
muggy
autumn
day
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
more
full
and
rich
considering
the
style
as
with
many
other
bas
i
was
surprised
at
the
unusually
straw
colored
beer
where
most
oktoberfest
beers
begin
with
a
bright
copperorange
hue
mixed
in
with
ligher
highlights
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
german
lagers
even
the
nose
is
more
hopforward
with
a
spicy
saaz
note
and
haullertau
herbal
grassy
character
malts
stay
clean
crisp
sweet
and
bold
with
no
hints
of
caramel
toast
or
melanoidin
taste
instead
a
bold
lagerlike
flavor
comes
through
though
pushing
the
threshold
on
sweetness
and
body
confectionate
sugars
with
fresh
fruity
notes
pezlike
give
a
very
pleasant
sweet
tastes
to
accompany
the
pilsner
malts
a
bit
heavy
in
the
body
for
a
pils
begins
to
bring
out
a
marzentype
weight
nicely
carbonated
and
bitter
finishes
quite
clean
with
a
hop
note
late
and
some
malty
sweet
breadiness
yeastiness
its
a
very
good
beer
but
not
what
i
consider
a
festbier
so
the
rating
may
not
reflect
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
style
accuracy
when
i
first
tried
this
i
didnt
really
like
it
very
much
but
i
tried
it
again
and
its
actually
quite
tasty
definitely
not
as
good
as
other
ofests
but
good
t
m
d
toasty
malts
rounded
with
a
full
hop
flavour
a
bit
herbal
a
bit
grassy
and
with
a
dash
of
bitterness
medium
body
a
lighter
carbonation
zing
and
a
touch
of
oiliness
going
down
insanely
drinkable
it
presents
and
drinks
like
a
lighter
lager
perhaps
not
quite
what
id
go
for
in
the
style
but
a
tasty
brew
nonetheless
poured
from
a
large
weihenstephaner
bottle
not
the
12oz
six
pack
bottles
the
beer
is
very
clear
light
yellow
colored
with
good
sized
white
foam
leaving
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
bready
with
some
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
likewise
malty
sweet
with
some
complementary
floral
hops
notes
it
smells
and
tastes
more
like
a
munich
helles
than
a
marzen
but
weihenstephaner
knows
what
theyre
doing
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
after
all
the
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
could
hardly
be
improved
weihenstephaner
is
a
solid
choice
no
matter
which
style
they
make
d
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
but
it
is
easy
drinking
you
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
a
good
fest
brew
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
with
more
body
and
character
though
this
one
is
really
drinkable
d
this
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
it
might
just
be
the
style
but
the
taste
didnt
have
enough
complexity
or
interest
to
it
d
drinkability
is
decent
while
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
6
0
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
dont
understand
how
its
considered
a
marzen
was
expecting
more
from
this
i
guess
considering
their
other
styles
are
pretty
much
tops
in
class
exquisitely
brewed
quite
possible
the
perfect
summer
beer
it
may
not
be
xtreme
enough
to
get
the
kind
of
mad
props
it
deserves
from
beer
snobs
but
if
youre
looking
for
art
in
a
glass
you
could
hardly
do
better
than
to
pick
up
some
festbier
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
fairly
refreshing
drinkable
just
totally
not
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
is
definitely
by
the
liter
forget
the
caramel
sticky
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
nutty
edge
octoberfest
beer
that
we
drink
this
is
the
type
of
beer
meant
to
be
drank
in
number
during
times
of
celebration
so
enjoy
and
swing
your
elbow
back
and
forth
prost
a
cloudy
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
relatively
no
head
virtually
no
smell
except
for
a
slight
light
fruitsweet
smell
this
is
a
bit
different
than
most
oktoberfests
that
ive
had
sweet
malt
but
not
enough
bready
vienna
toffee
maltiness
that
i
love
but
matched
with
a
bitter
hop
profile
this
isnt
the
best
of
its
style

lighter

late
not
what
i
expected
in
a
german
ofest
style
beer
but
this
one
is
highly
quaff
able
and
quite
enjoyable
whatever
style
it
actually
fits
into
gave
it
a
shot
as
part
of
a
chicken
marinade
to
boot
superbly
rounded
and
balanced
remarkably
drinkable
a
definite
must
taste
for
anyone
interested
in
the
maerzen
style
lighter
and
less
malty
than
most
marzens
but
its
unique
take
is
definitely
welcome
to
the
style
light
smooth
and
goes
down
well
which
an
oktoberfest
beer
should
not
bad
at
all
though
not
quite
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
festbier
palate
is
saazlike
hops
up
front
followed
by
subdued
maltiness
overall
dry
and
crips
refreshing
but
certainly
not
a
malty
festbier
that
i
was
expecting
weihenstephaner
sets
a
very
high
standard
for
itself
and
this
in
my
opinion
falls
somewhat
short
of
their
usual
excellence
still
a
clearly
good
and
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
although
i
would
usually
choose
their
helles
over
this
come
september
i
can
see
myself
buying
at
least
a
4pack
of
this
beer
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
initially
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
is
grassy
malty
and
perfumed
with
euro
hops
taste
is
balanced
hints
of
lemon
in
the
malt
and
nicely
hopped
upon
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
no
special
characteristics
across
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
quite
refreshing
it
is
bordering
on
the
edge
of
sessionability
but
one
could
consume
several
of
these
without
being
overwhelmed
style
wise
this
strikes
me
more
as
a
pils
this
is
worthy
of
a
try
just
a
tiny
bit
thin
to
be
a
really
strong
lager
the
hops
take
away
from
the
chewiness
definitely
drinkable
a
tasty
beer
not
one
ill
go
back
to
but
i
had
to
round
out
the
weihenstephaner
lineup
hugely
drinkable
for
a
lighter
style
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
sensible
alcohol
content
this
is
a
great
pick
would
be
just
as
good
a
summer
beer
as
an
oktoberfest
thing
id
definitely
pick
it
up
again
drinkability
didnt
want
to
finish
this
beer
just
wanted
to
find
something
else
that
i
wanted
to
drink
i
might
give
it
a
try
again
if
i
can
find
something
that
i
can
ensure
is
100
fresh
and
not
take
a
risk
on
a
bottle
without
a
date
again
i
would
have
another
if
available
but
not
as
a
session
12
oz
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
back
label
the
beer
is
gold
with
low
carbonation
two
inches
of
creamy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
along
with
some
coagulationfloaties
fairly
sweet
and
lightly
grainy
in
the
nose
similar
in
flavor
with
a
dose
of
mildly
bitter
spicygrassy
hops
on
top
of
an
almost
tingly
light
dry
body
that
has
medium
carbonation
and
finish
pretty
tasty
and
quite
clean
but
it
almost
tastes
more
like
a
german
pils
than
a
märzen
i
had
not
seen
this
beer
before
in
ny
so
being
in
the
sunny
state
of
florida
i
figured
i
would
try
this
offering
nice
pour
from
the
bottle
typical
yeasty
haze
with
a
nice
foamy
heard
had
that
banna
clove
taste
and
smell
but
with
definetely
more
sweetness
upfront
also
this
beer
did
not
seem
to
go
down
as
quickly
a
little
heavier
spicey
and
clove
like
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
prefer
their
old
standard
brew
a
1
pint
09
fl
oz
bottle
copped
in
short
hills
pours
a
clear
lucid
pale
color
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
soon
receded
smell
was
typical
of
the
style
with
a
nice
combination
of
malts
and
hops
taste
wasnt
bad
but
was
somewhat
bland
with
a
slight
mixture
of
caramel
vanilla
and
fresh
florals
mouthfeel
was
about
average
and
the
points
took
a
hit
here
due
to
the
somewhat
watereddown
mouthfeel
that
was
thin
and
wasnt
too
rich
or
creamy
drinkability
was
decent
due
to
the
modest
abv
and
the
light
refreshing
crisp
taste
that
would
go
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
definitely
not
a
wintertime
brew
weihenstephaners
hefeweizen
is
a
much
better
selection
overall
not
a
horrible
brew
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
tasty
easy
drinking
this
would
make
a
good
hot
weather
beer
light
carbonated
head
pretty
good
fruity
and
hoppy
smell
hoppy
bitter
flavor
that
gets
worse
on
the
second
sip
actually
starts
to
taste
a
little
like
cough
syrup
definitely
overwhelming
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
excessively
complicated
and
way
to
bitter
this
one
still
needs
a
lot
of
work
this
was
not
an
outstanding
beer
in
any
category
but
was
well
crafted
when
all
aspects
are
combined
i
was
surprised
by
the
bitterness
at
the
end
but
it
married
well
with
the
slight
spiciness
malt
and
yeast
throughout
sampled
at
the
odds
and
ends
tasting
ii
on
101907
this
beer
is
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
burns
off
quickly
spotty
lacing
sweet
malt
and
fruit
in
the
nose
and
a
touch
skunky
lightbodied
with
a
fruity
character
along
with
light
grain
and
hops
flavors
the
finish
is
short
and
leaves
a
bready
malt
aftertaste
soso
overall
drinkability
easy
drinker
thought
this
was
a
winter
beer
from
the
fest
part
of
the
label
but
i
guess
it
was
a
holdover
from
the
fall
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
its
perfectly
drinkable
drinkability
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
for
weihenstephaner
so
far
but
at
least
its
a
decent
light
offer
from
them
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
beer
again
but
if
i
saw
this
next
to
their
other
offerings
i
would
go
for
the
other
ones
instead
notes
quite
good
but
not
as
noteworthy
as
some
of
the
other
beers
from
this
excellent
brewery
an
enjoyable
lager
nonetheless
though
one
that
i
feel
would
be
more
suited
as
a
summer
beer
overall
a
very
well
balanced
beer
which
is
full
of
suprises
extremely
drinkable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
those
overly
sweet
oktoberfest
offerings
quite
drinkable
but
only
for
those
who
like
a
strong
hoppy
pilsner
despite
what
the
style
says
this
is
really
a
strong
and
balls
to
the
wall
pilsner
a
beer
i
can
recommend
for
the
lager
hophead
drinkability

this
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
like
the
weizen
offerings
from
weihenstephaner
but
it
is
a
solid
festbier
overallthis
beer
is
excellent
but
i
had
to
downgrade
considerably
as
it
does
not
meet
style
outside
of
the
style
i
would
have
given
this
beer
4
0
across
the
board
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
this
is
a
good
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
im
very
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
adherence
to
the
style
i
respect
this
brewer
a
great
deal
but
i
dont
understand
how
you
can
call
this
an
oktoberfest
with
the
characteristics
that
this
beer
has
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
just
not
even
close
to
being
an
ofest
its
november
8th
today
and
there
was
a
sale
on
this
oktoberfest
beer
so
im
not
so
sure
how
fair
this
review
will
be
but
the
color
of
the
beer
was
what
is
expected
of
a
marzen
maybe
a
little
lighter
nice
foamy
white
head
accompanied
by
lasting
lacing
as
i
drink
it
down
i
smell
the
same
smell
that
ive
smelled
for
many
of
the
german
oktoberfest
beers
sweet
malt
touch
of
hops
some
yeasty
breadlike
qualities
and
so
on
chewy
and
sweet
and
tasty
the
right
carbonation
and
the
right
flavor
good
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
as
is
normal
in
the
style
yet
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
prosit
mk
d
very
drinkable
and
crisp
wish
it
were
easier
to
get
here
in
charleston
ok
i
dont
get
this
beer
i
was
told
this
is
one
of
the
original
oktoberfests
but
in
this
case
original
doesnt
mean
good
this
seems
like
maybe
a
pilsener
or
a
euro
lager
i
dont
know
but
those
arent
styles
i
enjoy
and
oktoberfests
usually
are
i
wont
be
coming
back
for
more
for
a
festbier
it
sure
does
seem
light
in
color
not
that
its
inherently
bad
just
different
and
to
be
honest
for
these
octoberfestthemed
fest
beers
i
really
like
that
burnt
orange
color
a
lot
more
the
aroma
is
very
close
to
a
light
lager
very
pale
maltish
alcohol
and
a
corn
type
smell
the
taste
is
also
very
similar
to
a
light
lager
but
there
is
something
extra
in
there
something
trying
to
give
it
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
between
the
alcoholpale
malt
sharpness
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
metallic
aftertaste
as
a
light
lager
and
nothing
else
this
isnt
bad
as
a
seasonal
beer
somewhat
aligned
with
the
oktoberfest
tradition
it
is
not
all
that
great
and
there
are
many
other
seasonals
out
there
i
would
rather
drink
over
this
spaten
hackerpschorr
etc
d
definitely
a
session
beer
in
that
festbier
is
extremely
drinkable
one
or
two
or
three
are
simply
not
enough
so
drinkable
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
have
at
a
party
of
massmarketedbeer
drinkers
this
beer
could
turn
any
beer
drinker
into
someone
appreciative
of
über
high
quality
this
poured
to
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
a
mix
of
grassy
hops
and
slight
skunky
grain
mouthfeel
from
this
somewhat
carbonated
beer
is
slightly
tingly
but
this
moves
right
into
a
flavor
of
grass
and
grain
finish
is
short
stale
and
a
littel
skunky
not
one
of
weihenstephaners
best
by
any
means
other
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
expected
more
this
beer
seems
almost
too
weak
and
lacking
i
could
certainly
see
why
chugging
mugs
of
this
beer
at
an
oktoberfest
celebration
would
be
easy
but
thats
not
what
i
was
looking
for
this
beer
is
not
what
i
had
expected
i
would
consider
this
an
excellent
czech
style
pilsner
overall
the
flavor
is
light
and
balanced
but
leans
toward
the
mild
citrus
hop
definitely
drinkable
however
it
lacks
the
toasted
malt
character
i
had
expected
for
a
marzen
great
drinkability
this
may
be
my
new
go
to
oktoberfest
definitely
the
best
of
what
i
have
had
this
season
aside
from
not
being
a
festbier
this
is
one
tasty
helles
augustiner
bräu
edelstoff
might
be
my
favorite
helles
ettaler
is
very
good
too
this
beer
is
nearly
on
that
level
this
beer
should
please
every
beer
drinker
aside
from
the
it
must
be
an
imperial
ipastoutwitbocketc
for
it
to
be
good
crowd
dont
you
just
hate
those
folks
i
do
if
youre
not
one
of
them
try
weihenstephaner
festbier
just
remember
it
is
a
helles
i
purchased
a
sixpack
in
council
bluffs
ia
i
found
this
one
a
little
bit
boring
i
probably
would
have
preferred
a
regular
allmalt
lager
or
vienna
lager
or
something
it
may
be
a
festbier
but
its
not
one
i
would
seek
not
recommended
d
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
for
its
slightly
higher
abv
blend
of
hops
and
malts
and
honey
in
the
taste
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
its
a
very
mellow
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
d
this
is
a
very
nice
festbier
along
the
lines
of
a
german
pilsner
its
very
tasty
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephan
i
disagree
with
the
marzen
classification
as
far
as
the
color
goes
ill
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
967yearold
bavarian
brewery
so
it
isnt
copper
like
all
the
other
fests
i
could
still
see
myself
partying
with
a
few
of
these
drinkability
this
is
certainly
not
a
marzen
and
it
is
not
very
good
not
even
as
a
euro
lager
overall
i
like
it
this
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
us
craft
oktoberfest
beers
and
a
bit
different
then
your
1516
purity
law
offerings
very
good
pale
yellow
with
average
nose
pleasant
sweet
taste
with
what
appears
to
be
honey
aftertaste
also
of
honey
good
stuff
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
recommend
to
anybody
a
bit
pricey
so
i
will
be
buying
six
packs
of
this
not
cases
good
job
by
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
ok
so
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
sixers
of
different
oktoberfest
beers
last
week
at
my
local
bevmo
this
being
one
of
them
weihenstephaner
being
a
respected
brewer
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
shot
pours
a
pale
gold
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
marzen
right
smells
clean
and
malty
tastes
honey
sweet
i
am
a
bit
dissapointed
with
the
lack
of
carameltoffee
sweetness
that
usually
comes
with
this
style
not
much
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
smooth
and
clean
malty
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
oktoberfestmarzen
pours
a
beautiful
crystalclear
golden
hue
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
bubbles
racing
to
the
service
the
head
was
quite
short
but
had
nice
staying
power
a
very
inviting
looking
brew
looks
more
like
a
pilsner
than
my
image
of
a
marzen
but
still
appealing
visually
the
smell
however
was
quite
skunky
up
front
with
some
faint
malt
and
spice
sweetness
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
was
very
sweet
up
front
lots
of
sugary
honeylike
malts
with
the
slightest
bite
at
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
balance
here
a
good
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
would
make
this
a
heck
of
a
refresher
if
the
beer
wasnt
so
sweet
average
drinkability
easy
to
handle
but
a
little
too
off
balance
to
crave
this
in
multiples
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
being
such
a
light
beer
it
has
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
the
hops
were
such
a
big
part
of
the
aroma
but
ended
up
taking
such
a
passive
role
in
the
overall
presentation
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
but
it
is
hard
to
go
wrong
with
anything
from
weihenstephan
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
its
very
tasty
and
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
but
doesnt
come
across
as
an
oktoberfest
style
beer
i
think
that
hackerpschorr
oktoberfestmärzen
is
a
much
better
german
import
example
of
this
style
this
is
a
helles
lager
with
a
touch
more
alcohol
a
fair
one
at
that
oddly
i
enjoyed
other
offerings
of
this
brewery
much
more
including
the
great
lager
that
they
make
this
one
seems
like
a
mediocreish
lager
with
a
touch
more
alcohol
as
an
ofest
its
passable
but
pretty
lame
drinkability
this
is
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
im
sure
with
others
its
probably
been
the
same
paid
around
13
for
the
6pack
and
though
im
glad
i
tried
it
id
probably
stick
to
the
weihenstephaner
hefe
varieties
in
the
future
drinkability
is
very
good
in
the
way
a
good
pils
is
no
offending
traits
overall
make
it
easily
quaffable
and
maybe
thats
where
the
fest
label
comes
from
itd
be
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
these
it
was
an
easy
to
drink
beer
just
not
something
that
id
go
back
to
i
prefer
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
recommended
obviously
the
helleslike
appearance
will
freak
out
those
that
have
never
seen
a
paler
version
stateside
and
many
of
them
are
more
accustomed
to
ofests
that
could
pass
for
bocks
or
doppelbocks
with
their
maltiness
this
is
all
about
finesse
and
actually
tradition
and
not
just
because
a
person
could
drink
a
bathtub
of
this
so
i
recommend
it
this
is
truly
a
very
unique
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
of
the
year
poured
1
12
bottles
into
a
hofbrau
500
ml
dimpled
mug
white
head
yellow
body
could
pass
for
any
of
those
pictures
from
oktoberfest
except
the
head
dissipates
quickly
unbelievably
drinkable
and
malty
though
its
so
yellow
a
quarter
inch
head
follows
the
brew
down
the
glass
lightly
hopped
and
a
great
gateway
beer
for
your
bmc
buddies
marienplatz
here
we
come
again
steve
not
bad
but
not
a
marzen
either
this
is
a
helles
lager
or
a
pils
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
pils
color
with
a
medium
size
head
that
fades
to
a
covering
there
is
some
light
lacing
actually
has
a
mild
hops
grassy
smell
which
is
an
improvement
over
bmc
type
beers
taste
is
not
a
whole
lot
better
than
bmc
lagers
definitely
a
bit
of
corn
here
the
mouthfeel
puts
it
in
front
of
bmc
products
light
and
crisp
but
not
at
all
watery
or
thin
just
right
for
a
light
style
drinkability
is
good
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
session
beer
i
doubt
i
would
choose
it
over
yeungling
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
better
than
bmc
lagers
all
in
all
fairly
average
nice
summer
drinker
but
not
what
i
expect
for
a
marzen
overall
not
the
best
offering
by
weihenstephaner
its
an
okay
brew
but
i
expected
so
much
more
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
medium
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
but
leaves
some
good
lacing
pale
for
the
style
this
one
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
fest
beer
all
around
and
less
malty
than
most
but
at
this
point
in
the
late
summer
its
a
nice
bridge
beer
from
the
weiss
beers
to
the
maltier
fest
beers
smell
is
slightly
grainy
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
clean
malt
banana
and
apple
as
well
taste
is
also
cleanlight
and
slightly
grainy
apple
flavors
are
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
a
trace
of
banana
in
the
aftertaste
interesting
and
refreshing
but
ill
want
more
as
the
autumn
comes
subtlety
is
the
key
here
its
not
an
extreme
us
craft
oktoberfest
so
lets
not
get
our
hopes
up
too
much
folks
d
ive
had
better
marzens
in
the
past
this
one
was
all
right
but
probably
wont
buy
again
even
though
i
had
no
problems
drinking
it
danka
weihenstephaners
i
love
a
good
festbier
and
this
is
a
quality
example
of
the
style
done
right
enjoy
these
while
you
can
a
good
beer
if
nothing
special
i
think
weihenstephan
should
probably
stick
to
wheat
beers
where
they
truly
excel
iam
reviewing
this
beer
for
what
it
is
because
it
is
not
a
marzenoktoberfest
style
of
beer
if
i
reviewed
to
that
style
well
it
wouldnt
work
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
clear
medium
golden
with
a
tight
formed
creamylike
white
head
that
left
a
broken
ring
of
lace
behind
pretty
clean
aromas
a
bit
of
toastiness
and
iron
a
decent
spicey
hop
smack
that
lingers
to
me
this
is
a
full
flavord
and
bodied
pilsner
toasty
malt
with
a
bit
of
residual
honey
sweetness
almost
to
the
doughy
point
but
not
quite
a
leafyherbal
hop
profile
in
the
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
why
such
a
renowned
brewery
would
label
it
a
fest
well
i
have
no
idea
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
decent
good
beer
could
certainly
be
enjoyed
at
a
fest
in
october
february
or
july
but
the
style
is
wrong
crisp
and
light
bodied
but
seems
too
soft
like
a
czech
pils
needs
to
be
a
little
more
sharp
and
aggressively
malty
decent
hops
bitterness
on
the
other
hand
not
too
bad
but
it
was
worth
a
try
enough
to
get
me
excited
for
the
upcoming
oktoberfest
season
pours
ultra
clear
light
golden
color
head
of
bone
white
bubbles
crisp
grassy
hop
aroma
with
a
touch
of
malt
taste
is
well
balanced
but
light
on
both
malt
and
hops
little
bitter
bite
at
the
finish
very
ordinary
line
this
up
with
some
american
macro
lagers
and
it
would
fit
right
in
pass
d
quite
a
refreshing
simple
beer
would
serve
its
purpose
at
oktoberfest
well
on
any
summer
session
occasion
but
for
regular
drinking
theres
much
tastier
beers
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
overall
a
lackluster
beer
for
sure
this
is
a
good
primer
prebeer
beer
pound
a
pint
of
this
then
move
on
up
to
something
a
little
better
poured
into
a
weizen
and
noticed
a
rapidly
dissipating
head
but
long
lacing
colour
is
translucent
hazy
strawamber
i
got
a
mild
grainy
aroma
but
not
very
strong
or
persistent
tast
was
big
and
malty
with
some
grassiness
to
give
it
an
edge
and
some
late
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
other
reviewers
rated
this
down
but
i
really
love
it
and
if
it
were
more
available
it
would
be
my
session
beer
even
above
my
beloved
little
critters
i
expect
better
from
this
brewery
maybe
it
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
overall
a
good
but
largely
unremarkable
brew
certainly
worth
a
try
but
hardly
at
the
pinnacle
of
style
pleasant
and
refreshing
not
as
crisp
as
pilseners
more
like
northern
lager
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
forming
that
retains
very
well
by
the
color
i
am
wondering
if
this
is
a
fest
beer
or
a
helles
or
even
a
pilsner
light
floral
fragrance
mostly
bread
and
biscuit
aroma
is
most
prevelent
the
taste
is
mild
bringing
those
bread
and
biscuit
scents
in
flavor
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
at
the
end
it
has
a
thin
consistancy
there
fore
the
lingering
on
the
palate
is
surprising
i
am
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
this
is
a
marzen
which
it
is
listed
as
or
another
type
of
german
lager
it
is
very
typical
of
most
german
lagers
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
final
note
this
beer
is
essentially
a
robust
pils
it
being
listed
as
marzenoctoberfest
is
a
bit
odd
to
me
weihenstephaner
festbier
is
a
good
little
noblehopped
lager
from
a
worldclass
outfit
even
though
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
offerings
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
its
going
up
against
some
pretty
stiff
competition
with
the
likes
of
hefeweissbier
and
korbinian
bottom
line
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
any
beer
that
has
weihenstephaner
on
the
label
far
more
helles
than
marzen
a
good
example
of
the
lighter
approach
to
festbier
that
we
hear
about
octoberfest
these
days
a
fine
social
beer
whether
eating
or
having
a
few
with
friends
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
light
could
drink
many
if
you
were
at
an
outside
type
of
event
not
what
i
expected
at
all
most
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
tasted
have
been
american
interpretations
so
dare
i
say
this
german
oktoberfest
is
out
of
style
yeah
i
guess
maybe
the
fest
in
the
festbier
is
so
enjoyable
those
participating
lack
the
capacity
to
differentiate
between
styles
or
more
likely
perhaps
this
festbier
is
from
a
warmer
region
in
germany
which
believes
a
lighter
munich
helles
or
pilsner
type
brew
greater
facilitates
the
oktoberfest
purchased
at
58
degrees
tucson
az
weihenstephaner
festbier
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
did
stick
around
very
long
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
im
only
getting
the
slightest
amounts
of
malt
taste
is
lighter
than
i
expected
for
an
oktoberfest
spicy
hops
dominate
its
a
little
sweet
and
there
is
a
flash
of
metallic
flavor
at
some
points
and
some
citric
flavors
are
also
present
this
is
very
drinkable
even
if
not
to
style
d
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
find
myself
not
being
able
to
stand
d
pretty
good
session
beer
it
aint
too
sweet
that
would
make
it
unbearable
after
a
few
over
time
but
yet
not
lack
luster
in
the
way
of
only
wanting
one
weihenstephaner
do
better
beers
than
this
a
little
dissapointing
actually
what
im
thinking
about
now
as
i
drink
this
is
oktoberfest
how
perfect
is
this
beer
for
such
an
event
easy
to
drink
rather
tasty
and
smells
good
good
mouth
good
drink
in
general
really
just
a
very
good
beer
to
have
over
and
over
and
over
again
whether
youre
paying
attention
to
it
or
not
pale
yellow
gold
color
no
head
light
to
moderate
carbonation
level
smell
of
traditional
german
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
a
wet
hay
smell
taste
is
very
clean
but
somehow
is
also
big
very
malty
with
the
hops
coming
through
strong
slight
metallic
finish
this
goes
down
fairly
light
and
easy
but
has
enough
flavor
to
give
it
some
interest
at
first
it
hints
at
being
a
typical
light
euro
beer
but
it
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
kick
not
bad
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
either
a
good
thirst
quencher
notes
not
at
all
what
i
expected
an
oktoberfest
to
be
like
this
is
way
more
like
a
helles
the
color
was
too
light
the
malt
flavor
and
aroma
wasnt
what
it
should
have
been
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
think
a
great
crossover
beer
as
well
but
not
what
id
seek
out
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
oktoberfest
mouthfeeldrinkability
in
the
mouth
it
stumbles
and
awkwardly
takes
its
first
steps
there
isnt
much
coordination
or
grace
here
the
beer
flattens
prematurely
and
although
not
terrible
isnt
interesting
in
the
least
it
feels
like
a
beer
brewed
to
be
guzzled
by
the
barrel
and
maybe
thats
the
intent
since
it
is
a
festbier
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
in
the
right
context
with
the
right
food
with
the
right
weather
damn
im
reaching
here
all
in
all
a
clean
honest
beer
for
the
fall
but
it
doesnt
even
rank
in
my
top
10
for
this
years
marzen
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
tastes
like
a
great
helles
does
not
taste
anything
like
any
marzen
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
still
pretty
darn
good
whatever
it
is

i
was
really
surprised
with
this
one
pours
an
awesome
head
with
good
lacing
down
the
glass
looks
more
like
a
pilsner
very
clean
looking
and
clear
unlike
most
festbiers
very
nutty
on
the
palate
with
some
nice
corny
and
bready
features
goes
down
smooth
seems
like
an
all
barley
malt
beer
highly
recommended
wish
id
have
picked
up
more
than
one
pours
a
pale
golden

quickly
turns
into

followed
by
some
more

the
spicey
hop
notes
that
were
present
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
that
is
a
bit
prickly
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
really
is
not
your
typical
marzen
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
unusual
appearance
for
an
oktoberfest
a
pale
golden
yellow
body
with
a
small
and
trim
vanilla
head
some
sparse
patchy

left
on

a
mixture
of
biscuity
lightly
toasted
pale
malt
and
earthy
and
spicy
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
healthy
medium
carbonation

the
expected

maltiness
assertive

the
taste
some
spicy
and
floral
hops
make
their
presence
known
as
well
maltiness
is
grainy
and
toasty
lacking
expected
sweetness
for
the
style
still
pretty
tasty
stuff
with
excellent
drinkability
more
sessionable
than
most
of
its
counterparts
light
in
the
mouth
as
it
should
be
but
i
would
like
more
crisp
from
the

aroma
along
with
some
floral
notes
good
amount
of
bready

which
is
still
pale

like
other
marzens
seems
almost
more
like
a

hops
balance
the
malt
very
well
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
this
was
way
too
easy
to
drink
i
could
picture
this
at
oktoberfest
in
a
gian
liter
mug
very
nice
although
not
very
much
like
other
marzens
the
beer
pours
a
limpid
golden
amber
color
the
head
is
statuesque
and
a
brilliant
white
creamy
in
texture
and
as
it
evaporates
the
lace
forms
a
tight
and
sealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
citrus
like
crispness
dominate
the
nose
fresh
clean
and
inviting
with
a
lightly
sweet
and
malt
laden
start
the

is
light
to
moderate
in

is
pleasing
in
its

the
acidity
mellow
the

desert
dry
and
a
fine

is
all
of
this

there
are
white
flecks
floating

in

head
that
has
staying
power
and
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
of
nutty
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
almost
fruity
hops
very
inviting
a
sort
of
sourdough
bread
flavor
like
a
bakery
in
a
bottle
a
rich
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
no
hop
bite
just
a
floral
reminder
to
add
to
the
tremendous
balance
wow
is
this
a
good
beer
its
not
necessarily
a
true
oktoberfest
since
the
bottle
has
a
xmas
wreath
adourning
its
label
a
brew
to
celebrate
any
season
search
it
out
if
you
can

what
theyre
good
at
and
that
is

overall
for
a
three
floyds
beer
this
was
fairly
normal
it
is
a
good
marzen

i

or
sausages
trying
the
munsterfest
for
a
third
time
but
i
now
have
a
chance
to
write
a
review
cracked
a
bottle
open
tonight
and
the
beer
pours
a
very
nice
clear
amber
i
left
a
heal
in
the
bottle
to
avoid
sediment
the
head
is
thin
and
white
and
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
is
fairly
faint
there
are
subtle
bittering
hops
and
slight
burnt
malt
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
marzen
style
and
probably
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
offering
oeasily
the
most
normal
beer
by
fff
though
it
lingers
on
shelves
for
a
reason
as
it
doesnt
do
anything
to
distinguish
itself
from
other
oktoberfests

forgot
to
mention
the

to
me
the
hops
in
this
particular
oktoberfest
lager
taste
far
more
citrusey
sp
biting
than
most
other
fests
ive
had
i
like
that
about
this
brew
with
the
sweetness
added
from
letting
it
sit
for
a
bit
this
makes
for
an
oktoberfest
that
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
lightly
foamy
14
but
mostly
smooth
34
mouthfeel
this
gives
the
beer
a
bit
too
much
of
a
syrupy
cloying
feel
on
the
palate
that
neither
works
well
for
this
beer
or
matches
expectations
for
the
style

of

had
m

of
medium

o
im
really
impressed
by
this
i
dont
usually
like
their
style
because
its
usually
very
malty
and
too
grainy
this
is
so
well
balanced
great
texture
nice
sweet
flavor
not
too
thick
in

im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
personally
this
a
lager
that
drinks
more
like
an
ale
it
definitely
has
marzen
characteristics
with
a
three
floyds
twist
its
not
exactly
a
traditional
example
of
the
style
but
its
close
enough
and
is
still
enjoyable
the
craftsmanship
is
clearly
there
overall
it
was
a
decent
octoberfest
nothing
to
rave
about
but
that
tends
to
be
the
case
for
me
with
this
style
it
very
rarely
wows
me
if
at
all
22

after

overall
this
is
a

style
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
fruity
and
malty
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
high
rated
beer
in
my
opinion
and
something
i
would
pick
up
every
season
pours
a
translucent
copperamber
color
with
a
shortlived
a
light
carameleggshell
colored

the
head
disappears
way
to
quickly
bubbles
constantly
migrate
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
wet
with
very
little
carbonation
so
little
that
i
wonder
if
this
bottle
is
old
not
much
going
on
on
the
nose
the
obligatory
toffee
but
on
the
very
light
side
some
notes
of
dark
red
fruit
flavor
is
pretty
lacking
not
bad
just
not
3f
the
flat
flavor
and
the
flat
mouthfeel
are
certainly
not
complimentary
im
so
familiar
with
3f
its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
bottle
is
not
old
really
glad
i
found
this
one
a
great
respresentation
of
the
style
particularly
from
an
american
brewer
simple
ingredients
in
just
the
right
ratios
make
this
a
beer
the
germans
would
be
proud
of
overall
a
really
really
good
beer
poured
a
hazy
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
sank
to
a
ringlet
bready

fairly
drinkable
an

overall
one
of
the
best
lager
style
beers
u
can
buy
so
try
it
o
pretty
average
to
the
genre
not
my
favor
but
pretty
good
overall
not
bad
a
little
underwhelming
but
a
standard
marzen
here
taste
is
octoberfestery
as
you
would
expect
ive
been
in
the
spirit
of
octoberfest
lately
so
ive
been
having
a
lot
of
these
beers
and
honestly
i
would
choose
the
revolution
octoberfest
over
this
smells
only
lightly
of
citrus
peel
and
nutmeg
spiciness
but
maintains
a
core
aroma
of
bready
caramel
malts
the
flavor
follows
suit
mostly
but
has
a
somewhat
higher
citrus
peel
accent
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hopping
its
serviceable
but
there
are
more
exciting
marzens
out
there
on
the
market
than
this
surprising
mostly
for
how
normal
this
beer
plays
out
for
a
brewery
with
the
slogan
of
its
not
normal
i
believe
it
may
be
the
black
sheep
of
their
lineup
in
this
regards
poured
an
amber
orange
hue
with
an
inch
of
creamy
white
foam
leaves
spots
of
lace
smell
is
malty
caramel
tastes
similar
to
smell
with
notes
of
caramel
and
malt
citric
bitterness
is
noticeable
and
not
as
sweet
as
id
like
to
see
for
the
style
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
decent
brew
but
not
a
fantastic
marzen
i
like
the
different
flavors
but
it
just
needed
a
bit
more
oopmf
o
let
me
start
by
saying
that
munsterfest
is
now
2
behind
the
glbc
oktoberfest
in
my
marzen
ranking
i
was
expecting
a
totally
different
brew
from
fff
but
this
hits
the
marzenoktoberfest
style
with
perfection
just
a
tasty
lager
meant
for
the
festive
autumn
season
great
flavor
and
a
bottle
full
of
sweetness
o
a
nice
beer
for
sure
i
was
a
bit
taken
back
by
the
lack
of
nose
on
this
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
came
to
the
rescue
well
done
for
the
style
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
and
overall
solid
overall
nice
tasty
and
smooth
alcohol
is
masked
well
malts
are
the
featured
flavor
everything
you
want
in
a
octoberfest
maybe
a
little
more
hoppy
then
most
but
its
solid
and
actually
a
safernormal
beer
from
3
floyds
and
that
i
feel
makes
most
not
enjoy
this
as
much
as
they
want
to
admit
worth
a
drink
for
sure
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
only
my
2nd
beer
from
three
floyds
and
its
definitely
a
good
representation
of
the
style
im
not
sure
why
but
as
good
as
it
is
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
still
not
too
far
behind
great
lakes
and
barktoberfest
o
this
is
a
beer
anybody
could
drink
and
be
happy
with
but
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
out
of
three
floyds
this
one
is
good
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
brewerys
reputation
or
the
price
tag
o
pretty
good
simple
but
good
overall
3
5
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
except
for
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
o
ive
come
to
really
dig
this
style
munsterfest
has
a
really
nice
flavor
and
feel
and
an
oktoberfest
id
be
happy
to
drink
every
fall
o
overall
a
great
beer
a
little
bit
sweeter
than
most
oktoberfests
o
probably
my
least
favorite
3f
thus
far
but
on
the
other
hand
better
than
many
oktoberfests
ive
had
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
color
aroma
of
bready
malts
and
citrusy
hops
upfront
in
the
taste
biscuit
and
mild
grapefruit
flavors
bitterness
is
pretty
pronounced
along
with
more
bready
flavor
lightly
roasted
malts
citrusy
and
bitter
for
an
oktoberfest
but
quite
nice
and
in
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
oktoberfest
style
and
a
quality
hoppy
lager
decent
drinker
but
nothing
special
perhaps
better
when
at
relase
no
freshness
dating
so
we
will
never
know
would
do
better
as
a
keller
bier
imo
o
i
was
pretty
stoked
about
trying
this
brew
i
typically
really
enjoy
anything
by
three
floyds
not
to
mention
i
had
read
this
was
the
gold
medal
winner
in
the
marzen
category
at
the
2011
gabf
unfortunately
i
was
slightly
disappointed
it
wasnt
bad
but
ill
be
sticking
to
the
wisconsin
brewers
and
german
imports
for
my
oktoberfest
beers
d
clean
and
pleasant
taste
refreshing
lager
characteristics
make
this
an
enjoyable
beer
for
anytime
of
the
day
from
dinner
to
summertime
o
its
an
oktoberfest
what
can
i
say
ive
never
had
one
that
was
interesting
or
complex
but
thats
not
really
the
purpose
of
the
style
that
said
id
rather
have
a
spaten
overall
pretty
standard
marzen
and
even
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
expected
more
from
three
floyds
but
nevertheless
very
well
done
o
all
the
characteristics
of
a
traditional
marzen
are
here
nothing
crazy
or
earth
shattering
going
on
just
a
nice
classic
example
of
the
style
not
exactly
terrible
but
pretty
unremarkable
meh
o
a
bit
darker
than
expected
but
i
enjoyed
that
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
nice
traditional
oktoberfest
flavor
of
toasted
malt
fresh
bread
candy
corn
and
spice
wellbalanced
with
hops
in
fact
this
one
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
zing
than
a
few
others
ive
had
this
year
one
expects
a
beer
from
3f
to
be
anything
but
normal
but
they
seem
to
have
minded
their
manners
here
and
delivered
a
good
traditional
oktoberfest
beer
like
all
good
oktoberfest
beers
this
one
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
drinkable
pity
about
the
price
overall
this
is
quite
a
delicious
beer
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
under
attenuated
for
the
style
but
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
will
seek
this
out
and
drink
it
again
overall
this
is
a
rich
malty
and
easy
to
drink
lager
exactly
what
youd
expect
for
a
marzen
or
oktoberfest
great
malt
complexity
without
being
overly
cloying
very
drinkable
a
very
reserved
beer
from
fff
but
extremely
delicious
nonetheless
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
o
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
offering
from
fff
this
one
was
good
and
pretty
true
to
the
style
without
too
many
of
the
normal
fff
curve
balls
i
would
definitely
buy
a
couple
for
the
fall
season
o
a
very
very
nice
oktoberfest
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
a
really
good
drinking
beer
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
good
malt
flavors
and
great
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
beer
for
the
style
wow
i
thought
from
the
smell
this
would
be
kind
of
hohum
but
the
taste
really
impressed
unfortunately
it
didnt
impress
me
as
representative
of
the
style
it
is
way
too
fruity
still
tasty
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
id
definitley
put
another
of
these
down
if
given
the
chance
munsterfest
is
an
interesting
beer
from
three
floyds
generally
their
beer
is
pretty
aggressive
full
of
flavor
and
a
little
in
your
face
while
munsterfest
is
none
of
those
it
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
its
tasty
and
features
a
nice
little
twist
with
citric
hops
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
balanced
reserved
effort
from
three
floyds
still
good
beer
though
definitely
worth
checking
out
o
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
but
not
one
of
the
top
still
i
would
have
this
again
cheers
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
need
a
big
stein
glass
so
i
can
pour
the
entire
bomber
into
it
and
give
a
hearty
prost
to
my
neighbor
mouthfeel
and
overall
definitely
a
dry
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
though
i
did
crave
water
as
i
drank
it
es
ist
nicht
normal
eh
well
and
tannic
finish
with
light
esters
too
in
all
that

this
is
a
very
nice
but
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
pop
much
more
than
it
did
a
very
restrained
beer
from
fff
that
is
really
quite
average
the
bottle
proudly
indicates
es
ist
nicht
normal
i
read
on
the
label
once
that
this
was
brewed
according
to
the
reinheitsgebot
and
then
did
a
doubletake
as
i
struggled
with
the
thought
of
the
floyds
brewing
something
so
ordinarysounding
and
historically
pure
for
lack
of
a
better
word
figured
id
have
to
try
it
out
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
bronzestraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
cracked
wheat
buttery
biscuits
light
nutmeg
honey
light
caramel
and
a
few
scraps
of
grapefruit
rind
the
taste
primarily
follows
the
grainy
path
made
from
the
elements
above
but
with
a
nice
twinge
of
orange
and
grapefruit
zests
the
honey
and
caramel
also
pop
in
at
various
points
so
as
to
ensure
that
everything
isnt
all
grassy
malt
and
whatnot
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
appropriately
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
ofestlike
brew
nicely
balanced
and
surprisingly
refreshing
right
on
o
my
least
favorite
three
floyds
beer
so
far
the
skunkiness
wasnt
enough
to
totally
put
me
off
but
the
thin
palate
and
even
thinner
body
make
this
a
beer
im
not
planning
on
going
back
to
oh
well
i
cant
stay
mad
at
three
floyds
for
that
long
broo
doo
will
be
here
in
a
week
this
was
a
very
good
domestic
and
enjoyable
oktoberfest
not
super
malty
but
with
more
hops
to
it
served
in
a
stein
glass
at
3
floyds
pours
an
almost
amber
with
a
good
head
the
retention
is
pretty
amazing
this
is
a
pretty
solid
tasting
brew
it
as
an
easy
drinker
but
still
has
some
substance
i
am
not
extremely
familiar
with
this
style
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
o
first
time
trying
this
fff
release
its
decent
but
nothing
seems
to
stand
out
for
me
worth
a
try
but
not
certain
i
would
seek
this
out
again
especially
considering
the
price
o
a
nice
octoberfest
very
light
and
enjoyable
perfect
for
the
warmer
months
of
fallend
of
summer
overall
this
is
a
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
for
an
american
brewery
but
fails
a
big
short
for
me
because
it
lacks
the
certain
crisp
and
clean
quality
of
the
traditional
german
styles
dont
break
your
back
to
find
it
but
it
is
worth
a
go
if
you
stumble
across
it
medium
mouthfeel
i
would
pick
this
over
any
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
in
the
fall
but
im
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
decent
offering
overall
doverall
for
its
style
i
was
very
impressed
im
kinda
confused
as
on
the
bottle
it
says
lager
but
on
here
it
says
its
style
is
oktoberfest
but
no
matter
which
it
is
i
think
its
very
flavorful
for
the
style
and
didnt
exspect
much
of
it
when
i
picked
up
the
bottle
but
thought
it
was
quite
tasty
i
would
def
get
this
again
big
thanks
goes
out
to
enelson
for
this
one
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
pumpkin
and
sweet
potato
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
sweet
potato
brown
sugar
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
for
the
style
got
this
one
awhile
back
and
found
it
while
consolidating
my
cellar
still
had
an
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
here
though
if
you
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
at
least
try
this
one
once
you
wont
regret
it
o
prosit
i
think
fff
should
sell
6packs
of
this
stuff
and
charge
the
same
price
i
just
paid
for
a
750ml
bottle
10
for
a
bomber
huh
this
is
the
only
real
problem
i
found
with
this
brew
d
a
tasty
oktoberfest
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
bolder
coming
from
3
floyds
thanks
to
hurfer
for
this
bottle
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
deep
orangeamber
color
light
haze
to
it
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
disspates
aroma
has
a
very
sweet
profile
as
a
whole
with
a
good
amount
of
grainy
malt
nose
very
strong
noble
hops
profile
with
a
combination
of
sweet
grassy
and
spicy
notes
and
finishes
with
a
light
soured
malt
note
flavor
starts
off
with
a
strong
hay
and
light
toasted
malt
note
early
cereal
with
noble
hops
grassy
finish
body
is
very
light
which
i
suspect
is
from
the
low
carbonation
present
in
the
brew
texture
is
kinda
watery
overall
a
big
disappointment
as
the
nose
is
unimpressive
and
the
texture
of
the
brew
really
doesnt
help
the
lackluster
flavor
there
are
better
oktoberfest
brews
out
there
another
solid
offering
from
three
floyds
sturdy
body
with
wellbalanced
malt
notes
caramel
is
predominant
but
at
an
appropriate
level
perhaps
a
touch
more
hops
than
traditionally
found
in
the
style
but
still
wellwithin
the
traditional
profile
a
bit
bigger
and
bolder
than
some
and
that
is
good
overall
a
solid
marzen
that
was
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
still
worth
trying
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
its
a
bit
too
much
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
my
indy
trip
rotation
would
like
to
try
again
closer
to
the
release
and
ontap
not
my
go
to
style
but
worth
a
bottle
a
season
oo
d
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
medium
bodied
well
balanced
i
would
for
sure
get
this
brew
again
another
great
brew
from
three
floyds
i
recommend
this
brew
overall
a
nice
marzen
style
beer
i
enjoyed
way
more
than
i
expected
to
im
usually
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
the
smooth
malt
flavors
clean
finish
and
high
drinkability
really
impressed
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
d
i
would
enjoy
a
few
glasses
of
this
beer
with
some
bbq
or
pickled
eggs
drinkability
is
good
and
the
abv
is
just
right
beer
is
pretty
malty
nice
bready
mouthfeel
forward
flavors
are
slightly
sweet
finishes
cleanly
and
not
too
dry
for
a
marzen
its
quite
good
the
malt
backbone
is
well
thought
out
with
good
connectivity
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
would
appreciate
a
little
more
creativity
from
3f
as
they
tend
to
do
pours
a
light
rusty
brown
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
mode
brings
some
slight
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
bunch
of
doughy
malt
taste
is
quite
bready
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
background
light
to
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
drinks
well
but
nothig
all
that
special
about
it
if
you
like
marzens
then
check
out
this
beer
it
is
unique
enough
to
hold
the
interest
of
even
oktoberfest
skeptics
d
ok
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
to
me
the
beer
itself
is
nothing
like
fff
beers
per
say
its
well
crafted
i
think
and
this
leads
to
the
drinkability
of
it
the
alcohol
on
this
is
low
enough
that
a
bomber
plus
some
is
a
easy
goal
for
me
to
obtain
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
ive
been
enjoying
the
octoberfest
and
harvest
ales
lately
as
a
relief
from
the
ipas
that
i
have
barraged
my
palette
with
all
summer
the
color
is
just
as
pretty
and
red
as
the
leaves
that
decorate
the
trees
here
in
the
midwest
the
flavor
is
calm
and
smooth
atypical
of
what
fffs
usually
prides
themselves
on
i
think
the
calm
and
subtle
flavors
would
start
to
disappear
after
more
than
a
pint
or
two
which
is
disappointing
i
cant
say
that
its
my
favorite
harvest
ale
but
fff
have
continued
to
brew
beers
that
i
continue
to
enjoy
and
look
forward
to
i
still
love
three
floyds
but
i
am
going
to
never
have
this
again
i
love
all
their
other
stuff
that
i
have
had
but
alright
so
every
brewery
makes
a
black
sheep
they
tried
to
make
a
beer
similar
to
a
recipe
from
two
hundred
years
ago
and
good
i
am
sure
back
then
it
was
the
greatest
thing
ever
but
this
recipe
could
use
an
update
dquite
drinkable
though
it
would
be
a
hefty
session
beer
i
liked
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
night
but
only
if
an
elite
marzen
wasnt
available
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
light
caramel
amber
color
fizzy
with
light
head
smell
is
rich
caramel
malts
graham
cracker
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
sweet
with
more
brown
sugar
caramel
and
grain
hops
are
very
minimal
alcohol
presence
is
very
low
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
sweet
oktoberfest
d
easily
drinkable
nice
representation
of
the
style
d
one
of
the
best
marzens
ive
had
as
of
yet
truly
enjoyable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
a
bar
some
night
certainly
if
3f
ever
wanted
to
make
something
for
the
masses
then
dropping
this
into
cans
would
surely
sell
out
but
if
youre
looking
for
their
monthly
edition
of
crazy
in
a
bottle
wait
until
november
this
has
some
winelike
quality
for
some
reason
carbonation
is
a
little
much
for
me
and
would
like
to
see
more
body
i
think
they
were
going
for
high
drinkability
and
missed
color
is
mahogany
and
a
bit
on
the
orange
side
smell
is
woody
and
citris
with
a
bit
of
a
banana
tone
a
bit
sweet
upfront
with
a
certain
tartness
following
it
kind
of
mellows
out
with
the
sweetness
lingering
a
bit
but
there
is
very
little
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
not
overly
aggressive
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
my
first
marzen
i
like
it
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
if
anything
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
with
a
beautifully
light
dryness
from
the
alcohol
nicely
drinkable
but
not
exceptionally
so
drinkability
is
good
overall
back
off
on
the
carbonation
a
little
and
boost
the
body
to
make
it
fuller
richer
and
this
is
dead
on
and
award
worthy
as
it
is
its
good
but
ive
had
other
oktoberfestmarzen
beers
that
are
truer
to
style
than
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rolls
off
the
tongue
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
can
drink
all
day
glass
after
glass
i
cant
help
but
notice
written
multiple
times
on
the
bottle
is
es
ist
nicht
normal
directly
translating
into
it
is
not
normal
i
couldnt
agree
more
three
floyds
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangish
amber
color
with
fleeting
coarse
bubbles
everything
but
the
cloudiness
is
typical
to
the
style
the
smell
has
the
hints
of
malts
and
orange
zest
that
is
typical
to
the
style
but
i
detect
hints
of
banana
and
clove
which
i
must
say
is
unexpected
for
the
style
the
wheat
aroma
is
also
confusing
particularly
why
it
is
there
the
taste
comes
on
with
an
unreal
smoothness
but
quickly
punches
you
in
the
face
with
its
bitter
undercurrents
the
bitterness
almost
seems
to
come
from
a
roasted
malt
flavor
rather
than
the
expected
bitterness
from
hops
the
mouthfeel
takes
some
getting
used
to
smooth
and
bitter
is
a
not
often
seen
combo
the
drinkability
is
fairly
easy
to
handle
and
overall
its
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
for
the
right
price
and
are
a
connoisseur
of
the
style
i
say
have
at
it
its
a
different
approach
to
the
style
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
but
the
fruits
sweet
caramel
and
gravity
gives
this
beer
something
thats
definately
not
normal
in
traditional
oktoberfest
beers
alcohol
isnt
high
so
and
its
not
a
full
bodied
beer
so
it
goes
down
with
ease
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
have
this
on
tap
next
time
however
down
it
goes
and
goes
down
with
ease
a
solid
ofest
and
no
real
surprise
from
3f
that
they
can
actually
make
a
beer
to
a
specific
style
that
its
suppose
to
be
drinkability
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
might
have
it
again
but
only
for
lack
of
better
options
poured
a
bottle
from
2009
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
smoothly
and
a
pumpkin
pie
burnt
orange
it
had
a
light
cream
colored
head
which
dissipated
within
a
minute
the
smell
isnt
anything
too
special
its
definitely
malty
and
has
a
light
coffee
spicy
aroma
to
it
the
taste
definitely
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
aromas
its
a
little
sweet
and
definitely
has
that
falltime
flavor
its
a
little
spicy
and
appealingly
so
it
makes
me
wish
it
were
autumn
already
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
the
age
on
the
bottle
definitely
killed
the
carbonation
but
gave
it
the
mouthfeel
similar
to
an
aged
dfh
750ml
this
beer
may
now
be
one
of
my
top
three
oktoberfests
its
extremely
drinkable
and
both
tasty
and
thirst
quenching
if
only
it
were
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
toffee
and
bready
malts
the
flavor
is
more
complex
with
bread
caramel
toffee
and
grapes
mixing
together
low
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
beer
tastes
very
clean
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
i
thought
it
was
a
good
lager
that
did
the
style
some
justice
and
really
ever
dissapointed
on
fff
offerings
im
not
big
on
lagers
but
this
one
makes
the
cut
im
no
aficionado
of
the
style
but
im
not
digging
this
example
very
much
the
taste
has
some
oktoberfest
characteristics
but
overall
it
isnt
an
impressive
representation
of
the
style
it
like
other
american
takes
on
german
styles
has
sort
of
a
cat
urine
flavor
i
tasted
the
same
thing
in
prima
pils
i
think
it
is
the
misuse
of
noble
hops
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
pretty
small
head
head
retention
is
low
and
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
light
but
nice
it
smells
like
bready
malt
toffee
and
some
caramel
this
brew
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
malty
and
sweet
good
thing
the
taste
is
stronger
compared
to
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
slick
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
realize
that
this
bottle
isnt
exactly
fresh
so
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
when
a
fresher
batch
comes
out
mouthfeel
was
full
and
smooth
slick
even
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
it
seems
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
oktoberfests
ive
come
across
d
i
would
like
to
see
a
higher
abv
on
this
one
but
then
again
it
wouldnt
be
a
traditional
marzen
but
then
again
fff
isnt
a
traditional
brewery
whats
nice
about
this
brew
is
that
unlike
other
fests
i
doubt
it
gets
dumbed
down
every
year
i
will
look
forard
to
this
one
on
draft
this
fall
45
d
drinkable
not
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
drinks
well
herea
bit
out
of
season
but
definitely
refreshing
drinkabiity
is
good
a
heavy
lager
that
would
be
better
if
lighter
d
drinkability
is
average
at
best
this
beer
is
just
too
bland
this
beer
is
not
even
close
to
being
worth
8
a
bomber
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
was
pretty
easy
to
finish
the
bomber
during
the
beginning
of
the
super
bowl
this
evening
its
lighter
bodied
and
full
flavored
making
it
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
found
it
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
bottle
poured
a
dirty
golden
color
ale
with
a
tiny
foamy
head
with
light
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
overly
sweet
malt
with
some
grainy
cereal
cereal
is
more
or
less
interesting
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
grainy
cereal
with
some
overly
sweet
notes
body
has
an
oily
texture
with
medium
carbonation
not
sure
i
get
what
the
goal
was
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
lacking
caramel
malt
notes
at
8
for
a
22
oz
bottle
i
find
this
to
be
ridiculously
overpriced
for
an
oktoberfest
brew
pours
a
cloudy
iced
tea
orange
with
a
shallow
loose
off
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
negligible
lacing
the
smell
is
aggressive
with
a
rich
malty
sweetness
mixed
with
toffee
apple
notes
adequately
carbonated
and
tangy
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
full
flavored
the
malty
caramel
and
harvest
fruit
taste
is
complimented
nicely
by
the
texture
and
lingers
appropriately
with
a
slightly
salty
character
one
heck
of
a
nice
drinker
tastes
like
a
ton
of
quality
ingredients
quite
sessionable
especially
at
6
abv
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
this
one
during
the
game
beat
army
hazy
deep
golden
thin
dirty
white
head
barely
any
lace
malty
aroma
but
not
overly
rich
or
thick
a
little
apple
fruitiness
as
well
on
the
nose
pretty
plain
flavor
just
like
the
nose
its
malty
but
not
overly
so
and
there
is
definitely
an
apple
like
presence
which
is
a
little
awkward
body
is
pretty
lifeless
easily
the
most
unimpressive
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
i
coulda
had
a
sixer
of
staghorn
instead
of
this
bomber
it
is
what
it
is
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
only
the
hops
are
a
lot
bigger
and
the
cinnamon
much
bolder
almost
at
spotted
cow
levels
starts
for
a
marzen
big
bouquet
of
spices
and
light
flowers
moving
into
sweeter
bockier
middle
with
dry
american
hops
and
ending
on
a
long
lingering
blend
of
hops
spice
and
malt
sweetness
really
nice
overall
a
very
nice
fest
beer
per
the
usual
recipe
at
three
floyds
a
fest
beer
with
some
muscle
drinkability
a
tasty
oktoberfest
and
another
fine
offering
from
fff
d
very
drinkable
beer
abv
is
manageable
flavors
are
solid
and
not
overwhelming
not
filling
although
certainly
a
noticeable
body
to
it
conclusion
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
its
my
first
fff
beer
but
i
must
say
while
this
is
in
no
way
bad
it
was
just
underwhelming
and
not
really
worth
the
8
00
a
bomber
imho
the
mouthfeel
is
liight
not
very
drinkable
d
im
enjoying
this
one
i
dont
typically
like
many
of
the
lager
styles
but
the
octoberfest
beers
are
usually
the
exception
and
tis
that
time
of
year
the
munsterfest
is
not
disappointing
me
i
only
wish
i
had
a
giant
pretzel
or
a
bratwurst
to
go
with
it
the
smell
puts
its
bready
malt
foot
forward
with
just
a
little
bit
of
lemon
peel
and
banana
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
satisfying
biscuit
leadin
a
subtle
taste
of
citrus
in
the
middle
and
a
measured
bitter
finish
while
id
love
to
see
fff
take
this
style
off
the
deep
end
this
beer
shows
that
they
can
succeed
at
a
more
subtle
task
a
pretty
decent
fest
bier
ayinger
is
still
the
best
but
this
is
actually
a
bit
close
to
it
in
that
its
balanced
good
stuff
650ml
bomber
purchased
fresh
from
friar
tucks
in
peoria
the
beer
is
hazytranslucent
and
dark
orange
color
with
an
extremely
thin
wispy
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
fresh
bread
and
i
guess
a
hint
of
esters
this
stuff
is
delicious
i
think
ive
found
my
favorite
oktoberfest
sweet
and
bready
a
little
grassland
hops
pleasant
overall
this
is
what
oktoberfests
should
taste
like
definitive
and
near
perfect
horray
for
munster
nicely
crafted
went
down
easily
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
flawed
beer
that
has
good
things
going
for
it
but
needs
more
attention
from
the
brewers
if
they
make
it
again
next
fall
season
i
have
enjoyed
most
of
their
lagers
and
this
one
just
needs
a
bit
of
improvement
the
deep
malt
flavor
almost
saves
it
pours
a
very
nice
semidark
copper
color
although
with
just
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
deep
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
pepper
nose
and
a
bit
of
hoppiness
nice
deep
malty
scent
hints
of
pepper
and
clove
like
a
german
wheat
beer
and
a
good
malthop
finish
goes
down
fine
if
not
the
smoothest
a
nice
marzen
but
not
the
best
and
not
3fs
best
brew
either
still
definitely
good
enough
to
drink
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
oktoberfest
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easy
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
the
aroma
is
definitely
not
normal
with
corn
caramel
grassy
hops
and
fruit
the
appearance
is
amber
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
bad
overall
its
not
great
but
it
is
interesting
i
would
have
another
overall
very
drinkable
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
fff
but
its
still
a
very
legit
brew
could
be
a
little
darker
and
more
bitter
then
i
would
have
been
totally
satisfied
copper
color
with
no
head
and
little
life
on
the
carbonation
side
very
bland
looking
beer
that
dosnt
get
you
too
exicited
smell
kicks
it
up
a
notch
toasty
malts
with
some
caramel
and
a
little
more
hops
that
is
normal
for
the
style
hops
are
earthy
in
nature
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malts
on
the
toastybready
side
of
things
clean
crisp
finish
a
real
interesting
departure
for
three
floyds
overall
a
nice
brew
that
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
a
very
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
beer
from
three
floyds
d
this
is
definitely
one
of
fffs
most
approachable
beers
refreshing
and
clean
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
enjoy
d
a
heavy
ofest
still
a
well
drinking
beer
drinkability
suffers
form
the
sweetness
really
builds
the
more
you
drink
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beer
to
produce
a
slick
feel
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
what
a
beer
geek
would
expect
from
fff
poured
a
slightly
hazed
copper
into
my
sa
beer
drinking
glass
nice
1
finger
of
fluffy
nearwhite
head
sweetness
detected
on
the
aroma
with
some
nuts
thrown
in
sweet
toasted
malt
flavor
with
some
caramel
crisp
in
the
body
somewhat
nutty
with
a
balanced
hop
bitterness
hoppier
than
most
of
its
german
relatives
spicy
hop
finish
and
pretty
good
overall
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
tasty
or
interesting
enough
to
want
to
d
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
definitely
doesnt
blow
my
doors
off
but
it
gets
the
job
done
a
nice
version
of
a
favorite
style
of
mine
flavor
starts
off
light
and
crisp
with
a
spicy
bite
hitting
the
sides
of
the
tongue
notes
of
light
peppery
hops
drop
out
of
the
middle
before
the
profile
culminates
in
a
finish
of
amber
malt
nuts
spice
and
some
zesty
yeastiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
mediumhigh
carbonation
level
adds
an
invigorating
feel
to
the
beer
that
gives
some
pep
to
the
more
subtle
spices
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
the
oktoberfest
style
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
its
growing
on
me
what
else
do
you
expect
from
three
floyds
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
very
solid
brew
thanks

thanks
to
ohlrangers
for
providing
this
bomber
courtesy
of
the
lif
route
a
process
that
is
soon
to
appear
in
a
city
near
you
provided
youre
lucky
enough
d
goes
down
easy
and
it
isnt
too
filling
highly
sessionable
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
this
season
drinkability
high
d
very
drinkable
probably
the
best
fest
bier
i
have
had
this
year
highly
sessionable
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
the
oktoberfest
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
plus
at
only
5
59
its
probably
the
cheapest
fff
bomber
ive
ever
bought
caramel
flavors
malty
not
much
hop
presence
finishes
kind
of
dry
something
in
there
reminds
me
of
fall
leaves
light
bodied
easy
enough
to
quaff
a
pint
not
especially
complex
but
a
nice
way
to
usher
in
the
fall
season
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
solid
choice
for
sure
it
was
not
as
complex
as
most
fff
brews
tend
to
be
but
in
this
case
that
is
absolutely
fine
a
good
quality
session
able
beer
the
this
time
of
year
i
would
have
no
issues
with
getting
this
one
again
d
just
so
so
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
short
lasting
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
aromas
are
mostly
munich
and
vienna
malts
toasty
and
bready
not
really
any
biscuit
quite
a
bit
of
noble
hop
notes
including
some
floral
and
slightly
spicy
tones
just
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
palate
it
hits
incredibly
smooth
the
bready
caramel
like
malt
character
really
dominates
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
for
balance
a
very
clean
lager
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
no
fruitiness
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
to
find
an
oktoberfest
this
time
of
year
regardless
of
how
old
this
bottle
is
afterthought
im
pretty
sure
that
this
bottle
is
a
bit
old
and
out
of
date
considering
the
low
carbonation
and
lack
of
head
oh
that
and
the
fact
that
im
reviewing
an
oktoberfest
beer
in
january
i
have
taken
this
into
account
in
my
ratings
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
forms
that
quickly
dissolves
away
th
carbonation
is
strongly
visible
through
the
from
top
to
bottom
the
sweet
scent
of
malt
dominates
the
aroma
with
touches
of
a
light
citrus
fragrance
at
the
end
the
malt
is
the
strength
of
the
flavor
it
solid
all
the
way
through
there
is
not
much
hop
bitterness
a
light
citrus
flavor
at
the
end
but
nothing
to
dominant
a
surprise
from
three
floyds
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
carbonation
does
not
deter
from
this
very
smooth
medium
bodied
feel
i
like
this
beer
though
i
am
partial
to
marzen
i
was
expecting
somewhat
of
a
hop
kick
being
from
three
floyds
that
takes
nothing
away
from
this
very
good
beer
mouthfeel
was
fine
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
was
too
strong
for
the
style
still
a
quality
beer
not
worth
the
money
to
me
though
drinkability
hmmm
this
isnt
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
fff
this
is
a
very
balanced
normal
brew
that
is
right
on
for
the
style
its
a
terrific
oktoberfest
that
isnt
really
a
crazy
american
interpretation
great
job
by
fff
solid
beer
great
brewery
much
thanks
to
theodorherzl
tasters
note
thanks
to
amatuerbeerguy
for
this
one
tastes
pretty
nice
but
not
what
i
expected
for
a
marzen
it
has
more
pilsner
notes
theres
some
nice
hops
fruit
grass
wheat
and
the
brew
is
well
carbonated
feels
slick
and
slightly
creamy
and
is
pretty
easy
to
down
on
a
chilly
fall
night
this
goes
down
smooth
with
more
toasted
malts
balanced
by
a
nice
bit
of
hops
for
an
oktoberfest
it
isnt
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
three
floyds
but
thats
ok
much
like
the
prize
ale
theyve
again
shown
their
talent
with
sublime
subtle
brews
they
dont
all
have
to
have
alpha
kings
supercharged
flavor
i
like
this
its
superbly
drinkable
and
doesnt
fizzle
on
the
palate
either
well
done
bomber
pours
a
mostly
clear
radiant
orange
body
with
a
small
and
fleeting
beige
head
sticky
fleck
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
toasted
grain
caramel
and
spicyherbal
hops
light
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
toasty
nutty
and
caramel
maltiness
that
is
complimented
by
a
subtle
spicy
hop
bitterness
very
well
constructed
lager
that
rivals
some
of
the
better
german
examples
of
the
style
d
worth
9
not
quite
but
still
good
and
made
for
an
enjoyable
night
beer
pours
near
bronze
with
little
to
no
head
which
dissipates
immediately
the
beer
has
a
sweet
smell
that
is
soon
overpowered
by
alcohol
and
corn
unpleasant
the
corn
taste
dominates
and
sits
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
tastes
like
a
roided
out
budvar
i
have
so
much
faith
in
fff
but
i
will
not
be
having
another
taking
into
consideration
where
i
purchased
this
from
it
should
be
very
fresh
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
stein
liquid
was
amber
with
a
white
head
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
slightly
sweet
and
minimal
hops
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
that
fades
to
a
dry
stylelike
finish
lacked
the
hops
i
was
expecting
from
fff
very
drinkable
like
and
ofest
should
be
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
ample
carbonation
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
dry
crispness
on
the
finish
quite
an
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
it
doesnt
really
set
itself
apart
from
others
in
the
style
very
much
but
overall
is
a
tasty
enjoyable
oktoberfest
that
lives
up
to
the
style
as
one
of
the
floyds
few
bottled
lagers
its
one
id
probably
come
back
to
again
im
so
glad
that
orbitalr0x
sent
you
my
way
in
a
good
trade
amusing
label
on
this
bomber
poured
into
a
nonic
this
was
a
hazy
apricotamber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
creamy
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
but
for
me
the
head
is
one
of
the
least
important
characteristics
of
a
beer
smell
of
sweet
caramel
malts
is
prevelant
before
your
nose
gets
near
the
glass
some
faint
vegetal
notes
are
also
detected
upon
further
inspection
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
both
present
some
interesting
contrasts
as
it
starts
out
sweet
and
mediumbodiedviscous
and
quickly
cleans
out
to
dry
light
and
spritzy
this
may
be
the
only
3fs
beer
ive
ever
had
where
the
hops
did
not
assume
a
prominent
role
in
this
one
they
only
play
to
a
light
bitterness
in
the
background
and
the
aformentioned
vegetal
notes
in
the
nose
i
give
this
one
high
marks
for
its
complex
mouthfeel
and
cleansing
finish
it
makes
for
a
beer
youd
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
should
be
noted
that
im
pretty
sure
they
make
this
for
a
fall
release
and
having
bought
it
in
june
they
just
put
these
out
in
a
new
section
at
the
local
binnys
im
pretty
sure
this
is
past
its
prime
but
it
was
good
nonetheless
and
did
not
seem
lightstruck
will
definitely
revisit
this
if
a
fresh
batch
is
rereleased
this
coming
fall
not
the
clean
malt
profile
of
an
ayinger
oktoberfest
but
still
tasty
this
is
a
spoton
great
maerzen
come
fall
i
will
be
no
doubt
shelling
out
way
too
much
money
for
this
overpriced
bomber
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
roasty
carmel
malts
taste
is
dissapointing
very
malty
with
a
little
too
much
sweetness
and
not
enough
hops
mouthfeel
is
average
pretty
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
am
hoping
this
was
just
an
old
bottle
i
will
get
some
fresh
as
soon
as
its
available
overall
a
tasty
oktoberfest
very
drinkable
prosit

a
great
brew
in
the
style
from
one
of
the
best
slàinte
this
is
another
great
offering
from
the
fff
brewery
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
may
be
a
bit
past
its
prime
so
i
will
try
again
in
the
future
easy
to
drink
but
flavor
is
just
a
bit
off
all
and
all
a
solid
lager
had
a
nice
tast
profile
but
yet
very
quaffable
quite
enjoyable
three
floyds
is
proud
of
the
its
not
normal
nature
of
their
beer
as
they
should
be
for
this
germanstyle
offering
theyve
amended
their
tagline
to
read
es
ist
nicht
normal
munsterfest
is
probably
the
most
normal
thing
they
brew
but
its
still
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
style
and
shows
that
these
guys
arent
just
hop
fanatics
what
this
beer
has
shown
me
is
that
3f
can
be
successful
at
whatever
they
set
their
minds
to
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
something
that
demands
the
fff
premium
finally
gave
in
and
grabbed
a
munsterfest
off
the
shelf
of
the
liquor
store
in
town
the
beer
poured
out
of
the
22
oz
bottle
to
a
hazy
orangish
brown
in
my
mug
decent
carbonation
but
little
head
retention
sweet
earthy
malt
smell
nothing
that
over
powers
though
taste
is
the
same
with
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
in
there
the
hop
bite
starts
and
the
sweet
malt
finishes
as
i
swallow
which
i
enjoyed
feels
a
bit
thick
and
chewy
not
over
bearing
in
those
regards
i
put
this
on
the
same
drinkability
as
sam
adams
octoberfest
i
could
polish
of
a
few
bombers
if
i
so
desired
a
very
simple
american
oktoberfest
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bitterness
than
normal
but
overall
a
very
nice
simple
drinkable
marzen
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
short
fluffy
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
smells
of
lager
yeast
honey
and
apricots
as
well
as
light
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
dissappointing
it
is
more
reminiscent
of
an
imperial
pilsner
or
craft
malt
liquor
than
it
is
an
oktoberfest
its
very
malty
very
little
hops
in
the
front
fairly
sweet
in
the
middle
as
well
as
some
apricot
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
creamy
and
very
smooth
very
restrained
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
bit
odd
interpretation
of
the
style
poured
into
an
imperial

formed
a
minimal

down

quickly
with
average
to
good

lightly
of
nutty
malt
and
fruitiness
taste
follows
along
with
a
nutty
grain
husk
flavor
upfront
and
hopping
to
balance
for
the
rest
of
the
experience
with
maybe
a
touch
of
fruitiness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
nice

not

myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
all
the
flavors
meld
very
well
its
malty
without
being
too
sweet
and
theres
just
enough
hops
to
keep
the
malt
in
line
if
only
fff
would
do
a
dryhopped
version
of
thisgbvdavenov
16
with
a
peppery
noble
hop
spiceyness
which
is
weird
because
its
not
at
all
the
same
style
highly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
way
to
go
map
room
aforbes10oct

a
refreshing
and
very
solid
beer
in
the
style
very
lacking
in
carbonation
though
smells
truly
wonderful
toasty
buttery
caramel
taste
is
quite
different
from
most
oktoberfest
styles
ive
tried
as
its
rich
with
warm
roasty
caramel
flavor
yet
very
light
and
bubbly
on
the
palate
extremely
welcoming
and
drinkable
im
a
little
underwhelmed
considering
i
really
like
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
its
not
bad
but
nothing
about
really
makes
me
want
to
have
another
one
copper
legend
is
a
beer
made
to
high
standards
ive
come
to
expect
as
much
from
jacks
abby
but
does
it
live
up
to
the
highest
standards
of
them
all
german
standards
absolutely
if
your
märzen
can
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
any
of
the
original
iconic
producers
then
youve
clearly
done
a
good
job
and
its
not
easy
to
emulate
centuries
of
craftsmanship
and
tradition
o
2
50
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
at
a
german
festival
it
would
make
me
feel
like
i
fit
in
other
than
that
i
am
not
sure
when
i
would
seek
this
out
the
flavors
are
decent
but
it
is
not
really
my
thing
it
is
too
bad
because
i
have
had
mostly
solid
hits
from
jacks
abby
most
jacks
abbey
brews
jump
out
at
you
this
is
a
mild
octoberfest
with
an
amber
to
good
tone
the
head
disappears
quickly
but
the
carbonation
sticks
until
the
bottom
pours
into
a
pokal
a
well
a
copper
color
with
a
minimal
headi
like
a
big
white
crown
on
my
ofest
lager
and
this
didnt
have
much
of
one
at
all
some
caramel
and
bread
dough
in
the
nose
with
a
lighted
note
a
somewhat
mellow
flat
feel
to
the
beer
wich
again
is
off
for
the
style
flavors
of
caramelbread
doughand
a
light
smattering
of
herbal
hops
in
the
finishnot
bad
but
the
feel
doesnt
help
the
flavors
maybe
an
off
bottle
as
far
as
carbonation
goeswould
like
to
try
fresh
from
the
tap
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
overall
smells
good
tastes
very
good
lack
of
head
retention
the
only
flaw
a
beer
for
the
fall
not
brewed
with
pumpkins
nice
malty
flavor
pairs
well
with
cheddar
cheese
overall
pretty
nice
octoberfest
would
have
preferred
more
sweetness
but
im
content
with
it
price
point
212
oz
single
overall
not
my
favorite
marzen
nor
my
favorite
ja
beer
try
if
you
lie
the
style
but
dont
od
too
much
to
seek
it
out
reminiscent
of
firestone
walkers
oaktoberfest
it
has
the
bones
of
a
marzen
but
aspires
to
a
better
form
resulting
from
nuance
very
bright
gold
not
sure
id
qualify
it
as
copper
nice
head
though
importantly
the
basics
have
been
attended
to
malted
munich
dominates
a
sweet
aroma
no
nuttiness
no
pine
just
malt
crisp
and
soft
body
emphasis
on
the
aged
and
thrashed
flavor
of
wheat
smells
much
much
sweeter
than
actual
taste
which
is
given
balance
by
some
noble
hops
herbal
and
medicinal
flavors
o
i
love
this
brew
an
instant
classic
maybe
the
best
oktoberfest
offering
ive
yet
had
one
to
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
or
if
youre
a
skeptic
of
the
style
this
beer
is
bright
vivid
and
reminds
me
of
how
the
fall
leaves
give
off
their
last
bit
of
light
as
color
before
they
turn
brown
and
fall
delicate
swift
on
the
palate
and
has
a
measure
of
sunshine
in
the
drink
imparted
by
the
wheat
o
mellow
easy
drinking
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
i
first
started
drinking
the
superhopped
jacks
abbey
mass
rising
and
hoponius
union
and
figured
they
were
another
brewer
catering
to
the
public
demand
for
super
hopped
ipas
and
ipls
i
have
certainly
been
corrected
ja
puts
out
a
wide
variety
of
lager
style
brews
including
this
fine
offering
cooper
legend
a
road
trip
to
framingham
is
on
the
todo
list
a
really
really
good
american
marzen
it
tastes
more
in
debt
to
millstreams
ofest
than
to
any
traditional
munich
ones
and
while
its
not
as
good
as
its
iowa
counterpart
its
still
probably
the
second
best
american
marzen
ive
ever
had
m
medium
carb
light
body
and
easy
drinking
o
a
great
oktoberfest
certainly
amount
my
favorites
of
the
style
if
not
my
top
one
great
looking
beer
all
the
mild
flavor
of
an
oktoberfest
with
incredible
drinkability
highly
recommended
overall
another
good
product
from
jacks
abby
that
sticks
true
to
the
oktoberfest
style
would
definitely
drink
again
jacks
abby
has
got
it
going
on
fresh
and
flavorful
octoberfest
here
o
really
liking
what
ive
tried
from
these
guys
good
festbier
for
sure
o
a
decent
american
octoberfest
with
a
definite
focus
on
malts
not
really
all
that
complex
but
its
very
drinkable
would
be
a
good
option
at
a
festival
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
slick
the
body
is
excellent
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
it
to
carbonation
is
near
perfect
taste
is
mostly
malt
but
does
has
a
decent
hop
balance
in
the
aftertaste
which
helps
to
smooth
it
out
neither
flavor
is
overwhelming
but
just
the
right
amount
very
easy
drinking
with
a
semidry
finish
that
keeps
you
refreshed
and
coming
back
for
more
ha
on
tap
at
the
corner
bar
in
back
bay
typical
seasonal
beer
oktoberfest
is
everywhere
it
seems
pours
a
great
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
very
malty
and
breast
type
of
smell
and
the
taste
carrys
over
not
hoppy
at
all
pretty
carbonated
beer
and
tasted
artificial
to
me
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
with
this
one
i
like
this
brewery
a
lot
but
this
one
was
just
ok
for
me
very
drinkable
tasty
tostyle
beer
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
in
general
but
i
appreciated
what
they
did
here
particularly
with
the
hoppy
finish
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
and
will
try
anything
they
put
out
at
least
once
would
recommend
this
for
fans
of
hops
that
want
a
seasonal
treat
would
also
recommend
for
those
into
the
style
though
they
might
be
put
off
by
the
interpretation
of
it
overall
easy
drinker
true
to
style
and
wont
disappoint
not
surprised
that
jacks
abby
nailed
this
style
one
of
the
best
american
made
versions
good
malt
character
with
a
nice
complimentary
noble
hop
finish
as
well
as
lager
yeast
good
buttery
toasted
caramel
malt
feel
o
the
first
american
marzen
ive
had
this
year
that
gives
me
hope
still
not
as
good
as
the
germans
make
them
but
not
far
off
and
it
tastes
quite
authentic
overall
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
standout
marzen
would
get
again
if
in
the
mood
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
rich
caramelized
malts
with
lots
of
bready
pilsner
and
subtle
spicy
floral
hops
for
hints
of
balance
the
flavor
is
rich
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
melanoidin
and
hint
of
prunes
and
plum
with
a
light
earthy
spicy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
nice
marzen
not
overly
hoppy
like
some
american
versions
but
rich
and
malty
like
better
german
versions
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
fiery
caramel
color
moving
between
amber
and
red
tones
it
pours
with
a
lovely
head
of
medium
sized
lightly
yellowed
slightly
rocky
bubbles
that
sit
at
a
half
fingers
width
and
slowly
fizzle
away
the
head
leaves
a
negligible
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
lagerclean
but
darker
with
a
lazy
stream
of
bubbles
working
to
the
top
of
the
beer
and
no
particles
present
just
as
there
shouldnt
be
in
this
style
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
spicy
with
a
beautiful
caramel
malt
blanket
on
the
back
of
the
smell
the
caramel
is
layered
and
sweet
gracing
the
nose
with
just
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
and
biscuit
notes
and
the
hops
are
properly
noble
with
a
strong
spice
character
alongside
fresh
cut
grass
notes
the
malt
is
the
bigger
player
in
the
nose
however
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
mellow
with
light
bitters
and
sweetness
which
give
way
to
a
nice
dry
finish
and
only
the
slightest
hint
of
acidity
in
flavor
the
beer
tastes
remarkably
similar
to
several
esbs
ive
had
the
flavor
begins
as
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
apple
juice
this
moves
into
sweet
bread
and
then
quickly
to
stale
bread
and
then
bitter
herbal
hops
with
just
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
from
the
malt
toffee
notes
also
dance
across
the
middle
of
the
palate
the
finish
is
dry
but
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
malt
and
hops
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
softer
carbonation
that
gives
a
quick
bite
and
then
caresses
the
tongue
with
velvet
the
mouth
is
left
dry
except
for
a
very
faint
trail
of
saliva
though
it
is
by
no
means
bonedry
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
its
not
too
sweet
its
not
too
bitter
and
sits
on
the
palate
nicely
with
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
another
sip
but
not
enough
to
fill
you
up
etc
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
and
would
work
very
well
in
an
oktoberfest
environment
nicely
rounded
pleasant
representative
of
the
style
but
a
bit
short
on
malt
and
spice
compared
to
the
original
tastes
clean
fresh
and
dryand
given
the
blend
of
ingredients
likely
to
hold
up
under
moderate
aging
stunning
color
even
for
beers
that
are
normally
copperorangedark
amber
immediately
evoking
the
season
despite
the
fact
thats
its
still
virtually
middle
of
summer
pleasant
sessionable
beer
that
may
win
over
more
than
a
few
crossover
drinkers
although
the
price
is
clearly
a
deterrent
the
4pack
costs
nearly
as
much
as
a
samuel
adams
12pack
would
drink
more
of
it
budget
permittingand
share
with
as
many
people
as
i
can
not
as
heavy
or
as
flavorful
as
some
other
marzen
but
will
do
nicely
for
any
oktoberfest
gathering
o
though
perhaps
lighter
than
some
octoberfests
a
good
one
to
have
while
the
weather
is
still
warm
refreshing
and
quite
tasty
really
hard
to
tell
this
is
close
to
a
year
old
pouring
it
into
the
mug
it
appears
as
an
earthy
orange
with
a
humongous
frothy
head
light
cream
in
color
huge
maltiness
on
the
nose
pie
crust
and
barley
soup
taste
is
reminiscent
of
burnt
crackers
bread
crust
and
porridge
this
is
a
terrific
showcase
of
the
malts
used
its
rich
earthy
and
tastes
of
iron
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
crisp
jacks
abby
knows
lagers
the
depth
is
not
huge
but
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
wonderfully
tied
together
and
makes
for
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
could
have
more
than
one
very
enjoyable
but
not
best
in
class
but
worthy
of
repeating
overall
this
is
a
quite
unremarkable
beer
nothing
particularly
interesting
going
on
here
i
dont
need
anymore
this
was
an
ok
beer
in
my
book
easy
drinker
nothing
super
special
poured
a
deep
goldcoppery
color
nice
head
that
lingered
somewhat
thick
mouthfeel
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
a
little
hoppy
and
a
little
malty
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
very
solid
lager
thanks
to
cbeer88
for
sending
this
one
to
me
appearance
is
a
deep
clear
orange
with
a
razor
thin
layer
white
head
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
some
significant
sweetness
present
notes
of
grapes
grains
and
that
festive
autumn
earthiness
that
is
common
for
the
style
the
taste
delivers
every
bit
of
the
sweetness
that
the
nose
promised
with
notes
of
fruit
and
maple
this
is
countered
by
earthy
grains
and
dry
lager
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mellow
carbonation
overall
this
leans
a
bit
far
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
still
enjoyable
though
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
certainly
far
better
than
standard
anheuserbusch
fare
but
it
does
lack
a
certain
amount
of
punch
and
the
sugars
are
low
enough
that
they
become
easily
lost
under
the
grains
especially
in
subsequent
sips
a
better
sampling
of
orange
berry
and
apricot
notes
would
have
served
this
brew
better
and
helped
to
balance
the
affair
o
straightforward
and
easy
to
drink
another
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
thanks
again
sneezyachew
o
awesome
local
marzen
super
stoked
to
have
access
to
this
for
years
tocome
cheers
d
not
totally
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
oktoberfest
but
a
pleasant
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweeter
flavors
in
this
one
although
i
could
have
stood
for
a
little
bit
crisper
feel
no
problem
drinking
a
halfliter
on
my
own
though
pretty
decent
but
a
little
simple
and
sweet
for
my
tastes
reminds
me
of
alot
of
other
american
oktoberfests
great
malty
mouthfeel
is
a
highlight
despite
the
words
above
i
did
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
there
were
just
little
things
in
almost
every
aspect
that
made
it
average
instead
of
good
overalla
solid
mineraly
tasting
lager
good
for
the
style
and
if
i
want
a
marzen
i
would
look
for
it
however
i
will
probably
not
rush
to
pick
this
one
up
again
taste
starts
worty
and
moderately
sweet
fruity
in
the
middle
and
light
bitterness
through
the
close
body
seems
lacking
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
way
easy
not
bad
but
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
as
well
as
some
of
my
okt
faves
while
i
certainly
appreciate
the
balance
of
this
beer
over
its
often
overly
sweet
or
semimetallic
brethren
the
body
leaves
something
to
be
desired
cheers
very
well
put
together
if
this
was
a
bit
cleaner
it
would
give
its
german
counterparts
a
run
for
their
ofest
ill
be
visiting
this
lager
more
often
than
other
ofests
this
year
notes
begining
to
end
its
so
very
drinkable
cheers
o
im
very
picky
when
it
comes
to
octoberfest
lagers
especially
americanmade
ones
many
brewers
just
use
them
as
a
token
seasonal
offering
and
dont
even
bother
to
stay
true
to
style
they
just
brew
some
crappy
halfbaked
amber
beer
often
using
an
ale
yeast
to
keep
things
more
economical
the
result
is
a
market
flooded
with
a
whole
lot
of
halfassed
octoberfest
beers
lacking
character
and
substance
im
happy
to
report
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
jacks
abby
brews
lagers
exclusively
and
boy
did
they
nail
this
one
copper
legend
has
to
be
the
most
authentic
tasting
americanmade
octoberfest
lager
ive
ever
had
ridiculously
good
and
highly
quaffable
give
me
some
radishes
and
bratwurst
and
im
in
heaven
jacks
abby
so
hot
right
now
o
i
dont
understand
the
less
than
favorable
reviews
this
beer
is
receiving
maybe
there
was
a
bad
batch
maybe
these
people
dont
understand
the
style
or
maybe
there
arent
enough
hops
this
style
is
meant
to
be
maltheavy
i
was
hesitant
to
buy
this
because
of
the
reviews
but
this
again
proves
that
you
must
take
reviews
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
expected
jacks
abby
to
get
this
style
right
of
all
styles
because
after
all
german
beers
are
their
focus
and
they
did
get
it
right
this
is
a
great
beer
and
for
the
style
remember
thats
how
beers
are
supposed
to
be
reviewed
on
this
site
this
gets

a
dense
one
inch
offwhite
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
some
spots
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
light
malts
and
perhaps
a
trace
of
diacetyl
taste
follows
nose
definitely
has
festbier
qualities
in
the
flavor
profile
but
nothing
really
dominates
some
toasted
notes
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
a
little
skunk
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
pleasant
and
consistent
carbonation
overall
quite
drinkable
the
style
in
general
tends
to
become
a
little
too
cloying
for
me
however
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
character
to
it
i
disagree
with
my
peers
on
this
one
jacks
abby
nailed
a
classic
german
lager
style
again
incredibly
easy
to
drink
not
too
filling
and
tons
of
malty
flavor
isnt
that
what
oktoberfest
beers
are
all
about
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
to
light
its
crisp
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
good
carbonation
level
and
insanely
drinkable
the
bottle
goes
before
you
realize
it
probably
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
this
style
jacks
abby
did
a
good
job
again
here
o
like
mostall
oktoberfests
its
a
pretty
simple
brew
dont
let
the
scores
dissuade
you
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
super
smooth
and
drinkable
nice
balance
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
pretty
simple
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
enjoyed
it
great
sessionable
beer
for
the
season
jacks
abby
doesnt
know
how
to
disappoint
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
o
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
for
me
really
had
assumed
jacks
abby
would
make
a
flawless
oktoberfest
far
from
it
i
like
jacks
abby
beers
and
thought
this
would
be
better
than
other
octoberfests
ive
had
but
was
a
little
disappointed
dont
take
this
as
a
downer
this
beer
is
good
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
taste
would
have
rated
this
higher
oda
toptier
up
and
coming
brewery
that
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favs
does
a
marzen
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
this
was
perhaps
the
best
marzen
i
have
had
but
its
still
a
marzen
to
me
jas
worst
brew
so
far
but
still
a
great
depiction
of
a
mediocre
style
o
this
was
a
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
nothing
special
which
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
jacks
abby
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
it
wasnt
something
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
not
too
much
complexity
or
a
ton
of
flavor
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
far
from
terrible
but
far
from
the
best
of
jacks
abby
lagers
update
its
definitely
better
a
little
closer
to
room
temperature
overall
nice
beer
but
not
what
its
supposed
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
good
balance
but
lacks
the
richness
of
the
german
and
most
domestic
octoberfest
brews
overall
eh
a
bit
too
much
cracker
bready
malts
and
toastiness
no
decoction
layered
softness
i
would
have
wanted
a
bit
too
bitter
and
earthy
but
nothing
really
wrong
just
not
what
i
like
in
my
german
oktoberfest
beers
and
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
of
the
top
notch
lagers
from
jacks
abby
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
exactly
anything
that
knocked
my
socks
off
here
maybe
its
just
my
personal
tastes
as
this
beer
is
nicley
rounded
and
very
drinkable
guess
its
just
not
my
thing
my
least
favorite
offering
from
this
new
brewery
so
far
unfortunately
as
a
long
time
fan
of
marzens
ofests
i
cant
help
but
feel
this
beer
was
rushed
will
try
another
time
dokay
style
wise
a
bit
run
of
the
mill
not
bad
but
just
not
anything
to
scream
about
only
available
on
tap
but
worth
seeking
out
in
september
october
and
if
youre
lucky
november
for
bells
this
isnt
all
that
impressive
it
has
a
proper
copper
orange
color
clear
and
holding
an
inch
of
white
suds
for
a
few
minutes
before
settling
aroma
is
sweet
and
rich
autumnal
bigger
in
grain
character
than
most
of
these
sweeter
too
but
seems
alright
minimally
hoppy
in
nose
and
taste
these
could
be
increased
a
little
for
balance
and
depth
toffee
and
lager
yeast
in
the
flavor
long
flavor
too
but
lacking
nuance
because
its
a
little
bolder
than
others
its
hard
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
but
maybe
thats
part
of
its
charm
more
filling
and
hearty
for
later
fall
makes
sense
but
this
is
nowhere
near
as
compelling
as
other
bells
brews
bready
aromas
and
flavors
crystal
clear
orangeish
gold
with
a
2
finger
head
with
good
lacing
on
the
glass
very
rich
malty
flavors
malt
driven
like
an
oktoberfest
good
body
and
carbonation
with
rich
foam
the
malt
balances
well
with
the
bitterness
this
was
a
decent
but
not
great
octoberfest
picked
up
a
growler
poured
into
a
mug
good
color
lighter
orange
light
molasses
marzen
flavor
definite
biscuit
notes
but
a
little
bland
very
mild
white
head
pretty
ok
i
feel
like
bells
products
are
typically
more
solid
than
this
was
what
i
did
get
was
awfully
good
but
it
simply
did
not
assert
itself
as
it
should
oim
afraid
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
bells
but
this
is
just
an
average
attempt
from
an
american
brewer
at
the
german
marzen
many
better
options
out
there
overall
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
favorite
so
far
overall
rather
sweet
and
malty
with
a
great
flavor
profile
and
wonderful
transitions
drinkable
and
quite
favorable
try
this
one
ymmv
but
in
my
parts
marzens
are
a
bit
rare
i
try
every
one
i
see
its
not
world
class
but
bells
had
done
a
decent
job
here
m
wet
and
smooth
flow
good
warming
and
aftertaste
very
drinkable
drinkability
nice
balance
to
this
one
the
firm
flavor
was
quite
welcome
after
the
modest
aroma
this
beer
was
repeatable
easy
to
drink
and
priced
right
three
important
characteristics
for
a
beer
calling
itself
oktoberfest
its
definitely
not
in
the
upper
ranks
of
märzens
more
around
the
middle
id
say
but
for
spending
a
nice
fall
afternoon
watching
baseball
football
or
whatever
your
fall
sports
weakness
is
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
o
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
decent
for
the
style
and
enjoyable
allaround
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
in
all
aspects
im
having
it
a
little
late
since
its
january
and
it
was
bottled
in
august
but
i
think
it
allowed
for
some
of
the
more
complex
flavors
to
kick
in
maybe
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
its
like
not
fresh
then
maybe
thats
how
i
want
it
drink
thanks
erik
for
an
octoberfest
i
wouldve
never
had
before
this
was
pretty
flavorful
with
a
very
odd
aftertaste
i
would
have
this
one
again
next
year
if
i
were
in
mi
for
fall
d
good
drinkability
not
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
not
bad
overall
another
solid
offering
from
bells
o
a
good
marzen
with
nice
elegant
simplicity
not
extremely
complex
but
no
marzens
are
bells
oktoberfest
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
but
it
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
in
any
way
good
but
not
great
average
looking
for
the
style
a
redorange
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
sweet
nutty
caramel
malts
and
grains
solid
the
taste
is
also
good
props
go
out
to
bells
for
a
domestic
oktoberfest
thats
not
too
sweet
instead
it
goes
down
not
tasting
too
much
like
anything
at
first
a
bit
of
graininess
but
not
too
much
else
some
toastiness
comes
in
for
the
finish
too
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
both
about
what
youd
expect
for
the
style
a
bit
more
carbonation
wouldnt
hurt
though
overall
it
could
be
better
but
kicks
the
pants
off
of
most
of
the
domestic
ofests
ive
had
this
year
i
probably
like
the
heavy
seas
marzen
a
bit
more
but
this
is
still
good
this
poured
out
with
a
nice
look
golden
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
that
doesnt
lace
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
nice
aromas
of
grains
and
hints
of
autumn
spice
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
it
had
some
decent
caramel
notes
and
some
decent
autumn
flavors
in
there
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
typical
it
got
to
be
a
little
flat
by
the
end
though
overall
its
not
my
favorite
fest
beer
but
its
not
a
bad
one
to
try
o
a
little
to
be
desired
average
all
around
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
pint
poured
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
floral
subtle
spice
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
floral
spice
wheat
and
grain
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
popped
for
me
in
the
nose
nor
the
flavor
the
flavors
i
did
get
were
blended
quite
nicely
but
this
would
have
been
much
better
with
some
added
complexity
going
on
worth
trying
though
for
the
curious
and
fan
alike
2
there
are
many
better
to
try
out
there
during
an
oktoberfest
party
i
was
able
to
try
the
bells
oktoberfest
the
beer
poured
light
amber
kind
of
hazy
decent
carbonation
that
created
a
thin
white
head
that
laced
the
smell
was
big
on
sweetcaramel
malt
and
some
grain
taste
was
better
than
the
scent
would
lead
the
malt
and
grain
is
prsent
but
there
are
hints
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
good
definite
session
beer
overall
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
marzen
beers
that
i
have
had
certainly
worth
a
try
o
good
beer
not
great
but
a
solid
overall
very
refreshing
good
session
beer
b
a
very
nice
brew
one
you
can
drink
multiple
bottles
of
on
a
crisp
fall
afternoon
good
balance
good
depth
i
picked
this
up
in
secret
halloween
2011
thanks
michael
the
pour
is
light
amber
small
white
head
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
typical
fot
the
style
light
toasted
notes
some
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
toasted
malt
some
bready
sweetness
light
sweet
finish
the
body
is
full
good
carbonation
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
fest
beer
overall
this
aromatic
märzen
is
an
ideal
falltime
quaffer
not
the
craziest
most
robust
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
very
solid
rendition
and
one
that
i
would
purchase
again
recommended
o
crisp
not
bad
in
general
i
like
bells
this
just
isnt
impressing
me
as
much
as
their
beers
normally
do
o
i
havent
found
an
oktoberfest
that
blew
me
away
but
bells
comes
the
closest
i
want
to
take
this
beer
and
sit
on
my
dock
in
maine
and
go
through
a
six
pack
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
its
solid
just
a
normal
beer
that
bells
brewed
pretty
well
notes
soso
marzen
plenty
of
toasted
malt
flavors
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
nice
hints
of
fruit
and
herbal
hops
nothing
too
special
but
a
decent
autumn
beer
o
a
mediocre
octoberfest
and
not
up
to
snuff
with
bells
other
offerings
not
a
bad
option
if
choices
are
lacking
but
theres
much
better
out
there
d
this
beer
drinks
very
nicely
its
delicious
overall
a
let
down
in
terms
of
style
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
sure
but
lacks
taste
wise
i
like
that
the
beer
is
dry
but
i
could
use
more
malt
sweetness
to
give
it
some
depth
im
glad
i
only
picked
up
a
single
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
to
be
had
just
as
easily
i
finished
just
over
half
the
bottle
this
is
a
fairly
average
to
below
average
american
attempt
at
an
oktoberfest
a
bit
disappointed
with
bells
here
wont
be
checking
this
out
again
generally
bland
kind
of
like
an
apwa
of
this
style
good
if
you
wanted
something
simple
unremarkable
and
unmemorable
but
why
bother
why
bother
with
anything
medium
body
well
carbonated
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
drinks
pretty
well
although
nothing
too
explosive
here
o
pretty
good
oktoberfest
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
d
i
think
i
really
like
this
beer
im
not
a
huge
oktoberfest
guy
hoss
is
my
favorite
from
the
states
but
this
might
just
be
my
second
a
six
pack
might
be
in
order
o
bells
octoberfest
is
an
above
average
yet
slightly
forgettable
entry
into
the
märzen
world
nothing
stands
out
here
yet
its
easy
to
drink
without
much
complaint
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
one
of
these
up
yet
if
given
a
choice
id
rather
have
a
victory
festbier
or
great
lakes
ofest
instead
overall
not
bad
surprisingly
not
loaded
with
caramel
and
reddish
malts
which
is
a
nice
change
nice
light
toasty
malts
hops
are
barely
there
and
nice
additions
so
a
bit
more
of
those
would
have
been
better
and
the
other
big
thing
is
the
tons
of
fruit
juice
which
comes
from
the
yeast
probably
fermenting
a
bit
to
hot
and
stressed
but
not
too
bad
d
an
average
oktoberfest
solid
appearance
and
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
a
bit
of
a
let
down
there
are
several
other
style
counterparts
that
i
would
opt
for
and
recommend
over
this
bells
offering
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
marzen
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
pours
a
nice
gold
color
w
an
off
white
one
finger
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
on
the
glass
beer
has
a
little
cloudy
vibe
to
it
nose
is
mostly
toasted
malt
w
a
hint
of
caramel
a
little
thin
and
one
dimensional
for
me
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
a
little
disappointing
feel
is
medium
w
a
little
touch
of
honey
aftertaste
definitely
not
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
this
brewery
but
a
good
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
think
about
what
youre
drinking
this
was
a
good
representation
of
this
style
a
well
balanced
flavorful
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
o
an
average
marzen
certainly
not
disappointed
but
not
too
impressed
either
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
means
but
a
very
sessional
one
very
simple
and
straightforward
taste
that
is
enjoyable
a
lovely
clear
amber
liquid
full
of
carbonation
bubbles
sits
beneath
a
billowing
head
that
stands
tall
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
very
attractive
the
smell
leaves
much
to
be
desired
however
as
the
grain
scents
are
very
weak
the
taste
is
primarily
biscuit
though
hops
make
their
presence
known
with
a
floralherbal
flavor
in
the
finish
nothing
special
going
on
in
the
mouthfeel
though
carbonation
is
just
right
not
one
of
bells
better
brews
o
extremely
drinkable
tasty
great
representation
of
the
style
refreshing
and
flavourful
the
beer
is
nearly
clear
and
appears
light
orange
in
color
the
head
is
thick
and
frothy
measuring
a
little
over
an
inch
thick
the
aroma
is
somewhat
muted
and
weak
though
i
have
yet
to
experience
a
really
assertive
bold
aroma
from
a
beer
of
this
ilk
the
flavor
is
nice
with
a
strong
malt
and
grain
presence
followed
by
a
light
dose
of
pleasant
spices
great
feel
on
the
palate
i
could
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
this
i
would
have
this
again
fuller
bodied
with
a
very
good
spice
and
grain
finish
this
wasnt
a
domestic
oktoberfest
trying
to
masquerade
as
an
oktoberfest
or
trying
to
put
its
own
spin
on
it
takes
the
style
and
runs
with
it
very
well
o
not
a
bad
effort
but
i
could
really
use
more
malt
this
is
a
solid
easy
to
drink
oktoberfest
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
from
bells
though
however
this
sixer
will
become
a
memory
before
too
long
oits
an
ok
octoberfest
but
im
left
with
kind
of
a
meh
feeling
compared
to
great
lakes
or
some
of
the
german
examples
this
one
isnt
all
that
great
medium
copper
color
slightly
hazy
plenty
of
foam
the
aroma
seems
light
with
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
hops
than
the
malt
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
tad
more
malt
noticeable
with
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
hiding
in
the
back
the
body
is
good
and
its
fairly
smooth
clear
copper
color
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
malt
aroma
is
grainy
and
metallic
taste
has
similar
breadygrainy
malts
very
clean
a
hint
of
apple
and
caramel
quite
sweet
minimal
hop
bitterness
although
it
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
mediumlight
bodied
carbonated
and
smooth
definitely
sessionable
not
too
rich
and
mildly
carbonated
leaves
this
oktoberfest
beer
very
quaffible
the
appearance
could
be
cleaned
up
a
bit
for
a
better
presentation
rating
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
much
smoother
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
again
o
a
pretty
awesome
oktoberfest
has
a
really
nice
flavor
so
easy
to
drink
a
supersolid
take
on
the
style
great
full
flavored
traditional
octoberfest
overall
it
is
a
multidimensional
very
flavorful
wellbalanced
beer
o
a
nice
simple
subtly
sweet
oktoberfest
overall
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
the
style
it
was
enjoyable
but
id
rather
try
another
offering
of
this
style
than
give
this
one
another
try
great
feel
and
a
very
easy
drinker
if
you
like
a
sweeter
brew
i
can
have
4
or
so
until
i
have
to
switch
it
up
great
session
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
there
are
several
better
examples
of
the
style
around
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
dthis
is
one
of
my
favorite
stateside
marzens
i
wish
i
could
get
more
than
a
few
months
out
of
the
year
overall
good
beer
that
finishes
a
little
dry
overall
an
okay
octoberfest
but
to
be
honest
id
much
rather
have
a
sa
octoberfest
over
this
one
o
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
wanting
an
overall
good
oktoberfest
m
average
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
much
carbonation
is
pretty
spot
on
just
could
have
a
bit
more
in
the
body
this
beer
is
drinkable
not
much
in
the
way
for
flavors
but
it
is
mildy
malty
with
a
nice
not
dry
finish
it
is
easy
going
the
entire
time
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
they
forgot
the
flavor
o
this
is
a
nice
fall
drinker
picked
this
up
as
a
single
in
a
mix
pack
but
id
be
plenty
happy
to
have
five
more
in
the
fridge
pours
out
an
amber
orange
with
a
one
finger
whitehead
that
quickly
fades
leaving
a
little
retention
sparse
lacing
and
good
carbonation
the
smell
consists
of
caramel
some
bread
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
caramel
apple
some
sugary
sweet
malts
and
than
some
hops
sneak
in
to
balance
the
taste
and
finishes
off
with
some
hops
and
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
dry
and
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
that
ill
try
again
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
thin
and
rather
soft
on
flavor
decent
but
not
great
overall
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
octoberfest
beers
ive
had
ive
never
found
marzens
to
be
particularly
complex
but
this
one
actually
displays
some
nice
complexity
well
done
by
bells
mo
crisp
and
rich
flavor
the
beer
has
a
great
carbonation
overall
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
do
drinkability
is
only
fair
due
to
the
relative
harshness
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
overall
i
am
left
wanting
more
3
0
leaves
the
sweet
flavor
with
a
slightly
astringent
bite
on
the
tongue
pours
a
rich
copper
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
spice
undertones
the
smell
isnt
very
potent
but
very
inviting
the
taste
is
nice
not
as
sweet
as
other
oktoberfests
but
very
enjoyable
the
malt
is
the
focus
and
plays
out
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
nice
carbonation
good
balance
and
depth
to
the
flavor
overall
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
only
a
few
minor
differences
to
set
itself
apart
from
the
rest
but
still
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
an
average
octoberfest
with
an
unfortunate
mineral
flavor
that
lingers
i
love
grabbing
the
first
seasonals
i
see
on
the
shelf
because
i
know
they
are
fresh
this
one
pours
out
a
bright
copper
color
with
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
with
bready
aromas
like
pumpernickel
with
some
faint
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
rich
and
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
nice
herbal
hops
balance
i
detect
some
faint
toffee
flavors
from
the
roasted
malts
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
since
i
favor
hoppier
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
i
am
afraid
that
a
lot
of
the
german
imports
could
be
pasteurized
sure
they
meet
reinheitsgebot
but
what
about
after
they
are
brewed
to
that
point
i
may
never
know
what
a
real
oktobefest
beer
tastes
like
but
i
think
larry
bell
has
put
together
a
very
nice
drinkable
one
prosit
o
absolutely
delicious
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
worried
about
the
lack
of
retention
and
thought
the
taste
would
be
diluted
i
was
wrong
overall
nice
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
that
i
would
drink
again
i
think
the
fact
that
its
underwhelming
in
the
nose
department
really
brings
it
down
part
of
the
experience
is
the
aromatics
and
this
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
however
its
a
good
tasting
beer
that
would
go
well
on
a
fall
day
its
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
d
i
really
expect
more
from
bells
this
is
a
poor
rendition
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
imho
others
in
this
style
notes
for
bells
this
is
middle
of
the
pack
better
than
lager
of
the
lakes
and
third
coast
beer
and
on
par
with
oberon
mouth
feel
and
overall
very
dry
overall
makes
me
thirst
for
water
very
natural
and
leafy
tasting
too
dry
and
carbonated
for
my
likings
m
carbonation
is
bright
and
crisp
very
good
for
the
style
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
d
easy
to
drink
and
characteristic
of
a
good
octoberfest
beer
solid
offering
pale
orange
in
color
it
has
a
caramel
aroma
and
thin
quickly
disappearing
head
but
opens
up
big
and
malty
at
the
first
sip
with
a
full
barley
mouth
feel
and
soft
but
crisp
finishing
hop
upon
the
swallow
this
is
a
beer
lovers
beer
unafraid
to
fill
the
mouth
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
pronounced
grainy
flavor
that
is
proud
uncorrupted
by
roasting
or
other
flavors
although
slightly
overcarbonated
in
the
bottle
its
actually
one
of
the
few
efforts
that
have
reminded
me
of
the
vaterland
i
tried
this
twice
during
the
fall
and
just
not
a
fan
of
it
not
bad
just
others
i
enjoy
much
more
tap
from
various
bars
and
12oz
bottles
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
big
three
finger
off
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
nose
is
yeasty
biscuits
grass
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
sweet
fruit
caramel
malt
and
nuts
with
a
dry
grassy
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
mouth
feel
not
a
favorite
style
but
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
prefer
tap
over
bottle
d
another
very
solid
beer
from
bells
not
the
most
impressive
for
this
style
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
definitely
drink
46
of
these
easy
12
ounce
bottle
pours
clear
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
with
average
retention
and
average
glass
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
pumpkin
and
spices
taste
of
spice
and
pumpkin
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
with
spices
that
linger
afterward
medium
carbonation
and
body
i
was
actually
surprised
on
how
tasty
this
was
considering
the
aromas
tasty
what
a
strange
beer
it
tasted
nothing
like
it
smelled
and
the
taste
was
completely
out
of
style
possibly
the
tap
handle
didnt
match
what
was
in
the
keg
something
definitely
seemed
amiss
here
i
hope
to
try
this
again
sometime
to
see
if
the
experience
is
different
d
this
pretty
good
beer
and
has
some
interesting
things
going
on
but
exemplifying
the
octoberfest
style
is
not
one
of
them
it
has
some
of
the
right
elements
malts
are
toward
the
lighter
end
but
reasonably
rich
and
toasty
with
some
juicy
malt
sweetness
hops
are
noble
if
a
tad
forward
but
what
is
up
with
the
vinous
fruity
ester
bready
yeast
character
what
is
this
a
vienna
kolsch
hybrid
a
kolschfest
it
is
interesting
but
im
not
sure
it
works
bottle
from
champagne
cellars
this
was
spot
on
the
style
but
not
all
that
drinkable
sweet
fast
disapearing
foaming
head
on
copper
fruity
coloured
body
malty
pleasant
aroma
middling
mouthfeel
not
unpleasant
just
not
something
i
could
finish
understated
hops
nobel
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
the
beer
is
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
also
caramel
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
used
to
really
dig
this
style
but
my
palate
is
evolving
toward
bigger
more
flavorful
beers
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
is
just
a
little
plain
for
me
d
this
a
pretty
good
beer
and
similar
to
the
german
ofest
beers
ive
had
id
have
another
3
5
d
this
misses
some
of
the
key
elements
that
i
love
in
marzens
it
tastes
more
like
a
generic
lager
and
is
even
borderline
adjunct
lager
in
its
interpretations
it
could
be
so
much
better
and
is
a
disappointment
coming
from
bells
fantastic
drinkability
rounds
out
what
i
consider
to
be
a
worldclass
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
hits
many
of
the
notes
that
ayinger
and
stoudts
oktoberfests
do
which
puts
it
in
elite
company
for
me
and
away
from
the
big
syrupy
messes
many
american
oktoberfests
end
up
being
not
much
going
on
with
the
aroma
the
beer
carries
a
very
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
no
noticeable
lacing
or
retention
it
displays
a
beautiful
sparkly
orange
gold
color
taste
is
excellent
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bready
lightly
sweet
taste
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
good
carbonation
medium
light
body
overall
it
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
a
pleasure
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
good
but
i
wouldnt
see
myslef
drinking
very
many
of
these
d
okay
drinkability
a
little
too
much
one
sided
d
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
in
the
finish
possibly
due
to
the
low
5
5
abv
this
pours
a
bit
darker
than
a
traditional
lagger
with
little
head
its
definately
a
session
brew
and
id
take
several
of
these
down
at
a
tailgate
the
finish
contains
pronounced
tones
of
malt
and
some
peppery
hop
will
dance
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
nothing
really
great
about
this
beer
one
of
bells
weaker
attempts
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rustic
brown
with
a
minimal
white
head
no
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
thin
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
bread
through
the
nose
on
taste
is
was
expecting
more
of
a
bread
malt
type
taste
but
was
happy
that
this
was
nicely
balanced
this
beer
went
down
very
smoothly
and
i
truly
enjoyed
this
overall
probably
one
of
the
bester
marzen
styles
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
clear
very
deep
gold
with
very
little
slightly
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
pretty
faint
but
theres
some
apple
cider
slight
bready
yeast
and
grainy
sweetness
nice
feel
and
the
finish
is
really
clean
but
the
taste
is
pretty
blah
theres
some
bready
yeast
along
with
a
slightly
metallic
taste
as
well
as
a
faint
hops
note
but
really
theres
just
not
a
lot
of
taste
here
goes
down
like
water
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
did
nothing
to
change
my
opinion
pours
a
light
shade
of
copper
with
a
twofinger
off
white
head
and
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
nose
brings
caramel
bread
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
european
hops
but
is
comprised
mainly
of
a
general
bread
dough
character
with
a
hint
of
grain
feel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
drinks
alright
but
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
them
overall
this
doesnt
hit
me
a
sucha
great
craft
beer
but
its
something
that
can
be
drunk
somewhat
liberally
but
with
a
taste
of
craft
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
its
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
it
was
a
lighter
easy
drinking
beer
but
still
had
some
good
malty
flavors
to
it
it
wasnt
anything
outstanding
but
more
of
a
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
as
well
d
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
very
nicely
on
its
own
or
with
whatever
youre
having
probably
not
something
ill
seek
out
specifically
in
the
future
as
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
the
drink
theres
nothing
that
particularly
stood
out
in
it
either
d
well
a
good
oktoberfest
overall
and
a
great
beer
by
bells
but
i
liked
other
oktoberfests
more
good
beer
overall
d
im
typically
not
crazy
over
oktoberfests
but
i
really
like
this
one
the
mildness
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
it
still
boasts
plenty
of
flavor
i
could
easily
go
through
a
6
pack
drinkability
by
far
the
worst
bells
beer
ive
had
this
was
not
made
for
bas
d
another
good
tasting
brew
from
bells
a
touch
lighter
for
a
marzen
but
still
very
enjoyable
good
seasonal
brew
i
recommend
picking
up
a
6
pack
before
the
season
ends
overall
i
believe
bells
did
a
good
job
on
this
beer
nothing
too
crazy
or
bold
going
on
here
but
its
an
october
fest
and
its
not
meant
to
be
bold
just
tasty
and
drinkable
and
this
beer
succeeds
at
both
having
had
many
bottles
of
this
beer
it
was
nice
to
try
it
on
tap
and
i
thought
i
was
slightly
better
my
go
to
local
octoberfest
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
color
is
pale
goldenorange
typical
of
the
style
what
makes
this
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
octoberfests
is
the
lack
of
cloying
sweetness
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
supple
and
rich
someone
below
said
creamy
and
i
agree
the
carbonation
is
thin
but
not
lacking
sharpness
the
flavor
is
rich
malty
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
honey
this
is
good
stuff
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
with
the
relatively
low
abv
for
the
style
you
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
excellent
effort
from
bells
im
looking
to
try
the
25th
anniversary
beer
but
18
a
six
pack
seems
a
bit
steep
this
one
is
a
fall
seasonal
winner
for
sure
d
i
probably
wont
have
another
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
there
are
a
lot
of
better
choices
out
there
this
isnt
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
d
goes
down
easy
but
it
doesnt
mean
its
good
d
very
nice
maybe
the
best
octoberfest
i
have
had
this
year
bottle
batch
9833
poured
into
a
tupil
glass
appearance
is
a
golden
orange
clear
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
coasters
matly
pumpkin
squash
type
of
aromas
eminating
in
the
nose
oh
eeh
mmm
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
im
sorry
to
report
starts
with
a
little
carbonated
medium
mouthfeel
that
then
develops
into
a
slight
bready
pumpkin
type
flavor
with
some
metallic
notes
the
bitterness
from
the
noble
hops
are
there
but
not
until
the
very
end
and
then
go
on
to
linger
in
the
mouth
some
lace
as
forms
as
i
drink
away
overall
i
think
this
is
just
ok
being
from
mi
i
expedct
a
lot
from
a
hometowm
brew
and
this
one
just
lets
me
down
a
touch
oh
well
most
everything
else
they
do
is
great
bells
is
a
typically
amber
lager
with
a
rich
malty
presence
with
a
slight
tinge
of
hoppiness
near
the
finish
more
complex
than
the
other
octoberfests
ive
reviewed
lately
and
not
as
heavy
on
the
palate
i
rate
this
one
a
prime
example
of
a
traditional
octoberfest
style
and
a
delicious
brew
very
drinkable
another
6
packs
im
glad
i
picked
up
based
on
bells
reputation
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brews
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
youve
come
to
expect
from
a
good
fall
lager
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
some
bread
like
malty
sweetness
balanced
hop
character
and
mild
carbonation
everything
that
reminds
you
fall
is
here
and
the
leaves
are
changing
served
in
the
proper
glassware
this
makes
for
a
wonderful
fall
evening
the
beer
was
a
mild
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
fell
to
a
small
island
over
top
of
the
brew
clarity
was
fantastic
and
a
mild
carbonation
was
present
cascading
towards
the
surface
good
looking
but
maybe
a
touch
light
in
color
aroma
was
grainy
fairly
light
with
a
mild
bready
sweetness
in
the
background
flavor
was
very
bready
with
mild
sweetness
and
toastiness
the
graininess
was
pretty
full
in
there
and
a
mild
bitterness
hit
on
the
finish
i
thought
it
was
tasty
mouthfeel
was
a
solid
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
that
gives
the
brew
the
feel
of
more
thickness
than
it
truly
had
overall
i
liked
the
brew
it
was
a
little
more
grainy
than
i
would
have
liked
and
the
nose
was
lighter
than
expected
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
bells
has
made
a
perfectly
acceptable
octoberfest
but
a
bit
middle
of
the
road
for
my
tastes
i
do
reccomend
trying
this
festbier
however
especially
if
you
like
this
time
of
year
and
the
types
of
beer
that
come
with
it
d
i
really
expect
more
from
bells
this
is
one
of
the
worst
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
had
not
much
flavor
and
the
flavor
that
is
there
really
doesnt
stand
up
to
others
in
this
style
not
as
rich
as
i
normally
like
very
dissapointing
would
not
buy
again
d
easy
to
drink
and
characteristic
of
a
good
octoberfest
beer
solid
offering
cheers
d
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
although
not
one
of
bells
better
offerings
kind
of
plain
moreys
bottom
line
octoberfest
are
not
typically
my
favorite
beers
to
begin
with
although
i
like
to
have
a
few
each
fall
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
especially
coming
from
bells
i
prefer
great
lakes
victory
and
even
sam
adams
octoberfest
to
this
one
not
bad
but
i
dont
see
myself
spending
money
on
it
again
md
goes
down
very
easy
as
most
maerzens
do
i
would
certainly
consider
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
amber
color
under
a
thin
soapy
head
tame
clean
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
somewhat
odd
doughy
note
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
straightforward
in
the
typical
märzen
flavors
toasted
grain
sweet
yet
dry
and
clean
nutty
and
earthy
with
a
bitter
finish
mediumlight
bodied
not
the
most
wellcrafted
oktoberfest
bier
out
there
but
worth
a
try
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
though
poured
from
bottle
into
twenty
two
ounce
beer
glass
pours
typical
amber
orange
color
little
head
that
quickly
dissolved
some
carmel
flavour
but
nothing
special
to
make
me
really
want
more
have
had
other
bells
offerings
that
are
much
better
still
prefer
good
old
sam
adams
or
ayinger
pours
a
clear
copper
that
is
a
shade
or
two
lighter
than
most
oktoberfests
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
aromas
are
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
neither
are
they
consistent
with
boldly
toasty
profile
of
most
members
of
its
style
the
taste
is
also
too
sweet
with
mostly
notes
of
honey
and
sugar
to
fit
the
bill
i
typically
like
bells
offerings
but
this
one
lacks
malty
depth
that
draws
me
to
the
style
in
the
first
place
pass
d
very
drinkable
crisp
like
the
fall
weather
not
a
great
beer
but
the
first
octoberfestoktoberfest
of
the
year
so
i
was
pleased
i
have
had
two
other
octoberfests
this
year
the
hackerpschorr
tasted
like
lager
with
some
extra
hops
sprinkled
in
while
the
leinies
was
somewhat
similar
to
bells
but
with
some
off
flavors
bells
is
best
so
far
d
this
is
an
alright
octoberfest
nothing
special
but
this
beer
is
plenty
drinkable
severely
disappointed
pretty
plain
jane
and
middleoftheroad
for
a
bells
offering
o
k
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
shout
out
about
here
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
refreshing
oktoberfest
easy
drinking
and
light
on
the
palate
i
would
see
this
ranking
higher
if
overall
taste
was
a
bit
more
bold
d
nothing
really
outstanding
from
the
beer
like
the
bit
of
hop
at
the
end
in
the
taste
will
stick
to
germany
for
my
oktoberfest
dgood
i
could
drink
a
few
drinkability
im
typically
not
a
big
consumer
of
oktoberfest
style
beers
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
possibly
because
its
less
sweet
with
more
hop
i
did
have
three
last
night
and
was
ready
for
more
d
ehhhh
i
guess
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
it
really
was
quite
boring
its
gettin
to
be
that
time
o
year
again
when
ofests
run
the
world
this
one
pours
a
lightly
hazed
orange
amber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
seemingly
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
apple
cinnamon
caramel
cashews
nutmeg
and
a
touch
o
citrusy
hops
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
peel
caramelized
caramel
okay
ive
been
advised
by
vdubb
that
itd
be
better
to
call
it
burnt
caramel
either
way
you
get
the
picture
red
apple
skin
oak
and
a
slight
bit
o
lime
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
ofest
not
one
of
the
heavier
hitters
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
d
this
is
my
first
fall
seasonal
of
the
year
and
it
didnt
disappoint
overall
this
is
a
solid
ofest
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
had
a
glass
ontap
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
the
clear
amber
lager
looked
nice
enough
but
there
was
an
odd
floral
and
plastic
twist
to
the
caramel
malts
i
just
couldnt
get
into
yes
there
was
the
light
bread
and
caramel
character
but
it
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
like
it
should
the
body
is
drinkable
but
the
flavor
isnt
i
thought
that
this
one
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
my
qualms
are
minimal
better
head
retention
maybe
a
tad
less
bitterness
and
some
more
hop
in
the
aroma
the
hoppy
aroma
is
my
american
opinion
so
dont
yell
at
me
d
i
really
do
like
this
it
is
probably
my
favorite
american
octoberfest
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
oktoberfest
isnt
a
complex
style
to
begin
with
but
bells
has
made
a
mostly
drinkable
version
of
it
tried
this
side
by
side
with
the
great
lakes
oktoberfest
and
this
was
a
big
letdown
while
the
gl
was
a
fairly
faithful
if
boring
representation
of
the
style
im
not
sure
what
the
aim
was
with
this
appearance
was
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
quickly
fading
foamy
off
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
had
the
typical
toasted
malt
notes
but
very
little
caramel
or
hops
or
basically
any
depth
at
all
flavor
was
also
lacking
malt
depth
and
was
oddly
tangy
and
sweet
and
overly
carbonated
for
the
style
bread
and
toasted
malts
dominate
with
some
occasional
strong
grain
presence
as
well
and
the
finish
has
some
earthy
hops
and
grains
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
with
strong
fine
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
missing
a
lot
for
the
style
and
particularly
woeful
when
compared
to
the
great
lakes
version
d
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
another
good
offering
from
bells
nowhere
near
my
favorite
of
theirs
but
still
a
good
beer
would
possibly
order
one
if
they
were
serving
it
at
the
cafe
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
dry
drinkability
is
fine
its
a
good
oktoberfest
but
not
one
of
the
best
pours
a
nice
light
clear
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
eventually
laces
on
top
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
not
much
more
i
think
i
was
able
to
pick
out
the
scent
of
a
bit
of
citrus
from
the
hops
as
well
as
honey
the
taste
is
quite
malty
as
an
oktoberfest
should
be
there
is
a
definite
undercurrent
of
noble
hops
which
give
it
quite
a
traditional
german
oktoberfest
flavor
i
might
be
biased
but
i
tend
to
go
for
the
sweeter
american
style
personal
preference
say
what
you
will
the
slight
taste
of
citrus
from
the
hops
eventually
builds
upon
the
tongue
to
almost
be
acidic
to
the
point
where
it
might
be
mistaken
for
bitterness
in
the
beer
this
creates
a
rather
earthy
oktoberfest
as
it
should
be
this
beer
is
extraordinarily
smooth
and
appropriately
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
definite
recommendation
of
a
german
style
oktoberfest
prost
d
good
example
of
the
style
if
this
is
your
thing
you
will
enjoy
md
medium
body
very
delightful
feel
it
does
dry
your
mouth
out
a
bit
though
i
think
the
drinkability
is
great
like
i
said
above
its
my
favorite
so
far
this
year
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
the
aroma
is
exceptionally
clean
with
hay
and
biscuit
notes
upfront
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
and
some
floral
hops
the
flavor
starts
off
with
toasted
bread
caramel
toffee
musty
hay
floral
and
tealike
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
and
arguably
the
best
american
interpretation
along
with
victorys
drinkabilityl
an
easy
drinker
and
definitely
right
for
the
fall
but
this
isnt
necessarily
the
best
of
its
style
d
well
i
cant
fight
it
the
weather
is
changing
and
the
octoberfest
and
pumpkin
beers
are
on
their
way
this
beer
is
a
good
introduction
to
a
season
of
new
beers
edit
after
finishing
the
6pack
three
of
the
beers
had
that
awful
smell
while
three
were
actually
mellow
and
crisp
smelling
so
im
not
sure
what
is
going
on
with
that
i
am
a
huge
bells
fan
and
love
most
of
their
beers
but
i
think
this
needed
a
little
more
darkness
and
malt
to
nail
the
style
the
dogtoberfest
i
had
a
few
days
ago
was
much
more
satisfying
this
is
good
and
drinkable
though
just
throw
the
bottle
away
after
you
pour
and
forget
its
supposed
to
be
an
octoberfest
drinkability
is
good
and
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
drinking
2
german
oktoberfest
failures
d
the
only
thing
that
would
make
this
easier
to
drink
is
better
taste
d
so
far
great
lakes
leads
the
octoberfest
pack
sorry
bells
the
appearance
is
quite
striking
a
very
translucent
gold
starts
at
the
bottom
and
works
up
into
a
deep
golden
rose
with
ruby
interior
petals
the
smell
is
bittersweet
marzen
malts
and
very
light
other
than
that
the
taste
has
that
very
good
very
smooth
toasted
amber
malt
quality
frequent
of
good
oktoberfests
for
the
first
half
and
then
a
very
good
hop
balance
comes
into
play
to
finish
it
off
the
beer
does
have
a
decent
body
to
it
and
though
the
hops
and
5
5
are
great
but
nothing
to
trifle
with
the
drinkability
is
above
average
d
the
only
reason
i
keep
sipping
on
this
is
because
of
the
flavor
than
the
smell
if
i
want
pumpkin
ill
get
pumpkin
ale
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
very
impressive
bit
still
a
good
solid
beer
i
can
imagine
this
with
warm
doughnuts
from
the
cider
mill
dthis
is
only
an
average
beer
for
this
style
somewhat
of
a
dissapointment
for
this
brewery
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
to
be
an
octoberfest
beer
however
mouthfeel
is
nice
good
medium
body
and
really
active
but
not
prickly
carb
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
nice
for
the
style
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
im
pretty
sure
i
could
homebrew
this
quality
of
beer
with
a
little
more
practice
i
guess
i
just
expect
a
bit
more
from
bells
and
this
is
just
remarkable
remarkably
average
that
it
although
i
am
now
follower
of
the
bells
beer
consumer
cult
i
must
admit
this
is
a
good
beer
perhaps
not
great
but
certainly
drinkable
this
one
was
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
light
and
kind
of
watery
with
the
lightest
of
heads
it
was
a
light
light
orange
that
was
very
translucent
the
smell
was
strange
it
had
both
yeasty
and
lunchmeat
aromas
yes
lunchmeat
i
have
no
idea
why
it
smelled
like
that
considering
its
very
very
fresh
the
taste
was
bland
and
also
had
a
slint
tint
of
lunchmeat
to
it
whats
happening
at
least
it
was
fresh
and
crisp
but
it
was
a
little
light
i
dont
know
where
bells
went
wrong
on
this
one
i
didnt
think
it
was
awful
last
year
but
this
bottle
was
horrible
not
drinkable
whatsoever
drinkability
a
clean
beer
but
not
as
flavorful
as
it
could
be
a
solid
concoction
worth
drinking
in
october
d
average
octoberfest
a
bit
too
syrupy
for
me
one
and
done
i
love
bells
products
but
not
crazy
about
this
one
i
was
expecting
more
from
bells
on
this
one
will
just
have
to
switch
back
to
their
other
offerings
dlighter
beer
that
has
an
ok
taste
and
decent
mouthfeel
not
one
of
their
better
beers
but
it
alright
d
admittedly
i
didnt
like
the
first
couple
of
bottles
from
the
original
6pack
when
i
first
picked
it
up
a
few
months
ago
maybe
a
little
age
was
good
for
this
or
my
tastes
are
more
in
tune
to
the
style
i
was
drinking
a
lot
of
imperial
ipas
at
that
time
but
this
beer
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
i
remember
it
not
a
world
class
brew
and
certainly
not
the
best
bells
has
to
offer
but
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
when
you
want
something
easy
to
drink
and
not
overwhelming
in
any
one
flavor
category
d
drinkability
is
good
with
this
beer
not
my
favorite
style
by
far
but
bells
makes
it
enjoyable
will
look
for
next
year
when
its
fresh
d
this
is
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
or
something
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
friends
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
if
i
were
looking
to
explore
the
depths
of
palate
but
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
a
really
good
aftertaste
where
a
bit
of
honey
poured
a
light
amber
color
in
the
glass
with
hints
of
gold
along
the
sides
strong
visual
of
carbonation
that
forms
a
white
half
inch
high
head
on
top
that
gradually
settles
to
a
thin
layer
cracked
grain
and
bread
strikes
the
nose
at
first
scent
with
a
touch
of
grass
and
peppery
fragrances
come
out
at
the
end
the
bread
comes
out
in
the
flavor
by
attaching
itself
to
the
palate
that
flavor
stays
there
and
lingers
long
after
each
taste
there
is
a
feint
bit
of
bitterness
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
with
grassy
and
grapefruit
flavors
the
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
thinning
to
a
more
watery
consistency
an
ever
present
feel
carbonation
is
there
from
front
to
back
this
is
an
average
octoberfest
the
color
is
to
golden
the
aroma
is
not
hearty
enough
the
flavor
is
not
robust
and
the
feel
does
not
have
that
crispness
i
look
for
in
the
style
of
course
i
could
be
wrong
very
drinkable
but
not
too
special
rather
decent
brew
nice
hops
and
good
flavor
very
drinkable
d
highly
drinkable
id
order
another
and
wouldnt
object
to
buying
a
sixer
despite
the
off
metallic
character
i
havent
had
too
many
beers
in
this
style
enjoyable
as
a
good
anytime
beer
drinkability
a
solid
oktoberfest
and
another
tasty
brew
from
bells
refreshing
with
a
nice
body
and
crisp
feel
a
brew
i
will
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
aroma
was
downright
bad
ive
gone
through
a
6
pack
and
keep
getting
this
same
nasty
salty
vegetable
smell
past
experiences
with
this
beer
didnt
leave
me
with
high
expectations
but
again
i
gave
into
the
pull
of
octoberfest
its
drinkable
but
falls
short
of
the
typical
bells
quality
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
slight
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
dry
hop
hint
of
spice
and
slight
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
marzenoktoberfest
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
grain
hint
of
citrus
pale
malt
hint
of
butter
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
overall
a
decent
blend
body
and
appearance
o
ok
beer
but
a
great
alternative
to
macrobrew
lager
this
review
was
missing
after
a
server
crash
added
back
on
1028
pours
a
bright
orange
color
tone
isnt
quite
as
deep
as
i
like
to
see
in
a
marzen
but
pretty
nonetheless
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
originate
from
the
base
of
the
pour
and
a
bubbly
12
finger
head
fizzes
to
nothing
quickly
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
taste
is
full
of
malts
and
seasonal
spices
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
taste
makes
up
for
the
lack
in
appearance
overall
a
good
marzen
from
bells
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
bright
amber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
caps
the
beer
and
lasts
aroma
is
a
light
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
toasted
sweet
malt
flavors
with
a
low
bitterness
in
the
finish
an
a
hint
of
honey
flavor
overall
a
terrific
take
on
the
marzen
style
d
a
decent
mildly
flavored
mass
market
oktoberfest
beer
a
little
on
the
malty
side
but
with
a
nice
light
hop
bitterness
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
autumn
beer
d
a
solid
oktoberfest
that
definitely
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
in
a
good
way
definitely
much
hoppier
than
usual
for
an
oktoberfest
but
its
good
though
still
really
malty
and
filling
than
i
would
want
though
overall
this
is
one
of
bells
beers
that
just
didnt
impress
me
it
is
better
than
some
octoberfests
but
i
expected
more
flavor
considering
it
was
brewed
by
bells
probably
not
something
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
of
ive
only
seen
this
beer
on
tap
in
pa
never
bottles
im
pretty
sure
larry
bell
wont
send
any
of
his
lagers
to
pa
in
bottles
why
i
have
no
idea
anyway
arrived
in
a
standard
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazed
apricot
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
rust
colored
head
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
biscuit
malt
sweet
caramel
slightly
fruity
somewhat
spicy
yeast
some
peppery
hops
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
not
really
something
i
thought
about
the
next
day
i
can
usually
expect
some
decent
and
reliable
results
from
bells
but
i
think
i
was
turned
off
by
the
smell
spicier
and
more
herby
than
most
other
octoberfests
good
amber
color
and
medium
head
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
a
little
too
spicy
and
bitter
for
an
octoberfest
mainly
because
i
think
lagers
shouldnt
have
these
characteristics
d
not
the
best
octoberfest
brew
but
another
tasty
offering
by
bells
d
the
flavor
is
nice
but
it
lacks
sweetness
and
its
too
crisp
and
hoppy
compared
to
my
favorite
octoberfest
beers
not
bad
but
nothing
that
id
seek
out
again
poured
to
a
two
fingered
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
head
was
offwhite
in
color
brew
itsself
was
clear
and
very
golden
had
some
lacing
but
not
a
lot
smelled
a
little
sweetlike
caramel
with
biscuits
and
malt
tasted
slightly
sweet
also
of
caramel
and
malt
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
this
wasnt
a
bad
thing
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
about
right
i
will
have
a
sixer
of
these
every
october
wouldnt
want
to
make
a
session
beer
out
of
them
d
drikable
not
a
superseet
malty
beer
like
some
other
octoberfests
a
well
balanced
beer
good
octoberfest
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
dark
golden
with
very
little
head
smells
malty
but
with
a
larger
hop
presence
than
is
usual
for
the
style
not
unpleasant
but
a
little
different
the
taste
could
have
some
more
robust
maltiness
but
its
not
flabby
at
all
with
a
clean
firm
edge
to
it
from
the
hops
a
little
light
and
a
bit
nutty
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
to
start
but
i
got
a
little
tired
of
it
by
the
time
i
was
finished
not
bad
but
a
little
too
far
out
of
the
style
guidelines
to
work
its
too
soft
for
a
hoppier
beer
and
too
hoppy
for
a
marzen
okay
a
light
brownishorange
color
with
a
decent
white
head
to
start
but
not
much
lace
in
the
long
run
the
aroma
is
mostly
hops
and
while
its
not
bad
its
not
quite
great
could
have
used
more
malt
same
goes
with
the
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
its
blended
a
lot
better
and
the
malt
steps
forward
a
little
bit
more
good
carbonation
and
wellintegrated
bitterness
makes
this
one
particularly
refreshing
one
of
the
better
octobers
ive
had
this
year
and
another
solid
effort
from
bells
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
definitely
an
american
bastardization
of
the
style
it
could
stand
a
more
complex
malt
body
and
some
toning
down
of
the
hops
for
someone
who
prefers
a
hoppier
beer
it
could
be
just
right
otherwise
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
feel
like
i
have
to
shave
off
half
a
point
for
style
guidelines
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
that
is
almost
copper
with
a
decent
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
and
just
a
little
spicy
mouthfilling
malty
flavor
has
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
cloves
rich
lively
texture
leaves
a
nice
spicy
finish
this
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
but
there
are
far
too
many
other
bells
offerings
that
i
would
take
over
this
one
hey
how
can
you
not
enjoy
a
little
sweet
yeasty
aroma
with
a
freaking
match
in
his
mouth
and
a
wearing
a
pair
of
aviators
spouting
lines
like
youre
a
disease
and
im
the
cure
also
i
love
how
people
rip
on
how
overthetop
and
phony
american
octoberfest
beers
are
with
all
the
toasted
malt
and
honey
flavor
and
the
onemangang
takedowns
of
entire
armies
composed
of
the
same
five
guys
getting
killed
in
different
fashions
what
makes
me
laugh
is
that
todays
fall
beers
are
no
more
smooth
and
drinkable
have
you
seen
anything
with
pumpkin
in
it
drinking
these
beers
too
much
could
make
anyone
believe
in
the
freaking
easter
bunny
anyway
if
you
havent
tasted
bells
octoberfest
please
check
it
out
not
one
of
the
better
efforts
as
far
as
an
oktoberfest
goes
but
it
is
ok
drinkabiliys
moderae
to
low
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
but
it
falls
flat
s
soon
as
it
hits
the
tongue
it
loked
and
smeled
like
a
good
ofest
but
the
taste
just
wasnt
quite
there
for
me
d
easily
drinkable
with
a
nice
flavor
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
medium
amber
color
translucent
and
fizzy
smell
is
sweet
caramel
and
sugars
taste
is
very
sweet
as
well
lots
of
breadiness
to
this
one
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
pretty
light
bodied
without
any
overwhelming
characteristics
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
fall
beer
overall
an
interesting
marzen
i
gotta
give
it
props
for
having
a
load
of
flavor
which
is
something
that
seems
to
be
lacking
in
the
style
however
the
flavor
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
my
taste
when
drinking
a
traditional
oktoberfest
this
may
not
be
the
most
tostyle
octoberfest
out
there
but
who
cares
its
damn
good
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
one
bells
rarely
disappoints
this
is
the
best
octoberfest
ive
had
so
far
this
seasoni
know
its
early
pours
a
glowing
orange
amber
with
a
rich
frothy
head
perfect
carbonation
the
taste
has
the
right
amount
of
malt
with
subtle
peppery
spice
i
had
this
just
after
a
leinenkugel
octoberfest
and
bells
was
far
superior
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
d
i
expected
more
from
bells
its
probably
one
of
their
weaker
beers
but
still
a
solid
offering
the
grassy
hops
are
killing
me
here
but
its
a
great
fall
beer
nonetheless
not
something
id
rush
out
for
again
but
good
either
way
d
an
extremely
sessionable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
of
2009
an
excellent
oktoberfest
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
introduction
to
fall
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
beer
could
have
a
lot
more
oompf
than
it
has
but
it
is
a
decent
offering
so
to
sum
bells
octoberfest
is
just
shy
of
being
superb
and
its
a
crime
the
score
on
this
site
is
so
low
i
rate
fairly
and
my
ratings
are
correct
eat
your
heart
out
joe
bells
octoberfest
beer
pours
a
clear
copperygolden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
slightly
toasted
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
it
flavors
are
also
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
very
refreshing
with
light
carbonation
the
hops
are
there
but
very
subtle
and
understated
perhaps
too
much
so
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
outstanding
it
goes
well
with
a
steamy
florida
summer
night
we
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
bells
it
is
a
lovely
orange
super
clear
beer
with
a
white
head
if
i
had
one
serious
quibble
with
the
beer
its
the
aroma
oktoberfest
lagers
are
supposed
to
be
fairly
clean
with
no
hint
of
esters
or
diacetyl
and
unfortunately
this
one
had
a
very
powerful
ester
aroma
that
was
not
appropriate
for
the
style
i
also
felt
it
was
hopped
to
have
a
noticeable
hop
taste
which
isnt
appropriate
for
the
style
its
a
good
beer
but
i
didnt
feel
it
was
a
good
oktoberfest
otherwise
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
and
definitely
had
a
lot
of
merit
on
its
own
quality
stuff
recommended
seriously
a
b
average
this
is
handsdown
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
rather
than
coat
my
mouth
with
candylike
caramel
flavors
bells
has
gone
a
more
traditional
route
and
focused
on
the
toasty
flavors
d
high
on
the
list
of
beers
i
could
do
in
a
session
this
fall
but
the
lack
of
a
stable
aftertaste
will
keep
me
away
on
tap
at
pracna
on
main
for
their
oktoberfest
flights
had
this
along
with
10
other
oktoberfest
beers
and
i
felt
this
one
was
in
the
top
five
of
all
of
them
may
not
say
much
but
i
enjoyed
it
typical
burnt
orange
color
for
this
style
minimal
head
and
lace
subtle
smell
of
malt
sweet
malt
taste
with
some
caramel
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
not
great
but
still
enjoyable
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
a
decent
offering
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
in
the
bottle
it
is
very
drinkable
but
it
is
rather
boring
i
really
like
bells
beers
and
the
ofest
style
but
his
combination
left
me
a
little
deflated
i
really
had
expected
more
from
this
one
a
rare
miss
from
bells
in
my
opinion
i
was
a
bit
let
down
with
this
i
hate
knocking
a
beer
and
i
love
bells
but
there
was
nothing
dominant
about
this
nothing
really
stood
out
im
pretty
sure
this
is
rather
fresh
as
we
just
started
getting
their
oktoberfest
this
year
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
even
within
the
style
this
is
not
the
best
beer
i
expected
more
from
bells
a
brewery
that
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
not
their
finest
offering
thats
for
sure
the
mouth
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
but
theres
some
touches
of
carbonation
bite
in
and
out
flavors
of
fresh
bread
grassy
hops
and
light
spices
make
up
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
decent
festbier
id
have
it
again
drinkability
tis
the
season
a
pleasant
easily
drinkable
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
this
isnt
a
märzen
and
this
isnt
a
pumpkin
ale
so
why
does
bells
label
this
as
an
oktoberfest
beer
when
it
comes
to
seasonal
beers
especially
oktoberfest
i
expect
something
other
than
the
standard
fair
of
beer
if
this
is
what
bells
considers
oktoberfest
then
i
must
say
its
a
muted
almost
unreasonable
beer
i
suppose
i
cant
really
say
its
a
letdown
as
from
previous
experience
with
bells
i
havent
found
a
single
style
that
they
excel
at
this
is
just
another
beer
that
i
feel
is
a
result
of
the
craft
beer
explosion
in
which
hype
matters
more
than
product
overall
this
was
a
lackluster
attempt
at
the
style
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
usually
miss
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
the
flavors
dont
pop
enough
and
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
body
poured
a
nice
light
copper
color
not
as
deep
as
i
like
but
with
a
little
bit
of
head
no
lacing
nice
scent
malty
with
a
nice
hint
of
leaves
but
again
not
as
deep
as
id
like
good
flavor
nice
malt
deepness
a
slight
burnished
flavor
to
it
goes
down
quite
well
drink
i
could
have
a
lot
of
these
it
isnt
a
real
strong
tasting
beer
but
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
is
very
smooth
i
liked
it
a
lot
d
a
really
nice
oktoberfest
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
these
really
easily
drinkability
pretty
high
not
my
favorite
marzen
in
the
group
so
far
but
definitely
tasty
and
a
little
unique
amongst
the
rest
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
body
to
this
beer
seems
a
tad
watery
on
the
tongue
and
a
touch
flat
overall
not
a
great
representation
of
this
style
at
least
not
compared
to
other
oktoberfests
that
i
have
consumed
very
rarely
does
bells
let
me
down
this
is
one
of
those
times
i
dont
know
which
beer
they
were
describing
in
the
commercial
description
but
its
not
this
one
i
personally
prefer
the
old
redvienna
malt
lagers
of
the
traditional
okfestmarzens
this
one
is
a
lighter
amber
tending
yellow
does
have
a
nice
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
good
malty
aroma
ditto
flavor
nice
body
good
finish
but
nothing
exceptional
ok
fest
beer
for
this
year
i
guess
session
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
threadbare
skin
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
not
much
taste
at
first
45
degree
but
got
a
malty
sweetness
and
nutty
as
it
warmed
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
great
for
those
frosty
oktober
evenings
in
württemberg
or
wherever
tasty
when
it
warms
otherwise
average
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
figured
i
would
support
my
state
by
buying
bells
octobefest
appearance
is
standard
for
the
style
nose
does
not
produce
anything
even
remotely
interesting
a
bit
of
mettalic
hops
taste
on
the
finish
medium
malt
backbone
and
a
thin
mouthfell
round
out
a
dissapointing
beer
form
a
brewery
that
normally
nails
it
a
very
well
made
flavorful
example
of
an
octoberfest
i
would
definately
pick
this
up
over
a
lot
of
others
drinkability
its
a
fine
beer
but
the
taste
is
the
strong
point
to
it
as
the
other
aspects
dont
really
measure
up
overall
and
it
falls
a
tad
short
the
abv
is
mild
enough
and
its
certainly
refreshing
so
i
could
easily
get
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
if
necessary
not
light
but
not
quite
medium
bodied
either
carbonation
is
on
par
wouldnt
turn
this
down
on
a
fall
day
but
hopefully
i
find
some
better
representations
of
the
style
expect
better
from
bells
drinkability
is
decent
not
the
best
marzen
and
a
bit
stale
on
the
palate
could
be
better
but
still
not
a
bad
brew
d
decent
beer
from
bells
expected
much
more
d
this
is
a
nice
octoberfest
yet
another
worthy
brew
from
bells
clear
amber
minimal
offwhite
head
aroma
is
nutty
caramelly
malts
with
some
grassy
and
spicy
notes
underneath
light
to
medium
bready
malt
sweetness
is
not
quite
cleared
out
by
the
underlying
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
in
body
smooth
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
maybe
very
drinkable
at
this
abv
a
decent
representation
of
the
american
style
ofest
drinkability
decent
somewhat
sweet
lager
but
a
fairly
weak
example
of
a
marzen
cmon
larry
you
can
do
better
bells
octoberfest
is
a
clear
gollden
bodied
beer
with
a
two
finger
thick
khaki
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aromas
are
malty
sweet
and
bready
the
flavor
matches
with
a
decent
bittering
to
acheive
balance
and
drinkability
notes
of
caramel
coated
fresh
baked
bread
come
with
warming
creamy
mouthfeel
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
being
sticky
a
great
beer
for
a
cool
fall
day
overall
this
is
my
favorite
americanmade
oktoberfest
bier
i
was
turned
onto
bells
about
1
5
years
ago
and
have
not
been
disappointed
in
anything
so
far
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
many
of
these
prosit
a
nicely
balanced
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
light
and
fruity
flavors
with
some
very
subtle
malt
elements
an
interesting
raisiny
sweetness
is
detectable
from
the
confluence
of
malt
and
hop
the
finish
is
not
good
and
the
brew
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
too
much
so
actually
as
there
is
little
lingering
of
the
flavors
which
are
decent
to
be
fair
but
the
whole
beast
is
too
anemic
for
me
to
make
a
good
autumn
lager
ultimately
the
experience
fades
unceremoniously
certainly
the
driest
oktoberfest
i
have
sampled
to
date
really
plain
beer
im
a
little
surprised
from
bells
they
usuallly
produce
d
good
dirinkablity
however
this
seems
more
like
a
summer
refresher
rather
than
a
rich
full
bodied
fall
oktoberfest
d
refreshing
maybe
good
for
a
hot
october
but
not
for
me
not
the
biggest
on
this
style
but
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
terrible
but
far
from
awesome
d
awesome
super
delicious
beer
i
dont
know
why
it
isnt
higher
rated
impressed
me
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
by
far
not
my
favorite
octoberfest
i
have
had
this
season
was
in
my
local
beer
store
today
and
bells
octoberfest
was
on
the
shelf
i
bought
a
single
and
was
glad
i
only
purchased
1
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
off
orange
color
with
the
typical
big
head
that
bell
brews
has
the
smell
was
ok
it
was
stale
and
musty
smelling
the
taste
was
malty
with
spice
and
hops
im
not
impressed
at
all
its
ok
will
not
buy
again
bells
needs
to
rework
this
marzen
its
just
not
good
year
after
year
i
also
think
bells
has
become
to
big
and
expanded
to
to
many
states
and
has
become
a
macromicro
brewery
and
has
lost
some
of
their
small
batch
quality
not
drinking
to
much
of
their
brews
like
i
used
to
overall
ive
been
kinda
disappointed
with
bells
lately
this
years
batch
of
octoberfest
is
definitely
better
then
last
years
i
noticed
theyve
been
changing
it
over
the
years
last
year
it
was
5abv
and
was
terrible
then
the
year
before
that
07
was
around
high
5s
abv
and
was
amazing
im
not
saying
higher
the
abv
the
better
but
for
this
case
it
is
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
will
pick
up
again
d
drinkability
is
good
but
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
to
style
is
a
little
too
hoppy
albeit
very
nice
noble
hop
character
it
seems
to
be
a
typical
american
micro
take
on
the
style
id
have
preferred
more
munich
malt
with
a
sweeter
character
but
the
freshness
of
this
beer
stands
tall
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
but
with
a
catch
i
do
not
feel
this
is
a
good
session
beer
its
good
to
have
one
maybe
two
and
then
move
on
this
is
a
good
beer
in
small
quantities
pours
a
very
light
brownyellowish
color
smells
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
doesnt
have
much
of
a
hoppy
taste
at
all
it
goes
down
very
smooth
the
first
half
of
my
glass
tasted
watered
down
but
it
filled
out
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
pours
a
golden
amber
in
color
ring
of
head
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
malts
in
the
nose
as
well
as
what
smells
like
some
sort
of
corn
base
taste
is
huge
on
the
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
some
signs
of
toffee
easy
drinking
and
slightly
unimpressive
looking
forward
to
trying
the
brew
fresh
when
it
comes
around
again
d
easy
drinking
solid
ofest
a
pretty
orangish
pourwith
a
thin
head
aromaof
sweet
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
was
butterytoffeesome
faint
hopsand
spices
wellbalanced
with
a
thin
bodyvery
drinkable
not
as
good
as
i
expected
but
still
a
solid
offering
that
was
on
12222008
on
the
new
batch
2010
this
beer
has
gotten
far
worse
the
aroma
is
of
cracker
malt
and
almost
an
adjunct
note
much
like
the
nose
of
a
yuengling
or
coors
original
but
with
a
little
more
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
outhouse
flavour
is
not
better
tastes
adjunctish
with
stale
crackers
and
stale
hops
this
is
just
bad
drain
pour
come
on
bells
d
definitely
sessionable
though
i
think
i
prefer
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
overall
a
bit
more
orange
pour
quite
fluffy
whitish
head
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
one
but
not
overly
offensive
standard
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
lightmed
bodied
with
some
biscuitbreadiness
hopping
cuts
down
the
sweetness
pretty
well
id
say
this
is
sessionable
if
not
quite
drinkable
one
of
the
very
few
octoberfests
i
cared
for
this
year
worth
trying
a
slightly
above
average
take
on
the
style
d
ok
will
i
seek
this
out
again
no
not
because
it
wasnt
good
but
because
it
is
not
my
preferred
style
nice
lower
alcohol
content
wish
i
liked
it
overall
this
is
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
and
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
an
okto
i
would
revisit
as
oktoberfest
should
really
be
a
sessionable
beer
and
this
one
i
find
to
be
just
a
bit
too
odd
to
session
regularly
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
needs
some
minor
adjustments
try
it
its
pretty
good
this
beer
is
very
average
there
are
much
better
oktoberfest
beers
around
and
this
is
one
i
can
not
recommend
under
any
conditions
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
med
amber
with
a
hint
of
orange
with
a
1
in
head
that
quickly
disappeared
malty
semisweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
with
a
stronger
hop
influence
than
i
was
looking
for
and
a
little
off
at
the
finish
ive
had
a
few
different
bells
beers
and
this
one
just
isnt
up
to
their
standards
overall
just
a
very
average
marzen
kind
of
disappointing
mix
a
generic
malt
profile
with
subpar
hops
and
smudge
the
details
charge
a
little
too
much
and
here
we
are
one
was
plenty
a
slightly
below
average
octoberfest
not
offensive
but
not
a
great
oktoberfest
either
maybe
my
bottle
was
slightly
off
drinkability
very
easy
drink
will
definitely
seek
this
out
next
year
pours
a
very
clear
golden
copper
color
with
2
fingers
of
big
foamy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
smells
fruity
up
front
like
apricot
and
oranges
then
some
floral
hops
caramel
and
toasted
grainy
malt
tastes
of
honey
orange
and
grapefruit
juice
up
front
then
some
cereal
and
doughy
bread
malt
mixed
with
caramel
finishes
with
some
bitter
grassy
notes
medium
in
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
sweet
and
toasty
smooth
with
a
metallic
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
good
sessionable
lager
but
different
enough
from
others
in
the
style
that
this
isnt
what
id
grab
first
if
i
wanted
an
oktoberfest
da
fairly
decent
oktoberfest
the
potential
to
be
great
is
there
but
the
flaws
prevent
it
still
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
go
back
for
another
as
it
still
manages
to
trump
some
of
the
less
malty
versions
of
the
style
d
sure
you
could
drink
a
few
but
i
poured
mine
down
the
drain
its
an
easy
drink
but
only
a
soso
marzen
overall
i
thought
it
is
a
very
good
octoberfest
though
maybe
not
the
best
american
example
ive
had
d
a
decent
session
beer
not
my
top
choice
but
a
solid
offering
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
aspect
just
expected
a
little
bit
more
out
of
bells
to
be
honest
still
though
i
would
not
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
one
even
though
i
cannot
say
it
was
much
more
then
average
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
octoberfest
beer
maybe
not
as
hearty
as
some
examples
from
the
fatherland
but
rewarding
nonetheless
medium
body
low
carbonation
pretty
simple
and
easy
to
drink
not
bad
eric
d
a
good
but
not
great
oktoberfestbier
the
maltiness
is
a
little
too
much
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
robust
caramel
malt
and
cultured
german
yeast
with
sweet
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
cultured
yeast
and
caramel
malt
with
lemon
hops
and
a
bit
of
barley
and
pumpkin
spice
it
was
fairly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
clean
and
somewhat
drinkable
beer
it
had
good
body
but
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
the
flavor
i
could
still
drink
it
but
this
was
not
my
favorite
octoberfest
d
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
it
was
fairly
average
for
an
american
produced
oktoberfest
beer
would
i
order
another
probably
not
but
it
wasnt
to
the
point
where
i
refused
to
finish
the
beer
this
was
ok
for
the
style
but
it
was
the
little
things
lacking
here
and
there
that
kept
me
from
really
liking
this
not
bad
but
i
expect
a
little
more
from
bells
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foam
head
on
a
light
amber
body
smells
of
sweetness
caramel
a
touch
of
floral
and
a
whiff
of
hoppiness
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
with
the
hoppiness
coming
through
at
about
medium
none
of
the
flavors
were
remarkable
however
theyre
there
just
not
excitingly
it
has
above
average
hcarbonation
but
remains
smooth
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
good
brew
easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
are
much
better
i
must
say
that
i
was
pretty
let
down
by
this
beer
it
was
good
and
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
it
was
simply
average
in
every
way
this
beer
could
definitely
use
more
toasted
malt
character
i
hope
they
play
with
the
recipe
next
year
there
are
all
kinds
of
better
octoberfests
out
there
pours
an
extremely
clear
orange
brown
color
with
a
semi
sticky
white
head
very
slow
rising
carbonation
spicy
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
woody
and
musty
very
bright
with
flavor
dried
fruits
cinnamon
and
peppery
spice
and
nicely
balanced
good
hoppy
twang
and
solid
malt
backbone
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
damn
this
brew
is
drinkable
as
hell
im
loving
it
highly
recommended
wish
we
had
some
in
nj
the
beer
tastes
clean
with
roasted
malt
barley
and
hops
with
citrus
in
the
background
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
smooth
drinker
for
the
swilling
needs
i
may
get
a
sixer
just
to
slam
back
on
a
bender
taste
fine
for
those
purposes
but
with
that
in
mind
wouldnt
it
be
a
better
deal
to
get
a
sam
adams
oktoberfest
twelve
pack
d
what
this
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
a
very
easy
brew
to
handle
though
im
not
sure
why
the
alcohol
is
pulling
through
so
much
i
expected
more
from
bells
and
for
the
price
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
glad
i
could
try
this
it
wont
enter
a
regular
seasonal
rotation
though
overall
a
great
beer
and
defintely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
oktoberfests
i
poured
this
bland
tastless
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
orangey
looking
color
the
beer
had
a
tan
head
while
it
was
there
the
quickly
ewent
away
the
beer
was
sour
smelling
slightly
i
thought
it
was
very
tastless
for
an
octoberfest
beer
though
a
little
fruity
i
will
not
buy
again
even
so
its
pretty
good
regardless
of
how
well
it
fits
a
style
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
fine
carbonation
feel
and
drinkability
there
is
a
combination
of
toasty
biscuit
malts
with
a
slight
bit
of
hop
aroma
there
as
well
the
beer
is
a
copper
colour
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
flavour
is
really
smooth
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
accompany
the
main
flavour
toated
malts
the
toasted
malts
are
definitely
the
main
flavour
in
the
beer
its
almost
too
much
and
hinders
the
balance
of
sweetness
and
toasted
biscuit
a
sweetness
is
also
present
but
its
more
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
watery
pretty
drinkable
d
i
cant
believe
how
big
and
thick
and
malty
this
is
for
5
one
of
the
better
fests
i
have
had
this
year
d
this
is
a
decent
overall
oktoberfest
beer
that
i
could
fathom
drinking
a
sixer
of
as
long
as
i
dont
spill
it
like
i
did
while
reviewing
it
d
high
this
is
a
very
good
octoberfest
in
my
book
if
you
read
my
reviews
you
know
i
love
hops
so
this
ofest
fits
my
likes
exactly
very
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
and
will
probably
seek
it
out
bells
does
it
again
d
goes
down
fairly
easily
and
something
i
can
drink
very
easily
but
not
the
best
marzen
out
there
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
slight
head
that
falls
quickly
ever
so
faint
malt
aroma
the
flavor
displays
mild
malt
with
a
little
bit
floral
hops
on
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
inoffensive
the
beer
did
improve
somewhat
as
it
warmed
bringing
out
the
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
this
remains
a
merely
ok
beer
d
oktoberfests
rarely
turn
out
great
in
my
book
and
this
one
fits
the
same
bill
im
not
lusting
after
another
but
its
a
decent
brew
taste
has
dry
malt
with
dull
phenols
and
some
clean
alcohol
malt
is
toasted
with
some
tannic
or
astringent
edge
phenols
are
not
quite
clovey
more
pumpkin
pie
spice
aftertaste
is
mild
drying
phenol
and
acrid
carbonation
sting
thin
body
and
too
strong
of
carbonation
for
the
style
and
with
the
flavors
as
stretched
as
thin
as
they
are
drinkability
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
id
expect
better
from
bells
but
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
very
nice
for
the
season
of
course
pretty
average
oktoberfest
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
come
to
expect
better
from
bells
this
was
just
average
by
their
standards
clear
amber
with
many
bubbles
fighting
for
the
surface
the
amber
color
was
on
the
light
side
of
amber
the
head
quickly
fell
into
the
glass
slight
fruity
smell
evident
but
not
easy
to
detect
taste
was
slighty
toasted
and
malty
and
much
like
the
smell
with
not
alot
of
umph
very
carbonated
with
a
light
body
this
wasnt
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
options
on
the
shelf
d
not
as
solid
as
many
other
bell
offerings
which
is
surprising
still
drinkable
certainly
but
not
among
the
better
of
the
style
batch
8610
poured
a
mediumhazy
goldenamber
with
a
small
whithish
head
appears
heavily
carbonated
and
smells
malty
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
it
feels
mediumthinbodied
in
the
mouth
and
comes
out
with
a
crisp
malt
finish
there
isnt
much
to
the
flavor
but
if
you
like
a
solid
malt
then
by
golly
this
ones
for
you
nothing
to
write
home
to
mom
about
but
it
seems
alright
for
the
style
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
usual
craftsmanship
and
quality
that
bells
put
into
their
beer
this
is
watery
with
too
much
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
stale
or
sour
tang
to
the
taste
malt
body
is
decent
but
is
laced
with
metal
this
is
a
bit
less
polished
than
the
average
marzen
not
really
something
ill
look
out
for
in
the
future
honestly
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
but
lacking
in
several
area
a
run
of
the
mill
oct
fest
that
can
easily
be
skipped
for
far
better
versions
of
the
style
decent
overall
beer
but
nothing
exciting
not
the
best
example
of
an
octoberfestmarzen
imho
but
serviceable
d
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
anything
special
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
it
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
i
already
cant
wait
to
have
my
second
of
the
sixer
great
beer
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
flavor
from
this
ofest
flavor
is
sweet
with
subdued
complexity
initially
i
found
this
offering
overly
sweet
and
light
in
body
however
the
more
you
drink
the
stronger
the
toasted
malt
and
spicy
hop
becomes
that
said
this
is
still
a
rather
light
grainy
ofest
in
the
future
i
would
probably
pick
something
more
robust
drinkability
is
good
there
is
nothing
dramatic
about
this
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
i
would
not
turn
down
a
few
pitchers
of
this
in
a
session
with
friends
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
the
best
though
pretty
good
octoberfest
if
i
say
so
myself
nothing
complex
just
a
good
tasty
brew
perfect
for
the
season
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
incredibly
creamy
and
smooth
very
sessionable
indeed
eh
this
was
all
right
nothing
that
really
excited
me
but
a
nice
simple
representation
of
the
style
bells
has
better
beers
but
this
was
simple
and
solid
mouthfeel
is
crisp
very
flavorful
and
good
weight
nice
overall
definitely
what
i
would
want
in
an
octoberfest
d
ive
had
quite
a
few
october
fests
this
year
from
various
brewers
and
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
octoberfests
out
there
at
the
same
time
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink

breadcereal
and
a
little
bit
of

is
similar
to
but
a
bit
stronger
than
the

but
theres
also
some
caramel

in

too
it
is
mostly

does

slight
bitter

it
has
a

above

drinkability
is
very
good
its
quite
sessionable
as
its
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
this
is
the
first
ofest
beer
ive
had
this
year
and
its
pretty
decent
id
buy
this
again
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
of
beer
the
carbonation
is
pretty
heavy
and
the
body
is
fairly
light
very
juicy
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
easy
to
sip
but
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
i
would
not
only
get
this
again
but
i
would
drink
it
yearround
a
tremendous
beer
to
say
the
least
body
pours
to
a
perfect
golden
amber
alost
honey
in
color
head
is
a
fluffy
tan
biscuit
that
stands
at
two
fingers
but
quickly
fades
to
just
a
skim
as
i
finish
this
sentence
nose
is
a
soft
mineral
snap
of
nutty
hints
and
attractive
maltiness
at
first
sip
you
cant
help
but
thinking
of
yourself
raising
an
oversized
mug
of
this
in
the
middle
of
a
german
festival
singing
and
eating
brats
super
smooth
zesty
maltiness
that
is
a
lot
like
a
buttered
bisciut
with
drizzled
honey
a
nutty
metalic
feel
sticks
to
the
top
of
the
mouth
there
is
a
slight
nop
of
hops
on
the
end
of
the
palate
but
it
is
ever
so
brief
the
malts
really
create
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
is
common
to
the
style
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
americanized
i
really
wouldnt
consider
this
a
true
maerzen
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
there
is
hardly
any
roasted
aroma
and
no
maltiness
that
makes
this
style
so
great
it
is
also
a
little
high
in
the
ibu
department
despite
all
that
there
is
a
bit
of
flavoring
and
aroma
hops
present
just
enough
to
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
at
cellar
temp
i
guess
i
made
the
mistake
of
keeping
the
six
pack
in
the
fridge
and
not
letting
the
first
few
bottles
warm
up
enough
which
made
it
taste
a
little
too
bitter
drinking
it
at
5055
degrees
really
improved
my
opinion
of
this
beer
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
i
think
well
see
a
lot
more
of
this
in
late
2008
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
seems
to
be
missing
that
strong
maltiness
there
is
a
toasted
feel
but
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
company
that
likes
to
push
the
envelope
d
eh
not
too
sure
about
this
after
taste
its
ok
but
not
fitting
the
style
well
enough
one
of
the
better
american
ofests
i
recall
it
being
even
better
on
tap
as
a
disclaimer
i
am
not
much
of
an
ofest
fan
i
like
the
sa
version
and
this
one
isnt
bad
but
this
isnt
a
style
i
search
out
d
overall
a
decent
enough
marzenoktoberfest
style
beer
not
exceptional
but
well
done
though
this
is
one
of
my
personal
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
full
malty
flavor
backed
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
it
is
well
built
and
certainly
fits
the
style
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
overall
pretty
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
and
felt
it
had
good
balance
nice
flavor
and
was
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
dont
think
that
was
what
they
were
shooting
for
very
sessionable
pours
a
clear
orangecopper
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
has
decent
retention
spotty
lacing
throughout
with
a
thin
ring
at
the
top
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
with
touches
of
sweet
spice
and
hops
medium
body
with
roasted
malt
caramel
and
hops
flavors
the
finish
is
malty
and
nutty
at
first
with
a
lightly
peppered
hops
aftertaste
pretty
simple
for
a
bells
beer
quite
honestly
average
overall
given
the
taste
bud
saturating
excellence
that
bells
usually
delivers
octoberfest
beer
is
a
disappointment
maybe
its
my
big
beer
bias
but
when
it
comes
to
this
style
heartier
maltier
is
almost
always
better
two
heartier
hoppier
wouldnt
be
too
bad
either
d
interesting
and
great
mouthfeel
ill
probably
have
it
again
when
the
season
rolls
around
copperorange
color
with
a
white
cap
that
fades
pretty
quickly

nose
of
florals
soft
to
bright
fruits

banana
and
light
caramel
nutty
earthy
malty
grains
balanced
well
by
hop
flavors
of
orange
citrus
slightly
tangy
tea
herbals
and
some
spicy
to
bitter
notes
lay
on
the
tongue
just
before
it
finishes
mild
to
medium
carbonation
is
just
crisp
enough
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
is
a
nice
smoothness
the
finish
is
dryer
grainy
and
some
tart
that
all
hangs
around
long
enough
for
the
next
sip
a
very
quaffable
fall
selection
this
is
the
last
of
my
six
pack
and
i
am
glad
i
made
this
purchase
i
will
certainly
give
this
beer
the
thumbs
up
to
any
friend
looking
to
try
a
quality
oktoberfest
a
nice
suppin
ale
thats
for
sure
oall
a
nicely
balanced
malt
oriented
beer
the
slightly
bitter
finish
might
annoy
after
a
while
but
it
does
keep
it
from
becoming
sickenly
sweet
well
most
everything
bells
is
usually
a
hit
with
me
but
id
say
this
one
is
a
miss
the
extra
eight
bucks
a
case
over
the
other
ofests
definitely
isnt
worth
it
there
are
better
offerings
to
be
had
this
one
ranks
with
leinenkugels
ofest
and
michelob
marzen
when
it
comes
to
being
uninspired
overall
a
simple
quite
drinkable
beer
not
exactly
packed
with
flavor
not
some
grandiose
experience
but
not
much
to
turn
you
off
about
it
it
went
well
with
a
piece
of
pumpkin
chocolate
chip
bread
done
of
my
favorite
octoberfest
beers
i
will
def
have
this
again
will
be
looking
for
it
on
tap
i
was
disappointed
in
this
offering
ive
had
plenty
of
great
bells
beers
in
the
past
and
this
was
quite
a
letdown
flavors
were
off
and
rather
unenjoyable
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
i
kind
of
wish
i
didnt
waste
the
money
on
a
six
pack
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
good
balance
between
sweetness
toastiness
and
bitter
hops
could
stand
to
be
just
a
tad
bit
more
drinkable
but
it
was
worth
trying
overal
a
nice
american
ofest
better
than
most
of
the
us
ofest
but
still
not
up
there
with
the
originals
from
munich
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
while
it
didnt
do
a
lot
to
set
its
self
apart
from
other
versions
id
rank
it
up
there
with
my
other
favorites
from
both
american
and
german
brewers
this
beer
started
out
pretty
good
for
me
with
a
nice
gold
to
amber
color
and
1
tanish
foam
head
aroma
was
more
of
overdone
toast
not
the
bready
melnoidans
of
better
oktos
aftertaste
left
an
undesirable
bitterness
or
flavor
that
shouldnt
have
been
there
either
and
was
more
noticeable
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
glass
id
say
mouthfeel
was
as
it
should
be
just
a
little
on
the
thick
side
all
in
all
bells
makes
mostly
great
beers
this
is
just
not
one
of
them
at
5
this
is
an
easy
one
to
have
a
bunch
of
d
enjoyable
fal
offering
from
bells
very
smooth
and
builds
some
uniqueness
into
the
classic
marzen
style
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
the
adequate
carbonation
gives
it
an
excellent
crisp
feel
an
awesome
drinker
here
i
dont
know
if
it
would
ever
get
old
before
spring
came
around
hazy
blazing
orange
of
course
its
not
clear
its
bells
thin
dirty
white
head
little
retention
lace
is
sporadic
really
nice
aroma
i
like
the
emphasis
on
the
toasted
malt
qualities
on
the
nose
i
also
get
some
biscuit
malt
and
a
little
caramel
malt
as
well
the
malts
lay
a
pretty
solid
foundation
the
toasted
character
isnt
quite
as
prominent
as
it
was
on
the
nose
but
its
there
with
the
usual
suspects
biscuit
caramel
and
yeasty
doughiness
carbonation
lends
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
attribute
to
this
medium
bodied
lager
not
a
particularily
bold
ofest
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
while
this
may
be
a
very
sessionable
beer
its
because
there
is
not
much
flavor
here
and
its
lacking
the
character
one
would
expect
for
an
oktoberfest
overall
though
it
serves
its
purpose
one
could
easily
down
a
6er
of
these
without
much
of
a
problem
easy
drinking
that
get
it
while
you
can
its
a
good
one
d
disappointing
especially
for
bells
tasty
lineup
in
reviewing
this
beer
i
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
marzen
is
one
of
the
original
session
beers
and
consequently
must
be
relatively
easygoing
this
beer
does
a
nice
job
of
managing
to
be
interesting
and
yet
very
mellow
perhaps
just
a
touch
on
the
timid
side
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
maltyness
but
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
impression
a
bit
light
for
my
tastes
doesnt
quite
have
the
malt
backbone
i
would
expect
in
an
oktoberfest
despite
this
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
that
im
sure
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
the
6er
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
head
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
it
smells
like
bread
and
yeast
but
it
is
really
subdued
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
bread
not
much
else
there
decent
carbonation
but
it
has
thin
mouthfeel
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
light
oktoberfest
beer
this
would
be
it
very
sessionable
but
not
big
on
flavor
would
make
a
good
beer
garden
offering
another
good
offering
from
bells
keep
up
the
good
work
dont
drink
and
review
a
lighter
style
ofest
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
malty
rich
big
ofest
this
isnt
it
this
is
subtle
but
tasty
in
its
own
way
personally
i
would
chose
several
others
in
the
future
over
this
because
i
prefer
a
bigger
ofest
but
i
could
see
this
appealing
to
a
lot
of
people
looking
for
something
a
little
lighter
medium
body
a
decent
beer
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
for
the
style
d
even
for
a
subtle
style
like
a
marzen
this
beer
seemed
to
lack
a
personality
of
its
own
which
is
unexpected
from
a
brewery
like
bells
nevertheless
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
this
one
is
easily
drinkable
but
theres
not
enough
excitement
to
keep
you
coming
back
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
releases
from
bells
its
just
very
hohum
compared
to
their
other
releases
it
could
stand
a
little
hop
punch
and
more
flavor
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
letdown
considering
it
is
bells
after
all
pours
a
clean
pale
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
that
are
earthy
and
somewhat
fruity
in
the
taste
some
of
the
same
earthy
and
hints
of
fruit
but
not
overbarring
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
sweetness
of
an
aftertaste
not
a
typical
oktoberfest
but
a
nice
twist
easy
and
tasty
a
nice
straighttostyle
type
of
beer
but
a
little
ordinary
in
the
whole
scheme
of
oktoberfests
standard
orange
copper
color
with
terrific
head
retention
and
brilliant
clarity
aromas
are
malty
hopped
for
balance
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
all
coming
together
quite
well
flavors
are
bready
and
rich
with
hops
offsetting
the
sweetness
and
contributing
a
light
grassy
flavor
textures
are
firm
and
creamy
providing
a
firm
pillow
for
the
mellow
flavors
and
spices
finishes
with
a
mild
dry
hop
finish
good
beer
but
likely
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
d
a
very
quaffable
lighter
version
of
an
octoberfest
a
crisp
clean
finish
makes
it
easy
to
have
multiples
but
not
a
very
flavorful
fest
overall
tried
a
normal
nongerman
octoberfest
to
give
me
a
reference
point
for
surlyfest
this
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
remember
most
other
octoberfest
beers
drinkability
this
would
be
a
great
session
ofest
for
a
tailgate
before
a
football
game
on
a
cool
day
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
brew
is
full
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
as
befits
the
style
it
drinks
easy
and
is
a
good
session
beer
though
there
are
better
brews
that
depict
the
style
better
also
better
brews
out
there
that
not
only
depict
the
style
but
add

take
on
the

i
didnt

that
this
beer
did
anything
particularly
memorable
though
on

a

dried
it

a

in

a
bit
middle
of
the
road
not
bad
and
its
drinkable
just
not
earth
shattering
overall
a
fantastic
take
on
the
style
not
too
sweet
not
lacking
in
flavor
just
wished
it

a

longer
when
it
comes
to
the
flavormouthfeel
experience
i
like
to
savor
my
ofests
while
this
one
begs
gulp
after
to
gulp
to
savor
imho
but
then
again
if
thats
what
most
people
thought
and
i
was
the

i
would
be
very
happy

the

mainly
due

to
the
beers
lighter
characteristics
and
its
5
abv
overall
a
solid
session
ofest
but
a
little
sweeter
and
not
malty
enough
in
my
opinion
would
consider
purchasing
again
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
out
if
you
want
an
all
around
amazing
oktoberfest
try
the
great
lakes
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
stunning
amber
hues
the
head
is
large
fluffy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
and
noble
hops
but
is
somewhat
faint
and
simple
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
has
a
nice
bready
backbone
but
the
hops
are
very
light
and
bitterness
is
low
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
velvety
smoothness
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
but
it
lacks
any
sort
of
complexity
it
is
an
odd
thing
for
bells
to
make
a
beer
that
i
dont
love
but
they
did
so
here
i
could
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
think
i
will
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
wowing
and
a
touch
sweet
for
not
having
much
oomph
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
left
little
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
with
a
hint
of
pepper
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
medium
light
body
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
a
finish
not
bad
for
the
style
got
this
one
cause
i
havent
had
a
bells
beer
yet
that
didnt
impress
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissolves
to
little
puddles
of
white
foam
on
top
looks
solid
although
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
nose
is
mostly
light
caramel
malt
and
some
fruity
drying
hops
as
well
a
little
grainy
taste
is
interesting
although
maybe
because
i
havent
had
too
many
octoberfests
some
dry
roasted
malt
and
some
breadiness
also
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
molasses
or
brown
sugar
theres
a
light
hint
of
hops
at
the
tail
end
of
this
one
but
its
definitely
dominated
by
malt
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
this
ones
okay
ill
need
to
try
more
of
the
style
to
see
if
its
better
or
worse
than
whatever
else
is
out
there
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
a
bit
too
bready
at
times
but
on
the
whole
an
entirely
drinkable
beer
i
love
bells
and
they
do
some
excellent
beers
so
its
nice
to
see
them
trying
out
new
seasonal
stuff
its
a
nice
light
amber
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
crystal
clear
the
beers
aroma
is
exceedingly
bready
and
slightly
yeasty
the
slight
fruit
aromas
i
get
are
of
the
german
hops
but
the
aroma
of
them
isnt
strong
the
taste
starts
off
with
the
bready
yeast
flavor
but
turns
into
sweet
malts
toasty
and
slightly
solvently
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
crisp
up
front
it
smooths
out
as
it
moves
along
and
has
a
slight
residual
bitterness
right
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
all
in
all
an
oktoberfest
a
nice
plate
of
light
cheddar
maybe
or
some
bavarian
pretzels
would
be
a
nice
compliment
mouthfeel
is
sweet
up
front
medium
bodied
doughy
and
semidry
ambercaramel

with
sheet
of

easy
steamy
pale

aromas
scented
with
moist

and
cereal
workable
watery
texture
punctuated
with
fizz
and
oily
bitterness
that
provide
definition
for
apple
straw
and
green
plum
tartness
overall
a
drinker
i
want
just
a
little
more
texture
and
viscosity
pours
a
clear
as
day
copper
with
a
fluffy
head
that
dies
quick
smells
of
bread
and
grain
tastes
as
it
smells
bread
grain
some
very
mild
sweetness
and
tiny
bite
at
the
finish
feels
medium
to
light
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
very
easy
a
tasty
octoberfest
brew
but
nothing
that
stands
out
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
lingers
and
slowly
fades
away
smell
is
grains
rice
and
a
maltiness
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
some
spices
limited
carbonation
on
this
one
makes
for
a
crisp
smooth
drink
nice
offering
and
look
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
bells
oktoberfest
was
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
didnt
have
that
high
craggy
head
that
the
great
german
ofests
do
but
had
some
nice
malts
couldve
used
a
few
more
very
smooth
with
a
slight
hoppy
kickback
highly
drinkable
on
a
fall
night
some
slight
caramel
flavoring
and
a
nice
orangishbrown
color
an
overall
decent
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfest
overall
one
of
the
better
octoberfest
beers
ive
had
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
d
a
great
sessionable
beer
this
is
fall
in
the
bottle
another
worthwhile
addition
to
bells
lineup
d
this
is
a
great
light
autumn
brew
very
delicate
but
very
pleasing
nothing
to
be
searched
for
but
it
is
a
good
buy
if
youre
looking
of
something
new
overall
this
was
a
very
respectable
octoberfest
it
seemed
a
bit
disappointing
at
first
but
it
opened
up
towards
the
end
it
definitely
strays
a
bit
from
the
authentic
german
style
though
drinkability
you
can
pound
these
back

night

reviewed
on

2006
on
tap
at
the
downtowner
lounge
houghton
mi
this
keg
has
probably
been
on
for
a
good
while
as
this
isnt
the
type
of
bar
where
people
would
drink
this
beer
i
was
quite
glad
to
still
find
this
on
tap
it
seems
to
be
a
rather
rare
bells
draft
despite
having
been
released
throughout
the
state
lemon
fringed
with
an
orange
core
creamy
froth
of
offwhite
light
wispy
aroma
of
creamy
malts
and
light
oatiness
a
touch
of
graininess
sweet
sugary
lightly
estered
malt
with
some
barnyard
oat
qualities
and
a
touch
of
hay
not
as
much
of
the
heavy
munich
malt
character
as
i
expected
from
the
style
backend
presents
a
slightly
sourish
lemon
tang
and
a
nip
of
aged
yeast
i
can
tell
this
keg
has
been
on
for
a
while
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
detract
the
smack
is
one
of
the
more
profound
of
any
beer
ive
had
for
a
good
while
a
long
lingering
clean
mint
and
lemon
bite
that
hangs
out
along
with
a
jumble
of
barnyard
sweet
malt
esters
and
clear
midroasted
unfermented
crystal
character
an
interesting
rendition
in
my
opinion
im
sure
why
everyone
else
has
this
beer
so
down
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
nicely
refreshing
and
light
must
remember
to
stop
comparing
perfectly
fine
examples
of
a
style
against
those
versions
that
skirt
outside
the
boundaries
12
oz
pour
from
notes
the
beer
was
a
mild
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
fell
to
a
small
island
over
top
of
the
brew
clarity
was
fantastic
and
a
mild
carbonation
was
present
cascading
towards
the
surface
good
looking
but
maybe
a
touch
light
in
color
aroma
was
grainy
fairly
light
with
a
mild
bready
sweetness
in
the
background
flavor
was
very
bready
with
mild
sweetness
and
toastyness
the
grainyness
was
pretty
full
in
there
and
a
mild
bitterness
hit
on
the
finish
i
thought
it
was
tasty
mouthfeel
was
a
solid
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
that
gives
the
brew
the
feel
of
more
thickness
than
it
truly
had
overall
i
liked
the
brew
it
was
a
little
more
grainy
than
i
would
have
liked
and
the
nose
was
lighter
than
expected
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
easy
drinking
appearance
is
slightly
clouded
copper
with
a
large
off
white
head
leaves
a
collar
of
lace
dwindles
down
and
leaves
behind
specks
of
lacing
aroma
has
fruity
caramel
sweet
bready
mix
from
the
malt
profile
with
a
slight
spicy
character
with
bitey
grassy
noble
hop
presence
seems
a
bit
muted
even
after
warming
the
brew
for
a
little
in
my
hands
taste
has
a
light
noticeable
alcohol
note
with
creamy
light
fruty
subtle
caramel
malt
flow
light
bitterness
with
a
quality
overal
mix
of
flavors
finishes
like
a
light
herbal
tea
my
excitement
exceeded
the
actual
experience
of
trying
this
brew
im
a
pretty
much
overall
bells
fan
but
this
one
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
textured
with
mild
prickly
bubbles
hitting
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
but
due
to
the
somewhat
lack
of
flavor
id
much
rather
go
with
a
penn
or
great
lakes
octoberfest
brew
nice
to
see
a
cloudy
fest
and
i
will
drink
it
again
but
i
was
under
wowed
by
it
i
really
like
the
bells
beerthis
one
was
just
a
little
disapointing
to
me
i
had
this
beer
today
over
dinner
with
the
family
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
oktoberfest
of
late
and
looked
forward
to
this
offering
from
bells
i
had
a
pint
on
tap
it
was
a
pleasing
amber
with
a
thin
head
with
slight
lacing
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
a
bit
mild
and
lacking
for
my
taste
i
have
been
drinking
german
oktoberfests
and
am
unsure
if
i
am
spoiled
or
what
it
is
a
good
enough
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
this
was
the
only
thing
on
tap
i
had
not
had
at
the
exchequer
pub
in
down
town
so
i
tried
it
i
have
to
admit
i
wasnt
able
to
spend
as
much
time
on
this
one
as
i
do
with
most
simply
because
i
was
with
company
however
i
did
make
some
quick
mental
notes
during
the
course
of
my
meal
it
had
a
decent
head
not
too
wild
looked
like
a
lager
with
a
slightly
more
caramely
tarnished
color
smell
was
subtle
hints
of
spice
hay
maybe
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
was
decent
some
caramel
a
little
hops
kind
malt
and
spice
again
i
didnt
get
to
spend
too
much
time
with
this
but
over
all
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
seasonal
beer
mostly
likely
i
would
not
buy
a
bottle
until
ive
had
a
couple
more
oktoberfests
for
referance
but
if
it
was
at
a
fest
and
cheep
i
might
go
for
it
right
away
moderate
mouth
with
just
enough
carbonation
its
drinkable
and
could
make
for
a
good
dinner
beer
but
it
is
a
rather
standard
okto
fest
and
i
wouldnt
go
to
any
great
lengths
to
seek
this
one
this
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
substantial
yellowish
white
head
and
leaves
substantial
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
the
least
pleasant
thing
about
this
beerthere
is
a
distinct
sulfery
odor
thankfully
there
is
no
trace
of
that
in
the
taste
there
is
a
distinctly
grassy
flavor
along
with
a
creamy
caramel
blast
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
rich
and
the
only
thing
hampering
the
drinkability
is
the
aforementioned
smell
a
very
nice
octoberfest
creamy
carbonated

easily

light
coppery
color
with

aroma
is
a
lightly
sweet
maltiness
mixed
with
cooked
grains
there
is
also
a
little
earthygrassiness
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
gentle
malty
sweetness
that
is
smooth
on
the
palette
and
is
followed
by
a
nice
and
light
pepperyspicey
hoppiness
the
beer
is
very
creamy
and
soft
and
i
found
the
sweetness
to
be
light
and
not
overpowering
and
well
balanced
by
the
subtle
spice
and
dryness
from
the
hops
i
could
easily
see
myself
sessioning
this
and
was
wishing
bells
had
to
go
containers
available
as
i
left
poured
from
bomber
a
deep
dark
brown
amber
with
about
one
finger
of
strong
head
aroma
was
potent
and
sweetsmelling
and
reminded
me
specifically
of
barleywine
taste
gave
the
same
impression
and
i
was
surprised
to
know
this
was
not
a
barleywine
technically
very
sweet
malty
flavors
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
easy
to
drink
0
a
very
well
made
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
traditional
marzen
style
oktoberfest
beer
this
isnt
it
this
is
an
imperial
oktoberfest
as
one
reviewer
said
this
seems
to
be
better
suited
as
a
holiday
beer
served
after
thanksgiving
ill
be
curious
to
see
if
this
style
becomes
more
popular
something
tells
me
it
will
overall
nothing
to
criticize
with
this
beer
quite
delicious
the
kaiser
may
be
intended
as
an
autumn
beer
but
nearly
everything
about
it
right
down
to
its
warming
alcohol
presence
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
christmas
actually
theres
a
striking
amount
of
similarity
to
eggenbergs
samichlaus
i
like
the
beer
a
great
deal
but
sure
tis
no
oktoberfest
buy
a
bomber
but
dont
open
it
until
the
pumpkin
is
composting
and
the
tree
is
decorated
and
lit
nice
very
good
take
on
an
imperial
oktoberfest
but
the
bigness
wasnt
necessary
for
me
a
sipper
for
sure
but
really
didnt
set
itself
apart
overall
i
am
over
the
oktoberfests
i
really
dont
care
for
them
they
are
boring
this
one
only
amps
up
the
booze
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
with
little
taste
profile
then
this
is
the
one
for
you
actually
they
are
all
pretty
much
that
way
this
one
just
gives
you
more
alcohol
if
oktoberfests
are
for
you
then
you
will
probably
like
this
one
more
than
most
a
rich
dense
body
with
a
palate
that
in
my
limited
estimation
accentuates
the
typical
malty
profile
from
traditional
oktoberfestmarzens
the
frame
of
reference
in
mind
are
the
usual
hofbrau
though
pale
paulaner
spaten
etc
nothing
less
expected
from
an
imperial
style
typical
of
avery
sweet
for
a
10
loving
this
not
too
bad
but
just
a
tad
sweet
the
body
i
liked
even
if
not
exactly
indicative
of
style
not
sure
going
imperial
in
this
style
works
for
me
but
an
interesting
concept
overall
there
beer
almost
runs
the
risk
of
being
a
doppelbock
either
way
i
would
still
have
another
it
was
delicious
o
this
was
awful
no
two
ways
about
it
i
would
only
recommend
this
to
my
worst
enemies
and
hope
to
god
i
never
have
to
see
this
again
high
score
for
this
style
didnt
know
there
was
an
imperial
marzen
but
glad
there
is
and
hope
more
are
coming
this
is
heavy
and
sweet
having
a
pioneer
type
taste
to
it
i
really
hope
brewers
try
to
improve
on
this
beer
style
as
i
like
it
but
think
it
could
be
greatly
updated
overall
id
rather
pick
up
a
sixer
of
sam
adams
oktoberfest
for
the
same
price
as
this
bomber
o
this
is
definitely
a
strong
oktoberfest
with
some
hints
of
barleywine
to
it
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
enjoyable
though
i
would
caution
that
it
is
a
sipper
not
one
that
should
be
drank
quickly
tasty
as
is
but
this
offering
would
be
a
candidate
for
barrel
aging
that
is
if
lagers
can
be
barrel
aged
a
very
tasty
imperial
twist
on
a
classic
style
the
alcohol
burn
readily
appears
but
luckily
the
rich
deep
malt
flavors
balance
things
out
there
is
an
intriguing
hint
of
a
pumpkin
ale
buried
within
the
heavy
malt
and
high
abv
that
just
adds
more
character
and
complexity
to
the
beer

a

just
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
little
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
maybe
could
use
some
aging
overall
this
is
solid
but
it
is
too
sweet
and
boozy
right
now
it
feels
almost
like
a
barleywine
that
could
use
some
aging
as
expected
this
is
a
pleasant
offshoot
of
the
current
watched
style
rendered
in
a
wholly
newworld
american
sense
if
one
is
ok
with
the
duly
overclocked

that
is
an

with

of

all
in
all
it
comes
together
to
make
a
dense

beer
that
is
very
much
imperial
tasting
even
goes
down
with
a
mild
boozy
kick
on
occasion
but
apart
from
being
big
and
boozy
it
just
hits
the
spot
equal

dont
get
much
of
the
imperial
part

an
alright

hints
of

malt
bomb
for
sure
but
with
a
balance

that
is
impressive
the
body
is
smooth
and
robust

light
enough
to
quaff
roasted
sweet
rich

aftertaste
with
a

as
you
work

the

a
slightly

linger
that
makes
you
want
more
solid
brew
poured
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
around
60
degrees
o
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
after
dinner
sipper
still
it
is
such
extreme
example
of
a
marzen
that
it
doesnt
even
really
belong
in
the

category
full

medium

definitely
tasty
and
a

if
the

were
dialed
down
a
bit
it
would
be
more
balanced
vegetable
rind
could
even
be
a
tasting
note
overall
i
was
a
little
let
down
that
this
was
hardly
a
lager
but
more
so
a
pumpkin
ale
still
delicious
regardless
though
great

bit
rocket
fuely

liquoresque
but
not
as
overblown
as
i
may
have
expected
i
had
this
blind
and
its
given
avery
a
big
hit
in
the
average
ratings
another
example
of
a
style
that
doesnt
need
to
be
imperialised
oda
double
octoberfest
sounds
awesome
this
one
was
worth
a
try
but
didnt
impress
me
much
i
feel
like
this
interpretation
of
the
marzen
could
work
and
many
would
say
kaiser
does
indeed
work
but
this
one
doesnt
work
for
me
i
would
still
say
its
at
worse
a
mediocre
strong
ale
a
little
messy
at
times
and
could
be
cleaner
but
all
the
right
flavors
are
there
i
could
go
for
a
little
less
fruit
as
well
this
is
not
your
average
oktoberfest
its
big
bold
and
tasty
with
a
warming
alcohol
bite
at
the
same
time
i
wish
i
drank
this
outside
on
a
nice
crisp
cool
fall
day
as
that
would
have
matched
this
beer
and
essence
perfectly
a
great
seasonal
treat
that
was
very
tasty
for
such
a
strong
brew
not
a
session
beer
and
not
for
a
hophead
as
this
is
sweet
and
malty
but
certainly
one
to
enjoy
as
the
temperature
drops
overall
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
taste
is
also
full
of
sticky
sweet
caramel
malt
some
dried
fruit
and
toffee
sticky
on
the
lips
and
full
bodied
tastes
like
a
barleywine
overly
sweet
and
boozy
not
remotely
like
an
oktoberfest
or
even
a
lager
even
in
a
small
dose
it
wasnt
all
that
drinkable
or
enjoyable
maybe
in
an
after
dinner
drink
scenario
it
would
fare
better
but
it
fell
pretty
short
in
my
opinion
d
certainly
on
of
the
more
interesting
marzen
oktroberfest
offerings
that
ive
come
across
definitely
lives
up
to
its
imperial
label
stellar
appearance
and
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
rather
assertive
and
quite
pleasing
as
well
without
doubt
one
of
the
better
marzen
oktoberfest
offerings
on
the
market
certainly
worth
investing
in
a
bottle
for
late
september
early
october
each
year
cant
compare
it
to
the
usual
oktoberfest
suspects
as
its
its
own
beast
its
huge
and
works
well
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
love
the
restrained
richness
the
malt
characters
the
booze
the
feel
which
goes
from
rich
and
full
to
light
and
crisp
i
somewhat
stupidly
feared
that
this
bottle
might
be
quite
old
after
all
it
was
clearly
grey
imported
and
it
was
some
time
ago
that
i
even
acquired
it
but
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
which
works
well
even
if
it
is
old
and
if
this
bottle
is
past
its
prime
then
goddamn
this
must
be
amazing
at
its
peak
insane
imperial
oktoberfest
seasonal
from
avery
cracked
a
bomber
and
split
with
my
wife
after
drinking
paulaner
all
afternoon
great
way
to
finish
the
evening
pours
a
deep
coppery
red
with
very
little
head
awesome
color
just
looks
like
a
badass
beer
heavy
cherry
on
the
nose
malt
bread
surprising
melon
element
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
strawberry
10
2
abv
and
absolutely
no
indication
of
it
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
large
format
avery
brews
really
nicely
done
the
flavors
and
the
feel
are
thick
rich
and
savory
mentioned
to
be
an
oktoberfest
this
has
more
elements
of
a
barley
wine
proportional
sweetness
to
malt
dryness
the
toasted
grain
mixes
well
with
dried
fruit
elements
i
catch
a
little
date
prune
and
grape
along
with
a
some
bran
barley
and
oat
well
balanced
and
awfully
drinkable
this
is
deceptively
10
pct
abv
not
a
fan
of
big
beers
but
this
is
the
exception
the
aroma
is
orange
orange
blossom
you
can
tell
this
is
a
big
beer
you
get
a
full
mouthful
with
this
beer
it
tastes
of
citrus
only
now
much
more
grapefruit
hops
but
also
a
lot
of
maltiness
if
you
like
beer
with
everything
then
this
is
the
one
for
you
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
ill
rush
to
pick
up
often
even
if
it
was
a
year
round
offering
there
are
other
high
abv
beers
that
i
enjoy
better
overall
a
really
nice
beer

german
style
lager
pulled
off
with
finesse
overall
absolutely
delicious
great
oktoberfest
representation
love
the
caramel
sweetness
o
a
very
good
oktoberfest
much
better
than
what
i
am
used
to
trying
around
that
time
of
year
style
is
too
sweet
for
me
but
very
good
for
the
style
o
a
nice
offering
from
avery
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
a
bit
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
in
my
opinion
but
still
good
besides
i
dont
know
of
many
imperial
oktoberfests
so
this
is
pretty
cool
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
satisfying
overall
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
beer
is
dark
fruit
dominant
a
lot
of
plums
and
figs
very
reminiscent
of
a
doppelbock
a
lot
of
toffee
notes
and
caramel
a
lot
of
caramel
and
sugary
breddy
flavors
a
slight
bit
of
grain
and
mineral
tastes
one
of
the
best
strong
oktoberfests
i
have
tried
too
bad
10
isnt
traditional
to
the
style
because
the
beer
is
quite
good
o
a
big
boozy
marzen
thats
thick
and
full
a
bold
take
on
the
style
its
almost
a
novelty
but
one
wellworth
experiencing
imagine
making
an
oktoberfest
doppel
this
is
it
overall
i
very
much
like
this
ive
had
a
few
from
this
brewery
and
i
remember
them
being
very
good
it
tastes
like
a
german
product
which
i
think
is
an
accomplishment
and
an
achievement
and
for
such
an
impressive
abv
i
think
it
deserves
a
very
high
overall
rating
i
dont
get
much
alcohol
burn
from
this
and
that
factors
in
to
my
opinion
may
be
my
highest
rated
american
beer
cheers
o
wow
this
is
a
big
and
bold
ofest
one
of
my
favorite
styles
with
an
imperial
twist
definitely
a
different
kind
of
beer
and
one
id
recommend
you
try
beer
is
medium
to
big
in
body
much
bigger
than
i
expected
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
on
the
back
end
a
strong
flavor
really
malty
mildly
sweet
minimal
yeast
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
have
it
again
on
draft
o
i
like
the
extreme
nature
of
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
potent
form
of
this
style
this
is
right
up
your
alley
another
interesting
note
is
that
after
imperialising
this
beer
doesnt
really
retain
any
qualities
that
identify
it
as
marzen
its
more
like
a
belgian
pale
and
a
doppelbock
had
a
baby
dont
get
me
wrong

is
a

here
as
well
as

the

some

taste

from

the

is
just
ok
this
is
a
big
beer
hot
feel
on

along
with
some
orange

and
melon

the
body
is
a

medium

cinnamon
most
attributed
with
that
combination
the
only
deviation
from
that
flavor
is
there
is
a

flavor
that
reminds
you
this
is
more
of
a
college
breakfast
than
you
wanted
it
to
be
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
too
syrupy
for
my
liking
with
regards
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
lack
of
carbonation
to
make
it
have
that
pop
it
needs
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
boozy
and

for
me
to
say
that

d
hmm
if
i
were
only
consuming
a
4oz
sample
i
would
say
that
this
is
very
drinkable
alas
this
is
a
22oz
bottle
and
after
my
first
8oz
serving
the
booziness
quininelike
bitterness
and
astringent
carbonation
became
big
detractors
and
i
felt
obligated
to
drink
the
remaining
volume
best

bottle
with

people
served
in
a
tulip
glass
it
has
a
one
finger
amberwhite
head
that
leaves
moderate

the
color
is
clear
dark
amber
almost
red
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
sweet
almost
no
hop
smell
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
strongly
malty
and
sweet
with
accents
of
cherry
maple
and
maybe
coffee
the
hops
again
to
me
are
light
and
nondescript
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
moderately
carbonated
i
was
surprise
to
see
that
the
alcohol
content
is
so
high
that
does
not
come
out
in
the
taste
at
all
id
be
saving
this
one
for
a
quaff
now
and
then
dont
see
that
id
be
knocking
a
lot
of
these
back
in
one
session
its
a
little
too
rich
for
that
nice
beer
definitely
a
nice
step
up
from
a
lighter
oktoberfest
a
little
over
board
with
the
alcohol
taste
to
it
kind
of
beats
down

and
with

its
not
a
looker
still
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
can
see
the
double
marzen
but
could
also
be
described
as
somewhere
around
a
pale
winter
warmer
or
a
big
maibock
a
decent
fall
sipper
and
worth
a
try
for
ofest
collectors
d
definitely
not
an
octoberfest
tastes
more
like
a
lighter
bodied
dopplebock
with
some
other
stuff
going
on
it
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
im
gonna
run
out
and
buy
again
worth
a
try
for
lager
lovers
d
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
which
i
find
overly
impressive
the
alcohol
the
bottle
lists
alcohol
at
10
03
as
opposed
to
what
is
listed
above
is
ever
present
and
gives
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
harsh
unrefined
feel
to
it
while
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
over
the
top
more
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
than
an
oktoberfest
the
taste
has
alcohol
evident
right
up
front
but
not
harshly
and
in
a
darkraisiny
way
with
gentle
spiciness
soon
toasty
grain
and
raisin
appear
with
a
fruityjammy
quality
and
a
vague
light
indistinct
leafy
element
joins
the
crowd
these
flavours
are
though
all
a
bit
muted
under
the
fruityspicey
raisiny
alcohol
its
on
the
sweet
side
almost
cloying
but
not
quite
its
a
bit
frothy
and
gets
a
little
to
oily
at
the
finish
its
a
bit
on
the
balnd
side
but
has
some
nice
flavours
a
hint
of
complexity
and
fairly
good
balance
its
fairly
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
prickly
with
great
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
light
carbonation
combine
that
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
and
dryness
leaves
you
with
a
lovely
feeling
brew
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
abv
makes
an
appearance
here
and
there
but
doesnt
linger
anywhere
too
long
nor
does
it
ever
dominate
quite
high
on
my
drinkability
list
cant
drink
this
one
real
fast
just
look
at
the
abv
a
really
nice
take
on
an
imperial
oktoberfest
d
with
the
sweetness
and
heat
from
the
booze
this
isnt
very
drinkable
i
dont
really
want
more
than
the
3oz
pour
i
have
dthis
is
an
enjoyable
brew
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
with
a
10
03
abv
but
i
would
classify
this
more
as
a
barleywine
although
i
have
no
idea
what
an
imperial
marzen
is
supposed
to
be
i
didnt
know
such
an
animal
existed
my
first
sip
shocked
me
a
bit
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
this
savoring
the
next
few
sips
however
sealed
the
deal
i
wonder
what
this
will
taste
like
with
some
age
on
it
cant
wait
to
buy
some
more
celler
it
and
find
out
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
frothy
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
loads
of
burnt
caramel
malts
dried
fruits
and
slight
booze
the
beer
is
fairly
heavy
bodied
with
a
decent
boozy
alcohol
presence
but
a
warming
sipper
for
a
blustery
fall
day
this
one
won
gold
at
the
gabf
for
doppelbock
and
i
must
say
this
is
a
very
tasty
one
but
not
so
good
as
an
oktoberfest
even
if
you
call
it
imperial
time
to
change
the
label
t
the
big
abv
puts
a
small
dent
in
an
otherwise
good
effort
from
avery
not
the
best
value
especially
given
that
it
is
not
head
and
shoulders
above
the
best
nonimperial
marzen
it
is
pretty
unique
but
more
than
one
bomber
would
have
you
asleep
not
speaking
german
like
the
label
states
drinkability
tastes
excellent
but
high
abv
makes
this
bomber
more
than
enough
for
one
person
drinkability
is
alright
not
something
i
would
cellar
trade
for
buy
again
or
really
like
to
drink
anytime
soon
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
but
an
imperial
o
fest
does
nothing
for
me
other
than
a
quicker
buzz
somebody
had
to
do
it
and
i
guess
its
appropriate
for
avery
to
be
the
one
i
do
like
this
beer
but
a
marzen
im
not
sure
that
this
beer
fits
that
definition
more
like
an
imperial
lagered
brown
or
something
notes
nice
sturdy
larger
a
great
malty
example
im
not
sure
that
it
is
to
style
nor
that
it
matters
this
is
another
one
to
remember
avery
for
and
to
revisit
often
the
beer
is
quite
syrupy
not
cloyingly
so
but
syrupy
nonetheless
there
is
a
definite
honied
caramel
flavor
maybe
some
booze
soaked
florals
maybe
a
touch
of
the
boozy
pineapple
there
are
some
subdued
spicy
type
hops
this
beer
for
me
was
just
too
boozy
too
much
abv
throatiness
and
a
touch
medicinal
on
the
way
down
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
the
abv
had
a
leash
on
it
i
would
have
appreciated
the
beer
more
as
it
stands
the
beer
is
a
sipper
only
d
for
a
beer
this
strong
its
fairly
drinkable
but
toward
the
end
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
d
this
is
a
good
nightcap
beer
the
super
boozy
nature
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
im
definitely
glad
i
bought
it
but
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
the
malts
are
almost
too
sweet
for
me
but
it
is
cut
with
plenty
of
alcoholic
heat
hops
seem
to
do
very
little
to
balance
out
the
maltiness
the
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
in
this
beer
i
dont
really
see
a
need
to
imperialize
a
beer
style
that
is
known
for
its
ease
of
consumption
in
large
quantities
and
subtle
flavor
profile
its
ok
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
kaiser
pours
a
bright
amber
with
a
thin
lace
smell
is
a
solid
classic
marzen
caramel
pepper
dark
fruits
and
bread
the
taste
is
great
a
strong
malts
backbone
with
a
crisp
hops
finish
and
a
slight
but
satisfying
undercurrent
of
alcohol
this
is
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
marzens
and
the
only
imperial
oktoberfest
ive
had
delicious
drinkability
now
that
fall
is
in
the
air
this
is
a
perfect
seasonal
märzen
oktoberfest
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
abv
for
a
fallwinter
brew
d
just
a
couple
of
these
every
year
would
do
the
trick
for
me
a
little
too
much
on
the
alcohol
too
less
other
characteristics
for
me
i
guess
thats
why
its
considered
an
imperial
oktoberfest
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
though
it
was
now
called
a
double
oktoberfest
when
i
had
it
most
recently
and
that
was
exactly
how
id
characterize
it
very
good
and
perfect
for
the
fall
d
this
brew
does
not
mess
around
the
big
malt
structure
should
be
a
clue
to
its
strength
but
this
beer
is
so
wellcrafted
that
i
kept
taking
sip
after
sip
trying
to
figure
out
all
of
the
elusive
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
a
charcuterie
beer
to
be
sure
give
me
a
rustic
duck
pate
and
some
sweet
coppa
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
bomber
and
even
though
i
did
a
pretty
agressive
pour
i
got
very
little
head
not
even
one
finger
that
aside
the
color
is
a
crystal
clear
copper
its
smells
very
malty
and
it
is
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
malt
taste
and
candy
but
is
balanced
well
with
hops
its
very
thick
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
especially
for
a
lager
lots
of
caramel
and
toasted
wheat
bread
pours
a
nice
deep
auburn
with
light
tan
head
which
settles
fairly
quickly
the
deep
amber
is
very
nice
aroma
is
like
your
normal
oktoberfest
but
stronger
in
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
notes
sort
of
english
barleywineish
taste
is
strong
alcohol
on
top
of
normal
marzen
flavors
the
alcohol
really
is
at
the
forefront
taking
away
from
the
enjoyment
a
bit
toasty
biscuit
flavors
with
boozey
warmth
mouth
is
wellrounded
and
full
with
strong
alcohol
presence
smoother
in
carbonation
the
drink
overall
is
pretty
strong
in
alcohol
flavor
and
this
is
a
bit
unpleasant
also
im
not
sure
if
reffering
to
an
imperial
oktoberfest
less
than
100
years
after
ww2
is
a
great
idea
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
slightly
of
alcohol
and
a
lager
yeast
strain
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
up
front
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
though
quite
mild
and
some
spicy
earthy
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
rich
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
for
the
abv
is
very
good
i
plan
on
getting
this
again
it
is
essentially
what
the
label
states
a
double
strength
oktoberfest
and
a
damn
good
one
at
that
ddecent
but
after
one
of
the
22oz
i
really
didnt
want
anymore
d
while
i
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
interesting
i
really
think
it
would
be
better
suited
for
an
8
oz
serving
as
opposed
to
a
22oz
bomber
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
as
i
go
on
i
might
try
this
one
again
somewhere
down
the
road
but
i
would
definitely
want
to
have
a
couple
of
friends
around
to
share
d
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
after
a
couple
months
in
the
cellar
or
a
couple
years
to
see
if
some
of
the
hotness
dissapates
but
as
it
is
im
not
enthusiastic
about
another
one
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bodega
in
columbus
i
assume
its
a
fresh
12bbl
as
this
is
oktoberfest
season
and
it
definitely
earned
the
imperial
adjective
avery
placed
in
the
style
name
this
had
much
more
hops
than
usual
in
an
oktoberfest
magnum
sterling
tettnang
and
hersbrucker
lending
some
pungent
cone
aromas
and
a
delicious
but
slightly
bitter
flavor
to
the
extremely
strong
malt
base
the
malts
are
caramelly
and
biscuity
providing
excellent
counterbalance
for
averys
choice
of
hops
ive
passed
on
this
beer
for
the
past
several
oktoberfest
seasons
but
i
was
mistaken
to
do
so
this
is
a
top
shelf
lager
that
needs
to
be
hoarded
drinkability
is
ok
due
to
the
nice
smell
and
flavor
but
overall
this
is
not
one
that
youd
want
to
fill
a
couple
liters
of
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
exhibits
great
retention
good
malty
aroma
some
nice
hops
bitterness
and
some
indistinct
fruity
esters
taste
is
like
the
aroma
nice
malty
caramel
flavors
fruity
esters
apricot
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
some
alcohol
begins
to
come
through
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
as
this
warms
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
a
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
sticky
sensation
drinkability
is
ok
overall
i
found
this
beer

sweet

slight

overall
a

good
body
blend
and

final
thoughts
not
bad
for
an
oktoberfest
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
and
closer
to
a
strongold
ale
than
oktoberfest
not
as
much
hop
bitterness
as
i
expected
from
the
reputation
lots
of
dark
fruits
like
raisin
as
well
as
brown
sugar
some
earthy
bitterness
its
a
little
tough
to
drink
as
its
so
sweet
and
so
much
dark
fruits
but
otherwise
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
definately
like
this
beer
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
sure
but
as
a
warmup
for
oktoberfest
not
bad
at
all
and
not
much
out
there
to
compare
it
to
d
verdict
is
in
appearently
avery
can
make

well
executed

too
very
drinkable

this

abv
doesnt
overpower
for
that
number
this
is
one
i
would
recommend
and
have
again
had
this
one
the
other
day
with
my
father
poured
a
translucent
orange
copper
color
with
thin
white
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
almost
no
lacing
smelled
of
heavy
malts
light
fruits
and
yeast
tasted
the
same
with
some
mild
hops
smooth
just
a
tinge
overcarbed
could
definitely
drink
this
one
again
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
i
gotta
say
that
i
wont
buy
this
again
this
just
isnt
what
i
want
in
an
ofest
d
a
good
sipper
definitely
an
interesting
beer
from
avery
i
will
definitely
explore
avery
more
this
is
probably
great
for
malt
heads
and
while
i
was
interested
in
a
socalled
imperial
take
on
an
oktoberfest
this
just
didnt
work
for
me
i
could
only
take
about
12
the
bottle
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
pint
went
away
quickly
and
i
had
no
issues
with
that
i
have
to
say
that
beer
did
not
overly
impress
me
but
it
didnt
disappoint
me
either
i
guess
that
is
what
happens
when
you
go
in
with
no
expectations
not
a
bad
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
marzen
especially
make
one
this
big
still
has
the
marzen
blah
qualities
that
tend
to
leave
me
bored
at
times
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
should
you
be
a
fan
of
the
lagers
it
has
a
very
nice
level
of
sweet
and
bitter
and
is
quite
well
balanced
i
like
the
way
the
flavors
and
alcohol
work
together
and
would
have
it
again
should
it
be
available
really
this
level
of
alcohol
in
a
lager
puts
me
off
a
bit
as
does
the
insane
sweetness
you
get
kind
of
twists
some
of
the
best
qualities
of
an
oktoberfest
instead
of
enhancing
them
swing
and
a
miss
for
me

as

to

freaks
this
is
your
commander
bow
down
before
him
opinion
if
you
drink
the
oktoberfest
beers
primarily
you
will
probably
be
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
is
on
the
ragged
edge
of
being
in
this
style
it
is
a
good
example
of
an
experimental
style
and
this
is
how
you
should
approach
this
beer
dont
expect
a
stronger
paulaner
when
you
crack
the
top
off
of
this
one
but
they
warn
you
up
front
by
calling
it
an
imperial
oktoberfest
on
the
label
it
is
a
clean
and
wellpresented
beer
what
more
can
you
ask
for
for
it
to
fit
a
style
dead
nuts
the
color
is
ruby
amber
with
a
large
and
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
malt
aroma
not
really
any
stronger
than
a
standard
marzen
a
touch
of
spice
adds
a
bit
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
strong
caramel
malt
the
malt
flavor
is
very
similar
to
standard
ofests
just
a
little
thicker
a
mild
minty
hop
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
are
really
what
sets
this
apart
from
the
style
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
nearly
as
overthetop
or
strongflavored
as
expected
i
will
probably
be
sticking
with
the
more
sessionable
german
marzens
in
the
future
beautiful
copper
color
excelllent
malt
flavor
with
a
good
dose
of
german
hops
that
were
balanced
without
being
too
spicy
simply
a
wonderful
oktoberfest
with
high
octane
alcohol
very
present
on
the
nose
alcohol
in
the
mouthfeel
as
well
but
no
too
overwhelming
i
shared
this
big
bottle
with
a
friend
and
agreed
it
to
be
choice
cheers
joe
moderate
to
full
mouthfeel
that
leaves
slight
oils
i
like
this
beer
while
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
this
particular
beer
struck
me
as
an
american
bw
made
with
german
ingredients
boy
those
silly
americans
are
having
a
lot
to
fun
with
beer
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
of
a
marzen
and
octoberfest
the
aggression
in
the
alcohol
hops
and
sugar
sources
completely
dominate
the
biscuity
cloying
and
cleanliness
of
the
original
styles
it
has
nice
caramel
and
barley
malts
in
the
nose
and
flavor
sweet
alcohol
overtakes
the
flavors
afterwards
maybe
some
honey
and
spices
present
but
they
are
small
sweet
ripe
fruit
flavors
tangerines
grapes
and
mangos
a
little
more
estery
from
late
hop
additions
than
i
expected
its
a
neat
beer
not
evident
of
style
but
too
drinkable
to
rate
low
not
bad
but
not
great
all
in
all
i
think
id
rather
have
a
doppelbock
or
eisbock
given
the
alcoholic
hit
that
it
delivers
still
and
enjoyable
bock
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldorange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
is
breadlike
and
toastey
it
boasts
of
pale
light
crystal
bisquit
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
warm
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
light
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
is
toastey
with
a
nice
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
love
the
concept
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
a
good
drinker
pours
a
deep
and
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
very
thin
white
head
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
raisins
and
figs
and
some
spicy
hop
notes
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
dried
fruits
and
rum
slightly
cloying
with
a
fair
amount
of
spicy
hops
and
quite
a
bit
too
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
which
made
it
difficult
to
finish

mouthfeel

very
nice
low

good
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
a
bit
syrupy
with
good
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
easily
drinkable
except
for
the
slight
alcohol
sting
a
bomber
goes
down
with
no
problem
and
works
well
on
a
nice
day
if
you
enjoy
the
oktoberfest
style
this
one
is
worth
a
try
despite
the
rich
flavor
and
the
abv
im
finding
this
one
very
drinkable
my
first
imperial
oktoberfest
a
great
style
many
thanks
to
brent
for
sending
this
one
along
drinkability
have
to
say
that
the
combination
of
high
alcohol
and
oktoberfest
flavors
didnt
cut
it
for
me
just
didnt
blend
together
very
well
drinkability
a
few
of
these
around
an
october
firepit
and
youll
be
warm
inside
and
out
another
one
for
the
next
halloween
party
tasting
this
is
a
special
treat
for
me
easy
to
enjoy
this
should
appeal
to
a
wide
variety

the

this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
but
i
am
not
convinced
it
is
deserving
of
slapping
an
imperial
tag
on
it
just
because
there
is
more
alcohol
in
it
when
i
first
heard
of
this
beer
it
made
me
stumble
mentally
a
bit
a
marzen
is
one
of
the
last
beers
i
would
expect
to
get
the
imperial
treatment
i
poured
this
beer
out
of
its
neatly
labeled
22oz
bottle
into
a
glass
tumbler
the
body
is
a
deep
combination
of
ruby
and
orange
and
nearly
perfectly
translucent
a
sticky
tan
head
steams
up
radidly
but
recedes
rather
quickly
as
well
to
a
clingy
coating
about
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
a
thin
greasy
layer
on
top
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
festbiers
ive
seen
to
date
the
nose
is
very
rich
with
malts
luxorious
and
velvetty
my
nose
is
dominated
by
fruity
and
caramelly
flavors
so
fruity
in
fact
that
it
makes
me
doubt
the
fact
that
this
beer
truly
uses
a
lager
yeast
tiny
hints
of
spicy
eurohop
peep
through
the
thick
curtains
of
malt
as
i
take
a
sip
i
notice
the
luscious
velvetty
mouthfeel
a
little
thick
for
a
marzen
but
i
enjoy
it
nonetheless
caramel
blends
with
sharp
fruity
flavors
caramel
dipped
pears
comes
to
mind
again
a
bit
out
of
character
the
finish
is
biting
with
spicy
hops
and
phenolic
punch
i
do
actually
pick
up
on
tones
of
muted
lager
yeast
flavors
which
confuses
me
a
bit
this
beers
warms
my
throat
up
quickly
and
as
i
sip
i
can
feel
it
working
its
way
to
my
head
already
stylistically
id
have
to
say
this
beer
is
out
of
character
however
i
think
its
damn
good
styles
be
damned
anyway
i
know
im
enjoying
it
a
little
late
in
the
season
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
accompaniment
to
chili
and
fritos
fine
dining
at
its
best
as
it
is
this
is
way
out
of
the
ordinary
but
ive
come
to
expect
that
roll
with
the
punches
and
this
is
enjoyable
enough
taste
was
a
big
hit
of
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
very
balanced
hop
dry
finish
i
thought
the
alcohol
hit
at
the
very
end
but
was
well
blended
in
as
it
wamred
the
alcohol
came
out
a
touch
more
but
was
still
very
pleasant
to
me
it
seemed
dangerously
drinkable
all
in
all
a
very
enojyable
brew
with
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hop
that
i
would
certainly
purchase
again
poured
a
copper
with
nice
tight
head
malt
and
citric
hops
vied
for
dominance
with
the
caramel
of
the
malt
rising
and
falling
back
alcohol
had
a
raw
edge
in
the
flavor
profile
the
beer
was
enjoyable
but
not
one
that
goes
in
a
repeat
lineup
well
worth
trying
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
by
any
means
i
think
it
would
do
much
better
without
the
exagerated
alcohol
content
as
it
distracts
from
its
fine
ofest
qualities
price
tag
a
bit
steep
as
well
a
yearly
distraction
is
fine
for
me
shared
a
22oz
with
a
beer
buddy
of
mine
in
pa
pours
a
crystal
clear
amberred
with
a
thin
bonewhite
head
aroma
is
very
malty
and
sweet
smells
like
an
octoberfest
all
the
way
taste
is
initially
malty
bready
and
sweet
followed
by
a
nice
dose
of
german
hops
finished
is
rough
due
to
the
extreme
alcohol
tatse
not
balanced
at
all
thr
alcohol
is
not
well
integrated
into
the
beer
it
just
stands
out
too
much
its
strange
to
here
these
words
come
out
of
my
mouth
cuz
i
love
strong
beers
its
all
i
drink
some
might
really
enjoy
this
brew
alas
i
did
not
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
off
white
head
that
falls
and
laces
well
aroma
is
lots
of
malt
caramel
with
light
hop
and
spice
aromas
mixed
thru
out
taste
of
lots
of
malt
very
big
bodied
oktoberfest
creamy
with
lots
of
caramel
malty
goddness
abounding
finishes
with
noticable
alcohol
presence
that
brings
the
spiciness
and
hops
to
the
front
this
is
a
very
big
oktoberfest
that
was
quite
a
treat
only
draw
back
was
the
noticable
alcohol
flavor
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
full
nice
and
creamy
brew
drinkability
was
good
i
would
not
mind
to
have
this
in
the
future
want
to
thank
melin48
for
sharing
it
with
me
better
than
expected
and
definitely
an
unusual
take
on
the
style
you
can
certainly
sense
and
feel
the
high
abv
here
but
its
nicely
done
and
pleasantly
drinkable
overall
not
having
had
an
imperial
oktoberfest
i
can
vouch
that
this
badboy
indeed
deserves
its
title
and
is
not
a
dopplebock
as
i
perhaps
expected
just
like
its
other
highgravity
cousins
this
is
also
a
winner
but
cmon
lets
be
honest
the
salvation
kicks
ass
all
solicitation
aside
these
guys
remain
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
the
warm
welcome
i
received
at
the
brewery
proves
that
these
guys
are
deeply
passionate
about
their
beer
and
good
beer
in
general
drinkability
boozier
than
a
bock
but
not
as
darkly
malty
as
a
doublebock
resembled
a
brown
ale
in
flavor
looked
like
an
americanized
marzen
reminiscent
of
a
dead
guy
actually
not
certain
if
i
like
this
experiment
its
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
gaga
over
history
tells
me
bad
things
tend
to
happen
when
germans
get
imperial
aspirations
thankfully
this
bucked
the
trend
beautiful
crimson
in
hue
with
influences
of
tawnycopper
tiny
bubbles
were
noticed
in
the
clear
liquid
the
animation
was
lively
and
raced
quickly
to
the
offwhite
head
the
froth
was
two
fingers
in
height
at
the
apex
impressive
head
retention
was
very
good
the
majority
of
the
foamy
mass
lasted
for
a
long
while
a
tight
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
subsequent
lacing
was
sticky
very
widespread
and
organized
this
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
looking
ofests
ive
seen
the
nose
was
cleaner
than
i
thought
it
would
be
malt
was
the
focal
point
it
was
sweet
and
very
wide
but
it
encompasses
a
very
limited
range
that
covers
caramel
and
chocolate
covered
toffee
hints
of
dark
fruit
cherries
mainly
maybe
some
candied
red
apples
suggestions
of
grain
some
earthy
hops
but
the
spicy
grass
aromas
are
more
noticeable
there
are
only
weak
indications
of
alcohol
the
potency
is
moderate
and
i
did
have
to
work
at
it
a
bit
to
smell
everything
but
i
was
rewarded
i
liked
the
bouquet
inviting
the
palate
is
not
quite
as
refined
and
articulate
as
the
nose
suggested
i
am
disappointed
still
the
beer
has
some
merits
i
dont
believe
this
beer
is
really
an
ofest
it
is
a
doppelbock
also
the
imperial
label
is
very
lame
summits
oktoberfest
clocks
in
at
7
70
abv
and
it
is
much
more
refined
plus
it
doesnt
bullshit
us
into
believing
it
is
a
new
style
hey
avery
lay
off
the
marketing
and
just
make
good
beer
can
you
do
that
upfront
the
beer
is
malty
fairly
sweet
and
mostly
caramel
with
just
hints
of
apples
too
in
the
middle
there
is
noticeable
suggestions
of
grain
biscuits
earthy
hops
and
some
spicy
grass
so
far
the
palate
is
pleasant
and
tasty
simple
it
is
straightforward
and
well
rounded
only
if
this
beer
didnt
have
a
finish
because
this
sucker
turns
hot
it
is
way
too
raw
i
mean
cant
they
hide
the
alcohol
the
finish
is
home
to
the
cherries
and
toffee
fusel
rocket
fuel
jesus
im
breathing
fire
here
this
beer
is
beating
the
shit
out
of
my
brain
it
is
way
too
harsh
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
unpleasantly
bitter
once
this
beer
is
boiled
down
to
the
basics
it
really
isnt
than
complex
or
special
and
then
you
factor
in
the
alcohol
rawness
and
what
is
the
point
really
basically
this
beer
is
a
malt
liquor
lager
easy
to
drink
if
its
your
thing
for
me
not
so
much
as
i
find
it
pointless
i
need
some
food
if
i
going
to
finish
this
bomber
somewhere
around
medium
in
body
moderate
but
appropriate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
little
slick
and
kind
of
oily
and
yeah
hot
i
was
shocked
when
i
saw
a
bomber
of
this
in
brookfield
wi
i
gladly
forked
over
the
6
00
in
hindsight
i
have
to
ask
why
was
i
so
enthused
it
is
drinkable
sure
i
can
finish
the
bottle
but
i
dont
need
to
drink
it
again
i
can
see
why
some
people
like
this
but
for
me
it
is
not
very
well
brewed
give
me
less
alcohol
and
more
malt
and
you
have
winner
here
i
say
it
is
still
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
decent
poured
a
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
creamy
head
i
do
have
to
say
of
the
beers
i
have
had
the
re
of
the
amber
color
this
is
the
best
looking
of
them
all
aroma
hops
fruity
citus
leaning
to
the
orange
floral
as
it
start
to
warm
hints
of
lemon
and
the
alcohol
comes
out
flavor
malts
orange
hints
of
grapefruit
and
the
alcohol
comes
out
just
right
and
it
just
adds
to
the
good
flavors
of
this
good
beer
22oz
bomber
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
orangishamber
color
there
was
only
a
little
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
caramel
malt
nose
also
hints
of
alcohol
spices
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
some
alcohol
coming
through
also
some
evidence
of
fruits
and
spices
good
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
i
agree
that
this
could
age
a
bit
to
smooth
it
out
i
am
sorry
that
i
could
not
get
more
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
highly
desireabvle
i
wasnt
sure
of
this
whe
i
got
but
boy
am
i
sold
malt
was
very
much
up
front
with
just
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
overly
sweet
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
peeked
through
in
this
9
8
abv
brew
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
and
not
over
the
top
as
i
expected
look
forward
to
my
next
one
and
will
make
it
an
annual
purchase
great
example
of
the
octoberfest
style
taken
a
notch
up
big
malty
nose
thick
textured
mouthfeel
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
followed
by
some
pleasing
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
drinkable
despite
its
stregnth
pleasurable
in
every
way
drinkability
this
beer
is
big
and
bold
although
i
dont
think
its
as
unique
as
avery
thinks
it
is
it
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
a
great
fall
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
sounded
too
interesting
to
pass
up
since
an
imperial
oktoberfest
is
not
something
you
come
across
every
day
22oz
bottle
with
a
picture
of
a
kaiser
on
the
front
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
body
with
a
tall
off
white
head
nice
rings
of
lace
were
left
decorating
the
glass
as
i
drank
this
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bready
smell
masked
the
alcohol
almost
completely
here
still
not
a
very
complex
smell
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
palette
along
with
a
warming
alcohol
presence
a
bit
of
a
spicy
sweet
after
taste
lingers
around
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
almost
full
definitely
the
thickest
of
the
style
i
have
had
drinkability
was
fairly
good
this
is
not
where
near
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
this
is
one
i
enjoyed
i
would
say
give
it
a
shot
if
you
come
across
this
pours
with
a
thick
and
lacy
ivory
head
settling
upon
clear
deep
copperyamber
liquid
a
sweet
and
heavy
malty
candyish
nose
tempered
by
lots
of
floral
hop
aroma
thick
mouthfeel
supports
flavors
of
apple
breadlike
maltiness
a
powpowpowerful
hopping
and
a
blast
of
alcoholic
heat
the
super
long
alcohol
hop
show
finish
ends
with
alcohol
felt
in
the
throat
wow
i
found
this
one
to
be
an
impressive
take
on
the
marzen
style
surely
not
for
the
timid
of
palate
wish
it
were
available
by
the
six
pack
the
new
glow
appeal
of
this
beer
has
definitely
faded
for
me
now
that
i
have
finished
half
a
glass
the
beer
just
seems
a
bit
too
harsh
and
unbalanced
i
definitely
recommend
aging
this
for
quite
a
while
i
have
two
more
bottles
which
i
will
perhaps
try
again
in
the
spring
there
is
potential
with
your
brewery
but
it
is
nearly
always
forsaken
in
the
quest
to
churn
out
higheroctane
headline
makers
the
envelope
needs
to
be
pushed
in
the
direction
of
craft
not
strength
solid
malt
base
to
the
aroma
with
a
chunk
of
floral
hops
pale
cream
colored
head
is
fine
in
texture
leaving
patches
of
lace
as
it
fades
to
a
film
island
transparent
cranberry
orange
beer
with
a
few
traces
of
lethargic
carbonation
malt
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
but
begins
to
fade
as
the
alcohol
kicks
in
towards
the
end
body
is
on
the
light
side
sweet
malty
alcohol
taste
was
pretty
nice
at
first
and
continued
to
grow
on
my
throughout
the
beer
i
love
avery
and
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
out
22oz
bottle
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
caramel
and
hops
are
apparent
in
the
aroma
smells
a
little
sweet
too
very
sweet
in
the
flavor
caramel
and
grassy
with
some
alcohol
as
well
normally
oktoberfest
isnt
my
thing
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
it
again
clear
copper
in
color
frothy
white
lacing
up
front
only
to
ring
the
glass
later
some
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
are
very
sweet
with
a
smattering
of
citrus
hops
flavor
is
different
its
tough
to
picture
what
an
imperial
ofest
should
taste
like
but
this
one
just
felt
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
not
balanced
by
the
miniscule
hop
levels
slight
harshness
from
the
alcohol
finishes
with
a
lot
of
residual
sweetness
thick
on
the
palate
drinkabilty
suffers
due
to
the
harshness
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
just
not
one
id
eagerly
seek
out
again
ng
damn
this
tastes
rather
like
a
german
ofest
or
maybe
spaten
optimator
big
malty
aroma
and
flavor
munich
notes
everywhere
rich
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
so
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
big
but
overall
the
palate
is
smooth
and
mellow
clean
finish
i
am
impressed
with
the
drinkability
of
this
at
over
9
i
was
intrigued
by
this
big
scary
bottle
while
i
was
at
liquormart
last
month
so
i
bought
it
pours
a
shiny
yellowishamber
with
a
mediumsized
light
khaki
head
smells
of
biscuits
that
have
been
marinating
in
honey
and
corn
syrup
overnight
lots
of
sugar
i
notice
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
too
taste
whew
now
thats
sweet
the
kaiser
wastes
no
time
in
letting
me
know
that
he
has
a
heart
of
pure
sugarcough
syrup
slight
biscuit
flavors
are
quickly
and
rudely
shoved
aside
by
melted
pixy
stix
and
alcohol
luckily
some
bitter
almost
astringent
hops
kick
in
at
about
the
same
time
and
tame
the
sweetness
a
touch
still
too
cloyingly
sweet
to
drink
much
big
cloying
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
how
im
gonna
finish
the
entire
22
oz
bottle
drinkability
is
solid
the
aroma
and
flavor
start
strong
but
just
get
overpowered
by
jet
fuel
tone
it
down
a
bit
and
i
bet
this
is
a
good
beer
i
seem
to
be
in
the
minority
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
for
the
most
part
this
beer
pours
a
deep
red
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
full
of
sweet
coton
candyish
malts
alcohol
and
earthy
hops
wow
the
alcohol
is
up
front
and
in
my
face
the
malts
are
nice
and
roasty
staying
on
my
tongue
along
with
just
a
bit
of
a
hop
to
balance
them
out
this
is
a
good
tasting
lager
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
as
i
would
expect
from
this
monster
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
the
aftertaste
keeps
me
wanting
more
so
ill
go
till
this
is
done
thanks
to
clvand0
for
bringing
this
one
over
imperial
octoberfest
this
is
either
a
bad
idea
or
a
mediocre
idea
poorly
executed
pass
it
by
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
bready
spicy
candy
like
aroma
fruity
caramel
and
nutty
flavors
full
bodied
with
a
thick
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
finishes
sweet
more
like
a
dopplebock
than
an
oktoberfest
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
22
ounce
bottle
appears
a
nice
copper
hue
like
one
would
expect
a
typical
octoberfest
to
look
like
smells
quite
malty
and
that
smell
translates
to
taste
this
is
one
malty
beer
but
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
backed
up
by
hops
with
no
problem
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
and
a
good
shot
at
an
octoberfest
on
steroids
good
job
avery
keep
up
the
good
work
slick
oily
pour
with
a
nice
orangesienna
hue
holding
a
twofingered
beige
head
the
smell
of
caramel
nuts
hops
and
some
alcohol
lingering
in
the
nose
bitter
hops
pleasently
mixed
exceptionally
with
sweet
lingering
malts
hiding
the
big
9
3
abv
dont
get
fooled
by
its
subtlty
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
velevety
texture
it
leaves
a
little
of
itself
behind
after
every
drink
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
from
avery
and
probably
one
of
my
favorites
unfortunately
this
is
limited
so
ill
have
to
grab
another
very
soon
deep
copperred
color
with
a
huge
yet
short
lived
cap
of
coarse
foam
high
abv
surely
contributes
to
the
rapidly
diminishing
head
but
it
laces
a
bit
and
leaves
a
thin
film
to
soldier
on
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
with
black
cherry
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
sneaking
in
flavor
is
almost
like
a
doppelbock
with
powdery
cocoa
toffee
and
a
bitterness
strong
enough
to
cut
the
sweetness
but
not
overshadow
the
subtleties
of
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
for
a
big
beer
with
lots
of
alcohol
thick
enough
to
ensure
you
pace
yourself
but
not
syrupy
this
beer
speaks
softly
but
carries
a
big
stick
you
miss
the
abv
till
its
too
late
great
beer
great
name
a
nice
offering
from
avery
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
still
pretty
damn
good
these
guys
make
big
beers
that
are
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
before
the
fall
is
over
the
beer
after
it
disemboguing
from
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
resides
temporarily
in
my
glass
a
limpid
luminous
brown
with
a
behemothic
creamy
light
tan
head
that
erodes
leaving
a
thick
blanket
of
lace
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
malt
dominated
sweet
and
fresh
to
the
senses
start
is
sweet
with
a
delectable
malt
profile
and
the
top
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
strikingly
acidic
the
hops
determined
in
their
spicy
bite
with
the
aftertaste
decidedly
dry
another
magnificent
beer
from
one
of
my
top
ten
breweries
and
a
fantastic
label
my
kudos
to
the
great
people
at
avery
once
again
i
wanted
to
like
this
i
like
avery
beers
but
this
one
like
the
beast
disappointed
me
too
much
alcohol
too
over
the
top
dundee
oktoberfest
brewed
by
genesee
brewing
co
dundee
brewing
co
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
50
when
dundee
oktoberfest
pours
out
it
is
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
sweetness
and
spices
you
also
pick
up
on
some
grains
and
malts
in
the
smell
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
you
pick
up
on
the
spices
and
malts
dundee
oktoberfest
has
a
smooth
taste
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
i
though
there
would
be
more
to
this
brew
but
it
is
ok
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
in
this
brew
more
spices
and
flavors
for
what
it
worth
this
is
mild
oktoberfest
but
it
is
good
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
with
no
bad
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
is
and
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
not
bad
at
all
well
nothing
special
either
i
had
low
expectations
but
found
the
beer
reasonably
tasty
certainly
much
better
than
the
regular
quantity
beer
the
cost
of
4
a
six
certainly
helps
the
score
o
its
got
potential
but
needs
more
of
whats
there
decent
small
town
us
take
on
the
oktoberfestmärzen
style
beer
overall
nice
little
octoberfest
o
my
own
minioktoberfest
consisted
of
a
blind
sidebysidebyside
tasting
of
oktoberfests
by
sam
adams
saranac
and
dundee
surprisingly
dundee
fared
the
best
of
the
three
im
not
very
well
versed
in
oktoberfests
but
dundee
was
more
complex
and
simply
stood
out
as
something
special
the
flavor
has
some
subtle
caramel
elements
of
malt
with
a
nice
clean
yeast
flavor
with
slight
woody
hop
accent
however
the
flavor
seems
muted
and
not
as
malt
forward
as
it
could
be
the
taste
has
a
gentle
toasted
grain
flavor
which
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
overall
the
fest
is
pretty
standard
by
the
numbers
good
but
not
exceptional
i
would
drink
this
again
but
it
isnt
worth
seeking
out
o
you
cold
do
worse
but
you
cant
do
worse
for
the
money
o
not
great
for
the
style
but
not
undrinkable
lacks
depth
of
flavors
though
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
the
last
ofest
ive
got
not
sure
if
im
pleased
with
this
fact
or
not
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
auburnbronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
sourdough
toffee
and
a
kiss
of
greens
the
taste
holds
notes
of
very
sweet
caramel
light
candied
orange
peel
dry
bran
and
brown
grass
its
a
strange
dichotomy
on
my
tongue
between
the
sweet
and
the
drygrainy
that
luckily
moves
in
shifts
rather
than
just
sitting
poorly
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
a
decent
ofest
but
nothing
to
get
anywhere
near
excited
about
first
brew
from
dundee
and
i
like
it
a
better
take
on
the
style
than
some
of
the
better
craft
breweries
out
there
a
great
price
point
for
a
good
oktoberfest
i
will
seek
out
again
o
i
like
this
oktoberfest
its
more
rich
and
malty
than
some
with
a
great
mouthfeel
nice
take
on
the
style
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
example
of
the
style
ive
had
others
from
brewers
with
a
bigger
rep
than
this
and
they
werent
as
good
a
good
effort
from
dundee
me
thinks
i
sampled
this
beer
along
with
two
other
similar
choices
shock
top
pumpkin
wheat
and
sierra
nevada
tumbler
and
it
seemed
thin
and
devoid
of
taste
or
flavor
i
really
expected
to
like
it
more
but
was
left
disappointed
the
color
and
appearance
was
good
the
taste
was
not
i
love
this
beer
cant
wait
for
this
comes
out
everything
about
this
beer
means
fall
one
taste
and
i
fell
like
im
in
the
woods
walking
on
leaves
crunching
them
with
every
step
the
beer
is
cool
and
crisp
and
makes
me
feel
good
all
a
perfect
beer
in
a
glasss
so
enjoy
a
beer
this
beer
i
know
i
do
the
feel
is
light
and
leans
more
toward
crispness
than
smoothness
with
a
bit
more
than
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
bad
ive
had
better
oktoberfest
beers
but
this
was
worth
a
try
o
this
one
is
on
the
same
level
as
the
sam
adams
version
for
sure
will
be
fun
to
drink
throughout
the
season
can
you
say
grilled
brats
o
id
have
to
have
a
taste
test
but
right
there
as
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
lot
different
than
most
of
the
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
almost
like
a
different
style
its
not
bad
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
overall
october
is
well
in
the
rearview
mirror
but
i
had
been
saving
a
few
ofest
beers
waiting
for
the
right
time
to
review
them
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
a
very
approachable
oktoberfest
beer
one
to
introduce
a
person
to
the
style
i
will
likely
look
for
this
again
next
year
o
looks
good
tastes
alright
but
overall
subpar
a
fairly
onedimensional
profile
lacks
a
little
in
complexity
and
balance
not
bad
for
the
price
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
beer
i
liked
this
and
at
5
996er
the
price
is
great
pretty
one
dimensional
with
the
sweet
malt
dominating
pretty
much
everything
but
the
sweetness
works
and
i
find
myself
wanting
another
one
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
perhaps
not
the
traditional
german
marzen
but
certainly
worth
a
try
o
this
beer
looks
amazing
and
smells
so
good
the
feel
is
really
great
too
too
bad
the
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
other
than
that
pretty
solid
oktoberfest
i
preferred
this
over
the
spaten
overall
not
a
half
bad
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
well
pours
a
nice
ruby
chestnut
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
creates
alot
of
sticky
slime
smells
of
nutty
malts
spice
and
caramel
with
a
faint
grainy
lager
type
smell
strong
robust
malty
backbone
with
an
almost
fruity
center
followed
up
with
a
sour
grain
finish
light
on
the
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
worth
buying
imo
esp
for
the
price
it
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
lager
o
not
a
great
beer
nor
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
not
unpleasant
either
sallright
poured
with
a
nice
sized
foamy
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
settled
down
to
a
few
islands
quickly
and
no
lace
color
is
a
lovely
clear
cherry
copper
amber
aroma
is
malt
toffee
caramel
a
bit
of
fruit
and
roast
flavor
is
less
interesting
than
nose
the
same
stuff
just
less
intense
or
interesting
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
a
touch
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
and
on
the
short
side
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
unless
youre
tight
on
money
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
marzen
overall
i
was
alot
more
impressed
than
i
thought
really
good
beer
will
buy
again
cheers
overall
not
bad
at
all
great
session
brew
i
thought
it
was
phenomenal
a
few
years
ago
but
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
good
oktoberfests
are
getting
mundane
im
looking
at
you
sam
adams
and
leinenkugel
oh
well
worth
a
sixer
for
sure
pours
dark
reddish
amber
with
large
white
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
bread
crust
slight
medicinal
notes
and
hazelnut
tastes
of
hazelnut
bread
some
spice
malty
sweetness
and
clean
hop
presence
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
beer
worth
skipping
over
overall
a
by
the
numbers
marzen
that
adds
up
and
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
overall
drinkability
best
ive
had
in
the
style
overall
to
be
honest
the
only
reason
i
picked
this
up
was
because
i
was
craving
an
oktoberfest
and
it
was
5
99
a
sixpack
i
was
expecting
mediocrity
at
best
i
was
actually
a
bit
surprised
this
is
light
on
intensity
both
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
flavorsaromas
that
are
there
are
enjoyable
and
styleappropriate
i
would
not
buy
this
regularly
but
at
6
or
7
bucks
id
pick
this
up
from
time
to
time
for
sure
o
not
worth
the
purchase
if
it
wasnt
for
the
lightness
probably
wouldnt
have
finished
this
is
probably
the
worst
oktoberfest
ive
ever
had
its
a
damn
shame
too
i
look
very
forward
to
the
fall
season
because
i
find
the
beers
to
be
among
some
of
the
best
at
that
time
of
the
year
this
was
just
a
major
upset
here
there
was
an
ok
looking
color
to
it
but
very
thin
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
where
did
all
the
seasonings
go
mouthfeel
drinkability
i
can
barely
get
this
down
without
gagging
the
mouthfeel
is
just
unbearably
unpleasant
i
think
that
after
drinking
five
of
these
im
finally
going
to
give
up
on
this
brew
and
chuck
the
last
one
into
the
trashcan
perhaps
i
will
try
a
different
dundee
brew
in
the
future
but
this
is
just
ridiculously
gross
redcopper
in
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
is
partially
diminishing
aroma
is
primarily
toffee
with
some
raw
wood
sawdust
and
something
i
can
only
liken
to
american
cheese
singles
lightly
sour
moderately
sweet
flavor
rather
high
in
haystraw
graininess
sour
grain
and
sourdough
bread
finish
that
is
quite
long
lasting
ive
had
better
oktoberfests
very
welldone
and
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
good
bargain
for
a
craftstyle
beer
verdict
a
decent
choice
thus
far
for
oktoberfests
flavor
is
pretty
bold
and
peppery
not
bad
its
worth
a
shot
when
fall
comes
back
around
so
get
it
next
year
c
3
15
di
wouldnt
search
it
out
again
but
in
a
pinch
itll
do
d
a
good
marzen
dreally
a
pretty
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
not
great
but
a
solid
example
overallaverage
octoberfest
does
the
job
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
no
major
issues
though
this
beer
poured
with
a
thick
2
finger
head
good
retention
finish
was
clean
with
a
copperamber
color
the
nose
is
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
confirmed
to
be
a
sweet
maltlike
flavor
with
a
slight
finish
of
hop
carbonation
is
moderate
but
the
beer
feels
a
bit
heavy
definitely
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
seems
a
bit
too
sweet
there
are
so
many
better
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
recommend
this
one
it
is
cheap
though
dundees
oktoberfest
12oz
into
0
4l
alsace
fischers
tulip
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
copper
hues
a
nice
1
12
bone
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
then
recedes
into
a
thin
film
which
remains
throughout
the
drink
smells
of
sweet
pale
and
caramel
malts
lightly
roasted
malts
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
grain
drink
is
medium
carbonated
tastes
of
caramel
malt
a
little
biscuit
and
a
slight
hint
of
red
grape
somewhat
sweet
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
after
not
cloying
but
pleasant
overall
a
good
rendition
of
the
oktoberfest
style
but
all
in
all
not
one
to
write
home
about
i
picked
up
a
6pk
for
5
99
on
sale
so
that
price
not
a
bad
buy
i
recommend
pairing
this
brew
with
pan
seared
pork
chops
seasoned
only
with
a
dash
of
salt
and
pepper
cheers
this
brew
is
not
on
par
with
better
examples
of
the
style
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
color
is
a
moderate
copperamber
with
a
light
tan
head
not
too
much
retention
or
lacing
on
this
one
the
aroma
is
a
bit
faint
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hops
as
well
as
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
brings
a
bit
of
caramel
as
well
as
some
slightlytoasted
bread
feel
is
a
bit
light
but
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
and
easy
sipper
middleoftheroad
but
itll
do
the
job
in
a
pinch
this
was
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
or
seen
of
dundees
oktoberfest
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
it
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
thick
head
of
foam
the
scent
is
not
very
strong
but
it
has
a
very
full
flavor
that
drinks
very
smooth
this
is
perhaps
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
thus
far
a
must
try
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
amber
color
and
was
only
docked
points
because
of
the
near
complete
lack
of
headretention
that
being
said
the
beer
tasted
very
malty
and
wasnt
lacking
in
carbonation
it
has
an
almost
sour
taste
along
with
the
crystal
malt
flavor
it
is
very
typical
for
the
style
but
is
well
done
and
as
such
for
the
price
is
as
good
of
a
marzen
as
you
could
find
very
drinkable
and
nice
mouthfeel
certainly
is
smooth
enough
solid
example
of
the
octoberfest
style
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
subtle
tone
of
spice
not
strong
but
still
inviting
it
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
malty
with
hints
of
spice
and
could
that
be
pumpkin
texture
is
smooth
a
little
tingly
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
still
acceptable
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
not
the
worst
its
average
thats
the
best
description
id
get
it
again
if
there
was
no
other
offering
d
its
pretty
decent
however
in
a
style
know
for
high
drinkability
this
one
isnt
quite
there
while
i
like
my
oktoberfests
on
the
bold
and
malty
side
this
ones
almost
too
sweet
all
said
its
pretty
cost
friendly
something
id
probably
pick
up
when
im
a
little
lighter
in
the
pocketbook
surprisingly
solid
no
complaints
except
for
the
out
of
whack
carbonation
id
buy
a
6pack
of
this
especially
at
the
price
about
7
i
think
clean
and
crisp
drinkabilty
a
definite
session
beer
db
not
bad
at
all
right
down
the
middle
for
the
style
does
its
job
with
the
fall
feeling
and
has
a
refreshing
flavor
drinkability
goodtasting
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
drank
easy
enough
i
would
pick
a
sixer
of
this
up
before
i
would
most
of
the
ofests
ive
had
this
fall
to
include
sam
adams
left
hand
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
d
definitely
a
fall
beer
enjoyable
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
definitely
drinkable
with
a
meal
or
by
itself
d
very
desent
beer
that
i
do
look
forward
to
having
a
few
every
year
maybe
not
the
best
of
this
variety
but
definitly
a
keeper
overall
a
great
smelling
oktoberfest
that
actually
looked
good
until
the
head
quickly
eroded
to
nothing
a
weird
acrid
spiciness
workedover
my
palate
pretty
quickly
and
that
did
not
please
me
id
rather
drink
this
with
some
sausages
and
strong
mustard
kraut
than
drink
alone
d
this
is
beer
screams
fall
and
it
very
enjoyable
while
it
isnt
anything
special
it
is
a
solid
octoberfest
drinkability
eh
its
a
one
and
doner
d
for
a
beginner
this
might
not
be
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
its
a
fine
beer
to
drink
after
a
long
hard
days
work
in
the
fall
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
season
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
a
crappy
ofest
overall
the
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
but
not
what
i
would
expect
for
an
ocktoberfest
definately
would
drink
again
but
would
like
to
see
it
with
a
bit
more
hop
taste
d
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
oktoberfest
i
would
certainly
have
another
but
would
not
seek
it
out
exclusively
d
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
very
enjoyable
it
really
hits
the
spot
and
makes
an
excellent
first
oktoberfest
of
the
season
overall
i
was
very
underimpressed
with
this
beer
ontap
at
clarks
ale
house
for
3
50
a
pint
appeared
a
clear
orange
with
a
short
white
head
like
the
other
dundee
beers
this
is
a
simple
but
tasty
drink
theres
a
dry
but
sweet
caramel
taste
that
dominates
with
light
candied
bread
undertones
clean
and
drinkable
im
sure
its
a
fine
beer
to
drink
a
stein
of
cheers
d
not
a
bad
maerzen
leans
a
little
too
far
to
the
sweet
side
for
me
though
deep
amber
in
color
off
white
head
quickly
falls
leaving
lacing
in
its
place
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
toasted
grain
sweet
spiciness
as
well
i
smell
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
crazy
i
know
taste
is
caramel
sweetness
up
front
gives
way
to
grainybready
sweetness
some
bittering
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
easy
drinking
octoberfest
not
the
greatest
but
certainly
not
bad
and
at
5
99
a
six
pack
you
cant
go
wrong
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
its
a
bit
sweet
worth
a
try
good
flavor
what
what
its
worth
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
d
a
fine
oktoberfest
not
the
first
one
i
would
choose
but
would
never
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
many
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
this
beer
is
not
my
type
of
octoberfest
dundee
doesnt
seem
to
be
able
to
make
a
beer
to
the
style
it
is
malty
but
nothing
seems
to
match
up
here
i
cannot
believe
what
i
am
about
to
state
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
had
this
fall
without
a
doubt
now
i
will
not
buy
ayinger
any
longer
because
it
is
waaaay
overpriced
so
that
being
said
pours
a
more
reddish
colour
than
amber
nice
looking
beer
no
tracing
down
the
glass
but
a
head
that
is
not
soapy
great
spicey
scents
on
the
nose
twinge
of
hops
as
well
goes
down
crisply
and
smoothly
nothing
offensive
good
nutty
caramel
flavors
shine
through
and
no
lingering
aftertaste
beer
can
be
drank
constantly
and
the
price
is
great
too
now
genessee
you
tweak
any
of
this
recipe
and
you
will
lose
a
customer
i
am
going
to
purchase
another
case
this
fall
drinkability
very
smooth
another
please
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
a
touch
buttery
and
doughy
and
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
caramel
malt
with
some
metallic
notes
and
a
spot
of
lemon
the
buttery
taste
is
not
really
present
an
earthy
tealike
bitter
hop
rounds
out
the
brew
the
feel
is
of
a
moderate
body
with
tingly
carbonation
good
balance
between
sweet
and
the
earthy
hops
finishes
a
tad
sticky
a
standard
american
marzen
brew
caramel
malt
profile
with
earthygrassy
hops
tastes
like
is
smells
very
malt
forward
bready
hops
are
there
kind
of
earthy
but
not
very
prominent
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
some
stickiness
in
the
end
fairly
drinkable
although
as
others
have
said
the
sweetness
does
catch
up
after
awhile
a
basic
and
reasonable
example
of
an
amber
version
of
oktoberfest
beer
i
might
revisit
although
there
are
many
other
versions
that
are
better
examples
in
my
opinion
24
nrs
for
20
99a
good
value
pours
beautiful
red
with
a
generous
tan
head
with
a
creamy
look
and
feel
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
very
toasty
and
earthy
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
but
that
is
not
a
criticism
a
very
tasty
marzen
and
at
least
where
i
live
an
excellent
value
for
a
six
pack
brownishamber
colored
beer
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
malts
taste
is
breadcaramel
and
toasted
malts
overall
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
great
beer
for
those
mild
autumn
days
and
chilly
fall
nights
i
would
buy
again
and
recommend
fairly
drinkable
though
the
maltiness
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
forward
for
continuous
quaffing
after
two
bottles
it
begins
to
become
a
bit
cloying
still
a
rather
wellcrafted
example
of
the
style
that
for
the
price
can
almost
not
be
beat
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
pretty
well
the
aroma
present
the
lager
yeast
in
the
front
with
a
bit
of
caramel
roasted
malt
and
some
nutiness
the
taste
brings
a
lot
of
malt
character
to
the
party
with
the
nasty
little
bottom
feeders
doing
their
thing
well
the
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
co2
make
this
an
easy
drink
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
healthy
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
with
minimal
chunky
lacing
has
a
nice
malty
slightly
toasty
smell
to
it
the
first
hit
is
the
malt
and
then
a
crisp
rush
of
carbonation
followed
by
some
pleasing
bitterness
the
finish
is
fast
and
the
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
with
good
drinkability
held
back
somewhat
by
a
lack
of
character
d
for
a
dundee
offering
its
pretty
good
compared
to
many
other
oktoberfests
its
somewhat
pedestrian
but
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
tanishwhite
head
smells
like
pumpkins
i
hate
hot
weather
and
its
still
august
so
the
pumpkin
smell
might
get
a
better
rating
out
of
me
since
i
am
longing
for
the
fall
season
anyways
this
has
much
more
of
a
maltcaramel
taste
than
the
more
traditional
oktoberfest
hoppy
flavor
with
a
pumpkinish
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
this
is
a
solid
octoberfest
brew
but
id
probably
mix
it
up
with
another
fall
brew
a
clear
amber
color
pour
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
some
lacing
left
behind
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
toasty
with
some
faint
wood
notes
flavor
is
malty
sweet
caramel
and
bread
dough
some
lite
spice
medium
body
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
with
a
malty
sweet
finish
quite
sessionable
and
better
that
expected
dundee
oktoberfest
is
a
crystal
clear
sparkling
amber
beer
with
an
off
white
film
of
a
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
theres
not
much
aroma
to
it
it
smells
a
little
sweet
and
pretzely
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
chewy
finish
thats
a
little
chalky
it
tastes
pretzely
and
mellow
theres
a
tiny
touch
of
sweetness
thats
well
balanced
with
a
green
leafy
bitterness
yup
oktoberfest
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
tastes
more
like
a
traditional
fest
one
of
gennys
best
offerings
imo
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
malts
taste
is
big
on
malts
somewhat
sweet
notmuch
else
going
on
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
substantial
in
the
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
d
i
think
id
stay
at
one
too
light
for
the
style
nonoffensive
ok
but
not
great
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
eggshell
colored
head
and
unexpectedly
nice
lacing
smell
toasted
and
caramel
malts
and
noble
hops
smells
kind
of
like
their
pale
ale
and
their
discontinued
amber
taste
straightforward
with
caramel
and
a
touch
of
munich
malt
alongside
toasted
malt
and
faint
noble
hops
mouthfeel
light
bodied
smooth
carbonation
but
with
a
hard
water
feel
not
bad
worth
the
56pack
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
pretty
good
beer
its
nice
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
not
a
bad
beer
easy
to
drink
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
this
version
of
an
ofestmarzen
worth
a
try
and
one
i
would
revisit
in
the
future
if
the
opportunity
arose
pours
a
threefinger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
traces
of
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
caramel
nose
flavor
is
caramel
with
the
hops
in
the
background
almost
but
not
too
sweet
1
20
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
easy
to
drink
very
far
from
special
but
then
again
that
is
my
general
impression
of
the
marzen
style
drinkability
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
beer
its
kind
of
light
for
an
ofest
but
a
good
solid
beer
only
23
for
a
case
you
cant
beat
it
def
worth
a
try
dundee
now
genesee
oktoberfest
is
a
paintbythenumbers
version
of
a
style
that
is
not
among
my
favorites
that
said
it
got
most
of
the
way
onto
my
good
side
early
and
stayed
there
throughout
all
12
ounces
along
with
dundee
porter
this
is
probably
my
favorite
hfbc
beer
appears
a
clear
caramel
amber
orange
hue
in
the
body
with
a
large
off
white
head
forms
thick
with
ample
lacing
cling
evenly
across
my
dimpled
mug
aromatics
are
clean
with
toasted
malt
sweet
caramel
noted
and
mild
herbal
hops
blended
with
mineral
water
flavor
has
again
a
very
clean
and
subtle
moderate
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
toasted
nuts
and
caramel
malts
weight
in
but
no
heavy
its
more
like
oktoberfest
light
but
in
a
good
way
definitely
a
well
crafted
brew
from
high
falls
excellent
drinkability
light
to
medium
bodied
even
sturdy
carbonation
nothing
here
is
too
heavy
just
maybe
at
times
a
bit
too
muted
if
i
want
something
really
flavorful
if
im
grabbing
a
sixer
though
this
is
a
contender
for
sure
especially
in
the
fall
around
thanksgiving
football
time
of
year
drinkability
i
am
a
fan
of
oktoberfests
and
this
one
didnt
dissapoint
but
it
was
somewhat
average
i
dont
want
to
say
bland
in
comparison
to
other
oktoberfests
that
being
said
this
beer
was
rather
drinkable
and
i
would
recommend
it
not
bad
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
a
marzen
and
likely
cheaper
than
my
current
favorite
marzen
sam
adams
octoberfest
i
think
you
should
try
a
bottle
of
dundee
octoberfest
and
decide
for
yourself
drinkability
eh
its
tolerable
even
okay
at
times
like
a
proper
oktoberfest
that
got
the
volume
turned
down
on
it
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
right
in
the
mainstream
of
marzens
with
an
amber
transparency
and
a
fullfinger
whitish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
along
with
the
lace
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
leads
into
a
smooth
full
mouth
with
sparkly
carbonation
its
sweet
on
the
palate
and
finishes
off
with
very
slight
bitterness
without
a
lot
of
satisfying
oopmph
pretty
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
d
it
is
a
lil
heavy
to
be
pounding
this
back
it
filled
me
up
pretty
quick
but
a
nice
beer
for
a
dinner
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
munich
and
crystal
malts
its
quite
good
actually
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
very
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
breadlike
character
it
has
a
nice
crystal
malt
sweetness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
most
of
the
ones
ive
tried
lately
have
been
lighter
in
color
and
not
as
complex
this
is
a
very
good
marzen
feels
dry
but
also
milky
fullbodied
like
the
label
says
its
a
big
milky
autumnal
beer
terrific
because
of
the
carbonation
i
would
probably
only
be
able
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
body
is
slighly
light
for
the
style
but
it
only
slightly
cloys
making
this
a
very
drinkble
beer
a
decent
out
of
the
gate
fest
for
the
boys
from
new
york
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
nice
offering
in
the
dundee
line
of
brews
medium
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
altogether
a
decent
brew
maybe
more
of
an
amber
lager
than
an
oktoberfest
but
still
well
worth
trying
served
43
degrees
dark
amber
color
with
a
smell
of
sweet
malts
a
good
sweet
carmel
malty
taste
with
a
bit
of
hops
light
tasting
and
very
drinkable
for
6
99
a
sixer
drank
most
of
the
6
from
the
bottle
what
heresy
not
bad
overall
i
expect
to
see
more
of
these
weak
octoberfest
since
seasonals
are
so
popular
simple
take
on
the
style
here
that
could
have
maybe
have
done
with
a
little
less
sweetness
and
packed
a
touch
more
body
decent
stuff
though
that
went
down
easily
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
unexciting
side
of
the
american
amber
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
dont
overlook
dundee
theyre
doing
a
lot
of
things
right
these
days
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
clean
finish
this
beer
makes
a
decent
supermarket
choice
certainly
not
a
bad
deal
at
6
99sixer
couldve
used
a
better
balance
between
the
malts
yeast
and
definitely
better
carbonation
but
otherwise
an
acceptable
take
on
the
oktoberfest
d
good
stuff
i
just
wish
it
had
some
sort
of
scent
im
a
big
fan
of
sniffing
i
often
nose
a
beer
for
five
minutes
before
i
even
drink
the
damn
thing
and
this
one
ruins
that
part
of
the
beerxperience
for
me
all
around
this
is
a
good
beer
despite
its
one
major
flaw
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
on
a
cold
late
autumn
day
im
thinking
huddled
around
a
bonfire
with
friends
sort
of
sessioning
here
notes
overall
its
a
good
offering
for
good
price
d
this
is
a
good
offering
from
dundee
i
will
say
any
self
respecting
brewer
that
cant
make
a
good
ofest
is
pretty
unexcusable
this
is
a
good
ofest
solid
and
affordable
cheers
d
pretty
much
a
typical
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
i
have
yet
to
encounter
a
great
one
overall
impression
this
is
a
relatively
simple
oktoberfest
but
for
the
price
it
is
a
pretty
good
offering
pours
a
clear
straight
copper
underneath
a
three
finger
head
after
avery
hard
pour
the
head
recedes
to
nothing
and
no
bubbling
i
dont
get
it
good
color
and
thats
it
the
aroma
is
just
straight
forward
sweet
malt
anda
soft
grassy
hop
the
taste
is
nice
toasted
mlats
ixed
with
a
shetrock
dry
grass
and
adjunct
the
taste
leaves
pretty
quick
but
it
is
has
undeniable
octoberfest
beer
flavors
just
cheapened
a
bit
still
pretty
drinkable
though
eric
overall
a
decent
choice
for
the
price
nothing
offensive
or
offputting
just
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
drinkability
is
moderate
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
which
limits
it
a
bit
poor
quality
isnt
the
most
fun
to
drink
but
it
is
sessionable
and
inoffensive
drinkability
pretty
much
the
same
as
above
pours
a
light
toasted
amber
with
a
thin
head
some
faint
cornlike
aromas
tastes
exactly
like
coors
light
with
a
little
vienna
malt
in
it
in
my
opinion
light
and
drinkable
definitely
does
not
live
up
to
the
slogan
be
full
bodied
though
disappointing
because
i
had
enjoyed
all
of
dundees
new
line
of
beers
a
lot
as
with
all
the
high
falls
brews
in
exception
to
the
very
very
tasty
porter
if
they
used
more
higher
quality
ingredients
to
create
their
beers
they
would
be
much
more
impressive
high
falls
continues
to
release
okay
but
mostly
lackluster
beers
i
know
they
are
capable
of
so
much
more
i
also
understand
they
are
in
a
weird
position
of
a
kinda
macro
brewer
that
has
been
trying
to
look
like
a
microbrewer
steve
this
is
the
only
beer
that
becks
makes
that
doesnt
taste
aweful
smell
like
weed
not
a
good
example
of
octoberfest
aroma
toasted
malt
faint
caramel
honey
dried
leaves
bready
taste
metallic
light
grass
floral
hops
earthy
slight
bitter
finish
overall
an
average
beer
i
will
not
seek
this
out
in
the
future
but
i
dont
feel
it
was
a
waste
of
money
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
a
bit
skunky
like
their
lager
with
an
octoberfest
twist
overall
drinkable
but
minor
flaws
prevent
me
from
recommending
this
beer
since
it
was
already
jounced
and
agitated
i
simply
popped
the
cap
and
began
a
gentle
pour
this
still
resulted
in
a
pseudocascade
and
two
fingers
of
fizzy
rocky
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
it
all
speaks
to
the
idea
that
once
the
cap
had
been
compromised
i
needed
to
drink
it
color
was
deep
amberlight
copper
to
copper
srm
13
caramel
sweet
upfront
with
spicy
hop
halfway
through
followed
up
with
more
tealike
sweetness
as
the
beer
warms
i
pick
up
more
toasted
malt
and
grains
light
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
o
surprise
surprise
this
beer
does
not
have
the
aroma
or
flavor
of
skunk
which
is
surprising
considering
i
grabbed
it
as
a
single
in
a
grocery
store
with
bright
fluorescent
lights
and
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
better
than
i
was
expecting
since
i
was
expecting
the
skunkiness
to
be
present
but
still
not
an
amazing
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
pours
a
medium
darker
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
really
no
lacing
to
mention
the
aroma
is
of
just
some
malts
nothing
special
really
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
bread
yeast
in
the
mix
as
well
a
bit
watery
though
lighter
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
as
would
be
excepted
from
a
bud
product
overall
it
was
ok
serving
type
bottle
found
this
one
a
little
boring
in
taste
a
tad
watery
and
a
metallic
taste
which
was
a
tad
off
putting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
this
was
a
average
at
best
example
of
a
oktoberfest
it
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
and
aroma
there
were
a
few
off
aspects
that
held
this
beer
back
from
being
on
par
with
the
style
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
clean
crisp
not
filling
at
all
but
the
taste
didnt
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
any
more
than
that
and
i
know
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
and
the
off
aspects
would
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
there
were
both
nice
and
they
seemed
to
be
the
aspects
that
were
the
truest
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
were
the
off
flavors
and
aromas
this
beer
would
be
much
better
if
it
didnt
have
those
stale
grain
skunky
and
apple
cider
like
aspects
to
it
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
chance
but
its
pretty
easy
to
find
a
much
better
traditional
example
of
the
style
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
but
it
might
be
wroth
a
try
if
your
already
a
becks
fan
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
i
could
only
looks
past
some
many
off
aspects
till
it
started
to
wear
on
me
and
i
realized
that
im
just
not
into
this
beer
ive
only
had
the
regular
becks
and
i
liked
it
just
about
as
much
as
i
liked
this
beer
so
i
can
say
how
it
ranks
for
this
brewery
but
its
for
sure
not
one
of
the
better
marzens
ive
had
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
one
could
use
a
little
cleaning
up
better
luck
next
time
guys
middle
of
the
road
but
tasty
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink

just
a

of
a

and
then
a
fast

not

certainly
sessionable
judgement
pass
rjt
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
not
the
best
from
braurei
beck
bottom
line
worth
checking
this
beer
out
the
palate
detects
a
mild
hit
of
caramel
and
fig
while
the
mouthfeel
tends
toward
a
mild
driness
little
hops
no
afterness
and
very
low
carbonation
makes
this
much
like
all
octoberfets
a
relaible
session
makes
sense
as
people
dont
drink
this
beer
to
get
mindlessly
drunk
this
they
save
that
for
dopplebock
season
it
feels
good
a
nice
mix
of
crisp
and
smooth
in
a
medium
body
with
just
a
touch
of
dryness
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
overall
a
little
subdued
in
flavor
an
easy
drinking
autumn
style
brew
that
may
be
nice
when
tailgating
or
just
socializing
outdoors
with
friends
overall
i
have
had
this
in
many
consecutive
years
and
feel
that
i
give
it
an
unearned
esteem
because
it
hales
from
germany
as
i
reviewed
this
i
am
disappointed
in
this
years
model
2013
i
remember
previous
releases
as
being
a
go
to
for
the
oktoberfest
season
and
this
one
leaves
me
lacking
will
i
try
it
again
next
year
yes
will
there
be
unopened
bottles
a
month
from
now
probably
not
but
i
feel
this
is
overall
an
inferior
offering
at
least
for
this
year
only
drawback
is
it
can
be
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
pretty
diluted
oktoberfest
brew
lacks
any
robust
malt
aroma
taste
or
feel
for
the
style
sure
there
are
hints
of
these
good
things
but
they
get
washed
out
with
the
overall
mediocrity
of
this
brew
o
an
average
oktoberfest
but
i
think
it
should
be
slightly
higher
rated
then
what
it
is
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
mug
pours
a
dark
amber
transparent
with
a
small
beige
head
that
fleets
away
quickly
this
beer
smells
sweet
with
caramel
notes
toffee
wheat
bread
i
dont
really
care
for
the
feel
on
this
one
there
is
a
great
amount
of
bubbles
rising
through
this
one
that
really
gives
this
a
spritzy
feel
i
think
this
detracts
from
enjoying
the
flavors
quite
a
bit
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
average
to
the
style
sweet
caramel
mild
bitterness
metallic
ting
on
the
back
end
this
beer
had
some
some
things
i
liked
about
it
but
overall
nothing
really
worked
together
with
so
many
better
options
available
to
me
at
this
time
of
year
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
this
one
again
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
malt
complexity
is
overshadowed
by
the
metallicsour
character
but
its
not
enough
to
ruin
the
experience
completely
malty
up
front
rich
toasted
malts
caramel
a
little
coffee
bitterness
towards
the
finish
medium
bodied
crisp
well
carbonated
overall
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
brewed
in
st
louis
and
not
germany
so
its
not
really
an
import
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
solid
choice
for
fall
consumption
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
crisply
carbonated
you
could
do
worse
in
an
octoberfest
but
in
the
end
my
impression
of
this
beer
was
one
that
was
both
a
little
bland
and
a
little
too
sweet
the
flavor
however
really
suffers
from
a
diluted
and
weak
malt
presence
that
doesnt
provide
enough
toasted
or
bready
structure
for
the
hopping
which
is
actually
surprisingly
welldone
btw
to
build
upon
adjust
the
grain
bill
to
match
the
care
and
attention
put
into
the
hopping
and
this
one
could
be
something
special
flavor
wise
they
seem
to
have
hit
the
spot
somewhat
hoppy
and
malty
i
feel
the
need
to
subtract
12
a
points
for
printing
pry
off
on
the
bottle
cap
im
pretty
sure
ive
never
had
another
beer
have
to
print
that
out
for
me
yet
somehow
ive
always
managed
to
figure
it
out
stamp
on
the
back
says
12206
which
seems
like
its
missing
a
digit
oh
well
i
like
it
all
anyway
a
good
flavor
can
overcome
everything
else
i
guess
i
often
look
forward
to
october
for
the
obligatory
oktoberfest
beers
so
when
i
saw
an
oktoberfest
by
becks
who
happens
to
brew
a
personal
favorite
the
dark
i
was
excited
that
excitement
fell
to
malaise
as
i
experienced
one
of
the
more
bland
and
average
beer
tastes
of
the
season
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
bland
is
all
i
can
muster
sorry
oh
abinbev
you
ruined
an
almost
ruinable
style
my
god
theres
too
much
grain
and
nothing
to
balance
it
out
i
want
more
sweetness
but
theres
an
astringent
bite
that
just
doesnt
work
but
that
was
at
first
i
get
what
its
about
now
the
skunk
has
faded
enough
to
let
the
light
watery
caramel
shine
still
average
but
better
than
bad
its
breaking
bad
sorry
i
had
to
overall
im
never
buying
this
again
in
fact
im
never
drinking
a
beer
that
is
in
a
green
bottle
again
surprisingly
good
though
with
the
multitude
of
oktoberfest
beers
its
probably
not
one
id
buy
again
perfect
for
more
than
one
kind
of
seasonal
beer
poured
copper
color
with
very
little
head
smelled
a
bit
stale
most
likely
was
expired
thin
mouthfeel
that
coated
the
tongue
with
an
unpleasant
bitterness
it
could
have
been
more
carbonated
heavy
maltiness
with
an
offputing
sour
hop
flavor
tasted
far
from
balanced
overall
definitely
not
the
average
oktoberfest
its
different
but
not
in
a
bad
way
if
you
like
amber
or
brown
ales
then
youd
like
this
opinion
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
like
the
aroma
and
wish
that
it
carried
into
the
flavor
completely
as
it
is
i
wont
have
any
problem
drinking
the
sixpack
of
this
beer
but
i
actually
like
the
regular
oktoberfest
offerings
of
paulaner
and
spaten
better
than
this
one
oh
well
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
as
it
truly
is
one
of
becks
better
offerings
and
undoubtedly
one
of
the
better
beers
that
you
will
find
at
walmart
dthe
aroma
is
dead
on
for
what
i
like
in
an
oktoberfest
but
id
really
like
more
malt
to
come
through
in
the
taste
department
d
not
bad
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
of
these
and
not
one
went
to
waste
would
definitely
revisit
d
not
bad
pretty
good
for
becks
i
thought
they
did
a
good
job
of
bringing
up
the
malt
flavor
which
is
usually
lacking
in
these
types
of
macro
beers
with
some
pumpkinoctober
spice
could
have
used
more
body
13
99
for
a
12
pack
in
atlanta
ga
on
tap
at
charlie
and
bennys
chili
restaurant
indianapolis
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
just
a
bit
of
decent
head
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
crisp
and
autumnleaf
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
caramel
and
a
nice
hit
of
thick
malts
good
flavors
clean
and
crisp
a
nice
thick
maltiness
with
some
caramel
in
it
and
a
bit
of
nice
spicy
noble
hops
at
the
end
went
down
very
smooth
overall
it
is
hard
to
tell
if
the
terrible
finish
is
a
result
of
a
dirty
line
or
some
other
kind
of
infection
in
the
beer
even
if
the
malt
characteristics
had
been
more
prominent
this
offering
could
have
fared
much
better
on
the
palate
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
decent
looking
pour
with
good
clarity
smells
of
raisins
grains
and
malts
some
toffee
also
present
taste
has
a
nice
bitter
presence
to
it
pretty
drinkable
with
it
being
pretty
light
overall
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
nothing
really
stands
out
with
it
one
of
if
not
the
my
last
ofests
still
hangin
round
the
fridge
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuits
slathered
in
buttery
toffee
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
doesnt
change
much
but
it
does
toast
the
biscuits
pretty
thoroughly
and
adds
a
touch
of
mandarin
orange
flesh
for
good
measure
well
it
was
a
nice
thought
anyway
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
ofest
the
toasted
nearly
charred
taste
really
does
nothing
to
help
this
stuff
along
at
all
o
surprisingly
good
different
from
some
of
the
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
pretty
similar
to
a
regular
becks
with
a
hint
of
caramel
feel
is
pretty
thin
with
a
little
carbonation
the
taste
is
also
light
it
reminds
me
of
regular
becks
although
with
a
little
caramel
there
are
the
grassy
notes
and
a
very
slight
hop
bite
overall
this
is
okay
out
of
the
510
oktoberfests
ive
tried
this
year
this
might
be
the
worst
of
fifteen
to
twenty
different
oktoberfeststs
ive
sampled
this
is
my
goto
d
overall
this
was
surprisingly
good
for
a
mass
produced
beer
i
had
been
on
a
bit
of
an
oktoberfest
tasting
kick
and
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
nicely
balanced
and
relatively
flavorful
appearance
is
a
light
ruby
orange
that
pours
a
thick
head
leaving
faint
lace
smell
is
lightly
sweet
and
roasted
caramel
grainy
taste
has
that
becks
background
of
grain
with
some
roasted
malts
thrown
in
having
a
light
sweet
note
and
mild
bitter
that
cloys
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
wouldnt
be
my
first
go
to
for
an
oktoberfest
but
not
bad
overall
not
a
bad
beer
no
where
near
the
best
octoberfest
that
ive
had
but
certainly
far
from
the
worst
as
evident
by
the
fact
ive
had
3
so
far
unfortunately
this
doesnt
do
it
for
me
being
from
a
german
brewery
i
was
expecting
something
more
this
however
is
a
played
up
version
of
any
other
euro
lager
in
both
taste
and
smell
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
there
is
a
great
flavor
and
nothing
offputting
about
it
id
consider
getting
a
6er
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pretty
much
nothing
there
is
some
extremely
faint
malt
but
it
is
really
hard
to
detect
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
that
i
will
not
drink
again
overall
a
good
beer
across
the
board
pours
an
appetizing
dark
clear
amber
with
a
finebubbled
pale
ambertan
head
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
honey
note
and
a
fruity
hint
mainly
malty
flavor
has
tones
of
honey
and
caramel
with
hints
of
cloves
and
horehound
texture
has
an
average
body
and
is
quite
fizzy
leaving
a
nice
tingle
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
are
too
many
really
good
marzens
for
me
to
want
to
come
back
to
this
one
mouth
feel
is
well
balanced
and
very
sessionable
well
done
becks
o
way
too
many
things
gone
wrong
with
this
one
and
it
just
came
out
d
this
beer
is
great
i
am
shocked
at
how
good
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
at
its
abv
i
could
easily
enjoy
this
over
an
oktoberfest
grill
love
it
taste
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
up
front
giving
way
to
sweet
doughy
bread
then
ending
with
bitter
herb
that
seems
to
dominate
finishes
dry
and
there
are
some
toasted
bread
notes
there
is
some
really
good
flavor
going
on
here
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
off
pours
out
a
dark
copper
with
a
creamy
whitehead
the
retention
is
very
good
and
lacing
sticks
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the
beer
mug
get
caramel
and
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
the
taste
starts
out
with
caramel
followed
by
some
hops
and
spices
and
finishes
off
with
some
roasted
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
and
easy
drinking
this
tastes
different
than
the
oktoberfest
beers
i
reviewed
but
it
is
a
yummy
beer
and
sometimes
different
is
good
oa
decently
dark
tasting
example
of
the
style
fairly
complex
and
pretty
impressive
i
like
this
it
goes
down
quite
easy
didnt
expect
this
from
becks
i
could
totally
see
me
setting
a
lot
of
these
back
at
some
late
september
celebration
in
munich
overall
a
light
oktoberfest
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
making
it
quite
drinkable
it
is
typical
of
the
märzen
style
and
a
tasty
brew
overall
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
still
enjoyable
has
decent
flavor
and
is
easy
enough
to
drink
beer
is
mildly
sweet
and
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
and
skunky
green
bottle
alert
apparently
becks
doesnt
know
how
to
take
care
of
their
beer
idiots
never
again
taste
is
pretty
good
despite
that
green
bottle
skunky
flavor
that
is
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
is
an
okay
oktoberfest
for
that
transition
from
summer
styles
to
autumn
beers
its
light
refreshing
and
not
heavy
at
all
certainly
sessionable
at
only
5
abv
but
after
two
youre
ready
for
something
with
a
more
complex
flavor
not
bad
from
a
macro
though
and
the
best
from
becks
mouthfeel
feels
too
light
has
a
sharp
crispiness
that
almost
stings
the
tongue
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
2
inch
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
random
spots
and
streaks
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
some
grassy
aromas
i
did
get
a
quick
whiff
of
skunk
when
i
first
opened
the
bottle
taste
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
bitterness
on
each
sip
that
lingers
on
the
palate
a
nice
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
one
too
much
d
way
better
than
og
becks
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
would
pair
well
with
a
meatheavy
dinner
had
this
a
few
years
ago
at
a
festival
at
blue
mountain
ski
resort
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
was
decent
but
still
had
that
skunky
aroma
like
the
lager
has
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
better
due
to
the
malt
base
being
darker
it
hid
the
skunkiness
a
little
better
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
pretty
standard
feeling
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
have
to
have
this
again
but
i
could
if
it
was
around
pours
a
copperorange
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
moderate
level
of
carbonation
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
thin
aroma
is
average
mostly
sweet
malts
bit
of
caramel
in
the
taste
as
an
oktoberfest
it
is
heavier
on
the
malt
side
not
very
bitter
at
all
its
quite
tasty
but
nothing
special
i
would
definitely
choose
this
over
becks
lager
as
it
is
more
flavorful
and
although
you
can
taste
that
it
is
a
macro
brew
it
is
still
decently
drinkable
and
inoffensive
to
my
palate
lacking
harsh
or
astringent
adjunct
or
skunk
taste
a
good
german
macro
beer
probably
not
as
tasty
as
a
fresher
americanbrewed
version
but
still
a
good
intro
to
the
style
verdict
if
you
want
a
versatile
easydrinking
introduction
to
this
style
becks
oktoberfest
isnt
a
bad
selection
if
you
want
an
okto
with
character
you
should
probably
look
elsewhere
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
i
would
have
expected
and
retains
some
nice
hop
bitterness
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
the
sweetness
does
cloy
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
but
overall
this
is
satisfying
and
easy
to
drink
texture
could
possibly
use
a
bit
of
thinning
solid
overall
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
glass
one
of
my
top
5
oktoberfest
biers
pours
deep
redish
amber
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
aroma
is
full
of
nice
grainy
malts
a
little
caramel
some
toast
and
what
smells
like
adjunct
corn
flavor
is
not
terrible
but
falls
a
little
flat
and
weak
grainy
a
little
caramel
faint
toast
metalic
off
malt
notes
more
of
the
corny
hints
and
some
planty
hops
finish
has
a
toast
quality
a
good
helping
of
metal
and
some
bitter
hops
the
body
is
pretty
thin
and
well
carbonated
deep
amber
quite
clear
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
diminished
rather
quickly
and
left
some
streaks
of
lace
caramel
is
most
prominent
in
the
aroma
followed
by
a
touch
of
very
light
biscuit
and
almost
a
toffee
like
tone
flavors
are
mild
yet
balanced
and
articulated
definite
caramelized
malt
going
on
light
on
the
bitterness
in
fact
its
only
there
in
the
background
to
balance
out
the
caramel
soft
finish
that
accentuates
the
sweetness
well
carbonated
maybe
even
a
touch
over
what
i
want
as
it
gives
my
palate
a
hearty
prickle
but
not
overdone
at
all
this
is
a
well
made
classic
example
of
the
style
a
great
anytime
beer
becks
oktoberfest
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
weak
scent
of
spices
and
heavier
scent
of
malts
the
same
is
in
the
taste
with
weaker
spices
and
thicker
on
the
malts
but
they
are
very
well
blended
together
in
a
good
smooth
taste
its
nice
to
have
an
oktoberfest
beer
that
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
spice
taste
like
some
of
the
american
beers
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
exceptionally
clean
and
balanced
its
only
drawbacks
for
me
are
the
toolow
carbonation
and
lack
of
head
d
very
drinkable
in
session
this
to
my
surprise
happened
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
most
drinkable
marzen
ive
tried
simple
smooth
ideal
malt
flavor
and
body
a
look
just
like
youd
like
deep
dark
auburn
body
and
a
big
healthy
offwhite
head
that
expands
effortlessly
from
the
pour
however
doesnt
cling
too
well
to
the
glass
once
again
a
simple
straightforward
uberclean
thick
malt
aroma
where
hops
nor
yeast
influence
what
is
a
textbook
oktoberfestbier
smell
drinks
clean
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
malt
backbone
that
features
a
fairly
musky
not
spicy
tone
to
it
the
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
is
stellar
as
well
in
other
words
the
taste
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
finish
is
only
slightly
dry
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
i
have
never
had
the
original
becks
and
was
kind
of
scared
to
find
this
in
my
mystery
six
pack
but
it
drinks
rather
well
unfortunately
it
pulls
off
kind
of
like
a
domestic
oktoberfest
with
way
too
little
going
for
it
drinkable
smelled
like
carmel
for
the
most
part
tasted
like
a
mix
of
chemical
flavours
if
you
ask
me
overly
sweet
caramel
and
spices
slightly
malted
but
after
the
initil
impact
of
the
flavour
the
malt
just
made
my
mouth
feel
sour
imho
this
is
one
of
the
poorer
oktoberfests
ive
had
to
date
d
i
wasnt
expecting
to
think
this
was
very
good
but
i
actually
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
liked
this
as
did
my
guests
so
thats
the
only
score
that
really
matters
i
gave
it
a
rating
of
3
0
for
appearance
and
smell
because
i
like
to
drink
it
not
look
at
it
or
smell
it
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
find
good
value
and
easily
accessible
a
good
change
from
the
regular
becks
given
the
season
i
picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
while
it
reminds
me
a
touch
of
spaten
oktoberfest
its
not
close
to
any
of
the
other
classic
of
the
style
theres
a
big
roasted
caramel
and
toffee
taste
up
front
but
then
the
character
fades
to
a
watery
basic
bready
pilsner
taste
while
its
a
bit
odd
for
an
opening
flavor
its
decent
ill
admit
but
then
fades
to
a
bland
lager
with
a
bitter
herbal
finish
theres
good
and
theres
bad
but
most
oktoberfests
are
all
good
aftertaste
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
the
hops
offering
a
very
well
crafted
balance
to
the
beer
d
not
bad
oktober
beer
overall
would
have
more
in
the
future
becks
octoberfest
tastes
a
lot
like
well
regular
becks
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
very
drinkable
as
is
regular
becks
but
quite
a
disappointment
for
an
octoberfest
d
this
beer
has
a
great
full
flavor
but
its
still
very
drinkable
d
the
abv
is
low
which
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
but
there
is
not
a
lot
here
flavor
wise
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
a
great
deal
of
this
beer
looks
great
but
that
is
about
it
drinkability
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
its
so
accessible
i
had
to
pick
up
a
single
at
1
75
becks
oktoberfest
redeemed
my
faith
in
the
style
whether
at
a
festival
or
hanging
with
friends
i
could
drink
this
all
day
or
all
night
try
it
for
yourself
md
its
just
okay
to
me
lots
of
better
maerzens
out
there
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
many
more
id
got
to
first
not
a
solid
performance
oktoberfest
should
be
made
in
bavaria
not
in
bremen
or
anywhere
in
the
north
period
not
bad
just
not
good
if
i
was
going
to
drink
something
i
tolerate
it
might
as
well
have
bud
drinkability
unfortunately
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
here
despite
it
tasting
okay
easy
enough
to
drink
but
maybe
not
worth
coming
back
for
d
average
drinkability
but
its
a
bland
beer
across
the
board
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
anything
going
on
in
this
one
and
the
metallic
flavor
is
far
too
much
d
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
oktoberfestmärzen
it
fits
the
bill
but
lacks
some
of
the
rich
depth
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
still
its
fairly
drinkable
and
not
unpleasant
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
among
my
favorites
in
style
if
i
were
reaching
for
an
oktoberfests
i
know
of
others
that
id
prefer
overall
i
am
actually
a
fan
of
becks
i
dont
have
any
bad
things
to
say
about
it
i
prefer
the
dark
and
this
the
light
is
too
much
like
corn
but
this
is
rather
drinkable
and
i
bet
would
be
a
treat
on
tap
much
more
malty
and
less
balanced
than
its
bavarian
cousins
of
this
style
not
quite
sure
how
to
catagorize
it
really
a
tasty
treat
nevertheless
probably
the
best
beer
becks
puts
out
this
malty
redamber
brew
pours
with
solid
lacing
and
a
rich
yeasty
biscuit
toastiness
upon
initial
sips
not
really
a
complex
beer
but
easily
drinkable
and
more
than
pleasing
to
my
palate
good
showing
especially
from
the
usually
subpar
becks
label
8
for
a
six
pack
of
mild
beer
isnt
really
my
thing
it
is
easy
drinking
and
it
isnt
bitter
or
high
in
alcohol
so
maybe
your
girlfriend
will
like
it
ill
keep
some
at
my
place
for
her
decided
to
try
a
becks
at
a
football
party
at
first
appearance
it
looked
all
right
lighter
than
i
like
the
aroma
was
fine
a
whiff
of
grain
decent
mouth
feel
but
very
average
after
the
initial
taste
not
a
strong
hop
finish
that
is
distinctive
of
a
fine
octoberfest
probably
not
my
next
choice
mouth
feel
is
refreshing
and
you
really
will
feel
carbonation
at
the
right
temperature
this
beer
will
be
a
lot
of
fun
great
job
for
a
seasonable
beer
even
from
a
brewery
which
is
in
my
opinion
more
a
mass
production
brewery
this
was
ok
there
are
certainly
better
oktoberfest
beers
i
could
think
of
and
i
only
had
this
because
its
what
was
available
may
i
suggest
remove
your
marketing
bias
and
approach
this
fine
beer
on
taste
alone
well
worth
the
trouble
overall
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
but
nothing
offensive
is
to
be
found
here
either
this
is
also
a
better
offering
than
their
yearround
beers
the
standard
and
dark
lagers
from
the
12
fl
oz
green
bottle
marked
062011l16104a
the
pour
is
a
good
looking
reddishamber
with
a
long
lasting
halfinch
of
head
and
deent
clinging
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
amd
thankfully
not
skunked
as
is
typical
in
the
green
bottle
the
taste
tendsw
to
be
bitter
with
malts
and
a
sharp
finale
i
liked
it
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
refreshing
in
your
mouth
nice
body
like
regular
becks
is
great
on
a

d
its
not
bad
overall
but
not
a
liter
at
a
time
marzen
a
bit
better
than
expected
still
i
expect
a
richer
flavor
in
a
marzen
heavier
on

saving
that
at

a
wellbrewed

a

i

i
will
be
drinking
again
drinks
better
than
regular
becks
or
the
dark
both
of
which
i
happen
to
like
despite
their
not
being
world
class
beers
by
any
measure
a
fine
offering
that
i
can
easily
see
myself
buying
another
sixer
of
soon
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
bit
of
a
coppery
orange
hue
looks
pretty
when
held
up
to
the
afternoon
sunlight
a
short
lived
eggshell
cap
of
foam
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
thin
collar
transient
lacing
mostly
clumpy
malty
aroma
toasted
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
bitterness
was
more
pronounced
than
i
expected
and
lingered
in
the
finish
herbal
and
grassy
hops
throughout
the
flavour
started
off
with
a
lot
of
toasted
and
caramel
malts
a
bit
bready
but
the
sweetness
fell
away
towards
the
end
leaving
a
slightly
astringent
and
metallic
finish
hanging
on
my
palate
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
decent
texture
overall
a
decent
beer
it
seems
a
little
light
in
malt
character
which
would
improve
the
flavour
profile
d
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
pretty
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
as
its
not
a
bad
marzen
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
given
the
choice
id
probably
pick
the
sam
adams
iteration
of
oktoberfest
but
becks
is
good
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
as
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
this
is
my
second
time
is
my
with
the
beers
from
becks
so
far
ive
found
to
be
average
at
best
if
i
was
at
a
oktoberfest
this
would
be
my
third
choice
to
go
for
pours
a
beautifully
clear
copper
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
the
aromas
are
faint
and
strange
in
that
im
detecting
mostly
notes
that
are
consistent
with
pils
malt
a
light
honey
and
grain
aroma
rather
than
vienna
malt
that
comprises
most
oktoberfests
there
are
none
of
the
strong
toasty
aromas
that
one
expects
from
an
oktoberfest
tastewise
the
toastiness
is
present
but
faint
there
is
a
light
tealike
bitterness
on
the
finish
its
medium
body
is
moderately
carbonated
and
feels
nice
on
the
tongue
but
overall
this
beer
is
far
too
subdued
and
lacks
the
bold
malty
character
that
makes
oktoberfests
attractive
drinkability
with
no
real
exceptional
flavors
present
its
a
fairly
easy
beer
to
drink
although
somewhat
boring
its
a
real
letdown
when
the
best
thing
about
a
beer
is
the
appearance
pretty
standard
oktoberfest
here
one
i
would
gladly
drink
again
but
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
has
a
very
strong
malt
smell
and
flavor
it
was
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
there
was
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
at
the
end
it
had
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
one
i
would
drink
again
if
they
were
to
make
it
again
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
i
just
cant
drink
a
beer
like
this
the
taste
isnt
horrible
but
the
aftertaste
and
feel
just
kills
it
d
nice
and
solid
i
like
how
some
brews
hit
both
the
style
and
the
brewery
signature
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
or
three
or
so
in
a
beer
garden
i
just
need
a
pretzel
some
hot
potato
salad
and
maybe
some
sausage
becks
oktoberfest
isnt
offensive
but
it
really
isnt
anything
else
either
overall
as
with
all
becks
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
pound
for
a
price
that
is
just
slightly
beyond
the
other
lesser
macros
works
as
a
fall
fallback
if
nothing
more
solicitous
can
be
secured
d
a
solid
brew
i
could
probably
throw
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
fall
evening
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
one
drinkability
a
good
oktoberfestbier
this
onell
probably
be
my
last
oktoberfest
of
the
season
and
it
was
a
good
one
to
go
out
on
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
amber
body
with
a
puffy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
toasted
pilsner
malt
and
faint
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
that
scrubs
your
tongue
great
clean
malt
flavors
with
a
hint
of
toffee
sweetness
that
lasts
into
the
finish
and
is
joined
by
the
faint
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
very
well
done
and
refreshingly
light
octoberfest
beer
drink
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
could
see
drinking
all
day
and
not
complain
one
bitta
this
brew
is
very
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
take
on
the
style
i
have
had
several
of
these
this
season
and
its
hard
to
find
any
that
miss
the
mark
but
at
the
same
time
this
style
hasnt
for
me
yet
had
anything
that
has
been
jaw
dropping
it
is
a
very
good
style
if
beer
and
this
is
a
good
take
on
that
style
nothing
wrong
here
easy
clean
and
crisp
with
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
taste
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
easy
pours
a
meidum
amber
color
with
a
soft
quick
head
the
aroma
is
of
light
toasted
bread
and
tricuits
with
some
delicate
grassy
hops
the
taste
has
a
faint
metallic
twang
with
more
toasted
malts
giving
dry
sweetness
of
crackers
and
a
one
day
old
loaf
of
bread
the
hops
bring
just
a
little
balance
to
this
bready
brew
very
easy
palate
but
could
do
without
the
metallic
twang
other
than
that
a
great
session
lager
cheers
this
is
a
sleeper
beer
do
not
be
a
pretentious
beer
snob
if
you
want
to
throw
down
with
some
quality
this
is
the
beer
damn
fine
drinkable
beer
imagine
if
yuengling
was
pure
and
you
have
this
beer
great
stuff
will
drink
this
again
next
year
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
special
drinkability
is
better
than
many
ofest
brews
imho
could
have
some
more
bold
aroma
but
other
than
that
a
solid
ofest
rep
acorss
the
board
d
i
would
describe
this
as
a
good
session
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
cooler
weather
nice
for
an
oktoberfest
style
overall
not
the
best
ofest
i
have
had
but
still
damn
goo
very
drinkable
this
is
on
my
list
of
beers
i
plan
to
pring
to
parties
sigh
the
best
okfest
beers
this
year
have
at
best
a
little
malt
chewiness
and
none
of
that
essential
vienna
malt
roastiness
that
with
the
other
ingredients
make
this
such
a
session
beer
style
served
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
reddish
amber
aroma
is
malty
and
a
little
caramel
flavor
is
malty
a
hint
of
bitterness
a
bit
of
toffee
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
the
rest
of
it
ok
not
bad
better
than
the
other
23rds
of
them
could
be
a
session
i
suppose
d
very
drinkable
an
overall
solid
oktoberfest
its
drink
this
again
for
sure
overall
a
nice
and
drinkable
marzen
that
i
would
drink
anytime
there
are
certainly
better
ones
out
there
but
this
is
in
no
way
offputting
a
good
okto
slammer
drinkability
a
very
nice
session
beer
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
think
that
becks
focused
more
on
the
colour
and
label
than
on
the
taste
of
the
beer
i
suppose
its
worth
a
try
if
there
isnt
a
better
choice
of
octoberfest
and
if
the
beer
is
very
cold
salud
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
too
bad
but
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
other
ofests
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
it
is
the
best
becks
has
to
offer
and
holds
its
own
in
the
oktoberfest
category
despite
its
macro
and
masses
pleasing
leanings
it
is
a
good
brew
and
is
extremely
addictive
not
as
refreshing
or
easy
drinking
as
others
of
this
style
hence
the
above
rating
becks
is
the
1
german
import
for
a
reason
friends
theyve
done
it
again
here
prost
pours
between
light
amber
and
golden
color
with
smallish
head
that
doesnt
retain
nose
is
weakfaint
with
light
toasted
malt
and
an
overall
clean
character
palate
is
light
in
flavors
body
and
is
remarkably
watery
overall
gentle
hops
are
there
but
the
light
toasty
malt
is
in
the
forefront
you
could
have
fooled
me
into
thinking
this
was
one
of
those
pseudocraft
beers
from
michelob
at
least
this
becks
is
not
skunked
d
not
a
stellar
marzen
heck
im
not
even
sure
its
an
average
marzen
not
terrible
but
i
have
no
need
to
revisit
in
the
future
the
appearance
and
aroma
keep
this
from
being
a
complete
dud
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
and
feel
it
is
easy
to
drink
although
i
feel
there
is
lots
of
room
for
improvements
it
is
a
staple
for
this
time
of
year
when
i
try
to
have
as
many
different
oktoberfest
beers
as
possible
pours
a
transparent
amber
color
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
nothing
much
available
in
the
smell
there
is
some
roasted
malt
character
but
the
entire
scent
is
somewhat
lacking
given
the
style
the
taste
is
somewhat
more
robust
with
some
caramel
and
darker
malts
little
to
no
hop
presence
to
balance
out
the
low
malt
content
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
with
low
amounts
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
given
the
feel
but
the
taste
doesnt
invite
another
sip
dvery
dinkable
smooth
medium
body
lends
to
easy
drinking
with
a
flavor
that
is
not
overpowering
while
still
providing
my
taste
buds
with
enough
action
to
keep
enjoying
themselves
and
wanting
more

head
smeel
is
mild
a
bit
malty
taste
is
also
mild
some
malts
and
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
beer
makes
for
a
decent
choice
light
coppery
amber
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
caramel
and
fresh
bread
make
up
the
nose
the
flavors
are
nice
and
rich
with
sweet
malt
and
toasted
grain
medium
smooth
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
decent
ofest
when
the
bartender
recommended
this
one
i
replied
as
long
as
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
becks
with
some
octoberfest
on
it
but
thats
just
what
it
tastes
like
maybe
its
me
but
becks
beer
always
tastes
skunked
maybe
thats
becks
the
octoberfest
is
a
little
buttery
creamy
malty
but
theres
still
that
underlying
becks
skunkation
looks
good
on
the
pour
and
i
hoped
ontap
would
relieve
me
of
the
becks
skunkation
with
the
green
glass
bottle
out
of
the
equation
but
no
i
smelt
it
tasted
it
and
drank
it
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
the
bartender
claimed
this
to
be
the
top
seller
since
it
came
in
this
week
not
for
me
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
something
i
probably
wont
buy
again
there
are
other
oktoberfests
out
there
that
appeal
to
me
more
pours
a
copper
color
not
much
of
a
head
to
this
one
nice
overall
look
to
it
though
not
much
there
for
me
in
the
aroma
department
now
to
taste
nice
mouthfeel
up
front
medium
bodied
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
very
slight
hop
tinge
to
it
as
well
kinda
watery
is
the
main
thing
i
get
with
this
one
nice
and
smooth
and
great
consistency
to
it
but
flavor
wise
there
isnt
that
much
there
then
again
this
style
is
always
lacking
enough
flavor
for
me
with
a
few
exceptions
solid
beer
but
im
sure
theres
better
ofests
out
there
d
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
sessionable
i
had
forgotten
how
much
i
liked
this
one
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
flavors
are
all
spot
on
nothing
out
of
place
definately
a
good
session
brew
drinkability
great
not
so
much
but
but
its
surprisingly
tolerable
really
and
for
me
the
best
of
the
becks
offerings
d
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
i
could
suck
down
a
six
pack
of
these
on
a
monday
night
medium
body
but
thin
in
the
middle
with
the
malt
finishes
dry
with
a
carbonic
sting
on
the
tongue
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
overall
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
taste
good
and
it
did
ive
had
becks
many
times
and
its
usually
alright
but
nothing
great
this
beer
definitely
caught
me
off
guard
its
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
style
beer
buts
definitely
does
the
style
justice
props
to
becks
for
not
screwing
this
up
d
its
ok
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
even
close
to
some
of
the
other
big
name
braueries
after
the
buzz
is
on
they
go
down
pretty
nice
poured
from
a
refrigerated
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
brownish
orange
rusty
color
and
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
settles
licely
to
an
even
quarter
inch
the
remainder
of
the
way
very
attractive
aroma
was
strong
on
malt
and
cooked
grains
the
taste
buds
tell
me
that
this
beer
tastes
as
it
smells
strong
cooked
grains
with
malt
light
on
hops
medium
bodied
beer
well
carbonated
for
the
style
slightly
dry
aftertaste
but
not
to
the
point
that
i
had
cotton
mouth
i
would
give
the
beer
higher
marks
for
drinkablility
except
that
i
woke
up
the
next
day
with
a
splitting
headache
from
a
few
of
these
although
my
dinner
was
very
light
i
recommend
this
beer
and
am
very
willing
to
try
it
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
kinda
reddish
orange
clor
the
beer
had
a
light
tan
head
that
was
gone
pretty
fast
the
beer
stunk
as
far
as
smell
goes
it
smelled
kinda
sour
and
just
off
however
the
taste
was
not
the
taste
was
really
good
caramally
with
a
little
nuttyness
i
will
buy
again
out
of
a
green
bottle
this
beer
was
a
classic
bright
orange
color
with
great
clarity
the
head
was
beige
the
retention
modest
and
the
lacing
scattered
the
nose
was
dry
with
a
slightly
stale
hint
to
the
grains
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
the
flavors
were
spoton
for
the
style
pale
malt
sweetness
very
grainy
very
dry
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
simple
but
drinkable
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
which
caused
the
mouthfeel
too
be
a
little
rough
still
for
a
becks
product
i
was
rather
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
experience
overall
a
very
clean
beer
there
is
a
dryness
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
chalky
the
beer
overall
is
okay
i
was
hoping
for
a
subtle
hint
of
sweetness
when
i
tried
the
beer
but
i
didnt
get
it
i
feel
the
hops
is
a
little
to
much
for
the
beer
brilliantly
clear
orange
with
just
a
hint
of
autumn
brown
topped
by
a
creamy
smooth
head
that
vacates
surprisingly
quickly
velvety
smooth
and
delightfully
malted
it
envelops
the
tongue
like
a
bearskin
rug
it
is
seemingly
warming
from
the
inside
like
it
assisting
in
the
perparation
for
the
winter
ahead
insulating
from
the
cold
yet
opening
your
senses
for
more
really
enjoyable
especially
inseason
but
not
wholly
if
only
for
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
leave
me
immediately
craving
the
next
one
i
will
never
understand
why
brewers
bottle
in
green
that
being
said
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
closed
case
of
this
so
the
skunkitude
wasnt
too
too
bad
the
aroma
is
hampered
by
skunk
instantly
noticible
and
it
destroys
what
would
have
been
a
fabulous
brown
sugary
maltiness
the
beer
looks
fabulous
dark
copper
with
a
mushy
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lacing
the
taste
jesus
skunk
ruined
this
beer
there
is
some
decent
caramel
sweetness
and
some
bready
malt
but
its
completely
overshadowed
by
nasty
skunkiness
and
what
i
think
is
some
weak
corn
flavor
palate
is
actually
very
good
fuzzy
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
grainy
sticky
texture
overall
though
this
was
a
waste
of
time
im
frustrated
that
i
didnt
pick
up
the
hofbrau
instead
the
worst
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
the
potential
shines
through
the
cloud
of
skunk
but
unfortunately
the
potential
is
just
that
and
this
beer
fails
to
impress
me
d
not
expecting
much
from
becks
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
a
decent
sessionable
beer
drinkability
this
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorite
domestic
styles
especially
since
almost
every
single
brewery
has
one
most
to
capitalize
on
the
suckers
who
buy
it
because
of
the
name
that
said
being
becks
its
what
you
expect
balanced
and
drinkable
enough
without
being
anything
to
really
savor
it
has
a
very
dark
bronze
body
with
lots
of
beige
head
but
there
is
not
much
for
lace
it
smells
mainly
grassy
and
mixed
grains
it
has
a
caramel
taste
at
first
then
it
becomes
a
balanced
taste
grains
and
hops
it
is
crisp
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
good
use
of
hops
it
has
almost
a
medium
body
pours
a
deep
cooper
color
with
offwhite
head
a
nice
23
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
nice
creamy
layer
its
almost
looks
and
feels
like
it
was
on
nitro
very
nice
presentation
for
a
bottled
beer
smell
is
off
a
dark
caramel
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
burnt
aroma
to
it
taste
is
good
of
roasted
grain
sweet
malt
and
a
caramel
backbone
moutfeel
was
smooth
and
a
bit
velvetlike
overall
i
have
to
say
im
very
surprised
i
bought
this
beer
because
it
was
on
clearance
for
3
99
a
six
pack
and
it
was
more
than
well
worth
it
i
would
drink
it
again
but
for
the
regular
price
that
i
have
seen
it
i
wouldnt
normally
buy
it
i
stumbled
across
it
on
sale
for
11
49
for
a
12pack
so
i
grabbed
a
couple
for
a
party
i
was
having
if
it
can
be
found
cheaper
get
it
if
its
above
15
better
options
are
available
for
this
style
overall
a
solid
octoberfest
brew
nothing
too
extreme
or
out
there
just
a
good
beer
for
drinking
and
enjoying
ive
never
been
a
big
becks
fan
but
this
one
is
every
bit
as
good
as
any
other
good
german
octoberfest
brew
drinkability
is
good
i
paired
this
with
a
dinner
of
bratwurst
red
cabbage
and
german
potato
salad
pretty
well
rounded
and
easy
to
drink
cheers
when
i
imagine
a
great
german
oktobefest
beer
i
dont
image
something
very
far
from
becks
version
of
the
infamous
beer
it
pours
a
brilliant
amber
color
with
the
smell
of
malt
grains
and
subtle
spices
it
has
the
initial
taste
of
becks
lager
but
finishes
much
smoother
with
the
malt
coming
out
and
the
smoothness
of
the
oktoberfest
shines
very
nicely
ive
had
many
oktoberfest
beers
and
i
can
say
this
one
ranks
somewhere
in
the
top
10
on
my
list
i
bet
it
would
move
up
higher
had
i
had
it
on
tap
very
pleasant
on
tap
and
easy
drinking
nice
oktoberfest
i
was
very
surprised
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
me
about
judging
a
beer
by
its
cover
pours
a
nice
honey
amber
color
with
a
small
yet
dense
off
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
faint
some
doughy
caramel
malt
and
grassygrainy
euro
skunk
the
taste
has
a
base
of
the
becks
pilsner
with
a
bit
more
a
malty
profile
there
is
a
light
yet
kind
of
harsh
grassy
hop
profile
flavors
dont
seem
to
mix
well
with
me
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
and
well
carbonated
finishes
with
a
light
yet
harsh
bitterness
it
seems
that
they
took
their
original
becks
recipe
but
used
more
caramel
malt
very
average
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
as
most
becks
offerings
are
pretty
bland
very
nice
take
on
the
style
this
beer
had
a
nice
deep
clear
copper
color
with
a
quickly
fading
tan
head
there
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
nose
a
little
caramel
and
some
roasted
malt
really
sweet
taste
the
caramel
really
stands
out
and
there
isnt
much
else
the
body
is
mediumheavy
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
hold
it
up
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
the
sweetness
is
about
right
but
there
isnt
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
dont
remember
becks
making
a
beer
as
good
as
this
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
good
sized
head
and
lacings
aroma
is
malty
with
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malts
with
a
strong
bitter
hop
presence
amazingly
good
for
a
becks
product
tastes
like
a
good
craft
beer
amber
surprisingly
tasty
freshness
counts
this
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
05
09
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
offensive
about
this
bland
watery
lager
but
its
not
to
exciting
either
if
it
wasnt
for
the
smell
and
color
it
would
be
a
very
generic
german
lager
indeed
this
was
surely
my
first
ofest
back
in
the
day
and
will
always
hold
a
fond
place
in
my
heart
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
know
longer
buy
beer
based
on
its
conducivness
to
drinking
in
extremely
large
quantities
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
something
i
probably
wont
buy
again
there
are
other
oktoberfests
out
there
that
appeal
to
me
more
nice
ambergold
reddish
color
head
wasnt
too
full
but
that
may
have
been
my
fault
in
the
pouring
smells
of
nice
sweet
carmel
malts
and
a
bit
of
hoppyness
its
got
a
pleasant
rich
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
bite
pretty
good
representation
of
what
a
marzenoktoberfest
beer
should
be
nice
full
body
and
easy
drinking
pretty
good
beer
and
a
little
less
expensive
than
the
paulaner
hackerschorr
etc
variety
id
definitely
get
this
again
o
very
drinkable
one
of
the
most
refreshing
marzens
and
one
of
my
favorites
a
simple
beer
but
a
quality
beer
a
great
beer
with
a
variety
of
food
selections
too
drinkability
so
sessionable
its
uncanny
i
can
easily
throw
back
a
sixer
and
not
even
know
i
had
one
this
one
is
better
then
the
original
becks
recipe
filled
with
flavor
yet
exemplifies
the
style
perfectly
well
crafted
brew
and
becks
deserves
its
props
d
its
pleasant
but
not
something
id
keep
coming
back
to
still
as
far
as
sweeter
beers
go
its
definitely
one
of
the
ones
more
tolerable
to
my
palate
notes
overall
its
a
solid
oktoberfest
nicely
drinkable
and
quite
better
than
expected
decent
marzen
choice
for
the
price
so
drink
up
its
pure
and
pretty
decent
but
still
seems
like
a
macro
id
chose
more
local
tobes
very
good
oktoberfest
not
the
most
complex
but
what
this
did
it
did
well
this
is
one
id
certainly
order
again
well
done
cheers
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
instead
of
a
single
all
in
all
not
the
most
spectacular
beer
in
the
world
but
a
drinkable
flavorful
beer
great
session
beer
and
that
hits
the
style
right
on
the
money
overall
it
isnt
very
impressive
but
does
exude
many
characteristics
of
the
style
decently
becks
oktoberfest
was
dark
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
nice
beige
head
that
soon
became
a
thin
layer
and
left
a
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
toasted
grain
the
taste
was
sweet
upfront
with
toasted
malt
flavor
and
fairly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
with
good
carbonation
drinkabilty
was
good
this
was
a
decent
oktoberfest
d
not
bad
not
the
greatest
this
beer
is
worthy
enough
to
try
but
there
are
much
better
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
d
it
went
down
fine
but
im
surely
not
inclined
to
get
another
one
of
these
bummer
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
either
though
good
for
a
throwback
or
two
or
with
a
pizza
has
a
ruby
color
and
thick
beige
head
smells
earthy
and
malty
tastes
pretty
much
like
malt
too
with
the
occasional
spice
note
and
bitter
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
the
bubbles
hitting
the
tongue
it
isnt
too
heavy
for
more
then
a
couple
either
light
and
easily
drinkable
though
the
low
carbonation
which
as
mentioned
could
have
been
due
to
an
overly
aggressive
pour
keeps
it
from
being
quite
refreshing
enough
or
as
quaffable
as
spatens
original
version
drinkable
but
not
a
smooth
as
it
could
be
a
nice
enough
ofest
but
i
think
there
are
many
that
are
as
good
or
better
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
from
becks
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
toasty
grains
and
caramel
flavors
recommended
d
a
good
beer
i
like
the
sweetness
that
seems
to
be
missing
in
other
marzens
ive
had
recently
easy
to
drink
pours
a
solid
orange
with
billowy
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
smell
bready
malt
floral
fruity
pretty
restrained
taste
spicy
and
tealike
hops
toasted
malts
hints
of
caramel
finishes
sweet
but
a
little
thin
decent
even
in
a
green
bottle
it
avoids
the
importgrain
taste
of
a
spaten
but
a
little
thin
in
the
malts
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
color
to
a
nice
pillowy
head
that
dissipates
rather
fast
smell
was
almost
nonexistent
for
me
aside
from
a
few
floral
notes
taste
was
unexciting
and
almost
metallic
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
best
i
expected
better
from
a
renowned
german
brewery
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
acidic
drinkability
is
about
average
given
the
aftertaste
and
decent
abv
be
forwarned
though
i
would
say
this
is
a
onetimer
as
there
are
definitely
much
better
oktoberfest
brews
out
there
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
not
bad
at
all
just
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
d
drinakbility
was
respectable
and
surprisingly
good
a
nice
dry
semisweet
toasted
malting
with
a
flowery
hopping
makes
this
a
decent
example
per
style
and
one
you
can
easily
drink
with
little
or
no
complaints
worthy
of
a
try
looks
great
brilliant
amber
with
big
sturdy
head
smells
of
peaches
and
floral
hops
tasts
slight
toastedness
and
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
felt
this
one
was
well
on
the
light
side
not
quite
enough
malt
in
my
opinion
but
with
the
lightness
it
makes
it
go
down
easy
and
still
enjoyable
mfd
reasonable
price
and
good
flavor
make
this
one
a
fall
classic
highly
recommended
good
octoberfest
beer
some
brewers
get
it
right
others
dont
becks
got
it
right
my
only
complant
is
that
is
is
a
litle
light
on
flavor
and
feel
then
i
would
like
to
see
in
an
octoberfest
beer
in
my
opion
must
better
then
regualr
becks
worth
a
try
overall
weak
for
an
oktoberfest
but
still
drinkable
d
clearly
a
drinkable
beer
i
think
the
lack
of
a
good
finish
diminishes
it
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
pint
glass
the
brew
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
head
the
head
receded
somewhat
quickly
with
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
upon
tasting
the
malt
flavor
is
strong
up
front
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
the
body
is
light
with
little
carbonation
making
this
beer
easily
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
overall
becks
oktoberfest
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
that
i
enjoyed
it
is
not
the
tastiest
one
on
the
market
but
definately
worth
a
try
and
something
i
would
likely
pick
up
again

first
of
all
i
must
say
i
was
a
somewhat
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
had
becks
and
becks
dark
before
so
i
thought
i
had
an
idea
of
what
this
might
be
like
this
is
certainly
better
than
those
sampled
on
tap
dark
brown
appearance
with
semimalty
aroma
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
spices
mixed
in
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
its
not
bad
overall
this
was
pretty
solid
overall
not
bad
at
all
not
mind
blowing
but
still
more
then
decent
i
would
have
no
issue
with
throwing
down
another
one
at
anytime
definitely
a
respectable
brew
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
seasons
best
ive
yet
sampled
october
08
went
back
and
bought
another
as
its
the
season
of
oktobers
and
i
wanted
to
try
it
again
and
compare
after
having
had
a
bunch
of
the
style
the
smells
were
still
rather
faint
but
the
hoppiness
wasnt
quite
as
strong
nuttiness
and
maple
syrup
pushed
up
through
and
are
more
or
less
equal
to
the
hop
challenge
still
not
great
but
not
too
bad
either
why
dont
these
brewerys
stop
using
these
green
bottles
they
make
the
beer
taste
skunky
you
would
think
that
they
would
bottle
it
in
brown
bottles
to
keep
the
light
away
from
it
ohwell
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
maybe
its
just
the
wrong
time
of
year
to
be
drinking
it
go
figure
overall
not
a
great
oktoberfest
but
you
can
do
worse
not
recommended
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
nothing
really
good
most
of
this
this
beers
shortfalls
are
due
to
the
green
bottle
hopefully
this
is
better
on
tap
ill
keep
my
eye
out
now
i
do
like
oktoberfest
brews
but
this
is
the
second
straight
dissapointment
the
smell
was
a
bit
enticing
but
things
went
down
hill
from
there
i
enjoy
the
becks
dark
but
this
one
seemed
very
uneventful
and
had
an
awkward
taste
that
lingered
about
i
havent
been
able
to
pin
it
down
yet
but
i
m
not
going
to
drink
another
to
find
out
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
just
that
ive
come
to
expect
more
oktoberfest
in
january
not
too
bad
bottle
smell
is
delicious
with
malty
smell
of
caramel
and
toffee
pours
to
an
orange
bronze
with
a
very
light
tan
head
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
toffee
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
right
from
the
start
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
with
some
sparkle
the
is
an
amazingly
well
balanced
oktoberfest
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
too
sweet
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
the
taste
is
consistent
from
start
to
finish
with
a
slightly
dry
and
moderately
subdued
bitter
finish
this
is
a
darn
good
brew
a
sessioner
without
a
doubt
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
yearround
if
available
i
found
it
nestled
with
a
bunch
of
twelvers
of
becks
dark
i
was
pondering
good
find
reddish
orange
color
with
thin
foamy
head
about
half
a
finger
width
the
smell
was
actually
of
autumn
leaves
and
oak
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
either
there
was
tastes
of
hard
woods
dry
autumn
leaves
and
burnt
hops
the
feel
in
the
mouth
was
cold
and
crisp
which
turned
into
a
warm
feeling
as
it
was
being
swallowed
very
much
like
autumn
seriously
i
am
not
trying
to
be
cliche
i
was
as
surprised
as
you
are
the
drinkability
was
wonderful
and
will
definitely
be
buying
more
di
could
drink
these
but
just
not
all
night
long
dont
know
what
the
alcohol
content
was
but
it
seemed
to
give
me
a
nice
buzz
after
a
few
yuk
i
havent
had
a
becks
beer
in
20
years
with
good
reason
but
when
i
saw
their
octoberfest
i
thought
i
would
approach
this
with
an
open
mind
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lacing
some
retention
and
thats
the
best
part
the
smell
is
a
nutty
chemically
lousy
malt
smell
and
the
taste
is
worse
there
is
a
slight
chestnut
or
almond
malt
taste
to
this
beer
but
it
isnt
particularly
good
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
and
i
dont
know
which
is
worse
the
fact
that
this
is
german
and
should
be
better
or
that
anyone
would
actually
pay
money
for
this
stuff
given
the
100s
of
great
local
beers
out
there
not
to
mention
imports
if
you
want
bad
beer
drink
a
budweiser
on
the
cheap
why
pay
imported
prices
for
something
so
poor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
creamy
mostly
watery
and
largely
inoffensive
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
just
not
there
for
me
this
is
a
one
and
done
and
im
pouring
the
remainder
down
the
drain
ill
wait
another
20
years
before
i
give
this
beer
another
looksie
watery
blandness
with
a
slight
carbonation
is
all
i
taste
there
is
no
distinct
maltiness
that
i
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
this
could
easily
be
an
iced
down
stella
artois
very
average
beer
pours
out
to
a
nice
amber
color
moderate
head
retention
smell
is
bicuity
not
overwheming
the
taste
dosent
have
the
sweet
maltiness
that
i
really
enjoy
in
other
classic
oktoberfests
but
overall
not
bad
light
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinkablitlity
this
beer
was
what
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
not
displeasing
but
i
doubt
ill
wake
up
craving
one
anytime
soon
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
at
all
i
think
many
bas
have
rated
this
lower
because
it
is
becks
but
i
have
had
many
far
worse
of
course
the
green
bottles
could
have
ruined
it
for
others
too
edit
92508
this
years
fest
seems
maltier
drier
and
a
bit
thicker
than
last
years
this
is
much
better
than
the
average
becks
lager
and
has
much
less
of
the
skunked
effect
this
one
is
a
bit
easier
to
drink
may
have
to
try
again
as
this
may
have
been
a
oneoff
bad
experience
on
tap
because
others
seem
to
think
worthwhile
probably
better
than
average
compared
to
all
the
oktoberfests
that
i
have
tried
this
season
starts
off
with
a
bold
mix
of
toated
malt
and
cereal
grains
in
the
aroma
with
light
earthy
hops
that
give
the
beer
some
extra
kick
flavor
follow
the
aromas
closely
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
more
toasty
but
the
grain
qualities
deter
from
the
overall
taste
the
hop
flavor
is
ligher
than
the
scent
is
in
the
aroma
but
does
offset
the
sweetness
barely
low
on
esters
or
any
common
sulfers
the
beer
feels
light
on
the
creaminess
allowing
the
grain
husk
astringency
to
come
through
more
and
more
as
the
beer
warms
caramelly
melanoidens
give
the
impression
of
a
traditional
decoction
mash
finishes
a
little
grainy
but
with
a
balanced
hop
malt
flavor
that
fades
away
in
a
colalike
fashion
decided
to
give
this
one
another
try
last
year
my
rating
was
a
2
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
time
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
white
head
flavor
and
aroma
were
both
a
malty
sweetness
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
an
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
another
oktoberfest
beer
and
a
becks
version
at
that
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
with
rushing
carbonation
head
recedes
pretty
quickly
mellow
caramel
on
the
nose
smells
nice
like
a
marzen
should
sweet
caramel
in
the
taste
not
much
bitterness
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
good
marzen
i
have
to
say
i
am
surprised
as
this
is
coming
from
becks
maybe
the
most
macro
of
german
beer
better
than
i
was
expecting
is
not
bad
at
all
just
be
sure
you
get
a
fresh
one
and
do
mind
the
green
glass
d
a
good
drinking
beer
slightly
bitter
later
on
but
did
not
really
take
away
from
the
taste
or
the
overall
drinking
pleasure
i
had
from
drinking
the
beer
definitely
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
go
cheers
d
i
found
this
very
drinkable
only
bought
one
bottle
could
easily
go
through
a
six
pack
in
one
session
taste
very
light
and
balanced
hop
bitter
leads
off
moving
to
noble
hop
flavor
then
balanced
by
light
bready
malt
this
is
a
refreshing
example
on
the
light
side
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
much
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
clearish
copper
color
with
the
standard
barpoured
12
head
not
much
aroma
perceived
but
the
taste
was
there
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
well
balanced
flavors
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
the
marzen
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
karl
strauss
and
sam
adams
oktoberfest
may
be
true
to
style
but
just
not
my
mug
of
beer
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
in
a
good
way
it
pours
a
pretty
nice
amber
and
the
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
some
other
oktoberfest
beers
but
malty
and
pretty
true
to
the
style
the
taste
as
well
remained
true
to
the
style
sweet
malty
and
balanced
out
by
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
light
for
an
oktoberfest
but
didnt
take
that
much
away
from
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
not
as
great
as
paulner
or
hackerpschorr
but
not
to
far
off
from
those
either
would
purchase
this
beer
again
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
there
is
nothing
to
argue
against
this
beer
right
there
at
the
top
of
seasonal
beers
d
an
ok
oktoberfest
for
me
drinkable
but
really
nothing
special
about
it
to
differentiate
from
the
many
other
ubiquitous
oktoberfests
around
here
now
might
buy
a
couple
of
bottles
this
october
or
the
next
but
not
something
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
since
knowing
better
marzens
with
beefier
bodies
and
more
powerful
flavors
this
one
has
been
passed
over
year
after
year
and
tasting
this
bottle
i
remember
why
thank
goodness
it
was
free
d
a
little
too
much
carbonation
and
a
strange
mix
of
flavors
for
a
marzen
that
hurts
its
smoothness
somewhat
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
retains
an
average
head
tastes
a
bit
bitter
when
served
too
cold
after
waiting
for
it
to
warm
a
bit
has
a
nice
easygoing
oktoberfest
taste
very
mild
mannered
and
nice
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
overall
taste
a
bit
bland
but
overall
an
easygoing
drinkable
beer
for
the
season
pours
a
clean
reddish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
tight
and
long
lasting
sheets
of
lacing
line
the
inside
of
the
standard
pint
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
fresh
bread
floral
hop
aromas
hide
in
the
background
the
palate
is
on
the
sweet
malty
side
in
oktoberfest
fashion
but
does
contain
a
healthy
amount
of
herbalfloral
hop
balance
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
finish
is
nice
and
silky
with
low
acidity
and
only
moderate
carbonation
definitely
an
unchallenging
oktoberfest
but
doesnt
this
kind
of
define
the
style
as
it
is
now
really
quite
drinkable
and
much
more
flavorful
than
the
typical
becks
offerings
nice
overall
a
better
than
expected
oktoberfest
very
easy
to
drink
and
relatively
tasty
first
time
ive
seen
this
one
in
many
moons
and
i
find
it
pretty
average
as
a
beer
and
below
average
for
the
style
1
6er
will
do
it
for
me
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
barbeque
finish
to
this
beer
it
goes
down
like
water
and
none
of
that
annoying
gassy
aftereffect
it
had
full
flavor
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
am
a
big
fan
and
will
try
to
buy
a
case
of
this
shortly
d
all
oktoberfests
are
extremely
drinkable
by
definition
imo
and
this
is
no
exception
nothing
stands
out
as
a
superior
fest
brew
but
it
aint
bad
an
all
around
average
oktoberfest
beer
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
are
nothing
short
of
incredible
we
had
the
choice
of
the
aforementioned
dunkel
or
becks
oktoberfest
and
i
kept
going
back
to
the
becks
its
so
wellrounded
and
consistent
it
went
perfectly
with
beer
fest
enough
with
this
review
though
back
to
the
becks
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
a
beige
two
finger
head
with
a
normal
pour
head
fades
quickly
to
just
cover
the
beer
fruity
bready
smell
with
a
taste
of
chocolate
and
caramel
bready
malts
with
some
hops
to
balance
the
finish
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
is
there
just
a
good
tasting
smooth
and
balanced
beer
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
overall
an
average
ofest
there
are
better
and
worse
ones
out
there
how
come
becks
isnt
one
of
the
6
beers
served
at
oktoberfest
in
germany
because
theyre
not
from
munich
who
cares
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
one
can
buy
i
wait
each
year
for
it
to
become
available
at
my
local
beer
store
and
buy
most
of
what
gets
in
i
keep
it
in
my
basement
and
break
it
out
for
christmas
memorial
day
july
4th
festivities
my
friends
and
family
are
glad
i
hoared
this
stuff
and
save
it
for
special
times
with
special
people
dont
miss
out
on
this
if
you
appreciate
a
top
quality
marzenoktoberfest
style
brew
d
actually
better
than
i
expected
finishes
a
little
spicy
which
left
me
wanting
to
try
another
sip
each
time
id
say
its
worth
the
try
if
you
find
it
on
tap
suprisingly
good
beer
roasted
malt
flavor
slides
away
into
a
hoppy
bitterness
extremely
drinkable
really
really
solid
a
real
good
example
of
the
style
nothing
spectacular
just
done
pretty
damn
right
not
as
bold
with
the
flavors
as
some
like
but
all
in
all
decent
d
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
it
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
its
appearance
is
a
rich
and
clear
copperyamber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
was
an
averagelooking
brew
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
notable
caramel
and
malt
smells
theres
a
little
toast
and
sweetness
in
the
smell
with
very
little
hops
its
an
appropriate
and
enticing
aroma
but
a
little
faint
the
taste
is
bready
with
a
lightlytoasted
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
which
takes
away
from
the
experience
it
is
however
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
the
finish
is
balanced
and
clean
this
is
an
average
oktoberfest
good
but
there
are
many
that
are
better
certainly
an
oktoberfest
you
could
drink
all
day
long
but
not
very
thick
and
lacks
the
flavor
depth
that
id
like
overall
this
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
by
any
means
an
ok
ofest
a
bit
boring
and
not
as
malty
or
toasty
as
i
like
to
get
out
of
the
style
maybe
im
nitpicking
here
but
still
it
just
isnt
doing
to
much
for
me
edited
tried
this
again
and
liked
it
a
little
better
noticed
more
of
a
sweetcaramelapple
taste
to
it
not
bad
but
still
prefer
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
my
first
german
brewed
oktoberfest
of
the
fall
pours
a
very
bright
beautiful
copper
into
my
16
oz
pint
glass
the
white
head
is
very
thin
and
diminished
without
a
lace
after
the
first
two
sips
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
moderate
malty
sweetness
with
no
hop
aroma
maybe
a
little
bready
the
initial
taste
is
quite
malty
mainly
sweet
with
some
hints
of
toasted
grains
giving
it
a
slightly
spicy
edge
not
as
much
bready
like
the
aroma
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
providing
a
good
balance
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
which
i
usually
do
not
care
for
i
also
enjoyed
a
detectable
hop
flavor
and
this
was
appreciated
the
beer
is
delivered
on
a
moderate
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
giving
it
very
good
drinkability
for
an
oktoberfest
overall
i
enjoyed
this
oktoberfest
i
most
enjoyed
the
color
of
the
beer
and
taste
i
enjoy
the
slightly
spicy
notes
from
presumably
toasted
grains
following
the
initial
sweetness
and
liked
the
solid
balance
between
malt
and
hop
bitterness
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
nose
to
the
beer
it
has
much
better
flavor
than
aroma
the
medium
body
was
also
fine
with
me
although
some
times
id
prefer
a
more
fullbody
this
is
definitely
one
i
could
have
my
share
of
a
few
of
boots
drinkability
is
average
fresher
maybe
better
crisper
toastier
and
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
mk
overall
a
very
pleasing
beer
fantastic
option
to
go
with
a
nice
oktoberfest
dinner
nothing
to
complex
just
an
above
average
beer
of
the
style
definitly
a
beer
i
can
knock
back
more
then
one
of
overall
its
a
fairly
standard
and
enjoyable
oktoberfest
from
the
most
wellknown
german
beer
company
here
in
the
us
im
a
fan
of
becks
beer
and
this
one
doesnt
dissapoint
very
solid
while
not
in
the
same
caliber
as
the
bavarians
and
some
americans
it
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
and
considering
the
source
personally
i
think
the
becks
pale
lager
is
awful
and
the
dark
better
but
still
lacking
its
not
bad
at
all
i
have
this
almost
every
year
usually
through
friends
bringing
it
over
and
find
it
pretty
consistent
from
year
to
year
just
right
and
well
done
not
overdone
the
flavors
are
all
there
but
not
in
the
way
of
enjoyment
tastes
of
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
balancing
level
of
noble
hops
finishes
clean
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
unsatisfying
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
it
has
a
nice
color
but
average
for
an
oktoberfest
i
got
very
little
head
and
no
lace
after
the
head
was
gone
i
was
expecting
something
better
but
this
was
not
awful
just
a
smidge
above
average
dont
drink
and
review
mouthfeel
is
average
with
ample
amount
of
co2
and
is
a
great
fall
time
beer
i
usually
try
to
get
a
lot
of
this
style
around
this
time
of
year
and
it
hits
the
spot
coming
from
germany
i
thought
it
would
be
better
but
it
does
beat
some
american
oktoberfest
beers
working
my
way
through
this
style
at
last
one
i
can
give
a
favorable
review
typical
clear
amber
and
minimal
head
at
least
it
has
some
drinkability
in
that
its
the
first
of
my
samples
i
could
conceive
of
drinking
more
than
one
not
bad
at
all
much
better
than
the
victory
festbier
i
tried
last
night
pours
pale
amber
with
exceptional
clarity
fizzy
biege
two
finger
head
with
passing
retention
and
poor
lacing
green
bottle
aroma
is
evident
at
the
pour
but
fades
quickly
and
presents
a
bouquet
of
toasty
munich
malt
and
peach
fruitiness
overall
mild
aroma
with
no
hops
to
speak
of
mild
toasted
amber
malt
sweetness
upfront
met
with
skunk
and
faint
licorice
flavor
dry
aftertaste
some
saaz
flavor
but
mostly
a
bland
bitterness
the
thin
body
and
overly
crisp
carbonation
fall
far
short
of
the
typically
malty
and
robust
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
leaning
towards
the
bitter
end
slightly
offbalance
and
timid
in
flavor
this
may
be
fairly
drinkable
but
it
is
also
fairly
dissapointing
pours
ruby
tinged
amber
with
little
head
fairly
flat
carbonation
only
vague
aromas
of
sweet
malts
adultered
by
corn
perhaps
and
the
slightest
dusting
of
fruity
hops
very
forward
on
the
palate
light
malts
with
a
cloyingly
sweet
note
that
grows
to
unpleasant
proportions
by
the
end
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
showing
overall
this
beer
has
little
to
recommend
it
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
theres
nothing
terrible
about
it
and
its
certainly
drinkable
enough
with
a
choice
of
this
or
regular
becks
ill
take
this
anytime
well
i
tried
it
and
between
the
wifey
and
myself
well
finish
the
sixer
but
my
appetite
is
ready
for
some
tasty
ok
fests
highly
underrated
märzen
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
oktoberfest
out
there
unlike
the
typical
becks
pilsner
this
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
even
luminescent
bronzered
in
the
glass
with
a
head
that
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
a
layer
of
foam
on
the
top
also
unlike
many
oktoberfest
styles
that
are
very
malty
right
up
front
this
one
has
a
very
nice
balance
with
a
gentle
hops
bite
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
buds
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
and
a
very
slight
carmel
taste
but
an
extremely
favorable
if
subtle
bitterness
or
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
that
leaves
the
taste
buds
begging
for
more
the
smooth
slightly
carbonated
thinner
mouthful
completes
the
very
tasty
picture
happy
oktoberfest
strictly
based
on
how
many
id
enjoy
throwing
back
i
think
we
have
a
winner
here
there
is
nothing
really
special
about
its
appearance
or
smell
but
it
is
made
up
with
its
good
drinkability
and
distinct
european
oktoberfest
taste
this
beer
has
an
about
average
mouthfeel
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
is
a
little
over
the
top
but
thats
just
me
perhaps
a
little
less
carbonation
would
have
been
better
the
carbonation
gives
the
impression
that
the
body
is
fuller
than
it
actually
is
the
body
is
mediumlightly
full
but
not
quite
full
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
goes
down
smooth
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
buying
a
sixer
of
this
next
time
i
see
it
it
is
definitley
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
fall
it
seems
to
characterize
the
season
becks
oktoberfest
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
inoffensive
in
the
extreme
and
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
for
those
who
cant
find
anything
better
to
celebrate
the
oktoberfest
season
or
for
those
who
simply
arent
aware
that
much
better
beer
is
likely
to
be
lurking
within
arms
length
on
the
other
side
of
the
beer
cooler
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
last
year
this
review
is
for
the
tap
version
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
enjoyed
whilst
shooting
the
shit
with
my
father
a
lighet
shade
of
amber
with
a
12
head
of
fuzzy
white
foam
aromas
of
munich
malts
and
slightly
floral
german
hops
balanced
nicely
the
taste
is
balanced
and
sweet
with
the
malts
and
the
hops
working
together
nicely
to
serve
as
a
refreshing
beverage
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
an
ofest
and
drinkability
is
good
hey
its
not
the
best
ofest
out
there
but
it
is
tasty
enough
what
did
you
expect
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
unfortunately
it
is
packaged
in
a
green
bottle
but
does
not
seem
to
be
light
struck
has
a
nice
aroma
and
really
nice
malty
taste
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
given
their
other
offerings
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
would
drink
it
again
pretty
similar
to
spatens
oktoberfest
a
little
less
flavorful
average
average
average
but
then
i
expected
nothing
more
this
beer
was
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
color
decently
carbonated
and
crystal
clear
the
head
that
was
produced
was
white
to
off
white
in
color
decent
foam
somewhat
fluffy
and
airy
but
not
well
lasting
and
no
real
lace
present
to
be
honest
not
what
i
would
have
thought
for
this
type
of
beer
i
even
sent
it
back
saying
that
it
was
not
what
i
ordered
and
it
must
have
been
bud
but
i
watched
her
pour
and
it
was
the
aroma
was
rather
weak
some
malt
and
spices
and
some
citrus
hops
but
all
real
faint
the
flavors
were
not
much
more
then
the
aromas
some
malts
alitttle
crisp
but
not
much
as
far
as
depth
for
this
style
of
beer
from
beginning
to
end
average
at
best
and
weak
for
the
style
lght
in
body
somewhat
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
a
decent
regular
pilsner
styled
beer
but
not
one
for
the
typical
fall
classic
not
one
for
me
to
get
again
the
body
is
light
to
medium
a
interesting
taste
but
overall
limited
taste
this
was
a
nice
surprise
a
good
oktoberfest
from
becks
inconceivable
little
to
no
body
but
still
a
quaffable
brew
if
only
because
it
is
innoffensive

a
becks
not

this

i
picked
this
one
up
at
applebees
the
other
day
and
found
to
be
a
medocre
beer
this
one
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
slightly
rocky
head
i
only
could
smell
caramel
and
it
tasted
predominatly
of
lemon
spice
and
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
i
had
two
and
found
them
to
be
enjoyable
very

no

doesnt

like
much
a
little

some
toastedness
and
some
troubling
hints

to
come
becks
oktoberfest
does
not
taste
good
a
harsh
bitter
metallic
flavor
clings
to
the
back
of
your
tongue
with
a
hint
of
wet
dog
as
its
accomplice
does
have
a
nice
toasted
character
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wet
toasted
metal
dogs
i
thought
the
becks
offering
in
2004
was
surprisingly
good
this
one
falls
down
alot
while
the
appearance
is
ok
for
an
ofest
everything
else
was
very
subpar
not
recommended
go
for
a
sam
adams
or
one
of
the
much
better
other
german
imports
hopefully
becks
will
do
better
in
2006
becks
oktoberfest
started
out
with
some
promise
it
poured
a
clean
amber
color
and
had
a
white
head
that
sat
well
on
the
glass
the
head
however
dissolved
rapidly
becoming
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
did
not
alce
well
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
less
caramel
like
than
i
would
have
expected
and
had
a
pronounced
hop
nose
an
off
characteristic
for
this
beer
style
the
taste
was
very
bitter
with
an
earthy
tone
to
it
there
was
little
malt
character
to
this
beverage
and
was
carried
on
the
back
of
the
hop
additions
the
mouthfeel
for
such
a
robust
beer
proved
to
be
on
the
light
side
for
this
oktoberfest
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
average
it
would
make
a
good
party
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
have
a
fall
themed
party
and
not
worried
about
savoring
the
brew
wow
this
one
still
seems
to
change
from
year
to
year
and
not
for
the
better

where
did

go
finish
is

brew
with
a
very
short

a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
drinkable
this
was
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
though
the
smell
scared
me
pretty
good
the
appearance
was
pretty
nice
actually
it
was
a
good
clean
amberbrownish
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
head
started
out
pretty
big
and
fluffy
but
later
dies
out
to
a
laceing
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
buttery
the
warmer
it
was
the
better
it
was
though
when
it
was
colder
it
seemed
a
little
soapy
along
with
the
butteresque
taste
came
caramel
a
little
honey
and
some
lighter
fruits
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
taste
to
it
as
well
the
smell
was
a
little
bit
hoppy
with
the
escesnse
of
skunk
interlaced
overall
a
nice
brew
all
and
all
a
great
beer
id
like
to
try
it
on
bottle
to
see
what
the
differences
are
the
taste
is
dry
and
malty
with
a
bitter
finish
the
feeling
in
the
mouth
is
clean
and
medium
bodied
this
went
down
really
easy
and
lead
to
a
second
pint
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
solid
offering
overallafter
having
sam
adams
version
i
was
excited
to
try
an
oktoberfest
from
a
german
company
but
unfortunetely
becks
version
seems
too
dubbed
down
and
safe
to
me
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
respect
but
just
didnt
hit
me
with
a
kick
of
flavors
and
complexity
like
i
hoped
this
beer
warrants
a
try
but
i
for
one
was
dissapointed
oddly
hoppy
for
an
okotberfest
brew
maybe
because
it
is
from
germany
afterall
that
is
where
the
style
originated
and
we
have
our
own
americanized
versions
it
pours
a
translucent
amber
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissipaitating
head
what
stood
out
in
its
appearance
was
the
carbonation
there
are
a
lot
of
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
the
carbonation
was
verified
after
my
first
sip
also
the
hops
overwhelm
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
so
much
that
i
cannot
notice
much
else
in
there
the
flavor
and
finish
actually
reminded
me
more
of
a
lager
my
buddy
who
brought
them
over
concurred
in
that
assessment
the
long
trip
must
have
did
this
beer
bad
the
pour
was
a
nice
orange
amber
with
a
decent
head
lacing
was
nice
the
smell
was
sweet
but
lacking
definition
picked
up
slight
spice
but
no
real
standout
the
taste
seemed
very
caramelly
and
sweet
but
with
no
real
added
pizazz
a
little
to
syrupy
for
my
liking
in
the
end
it
smoothed
out
like
a
lager
different
edit
well
the
bottle
i
had
last
night
was
a
little
more
tasty
so
i
gave
it
another
5
still
nothing
like
the
old
though
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
beige
shortlived
head
leaving
some
froth
malty
nose
with
some
faint
fruity
notes
and
a
mineral
background
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
faintly
hoppy
in
the
finish
providing
enough
bitterness
to
linger
carbonation
is
good
and
keeps
it
crisp
not
the
best
oktoberfestbier
ive
tried
but
not
bad
seems
a
little
underpolished
or
overproduced
one
of
the
two
taste
is
very
flat
and
uninteresting
it
reminds
me
of
low
quality
white
bread
with
nothing
on
it
to
hide
its
taste
its
just
sort
of
grainy
and
lifeless
bender
factor
good
session
beer
suprised
me
heads
above
saranac
oktoberfest
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
high
carbonation
burps
and
the
skunky
bitterness
very
disappointing
tastes
a
bit
too
raw
for
an
oktoberfest
maybe
it
needs
a
bit
more
lagering
time
to
really
smooth
out
and
go
from
an
average
oktoberfeststyle
beer
to
a
good
one
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
slightly
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
scent
that
lingers
with
a
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
yet
slightly
malty
flavor
with
a
lager
yeast
finish
it
lacks
a
more
malty
presence
and
finishes
a
little
too
dry
and
bitter
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
tastes
too
clean
cut
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
less
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
fest
beer
but
it
could
be
a
lot
better
it
lacks
real
flavor
and
sells
itself
short
for
a
more
commercial
taste
this
beer
had
superb
clarity
with
a
generous
amount
of
carbonation
a
thin
white
head
formed
quickly
on
top
of
the
beer
then
dissolved
away
quickly
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
light
and
lemony
hop
note
the
taste
is
light
and
has
some
caramel
sweetness
lightly
caramelized
malt
body
with
a
bittersweet
and
slightly
spicy
malt
finish
not
bad
light
and
drinkable
solid
oktoberfest
beer
im
glad
i
sampled
this
one
tonight
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
i
found
it
vvery
drinkable
a
good
fall
back
in
the
autumn
had
ontap
at
the
germanamerican
fest
in
chicago
on
draught
at
winking
lizard
pours
a
rich
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
nuts
lighter
body
than
most
oktoberfest
beers
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
along
with
caramel
and
nuts
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
it
is
not
very
pronounced
at
all
the
finish
is
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
a
somewhat
weak
example
of
the
style
however
it
isnt
really
offensive
in
any
way
original
rating
82802
average
all
the
way
around
slight
taste
of
roasted
malt
with
some
caramel
thrown
in
nothing
makes
this
jump
out
at
you
but
its
not
bad
either
better
than
regular
becks
a
good
overall
octoberfest
brew
interesting
taste
never
had
it
on
tap
but
i
imagine
it
owuld
be
very
very
good
but
it
keeps
in
with
the
octoberfest
tradition
of
being
a
thick
tasty
beer
that
was
meant
to
be
enjoyed
not
chugged
i
lookj
forward
to
picking
up
a
6
pack
every
october
poured
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
on
it
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
at
the
end
smell
consisted
of
sweet
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
a
little
bit
weak
but
not
bad
taste
was
decent
enough
toasted
malts
and
sweet
caramel
hit
the
palate
first
and
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
there
was
some
hops
toward
the
middle
and
end
but
very
weak
and
could
use
a
little
bit
more
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
sweetness
was
a
little
cloying
at
times
but
it
wasnt
overboard
for
a
macro
import
this
is
not
a
bad
offering
a
fresh
six
pack
during
the
fall
time
could
make
this
very
ideal
give
it
a
shot
i
liked
the
bitterness
but
the
overall
experience
was
not
as
good
as
the
smell
and
appearance
led
me
to
believe
anyway
this
beer
smells
pretty
good
nice
warm
soft
munich
malt
notes
flavor
is
quite
nice
really
nice
malty
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
really
fairly
dry
but
the
mouthfeel
is
still
quite
smooth
and
not
too
thin
really
drinkable
drinkability
is
ok
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
actually
this
is
not
a
great
oktoberfest
by
any
means
but
it
is
drinkable
just
not
sure
i
will
have
any
need
to
buy
it
again
drinkability

they
did
a
good
job
with
the
style
but
the
grain
was
a
little
subpar
for
my
tastes
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definately
drink
it
again
it
goes
down
easy
after
that
initial
heafty
amount
of
carbonation
you
get
from
the
bottle
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
oktoberfest
brew
not
on
par
with
the
toptier
ofests
but
not
one
id
pass
on
either
this
one
poured
a
dark
copper
that
was
transparent
with
a
small
head
to
match
the
smell
of
this
beer
told
me
nothing
and
the
taste
didnt
really
wow
me
either
but
it
was
good
enough
pretty
balanced
leaning
slightly
toward
the
malty
side
kind
of
a
thin
body
to
it
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
over
the
top
oktoberfests
and
this
easy
going
oktoberfest
was
alright
to
me
had
this
on
tap
at
three
dollar
deweys
had
never
seen
it
before
which
meant
only
one
thing
review
nice
dark
golden
when
poured
no
head
bready
aroma
i
noticed
a
medium
body
slightly
caramelly
and
no
stringency
not
bad
just
not
a
real
wower
pat
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
the
smell
is
a
faint
malty
aroma
with
just
a
little
floral
hint
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
some
spice
very
weak
though
the
body
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
fairly
nice
just
an
average
oktoberfest
one
more
selection
is
my
quest
to
sample
as
many
oktoberfests
from
germany
as
possible
this
year
not
as
good
as
the
others
though
pours
a
honeycopper
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
has
a
strong
sweet
honey
aroma
taste
is
initially
a
bit
metallic
but
has
some
notes
of
sweet
corn
and
honey
to
smooth
it
out
it
doesnt
get
any
more
complex
than
that
and
then
the
metallic
flavor
comes
back
big
in
the
aftertaste
which
turned
me
off
to
this
beer
entirely
this
is
very
drinkable
but
a
little
too
mild
for
my
taste
if
you
get
it
for
a
good
price
you
wont
be
disappointed
sitting
in
sun
by
the
fountain
gazing
at
the
bavarian
decor
in
overdrive
that
is
the
german
section
of
epcot
even
the
pleasant
surroundings
could
not
salvage
this
very
average
beer
from
mediocrity
nondescript
roasted
malt
flavors
with
some
caramel
notes
the
overall
flavor
profile
was
harsh
and
not
very
festive
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
this
is
an
ok
beer
as
an
oktoberfest
it
is
lacking
ooomph
the
appearance
is
lacking
in
head
retention
the
head
looks
promising
but
disappears
rapidly
and
tries
to
leave
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
green
bottle
funk
and
rough
munich
malt
not
bad
but
not
that
great
either
flavor
is
that
signature
cheap
eurolager
flavor
with
an
anemic
contribution
of
munich
malt
finishes
dry
and
steely
wrong
an
ok
beer
as
far
as
beers
go
in
general
but
a
pisspoor
excuse
for
a
marzenoktoberfest
acceptable
with
reservations
prost
prost
i
know
becks
is
seen
as
a
product
of
the
evil
empire
interbrew
but
they
can
produce
good
beers
and
this
is
one
of
them
unlike
the
spaten
the
green
bottle
didnt
contribute
to
a
lightstruck
taste
which
i
suppose
means
something
and
it
definitely
doesnt
seem
like
becks
simply
dropped
some
food
coloring
in
their
lager
that
said
this
isnt
a
great
oktoberfest
but
not
a
terrible
one
either
a
decent
octoberfest
a
great
beer
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
craft
brewed
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
that
doesnt
really
challenge
your
palate
too
much
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
not
half
bad
but
there
are
way
better
german
brewed
marzens
out
there
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
local
oktoberfest
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
it
had
a
slightly
citrusy
smell
to
it
along
with
hops
the
flavor
was
very
good
it
had
a
nice
citrus
bite
to
it
especially
as
it
warmed
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
beer
but
not
the
best
youll
find
either
its
crystalclear
copper
body
is
topped
by
a
short
but
creamy
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
drops
fairly
quickly
to
a
wide
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
it
does
however
leave
some
interesting
lacing
the
nose
displays
a
rich
bready
caramelish
and
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
subtle
background
of
floral
hops
its
medium
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
that
lends
just
enough
bite
to
get
things
started
spicy
and
grassy
hops
start
the
flavor
with
some
zest
before
the
malts
start
to
warm
and
carry
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
the
malt
isnt
quite
as
rich
as
the
nose
suggests
but
it
is
nicely
toasty
and
not
so
bold
that
it
builds
on
the
palate
in
fact
between
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
the
lowlevel
bitterness
and
the
character
of
the
malt
this
is
one
hell
of
a
balanced
drinkable
beer
very
well
done
overall
quite
average
to
be
honest
a
reasonably
clean
drink
that
has
a
very
light
nose
taste
profile
and
mouthfeel
this
lends
some
drinkability
but
it
is
really
rather
an
average
oktoberfest
that
i
suspect
is
brewed
to
appeal
to
a
wider
audience
and
as
such
may
be
a
little
too
tame
for
some
oktoberfest
fans

no

the

was
ok
with
some
slight

firts

it

soem
decent

and
was

then

it

saying
paulener
here
i
come
nice
malty
textrue
like
an
oktoberfest
but
the
smell
and
color
are
noticably
lighter
this
looks
like
one
of
the
modern
okto
beers
which
get
paler
every
year
to
please
the
bud
drinking
contingent
not
really
memorable
but
okay
and
a
little
typical
of
becks
megabrew
approach
very
clear
amber
colored
brew
that
poured
with
a
tall
head
that
retreated
to
about
a
14
inch
foam
layer
that
lingered
and
left
lace
pretty
high
level
of
carbonation
evident
as
the
foam
was
constantly
replenished
by
bubbles
from
below
smelled
faintly
grassy
and
fresh
the
taste
was
quite
light
and
a
bit
sour
due
to
the
high
level
of
carbonation
more
hoppy
than
typical
oktoberfest
style
beers
but
not
overly
so
a
bit
lacking
in
character
but
overall
a
decent
session
beer
just
about
what
i
would
expect
from
becks
its
wonderful
pours
a
reddish
colour
almost
like
tea
has
an
almost
sweet
smell
to
it
almost
remnicent
of
brown
sugar
nice
thick
head
at
first
but
dissipates
quickly
even
though
the
head
dissolves
quickly
theres
still
moderate
to
heavy
lacing
of
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
of
a
medium
weight
if
that
makes
any
sense
thats
the
only
way
i
know
how
to
describe
it
seems
to
me
to
have
a
smooth
but
almost
heavy
finish
also
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
most
other
brews
any
how
a
wonderful
brew
nevertheless
i
highly
recomend
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
germanwestern
european
beer
my
style
not
my
octoberfest
bier
a
decent
look
of
dark
amber
and
red
hues
the
offwhite
head
and
light
lacing
werepresent
if
unimpressive
smell
is
straightfoward
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
coming
through
in
the
taste
i
like
more
bite
and
a
more
fullbodied
sense
in
this
style
the
feel
is
far
too
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
limited
by
this
factor
beer
was
kind
of
an
ofest
light
decent
malt
based
sweetness
but
not
really
enough
heft
to
be
a
truly
good
oktoberfest
offering
i
overheard
one
of
the
local
germans
comment
on
the
beer
he
basically
said
that
you
cant
expect
a
northern
german
brewery
to
make
a
great
oktoberfest
perhaps
hes
right
still
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
becks
beers
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
really
not
that
bad
thin
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkabilty
round
out
the
beer
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
an
oktoberfest
but
it
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
would
go
well
with
some
brats
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
altogether
but
it
just
fails
to
excite
me
becks
should
brew
this
all
year
round
to
help
round
out
their
lineup
appears
amber
brown
with
af

metallic
with

mild

malts
and
a

profile
flavor
has
the
toasted
malts
balanced
by
a
sharp
bitterness

but
i
like
more

an
oktoberfest

not
to

make

it
was
clear

in

years
euro
long
neckstyle
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
the
finish
to
me
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
not
a
real
beck
fan
and
this
is
a
beck
clear
glass
bottle
with
best
before
072003
so
this
beer
wasnt
old
but
tasted
somewhat
skunky
unfortunately
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
14
inch
head
that
retreated
in
seconds
aroma
consisted
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
hops
the
qualities
of
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
oktoberfest
are
vaguely
similar
to
that
of
an
original
becks
the
finish
was
skunky
and
rather
bitter
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
it
was
a
letdown
i
would
probably
try
to
seek
this
out
on
tap
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
tasting
than
what
was
offered
in
the
bottle
this
years
offering
is
just
as
appealing
as
last
years
but
for
other
reasons
the
well
bittering
but
just
not
as
sweat
pleasant
fresh
aroma
more
closely
associated
with
a
german
pilsner
than
oktoberfest
with
a
light
flowery
character
and
not
much
malt
thick
full

amberorange

clear
light
to

with

quality
has
a
refreshing
quench
to
it
as
well
shorter
than
average
finish
for
style
with
some
dryness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
doesnt
have
any
softness
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
i
do
prefer
this
to
the
other
beck
offerings
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
light
head
that
quickly
dissipates
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
once
poured
into
a
glass
being
from
clear
bottles
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
a
bit
skunky
but
fortunately
that
was
not
the
case
the
flavor
was
not
that
impressivesimilar
to
regular
becks
but
with
more
of
a
roasted
malt
and
nutty
flavor
there
are
definitely
better
oktoberfests
to
be
had
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
marzen
didnt
have
any
of
the
bready
and
spicy
characteristics
i
look
for
in
the
style
pours
a
mediumlight
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
toasty
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
lightmedium
body
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
taste
was
of
bready
maltiness
with
hints
of
carmel
ending
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
very
easy
to
drink
especially
compared
to
regular
becks
which
is
a
fight
for
me
to
swallow
a
bit
thin
but
better
than
expected
very
clean
and
not
as
sweet
as
american
oktoberfests
deep
copper
color
little
head
and
no
lace
typical
becks
aroma
with
an
undertone
of
caramel
malt
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
buttery
goodness
the
accentuates
the
caramel
malts
used
tastes
great
my
favorite
becks
by
far
the
taste
is
perfect
for
an
ofest
hops
are
flowery
malts
are
sugary
sweet
and
balanced
oh
so
smooth
for
a
mass
produced
becks
product
this
is
a
very
good
buy
especially
if
you
like
the
euro
taste
of
lagers
easy
to
quaff
many
of
these
the
nicest
quality
of
this
beer
is
the
spicy
aroma
it
also
pours
with
a
nice
color
which
is
copper
topped
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
the
taste
is
a
little
lacking
it
has
some
malt
but
just
not
exciting
and
malty
like
most
oktoberfests
the
finish
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
mnay
better
ofests
available
becks
presents
a
mild
mannered
drinkable
oktoberfest
the
color
is
probably
the
most
unique
characteristic
of
this
lager
the
subtle
but
rather
sensual
tint
of
this
beverage
is
a
beautiful
copper
the
initial
scent
was
a
bit
skunky
accompanied
with
a
light
citrus
note
overall
it
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
beer
that
finishes
a
bit
weak
on
the
palate
drinkable
yes
the
best
no
becks
ofest
its
been
done
a
skunked
out
eurolager
with
a
handful
of
oktoberfest
spices
really
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
looked
just
fine
but
cmon
its
just
bad
it
had
the
underlying
taste
of
becks
bad
and
skunked
with
a
very
limited
level
of
ofest
malts
thrown
in
the
mix
worst
ofest
ever
a
better
becks
but
not
a
great

entry
from
the

of

not
a
becks
fan
to
begin
with
although
this
is
probably
their
best
beer
they
brilliantly
decided
to
use
clear
bottles
this
year
with
a
faint
green
tinge
but
are
selling
them
in
enclosed
12
packs
skunky
aroma
which
fortunately
vacated
when
dumped
into
mug
some
good
head
coloration
but
a
bit
too
artificially
fizzy
to
be
truly
handsome
very
cold
this
beer
had
some
good
caramel
sweetness
in
the
attack
but
everything
else
is
a
wash
as
the
beer
warmed
to
the
appropriate
temperature
the
bad
flavors
became
more
obvious
too
much
regular
becks
flavor
which
i
find
disgusting
also
an
offensive
metallic
aftertaste
much
the
same
effect
as
sucking
on
a
quarter
that
you
picked
up
off
the
street
will
have
to
recruit
some
friends
to
finish
this
12
pack
for
me
should
have
known
what
to
expect
from
becks
everything
about
becks
oktoberfest
seemed
a
tad
too
subdued
aside
from
the
great
looking
copperycinnamon
color
and
the
offwhite
head
nothing
jumped
out
and
said
wow
the
nose
was
of
faint
malt
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
matched
up
with
the
aroma
add
in
a
little
floral
too
i
think
i
could
smell
and
taste
a
faint
note
of
skunk
it
got
a
little
sweet
at
the
end
but
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
by
no
means
is
there
anything
wrong
with
it
ill
gladly
drink
another
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
very
light
tan
head
over
a
nice
looking
amberteacolored
brew
the
nose
is
malty
grassy
very
fresh
too
taste
is
great
a
bold
maltiness
followed
by
a
flowery
fresh
hoppiness
and
some
light
roasted
malt
tones
the
finish
is
wonderfully
balanced
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
a
great
example
of
a
wellmade
german
ofest
everything
is
turned
up
to
10
on
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
pillowy
head
and
ok
lacing
nice
toasty
malt
aroma
with
some
light
noble
hop
scents
as
well
taste
stays
pretty
solid
all
the
way
through
a
malty
toasty
foundation
with
some
lighter
hop
profile
floating
on
the
surface
that
makes
for
an
excellently
balanced
brew
and
a
surprisingly
nice
ofest
the
brew
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
that
is
about
the
only
detraction
of
this
very
drinkable
bier
323
ill
let
this
one
go
in
the
future
spaten
is
better
this
beer
pours
a
nice
orangishcopper
color
with
a
relatively
creamy
head
that
is
shortlived
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
perhaps
a
little
caramel
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
but
it
has
hints
of
malt
caramel
and
some
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
that
does
bring
the
drinkability
up
a
bit
this
isnt
a
bad
representation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
but
it
could
certainly
be
improved
i
was
not
sure
of
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
as
far
as
it
accuracy
to
style
at
least
it
looks
like
an
oktoberfest
nice
amber
coloring
with
small
head
the
aroma
had
a
slight
skunk
along
with
some
caramel
maltiness
and
hop
notes
the
taste
is
not
malty
enough
for
the
style
and
the
body
is
too
thin
if
you
are
looking
for
an
oktoberfest
keep
looking
if
you
want
a
drinkable
beer
in
a
pinch
go
ahead
picked
this
up
because
egad
it
was
the
only
ofest
beer
at
the
liquor
store
this
past
weekend
whats
the
holdup
guys
anyway
on
just
about
every
count
this
is
an
average
beer
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
light
browncaramel
in
color
translucent
with
a
dissipating
offwhite
head
smell
is
clean
mildly
malty
pleasant
caramel
taste
though
a
bit
thin
which
in
some
respects
adds
to
its
drinkability
nothing
outstanding
here
but
not
bad
either
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
on
the
nose
slight
caramel
malt
aroma
and
slightly
nutty
on
the
palate
the
same
caramel
malt
can
be
tasted
nice
sweetness
grainy
soft
hop
flavors
slight
nutty
flavor
alsowell
rounded
ofestvery
good
i
wasnt
expecting
much
to
this
brew
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
this
was
a
tasty
festbier
a
little
thinner
than
the
really
good
ones
but
has
enough
sweet
tasting
somewhat
nutty
malt
flavor
to
be
interesting
finishes
dry
good
oktober
went
down
with
a
nice
maltiness
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
bitter
it
had
a
somewhat
dark
flavor
which
i
really
enjoyed
i
would
not
say
this
was
up
there
with
the
top
oktoberfests
but
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
the
dark
malts
in
this
one
but
going
back
to
a
few
other
oktobers
made
me
realize
that
the
body
was
too
light
and
it
was
not
as
rich
and
smooth
as
it
should
be
to
join
the
ranks
no
discernable
hop
or
fermentation
profile
musty
slightly
sweet
malt
nose
amber
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
big
force
carbonation
and
a
white
head
with
shades
of
yellow
bland
watery
and
slightly
cardboard
tasting
oxidized
with
a
ok
malt
base
this
was
dissapointing
on
the
malt
side
and
did
not
have
much
character
octoberfests
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
in
my
mind
there
arent
any
real
bad
octoberfests
becks
is
solid
but
far
from
my
favorite
its
a
little
thinner
than
some
of
the
others
easy
drinking
though
has
that
european
hop
taste
im
not
a
hop
expert
but
it
is
that
traditional
european
flavor
some
nice
maltiness
to
it
but
as
i
mentioned
not
as
sweet
and
chewy
as
some
of
the
others
if
you
like
basic
german
lagers
becksst
pauli
this
would
be
a
nice
step
up
in
flavor
and
character
its
good
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
octoberfest
list
somewhat
of
a
surprise
when
i
first
had
this
beer
not
a
bad
pick
and
one
ill
go
back
to
notes
give
that
this
is
a
becks
its
a
great
oktoberfestbier
drinkable
flavourful
addictive
delicious

the

1

served

head
lasted
for
most
of
the
beer
good
body
and
outstanding
mouth
feel
another
excellent
beer
by
bbc
great
caramelized
malt
taste
with
smooth
balanced
hop
finish
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
an
extremely
well
done
oktoberfest
and
one
i
really
look
forward
to
having
again
ill
need
to
pick
up
a
whole
bottle
of
this
and
see
how
the
edginess
asserts
itself
when
served
in
a
proper
glass
and
whatnot
or
over
time
as
it
ages
would
highly
recommend
45
o
i
was
surprised
at
the
booziness
since
the
abv
isnt
all
that
high
the
finish
is
more
bitter
than
most
and
i
enjoyed
that
o
overall
slightly
unimpressed
by
this
one
its
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
solid
octoberfest
brew
and
real
good
on
tap
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
orange
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
behind
smell
is
brown
sugar
raisin
banana
bread
and
carmel
taste
is
balanced
nicely
this
is
large
for
the
style
and
malt
lovers
will
love
what
they
have
done
here
body
is
on
the
large
side
a
little
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
a
well
done
marzen
style
beer
if
you
like
malty
beers
and
october
beers
a
must
try
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
just
not
to
my
liking
after
one
serving
i
really
have
very
little
desire
to
drink
any
more
this
is
the
first
berkshire
brew
ive
ever
felt
that
way
about
it
would
probably
be
worth
looking
for
another
marzen
to
see
if
its
more
to
do
with
the
style
that
doesnt
click
for
me
rather
than
just
this
one
beer
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
malty
like
a
good
oktoberfestmarzen
should
but
then
an
unexpected
earthy
bitterness
flies
in
from
out
of
left
field
and
takes
it
all
over
that
bitterness
lingers
overall
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
great
beer
fresh
easy
to
drink
octoberfest
look
forward
to
it
every
year
poured
my
first
one
of
the
year
and
just
as
good
as
last
year
the
people
at
berkshire
really
take
pride
in
there
brewing
process
and
it
shows
with
every
great
beer
i
would
take
this
over
than
almost
any
other
german
octoberfest
nothing
like
kicking
back
on
a
cool
night
pouring
one
these
into
a
pint
glass
and
watching
football
great
brew
o
this
beer
met
my
expectations
as
they
were
pretty
high
when
i
purchased
it
a
very
good
beer
by
itself
and
for
the
style
id
recommended
it
to
anyone
odone
of
the
best
marzens
i
have
run
across
actually
this
one
probably
is
my
favorite
berkshire
has
some
great
brews
happy
to
have
tried
it
the
style
is
weak
but
this
one
is
a
star
o
solid
strong
octobrew
from
bbc
wasnt
really
big
on
the
sweetness
however
but
still
an
alright
beer
watch
out
for
the
abv
though
itll
sneek
up
on
ya
originally
reviewed
09192011
d
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
berkshire
and
competitive
with
the
better
local
oktoberfests
ive
had
still
itd
be
hard
to
pick
out
of
a
lineup
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
lager
and
a
really
enjoyable
marzen
lots
of
malts
and
could
have
drank
the
whoel
bomber
by
myself
would
certainly
have
it
again
o
a
bit
one
note
but
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
poured
a

hazy

very
mild

the

well
done
oktoberfest
lager
very
creamy
feel
with
a
good
medium
body
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
the
feel
perfect
overall
very
tasting
although
this
one
seems
to
be
much
stronger
and
heavier
than
the
ones
coming
from
germany
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
what
a
great
albeit
strong
octoberfest
lager
well
done
recommended
overall
a
very
good
oktoberfest
i
really
wanted
to
rate
this
one
a
bit
higher
but
that
damn
alcohol
kick
in
the
taste
just
wouldnt
let
me
do
it
who
decided
to
put
alcohol
in
this
stuff
anyway
perhaps
another
month
of
storage
wouldve
helped
this
guy
mellow
out
a
touch
more
regardless
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
and
would
not
hesitate
to
give
it
another
shot
im
gonna
revisit
this
one
for
sure
another
quality
brew
from
berkshire
one
of
the
best
domestic
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
encountered
though
different
enough
from
the
traditional
marzen
overall
a
great
octoberfest
not
quite
sensational
but
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
come
across
a
fantastic
local
brew
an
excellent
beer
and
although
a
bit
lighter
on
the
body
than
most
others
its
drinkability
is
great
ill
need
a
few
more
bombers
and
may
let
a
few
mellow
in
the
back
of
the
ol
fridge
great
stuff
as
well
made
a
märzen
as
youd
expect
from
the
consistently
thoughtful
and
talented
brewers
at
berkshire
o
an
above
average
oktoberfest
but
definitely
not
a
top
five
candidate
this
beer
is
really
a
grand
slam
for
the
style
germans
be
warned
youve
got
some
stiff
competition
from
america

a
bomber
berkshire
brewing
co
oktoberfest
while
not
the
most
traditional
example
of
the
style
is
just
a
lot
more
bold
than
other
oktoberfest
beers
it
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
and
i
plan
on
enjoying
this
all
season
o
a
very
well
done
oktoberfest
props
to
bbc
for
making
some
really
solid
brews
this
is
a
solid
local
oktoberfest
berkshire
consistently
puts
out
quality
beers
and
the
price
point
makes
it
even
better
keep
up
the
fine
work
overall
not
bad
this
is
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
remember
almost
cloyingly
sweet
a
nice
malt
presence
but
no
hops
either
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
this
batch
is
much
worse
than
i
remember
their
oktoberfest
being
i
hope
its
just
this
batch
dvery
sweet
and
tasty
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
was
certainly
an
incredibly
enjoyable
experience
but
it
would
certainly
be
difficult
to
drink
more
than
two
or
three
that
is
without
feeling
like
you
ate
six
slices
of
pumpkin
pie
or
any
other
typical
fall
pastry
ive
been
just
about
worn
out
from
octoberfest
beers
at
this
point
but
well
give
it
a
lackluster
whirl
appearance
is
nice
and
clean
with
about
as
much
head
as
expected
on
the
initial
pour
it
smells
nice
and
sweet
and
if
i
hadnt
been
so
worn
out
on
the
style
id
be
attracted
to
it
i
guess
what
it
really
has
going
for
it
is
the
orange
label
that
screams
october
and
the
stereotypical
flavors
i
assosciate
with
it
yum
but
im
ready
for
spiced
winter
beers
i
know
this
review
blows
but
it
is
what
it
is
drinkability
this
to
me
is
an
average
octoberfest
in
every
sense
i
like
the
maltiness
but
am
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
i
like
several
of
berkshires
offerings
a
lot
better
there
is
a
good
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
light
and
feels
like
a
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
not
as
complex
at
it
actually
is
a
bold
and
different
american
oktoberfest
doesnt
rely
on
sweetness
to
make
it
enjoyable
mouthfeel
for
an
oktoberfest
is
pretty
good
the
wet
finish
may
deduct
from
the
body
but
mild
carbonation
and
a
good
body
obviously
easy
drinking
it
is
an
oktoberfest
after
all
drinkability
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
quite
big
in
character
and
alcohol
goes
down
smoothly
although
a
little
thick
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
and
munich
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
nice
malt
profile
that
boasts
of
pilsner
crystal
and
munich
malts
it
has
a
light
sweetness
along
with
a
dry
bready
character
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
dry
malty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
marzen
its
tasty
and
easy
drinking
a
damn
fine
seasonal
drinkability
i
easily
put
down
the
22
oz
bomber
but
could
maybe
only
put
down
a
bottle
and
a
half
the
creaminess
and
boldness
prevent
it
from
being
a
big
old
session
beer
for
me
but
thats
okay
id
rather
savor
the
heartiness
of
this
great
autumn
brew
and
leave
the
few
onpoint
oktoberfest
imports
as
the
session
brews
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
very
minimal
head
biscuity
malty
aroma
along
pumpkin
slightly
sweet
flavor
mixed
with
some
spices
similiar
to
pumpkin
some
grass
type
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
lingering
flavor
hmmm
not
spectacular
really
but
i
guess
drinkable
not
something
i
would
search
out
for
but
also
not
something
i
would
turn
down
either
overall
not
an
octoberfest
i
want
to
much
of
the
skunk
flavors
through
it
off
a
bit
could
be
worse
could
be
better
average
drinkability
db
a
good
example
of
the
style
nice
balance
of
fall
flavors
and
some
fruit
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
damn
good
i
cant
say
i
love
the
style
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
for
cetrain
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
an
fruity
which
i
dont
love
but
its
still
got
a
nice
maltiness
thats
really
satisfying
light
carbonation
very
easy

i

but
its
really
nice
i
was
excited
for
this
one
as
these
guys
make
great
lagers
dmuch
better
than
other
us
oktoberfest
styles
i
have
tried
big
flavors
and
a
nice
medium
body
definitely
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
lagers
out
there
ive
had
i
dont
think
its
quite
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
it
is
a
damn
fine
brew
great
for
the
season
this
an
interesting
brew
a
very
sweet
version
of
this
style
both
the
nose
and
flavor
is
a
sweet
butter
malt
while
some
others
have
not
enjoyed
this
i
found
it
quite
good
its
a
nice
caramel
butter
toffee
flavor
its
a
great
autumn
orage
in
color
witha
bright
white
head
very
easy
to
drink
and
warms
well
on
a
cool
sept
night
d
it
was
tasty
but
something
might
have
gone
wrong
here
update
this
batch
was
recalled
next
time
i
get
a
bottle
ill
have
to
rereview
at
least
the
sink
loved
it
d
really
nice
take
on
a
maerzen
from
an
american
brewery
that
seems
to
really
be
making
a
lot
of
great
beer
fy10
22oz
bomber
wow
this
is
one
beer
you
need
to
seek
out
immediately
ive
been
anticipating
the
release
of
berkshires
ofest
for
months
as
it
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
and
this
years
version
is
over
the
top
a
humongous
taste
of
carmel
toffee
malty
sweet
deliciousness
of
all
the
beers
ive
tasted
this
year
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
top
5
d
this
is
an
excellent
oktoberfest
big
malt
flavors
and
great
creamy
texture
another
great
offering
from
bbc
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
ofests
that
ive
tried
not
there
best
offering
from
bbc
a
bit
off
the
mark
for
a
marzen
style
brew
big
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
nose
had
a
beautiful
sweet
malty
cast
color
was
a
bright
deep
amber
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
perfect
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
wonderfully
oktoberfestlike
this
was
great
and
for
the
price
yow
whether
its
the
alcohol
or
simple
displeasure
i
am
literally
stumbling
to
the
finish
of
this
bomber
i
have
to
admit
i
was
anxious
about
a
doublesized
serving
of
an
oktoberfest
but
it
turns
out
that
this
isnt
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind
even
the
best
breweries
have
occasional
hiccups
and
well
chalk
this
one
up
to
an
off
batch
thanks
mcbrewsalot
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
bringing
this
back
from
vt
a
22
ounce

bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
off
white
foam
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
caramel
malts
sweet
biscuits
prickly
mildly
spicy
hops
a
bit
fruity
some
toffee
more
malt
toasted
bread
amply
carbonated
for
a
marzen
with
a
clean
finish
albeit
a
bit
sweet
but
the
sweetness
is
welcome
here
thanks
again
tim
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
the
sweet
aftertaste
for
me
wouldnt
qualify
this
as
a
session
beer
the
bottle
says
local
and
fresh
but
ill
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
since
i
do
not
see
a
bornon
or
bestby
date
pours
a
nice
copper
this
beer
looks
like
october
nose
and
flavor
is
nothing
but
sweet

abv
is
wellhidden
since
i
would
have
guessed
lower
this
really
is
a
wellcrafted
octoberfest
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
especially
at
the
great
price
for
my
next
fall
drinking
session
i
would
love
to
have
2
or
3
of
these
and
call
it
a
night
mouthfeel
is
really
big
and
coating
i
would
use
smooth
but
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
and
aftertaste
sweetness
that
makes
it
linger
a
bit
too
much
drinkability
is
okay
but
the
abv
is
just
too
high
if
i
were
to
drink
mug
after
mug
of
a
beer
on
a
october
afternoon
i
wouldnt
choose
this
one
cheers
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
nice

pour
but
the
head
didnt
last
or
lace
well
the
aroma
was
fairly
balanced
between
biscuit
roasted
malt
woodiness
vanillanut
and
mild
citrus
however
the
flavor
was
a
little
too
imbalanced
towards
the
citrus
side
while
the
feel
was
a
little
too
thin
for
a
maerzen
an
overall
average
example
of
the
style
clear
coppery

with
a
fine

the

and
a

hazy

was
very
malty

with

is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
imperial

mouthfeel
fell
between

with
a
consistent
background
effervescence
one
of
the
more
drinkable
oktoberfest
beers
in
my
opinion
fairly
decent
complexity
for
the
style
but
a
bit
sweeter
than
one
would
anticipate
i
typically
love
just
about
anything
bbc
puts
out
and
this
one
came
with
high
praise
im
a
little
bit
disappointed
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
easily
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
had
to
grab
this
one
on
my
way
home
from
work
today
the
weather
called
for
it

the

of
if
not
my
favorite

im
just
glad

malty

hoppy
just
like
beers
tend
to
taste
there
some
toasty
accents
and
then
the
spiceherbs
just
roll
over
your
tongue
with
such
a
great
taste
also
with
minimal
hops
presence
i
was
anxious
for
more
but
im
afraid
that
it
will
have
to
await
my
next
trip
to
ma
as
berkshires
products
are
unfortunately
not
distributed
in
my
home
state
of

this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
berkshire
products
and
next
time
ill
purchase
more

not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
st
arnold
could
have
done
a
little
better
on
this
one
it
could
use
a
little
more
on
the
nose
not
a
good
attempt
in
my
opinion
actually
an
oktoberfest
ale
saint
arnold
tried
it
as
an
ale
and
a
lager
and
the
ale
was
much
more
popular
very
tasty
smooth
fruity
medium
bodied
just
enough
hops
and
very
surprinsingly
good
not
bad
light
on
the
color
flavor
taste
but
not
bad
at
all
i
found
it
a
bit
cloying
given
its
sweetness
level
despite
of
the
help
from
its
perceived
hops
i
am
very
disappointed
with
this
one
i
always
anxiously
await
the
release
of
sa
oktoberfest
and
have
only
been
disappointed
once
until
now
this
beer
has
nothing
special
about
it
and
quite
frankly
is
completely
forgettable
i
give
it
a
3
purely
as
a
sign
of
respect
to
sa
because
they
generally
do
everything
right
hey
everybody
can
have
a
bad
day
and
maybe
its
just
my
palate
but
im
disappointed
cant
wait
for
the
2014
christmas
ale
to
come
out
though
love
you
saint
arnold
overall
drinkable
with
a
nice
malty
body
but
a
bit
too
sweet
as
with
some
of
saint
arnolds
other
ale
offerings
overall
so
as
far
as
the
märzen
style
goes
this
features
an
ale
yeast
so
its
a
bit
creamier
than
most
oktoberfest
and
less
of
a
crisp
finish
besides
that
this
is
still
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
in
the
same
price
point
at
sam
adams
oktoberfest
this
has
more
of
a
cloying
finish
than
most
oktoberfests
so
in
my
opinion
this
is
just
begging
to
be
paired
with
a
nice
hearty
fall
meal
makes
me
want
to
smoke
a
brisket
love
this
beer
bought
it
in
late
september
and
after
the
first
six
pack
i
went
out
and
stocked
my
fridge
with
enough
to
last
me
until
late
dec
looks
like
a
golden
amber
autumn
leaf
and
smells
as
bittersweet
as
hooking
up
with
a
hot
girl
and
not
remembering
it
because
you
had
too
much
to
drink
at
oktoberfest
it
really
just
tastes
like
what
beer
should
taste
like
with
perfect
balance
and
is
by
far
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
each
drink
makes
you
want
another
and
against
all
of
the
other
american
oktoberfest
beers
this
one
is
head
and
shoulders
above
a
must
try
this
is
an
ok
brew
it
is
fairly
light
and
the
initial
flavor
dissipates
that
initial
flavor
has
some
good
notes
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
slight
head
no
real
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
nose
is
sweet
malt
grains
molasses
with
a
woody
character
sweet
and
pungent
overall
this
is
pretty
good
quaff
this
was
blah
for
me
c
this
is
my
second
favorite
beer
from
st
arnolds
brewery
only
behind
the
glorious
pumpkinator
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
orange
with
a
golden
orange
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
flavor
upfront
is
a
great
carmel
sweetness
with
hints
of
hop
in
the
back
end
the
smell
is
really
the
only
disappointing
part
of
this
beer
there
really
is
none
its
so
weak
in
the
smell
department
that
its
a
huge
disappointment
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
small
oily
feeling
on
the
back
body
is
medium
and
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
pretty
much
what
you
expect
when
you
get
an
octoberfest
even
if
not
particularly
outstanding
oktoberfest
in
augustthese
seasonal
beers
keep
releasing
earlier
and
earlier
soon
we
will
be
drinking
christmas
ale
in
september
but
anyways
this
is
a
good
beer
no
matter
the
season
st
arnolds
oktoberfest
imo
is
the
best
of
the
stylebetter
than
sam
adams
and
others
that
i
have
had
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
thats
the
style
i
guess
drinks
well
and
good
abv
this
is
my
halloween
beer
when
trick
or
treating
with
my
kids
good
seasonal
beer
from
st
arnold
and
true
to
their
other
seasonal
offerings
better
than
their
year
round
beers
you
can
read
all
the
other
professional
reviews
on
this
page
but
from
a
strictly
pedestrian
beer
drinking
perspective
i
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
malt
forward
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
that
would
rock
in
concert
with
some
wings
or
other
tail
gating
fare
its
an
easy
drinker
and
should
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
given
the
above
average
abv
of
6
dont
mess
with
texas
beers
or
the
texans
salud
pours
a

there

long
lasting

of
sourdough
and
hint
of
grassy
hops
body
is
medium
and
smooth
caramel
malt
and
herbal

are
balanced
on
the

is

of

rjt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
biege
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
are
some
tiny
streaming
bubbles
visible
in
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
bread
with
some
herbal
and
earthy
notes
from
the
hops
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
you
definitely
get
the
full
flavor
of
munich
malts
here
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
i
pick
up
those
earthy
and
herbal
hop
flavors
but
like
these
are
mild
and
allow
the
malt
profile
to
come
through
more
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
crisp
and
smooth
permitting
high
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
bit
sweet
but
didnt
overpower
just
a
good
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
these
again
and
again
enjoyed
o
entire
profile
is
out
of
whack
per
style
too
sweet
and
not
light
nor
clean
enough
i
wasnt
a
fan
but
my
girlfriend
liked
it
so
this
became
her
beer
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
you
dont
even
taste
the
6
abv
it
has
a
certain
crispness
to
it
but
it
still
has
a
wet
finish
i
like
the
aftertaste
that
it
leaves
i
could
easily
see
myself
making
a
session
out
of
these
easy
to
put
down
im
starting
to
regret
saying
something
to
the
effect
of
ive
never
tasted
an
oktoberfest
beer
i
didnt
like
this
case
in
point
pours
a
clear
toasty
brown
color
good
head
retention
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
at
draught
temperatures
light
in
taste
with
a
bitter
hop
kick
at
the
end
its
not
the
smooth
lightly
malted
marzen
ive
come
to
know
and
love
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
but
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
a
sixer
at
home
received
this
in
a
trade
with
ladyofmuchbeer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
transparent
amber
hue
with
virtually
zero
head
the
nose
is
pretty
muted
not
a
lot
going
on
at
most
you
pick
up
what
seems
to
be
some
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
maybe
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
definitely
on
the
malty
side
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
alkaline
like
there
isnt
a
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
nice
this
goes
down
real
clean
overall
while
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
session
beer
this
time
of
year
on
a
cool
cloudy
day
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
get
mad
if
i
was
stuck
drinking
it
either
overall
very
good
to
style
o
my
first
oktoberfestoct
1
d
and
i
enjoyed
it
was
refreshing
d
quite
drinkable
and
reasonably
good
oktoberfest
not
overly
sweet
but
lacking
a
bit
of
intensity
o
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
find
it
too
syrupy
sweet
with
some
ho
hum
flavors
crushed
it
easily
but
it
lost
my
attention
rather
quicklly
very
hoppy
for
an
oktoberfest
give
it
a
try
this
pours
a
light
amberish
color
with
a
nice
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
of
bready
and
caramel
malts
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
more
of
the
caramel
and
bready
malts
a
little
lighter
than
some
of
the
others
overall
a
good
beer
although
one
of
the
weaker
oktoberfests
ive
tried
recently
o
very
impressed
with
this
oktoberfest
so
far
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brews
out
it
is
very
well
rounded
pleasant
taste
and
overall
feel
each
sip
is
delightful
and
refreshing
i
definitely
recommend
everyone
to
try
it
o
if
i
had
to
choose
a
texasmade
oktoberfest
id
opt
for
rahr
or
even
shiner
over
this
one
solid
choice
and
worth
trying
though
o
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
score
a
single
a
six
pack
would
take
a
while
to
finish
o
a
pretty
tasty
take
on
the
style
has
a
different
taste
to
it
because
it
is
an
ale
but
i
really
like
the
end
product
overallpretty
simple
but
what
i
expected
i
will
probably
drink
this
6
pack
by
the
end
of
the
day
d
decent
brew
lighter
than
most
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
good
brew
that
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
would
like
to
have
again
and
i
recommend
trying
it
drinkability
the
winner
of
the
group
ive
had
from
this
brewery
im
very
impressed
with
saint
arnold
on
this
one
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
at
all
drinkability
im
having
this
one
a
bit
late
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
think
im
ever
in
the
mood
for
more
than
one
oktoberfest
in
an
evening
but
this
was
an
easy
beer
to
sip
on
a
bit
stronger
than
brooklyn
ales
version
so
drinkability
might
not
be
quite
as
good
but
this
is
still
very
good
beer
especially
paired
with
traditional
german
food
as
i
just
had
it
little
wonder
many
in
tx
are
switching
to
this
from
shiner
which
is
good
but
well
to
each
our
own
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
quickly
fleeting
rocky
off
white
head
smells
of
caramel
bread
honey
graham
cracker
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
caramel
honey
candied
dark
fruit
and
just
enough
hops
to
keep
this
from
being
sweet
crisp
level
of
carbonation
syrupycreamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
great
ofest
from
texas
very
well
done
a
good
robust
oktoberfest
d
tasty
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
autumn
particularly
here
in
houston
where
the
temperatures
are
still
hovering
around
the
mid80s
try
it
if
you
have
access
to
it
a
good
beer
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
mild
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
tastes
fine
not
worth
buying
a
bunch
of
but
worth
a
taste
if
you
like
octoberfests
this
was
a
fairly
average
oktoberfest
beer
easily
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
the
fall
climate
at
colder
temps
40
or
so
it
is
not
that
great
i
let
it
warm
up
and
it
got
much
better
there
is
really
not
much
to
say
other
than
its
a
typical
tasting
american
style
oktoberfest
beer
decent
level
of
sweet
maltiness
and
dry
hopped
it
was
kind
of
overly
carbonated
for
my
taste
i
thought
it
was
better
than
sam
adams
this
beer
didnt
really
invoke
much
it
didnt
give
me
much
to
elaborate
on
whats
to
say
it
was
decent
i
would
have
another
if
the
price
was
reasonable
it
was
a
good
autumn
beer
an
ok
effort
but
nothing
about
which
to
get
excited
d
enjoyable
but
it
is
better
ontap
or
directly
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
toffee
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
notes
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
grape
as
well
as
a
slight
bit
of
hop
bitterness
to
help
balance
the
flavor
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
trade
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
orange
with
a
nice
lasting
off
white
head
that
eventually
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
malts
the
beer
is
strangely
thick
like
unhardened
gelatin
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
likely
one
i
would
have
again
drinkability
overall
with
the
weird
aftertaste
i
was
getting
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
much
more
than
one
will
try
on
tap
to
compare
to
bottle
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
ive
had
this
year
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
6er
of
this
stuff
straight
but
it
was
pretty
awesome
dark
golden
color
excellent
head
smooth
mouthfeel
and
great
flavor
rich
earthy
hoppy
aroma
with
hoppy
and
earthy
flavors
but
balanced
with
a
great
spiced
malt
flavor
balanced
is
the
key
phrase
here
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
pack
to
split
with
friends
not
quite
to
style
but
good
except
for
slightly
odd
aroma
thanks
ericandersnavy
for
the
oppportunity
a
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
brew
drinks
very
well
with
higher
end
of
abv
for
style
covered
well
it
does
have
an
ale
character
to
it
and
says
ale
though
in
texas
it
goes
by
abv
level
im
assuming
its
an
ale
version
of
the
style
and
for
that
it
does
well
bringing
in
malty
smoothness
that
is
not
overly
sweet
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
when
in
a
maltaccented
beer
mood
decent
enough
beer
not
really
representative
of
the
style
but
im
not
hung
up
on
that
i
just
suspect
some
of
these
tastes
diacetyl
might
not
be
what
the
brewer
originally
intended
gimme
the
lawnmower
any
day
thanks
exiled
if
it
was
still
available
i
would
buy
it
again
only
if
my
favorites
were
out
pretty
nice
i
probably
wont
buy
again
because
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
still
really
not
bad
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
so
glad
i
tried
the
bottled
version
of
this
it
was
definitely
worth
the
second
chance
final
thoughts
it
started
pretty
good
great
appearance
and
nose
to
start
then
the
taste
was
a
little
interesting
with
some
roasted
porter
tastes
and
slight
chocolate
malt
and
some
toasty
tastes
then
it
went
downhill
with
some
strange
sweet
syrupy
tastes
diacetyl
and
other
weird
flavors
about
halfway
through
the
beer
and
all
the
initial
strange
flavors
blend
into
the
taste
buds
its
starting
to
slightly
taste
more
like
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
not
really
i
give
them
some
credit
for
stepping
outside
the
bounds
but
perhaps
not
on
an
oktoberfest
call
it
harvest
or
autumn
or
something
verdict
a
solid
märzen
saint
arnolds
oktoberfest
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
taste
of
fall
something
to
look
forward
to
each
year
like
most
of
this
brewerys
seasonal
releases
the
mouth
is
crisp
but
a
trifle
thin
for
the
style
still
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
take
on
the
lighter
modern
ofest
flavor
is
also
on
the
subdued
side
with
some
sweet
cola
orange
apricot
and
toffee
notes
that
remind
me
of
an
old
ale
actually
still
less
sweet
and
bready
than
other
oktoberfests
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
havent
noticed
in
others
after
sipping
for
a
while
i
think
the
light
hops
actually
make
this
a
pretty
balanced
beer
and
im
liking
the
effect
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
finishes
cleanly
thanks
to
that
bitter
property
on
the
whole
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
different
than
i
expected
not
really
a
fan
havent
had
many
oktoberfests
though
opinion
well
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
good
bit
from
what
i
would
expect
from
an
octoberfest
the
balance
is
considerably
sweeter
than
other
german
versions
which
balance
toward
the
dry
slightly
maybe
the
yeast
slighlty
underattenuated
but
i
seriously
think
that
it
was
just
the
grainbill
there
is
likely
tworow
and
crystal
malts
maybe
caramunich
to
make
up
for
the
lightness
of
the
base
malts
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
using
almost
entirely
munich
malt
for
the
grain
bill
but
that
is
personal
preference
i
will
probably
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wont
be
expecting
the
exact
style
that
is
printed
on
the
bottle
it
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
regardless
of
the
intended
style
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
amazing
but
it
was
solid
i
will
gladly
keep
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
all
fall
very
fresh
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy

that
dies
to
a

rather
quickly
smells
strongly
of
caramel

with
a
bit
of
wet
hay
in
the
background
sweet
and
bready
taste
again
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
some
very
light
grassy
hops
medium
body
not
a
bad
ofest
d
fairly
high
depending
on
the
pairing
alone
maybe
not
so
much
but
with
a
hearty
meal
this
would
be
mighty
nice

have
ever
had
right

i
like
this
one
easy

make
the
evenings
go
well
d
although
its
a
bit
past
oktoberfest
my
mom
bought
this
for
me
when
it
came
out
and
now
im
visiting
home
for
thanksgiving
i
quite
like
this
a
very
drinkable
märzen
with
a
nice

to
it
would
definitely
buy
again
next
year
dnothing
spectacular
but
it
all
comes
together
to
form
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
brew
a
very
nice
effort
by
st

that
i
would
be
happy

overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer

there
are

many
better
oktoberfests
out
there
this
beer
does
not
meet
oktoberfest

marzen
standards

almost
had
no

the
taste
was
pretty
boring

it
was
a

this

cheers
to

the

decent
take
on
an
oktoberfest
here
it
could
have
used
a

more

and
the

was

thin

it
still
drank

all
around
will
gladly
drink
more
if
i
had
it
available
a
fine
octoberfest
amazed
at
how
this
beer
is
very
malty
but
yet
avoids
being
overly
sweet
or
sticky
quite
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
recommended
oktoberfest
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
excellent
feel
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
oktoberfest
like
many
american
ofests
this
one
leaves
toward
a
richer
roasted
caramel
flavor
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
just
different
the
aroma
in
addition
to
the
toffee
and
caramel
has
a
slight
hardwater
mineral
note
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
also
finishes
with
a
mild
black
pepper
note
worth
a
stein
full
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
the
maltiness
became
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
again
this
is
something
that
i
liked
in
this
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
good
beer
from
saint
arnold
if
the
sweetness
was
a
little
less
this
would
be
a
great
beer
still
something
i
would
recommend

this
beer
is
mellow
and
a
nice
end
of
summer
drink
i
am
currently
enjoying
this
while
homebrewing
a
stout
on
a
cooler
summer
night
it
makes
me
look
forward
to
the
winter
months
excellent
beer
d
drink
one
and
than
another
and
another
and
another
and
another
drinkability
very
drinkable
because
it
does
not
wreck
the
pallet
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
but
it
will
not
become
my
goto
beer
while
available
d
definitely
drinkable
as
the
somewhat
high
abv
is
not
apparent
at
all
this
is
a
very
smooth
brew
that
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
after
storing
it
for
a
year
it
was
undrinkable
cloudy
amber
pour
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
tastes
was
a
light
bodied
maltiness
with
some
almost
tartness
as
well
perhaps
biscuity
malt
flavored
somewhat
of
a
quick
light
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
prefered
styles
either
edit
i
think
i
did
get
a
bad
sample
or
maybe
this
years
sample
is
just
super
fresh
and
awesome
or
maybe
this
is
just
a
better
version
i
bought
a
sixer
for
extras
in
a
trade
i
just
cracked
it
open
not
bad
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
there
is
a
little
bit
of
dry
tannins
and
a
touch
of
off
flavor
on
the
mouth
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
full
crisp
oktoberfest
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
good
smooth
with
maybe
a
slighty
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
session
candidate
i
finally
found
my
notes
from
fredericksburg
texas
oktoberfest
this
poured
up
amber
with
a
light
tan
creamy
head
smells
of
caramel
malts
sweet
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
roasted
caramel
flavor
almost
like
maple
syrup
with
hops
at
the
finish
it
had
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
it
left
a
ring
of
sugar
feeling
on
my
lips
this
beer
goes
right
on
par
with
all
of
the
other
oktoberfests
i
have
had
this
beer
is
a
very
good
beer
and
being
from
a
texas
brewery
i
tend
to
lean
that
way
when
hitting
the
local
liquor
store
for
a
quick
sixer
but
compared
to
all
of
the
octoberfests
not
brewed
in
germany
this
one
is
tops
in
my
book
definatly
a
good
malty
flavor
and
light
mouthfeel
to
bad
this
one
is
only
out
for
a
short
time
somewhat
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retains
well
smell
is
lightly
fruity
with
some
breadiness
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
little
dms
present
again
taste
has
some
fruitiness
and
plenty
of
bread
but
the
dms
or
something
similar
detracts
from
the
brew
for
me
taste
would
be
much
higher
if
not
for
that
above
medium
levels
of
carbonation
and
slightly
heavier
than
medium
bodied
im
thinking
they
could
make
this
oktoberfest
a
real
winner
with
a
couple
changes
in
procedures
but
who
am
i
to
judge
decent
brew
from
what
seems
to
be
a
pretty
darn
good
brewer
drinkablity
though
the
mouth
got
a
low
score
this
is
still
very
drinkable
mild
and
smooth
with
a
good
sweet
flavor
helps
this
go
down
easy
and
at
6
abv
you
can
have
a
few
without
thinking
the
last
of
my
american
oktoberfest
beer
reviews
next
week
i
will
be
at
the
real
deal
and
see
how
these
young
pups
stand
up
again
it
looks
identical
to
other
american
marzens
dark
amber
and
clear
with
a
nice
white
head
i
like
the
smell
on
this
a
bit
more
it
has
more
force
to
it
i
get
a
nutty
malty
flavor
to
it
kudos
to
st
arnold
for
changing
it
up
a
bit
i
dont
love
hate
love
it
but
an
a
for
effort
see
you
all
in
munchin
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
and
im
sure
youll
be
impressed
with
this
houston
brewery
i
know
i
am
thanks
ttu94
and
remember
the
thickah
the
waistband
the
deepah
the
quicksand
or
so
i
have
heard
i
like
it
but
its
not
a
great
example
of
an
oktoberfest
lager
in
my
opinion
would
make
a
very
nice
amber
ale
though
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
copper
color
with
tons
of
carb
it
had
a
very
small
head
that
quickly
disappeared
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
pleasing
with
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
good
as
well
its
a
little
sweeter
than
other
oktoberfests
that
ive
had
lately
but
not
too
much
this
is
not
one
of
favorite
styles
but
i
do
go
thru
a
short
stretch
where
i
like
to
try
em
this
one
is
a
keeper
and
can
see
drinking
a
sixer
or
so
every
year
overall
a
good
beer
and
recommend
trying
3
5
rboay
t
o
not
your
true
oktoberfest
but
a
beer
worthy
of
the
season
that
is
highly
sessionable
and
very
good
d
notes
the
thing
is
this
beer
actually
tastes
good
however
if
it
didnt
say
octoberfest
on
the
label
i
might
not
even
think
i
probably
wouldnt
guess
i
am
drinking
an
ofest
beer
saint
arnold
admits
they
are
using
ale
yeast
to
brew
this
beer
and
while
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
that
it
simply
isnt
true
to
the
style
there
are
way
too
may
estercy
flavors
in
this
beer
and
according
to
any
brewing
book
those
are
off
limits
in
a
ofest
still
an
interesting
effort
and
a
decently
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
forming
a
1
inch
light
tan
head
that
quickly
fadeds
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
good
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
nutty
from
the
sweet
malt
but
just
with
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
finish
about
medium
mouthfeel
the
full
smooth
flavor
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
ale
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
this
is
the
first
oktoberfest
beer
that
actually
stands
out
in
my
mind
as
being
above
average
a
great
offering
from
saint
arnold
and
one
that
i
will
be
taking
advantage
of
while
its
available
d
good
all
around
beer
certainly
reminds
me
of
the
fall
with
its
malty
notes
and
sweetness
while
this
isnt
a
german
marzen
and
certainly
no
paulaner
i
guess
it
would
be
a
texas
take
on
a
german
tradition
this
beer
is
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
and
i
shall
enjoy
it
any
chance
i
get
if
anything
it
is
too
sweet
but
not
bad
pours
out
a
chillhazed
orangeamber
with
lots
of
bubbles
feeding
a
thinnish
head
smell
is
overwhelmingly
toasty
without
the
typical
rich
malty
aroma
of
an
oktoberfest
i
pick
up
a
good
bit
of
booze
as
well
tastes
medicinal
overly
toasty
oddly
fruity
oddly
somewhat
roasty
and
has
a
saccharinelike
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
and
prickly
with
bubbles
not
for
me
if
it
didnt
have
the
word
oktoberfest
on
the
label
i
surely
wouldnt
think
of
this
as
an
oktoberfest
overall
impression
not
bad
a
rather
average
oktoberfest
d
very
nice
on
par
with
some
german
imported
ofests
i
would
buy
and
drink
this
if
it
were
available
near
me
pours
transparent
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
malty
sweetness
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
faint
hop
aroma
some
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
makes
a
decent
session
beer
and
tastes
ok
compared
to
others
in
the
style
id
have
to
say
i
prefer
paulaners
or
spatens
over
this
but
this
is
good
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
i
feel
i
have
had
better
its
maybe
okay
in
a
pinch
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
lovely
color
to
this
one
it
was
coppery
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
was
nice
and
the
taste
had
an
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
it
was
not
too
alchoholic
tasting
and
it
was
very
true
to
its
style
it
was
drinkable
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
it
was
not
a
revelation
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
executed
well
1andahalf
12oz
bottles
in
a
halfliter
ayinger
glass
pours
a
pretty
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
but
lasting
head
sweet
malt
aroma
rather
caramellike
instead
of
toasty
or
bready
flavor
reflects
aroma
well
sweet
malt
cut
by
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
smooth
clean
finish
neutral
texture
body
on
the
high
side
of
moderate
d
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
interpretation
by
saint
arnold
some
have
said
it
is
too
onedimensional
but
i
didnt
see
it
sweeter
than
other
marzens
but
different
can
be
good
this
is
a
unique
rendition
of
the
oktober
style
its
a
solid
delicious
fall
treat
and
one
with
few
flaws
another
decent
offering
from
saint
arnolds
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
pale
coppery
color
low
aromasome
buttery
sweet
malt
aroma
malty
upfront
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
rather
thin
bodycould
sure
use
a
kick
to
liven
it
up
a
tad
ok
beer
overall
take
a
chancemake
your
own
opinion
im
not
overly
impressed
thanks
to
mushroomcloud
for
the
bottle
a
sweet
malt
presence
is
here
but
the
turnoff
is
the
signature
saint
arnolds
dirty
malt
finish
id
enjoy
a
few
of
these
if
the
opportunity
arose
a
nice
beer
for
the
day
ahead
very
drinkable
a
solid
ofest
well
made
and
worth
a
try
another
quality
offering
from
sa
just
picked
up
this
6
pack
yesterday
so
this
should
be
this
seasons
oktoberfest
batch
as
with
many
of
st
arnolds
beers
this
one
pours
with
very
little
carbonation
no
head
very
nice
amber
hue
would
look
prettier
with
some
fizz
good
smell
spicy
and
hoppy
on
second
whiff
i
note
light
smell
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
definite
taste
but
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
hint
of
lemon
caramel
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
molasses
and
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
not
the
best
brew
st
arnold
produces
but
decent
tastes
like
a
very
malty
elissa
ipa
beer
is
good
happy
beering
thanks
to
kindestcut
for
this
one
this
beer
is
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
eggshell
white
head
thin
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
mediumbodied
with
a
kind
of
fuzzy
mouthfeel
very
very
sweet
flavor
of
malt
and
little
else
aside
from
a
bit
of
caramel
very
onedimensional
which
is
saying
something
for
a
marzen
the
finish
is
sweet
and
bready
not
terrible
but
definitely
too
onesided
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
14
beige
head
over
the
orangey
copper
brew
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
and
lacing
minimal
at
best
with
just
little
bubbles
left
here
and
there
that
eventually
fall
to
the
liquid
aroma
is
malty
with
a
slight
hops
component
taste
is
sweetly
malty
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
in
there
with
the
slightest
hops
presence
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
not
a
bad
octoberfest
for
sure
the
is
an
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
better
local
beers
that
i
have
had
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
impression
my
review
doesnt
do
it
justice
im
enjoying
the
season
already
i
can
pound
these
or
savor
them
depending
on
mood
not
quite
the
expected
taste
for
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
one
of
the
milder
examples
of
the
style
this
is
the
first
nongerman
interpretation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
that
ive
sampled
saint
arnold
oktoberfest
pours
a
very
good
medium
amber
but
unfortunately
follows
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
good
and
malty
aroma
is
biscuity
with
a
little
something
else
i
cant
quite
place
taste
is
solidly
malty
but
finishes
a
little
too
sweet
honey
taste
is
noted
in
the
finish
fortunately
the
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
this
is
a
solid
and
likable
brew
but
i
prefer
the
few
german
examples
ive
tried
so
far
this
bottleconditioned
oktoberfest
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
body
with
gold
and
orange
highlights
beneath
a
full
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
its
head
retention
is
good
and
it
slowly
drops
to
a
wide
creamy
collar
and
cottony
surface
covering
sticky
splashes
of
lace
left
about
the
glass
add
to
its
appearance
some
delicate
tart
fruit
in
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
plums
and
dried
apricot
and
theyre
carried
over
into
the
flavor
wrapped
in
sweet
lightly
doughy
and
just
slightly
toasted
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
restrained
allowing
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
to
dominate
the
flavor
profile
without
becoming
cloying
and
a
swash
of
spicy
hops
comes
through
clearly
also
helping
to
dry
things
out
a
mediumlight
body
and
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
also
helps
to
keep
its
yeasty
fruit
and
malty
sweetness
in
check
and
it
finishes
semidry
with
some
lingering
maltiness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
its
certainly
not
a
traditional
germanstyle
oktoberfestmarzen
but
more
of
a
munichmalt
based
belgianstyle
beer
interesting
satisfying
and
refreshing
this
would
certainly
make
a
good
table
beer
at
a
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
welldone
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
tint
of
orange
and
a
short
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
twang
not
an
offputting
type
of
sour
but
rather
something
that
invites
you
to
continue
sniffing
with
some
additional
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
grains
moderate
in
body
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
sweet
malt
tart
fruit
and
bitter
hops
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
saint
arnold
line
of
beers
perfect
to
pair
with
some
grilled
bratwurst
when
i
drink
this
beer
like
a
good
marzen
it
heralds
the
changing
season
by
bringing
something
new
to
your
glass
this
is
a
sweet
beer
however
the
sweetness
is
definitely
balanced
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
distant
fruity
flavor
while
tasty
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
doesnt
feel
heavy
to
me
a
small
grayishcream
head
dies
fast
over
the
clear
dark
redamber
beer
sweet
dark
caramel
in
the
grapesy
nose
the
beer
starts
off
like
a
sugary
grape
drink
dark
cooked
caramel
malt
shows
up
giving
way
to
a
dry
grainsy
bitter
grape
drink
finish
the
aftertaste
is
like
a
sweet
grape
ice
cream
interesting
its
very
grapedrinky
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
all
that
special
either
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twist
off
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
i
bought
this
a
few
weeks
into
november
when
the
store
was
trying
to
move
oktoberfest
inventory
to
make
way
for
winter
brews
i
was
not
a
fan
wouldnt
recommend
it
there
are
better
oktoberfests
out
there
overall
this
is
a
decent
american
version
of
an
oktoberfeststyle
beer
very
tasty
and
very
refreshing
solid
beer
its
really
sweet
without
balance

hits
all
the
right
notes
and
some
that
go
beyond
the
call
of
duty
even
i
still
wish
it
was
a
lager
though
looks
aside
this
is
a
mediocre
festbier
more
sweet
than
toasty
and
more
sugary
than
nutty
some
grassy
hops
at
the
end
help
cut
the
sweetness
had
an
ofest
itch
this
diminished
it
but
did
not
quite
satisfy
it
o
a
solid
slightly
americanized
octoberfest
overall
a
solid
good
tasting
oktoberfestbier
very
good
malt
flavors
and
not
too
sweet
good
hosp
and
nice
mouthfeel
would
like
to
have
a
steinfull
got
a
16
barrel
of
this
maybe
because
i
just
finished
a
yards
ppa
but
this
batch
was
awful
smell
and
taste
were
d
think
pumpkin
i
like
flying
fish
local
lots
of
options
but
this
was
not
the
cats
meow
it
came
from
the
other
end
brooklyn
long
trail
and
yards
are
my
go
to
after
this
now
i
have
a
week
of
this
if
it
improves
and
i
grow
to
like
it
i
will
revise
review
the
man
cave
needs
top
notch
brew
and
this
does
not
not
make
the
grade
ps
i
have
had
more
than
30
brews
pass
thru
my
tap
update
after
almost
a
week
of
this
fish
i
have
gotten
a
little
more
used
to
the
taste
still
would
give
a

pricy
but
worth
it
poured
into
a
mug
pale
color
for
a
marzen
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
was
pleasently
surprising
given
the
color
with
spice
and
cinnamon
notes
the
taste
was
unusual
dank
earthy
and
not
typical
marzen
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
best
feature
rich
soft
and
pleasing
this
is
not
representative
of
the
style
but
a
nice
drinkable
brew
nonetheless
for
transparency
i
had
a
paulaner
oktoberfest
right
before
this
which
is
tough
competition
in
this
category
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
subpar
brew
but
this
one
came
out
nicely
it
mentions
ale
instead
of
lager
so
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
was
going
to
come
out
but
i
really
like
this
light
bodied
hot
cinnamon
and
spicy
kick
it
has
great
take
on
a
style
and
mixing
it
up
poured
in
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
tan
head
which
laced
well
for
a
moment
then
all
disipated
almost
made
me
think
my
glass
was
dirty
was
a
clear
copper
honey
color
and
had
a
nice
malty
bread
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
tasted
of
malt
and
caramel
with
hints
of
grain
and
grass
nice
mild
body
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
styles
for
me
to
drink
and
this
one
is
no
exception
good
beer
overall
pretty
standard
beer
worth
a
try
o
an
excellent
nj
made
representation
of
the
style
spot
on
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
malty
taste
is
light
carbonated
some
malts
a
bit
mild
for
the
style
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
nothing
offensive
there
are
far
better
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
d
regardless
of
what
is
listed
on
the
label
this
is
a
pretty
solid
oktoberfest
worth
picking
up
if
given
the
chance
6abv
per
bottle
label
i
really
like
this
one
just
as
much
as
samuel
adams
octoberfest
it
has
that
same
delicious
octoberfest
taste
it
has
a
great
creamy
texture
to
it
and
is
a
full
bodied
octoberfest
also
some
candy
sweet
toffee
evolves
from
the
malts
pretty
complex
malts
on
this
one
right
up
there
with
the
best
in
my
opinion
and
should
be
mentioned
a
lot
more
often
around
this
time
of
year
underrated
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
oktoberfish
shows
light
amber
color
with
no
head
retention
or
lacing
some
toasted
malt
aromas
offset
by
hints
of
yeast
a
light
mouth
feel
and
lively
carbonation
precede
toasty
malt
flavors
and
a
medium
length
finish
this
is
a
little
lighter
on
its
feet
and
not
as
heavy
as
some
other
u
s
craft
oktoberfest
beers
12
oz

ill
buy
again
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
light
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
sweet
malt
aroma
to
it
with
a
light
autumn
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
decent
for
a
marzen
its
still
too
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
was
light
could
have
been
a
little
heavier
and
more
warming
overall
its
an
average
brew
i
think
nothing
id
need
to
have
again
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
one
again
just
to
be
fair
could
be
dirty
lines
or
the
end
of
the
keg
o
overall
not
bad
at
all
the
spiciness
gives
it
a
slightly
different
dimension
than
many
marzens
solid
but
fails
to
separate
itself
from
the
pack
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
i
have
had
this
year
great
balance
good
use
of
hops
and
nice
clean
finish
i
suggest
trying
the
brooklyn
oktoberfest
over
this
one
overall
i
was
not
really
impressed
by
this
beer
id
classify
this
as
an
oktoberfest
light
o
solid
oktoberfest
not
the
greatest
looking
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
liked
this
better
than
the
dominion
pours
a
hazy
apple
juice
color
with
a
12
inch
foamy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bready
malt
caramel
and
some
light
citrus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
bready
malt
flavor
with
some
caramel
grass
and
citrus
as
well
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
that
i
picked
up
on
a
whim
nothing
too
great
but
definitely
drinkable
overall
a
very
flavorful
brew
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
fairly
interesting
in
taste
o
a
really
good
festbier
and
its
nice
to
see
another
east
coast
version
of
this
style
in
ca
they
seem
to
do
it
well
it
has
a
freshness
thats
hard
to
find
with
a
version
from
across
the
pond
d
awesome
drinkability
its
not
light
but
its
refreshing
and
quite
quenching
the
lower
alcohol
is
on
the
upperend
of
the
sessionable
range
which
i
like
lighter
but
coating
just
enough
carbonation
to
be
above
lacking
drinks
fine
but
a
little
sweet
pours
light
copper
with
very
little
head
faint
malt
smell
but
frankly
there
is
not
much
of
a
smell
to
this
beer
at
all
some
toasty
malt
taste
here
but
not
enough
malt
to
be
true
to
style
mild
but
pleasant
bite
in
the
finish
that
really
gives
this
beer
a
bit
of
character
nice
but
nothing
special
here
o
the
beer
isnt
overly
difficult
to
drink
but
it
lacks
the
thicker
body
and
stronger
flavors
associated
with
the
style
o
im
not
a
fan
of
oktoberfests
but
this
beer
seems
subpar
tastes
like
nothing
smells
like
nothing
its
just
a
nothing
beer
id
drink
it
to
get
drunk
and
thats
all
overall
nice
beer
but
just
not
an
oustanding
version
of
an
octoberfest
overall
a
decent
beer
hoppy
taste
but
easy
enough
to
go
with
lunch
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
in
mass
amounts
but
decent
enough
to
try
one
or
two
and
dall
it
a
day
overall
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
local
pub
had
it
on
tap
overall
though
it
did
not
lead
up
to
my
expectations
it
just
felt
something
was
missing
in
the
ingrediants
i
am
pleased
to
have
least
tried
it
o
nice
wellbalanced
smooooth
brew
this
is
something
i
could
drink
all
day
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
malts
on
the
nose
and
some
caramel
sugars
hearty
bread
in
the
taste
some
nuts
with
sweet
malts
and
chewy
caramel
pleasantly
hopped
in
the
background
medium
body
nice
and
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
almost
no
head
at
all
light
earthy
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
malts
but
nothing
remarkable
about
the
taste
very
very
faint
hops
linger
in
the
finish
medium
body
slick
texture
average
beer
nothing
special
here
overall
not
really
that
great
of
an
example
of
the

not
a

beer

my

brown
somewhat
spicy
aroma

flavor
toasty
bready

some
chocolate
kind
of

very
mellow

i
suppose
nice
mild

bitterness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
here
i
can
imagine
that
with
more
time
given
to
the
beers
conditioning
the
flavors
and
nuances
of
what
each
malt
has
to
offer
would
be
allowed
to
come
to
the
fore
improving
what
is
more
or
less
a
wort
bomb
d
pretty
good
average
oktoberfest
beer
from
flying
fish
not
bad
overall
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
it
overall
its
much
more
enjoyable
than
many
octoberfests
its
a
bit
watery
but
this
style
usually
produces
beers
that
are
watery
and
this
isnt
as
watery
the
lager
quality
is
tempered
by
the
fruit
and
the
heavy
malt
making
it
stand
out
a
bit
as
more
complex
beer

something
id
buy
and
be
comfortable
drinking
for
an
entire
oktoberfest

goes
down

not

filling

good
representation

this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
of
a
long
time
if
youre
the
mood
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
nothing
redeeming
about
this
beer
at
all
still
purchased
in
a
very
reputable
shop
and
lack
of
date
makes
me
wonder
if
it
is
old
or
not
not
recommended
this
was
going
to
be
a
drain
pour
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
in
the
glass
i
prefer
this
one
out
of
a
keg
then
a
bottle
i
got
this
with
a
microbrew
pack
in
the
manahawkin
new

unlimited
this
beer
pours
a
brown
colour
with
halffinger
white

with
some

the

is
fruity
with
a

of

a
subtle

taste
with

mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
its
a
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
especially
with
fall
seasonal
food
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
that
it
goes
down
easily
is
quite
satisfying
to
drink
and
im
always
ready
for
another
sip
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
in
an
evening
im
also
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
this
beer
goes
with
the
various
cheeses
on
this
mixed
cheese
plate
which
i
started
nibbling
on
about
halfway
through
the
beer
pours
a
copper

is
of

with
a
dank
lagerlike

is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
slightly
over
carbonated
average
octoberfest
just
a
sweetened
lager
essentially
pours
rich
copper
with
a
torrent
of
carbonation
which
created
a
decent
bubbly
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
clean
crisp
and
malty
with
a
little
toffee
edge
the
flavor
is
toffeelike
a
little
sugary
with
a
pleasant
malty
burn
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
rich
with
a
big
bite
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
brew
extremely
palatable
if
im
not
drinking
an
original
german
brew
ill
be
drinking
oktoberfish
instead
cheers
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
it
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
bready
the
taste
follows
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
lingers
for
a
bit
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
a
solid
fest
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
marzen
for
sure
the
flavors
blend
well
together
and
hide
the
booze
very
well
i
could
session
these
all
night
cheers
poured
rich
brown
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
thin
head
and
little
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
was
a
little
overpoweringly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
apple
and
honey
no
evidence
of
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
was
a
slightly
more
subtle
version
of
the
nose
but
since
i
have
grown
to
appreciate
fullerbodied
maerzens
i
found
the
mouth
to
be
a
little
on
the
thin
side
granted
the
latter
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
but
ill
pick
something
else
to
pair
with
my
wurst
plate
ps
i
love
the
bavarian
flag
background
on
the
label
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
it
smells
full
malt
profile
like
ten
different
kinds
of
bread
at
once
light
hints
of
milk
chocolate
butterless
biscuits
that
damn
delicious
east
coast
mystery
flavor
and
then
some
lightly
spicy
hops
finishing
it
off
nice
and
complex
with
a
lingering
bitterness
the
only
things
i
really
picked
out
of
this
were
a
sort
of
fruity
applelike
flavor
and
aftertaste
reminiscient
of
a
hard
cider
or
such
not
much
of
this
is
present
in
the
smell
though
moth
is
clean
and
crisp
with
noticeable
carbonation
its
easy
to
drink
and
is
refreshing
but
didnt
offer
much
to
take
note
on
that
was
too
special
about
it
appearance
was
just
normal
i
guess
is
all
there
is
to
say
about
it
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
outof
my
way
to
have
it
again
look
for
the
apples
though
d
overall
a
decent
example
and
perhaps
one
of
their
better
beers
making
for
a
good
session
marzen
when
poured
into
a
flying
fish
pint
glass
this
oktoberfest
was
a
clear
and
pale
golden
amber
on
top
of
this
amber
brew
was
a
12
an
ich
head
of
white
foam
this
head
of
foam
had
decent
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
one
single
blot
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
plain
and
simple
with
toasted
malts
with
a
splash
of
juicy
fruits
backing
it
up
the
taste
was
lightly
crispy
with
toasted
malts
a
tiny
touch
of
juicy
fruits
and
a
subtle
hint
of
crispy
floral
hops
at
the
finish
line
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
with
a
crispy
aftertaste
of
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
in
the
end
it
was
stanadrd
drinkable
session
german
style
oktoberfest
beer
you
can
easily
drink
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
nice
effort
not
very
complex
but
overall

nice

the

with
a

of
effervescence
in
the
tongue
and
tocuhes
at
the
throata
rather
swift
rush
overall
strangely
stiff
on
the
malt
almost
making
me
doubt
its
freshness
the
second
bottle
was
a
carbon
copy
pulls
at
the
mouth
and
has
a
malty
woody
pulp
in
its
finishthe
strength
of
its
taste
is
to
be
commended
but
its
maltiness
is
a
bit
overstated
almost
like
it
wandered
through
the
winter
into
bock
season
im
hoping
the
beers
skunked
and
if
it
is
i
will
rewrite
the
reviewif
not
this
is
not
an
enjoyable
brew
for
its
style
with
its
caramelized
sugary
bluntness
dragging
down
the
more
mellow
characteristics
of
the
beer
and
flying
fish
is
usually
on
point
d
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
not
the
best
american
version
of
the
octoberfest
that
i
have
tried
i
think
the
sams
is
more
intense
but
this
was
a
few
bucks
less
and
i
still
think
its
a
damn
fine
octoberfest
d
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
glad
to
try
the
six
pack
one
of
the
better
fall
seasonals
ive
come
accross
this
year
a
coppercolored
brew
with
a
modest
head
that
faded
quickly
carmel
malt
is
the
main
feature
in
the
aroma
the
palate
is
light
to
medium
bodied
again
caramel
malt
in
the
flavor
with
some
graininess
a
quiescent
finish
with
very
little
indication
of
hops
drinkable
for
sure
but
that
is
due
to
its
fairly
runofthemill
flavor
profile
certainly
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
one
and
done
poured
a
light
clear
amber
orange
hue
in
to
the
pint
glass
off
white
two
finger
head
that
dissipated
quite
quickly
thin
layer
of
head
left
on
the
top
decent
carbonation
no
real
lacing
in
the
glass
smell
is
of
a
rather
off
malt
flavor
no
real
caramel
tones
light
scent
for
a
marzen
style
brew
in
my
opinion
dough
like
scent
with
some
floral
hints
had
some
subtle
hop
notes
mixed
in
with
the
malt
scent
some
roasted
malt
flavors
mixed
deep
in
the
nose
taste
was
smooth
and
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
nice
malted
profile
with
a
decent
caramel
tone
mild
hop
taste
in
the
finish
just
a
hint
though
not
very
distinct
the
malt
certainly
takes
the
majority
of
the
flavor
rather
light
bodied
decent
beer
but
not
my
idea
of
a
true
to
style
marzen
oktoberfest
great
drinkability
and
a
good
flavor
lend
to
the
quality
of
this
crafted
brew
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
any
time
i
can
find
it
again
i
picked
up
a
case
in
nj
while
on
a
work
trip
the
ffbc
makes
some
great
products
and
although
this
was
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
it
is
certainly
a
great
fall
time
offering
average
isnt
all
that
bad
if
you
are
looking
to
have
more
than
one
i
prefer
some
of
fly
fish
other
brews
over
this
one
had
it
at
a
beer
swap
and
the
crowd
thought
it
was
just
ok
too
sample
at
the
mill
hill
saloon
in
trenton
nj
the
beer
is
brownishamber
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
that
has
good
retention
thin
rings
of
lacing
bready
malt
grain
and
floral
hops
aroma
medium
body
with
a
mellow
fruit
and
malt
character
and
grassy
hops
in
the
background
the
finish
is
sweet
at
first
with
a
light
hops
and
spicy
alcohol
aftertaste
above
average
overall
i
like
ff
other
offerings
a
bit
more
but
this
is
something
that
i
wouldnt
put
into
this
style
of
beer
didnt
love
it
or
hate
it
i
now
notice
that
the
bottle
claims
this
is
a
germanstyle
ale
i
dont
know
if
this
is
true
or
if
its
there
because
of
any
law
but
if
it
is
an
ale
they
do
a
fantastic
job
disguising
it
id
call
it
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
ofest
style
this
one
has
a
more
pronounced
cream
character
to
it
it
may
mask
some
of
the
malt
but
the
smooth
caramel
still
comes
through
along
with
a
bit
of
german
lager
tang
overall
it
looks
good
its
smooth
drinkable
and
tasty
the
drinkability
for
an
ofest
is
there
but
the
citrus
and
fruit
notes
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
but
you
could
definitley
do
worse
cheers
yet
another
good
beer
produced
in
my
home
state
of
nj
by
the
flying
fish
brewing
co
overallan
ok
beer
brewed
to
style
the
aftertaste
threw
me
a
little
but
it
was
still
a
good
octoberfest
another
solid
brew
made
tostyle
by
flying
fish
but
it
isnt
exceptional
i
had
this
brew
during
a
return
visit
to
the
usa
it
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
very
slight
head
the
aroma
is
notably
malty
with
a
toast
and
caramel
quality
theres
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
aroma
but
its
mostly
about
the
malt
the
taste
is
just
slightly
sweet
with
the
toasted
character
continuing
throughout
theres
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
moderately
sweet
and
with
a
fairly
full
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
although
not
exceptional
oktoberfest
not
bad
this
oktoberfest
poured
reddish
copper
with
a
thin
head
it
smells
clean
malty
with
a
fain
caramel
it
tastes
clean
with
a
malt
complexity
that
is
most
likely
from
munich
andor
vienna
malts
it
is
lightly
hopped
this
beer
has
a
light
clean
body
it
is
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
wont
stand
up
to
all
the
fresh
oktoberfest
beer
that
is
waiting
for
us
in
munich
germany
overall
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
ofest
not
quite
at
the
top
tier
of
the
style
but
worthy
of
a
try
if
its
available
to
you
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
light
and
refreshing
are
great
characteristics
to
have
for
a
beer
along
with
the
sweet
malty
taste
and
only
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
definitely
a
good
brew
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
didnt
seem
to
do
very
well
adhering
to
the
style
it
poured
an
amber
bronze
colour
as
it
should
have
with
a
great
looking
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
but
thats
where
it
ended
smell
was
mostly
malt
but
the
hops
present
are
certainly
either
centennial
or
cascade
grapefruit
pine
resin
in
an
ofest
no
thanks
taste
was
even
worse
not
that
it
tasted
bad
it
was
just
simply
not
an
oktoberfest
and
definately
not
what
i
was
expecting
malt
dominating
at
first
followed
by
a
pronounced
westcoast
style
hoppiness
a
total
disaster
of
an
oktoberfest
but
a
decent
hoppy
amber
ale
of
sorts
i
suppose
drinkability
on
style
with
a
nice
malt
profile
not
overbearing
as
some
can
be
and
delicate
hopping
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
either
no
complexity
and
completely
onesided
malt
is
hardly
prevelant
and
the
floral
hop
is
hidde
in
the
background
things
seem
discombobulated
this
is
nothing
outstanding
but
it
has
pretty
good
characteristics
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
to
it
as
i
mentioned
above
it
is
an
ale
an
amber
ale
with
some
caramel
added
still
in
all
its
certainly
worth
trying
its
smooth
and
has
a
nice
taste
to
it
nice
amber
color
pours
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
shows
virtually
no
carbonation
but
there
is
some
there
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
finish
that
grows
on
you
fairly
middle
of
the
road
for
this
style
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
nice
golden
beer
with
an
orange
hue
poured
out
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
definitly
smelled
like
an
oktoberfest
some
spicy
hops
with
vienna
malt
i
get
the
same
in
the
body
which
also
had
a
slight
grapefruit
taste
rounding
out
the
edge
overall
it
was
very
well
balanced
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinking
oktoberfest
overall
a
delicious
beer
i
noted
it
tasted
heavily
of
caramel
and
malt
i
drank
this
beer
in
under
10
gulps
oktoberfish
from
flying
fish
brewing
company
right
here
in
good
old
new
jersey
pours
a
light
coppery
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
ciderlike
aroma
a
bit
sweet
with
a
bitter
woody
finish
this
one
is
a
little
over
carbonated
i
suggest
letting
it
rest
in
the
glass
several
minutes
before
drinking
the
carbonation
will
go
down
to
a
more
drinkable
level
and
the
flavor
will
become
fuller
and
sweeter
as
it
warms
a
little
of
a
recent
sampling
i
did
of
several
fest
beers
from
both
the
us
and
germany
over
the
past
few
weeks
this
one
was
relatively
average
mouthfeel
is
slightly
crisp
at
the
start
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
thinner
in
body
than
other
oktoberfests
nicely
drinkable
but
there
are
better
oktoberfests
on
the
market
this
isnt
a
beer
to
be
chugged
down
but
it
stands
out
from
the
other
octoberfests
ive
had
warms
ya
up
inside
has
nice
tarty
notes
to
it
and
is
wonderful
to
swish
around
and
build
the
head
up
sip
by
sip
worth
the
money
and
slowing
down
to
appreciate
all
of
its
notes
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
copper
with
modest
offwhite
head
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
toasty
and
caramely
notes
presemnt
taste
is
a
very
sweetish
malt
initially
there
was
a
mega
hops
presence
but
this
seemed
to
diminish
with
subsequent
sips
finish
is
somewhat
dry
a
little
too
dry
for
my
taste
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
fantastic
a
nice
easy
drinker
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
it
is
not
chockfull
of
flavor
yet
it
is
quite
satisfying
definitely
a
beer
to
be
quaffed
in
great
quantities
it
does
not
have
nearly
the
hop
character
that
i
like
to
see
in
an
alt
but
it
does
have
that
nice
fruity
finish
that
i
find
typical
of
the
style
i
dropped
the
drinkability
off
a
bit
here
because
i
found
this
one
to
be
rather
sweet
to
which
i
enjoyed
however
i
know
not
all
people
enjoy
sweet
brews
so
i
decided
that
i
doubt
i
could
drink
a
growler
of
it
so
hence
a
lower
score
here
however
i
liked
it
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
good
dutiful
rendition
of
the
style
in
my
eyes
at
least
and
is
a
joy
to
drink
while
nothing
here
will
leap
out
and
grab
you
it
will
pat
you
gently
and
allow
you
to
enjoy
one
after
the
other
though
responsibly
of
course
for
being
brewed
in
my
backyard
i
think
its
one
of
the
more
faithful
oktoberfest
beers
whose
label
isnt
printed
at
least
partially
in
german
smooth
and
easy
to
like
it
makes
more
than
one
a
pleasant
task
to
undertake
it
pours
a
medium
brownamber
with
a
mediumsized
foamy
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
malts
are
dominant
in
the
nose
of
course
with
aromas
of
caramel
butterscotch
nuts
and
hints
of
fruit
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
light
lemony
bitterness
to
back
it
up
pear
and
white
wine
notes
in
there
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
light
sweetness
late
it
has
a
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
more
impressive
oktoberfest
seasonals
ive
had
this
year
enough
character
and
body
to
keep
me
interested
but
still
highly
sessionable
id
buy
it
again
if
i
could
get
it
in
this
area
poured
clear
copper
with
a
very
generous
white
head
a
very
nice
pouring
beer
if
i
may
say
so
the
head
was
relatively
long
lasting
and
left
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
withdrew
aroma
was
malty
and
sweet
though
not
heavily
so
a
touch
of
smoke
taste
was
balanced
over
all
starting
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
fading
into
a
short
dry
finish
pleasant
brew
that
paired
nicely
with
sausage
spaetzel
cabbage
and
crusty
bread
overall
fairly
nice
local
example
of
a
domestic
ofest
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
this
year
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
sessional
brew
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
favourites
from
the
folks
at
flying
fish
mouthfeel
is
good
this
one
always
surprisingly
gets
better
for
some
reason
i
much
prefer
the
draft
to
the
bottle
though
medium
bodied
tawny
chestnut
brown
toasted
grain
and
malt
nose
hops
are
only
lightly
detectable
not
as
full
bodied
or
complex
as
some
german
examples
though
has
a
solid
malt
character
with
wheat
grain
and
dried
fruit
characteristics
hops
barely
bite
in
the
finish
and
could
use
more
bitterness
for
balance
the
sweetness
still
a
nice
local
session
beer
as
the
seasons
change
for
that
inbetween
period
of
philadelphia
weather
not
quite
cool
yet
but
thankfully
the
blistering
humidity
is
gone
the
mates
and
i
bought
a
case
and
it
didnt
last
but
a
day
or
two
not
too
shabby
i
recomend
buying
soon
as
it
is
very
limited
something
different
a
real
treat
poured
clear
bright
with
an
orangecopper
color
a
thin
head
of
off
white
foam
topped
off
this
one
the
aroma
is
interesting
and
a
bit
strange
light
toffee
and
caramel
malt
but
also
has
some
perfume
like
notes
that
i
guess
are
coming
from
the
hops
taste
has
a
grainy
sour
quality
that
just
doesnt
some
to
meld
properly
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
guess
this
can
be
called
an
eclectic
oktoberfest
rather
than
an
authentic
one
lightly
sweet
and
malty
in
the
finish
not
bad
with
points
for
originality
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
wellcarbonated
liquid
that
was
orangebrownamber
in
color
the
head
that
was
created
off
white
to
light
toupe
in
color
fairly
thick
and
creamy
to
the
taste
ant
touch
some
stickiness
was
noticed
there
was
some
spotty
lace
throughout
the
glass
not
like
a
true
lace
but
more
left
over
spots
that
drug
to
the
bottom
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
on
the
light
side
but
roasted
malts
and
nuts
were
noticeable
some
dry
leafs
earthy
ash
light
fruit
in
the
later
aromas
and
finished
off
with
a
yeasty
appeal
to
it
the
flavors
from
this
beer
seemed
to
be
bolder
and
more
pronounced
then
the
aromas
tastes
of
cocoa
nuts
dark
roasted
malts
some
leafs
and
ash
were
present
all
through
each
sip
some
sweet
fruits
were
noticeable
as
it
warmed
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
as
well
as
some
light
herbal
hops
and
dirt
but
one
thing
was
consistent
was
the
all
end
sips
were
of
yeast
and
yeasty
nut
bread
the
aftertaste
that
was
left
was
of
bread
yeast
and
a
dry
feeling
on
the
tongue
the
body
was
on
the
light
to
medium
side
interesting
beer
seemed
to
have
lots
of
malt
and
earthy
flavors
that
were
pronounced
and
consistent
all
through
each
sip
an
enjoyable
beer
and
real
easy
to
drink
a
definite
session
brew
i
enjoyed
them
through
two
straight
football
games
this
weekend
12
ounce
bottle
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
easily
my
favorite
flying
fish
brew
good
stuff
regardless
of
ale
or
lager
dont
geek
drink
anyways
this
fall
ale
isnt
bad
it
looks
nice
lighter
than
a
true
marzen
it
has
a
surprising
amount
of
fall
spice
in
the
smell
and
taste
nutmeg
and
ginger
mostly
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
hop
character
and
bitterness
of
this
thats
what
really
made
me
think
hmmm
not
a
real
marzen
the
malts
are
there
to
lend
a
little
sweetness
a
little
of
that
nutty
sweetly
esteric
flavor
but
only
just
a
little
this
stays
easily
drinkable
and
nicely
even
in
its
elements
just
dont
call
it
an
octoberfest
call
it
a
seasonal

a
lager
a
good
beerdecent
fall
seasonal
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
sampling
this
one
as
the
2003
version
reviews
were
mediocre
while
im
not
sure
this
meets
the
usual
requirements
of
an
oktoberfest
it
is
damn
good
the
mouthfeel
is
especially
intriguingi
wasnt
sure
i
liked
it
all
that
much
until
i
had
sampled
a
couple
in
taste
i
think
it
rivals
the
ofests
from
germany
which
are
available
in
the
usa
unfortunately
i
cant
get
this
one
in
ct
but
got
a
six
in
nj
visiting
the
inlaws
this
past
weekend
will
ask
them
to
get
some
more
for
me
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
can
find
it
good
job
to
the
folks
in
cherry
hill
nj
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
astringent
mouthfeel
probably
due
to
the
alcohol
dark
pinkish
amber
color
nice
fluffy
white
head
sweet
malt
caramel
nose
with
sharp
hop
notes
initial
stinging
taste
of
hops
is
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
coated
tongue
and
throat
medium
slightly
thickish
mouth
very
hoppy
and
bitter
for
a
marzen
not
a
traditional
tasting
brew
the
errors
however
lean
to
my
taste
preferences
silky
smooth
as
you
would
imagine
out
of
the
cask
the
body
was
medium
and
not
lacking
a
bit
at
all
i
would
definitely
not
call
this
your
typical
oktoberfest
bier
but
it
was
enjoyable
much
more
floral
than
its
deutsche
counterparts
flying
fish
gave
this
brew
an
interesting
little
twist
sweet
malts
balance
the
hops
well
to
make
for
a
simple
but
good
brew
it
is
definitely
more
along
the
lines
of
a
cask
ale
than
an
oktober
another
amazing
seasonal
from
the
fish
folks
pours
a
deep
copperish
color
with
a
tan
head
which
leaves
a
good
lace
on
the
nose
the
aromas
are
of
bread
or
toast
and
slight
caramel
on
the
palate
more
of
the
same
light
toasted
bread
a
touch
of
caramel
lightly
hopped
slight
bitterness
followed
by
more
maltsemm
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
night
at
the
grey
lodge
2002
version
not
the
ordinary
fest
beer
savory
malt
profile
generous
hop
finish
this
beer
is
intended
for
draft
only
although
i
tried
it
in
both
cask
version
and
bottle
today
its
very
deep
copper
almost
brown
in
color
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
some
very
good
lace
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
a
toasty
munich
malt
very
clean
and
nice
there
is
a
light
fruitiness
but
it
doesnt
seem
out
of
character
for
a
dark
lager
beer
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
is
standard
but
it
definitely
has
a
presence
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
with
a
munich
maltiness
followed
by
a
nice
light
hop
flavor
almost
unoticeable
at
first
but
then
reveals
a
moderate
bitterness
and
finishes
fairly
dry
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
are
present
but
dont
really
go
any
further
than
that
a
nice
beer
with
an
interesting
toasted
malt
profile
but
not
overly
exciting
compared
to
standard
oktoberfests
still
an
enjoyable
quaff
for
the
fall
season
herbalhop
taste
overall
too
dry
and
smoky
for
my
liking
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
solid
example
of
a
festbier
pours
cloudy
orange
brown
with
a
nominal
off
white
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
of
biscuit
caramel
malts
and
some
light
bittering
hops
flavors
are
straight
forward
for
the
style
rich
caramel
malts
on
all
sides
with
a
bready
characteristic
and
light
bittering
hops
to
the
rear
smooth
lightly
coating
mouth
feel
finishes
wet
with
a
light
sweet
aftertaste
mingling
with
light
hops
very
true
to
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
very
flavorful
fullon
malt
character
rich
in
dark
malt
and
woody
nutty
flavors
poured
into
tumbler
brown
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
smell
is
sweet
caramel
malty
taste
is
dry
sweet
bold
malt
i
do
not
like
marzens
mostly
and
this
we
not
much
different
than
those
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
because
it
tends
to
tilt
toward
malt
and
im
a
hop
lover
this
beer
is
definitely
malt
forward
but
there
is
enough
hop
balance
to
make
it
interesting
to
me
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
this
was
part
of
a
flight
for
me
this
pours
with
a
cloudy
yet
bright
amber
hue
and
a
tidy
close
knit
head
the
nose
is
quite
malty
with
a
sweet
grain
barley
roasted
nut
and
biscuity
aroma
the
flavors
emulate
the
nose
with
a
more
toasted
tone
the
malts
are
kilned
and
toasty
with
a
prominent
pecan
very
smooth
lager
but
the
flavors
of
an
ale
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
poor
retention
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
was
lacking
that
dry
bready
oktoberfest
profile
chalky
mouthfeel
im
usually
a
fan
of
victory
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
i
would
recommend
most
german
and
some
other
american
versions
of
the
style
over
this
one
overall
a
4
for
festbier
victory
brewing
company
i
might
grab
this
again
but
it
wasnt
anything
to
write
home
about
tasted
more
like
an
altbier
to
me
than
an
oktoberfest
but
i
love
me
an
altbier
not
bad
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
either
a
near
perfect
oktoberfest
the
best
american
marzen
ive
had
extremely
smooth
rich
and
delicious
lacks
body
not
a
huge
fan
of
malt
but
this
one
could
use
a
bit
more
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
memorable
either
overall
tastes
good
maybe
this
bottle
was
flat
light
brownishcopper
nose
is
bready
and
nutty
the
flavor
profile
is
solid
but
not
particularly
impressive
there
is
also
an
odd
off
sour
note
in
the
flavor
toasty
sweet
malt
backs
a
light
hop
presence
quite
drinkable
and
mouthfeel
spot
on
meh
a
subpar
oktoberfest
offering
too
sweet
one
dimensional
and
coming
off
like
a
sodabeer
malty
but
thats
all
thats
going
on
here
like
wet
biscuits
but
in
a
bad
way
not
terrible
but
not
a
beer
id
return
to
especially
with
so
many
great
examples
of
the
style
during
the
height
of
the
season
overall
this
is
an
insanely
drinkable
beer
although
it
could
be
construed
by
some
as
a
rich
beer
it
just
goes
down
so
easy
this
is
what
marzen
should
taste
like
to
me
this
is
my
new
favorite
octoberfest
had
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
mug
the
color
is
perfect
a
reddish
copper
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
outstanding
its
a
smoky
mix
of
molasses
and
malt
capturing
the
flavor
while
avoiding
the
syrupy
constitution
of
some
other
offerings
of
the
genre
love
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
and
clear
amber
a
thin
and
fizzy
white
head
dissipates
quickly
but
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
leaves
some
bubbles
at
the
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
all
i
get
is
caramel
its
almost
too
sweet
bordering
on
candy
the
taste
has
a
much
more
refined
caramel
quality
with
a
little
nutty
aspect
and
theres
just
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
a
little
thinner
on
the
body
but
not
off
a
slight
tickle
from
the
carbonation
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
nice
overall
i
had
never
really
been
into
marzenoctoberfest
beers
until
i
went
to
a
tasting
i
tried
3
including
ayinger
oktober
festmarzen
and
firestone
walker
oaktoberfest
i
felt
that
this
was
on
the
same
level
as
firestone
walker
but
not
as
good
as
ayinger
light
toasty
grains
and
they
marginally
outsized
sugary
quality
decent
enough
but
this
lacks
the
depth
and
breadth
of
maltiness
that
i
was
hoping
for
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
victory
t
clean
malt
taste
but
not
smooth
low
hop
flavor
slight
bitterness
only
moderately
sweet
3
55
toasted
hay
o
was
expecting
more
from
victory
this
is
a
little
disappointing
wishing
i
didnt
have
a
6
pack
märzens
arent
the
most
complex
to
begin
with
but
this
is
has
a
distinct
lack
of
flavor
appearance
could
use
some
work
too
overall
not
the
greatest
oktoberfest
brew
but
worth
downing
a
sixer
or
two
while
i
love
victorys
prima
pils
and
hop
devil
this
was
a
disappointment
overall
an
unbalanced
beer
that
i
wouldnt
pick
up
again
if
you
are
looking
for
an
easydrinking
octoberfest
there
are
better
options
out
there
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
6er
because
we
had
this
at
octoberfest
night
for
beer
club
and
somehting
was
off
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
was
much
harsh
hoppy
not
malty
might
have
gone
skunky
on
us
chill
haze
and
tiny
headno
lacing
detract
from
appearance
the
malt
overpowers
the
hops
resulting
in
an
unbalanced
brew
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
lively
bordering
on
aggressive
very
nice
and
smooth
beer
with
a
bit
of
hop
to
finish
overall
a
near
perfect
octoberfest
in
my
opinion
so
flavorful
the
malt
taste
in
this
beer
is
great
well
done
and
a
must
try
oktoberfest
o
very
nice
and
perfect
for
fall
o
a
solid
oktoberfest
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
as
so
many
seem
similar
to
me
and
there
isnt
much
variation
it
seems
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
though
somehwta
complex
full
of
flavor
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
it
overall
this
is
a
first
for
the
marzen
style
this
is
a
well
polished
well
balanced
and
highly
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
worthy
o
i
love
marzens
and
i
love
festbier

envision
a

punch
up

wbittersweet
seems
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
more
than
a
pair
o
pints
but
worthy
overall
rjt
o
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
pleasant
overall
overall
a
tasty
and
simple
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
o
good
marzen
style
of
beer
victory
is
usually
reliable
when
it
comes
to
their
styles
a
nice
beer
but
i
think
it
lacks
a
little
bitterness
bite
near
the
end
like
i
expect
in
an
oktoberfest
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
a
fall
session
beer
for
sure
however
victory

45
o
a
good
octoberfest
beer
worth
having
perfect
clear
amber
color
with
very
little
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
of
very
sweet
caramel
and
not
too
much
else
taste
is
definitely
of
caramel
and
a
good
biscuityness
to
it
as
well
lighter
carbonation
than
i
would
expect
but
not
terrible
good
body
too
overall
a
very
good
octoberfest
beer
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
a
couple
of
months
ago
overall
it
is
a
nice
drinkable
fall
lager
overall
a
solid
fall
classic
from
victory
simple
easy
and
drinkable
overall
above
average
good
beer
which
seems
to
be
a
good
representation
of
a
style
i
generally
dont
like
but
need
to
have
more
experience
with
definitely
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
the
star
overall
this
is
another
solid
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
and
sweetness
id
certainly
get
it
again
this
one
pours
a
nice
deep
orange
color
with
some
rubyredpink
grapefruit
highlights
starchwhite
head
that
collapses
to
a
thin
layer
not
overly
malty
on
the
nose
some
yeasty
bread
honey
nuts
candied
fruit
a
little
funk
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
vanilla
followed
by
tangy
fruit
some
citrus
pine
minerals
and
hops
and
the
hops
linger
for
me
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
too
carbonated
for
an
oktoberfest
but
victory
being
victory
i
guess
we
should
have
expected
more
hops
than
less
overall
has
some
unique
and
tasty
qualities
of
which
i
was
appreciative
even
if
they
didnt
come
together
as
nicely
as
one
might
hope
for
easy
drinking
despite
the
long
list
of
descriptors
would
choose
it
over
many
octoberfests
nutty
toasted
malt
flavor
grain
husks
apples
fall
leaves
very
light
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
up
front
otherwise
dry
and
crisp
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
full
and
almost
chewy
for
a
lager
a
delicious
and
traditional
american
oktoberfest
definitely
a
staple
ill
be
looking
for
every
fall
side
note
this
was
a
top
3
finalist
up
against
a
dozen
other
oktoberfests
at
a
recent
tasting
a
very
well
done
marzen
one
of
the
top
american
examples
i
have
tried
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
and
am
very
happy
i
did
certainly
a
go
to
example
of
the
style
victory
has
the
habit
of
making
clean
and
crisp
brews
that
are
sharp
meaning
distinct
and
clear
thats
what
this
beer
was
clean
subtly
sweet
and
earthy
it
has
abundant
flavor
and
a
palate
that
is
ready
for
anything
from
burgers
to
pasta
primavera
overall
one
of
the
best
american
oktoberfestbiere
that
ive
had
so
far
this
season
we
will
see
how
it
compares
to
ayinger
oktober
festmärzen
one
of
the
best
german
versions
of
this
style
in
a
few
days
overall
im
generally
pleased
and
would
gladly
order
this
at
a
bar
whether
i
buy
it
for
home
consumption
remains
to
be
seen
o
enjoyable
fairly
flawless
except
for
slight
oxidation
i
am
getting
in
taste
simple
yet
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
good
octoberfest
a
bit
weak
on
the
aroma
but
full
in
flavor
highly
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
your
dollars

medium

perfect
octobertime
beer
smell
and
tastes
arent

if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
but
throwing
back
one
or
two
of
these
on
a
nice
autumn
day
would
be
ideal
o
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
glad
i
got
two
of
them
and
ill
likely
be
going
back
for
more
although
i
prefer
the
caramel
sweetness
from
samuel
adams
octoberfest
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
hell
doesnt
need
to
be
one
or
the
other
ill
have
both
overy
nice
beer
that
surprised
me
from
my
first
whiffs
of
it
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
another
mediocre
oktoberfest
but
once
i
tasted
it
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
yet
another
high
quality
offering
from
victory
im
surprised
this
isnt
rated
higher
grab
some
if
you
see
it
o
this
has
surpassed
great
lakes
oktoberfest
and
is
now
my
favorite
try
it
i
dont
understand
the
mediocre
ratings
this
is
good
stuff
o
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
like
to
think
of
octoberfest
beers
as
something
i
could
sit
down
with
and
consume
a
fair
amount
of
this
doesnt
really
fit
that
description
highly
drinkable
would
make
a
great
food
beer
another
good
german
style
offering
from
victory
3
5
o
i
like
this
one
a
lot
its
well
crafted
hoppy
yet
balanced
very
well
there
isnt
much
more
to
say
other
than
the
fact
that
its
quite
good
great
job
victory
appearance
clear
amber
almost
light
ruby
red
hue
with
one
inch
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
keeps
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
light
bready
malt
with
caramel
and
grassy
spicy
hop
notes
taste
caramel
with
a
light
nuttiness
and
sweet
pilsner
malt
are
equaled
by
spicy
grass
with
light
floral
hop
flavor
that
keeps
till
the
end
overall
not
a
bad
beer
wish
breadiness
would
stand
up
stronger
against
the
hops
overall
id
have
to
believe
this
ones
been
on
the
self
for
a
good
8
or
9
months
but
based
on
my
enjoyment
id
say
its
held
up
well
this
is
one
ill
have
to
try
fresh
come
septemberoctober
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
top
3
favorite
beers
out
there
if
not
my
favorite
i
found
this
bottle
in
the
basement
thinking
that
all
of
them
from
the
case
bought
in
septembers
case
were
gone
what
a
surprise
but
its
always
available
at
the
brewery
thank
god
overall
this
makes
for
a
very
tasty
version
of
an
oktoberfest
bier
i
will
have
to
pick
this
up
again
in
the
fall
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
copper
color
produced
a
above
average
white
head
nice
retention
and
it
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
piney
hops
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
a
semi
dry
bitter
hop
finish
very
nice
session
beer
and
nice
example
of
a
oktoberfest
beer
a
verry
good
beer
from
victory
they
havent
done
me
rong
yet
i
will
drink
this
one
again
overall
i
like
it
another
good
offering
from
victory
beer
has
a
medium
to
mediumlight
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
creating
a
beer
that
slightly
fizzes
across
the
palate
ultimately
coming
across
as
crisp
and
smooth
closes
semidry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
ok
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
i
didnt
pick
up
any
hops
just
lots
of
malts
that
seemed
a
little
too
dull
for
the
style
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
but
the
flavors
didnt
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
would
rather
have
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
the
truest
to
style
and
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
boring
this
beer
was
a
little
hops
would
have
helped
this
beer
out
and
impart
a
little
bit
of
complexity
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
theres
many
other
marzens
that
i
would
much
rather
have
and
would
buy
instead
its
worth
trying
if
you
really
like
the
style
but
i
dont
think
it
will
make
the
top
of
anybodys
list
of
great
marzens
all
in
all
this
beer
was
pretty
middle
of
the
road
and
not
that
memorable
i
have
yet
to
be
really
impressed
by
victory
most
of
their
beers
seem
to
be
pretty
average
better
luck
next
time
guys
bottle
poured
a
clear

color
beer
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
grainy
notes
with
light
dry
caramel
malt
notes
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
grainy
cereal
notes
with
a
dryer
then
expected
caramel
malt
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
easily
drinkable
though
finish
is
not
as
clean
as
i
would
have
expected
overall
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
an
octoberfest
definately
one
of
the
better
ones
oi
wonder
why
i
drink
oktoberfests
this
beer
didnt
bring
much
to
the
table
at
least
it
wasnt
awful
but
boring
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
an
awesome
oktoberfest
style
beer
right
up
my
alley
much
bolder
with
more
to
offer
than
any
of
the
big
name
german
marzens
ive
tried
pours
medium
amber
some
orange
light
layer
of
white
foam
that
splits
apart
malty
nose
some
cinammonnutmeg
spice
taste
is
a
rich
chewy
caramel
malt
hearty
malt
there
is
a
barely
noticeable
hop
at
the
close
real
flavorful
marzen
maybe
a
touch
short
on
bite
o
this
beer
is
surprisingly
complex
and
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
better
than
i
thought
itd
be
the
taste
is
as
malty
as
the
aroma
and
significantly
sweeter
than
what
i
got
on
the
nose
a
modest
lingering
finish
ties
it
all
together
it
isnt
all
that
bad
and
is
entirely
drinkable
m
moderately
high
carbonation
with
a
moderately
light
body
fairly
dry
finish
that
may
be
due
to
a
bit
of
astringency
a
deep
copper
brown
color
with
a
modest
white
cover
that
dissipates
quickly
to
random
swirls
lacing
is
fair
the
aroma
is
no
doubt
cabbage
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
herbal
hop
pretty
neat
the
flavor
is
absolutely
in
keeping
with
the
nose
hit
a
beautiful
malt
bath
with
an
herbal
hop
edge
that
makes
for
a
lucid
dry
feel
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
a
very
satisfying
octoberfest
beer
that
i
would
easily
recommend
autumnal
malt
fans
medium
bodied
and
a
feel
of
medium
to
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
balanced
between
the
caramel
malts
and
hop
bitterness
overall
i
liked
this
oktoberfest
but
would
prefer
a
bit
less
hop
profile
verdict
skip
o
an
american
nw
take
on
the
style
that
respects
the
traditional
foundation
of
toasted
malts
and
caramels
but
still
has
the
need
to
make
sure
the
hops
are
noticed
if
youre
expecting
a
marzen
youll
probably
find
the
overall
effort
outofbalance
probably
better
paired
with
food
where
the
hops
can
find
more
to
balance
with
than
drunk
alone
roasted
malt
and
caramel
up
front
followed
by
bitter
herb
it
has
a
nice
balance
and
a
full
body
it
has
a
chewy
nutty
bread
like
mouth
feel
this
is
a
real
good
octoberfest
this
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
o
a
super
tasty
solid
oktoberfest
that
doesnt
differentiate
too
much
from
other
available
marzens
but
i
feel
victory
has
produced
one
that
is
very
true
to
style
8
for
a
6
pack
is
a
great
price
to
pay
overall
other
than
the
lack
luster
aroma
this
is
one
really
fantastic
and
tasty
beer
it
is
one
i
will
definitely
go
to
again
it
has
great
flavors
and
a
very
nice
feel
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
the
carbonation
doesnt
add
much
pop
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
very
balanced
and
ever
so
slightly
peppery
a
very
subtle
and
malty
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
with
minimal
retention
and
lace
smells
of
caramel
and
bread
and
a
bit
of
toast
with
an
earthy
floral
hop
component
to
it
the
flavor
is
bready
pilsner
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
sweet
sugary
malt
a
bit
heavy
on
the
hops
for
the
style
lots
of
earthy
herbal
hops
compete
with
an
inadequate
malt
base
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
an
earthy
slick
mouthfeel
decent
enough
beer
but
like
a
lot
of
american
interpretations
it
just
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
german
brewed
versions
12

and
lightly
slick

finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
lager
nicely
robust

good

extremely
smooth

this

not
impressed
overall
pretty
impressed
and
a
solid
marzen
to
be
had
with
a
lot
of
flavor
o
victory
festbier
might
just
be
the
ultimate
oktoberfest
crisp
and
clean
it
adheres
to
its
strict
lager
standards
and
showcases
deep
malt
complexity
while
adding
a
simplistic
but
ohsoimportant
kiss
of
hops
all
while
remaining
exceptionally
drinkable
especially
for
its
robust
body
a
moment
of
pause
to
consider
the
skill
required
to
brew
such
a
balanced
and
immaculate
beer
is
rewarding
but
equally
as
rewarding
is
losing
ones
self
in
the
festivities
and
enjoying
pint
after
pint
of
such
a
beer
overall
a
very
good
american
take
on
a
marzen
full
bready
malt
flavor
with
some

subtle
roast

the

a

octoberfest
beer
but
not
among
my
favorites
ohad
it
not
been
described
as
an
oktoberfest
then
i
may
have
seen
this
beer
differently
but
overall
i
will
avoid
festbeer
in
the
future

faint

and
faint

still
some
mineral
qualities
lighter
than
expected
very
few
bubbles
of

this
brew
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
active
carbonation
there
was
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
that
this
brew
was
a
little
thin
and
not
what
i
would
consider
for
the
body
of
an
oktoberfest
on
the
nose
i
gotnothing
no
joke
not
a
thing
it
was
like
sniffing
water
maybe
if
i
thought
really
hard
about
it
i
could
get
some
sort
of
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
it
would
be
a
reach
the
taste
is
primarily
watery
just
how
it
looked
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
taste
on
it
maybe
some
sweet
malt
on
the
taste
and
a
hint
of
earthiness
im
surprised
about
the
lack
of
flavor
in
this
brew
i
didnt
really
like
it
and
would
not
get
it
again
definitely
underflavored
my
favorite
american
representation
recommended
4
5
excellant
version
that
i
look
forward
to
each
college
football
season
these
folks
know
how
to
brew
quality
brew
go
gamecocks
i
have
yet
to
dislike
a
beer
from
this
brewery
this
is
no
exception
will
buy
more
if
i
come
across
it
again
o
cant
get
past
the
odd
scent
of
this
one
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
for
a
marzen
i
have
plent
yof
other
options
o
a
nice
ofest
that
displays
a
bunch
of
the
characteristics
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
too
solid
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
a
marzenoktoberfest
that
exist
in
todays
market
the
caramel
sweet
maltiness
is
probably
overstated
for
the
style
but
i
enjoy
that
more
than
one
that
is
heavy
on
grainy
pilsnery
flavors
good
not
great
worth
a
go
amongst
others
othis
isnt
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
well
and
its
not
drinkable
as
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
solid
fest
beer
but
nothing
special
at
the
high
price
point
its
not
especially
desirable
o
a
highly
drinkable
flavorful
marzen
its
pretty
standard
for
the
style
and
doesnt
really
bring
anything
too
new
to
the
table
its
easy
to
appreciate
the
simplicity
of
this
beer
though
a
perfect
fall
party
beer
odone
of
the
better
takes
on
a
style
i
dont
love
enjoyed
the
hop
intensity
another
solid
victory
brew
this
was
the
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
and
oktoberfest
lager
from
victory
so
i
had
to
pick
it
up
probably
one
of
the
best
american
made
versions
of
this
style
of
beer
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
for
a
decotion
mash
being
used
would
have
liked
to
see
a
more
assertive
malt
background
and
less
bitterness
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
initially
generous
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
strong
with
bread
and
biscuit
scents
standing
out
toasted
bready
malts
are
dominant
in
the
taste
reminding
me
of
sourdough
bread
there
is
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
and
a
floral
bitterness
in
the
finish
just
average
mouthfeel
nothing
really
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
nothing
bad
either
quite
nice
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
i
love
this
style
but
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
too
many
this
one
is
good
but
perhaps
in
a
month
i
might
say
differently
overall
typical
large
craft
brewery
marzen
doesnt
have
the
spiciness
or
malt
profile
to
stand
out
or
be
memorable
very
drinkable
and

again
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
kinda
average
nothing
spectacular
about
it
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
nice
tangerine
highlights
the
tan
head
displayed
decent
lacing
and
moderate
lacing
as
well
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
bread
butter
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
the
flavors
were
an
interesting
balance
of
very
sweet
caramel
malt
and
dry
but
floral
hops
the
bready
malt
and
dry
yeast
also
came
through
in
the
middle
and
i
also
got
some
toast
and
pine
nuts
as
it
warmed
up
the
sweetness
seemed
a
little
too
much
for
a
marzen
to
me
and
i
wasnt
exactly
wowed
but
i
suppose
this
could
just
be
my
impression
of
the
victory
interpretation
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
moderate
the
beer
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
that
thins
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
carmel
and
malty
the
malt
hits
you
up
front
first
thing
i
taste
then
some
earthy
hops
comes
along
but
not
strong
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
average
marzen
taste
is
good
it
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
it
is
very
malty
and
low
on
hops
taste
is
pretty
balanced
and
has
a
hint
of
sweet
or
nutty
finish
is
a
little
plain
the
rest
a
decent
medium
bodied
marzen
nothing
spectacular
though
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
makes
it
very
drinkable
slightly
dry
finish
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
finalim
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
out
of
all
of
the
marzens
ive
tried
this
probably
has
the
least
amount
of
bubbles
in
it
im
not
sure
i
personally
like
it
due
to
the
odd
sweetness
but
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
severely
offend
anyone
its
fairly
balanced
though
a
little
bit
off
kilter
on
the
sweetness
but
overall
worth
a
go
for
the
price
if
you
dont
mind
a
fairly
flat
marzen
maybe
this
bottle
wasnt
any
good
because
i
know
it
wasnt
old
and
my
review
seems
quite
contrary
to
the
others
o
a
lot
of
nice
aspects
to
this
one
but
i
really
didnt
dig
the
flavor
not
a
bad
version
of
the
style
and
appropriately
priced
for
those
who
are
fans
of
this
overall
solid
marzen
o
if
youre
picking
out
an
american
interpretation
of
a
marzen
this
is
the
one
in
my
opinion
i
bought
multiple
6ers
of
this
its
a
great
beer
decent
but
pretty
unremarkable
lacks
complexity
drinks
more
like
a
red
lager
with
some
fall
vibes
rather
than
a
true
oktoberfest
this
is
a
top
tier
oktoberfestmarzen
for
me
up
there
with
great
lakes
take
on
the
style
i
would
love
to
sample
both
to
see
which
one
i
prefer
but
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
case
worthy
indeed
four
starsout
of
four
a
marzen
that
is
a
bit
above
average
overall
good
not
great
oktoberfest
not
a
lot
of
balance
for
me
this
is
a
rock
solid
marzen
offering
for
the
season
i
started
lukewarm
on
the
offering
but
am
on
my
3rd
6er
i
really
enjoy
southern
tiers
autumn
ale
but
until
someone
gives
me
a
better
oktoberfest
spirited
lager
this
is
the
go
to
this
season
o
victory
strikes
again
great
fall
beer
traditional
american
marzen
beer
this
actually
has
a
lovely
rye
taste
to
it
nice
and
malty
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
nice
blend
of
flavors
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
nice
carbonated
tingle
but
not
heavy
very
complex
and
wellexecuted
o
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
rather
like
this
one
it
is
remarkably
drinkable
boulevard
in
jtown
pa
had
the
victory
festbier
on
tap
it
poured
a
clear
amber
with
decent
frothy
head
and
laced
the
aroma
included
malt
barley
and
some
spiciness
the
tase
was
powered
by
barley
and
malt
very
grainy
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
over
all
it
was
oknever
been
that
big
of
a
october
marzen
fan
certainly
worth
a
try
though
a
decent
fest
beer
worthy
of
a
try
but
is
a
crowded
season
of
seasonal
fall
beers
it
is
hard
to
put
this
ahead
of
so
many
other
great
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
beers
out
there
overall
nothing
about
this
beer
really
jumps
out
at
me
except
that
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
do
a
well
done
interpretation
by
victory
nice
malt
characteristics
and
a
balanced
sweetness
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
takes
on
a
german
märzen
recommended
cheers
drinkability
nothing
too
complex
but
it
is
a
solid
brew
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
millstreams
oktoberfest
from
last
year
o
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
pretty
good
the
flavor
was
good
not
great
but
good
the
mouthfeel
was
okay
i
liked
the
great
lakes
oktoberfest
better
but
this
wasnt
bad
it
poured
a
healthy
reddish
nut
brown
and
smelled
of
toffee
and
molasses
low
carbonation
but
enough
to
be
refreshing
it
tastes
great
full
of
flavor
with
little
after
taste
it
seems
that
marzens
dont
really
score
to
well
on
ba
understandably
so
as
they
really
arent
amazing
beers
in
general
but
comparing
apples
to
apples
this
stands
out
as
a
pretty
good
choice
i
would
buy
again
too
much
carbonation
its
fizzy
and
prickly
the
finish
is
dry
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
oktoberfest
style
beers
but
its
pretty
good
not
really
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
o
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
not
bad
unoffensive
but
nothing
special
id
actually
take
sam
adams
octoberfest
over
this
or
paulaner
though
overall
im
just
not
in
love
with
this
beer
there
are
oktoberfests
that
i
like
but
this
just
aint
one
of
em
poured
into
a
chilled
mug
head
pops
up
then
dies
completely
thin
lacing
but
as
i
say
the
head
deteriorates
almost
immediately
garnet
color
and
very
clear
smells
of
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
bitter
orange
very
creamy
mouthfeel
smooth
as
silk
going
down
flavors
of
toasty
malt
nice
orange
spicy
hoppy
citrus
with
a
slight
metallic
wash
that
pierces
through
in
the
finish
refreshing
somewhat
spiky
carbonation
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
very
drinkable
noticeably
less
malty
than
other
octoberfest
brews
which
is
a
nice
change
this
is
a
brewery
that
knows
what
it
is
doing
producing
consistently
good
beer
and
this
festbier
is
no
exception
youll
want
more
than
one
of
these
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
nice
tan
head
the
beer
smelled
a
little
fruity
but
did
not
taste
that
way
the
color
of
the
beer
was
orange
and
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
caramel
i
liked
the
beer
and
would
buy
again
o
festbier
is
not
a
bad
seasonal
brew
but
much
like
the
chiefs
i
do
not
associate
fall
with
victory
i
felt
this
was
a
good
oktoberfest
and
would
recommend
overall
really
nice
refreshing
fall
beer
ive
picked
this
up
the
past
two
falls
and
like
sitting
back
and
enjoying
it
once
the
weather
starts
to
take
a
turn
and
feel
more
fallish
its
got
a
really
nice
earthy
flavor
that
goes
down
all
too
easy
o
nice
representation
of
the
style
with
the
hops
being
a
welcome
twist
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
nice
finish
mildly
bitter
really
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
the
munich
malt
comes
through
nice
on
the
finish
and
midpalate
overall
not
a
bad
marzen
the
toastiness
is
a
little
more
than
youll
get
from
most
marzens
and
its
not
as
rich
as
most
a
good
beer
though
between
this
and
great
lakes
oktobefest
theres
no
need
to
look
elsewhere
for
your
next
märzen
fix
probably
the
4rth
or
5th
best
american
okt
ive
had
the
draft
version
was
pretty
much
the
same
a
good
octoberfest
thats
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
o
very
drinkable
refreshing
great
beer
for
the
fall
in
the
end
the
hops
round
everything
out
and
really
balance
out
that
roasted
flavor
the
malts
really
seem
to
be
roasted
closer
to
burnt
but
not
really
it
does
add
for
a
very
autumn
like
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
season
exceptionally
well
crafted
o
i
enjoy
many
of
victories
beers
and
this
one
does
fail
i
bought
a
case
for
my
friends
and
i
know
they
will
enjoy
this
victory

the

as
well
this
beer
has
a
good
level

carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
toastedroasted
malt
quality
to
it
this
german
style
is
undertaken
very
well
by
victory
why
am
i
not
surprised
the
color
is
a
radiant
amber
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
smallish
white
head
the
nose
is
bit
toasty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
the
ghost
of
autumnal
spice
the
flavor
has
a
strong
nuttiness
tending
towards
almond
and
is
smoothed
out
by
notes
of
biscuits
and
toffee
and
yet
it
does
not
cross
the
line
into
sweetness
mediumbodied
and
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
everything
about
it
is
welldone
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
cannot
recall
a
better
oktoberfest
brew
overall
it
is
a
good
tasting
ofest
i
just
think
the
after
taste
lasted
way
too
long
good
beer
if
im
only
having
1
may
become
too
much
if
having
a
sixer
at
a
time
in
all
honesty
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
tasted
it
has
much
more
flavor
than
a
majority
of
the
american
brewed
and
even
some
german
brewed
ones
with
no
off
flavors
easily
one
beer
i
will
be
stocking
the
fridge
full
of
this
fall
o
another
great
beer
from
victory
not
my
absolute
favorite
marzen
but
one
im
happy
to
have
around
when
things
are
cooling
off
im
sure
to
buy
some
more
of
this
o
i
dug
victorys
taste
profile
and
honestly
believe
that
they
are
some
of
the
best
in
the
biz
at
styles
like
this
moonglow
is
a
wow
beer
but
i
simple
thought
this
was
too
rich
for
my
taste
still
this
was
pretty
good
overall
i
always
like
this
beer
not
sure
what
took
so
long
to
review
but
definitely
one
of
the
best
octoberfests
out

poured

a
12oz

find
that

beer
in

is
quite
drinkablei
think
that
it
is
pretty

the
idea
of
a
fest
beer
and
overall
this
beer
is
good
among
other
beers
within

o
i
really
like
this
beer
easy
drinking
and
quality
all
around
one
of
the
best
marzens
ive
had
so
far
this
season
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
despite
all
of
the
maltiness
because
the
hops
help
to
balance
off
the
associated
sweetness
d
nice
example
of
the
style
but
not
great
it
has
decent
drinkability
and
is
worth
a
try
during
the
fall
season
a
truly
well
put
together
and
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
beer
i
will
keep
coming
back
to
as
the

change

and
makes
for
good
drinking
this
is
a
nice
octoberfest
and
perfect
beer
to
go
with
the
season
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
a
very
satisfying
flavor
this
is
my
first

with

is

i

the

its
very

has
some
very

really
like
this
brew
it
is
a
low

flavorful
brew
that
is
light
enough
for
warm
autumn
days
yet
rich
enough
to
satisfy
once

positive
or

this

is
rather
average
at
best
overall
for
a
german
marzenoctoberfest
style
session
lager
this
is
a
very
good
beer
crafted
and
a
great
goto
beer
when
one
doesnt
crave
crazy
tastes
but
just
want
to
relax
with
a
beer
or
several
victory
makes
another
finely
crafted
beer
for
its
style
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
mouthfeel
has
the
makings
of
a
good
sessions
beer
worth
a
try
o
i
could
easily
make
this
my
goto
beer
and
regret
that
the
massproduced
stuff
cant
be
on
this
beers
level
its
very
drinkable
the
more
you
drink
of
it
the
more
it
grows
on
you
still
its
clearly
missing
something
just
a
little
more
girth
to
the
body
and
victory
has
a
perfect
beer
d
well
crafted
i
will
stock
up
on
the
beer
every
fall
as
oktoberfests
tend
to
be
my
favorite
style
not
overly
anything
in
the
flavor
but
certainly
maltier
than
hoppier
surprisingly
i
pick
up
a
note
of
booze
in
the
flavor
right
after
a
dose
of
unexciting
malts
and
a
small
hit
of
hops
that
balances
it
out
and
gives
it
a
little
character
but
its
ultimately
not
enough
to
bring
it
to
victory
standards
its
smooth
and
goes
down
super
easy
but
its
also
unexciting
and
unique
like
i
have
come
to
expect
with
victory
i
definitely
need
to
try
it
again
next
fall
just
to
compare
and
see
how
much
freshness
makes
a
difference
victory
festbier
is
a
hazy
amber
lager
with
some
small
particles
in
it
its
topped
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
malty
and
melanoidal
aroma
it
smells
like
pretzels
grainy
with
a
touch
of
caramel
its
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
with
a
light
quick
finish
it
leaves
the
palate
clean
it
has
a
mellow
flavor
thats
well
blended
it
tastes
grainy
and
fruity
with
notes
of
pretzels
bread
crust
caramel
possibly
a
hint
of
cherry
its
not
sweet
and
has
just
a
touch
of
herbal
bitterness
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
really
well
made
i
like
that
fact
that
they
wanted
to
create
something
for
the
oktoberfest
season
but
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
really
fits
that
perspective
or
not
its
more
along
the
lines
of
a
pilsner
than
a
marzen
the
flavors
that
victory
came
up
with
her
are
most
definitely
german
but
i
dont
think
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
go
in
making
this
brew
it
was
also
a
little
too
weak
for
a
beer
in
the
fall
season
the
beer
quaffs
easily
far
better
than
many
other
american
attempts
at
the
style
its
flavor
profile
is
simple
appropriate
for
a
marzen
but
an
interesting
buttery
tone
reveals
itself
as
it
warms
tasty
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
these
next
fall
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
color
is
amber
with
a
thin
and
quickly
vanishing
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
light
some
caramel
maybe
nutty
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
palate
very
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
a
little
to
watery
and
carbonated
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
malt
and
light
spice
nothing
that
leaves
much
of
an
impression
overall
this
is
not
a
very
complex
beer
however
is
is
very
easy
drinking
and
pretty
cheap
d
very
drinkablbe
and
would
go
with
some
grilled
pork
or
brat
nicely
overall
festbier
is
a
malty
buttered
bread
experience
that
spoils
my
appetite
especially
during
a
big
octoberfest
celebration
where
you
are
encouraged
to
drink
a
few
rounds
i
am
however
tasting
this
offering
on
the
later
end
of
its
lifespan
so
it
is
very
likely
the
hop
flavor
has
subsided
thus
creating
an
imbalance
d
very
enjoyable
and
festive
beer
would
like
to
enjoy
more
in
the
future
d
overall
victory
festbier
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
style
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
fallwinter
season
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
love
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
d
would
be
quite
high
if
it
werent
for
the
metallic
finish
im
experiencing
notes
a
good
marzen
to
pick
up
and
a
rather
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
cheers
drink
another
beer
that
falls
in
the
category
of
not
for
me
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
it
reminded
me
too
much
of
a
barnyard
smell
this
said
i
could
envision
myself
drinking
it
year
round
prosit
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
crisp
carbonation
the
finish
is
quite
dry
making
it
easy
to
come
back
to
and
finish
there
just
wasnt
too
much
to
remember
in
this
one
not
victorys
best
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
or
retention
bready
aroma
with
hints
on
dark
fruit
and
caramel
doughy
flavor
to
start
sweet
bread
grain
yeast
along
with
the
typical
oktoberfest
caramel
and
toffee
malt
toffee
a
little
stronger
than
in
most
very
sweet
finish
the
color
is
a
dark
mahogany
looking
richly
malty
and
inviting
but
wheres
the
head
herr
victory
brewer
the
malt
content
in
the
aroma
and
taste
comes
off
toastedgrainy
nicely
sweet
and
yet
a
tad
syrupy
however
somethings
lacking
a
certain
something
that
fails
to
round
out
the
flavor
to
its
full
potential
throw
in
some
mustiness
up
front
and
vague
cabbage
greens
in
the
back
and
that
sums
up
the
taste
compared
to
the
others
the
body
is
fuller
touching
on
viscous
in
its
smoothness
yet
it
finishes
dry
enough
not
to
stick
i
cant
help
but
feel
this
would
go
well
with
dishes
that
include
potato
german
red
potato
salad
potato
cakes
things
like
that
notes
solid
all
around
toasted
malt
sweetness
creamy
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
im
going
to
miss
this
seasons
oktoberfests
come
winter
d
i
found
this
one
to
be
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
of
the
season
d
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
very
satisfying
very
malty
but
not
very
flavorful
however
you
could
session
this
quite
easy
and
would
be
appealing
for
some
entry
level
drinkers
for
sure
would
try
this
one
again
for
sure
not
a
complete
bust
for
me
d
a
nice
solid
oktoberfest
well
balanced
this
beer
has
a
great
sweet
flavor
that
smacks
you
during
the
first
sip
flavor
is
very
nice
and
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
at
all
finishes
clean
witha
nice
body
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
excellent
octoberfest
it
was
almost
a
given
that
victory
which
has
a
german
beer
sensibility
for
the
most
part
would
hit
a
home
run
with
their
oktoberfest
festbier
is
a
wonderful
celebration
of
the
harvest
season
those
of
you
fortunate
enough
to
live
within
easy
driving
distance
of
dowingtown
can
enjoy
it
yearround
ontap
this
is
such
a
hard
beer
to
review
the
aroma
and
taste
bready
and
malty
is
so
muted
and
mild
but
its
very
true
to
style
an
authentic
octoberfest
is
just
not
going
to
blow
you
away
with
strong
flavors
and
this
doesnt
do
it
either
i
found
the
carbonation
too
thin
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
for
me
that
put
festbier
a
notch
below
the
average
ofest
md
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
i
have
had
festbier
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
release
i
think
it
performs
alright
for
a
style
thats
simple
and
straight
forward
my
only
complaint
about
is
that
the
flavor
seems
to
trail
off
to
a
weak
finish
i
dont
know
what
it
needs
to
carry
it
through
maybe
more
hops
all
in
all
its
a
good
release
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
brew
smooth
and
sessionable
the
aroma
is
malty
and
smooth
with
just
a
little
bit
of
roasted
character
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
it
is
very
smooth
clean
mild
and
malty
carbonation
is
moderate
and
pleasant
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
nofrills
oktoberfest
i
hope
that
my
general
dislike
for
malty
lowhopped
beers
didnt
just
taint
my
experience
of
this
beer
but
i
did
not
really
enjoy
victorys
festbier
very
much
the
beer
looked
okay
it
was
a
clear
russet
brown
with
very
little
head
that
completely
vanished
within
a
minute
the
smell
was
intensely
maltytoasty
and
grainy
the
beer
tasted
just
like
this
very
malty
a
little
sweet
some
grain
astringency
and
a
weird
herbaceous
hop
aftertaste
there
is
a
little
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
spiciness
and
a
raw
walnut
nuttiness
the
beer
is
definitely
undercarbonated
and
feels
a
little
thin
good
pour
copper

with
a
a
good
head
although
it
dissipated
quickly
caramel
and
malty
notes
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
though
as
the
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
was
out
of
wack
and
left
a
slightly
astringent
finish
d
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
playing
horseshoes
on
a
nice
fall
day
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
a
clear
honey
amber
color
with
about
three
fingers
of
rocky
off
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
all
along
the
smell
is
full
of
toasted
malt
a
touch
of
honey
and
bitter
hops
the
taste
follows
to
be
a
big
grainy
and
very
earthy
the
toasted
malts
are
very
predominant
in
the
one
and
the
beer
has
a
slight
honey
sweetness
to
it
however
the
grainy
taste
is
a
bit
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
somewhat
watery
no
complaints
on
the
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
could
see
myself
having
this
around
md
lighter
body
with
nice
carbonation
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
thought
the
beer
was
smooth
with
a
light
creaminess
to
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
an
excellent
brewer
and
to
be
honest
i
thought
that
it
would
have
a
better
rating
than
it
does
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
drinkability
another
solid
brew
from
victory
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
during
the
season
drinkability
a
nice
and
complex
marzen
very
good
for
the
style
i
could
have
several
of
these
reddish
copper
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
light
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
nice
cap
sweet
malty
aromas
with
hints
of
caramel
and
ripe
apple
medium
to
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
sweet
malty
flavors
in
the
beginning
with
a
slightly
tangyspicey
flavor
in
the
middle
that
leadsto
a
nutty
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
dont
get
me
wrong
i
dont
hate
this
ber
its
just
not
a
stand
out
brew
that
i
can
rave
about
d
a
pretty
drinkable
american
marzen
lager
where
malts
are
truly
the
showcase
the
5
6
abv
is
very
manageable
and
although
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
or
balance
to
be
an
elite
oktoberfest
its
a
pretty
strong
option
pair
it
with
a
beer
brat
or
some
potato
salad
and
youre
set
this
is
a
winner
of
an
oktoberfest
for
me
love
the
malt
sweetness
love
the
nutty
flavors
and
i
love
how
it
wraps
up
well
very
clean
and
smooth
goes
down
very
easily
a
pretty
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
drink
a
pretty
classic
representation
of
the
style
festbier
goes
down
easy
and
combines
perfect
measures
of
european
hops
and
sweet
german
malts
who
needs
munich
really
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
as
i
can
remember
drinking
it
quite
often
my
boi
vdubb86
tipped
me
off
to
the
quality
of
this
brew
so
i
gave
it
a
chance
in
my
mixed
sixer
from
dicarlos
it
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
very
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
clove
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
orange
in
the
back
the
taste
ups
the
oranges
ante
slightly
diluting
the
sweeter
notes
but
the
caramel
maintains
itself
nicely
making
up
for
some
of
the
oncelost
ground
the
body
is
a
nearlyheavy
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
ofest
proof
that
mike
aint
completely
crazy
just
yet
d
i
really
liked
this
festbier
it
gave
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
i
kept
the
local
brewed
aspect
in
mind
when
enjoying
it
if
victory
had
this
in
a
variety
case
i
would
not
be
disappointed
not
all
ofest
beers
are
created
equal
and
victory
fstbier
is
one
of
the
better
domestic
examples
ive
had
this
is
one
to
try
during
the
fall
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
size
head
that
stayed
throughout
the
beer
has
a
sweet
complex
smell
similar
to
a
marzen
style
there
is
an
earthy
taste
and
its
a
bit
light
but
still
enjoayble
the
taste
dose
get
old
a
little
too
quick
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
ockotberfest
drinkability
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
it
has
everything
to
expect
in
the
märzen
style
and
the
progression
of
the
experience
is
spoton
if
they
could
make
this
with
a
slightly
higher
abv
and
maintain
the
same
consistency
it
would
have
put
it
over
the
top
pours
a
medium
amber
with
quickly
disappearing
quarter
inch

with
no
lacing
faint
malty
aroma
very
good
burst
of
rich
malt

with
some
balancing

smooth

medium

i
can
quaff
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
nice
example
of
style
but
at
almost
10sixer
im
not
running
out
to
stock
up
id
like
to
catch
this
on
draft
d
mostly
fits
with
the
style
but
is
not
my
favorite
due
to
the
cooked
grain
flavor
i
was
going
to
grab
a
keg
of
sams
octoberfest
but
they
were
out
and
this
is
i
was
recommended
good
choice
copper
color
with
an
amazing
head
extremely
flavorful
october
beer
that
had
a
wonderful
malty
finish
bravo
to
victory
on
this
amazing
october
beer
which
made
me
come
back
for
multiple
rounds
finger
of
deep
tan
foam
with
a
mild
orange
tint
loose
and
bubbly
weak

does
a

theres
a
strong

carbonation
to
it
which
keeps
it
moving
at
a
brisk
pace
not
that
sweet
seems
closer
to
the
traditional
märzen
recipe
with
grain
pumpernickel
bread
corn
husk
walnuts
and
chestnuts
white
pepper

in
the
nose
subdued
orange
citrus
as
well
as
peach
pear
yellow
apple
fruit
thin
patina
of

chocolate
and
caramel
overall
its
a
nice
little
brew
but
not
really
that
interesting
not
as
richly
flavored
as
the
scent
intimates
clean
and
caramelly
with
a
refined
bittering
finish
good
toasting
spicy
hopsmake
it
kinda
refreshing
actually
i
was
first
tempted
to
express
dissatisfaction
with
the
body
its
solid
but
i
dig
it
for
style
the
body
is
about
even
maybe
a
bit
thicker
than
water
very
easy
to
pound
ill
be
getting
more
of
these
as
we
approach
oktoberfest
season
overall
one
is
enough
for
me
not
one
of
my
favorite
fest
brews
ever
by
any
means
i
hate
to
slam
a
beer
but
this
one
just
misses
the
mark
completely
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
overall
its
good
that
these
fall
beers
are
starting
to
come
out
more
now
and
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
its
getting
me
in
the
autumn
state
of
mind
give
me
a
bit
more
aroma
and
a
little
more
in
the
flavor
department
and
this
would
be
a
pretty
nice
beer
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
really
easy
level
of
dryness
and
hops
keeps
you
able
drink
and
want
more
not
my
favorite
october
of
year
but
decent
example
of
the
style
that
wasnt
hard
to
finish
the
6er
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
sturdy
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
doughy
bread
with
some
night
light
fruit
and
caramel
touches
to
it
taste
is
similar
with
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
coming
through
i
really
like
the
balance
theyve
struck
between
the
flavors
as
well
as
the
overall
intensity
mouthfeel
is
nice
creamy
and
rich
without
being
filling
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
believe
this
is
my
favorite
american
version
of
the
style
to
date
d
victory
always
impresses
with
very
authentic
german
style
brews
a
terrific
amount
of
flavor

a

i

sitting
around
with
friends
on

day
on
the
deck
drinking
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
seek
it
out
and
try
one
on
for
yourself
o
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
orange
with
a

of
foam
that
slowly

the
aroma
is
of

along
with
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
of
german
malt
and
slight
german
hop
taste
on

tongue
there
is
also
taste
of
white
grapes
and
orange
there
is
a
medium
body
to
it
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
could
seriously
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
im
thinking
that
this
maybe
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
out
there
but
i
wonder
if
that
is
due
to
the
fact
that
its
on
tap
and
not
out
of
the
bottle
either
way
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
it
somewhat
filling
but
nicely
drinkable
i
could
definitely
put
back
a
couple
more
of
these
with
the
wonderful
soft
pretzels
they
have
here
at
the
brewery
a
very
solid
domestically
brewed
marzen
it
finishes
still
lightly
sweet
but
dries
quite
a
bit
some
lingering
syrupy
flavors
with
more
toasty
and
bready
malt
lingering
as
well
as
some
crisp
lager
flavors
now
more
of
the
bitterness
comes
through
with
some
light
earthy
and
mild
grassy
hop
flavors
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
head
big
toasty
aromas
are
dominant
with
interesting
background
notes
of
tootsie
rolls
and
light
earthiness
flavors
are
more
complex
than
the
nose
with
tons
of
toast
up
front
with
lighter
breadier
and
biscuity
notes
adding
more
layers
to
the
mix
finishes
with
a
blend
of
toast
and
earth
body
is
finely
carbonated
full
bodied
and
rounder
than
many
other
marzens
very
nice
pours
a
very
deep
rich
dark
orange
color
with
a
just
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
traces
of
lacing
pretty
big
does
of
peanut
shells
almonds
and
even
some
roasted
chestnuts
has
a
deep
malted
aroma
taste
is
full
bodied
a
little
to
big
for
an
oktoberfest
but
delicious
this
is
really
a
mix
between
an
irish
red
and
an
oktoberfest
to
me
the
malt
profile
is
nice
and
drinks
very
smooth
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
great
balance
but
predominantly
malty
the
drinkabilitys
huge
big
ass
malt
profile
with
a
nice
complexity
not
usually
found
in
oktoberfest
a
nice
offering
and
a
recommended
version
of
the
style
for
someone
who
wants
a
sixpack
of
fresh
octoberfest
beer
cheers
d
a
decent
beer
mostly
bready
and
caramel
malts
would
drink
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
i
love
hoppy
beers
but
fall
with
its
advent
of
malty
oktoberfest
style
beers
is
my
favorite
season
victory
festbier
will
definitely
be
one
of
my
mainstay
festbiers
this
year
drinkability
i
knew
victory
could
deliver
a
solid
marzen
but
this
was
better
than
expected
similar
to
paulaner
but
better
executed
or
perhaps
simply
fresher
i
think
victory
is
at
the
top
of
their
game
when
they
make
german
beers
prima
pils
festbier
moonglow
weizenbock
are
all
awesome
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
their
other
stuff
too
but
theres
just
something
really
special
about
those
beers
if
you
blindfolded
me
id
probably
think
this
was
a
paulaner
i
actually
think
its
better
but
thats
the
closest
comparison
i
could
get
get
one
a
great
fall
beer
a
must
have
fest
beer
terrific
this
is
my
new
go
to
for
the
style
good
brew
easy
to
drink
fairly
simple
not
something
that
stands
out
but
very
tasty
worth
drinking
and
a
good
seasonal
to
remember
to
look
for
poured
from
a
bottle
pours
amberish
copper
color
with
a
copious
amount
of
carbonated
bubbles
coming
to
the
top
about
2
inches
of
off
white
head
strong
aroma
of
malts
sweet
malts
of
a
caramel
nature
substantial
hop
backbone
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
it
each
year
i
normally
end
up
buy
a
couple
cases
and
just
a
side
not
i
have
drank
it
well
into
march
and
it
was
fine
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
certainly
not
the
greatest
but
definitely
better
than
some
other
examples
ive
seen
it
would
work
well
on
a
day
colder
than
this
though
this
is
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
great
flavor
and
aroma
with
an
amazing
feel
to
it
d
though
im
sipping
now
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
a
beer
to
gulp
as
in
during
oktoberfest
when
the
harvest
is
good
you
have
to
celebrate
somehow
right
d
this
style
is
designed
for
heavy
consumption
and
this
might
be
my
favorite
rendition
of
that
style
perhaps
a
little
sweet
and
less
carbonated
than
others
but
a
great
fest
beer
nonetheless
d
not
bad
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
d
a
decent
drinker
overall
easy
drinking
pretty
much
to
style
and
flavorful
enough
but
not
exceptional
or
memorable
taste
definitely
a
lager
malts
are
toasted
a
little
carmel
and
a
grassy
hop
on
the
palate
finishes
dry
and
would
have
been
good
with
some
bready
food
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
serving
type
12oz
bottle
purchased
nonrefrigerated
on
1272009
d
this
was
a
nice
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
bit
more
hops
than
expected
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
perhaps
a
bit
too
bitter
for
traditionalists
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
id
have
no
problem
drinking
these
all
night
this
is
a
heavily
malted
beer
one
of
the
very
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
yet
d
really
really
drinkable
and
sessionable
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
then
again
you
cant
go
wrong
with
victory
i
get
a
case
of
this
every
fall
really
enjoy
it
alas
ive
only
got
one
left
a
go
to
oktoberfest
for
sure
easy
drinking
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
not
shabby
at
all
mouthfeel
is
crisp
just
how
a
lager
should
be
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
with
very
high
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
tasty
however
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
though
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
and
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
any
ordinary
lager
it
was
sweet
malty
and
yeasty
with
no
significance
in
the
flavor
or
feel
it
was
refreshing
however
and
went
very
well
with
pizza
poured
a
clear
brownish
red
with
a
quickly
dying
tan
head
a
strong
roastedbready
malt
smell
along
with
minor
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
a
tad
thin
and
watery
not
too
sweet
or
hoppy
but
more
a
of
dry
toasted
malt
taste
that
leads
to
a
syrupy
dry
finish
although
it
finishes
clean
with
only
a
little
bit
of
crisp
hops
that
tend
to
citric
notes
for
some
reason
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
yet
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
them
it
is
strong
and
a
few
will
set
you
right
wow
this
is
an
amazing
oktoberfest
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
rich
and
smooth
nice
and
sweet
and
toasty
a
nice
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
for
an
overall
smooth
and
super
drinkable
brew
great
ofest
actually
best
ive
had
more
hops
and
malts
than
the
spaten
or
any
imports
ive
treid
if
youre
into
the
style
its
worth
a
try
notes
this
beer
was
very
interesting
and
surprising
the
malt
was
octoberfest
all
the
way
but
the
hops
were
crisp
snappy
german
pilsner
and
they
made
for
a
very
tasty
combination
drinkability
high
some
of
the
keg
is
still
left
but
not
because
it
filled
us
up
this
was
a
more
sessionable
octoberfest
than
i
had
expected
enjoyed
this
one
good
to
have
a
few
of
drinkable
best
marzen
no
but
its
a
good
one
id
buy
more
decent
feel
maybe
a
little
thin
prickly
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finish
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
very
nice
to
drink
in
the
fall
season
has
a
nice
warming
effect
that
you
dont
get
from
some
oktoberfests
pretty
good
session
beer
for
the
season
d
very
drinkable
could
be
a
session
beer
for
some
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
or
a
little
rich
for
some
to
be
a
session
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
it
tastes
grounded
and
earthy
but
also
a
bit
cheap
looks
a
little
lifeless
too
there
are
better
marzens
overall
a
nice
ofest
that
i
would
drink
anytime
well
done
d
a
nice
brew
once
my
palate
likened
to
it
id
have
another
pours
from
the
bottle
a
nice
clear
amber
tea
with
a
puffy
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
to
a
tiny
ring
of
foam
smell
is
of
course
malt
heavy
theres
also
some
hints
of
caramel
and
earthiness
taste
is
nice
and
malty
a
touch
nutty
although
a
tad
thin
theres
some
sweetness
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
hoppiness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
if
a
bit
thin
its
still
satisfying
highly
drinkable
good
oktoberfest
from
victory
mouthfeel
could
use
more
carbonation
but
decent
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
a
tad
high
a
bit
too
prickly
on
the
tongue
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
overall
a
flawed
beer
but
not
deeply
so
d
a
very
good
marzen
with
a
big
punch
of
maltiness
and
a
big
body
for
the
style
ive
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
victory
another
very
good
brew
i
enjoyed
this
although
i
pretty
much
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
festy
is
a
bit
different
if
only
for
the
way
the
hops
gently
come
out
to
play
in
most
marzens
i
really
only
get
big
malt
globs
i
would
gladly
enjoy
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
sitting
with
the
low
abv
but
12
way
through
i
probably
would
be
looking
for
a
new
style
to
tackle
ive
yet
to
find
a
oktoberfest
that
could
hold
my
interest
either
way
this
is
good
for
a
go
victory
festbier
is
likely
to
appeal
as
much
if
not
more
to
the
mainstream
crowd
as
it
is
to
craft
aficionados
given
its
lighter
body
and
lighter
flavour
it
might
also
go
over
well
with
those
looking
to
celebrate
oktoberfest
in
the
stereotypically
gluttonous
and
overindulgent
fashion
as
for
me
ill
likely
celebrate
it
responsibly
and
with
a
different
beer
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
very
fresh
and
refreshingly
crispclean
a
highly
sessionable
oktoberfest
beer
overall
a
nice
marzen
particularly
for
one
made
in
america
a
good
choice
for
the
marzen
fan
during
the
fall
good
brew
the
mouth
on
this
one
is
a
bit
harsh
this
is
way
overly
carbonated
hinders
drinkability
a
bit
fresh
slight
hoppy
bite
at
the
onset
but
this
finishes
mellow
and
slightly
sweet
i
really
like
the
aftertaste
on
this
nice
bready
flavor
going
on
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
here
just
a
solid
take
on
an
ofest
by
victory
of
all
the
times
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
over
the
last
few
years
i
believe
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
ive
had
it
on
draft
im
glad
that
i
did
theres
a
medium
body
that
almost
seems
fuller
than
it
is
this
one
feels
creamy
but
has
a
very
nice
crispness
with
a
light
carbonation
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
offering
from
the
local
victory
this
one
comes
across
sweet
at
first
but
leaves
you
with
a
nice
hoppy
ending
nothing
too
strong
but
a
perfect
session
beer
for
a
session
beer
style
great
oktoberfest
brew
overall
very
pleasant
ofest
bier
very
welcoming
to
the
season
just
looking
for
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
next
time
drinkability
all
day
a
really
nice
marzen
more
traditional
than
other
american
oktoberfests
but
still
hoppier
than
imports
i
like
the
hops
in
this
adds
some
fruitiness
that
works
well
with
the
maltiness
i
also
like
that
its
not
too
sweet
very
clean
and
very
drinkable
marzen
d
nice
beer
and
could
easily
have
this
one
with
some
brats
and
krat
sitting
in
a
parking
lot
waiting
for
the
game
to
start
poured
from
a
growler
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
slightly
sweet
taste
is
very
easy
drinknig
malty
and
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
selection
im
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
dont
know
why
it
gets
a
low
average
thats
assuming
you
think
a
b
is
low
but
it
is
what
it
is
in
my
opinion
and
mine
is
the
only
one
that
matters
in
my
review
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
fall
session
brew
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
surprisingly
very
full
bodied
and
chewy
especially
for
the
style
with
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
fall
spices
hints
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
biscuit
and
that
slight
toasted
malt
flavor
that
the
aroma
alluded
to
there
is
also
a
very
subtle
hop
presence
which
provided
an
excellent
balance
of
bitterness
to
the
sweet
malts
and
spice
notes
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
but
i
cant
really
see
to
many
germans
liking
it
either
way
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
victory
has
always
produced
quality
beer
and
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
perfect
for
a
cool
autumn
night
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
for
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
a
middle
of
the
road
octoberfest
beer
easy
to
drink
and
always
available
in
this
area
solid
d
the
nutty
character
definitely
leans
this
more
to
an
american
take
on
the
style
but
the
boldness
of
the
smooth
maltiness
throughout
makes
it
a
definite
top
of
the
available
beers
its
wellbalanced
in
all
categories
and
smooth
to
drink
pours
clear
medium
amber
w
a
slight
golden
hue
typical
khaki
head
moderate
retention
and
then
a
film
collar
and
upon
a
moderate
swirl
the
appearance
ofminor
spots
of
lace
dull
malty
nose
pretty
typical
ofest
brew
the
expected
smooth
malt
the
expected
clean
bready
notes
the
expected
easy
to
drink
quality
never
been
my
favorite
style
on
the
dull
side
imho
this
one
fit
my
expectations
works
in
a
marinade
if
you
have
more
of
this
type
of
brew
sitting
around
and
you
are
not
real
interested
in
drinking
more
of
it
beer
has
a
very
bold
rich
autum
color
froty
head
and
numerus
happybubble
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smells
of
clovepumkin
and
spices
very
distinguished
flavors
in
the
taste
carmel
and
harvest
tones
make
this
beer
tasty
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
fast
i
find
this
to
be
a
quaility
beer
victory
usually
produces
excellent
beers
d
i
mean
its
inoffensive
sort
of
and
thin
i
suppose
that
makes
drinkability
but
no
not
really
this
is
a
very
drinkable
octoberfest
very
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
from
a
lager
perspective
i
really
like
it
i
was
expecting
a
different
finish
thinking
there
would
be
more
bite
at
the
end
nothing
like
that
at
all
very
smooth
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
available
all
year
long
tastes
like
toasty
bread
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
a
slight
amount
of
caramel
is
in
there
to
but
this
seems
quite
biscuity
to
me
overall
pretty
good
but
also
a
little
boring
the
good
thing
is
that
is
full
and
not
too
heavy
so
i
could
drink
many
which
is
also
nice
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
biscuits
and
caramel
with
no
real
hop
presence
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
nice
light
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
oktoberfest
i
would
like
to
get
some
more
life
out
of
the
aroma
but
other
than
that
it
is
really
solid
d
good
session
beer
that
feels
right
for
the
season
not
the
best
oktoberfest
around
but
quite
good
poured
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
nice
clean
malty
scent
but
not
very
deep
or
strong
nice
amber
ale
flavor
but
nothing
deep
or
falllike
that
an
oktoberfest
should
have
goes
down
fine
this
would
make
a
slightly
above
average
amber
ale
but
as
far
as
the
deeper
complexities
that
an
oktoberfest
should
have
it
just
wasnt
quite
there
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
a
great
marzen
overall
a
good
brew
d
good
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
oktoberfests
but
this
one
was
good
d
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
d
good
fall
session
beer
in
the
spirit
of
octoberfest
this
is
quite
robust
in
my
opinion
but
still
is
quite
drinkable
will
go
good
with
seasonal
brats
and
pork
highly
recommended
definitely
a
sessionable
one
d
my
initial
reaction
to
this
beer
is
that
it
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
i
like
it
but
it
probably
isnt
my
favorite
octoberfest
beer
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
pretty
easy
drinking
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
octobermarzen
beers
ive
had
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
appropriately
complexbready
and
nutty
with
a
smooth
malty
sweetness
but
overall
the
beer
is
subdued
enough
that
your
palate
never
gets
fried
this
beer
would
pair
great
with
a
lot
of
foods
beyond
that
octoberfest
beer
is
supposed
to
be
eminently
drinkable
and
this
one
has
got
drinkability
in
spades
this
beer
is
so
clean
that
it
exudes
quality
by
its
subtlety
im
gonna
go
broke
this
fall
i
love
good
oktoberfests
and
victorys
version
is
no
exception
very
drinkable
but
caution
a
six
pack
may
not
be
enough
d
overall
a
decent
american
made
octoberfest
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
too
bready
for
my
taste
and
not
enough
sweetness
and
spice
not
bad
but
there
are
better
domestic
marzens
out
there
not
bad
not
great
but
so
far
this
year
of
the
maybe
8
or
so
micro
and
german
okfestsbiers
ive
had
none
have
been
the
shit
poured
and
ok
medium
to
small
off
white
head
and
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
nice
medium
amber
aroma
is
very
nice
malty
and
a
bit
spicy
flavor
is
bout
the
same
bodys
a
tad
thin
sokay
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkable
session
beer
bodys
ok
too
easy
drinking
nice
session
beer
and
big
props
on
the
bottle
artwork
overall
a
slightly
underwhelming
example
of
marzen
but
solid
all
around
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
orange
amber
in
color
the
head
is
about
a
half
an
inch
and
beige
in
color
not
much
lacing
is
left
on
my
glass
the
aroma
malty
and
sweet
some
hops
can
be
detected
but
only
after
a
good
hard
whiff
the
flavor
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
hops
are
there
but
not
real
strong
it
has
a
flowery
finish
the
mouthfell
is
medium
to
light
a
tad
watery
lots
of
carbonation
another
american
marzen
beer
that
i
feel
is
lacking
im
going
to
try
to
stick
to
european
marzens
for
now
on
if
this
keeps
up
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
and
a
nose
that
is
malty
cookie
dough
and
candy
with
a
faint
side
of
hops
apples
and
citrus
fruit
mourthfeel
is
fairly
flat
and
nondescript
and
i
actually
picked
up
the
hoopy
apples
more
than
the
malt
side
in
the
taste
no
alcohol
ever
makes
itself
know
and
the
finish
is
soso
perhaps
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
know
all
i
really
know
is
that
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
brew
i
paid
10
for
a
beer
that
tasted
like
a
yuengling
which
i
couldve
gotten
for
half
the
price
is
it
a
bad
beer
no
its
just
a
beer
that
lacks
concentration
and
leaves
a
mildmannered
impression
hopefully
next
years
will
be
up
to
par
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
golden
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
of
medium
toasted
grains
a
good
dose
of
sweet
malt
grassy
fruity
hops
a
notch
or
two
better
than
medium
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
for
its
style
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
by
all
means
check
it
out
if
you
are
a
fan
somewhat
malty
on
the
tongue
thick
and
simple
with
a
uniform
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
woodsy
spice
rather
bitter
and
smoky
on
the
finish
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
initial
sweetness
carbonation
was
high
and
resulted
in
some
oscillation
between
sweet
and
dry
in
the
second
half
of
the

it

better
drinkability
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
do
several
in
an
evening
one
of
the
nicest
festbiers
ive
tried
not
a
moldbreaking
marzen
by
any
stretch
and
not
the
normal
cutabove
job
achieved
by
victory
still
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
and
i
find
this
to
be
plenty
drinkable
even
a
month
after
its
freshness
date
has
expired
poured
into
a
regular
pint
glass
this
beer
produced
a
amber
hue
with
a
short
lasting
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
smells
like
like
malts
and
perhaps
sugarsomething
sweet
the
carbonation
is
light
but
the
taste
is
not
great
i
felt
like
this
beer
really
goes
outside
of
the
regular
marzen
characterization
unfortunately
this
is
not
a
repeat
for
me
i
have
heard
much
from
victory
but
i
just
dont
get
this
one
i
do
like
the
style
but
this
is
off
a
bit
too
freewheeling
in
the
interpretation
of
festbier
festbier
is
an
aboveaverage
marzen
and
one
of
the
better
american
examples
ive
had
recommended
for
those
of
us
who
cant
afford
a
trip
to
munich
this
is
good
beer
overall
the
taste
experience
is
one
dimensional
form
start
to
finish
a
good
brew
that
is
very
sessionable
not
my
favorite
from
victory
i
prefer
harpoon
octoberfest
to
this
one
because
it
has
a
deeper
malt
flavor
ill
probably
give
this
another
try
next
october
retained
itself
very
well
despite
being
near
the
end
of
shelf
life
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
by
any
stretch
i
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
it
i
just
found
this
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
i
forgot
how
good
it
is
this
particular
one
is
not
the
freshest
victory
festbier
ive
had
as
i
bought
this
in
october
and
its
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
almost
4
months
but
its
still
great
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
i
put
this
one
up
there
with
paulaner
and
spaten
best
american
oktoberfest
ive
had
so
far
obviously
you
probably
wont
be
finding
this
very
easily
right
now
and
perhaps
it
may
be
best
to
wait
for
august
of
this
year
to
try
it
for
the
first
time
sweet
and
malty
crisp
and
clean
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
for
oktoberfest
fans
edit
bottle
was
in
fact
past
its
enjoy
by
date
but
they
must
be
drank
d
the
highlight
perhaps
is
they
are
drinkable
but
whod
want
to
certainly
not
i
this
is
nothing
to
seek
out
but
a
decent
brew
that
hits
the
style
spot
on
the
amber
bodied
beer
was
amply
carbonated
and
readily
formed
a
durable
three
finger
thick
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
slight
hints
of
cooked
corn
the
taste
was
driven
by
honey
dipped
bread
sweetness
of
the
malt
with
some
counter
taste
by
spicy
hops
the
body
was
thicker
than
typical
for
the
style
and
aftertaste
had
a
touch
of
sourness
one
of
the
better
festbiers
ive
had
orange
tinted
amber
with
a
tight
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
after
pouring
smells
of
bready
yeast
and
sweet
maltiness
tastes
very
rich
and
malty
without
being
sweet
something
like
fresh
pumpernickel
with
fresh
butter
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
highly
drinkable
really
nice
probably
the
best
u
s
made
oktoberfest
ive
had
pours
clear
amber
with
a
short
head
pleasant
lager
aroma
sweet
caramel
straw
and
corn
taste
is
watery
and
flat
for
the
style
bread
dough
metal
graham
cracker
and
corn
wanted
more
and
didnt
get
it
i
am
convicnced
that
marzens
and
me
just
do
not
go
together
terrific
drinkability
pleasant
to

a

i

this
the

from

i
have
not

with
the

heavy
on

md
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
not
a
whole

of

but
a
good
beer
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
d
excellent
drinkability
i
would
highly
recommend
that
you
drink
this
offering
from
victory
it
is
delicious
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
medium
to
light
amber
color
with
a
light
beige
head
forming
on
top
that
is
two
inches
thick
then
it
quickly
dissolves
away
to
being
very
feint
appearance
along
the
sides
the
glass
a
strong
maltiness
at
the
front
of
the
aroma
that
is
followed
by
bread
and
biscuit
fragrances
there
is
a
lemon
citrus
scent
in
at
the
end
the
malt
is
very
dominant
right
at
the
front
of
each
taste
there
is
a
very
feint
grassy
bitterness
at
the
end
a
thin
feel
at
the
front
it
gradually
gains
weight
as
flows
across
the
palate
i
am
of
the
believe
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
undrinkable
oktoberfestmarzen
this
beer
fits
that
believe
though
a
littlr
more
hop
character
would
be
nice
to
balance
it
out
better
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
somewhat
zesty
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
or
not
medium
body
malty
and
biscuity
not
a
whole
lot
of
spiciness
or
hoppiness
here
but
the
body
doesnt
stand
out
all
that
well
a
far
thinner
body
than
i
recall
from
my
last
time
tasting
i
never
thought
id
call
a

certainly
not
the
most
complex
of
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
but
it
is
well
worth
seeking
out
for
the
season
recommended
pours
clear
copper
with
a
halfinch
of
tan
head
on
top
and
sparse
lacing
on
the
sides
the
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
between
toasted
caramel
malts
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
more
maltfocused
plenty
of
nutty
and
toasted
bread
malts
with
a
bit
of
clean
bitter
hop
in
the
finish
medium
body
is
both
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
a
little
weak
on
the
hops
but
easydrinking
and
pleasant
for
a
maltlover
pours
copper
with
a
relatively
thin
head
and
little
lacing
smell
is
malty
and
fruity
maybe
cherries
slight
tang
from
the
yeast
on
the
finish
taste
is
smooth
with
dry
malt
noticeable
but
slightly
watery
earthybitterness
in
the
middle
and
a
spicy
finish
not
bad
but
a
little
disjointed
mouthfeeel
is
spritzy
and
spicy
smooth
but
not
creamy
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
whole
package
just
doesnt
make
me
shout
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
good
body
a
rich
version
that
was
a
real
treat
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
is
a
very
decent
example
of
the
style
may
not
be
the
most
outstanding
but
a
good
ol
american
shot
at
the
euro
style
o
very
refreshing
first
had
this
at
victorys
fall
fest
fresh
and
lovely
on
a
warm
fall
day
d
highly
drinkable
beer
it
is
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
down
great
festbier
overall
the
malt
character
is
wonderful
and
it
has
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
head
is
good
for
an
american
beer
but
a
bit
subpar
by
german
standards
and
the
beer
could
be
just
a
little
bit
smoother
but
aside
from
these
minor
flaws
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
festbiers
i
have
had
poured
into
a
tulip
pint
glass
was
a
orangey
redy
browny
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
quickly
left
quickly
with
a
thin
tracing
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
smelt
yeasty
and
sweet
tasted
slightly
acidic
bitter
with
spices
and
pepper
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated

this
one
combines
interesting

with
a
sessionable
feststyle
brew
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
im
actually
disappointed
i
love
victorys
offerings
but
this
one
is
just
weird
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
dont
think
so
though
tastes
kinda
like
dirt
with
a
little
bit
of
old
hops
added
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
the
worst
octoberfest
ive
ever
had
so
far
and
i
really
hate
to
say
it
again
victory
is
a
wonderful
brewery
and
this
is
the
first
of
theirs
that
ive
had
that
i
dont
like
maybe
its
not
me
cause
my
buddy
did
say
hes
tried
it
and
hated
it
as
well
sorry

i
dont
recommend
this

you

a
good
fall
beer
this
brew
was
served
to
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
goodsized
frothy
head
that
had
a
nice
retention
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
musty
with
a
great
deal
of
malt
wrapped
together
some
spiciness
seems
to
be
present
as
well
along
with
a
slight
nut
and
alcohol
scent
breaking
through
over
all
a
pretty
good
smelling
brew
the
taste
to
me
seemed
to
disappoint
it
did
not
seem
to
have
enough
oomph
seemed
watered
down
the
malt
flavors
where
there
but
they
did
not
stick
out
the
flavors
that
where
present
where
caramel
nuts
toasted
grain

finish
not
a

beer
but
do
feel
that
it

up
against
some
of
the

marzens
from
germany

is

number
of

the

comes

out
overall
impression
scott
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
nothing
stands
out
with
this
offering
but
it
seemed
solid
enough
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
its
worth
giving
it
a
try
also
i
expected
more
flavor
out
of
a
beer
from
victory
brewing
company
its
not
a
standout
and
actually
a
small
letdown
coming
from
victory
whom
i
assumed
would
put
out
a
classic
but
to
say
its
anything
less
than
solid
would
sell
it
short
as
this
ultimately
succeeds
in
its
cause
and
would
be
downable
in
minivansized
steins
given
the
right
occasion
and
absence
of
other
similar
options
this
one
poured
a
very
nice
light
orange
amber
with
a
good
looking
two
inch
plus
head
on
the
top
ample
carbonation
was
kept
alive
throughout
which
really
gave
it
great
retention
and
helped
to
keep
the
lively
look
of
it
going
a
nice
bit
of
side
glass
lace
was
apparent
but
the
real
story
here
was
the
complete
and
total
clarity
of
the
color
and
the
great
hue
to
it
overall
a
very
nice
classic
looking
lager
here
i
have
only
tried
two
victory
beers
prima
pils
was
my
first
but
i
like
festbier
a
whole
lot
more
a
great
seasonal
that
should
be
a
year
round
beer
overall
what
can
i
really
say
about
this
one
it
was
really
superb
and
just
what
was
needed
at
the
time
this
was
an
extremely
drinkable
well
designed
and
very
filling
brew
that
really
gave
a
good
represent
of
the
style
and
offered
a
none
complicated
version
in
a
day
and
age
where
everyone
and
everything
keeps
going
better
it
was
nice
to
see
someone
just
keep
it
simple
and
put
out
a
quality
everyday
brew
well
done
pours
light
copper
with
decent
enough
head
and
some
lacing
smells
a
touch
doughy
with
some
soft
caramel
and
hops
upfront
is
a
nice
lightly
toasty
malt
note
that
gives
way
to
a
nice
mellow
malt
base
all
balanced
by
an
even
hop
bitterness
ends
drying
mouthfeel
is
damn
near
perfect
for
an
ofest
i
think
almost
medium
bodied
with
vibrant
carbonation
and
a
terrific
creamyness
without
getting
too
heavy
impeccable
balance
drinkability
is
good
best
ofest
ive
had
this
year
though
ill
admit
to
only
having
tried
5
or
so
extra
points
to
this
one
for
not
being
overdone
overall
a
nice
entry
into
the
marzen
world
overall
a
very
enjoyable
oktoberfest
bright
coppery
orange
with
a
shortlived
head
clean
sweet
malt
aroma
lightly
doughy
and
floral
toasted
nutty
sweet
malts
comprise
much
of
the
flavor
a
leafy
herbal
hoppiness
compliments
the
malt
solid
medium
body
wraps
everything
up
nicely
clean
and
easily
drinkable
its
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
its
good
but
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
more
cheers
decent
the
slightly
burnt
edges
irks
me
a
bit
but
overall
its
decent
enough
to
put
in
the
yearly
lineup
of
ofests
good
yummy
and
satisfying
drinkability
i
could
kick
back
plenty
of
these
bad
larrys
very
drinkable
the
best
american
version
of
oktoberfest
that
i
have
tasted
yet
seems
better
than
last
years
outing
this
is
good
stuff
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
beers
true
to
the
style
dont
leave
much
wiggle
room
for
twists
and
turns
in
the
flavour
but
those
that
can
do
it
right
make
for
a
tasty
beer
and
thats
what
this
one
does
pours
a
perfectly
clear
dark
reddishcopper
color
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
not
very
strong
faint
hop
aromas
underlie
toasted
malts
taste
is
of
toasted
malts
with
only
hints
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
beer
out
some
sweetness
at
the
beginning
gives
way
to
a
drier
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
but
didnt
do
anything
to
impress
me
ill
have
another
but
in
the
future
id
pass
on
this
and
give
myself
the
opportunity
to
try
a
new
beer
another
winner
by
victory
brewing
company
a
nice
mix
of
bread
and
caramel
aftertaste
goes
down
like
spring
water
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
recommend
this
beer
and
will
absolutely
be
buying
this
product
again
i
also
will
be
buying
other
produts
from
victory
brewing
afterall
its
in
my
hometowns
backyard
pours
a
rich
amber
hue
with
a
one
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
stcikiness
is
hardly
there
but
somewhat
smell
is
a
sweet
buttery
scent
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
mixed
in
definitely
a
lot
of
malts
in
this
one
lets
give
it
a
taste
starts
off
with
a
subtle
citrus
hop
bite
that
is
quickly
dominated
by
the
sweet
caramel
malt
sweet
bready
flavor
with
a
nice
kettle
popcorn
flavor
towards
the
end
with
a
vanilla
tea
like
aftertaste
pretty
complex
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
i
put
this
one
down
quicker
than
i
had
expected
pretty
damn
good
i
must
say
victory
seems
to
master
almost
all
styles
of
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dies
quick
smells
crisp
of
nuts
and
spice
with
a
little
vanilla
tastes
as
it
smells
with
a
touch
of
malt
to
balance
out
all
the
mild
flavors
medium
to
light
in
the
mouth
with
tasty
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
as
this
is
a
sessionable
but
not
impressionable
brew
drinkability
make
no
mistake
this
beer
may
not
be
overly
complex
but
it
is
exceedingly
drinkable
in
every
possible
way
in
fact
its
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
ive
had
all
year
only
two
as
of
writing
this
yeah
its
a
good
fest
beer
its
got
a
basic
mostly
sweet
taste
of
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
grassyspicy
hops
at
the
end
the
carbonation
seems
a
touch
low
and
i
cant
get
any
head
or
lacing
theres
a
slight
burnt
or
heavy
roasted
note
in
the
back
of
the
flavor
like
some
black
patent
malt
was
used
id
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
really
seek
it
again
a
pretty
average
oktoberfest
imo
poured
up
nicely
with
an
orange
bronze
colour
and
a
foamy
sand
coloured
head
smell
was
honestly
a
little
bmcish
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
all
pretty
average
overall
this
wasnt
bad
but
honestly
i
wasnt
impressed
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
little
more
hop
finish
would
have
put
this
beer
at
a
5
0
drinkability
is
good
though
good
malty
flavor
a
solid
beer
that
will
go
down
easily
especially
this
weekend
while
camping
out
not
much
going
on
here
and
yet
its
fantastic
i
feel
nourished
i
think
i
could
have
this
for
breakfast
you
know
in
an
emergency
dont
say
you
never
thought
of
it
final
note
a
very
different
taste
than
any
of
the
many
american
or
german
marzens
ive
tasted
fall
beers
are
a
favorite
of
mine
i
like
what
victory
has
brewed
here
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
celebrating
anything
prosit
t
very
nice
and
flavorful
there
is
definatly
caramel
and
malts
with
some
earthy
tones
as
well
i
feel
it
has
a
medium
taste
but
not
such
a
medium
bodied
beer
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
its
almost
like
drinking
a
thinner
drink
with
alot
of
flavor
i
still
think
its
a
great
beer
regardless
thisalso
makes
drinkability
really
high
very
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
i
would
rather
move
forward
from
this
beer
than
drink
it
again
not
bad
simply
not
something
worth
coming
back
to
drinkability
i
like
any
octoberfest
beer
a
must
try
interesting
taste
compared
to
others
drinkabilitynotes
glad
i
found
this
guy
in
the
back
of
my
dbf
just
what
i
was
looking
for
to
offset
all
of
the
big
winter
beers
ive
accumlated
a
nice
malty
beer
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
giving
the
beer
its
sweetness
that
also
finishes
with
a
nice
hoppy
twang
that
lingers
long
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
super
drinkable
and
one
the
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
so
inclined
definitley
recommended
and
will
buy
again
next
fall
im
not
crazy
about
fest
beers
but
maybe
its
right
that
this
stuff
tastes
a
little
muted
that
is
if
it
is
to
be
consumed
all
afternoon
long
from
bottomless
steins
i
think
victory
scores
again
with
this
one
it
may
feel
a
little
delicate
but
its
good
stuff
d
easily
drinkable
no
doubt
a
very
good
session
beer
marzens
are
suppposed
to
be
subtle
and
understated
but
this
one
might
be
too
understated
for
my
tastes
i
have
reccomended
this
to
friends
who
still
drink
bud
lite
etc
in
efforts
to
get
them
to
start
drinking
higher
quality
beers
the
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
war
brewed
to
session
mk
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
yellowishorange
coloring
autumn
appropriate
with
a
nice
head
yet
it
disappeared
quickly
it
gave
off
a
faint
sweet
smell
with
almost
the
hint
of
orange
the
taste
was
smooth
and
refreshing
sweet
and
malty
followed
by
a
mild
hop
aftertaste
it
was
fairly
well
carbonated
and
you
could
feel
the
bubbles
in
your
mouth
as
you
drank
it
overall
a
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
we
served
this
at
our
annual
oktoberfest
family
party
back
in
october
and
it
went
over
real
well
with
an
assortment
of
german
sausages
and
smoked
pork
chops
12
oz
bottle
enjoy
by

it
pours
a
clear
copperamber
with
high
carbonation
leading
up
to
a
halfinch
khaki
head
that
keeps
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
light
lacing
it
smells
sweetish
with
toasted
and
caramel
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
lightly
toasted
with
caramel
molasses
and
some
lightly
spicy
green
hops
that
leave
a
medium
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
lightly
drying
tingly
at
first
but
it
evens
out
and
leaves
a
medium
finish
another
good
offering
from
victory
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
creaminess
flows
down
really
easily
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
brew
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
to
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
no
problem
another
solid
brew
from
victory
and
quite
possibly
my
last
ofest
of
the
year
12oz

poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
very
little
head
not
much
in
the
smell
department
but
a
bit
of
malt
taste
of
bready
malts
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
ive
tried
this
year
and
will
look
forward
to
it
in
the
next
year
drinkability
is
great
really
smooth
and
easy
drinking
thanks
jay
an
interesting
take
on
a
marzen
auburn
colored
brew
a
bit
darker
than
traditional
german
ofest
aroma
is
bready
but
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
good
bread
and
malt
conquer
the
hops
on
this
one
for
sure
nice
mouthfeel
fullish
drinkability
is
good
this
one
rivals
the
best
usa
ofests
not
quite
as
balanced
as
this
years
brooklyn
ofest
though
im
glad
i
can
get
this
one
in
ct
although
the
supply
was
very
limited

nice
its
funny
how
one
of
the
few
true
american
octoberfests
is
called
a
festbier
anyway
a
nice
example
of
an
octoberfest
very
true
to
the
german
style
one
of
the
best
american
octoberfests
out
there
d
definitely
one
you
can
quaff
down
to
celebrate
oktoberfest
nice
drinkability
a
very
good
session
beer
which
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
nice
balance
and
good
taste
light
copper
color
with
a
small
peach
colored
head
smelled
of
malt
and
something
sweet
like
honey
possibly
mild
hints
of
spice
as
well
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
with
a
light
and
refreshing
feel
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
low
abv
and
very
watery
consistency
as
far
as
compared
to
other
brews
of
this
style
it
is
not
the
best
but
worth
a
try
copper
color
with
an
oatmeal
colored
thick
and
foamy
head
that
fills
the
top
of
the
glass
an
inch
high
and
lingers
long
very
low
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
some
sweet
fruit
mostly
apple
flavor
is
biscuity
malt
some
caramel
and
an
autumnal
smokey
dry
leaves
kind
of
flavor
thats
hard
to
describe
or
decipher
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
tannic
d
it
is
good
but
nothing
amazing
is
nice
and
refreshing
a
easy
beer
to
drink
but
not
one
to
go
nuts
over
this
is
the
most
plain
jane
brew
ive
had
from
victory
but
its
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
a
bmc
drinker
into
craft
beer
i
think
d
the
flavor
of
this
beer
are
good
but
a
bit
muted
making
it
a
little
thin
and
not
that
exciting
for
a
session
beer
thie
is
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
would
expect
form
victory
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
is
great
this
would
be
an
ideal
companion
for
a
cool
autumn
day
i
only
wish
i
wouldve
purchased
more
of
these
ahhh
finally
a
great
american
oktoberfest
this
one
is
really
good
highly
malty
with
some
stickiness
on
the
glass
leaving
some
slight
lacing
not
much
head
after
the
pour
caramel
notes
all
over
with
a
nice
slight
hoppy
twinge
at
the
end
nice
burnt
orange
in
color
a
highly
recommended
beer
and
decently
priced
i
say
it
rivals
paulaner
and
ayinger
as
my
top
3
a
solid
marzen
from
victory
that
captures
all
of
the
beauty
of
this
seasonal
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
very
sessionable
d
very
good
representation
of
style
tasty
not
very
filling
for
this
style
easy
to
drink
i
could
stick
with
this
one
for
the
duration
of
an
evening
clear
bright
toasty
amber
color
with
a
thin
grayishwhite
layer
of
foam
spicy
yet
smooth
aromas
of
noble
hops
somehow
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
scotch
magic
tape
backed
up
by
some
doughy
malt
scents
like
a
loaf
rising
in
a
slightly
warm
oven
there
is
but
a
flash
of
grassy
and
spicy
hop
flavor
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
here
is
almost
entirely
about
bready
malts
with
a
very
faint
caramel
note
appearing
before
a
mildly
spicy
hop
finish
a
chewy
bread
flavor
lingers
in
a
most
unhurried
fashion
through
the
aftertaste
there
is
moderate
carbonation
here
but
its
felt
only
at
the
finish
and
is
rather
appropriate
overall
clean
lager
mouthfeel
gets
a
bit
heavy
as
it
warms
i
appreciate
that
the
alcohol
is
not
overly
ampedup
in
this
maerzen
unlike
many
other
american
interpretations
i
tried
this
on
tap
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
didnt
review
it
but
i
seem
to
remember
liking
it
far
less
than
this
bottle
interesting
anyway
a
solid
drinkable
beer
for
the
beginning
of
the
cooler
months
recommended
d
im
not
a
huge
lager
drinker
but
this
is
a
really
pleasant
beer
balanced
flavorful
and
well
done
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
overall
much
better
2nd
time
around
a
good
session
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
went
down
so
easy
it
was
gone
before
i
even
finished
my
review
d
i
love
this
time
of
yearso
many
highly
drinkable
ofests
ive
been
particularly
impressed
with
the
american
offerings
this
year
and
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
a
decent
attempt
at
an
octoberfest
marzen
i
liked
the
variation
of
the
theme
with
the
hop
presence
but
i
think
it
lends
itself
to
more
criticism
from
the
style
police
it
is
still
pretty
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
a
hackerpschorr
or
paulaner
i
will
go
back
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
copper
thin
whitenot
much
retention
just
a
bit
of
lacing
but
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
malty
but
week
body
is
light
to
medium
and
carbonated
taste
trys
to
balance
malt
and
hops
and
just
about
makes
it
worth
a
try
but
dont
run
out
and
buy
its
a
slightly
above
average
beer
that
should
be
the
handsdown
best
of
its
style
to
justify
the
extravagant
price
of
10sixer
crisp
and
clean
with
a
lingering
caramel
sweetness
fairly
fullbodied
for
a
lager
i
could
put
down
many
of
these
with
no
problem
ive
really
gotten
into
oktoberfests
this
year
whereas
last
year
i
skipped
over
many
this
is
a
mistake
i
wont
make
in
future
years
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
juicy
and
kind
of
reminds
me
of
red
apples
which
is
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
theres
some
hops
at
the
end
but
thats
not
where
any
emphasis
lies
its
not
very
complicated
but
the
fruitiness
and
buttery
mouthfeel
make
it
so
drinkable
that
i
just
dont
care
on
my
recent
foray
to
norms
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
with
some
singles
to
taste
as
well
and
im
thinking
that
the
singles
will
have
to
wait
as
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
the
taste
is
definitely
about
the
malt
they
are
fairly
big
nice
and
biscuity
with
carmel
notes
throughout
a
good
amount
of
yeast
overtones
as
well
the
nose
is
confirmed
with
a
slight
hoppiness
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
which
makes
it
enjoyable
i
definetly
recommend
this
for
any
ofest
not
oface
thats
something
else
fans
pairs
well
with
any
of
your
classic
german
fare
cheers
d
try
this
if
you
see
it
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
this
season
so
far
easy
drinkingnot
overly
sweet
or
malty
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
beers
i
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
pours
an
orangishbrown
with
a
2inch
foamy
head
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malt
very
good
blend
of
malt
a
hint
of
citrus
and
sweet
caramel
goes
down
a
little
on
the
thick
side
and
has
a
nice
caramel
aftertaste
very
drinkable
lager
great
for
enjoying
at
night
as
a
dessert
brew
d
very
drinkable
a
well
made
oktoberfestbier
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
not
too
strong
but
it
has
sweet
malt
nuts
and
an
earthy
aroma
the
taste
is
very
chewy
with
nutscarmelsweet
malt
and
a
bisquity
flavor
the
mf
is
light
and
chewy
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
stylesbut
this
is
pretty
good
as
i
would
expect
from
a
brewery
as
good
as
victory
cheers
oelergud
this
is
a
classic
marzen
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
notes
and
faint
hops
aftertaste
but
the
sweet
flavors
predominate
as
they
should
this
beer
is
extremely
creamy
and
smooth
and
marks
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
a
slightly
above
average
marze
reserved
in
flavor
an
offering
a
bit
disappointing
from
what
id
expect
from
victory
drinkability
good
the
pour
into
my
mahrs
mug
raises
a
light
tan
two
finger
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
the
lacing
is
also
quite
sparse
the
beers
color
is
a
lovely
deep
ambercopper
the
nose
is
sweet
bready
and
touched
by
a
hint
of
floral
hops
but
also
has
a
bit
of
a
burnt
aroma
the
taste
is
richer
than
many
ofests
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
i
think
the
burnt
flavor
creeps
in
here
as
well
it
doesnt
ruin
in
but
it
takes
away
from
the
overall
impression
the
other
flavor
aspects
light
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
are
quite
nice
the
mouth
is
right
where
i
want
it
medium
with
medium
carbonation
too
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
ofests
ive
had
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
if
flawed
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
dark
almost
angry
copper
with
a
head
that
rises
fast
and
leaves
almost
as
quickly
leaving
a
skim
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
slightly
nutty
aroma
light
and
sugary
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
then
a
bit
more
brassy
and
full
on
the
edges
its
fruitiness
is
like
an
english
pale
ale
with
an
almost
watery
aftertaste
that
is
actually
very
pleasant
as
with
so
many
oktoberfests
the
only
way
to
make
it
more
drinkable
would
be
to
add
an
intravenous
line
all
in
all
a
terrifically
drinkable
festbier
prost
once
again
a
high
quality
brew
from
a
brewery
that
always
pleases
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
made
in
america
for
once
i
agree
with
the
leftest
sobs
at
the
ny
times
0
now
this
is
the
octoberfest
that
my
palate
has
been
craving
certainly
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
easily
drinkable
i
may
get
burned
out
on
the
style
before
the
season
even
gets
here
as
this
is
the
third
ofest
that
i
have
purchased
and
consumed
in
august
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
at
times
and
im
adding
it
to
my
beerstore
shoppinglist
i
would
find
it
very
acceptable
in
quantity
at
a
party
my
feelings
seem
to
reflect
that
of
others
here
as
well
drinks
easy
like
a
good
lager
does
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
caramel
up
front
with
a
bit
of
bitey
grass
hop
in
the
middle
and
finishes
grainy
the
finish
lingers
for
a
bit
as
well
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
yelloworange
color
with
a
nice
thin
white
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
the
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
bready
nose
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
much
what
you
get
with
the
aroma
a
nice
bit
of
sweet
malts
with
the
earthy
bread
smell
taste
the
taste
does
not
linger
in
the
mouth
for
very
long
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
and
very
drinkable
this
is
another
good
beer
from
victory
brewing
keep
up
the
great
work
taste
pretty
much
follows
its
aroma
it
has
a
solid
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
little
bit
of
the
spiciness
makes
an
appearance
theres
also
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
this
is
not
the
best
ofest
by
any
means
but
its
still
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
this
beer
came
a
dark
burgundy
with
some
orange
highlights
and
no
head
smelled
of
a
smoky
sweet
lager
with
some
pasty
oats
and
a
slight
nip
of
unobtrusive
hops
tasted
of
fruity
raspberries
doughy
and
pasty
oat
malt
with
a
nice
bitter
snap
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
sharp
electric
small
bubbled
carbonation
crisp
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
up
front
with
earthy
hop
spice
backing
it
up
overall
lovely
jubbly

one
of
the
best
us
oktoberfests
that
i
have
sampled
to
date
i
picked
this
bottle
up
whilst
in
pa
last
month
its
a
real
shame
that
this
one
doesnt
come
west
with
the
other
victory
brews
recommended
doesnt
have
the
complexity
and
mouthfeel
of
the
good
to
great
ofests
out
there
average
all
around
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
small
sparse
head
over
top
nose
is
sweet
and
toasty
almost
sugary
sweet
id
like
a
bit
more
of
the
bready
and
toastyness
to
come
through
flavor
is
pretty
nice
fairly
toasty
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
very
very
light
noble
hop
finish
very
clean
nice
american
example
of
the
style
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
pretty
solid
brew
here
tasty
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
malt
with
some
sweetness
and
possibly
a
little
toasted
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
its
comprised
of
caramel
malt
and
some
toastiness
but
theres
a
hop
flavor
in
there
as
well
whatever
hop
it
is
im
not
a
fan
of
its
flavor
not
necessarily
something
off
in
the
beer
i
just
dont
like
this
hop
finish
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
and
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
drinkability
is
ok
drinkable
and
tasty
it
is
special
not
so
much
of
course
not
every
beer
needs
to
be
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
if
i
could
get
this
locally
i
would
drink
it
it
would
be
a
nobrainer
is
this
good
enough
for
me
too
seek
out
in
the
future
no
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
i
am
very
happy
i
could
try
it
thank
you
redhaze
this
victory
seasonal
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
and
toasted
grains
sort
of
weak
taste
is
also
weak
and
watery
for
my
liking
the
flavors
arent
bad
but
theyre
too
weak
a
light
grainy
sweetness
is
prevalent
along
with
some
nondescript
malts
finish
is
fruity
and
sweet
this
beer
is
ok
probably
a
good
session
choice
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
victory
had
it
again
a
bit
more
than
a
year
later
and
noted
sourness
as
well
as
aggressive
carbonation
and
peach
colour
this
festbier
poured
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
aroma
is
a
bit
breadymalty
and
a
very
mild
hint
of
spice
taste
is
upfront
sweet
malt
and
caramel
and
a
slight
dry
finish
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
well
done
drinkability

this
is
a
true
session
bier
and
one
of
the
better
efforts
at
the
style
from
an
american
manufacturer
very
drinkable
beer
here
tasty
and
mild
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
fine
everyday
type
of
beer
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
not
too
sweet
like
some
oktoberfest
a
very
well
crafted
brew
a
decent
marzen
true
to
design
it
would
serve
as
a
good
sessionfestival
beer
as
happens
at
times
the
rather
simple
and
thin
flavor
goes
a
long
way
toward
making
this
quite
quaffable
its
utterly
inoffensive
and
pretty
much
unremarkable
as
well
still
its
well
better
than
just
average
and
it
absolutely
qualifies
as
satisfying
its
not
likely
to
stand
up
well
to
much
but
the
more
mild
food
dishes
but
as
a
standalone
session
beer
it
would
be
nicely
recommended
you
cant
be
amazed
by
every
beer
you
try
but
this
one
impresses
just
enough
to
make
it
desirable
this
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
very
mild
and
malty
taste
is
almost
all
sweet
malt
with
just
a
little
hops
kicking
in
for
the
finish
medium
bodied
maybe
just
a
tiny
bit
thin
but
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
this
beer
this
is
extremely
drinkable
it
really
begs
to
be
drank
in
quantity
this
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
dirty
brass
with
a
small
head
that
finally
falls
to
nothing
nose
is
sweaty
malt
and
some
butter
notes
taste
picks
up
with
a
fine
blend
of
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
for
a
drying
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
it
increases
during
the
taste
very
drinkable
not
bad
at
all
try
it

pours
a
clear
mediumlight
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
with
little
retention
only
a
little
lacing
as
well
the
aroma
is
maltdominant
of
course
without
smelling
too
sweet
and
bready
a
pleasant
nuttiness
to
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
at
first
with
the
malts
coming
off
a
little
on
the
weak
side
the
hops
only
really
make
their
presence
known
toward
the
finish
however
by
the
time
i
got
halfway
through
the
second
bottle
i
was
enjoying
it
more
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
on
the
thin
side
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
have
just
grown
to
expect
more
from
victory
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
ive
had
better
oktoberfests
this
year
and
with
the
higherthanaverage
price
tag
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
victory
festbier
has
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
a
large
pack
of
american
craft
brewers
who
make
oktoberfest
biers
this
isnt
necessarily
meant
as
a
criticism

festbier
is
one
of
many
wellexecuted
versions
of
the
style
that
are
good
but
not
amazing
id
give
the
nod
to
brooklyns
oktoberfest
over
this
but
if
i
found
festbier
on
tap
id
happily
order
a
pint
clear
caramelamber
with
a
short
stand
of
fine
offwhite
bubbles
that
showed
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
malty
aroma
with
some
toasty
caramel
a
slight
smokiness
and
faint
hops
a
malty
caramel
flavoured
brew
the
moderate
bitterness
continued
and
increased
into
the
finish
overall
a
very
clean
grain
flavour
with
some
toastiness
thats
balanced
by
moderate
hop
flavour
very
smooth
texture
medium
carbonation
some
residual
sweetness
and
sugar
clean
malty
and
tasty
an
enjoyable
offering
from
victory
it
pours
a
copper
shade
in
color
with
a
fizzy
poplike
head
that
almost
immediately
dissappears
the
nose
is
packed
with
a
rich
sweet
malty
scent
smells
delicious
the
taste
is
also
malty
but
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
or
maybe
tangyness
towards
the
end
the
sip
finishes
with
an
odd
aftertaste
that
i
just
cant
seem
to
figure
out
the
mouthfeel
is
crappy
maybe
not
terrible
but
too
thin
and
too
fizzy
when
it
first
hits
the
palate
drinkability
is
average
there
are
a
lot
better
octoberfests
out
there
this
one
isnt
terrible
but
it
really
isnt
anything
to
get
excited
about
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
good
fall
session
beer
less
than
6
abv
and
no
overpowering
flavor
or
body
so
as
to
make
this
tough
to
drink
more
than
once
i
could
easily
cozy
up
with
a
sixer
and
call
it
a
night
pours
an
amberorange
color
good
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
mostly
carmely
malts
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
again
mostly
sweet
carmel
malts
with
a
cleansing
and
balancing
hop
finish
carbonation
helps
with
the
clearing
of
the
pallate
clean
beer
all
around
maybe
a
touch
higher
fg
for
me
perhaps
my
fall
season
this
is
the
seission
beer
to
have
im
starting
to
like
and
appreciate
victory
more
and
more
light
mouth
feel
and
is
generously
carbonated
pours
orangish
out
of
the
bottle
thin
white
layer
forms
on
top
less
than
one
finger
head
smell
is
malty
with
some
spices
mixed
in
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
a
stale
taste
not
as
malty
as
other
oktoberfests
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
not
one
of
victorys
better
offerings
d
so
so
easy
the
moutfeel
and
taste
make
this
an
easy
drinker
you
could
only
be
so
lucky
as
to
be
able
to
score
a
minikeg
of
this
as
i
did
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
with
this
offering
though
the
color
is
good
i
found
the
nose
a
little
soft
and
had
to
really
work
it
to
bring
out
the
character
first
sip
didnt
deliver
the
roasted
malt
flavor
i
am
used
to
from
a
oktoberfest
lager
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
nice
fall
beer
well
made
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
know
victory
can
do
better
i
typically
look
for
more
initial
mouthfeel
in
alcohol
and
malt
in
a
fest
beer
the
spice
was
faint
but
there
by
the
end
the
body
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
swet
malts
and
the
carbonation
and
hop
combo
best
okto
ive
had
this
year
could
drink
it
all
night
great
deep
copper
color
but
crystal
clear
not
much
to
speak
of
with
the
head
but
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
gives
it
a
little
life
smell
is
faint
malt
and
some
yeast
bread
tones
taste
is
well
balanced
with
some
nutty
tones
but
mostly
just
basic
malt
without
being
sweet
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
good
carbonation
level
very
drinkable
beer
i
went
through
this
12
oz
very
quickly
the
best
of
the
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
another
solid
offering
from
victory
and
highly
recomended
a
nice
fall
offering
from
victory
poured
out
to
an
orange
color
with
a
nice
14
inch
head
lacing

absent
in
this
brews
presentation
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
malts
and
bread
are
detected
as
is
grain
and
mild
hops
taste
is
robust
yet
smooth
flavors
of
malt
hops
and
minor
spice
are
all
present
with
a
toasted
like
character
filling
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
smooth
while
remaining
quite
thirst
quenching
good
drinkability
this
could
be
a
good
football
game
day
beer
recommended
deep
orange
color
thin
stream
of
lively
carbonation
and
a
respectable
head
of
smooth

coarse
bubbles
solid

screams
lager
yeast
with
a
perfectly
subtle
malt
richness
and
the
faintest

of
hops
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
light
black
pepper

and
a
crisp
autumn
malt
sweetness
are
detectable
full
bodied
but
light
in
terms
of
gravity
this
beer
goes
down
in
big
gulps
so
fresh
unbelievable
carbonation
freshness
hop
spice
and
malt
smokiness
add
a
fauxsense
of
fall
spice
when
in
reality
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
well
crafted
four
ingredient
beer
mild
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
is
the
only
negative
i
can
see
here
difficult
beer
to
get
right
bill
and
ron
have
done
it
copper
colored
brew
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
not
much
retention
of
the
head
nor
much
lacing
relatively
transparent
considering
the
color
i
cant
really
detect
anything
with
my
nose
i
smell
malt
and
some
dried
fruit
but
its
faint
the
taste
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
smooth
and
refreshing
without
being
overly
sweet
or
bitter
a
balanced
beer
that
lacks
both
complexity
and
any
distinct
features
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
during
oktoberfest
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
have
often
throughout
the
year
slàinte
a
decent
octoberfest
beir
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
it
had
a
good
fall
oragne
color
with
a
clean
white
head
that
gives
lacing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
clean
muted
heavy
malt
and
a
bit
of
spciy
acidic
hops
it
has
the
traditional
marzen
taste
that
i
have
come
to
expect
of
these
beers
but
the
malt
seems
weak
a
little
overall
it
is
a
good
clean
beer
that
can
be
enjoy
enmass
and
would
be
a
solid
session
beir
all
session
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
although
the
aroma
had
me
second
guessing
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
taste
and
enjoy
it
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
typically
not
my
bag
pretty
enjoyable
very
nice
though
somewhat
on
the
darker
side
amber
color
not
a
lot
of
head
big
malty
and
sweet
aroma
malt
dominates
the
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
low
bitterness
nicecreamy
mouthfeel
not
to
sure
if
this
is
to
style
but
its
very
smooth
and
full
good
drinkabilitya
damn
good
lager
a
bit
heftier
then
an
average
fest
beer
but
damn
enjoyable
overall
not
a
great
ofest
definitely
not
my
favorite
victory
but
not
a
bad
example
to
sneak
in
a
mixed
sixer
of
ofests
im
surprised
how
thick
and
heavy
this
is
the
moutfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
and
the
beer
goes
down
heavy
this
is
not
what
i
wanted
out
of
a
marzen
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
little
hops
and
a
little
maltiness
theres
not
much
to
say
it
goes
down
hard
but
the
taste
isnt
complex
enough
or
stron
enough
to
explain
why
it
goes
down
that
way
eh
oktoberfest
only
comes
once
a
year
overall
not
much
of
a
beer
seems
to
be
missing
something
maybe
some
more
maltiness
good
oktoberfest
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
bright
copper
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
smell
is
a
slightly
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
and
maybe
some
cinammon
taste
is
a
big
doughy
malt
extravaganza
laced
with
caramel
and
nuts
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
flowery
hops
hitting
at
the
end
of
a
sip
and
lingering
into
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
ive
really
been
looking
forward
to
oktoberfest
beers
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
i
will
be
buying
again
this
season
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
creamy
white
head
smell
is
nutty
malty
and
breadlike
taste
follows
through
with
a
robust
maltiness
and
toatsed
nutts
finishes
big
and
malty
with
little
hops
present
a
really
good
drinking
session
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
each
year
mouthfeel
is
bubbley
smooth
light
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
on
this
guy
though
maltyness
could
get
to
be
too
much
after
a
few
still
id
drink
this
again
the
malty
sweetness
takes
a
bit
away
from
taste
and
drinkability
in
mine
scoring
but
i
could
imagine
this
being
in
my
fridge
again
biting
almost
skunky
hop
aroma
small
oatmeal
colored
head
slightly
sweet
malt
and
biscuity
flavors
spicy
hop
flavors
towards
the
middle
transparent
light
orange
colored
beer
solid
body
not
too
thick
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
solid
flavor
and
feel
not
much
to
look
at
and
the
aroma
while
not
bad
was
not
very
appealing
dn
im
sitting
here
in
front
of
my
computer
trying
to
finish
this
review
before
i
finish
this
beer
unbelievably
drinkable
the
tastes
are
just
right
it
feels
good
the
only
faults
i
could
spot
were
a
bit
of
a
weaker
aroma
than
i
was
expecting
probably
my
fault
for
waiting
so
long
to
drink
this
this
is
probably
the
best
marzen
ive
ever
had
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
enough
but
not
among
the
many
victory
brews
i
put
at
the
top
of
the
heap
taste
is
fullmouth
spiciness
like
pine
needle
spiciness
edged
with
alcohol
and
sharp
hops
malts
are
sweet
toasted
cereals
and
corn
very
flavorful
showing
an
aftertaste
of
toasted
grain
as
well
ample
carbonation
manages
somehow
to
not
be
sharp
at
all
refreshing
and
drinkable
its
not
perfect
but
especially
fresh
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
this
appeared
the
typical
clear
deep
orange
with
goodsized
white
fluffy
head
on
top
decent
lacing
and
head
retention
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
hops
biscuity
malt
starts
of
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
notes
of
grian
and
earthy
hops
were
also
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
about
average
here
with
nothing
really
standing
out
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
most
ofests
and
goes
down
easy
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
light
and
malty
with
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hops
nicely
balanced
just
a
touch
more
on
the
malty
side
like
it
should
be
for
this
style
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
as
well
some
toasted
malt
and
caramel
hints
of
toffee
and
hops
linger
on
the
finish
the
body
is
just
a
little
bit
light
the
drinkability
is
great
though
a
decent
marzen
bender
factor
adheres
to
the
ofest
style
perfect
to
guidelines
similar
to
otter
creek
without
the
metallic
afttertaste
beer
is
good
happy
beering
its
not
a
bad
beer
the
maltiness
still
pulls
through
with
almost
a
bit
of
nuttiness
maybe
victory
was
trying
something
a
bit
different
with
this
one
ontap
at
victory
dark
amber
like
a
marzen
should
be
a
nice
white
head
of
foam
as
well
that
lasts
and
leaves
nice
lacing
as
well
the
aromas
are
all
sweet
malts
up
front
and
nice
green
hops
on
the
back
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
more
pronounced
caramel
flavor
than
most
marzens
there
is
also
the
lovely
taste
of
bready
malts
and
fresh
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
is
very
festive
indeed
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
musty
and
slightly
malty
scent
that
is
dry
and
nutty
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
complex
but
not
very
good
flavor
it
is
slightly
malty
with
nutty
hints
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
it
has
a
breadlike
quality
that
detracts
from
the
taste
there
are
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
they
are
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
festbier
it
tries
to
be
unique
and
it
succeeds
it
is
uniquely
average
hmmm
was
this
a
victory
brew
my
first
disappointment
from
this
brewery
smell
was
heavily
malted
not
pleasant
taste
was
malt
on
the
front
with
a
light
hop
finish
very
unspectacular
mouthfeel
was
overly
oily
once
again
not
great
drinkability
suffers
likewise
drinkability
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
its
tasty
refreshing
and
you
can
drink
one
after
another
and
you
want
to
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
at
the
start
and
had
a
slightly
dry
and
smooth
finish
the
caramel
tones
lasted
briefly
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
very
drinakble
and
quite
enjoyable
supple
and
insanely
smooth
tongue
is
awash
in
sweet
malt
right
up
to
the
end
when
the
hops
take
hold
about
midbottle
the
hops
grow
in
flavor
not
a
bad
thing
and
blend
oh
so
perfectly
with
the
malt
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
ever
encountered
this
is
not
my
favorite
victory
brew
but
it
is
very
drinkable
it
is
light
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
one
of
the
barley
malt
and
a
kicker
of
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
by
comparison
with
the
good
german
fest
beers
this
is
not
quite
there
in
contrast
to
the
spaten
brews
and
the
like
this
is
superior
it
is
a
pretty
thick
feeling
beer
but
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
leading
to
drinking
more
than
one
a
very
nice
offering
from
victory
a
bit
thickerchewier
than
its
german
counterparts
it
fills
the
stomach
quicker
but
not
without
some
great
taste
nice
light
caramel
throughout
with
a
dash
of
hops
at
the
back
to
round
out
the
flavor
definitely
a
beer
to
have
with
food
pizza
andor
pretzels
come
to
mind
as
well
as
on
its
own
this
is
one
of
the
good
festbiers
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
gives
it
enough
flavor
to
be
worth
drinking
its
a
liquid
caramel
clear
body
with
a
decent
head
that
is
a
bit
fizzy
easy
drinking
and
another
example
that
victory
is
one
of
the
better
microbreweries
when
it
comes
to
lagers
draught
victory
this
one
pours
a
bit
of
a
coppery
color
with
only
a
little
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
a
fairly
decent
malt
nose
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
much
along
the
same
lines
there
is
a
bit
of
a
smokey
dry
taste
to
it
also
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
good
for
session
drinking
another
good
victory
brewthanks
andy
a
true
embodiment
of
that
classic
amber
flavor
of
oktoberfests
mainly
because
of
the
thin
body
and
flavor
profile
quaffable
and
easy
yet
a
sipper
too
if
you
wish
next
to
paulaner
for
me
as
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
drak
golden
amber
with
a
mediumcoarse
head
pretty
nice
an
sticky
fresh
hop
taste
and
surprisingly
grainy
for
a
beer
from
these
guys
malt
a
bit
less
pronounced
then
i
like
and
expected
still
it
had
good
balance
and
smooth
creamy
carbonation
not
my
1st
choice
if
in
an
oktoberfest
mood
but
still
a
good
easy
drinknig
session
beer
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
and
my
what
a
huge
frothy
head
the
body
was
deep
red
amber
this
looks
the
part
so
how
does
it
taste
this
beer
had
an
extremely
clean
and
smooth
yet
slightly
sweet
beginning
by
my
third
sip
the
beers
complexity
becomes
apparent
i
started
tasting
that
true
caramel
nut
oktoberfest
the
beer
ends
gets
a
bit
bitter
but
smoothes
out
by
the
end
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
a
moderate
dissipating
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
roastiness
with
a
faint
background
hoppy
aroma
the
tastemouthfeel
is
very
slightly
roasted
maltiness
with
a
mild
hopiness
which
gives
it
a
crisp
clean
finish
a
drinkable
clean
octoberfest
while
not
the
best
it
is
very
drinkable
brilliant
copper
body
topped
by
a
creamy
head
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
very
smooth
with
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
roasted
flavor
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
nice
fest
beer
prost
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
but
it
is
pretty
good
orange
peels
along
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
give
it
a
nice
flavoring
just
toned
down
some
sweetness
comes
in
but
it
stays
very
wellbalanced
orange
peels
also
add
an
interesting
note
it
is
very
drinkable
and
it
is
definitely
different
from
the
other
micro
oktobers
i
have
had
this
year
a
great
session
brew
but
just
a
bit
light
for
me
appearance
copper
amber
with
an
orange
glow
to
it
leaves
a
nice
sized
cream
vanilla
colored
head
with
sufficient
lacing
left
after
the
foam
wains
away
aroma
slight
floral
hop
note
lingers
in
there
but
more
importantly
a
toasted
malt
character
that
is
possibly
the
most
delicate
and
pleasant
from
an
oktoberfest
bier
to
this
point
mildly
sweet
bavarian
malts
a
blended
so
nicely
here
tase
defines
a
well
balanced
beer
not
tame
or
muted
just
made
in
an
accurate
approach
toward
the
oktoberfest
or
marzen
style
that
is
consumed
by
the
liter
in
munich
every
year
rolling
syrup
like
malt
sweetness
with
toasted
nuts
representing
as
the
backbone
of
delicious
tasty
brew
from
victory
mouthfeel
not
watery
but
medium
to
light
bodied
has
a
slightly
sticky
texture
that
glides
well
down
the
palate
drinkabilty
must
surely
be
the
most
drinkable
example
of
an
american
made
ofest
to
date
wow
just
awesome
beer
everyone
needs
to
sample
this
beer
then
go
out
and
buy
a
case
like
i
am
going
to
slightly
redtinged
amber
big
white
head
that
diminishes
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
some
maltiness
but
not
much
else
flavor
is
also
fairly
light
some
caramel
and
other
malt
sweetness
and
maybe
a
minimal
hop
hit
at
the
end
body
is
medium
at
best
mild
carbonation
drinks
easily
but
is
noting
spectacular
a
good
beer
but
not
in
the
stratosphere
like
most
of
victorys
offerings
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
truer
to
the
style
oktoberfests
i
have
sampled
draft
pour
left
little
head
atop
this
amberorangey
brew
bready
aroma
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
this
beer
seemed
to
have
more
of
an
alcohol
character
than
the
5
6
showed
bready
malts
balance
this
alcohol
flavor
nicely
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
clean
not
a
great
fall
seasonal
but
victory
has
stayed
true
to
the
style
as
they
usually
do
this
is
a
decent
seasonal
but
to
me
not
worth
seeking
out
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
malty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
caramel
flavor
its

makes
it
an
excellent
session
beer
another
solid
beer
from

one
of
the
better
oktoberfests

had
straight
4s
on
this
onepours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
a
little

is
of

very
appetizing
taste
is
malty

doughy
with
some
soapiness
in
the
finish
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
as
wellpretty
drinkable
man
i
love
this
time
of
year
sweet
maltiness
abounds
with
decoction
like
flavors
and
some
slightly
weird
fruitiness
that
i
cant
quite
figure
out
its
not
there
when
cold
and
shows
up
when
its
warm
a
sort
of
fig
like
flavor
very
round
flavor
overall
finishes
a
touch
on
the
phenolic
side
with
a
slightly
numbingthetipofthetongue
effect
alongside
some
green
apple
and
toasted
malt
flavors
about
910
of
the
way
to
being
an
outstanding
ofest
not
the
greatest
victory
product
but
would
purchase
again
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
doughy
bread
notes
malt
dominates
the
taste
as
well
starting
off

developing
a

toastiness
midpalate
bit
of

there
too

the
aftertaste
is

wellcarbonated
and

to
prevent

very
malty
and
somewhat
dry
there
is
a
slight
hop
character
very
refreshing
and
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
almost
any
food
it
is
not
overpowering
and
leads
to
being
drank
with
ease
and
in
copious
amounts
worth
seeking
out
on
tap
as
it
is
much
better
than
the
bottle
version
nice
orangey
glow
and
copper
in
color
good
white
head
that
stuck
around
the
glass
smell
was
all
over
the
place
very
complex
for
an
oktoberfest
lots
of
sweet
smelling
hops
and
malts
some
nutty
notes
and
roasted
barley
and
some
pale
citrus
taste
was
pretty
decent
not
bad
at
all
kinda
sweet
and
malty
bitter
very
clean
hop
feel
a
bit
watery
with
a
slight
sweet
twinge
on
the
tongue
its
a
drinkable
fest
but
this
could
be
bolder
and
slightly
heavier
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
a
bit
of
a
different
approach
to
the
fest
style
then
im
use
to
clear
orangecopper
color
nice
white
foamy
head
has
a
light
flowery
and
malty
caremel
aromas
sweet
balanced
malts
and
clean
tasting
light
body
a
little
thin
semiwatery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
nothing
special
there
are
alot
of
other
better
ones
out
there
creamy
bubbling
humdinger
head
a
perfect
darkish
amber
color
aroma
fresh
clean
floral
nuts
buttery
and
sweet
vanilla
bananas
soft
spices
little
hops
heavy
with
malt
incredibly
sweet
on
the
tongue
long
and
lovely
finish
a
tasty
sizzle
on
the
palate
very
flavorful
and
an
unusually
characterful
lager
one
of
the
more
subtle
but
satisfying
oktoberfests
ive
ever
enjoyed
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
persistent
white
head
sweetness
and
floral
hops
most
noticeable
in
the
nose
balance
is
great
with
the
floral
hop
flavors
carbonation
and
nuttytoffee
malts
blending
very
well
together
a
very
finely
crafted
brew
that
i
wish
were
available
in
my
area
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
finest
domestically
brewed
oktoberfests
but
more
importantly
one
that
easily
rivals
those
of
munich
it
pours
a
clear
reddishorangetinted
amber
body
topped
by
a
frothy
ivory
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
clearly
wellbrewed
the
aroma
begs
you
to
delve
deeper
with
a
softly
sweet
and
mildly
toasty
even
gently
bready
maltiness
thats
enhanced
by
a
delicate
floral
hoppiness
thats
quite
alluring
the
mouthfeel
is
gently
crisp
from
a
fine
carbonation
and
slick
across
the
palate
with
a
mediumfull
maltiness
the
flavor
starts
with
a
sweetish
maltiness
that
expresses
a
soft
toastiness
and
mild
toffee
notes
as
well
as
some
lightly
floral
hop
flavor
it
sweetens
slightly
as
it
warms
but
then
finishes
dry
with
some
gentle
bitterness
and
a
lingering
nutty
and
toasty
crust
of
bread
note
that
gives
it
exceptional
drinkability
it
continually
becons
to
you
taste
again
exceptionally
wellbalanced
and
rich
without
being
overbearing
as
much
as
victory
is
known
for
their
heavyhanded
beers
such
as
the
hop
drenched
prima
pils
they
should
also
be
recognized
for
their
beers
that
display
impeccable
balance
this
is
one
of
them
and
it
should
not
be
overlooked
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
ambercopperorange
color
and
was
very
clear
very
bright
seemed
to
glow
with
the
light
the
head
had
an
orange
tint
to
its
big
foamy
white
mound
the
aroma
was
of
herbs
hops
bread
yeasty
malt
and
some
hints
of
alcohol
near
the
end
slight
the
taste
was
of
roasted
bread
malt
herbs
hops
caramel
seemed
to
pick
up
near
the
middle
of
the
tongue
then
ends
with
the
nutty
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
flavor
a
good
example
of
this
style
of
fest
beer
this
went
perfectly
with
the
meatless
burger
surprisingly
tasty
that
i
shared
it
with
they
complemented
each
other
very
well
musty
maltold
sneaker
smell
crystal
amber
color
no
lasting
head
at
all
sweet
chewy
malt
flavor
with
a
smidge
of
hops
very
dissapointing
effort
for
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
label
says
victory
but
the
taste
is
not
one
of
a
victory
product
overly
sweet
unbalenced
and
no
head
retention
at
all
like
sweet
syrup
clear
bright
copper
body
with
a
fine
steady
stream
of
carbonation
head
came
foamy
up
and
quickly
left
leaving
behind
the
thinnest
of
tops
aroma
is
of
fresh
bread
from
the
bakery
up
the
block
not
strong
but
there
taste
is
of
deep
toasted
malts
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
not
overly
cloyingly
sweet
just
a
whisper
of
hops
i
believe
they
are
there
but
cant
be
sure
second
best
domestic
ofest
ive
had
this
season
a
malty
clean
tasting
fest
that
is
highly
drinkable
looks
great
in
the
glass
orangish
lace
coats
glass
nicely
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
the
body
rates
about
medium
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
toasted
grains
finishes
on
a
dry
spicy
note
very
drinkable
very
tasty
one
of
the
better
ofests
ive
had
this
year
heaven
knows
victory
has
more
than
enough
great
beers
to
keep
us
beer
geeks
more
than
happy
this
one
though
is
probably
made
to
keep
their
less
adventurous
brewpub
patrons
content
clear
amber
with
full
head
that
completely
vanished
aroma
mostly
of
caramel
malts
victory
has
put
forth
a
big
sturdy
malt
base
for
this
beer
and
leaves
it
at
that
no
appetizing
hop
dryness
no
traditional
spiciness
just
a
sweet
syrup
of
a
beer
hints
of
butter
but
cloying
wellmade
but
hohum
esp
for
victory
drinkability
low
for
a
fest
since
the
hops
do
not
pull
their
weight
in
creating
a
dry
tasty
finish
or
spiciness
not
bad
by
any
means
in
fact
those
who
dont
warm
to
ofests
might
actually
enjoy
this
especially
if
they
roam
around
the
dopplebock
end
of
the
spectrum
may
also
be
good
for
cooking
notes
next
time
i
have
this
beer
im
going
to
pair
it
up
with
a
big
fat
juicy
ruben
extra
kraut
please
i
think
victory
tackled
the
style
quite
well
with
this
one
a
must
try
for
any
beer
geek
that
makes
their
round
of
oktoberfest
beers
dark
gold
light
amber
color
with
a
low
head
light
spicy
malt
aroma
and
an
awesome
candylike
sweet
flavor
reminiscent
of
smarties
there
was
a
nutty
character
as
time
went
on
a
medium
bodied
and
creamy
brew
one
of
the
best
american
style
oktoberfests
in
my
tasting
this
beer
is
a
clear
amber
but
lacks
a
head
only
a
slight
collar
is
present
aroma
is
full
of
a
deep
maltiness
a
bit
of
a
candied
like
aroma
is
also
present
has
a
medium
full
body
and
unlike
many
ofest
this
one
has
a
taste
i
can
get
in
to
i
think
its
got
a
little
bit
more
of
a
munich
and
vienna
characteristic
than
a
lot
of
the
other
ofests
the
hebal
hops
accent
very
nicely
as
well
this
is
a
nicely
put
together
oktoberfest
very
clean
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
nice
effort
from
the
gang
at
victory
looks
very
much
like
an
am
version
of
style
in
that
greater
attention
to
amberorange
color
it
seems
many
german
ones
arent
so
dark
big
to
huge
full
head
light
toast
yet
pleasantly
sweet
malt
aroma
flavor
is
adequate
for
style
maltiness
with
roasty
quality
yet
nondistinct
for
many
ive
sampled
this
autumn
very
nice
creaminess
to
mouthfeel
with
nice
richness
without
being
heavy
and
not
excessive
in
carbonation
finish
is
fairly
long
lasting
with
pleasing
dryness
of
the
malt
and
not
bitter
352
deep
orangey
color
12
inch
foam
settles
to
a
skim
in
about
a
minute
malty
aroma
but
a
little
tang
in
there
malty
while
not
being
overly
sweet
good
body
early
proper
sense
of
a
good
toast
and
a
clean
finish
a
little
more
hops
than
some
while
lacking
some
nutty
qualities
there
seems
to
be
a
variety
of
opinions
on
this
beer
i
found
this
suitable
for
style
while
a
little
hoppy
and
quite
drinkable
aged
properly
according
to
marzen
style
the
color
and
head
look
promising
after
that
id
have
to
agree
with
previous
reviewers
that
this
is
subpar
for
victory
not
as
clean
as
a
marzen
should
be
imho
some
diacetyl
is
detected
and
i
thought
while
drinking
that
it
might
be
an
ale
just
verified
via
the
victory
site
that
its
indeed
a
lager
not
bad
but
very
unvictory
like
pours
a
smooth
amber
color
as
a
ofest
should
be
with
a
decent
lasting
pillow
like
offwhite
colored
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
barvarian
malts
slightly
nutty
and
caramel
on
the
palate
more
of
the
malts
caramel
german
hops
make
a
slight
bite
toasty
slight
graininess
not
really
complex
but
it
has
nice
full
flavor
with
depth
nice
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
ofest
imo
this
is
basically
a
solid
well
made
marzen
style
beer
but
not
up
to
victorys
usual
standards
carmel
and
mildly
toasty
sweetness
dominate
the
brew
at
times
the
sweetness
boarders
on
syrupy
not
much
of
a
head
and
the
aroma
is
understated
still
its
a
good
beer
but
not
typical
of
victory
taste
is
somewhat
light
fresh
and
quick
basically
sweet
caramelmalt
with
a
touch
of
very
light
hop
bitterness
to
balance
very
clean
soft
mouthfeel
fades
fast
a
real
good
session
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
autumn
the
perfect
fall
beer
and
for
me
the
most
eagerly
anticipated
each
year
from
bbc
picked
up
an
extra
case
to
enjoy
well
into
spring
right
around
their
enjoy
before
date
matures
and
reminisce
about
cool
fall
temps
solid
solid
beer
you
just
have
to
love
all
octoberfest
beers
its
just
not
that
good
full
bodied
and
rich

one
of
my
alltime
favorites
more
orange
less
sweet
more
spicy
longer

than
most
märzens
ive
had
lately
poured
into

not
a

fan
probably
my
least
favorite
s
a
beer
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
good
flavor
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
on
the
market
no
beer
snob
review
here
bottom
line
its
good
the
best
readily
available
oktoberfest
beer
you
will
find
perfect
fall
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
you
will
love
it
greatest
fall
beer
it
is
truly
a
must
good
seasonal
beer
i
always
pick
up
a
twelve
pack
when
october
comes
around
meh
another
okay
beer
id
have
this
over
bud
any
day
not
sure
why
this
beer
gets
no
love
on
ba
oh
well
i
guess
its
all
just
opinions
in
any
case
this
seems
to
be
a
classic
easytodrink
octoberfest
color
reminds
me
of
autumn
right
off
the
bat
some
malt
not
much
hops
on
the
nose
basically
what
you
would
expect
nice
rounded
mouthfeel
and
malt
flavor
although
nothing
exciting
or
memorable
imho
should
be
rated
a
bit
higher
on
ba
than
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
v
medium
fantastic
fun
beer
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
from
sam
adams
this
is
my
favorite
seasonal
beer
an
automatic
go
to
overall
another
decent
beer
from
sam
adams
i
appreciated
the
fullness
of
the
body
and
the
taste
i
would
have
made
the
taste
a
bit
stronger
and
a
bit
different
and
made
sure
that
the
beer
had
a
stronger
aroma
everything
you
desire
in
a
beer
this
could
be
the
perfect
beer
for
many
pretty
average
not
amazing
but
alright
still
a
beer
i
guess
great
beer
for
marzen
lovers
this
is
a
classic
in
my
bar
when
its
available
i
love
this
stuff
too
bad
its
only
seasonal
theres
really
not
much
that
is
truly
remarkable
about
this
beer
a
very
safe
sam
adams
interpretation
of
the
style
the
semiopaque
copper
colored
liquid
does
bring
a
whisper
of
autumn
and
the
changing
of
the
leaves
beyond
that
its
a
decidedly
average
beer
quite
sessionable
actually
with
a
nice
mix
of
pleasant
yet
tame
qualities
oddly
though
there
is
a
metallic
twang
to
this
beer
that
i
cant
quite
explain
in
that
respect
its
reminiscent
of
an
adjunct
lager
drank
straight
from
a
can
which
i
occasionally
find
enjoyable
however
the
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
tangy
bite
and
mild
amber
malt
characteristics
give
this
beer
much
more
character
than
your
average
bmc
the
light
spices
that
poke
through
on
the
finish
are
a
nice
touch
that
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
quite
an
interesting
beer
it
simultaneously
manages
to
be
innocuous
and
common
yet
has
just
enough
character
and
style
to
keep
you
going
back
for
more
i
guess
thats
why
sam
is
among
the
kings
of
craft
they
have
found
a
way
to
make
subtle
flavor
and
artistry
appeal
to
the
masses
fantastic
by
sam
adams
the
can
is
also
beautiful
its
almost
ok
spice
is
overpowering
to
the
pint
of
annoyance
there
are
so
many
other
good
beers
in
this
flavor
range
to
mess
with
this
one
again
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
tasty
oktoberfest
beer
classic
great
beer
tastes
delicious
mediumlight
bodied
medium
carbonation
decent
drinkability
enjoy
if
you
wish
paired
perfectly
with
sausage
stuffing
contrasted
sweet
potatoes
o
might
not
be
the
best
or
most
authentic
but
does
just
fine
as
a
session
brew
at
an
equally
inauthentic
but
fun
oktoberfest
party
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
my
favorite
in
the
line
of
sam
adams
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
overall
i
would
take
this
beer
over
other
drafts
at
a
local
steakhouse
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
like
i
said
the
difference
between
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
and
the
standard
sam
adams
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
good
representation
of
bottled
autumn
märzenoktoberfest
beer
with
notable
aromas
of
honey
beautiful
copper
color
well
carbnated
light
to
medium
body
sweet
pumpkin
notes
nice
overall
ill
get
it
again
next
year
this
a
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
it
has
the
traditional
taste
and
in
my
opinion
does
not
bitter
out
as
it
gets
warmer
like
some
other
marzens
do
first
octoberfest
i
had
and
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
into
beer
sweet
toffee
flavor
among
others
not
terrible
in
fact
after
my
first
tasting
i
had
about
4
more
but
im
not
really
a
fan
of
autumn
beers
and
am
thus
a
bit
biased
however
its
pound
cake
like
consistency
really
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
surprised
by
it
being
a
seasonal
and
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
but
this
one
really
stuck
with
me
im
a
fan
of
octoberfest
beers
so
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
its
maybe
a
little
too
onedimensional
as
you
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
caramel
more
than
anything
else
but
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
some
tubed
meat
and
be
pretty
happy
meh
not
all
that
impressed
like
most
sams
this
is
a
dumbed
down
version
of
the
real
deal
thats
marketed
to
the
newcomer
to
the
micro
scene
would
order
it
if
theres
no
other
marzens
on
tap
and
the
month
happens
to
be
october
but
otherwise
meh
pours
crystal
clear
dark
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
pleasant
smell
of
sweet
caramel
notes
followed
by
some
nuttiness
taste
follows
nose
with
a
sweet
caramelnuttiness
follow
by
an
earthy
smooth
clean
finish
mouth
feel
is
pretty
smooth
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
for
samuel
adams
with
a
great
price
tag
to
boot
not
a
bad
seasonal
if
you
just
want
an
easy
drinking
malty
brew
cheers
better
than
paulaner
oktoberfest
marzen
and
hackerpschorr
oktoberfestmärzen
overall
a
solid
and
dare
i
say
it
commercial
version
of
the
oktoberfest
there
are
a
good
number
of
richer
and
arguably
more
flavorful
oktoberfests
out
there
but
at

what
do
you
expect
this
would
be
a
good
idea
to
pick
up
as
a
12
pack
for
a
football
tailgate
or
something
along
those
lines
since
many
people
would
find
this
beer
agreeable
and
nonoffensive
while
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
someone
offered
it
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
for
myself
tasty
overall
this
is
a
good
octoberfest
beer
true
to
the
style
reasonably
priced
at
12
99
for
a
variety
12
pack
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoy
it
during
the
season
o
one
of
my
winter
favorites
overall
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
if
not
the
best
tastes
of
caramel
butterscotch
bready
and
light
fruit
taste
malty
and
a
little
bitter
very
solid
beer
great
ill
go
on
to
the
next
not
very
oktoberfesty
but
not
bad
malty
heavy
slightly
tangy
this
beers
looks
great
deep
amber
hue
with
a
frothy
head
the
problem
i
have
with
it
is
the
cloying
sweetness
hops
are
barely
discernible
its
just
an
overwhelming
toffee
like
sweetness
with
a
weird
apple
like
aftertaste
really
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
o
a
really
solid
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
and
aroma
also
a
really
good
value
the
caramel
notes
predominate
almost
a
little
too
sweet
overall
marzen
is
not
my
favorite
style
as
i
prefer
a
bigger
hop
character
but
as
a
seasonal
this
is
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
around
love
the
fullness
and
taste
best
octoberfest
i
have
tried
thus
far
expected
nothing
less
from
samuel
adams
solid
brew
glass
dimpled
mug
decent
but
cant
compete
with
the
german
oktoberfest
brews
well
balanced
with
a
friendly
hint
of
spice
and
apples
his
oktoberfest
lacked
the
finishing
punch
for
me
ill
drink
it
again
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
bolder
offering
of
this
style
great
lakes
brewings
oktoberfest
is
hard
to
beat
enjoyed
a
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
dark
reddish
bronze
with
a
finger
or
so
of
beige
creamy
head
aroma
of
rich
toasty
malts
and
fresh
green
grapes
almost
whiskeylike
sweet
toffee
with
a
light
whiff
of
yeast
classic
ofest
really
body
is
on
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
is
intense
but
in
getting
past
these
aspects
one
can
find
some
toasted
bread
crust
sultana
light
molasses
apples
pears
and
even
some
faint
citrus
weighted
towards
the
crisp
dry
and
toasty
not
particularly
sweet
particularly
in
the
finish
this
may
not
have
as
much
of
the
classic
german
malt
character
you
get
in
some
old
world
examples
but
there
is
a
solid
noble
hop
flavor
and
the
rich
deep
flavors
edge
out
some
of
the
european
examples
in
my
view
apparently
it
is
not
cool
to
rate
this
beer
highly
screw
that
noise
quality
is
quality
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
interpretations
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
crisp
refreshing
enjoyable
another
beer
that
you
will
certainly
enjoy
drinking
but
wont
consider
a
trophy
in
the
fridge
i
guess
i
just
love
the
boston
lager
too
much
i
expected
this
to
maybe
have
something
that
the
lager
doesnt
but
its
not
there
over
all
not
my
favorite
sort
of
middle
of
the
pack
but
very
drinkable
overall
great
session
beer
its
good
on
the
remaining
warm
days
of
septoct
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
didnt
have
the
metallic
flaw
so
ive
adjusted
the
ratings
a
good
but
not
outstanding
oktoberfest
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
if
on
sale
or
in
their
fall
mixed
12
pack
for
a
super
deal
like
i
got
then
go

yeah
yeah
i
know
sam
adams
isnt
even
a
craft
brewery
anymore
theyre
too
commercial
they
just
crank
out
any
old
thing
and
slap
a
label
on
it
translation
theyre
not
the
new
hot
thing
stipulated
and
most
serious
craft
beer
fans
would
rather
give
up
a
body
part
than
be
caught
actually
liking
something
like
this
octoberfest
but
as
im
too
old
and
cranky
to
give
a
shit
about
what
anyone
else
thinks
here
it
is
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
a
really
fine
example
of
this
style
its
got
that
hallmark
marzen
heartiness
great
caramel
and
citrus
notes
and
subtle
but
nicely
resiny
hops
it
like
all
great
octoberfest
beers
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
which
is
probably
why
the
roving
packs
of
wetnosed
craft
geeks
dont
like
it
but
if
youre
a
mature
thoughtful
beer
connoisseur
youll
like
this
a
lot
walk
right
past
the
craft
experts
and
pick
this
up
for
a
taste
of
how
a
great
american
brewery
does
german
solid
contribution
to
octobefest
for
those
who
dont
like
pumpkin
exceptional
oktoberfest
style
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
tasty
overall
a
really
nice
beer
this
is
the
2nd
octoberfest
that
i
have
had
this
season
and
i
like
this
one
more
i
hope
to
get
a
few
more
this
season
and
see
where
they
stack
up
o
refreshing
especially
with
dinner
fairly
light
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
3
755
you
can
tell
its
an
octoberfest
style
beer
but
wow
it
tastes
very
watery
to
me
a
must
have
a
good
everyday
beer
for
the
season
i
look
forward
to
the
release
every
year
100oz
long
tube
beer
was
great
from
tap
not
too
strong
with
spices
had
just
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
till
0
oz
o
a
solid
brew
has
some
drawbacks
but
is
still
good
45
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
this
brew
is
perfect
for
a
cool
autumn
day
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
dont
see
what
the
big
deal
is
here
id
try
another
in
case
i
want
to
change
my
review
but
i
dont
really
want
to
spend
money
on
another
one
of
these
when
sam
adams
makes
other
brews
that
i
actually
like
overall
2
84
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
im
trying
to
like
it
i
really
am
but
unfortunately
the
taste
of
the
stale
spice
and
the
bitter
sour
pumpkin
did
it
in
for
me
i
dont
know
what
the
hype
is
about
it
its
very
gross
very
mawkish
and
distasteful
try
some
other
oktoberfests
youll
be
glad
you
did
this
is
like
the
bud
light
of
oktoberfests
just
skip
it
am
i
the
only
one
that
seems
to
think
this
beer
has
gone
down
hill
over
the
last
two
years
its
just
always
tasking
skunky
now
not
good
i
always
look
forward
to
picking
this
up
when
it
becomes
offered
on
shelves
i
drink
so
much
of
it
through
the
fall
that
it
somewhat
gets
tiring
but
it
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
beers
out
there
i
love
the
carmel
and
malt
flavors
cheers
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
sams
three
consistent
seasonals
the
spring
one
seems
to
change
annually
these
days
its
a
tasty
approachable
lager
that
should
suit
anyone
on
a
fall
day
great
beer
for
an
autumn
afternoon
with
some
pretzels
and
football
appearance
is
standard
octoberfest
smell
is
kind
of
lacking
not
muck
comes
to
the
nose
whomever
i
did
pour
into
liter
boot
so
a
little
more
difficult
to
smell
a
little
more
hoppy
than
most
and
that
is
good
it
is
a
very
smooth
drink
with
carmel
taste
the
smoothy
finish
is
the
best
part
overall
not
to
bad
could
drink
several
of
these
prosit
giving
it
a
45
because
my
mom
also
liked
it
and
she
doesnt
like
beer
usually
overall
you
can
tell
that
your
drinking
an
american
interpretation
of
the
classic
fest
beer
from
germany
its
got
standard
octoberfest
flavors
but
with
a
bit
more
hop
presence
and
a
fruity
taste
not
bad
at
all
but
not
one
i
need
to
rush
out
to
get
this
fall
oktoberfest
is
my
favorite
during
this
time
of
year
pours
a
rich
copperamber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
a
lot
which
is
common
for
many
brews
of
this
style
the
aroma
for
the
most
part
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
pretty
close
with
a
hint
of
burnt
brown
sugar
in
theere
also
medium
bodied
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
goes
down
easy
and
it
a
really
good
oktoberfest
style
brew
i
bet
it
is
even
better
on
tap
prosit
if
you
cant
find
any
other
octoberfest
beers
this
one
isnt
bad
aroma
and
appearance
are
nice
are
right
but
the
it
lacked
a
little
in
subtle
taste
of
its
german
counterparts
it
is
a
true
to
from
octoberfest
brew
in
mouth
feel
i
cant
say
anything
that
hasnt
been
said
before
so
i
wont
its
a
good
jumping
off
point
for
ofest
style
beers
but
there
are
better
offerings
also
as
one
of
the
alstrom
bros
stated
i
feel
this
beer
has
been
subtly
changing
from
year
to
year
its
2014
and
this
is
not
the
same
beer
i
first
tried
back
in
2006ish
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
has
definitely
been
changing
over
time
medium
body
good
stuff
its
alright
not
bad
would
drink
again
pours
and
smells
lovely
but
is
shockingly
sweet
if
you
like
i
dont
like
sweet
beers
stay
away
despite
the
high
ba
rating
and
respectful
abv
always
good
very
consistent
very
available
the
beer
is
good
the
mass
production
with
availability
everywhere
to
me
loses
its
luster
is
this
the
best
beer
from
the
boston
beer
company
no
definitely
not
but
i
promise
you
its
the
best
one
you
can
buy
in
a
bottle
at
your
local
gas
station
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottle
best
by
january
2015
nicely
done
decent
poured
out
of
there
new
sweet
looking
can
props
for
the
design
color
is
darkish
brown
with
brownish
white
head
not
much
aroma
very
malty
flavor
i
dont
think
there
can
be
better
felt
the
hint
of
fall
in
the
air
and
cracked
open
one
ahh
just
like
last
years
flavor
almost
like
dinking
that
fall
feeling
sweet
flavor
of
spices
and
a
very
pleasant
lingering
after
taste
thumbs
up
sam
pours
a
deep
orangebrown
color
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
full
of
mellow
flavors
and
toasted
malt
the
taste
was
very
nice
with
good
mixtures
of
heavy
malt
with
a
slight
citrus
tang
on
the
end
to
make
this
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
for
when
the
seasons
start
to
change
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
refreshing
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
clear
amber
two
finger
head
with
spotty
lacing
this
is
a
sweet
malty
brew
thats
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
hops
are
sorely
missing
or
very
light
ones
enough
overall
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
perhaps
serving
with
sugar
cookies
is
not
the
best
idea
as
the
combination
of
the
appleorange
juice
and
cookies
took
me
back
to
preschool
for
me
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
a
fall
tradition
like
halloween
and
the
changing
of
the
leaves
without
it
autumn
wouldnt
be
the
same
a
bit
better
than
last
year
still
yearning
for
the
beer
they
brewed
years
ago
i
use
to
buy
10
cases
when
it
was
a
craft
brew
unfortunately
now
mass
produced
it
has
lost
the
subtle
flavors
that
made
it
great
im
now
down
to
one
beer
a
year
i
really
liked
this
beer
very
light
mouthfeel
with
a
beautiful
caramel
color
it
had
a
warm
feel
to
it
like
a
good
friend
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
o
samuel
adams
octoberfest
although
being
my
first
taste
into
the
oktoberfest
style
was
an
enjoyable
experience
to
say
the
least
not
only
is
the
beer
nice
to
look
at
but
it
holds
some
beautiful
aromas
and
tastes
that
leave
you
in
satisfaction
this
brew
is
easily
my
favourite
lager
and
also
my
new
favourite
samuel
adams
beer
well
done
guys
o
it
is
what
it
is
i
know
people
seem
to
polarize
around
this
beer
but
its
an
easy
drinker
that
is
loaded
with
malts
its
not
too
complex
and
it
may
not
be
the
truest
to
the
style
but
its
a
nice
drinker
after
a
day
of
work
when
you
dont
want
to
think
too
much
about
what
youre
drinking
a
little
better
but
still
that
that
mass
produced
taste
o
an
excellent
version
of
this
brew
got
it
in
kalamazoo
at
tiffanys
drinking
it
in
port
huron
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
that
highlights
the
fall
season
full
of
flavor
with
an
outstanding
malt
flavor
great
marzen
love
this
time
of
year
o
not
bad
really
this
one
got
knocks
more
for
the
astringent
aftertaste
than
anything
else
also
the
crystal
wasnt
balanced
very
well
still
pretty
drinkable
though
the
colder
the
better
overall
theres
a
nice
amount
of
caramel
flavor
with
a
slight
noble
hop
bitterness
to
help
balance
it
out
i
personally
would
prefer
a
little
more
depth
in
the
mouthfeel
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
the
smell
and
taste
remind
me
of
fall
and
it
is
so
smooth
to
drink
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
lacing
left
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
a
smooth
beer
that
reminds
me
of
fall
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
so
smooth
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
samuel
adams
does
it
again
picked
this
up
as
a
single
bottle
at
a
liquor
store
and
im
very
glad
i
did
im
drinking
it
now
and
its
a
wonderful
beer
i
can
taste
the
malt
and
caramel
this
is
truly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
love
to
have
more
overall
okay
i
know
its
mass
produced
and
no
longer
a
micro
brew
and
people
love
to
hate
sam
adams
but
this
is
my
go
to
octoberfest
i
love
it
i
look
forward
every
year
when
it
is
released
i
am
not
sure
if
it
it
just
the
nostalgia
that
surrounds
this
beer
to
me
but
it
is
always
solid
offering
from
sam
and
it
is
consistently
good
its
a
good
beer
and
ill
prob
have
it
again
quality
beer
and
quantity

this
brew
pours
out
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
some
sweetness
there
is
not
much
to
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
with
spices
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
over
powering
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
pleasent
and
crisp
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of

samuel
adams
octoberfest
was
better
than
what
i
expecting
i
would
get
this
brew
again
if
your
an
o
fest
fan
like
myself
you
should
for
sure
pick
up
a
sixer
this
year
i
think
you
will
agree
that
the
flavor
and
drinkability
are
up
a
few
notches
from
years
past
i
love
this
beer
its
great
around
the
fall
season
its
got
a
good
taste
and
a
really
nice
flavor
with
food
like
deserts
such
as
nuts
and
pies
one
of
favorite
beers
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
i
am
not
a
huge
sam
adams
drinker
but
this
on
did
by
far
the
best
in
my
opinion
its
really
full
flavored
so
i
will
be
stocking
up
when
this
beer
comes
back
you
can
count
on
that
hahaha
overall
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
the
mixed
12pk
has
some
nice
offerings
good
price
point
and
very
easy
to
find
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
sam
adams
my
personal
favorite
beer
wonderfully
balanced
warm
aroma
that
gently
whiffs
of
the
hop
character
beautiful
slightly
browned
head
and
a
lovely
amber
color
the
warmth
of
the
malt
followed
by
a
smoothly
bitter
hop
bite
comes
on
nicely
and
leaves
only
a
slight
aftertaste
making
you
want
more
not
too
heavy
but
definitely
nowhere
near
what
youd
call
light
perfect
compliment
to
a
meal
or
to
be
consumed
on
its
own
another
great
beer
from
sam
adams
theres
not
much
more
i
can
say
that
already
hasnt
been
said
great
smell
and
flavor
in
my
opinion
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
marzen
style
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
sam
adams
beers
and
ive
always
been
partial
to
their
octoberfest
o
i
love
a
good
malty
marzen
and
this
is
a
good
marzen
everything
is
right
about
it
for
the
style
o
my
own
minioktoberfest
consisted
of
a
blind
sidebysidebyside
tasting
of
oktoberfests
by
sam
adams
saranac
and
dundee
somewhat
surprisingly
sammy
adams
didnt
take
the
gold
im
not
very
well
versed
in
oktoberfests
but
sam
adams
seemed
to
be
about
an
average
oktoberfest
and
only
somewhat
better
than
average
overall
most
authentic
marzen
but
one
i
will
always
have
a
few
of
every
fall
cheers
mr
koch
one
of
my
first
nonbmc
beers
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
its
not
an
amazing
beer
for
my
tastes
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
malty
finish
but
not
cloying
a
solid
choice
at
many
bars
that
dont
carry
much
in
the
way
of
craft
beer
o
affordable
and
available
everywhere
a
nice
beer
for
the
fall
months
its
a
decent
oktoberfest
malt
is
the
driving
force
here
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
and
ill
still
get
it
again
next
year
however
its
certainly
not
the
gold
standard
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile33341viewbeerfly
overall
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
around
cant
go
wrong
with
one
o
decent
marzen
sessionable
pairs
well
with
mexican
overall
i
loved
this
beer
it
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
styles
great
version
of
an
american
octoberfest
love
it
and
stock
it
in
the
fridge
when
it
comes
out
each
fall
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
that
will
remind
you
of
the
season
but
it
does
not
have
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
in
repeated
drinking
overall
malty
and
hits
the
general
area
of
a
maerzen
flavors
not
quite
right
though
lacking
depth
maybe
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
perfectly
matches
the
season
as
well
as
the
fall
foods
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modes
tamount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
nice
but
really
buttery
almost
to
fault
for
my
palate
honestly
this
beer
might
be
my
favorite
however
that
might
be
skewed
because
of
it
only
being
a
limited
availability
it
has
a
great
color
coupled
with
a
smell
that
just
smells
like
sam
adams
bottled
fall
the
flavors
go
together
nicely
and
will
have
you
trying
to
figure
out
what
each
one
is
until
you
get
too
inebriated
to
care
i
love
this
beer
and
this
year
ive
tried
several
other
brands
of
octoberfest
beers
and
found
myself
preferring
this
one
over
all
of
the
others
all
of
the
taste
combined
with
the
price
makes
the
beer
a
hit
its
aite
and
all
and
by
that
raul
means
drinkable
but
like
the
fountain
of
youth
raul
wants
something
that
will
make
him
want
to
dig
in
for
more
o
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
fall
i
would
recommend
picking
up
the
sam
adams
variety
pack
at
wholesaler
you
cant
beat
the
price
1
05
or
so
for
each
bottle
including
this
wonderful
brew
is
a
great
price
and
well
worth
every
cent
copper
with
modest
head
that
disappears
all
biscuit
malt
in
the
aroma
with
some
alcohol
some
fruitiness
bready
malt
and
nuttiness
come
through
in
the
flavor
why
did
i
just
sense
cooked
tomato
weird
medium
body
makes
it
quite
drinkable
nothing
earth
shattering
but
itll
do
on
a
fall
evening
this
beer
is
more
like
a
fruit
of
the
loom
model
although
shiners
is
not
as
depressive
i
would
say
warsteiner
held
its
superiority
in
this
contest
their
imperial
series
s
a
is
excellent
because
it
is
so
powerful
like
a
vogue
magazine
cover
that
peasant
women
will
never
be
on
overall
overall
a
decent
shot
at
the
style
respectable
but
not
special
i
would
get
this
again
due
to
its
price
and
availability
good
crowd
pleaser
and
would
go
well
with
fall
gatherings
for
football
paired
with
chili
or
red
meat
right
now
though
the
winner
for
oktoberfests
goes
to
victory
festbier
o
a
staple
when
it
comes
to
octoberfest
styles
done
well
enough
to
drink
multiples
of
second
to
only
millstreams
octoberfest
samuel
adams
has
a
fantastic
product
on
their
hands
with
their
octoberfest
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
there
is
always
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
taste
malty
but
again
only
perfunctorily
nicely
rounded
rather
mild
i
wish
to
reach
for
the
descriptor
rich

almost
dry
and
with
some
nutty
and
earthy
malts
has
a
nice
toasted
quality
but
not
much
sweetness
and
the
spice
stays
faint
even
though
it
does
present
a
bit
more
on

nose
an
don
the
palate

the
beer
warms
my
criticism
of
the
taste
is
that
buttery
quality
i
dont
like
it
on
the
palate
or
in
the
mouthfeel
it
has
a
sour
little
under
taste
and
together
with
the
buttery
flavor
is
just
not
what
i
want
it
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
even
though
it
drinks
pretty
light
this
is
my
first
octoberfest
beer
utopiajanesep

and
even
outside

it
comes
up
just

i
dont

the
full
bodied
flavor
that
i
was

in

tall

and
can
not
something
i
would

tall

also
brings
back
the

initially
expected

reduces

upgraded

not

this
beer
is
somewhat

than

final
grade

a
respectable
b
grade
of
all
the
marzens
ive
tried
as
limited
a
pool
as
that
is
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
probably
my
favourite
so
far
not
outstanding
complex
or
especially
memorable
but
a
solid
brew
in
its
own
right
something
that
would
go
nicely
with
a
hearty
meal
as
well
as
on
its
own
in
a
pinch
id
probably
just
stick
with
their
boston
lager
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
heftier
slightly
more
warming
lager
for
the
fall
months
id
consider
picking
this
one
up
again
next
year
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
coppery
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
to
a
film
over
the
top
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
and
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
and
hops
flavor
is
a
pleasant
lightly
toasted
somewhat
biscuity
malt
with
slight
light
fruit
and
caramel
solid
biscuit
malt
finish
with
light
hops
medium
bodied
a
nice
take
on
an
octoberfest
not
complex
but
with
the
expected
solid
malt
body
and
finish
d
im
certainly
no
expert
on
this
particular
style
but
what
better
way
to
familiarize
myself
with
it
than
reviewing
the
most
popular
oktoberfest
on
the
market
while
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
fall
brew
i
found
it
enjoyable
enough
o
solid
allaround
but
not
my
favorite
very
affordable
and
drinkable
though
not
a
bad
marzen
at
all
especially
for
one
thats
so
easily
available
this
was
decent
but
nothing
overly
special
with
profiles
that
leaned
to
the
sweeter
side
but
there
was
just
enough
crispness
to
keep
this
mostly
accessible
and
drinkable
feeling
i
tend
to
like
this
one
a
bit
more
on
draft
which
is
how
ive
usually
had
it
over
the
years

this
beer
pours
up
a
beautiful
copper
with
a
large
tan
head
elaborate
lacing
is
left
as
the
glass
is
emptied
the
nose
is
fruit
and
roasted
nuts
a
pretty
pleasant
if
understated
smell
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thick
and
syrupy
taste
is
very
sweet
with
sweet
roasted
malt
from
begiining
to
end
my
main
issue
is
that
it
tastes
a
little
one
dimensional
id
like
it
to
have
a
bit
more
assertive
finish
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
and
would
take
another
if
offered
overall
smooth
with
some
nice
roast
and
malt
while
not
the
very
the
best
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
it
is
quite
nice
a
good
go
to
for
more
session
style
drinking
one
of
the
best
octoberfests
ive
had
pours
with
an
orange
hue
good
carbonation
taste
is
good
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
average
i
enjoy
this
beer
during
this
time
of
year
i
will
buy
more
next
year
i
can
drink
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
marzen
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoy
drinking
it
o
embodying
the
essence
of
fall
the
malty
aroma
encourages
the
mentality
to
shift
from
light
crisp
beers
to
maltier
lagers
before
turning
to
full
rich
stouts
and
the
like
if
there
wasnt
the
pesky
mineral
finish
thats
almost
metallic
at
points
id
really
really
love
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
very
good
oktoberfest
one
i
can
drink
quite
a
bit
of
in
season
its
just
held
back
from
greatness
o
a
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
and
for
the
style
one
of
the
only
craft
beers
that
my
wife
will
drink
she
actually
looks
forward
to
it
coming
out
each
year
a
great
beer
to
have
with
dinner
on
a
cool
fall
day
but
not
something
i
would
ask
for
or
purchase
on
my
own
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
beer
it
has
all
the
hearty
and
tasty
malts
that
are
supposed
to
be
there
the
subtly
bitter
finish
was
a
little
different
touch
which
was
nice
i
wish
the
head
characteristics
were
a
little
better
overall
this
is
a
nice
fall
beer
from
sam
adams
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
an
appropriately
sized
mug
the
modest
lacing
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
handsome
deep
orange
body
below
modestly
sweet
toffee
aromas
are
complemented
by
subtle
fruity
leafy
and
nutty
notes
theres
a
tad
more
depth
of
flavor
than
the
nose
would
suggest
although
its
not
as
robust
as
id
like
lingering
tangy
toffee
and
mild
sweetness
are
the
closest
things
we
have
to
lasting
impressions
here
appropriately
mild
bitterness
with
modest
leafy
hop
flavor
and
carbonation
notions
of
bread
crust
with
apple
butter
a
touch
thickish
on
the
palate
quite
easily
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
o
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
six
from
the
fall
sampler
pack
o
a
well
craft
octoberfest
i
will
always
drink
one
of
these
highly
drinkable
honestly
im
not
a
big
marzen
fan
in
general
but
this
is
just
fine
for
a
beer
with
lunch
on
a
day
like
this
a
solid
and
enjoyable
marzen
something
i
dont
mind
having
a
6pack
of
its
a
beer
i
would
be
glad
to
drink
again
but
not
one
i
will
be
excited
to
tell
my
friends
about
o
i
like
this
beer
alot
goes
down
easy
love
the
malt
flavor
i
could
slam
several
of
these
in
a
short
amount
of
time
a
decent
octoberfest
by
samuel
adams
pours
the
colors
of
autumn
its
a
really
nice
looking
beer
has
a
creamy
head
and
good
carbonation
smell
is
very
faint
and
not
much
going
on
i
expected
to
smell
the
5
malts
stronger
than
this
taste
is
delicious
with
malts
no
single
overpowering
malt
flavor
just
a
complex
of
many
malt
flavors
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
for
this
style
with
a
slight
creaminess
overall
its
a
great
beer
that
i
enjoyed
the
more
i
drank
it
will
be
a
definite
buy
every
fall
all
in
all
a
very
balanced
easily
drinkable
tribute
to
marzens
and
oktoberfest
seasonal
beers
while
not
my
alltime
favorite
its
still
an
undeniably
well
made
offering
from
samuel
adams
a
crowd
pleasure
for
sure
despite
being
too
a
little
malty
for
me
personally
recommended
a
try
overall
a
nice
fall
brew
very
drinkable
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
nothing
super
here
but
nothing
bad
either
very
much
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pretty
well
balanced
in
flavors
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
great
beer
ive
enjoyed
quite
a
few
of
these
and
can
always
rely
on
sam
adams
for
a
good
brew
give
it
a
try
o
the
sweetness
is
constant
but
subdued
very
malty
but
not
the
malt
profile
i
prefer
overall
its
decent
but
unremarkable
only
indication
of
bottling
date
is
a
notch
out
of
feb
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
which
matches
the
traditional
style
perfectly
but
maybe
thats
a
sell
by
date
overall
im
sure
this
is
best
on
draught
ill
have
it
again
o
just
an
overall
good
beer
ive
had
better
octoberfests
though
o
a
solid
marzen
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
depth
of
flavor
but
its
still
tasty
and
clean
o
this
is
good
for
what
it
is
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
marzen
beers
sam
adams
really
gets
this
right
comparing
this
to
its
competitors
sam
adams
takes
the
gold
in
my
opinion
there
are
more
complex
and
well
i
guess
you
could
call
them
better
beers
in
this
style
but
when
all
else
fails
this
one
is
great
just
the
look
of
the
bottle
with
the
taste
feels
nostalgic
to
me
even
though
this
is
the
very
first
time
ive
had
sam
adams
octoberfest
it
just
makes
me
feel
good
for
whatever
reason
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
about
what
youd
expect
from
sam
adams
maybe
a
little
bit
better
the
only
other
seasonal
ive
had
from
them
is
their
summer
ale
and
this
is
much
better
than
that
i
enjoy
it
when
poured
it
has
an
absolutely
stunning
deep
orangered
color
into
the
traditional
sam
adams
glass
decent
head
even
if
it
is
gone
too
quickly
and
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
dry
notes
in
the
back
are
a
perfect
counter
to
the
malt
taste
in
the
front
and
the
spice
in
the
middle
aroma
is
mild
but
not
to
the
point
of
nonexistence
and
the
bouquet
of
fall
season
comes
out
the
more
the
beer
is
sloshed
around
in
the
glass
a
wonderful
flowery
note
on
the
top
of
the
aroma
the
carbonation
is
high
but
the
beer
is
pretty
full
bodied
so
it
doesnt
make
the
beer
too
soday
i
have
had
a
ton
of
octoberfests
over
the
last
few
years
and
yet
every
year
this
is
the
one
that
defines
the
season
for
me
a
wonderful
wonderful
beer
o
a
great
sessioon
beer
for
malt
lovers
overall
definitely
not
the
best
ofest
out
there
and
definitely
not
one
of
sam
adamss
standouts
its
fine
enough
in
the
fall
variety
pack
but
definitely
not
something
id
seek
out
on
its
own
o
this
certainly
isnt
bad
but
seems
a
bit
pedestrian
a
nice
introduction
to
the
marzen
style
for
those
where
sam
adams
may
be
the
only
craft
brewer
in
the
market
but
there
are
far
better
out
there
not
a
real
complex
beer
the
malt
very
much
dominates
it
does
go
down
nice
and
easy
and
is
pretty
good
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
either
if
you
like
malty
beers
this
is
the
one
to
try
really
good
one
of
the
best
widely
available
seasonals
out
there
definitely
recommended
a
not
bad
however
i
seem
to
remember
last
years
batch
being
a
bit
better
overall
easy
drinking
fall
seasonal
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
lets
say
we
look
forward
to
these
fall
brews
after
a
long
hot
summer
i
like
this
one
frankly
i
really
enjoy
most
of
the
sam
adams
seasonal
beers
they
are
distinct
but
at
the
same
time
not
at
all
busy
their
octoberfest
is
a
wonderful
malty
carameltinged
beer
perfect
for
transitioning
into
the
colder
weather
it
goes
down
smooth
and
begs
to
be
followed
with
another
an
exemplary
marzen
and
very
easy
to
find
across
the
nation
o
not
a
hateful
beer
but
not
the
best
the
good
things
are
you
can
find
it
almost
any
where
i
will
gladly
buy
it
again
in
the
fall
season
this
beer
would
go
nicely
with
a
wonderful
cd
called
time
travel
by
gunter
muller
otomo
yoshihide
on
a
cool
fall
night
while
the
fire
roasts
in
your
craftsman
style
home
for
me
this
beer
means
alot
to
me
it
is
the
one
that
got
me
into
this
style
that
i
love
each
year
this
beer
seems
a
bit
different
some
times
for
the
better
other
times
a
bit
bland
a
wonderful
cooper
color
with
a
good
head
ah
the
malty
flavor
and
the
nutty
flavor
overall
a
very
malty
offering
per
style
not
the
most
depth
of
flavor
wish
there
had
been
a
little
more
complexity
o
least
favorite
from
the
sampler
pack
would
not
have
again
o
for
awhile
this
was
my
overall
favorite
beer
and
what
turned
me
on
to
maltleaning
beers
and
made
me
a
malt
guy
great
overall
and
really
puts
you
in
the
mood
for
the
fall
season
and
everything
that
comes
with
it
a
must
for
any
malt
fan
this
beer
pours
clear
dark
orange
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
somewhat
malty
but
fairly
plain
and
uninspiring
its
like
a
very
toned
down
part
of
the
taste
which
is
the
weak
part
of
the
beer
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
what
you
would
expect
out
of
an
oktoberfest
its
quite
malty
there
is
a
lot
of
crystal
and
munich
malt
flavors
and
has
a
lot
of
notes
of
toffee
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
nice
feel
this
beer
would
compliment
just
about
anything
perfectly
it
is
my
go
to
oktoberfest
and
one
of
sas
best
offerings
o
tasty
and
beautiful
form
of
a
wellknown
seasonal
well
balanced
and
alludes
to
the
rich
tastes
of
autumn
o
strangely
i
really
liked
this
two
years
ago
then
didnt
at
all
last
year
now
i
really
enjoyed
it
again
o
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
but
also
a
very
forgettable
one
as
well
mild
is
the
overall
theme
with
the
beer
so
nothing
is
particularly
memorable
or
especially
enjoyable
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
when
it
comes
to
mouthfeel
for
a
colder
weather
beer
but
a
tasty
brew
none
the
less
final
thoughts
not
one
of
samuel
adams
better
beers
but
not
bad
its
sort
of
in
that
grey
area
where
i
am
indifferent
to
it
i
could
see
a
first
time
craft
beer
drinker
really
liking
this
one
once
they
get
past
how
dark
it
is
compared
to
their
beloved
macrolager
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
not
out
of
place
in
the
autumn
sampler
pack
this
is
a
great
octoberfest
looks
pretty
standard
autumn
orange
color
with
a
lacey
off
white
head
that
lasts
awhile
smells
like
big
german
caramel
malts
and
bready
yeast
flavor
is
complex
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
so
many
octoberfests
are
i
pick
up
so
many
fall
flavors
in
this
like
pumpkins
squash
and
brown
sugar
but
that
may
just
be
a
product
of
the
season
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
the
style
its
lighter
in
body
but
not
thin
just
really
drinkable
carbonation
is
pretty
relaxed
in
this
its
one
of
those
beers
that
demands
a
huge
glass
letting
a
one
liter
draft
get
a
little
warm
as
it
drinks
is
how
i
always
wish
i
was
having
it
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
octoberfest
has
a
light
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
one
seasonal
that
you
can
drink
multiple
pints
and
not
get
sick
of
it
or
be
overpowered
by
gimmicky
seasonal
flavoring
overall
a
very
nice
brew
that
definitely
reminds
me
of
the
fall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
character
and
also
some
spice
and
hops
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
great
american
representation
of
the
marzen
style
i
will
definately
be
buying
again
overall
not
half
bad
one
of
the
better
beers
so
far
in
the
pack
much
better
than
the
dunkelweizen
for
sure
style
wise
still
not
much
of
a
fan
maybe
if
i
were
at
octoberfest
and
had
a
big
old
mug
of
it
and
a
brat
id
think
differently
im
sure
ill
make
it
over
there
one
of
these
years
not
one
to
go
back
to
despite
the
fit
for
the
season
over
all
the
beers
ok
i
really
like
octoberfests
and
this
one
is
easy
to
get
even
a
bit
early
definitely
not
my
first
pick
if
theres
better
oreally
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
although
there
are
some
better
examples
of
the
style
o
i
love
the
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
sweet
drinkable
beautiful
beer
overall
a
good
beer
to
buy
in
12
pack
cans
for
the
price
probably
what
i
call
your
average
marzen
not
complicated
a
little
to
metallic
but
certainly
a
good
deck
beer
on
the
weekend
a
decent
beer
for
autumn
i
wouldnt
be
super
anxious
waiting
for
this
to
come
out
every
august
through
october
but
its
an
average
beer
kind
of
a
red
amber
color
but
the
appearance
was
my
favorite
part
go
ahead
and
get
a
pack
or
two
for
your
friends
halloween
party
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
copper
with
a
biege
white
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
are
plentiful
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
theres
a
strong
roasted
barley
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
i
also
detect
some
mild
sweetness
and
grassy
hops
the
beer
is
very
bready
up
front
there
is
some
mild
sweetness
and
the
hops
bring
some
balance
on
the
back
end
the
aftertaste
is
also
pretty
malty
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
still
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
o
always
a
fan
of
octoberfest
a
little
early
in
the
release
by
sam
adams
but
the
summer
collection
has
been
getting
a
little
old
for
me
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
will
be
getting
a
lot
more
o
overall
this
is
an
above
average
octoberfest
beer
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
each
year
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
marzenoktoberfest
styles
and
the
sam
adams
product
i
think
is
a
quality
product
not
a
worldbeater
but
certainly
worth
a
drink
or
twelve
definitely
a
fun
beer
to
buy
a
bunch
of
sit
around
an
outdoor
fire
on
a
brisk
night
and
hang
out
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
thin
layer
of
suds
on
top
aroma
has
a
hint
of
bread
and
malt
taste
is
a
bit
thin
very
malty
with
toasted
and
roasted
malts
slight
earthy
bitterness
and
clean
finish
overall
a
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
find
fall
brew
to
go
with
your
bar
food
or
pizza
t
a
pretty
solid
rich
malty
flavor
throughout
with
some
almond
paste
slight
hop
bite
toasted
wheat
bread
and
some
buttered
toast
not
bad
at
all
overall
a
nice
change
up
from
my
steady
diet
of
hop
heavy
beers
i
know
fall
is
around
the
corner
when
i
start
seeing
this
beer
o
this
was
one
of
my
first
beers
from
the
boston
beer
company
that
i
tried
and
loved
i
look
forward
to
this
every
year
its
a
mellow
but
rich
beer
that
packs
loads
of
complex
flavors
that
are
well
mingled
together
and
very
refined
i
have
yet
to
try
many
oktoberfestmarzen
but
i
look
forward
to
expanding
my
horizon
until
then
old
sam
keeps
me
pretty
happy
o
every
year
this
beer
symbolizes
the
start
of
my
favorite
beer
season
its
a
great
go
to
beer
in
the
fall
and
one
i
look
forward
to
every
year
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
marzen
its
not
gonna
blow
you
away
but
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
quite
drinkable
certainly
one
i
dont
mind
seeing
from
year
to
year
in
the
fall
season

nutmeg

over

the

suggests
with

along
with

in

makes

want
another

to

think
this

needs

it

still
a

after
all
this
time
and
after
trying

many
other
examples
of
the

easily
accessible
too
this
is
a
good

beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
uclabrewn84oct
08
but
it
is
october
and
this
was
the
only
oktoberfest
beer
on
tap
at
my
local
restaurant
the
beer
was
served
on
tap
in
a
regular
pint
glass
not
even
the
sam
adams
special
glass
the
server
said
she
was
sorry
that
they
did
not
have
an
orange
slice
to
put
in
the
beer
i
dont
ever
recall
having
an
orange
in
an
oktoberfest
beer
so
i
told
her
that
was
alright
with
me
the
beer
looked
a
good
fall
amber
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
and
left
some
good
lacing
i
could
not
detect
any
distinct
smell
and
the
taste
was
more
malt
that
hops
the
carbonation
level
was
moderate
the
special
glass
would
have
made
more
bubbles
and
perhaps
more
flavor
a
good
beer
for
intellectual
wannabees
to
impress
their
friends

told
my

that
there
was
a
lightly
burnt
caramel
taste
this
kept
the
malt
flavor
from
being
sickly
sweet
i
also
detected
some
added
spices
a
slight
cinnamon
taste
mixed
with
some

in

so
at
the
moment
it
is
hard
to
say
where
it
ranks
i
would
try
it
again
rich

vibrant
lots
of

on

and
very
light
and
crisp

first
that

enough
flavor

beer
thoroghly
during
the
autumn
months
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
rich
dark
orange

color
its
a
clear
and
clean
looking
with
a
nice
looking
head
on
it
that
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the

has
a

it
out

much
more
than

often
seems
bland
and
watered
down
on

moving
to

then
fading
out
on

lots

the
problem
here
is
the
huge
diacetyl
presence
had
a
sixtel
of
this
on
at
my
house
for
about
2
weeks
and
really
tried
to
get
around
it
but
could
not
returned
it
for
a
keg
of
ramstein

and
this
is
much
better
a
friend
had
the
smae
issue
and
the
2
places
in
the
area
i
tried
it
on
tap
it
was
the
same
way
not
nearly
as
noticeable
in
bottles
question
is
is
this
lack
of
quality
control
at
certain
brewing
sites
i
believe
they
are
brewing
in
the
lehigh
valley
now
at
the
old
rolling
rock
place
but
not
sure
this
is
the
second
year
in
a
row

the
diacetly
presence
has
been

samuel

often

downgraded
by

of

geeks

for
being
little
more
than
a

stepping

between
mainstream
beer
and
craft
beer
i
chose
to
crack
my
first
one
today
because
for
the
first
time
it
feels
like
fall
outside
nothing
special

works
nicely
altogether

this
was
the
first
beer
that
got
me
into
craft

i
remember
just
wandering
into
my
local
grocery
store
and
seeing
it
and
thinking
what
the
heck
it
is
the
season
so
i
grabbed
it
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
it
has
lead
me
to
this
site
kind
of
coppery
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
finished
off
with
a
hoppy
finish
that
is
slight
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
bread
and
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
this
marzen
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
at
all

happend
to
this
beer
im
reviewing
this
in
the
fall
of
08
and
im
very
upset
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
years
ive
had
it
about
5
times
this
year
and
discussed
this
with
other
fans
and
we
agree
the
recipe
has
changed
as
recent
as
last
fall
the
lable
had
a
comment
something
about
being
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
well
i
dont
know
what
happend
but
those
hints
but
they
ar
gone
from
the
label
and
the
bottle
this
beer
is
moderatly
full
tasting
in
the
mouth
and
very
hoppy
this
beer
leaves
a
bat
taste
in
my
mouth
and
stomach
the
previous
version
was
4
5s
across
the
board
i
cant
even
drink
this
anymore
i
can
only
hope
next
year
its
better

im
not

it

in

i
always

a

aftertaste
the
octoberfest
i
had
on

last

did
not
display
the

it

of

tried
this
beer
at
barbecue
restaurant
in
midtown
that
just
put
it
on
draft
and
was
very
excited
unfortunately
i
was
unimpressed
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
but
the
aroma
was
bland
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
it
also
wasnt
special
at
all
or
what
i
was
expecting
therer
was
no
extra
matliness
or
hoppiness
it
was
as
if
they
took
regular
sam
adams
and
put
carmel
coloring
in
it
its
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
it
goes
down
easy
a
good
everyday
beer
but
definetely
not
a
specialty
beer
in
my
opinion

d
this
gets
the
same
reaction
as
most
other
brews
from
sa
decent
and
definitely
drinkable
but
hardly
as
good
as
other
craft
brewers
that
produce
on
a
smaller
scale
cheap
and
easily
accessible
but
not
noteworthy
dnot
bad
at
all
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
6er
i
do
however
prefer
a
sweeter
oktoberfest
brew
the
beer
looks
gorgeous
beautiful
orangered
body
with
initially
thick
head
that
thins
but
does
not
dissappear
smell
is
a
plethora
of
hops
yeast
and
wheat
some
caramellike
scent
there
too
very
flavorful
sweet
malty
and
yeasty
with
some
hop
bitterness
present
more
or
less
well
balanced
and
medium
bodied
a
very
decent
beer
definitely
among
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
ever
had
i
am
impressed
i
love
fall
beers
anyway
though
its
refined
it
has
finesse
its
remarkably
drinkable
there
are
other
more
fully
flavored
fests
out
there
but
im
not
sure
any
of
them
have
quite
the
same
quaffability
that
sammy
offers
prost
always
an
enjoyable
beer
i
manage
to
pick
it
up
at
least
once
or
twice
when
it
comes
out
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
in
previous
years
but
im
not
sure
this
years
is
for
me
its
pretty
enough
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
i
had
difficulty
with
the
aroma
as
in
it
wasnt
there
some
pumpkin
spice
some
sweetness
like
maple
syrup
very
subtle
ditto
for
the
taste
it
was
sweet
but
that
was
about
it
smooth
in
the
mouth
ive
had
half
of
the
6
pack
i
bought
maybe
ill
give
the
others
to
my
wife
note
i
picked
up
another
sixer
of
this
9907
and
im
convinced
that
while
its
a
great
session
beer
and
a
good
stab
at
one
of
my
favorite
styles
not
one
of
the
best
fest
biers
but
it
is
widely
available
and
cheap
this
is
an
autumn
staple
in
my
house
incidentally
i
first
spotted
this
beer
at
the
end
of
august
this
year
which
is
the
earliest
i
recall
as
i
normally
notice
its
arrival
sometime
in
september
no
complaints
here
though
none
at
all
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
a
thick
yet
light
in
consistency
head
some
lacing
throughout
the
smells
of
note
are
fruits
such
as
grape
and
plum
tastes
sweet
with
raisen
and
floral
essence
brown
sugar
and
caramel
notes
as
well
quite
smooth
on
the
pallate
but
i
couldnt
drink
this
consistently
because
of
the
sweetness
i
like
it
but
not
in
great
amounts
md
i
love
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
a
great
beer
that
is
easy
back
and
quite
smooth
a
great
transition
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
you
never
forget
your
first
this
beer
pours
a
deep
redcopper
color
with
a
creamy
dense
head
mildly
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
noble
hops
taste
follows
through
with
a
slightly
sweet
malty
palate
pleasantly
bready
along
with
earthy
spicy
leafy
hops
this
beer
finishes
grainier
on
the
dry
side
overall
quite
solid
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
goes
down
real
real
easy
one
of
the
better
beers
that
are
this
widely
available
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
beer
for
the
fall
very
reasonable
price
makes
this
beer
a
real
bargain
as
well
d
nice
light
easy
drinking
octoberfest
wont
offend
the
crowd
but
not
a
trip
back
down
memory
lane
again
any
time
soon
for
me
drinkability
pretty
high
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
sam
adams
lineup
didnt
meet
my
expectations
at
least
d
doesnt
touch
the
spaten
oktoberfest
it
is
alright
and
is
drinkable
but
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
d
good
but
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
samuel
adams
octoberfest
pours
a
nice
copper
colow
with
an
off
white
head
a
little
bit
of
hop
comes
through
in
the
aroma
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
dominate
hops
balance
this
out
and
are
somewhat
noticeable
toward
the
finish
but
remain
in
the
background
definitely
worth
a
try
love
most
sa
but
this
beer
while
very
quaffable
seems
to
be
for
the
bmc
crowd
who
want
an
octoberfest
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
color
with
a
one
inch
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
on
the
mug
head
seems
to
stay
the
entire
beer
smell
you
have
to
really
stick
your
nose
into
the
glass
and
take
a
big
wiff
to
at
least
smell
somthing
in
there
sweet
malt
small
with
a
bit
of
some
citrus
back
smell
as
well
taste
is
pretty
good
this
goes
down
very
smooth
has
a
bit
to
much
carbonation
but
not
over
bearing
i
can
taste
the
malts
that
are
used
kind
of
soft
and
mellow
this
is
a
good
offering
but
not
to
tasty
mouthfeel
crisp
could
be
a
little
crisper
but
it
goes
down
really
easily
sessionable
beer
nice
orangish
brown
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
like
carmel
i
can
also
detect
smells
of
bread
the
taste
is
of
sweet
carmel
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
orange
peel
nicely
carbonated
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
as
the
weather
cools
just
a
bit
good
effort
by
boston
beer
company
a
bit
better
on
tap
imo
i
drank
it
out
out
of
a
pint
glass
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
its
taste
the
color
is
intriguing
pours
the
color
that
everyone
else
has
said
orangeamber
combination
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
so
im
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
it
does
taste
a
bit
weak
if
that
makes
sense
not
watery
in
the
sense
of
a
macro
but
it
could
definitely
use
a
stronger
presense
but
what
taste
is
there
is
good
like
many
other
have
said
i
wouldnt
go
way
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
and
does
taste
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
which
could
be
much
better
with
some
improvements
boston
beer
company
seems
to
gently
improve
their
oktoberfest
formula
each
year
could
see
myself
drinking
drinking
this
beer
quite
a
bit
as
fall
draws
nearer
will
just
need
to
stock
up
before
it
sells
out
again
pours
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
nice
creawmy
head
aroma
is
all
malt
with
some
caramel
notes
as
well
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
wierd
lingering
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
chewy
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
thin
lacy
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
nice
pleasant
smell
of
cinnamon
and
other
spicy
aromas
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
taste
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
the
only
drawback
is
a
metalliclike
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
mainly
is
brought
about
by
the
carbonation
that
is
pleasant
but
feels
like
something
is
lacking
a
relatively
drinkable
brew
but
if
looking
for
a
session
i
would
choose
another
a
decent
brew
but
sam
adams
is
capable
of
better
pours
copper
color
with
a
thin
film
of
head
smells
malty
taste
is
carmel
like
malts
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
medium
body
and
carbonation
like
most
sam
adams
beers
it
needs
more
of
everything
but
this
isnt
bad
i
could
drink
several
of
these
its
an
enjoyable
beer
just
not
as
flavorful
as
many
of
the
german
imports
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
the
beer
was
dark
brown
in
color
and
was
not
over
carbonated
it
smelled
and
tasted
really
good
i
recommend
this
beer
12

glass
lovely
clear
orangered

moderate
head
about

smell
is
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
taste
is
very
sweet
with
the
malt
but
still
the
hops
balances
to
not
make
it
overly
sweet
a
bit
of
spice
sort
of
like
ginger
finishes
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
body
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tastey
beer
though
its
not
a
style
i
think
i
would
want
a
whole
lot
of
at
once
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
good
flavor
and
nice
smell
flavor
seems
a
bit
low
in
the
malt
department
though
considering
how
available
this
is
its
certainly
something
to
try
im
sure
ill
get
this
a
few
more
times
while
its
in
season
overall
this
is
nicely
done
an
oktoberfest
which
is
equal
parts
accessible
and
hearty
id
recommend
it
this
years
samuel
adams
octoberfest
is
outstanding
and
without
question
the
best
of
show
for
this
style
ive
yet
tried
theres
nothing
like
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
we
start
off
witht
he
pour
deep
gold
almost
orange
the
head
dissapears
quickly
i
get
some
spice
on
the
nose
as
well
as
malt
and
a
tiny
amount
of
hops
theres
also
a
little
breadyness
there
too
when
i
taste
this
i
get
the
breadyness
again
with
some
malty
sweetness
theres
a
kind
of
fruityness
to
it
as
well
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
spice
this
doesnt
finish
clean
theres
a
viscosity
that
lingers
that
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
oktoberfests
out
there
leave
this
one
to
the
germans
ok
d
its
not
terribly
refreshing
so
a
chilly
fall
day
is
about
the
only
time
this
sounds
appealing
to
me
but
it
is
certainly
appealing
and
ill
make
my
way
through
most
of
this
sixpack
today
while
it
stays
in
the
mid
to
high
60s
six
months
past
the
expiration
date
but
still
pumpkiny
squashy
and
gooey
butter
rum
tasty
feels
like
autumn
and
in
my
manheart
its
leaves
falling
and
old
men
smoking
pipe
tobacco
at
the
fishing
docks
wondering
where
summer
went
theres
crisp
air
and
scraping
sounds
on
sidewalks
in
here
light
sweaters
and
argyle
socks
sundown
at
sixthirtyfive
and
stew
with
bread
other
than
the
c
in
octoberfest
this
plays
by
the
rules
and
gets
top
grades
no
dunce
cap
or
reasons
to
send
in
the
gendarmes
for
thee
medium
body
with
a
tang
that
smooths
out
in
the
mouthfeel
department
easy
to
drink
and
suites
its
style
just
fine
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
sam
does
a
good
job
capturing
bostons
fall
in
a
bottle
now
id
prefer
something
like
smuttynose
pumpkin
or
ipswich
harvest
but
its
a
very
workable
fall
brew
this
beer
is
not
a
style
i
have
had
many
of
but
i
was
expecting
much
differemt
this
aint
too
bad
the
beer
is
about
the
color
of
sweet
tea
this
is
a
very
autumnlike
color
even
though
it
is
currrently
march
a
aggressive
pour
resulted
in
a
thick
head
that
has
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
kindly
set
you
back
a
little
it
is
a
bit
strong
the
taste
is
of
spices
this
is
an
exceptionly
smooth
beer
i
could
drink
these
in
a
session
i
overlooked
this
beer
last
fall
for
reasons
unknown
but
i
will
not
overlook
it
again
this
fall
a
good
beer
that
suprised
me
overall
a
very
average
octoberfest
worthy
to
try
but
they
are
better
offerings
out
there
drinkability
a
fine
beer
with
no
aftertaste
makes
this
a
delight
cant
wait
to
finish
the
rest
of
my
6pack
d
extremely
drinkable
beer
great
session

its

i
could
definitly
drink
plenty
of
these
and
feel
very
good
the
pour
was
of
an
orange
amber
hue
the
appearance
is
one
of
golden
orange
with
a
touch
of
maroonish
haze
color
the
smell
was
rich
with
spice
and
wheat
with
a
strong
undertone
of
herbs
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
where
both
very
very
nice
filled
with
flavor
with
no
hint
of
bitterness
my
overall
impression
was
excellent
go
buy
some
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
oktoberfests
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
with
off
white
foam
sweet
candy
aroma
with
some
bready
malt
and
slight
fruitiness
sweet
caramelly
and
malty
finish
is
clean
and
dry
pretty
good
drinkability
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
decent
ofest
i
enjoyed
it
it
strikes
me
as
a
great
session
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
do
some
crushing
this
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
color
which
seemed
to
glow
it
was
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
tight
and
compact
off
white
cream
in
color
and
about
1
12
inches
thick
and
well
lasting
there
was
a
nice
sheety
lace
left
behind
that
lasted
to
the
end
of
the
glass
the
aromas
were
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
thought
and
liked
but
noticable
and
pleasing
i
nosed
lots
of
rich
and
sweet
malts
spices
and
some
light
hops
the
tastes
were
more
pronounced
ton
of
mixing
malts
and
spices
from
sweet
malts
to
rich
malts
and
defined
spices
caramels
and
some
notes
of
dark
fruit
as
it
warmed
hints
of
hops
mostly
a
spicey
hop
but
slight
floral
became
noticable
as
it
warmed
swirled
in
and
out
near
the
middle
and
end
of
the
swallow
and
turned
to
a
dry
hop
flavor
as
a
last
taste
down
the
throat
some
malty
aftertaste
and
dry
hops
were
left
the
body
was
light
medium
not
as
thick
compared
to
others
of
this
style
i
have
had
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
every
year
i
cannot
believe
i
havent
rated
this
yet
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
a
couple
of
years
now
my
wife
likes
this
that
is
the
main
reason
i
buy
it
and
so
do
i
good
session
beer
from
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
amber
with
off
white
head
aroma
a
nice
maltlyness
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
hops
flavor
malts
toffee
caramel
hops
like
the
bitterness
the
hops
give
this
another
good
beer
from
s
a
drinkability

very
drinkable
not
too
complex
i
think
easy
going
down
smell
is
grain
and
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
a
bit
grassy
and
toasty
slight
hop
flavor
with
bitterness
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
other
oktoberfests
more
but
its
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
remarkable
its
got
a
nice
little
creamy
head
on
it
that
has
some
retention
but
not
too
much
the
taste
is
definately
a
bit
better
this
year
with
a
more
abundance
of
caramel
roasted
malts
and
some
light
fruits
intertwined
the
past
few
years
for
this
beer
have
been
rather
hohum
with
faintness
abound
overall
this
years
brew
of
oktoberfest
is
definately
a
great
step
in
the
right
direction
opinion
well
its
not
contaminated
or
anything
this
is
not
what
i
would
call
an
octoberfest
beer
it
is
more
of
a
cross
between
a
northern
pilsner
hop
presence
in
flavor
and
a
mild
munich
dunkel
light
bittering
hops
for
finish
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
it
is
rather
uneventful
and
disappointing
in
the
malt
aspects
the
hops
are
too
aggressive
to
i
guess
try
and
make
up
for
the
lack
of
malt
its
ok
just
not
to
style
toasty
biscuity
nose
toasty

carmel
right
up

sam

octoberfest
is
a
staple
session
beer
for
me
in
the
fall
you
can
find
it
everywhere
and
it
is
usually
on
sale
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
orangered
with
a
slightly
tan
head
that
is
fairly
large
and
fluffy
at
first
but
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
coating
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
with
some
caramel
notes
and
a
twinge
of
spicy
hops
flavor
is
very
malty
and
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
with
some
nutty
flavors
as
well
slightly
cloying
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
hops
all
in
all
a
solid
fall
seasonal
and
a
good
session
beer
first
time
i
have
tried
an
octoberfest
beer
pours
a
nice
redorange
color
and
leaves
basically
no
lacing
has
a
good
caramel
smell
it
has
a
toasty
malty
caramel
taste
with
a
subtle
bitterness
and
is
well
balanced
finishes
somewhat
dry
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
because
it
is
easy
drinking
a
good
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
others
of
this
style
i
figured
this
one
wouldnt
be
on
draft
too
much
longer
and
the
choices
werent
too
tempting
anyway
so
why
not
this
octoberfest
is
worth
trying
but
nothing
to
rave
about
nice
copper
orange
color
with
a
small
head
and
lacing
a
nice
bit
of
spiciness
reminds
me
their
winter
warmer
that
will
be
showing
up
soon
a
much
better
choice
this
one
took
me
a
while
to
finish
im
not
too
big
a
fan
of
this
style
anyway
pours
a
deep
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
head
little
lacing
is
left
behind
but
the
head
disappates
fairly
rapidly
malty
aroma
that
is
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
the
balance
is
thrown
a
little
towards
the
malty
side
however
the
hops
are
still
noticable
slightly
dry
bitter
mouthfeel
keeps
this
from
being
an
outstanding
session
brew
i
always
look
forward
to
this
brew
when
the
fall
season
comes
rolling
around
dsam
adams
octoberfest
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
toasty
finish
not
overly
strong
based
on
the
mild
hops
which
allows
one
to
get
through
a
six
pack
though
for
some
the
malt
flavor
may
be
a
drawback
after
a
couple
of
beers
after
a
few
it
may
come
across
as
fairly
heavy
nevertheless
it
is
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
for
the
price
in
my
opinion
granted
i
got
this
bottle
from
a
buddy
of
mine
apparently
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
bought
up
pretty
fast
in
my
area
just
another
testament
to
its
own
drinkability
drinkability
well
balanced
and
very
pleasant
clean
maltiness
balanced
with
spicy
flavors
make
this
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
drinkable
and
some
taste
from
roast
sam
adams
to
me
is
positioned
as
a
transition
from
macro
to
craft
beer
bit
of
hop
bitterness
even
sourness
leading
to
some
fruit
juice
in
finish
well
malted
and
suitably
carbonated
no
colour
and
thin
mouthfeel
thanks
to
jason
for
sharing
this
bottle
pours
a
medium
reddish
amber
with
very
little
carbonation
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
maltiness
caramel
the
slightest
of
hops
is
there
very
gentle
wafting
through
the
dominant
malts
the
flavor
follows
through
and
i
believe
the
best
desription
is
tha
flavors
of
kings
hawaiian
bread
and
thats
a
compliment
i
love
that
bread
its
moderately
dense
sweet
and
chewy
the
bread
that
is
but
its
also
a
pretty
good
description
of
this
beer
pretty
simple
in
its
composition
im
not
spending
much
time
trying
figure
out
what
that
flavor
is
halfway
through
the
swallow
real
basic
i
like
it
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
on
a
cool
night
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
get
it
again
but
i
think
it
could
be
so
much
more
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
good
but
there
arent
enough
of
them
present
it
would
be
a
really
good
session
beer
recommended
with
reservations
i
guess
this
is
ok
if
nothing
else
is
available
better
than
going
macro
in
any
case
overall
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
to
get
if
you
cant
find
anything
else
nothing
special
here
but
at
the
same
time
not
disappointing
either
if
youre
trying
to
convert
some
of
your
friends
to
craft
beers
this
is
a
good
one
to
use
as
an
intro
to
the
style
overall
if
you
want
a
very
easy
to
drink
fest
this
is
it
however
youre
not
getting
anything
exciting
imo
and
it
is
rather
disappointing
i
actually
love
sam
adams
brews
but
this
one
is
lacking
almost
all
around
a
shame
really
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
a
nice
seasonal
and
a
good
beer
to
introduce
folks
to
a
new
style
imo
this
is
boring
drinkable
but
definitely
boring
the
smell
is
kind
of
weak
with
just
a
bit
of
a
malty
smell
and
a
slight
hint
of
spicy
hops
it
really
does
taste
like
a
bit
stronger
and
more
bitter
version
of
the
boston
lager
the
hops
have
a
bit
of
a
nice
spicy
bite
but
there
isnt
really
much
of
a
malt
backbone
which
i
thought
was
part
of
the
märzen
style
id
take
a
märzhon
or
an
old
dominion
octoberfest
over
this
any
day
a
decent
pour
head
rises
to
one
finger
and
dissipates
very
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
the
glass
is
left
looking
freshly
washed
color
is
a
beautiful
redamber
smell
is
faint
sweet
camelized
malt
and
faint
hops
the
taste
is
nice
sweet
with
a
mild
hop
finish
the
carbonation
bites
a
little
on
this
one
maybe
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
decent
not
overly
full
more
watery
than
i
would
have
thought
this
one
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
in
quantity
and
will
be
fun
to
take
to
a
gathering
this
weekend
nice
and
something
different
for
the
season
guess
id
better
start
reviewing
all
the
various
oktoberfest
beers
at
my
local
distributor
before
they
disappear
sams
offering
has
a
terrific
rich
reddish
amber
color
and
a
respectable
head
that
had
some
staying
power
for
me
the
smell
was
a
little
too
sweet
but
also
has
more
of
a
malty
backing
instead
of
grainy
which
is
a
plus
the
taste
is
strong
and
bitey
but
not
overpowering
a
quality
hop
count
is
present
and
accounted
for
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
specimen
its
nice
to
know
sam
can
still
make
a
quality
product
when
he
wants
to
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
small
frothy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
film
lacing
is
initially
large
but
does
not
have
the
staying
power
as
it
slides
back
down
to
beer
level
before
your
next
sip
the
smell
is
maltdominant
and
sweet
with
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
grass
and
a
light
fruitiness
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
malts
taking
centre
stage
hrm
it
starts
out
with
a
nice
chewy
malt
flavor
supported
by
a
light
herbal
bitterness
but
it
turns
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
a
little
honey
and
savory
show
up
briefly
the
slightly
bitter
finish
is
below
average
with
very
little
appealing
flavors
lingering
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
one
its
not
bad
but
ive
had
several
better
this
year
doubt
ill
get
this
one
again
overall
a
veery
good
interpretation
of
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
lacking
in
hop
character
for
my
taste
but
still
something
i
will
probably
buy
at
least
a
sixer
of
each
year
overall
drinkability
is
fairly
low
for
i
really
dont
like
it
all
that
much
and
find
myself
wishing
that
i
had
something
a
little
better
sam
adams
can
be
very
hitormiss
on
their
beers
and
for
me
this
one
is
a
definite
miss
even
if
its
only
a
slight
one
its
decent
enough
to
drink
if
its
about
the
only
thing
available
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
buy
another
sixer
of
these
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
octoberfest
dry
enough
to
distinguish
itself
from
the
sometimes
confusing
amber
style
and
enough
of
a
malt
presence
to
stand
next
to
the
best
of
them
good
interpretation
of
a
delicate
and
easy
to
foulup
style
mouthfeel
very
good
and
refreshing
medium
body
it
is
just
meaty
enough
to
feel
like
a
real
beer
while
staying
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
poured
dark
amber
with
nice
clarity
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
is
creamy
and
shows
excellent
retention
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
leaving
good
sticky
lacing
roasted
malt
and
cascade
hop
aromas
sweet
roasted
flavor
caramel
and
a
balanced
hop
pressence
that
carry
over
into
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
finishes
with
some
residual
sweetness
but
quite
drinkable
nothing
spectacular
but
the
bitterness
and
malt
flavor
are
right
on
for
an
ofest
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
orangeamber
color
with
an
impressive
white
head
that
lingers
down
to
the
last
drop
it
leaves
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
pleasant
but
mild
the
only
other
festmarzen
beer
i
have
tried
is
the
weeping
radish
fest
amber
lager
the
sam
adams
is
much
more
full
bodied
although
still
a
fairly
light
beer
this
beer
tastes
better
than
the
fest
and
does
not
leave
the
metallic
aftertaste
i
noticed
with
the
fest
light
beer
good
taste
good
mouthfeel
no
unusual
aftertaste
sounds
like
something
i
could
deal
with
in
mass
quantities
i
would
order
this
one
at
an
oktoberfest
and
look
forward
to
finishing
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
all
in
all
a
good
beer
i
had
a
chance
to
sample
this
one
in
the
bottle
and
compare
to
spaten
and
paulaner
oktoberfests
in
the
keg
jim
koch
is
my
hero
although
i
would
choose
the
german
oktoberfests
given
the
choice
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
if
i
could
brew
and
oktoberfest
this
good
i
dont
think
id
ever
leave
the
house
i
wont
bore
you
with
the
details
about
appearence
and
flavor
as
others
have
posted
good
specifics
but
i
will
say
you
should
go
out
and
buy
a
sixer
before
they
are
gone
for
the
season
d
this
beer
has
a
light
smooth
maltyness
that
i
wish
was
stronger
the
hops
are
in
balance
but
to
faint
because
the
malt
is
rather
faint
drinkability
absolutely
im
a
sucker
for
sammy
a
so
even
though
it
wasnt
everything
i
hoped
for
im
still
going
back
for
more
final
thought
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
would
rather
pay
the
same
amount
for
the
boston
lager
but
the
varietyseasonal
quality
will
always
get
me
back
to
this
one
every
year
nice
deep
ambercopper
color
was
topped
by
a
thin
head
that
left
zero
lacing
nice
malty
aroma
with
some
hop
wafting
up
from
the
glass
much
more
aromatic
than
most
lager
types
solid
malty
taste
and
the
golding
hops
shine
through
good
food
beer
too
smooth
ful
bodied
but
not
thickish
refreshing
as
a
lager
should
be
sam
adams
might
have
become
a
macromicro
but
one
thing
is
assured
one
is
always
assured
of
a
decent
beer
clear
orangeamber
with
a
creamy
mediumsized
pale
oatmealcolored
head
smells
very
nice
with
a
fresh
continental
hopping
that
breathes
forth
pine
needles
and
leafy
metallic
dust
flavor
is
doughy
caramel
in
a
mediumthick
body
bubbles
are
a
little
too
present
but
as
with
most
beers
the
longer
it
sits
the
smoother
it
gets
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
i
find
that
it
drinks
too
thick
and
filling
for
most
occasions
this
review
was
on
a
bottle
ive
had
some
on
tap
here
in
stl
even
more
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
sticks
to
the
teeth
and
tongue
a
bit
quite
drinkable
i
would
buy
another
sixer
of
this
later
this
year
during
halloween
trickortreating
or
something
fairly
dark
amber
colour
in
the
glass
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
in
the
glass
sweet
aroma
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruitiness
flavour
is
also
slightly
sweet
with
mostly
malt
flavours
finishes
with
a
very
slight
dry
hop
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
fest
beers
this
season
drinkability
very
drinkable
an
octoberfest
that
should
not
offend
bmc
guy
yet
should
have
enough
taste
to
satisfy
the
serious
micro
drinker
i
liked
this
i
could
definitely
go
for
more
easy
enough
to
drink
as
a
session
brew
but
would
match
up
nicely
with
a
burger
or
brat
mouthfeel
is
an
okay
blend
of
a
sweet
sour
mix
with
a
medium
bodied
feel
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
seasonal
appropriate
for
october
and
always
superior
to
the
typical
fare
offered
at
most
bars
in
my
area
always
a
treat
to
see
this
one
on
tap
just
like
all
sa
beers
much
better
from
a
keg
great
session
brew
for
a
long
autumns
night
around
a
fire
dated
by
feb
06
also
noticed
it
sez
lager
on
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
small
head
but
lots
of
lacing
scent
of
sweet
malts
medium
body
very
nice
taste
kinda
sweet
man
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
very
nice
again
by
sam
adams
highly
recommended
a
pretty
darn
good
tasting
oktoberfest
this
is
probably
my
last
until
next
fall
yeah
right
refreshing
drinkable
pours
the
usual
amber
color
slight
head
retention
smell
is
funky
old
beer
smell
taste
follows
that
but
with
a
hop
bite
i
thought
fest
beers
were
supposed
to
be
malty
not
hoppy
it
seems
like
they
left
out
the
malt
flavors
here
its
not
bad
overall
just
not
very
good
cheers
drinkability
its
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
and
that
detracts
from
my
desire
to
have
another
overall
worth
checking
out
for
a
seasonal
beer
but
not
something
id
pick
up
every
day
there
are
better
oktoberfests
out
there
such
as
new
glarus
staghorn
oktoberfest
having
said
that
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
mmmm
the
taste
is
truly
fantastic
lots
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
yeast
flavours
and
a
touch
of
hops
throw
in
the
price
tag
which
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
is
pratically
free
and
im
drinkin
this
beer
everyday
until
winter
comes
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
mixed
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
taste
is
very
strong
on
toasted
malt
i
also
detect
a
dark
fruitiness
that
is
enjoyable
finished
in
a
nonspectactular
fashion
with
heavy
malt
and
a
light
hoppiness
this
is
a
good
session
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
was
not
overly
impressive
after
neatly
six
years
of
finding
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
near
revolting
i
found
it
tapped
and
pleasant
crystalline
orangeamber
color
with
a
nearwhite
frothy
head
that
faded
slowly
laced
evenly
and
well
just
barely
malting
on
the
nose
with
some
oat
bread
mixed
in
light
but
pleasant
smell
same
on
the
tongue
but
a
bit
stronger
with
a
slight
hop
on
the
finish
very
smooth
but
not
at
all
thing
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
it
mustve
been
drinkable
because
it
was
gone
every
time
you
looked
for
it
finish
is
bold
broad
and
flavorful
this
beer
left
me
with
my
tastebuds
in
an
uproar
and
a
longlasting
aftertaste
that
was
about
as
good
as
any
part
of
the
beer
itself
generally
speaking
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
and
will
probably
try
again
to
me
it
was
just
a
little
bit
like
and
ipa
without
the
incredible
hop
bitters
so
yeah
i
could
see
buying
this
and
having
a
few
however
i
dont
really
buy
sammy
beers
because
of
the
average
flavors
and
for
the
price
there
are
punchier
beers
out
there
i
bought
this
in
a
sampler
and
bought
a
6
of
christien
moerleins
hefe
see
that
review
for
that
review
overall
nice
if
youre
looking
for
somethign
toasty
but
not
as
wellbalanced
as
it
could
be
drinkability
and
overall
while
its
not
the
best
this
is
a
tasty
oktoberfest
full
of
character
and
drinkability
if
only
the
hops
were
more
prominent
id
be
drinking
this
beer
all
season
but
still
its
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
give
it
a
shot
eh
not
a
bad
brew
inoffensive
appealing
to
the
masses
itll
do
in
a
pinch
overall
a
bland
offering
looks
and
acts
like
a
regular
sam
adams
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
fine
amount
of
foam
and
lacing
smells
sweet
malty
sip
is
smooth
and
rich
with
a
good
mouthfeel
hops
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
when
sipping
though
they
dont
really
have
a
distinct
profile
taste
then
turns
strongly
to
a
malty
caramel
flavor
that
works
wel
for
the
style
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
offensive
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
really
have
that
typical
sam
adams
taste
noble
hops
which
is
a
slight
disappointment
for
me
nevertheless
a
great
beer
for
the
season
to
mix
up
in
ones
usual
beer
rotation
bottle
obtained
from
meridian
wine
spirits
lafayette
colorado
and
consumed
later
that
same
evening
pours
a
1
5
finger
dirty
tan
head
that
hangs
like
tom
dooley
the
beer
is
rich
orangerust
and
crystal
clear
smells
reich
caramel
sweet
malty
during
the
pour
to
the
nose
crisp
rich
grains
sugar
careml
and
some
munich
malt
tin
hops
maybe
saaz
toasted
grains
smells
yummy
and
looks
yummy
tastes
caramel
toasty
grains
with
some
apricot
thats
a
flavor
that
doesnt
belong
sweet
and
a
hint
of
sour
grains
sweet
in
the
mouth
but
a
dry
finish
i
dont
care
for
the
high
carbonation
it
makes
the
beer
leave
the
tongue
too
soon
after
swirling
to
release
carb
the
head
which
had
disappeared
returns
in
its
full
glory
the
beer
tastes
much
better
now
a
sweet
yet
sour
grain
hangs
like
a
thick
dark
cloud
near
my
tonsils
yeah
it
keeps
some
of
the
toasty
beer
flavor
around
hmmm
i
wonder
if
that
flavor
could
be
some
floral
from
hops
yes
now
i
think
it
might
be
not
saaz
though
tettnanger
maybe
hallertauer
i
think
not
smooth
slick
mouthfeel
thank
goodness
i
got
rid
of
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
so
so
the
dry
gets
to
me
by
the
end
and
the
toasty
becomes
a
bit
too
tannic
or
phenolic
very
enjoyable
with
many
qualities
that
remond
me
of
the
beers
i
had
in
germany
last
year
poured
a
wonderfully
rich
copper
color
and
created
an
expanding
foamy
tan
head
streams
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
with
flecks
of
lacing
as
well
malty
aromas
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
hops
as
well
good
strong
hoppy
start
in
taste
this
yields
to
a
bready
malt
which
spreads
over
the
tongue
leaving
a
gingerbread
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
balanced
with
a
good
coating
but
too
much
carbonation
a
great
fall
beer
this
is
solid
entry
into
theimhoovercrowded
oktoberfest
market
its
a
vibrant
strong
copper
color
with
ample
head
the
taste
has
a
sweet
and
prominent
malt
flavor
with
hops
that
nicely
balance
things
there
are
some
nice
hints
of
fruit
the
beer
is
well
made
and
retains
its
flavor
well
being
as
drinkable
on
the
cold
first
sip
as
it
is
on
the
moderately
warmed
final
sip
if
its
that
time
of
year
hell
grab
one
join
the
spirit
of
the
season
but
like
i
said
grab
one
not
a
whole
case
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
reddishamber
color
with
betterthanaverage
lacing
it
smells
and
tastes
biscuity
and
malty
with
the
taste
having
just
a
hint
of
cherry
and
mustiness
with
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
and
very
little
bitterness
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
perhaps
the
most
sessionable
of
the
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
year
but
seems
to
be
pandering
a
bit
i
picked
this
one
up
at
buffalow
wild
wings
and
loved
it
it
pours
a
very
nice
clear
amber
and
the
head
is
a
beautiful
frothy
cream
colored
head
very
smooth
for
sure
and
very
drinkable
its
has
some
sweet
notes
and
a
little
spice
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
will
definatly
savor
this
one
this
year
i
could
be
totally
wrong
about
the
munich
malt
but
after
some
feedback
from
the
forum
im
pretty
sure
ive
locked
that
down
to
the
root
fo
the
problem
boring
served
on
tap
into
a
tumbler
style
pint
glass
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
sweet
malty
aroma
neither
appealing
nor
unappealing
fizzy
carbonation
taste
is
very
sweet
but
unexciting
slight
hoppiness
very
bland
though
octoberfest
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
ive
never
found
any
of
the
of
beers
ive
had
to
be
very
complex
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
simply
ok
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
first
oktoberfest
beer
i
think
it
is
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
but
is
somewhat
plain
but
i
would
drink
it
again
makes
for
a
nice
lager
though
this
was
served
with
a
thin
head
that
didnt
last
long
quite
clear
medium
amberorange
colour
there
was
plenty
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
but
not
much
malty
depth
and
little
in
the
way
of
hops
low
bitterness
lots
of
sweetness
and
this
carries
straight
through
to
the
end
a
bit
grainy
with
some
corn
flavour
thrown
in
not
very
clean
tasting
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
at
the
midpoint
the
body
fell
away
and
became
thin
towards
the
finish
but
still
had
some
stickiness
a
bit
disappointing
poured
out
to
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
12
inch
white
foam
head
higher
carbonation
noted
in
this
beer
some
lace
rings
after
half
the
glass
was
empty
odors
of
yeast
caramel
and
malt
taste
could
have
been
stronger
but
nonetheless
good
flavors
of
hops
grain
and
some
spice
were
evenly
meshed
by
the
slightly
smooth
bitterness
toward
the
end
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
was
more
than
acceptable
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
season
just
wish
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
worth
a
try
meh
this
is
a
decent
offering
if
nothing
else
its
gotten
me
in
the
mood
for
the
better
ofests
that
should
be
popping
up
soon
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
but
this
could
be
a
halfway
decent
session
brew
pairing
it
with
the
right
food
would
help
this
one
a
lot
allow
multiple
drinks
to
get
progressively
warmer
the
sweetness
is
nice
but
overpowering
after
2
or
3
and
the
warmer
beer
tempers
that
a
little
creamy
smooth
and
drinkable
very
nice
for
a
cool
fall
day
overall
to
start
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
id
like
to
review
this
again
from
the
bottle
to
see
if
any
of
the
negatives
were
from
the
restaurant
or
the
tap
the
buttery
and
metallic
flavors
made
this
hard
to
tolerate
and
they
arent
normal
for
this
style
better
luck
next
time
a
hair
below
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
body
and
somewhat
grainy
texture
im
not
impressed
with
this
but
have
found
that
sam
adams
octoberfest
varies
wildly
by
the
year
2005
doesnt
seem
a
good
year
but
who
knows
what
2006
will
bring
samuel
adams
octoberfest
pours
to
a
brownishamber
color
with
a
huge
head
formation
and
a
generous
stream
of
carbonation
that
cascades
up
the
glass
the
nose
is
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
the
palate
even
more
laden
with
those
nuttymalty
melanoidin
flavors
imparted
by
the
munich
malt
theres
a
touch
of
chocolate
too
a
slightly
thinner
than
desired
body
and
a
finish
that
is
balanced
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
this
is
actually
a
very
good
octoberfest
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
adams
beers
i
look
forward
to
its
release
every
september
a
fair
attempt
for
an
oktoberfest
but
it
cannot
compare
to
traditional
german
brews
looks
brightly
copperorange
vigorously
carbonated
fizzy
head
retention
aromas
are
modestly
of
the
bready
toasty
creamy
and
crisp
character
that
i
like
in
oktoberfests
tastes
much
the
same
modest
malt
character
not
biscuit
malt
has
a
grain
husk
flavor
with
mild
astringency
lacking
hop
character
of
the
noble
variety
creaminess
and
cleanliness
is
not
to
the
calaber
of
true
oktoberfest
beers
although
the
characters
are
lacking
and
despite
a
few
flaws
its
still
a
fair
beer
although
i
still
get
excited
when
i
see
this
on
shelvesits
just
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
i
like
the
appearencebut
the
smell
is
not
what
you
would
find
in
traditional
octoberfests
to
me
i
find
all
sam
adams
alittle
too
big
brewery
for
mebut
this
octoberfest
has
a
great
after
taste
very
festive
and
fall
like
cheers
overall
impression
very
very
drinkable
not
the
most
exciting
octoberfest
out
there
but
im
always
glad
to
see
it
offered
at
many
bars
this
time
of
year
served
at
my
wedding
as
a
session
brew
along
with
sierra
nevada
pale
i
found
it
to
have
a
solid
appearance
big
frothy
off
white
head
like
a
swiss
coffee
type
color
and
a
dark
amber
malted
looking
body
smelled
a
deeep
sweet
malt
flavor
and
the
taste
was
similair
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
was
popular
at
the
event
so
it
served
its
purpose
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
lacking
any
bold
or
zippy
qualities
obviously
it
was
highly
drinkable
because
it
was
the
second
most
popular
brew
served
at
the
event
if
your
looking
for
an
average
example
of
the
style
that
is
easily
consumed
this
is
it
its
flavor
is
dominated
by
maltiness
but
also
has
a
nutty
characteristic
with
a
bit
of
bready
flavor
as
well
light
in
the
mouth
feel
department
but
generously
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
its
good
to
enjoy
with
meals
or
to
just
have
it
with
a
snack
or
all
by
itself
sam
adams
does
it
again
i
could
see
where
the
light
weight
of
this
beer
could
make
it
more
drinkable
to
some
but
there
just
isnt
enough
flavor
to
encourage
me
to
open
another
the
body
is
a
good
neutral
not
overpowering
not
too
light
one
thing
i
would
like
to
see
is
less
spice
in
the
beer
that
said
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
that
i
have
had
notes
its
not
bad
its
just
a
very
clean
and
malty
lager
with
little
hop
flavor
and
aroma
i
like
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
but
nothing
else
wows
you
hmmm
not
as
good
as
i
remebered
maybe
my
palate
has
gotten
a
little
picky
over
the
past
year
but
theres
something
a
little
off
with
this
beer
it
basically
just
tasted
like
a
sweetened
lager
a
small
nutty
character
but
a
waytoopresent
metalic
taste
that
really
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
maybe
im
wrong
but
this
just
seems
like
a
halfassed
beer
from
a
generally
solid
company
look
forward
to
this
beermakes
the
end
of
summer
more
bearable
tried
this
seasons
both
on
draft
and
bottle
and
was
pleased
with
its
annual
consistencyvery
authenic
oktoberfest
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
delivered
lots
of
flavormostly
malty
light
caramel
and
somewhat
dry
on
the
finish
some
oct
fest
beers
are
a
little
more
hoppy
but
this
one
is
very
tasty
and
pleasing
acts
as
a
wonderful
transition
beer
from
summer
to
winter
this
poured
a
dark
amber
copper
orange
with
a
pepsitype
carbinated
head
the
head
quickly
dissappeared
and
left
no
lace
the
aroma
if
there
was
any
was
of
toast
caramel
and
a
background
of
hops
but
i
had
to
look
for
the
aroma
it
wasnt
strong
at
all
the
taste
was
of
light
malt
caramel
toast
and
grape
nuts
there
were
hops
in
the
background
but
oddly
it
kinda
balanced
everything
out
the
downfall
is
that
the
flavor
just
tastes
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
large
bubbles
made
it
harsh
on
the
pallete
and
it
left
a
gummy
feeliing
after
wards
its
an
ok
octoberfest
but
not
the
best
deep
amber
brownish
color
with
average
head
and
lacing
smell
is
bready
doughy
malt
with
a
bit
of
syrupy
sweetness
taste
is
ok
a
bit
better
than
average
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
spiceness
to
it
carmel
induced
sweetness
with
very
minimal
hops
presence
for
a
mass
marketed
beer
its
not
too
bad
but
you
can
find
a
lot
better
examples
of
this
style
was
very
excited
to
see
the
local
watering
hole
had
run
out
of
sam
summer
and
now
had
oktoberfest
on
tapmy
first
marzen
of
the
year
the
beer
is
a
dark
brownish
amber
with
a
thin
cap
of
off
white
head
not
much
lacing
nose
is
slight
but
is
a
nice
nutty
and
slightly
doughy
aroma
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
caramel
roast
and
a
slight
nutty
finish
some
grassy
hops
are
barely
detectable
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
a
little
fizzy
with
a
mediumthin
body
this
is
another
decent
seasonal
from
sam
adams
that
has
the
advantage
of
widespread
availability
im
sure
this
wont
be
my
last
for
the
year
john
i
guess
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
just
never
wrote
a
review
of
strange
attractive
clear
dark
copper
appearance
nice
frothy
head
that
is
rippled
at
the
surface
simple
ring
laces
adequate
aroma
is
pleasant
deep
sense
of
nuts
and
sugar
bit
of
bready
graininess
carbonation
is
lower
mouthfeel
stands
at
just
shy
of
medium
very
easy
going
flavor
and
spot
on
as
far
as
typical
of
style
a
good
brown
sugar
approach
with
a
backbone
of
toastiness
that
integrates
well
with
the
body
slight
fade
as
the
beer
transitions
through
front
to
back
just
a
slight
uptick
in
a
sense
of
straw
and
hay
at
the
close
a
pretty
quaffable
example
of
an
ofest
here
with
a
deeper
color
typical
of
many
in
the
north
american
market
pours
a
copper
almostpumpkin
hue
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
very
intriguing
blend
of
chocolate
pumpkin
spices
and
a
light
grassy
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
with
a
strong
malt
presence
that
is
bready
and
slightly
sweet
and
a
light
grassy
hops
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
descent
but
nothing
to
shake
a
stick
at
i
would
drink
this
again
for
its
uniqueness
and
because
it
fits
the
season
so
well
also
it
is
a
good
standby
at
the
grocery
store
when
there
is
no
other
good
beer
the
aroma
is
pleasant
and
malty
as
hell
the
appearance
is
nice
orange
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
the
taste
is
nice
malty
with
some
nice
caramel
flavor
this
offering
compared
to
their
others
is
a
little
weak
though
and
for
the
category
of
ocktoberfest
it
is
a
little
weak
also
because
there
isnt
as
much
spice
as
i
would
like
but
the
drinkability
is
awesome
and
it
is
a
pleasant
brew
i
will
definately
take
brooklyn
breweys
offering
over
this
rich
amber
color
and
a
sticky
offwhite
head
malt
aroma
comes
off
fruity
almost
plum
like
a
faint
amount
of
hops
the
taste
is
about
the
same
very
fruity
malts
that
are
grape
like
a
faintness
of
hop
pulls
through
the
malts
kind
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
over
all
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
oktoberfest
beer
it
just
seems
like
it
was
better
a
few
years
ago
a
surprisingly
good
offering
from
sa
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
sample
it
again
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
came
down
pretty
quickly
as
with
most
oktoberfest
style
beers
this
has
a
great
drinkability
and
i
wish
i
had
a
bratwurst
right
now
to
go
with
it
i
found
it
to
be
slightly
hoppier
than
the
saranac
octoberfest
but
still
balanced
the
hoppiness
also
lasted
a
lot
longer
in
my
mouth
afterwards
i
like
this
beer
and
its
worth
a
try
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
saranac
octoberfest
drinkability
could
be
a
session
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
copper

brew
with
a
beige
34
head
lacing
is
good
plentiful
and
lasting
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
with
a
toasted
biscuit
backbone
taste
is
caramel
malts
with
the
frruity
flavor
pervasive
kind
of
hiding
other
notes
mouthfeel
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
with
the
fruitiness
for
me
but
once
you
settle
in
this
gets
pretty
drinkable
an
acceptable
seasonal
that
makes
a
good
backup
at
many
a
bars
micro
draft
wasteland
overallthis
is
another
fine
offering
by
sam
adams
perhaps
not
the
best
adaptation
of
the
style
im
dying
to
find
a
german
version
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
give
it
a
shot
drinkabilitynotes
an
pleasant
example
of
the
style
and
eminently
drinkable
prosit
medium

a
nice
readiy
available
oktoberfest
very
round
rich
mouthfeel
the
flavor
comes
late
but
strongly
hop
is
strictly
a
balancing
act
to
the
full
crystal
malt
flavors
the
hop
is
more
present
after
the
swallow
but
the
aftertaste
is
still
more
malt
its
also
long
lasting
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
minimal

unremarkable
grains
dominate
the
nose
with
a
faint
hint
of
spice
present
as
well
pumpkin
pie
spice
is
the
most
interesting
element
of
a
taste
that
is
otherwise
too
sweet
malts
eclipse
any
hops
that
are
present
but
even
those
flavors
fade
quickly
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
but
this
is
neither
a
good
sam
adams
nor
a
good
example
of
the
style
another
nice
ofest
though
not
an
excellent
one
the
tap
version
which
regrettably
i
was
not
able
to
make
notes
on
before
it
was
all
gone
struck
me
as
a
bit
better
than
this
but
its
still
not
bad
this
is
perfectly
acceptable
for
sitting
around
and
consuming
for
lack
of
anything
better
but
thats
about
it
while
not
a
bad
beer
theres
not
enough
character
in
this
to
inspire
me
to
purchase
it
again
dark
amber
with
quickly
fading
offwhite

initial
malty
taste
that
finishes
dry
bitter
and
a
little
mediciney
i
noted
caramel
in
the
aroma
and
taste
which
is
a
minus
for
this
style
as
a
dark
lager
maybe
but
as
an
oktoberfest
not
quite
i
like
the
new
label
taste
consists
of
muted
doughy
malt
flavors
up
front
a
hint
of
cookie
sweetness
comes
in
but
theres
not
much
hops
pick
it
up
toward
the
endspicy
and
sufficiently
bitter
finish
is
kinda
short
and
bitter
with
a
hint
of
malt
mediumbodied
kind
of
creamy
feel
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
its
definitely
better
on
tap
nothing
to
special
here
i
know
some
people
go
crazy
for
this
beer
its
decent
as
oktoberfests
go
one
thing
about
it
is
it
has
this
slight
fizzy
or
something
taste
to
it
i
dont
know
but
besides
that
its
pretty
ordinary
its
easy
to
drink
there
arnt
any
overbearing
tastes
just
a
general
oktoberfest
beer
taste
i
perfer
harpoons
sam
adams
octoberfest
is
a
lackluster
beer
to
some
extent
there
are
better
versions
out
there
and
im
convinced
that
bbc
is
capable
of
better
as
well
its
still
drinkable
and
has
no
serious
faults
but
it
isnt
a
seasonal
that
ill
return
to
pours
a
clear
burgundy
amber
under
a
two
finger
beige
head
that
fades
slowly
but
leaves
no
lace
a
strong
caramel
nose
greets
the
senses
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
fairly
light
the
opening
features
lots
of
caramel
maltiness
followed
by
a
mild
hoppy
presence
there
is
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
but
this
is
a
very
good
session
brew
yum
well
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
decently
colored
an
amberly
flow
with
tints
of
fall
leaves
turning
all
colors
of
red
brown
and
orange
in
a
glass
the
smell
is
up
front
and
malty
and
a
distinct
lager
smell
of
cold
storage
i
dont
know
but
i
seem
to
be
able
to
smell
a
lager
before
i
taste
it
the
taste
for
this
beer
was
a
blend
of
malts
and
tings
of
molasses
and
dark
malt
happiness
there
was
a
aftertaste
of
spiced
pumkin
and
fresh
fallen
leaves
that
at
first
was
unwelcome
and
then
excepted
and
pleasant
i
have
had
this
beer
for
several
years
now
and
while
i
thought
2003
was
better
this
year
is
not
bad
and
i
will
surely
have
another
before
they
are
gone
from
the
tap
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
no
head
at
all
probably
not
a
good
pour
from
the
bartended
a
few
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
no
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
disappears
smells
slightly
toasted
fruity
and
maybe
spicy
tastes
slight
carmel
again
with
some
fruit
notes
and
a
slight
hint
of
hop
bitterness
the
sweetness
never
seems
to
go
away
and
seems
to
be
a
bit
cloying
light
body
with
some
carbonation
seems
a
bit
watery
overall
fair
i
do
not
believe
this
beer
was
as
mediocre
last
year
or
the
year
before
as
it
seems
for
sam

first
let
me
state
that
this
is
clearly
better
than
last
years
attempt
at
an
octoberfest
beer
and
this
maybe
my
favorite
sam
adams
product
i
have
had
this
doesnt
say
a
whole
lot
not
too
found
of
ol
sammy
either
way
this
one
is
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
sized
creamy
tan
head
leaving
full
even
rings
of
lacing
beautiful
appearance
aroma
is
also
up
to
par
with
vienna
toasted
nut
malt
tones
in
the
aroma
and
residual
caramel
notes
arising
one
warming
treat
just
a
lil
early
in
mid
august
in
this
heat
just
not
fall
yet
flavors
blend
well
with
a
great
toasted
nuts
flavoring
from
the
specialty
malts
used
and
spiced
up
goodness
to
go
around
bringing
not
only
a
solid
representation
but
maybe
a
lil
uniqueness
from
the
bbc
finish
contains
som
mild
fruit
tones
and
a
bready
characteristic
that
i
call
the
sam
adams
funk
keep
in
mind
not
always
a
bad
funk
just
goes
here
mouhfeel
has
a
nice
texture
medium
bodied
rides
on
the
palate
oh
so
nicely
very
smooth
drinkability
dont
knock
it
till
ya
try
it
bc
i
almost
passed
on
it
and
with
all
the
discussion
on
the
forum
lately
youll
be
able
to
sound
your
opinion
theres
nothing
really
super
exciting
about
this
beer
but
overall
it
was
a
nice
drink
its
best
atributes
were
its
color
and
head
great
copperamberorange
color
with
a
large
head
and
a
very
clear
body
the
smell
was
pretty
average
wich
is
slightly
wheaty
with
very
little
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
good
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
body
and
maltiness
not
to
much
of
amything
very
easy
to
drink
notes
a
respectable
rendition
of
the
oktoberfest
style
slightly
superior
taste
profile
to
that
of
paulaners
märzen
which
i
drank
juxtapositionally
tastes
somewhat
like
the
boston
lager
to
me
only
a
little
sweeter
i
note
caramel
flavor
with
some
breadiness
added
along
could
be
more
complex
and
have
more
of
a
finish
to
it
still
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
and
one
that
i
would
drink
if
i
were
getting
drunk
at
my
local
oktoberfest
i
drink
a
lot
of
sam
adams
and
given
a
choice
i
would
drink
this
one
year
round
i
need
to
apologize
to
sam
because
i
bought
this
a
bit
past
the
month
of
expiration
but
i
dont
think
it
affects
this
review
the
pour
seemed
quite
robust
and
a
nice
head
came
up
without
coaxing
the
head
did
dissipate
a
little
too
quickly
and
not
much
lacing
was
present
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
background
of
hops
the
flavor
was
very
nice
and
gave
off
hints
of
malt
and
bread
but
these
were
well
balanced
by
the
light
hopping
crisp
finish
quite
dry
very
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
i
will
seek
it
out
next
year
when
its
released
again
color
is
a
clear
amberish
brown
with
a
white
head
that
fizzed
away
pretty
fast
and
left
some
lacy
patches
smell
is
faint
roasted
malt
a
bit
burnt
caramel
or
caramel
popcorn
taste
form
this
was
good
very
smooth
with
good
rich
sweet
malt
thats
mild
and
pleasing
some
drying
hop
presence
in
the
finish
but
is
not
strong
enough
thus
bringing
it
to
the
feel
a
little
empty
and
slightly
watery
lightermedium
body
smooth
clear
and
clean
with
some
dryness
and
sweetness
mixing
at
the
end
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
always
get
it
when
it
first
comes
out
but
its
no
snake
river
got
this
on
clearance
in
february
this
was
actually
a
decent
beer
it
tastes
malty
and
hoppy
and
was
a
little
lighter
than
regular
samuel
adams
there
are
floral
tones
to
this
almost
lemony
very
spritzy
in
the
carbonation
dept
full
bodied
and
tasty
all
the
way
around
from
what
i
understand
sa
changes
the
brew
from
year
to
year
i
will
try
it
again
this
winter
this
beer
to
the
credit
of
the
store
and
distributor
was
still
good
long
after
its
season
had
ended
dark
amber
with
a
white
head
i
like
octoberfest
beers
every
so
often
as
a
break
from
my
ales
while
a
decent
brew
overall
it
just
does
not
compete
with
others
from
the
style
too
many
punches
are
pulled
a
bit
of
a
fruityspicey
taste
mixed
in
with
the
malts
goes
down
really
smooth
this
is
not
your
typical
oktoberfest
the
first
and
last
thing
i
notice
here
is
the
hops
and
do
i
love
hops
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
the
12oz
bottles
just
arent
enough
i
have
to
get
the
big
glass
and
do
two
at
a
time
with
this
one
the
beer
finishes
clean
with
a
distinct
hop
after
flavor
that
is
the
ugh
factor
that
is
often
associated
with
to
many
microbrews
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
but
i
usually
wait
till
my
real
german
oktoberfest
run
out
this
cant
compete
in
the
european
market
i
am
sure
but
as
far
as
american
oktoberfest
beers
goes
i
would
have
to
rank
this
as
a
second
place
contender
ender
after
st
arnolds
oktoberfest
this
beer
caught
a
lot
of
heat
this
year
when
many
people
detected
corn
in
the
recipe
you
can
say
what
you
want
about
the
boston
beer
company
i
know
what
corn
tases
like
and
they
used
it
here
too
bad
nice
glowing
orangeamber
color
foamy
white
head
soft
roasted
malt
aroma
starts
sweet
some
flavors
of
toffee
and
caremel
medium
body
seems
to
change
a
bit
from
year
to
year
still
not
bad
and
avalible
at
most
grocery
stores
poured
light
amber
in
color
with
an
inch
head
that
contained
bubbles
of
varying
size
malty
in
smell
and
taste
much
more
flavor
than
i
remembered
but
still
not
a
ton
lacking
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
say
this
is
inline
with
harpoons
offering
but
far
from
the
german
offerings
i
have
heard
this
is
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
but
havent
sampled
the
tap
version
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
creamcolored
foamy
head
aroma
consisted
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
had
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
medium
body
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
in
the
middle
than
just
malt
and
the
punch
of
alcohol
slightly
grainy
finish
a
nice
hearty
fall
beer
and
a
respectable
offering
from
sam
adams
but
not
their
best
samuel
adams
october
fest
has
all
the
good
looks
of
an
oktoberfest
but
just
some
of
the
good
tastes
of
one
for
a
soso
beer
of
the
style
because
of
the
hops
competing
with
the
sweet
malt
for
the
tongues
attention
not
a
fan
of
sam
adams
but
i
recommend
this
one
i
tried
a
bottle
of
this
shortly
after
getting
it
on
draught
as
expected
the
experience
was
not
quite
as
good
another
good
seasonal
from
sammys
although
not
as
good
as
old
fezziwig
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
dissipated
quickly
malty
lightly
floral
aroma
nice
malty
flavor
with
light
citrus
notes
slightly
lacking
on
the
marzen
scale
but
i
couldnt
find
much
to
complain
about
an
interesting
mix
of
smells
initially
mild
mix
of
malt
and
hops
which
moves
to
a
sharper
toast
malt
then
fades
to
an
almost
undetectable
aroma
big
full
head
with
lacing
orangeamber
color
nice
blending
of
malt
flavors
having
smoothness
and
complexity
well
balanced
with
light
hop
dryness
ample
richness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
for
style
but
i
prefer
that
mildly
rich
quite
good
all
around
beer
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
a
brownish
orange
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
nose
is
so
slight
almost
indetectable
perhaps
a
slight
bit
of
candycoated
apple
taste
is
mainly
candy
corn
malt
sweetness
theres
really
no
toasted
malt
flavor
like
one
finds
in
a
good
german
marzen
hops
are
appropriately
in
the
background
not
a
bad
beer
but
sams
ofest
has
been
much
richer
in
the
past
now
its
more
of
a
quencher
good
with
chili
amber
equal
balance
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
aroma
very
smooth
going
down
the
hatch
but
as
an
oktober
i
thought
it
should
have
some
more
malt
flavor
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
it
tastes
good
but
it
seems
this
is
more
of
a
drink
but
dont
think
oktoberfest
ie
a
fancy
seasonal
for
the
bmc
crowd
promises
but
just
does
not
deliver
for
me
it
will
not
be
purchased
again
hazy
copperish
in
color
appropriate
head
and
lace
i
get
more
hops
in
the
nose
than
malt
and
strangely
the
taste
is
almost
the
same
it
just
seems
something
is
missing
from
this
fest
too
much
tingle
on
the
tongue
rather
than
waves
of
malty
goodness
its
sweet
but
without
the
welcome
toasted
malt
flavors
that
should
accompany
it
brewed
for
the
masses
rather
than
for
the
ofest
lovers
still
its
an
ok
brew
and
its
easy
to
drink
many
in
a
sitting
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
tight
head
has
nice
nutty
and
fruity
aromas
has
a
strange
mouthfeel
for
an
octoberfest
but
the
flavor
reveals
light
hops
with
light
caramel
on
the
nose
and
crisp
fruitiness
with
medicinal
aftertaste
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
semisticky
on
the
tail
more
crisp
than
others
of
this
style
not
too
bad
but
way
below
great
cheers
not
a
twist
off
chalk
one
up
for
sam
adams
its
already
ahead
in
my
book
pours
nicely
with
a
dark
amber
hue
thick
head
disspates
quickly
malty
with
a
slight
bite
its
not
very
complex
with
a
smoky
flavor
complements
smoked
brisket
the
real
bbq
pretty
well
a
tasty
seasonal
beer
worth
trying
each
autumn
the
bar
by
my
school
we
always
go
to
chippers
pub
has
a
1
75
sam
adams
wednesday
night
special
and
i
tried
a
couple
of
these
when
they
came
in
and
took
a
few
home
i
was
impressed
the
dark
orange
amber
color
is
alluring
but
alas
the
little
head
that
pours
disapates
quickly
but
does
leave
a
nice
thick
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
has
a
very
malty
and
fruity
taste
leaves
me
with
an
aftertaste
of
slight
carmelness
some
say
this
beer
is
a
little
sweet
and
it
may
be
too
sweet
to
get
drunk
off
of
but
out
of
respect
and
my
wallet
i
rarely
get
loaded
off
sams
hell
thats
what
yuengling
is
for
for
the
next
few
months
i
will
definetly
be
drinking
more
of
these
decent
worth
getting
a
sixer
of
to
try
but
unlike
past
years
not
worth
going
back
to
stock
up
on
a
case
i
am
baffled
reading
the
reviews
of
this
one
and
wondering
if
i
got
an
off
6
pack
the
beer
is
great
to
look
at
translucent
amber
ruby
with
a
thin
lacy
head
but
in
all
other
respects
was
very
unimpressive
somewhat
malty
in
flavor
and
aroma
with
very
noticeable
medicinal
almost
like
maraschino
cherries
overtones
that
almost
make
the
beer
undrinkable
some
hops
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
which
is
kind
of
out
of
character
for
the
style
pretty
thin
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
this
is
one
that
i
have
really
enjoyed
in
the
past
but
if
its
supposed
to
taste
the
way
this
6er
does
i
wont
be
drinking
it
anymore
i
thought
this
to
be
a
good
festive
seasonal
brew
im
not
aware
of
years
past
and
changes
i
enjoyed
this
years
as
its
appearance
was
outstanding
good
dark
copperorange
color
offwhite
head
with
thick
ringlike
lace
classic
look
taste
was
smooth
malty
carmal
the
abv
is
kicked
up
alittle
but
not
in
the
taste
or
smell
it
had
a
very
autumn
character
just
as
i
expected
this
years
version
2002
seems
bit
light
cleaner
on
tap
and
less
tasty
than
the
bottled
version
but
still
drinkable
and
enjoyable
caramel
taste
that
isnt
overdone
decent
its
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
nothing
fantastic
but
still
quality
very
smooth
with
some
sweet
maltiness
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
little
hops
hit
you
at
the
end
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
top
of
the
line
oktoberfest
but
it
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
i
found
it
very
good
to
drink
but
not
with
a
spicy
pizza
as
the
two
did
not
like
each
other
mediocre
offering
from
our
friends
at
boston
beer
co
sweet
malty
core
with
a
periphery
of
dried
fruit
and
leaf
and
a
metallic
note
or
two
slim
body
the
greatest
point
about
sam
adams
october
fest
is
that
it
succeeds
in
bringing
the
sensations
of
autumn
to
the
palate
somewhere
at
the
boston
beer
company
hq
there
is
a
box
marked
oktoberfest
flavor
because
it
is
not
in
the
bottle
and
i
checked
6
times
it
pours
a
nice
color
and
the
head
looks
great
but
doesnt
last
long
not
much
lace
either
the
taste
is
bland
and
it
just
doesnt
have
that
octoberfest
uniqueness
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
i
dont
like
to
bash
but
this
one
is
below
average
this
is
a
very
safe
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
very
average
and
unexciting
compared
to
other
oktoberfestbiers
worth
trying
if
its
all
you
can
get
but
worth
passing
on
if
you
can
find
better
i
also
swear
that
the
recipe
is
being
dumbed
down
every
year
well
lagered
crystal
clear
dark
copper
in
hue
covered
by
an
ivory
white
thick
persistant
head
that
leaves
rough
lace
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
a
spicy
herbal
noble
hop
nose
accompanied
by
lightly
toasty
munich
and
caramel
malt
fruity
melanoidins
are
present
as
a
trace
fairly
tame
aromawise
bready
biscuity
sweetness
upfront
yields
to
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruitiness
with
mild
hop
bitterness
providing
a
lightly
bittersweet
character
mid
palate
lightly
bodied
and
crisp
in
mouthfeel
lending
an
oddly
refreshing
nature
to
this
brew
finishes
w
trace
notes
of
butter
this
is
not
a
particularly
good
octoberfest
due
to
its
thin
malt
backbone
and
overall
lack
of
complexity
sams
ofest
is
flavorful
and
clean
enough
for
good
drinkability
however
its
better
than
average
for
sure
not
really
bad
but
the
standard
boston
lager
is
more
complex
and
inviting
i
agree
with
what
beerluvr
said
about
this
beer
being
different
in
the
past
it
seems
to
be
more
malty
and
syrupy
than
that
of
previous
years
the
carbonation
appeared
to
be
off
as
wellnot
as
sticky
i
did
drink
this
as
soon
as
it
was
released
as
opposed
to
drinking
last
years
after
it
had
aged
a
bit
some
guys
at
my
work
had
questioned
the
difference
too
so
i
knew
i
wasnt
crazy
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
not
a
favorite
and
i
will
hesitate
next
year
this
seasonal
offering
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
huge
pillowy
head
that
leaves
considerable
lace
the
head
is
rather
overwhelming
and
holds
up
well
the
smell
on
the
other
hand
is
lacking
i
smell
a
somewhat
nutty
malty
aroma
but
its
subdued
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
and
malty
with
some
fruity
undertones
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
lightly
carbonated
but
it
does
bring
the
drinkability
up
a
bit
this
is
one
of
the
better
domestic
octoberfest
offerings
and
is
worth
seeking
out
pours

as
i
was
expecting
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
with
this
i
remember
it
being
a

bigger
in
years
past

foamy

decent

fruit
spice
hops

alcohol
all
in

drinkable
very
good
what
you
would
expect
from
sam
adams
pours
a
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
slightly
foamy
and
sticky
offwhite
head
on
the
nose
the
aroma
of
the
noble
hops
comes
through
hints
of
fruit
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
slightly
grainy
a
bit
sharp
at
first
but
settles
down
on
the

of
mild
fruit
caramel
toasted
malts
slight
hop
bitterness
tastes
a
bit
like
a
very
very
light
sa
dobble
bocknot
really
a
good
ofest
though
to
many
better
ones
out
there
still
drinkable
though
my
least
favorite
ofest
to
date
actually
one
of
the
least
favorite
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
reddish
to
light
copper
coloring
minimal
white
head
a
balance
of
citruslike
hops
and
malty
aromas
in
the
nose
this
balance
remains
evident
in
the
taste
as
neither
hops
nor
malts
takes
the
lead
i
have
to
say
that
its
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
the
smell
and
appearance
might
lead
you
to
believe
but
nonetheless
its
easy
to
drink
and
it
did
keep
my
interest
at
least
for
one
pint
2002
release
orangeamber
color
and
a
white
head
with
many
large
bubbles
head
stays
well
for
a
bit
but
eventually
goes
down
to
a
thin
lace
apparently
this
one
needs
a
good
hard
pour
to
retain
a
head
malty
smell
with
some
hop
character
and
fruitiness
lots
of
toasted
malt
flavor
that
is
typical
of
sam
adams
beers
sweet
hop
flavor
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
which
seems
to
increase
as
you
drink
more
lots
of
flavor
here
but
not
quite
as
much
as
i
would
expect
from
a
sam
adams
beer
still
a
good
brew
in
my
opinion
and
definitely
worth
trying
to
my
mind
this
seems
mellower
than
recent
years
i
find
this
a
boon
because
i
seem
to
remember
my
palate
growing
tired
after
one
or
two
bottles
from
the
previous
batches
perhaps
something
has
been
sacrificed
but
overall
i
think
its
a
plus
at
least
in
the
drinkability
department
cushy
head
atop
a
crystal
clear
amber
liquid
slight
musty
aroma
tangy
malts
with
just
the
right
trace
of
spices
to
let
you
know
youve
got
a
fest
beer
grasped
tightly
in
your
mitt
the
taste
profile
goes
through
its
cycle
quickly
ending
up
with
a
photo
finish
containing
faint
echoes
of
the
flavor
nice
and
gummy
even
though
sam
has
been
troubled
recently
in
the
pr
department
im
enjoying
their
specialty
beers
read
anything
other
than
boston
lager
and
light
more
than
ever
think
ill
have
a
cream
stout
a
little
later
on
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
and
an
ok
way
to
celebrate
the
season
imo
rich
copperorange
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
subtle
noble
hop
aromas
slightly
spicy
with
a
little
caramel
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
dominated
by
malt
but
the
hop
presence
is
there
to
keep
things
balanced
a
bit
juicy
slight
alcohol
spiciness
in
the
finish
ill
have
another
thank
you
moderate
carbonation
and
frothy
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
but
leaves
some
lace
copperorange
color
and
more
malt
than
hops
in
fact
the
hops
are
barely
noticable
nose
has
some
fruitiness
but
it
is
barely
noticeable
finish
is
smooth
with
some
sweetness
but
not
cloying
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
year
after
year
medium
head
that
quickly
fades
burnt
golden
color
aroma
could
be
more
pronounced
malty
sweet
and
satisfying
good
balance
with
a
soft
creamy
finish
subtle
bittering
hops
emerge
at
the
end
of
a
lingering
aftertaste
good
beer
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
deep
clear
copper
hue
a
decent
white
head
that
is
well
retained
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
body
of
about
medium
taste
is
pretty
average
subtle
toasted
tones
some
maltiness
minimal
bitterness
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
but
by
no
means
will
i
be
dumping
this

as
deep
orange
a
beer
as
youll
ever
see
with
an
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
stickiness
this
beer
has
an
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
fresh
bread
very
pronounced
malt
flavor
with
great
spiciness
the
beer
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
and
it
carries
through
to
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
always
meant
fall
to
me
and
this
was
very
fresh
but
ive
found
through
long
experience
that
this
beer
ages
very
well
buy
it
now
because
itll
be
gone
in
october
but
itll
last
till
june
prosit
finish
was
sweet
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
finish
maybe
even
a
touch
of
fruit
cheers
to
frank4sail
for
the
sample
12
oz
bottle
malty
slight
hint
of
cardboard
oxidation
below
average
for
the
style
decent
mouthfeel
but
nothing
there
of
any
positive
taste
not
one
of
sams
best
im
now
sorry
i
got
a
case
of
this
stuff
it
looks
alot
better
than
it
tasted
was
pleasantly
suprised
byt
how
authentic
it
was
nice
malty
flavor
and
good
color
i
like
most
sam
adams
products
a
solid
american
take
on
the
style
moderately
sweet
with
a
little
less
malt
backbone
than
average
for
the
style
but
smooth
and
good
natured
very
malty
with
a
fair
smack
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
a
bit
too
fruity
for
the
style
still
a
very
good
beer
and
a
heck
of
a
deal
at
under
10
for
a
12pack
i
have
noticed
that
this
years
octoberfest
is
alot
sweeter
and
has
more
of
a
caramel
flavour
it
tastes
alot
more
like
a
ale
than
a
lager
it
actually
tastes
alot
like
their
stock
ale
now
this
is
a
nice
beer
rather
chewy
and
malty
this
is
the
first
ive
had
this
in
a
long
time
really
very
nice
2001
very
malty
as
it
should
be
the
malt
flavors
are
up
front
sweetish
ripe
and
fruity
with
an
alcoholic
flavor
as
well
that
leads
into
the
firm
hop
bitterness
hops
are
present
only
towards
the
end
lacking
any
flowery
flavors
in
the
nose
but
definately
accomplish
what
theyre
in
there
for
cutting
through
the
slightly
syrupy
body
for
a
decent
finish
nice
for
those
early
fall
cool
spells
nice
amber
color
makes
this
beer
appear
warm
and
inviting
sweet
and
malty
well
balanced
also
very
crisp
in
some
ways
i
drank
it
with
a
bison
burger
and
its
flavor
lasted
until
the
end
drank
warm
and
it
was
still
great
nice
look
sweet
smelling
smooth
drinking
good
sweet
bread
flavor
not
overly
complex
gets
that
stale
apple
juice
flavor
if
you
dont
drink
it
fast
enough
maltiness
with
just
enough
hops
to
let
you
know
youve
got
an
honest
to
god
german
beer
here
decent
beer
at
a
good
price
bonus
points
for
weighting
in
at
a
none
too
shabby

overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
tastier
oktoberfests
ive
had
i
bought
the
last
case
of
this
stuff
at
my
local
distributor
and
i
have
no
regrets
i
can
drink
several
of
these
puppies
in
a
row
to
a
nice
comfortable
effect
not
overpowering
but
not
weak
either
it
strikes
a
pretty
good
balance
overall
pours
a
clear

with
white
head
nose
is
heavy
with
grainy
malts
lager
yeast
some
sweet
grape
like
character
and
a
touch
of
green
apple
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
some
candied
grape
flavor
followed
by
grain
and
bread
finish
is
sweet
with
mild
dryness
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
oktoberfest
leans
towards
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
not
bad
light
and
clean
good

you
can

the
beer
is

is
nondescript
fairly
sweet
with

being
the
major
flavor
here
and
nothing
to
indicate

nothing
toasty
one

there
is
a

herbal
on
the

its

not
the

it
o

this
is
a

for
americans
the
buzz
is
excellant
f
the
sastmo
the
regular
guy
that
is
used
to
the
3
big
american
breweries
will
like
this
beer
stop
with
the
bourgeuois
b
s
f
the
craft
and
micro
brews
they
are
overkill
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
isnt
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
overall
its
interesting
to
see
a
northern
german
brewery
brew
an
oktoberfest
beer
as
that
style
of
beer
is
traditionally
only
brewed
by
bavarian
breweries
maybe
because
of
the
popularity
of
the
style
here
in
the
u
s
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
those
from
the
bavarian
breweries
o
a
good
solid
fest
beer
dig
it
prost
overall
a
great
brew
im
shocked
at
the
less
then
stellar
rating
it
receives
here
clear
gold
yellow
pour
with
white
head
that
stays
around
but
doesnt
lace
smells
like
a
euro
pilsner
with
bread
crust
or
cracker
sweetness
taste
is
pale
bread
crust
with
a
toffee
finish
in
the
end
strange
bitterness
in
the
end
alcohol
is
present
as
it
warms
not
enough
taste
to
cover
its
almost
6
abv
mouthfeel
is
smooth
for
a
lager
but
enough
bite
to
keep
it
crisp
this
beer
is
good
for
the
warmer
months
of
september
but
later
fall
id
want
a
darker
richer
oktoberfest
for
sure
well
worth
trying
aroma
is
crackers
and
typical
german
lager
crispness
reminds
of
a
pils
with
a
hint
more
malt
the
taste
has
that
familiar
oktoberfest
munich
malt
sweetness
but
with
a
lighter
more
bubbly
mouthfeel
based
on
the
color
mouthfeel
and
taste
i
would
classify
this
as
a
oktoberfestlite
still
quite
good
but
not
as
complex
and
rich
as
a
traditional
of
i
love
of
but
they
can
get
a
bit
heavy
after
a
few
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
people
who
prefer
lighter
beers
or
if
you
are
really
planning
to
trow
down
i
like
it
not
as
an
of
but
if
i
wanted
something
a
bit
heavier
than
a
pils
o
mediocre
beer
meh
my
oktoberfest
season
hasnt
ended
just
yet
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
toffee
grass
a
touch
of
butter
and
a
few
sprinklings
of
mild
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
ups
the
grass
and
greens
and
adds
a
touch
of
orange
peel
still
the
dry
buttery
biscuit
steals
the
show
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
ofest
but
id
put
it
in
the
lower
echelon
of
those
from
the
fatherland
a
proper
octoberfest
i
think
darker
like
an
amber
in
appearance
with
a
small
and
fading
off
white
head
however
the
smell
is
malty
but
not
sweet
which
is
perfect
in
this
style
the
flavor
imports
a
much
more
dark
malt
profile
into
one
of
these
oktobers
roasty
and
rich
less
sugary
and
filling
than
some
can
be
i
would
drink
several
liters
of
this
no
worries
there
is
also
a
sort
of
essence
of
fall
to
this
which
is
not
necessarily
explained
easily
but
it
works
for
me
the
feel
is
good
heavier
in
body
than
most
but
well
carbonated
and
plenty
drinkable
im
really
into
it
great
with
a
smoked
ham
hock
and
one
of
those
seasonals
ill
go
back
to
again
and
again
lovely
and
underrated
overall
a
very
maltforward
brew
as
expected
lacks
complexity
and
the
cola
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
lackluster
oktoberfest
märzen
though
its
far
from
offensive
in
character
maybe
a
first
step
into
richer
beers
for
a
beginner
but
not
the
best
example
of
style
i
am
surprised
at
the
low
score
this
one
has
maybe
due
to
americans
ignorant
expectations
that
an
oktoberfest
has
to
be
dark
and
toasty
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
sweet
grainy
presence
that
drives
the
beer
but
finishes
clean
with
a
somewhat
crispy
hop
note
it
is
kind
of
like
a
kickedup
helles
lager
and
is
done
quite
nicely
i
really
like
it
and
is
quite
a
bargain
at
12
99
a
12pack
i
may
have
found
my
goto
oktoberfest
for
2012
here
nice
stuff
kind
of
light
for
a
marzen
in
general
deep
straw
color
with
literally
no
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
the
smell
was
initially
a
bit
skunky
but
it
faded
lots
of
sweet
grain
with
a
very
light
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
not
enough
of
anything
the
taste
is
just
too
bitter
and
light
medicinalearthy
hop
flavors
stand
out
too
much
for
style
hint
of
sweet
grains
and
caramel
finishes
super
clean
and
sweet
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
with
other
versions
of
the
style
be
it
german
or
american
this
beer
sticks
with
tradition
and
thats
good
its
not
however
in
the
same
league
as
some
that
have
taken
the
style
and
built
upon
it
not
too
shabby
im
enjoying
my
first
warsteiner
oktoberfest
no
its
not
the
heavy
sweet
ofest
beer
american
craftbrewers
brew
every
yearof
which
you
can
drink
a
couple
at
most
at
a
sitting
this
is
a
classic
german
session
beer
meant
to
pound
down
glass
after
glass
in
stammtisch
talking
with
friends
as
long
as
you
can
stand
being
around
each
other
light
mouthfeel
that
is
enjoyable
overall
a
lesser
alternative
to
a
spaten
warsteiners
marzen
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
grains
sweet
malts
pretty
standard
for
the
style
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
toasted
grains
caramel
malts
cardboard
light
hops
give
a
mildly
bitter
finish
lightmedium
body
a
bit
thin
and
bland
overall
but
easily
drinkable
at
least
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
yellow
highlights
under
the
light
with
a
1
finger
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
flavor
is
mainly
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
notes
of
bread
crust
and
brown
sugar
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
warsteiner
premium
oktoberfest
is
a
good
beer
recommended
not
impressed
wouldnt
recommend
especially
at
close
to
10
a
6
pack
i
dont
know
what
youre
paying
for
i
think
the
thing
i
remember
most
about
this
beer
was
the
glass
o
this
beer
is
a
good
option
for
celebrating
oktoberfest
because
it
has
a
very
drinkable
character
and
light
presence
although
it
could
be
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
for
some
people
oddont
love
marzens
this
one
is
more
intense
than
others
i
have
tried
sharper
and
less
smooth
than
others
i
enjoy
the
brashness
do
i
like
this
more
than
hackerpschorrs
marzen
is
the
question
both
came
cheap
for
a
twelve
pack
not
bad
overall
a
brew
that
somewhat
is
in
alignment
with
the
style
although
it
was
a
little
light
in
flavor
for
a
typical
märzen
it
has
that
special
warsteiner
grain
that
floats
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
well
given
it
is
oct
1
this
brew
fits
the
bill
well
tis
a
good
example
of
the
clasic
style
i
am
sure
but
give
me
the
highland
brewing
octoberfest
any
day
not
crisp
enough
to
engender
any
desire
for
more
and
too
much
german
lager
diesel
character
to
boot
medium
body
higher
carbonation
thinner
and
clean
on
the
tongue
honestly
this
was
a
pretty
boring
take
on
the
marzen
and
i
struggled
to
pull
the
flavors
and
scents
out
overall
great
nice
malts
straw
toast
dry
clean
and
crisp
noble
hops
just
delicious
o
a
lighter

golden
yellow
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
bubbly
foamy
white
head
that
reduced
to
a
sturdy
white
cap
light
grainy
aroma
a
bit
musty
with
an
herbal
hoppiness
wet
and
tangy
feel
breadlike
grain
flavors
throughout
with
a
hoppy
tang
in
the
middle
that
introduces
an
herbal
hoppiness
to
the
finish
finishes
clean
and
mellow
this
was
pretty
good
but
after
tasting
quite
a
few
marzens
this
season
theres
a
lot
more
to
offer
out
there
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
there
isnt
any
remarkable
notes
but
it
worked
well
with
the
pizza
dark
gold
clean
white
film
of
bubbles
somewhat
hoppier
than
expected
with
an
earthy
spice
flavor
mingled
with
damp
grain
rather
musky
as
it
goes
along
not
at
all
maerzen
like
more
like
a
dortmunder
export
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
of
the
many
oktoberfests
that
hit
the
shelves
this
time
of
year
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
i
do
encourage
trying
it
on
tap
o
an
ok
beer
not
really
in
my
taste
range
but
maybe
drink
it
again
on
tap
to
see
the
difference
edit
i
will
buy
this
one
again
in
the
fall
just
to
see
if
its
freshness
had
anything
to
do
with
my
negative
tasting
i
dont
have
high
hopes
though
1l
bottle
at
my
local
biergarten
i
am
going
against
the
grain
on
this
one
and
rate
it
one
of
my
top
10
oktoberfest
biers
poured
clear
bright
golden
with
faint
shimmers
of
copper
just
a
dusting
of
head
stuck
around
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
notes
of
corn
syrup
and
caramel
at
first
hoppage
was
on
the
light
side
with
some
fruity
and
leafy
presence
the
flavor
opened
with
lemon
zest
and
almost
oaky
sourness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
syrupy
sweetness
rolled
in
and
ended
up
supporting
a
bit
more
of
the
lemon
and
some
spicy
bitterness
finished
sweet
with
caramel
and
corn
lightmedium
bodied
and
tangy
on
the
palate
which
interfered
with
clearly
evident
underlying
smoothness
overall
its
actually
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
so
i
am
doing
this
largely
from
memory
very
different
from
other
beers
in
this
style
maybe
this
is
a
more
accurate
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
was
disappointed
this
is
not
what
i
expected
for
the
style
it
isnt
bad
just
average
time
to
get
into
the
fall
spirit
with
some
nice
fest
beers
this
one
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
with
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
sharp
and
crisp
with
hints
of
lemon
and
a
slight
yeastiness
the
taste
starts
out
thin
and
bland
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
an
unpleasant
bitterness
some
hints
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
before
a
fast
fairly
clean
finish
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
d
its
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
but
it
certainly
does
not
fit
the
profile
of
beer
that
i
thought
i
was
drinking
notes
really
doesnt
deviate
much
from
the
verum
it
tastes
alright
but
not
a
great
oktoberfest
a
good
session
brew
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
pours
an
ultraclear
golden
color
a
finebubbled
white
head
patches
to
the
glass
smell
is
there
some
toasted
malts
and
some
grassy
quality
taste
has
a
bit
more
mineral
quality
to
it
but
has
a
very
nice
toasted
malt
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
but
i
feel
like
it
is
definitely
above
average
dvery
drinkable
the
thing
with
oktoberfest
beers
is
that
youre
going
to
be
drinking
large
amounts
of
it
if
in
the
right
setting
i
definitely
want
to
drink
large
amounts
of
this
i
could
have
as
many
german
yards
of
this
as
it
would
take
for
me
to
pass
out
not
a
distinguished
marzen
but
a
nice
taste
well
balanced
and
really
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
encourages
you
to
go
for
more
d
a
good
oktoberfest
with
an
extremely
good
drinkability
lighter
for
the
style
but
good
this
is
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
by
any
means
i
think
they
got
the
pilsner
tanks
mixed
up
with
the
marzen
tanks
its
like
a
macro
pilsner
with
artificial
sweetener
had
on
tap
old
chicago
it
came
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
frash
tan
ringsmell
was
grain
malt
and
peat
moss
smells
taste
was
malty
caramelsome
toffee
with
earthy
tastes
noble
hops
were
in
the
background
but
not
prominent
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
lots
of
earthy
malts
and
grain
tastes
an
easy
one
to
drink
but
not
real
tasty
its
one
to
try
this
time
of
year
however
d
sure
why
not
but
there
are
better
fests
out
there
worth
a
try
but
what
beer
isnt
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
gold
with
a
tinge
of
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
lighttan
head
that
fizzles
out
quickly
grainy
sweet
aroma
bready
german
malts
flavor
is
malty
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
i
like
a
more
bready
earthy
lager
its
less
tiresome
on
the
palate
a
little
sticky
through
the
finish
achieves
what
its
going
for
but
its
not
something
to
revisit
while
too
high
for
a
session
beer
one
could
easily
go
round
after
round
while
relaxing
with
friends
or
watching
a
game
not
pretentions
or
hugely
over
the
top
this
one
is
just
well
done
drinkability
good
i
would
buy
this
again
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
with
a
fair
crisp
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
a
biscuity
sweet
malt
taste
of
biscuity
grain
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
and
a
light
hoppy
dry
finish
mouthfeel
has
a
smooth
light
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
a
good
easy
drink
not
bad
but
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
drinkability
very
especially
for
the
season
pours
a
golden
sunshine
and
copper
color
with
ok
bubbling
and
a
very
quick
head
the
aroma
is
pilsner
malts
with
a
little
extra
toast
to
them
this
smells
just
like
the
flagship
warsteiner
pilsner
but
with
just
a
little
toastiness
this
beer
tastes
just
like
the
flagship
warsteiner
pilsner
just
a
little
toastier
i
wouldnt
be
surprisewd
if
it
was
teh
exact
same
recipe
with
maybe
some
caramel
malts
thrown
into
the
mix
very
drinkable
beer
just
doesnt
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
character
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
lace
the
aroma
presents
a
very
light
amount
of
malt
character
and
of
course
a
touch
of
the
yeast
esters
the
taste
brings
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
not
a
lot
else
a
surpriseing
amount
of
body
for
the
lack
of
malt
in
the
taste
good
carbonation
and
an
easy
drink
drinkability
having
said
that
its
a
nice
light
beer
not
quite
crisp
but
good
enough
the
lightness
of
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
feels
very
good
when
going
down
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
seasib
but
is
light
so
could
be
good
for
a
warmer
day
then
mid
to
late
october
d
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
exactly
sure
what
makes
this
one
an
oktoberfest
as
compared
to
their
regular
offering
as
this
is
one
of
the
lightest
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
virtually
no
malts
for
a
style
which
typically
is
quite
malty
notes
this
was
a
very
basic
but
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
beer
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
would
have
loved
more
head
retention
i
had
this
on
tap
at
capones
it
is
a
light
amber
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
the
flavor
profile
is
sweet
with
toasted
malts
and
the
finish
lingers
a
bit
the
beer
went
down
smooth
for
a
full
bodied
brew
a
solid
brew
dont
expect
an
award
winner
here
but
it
was
a
solid
drinkable
beer
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
a
pale
orangedeep
yellow
color
nice
german
brewed
coloring
with
some
very
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
clean
and
malty
scent
with
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
great
flavor
a
nice
and
deep
maltiness
thick
with
a
nice
caramel
tone
to
it
went
down
great
very
nice
oktoberfest
overall
non
offensive
and
an
easy
drinker
medium
to
light
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
prolly
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
night
not
my
favorite
style
but
thats
just
my
opinion
d
quite
nice
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
richly
integrated
character
of
the
ideal
marzen
but
its
worth
a
try
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
drinkability
is
higher
than
expected
a
unique
twist
on
and
oktoberfest
good
to
try
during
the
season
if
you
grow
tired
of
the
normal
marzen
style
note
this
is
not
a
typical
example
of
the
style
though
but
i
did
enjoy
it
more
than
any
other
warsteiner
to
date
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
strong
crisp
malty
and
slightly
fruity
mainly
banana
flavor
is
malty
and
crisp
with
a
firm
undertone
of
banana
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
texture
is
smooth
and
only
slightly
fizzy
rather
pleasing
pours
a
soapy
white
head
and
is
quite
fizzy
smell
is
decent
of
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
a
husky
grain
and
almonds
possibly
very
smooth
taste
a
bit
of
a
harsh
twang
at
the
end
i
can
taste
the
husky
grain
not
much
on
the
caramel
flavours
very
easy
to
drink
highly
carbonated
really
refreshing
but
not
a
top
notch
beer
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
a
good
representation
of
style
there
arent
a
lot
of
qualities
that
make
this
beer
anything
like
a
typical
ofest
and
overall
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
again
overall
it
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
with
nothing
offputting
about
it
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
easily
a
good
choice
for
an
oktoberfest
session
not
the
first
oktoberfest
i
will
grab
but
maybe
closer
to
october
3rd
this
is
what
i
would
go
for
to
break
up
the
monotony
tastes
like
a
grassy
bready
and
citrusy
lager
not
bad
my
first
octoberfest
hopefully
they
get
much
better
than
this
drinks
easy
could
surely
spend
hours
on
end
downing
these
in
a
biergarten
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
malt
scent
with
a
faint
munich
malt
sweetness
and
next
to
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
below
average
it
has
a
very
bland
pilsner
flavor
with
an
ultra
dry
finish
its
got
zero
marzen
character
and
little
to
be
festive
about
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
co2
this
is
a
beer
for
the
scrap
heap
its
a
poor
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
there
are
no
strong
flavors
here
but
what
is
here
is
done
well
i
found
it
very
much
like
the
original
warsteiner
if
you
remember
college
and
losing
at
beiruit
how
the
beer
you
had
to
drink
as
a
penalty
always
tasted
worse
and
was
hard
to
get
down
thats
what
this
beer
reminded
me
of
d
not
the
best
oktoberfest
around
but
pretty
decent
a
fairly
solid
pickup
in
my
book
although
this
was
lighter
bodied
it
had
some
character
to
it
refreshing
and
to
me
a
little
different
from
other
marzens
worked
for
me
second
rewiew
on
ba
so
bear
with
me
i
got
a
12
of
this
at
centralmarket
today
really
like
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
poured
into
tall
glass
nice
head
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
below
very
lively
carbonation
head
held
for
a
little
while
then
drops
to
small
white
ring
round
the
edges
smell
is
very
pleasant
and
nice
smells
like
a
nice
fall
day
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
was
in
germany
in
high
school
and
this
took
me
there
also
made
me
think
of
a
beer
garden
in
the
early
cool
fall
and
made
me
want
to
sit
outside
the
rest
of
the
day
color
is
light
light
amber
or
darker
yellow
depending
on
light
first
sip
is
great
very
balanced
malt
and
biscuityeasty
flavor
taste
like
an
early
fall
day
somehow
very
lively
mouthfeel
followed
by
something
spicy
or
clove
lingers
as
well
and
is
very
pleasant
another
review
said
this
beer
was
elegant
and
i
would
have
to
agree
this
is
exactly
what
i
hoped
for
from
a
german
octoberfest
beer
thinking
of
it
now
this
is
exactly
what
i
wish
more
american
beers
would
go
for
simple
and
good
very
clean
but
lively
at
the
same
time
this
is
what
budmillercoors
should
taste
like
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sitting
in
the
back
yard
enjoying
the
day
and
waiting
of
october
to
get
here
will
get
again
soon

d
lucky
for
me
to
get
a
12
of
this
midsummer
and
its
still
good
n
fresh
funny
how
a
style
i
used
to
hate
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
fast
toffee
and
light
butterscotch
with
a
bready
yeastiness
a
pretty
light
looking
and
smelling
example
of
the
style
light
caramel
maltiness
noble
hops
and
fresh
bread
come
to
mind
finishes
dry
light
bodied
and
refreshing
this
is
the
beer
that
is
served
every
year
at
a
big
local
oktoberfest
celebration
in
indy
every
year
and
even
though
its
not
a
really
great
fest
brew
it
brings
back
personal
memories
for
me
i
look
forward
to
hoisting
a
2
liter
boot
of
this
at
the
end
of
every
summer
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
about
a
12
inch
of
head
aroma
was
somewhat
skunky
tasted
somewhat
malty
and
decent
but
not
overpowering
flavor
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
fairly
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
can
see
why
people
drink
liters
upon
liters
of
this
stuff
its
good
im
gonna
need
some
more
pretzels
crisp
and
dry
finish
an
easy
drinking
german
classic
they
do
a
hellva
job
with
your
basic
beers
decent
price
for
a
sixer
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
one
thin
mouthfeel
decently
drinkable
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
negative
reviewers
here
are
judging
this
alongside
cedarsharp
american
ipastyle
beers
i
had
a
warsteiner
okt
last
night
after
an
ipa
style
and
found
it
odd
by
comparison
the
warsteiner
also
needs
pouring
into
a
glass
to
open
its
flavors
up
and
it
can
seem
a
tad
sharp
and
wallpapercleaner
tasting
sipped
out
of
a
bottlebut
enough
reservationsshove
them
out
of
the
way
this
is
a
very
mature
tasting
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
grain
flavors
with
moderate
sharpness
a
bare
touch
of
sweetnessbalanced
as
a
300
mont
blanc
pena
strong
as
in
nicetohave
grain
fundament
is
in
the
flavor
on
in
its
own
terms
that
is
if
it
the
first
beer
you
get
and
in
a
glass
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
autumn
i
have
tasted
no
american
okt
beer
remotely
like
this
though
i
have
to
say
it
will
not
slap
you
about
the
head
with
grapefruits
and
cedar
branches
it
will
taste
like
an
old
school
elegant
beer
i
didnt
mind
this
but
didnt
really
like
it
much
compared
to
the
other
ofest
offerings
this
might
be
the
worst
ofest
i
have
ever
tasted
and
the
high
price
makes
for
a
bad
deal
overall
not
really
recommended
taste
pretty
much
a
sweeter
less
hoppy
warsteiner
and
not
really
much
of
an
oktoberfest
light
sweet
biscuity
malts
and
mild
but
very
grassy
hops
less
of
the
hard
mineralwater
bite
than
standard
warsteiner
but
it
lurks
in
the
background
behind
the
sugary
sweetness
really
not
much
beyond
a
fairly
drinkable
eurolager
d
on
the
whole
this
is
just
a
really
middleoftheroad
beer
it
simply
doesnt
have
enough
personality
to
hold
your
interest
perhaps
the
lightest
beer
to
ever
call
itself
an
oktoberfest
that
has
crossed
my
lips
warsteiners
offering
is
really
barely
average
it
goes
ok
with
simple
food
i
guess
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
offered
but
theres
no
reason
to
seek
this
out
either

with
a
touch

not

of

cloying

drinkable
not
all
that
interesting
d
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
oktoberfest
very
mild
with
excellent
emphasis
on
the
malt
pours
a
toasted
straw
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
slight
cap
the
aroma
is
of
bready
munich
malt
with
some
peppery

quite
pils
like
the
taste
is
a
sweet
doughy
caramel
malt
spicy
noble
hop
a
touch
of
a
lime
sourness
definitely
on
the
dry
end
of
the
oktoberfest
scale
more
of
a
malty
pils
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
good
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
astringent
a
different
oktoberfest
average
cross
between
an
oktober
and
pils
easy
drinking
good
conversion
brew
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
it
has
some
taste
to
it
not
bad
presentation
packaged
in
a
330
milliliter
custom
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
just
an
average
at
best
beer
of
this
type
one
bottle
is
all
id
be
interested
inhaving
not
because
it
was
horrible
or
anything
but
it
wasnt
memorable
and
there
are
plenty
of
better
brews
of
this
style
around
pours
an
golden
orange
with
a
big
white
head
smell
is
faint
and
of
alcohol
taste
is
of
toasty
malt
quite
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonation
levels
high
pretty
drinkable
though
not
as
good
as
other
oktoberfests
sort
of
a
disapointment
warsteiners
other
beers
are
better
imo
pours
a
dark
yellowlight
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
some
sweet
notes
and
toasted
malt
an
inviting
beer
the
taste
is
similar
sweet
and
malty
not
a
huge
flavor
but
still
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
nice
and
easy
this
is
an
easy
drinker
good
beer
for
all
enjoy
d
this
is
okay
and
easy
to
take
down
probably
my
least
favorite
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
this
year
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
wasnt
enjoyable
for
the
price
i
have
no
problem
kicking
back
a
few
now
and
then
but
one
day
ill
have
some
money
and
wont
ever
have
to
drink
this
again
d
an
easy
drinker
and
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
and
at
a
good
price
too
ill
buy
this
one
again
d
this
is
a
really
good
ofest
straight
from
the
region
whos
inhabitants
started
that
crazy
party
tradition
id
drink
this
again
but
its
nothing
to
get
super
excited
about
d
i
could
celebrate
oktoberfest
with
a
gallon
of
this
stuff
that
is
if
nothing
better
was
available
i
good
beer
though
i
liked
it
buy
just
one
though
helmut
kohl
warsteiner
oktoberfest
was
very
clear
and
light
orangegold
in
color
it
had
a
white
head
decent
retention
the
aroma
with
lightly
toasted
grain
it
tasted
like
the
pilsner
with
a
little
sweet
toasted
malt
thrown
in
the
finish
was
dry
mouthfeel
was
light
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
this
beer
was
basically
an
oktoberfest
light
i
feel
compelled
to
call
this
beer
average
but
its
really
just
slightly
above
pours
a
golden
copper
color
head
is
light
and
pillowy
and
dissipates
quickly
lacing
is
thin
but
very
pronounced
and
high
on
the
glass
the
mess
is
strange
like
german
honey
and
hillsides
the
taste
is
more
slightly
bread
but
mostly
malt
is
what
you
get
here
there
is
a
strange
roundness
to
the
mouthfeel
but
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
longing
ive
had
worse
but
ive
certainly
had
much
better
try
a
single
but
pass
on
a
six
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
at
a
great
price
pours
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
breadgrain
and
malt
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
taste
has
a
honey
bready
edge
sweet
up
front
with
a
jucyfruit
finish
worth
a
try
for
sure
pretty
drinkable
while
going
down
it
does
leave
a
blandish
aftertaste
it
has
a
surprising
drinkability
for
all
the
drawbacks
still
its
not
worth
getting
this
one
when
there
are
smoother
tastier
better
examples
of
the
style
that
are
just
as
easily
attainable
not
bad
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
wouldnt
be
my
go
to
beer
for
marzen
d
this
is
pretty
much
a
middle
of
the
road
marzen
similar
to
what
i
found
in
their
helles
inexpensive
for
an
import
ill
give
it
that
but
there
are
much
more
enjoyable
and
tasty
german
examples
out
there
very
unpleasant
and
not
good
at
all
dont
even
bother
with
this
beer
really
a
poor
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
though
admittedly
im
not
a
big
marzen
fan
it
looks
like
a
classic
marzen
with
a
deep
auburn
transparent
color
that
almost
glows
in
the
late
summer
light
but
unlike
many
marzens
this
one
pours
an
outstanding
soft
white
head
that
pumps
up
to
three
fingers
deep
and
has
great
retention
over
a
leisurely
quaff
leaving
a
lovely
diffuse
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
go
through
the
head
a
soft
but
pronounced
fruity
bouquet
entices
you
to
allow
your
nose
to
linger
over
the
glass
the
flavor
on
the
palate
does
not
disappoint
with
a
malty
semisweet
character
quickly
evolving
into
pure
malt
on
the
front
and
middle
of
the
palate
but
finishing
with
a
slight
hoppy
transient
bitterness
that
subsides
to
leave
the
malt
persistent
in
the
aftertaste
the
full
smooth
mouthfeel
combines
with
a
perfect
carbonation
that
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
perfect
for
the
latesummer
waning
heat
as
the
evenings
prolong
into
the
early
autumn
coolness
a
great
seasonal
session
beer
but
with
an
abv
of
5
9
the
sessions
should
be
on
the
weekend
or
holidays
mfd
thin
bodied
crisp
and
easy
drinking
a
lot
lighter
and
less
flavorful
than
one
would
think
of
as
an
oktoberfest
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
session
all
day
sunday
while
watching
the
nfl
drinkability
average
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
struggled
with
this
one
big
time
and
gave
a
lot
of
the
bottles
i
had
away
no
thanks
drinkability
is
okay
this
beer
was
brewed
to
drink
all
day
but
it
doesnt
follow
the
general
mode
that
is
needed
too
many
hops
for
constant
drinking
light
stuff
what
a
disappointment
probably
the
worst
oktoberfest
ive
ever
had
its
a
poor
representative
of
the
style
and
not
one
ill
ever
revisit
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
light
drinkability
is
there
drinkability
ridiculously
drinkable
off
the
tap
far
better
than
the
bottled
version
instead
of
an
orangish
or
even
reddish
hue
received
a
pale
yellow
beer
with
little
head
a
faint
sweet
smell
caramel
honey
with
very
little
spices
and
no
real
hop
presence
to
speak
of
a
fairly
weak
body
with
a
mostly
hoppy
taste
some
citric
notes
come
from
this
hop
presence
but
there
is
no
spiciness
thick
caramelother
malt
taste
and
dryer
finish
that
i
assoiciate
with
a
marzen
a
rather
piddling
effort
d
its
an
okay
beer
it
would
probably
be
better
in
a
colder
season
id
try
this
again
but
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
clear
straw
yellowishorange
is
the
color
of
the
beer
topped
off
by
a
big
fizzy
head
a
little
grass
and
skunk
in
the
aroma
not
very
pleasing
fortunately
the
taste
is
okay
very
simple
lager
with
a
sweet
note
a
kick
of
alcohol
then
numbs
the
tongue
its
very
light
bodied
for
an
ofest
similar
feel
to
a
pale
lager
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
drinkabilty
well
it
was
better
than
anything
else
they
had
at
the
party
so
i
had
5
or
6
over
the
course
of
the
evening
i
wouldnt
be
seeking
this
out
on
purpose
d
a
decent
grain
bill
and
well
balanced
brew
makes
this
pretty
satisfying
i
would
have
bet
a
lot
of
money
that
i
wouldnt
run
across
a
beer
as
bad
as
warsteiner
premium
fresh
a
low
alcohol
beer
wrong
again
im
pretty
damn
sure
this
is
the
worst
oktoberfest
in
the
long
storied
history
of
oktoberfests
if
it
isnt
i
dont
want
to
taste
whatever
is
had
this
ontap
at
the
balloon
fiesta
in
albuquerque
in
06
they
had
a
large
seating
area
set
up
just
for
warsteiner
pours
golden
amber
with
a
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
nose
is
virtually
nonexistent
flavor
seemed
to
have
a
fruity
edge
to
it
and
it
seems
to
stay
on
your
mouth
for
some
time
feel
is
thick
and
frothy
definitely
drinkable
but
one
of
the
weakest
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
by
this
beer
considering
the
quality
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
year
theres
just
not
much
flavor
past
your
standard
cornmash
and
bitterish
hops
you
would
find
in
any
other
run
of
the
mill
euro
lager
this
was
maybe
a
touch
sweeter
but
it
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
on
the
thin
side
you
sould
drink
them
but
why
there
are
far
superior
oktoberfests
here
both
craft
and
german
id
pass
what
a
joy
this
brew
turned
out
to
be
i
have
not
enjoyed
a
warsteiner
like
this
before
and
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
oktoberfest
im
glad
i
stumbled
upon
it
overall
impression
wow
my
least
favorite
oktoberfest
so
far
something
funky
in
there
thats
not
clean
or
malty
cant
recommend
this
one
at
all
drinkability
while
i
usually
like
my
marzen
to
have
more
body
and
complexity
this
is
an
easy
drinking
satisfying
beer
with
balanced
flavors
and
mild
alcohol
i
could
easily
put
a
sixer
away
while
playing
the
air
tuba
oompah
oompah
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
bit
white
frothy
head
that
doesnt
leave
an
ounce
of
lacing
has
a
great
malty
smell
to
it
but
no
hops
are
present
taste
is
ok
has
a
good
clean
taste
but
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
me
its
kinda
watery
but
i
can
drink
them
all
night
long
since
its
a
realitvely
good
beer
and
is
pretty
cheap
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
easy
enough
to
drink
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
of
a
higher
carbonation
nothing
at
all
like
an
oktoberfest
the
label
is
misleading
damn
this
beer
to
hell
damn
warsteiner
to
hell
may
they
burn
forever
my
their
beer
always
be
spoiled
and
infected
i
am
actually
not
sorry
to
say
that
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
infact
were
i
you
id
not
ever
buy
this
beer
it
is
not
an
oktoberfest
it
is
warsteiner
trying
to
con
the
man
into
thinking
that
this
is
something
different
sure
all
the
fratties
that
drink
this
will
say
wow
there
is
so
much
difference
but
fuck
that
this
is
pretty
much
the
same
damned
thing
sure
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
want
something
for
fall
something
to
celebrate
slightly
cooler
temps
this
is
not
it
this
beer
is
straight
out
stupid
words
cannot
express
how
pissed
i
am
about
this
beer
basically
this
is
not
what
youre
looking
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
noone
is
looking
for
this
beer
it
completely
sucks
it
is
as
false
as
ashley
simpson
on
snl
if
not
more
drinkability
the
warsteiner
oktoberfest
is
nonoffensive
but
not
very
interesting
either
its
definitely
at
the
lighter
end
of
the
oktoberfest
spectrum
d
easy
to
drink
but
becomes
sweeter
and
sweeter
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
and
more
present
light
bodied
very
drinkable
this
is
another
oktoberfest
lite
somewhere
between
oktoberfest
and
a
regular
european
pale
lager
comment
it
was
a
nice
beer
and
complemented
the
event
well
id
like
to
try
again
with
a
glass
and
after
fewer
starter
beers
head
is
very
large
creamy
and
tasty
as
well
lacing
is
excellent
as
you
drink
the
beer
the
taste
is
the
only
true
downfall
as
it
tastes
pretty
smooth
but
a
bit
light
on
flavor
theres
also
a
slight
undertone
of
a
flavor
i
cannot
identify
that
gets
more
pronounced
the
more
you
drink
this
beer
it
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
lingering
after
taste
and
one
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
but
there
are
far
better
oktoberfest
brewers
out
there
in
my
opinion
tends
toward
a
flat
syrupy
mouthfeel
makes
it
seem
much
heavier
than
it
is
really
not
impressed
with
this
brew
and
with
so
many
other
oktoberfests
available
im
not
sure
why
youd
choose
this
one
definitely
a
product
aimed
at
americans
familiar
with
the
warsteiner
name
but
not
necessarily
classic
oktoberfests
a
nice
solid
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
i
can
detect
that
makes
this
an
octoberfest
beer
theres
a
lot
better
out
there
tastes
like
a
slightly
stronger
version
of
the
warsteiner
pils
which
is
alright
as
far
as
it
goes
but
its
not
a
very
good
oktoberfest
got
this
one
ontap
at
the
berkley
front
in
berkley
mi
poured
a
light
brownamber
color
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
on
top
no
real
lacing
nose
was
mild
a
touch
of
spicy
malt
taste
was
similar
although
it
had
a
little
bit
more
to
it
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
then
some
ginger
spiciness
in
the
middle
a
very
light
hop
character
came
through
at
the
end
feel
was
a
little
thin
but
with
fairly
good
carbonation
this
one
wasnt
bad
although
im
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
robust
oktoberfests
this
year
had
this
brew
on
tap
last
evening
and
was
my
only
mistake
of
the
evening
the
brew
poured
to
a
light
golden
color
with
an
amber
hue
had
hardly
any
head
and
left
no
real
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malts
leading
to
a
sweet
scent
the
taste
is
very
grainy
and
not
in
a
good
way
mixed
with
a
somewhat
sweet
taste
from
the
malt
the
flavor
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
this
is
not
a
very
good
brew
and
i
feel
a
pretty
poor
octoberfest
compaired
to
hackerpshorr
and
paulaner
on
tap
a
pint
at
pizza
plant
fresh
with
abundant
lace
and
white
head
apple
juice
appearance
of
body
taste
is
a
bit
complex
with
fruity
toasty
nutty
malty
character
nothing
tremendous
fizzy
carbonation
detracted
ayinger
was
superior
vertical
on
octoberfest
a
decent
beer
at
best
but
there
are
most
definitely
better
versions
out
there
produced
both
here
and
in
germany
pours
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
thin

and
some
herbal
hop
bitterness
quite
light
for
the
style
not
terrible
but
there
are
better
oktoberfests
to
be
had
one
of
the
many
beers
i
got
to
sample
at
the
oktoberfest
zinzinnati
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
medium
brown
in
color
but
appeared
to
be
fairly
clear
drinking
out
of
plastic
fest
cups
so
difficult
to
get
a
full
read
on
the
appearance
smell
was
nice
lightly
hopped
semisweet
aroma
flavor
had
a
nice
slightly
malty
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
very
easy
drinking
and
light
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
german
macro
oktoberfest
certainly
not
as
complex
of
a
malt
profile
as
other
offerings
but
certainly
drinkable
this
oky
sets
itself
apart
from
others
in
style
i
sampled
this
beer
at
the
virginia
beach
octoberfest
on
oct
16th
disappointed
that
the
beers
were
served
in
opaque
plastic
cups
sorta
guessing
at
the
color
but
it
looked
amber
colored
and
clear
as
much
as
i
could
see
it
nice
head
typical
carbonation
and
good
head
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
very
comparable
to
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
i
enjoyed
last
week
the
mouthfeel
was
just
right
light
but
not
watery
with
no
aftertaste
other
than
a
good
beer
taste
i
would
drinkg
this
beer
again
enjoyable
either
for
sipping
or
as
a
session
beer
had
in
a
1
liter
glass
at
brewery
night
at
the
flying
saucer
feeling
pretty
good
after
that
one
bar
was
darkish
so
hard
to
tell
color
but
looked
golden
had
a
light
bouquet
small
head
but
not
sure
how
long
it
sat
before
being
delivered
and
some
carbonation
overall
had
a
good
taste
with
a
slight
bitter
taste
at
the
end
good
but
not
great
beer
avery
kaiser
kicks
its
butt
a
very
nice
beer
not
overly
complicated
not
outstanding
just
pure
and
simple
a
goldencopper
crystal
clear
hue
moderately
carbonated
and
forms
a
12
white
head
with
a
little
lacing
smells
softly
of
barley
malt
caramel
toffee
and
spiciness
flavors
of
classic
german
pilsner
flavors
with
a
little
toasty
quality
throw
in
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
spicy
with
added
noble
hops
no
off
flavors
body
is
medium
and
airy
finish
is
fleeting
but
not
dry
or
abrupt
very
clean
and
crisp
a
well
brewed
beer
but
not
a
favorite
among
high
gravity
lovers
a
special
keg
at
the
royal
falconer
in
riverside
ca
to
commemorate
oktoberfest
this
beer
had
a
goldenorange
translucent
color
with
14
inch
white
head
that
quickly
settles
aroma
is
very
slight
was
expecting
more
but
the
flavor
made
up
for
it
malty
creamy
orange
sode
like
with
incredible
drinkability
slight
hop
kick
at
the
end
just
enough
to
keep
interesting
oktoberfest
beers
are
not
generally
complex
or
overpowering
but
they
are
so
bloody
drinkable
and
this
is
a
very
good
example
one
of
my
favorite
ofests
this
year
and
last
year
this
is
a
dumbeddown
bier
and
a
classic
example
of
how
a
very
large
brewery
can
lose
track
of
taste
and
concentrate
on
mass
producing
pours
the
colour
of
tea
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
smell
is
of
malt
with
some
caramel
notes
taste
is
average
nothing
to
get
excited
about
very
easy
drinking
however
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
marzen
overall
this
beer
is
not
in
the
top
10
must
drink
oktoberfest
this
probably
is
along
the
lines
of
becks
ofest
a
mediocre
attempt
by
a
huge
brewer
to
sell
an
oktoberfest
this
came
with
an
inch
and
half
head
over
a
nice
golden
colored
brew
the
was
a
slight
smell
of
malt
but
not
much
else
this
tastes
malty
and
sweet
its
a
very
light
beer
and
quite
drinkable
however
i
expected
a
little
more
from
warsteiner
in
there
oktoberfest
after
so
many
oktoberfests
this
season
the
warsteiner
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
not
a
terrible
beer
its
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
either
quaffable
yes
but
nevertheless
one
of
the
least
inspired
german
festbiers
ive
tried
this
golden
brew
had
good
head
retention
and
some
nice
crusty
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
a
decent
lager
but
off
the
mark
as
a
fest
i
was
looking
for
a
deeper
color
and
a
lot
more
maltiness
the
bitterness
was
there
but
it
left
a
bit
of
pasty
dryness
where
i
was
looking
for
some
malt
body
not
bad
lighter
than
most
oktoberfests
many
are
a
medium
to
dark
brown
or
even
a
nice
cherry
stain
color
this
one
was
dark
tannishgold
with
a
small
white
head
ther
was
some
mild
sweet
malt
under
the
herbally
hops
in
the
aroma
tastes
a
lot
like
regular
warsteiner
except
there
is
a
light
caramelly
malt
sweetness
added
into
the
mix
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
but
seems
a
little
light
for
style
light
transparent
honey
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
low
sweet
malt
aroma
flavor
is
a
light
sweet
malt
with
doughey
highlights
and
hints
of
flowers
light
hoppy
finish
and
a
lingering
sweet
flowery
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
crisp
not
blown
away
at
first
but
im
warming
up
to
it
the
more
i
sip
the
more
flavors
that
rise
up
out
of
it
one
of
the
best
of
the
very
traditional
german
oktoberfest
beers
an
absolutely
spectacular
octoberfest
marzen
in
the
lighter
true
german
style
not
the
heavier
darker
sytle
brewed
for
american
tastes
incredibly
clean
pronounced
flavors
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfest
beers
so
far
on
draught
at
the
german
village
oktoberfest
i
guess
this
is
a
newer
offering
from
warsteiner
and
isnt
a
terrible
attempt
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
more
hops
than
malt
in
the
aroma
which
is
kind
of
a
change
in
this
style
for
me
mediumbodied
and
almost
overcarbonated
with
the
hop
profile
dominating
although
the
malt
begins
to
assert
itself
a
little
more
on
the
backswing
the
finish
is
rather
slick
this
isnt
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
does
the
job
nicely
on
a
cold
oktoberfest
evening
in
the
glass
a
translucent
golden
amber
color
with
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
its
texture
the
color
a
bright
white
lace
forms
a
decent
sheet
upon
the
glass
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
crisp
and
clean
start
is
sweet
top
is
skeletal
in
its
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
is
crisply
acidic
hops
pertinent
to
the
style
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
average
at
best
light
chesnut
color
lighter
than
most
ofest
brews
however
the
europeans
and
in
particular
the
germans
do
well
to
brew
light
colored
beers
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
one
fits
into
that
catagory
not
deviating
from
the
syle
the
emphasis
is
on
the
malt
here
it
takes
on
a
caramel
bready
character
then
shifts
to
nutty
and
spicy
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
on
the
mark
a
respectable
ofest
brew
enjoyed
tonight
at
the
local
oktoberfest
prosit
now
i
know
you
think
im
kidding
but
the
nose
on
this
beer
was
stale
cigarette
ashes
and
im
not
kidding
i
went
back
to
it
several
times
and
that
is
as
accurate
as
i
can
possibly
be
cigarette
ashes
the
look
is
pale
gold
and
out
of
style
but
the
flavor
is
semisweet

a

not

toasted

the
beer
a
tasty
classic
flavor
that
could
go
down
by

the
aroma
gets
lost
from
the
poor
head
retention
but
this
one
makes
up
for
it
in
flavor
do
this
is
a
traditional
fullflavored
marzen
that
does
not
look
to
step
outside
familiar
terrain
its
midrange
abv
and
maltcentered
flavors
are
palatefriendly
promising
to
play
nicely
alongside
savory
foods
or
in
them
as
an
ingredient
overall
a
lackluster
attempt
at
a
popular
lager
style
by
a
brewery
that
i
thought
has
a
solid
reputation
for
brewing
solid
lager
beers
im
surprised
that
this
is
5
5
abv
drinks
much
lighter
than
that
wouldnt
revisit
this
good
thing
i
have
only
one
bottle
okay
so
i
like
this
beer
and
most
offerings
from
capital
but
do
you
ever
think
that
most
capital
beers
taste
about
the
same
i
realize
i
am
not
a
top
notch
beer
taste
tester
but
it
seems
like
this
was
almost
the
same
beer
as
their
summerfest
and
it
wasnt
much
different
than
their
winter
skal
which
i
had
right
after
finishing
an
oktoberfest
i
guess
if
i
really
had
to
discriminate
this
one
was
a
little
bit
heavier
and
spicier
than
the
summerfest
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
ontop
from
growlers
and
from
the
bottle
it
is
a
great
session
beer
and
i
although
the
components
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
incredible
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
very
good
overall
drinkable
and
light
but
not
otherwise
especially
distinctive
id
much
rather
something
a
little
more
flavorful
than
this
for
the
descending
gloom
of
a
wisconsin
autumn
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
trying
othere
are
better
ones
out
there
way
above
leinies
but
just
below
points
in
terms
of
flavor
drinkability
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
i
suppose
i
would
guzzle
it
if
the
polka
was
loud
enough
notes
slightly
thin
and
moderate
in
body
this
beer
is
solid
and
quite
drinkable
however
its
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
decent
and
at
least
worth
a
try
fairly
standard
oktoberfest
here
clean
and
simple

clean
mouth
feel
is
fairly

smooth
medium

with
zesty

o
a
pretty
solid
marzen
offering
its
worth
an
autumn
tasting
its
fanatsy
draft
and
the
oktober
fest
beers
are
in
full
force
the
capital
brewery
oktoberfest
is
is
a
good
beer
the
appearance
is
a
rich
copperamber
very
thin
head
if
any
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
has
some
sweet
maltiness
to
it
the
tast
definitely
has
a
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smoot
and
easily
could
be
sessioned
certainly
worth
a
try
for
all
those
okto
fans
this
is
a
fairly
average
oktoberfest
a
bit
disappointing
considering
the
brewery
its
coming
from
with
a
number
of
other
german
breweries
to
choose
from
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
over
any
and

bitter
and
harsh
feeling
at
times
with
too
much
of
yeasty
presence
as
well
this
ofest
really
left
me
disappointed
especially
considering
the
brewery
that
made
it
now
i
did
like
the
body
on
this
as
it
at
least
kept
things
crisp
and
smooth
but
the
profiles
here
just
needed
some
cleaning
up
not
sure
if
i
just
got
an
off
bottle
or
what
id
be
willing
to
give
this
another
go
sometime
down
the
road
it
drinks
fine
the
alcohol
doesnt
make
itself
known
the
problem
is
that
there
really
isnt
enough
flavor
to
cause
me
to
pick
it
up
again
d
this
was
a
nice
one
to
try
among
the
many
marzens
this
season
but
nothing
that
i
would
get
in
larger
quantities
than
a
single
brew
taste
is
some
light
biscuit
malt
and
a
very
mild
amount
of
caramel
and
toffee
pretty
plain
there
are
some
light
earthy
and
floral
characteristics
in
the
background
light
creamy
character
the
feel
is
a
bit
light
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
and
simple
beer
without
any
flaws
though
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
thanks
to
florida9
for
this
one
i
poured
from
a
bottle
to
sa
perfect
pint
glass
clear
copper
pour
with
a
sticky
2
inch
white
head
lots
of
bready
malt
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
bready
and
sweet
with
a
lingering
bitterness
full
in
body
and
well
carbonated
a
typical
marzen
very
enjoyable
overall
after
trying
the
wheat
beer
from
capitol
brewery
didnt
like
it
im
very
impressed
and
would
drink
again
might
even
stop
by
the
brewery
at
uw
now
the
brewery
is
a
short
drive
away
d
not
a
classic
but
a
tasty
rendition
of
an
oktoberfest
this
bier
is
a
medium
copper
color
and
is
crystal
clear
it
has
very
little
carbonation
and
the
head
vanishes
quickly
the
aroma
and
taste
are
nicely
malted
sweet
and
uncomplicated
they
have
a
great
flavor
indicative
to
the
style
without
a
bunch
of
other
notes
thrown
just
straight
yummy
goodness
very
smooth
with
the
right
amount
of
flavor
lingering
a
must
repeat
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
im
wondering
if
i
got
a
leaky
bottle
because
it
seems
extremely
low
in
carbonation
and
the
slick
mouthfeel
is
almost
as
if
its
going
flat
i
like
the
beer
and
its
drinkable
just
not
sure
this
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
but
im
willing
to
try
it
again
d
pretty
much
a
standard
oktoberfest
nothing
spectacular
but
a
decent
drinking
beer
if
you
like
the
style
youll
like
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
a
beige
collar
and
lacing
smell
is
malts
grain
spices
and
hops
a
little
caramel
and
some
roasted
flavors
taste
is
much
the
same
its
malts
both
sweet
and
roasted
with
some
hops
some
spice
in
there
mouth
feel
is
lighter
then
most
of
but
it
had
flavor
not
the
best
of
but
it
held
its
own
it
was
drinkable
but
alas
forgettable
also
with
lots
of
of
to
choose
from
try
it
though
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
think
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
best
oktoberfest
i
have
had
this
year
d
3
5
had
the
hacker
ofest
earlier
today
and
i
think
i
will
probably
ultimately
prefer
that
one
to
capitals
offering
yet
is
this
one
worth
trying
absolutely
particularly
if
you
want
a
hoppy
take
on
the
style
drinkability
one
of
the
better
marzens
out
there
although
style
wise
it
leans
a
little
closer
to
a
bitter
vienna
more
than
solid
autumn
brew
one
of
the
best
domestic
ofests
and
up
there
with
the
best
german
styles
for
my
money
pours
a
clear
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hops
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
marzenoktoberfest
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
yeast
and
sweet
malt
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
with
a
good
blend
toastycaramel
flavors
up
front
and
a
tasteful
hop
prickle
at
the
finish
good
carbonation
tailed
with
this
bitterness
to
provide
some
texture
to
a
very
quaffable
and
slick
brew
the
hop
flavor
contribution
is
very
nice
balanced
yet
assertive
and
tasty
overall
d
good
i
would
be
interested
in
another
and
maybe
a
sixer
if
nothing
else
could
be
had
the
mouthfeel
definitely
felt
a
tad
thin
and
watery
i
felt
the
flavors
were
well
done
but
the
overall
texture
of
the
beer
leaned
towards
watery
which
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
overall
it
is
another
solid
oktoberfest
beer
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
light
would
like
more
depth
here
but
still
good
carbonation
is
light
but
helps
with
the
sweetness
into
the
finish
overall
a
limited
ofest
i
know
my
preferences
are
usually
more
of
munich
style
ofest
so
i
will
try
not
to
skew
this
to
badly
very
nice
yeast
character
though
still
very
good
beer
highly
drinkable
and
worth
buying
more
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonaton
and
a
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
d
the
low
alcohol
is
a
big
redeeming
factor
there
are
other
ofests
that
id
take
first
but
it
were
the
only
thing
left
in
the
fridge
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of
sweetness
more
than
i
care
for
bready
and
sweet
with
sugar
brown
sugar
and
fruit
character
plums
and
raisins
the
finish
is
a
semidry
with
a
mild
bitterness
hop
character
is
a
bit
lower
than
it
need
be
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
overdone
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
sweetish
finish
thats
not
the
best
while
i
have
no
problems
drinking
this
i
hoped
for
more
from
this
brewery
ive
been
on
a
oktoberfest
kick
since
theres
an
ass
load
of
them
coming
out
right
now
so
heres
another
it
pours
an
amber
orange
color
fairly
clear
with
a
decent
inch
of
off
white
head
a
smattering
of
lace
is
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
spice
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
if
you
sniff
real
hard
im
starting
to
realize
american
oktoberfest
beers
dont
have
a
huge
boquet
on
them
the
flavor
is
pleasant
malt
and
caramel
with
some
hop
bite
and
mild
sweet
fruit
that
hangs
in
there
at
the
end
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
yet
another
decent
offering
from
capital
not
exactly
a
head
turner
but
a
easily
drinkable
session
beer
for
the
masses
glad
i
rereviewed
this
beer
since
it
taste
so
much
better
fresh
it
has
a
light
malty
well
balanced
flavor
nothing
less
should
be
expected
from
a
capital
lager
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
watery
for
me
but
still
good
a
well
done
oktoberfest
that
is
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
would
definitely
get
this
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
oktoberfest
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
d
the
beer
is
pretty
smooth
and
rather
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
d
would
make
a
great
session
beer
man
i
thought
these
guys
could
do
no
wrong
with
the
lagers
but
this
baby
is
subpar
the
aroma
reminds
me
more
of
a
strong
euro
lager
for
the
unpleasant
lager
tang
smell
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
and
at
least
finishes
with
a
pleasant
subtle
hop
bitter
but
for
the
most
part
the
malts
come
on
too
strong
and
hot
the
end
result
is
unpleasant
and
i
hope
whatevers
going
on
with
this
beer
gets
fixed
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
it
really
doesnt
give
off
that
much
aromas
really
have
to
get
a
good
sniff
to
notice
some
caramel
and
hints
of
fruits
i
taste
caramel
and
breads
initially
but
after
a
few
sips
i
notice
plenty
of
spices
this
would
not
be
described
as
a
fullflavored
octo
which
makes
it
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
hv
because
of
the
low
carbonation
i
would
probably
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
flavors
with
a
few
off
notes
like
the
twang
hint
and
the
nougat
that
both
start
to
grow
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
a
decent
oktoberfest
a
bit
different
than
normal
crystal
clear
amber
in
color
with
average
off
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
nice
citrusy
aroma
flavor
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
as
it
went
down
great
tasting
beer
mediumheavy
body
with
average
carbonation
very
drinkable
d
i
like
a
little
more
stank
on
my
beers
but
this
is
a
serviceable
average
ofest
that
i
can
imagine
is
very
popular
for
the
casual
beer
drinker
i
might
introduce
my
bud
light
loving
dad
and
brother
to
this
easy
going
brew
nothing
about
this
one
is
bad
its
just
underpowered
and
a
bit
boring
to
be
honest
but
it
does
make
it
a
little
more
assertive
good
get
some
if
you
can
spicy
raw
cut
of
hops
and
resinous
vine
in
the
aroma
quaff
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
without
a
major
flavor
player
and
the
body
also
is
a
bit
weak
seems
to
be
a
decent
octo
brew
just
in
need
of
a
stronger
hop
finish
good
for
a
couple
to
try
but
ill
stick
with
the
local
missouri
octos
in
the
future
this
is
my
first
beer
report
i
love
this
site
and
i
will
continue
to
contribute
my
opinions
on
many
great
beers
a
great
session
beer
easy
enough
drinking
but
overall
a
boring
example
of
an
oktoberfest
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
went
well
with
my
dinner
of
brats
and
asparagus
capital
oktoberfest
poured
a
light
amber
very
orange
looking
color
small
head
smell
was
strong
of
hops
and
bit
of
malt
taste
was
sweet
caramel
and
malt
upfront
followed
by
a
mild
hop
bite
it
became
sweeter
as
it
warmed
mouthfeel
was
ok
bit
light
for
what
i
like
in
a
ofest
drinkability
is
very
good
easy
to
drink
a
few
overall
a
pretty
good
ofest
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
not
the
best
out
there
but
still
a
decent
oktoberfest
i
normally
dont
like
capital
brews
but
this
may
be
the
best
one
ive
tried
yet
aroma
is
a
bit
too
delicate
but
this
could
be
just
mer
i
like
more
in
your
face
aromas
it
still
shows
toasted
malts
which
open
to
a
relatively
light
beer
predominantly
malty
but
with
some
intervening
hops
clean
reasonably
tasty
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
good
not
great
domestic
oktoberfest
grab
some
this
fall
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
im
buying
more
of
this
when
i
can
a
solid
offering
i
enjoyed
it
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
on
an
amber
body
smelled
very
sweet
with
caramel
and
perhaps
honey
dominating
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
with
the
caramel
being
fairly
light
and
a
very
very
nice
sweetness
as
the
end
hoppiness
kept
to
a
minimum
this
is
typically
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
in
fact
oktobers
generally
are
a
bit
depressing
as
it
usually
mean
summers
over
but
ive
had
a
few
of
this
style
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
d
definitely
a
great
drinker
very
tasty
its
a
good
newworld
brew
but
i
prefer
the
malt
hops
in
the
fatherland
d
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
example
its
on
the
mellow
side
of
the
octoberfest
style
but
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
would
be
perfect
pint
after
pint
note
i
got
the
best
deal
ever
on
this
stuff
from
a
major
retailer
that
recently
started
carrying
alcohol
when
i
hit
the
checkout
it
rang
up
as
27
per
6pack
due
to
a
misship
they
had
ordered
a
different
variety
but
received
the
seasonal
stuff
and
they
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
i
figured
id
help
them
out
and
i
went
back
and
grabbed
the
last
two
off
the
shelf
a
good
looking
amber
almost
red
fest
beer
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
a
good
amount
of
foam
is
generated
with
the
pour
as
the
head
falls
just
a
few
little
bits
of
foam
stick
to
the
sides
a
few
sips
in
and
all
that
remains
of
the
once
voluminous
head
is
a
fine
collar
of
bubbles
theres
lots
of
malt
and
a
nutty
character
in
the
aroma
as
time
goes
on
i
notice
a
slight
vegetal
note
which
is
a
bit
unappealing
however
this
is
pleasant
tasting
light
bodied
beer
with
light
caramel
flavors
accented
by
some
nuttiness
and
a
slightly
sweet
but
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
enhances
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
good
head
and
a
deep
amber
with
only
a
few
bubbles
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
inviing
malty
grain
the
taste
is
even
more
sweet
grainy
very
light
and
offsetting
hops

in

that
is
on

for

finish
is

dry
and
long
overall
good
but
not
great
i
am
an
outlier
because
i
prefer
beers
in
the
style
of
oktoberfests
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
i
have
had
or
can
remember
at
the
moment
it
is
good
from
the
first
sip
until
the
bottle
is

no
awkward
initial
tastes

the
palate
adjusts
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the

it
was
pretty
refreshing
i
think
its
summery
one
of
the
smoothest
oktoberfests
ive
ever
had
with
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
whatsoever
danka

easy

still
flavorful
but
not
all
that

sometimes
watery

not

in

you
can
still
taste
the
years

maybe
decent
enough
for
some

sessions
thats
for
sure
wanted
to
give
this
beer
a

to
be
honest

picked
up
a

and
was

had
easily
ranks
with
my
top
two
or
three
examples
this
is
one
that
i
will
seek
out
more
aggressively
next
fest
season
this
is
clearly
one
of
the
bestmarzens
o
a
very
good
flavorful
refreshing
beer
made
for
drinking
a
lot
of
it
outdoors
on
a
cool
sunny
autumn
day
no
flash
just
substance
cant
go
wrong
overall
this
is
a
big
wonderful
beer
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
sweet
bold
malt
is
complemented
by
the
mild
dry
hops
delicious
light
amber
in
color
with
great
clarity
nice
fluffy
white
head
and
great
lacing
down
the
glass
aromas
of
honey
clean
husky
grains
sweet
malt
floral
hops
and
raisin
aromas
are
faint
but
worth
the
effort
to
pull
out
taste
is
malt
forward
with
some
of
that
honey
and
a
floral
presence
up
front
sweetness
from
the
malt
barely
kept
in
check
by
the
hops
floral
and
spicy
in
there
own
right
finish
brings
sweet
malty
notes
and
some
of
that
raisin
and
fig
from
the
nose
light
yet
chewy
body
costs
the
palet
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
ive
had
yet
lovely
malt
flavors
compliment
the
season
and
stay
true
to
the
style
overall
i
always
say
germans
make
the
best
oktoberfest
and
this
is
another
that
stands
up
to
the
phrase
definitely
will
be
enjoying
more
of
these
it
has
been
some
time
since
the
last
one
great
octoberfest
beer
malt
sweetness
tastes
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
good
thick
mouthfull
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
it
was
great
with
knockwurst
and
german
pretzels
that
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
buy
to
accompany
it
if
you
want
to
have
a
little
backyard
octoberfest
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
or
make
some
german
food
to
go
with
it
good
pairing
is
knockwurst
red
cabbage
and
fresh
made
german
pretzels
overall
i
thought
it
was
too
floral
at
first
but
it
keeps
things
interesting
and
its
extremely
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
goldenamber
color
lager
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
clean
cereal
notes
with
light
grainy
notes
taste
is
dominated
by
clean
cereal
notes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
some
light
grainy
notes
also
noticeable
body
is
above
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
simple
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
balance
overall
cheers
again
it
was
okay
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
an
oktoberfest
i
will
pick
up
another
brand
overall
wonderful
fullflavored
oktoberfest
beer
one
of
my
two
favorites
of
the
style
along
with
hackerpschorr
as
someone
else
mentioned
its
great
to
drink
a
liter
and
taste
the
changes
as
it
warms
also
very
good
in
a
bottle
as
long
as
its
not
too
old
though
draft
is
best
deep
brilliant
golden
hue
with
brilliant
clarity
ba
wisp
of
white
foam
barely
covers
half
of
the
top
of
the
beer
i
smell
doughybready
malt
and
a
bit
of
salt
the
flavor
is
sourdough
bread
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
crisp
o
solid
and
classic
oktoberfest
i
would
def
get
this
again
highly
recommended
for
anyone
wanted
to
be
introduced
to
this
more
than
worthy
style
3840
this
is
exceptionally
clean
easydrinking
and
still
fullflavored
a
great
beer
4

yep
was
expecting
more
tastes
more
like
a
traditional
well
made
german
lager
than
a
marzen
surprised
that
i
like
the
american
examples
better
especially
since
other
ayinger
brews
are
top
notch
overall
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
i
guess
for
good
reason
its
an
actual
german
marzen
prost
in
summary
i
just
dont
feel
the
oktober
love
from
this
beer
it
lacks
a
lot
of
the
full
bodyfull
flavor
characteristics
that
one
expects
from
an
oktoberfest
beer
radiant
orange
body
with
a
small
white
cap
aromas
of
lager
yeast
subtle
spice
fruity
malt
smells
true
to
style
clean
and
easy
drinking
a
good
oktoberfest
bier
is
a
thing
of
beauty
its
that
time
of
year
a
solid
german
brew
nicely
done
fest
bier
o
4
25
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
for
the
style
interesting
and
satisfying
without
being
too
heavy
great
for
the
transition
into
winter
90
a
overall
a
very
good
marzen
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
youre
going
to
have
it
i
say
go
german
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
o
a
solid
beer
but
oktoberfest
isnt
my
goto
style
good
for
what
it
is
though
big
flavorcaramelized
malt
is
pronounced
toasty
warm
creamy
mouthfeel
a
great
fest
bier
this
has
gotta
be
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
very
good
good
amount
of
lacing
which
disappears
quickly
clean
and
spicy
smell
caramel
and
honey
taste
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
beer
my
first
real
oktoberfest
and
i
am
impressed
a
deep
and
satisfying
german
fest
beer
flavors
and
aroma
are
wellrounded
and
complement
each
other
nicely
couple
that
with
a
dynamite
appearance
and
you
have
one
appealing
and
satisfying
beer
highly
recommended
medium
body
and
low
medium
carbonation
creamy
clean
well
balanced
very
good
marzen
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
i
only
wish
the
abv
was
a
little
higher
because
one
pint
bottle
isnt
enough
o
never
really
got
into
october
fest
marzen
beers
so
i
went
down
to
the
local
craft
beer
store
for
a
marzen
tasting
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
heavy
yeasty
very
breadlike
and
it
wasnt
i
found
it
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
i
definitely
will
start
drinking
more
beers
like
this
overall
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
what
i
imagine
when
i
think
octoberfest
its
just
a
wonderfully
balanced
super
flavorful
malt
bomb
maybe
its
most
impressive
quality
is
its
semisweet
bready
malt
nature
that
somehow
remains
very
drinkable
and
noncloying
delicious
liquid
bread
clear
light
amber
pour
with
a
hint
of
garnet
massive
head
with
excellent
lacing
and
retention
the
nose
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
caramel
over
a
faint
almost
citric
spiciness
nice
light
medium
body
with
a
slick
smooth
texture
that
approaches
creamy
slightly
above
normal
carbonation
with
a
good
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
a
bit
complex
and
very
well
balanced
the
sweet
malt
flavors
are
there
but
not
to
the
extent
that
they
are
overpowering
it
begins
with
sweet
biscuit
flows
to
a
caramel
note
and
then
the
effervescence
cleans
the
palate
and
allows
the
complexity
to
escape
the
middle
presents
a
multitude
of
subtle
flavors
citric
dark
fruit
light
bitterness
and
spicy
hops
the
smooth
finish
leaves
you
with
a
blend
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
glad
i
finally
got
to
enjoy
this
classic
delicious
a
very
orderly
beer
that
is
uniform
in
its
particular
and
pleasant
qualities
perplexing
i
only
had
a
glass
of
great
lakes
okto
previous
to
this
so
a
mixed
up
palate
doesnt
seem
likely
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
had
two
but
will
have
to
find
a
bottle
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
an
excellent
marten
style
german
lager
very
drinkable
and
true
to
style
classic
light
amber
color
generous
carbonation
and
nice
lacing
a
bready
carmel
malt
smell
in
the
glass
and
translated
directly
to
the
palate
medium
body
malty
with
a
very
unusual
hop
spiciness
that
was
almost
metalliclike
nobody
makes
an
octoberfest
like
the
barvarians
and
ayinger
is
right
in
the
mix
delish
overall

slightly
toasted

easy

overall
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
for
sure
regardless
of
style
though
this
is
slightly
sweeter
than
i
generally
prefer
but
for
the
style
its
definitely
more
balanced
than
some
american
counterparts
and
even
some
german
ones
very
good

all
around

one
worth
making

very

a
pretty
goldenamber
in

with
a
good
3finger
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
good
2mm
layer
on
top
of
the
brew
and
more
on
the

a
decent
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each

that
sticks
to
the

perfect

the

is
mostly
of
sweet

for
the
most

even
has
more
going

with
the
sweet

with
some

with
very
mild
hop
finish
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
mix
as
well
very
easy
to

and
smooth
medium
bodied
one
of
the
best
marzen
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
tasted
as
i
am
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
brew
style
a
exception
here
for
sure
prosit
classic
in
taste
poured
a
beautiful
medium
golden
amber
color
topping
itself
off
with
a
rich
creamy
head
which
then
settled
down
to
a
12
finger
very
inviting
to
the
eye
as
well
to
the
nose
a
classic
marzen
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
light
bready
toasted
malt
with
a
nice
hop
finish
all
in
all
a
nice
full
body
and
the
right
balance
of
sweet
and
bitterness
very
enjoyable
a
true
oktoberfest
that
is
best
served
in
a
stein
under
a
beer
garden
tent
with
your
friends
prost
i
dont
think
i
can
appreciate
this
style
but
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
beer
very
bready
and
it
was
smooth
i
probably
wont
revisit
the
oktoberfest
style
i
love
ayinger
but
this
was
not
nearly
the
best
that
they
make
it
wasnt
unpleasant
by
any
means
but
i
didnt
have
a
wow
moment
bottle
this
is
probably
my
favorite
octoberfest
beer
very
tasty
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
easily

only
thing
missing
is
the
friggen
beer
hall
ok
nothing
special
well
crafted
but
decidedly
mild
overall
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
is
positive
having
a
full
bodied
taste
with
the
right
balance
of
sweet
and
bitterness
the
only
downside
was
the
lack
of
the
aroma
overall
this
is
in
my
top
few
for
oktoberfest
style
great
malt
flavor
and
full
body
had
a
1
pint
tall
bottle
that
i
purchased
perhaps
a
month
ago
i
kept
it
ice
cold
and
ready
for
when
an
amber
malt
craving
struck
poured
a
color
reminiscent
of
dark
honey
like
a
yellow
to
orange
sunset
with
a
creamy
head
that
broke
quite
quickly
aroma
was
marvelously
fruity
and
spicy
with
ample
aromatic
malt
character
taste
was
a
layered
blend
of
caramel
and
cherry
fruit
floral
vanilla
a
darker
malt
note
like
faint
molasses
and
herbal
hops
that
recall
black
tea
semichewy
body
but
not
that
much
residual
sweetness
just
enough
to
balance
some
spice
that
replaces
the
sweet
malts
and
fruit
for
the
finish
the
whole
flavor
palette
integrates
as
you
drink
and
yet
the
individual
components
become
more
salient
as
well
i
love
beers
that
actually
reveal
more
of
themselves
as
you
proceed
a
prime
example
of
how
complex
and
aromatic
a
wellcrafted
lager
can
be
maltforward
but
with
enough
fruit
and
spice
from
yeast
and
hops
to
provide
balance
and
nuance
i
am
a
bit
of
a
luddite
when
it
comes
to
beer
proreinheitsgebot
when
it
comes
to
nonbelgian
offerings
and
this
sort
of
brew
gives
me
strength
overall
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
that
i
would
highly
recommend
plus
a
cool
bottle
cap
to
boot
would
highly
recommend
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
brauerei
aying
o
its
difficult
to
describe
the
best
beers
of
specific
german
styles
because
these
are
the
beers
you
base
other
versions
of
the
style
from
this
is
exactly
how
i
expect
want
and
need
an
oktoberfestmarzen
to
taste
smell
and
satisfy
i
could
drink
mug
upon
mug
of
this
tasty
stuff
i
believe
i
paid
only
about
3
35
for
this
bottle
one
of
the
cheaper
offerings
at
my
local
exotic
beer
emporium
not
quite
so
definitely
a
good
bargain
for
the
quality
and
a
good
try
overall
a
great
german
marzen
that
really
showcases
the
noble
hops
rather
than
malt
character
very
balanced
still
thought
with
a
crisp
finish
o
good
brew
well
balanced
m
a
bit
light
and
a
bit
over
carbonated
pleasant
grain
overall
3

not
the
best
october
fest
as
the
folks
at
ayinger
spell
it
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
pretty
darn
good
maerzen
more
subdued
and
slightly
flavorless
compared
to
other
oktoberfests
i
have
had
this
brew
also
features
a
slightly
smaller
abv
regardless
i
do
not
regret
picking
it
up
and
it
certainly
would
serve
to
remind
one
of
why
one
loves
a
maerzen
when
no
other
maerzen
is
available
the
feel
is
full
but
a
little
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
d
its
nice
to
have
something
calm
every
once
and
a
while
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
memorable
i
dont
want
to
drag
down
an
authentic
and
well
crafted
oktoberfest
but
i
cant
praise
it
much
more
than
that
due
to
its
uncomplicated
and
not
overly
appealing
for
my
taste
nature
rjt
o
this
is
one
style
that
usually
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
this
beer
is
textbook
its
true
to
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
out
there
overall
phenomenal
beer
for
the
style
and
great
when
in
season
were
i
in
germany
for
oktoberfest
id
easily
put
back
several
big
ol
boots
full
of
this
with
some
softbaked
pretzels
o
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
comparing
this
to
some
of
my
favorite
us
examples
of
the
style
i
definatly
get
the
purity
law
in
action
there
is
always
a
distinct
german
lager
flavor
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
and
this
has
it
extremely
drinkable
flavor
rich
makes
me
want
to
drink
a
full
liter
prost
o
delicious
satisfying
and
extremely
sessionable
everything
you
want
in
an
oktoberfestmärzen
this
is
a
very
solid
german
offering
and
probably
some
of
the
best
of
this
style
you
can
get
in
the
states
definitely
pick
this
up
when
its
out
if
you
like
this
style
o
solid
offering
nothing
out
of
the
world
about
this
but
there
is
not
a
single
thing
wrong
here
each
and
every
component
is
done
correctly
the
whole
package
is
superbly
put
together
in
its
balance
and
complementary
nature
it
is
a
very
very
good
beer
that
goes
down
well
and
represents
a
marzen
superbly
overall
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
often
just
because
im
not
crazy
about
the
marzen
style
but
its
great
to
have
during
oktoberfest
season
easily
the
best
marzen
ive
had
to
date
o
good
representation
of
the
style
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
not
overpowering
in
any
sense
but
enough
is
there
on
the
initial
malt
and
hop
back
to
produce
a
solid
beer
o
a
good
oktoberfest
probably
my
favorite
german
offering
o
outstanding
although
this
style
lacks
the
complexity
and
intensity
to
achieve
a
very
high
rating
as
good
as
any
bottled
märzen
i
can
remember
and
likely
the
best
bottled
example
of
a
german
oktoberfest
youll
find
in
the
u
s
light
copper
and
clear
with
a
nice
head
of
light
ecru
foam
very
smooth
yet
not
too
sweet
as
the
malt
is
cut
by
a
mild
dry
bitterness
a
great
german
festbier
if
the
sold
this
by
the
case
at
costco
like
they
do
sam
adams
id
definitely
stock
up
easy
to
drink
with
a
complete
taste
overall
an
easy
drinking
octoberfest
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
style
but
clean
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
fullbodied
as
the
label
boasts
but
its
got
a
hefty
rich
medium
body
i
prefer
to
the
alternative
theres
a
gentle
crispness
all
the
way
as
well
as
being
smooth
and
creamy
o
a
very
enjoyable
märzen
very
tasty
and
wellbalanced
definitely
looking
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
i
agree
with
those
who
say
that
this
brew
sets
the
bar
for
oktoberfest
märzens
although
i
personally
prefer
samuel
adams
octoberfest
and
victorys
festbier
taste
very
creamy
light
caramel
notes
tealike
a
great
all
around
lager
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
even
though
its
not
a
true
munich
brewed
oktoberfestbier
its
one
of
my
favorites
o
great
version
of
the
style
great
beer
overall
and
highly
drinkable
o
classic
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
representation
of
an
oktoberfest
this
is
a
must
try
easy
drinking
with
great
flavor
one
of
the
beers
i
must
drink
from
a
mug
good
stuff
flavor
starts
off
with
some
nice
candylike
caramel
malt
notes
nice
notes
of
fresh
bready
grain
notes
there
is
some
nice
herbal
and
flowery
hop
notes
mixed
in
there
that
give
the
brew
a
slight
spice
as
well
malty
notes
are
delicious
andn
the
hops
give
a
good
balance
yummy
marzen
o
good
drinkable
but
ill
probably
stick
with
more
local
examples
of
the
style
to
take
advantage
of
freshness
overall
a
really
great
oktoberfest
maybe
a
little
on
the
thinner
side
but
really
a
great
late
summerearly
fall
brew
on
a
sunny
afternoon
o
nice
festbier
not
anything
offensive
but
nothing
really
punches
you
in
the
face
the
finish
dryness
is
kinda
surprising
and
welcome
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
would
seek
it
out
in
september
for
fest
bier
choice
ayinger
oktoberfest
is
probably
the
best
bottled
example
of
an
oktoberfest
youll
find
in
the
states
the
malts
are
very
complex
offering
many
facets
of
the
drink
while
still
being
extremely
drinkable
due
to
a
spot
on
carbonation
level
and
lighter
body
o
enjoyable
but
far
from
the
best
in
the
ayinger
catalog
i
couldnt
ask
for
anything
more
oktober
festmarzen
pours
a
golden
color
with
very
little
head
there
is
a
harsh
malty
and
sour
aroma
the
taste
is
the
same
rather
harsh
malty
and
almost
a
bit
sour
the
body
and
flavors
are
light
but
that
is
a
good
thing
overall
its
a
below
average
marzen
overall
a
quite
nice
and
tasty
oktoberfest
with
a
great
blend
of
sweet
malty
roast
and
some
spice
a
job
well
done
not
as
sweet
as
expected
with
great
malt
complexity
very
clean
and
drinkable
the
mineral
notes
are
a
bit
offputting
o
a
very
nice
malt
forward
beer
with
lots
of
malt
complexity
wonderfully
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
it
does
drink
a
little
higher
than
5
8
abv
though
o
easily
this
is
a
top
three
oktoberfest
marzen
lager
this
beer
comes
fairly
close
to
living
up
to
the
hype
rarest
of
the
style
in
my
area
but
worth
hunting
down
every
year
o
a
very
good
beer
full
flavored
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
the
best
example
of
this
style
i
have
ever
had
o
on
the
whole
this
beer
isnt
especially
good
just
decent
overalllone
of
the
better
oktoberfests
i
have
had
great
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
allinall
i
was
disapointed
i
love
the
hefe
from
this
brewery
im
finding
that
oktoberfest
beers
are
hit
and
miss
for
me
prosiit
fill
up
the
stein
and
drink
deep
on
this
delicious
malty
marzen
makes
you
want
to
drink
many
steins
of
this
delicious
brew
tastes
great
and
you
want
more
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
very
nice
more
of
a
drier
strong
pale
lagerhelles
bockdortmunder
composition
as
compared
to
some
of
the
more
commercial
oktoberfest
examples
which
tend
to
be
much
sweeter
in
my
opinion
the
most
wellbalanced
marzen
on
the
shelf
take
note
america
this
is
how
you
do
it
the
closest
american
version
in
terms
of
overall
quality
is
either
great
lakes
okt
or
mektoberfest
but
personally
i
believe
this
to
be
the
worldwide
standard
oi
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
robust
since
its
a
german
brewed
oktoberfest
but
it
is
still
a
delicious
brew
one
ill
definitely
buy
again
overall
really
good
oktoberfest
lots
of
flavor
while
maintaining
an
insanely
high
level
of
drinkability
definitely
pick
up
a
few
of
these
not
exactly
a
sessionable
beer
and
i
wish
there
were
more
in
this
style
but
here
it
its
and
its
a
good
one
o
3
75
good
beer
great
for
the
fall
id
love
to
drink
this
at
a
hay
ride
or
while
raking
leaves
but
i
live
in
arizona
it
has
a
light
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
an
unusual
marzen
and
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
perfectly
balanced
the
malt
drives
the
beer
and
the
hops
just
dont
offer
much
more
than
black
tea
flavor
its
worth
trying
but
is
overrated
in
my
opinion
i
buy
one
of
these
every
year
and
it
always
hits
the
spot
a
great
example
of
the
oktoberfest
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
industrystandard
when
it
comes
to
oktoberfest
poors
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
3
inch
had
that
lasts
for
about
5
to
10
minutes
the
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
extends
throughout
the
drink
itself
a
little
lighter
orange
amber
color
than
other
oktoberfest
but
seems
to
have
a
little
more
pronounced
mouth
feel
like
all
other
oktoberfests
you
really
start
to
enjoy
the
depth
and
quality
of
the
malt
as
it
approaches
50
this
beer
and
its
brothers
and
sister
in
the
style
coupled
with
nfl
football
is
what
makes
the
fall
season
exceedingly
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
the
best
example
of
the
style
since
the
yeast
and
the
sweetness
seemed
a
little
too
dominant
for
this
beer
and
i
think
thats
pretty
out
of
place
for
this
style
this
beer
has
ok
drinkability
its
fairly
smooth
but
the
flavors
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
one
would
be
enough
for
me
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
multiples
of
since
i
think
the
yeast
and
sweetness
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
it
looked
good
and
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
yeast
and
the
sweetness
they
seemed
to
dominate
this
beer
and
over
power
the
classic
marzen
flavors
that
are
suppose
to
shine
through
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
theres
many
other
german
marzens
that
i
prefer
more
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
it
didnt
impress
me
since
it
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
traditional
german
marzen
it
just
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
so
far
its
my
least
favorite
german
made
marzen
overall
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
and
beers
in
my
general
opinion
this
is
a
superb
specimen
bready
yeasty
dangerously
drinkable
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
in
quantity
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
for
years
to
come
500ml
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
wit
a
med
to
large
lasting
fluffy
white
aroma
and
taste
of
sweet
toasted
barley
and
grains
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
some
light
fruity
notes
a
medium
bodied
crisp

refreshing
on
the
palate
with
good
carbonation
the
finish

fruity

some

notes
this
is
an
all
nicely
balanced
crisp
and
refreshing
oktoberfest
very
nice
o
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
good
flavor
just
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
marzen
could
also
be
a
bit
past
its
expiration
too
certainly
a
quality
brew
for
the
1
99
i
paid
wont
rush
out
to
grab
this
again
but
its
certainly
a
beer
i
wont
mind
sampling
again
im
having
a
bottle
of
ayinger
oktoberfest
out
of
season
for
the
second
time
not
a
problem
it
tastes
just
fine
even
in
june
this
orangegold
brew
looks
great
and
has
good
head
smells
apple
sweet
from
what
ive
been
reading
in
other
reviews
the
yeast
is
part
of
what
lends
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
great
malty
texture
the
hops
lend
a
mild
spiciness
but
the
yeast
again
gives
it
some
fruit
exceedingly
pleasant
to
drink
a
great
member
of
the
family
of
bavarian
lagers
its
the
best
out
there
in
my
not
so
humble
opinion
for
some
reason
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
bolder
in
flavor
and
heavier
in
mouthfeel
that
being
said
everything
was
correct
to
style
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
pretty
solid
oktoberfest
would
drink
another
i
tried
this
one
because
it
claims
to
be
somewhat
of
an
official
oktoberfest
beer
and
i
would
love
to
go
to
oktoberfest
one
day
it
certainly
did
not
disappoint
for
an
oktoberfest
lager
it
was
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
it
beat
90
of
the
lagers
that
i
have
had
to
date
and
the
sweetness
actually
made
it
a
little
better
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
in
the
game
absolutely
beautifully
crafted
great
amber
color
caramelized
malt
note
and
subtle
sweetness
this
one
absolutely
nails
it
buy
one
to
know
what
they
should
all
be
judged
by
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
pours
a
burnt
yellow
colour
the
nose
on
this
is
just
amazingso
complex
and
inviting
its
nutty
fruity
and
brimming
with
so
many
great
malt
notes
tastewise
its
equally
complex
its
slightly
sweet
but
has
a
nice
robustness
with
a
delicious
spicy
finish
the
best
of
this
style
weve
had
its
perfect
for
hearty
holiday
meals
overall
typical
ayinger
commercial
but
very
nice
tasting
and
average
5
5

abv
except
for
the
celebrator
of
course
great

beers
normally
straight
80s
in
my
opinion
o
not
bad
at
all
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
decent
flavor
profile
but
as
with
most
ayinger
brews
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
there
are
a
handful
of
oktoberfest
brews
id
opt
for
over
this
one
but
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
options
are
limited
overall
a
decent
oktoberfestbier
there
are
others
that
i
like
better
but
this
one
certainly
will
get
purchased
again
in
the
future

feel
is
middle
of

but
more
active
on
the
carbonation
end
which
was
nice
overall
a
pretty
impressive
balanced
marzen
liked
the
blend
of
spice
malts
and
subtle
hops
a
very
solid
effort
and
pretty
true
to
the
form
from
the
german
end
nothing
outstanding
but
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
fall
evening
will
be
hitting
another
soon
an
excellent
märzen
o
easy
to
drink
sessionable
and
enjoyable
pairs
nicely
with
a
burger
and
fries
definitely
one
of
the
better
german
offerings
in
the
style
that
is
easy
to
find
in
the
us
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
body
moderate
to
full
carbonation
slightly
chewy
but
really
very
refreshing
and
smooth
exceptional
marzen
definitely
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
thus
far
ive
been
coming
back
to
it
all
season
and
finally
decided
to
review
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
head
with
some
lacing
color
is
golden
amber
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
the
malty
grains
and
floral
hops
but
the
real
reason
we
drink
is
the
taste
this
is
the
bench
mark
of
all
oktoberfest
beers
fresh
clean
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
leaving
it
slightly
sweet
there
is
a
light
hop
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
hard
to
have
just
one
great
with
a
soft
pretzel
or
bratwurst
with
kraut
overall
4
5
as
stated
before
i
can
only
compare
ayingers
oktoberfest
to
paulaners
where
paulaners
keeps
their
pricepoint
down
and
the
taste
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
ayinger
seems
to
capture
the
essence
of
oktoberfest
its
my
favorite
but
im
not
sure
i
can
afford
more
than
two
or
three
500ml
bottles
a
season
d
very
drinkable
goes
great
with
food
or
without
quite
thirst
quenching
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
initial
appearance
including
a
nice
head
nose
of
sweet
and
nutty
components
light
in
body
but
sweet
and
malty
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
a
well
done
marzen
well
balanced
with
a
pleasant
array
of
flavors
will
still
maintaining
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
quality
o
after
exploring
many
oktoberfest
beers
this
year
i
can
say
this
is
one
of
the
top
i
have
tried
the
body
is
not
overly
thick
compared
to
the
aroma
but
it
packs
great
flavors
that
are
nice
and
filling
this
is
oktoberfest
that
i
will
have
every
year
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
the
price
is
unbeatable
i
think
i
paid
around
3
for
this
one
well
worth
it
a
very
satisfying
malty
slightly
citrusy
beer
as
so
many
german
beers
are
the
look
head
and
color
is
superb
so
easy
to
drink
so
refreshing
and
always
consistent
this
beer
could
be
enjoyed
in
the
words
of
usain
bolt
all
day
every
day
good
ol
trusty
oktoberfest
its
a
classic
im
a
fan
4
0
b
not
great
perhaps
there
is
something
here
for
others
but
i
poured
most
of
mine
wont
be
buying
anymore
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
from
germany
i
really
enjoyed
it
even
though
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
more
flavorful
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
o
sadly
i
cannot
get
behind
this
one
i
have
yet
to
find
a
beer
from
ayinger
that
i
would
not
have
again
and
this
makes
the
first
average
across
the
board
lacking
that
certain
something
special
the
other
beers
contain
overall
its
a
good
oktoberfest
but
i
am
comparing
it
to
all
other
german
oktoberfests
and
its
just
not
my
favorite
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
finger
width
head
some
lacing
and
chunky
remainder
smell
is
a
little
biscuity
with
some
caramel
taste
is
again
biscuity
with
slight
apple
undertones
lots
of
bubbles
feel
quite
nice
but
its
got
a
fuller
body
than
i
like
with
my
lagers
overall
i
think
its
a
really
solid
beer
a
noteworthy
brew
in
the
marzen
style
i
think
more
on
the
drink
of
bunch
of
side
than
contemplate
the
flavors
side
still
good
just
think
others
have
surpassed
it
oayinger
does
many
things
well
and
unique
to
their
brewery
disappointingly
so
their
oktoberfest
is
not
one
of
them
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
that
can
be
drunk
in
excess
and
is
i
want
to
combine
the
taste
of
this
with
the
mouthfeel
of
paulaners
marzen
it
vould
be
the
greatest
beer
in
all
ze
vorld
this
is
a
wonderful
for
the
price
just
under
3
bucks
for
a
500ml
bottle
it
has
a
great
nose
on
it
perfect
for
the
seasonal
change
now
occuring
lots
of
german
malts
caramunich
and
pale
flavors
but
it
must
be
more
complex
than
that
there
is
also
the
classic
marzen
yeast
aroma
that
is
pungent
and
strong
the
flavor
is
malt
driven
but
in
reasonable
balance
for
the
style
there
is
some
bittering
hops
throughout
and
a
very
organic
feel
to
this
one
wheat
malt
profile
in
the
flavor
although
i
doubt
its
presence
the
finish
is
cleaner
than
expected
as
well
and
the
mouthfeel
overall
is
pleasing
great
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
it
is
enough
to
take
the
cold
edge
out
of
a
fall
evening
ill
buy
this
again
this
season
especially
for
the
price
this
is
a
very
authentic
product
true
to
style
bold
and
flavorful
very
drinkable
well
done
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
beer
sets
the
standard
in
the
märzen
style
do
try
others
but
accept
no
substitutes
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
marzens
out
there
and
a
staple
for
the
style
very
enjoyable
and
it
shows
that
a
marzen
can
be
both
clean
and
complex
this
was
good
i
liked
how
it
kept
the
focus
here
on
those
crisp
hops
yet
still
left
room
for
plenty
of
flavor
from
those
malts
as
well
and
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
was
top
notch
i
could
knock
back
bottles
of
this
all
during
the
ofest
season
o
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
this
marzen
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
can
see
why
germans
and
tourists
alike
pound
back
liters
of
this
stuff
this
time
of
year
light
and
sweet
and
delicious
i
mean
just
what
you
want
in
an
oktoberfest
easy
to
drink
amazingly
flavorful
and
not
too
bitter
so
you
can
knock
em
back
as
it
was
intended
great
beer
that
is
just
fun
to
have
medium
bodied
and
prickly
in
texture
this
ones
a
winner
one
of
the
better
okts
on
the
market
puts
most
any
stater
to
shame
not
a
beer
to
remember
i
have
had
better
marzens
an
excellent
and
wellexecuted
fest
beer
that
represents
what
these
things
are
supposed
to
taste
like
no
watereddown
malt
flavors
and
no
excessive
hops
just
bread
in
a
bottle
a
classic
beer
that
will
accompany
any
dish
from
chicken
or
burgers
to
pizza
or
pasta
i
think
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
oa
nice
ofest
lager
that
suffers
from
a
strange
flavor
in
the
finish
maybe
my
batch
was
a
bit
oldoxidized
it
compares
well
against
its
competition
but
is
not
going
to
set
the
world
afire
if
you
want
a
drinkable
brew
this
fall
for
a
mild
not
hotnot
cool
afternoon
here
you
go
overall
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
my
one
complaint
is
that
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
a
little
too
subdued
that
aside
the
drinkability
is
incredible
and
i
could
easily
put
back
lots
of
this
in
a
sitting
crystal
clear
deep
yellow
excellent
lacing
big
sweet
cereal
malt
notes
insanely
crisp
finish
great
oktoberfest
o
this
is
good
stuff
i
could
easily
knock
these
back
all
night
to
celebrate
the
season
of
the
okto
brews
ive
had
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
if
not
the
best
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
it
does
however
have
some
qualities
that
i
dont
care
fore
musty
metallic
warm
on
its
face
its
a
solid
oktoberfest
but
the
offputting
subtleties
ruin
it
for
me
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
d
superbly
drinkable
smells
and
tastes
like
a
toasted
whole
wheat
bagel
with
medium
levels
of
pecan
hazelnuts
and
light
fruity
apple
esters
floating
around
in
the
background
earthy
and
herbal
hopping
garnishes
appear
along
with
a
touch
of
chamomile
tea
as
the
glass
warms
up
very
clean
flavor
profile
overall
a
nice
octoberfest
quite
drinkable
i
found
this
one
in
a
16oz
single
but
id
certainly
buy
a
sixer
of
it
overall
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
oktoberfest
but
you
could
also
do
a
lot
better
the
germans
make
this
type
of
beer
to
appeal
to
the
american
market
ive
found
german
amber
fest
beers
to
be
lacking
they
truly
shine
with
their
blond
fest
biers
see
hofbrau
and
traunstein
500ml
bottle
been
trying
to
move
through
some
german
beers
lately
so
i
can
educate
myself
nice
orangeamber
color
good
foamy
head
smells
like
lager
eh
flavor
is
just
a
real
lager
grain
type
of
event
shit
was
good
but
nothing
stellar
i
could
probably
knock
back
a
couple
liter
of
this
and
pass
out
on
a
picnic
table
nein
o
this
is
a
really
good
oktoberfest
its
full
of
excellent
german
malt
flavors
and
aromas
and
has
the
perfect
abv
for
a
fest
beer
not
so
little
that
you
have
to
be
drinking
all
day
to
feel
anything
but
not
so
little
that
youre
one
and
done
i
wish
the
head
retention
was
a
little
better
and
there
was
a
bit
less
carbonation
for
the
sake
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
great
beer
im
so
glad
its
getting
to
be
fall
even
if
i
do
live
in
charleston
and
its
still
90
degrees
im
gonna
drink
some
fall
beers
dammit
overall
a
tasty
oktoberfest
style
brew
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
the
best
oktoberfest
ever
othis
is
an
amazing
oktoberfest
the
tastes
are
awesome
yet
subtle
enough
that
i
could
drink
liters
of
this
all
night
this
was
really
nice
oktoberfest
nice
balanced
flavor
and
refreshing
pours
a
dark
super
clear
and
lustrous
bronzy
whiskeyish
yellow
nose
is
hidden
some
tones
of
alcohol
and
an
oddly
new
car
like
vibe
taste
is
light
toasted
grain
and
light
malt
and
some
light
sweetness
mid
to
low
on
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
wet
refreshing
carbonation
is
high
and
scrubbing
with
a
creamy
but
not
oocky
finish
really
liked
this
too
my
first
marzen
and
came
with
a
very
spiffy
bottle
cap
that
will
look
terrific
with
our
other
frigmag
caps
would
have
again
this
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
crisp
carbonation
delicious
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
an
above
average
brew
some
good
grassygrainy
flavours
here
that
suit
the
falloktoberfest
season
well
wow
very
good
rich
mouthfeel
yet
creamy
and
smooth
toasted
grain
up
front
followed
by
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
refreshing
spicy
hop
bite
bit
of
detectable
tin
throughout
and
waters
down
a
bit
on
the
finish
otherwise
though
an
amazing
oktoberfest
beer
review
from

notes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
orange
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
wheat
very
mild
sweet
caramel
malt
and
wheat
flavor
much
like
the
aroma
but
surprisingly
subdued
pleasant
but
light
flavored
caramel
malt
improved
with
warming
nothing
outstanding
but
nice
light
refreshing
octoberfest
beer
o
brewed
perfectly
for
what
its
meant
for
sheer
drinkability
ayingers
oktober
festmärzen
is
a
worldclass
beer
thats
incredibly
well
done
and
as
close
to
the
epitome
of
an
oktoberfest
as
possible
a
maltlovers
dream
this
is
devoid
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
letting
the
deep
maltiness
really
shine
overall
possibly
the
best
oktoberfest
in
existence
lovely
a
original
review
on
09142010
o
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
but
maybe
not
the
best
for
a
hop
head
since
there
are
almost
no
hops
still
definitely
worth
trying
and
its
one
ill
probably
have
again
i
had
several
of
these
on
tap
during
octoberfest
event
out
of
10
or
so
octoberfest
brews
this
one
stood
above
the
appearance
was
darker
brown
but
clear
with
a
beautiful
head
smell
was
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
bread
very
pleasant
taste
was
sweet
and
roasted
not
much
hops
but
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
you
can
drink
several
to
many
at
a
time
if
you
are
in
the
mood
and
at
an
octoberfest
event
you
should
be
in
the
mood
fresh
on
tap
was
memorable
and
look
forward
to
it
every
fall
the
okatoberfest
märzen
with
its
beautiful
brown
color
and
malt
aroma
is
one
of
my
favorite
german
style
beers
there
is
little
head
and
little
head
retention
but
the
head
is
certainly
thicker
than
that
of
a
pilsner
or
lager
there
is
perhaps
a
hint
of
a
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
more
malt
sweetness
than
it
is
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
balanced
with
a
leaning
toward
sweet
the
mouth
feel
consists
of
little
alcohol
heat
and
little
carbonation
the
finish
is
quite
smooth
due
to
the
balance
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
mo
quaffable
more
complex
than
a
regular
pale
lager
or
even
oktoberfest
beers
made
here
a
classic
500

on
the

for
a

great

with
absolutely
no
cloying

medium

and
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
and
smooth

alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
noticed
at
all
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
as
expected
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
yet
great
balance
and
great
malt
flavor
o
this
is
the
definitive
marzenoktoberfest
style
beer
tasty
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
notes
a
delicious
and
well
balanced
beer
easily
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
finally
found
this
one
still
looking
for
a
great
octoberfest
beer
pours
a
wonderfully
clear
pale
amber
with
a
huge
and
persistent
head
smell
is
light
floral
taste
is
huge
malt
for
such
a
light
beer
herbal
and
grasy
with
some
vanilla
creamy
almost
fantastic
i
think
the
heavy
malt
may
put
some
off
it
i
love
it
o
thought
is
was
a
good
ocktoberfest
great
seasonal
beer
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
cheers
todd
this
is
an
awesome
marzen
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
incredible
depth
for
a
such
a
drinkable
beer
extremely
well
crafted
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
light
copper
color
thats
crystal
clear
a
large
white
foamy
head
sits
on
top
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
minimal
random
lacing
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malts
tastes
like
an
oktoberfest
should
sweet
caramel
overtone
roasted
malts
a
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
carbonated
overall
a
nice
marzen
ill
try
this
next
year
to
see
if
it
changes
like
some
of
the
american
oktoberfests
do
nice
body
that
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
tingle
from
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
heavy
orange
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
rocky
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
earthy
toasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
sweet
biscuit
smooth
delicate
feel
with
lazy
rich
tight
carbonation
toasted
and
bready
malt
flavors
throughout
tangy
carbonation
through
the
middle
introduces
light
herbal
hop
flavors
finished
crisply
with
a
lingering
toasted
malt
character
o
a
great
example
of
what
beer
should
be
big
on
flavour
and
easy
drinking
brings
me
back
to
munich
prost
overall
rich
bready
beer
that
can
stand
on
its
own
even
though
it
has
a
lighter
body
very
satisfying
light
almost
watery
beer
but
doesnt
bothers
you
palate
you
dont
get
used
to
it
excellent
beer
truly
an
exceptional
oktober
marzen
bier
this
is
a
pretty
good
representative
for
oktoberfest
beers
bodylight
to
medium
weight
heavy
crisp
effervescence
that
has
nice
lasting
qualities
kind
of
frothy
and
a
little
bit
creamy
a
hint
of
dry
in
the
finish
flavor
intensity
matches
the
body
sweet
sour
and
bitter
are
all
balanced
pretty
well
just
nothing
too
complex
love
it
great
oktoberfest
style
also
easy
to
drink
while
still
being
a
great
example
overall
an
oktoberfest
that
is
super
light
in
body
and
flavor
although
a
tasty
brew
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
of
both
o
very
nice
oktoberfest
beer
drinkable
4
for
a
500ml
bottle
overall
its
well
put
together
overall
not
a
bad
brew
has
some
good
flavor
profile
to
it
could
be
a
fun
session
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
whats
so
great
about
this
marzen
its
nearly
perfect
in
what
we
should
expect
from
the
classic
style
of
course
its
not
perfect
its
just
amazingly
available
high
quality
and
traditional
o
solid
beer
like
it
quite
a
bit
in
a
style
that
doesnt
often
do
it
for
me
all
that
said
this
one
is
very
drinkable
it
is
going
to
be
a
malt
heads
go
to
beer
in
many
cases
but
i
dont
see
why
this
is
a
fall
seasonal
nor
am
i
impressed
just
another
ok
beer
thats
lost
among
the
crowd
for
an
oktoberfest
it
is
definitely
in
a
league
of
its
own
i
havent
had
an
american
one
quite
like
this
at
all
its
does
have
that
same
european
beer
taste
for
lack
of
a
better
term
but
this
one
takes
it
up
a
notch
with
the
hops
and
the
way
the
balance
the
beer
as
a
whole
you
can
tell
in
the
smell
theres
something
different
about
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
definitely
the
best
ive
had
this
year
a
very
good
oktoberfest
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
its
a
very
flavorful
example
of
the
style
im
a
real
fan
of
this
oktoberfest
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
well
balanced
and
brings
everything
that
an
oktoberfest
beer
should
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
pint
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
matl
wheat
grain
biscuit
subtle
fruit
floral
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
my
impression
of
this
one
was
the
aroma
was
lacking
but
the
flavor
had
potential
there
were
a
lot
of
flavors
i
had
never
picked
up
on
before
going
on
in
this
one
which
was
a
nice
changeup
from
the
normal
brews
from
this
style
the
aroma
was
just
plain
and
simply
lacking
in
complexity
worth
trying
for
a
fan
of
the
style
but
that
is
about
it
gotta
get
a
bunch
more
before
the
seasons
over
cant
beat
the
german
beer
price
either
taste
is
pretty
much
in
the
lagerpilsner
realm
light
and
easy
drinking
just
a
touch
more
in
the
mouthfeel
again
theres
a
little
malt
and
maybe
a
whisper
of
the
cocoa
butter
i
sometimes
pickup
from
marzens
but
honestly
in
a
blind
taste
testing
id
probably
rank
this
higher
than
a
bmc
but
not
by
much
and
i
guess
i
expected
so
much
more
poured
this
marzen
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
orangish
amber
color
it
produced
a
very
nice
thick
white
head
and
had
excellent
retention
the
aroma
of
this
oktoberfest
was
full
of
caramel
fresh
sourdough
and
slightly
sweet
the
ale
is
medium
in
body
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
taste
had
a
nice
bready
backbone
toasted
malt
there
is
a
nice
sweet
caramel
toffee
flavor
that
is
balanced
nicely
by
earthy
hops
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
that
i
have
tried
this
will
be
the
one
that
i
measure
all
others
against
excellent
beer
from
an
excellent
german
brewery
prost
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
hops
sweet
malt
and
mild
spiciness
grassy
earthy
hops
up
front
which
are
floral
and
only
slightly
drybitter
followed
by
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
over
a
prominent
malt
backbone
lots
of
sweet
caramel
with
hints
of
pumpkin
toast
nut
and
biscuit
really
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
nice
example
of
the
style
o
good
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
with
a
crisp
finish
however
i
found
this
one
to
be
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
able
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
more
than
one
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
under
this
brews
residual
sweetness
o
marzen
on
juice
looks
like
a
marzen
and
drinks
like
a
bock
not
as
easy
drinking
as
hb
or
spaten
or
any
domestic
marzen
but
certainly
much
more
complex
huge
flavor
profile
for
style
dont
know
if
my
oktoberfest
would
last
all
day
if
i
was
drinking
this
alone
o
just
a
world
class
marzen
my
favorite
to
date
excellent
brew
overall
it
is
a
good
oktoberfest
when
you
get
down
to
drinking
there
was
some
apprehension
when
it
was
first
brought
to
the
table
but
it
drinks
well
a
nice
herbal
mix
that
really
works
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
respectable
beer
if
there
are
any
bottles
of
this
left
when
im
next
at
tjs
im
going
to
pick
them
up
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
that
i
have
had
and
this
isnt
a
style
i
normally
get
hard
over
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
marzen
not
the
most
flavorful
one
but
it
does
what
it
does
very
well
and
is
an
easy
drink
granted
these
beers
have
no
obvious
date
on
the
bottles
so
you
could
pick
up
an
old
one
and
not
be
any
the
wiser
until
you
drink
it
solution
buy
from
a
store
with
high
turnover
o
i
havent
had
too
many
marzens
that
i
like
but
i
really
dig
this
one
the
flavors
are
lot
more
complex
and
distinguishable
throughout
they
seem
more
natural
than
some
of
the
american
versions
ive
tasted
very
nice
very
enjoyable
spot
on
must
be
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
beers
i
have
had
overall
very
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
octoberfest
beers
on
the
market
give
it
a
shot
o
this
is
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
lager
that
represents
the
märzen
style
well
simple
and
traditional
try
this
one
if
you
really
want
to
know
what
a
german
oktoberfest
beer
is
supposed
to
be
this
beer
also
features
the
coolest
crown
ive
ever
seen
overall
it
is
an
easygoing
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
perfect
for
a
fall
day
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
honeygolden
yellow
coloring
that
pours
with
a
ton
of
white
foamy
frothy
head
the
head
initially
stacks
up
fast
while
you
pour
but
it
settles
into
a
two
inch
layer
with
great
endurance
the
beers
nose
is
heavy
with
toasted
grains
and
rich
malt
sweetness
and
some
light
spicing
throughout
flavors
have
a
rich
honey
and
sugary
sweet
malt
profile
with
light
toasted
cereal
flavors
in
the
background
the
flavors
are
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
smooth
and
round
body
great
cling
slong
the
glass
while
you
drink
the
aftertaste
is
light
but
a
slight
sweetness
does
linger
behind
this
is
a
very
clean
brew
the
finish
is
quick
and
slick
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
while
avoiding
the
overpowering
and
cloying
sweetness
that
some
marzens
carry
impressive
decent
stuff
not
mindblowing
picked
it
up
for
only
1
99
at
that
price
id
check
it
out
again
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
nutty
and
toffee
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
grass
thrown
in
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
is
full
of
toffee
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
there
are
some
nice
floral
hop
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
which
really
add
to
the
flavor
profile
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
best
germanbrewed
märzens
out
there
tasty
beers
always
a
good
thing
and
this
is
no
exception
nice
beer
for
this
chilly
fall
evening
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
in
my
limited
experience
with
marzensand
german
lagers
in
generalthis
stands
out
as
one
of
my
favorites
an
excellent
malty
aroma
was
present
during
the
pour
and
lingered
thoughout
the
pint
decent
fizz
but
not
overpowering
sweet
malt
is
the
main
flavor
but
with
a
hint
of
hops
to
make
it
a
wonderfully
smooth
beer
a
great
beer
its
a
shame
i
only
had
one
to
try
prost
verdict
pretty
delicious
oktoberfest
beer
its
a
bit
bolder
and
more
intricate
than
most
lagers
that
goes
down
easily
and
bridges
the
gap
well
between
summer
and
fall
overall
this
one
gets
better
with
every
sip
may
be
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
out
there
i
dont
actually
know
what
it
looked
like
because
i
had
it
poured
in
a
cinema
that
was
very
dark
no
head
though
i
know
that
it
smelled
distinctly
of
apple
juice
not
like
green
apples
just
regular
sweet
apple
juice
the
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
as
well
but
also
biscuity
it
had
very
much
a
taste
of
both
bread
and
still
some
of
that
apple
juice
that
dominated
the
smell
it
sounds
like
a
terrible
combination
but
actually
it
was
fairly
appealing
to
me
biscuity
and
sweet
delicious
overall
a
totally
legit
session
oktoberfest
i
really
dont
like
oktoberfestmarzens
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
is
probably
the
only
one
that
ive
had
so
far
that
i
will
drink
again
when
you
drink
a
brew
like
this
one
you
understand
why
there
is
an
entire
tradition
that
surrounds
the
marzen
style
i
could
drink
this
one
for
days
if
you
rate
to
style
rating
should
be
higher
im
grading
this
one
overall
because
the
best
marzen
ive
had
fails
in
comparison
to
the
best
dipa
or
wee
heavy
ive
had
a
firstclass
festive
maltforward
brew
with
a
lingering
sweet
taste
cant
go
wrong
here
this
one
nailed
the
mark
obviously
a
classic
but
nice
to
try
among
many
other
recent
oktoberfests
definitely
the
standout
if
you
want
to
experience
the
style
this
is
where
to
go
i
love
the
fall
o
top
notch
oktoberfest
right
here
a
great
session
beer
for
the
fall
i
paired
it
with
cheddar
cheese
crackers
and
playoff
baseball
perfect
do
in
a
style
that
is
prepared
to
be
very
drinkable
this
one
is
no
exception
4
0
o
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
o
maybe
marzens
just
arent
my
cup
i
know
ayinger
makes
some
world
class
stuff
but
this
fell
pretty
flat
compared
to
some
of
their
other
offerings
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
bottle
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
clear
light
copper
color
aith
a
slight
bone
white
head
sweet
bready
nose
with
some
caramel
medium
mouthfee
sweet
start
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
biscuity
honey
medium
mouthfeel
ever
so
slight
bitterness
built
in
pretty
nice
some
lace
a
really
good
marzen
but
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
for
me
o
really
nice
ofest
and
more
than
worthy
in
a
very
competitive
style
o
i
like
it
one
of
the
better
marzens
ive
had
balanced
flavor
not
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
great
example
of
the
style
really
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
ill
be
honest
the
style
i
dislike
the
most
is
any
kind
of
lager
so
dont
mind
a
somewhat
poor
review
if
you
enjoy
lagers
you
will
probably
love
this
beer
i
dont
regret
trying
this
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
ayinger
makes
some
great
brews
and
if
you
like
them
buy
if
you
can
find
it
o
i
gave
this
4s
across
the
board
and
a
4
5
overall
this
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
one
aspect
but
is
a
very
good
widely
available
german
brewed
oktoberfest
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
ive
had
it
also
happens
to
have
one
of
the
cooler
caps
around
for
those
of
us
who
are
into
that
thanks
to
titosupertramp
for
nabbing
two
of
these
for
me
t
lots
of
bready
malts
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
some
faint
hop
resin
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
this
style
pretty
good
marzen
style
probably
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
but
i
have
many
more
to
try
this
fall
nice
bready
smell
not
overwhelming
the
color
pretty
much
sets
the
scene
for
the
fall
time
slightly
creamy
and
taste
is
right
on
for
the
style
very
slight
spice
towards
the
end
but
nothing
to
powering
it
is
very
light
spice
also
slightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
caramel
throughout
overall
very
good
and
will
pick
up
again
pours
an
orangish
clear
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
there
is
a
two
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
and
leaves
some
rings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
breadiness
and
caramel
malts
there
is
a
hint
of
green
fruits
at
the
end
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
bulk
being
biscuits
and
bread
there
is
also
a
roastiness
to
it
at
the
backend
there
is
a
sweet
green
fruit
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinks
you
will
ever
have
overall
a
very
good
version
of
a
marzen
nice
combination
of
malts
and
yeast
the
only
thing
that
i
wish
is
that
i
could
find
more
oktoberfest
beers
like
this
that
are
more
affordable
another
solid
beer
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
very
tasty
marzen
that
gets
my
award
for
the
most
drinkable
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
not
as
rich
or
exciting
as
some
others
especially
those
brewed
in
america
but
it
goes
down
so
easy
i
could
surely
tip
back
two
or
three
liters
of
this
at
an
oktoberfest
celebration
this
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
this
had
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
to
it
this
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
german
oktoberfest
lagers
ive
tried
this
year
it
had
a
nice
richness
of
flavor
and
good
balance
of
alcohol
so
far
its
tops
of
the
german
marzen
list
for
me
better
hopped
than
most
marzens
this
still
has
a
wonderfully
round
body
with
a
solid
dry
caramel
malt
flavor
rich
body
that
belies
the
lager
monicker
the
swallow
is
mildly
bitter
but
the
aftertaste
lasts
well
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
properties
the
aromas
are
more
subdued
than
those
of
comparable
quality
oktoberfests
such
as
spaten
but
every
bit
as
complex
and
seductive
i
smell
a
lot
of
toastiness
and
earthiness
at
first
and
then
pick
up
delicious
notes
of
spicy
apple
sauce
and
sliced
peaches
the
taste
is
very
toasty
and
bready
up
front
with
lots
of
earthiness
and
pie
crust
on
the
midpalate
with
hints
of
autumn
spices
and
fruits
adding
yet
another
layer
on
the
finish
one
of
of
my
favorite
germanmade
oktoberfests
notes
exceptional
beer
o
this
one
is
great
i
think
what
make
this
beer
so
good
is
the
combo
of
subtle
hops
fruityflavor
pinespice
carbonation
and
last
but
not
least
alcohol
level
very
refreshing
and
will
get
again
and
goin
to
look
for
a
tap
asap
clear
medium
body
multiple
streams
of
quickly
rising
carbonation
medium
pour
resulted
in
a
mere
finger
and
a
half
my
bad
pure
white
head
over
deep
gold
body
good
sized
layer
of
head
retained
not
much
lacing
caramel
and
vienna
notes
dominate
the
nose
really
clean
taste
features
the
caramel
notes
up
front
with
very
little
hops
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
medium
effervescence
pretty
dry
finish
while
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
imho
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
worlds
best
oktoberfests
recommended
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
ayinger
oktober
festmärzen
and
i
guess
the
second
time
was
a
charm
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
was
underwhelmed
but
i
thought
ayinger
deserved
another
chance
considering
i
loved
the
other
offerings
i
have
had
from
them
and
this
time
they
delivered
a
very
solid
crisp
drinkable
oktoberfest
wunderbar
one
day
i
will
travel
to
the
motherland
to
taste
all
the
wonderful
brews
and
only
then
will
i
know
how
this
sizes
up
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
smell
is
good
and
malty
some
bread
and
toffee
along
with
a
little
floral
hops
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
with
good
carbinonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
also
some
rich
maltiness
bread
and
toffee
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hop
bite
but
not
much
overall
a
pretty
tasty
oktoberfest
beer
o
based
on
other
reviews
id
say
i
didnt
get
a
fresh
bottle
thanks
for
thinking
of
me
lub
but
this
is
why
i
dont
buy
freshness
critical
beer
from
brewers
who
dont
date
their
products
damn
this
bottle
has
to
have
the
loveliest
cap
of
all
time
regardless
it
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
caramel
light
grass
light
rye
bread
cabbage
light
mandarin
orange
and
a
decent
amount
of
straight
bready
yeast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
caramel
is
slightly
sweeter
the
rye
bread
is
toastier
and
some
black
pepper
and
cinnamon
find
their
ways
in
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
mostly
solid
ofest
but
one
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
crowd
in
any
appreciable
manner
it
rises
above
the
light
cabbage
character
but
it
doesnt
soar
still
not
bad
though
especially
for
the
price
poured
this
500
ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
golden
yellow
will
a
nice
amount
of
white
head
and
crisp
carbonation
smell
is
light
and
airy
taste
it
a
little
bland
on
my
end
i
have
tried
a
few
other
octoberfest
beers
and
this
one
for
me
falls
a
little
short
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
bit
new
to
the
style
but
having
came
from
a
love
of
ipas
maybe
that
has
skewed
my
pallet
i
do
like
that
it
is
brewed
with
the
purity
laws
but
there
just
isent
enough
umph
to
this
brew
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
great
sessionable
brew
the
feel
is
creamy
silky
and
smooth
with
a
nice
vibrancy
to
the
carbonation
this
is
clearly
fresh
and
as
a
result
the
beer
displays
a
remarkable
balance
once
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
enjoyed
pours
a
clear
light
copper
orange
with
a
huge
3
inch
puffy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
craggy
cap
a
nice
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
honey
and
some
caramel
notes
taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
caramel
honey
and
some
mild
hop
flavors
there
is
a
very
mild
grainy
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
probably
my
favorite
of
all
beers
in
this
style
i
have
tried
i
could
easily
put
down
lots
of
this
one
at
an
oktoberfest
celebration
ive
always
been
enamoured
with
celebrator
so
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
in
the
world
perfect
beer
for
the
season
it
pours
a
caramelstraw
color
with
some
foam
and
head
retention
tight
lacing
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
theres
no
hop
profile
to
speak
of
consistent
with
the
style
but
the
hops
there
provide
a
nice
spice
and
balance
to
the
malty
flavor
of
the
beer
its
refreshing
in
a
way
starting
out
crisp
with
a
some
caramel
on
a
subdued
sweet
finish
that
i
think
of
as
characteristically
marzen
the
flavors
hold
up
as
it
warms
really
a
terrific
beer
one
of
my
favorites
and
real
treat
for
the
season
up
front
biscuity
malt
slight
sweetness
and
then
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
slight
hop
profile
and
faint
yeast
in
the
finish
refreshing
to
say
the
least
i
didnt
look
at
the
grade
on
this
before
i
did
this
review
but
i
would
say
it
would
have
to
rank
in
the
top
ten
for
the
style
i
was
excited
to
find
this
beer
at
midtown
wine
sprits
nashville
tn
and
immediately
grabbed
one
i
enjoy
the
octoberfest
beers
and
have
typically
had
american
versions
in
the
past
the
beer
is
quite
bubbly
and
pours
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
color
of
the
beer
is
golden
tan
taste
the
taste
was
great
it
felt
like
a
true
octoberfest
and
id
gladly
have
this
over
american
versions
it
was
malty
and
had
a
unique
biscuit
flavor
a
little
sweet
but
the
finish
was
very
smooth
very
easy
drinking
beer
im
hoping
to
grab
a
few
for
the
fridge
before
they
vanish
for
the
season
also
this
beer
has
one
of
the
most
awesome
caps
if
you
collect
beer
caps
oktoberfest
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
nice
maltforward
beverage
quite
good
but
i
would
expect
no
less
from
ayinger
another
selection
at
the
2011
choctaw
oktoberfest
it
went
great
with
the
smoked
bratwurst
and
grilled
knackwurst
cleanly
malty
with
the
typical
bread
crust
biscuit
and
barley
husk
character
of
munichtype
malts
light
on
the
caramel
character
which
in
my
mind
is
the
better
way
to
brew
this
style
hops
run
about
even
with
the
malt
lending
plenty
of
spiciness
to
balance
it
manages
to
capture
the
dry
yet
malty
palate
that
separates
the
best
of
the
style
another
welldone
beer
from
brauerei
aying
o
good
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
easily
sessionable
d
this
drinks
quite
nicely
i
really
love
this
beer
overall
i
think
its
decent
i
personally
would
like
a
lot
more
malt
in
there
also
the
metallic
taste
in
there
really
kills
it
had
better
oktoberfest
beers
for
sure
ill
spare
one
the
formalities
this
beer
is
awesome
ive
been
meaning
to
try
one
of
the
ayinger
brands
since
theyve
come
into
this
market
or
when
ive
been
traveling
but
the
opportunity
hadnt
presented
itself
im
a
fan
of
marzen
beers
but
this
one
is
quit
different
slightly
lighter
in
color
and
flavor
than
the
traditional
exports
ive
had
and
ive
had
most
of
them
this
one
i
could
drink
all
day
a
very
pretty
beer
not
for
the
spice
and
pumpkin
crowd
but
if
you
enjoy
traditional
german
fare
this
one
is
a
must
overall
id
drink
this
again
i
am
starting
to
see
a
pattern
in
german
beers
and
i
think
i
like
it
its
a
refreshing
change
from
all
of
the
new
beers
that
american
breweries
have
been
churning
out
lately
tradition
is
often
good
it
is
in
this
case
taste
sweet
and
bready
malt
with
slight
hit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
o
while
theres
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
its
a
very
good
well
made
example
of
the
style
not
every
beer
has
to
blow
my
socks
off
most
of
the
time
im
looking
for
something
thats
just
plain
good
and
this
fits
the
bill
perfectly
overall
very
impressive
would
have
any
time
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
german
oktober
fest
brew
the
mouthfeel
steps
it
up
slightly
with
a
solid
carbonation
the
strong
fizz
brightens
the
lazy
malt
bill
and
keeps
it
worth
drinking
all
in
all
just
an
average
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
märzenoktoberfest
biers
nothing
flashy
just
rocksolid
good
really
puts
me
in
the
mood
for
fall
and
i
want
another
one
immediately
prost
oh
to
be
in
munich
for
oktoberfest
and
holding
a
liter
of
this
in
a
mug
tasty
balanced
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
musthave
fall
beer
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
i
thought
nothing
could
dethrone
great
lakes
oktoberfest
but
at
least
it
lost
to
a
german
brewery
reviewed

after
reading
all
of
the
positive
things
about
this
beer
i
have
to
wonder
what
i
am
missing
this
is
an
average
beer
overall
at
best
and
thats
not
even
to
speak
for
its
ranks
in
the
style
lacks
in
so
many
areas
that
i
cant
believe
the
overall
rating
that
it
holds
i
wont
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
overall
drinkability
a
solidly
good
marzen
beer
i
suspect
this
would
be
much
better
with
food
but
by
itself
its
quite
nice
definitely
better
when
warm
than
cold
but
hey
thats
on
purpose
isnt
it
surprisingly
average
given
the
hype
maybe
i
am
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
or
of
brauerei
aying
similar
to
sam
adams
octoberfest
other
than
the
distinctive
yeast
profile
good
but
not
special
strong
caramel
malt
hardly
any
hop
character
slightly
bitter
finish
standard
oktoberfest
appearance
and
mouthfeel
o
very
good
brew
perfect
way
to
welcome
fall
everything
is
well
balanced
and
finishes
clean
the
earthy
notes
are
impressive
feels
like
drinking
the
fall
season
o
a
tasty
marzen
and
one
i
recommend
awesomely
delcious
very
good
seek
this
out
overall
i
must
admit
that
i
am
drinking
this
a
little
out
of
season
the
aromas
and
taste
bring
me
to
the
cool
fall
months
nice
and
mild
nothing
too
crazy
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
o
this
is
a
solid
lager
it
was
very
refreshing
at
the
end
of
a
rough
day
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
great
its
has
some
great
flavors
a
great
märzenoktoberfest
that
was
refreshing
but
a
little
different
then
its
fellow
brews
in
the
style
i
will
have
to
seek
out
more
brews
from
this
german
brewery
very
prickly
and
drinkable
very
good
wiesenbier
d
again
i
would
like
a
properly
cellered
version
of
this
to
try
but
as
it
i
would
be
able
to
drink
two
or
three
of
these
feels
like
it
would
be
a
good
late
summerearly
fall
beer
pours
a
light
clear
golden
with
a
full
white
head
that
is
gone
rather
quickly
leaving
behind
no
lacing
to
speak
of
this
has
a
fairly
significant
amount
of
grass
and
lemon
aromas
to
it
fresh
after
the
pour
as
it
sits
for
a
short
spell
it
takes
on
a
nice
sweet
honey
aroma
and
rich
caramel
malts
rather
mild
on
the
palatte
but
yet
not
short
of
complexity
hay
and
citrus
fruits
are
first
noticeable
and
are
quickly
followed
with
honey
the
finish
is
a
little
short
and
light
truth
be
told
im
not
a
big
oktoberfest
beer
fan
i
apologize
still
this
is
a
damn
good
oktberfest
d
pretty
darn
good
beer
sweet
but
not
syrupy
spices
are
integrated
well
fine
example
of
the
style
cheers
its
slightly
over
carbonated
out
of
the
bottle
but
if
your
at
oktoberfest
chugging
away
this
will
be
a
great
beer
to
have
all
day
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimple
glass
one
of
my
top
rated
oktoberfests
poured
an
amber

rich
nose
of
toasted
toffee

well
balanced

round
to
a
light

finish
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
dry
malt
finish
overall
is
it
a
marzen
or
a
festival
lager
are
they
the
same
who
cares
what
style
its
defined
as
this
is
a
great
bavarian
beer
and
everyone
regardless
of
being
a
craft
beer
snob
or
an
usual
american
adjunct
bozo
should
enjoy
this
one
d
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
slow
drinker
sweetness
grows
on
me
over
time
to
slow
things
down
a
bit
too
d
they
need
to
make
this
in
6
packs
and
available
year
round
i
will
pick
this
up
again
wow
one
of
the
lagers
that
has
really
impressed
me
this
is
a
legitimate
oktoberfest
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
highly
recommend
this
pours
an
orangeamber
with
a
two
finger
pearl
white
head
quickly
dissipated
but
lacing
remained
solid
aroma
of
honey
sweetness
and
caramel
notes
taste
begins
with
more
of
the
same
sweet
blast
of
honey
and
caramel
followed
by
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
middle
and
a
big
tosted
grain
finish
good
flavor
combination
light
mouthfeel
drinkability
highly
drinkable
d
one
of
my
first
german
marzens
very
nice
good
and
complex
flavor
with
a
good
abv
worth
looking
for
the
nose
detects
the
cloying
subtleness
of
honey
and
apple
the
palate
succumbs
to
sweet
caramel
balanced
with
toasty
malt
that
provides
the
necessary
warm
finish
a
wonderful
expression
of
a
much
maligned
style
prosit
d
delicious
example
of
this
style
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
in
an
afternoon
especially
with
grilled
brats
and
sauerkraut
this
will
be
my
last
oktoberfest
of
2010
i
feel
like
i
ended
on
a
good
one
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
toward
the
lighter
end
of
the
styles
color
spectrum
straddling
ambercopper
this
pours
with
a
head
at
the
start
but
it
had
a
previous
engagement
apparently
disappearing
quick
straightforward
sweet
malt
aroma
inline
stylewise
clean
with
some
surprising
noble
hop
presence
real
distant
a
bit
floral
and
oxidized
as
it
warms
up
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
the
flavor
boasts
some
roasted
nut
and
caramel
aspects
strange
for
the
style
so
ive
read
the
malt
profile
is
clean
and
has
a
lightmoderate
toasted
angle
to
it
however
it
finishes
with
a
thin
vegetable
essence
a
livelyenough
level
of
carbonation
washes
much
of
that
away
in
the
end
not
too
shabby
this
ayinger
id
certainly
try
drinking
it
with
some
german
cuisine
when
i
can
some
of
those
perceived
offflavors
though
while
not
ruining
this
will
surely
steer
me
toward
other
examples
of
the
style
4
out
of
5
times
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
surprisingly
thirst
quenching
this
enhances
its
drinkability
carbonation
is
tingly
and
pleasant
drinkability
is
high
as
this
was
designed
for
mass
consumption
overall
a
very
good
fest
beer
d
has
a
savory
quality
that
could
possibly
deter
one
from
drinking
several
steins
but
it
is
fresh
it
is
clean
it
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
although
with
a
quality
that
will
prevent
you
from
stuffing
too
many
into
your
gi
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
german
oktoberfest
i
wish
i
could
get
more
ayinger
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
good
stuff
now
this
is
a
lager
high
drinkability
as
i
could
drink
this
all
night
on
its
own
or
with
a
meal
a
really
good

a

with

a
refreshing
beer
great
cold
i
could
drink
several
of
these
happily
when
the
mood
strikes
probably
a
great
beer
for
the
style
but
just
not
for
me
at
this
point
of
my
beer
journey
500

the

with

of

never
goes
away
sweet
and
roasted
malts
greet
the
nose
in
an
inviting
fashion
the
creamy
body
leads
to
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
taste
which
is
almost
honey
like
there
is
a
nice
roastiness
and
pleasant
dryer
finish
a
very
nice
octoberfest
beer
from
those
who
know
how
to
do
it
right
great
beer
one
that
i
will
be
drinking
again
i
really
enjoyed
it
of
all
octoberfest
beers
i
had
this
falli
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
it
smelled
like
honey
when
i
opened
it
the
beer
has
a
dark
golden
haze
to
it
a
lil
carbonation
and
foam
the
taste
is
fresh
clovefruitmalty
flavor
very
smooth
tasting
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
wish
i
had
more
looking
foward
to
getting
more
beers
by
ayinger
a
real
light
orangey
yellow
color
the
head
was
simiclear
thin
off
white
head
the
nose
was
odd
i
cant
really
pin
point
anything
it
is
a
little
skunky
and
a
little
bitter
nice
mouth
feel
there
is
some
earthy
and
leathery
taste
some
nice
walnut
or
pecan
nuttiness
however
the
finish
is
light
this
is
a
good
beer
and
great
for
the
season
but
it
seems
like
its
missing
something
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
does
feel
a
bit
unorganized
just
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
again
this
is
a
tough
style
of
beer
with
many
amazing
competitors
drink
again
i
just
really
like
what
ayinger
does
call
me
biased
this
is
a
solid
product
an
oktoberfest
with
great
yeast
character
good
all
around
i
wish
it
was
cheaper
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
just
a
tad
of
sweetness
to
it
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
a
style
im
not
really
familiar
with
but
it
went
down
awful
fast
good
oktoberfest
although
i
was
more
impressed
by
it
last
year
this
year
i
preferred
the
more
complex
flavors
of
paulaners
if
only
i
could
combine
those
flavors
with
this
mouthfeel
this
is
a
tastey
brew
but
not
my
personal
fav
i
still
like
hacker
pschorr
marzenoktoberfest
the
best
this
is
not
too
far
off
i
bit
more
carmel
sweetness
to
it
excellent
beer
nonetheless
very
pricey
in
my
area
60
case
of
beer
is
pushing
my
pricing
point
i
love
great
beer
but
thats
getting
crazy
for
a
fest
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
try
it
its
a
solid
offering
m
d
rich
medium
body
with
supereasy
drinkability
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
mug
showed
a
deep
caramel
orangebrown
with
a
thick
white
head
with
tremendous
retention
and
lacing
smell
was
sweet
with
bready
malts
caramel
and
brown
sugar
some
faint
earthy
hops
as
well
taste
was
full
and
chewy
with
the
caramel
sweetness
playing
big
and
balanced
by
some
hop
dryness
in
the
finish
not
typically
a
fan
of
oktoberfest
beers
but
this
was
incredible
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
certainly
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
while
i
can
notes
im
not
particularly
familiar
with
the
style
but
im
not
exactly
impressed
while
it
is
a
good
beer
that
id
drink
on
many
occasions
it
isnt
great
dimpled
mug
for
this
guy
first
thing
i
notice
about
the
beer
is
the
clarity
its
very
clear
the
next
thing
i
notice
is
the
aroma
which
i
can
smell
from
where
im
sitting
my
glass
is
about
an
arms
length
away
next
we
have
the
head
which
is
rocky
with
inconsistent
large
and
small
bubbles
as
it
fades
the
head
retention
is
strange
it
looks
like
fat
suspended
in
broth
lets
hope
it
doesnt
taste
like
that
aroma
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
farm
kind
of
like
damp
straw
damp
leaves
maybe
color
is
amber
moving
to
gold
a
little
bit
darker
than
a
pumpkin
taste
is
light
with
a
slightly
salt
water
mineral
finish
mouthfeel
isnt
sticky
more
along
the
lines
of
creamy
lager
yeast
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
as
it
dominates
everything
from
the
nose
of
the
beer
into
the
first
taste
i
expected
this
to
have
more
malt
characteristics
honestly
and
they
are
there
to
be
sure
though
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
like
instead
hops
are
the
focus
with
some
grassy
dandelion
hops
lending
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
to
the
whole
thing
i
find
this
beer
strangely
drinkable
its
not
like
anything
ive
had
before
and
thats
always
surprising
distinctive
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
d
i
have
finally
found
the
best
märzen
of
the
season
the
germans
have
been
doing
it
for
centuries
and
they
still
do
it
better
than
anybody
else
d
very
drinkable
and
this
is
preferable
to
some
of
its
peers
the
flavor
has
sweet
and
bready
malt
mild
hops
and
some
earthiness
smooth
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
modest
carbonation
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
which
i
would
buy
again
not
super
aggressive
or
crazy
which
can
be
a
nice
change
from
other
fall
seasonals
especially
for
the
price
d
i
thought
it
was
uppertier
i
preferred
this
to
the
paulaner
version
but
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
new
glarus
staghorn
in
my
opinion
its
heftier
than
the
paulaner
and
hackerpschorr
interpretations
so
i
would
prefer
those
on
drinkability
for
me
an
oktoberfest
is
something
i
should
be
able
to
finish
a
stein
of
i
was
in
germany
last
year
this
is
what
they
do
d
at
first
the
mixtures
of
flavors
threw
me
off
but
after
i
spent
some
time
with
it
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
solid
beer
glad
to
finally
try
this
one
a
beautiful
light
orange
amber
great
big
fluffy
white
head
nice
lacing
a
nice
looking
beer
not
much
aroma
little
bread
and
yeast
aroma
nice
sweet
malty
taste
not
as
heavy
as
some
marzens
can
be
a
really
nice
session
beer
this
is
what
a
good
octoberfest
should
be
m
smoth
nice
carbonation
could
be
a
little
creamiersmoother
drinkability
this
stuff
taste
pretty
good
and
the
aftertaste
is
really
pleasant
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
of
the
better
märzens
d
this
is
marked
by
fantastic
subtleties
it
is
light
yet
flavorful
and
is
completely
unoffensive
in
every
way
pours
an
orangish
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
malty
bready
and
earthy
taste
is
malty
with
caramel
sweetness
and
some
hops
bitterness
mediumlight
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
everything
works
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
but
the
carbonation
lightens
the
feel
and
keeps
the
palate
clean
although
the
flavor
profile
leans
more
malty
and
sweet
theres
enough
hop
spice
to
keep
things
balanced
and
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
marzens
ive
had
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
love
this
id
prefer
many
of
the
local
octoberfests
new
glarus
summit
point
maybe
even
leinies
d
certainly
an
easy
drinker
i
downed
my
500
ml
bottle
rather
quickly
and
could
have
gone
for
another
this
may
be
my
favorite
marzen
to
date
a
very
balanced
solid
and
tasty
ceremonial
lager
the
kind
where
just
less
than
a
single
digit
of
abv
uptick
can
make
all
the
difference
ergo
i
can
totally
see
the
appeal
of
downing
1
liter
steins
of
this
kind
of
stuff
amongst
thousands
of
likeminded
imbibers
especially
if
they
too
are
choosing
this
kickass
bavarian
brewer
pours
a
big
three
finger
plus
head
yet
so
loosely
knit
and
comprised
of
huge
bubbles
that
it
is
gone
almost
before
you
can
try
to
measure
it
zero
lacing
as
well
bright
orange
amber
color
with
a
metallic
cast
clear
and
transparent
abundant
streams
of
bubbles
visible
especially
after
first
poured
sweet
bready
malty
nose
full
of
molasses
honey
caramel
fruit
cake
golden
raisin
date
apple
fruit
orange
glaze
with
some
milk
chocolate
for
good
measure
a
dried
graininess
appears
as
you
acclimate
to
it
lighterbodied
with
plenty
of
fizzy
carbonation
to
keep
it
swirling
actively
from
start
to
finish
its
inherent
sweetness
helps
it
gain
some
traction
honey
sweet
butter
maple
syrup
orange
peel
root
beer
and
chocolate
bits
pretty
up
things
first
challah
bread
croissant
flakes
and
buttermilk
up
next
keeps
that
golden
raisin
date
aspect
but
blends
in
fresher
apple
pear
apricot
flavors
too
as
with
the
nose
it
is
not
like
theres
no
hops
at
all
they
just
seem
to
fill
in
cracks
rather
than
stand
center
stage
this
is
about
the
perfect
bottle
size
for
the
flavors
any
more
and
it
would
get
tedious
good
beer
but
im
just
not
that
fond
of
marzens
drinkability
malty
but
not
really
sweet
a
top
notch
brew
from
ayinger
i
tried
it
about
two
weeks
ago
so
i
cant
give
you
any
details
at
this
point
all
i
know
is
i
have
to
get
more
for
my
taste
its
much
better
than
the
hackerpschorr
oktoberfest
which
i
just
tried
last
weekend
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
clear
amber
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
thick
frothy
looking
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
soapy
lacing
all
along
the
side
the
smell
is
toasty
malts
and
minimal
hops
to
be
found
hints
of
vanilla
and
tea
peer
through
if
autumn
has
a
smell
this
is
certainly
it
big
malt
flavor
that
mostly
overshadows
everything
else
slightly
biscuity
and
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
the
taste
is
leaving
me
somewhat
underwhelmed
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
lively
as
i
had
expected
with
the
carbonation
so
visible
im
surprised
by
the
lack
of
it
in
my
mouth
this
is
smooth
and
leaves
me
with
a
buttery
kind
of
sensation
on
my
buds
ill
be
able
to
drink
this
just
fine
but
it
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
very
unlikely
ill
snag
this
again
a
great
example
to
the
style
and
especially
inviting
if
you
can
find
it
on
draught
drinkability
quite
good
indeed
i
could
probably
quaff
these
all
day
long
preferably
in
a
long
tent
with
a
few
thousand
new
friends
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
the
great
october
beer
did
i
mention
that
this
stuff
is
good
mouthfeel
light
bodied
that
is
crisp
and
clean
d
i
had
to
keep
myself
from
chugging
this
it
really
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
but
it
also
has
enough
weight
to
it
to
make
it
very
enjoyable
on
a
cool
october
evening
d
very
high
for
the
style
and
season
the
only
way
to
describe
it
is
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
soft
and
delicious
clearly
a
very
clean
fermentation
very
slightly
acidic
at
the
end
of
the
sip
super
balanced
quality
craft
brew
very
high
so
far
if
i
had
to
pick
1
oktoberfest
brew
it
would
be
this
one
great
taste
great
mouthfeel
since
this
isnt
anywhere
near
my
favorite
style
i
was
careful
to
grade
it
based
on
what
makes
the
representatives
of
this
style
really
stand
out
ive
had
a
few
marzens
that
i
enjoyed
more
while
in
germany
but
for
what
ive
had
stateside
this
one
is
a
cant
miss
ayinger
oktober
festmarzen
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
large
offwhite
head
that
didnt
last
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
toasty
malt
with
a
little
spice
coming
through
towards
the
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
just
over
medium
carbonation
drinkabity
was
very
good
this
is
a
tasty
oktoberfest
and
worth
trying
d
high
marks
here
since
you
could
quaff
this
for
awhile
overall
having
recently
traveled
to
munich
i
have
come
to
learn
that
the
strict
limitations
of
ingredients
stemming
from
the
purity
law
result
in
fantastic
simple
and
incredibly
fresh
tasting
beer
this
is
no
exception
a
friend
of
mine
who
works
at
a
distributer
recommended
this
as
being
his
favorite
oktober
fest
beer
and
now
i
can
confidently
say
that
i
fully
agree
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
excellent
example
of
the
style
you
should
try
it
prost
this
is
very
sweet
and
malty
for
an
octoberfest
which
is
saying
something
since
fest
beers
should
be
sweet
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
this
beer
is
quiet
drinkable
but
do
not
expect
your
typical
fest
beer
this
one
is
uniquly
malty
d
pretty
good
that
aftertaste
makes
this
lessthanquaffable
but
it
still
goes
down
pretty
easy
d
great
beer
i
still
think
that
paulaner
makes
a
better
oktoberfest
but
this
one
is
a
close
second
i
think
the
malthops
balance
is
a
little
better
in
paulaner
still
im
most
likely
going
to
be
buying
more
of
this
beer
before
theyre
gone
for
the
year
great
to
see
this
in
bc
as
we
have
been
lacking
in
real
ok
fest
beers
pours
mid
gold
with
a
great
hop
nose
i
love
the
thick
mouthfeel
with
the
hoppy
midbody
this
is
a
well
made
marzen
with
all
the
right
flavours
a
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
makes
it
oh
so
drinkable
d
not
amazingly
tasty
over
here
but
very
decent
and
very
easy
to
quaff
notes
good
brew
maybe
the
best
octoberfest
ive
had
so
far
this
fall
pours
an
almost
clear
caramel
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
a
bit
grainy
with
some
nice
smelling
malts
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
a
faint
hop
presence
the
taste
is
awesome
the
taste
is
a
lot
better
than
the
smell
imo
all
the
scents
from
the
nose
are
present
in
the
flavor
but
much
more
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
but
crisp
at
the
same
time
this
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfest
beers
so
far
drinkability
is
high
aroma
is
caramelly
and
bready
with
a
good
level
of
fragrance
the
flavor
has
the
same
aspects
with
a
touch
of
toffee
layered
in
its
very
malty
and
rich
but
has
a
light
and
crisp
feeling
as
well
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
had
plans
for
a
different
brew
after
but
i
decided
to
pour
another
half
liter
of
this
instead
dcould
see
this
going
perfectly
with
octoberfest
activities
but
didnt
wow
me
that
said
it
does
go
down
very
easily
d
highly
drinkable
i
wished
i
had
bought
more
after
i
drank
this
appearance
is
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
decent
frothy
light
tan
head
smells
of
starchy
grains
semisweet
with
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
dry
clove
taste
is
fairly
strong
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
fresh
cinnamon
silage
mild
lemon
hop
as
a
minor
character
the
carbonation
is
light
and
smooth
body
pretty
light
sweetness
thin
and
tasteless
like
sugar
syrup
a
bit
too
thin
not
enough
malt
sweetness
out
of
place
this
is
a
tasty
quaffable
festbier
with
some
surprising
flavors
for
a
lager
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
all
around
i
typically
drink
only
1
or
2
a
year
and
as
always
im
left
satisfied
a
perfect
beer
for
those
55
degree
days
when
the
leaves
start
to
turn
price
3
50
d
wow
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
make
this
one
lead
the
pack
for
me
id
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
in
germany
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
could
put
down
a
1l
stein
of
this
no
problem
smooth
lager
a
nice
crisp
bite
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
like
the
oktoberfest
malty
taste
the
flavors
are
very
well
done
d
i
could
enjoy
this
all
day
not
quite
in
sessionville
but
damn
close
and
i
dont
mind
if
i
end
the
day
a
little
tipsy
dvery
solid
oktoberfest
could
drink
this
all
night
pours
a
somewhat
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
tiny
bits
of
lacing
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hoppiness
coming
through
taste
is
similar
and
is
somewhat
buoyed
by
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
not
much
alcohol
presence
on
a
medium
body
drikability
is
okay
nothing
is
particularly
wrong
with
the
beer
but
theres
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
dnot
bad
on
drinkability
not
one
of
ayingers
better
beers
tho
overall
on
the
eve
of
the
first
weekend
of
oktoberfest
this
beer
brings
back
great
bavarian
memories
from
my
first
trip
to
germany
fantastic
authenticity
which
gives
a
cozy
feeling
on
a
latesummer
evening
the
painted
bottle
caps
are
a
nice
touch
too
d
very
drinkable
could
have
a
couple
of
liters
of
this
every
fall
the
best
food
pairing
with
this
beer
will
no
doubt
be
regional
try
it
with
the
traditional
bavarian
cuisine
that
you
would
find
at
oktoberfest
pretzels
goulash
wiener
schnitzel
bratwursts
and
sauerkraut
would
all
be
delicious
with
this
one
the
rich
maltiness
of
the
beer
also
plays
well
against
the
meaty
nutlike
character
of
a
swiss
cheese
such
as
appenzeller
which
is
washed
in
white
wine
and
cider
or
a
raw
milk
caveaged
gruyere
a
toasty
salty
cheese
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
highly
sessionable
mediumbodied
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
imo
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
for
a
strict
run
of
one
or
two
then
experiences
a
steep
dropoff
german
lagers
like
these
are
often
overlookedyes
we
still
think
the
world
needs
more
lagers
this
is
a
classican
exceptional
and
flavorful
alternative
for
the
ongoing
lightening
of
the
celebratory
märzen
d
great
i
find
it
one
of
the
better
balanced
sweet
beers
i
could
use
this
with
dinner
casually
drinking
or
as
a
session
brew
swiss
army
knife
of
beers
taste
is
not
as
up
front
as
most
oktoberfests
i
have
had
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
some
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
very
slick
and
wet
this
is
very
appealing
i
would
suggest
this
one
fairly
cool
when
drinking
i
could
drink
this
all
day
too
bad
im
not
willing
to
pay
what
it
would
cost
to
drink
this
all
day
really
though
i
think
this
is
one
to
savor
because
getting
blitzed
on
this
you
would
lose
the
subtlety
that
makes
it
so
great
awesome
oktoberfest
beer
as
usual
ayinger
doesnt
disappoint
they
have
made
such
an
incredible
lager
with
a
flavor
balance
that
most
brewers
could
only
dream
about
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
whenever
i
feel
like
treating
myself
dnot
bad
on
drinkability
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
i
expected
more
from
this
one
based
on
reputation
and
the
quality
of
their
dopplebock
overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
goes
down
smooth
finish
is
clean
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
there
as
well
not
complex
but
very
good
good
representation
of
the
style
to
quote
bjcp
this
is
one
of
the
classic
malty
styles
with
a
maltiness
that
is
often
described
as
soft
complex
and
elegant
but
never
cloying
however
as
a
beer
its
not
something
that
i
would
designate
as
must
have
this
has
that
pretty
amber
color
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
sweet
maybe
caramelish
the
first
thing
i
tasted
was
the
sweet
caramel
that
shines
through
on
the
nose
but
after
the
initial
taste
there
is
a
good
deal
of
spicy
tingliness
on
the
tongue
it
feels
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
but
because
of
that
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
without
difficulty
pretty
good
d
nice
example
of
the
style
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yet
spicy
and
flavorful
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
grilled
sausage
or
braut
on
a
fall
day
d
i
would
definitely
not
complain
at
being
served
this
all
night
prost
first
german
oktoberfestbier
of
the
season
and
america
just
cant
compete
drinkability
while
definitely
good
this
one
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
it
goes
back
to
the
mustiness
wouldve
liked
less
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
more
roast
character
within
reason
tasty
and
drinkable
though
not
as
impressive
as
other
offerings
from
ayinger
pours
into
my
mug
a
crystal
clear
copper
with
a
white
head
that
fills
the
glass
but
soon
drops
to
a
thin
sheet
sweet
bready
german
malt
aroma
clean
lager
notes
and
a
pinch
of
noble
hops
toasted
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
spice
flavors
crisp
clean
and
lightly
bitter
hints
of
dough
mediumlight
bodied
smooth
and
dry
in
the
finish
refreshing
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
i
definitely
wont
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
have
this
beer
when
it
is
available
in
the
fall
pours
light
orangeamber
with
a
rich
white
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
bready
grains
and
a
bit
of
yeast
most
certainly
caramel
grains
taste
is
very
crisp
primarily
caramel
malt
which
overpowers
mild
hop
bitterness
the
maltyeast
combination
is
reminiscent
of
white
crackers
mouthfeel
is
excellent
very
crisp
and
medium
carbonation
perfectly
matched
to
the
malts
feel
very
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
pours
a
very
bright
orange
color
with
a
large
2
finger
fluffy
head
with
sup
rising
lacing
and
retention
for
a
marzen
the
coloring
is
simply
amazing
and
the
body
is
perfectly
clear
the
aroma
has
a
distinct
cooked
sweet
potato
aroma
bready
malts
follow
with
a
clove
or
allspice
undertone
also
has
a
touch
of
that
german
lager
yeasty
aroma
the
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
with
focused
bready
malty
flavors
there
is
also
a
semi
spicy
flavor
that
flows
nicely
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
spot
on
with
classic
oktoberfests
unlike
american
versions
this
is
light
and
refreshing
and
easily
put
down
rather
quickly
well
worth
the
3
bucks
for
this
bottle
d
smooth
and
relatively
mellow
with
nicely
balanced
flavors
very
happy
with
the
abv
and
will
likely
grab
again

just
an
allaround
good
beer
very
subtle
but
everything
is
reminiscent
of
fall
and
it
is
so
smooth
it
just
slides
down
your
throat
so
its
easy
to
take
down
a
couple
of
these
good
connectivity
and
a
nice
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
d
nice
oktoberfest
that
being
said
i
still
havent
found
a
great
okotoberfest
stateside
this
is
a
pretty
basicstraightforward
oktoberfest
not
overly
complex
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
it
may
not
have
any
tricks
up
its
sleave
but
it
is
a
nearly
perfect
example
of
what
german
oktoberfests
represent
this
is
good
stuff
to
be
honest
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
complex
aspects
to
this
beer
but
it
goes
great
with
the
food
its
intended
for
i
see
myself
picking
up
some
more
next
time
im
at
ottos
for
my
sausage
fix
drinkability
is
nice
dusted
off
the
500ml
myself
cheers
sorry
ayinger
you
can
do
a
lot
better
ps
love
the
cap
to
me
this
is
a
grand
example
of
a
marzenfest
beer
tasting
very
fresh
and
generously
delicious
this
went
great
with
onions
dipped
in
hummus
easy
to
drink
but
the
hops
provides
a
fun
little
bite
at
the
end
drinkability
is
great
easy
drinker
but
good
for
cooler
weather
not
very
heavily
bodied
which
is
nice
poured
a
very
nice
orangecopper
color
with
some
very
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
decent
scent
with
a
nice
crisp
maltiness
though
nothing
very
deep
excellent
taste
a
very
nice
burnished
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
leaves
turning
color
goes
down
exceptionally
well
d
light
overall
flavor
but
marzen
is
made
to
be
very
drinkable
wishing
this
came
in
liter
bottles
overall
a
very
quaffable
beer
though
if
i
were
to
open
another
bottle
i
think
the
sweetness
would
be
cloying
by
the
end
of
it
drinking
this
makes
me
want
to
sit
on
the
porch
and
watch
the
leaves
change
color
and
i
think
thats
great
d
drinkable
to
be
sure
very
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
that
being
said
i
found
this
beer
based
on
the
brewery
and
the
style
to
be
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
not
a
bad
beer
just
underwhelming
although
on
the
sweeter
side
the
malt
presence
in
this
beer
does
not
make
the
flavor
overwhelming
and
when
combined
with
its
light
body
and
crisp
refreshness
you
get
one
sessionable
brew
i
could
definitely
see
an
all
day
boozefest
centered
around
this
beer
rerate
814
much
better
pretty
much
all
around
and
in
every
way
wow
rerate
is
ridiculously
higher
date
the
bottle
please
d
after
a
long
day
at
work
this
hit
the
spot
picked
up
the
last
bottle
at
the
corner
store
and
glad
i
did
will
look
for
this
in
the
future
another
great
brew
from
ayinger
d
really
nice
to
drink
nice
mix
of
the
caramel
and
citrus
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
bit
lighter
than
alot
of
marzen
beers
another
gem
from
the
ayinger
brewery
which
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
i
will
be
seeking
more
of
this
as
its
the
best
marzen
ive
has
thus
far
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
so
drinkability
is
quite
high
overall
a
really
enjoyable
german
oktoberfest
beer

reminds
me
of
grape
nuts
the
taste
is
decently

forward
sweet

some
hops
to

with

you
get
that
good

complexity
that
only
seems
to
come
from
germany
a

of

sweetness
crisp

clean
with
a
fair

of
noble

in

great

quality
and
an

i
dont
know
if
the

is
suffiecent
in
comparison
to
the
range
of
flavor
though
not
as
sweet
as
some
which
is
really
nice
thin
but
complex
it
seems
to
loss
a
lot
as
it
airs
out

warms
up

just

one
of
the
best
marzen
for
some
that

do
a
heftier
marzen
drinkability
this
is
what
an
oktoberfest
should
taste
like
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorite
fall
brews
the
ayinger
marzen
pours
a
pale
amber
color
almost
golden
very
carbonated
head
that
fizzes
and
dwindles
nose
is
malty
and
quite
sweet

the

palate
is
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
and
hints
of
a
hoppy
bite
with
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
above
average
in
my
opinion
there
are
other
better
marzens
available
but
the
heritage
and
history
that
this
beer
has
keeps
me
coming
back
each
year
this
beer
was
being
sold
as
bombers
in
the
store
where
i
bought
it
the
guy
in
front
of
me
just
grabbed
the
whole
display
and
bought
the
entire
stock
sparing
one
for
me
so
apparently
im
not
alone
when
i
say
that
ayinger
octoberfest
is
pretty
drinkable
i
was
surprised
that
this
was
only
5
80
abv
since
it
was
pretty
easy
to
detect
maybe
it
was
because
it
didnt
take
me
long
to
get
through
the
bottle
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
if
youre
going
to
have
a
beer
to
celebrate
octoberfest
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
maybe
the
most
authentic
stylistically
that
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
lighter
than
i
expected
but
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
nevertheless
very
drinkable
good
german
october
brew
the
beer
pours
a
brilliant
golden
with
copper
hue
and
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
intensely
malty
toasty
bready
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
a
blast
of
malt
sweet
toasty
and
silky
smooth
the
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
dry
finish
provides
a
perfect
counterpoint
to
the
malt
centric
beer
the
body
and
carbonation
are
both
medium
overall
a
great
oktoberfest
highly
recommend
im
having
mine
with
a
crusty
rye
bread
a
fantastic
snack
mfd
the
feel
is
fine
but
the
only
reason
that
the
drinkablilty
suffers
is
because
of
the
blandness
of
the
brew
itself
otherwise
the
drinkability
is
good
a
very
drinkable
festbier
im
afraid
if
i
were
supplied
with
several
maßkrugs
of
this
beer
it
might
disappear
at
an
alarming
rate
easily
in
my
top
five
of
oktoberfest
beers
and
may
be
much
closer
to
the
top
than
that
drink
i
could
spend
all
day
at
the
fest
drinking
this
darn
good
beer
a
true
example
of
the
traditional
german
marzen
great
maltiness
and
the
sweetness
nicely
balanced
by
the
earthy
hops
unbelievably
drinkable
my
only
knock
being
i
wish
there
was
a
touch
more
malt
this
is
a
decent
version
of
the
style
that
in
my
opinion
seems
more
authentic
than
american
versions
overall
a
success
of
an
oktoberfest
drinkable
rich
and
pleasing
d
an
easy
drinking
marzen
flavors
are
well
integrated
not
overwhelming
lightly
filling
due
to
some
of
moderate
carbonation
abv
is
in
line
scorereview
based
on
my
ontap
experience
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
comes
out
a
yellowamber
color
slightly
lighter
than
i
expected
this
beer
has
perfect
clarity
to
it
with
an
off
white
frothy
head
with
many
different
sized
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
i
thought
there
was
some
lacing
but
most
of
it
just
kind
of
crawls
very
slowly
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
good
not
very
strong
smell
of
roasted
or
more
like
toasted
malts
it
has
a
kind
of
clean
smell
if
that
makes
sense
the
taste
is
good
the
taste
is
mostly
comprised
of
caramelized
roasted
malts
it
certainly
one
of
the
sweetest
tasting
oktoberfest
style
beers
ive
ever
had
almost
like
a
toasted
sweet
breaddy
taste
or
grain
the
beer
really
comes
out
with
a
clean
crisp
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
left
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
feeling
but
very
light
bodied
its
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
i
think
this
would
be
more
of
an
early
fall
or
even
late
summer
beer
it
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
day
not
something
id
recommend
for
the
later
fall
season
considering
how
light
it
is
d
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfest
i
havent
had
too
many
oktoberfests
this
year
however
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
purchased
a
bottle
at
wine
gallery
brookline
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
faded
peach
color
attractive
looking
and
moderately
carbonated
average
sized
head
a
bit
malty
in
the
smell
but
not
too
noticeable
tasted
like
an
average
oktoberfest
beer
balanced
and
straightforward
german
what
i
disliked
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
very
sticky
on
the
palate
and
on
the
aftertaste
needs
to
be
cleaned
up
i
can
drink
this
beer
no
issue
there
but
i
would
not
particularly
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
good
oktoberfest
possibly
even
my
favorite
so
far
the
body
was
perhaps
a
little
thinner
than
i
like
for
the
style
drinkability
was
very
good
but
suffered
due
to
the
stickiness
of
the
caramel
overall
a
good
beer
worth
trying
and
worth
having
several
of
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
has
a
medium
creamy
texture
and
very
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
medium
thick
the
finish
is
clean
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
is
a
wonderful
octoberfest
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
not
search
it
out
mouthfeel
is
excellent
good
body
yet
clean
on
the
palate
great
balance
great
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
should
please
most
fans
of
it
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
non
stop
until
nanobots
turn
the
earth
to
grey
goo
it
is
that
yummy
drinkability
i
think
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
perfect
to
go
with
a
meal
and
an
evenings
conversation
with
friends
just
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
to
go
with
a
pleasant
time
it
is
tasty
not
particularly
challenging
but
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
oktoberfest
beer
would
like
to
have
it
by
the
12
oz
bottle
though
rather
than
the
larger
bottle
it
is
a
well
balanced
entry
into
the
field
and
may
be
what
you
want
to
try
first
if
your
pondering
on
which
one
to
choose
i
poured
my
half
liter
bottle
into
my
quarter
liter
german
mug
the
appearance
is
classic
clear
copper
with
ample
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
not
very
intense
but
has
a
nicely
rounded
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
well
rounded
nice
nutty
cereal
malt
and
enough
hops
to
finish
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
clean
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
world
class
for
the
style
oktoberfest
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
from
1
liter
steins
and
this
is
one
i
could
down
all
night
theres
not
a
whole
lot
i
can
really
say
to
describe
the
taste
but
it
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
just
begs
to
be
drunk
certainly
one
that
i
could
drink
plenty
of
at
an
ofest
gathering
d
not
as
flavorful
as
other
october
fests
i
have
had
fill
up
das
boot
and
let
me
pound
it
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
stuff
thin
crisp
and
balanced
in
a
good
way
as
good
a
märzen
as
ive
ever
tried
im
trying
this
against
spatens
version
and
the
ayinger
is
the
clear
winner
the
beer
pours
a
relatively
light
ambergolden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
and
pretty
good
retention
the
beer
smells
of
peaches
apples
and
concord
grapes
its
very
pleasant
even
if
that
description
makes
it
sound
oversweet
its
a
light
but
rich
malty
character
that
transmits
to
the
flavor
quite
well
the
beer
is
has
a
delicate
and
complex
malt
character
that
has
fruit
and
caramel
notes
the
germans
really
know
how
to
tease
out
delicate
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
cuts
out
much
of
the
lingering
sweetness
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
id
be
quite
happy
spending
a
day
drinking
this
beer
out
of
enormous
steins
this
is
a
really
good
marzenofest
something
i
would
recommend
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
pale
amberhoney
color
with
a
nice
dense
khaki
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
nice
ring
and
light
cap
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
doughy
touch
of
caramel
to
go
with
the
munich
malt
some
light
grassy
hops
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
taste
is
quite
neutral
the
caramel
seems
to
offset
the
doughy
malt
characteristics
leaving
a
somewhat
bland
yet
enjoyable
flavor
any
hop
presence
is
minimal
nice
moderate
body
with
tingly
carbonation
sweet
overall
but
balanced
a
nice
marzen
style
german
oktoberfest
the
caramel
flavors
play
nicely
with
the
malt
very
tasty
and
a
good
oktoberfest
to
celebrate
d
very
good
marzen
easy
drinking
and
quite
quaffable
filling
however
i
think
it
is
a
step
below
the
top
of
the
class
hackerpschorr
in
the
category
notes
this
is
a
very
well
made
oktoberfest
to
me
its
like
a
munich
helles
lager
but
a
little
deeper
in
color
richer
and
fuller
in
flavor
and
body
with
the
same
wonderful
drinkability
tastes
of
fresh
grains
doughy
biscuits
banana
toasted
malts
extremely
consistent
flavors
on
the
midpalate
and
finish
very
cohesive
with
a
moderately
bitter
and
crisp
finish
really
some
exceptionally
doughy
flavors
going
on
here
i
havent
experienced
much
a
little
different
than
the
styles
i
have
normally
had
but
some
nice
stuff
here
medium
body
with
a
finemedium
carbonation
that
is
quite
likeable
goes
down
real
easy
real
flavorful
stuff
i
am
enjoying
this
one
a
lot
ayinger
is
a
hell
of
a
brewery
pure
quality
thats
two
down
and
two
to
go
in
the
german
oktoberfest
inviational
ill
be
back
tomorrow
night
to
crack
open
another
bottle
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
that
had
no
evident
date
lovely
golden
with
an
accompanying
fingersized
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
short
time
lacing
present
but
wasnt
ample
the
nose
was
pretty
much
the
usual
oktoberfest
as
was
the
taste
pleasant
crisp
malt
medium
carbonation
not
the
strongest
from
brauerei
aying
but
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
ill
certainly
have
one
again
next
year
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
in
class
sophisticated
malty
lager
though
a
bit
sweet
and
lacking
retention
appropriate
to
the
style
a
fantastic
brewery
but
this
isnt
their
shining
moment
here
solid
ofest
deep
gold
to
amber
in
color
head
quickly
falls
in
to
glass
with
some
lacing
floral
perfume
hops
in
the
nose
with
some
caramel
aroma
toasted
malt
flavor
and
again
the
caramel
comes
through
medium
bodies
and
good
drinking
not
as
robust
as
some
others
but
true
to
style
drinkability
tastes
good
and
maybe
a
little
lighter
than
it
should
be
but
id
have
this
again
a
fairly
robust
oktoberfest
a
bit
too
sweet
and
sticky
for
my
liking
although
it
still
delivers
the
goods
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
marzen
even
if
it
truly
is
not
an
authentic
oktoberfest
its
very
well
rounded
and
very
easy
to
drink
without
getting
boring
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
body
with
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
to
really
make
it
feel
alive
in
your
mouth
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
sodalike
very
clean
flavor
profile
and
a
very
nice
refreshing
quality
for
a
marzen
this
beer
is
in
a
lot
of
ways
very
middleoftheroad
marzen
pour
is
your
typical
auburn
good
but
nothing
unique
mouthfeel
is
fairly
moderate
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
carbonation
the
one
thing
that
really
stood
out
is
theres
a
noticeable
apple
presence
sort
of
like
a
hard
cider
much
more
present
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
the
drinkability
seemed
to
suffer
a
bit
i
wasnt
necessarily
enthralled
with
the
beer
but
it
was
certainly
pretty
good
and
i
would
gladly
take
it
over
many
things
many
other
marzens
even
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
has
a
clear
golden
color
with
two
inches
of
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
weak
with
light
scent
of
malt
and
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
really
surprising
with
the
high
amount
of
noble
hop
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
a
little
sweetness
in
the
front
compliments
the
hops
the
body
feels
a
little
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
is
good
different
from
most
german
oktoberfest
with
the
big
hop
flavor
and
the
malt
being
secondarty
could
use
a
little
more
body
to
make
this
one
the
better
fest
beers
edited
after
having
this
beer
fresh
on
tap
in
munich
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
most
part
but
the
sweetness
kind
of
got
to
me
nice
flavors
and
aromas
the
whole
way
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
needed
something
to
get
that
malt
sweetness
out
of
my
mouth
fresh
tasting
and
smooth
with
some
definite
substance
to
it
very
drinkable
went
down
easy
with
a
couple
of
landjagers
drinkability
a
solid
marzen
overall
a
little
sweeter
than
paulaner
and
not
quite
as
good
while
a
decent
brew
i
honestly
expected
more
dability
a
nice
balanced
malty
lager
way
too
easy
to
drink
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
being
my
first
time
with
an
ayinger
in
recent
memory
not
in
my
mind
what
an
oktoberfest
beer
is
thought
of
in
america
but
will
make
a
lot
of
people
happy
this
fall
d
i
love
this
time
of
year
for
beer
i
look
forward
to
ofests
alot
and
this
is
always
one
of
my
favorites
a
sane
abv
makes
this
easy
to
session
d
an
extremely
drinkable
and
addictive
brew
poss
my
new
fav
imported
ofest
this
is
one
freeking
awesome
beer
fall
is
my
favorite
part
of
beer
season
next
to
spring
summer
and
winter
and
this
year
there
seem
to
be
more
oktoberfests
available
than
ever
before
this
one
is
a
classic
deep
amber
in
color
the
offwhite
head
lasts
a
few
bubbly
minutes
before
fading
and
leaving
a
somewhat
sticky
ring
around
the
glass
caramel
graham
crackers
and
toast
are
all
over
the
aroma
with
hints
of
apples
the
body
is
very
smooth
broken
up
by
a
constant
churn
of
teenyweeny
bubbles
that
fizz
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
in
huge
columns
its
like
drinking
a
glass
of
staccato
the
taste
has
more
caramel
and
crackers
with
a
hint
of
carrots
surprise
but
mostly
this
just
tastes
good
ayinger
cant
do
wrong
poured
a
16
9
oz
bottle
into
a
20
oz
nonic
deep
orange
amber
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
with
hints
of
apple
sweet
bready
malts
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
warm
creamy
dose
of
carame
andl
bread
goodness
which
dries
out
with
a
crisp
finish
a
slight
memory
of
the
malt
lingers
on
this
beer
is
delicious
and
perhaps
a
tad
on
the
less
malty
side
than
some
of
its
german
counterparts
excluding
the
largest
selling
ones
e
g
warsteiner
which
are
less
malty
this
is
a
delicious
quite
drinkable
oktoberfest
in
the
middle
as
far
as
alcohol
maltiness
and
sweetness
well
worth
trying
all
together
a
solid
festbier
lots
of
malt
flavor
matched
well
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
pours
brighter
and
a
little
cloudier
than
most
marzens
great
aroma
complex
and
deep
presence
of
diacetyl
mixed
in
with
caramel
malts
a
great
treat
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
autumn
drinkability
an
outstanding
oktoberfest
one
of
the
best
served
in
this
area
a
good
example
of
an
octoberfest
that
i
will
be
revisiting
next
year
a
very
cool
german
marzen
quite
worth
the
try
cheers
matt
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
scored
points
with
me
the
pleasant
flavors
combined
with
being
quite
low
in
carbonation
encouraged
large
mouthfills
pretty
sure
i
could
polish
off
a
couple
liters
of
this
in
an
evening
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
although
the
malt
flavors
werent
quite
crisp
enough
for
a
marzen
still
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
i
say
its
worth
a
shot
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
in
color
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
aroma
is
good
with
munich
and
veinna
malts
light
toasted
malts
and
clean
lager
characteristics
flavor
is
pretty
good
this
beer
starts
fairly
sweet
but
then
finishes
moderately
dry
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
and
noble
hop
flavor
is
low
both
are
present
near
the
finish
a
complex
malty
character
dominates
with
munich
and
vienna
malts
and
a
toasty
aspect
again
present
mouthfeel
is
good
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
and
a
creamy
texture
drinkability
is
pretty
good
good
complexity
very
enjoyable
nice
gold
in
color
continuous
carbonation
contains
a
great
atumn
pumpkin
tasts
and
some
spice
remains
after
each
sip
all
in
all
a
great
brewespecially
in
the
genre
of
marzen
this
is
a
good
time
of
year
drinkability
truly
refreshing
the
balance
of
hops
and
malts
was
highly
appealing
and
the
carbonation
made
it
quite
refreshing
nice
beer
for
a
cool
late
summerearly
fall
day
and
with
lighter
fare
on
the
grill
ive
yet
to
find
a
beer
from
ayinger
that
i
dont
love
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
d
this
is
what
fall
is
about
bring
on
oktoberfest
and
bring
on
ayinger
i
could
drink
a
fair
bit
of
it
i
like
it
it
might
be
the
ofest
ive
liked
the
best
out
of
what
ive
tried
not
my
favorite
style
poured
amber
with
a
generous
head
that
quickly
faded
the
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
but
did
not
put
me
off
as
i
usually
lose
the
aroma
early
anyway
the
taste
is
sweet
bland
and
a
little
bananaish
if
i
may
use
that
non
word
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
left
over
from
the
head
drinkability
above
average
because
the
beer
is
above
average
too
be
honest
even
after
moving
the
lawn
id
rather
have
any
number
of
lagers
rated
lower
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
price
a
nice
beer
while
eating
dinner
d
a
solid
beer
with
a
lighter
body
than
what
i
was
expecting
fruity
with
a
good
malt
balance
simple
yet
enjoyable
for
sure
drinkability
not
bad
just
not
what
i
expected
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
amber
appearance
decent
lacing
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
too
sweet
for
me
theres
an
overwhelming
caramel
character
that
is
just
too
much
for
me
not
bad
but
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
mochiato
type
drinks
you
get
at
starbucks
overall
great
this
is
essentially
the
staple
for
oktoberfest
beers
delicious
malts
nice
cracked
straw
that
i
wish
was
a
bit
more
prominent
nice
light
caramel
malts
that
dont
come
on
strong
like
most
american
versions
nice
clean
crisp
lager
flavors
that
really
give
this
beer
its
character
the
only
downfall
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
finish
doesnt
dry
as
much
as
it
did
on
previous
batches
and
this
is
as
fresh
as
ive
had
it
before
so
i
think
i
need
to
let
it
condition
a
bit
more
in
the
bottle
and
maybe
that
will
solve
all
the
issues
or
they
just
released
it
a
bit
too
early
this
year
this
is
wonderfully
chuggable
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
octoberfest
dark
gold
color
fresh
smell
a
little
nutty
perhaps
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
oktober
festmarzen
style
easy
to
drink
tastes
delicious
definitely
enjoy
this
with
some
bratwursts
there
are
a
lot
of
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
and
this
one
is
a
good
choice
oktober
festmärzen
is
a
pretty
impressive
beer
especially
for
the
style
its
generally
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
good
one
its
consistent
with
the
style
in
that
its
relatively
simple
but
for
what
it
is
the
flavors
good
the
nose
is
a
tad
weak
and
it
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
body
but
its
pretty
good
stuff
its
definitely
an
oktoberfest
that
you
cant
miss
if
youre
into
the
style
mouthfeel
the
beer
seemed
not
far
from
flat
perhaps
by
design
perhaps
by
bad
regulator
settings
in
any
case
not
much
fizziness
in
the
beer
but
still
a
medium
mouthfeel
a
half
liter
bottle
poured
into
my
great
lakes
dimpled
mug
appears
a
slightly
hazed
deep
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
lingering
off
white
foam
smell
is
dominated
by
malt
biscuits
and
a
light
fruitiness
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
lightly
toasted
grains
green
apples
and
bread
a
great
balance
between
roasty
bitterness
and
the
sweet
malt
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
a
classic
marzen
drinkability
gets
good
marks
no
problem
finishing
this
one
off
and
it
left
me
ready
for
more
nothing
exceptional
but
solid
really
nice
nothing
in
the
least
bit
extreme
but
still
supremely
satisfying
on
one
of
the
first
cool
evenings
of
fall
something
about
the
perfect
balance
of
bready
malt
and
crisp
hops
just
nailed
it
for
for
me
tonight
delicious
orange
blonde
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
lead
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
smells
bready
mildly
herbal
with
some
toffee
and
fruit
tastes
of
toasty
grain
and
rich
buttery
malt
well
balanced
by
bitterness
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
well
made
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
drinkability
for
the
time
of
year
this
is
its
the
perfect
choice
definitely
a
must
drink
refreshing
beer
would
like
to
see
the
creaminess
go
away
this
beer
is
just
another
reason
why
i
have
become
a
big
fan
of
ayinger
this
poured
a
nice
amber
with
a
big
fat
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
with
great
lacing
i
noticed
the
sweet
caramel
scent
right
away
great
maltiness
and
spice
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
was
packed
with
sweetness
that
was
kept
in
check
with
a
citrus
taste
and
some
hopiness
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
with
great
coating
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
was
much
enjoyed
d
smooth
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
copperbrown
with
a
twofinger
head
with
some
lacing
the
smell
is
some
toasty
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bread
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
caramel
that
gives
away
to
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
hop
spiciness
not
the
most
complex
version
of
the
style
but
a
damn
tasty
one
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
crisp
thanks
to
some
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
definitely
think
of
picking
up
again
sometime
mediumbodied
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
smooth
and
an
all
around
easy
drinker
nice
and
refreshing
i
dont
need
a
whole
case
of
these
but
id
probably
go
ahead
and
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
next
year
the
body
is
just
slightly
thickened
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
this
beer
to
me
is
the
definition
of
a
seasonal
quaffer
very
nice
poured
an
attractive
copper
color
with
nice
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
aroma
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
sweetness
being
offset
by
just
a
bit
of

makes
me
want
some

d
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
because
of
the
light
flavors
and
thin
body
overall
just
an
ok
oktoberfest
beer
medium
bodied
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
soft
dryness
as
described
from

absolutely
wonderful
brew
thank
the
lord
for
the
hop
harvest
drinkability

very

out

500ml

sc
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
ambercopper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
slight
aromas
of
biscuity
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
of
biscuity
malt
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
a
decent
oktoberfest
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
it
gets
points
for
that
as
that
is
right
on
for
the
style
really
nothing
that
spectacular
though
a
good
solid
beer
but
noting
that
special
in
the
end
the
aroma
has
mild
floral
hops
and
caramel
malt
the
appearance
is
redcopper
with
a
foamy
head
that
turned
a
little
clumpy
the
flavor
is
very
malty
and
has
plenty
of
caramel
and
some
honey
its
a
simple
taste
but
good
the
palate
is
just
right
for
the
style
very
nice
and
true
to
the
style
but
it
did
have
a
couple
of
issues
for
one
it
did
taste
a
little
stale
d
a
betterthanaverage
marzen
but
there
are
others
than
are
more
enjoyable
and
a
better
value
this
is
a
great
ofest
rich
with
bready
caramel
malts
with
a
smooth
ohso
drinkable
body
it
is
a
touch
thicker
than
other
in
the
style
spaten
comes
to
mind
as
a
thinner
beer
but
man
its
good
the
flavor
has
subtle
layers
of
malt
with
a
touch
of
crisp
light
toffee
with
an
aroma
to
match
ill
be
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
next
fall
this
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
orangegold
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
smell
is
slight
herbal
and
grainy
taste
is
biscuity
slightly
fruity
with
a
big
herbal
hop
finish
very
nice
high
bitterness
that
matches
up
with
the
malt
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
slightly
light
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
marzen
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
again
serving
type
bottle
im
just
not
sure
i
enjoy
the
oktoberfest
type
of
beer
as
much
as
id
like
to
if
i
did
then
i
would
be
almost
sure
that
ayinger
would
do
it
justice
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
frothing
rocky
head
aroma
is
grainy
malts
flavor
kind
of
matches
that
as
well
there
are
some
great
malts
in
this
one
but
it
seems
like
it
is
a
bit
too
raw
slight
note
of
german
hops
after
the
swallow
pours
an
amber
color
body
some
orange
whitish
head
small
and
diminishing
malty
sweet
aroma
fruity
but
not
very
strong
fruity
flowery
and
malty
taste
some
light
fruity
malty
taste
not
too
bad
kinda
tasty
could
spend
all
day
drinking
this
pint
after
pint
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
among
ayingers
better
efforts
in
my
opinion
a
bit
more
body
than
most
german
marzen
offerings
and
a
bit
less
that
the
maltier
american
versions
definitely
drinkable
if
not
the
best
german
oktoberfest
could
i
drink
down
several
of
these
yes
of
course
but
would
i
want
to
thats
the
real
question
and
im
afraid
the
answer
is
bordering
on
no
d
a
nice
okto
a
well
done
representative
of
the
style
drinkability
easy
to
drink
which
ive
found
is
common
in
alot
of
german
marzens
i
can
def
session
these
easily
a
good
stab
at
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
good
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
liked
several
others
more
than
this
one
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
was
appropriate
for
the
style
but
the
taste
could
have
used
a
bit
more
work
as
it
seemed
a
little
too
sweet
fairly
good
drinkability
overall
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
while
not
the
best
of
its
style
its
still
a
highly
likable
brew
d
a
nice
oktboerfestmarzan
beer
i
would
def
have
another
and
i
recommend
a
sixer
decided
to
try
this
back
to
back
against
paulaners
okto
pours
with
almost
no
head
and
whats
there
is
gone
in
an
instant
doesnt
lace
at
all
either
pleasing
color
though
a
clear
cider
gold
smells
sweet
bread
apple
and
plum
taste
is
less
pronounced
than
paulaner
but
very
similar
sweet
fruitlike
malt
tempered
by
a
dash
of
noble
hops
nothing
unpleasant
but
flavors
lack
the
clarity
of
the
pauly
okto
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
strongpoint
not
thick
not
thin
just
right
goldilocks
would
approve
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
be
sure
but
i
wouldnt
choose
this
over
the
paulaner
more
beer
and
sauerbraten
prost
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
deep
ellum
the
night
after
i
tasted
28
oktoberfests
this
one
hit
the
spot
a
beautiful
oktoberfest
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
2
fingered
white
head
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
big
on
toasted
malts
with
a
wonderful
cramy
mouthfeel
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
it
could
be
the
best
oktoberfest
out
on
the
market
well
carbonated
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
clean
tasting
and
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
at
oktoberfest
in
germany
with
their
traditional
food
some
day
d
very
drinkable
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
the
usually
oktoberfestlager
smell
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
colour
of
the
beer
is
a
light
copper
colour
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
is
about
one
inch
and
has
pretty
good
retention
the
beer
could
be
slightly
more
dark
the
beer
has
an
initial
bite
from
the
lagering
then
continues
through
some
sweetness
and
some
biscuit
flavours
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
something
roasted
as
well
that
brings
a
nice
balance
to
everything
in
the
beer
the
beer
is
really
damn
good
and
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
it
works
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
its
creamy
and
crisp
pretty
drinkable
beer
like
pretty
much
all
oktoberfests
i
would
recommend
this
oktoberfestmarzen
to
anyone
who
is
longing
for
a
classic
german
munich
oktoberfest
marzen
this
beer
offers
excellent
drinkability
great
alcohol
balance
to
coincide
with
the
flavor
offerings
something
i
could
drink
all
night
on
a
nice
autumn
eve
ning
drinkability
this
is
the
most
refreshing
octoberfest
beer
ive
had
this
year
this
is
the
ideal
beer
to
drink
on
a
warm
autumn
day
espcially
while
sitting
back
and
relaxing
this
is
also
a
great
session
beer
and
perfect
for
enjoying
while
watching
a
football
game
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
your
hands
on
this
fine
marzen
it
will
make
you
appreciate
the
month
of
october
even
more

taste
with
a
fleeting
metallic
aftertaste
at
first
fairly
clean
drinking
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
by
a
long
shot
but
its
not
bad
well
other
than
that
aftertaste
i
think
i
must
have
had
a
bad
bottle
or
an
old
bottle
a
nice
beer
indeed
ill
definitely
have
again
and
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
maltier
ofest
but
still
pretty
light
and
easy
drinking
not
the
most
complex
perhaps
a
bit
dumb
downed
but
at
least
it
looks
like
it
should

aroma
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
husky
grass
decent
body
as
it
streams
across
the
palate
the
flavors
seem
very
raw
grain
crackers
and
a
little
caramel
sweetness
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
pours
translucent
amber
not
completely
transparent
like
most
festbiers
head
is
white
and
full
good
lacing
as
well

is

with
roasty
malts
taste
is
full
and
rich
good
balance
of

and

refreshing
but
not
too
thin
pours
a
vibrat
clear
yellow
pine
color
with
a
creamy
puffy
white
head
smells
so
sweet
bready
some
brown
sugar
red
apples
some
floral

in
the
background
wonderful
taste
begins
with
a
very
nice
white
bread
toasted
short
bread
white
grapes
and
a
bright
red
apple
sweetness
with
a
crisp
refreshing
citrusy
finish
incredibly
drinkable
leaves
you
yerning
for
more
best
of
the
season
so
far
very
drinkable
no
shame
or
risk
in
offering
this
choice
to
an
oktoberfest
newcomer
the
ayinger
fest
offering
pours
a
perfect
warming
orange
brown
color
with
a
beautiful
creamy
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
lots
of
clean
toasty
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
subtle
nutty
character
while
tasting
lots
of
crisp
smokey
malts
biscuit
tones
and
a
good
citrusy
hop
twang
and
spice
lingering
towards
the
finish
the
bitter
hops
meld
with
the
smokey
malts
into
the
after
taste
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
oktoberfest
biers
are
all
about
its
zesty
lively
easily
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
poured
light
brown
in
color
i
had
a
hard
pour
and
i
think
it
paid
off
decent
head
that
lasted
head
was
off
white
in
color
had
some
decent
lacing
smelled
of
malt
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
caramel
tasted
ever
so
lightly
sweet
with
caramel
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
reminded
me
of
a
light
dark
beer
felt
good
in
the
mouth
probably
a
little
on
the
light
side
carbonation
was
good
if
you
was
at
a
party
and
wanted
to
use
this
as
a
session
beer
you
would
of
made
a
good
choice
i
think
it
would
be
good
outside
at
a
campfire
with
a
light
jacket
on
and
enjoying
a
october
evening
pours
clear
bright
amber
almost
sparkling
with
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
made
up
of
tiny
uniform
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
kind
of
quickly
but
stays
around
nonetheless
and
leaves
a
decent
lace
smells
malty
and
maybe
a
little
nutty
tastes
clean
and
a
little
light
with
nice
malt
base
and
a
lightly
hopped
aftertaste
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
medium
body
and
active
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
solid
octoberfest
offering
from
germany
and
worth
a
try
d
really
drinkable
im
enjoying
this
one
while
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
from
the
abundant
malt
profile
this
drinks
very
easily
a
good
ol
standby
for
fest
season
an
amazingly
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
tried
yet
the
halfliter
just
wasnt
enough
ayingers
take
on
the
style
is
extremely
distinct
and
most
definitely
rivals
spatens
original
ayingers
marzen
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
along
with
bells
seasonal
offering
taste
mouthfeel
incredibly
crisp
while
still
maintaining
a
light
malty
sweetness
this
is
what
marzens
are
all
about
peaches
and
honey
come
to
mind
here
appropriately
light
bodied
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
flowery
hops
ive
got
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
simply
great
stuff
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
mfd
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
goes
down
easily
with
plenty
of
flavor
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
d
leave
it
to
the
germans
to
make
a
great
oktober
festmarzen
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
an
exception
octoberfest
for
sure
highly
drinkable
a
reddishorange
pour
results
in
a
twofinger
thick
and
rolling
tan
head
retention
is
excellent
and
a
slight
but
consistent
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
some
spice
an
undercurrent
of
fruit
is
present
but
almost
goes
unnoticed
tastes
spicy
and
malty
with
some
hoppy
balance
in
the
end
very
tasty
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
this
ones
fairly
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
excellent
with
the
tastiness
in
no
way
limiting
its
smoothness
going
down
the
gullet
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
so
far
d
smooth
as
a
marzen
can
be
tasty
refreshing
and
tremendous
alongside
virtually
any
cuisine
i
would
imagine
we
have
a
winner
here
the
taste
and
aftertaste
lets
you
know
what
so
many
others
are
missing
in
their
effort
on
this
style
mdagain
a
little
too
much
pine
for
this
lumberjack
other
than
that
no
complaints
carbonation
was
spot
on
and
it
had
an
easy
creaminess
that
smoothed
the
ride
out
amid
the
tongueparching
if
i
liked
hops
a
lot
more
id
order
plenty
of
this
rather
than
the
paulaner
which
so
far
is
my
favorite
in
this
style
d
the
drinkability
is
over
the
top
a
smooth
drinker
with
a
warming
of
flavors
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
a
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
pour
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
smelled
of
malts
and
spices
it
was
a
very
thin
beer
almost
no
body
to
it
but
very
easy
to
drink
tasted
of
average
malts
with
a
faint
hint
or
caramel
not
to
much
going
on
with
the
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
compare
to
some
other
oktoberfestmarzens
i
still
say
try
it
nice
ofest
from
ayinger
not
the
best
of
zee
germans
ive
had
but
definitely
a
worthy
offering
pours
a
huge
twofinger
head
that
died
very
slowly
with
immense
lacings
on
top
of
an
orange
body
that
looked
beautiful
some
sweet
malts
caramel
mostly
ok
a
lot
of
caramel
like
a
liquid
caramello
bar
some
spices
also
in
there
medium
bodied
and
a
little
fluffy
this
beer
is
real
smooth
and
has
some
creamniess
to
it
still
complemented
with
a
hop

has

that
you

youre
not

its
not

easy
to
get

does
it
quite

with

brew
if
you
can
locate
this
one
its

worth
seeking
out
d
overall
a
great
oktoberfest
style
beer
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
more
of
these

at

taste
is
lots
of

theres
a
hint
of
nut
and
spice
in
the
flavor
very
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
this
one
will
be
gone
before
i
realize
it
drinkability
is
fairly
high
nice
flavors
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
nice
oktoberfest
session
it
also
destroys
most
of
its
american
counterparts
imo
d
drinkable
but
man
i
felt
like
i
just
ate
a
steak
dinner
after
drinking
this
beer
not

i
could

more
than

decent

i
was
expecting
more
coming
from
this
brewery
but
i
feel
like
i
was
somewhat
let
down
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
white

has
good
graininess
and
a
bit
of
clear
malt
taste
follows
a
solid
lagery
grain
taste
with
some
amped
up

presence
relatively
speaking
some
breadiness
in
here
as
well
a
touch
of
spice
a
nice
slight
euro
hop
nip
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
and
drinkability
is
very
solid

well
glad
to
see
these
hitting
the
shelves
again
as
oktoberfest
is
right
around
the
corner
d
smooth
and
refreshing
flavorful
at
fridge
temp
but
more
complex
a
little
warmer
ive
always
thought
this
style
wouldnt
suit
me
but
brau
von
aying
has
changed
my
mind
thanks
to
the
bier
depot
for
having
the
best
selection
of
german
beer
around
i
feel
like
putting
on
a
funny
hat
and
smashing
mugs
with
buddies
prost
taste
is
full
of
sweet
malt
as
is
expected
for
the
style
finish
is
bitter
from
the
hops
and
is
a
bit
dry
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
but
not
my
favorite
definitely
prefer
the
paulaner
as
far
as
the
germans
go
still
drinks
pretty
easy
though
d
easy
to
drink
i
just
think
there
are
better
examples
of
the

isnt

i
could
see
this
one
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
the
fall
quite
drinkable
traditional
oktoberfest
beer
looks
good
in
the
mug
and
drinks
as
this
beer
style
should
this
is
a
great
standard
for
an
oktoberfest
it
took
a
little
while
for
the
aroma
to
open
up
but
once
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
it
was
rewarding

the

takes
a
short
while
to
warm
up
and
release
all
of
its
potential
slightly
aggressive
and
nicely
sweet
there
is
a
good
bread
quality
present
tops
on
the
list
for
marzens
that
i
have
encountered
so
far
pours
a
dark

orange
with
a
frothy
white

that
sticks
around
the
smell
is
malty
with
yeasty

notes
and
some

characters
from
the

the
taste
is
huge
very
malty
a

with
some

characteristics
coming
through
the

is
decent
having
good
carbonation
a
consistent

with
a
medium

this
beers
large
flavor
makes
it
a
great
drinker
for
the
fans
and
a
hard
one
to
introduce
to
anyone
who
stays
away
from
the
oktoberfestmarzen
worth
checking
out
for
the
fans
of
the
style
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
anyway
if
you
want
a
fullerbodied
evenkeel
märzen
try
this
one
this
is
a
good
beer
across
the
board
but
not
exceptional
definately
worth
buying
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
gotta
love
ayinger
since
they
brew
this
seasonal
all
year
long
a
very
enjoyable
beer
which
i
will
pick
up
again
in
the
future
another
nice
offering
from
ayinger
d
great
malt
character
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
and
give
it
the
high
level
of
drinkability
that
characterizes
a
fest
bier
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
with
that
classic
german
lager
balance
and
drinkability
its
hard
to
believe
that
light
beer
like
a
festbier
would
age
nicely
but
i
think
that
sitting
a
few
months
may
have
helped
this
beer
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
wispy
head
of
small
white
bubbles
aroma
is
of
sweet
apricots
flowery
apricot
is
the
predominant
flavor
as
well
but
more
subtle
not
overwhelming
medium
body
leaves
a
bit
of
a
slick
syrup
sensation
in
the
aftertaste
mild
bitterness
in
the
flavoraftertaste
as
it
warms
good
but
on
the
expensive
side
for
what
it
is
d
could
drink
this
all
night
medium
alcohol
content
allows
having
a
few
and
still
being
able
to
stand
up
and
the
flavor
is
the
signature
of
german
brewing
feel
like
im
in
a
neighborhood
biergarten
and
pining
for
wursts
and
spaetzel
cloudy
amber
pour
with
an
offwhite

smell
of
honey

yeast
with
a

taste
mouthfeel

bubbly
and
somehow
almost
a
gritty
aftertaste
feel
something
distinct
about
the
taste
that
i
cant
place
not
bad
but
not
great

a
light

with
a
thick
off

from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
very
nice
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
also
a
nice
bready
malt
there
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
metallic
flavor
at
colder
temperatures
but
it
didnt
really
put
me
off
definitely
worth
a
try
i
may
remove
all
of
my
labels
from
now
on
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
very
basic
worth
trying
saved
the
best
for
last
here
as
far
as
my
opinion
and
i
will
admit
preference
are
concerned
after
trying
the
altbairisch
dunkel
urweisse
and
brauweisse
this
one
is
smoother
and
more
rounded
than
the
others
i
thought
with
an
even
sweet
smooth
tone
and
hints
of
grain
that
do
not
overpower
the
flavor
yet
again
though
nothing
overly
unique
or
interesting
just
another
smooth
fairly
well
made
brew
first
brew
i
had
from
ayinger
was
their
brauweisse
which
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
although
this
brew
lacks
the
flavor
of
the
hefe
it
is
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
with
an
amber
goldness
and
smooth
exceptional
taste
that
goes
down
clean
and
easily
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
bitter
at
all
with
citrusy
aftertones
and
a
bread
and
butter
flavor
that
wasnt
too
powerful
or
overbearing
a
great
sample
and
definitely
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
experience
very
sessionable
beer
tastes
like
a
poor

celebrator

not

i
will
drink
this
beer
again
and
purchase
again
as
well
the
only
thing
bad
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
super
foamy
drinkability
good
tasting
octoberfest
decided
to
get
one
from
the
source
and
it
was
a
good
pick
drinkability
a
great
beer
for
having
a
few
rounds
with
the
boys
touted
as
a
authentic
bavarian
festival
lager
its
a
striking
amber
colored
lager
with
a
light
carbonation
a
very
pleasant
soft
velvety
head
with
a
smooth
crisp
finish
satisfying
yet
keeps
you
wanting
more
with
such
a
great
body
and
tastefinish
i
could
drink
this
in
abundance
great
beer
revisit
october
2009
there
is
a
definite
caramelized
malty
sweetness
to
the
beer
a
touch
of
some
spice
and
almost
a
toffee
candied
flavor
in
the
taste
there
is
a
touch
of
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
consistency
but
just
a
touch
a
nice
marzen
but
im
getting
less
enamored
with
the
style
these
days
immanently
drinkable
so
light
crisp
and
it
glides
down
making
it
easily
quaffable
for
celebrating
i
really
like
the
level
of
spices
and
hops
although
the
malts
could
be
amped
up
as
it
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
the
depth
just
isnt
there
for
me
but
the
flavor
is
great
and
full
for
such
a
light
body
very
good
and
certainly
recommended
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
imo
i
had
this
festmarzen
from
the
bottle
its
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
large
white
head
that
settled
quickly
it
had
a
sweet
malty
smell
but
not
overpowering
its
taste
followed
the
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
behind
that
was
a
touch
of
spice
it
was
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
will
be
pouring
another
da
fine
oktoberfest
well
balanced
and
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
much
different
than
the
standard
american
oktoberfest
it
definately
has
an
authentic
character
and
is
better
for
it
it
wont
blow
your
doors
off
with
big
flavors
or
complexity
but
it
is
a
good
drinking
beer
on
tap
it
had
a
dark
orangelike
color
hoping
for
another
great
seasonal
drink
i
was
surprised
by
its
almost
sour
taste
it
still
had
the
oktoberish
spice
and
it
was
actually
a
pretty
light
beverage
but
the
sour
aftertaste
was
really
offputting
one
could
even
smell
the
slight
sour
scent
coming
from
this
beer
however
its
crisp
octoberspice
rescued
it
from
a
complete
disaster
the
sour
tastesmell
made
the
drink
just
a
bit
off

finish
and
a

in

very
nice
palate
just
rolls
over
the
tongue
but
is
not
in
the
least
boring
but
makes
for
a
drinkable
brew
indeed
drinkability
enjoyable
and
sessionable
but
fairly
middleoftheroad
will
definitely
try
again
just
no
big
hurry
overall
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
the
finish
on
this
beer
the
tartness
and
crispness
of
it
make
this
beer
a
real
treat
to
drink
very
good
beer
was
very
surprised
by
the
taste
would
buy
this
beer
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
am
very
curious
about
the
other
beers
that
ayinger
offers
and
how
they
compare
to
the
oktober
fest
marzen
received
this
beer
from
capitol
distributing
from
a
friend
who
works
there
d
nicely
balanced
marzen
that
seems
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
traditional
octoberfest
style
very
easytodrink
with
a
robust
taste
profile
this
is
an
understated
seasonal
style
and
i
would
definitely
pick
up
ayingers
version
again
whenever
the
mood
or
month
hits
me
i
have
come
to
the
last
of
my
oktoberfest
selections
that
i
purchased
tis
a
sad
day
and
will
have
to
go
pick
up
some
more
if
i
can
ever
seem
to
get
myself
out
to
the
store
so
this
one
i
saved
for
last
poured
a
nice
orange
tinted
light
amber
with
a
good
two
inches
or
more
of
head
strewn
across
the
top
a
nice
slow
fade
left
behind
more
then
an
adequate
layer
of
lace
across
the
top
and
some
very
nice
side
glass
lace
when
it
was
done
smell
was
very
nice
quite
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
grain
backing
and
a
nice
light
earthy
sort
of
hop
tone
definitely
some
spices
mixed
in
as
there
was
just
that
little
extra
kick
to
it
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
on
point
with
the
aroma
a
tight
mix
of
grain
and
earthy
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
maybe
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
something
fairly
nice
and
had
a
good
overall
fall
feel
to
it
very
nice
light
body
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
made
it
go
down
super
smooth
and
kept
it
from
feeling
too
filling
overall
this
was
definitely
a
quality
selection
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
superb
drinkability
and
just
a
great
overall
profile
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
if
i
can
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
season
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
oktoberfest
a
little
too
thin
at
times
i
looked
for
more
complexity
but
the
fruitiness
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
wish
i
had
one
of
those
trees
pictured
on
the
cap
that
has
ayinger
bottles
growing
all
over
it
thats
for
true
not
a
bad
beer
on
sale
at
bevmo
d
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
true
bavarian
marzen
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
this
maybe
bottle
form
is
not
the
way
to
go
with
this
beer
ayinger
will
be
at
the
brewers
jam
in
knoxville
tomorrow
so
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
review
a
tap
version
of
this
beer
there
pours
a
very
pretty
copper
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
barely
laces
at
all
before
i
can
even
get
my
nose
to
the
glass
i
smell
delicious
biscuity
malt
when
i
get
a
better
whiff
i
cant
smell
anything
besides
malt
no
hop
or
yeast
scent
at
all
tastes
much
like
it
smells
very
malty
but
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
its
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
good
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
nice
equal
levels
of
flavors
and
auroma
this
is
definatly
a
well
rounded
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
subtle
malt
complexity
flavor
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
for
my
taste
but
certainly
a
great
session
brew
a
well
crafted
seasonal
d
this
is
a
marzen
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
also
one
that
rests
on
balance
seeing
as
how
i
tried
it
the
first
weekend
of
oktoberfest
this
is
great
beer
to
kick
off
the
festival
and
with
fall
rolling
in
this
seems
like
a
beer
id
return
as
the
nights
get
colder
a
nice
easy
to
drink
marzen
it
was
more
about
mouthfeel
than
taste
especially
the
dry
quality
i
do
enjoy
beers
like
that
but
wish
it
had
some
more
oomph
depth
it
would
be
nice
to
enjoy
this
with
simple
fare
especially
german
food
andor
either
a
nice
dry
cheddar
as
a
compliment
or
a
creamy
smooth
bleu
as
a
contradiction
id
drink
it
again
especially
with
the
aforementioned
but
would
also
try
other
new
ones
if
given
the
option
certainly
worthy
of
trying
my
second
in
a
night
of
the
ayingers
i
really
love
a
good
marzen
lets
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
pours
a
light
copperish
color
seems
lighter
than
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
before
i
get
butterscotch
when
i
take
a
whiff
malty
sweet
kinda
syrupy
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
a
bit
of
smokiness
good
but
i
prefer
paulaner
when
it
comes
to
this
style
yet
still
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
one
drinkability
easily
quaffable
and
sweet
enough
to
enjoy
quaffing
but
not
so
interesting
as
to
warrant
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkabilitythis
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
and
the
6
alc
one
could
drink
these
all
night
or
all
day
d
a
very
good
beer
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
great
example
of
a
marzen
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
made
me
want
some
german
food
to
go
with
it
poured
a
light
but
rich
golden
with
a
light
shade
of
orange
the
smell
has
a
sugary
sweet
quality
to
it
that
i
cant
describe
but
i
also
thought
i
got
some
sort
of
corn
or
off
smell
from
it
the
taste
has
the
sweet
maltiness
you
expect
and
mayyybe
a
little
toastiness
but
you
mostly
get
a
sweetness
from
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
i
thought
it
was
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
even
though
it
is
a
lager
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
though
not
ahead
of
some
others
such
as
spaten
or
sam
adams
this
is
a
very
polished
beer
and
by
far
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
oddly
enough
a
lot
of
people
reviewed
the
beer
as
being
sweet
in
taste
and
im
getting
more
of
the
bready
maltyness
and
no
real
sweetness
take
it
for
its
worth
i
guess
light
malts
dominate
the
nose
a
crisp
and
clean
essence
is
left
behind
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
without
any
of
the
spiciness
american
versions
are
known
for
there
is
a
slight
caramel
hue
and
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
to
be
blunt
it
is
simple
yet
refined
a
great
marzen
without
much
fanfare
wow
definitely
the
best
märzen
ive
had
yet
ill
be
seeking
this
out
for
the
rest
of
this
autumn
and
autumns
to
come
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
very
nice
amber
color
and
it
had
a
very
nice
bubbly
head
with
great
lacing
qualities
the
beer
had
a
weird
smell
that
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
not
really
pleasant
either
it
did
have
a
slighly
nutty
flavour
and
a
nice
malty
finish
i
will
buy
again
are
pretty
much
a
sure
thing
and
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
a
very
tasty
and
robust
beer
the
finish
was
a
bit
uncomfortable
and
only
hope
that
it
was
a
slightly
old
sample
pours
a
golden
amber
thin
white
headwith
lots
of
retentionand
really
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
maltsand
bread
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbionation
taste
is
of
maltand
breadand
fruit
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
very
nice
solid
effort
and
a
very
tasty
brew
might
not
be
my
favorite
märzen
but
its
right
up
there
a
classic
german
fest
lager
my
first
one
of
the
season
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
good
choice
prost
my
first
stop
on
this
years
tour
of
octoberfests
this
brew
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
nice
white
fizzy
head
that
stays
around
smell
is
very
dry
and
mostly
bready
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
taste
is
smooth
and
semisweet
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
taste
of
candied
fruit
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
there
to
balance
it
finishes
very
smooth
and
refreshing
all
in
all
a
solid
octoberfest
but
there
are
better
out
there
the
beer
pours
a
rich
darkish
gold
color
with
very
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
looks
very
impressive
i
dont
get
too
much
on
the
nose
just
some
sweet
grain
and
malt
however
it
does
smell
very
enticing
the
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
and
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
plenty
of
sweet
malty
flavor
in
this
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
long
persistent
finish
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
so
drinkable
its
a
pleasure
to
find
it
on
tap
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
ive
come
across
on
tap
so
far
this
year
d
this
beer
has
light
flavor
with
some
depth
but
not
much
the
flavor
was
ok
but
i
just
got
tired
of
drinking
it
about
half
way
through
the
glass
very
drinkable
it
is
not
watered
down
so
flavor
abounds
but
remains
very
smooth
and
doesnt
weigh
you
down
get
a
couple
of
these
to
fill
your
oktoberfest
mug
on
an
autumn
afternoon
and
kick
back
and
watch
the
badgers
dominate
another
big
ten
opponent
this
is
a
classic
beer
for
the
style
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
huge
recommendation
from
me
get
your
drinking
in
now
since
it
aint
available
year
round
just
a
little
lighter
than
amber
like
amber
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
pretty
well
and
leaves
some
lace
smells
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
like
an
oktoberfest
should
caramel
toffee
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
some
citrus
flower
apple
hop
i
would
have
liked
the
aroma
to
come
through
a
little
more
but
still
nice
and
above
average
well
blended
taste
with
a
sweet
choco
toffee
hoppy
character
the
hops
come
through
and
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
roasty
or
sweet
as
some
others
ive
tried
this
year
and
i
like
that
very
refreshing
body
could
be
a
little
fuller
but
i
think
its
a
nice
halfway
between
light
and
medium
ill
have
another
d
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
ayinger
makes
really
good
stuff
i
find
all
of
their
beers
to
be
at
least
above
average
in
the
style
one
of
my
favourite
german
breweries
another
good
job
d
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
oktoberfest
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
one
and
nothing
to
surprising
im
always
a
fan
of
the
festbiers
when
they
come
out
and
the
ayinger
is
another
good
one
to
add
to
the
list
its
a
little
spicier
than
some
of
ther
others
although
not
as
spicy
as
harpoon
and
perhaps
a
little
fruitier
than
most
but
the
richness
of
the
malts
and
the
dry
light
hop
finish
make
this
an
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
beer
drinks
too
easy
finally
a
bottle
that
matches
up
with
what
i
had
in
germany
recommended
right
hereright
now
pours
a
copper
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
and
spice
in
the
taste
earthy
and
a
spice
that
is
in
the
end
not
bitter
very
smooth
and
somewhat
refreshing
a
dry
sweet
end
this
was
the
beer
that
made
me
understand
oktoberfests
pils
lagers
a
great
fall
beer
a
descent
offering
like
any
in
style
this
works
good
with
a
plate
of
german
sausage
solid
offering
i
would
drink
if
it
was
available
try
it
in
a
side
by
side
to
see
subtle
differences
it
is
a
rich
dark
honey
color
with
a
lightburnt
taste
and
aroma
it
is
better
warmer
more
malt
aromaflavor
which
gives
it
a
great
hop
aroma
very
nice
brussels
lace
i
loved
it
with
the
chocolate
chip
cookies
light
to
no
head
on
style
with
a
marzen
ayinger
is
a
pretty
reliable
brewer
for
me
poured
into
a
ayinger
glass
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
offwhite
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hops
slight
citrus
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
hoppy
slightly
citrus
slightly
yeasty
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
another
awesome
brew
from
ayinger
d
i
would
most
definetly
be
back
to
drink
this
one
again
its
an
alright
oktoberfest
beer
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
theres
certainly
better
ones
out
there
poured
from
a
1
pt
bottle
into
a
mug
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
bread
nuts
and
spices
are
on
the
nose
with
a
malty
taste
on
the
tongue
a
nice
warmth
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
a
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
good
choice
clean
and
somewhat
crisp
on
the
palate
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
was
low
but
it
seemed
to
be
a
detriment
here
ill
admit
i
bought
it
for
the
cap
since
this
is
not
a
huge
monster
beer
my
score
will
seem
high
to
most
but
here
goes
this
poured
a
beautiful
rocky
head
with
durable
thick
lacing
to
match
and
was
a
nice
clear
amber
in
color
nothing
overpowering
in
the
nosevery
subtle
but
great
malt
aromas
fresh
bread
dough
caramel
nuts
in
the
bouquet
taste
matched
the
aroma
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
to
use
and
play
up
malts
without
needing
to
be
a
huge
bodied
beer
ayinger
really
knows
how
to
showcase
great
clean
malt
flavor
hop
aromas
are
almost
undetectable
however
there
is
just
enough
amount
of
background
bitterness
in
this
to
counter
the
moderate
malt
sweetness
it
finished
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
crispness
for
balance
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
very
sessionable
due
to
its
abv
mouthfeel
and
finish
i
only
wish
it
were
available
in
6ers
or
minikegs
good
solid
texture
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
body
easily
drinkable
if
youre
into
the
style
although
one
is
plenty
for
me
got
a
good
deal
on
all
their
last
2006
bottles
so
i
guess
it
will
be
a
pretensious
session
beer
for
me
in
a
few
weekends
drinkability
not
nearly
as
moving
or
stirring
as
some
other
oktoberfests
available
classic
german
taste
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
always
command
respect
pass
the
gouda
overall
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
better
than
i
was
expecting
wound
up
drinking
half
a
glass
and
sadly
poured
out
the
rest
purchased
two
bottles
though
and
will
update
this
review
if
the
other
turns
out
better
d
quite
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
excellent
representation
of
style
i
polished
off
the
bottle
i
had
extremely
quickly
and
can
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
the
beer
had
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
that
hardly
moved
the
body
was
was
a
hazy
goldenamber
with
huge
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
nose
was
filled
with
a
strong
fruity
honey
bread
aroma
which
was
a
little
sharp
the
taste
had
a
very
roasted
for
an
ofest
thick
flavor
like
heavy
bread
with
light
dosing
of
citrus
the
mouth
was
fairly
thick
too
much
so
with
soft
carbonation
despite
the
appearance
this
beer
made
me
grimace
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
so
ill
try
to
check
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
chewiness
tangy
and
refreshing
to
drink
salud
i
want
to
like
the
various
beer
from
ayinger
but
time
and
again
they
tend
to
underwhelm
everything
is
done
right
i
just
dont
get
excited
about
it
the
exception
to
the
rule
is
their
mighty
celebrator
which
i
find
to
be
one
of
the
finest
beers
ever
made
but
that
is
a
different
entry
which
leads
me
to
their
oktober
festmarzen
there
is
nothing
special
here
it
is
a
less
than
interesting
octoberfest
yet
it
is
fairly
refreshing
and
only
slightly
sweet
with
mild
bitterness
carbonation
is
low
with
virtually
no
head
and
has
an
almost
oily
finish
to
the
mouth
for
that
reason
alone
it
is
very
drinkable
but
also
lacks
any
zing
however
it
does
have
a
decent
fruity
malty
aroma
and
appropriate
deep
golden
color
for
the
style
once
again
they
did
what
was
expected
to
make
this
beer
properly
and
that
is
about
it
would
i
drink
it
again
of
course
i
just
wouldnt
be
excited
about
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
light
enough
to
not
fatigue
the
palate
should
be
very
drinkable
except
for
the
touch
of
astingence
which
slows
me
down
overall
a
very
fine
oktoberfest
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
drinkability
highly
sessionable
i
do
sense
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
near
the
finish
but
the
finish
itself
is
quite
malty
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
but
there
are
others
that
i
prefer
drinkability
this
isnt
the
best
ofest
ive
ever
tasted
but
it
is
definitely
as
quaffable
as
beers

with
a
one
inch
creamy
colored

forming
at

the
strong
scent
of

is
very
dominant
in
the
flavor
with
touch

there
is
a
undrinkable

i
have
not
found
it
yet
a
good
solid
octoberfest
beer
i
think
i
will
drink
the
other
two
i
have
right
now
a
very
drinkable
marzen
that
i
highley
recommend
drinkability
the
oktoberfest
i
would
order
in
germany
well
maybe
not
when
in
munich
i
have
really
gotten
to
enjoy
some
previously
unavailable
marzensthis
one
included
locally
this
fall
and
im
pumped
about
it
alas
autumn
is
but
once
a
year
a
medium
copper
amber
with
moderate
carbonation
s
malted
slightly
sugary
sweetness
with
a
fair
presence
of
fruityyeastiness
t
malts
that
are
sweetened
with
sourwood
honey
and
maybe
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
m
medium
bodied
with
enough
heft
to
bring
the
flavors
of
the
beer
through
d
very
quaffable
and
smooth
light
enough
to
repeat
but
flavorful
enough
to
satisfy

good

for

assuming
from
the
good
reviews
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
beer
i
was
excited
about
it
but
let
down
immensely
i
will
try
to
give
it
another
chance
ayinger
poured
just
a

more
golden
less
brown
and
a
little
cloudy
compared
to
the
other
two
smell
was
bready
with
a
hint
of
toffee
or
sweetness
the
taste
was
buttery
malty
sweet
with
a
little
spice
or
yeast
and
lots
of
apple
fruitiest
of
the
fests
also
the
lightest
in
flavor
and
body
which
made
it
quite
drinkable
drinkability
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
but
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
palate
overall
a
very
graceful
and
perfectly
balanced
ofest
the
key
here
is
freshness
i
believe
this
was
the
freshest
beststored
german
import
ive
ever
tasted
im
so
glad
it
was
from
this
brewery
simply
the
finest
representation
of
the
style
ive
ever
put
to
my
lips
i
cannot
find
one
thing
wrong
with
this
lager
superb
in
every
facet
pours
to
an
orangeamber
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lacing
it
smells
of
a
caramel
malt
banana
with
a
slight
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
starts
caramel
with
fruitiness
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
taste
on
the
end
it
has
just
enough
hops
at
the
end
to
offset
the
sweetness
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
lots
of
creamy
suds
to
explore
those
taste
buds
i
could
see
my
self
drinking
a
large
quantity
of
this
while
scarfing
down
some
brats
and
kraut
mmm
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
octoberfestmarzen
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
this
is
easily
my
favorite
so
far
based
on
this
version
from
ayinger
i
may
have
to
dig
a
little
deeper
into
the
style
oelergud
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
thing
one
especially
since
i
usually
find
quality
from
ayinger
it
just
seemed
too
watery
and
flavorless
although
it
did
have
the
sweet
taste
of
a
typical
oktoberfest
beer
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
drink
it
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
personal
favorite
oktoberfest
would
be
happy
to
buydrink
again
well
now
this
was
quite
a
treat
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
and
maybe
ever
this
will
certainly
become
my
goto
when
i
thirst
for
marzen
impeccable
mouthfeel
just
so
gentle
drinkability
is
beyond
a
five
as
glasses
even
big
ones
just
disappear
magic
beer
d
ayinger
is
becoming
my
german
brewer
of
choice
with
brews
like
this
very
nice
brew
the
bottle
version
of
this
seems
more
raw
but
just
as
good
drinkability
a
simply
good
beer
and
rather
sessionable
its
supposed
to
be
a
celebration
bitches
this
beer
pours
a
rusty
amber
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
holds
nicely
until
there
is
a
little
film
left
without
much
lacing
the
beer
smells
sweetly
with
lightly
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
and
again
hits
with
toasted
malts
there
is
the
faintest
taste
of
hops
that
balances
the
sweetness
with
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
body
wiht
a
good
carbonation
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
oktoberfest
d
this
is
my
first
oktoberfest
that
ive
drunk
with
a
critical
mind
its
quite
good
but
that
should
be
expected
from
a
great
brewery
such
as
ayinger
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
hugely
sweet
malt
presence
caramel
ripe
fruit
and
toffee
dominate
the
landscape
on
this
one
slightly
syrupy
finish
this
is
very
clean
and
easygoing
aroma
jumps
out
at
you
very
strong
carmel
reminds
me
of
molasses
somewhat
translucent
orange
body
with
several
fingers
worth
of
head
very
full
body
malt
and
carmel
dominate
the
flavor
some
roasty
presence
some
hops
there
but
this
is
definitely
a
maltforward
beer
unfortunately
theres
just
a
hint
of
that
roasted
vegetable
taste
in
it
i
think
goes
away
as
you
drink
it
not
the
best
octoberfest
ive
had
as
a
result
of
the
slight
offflavor
as
well
as
the
flavor
not
being
as
full
as
it
could
but
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
wish
i
could
find
it
on
tap
since
ive
heard
its
exquisite
that
way
fantastic
in
a
word
it
must
have
been
a
particularly
fresh
bottle
as
ive
read
many
of
the
reviews
here
and
i
was
far
better
than
i
had
expected
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
nice
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
that
lasted
well
into
the
first
third
of
consumption
rich
carmel
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
in
the
nose
and
taste
to
match
others
with
me
who
tasted
it
all
used
the
word
smooth
extremely
drinkable
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
in
this
sample
anyway
not
too
sweet
and
no
distinct
alcohol
taste
the
hops
left
just
enough
fruity
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
to
encourage
me
to
lift
the
glass
again
and
again
i
was
glad
it
came
in
a
5l
bottle
it
disappeared
very
quickly
an
absolutely
wonderful
taste
of
oktoberfeststraight
from
germany
and
brewed
as
you
would
expect
in
strict
accordance
with
the
reinheitsgebot
a
real
winner
pours
out
a
nice
honey
gold
crowned
with
a
thin
white
hed
the
nose
gives
off
some
soy
and
orange
very
straightforward
taste
a
pleasing
light
malt
flavor
slightly
bready
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasent
clean
finish
nothing
great
about
this
beer
but
its
a
good
session
beer
that
can
go
all
night
long
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
might
very
well
do
so
tonight
this
is
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
in
my
mind
its
what
i
think
is
like
a
cross
between
a
bock
and
a
nut
brown
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
its
a
good
offering
from
ayinger
the
mouth
is
light
and
not
very
complex
quite
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
dry
malty
finish
very
drinkable
yet
not
all
that
exciting
seems
to
lack
personality
and
depth
of
flavor
drinkability
easy
to
drink
a
good
flavorful
brew
that
is
not
overwhelming
what
is
better
than
a
marzen
once
the
air
starts
to
turn
cold
i
think
today
is
the
first
day
of
fall
too
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
clear
dark
yellow
color
with
a
red
tint
the
smell
is
exceedingly
malty
so
much
so
that
you
can
almost
feel
the
thick
consistancy
the
taste
is
good
but
the
best
part
is
the
small
amount
of
carbonation
that
seems
to
let
the
beer
dance
on
your
tongue
before
taking
it
all
down
there
is
also
a
tart
taste
to
it
much
like
other
octoberfest
beers
that
ive
had
a
good
beer
overall
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
good
beer
that
should
be
tried
each
fall
cheers

of
my
favorite
styles

but
is
growing
on
me
gets
a
3
5
on
drinkability
for
now
but
could
go
up
in

definitely
worth
a
shot

two
each

body
is
on
the

side
making
it
highly
quaffable
and
enjoyable
simple
and
tastey
nothing
wrong
with
that
its
malty
for
an
ofest
but
not
at
all
overly
so
it
still
finishes
nice
and
dry
and
the
hops
contribute
some
spice
after
it
warms
a
bit
i
get
some
alcohol
warmth
and
a
little
more
mouthfeel
this
is
a
tasty
malty
märzen
thats
great
to
drink

color
topped
by
a
small
starkwhite
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
aroma
of
toasted
caramel
malt
lightly
fruity
hops
and
more
than
a
little
sourness
and
diacetyl
palate
seems
a
bit
off
lightly
sweet
malt
is
overshadowed
by
more
sourness
before
the
swallow
but
finishes
with
a
nice
and
mellow
maltiness
that
somewhat
redeems
it
body
is
nicely
smooth
great
for
a
marzen
if
not
for
the
sourness
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
this
would
be
an
excellent
marzen
this
is
a
well
balanced
quite
drinkable
beer
it
has
the
typical
german
malt
characteristics
and
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
imports
ive
had
a
great
representation
of
the
oktoberfestmarzen
style
worth
seeking
out
prost
when
this
is
fresh
it
is
so
flavorful
and
power
packed
this
is
not
only
worth
a
try
it
is
a
must
tryjust
as
much
as
sweet
corn
at
hearvest
or
a
purple
red
tomato
from
the
garden
overall
a
lovely
octoberfest
very
highly
recommended
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable

exceptional

the
best

it

is
also
a

as
well
as
some
dried
fruit
flavors

fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tounge
a
nice
marzen
and
perfent
for
the
season
overall
a
nicely
done
oktoberfest
a
perfect
match
for
the
cooling
temperatures
poured
a
golden
amber
hue
covered
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
which
is
fading
quickly
but
is
leaving
small
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass

mainly
of
cracked
grains
the
taste
is
a
crisp
slightly
fruitysweet
malt
flavor
rounded
out
with
mild
nutty
caramel
notes
its
very
light
mouthfeel
and
relatively
low
abv
make
this
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
very
easy
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
great
seasonal
perfect
beer
for
the
fall
recommended
this
beer
is
simply
outstanding
nothing
to
complain
about
nice
pillowy
head
has
a
slight
caramel
flavor
to
it
and
a
slight
fruity
twinge
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
fairly
priced
and
dozens
can
be
consumed
in
one
sitting
paulaner
being
my
favorite
festbier
has
found
its
match
if
this
was
flowing
freely
i
could
drink
this
insession
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
darkerthanale
beer
it
would
be
great
with
fests
with
foods
especially
with
beef
or
wildgame
meals
overall
a
decent
tasting
marzen
but
very
uneventful
needs
to
boost
the
flavor
up
a
notch
d
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
gorgeous
pour
with

is
big
and
wellrounded
with

carbonation
very
drinkable
rich
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
but
not
so
filling
that
you
couldnt
polish
off
many
glasses
of
this
stuff
great
oktoberfest
beer
a
solid
oktober
and
very
exemplary
of
the
style
md
well
balanced
sweet
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
with
a
spicy
carbonated
kick
and
a
great
aftertaste
a
well
crafted
brew
in
fairness
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
agiain
this
fall
i
drank
this
oktoberfest
beer
in
may
and
it
possibly
just
outlived
its
life
as
for
this
one
it
had
a
nice
copper
color
but
a
thin
white
head
and
no
lacing
and
little
aroma
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
but
mostly
watery
at
mid
glass
hints
of
malt
were
trying
to
enter
but
were
mostly
overcome
by
stale
taste
metallic
finish
left
me
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
again
given
the
high
ratings
by
others
ill
try
a
fresh
one
this
fall
as
fresh
as
i
can
get
in
atlanta
ga
the
drinkability
is
prima
remember
this
is
a
beer
brewed
for
the
fest
it
is
a
pure

comments
i
likes
this
would
drink
it
again
but
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
maybe
the
bottle
i
had
wasnt
the
freshest
im
sure
it
would
be
much
better
when
freshly
brewed
notes
i
could
see
this
brew
keeping
my
interest
at
oktoberfest
not
the
most
complex
beer
for
the
style
but
it
sticks
to
its
guns
and
produces
an
enjoyable
true
blue
gobbler
this
brew
has
a
very
smooth
medium
body
drink
starts
creamy
and
morphs
into
a
prickly
bitter
carbonation
bath
taste
is
of
bread
or
grain
with
a
predominant
rindlike
hop
presence
alcohol
presence
is
not
as
evident
as
is
the
hop
bitterness
finishes
quite
clean
while
not
well
versed
on
this
style
this
was
enjoyable
big
maltiness
up
front
and
the
moderate
bitterness
prevents
the
flavor
from
crawling
away
since
the
malt
character
dies
off
tasty
especially
the
aftertaste
very
smooth
with
few
esters
and
a
clean
malt
profile
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
this
oner
lurking
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
i
sometimes
find
german
beers
a
little
dull
due
to
the
rigidity
of
the
purity
law
but
this
is
quality
beer
engineering
i
actually
had
this
with
some
rouladen
and
it
matched
up
quite
well
d
an
interesting
märzen
a
quality
and
subtle
variation
on
the
type
while
also
staying
true
to
others
enjoyable
and
well
worth
drinking
again
either
in
these
early
spring
days
or
during
the
fall
drinkability
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
in
a
beer
garden
in
germany
it
lacks
a
little
something
but
whatever
it
is
its
minor
good
beer
ive
had
a
lot
better
marzens
than
this
it
smells
and
tastes
weird
to
me
hazy
amberish
bronze
color
with
a
huge
thick
creamy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
really
highly
carbonated
in
appearance
smells
quite
bready
with
those
german
yeasty
phenolics
kicking
in
strong
a
slightly
cooked
hop
element
is
there
as
well
taste
also
gets
dominated
by
the
bready
flavors
not
really
sweet
bready
but
more
doughy
bread
characteristics
kind
of
toasty
a
bit
of
banana
there
as
well
some
trace
caramel
a
much
creamier
body
than
i
was
expecting
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
as
well
the
flavors
are
long
and
drawn
out
a
floral
estery
hop
flavor
rides
with
the
malts
malty
but
not
sweet
and
the
finish
is
drying
and
lingering
smooth
not
as
carbonated
in
mouthfeel
as
i
was
expecting
this
is
certainly
a
nice
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
slightly
hazy
nice
size
head
with
good
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
about
what
i
would
expect
for
a
marzen
taste
was
good
some
malt
flavor
detected
mouthfeel
was
about
right
not
too
thin
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
goes
down
well
nothing
spectacular
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
if
the
hacker
pschorr
warsteiner
or
sam
adams
marzen
was
available
still
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
very
very
slight
buttery
diacetyl
in
the
finish
but
otherwise
the
perfect
refreshing
lager
that
i
was
looking
for
tonight
if
only
my
friend
had
brought
back
more
prima
pils
on
his
recent
beer
travels
to
illinoismichigan
another
ayinger
gem
pours
a
bright
and
clear
copper
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
fell
quickly
smelled
of
pumpkins
and
oranges
pineapple
and
all
spice
the
sweetness
in
the
smell
has
a
nice
grainy
and
citrus
base
the
flavor
consists
of
a
thin
molasses
malt
and
some
subtle
citrus
thats
more
flavor
than
sour
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
bit
of
metal
mouth
feel
is
thick
with
a
lot
of
little
bubbles
500
ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
toasted
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
some
initial
lace
smells
of
darktoasted
malts
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
with
spicygreen
hops
and
some
metal
with
a
bit
of
a
vinous
quality
that
makes
me
wonder
if
its
a
fresh
bottle
it
has
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
if
it
is
fresh
theres
not
enough
toasted
malts
or
hop
presence
in
my
opinion
opinion
this
is
a
superb
example
of
an
oktoberfest
this
one
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
but
it
still
manages
to
retain
the
characteristic
flavor
for
the
style
there
is
plenty
of
vienna
malt
in
this
one
to
give
it
a
really
wellrounded
and
flavorful
profile
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beeror
anything
else
from
ayinger
brau
for
that
matter
now
this
is
what
im
talking
about
the
germans
call
their
beer
fluessiges
brot
liquid
bread
and
this
beer
has
that
quality
in
spades
when
you
drink
it
the
mouthfeel
is
truly
beyond
description
malts
rich
grainy
malts
in
your
mouth
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
and
thats
saying
something
wowweeee
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
and
i
drink
a
fair
amount
of
beer
pours
a
brillant
copperish
amber
hue
with
a
thick
and
frothy
beige
head
that
retains
extremely
well
a
beautiful
beer
the
aroma
is
just
as
good
with
a
big
caramel
malt
and
toasted
bread
character
followed
by
an
earthy
grassy
and
floral
noble
hops
character
very
authentic
and
it
almost
jumps
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
more
subdued
than
the
nose
would
let
on
with
notes
of
caramel
toasted
bread
minerals
grassy
and
floral
hops
and
a
slightly
musty
hay
character
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
but
not
overwhelming
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
excellent
marzen
authentic
balanced
and
delicious
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
cheers
unimpressed
probably
wont
drink
again
poured
out
copper
with
a
frothy
head
that
didnt
quit
on
me
smells
of
mostly
sweet
malts
the
malts
tasted
very
bready
reminded
me
of
biscuits
with
honey
pleasant
hop
bitterness
rounds
it
out
but
still
lets
the
sweet
malts
shine
through
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
bubbly
and
helped
to
wake
up
my
tongue
with
each
sip
i
could
see
myself
making
this
a
session
beer
if
it
were
a
little
less
pricey
i
wish
i
wouldve
bought
more
than
one
pint
tonight
drinkability
an
easy
to
drink
octoberfest
very
enjoyable
id
drink
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
others
copper
colored
with
a
thick
dense
head
aromas
of
sweet
nutbread
malt
on
a
faint
lemony
hop
frame
nose
is
malty
with
cookiedough
at
first
then
a
dry
bittersweet
cocoa
note
mid
palate
some
spicy
hop
flavors
are
present
just
before
the
mediumclean
finish
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
plenty
of
carbonation
but
not
over
board
almost
alelike
in
the
finish
sort
of
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
and
not
very
tight
almost
muddled
but
interesting
enough
to
have
another
one
slightly
outside
the
typical
german
marzen
style
but
i
liked
it
alot
and
would
buy
this
again
d
excellent
great
finish
great
for
an
ofest
session
so
nicely
balanced
yet
very
flavorful
a
bready
quality
of
the
malt
was
quite
fresh
and
yummy
yet
the
finish
was
clean
and
even
with
a
mild
hoppy
note
very
engaging
beer
that
was
at
its
peak
extremely
drinkable
by
far
the
best
octoberfest
bier
ive
ever
sampled
edit
as
time
has
passed
i
find
that
i
like
this
beer
more
and
more
its
probably
my
favorite
imported
traditional
oktoberfest
and
i
havent
noticed
the
thick
mouthfeel
as
much
as
i
used
to
this
is
very
pleasant
drinking
though
the
flavor
isnt
really
that
much
of
a
standout
to
me
the
texture
of
the
thing
is
very
autumnal
and
it
begs
to
be
sessioned
pity
i
could
only
enjoy
half
a
liter
poured
a
clear
medium
copper
color
with
slightly
offwhite
magnificient
puffy
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
caramelly
toasty
dry
and
hoppy
finishes
with
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
maltiness
and
dry
hoppiness
in
just
the
right
proportions
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
supremely
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
mildly
crisp
at
the
start
finish
is
smooth
soft
caramel
tones
linger
on
the
tongue
briefly
after
swallowing
decent
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
to
enjoy
during
a
cool
october
afternoon
john
drinkability
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
without
complaint
smooth
and
with
a
nice
malty
finish
it
reminds
me
of
crisp
fall
days
sitting
around
a
fire
enjoyable
but
not
spectacular
creamy
on
the
palate
and
malty
in
flavor
doesnt
seem
that
complex
not
a
bad
beer
but
somewhat
weak
smooth
and
very
drinkable
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
overall
eh
kind
of
bland
for
an
ofest
but
its
not
terrible
off
the
top
of
my
head
id
recommend
a
halfdozen
others
in
the
style
ahead
of
it
though
taste
is
caramel
lightly
burnt
toast
vanilla
lightly
sweet
with
a
balanced
bitter
finish
m
a
light
bodied
brew
very
characteristic
of
the
marzen
style
taste
has
some
of
those
fruity
esters
i
experienced
in
my
last
ayinger
beer
a
little
thin
esters
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
good
malty
beer
though
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
that
ive
had
no
beer
can
be
trueer
to
style
smells
solidly
malty
bready
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
nuttiness
appears
light
coper
crystal
clear
with
moderate
carbonation
lays
a
perfect
1
head
and
stays
firm
tastes
moderately
of
sweet
maltgiving
a
caramel
and
nut
flavor
noble
hop
additions
offer
nice
bitter
balance
and
a
good
citrus
spiciness
toasty
and
bready
into
the
body
and
finish
body
is
smooth
and
nicely
creamy
extremely
clean
and
refreshing
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
citrus
notes
gives
an
almostmint
character
in
the
refreshing
aftertaste
dangerously
easy
to
drink
ideal
for
almost
any
occation
tasty
has
a
burnt
toast
nutty
malt
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
finishes
crisp
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
fluffy
clean
middling
carbonation
a
little
sticky
on
the
finish
nothing
to
complain
about
a
solid
brew
obtained
from
liquor
mart
boulder
and
consumed
that
same
evening
pours
a
whoa
four
finger
tanyellow
head
over
a
crystal
clear
light
gold
rust
liquid
the
head
eventually
fell
like
a
crmbling
sinkhole
smells
of
toasted
grains
and
fresh
hops
tettnanger
really
floral
hoppy
and
enticing
hints
of
caramel
beneath
tastes
watery
malty
sweet
with
noticable
tettnanger
hop
flavor
and
mild
hop
bitter
carb
is
gentle
and
mixes
well
with
the
sugar
sweet
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
honey
then
burnt
from
the
tett
hops
hang
around
munich
malt
flavor
is
very
minimal
as
the
beer
warms
the
toasty
and
a
phenolic
come
out
not
quite
cherry
sour
the
taste
hangs
like
dried
twigs
the
hop
floral
gives
it
a
dried
forest
floor
flavor
lean
in
body
but
unfailing
in
flavor
classic
quite
a
delicious
lager
here
tastee
let
me
say
tasteee
poured
a
cloudy
amber
orange
with
a
big
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
had
some
caramel
sweet
fruit
and
some
breadiness
very
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
some
floral
hops
not
too
bitter
finishes
dry
and
clean
pretty
decent
lager
amidst
all
the
american
interpretations
of
the
style
though
many
are
quite
good
i
went
in
search
of
a
true
marzen
and
came
across
this
pours
into
my
german
lager
mug
a
toasted
amber
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
looks
quite
appealing
toasted
grainy
cracker
aroma
sweet
and
malty
begins
initially
sweet
toasted
malt
dusting
the
palate
followed
by
dry
wheat
notes
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
carbonation
very
lightly
tingles
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
lends
to
a
damn
smooth
beer
what
it
lacks
in
flavor
it
almost
makes
up
for
in
smooth
character
and
drinkability
good
with
pretzels
and
probably
better
with
some
brats
and
kraut
a
little
light
in
color
but
at
least
its
not
as
light
as
the
hofbrauhaus
oktoberfest
tastes
sweet
mouthfeel
on
the
lips
is
kind
of
sticky
a
nice
hint
of
smokiness
here
and
a
toasty
malt
character
poured
a
big
frothy
head
which
is
nice
this
is
one
im
finishing
off
the
whole
bottle
after
having
just
a
taster
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
it
is
slightly
cloudy
the
head
is
fluffy
white
it
fades
slowly
leaving
only
a
few
laces
it
smells
fruity
almost
raisin
lke
it
is
also
slightly
buscity
there
is
a
faint
lemon
aroma
also
it
also
has
a
slight
hop
escence
it
has
a
slightly
malty
taste
the
taste
is
sort
of
hard
to
describe
it
has
a
toasted
malt
taste
the
hop
flavor
is
only
very
slightly
noticable
ultimately
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
either
a
little
more
hoppy
or
more
roasted
malts
maybe
it
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
it
is
carbonated
well
it
might
make
a
good
session
beer
because
it
is
not
aggressive
it
is
also
not
to
high
in
alcohol
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
apricot
golden
copper
body
with
a
big
thick
light
creamkhaki
head
good
lacing
too
nose
is
full
of
bready
malts
spicy
yeast
light
sweetness
and
faint
hop
bitterness
taste
starts
with
slightly
sweet
toasted
bread
malt
flavors
some
caramel
too
peppery
yeasty
bitterness
early
on
as
well
finish
stays
bready
with
a
yeasty
edge
me
gusta
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
very
drinkable
overall
impression
this
is
a
standard
german
marzen
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
except
for
the
color
pours
a
light
coppery
color
with
a
mediumsized
head
like
meringue
appears
very
effervescent
as
bubbles
stream
up
all
throughout
the
brew
smells
of
bread
raisins
molasses
and
brown
sugar
maybe
some
banana
in
there
too
tastes
predominantly
of
bread
like
sourdough
flavors
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
are
present
as
well
slight
astringency
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
finish
which
is
very
crisp
and
clean
leaves
a
pleasant
taste
in
my
mouth
carbonation
is
high
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
not
too
bad
though
very
drinkable
very
disappointing
overall
and
not
fit
for
the
style
got
this
on
a
recommendation
upon
asking
for
a
nice
malty
lager
this
delivers
nicely
appearance
is
kind
of
a
chill
haze
golden
color
with
a
snow
white
head
there
is
a
mild
dose
of
biscuity
type
maltiness
and
some
fresh
somewhat
skunky
hops
in
the
aroma
taste
is
also
mild
with
the
perfect
combination
of
hops
malt
to
stay
clean
refreshing
yet
still
full
flavorful
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
a
good
slickness
to
it
and
as
for
the
drinkability
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
but
pine
for
something
a
bit
more
complex
a
good
brew
drinkability
nothing
special
for
the
style
seems
to
have
missed
the
target
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
mislabeled
one
ive
enjoyed
several
other
beers
from
this
brewer
sadly
this
wasnt
one
of
them
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
sweet
bready
grainy
aromas
light
grainy
nutty
and
caramel
flavors
finishes
clean
and
dry
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
well
done
oktoberfest
i
look
forward
to
this
every
year
pours
an
orangegold
bright
and
clear
large
head
of
medium
sized
bubbles
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
supplying
the
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
honey
a
slight
hop
bite
celan
and
malty
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
slightly
hop
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
near
my
jaw
bready
with
a
bit
of
orange
marmalade
on
top
makes
this
one
tasty
brew
i
will
be
happy
to
try
this
one
again
next
oktober
sampled
from
a
17
oz
bottle
the
color
of
this
beer
is
goldenorange
with
nice
creamy
head
mildly
hazy
aroma
is
malty
as
expected
bready
and
caramel
aromas
stand
out
smell
isnt
very
powerful
the
beginning
of
a
sip
is
somewhat
grainy
and
has
some
bite
the
middle
is
primarily
big
malt
tastes
with
some
grainy
balance
finish
is
pronounced
lingering
sweetness
like
all
the
german
beers
ive
tried
this
is
easytodrink
and
wellmade
however
i
think
i
like
the
paulaner
and
spaten
ofests
better
drank
very
easy
with
a
small
finish
this
is
a
delicious
beer
nice
and
rich
it
pours
into
my
glass
an
amber
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
like
caramel
candied
apples
mouthfeel
is
generally
full
and
smooth
a
great
malty
sweetness
perfectly
offset
by
hops
and
carbonation
very
very
drinkable
to
say
the
least
woohoo
shared
a
bottle
with
david
this
evening
pour
was
the
best
part
all
coppery
and
topped
with
a
craggy
thick
cream
colored
head
full
of
peaks
and
valleys
then
we
took
some
whiffs
and
unfortunately
there
were
some
metallic
notes
that
lead
to
pennies
from
heaven
and
then
of
course
pfennige
vom
himmel
hoch
we
got
past
the
silliness
and
dove
in
somewhat
sweet
tries
to
finish
with
some
bitterness
but
the
pennies
came
back
at
the
end
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
actually
that
was
broken
up
by
the
carbonation
not
bad
just
not
great
its
a
light
amber
color
fairly
clear
with
a
moderatelysized
white
head
very
slight
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aroma
with
a
background
of
hops
light
sweetness
with
a
mix
of
malt
and
graininess
notable
hop
presence
in
the
finish
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
certainly
quite
drinkable
still
i
prefer
my
marzens
to
have
a
bit
more
toasted
malt
character
this
ones
a
little
weak
i
checked
my
reviews
before
popping
the
cap
and
was
amazed
to
see
that
i
hadnt
rated
any
beer
of
this
style
higher
than
4
0
brauerei
ayings
version
doesnt
quite
get
there
either
but
in
the
only
score
that
really
counts
taste
its
the
equal
of
any
ive
had
these
guys
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
nice

dominates
the
aroma
some
light
hops
and
some
light
spice
also
picked
up
in
the
background
coriander
taste
is
good
malty
and
zesty
carbonation
tingles
the
taste
buds
finishes
with
a
peppery
hoppy
combination
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
strange
for
a
marzen
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
right
around
medium
a
refreshing
brew
drinkability
is
good
strange
addition
of
spice
know
against
that
german
law
to
add
stuff
to
beer
but
it
sure
tasted
like
coriander
but
guess
it
could
have
been
the
yeast
adding
some
spiciness
anyway
it
was
a
decent
beer
should
be
tried
if
you
can
this
big
bottle550ml
of
german
marzen
went
down
like
it
was
a
12oz
bottle
why
because
its
drinkability
was
off
the
charts
the
hops
and
malt
combine
to
create
a
smooth
oktoberfest
beer
that
has
the
body
of
one
and
the
color
of
one
i
will
regret
when
i
finish
my
case
of
these
beauties
ein
prosit
baby
this
is
quite
drinkable
while
not
what
i
would
call
exceptional
id
be
happy
to
quaff
several
of
these
at
my
local
if
the
situation
provided
for
it
an
excelent
oktoberfest
this
one
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
left
fluffy
white
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
hops
and
spice
the
taste
was
great
and
not
overly
malty
like
some
oktoberfests
this
one
had
a
nice
subtle
hop
presence
that
kept
everything
in
check
that
along
with
a
nice
smoothe
mouthfeel
made
this
one
veryt
drinkable
and
dare
i
say
my
new
favorite
ofest
beer
next
to
the
lowenbrau
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
brew
poured
very
orange
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
white
head
nice
sticky
lacing
smelled
lightly
of
hops
just
a
touch
very
malty
and
left
a
light
roasted
malty
like
taste
in
my
mouth
very
smooth
not
too
heavy
but
not
light
either
a
nice
balance
great
example
of
an
oktoberfest
3
spaten
had
the
majority
of
a
pitcher
of
this
at
the
local
pub
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
caramelfilled
and
has
just
a
tad
of
what
i
like
to
call
lager
stank
the
flavor
had
the
caramel
maltiness
that
i
expected
but
there
is
a
hop
andor
spice
presence
that
just
doesnt
blend
this
is
one
of
the
few
brews
ive
had
where
i
have
drank
enough
to
actually
be
totally
full
of
beer
and
unable
to
drink
anymore
without
being
drunk
not
a
favorite
beer
here
i
drank
a
pitcher
of
this
beer
tonight
it
poured
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
about
3
fingers
of
head
the
nose
was
full
of
nice
caramel
sweetness
enticing
me
to
drink
it
the
flavor
hit
me
upfront
with
caramel
sweetness
but
then
came
a
spiceyness
that
was
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
liking
as
far
as
other
ofest
beers
goes
this
was
not
my
favorite
i
liked
the
spaten
this
year
a
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
thick
and
a
little
creamy
drinkability
was
pretty
good
hell
i
drank
the
whole
pitcher
didnt
i
i
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
earlier
this
year
and
didnt
like
it
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
it
the
beer
arrived
in
a
500
ml
bottle
with
packaging
styled
similarly
for
most
of
this
brewerys
offerings
the
body
was
golden
pale
in
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
faded
into
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
very
faint
for
the
style
with
only
a
hint
of
the
underlying
munich
caramel
malts
the
taste
was
a
malty
as
anticipated
but
had
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
and
lemony
tang
than
other
festbiers
ive
had
there
was
also
a
faint
metallic
twang
in
there
the
aftertaste
was
grainy
and
mouthfeel
mediumthin
sessionable
seasonal
offering
but
not
an
exceptional

from
the
bottom

mild

flavor
with
a
slight
grainy
bite
towards
the
end
theres
a
bit
of
hops
in
there
that
cut
the
malt
and
smooth
out
the
taste
moderately
light
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
lead
to
a
beer
that
keeps
me
drinking
the
flavor
is
great
on
a
crisp
night
when
you
are
feeling
reflective
lovely
quite
fruity
mainly
apple
and
dark
fruits
with
malt
notes
of
bread
and
light
caramel
quite
sweet
as
well
the
hops
seem
perfect
in
this
impressive

this

is
slightly

and
spicier

others

good
bodya
very
drinkable
beer
i
find
this
a
bit
more
interesting
then
the
munich
breweries
offering
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
light
but
creamy
texture
drinkability
is
improved
by
not
being
overwhelming
or
too
spicy
up
front
i
would
place
this
at
the
top
of
the
ofests
that
ive
sampled
but
i
find
that
such
is
typical
of
this
brewer
brilliant
clear
amber
with
a
buttercolored
crumpettop
which
stands
inches
tall
herbed
honey
aromas
tease
the
line
between
savory
and
sweet
dense
aromas
of
milled
raw
grains
are
there
too
candylike
malt
flavors
are
given
thrust
with
steely
caked
hop
extracts
mouthfilling
yet
light
and
melting
dormant
august
grasses
fritters
and
honey
sensations
linger
on
the
finish
this
is
a
foursquare
progressivestyled
maerzen
tightly
integrated
clean
and
clear
id
like
to
see
it
age
about
6
months
to
a
year
however
it
is
a
waste
of
lager
art
to
drink
these
too
young
as
they
taste
like
malty
hoppy
extremes
of
their
cognate
light
lagers
the
material
is
there
for
development
patience
will
be
rewarded
drinkability
and
overall
i
am
suitably
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
seems
no
different
than
a
craft
pale
ale
to
me
maybe
thats
what
it
should
taste
like
but
if
im
in
a
celebratory
ofest
kind
of
mode
then
why
not
just
break
out
a
nice
pale
ale
this
beer
loses
me
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
oktoberfest
beer
i
dont
think
this
one
is
it
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
to
me
pours
a
pale
amber
clear
liquid
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
good
head
retention
and
some
fair
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
fairly
big
malt
nose
slightly
flowery
and
carmellike
nice
malt
sweetness
again
with
a
carmel
flavor
some
slight
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
malt
medium
body
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
not
as
clean
as
i
would
expect
good
beer
nonetheless

dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
stays
with
you
for
a
while
goes
to
lacing
around
the
glass
after
a
while
smell
consisted
of
malts
caramel
and
some
toasted
aromas
also
showing
up
smell
was
also
on
the
sweet
side
taste
was
average
malts
in
abundence
with
some
hops
staying
way
in
the
background
but
not
forgotten
some
caramel
then
mixes
in
and
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
but
turned
a
little
watery
and
some
alochol
also
shows
up
at
the
tail
end
not
bad
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
over
this
this
brew
is
a
somewhat
dark
orange
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
light
scent
the
taste
is
mainly
malt
with
bread
grain
and
some
caramel
tones
coming
through
nice
clean
hop
bitterness
also
present
light
to
med
bodied
overall
a
nice
bavarian
feel
malty
brew
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
possibly
the
best
of
the
typical
german
brands
commonly
available
around
dallas
paulaner
spaten
hackerpschorr
are
the
most
common
i
ironically
responded
to
a
thread
on
the
ba
forum
yesterday
from
jason
inquiring
about
this
brews
availability
in
the
boston
area
and
i
go
to
work
after
a
day
off
and
queue
heavenly
music
behold
it
pours
a
clear
lighter
bronze
color
or
deep
orangy
golden
color
with
a
light
beige
colored
head
very
husky
and
vienna
malty
biscuity
aroma
with
a
small
but
not
unnoticable
floral
background
this
years
release
from
the
folks
at
ayinger
has
some
hops
im
venturing
to
guess
theres
some
hallertauer
hersbrucker
in
there
the
hops
meld
quite
nicely
with
the
astringent
huskiness
of
the
malt
to
produce
an
oktoberfest
that
is
thirstquenching
and
delicious
very
malty
however
not
overly
malty
sweet
theres
a
residual
flowery
esteriness
proof
positive
that
theres
hops
its
exquisitely
balanced
and
wickedly
drinkable
each
sip
warrants
another
objectively
this
years
batch
has
to
be
one
of
the
finer
oktoberfests
ive
ever
tried
a
straightup
grain
masterpiece
with
ample
carbonation
that
keeps
it
fresh
on
the
palate
and
enjoyable
if
youre
a
stickler
for
balance
or
hops
for
that
matter
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
i
enjoy
big
malts
so
this
was
quite
pleasing
to
my
palette
it
is
very
sweet
not
desert
beer
sweet
and
sticky
but
it
is
a
quality
brew
from
ayinger
when
all
is
said
and
done
mediumfull
body
and
smooth
another
winner
from
a
great
brewery
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
next
year
and
maybe
some
more
marzens
as
ive
only
had
a
couple
tasty
brew
from
germany
i
like
this
but
from
the
flavor
i
have
to
wonder
if
there
isnt
some
rye
used
in
the
malting
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
malty
lager
scent
it
has
the
dry
scent
of
a
typical
lager
but
with
a
malty
edge
that
smells
great
the
taste
is
decent
it
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
good
fest
beer
one
id
buy
again
big
offwhite
crusty
head
on
top
of
a
slightly
hazy
teaorangecolored
beer
nose
is
maltolicious
malty
sweetish
buttery
turns
a
little
sourish
with
some
cream
and
some
veggies
a
touch
of
metal
in
the
finish
i
like
this
beer
nice
and
malty
the
malt
sweetness
comes
through
constantly
accompanied
by
spice
this
is
a
juicy
beer
it
stimulates
my
entire
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
can
be
a
great
food
beer
with
the
carbonation
cleansing
the
palette
and
the
sweetness
adding
to
the
food
it
would
work
well
with
all
the
food
associated
with
the
oktoberfest
it
still
remains
my
standard
for
the
style
i
worry
about
the
vegetal
smell
and
hope
that
it
doesnt
recurr
in
future
samples
overall
a
reasonably
good
quality
oktober
festmärzen
lager
that
is
highly
focused
on
its
clean
malt
profile
but
lacks
complexity
and
mouthfeel
yet
is
nevertheless
very
drinkable
not
bad
really
and
well
worth
trying
but
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
orange
amber
in
appearence
with
a
well
retained
white
head
light
caramel
aroma
with
a
very
subtle
hop
character
very
thin
mouthfeel
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
taste
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
this
one
seems
to
be
missing
the
clean
sweetness
that
i
have
come
to
expect
drinkability

this
went
down
nicely
and
would
be
well
at
home
at
a
bayern
oktoberfest
celebration
not
bad
as
an
oktoberfest
even
though
its
not
a
munich
brewery
but
not
amongst
the
best
of
the
season
either
once
ive
gotten
to
my
favorites
next
year
i
just
might
give
it
a
try
an
amber
octoberfest
that
pours
with
a
creamy
white
head
it
has
a
slightly
vegetal
nose
mixed
with
a
malt
aroma
poured
in
an
ayinger
half
liter
glass
this
beer
has
a
huge
pillowy
head
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
light
caramel
munich
malt
flavors
that
marzens
are
known
for
flourish
in
the
beer
a
very
quaffable
fresh
example
of
an
amber
marzen
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
very
drinkable
yet
flavorful
beer
i
feel
lucky
to
have
found
a
very
fresh
bottle
of
this
beer
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
three
fat
fingers
of
foam
there
is
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
with
some
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
pretty
malty
but
lacks
some
of
the
hops
from
the
smell
the
body
and
drinkability
are
just
above
average
not
a
bad
choice
for
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
seemed
slightly
thin
minor
quibble
and
drinakbility
was
high
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
close
to
the
source
i
bet
it
would
be
awesome
as
it
is
its
a
very
fine
ofest
smooth
with
a
bit
of
crisp
carbonation
nice
rich
maltiness
at
the
start
grains
come
in
next
while
the
hops
balance
to
near
perfection
so
far
this
year
the
oktoberfests
have
been
a
bit
of
a
let
down
but
this
one
is
solid
the
body
is
medium
and
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
drinkable
this
is
an
all
dayer
good
for
the
season
or
any
time
of
year
a
nice
fall
choice
would
go
nice
with
some
sausage
and
lentils
one
of
the
best
things
about
it
is
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
the
big
big
bottle
i
love
germany
this
beer
has
the
best
head
out
of
all
the
fests
ive
tried
beautiful
finebeaded
head
no
yeast
sediment
in
bottle
and
very
clear
beer
as
opposed
to
previous
reviewer
this
was
out
of
a
500ml
bottle
though
i
found
the
nose
quite
interesting
subtle
for
sure
but
there
was
something
interesting
in
there
that
reminded
me
of
honey
definately
malty
but
some
honey
in
there
too
more
complex
sugars
in
there
might
produce
that
kind
of
scent
definately
a
drier
lighter
fest
than
the
others
ive
had
this
one
still
has
some
of
the
malty
goodness
that
makes
fest
good
overall
id
drink
this
again
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
but
if
given
the
chance
i
would
drink
many
other
ofests
before
this
im
kind
of
disapointed
because
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
an
interesting
take
on
an
oktfest
beer
whatever
the
yeast
choice
is
i
think
contributes
to
what
seem
to
be
off
flavors
for
this
style
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
sneaky
maybe
more
than
i
thought
i
would
have
more
but
im
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
either
enjoy
medium
bodied
with
a
noticeable
tang
of
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
golden
amber
color
with
a
sturdy
offwhite
head
nice
rings
of
lace
remain
on
the
glass
malty
nose
is
complemented
by
some
sweetness
mild
hops
and
bread
dough
taste
is
superbly
balanced
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
a
fine
earthy
hop
finish
pleases
the
palate
this
brew
is
mediumbodied
and
fills
the
mouth
quite
appropriately
extremely
drinkable
great
festbier
a
great
ofest
the
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
oktoberfest
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
caramels
and
sweetness
big
malt
against
a
hop
bitterness
that
does
not
quite
equal
out
the
malt
reigns
supreme
making
this
beer
a
little
too
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
little
hit
of
spice
nice
smooth
texture
though
make
up
for
some
of
the
unbalanced
flavors
but
not
enough
this
is
my
first
year
with
ayinger
so
i
dont
know
if
it
has
been
better
in
the
past
but
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
is
decent
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nothing
holding
this
beer
back
a
slight
tang
feeling
but
it
does
not
hurt
its
drinkability
a
nice
beer
but
i
wish
the
hops
were
a
bit
stronger
average
body
and
mouthfeel
about
right
for
the
style
a
fine
selection
on
a
cool
evening
although
the
sourness
could
lessen
the
appeal
for
some
makes
the
beer
more
nichelike
its
good
though
this
poured
out
a
golden
orange
amber
bright
and
clear
dense
and
creamy
off
white
head
topped
this
brew
nice
aroma
of
spices
and
pepper
along
with
some
sour
fruitiness
in
tasting
i
notice
the
beer
has
some
thick
syrupy
qualities
to
it
theres
also
some
fermented
fruits
in
there
its
full
bodied
well
rounded
and
seems
to
finish
clean
a
very
nice
authentic
munich
oktoberfest
beer
a
hazy
orangish
amber
body
is
capped
by
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
holds
well
before
dropping
to
a
thin
collar
but
leaves
only
minimal
lace
the
aroma
displays
a
straightforward
lightly
sweet
maltiness
its
medium
bodied
with
a
very
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
light
caress
on
the
tognue
before
warming
to
become
more
creamy
and
smooth
the
flavor
offers
a
somewhat
caramelized
bready
maltiness
and
a
mild
fruitiness
hop
flavors
take
a
backseat
and
its
wellbalanced
to
emphasis
its
maltiness
with
a
restrained
bitterness
thats
just
enough
to
keep
the
beer
from
becoming
sweet
it
finishes
semidry
with
a
short
flash
of
alcohol
and
some
delicate
spicy
hops
that
leave
it
crisp
and
refreshing
quite
enjoyable
i
much
prefer
it
to
the
bottled
version
as
it
seems
smoother
and
a
touch
more
malty
a
slight
bit
less
fruity
less
tart
and
less
hazy
with
a
better
head
broad
malt
a
touch
of
fruit
and
a
hint
a
noble
hops
finishes
fairly
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
medium
bodied
crisp
with
robust
carbonation
color
is
a
lighter
then
most
amber
with
some
chill
haze
thin
whitish
loose
head
fades
out
quick
and
leaves
no
lace
airy
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malts
and
light
toasted
grains
lightly
crisp
wheat
thin
crackerlike
with
some
fainted
fresh
herbal
hops
in
the
back
taste
comes
across
with
an
even
amount
of
light
bready
dough
sweetness
and
crackerlike
toastedness
mostly
upfront
midway
tends
to
loosen
up
a
bit
with
some
caramel
and
light
ripe
melon
husk
sweetness
mixed
gently
with
smooth
lightly
herbal

finish

some
subtle
malty
mixes
of
sweet
and
toast
things
meshing
over
some
light
earthyness
and
crisp
wood
feel
is
a
close
to
medium
body
with
some
lightness
coming
in
through
the
midway
point
and
into
the
finish
which
ends
lightly
creamy
and
crispened
not
what
i
would
quite
call
a
good
ofest
however
i
do
like
its
subtlities
theres
just
not
enough
push
in
flavor
and
body
for
me
to
really
take
notice
i
still
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
its
smooth
and
refreshing
and
a
delight
to
drink
pours
a
brilliant
clear
orange
with
a
large
white

that
lasts
lacing
nicely
aroma
is
all
malt
some
toast
lots
of
raw
smelling
grain
and
a
tiny
bit
of

flavor
is
of
sweet
and
raw
graininess
maybe
a
bit
of
hoppiness
in
the
finish
on
the
medium
side
of
thin
for
the
body
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
ok
but
seems
to
be
missing
something
to
me
lots
and
lots
of
malt
in
this
one
and
that
is
a
good
thing
pours
out
to
a
bright
amber
with
a
decent
head
nice
smell
of
malts
yeast
and
fresh
baked

is

just
a
tinge
on
the
sweet
side
itching
for
the
hops
detection
but
i
cant
seem
to
scratch
some
carbonation
which
seems
to
offset
the
taste
something
does
not
feel
right
here
but
a
great
session

very

a

a

a
bit
of

with

quikly
disappearing
aftertaste
some
alcohol
is
apparent
full
bodied
with

smooth

top
notch
this
is
probably
a
very
traditional
oktoberfest
beer
but
i
really
was
not
blown
away
light
honey
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
offwhite
head
sweet
smelling
almost
yeasty
with
some
toffee
aromas
flavor
was
chewy
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
yeasty
notes
and
a
small
bit
of
citrus
coming
through
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
slick
couldnt
finish
the
glass
very
nice
head
somewhat
cloudy
coppery
appearance
smell
was
almost
wheatlike
taste
also
had
a
wheatlike
quality
with
a
slight
lemony
quality
not
that
impressive
mouthfeel
was
just
ok
just
didnt
grab
me
drinkability
was
just
average
didnt
go
down
that
smoothly
overall
a
good
oktoberfest
thats
nicely
balanced
on
draught
at
the
winking
lizard
tavern
in
columbus
oh
this
beer
is
a
hazy
bright
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
fair
amount
of
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
hops
mediumbodied
with
a
lot
of
malt
from
the
getgo
the
beer
does
seem
to
get
a
little
spicier
and
hoppier
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
the
finish
is
light
and
a
little
hoppy
this
is
a
good
seasonal
from
ayinger
ayinger
pours
a
zesty
copper
orange
tone
with
amber
highlights
and
a
huge
fluffy
cream
colored
head
oh
so
nice
appearance
aroma
is
wonderfully
bready
with
spices
peaking
through
and
not
so
much
all
toasted
malt
but
more
of
a
clean
freshness
to
it
its
amazing
i
love
this
beers
aroma
hallertau
hops
tie
it
together
favorite
part
about
it
is
the
fact
that
the
flavor
isnt
overly
sweet
rush
of
well
nothing
its
so
balanced
its
not
too
forceful
with
anything
rather
this
beer
decides
to
harmonize
to
my
taste
buds
with
a
rolling
mix
of
spice
and
herb
tones
with
a
bread
slightly
toasted
malt
character
and
a
very
clean
finish
wow
this
is
awesome
not
cloying
so
creamy
and
textured
almost
chewy
and
good
great
brew
that
is
authentic
as
the
name
ayinger
the
clean
finish
is
just
great
drinkability
oh
by
the
liter
what
it
was
designed
for
im
about
to
get
a
keg
of
this
stuff
its
that
great
cant
wait
to
try
paulaner
and
hacker
schorr
and
the
rest
of
the
german
oktoberfest
this
beer
starts
out
rather
impressive
with
a
nice
orangecaramel
color
and
sporting
a
rich
creamy
head
the
color
of
milk
solids
when
butter
is
clarified
loads
of
stick
throughout
but
in
the
mouth
the
beer
fights
to
be
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
trying
to
be
a
more
serious
brew
perhaps
this
is
intended
as
it
is
a
fall
brew
and
fall
itself
is
fighting
in
the
same
way
the
flavors
are
very
much
caramel
malt
with
just
a
wee
bit
of
hopping
that
adds
some
twang
to
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
brew
yet
maybe
a
tad
out
of
balance
i
also
find
a
slightly
annoying
hairspray
and
beeswax
flavor
that
keeps
chiming
in
as
i
sample
i
think
this
beer
needs
food
music
and
dancing
german
girls
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
a
warm
pretzel
with
brown
mustard
would
do
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
little
orange
tint
to
it
with
a
pretty
nice

aroma
is
very
doughy
and
and
toasted
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
at
first
with
some
definent
breadlike
undertonesthere
is
a
dryeness
in
the
finish
i
like
a
good
marzen
to
have
more
sweetness
to
it
this
is
a
little
dry
but
it
is
pretty
well
made
and
drinkable

malty

this
brew
is
quite
a
disappointment
considering
the
source
i
might
guess
that
age
has
something
to
do
with
the
off
flavors
but
its
not
a
cardboardy
oxidation
flavor
thats
the
problem
a
very
good
beer
this
is
extremely
drinkable
the
pour
from
the
500
ml
bottle
created
a
huge
ivory
head
over
a
hazy
amber
body
the
packaging
is
great
the
graceful
longneck
body
is
beautifully
labeled
and
capped
with
the
distinctive
ayinger
cap
the
head
lingers
long
and
laces
very
well
the
nose
is
malty
and
also
gives
distinctive
grassy
notes
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
between
creamy
smoothness
and
sharp
body
notes
the
sips
are
accompanied
by
very
nice
aromas
of
maltiness
making
the
tastesmell
combo
very
memorable
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
a
small
bitter
finish
there
is
a
brief
lingering
aftertaste
before
the
final
farewell
this
is
like
the
last
kiss
of
summer
before
the
bleakness
of
winter

one
of
my
favorite
marzens
in
my
notes
i
wrote
this
is
a
damned
lovely
beer
after
my
first
sip
and
nothing
i
tasted
all
the
way
down
to
the
very
last
bit
of
foam
made
me
wish
to
change
my
opinion

you
want
to
go
out

fairly
light

this
is
one
of
the
very
best
if
not
the
very
best
oktoberfest
ive
ever
had
stellar
in
every
way
a
tome
for
the
style
highly
recommended
the

nebulous

slightly

the

was

smell
the
taste
was
of
malts
and
yeast
that
was
some
what
creamy
smooth
not
sweet
as
i
thought
very
little
bitterness
on
the
after
taste
overall
was
not
impressed
a
first
time
encounter
with
a
tart
note
and
vegies
with
any
oktoberfest
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
bottle
is
past

prime
this

along

breadlike
malt
dominates
the
palate
along
with
a
malty
sweetness
hops
are
along
for
the
ride
but
struggle
to
hang
on
showing
themselves
occasionally
spicy
alcohol
and
a
seperate
spicy
character
are
present
in
the
background
grainy
and
sweet
dry

this
is
a
bit
aggressive
for
a
märzen
thats
part
of
what
makes
it
good
although
i
did
find
the
alcohol
presence
to
be
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
still
great
to
sit
down
with
a
halfliter
or
better
yet
a
liter
of
dry
woody
hops
carry
through
finshes
with
an
apple
grape
dare
i
say
it
bouquet
it
is
a
mellow
oktoberfest
a
good
choice
to
introduce
a
novice
but
unique

for
a
ba
orange

fall
like
in
color
a
really
nice
appearance
inviting
to
the
eye
a
mild
tone
of
caramel
eclipses
everything
else
that
could
make
strong
appearances
in
the
overall
aroma
if
given
the
chance
an
excellent
body
that
is
both
smooth
and
lively
pours
with
a
nice
head
a
very
rich
and
ingrained
malt
presence
dominates
every
aspect
of
this
beer
a
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
spicy
touch
and
metallic
tinge
finishes
crisp
quaffable
is
not
the
best
word
to
describe
it
but
it
is
definitely
friendly
to
drink
a
very
light
orangish
amber
perhaps
the
lightest
oktoberfest
i
have
sampled
from
germany
the
head
is
full
and
rocky
lingering
appropriately
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
for
the
style
i
think
a
more
upfront
malt
aroma
is
needed
the
taste
is
very
wellformed
malty
with
caramel
and
a
slight
hops

the
body
seems
a

this
is

are
rather
sweet

unremarkable

descriptor
i
would
use
for
the
taste
as

the

beautiful

with
an
initial
thick
frothy
head
that
doesnt

around
for
long
the
aroma
is
light

somewhat
a

with
bready
undertones
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
comes
out
nicely
with
a
touch
of
bread
and
light
metallic
twinges
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
is
there
but
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
to
create
the
clean
crisp
german
character
i
am
used
to
with
this
style
i
could
still
swig
my
share
this
season
pours
a
cloudy
orange
amber
with
a
decent
frothy
rocky
white
headwith
good
retention
on

the
aromas
are
hard
to
pick
out
perhaps
a
touch
of
orange
peels
hints
of
spices
and
biscuits
on
the
palate

i
still
enjoyed
this

topped
with

aroma
is
extremely
sweet
with
an
almost
orange
tang
to

some

bite
to
offer
a
slight
balance
to
the
malt
sweetness
but
it
is
far
too
cloying
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
depth
to
the

too

some

no

with
some
toffee
tones
and
just
a
touch
of
bittering
that
breaks
in
to
attenuate
the
flavor
close
maybe
a
touch
more
hops
are
in
order
but
this
stuff
was
tasty
to
me
decent
body
full
but
not
at
all
sticky
good
drinkability
this
seems
to
be
ayings
lowest
rated
beer
which
is
only
testament
to
the
overall
quality
of
their
brews
if
you
ask
me
this
beer
is
fantastic
hazy
deep
golden
lager
with
puffy
perfect
head
mild
aroma
with
malt
hints
and
mild
spices
this
is
a
mellow
example
of
a
fest
brew
quietly
malty
with
just
a
trace
of
the
typical
spices
crisp
hop
dryness
comes
at
the
end
forcing
you
to
take
another
sip
and
another
and
another
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
soft
puffy
and
gently
bubbly
tasty
cold
but
even
better
at
a
more
traditional
warmer
temperature
read
as
it
warms
in
your
liter
stein
this
beer
is
perfect
with
herb
roasted
chicken
with
a
nice
crispy
skin
actually
this
beer
would
be
perfect
with
just
about
anything
shouldnt
be
just
for
oktoberfest
but
easterfest
4thofjulyfest
and
breakfast
ok
im
done
raving
about
this
beer
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
really
loved
it
anyway

their

w

although
an
enjoyable
marzen
its
not
quite

complex
as
other
widely
available
imports
that
being
said
ill
take
it
over
most
microbrewed
versions
nice
body
but
i
think
the
hops
are
too
up
front
for
the
style
not
my
idea
of
oktoberfest
not
real
smooth
ill
pass
notes
oktoberfest
in
the
raw
seems
a
little
rushed
from
years
before
flavours
are
not
well
blended
and
out
of
whack
with
a
need
to
mellow
out
some
more
perhaps
the
yeast
strain
is
getting
a
little
stir
crazy
also
enough
of
the
babble
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
might
beer
hard
to
get
used
to
some
may
like
it
some
may
not
light
easy

octoberfest
low
on
flavor
o
ok
for

beer

a
bit

lightweight
for

octoberfest
not
nearly
malty
enough
for
me
in
this
style
as
far
as
this
style
is
concerned
this
beer
has
a
good
flavor
with
a

making
it
a

choice
for
those
who

and
very

to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
and
nice
example
of
the
style
as
well
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
orange
color
body
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
of
malts
and
that
is
all
i
detect
the
taste
has
that
nice
malt
flavor
upfront
followed
by
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
no
hops
are
present
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
marzen
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
defently
not
the
worst
o
a
decent
oktoberfest
a
bit
more
robust
that
some
ive
tried
sessionable

good
14

thinner
mouthfeel
designed
to
be
an
easy
drinbker
quite
sessionable
touch
cloying
not
a
hop
in
sight
good
not
great
though
i
had
right
after
the
hooker
octoberfest
and
this
was
clearly
inferior
to
that
one
its
a
good
standard
oktoberfest
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
will
drink
it
o
a
solid
oktoberfest
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
the
body
is
medium
with
a
biting
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
pretty
nice
smoothness
underneath
thats
dominated
by
a
crispness
that
bites
too
harshly
it
has
the
makings
of
something
that
could
be
good
but
is
too
heavily
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
if
you
like
a
sweet
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
which
would
be
good
for
a
cool
autumn
night
a
few
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
would
be
nice
but
i
can
not
complain
overall
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
nice
flavor
blend
give
it
a
go
if
you
have
a
chance
overall
this
one
is
strong
on
the
rye
bread
end
the
flavor
is
very
full
and
different
but
not
really
what
i
look
for
from
the
style
o
overall
its
a
nice
marzen
mostly
easy
drinking
like
it
should
be
much
better
ones
out
there
though
im
always
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
try
a
new
oktoberfest
and
stoudts
fits
the
bill
though
perhaps
not
quite
true
to
style
ill
have
to
drink
a
few
more
before
i
decide
where
is
ranks
with
other
onot
as
smooth
an
easy
to
drink
as
i
like
my
oktoberfest
beers
to
be
it
is
okay
though
just
off
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
compared
to
most
thanks
to
tone77
for
this
beer
o
this
is
one
oktoberfest
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
simple
tasty
and
highly
quaffable
a
great
example
of
the
style
everything
youre
looking
for
is
here
o
a
typical
bastardization
of
a
wonderful
style
by
stoudts
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
ever
had
i
wouldnt
choose
this
beer
over
others
that
i
would
consider
to
be
in
the
same
class
its
got
a
great
smell
and
above
average
taste
but
the
taste
really
isnt
special
for
a
craft
beer
and
the
look
and
feel
just
arent
quite
there
for
me
its
almost
there
but
its
lack
of
unique
character
just
doesnt
help
this
beer
make
the
cut
marzens
generally
go
by
the
book
and
this
isnt
too
much
different
than
most
not
too
sweet
but
pleasantly
so
a
little
biscuit
differentiates
it
from
some
others
o
this
is
a
really
good
oktoberfest
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
but
very
drinkable
none
the
less
o
this
isnt
a
bad
marzen
but
its
not
an
overly
good
one
this
is
an
average
beer
which
i
find
rather
surprising
because
i
have
praised
some
of
stoudts
other
lagers
obviously
this
is
better
than
the
mickeys
and
yuengling
which
slightly
higher
or
similar
marks
from
me
but
based
as
an
oktoberfest
it
is
lacking
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
sausage
sandwich
on
a
nice
fall
day
overall
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
its
very
average
i
dont
think
i
would
have
another
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
spices
taste
is
rather
mild
malts
a
touch
of
spice
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
had
better
oktoberfests
not
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
out
there
i
usually
like
stuff
from
stoudts
but
this
one
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
dnot
a
bad
beer
but
i
really
would
like
a
stronger
malt
presence
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
and
leaves
a
good
film
on
the
inside
of
your
mouth
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
a
better
than
average
oktoberfest
that
is
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
smooth
not
worth
seeking
out
but
glad
i
picked
this
up
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bold
gold
with
thin
head
an
no
lace
the
aroma
is
caramel
nuts
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
has
notes
of
caramel
orange
and
spice
mainly
ginger
a
tiny
bit
of
root
beer
shows
up
in
the
finish
its
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
stoudts
oktober
fest
is
a
good
beer
dry
and
refreshing
a
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
o
a
nice
beer
for
when
you
just
want
something
simple
that
you
dont
have
to
overanalyze
what
youre
drinking
medium
bodied
with
a
prominent
autumnal
spice
character
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
dry
finish
slight
crisp
hop
presence
compliments
the
spices
but
doesnt
overpower
not
bitter
sweet
malt
backbone
is
kind
of
watered
down
with
caramel
toffee
and
nut
mediocre
overall
not
true
to
style
and
lacks
any
striking
traits
but
it
is
clean
and
easy
to
drink
o
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
12
head
that
dissipates
to
a
lace
that
follows
down
the
beer
really
nice
rich
amber
color
a
malty
smell
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
fruitiness
not
as
crisp
as
i
prefer
but
very
drinkable
overall
another
nice
beverage
from
stoudts
i
havent
been
disappointed
yet
o
this
is
a
respectable
presentation
of
the
fall
classic
but
definitely
not
a
must
have
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
overall
it
was
a
very
decent
oktoberfest
and
very
drinkable
nice
going
stoudts
o
the
smell
and
flavor
were
a
bit
mild
with
this
one
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
moreys
bottom
line
super
drinkable
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
not
quite
as
good
as
great
lakes
it
starts
out
that
way
but
it
just
doesnt
finish
like
glo
does
o
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
very
interesting
retro
looking
label
on
this
one
poured
into
my
geordie
schooner
nice
thick
head
on
a
dark
copper
base
head
lasted
quite
awhile
aroma
was
maltamania
tons
of
malty
sweetness
both
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
not
much
in
the
hops
department
just
a
regular
basic
malty
octoberfest
would
like
to
try
on
tap
my
first
from
stoudts
amberhue
foamy
head
with
gobs
of
retention
bubbling
carbonation
nose
is
clean
if
not
malty
taste
is
sweet
bready
and
finishes
with
light
grass
and
flower
more
balanced
than
many
marzens
ive
had
drinkable
a
much
fuller
body
than
many
marzens
ive
tried
this
year
nice
terrible
rendition
of
an
oktoberfest
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
offer
enough
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
this
beer
is
very
light
and
sessionable
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
not
very
complex
either
a
very
nicely
malted
nose
leads
the
mouth
into
a
beautiful
harmony
of
flavor
and
drinkability
i
had
to
stop
myself
from
finishing
a
whole
sixer
in
an
hours
time
it
just
goes
down
so
nicely
but
not
in
that
way
where
you
dont
notice
every
sip
makes
me
happy
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
over
a
descent
interpretation
of
the
marzen
i
could
easily
drink
many
but
as
far
as
innovation
and
character
go
i
would
say
just
a
touch
on
the
bland
and
unexciting
side
o
not
that
great
of
a
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
or
flavor
i
thought
maybe
it
was
last
years
beer
but
the
best
by
date
is
012012
i
definately
wont
be
buying
this
game
again
a
bit
early
for
the
oktoberfests
but
i
could
definitely
drink
lots
of
this
in
a
few
weeks
a
very
enjoyable
brew
o
my
first
bottle
from
this
batch
i
was
a
little
disappointed
but
the
more
i
have
this
beer
the
more
i
enjoy
it
although
its
not
extravagant
in
any
way
its
a
damn
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
what
the
standard
of
commercial
beer
should
be
overall
im
not
all
that
impressed
this
was
ok
i
hate
to
judge
a
stoudts
offering
on
only
a
single
bottle
ill
buy
one
fresh
and
revisit
having
had
this
before
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
giving
it
an
honest
review
and
truthfully
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
enjoyable
its
very
true
to
the
style
which
stoudts
seems
to
do
quite
well
i
really
look
forward
to
this
beer
in
the
fall
but
its
still
wonderful
now
pours
a
translucent
dark
golden
brown
with
maybe
12
finger
of
head
nice
carbonation
rising
throughout
smell
is
faint
slightly
sweet
smelling
malts
but
nothing
more
distinct
than
that
tastes
like
a
lager
but
not
in
the
marzen
style
crisp
and
pretty
clean
but
taste
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
high
carbonation
level
too
much
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
okay
but
not
at
all
memorable
this
oktoberfest
isnt
too
bad
the
pour
is
nice
the
head
rises
but
didnt
overflow
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
color
the
head
is
cream
colored
the
aroma
is
slightly
spicy
with
some
good
malts
on
the
nose
too
the
flavor
is
pretty
standard
for
most
marzen
style
its
earthy
with
a
little
spice
with
some
sweeter
malts
in
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
on
this
brew
if
it
was
a
bit
heavier
it
would
have
probably
been
better
tasty
oktoberfest
with
nothing
spectacular
but
tasty
allaround
from
fall
brew
ranking
notes
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
but
almost
no
head
a
bit
of
lacing
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
nose
was
a
pleasant
maltiness
carried
by
the
lively
carbonation
hint
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
mouthfeel
was
also
pleasant
heavy
but
carried
by
the
nice
carbonation
good
mix
didnt
weight
you
down
and
the
carbonation
didnt
pull
the
beer
from
your
tongue
taste
was
dominated
by
the
toasty
caramel
malts
there
was
a
touch
of
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
round
the
taste
out
but
nothing
getting
in
the
way
of
the
reserved
and
simply
drinkable
taste
pretty
above
average
in
every
way
not
the
top
of
the
line
for
this
style
but
a
really
solid
attempt
overall
a
pretty
hoppy
version
of
the
style
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
back
it
up
lacking
the
smoothness
of
a
good
lager
still
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
i
thought
i
could
count
on
stoudts
to
come
up
with
a
solid
authentic
marzen
but
instead
this
tastes
decidedly
like
a
maibock
it
even
looks
like
a
maibock
in
color
a
light
yellowyamber
with
a
faint
haze
looks
pretty
flat
as
far
as
carbonation
theres
some
maltiness
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
uncharacteristic
hoppiness
and
spiciness
as
well
as
far
as
the
nature
of
the
spiciness
its
a
tossup
between
whether
or
not
its
derived
from
the
yeast
which
could
be
lending
the
fruity
notes
too
or
from
the
specialty
grain
the
malt
in
the
flavor
once
again
having
a
rye
bent
to
it
and
body
is
of
moderate
concentration
the
apparent
deficit
of
co2
in
the
form
of
visual
foam
and
bubbles
as
previously
noted
can
be
detected
as
well
in
the
smooth
yet
surprisingly
watery
feel
ya
boring
whats
up
stoudts
db
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
flavor
fairly
standard
for
yhe
style
but
enjoyable
without
any
major
flaws
drinkability
for
the
märzen
style
it
is
sudued
and
not
overly
prounounced
but
in
general
the
very
light
hop
notes
complement
the
mellow
taste
d
good
session
brew
clean
and
drinkable
but
doesnt
stand
out
good
moderately
full
body
given
the
low
abv
im
surprised
at
how
heavy
this
feels
this
is
really
a
secretlyfull
beer
great
beer
thats
full
of
flavor
lots
of
tasty
breadiness
finished
with
a
kiss
of
sweetness
nice
grainy
aftertaste
this
really
is
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
season
great
flavor
excellent
drinkability
just
tweak
the
nose
a
bit
and
this
is
stellar
md
on
the
thinner
side
seemed
watered
down
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
was
a
let
down
for
me
will
reach
for
other
beers
in
this
style
in
the
future
d
its
a
light
drinkable
beer
but
not
worth
craft
brew
money
in
my
opinion
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
bottle
slightly
better
i
drank
quite
a
few
of
these
at
the
german
american
oktoberfest
i
was
at
but
that
is
mostly
because
the
only
other
beers
offered
were
spaten
if
they
had
offered
a
better
authentic
german
marzen
i
think
i
would
have
taken
it
over
this
but
it
was
still
a
darn
tasty
beer
it
also
went
great
with
my
massive
sausage
platter
d
the
beer
isnt
very
difficult
to
drink
i
would
consider
trying
this
again
because
it
was
an
unusual
interpretation
of
the
style
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
color
is
medium
orange
with
a
2
finger
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
bisquity
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
light
finish
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
moderate
carbontation
and
it
drinks
very
easy
not
best
in
classbut
a
solid
marzen
another
fine
product
from
stoudts
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
an
early
slight
cool
autumn
day
despite
the
low
abv
the
overall
sweetness
may
keep
this
one
from
being
truly
sessionable
still
an
excellent
lager
d
pretty
good
basic
example
of
the
style
refreshing
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
wouldnt
mind
celebrating
oktoberfest
with
a
few
of
these
taste
is
crisp
and
creamy
with
a
nice
finish
its
got
some
toffee
notes
with
a
light
hop
presence
very
drinkable
clear
light
orange
brew
gives
a
thin
bubbly
offwhite
head
nose
is
pretty
faint
but
nicely
complex
a
little
spice
florals
hops
malt
etc
taste
is
much
more
forward
fairly
hoppy
with
a
moderate
marzentype
body
a
tiny
bit
of
acidic
bite
carbo
a
bit
too
fizzy
pours
copper
and
a
half
finger
head
nice
bready
malt
with
a
very
light
hop
bitterness
smooth
yet
bubbley
on
the
mouth
drinking
is
pretty
much
on
on
par
with
other
mazens
fits
style
but
isnt
anything
special
the
write
home
about
if
i
was
from
pa
it
would
be
good
this
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
with
minimal
lacing
i
got
a
lot
of
sweet
malty
bread
off
the
nose
with
the
signature
lager
aroma
off
the
nose
it
is
right
in
line
with
the
style
and
gets
me
excited
for
the
season
the
carbonation
on
this
one
is
very
strong
maintaining
itself
as
i
finished
the
glass
very
smooth
and
fresh
to
taste
with
the
grains
taking
the
forefront
but
not
aggressively
so
the
hops
add
just
the
slightest
bitterness
to
finish
it
out
as
it
should
be
this
oktoberfest
is
clean
fully
flavored
and
extremely
drinkable
im
glad
i
still
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
quite
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
plenty
of
flavor
traditional
and
all
around
good
poured
a
cider
color
creamy
white
head
good
head
retention
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
weak
consisting
of
caramel
and
sweet
toffee
taste
had
mainly
caramel
and
toffee
it
was
a
little
bitter
at
times
but
well
done
nice
subtle
cocoa
notes
on
the
finish
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
is
a
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
nice
crispness
nice
malts
and
marzen
lager
flavors
and
aromas
some
nice
grassy
hop
additions
the
flavor
comes
a
little
light
for
me
but
overall
nice
no
off
flavors
either
so
they
did
a
good
job
lagering
nice
session
drinker
d
this
was
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
i
almost
wish
they
made
year
round
i
would
be
trading
for
this
all
the
time
if
that
was
the
case
a
great
drinking
beer
drinkability
is
phenomenal
perfect
balance
great
flavor
excellent
mouthfeel
beautiful
beer
d
excellent
drinkability
smooth
and
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
the
full
flavors
make
it
a
good
drinking
brew
im
glad
i
revisited
this
one
as
its
an
elite
octoberfest
in
my
opinion
its
fresh
and
loaded
with
a
balanced
rich
maltiness
and
biting
finish
delicious
seems
a
touch
thin
in
the
mouth
but
comes
across
as
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
i
measure
my
american
ofests
against
samuel
adams
and
this
one
falls
short
transparent
orange
with
white
bubbly
head
sweets
smell
of
sugar
slight
grains
cereal
honey
and
some
floral
notes
flavors
of
cereal
honey
floral
notes
slight
oranges
and
tang
in
the
aftertaste
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
a
bland
octoberfest
worth
trying
but
not
the
best
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
layers
the
tongue
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
typical
oktoberfest
way
too
hoppy
compared
to
a
traditional
marzen
in
my
opinion
the
brewer
pushed
the
enevelope
a
little
too
far
almost
to
the
point
where
it
no
longer
fits
the
style
that
said
its
still
enjoyable
but
if
you
want
something
more
traditional
look
elsewhere
good
interpretation
of
the
style
stoudts
knocks
some
beer
out
of
the
park
unfortunately
oktober
fest
isnt
one
of
them
brewing
outside
the
box
is
fine
for
some
styles
but
this
one
works
better
if
it
stays
closer
to
the
triedandtrue
i
know
its
getting
near
the
end
of
its
fridge
life
but
this
one
let
me
down
although
it
seems
to
have
smoothed
out
since
the
fall
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
bready
sweet
marzen
but
it
seems
like
we
want
to
hop
everything
up
beyond
recognition
these
days
d
very
good
drinkability
good
example
of
the
marzen
style
id
go
for
this
one
again
over
all
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
my
favorite
for
an
oktoberfest
d
d
i
dont
often
reach
for
ofests
so
maybe
my
assesment
is
off
this
just
seemed
pretty
far
removed
from
what
is
tradtional
for
the
style
that
doesnt
usualy
matter
much
to
me
but
it
did
bother
me
with
this
one
notes
stoudts
has
an
extremely
drinkable
crisp
body
and
nice
simple
flavor
that
i
could
drink
plenty
of
with
some
soft
sour
dough
pretzels
and
mustard
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
yes
i
would
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
adamstown
along
with
a
big
freshfromtheoven
soft
pretzel
pours
a
golden
amber
color
1
finger
of
frothy
white
head
minimal
retention
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
and
a
faint
spicing
and
hoppy
background
nice
to
see
some
of
the
toasty
whiffs
in
there
taste
is
a
a
balanced
profile
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
like
the
smell
there
is
a
faint
spice
and
hoppy
finnish
medium
bodied
slightly
chewy
good
carbonation
good
representation
of
the
style
with
a
little
more
dark
roasted
malts
than
others
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
ofest
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
d
i
enjoyed
my
first
stoudts
experience
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
in
liter
mugs
its
one
of
my
more
favorite
oktoberfests
this
season
it
has
a
complex
and
delicate
malt
and
hop
balance
that
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
goes
down
very
nicely
d
way
too
sweet
and
yeasty
for
me
i
only
had
a
4oz
snifter
full
and
poured
the
rest
down
the
drain
a
decent
drink
nothing
worth
seeking
out
for
the
holiday
drinkability
i
seen
that
there
was
only
one
6
pack
of
this
left
so
i
figured
alot
of
people
must
have
liked
this
and
were
scooping
it
up
fast
not
my
favorite
october
ive
tried
but
it
has
alot
of
characteristics
to
make
it
a
decent
try
very
drinkable
i
can
throw
back
a
hell
of
alot
of
these
in
a
short
period
of
time
the
malt
was
overly
sweet
for
my
palate
and
the
body
a
bit
too
light
but
otherwise
this
a
solid
drinking
ofest
d
a
very
refreshing
oktoberfest
would
drink
it
if
i
could
get
it
around
here

flavor

pretty
drinkable

drinkability
a
disappointing
example
of
the
style
i
usually
enjoy
stoudts
but
this
oktoberfest
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
its
even
5
0
which
means
i
can
enjoy
a
few
more
without
getting
too
intoxicated
this
sixer
was

at
my
local
good
beer
store
which
seemed
a
bit
steep
other
stoudts
product
nonimperialdouble
sell
for
9
99
a
bit
expensive
i
felt
but
still
a
good
brew
even
mouthfeel
full
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
tingly
tasty
and
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
not
a
bad
marzen
stoudts
produces
some
quality
easy
drinking
brews
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
ive
had
better
marzens
but
this
one
is
good
and
i
would
reach
for
it
again
again
just
alright
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
example
id
love
to
drink
it
out
of
a
glass
boot
poured
from
a
bottle
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
yelloworange
transparent
body
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
smell
was
weak
a
faint
smell
of
spices
and
malts
taste
followed
the
smell
pretty
thin
and
not
a
lot
going
on
gets
a
little
stronger
as
it
warms
up
but
still
not
much
happening
very
drinkable
beer
though
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
orange
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
aroma
is
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
mild
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
more
sweet
malts
with
subdued
earthy
hops
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
the
first
chilly
day
in
nc
in
at
least
3
months
this
is
a
very
respectable
oktoberfest
d
high
this
style
is
meant
to
be
drunk
in
good
volume
and
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
up
to
that
task
this
ones
pretty
spot
on
for
style
not
too
sweet
toasty
malts
and
a
slight
bite
noble
hops
perhaps
this
may
be
my
favorite
american
oktoberfest
beer
goes
down
super
easy
like
and
oktoberfest
beer
should
has
some
really
nice
subtle
nuances
for
a
low
abv
beer
my
only
stroke
against
it
is
that
it
is
slightly
over
carbonated
for
the
style
but
that
being
said
this
is
a
marked
improvement
in
the
domestic
oktoberfest
line
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
plus
some
woodiness
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
bland
it
tastes
a
little
like
its
been
watered
down
medium
body
also
feels
like
its
on
the
watery
side

a
very
sessionable
oktoberfest
from
stoudts
but
a
bit
too
light
for
my
tastes
a
great
seasonal
brew
for
the
price
2
of
these
after
a
day
of
work
was
just
about
perfect
it
was
an
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
but
there
wasnt
much
to
it
i
dont
expect
much
out
of
a
oktoberfest
but
a
little
more
of
anything
would
have
been
nice
would
i
drink
it
again
i
might
because
i
like
stoudts
not
one
of
their
best
beers
but
at
least
its
drinkable
if
you
like
crispy
german
style
lagers
then
you
should
probably
try
this
one
stoudts
octoberfest
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mild
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
the
flavor
is
also
malty
with
a
biscuit
like
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
noticeable
hops
that
balance
out
the
flavor
decent
worth
a
try
do
an
easytodrink
yet
rather
tame
interpretation
of
the
style
a
nice
yearround
lager
with
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hop
but
there
are
better
bolder
american
märzens
out
there
drinkability
is
awesome
you
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
night
its
a
great
ofest
beer
md
the
carbonation
may
have
been
a
little
high
but
it
did
not
really
detract
from
the
beer
it
was
crisp
smooth
dry
and
left
a
nice
aftertaste
the
sixpack
was
gone
quickly
this
one
will
be
a
staple
this
fall
season
very
nice
drinkable
beer
there
are
plenty
of
ofests
out
there
that
are
much
better
but
this
one
is
very
simple
and
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
poured
a
clear
coppery
amber
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
little
retention
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
toasted
grain
caramel
earth
and
spicy
hops
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
grainy
malt
caramel
and
bread
crust
with
a
spicy
and
earthy
hop
finish
medium
in
body
and
moderately
high
in
carbonation
grainy
but
smooth
and
buttery
with
a
metallic
finish
id
give
it
a
try
again
but
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
this
one
this
time
around
d
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
its
easy
to
drink
i
just
think
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
d
good
beer
and
a
nice
session
brew
a
sixer
would
be
perfect
for
the
hockey
game
d
an
admirable
offering
in
the
oktoberfest
style
but
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
when
the
whole
package
is
considered
dquite
possibly
the
best
oktobefest
iv
had
in
2008
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
very
thin
white
head
with
light
retention
and
no
lacing
lots
of
toasted
and
carmelized
malt
aromas
that
mix
with
noble
hops
again
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
with
some
vanilla
mix
nicely
with
a
muted
hoppy
finish
low
carb
medium
body
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
beer
overall
not
bad
at
all
though
it
was
entirely
forgettable
this
will
most
certainly
not
go
down
in
my
list
of
favorites
for
the
season
by
any
means
it
was
just
too
little
with
not
enough
character
oh
well
onto
the
next
one
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
by
the
flavor
of
this
marzen
but
its
well
balanced
and
really
doesnt
have
any
off
flavors
to
speak
of
you
might
be
wise
to
pick
up
a
different
brewers
version
which
is
surprising
given
stoudts
track
record
after
spending
8
99
for
a
sixpack
i
was
disappointed
light
in
color
and
body
lacking
any
distinctive
taste
surely
not
of
the
true
marzen
style
taste
mediocre
alcohol
kick
sorely
missing
particularly
for
the
style
definitely
a
step
down
from
other
stoudts
products
d
great
drinkability
i
think
im
going
to
grab
a
case
before
oktoberfest
if
over
overall
a
good
beer
but
too
americanized
not
sweet
enough
and
a
little
too
hoppy
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
produced
oktoberfest
that
is
worth
a
shot
pours
a
copper
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
and
a
very
nice
lace
aroma
is
grainy
and
buttery
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
has
some
nice
spices
up
front
with
a
rich
bread
and
butter
finish
some
hints
of
honey
make
this
a
really
enjoyable
brew
bottle
artwork

white

by
a

in
octoberfest
gear
great
bottle
a
bit
thin
but
overall
a
nice
easydrinking
interpretation
of
a
tradional
ofest
poured
a
light
brown
color
with
no
head
smelled
of
light
watery
malts
the
taste
was
a
typical
oktoberfest
some
malts
a
spices
all
around
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
stood
out
ill
pass
next
time
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
stoudts
a
light
refreshing
drinkable
brew
but
nonetooimpressive
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
low
in
alcohol
for
an
oktoberfestmärzen
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
but
lacks
some
of
the
proper
character
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
it
is
not
much
in
the
category
of
oktoberfests
but
it
is
a
great
german
style
nonetheless
d
overall
this
beer
did
nothing
for
me
there
was
something
about
the
taste
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
there
really
arent
a
lot
of
off
flavors
to
slow
you
down
an
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
very
balanced
and
pleasant
this
is
yet
another
fantastic
lager
from
stoudts
all
kinds
of
balance
flavor
and
satisfaction
highly
recommended
d
the
taste
kind
of
grew
on
me
as
i
neared
the
end
of
the
glass
and
i
wouldve
had
another
if
i
wouldve
bought
more
than
1
bottle
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
no
head
aromas
that
are
earthy
and
a
bit
cidery
same
in
the
taste
a
bit
cidery
but
not
big
in
a
fruit
presence
and
dry
a
clean
aftertaste
somewhat
refreshing
prefect
for
a
nice
warm
fall
evening
i
might
have
to
get
a
case
for
halloween
d
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
or
all
oktoberfests
but
enjoyable
drinkability
is
very
good
i
like
this
take
on
the
classic
oktoberfest
another
great

from
stoudts
fairly
drinkable
not
bad

the
style
mouthfeel

dmouthfeel
creamy

with

overall
decent
beer
but
only
slightly
average
for
its
style
with
slightly
average
flavor
this
is
an
easy
drinking
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
waaaay
too
fast
a
good

pretty
true
to
the
style

thin

moderate

smells
fruity
and
lightly

it
tastes
fruitier
than
other
marzens
ive
had
and
the
fruit
kind
of
hides
the
malt
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
for
the
style
and
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
certainly
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
though
ive
had
better
oktoberfests
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
d
a
decent
session
beer
many
at
the
party
myself
included
enjoyed
the
beer
i
liked
it
although
probably
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brew
d
good
beer
all
around
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
solid
d
a
good
session
beer
solid
example
of
the
style
rates
comparably
to
other
oktoberfests
d
super
easy
to

and
representative
of
the
oktoberfest
style
d

overly

here

there

i
feel
like
someone
put
dried
out
leaves
right
in
my
beer
and
the
aftertaste
is
really
staying
with
me
nutty
as
well
man
talk
about
a
fall
time
brew
seeing
as
how
i
am
in
the
middle
of
august
i
feel
like
it
might
be
a
bit
early
to
be
having
such
a
seasonal
beer
feel
has
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
liquid
is
pretty
well
bodied
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
interested
in
the
style
definitely
try
this
one
out
pretty
interesting
i
have
to
say
drinkability
is
there
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
dark
or
flavorful
as
i
figured
they
would
go
far
not
a
bad
brew
in
the
wide
picture
of
things
but
not
quite
the
quality
that
i
expect
from
stoudts
light
bodied
compaired
to
most
ofest
ive
tried
with
a
bit
of
grainyness
pleasinggoes
down
smootha
sessionable
ofest
wish
i
had
another
a
very
good
beer
overall
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
bisquit
malt
scent
its
semisweet
with
a
dry
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
malty
flavor
thats
full
of
pale
and
bisquit
malts
there
is
a
light
sweetness
to
it
other
than
that
its
quite
simple
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
although
there
are
plenty
of
better
choices
on
the
market

and
fairly

there
is
some
initial

by
some

is
a

appears
in

clean

crisp
with
just
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
seems
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
but
at
times
seems
a
bit
slick
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
seems
more
like
a
vienna
lager
than
a
marzen
in
appearance
and
body
this
is
an
enjoyable
fall
seasonal
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
other
than
the
body
and
the
appearance
this
is
a
nice
marzen
the
flavor
is
good
with
interesting
differences
that
give
this
beer
character
d
was
talked
into
buying
a
case
at
the
beer
store
and
am
not
disappointed
not
the
strongest
ofest
i
have
had
but
easily
drinkable
and
tasty
easily
sessionable
esp
in
the
cooler
months
i
e
october
pours
a
medium
amber
with
bright
gold
highlights
and
a
dusting
of
a
head
perfect
clarity
aromas
of
buttery
amber
malts
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
that
i
assume
is
hopderived
on
the
palate
mild
bitterness
at
the
first
then
things
turn
biscuity
and
a
tad
sweet
balance
remains
though
with
some
nicely
scratchy
hop
notes
asserting
themselves
as
balance
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
aside
from
the
pleasant
hop
oils
while
carbonation
is
spoton
for
the
style
this
is
a
well
done
oktoberfest
marzen
beer
good
the
feel
is
spicy
on
the
tongue
mediumbodied
but
milky
as
it
warms
up
leaves
a
light
pleasant
film
overall
its
really
a
terrific
brew
a
fresher
smoother
version
of
the
typical
oktoberfest
stoudts
brings
something
a
little
different
to
the
marzen
style
with
the
hop
bitterness
of
this
guy
and
i
rather
like
it
besides
my
issues
with
the
body
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
tasty
and
easy
drinking
octoberfest
id
call
this
a
nice
americanstyle
oktoberfest
in
that
this
is
a
nice
smooth
lager
but
the
caramel
malts
have
a
roasted
edge
to
them
theres
a
nice
malty
aroma
and
taste
but
it
lacks
the
subtlety
of
a
great
amber
lager
still
a
solid
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
the
traditional
american
ofest
recommended
overall
a
different
kind
of
oktoberfest
beer
to
me
the
taste
is
fine
not
a
great
balance
between
maltshops
but
certainly
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
tough
though
with
an
offkey
bitter
tingling
d
this
is
a
classic
example
of
an
ofest
but
it
has
a
little
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
despite
low
reviews
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
example
for
the
style
its
a
tasty
drinkable
german
lager
i
bought
a
case
of
this
last
year
and
remember
it
being
better
than
this
i
dont
know
if
it
changed
or
if
my
memory
is
skewed
but
this
is
an
average
oktoberfest
its
disappointing
because
i
really
like
stoudts
and
was
expecting
better
here
maybe
they
just
need
to
change
the
name
back
to
fest
because
that
doesnt
imply
that
its
an
oktoberfest
but
rather
just
a
fall
seasonal
or
they
need
a
subtitle
that
says
its
not
true
to
the
style
because
it
really
isnt
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
stoudts
can
do
so
much
better
disappointing
poured
into
a
tulip
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
amber
brown
head
was
an
off
white
foam
that
lingered
around
the
edges
aroma
smelled
like
sweet
dark
bread
tasted
like
a
sweet
oaty
bread
felt
slighty
carbonated
in
the
mouth
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
i
would
drink
many
of
at
once
not
bad
as
with
the
other
oktoberfests
ive
been
sampling
lately
this
example
has
its
subtleties
stoudts
has
a
certain
tanginess
to
it
the
grain
is
a
bit
more
toasted
and
husky
here
but
it
is
nonetheless
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
very
disappointed
with
this
one
stoudts
is
usually
pretty
solid
but
this
years
oktoberfest
seems
to
be
dumbed
down
amber
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
lace
mild
smell
with
a
hop
character
and
some
nice
nutty

notes

taste
with
nutty
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
malt
a
little
bread
and
some
stinky
german
hops

big

very
very
high

this
cool

ill
be
drinking
more
than
one
bring
on
some
football
at
least
games
that
count
another
nice
brew
for
a
great
brewery
stoudts
i
must
say
this
beer
is
much
better
than
last
years
last
years
batch
was
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
this
pours
a
nice
oftbrown
color
with
a
nice
large
head
very
nutty
on
the
nose
with
some
nice
bittering
hops
at
the
end
keeping
the
brew
dry
which
i
love
very
malty
and
toasty
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
nice
dark
orange
head
creamy
lace
around
the
glasses
malty
smell
offset
by
slight
alcohol
tendencies
goes
down
really
well
slightly
sweet
but
offset
by
spice
and
warmth
of
subtle
hop
and
alcohol
smooth
drinking
great
for
a
warmup
in
the
cold
when
the
fall
comes
much
bettter
than
other
versions
ive
had
they
stuck
to
the
proper
recipe
and
made
it
their
own
i
dont
like
the
finishing
sensation
with
this
beer
and
generally
dont
find
enough
else
positive
in
it
to
balance
out
this
negative
poured
into
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
beer
had
a
nice
brown
rich
color
and
smelled
yummy
of
nuts
and
pumpkin
good
head
that
oozed
that
smell
right
into
your
olfactory
glands
and
made
you
want
to
gulp
it
right
away

was
a
great
beer

like
a
bock
to
me
i
will
certainly
purchase
again

und

wohl

i
was
thirsty
for
a
brew
so
perhaps
any
beer
would
have
tasted
amazing
right
now
but
this
really
hit
the
spot
bham
uk
by
far
the
best
octoberfest
that
i
have
had
this
year
this
is
a
drinking
beer
with
flavor
recommended
i
liked
this
one
its
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
in
a
while
definitely
worth
a
shot
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
was
colored
a
dark
honey
color
and
poured
a
thin
but
nice
head
it
was
fairly
light
bodied
and
had
a
spicy
flavor
to
it
which
i
quite
enjoyed
along
with
the
spice
flavor
malt
was
there
and
subtle
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
selection
one
of
the
better
american
oktoberfests
beers
i
have
had
yet
but
not
great
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
others
and
i
plan
on
looking
for
other
stoudt
beers
this
was
a
disappointment
looked
good
with
a
light
amber
color
very
modest
head
but
good
carbonation
initial
impression
was
okay
just
something
i
wouldnt
want
another
of
after
that
it
was
all
downhill
taste
was
dismal
and
left
an
alltogether
unpleasant
aftertaste
this
oktoberfest
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
of
the
ones
ive
tried
this
year
this
one
hits
closest
to
the
mark
of
what
i
consider
a
great
marzen
oktoberfest
plenty
of
body
good
mouthfeel
and
higherthanaverage
drinkability
just
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
and
the
hops
are
there
although
not
too
present
right
on
style
imo
and
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
refreshing
definitely
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
drinkability
light
and
simple
so
you
know
thats
cool
if
thats
your
thing
me
ill
stick
to
other
examples
of
the
style
or
better
yet
stoudts
other
beers
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
gorgeous
crystal
clear
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
while
nose
is
caramel
grainy
malt
and
a
slight
vegetal
note
nothing
too
impressive
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
excellent
a
nice
full
doughy
malt
slightly
nutty
with
a
nice
gentle
touch
of
hops
to
finish
things
out
so
smooth
and
creamy
so
delicious
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
suberb
oktoberfest
seek
this
one
out
if
you
can
find
it
low
to
medium
bodied
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
surely
worth
looking
for
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
although
that
aroma
is
pretty
foul
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
a
decent
oktoberfest
overall
not
great
but
not
horrible
definitely
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
brew
worth
a
shot
but
not
anything
id
seek
out
oh
well
8
49
6pack
m
d
definately
a
smooth
beer
but
for
me
pretty
much
only
drinkable
in
the
fall
when
it
reflects
the
season
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
not
as
bad
as
last
years
beer
poured
a
nice
coppery
color
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
smell
was
fresh
hard
to
describe
nothing
really
jumping
out
as
a
dominating
smell
taste
was
the
same
tasted
good
but
no
distinguishing
characteristics
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
another
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
lively
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
the
only
conisistent
thought
going
through
my
head
while
i
was
drinking
this
was
that
it
is
fresh
not
impressed
but
not
a
bad
beer
would
rather
try
another
oktoberfest
than
this
one
translucent
copper
color
with
lacy
white
foam
the
head
is
thick
with
a
soapy
porous
texture
some
malt
aromas
can
be
detected
but
faint
and
not
much
else
alcohol
and
malt
flavors
are
upfront
with
a
dry
malt
mediumbodied
aftertaste
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
flavorful
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
one
has
the
potential
to
be
a
solid
oktoberfest
beer
but
unfourtunatly
it
doesnt
shine
through
like
it
should
its
not
bad
but
id
rather
go
for
a
sam
adams
ofest
and
i
never
thought
id
have
to
choose
sa
over
stoudts
hmmm
this
is
my
second
offering
from
stoudts
and
im
really
impressed
one
of
the
better
ofests
i
have
tried
so
far
this
year
poured
a
dare
i
say
orange
hed
brown
no
head
and
it
appears
almost
flat
but
i
still
really
liked
the
color
of
this
beer
nose
is
quite
pleasanlty
of
just
slightly
toasted
malts
taste
is
simple
and
straightforward
not
lots
of
anything
just
some
pleasant
toasted
grains
hops
just
barely
register
this
is
how
i
see
an
oktoberfest
tasting
in
germany
easily
drinkable
with
some
good
friends
as
you
sit
around
the
table
and
chat
unfortunately
my
only
negative
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
fairly
flat
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
its
smooth
and
cool
but
hearty
it
doesnt
make
you
feel
loaded
down
at
all
i
could
definitely
stand
another
will
buy
it
again
may
have
people
over
for
an
evening
of
different
brewerys
oktoberfests
around
midoctober
and
this
will
definitely
make
an
appearance
i
cant
imagine
a
much
better
ofest
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
delicate
but
impressive
makes
you
want
more
highly
recommended
12
oz
oktoberfest
bottle
as
shown
on
the
brewery
website
purchased
as
a
single
at
the
vintage
cellar
my
first
festbier
of
the
season
pours
a
clear
and
glowing
copper
amber
body
with
a
khaki
head
that
rises
one
finger
good
retention
before
falling
into
profuse
patchy
and
sticky
lace
munich
malt
aroma
has
notes
of
molasses
maple
syrup
and
toffee
spicy
floral
hops
back
up
the
sweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
has
a
light
medium
body
with
appropriate
medium
carbonation
taste
is
dominated
by
the
same
maltiness
noted
in
the
aroma
munichesque
notes
of
toffee
molasses
caramel
and
a
definite
hint
of
maple
syrup
restrained
but
adequate
presence
of
floral
and
spicy
german
hops
very
tasty
but
heavyhanded
with
the
sweet
munich
malts
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
good
drinkability
as
an
aside
i
believe
this
brew
in
particular
needs
a
new
listing
as
oktoberfest
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
fact
that
stoudts
has
brought
the
brewing
of
this
bier
completely
in
house
not
to
be
confused
with
its
contract
brewed
bastard
of
a
counterpart
stoudts
fest
in
addition
stoudts
will
not
be
offering
the
oktoberfest
all
year
round
as
they
did
with
the
fest
the
oktoberfest
as
it
was
explained
to
me
will
only
be
available
during
the
appropriate
fall
months
cant
wait
for
september
to
have
this
beer
again
overall

this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
oneoff
or
to
share
with
friends
to
tell
them
you
care
a
great
storytelling
around
the
fire
pit
beer
and
a
nice
crisp
refresher
on
a
crisp
night
i
imagine
nights
are
still
hot
here
not
a
whole
lot
wrong
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
it
finishes
a
little
more
pineybitter
than
id
like
its
definitely
captured
the
essence
of
harvest
and
brings
in
that
seasonal
flavor
would
i
buy
it
again
for
a
special
event
im
convinced
there
are
some
smoother
pumpkin
beers
out
there
so
im
still
looking
for
that
one
dont
think
id
personally
grab
a
sixer
unless
i
was
having
company
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
orange
red
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
nice
darker
roasted
malts
typical
for
oktoberfest
beers
a
little
weak
but
nice
tastes
of
caramel
little
molasses
dark
roasted
grain
very
slight
fruit
beer
is
sessionable
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
there
was
a
lot
to
love
and
some
things
that
could
have
been
better
about
this
beer
all
tastebuds
are
different
so
i
suggest
giving
this
one
a
try

this
is
a
very
malt
forward
easy
going
oktoberfest
that
most
anyone
will
like
it
is
exceptionally
clean
sweeter
than
most
beers
and
very
likeable
the
sweeter
taste
might
be
a
little
much
for
some
but
it
makes
a
good
choice
for
those
who
dont
prefer
an
emphasis
of
hops
it
isnt
over
the
top
in
any
way
but
is
still
more
than
pleasing
and
most
party
guests
will
find
it
to
their
liking
judgement
must
have
in
season
if
you
like
a
good
malty
oktoberfest
you
cant
beat
this
one
theres
enough
hop
bitterness
but
malt
definitely
is
doing
the
driving
i
love
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
goldenish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
has
a
mellow
crisp
malty
undertone
with
strong
sweet
flavors
the
body
was
very
watery
overly
sweet
and
harder
to
drink
overall
a
light
and
overly
sweet
oktoberfest
might
make
a
good
my
first
oktoberfest
other
then
that
not
much
to
get
out
of
this
one

full

the
aroma
and
flavor
are
both
nice
enough
but
neither
is
extraordinary
the
flavor
in

has
plenty
of
malt
but
it
competes
with
the
woody
bitterness
and
alcohol
not
bad
at
any

i
just
really

with

burst

effervesces
into

mild
bitterness
in

middle
the
bitterness
is
herbal
in
nature
with
a

of

gives
the
tongue
a

releases
into

leaves
you
with

pick
out
some
caramel
malts
toffee
bread
and
malts
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
it
is
full
of
flavor
with
some
sweetness
in
the
mix
as
well
with
some
spice
nuts
with
a
ever
so
slight
hop
finish
very
tasty
and
smooth
brew
overall
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
it
could
compete
with
some
good
german
oktoberfest
brews
prost
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
german
marzen
style
good
toasty
malt
notes
with
some
nice
backing
hops
nice
clear
dark
amberorange
color
with
a
onefinger
head
left
no
lacing
very
malty
aroma
with
some
herbal
hop
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
bready
malt
and
some
noble
bitter
hops
herb
as
the
germans
would
say
just
what
an
oktoberfest
beer
should
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
again
reminds
me
of
oktoberfestoverall
a
pretty
fine
representation
of
the
style
left
hand
gets
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
copper
that
is
a
bit
orange
in
color
as
well
the
smell
has
a
strong
malty
caramel
smell
and
a
tangy
orange
hop
smell
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
although
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
sweeter
the
tangy
orange
hop
taste
works
well
because
of
the
huge
contrast
between
the
two
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
side
the
finish
is
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
and
one
worth
getting
when
available
o
this
is
a
brilliant
oktoberfest
one
of
the
best
octoberfest
beers
ive
tried
very
tasty
without
a
ton
of
bitterness
smooth
taste
subtle
hop
characteristic
outstanding
oktoberfest
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
left
hand
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
make
sure
you
try
this
one
in
the
fall
a
good
friend
who
usually
stays
away
from
anything
in
the
amber
realm
tried
this
and
declared
that
is
a
damn
good

for
style
although
not
the
hop
level
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
is
bitter

hey
its
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
it
just
spreads
out
way
too
thin
over
the
first
few
drinks
and
then
gets
tiring
a
lot
of
beers
fall
to
this
fate
im
afraid
so
its
not
uncommon
but
it
should
be
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
bobs
47
from
boulevard
dont
skip
it
its
a
decent
beer
worthy
of
your
opinion
o
3
5
its
enjoyable
but
again
really
nothing
to
remember
in
my
opinion
a
c
beer
on
tap
for
pint
night
at
mcnellies
okc
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
foamy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
glass
a
faint
aroma
of
bread
and
malt
thats
good
because
malt
is
what
you
get
theres
a
bit
of
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
end
medium
mouth
with
decent
carbonation
its
not
bad
but
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
the
really
good
oktoberfest
offerings
this
beer
is
very
poor
octoberfest
should
have
some
fall
flavor
but
this
beer
has
none
to
sum
it
up
it
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
slight
biscuit
taste
no
hops
no
pumpkin
no
nothing
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
the
fall
season
bought
a
6
pack
but
will
never
buy
another
sam
adams
octoberfest
destroys
this
boulevard
offering
finishes
clean
and
smooth
begging
for
another
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
beer
as
any
oktoberfest
should
be
one
of
my
favorites
i
like
oktoberfests
and
bobs
47
is
a
pretty
good
one
its
not
quite
as
malty
sweet
as
some
but
its
got
a
wellrounded
flavor
and
good
color
solid
fall
seasonal
offering
pours
a
pretty
glorious
burnt
honeytone
initial
fleeting
off
white
head
and
perfectly
clear
aroma
is
a
little
subdued
earthy
malty
bready
notes
and
slight
yeast
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
base
flavor
is
good
but
id
like
something
else
going
on
more
spice
more
booze
just
some
kind
if
hook
to
give
it
some
character
as
it
stands
it
just
tastes
like
a
watereddown
oktoberfest
this
is
another
one
from
boulevard
for
me
that
is
almost
there
but
is
holding
back
i
worship
boulevards
smokestack
series
and
their
nutcracker
ale
but
i
havent
had
a
sixer
of
their
tamer
stuff
that
doesnt
seem
lacking
in
flavor
many
better
oktoberfests
available
no
disrespect
to
bob
im
a
big
fan
of
oktoberfest
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
brews
you
can
buy
every
time
i
see
this
brew
for
sale
i
get
excited
it
has
a
great
marzen
lager
taste
but
still
with
the
boulevard
beer
taste
you
can
tell
easily
its
a
boulevard
and
an
oktoberfest
in
one
which
is
a
great
combination
i
will
say
compared
to
other
oktoberfests
this
isnt
quite
as
sweet
maybe
from
the
added
yeast
in
each
bottle
but
either
way
this
is
a
great
brew
one
of
my
favs
highly
recommended
wish
they
sold
it
year
round
bobs
47
is
certainly
among
the
best
american
märzens
ive
tasted
to
date
in
fact
im
convinced
that
it
would
stand
up
to
my
favorite
oktoberfests
from
across
the
atlantic
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
bottle
next
year
i
hope
that
chimay
which
has
recently
purchased
boulevard
brewing
doesnt
change
the
recipe
o
very
tasty
beer
well
suited
for
the
autumn
through
winter
seasons
fairly
strong
taste
of
caramel
and
nutty
malts
provide
a
warming
taste
appropriate
for
the
season
as
well
as
a
nice
full
smooth
finish
this
is
pretty
good
it
starts
with
spicy
hops
and
finishes
with
them
the
between
parts
are
a
little
boring
but
its
pretty
good
overall
o
a
very
good
oktoberfest
not
a
beer
i
would
crave
all
the
time
but
itd
sit
very
nice
on
a
cool
october
day
sitting
around
a
camp
fire
easy
enough
to
drink
that
one
could
enjoy
several
othe
flavors
werent
strong
the
balance
wasnt
there
a
boring
oktoberfest
othis
is
an
ok
example
of
the
style
with
a
bit
more
hop
presence
than
i
would
normally
expect
the
hops
are
alright
by
themselves
they
lend
a
somewhat
vegetal
herbal
bitterness
to
the
finish
that
i
didnt
really
care
for
but
some
may
enjoy
but
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
match
well
with
the
flavor
this
thing
needs
more
crispness
and
drinkability
if
they
are
going
to
go
so
light
on
the
malts
on
the
plus
side
this
is
a
goodlooking
marzen
with
a
particularly
nice
head
serving
type
bottle
a
decent
journeyman
effort
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
malt
grains
and
hop
bitterness
play
well
together
and
create
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
experience
nothing
exceptional
but
a
rocksolid
seasonal
beer
offering
this
oktoberfest
offering
from
boulevard
deserves
more
than
the
average
3
5
rating
it
currently
has
in
my
humble
opinion
outside
of
sam
adams
i
havent
run
across
a
better
american
example
of
the
classic
german
marzen
well
done
boulevard
overall
its
a
nice
take
on
an
octoberfest
my
preference
is
something
a
little
more
dry
and
spicy
i
look
forward
to
finishing
the
sixpack
and
would
buy
it
again
cheers
overall
a
solid
enjoyable
märzen
from
boulevard
overall
a
fantastic
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
this
might
be
the
favorite
one
i
got
in
my
sampler
pack
the
12
oz
bottle
says
best
by
120112
above
that
is
1101
d
so
is
it
a
year
old
it
has
that
coarse
carbonation
and
slightly
musty
scent
that
indicates
to
me
a
beer
past
its
prime
so
theyre
not
doing
any
favors
with
the
liberal
best
by
date
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
marzen
it
isnt
my
alltime
favorite
but
i
always
look
forward
to
boulevards
fall
seasonal
o
a
nice
oktoberfest
better
then
a
majority
of
the
american
versions
i
have
tried
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
ive
only
had
boulevards
smokestack
beers
and
havent
been
let
down
until
now
this
is
definitely
one
of
their
low
end
beers
pours
the
color
of
honey
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
soon
recedes
leaving
behind
a
thin
veil
of
foam
and
sporadic
lacing
aroma
is
very
mildsweet
and
vaguely
citric
the
flavor
is
also
mild
with
caramel
malt
and
just
enough
hop
flavor
to
balance
things
out
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamyprobably
the
highlight
here
an
easy
to
drink
brew
but
nothing
remarkable
which
pretty
much
typifies
the
oktoberfest
style
to
me
wish
i
had
more
to
say
because
its
not
bad
just
uninteresting
o
another
great
example
of
the
oktoberfest
style
ive
really
jumped
into
the
fall
seasonal
offerings
this
year
and
im
really
liking
the
majority
of
them
d
not
bad
a
little
bland
but
within
expectations
for
the
style
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
overall
fairly
drinkable
the
finish
hurts
this
one
a
little
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
one
wouldnt
be
a
regular
for
me
the
body
was
bit
fuller
than
typical
for
the
style
nicely
smooth
but
the
finish
was
just
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
was
very
good
having
several
wouldnt
be
an
issue
overall
a
very
take
on
the
style
and
a
nuce
brew
certainly
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
overall
for
me
it
falls
far
shy
of
being
an
ideal
oktobefest
o
a
decent
marzen
overall
though
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
the
style
o
another
nice
drinking
seasonal
from
boulevard
im
glad
they
decided
to
release
their
seasonals
in
12
packs
this
year
overall
a
pretty
solid
marzen
has
more
of
a
spicy
kick
than
most
in
the
style
it
makes
for
an
interesting
twist
enjoyable
drink
overall
overall
this
is
your
old
standard
marzenbier
with
no
twists
to
stay
true
to
the
style
which
is
probably
what
theyre
shooting
for
good
session
brew
in
the
spirit
of
fall
enjoyed
this
brew
on
many
occasions
on
our
trip
down
to
kansas
city
mo
nice
amber
pour
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
nice
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
the
hop
presence
at
the
end
flavor
is
slightly
malty
with
a
nice
hop
finish
not
as
flavorful
as
some
octoberfests
out
there
but
it
can
get
the
job
done
overall
i
would
absolutely
recommend
this
beer
try
it
buy
it
drink
it
good
oktoberfest
beer
i
would
like
to
take
this
to
some
friends
outside
boulevards
distribution
area
and
see
what
they
think
tasty
overall
above
average
marzen
that
really
hits
the
spot
however
the
tingly
mouthfeel
and
slightly
odd
balance
hamper
it
slightly
o
this
beer
is
almost
astringent
it
is
so
dry
in
the
finish
and
although
it
is
well
lagered
the
malt
is
hidden
behind
the
bitterness
and
big
fizz
while
this
may
be
a
betterthanaverage
marzen
its
still
a
nice
beer
opinion
i
was
diging
this
beer
until
i
got
to
the
drinking
part
it
isnt
bad
but
the
balance
is
a
little
off
for
the
style
it
is
ok
for
a
commercial
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
as
it
definitely
is
drinkable
i
just
really
enjoy
hacker
pschorr
ofest
which
is
practically
like
a
milkshake
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
long
way
from
that
but
still
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
and
one
worth
trying
out
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
again
overall
its
an
average
drinkable
beer
not
a
memorable
beer
but
very
drinkable
with
thin
head
that
remains
until
the
end
no
lacing
on
the
glass
metallic
hop
taste
lingers
for
a
while
and
although
not
unpleasant
this
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
and
taste
up
front
that
you
would
expect
from
a
typical
american
octoberfest
beer
drinkability
it
could
be
better
but
it
is
far
from
one
of
those
american
märzens
that
looks
sexy
but
lacks
a
ton
of
complexity
drink
not
too
shabby
not
my
favorite
style
but
boulevard
still
makes
a
good
beer
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
this
year
2012
malty
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
spices
love
it
d
really
easy
to
put
down
and
very
tasty
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
and
wasnt
disappointed
again
its
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
nor
the
most
tasty
but
its
well
made
and
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fullbodied
for
the
style
it
isnt
thick
exactly
but
it
has
some
tooth
to
it
it
also
manages
to
achieve
a
dry
finish
despite
this
beers
totally
sweet
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
marzen
boulevard
rarely
disappoints
and
this
beer
has
been
a
fall
favorite
in
the
midwest
for
a
long
time
this
beer
would
be
so
so
good
paired
with
some
turkish
food
some
nice
dolma
give
this
one
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
clean
and
tasty
to
session
smooth
mouthfeel
through
and
through
but
there
is
some
odd
bitterness
that
pops
up
here
an
there
that
is
a
little
offputting
much
better
than
the
average
american
oktoberfest
attempt
but
still
lacks
a
bit
in
terms
of
malt
complexity
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
this
one
is
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
where
i
might
order
a
second
especially
when
its
cold
out
like
tonight
first
beer
from
these
guys
pours
slightly
darker
than
the
european
oktobers
smells
like
a
malt
bomb
decent
head
taste
is
true
to
the
nose
malt
up
front
malt
in
back
not
over
the
top
but
balanced
and
a
little
bit
addicting
this
is
a
great
6pack
for
the
fall
not
the
best
oktoberfest
on
the
shelf
but
a
damn
fine
version
medium
thick
body
keeps
this
one
in
the
gut
for
a
bit
nice
when
its
chilly
out
overall
impression
a
decent
marzen
by
boulevard
but
not
a
beer
i
would
necessarily
go
back
to
quite
boring
actually
but
represents
the
style
well
this
is
one
of
the
last
oktoberfest
brews
i
will
be
enjoying
this
season
unfortunately
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
mixed
in
a
very
nice
smelling
very
malty
beer
the
flavor
is
also
full
of
malt
i
get
some
toffee
cocoa
and
caramel
the
beer
is
pretty
dry
there
are
no
real
signs
of
hops
in
the
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
americanmade
oktoberfest
overall
its
a
pretty
good
octoberfest
certainly
all
well
and
fine
within
the
marzen
style
very
affordable
too
and
also
featured
in
some
of
their
samplers
feels
medium
in
body
with
good
strong
carbonation
to
keep
the
palate
cleansed
and
dry
makes
me
desire
yet
another
sip
aroma
is
caramel
toast
herbs
appearance
is
amber
orange
very
clear
tan
head
taste
is
medium
sweetness
lightly
bitter
with
excellent
balance
palate
is
medium
body
flat
carbonation
nice
slight
bitter
long
finish
a
nice
beer
i
wish
would
be
available
all
the
time
beer
is
quite
sweet
very
caramelly
and
thicker
than
expected
medium
bodied
smooth
throughout
decent
finish
could
have
used
a
little
less
caramel
a
little
more
munich
with
a
lighter
finish
otherwise
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
it
again
finally
a
new
ofest
on
the
market
digging
in
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
caramel
light
cilantro
grass
light
white
bread
light
toffee
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
the
taste
generally
follows
suit
but
with
a
more
pronounced
pine
character
springing
from
the
aforementioned
cilantro
some
spicy
greens
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
for
effect
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slick
feel
and
a
kinda
dry
feel
overall
a
nice
ofest
with
a
slight
american
take
on
the
style
with
the
strongerthanusual
hop
presence
and
drier
finish
not
bad
at
all
really
well
its
almost
october
and
the
oktober
fest
beers
are
rollin
trying
the
bobs
47
oktoberfest
from
boulevard
and
it
is
good
the
color
is
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
nice
white
head
unfortunately
it
did
not
lace
the
smell
was
mostly
sweet
malt
and
some
hop
the
taste
was
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
malt
hop
and
grain
session
no
question
the
balance
and
smoot
drinkability
earn
decent
marks
for
this
beer
boulevard
strikes
again
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
spice
finish
this
comes
off
as
a
real
good
american
interepretation
of
a
oktoberfest
nice
light
crisp
body
the
hop
profile
and
lighter
body
make
this
an
interesting
hybrid
style
but
very
enjoyable
especially
on
a
good
fall
night
or
football
gameday
knocking
back
a
few
im
not
particularly
impressed
by
this
oktoberfest
as
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
us
versions
theyre
just
lacking
the
robustness
heartiness
and
mix
of
flavors
that
the
better
german
versions
can
offer
this
one
doesnt
excite
me
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
overall
this
was
a
solid
oktoberfest
offering
loved
the
malt
i
thought
it
was
better
than
other
oktoberfest
beers
there
just
wasnt
anything
outstanding
about
it
will
gladly
enjoy
again
though
had
on
tap
and
packaged
in
bottle
the
taste
is
slightly
similar
however
the
bottle
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
amber
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
compact
bubbles
with
litle
to
no
laceing
a
nice
malt
presence
but
not
overwhelming
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
give
an
overall
round
character
to
the
brew
nice
fall
seasonal
excellent
ofest
rich
and
complex
yet
balanced
m
medium
body
crisp
slight
fruit
apple
or
pear
cant
quite
make
it
out
guess
i
dont
have
the
tongue
for
it
yet
overall
a
good
oktoberfest
style
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
o
one
of
my
favorite
boulevard
seasonals
listed
as
a
vienna
lager
here
but
marketed
as
a
marzenoktoberfest
by
the
brewery
either
way
this
is
more
hoppy
than
your
basic
oktoberfest
and
not
as
spiced
as
some
of
them
are
overall
a
good
offering
a
pine
bitter
finish
d
nice
and
drinkable
but
not

memorable
overall
a
good
oktoberfest
lager
it
has
a
nice
to
it
but
it
is
not
very
bold
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
poured
a
very
light

very
thin
with
just
a

a

with

decently
thicker

overall
a

beer
id
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
after
a

it
might
become
a
bit
monotonous
for
me
and
id
want
to
switch
to
something
else
poured
from

into
my
beer
mug
a
nice
rusty
clear
color
with
a
white
head
that
laced
some
and
retained
well
smell
was
a
good
balance
of
maltiness
and
graininess
taste
lead
with
the
graininess
more
feel
had
ample
carbonation
and
a
nie

overall
a
good
oktoberfest
sampling
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
several
at
a
sitting
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
the
style
d
pretty
good
beer
but
dont
see
myself
running
back
for
more
anytime
soon
poured
a
clear
amber
almost
bourbon
like
with
a
nice
off
white
two
finger
head
with
some
light
lacing
aromas
of
carmel
malts
and
booze
on
the
palette
it
was
like
sipping
cheap
whiskey
with
malty
undertones
kinda
nice
fair
enough
carbonation
dont
know
if
you
could
call
this
brew
a
lager
but
it
sure
had
some
marzen
qualities
to
it
two
thumbs
up
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
the
47
has
a
a
great
caramel
flavor
and
a
solid
smell
and
taste
fits
well
in
the
vienna
style
as
advertised
but
doesnt
stand
out
among
other
beers
in
the
genre
thats
no
reason
to
stay
away
though
as
this
is
a
must
try
notes
pretty
good
german
lager
malt
heavy
but
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
to
break
that
up
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
especially
on
a
fall
day
didnt
quite
have
the
kick
or
extra
something
to
make
it
great
but
it
is
very
good
overall
a
solid
brew
that
hits
the
spot
during
ofest
even
though
not
an
ofest
season
recommend
available
here
in
tx
rotation
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
12pk
sampler
so
got
2
of
em
i
think
that
is
the
perfect
amount
and
way
to
get
it
for
me
oo
notes
oktoberfests
are
a
fairly
narrow
style
and
few
of
them
stand
out
i
would
say
boulevards
is
middleofthepack
theres
no
particular
reason
to
seek
it
out
but
no
particular
reason
to
avoid
it
either
this
would
be
a
good
beer
with
hearty
food
with
savory
flavors
ok
there
is
one
word
that
has
yet
to
appear
in
my
review
toasted
where
the
hell
is
the
toastytoasted
flavor
in
this
beer
is
this
supposed
to
be
an
oktoberfest
maybe
not
since
i
see
its
classified
as
a
vienna
lager
that
makes
more
sense
whatever
it
is
its
decent
but
nothing
special
enough
flavor
to
provide
some
satisfaction
however
the
rich
malty
nose
was
enticing
except
for
the
dreaded
metallic
notes
the
metal
didnt
show
up
in
the
flavor
though
this
goes
great
in
the
fall
with
some
grilled
brats
and
a
football
game
d
simple
and
good
boulevardy
overall
a
week
attempt
at
an
oktoberfest
i
feel
like
boulevard
does
a
lot
of
very
good
big
beers
but
their
everyday
six
pack
styles
are
sorely
lacking
this
is
a
prime
example
d
this
is
a
nice
oktoberfest
its
flavorful
without
being
overly
strong
a
solid
pickup
a
crystal
clear
medium
amber
brew
with
good
frothy
head
and
carbonation
light
hoppy
and
malt
aromas
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
satisfying
but
still
quite
drinkable
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
with
a
clean
crisp
slightly
sweet
finish

along
with
the

yeast
is
this
thing
a
lager
guess
i
should
have
actually
read
the
bottle
if
it
is
a
lager
its
surprisingly
dark
as
the
color
borders
on
amber
smell
is
average
at
best
was
hoping
for
more
malt
but
the
aroma
just
isnt
there
medium
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
is
present
in
the
body
of
the
beer
kind
of
sticky
but
not
overly
so
i
find
this
beer
coating
the
roof
of
my
mouth
more
than
others
in
the
style
not
as
watery
as
i
had
anticipated
good
malt
body
in
this
beer
much
moreso
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
theres
a
nice
mix
of
caramel
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
if
youre
a
hop
head
youll
find
the
hops
about
23rds
of
the
way
through
drinking
the
beer
brown
sugar
malt
sweetness
greets
the
palate
introduces
itself
before
moving
out
of
the
way
for
the
hops
the
hops
stay
briefly
and
then
youre
left
with
more
malt
sweetness
and
some
mild
hop
bitterness
its
actually
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
also
very
easy
drinking
stuff
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
department
the
entire
beer
is
rather
subdued
and
while
the
mouthfeel
isnt
watery
the
taste
feels
like
it
could
be
pushed
up
a
couple
of
degrees
without
sacrificing
anything
overall
though
a
decent
brew
and
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
tonight
to
keep
me
company
surprisingly
ive
been
drinking
some
octoberfest
beers
lately
and
i
believe
this
is
the
last
one
in
the
fridge
pours
a
brilliant
amber
color
with
a
smallish
ecru
head
this
is
what
a
glass
of
beer
should
look
like
a
little
spicy
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
on
the
palate
sweet
crisp
and
a
little
bit
bitter
a
nice
fall
refresher
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
dry
finish
provided
by
the
hops
thanks
blueokie
drinkability
highly
drinkable
but
i
think
a
little
lower
than
it
should
be
for
the
abv
a
nicely
crafted
beer
and
easily
sessionable
boulevard
does
a
consistently
good
job
of
creating
well
blended
brews
and
this
one
easily
exceeded
my
expectations
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
sweet
simple
ugh
vienna
lager
id
say
marzen
but
whatever
quaffable
and
smooth
d
great
food
beer
bring
on
the
bratwurst
and
red
cabbage
also
make
a
nice
session
beer
tasty
flavors
but
nothing
that
gets
old
d
just
average
not
a
stand
out
d
easy
drinking
just
enough
malt
and
sweetness
to
satisfy
having
a
couple
decent
abv
will
get
more
for
the
holidays
pours

and
decent

smells
of
sweet

the
style
of
a

mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
sweet

slight

overall
great
flavors
good
blend
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
in
my
opinoin
d
pretty
good
fest
bier
more
sessionable
than
most
though
not
a
big
d
this
is
a
nice
amber
lager
it
fits
the
vienna
style
quite
well
very
drinkable
another
decent
beer
from
boulevard
a
terrific
example
of
the
style
here
again
vienna
lager
or
oktoberfest
doesnt
matter
to
me
its
delicious
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
sessionable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
harsh
finish
this
one
would
actually
be
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
this
is
one
that
boulevard
could
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
significantly
improve
with
some
fine
tuning
nothing
terrible
but
not
something
ill
be
picking
up
next
year
this
brew
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
toasty
and
a
bit
of
huskgrain
the
flavor
is
moderatehigh
malt
toasty
with
a
bit
of
a
drypuckering
quality
especially
at
the
swallow
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
the
swallow
is
rather
dry
combined
with
a
bit
of
a
puckering
quality
from
the
grains
makes
this
a
bit
below
a
top
notch
oktoberfest
d
this
is
a
nice
autumnal
lager
that
is
pretty
easy
to
go
down
a
bit
thin
but
quite
drinkable
this
one
is
a
little
lighter
on
the
toasty
malts
than
most
and
has
a
strong
nutty
presence
not
too
much
sweetness
and
is
fairly
dry
for
the
style
there
is
some
graininess
in
there
as
well
as
some
tannic
bitterness
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
consume
large
quantities
of
but
the
overall
flavor
of
it
is
somewhat
light
not
a
bad
offering
and
can
hang
with
the
german
crowd
fairly
well
this
one
will
be
a
repeat
purchase
around
this
time
of
year
for
me
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
manageable
flavors
are
smooth
not
overwhelming
is
slightly
filling
good
session
beer
in
the
fall
it
may
have
trouble
standing
up
to
its
peers
if
tasted
side
by
side
but
alone
it
is
good
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
the
biggest
issue
being
the
intensity
of
aroma
and
taste
allowing
the
balance
to
be
more
enjoyed
it
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
enjoying
the
taste
does
not
become
overwhelming
nor
does
the
alcohol
d
refreshing
and
good
abv
not
my
favorite
offering
from
boulevard
but
a
solid
beer
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
i
can
see
why
some
people
do
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
it
just
needs
a
little
more
substance
not
alot
just
a
little
the
hops
are
probably
about
right
but
the
malts
are
lacking
i
would
also
agree
with
previous
posters
that
there
is
a
metallic
taste
that
shows
up
sometimes
drinkability
good
and
tasty
for
fall
each
sips
manages
to
pack
in
good
flavor
but
end
quickly
and
cleanly
making
for
a
very
sessionable
bavarian
style
beer
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
care
for
this
in
years
past
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
this
season
and
will
eagerly
look
forward
to
its
arrival
each
fall
sure
its
drinkable
but
its
not
something
id
pay
premium
prices
for
maybe
if
i
could
get
a
sixer
for
less
than
7
it
would
be
a
worth
by
as
it
is
this
is
a
poor
martzenlager
with
some
strange
off
flavors
d
easy
to
drink
not
incredibly
flavorful
but
still
good
overall
impression
very
drinkable
only
negative
is
that
the
aroma
is
a
bit
harsh
otherwise
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
just
okay
overall
pretty
nice
beer
i
would
get
this
again
but
honestly
it
would
be
a
hard
sell
if
sa
octoberfest
was
sitting
next
to
it
overall
a
nice
versatile
beer
that
is
enjoyable
and
shouldnt
offend
too
many
palates
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
standard
shaker
pint
glass
the
lager
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
off
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
light
toasty
bread
very
grassy
slightly
bitter
hops
fall
fruits
sweet
caramel
malts
rather
thin
in
body
but
adequately
carbonated
not
terrible
but
id
probably
pass
on
having
another
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
goes
down
with
absolute
ease
great
taste
and
feel
and
all
around
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
yet
trumping
even
my
last
review
of
baron
brewings
oktoberfes
most
of
what
ive
had
from
boulevard
is
really
good
and
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
it
was
clear
and
bright
in
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
predominantly
malty
and
sweet
its
too
bad
thats
what
the
beer
tasted
like
as
well
it
was
one
sided
and
mostly
malty
sweet
with
some
fruit
and
diyctal
flavors
all
in
all
its
just
too
simple
it
need
to
clean
up
the
diycital
and
possable
get
some
more
hops
personally
i
dont
agree
with
the
oktoberfest
labeling
if
its
not
a
marzen
i
had
this
at
the
end
of
its
drink
by
date
so
maybe
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
metal
drinks
alright
getting
a
semistale
vibe
here
will
rereview
when
i
can
find
fresher
this
sample
is
pretty
run
of
the
mill
for
the
style
notes
from
and
tasted
on
110806
hmmm
i
wish
had
something
better
to
say
about
this
boulevard
offering
i
have
to
admit
that
this
was
probably
thee
most
mediocre
of
the
ofests
that
i
tried
this
season
it
tries
to
come
on
too
strong
and
sometimes
a
bit
artificial
with
what
its
got
and
just
didnt
sit
well
with
me
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
another
hit
by
one
of
my
favorite
midwest
breweries
from
mhewes
in
preseason
football
bif
poured
into
a
generic
chalice
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
reddishcopper
color
though
the
head
retention
is
lacking
the
nose
is
fairly
grainy
with
a
very
light
toastiness
the
taste
mostly
continues
a
similar
grain
sorry
a
better
malt
profile
would
really
help
this
beer
as
it
is
its
pretty
ordinary
i
tasted
some
very
odd
flavors
reminiscient
of
the
flavors
i
dont
care
for
in
german
hefeweizens
flavors
ive
come
to
think
of
as
yeasty
overall
it
tasted
more
to
me
like
i
was
drinking
a
hefeweizen
than
an
oktoberfest
its
a
meh
beer
worth
a
shot
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
i
might
drink
it
again
if
presented
the
opportunity
it
has
a
great
dark
amber
and
somewhat
orange
body
the
cream
colored
head
disappears
quickly
into
a
thin
lace
it
smells
spicy
and
wheat
like
even
though
it
is
not
a
wheat
it
has
a
great
marzen
flavor
it
is
sweet
and
malty
balanced
out
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
cannot
wait
until
next
year
this
beer
has
some
brewing
flaws
that
should
covered
up
its
not
something
ill
be
trying
again
d
extremely
drinkable
just
not
very
memorable
easytodrink
very
smooth
lightly
toasted
malts
no
hoppiness
to
speak
of
sweet
without
being
syrupy
i
usually
find
oktoberfest
beers
too
sweet
but
this
is
nice
good
work
by
boulevard
d
pretty
good
oktoberfest
however
it
did
not
hold
my
interest
as
much
as
i
wanted
it
to
however
it
is
one
of
the
better
boulevard
beers
i
have
tried
this
is
probably
my
favorite
boulevard
excluding
the
smokestack
series
d
nothing
i
would
buy
a
regular
basis
just
doesnt
really
get
me
md
medium
bodied
but
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
is
so
sticky
sweet
it
verges
on
unpleasant
still
a
drinkable
ofest
this
brew
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
an
offwhite
sudsy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
toasted
malt
and
a
light
caramel
sweetness
with
some
spicyherbaceous
hops
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
some
quality
toasted
malts
backed
up
by
a
faint
sweetness
otoh
the
hops
seem
somewhat
heavyhanded
in
this
beer
and
i
like
hops
the
malt
and
hops
are
nicely
balanced
but
in
an
ofest
i
expect
the
malt
to
be
in
the
forefront
even
so
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
one
that
boulevard
could
stand
to
market
more
than
just
the
fall
and
should
they
only
stick
to
the
fall
start
distributing
in
midaugust
at
least
here
in
illinois
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
boulevard
right
up
there
with
bully
porter
and
zon
well
done
and
one
to
which
ill
return
many
more
times
very
good
helles
lager
d
one
of
the
more
flavorful
oktoberfest
style
beers
that
ive
tried
low
alcohol
and
good
flavor
make
for
a
very
sessionable
ale
very
nice
impressive
for
a
beer
with
just
4
5
alcohol
time
to
crack
another
always
look
forward
to
fall
when
47
becomes
available
a
very
sessionable
beer
with
some
great
overall
flavor
and
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
a
brewery
thats
never
been
one
to
take
chancesthough
their
recent
smokestack
series
is
changing
that
quick
md
low
carbonation
a
bit
of
metallic
aftertaste
i
see
the
abv
is
under
5
i
can
really
really
see
myself
making
this
a
session
beer
if
it
becomes
yearround
d
easy
to
drink
good
as
a
sipper
and
a
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
more
of
light
abv
at
around
4
5
makes
for
an
appropriate
session
beer
good
job
overall
boulevard
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
drinkability
a
decent
beer
with
complex
flavors
could
use
a
little
more
structure
and
body
in
my
humble
opinion
drinkability
is
moderate
its
a
fine
beer
just
nothing
exceptional
pretty
good
nothing
i
could
ever
rave
about
but
one
of
the
tastier
offerings
from
this
average
brewery
poured
a
120z
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
copperish
red
with
a
small
12
inch
white
head
that
disappears
into
just
a
slight
rim
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
big
on
roasted
malts
with
a
really
spicy
hop
notes
that
are
not
found
in
many
other
beers
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
there
really
are
not
a
lot
of
nuances
in
bobs
but
it
suits
it
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
carbonated
i
think
this
is
the
best
seasonal
that
boulevard
puts
out
i
seek
it
out
every
year
and
buy
about
a
case
over
the
fall
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
it
is
my
go
to
beer
in
the
septemberoctober
months
very
drinkable
with
a
satisfying
flavor
and
low
abv
i
just
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
in
my
area
medium
carbonation
and
clean
in
the
mouth
crisp
and
very
enjoyable
i
will
be
drinking
this
all
fall
long
and
possibly
into
the
winter
mdvery
smooth
medium
body
extremly
easy
to
drink
makes
me
wish
it
was
around
longer
this
one
as
well
as
the
sam
adams
this
year
i
will
most
likely
buy
a
case
of
to
get
me
through
all
those
times
i
wish
i
could
have
one
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
short
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
tap
glass
d
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
smooth
and
mildly
refreshing
the
flavors
come
together
to
make
a
nice
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
the
try
this
one
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
more
boulevard
beers
in
the
future
the
boulevard
smokestack
brews
really
piqued
my
interest
in
boulevard
beers
again
and
seeing
as
ive
had
a
hankerin
for
a
lager
lately
it
seems
fitting
to
give
this
one
a
shot
pours
a
light
amber
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
a
big
light
tan
head
which
rounds
itself
off
high
above
the
rim
wide
streaks
of
lacing
are
left
after
the
head
settles
down
in
a
slow
fashion
smells
a
bit
sweet
at
first
with
some
malts
grains
hay
and
a
bit
of
hops
making
things
interesting
the
smell
is
not
as
dull
as
some
lagers
tend
to
be
tastes
of
sweet
malts
up
front
a
bit
of
sweet
tea
hops
and
a
faint
hint
of
spices
in
the
background
super
drinkable
and
very
tasty
this
one
proves
a
lager
can
be
tasty
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
sound
like
a
beer
commercial
something
so
many
breweries
forget
which
is
too
bad
for
the
style
one
of
my
new
favorite
lagers
nice
caramel
and
bready
malt
flavour
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
thanks
to
a
small
but
it
is
there
hop
presence
wow
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
wanted
to
drink
extremely
drinkable
for
memouthfeel
was
nice
and
not
a
bit
watery
and
very
satisfying
i
just
wish
i
could
buy
some
sixers
around
town
pours
amber
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
tart
malt
and
lagerlike
yeastiness
in
the
smell
flavor
is
light
somewhat
crisp
body
with
a
mild
bitterness
sourdough
breadiness
and
while
not
my
favorite
a
drinkable
flavorful
beer
with
an
interesting
tartness
thanks
to
markabberant
and
your
positive
review
of
this
brew
made
grabbing
a
six
of
this
an
easy
choice
thanks

d
bobs
47
is
excellent
and
an
exceptional
example
of
the
helles
lager
clean
crisp
and
delicious
for
a
company
known
for
their
american
wheat
this
was
a
great
surprise
that
i
really
enjoyed
somewhat
of
a
pale
coppery
color
with
little
discernable
head
sharp
aroma
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
smellbite
to
it
fairly
malty
flavornice
residual
sweetness
against
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
decent
mouthfeelsomewhat
soft
and
bready
quite
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
the
drinkability
is
good
my
only
complaint
is
that
boulevard
doesnt
sell
this
yearround
tonight
felt
like
a
bobs
47
night
with
a
crisp
bite
in
the
wind
outside
me
warm
inside
watching
my
jayhawks
dance
all
over
texas
am
boulevards
bobs
47
is
a
munich
style
lager
very
oktoberfest
i
poured
a
bottle
of
the
brew
into
a
glass
beer
mug
and
snapped
this
picture
with
my
phone
the
head
pours
bubbly
but
thin
and
quickly
dissipates
leaving
very
light
lacing
the
color
is
an
orangeyamber
like
copper
and
very
clear
in
a
filtered
sort
of
way
sticking
my
nose
into
the
mug
it
smells
sweet
a
little
fruity
and
slightly
spicy
the
first
sip
has
a
sweet
malty
bready
flavor
followed
by
minor
bite
perhaps
hops
the
boulevard
site
says
the
beer
is
brewed
with
a
combination
of
pale
munich
carapils
aromatic
malts
and
magnum
hallertau
hops
it
is
carbonated
well
to
provide
some
lightness
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
this
beer
presents
like
it
will
be
too
sweet
but
the
taste
left
afterwards
is
a
bit
dry
only
slightly
bitter
and
drives
me
to
take
another
sip
and
another
like
most
of
boulevards
seasonal
brews
i
wish
this
one
was
available
for
longer
periods
our
keg
at
work
is
sporting
bobs
right
now
i
have
been
working
overtime
lately
d
sessionable
another
quality
nonwheat
offering
from
boulevard
too
bad
its
seasonal
flavors
of
caramel
malt
some
underlying
bitterness
husky
grain
not
all
that
memorable
but
its
simplicity
works
in
its
favor
well
carbonated
and
probably
sessionable
but
i
had
to
reach
for
something
else
after
one
d
this
one
totally
came
out
of
left
field
and
floored
me
i
was
expecting
a
somewhat
boring
pilsenerlike
lager
and
got
a
hoppy
fruit
bomb
with
deep
toasted
malts
heres
to
bob
werkowitch
is
a
pretty
decent
one
note
i
am
rating
this
beer
based
on
the
vienna
style
instead
of
helles
helles
is
defined
as
a
light
colored
beer
helles
is
german
for
bright
and
this
beer
is
copper
or
amber
in
appearance
which
is
more
in
line
with
a
vienna
style
lager
i
tasted
bobs
47
sidebyside
with
an
ayinger
jahrhundert
and
they
are
two
different
types
of
beer
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
healthy
white
head
this
brew
had
a
modest
nose
of
mostly
sweet
grains
the
malt
body
was
round
and
juicy
with
a
twinge
of
tea
flavor
crisp
and
clean
on
the
palate
the
hops
had
a
surprising
citric
quality
that
was
unexpected
for
the
style
i
never
really
got
any
noble
hop
vibes
out
of
the
beer
i
e
grass
herbs
hay
etc
despite
this
perceived
shortcoming
it
is
really
a
solid
beer
that
goes
down
super
smooth
good
beer
that
ill
gladly
drink
again
well
done
guys
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
hops
with
nice
biscuity
toasty
notes
the
taste
is
of
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
hoppier
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
a
little
too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
nonetheless
i
would
drink
this
again
there
is
probably
a
tad
too
much
hops
in
this
to
be
true
to
style
but
i
like
it
a
great
lager
approachable
to
newbies
but
enough
going
on
to
satisfy
those
looking
for
more
very
impressive
i
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
it
would
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
bottle
5
of
my
six
pack
best
before
120107
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
good
white
colored
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
along
with
fruity
and
spicy
hops
taste
is
very
well
balanced
hops
are
herbally
with
some
toasted
sweet
malt
present
there
is
a
slightly
fruity
background
as
the
beer
warms
hops
also
finish
pretty
spicy
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
a
very
easy
drinker
for
the
fall
especially
comming
in
at
less
than
5
abv
boulevard
does
some
good
stuff
and
this
is
no
exception
body
is
about
right
although
the
thin
flavor
cant
help
but
influence
the
overall
perception
that
the
beer
itself
is
thin
easy
to
drink
and
if
the
sweetness
doesnt
aggravate
you
then
i
could
see
making
a
night
of
this
one
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
score
well
when
adhering
strictly
to
stylistic
guidelines
but
at
the
same
time
is
pretty
darn
good
just
from
an
enjoyability
standpoint
good
brew
pours
a
light
redorange
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
faint
typical
lager
almost
tastes
alelike
i
dont
know
if
they
bottle
condition
the
beer
it
says
so
on
the
label
but
i
didnt
notice
any
sediment
or
haze
or
if
its
the
specific
yeast
strain
they
use
or
what
it
sortof
misses
the
mark
for
a
helles
but
it
still
is
a
very
good
tasting
brew
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
hits
your
tongue
on
first
sip
matched
with
good
carbonation
after
you
taste
the
well
rounded
bitterness
from
the
hops
leaves
a
clean
light
feeling
in
your
mouth
quite
drinkable
could
be
a
good
session
beer
with
the
not
very
high
abv
as
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
i
plan
to
stock
up
on
it
for
the
rest
of
the
year
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smells
pretty
good
has
a
small
hint
of
corn
and
water
but
more
predominately
maltiness
which
is
surprising
for
a
lager
tastes
decent
mild
alcohol
sting
with
a
malty
taste
little
hop
note
atleast
from
what
i
can
tell
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
as
is
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
my
bottle
unfortunately
is
a
little
past
its
prime
according
to
the
best
by
stamp
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
tasty
its
an
amber
color
with
lacing
and
a
sweet
almost
candied
aroma
the
flavor
mixes
light
bocklike
licorice
with
nutty
grains
and
caramel
a
pinch
of
hops
flavor
and
crisp
pleasant
bitterness
round
out
what
is
an
impressive
lager
rich
in
flavor
not
too
sweet
and
good
for
the
summer
drinkability
drinks
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
in
my
opinion
drinking
several
in
a
row
would
be
quite
easy
and
tasty
with
a
relative
low
alcohol
drinkability
oh
ya
at
about
5
abv
this
medium
bodied
brew
goes
well
anytime
with
any
meal
great
job
bob
overall
impression
smooth
flavor
melds
the
four
natural
ingredients
in
a
solid
fashion
so
that
none
stand
out
but
all
are
tasted
total
package
is
refreshing
and
clean
but
with
solid
flavor
easy
drinking
very
nice
beer
recommended
thanks
beerhandy
for
this
eyeopener
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
lager
and
according
to
the
box
the
only
lager
produced
by
boulevard
that
is
too
bad
because
this
is
a
great
beer
imo
ill
be
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
next
year
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
not
bad
well
balanced
and
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
next
time
you
take
a
trip
to
the
midwest
try
to
check
this
one
out
another
good
seasonal
beer
had
a
amber
color
poured
into
a
glass
very
light
colored
head
taste
was
the
best
part
very
smooth
not
bitter
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
i
will
be
looking
to
enjoy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
each
year
it
comes
around
i
am
trying
to
get
more
technical
with
each
review
as
i
add
them
i
will
keep
better
notes
draught
mine
poured
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
going
on
in
there
a
bit
of
a
white
head
with
about
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
decent
enough
but
a
little
light
slightly
grassy
with
a
whiff
of
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
spicy
bitterness
to
it
not
too
bad
d
i
was
expecting
a
helles
when
i
purchased
the
beer
but
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
i
found
when
i
opened
this
bottle
the
flavor
is
much
maltier
but
still
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
a
hop
finish
i
will
buy
this
again
the
next
time
im
in
a
state
that
sells
it
this
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
i
cant
wait
to
delve
into
the
other
boulevard
beers
d
i
like
this
beer
it
looks
and
tastes
more
like
a
dunkel
than
a
helles
but
oh
well
i
wish
blvd
would
make
this
beer
yearround
as
i
dont
think
i
can
wait
until
next
september

for
me
this

as
it
has
in
the
past
smooth
yet
crisp
and
very
drinkable
d
i
enjoyed
this
seasonal
from
boulevard
it
is
yet
another
beer
that
i
wish
was
available
yearround
this
is
simply
delicious
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
once
spent
four
hours
of
my
weekday
afternoon
driving
around
st
louis
looking
for
this
seasonal
offering
quit
holding
out
on
us
and
offer
it
year
round
the
color
a
beautiful

pours
a
quickly
fading
head
with
some

but
the
real
redeeming
quality
is
the
taste
full
and
rich
while
mild
without
a
heavy
or
grainy
mouthfeel
fantastic
pours
a
dark
copper
colored
body
nice
full
and

smells
light
of
malt
and
thats
about
it
none
too
strong
nice
full
malt
flavor
in
the
spicy
and
fairly
dry
good
hops
are
also
not
an
afterthought
provides
a
nice
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
and
crisp
finishes
nicely
a
nice
sessionable
reasonably
priced
lager
a
nice
change
of
pace
even
though
i
love
hop
flavor
more
than
malt
all
in
all
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
go
with
your
bratwurst
overall
yet
another
boulevard
present
thanks
to
minnesotas
finest
ba
i
could
easily
handle
a
6pack
of
these
no
problemo
thanks

hazy
copper
colour
with
a
sparse
off
white
head
lingering
lace
aroma
thick
with
buttery
malts
butterscotch
and
toffee
taste
is
the
tradtional
take
on
ofests
a
lot
of
munich
malts
and
an
underlying
zing
of
bittering
hops
the
combination
aforementioned
gives
a
zest
to
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
making
it
one
of
the
better
balanced
ofests
available
light
in
the
body
crisp
in
mouthfeel
sessionable
and
quenching
too
never
too
sweet
or
too
syrupy
the
above
average
hopping
comes
to
play
to
liven
the
beer
up
and
keep
it
interesting
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
for
the
style
recommended
i
wouldnt
mind
it
if
this
were
on
tap
and
on
special
but
id
probably
stick
to
something
different
if
not
this
is
another
solid
one
from
missouris
second
largest
brewery
this
beer
pours
up
very
average
watery
and
thin
with
a
smallish
white
head
about
one
finger
which
does
lace
and
leave
a
decent
ring
with
the
glass
during
the
session
the
full
amber
color
is
beautiful
the
smell
of
this
lager
is
nice
with
a
grainy
presence
overwhelming
an
organic
hop
base
light
with
malt
this
one
tastes
very
nice
it
is
almost
segmented
first
grain
second
hops
third
malt
fourth
grain
finishes
this
one
very
full
and
not
at
all
offensive
this
one
does
not
feel
like
it
pours
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
cheek
somewhat
watery
but
for
a
light
lager
not
too
bad
overall
a
nice
brew
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
boulevard
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
light
not
too
sharp
on
the
tongue
and
the
bitterness
mixes
quite
well
with
the
other
residual
flavors
gets
better
as
it
warms
highly
drinkable
though
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
it
was
during
last
years
release
when
i
actually
returned
to
the
store
for
more
later
that
night
in
true
wino
fashion
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
copper
with
amber
highlights
and
a
one

offwhite

to
the
folks
at
boulevard
bpb
werkovich
would
have
loved
this
too
tasty
but
too
thick
to
be
truly
refreshing
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
clean
with
some
hints
of
caramel
and
diacetyl
the
flavor
has
some
caramel
malts
and
a
certain
nuttiness
about
it
not
as
clean
as
the
nose
would
suggest
interesting
but
not

this
beer
pours
a
coppery

color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
caramel
but
very
buttery
diacetyl
alert
the
flavor
is
also
rather
butterysweet
im
not
so
sure
what
i
think
of
it
there
is
a
slight
spicey
on
the
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
slight
carbonation
this
is
not
a
favorit
of
mine
i
dont
like
the
way
the
diacetyl
comes
through
so
dominant
it
is
not
supported
by
a
good
hop
like
some
esbs
flavor
favors
malts
but
there
is
a
good
hop
balance
a
smooth
beer
with
medium
body
finishes
with
a
very
enjoyable
slight
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
dark
amber
and
has
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
little
spiciness
of
the
hops
very
nice
for
a
lager
it
is
very
bocklike
in
its
character
i
love
the
malty
backbone
with
the
excellent
hopping
i
am
blown
away
by
how
good
the
beer
is
i
was
expecting

cant

munich
style
lager
from
boulevard
is
a
most
welcome
amalgamation
of
malts
and
hops
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
copper
in
color
with
a
white
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
slightly
grainy
with
a
nutty
toasted
maltiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
of
caramel
malts
upfront
it
then
flows
to
a
somewhat
fruity
taste
it
is
toasty
and
somewhat
spicy
in
the
flavor
as
well
light
in
body
and
smooth
to
drink
i
pretty
decent
brew
copperybrown
in
hue
with
a
slight
tawny
influence
ive
always
loved
the
color
of
this
beer
from
the
bottle
a
bit
of
yeast
haze
enters
the
otherwise
clear
liquid
not
much
animation
is
noticed
streaming
to
the
offwhite
head
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
almost
two
fingers
in
height
before
quickly
fading
to
a
thin
cap
there
wasnt
much
subsequent
lacing
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
the
appearance
aside
from
the
color
it
says
autumn
to
me
i
like
that
the
nose
says
german
in
that
universal
beer
language
clean
but
malty
traces
of
buttered
nuts
caramel
faint
toasty
sugar
at
times
earthy
hops
as
well
husks
very
slight
suggests
of
alcoholicfruit
the
nose
is
simple
but
inviting
ive
smelled
it
year
after
year
and
enjoy
it
every
time
coherent
the
potency
is
moderate
the
palate
is
very
tasty
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
straight
helles
to
me
there
seems
to
be
a
little
ofest
in
the
mix
you
know
what
i
mean
right
whatever
really
it
is
a
great
tasting
german
lager
malty
upfront
in
the
middle
and
at
the
finish
the
malt
offers
some
sweetness
in
the
form
of
toffee
a
little
bit
of
buttery
nuts
bread
crackers
and
a
warming
caramely
fruityalcoholic
finish
hops
are
secondary
and
offer
some
earthy
undertones
lovely
this
beer
has
improved
to
me
ever
year
that
ive
quaffed
it
i
think
the
beer
has
stayed
the
same
but
my
palate
as
matured
and
i
can
now
more
fully
enjoy
the
subtleties
in
beers
like
such
clean
aftertaste
there
is
just
a
trace
of
sweet
malts
pretzels
anyone
medium
in
body
creamy
yet
filling
mouthfeel
in
part
because
of
the
moderately
low
but
natural
carbonation
i
really
like
the
bulk
on
the
tongue
and
the
creamy
smoothness
of
the
swallow
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
ive
neglected
to
sitdown
and
pen
a
proper
review
i
e
ignore
that
ontap
review
i
wrote
for
now
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
it
is
quite
the
drinker
im
thankful
this
beer
is
quite
common
in
omaha
for
a
few
weeks
every
fall
anyway
recommended
not
sure
how
close
to
style
this
is
but
this
is
damn
tasty
in
my
book
bobs
47
is
good
beer
in
fact
its
the
best
munich
helles
lager
that
ive
had
to
date
and
rivals
bully
porter
as
boulevards
best
beer
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
the
brewery
would
do
well
to
make
this
one
available
yearround
drinkability
high
and
easy
going
and
at
5
this
is
a
super
sessionable
brew
to
behold
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
astonishly
good
stuff
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
goodsized
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last

slightly
sour
with
a
whiff
of
hop
aroma
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
moderate
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
ive
had
a
couple
sixpacks
of
this
this
season
and
it
goes
nicely
with
most
meals
ill
be
looking
for
this
each
fall
a
decent
brew
better
than
i
remember
from
last
year
this
is
boulevards
seasonal
fall
offering
i
liked
the
color
of
this
beer
when
i
first
poured
it
quite
a
rusty
redvery
autumnlike
the
head
is
as
short
lived
as
autumn
colors
though
and
dissipates
quickly
the
lacing
is
equally
fleeting
not
much
on
the
nose
some
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
banana
taste
is
also
underwhelming
just
a
basic
light
beer
not
much
taste
or
mouthfeel
i
could
knock
back
a
half
dozen
or
so
of
these
and
not
be
bloated
or
overly
inebriated
so
drinkability
is
a
plus
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
remarkable
or
one
which
i
will
seek
out
regularly
im
not
sure
if
its
my
palate
but
overall
this
hasnt
been
the
must
have
that
the
last
few
years
of
this
seasonal
has
been
otherwise
the
5s
would
be
coming
out
for
this
one
its
still
solid
though
and
ill
enjoy
it
until
the
nutcracker
gets
here
though
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
the
body
is
quite
thin
too
thin
to
really
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
beer
if
it
were
a
bit
less
watery
then
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
oktoberfest

am

this

pleasing
of
the
three
i
was
tasting
the
herbal

apple
notes
and
lack
of
richer

left
me
wanting
quite
a

i
will
be
buying
more
of
this

oktoberfest
beer
enjoyable
oktoberfest
light
and
tasty
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
style
and
in
typical
american
fashion
the
malts
were
just
a
little
more
bolder
than
they
are
traditionally
but
i
expect
that
from
these
american
made
marzens
and
it
fit
in
well
within
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
crisp
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
was
just
what
i
expect
from
a
american
made
marzen
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
the
head
and
lacing
could
have
been
a
little
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
its
just
a
nice
example
of
a
marzen
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
was
looking
for
and
it
came
together
to
make
for
a
enjoyable
marzen
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
but
isnt
a
favorite
of
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
marzen
keep
up
the
solid
work
appearance
is
clear
amber
and
beautiful
looks
like
fine
cognac
very
appealing
and
mesmerizing
the
nose
i
detected
cherry
a
whiff
of
blood
orange
herb
even
a
hint
of
apple
head
is
rich
and
frothy
with
small
concentrated
bubbles
that
only
enhance
its
bewitching
appearance
goes
down
with
the
fruit
blend
mentioned
above
light
crispness
on
the
dry
side
and
a
quiet
amount
of
sweetness
goes
down
like
a
fine
spirit
i
keep
thinking
that
i
should
drink
this
in
a
snifter
than
in
my
tulip
glass
although
a
tulip
glass
can
be
mistaken
for
a
snifter
and
i
do
treat
mine
as
such
ideal
for
roast
beef
steak
or
shellfish
good
for
any
month
of
the
year
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
foamy
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
foam
color
is
a
tannish
kind
of
color
the
beer
itself
is
a
copper
color
that
borders
on
brown
the
beer
smell
is
very
bready
and
very
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
hop
notes
the
hop
notes
are
slightly
bitter
the
beer
taste
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
im
comfortable
with
but
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
taste
even
though
its
supposed
to
be
sweeter
rather
the
hops
add
an
interesting
orange
note
to
it
at
the
end
the
beer
taste
also
has
various
malt
notes
such
as
sweet
and
bready
besides
the
hop
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
bit
light
for
an
oktoberfest
very
carbonated
overall
an
okay
and
interesting
oktoberfest
a
nice
oktoberfest
offering
from
brooklyn
clean
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
head
and
creamy
mouthfeel
eminently
drinkable
poured
a
nice
amber
short
lasting
white
head
completely
dissipates
the
aroma
is
mild
and
nondescript
malt
with
a
slight
astringency
taste
loses
the
latter
but
keeps
the
former
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
on
the
palate
overall
a
straightforward
drinkable
oktoberfest
though
somewhat
light
in
body
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
brooklyn
on
the
whole
that
being
said
i
like
the
oktoberfest
quite
a
bit
the
only
negative
is
the
spice
clove
on
the
finish
other
than
that
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
orangebrown
cloudy
color
with
a
1
finger
head
when
poured
into
a
goblet
glass
there
is
a
fine
mixed
spice
smell
that
translates
nicely
to
the
front
half
of
this
beer
the
one
dominate
spice
on
the
back
half
brought
this
beer
down
slightly
for
me
body
is
solid
best
offering
by
brooklyn
of
those
i
have
had
will
seek
out
other
new
brooklyn
beers
something
that
i
was
avoiding
in
recent
months
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
it
had
no
character
that
made
me
want
to
buy
it
again
the
flavor
profile
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
there
are
much
better
marzen
style
beers
out
there
you
wont
be
missing
much
by
skipping
out
on
this
one
o
a
little
light
on
both
aroma
and
flavor
for
me
cheers
this
is
your
average
oktoberfest
its
not
bad
but
doesnt
standout
against
other
examples
of
the
style
its
a
nice
beer
to
eat
some
meat
and
potatoes
with
or
maybe
some
sausage
best
american
okie
ive
ever
had
odd
that
it
really
is
only
this
beer
as
i
prefer
other
oktoberfest
style
beers
in
glasses
prosit
bmfr
auburn
colored
nice

mildly

slight

finish
mild

smooth

crisp
pretty

overall
not
something
i
want
to
seek
out
but
if
its
there
ill
drink
it
overall
very
good
but
not
the
best
oktoberfest
i
dont
know
why
i
am
drinking
an
oktoberfest
in
march
but
i
had
been
saving
this
beer
for
a
while
and
thought
it
might
hit
the
spot
right
now
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
marzen
style
a
style
i
am
not
usually
too
thrilled
about
and
do
not
rank
very
highly
on
my
list
but
style
biases
aside
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
the
taste
is
better
than
the
mellow
nose
leads
you
to
believe
and
it
does
have
enough
going
for
it
to
earn
a
recommendation
light
brown
colored
beer
with
just
a
faint
bit
of
white
foam
covering
part
of
the
top
good
clarity
aroma
of
caramel
and
dark
malt
greets
my
nose
the
mouth
is
a
bit
sticky
and
chewy
the
flavor
is
of
caramel
dark
malt
and
theres
a
nuttiness
in
the
taste
particularly
in
the
fade
o
its
not
octoberfish
thats
for
sure
very
ordinary
o
overall
its
not
my
favorite
of
beers
but
i
think
thats
just
a
matter
of
personal
preference
its
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
but
if
youre
into
the
style
id
say
give
it
a
go
o
a
really
nice
beer
and
the
first
oktoberfest
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
oktoberfests
next
year
pours
a
beautiful
amber
colour
with
a
respectable
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
albeit
with
limited
resultant
lacing
grainy
aroma
has
more
caramel
than
id
typically
associate
with
traditional
german
versions
of
the
style
but
thats
a
modification
i
personally
enjoy
mild
flavours
are
well
balanced
and
again
not
stereotypical
for
a
marzen
lots
of
bread
and
grains
with
some
light
toffee
notes
nothing
that
leaps
out
as
spectacular

could
and

have
more
than
one
of

the
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
to
reveal
a
light
copper

the

d
this

flavor
without
any

it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
boot
full
of
this
beer
verdict
its
always
good
to
see
oktoberfest
beers
that
stay
closer
to
the
malty
origins
of
the
style
brooklyns
is
a
pleasantenough
example
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
notes
a
nice
american
oktoberfest
it
has
aspects
of
a
traditional
german
one
but
a
little
more
hops
to
bring
some
good
balance
all
while
retaining
that
classic
drinkability
i
didnt
get
a
of
of
smell
from
this
other
than
a
mildly
hoppy
aroma
with
some
sweeter
caramel

also
comes

wafts
from
the
bulb
of
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
caramel
and
toasted

aromas
come
out
after
a
gentle
swirl
the
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
bread
like
finish
followed
by
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
and
grain
on
the
back
this
has
a
bit
of
chewy
malt
to
it
but
has
is
a
very
balanced
beer
the
main
taste
is
that
sweet
malty
caramel
that
is
very
telling
of
oktoberfest
styles
nice
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
more
balanced
oktoberfest
than
the
paulaner
i
had
earlier
this
season
which
was
a
little
too
thick
and
chewy
and
heavy
on
the
caramel
this
oktoberfest
from
brooklyn
offers
a
nice
hint
of
hop
and
clean
grain
to
balance
it
out
d
im
a
big
fan
of
marzens
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
always
drink
my
fair
share
every
october
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
poured
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
perfect
clarity
had
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
tends
to
go
away
pretty
quickly
but
produces
better
than
average
lacing
the
smell
could
be
a
bit
stronger
but
still
smells
good
it
consists
100
of
caramelized
malts
i
tried
smelling
the
malts
but
its
not
really
there
the
taste
steps
it
up
from
the
smell
again
you
can
really
taste
the
sweet
caramelized
roasted
malts
very
tasty
sweeter
than
most
octoberfests
ive
had
but
extremely
tasty
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
aftertaste
and
burps
up
a
bit
hop
but
the
malts
take
up
most
of
the
flavor
i
really
wish
i
could
rate
the
smell
3
75
and
4
25
on
the
taste
so
i
gave
them
an
even
4
a
piece
this
is
between
medium
and
full
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
ive
ever
had
the
perfect
fall
beer
if
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
hop
to
it
than
it
would
be
a
perfect
year
round
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
even
for
an
octoberfest
drinkability
is
good
but
mainly
because
theres
so
little
flavor
that
gets
in
the
way
of
swilling
drinkability
is
excellent
and
lends
itself
to
any
festive
moment
if
you
can
still
find
a
six
pick
it
up
and
carry
oktoberfest
into
thanksgiving
brooklyn
brewing
is
essentially
a
short
form
way
of
saying
american
craft
brewers
are
talented
ingenious
artisans
its
a
case
of
student
outshining
teacher
as
this
lager
like
all
of
this
brewerys
renditions
of
classic
european
styles
successfully
emulates
all
that
is
redeeming
about
the
style
and
is
arguably
better
than
most
originals
youll
find
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
left
a
12
white
head
oddly
enough
there
was
no
lacing
at
all
when
i
drank
this
pretty
good
carbonation
nice
malty
taste
but
nothing
spectacular
nice
color
good
strong
amber
very
clear
this
was
a
good
satisfying
oktoberfeststyle
beer
but
in
my
opinion
sam
adams
oktoberfest
is
still
better
quite
a
bit
cheaper
too
lately
it
seems
ive
been
a
little
underwhelmed
with
brooklyns
attempts
this
disappoints
me
since
i
enjoyed
their
east
india
pale
ale
so
much
drinkability
is
not
bad
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
a
good
session

but
i
do
feel
ive
had
better

spot
on

the
style
a
bit

this
oktoberfest
drinks
very
smoothly
and
easily
definitely
could
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
these
worth
a
buy
for
the
fall
season
gotta
say
im
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
i
expect
an
oktoberfest
to
be
very
drinkable
i
did
not
care
for
another
once
this
was
done
the
style
is
one
of
my
favorites
any
more
i
thought
brooklyn
would
really
tackle
a
good
traditional
ofest
but
the
lemon
flavors
the
for
lack
of
a
better
word
metal
taste
feel
did
not
make
me
jump
for
joy
somehow
i
had
zero
head
on
this
one
literally
no
lace
either
not
sure
what
happened
still
in
date
and
everything
else
seemed
fine
just
no
foam
at
all
nice
brownish
amber
color
for
whatever
thats
worth
faint
aroma
of
malted
grains
thats
delicate
but
pleasant
the
flavor
was
quite
nice
the
hops
and
malt
were
in
harmony
a
bit
of
bubbles
but
otherwise
an
average
mouthfeel
its
ok
and
would
make
a
decent
fall
session
beer
though
i
can
think
of
better
and
there
are
certainly
some
nicer
oktoberfests
out
there
but
its
above
average
an
awesome
rep
of
a
ofest
i
was
very
impressed
exceeded
my
expectations

a

that
is

and
for
me
a
great
representation
of
this
style
i
dont
like
when
an
oktoberfest
has
too
much
spice
like
nutmeg
or
pumpkin
flavor
so
this
was
very
enjoyable
for
me
the
type
of
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
which
makes
it
a
success
from
the
octoberfest
front
d

enjoyable
beer
and
just
slightly
memorable
in
a
world
full
of
oktoberfests

not
a
bad
oktoberfest
not
my
favorite
and
kind
of
bland
inoffensive
but
an
easy
drinker
d
very

i
rate
this
high
for
sure
very
solid
beer
and
the
better
commercial
oktoberfest
compared
to
sa
d
very
drinkable
and
evolves
throughout
the
tastebuds
so
drinking
more
than
one
to
decipher
evolution
is
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
tastes
good
balanced
flavor
profile
good
marzen
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
okay
for
my
personal
taste
this
ofest
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
and
a
good
american
interpretation
well
done
medium

with

the
palette
to
enjoy
for
minutes
after
sipping
very
smooth
and
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
very
good
taste
for
an
oktoberfest
no
alcohol
flavor
to
ruin
the
beer
over
time
the
only
trouble
here
is
i
can
feel
the
beer
starting
to
fade
a
bit
at
the
end
of
my
first
glass
stomach
can
handle
many
of
these
in
the
long
run
the
9
506pack
price
is
good
for
this
quality
and
i
would
buy
this
one
again
bottom
line
better
than
average
but
just
too
close
to
a
sam
adams
which
i
consider
for
better
or
worse
as
the
median
for
a
grocery
available
american
craft
beer
if
i
really
wanted
an
oktoberfest
id
go
for
a
spaten
or
paulaner
any
day
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
it
is
a
tade
bit
lower
in
tatse
to
me
then
some
of
the
other
oktoberfests
i
have
tried
good
brew
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
as
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
either
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
but
i
just
think
i
might
get
bored
of
it
after
having
one
or
two
drinkability
is
decent
i
think
as
long
as
you
have
the
right
food
to
go
along
with
it
this
can
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
during
the
cool
fall
months
thanks
to
its
mellow
character
it
lends
itself
to
proably
a
couple
of
glasses
in
a
session
im
a
noob
but
im
thinking
oktoberfests
may
not
be
one
of
my
preferred
types
of
beers
nothing
bad
here
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
i
normally
do
not
like
brooklyn
brews
for
some
reason
however
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfests
it
may
be
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
this
one
is
nice
and
malty
but
it
also
does
have
some
really
nice
spicing
i
could
session
this
one
drinkabilityoverall
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
well
crafted
american
version
of
a
märzen
personally
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
malt
but
other
than
that
its
all
good
its
very
sessionable
and
has
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
another
enjoyable
beer
from
the
guys
at
brooklyn
i
will
more
than
likely
drink
this
beer
again
prost
d
very
nice
oktoberfest
will
buy
again
next
year
pretty
good
but
not
particularly
special
i
like
the
labelsimple
nice
didnt
poor
so
basing
appearance
on
that
simple
spell
somewhat
spicy
maybe
a
little
malty
hard
to
place
tasted
okay
a
bit
too
bitter
but
good
mouthfeelnothing
great
bites
some
but
gets
better
maybe
a
little
soft
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
i
didnt
have
5
more
waiting
for
me
m
again
a
little
flat
but
not
so
bad
to
stop
me
from
finishing
the
drink
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
d
tis
the
season
for
marzen
and
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
style
i
could
become
very
well
aquainted
with
this
d
this
one
does
drink
well
but
not
outstandingly
i
enjoy
it
but
after
one
im
pretty
much
done
and
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
still
i
happily
return
to
it
a
couple
days
later
this
clear
copperamber
beer
features
little
headit
quickly
faded
away
after
the
pour
the
aroma
is
appropriately
toasty
but
faint
and
barely
detectable
the
taste
is
excellent
however
lightly
toasted
very
bready
malt
flavor
nice
that
they
eschewed
the
heavy
crystal
caramel
flavor
many
american
interpretations
have
bitterness
is
moderate
but
it
dries
out
the
clean
finish
a
bit
the
body
is
a
tad
watery
and
thin
but
otherwise
a
decent
okto
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
i
would
have
pint
after
pint
of
this
beer
at
brooklyns
oktoberfest
party
ba
has
a
clear
big
ale
preference
its
nice
to
see
that
brewers
like
garrett
oliver
are
still
making
delicious
lagers
d
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
oktoberfest
from
brooklyn
definitely
one
of
the
top
american
marzens
ive
sampled
balance
is
great
and
the
beer
has
a
nice
overall
character
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
and
would
recommend
it
over
most
other
fall
seasonals
its
drinkable
with
a
watery
consistency
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
isnt
terribly
interesting
it
would
go
well
with
brat
but
the
mustard
may
get
in
the
way
of
the
beer
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
very
minimal
aroma
of
some
sweet
malt
there
was
a
small
improvement
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
followed
by
some
hops
crisp
in
the
mouth
but
this
beer
didnt
have
much
going
for
it
pretty
drinkable
solid
beer
a
really
nice
oktoberfest
not
too
sweet
with
just
enough
maltiness
and
hops
to
balance
out
nicely
one
of
my
favorite
american
oktoberfests
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
for
its
freshness
and
its
boldness
of
flavor
the
aroma
could
have
been
better
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
highly
sessionable
oktoberfest
pours
a
bright
golden
orange
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
quickly
dissapears
aroma
is
very
malty
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
raisins
however
the
taste
falls
flat
while
there
is
a
hint
of
malt
and
caramel
its
way
to
watery
not
enough
carbonation
or
snap
from
the
malt
its
too
bad
as
it
looks
and
smells
good
but
just
to
bland
on
the
flavor
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
amber
with
offwhite
head
very
nice
lacing
smell
light
bready
malts
tart
slightly
grassy
taste
lightly
toasted
light
on
the
munich
malt
flavors
grassy
and
a
little
salty
mouthfeel
nice
feel
on
this
one
softer
and
livelier
carbonation
than
most
this
looks
like
a
robust
marzen
but
tastes
like
one
of
the
lighter
ofests
drinkability
is
high
for
football
season
but
too
light
for
my
taste
cheers
a
great
amber
lager
that
one
could
get
comfortable
with
on
a
fall
evening
excellent
balance
and
just
an
overall
very
drinkable
seasonal
release
d
a
nice
clean
lager
with
a
good
malt
flavor
though
it
lacks
some
of
the
sweetness
and
aroma
that
could
add
to
its
depth
a
good
festbier
overall
i
could
definitely
take
down
a
few
of
these
drinkability
really
high
nice
flavors
refreshing
carbonation
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
d
a
good
tasting
brew
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
dont
believe
i
will
be
buying
another
of
these
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
for
the
fall
nice
work
brooklyn
brewery
d
pretty
good
very
drinkable
overall
a
typcial
american
oktoberfestnothing
too
exciting
and
in
no
way
a
threat
to
the
german
fest
biers
have
a
couple
if
you
want
a
typical
us
fest
bier
prosit
drinkability
good
very
pleasing
overall
but
not
thrilling
to
me
it
certainly
is
a
drinkable
brew
and
very
refreshing
a
good
football
beer
bright
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
tamed
yet
refreshing
level
of
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finish
pleasant
throughout
my
first
octoberfest
beer
of
2009
the
color
is
a
light
ambercopper
not
a
huge
head
and
it
settles
rather
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
and
little
lacing
smells
of
sweet
toasted
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
faint
hoppy
smell
taste
follows
the
nose
starts
off
a
little
toasty
and
the
sweetness
follows
light
fruit
taste
though
i
cant
really
place
what
fruit
is
there
the
taste
is
well
balanced
though
not
particularly
strong
smooth
mouthfeel
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
malty
stick
in
the
mouth
but
drinks
pretty
easy
overall
its
a
decent
octoberfest
d
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfeat
from
brooklyn
brewery
good
flavor
and
character
i
could
easily
drink
quite
of
few
of
these
brooklyn
oktoberfest
poured
a
very
nice
full
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
showed
good
malt
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
seemed
full
of
minerals
but
only
showed
faint
malt
flavors
the
taste
was
very
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malt
however
it
lacked
a
bit
of
sweetness
for
my
taste
but
was
not
an
unpleasant
flavor
by
any
means
mouthfeel
was
good
very
nice
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
was
nice
overall
this
was
a
decent
ofest
i
enjoyed
it
but
again
it
lacked
sweetness
for
me
i
would
not
turn
one
down
also
i
am
glad
that
the
2009
ofests
are
here
d
drinks
well
but
not
all
too
interesting
if
oktoberfest
is
primarily
about
quantity
rather
than
quality
this
beer
is
spot
on
in
that
it
is
pleasing
enough
in
the
offing
without
distracting
from
moving
on
to
another
round
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
nothing
wrong
w
this
one
just
not
very
memorable
is
all
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
dimpled
mug
appears
a
slightly
hazed
rich
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
tight
foam
nose
and
flavor
is
of
toasted
grains
caramel
malts
fall
fruits
such
as
apples
and
pears
and
bread
very
malt
forward
as
it
should
be
i
had
no
problem
making
it
to
the
bottom
of
my
mug
worth
a
try
the
oktoberfest
style
is
my
favorite
but
i
really
did
like
brooklyns
interpretation
of
the
style
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
liter
of
this
beer
during
oktoberfest
notes
from
and
tasted
on
120907
m
very
thin
and
moving
towards
the
watery
style
i
normally
only
pick
up
the
limited
batches
from
brooklyn
and
expect
this
oktoberfest
is
on
a
macro
style
for
a
larger
audience
not
impressed
at
all
slight
malty
aroma
pours
deep
bronze
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
solid
lacing
down
the
glass
looks
lively
carbonated
taste
is
malty
not
as
much
bready
yeastiness
as
some
of
the
german
counterparts
some
sweet
caramel
there
a
little
bit
too
carbonated
aside
from
that
the
palate
is
adequate
good
marzen
but
there
are
better
out
there
12
oz
bottle
brownish
amber
pour
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
sweet
with
some
bread
and
caramel
nice
light
finish
lacks
the
sharpness
that
most
oktoberfests
display
which
is
a
plus
or
minus
depending
on
your
tastes
really
sweet
for
an
oktoberfest
but
style
aside
a
very
drinkable
beer
brooklyn
oktoberfest
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
the
flavor
is
nice
and
malty
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
biscuit
like
malt
finish
this
is
definitely
a
decent
oktoberfest
worth
a
try
drinkability
very
good
goes
great
with
pizza
md
the
beer
had
a
light
body
to
it
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
was
good
may
have
a
touch
too
much
water
to
it
but
this
was
the
only
part
of
the
beer
that
it
really
fell
down
or
it
could
have
just
been
the
bottle
left
a
dry
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
probably
keep
on
stock
during
the
fall
taste
is
pleasant
earthy
malts
with
a
slight
hop
background
beer
is
full
and
creamy
nice
and
suddy
this
guy
is
flavorful
and
a
solid
beer
ive
grown
to
really
like
the
oktoberfestmarzen
style
and
this
one
hits
the
mark
i
will
seek
this
out
again
next
year
d
maybe
worthwhile
not
great
but
worthwhile
tasted
on
11908
a
very
drinkable
american
oktoberfest
with
a
slightly
bigger
body
and
a
stronger
hop
profile
i
enjoyed
it
overallgood
version
of
the
style
while
i
am
dismayed
that
everyone
has
to
do
an
octoberfest
in
the
same
style
i
cant
complain
about
brooklyns
its
really
well
made
strong
flavored
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
not
overly
carbonated
but
just
enough
if
youre
a
slow
drinker
it
may
taste
a
little
flat
at
the
end
absolutely
drinkable
although
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
i
am
usually
a
dark
beer
drinker
this
is
complex
enough
and
alluring
in
its
flavors
to
be
your
only
choice
for
the
entire
night
d
not
too
bad
seems
too
dry
tonight
but
im
sure
me
taster
is
off
a
tad
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
for
the
fall
season
its
a
little
high
on
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
dark
amber
in
color
this
beer
pours
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
mild
but
malty
and
the
taste
is
malty
but
a
bit
bland
the
label
claims
this
is
brewed
in
the
marzen
style
of
course
thats
what
you
normally
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
but
this
one
is
a
bit
drier
than
most
with
a
bit
wimpier
mouthfeel
and
a
little
less
flavorful
that
i
would
like
to
have
in
a
marzen
still
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
very
good
oktoberfest
one
of
the
better
american
ones
that
ive
had
pretty
good
for
the
style
id
recommend
it
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
red
hues
and
a
one
finger
white
cloudy
head
made
up
of
little
bubbles
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
down
the
glass
malty
caramel
and
chocolate
aromas
combine
with
stone
fruit
lots
of
caramelized
malt
flavor
with
some
chocolate
fruity
yeast
and
light
lemon
hop
flavors
medium
body
medium
carbonaion
this
is
a
very
smooth
mouth
cleansing
beer
upon
finishing
one
you
reach
for
another
drinkability
is
not
as
high
as
i
might
have
hoped
for
in
an
oktoberfest
and
not
as
balanced
as
others
ive
tried
so
far
this
season
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
malt
body
and
complexity
otherwise
not
a
bad
beer
as
others
have
noted
its
very
much
in
style
of
the
german
oktoberfests
note
after
drinking
several
of
these
i
have
revised
my
rating
of
it
quite
drinkable
and
would
definitely
have
again

of

style
nice

comes
out
as
it
warms

well
made

than
most

the

is
really
lacking
for
style
more
on
par
of
the
macroero
style
where
its
a
bit
wispy
and
really
lacking
the
munich
notes
overall
im
a
bit
disappointed
good
taste
some
sweet
malt
up

and
characteristic
oktoberfest
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
rich
for
this
style
some
marzens
are
just
too
watery
drinkability
is
good
this
would
be
an
awesome
beer
for
a
fall
session
simply
average
not
bad
stuff
here
but
nothing
overly
impressive
brooklyns
got
another
nice
beer
here
its
not
among
the
elite
oktoberfests
of
the
season
but
its
a
very
good
choice
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
about
the
nose
it
could
use
a
little
strengthening
but
other
than
that
its
a
solid
beer
thats
certainly
a
nice
release
in
the
fall
lineup
recommended
notes
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
tasty
oktoberfest
d
a
decent
oktoberfest
beer
although
a
tad
thin
it
was
a
solid
offering
which
i
couldwould
have
more
of
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
as
long
as
they
are
around
or
next
year
overall
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
i
have
been
spoiled
by
previously
living
in
wisconsin
where
i
feel
the
ofests
are
the
best
but
this
one
will
do
just
fine
this
was
a
sturdy
ofest
from
brooklyn
with
dependable
flavors
and
an
easy
drinkibility
nothing
really
stood
out
but
you
could
definitley
do
worse
this
season
drinkability
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
not
overly
heavy
like
some
other
marzen
styles
very
much
one
of
the
better
octobers
taste
and
smell
alone
will
have
me
coming
back
for
more
definetley
a
good
experience
with
this
one
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
the
color
is
a
rich
amber
that
still
lets
in
light
the
aroma
is
a
nice
malty
overtones
with
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
is
wonderful
the
roasted
malt
is
huge
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
to
it
very
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
and
it
has
great
drinkability
a
must
have
for
the
fall
d
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
the
taste
itself
is
very
drinkable
but
it
made
me
feel
really
full
this
american
oktoberfest
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
year
for
me
the
smell
i
got
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
and
some
carmel
smells
and
for
the
taste
i
had
pretty
good
carbonation
smooth
feel
with
a
sweet
carmel
finish
mouth
didnt
feel
thin
at
all
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
drinkablitily
of
this
beer
is
exceprtional
i
could
drink
it
all
day
on
a
breezy
ocotober
day
im
ashamed
to
buy
a
brooklyn
beer
being
form
mass
but
hey
its
beer
a
very
nice
deep
amber
color
make
me
wanna
chug
it
very
little
hed
from
my
pour
a
hoppy
smells
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
much
the
same
a
spicey
hoppy
taste
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
light
and
crisp
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
caramelmalty
flavor
would
recommend
if
your
a
hop
head
is
search
of
a
nice
drinking
beer
drinkability
one
of
the
better
oktoberfestbiers
ive
enjoyed
this
season
and
a
really
good
american
interpretation
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
abv
is
eminently
reasonable
its
flavorful
pleasant
looking
yeah
not
bad
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
i
like
this
one
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
is
dark
copper
orange
with
thick
white
foam
the
smell
and
taste
are
grainy
malts
a
touch
of
hops
spice
and
bitterness
mostly
sweet
nothing
exceptional
but
i
guess
thats
the
style
very
drinkable
but
oktoberfests
arent
my
thing
in
general
drinks
ok
for
the
heaviness
carbonation
compensates
but
still
a
bit
weighty
for
the
mild
flavor
profile
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
a
good
american
rendition
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
but
i
dont
think
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
find
other
brewerys
offerings
too
malty
the
flavor
lacks
complexity
of
top
notch
marzen
beers
and
relies
on
a
sweet
malt
soup
sweet
malt
aromas
and
some
sweet
fruit
esters
the
appearance
is
a
dark
colored
amber
body
w
a
quick
dieing
wispy
white
head
that
hades
into
a
tiny
collar
the
flavor
is
very
dark
roasted
malt
bodies
with
some
molasses
like
flavor
no
real
hop
prescence
nice
moderate
effervescence
very
smooth
nice
session
a
nice
drinkable
beer
overall
and
a
rather
decent
representation
of
the
style
onpar
with
brooklyns
consistency
in
putting
forth
good
beer
a
really
nice
beer
solid
all
around
good
d
a
decent
beer
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
i
wasnt
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
i
love
their
monster
ale
and
that
is
by
far
the
best
i
have
had
from
brooklyn
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
brooklyn
brewery
so
far
it
blew
all
of
the
other
octoberfests
ive
tried
tried
at
least
1215
others
out
of
the
water
this
one
actually
had
a
nice
body
to
it
and
wasnt
watery
like
the
rest
of
them
also
it
had
taste
and
a
good
one
at
that
some
nice
spices
and
fall
type
seasonings
i
thought
i
hated
all
octoberfests
and
this
was
the
last
one
i
had
to
try
and
it
did
the
trick
d
a
nice
refreshing
drink
for
a
lazy
midweek
afternoon
of
playoff
baseball
d
good
beer
this
is
definitely
a
top
5
oktoberfest
pours
a
clear
yet
deep
amber
with
a
fast
two
finger
receding
head
very
little
bubbling
and
no
lacing
but
good
color
though
the
aroma
is
a
strong
sweet
toasted
bread
bomb
of
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
herbal
hops

dry
malts

the
taste

just

of

palate
is
has
an
almost
offputing
resiny
palate
for
an
octoberfest
bier
great
session
beer
wth
a
softly
receding
flavor
drinkable
but
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
for
both
left
hand
and
samuel
adams
is
better
this
year
a
nice
oktoberfest
certainly
drinkable
and
above
average
dissapointed
yes
reminds
more
of
an
average
vienna
lager
than
a
märzen
a
disappointment
a
good
drinkable
octoberfest
one
of
the
better
domestic
ones
i
have
sampled
this
year
d
this
one
has
been
my
least
favorite
so
far
the
feel
is
thick
and
fizzy
a
little
bit
and
yet
easy
drinkin
a
nice
bittersweet
spicy
malty
yeasty
brew
really
nice
longneck
dumped
into
a
large
ayinger
glass
a
rough
pour
produced
a
nice
twofingered
offwhite
head
red
orange
color
and
very
clear
aromas
of
burnt
toast
crusty
pretzel
bit
of
musty
sweetness
toffee
and
a
hint
of
raisin
flavor
starts
off
with
a
breadybitter
combo
and
then
moves
into
dark
crust
and
toffee
finishing
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
bite
feel
is
a
bit
bitey
from
the
carbo
medium
in
weight
with
a
creamy
finish
this
goes
down
nice
with
some
german
food
the
dark
toast
malt
flavors
may
get
a
little
overwhelming
after
a
few
unique
as
far
as
oktoberfests
go
could
definately
pick
this
out
of
a
crowd
of
fest
beers
as
brooklyns
nice
during
the
season
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
translucent
copperred
with
good
clarity
half
inch
offwhite

receded
quickly
some
spatters
of
lacing
but
not
legs
mild
nose
some
malt
and
caramel
character
but
sweetness
does
not
come
out
too
much
consistent
with
nose
with
a
bready
toasted
malt
character
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
consistent
level
of
carbonation
throughout
good
drinkability
for
the
style
oftentimes
i
find
some
of
the
sweetness
characteristic
of
the
style
to
be
difficult
to
session
as
their
is
often
a
lingering
aftertaste
however
subdued
flavor
profile
makes
it
quite
drinkable
very
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
oktoberfest
beer
probably
the
best
from
the
us
ive
tasted
thus
far
d
good
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
for
me
thats
more
of
just
the
style
though
these
are
easily
drinkable
beers
and
this
ones
no
exception
in
comparison
the
bluepoint
oktoberfest
was
more
drinkable
however
i
felt
this
was
was
closer
to
the
norm
of
the
style
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
oktoberfest
ive
tried
bottle
artwork
a
significant
variation
on
the
typical
brooklyn
offering
the
trademark
b
is
there
and
easily
recognizable
and
hmmm
but
i
could
be
fully
satisfied
with
a
giant
mug
of
this
before
me
resting
on
a
wooden
table
under
an
outdoor
tent
with
only
my
lederhosen
to
keep

offering
dn
a
nice
marzen
brewed
in
march
guess
i
know
the
roots
of
that
name
now
by
a
top
notch
brewer
oh
and
dont
drink
this
one
right
out
of
the
fridge
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
as
with
all
good
beers
it
really
brings
out
the
deeper
flavors
and
aromas
wish
i
could
summon
up
more
enthusiasm
to
match
some
of
the
other
reviews
but
its
not
in
me
for
this
one
sorry
dark
reddish
brown
color
little
to
no
head
very
sweet
nutty
roasty
toasty
scent
to
this
one
very
inviting
very
oktober
taste
isnt
quite
as
full
as
the
smell
seemed
to
suggest
but
its
good
that
sweet
nutty
taste
is
definately
there
just
not
as
bold
as
i
wouldve
hoped
maybe
a
little
watery
definately
a
drinkable
brew
though
and
tasty
but
i
wish
this
beer
would
just
be
a
little
more
flavorful
cause
it
smelled
oh
so
good
went
down
too
fast
a
terrific
brew
and
one
of
the
better
octoberfestmarzens
out
there
the
aroma
is
faintly
sweet
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
for
a
marzen
which
was
a
nice
surprise
the
hop
flavor
was
in
the
low
to
medium
range
which
gave
it
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
the
first
taste
is
pretty
mild
however
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
havent
had
a
bad
brooklyn
beer
yet
one
of
two
brooklyn
offerings
i
had
this
past
week
at
redbones
pour
was
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
topped
with
a
white
frothy
head
i
am
noticing
some
spice
in
the
aroma
more
of
the
subdued
nutmeg
variety
tastewise
this
is
all
about
the
malt
except
for
some
spice
in
the
finish
again
nutmegy
mouthfeel
is
medium
almost
thin
im
not
sure
if
its
spice
i
am
getting
or
something
intriguing
from
the
hops
this
oktoberfest
offering
from
brooklyn
was
my
favorite
of
the
season
and
i
have
tried
all
that
i
can
get
in
northeast
ct
the
beer
explodes
with
the
foam
cloud
opening
which
always
gets
me
going
because
i
expect
a
great
taste
to
follow
and
their
was
no
dissapointment
to
be
found
but
a
lot
of
thrills
the
malts
and
hop
combined
for
a
creamy
taste
with
some
slight
bitterness
which
made
me
think
this
is
what
a
german
oktoberfest
style
beer
should
taste
like
i
didnt
like
this
beer
last
year
so
my
lovefest
with
it
this
year
should
be
a
hint
to
run
out
and
try
one
before
the
season
is
over
update
2007
offering
not
as
good
need
to
review
this
again
in
the
fall
dark
amber
with
a
little
frothy
head
that
lingers
a
bit
smells
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
notice
of
spice
looks
and
smells
warm
and
inviting
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
was
a
little
off
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
present
forcing
the
beer
into
the
bitter
realm
of
oktoberfest
however
the
spices
were
still
there
enough
to
notice
which
is
good
this
beer
was
good
quality
very
consistent
and
smooth
id
like
to
try
their
other
beers
tasty
oktoberfest
you
could
have
told
me
this
was
an
oktoberfest
from
a
german
brewery
and
i
would
have
no
doubts
as
usual
garrett
oliver
nails
another
great
beer
fun
little
beer
nothing
to
come
back
to
though
for
the
same
season
i
prefer
their
pumpkin
ale
pours
out
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
yet
consistent
head
very
nice
aroma
the
taste
is
great
as
well
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
feels
great
on
the
palate
and
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
brooklyn
brewery
continues
to
impress
me
very
drinkable
version
of
the
style
imo
this
is
just
a
slightly
above
average
marzen
with
nothing
in
terms
of
flavor
that
really
make
it
stand
out
drinkability
again
im
new
to
oktoberfest
brews
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
definitely
see
myself
having
another
sometime
soon
best
fest
of
the
season
so
far
pours
a
very
carbonated
clear
amber
with
a
thin
short
lived
head
minimal
lacing
smells
doughy
and
sweet
malt
with
a
faint
perfume
of
hops
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
given
the
glowing
reviews
of
some
posters
a
good
solid
beer
though
not
one
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
slightly
toasted
malt
in
the
taste
but
also
overpowering
yeasty
taste
not
in
balance
in
my
opinion
dry
short
finish
this
12
oz
bottle
was
obtained
courtesy
of
beeradvocate
spiritdeus
the
brown
bottle
released
a
beer
with
a
reddish
amber
body
and
a
fizz
of
initial
carbonation
but
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
very
mild
and
can
be
at
best
described
as
floral
and
perfumey
the
taste
was
sweet
and
bready
malt
driven
and
toasty
but
the
body
was
a
bit
too
thin
there
was
a
tangy
lemony
aftertaste
that
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
though
smooth
and
drinkable
but
could
benefit
from
a
touch
less
wateriness
a
very
average
oktoberfestbier
this
is
certainly
drinkable
but
it
isnt
somthing
id
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
down
might
be
good
with
a
pretzel
and
some
spaetzle
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
till
i
get
arrested
for
throwing
a
brick
through
a
window
extremely
drinkable
taste
was
also
kind
of
bizzare
smell
is
a
big
part
of
taste
is
proven
here
tastes
like
a
spiced
ale
with
pine
nuts
filtered
through
a
grassy
knoll
has
a
snappy
hoppiness
but
kind
of
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
has
the
body
of
a
summer
beer
just
too
weird
for
me
really
to
give
it
a
thumbsup
will
have
to
go
back
for
a
second
one
to
confirm
taste
is
malt
and
malt
nice
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sugar
and
not
much
hop
taste
probably
a
more
true
oktoberfest
than
what
they
serve
at
oktoberfest
but
then
again
cant
have
matzens
at
the
fest
one
of
the
best
domestic
fests
drank
with
korean
spiced
flanken
ribs
and
chinese
spiced
chicken
wow
what
a
combo
bender
factor
brooklyn
has
not
impressed
me
so
far
this
oktoberfest
has
redeemed
their
brewery
their
merely
average
pale
ale
and
subpar
brown
stick
out
to
me
i
plan
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
only
bought
one
out
of
hesitation
before
the
season
ends
a
highly
drinkable
session
brew
goes
good
with
chemistry
and
calculus
i
grabbed
a
fresh
6
of
this
at
the
package
store
last
night
and
it
pained
me
to
wait
for
it
to
chill
and
try
the
color
is
a
nice
deep
copper
and
poured
a
nice
head
in
the
glass
no
real
lace
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
the
caramel
maltiness
i
expect
from
this
style
just
a
hint
of
the
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
punch
of
malt
not
too
sweet
with
the
hops
balancing
the
caramel
sweetness
i
detected
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
great
medium
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
wonderful
drinkability
many
american
breweries
struggle
with
german
styles
but
oktoberfests
do
not
seem
to
present
the
same
challenge
this
is
a
good
representation
of
this
beer
style
that
i
highly
recommend
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
nice
off
white
head
that
falls
to
a
ring
of
foam
aroma
is
malt
light
toasted
grains
bready
and
chewy
smelling
taste
big
on

smooth
and
creamy
malt
carmel
flavors
mixed
with
light
spice
and
light
hops
taste
is
sweet
rich
and
creamy
a
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
brew
guess
fall
has
arrived
early
after
all
and
boy
is
this
a
good
start
orangeamber
color
with
a
tight
creamy
head
that
leaves
some
lace
crisp
toasted
grain
aroma
with
floral
hops
toasted
flavor
upfront
with
some
sweetness
bread
and
a
touch
of
fruit
and

hops
come
in
to
balance
and
leave
some
bitterness
medium
in
body
smooth
and
creamy
excellent
drinkability
a
top
notch
oktoberfest
in
my
book
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
there
are
strong
hints
of
specialty
malts
here
the
taste
is
much
the
same
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
that
bad
it
is
medium
bodied
and
a
good
drinker
this
beer
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
some
may
consider
it
to
be
a
little
too
bold
and
heavy
on
the
crystal
malts
but
thats
why
i
like
the
brooklyn
ales
they
are
true
professionals
that
dont
let
the
masses
determine
what
good
beer
should
taste
like
typical
orange
amber
märzen
beer
color
some
spice
malt
and
carmel
in
the
nose
a
slightly
bitter
taste
dominated
my
sweet
malt
very
smooth
and
balanced
for
the
style
but
boring
a
good
oktoberfest
but
not
a
great
one
ill
take
the
smuttynose
or
paulaner
over
this
anytime
this
is
one
of
the
better
marzen
style
lagers
i
have
sampled
this
season
seemed
to
be
a
bit
lighter
and
more
drinkable
than
others
that
i
have
tried
overall
an
excellent
sample
this
beer
has
a
good
copper
color
just
as
one
would
expect
form
an
octoberfest
beer
aroma
in
not
as
malty
as
i
would
like
in
this
style
the
flavor
starts
slightly
malty
but
finishes
with
an
unexpected
bitterness
a
good
drinking
beer
but
would
i
like
more
a
malty
sweetness
flavor
i
would
rate
this
above
average
i
liked
the
bottle
came
close
to
just
saying
beer
poured
a
nice
orange
like
color
the
taste
had
that
muted
hops
with
the
right
blend
of
malts
definite
october
beer
i
could
sense
leaves
blowing
in
the
wind
as
i
drank
it
good
beer
deep
amber
color
with
a
very
stable
head
the
smell
is
overwhelmed
with
roasted
malt
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
very
sweet
roasted
flavor
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
a
nice
october
very
drinkable
but
could
use
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
couple
more
hops
deep
amber
color
topped
by
a
tan
long
lasting
head
aroma
of
toasted
malt
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
taosted
malts
some
sweetness
but
much
more
roastiness
ever
so
slight
bitterness
on
the
smooth
finish
lingering
roasted
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
robust
but
smooth
drikability
pretty
good
not
a
bad
offering
but
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
hops
would
be
nice
clear
orange
color
no
head
no
laceing
has
a
malty
in
a
grainy
way
with
lite
fruitiness
smell
malty
taste
a
regular
kind
of
carmel
toasted
malt
i
associate
with
style
a
little
creamy
bitterness
that
faded
quickly
weak
overall
as
far
as
i
see
it
pours
an
orangecopper
hue
with
a
thin
head
lightly
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
makes
up
for
it
with
a
delightfully
sweet
malty
character
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
a
very
good
approximation
of
a
german
marzen
id
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
great
for
a
breezy
fall
afternoon
outdoors
a
great
american
marzen
beer
one
of
the
better
more
german
tasting
offerings
brooklyn
definitely
makes
a
great
product
and
their
lagers
are
amongst
the
best
brewed
in
the
us
note
to
self
must
get
more
beer
from
brooklyn
brewery
cheers
to
garrett
for
another
quality
brooklyn
beer
though
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
of
the
season
this
is
certainly
a
well
aboveaverage
one
and
certainly
one
id
have
more
of
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
reddishorange
color
with
a
small
creamy
lace
clean
malty
aroma
very
sharp
somewhat
astringent
mouthfeel
slightly
malty
but
very
dry
hoppy
this
beer
is
really
lacking
in
taste
theres
really
not
much
to
say
about
it
thats
what
makes
it
so
disappointing
i
was
expecting
something
fairly
malty
and
flavorful
and
this
just
doesnt
cut
the
mustard
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
it
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
into
my
16
oz
brooklyn
brewery
oktoberfest
mug
produces
a
goodsized
foamy
tan
head
which
disappears
quickly
fair
lacing
smell
of
toasted
malts
a
bready
aroma
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
perfectly
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
this
mediumbodied
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
calls
for
another
one
bring
on
the
oompah
band
cheers
to
garrett
oliver
for
another
fine
creation
pours
a
copperish
color
and
has
a
two
inch
head
that
dissipates
to
ring
but
doesnt
leave
a
lace
smells
of
biscuity
malt
almost
of
how
nilla
wafers
smell
with
no
hop
aroma
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
slight
minty
hop
bite
coming
out
in
the
finish
nice
medium
mouthful
tastes
somewhat
like
how
zwieback
in
a
liquid
form
would
be
good
to
the
last
drop
and
could
be
drank
all
day
all
around
a
very
good
beer
a
little
more
acidic
and
tangy
than
the
average
ofest
but
not
so
much
that
the
malt
did
not
shine
through
and
the
overall
effect
was
to
liven
the
beer
up
quite
a
bit
hopping
was
reserved
the
malt
is
the
star
of
the
show
and
it
was
quite
crisp
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
light
and
thin
side
the
only
real
detraction
from
this
wellmade
beer
the
brewers
at
brooklyn
are
masters
of
their
craft
and
their
oktoberfest
proves
yet
again
that
they
can
conquer
any
style
in
the
s
w
a
t
team
that
is
microbrewing
brooklyn
is
the
sniper
this
time
oktoberfest
is
the
prime
target
excellent
appearance
and
the
perfect
sweet
and
malty
taste
ive
come
to
expect
from
märzens
mark
my
words
i
will
never
have
an
octoberly
shopping
list
on
which
this
beer
doesnt
appear
a
sturdy
and
spunky
version
of
a
festmarzen
as
a
great
hop
flavor
strikes
you
though
it
hurts
the
drinkability
a
little
a
good
session
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
festbier
a
bit
too
simple
and
not
as
savory
as
say
paulaners
version
beer
has
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaves
minimal
lacing
it
has
a
subtle
bready
nose
with
some
frutiness
peeking
through
has
a
nice
toasty
malt
taste
with
a
surprisingly
crisp
hoppy
finish
much
more
hops
than
i
expected
at
the
end
taste
seemed
to
improve
as
the
beer
warmed
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
brew
probably
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
i
have
sampled
this
season
another
solid
offering
from
the
gang
at
brooklyn

beer
poured
an

that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
malty
with
notes
of
bread
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
notsosweet
caramel
oak
and
hops
there
was
also
a
bit
of
a
vinous
flavor
as
the
glass
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
crisp
and
dry
overall
the
body
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
finish
was
malty

hoppy
this
was
a
very
good
and
nicely
drinkable
beer

with
a
dark

and
a
very
thin
white
head
with
little
lace
or
froth
very
pleasant
floral
hops
with
plenty
of
maltiness
balancing
it
out
the
taste
was
excellent
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
accompanied
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
from
the
hops
leaving
a
nice
mild
bitter
finish
despite
the
hops
its
still
a
light
beer
with
little
dryness
the
result
is
a
delicious
drinable
oktoberfest
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
i
must
seek
out
more
of
brooklyns
brews
my
favorite
ofest
of
the
year
so
far
hooray
for
fall
this
pours
with
a
quickly
falling
faintly
tan
head
that
settles
over
clear
amber
liquid
with
hints
of
gold
in
it
the
nose
is
breadymalty
with
a
whiff
of
metallic
hoppiness
coming
on
strong
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
for
an
ofest
but
had
nice
flavors
of
semisweet
and
toasty
maltiness
on
the
palate
upon
swallowing
the
finish
showed
a
flash
of
yeasty
fruitiness
hmm
is
this
a
true
lager
yeast
ofest
or
an
ale
yeast
hybrid
and
some
hop
bitterness
when
i
should
of
been
tasting
sweet
malt
decent
but
much
better
examples
abound
at
this
time
of
year
wonderfully
constructed
appears
copper
amber
with
a
lucious
tan
creamy
head
sitting
atop
not
bad
at
all
lacing
is
full
and
even
great
looking
brew
from
garrets
brewhouse
aroma
toasted
malts
with
edges
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
german
hops
thrown
in
their
are
noticeable
great
flavor
crisp
not
overly
sweet
but
still
a
malty
treat
with
the
blend
of
vienna
and
other
specialty
malts
wow
a
great
beer
toasted
nut
in
the
finish
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
dead
on
to
the
style
i
am
loving
this
one
possibly
my
favorite
beer
out
of
brooklyn
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
nice
creamy
texture
i
could
definitely
throwback
a
liter
of
this
as
if
i
were
in
munchen
plan
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
jewel
an
excellent
oktoberfest
my
first
for
2003
and
a
great
start
slick
sweet
and
mediumbodied
nice
dark
appearance
with
decent
head
malty
aroma
with
a
decent
taste
that
stops
about
halfway
on
the
upper
palate
not
as
rounded
as
i
would
have
liked
mouthfeel
was
initially
nice
but
stopped
about
halfway
back
with
a
minimal
aftertaste
drinkability
was
average
i
was
hoping
for
more
as
i
usually
am
a
big
fan
of
brooklyn
offerings
light
beige
foamy
head
topped
with
big

colored

the

is
of
sweet

with
hints
of

flavor
is
also
fruity
with
light

and
a
bits

orange

creamy

fine

excellent

medium

a
small

very
good

the
beer
is
a
light

smells
like
rum
punch
butter
spices
citrus
and
alcohol
also
smells
a
bit
like
a
dr
pepper
every
whiff
smells
different
tastesfeels
buttery
as
well
the
spices
are
there
too
this
is
a
good
brew
very
complex
great
aftertaste
keeps
you
thinking
id
say
this
bottle
has
heldup
well
i
would
like
to
try
it
in
season
though
i
would
wager
it
is
much
better
stegmakk
send
me
this
one
so
thanks
for
the
beer
this
rivals
the
black
chocolate
stout
as
my
favorite
brooklyn
beer
it
pours
with
a
reddish
copper
color
and
thin
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
taste
and
it
finishes
with
very
slight
hoppiness
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
pours
an
orangeauburn
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
froth
fades
down
to
about
14inch
and
then
remains
throughout
leaving
a
thin
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
and
subtle
hops
kind
of
reminds
me
of
whole
grain
bread
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
with
some
bits
of
nuttiness
mixed
in
this
is
a
decent
mediumbodied
beer
which
leave
a
slightly
creamy
texture
on
the
tongue
very
enjoyable
liht
slightly
malty
and
bitter
blend
of
an
oktoberfest
it
has
been
better
in
other
years
and
does
change
slightly
as
the
beer
warms
it
is
flavorful
with
the
caramel
taste
of
an
oktoberfest
and
is
worth
a
try
much
better
on
tap
if
you
can
get
it
another
quality
beer
from
brooklyn
f
first
brooklyn
brew
that
i
triedi
liked
the
nice
coppercaramel
to
itvery
nice
retaining
head
nice
malty
aromawith
caramel
accentsvery
appetizing
very
fresh
tasting
malty
brew
with
some
hop
quality
in
there
as
well
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
brooklyn
beers
i
have
tried
this
one
is
better
than
alot
of
german
styles
drinkability
ok
overall
decent
ill
drink
what
i
have
and
if
i
get
more
i
will
drink
them
but
i
wont
look
for
it
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
with
noticeable
carbonation
tops
off
with
a
nice
thick
and
tight
off
white
head
the
head
does
fade
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
toasted
malt
and
caramel
come
to
mind
but
there
are
hops
present
the
taste
is
right
along
with
the
aroma
a
pleasant
taste
of
malt
starts
across
your
tongue
and
ends
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
finish
the
finish
turns
dry
and
sheds
the
flavor
of
the
hops
that
were
hidden
in
the
aroma
a
very
nice
beer
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
this
well
made
octoberfest
has
a
thin
clean
tan
head
nice
malt
flavor
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
to
long
strong
body
good
color
nice
aroma
the
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavor
with
slight
hops
and
grain
feel
nice
for
this
style
good
body
nice
flavor
this
is
what
i
am
going
to
look
for
next
october
thanks
to
davo
for
the
sample
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfests
for
the
year
along
with
victory
lately
i
have
gone
from
an
ale
drinker
to
a
lager
hound
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
bright
copper
body
topped
by
a
creamy
justoffwhite
head
which
disipates
into
a
lumpy
oilspill
of
a
top
which
lasts
and
lasts
little
lacing
aroma
is
fresh
biscuits
taste
is
caramel
malt
spicy
hops
and
chocolatelike
notes
let
it
warm
a
bit
to
bring
out
the
malt
flavors
not
too
sweet
very
well
balanced
better
than
i
remembered
it
from
last
year
when
it
had
a
product
placement
on
ed
the
best
us
ofest
ive
had
so
far
this
year
if
there
was
a
beer
parade
this
one
could
be
in
the
running
for
grand
marshal
my
favorite
oktoberfest
this
year
pours
a
beautiful
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
great
creamy
tan
head
that
last
as
it
rings
the
glass
all
the
way
down
sweet
and
toasty
malt
dominates
the
aroma
and
makes
the
mouth
water
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
smooth
toasty
malt
that
turns
a
bit
sweeter
as
the
brew
finishes
rather
creamy
there
are
just
enough
earthy
hops
thrown
in
to
keep
the
malt
in
balance
this
is
one
excellently
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
that
makes
for
maximum
drinkability
definitely
my
favorite
oktoberfest
of
the
year
this
would
make
for
some
great
drinking
while
eating
brats
and
bigass
pretzels
i
can
only
imagine
how
excellent
it
would
be
on
draught
more
breweries
should
take
their
oktoberfest
as
seriously
as
brooklyn
brewed
in
the
spring
lagered
all
summer
released
in
the
fall
and
it
shows
nice
grainy
toasted
maltiness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
crisp
and
clean
yet
with
a
long
creamy
finish
a
nice
beer
wow
now
this
is
a
really
good
ofest
pours
a
reddishorange
color
with
a
decent
creamy
lace
on
the
nose
the
aroma
of
toasted
malts
cookie
dough
and
caramel
on
the
palate
theres
a
good
sweetness
toasted
malts
cookie
dough
caramel
grainy
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
there
to
balance
this
brew
out
this
is
a
great
oktober
fest
brew
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
brewgrass
festival
in
asheville
nc
there
were
several
octoberfests
at
the
festival
so
i
got
to
try
this
in
context
with
several
other
takes
on
the
style
and
it
wasnt
one
of
the
better
ones
the
hops
in
this
beer
overpowered
whats
suppsoed
to
be
a
fairly
malty
style
big
dissapointment
out
of
all
the
okees
ive
ventured
into
this
year
this
would
be
the
first
one
id
consider
seeking
out
next
year
very
mediocre
on
tap
not
malty
enough
thin
and
rough
on
the
palate
could
have
been
the
lines
at
sunset
2002
octoberfest
beer
and
fresh
it
is
lovely
caramel
color
creamy
layer
of
steady
foam
smells
like
a
fresh
loaf
of
multigrain
bread
with
a
mere
suggestion
of
sweetness
the
taste
delivers
these
elements
as
well
as
some
satisfying
toasted
grain
and
caramel
flavors
some
nutty
hints
are
also
detected
hops
are
assertive
enough
to
poke
through
but
subdued
enough
to
allow
the
malt
to
do
its
thing
one
of
the
best
o
fests
ive
tasted
314
notes
hmmm
tastes
like
an
import
care
and
dedication
for
this
brew
to
be
created
several
months
of
aging
make
for
a
well
palated
brew
see
it
buy
it
and
enjoy
this
excellent
version
of
the
style
this
was
my
favorite
oktoberfest
in
the
northeast
this
year
the
head
leaves
room
for
improvement
but
the
full
mouthfeel
and
exceptionally
fresh
flavors
of
toffee
and
lightly
toasted
malt
is
unmatched
hops
are
mildly
leafy
and
give
a
nice
bitterness
throughout
as
well
as
cleaning
up
the
finish
with
a
tiny
zing
delicious
beer
especially
on
tap
this
2001
beer
is
great
malty

with

with

a

it

beers

this
one
is
definatly
a

for

its
poured
a

it
smelled
bready
with

it

of

with

it

that
is

a

a
lot
of
these
reviews
miss
the
fact
that
german
octoberfest
beers
are
different
from
american
versions
this
beer
is
excellent
to
world
class
not
merely
ok
this
is
just
an
awesome

beer

it

these

we
drank
years

i
have
had
poor
opinion
of
these
recently
but
they
truly
are
the
originals
i
miss
being
able
to
guzzle
a
hugely
tasteful
hearty
brew
like
this
gulping
this
down
i
had
a
flashback
to
my
spaten
days
at

in

anyone
remember

it
provided

much
more

you
would
expect
an

to
be
this
one
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
just
a
little
above
weihenstephans
overall
this
is
a
good
crisp
tasting
lager
however
it
tastes
more
like
a
pilsner
than
an
oktoberfest
brew
that
being
said
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
just
ok
not
what
comes
to
mind
with
an
oktoberfest
kind
of
beer
but
a
super
drinkable
stronger
lager
green
bottle
makes
it
seem
a
little
bush
league
though
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
light
film
of
white
bubbles
on
top
and
a
pleasing
enough
aroma
notably
floral
hops
with
an
unexpected
whiff
of
tropical
fruit
lychee
grapes
corn
flake
and
rather
bready
malts
unfortunately
the
taste
was
more
pedestrian
subdued
and
dare
i
say
macro
an
understated
graininess
maybe
a
very
light
pear
fruitiness
crisp
and
dry
with
aggressive
carbonation
thin
body
and
vaguely
grassy
noble
finish
i
agree
that
it
is
not
really
anyones
place
to
claim
that
this
beer
somehow
fails
to
capture
style
guidelines
there
are
lighter
oktoberfests
however
to
my
palate
this
compares
unfavorably
with
other
german
examples
such
as
ayinger
id
prefer
the
flavors
to
pop
more
after
the
tease
on
the
nose
2
845
even
without
taking
the
skunk
into
consideration
id
still
prefer
a
good
marzen
over
this
one
overall
an
okay
beer
but
there
are
clearly
some
off
flavors
in
this
beer
that
detract
from
the
enjoyment
ive
had
this
multiple
time
in
the
past
and
this
was
much
better
on
draft
so
maybe
the
green
bottles
screwed
with
but
even
then
i
never
really
have
that
problem
with
spaten
beers
for
what
this
is
right
now
its
a
okay
oktoberfest
that
id
give
another
chance
but
if
the
off
flavors
persist
then
theres
better
alternatives
out
there
70100
not
what
i
hoped
it
to
be
but
ya
never

you
give
it

taste

very

lightly
sweet
finish
as
well
overall
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
tried
recently
but
was
decent
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
for
a
bit
aromas
of
spicy
floral
hops
rich
bready
crackery

with
just
a
hint
of

the
flavor

a

sweetness
light
spicy
hop
provides
balance
and
a
touch
of
pruney
cooked
sugars
adds
some
complexity
medium

and
moderate
carbonation
id
drink
these
all
day
long
given
half
the
chance
clean
well
made
with
some
subtle
flavors
i
like
overall
a
solid
well
made
strong
beer
if
i
can
find
this
brew
in
a
can
or
brown
bottle
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
better
the
skunky
smell
and
taste
is
the
killer
of
this
brew
maybe
it
was
the
extra
alcohol
which
wasnt
very
noticable
it
was
very
drinkable
but
too
much
carbonation
in
spite
of
a
very
agressive
pouring
with
a
huge
head
i
do
like
the
hoppiness

will
try

some

some

more

like
than

in
flavor
profile
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and

while
a

and

there
are
way
to
many
better
examples
of
this
style
to
recommend
this
one
101613
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
this
obviously
travels
very
well
smooth
perfectly
balanced
not
sure
about
a
maß
bier
but
this
sure
would
serve
well
as
a
full
session
companion
not
my
favorite
german
oktoberfest
but
a
good
beer
all
the
same
hofbraus
version
comes
in
clear
and
gold
with
a
thinner
white
head
the
head
lingers
on
aided
by
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
mild
but
just
hints
of
malt
sweetness
and
grass
the
taste
is
a
little
more
robust
with
more
depth
to
the
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
and
a
nice
hit
from
the
hops
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
and
with
some
carbonation
funny
my
bottle
was
green
not
brown
as
in
the
picture
it
was
ok
it
was
a
bit
skunky
and
very
pale
in
color
o
no
flaws
and
pleasant
flavors
overall
fits
the
style
well
just
not
that
complex
another
great
marzen
just
a
general
comment
and
observation
on
some
of
the
reviews
of
the
german
oktoberfest
on
here
to
say
spatenfranziskaner
paulaner
warsteiner
hofbrau
etc
are
not
good
representations
of
the
style
is
an
erroneous
and
quite
snobbish
ignorant
american
view
although
all
large
breweries
those
companies
are
oktoberfest
and
are
all
thats
served
in
the
munich
beer
tents
far
far
before
american
microbreweries
craft
brewers
and
snobbish
beer
geeks
these
styles
epitomized
what
not
only
an
oktoberfest
brew
is
but
their
main
line
epitomized
what
german
beer
is
before
papa
joes
ipa
shack
was
sold
all
over
the
place
going
to
a
german
restaurant
and
having
a
spaten
on
draft
was
beyond
a
treat
now
that
were
all
so
spoiled
and
5000
beers
in
a
store
still
isnt
enough
weve
cast
off
some
of
these
larger
european
breweries
to
the
curb
and
put
them
in
the
same
class
as
a
miller
these
companies
are
the
style
some
backyard
hipsters
operating
in
a
1000
sqft
facility
craft
brewing
are
not
the
experts
and
leading
what
an
oktoberfest
is
in
fact
no
american
brewery
is
theres
a
huge
difference
between
the
german
style
and
the
american
version
i
look
for
authentic
beers
and
when
it
comes
to
oktoberfest
the
only
beers
to
drink
are
from
munich
the
american
versions
are
drainpour
sometimes
its
just
about
the
drinkability
and
being
able
to
pound
liter
after
liter
and
have
fun
not
jack
up
the
abv
to
heightened
levels
sell
it
for
a
premium
and
make
every
bottle
some
ride
on
the
wild
side
tis
the
gemütlichkeit
ein
prosit
o
almost
feel
that
i
got
a
mislabeled
bottle
but
reading
other
reviews
it
appears
that
this
is
just
an
extremely
poor
example
of
the
style
completely
off
in
color
malt
complexity
nothing
wrong
if
it
were
categorized
as
a
pale
lager
but
this
is
just
not
an

aroma
is
malty
with
some
honey
sweet
bread
caramel
and
floral
hop
notes
the
taste
is
floral
hops
followed
by
the
malts
caramel
and
honey
towards
the
end
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
medium
bodied
overall
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
not
horrible
no
but
a
lackluster
example
of
the
style
another
one
of
those
german
standards
where
differentiation
seems
like
a
hard
row
to
hew
its
difficult
to
not
just
proclaim
yup
tastes
very
much
like
a
real
bavarian
marzen
and
leave
it
at
that
but
no
we
have
to
go
and
talk
about
the
headier
than
normal
orchard
fruit
notes
the
barely
contained
booze
which
is
technically
a
fair
bit
higher
than
average
no
and
the
general
zeitgeist
of
an
offering
that
slowly
but
surely
grew
on
me
by
the
end
of
the
import
hence
the
time
lag
bottle
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
in
true
octoberfest
fashion
this
is
pretty
crushable
and
something
you
could
drink
effortlessly
if
you
dont
focus
too
much
on
what
is
going
on
with
it
nice
to
say
i
had
it
but
i
doubt
i
would
opt
to
try
this
again
if
presented
with
other
options
heres
my
last
oktoberfest
offering
perhaps
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
its
sad
how
a
lot
of
these
beers
gather
dust
yet
its
even
sadder
that
whatever
a
lot
of
these
breweries
are
making
in
germany
for
oktoberfest
are
no
different
from
their
standard
offerings
this
is
an
example
of
that
but
it
still
ends
up
being
enjoyable
due
to
the
strict
brewing
regulation
that
goes
on
during
the
summer
months
in
germany
these
older
beers
have
been
lagering
sur
lie
for
a
longer
period
of
time
and
the
booze
is
expected
also
due
to
the
inordinate
amount
of
people
that
attend
the
festival
they
have
to
get
them
off
of
the
seats
somehow
while
ive
had
better
oktoberfest
seasonal
offerings
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
if
you
like
miller
lite
this
beer
is
for
you
scary
how
similar
this
is
to
ml
for
me
anyways
sweet
fairly
one
dimensional
and
watery
light
amberyellow
seems
like
a
pils
smells
pilsy
clear
as
yellow
glass
i
would
not
drink
again
sweet
breadlike
finish
i
assume
based
on
the
german
nature
of
this
beer
there
are
no
adjucts
but
it
tastes
corny
to
me
i
am
not
sure
why
the
others
in
my
group
loved
it
so
oktoberfestbier
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
sweet
apple
juice
like
aroma
the
taste
is
rather
pale
light
and
has
a
strong
apple
juice
like
flavor
flavor
is
present
but
rather
light
and
watery
and
a
little
too
much
of
the
sweet
side
overall
its
a
sweet
light
fruity
marzen
o
bland
and
a
bit
off
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
imo
the
big
can
it
came
in
looks
neat
o
ok
marzen
malty
with
good
flavor
great
beer
wish
i
was
in
germany
but
alas
i
have
to
settle
for
my
imagination
hofbräu
oktoberfestbier
has
a
medium
white
head
and
a
clear
bubbly
golden
appearance
with
some
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
of
rich
full
and
pungent
barley
malt
and
sweetness
and
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
hearty
and
bold
malt
with
a
fairly
moderate
hop
bite
to
balance
out
the
malt
liquorlike
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
slick
and
hofbräu
oktoberfestbier
finishes
wet
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
this
beer
so
much
reminds
me
of
major
label
american
malt
liquors
but
without
the
corn
adjunct
or
the
background
cloying
sweetness
overall
i
think
its
a
very
enjoyable
one
rjt
amazing
to
think
this
is
the
first
real
ok
fest
beer
from
germany
to
come
into
bc
a
lighter
version
of
the
style
but
still
over
6
this
is
a
easy
drinking
clean
marzen
that
a
pleasant
bready
finish
while
not
as
malty
as
i
like
for
the
style
this
is
typical
of
the
ok
fest
beers
being
served
these
days
in
munich
lighter
in
colour
and
taste
i
will
buy
more
of
this
but
other
german
pils
at
around
2
a
tall
can
present
a
better
value
overall
it
was
an
average
octoberfest
beer
but
not
quite
the
marzen
profile
i
was
looking
for
i
felt
it
leaned
more
towards
a
full
bodied
malty
pils
ill
finish
the
six
pack
cheers
while
not
one
of
the
top
oktoberfest
beers
hofbraus
is
simple
tasty
and
something
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
a
one
liter
stein
of
o
not
cloying
or
sickly
better
this
year
than
in
previous
years
o
better
than
i
remember
good
enough
prost
its
hard
to
write
a
review
for
this
beer
as
it
resembles
the
hoffbrau
original
too
much
do
i
write
one
that
compares
it
to
other
oktoberfest
s
or
do
i
rate
it
according
to
its
own
merit
all
ill
do
is
so
simply
say
that
i
liked
the
original
a
lot
and
could
session
it
to
death
this
oktoberfest
may
not
compare
to
some
others
but
i
could
session
this
one
all
september
long
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
the
oktoberfest
poured
a
lighter
golden
color
than
most
german
versions
the
aroma
is
all
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
earthy
grassiness
the
taste
follows
with
a
strong
malt
profile
that
has
caramel
and
honey
with
a
slight
hoppiness
in
the
middle
that
keeps
it
from
being
overly
sweet
this
was
my
first
oktoberfest
of
the
season
and
i
was
thoroughly
enjoying
it
what
i
like
about
this
oktoberfest
is
that
for
a
relatively
high
abv
its
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
it
pours
an
unimpressive
bubbly
straw
color
with
a
slight
foamy
head
the
smell
is
grainy
slightly
fruity
a
subtle
aroma
of
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
its
not
overwhelming
the
taste
is
grainymalty
a
slight
kick
to
it
but
again
just
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
all
in
all
a
very
good
session
beer
for
the
late
summerearly
fall
months
seems
like
it
has
taken
on
a
touch
of
skunk
its
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
with
better
options
in
the
style
like
paulaner
and
weihenstephaner
atmosphere
is
okay
fair
head
and
some
slight
lacing
and
a
golden
hue
not
really
characteristic
nose
is
very
yeasty
not
really
characteristic
of
the
style
either
yeasty
with
some
citrus
and
spice
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
overall
there
isnt
much
for
me
to
like
here
even
though
hofbrauhaus
beers
are
usual
reliably
exceptional
itd
make
for
a
good
session
beer
but
its
not
extraordinary
and
is
easily
forgettable
o
it
was
better
than
expected
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
have
had
this
style
of
beer
i
think
i
would
rather
have
great
lakes
but
this
is
not
bad
o
nothing
to
write
home
about
quite
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
beer
was
very
excited
when
i
picked
this
one
up
but
dont
think
ill
be
having
any
more
of
these
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
while
not
artificial
i
find
is
a
bit
overdone
low
c
weak
o
an
average
mass
produced
lager
didnt
cost
me
anything
so
thats
a
plus
but
the
skunk
flavoraroma
is
just
way
to
pervasive
to
be
a
pleasurable
beverage

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
oktoberfest
skunked
flavors
and
aromas
with
flavor
astringency
on
the
finish
make
this
much
less
enjoyable
quite
easy
to

bubbles
are
readily
visible
as
they
make
their
continuous
migration
toward

the
aroma
has
an
appreciable
skunkiness
that
masks
earthy
hops
and
trace
amounts
of
malt
sweetness
the
exceedingly
thin
and
light
appearance
would
lead
one
to
believe
the
flavor
would
match
but
that
is
not
the
case
at
all
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
robust
with
some
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
distinctive
nuttiness
that
i
would
never
have
suspected
just
enough
hops
are
present
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
is
spoton
lending
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
complements
the
flavor
profile
well
i
think
im
detecting
trace
amounts
of
apple
peel
near
the
back
end
as
well
the
sticky
malt
residue
lingers
on
the
lips
denoting
a
body
belied
by
the
thin
visage
as
far
as
criticisms
are
concerned
the
hops
overstay
their
welcome
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
the
sweetness
comes
off
a
tad
artificial
but
theres
no
denying
this
is
highly
sessionable
brew
with
more
robustness
than
id
expect
to
find
in
an
oktoberfest
one
of
the
more
intriguing
festbiers
ive
tried
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
good
caramelization

the
skunky
aroma
also
detracts
from
the
experience

a
somewhat
acceptable
b
hofbräu
oktoberfestbier
is
tasty
stuff
though
its
certainly
not
interesting
or
unique
stuff
its
still
a
refreshing
reliable
brew
in
its
own
right
unfortunately
its
one
that
this
euro
lager
fan
merely
likes
rather
than
loves
one
thing
i
will
say
is
that
this
is
a
perfect
pairing
for
the
first
week
of
genuinely
cold
weather
weve
had
all
year
here
its
light
enough
to
be
sessionworthy
but
hot
enough
to
warm
you
a
little
as
the
night
goes
on
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
to
but
not
a
particularly
memorable
marzen
by
any
metric
o
a
good
beer
i
think
it
could
be
much
better
if
it
was
not
as
sweet
this
is
a
very
good
example
for
the
style
as
it
one
of
the
originals
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bright
orange
soapy
head
lacing
on
the
side
slight
aroma
of
honey
grain
malts
flavor
is
malty
with
a
honey
grain
flavor
like
honey
wheat
bread
overall
goes
down
easy
and
a
sixer
would
have
been
a
better
choice
than
the
single
i
picked
up
o
a
pretty
disappointing
marzen
overall
light
on
aroma
and
flavor
needs
some
bolder
toasted
malt
and
nuttiness
added
to
really
give
it
that
oktoberfest
charm
there
are
better
beers
of
the
style
out
there
that
make
this
one
not
even
worth
trying
oreally
surprised
that
even
on
tap
this
one
has
some
hints
of
skunk
one
of
my
least
favorite
marzens
overall
an
average
representation
of
the
style
the
nose
kind
of
spoils
it
for
me
i
expected
more
the
beer
smells
skunky
and
reminiscent
of
heineken
which
isnt
a
very
promising
thing
for
a
beer
to
smell
like
notes
of
light
caramel
mix
with
a
large
bouquet
of
hay
and
grass
with
light
biscuit
touches
on
the
edges
of
the
smell
the
beer
tastes
light
and
highly
drinkable
heavy
notes
of
creamy
caramel
mingle
with
notes
of
hay
and
earthy
hops
the
sip
begins
as
light
sweet
caramel
bordering
on
sweet
apples
but
then
opens
into
heavy
haylike
flavoring
that
reminds
me
of
a
traditional
saison
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
an
oktoberfest
from
there
it
slides
into
more
spicy
and
earthy
hop
notes
and
then
lingers
in
the
mouth
as
a
mix
of
pilsnerlike
hops
and
hay
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
drinkable
which
is
wonderful
for
the
style
carbonation
is
light
and
the
beer
practically
slides
off
the
tongue
lightly
and
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
dry
with
some
saliva
on
the
edges
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
almostsession
ale
but
it
does
not
taste
like
a
oktoberfest
by
my
measure
the
heavy
hayfunk
notes
make
me
think
that
this
beer
might
have
an
infection
or
something
but
i
actually
like
them
and
found
them
refreshingly
palatable
an
enjoyable
chugger
but
nothing
like
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
definitely
not
my
favorite
of
the
german
oktoberfests
it
pours
a
very
light
and
very
clear
pee
yellow
color
with
a
half
inch
of
rapidly
fading
white
head
it
smells
like
pale
german
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
that
classic
oktober
sweetness
the
flavor
is
pretty
bland
in
this
one
not
the
robust
malty
offereings
i
am
used
to
this
time
of
year
it
almost
tastes
old
in
that
way
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
off
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
enough
a
little
too
light
for
the
style
i
think
though
in
terms
of
body
the
carbonation
is
good
though
and
its
easy
to
put
down
even
though
this
is
authentic
and
all
i
will
not
be
coming
back
to
it
this
year
it
does
smell
slightly
of
skunkiness
but
mostly
has
a
mediumlevel
soft
bread
dough
and
floral
hopping
aroma
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
has
a
garnish
twist
of
apple
esters
at
the
back
end
with
some
light
amount
of
boozy
heat
its
not
a
bold
or
amazing
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
suffers
badly
from
style
mismatch
to
the
expected
marzen
standard
where
are
the
toasted
nutty
qualities
and
the
green
glass
bottle
certainly
doesnt
help
in
terms
of
skunkiness
i
cant
really
recommend
this
one
sadly
it
might
have
been
better
than
average
when
it
began
its
journey
across
the
atlantic
but
it
certainly
didnt
stay
that
way
orange
body
white
head
with
moderate
retention
and
some
webbed
lacing
nose
has
various
cereals
toasty
grains
light
veggie
and
some
drying
malt
and
mineral
character
taste
has
sweet
malts
light
caramel
more
toasty
cereals
and
some
veg
good
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
too
much
for
my
liking
medium
feel
higher
med
carbonation
probably
wont
revisit
this
o
overall
a
very
solid
oktoberfest
beer
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
nothing
that
outstanding
about
it
but
its
a
good
solid
made
oktoberfest
beer
looks
like
people
have
had
big
problems
with
bottles
of
it
but
it
was
fine
on
tap
not
skunky
at
all
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
beer
worth
checking
out
though
i
liked
their
dunkel
a
lot
more
overall
4

refreshing
clean
yummy
and
satisfying
dont
miss
out
on
this
one
ontap
dont
seek
out
the
bottles
theyre
green
and
skunk
too
easily
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
in
the
middle
of
the
flavor
profile
were
the
main
distractions
here
but
there
was
enough
noble
hop
character
to
mostly
keep
this
crisp
and
drinkable
this
was
decent
but
i
think
there
are
some
better
imported
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overall
a
decent
tasting
marzen
but
its
held
back
by
the
skunking
from
the
green
bottle
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
tastes
from
the
tap
overall
drinkability
a
simple
beer
but
very
solidly
put
together
such
that
all
the
simplicity
equals
one
very
drinkable
beer
i
had
this
at
the
dayton
german
fest
earlier
this
year
and
again
now
and
in
both
cases
i
could
easily
knock
back
another
and
i
would
not
mind
doing
so
not
a
rich
in
flavor
marzen
nor
is
it
my
favorite
as
i
think
the
malt
is
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
but
it
works
as
a
good
beer
if
i
cannot
get
some
of
my
other
favorites
i
think
ill
look
to
this
one
as
my
backup
for
large
amounts
with
pork
and
other
typical
german
oktoberfest
favorites
drinkabililty
an
average
beer
in
the
german
style
oktoberfest
this
was
another
crystal
clear
blondishyellow
beer
im
going
to
try
to
have
to
dig
up
some
more
of
my
old
pics
from
germany
because
i
remember
these
being
much
darker
in
color
too
there
are
some
numbers
stamped
on
the
label
but
nothing
i
can
discern
as
a
date
in
any
case
i
think
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
until
i
can
find
my
way
back
to
germany
again
o
the
smell
was
pretty
awful
and
i
was
expecting
to
hate
this
buy
it
turned
out
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
nose
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
green
bottle
cant
wait
hoping
it
wasnt
sunked
but
alas
no
such
luck
moderate
amount
of
skunkiness
in
the
aroma
with
some
malt
background
the
skunkiness
came
over
in
the
flavor
too
would
like
to
try
this
from
the
tap
in
germany
as
i
think
it
would
be
a
really
great
beer
if
it
was
packaged
better
overall
nothing
too
special
here
they
should
ditch
the
green
bottle
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
skunky
nose
while
rather
easy
drinking
there
are
definitely
better
ones
out
there
my
fiancee
and
i
loved
it
o
a
nice
oktoberfest
beer
i
still
like
it
for
what
it
is
a
paler
and
hoppier
oktoberfest
without
that
generous
toast
character
to
the
grain
not
a
topnotch
german
example
however
still
passable
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
although
im
not
too
fond
of
floral
flavors
i
got
a
5
liter
minikeg
for
10

so
im
not
complaining
too
much
good
beer
not
exceptional
but
solid
pretty
thin
appearance
for
a
fest
beer
gold
like
a
lager
smells
of
caramel
mostly
and
a
bit
toasty

hardly
noteceable
even
though

is

mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
spiky
finish
this
is
treating
me
right
i
dont
get
any
off
flavors
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ever
made
but
in
the
class
of
very
good
beer
odpretty
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
had
it
a
bit
out
of
date
but
this
isnt
a
hop
bomb
so
i
dont
think
the
flavor
degraded
much
pretty
mild
the
skunkmetallic
taste
is
offputting
but
it
is
very
minimal
had
a
single
and
that
was
enough
o
a
drinkable
beer
without
being
spectacular
o
overall
a
decent
beer
tasty
but
nothing
remarkably
striking
about
it
the
beer
exits
the
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
towering
cap
of
white
foam
above
the
aroma
is
mainly
consists
of
bready
notes
with
some
husky
grains
mixed
in
lots
of
lightly
toasted
malt
on
the
palate
the
barley
is
clean
and
thorough
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
at
the
end
rounds
it
out
a
fine
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
nothing
particularly
to
complain
about

theres
something
cheap

it

it

it
pours
a
well

pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
twoinch
thick
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
but
fades
away
aromas
of
grains
and
some
malts
but
little
else
the
taste
is
a
sharp
grainy
bitterness
much
like
a
pilsener
the
experience
was
unexpected
not
deep
or
rich
like
american
versions
of
octoberfests
but
still
a
good
drinker
added
this
to
my
beer
bread
recipe
and
the
beer
bread
was
quite
nice
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strongly
skunky
with
nothing
else
coming
through
there
is
clearly
something
wrong
with
the
beer
but
if
the
brewer
chooses
to
use
green
bottles
they
deserve
the
bad
reviews
when
the
green
bottle
causes
skunking
the
flavor
is
not
as
skunky
and
i
get
some
grain
and
corn
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
disappointing
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
but
this
is
the
second
german
oktoberfest
i
have
had
tonight
that
has
not
been
as
good
as
sa
interpretation
this
beer
has
a
lighter
appearance
than
i
would
have
expected
nice
aroma
pleasant
but
by
no
means
overwhelming
the
taste
is
a
bit
milder
that
other
oktoberfest
beers
ive
experienced
this
did
not
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
pretty
decent
for
the
years
first
cool
day
notes
definitely
not
a
märzen
for
what
it
is
it
is
average
at
best
not
really
that
great
and
really
it
is
just
a
lower
end
german
pilsner
green
bottle
no
doubt
lead
to
the
slightly
skunked
taste
o
this
a
beer
worth
having
but
like
all
hofbrau
beers
im
left
thinking
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
it
simply
lacks
character
more
malt
more
hops
more
body
give
me
something

my
first

light
in

for
a
proper
oktoberfest
very
mild
aroma
grainy
malt
very
faint
toast
and
bread
hint
of
grassy

the
flavour
was
similarly
disappointing
the
bitterness
was
alright
on
the
light
side
but
with
good
presence
but
the
malt
character
was
very
thin
and
echoed
the
aroma
slightly
fruity
but
mild
flavour
overall
the
texture
was
decent
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
not
overly
dry
while
i
had
no
problem
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
its
a
poor
marzen
my
first
oktoberfest
and
will
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
drikability
a
realtively
smooth
drinkable
brew
however
the
taste
and
smell
are
lacking
i
would
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
decent
deviation
to
the
style
by
a
big
commercial
brewer
this
is
a
rich
munich
fest
helles
not
a
trasitional
oktoberfest
marzen
d
in
a
pinch
sure
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
session
value
not
great
this
should
be
a
buck
or
so
cheaper
a
sixer
overall
my
main
criticism
is
for
the
average
colorappearance
of
this
beer
however
the
taste
and
overall
drinkability
was
quite
good
represents
the
style
well
you
can
skip
this
one
ill
give
this
brewery
another
chance
when
i
have
the
money
because
it
seems
like
there
could
be
potential
d
fairly
easy
drinking
although
the
taste
does
not
inspire
me
to
pour
another
d
i
was
interested
to
try
an
oktoberfest
styled
beer
but
this
does
not
seem
to
tied
over
with
me
to
well
seems
like
a
maltier
adjunct
to
me
none
the
less
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
it
is
somewhat
refreshing

up

very
well
balanced
with
fresh

cookie
dough
malt
being
kept
in
check
by
a
backing
of
leafy

the
mouthfeel
is
full

a
pale
lager
with
a
brisk
carbonation
level
the
finish
is
straightforward
with
a
long
lasting
light
bitterness
and
indeed
it
also
lists
this
as
a
leading
commercial

still
its
nothing

for
the

then
again
who
should

its

nothing

looks

in

d
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
pleasant
throughout
slightly
exceeded
my
expectations
then
again
i
half
assumed
it
would
be
skunked
because
of
the
green
bottle
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
stronger
lagers
but
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
very
drinkable
beer
mild
and
pleasant
lager
a
decent
beer
but
amazingly
boring
wasnt
fond
of
the
appearance
very

no

taste
was

kinda
macrolike
grain
dry
malt
straw
just
kinda
bland
mouthfeel
was
light
and
somewhat
crisp
overall
fine
just
not
memorable
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
considering
its
meant
to
be
had
in
quality
it
fits
the
role
decent
beer
overall
golden
amber
rock
color
almost
like
a
liquid
gemstone
with
a
thick
2
inch
marshmallow
like
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
almost
straight
from
the
honey
comb
and
golden
fields
of
wheat
aroma
with
faint
spice
but
not
overwhelming
again
refreshingly
sweet
with
a
balance
of
complementary
spice
and
honey
overtone
a
malty
and
nutty
nature
make
this
a
well
balanced
pick
for
your
fall
season
mouthfeel
feel
is
very
light
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
after
drinking
one
it
would
be
essential
to
reach
for
another
to
flush
down
some
late
fall
pork
with
crackling
bbq
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
the
subtle
complexities
of
these
staple
germans
still
am
rather
confused
as
to
how
this
is
an
oktoberfest
though
so
my
review
is
as
if
this
was
a
standard
german
lager
t
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
taste
sweet
it
has
a
slight
spice
to
it
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
this
tastes
much
different
from
a
regular
hofbrau
i
would
like
to
try
side
by
side
to
see
the
difference
its
a
good
beer
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
oktoberfest
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
color
lager
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
grainy
cereal
with
more
dry
notes
then
expected
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
cereal
malt
bill
that
is
not
as
enchanting
as
i
had
expected
body
is
thinner
then
expected
with
good
carbonation
a
bit
drier
and
astringent
then
i
was
expecting
with
malt
bill
not
as
refreshing
as
expected
d
a
couple
litres
of
this
in
a
fest
hall
could
be
trouble
final
thoughts
as
my
first
oktoberfest
i
am
disappointed
to
say
the
least
i
was
expecting
a
much
fuller
and
much
richer
experience
ive
had
many
a
bad
import
lager
and
while
it
is
by
no
means
as
generic
as
they
are
that
doesnt
make
it
good
id
have
to
say
my
biggest
problem
is
it
seems
to
be
unable
to
decide
if
it
is
a
sweeter
malty
beer
or
a
richer
hoppy
beer
thumbs
down
on
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
nice
one
finger
head
and
some
sporadic
lacingthe
aroma
is
definately
very
sweet
and
malty
with
only
a
little
hop
aroma
in
the
backgroundit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
for
the
style
which
lets
it
down
in
my
opinion
with
the
aroma
definately
coming
thru
on
taste
with
sweet
caramel
malts
first
up
followed
by
a
slight
feint
hop
finish
but
for
me
evem
tho
its
very
easy
to
drink
its
definately
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
medium
gold
with
an
orange
tint
of
shining
clarity
topped
by
a
pillow
of
fizzy
white
head
the
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
coating
over
the
body
leaving
no
lace
behind
grassy
aroma
with
crackers
hints
of
lemon
and
kiss
of
sulphur
a
very
faint
whiff
of
caramel
buried
below
tastes
of
biscuity
pale
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweet
a
mild
but
firm
grassy
bitterness
dries
things
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
approaching
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
not
sure
how
well
this
fits
the
style
but
as
a
strong
pale
lager
its
really
not
bad
clear
goldstraw
with
a
big
stiff
white
head
nose
is
grassy
with
a
slight
sweet
edge
and
lots
of
herbal
notes
surprisingly
dry
quite
grassy
and
somewhat
spicy
with
a
big
husky
grain
and
a
faint
hint
of
citrus
decent
body
has
some
heft
and
a
sharp
carbonation
finish
has
a
solid
lingering
bitterness
clean
and
drinkable
its
fairly
smooth
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
but
a
little
expensive
at
3
a
bottle
but
this
a
good
start
for
the
lcbo
and
im
hoping
to
see
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
pours
a
light
coloured
body
with
initial
significant
foam
aroma
initially
a
bit
repelling
but
is
normal
after
the
bottle
has
been
open
warmed
up
and
sampled
somewhat
a
bit
of
lace
foam
sits
in
the
glass
carbonation
is
deterimental
and
adds
to
the
drying
out
of
the
palate
by
the
finish
and
beyond
in
the
aftertaste
some
malts
a
hint
of
roast
some
decent
features
still
all
in
all
500
ml
is
too
much
rarely
have
i
said
this
about
a
german
beer
it
goes
down
easy
enough
to
have
a
few
has
a
somewhat
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
being
my
first
oktoberfest
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
the
smell
is
funky
and
taste
is
lacking
the
highlight
of
this
beer
by
far
is
its
drinkability
highly
recommended
for
sessioning
but
nothing
else
huge
disappointment
d
a
bit
below
average
for
the
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
season
its
a
fantastic
looking
beer
but
has
a
mediocre
delivery
in
all
other
categories
i
wouldnt
ever
pass
up
a
free
one
but
would
never
hunt
it
down
mfd
a
decently
thick
brew
with
enough
carbonation
the
only
problem
is
that
it
isnt
a
very
good
tasting
brew
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
this
would
however
make
an
excellent
euro
lager
with
my
stomach
full
and
my
thirst
quenched
id
have
to
say
this
was
a
good
beer
especially
along
with
its
atypical
food
accompaniments
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
darker
and
maybe
a
bit
more
complex
malt
in
the
profile
but
otherwise
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
flavours
and
a
impressive
drinkability
drinks
slow
might
buy
this
as
a
pilsner
but
this
so
riddled
with
flaws
why
is
any
one
still
using
green
glass
will
try
again
if
i
can
find
it
von
fass
avoid
this
unless
you
know
its
fresh
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
syrupy
feeling
medium
carbonation
flavour
is
a
little
better
but
still
not
a
very
good
marzen
0
for
2
tonight
it
looks
like
for
some
reason
i
imagined
that
hofbraus
oktoberfest
would
have
been
one
of
the
greats
for
the
style
but
im
sadly
disappointed
this
was
crap
overall
not
a
good
export
beer
although
i
havent
been
to
munich
oktoberfest
i
suggest
trying
it
there
instead
d
very
easily
sessionable
makes
me
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
six
instead
of
a
single
despite
the
deficiencies
in
look
and
smell
i
d
have
another
one
a
decent
lager
just
not
the
epitome
of
the
oktoberfest
style
i
can
see
it
being
quite
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
cheers
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonaton
a
good
crisp
and
clean
beer
a
drinkable
beer
and
much
better
than
i
expected
after
the
pour
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
clean
crisp
and
flavorful
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
as
the
first
beer
of
the
night
some
time
if
i
do
i
will
rereview
but
i
dont
think
ill
actively
seek
this
out
this
is
an
excellent
quaffer
even
at
6
0
abv
it
goes
down
extremely
well
and
has
enough
character
and
taste
to
keep
your
interest
definitely
not
what
i
would
choose
when
picking
out
a
good
oktoberfest
d
good
drinkability
the
most
offstyle
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
but
as
a
beer
it
was
enjoyable
just
not
as
an
oktoberfest
three
beers
down
one
to
go
in
the
german
oktoberfest
invitational
see
you
tomorrow
for
the
conclusion
totally
not
what
im
used
to
in
an
oktoberfest
lager
but
pleasant
nonetheless
personally
i
would
take
a
pass
with
this
and
try
out
other
offerings
it
is
a
lot
like
regular
hofbrau
if
you
like
that
you
will
like
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
darker
okroberfests
you
might
want
to
wait
on
it
on
tap
at
the
schnitzel
platz
glendale
heights
il
served
in
a
giantssized
2
0
liter
boot
poured
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
tall
frothy
white
head
aromas
were
sweet
with
some
bread
and
caramel
hints
tastes
were
rather
weak
for
the
style
probably
sacrificed
flavor
for
drinkability
here
some
bready
malt
slight
caramel
little
hops
it
was
worth
it
to
say
ive
drank
out
of
a
giant
boot
but
this
beer
was
lacking
character
this
beer
has
euro
pale
lager
written
all
over
it
i
dont
know
how
they
can
call
it
an
oktoberfest
it
pours
a
straw
gold
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
smells
of
honey
sweetness
taste
is
also
honeylike
with
a
light
lemony
hop
im
a
big
fan
of
hofbraus
maibock
but
this
beer
is
ordinary
and
unexciting
in
every
regard
d
this
is
a
lackluster
oktoberfest
pale
grainy
skunky
too
bad
lacks
character
and
drinkability
not
really
worth
seeking
out
unless
youre
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
many
better
examples
out
there
poured
into
a
glass
beer
is
light
and
golden
color
not
what
i
expected
for
an
octoberfest
the
smell
is
lightly
hoppy
and
grainy
the
taste
is
quite
refreshing
hops
yeast
some
maltyness
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
not
what
i
expected
from
an
octoberfest
beer
but
i
was
still
quite
satisfied
rereview
after
reading
brewers
association

for
germanstyle
octoberfestwiesen

the

mfd
crisp

easy

not
bad
just
not
what
i
had
expected
from
something
labled
oktoberfest
more
like
a
quality
european
lager
without
the
skunkiness
reminded
me
of
sam
smiths
pure
brewed
lager
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
calling
itself
an
octoberfest
others
seem
to
use
vienna
or
munich
malts
leading
to
a
darker
color
and
more
caramel
malt
sweetness
i
am
told
that
is
because
other
octoberfests
became
darker
and
maltier
to
adapt
to
the
american
palate
while
hb
has
stayed
true
to
style
with
a
more
traditional
recipe
dont
know
if
this
is
true
but
i
do
know
i
really
like
this
beer
octoberfest
or
not
drinkability
all
day
thats
really
all
i
need
to
say
might
not
be
the
most
popular
style
on
ba
but
definitely
good
this
time
of
year
this
was
so
heffeweisen
like
i
had
to
ask
and
make
sure
it
wasnt
one
it
had
a
slightly
blurry
color
and
a
somewhat
esthery
aroma
and
flavor
in
general
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
seasonal
drink
especially
in
the
early
warmer
octoberfest
season
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
fast
fading
one
finger
white

not
much

speak

import
character
lightly
toasted
grainy
taste
sweetish
pale
malts
lightly
buttery
cracker
white
grape
grainy
grassyspicy
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
ofest
the
import
character
hurts
here
more
than
in
a
sturdier
imported
ofest
such
as
spaten
overall
this
is
just
okay
as
a
beer
but
not
really
in
the
same
category
as
really
good
oktoberfests
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
dont
even
know
that
i
would
have
even
guessed
it
was
an
oktoberfest
to
be
honest
average
in
every
way
nothing
bad
but
uninspired
not
the
worst
think
in
the
world
though
i
would
seek
this
out
again
d
this
oktoberfest
is
a
little
dissapointing
not
much
flavor
or
character
there
are
far
better
marzens
out
there
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
theres
a
nip
of
crispness
but
otherwise
no
real
impression
in
the
mouthfeel
pretty
tame
d
drinkability
is
definitely
good
for
a
munich
helles
just
a
little
disappointed
in
the
staatliches
hofbräuhaus
on
this
one
i
had
a
draft
version
at
a
bar
that
i
thought
was
a
little
richer
in
flavor
but
didnt
take
notes
i
wonder
if
hb
pasteurizes
their
bottles
but
not
their
kegs
on
tap
at
the
tyrolean
inn
in
ben
lomond
poured
into
a
cool
hofbrau
dimpled
mug
orangey
gold
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
cereal
grains
tangy
malt
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
character
flavor
is
similar
grainy
with
an
almost
citric
tanginess
to
it
mineral
finish
somewhat
watery
really
easy
to
drink
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
maintains
a
b
average
this
isnt
a
märzen
its
just
a
lager
i
guess
this
is
the
kind
of
oktoberfest
beer
a
heineken
drinker
would
consider
a
seasonal
brew
but
for
the
avid
drinker
this
isnt
the
type
of
märzen
one
expects
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
for
oktoberfest
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
really
to
get
excited
about
this
is
no
oktoberfest
bier
it
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
quick
disappearing
head
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
flowery
hops
some
dry
crackers
and
a
bit
of
toffee
the
body
was
thin
with
little
mouth
feel
the
tast
was
the
same
as
the
body
thin
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
tinge
of
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
this
socalled
oktoberfest
bier
was
in
other
words
just
a
normal
industrial
eurolager
with
an
oktoberfest
label
lays
straw
gold
and
pale
very
little
head
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
smell
is
perfumy
and
a
bready
grain
taste
is
light
in
the
malt
department
with
some
graininess
there
is
a
good
hop
spice
in
there
much
like
a
german
pils
it
is
light
on
the
mouth
and
light
on
the
flavor
for
an
octoberfest
good
drinkability
reminds
me
of
the
weinhenstpehaner
i
had
last
week
good
just
not
what
i
would
consider
an
octoberfest
drinkability
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
get
all
excited
about
d
a
very
fine
octoberfest
brew
here
from
hofbrau
house
would
i
expect
any
less
just
bought
a
case
and
its
already
depleted
taste
is
of
lightly
kilned
malts
and
floral
hop
flavor
both
have
a
tough
time
keeping
up
with
the
relatively
high
abv
the
beer
is
nice
crisp
and
fresh
but
i
think
i
like
all
four
of
the
other
hofbrau
offerings
i
have
tried
better
not
to
mention
it
is
not
very
marzenesque
worth
a
try
and
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
too
many
better
oktoberfests
out
there
to
buy
this
one
more
than
once
every
year
or
two
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
in
this
style
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
my
first
choice
the
clear
green
bottle
caught
me
off
guard
a
clear
light
golden
color
body
with
a
thick
short
lasting
white
head
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
grassy
hops
light
bread
dough
and
light
skunk
notes
flavor
is
slightly
sweeter
than
the
aroma
suggests
cereal
grains
floral
hops
corn
lager
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
hey
short
dry
finishmedium
body
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
oktoberfestbiers
on
the
market
you
wont
dislike
it
but
my
guess
is
that
you
wont
love
it
drinkability
this
one
is
clearly
made
for
drinkability
and
is
a
nice
average
beer
for
an
evening
out
for
dinner
and
good
conversation
with
friends
while
not
challenging
in
any
way
this
is
a
reasonably
well
made
beer
that
goes
down
easily
and
it
would
be
very
easy
to
have
a
second

third

decent
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
to
be
sure
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
see
putting
a
few
of
these
away
at
a
beerhall
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
marzen
but
still
good
recommended

very

very
intersting
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
beer
everything
is
right
where
i
want
it
to
be
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
cheers
to
oktoberfest
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
seethru
gold
body
with
onefinger
white
head
that
quickly
died
and
left
no
lacing
a
trace
amount
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
along
with
tealike
hop
bitterness
lightbodied
and
easy
drinking
there
are
trace
amounts
of
roasted
malts
along
with
caramel
and
heavier
fruity
hops
a
rather
nondescript
marzen
that
is
drying
on
the
pallete
and
for
some
reason
i
really
dont
give
such
low
scores
all
the
time
i
had
trouble
finishing
one
it
just
became
more
bitter
and
dry
as
i
drank
it
and
was
not
a
pleasant
beer
at
all
honey
blonde
golden
with
a
fluffy
pock
marked
head
that
melts
slowly
and
leaves
blobs
of
sliding
lace
on
the
glass
soft
lemon
with
a
big
whiff
of
grassy
euro
hops
and
toasted
grain
tastes
light
and
less
malty
than
most
of
the
style
with
nice
mild
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
this
tastes
more
like
a
dortmunder
lager
than
oktoberfest
light
medium
bodied
a
nice
sessionable
beer
that
seems
a
little
light
for
the
style
a
decent
oktoberfest
and
a
good
beer
for
cold
weather
hv
pours
a
body
that
is
a
very
clear
yellow
color
extremely
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
colored
head
lastingish
has
a
malty
aroma
nutty
almost
grasslike
malty
taste
nutty
lawnlike
some
fizziness
not
very
good
no
this
is
not
the
most
flavorful
marzen
around
but
if
i
were
in
germany
on
a
hot
summer
day
listening
to
umpapa
bands
and
swaying
side
to
side
with
the
other
people
at
my
table
this
is
probably
what
id
be
drinking
overall
its
not
the
best
oktoberfest
but
its
a
lot
better
than
the
ratings
would
suggest
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
1
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
theres
a
lot
of
suspended
particles
in
this
brew
smells
strongly
of
sweetearthy
malts
a
little
light
in
color
to
be
a
common
oktoberfest
a
smooth
crisp
mouth
feel
that
leaves
a
dryness
on
the
tongue
tastes
of
malt
with
a
lot
of
yeast
lager
taste
theres
a
metallic
taste
as
well
that
is
not
very
pleasing
on
the
palate
overall
not
that
great
at
all
overall
if
youre
contemplating
picking
this
up
save
a
couple
bucks
and
buy
heinekin
or
becks
this
is
almost
dead
on
becks
md
surprisingly
smooth
on
the
palate
way
less
fizzy
as
the
appearance
suggests
while
the
flavour
comes
at
an
equal
level
as
the
body
about
medium
to
full
overall
i
find
this
a
wellcrafted
and
deliciously
malty
strong
helles
lager
balanced
by
an
impressive
input
of
german
hops
in
a
sense
this
is
a
superquaffable
lager
to
me
thanks
to
the
lovely
hoppiness
and
a
soft
texture
bright
gold
pour
with
a
fizzy
white
head
metal
caramel
sugar
and
grass
in
the
aroma
butter
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
heineken
hop
skunkiness
look
i
know
this
beer
is
not
supposd
to
be
as
fullbodied
as
the
others
as
this
is
to
be
drunk
is
large
quantities
at
oktoberfest
i
just
wish
it
tasted
better
drinkability
this
is
very
sessionable
i
wish
i
picked
this
up
in
the
earlier
months
because
i
overlooked
it
too
much
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
satisfying
for
the
last
october
for
the
year
im
going
to
miss
them
but
im
glad
i
had
this
one
to
top
off
some
great
marzens
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
year
for
what
its
worth
i
think
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
its
got
a
nice
full
flavor
and
its
pretty
crisp
i
dont
know
how
i
would
describe
it
as
an
oktoberfest
beer
though
if
i
recall
i
thought
those
were
supposed
to
be
a
bit
thickermore
dense
thats
not
the
case
with
this
beer
but
its
still
worth
checking
out
this
is
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
i
can
not
find
any
of
the
toasted
nutty
malty
quality
as
in
most
oktoberfest
brews
instead
im
thinking
of
an
uber
pilsner
flavor
is
crisp
and
light
making
this
one
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
even
if
it
falls
short
of
the
style
not
bad
but
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
on
this
style
it
has
a
straw
brass
yellow
body
which
is
weird
for
a
marzen
from
munich
the
head
is
just
barely
offwhite
it
smells
sweet
and
grassy
and
maybe
just
a
little
skunk
it
has
a
grainy
and
oddly
sweet
taste
that
is
followed
by
a
great
but
mild
hoppy
flavor
it
has
an
average
thin
mouthfeel
mouth
sweet
and
bready
finishing
dry
with
mild
spicy
gentile
hops
medium
body
with
a
very
soft
mouth
sensation
serving
type
onbottle
drinkability
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
an
abomination
of
the
style
steer
clear
d
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
really
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
the
flavor
is
fine
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
dark
and
rich
as
a
lot
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
drinks
more
like
a
standard
lager
to
me
with
maybe
a
bit
more
sweetness
would
be
great
for
tailgating
though
decent
but
not
spectacular
for
the
style
pours
a
golden
clear
sunshine
with
an
argueable
toasted
hue
not
much
ofa
head
but
sme
good
bubbling
the
color
makesno
distinction
between
an
octoberfest
and
a
german
pilsner
hardly
any
toasted
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
no
sweetness
and
a
lot
more
tetnanger
hops
than
should
be
crisp
palate
but
no
sweetess
or
sooth
very
dissapointed
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
especially
since
my
favorite
beer
is
hofbrau
dunkel
on
tap
im
not
sure
if
it
is
because
of
lightheat
damage
but
i
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
two
bottles
the
other
four
went
down
the
drain
the
thick
carbonated
head
and
citrus
smell
quickly
gave
way
to
pure
skunk
and
bitterness
with
a
horrible
aftertaste
i
assume
that
i
just
got
a
bad
sixpack
on
the
brighter
side
im
going
to
the
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
in
two
weeks
and
will
try
one
on
tap
to
give
it
another
chance
d
drinks
closer
to
pilsner
urquell
versus
an
oktoberfest
not
very
drinkable
for
an
okto
the
taste
was
a
little
warming
and
started
with
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
hoppy
dry
bitterness
a
beer
that
is
made
for
drinking
in
half
liters
it
becomes
well
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
expect
a
light
pilsner
maltiness
this
beer
is
subtle
in
its
character
mostly
malt
driven
clean
fermentation
a
short
dry
aftertaste
d
could
put
a
couple
away
quite
moreish
overall
its
a
decent
beer
and
the
slight
skunk
didnt
derail
my
enjoyment

i
would
drink
this
i
like
it
but
it
is
not
my
first
pick
for
a
marzenofest
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
decent
white
head
my
total
impression
is
that
the
brew
is
on
the
side
of
a
plain
jane
aroma
is
subtle
with
gentle
notes
of
spices
quaff
is
also
along
those
lines
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
in
the
finish
but
overall
well
balanced
although
kinda
weak
nothing
outstanding
with
this
brew
but
easy
drinking
in
the
cool
fall
weather
drinkability
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
an
unoffensive
taste
albeit
odd
i
do
like
some
deviation
from
the
style
in
beers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
jumping
ship
completely
still
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
ease
dfairly
high
its
a
nice
brew
that
i
have
no
trouble
drinking
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
certainly
drinkable
but
but
it
would
not
be
a
standout
in
any
style
let
alone
oktoberfests
from
which
i
expect
different
things
not
that
they
should
be
or
are
carbon
copies
for
a
helles
oktoberfest
this
is
pretty
good
the
taste
is
similar
zesty
sweetly
and
spicly
alcoholic
raisin
and
grape
with
a
creamy
butter
quality
a
lot
of
bread
and
some
hay
and
grass
hints
of
grain
grass
herbs
lemon
zest
and
pear
its
zesty
with
great
balance
and
a
finish
thats
tingly
zesty
lightly
bitter
with
warm
alcoholic
bite
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
similar
to
a
blonde
ale
or
dare
i
say
american
macro
has
zero
taste
to
it
at
all
and
is
just
way
too
thin
in
the
body
and
has
average
drinkability
itd
be
hard
to
tell
this
from
a
becks
or
st
pauli
girl
its
just
that
runofthemill
im
sure
theres
a
lot
of
history
with
this
beer
but
its
a
big
miss
for
me
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
feel
it
is
lacking
in
the
malt
department
for
an
oktoberfest
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
cultured
yeast
almost
like
a
tripel
but
with
earthy
caramel
and
nutty
malts
it
tasted
like
copper
and
lemon
hops
with
cultured
yeast
and
a
bit
of
bitter
apples
and
barley
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
clean
and
drinkable
but
it
was
certainly
not
the
best
tasting
beer
it
needed
more
classic
european
malt
to
give
its
character
more
depth
and
balance
d
i
rate
the
drinkability
very
high
on
this
beer
because
of
all
the
great
flavor
and
the
average
alcohol
content
score
yourself
a
case
before
i
buy
all
of
them
up
drinkability
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
more
d
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
dont
have
a
problem
drinking
but
theres
definitely
better
beers
out
there
smell
is
slightly
grainy
but
pretty
weak
taste
is
similar
this
seems
more
like
a
german
pilsner
than
an
festbier
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
no
complaints
drinkability
is
moderate
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
another
one
of
these
but
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
would
never
turn
it
down
mouthfeeldrinkability
while
the
carbonation
is
aggressive
it
really
is
perfect
for
the
sausage
lifting
the
grease
and
fat
from
the
tongue
and
leaving
a
gripping
dry
bitterness
for
the
next
sip
the
lighter
body
of
this
example
really
adds
points
for
drinkability
and
this
will
absolutely
be
a
contender
for
the
upcoming
allday
festivals
for
this
season
a
nice
malty
lager
a
little
less
festive
than
i
expected
d
if
you
are
on
a
quest
to
consume
all
the
octoberfest
beer
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
fall
my
personal
goal
then
by
all
means
drink
away
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
pass
it
over
good
beer
ya
i
paid
ten
bucks
for
six
of
these
oh
well
its
better

overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
and
i
could
drink
a
few
but
i
am
confused
as
to
where
the
oktoberfestbier
part
comes
into
play
give
it
a
shot
if
you
have
the
chance
d
very
drinkable
a
solid
choice
for
the
style
had
a
liter
during
the
kegtapping
at
the
hofbrau
house
in
milwaukee
d
a
nice
session
beer
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
i
could
drink
this
all
night
no
body
no
flavor
to
texture
carbinated
water
mixed
with
alcohol
however
i
do
not
believe
this
to
be
a
good
representation
of
this
style
a
drinkable
beer
certainly
not
near
the
best
i
would
call
this
mediocre
but
a
fine
beer
for
an
outdoor
festival
with
lots
of
people
milling
around
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
consume
it
at
home
thin
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
good
clarity
personally
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
lighter
fest
style
if
i
want
a
hellesspezialexportetc
there
are
plenty
of
good
offerings
and
most
fest
tents
already
have
them
when
i
want
a
marzenoktoberfest
id
prefer
the
original
style
theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
this
brew
when
categorized
properly
but
when
they
scale
back
a
style
i
enjoy
its
almost
like
a
conflict
of
interest
overall
this
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
oktoberfest
style
it
isnt
much
different
from
any
other
light
german
lager
d
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
but
a
total
miss
style
wise
for
me
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
fairly
ordinary
beer
with
even
its
best
attributes
compromised
this
is
not
a
very
good
oktoberfest
with
so
many
others
besting
this
all
around
m
d
crisp
and
refreshing
fairly
straight
forward
not
too
bad
but
among
the
style
choices
not
anything
extraordinary
not
bad
not
as
malty
as
i
would
like
in
the
nose
or
flavor
lighter
color
than
most
oktoberfest
beers
not
much
in
aroma
but
drinkable
d
overall
i
was
a
tad
bit
disappointed
by
this
the
flavor
was
rather
bland
theres
a
good
herbal
hop
bite
in
the
end
which
is
one
of
the
few
highlights
of
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
festbier
poured
a
goldenyellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
aroma
had
a
bit
of
skunk
to
it
also
was
kind
of
grainy
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
the
nose
flavor
was
malty
with
just
a
small
bit
of
hops
coming
through
not
much
lacing
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
drinkability
was
ok
decent
beer
hmmm
mine
came
in
a
green
bottle
and
was
slightly
skunky
im
pretty
sure
somebody
poured
a
heineken
or
red
stripe
into
this
hofbrau
bottle
bc
that
is
exactly
what
it
tasted
like
nothing
like
an
oktoberfestmarzen
ive
had
before
looks
and
smells
like
a
pale
lager
some
yeastiness
some
light
malt
and
faint
bitterness
and
while
not
offensive
aside
from
the
light
skunking
this
is
a
horrible
example
of
the
style
and
not
worth
getting
at
all
d
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
marzen
beers
i
gladly
accept
this
change
though
i
have
no
idea
whether
its
authentic
or
not
its
sooo
german
so
it
must
be
being
fortunate
enough
to
get
this
straight
from
the
warehouse
was
a
plus
d
run
of
the
mill
oktoberfest
i
feel
paulaner
is
better
this
may
be
a
bit
thin
nonetheless
its
fresh
and
crisp
flavours
give
it
good
drinkability
pours
golden
into
a
pint
glass
with
the
head
disappearing
so
quickly
that
i
didnt
have
a
chance
to
notice
its
qualities
smells
a
bit
of
skunk
at
first
then
some
grains
taste
redeems
the
beer
somewhat
after
the
lackluster
effort
in
the
looks
and
smell
department
you
get
some
grains
bolder
than
expected
malts
and
some
yeast
with
a
little
honey
sweetness
as
it
goes
down
not
your
typical
oktoberfest
but
might
make
for
a
good
summer
session
beer
to
replace
a
less
tasty
lager
that
youve
become
bored
with
then
again
it
might
not
id
have
another
tastes
like
a
lager
and
goes
down
very
smooth
just
as
smooth
as
bud
light
but
with
flavor
that
doesnt
fizz
in
your
mouth
its
just
an
outstanding
beer
to
drink
easily
it
has
flavor
but
its
more
of
a
subdued
one
and
the
best
comparison
i
can
make
would
be
to
a
light
lager
but
that
isnt
fair
to
this
beer
since
it
goes
down
even
smoother
than
those
do
and
doesnt
feel
heavy
at
all
all
in
all
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
this
beer
to
store
because
im
going
to
have
to
wait
until
next
year
to
buy
some
more
i
poured
this
strange
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
pale
and
did
not
look
at
all
like
a
octoberfestt
beer
it
poured
a
fine
white
bubbly
head
that
decayed
rather
quicky
lacing
was
nonexistant
the
beer
smelled
skunky
and
sweet
taste
was
not
bad
though
it
was
light
and
reffreshing
but
not
very
octoberfestish
at
all
i
would
buy
again
but
not
in
the
fall
this
is
like
a
summer
beer
definitely
not
the
best
oktoberfest
out
there
but
not
bad
at
all
at
least
on
tap
the
bottle
pours
with
a
quickly
fading
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
munich
malt
and
haller
hops
with
an
almost
skunk
but
not
quite
the
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
the
hops
take
the
back
seat
overall
a
great
session
beer
disappointingly
green
bottle
pours
out
a
tarnished
golden
body
with
a
small
loose
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last
long
skunky
hops
over
honeycovered
biscuits
and
cookie
dough
spicy
hop
bitterness
up
front
cookie
dough
and
apple
malts
midpalate
apple
sweetness
crescendos
into
a
slightly
skunky
spicy
hop
finish
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
probably
better
fresh
at
the
hofbrauhaus
d
easy
to
put
back
but
it
doesnt
exactly
leave
me
wanting
more
d
this
is
a
fairly
average
oktoberfest
it
smelled
and
looked
like
an
average
euro
pale
lager
but
it
tasted
better
than
that
drinkability
this
is
meant
for
mass
consumption
at
an
oktoberfest
and
i
think
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
party
in
fact
im
going
to
check
into
getting
a
keg
of
this
for
my
next
gettogether
i
was
disappointed
when
i
first
poured
this
lighter
then
other
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
a
dark
yellow
then
the
smell
also
seemed
a
bit
skunky
however
when
i
tasted
it
i
was
surprised
again
it
has
a
nice
balance
however
not
as
sweet
and
malty
as
some
other
oktoberfest
beers
mouthfeel
was
light
but
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
drinkability
was
alright
as
well
overall
i
probably
wont
seek
out
this
beer
again
as
there
are
better
marzen
out
there
mainly
paulaner
and
hackerpschorr
but
i
probably
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
pours
out
a
medium
toned
honey
with
sufficient
bubble
action
and
a
thinnish
white
head
with
quite
a
lot
of
staying
power
leaves
some
streaks
of
thick
lace
smells
of
light
cracker
maltiness
faint
sulphurdms
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
flavor
is
rather
straightforward
clean
malty
bready
and
with
a
nice
touch
of
finishing
bitter
sweetish
overall
with
a
simple
syrup
flavor
somewhere
in
there
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
but
a
bit
sticky
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
obtrusive
solid
overall
but
ill
spend
my
money
on
other
oktoberfests
in
the
future
out
of
a
green
bottle
it
pours
a
golden
strawlike
color
that
is
more
reminisant
of
a
macro
lager
heinieken
or
pabst
has
a
quick
disappearing
head
smells
grassy
not
malty
like
a
summer
lawn
mower
beer
unfortunatly
i
can
already
smell
the
skunkiness
from
the
light
polution
this
taste
more
like
a
macro
german
lager
than
a
marzen
comparing
this
to
other
ofest
hacker
spaten
paulaner
this
is
weak
has
some
hop
to
it
but
little
sweetness
mouthfell
is
fair
high
carbonation
leaves
the
palate
dry
overall
as
an
ofest
i
am
not
a
fan
as
a
lager
this
is
not
bad
this
is
a
high
quality
lawn
mower
beer
ill
atribute
some
of
the
faults
to
the
green
bottle
hoping
this
is
better
on
tap
not
my
first
or
even
second
choice
as
a
marzen
recommended
im
a
little
disappointed
i
expect
more
from
german
beer
perhaps
the
stupid
green
bottle
had
something
to
do
with
it
light
polution
again
the
appearance
wasnt
up
to
the
usual
german
standard
it
looks
like
a
slightlydarker
budweiser
not
much
head
the
smells
consists
of
hoppy
and
malty
skunk
tail
green
bottle
the
taste
seems
a
little
bitter
and
it
the
beer
seems
a
tad
overcarbonated
im
sure
this
beer
is
much
better
when
drank
from
a
giant
oktoberfest
mug
in
münchen
deutschland
ive
got
to
believe
that
this
beer
is
better
and
that
i
just
got
a
crappy
six
pack
the
carbonation
is
quite
strong
large
bubbles
the
liquid
is
creamy
overall
imho
this
makes
for
a
great
pilsner
but
it
seems
a
bit
mislabled
as
a
marzen
this
seems
close
to
the
style
of
beer
that
tends
to
be
served
in
the
oktoberfest
tents
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
traditional
marzen
when
i
bought
it
d
a
fair
oktoberfest
not
a
bad
beer
but
pretty
average
and
standard
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
its
better
than
a
lot
of
the
stuff
youre
going
to
find
out
there
not
overly
offensive
just
very
plain
and
heineken
like
green
bottles
are
no
good
not
recommended
okay
but
not
really
what
i
want
when
picking
a
märzen
seems
to
be
a
helleslike
beer
with
a
bit
of
additional
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
the
malt
does
come
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
though
but
it
still
needs
more
pours
an
almost
straw
like
golden
color
with
an
average
white
head
rather
dissappointing
for
an
oktoberfest
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
grassy
nobel
hops
not
much
malt
detected
the
beer
has
a
cracker
like
malt
base
maybe
a
touch
sweeter
than
their
munchen
helles
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
presence
where
are
the
caramel
malts
the
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
and
well
balanced
this
brew
drinks
well
and
is
very
sessionable
but
misses
the
mark
for
an
oktoberfest
i
dont
see
that
much
if
any
difference
between
this
and
their
helles
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
obviously
meant
as
a
session
beer
its
got
a
good
kick
for
a
session
beer
with
the
6
abv
it
warms
the
palate
a
bit
hallo
oktoberfest
the
body
is
lighttomedium
smooth
inoffensive
this
is
a
mild
easy
drinking
ofest
its
an
allround
lighter
interpretation
of
the
style
while
this
is
decent
there
are
better
tastier
ofests
to
choose
over
this
one
imo
i
guess
hofbräus
oktoberfest
2007
deviates
a
little
bit
from
the
mainstream
oktoberfest
beer
for
one
thing
it
has
a
little
higher
abv
6
5
but
its
also
more
plain
yellow
as
compared
to
a
the
usual
copper
yellow
colour
of
märzenbier
the
smell
is
citric
and
bready
and
with
that
dishrag
whiff
this
kind
of
beer
should
have
the
taste
is
bitter
fruity
and
with
a
lot
of
bread
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
some
alcohol
too
lots
of
carbonation
i
had
expected
a
thinner
oktoberfest
from
hofbräu
but
its
really
fruity
and
similar
to
the
czech
starobrnos
baron
trenck
the
higher
abv
does
the
trick
i
think
my
oktoberfest
favourite
this
year
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
but
not
bad
to
be
honest
this
serves
as
a
decent
euro
lager
something
thats
certainly
drinkable
if
you
want
a
lighter
beer
but
as
an
oktoberfest
its
unacceptable
this
is
probably
one
of
the
lightest
colored
oktoberfests
ive
seen
it
pours
bright
golden
almost
strawlike
with
minimal
lacing
the
little
bit
of
head
it
does
have
disappears
rather
quickly
it
has
a
sweet
smelling
munich
malt
aroma
at
first
but
the
noble
hops
start
to
become
more
apparent
after
a
while
the
hops
give
it
a
nice
bite
once
it
hits
your
mouth
but
it
ends
with
that
malty
sweetness
not
very
fully
bodied
but
this
makes
it
very
quaffable
as
a
beer
its
amazing
for
session
drinking
i
could
see
this
being
my
goto
drink
for
say
several
games
of
beer
pong
for
example
however
im
disappointed
inasmuch
as
this
is
considered
a
marzen
allow
me
to
be
a
slave
to
the
style
for
a
moment
i
was
really
hoping
for
that
dark
heavy
roast
and
malt
flavor
for
the
season
overall
a
decent
beer
but
ive
had
better
oktoberfests
decent
enough
drinkability
and
decent
anough
beeer
but
im
not
sure
what
this
is
it
sure
isnt
an
oktoberfest
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
id
rather
have
other
octoberfest
beers
this
beer
pours
unlike
any
other
oktoberfest
i
have
tried
which
makes
me
leery
right
off
the
bat
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
lagerish
aroma
of
mild
hops
and
malt
lightbodied
with
hops
and
grainy
malt
flavors
that
dont
have
much
staying
power
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
touches
of
citrus
below
average
across
the
board
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
rocky
head
the
smell
is
strong
of
hops
the
taste
is
initially
bitter
from
the
hops
but
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
quickly
tasted

resulting
in
a
nicely
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
has
a
slight
carbonation
bite
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
brew
and
find
it
light
and
very
drinkable
drinkabilitynotes
wellcrafted
to
be
sure
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
those
expecting
an
oktoberfest
as
the
label
states
that
being
said
this
is
competently
brewed
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
could
easily
put
a
few
away
subtle
aromas
of
the
marzen
malts
ubtle
flavors
as
well
a
nice
light
crisp
easy
drinking
brew
not
too
much
going
on
but
just
enough
that
i
could
sit
around
and
suck
these
down
overall
this
was
not
a
good
beer
whether
from
poor
storage
or
poor
brewing
i
dont
know
but
either
way
i
wont
drink
it
again
while
you
could
session
this
beer
i
would
choose
a
better
beer
overall
not
terribly
impressed
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
kind
of
a
burgundy
orange
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
but
nice
lacing
smells
quite
grainy
and
a
touch
spicy
but
mostly
grainy
taste
is
light
on
the
mouth
sweet
malts
but
they
seem
a
touch
muted
smooth
though
and
enjoyable
bitter
hops
provide
a
dry
finish
some
alcohol
notes
creep
in
as
this
beer
warms
a
bit
not
the
most
robust
or
flavorful
ofests
but
one
of
the
more
drinkable
sessionable
ofests
i
have
had
even
with
the
abv
level
i
think
tap
must
be
way
better
than
bottles
for
this
beer
and
most
hofbrau
beers
light
body
and
high
carbonation
in
standard
eurolager
fashion
overall
a
pretty
boring
and
inoffensive
beer
just
an
average
beer
there
are
definitly
better
in
the
style
this
one
just
had
nothing
to
stand
out
good
for
a
very
heavy
german
meal
as
an
offset
in
tastes
if
you
see
this
on
a
shelf
look
for
a
different
beer
in
the
style
maltybready
a
bit
syrupy
even
with
crisptasting
water
struggling
in
the
background
overall
feels
unbalanced
too
much
carbonation
and
a
little
too
dull
easy
to
drink
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
fluffy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
theres
some
citrusy
notes
to
the
hop
aroma
theres
also
some
skunkiness
there
damn
green
bottles
tastes
fairly
dry
with
a
lot
of
hoppy
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
of
any
kind
still
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
sort
of
creamy
it
sorta
bubbles
up
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
nice
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
get
it
again
d
not
reccomended
a
decent
beer
but
the
alcoholic
aftertaste
very
much
hurts
the
overall
score
in
this
category
like
all
the
hofbrau
beers
ive
tried
this
is
absolutely
unexceptional
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
as
it
lacks
some
defining
character
but
one
that
you
could
sit
around
and
drink
for
a
while
nothing
offensive
just
be
careful
to
get
it
out
of
the
case
as
the
green
glass
bottles
will
allow
it
to
be
light
struck
and
ruin
the
aroma
and
flavor
quickly
if
the
bottles
are
exposed
to
light
overall
my
least
favorite
oktoberfest
brew
but
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
has
a
fresh
malt
flavor
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
noble
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
have
much
depth
i
like
the
malt
flavors
and
if
the
hops
were
a
little
lighter
or
had
some
depth
to
them
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
revisited
this
10908
not
good
stuff
d
rare
drain
pour
could
have
finished
itit
was
merely
insipid
rather
than
offensivebut
id
much
rather
spend
my
time
on
something
else
pours
yellow
with
a
poor
white
head
smells
grainy
with
a
hint
of
apples
and
some
skunk
is
present
too
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
and
sweet
with
some
bitterness
and
some
skunk
and
sulphur
tones
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
suprisingly
heavy
but
not
extremely
so
drinkability
is
decent
despite
its
flaws
ok
so
this
is
oktoberfest
beer
right
this
beer
would
pass
for
pilsner
probably
a
pretty
fair
pilsner
but
oktoberfest
this
almost
seems
like
a
mix
up
at
the
brewery
to
me
i
gotta
give
low
marks
just
based
on
style
not
so
much
because
its
a
bad
beer
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
light
grainy
aroma
with
a
bit
of
offputting
skunkiness
as
others
have
mentioned
the
taste
is
more
like
your
average
eurolager
i
found
the
sweetness
to
be
a
bit
too
heavy
and
the
skunkiness
was
present
enough
to
not
be
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
chore
to
drink
i
dont
recommend
it
d
this
isnt
what
i
think
of
when
i
want
a
oktoberfest
this
looks
too
pale
and
not
very
sweet
abv
is
there
but
this
smacks
of
euro
pale
lager
rather
than
marzen
we
shall
call
this
ofest
light
12
oz
green
bottle
code
on
the
back
label
is
l152f
1121
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
exactly
what
you
may
picture
for
an
oktoberfest
thick
frothy
white
head
holds
very
well
slight
sulfur
and
grassy
aroma
along
with
pale
bready
malt
good
amount
of
bready
malt
greets
you
then
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
herbal
and
grassy
hops
a
bit
sweet
pretty
clean
and
balanced
leans
toward
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinakble
d
not
bad
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
follow
up
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
on
draft
fresh
at
hofbrauhaus
in
las
vegas
this
past
weekend
far
superior
to
the
bottled
version
im
sure
a
lot
of
that
is
atmosphere
thats
why
im
not
fully
reviewing
it
but
generally
much
better
still
not
my
favorite
though
did
they
put
the
wrong
beer
in
this
oktoberfest
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
very
special
it
tastes
like
any
boring
bland
beer
i
dont
recommend
looking
for
this
if
it
is
in
front
of
you
it
is
okay
to
consume
but
it
isnt
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
served
in
an
authentic
halfliter
stein
golden
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
crisp
malty
aroma
taste
did
not
strike
me
a
being
a
marzen
to
be
honest
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
pilsener
clean
light
flavor
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
fairly
drinkablebut
it
tasted
closer
to
a
stella
artois
than
an
oktoberfest
good
to
see
the
oktoberfests
back
in
session
though
hofbrauhaus
left
me
a
bit
disapointed
i
was
expecting
a
rich
bready
malty
strong
flavorful
brew
thought
the
strength
shined
the
bready
mediumfull
texture
rich
malts
left
me
wanting
more
paler
straw
than
expected
but
the
head
retention
and
lacing
is
on
par
aromas
of
majorily
grain
and
an
estery
fruitiness
that
was
unexpected
tastes
more
fruity
and
grainlike
than
that
classic
rich
bready
caramel
malt
that
i
really
wanted
the
beer
is
left
a
little
too
standardpilsnerlike
the
strength
was
there
leaving
an
alcohol
flavor
and
mild
heat
in
the
finish
just
a
touch
of
grainbite
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
im
really
dissapointed
by
this
one
usually
hofbrauhaus
has
some
nice
beers
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
this
borderline
tastes
like
a
macro
offering
perhaps
this
is
the
lighter
oktoberfest
that
is
served
traditionaly
in
german
as
opposed
to
the
heavier
version
we
get
perhaps
it
just
isnt
that
good
of
a
beer
i
really
liked
this
and
would
probably
get
it
again
especially
if
it
was
on
sale
interesting
take
on
the
style
much
lighter
in
color
than
other
german
ofests
not
much
aroma
but
traces
of
malt
taste
was
the
most
interesting
item
here
alot
more
balanced
than
the
usual
german
ofest
which
are
usually
over
the
top
malt
this
one
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thinner
than
other
ofests
good
drinkability
i
like
this
one
even
though
it
is
not
spot
on
for
the
style
appears
a
light
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
leaves
specks
of
lacing
around
my
pint
aroma
has
sweet
apple
notes
with
german
noble
grassy
hop
notes
not
the
typical
roastier
nutty
american
interpretation
of
this
style
but
okay
flavor
has
a
clean
mild
sweetness
low
hop
bitterness
but
with
some
good
hop
flavor
that
grassy
herbal
character
is
great
with
a
touch
of
cereal
presence
i
think
i
could
drink
this
by
the
liter
at
an
actual
o
fest
much
more
so
than
the
caramel
malt
infused
versions
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
good
sturdy
carbonation
flows
smoothly
drinkability
is
quality
like
i
said
not
as
complex
as
or
quaffable
as
some
but
you
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
with
no
worries
overall
a
very
drinkable
oktober
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
its
german
bretheren
which
really
appealed
to
me
this
beer
is
just
kind
of
blah
for
me
so
accordingly
i
dont
have
much
desire
to
drink
more
also
the
smell
is
a
bit
offputting
this
is
a
good
marzen
mine
might
be
slightly
skunked
damn
i
wish
europe
would
stop
using
clear
or
green
bottles
i
am
not
sure
because
normally
i
dont
like
lagers
anyway
but
when
i
get
past
the
slight
and
i
mean
slight
funk
this
is
very
pleasant
and
i
will
enjoy
finishing
off
the
6
pack
i
guess
i
thought
that
perhaps
a
german
oktoberfest
would
be
closet
to
the
style
definition
either
all
the
others
ive
tried
have
it
wrong
or
this
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
pours
very
very
light
colored
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipates
in
time
way
too
light
for
an
oktoberfest
or
at
least
what
i
think
of
as
an
oktoberfest
smell
is
quite
hoppy
just
this
side
of
skunked
with
a
slight
malt
note
that
at
warmer
temperatures
starts
smelling
more
like
rice
on
the
palate
sweet
at
first
with
the
malts
but
very
quickly
this
changes
over
into
some
zippy
hop
characteristics
much
more
in
place
in
a
german
pilsner
than
an
oktoberfest
overall
this
one
doesnt
fit
the
style
to
my
mind
and
the
execution
of
whats
here
isnt
great
either
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
is
still
solid
and
quite
nice
a
unique
oktober
and
one
that
is
quite
refreshing
solid
beer
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
thourougly
worst
thing
about
it
is
it
doesnt
smell
like
much
doesnt
look
like
a
typical
oktoberfest
either
looks
like
a
pilser
pours
a
decent
head
though
but
it
tastes
outstanding
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
bananacaramel
malts
round
this
one
out
with
a
crisp
smooth
taste
no
metalic
background
an
outstanding
brew
here
very
malty
and
sweet
and
different
than
other
oktobers
in
its
own
right
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
i
think
that
i
was
fortunate
to
get
a
pretty
fresh
example
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
there
is
some
subtle
warming
after
drinking
letting
you
know
that
there
is
some
power
lurking
within
this
beer
drinkability
i
really
cant
say
that
much
about
this
beer
because
there
wasnt
much
going
on
in
this
beer
it
was
ok
but
if
you
want
a
bottle
just
be
a
little
cautious
because
its
a
green
bottle
and
could
have
been
exposed
to
too
much
light
not
a
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
again
lagers
get
pretty
shitty
pr
and
i
think
this
beer
redresses
the
issues
in
an
ever
so
small
way
comments
this
was
an
average
oktoberfestbier
ive
had
many
better
but
i
think
a
lot
of
the
problem
with
this
one
was
its
freshness
i
questioned
its
freshness
but
there
was
no
date
on
the
bottle
to
tell
i
think
this
would
be
a
much
different
beer
had
it
been
sampled
in
munich
fresh
by
the
time
it
made
it
to
my
lbs
it
tasted
sort
of
tired
d
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
not
far
off
from
hofbrau
original
not
what
i
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
but
a
good
solid
beer
hofbrau
oktoberfestbier
to
beat
a
dead
horse
is
a
lousy
example
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
have
picked
it
as
an
oktoberfest
if
given
five
guesses
in
spite
of
all
that
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
whether
or
not
its
good
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
not
this
is
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
i
can
definitely
see
pounding
endless
giant
steins
of
this
next
time
im
in
munich
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
beer
nice
and
refreshing
even
if
it
is
a
little
lighter
then
it
should
be
thanks
go
to
merlin48
for
this
sample
12
ounce
bottle
hofbräu
munchen
oktoberfest
is
another
one
of
the
beers
served
at
munichs
oktoberfest
that
is
available
here
in
the
u
s
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
which
normally
isnt
a
good
sign
the
appearance
once
poured
threw
me
off
as
well
it
was
a
pale
golden
color
that
appeared
and
smelled
much
more
like
a
pilsner
than
the
more
common
copperyhued
fest
brews
however
the
taste
was
amazingly
complex
and
enjoyable
it
was
tangy
with
honey
sweetness
tealike
tannins
providing
a
contrasting
earthiness
and
decisively
german
hops
providing
a
mildly
bitter
finish
the
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
danced
in
my
mouth
and
the
result
was
altogether
quite
impressive
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
better
it
would
be
straight
from
the
tap
in
munich
overall
the
hofbrau
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
its
gentle
on
the
palate
and
is
flavorful
enough
to
be
mildly
enjoyable
my
two
reviews
have
generally
not
been
kind
to
this
and
i
dont
see
a
need
to
revisit
for
a
third
i
might
try
again
if
on
tap
thats
it
there
are
other
oktoberfests
available
even
locally
that
i
vastly
prefer
over
this
one
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
didnt
make
quite
the
impression
that
the
paulaner
did
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
12

there
are
some
streaks
of

on

hoppy
for
an
ofest
with
spicy
and
floral
notes
dominating
a
subdued
caramel
malt
base
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
considerable
carbonation
and
a
slight
hops
bite
taste
is
somewhat
like
a
pils
or
helles
with
a
dominant
floral
bitterness
caramel
maltiness
is
very
understated
not
exactly
to
style
but
very
drinkable
no
skunky
character
from
the
green
bottle
thankfully
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
looks
a
little
weaker
than
i
had
expected
the
nose
has
a
malty
presence
maybe
kind
of
grassy
or
grainy
and
im
actually
pulling
some
hops
scents
out
of
this
one
as
well
the
taste
is
great
malty
and
quite
hoppy
for
an
oktoberfest
im
not
sure
it
tastes
true
to
its
style
but
beerforbeer
it
tastes
pretty
darn
good
pleasant
aftertaste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
carbonation
it
goes
down
the
hatch
pretty
well
too
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
really
love
the
flavor
im
sure
its
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
supposed
to
portray
but
its
refreshing
and
tastes
good
nonetheless
for
me
it
was
an
average
representation
if
not
slightly
below
average
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
like
to
try
this
one
from
a
keg
or
at
least
a
light
shielded
bottle
but
as
this
was
a
guaranteed
fresh
sample
i
just
cannot
rate
it
higher
even
though
i
can
sort
of
see
what
this
beer
wants
to
be
the
mouth
is
decent
with
good
carbonation
very
easy
drinker
while
this
may
be
a
bit
on
the
light
side
and
an
example
of
the
new
style
oktoberfest
it
is
still
very
tasty
and
well
done
overall
impression
a
fine
beer
very
drinkable
clean
well
crafted
just
not
very
festive
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
sample

white

maltyness
litle
lemonsour
orange
like
yeastfruit
and
low
hopnose
in
the
back
completing
the
overal
fresh
nose
in
taste
malt
is
dominating
giving
it
a
full
flavour
alcoholic
and
dry
caracter
but
with
sweet
hint
from
maltyness
mouthfeel
is
great
as
almost
all
real
oktoberfestbeers
from
munich
are
ultra
clean
and
good
but
not
to
high
carbonisation
but
with
full
hoppy
and
malty
taste
drinkability
is
then
off
course
also
fine
imo
overall
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
im
sure
ill
have
several
of
one
high
point
is
it
does
taste
good
for
a
lighter
type
ale
the
color
is
honey
golden
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
the
head
is
averagesized
and
creamy
white
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
grainy
malts
seems
more
like
a
mixture
of
german
pils
and
helles
aromas
than
the
maltiness
of
an
marzen
the
taste
is
of
lighter
bodied
malt
sweetness
with
grain
flavor
running
throughout
a
touch
of
minty
hops
gives
this
a
little
more
personality
this
seems
more
like
a
big
helles
than
an
true
ofest
not
bad
at
all
but
dont
expect
a
big
bready
marzen
the
first
of
what
will
be
many
oktoberfest
beers
this
year
poured
out
to
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
1
12
inch
head
some
minor
and
unconformed
lacing
in
the
glass
odor
was
slightly
skunky
but
that
is
not
unusual
for
the
style
malt
watery
sweetness
and
some
light
cooked
hops
were
present
taste
was
very
nice
quite
palatable
flavors
of
malt
grass
and
hops
were
present
as
was
a
slightly
bitter
character
finished
smooth
with
a
note
of
bitterness
and
some
dryness
this
could
be
a
easy
pick
for
a
session
oktoberfest
recommended
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
my
first
this
year
oktoberfest
i
guess
i
expected
much
more
malty
backbone
and
a
touch
of
caramel
toasted
sweetness
none
to
be
found
i
have
to
give
credit
to
the
cleanliness
of
this
beer
though
to
think
i
picked
this
over
a
sam
adams
ofest
oh
well
its
gotta
get
better
than
this
pours
light
yellowgolden
minor
head
and
lacing
nose
is
toasted
malt
not
the
most
exciting
style
for
me
this
one
has
less
malt
and
more
hops
then
expected
notes
of
spicy
honey
and
maybe
some
melon
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
quite
full
bodied
reasonably
enjoyable
sessioner
fairly
tasty
brew
this
is
pretty
good
bread
in
a
bottle
very
drinkable
not
what
i
expect
an
oktoberfest
to
be
like
more
helles
like
pours
a
clear
gold
medium
size
white
head
and
light
in
carbonation
nose
shows
yeast
predonimately
with
some
malt
flavor
is
yeasty
and
malty
both
lacks
the
malt
sweetness
of
an
oktoberfest
flavor
is
very
clean
but
not
what
i
expected
poured
a
light
straw
colour
there
was
a
medium
head
which
quickly
dissapated
the
beer
tasted
very
sweet
with
a
hop
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
at
least
its
cheap
poured
out
dark
gold
in
color
almost
lite
amber
aroma
of
malt
very
prevaulent
slight
toastiness
after
warming
some
toastiness
in
flavor
with
malt
being
the
dominant
distinctive
flavor
some
hop
bitterness
present
but
no
hop
flavor
noted
to
me
some
what
sweet
after
the
bitterness
subsides
body
medium
to
high
somewhat
creamy
moderate
carbonation
the
head
retention
being
the
two
finger
size
or
what
ever
the
standard
pour
is
is
low
but
it
keeps
a
skim
of
head
throughout
the
remainer
of
the
session
overall
it
is
an
one
or
two
beer
per
session
drinkable
german
amber
lager
recommend
off
the
tap
though
had
it
in
las
vegas
at
the
hofbrauhaus
there
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
someone
who
is
trying
to
get
their
hands
around
this
style
of
beer
if
you
want
something
by
hb
buy
their
helles
drinkability

this
really
wasnt
a
bad
bier
but
its
not
even
close
to
an
oktoberfest
poured
a
sparkling
gold
tinged
with
bronze
green
bottle
and
a
tad
skunky
in
the
aroma
a
little
of
the
same
in
the
initial
sip
then
it
faded
malt
was
promient
but
a
little
thin
fruity
flavors
apple
and
grape
were
noteworthy
seemed
to
be
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
not
at
all
bad
but
i
like
ofests
a
little
more
beefy
in
the
malt
its
a
very
nice
ofest
indeed
plain
and
simple
but
gets
the
job
done
makes
itself
very
easy
to
drink
bought
in
the
12
oz
bottle
only
says
hofbrau
oktoberfest
so
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
beer
nice
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
tiouch
of
honey
for
some
reason
pretty
average
in
appearance
for
a
marzen
a
deep
gold
with
a
small
white
head
nice
carbonation
and
lacing
flavour
is
a
caramelly
sweetness
followed
by
a
tangy
bitter
falavour
pretty
nice
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
a
nice
oktoberfest
to
drink
in
quantity
but
no
were
near
as
good
as
paulaner
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
this
beer
on
tap
at
mellow
mushroom
in
charlottesville
va
it
came
to
me
with
a
slight
creamy
head
with
dissipated
the
color
was
light
golden
the
smell
was
hops
and
malt
with
some
fruit
hints
taste
revealed
a
good
solid
malt
base
with
some
sweetness
and
fruity
notes
a
pleasant
bitterness
arises
in
the
center
of
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
left
a
good
coating
on
the
tongue
definitely
one
id
drink
again
if
i
have
the
chance
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
very
pale
for
a
marzen
the
aroma
was
very
skunky
not
much
more
the
flavor
has
some
of
the
same
skunkiness
and
caramel
the
caramel
is
pretty
strong
actually
slight
maltiness
i
think
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
better
might
have
been
skunked
but
this
is
a
poor
oktoberfestbier
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
nothing
the
nose
is
initially
skunky
like
a
heineken
the
nose
clears
to
be
a
bit
grassy
and
sweet
caramel
the
flavor
is
definately
grassy
with
a
caramel
tone
that
comes
through
late
the
feel
is
just
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
also
just
okay
probably
the
worst
ofest
ive
had
his
year
but
give
it
a
try
you
may
like
it
unfortunately
under
its
current
state
its
really
undrinkable
not
a
bad
brew
just
a
different
less
maltdriven
slightly
more
alcoholic
presentation
of
the
style
sorry
i
just
cant
get
into
this
first
of
all
this
beer
is
colored
like
a
pilsner
light
straw
yellow
good
head
but
i
am
unimpressed
by
this
unoktoberfest
color
smells
like
an
unpleasant
pilsner
at
first
mass
produced
yuck
at
this
point
i
am
very
disappointed
in
hofbrau
however
as
it
warms
there
is
some
citrus
and
even
a
little
spice
on
the
nose
cloves
so
i
am
pleased
that
there
is
something
interesting
going
on
tastes
better
than
it
smells
with
the
smooth
citrus
cloves
and
at
the
end
honey
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
smooth
easy
however
i
cant
get
into
this
as
an
oktoberfest
certainly
does
not
fit
the
style
drinkability
very
good
drinkability
i
had
a
few
an
ok
nice
little
helles
perhaps
an
oktoberfest
only
on
bizarro
world
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
color
is
a
little
lighter
than
a
typical
marzen
but
the
head
does
produce
considerable
lacing
the
aroma
has
an
expected
lightly
toasted
malt
aroma
but
also
has
a
distinct
hop
smell
the
beer
is
malty
light
and
very
smooth
this
is
extraordinarily
easy
to
drink
again
theres
more
hops
in
the
beer
than
ususal
for
the
style
but
they
dont
hurt
the
flavor
at
all
soft
and
very
drinkable
quite
tastey
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
nice
honey
slightly
sweet
beginning
that
moves
to
an
earthy
hop
finish
that
lingers
for
a
really
long
time
on
my
palate
nothing
too
sophisticated
or
complex
but
damn
is
that
drinkable
and
tasty
its
just
not
an
oktoberfest
beer
as
i
know
them
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
frothy
head
that
last
good
lacing
in
the
glass
sweet
huge
hoppy
floral
aromas
mild
bready
flavors
finishes
with
some
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
still
a
very
tasty
brew
pours
a
golden
straw
colorlighter
than
many
of
the
style
the
head
and
lace
are
moderate
at
best
aromas
are
all
about
the
maltsweet
and
extracted
in
the
mouth
the
beer
shows
good
crispness
and
a
medium
body
flavors
ring
true
to
the
style
again
with
a
good
dose
of
malt
worth
a
try
though
a
rather
restrained
version
of
the
classic
ng
almost
straw
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
coppery
tinge
the
head
starts
strong
but
goes
down
faster
than
a
french
prizefighter
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
floral
hop
sneaking
in
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
very
light
bitterness
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
but
very
drinkable
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
grassy
finish
nice
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
german
pilsner
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
with
all
of
the
other
options
out
there
for
this
style
but
this
was
enjoyable
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
ive
been
to
the
beer
hall
ive
danced
on
the
table
ive
sang
with
the
band
i
quaffed
dunkel
from
a
stone
stein
that
said
im
deeply
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
color
was
golden
not
amber
or
copper
but
golden
it
does
put
a
nice
head
on
it
but
no
lace
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
hops
not
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
with
some
malt
sweetness
coming
in
the
middle
of
the
experience
but
this
tastes
more
of
a
pilsner
than
an
oktoberfest
it
has
a
light
mouth
feel
and
is
generally
drinkable
but
it
is
not
an
oktoberfest
what
gives
i
love
their
lager
and
maibock
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
their
hefeweizen
but
this
is
way
off
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
the
smell
is
light
and
grassy
with
saaz
hops
present
the
taste
is
almost
pilslike
fairly
grassy
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
though
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
a
little
off
from
the
style
pale
golden
hue
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
down
the
halfliter
mug
quite
subdued
in
the
nose
with
some
mild
malt
and
somewhat
of
an
off
hop
flavor
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
a
restrained
bitterness
that
becomes
evident
on
the
prolonged
finish
fullbodied
marzen
lager
this
is
smooth
and
drinkable
decent
green
bottle
zum
wohl
had
this
at
two
locations
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
so
this
is
a
mix
of
the
two
reviews
golden
clear
color
aroma
is
like
smelling
a
candy
factory
with
some
floral
hop
notes
nice
frothy
white
head
taste
is
a
bit
bready
to
start
theres
some
sweetness
and
a
grassy
note
from
the
hops
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
one
i
needed
to
keep
drinking
either
pat
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
smooth
and
easydrinking
would
try
again
next
year
to
compare
notes
apparently
germans
have
picked
up
on
quality
brews
like
kokanee
not
to
trash
kokanee
as
its
often
my
choice
cheap
massivequantity
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
when
poured
from
its
green
bottle
it
looked
like
a
highly
carbonated
glass
of
apple
juice
the
head
was
big
white
and
vanished
quicker
than
trent
lott
at
an
naacp
meeting
the
smell
is
of
well
the
main
odor
is
that
scent
which
most
macro
drinkers
describe
as
beerlike
i
can
pick
out
some
corn
odor
in
there
thats
fine
when
eating
say
corn
on
the
cob
but
its
not
welcome
emanating
from
my
beverage
the
taste
is
similarly
macropilsnerish
very
thin
mouthfeel
its
drinkable
i
supose
if
one
is
not
bothered
by
a
need
for
flavor
drinkability
i
must
have
salted
away
about
5
or
6
of
these
during
the
game
so
that
speaks
for
itself
it
goes
down
easily
and
almost
too
quickly
even
after
several
the
flavor
is
still
right
there
hofbrau
oktoberfest
well
this
is
as
close
as
itll
come
to
reminding
me
of
my
trip
to
weisn
in
munich
not
a
deeply
colored
marzen
but
rather
a
crystal
clear
golden
beer
with
a
very
nice
and
creamy
head
and
mouthfeel
exceptional
smoothness
and
drinkability
fairly
nice
malts
nicely
balanced
with
almost
citrusy
hops
nice
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
come
to
find
out
a
fairly
dangerous
amount
of
alcohol
in
such
a
tasty
light
and
satisfying
beer
very
nice
a
crystalclear
golden
body
reveals
just
a
few
widespread
streams
of
steadily
rising
averagesized
bubbles
beneath
a
brightwhite
foamy
cap
the
head
drops
shortly
after
pouring
to
a
wide
creamy
collar
yet
it
still
leaves
some
impressive
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
enjoyable
but
not
impressive
for
the
style
with
just
some
light
grainy
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
falling
towards
light
with
a
gently
crisp
carbonation
the
flavor
offers
a
clean
grainy
malt
thats
nice
but
doesnt
offer
the
richness
of
vienna
andor
munich
malts
that
the
darker
versions
do
and
its
wellbalanced
with
a
firm
bitterness
and
spicy
character
alcohol
hops
or
both
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
which
is
odd
for
a
beer
of
just
6abv
it
finishes
dry
with
some
gently
lingering
malt
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
a
wellmade
refreshingly
dry
helles
oktoberfestbier
prost
pale
gold
or
dark
yellow
take
your
pick
as
this
is
not
impressive
looking
octoberfest
beer
a
decent
aroma
with
a
nice
malt
sense
despite
the
light
body
the
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
but
lacks
marzen
sweetness
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
unimpressive
this
beer
is
a
bit
disappointing
given
its
brewers
heritage
this
hofbräu
münchen
oktoberfest
poured
a
clear
goldenamber
color
with
longlasting
creamy
white
foam
the
smell
was
malty
with
elements
of
bread
and
biscuit
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
bread
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
slightly
sweet
though
less
sweet
than
many
other
oktoberfest
beers
and
with
some
floral
hop
notes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
and
with
some
sweetness
up
front
but
a
more
dry
finish
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
on
tap
and
was
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
do
so
pours
very
well
with
a
foamy
german
type
head
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
aspect
to
it
which
actually
calls
to
mind
a
wellmade
vienna
lager
guess
i
dont
have
my
expectations
for
the
okto
style
set
in
my
mind
in
other
words
this
is
a
pretty
okay
beer
the
texture
and
mouthfeel
come
across
like
a
standard
american
dark
beer
which
can
get
in
the
way
of
ones
enjoyment

5it
is
unbelievable
how
light
colored
this
oktoberfest
is
ive
had
close
to
20
ofests
this
year
and
nothing
comes
close
to
being
this
light
its
a
pale
but
by
no
means
fantastic
oktoberfest
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
oktobers
yet
it
is
still
a
good
beer
to
drink
it
goes
down
very
well
a
bit
malty
and
sweet
a
little
sweet
taste
more
of
the
caramelbiscuit
malts
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
there
a
perfectly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
oktoberfest
maybe
not
to
the
same
quality
as
a
true
german
rendition
but
nonetheless
one
id
not
hesitate
to
enjoy
again
omuch
better
than
i
was
expecting
especially
given
i
am
not
too
fond
of
the
style
2
985
eh
its
okay
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
vigorous
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
orange
copper
the
beer
smell
is
very
hoppy
for
an
oktoberfest
the
smell
has
orange
hop
notes
and
yeasty
bready
malt
notes
that
mix
well
with
the
hops
the
beer
taste
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
im
used
to
for
oktoberfests
the
beer
has
a
bready
and
malt
taste
that
is
topped
off
by
a
very
orange
and
tangy
hop
taste
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
carbonation
but
not
usually
as
thick
as
the
better
oktoberfests
overall
an
okay
but
there
are
better
ones
poured
a
decent
12
head
which
went
away
fast
and
left
minimal
lacing
first
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
honey
color
is
a
cloudy
orangetan
first
taste
is
crisp
with
a
well
balanced
blend
of
hops
yeast
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
flavor
overall
seems
well
balanced
and
maintains
its
crispness
throughout
about
half
way
through
there
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
aftertatste
but
it
is
desirable
and
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
overall
a
good
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
that
still
seems
to
remain
light
and
crisp
and
most
definitely
is
a
beer
to
drink
anytime
any
season
anywhere
not
too
much
going
on
here
good
beer
but
a
little
to
much
toward
the
sweet
caramel
flavor
o
this
is
a
quite
enjoyable
marzen
definitely
one
that
can
be
sessioned
the
slant
toward
a
bit
fuller
toasting
than
is
typical
for
the
style
really
keeps
the
sugars
at
bay
without
turning
the
beer
into
a
hopforward
brew
while
there
really
isnt
anything
particularly
distinctive
its
the
balance
and
toasting
that
make
this
the
kind
of
beer
thats
a
comfortable
goto
within
the
style
overall
nothing
to
complain
about
here
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
unfortunately
it
doesnt
taste
of
much
like
anything
your
american
adjunct
lager
chugging
buddies
might
really
enjoy
this
beer
overall
solid
offering
from
schlafly
very
tasty
beer
id
certainly
get
it
again
next
fall
o
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
malts
but
is
still
rather
drinkable
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
my
favorite
use
for
oktoberfest
brews
is
to
marinate
chicken
andor
brats
in
em
the
flavors
are
typical
of
the
genre
and
this
goes
down
easy
barley
bran
and
grainy
flavors
combine
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
tinges
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
biscuity
malt
all
lend
to
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
good
malty
lager
but
doesnt
really
hit
the
style
i
like
it
better
than
some
of
the
amber
lager
marzens
that
many
american
breweries
make
though
good
beer
for
watching
football
served
in
16
oz

glass
at
the
pourhouse
westmont
nj
12
oz
bottle
pours
amber
with
long
lasting
foamy
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
noble
hops
and
nutty
caramel
malt
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
sour
salty
caramel
and
herbal
hops
finish
is
long
and
salty
it
seams
to
me
they
were
trying
to
brew
gose
but
put
in
too
much
caramel
malt
overall
a
solid
representative
from
schlafly
in
terms
of
what
i
want
to
drink
in
an
ofest
this
is
right
on
the
money
but
in
terms
of
what
the
style
emphasizes
the
balance
is
off
to
my
palate
i
think
its
a
very
good
beer
i
think
its
just
a
good
oktoberfest
great
drinkability
a
good
beer
for
the
approaching
fall
season
pours
a
crystal
clear
amberorange
with
a
rich
dense
offwhite
head
aromas
of
soaked
grain
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
taste
begins
with
an
herbal
citrusy
flavor
followed
by
some
rich
bread
flavors
finishing
with
a
pine
forest
flavor
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
a
very
good
marzen
that
i
would
get
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
orange
slightly
cloudy
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
smells
of
oranges
lots
of
oranges
maybe
a
little
wheat
tastes
of
malt
with
a
little
hop
bite
but
pretty
bland
beer
is
carbonated
great
for
its
light
body
and
is
quite
drinkable
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
nothing
special
nothing
terrible
here
the
aroma
was
a
bit
off
to
me
cant
exactly
put
it
in
words
appearance
was
nice
darker
bronze
head
was
adequate
taste
was
rather
malty
sweet
with
a
mid
level
bitterness
on
end
of
swallow
i
dont
know
if
it
tasted
rather
metallic
or
hairspraylike
but
there
was
this
odd
flavor
at
the
end
of
each
drink
it
started
out
sweet
but
ended
with
this
tinny
taste
i
should
have
had
it
with
burgers
brats
or
wings
rather
than
by
itself
overall
lacking
in
malt
complexity
and
a
bit
too
bitter
for
the
style
drinkable
but
not
memorable
no
real
flaws
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
chunky
sticky
lacing
as
the
head
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thin
foam
aromas
are
malty
bready
caramel
toasted
grain
herbal
noble
hops
metallic
lager
yeast
tastes
are
nutty
grainy
bready
rye
perhaps
herbaly
hop
earthy
caramel
hint
of
tobacco
at
the
back
of
the
palate
its
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
nice
spicy
finish
while
finishing
semidry
overall
good
offering
of
the
style
glad
i
got
to
try
it
in
st
louis
drinkability
the
hair
spray
always
gets
me
perhaps
it
is
something
else
something
much
more
constructive
but
i
always
think
of
hair
spray
not
cool
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
oktoberfest
for
the
fall
season
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
spice
reminding
me
of
the
upcoming
fall
weather
taste
sweet
spice
and
everything
nice
love
the
malty
mouth
feel
and
slight
spicy
under
tones
of
a
crisp
fall
evening
very
enjoyable
overall
the
beer
poured
a
pleasant
orangish
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
laced
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruity
fragrances
on
the
edges
the
taste
was
straight
up
sweet
malt
like
you
expect
from
a
good
marzan
maybe
a
bit
of
peach
in
the
undertow
the
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
on
the
wet
side
as
youd
expect
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
that
you
could
sit
and
sip
on
all
day
overall
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
that
i
have
tried
o
a
nice
seasonal
from
schlafly
i
really
enjoy
the
fall
seasonals
so
i
look
forward
to
them
hitting
the
shelf
this
one
did
was
not
over
the
top
good
but
worth
trying
overall
i
really
didnt
get
this
beer
at
first
but
then
i
drank
another
and
it
started
to
make
sense
it
make
take
a
while
but
it
is
a
complex
brew
with
many
things
emerging
and
those
typical
warm
malty
caramel
notes
are
in
there
you
just
need
patience
interesting
take
but
probably
not
preferred
to
have
again
for
me
very
americanized
but
schlafly
has
managed
to
combine
fruitiness
with
rustic
earthiness
which
many
breweries
have
been
unable
to
pull
off
i
really
like
it
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
was
expecting
i
will
be
looking
to
pick
up
a
few
more
marzens
this
seasons
than
in
late
summers
past
d
very
drinkable
light
oktoberfest
o
made
the
mistake
of
trying
this
after
the
pumpkin
beer
an
excellent
example
of
the
marzen
style
but
i
just
want
more
pumpkin
o
just
a
soso
oktoberfest
nothing
really
special
or
rememberable
o
pretty
good
brew
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
pours
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
of
caramel
and
spices
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
like
caramel
with
some
malt
and
grain
followed
by
a
little
bitterness
a
pretty
good
balanced
beer
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
schlafly
glad
they
are
now
in
iowa
o
this
is
a
solid
oktoberfestbier
especially
when
compared
to
other
american
takes
on
this
style
i
really
like
the
unique
character
contributed
by
the
presumably
polish
hops
they
give
this
beer
an
extra
something
that
many
american
oktoberfestbiers
lack
that
being
said
there
really
isnt
much
separating
this
beer
from
other
beers
of
this
type
and
as
a
result
i
see
no
reason
to
seek
this
or
any
other
american
take
on
the
style
out
over
the
german
originals
12
oz
bottle
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
medium
amber
decent
but
rapidly
dissapating
head
aroma
is
fruit
and
biscuit
actually
very
pleasant
taste
is
subdued
spicy
hops
sweet
fruit
and
slight
caramel
medium
carbonation
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
not
much
stands
out
as
well
would
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
but
not
much
else
about
as
average
as
a
beer
can
be
this
oktoberfest
in
not
distinct
in
anyway
not
to
say
that
it
is
a
bad
beer
just
that
it
is
so
standard
and
in
line
with
other
traditional
american
brewed
oktobers
it
has
a
big
malty
nose
taste
and
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
not
particularly
drinkable
as
it
can
be
a
bit
filling
in
high
volume
i
doubt
i
will
buy
this
one
again
pours
a
copper
orange
white
creamy
head
that
dissipates
rather
quick
good
lacing
smell
of
citrusy
hops
some
malt
taste
is
malty
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
me
the
bitterness
overpowers
everything
else
good
carbonation
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
overall
it
is
like
the
brewers
were
going
for
a
cookie
cutter
oktoberfest
which
is
surprising
since
their
other
fall
offering
the
pumpkin
ale
is
so
interesting
and
tasty
i
am
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
and
wish
schlafly
would
have
given
it
more
herbal
notes
or
dialed
back
the
adjunct
wheat
flavor
in
there
o
started
out
great
but
blew
in
on
taste
not
bad
but
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
have
liked
a
lot
of
schlafly
stuff
that
i
have
tried
but
i
would
recommend
avoiding
this
poison
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
something
like
a
pbr
or
bud
i
would
be
drinking
pbr
and
bud
all
night
long
o
quite
enjoyable
easy
drinker
good
for
a
for
a
few
a
nice
seasonal
offering
o
im
glad
to
get
some
hops
from
a
marzen
for
once
but
they
kinda
muddied
up
the
rich
malt
flavors
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
offtap
in
alexandria
va
this
beer
was
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
retain
itself
particularly
well
and
left
very
little
lacing
as
a
result
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
light
esters
but
nothing
particularly
distinct
the
flavors
however
i
enjoyed
i
tasted
caramel
malt
some
toasted
malt
nuts
a
little
bit
of
biscuitlike
breads
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
provided
by
the
aboveaverage
hops
for
a
marzen
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
good
and
the
carbonation
low
a
simple
sessionable
example
of
the
style
biting
astringent
and
altogether
a
little
too
american
to
be
a
really
good
marzen
its
not
bad
certainly
but
not
what
i
look
for
the
in
style
oktoberfest
pours
out
hazy
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
rocky
head
on
a
good
draught
pour
as
the
head
slowly
subsides
theres
a
tremendous
amount
of
lacing
that
left
down
the
entirety
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
bier
well
it
reminds
me
of
fall
crammed
into
a
glass
but
since
thats
a
rather
subjective
statement
the
actual
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
tasted
and
grainy
malts
both
the
taste
and
the
drink
of
the
bier
is
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
malted
caramel
grains
and
bitterness
from
the
german
hop
varieties
overall
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
quintessential
autumnal
biers
for
saint
louis
locals
thanks
to
the
relatively
moderate

you
can
feel
comfortable
having
a
few
of
these
during
dinner
or
while
watching
a
game
i
poured
this
good
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
an
orange
looking
color
the
beer
poured
a
nice
big
head
the
beer
had
a
bready
smell
to
it
and
tasted
a
little
caramely
i
really
liked
the
beer
and
would
buy
again
i
noticed
thiugh
all
the
octoberfest
beers
coming
out
are
this
same
color
i
wonder
if
they
are
adding
food
coloring
another
average
offering
a
tasty
amberstyle
oktoberfest
that
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
but
a
nose
that
doesnt
really
match
the
flavor
falls
in
the
upper
half
of
ofests
but
that
nose
holds
it
back
a
little
bit
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
here
and
the
weird
soap
taste
in
the
finish
kind
of
confused
me
it
was
a
clean
glass
very
easy
drinking
and
would
be
happy
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
football
sunday
pours
a
clear
copper
body
with
a
small
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
in
order
of
intensity
are
earthy
first
toasty
second
and
tealike
third
the
flavor
is
far
less
toasty
than
many
oktoberfests
and
way
more
herbaceous
and
soillike
than
i
expected
but
in
a
way
thats
intriguing
if
autumnal
was
a
flavor
this
would
be
it
body
is
mediumfull
and
carbonated
in
a
way
that
showcases
its
unique
flavor
notes
very
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
amber
w
a
one
finger
off
white
head
great
lacing
and
almost
zero
carbonation
nose
is
toasted
malt
some
fruit
and
a
little
orange
taste
is
the
exact
same
profile
as
the
nose
not
great
but
pretty
good
very
light
and
fizzy
feel
on
the
brew
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
fantastic
you
can
find
better
oktoberfest
beers
the
aroma
was
light
bready
malts
with
a
hint
of
a
caramel
sweetness
light
touch
of
grape
like
fruit
in
their
providing
a
slight
nose
of
sour
rich
tones
working
their
way
in
the
flavor
though
quick
clean
hitting
and
crisp
this
was
a
definite
session
beer
to
say
the
least
nice
well
rounded
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
light
hops
toward
the
end
that
were
just
enough
to
provide
a
nice
touch
of
balance
the
schlafly
oktoberfest
is
a
good
festive
beer
the
appearance
is
a
clear
amber
with
decent
white
foam
that
laces
throughout
the
drink
the
smell
includes
sweet
malt
and
grain
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
sweet
goodness
typical
marzen
beer
great
for
the
cooler
fall
days
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
d
drinks
quite
nicely
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
great
oktoberfest
win
and
beer
full
of
flavor
these
guys
to
me
are
a
real
under
the
radar
simple
basic
and
good
brewery
very
underrated
they
make
some
solid
stuff
and
this
one
is
no
exception
goes
down
like
nothing
overall
impression
enjoying
again
in
the
same
week
in
bottle
this
time
very
average
brew
but
once
again
not
enough
character
for
a
oktoberfest
beer
easy
drinking
for
those
who
dont
give
a
shit
but
i
do
im
hoping
next
years
oktoberfest
brew
is
much
better
than
this
year
and
im
not
being
harsh
just
reviewing
another
beer
overall
a
good
oktoberfest
but
in
the
future
id
probably
pass
it
over
in
favor
of
better
examples
o
what
sets
this
one
apart
from
all
of
the
other
myriad
octoberfest
clones
you
might
ask
nothing
and
therein
lies
the
problem
medium
bodied
beer
was
very
fresh
and
drinkable
perfect
for
a
rainy
labor
day
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
available
in
tennessee
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
good
enough
to
have
another
and
seek
out
the
bottled
version
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
above
average
american
oktoberfest
it
is
malty
bready
and
satisfying
in
that
way
as
appropriate
for
the
style
enjoyed
my
first
octoberfest
of
the
season
out
of
the
bottle
and
in
a
pint
glass
this
oktoberfest
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
average
off
white
head
head
retention
was
average
and
there
was
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
ale
smelled
of
toasted
malt
and
fresh
baked
bread
the
taste
is
medium
in
body
a
malted
barley
base
a
little
sweet
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
an
average
representation
of
the
style
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
a
pretty
good
oktober
fest
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
home
run
but
solid
lots
of
barley
malts
some
caramel
notes
to
it
as
well
in
a
slightly
sweet
sort
of
way
a
light
hop
presence
is
found
but
only
as
a
balancing
factor
and
not
all
that
significantly
somewhat
cornlike
in
its
malts
as
well
which
is
a
little
offputting
and
unpleasant
it
was
bottled
8
days
ago
according
to
the
bottle
so
it
is
definitely
fresh
but
there
is
some
sort
of
taste
in
there
that
is
slightly
offputting
for
sure
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
though
as
any
oktoberfest
beer
should
be
just
lacking
slightly
in
the
flavor
department
a
little
bit
as
it
would
do
better
if
it
was
a
little
sweeter
this
was
my
first
oktoberfest
of
the
year
but
i
know
there
will
be
better
ones
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
a
little
grainy
on
the
finish
some
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
boiled
vegetables
bummer
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
brew
worth
a
try
falls
in
line
nicely
with
the
falloktoberfest
season
pretty
easily
drinkable
and
would
pair
well
with
a
cool
evening
verdict
quite
nice
drinkable
and
enjoyable
worth
trying
not
a
great
combination
or
balance
of
flavors
this
is
nothing
special
12
ounce
bottle
using
a
rudimentary
and
very
basic
beer
mug
for
this
one
somewhat
of
a
murky
cloudy
appearance
that
could
be
chill
haze
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
or
head
retention
caramel
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
sourdough
bread
underneath
light
carbonation
and
a
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
caramel
sweet
aroma
also
translates
over
to
the
finish
some
might
complain
that
the
bodys
a
little
thin
on
this
but
i
think
it
works
fine
in
the
parameters
of
the
beer
and
the
style
in
which
it
is
working
theres
also
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
to
be
found
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
though
the
huge
caramel
finish
overpowers
that
relatively
quickly
lemony
citrus
hops
also
help
to
cut
the
sweetness
of
the
finish
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
profile
which
is
good
because
its
very
decent
and
enjoyable
that
said
its
not
spectacular
theres
not
a
lot
here
thats
going
to
bring
you
back
to
the
beer
or
anything
particularly
memorable
about
it
good
body
and
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
for
the
season
pretty
good
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
an
oktoberfest
the
color
and
taste
are
spot
on
and
very
tasty
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
to
drink
while
its
not
the
most
overwhelmingly
good
beer
for
this
time
of
year
this
is
a
highly
serviceable
and
sessionable
fest
d
a
decent
if
slightly
underwhelming
marzen
a
bit
more
flavor
intensity
and
one
could
pair
this
with
a
variety
of
foods
has
a
great
drinkability
as
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
and
light
but
the
bite
at
the
end
keeps
it
from
being
a
session
beer
they
just
started
making
it
and
its
quite
fresh
btw
bottled
on
862010
i
think
i
got
one
of
the
first
sixers
sold
in
my
area
its
just
a
bit
odd
for
a
marzen
and
not
all
that
similar
to
what
i
had
in
the
taproom
drinkability
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
prefer
that
over
the
bottle
but
still
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
style
this
will
be
one
of
my
regular
fall
beers
easy
to
drink
but
it
gets
a
tad
sweet
honeyish
after
just
one
on
the
palate
its
clean
and
crisp
with
slightly
dry
finish
id
say
schlafly
did
great
on
this
interpretation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
if
i
were
at
oktoberfest
in
munich
and
this
was
served
to
me
i
wouldnt
know
the
difference
between
this
and
any
other
without
a
side
by
side
comparison
softly
carbonated
lightmedium
body
pours
a
very
lively
copperamber
with
a
two
finger
off
white
very
nice
smells
of
sweet
yeast
bread
grass
cider
and
small
malt
tastes
of
light
malt
and
toast
with
a
very
grainy
aftertaste
light
body
with
good
carbonation
the
grainy
aftertaste
makes
it
very
difficult
to
enjoy
this
lighter
beer
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
fresh
to
compare
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
i
recommend
this
for
those
who
enjoy
a
light
bodied
brew
that
has
a
distinct
malt
grain
profile
a
one
and
done
for
me
d
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
sweetness
in
the
finish
drop
the
drinkability
on
this
one
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
one
or
two
lots
of
flavor
on
this
americanized
version
of
an
oktoberfest
toasty
and
nutty
malts
are
just
as
prevalent
as
the
typical
sweet
caramel
touch
of
fruitiness
and
the
finish
has
some
definite
hoppy
bitterness
body
is
nice
and
creamy
but
seems
a
touch
overcarbonated
i
like
it
well
enough
but
it
is
not
as
thirst
quenching
and
clean
as
many
of
the
better
german
versions
of
the
style
not
as
sessionable
still
not
a
bad
offering
and
i
would
gladly
try
this
again
perhaps
on
tap
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
ofest
to
drink
for
a
long
time
the
feel
is
not
as
thick
as
some
other
ofests
but
not
too
thin
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
something
to
look
forward
too
when
fall
comes
around
and
this
is
an
underrated
american
interpretation
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
chewy
slick
this
is
a
tasty
guy
d
definately
a
good
session
beer
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
not
too
heavy
with
lots
of
flavor
a
real
nice
brew
split
a
mixed
12
pack
from
a
hy
vee
in
columbia
mo
poured
a
tall
offwhite
head
with
a
toasted
caramel
malt
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
little
tangy
lager
kick
in
the
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
summits
ofest
the
malts
are
mild
at
first
but
a
little
orange
peel
hop
burnt
caramel
a
pleasantly
grainy
crust
this
beer
is
more
aggressive
than
your
usual
oktoberfest
but
you
could
consider
this
a
tasty
american
interpretation
pours
a
clear

similar
to
the

the

overall
really
good
tasting
not
too
sweet

smooth
as
can
be
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin

drinkability
is
high
definitely
a
session

i
have
enjoyed
every
product
from
this
brewery
and
this
is
no
exception
drinks
very
easy
a
great
stab
at
the
style
will
be
getting
some
of
this
every
fall
drinkability
is
so
so
with
the
heavier
body
the
temp
needs
to
drop
some
more
before
i
could
put
many
away
a
good
oktoberfest
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
it
german
counterparts
or
sam
adams
oktoberfest
for
that
matter
i
wished
it
would
have
been
just
a
little
sweeter
it
is
a
bronze
colored
beer
it
has
a
tan
head
with
a
lot
of
over
the
body
that
disappears
quickly
to
form
a
spread
out
and
thin
lace
it
has
a
sweet
and
malty
taste
at
first
it
is
a
little
more
mild
on
the
hops
than
most
marzens
i
mainly
tasted
what
little
bit
of
hops
that
i
did
taste
in
the
aftertaste
i
do
like
the
way
it
taste
though
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
good

summer
to
winter

pours
a

overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
solid
brew
but
then
pretty
much
everything
ive
tried
from
schlafly
have
been
good
beers
too
bad
i
cant
buy
them
in
ohio
if
they
were
available
here
id
pick
up
their
products
more
often
recommended
this
isnt
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
its
a
damn
good
one
its
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
i
was
happy
i
did
it
poured
with
a
nice
quickly
evaporating
head
and
slight

nice
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
seasonal
spices
smooth
to
drink
with
only
a
hint
of
bitter
in
the
slightly
sweet
finish
cant
wait
to
buy
a
case
as
good
a
beer
as
ive
had
in
a
while
like
most
of
schlaflys
beers
i
have
this
is
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
sweet
and
satisfying
in
short
i
thought
this
was
a
very
likable
brew
from
schlafly
a
brewery
that
seems
to
me
to
be
getting
better
each
year
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
great
american
oktoberfest
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
not
tried
many
others
of
this
style
so
i
dont
know
how
this
stacks
up
against
the
rest
it
is
very
malty
and
makes
for
a
great
companion
when
watching
football
on
the
weekend
poured
12
oz

golden
color
with
1
finger
white
head
that
diminishes
to
none
with
little
to
no

slight
malty
aroma
lightly
sweet
malty
flavor
that
lasts
through
to
finish
slightly
more
carbonated
than
its
german
relatives
very
drinkable
a
good
american
version
of
this
style
not
bad
for
a
beer
that
was
selected
because
it
was
the
best
available
at
a
memphis
tn
walmart
top
notch
oktoberfest
and
far
superior
to
most
other
examples
of
the
style
smooth
and
creamy
easy
on
the
palate
schalfly
has
brewed
a
gem
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
schlafly
a
fine
brewery
whose
wares
have
at
times
been
hitandmiss
with
me
schlafly
oktoberfest
is
unquestionably
a
hit
very
well
done
this
is
an
ok
ofest
not
on
the
scale
of
a
paulaner
but
i
will
finish
this
sixer
easily
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
has
a
very
sweet
bready
smell
with
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
also
a
nice
steady
stream
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
is
also
noted
taste
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
with
a
hopps
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
schlafly
oktoberfest
is
a
pretty
good
version
that
nevertheless
failed
to
knock
me
off
my
feet
ill
stick
with
millstream
oktoberfest
however
if
you
live
in
the
st
louis
area
you
could
do
a
whole
lot
worse
you
could
also
do
a
whole
lot
better
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
feel
the
need
to
come
back
to
sample
at
the
lambert
st
louis
airport
location
this
beer
is
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
that
has
a
short
life
span
top
ring
of
lace

spots
underneath
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
pine
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
sweet
bready
malt
character
touches
of
piney
hops
and
spice
here
and
there
as
well
the
finish
remains
sweet
with
a
short
toasted
malt
aftertaste
another
average
beer
from
schlafly
but
again
a
welcome
sight
while
at
the
airport
waiting
for
a
plane
drinkability
despite
a
rather
distracting
smell
this
is
a
great
octoberfest
another
one
for
the
halloween
party
tonight
d
despite
the
mouth
feel
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
had
more
than
a
few
and
they
got
better
as
the
night
waned
d
outstandingly
drinkable
as
are
all
good
ofests
i
drank
two
big
ass
22
oz
glasses
of
this
wonderful
stuff
d
ez
to
quaff
im
fan
of
marzenofest
biers
and
this
is
a
good
one
pours
a
rich
golden
amber
color
with
a
twofinger
head
of
just
offwhite
sheets
of
lacing
line
the
mug
active
carbonation
bubbles
rush
to
the
surface
making
this
beer
appear
quite
lively
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
fresh
bread
and
sweet
caramel
corn
the
palate
is
thankfully
not
over
sweet
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
is
dominent
but
the
somewhat
yeasty
bready
character
is
assertive
very
mild
hop
balance
but
enough
to
temper
the
sweetness
sufficiently
mouthfeel
is
medium
witha
nice
carbonation
bite
finish
is
smooth
enough
and
only
somewhat
dry
maybe
not
my
very
favorite
oktoberfest
for
the
year
but
it
is
among
the
better
examples
ive
had
for
2007
id
say
maybe
only
millstream
is
better
over
all
of
the
45
ofests
ive
tried
so
far
another
very
solid
brew
from
schlafly
id
prefer
a
little
more
heartiness
to
my
oktoberfest
but
this
one
didnt
disappoint
nutty
vague
apple
esters
coarse
barley
some
vague
lagery
aroma
maybe
noble
hops
very
vague
and
average
even
when
relatively
fresh
just
okay
thanks
to
paul
for
the
fresh
bottle
pours
a
very
light
amber
color
with
minimal
head
smells
pretty
good
has
a
nice
maltiness
to
it
but
hardly
any
hop
character
tastes
good
again
has
a
solid
maltiness
to
it
slightly
watery
but
nothing
awful
good
all
around

a
small
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
broken
coating
over

of

this
is
a
very
clear
beer
and
it
has
a
moderate
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroms
brings
some
sweet
bready
notes
with
a
touch
of
caramel
as
well
under
the
sweetness
is
a
light
toastyness
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
coming
together
as
well
as
it
could
to
me
the
sweetness
doesnt
work
for
me
in
this
one
tasting
it
there
is
a
definite
bready
quality
that
dominates
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
moving
to
a
more
mild
toastyness
and
a
little
grainyness
to
boot
it
finishes
with
a
little
grassyness
from
noble
hoping
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
of
small
bubbles
it
is
a
bit
drying
on
the
finish
which
i
find
detracting
to
the
experience
this
one
is
okay
the
sweetness
just
isnt
working
for
me
and
the
drying
quality
is
not
pleasing
i
would
go
with
another
ofest
before
i
had
this
one
again
the
drink
ability
is
good
not
great
but
a
fine
and
mainstream
example
of
the
style
prosit
mk
thanks
beerhandy
for
the
opportunity
pretty
good
american
rendition
of
the
style
somewhere
between
a
copper
and
orange
hue
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
bready
caramel
malt
aroma
with
light
grain
and
earthy
hops
tastes
similarlly
with
emphasis
on
the
caramel
malts
and
german
hops
medium
fullness
and
richness
in
the
body
that
thins
toward
the
end
leaves
with
a
mild
grainy
flavor
and
texture
allowing
the
hop
bitterness
to
linger
not
bad
but
cannot
compete
with
good
german
ofests
not
a
bad
beer
here
though
will
still
find
myself
reaching
for
something
else
other
than
an
oktoberfest
more
often
than
not
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
probably
wont
have
another
poured

would
make

beer
lacking
in
complexity

overall
characteristics
a
good
solid
oktoberfest
easily
the
lightest
one
ive
sampled
this
season
could
use
some
more
maltiness
in
my
opinion
but
still
a
great
easy
to
drink
beer
nonetheless
suggest
trying
great
beginner
introduction
to
oktoberfest
beers
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
just
somewhat
uninteresting
thanks
to
vancer
for
the
opportunity
d
it
is
a
decent
lager
but
it
didnt
quite
meet
my
expectations

taste
is

not
overly
syrupy
more
of
a
honey

flavor
as
i
drink
aftertaste
is
lightly
sweet
a
very
satisfying
brew
thanks
hop
beer
doesnt
get
much
fresher
than
this
as
it
was
consumed
a
mere
4
days
after
bottling
props
to
schlafly

getting
it
in
stores

quickly
definitely
worth

pretty
good
brew
from
the
schlafly
folks
i
could
and
probably
will
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
this
season
malts
and
spices
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
also
noted
nice
hints
of
a
nutty
cinnamon
very
crisp
and
dry
a
real
pleasurable
brew
and
made
for
a
nice
short
session
grabbed
some
bottled
oks
for
the
weekend
looking
forward
to
them
football
saturday
nite
overall
a
good
beer
but
one
that
i
keep
waiting
for
the
other
shoe
to
drop
and
it
never
does
its
almost
like
having
half
a
beer
and
hoping
the
other
half
with
get
there
sometime
certainly
worth
trying
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
taste
starts
of
a
bit
spicy
and
floral
but
that
quickly
fades
into
the
breadycaramel
malt
flavors
i
really
liked
the
spiciness
that
this
started
with
but
it
didnt
stick
around
long
enough
for
me
and
the
malts
were
a
little
to
muted
as
well
mouthfeel
was
pretty
much
standard
for
the
style
light
to
medium
bodied
a
decent
copper
leaning
red
color
with
a
good
white
head
that
fades
down
to
clumps
of
head
smells
a
touch
citric
and
the
malt
is
also
a
little
muted
but
there
is
breadyness
to
it
as
well
this
has
the
usual
clean
lager
yeast
taste
but
the
malt
flavor
seems
a
little
confused
for
a
marzen
not
assertive
enough
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
could
be
an
ok
session
beer
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
finsh
when
all
is
said
it
done
i
like
this
beer
i
found
it
plenty
drinkable
i
will
happily
drink
the
sixpack
i
purchased
in
kansas
city
mo
this
beer
will
be
one
of
my
last
ofest
this
year
i
am
pleased
to
end
on
a
happy
note
i
say
try
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
it
is
very
nice
deep
copper
to
orange
color
clear
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
nice

aroma
is

the
flavor
has
a
deep
toffee
flavor
more
fig
and
date
almost
a
light
roast
smooth
rich
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
this
beer
needs
a
little
work
in
speaking
with
a
few
other
bas
it
seems
to
be
a
consistent
problem
with
the
base
malt
and
i
agree
this
beer
could
be
great
with
a
little
tweaking

i
enjoyed
this
at
the
bottleworks
this
beer
matches
its
season
very
nicely
roasty
malt
and
hopped
well
the
color
was
a
warm
orange
and
the
head
was
small
this
sample
was
carbonated
well
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
it
was
one
of
the
better
ones
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
was
way
too
bitter
for
my
taste
it
had
a
large
sized
creamy
offwhite
head
that
contained
finelarge
sized
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
nose
was
lightly
malty
lightly
hoppy
and
sweet
the
flavor
was

left

the

note
the
flavor
comes
through
with

the
finish
on
this
little
beauty
is
quite
dry
in
the
end
a
really
nice
built
taste
the
feel
is
a
bit
full
but
quite
smooth
i
believe
that
this
is
a
long
session
beer
long
live
october
cheers
to

for
the

up

very
rich
borderline
full
bodied
a
tinge
of
spiciness
and
hops

be
noted
slight
sticky
and
sugary
very
well
rounded
and
balanced
excellent
brew
clear

has
a
light
flowery
and
malty
caremel
aromas
sweet
balanced
malts
and
clean
tasting
medium

nice
rounded
malty
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
with
a
maibock
feel
some
great
stuff
and
strong
for
the
style
this
is
my
kind
of
octoberfest
rich
and
malty
initial
smell
on
the
nose
is
toasty
but
that
gives
way
to
a
wonderful
caramel
aroma
body
is
about
perfect
rich
and
pretty
thick
and
firm
for
this
style
taste
is
like
i
expected
from
the
nose
big
maltiness
caramel
sweet
malt
and
then
the
surprise
to
it
all
is
a
tich
of
spiciness
from
some
late
entering
hops
that
keeps
things
balanced
nicely
an
excellent
octoberfest
one
of
the
top
5
i
had
this
year
pours

deep
slightly
hazy

a
nice
tan

and
some

strong
aroma
of
toasty
sweet
caramel
malts
a
full
mouthfeel
precedes
the
flavor
of
sticky
sweet
caramel
maltiness
definite
perceivable
alcohol
undertones
hopping
detected
but
for
balance
only
a
pretty
solid
and
beefy
ofest
my
first
schlafly
brew
thanks
to
my
brother
for
bringing
this
up
from
st
louis
over
the
thanksgiving
holiday
weekend
funny
thing
about
it
is
schell
brewery
in
new
ulm
mn
contract
brews
the
bottled
version
so
my
six
different
brews
that
i
received
from
my
brother
have
traveled
a
long
ways
for
my
drinking
and
reviewing
pleasure
i
am
beginning
to
question
my
desire
to
taste
oktoberfest
style
microbrews
this
light
orange
color
brew
with
a
light
white
lace
has
a
light
biscuit
aroma
but
the
mellowness
ends
there
the
malt
flavor
is
sharply
sweet
and
the
boldness
of
the
bitter
creates
a
beer
that
could
be
great
with
an
extended
stay
in
a
cellar
but
until
it
mellows
quite
a
bit
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
it
cheers
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
on
my
list
to
drink
again
a
bit
to
sweet
and
not
quite
as
balanced
as
id
prefer
o
very
tasty
hop
profile
is
great
the
malt
character
is
a
great
balance
of
toasty
and
sweet
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
medium
body
and
carbonation
glass
dimpled
mug
excellent
oktoberfest
marzen
style
beer
been
to
the
oktoberfest
in
munich
many
times
and
this
beer
is
as
good
or
better
than
any
other
beers
that
ive
tasted
of
this
style
i
poured
three
12
oz
bottles
into
a
1
liter
glass
mug
a
nice
two
inch
head
and
reddish
color
the
aroma
was
perfect
it
brought
me
back
to
munich
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
be
had
year
round
ein
prosit
overall
im
sure
there
are
better
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
but
id
get
this
again
its
exactly
what
its
trying
to
be
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
best
fest
ive
had
in
memory
off
of
tap
in
green
lake
wi
fantastic
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
very
little
that
stands
out
new
glarus
makes
a
lot
of
good
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
o
very
refreshing
malt
forward
beer
that
is
very
clean
tasting
and
finishing
tastes
like
the
season
45
this
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
modestly
carbonated
a
crushable
brew
by
marzen
standards
i
couldwould
drink
a
bunch
of
this
if
it
was
accessible
to
me
in
season
brilliant
amber
color
with
a
frothy
cream
head
that
slowly
dissipates
aroma
is
dominated
by
floral
and
earthy
noble
hops
which
fade
to
a
toasted
bready
malt
character
flavor
reveals
specialty
malt
fruitiness
initially
which
is
countered
by
bready
nutty
malt
in
the
lightly
dry
finish
very
sessionable
beer
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
more
than
id
prefer
in
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
light
red
amber
with
a
good
one
finger
white
head
smells
of
berries
and
nice
sweet
caramelized
grain
tastes
of
fruit
berries
and
nice
sweet
grain
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
finishes
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
best
oktoberfest
goin
imo
blessed
to
live
in
wi
also
blessed
that
new
glarus
beers
hold
up
a
lot
better
then
most
with
a
few
months
on
um
prost
my
friends
orange
with
a
tint
of
gold
in
color
head
dissipated
very
quickly
creamy
colored
collar
persists
smell
is
mostly
tangy
orange
with
some
faint
leather
notes
taste
is
of
citrus
and
spice
think
coriander
ginger
and
clove
mouthfeel
is
probably
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
light
yet
full
despite
the
low
amount
of
head
the
carbonation
is
enjoyable
im
enjoying
new
glarus
more
and
more
with
every
brew
i
have
from
them
however
this
is
the
first
one
that
hasnt
wowed
me
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
marzen
good
biscuity
malt
notes
with
some
nice
undertones
c
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
märzens
1st
time
i
had
this
beer
was
walking
around
notre
dame
campus
sipping
beer
out
of
a
jjs
to
go
cup
before
the
temple
game
still
good
in
an
actual
glass
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
wisconsin
brewing
company
new
glarus
knows
what
there
doing
when
it
come
to
a
oktoberfest
not
as
heavy
as
other
oktoberfest
but
has
amazing
flavor
and
a
great
aroma
a
beer
id
recommend
to
any
oktoberfest
beer
drinker
but
for
those
out
of
state
people
i
feel
bad
for
you
that
you
cant
experience
this
beer
or
any
other
new
glarus
beer
o
a
solid
take
on
the
style
by
an
american
brewery
definitely
one
for
the
malt
lovers
out
there
id
highly
recommend
this
if
youre
into
the
style
picked
this
up
going
to
the
bristol
renaissance
fair
i
wanted
to
compare
this
oktoberfest
style
beer
with
two
brothers
atom
smasher
oktoberfest
style
beer
i
absolutely
love
anything
that
new
glarus
produces
but
in
this
case
two
brothers
atom
smasher
takes
the
win
staghorn
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
barley
flavour
nice
hopp
flavour
as
as
you
open
your
mouth
after
you
finish
swallowing
the
amber
colored
brew
well
rounded
mellow
smooth
taste
id
deffinately
grab
another
6er
if
im
up
in
wisconsin
within
the
next
month
or
so
or
even
next
years
oktoberfest
the
feel
on
this
is
very
nice
clean
refreshing
in
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
well
carbonated
slightly
dry
finish
that
is
very
heavy
on
the
malts
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfeststyle
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
actually
nice
work
on
this
lager
dan
this
tastes
like
autumn
it
has
that
perfect
blend
of
spicy
hop
and
malt
just
excellent
i
thought
i
remembered
not
liking
this
one
so
id
been
avoiding
purchasing
it
for
awhile
plus
having
2
years
without
being
near
wisconsin
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
wonderful
nice
rep
for
the
style
color
was
a
nice
goldenred
the
head
presented
itself
nicely
about
a
half
of
inch
but
then
dissipated
quickly
im
usually
looking
for
a
little
more
malty
finish
in
an
oktoberfest
it
was
briefly
there
but
not
as
pronounced
as
i
look
for
in
this
style
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
an
outstanding
brewery
if
you
get
a
chance
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
or
better
yet
if
you
get
a
chance
to
have
this
on
tap
i
wouldnt
pass
it
by
itll
be
well
worth
the
cost
o
a
nicely
balanced
marzen
not
overly
sweet
or
hoppy
like
many
american
versions
o
i
had
the
bar
set
pretty
high
on
this
one
and
new
glarus
cleared
it
by
a
country
mile
not
sure
how
much
a
sixer
of
this
cost
in
wisconsin
but
i
imagine
its
pretty
much
the
same
as
id
grab
a
quality
ofest
around
here
i
think
ill
move
to
cheeseland
during
the
fall
overall
a
great
seasonal
from
this
brewery
very
flavorful
and
quite
fulfilling
pours
light
copper
see
through
with
foamy
white
head
light
malty
smell
light
malty
flavor
hop
swirled
in
modestly
sweet
touch
of
spiciness
on
the
tongue
real
easy
drinker
with
loads
of
malty
goodness
good
ofest
celebrator
clean
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
orange
amber
color
the
head
on
the
beer
was
very
nice
it
settles
but
as
a
good
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
with
a
pleasent
malt
aroma
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
grassy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
i
found
this
to
be
really
good
came
close
to
some
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
that
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
most
this
is
a
very
sessoinable
octoberfest
beer
that
is
gone
too
fast
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
drinkability
i
was
a
little
disappointed
initially
but
the
beer
turned
into
something
special
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
best
märzens
i
have
tried
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
slightly
fizzy
but
gradually
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
is
not
dry
and
there
is
some
residual
sweetness
across
the
palate
this
generally
comes
across
as
correct
for
the
style
and
this
particular
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
sweet
and
bready
but
not
as
rounded
as
my
favorite
marzens
the
sharp
grassy
end
grows
on
you
but
it
the
balancing
effect
with
the
smoother
malty
start
isnt
fully
to
my
liking
i
guess
im
just
particular
with
this
style
still
well
brewed
and
they
hit
what
they
were
going
for
just
so
far
as
marzens
go
id
prefer
they
had
gone
for
something
a
little
different
again
this
isnt
to
say
this
is
badbecause
its
actually
pretty
goodits
just
not
the
top
tier
oktoberfest
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
o
from
the
maltiness
to
its
earthy
hops
new
glarus
staghorn
octoberfest
embodies
much
of
what
makes
a
classic
german
oktoberfest
great
but
seems
to
miss
the
mark
on
mass
consumption
drinkability
a
bit
while
i
truly
enjoy
the
balance
and
bolder
hoppiness
this
beer
offers
i
cant
say
that
id
want
it
served
to
me
in
a
liter
stein
ill
stick
to
the
yearly
6pack
one
delicious
staghorn
at
a
time
o
thanks
to
skye
for
bringing
this
from
madison
a
great
way
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
autumn
oi
tend
to
sway
towards
a
more
malty
sweet
version
of
this
style
however
this
beer
is
well
made
and
id
have
no
problem
knocking
these
back
on
a
crisp
fall
day
just
a
bit
boring
with
a
weak
malt
backbone
the
beer
pours
a
a
dark
amber
almost
copper
color
with
a
big
cap
of
creamy
foam
that
stayed
around
throughout
a
rich
malty
aroma
fills
the
nose
the
medium
bodied
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
big
dose
of
grain
continues
on
the
palate
its
not
too
sweet
a
little
bready
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
it
exclaims
the
bounty
of
a
fall
harvest
keeping
the
grain
center
stage
the
finish
has
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
is
a
clean
brew
with
a
nice
fall
flavor
the
folks
at
new
glarus
followed
their
own
path
when
developing
this
oktoberfest
and
it
stands
above
many
other
fall
seasonals
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
lovely
head
the
smell
is
sweetly
complex
with
overtones
of
clove
but
the
flavor
is
what
makes
this
one
so
great
its
a
richly
complex
beer
smooth
but
not
overwhelming
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
o
a
very
clean
easy
drinking
version
of
the
style
many
of
the
typical
oktoberfest
beers
tend
to
be
far
to
malty
for
my
likings
but
this
one
is
fairly
nice
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
very
drinkable
very
tasty
it
has
just
enough
of
everything
and
keeps
with
the
style
wont
bore
but
doesnt
step
out
the
bounds
i
really
like
it
and
will
continue
to
be
excited
for
it
every
fall
overall
i
really
do
not
like
this
beer
strange
considering
i
really
enjoy
almost
everything
else
from
new
glarus
there
are
many
other
oktoberfest
style
brews
i
prefer
to
staghorn
including
sam
adams
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
in
the
future
o
this
beer
was
good
and
definitely
drinkable
however
the
low
carbonation
made
it
seem
very
off
the
scent
was
rather
poor
although
it
smelled
alright
kind
of
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
new
glarus
first
of
their
beers
i
have
ever
tried
and
felt
this
way
about
hoping
this
bottle
was
defective
but
im
not
so
sure
may
try
again
at
some
point
if
i
get
the
chance
but
this
was
really
a
rather
bland
marzen
pours
a
clear
deep
ambercopper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
amber
and
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
some
earthy
hops
lingering
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
cutting
through
the
finish
medium
body
very
nice
the
beer
is
light
golden
colored
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
fruity
light
malt
smooth
feel
nice
flavor
with
a
lingering
lager
malt
and
fruity
aftertaste
a
touch
of
dryness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
this
one
goes
down
easily
a
solid
example
of
the
style
great
aroma
the
rest
disappoints
onot
bad
but
maybe
not
my
favorite
from
new
glarus
do
this
beer
is
a
genuine
pacesetter
among
americanbrewed
amber
lagers
there
may
be
no
better
choice
to
show
off
the
potential
of
new
glarus
to
brew
a
traditional
and
delicious
germanstyle
beer
it
is
deliciously
malty
and
very
palatefriendlytruly
compelling
o
i
realize
im
late
in
the
season
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
out
there
had
it
before
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
this
is
a
top
tier
lager
a
very
clean
and
precise
oktoberfest
that
compares
well
with
any
usbrewed
versions
of
the
style
overall
a
tasty
and
clean
beer
im
somewhat
offput
by
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
quickly
disappears
so
as
not
to
detract
from
the
total
experience
of
the
beer
would
drink
again
d
this
is
a
really
solid
marzen
style
brew
pretty
straightforward
but
this
style
usually
isnt
the
deepest
in
flavors
but
what
is
there
is
really
good
and
flavorful
definitely
enjoyed
this
offering
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
its
hard
to
distinguish
this
as
anything
other
than
a
slightly
spicer
more
expensive
miller
lite
again
i
do
not
like
the
style
but
even
for
a
marzen
this
one
fell
flat
for
me
it
does
make
a
great
brat
marinade
however
overall
i
like
a
lot
of
the
beers
from
new
glarus
but
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
way
too
sweet
for
a
marzen
oktoberfest
style
and
way
too
thin
and
watery
there
are
too
many
good
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
to
have
any
reason
to
seek
this
one
out
again
o
of
all
of
the
octoberfestmarzen
style
brews
i
have
tried
this
is
the
most
memorable
it
has
the
nice
lager
flavors
that
go
along
with
the
style
but
also
has
its
own
unique
spin
well
done
new
glarus
i
was
able
to
try
staghorn
last
night
at
an
oktoberfest
party
the
beer
poured
clear
amber
orange
with
a
sudsy
off
white
head
that
settles
pretty
quickly
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
the
scent
for
the
most
part
was
typical
grain
and
slight
alcohol
the
taste
was
dissapointing
to
me
the
beer
was
slightly
sweet
and
a
mild
spicy
hop
character
that
balances
well
in
the
finish
theres
a
vague
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
with
warmth
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
body
was
fine
i
dont
think
i
can
have
more
than
one
though
overall
it
is
ok
worth
a
try
sure
more
than
that
eh
o
refreshingpleasant
octoberfest
that
i
could
drink
year
around
very
good
bordering
on
great
beer
new
glarus
never
disappoints
overall
my
favorite
octoberfest
beer
i
love
this
beer
dan
carey
does
a
fantastic
job
with
this
style
it
falls
and
this
beer
is
the
beer
i
love
during
this
season
normally
i
dont
want
another
marzen
but
i
would
make
an
exception
for
this
unfortunately
this
is
the
only
one
left
from
my
wisconsin
trip
i
found
these
old
wisconsin
microbreweries
to
be
much
better
than
i
had
given
them
credit
for
they
make
a
lot
of
micromiller
but
they
also
make
bolder
styles
ohuge
disappointment
okay
to
sell
this
just
dont
call
it
an
octoberfest
o
meh
just
ok
it
would
be
a
good
beer
if
your
planning
on
drinking
a
6
pack
or
tailgating
but
just
to
plain
for
me
overall
this
is
a
good
german
style
marzen
i
guess
i
tend
to
prefer
the
more
americanized
versions
of
them
which
are
heavier
on
the
malt
but
this
is
still
a
good
one
i
love
new
glarus
o
this
is
decent
beer
but
its
not
outstanding
there
are
many
other
octoberfest
beers
that
id
prefer
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
another
decent
offering
from
the
new
glarus
crew
who
dont
seem
to
make
anything
bad
if
you
like
your
oktoiberfests
on
the
sweet
side
this
may
not
be
the
one
for
you
but
the
herbs
and
spices
make
it
a
little
unique
and
worth
a
try
the
6
25
abv
is
not
even
noticeable
o
a
nice
beer
to
drink
very
traditional
the
noble
hops
are
there
but
i
think
my
ofest
preference
is
the
americanized
version
i
crave
more
caramel
from
mine
such
as
found
in
sam
adams
or
great
lakes
this
is
more
like
the
imports
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
like
a
maltier
beer
for
this
style
the
taste
starts
with
a
very
bready
malt
front
loads
of
grain
some
caramel
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
to
provide
balance
the
mouth
is
light
and
smooth
i
followed
up
a
paulaner
oktoberfest
with
this
version
from
new
glarus
the
munich
brew
is
less
flavorful
but
more
subtle
and
maybe
a
little
better
balanced
the
fact
that
the
paulaner
brewery
is
6000
miles
away
and
the
new
glarus
brewery
is
60
miles
away
may
have
a
bearing
on
the
contrast
though
staghorn
pours
a
golden
cooper
like
color
with
a
good
size
white
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
weaker
but
had
a
bit
of
a
malty
tone
the
taste
was
very
balanced
a
nice
spice
note
very
similar
to
other
marzens
the
taste
was
very
balanced
it
was
overpowering
but
wasnt
watery
either
overall
i
found
this
one
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
marzens
out
there
o
wasnt
that
impressed
with
this
one
big
malts
and
nothing
else
very
one
dimensional
another
sessionable
new
glarus
beer
fortunately
for
those
doing
oktoberfest
in
wisconsin
what
about
the
rest
of
us
appears
on
the
lighter
yelloworange
side
of
amber
in
color
transparent
with
lively
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
one
finger
of
head
recedes
to
a
skim
layer
no
lacing
smells
of
medium
strength
lightly
toasted
bready
malt
and
mostly
earthy
spectrum
noble
hopping
tastes
of
the
same
but
with
a
sharp
dropoff
of
the
noble
hopping
in
the
mid
sip
that
leaves
the
finish
as
a
gradual
fadeout
of
the
malt
sweetness
stays
clean
and
simple
without
being
boring
lighter
bodied
and
brisk
on
the
palate
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
at
least
once
o
for
around
9
bucks
a
sixer
this
is
hard
to
pass
up
it
passes
strict
german
muster
tastes
right
and
tastes
good
flavors
of
sweet
graham
cracker
tea
leaves
wet
barley
light
feel
fairly
malty
nothing
to
really
pontificate
on
but
a
solid
malty
lager
with
no
off
flavors
prost
overall
another
solid
ng
beer
not
high
on
flavor
but
looks
and
smells
good
with
a
clean
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
too
if
youre
into
oktobers
this
one
is
worth
a
drink
every
year
o
fall
football
staghorn
this
is
a
great
brew
and
i
always
look
forward
to
it
o
a
real
oktoberfest
with
very
rich
sugar
biscuit
and
spice
flavors
i
tend
to
go
back
to
this
as
my
fall
session
beer
very
drinkable
but
flavorful
o
giving
this
a
4
for
overall
because
its
well
worth
sampling
even
though
it
doesnt
really
fit
a
true
märzen
oktoberfest
in
style
i
really
wish
ng
would
start
using
some
of
the
imported
malts
used
in
2
women
but
maybe
ill
just
grab
more
2
women
for
my
oktoberfest
pleasure
o
an
easy
style
to
overlook
but
this
one
is
delicious
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
year
edita
little
bit
of
a
yeast
taste
when
i
had
one
of
the
last
two
left
from
my
six
pack
interesting
o
while
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
still
enjoyed
it
i
will
have
to
try
and
get
some
this
year
so
i
can
compare
the
two
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
healthy
dosing
of
roasted
malts
a
light
spiciness
and
a
marzen
yeast
that
brings
more
earthy
grain
malt
qualities
out
overall
this
is
really
good
stuff
for
a
marzen
smoother
than
probably
any
that
i
have
had
and
can
compare
to
this
extremely
drinkable
and
glad
to
have
a
few
more
waiting
next
stop
germany
for
a
comparison
taste
is
typical
oktoberfest
malty
slightly
astringent
after
taste
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
am
just
not
a
lager
fan
in
general
i
have
had
only
a
couple
of
this
style
that
i
say
i
really
rate
highly
nothing
personal
this
one
is
true
to
type
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
just
a
little
bit
of
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
a
pretty
nice
smell
not
overpowering
tastes
of
roasted
malt
with
the
hops
coming
through
as
well
this
is
a
nice
octoberfest
beer
good
feel
and
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
its
probably
been
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
months
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
it
this
fall
soft
mouthfeel
consistency
just
north
of
water
in
a
word
excellent
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
its
not
cloying
theres
a
nice
maltiness
to
it
thats
very
chewy
and
creamy
the
hops
balance
it
out
very
well
leaving
a
nice
dry
finish
quite
solid
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
i
could
drink
one
maybe
two
and
be
good
for
a
while
at
first
i
was
nervous
when
i
took
my
first
whiff
of
this
beer
as
the
aromas
did
not
appeal
to
me
however
as
this
beer
warmed
in
the
glass
it
became
a
very
good
beer
and
a
joy
to
drink

pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
stale
grainy
malt
flavor
of
sweet
light
malts
and
a
grainy
crackery
finish
some
excess
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
on
the
bland
side
but
ok
overall
for
an
oktoberfest
d
finished
off
quite
easily
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfests
this
year
new
glarus
is
very
well
known
in
wisconsin
for
making
great
beer
and
this
oktoberfest
if
no
exception
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
and
you
take
in
a
mild
scent
of
spices
the
initial
sip
seems
a
little
weak
but
is
followed
by
an
explosion
of
spices
that
tickle
your
taste
buds
that
drinks
rather
smooth
definetly
an
oktoberfest
worth
trying
d
glad
i
had
tried
the
brew
but
it
didnt
do
a
lot
for
me
actually
a
bit
disappointed
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
again
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
very
good
its
a
very
clean
and
crisp
beer
that
also
has
some
good
flavors
and
excellent
balance
an
excellent
version
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
pretty
much
as
drinkable
as
i
can
imagine
a
beer
with
more
than
6
alcohol
being
easy
going
down
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
savor
so
it
would
be
a
shame
to
drink
it
too
quickly
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
moderate
sweetness
at
leadoff
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
carboanted
palate
that
has
mild
fruit
flavors
mild
apples
but
not
spoiled
the
finish
isnt
dry
its
balance
and
has
no
bitterness
its
about
as
easy
drinking
as
a
beer
gets
id
have
another
shit
i
have
another
thanks
beerwolf
like
any
good
oktoberfest
i
cant
seem
to
put
staghorn
down
new
glarus
never
seems
to
disappoint
me
especially
in
the
lager
department
what
a
remarkable
beer
clean
with
not
off
flavors
even
the
malt
sweetness
does
not
show
a
caramel
tone
to
it
which
most
american
versions
do
very
drinkable
and
a
sure
pick
ill
be
seeking
this
beer
out
next
year
no
doubt
d
theres
absolutely
nothing
detracting
from
this
beers
drinkability
its
clean
its
balanced
its
tasty
and
the
abv
is
reasonable
d
this
is
a
great
octoberfest
beer
this
is
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
a
seasonaloctoberfest
beer
it
hard
to
have
one
outstanding
job
new
glarus
drinkability
is
great
finishes
crisp
and
clean
could
drink
liters
of
this
do
good
interpretation
of
the
style
somehow
an
underrated
new
glarus
brew
due
to
their
relative
dominance
in
the
unpluggedrdfruit
area
perhaps
very
refreshing
yearly
staple
dvery
flavorful
very
smooth
making
for
a
nice
evening
if
your
fridge
is
stocked
with
this
beer
d
id
love
to
sit
and
drink
a
1l
stein
of
this
the
tastiness
of
this
has
inspired
me
to
go
and
pick
up
some
genuine
oktoberfests
while
theyre
still
fresh
on
shelves
really
good
oktoberfest
great
drinkability
with
a
smooth
finish
not
hard
to
throw
a
couple
back
after
a
long
fall
day
at
work
i
just
recieved
this
from
florida9
in
a
bif
the
pour
is
a
clear
copper
with
an
above
average
white
head
lots
of
caramel
and
earthy
malt
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
full
of
sweet
malt
and
earthy
notes
with
a
lingering
sweet
finish
a
well
balanced
fest
beer
that
i
am
very
glad
to
be
enjoying
d
aside
from
great
lakes
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
of
this
season
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptional
wellrefined
oktoberfestbier
possibly
my
favorite
got
to
hand
it
to
new
glarus
for
keeping
the
malt
sweetness
subdued
not
terribly
complex
but
to
my
mind
the
style
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
in
abundance
staghorn
is
perfect
in
this
regard
d
very
well
executed
nicely
executed
feel
and
malt
profile
with
a
great
balance
up
there
with
my
favorites
for
the
style
ng
never
ceases
to
impress
thanks
to
a74gent
for
the
trade
taste
is
mostly
sweet
a
sort
of
buttery
sugar
caramel
deal
corn
is
a
light
flavor
hanging
in
the
background
everything
comes
back
to
sweetness
cant
say
much
more
its
not
as
diverse
and
some
beers
but
its
simplicity
is
pure
and
clean
with
a
crisp
hops
bite
that
doesnt
really
hit
with
any
extreme
bitterness
adding
a
bit
of
citrus
that
cleans
the
palette
extremely
refreshing
and
tasty
there
are
not
many
beers
that
can
make
simple
seems
sophisiticated
this
beer
has
almost
the
bare
essentials
in
terms
of
flavor
but
its
execution
is
impecable
this
is
a
homerun
balance
of
tradition
and
innovation
hands
down
the
best
octoberfest
ive
had
recently
fairly
complex
in
character
for
a
marzen
im
used
to
a
sweeter
malt
profile
but
i
can
see
pounding
a
staghorn
or
two
every
harvest
moon
or
so
vielen
dank
again
thanks

poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
large
mug
it
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
head
that
dissipated
sort
of
quickly
it
smelled
sweet
and
malty
i
spent
a
long
while
just
enjoying
the
great
smell
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
great
its
fruity
and
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
i
didnt
really
mind
it
i
could
drink
this
beer
one
after
the
other
and
enjoy
every
drop
of
it
truly
a
great
beer
tm
the
taste
is
a
classic
oktoberfest
lager
with
rich
notes
of
caramel
hoppy
undertones
of
spicy
clove
rich
in
taste
and
the
body
is
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
one
of
a
number
of
beers
sampled
during
a
fishing
weekend
in
northern
wisconsin
this
entry
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
burnt
caramelized
caramel
orange
rind
flowers
and
indian
corn
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dry
toffee
light
tobacco
orange
peel
light
maple
syrup
and
light
sweet
honey
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
ofest
not
the
best
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
vdubb
would
agree
with
me
that
this
ones
talked
up
a
bit
too
much
though
got
this
on
a
guys
weekend
trip
up
to
the
northwoods
of
wisconsin
as
a
lover
of
the
style
im
really
excited
to
get
my
hands
on
this
to
taste
the
hype
it
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
frothy
ecru
head
the
smell
is
fairly
vacant
for
most
of
the
oktoberfests
that
im
used
to
there
is
obviously
the
distinct
smell
of
malts
and
in
this
instance
there
is
a
slight
citrus
smell
from
what
seems
to
be
hops
on
the
trail
end
there
is
a
hint
of
orange
zest
in
addition
to
the
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
exactly
as
it
smells
with
the
hoppiness
causing
a
slight
bittering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
ive
gotta
say
maybe
its
that
ive
heard
such
good
things
about
this
one
or
maybe
its
because
this
is
more
of
the
traditional
german
style
that
is
not
my
preference
this
is
not
the
best
oktoberfest
available
and
that
in
itself
is
a
disappointment
its
pretty
drinkable
and
carbonated
right
and
not
a
bad
ofest
just
its
not
my
favorite
overall
a
very
nice
octoberfest
world
class
hmmm
not
so
sure
about
that
one
but
it
is
a
dang
good
brew
i
polished
off
4
while
grilling
chickens
and
watching
tennessee
get
their
rear
end
handed
to
them
by
florida
so
i
must
have
enjoyed
it
some
d
1
5
as
the
weeks
have
rolled
past
each
bottle
seems
less
appealing
than
the
last
have
not
even
finished
the
last
several
theres
just
something
weird
in
the
flavor
and
burpbackprobably
the
alcoholic
fruitloopyness
with
a
touch
of
aftershave
want
to
keep
liking
it
but
i
cant
i
like
new
glarus
d
light
and
crisp
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
which
we
all
know
by
now
is
ngs
m
o
it
may
not
be
spot
on
style
wise
but
is
still
very
balanced
and
tasty
for
full
disclosure
i
got
this
because
i
was
looking
for
a
sixer
of
something
from
new
glarus
while
i
was
still
home
and
the
badass
bottle
lept
out
at
me
awhooo
very
decent
and
im
very
glad
i
gave
this
another
shot
d
pretty
drinkable
nice
take
on
the
marzen
not
world
class
but
wouldnt
turn
this
down
overall
really
good
i
am
enjoying
this
so
much
i
am
thinking
of
how
i
can
get
a
keg
of
it
or
try
to
find
a
clone
recipe
to
homebrew
it
a
wonderful
session
beer
with
just
enough
complexity
to
make
you
want
another
the
great
balance
in
this
beer
also
makes
it
fun
to
drink
as
one
sip
reveals
more
hop
bitternesshop
flavors
and
the
next
brings
out
more
of
the
malt
flavors
another
winner
for
new
glarus
j
thanks
george
for
the
first
of
a
few
good
extras
im
looking
forward
to
thanks
jeff
the
taste
is
sweet
light
malts
with
some
toasted
bread
and
spicy
hops
especially
in
the
finish
its
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
for
the
style
with
the
carbonation
not
getting
in
the
way
of
the
feel
overall
an
excellent
oktoberfest
overall
an
above
average
marzen
lets
hope
this
is
my
last
okto
so
i
can
end
on
a
high
note
good
heaviness
good
carbonation
very
beer
favorable
good
drinker
a
session
beer
if
not
for
the
above
6
abv
ill
take
this
all
year
round
over
anything
made
in
germany
a
different
rendition
of
a
german
octoberfest
which
is
more
pale
and
on
the
lighter
side
for
its
style
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
anyways
in
summation
one
of
my
favorite
midwest
breweries
one
of
my
least
favorite
and
seemingly
unadventurous
brews
from
them
mild
taste
some
would
call
it
smooth
i
guess
if
theyre
fans
of
it
i
guess
if
you
like
a
mild
brown
ale
with
more
carbonation
this
is
your
thing
notes
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
american
octoberfest
and
probably
favorite
marzen
period
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
new
glarus
sure
crafts
their
beers
right
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
autumn
beer
next
year
ill
definitely
pick
up
some
stags
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
well
bodied
nice
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
small
hint
of
earthy
hops
while
my
list
of
beer
to
try
is
ever
so
large
i
could
see
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
to
celebrate
the
end
of
summer
and
coming
of
autumn
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
if
the
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
crisper
without
the
astringent
bite
itd
be
even
better
and
more
drinkable
still
one
of
the
better
domestic
ofests
ive
had
worth
seeking
out
another
solid
offering
from
ng
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
and
consider
it
the
best
american
octoberfest
ive
ever
had
drinkable
and
flavorful
with
none
of
the
off
notes
that
i
often
perceive
in
the
style
d
for
how
light
this
beer
is
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
really
easy
to
session
considering
the
alcohol
content
very
nice
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
as
a
lighter
octoberfest
this
aint
the
beer
you
have
to
commit
thirtyforty
minutes
to
drink
if
you
want
to
sample
some
other
beers
after
this
beer
wont
stand
in
the
way
its
simple
to
the
point
yet
savory
all
rolled
into
one
i
highly
recommend
thanks
to
a
friend
from
wi
i
was
able
to
savor
a
few
of
these
while
in
cincinnati
the
body
on
this
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
would
like
but
still
decent
nice
slight
bittering
hops
at
the
forefront
but
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
of
fresh
bread
and
toasted
malts
this
is
really
good
some
of
the
characteristics
could
be
tweaked
a
bit
but
its
good
where
it
counts
flavor
looks
very
nice
when
poured
into
a
glass
mug
dark
reddish
copper
big
frothy
head
toasty
bready
malt
a
little
grapefruit
in
the
nose
nice
smelling
beer
nice
tasting
beer
too
more
malty
toasted
grain
than
hop
presance
but
the
hops
are
in
there
nicely
balanced
brew
this
is
very
crisp
and
clean
no
unwanted
flavors
creamy
malty
mouthfeel
this
is
by
far
the
best
thing
i
have
tried
from
new
glarus
best
oktoberfest
around
in
my
opinion
too
bottle
via
trade
thanks
to
badbeer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
foamy
onefinger
white
head
aroma
is
caramel
grain
earth
and
mild
toast
flavor
is
pretty
wellbalanced
but
not
amazing
with
sweet
caramel
malt
mild
roast
earth
toffee
and
some
hop
bitterness
palate
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
body
is
mediumlight
this
is
nice
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
drinkability
is
high
pours
a
nice
copperorange
color
with
a
small
head
like
most
marzenfest
brews
it
looks
good
the
smell
is
bready
malts
and
toasted
caramel
the
taste
is
way
good
its
a
smooth
malt
and
bready
crisp
hops
a
very
well
balanced
oktoberfest
mmmm
this
one
is
good
ng
makes
world
class
brews
and
this
one
is
outstanding
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
marzen
to
date
on
a
style
that
is
not
my
favorite
but
of
course
this
time
of
the
year
i
drink
plenty
this
one
is
highly
recommended
for
its
superior
well
crafted
representation
of
the
style
its
just
a
beautiful
tasty
brew
find
this
one
or
trade
for
it
im
glad
ng
is
so
close
to
home
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
with
a
soft
and
clean
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
highly
recommended
very
nice
very
easy
drinking
beer
like
this
one
drinkability
is
decent
very
drinkable
but
only
because
the
brew
lacks
any
distinct
characteristics
not
the
best
brew
from
new
glarus
but
worth
a
try
the
beer
is
a
copperorange
with
a
white
head
the
nose
isnt
very
big
on
this
beer
but
it
has
a
nice
breadybiscuit
note
that
comes
through
the
flavour
is
full
of
breadytoasty
flavours
with
a
slight
hop
bite
its
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
some
sweetness
comes
through
which
is
unexpected
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
except
its
solid
another
great
beer
by
new
glarus
poured
into
the
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
showed
an
amber
body
not
red
as
the
label
description
suggests
and
a
puffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
clean
malt
i
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
medium
bodied
with
a
bready
biscuity
but
also
strawlike
malt
flavor
that
becomes
less
appealing
as
i
drink
i
had
much
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
kind
of
boring
overall
im
sorry
to
say
i
wont
be
picking
up
a
6
pack
this
year
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
that
i
expected
something
a
little
more
styleconsistent
from
the
folks
at
new
glarus
and
this
seems
not
to
be
an
oktoberfest
but
some
strange
hybrid
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
straightforward
but
the
balance
creates
interesting
complexities
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
just
plain
good
beer
dit
is
an
everyday
beer

in
the
transformative

almost

nothing
that

from
any
amount
of
time
lacing
from

doesnt
last
either
smell
is
lager
yeast
at
best
maybe
some
malts
there
too
but
barely
there
my
friend
smelled
a
fart
in
the
glass
not
mine
either
taste
is
actually
not
bad
sweet
but
not
overly
light
crisp

balanced

medium
carbonation
for
a

i
dont
generally
go
for
this
isnt
a
bad
example
cheers
to
taturbo
for
the
brew
not
a
great

profile
there
are
a
lot
of
complexities
to
the

its

id
be
content
with
a
six

for
a

a
strong

an
inch

a
half

only
slight
dots

is
a
deep
mahogany
amber
in
color
nose
has
tones
of
rustic
spices
limestone
and
some
sweet
malt
to
balance
the
minerals
minerals
and
malt
are
the
first
things
to
show
through
as
you
start
to
drink
then
a
nice
crisp
feel
really
makes
this
beer
standout
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
a
crisp
dry
almost
green
apple
likefel
comes
about
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
a
good
german
pilsner
refreshing
yet
rich
and
rustic
i
could
dring
these
all
night
and
year
round
i
wish
id
bought
a
case
or
two
drinkability
probably
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
the
scratch
13
was
damned
good
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
it
seemed
to
have
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
nutty
and
toasty
with
just
a
kiss
of
hops
at
the
finish
tasty
stuff
that
ill
actually
stock
up
on
next
year
come
october
and
i
have
a
craving
for
oktoberfests
again
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
well
balanced
with
a
nice
subtle
yeasty
smell
and
flavor
pours
a
see
through
reddish
brown
with
nice
white
head
that
lingers
a
fairly
long
time
nice
carbonation
running
up
the
sides
continuously
smells
of
caramely
malts
and
slight
citrus
hops
very
crisp
refreshing
brew
starts
with
a
nice
sweet
malty
backbone
with
tinge
of
hops
to
round
it
out
very
balanced
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drinkwhich
is
pretty
much
ngs
standard
when
it
comes
to
the
6packs
nice
beer
overall
it
has
been
my
favorite
wisconsin
oktoberfest
for
a
couple
of
years
now
i
cant
drink
a
capital
okto
once
ive
had
a
stag
nice
brew
md
its
a
smooth
drinker
and
it
would
be
easy
to
put
3
or
4
of
these
back
on
a
fall
day
for
sure
its
going
to
be
hard
to
find
now
but
keep
your
eyes
open
for
it
drinkability
sure
this
ones
fairly
solid
and
though
it
may
be
a
little
stale
i
can
detect
what
was
once
a
pretty
dang
good
beer
plenty
of
solid
reasonably
complex
malt
notes
alongside
an
understated
balancing
bitterness
and
hop
presence
and
a
reasonable
abv
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
as
well
md
full
bodied
and
sily
smooth
an
incredibly
easy
drinker
a
touch
light
on
the
carbonation
but
still
a
great
feel
dissapointed
d
an
outstanding
festbier
and
one
i
will
surely
seek
out
again
next
year
very
drinkable
highly
sessionable
d
this
is
a
great
ofest
it
is
great
tasting
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
real
surprise
this
beer
is
very
good
and
probably
the
best
octoberfest
i
ever
had
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
my
area
i
would
love
to
drink
this
in
september
and
october
well
done
new
glarus
your
first
beer
i
tried
i
loved
da
very
enjoyable
beer
not
a
style
i
usually
seek
out
but
i
will
make
this
one
an
annual
grab
overall
despite
not
liking
the
oktoberfest
style
this
is
the
best
one
i
have
had
that
fine
line
between
sweetness
and
dryness
good
un
pours
an
orange
brown
color
with
magnificent
clarity
and
a
sturdy
medium
sized
white
head
that
leaves
some
sticking
nice
nose
of
sweet
roasted
malt
fire
wood
and
a
sweet
nuttiness
much
is
the
same
with
its
flavor
nothing
offensive
going
on
here
incredible
drinkability
highly
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
big
thanks
to
demcorhip
for
throwing
this
in
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
great
drinakability
another
winner
from
from
new
glarus
d
my
idea
of
the
perfect
session
beer
i
can
throw
this
down
all
night
not
even
finished
with
the
1st
glass
and
wanting
to
pop
another
just
a
quick
little
foam
after
a
good
that
disappears
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
great
deep
amer
with
some
ruby
hues
but
practically
no
bubbling
heavily
toasted
malts
with
a
lot
of
straight
unmilled
grain
aromas
with
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
very
bready
and
grainy
this
is
close
to
what
the
ld
school
german
octoberfest
tasted
like
heavy
toasted
malts
and
in
this
case
grassyminty
hops
balancing
things
out
a
bit
the
palate
is
a
bit
rough
in
the
begining
of
the
palate
but
smooths
out
towards
the
end
this
beer
could
use
some
smoothing
out
thanks
again
nick
d
a
very
drinkable
fall
offering
not
stupendously
complex
but
a
solid
allaround
brew
another
quality
beer
from
new
glarus
clear
amber
body
with
golden
highlights
around
the
edges
big
three
finger
white
head
with
ample
lacing
aroma
of
husky
grainy
malts
not
much
in
the
way
of
caramel
like
so
many
other
american
ofests
but
i
like
that
nice
and
traditional
clean
flavor
of
toasty
malts
sufficiently
sweet
slightly
hoppy
a
little
herbal
and
a
little
floral
light
carbonation
yet
crisp
a
very
nice
ofest
and
even
though
the
abv
is
over
6
is
drinkable
as
hell
and
could
see
myself
putting
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
autumn
evening
probably
the
best
american
ofest
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
tasty
oktoberfest
whose
greatest
asset
i
think
is
how
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
is
for
me
nothing
big
and
bold
here
just
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
another
winner
from
new
glarus
poured
a
nice
crystal
clear
amber
but
the
head
was
disappointing
and
disappeared
quickly
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
citrus
malty
taste
too
medium
carbonation
nice
hoppy
finish
very
fresh
tasting
beer
with
mediumfull
body
very
drinkable
could
tell
it
had
a
higher
abv
after
a
couple
of
drinks
due
to
a
little
alcohol
warming
i
liked
everything
about
this
beer
but
that
doesnt
help
make
it
anything
special
id
buy
more
but
wouldnt
make
a
special
trip
or
pay
extra
for
it
d
this
beer
is
very
clean
in
flavor
even
as
it
warms
taste
mouthfeel
opens
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
but
this
is
actually
more
on
the
dry
side
toasted
whole
grain
bread
with
fruit
preserves
comes
to
mind
herbal
hops
linger
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
but
only
mildly
bitter
ideal
for
autumn
quaffing
great
stuff
here
much
better
than
many
american
attempts
at
the
style
worthwhile
purchase
wish
new
glarus
was
available
in
indiana
d
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
an
easy
drinker
definitely
would
be
easy
to
knock
down
an
entire
sixpack
of
these
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
there
was
a
very
small
white
head
on
it
that
went
away
almost
immediately
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
some
slightly
spicy
hops
it
has
a
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
caramel
malts
with
some
spiciness
it
is
a
very
well
executed
oktoberfest
this
stuff
is
so
clean
and
so
smooth
its
kind
of
remarkable
how
much
flavor
they
still
pack
into
it
one
might
say
its
the
slightest
bit
boring
with
its
unadulterated
mellow
malt
flavor
but
nobody
should
complain
about
its
taste
and
craftsmanship
d
hard
to
put
this
one
down
id
definitely
go
for
a
second
and
a
third
sorry
this
is
only
a
seasonal
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
pretty
good
beer
overall
ive
been
trying
many
oktoberfests
lately
due
to
the
availability
this
time
of
year
and
this
one
certainly
does
stand
out
as
one
i
would
love
to
drink
again
i
would
recommend
this
beer
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
in
recent
memory
i
bought
this
bottle
at
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
this
seasonal
brew
pours
copper
and
foamy
pretty
typical
appearance
for
an
american
oktoberfest
aroma
is
not
stong
but
the
taste
is
satisfying
toasty
malt
no
caramel
but
some
sweetness
with
a
dry
finish
satisfying
mouthfeel
and
highly
quaffable
d
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
brew
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
from
new
glarus
but
a
solid
offering
i
like
most
new
glarus
beers
but
there
are
a
few
i
just
dont
get
this
one
goes
on
that
list
the
high
abv
does
not
aid
in
drinkability
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
medium
sized
head
the
roasted
malts
are
the
thing
that
really
stick
out
to
me
about
this
beer
and
is
something
that
hasnt
been
matched
in
the
other
oktoberfests
that
i
have
tried
that
being
said
it
is
the
best
oktoberfest
that
i
have
tried
beating
out
capital
and
great
lakes
among
others
i
am
definitely
going
to
go
pick
up
some
more
before
the
season
is
over
this
is
another
strong
beer
from
new
glarus
the
more
staghorn
i
drink
the
more
i
want
to
drink
this
stuff
continues
to
grow
on
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
come
across
d
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
than
id
like
but
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
stunning
clear
redcopper
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
thin
layer
which
eventually
disappears
some
bits
of
stickiness
here
and
there
on
the
sides
but
not
much
to
speak
of
scent
consists
of
toasted
grains
mild
caramel
and
crystal
malts
and
a
some
metallic
notes
an
interesting
pepper
and
spice
with
an
earthy
hop
tickle
the
nose
as
well
pretty
tame
smell
overall
though
taste
begins
with
some
roasted
nuts
and
pale
malts
with
a
bready
characteristic
midway
some
sweet
caramel
and
honey
with
a
light
dry
pepper
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
strong
carbonation
sting
and
a
crisp
body
drinkable
you
betcha
especially
with
the
surprising
6
5
abv
not
a
bad
ofest
but
i
expect
more
from
new
glarus
thanks
again
joe
for
this
extra
super
quenching
i
had
a
pint
of
point
a
capital
brewing
co
ofests
also
and
this
ng
one
blew
the
other
two
away
it
is
so
smooth
that
it
is
probably
not
to
style
but
i
dont
care
i
love
this
beer
and
am
going
to
stock
up
on
some
comment
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
it
has
a
pretty
complex
taste
but
not
too
much
flavor
that
over
whelms
just
right
for
drinking
one
or
having
more
than
a
few
it
pours
to
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
nice
1
plus
head
good
lacing
throughout
mostly
maltiness
on
the
nose
some
caramel
and
honey
present
similar
taste
profile
here
with
the
malts
dominating
where
this
beer
excels
is
in
drinkability
it
slides
down
almost
too
easily
quite
sessionable
on
a
nice
late
september
evening
it
is
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
last
year
and
was
anticipating
staghorn
for
the
last
few
weeks
not
a
very
exciting
beer
ive
had
more
flavorful
oktoberfests
it
went
down
easily
and
without
any
glaring
faults
but
its
a
little
timid
and
the
sourtart
finish
i
couldve
done
without
i
prefer
a
bit
more
flavor
andor
depth
andor
character
in
general
and
hoped
for
something
maltier
in
this
particular
beer
not
at
all
bad
just
one
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
this
beers
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
beautiful
honeyish
amber
brown
smells
like
fall
to
me
brilliant
wheaty
malted
aroma
honey
vanilla
floral
notes
come
together
like
a
mountain
meadow
in
fall
this
beer
just
screams
autumn
and
the
outdoors
to
me
the
taste
is
not
at
all
a
letdown
the
malt
is
predominantwith
robust
carameland
a
delightful
tinge
of
hoppiness
is
a
lovely
counter
sweetness
and
bitterness
combine
ohh
so
well
with
this
beer
it
really
has
an
extraordinary
balance
and
flavor
profile
for
an
oktoberfest
well
for
any
mediumbodied
beer
for
that
matter
body
is
crisp
and
medium
with
a
favorable
creaminess
to
it
some
cooked
apples
come
through
eventually
a
cracker
this
one
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
but
this
is
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
ones
that
ive
had
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
think
i
waited
to
long
on
this
beer
pours
a
bright
clear
reddish
orange
malt
with
a
small
beige
head
smell
is
sticky
stale
gooey
malt
with
band
aid
qualities
and
metal
probably
not
as
it
was
intended
unappealing
malt
flavor
and
metal
as
well
a
nice
marzen
that
is
very
enjoyable
i
can
definitely
drink
these
all
night
and
might
be
looking
for
some
come
next
september
thanks
lordsloth
for
the
trade
flavour
is
juicy
and
full
of
apples
and
pears
then
followed
by
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
lots
of
grain
damp
earth
then
some
peppery
spice
im
not
going
to
lie
this
is
more
than
a
little
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
a
bit
more
balance
would
be
lovely
mouthfeel
is
very
wet
and
almost
watery
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
in
the
throat
carbonation
is
very
mild
all
in
all
one
will
do
this
is
a
very
sweet
oktoberfest
and
i
prefer
a
little
more
balance
on
the
palate
drinkability
i
can
think
of
a
good
handful
of
oktoberfests
that
i
would
rather
drink
but
many
are
not
as
clean
and
crisp
as
this
i
think
i
need
to
give
this
one
another
go
around
this
fall
but
it
is
definitely
one
i
want
to
try
again
and
did
enjoy
overall
its
malty
and
smooth
with
a
nice
bready
malt
flavor
and
lager
sweetness
the
appearance
is
a
clear
orangeamber
without
much
head
retention
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
hackerpschorrs
ofest
beer
for
being
a
little
big
but
very
smooth
theres
a
slight
mineral
note
with
the
bread
loaf
aroma
which
i
suppose
is
appropriate
for
a
german
style
lager
theres
also
a
dry
biscuit
and
toffee
finish
thats
quite
pleasant
and
hints
of
herbal
hops
around
the
edges
this
is
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
fill
my
stein
with
cheers
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
no
cloying
or
overpowering
tastes
make
this
one
very
sessionable
d
good
beer
this
is
a
good
octoberfest
beer
pours
a
orangeish
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
malty
sweetness
as
for
the
taste
again
a
dry
malty
sweetness
that
is
quite
balanced
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
sweet
and
malty
dry
end
and
a
decent
oktoberfest
drinkability
pretty
tasty
i
will
defeninitely
keep
my
eyes
open
for
this
beer
next
season
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
my
first
whiff
was
of
strong
roasted
malts
my
first
sip
was
full
of
strong
graininess
with
a
snap
at
the
finish
this
beer
clean
and
refreshing
throughout
the
drink
carbonation
is
key
in
releasing
the
wonderful
balance
of
this
beer
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
but
you
may
have
to
wait
until
next
year
as
i
snagged
this
from
a
friend
whom
forgot
he
had
it
in
the
back
of
his
fridge
i
am
very
please
with
this
brew
i
recommended
many
a
friend
try
the
staghorn
this
past
fall
i
would
happily
enjoy
this
one
while
relaxing
at
any
taproom
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
want
on
draft
to
experience
the
nuances
over
the
course
of
a
liter
or
so
i
feel
like
one
bottle
doesnt
let
you
get
to
know
it
enough
of
all
the
octoberfests
ive
tried
this
fallwinter
this
is
my
favorite
considering
surlyfest
has
been
changed
to
rye
beer
finally
found
a
fest
beer
that
hits
the
right
spot
between
sweetness
dryness
and
alcohol
level
another
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
emitting
spiciness
that
resulted
in
a
good
brew
drinkability
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
consoles
you
when
the
summers
over
very
tasty
even
quaffable
and
its
from
a
fantastic
local
brewer
mouthfeel
perfect
crisp
flavor
is
dry
toasty
malt
with
a
clean
dry
finish
just
a
touch
bitter
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
easy
to
down
this
one
rapidly
and
reach
for
more
great
job
with
the
style
very
solid
oktoberfest
here
from
new
glarus
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
on
a
fall
night
drinkability
like
i
said
earlier
near
perfect
balance
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
hope
that
theres
another
6er
sitting
at
the
beer
store
served
chilled
in
a
mug
now
this
was
an
excellent
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
had
plenty
of
them
this
year
but
this
one
really
stood
out
to
me
luckily
received
it
in
a
bif
or
i
never
would
have
even
known
about
it
poured
a
nice
bright
amber
with
a
good
hint
of
orange
the
ample
carbonation
led
to
the
formation
of
a
nice
thick
white
head
of
lace
about
two
inches
tall
good
retention
left
behind
some
nice
concentric
rings
of
side
glass
lace
and
a
nice
frothy
film
on
top
the
aroma
was
very
crisp
fresh
with
a
nice
grassy
tone
some
bready
malts
lingering
in
the
back
the
flavor
followed
right
along
coming
through
with
a
big
backbone
of
bread
like
malts
with
a
very
nice
grassy
kind
of
twang
to
it
some
nice
little
nuances
of
spice
hiding
in
the
back
and
a
good
little
dry
hoppy
like
finish
to
it
nice
light
to
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
gave
a
great
smooth
feel
and
this
one
was
defiantly
a
winner
i
was
thrilled
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
this
was
the
best
of
all
the
oktoberfest
i
had
this
year
it
had
such
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
session
ability
that
it
was
unmatched
the
great
little
bursts
of
flavor
and
extra
little
pop
that
seemed
to
be
in
it
just
pulled
it
apart
from
the
crowd
a
really
great
brew
and
absolutely
perfect
for
the
season
will
be
looking
for
this
next
year
fairly
light
body
and
little
carbonation
make
it
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
courtesy
of
someone
awesome
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
lightly
toasted
with
hints
of
fresh
honeyed
biscuit
the
body
is
a
dark
orange
amber
and
holds
a
diminishing
off
white
head
the
first
sip
offers
a
somewhat
dry
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
toward
the
swallow
has
some
almost
nutty
notes
lightly
toasty
again
it
finishes
dry
with
a
breadlike
grainy
kiss
of
sweetness
decent
but
different
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
that
is
wellworth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
i
could
see
myself
plowing
through
a
sixpack
with
ease
and
enjoying
each
sip
the
whole
package
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
light
to
medium
body
makes
for
a
tasty
refreshing
and
fairly
sessionable
beer
the
only
obstacle
is
the
alcohol
which
at
6
25
would
start
to
catch
up
with
the
drinker
somewhat
quickly
a
brew
ive
enjoyed
before
and
helped
get
me
into
taking
beer
much
more
seriously
and
a
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
back
after
a
year
hiatus
hope
to
see
and
drink
it
again
next
year
d
overall
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
probably
the
best
ive
had
this
year
might
seem
a
bit
thin
and
bland
if
you
drink
it
too
cold
pours
a
dark
copper
red
with
thin
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
smell
is
biscuity
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
citruis
hop
has
the
malty
flavor
of
a
marzen
but
subtle
compared
to
other
ofest
brews
higher
level
of
hops
compared
to
the
traditional
german
marzens
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
where
it
should
be
leaves
a
pleasent
malt
aftertaste
that
is
not
overpowering
but
reminds
you
of
what
you
just
drank
overall
enjoyable
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
better
but
only
because
new
glarus
has
put
out
outstanding
brews
before
a
keeper
for
sure
d
very
tasty
i
think
this
one
could
hang
with
any
of
the
german
oktoberfests
pours
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
amber
color
head
retains
well
smell
is
slightly
floral
biscuity
and
a
hint
of
a
lagerlike
smell
light
dms
pretty
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
seems
to
have
a
higher
level
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
seem
to
remember
a
rich
smell
of
fresh
malt
similar
to
that
at
the
brewery
or
when
im
homebrewing
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
it
as
much
carbonation
is
medium
and
its
medium
bodied
sits
pretty
good
on
the
tongue
pretty
damn
good
beer
better
than
my
numbers
may
reflect
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
huge
malty
aroma
jumping
out
at
me
like
the
previous
batch
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
with
red
hues
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
biscuits
and
grass
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
some
nice
nutty
flavors
appearing
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
an
oktoberfest
while
the
carbonation
is
nice
overall
this
is
another
overhyped
disappointment
from
new
glarus
it
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
i
dont
think
its
so
good
that
i
would
search
for
it
da
really
good
beer
but
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
less
appeling
it
is
i
would
still
have
to
say
spaten
is
1
imo
pours
a
rusty
copper
color
with
a
nice
finger
worth
of
fluffy
white
foam
aroma
is
spicy
some
apple
salty
water
fresh
earthy
hops
and
little
roasted
malts
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
more
fruity
and
malty
and
some
bread
and
yeast
flavors
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
both
medium
easy
to
drink
but
i
guess
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
out
there
a
little
too
nutty
for
my
taste
however
flavor
is
wonderful
the
body
is
rich
and
full
but
at
no
point
overpowering
or
filling
the
tongue
rolls
in
waves
of
toffee
and
toast
the
malts
are
just
huge
but
this
never
seems
unbalanced
each
sip
finishes
with
a
nice
dose
of
herbalfloral
german
hops
the
palate
dries
just
enough
to
want
another
sip
of
the
sweet
malty
brew
perfectly
drinkable
my
favorite
american
oktoberfest
hands
down
d
very
nice
oktoberfest
would
have
like
the
head
to
have
a
bit
more
volume
think
it
would
have
aided
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
again
another
nice
beer
from
new
glarus
this
one
really
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
too
yearning
for
another
one
now
d
had
a
couple
back
to
back
nice
brew
for
easy
drinking
i
can
tell
this
would
have
shone
in
its
day
hopefully
new
glarus
will
bring
this
one
back
next
year
a
drinkable
beer
but
should
be
bigger
in
texture
and
flavor
to
match
the
style
drinkability
is
solid
if
not
a
little
one
dimensional
and
boring
this
oktoberfest
poured
a
clear
coppery
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
but
clinged
a
bit
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
rich
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
malty
and
rich
with
a
light
munich
malt
flavor
there
were
notes
of
fruit
and
caramel
and
the
hops
came
out
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
finish
and
aftertaste
were
malty
and
hoppy
this
was
a
good
take
on
a
märzen
uf
bottle
smuggled
back
from
my
trip
to
madison
the
code
04327

is
printed
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
creamy
1
light
tan
head
over
the
reddish
copper
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
heavy
coating
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
malts
with
hoppiness
present
but
not
dominant
flavor
is
as
the
nose
indicated
nutty
grains
and
sedate
hops
balancing
each
other
just
what
i
would
expect
from
an
octoberfest
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
and
the
only
thing
that
may
detract
from
the
drinkability
is
the
sweetness
starts
to
become
prominent
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
that
could
be
revisited
beer
is
good
happy
beering
cool
label
a
little
out
of
sorts
for
the
typical
new
glarus
coloronwhite
style
dark
beer
dark
label
i
dunno
regardless
this
beer
pours
reddish
brown
and
rather
clear
with
a
thin
consistent
layer
of
tightlypacked
film
intricate
oval
patterns
on
the
surface
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
is
smoky
sweet
malts
with
rich
tangy
fruits
like
nearripe
apricots
and
plums
some
gluey
notes
and
tea
leaf
aromas
give
it
an
off
character
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
abrasive
for
something
so
smooth
tangy
metallic
hops
meet
an
odd
sour
flavor
in
the
finish
gingerbready
malt
adds
some
good
flavor
and
then
excessive
fruit
and
sharp
alcohol
emerges
essentially
falls
apart
becomes
a
mess
in
your
mouth
does
not
hold
up
to
similar
marzen
ofests
see
hooker
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
is
better
than
average
enjoyable
pours
solid
coppered
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
light
ring
over
top
nose
is
god
balance
between
toasted
nuts
and
toffee
with
a
hint
of
roastyness
in
the
back
flavor
is
fairly
on
with
the
nose
toasty
nutty
very
light
roast
and
toffee
sweetness
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
for
a
fest
beer
nothing
obtrusive
and
very
tasty
serving
type
bottle
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
abv
is
perhaps
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
is
very
settling
this
octoberfest
pours
a
rich
ruby
red
almost
brown
color
medium
white
head
rises
and
fades
rather
quickly
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
with
caramel
and
spice
and
maybe
a
little
hops
in
there
but
what
lacked
in
aroma
more
than
was
made
up
for
in
flavor
this
is
a
really
rich
beer
with
a
nice
thickness
to
the
body
flavor
begins
with
a
nutty
caramel
maltiness
and
thats
the
main
flavor
it
holds
throughout
toasty
bready
and
yeasty
flavors
coming
in
underneath
lighter
fruits
and
spices
from
hops
come
as
i
go
further
finish
is
drier
but
leaves
me
with
a
bit
of
the
caramel
flavor
and
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
this
is
really
a
great
octoberfest
and
one
everybody
should
try
to
get
football
and
oktoberfest
beer
what
a
great
time
of
year
great
wisconsin
octoberfest
drinkability
i
think
ill
be
able
to
polish
off
this
six
pack
and
buy
another
this
beer
pours
very
nicely
and
has
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
that
is
crystal
clear
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
aroma
but
there
was
only
a
hint
of
carmel
and
very
little
hop
presence
to
my
nose
taste
is
very
solid
a
typical
flavorful
german
oktoberfest
marzen
like
most
new
glarus
brews
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
you
could
easily
drink
these
in
quanity
a
nice
local
oktoberfest
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
thanks
again
to
dirtylou
for
sending
me
this
in
a
trade
im
not
a
big
fan
of
octoberfests
but
this
definitely
shows
some
promise
excellent
malt
profile
but
not
too
sweet
very
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
malty
with
mellow
carbonation
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
marzen
that
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
if
you
enjoy
the
style
make
sure
you
find
a
way
to
sample
this
one
quite
a
treat
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
many
saturday
afternoons
watching
notre
dame
win
and
nc
state
lose
while
drinking
these
guys
pours
a
vibrant
amber
color
with
a
smallish
snowwhite
head
smell
is
malty
up
front
spicy
and
citrus
notes
round
it
out
taste
starts
off
strongly
malt
and
finishes
with
a
spicylemony
hop
kick
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
could
use
a
little
softening
around
the
edges
but
overall
stays
quite
drinkable
a
nice
little
marzen
here
not
the
best
ive
had
but
tasty
nonetheless
purchased
at
the
brewery
5th
bottle
of
the
six
pack
12
ounce
bottle
copper
colored
with
a
large
creamy
head
caramel
and
apple
aroma
a
roasted
nutty
smell
too
nutty
malt
flavor
very
yeasty
just
a
little
hop
flavor
some
spice
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
pretty
light
great
drinkability
this
would
make
a
very
good
session
beer
ive
had
most
of
new
glaruss
beers
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
really
enjoy
the
toasted
malt
flavor
but
its
basically
just
a
solid
amber
lager
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
one
of
these
with
me
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
nice
caramel
smell
the
flavor
was
a
mixture
of
a
nut
brown
and
smooth
caramel
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
right
where
i
want
it
moderately
thick
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
good
oktoberfest
little
plain
though
worth
a
try
if
you
like
oktoberfest
and
have
already
had
most
other
offerings
or
want
to
try
them
all
thanks
to
the
beersters
on
the
great
lakes
board
for
reuniting
me
with
a
long
lost
friendmade
a
run
to
woodmans
in
kenosha
and
cleaned
them
out
of
this
seasonal
brew
in
short
its
about
as
good
as
i
remember
with
the
exception
of
a
mild
tinniness
that
i
could
do
without
from
the
beginning
a
beautiful
beer
a
sort
of
deep
amber
that
fits
the
time
of
year
bisquecolored
head
that
lasted
a
good
long
while
the
nose
to
me
is
extremely
floral
and
the
taste
is
not
partcularly
hoppy
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
slightly
tinny
aftertaste
that
i
hope
does
not
taint
the
rest
of
the
3
cases
i
bought
all
in
all
its
good
to
be
home
soft
and
delicate
in
the
mouth
with
light
carbonation
and
medium
body
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
definately
going
to
be
kicking
it
with
this
one
for
awhile
the
softness
just
makes
it
easier
to
throw
back
picked
up
this
cervidinspired
beer
at
chicones
during
a
recent
five
state
border
run
pours
a
ruddy
leathery
falloakleaf
brown
with
brassy
highlights
has
a
soft
mediumsized
darkwhite
head
smells
of
brown
sugar
biscuits
caramelized
carrots
and
spicy
hops
taste
starts
off
with
spiced
carrot
cake
mild
sweetness
that
turns
nutty
and
biscuity
as
the
hops
come
in
and
attack
the
side
of
the
mouth
hops
are
fresh
spicy
and
adequately
balance
the
malt
finish
has
some
tangy
hop
bitterness
and
a
good
dose
of
unsweetened
cookie
malt
medium
bodied
lager
with
lots
of
malt
and
thats
not
too
cloying
but
the
carbonation
seems
a
touch
high
a
very
nice
ofest
but
i
didnt
expect
anything
less
from
new
glarus
another
winner
from
dan
at
new
glarus
beautiful
shiny
amber
body
with
super
light
white
fluffy
head
the
aroma
has
some
definate
malt
presence
but
a
also
a
bit
of
citrus
action
going
on
it
is
a
nice
blend
of
both
the
taste
begins
roasted
and
dry
but
finishes
much
sweeter
the
roasted
dryness
lingers
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
roof
of
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
uneventful
overall
a
great
octoberfest
for
all
carbonation
seems
turned
up
a
bit
to
much
for
this
style
this
beer
tastes
much
different
than
i
remember
it
tasting
a
few
years
ago
i
may
have
had
a
old
beer
or
a
bad
6
pack
and
will
review
when
i
buy
it
again
next
year
as
every
beer
in
the
six
pack
had
the
same
off
taste
as
the
beer
warmed
thanks
to
jeffboo
for
this
treat
great
looking
beer
clean
looking
amber
looks
like
it
came
from
the
freshest
spring
in
the
world
the
nose
is
soft
but
exhibits
some
toasty
notes
the
taste
is
almost
bock
like
sweet
without
much
balance
from
the
hops
i
like
it
but
the
mouthfeel
definitely
leans
more
towards
a
bock
the
taste
is
mainly
toasted
malts
with
very
little
hopping
i
do
get
a
very
faint
floral
note
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
sweet
and
the
sweet
slick
feel
is
why
i
feel
this
leans
towards
bock
territory
this
was
my
most
anticipated
fest
tasting
yet
and
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
its
solid
id
drink
these
all
night
if
i
could
but
it
is
not
in
the
same
class
as
my
top
3
from
this
year
hackersummitcapital
it
is
in
that
next
level
though
worth
buying
a
sixer
of
if
you
see
it
solid
darkish
copper
color
with
a
small
puffy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
eventually
fading
to
nothing
as
its
consumed
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
that
dispear
fast
to
stick
in
webby
lines
and
spots
wonderful
toasted
aroma
on
this
touch
of
caramel
and
light
floral
dried
hops
very
crisply
toasted
with
a
hint
of
ripe
fruitylike
sweetness
reminescent
of
a
sour
bread
dough
really
becomes
a
sniffer
as
it
warms
taste
is
a
nice
toasty
lightly
sweet
mix
of
maltyness
very
solid
through
and
through
sweetness
is
strong
but
subdued
in
its
presense
over
an
amazing
and
great
little
toastyness
some
thinner
caramel
sits
in
the
back
with
some
light
herbalfloral
dried
hops
setting
up
the
finish
to
end
with
a
nice
mellow
crispness
and
light
lingering
sweetness
medium
body
feel
lightly
creamy
aspect
and
a
lovely
finish
a
very
nice
ofest
beer
that
goes
down
with
ease
a
new
favorite
to
keep
around
top
notch
and
a
cut
above
alot
of
the
mishmashy
ofest
brews
that
every
brewery
seems
to
make
this
one
is
done
right
great
job
new
glarus
toasty
staghorn
has
become
my
1
favorite
wisconsinproduced
oktoberfest
beer
acquired
via
trade
very
passable
marzen
deep
dark
amber
with
a
medium
beige
head
strong
malt
aroma
rich
malt
and
caramel
flavor
with
a
nicely
spiced
finish
this
is
one
of
the
better
new
glarus
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
on
a
side
note
i
have
really
liked
all
of
new
glarus
labels
very
cool
retro
art
this
is
my
favorite
american
oktoberfest
that
i
have
sampled
this
year
this
is
a
gorgeous
looking
beer
clear
deep
copper
with
orange
tinting
carbonation
is
evident
in
the
form
of
rapidly
surfacing
gas
bubbles
a
medium
sized
creamy
beige
head
sits
on
top
and
sticks
around
for
awhile
lacing
is
sufficient
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
this
beer
has
an
excellent
malt
profile
with
the
toasted
qualities
really
coming
to
the
forefront
a
nice
refined
sweetness
is
present
but
not
annoying
or
cloying
hops
are
present
to
produce
balance
and
thats
about
it
not
a
lot
of
contributions
to
the
taste
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
for
this
style
body
is
about
mediumfull
and
very
creamy
carbonated
to
perfection
after
trying
1520
ofests
this
year
id
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
on
the
top
shelf
as
far
as
midwestern
festbiers
go
poured
from
bottle
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
herbal
hop
and
spice
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
bubblegum
aroma
that
wont
fade
malty
toasted
overtones
with
hints
of
corn
and
herbs
finishes
bright
and
dry
o
not
all
that
bad
for
an
american
version
of
this
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
for
being
one
of
the
better
domestic
takes
what
are
they
missing
the
water
the
process
decoction
proprietary
yeast
freshness
of
ingredients
would
i
buy
it
again

above

with
a
good
bit

effervescence
in

on

the
flavor
profile
is
reasonably
intense
somewhat
complex
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
toasty

malt
then
flows
into
a
mild

sweetness
the

is
slightly
bitter
with

note
the
finish
is
a
bit
crisp
and
leaves
you
with
a
lingering
toasted
grainy
note
a
good
oktoberfest
o
ok
but
not
one
of
my
favs
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
a
purchase
of
a
sixer
nice
dark
amber
taste
with
slight
hop
definitely
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
fall
beers
a
little
more
unique
than
sam
adams
octoberfest
frist
slip
was
a
no
but
the
second
was
great
great
dark
tan
color
with
a
good
oktoberfest
taste
pick
this
beer
up
and
enjoy
good
taste
good
beer
i
liked
this
a
lot
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
very
good
i
could
drink
this
any
time
pours
a
deep
aged
copper
with
a
shortlasting
hear
ever
so
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
but
moderately
complex
with
nice
caramel
malt
a
little
fruit
and
a
bit
of
earth
unfortunately
once
the
head
burns
away
so
does
the
aroma
leaving
almost
nothing
the
taste
is
adequate
but
not
terribly
interesting
it
lacks
both
the
robust
malt
or
the
counterbalancing
hops
theres
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
but
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
somewhere
between
ok
and
good
ok
brew
definitely
my
least
favorite
of
all
of
the
flying
dog
brews
maybe
i
am
not
the
biggest
marzen
fan
but
here
goes
pours
dark
gold
beautifully
clear
head
is
good
and
lacing
is
nice
aroma
is
malty
and
so
is
the
taste
malt
sweetness
and
slightly
crisp
with
only
a
slight
aftertaste
solid
marzen
coppery
in
color
and
in
taste
even
no
odd
notes
medium
body
not
quite
sessiony
but
id
have
a
few
if
youre
buying
010213
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
good
solid
beer
balanced
thirst
quenching
a
tad
heavy
for
a
session
but
works
well
into
a
mix
o
lots
of
belgian
flavors
here
from
the
esters
to
the
ripe
bananas
but
on
all
on
a
nice
light
even
scale
actually
better
than
i
expected
in
a
style
i
can
take
or
leave
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
copper
red
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
some
fruitiness
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malt
but
with
a
watery
aftertaste
beer
is
very
carbonated
light
bodied
drinkable
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
a
good
option
for
an
oktoberfest
choice
very
medium
bodied
drinkable
and
with
a
pleasant
bready
kick
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
another
excellent
excellent
american
version
of
an
oktoberfeststyle
beer
beautifully
crafted
beautifully
balanced
beautifully
flavored
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
oktoberfest
beers
simply
delicious
serving
type
12
oz
bottle
a
reasonable
stab
at
a
märzen
though
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
an
authentic
german
brew
looks
ok
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
pleasant
in
a
fairly
nondescript
sort
of
way
mostly
malt
and
little
else
body
is
alright
i
reckon
bottle
conditioning
would
have
added
depth
drinkable
enough
but
hardly
outstanding
worth
sampling
though
no
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
the
light
and
toasty
body
makes
for
a
pleasant
oktoberfest
quaff
even
though
there
is
saurkraut
in
my
lederhosen
overall
not
a
bad
marzen
could
maybe
do
it
again
but
there
so
much
better
out
there
doesnt
hurt
to
try
it
at
least
once
salud
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
are
present
taste
is
malty
biscuits
some
sweetnessa
touch
of
caramel
at
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
served
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
at
the
pourhouse
westmont
nj
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
yes
its
pretty
good
but
this
is
not
true
to
the
style
the
bottle
clearly
says
ale
oktoberfests
are
lagers
points
taken
away
for
that
aside
from
me
being
so
picky
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
so
different
yet
so
good
this
one
was
a
hard
one
to
peg
because
it
has
some
aspects
of
the
beer
style
and
others
that
i
feel
are
out
of
place
try
for
yourself
and
see
flying
dog
dogtoberfest
pours
a
polished
amber
lightening
a
bit
around
the
edges
i
feel
as
though
clarity
could
be
just
a
little
bit
better
though
for
a
german
style
lager
maybe
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
head
crowns
the
beer
and
manages
to
stick
around
for
a
minute
or
two
lacing
is
a
bit
spotty
though
the
nose
has
some
nice
malt
aromas
though
i
think
it
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
less
caramel
and
more
breadbiscuit
character
the
flavor
profile
delivers
on
that
its
much
more
biscuity
with
just
a
little
bit
of
caramel
unfortunately
the
malt
aspect
passes
altogether
too
quickly
making
room
for
a
soft
bitterness
and
an
earthy
lightly
spicy
hoppy
finish
the
body
does
a
marvelous
job
of
staying
light
and
crisp
despite
the
malt
presence
in
the
beer
and
the
carbonation
adds
just
a
bit
of
life
to
the
beer
great
mouthfeel
all
around
its
not
quite
perfect
but
flying
dogs
rendition
of
a
marzen
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
them
that
ive
had
only
indication
of
bottling
date
is
a
stamp
of
362a12
on
the
bottom
of
the
label
o
caramel
heavy
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
lest
im
truly
in
the
mood
for
a
marzen
o
nice
marzen
not
bad
overall
good
beer
though
not
sure
it
necessarily
fits
in
well
as
an
oktomarzen
brew
its
certainly
not
your
standard
fare
for
the
style
in
the
very
least
its
an
enjoyable
beer
o
a
solid
example
of
the
style
thats
worth
trying
but
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
from
its
other
american
counterparts
overall
pretty
different
from
a
standard
marzen
the
sourness
that
i
seem
to
get
from
this
genre
is
more
of
a
tart
or
sweetness
in
this
one
not
a
very
exciting
or
repeatable
beer
d
a
nice
mal
character
and
enough
hops
to
keep
it
in
style
it
may
be
just
a
touch
too
sweet
but
it
is
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
wasnt
much
to
look
at
but
it
had
a
great
aroma
and
taste
solid
mouthfeel
too
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
toast
and
caramel
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
peer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
very
solid
marzen
tasting
the
beer
the
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
ale
rather
than
a
festbier
yet
the
roasted
malt
which
is
pretty
much
the
front
is
kept
in
check
by
some
earthy
hop
the
middle
is
of
a
strong
caramel
tofee
character
and
makes
this
beer
a
sweet
one
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
the
above
and
makes
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
brew
i
am
just
not
so
sure
of
the
style
but
i
guess
it
not
that
important
as
long
we
can
enjoy
it
overall
its
light
tasty
and
easy
drinking
good
for
an
oktoberfestival
but
not
so
much
the
oktobefest
beer
connoisseur
not
as
true
to
the
style
as
it
could
be
this
beer
has
a
fairly
strong
caramely
finish
certainly
too
sweet
for
the
style
this
is
probably
because
they
are
using
ale
yeasts
and
lower
attenuation
fermentations
poured
with
very
little
head
even
though
i
got
a
little
aggressive
at
the
end
as
i
saw
weak
head
formation
since
this
style
doesnt
mormally
pour
with
a
big
head
i
wasnt
too
concerned
first
couple
sips
were
pretty
good
but
the
overly
sweet
malt
characteristic
started
to
poke
through
as
the
temp
warmed
up
we
drank
this
beer
with
a
few
other
domestic
ofests
and
we
rated
it
last
lakefront
brooklyn
and
schlaflys
were
all
significantly
better
and
all
of
those
are
lagers
i
usually
like
flyingdogs
beers
except
for
the
ipas
but
this
is
one
i
cant
recommend
when
i
poured
thsi
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
nice
rich
amber
colored
body
to
it
with
no
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
the
taste
has
a
nice
rich
malt
flavor
and
as
it
warms
up
i
get
a
hint
of
roastyness
to
it
and
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
not
much
though
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
and
overall
a
good
ofestmarzen
beer
edit
im
liking
this
more
as
it
warms
up
the
malt
flavors
and
pretty
layered
and
complex
actually
still
not
what
i
want
in
an
octofest
though
othis
isnt
a
good
oktoberfest
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
it
might
be
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
something
i
want
to
be
drinking
all
night
the
feel
is
good
as
this
beer
is
appropriately
light
perhaps
medium
edging
that
way
which
a
uniform
smoothness
throughout
riding
off
a
steady
crispness
great
character
but
its
nothing
outstanding
in
overall
quality
just
a
fun
craft
take
ill
remember
to
turn
to
this
when
the
faithfuls
arent
cutting
it
or
are
boring
me
id
have
to
recommend
this
one
poured
a
dark
amber
reddish
color
small
tan
colored
head
smells
of
toasted
and
roasted
malts
taste
slightly
sweet
caramel
lots
of
malt
flavors
slight
bitterness
medium
body
overall
tasty
oktoberfest
beer
very
easy
to
drink
good
buy
if
fresh
and
local
o
this
ones
pretty
good
i
feel
its
not
the
easiest
chugger
which
is
vital
in
a
beer
like
this
but
it
features
enough
of
a
different
character
to
be
worthwhile
pours
out
a
clear
standard
amber
with
a
flash
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
behind
smells
of
floral
hopping
over
toasted
white
bread
and
caramel
tastes
more
of
very
light
herbal
and
grassy
hopping
under
a
standard
and
simple
caramel
and
vienna
malt
medium
body
and
carbonation
levels
this
one
is
decidedly
an
average
marzen
at
best
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
sweet
caramel
and
bready
up
front
a
splash
of
herbs
and
spice
taste
begins
with
a
sharp
astringent
note
mellows
into
a
bready
and
quite
sweet
beer
light
herbal
and
spice
on
the
end
medium
bodied
lightly
oily
in
texture
overall
a
little
sweet
and
off
when
compared
to
others
in
the
style
that
i
enjoy
overall
not
a
beer
to
get
excited
about
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
with
great
bottle
art
solid
not
must
have
o
this
is
a
märzen
a
bit
edgier
than
others
the
label
states
a
quote
from
hunter
s
thopmson
good
people
drink
good
beer
a
vigorous
pour
into
a
proper
mug
produces
a
prodigious
head
of
off
white
slightly
soapy
suds
with
good
retention
and
clumps
of
lace
on
the
sides
a
deep
rich
amber
and
visible
carbonation
trails
stir
the
imagination
of
crisp
malty
refreshment
the
nose
has
lots
of
malt
and
mild
caramel
sweetness
a
healthy
dose
of
roasted
grains
and
toasted
whole
grain
goodness
implies
more
than
a
few
malts
in
the
mix
some
hop
aromatics
give
an
herbal
sharpness
a
faint
note
of
butterscotch
taste
is
solid
quite
malty
with
facets
of
butterscotch

caramelish
toffee
some
toasted

american
finish
that

crisp
dry
and
clean
toast

malt
lingering
lightly
with
a
mildly
peppery
hops
signature
feel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
spot
on
carbonation
for
the
style
making
this
highly
drinkable
overall
a
solid
take
on
a
popular
style
worth
your
money
and
time
oanother
run
of
the
mill
oktoberfest
really
nothing
that
stands
out
here
overall
a
very
impressive
brew
for
this
style
a
perfect
blending
of
flavors
with
a
nice
mild

a
tired
best
before
04
07
12
and
somewhat
oxidized
beer
im
not
impressed
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
fairly
forgettable
except
the
label
the
beer
exits
the
yellowlabeled
bottle
a
stately
dark
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
foam
above
it
the
foam
left
a
vestige
of
lacing
down
the
glass
a
nice
looking
brew
the
aroma
is
swimming
in
deep
malt
some
husk
mixes
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
richly
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
the
sweet
grain
sloshes
around
the
palate
leaving
much
to
be
enjoyed
the
dash
of
bitterness
at
the
end
goes
a
long
ways
toward
balancing
the
beer
overall
a
nicely
traditional
rendition
of
the
style
overall
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
beer
really
hearty
beer
for
the
season
and
style
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
very
thin
head
it
has
a
bready
nose
with
distinct
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
but
it
lacks
the
hearty
malt
flavor
of
the
style
this
offering
had
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
but
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
left
me
wanting
for
something
with
a
bigger
punch
this
isnt
my
favorite
oktoberfest
and
its
likely
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
would
i
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
probably
not
pours
a
clear
mahogany
body
a
tan
head
of
rich
foam
that
lasts
a
long
time
smells
primarily
toasty
with
a
bit
of
rotting
leaves
and
cardboard
dust
thrown
in
the
mix
vienna
malts
dominate
the
flavor
profile
toastiness
galore
and
some
toffee
or
caramellike
sweetness
with
a
hop
profile
that
is
similar
to
the
best
german
oktoberfests
ive
tried
earthy
and
a
bit
tealike
even
herbaceous
as
it
warms
the
body
feels
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
from
this
style
but
overall
this
is
really
wellmade
and
an
excellent
value
especially
in
comparison
to
the
german
ofests
also
of
note
the
abv
seems
to
have
been
increased
since
this
beer
was
first
listed
it
is
listed
as
5
6
on
the
bottle
this
year
o
a
very
good
choice
for
the
style
as
a
baseline
of
what
ofest
should
taste
like
id
certainly
take
this
anytime
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
a
little
sweet
overall
a
pretty
good
version
of
a
marzen
from
flying
dog
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
kind
of
a
lackluster
beer
for
me
not
my
favorite
style
but
even
with
that
said
still
just
not
anything
to
write
home
about
surprisingly
not
bad
compared
to
other
octoberfests
ive
had
this
one
did
actually
shine
still
not
as
good
as
sam
though
pour
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
retaining
cream
colored
head
and
a
little
bit
of
a
breads
scent
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
taste
and
a
hint
of
raisins
and
grapes
needs
a
little
bit
of
a
balance
to
the
sweetness
but
im
glad
to
of
found
another
american
octoberfest
i
liked
d
good
ofest
offering
from
flying
dog
decent
complexity
between
sweet
malts
and
very
light
roasted
aspects
it
is
easy
drinking
but
not
something
ill
run
back
for
o
great
marzen
with
some
beautiful
flavors
that
mix
well
d
the
drinkablilty
is
fairly
good
probably
not
an
oktoberfest
that
ill
seek
out
but
not
bad
very
strange
this
is
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
this
is
just
too
harsh
to
be
pleasantly
drinkable
needs
some
more
sweetness
to
balance
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
copper
orange
in
color
with
yellow
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
a
bit
hazy
poured
with
a
soapy
off
white
foam
that
rdeuced
to
a
thick
cap
toasted
bready
grain
aromas

and
with

light
herbal
hop
aroma

middle
to
the
finish
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
lingering
light

hoppiness
more
hop
character
than
most
marzens
ive
tried
the
rest
meh
an
ok
marzen
with
some
weirdness
on
the
back
end
that
ruins
it
for
me
o
decent
beer
but
not
very
complex
a
tad
too
thick
for
this
style
for
my
liking
a
good
malty
dog
possible
a
bit
sweet
id
say
this
has
the
weakest
taste
profile
of
the
three
its
light
and
watery
at
first
with
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
itd
be
easy
to
slam
down
a
few
if
you
didnt
get
bored
along
the
way
its
just
an
average
brew
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
label
and
quote
by
hunter
s
thompson
stating
good
people
drink
good
beer
pour
a
nice
copper
reddish
hue
with
average
lacing
and
carbonation
some
roasted
malt
backbone
and
with
a
little
lemon
zest
medium
body
but
missing
some
toasty
sweetness
while
oktoberfests
are
not
my
favorite
beer
i
know
a
good
one
when
i
have
one
and
this
is
a
very
well
brewed
example
of
the
style
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
try
it
overall
i
could
enjoy
this
no
problem
its
not
a
favorite
but
sure
isnt
hard
to
swallow
either
i
would
prefer
more
malt
than
the
hop
bent
on
this
for
the
style
but
thats
just
me
cheers
overall
actually
one
of
the
better
marzens
ive
had
good
taste
pleasant
mouthfeel
good
job
by
flying
dog
overall
not
too
bad
for
an
american
oktoberfest
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
cooler
nights
that
are
starting
to
creep
in
here
in
the
north
east
and
the
recent
freaking
earthquake
and
upcoming
hurricane
the
5
6
abv
is
respectable
cheers
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
offering
from
flying
dog
i
may
have
mentioned
i
work
right
down
the
road
from
flying
dogs
brewery
in
frederick
so
yeah
im
a
little
partial
this
is
a
great
beer
regardless
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
light
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
tan
color
heads
on
top
the
head
doesnt
give
off
much
lacing
here
but
the
aroma
had
plenty
of
autumn
spice
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
malty
and
slightly
sweet
upfront
then
it
fades
into
a
warming
spice
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
think
its
carbonated
well
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
oktoberfest
in
my
opinion
o
this
was
the
first
octoberfest
i
had
this
year
i
was
fairly
impressed
by
it
it
is
definetly
a
beer
i
can
recommend
to
friends
it
is
not
hard
to
drink
either
so
i
could
drink
more
then
one
if
tempted
too
flying
dog
has
a
great
line
of
beers
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
good
people
drink
good
beer
no
head
on
this
beer
has
a
rusty
color
with
slight
lacing
even
with
the
low
abv
on
this
beer
it
still
somehow
leaves
a
strong
alcohol
taste
on
your
tongue
the
one
thing
i
did
like
about
this
beer
was
how
easy
it
goes
down
the
ole
hatch
overall
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
and
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
just
based
on
personal
prefferance
overall
an
ok
beer
i
suppose
not
one
of
the
better
marzens
that
ive
tried
however
whoever
flying
dog
claims
learned
how
to
make
this
style
while
in
german
needs
to
go
back
for
a
remedial
course
nice
sweetnessbitterness
balance
it
is
a
very
unidimensional
but

subsided

a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent

throughout
the

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

spices
and
lemon

the
flavor
was
of
sweet

lemon

nutmeg
and
slight

it
had
a

not
my
favorite
of
the
style
at
all
the
lemon
zest
was
a
nice
addition
to
this
one
though
with
it
being
aged
for
so
long
this
one
really
wasnt
that
bad
if
im
honest
worth
trying
once
but
that
is
about
it
coppery
amber
with
a
creamy
blonde
head
that
leaves
little
blobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hoppiness
sweet
biscuit
malt
with
a
touch
of
citric
hop
notes
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
smooth
lush
carbonation
a
decent
brew
from
flying
dog
o
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
but
a
solid
brew
taste
has
a
strong
malt
backbone
more
spiciness
than
the
usual
oktoberfest
beer
carbonation
is
right
on
the
breadiness
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
high
the
hop
presence
seems
a
bit
stale
pretty
octoberfest
beer
deep
amber
color
almost
brown
smell
is
the
most
striking
part
of
this
beer
and
it
seems
as
if
a
lot
of
time
was
taken
in
this
part
of
the
beer
sweetness
almost
cloyingly
so
and
caramel
are
abundant
in
the
aroma
they
go
together
well
and
create
an
excellent
entrance
for
a
taste
that
is
similar
its
sweet
at
first
followed
by
a
caramel
that
is
almost
too
much
and
takes
a
little
away
from
the
overall
experience
finishes
dry
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
but
caramelly
and
sweet
all
the
way
including
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
isnt
perfect
and
feels
a
little
too
carbonated
drinkability
is
cut
a
little
short
by
the
sweetness
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
beer
had
a
caramel
malt
aroma
some
barley
and
a
mix
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
it
had
a
slightly
dark
amberorange
color
which
was
mostly
clearer
with
an
averagesized
foamy
white
head
the
flavor
was
mostly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
average
wetness
and
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
full
mouthfeel
drinkability
enough
interest
to
keep
sipping
not
enough
to
seek
it
out
again
the
aroma
is
very
malty
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
iced
tea
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
grassyness
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
lots
of
toffee
caramel
and
grass
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
it
was
damn
good
i
like
that
it
has
all
the
stereotypical
flavors
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
but
it
had
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
d
party
in
a
glass
a
damn
fine
version
not
overly
complex
but
very
robust
with
a
great
depth
to
its
malty
richness
great
balance
in
a
rich
and
hefty
way
a
rather
beefy
but
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
some
yeast
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
malty
caramel
some
breadiness
overall
a
descent
drinkable
and
sessionable
octoberfest
the
beer
pours
a
copper
amber
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
interesting
the
aroma
smells
noble
and
yet
fruity
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
of
biscuits
or
bread
at
first
turning
more
into
a
caramel
taste
i
dont
notice
the
hops
at
all
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
light
feel
and
i
would
say
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
d
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
glad
to
try
it
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
d
quite
drinkable
in
that
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
and
it
goes
down
easy
but
im
reaching
for
something
better
after
one
of
these
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
color
is
a
rusty
amber
with
a
good
head
and
nice
ringy
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
caramel
toast
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
mostly
malt
without
too
much
depth
good
medium
body
a
nice
fall
beer
i
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
a
real
authentic
tasting
marzen
from
one
of
the
bigger
us
breweries
is
a
very
welcome
thing
cheap
8
a
6
pack
here
and
a
superb
buy
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
next
year
easy
drinkable
a
solid
octoberfest
and
very
underated
i
found
this
beer
to
be
more
in
line
with
traditional
marzens
than
an
american
interpretation
wish
i
could
find
more
of
it
drink
i
think
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
war
in
this
bottle
being
waged
between
hops
and
the
malt
i
think
thats
where
the
taste
comes
from
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
malt
as
a
kid
and
that
seems
to
be
where
i
am
coming
back
too
i
could
probably
do
2
or
3
in
a
session
of
these
not
too
shabby
flying
dog
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
decent
balance
to
it
and
decently
sweet
dry
balance
overall
its
not
for
some
reason
mind
blowing
but
its
certainly
and
inoffensive
example
of
the
style
a
bit
to
heavy
and
dull
for
me
to
i
think
sitting
around
drinking
it
all
nite
long
but
not
bad
example
of
the
marzen
style
which
to
be
fair
i
think
at
this
point
of
the
year
im
now
finally
burnt
out
on
a
bit
so
maybe
give
this
one
another
look
in
beginning
of
next
season
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
overall
this
is
more
of
your
hops
vs
malt
type
of
octoberfest
which
is
rare
to
be
seen
yet
flying
dog
is
able
to
pull
it
off
with
a
good
amount
of
balance
between
the
two
the
earthy
hop
notes
balance
nicely
into
the
malty
backbone
making
this
a
smooth
refreshing
yet
drinkable
beer
at
5
3
abv
its
a
good
session
beer
and
can
be
easily
drank
in
quantity
id
be
more
than
happy
to
sit
on
the
patio
on
a
cool
fall
night
and
drink
this
one
overall
i
really
like
flying
dog
beers
but
this
one
i
cant
stand
my
first
disappointing
flying
dog
beer
is
this
d
flying
dog
continues
to
impress
me
and
this
is
a
great
rep
of
the
style
will
have
it
again
overall
the
darkest
strongest
tasting
oktoberfest
i
have
had
yet
and
also
one
of
the
most
alcoholic
its
not
a
drink
all
night
sort
of
beer
but
its
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkability
nice
complexity
and
good
taste
albeit
slightly
more
bitter
than
id
normally
like
nice
brew
clean
and
clear
aroma
with
hints
of
nuts
floral
and
somewhat
buttery
appearance
is
a
nice
clear
amber
with
minimal
head
a
slightly
bitter
taste
with
medium
sweet
undertones
and
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
body
is
medium
and
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
atypical
marzen
done
well
tastebig
dose
of
sweettoasted
malt
caramel
and
a
subtle
herbal
hop
bite
that
keeps
things
from
getting
to
cloying
flying
dog
dogtoberfest
is
a
nice
little
surprise
for
a
brewery
better
known
for
their
ales
this
is
a
very
solid
octoberfest
beer
its
a
clear
polish
bronze
with
eggshell
foam
the
smell
and
taste
is
rich
bready
malty
and
herbal
hops
that
complement
each
other
well
unlike
other
marzens
that
can
be
either
too
thin
or
overly
malty
this
is
a
very
nice
balance
and
just
sweet
enough
carbonation
is
good
and
the
beer
has
a
nice
aftertaste
a
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
but
after
this
one
not
really
sure
i
would
might
have
to
try
again
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
bottle
with
better
carbonation
taste
is
ok
and
it
being
light
bodied
i
could
easily
have
34
i
have
had
much
better
oktoberfest
beers
however
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
notes
this
is
one
of
the
better
dark
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
had
this
year
i
can
see
this
pairing
very
well
with
traditional
oktoberfest
food
i
know
i
am
craving
a
big
pretzel
with
mustard
right
now
fairly
decent
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
i
would
probably
grab
another
if
offered
drinkability
a
farily
average
ofest
but
still
good
overall
and
worth
a
drink
d
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
an
american
style
marzen
nice
flavor
and
very
drinkable
smooth
refreshing
and
uncommonly
drinkable
spot
on
for
a
marzen
full
bodied
rich
and
toasty
prost
one
of
the
few
beers
i
like
to
try
out
of
the
bottle
this
time
of
year
immediately
poured
with
a
nice
head
but
it
unfortunately
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
lace
pretty
light
with
the
mouth
feel
biggest
disappointment
was
an
average
finish
not
a
good
this
year
as
in
past
but
better
than
most
due
to
being
at
a
guests
house
i
drank
this
from
the
bottle
not
as
hearty
as
other
marzens
ive
tried
but
very
drinkable
not
harsh
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
zing
read
flavor
good
for
drinking
with
food
but
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
for
my
tastebuds
sampled
on
september
25
2010
the
pour
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
decent
clarity
and
in
the
tall
glass
a
good
four
inch
head
that
slowly
diminishes
malts
greet
the
nose
on
the
first
whiff
with
both
bitter
and
sweet
sensations
the
taste
tended
to
be
on
the
yeasty
side
with
a
pleasing
bitter
maltiness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
this
was
very
drinkable
and
had
some
nice
character
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
while
it
might
not
be
to
a
tee
the
style
guidelines
it
is
very
very
tasty
worth
checking
out
for
sure
d
good
stuff
easy
to
drink
a
flavorful
moderate
session
brew
for
the
fall
months
ill
most
likely
have
this
again
d
nothing
special
here
its
not
hard
to
drink
though
and
it
tastes
fine
drinkability
is
up
only
due
to
the
low
abv
i
love
octoberfest
beers
and
i
love
flying
dog
i
think
they
are
one
of
the
best
micros
around
their
version
of
the
octoberfest
is
not
anything
impressive
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
you
may
drink
one
and
not
like
it
but
give
it
a
second
try
it
has
a
great
taste
and
has
great
drinkability
for
those
fall
football
days
had
a
bottle
for
3
50
at
liberty
st
tavern
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
a
while
but
wasnt
terribly
impressed
while
most
ofest
are
wonderfully
balanced
i
found
the
sweetness
to
border
on
cloying
i
wouldnt
order
another
this
beer
needs
to
be
dried
out
there
was
a
fruity
caramel
taste
that
was
just
over
the
top
in
what
would
have
otherwise
been
a
decent
beer
d
hits
midrange
for
the
style
not
really
one
to
go
looking
for
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
that
leaves
a
beige
ring
smell
is
kinda
stale
with
malts
and
biscuitstaste
is
better
is
lots
of
malts
some
sweet
caramel
mixed
with
spices
like
nutmeg
cinnamon
vienna
malts
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
and
an
earthy
taste
not
my
favorite
4
the
style
and
will
be
a
one
and
done
4
me
its
just
average
drinkable
with
an
average
taste
i
will
say
to
try
however
pours
a
beuatiful
amber
with
a
big
foamyfluffy
head
which
slowly
recedes
to
what
looks
like
congealed
butter
quite
a
different
look
smells
strongly
of
brown
sugarcaramel
pumpkin
spice
and
yeast
with
matching
taste
profile
i
find
it
quite
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
carbonation
on
a
medium
bodied
beer
this
beer
gets
tastier
as
its
temperature
climbs
perhaps
the
seasonal
spice
of
these
beers
tend
to
get
lost
in
a
sort
of
mud
on
the
toungue
but
in
this
case
whatever
distinctive
taste
flying
dog
may
have
been
looking
for
did
come
through
in
this
brew
overall
it
is
middle
of
the
road
probably
lacks
a
bit
too
much
punch
to
be
a
second
return
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
ample
carbonation
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
overall
this
was
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
lack
of
head
poor
expression
in
the
nose
and
few
offflavors
kept
this
one
from
scoring
higher
however
its
not
bad
for
a
marzenoctoberfest
and
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
tailgating
or
enjoying
the
brisk
autumn
weather
overall
maybe
a
bit
better
than
average
marzen
but
nothing
spectacular
maybe
a
bit
too
much
bitter
earthy
lemon
hop
for
my
taste
but
thats
splitting
hairs
i
can
tell
that
it
would
be
a
really
drinkable
beer
but
with
the
low
carbonation
it
kind
of
detracts
from
it
d
3
the
big
caramel
i
missed
in
sa
from
years
back
is
here
in
spades
this
and
hacker
were
my
favorites
of
the
season
after
a
bottle
or
two
of
each
the
syrupy
quality
of
this
beer
though
and
a
slight
yeasty
off
flavor
of
some
sort
wear
on
me
until
i
cant
stand
it
anymore
little
surprised
with
this
one
d
the
first
one
tastes
nice
but
im
not
sure
how
many
i
would
want
the
mouthfeel
is
really
what
kills
this
beer
in
my
mind
paired
very
well
with
my
expensive
and
elite
kraft
mac
n
cheese
out
of
the
bottle
pours
an
orange
copper
clear
brew
with
a
good
foamy
head
toasted
malt
abound
caramel
for
sure
and
a
touch
of
grapeor
something
reminiscent
of
white
wine
feels
smooth
with
a
medium
wellbalanced
body
crisp
and
well
carbonated
the
toasted
character
of
the
malt
is
most
distinctive
but
it
leaves
room
for
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
a
touch
of
bitter
wheat
a
little
simplistic
but
a
wellcrafted
beer
with
enough
body
to
stay
interesting
and
very
drinkable
d
a
relatively
good
beer
from
flying
dog
and
one
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
a
few
of
small
carbonation
very
sodaesque
not
digging
it
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
particularly
want
to
i
had
a
fresh
batch
of
this
brew
and
i
liked
it
very
much
this
was
also
at
a
5
6
abv
drinkability
has
the
style
of
the
märzen
down
right
without
trying
to
imitate
to
the
point
of
overembellishing
the
harvest
characteristics
very
enjoyable
nice
for
the
style
would
have
again
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
has
a
very
strong
malt
smell
and
flavor
it
was
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
there
was
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
at
the
end
it
had
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
one
i
would
drink
again
if
they
were
to
make
it
again

from

staying
true

style
goes
a
long
way
d
filling
and
a
long
lingering
taste
was
always
a
little
turned
off
of
flying
dog
because
of
artwork
and
labels
and
ideas

they
can
really
brew
md
very

bodied

very
smooth

can
taste
some

it
goes
away
rather

really

it

local
mgm
it
was
only
a
single
but
im
glad
i
grabbed
it
anyway
will
look
for
it
next
fall
a
great
brew
to
try
and
share
too
big
and
rich
for
an
oktoberfestmarzen
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
sessionable
style
however
i
havent
marked
it
down
too
much
as
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
id
take
this
over
the
6
helles
lagers
that
call
themselves
oktoberfests
d
this
is
more
of
a
summer
beer
than
an
oktoberfest
doesnt
really
hold
up
to
many
of
the
expectations
of
the

this

those
who
dont
like

quarter
inch
high
the
head
dissolves
away
slowly
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
a
bread
and
biscuit
fragrance
comes
out
at
the
front
with
touches
of
pine
grass
and
earth
that
stays
with
the
nose
for
awhile
the
malt
comes
out
at
the
front
of
each
taste
with
the
bread
flavor
a
touch
caramel
as
well
then
a
mild
bitterness
comes
in
halfway
with
grass
and
grapefruit
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
a
strong
octoberfest
bringing
that
beautiful
color
the
bemalty
but
biting
aroma
then
add
the
classic
flavor
and
feel
you
have
an
excellent
fall
beer
the
body
is
medium
and
has
some
nice
sizzle
from
the
carbonation
not
stellar
but
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
finish
is
sweet
has
a
nice
caramel
note
to
it
but
i
find
myself
yawning
after
14
of
it
i
say
pass
there
are
better
versions
of
this
style
a
smooth
full
beer
with
lots
of
malt
character
plenty
of
bitterness
playing
in
here
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
simply
due
to
the
way
it
all
fits
together
not
bad
notes
not
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
but
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
it
is
just
a
little
different
in
ways
that
i
would
rather
it
stay
similar
to
other
ofests
a
nice
amber
color
pour
with
a
small
sized
off
white
head
that
had
a
good
hangtime
then
faded
to
leave
a
slight
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
and
possibly
some
faint
hops
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
was
much
better
then
i
thought
it
might
be
nice
malty
side
that
comes
off
as
being
mildly
sweet
at
times
with
a
shade
of
caramel
and
a
decent
hop
presence
coming
on
towards
the
end
medium
body
with
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
quite
sessionable
and
a
pretty
good
offering
drinkability
not
my
sort
of
oktoberfest
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
the
sweetness
is
slightly
sickly
and
hinders
the
drinkability
a
bit
pours
a
dark
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
and
has
an
undertone
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
yeast
flavor
is
richly
malty
a
little
hoppy
slightly
yeasty
slightly
bitter
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
fizzy
d
not
a
horrible
beer
not
undrinkable
just
a
bit
average
this
beer
poured
out
a
clean
and
crisp
caramel
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
had
the
distinct
lager
smell
mixed
in
with
hints
of
caramel
and
sweet
syrup
the
taste
came
in
with
a
nice
toasty
malt
profile
and
a
bit
of
sulfurylagery
taste
followed
up
by
a
pleasent
caramely
sweetnes
the
beer
finished
a
little
warm
with
delicate
toastybiscut
malts
haning
on
the
tongue
it
is
no
wonder
this
beer
has
won
itself
a
gold
for
the
last
two
years
at
gabf
great
example
of
the
style
overall
a
decent
marzen
a
bit
too
spicy
for
my
tastes
im
glad
we
are
almost
through
with
the
fall
seasonals
i
think
im
about
done
with
this
style
for
a
bit
m
a
little
flat
but
it
doesnt
ruin
my
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
t
nice
europeanstyle
oktoberfest
it
has
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
and
a
beautiful
crispness
as
well
excellent
oktoberfest
this
is
one
of
the
darkest
looking
oktoberfests
i
have
seen
even
for
american
versions
it
is
much
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
and
oktoberfest
its
got
great
weight
and
full
flavored
but
its
not
an
oktoberfest
so
i
have
to
rate
it
accordingly
i
would
maybe
go
half
a
point
higher
on
each
criteria
if
it
werent
labeled
oktoberfest
overall
though
a
good
brew
but
i
wouldnt
reccommend
if
your
looking
for
a
traditional
oktoberfest
dquite
drinkable
easily
deserving
of
sessionable
fest
status
a
decent
little
ofest
here
if
not
a
bit
too
sticky
sweet
in
the
taste
and
feel
at
times
i
didnt
have
much
of
a
problem
finishing
the
bottle
off
but
im
not
so
sure
if
i
would
want
to
go
to
this
again
and
again
though
overall
a
nice
fest
well
worth
seeking
out
snappy
crisp
malty
body
with
a
slightly
dry
almost
sour
twang
to
the
finish
hints
of
pumpkin
pulp
and
graham
cracker
thrown
in
the
mix
as
well
while
the
hops
add
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
to
the
backside
of
the
palate
great
carbonation
level
while
the
mediumthin
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
smooth
refreshing
sip
wow
who
wouldve
thought
the
first
oktoberfest
to
truly
impress
me
and
ive
tried
half
a
dozen
or
so
would
be
from
flying
dog
not
i
but
im
glad
it
is
so
id
had
always
thought
that
i
enjoyed
the
spaten
ofest
the
most
out
of
the
category
but
this
beer
really
took
me
for
a
ride
and
made
me
wonder
about
that
as
opposed
to
the
malty
sweetness
and
faint
hopiness
that
accompanies
so
many
other
october
beers
this
one
brings
to
the
table
a
great
complexity
there
is
some
grape
musk
yeastiness
in
the
nose
and
bitterness
and
ale
like
fruitiness
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
thick
but
leaving
you
wanting
another
drink
its
dryer
than
the
style
usually
is
but
that
works
really
well
for
this
beer
and
the
beer
on
the
whole
is
one
that
is
as
easily
swilled
out
of
a
stein
or
sipped
from
a
pint
while
analyzing
its
finer
qualities
delicious
despite
the
final
score
this
is
actually
a
good
pick
for
the
season
dogtoberfest
sets
the
bar
for
the
other
three
beers
here
in
the
american
oktoberfest
invitational
which
will
resume
tonmorrow
with
another

this

i
prefer
the
more
standard
ofests
but
this
was
an
interesting
twist
i
do
like
to
have
some
sweeter

like
this

its
a
natural
in
my
typical
spicysweet
chicken

d

does

d
very

perfect
to

with

case
of
this
cheers
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
love
it
id
like
to
have
it
again
because
it
has
some
neat
things
going
for
it
but
doesnt
really
pull
the
whole
package
together
for
me
probably
one
of
the
worst
flying
dog
products
i
have
had
way
too
sweet
and
just
pretty
unremarkable
overall
also
heavy
on
the
earthy
notes
which
i
dont
like
in
octoberfest
beers
at
all
not
really
worth
the
time
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
in
my
oktoberfest
tasting
i
still
think
i
liked
victorys
festbier
a
little
bit
better
but
this
is
a
close
second
again
at
first
this
is
nothing
impressivebut
it
warms
up
as
time
goes
on
just
as
a
nice
marzen
should
unfortunately
i
got
a
slight
metallic
taste
that
would
not
go
away
d
as
with
most
fest
beers
this
one
is
made
for
going
down
real
easy
d
good
american
oktoberfest
beer
with
a
twist
of
caramel
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
it
is
a
tad
bit
sweet
for
me
with
the
large
caramel
presence
the
brew
is
good
i
just
dont
get
the
oktoberfest
vibe
from
it
that
i
would
expect
good
for
a
change
up
brew
for
this
style
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
to
celebrate
fall
with
tasty
and
attractive
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
slightly
tan
fluffy
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
like
a
sharp
dark
honey
sweet
but
with
a
malt
sting
the
flavor
is
bready
and
toasted
with
a
sharp
bitterness
that
manifests
high
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
bit
of
floral
hop
character
but
the
star
if
the
show
is
the
spicy
malt
burn
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
has
a
sharp
carbonation
that
stings
the
tongue
bottled
poured
into
tulip
great
looking
ruby
brownish
color
aroma
is
malty
up

but
i
detect
some
hops

up

hoppy
finish
not
a
lot
per
se
but
for
an
octoberfest
a
bit
much
decent
body
great
carb
a
little
creamy
again
hoppiness
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
octoberfest
detracts
from
drinkability
of
your
traditional
octoberfest
a
nice
light
octoberfestmarzen
beer
might
get
swamped
by
highly
spiced
foods
but
would
compliment
more
mellow
dishes
quite
nicely
all
in
all
not
the
best
domestic
octoberfest
ive
tasted
but
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
simple
and
straightforward
ofest
here
a
bit
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
me
but
tasty
enough
d
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
d
high
this
brew
could
convert
some
macro
drinkers
imo
dogtoberfest
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
d
high
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
balanced
a
pleasant
drink
with
5
3
abv
d
definitely
an
american
version
of
marzen
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
in
an
evening
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
touch
of
red
two
finger
white
head
fades
to
a
thin
cap

for
the

so

was

german
ofests

alongside
a
hacker
pschorr
close
but
not
quite
there
my
favorite
flying
dog
beer
to
date
typically
i
feel
like
flying
dog
attempts
to
go
for
over
the
top
bold
tastes
and
fails
but
in
this
case
the
strong
and
solid
flavor
of
the
dogtoberfest
was
pretty
good
this
is
an
excellent
oktoberfestmarzen
the
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
coloron
the
darker
side
the
aroma
is
very
dry
and
cereally
malt
nose
toasty
cheerios
malt
is
the
predominant
aroma
the
taste
is
crisp
but

wonderful

heavy
despite
all
the
malt

good
marzen
and
an
enjoyable

clear
almost

finishes
very
clean
drinkability
not
so
high
but
i
can
enjoy
3
or
4
of
these
d
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
judge
on
its
own
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
to
me
it
missed
the
mark
in
the
style
department
by
a
mile
so
what
we
have
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
märzen
should
to
me
i
guess
ill
have
to
split
the
difference
on
this
one
d
this
is
decent
but
the
malt
and
hops
are
both
a
little
too
onedimensional
the
malt
is
somewhat
flat
and
sweet
while
the
hops
add
a
blunt
bitterness
given
the
malt
profile
without
much
of
a
defining
flavor
a
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
many
other
american
marzens
also
after
tasting
a
glass
i
then
drank
it
with
roasted
chicken
their
website
suggested
roasted
poultry
baby
portabella
mushrooms
and
tomatos
it
was
a
great
pairing
and
highly
recommended
it
brought
out
the
maltiness
and
more
of
the
spice
of
the
beer
more
malty
than
some
of
the
other
okts
ive
had
but
im
not
complaining
i
like
it
this
way
drinkability
nice
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
certainly
a
german
lager
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
a
marzen
almost
more
like
a
lower
bitterness
vienna
or
a
lower
abv
bock
i
am
not
too
much
of
a
stickler
for
style
so
i
like
it
final
thoughts
another
interesting
oktoberfest
marzen
nice
toasted
malts
slight
malt
spice
flavor
crisp
lager
taste
the
only
real
bad
taste
is
that
syrupy
extract
flavor
i
seem
to
find
that
flavor
in
most
american
marzenoktoberfestautumnfest
type
beers
perhaps
its
a
product
of
the
yeast
or
perhaps
we
just
dont
get
the
best
malts
here
as
they
do
in
germany
this
really
makes
me
crave
an
ayinger
oktoberfest
i
cant
wait
until
that
hits
the
shelves
overall
this
is
a
good
americanmade
fest
bier
that
does
the
style
proud
i
recommend
this
bier
pick
up
a
few
of
these
for
you
and
the
boys
prosit
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
flavors
are
sweet
and
full
with
a
dry
finish
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
and
easily
drinkable
a
solid
marzen
that
went
well
with
my
brats
tonight
d
could
drink
a
few
a
good
complement
to
psychology
reading
d
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
4
easily
rotation
one
and
done
as
better
ones
out
there
not
even
sure
if
this
would
make
the
cut
if
down
to
this
or
usual
swill
at
store
or
ontap
definitely
a
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
this
style
is
obviously
meant
to
be
drunk
in
liters
and
this
beer
is
right
in
line
with
that
overall
i
had
to
try
this
one
out
of
a
mixed
6
pack
i
got
the
other
day
of
all
oktoberfest
brews
the
lady
at
the
store
whos
michigans
first
woman
cicerone
knows
her
stuff
and
said
this
one
isnt
to
shabby
and
shes
right
the
only
thing
im
curious
is
she
said
the
great
lakes
one
isnt
to
impressive
and
im
a
fan
of
the
lakes
i
shall
find
out
tomorrow
must
note
this
is
prolly
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
flying
dog
their
gonzo
porter
isnt
to
shabby
also
pours
transparent
amber
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
good
lacing
smell
is
faint
but
has
slight
hop
scent
the
taste
is
well
balanced
but
just
not
very
strong
i
guess
thats
pretty
much
the
style
as
ive
never
really
found
an
extreme
flavored
octoberfest
this
example
is
nicely
drinkable
just
not
a
wower
its
october
again
time
to
drink
a
lot
of
great
oktoberfest
beers
this
beer
was
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
brown
to
copper
hue
slightly
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
carbonation
was
weak
and
steady
started
out
with
a
thick
head
that
fell
away
quickly
beer
is
clear
very
very
clear
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
i
can
smell
some
malt
but
not
much
no
hop
character
at
all
the
taste
is
good
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
but
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
i
think
im
coming
around
on
flying
dog
brews
more
than
i
was
before
after
drinking
two
of
these
beers
there
is
a
growing
unpleasant
aftertaste
but
it
fades
quickly
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
for
a
5
3
abv
beverage
perfect
for
the
fall
i
would
find
this
less
sessionable
in
the
summer
and
winter
definitely
would
purchase
again
an
okay
marzen
but
nothing
spectacular
there
are
other
beers
of
the
same
style
i
would
prefer
dnot
being
a
session
drinker
i
could
still
have
a
few
of
these
no
problem
would
like
to
find
this
on
tap
sometime
poured
copperbrown
into
an
american
pint
glass
the
head
was
white
and
full
at
first
but
deflated
immediately
the
smell
was
caramel
toffee
biscuit
and
honey
with
a
slight
hopbitter
presence
the
taste
was
not
as
pronounced
as
the
nose
and
the
mouth
was
dare
i
say
too
light
for
a
maerzen
that
being
said
you
could
probably
slam
down
a
handful
of
these
d
overall
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
but
there
are
many
better
ones
outthere
that
would
keep
me
from
purchasing
again
d
a
decent
offering
from
flying
dog
its
not
as
good
as
spaten
or
great
lakes
but
a
good
attempt
in
a
nutshell
i
would
refer
to
this
beer
as
a
poor
american
substitute
for
real
marzen
oktoberfest
pours
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
tight
offwhite
head
that
disipated
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
a
toasted
bready
malt
some
caramel
and
nut
the
taste
is
of
a
toasted
malt
some
earthy
resin
hop
flavor
a
bit
nutty
with
a
light
honeycaramel
sweetness
the
feel
is
of
a
solid
malt
body
almost
chewy
tingly
carbonation
finishes
with
a
light
earthy
bitterness
a
nice
malty
marzen
with
a
noticable
hop
presence
perhaps
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
marzen
is
this
the
best
i
have
had
no
but
it
is
solid
dark
yellow
light
amber
color
with
a
medium
body
head
into
a
4
oz
tasting
glass
a
nice
spring
water
and
floral
scent
with
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
medium
bodied
for
a
marzen
but
crisp
on
the
back
end
with
good
carbonation
and
a
mild
abv
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bit
light
but
otherwise
drinkable
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
was
of
malt
caramel
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
was
very
rich
it
was
of
malt
and
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
with
some
bread
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
carbonated
the
overall
drinkability
is
above
average
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
flavorful
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
foam
aroma
and
flavor
are
of
sweet
malt
apples
slightly
metallic
grassy
bitter
hops
fruity
ans
somewhat
sweet
caramel
some
bread
this
marzen
is
medium
in
body
and
adequately
carbonated
for
the
style
worth
a
try
im
not
fond
of
flying
dog
other
than
the
names
and
logos
but
this
was
pretty
good
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
clear
amber
color
and
a
reasonable
slightly
off
white
head
there
are
hints
of
metal
along
with
caramel
in
the
aroma
that
translate
well
into
the
taste
taste
is
more
roasted
caramel
with
hints
of
metal
and
some
faint
hints
of
malt
finishes
well
and
clean
d
a
tasty
enough
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
of
not
my
first
pick
but
one
that
would
go
through
regular
rotation
denjoyable
but
not
my
first
choice
for
this
style
the
complex
esters
are
nice
but
the
body
and
drink
experience
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
fizz
dogtoberfest
is
a
somewhat
disappointing
oktoberfest
it
has
no
standout
appeal
and
is
easily
lost
in
the
crowd
of
nice
oktoberfest
seasonals
beefing
it
up
all
around
would
dramatically
improve
it
as
it
is
its
just
above
average
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
though
md
softlycarbonated
medbodied
rather
fruity
like
an
ale
or
an
amber
vienna
lager
and
unlike
any
oktoberfest
lagerbier
ive
tried
but
all
in
all
a
very
decent
offering
cant
make
up
my
judgement
as
to
its
true
identity
an
ale
or
a
lager
but
this
is
quite
irrelevant
while
happily
sipping
this
fruitymalt
liquor
overall
decent
brew
but
carbonation
kills
the
drink
ability
for
me
not
in
a
hurry
to
buy
this
beer
again
d
a
tasty
blend
of
malts
that
are
very
well
balanced
the
hopping
and
carbonation
provide
further
balance
to
make
this
a
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
i
might
even
pour
one
just
to
look
at
gorgeous
this
is
a
respectable
octoberfest
but
not
stellar
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
very
caramelly
and
metallic
nose
there
wasnt
much
lacing
to
the
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
the
taste
was
fairly
uniform
nothing
sophisticated
it
was
very
caramelly
but
not
loaded
with
malts
either
it
was
rather
thin
but
the
caramel
is
the
most
pronounced
part
behind
that
is
a
touch
of
a
metallic
tinge
some
grape
skin
some
roasted
notes
and
a
herbal
hop
bite
in
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
that
will
challenge
the
palate
there
is
a
bit
too
much
aftertaste
while
the
mouthfeel
has
a
lingering
herbal
hop
bite
prefer
a
bit
more
maltiness
in
octoberfests
pours
a
beautiful
amberorange
with
a
small
1
finger
mostly
white
head
smells
of
adjuncts
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
bleeding
thru
first
sip
is
tangy
with
toasted
caramel
malts
leading
the
way
not
much
hop
presence
here
but
the
malts
seem
just
strong
enough
for
my
enjoyment
very
clean
tasting
and
quite
enjoyable
d
i
could
drink
a
gallon
not
a
great
beer
but
very
quaffable
and
that
is
really
the
name
of
the
game
dark
copper
to
red

very
thick
at

soft

the
most
expressive
beer
youll
sniff
on
light

mediumbodied
picks
up
weight
as
it
moves
forward
through
the
palate
theres
a
sort
of
dulling
bitterness
to
it
not
crisp
which
flattens
the
orange
citrus
baking
spice
and
herbal
aspects
breadiness
fares
a
little
better
good
plus

of
carbonation
caramelized
sweet

lead
the

until
the
finish
not
all
that
dry
and
crisp
there
is
a
little

bitterness
in
the
swallow
the
malt
is
light
and
the
body
is
thin
with
a
correspondingly
high

slash
bronze
hue
with
a
fluffy
white

very
impressive
marzen
here
a
slightly
different
take
a
ton
of
woody
bready
malt
some
haylike
malt
there
super
malty
not
too
much
sweetness
but
there
is
some
caramel
sweetness
there
as
the
beer
starts
to
really
warm
and
i
get
down
past
halfglass
the
sweetness
comes
out
lots
of
honey
and
caramel
pretty
complex
for
an
american
brew
very
smooth
just
the
right
thickness
carbonation
tickles
my
gums
really
satisfying
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
really
good
marzen
im
surprised
that
it
has
as
low
of
a
rating
as
it
does
check
it
out
this
fall
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
american
take
on
marzen
just
fabulous
id
have
no
problem
getting
this
occasionally
when
in
the
mood
for
this
style
taste
caramel
malts
with
a
light
hoppiness
i
agree
with
jason
alstrom
it
does
have
a
kind
of
grape
skin
flavor
going
on
as
well
d
very
nice
mixture
of
the
malts
really
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
a
nice
marzen
that
is
pretty
drinkable
clear
reddened
copper
under
a
thick
creamy
looking
head
toasted
malt
aroma
with
fruity
yeast
and
faint
sweet
dough
toasted
grains
light
sweetness
caramel
and
bread
enough
noble
hops
to
balance
properly
clean
though
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
feels
medium
and
smooth
perfectly
good
drinking
here
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
generally
prefer
a
more
prominent
toasted
element
in
an
oktoberfest
worth
having
again
but
might
not
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
d
more
flavor
would
make
me
want
to
gulp
it
down
quicker
but
its
fairly
drinkable
as
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
think
there
are
probably
some
other
marzens
available
in
my
market
that
dont
cost
as
much
as
this
one
and
taste
even
better
simple
marzen
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
lighter
yellow
with
small
amount
of
foam
a
slight
amount
of
toasted
bread
decent
malt
and
the
bit
of
toasting
good
with
pizza
suitable
carbonation
decent
sweetness
not
too
sweet
a
bit
drying
about
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
looked
fantastic
just
like
an
oktoberfest
should
bright
orangecopper
with
great
clarity
the
head
was
a
toasted
cream
color
and
three
fingers
thick
and
it
displayed
pretty
good
retention
and
some
like
clingtotheglass
lacing
the
aroma
was
also
nice
caramel
malt
and
doughy
malt
with
some
spiciness
and
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
drier
than
the
aroma
assorted
grains
and
some
bitterness
mixed
with
a
slightly
herbal
character
not
quite
as
rich
or
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
but
the
finish
was
crisp
medium
body
good
carbonation
for
the
style
and
likely
sessionable
d
just
average
wouldnt
need
to
buy
this
one
again
not
too
bad
but
not
that
great
ive
had
better
marzens
and
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
offering
this
is
a
nice
marzen
the
color
is
a
bit
darker
than
most
a
dark
amber
the
head
is
slight
and
tan
and
leaves
little
lacing
a
pleasant
but
mild
nose
leads
into
a
very
nice
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
rather
neutral
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
superb
autumn
session
beer
nice
mouthfeel
with
texture
but
not
too
thick
i
think
ill
suck
down
another
one
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
slightly
oxidized
malt
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
taste
is
better
malt
dominated
with
a
hint
of
sourness
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
rounds
things
out
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
i
could
go
for
this
again
though
there
are
better
oktoberfests
out
there
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
yeast
and
light
nutty
malt
with
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
a
blend
of
watery
nutty
malt
and
sweet
barley
and
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
pretty
good
flavor
but
it
wasnt
very
clean
the
body
was
ok
but
the
beer
in
general
was
just
not
very
impressive
this
would
only
be
really
drinkable
after
youve
already
had
a
better
beer
or
two
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lightly
carbonated
beer
with
a
mediumlight
body
the
beer
is
smooth
however
id
really
like
to
see
a
creamy
body
on
an
oktoberfest
itd
be
a
nice
bonus
a
full
bodied
rich
creamy
feel
to
a
nice
big
malty
beer
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
again
however
its
not
my
first
chioce
for
an
oktoberfest
but
behind
avery
kaiser
glbc
moerlein
and
possibly
hackerpschorr
this
is
my
next
pick
so
many
of
the
oktoberfests
out
there
are
really
shit
this
one
is
not
its
just
that
there
are
a
few
id
rather
drink
over
this
one
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
more
that
id
rather
not
drink
and
would
choose
this
one
out
of
just
about
all
imported
oktoberfests
and
many
of
the
micro
brewed
ones
this
one
for
me
with
the
ofests
ive
sampled
thus
far
is
in
my
top
ten
its
a
little
thin
watery
but
overall
i
really
liked
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
of
a
sweet
almost
sour
malts
at
first
taste
its
good
a
solid
lager
that
is
crisp
and
goes
down
well
not
too
much
in
the
flavor
category
no
hop
taste
and
some
barely
spiced
malts
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
off
a
little
bitter
goes
down
decent
though
i
wouldnt
consider
it
an
octoberfest
beer
its
pretty
good
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
sitting
d
everyone
i
have
shared
this
with
have
said
this
is
the
better
octoberfest
i
disagree
it
is
however
a
good
beer
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
enjoyed
this
season
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
one
d
thanks
to
joepais
for
throwing
this
in
with
my
growling
at
the
moon
box
pretty
solid
effort
serving
type
bottle
d
ok
i
had
expected
more
from
flying
dog
it
is
alright
and
i
was
expecting
great
compared
to
where
some
of
the
mass
produce
ofest
beers
from
germany
are
going
this
one
held
its
own
not
a
bad
pick
for
the
style
drinkability
overall
this
was
an
ok
octoberfest
beer
has
a
different
taste
then
the
average
marzen
but
its
not
as
good
as
some
of
them
either
this
isnt
bad
but
there
is
definately
better
out
there
d
not
my
top
choice
of
marzen
but
worth
a
try
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
then
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
pretty
drinkable
marzen
overall
better
than
some
of
the
more
commercial
ofests
ive
had
though
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
more
respectable
brews
of
the
style
the
brew
went
down
well
i
had
it
for
a
fall
picnic
with
the
family
it
defiantly
got
me
in
the
mood
for
fall
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
smell
isnt
too
strong
but
there
is
bread
yeastroasted
maltand
some
hop
scents
the
taste
has
more
hops
than
other
oktoberfests
along
with
roasted
maltdark
fruitand
bread
yeast
the
mf
is
light
and
somewhat
thin
not
badbut
you
can
find
better
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
nice
copper
color
kind
of
light
with
a
bit
of
initial
head
but
no
lacing
at
all
nice
scent
almost
all
malty
not
as
strong
as
it
could
be
good
taste
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
very
nice
bit
of
hoppiness
at
the
end
a
nice
full
bodied
beer
goes
down
fine
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
perhaps
a
good
oktoberfest
but
not
the
best
nor
the
best
flying
dog
beer
drinkability
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
one
did
enjoy
this
one
not
sure
where
to
rate
this
one
compared
to
the
last
one
i
had
but
it
is
just
as
good
but
more
flavor
truth
be
told
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
marzen
being
a
fan
of
flying
dog
beers
and
maybe
that
wasnt
fair
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
let
down
still
its
worth
a
shot
for
the
time
of
year
were
in
but
i
likely
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
the
sweeter
oktoberfests
that
arent
as
heavy
on
hoppy
and
toasty
flavors
so
this
one
was
right
up
my
alley
worth
a
shot
for
this
time
of
year
this
fall
seasonal
pours
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
small
and
shrinking
head
little
lacing
going
on
here
smell
is
weak
what
is
there
is
sweet
toasty
malts
taste
is
a
bit
more
present
the
sweet
malt
aspect
here
has
more
of
a
buttery
biscuit
aspect
the
hops
arent
very
notable
until
the
very
end
mouthfeel
is
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
despite
the
heavy
malt
aspects
all
in
all
a
decent
marzen
and
quite
drinkable
solid
and
complex
but
hardly
an
exemplary
oktoberfest
all
in
all
the
beer
is
solid
but
the
thinness
on
the
mouthfeel
really
ruins
the
beer
maybe
bump
the
beer
up
to
6
and
itll
be
better
a
better
beer
than
the
scores
on
here
not
a
great
beer
or
anything
but
one
you
can
have
a
few
of
and
really
enjoy
a
seasonal
without
the
offputting
taste
most
seasonal
brews
offer
i
dont
dig
most
falloktoberfest
beers
i
like
this
beer
i
noticed
some
other
less
favorable
reviews
and
i
can
see
where
this
oktoberfest
might
fall
short
when
compared
to
others
but
on
the
whole
this
is
a
totally
drinkable
beer
quite
sessionable
to
boot
a
fine
fall
drinker
verdict
while
the
fundamentals
of
this
beer
seem
strong
its
just
too
thin
to
really
inspire
me
if
they
really
cranked
up
the
malt
on
this
beer
closer
to
what
youd
expect
in
a
märzen
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
real
winner
however
with
the
body
as
thin
as
it
is
this
beer
is
simply
an
average
oktoberfest
offering
fairly
refreshing
in
character
and
drinkable
as
well
but
for
the
style
this
beer
proves
too
hoppy
more
caramel
malt
flavor
should
be
detectable
but
the
hops
truly
take
over
this
one
certainly
an
american
characteristic
not
to
mention
characteristic
for
this
brewery
but
damaging
for
a
beer
of
this
type
mfd
lightmed
in
body
finishes
silky
smooth
but
leaves
a
distinct
unwelcomed
aftertaste
a
little
sour
maybe
i
usually
like
fds
offerings
but
this
one
does
not
do
it
for
me
at
all
too
watery
not
enough
sweet
maltyness
and
the
metallic
hoppy
flavors
make
this
one
barely
drinkable
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
on
the
whole
rather
good
it
is
not
a
standout
okoberfest
but
is
certainly
a
good
enough
representative
of
the
style
as
to
merit
purchase
and
a
return
pass
i
find
it
typical
of
flying
dog
for
the
most
part
which
is
good
occasionally
great
gonzo
comes
to
mind
first
and
foremost
occasionally
disappointing
but
usually
steady
this
typifies
the
steadiness
of
flying
dog
that
id
recommend
without
reservation
notesit
was
not
the
worst
oktoberfest
by
any
stretchjust
not
something
i
will
seek
any
time
soon
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
worthy
of
a
session
any
day
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
pours
reddish
brown
in
color
what
little
head
there
is
that
forms
on
the
pour
is
gone
by
the
time
i
sit
down
smell
is
malty
and
somewhat
floral
taste
is
more
of
the
caramel
malt
but
im
also
getting
a
sweet
brown
sugar
flavor
as
well
not
bad
decent
mouthfeel
that
is
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
though
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
pretty
low
on
my
list
of
oktoberfests
an
ok
beer
copper
color
with
a
modest
white
head
decent
aroma
of
caramel
and
flowers
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
some
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
i
thought
it
was
thin
in
the
mouth
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
after
youve
mowed
the
lawn
just
noticed
this
was
my
300th
review
not
too
exciting
ill
have
to
make
301
good
d
an
alright
beer
i
remember
this
being
better
but
cest
la
vie
it
did
the
job
last
night
with
friends
but
its
hardly
a
brew
to
ponder
over
as
ive
attempted
to
do
with
a
glass
at
the
moment
d
drinkable
not
my
favorite
octoberfest
but
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
fairly
to
style
would
have
again
if
offered
but
proabably
would
not
seek
out
d
had
a
12oz
draft
pour
and
that
was
enough
the
spiciness
cuts
it
down
quite
a
bit
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
d
a
decent
brew
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
worth
a
try
though
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
brew
i
havent
had
too
many
oktoberfests
yet
but
if
you
had
blindfolded
me
and
told
me
this
was
flying
dogs
new
version
of
their
pale
ale
i
wouldve
believed
it
good
taste
great
mouthfeel
very
light
and
smooth
but
not
very
impressive
or
memorable
m
medium
body
soft
to
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
some
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
low
i
was
able
to
finish
this
but
had
no
desire
to
go
find
more
of
these
id
much
rather
drink
other
oktoberfest
beers
or
almost
any
of
flying
dogs
other
offerings
recommended
d
drinkability
was
ok
nothing
great
and
was
expecting

this

poured
a

with
some
rocky

but
little

the
taste
is
spicy

malty
and
lacking
in

the
taste
is
a
bit
like
toasted

clove
the

borders
on
sticky
which
is
odd
to
me
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
the
aroma
was
citrusy

spice
i
tasted
a
maltiness
and
a

it
was

overall
it
was
just
an

for
me

a

not

either
a
very

it
has
a

that
makes
it
an

brew
d

is
delightful

a

disappointing
in
the

department
takes
a

not
a
classic

feel
its
a

in

almost
feel

the

to
come

nevertheless
still
an

my

one

ones
i
am
holding
on
to
my
avery
kaiser
for
a
while
highly
recommended
marzen
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
flying

overall
this
is
a
decent
marzen
with
one
major
shortcoming
in
the
flavor
with
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
up
front
this
has
the
potential
to
be
an

background
and
a
curious

note
sweet
crystal

upfront
makes
up
the
basis
of
the

profile
it
has
a

with

and
perhaps
some
faint

the

flavor
and
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
are
just
barely
perceivable
but
achive
an
acceptable
balance
an
odd
figdate
taste
appears
with
the
slightly
residual
sweetness
but
dissapears
quickly
enough
to
not
become
distracting
a
lightish

and
medium
carbonation
present
a
true
to
style
mouthfeel

is

one
of
the
best
american
adaptations
of
marzenbier
i
have
tried
i
love
flying
dog
brews
but
this
one
seems
to
be
intentionaly
aimed
at
the
masses
would
do
better
as
a
summer
brew
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
clean
copper
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
ditto
the
lacing
sweet
malts
and
yeast
are
prevalent
with
no
hop
presence
either
in
the
smell
or
on
the
palate
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
worth
a
try
but
like
most
american
efforts
on
the
style
it
comes
up
short
forgettable
but
not
regrettable
beer
should
be
friendly
malty
and
easy
drinking
worth
a
shot
if
for
nothing
else
than
to
experience
the
wonderfully
sweet
aroma
pours
a
copper
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
nice
and
inviting
no
hops
that
i
can
detect
the
taste
follows
right
along
with
a
strong
malt
character
starts
sweet
and
ends
with
somewhat
of
a
bite
the
aftertaste
is
subtle
a
little
doughy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
flavors
decent
balance
this
is
an
easy
drinker

beer

taste
was
bitter
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
reminded
me
of
almost
stale
wheat
bread
it
was
slightly
sweet
which
went
well
with
the
grain

ok
in
the
mouth
a
little
dry
didnt
coat
as
well
as
i
like
easy
to
drink

sharp
in

which
detracted
drinkability
great
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
way
to
celebrate
the

drinkable
i
suppose
but
i
think
im
already
bored

very

about
1
or

before

i
keep
wanting
to
give
this
a
chance
if
it
was
an
ipa
id
have
no
problem
with
the
hops
but
as
it
is
itll
get
no
further
breaks
from
me
imho
for
the
style
the
hops
are
just
simply
over
the
top
it
would
be
easy
to
finish
a
pint
or
a
liter
of
this
one
havent
seen
it
on
tap
locally
though
sampled
during
oktoberfest
at
back
door

utica
il
drinkability
a
decent
offering
but
with
so
many
other
great
ofest
beers
out
there
i
dont
plan
on
coming
back
to
it
left
me
hoping
to
find
a
few
more
like
it
before
the
season
ends
d
probably
the
best
american
oktoberfest
i
have
ever
had
a
very
good
beer
very
drinkable
as
for
the
mouthfeel
its
smooth
but
a
bit
matted
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
another
quality
selection
from
flying
dog
not
nearly
their
best
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
certainly
worth
another
try
next
fall
da
beer
that
i
prob
will
not
have
again
not
impressed
d
easily
drinkable
and
good
i
liked
it
and
one
of
the
best
when
it
comes
to
style
that
ive
had
in
a
while
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
d
drinkability
is
good
since
the
brew
is
light
not
strong
on
alcohol
so
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
a
little
too
weak
and
bitter
for
me
though
poured
into
my
pint
glass
a
crystal
clear
copper
oktoberfest
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
and
leaves
just
a
ring
of
fine
bubbles
around
the
wall
of
the
pint
glass
toasted
malt
aroma
no
hop
aroma
toasted
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
caramel
no
hop
flavor
beer
finished
a
bit
dry
for
style
i
think
but
overall
is
nice
interesting
taste
if
it
wasnt
labeled
an
octoberfest
id
have
a
hard
time
figuring
that
out
worth
a
taste
if
you
like
the
brewery
this
oktoberfest
is
a
brilliantly
clear
golden
copper
color
very
striking
the
head
is
thin
white
and
quickly
diminished
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
that
of
toasted
grains
with
a
low
caramel
sweetness
little
if
any
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
intensely
malty
that
of
toasted
grains
some
bready
character
and
a
low
residual
sweetness
the
bitterness
is
mediumlow
and
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
on
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
body
is
medium
maybe
mediumfull
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
a
very
very
good
oktoberfest
i
appreciate
the
intense
malt
flavor
and
striking
appearance
the
most
but
cant
find
a
fault
with
this
brew
highly
recommend
overall
a
very
good
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
well
worth
a
try
orangish
copper
colored
brew
tiny
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
somewhat
of
a
caramel
malt
scent
taste
is
mainly
comprised
of
the
malty
oktober
taste
backed
by
some
bit
of
hops
fairly
thinly
bodied
overall
not
the
worst
beer
but
as
far
as
fest
beer
goes
there
are
many
beers
that
should
be
tried
before
this
one
its
all
fur
coat
and
no
trousers
it
is
eh
another
mediocre
oktoberfest
from
a
brewery
that
does
mostly
ales
its
too
bad
that
this
style
is
so
often
used
as
a
seasonal
marketing
gimmick
from
brewers
that
dont
really
know
what
theyre
doing
with
lager
styles
better
as
it
warms
a
decent
beer
overall
pours
a
tawny
amber
in
color
like
a
darkened
glass
of
iced
tea
a
nice
collar
of
18
inch
head
that
disappears
as
fast
as
it
arose
faint
caramel
in
the
nose
some
bready
malt
and
little
else
caramel
takes
on
a
bit
more
of
a
toffee
note
on
the
tongue
and
is
fairly
mild
the
highlight
is
the
quick
tingle
of
carbonation
and
hops
that
dominate
the
middle
through
the
end
with
a
nice
residual
aftertaste
the
malt
profile
is
a
bit
bland
compared
to
most
but
i
do
enjoy
the
crispness
of
it
drinkability
is
excellent
being
a
session
beer
but
purists
might
want
to
avoid
it
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
this
brewery
and
this
marzen
indicates
why
id
rather
see
five
failures
somehow
redeemed
but
a
couple
of
great
brews
but
flying
dog
is
consistently
mediocre
in
every
regard
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
imo
nice
copper
color
and
foamy
head
to
this
one
but
the
rest
of
it
was
fairly
average
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
grains
sweet
caramel
but
taste
seemed
offbalance
to
me
i
expected
more
maltiness
and
while
its
there
it
fades
quickly
to
leave
a
bitter
hoppiness
not
bad
just
probably
not
one
id
pick
out
for
an
oktoberfest
example
okay
so
this
is
above
the
pack
but
not
enough
to
make
it
far
enough
above
the
pack
id
probably
get
this
if
served
at
an
octoberfest
but
usually
this
year
its
sa
or
becks
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
the
best
octoberfest
i
have
had
but
it
is
far
from
the
worst
i
kinda
enjoyed
it
thin
yellowish
cap
tops
this
clear
reddish
beer
malty
aroma
quite
toasty
with
mild
floral
hopping

well
and

through

middle
of
the
sweetness

throughout
mediumlight
body
with

carbonation
decent
mouthfeel
a
hint
of
warmth
a
little
better
than

nice
toastiness
but
it
didnt
come
together
for
me
the
way
the
best
marzens
do

reminds
me
of

version
looks
the

drinkable
12oz
brown
bottle
from
rons
in
farmington
pours
translucent
redamber
body
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
malty
sweet
with
some
roastiness
though
the
aroma
is
somewhat
muted
tastes
sweet
and
roasty
with
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
playing
a
big
role
very
tasty
and
one
sip
definitely
invites
another
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
im
really
impressed
with
this
one
a
new
favorite
for
the
style
overall
oktoberfests
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
pretty
subpar
version
the
flavors
are
a
mishmash
and
not
appealing
to
me
drinks
pretty
easy
but
off
style
not
as
good
as
last
years
offering
by
a
mile
imo
this
is
my
second
beer
from
flying
dog
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
their
other
offerings
very
good
beer
pours
an
attractive
copper
color
and
a
nice
slightly
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
maltiness
taste
is
also
very
malty
but
not
overly
done
balanced
with
a
faint
nuttiness
lacing
is
good
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
not
too
thick
or
thin
and
level
of
carbonation
is
excellent
drinkability
is
pretty
high
actually
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
another
style
that
i
have
really
grown
to
appreciate
pours
a
rich
golden
amberwith
a
fluffy
white
head
very
good
retentionand
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
dark
fruitcarmelsand
malts
this
is
medium
bodied
beerthat
is
lightly
carbionated
taste
is
of
fruitand
honey
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
poured
clear
amber
with
a
short
cap
of
whitish
head
the
aroma
picked
up
sweet
toasted
caramel
but
focused
more
on
the
sweetness
than
the
malty
backing
there
were
some
herbal
notes
some
bread
and
a
grass
accent
the
flavor
also
had
a
sweet
toasty
caramel
backbone
with
bready
malts
in
there
too
the
herbal
and
leafy
hop
accents
worked
well
some
peppery
spices
appear
right
at
the
very
end
and
serve
to
make
this
even
more
refreshing
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
bitter
bite
on
the
edges
and
a
mediumlength
refreshing
finish
i
find
that
flying
dogs
beer
always
have
a
bit
of
their
own
taste
and
this
is
no
exception
good
not
my
favorite
but
goodgreat
as
part
of
the
style
of
all
the
seasonals
that
i
have
tasted
this
season
this
is
far
and
beyond
the
best
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
great
color
and
a
nice
head
excellent
beer
for
watching
football
and
just
relaxing
with
friends
flying
dog
has
really
outdone
itself
with
this
beer
not
too
expensive
either
i
paid
7
99
for
a
six
pack
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
downright
dark
garnet
with
a
solidenough
head
that
barely
laces
the
top
of
the
brew
aroma
is
malty
some
caramel
and
biscuity
goodness
taste
is
very
solid
clean
and
malty
not
overly
sweet
but
not
much
from
the
hops
though
there
is
a
slight
dry
finish
that
helps
to
balance
slightly
overall
i
was
impressed
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
proved
to
be
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
attempt
at
the
style
overall
impression
solid
beer
total
package
is
balance
flavorful
but
moderate
nice
malty
beer
that
has
me
looking
forward
to
fall
weather
pours
out
a
light
orange
tinted
amber
with
abundant
excited
bubbles
and
a
sturdy
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lace
on
the
glass
theres
a
good
maltiness
in
the
nose
but
it
is
awfully
faint
its
hard
to
get
much
out
of
this
but
there
is
an
underlying
grainy
character
that
im
just
not
that
fond
of
taste
is
a
bit
light
as
well
and
takes
on
a
somewhat
watery
thinness
towards
the
finish
i
found
this
also
to
be
the
case
with
their
wheat
beer
theres
some
nice
caramelized
malt
flavors
but
the
maltiness
doesnt
come
out
as
much
as
id
like
this
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
maibock
more
than
anything
else
hops
are
rather
punchy
but
kind
of
muddy
things
up
with
a
dull
and
lingering
bitterness
a
bit
of
graininess
is
found
in
the
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
yet
still
sticky
carbonation
is
solid
decent
beer
overall
id
take
it
over
some
oktoberfests
ive
had
in
the
past
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
d
very
good
went
down
pretty
easily
but
was
by
no
means
flavorless
overall
all
i
can
really
say
is
wow
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
years
release
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
now
i
do
figure
there
will
be
at
least
several
if
not
dozens
more
in
the
style
i
will
try
over
the
next
month
of
two
however
this
bar
has
been
set
pretty
high
this
was
really
at
the
top
of
everything
i
was
looking
for
at
the
time
just
really
great
and
you
must
get
your
hands
on
it
now
to
relax
with
another
as
that
was
damn
good
drinkability
way
to
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
a
drain
pour
final
note
this
is
a
good
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
go
out
and
get
some
if
its
available
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
recommended
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
this
said
not
the
most
exciting
oktoberfest
but
a
good
one
drinkability
the
runt
of
the
oktoberfest
litter
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
one
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
and
it
just
ends
up
being
your
run
of
the
mill
oktoberfest
brew
not
bad
but
simply
not
memorable
d
a
solid
unflawed
marzan
however
nothing
particuarly
exciting
all
things
considered
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
very
complex
but
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
this
fall
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
without
it
being
too
overbearing
decent
example
of
a
domestic
oktoberfest
overall
a
disappointing
octoberfest
very
plain
and
uninspired
you
can
do
alot
better
dthis
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
this
type
beer
normally
but
this
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
domestic
octoberfest
is
full
flavored
and
well
worth
seeking
out
ill
be
keeping
this
on
hand
for
the
fall
season
alongside
the
triedandtrue
delicious
original
hackerpschorr
oktoberfest
well
done
thank
yous
all
around
to
the
flying
dog
team
d
not
really
that
impressive
overall
it
just
seemed
like
it
was
lacking
a
little
something
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
would
definitely
get
again
mouthfeel
is
interesting
and
seems
to
straddle
between
lager
and
ale
characteristics
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
slightly
better
than
average
and
could
be
a
decent
fall
session
beer
overall
impression
nice
and
drinkable
actually
one
of
flying
dogs
better
beers
even
if
it
isnt
exactly
true
to
style
i
bought
this
expecting
a
lager
but
it
doesnt
say
that
anywhere
on
the
packaging
i
wonder
if
it
is
an
alright
beer
but
of
course
there
are
a
lot
better
12oz
bottle
given
to
me
by
a
friend
in
a
mixed
6pack
all
i
needed
was
one
bottle
to
review
this
as
its
an
easy
beer
to
figure
out
malt
aroma
on
top
of
more
malt
malty
goodness
yum
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
luscious
head
and
lace
malty
taste
with
bittering
hops
to
balance
i
believe
this
to
be
an
ale
and
not
a
true
marzen
lager
because
of
a
fruity
aroma
and
taste
there
are
many
octoberfest
ales
in
the
usharpoon
for
example
nonetheless
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
d
this
wasnt
bad
pretty
drinkable
at
all
temperatures
12
oz
bottle
with
some
code
it
pours
a
crystalclear
reddish
amber
with
high
carbonation
and
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
but
the
flavor
consists
of
toasted
lightly
roasted
malts
caramel
molasses
some
green
hops
and
a
light
fruitiness
it
has
a
tingly
drying
light
to
medium
body
with
equal
finish
not
horrible
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
poured
a
reddishamber
color
which
was
quite
clear
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
sour
there
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
helps
offset
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
a
mild
smooth
beer
that
makes
a
very
drinkable
brew
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
ahold
of
has
one
of
the
most
artistic
bottle
labels
funny
and
yest
true
to
the
style
this
beer
poutred
with
a
thick
white
head
that
had
a
mixture
of
small
and
large
bubbles
its
reddish
brown
color
invites
you
to
the
glass
average
hop
aroma
much
like
a
spaten
taste
clean
and
crisp
with
a
hoppy
finish
light
on
the
tongue
and
mouthfeel
very
true
to
the
ocktoberfest
style
definitly
not
the
best
in
style
obviously
goes
well
with
a
german
meal
lack
of
strength
is
the
biggest
drawback
in
flavor
average
offering
that
you
would
do
better
to
pass
up
in
favor
of
others
on
the
shelf
drinkability
could
drink
several
of
these
makes
me
look
forward
to
october
drinkability
a
fine
oktoberfest
offering
avoids
the
let
down
of
many
of
the
other
flying
dog
beers
for
me
tried
this
at
a
flying
dog
beer
tasting
at
the
local
package
store
poured
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
and
okay
lacing
maltysweet
aroma
with
not
much
else
in
the
nose
taste
was
very
mild
drinkable
but
not
real
flavorful
finish
was
nice
and
smooth
not
great
but
a
decent
autumn
fest
beer
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
one
of
then
better
ofests
i
had
this
year
i
will
try
it
again
next
year
for
sure
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
traces
of
lace
nice
deep
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
malty

starts
smooth
and
balanced

1
25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
smileys
beverage
dover
nh
a
good
call
definitely
essential
hardly
i
found
this
an
enjoyable
if
not
remarkable
marzen
it
was
tasty
and
refreshing
with
mild
sweetness
and
med
body
it
was
a
little
light
for
my
taste
for
an
octoberfest
but
good
none
the
less
i
find
the
flying
dog
styles
a
little
hit
and
miss
sometimes
but
this
was
more
of
the
hit
variety
nice
amber
color
enduring
head
retention
and
appropriate
mouthfeel
rounded
out
a
good
marzen
d
one
of
the
more
unique
octoberfest
selections
ive
tried
this
year
id
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
next
year
and
enjoy
them
over
the
fall
season
im
curious
how
this
one
will
change
over
a
few
weeks
overall
a
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
the
taste
was
seemingly
authentic
and
a
very
solid
session
beer
one
of
the
best
domestic
versions
i
have
had
the
hops
are
much
more
prevelent
in
the
flavor
actually
competing
with
as
opposed
to
merely
balancing
the
malts
little
bit
of
a
tang
actually
slightly
metallic
finish
however
its
got
some
nearly
fruity
flavors
but
stays
within
the
realm
of
malt
character
drinkability
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
brew
but
this
needs
a
bit
more
heft
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
on
the
drier
side
of
the
style
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
hop
characteristic
could
easy
donwn
a
couple
steins
of
this
at
a
festival
it
didnt
rock
my
socks
but
its
certaintly
a
solid
octoberfest
offering
drinkability
ehhh
i
had
one
and
didnt
want
one
afterward
overall
this
is
the
best
octoberfest
ive
had
this
year
and
a
very
sessionable
beer
cup
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
first
few
sips
very
hard
to
finish
the
whole
beer
pours
a
bright
clean
amber
orange
hue
tanish
off
white
head
it
sticks
around
for
a
while
good
lacing
of
the
pint
glass
sweet
raisin
fruit
like
malt
smell
tangy
malt
wafting
to
my
nose
faint
citrus
hop
scent
smells
like
a
true
mezen
oktoberfest
smooth
malt
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
nice
medium
body
mild
hop
after
taste
very
malted
flavor
nice
sweet
presentation
of
this
beer
strong
caramel
malt
tones
with
the
faint
hop
finish
make
this
a
true
to
style
brew
nice
oktoberfest
offering
very
tasty
beer
smooth
and
drinkable
good
mouth
feel
not
to
thick
with
a
nice
medium
body
and
perfect
carbonation
this
was
my
first
brew
from
flying
dog
and
is
scores
well
with
me
great
seasonal
offering
they
hit
this
style
right
on
the
nose
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
another
one
of
there
offerings
this
beer
is
a
darker
shade
of
orange
with
a
quickly
dissaparing
head
the
semll
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
underlying
spice
scent
the
taste
is
actually
fairly
bitter
for
the
style
there
is
some
hints
of
pumkin
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
average
beer
of
the
style
sweet
maltiness
comes
to
the
nose
after
pouring
this
mahogany
hued
brew
a
head
about
an
inch
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
sheet
floating
atop
of
the
body
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
this
style
but
actually
makes
this
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
and
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
that
compliments
the
light
hop
appearance
it
takes
a
lot
for
me
to
enjoy
octoberfest
beers
but
this
still
came
below
average
for
the
style
this
is
one
om
with
some
oomph
or
maybe
oompa
is
more
like
it
very
light
sweetness
slides
into
nutty
tastes
and
quickly
darkens
to
deep
malt
caramel
sweetness
there
is
an
undersatated
fruitiness
in
the
forefront
of
this
beer
malt
flavor
continues
to
fill
out
as
hop
bitterness
comes
on
strong
in
the
finish
this
can
definately
stand
up
to
heavy
food
which
is
important
to
me
in
this
style
however
slight
heaviness
of
this
beer
hurts
drinkability
which
is
also
important
for
this
style
i
wish
the
overall
taste
was
brighter
but
this
is
a
special
ofest
a
very
good
marzen
well
worth
a
try
it
was
quite
refreshing
and
i
must
say
it
went
well
as
a
stand
alone
or
with
spicy
food
im
not
an
oktoberfest
aficionado
by
any
means
but
even
i
can
recognize
that
there
are
much
better
versions
of
the
style
than
this
one
still
though
its
an
okay
little
seasonal
that
isnt
too
challenging
and
could
be
consumed
by
the
liter
mugful
while
munching
on
some
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
oktoberfest
to
me
its
far
fruitier
and
is
more
like
a
summer
refresher
with
a
stronger
backbone
thats
no
reason
to
hate
or
dismiss
the
beer
of
course
but
its
not
a
taste
of
fall
at
all
appearance
has
a
caramel
amber
body
with
a
large
off
white
head
very
nice
look
to
it
leaves
behind
fine
lacing
all
the
way
through
aroma
contains
some
copper
penny
metallic
tones
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
some
herbal
hop
presence
nice
smell
taste
slight
bitterness
apparent
from
the
noble
gassy
hop
tones
leaves
light
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
there
as
well
nice
oktoberfest
definitely
has
a
good
bit
of
flavor
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
bodied
goes
down
smooth
with
even
smooth
carbonation
drinkability
a
decent
offering
from
flying
dog
never
wowed
by
their
beers
but
this
one
is
solid
and
ill
probably
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
decent
taste
not
very
filling
easy
to
drink
however
if
im
going
to
pound
an
ofest
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
choose
first
poured
a
copperish
amber
with
very
little
head
that
diminshed
quickly
left
no
lacing
rather
just
a
fog
of
condensation
on
the
glass
aroma
is
well
balanced
with
both
caramel
malt
and
piney
hop
character
flavor
is
strong
of
caraemel
malt
with
an
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
slight
hop
bitterness
overall
a
fine
version
of
an
octoberfest
lager
but
far
from
the

better

by
a
step
worse
than
great
by
a

steps
and
good
or

hate
to
be
so
ambivalent
but
this
beer
inspires
that
reaction
in
me
sure
it
drinks
well
enough
which
is

not

ill
have
another

the
flavor
starts
with

note
and
slides
into
a
dry
snappy
finish
with
a

tabacco
bitterness
on
the
roof

to

this
is

best
oktoberfests
ive
had
yet
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
was
developing
the
opinion
i
just
didnt
find
this
style
appealing
as
a
whole
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
please
sir
may
i
have
another
one
flavor
is
nice
and
round
up
front
but
descends
into
an
oversweet
aftertaste
that
isnt
helped
by
a
watery
texture
with
grittiness
in
the
mouth
once
the
sip
is
finished
if
it
fulfilled
its
promise
it
would
be
an
excellent

bier
but
instead
falls
into
a
sea
of
mediocre
marzen
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with

spectacular

always
entertaining
typical
marzen
coppery

on
a

in

to
other
ofests
ive
sampled
mainly
characterized
by
a
giant
malty
backbone
with
undertones
of
sweet
toffeecaramel
and
the
roasty

aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lighter

with

carbonation
leads
the
light
smooth
characteristics
of
this
beer
smooth
and
silky
goes
down
with
the
faintest
drying
roasty
malt
aftertaste
drinkability
is
great
just
a
hair
over
5
abv
and
an
appreciative
yet
not
overbearing
complexity
make
this
a
superb
session
brew
overall
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
flying
dog
but
not
the
best
oktoberfest
there
is
would
purchase
again
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
nice
oktoberfest
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
the
body
is
light
and
somewhat
wispy
really
not
much
going
on
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
light
finish
d
i
could
session
this
one
easy
like
many
good
marzens
its
easy
to
drink
quickly
and
plentifully
one
of
the
most
easydrinking
enjoyable
beers
ive
tried
even
my
generally
antibeer
fiancee
loved
it
for
its
great
fruit
notes
and
mild
but
present
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
thin
but
it
has
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
with
a
lingering
caramel
sweetness
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
tried
cheers
dogtoberfest
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
not
much
aroma
what
aroma
there
is
id
call
malty
flavor
starts
off
with
some
citrusy
hop
flavor
with
a
backbone
of
wet
cardboard
malt
i
dont
think
there
really
is
a
better
way
to
describe
it
unfortunate
as
i
think
flying
dog
makes
some
really
good
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
smells
like
toasy
malts
the
taste
is
malty
for
sure
caramel
and
roasted
flavors
and
a
slightly
herbal
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
great
a
nice
heavy
medium
with
the
right
amout
of
carbonation
overall
id
say
this
is
above
average
but
everyone
and
thier
brother
makes
oktoberfest
so
ill
probably
have
to
wait
for
next
year
to
drink
more
a
slightly
above
average
brew
that
i
could
definitely
enjoy
again
but
there
are
so
many
more
to
try
by
far
one
of
the
better
more
well
crafted
brews
by
flying
dog
overall
a
very
sessionable
oktoberfest
nothing
great
but
not
bad

all

crisp
and
refreshing
a

but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
brew
is
not
a
bad
one
you
can
find
many
more
worse
beers
maybe
not
the
top
of
the
line
octoberfest
but
a
decent
one
not
much
head
and
not
much
smell
are
the
downfalls
but
has
a
light
body
somewhat
crisp
and
clear
with
some
caramel
notes
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
a
fairly
low
abv
not
a
bad
brew
and
i
will
drink
it
again
terribly
unfulfilling
very
well
done
a
very
nice
slightly
american
the
yeasty
sulphur
version
of
the
classic
vienna
lager
style
that
can
hold
its
own
against
the
beers
of
munich
particularly
as
they
seem
to
be
dumbing
them
down
a
little
bit
more
each
year
kudos
to
the
dog
a
thick
rich
mouthfeel
leaves
a
long
satisfying
finish
very
good
oktoberfest
overall
not
a
very
good
octoberfest
there
are
much
better
choices
out
there
overall
i
was
expecting
better
but
even
still
this
is
worth
a
try
still
glimmering
copper
maintains
a
dull
lifeless
appearance
with
an
offwhite
head
that
disappears
at
a
rapid
rate
roasted
malts
and
chestnuts
graze
the
nose
more
roastynutty
aromas
appear
towards
the
middle
medium
bodied
a
bit
dry
upfront
grainy
and
some
dark
roasted
malts
toasted
wheat
bread
burnt
biscuits
and
some
mild
notes
of
chocolate
in
the
body
lacks
the
full
and
rich
flavorings
that
most
ofests
offer
this
is
passable
barely
overall
let
down
by
the
mouthfeel
more
than
the
staid
taste
profile
this
has
an
unrefined
feel
to
it
something
is
not
quite
right
with
this
whilst
the
annoying
aspects
are
large
in
nature
it
feels
like
only
a
minor
tweak
would
rescue
this
one
and
improve
it
no
end
rather
disappointing
far
from
a
dog
of
brew
but
not
one
that
i
would
get
again
shame
i
was
hoping
for
more
enjoyable
brew
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
last
night
light
khaki
color
head
good
amount
too
that
stuck
around
awhile
pretty
good
lacing
a
light
copper
color
with
reddish
tones
the
smell
is
not
that
great
reminds
me
of
dawn
dishwashing
detergent
unfortunately
mild
hoppiness
suggests
some
bitterness
but
there
is
a
bland
aftertaste
a
little
more
sweet
from
the
malts
than
i
expected
for
an
octoberfest
with
time
the
beer
becomes
smoother
losing
its
crispness
though
and
gets
more
mellow
slightly
average
beer
for
the
style
but
drinkable
nonetheless
this
is
a
really
nice
fall
refresher
should
go
well
with
most
tailgate
foods
while
not
bad
to
throw
back
with
pizza
by
itself
there
are
too
many
better
octoberfest
examples
out
there
i
recommend
passing
on
this
one

i

a

into

aroma
is
that
of
slightly
nutty
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
kinda
gets
to
me
it
starts
out
slightly
catty
and
hoppy
but
as
it
warms
it
gets
slightly
sour
i
dont
like
sour
octoberfests
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
are

except
that
drinkablity
suffers
due

the
sour
taste
12
ounce
bottle
dogtoberfest
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
head
much
lacing
remains
on
my
glass
as
i
drink
the
aroma
is
very
weak
i
detect
a
little
caramel
and
some
grain
and
nothing
else
flavor
is
light
on
the
mouth
with
sweet
malt
and
a
fruitiness
most
often
found
in
ales
the
flavor
is
very
clean
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
but
this
is
the
only
aspect
of
the
flavor
that
i
enjoy
it
could
use
some
more
toasted
malt
and
a
little
more
hop
flavor
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
just
not
very
interesting
watery
lacking
in
flavor
and
not
deserving
of
a
try
not
a
terrible
marzen
but
one
to
pass
on
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
moderate
tannish
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
sweet
of
malt
caramel
also
noted
taste
is
initially
very
dry
but
then
the
malty
sweetness
kicks
in
the
the
dryness
seems
to
again
take
over
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
liking
at
the
finish
the
dryness
takes
over
from
the
malt
for
a
hoppy
ending
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
ive
enjoyed
better
oktoberfests
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
strong
whats
there
is
very
malty
with
a
breadlike
quality
to
it
the
taste
is
not
challenging
to
the
palate
malty
and
bready
and
slightly
nutty
very
smooth
decent
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
because
there
are
no
off
tastes
there
just
arent
very
many
on
tastes
either
this
is
a
crossover
oktoberfest
that
wont
challenge
your
palate
though
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
for
myself
but
id
drink
a
boatload
of
it
if
brought
to
a
party
dthis
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
light
toast
in
the
malt
and
a
good
hop
balance
very
nice
for
drinking
lots
of
and
not
getting
palate
fatigue
pours
nice
amber
color
average
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
thin
cover
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
hops
playing
with
sweet
notes
make
for
a
nice
seasonal
autumn
smell
the
taste
disappointed
me
not
enough
flavor
the
sweet
caramel
notes
are
there
but
they
are
overpowered
by
bitterness
and
its
not
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
i
look
for
in
ipas
its
harsh
bitterness
that
sticks
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
but
still
quite
decent
mouth
feel
is
light
nicely
carbonated
and
goes
down
smooth
pours
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
over
a
crystal
clear
orange
redrust
liquid
smells
malty
sweet
toasted
grains
and
munich
malt
tastes
sweet
with
chalky
malt
maybe
vienna
a
little
bit
of
dirty
hop
floral
and
a
mild
alcohol
sting
the
ending
is
wet
sweet
it
has
a
nice
toasted
grain
character
throughout
pleasant
well
balanced
tasty
a
little
bit
of
sour
becomes
more
prevalent
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
perhaps
some
phrnols
from
the
toasted
grain
or
maybe
tannins
md
body
and
moderate
carbonation
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
but
its
a
damn
tasty
beer
this
brewery
has
a
tendency
to
go
overboard
from
time
to
time
but
this
is
a
good
beer
id
do
this
anytime
recommended
a
pretty
good
beer
the
malt
profile
is
quite
true
to
style
the
toasty
bready
light
yeast
anc
caramel
tones
are
modestly
present
in
the
nose
and
more
so
in
the
flavor
the
hops
throws
it
out
of
style
overly
agressive
in
the
bittering
and
grassy
flavors
although
i
like
it
its
just
too
much
however
its
what
i
expect
from
flying
dog
a
bit
too
dry
and
rusty
in
the
finish
a
nice
beer
for
the
season
but
dont
look
at
it
as
a
traditional
oktoberfest
body
is
medium
kinda
chewy
and
prickly
with
carbonation
a
modest
effort
not
my
favorite
cheers
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
its
rather
one
dimentional
its
not
a
bad
ofest
just
not
great
hops
character
seems
a
bit
off
to
me
and
the
nose
leaves
much
to
be
desired
body
is
best
enjoy
it
as
much
as
you
can
overall
a
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
brew
maybe
a
little
hoppier
than
is
normal
for
an
oktoberfest
but
that
seems
standard
for
the
american
micro
versions
of
this
style
this
has
been
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
i
recommend
it
highly
ng
the
finish
cleans
out
fairly
well
a
beer
with
planty
of
flavor
just
shy
of
stepping
up
to
the
top
tier
of
marzen
beers
overall
a
tasty
brew
ive
been
generally
satisfied
with
this
companys
brews
but
this
one
seems
just
a
bit
off
the
mark
dogtoberfest
pours
as
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
clear
slight
white
head
its
certainly
got
a
malty
nose
but
it
doesnt
have
the
breadydeepness
that
a
good
oktoberfest
provides
taste
is
caramel
and
toast
with
a
touch
of
graininess
moderate
sweetness
theres
a
bit
more
hops
that
i
would
expect
and
they
tip
the
balance
but
not
too
much
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
a
little
thin
id
call
this
a
midtier
oktoberfest
bender
a
session
brew
one
of
the
better
fd
products
a
decent
enough
ofest
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
nice
fluffy
headthat
took
quite
awhile
to
come
downbig
caramel
notes
in
the
aroma
with
some
pizza
dough
scent
so
far
so
good
on
this
one
well
the
flavor
of
this
doesnt
quite
match
the
aromas
somewhat
dull
in
comparison
some
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
and
some
lingering
spice
but
pretty
bland
well
like
alot
of
flying
dog
brews
this
one
left
me
wanting
a
little
morenice
appearance
and
aroma
but
flat
on
flavor
and
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
theyve
got
a
good
foundation
of
how
to
get
a
octoberfest
out
in
the
market
they
just
gotta
fix
some
blending
issues
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
reddishamber
color
the
aroma
is
a
malty
caramel
with
some
scent
of
burnt
sugar
the
flavor
on
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
in
a
bad
way
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
to
describe
the
flavor
is
rotting
fruit
perhaps
an
apricot
flavor
but
that
is
a
stretch
it
really
does
have
a
pungent
and
sweet
taste
of
spoiled
or
overripened
fruits
the
beer
has
pretty
much
no
hop
flavor
whatsoever
overall
it
is
not
a
great
beer
and
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
ever
again
nice
copper
brew
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
lots
of
bubbles
rising
too
leaves
a
nice
coating
of
lace
good
looking
beer
aroma
sweet
malt
heavy
caramel
coming
thru
light
hops
and
spiceness
if
you
search
taste
big
on
caramel
not
much
on
bready
flavors
carbonation
aids
mouthfeel
nice
burst
of
sweet
caramel
malt
followed
by
a
let
down
finish
lightly
watery
with
a
very
light
hop
spice
finish
first
half
taste
is
nice
but
finish
just
dies
out
for
some
reason
mouthfeel
good
but
finish
is
light
drinkability
is
ok
easy
drinking
but
not
the
best
oktoberfest
around
worth
trying
but
dont
think
i
would
try
again
unless
recipe
changes
flying
dog
has
a
couple
of
really
good
beers
the
rest
just
seem
mediocre
i
had
been
wanted
to
try
this
finally
found
some
the
beer
dispenses
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
luminous
deep
copper
color
with
a
monumental
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
erodes
ever
so
slowly
leaving
a
fine
velum
like
sheet
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
with
the
start
sweet
and
nicely
malt
laden
the
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
stern
in
its
acidity
and
the
hops
personable
in
their
spiciness
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
a
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
better
efforts
ive
had
recently
from
flying
dog
and
a
very
respectable
festbier
on
draught
at
lazy
chameleon
dark
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
decent
lacing
too
mildly
malty
aroma
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
the
body
is
kind
of
weak
with
sweet
malt
and
a
little
nuttiness
and
hops
on
the
back
end
the
finish
is
mostly
sweet
with
a
light
hops
bitterness
here
and
there
as
with
most
of
flying
dogs
beers
the
elements
are
all
there
but
the
execution
falls
short
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
malty
scent
that
boast
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
dry
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
festbier
it
s
not
the
best
ive
had
but
its
definately
not
the
worst
a
good
drinker
not
the
kind
of
beer
to
drink
by
the
pitcher
this
has
quite
a
bit
of
body
and
at
least
for
my
own
preferences
its
a
little
heavy
and
not
easy
to
quaff
more
than
one
overall
a
little
sticky
is
this
really
a
lager
or
an
ale
the
website
claims
that
its
a
lager
but
its
has
somewhat
aleish
characteristics
still
a
good
brew
but
it
just
finishes
a
little
heavy
for
me
seems
an
awful
lot
like
petes
wicked
oktoberfest
this
was
another
beer
i
had
a
chance
to
sample
at
falling
rock
recently
it
poured
a
deep
amber
to
copper
with
a
great
offwhite
head
and
light
lace
light
candy
nose
not
as
much
malt
up
front
as
i
expected
malty
candy
taste
in
the
front
mild
hops
in
the
middle
with
a
light
mouth
feel
and
medium
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
light
on
the
malt
for
this
style
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
liquid
with
a
thick
offwhite
fluffy
head
the
head
disappeared
too
quickly
but
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
some
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
carmel
smell
along
with
a
touch
of
earth
stronger
malt
character
compared
to
some
of
the
other
ofests
i
have
sampled
this
year
nice
carmel
malt
flavor
with
very
little
bitterness
malt
seems
pretty
deep
and
juicy
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
maybe
a
little
rough
not
as
smooth
as
others
but
more
malt
character
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
good
seasonal
clear
deep
ambercopper
color
nice
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
in
the
glass
has
a
light
nutty
and
malty
caramel
aromas
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
clean
tasting
medium
body
a
little
thin
and
semiwatery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
aroma
strong
in
biscuit
malt
kind
of
candycornish
small
yellowish
cream
colored
head
never
amounted
to
much
but
suprisingly
left
some
solid
patches
of
lace
the
beer
level
lowered
transparent
orange
hued
beer
with
a
few
slowly
rising
streams
of
bubbles
the
flavor
is
all
malt
and
fairly
sweet
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
slightly
slick
feel
to
this
fairly
lightbodied
beer
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
theres
nothing
interesting
going
on
taste
sad
soggy
cardboard
meets
the
tongue
meekly
shows
some
flavor
but
its
not
whatwe
want
in
a
marzen
there
is
malt
yes
but
the
body
is
too
dull
insipid
even
leaving
the
flavor
a
very
flat
thing
just
a
dull
thud
in
the
mouth
lordy
not
even
13
through
and
i
wonder
what
im
going
to
do
with
the
rest
of
this
6pack
theres
a
lot
missing
here
a
richer
feel
should
really
be
taking
place
on
the
palate
but
this
one
is
a
dullard
folks
im
hatin
it
but
i
so
didnt
want
to
unpleasant
and
utterly
disappointing
sorry
this
is
a
big
fat
loser
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
amber
color
with
minimal
head
that
leaves
quickly
the
nose
is
sweet
and
a
bit
caramely
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
ofest
beers
but
this
one
is
rather
nice
the
flavor
is
not
big
and
offensive
but
well
balanced
the
beer
is
just
nicely
thick
but
this
sticks
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
wonderful
overall
a
very
nice
offering
12

a
nicely
luminescent
orangebrown
with
a
small

aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
roasted
malt
dominates
the
palate
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
peppery
astringent
character
lingering
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
body
is
a
touch
too
thin
for
a
marzen
like
most
flying
dog
beers
passable
but
not
spectacular
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
germans
but
still
bery
very
good
to
drink
this
is
a
sweet
malty
beer
with
a
pronounced
hop
presence
for
an
octoberfest
i
think
it
is
a
good
choice
for
a
sunny
autumn
day
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
dies
off
quickly

aroma
of
sweetness

malts
reminds
me
of
cooking
sweet
malts
malty
flavor
with
a
strong
caramel
character
sweet
and
somewhat
grainy
flavor
hints
of
a
taste
similar
to
a
nut
brown
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
quite
a
good
representation
of
the
oktoberfest
style
highly
recommended
if
you
like
a
strong
caramel
and
malt
character
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
fairly
enjoyable
even
if
completely
standard
poured
an
attractive
glowing
copperamber
color
but
much
lighter
in
color
than
customary
for
the
style
aroma
was
distinctively
sweet
in
a
candyshop
sort
of
way
while
the
flavor
was
pleasant
with
sweetish
caramel
malt
it
was
too
onedimensional
to
be
of
much
interest
the
mouthfeel
was
also
rather
thin
verdict
oktoberfest

i
popped
the

the

this
is
a
solid
ofest
which
i
will
admit
is
not
my
favorite
beer
style
love
the
addition
of
the
oak
really
impressive
flavor
for
the
slightly
higher
abv
which
is
undetected
try
it
if
you
see
it
tasty
expression
of
the
style
especially
with
using
the
oak
to
smooth
and
polish
the
beer
pretty
good
great
offering
love
the
oak
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
malt
presence
up
front
with
mild
grain
taste
with
subtle
yeast
which
has
a
light
mineral
edge
leading
into
a

from
the
malt
and
slight
herbal

character
with
semidry
finish
which
has
a
light

quality
with
mild

taste
the
atom

is
interesting
and
very
decent
lager
with
nice
drinkability
and
light
malt
sweetness
wout
much
wood
character
but
it
does
contribute
a
slight
lactic
malt
quality
pours

pretty
deep

in

with
a
thin

some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
but
not
much
and
didnt
stick
the
aroma
smelled
soapy
for
some
reason
and
some
caramel
malts
as
well
pretty
much
was
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
wood
after
about
3
more
good
sips
i
poured
it
out
medium
bodied
and
perfect
carbonation
for
the
drain
lol
overall
the
worst
oktoberfest
brew
i
have
had
this
season
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
the
back
of
the
label
said
best
by
010815
this
offering
is
eminently
drinkable
at
a
7
7
abv
overall
this
beer
did
not
live
up
to
the
claim
on
the
bottle
that
it
was
a
full
bodied
lager
in
the
marzen
tradition
it
also
lacked
the
promised
complexity
that
was
supposed
to
come
from
being
aged
in
french
oak
foundries
this
beer
came
across
more
like
a
summer
ale
than
an
oktoberfest
lacked
some
depth
that
i
expect
from
an
oktoberfest
true
to
the
claim
on
the
bottle
it
is
a
unique
twist
on
an
oktoberfest
but
unlike
the
claim
on
the
bottle
it
is
not
unmatched
by
other
imported
oktoberfest
lagers
o
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
if
it
had
a
bit
more
of
the
spice
thats
there
and
needs
a
bit
of
a
hop
note
which
i
found
completely
absent
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
still
easy
to
drink

b
i
am
digging
this
marten
style
beer
the
hoppy
smell
and
taste
of
carmel
and
spice
was
a
unique
treat
also
has
that
german
bite
and
finish
this
isnt
too
bad
its
and
okay
oktoberfest
and
the
oak
aging
definitely
helps
make
it
more
interesting
but
its
still
just
okay
o
overall
a
different
approach
a
bit
high
abv
wise
per
style
deeper
speciality
grain
influence
and
oaky
alcohol
makes
this
a
bit
heavier
to
consume
then
your
typical
lighter
drinking
fair
the
carbonation
is
also
a
bit
zealous
and
overactive
not
a
bad
beer
some
interesting
attributes
from
the
oaky
alcohol
a
bit
outside
the
box
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
malt
flavor
but
i
would
really
like
to
see
a
bit
more
sweetess
just
to
add
character
to
the
malt
and
cut
some
of
the
pungency
of
the
hops
overall
a
good
flavorful
fall
beer
oak
flavors
are
interesting
and
fit
well
with
the
other
flavors
a
good
fall
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
i
really
did
not
like
this
at
all
way
too
sweet
tastecracker
maltpale
malt
subtle
oakiness
and
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
nice

mix

flavors
a
good
match
for
roasted
chicken
easily
one
of
the
best
oktoberfeststyle
beers
ive
ever
had
if
not
one
of
the
best
beer
period
find
it
buy
it
enjoy
it
o
nice
changeup
on
a
classic
style
with
the
oak
foudre
aging
and
the
amped
up
abv
ill
usually
pick
up
a
bottle
or
2
of
this
from
my
local
brewery
for
oktoberfest
just
for
its
uniqueness
not
something
i
would
order
again
but
fans
of
lite
beers
might
like
it
this
is
not
your
typical
sweet
oktoberfest
but
its
still
good
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
not
a
bad
american
style
oktoberfest
very
tasty
beer
i
cant
wait
to
have
on
tap
overall
decent
could
use
more
aroma
overall
this
is
a
splendid
beer
i
want
to
try
it
on
draught
overall
a
nice
version
of
a
marzen
i
think
the
oak
adds
a
nice
touch
this
is
very
drinkable
for
almost
8
i
bought
this
in
a
mixasix
but
im
definitely
thinking
about
picking
up
a
full
6
pack
before
its
out
of
season
this
is
a
nice
oktoberfest
has
a
lactose
quality
similar
to
a
sweet
stout
very
smooth
and
malty
have
had
this
beer
in
previous
years
out
of
a
bottle
and
did
not
like
it
at
all
went
to
the
brewery
today
and
tried
some
fresh
and
had
a
different
experience
this
years
batch
was
released
3
or
4
days
ago
so
it
doesnt
get
much
fresher
very
nice
brew
not
overwhelmed
by
the
oak
which
was
my
previous
experience
very
complex
yet
well
balanced
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
marzen
style
o
enjoyable
beer
no
doubt
i
kinda
wish
id
tried
it
a
little
fresher
septembermid
october
as
carbonation
seemed
a
little
underwhelming
but
the
flavors
and
feel
were
all
good
have
tried
a
few
from
two
brothers
and
generally
like
what
ive
had
id
seek
out
this
beer
again
o
i
love
this
beer
i
really
do
however
i
am
going
to
rate
it
as
its
labeled
and
branded
if
youre
looking
for
a
typical
oktoberfest
you
will
not
enjoy
this
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
reminds
you
of
pumpkins
red
leaves
and
cool
nights
full
of
stars
in
the
sky
you
got
it
overall
a
pretty
decent
spin
on
the
style
nice
caramel
malt
taste
with
a
interesting
mix
of
oak
and
spice
o
this
is
a
unique
marzen
an
imperial
one
at
that
the
wood
nuances
are
splendid
i
only
bought
a
single
but
will
buy
a
few
more
to
further
enjoy
this
one
its
a
bit
strong
for
the
style
but
still
any
easy
drinker
i
like
overall
while
the
oak
is
a
good
idea
this
is
simply
too
sweet
and
boozy
to
be
a
really
good
marzen
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
its
definitely
unique
ive
never
had
a
lager
aged
on
oak
before
not
overly
exciting
but
its
worth
experiencing
overall
drinkability
two
brothers
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
carmel
malt
entry
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
oak
tastes
more
like
an
ale
than
lager
has
a
sweetness
that
suggests
ale
yeast
full
flavors
that
suggest
marzen
but
the
oak
conditioning
gives
a
unique
spin
nice
beer
different
than
an
octoberfest
but
dances
with
the
style
flavorful
satisfying
unique
i
like
it
o
a
great
oktoberfest
with
one
of
the
best
mouthfeels
of
its
style
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
bit
of
oak
and
grass
to
it
not
really
much
aroma
to
it
overall
maybe
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
a
very
faint
grass
flavor
with
a
little
bread
a
little
bit
of
lemon
zest
and
tartness
really
an
odd
beer
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pours
a
pretty
dul
yellowish
brown
not
much
on
the
nose
except
for
some
fruit
apple
taste
there
isnt
much
going
on
here
except
for
a
sourness
at
the
end
that
probably
shouldnt
be
here
umm
oktoberfest
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
normal
not
too
thin
tough
hate
to
give
bad
reviews
but
this
is
overall
a
pretty
avg
beer
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
just
like
the
previous
review
i
am
having
trouble
figuring
out
how
long
this
was
in
oak
cause
it
sure
isnt
there
in
the
taste
o
my
first
two
bros
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
sorry
much
better
oktoberfest
beers
out
there
the
oak
on
this
one
is
lost
imo
would
like
to
try
more
of
there
offerings
i
have
to
admit
im
a
little
let
down
by
this
one
atom
smasher
is
like
a
community
play
a
lot
of
flavors
competing
for
top
billing
but
none
of
them
filling
the
role
they
were
given
with
much
skill
not
sure
if
this
counts
as
an
oktoberfest
beer
cause
if
it
does
it
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
a
traditional
oktoberfest
beer
to
me
but
i
love
brewers
that
experiment
and
make
a
beer
that
is
their
own
use
a
style
as
a
base
and
make
a
good
beer
off
of
that
foundation
this
has
a
much
more
fruity
taste
and
smell
to
it
then
any
other
representation
of
the
style
ive
had
but
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
it
if
you
like
different
beer
and
arent
just
going
for
that
traditional
taste
of
the
style
toasted
sour
bread
with
grapes
make
up
teh
taste
no
oak
or
somewhat
typical
oktoberfest
flaors
at
all
i
hop
this
is
just
a
bad
batch
if
not
this
is
the
sourest
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfestmarzen
ive
ever
had
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
at
all
and
would
bever
recommend
it
i
think
this
is
a
better
offering
than
some
reviews
ive
read
and
there
may
be
a
bad
batch
out
there
judging
from
some
of
the
comments
mine
was
in
perfectly
good
shape
and
i
know
someone
who
might
really
enjoy
one
of
these
o
this
beer
is
alright
a
little
let
down
but
also
have
had
better
oktos
trying
the
atom
smasher
tonight
and
yikes
after
the
first
sip
cant
say
i
am
a
fan
the
appearance
is
blah
the
color
is
a
hazy
tanlight
brown
there
is
virtually
no
head
after
swirling
the
glass
you
get
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
smell
is
bread
sour
dough
almost
sour
mash
smell
the
taste
is
very
tart
almost
like
drinking
liquid
sour
dough
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
tough
high
abv
masked
by
bready
tart
soury
mash
taste
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
im
wonderinghoping
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
batch
typically
two
brothers
is
a
solid
brewery
this
one
in
my
mind
missed
the
mark
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
recedes
quickly
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
plenty
of
bread
and
a
light
bit
of
caramel
faint
hops
the
flavor
is
okay
having
too
much
of
a
grain
character
with
slight
tannins
and
a
mild
tartness
light
body
with
bread
crust
and
modest
carbonation
decent
enough
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
oak
is
well
integrated
theres
a
caramel
apple
flavor
thats
big
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
in
the
dry
woody
aftertaste
a
light
toasty
malt
sweetness
comes
through
also
along
with
a
general
breadiness
easy
and
light
carbonation
still
a
traditional
oktoberfest
in
my
mind
with
a
unique
twist
the
oak
character
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
dominate
enjoyed
trying
this
and
i
hope
to
see
more
oakaged
beers
from
2
bros
in
the
future
o
the
7
7
is
well
hidden
in
both
flavor
and
body
overall
impressions
are
pretty
lackluster
i
had
some
high
hopes
for
this
from
the
small
local
but
its
nothing
really
special
as
pointed
out
above
the
winy
character
of
this
beer
isnt
true
oktoberfest
in
style
and
just
a
little
distracting
if
this
was
labeled
an
amber
ale
the
characters
wouldnt
be
off
overall
not
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
interesting
i
just
wish
the
aromas
and
flavors
played
out
a
bit
stronger
this
was
good
but
i
remembered
last
years
to
be
better
than
this
it
just
wasnt
fully
working
for
me
and
im
glad
i
had
it
off
tap
rather
than
paying
for
a
6
pack
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
it
was
pretty
average
across
the
board
overall
im
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
oktoberfests
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
enjoyable
a
solid
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
fall
months
ogreat
marzen
interesting
that
i
got
the
oak
from
the
smell
and
its
interesting
for
a
marzen
to
utilize
oak
but
i
will
say
i
enjoyed
the
brew
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
a
marzen
ive
had
as
of
late
this
was
an
interesting
oktoberfest
to
have
on
tap
certainly
unique
in
terms
of
flavor
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
either
on
tap
or
bottle
form
overall
this
is
a
decent
marzen
beer
the
oak
adds
an
interesting
component
that
keeps
me
interested
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
one
of
my
favorite
marzens
now
i
can
see
me
buying
quite
a
few
more
six
packs
this
season
o
my
first
fall
beer
of
the
long
awaited
for
season
not
a
bad
start
something
to
try
although
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
another
6er
with
so
many
others
to
try
the
nice
thing
though
is
it
came
in
12
oz
6
packs
this
year
compared
to
last
years
375
i
think
though
im
gonna
try
this
one
out
again
soon
and
rethink
my
review
d
very
drinkable
because
of
its
balance
and
mouthfeel
two
brothers
atom
smasher
oktoberfest
style
lager
is
not
as
bad
as
the
final
score
will
indicate
that
said
it
isnt
a
smashing
success
and
wont
be
a
repeat
purchase
too
bad
the
oak
didnt
add
more
to
the
positive
side
of
the
ledger
this
one
pours
a
muddy
dirty
pumpkin
with
the
cloudiness
of
a
belgian
it
has
a
great
deal
of
sediment
it
smells
sweet
funky
and
has
some
good
spice
to
it
it
tastes
really
good
its
very
fruit
and
has
some
interesting
spice
to
it
it
almost
has
some
spicy
orange
to
it
its
not
a
typical
oktoberfest
thats
for
sure
it
drinks
very
smoothly
and
has
a
good
soft
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
drinks
well
im
really
liking
it
nice
light
feel
with
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
with
above
average
flavor
i
read
somewhere
that
this
beer
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
but
i
could
not
taste
it
in
the
beer
at
all
having
just
done
a
beer
tasting
featuring
some
of
the
best
examples
of
the
oktoberfest
style
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
think
id
be
trying
this
one
again
its
not
bad
i
just
believe
that
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
märzen
style
out
there
22oz
bottle
into
an
over
sized
paulaner
stein
wow
this
glass
is
huge
d
i
think
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
probably
something
i
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
being
from
a
local
brewery
but
it
is
not
really
doing
anything
for
me
standard
fair
for
an
octoberfest
td
good
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
im
usually
impressed
with
the
two
brothers
products
and
though
this
wasnt
my
favorite
it
still
was
pretty
good
and
did
not
disappoint
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
id
be
more
apt
to
buy
this
if
it
were
available
in
a
six
pack
the
tannic
finish
helps
round
out
the
syrupy
sweetness
of
the
beer
im
not
real
into
marzens
but
this
is
a
good
beer
a
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
appears
a
slightly
clouded
deep
caramel
amber
with
a
big
billowing
cream
colored
head
fine
speckled
lacing
scattered
in
my
liter
paulaner
krug
aroma
has
some
nutty
caramel
sweetness
tart
cider
like
notes
in
the
background
alot
of
bread
dough
malt
driven
tones
without
much
herbal
hops
to
balance
things
out
flavor
super
sweet
almost
sugary
lacks
the
balance
that
a
nice
toasted
bread
malty
herbal
hopped
ofest
has
i
get
it
this
isnt
a
straight
up
marzen
this
is
a
boozed
up
maltier
version
of
all
the
two
brothers
beers
ive
tasted
this
is
my
least
favorite
mouthfeel
becomes
cloying
especially
once
youre
half
way
done
not
my
style
of
beer
ive
had
imperial
ofests
that
worked
with
higher
alcohol
the
unbalanced
malthop
ratio
is
killing
me
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
almost
too
heavy
tickles
the
back
of
my
throat
and
nares
drinkability
overall
is
really
limited
i
wouldnt
even
suggest
a
bomber
ive
been
there
and
done
that
no
need
to
revisit
this
drinks
pretty
light
and
alchohol
was
not
detectable
a
good
fall
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
drinkability
good
not
great
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
several
of
these
while
hanging
out
in
my
leiderhosen
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
have
another
one
d
i
was
pretty
damn
happy
this
beer
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
malty
and
this
really
delivered
some
of
its
minor
defects
were
that
it
was
a
little
sweet
on
the
finish
and
it
didnt
look
polished
otherwise
this
was
rock
solid
and
id
drink
it
again
medium
body
decent
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
oak
does
not
show
very
much
somewhat
disappointing
sweetness
overload
d
this
is
not
my
idea
of
a
drinkable
brew
the
sweetness
is
nearly
cloying
and
it
doesnt
feature
what
an
oktoberfest
should
be
the
oak
aging
of
this
beer
is
virtually
undetectable
im
starting
to
question
two
bros
use
of
the
oak
foudres
in
theory
it
sounds
like
a
solid
idea
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
doesnt
translate
to
a
better
beer
d
i
wish
that
two
brothers
new
oak
foudres
would
impart
a
little
more
flavor
on
their
beers
this
is
something
i
could
probably
have
another
of
this
fall
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
too
often
d
a
decent
oktoberfest
with
the
oak
aging
giving
it
a
little
character
lighter
body
lends
to
easy
drinking
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
will
necessary
seek
out
again
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
the
carbonation
is
way
too
low
im
not
happy
about
this
aspect
as
i
think
better
carb
would
have
brought
some
pep
into
what
is
coming
off
as
a
dead
beer
distracting
and
certainly
under
the
necessary
feel
of
octoberfest
beers
while
this
was
a
unique
angle
and
started
off
with
some
nice
added
depth
i
feel
this
beer
fell
short
its
drinkable
but
too
flat
and
sticky
to
be
enjoyable
please
carb
this
next
year
get
those
carbon
and
oxygen
atoms
to
smash
and
make
bubbles
probably
worth
a
try
for
the
die
hard
marzen
fan
but
not
worth
another
try
for
me
delicious
ill
have
another
the
7
never
really
comes
out
in
any
negative
way
it
is
well
done
for
being
one
of
the
highest
percents
i
think
i
might
just
go
purchase
one
7
is
cheap
and
surprise
my
buddy
this
weekend
with
it
d
one
is
enough
fix
the
carbonation
and
this
opinion
might
change
got
this
bottle
on
a
whim
from
my
local
binnys
it
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
thin
quickly
receding
white
head
the
smell
is
very
nice
aside
from
the
malt
which
there
is
strong
smell
of
there
is
the
smell
of
orange
zest
pepper
and
what
i
believe
to
be
an
almost
woodsy
mesquite
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
damn
good
too
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
season
now
i
say
that
with
the
caveat
that
my
preference
is
to
the
sweeter
more
american
oktoberfests
having
said
that
the
flavor
is
sweet
malts
on
the
front
with
hints
of
smokiness
the
aftertaste
isnt
much
with
the
distinct
bittering
and
hints
of
cinnamon
it
is
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
a
definite
recommendation
if
you
have
the
opportunity
turn
out
your
pockets
i
see
atoms
good
times
with
old
father
burns
this
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazed
dark
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
creamcoloured
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
mandarin
orange
syrup
yes
just
the
syrup
rye
bread
hot
cinnamon
dentynestyle
homes
and
a
touch
o
white
flowers
it
may
be
the
acid
but
i
can
taste
the
colours
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
the
citrus
and
sweet
bready
malts
doubleteaming
my
buds
quite
nicely
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
ofest
one
of
the
better
ive
had
thus
far
this
season
an
interesting
interpretation
if
not
near
style
overall
a
good
beer
just
dont
expect
to
drink
a
few
liters
and
be
able
to
find
your
way
home
without
considerable
help
drinkability
is
so
so
i
split
the
bomber
and
that
was
plenty
for
me
this
fall
sour
flavors
and
no
carbonation
the
search
continues
for
a
great
oktoberfest
drinkability
this
beer
drinks
great
nice
to
see
two
brothers
put
a
lager
in
the
foundres
my
only
quip
would
be
the
carbonation
even
with
that
its
a
solid
oktoberfest
pours
lighter
goldtan
than
expected
for
the
style
aroma
is
slightly
off
a
mix
of
some
malt
and
a
little
skunky
id
think
i
got
a
bad
batch
if
other
reviews
werent
also
quite
low
taste
is
boring
feel
is
overcarbonated
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
lacked
any
head
was
not
super
flavorful
and
was
a
little
bit
too
watery
and
märzenoktoberfest
beers
are
supposed
to
be
fullbodied
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
oktoberfest
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
dissipating
white
head
that
leaves
very
light
lacing
nose
of
caramel
and
bread
flavors
follow
a
standard
oktoberfest
with
sweet
breaded
malts
light
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
barely
detectable
hop
in
the
background
light
mouth
feel
decent
for
what
it
is
but
not
a
lot
of
the
more
robust
flavors
associated
with
the
style
decent
this
was
not
what
i
expected
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
smoothness
and
flavor
definitely
a
new
seasonal
favorite
terrible
that
this
tastes
to
me
like
the
shandy
not
sure
if
they
put
this
on
the
same
line
or
what
but
man
do
i
get
a
concentrated
lemonade
thing
in
here
which
in
any
light
does
not
belong
in
an
octoberfest
lager
the
look
is
incredible
frothy
soapy
tall
lasting
pure
snow
white
head
with
beautiful
retention
and
lace
as
it
drinks
i
mean
it
could
not
look
any
better
for
what
it
is
with
the
pale
copper
beer
clear
underneath
a
little
light
maybe
and
definitely
light
in
malt
on
the
flavor
especially
compared
to
is
german
counterparts
there
just
isnt
much
base
to
this
thin
and
watery
and
oddly
citrus
forward
but
not
from
hops
tangy
but
not
quite
tannic
nice
because
its
light
but
bad
because
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
style
is
supposed
to
no
caramel
or
anything
like
that
not
german
cereals
and
no
yeast
profile
at
all
doesnt
even
seem
like
a
lager
the
tang
of
the
shandy
lasts
through
the
finish
and
i
would
never
guess
this
is
an
octoberfest
beer
in
a
blind
tasting
fine
for
all
day
drinking
though
i
guess
if
you
dont
know
what
its
supposed
to
taste
like
i
was
unimpressed
overall
pretty
shite
definitely
not
worth
picking
up
support
another
brewery
if
you
want
a
good
marzen
this
is
all
talk
and
no
delivery
overall
this
is
pretty
good
not
the
best
leinnies
has
produced
but
not
bad
mouth
med
to
lighter
bod

oktoberfest
is
a
decent
marzenstyle
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
taste
but
it
doesnt
water
down
the
flavor
of
the
beer
all
the
way
great
taste
exceptional
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
overall
this
is
an
average
oktoberfest
it
is
lighter
than
some
oktoberfests
this
is
a
good
beer
to
ease
into
an
oktoberfest
but
others
are
better
needs
more
flavor
a
little
too
much
on
the
caramel
flavor
for
me
the
mixture
of
caramel
and
malt
really
break
out
when
you
first
taste
this
my
problem
is
all
the
other
flavors
that
are
also
trying
to
break
through
just
too
much
going
on
here
i
think
this
is
a
damn
fine
oktoberfest
beer
yes
as
others
have
noted
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
like
most
beers
in
this
style
however
the
flavor
is
great
it
has
a
great
head
and
looks
beautiful
in
a
glass
if
i
lived
in
colder
climes
i
might
have
an
issue
with
the
lightnesswateryness
of
this
brand
but
if
your
october
has
temps
in
the
high
80s
and
90s
this
beer
is
refreshing
its
the
best
cheap
octoberfest
i
can
find
anyway
better
than
sam
adams
for
sure
an
average
octoberfest
it
had
a
funky
ester
going
on
almost
as
if
it
were
brewed
with
an
english
ale
yeast
at
a
high
temp
kinda
watery
maltiness
and
color
were
decent
o
not
terrible
but
not
worth
having
again
maybe
useful
for
people
who
are
new
to
the
style
but
i
am
sure
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
sample
at
the
lodge
mild
easy
drinking
beer
some
grain
flavors
light
tan
body
its
ok
overall
not
the
best
not
the
worst
drinkable
cheers
too
watery
than
what
is
to
be
expected
from
a
marzen
im
with
wiscokid
920
lacks
any
kind
of
maltiness
for
mouth
feel
looks
and
smells
good
just
needs
a
name
change
not
an
oktoberfest
beer
pours
a
bright
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
earthy
and
nutty
scents
the
taste
was
very
mellow
but
had
some
really
nice
marzen
style
taste
to
it
with
a
lot
of
nutty
notes
in
the
beginning
with
a
very
clean
finish
very
nice
albeit
simple
a
bit
light
bodied
a
little
watered
down
but
onpoint
as
far
as
the
characteristic
oktoberfest
flavors
like
a
nice
common
its
the
only
oktoberfest
the
711
carries
orange
amber
with
a
natural
white
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
toasted
nearly
roasted
caramel
malt
with
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
kisses
a
nice
dry
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
good
american
style
marzen
a
decent
offering
of
an
oktoberfest
has
the
traditional
toasted
and
caramel
malts
slight
breadynuttiness
a
decent
enough
hop
bitterness
the
biggest
knock
i
have
is
the
mouthfeel
its
just
not
up
to
par
too
thin
and
watery
the
classic
aroma
and
flavor
profile
is
there
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
type
of
body
necessary
for
the
style
at
least
in
my
book
overall
a

for

i
probably
wont
get
this
brew
again

an
abv
of

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
flavor
and
grains
nothing
special
so
far
now
for
the
taste
it
is
smooth
with
some
burnt
grains
oktoberfest
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
leinenkugels
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
3
17
its
a
toss
up
if
id
ever
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
its
bad
but
its
not
very
good
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
friends
but
this
is
still
worth
a
try
nice
taste
not
too
bold
would
drink
again
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
body
with
a
one
finger
white
head
very
nice
and
true
to
style
scents
of
rich
sweet
malt
a
light
toasted
aroma
and
a
very
faint
citrus
overall
impression
is
of
a
nice
clean
oktoberfest
aroma
though
the
citrus
is
an
odd
touch
but
not
unpleasant
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
rich
malty
sweetness
moving
into
a
nice
toasted
malt
character
with
an
extremely
faint
touch
of
lemonade
middle
continues
these
flavors
but
gets
a
little
drier
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
alcohol
present
finish
is
mediumdry
with
a
nice
presence
of
toasted
malt
overall
impression
is
of
a
clean
malty
flavor
that
is
balanced
between
rich
malt
and
toasted
malt
the
lemonade
flavors
faintly
in
the
background
are
not
traditional
but
not
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
nice
and
very
true
to
style
overall
this
a
decent
example
of
an
oktoberfest
it
stays
mostly
to
style
in
most
respects
and
what
it
does
differently
is
not
unpleasant
and
works
with
the
flavor
profile
and
aroma
nothing
spectacular
but
good
all
around
overall
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
but
worth
a
try
o
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
have
many
of
these
it
just
seems
like
a
watered
down
version
of
traditional
oktoberfests
a
drinkable
example
of
the
style
no
complaints
i
figured
the
oktoberfest
beer
i
could
make
my
first
would
be
from
my
favorite
mainstreambrewer
leinenkugel
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
not
really
knowing
how
an
oktoberfest
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
i
went
in
with
no
expectations
and
came
out
with
a
great
beer
full
of
pleasant
caramel
malt
character
and
mildly
bitter
and
refreshing
crispness
keep
em
coming
leinie
and
ill
keep
drinking
overall
a
decent
brew
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
its
worth
a
try
i
think
it
is
a
little
better
than
we
have
given
it
credit
for
here
but
it
isnt
anything
to
really
jump
around
about
slightly
above
average
not
bad
at
all
it
has
a
nice
warming
taste
and
feel
to
it
theres
a
caramel
malty
trait
to
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
however
it
was
certainly
enjoyable
there
are
better
out
there
pours
a
pretty
copper
in
color
with
a
1finger
foamy
off
white
head
but
doesnt
last
too
long
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
tiny
streaming
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
not
over
carbonated
the
aroma
is
of
some
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
doesnt
have
a
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
though
not
as
bad
as
some
others
make
it
out
to
be
really
overall
this
is
a
midtier
american
oktoberfest
that
is
widely
available
in
the
midwest
i
would
likely
choose
sam
adams
oktoberfest
over
this
if
i
was
buying
large
quantities
of
this
beer
style
as
the
nose
and
malt
flavors
are
a
little
better
than
the
leinies
offering
pales
in
comparison
to
the
german
examples
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
bits
of
lacing
aroma
of
malt
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
fruit
and
citrus
taste
of
malt
some
caramel
sweetness
mild
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
fairly
light
body
smooth
but
a
bit
short
on
flavor
decent
beer
but
hoped
for
a
bit
more
character
o
its
ok
by
me
c
overall
a
solid
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
nice
and
malty
and
nicely
balanced
with
hops
good
quaff
i
picked
this
up
in
a
mix
and
match
section
at
fresh
market
after
one
drink
it
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
a
lite
version
of
an
octoberfest
beer
tasted
watered
down
very
disappointed
as
leinenkugels
usually
puts
out
good
beer
even
yuengling
tasted
better
than
this
i
was
expecting
much
more
having
seen
a
lot
of
marketing
for
this
brewerys
beers
but
i
feel
let
down
on
the
hype
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toast
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
pretty
boring
and
forgettable
for
the
style
o
this
beer
tastes
like
a
lite
version
of
a
german
oktoberfestit
has
the
proper
aromas
and
flavors
but
seems
to
be
watered
down
overall
an
average
marzen
overall
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
it
is
drinkable
and
appropriate
for
a
nice
fall
day
o
the
best
part
i
drank
it
without
incident
sadly
that
just
means
this
one
is
no
good
even
if
it
was
offered
to
me
freely
id
think
long
and
hard
about
drinking
this
again
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
that
is
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
its
alright
but
noting
super
exceptional
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
send
it
back
if
i
ordered
it
but
id
ask
what
other
ambers
they
had
before
i
ordered
it
again
lacks
the
character
i
look
for
in
an
oktoberfest
i
think
a
larger
malt
bill
could
help
o
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
if
not
very
remarkable
overall
a
decent
märzen
not
the
best
of
its
kind
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
poured
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
at
mcmichaels
pub
gloucester
city
nj
o
ok
might
have
one
once
in
a
while
this
beer
is
way
good
for
the
money
but
you
can
tell
that
its
the
cheapest
oktoberfest
you
can
get
your
hands
on
in
the
us
its
got
nice
lacing
but
the
head
doesnt
last
long
the
colours
even
almost
copper
but
on
the
lighter
side
you
can
taste
a
mild
sourness
common
in
cheap
lagers
it
kind
of
tastes
like
if
you
took
a
good
marzen
and
poured
some
cheap
walgreens
lager
into
it
still
it
preserves
a
lot
of
the
things
i
like
about
marzens
which
are
some
of
my
favourite
beers
fall
is
my
favourite
season
for
beer
its
got
a
rich
toasty
flavour
and
a
really
nice
blend
of
malt
flavours
cheaptasting
malt
but
still
very
well
blended
it
really
tastes
like
a
marzen
the
hops
too
taste
genuinely
like
the
hops
a
marzen
should
have
theyre
barely
there
just
as
they
should
be
but
what
flavour
profile
they
provide
is
more
than
just
a
bittering
agent
they
add
a
bit
of
flavour
themselves
this
is
a
great
buy
for
the
money
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
left
the
impression
of
eating
fresh
baked
bread
on
a
cold
autumn
evening
to
me
considering
the
style
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
its
not
overpowering
or
watery
its
just
a
good
sessionable
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
buying
again
atmosphere
is
okay
decent

no
real

though

is

with
a

of
a

and

with

overall
this

an
okay
quaff
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
leinenkugels
beers
but
not
this
one
i
dont
thick
they
hit
the
mark
when
it
came
to
a
marzen
beer
a
bit
disappointing
overall
a
reliable
seasonal
beverage
that
i
would
go
back
to
not
the
best
in
the
category
but
it
does
not
pretend
to
be
something
that
its
not
easy
to
drink
would
enjoy
best
with
friends
on
a

not
a

but
not
one
of
my
favorites
either
still
i
think
its
worth
trying
got
this
as
a
single
at
my
local
kroger
i
remember
trying
a
few
octoberfest
brews
last
fall
and
i
recall
that
my
impression
of
leinies
was
quite
favorable
one
very
popular
brand
in
particular
i
found
to
be
quite
hard
to
drink
my
favorable
impression
of
leinies
version
is
strengthened
with
this
purchase
which
is
the
first
octyfest
that
ive
seen
for
sale
in
my
town
pours
out
to
a
halfinch
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
but
permanent
foam
layer
not
much
lacing
color
is
ambergold
aroma
is
toasty
munich
malt
with
a
bit
of
grassyspicy
hops
flavor
is
maltforward
and
toasty
as
expected
but
not
as
round
and
sweet
as
a
typical
ofest
possibly
due
to
it
being
about
1
5
lower
than
the
typical
abv
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
slightly
astringent
overall
a
solid
brew
but
without
the
kick
i
was
expecting
my
favorite
fall
beer
but
its
out
way
too
early
beer
cola
truthfully
its
the
only
october
beer
ive
ever
had
i
drank
coors
light
exclusively
for
twelve
years
then
grew
up
by
trying
new
beers
every
once
and
awhile
im
sipping
one
now
and
sad
that
it
will
be
in
the
80s
tomorrow
overall
a
nice
brew
even
on
a
hot
day
i
would
enjoy
this
oktoberfest
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
this
year
i
would
have
liked
to
put
it
off
a
bit
but
couldnt
resist
beer
is
a
decent
enough
oktoberfest
i
would
certainly
drink
enough
in
the
fall
to
fulfill
my
fair
share
the
beer
is
best
enjoyed
out
of
a
bottle
particularly
good
out
of
a
munich
glass
a
flavorful
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
on
a
saturday
afternoon
this
beer
in
appearance
was
a
light
brown
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
overall
the
smell
just
smelled
like
fall
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
possibly
nutmeg
in
it
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
time
although
i
drank
it
in
the
spring
time
i
employed
a
crack
inverted
glug
to
get
things
started
and
it
produced
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
as
a
result
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
had
a
honeylike
lager
sweetness
along
with
a
breadiness
initially
and
warming
i
began
to
perceive
the
caramel
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
there
was
a
pronounced
effervescence
due
to
all
of
the
carbonation
noted
earlier
taste
was
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
i
really
liked
the
way
that
the
malts
interacted
so
that
it
had
a
sweetish
bready
flavor
initially
and
then
took
on
a
sweeter
caramel
taste
on
the
finish
i
also
noted
a
slight
grassiness
perhaps
hallertau
hops
fall
seasonal
hell
its
a
germanstyle
marzen
and
its
damn
close
to
march
as
it
stands
i
would
like
to
see
this
released
more
often
and
if
not
stash
some
away
for
late
winter
it
is
just
that
good
very
good
oktoberfest
brew
reminds
me
of
holiday
in
munich
very
festive
tasting
beer
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
slightly
citrus
bite
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
cannot
handle
real
german
beer
that
has
a
high
abv
perfect
for
beginners
in
the
world
of
oktoberfest
brews
overall
drinkability
a
middle
of
the

to
drink

are
better
oktoberfest
out
there
not
a
bad
offering
just
an
average
one
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
red
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
some
grain
but
not
much
at
all
beer
has
some
caramely
and
slight
chocolate
notes
in
the
dark
roasted
malt
but
tastes
watered
down
beer
is
carbonated
fine
and
goes
down
really
well
definitely
sessionable
overall
an
average
beer
pours
out
a
nice
dark
golden
brown
color
thats
crystal
clear
and
filled
with
mild
carbonation
its
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
its
got
some
really
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
with
hints
of
pumpkin
wheat
and
mild
hops
some
grass
and
herbal
smells
come
through
from
time
to
time
crisp
on
the
tongue
at
first
it
mellows
out
as
it
spreads
throughout
your
mouth
it
has
some
nice
wheat
flavors
mild
grass
notes
when
you
swallow
but
thats
all
i
get
fro
it
it
is
light
bodied
but
good
overall
oktoberfest
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
lite
head
there
is
a
slight
malty
aroma
there
is
a
crisp
light
malty
taste
not
to
watery
a
bit
lighter
a
little
carbonated
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
marzen
a
bit
lighter
but
still
rather
enjoyable
overall
this
comes
off
as
just
a
simple
marzen
but
its
easy
drinking
and
i
could
drink
this
again
without
discomfort
no
problem
o
there
were
hundreds
of
these
at
my
local
foodtown
in
large
metal
bins
all
for
1
a
can
its
a
simple
straight
forward
beer
and
great
for
the
price
id
have
another
for
a
dollar
overall
2
5
an
average
beer
i
would
not
go
out
and
try
to
track
this
down
but
this
is
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
you
will
ever
drink
it
is
maerzenesque
but
if
there
are
other
oktoberfest
options
available

i
thought
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
marzen
there
was
nothing
really
off
or
offensive
about
this
beer
but
it
also
seemed
to
lack
that
certain
something
that
brings
all
the
flavors
together

beers
are

so
this
is
a
great

for
beer
leinies
and
point
are
the
first
ones
on
the
shelves
here
and
i
just
had
to
pick
them
up
both
are
a
fairly
average
oktoberfest
leinies
is
a
hair
more
spicy
and
point
is
a
hair
more
earthy
truthfully
they
both
are
very
similar
and
i
cant
tell
them
from
each
other
unless
they
are
side
by
side
i
cant
wait
for
the
other
brands
to
start
showing
up
ill
be
getting
more
of
both
leinies
and
point
until
ngs
staghorn
hits
the
shelves
both
really
should
be
scored
higher
than
i

one

for
me
wisconsinalitysep
21
ive
been
buzz
sawing
through
all
the
oktoberfests
i
can
get
my
hands
on
and
figured
i
better
give
this
one
a
try
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
bright
burnt
orange
rather
clear
with
tiny
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
of
my
glass
generous
beige
head
rests
atop
my
beer
after
receding
there
is
a
tiny
amount
of
lace
left
behind
the
aroma
is
malty
and
pronounced
some
sweetness
a
touch
of
breadiness
by
far
the
strongest
nose
ive
found
so
far
in
the
style
the
flavor
is
spot
on
for
the
style
nice
smooth
malt
with
a
pleasant
hop
bite
to
round
it
out
a
wheaty
biscuity
flavor
is
strong
in
the
finish
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
declare
a
winner
in
the
race
for
top
marzen
i
have
a
few
more
to
try
so
i
cant
crown
it
yet
but
leinenkugels
has
wowed
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
this
is
what
im
looking
for
in
an
oktoberfest
overall
not
inyourface
by
any
means
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
to
be
sure
this
is
an
easytodrink
beer
that
is
refreshing
so
i
scored
it
well
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
isnt
going
to
challenge
for
oktoberfest
supremacy
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
velvety
and
a
little
watery
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
this
beer
is
not
the
greatest
mazen
beer
it
sure
is
a
leinens
beer
mediocre
d
a
solid
example
of
the
marzen
style
one
of
the
better
leines
offerings
out
there
6pks
of
this
will
not
last
long
at
all
german
style
marzen
pours
light
copper
with
medium
carbonation
the
smell
told
me
lager
right
away
not
very
complex
the
taste
surprised
me
a
bit
it
was
very
fresh
and
surprisingly
a
fair
amount
of
hop
flavor
overall
mouthfeel
was
light
but
refreshing
i
can
taste
the
malts
too
the
hops
and
malts
are
equal
but
not
very
strong
overall
light
but
easily
drinkable
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
wont
turn
it
down
d
a
solid
brew
and
definitely
the
best
leineys
ive
tried
yet
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
very
approachable
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
for
a
wide
audience
like
my
friends
definitely
a
safe
option
beer
when
options
are
limited
a
solid
choice
drinkability
pretty
good
ive
never
been
to
impressed
with
leninkugels
but
this
was
very
drinkable
and
does
well
in
a
lot
of
what
i
like
in
a
maerzen
would
drink
again
d
okay
gotta
say
this
is
a
very
nice
quaffer
the
roastiness
is
not
tostyle
for
an
okto
but
its
not
distracting
its
not
the
best
okto
ive
ever
sampled
but
its
far
from
the
worst
worth
a
go
for
a
lazy
afternoon
with
friends
this
brew
has
a
tiny
head
but
pours
into
the
glass
with
shining
copper
color
and
gold
highlights
its
beautiful
through
the
right
glass
until
your
done
the
smell
is
not
my
favorite
part
a
little
bit
of
hoppy
yeast
and
toasty
caramel
andor
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
quick
a
tastebuds
encompassing
flash
of
hoppy
caramel
and
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
is
just
barely
thick
enough
for
the
style
and
it
doesnt
leave
anything
lying
around
as
long
as
im
not
in
any
sort
of
hurry
i
could
drink
it
all
night
well
i
have
to
agree
with
the
general
consensus
of
reviewers
not
awful
but
quite
bland
and
not
a
good
introduction
for
anyone
to
the
marzen
style
appearance
ok
not
as
copperyamber
as
i
would
expect
and
looks
a
bit
light
smell
is
decent
slight
honey
with
good
caramel
aroma
taste
disappointment
kinda
metallicy
but
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
fine
i
guess
but
not
something
id
want
to
keep
going
for
its
a
decent
beer
just
not
the
best
marzen
a
decent
beer
but
also
very
bland
at
the
same
time
i
think
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
the
style
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
but
not
at
all
a
good
representative
of
the
octoberfest
style
too
flat
and
lacking
any
complexity
of
flavor
avoid
dgood
enough
but
attempts
at
german
styles
should
be
left
to
the
germans
not
the
worst
beer
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
match
the
style
doubtful
i
would
have
this
again
beer
pours
a
crips
clear
amber
color
there
is
a
one
finger
head
that
last
and
gives
way
to
a
decent
lacing
the
overall
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
breads
cinnamon
and
spice
the
taste
is
very
roasty
with
the
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spice
coming
through
the
carbonation
is
slightly
high
the
overall
drinkability
is
high
it
is
a
good
oktoberfest
but
not
the
best
drinkabilitity
ultimately
depends
on
how
much
you
like
the
flavors
if
they
dont
agree
with
you
then
you
may
not
want
to
partake
in
more
than
one
however
if
your
in
the
mood
for
it
its
pretty
damn
good
i
liked
it
and
id
take
another
overall
the
drinkability
was
average
it
tasted
like
an
average
beer
with
a
touch
of
a
darker
beer
but
not
necessarily
an
oktoberfest
styled
beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
brew
was
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
poor
and
the
lacing
soso
the
aroma
was
of
big
toasted
malt
with
a
dry
grain
background
and
some
light
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
flavors
were
at
first
dominated
by
the
roasted
malt
but
some
hops
did
show
up
to
offer
balance
eventually
the
graininess
was
again
there
along
with
some
wood
notes
especially
on
the
finish
semibitter
and
semiacidic
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
due
to
the
carbonation
being
too
high
and
the
body
being
lightmedium
a
bad
combination
drinkability
is
average
this
is
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
it
ranks
above
becks
but
far
below
saranc
its
a
decent
beer
if
your
in
the
season
but
theres
definately
better
out
there
drinkability
is
good
though
given
the
choice
in
the
month
of
october
id
move
onto
a
different
selection
than
double
up
this
one
i
am
a
fan
of
marsen
beers
i
had
a
few
an
this
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
heavy
light
on
the
palete
pours
a
light
amberbrown
color
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
mild
malt
aroma
mild
malt
flavors
slightly
harsh
bitter
finish
that
leads
to
a
nutty
almond
aftertaste
a
light
vienna
not
a
bad
octoberfest
probably
lienies
best
beer
ever
non
big
eddy
d
this
can
be
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
light
and
not
too
strong
d
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
but
it
was
not
too
representative
of
a
good
oktoberfest
could
have
used
a
little
more
work
in
order
to
make
it
a
better
beer
overall
this
beer
has
the
carbonation
just
right
all
leinies
needs
to
do
is
crank
up
the
malthopcaramel
characteristics
of
this
beer
and
it
would
be
outstanding
nothing
impressive
about
this
one
at
all
but
its
everywhere
i
dont
get
it
d
im
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
but
its
very
weak
in
taste
and
body
nothing
to
offend
on
by
any
means
and
good
session
beer
no
doubt
but
i
was
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
from
leinenkugel

d
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
earthy
flavors
really
rubbed
me
wrong
nothing
horridly
wrong
i
just
dont
like
the
recipe
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
in
fact
it
may
be
one
of
the
better
leines
ive
tasted
now
that
is
not
saying
that
this
is
a
particularly
good
octoberfest
but
it
is
a
decent
slightly
malted
up
slightly
carmelized
lager
beer
with
a
decent
balance
of
hops
some
nice
cracked
grains
and
an
earthy
quality
that
isnt
bad
if
you
rate
it
as
a
marzan
this
beer
will
fall
way
short
on
its
own
its
not
bad
this
is
amply
carbonated
is
refreshing
does
not
have
any
off
tastes
or
some
cheaply
added
adjunct
characteristic
of
other
leines
ive
had
this
is
a
solid
beer
not
complex
but
respectable
nonetheless
there
is
a
slight
mouth
puckering
dryness
in
the
finish
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
slight
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
perked
up
from
some
nice
hop
balance
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
somewhat
creamy
head
with
decent
retention
smell
isnt
the
best
a
very
very
strong
biscuit
smell
with
a
bit
of
dry
malt
i
dont
know
how
but
somehow
this
beer
just
smells
dry
taste
is
average
a
chalky
malty
backbone
with
some
bread
and
biscuit
flavor
a
slight
touch
of
burnt
grain
as
well
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
and
a
bit
fizzy
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
i
didnt
mind
the
6
pack
but
probably
wont
be
going
back
for
another
this
beer
is
a
pale
orange
color
that
looks
terribly
overcarbonated
it
smells
weak
and
of
watered
down
rice
malt
taste
is
quite
bare
too
very
light
and
macroesque
perhaps
a
slight
bit
of
malt
flavor
at
the
end
but
perhaps
thats
the
remnants
of
the
beer
i
had
in
this
before
and
did
not
properly
wash
out
not
a
good
beer

a

not
up

i

and
it

it

be

its
very
basic
and
smooth

for
the

i
like
it

just
not
a

definitely
not
a

tastes

out

there
was

nothing

it

that
is
dry
with
some
faint

the

it

your

would

sam

does
much

ive
tried
so

finishes
with
an
odd
metallic
and
hard
water
character
medium
bodied
from
the
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
heavier
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
on
my
list
of
ofests
to
pick
up
again
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
far
from
the
worst
very
average
this
one
was
kind
of
a
letdown
for
me
im
generally
a
fan
of
the
marzen
style
especially
this
time
of
the
year
doesnt
even
hold
a
candle
to
sam
adams
which
i
use
as
a
benchmark
for
easy
to
find
oktoberfest
styles
the
flavoring
was
slightly
bland
and
the
coloring
a
little
lighter
than
expected
i
expected
much
better
from
the
guys
that
make
sunset
wheat
d
ill
reach
for
another
if
i
have
a
few
real
beers
first
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
this
until
later
in
the
evening
d
no
flavor
not
worth
drinking
notes
overall
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
but
average

about

poured
into

glass
no
head
at
all
slight
burnt
matly
taste
with
a
mild
hoppy
finish
crisp
and
light
in
the
mouth
its
cheap
and
not
that
bad
to
drink
if
your
gettin
loaded
dont
rush
to
the
store
to
buy
it
nicely
done
and
well
balanced
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
great
for
crisp
autumn
weather
or
anytime
really
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
a
whole
lot
worked
for
me
at
all
with
this
strange
flavors
and
a
weak
body
really
limited
the
drinkibility
as
well
i
would
not
try
this
again
this
tastes
like
seltzer
water
and
caramel
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
not
very
good
finally
broke
down
and
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
on
a
light
amber
body
smells
were
fairly
light
sweet
caramel
a
touch
of
hoppiness
taste
followed
suit
adding
in
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
i
like
leinies
beers
but
with
this
brew
in
line
with
many
of
their
catalog
leinies
seems
to
be
thinking
more
of
mass
appeal
than
really
striving
for
something
out
of
the
ballpark
its
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
good
and
easily
findable
just
nothing
to
push
it
up
towards
the
top
of
the
style
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
worst
octoberfest
beer
ive
ever
had
it
tastes
like
90
bud
light
mixed
wth
10
guiness
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
poured
a
reddish
copper
color
lots
of
head
after
a
hard
pour
head
was
slightly
offwhite
after
the
hard
pour
the
head
hung
around
awhile
and
left
some
decent
lacing
smelled
a
little
of
caramel
malt
and
grain
also
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
weird
slightly
bitter
that
taste
hung
around
a
while
it
was
almost
like
there
was
no
taste
maybe
a
little
caramel
but
not
much
maybe
more
sweet
than
caramel
to
me
it
was
hard
to
describe
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
about
right
i
was
trying
some
different
octoberfest
style
brew
and
felt
i
wasted
my
money
on
this
one
if
you
try
this
beer
make
sure
you
have
a
hard
pour
i
think
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
with
the
appearance
fizzy
overcarbed
bite
to
it
sweet
and
yucky
veggie
like
in
the
middle
and
sickening
grainymetallic
finish
ofest
this
is
a
definite
nofest
for
me
more
like
a
yuckfest
bleh
d
bleh
this
is
probably
the
first
bonafide
offensive
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
theres
something
about
the
dirtearth
flavor
that
really
detracts
mostly
the
rest
of
the
flavors
are
there
but
too
muted
and
overpowered
a
great
drinkable
beer
and
overall
a
great
offering
amongst
the
oktoberfest
seasonals
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
closer
adherents
to
the
original
though
it
could
use
a
slight
up
in
the
maltiness
body
and
alcohol
content
i
wasnt
really
expecting
to
like
this
beer
but
despite
the
artificial
sweetener
and
lack
of
conformity
to
the
style
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
worth
a
try
and
i
could
see
picking
it
up
again
everything
about
this
beer
is
great
except
the
flavor
a
good
middleoftheroad
example
of
the
style
it
claims
to
represent
you
cant
go
wrong
especially
if
youve
never
tried
the
style
and
you
see
this
example
overall
this
is
not
a
great
beer
there
is
absolutely
zero
complexity
and
it
has
many
attributes
of
a
macro
lager
worthy
a
try
yes
will
i
be
buying
any
more
no
flavor
is
quite
enjoyable
without
having
any
real
complexity
other
elements
are
a
bit
hohum
but
there
are
no
extreme
faults
either
you
could
down
big
mugs
of
this
while
doing
the
polka
and
its
flavor
is
nice
enough
to
be
enjoyed
any
old
time
but
id
probably
reach
for
a
stronger
representation
of
the
style
next
time
preferably
one
from
the
homeland
d
this
is
totally
to
style
its
not
exactly
the
best
or
most
outrageous
beer
to
drink
but
it
definitely
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
see
myself
spending
a
night
with
some
sausage
sauerkraut
and
some
of
this
stuff
not
too
shabby
in
that
aspect
overall
not
something
id
reach
for
all
the
time
d
in
fairness
its
light
taste
and
thin
mouth
make
for
drinking
a
lot
pretty
easy
a
sixer
is
affordable
and
could
go
down
easy
in
one
setting
this
is
a
good
one
for
the
relatives
that
come
over
and
want
a
special
beer
but
dont
like
the
ones
with
a
lot
of
taste
and
character

excellent

mouthfeel
lightmedium
body
slightly
grainy
but
it
does
have

good
beer
worth
a
shot
in
my
quest
to
sample
some
marzenoktoberfest
beers
i
seem
to
have
gotten
into
aa
mediocre
rut
this
beer
was
not
badlooking
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
white
head
after
that
there
wasnt
much
else
to
say
about
it
it
had
a
faint
malt
aroma
and
a
faint
malt
taste
i
think
there
was
a
hint
of
hops
but
i
couldnt
be
sure
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
too
many
of
very
lite
in
the
hop
category
with
the
aroma
and
the
quaff
doesnt
add
much
either
im
afraid
this
is
more
of
a
hoppy
pilsner
than
an
octoberfest
disappointing
attempt
at
the
style
this
will
be
a
one
and
done
sixer
d
if
you
are
looking
for
something
amber
without
any
offensive
flavors
that
you
could
drink
all
night
long
this
is
for
you
i
dont
think
i
would
call
it
an
oktoberfest
though
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
thin
marzen
without
the
heartyness
and
warming
quality
that
makes
the
style
so
appealing
for
the
fall
season
a
dissapointing
brew
from
leinies
d
there
are
many
better
american
oktoberfests
out
there
id
avoid
this
one

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
like
malts
there
is
no
balance
to
this
brew
but
it
definitely
goes
well
with
the
season
this
beer
pours
up
an
amber
coor
with
a
decent
white
head
the
nose
is
very
boring
just
your
everyday
run
of
the
mill
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
decent
bitter
malts
not
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
but
a
decent
american
one
tis
the
season
to
try
as
many
oktoberfest
lagers
as
possible
and
since
i
cant
be
in
munich
like
my
kids
and
their
friends
ive
tried
a
few
of
those
available
we
dont
get
many
leinies
brews
here
other
than
the
soda
pop
beers
that
seem
to
show
up
everywhere
so
i
was
excited
to
try
something
different
from
leinies
this
was
interesting
deep
orangeamber
in
the
glass
clear
with
a
decent
head
rather
fizzy
and
thin
mouthfeel
little
in
the
nose
but
a
heavy
malt
flavor
in
the
initial
taste
all
malt
and
then
more
malt
butter
dripping
slick
almost
cloying
maltalbeit
in
a
fizzy
watery
base
no
hops
at
all
nice
try
but
nothing
id
seek
to
buy
overall
impression
this
seems
like
a
below
average
amber
to
me
certainly
doesnt
stand
out
either
on
its
own
or
as
an
oktoberfest
d
leinies
oktoberfest
is
okay
but
it
falls
far
short
of
the
best
offerings
in
this
style
a
thin
tealike
fizzy
ofest
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
clear
orangeyamber
color
with
a
fluffy
lid
of
offwhite
foam
smells
of
munichy
and
toasted
grains
with
a
subtle
sweetness
and
some
mustyearthy
hops
flavor
is
not
great
slightly
sweet
grain
with
some
watery
toasted
grains
and
mustyherbal
earthy
hops
smooth
lightmedium
body
is
a
bit
watery
with
a
moderately
crisp
carbonation
not
one
of
the
best
as
i
suspected
it
may
not
be
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
moderately
cheap
oktoberfest
this
is
a
good
sixpack
to
go
with
other
than
that
its
pretty
much
your
basic
holiday
beer
overall
a
refreshing
beer
i
dont
mind
drinking
thats
just
my
opinion
and
its
hard
to
compare
to
sam
adams
while
not
a
top
tier
ofest
by
any
means
it
meets
the
basic
characteristics
of
the
style
and
is
easy
enough
to
drink
decent
choice
for
the
price
strong
corn
flavor
and
some
hops
at
the
end
to
much
carbonation
and
not
impresed
with
this
offering
at
all
i
love
this
stile
but
this
is
a
sad
offring
at
best
i
am
glad
that
i
only
bought
the
one
bottle
of
this
one
maby
i
will
try
one
next
year
but
not
in
any
rush
to
do
so
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
goldencopper
color
with
a
dense
onefinger
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
is
malty
as
one
might
expect
from
the
style
amber
and
slightly
toasted
grains
are
present
not
a
whole
lot
more
discernable
about
it
for
me
the
taste
is
reflective
of
the
nose
a
solid
amber
malty
backbone
with
hopping
to
balance
but
no
hop
presence
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
dense
as
i
would
expect
from
the
style
a
lightmedium
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
either
same
with
the
beer
overall
not
bad
but
very
underwhelming
i
guess
you
could
call
this
drinkable
in
that
it
isnt
offensive
or
challenging
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
that
is
really
in
the
keeping
of
the
spirit
of
ba
if
this
wasnt
in
the
fridge
i
wouldnt
have
another
not
good
and
not
worth
paying
craft
prices
when
you
could
get
innumerable
oktoberfest
beers
that
are
much
better
d
for
the
most
part
a
good
beer
to
drink
the
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
and
good
character
carried
through
has
its
faults
but
in
the
long
run
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
this
one
nice
little
surprise
surely
not
great
but
not
awful
as
many
others
seem
to
feel
d
not
bad
but
there
are
many
oktoberfests
that
i
prefer
dont
know
if
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
dsure
overall
im
not
impressed
one
bit
this
could
have
been
a
better
beer
being
that
im
from
the
great
land
of
wisconsin
i
always
give
my
local
beers
a
fighting
chance
this
one
unfortunately
never
should
have
happened
lately
leinenkugels
has
been
hit
or
miss
with
me
hit
with
creamy
dark
miss
with
summer
shandy
hit
with
red
miss
with
sunset
wheat
hit
with
honey
weiss
miss
with
oktoberfest
cant
win
em
all
not
a
good
octoberfest
beer
it
was
the
correct
color
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
was
way
off
i
would
not
even
call
it
an
octoberfest
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
about
leinenkugel
with
all
their
weird
beers
but
this
one
def
did
not
help
dont
even
bother
trying
this
one
just
stay
away
overall
the
price
is
low
and
the
flavor
is
decent
if
you
find
it
on
sale
it
is
worth
it
to
pick
some
up
serving
type
bottle
this
would
be
a
really
good
oktoberfest
if
there
was
a
little
more
caramel
sweetness
to
round
out
the
malt
profile
nothing
above
and
beyond
d
definitely
on
the
wrong
side
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
list
dont
thing
ill
be
having
this
one
again
not
a
real
good
effort
but
keep
trying
d
decent
but
probably
wouldnt
have
again
well
first
of
the
style
to
show
up
in
town
and
actually
the
first
time
the
leinies
has
shown
up
here
and
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
well
rounded
brew
no
symphany
of
flavours
here
too
bad
a
smooth
lager
and
a
malty
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
however
syrupy
with
hints
of
caramel
and
maple
give
me
a
strong
malt
presence
in
this
beer
please
a
decent
oktoberfest
d
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
one
theres
just
so
many
better
so
ill
just
have
to
pass
verfy
drinkable
but
there
are
others
more
drinkable
it
is
well
worth
the
time
to
sit
down
with
a
few
and
enjoy
on
a
nice
evening
a
nice
flavor
but
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
an
oktoberfest
lousy
marzen
presented
by
a
usually
decent
brewer
aroma
is
nonexistent
appearance
is
good
with
a
nice
bronze
color
and
small
creamy
head
average
feel
here
with
a
weak
finish
flavor
is
decent
for
a
standard
lager
but
falls
fairly
short
for
an
oktoberfest
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
leinenkugels
may
be
falling
to
the
wayward
hands
of
their
owner
i
only
hope
their
other
brews
arent
being
compromised
by
cheap
ingredients
poured
a
very
orange
copper
color
there
was
a
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
mild
some
malt
light
spice
noticeable
the
taste
is
thin
with
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
some
decent
hops
flavor
but
relatively
unnoticeable
and
forgettable
taste
this
is
a
mediocre
brew
from
lenies
for
whom
i
respect
most
of
the
beer
they
brew
not
their
best
work
here
as
with
most
of
leinkugels
beers
this
leans
more
towards
a
macro
than
a
micro
it
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
suddy
light
beige
head
the
nose
is
grainy
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
mostly
weak
malt
and
old
hops
body
is
light
and
fizzy
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
so
if
you
like
leinenkugels
original
of
which
i
do
find
to
be
a
pretty
good
lager
then
youll
like
this
its
just
mislabeled
as
an
oktoberfest
drinkability
easily
sessionable
but
id
generally
go
for
something
with
a
little
more
roasttoast
to
it
for
an
ofest
doesnt
stand
up
against
its
similarly
priced
peers
of
the
style
has
a
pleasing
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
but
the
taste
is
quite
nondescript
flavor
is
basically
just
malt
with
a
bit
of
grass
or
earthiness
to
it
though
it
does
have
a
light
crisp
finish
that
makes
me
think
it
could
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
if
taste
or
complexity
arent
really
concerns
d
okay
drinkability
not
a
beer
i
would
get
again
drinkability
is
good
with
this
beer
its
one
to
try
if
you
find
it
overall
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
when
presented
with
limited
options
at
a
bar
id
give
this
one
another
go
it
just
wasnt
flavorful
enought
to
make
me
say
it
was
really
good
i
went
into
this
beer
expecting
a
bit
more
this
beer
isnt
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
had
but
it
has
enough
light
flavor
throuhgout
to
keep
things
interesting
when
you
dont
want
to
be
overpowered
by
the
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
throw
back
several
of
these
fits
the
profile
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
get
at
a
restaurant
with
a
limited
selection
and
might
buy
a
six
pack
once
in
a
while
for
an
easy
going
drinkable
lager
drinkability
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
and
an
outright
disappointing
beer
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
but
its
kind
of
lacking
in
the
flavor
sessionable
drinkability
not
bad
a
good
backup
plan
something
friends
who
arent
into
craft
beers
could
enjoy
edit
the
first
one
of
these
i
had
alone
and
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
the
last
one
i
had
outside
at
a
ballgame
with
a
brat
and
i
felt
much
better
about
it
granted
its
not
a
particularly
impressive
oktoberfest
and
i
think
leinies
can
do
better
but
it
is
better
than
a
budweiser
there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
not
a
great
appreance
kinda
orangy
lager
color
not
really
any
octoberfest
taste
that
i
could
pick
out
very
thin
watery
mouthfeel
overall
just
a
big
dissapointment
leinenkugels
oktoberfest
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
left
a
little
spotty
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
toasted
malt
the
taste
was
toasted
malt
and
hops
with
a
little
sweetness
upfront
and
a
semidry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
an
average
beer
but
a
little
thin
for
an
oktoberfest
a
fairly
light
beer
with
a
slight
fizz
on
the
tongue
could
drink
a
few
of
these
quit
easily
nothing
great
here
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cool
afternoon
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
for
a
discounted
price
d
average
tasting
oktoberfest
style
beer
just
average
i
liked
this
one
buyed
it
to
try
it
was
nicely
priced
and
i
love
oktoberfests
so
gave
it
a
whirl
when
i
found
it
smells
of
caramel
and
munich
malts
no
hops
to
speak
of
at
least
undetectable
but
the
style
requires
little
anyway
had
a
little
lacing
and
decent
head
tasted
good
rich
malts
with
a
nice
caramel
front
and
back
and
as
most
oktobers
easy
to
drink
will
check
it
out
again
better
than
most
run
of
the
mill
but
nothing
to
seek
out
when
others
are
out
there
at
similar
prices
thanks
to
mac56
for
this
one
originally
reviewed
on
september
17
2005
at
the
big
lake
brewfest
light
dusty
malt
aroma
clear
orange
with
offwhite
head
nasty
plant
malt
without
much
of
anything
extremely
bland
finish
this
is
worthless
both
skunky
and
sugary
not
it
doesnt
really
have
any
merit
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
shade

two
and
a
half
fingers
of
creamy
eggshell
tinted

show
decent

and
light

crystal

and
dextrins
in
the
nose
with
a
subtle
flowery
hop
aroma
caramel
sweetness
upfront
follwed
by
an
indistinct
adjunct
taste
lighter
flavor
but
nonoffensive
dry
aftertaste
spicy
tettnanger
hop
flavor
and
a
great
deal
of
bland
hop
bitterness
thin
bodied
with
high
carbonation
that
creates
a
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
dextrinous
finish
showing
a
hint
of
toasty
vienna
malt
with
a
stubborn
hop
bitterness
that
really
throws
the
balance
off
this
has
a
good
drinkability
but
given
the
lack
of
malt
character
and
assertive
hops
it
seems
to
miss
the
point
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
skipable
ofest
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
i
got
my
6pack
for
4
99
low
flavor
highly
consumable
ofest
beer
i
am
really
not
liking
leinenkugels
seasonal
offerings
drinkability
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
a
very
disappointing
octoberfest
i
didnt
think
slapping
a
label
on
a
beer
is
all
it
takes
to
make
an
oktoberfest
is
it
way
too
bland
tastes
like
a
macro
with
a
bit
of
artificial
flavorings
without
a
label
people
would
be
all
over
the
map
trying
to
nail
the
style
as
a
lager
i
would
have
given
it
an
average
for
taste
but
masquerading
as
an
oktoberfest
i
give
it
a
not
impressed
this
is
an
alright
octoberfest
its
a
little
thin
it
does
have
that
american
lager
smell
which
i
think
has
not
place
in
a
german
style
beer
when
it
comes
to
om
i
expected
lienies
to
really
deliver
for
some
reason
unfortunately
this
offering
while
respectable
is
definately
a
lightwieght
light
color
light
aroma
light
taste
with
some
mentionable
toasted
character
fizzy
mouthfeel
an
all
around
average
oktoberfest
to
be
sure
it
goes
down
smooth
though
i
think
i
drank
4
in
one
sitting
appears
a
light
copper
orange
with
a
quickly
dwindling
white
head
leaves
thin
specks
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
strong
metallic
tone
with
weak
watery
caramel
malts
and
not
hop
profile
to
speak
about
taste
is
flooded
with
grainy
notes
more
metal
highlights
alot
of
caramel
but
it
comes
of
sour
and
acidic
in
nature
mouthfeel
has
a
watery
feel
to
it
very
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
this
isnt
where
its
at
not
just
style
wise
its
a
poorly
constructed
beer
drain
pour
always
a
sucker
for
the
seasonals
even
if
i
know
that
they
wont
be
great
brews
though
the
beer
has
some
nice
caramel
and
bready
flavors
but
not
the
body
or
the
malt
additions
to
properly
disquise
the
graininess
and
weakness
hopped
nicely
for
an
earthy
european
character
but
again
falls
a
little
metalic
under
the
timid
body
finishes
a
little
mintyfresh
and
alcoholic
but
reamining
grainy
and
weak
i
had
this
beer
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
mug
it
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
slight
head
with
little
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
was
weak
and
slightly
citrusy
there
was
almost
nothing
to
the
taste
other
than
a
acidic
tinny
flavor
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
yet
have
several
more
of
them
on
chill
thankfully
i
have
superior
oktoberfests
to
drink
so
first
beer
from
this
brewery
a
seasonal
not
bad
id
still
put
this
in
a
average
category
lots
of
other
things
to
try
and
price
doesnt
allow
this
to
be
stocked
in
my
fridge
it
did
make
me
want
to
buy
some
genny
red
drinkability
ugh
i
like
the
oktoberfest
style
especially
in
the
fall
but
this
beer
does
the
style
wrong
only
the
faintest
hints
of
the
style
are
present
even
more
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
actively
offensive
you
can
have
the
rest
of
mine
worth
a
try
does
seem
to
describe
this
beer
the
best
an
overall
average
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
brew
i
am
more
for
the
big
malty
robust
flavors
of
the
fall
but
in
all
respects
give
it
a
try
cheers
doesnt
rank
very
high
on
my
list
of
other
octoberfest
type
beers
i
have
tried
d
this
is
oktoberfest
light
i
have
trouble
even
calling
this
oktoberfest
it
will
work
for
those
who
drink
lite
but
for
snob
it
leaves
me
flat
not
one
of
the
better
leinie
efforts
dits
ok
but
not
a
much
flavor
as
i
hoped
for
i
might
buy
a
few
sixers
for
my
dad
and
brother
this
fall
ill
hide
their
bud
light
and
pull
the
old
switchochango
well
see
what
happens
d
this
beer
didnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
but
it
was
also
not
real
interesting
in
flavor
either
the
pot
caramel
was
the
only
real
flavor
and
it
was
a
bit
off
a
good
marzen
which
i
knew
nothing
of
when
i
first
reviewed
this
is
not
an
oktoberfest
it
is
a
slightly
maltier
version
of
a
pilsner
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
is
bland
with
only
a
faint
malt
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
because
it
doesnt
have
any
negative
distinguishing
features
an
average
beer
all
around
more
interesting
than
a
typical
bmc
but
not
nearly
as
interesting
as
a
typical
micro
beer
another
solid
beer
from
leinenkugel
i
do
feel
fortunate
that
these
guys
have
their
beers
in
detroit
as
they
are
a
nice
change
up
from
time
to
time
and
they
rarely
disappoint
pours

to

glass
medium
level
of
carbonation
smell
is
faint
but
notes
of
malt
and
grain
are
detected
with
an
overall
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
earth
that
initially
smells
skunky
but
blooms
into
more
of
a
natural
chipped
wood
aroma
its
hard
to
understand
yes
i
know
but
thats
what
i
got
from
it
anyhow
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
laden
with
flavors
of
lightly
roasted
malts
some
dough
corn
and
hops
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
nominal
for
the
style
nothing
special
yet
not
bad
overall
drinkability
is
above
average
id
have
no
problem
having
this
in
my
fridge
during
oktoberfest
time
worth
a
try
a
bit
overly
fizzy
and
the
hop
bite
was
a
bit
stronger
that
others
of
the
style
ive
had
in
the
past
malt
was
a
bit
suppresed
as
well
kind
of
reminiscent
of
a
hybrid
between
what
it
should
be
and
a
more
mainstream
lager
just
barely
decent
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
search
for
has
potential
if
they
feel
like
tweaking
the
recipe
and
toning
down
the
megabrew
bs
lager
side
of
the
formula
and
making
it
a
real
octoberfestmarzen
imo
pours
a
decent
coppery

this
beer

no

this

021919
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
small
film
some
sparse
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
grassy
caramel
brown
sugar
doughy
bread
lightly
floral
the
taste
has
an
initially
wellrounded
dominant
malt
accompanied
by
a
light
citrus
but
it
runs
a
little
thin
on
its
way
to
the
floral
lightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
not
too
shabby
at
all
nothing
spectacular
but
when
you
take
price
into
account
this
is
quite
worth
it
12
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
mostly
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
strong
aroma
of
grain
the
aroma
is
a
little
herbal
and
very
unpleasant
this
beer
has
that
nasty
wet
carboard
flavor
with
sugar
and
adjuncts
no
toasted
malt
flavor
maybe
a
little
hop
flavor
but
its
hard
to
tell
this
beer
is
pretty
bad
even
by
macro
standards
at
least
most
macros
have
the
sense
to
be
bland
this
is
flavorful
but
the
flavor
is
nasty
not
a
drain
pour
but
close
thin
white
head
raises
to
one
finger
and
disipates
fast
lingers
at
nearly
nothing
and
laces
slightly
but
follows
the
beer
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
not
good
at
all
musty
almost
very
grainy
it
may
be
a
blessing
that
it
is
a
faint
smell
taste
however
is
actually
quite
nice
at
first
full
and
malty
very
clean
finish
as
ab
puts
it
which
means
nothing
is
there
no
after
taste
nothing
mouthfeel
is
water
but
ok
a
very
average
beer
a
little
weak
for
an
oktoberfest
but
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
the
worst
tasting
oktoberfest
i
have
come
across
to
be
avoided
overall
i
was
a
bit
impressed
with
this
offering
my
expectations
were
a
little
surpassed
a
sweeter
than
dry
oktoberfest
with
a
good
but
fleeting
flavor
profile
that
requires
no
pondering
just
drink
and
be
merry
a
good
beer
to
have
for
curious
fenceriding
newbies
leinies
oktoberfest
pours
a
tawny
color
probably
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
scale
for
the
style
colorwise
its
capped
by
a
head
of
impressive
and
no
doubt
chemicallyaided
longevity
which
provides
good
lacing
looks
pretty
good
smells
malty
and
slightly
musty
the
taste
is
similar
though
i
swear
theres
a
touch
of
banana
with
a
little
bit
of
a
toasted
finish
the
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
phenol
and
metal
mmm
i
dont
want
any
more
of
thissorry
dad
ahhh
what
can
i
say
a
cool
refreshing
cheap
beer
from
the
masters
of
leinenkugel
this
is
a
good
bbq
lawnmowing
football
watching
beer
and
is
always
a
tasty
treat
in
the
cool
crisp
wisconsin
autumns
looks
nice
in
a
glass
and
has
a
crisp
hearty
flavor
i
think
leinenkugel
is
underated
as
an
everyday
beer
and
would
strongly
reccommend
as
a
replacement
to
your
bud
or
miller
rituals
at
8
49
a
twelver
ill
buy
everytime
a
lightweight
entry
in
the
field
best
to
avoid
a
good
try
at
a
wisconsin
okto
that
is
hamstring
by
megabrew
constraints
decently
golden
brown
color
and
foamy
head
a
nice
amber
malt
character
but
nothing
that
says
its
anything
but
a
lager
with
a
few
darker
grains
thrown
in
no
real
faults
as
a
beer
but
oktos
are
too
easy
a
style
to
go
bland
in
this
beer
pours
a
copper
orange
color
with
an
average
sized
head
it
smells
malty
but
a
little
plain
taste
carmel
carmel
carmel
the
carmelized
malts
really
stand
out
in
this
one
leaving
a
nice
sweet
flavor
and
a
very
welcoming
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
also
excellent
i
could
drink
several
of
these
a
decent
oktoberfest
a
good
beer
when
something
like
this
is
around
theres
really
no
excuse
to
resort
to
budweiser
or
miller
lite
quality
beer
at
a
low
price
worth
a
try
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
but
there
is
a
caramel
and
a
very
small
amount
of
lager
stank
the
flavor
was
subdued
a
bit
has
a
caramel
character
with
a
bready
feel
but
nothing
spectacular
this
is
just
a
run
of
the
mill
oktoberfest
this
leaves
the
bottle
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
definately
marzen
lots
of
caramel
and
some
of
the
lager
characters
but
not
so
strong
the
flavor
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
with
a
caramel
tone
to
it
as
well
there
is
a
sweet
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
at
best
drinkability
is
just
okay
nothing
special
here
id
take
a
spaten
over
this
one
a
good
ofest
not
a
great
one
but
not
a
bad
one
either
this
may
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
for
some
folks
while
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
category
it
is
not
good
enough
to
move
far
up
the
rankings
of
the
wisconsin
regional
breweries
oktoberfests
this
one
comes
in
4th
behind
the
offerings
from
point
berghoffhuber
city
this
beer
is
an
ideal
entry
level
oktoberfest
to
introduce
someone
to
it
is
no
too
over
powering
and
is
an
ok
session
beer
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
very
little
head
actually
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
is
very
little
head
but
for
some
reason
the
opposite
is
true
when
your
drinking
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
it
get
foamin
up
suspect
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
general
overcarbonation
of
leinies
beers
in
my
opinion
i
do
not
get
a
strong
smell
of
anything
in
particular
beer
is
rather
sweet
perhaps
the
sweetest
oktoberfest
i
have
had
this
year
can
really
taste
the
malt
but
cannot
detect
hops
or
alcohol
beer
tastes
better
cold
than
warm
believe
it
or
not
i
know
that
sabmillerleinie
can
do
better
than
this
timid
seasonal
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
thats
made
to
pound
straight
from
the
bottle
i
almost
feel
the
urge
to
add
something
to
it
to
make
it
taste
like
something
anything
this
is
not
a
good
beer
came
in
a
sampler
of
wi
ofests
i
recently
received
pours
a
light
copperstraw
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
of
singed
sweet
bread
malt
with
a
mild
scotch
tape
hop
smell
im
not
a
huge
3m
adhesivesmell
fan
but
its
not
too
offputting
taste
comes
at
you
with
a
bready
and
bland
malt
attack
up
front
okay
maybe
more
of
a
coast
it
on
in
in
neutral
than
an
attack
anyway
this
gives
way
to
a
cereal
malt
wash
midway
and
finally
to
some
indistinct
yet
mildly
bitter
hops
finish
is
a
little
astringent
mouthfeel
is
average
to
thin
for
an
ofest
overall
slightly
more
malt
and
character
than
a
leinies
lager
or
northwoods
but
a
rather
watereddown
oktoberfest
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
some
lacing
nice
malt
and
yeast
balancing
in
the
nose
toasted
bread
malt
aroma
and
the
yeast
smells
somewhat
spicey
clean
flavor
dominated
by
malt
finishs
dry
with
a
little
grainy
astringency
overall
a
very
good
oktoberfest
style
not
too
much
to
complain
about
but
certainly
no
overwhelmingly
good
traits
leinenkugels
has
much
better
styles
but
go
ahead
and
try
this
one
for
something
different
the
beer
warmed
up
and
i
warmed
up
to
it
the
carb
toned
down
and
the
maltyness
came
out
to
greet
me
still
not
a
great
beer
the
taste
and
drinkability
got
bumped
up
looks
pretty
good
clear
dark
amber
with
a
decentsized
offwhite
head
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
few
random
patches
on
the
glass
smell
is
mildly
malty
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
but
weak
really
not
much
going
on
here
are
there
hops
in
this
slightly
sour
aftertaste
watery
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
very
good
either
i
find
myself
without
a
strong
opinion
on
this
beer
it
isnt
bad
but
theres
really
nothing
to
recommend
it
either
i
find
it
to
be
middleoftheroad
as
far
as
leinies
goes
better
than
berry
weiss
and
honey
weiss
but
not
as
good
as
creamy
dark
and
red
before
drinking
what
is
my
first
every
oktoberfest
i
wondered
what
an
oktoberfest
was
supposed
to
taste
like
after
drinking
it
im
still
not
sure
that
i
know
pours
a
clear
autumn
amber
with
a
slight
eggshell
colored
head
that
forms
a
nice
inch
a
half
but
fades
to
a
thin
film
rather
quick
the
carbonation
is
up
abit
ti
almost
fizzlike
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
hop
in
the
taste
is
slight
as
well
but
just
enough
to
balance
to
a
dry
mouth
finish
the
body
is
light
alittle
watery
but
drinkable
all
and
all
just
a
maltier
version
of
the
regular
leinies
beers
pours
an
amber
hue
with
a
white
head
malty
sweetness
medium
bitterness
average
for
an
ofest
beer
i
still
have
a
few
left
and
its
not
bad
but
not
great
better
than
budweiser
since
you
wont
run
into
these
guys
until
next
year
i
will
say
that
it
is
better
than
a
macro
lager
but
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
dark
golden
color
cheap
foamy
head
and
no
lace
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
is
cut
down
to
size
by
the
adjunct
used
corn
taste
mimics
smell
your
interest
is
piqued
by
a
biscuity
goodness
that
is
soon
drowned
in
adjunct
badness
pretty
light
and
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
thin
hop
profile
adds
nothing
ofest
light
easy
to
drink
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
flavors
fairly
lame
and
tame
deep
amber
in
color
the
head
is
beige
the
lace
is
adequate
the
nose
is
caramel
sweet
malt
and
quite
pleasing
front
sweet
the
top
is
light
to
moderate
the
finish
is
lightly
dry
middlingly
acidic
basally
hopped
drinkable
but
nothing
to
get
excitied
about
as
with
most
of
lennies
beers
does
not
rank
on
my
current
1000
beer
master
list
a
slightly
above
average
beer
in
general
but
a
weak
oktoberfest
the
color
was
light
amber
and
there
was
very
little
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
but
very
light
might
be
a
good
entry
oktoberfest
for
someone
trying
the
style
for
the
first
time
after
only
drinking
macros
but
i
like
more
flavor
a
very
light
version
of
an
octoberfest
slightly
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
more
like
an
amber
than
a
marzen
someone
mentioned
a
mix
of
an
octoberfest
and
a
killians
red
id
say
that
was
right
on
drinkable
and
good
but
not
the
best
offering
of
the
style
copper
in
hue
w
trace
haze
covered
by
a
very
dense
persistent
head
that
leaves
belgian
lace
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweetness
derived
from
both
caramel
malt
and
unfortunately
corn
toasty
munich
malt
and
a
lemony
hop
nose
are
secondary
and
very
light
bready
sweetness
upfront
is
followed
by
mildly
buttery
malt
and
notes
of
grain
husk
sweetness
then
mimics
the
aroma
mid
palate
becoming
a
combination
of
caramel
malt
and
cooked
corn
hop
bitterness
is
paltry
but
since
overall
sweetness
is
fairly
light
for
style
decent
balance
is
acheived
moderate
in
body
w
a
surprisingly
dextrinous
mouthfeel
considering
the
apparent
use
of
adjuncts
finishes
with
notes
of
sweet
biscuit
and
grits
an
odd
and
not
particularly
good
oktoberfest
think
paulaners

i
dont
think
this
is
up
to
ba
standards
of
what
an
oktoberfest
beer
should
deliver
ill
skip
this
one
next
year
clear

color
a
big
pillowy
white
head
sits
on
top
pretty
decent
aroma
dominated
by
a
luscious

taste
has
an
interesting
hop

nice
little
hebalness
which
add
nicely
to
the
underlying
toasted
malt
taste
medium
to
full
in
body
and
goes
down
the
hatch
fairly
effortlessly
a
little
better
than
average
for
an
ofest
a
pretty
average
octoberfest
that
works
nicely
as
a
thrist
quenching
amber
style
beer
the
nose
is
unremarkable
some
maltiness
but
some
corn
or
adjunct
smell
as
well
body
is
thin
for
this
style
but
i
dont
mind
it
so
much
i
bought
this
figuring
it
would
have
some
decent
malt
tones
and
be
rather
thineasy
drinking
i
was
dying
of
thirst
after
work
tonight
and
this
went
down
nicely
the
taste
is
on
the
malty
side
but
not
real
heavy
it
does
finish
with
a
little
dry
note
not
an
alltime
great
but
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
the
right
spot
body
is
void
of
any
real
flaws
but
lacks
any
real

in

sugar

both

for

the
boldness
id
expect
but
is
of
a
stronger
malt
than
just
pale

with
some
richness
in

leaving
some
dryness
on

medium

that
seems
appropriate

adequate
carbonation
for
me
not
an
altogether
poor
start
to
the
oktoberfest
season
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
really
appreciated
the
fullness
of
the
body
though
i
would
have
tweaked
the
taste
a
bit
i
think
12
oz
bottle
purchased
somewhere
in
nw
d
c
dated

poured
into
my
snallygaster
2014
mug
drank
over
30
minutes
i
am
not
digging
the
caramel
aspect
of
this
one
it
really
ruins
it
for
me
great
spicy
hops
though
full
of
flavor
goes
great
with
authentic
german
cuisine
great
balance
of
ingredients
with
no
bitterness
ehh
not
very
good
at
all
hoping
i
just
got
a
bad
one
will
try
another
bottle
and
hopefully
be
able
to
improve
review
m
light
bodied
and
goes
down
with
ease
the
munich
malts
are
perfect
in
this
one
a
great
beer
and
would
love
it
again

stronger
than
many
but
still
very
clean
and
crisp
flavors
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
clean
cereal
notes
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
taste
is
also
dominated
by
cereal
notes
with
light
residual
sugar
with
a
clean
finish
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
perfect
example
of
the
style
o
thats
a
good
tasty
marzen
relying
on
malt
and
yeast
to
provide
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
profile
while
spice
and
hops
remain
comfortably
in
the
background
super
drinkable
good
thing
its
über
available
in
ne
ohio
this
time
of
year
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
typical
oktoberfest
this
is
not
the
right
beer
if
you
want
something
in
the
oktoberfest
style
that
is
slightly
more
sophisticated
then
this
is
a
great
choice
overall
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
ive
had
yet
so
for
the
style
i
rate
this
beer
very
highly
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
color
there
was
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
decent
aroma
a
bit
of
toasted
malts
possible
some
earthy
hops
also
no
noticeable
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
toasted
malts
and
slight
biscuit
notes
it
has
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
is
very
smooth
nice
overall
this
was
again
a
great
suggestion
from
the
bartender
at
this
establishment
we
are
typically
always
on
top
of
what
we
want
to
order
from
our
beer
spots
almost
always
before
we
even
get
there
but
we
were
being
so
indecisive
so
decided
to
go
with
this
proposed
offering
however
widely
available
it
is
again
we
were
not
disappointed
this
is
your
quintessential
southern
german
oktoberfestbier
the
flavoring
was
beautifully
balanced
to
a
crisp
malty
push
although
we
did
find
a
lacking
of
even
the
mildest
hops
making
for
a
highly
sippable
and
enjoyable
beverage
to
relax
with
this
beer
fits
well
with
the
change
in
the
season
to
colder
weather
and
should
satisfy
the
palate
of
any
novice
or
expert
alike
overall
best
ofest
ive
tried
get
you
some
very
good
oktoberfest
quite
delicious
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
amber
with
an
lasting
off
white
head
very
light
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
toasted
grains
barley
malt
with
mild
bitterness
a
full
flavored
brew
with
a
smooth
medium
body
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
finishes
with
toasted
grains
and
some
moderate
caramel
malt
comes
thru
as
it
warms
up
balanced
with
some
light
hops
bitterness
ending
has
a
lingering
nutty
flavor
overall
a
very
good
and
flavorful
brew
my
favorite
in
the
style
has
more
depth
than
most
octoberfests
o
3
5
a
little
better
than
i
remember
but
i
still
find
it
to
be
overly
sweet
which
takes
away
from
being
able
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
a
quality
i
feel
is
necessary
for
the
style
its
abv
of
6
5
also
keeps
it
from
being
sessionable
ill
pass
on
this
and
go
with
others
for
oktoberfests
in
the
future
very
rich
maltyslightly
sweet
smelltastecharacteristics
yet
the
very
light
hoppy
smooth
tangyzingy
clean
finish
just
a
great
sessionable
beer
imo
people
that
are
giving
this
low
ratingssaying
its
bad
are
ignorant
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
a
marzen
instead
of
taking
the
bolder
approach
that
most
american
brewerys
do
great
lakes
went
very
traditional
with
this
one
and
they
did
a
good
job
at
showing
what
this
style
is
all
about
it
might
be
hard
to
pick
this
one
out
among
a
few
german
examples
of
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
fairly
clean
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
especially
if
i
was
at
a
local
oktoberfest
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
just
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
embodied
what
a
good
marzen
is
all
about
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
wasnt
not
a
single
thing
that
i
disliked
or
that
i
thought
was
out
of
place
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
so
far
its
the
only
american
made
marzen
that
ive
had
this
season
that
i
would
go
back
and
get
a
six
pack
of
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
just
sessionable
malty
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
impressed
with
this
brew
great
lakes
took
the
path
that
not
a
lot
of
american
brewerys
take
and
in
the
end
i
think
it
really
payed
off
from
them
and
it
resulted
in
one
tasty
brew
so
far
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
american
made
marzen
great
job
guys
this
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
i
dont
write
reviews
often
but
this
one
deserves
the
rare
moment
i
look
forward
to
marzen
style
beers
and
this
is
hands
down
the
best
one
in
america
of
those
i
tried
it
represents
the
style
so
perfectly
i
had
to
give
it
a
five
great
lakes
never
seems
to
disappoint
and
i
very
much
appreciate
their
attention
to
detail
when
brewing
a
certain
style
especially
old
world
ones
dont
pass
this
one
up
ill
be
purchasing
this
annually
o
this
is
a
rocksolid
märzen
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
german
märzens
that
ive
had
but
i
cant
think
of
an
american
example
that
i
prefer
to
this
one
a
great
beer
for
autumn
weather
and
probably
my
top
pick
for
oktoberfest
celebrations
when
the
store
doesnt
have
any
german
märzens
in
stock
96
pours
low
foam
but
pure
copper
clean
and
fresh
looking
all
malt
nose
taste
is
a
malt
bomb
toffee
caramel
bread
with
a
nice
hop
in
between
a
touch
sweet
on
my
palate
have
had
stronger
marzens
but
certainly
good
overall
as
lagers
go
this
is
a
very
big
beer
when
i
started
getting
into
craft
beer
this
was
my
handsdown
favorite
the
last
two
times
i
have
had
it
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
not
cloying
as
i
found
sam
adams
which
has
subsequently
been
less
cloying
but
very
very
sweet
a
lovely
beer
throughout
easy
to
drink
and
the
6
5
is
easy
to
overlook
as
this
is
just
so
good
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
back
a
few
of
these
not
sure
if
this
years
release
is
particularly
bad
or
what
my
experience
of
this
beer
is
a
shadow
of
what
everybody
else
seems
to
be
tasting
not
many
redeeming
qualities
simple
and
straight
to
the
point
not
overdone
and
well
balanced
if
you
are
looking
to
try
a
seasonal
oktoberfest
offering
you
cant
go
wrong
picking
this
one
bbd

pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
dark
ruby
hue
good

rich

of

and
a

medium

with
a
creamy
texture
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
excellent
flavor
profile
that
is
balanced
and
complex
it
begins
with
a
toasted
biscuit
character
which
flows
into
caramel
over
a
subtle
note
of
sweetness
the
middle
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
spice
the
finish
is
clean
slightly
sweet
and
a
noble
hop
flavor
lingers
while
the
spice
tickles
the
tongue
great
lakes
has
nailed
it
again
overall
not
a
fan
of
most
oktoberfests
and
only
have
a
couple
when
in
season
with
that
said
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
iv
had
good
quality
at
a
good
price
what
great
lakes
does
best
had
this
on
tap
at
the
village
anchor
my
second
review
of
a
great
lakes
brew
outstanding
oktoberfest
one
of
my
favorites
great
molassesmaplebiscuit
flavor
exactly
how
youd
want
it
i
feel
like
sometimes
these
kinds
of
beers
get
a
little
syrupy
to
hit
this
kind
of
flavor
but
theres
none
of
that
here
the
color
here
is
a
mix
between
orange
and
amber
darker
than
most
which
is
nice
soft
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
head
really
good
stuff
total
3550
the
best
by
date
was
110514
yes
balanced
but
balanced
nothingness
too
sweet
i
have
never
differed
so
much
with
ba
and
bros
opinions
the
first
great
lakes
beer
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
verdict
a
delicious
example
of
the
märzen
style
from
great
lakes
balanced
earthy
lightly
sweet
with
mild
bitterness
but
more
importantly
extremely
refreshing
overall
as
far
as
americanmade
oktoberfests
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
its
hopped
just
right
keeping
the
caramel
in
check
but
certainly
you
wouldnt
say
this
is
hoppy
great
lakes
does
their
approachable
beers
so
well
and
this
is
another
winner
amber
color
smooth
taste
i
liked
this
one
but
i
only
got
a
sample
of
it
95
a
overall
a
decently
good
marzen
not
a
ton
going
on
bit
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
but
would
try
it
again
great
beer
great
color
great
taste
although
im
not
sure
if
its
the
best
as
the
2014
oktoberfests
are
introduced
this
is
not
my
favorite
time
will
tell
overall
a
refreshing
and
good
example
of
this
fall
seasonal
a
good
offering
by
great
lakes
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
bready
fresh
and
malty
i
could
definitely
do
a
six
of
these
pours
copper
orange
with
perfect
clarity
and
some
lager
bubbles
wafting
up
to
the
top
brilliant
beer
shines
with
fiery
and
golden
hues
creamy
head
of
foam
that
lasts
sweet
malty
nose
a
bit
of
depth
a
drizzle
of
honey
noble
hops
give
the
faint
scent
of
fresh
hay
sweet
biscuit
taste
is
simply
lovely
smooth
crisp
sweet
malt
tantalizing
with
a
faint
bi
t
of
honey
small
hop
bit
ion
the
back
end
perfect
dryness
and
a
light
graham
cracker
faint
grass
in
the
last
moments
and
this
one
is
fantastic
this
was
a
ver
nice
deep
amber
pour
with
a
12
finger
of
white
head
i
sensed
a
bit
of
cariander
and
lemon
on
the
nose
it
was
somewhat
malt
forward
but
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
nice
balance
medium
on
the
mothfeel
and
a
good
carbonation
throughout
loving
me
some
great
lakes
always
consistently
strong
oktoberfest
is
not
an
exception
marzen
beers
are
maltier
beers
my
palate
has
become
adapted
to
resinous
hops
this
summer
and
it
will
be
an
adjustment
of
the
palate
i
have
not
been
a
fan
of
great
lakes
in
the
past
because
i
felt
like
they
put
too
much
malt
in
their
supposedly
hoppier
beers
on
the
contrary
this
beer
is
designed
to
be
a
maltier
beer
classical
marzen
in
that
respect
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
am
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
100
rating
that
ba
gives
it
but
it
is
a
tasty
brew
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
this
fall
and
comparing
them
to
this
one
which
apparently
is
seen
as
one
of
if
not
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
produced
in
the
us
cheers
o
3
00
this
is
a
nice
summer
evening
beer
the
malty
sweetness
is
the
main
draw
here
it
is
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
but
i
would
not
turn
one
down
poured
a
deep
and
clear
amber
a
great
creamy
offwhite
cap
of
head
lasts
well
into
the
beer
aided
by
a
steady
stream
of
effervescence
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
with
some
mild
malt
notes
the
taste
has
some
nice
biscuit
notes
a
little
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
earthiness
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
and
theres
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
this
is
a
very
good
lager
but
when
compared
to
its
german
cousins
it
just
comes
up
a
little
short
for
me
great
oktoberfest
overall
this
is
pretty
bad
and
way
worse
than
last
year13
vs
14
i
know
its
almost
to
early
to
think
about
the
leaves
changing
colors
but
this
beer
does
just
that
the
amber
color
was
clean
and
head
great
with
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
nice
and
malty
on
the
front
end
the
taste
was
smooth
for
a
6
5
beer
and
finished
just
as
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
for
anyone
looking
to
drink
a
good
beer
i
will
get
another
six
pack
of
this
one
overall
a
fist
pumping

is

oktoberfest
from

co
i
implore
you
to
give
this
brew
a
chance
it
blew
me
away
obviously
this
brew
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
its
circulation
period
im
mostly
an
ipa
and
stout
enjoyer
i
know
thats
not
a
word
it
was
one
of
the
best
last
year
and
i
actually
think
this
years
brew
may
be
better
customer
feedback
was
great
ordered
one
case
last
year
sold
all
of
it
in
one
day
this
year
made
it
my
beer
of
the
week
sold
2
cases
in
3
days
i
should
have
order
more
than
5
cases
this
is
a
must
try
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
ive
seen
on
the
market
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
next
fall
and
run
to
the
store
before
its
all
gone
just
like
i
do
for
their
christmas
ale
o
see
first
line
back
up
the
truck
and
stock
up
the
fridge
great
tasting
american
oktoberfest
keep
on
hand
and
drink
frequently
repeat
at
will
different
than
german
marzens
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
damn
excellent
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
great
balance
between
the
malt
the
sweet
and
the
hops
definitely
getting
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
every
fall

pk
possibly
the
most
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
refreshing
and
easy
to

plenty
of
complexity
and
character
grab
it
if
you
see
it
i
know
i
will
be
travelling
to
bordering

to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
next
year
o
very

clear

light

medium

a
great

slightly
unique
example

one

the
best
americanmade
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
had
to
date
this
was
my
first
great
lakes
beer
and
i
will
certainly
be
trying
others
glad
they
are
now
being
distributed
in
nj
o
an
excellent
oktoberfest
great
with
a
grilled
cheese
sandwich
i
like
what
they
did
with
this
one
the
alcohol
was
good
too
and
although
i
only
had
one
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
have
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
its
not
easy
to
find
an
octoberfest
that
isnt
watereddown
generic
spicy
or
chewy
but
this
straddled
all
of
those
while
having
just
enough
to
it
to
stand
out
even
if
there
isnt
any
food
around
to
pair
it
with
this
is
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
on
its
own
overall
great
interpretation
of
the
style
nothing

clean
crisp
and
fulfillingan
oktoberfest
can
do
little
more
to
impress
outstanding
may
be
a
stretch
but
the
sum
of
its
parts
suggests
this
appellation
overall
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
its
not
super
complex
but
its
still
very
tasty
2013
sampling
this
again
against
a
dozen
other
oktoberfests
this
one
came
out
in
my
personal
top
3
very
fresh
and
true
to
style
with
its
own
unique
nutty
malt
character
and
lingering
flavors
highly
recommended
for
an
american
oktoberfest
that
upholds
tradition
im
a
fan
this
is
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
ive
had
so
far
ive
had
a
bunch
like
staghorn
as
well
as
the
typical
munich
brewers
takes
hofbräu
hacker
etc
and
this
holds
up
pretty
well
to
the
german
examples
im
guessing
that
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
in
the
usa
they
did
the
right
balance
on
this
although
an
experiment
of
a
bigger
version
would
be
cool
it
just
wouldnt
be
so
drinkable
i
think
during
the
indians
playoff
game
tomorrow
i
will
drink
several
of
these
and
see
it
they
are
as
drinkable
as
it
seems
try
it
for
sure
overall
a
charm
to
drink
there
are
so
many
oktoberfests
out
there
and
this
one
stacks
up
in
my
opinion
a
fullbodied
flavor
profile
makes
tasting
this
a
pleasure
the
beer
pours
an
off
white
and
slightly
tan
foam
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
beer
itself
is
a
beautiful
clear
copper
with
a
slight
orange
note
to
it
the
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
caramel
the
strong
malt
smell
also
gives
off
a
slight
honey
scent
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
strong
caramel
notes
with
a
side
of
honey
but
also
has
a
slight
hoppy
twist
at
the
end
of
it
which
is
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
with
very
little
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
a
bit
smooth
and
viscous
like
honey
overall
a
very
good
oktoberfest
and
one
worth
getting
when
available
o
a
great
autumn
beer
the
flavor
profile
and
artwork
will
get
you
in
the
mood
for
october
and
the
beers
that
come
along
with
it
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
an
octoberfest
brew
pretty
good
stuff
meng
served
too
cold
with
a
smallish
creamcolored
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
was
almost
nonexistent
probably
due
to
my
low
ability
to
smell
so
all
i
can
do
is
give
benefit
of
the
doubt
color
is
a
clear
copper
amber
flavors
very
nice
and
to
me
so
important
for
an
oktoberfest
not
too
sweet
it
is
malty
bread
cracker
some
tang
hint
of
bitter
roast
and
dry
bodycarbonation
excellent
esp
considering
temperature
finish
is
like
flavor
average
length
very
easy
drinking
solid
beer
i
have
adjusted
the
rating
up
maybe
slightly
higher
than
i
feel
overall
but
that
is
due
to
style
considerations
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
the
flavors
are
robust
it
doesnt
disappoint
if
you
like
beers
with
heavy
malt
this
is
the
one
to
try
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
i
have
tried
so
far
overall
an
extremely
good
oktoberfest
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
after
reading
the
reviews
i
was
on
the
lookout
nice
version
of
the
classic
german
marzen
the
colder
the
better
i
found
for
this
bottle
i
was
anxious
and
opened
the
first
one
a
tad
early
once
it
cooled
down
it
was
super
was
really
crisp
at
the
right
temperature
eager
to
try
it
on
tap
o
perfectly
blanced
an
easy
drinking
marzen
a
true
standout
92
o
id
out
this
one
near
the
top
of
the
style
up
there
with
ayinger
and
probably
the
best
american
version
ive
tried
lots
of
fruity
notes
with
the
toasted
sweet
malty
flavors
expected
of
the
style
my
favorite
oktoberfest
of
them
all
yes
i
am
quite
biased
in
favor
of
great
lakes
brewing
company
because
one
of
my
best
friends
worked
there
for
nine
years
and
ive
spent
many
a
fine
afternoonevening
at
the
place
but
my
preference
for
glbc
beer
is
primarily
because
the
beers
are
almost
always
outstanding
cheers
o
this
is
unusual
why
because
its
not
a
marzen
i
want
to
chug
its
a
marzen
i
want
to
savor
how
great
lakes
crams
so
much
fruity
flavor
into
their
lagers
ill
never
know
id
put
this
up
near
the
top
of
all
the
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
sampled
if
my
last
review
said
i
wouldnt
have
minded
getting
a
six
pack
of
the
beer
in
question
sts
2xrye
then
ill
state
in
this
i
kind
of
wish
i
got
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
single
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
oktoberfests
to
begin
with
but
even
by
oktoberfest
standards
this
is
unremarkable
the
peculiar
juiciness
is
distracting
and
theres
just
not
much
else
there
to
gravitate
toward
perhaps
my
least
favorite
offering
from
great
lakes
odefinitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
something
i
could
quaff
liters
of
if
at
a
festival
has
a
good
raw
beer
flavor
more
so
than
some
oktoberfests
and
is
also
a
bit
more
bitter
than
most
o
i
think
this
may
be
my
favorite
american
brewed
marzen
and
very
reasonably
priced
o
great
oktoberfest
here
a
definite
must
try
if
i
could
only
have
one
oktoberfest
beer
during
the
autumn
months
this
would
be
it
i
think
it
smelled
even
better
in
recent
years
but
otherwise
everything
comes
together
just
about
perfectly
here
it
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
toffee
the
malt
provides
flavors
of
bread
caramel
toffee
and
grass
and
the
hops
add
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
this
is
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
that
makes
it
crisp
overall
this
isnt
an
overly
powerful
beer
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
is
complex
o
a
rich
full
flavor
brew
with
wonderful
toasted
malt
character
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
long
lasting
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
noble
hops
and
caramel
malt
body
is
full
and
smooth
caramel
malt
and
some
cherry
are
balanced
on
the
palate
by
herbal
hops
finish
is
long
semidry
nice
oktoberfest
i
was
completely
blown
away
with
this
one
some
nice
sweetness
to
it
and
great
toasted
bread
notes
such
a
pleasant
surprise
even
from
the
first
taste
i
just
had
a
flying
fish
oktober
fish
last
week
id
say
this
great
lakes
version
is
much
better
if
i
could
choose
an
oktoberfest
to
rest
upon
this
fall
this
would
be
the
one
tastefeel
i
wouldnt
call
this
outstanding
but
id
consider
it
very
good
first
the
feel
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
that
is
nearly
perfect
and
my
favorite
part
of
this
oktoberfest
the
beer
itself
is
perfectly
true
to
the
style
except
for
the
fact
that
i
get
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
on
the
end
that
puts
me
off
just
a
little
bit
a
touch
sweeter
than
it
is
bitter
which
i
like
in
my
oktoberfests
a
super
solid
example
of
the
style
and
my
first
oktoberfest
of
the
year
tasty
beer
oa
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
as
i
prefer
my
marzens
with
more
carmelized
roasted
malt
character
with
a
bit
more
body
though
a
bit
onedimensional
great
lakes
makes
a
great
fest
thats
rich
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
going
on
my
short
list
of
top
oktoberfest
beers
taste
is
almost
like
the
smell
sweet
malt
caramel
and
light
toasted
bread
light
spiciness
of
noble
hops
also
gives
so
earthiness
to
this
beer
finishes
dry
making
you
want
another
drink
not
my
favorite
style
and
perhaps
the
fact
this
is
a
different
take
makes
it
as
good
of
fall
seasonal
as
ive
had
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
nice
example
of
the
style
d
not
a
bad
marzen
oktoberfest
by
any
means
however
im
not
sure
this
one
leaves
up
to
the
high
expectations
i
had
for
it
based
on
my
fellow
bas
ratings
ill
have
no
issue
getting
through
the
sixer
that
i
have
in
the
fridge
but
there
are
more
than
a
handful
of
other
style
brethren
both
german
and
domestic
that
i
would
opt
for
over
this
one
when
given
the
choice
i
love
this
beer
and
want
to
buy
it
every
year
oenjoyable
but
too
sweet
and
light
i
still
have
the
other
5
bottles
of
the
6pack
and
will
try
12
by
themselves
and
use
the
rest
to
make
snakebites
a
tamer
version
of
the
märzen
style
and
better
than
many
but
not
really
comparable
to
german
offerings

o
this
is
the
beer
and
style
to
drink
went
you
just
want
a
good
solid
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
oktoberfest
style
very
well
done
loverly
orange
creature
thick
oily
lacing
and
ample
head
the
nose
is
nice
the
taste
is
fantastic
malt
hops
grains
dried
hay
yes
i
taste
dried
hay
pepper
very
nice
brew
slightly
oily
moutfeel
on
this
wonderful
beverage
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
grab
one
if
you
get
a
chance
very
appropriate
fall
tastes
and
smells
come
alive
in
this
oktoberfest
beer
and
its
certainly
worth
a
crisp
cool
night
to
try
it
tasty
oktoberfest
but
i
cant
figure
out
why
the
community
would
rate
this
higher
than
most
germans
a
very
good
stab
at
it
for
craft
beer
o
great
lakes
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
edmund
fitzgerald
porter
is
my
favorite
but
this
oktoberfest
comes
in
a
close
second
if
you
enjoy
the
marzen
oktoberfest
style
then
this
one
is
a
must
try
too
bad
my
local
beverage
outlet
couldnt
get
this
in
a
16th
keg
for
me
so
i
had
to
settle
with
buying
a
case
this
is
so
good
im
not
sure
if
theres
a
better
oktoberfest
on
the
market
today
at
least
not
one
that
ive
tried
the
smell
is
very
very
light
and
i
can
only
make
out
something
bready
however
it
works
so
well
with
the
sweet
and
spicy
taste
it
really
is
excellent
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
overall
i
had
all
but
given
up
on
oktoberfest
beers
but
gave
this
one
a
shot
just
for
the
respect
i
have
for
the
brewery
this
one
gives
me
everything
i
want
in
an
oktoberfest
and
works
well
on
a
way
too
cold
summer
day
beautiful
dark
orange
copper
color
with
small
offwhite
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
has
nice
mixture
of
caramel
malts
sweet
fruitiness
and
light
hops
flavor
is
great
smooth
and
malty
with
sweet
caramel
light
spices
and
a
light
fruitiness
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
great
all
around
one
of
the
freshest
bottles
ive
had
drinking
this
the
first
week
its
out
way
too
early
for
fall
but
its
delicious
o
again
simply
the
benchmark
for
this
style
of
beer
if
your
into
marzens
try
this
one
it
will
not
disappoint
cheers
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thick
2
finger
off
white
head
lacing
all
over
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
this
thing
smells
like
the
fall
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
spices
sweet
roasted
caramel
the
taste
is
quite
good
as
well
the
malt
is
sweet
but
has
a
nice
round
edge
of
earthyness
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
you
can
find
its
as
drinkable
with
maximum
flavor
as
you
can
get
add
to
that
the
great
price
at
8
99
a
sixer
and
you
got
a
winning
fall
release
my
only
complaint
is
its
far
to
early
to
have
this
out
sitting
on
the
shelves
mid
august
would
do
just
fine
hopefully
they
will
keep
releasing
this
until
the
end
so
fresh
batches
are
still
circulating
o
this
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
from
great
lakes
i
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
you
should
too
autumn
seasonal
with
an
est
195
calories
per
bottle
and
6
5
abv
an
amber
lager
with
the
flavor
of
a
slight
herbal
grassy
taste
i
am
rating
this
low
because
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
would
recommend
if
your
a
fan
of
amber
lager
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
the
aftertaste
is
almost
as
bitter
as
an
ipa
notes
i
think
they
nailed
this
one
perhaps
they
should
bottle
this
one
for
their
seasonal
rotation
medium
bodied
with
an
effervescence
that
is
a
bit
sharp
upfront
but
mellowed
quickly
not
my
favorite
great
lakes
beer
not
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
a
decent
beer
overall
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
beer
im
not
too
well
versed
in
ofests
or
marzens
but
this
beer
is
great
in
fact
its
quite
a
bit
different
than
many
of
the
other
oktoberfests
i
have
had
very
ambiguous
yet
very
familiar
all
at
the
same
time
a
nice
collection
of
flavors
from
the
abundance
of
malts
this
beer
also
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
if
you
can
hold
onto
it
for
that
long
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
malt
complexity
is
spot
on
and
the
warmth
is
a
welcome
accompaniment
the
citrus
flavor
is
a
touch
overdone
mouthfeel
this
is
a
smooth
medium
bodied
oktoberfest
that
is
easy
drinking
yet
has
plenty
of
flavors
to
go
around
o
a
head
above
sam
adams
oktoberfest
but
not
overly
outstanding
o
best
american
oktoberfest
ive
had
fuller
medium
body
well
carbonated
creamy
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
really
well
balanced
and
crafted
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
right
now
among
the
cacophony
of
johann
schrammel
blaring
in
the
background
and
the
merry
yells
of
the
festival
crowds
she
crosses
your
sight
shes
a
voluptuous
beauty
whos
had
her
share
of
brezen
weisswurts
and
obatzda
but
she
perfectly
fills
out
her
dirndl
in
full
among
all
these
marzens
what
is
it
about
this
one
that
has
you
hiding
the
bulge
in
your
lederhosen
her
dark
copper
color
helps
her
stand
out
from
the
rest
as
she
pours
into
your
glass
with
the
thickness
you
expected
as
soon
as
you
bring
her
to
your
lips
she
surrounds
you
with
a
warm
comfort
both
familiar
and
unfamiliar
at
the
same
time
her
aroma
matches
evenly
with
her
sweet
taste
she
is
ready
for
fun
and
her
hearty
laugh
makes
you
smile
with
each
sip
after
unraveling
the
strings
on
her
dirndl
blouse
and
voraciously
dropping
to
her
knees
you
are
overwhelmed
with
her
lascivious
mouthfeel
but
also
a
looming
sorrow
this
tryst
will
last
but
a
few
days
alas
octoberfest
wasnt
meant
to
last
all
year
so
grab
her
by
her
thick
curves
and
dive
in
head
first
you
might
as
well
shes
been
patiently
waiting
for
you
all
year
with
a
tankard
in
one
hand
and
a
motel
key
in
the
other
as
the
bacchanalia
comes
to
a
close
she
quietly
slips
away
into
the
munich
night
the
memories
of
the
copious
merriment
she
leaves
behind
can
only
find
their
match
in
grandeur
in
the
moist
spot
she
left
behind
on
the
bed
you
shared
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
approaching
cloying
it
drinks
stronger
than
its
6
5
and
is
more
of
a
sipper
my
idea
of
an
oktoberfest
is
a
flavorful
beer
than
can
be
drunk
in
liters
and
this
isnt
it
flavor
starts
with
a
slight
herbal
grassy
flavor
that
gives
way
to
a
sweeter
caramel
malt
and
slightly
metallic
finish
the
feel
is
extremely
creamy
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
amber
color
topped
by
a
tight
creamy
looking
head
that
leaves
sticky
rings
behind
before
the
first
sip
clean
aromas
of
mild
sweet
bread
and
subtle
earthiness
sweet
malty
flavor
again
clean
and
lagery
dough
some
toast
nuttiness
and
a
flicker
of
leafy
hops
medium
bodied
and
nicely
smooth
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
for
the
style
but
i
think
i
could
suck
down
a
liter
or
two
without
much
trouble
the
beer
is
orange
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malts
lager
scents
smells
appropriate
for
the
style
albeit
a
bit
sweet
the
flavor
is
ok
a
bit
grainy
and
sweet
but
also
flavorful
and
enjoyable
notes
of
gourds
squash
a
tad
syrupy
on
the
palate
with
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
although
one
was
plenty
o
great
lakes
has
struck
gold
with
their
spoton
rendition
of
this
german
lager
which
expertly
marries
different
malts
which
blend
to
perfection
with
superb
drinkability
but
are
also
allowed
to
develop
and
contribute
different
nuances
its
rich
without
being
overthetop
a
hearty
malty
oktoberfest
which
demands
you
drink
it
by
the
liter
mouthfeel
true
medium
body
with
complexity
a
refreshing
lightness
flanks
the
palate
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
foamy
12
inch
offwhite
head
lasts
for
a
while
and
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
really
extraordinary
a
strong
hint
of
sweet
fruit
chocolate
malt
really
nice
the
taste
is
also
sweet
hints
of
raisin
or
dark
chocolate
hoppy
very
clean
crisp
taste
perfect
for
a
marzen
i
find
with
oktoberfests
carbonation
is
the
x
factor
in
making
a
brew
a
hit
or
a
miss
the
carbonation
in
this
one
is
really
pretty
perfect
just
a
really
pleasant
solid
beer
very
easy
to
drink
my
bottle
has
a
please
enjoy
by
date
of
102512
puchased
and
consumed
on
92412
theres
also
10203de
stamped
below
the
date
no
indication
of
what
thats
for
though
overall
i
am
starting
to
really
enjoy
the
fall
season
for
its
octoberfest
beers
and
great
lakes
brewing
company
makes
arguably
one
of
the
best
definitely
pick
is
up
if
you
get
the
chance
good
sweetness
with
some
spice
and
bready
flavors
a
great
marzen
i
am
not
huge
on
the
style
but
i
can
not
think
of
a
better
one
brewed
out
of
germany
looks
like
a
101212
best
by
date
overall
not
what
i
would
normally
expect
when
thinking
about
an
oktoberfest
but
still
a
wonderful
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
an
extremely
well
done
oktoberfest
has
a
nice
little
bump
in
the
abv
compared
to
more
traditional
marzens
also
has
a
slightly
drying
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
refreshing
prost
overall
way
too
much
herbalfarm
type
flavour
for
me
maybe
its
spot
on
for
the
style
but
it
just
isnt
enjoyable
not
something
id
buy
again
o
this
is
a
great
oktoberfest
a
step
up
from
the
stand
by
sam
adams
but
very
different
and
very
enjoyable
overall
this
ranks
right
up
there
the
fall
octoberfest
brews
out
there
with
fall
in
the
air
this
great
lakes
beer
is
a
real
treat
beer
lovers
solid
clean
drinker
alcohol
nowhere
to
be
found
about
right
amount
of
carbonation
almost
mid
bodied
though
there
is
just
more
to
this
than
many
which
makes
it
pretty
excellent
o
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
o
despite
the
too
sweet
taste
this
beer
remains
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
its
just
average
but
for
great
lakes
i
am
a
little
let
down
since
i
like
all
their
beers
so
much
this
is
my
favorite
octoberfest
that
i
have
tasted
this
season
o
a
super
solid
american
oktoberfest
definitely
my
goto
oktoberfest
during
the
fall
since
its
cheap
and
delicious
o
fantastic
beer
bummer
that
it
is
seasonal
no
wonder
its
a
gold
medal
beer
enjoy
it
while
you
can
get
it
great
balanced
beer
with
some
nuance
drinkable
little
marzen
would
certainly
be
a
good
addition
to
an
oktoberfest
evening
d
a
very
good
beer
and
my
first
marzen
of
the
season
not
a
bad
way
to
start
things
off
if
a
bit
early
overall
very
easy
drinking
with
some
wonderful
tastes
as
well
as
a
nice
smooth
feel
quite
nice
flavor
is
full
of
wonderful
toasted
biscuits
nuts
and
subtle
spice
i
have
no
words
to
describe
how
good
this
beer
is
medium
body
with
a
lighter
touch
of
carbonation
and
incredibly
smooth
there
is
a
lingering
toasted
caramel
flavor
in
the
finish
that
sits
in
the
corners
of
your
mouth
and
under
your
tongue
i
want
more
i
need
more
the
best
märzen
that
i
have
ever
had
by
far
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
best
before
1062012
pours
lightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
fairly
dense
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
pear
biscuit
toast
herbal
floral
and
light
earthy
spiciness
very
nice
and
well
balanced
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
biscuit
toast
caramel
pear
herbal
floral
grass
and
earthy
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
caramel
biscuit
pear
herbal
and
grass
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
very
nice
flavor
balance
and
robustness
fairly
clean
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
nice
creamy
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
pretty
much
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
oktoberfest
great
flavor
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
an
easy
winner
nicely
done
up
to
the
style
not
quite
what
i
remember
this
beer
to
be
while
sitting
in
the
pub
about
10
years
ago
but
maybe
its
just
the
time
and
place
a
well
done
fest
beer
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
to
date
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
these
this
fall
season
its
inoffensive
but
not
remarkable
for
style
there
are
better
options
for
the
style
overall
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
and
i
can
see
why
its
one
of
the
best
great
lakes
scores
again
overall
i
was
impressed
by
the
unoffending
taste
and
drinkability
after
the
nose
was
so
sharp
will
be
purchasing
more
in
the
fall
this
is
a
solid
marzen
with
great
flavor
and
drinkability
it
has
rich
caramel
but
its
not
sticky
there
is
somce
faint
hop
character
that
offers
balance
this
is
an
all
around
solid
offering
overall
a
very
good
beer
differing
from
other
ofest
beers
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
glb
o
its
just
a
big
beer
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
pretty
good
beer
i
poured
this
one
into
a
perfect
pint
it
has
a
nice
golden
brown
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
that
quicky
lays
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
inviting
of
carmel
and
malt
and
some
hops
with
a
hint
of
clove
the
taste
is
well
balanced
taste
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
the
spicy
bitter
hops
comes
through
in
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
great
smooth
and
creamy
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
defintly
the
best
marzen
i
have
had
so
far
o
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
up
for
the
underwhelming
nose
on
this
one
unlike
some
other
glbc
seasonal
beers
though
im
glad
this
one
isnt
available
year
round
because
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
very
often
the
marzen
just
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
having
a
few
times
a
year
do
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
are
most
beers
of
this
style
i
believe
that
part
of
the
idea
of
this
style
is
to
be
very
drinkable
4
5
smells
of
rich
maltsstrong
for
a
lager
bits
of
spice
and

the
taste
is
a
malt
explosion
with
tons
of
hop
and
spice
smooth
and
medium
bodied
lots
of
flavor
and
taste
this
is
a
fantastic
marzen
wow
what
flavor
and
complexity
this
beer
has
this
is
a
damn
good
lagergotta
try
it
if
marzens
are
your
taste
o
gl
brew
exceptional
beers
and
they
do
lagers
just
about
better
than
anyone
gl
okto
is
no
exception
its
down
right
tasty
im
upset
that
i
didnt
spring
for
another
sixer
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
had
really
good
so
much
going
on
but
all
the
pieces
fit
together
so
well
awesome
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
true
to
style
but
also
unique
toastier
than
most
oktoberfests
and
also
more
bitter
but
just
as
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
the
autumn
malt
character
you
would
want
o
definitely
my
favorite
marzen
of
the
7
or
8
i
have
tried
this
season
previously
it
was
brooklyn
octoberfest
but
this
one
does
the
job
well
it
has
unique
flavor
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
great
lakes
another
great
beer
from
them
o
overall
an
incredible
oktoberfest
and
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
in
a
long
time
dont
expect
this
to
blow
your
mind
in
the
way
a
crazy
imperial
kitchensink
beer
will
this
is
more
subtle
but
incredibly
satisfying
an
excellent
brew
all
around
and
one
ill
certainly
be
revisiting
annually
perhaps
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
on
this
one
as
the
overall
score
is
higher
than
all
of
the
other
categories
except
appearance
o
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
lot
of
quality
marzens
this
season
and
this
is
certainly
in
the
top
tier
it
has
a
lot
of
character
and
depth
especially
for
the
style
slightly
disappointing
perhaps
this
one
was
brewed
too
early
in
the
season
and
its
showing
signs
of
shelf
abuse
a
casualty
of
the
creepingearliereachyear
seasonal
beer
release
epidemic
i
would
consider
trying
this
again
on
draft
or
at
least
closer
to
the
bottling
date
pours
out
a
copper
hue
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
has
really
wonderful
lacing
and
retention
in
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
fairly
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
it
the
smell
is
the
usual
oktoberfest
of
caramel
grains
and
fruits
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
nice
mix
of
caramel
fruits
apples
and
pears
grass
and
sweet
breads
with
hints
of
hops
that
stay
from
the
first
sip
til
the
end
of
the
drink
a
very
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
crisp
clean
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
dry
finish
to
it
overall
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
tasted
and
highly
recommended
for
anyone
that
wants
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
overall
this
is
a
nice
ofest
type
of
lager
its
nice
to
have
great
lakes
available
in
my
area
and
even
though
its
a
bit
more
spendy
than
the
usual
suspects
i
usually
quaff
its
nice
to
be
able
to
try
new
twists
on
a
style
that
can
get
rather
boring
to
me
after
awhile
recommended
o
i
call
bullshit
on
the
b
overall
average
this
is
my
new
fall
go
to
nonpumpkin
beer
for
sure
i
give
two
schlitz
for
this
welldone
lager
prosit
great
lakes
oktoberfest
is
a
super
clear
sparkling
amber
lager
with
a
thin
soft
dense
yellowish
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
like
bread
and
pretzels
theres
a
medicinal
or
minty
note
to
it
theres
a
fruity
whiff
to
it
kind
of
like
apples
its
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
a
sharp
lively
finish
it
leaves
the
palate
pretty
clean
the
flavor
hovers
between
sweet
and
dry
with
malt
taking
the
center
stage
its
a
little
resiny
melanoidal
fruity
and
medicinal
the
flavors
come
together
pretty
well
and
nothing
seems
out
of
balance
this
is
one
of
the
most
sessionable
oktoberfests
i
can
recall
drinking
its
october
and
i
am
trying
great
lakes
oktoberfest
and
it
is
ok
no
question
it
is
a
marzen
style
beer
the
appearance
is
a
rich
clear
amber
with
thick
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
there
is
not
much
smell
other
than
typical
sweet
malt
grain
the
taste
is
ok
not
sure
if
i
like
the
sweetness
or
not
there
is
a
nice
malt
base
that
helps
to
keep
the
beer
grounded
the
abv
initially
is
a
bit
much
but
after
a
few
swigs
one
begins
to
settle
in
6
5
is
a
bit
much
for
a
marzen
so
the
mouthfeel
is
downgraded
slightly
overall
its
decent
better
than
most
o
great
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
can
really
see
why
so
many
love
this
brew
a
very
good
example
of
the
american
oktoberfest
style
o
easy
drinker
great
one
to
curl
up
with
on
a
cold
evening
this
is
what
an
oktoberfest
should
be
like
well
worth
the
effort
to
seek
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
levels
overall
a
good
brew
reviewed
the
bottled
version
earlier
and
really
dont
think
theres
many
differences
the
draft
smells
better
but
doesnt
look
as
good
either
way
a
great
oktoberfest
that
is
readily
available
in
my
area
and
im
definitely
appreciative
of
that
o
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
outstanding
beautiful
the
nose
was
mild
but
interesting
the
flavor
was
full
of
character
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
too
the
victory
festbier
wasnt
bad
but
this
was
better
one
of
my
new
favorites
all
in
all
i
have
tried
many
oktoberfests
and
have
only
really
cared
for
a
handful
of
them
this
is
one
of
that
handful
o
this
is
great
stuff
ive
really
come
to
appreciate
this
style
during
this
season
largely
due
to
this
beer
this
is
my
goto
fall
beer
for
sure
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
an
easy
beer
to
drink
not
to
heavy
and
not
overly
strong
luckily
i
have
five
more
to
drink
o
it
has
the
malty
and
rich
flavor
yet
it
packs
a
punch
at
the
back
of
your
tongue
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
version
says
step
yo
game
up
to
other
versions
of
the
fall
classic
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
and
id
give
it
a
big
hell
ya
overy
good
beer
has
great
balance
and
flavor
provides
alot
of
different
flavors
without
allowing
one
to
overwhelm
the
other
and
remains
extremely
drinkable
highly
recommend
o
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
out
this
year
balanced
and
delicious
would
like
some
more
sweet
malty
flavors
but
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
very
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
marzen
one
of
the
best
american
versions
out
there
overall
a
good
solid
beer
fall
beer
in
a
classic
style
brilliantly
clear
orange
amber
color
with
limited
head
retention
toasty
and
sweet
malt
aromas
carry
over
very
accurately
to
the
palate
with
sweet
and
toasty
malt
flavors
that
are
balanced
very
well
by
slight
bitterness
the
sweet
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
but
tapers
off
before
becoming
cloying
moderate
carbonation
makes
this
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
very
rewarding
flavor
profile
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
the
best
marzen
i
have
sampled
this
autumn
or
any
other
o
an
easy
quaffer
but
one
with
some
flavor
probably
what
every
octoberfest
should
be
o
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
only
way
it
could
get
better
would
be
if
i
was
in
a
beer
garden
on
a
fall
day
o
goes
down
easy
could
probably
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
might
not
be
the
best
of
the
great
lakes
offerings
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
fall
seasonals
i
have
had
this
year
would
certainly
buy
it
again
o
a
delicious
example
of
the
style
it
pairs
well
with
grilled
sausages
and
kraut
its
next
to
impossible
to
only
drink
one
at
a
sitting
as
good
as
it
is
from
the
bottle
its
even
better
on
draft
while
i
enjoy
the
summer
wheats
im
always
chomping
at
the
bit
to
get
to
the
autumn
beers
and
this
one
dominates
as
a
fridge
favorite
because
its
fuller
and
more
complex
than
many
of
its
brethren
its
outstanding
more
aggressive
and
complex
than
most
others
of
the
style
i
think
its
delightful
o
a
really
enjoy
this
beer
that
said
it
comes
through
a
lot
better
in
my
opinion
on
tap
still
worthy
out
of
the
bottle
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
ever
had
ive
always
thought
that
great
lakes
was
slightly
overrated
as
they
have
never
really
impressed
me
other
than
their
edmond
fitzgerald
porter
but
this
beer
makes
me
understand
how
great
they
are
i
will
respect
them
more
from
now
on
and
be
more
open
to
try
their
beers
drinkability
this
is
easily
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
manufactured
in
the
us
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
consume
its
simple
straight
to
the
point
on
style
and
literally
transported
me
back
to
munich
this
is
one
of
the
strongest
oktoberfest
style
beers
ive
had
at
6
5
alcvol
although
you
dont
notice
it
right
away
because
its
has
been
masked
behind
some
big
bold
flavors
if
you
havent
ever
been
to
the
great
lakes
brewing
co
in
cleveland
its
a
must
as
you
walk
in
it
gives
an
immediate
feel
of
comfort
that
the
german
gausthaus
does
next
time
we
go
i
plan
on
getting
a
room
for
the
night
to
do
a
little
more
drinking
great
lakes
oktoberfest
pours
a
crystal
clear
burnt
orange
lightening
in
spots
to
straight
orange
when
held
up
to
light
theres
about
two
fingers
of
ivory
foam
topping
the
beer
but
it
fades
quickly
and
without
a
trace
the
nose
has
prominent
notes
of
toasted
bread
and
nuts
with
some
caramel
and
a
lightly
herbalspicy
hop
presence
in
the
mix
as
well
those
four
fill
out
the
flavor
profile
as
well
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
subdued
the
caramel
a
bit
elevated
and
bitterness
is
barely
there
but
the
general
idea
from
the
aroma
is
the
same
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
bit
too
crisp
which
im
chalking
up
to
a
body
thats
a
touch
on
the
light
side
id
like
the
beer
to
be
a
bit
more
rounded
and
full
a
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
id
drink
this
one
again
sits
atop
my
list
of
beers
of
this
style
perfect
for
a
midseptembers
night
in
the
midwest
very
tasty
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
reminds
me
of
ginger
snaps
or
boston
brown
bread
the
sweetness
is
perfectany
more
and
it
would
be
cloying
noble
style
hops
stay
in
the
background
and
present
balance
thick
bready
malt
provides
a
solid
foundation
for
this
excellent
beer
just
doesnt
seem
well
constructed
to
me
flavors
arent
that
well
integrated
and
the
malt
profile
is
not
terribly
complex
doesnt
strike
me
as
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
this
one
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
im
sure
a
lot
of
people
can
fix
in
their
minds
this
as
their
perfect
beer
but
for
a
brewer
to
actually
pull
it
off
is
something
different
bravo
gentleman
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
very
drinkable
perfect
for
fall
it
is
sweeter
than
many
of
the
oktoberfests
i
have
had
and
it
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
of
them
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
6
5
abv
is
masked
turning
this
into
a
dangerous
session
seasonal
lager
great
brew
to
have
from
the
bottle
or
on
draft
overall
this
was
a
solid
oktoberfest
offering
good
but
nothing
overly
special
about
it
would
have
loved
more
some
more
body
on
this
beer
one
good
marzen
o
a
decent
marzen
though
a
bit
on
the
bland
and
watery
side
for
my
tastes
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
should
probably
complete
an
entirely
new
review
but
in
the
interest
of
time
and
the
fact
that
while
i
hope
some
have
found
a
review
or
two
of
mine
useful
theyre
mainly
to
help
me
keep
track
of
beers
ive
had
having
said
all
of
that
my
previous
score
for
gl
oktoberfest
was
a
3
63
after
having
enjoyed
this
fine
beer
again
a
year
later
the
experience
was
quite
a
bit
different
this
was
one
of
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
do
not
believe
my
palate
has
changed
that
much
in
a
year
perhaps
the
beer
last
year
was
past
its
prime
whatever
the
case
this
beer
had
wonderful
balance
feel
and
top
notch
drinkability
excellent
beer
do
with
the
exception
of
a
touch
of
fruitiness
a
very
clean
and
drinkable
oktoberfest
hard
to
believe
it
6
5
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
easy
drinking
and
tasty
overall
absolutely
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
its
starting
to
get
a
little
colder
and
you
need
a
little
more
weight
than
all
those
easydrinking
summer
beers
dont
jump
into
the
dark
stuff
just
yet
great
lakes
oktoberfest
is
filling
the
slot
in
the
end
of
lager
season
not
bad
more
toasty
sweet
than
malty
not
sure
why
everyone
loves
this
so
much
i
mean
its
good
but
not
great
which
is
surprising
since
i
really
liked
their
vienna
lager
o
very
easy
drinking
beer
great
beer
for
the
fall
and
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
oktoberfest
i
have
ever
had
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
style
that
has
grown
on
me
some
over
the
years
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
i
cant
resist
throwing
a
couple
in
my
mixed
sixers
everytime
im
at
the
store
for
fans
of
the
style
seek
this
out
this
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
rocky
bright
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
minerals
and
mild
noble
hops
the
taste
is
malty
but
not
overpowering
there
is
a
nice
lingering
breadiness
with
some
toffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
oktoberfest
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
m
the
beer
is
bold
a
rich
lager
perfect
for
the
oncoming
crispness
in
the
air
as
for
tonight
it
held
up
well
during
a
rain
storm
too
overall
a
very
very
good
octoberfest
perhaps
the
best
ive
had
to
date
excellent
effort
by
great
lakes
o
great
lakes
oktoberfest
is
a
damn
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
the
roasty
bitterness
i
associate
with
the
style
is
balanced
by
a
mild
toffee
and
honey
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
a
very
enjoyable
experience
and
dare
i
say
it
quite
sessionable
great
job
great
lakes
overall
best
oktoberfeststyle
beer
ive
had
so
far
and
a
fantastic
fall
seasonal
supremely
drinkable
flavorful
sessionable
just
good
all
around
get
it
flavor
is
very
good
and
represents
the
style
nicely
sampled
from
a

semidry
with
a
light

and
sweet
bready
aftertaste
mellow
and
delicate
with
nice
aromas
texture
and
flavors
overall
one
of
the
better
american
interpritations
of
the
style
a
great
oktoberfest
with
that
full
body
that
most
lack
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
copper
color
and
reminded
me
of
the
first
beer
i
had
in
germany
30
years
ago
not
the
same
style
of
beer
but
the
same
experience
wonderful
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
not
a
hop
head
so
this
is
a
great
beer
for
me
the
great
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
finish
brought
memories
of
munich
my
first
bucket
list
entry
is
to
be
there
for
oktoberfest
trink
trink
bruderlein
trink
this
one
gets
better
as
it
gets
warmer
the
flavors
are
really
malty
and
complex
a
very
solid
fall
beer
one
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
in
the
future
o
overall
a
disappointment
i
actually
prefer
eliot
ness
to
this
as
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
sharper
flavor
profile
quite
honestly
this
just
tastes
like
an
average
lager
to
me
ill
give
it
a
b
but
no
more
this
is
a
fine
oktoberfest
tons
of
great
and
traditional
flavor
and
aroma
characteristics
and
a
very
nice
introduction
to
the
fall
i
wont
waste
anyones
time
with
my
awful
astmo
notes
what
i
will
say
is
that
this
was
the
third
marzen
i
enjoyed
that
evening
and
it
was
by
far
the
best
in
terms
of
quality
i
liken
the
glbc
oktoberfest
to
spaten
compared
to
many
other
oktoberfest
beers
this
one
has
a
depth
that
can
accompany
you
into
the
chilly
nights
of
fall
o
a
classic
best
american
version
of
this
i
have
seen
gl
continues
to
amaze
me
they
have
tied
founders
in
my
book
as
having
the
most
solid
lineup
of
amazing
beers
in
their
stable
great
great
lakes
has
really
been
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
so
i
was
so
exited
to
try
their
oktoberfest
it
did
not
disappoint
this
is
always
the
first
oktoberfest
i
grab
when
the
season
hits
o
such
a
simple
beer
but
everything
is
done
so
well
and
it
drinks
so
easy
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
the
label
describes
this
beer
as
the
noble
brother
of
the
vienna
lager
and
thats
a
great
way
to
describe
it
this
will
be
a
nice
complement
to
the
other
maltysweet
marzens
that
youll
be
enjoying
in
the
fall
mouth
feel
and
overall
the
growler
pour
tastes
a
little
more
alcoholic
than
the
bottled
version
i
remember
from
last
year
i
anticipate
finding
this
years
bottle
release
crisp
and
refreshing
light
bodied
mostly
except
for
randomntastes
of
stronger
alcohol
im
going
to
pick
this
up
again
soon
this
years
version
of
great
lakes
oktoberfest
is
absolutely
glorious
it
actually
is
a
bit
less
aggressive
than
years
past
but
in
a
great
way
as
oktoberfests
neednt
be
overly
aggressive
pours
a
copper
oft
reddish
colour
with
some
thin
lacing
down
the
glass
head
sticks
for
about
30
seconds
then
creeps
down
smells
of
burnt
caramel
and
some
slight
breadlike
toffee
tastes
outstanding
very
malty
with
some
bitterness
to
balance
though
mainly
malty
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
very
clean
and
crisp
you
wonder
where
it
went
drinkability
is
great
and
i
need
to
be
careful
this
beer
is
lethal
cheers
and
glad
its
almost
fall
amazing
must
try
i
had
this
yesterday
on
tap
in
louisville
at
maggy
malones
it
arrived
a
light
bodied
rich
pumpkin
orange
in
color
with
a
one
finger
soft
and
creamy
off
white
head
it
gave
aromas
of
light
caramel
malts
light
bready
malts
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
a
nice
touch
of
honey
it
had
a
great
nose
for
an
oktoberfest
the
flavors
mimicked
the
aromas
and
it
was
very
appealing
for
the
style
it
was
a
little
bolder
than
the
every
day
marzen
it
was
really
apparent
how
fresh
the
keg
was
having
just
arrived
a
few
days
earlier
the
flavors
were
sharp
and
on
point
it
drank
very
light
and
was
ultimately
smooth
this
was
definitely
aided
by
being
on
draft
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
marzen
grab
it
while
its
fresh
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
brews
ive
ever
had
overall
one
of
the
best
fall
seasonal
ive
had
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
put
this
in
my
rotation
o
overall
it
is
my
fave
beer
style
and
was
a
bit
put
out
as
great
lakes
usually
do
things
very
good
and
well
received
but
this
one
while
good
on
the
average
is
still
a
bit
light
for
me
great
lakes
oktoberfest
is
an
amber
colored
lager
with
a
frothy
white
head
as
its
crown
the
aroma
is
a
spot
on
marzen
nose
rich
malts
kind
of
yeasty
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
background
wow
the
flavor
explodes
onto
the
scene
the
minute
it
hits
the
tongue
very
nice
and
rich
malts
fairly
spicy
hops
somewhat
bready
a
bit
earthy
very
full
mouthfeel
notes
for
the
style
this
is
the
best
hands
down
i
have
ever
had
it
is
just
the
odd
grassy
note
i
get
that
is
keeping
me
from
saying
it
is
world
class
but
otherwise
i
really
do
enjoy
it
i
buy
a
sixer
every
fall
and
am
happy
to
do
so
great
falltime
party
beer
as
well
notes
this
beer
is
moderate
in
body
full
of
flavor
and
incredibly
balanced
at
6
5
abv
its
hardly
noticeable
drinkability
is
awesome
this
might
be
my
favorite
american
interpretation
of
the
style
to
date
an
amazing
brew
despite
my
gripes
this
beer
is
still
a
firstrate
example
of
the
style
delicious
i
will
buy
this
again
it
is
my
favorite
domestic
oktoberfest
o
i
have
had
a
few
oktoberfest
brews
in
my
life
and
i
must
say
i
cant
name
one
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
tastes
better
its
a
world
class
marzenoktoberfest
brew
a
slight
resemblance
to
their
vienna
lager
but
a
lot
different
when
it
comes
down
to
the
experience
glbc
does
it
again
and
then
again
with
this
one
this
is
my
oktoberfest
of
choice
when
i
buy
this
style
it
will
be
glbc
overall
a
very
good
marzen
perfect
for
fall
d
glad
im
already
kicking
off
the
ofest
season
good
drinking
beer
but
there
are
some
other
oktoberfests
im
a
bigger
fan
of
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
great
lakes
pulls
it
off
again
kudos
to
you
notes
what
is
amazing
absent
is
the
alcohol
i
do
not
taste
anything
resembling
alcohol
and
i
am
actually
very
happy
about
that
o
very
good
great
lakes
does
a
great
job
and
i
think
ill
certainly
come
back
to
this
one
this
brew
has
great
taste
d
very
drinkable
oktoberfest
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
i
recommend
this
brew
and
will
for
sure
get
it
again
t
this
has
a
unique
very
strong
almost
grape
sweet
taste
to
it
rye
aftertaste
very
nice
blend
of
fruitiness
and
bitter
hops
d
highly
drinkable
this
and
ayinger
are
my
favorite
oktoberfests
this
year
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beers
wish
they
made
it
year
round
beer
has
a
medium
body
nice
american
style
of
a
german
märzen
good
session
beer
bought
at
total
wine
in
greensboro
north
carolina
high
point
approximately
late
fall
2010
drank
mid
january
2011
and
still
fairly
nice
give
it
up
to
great
lakes
12oz
bottle
usually
poured
into
dimple
glass
pours
a
nice
solid
golden
color
not
quite
copper
but
note
quite
straight
gold
the
nose
gives
the
first
indication
that
this
example
is
going
to
be
stylistically
excellent
hints
of
rich
malt
and
a
touch
of
german
noble
hops
come
through
flavors
coming
through
on
the
palate
are
equally
splendid
munich
malty
goodness
is
prevalent
rendering
one
with
the
feeling
of
walking
through
a
beer
garden
in
munich
the
finish
is
mediumdry
allowing
for
a
high
level
of
drinkability
an
extremely
wellcrafted
german
seasonal
my
favorite
overall
domestic
oktoberfest
d
extremely
drinkable
its
surprising
that
this
one
is
even
6
5
alcohol
sweet
tastes
are
never
overwhelming
and
couple
perfectly
with
ohios
autumn
weather
and
probably
germanys
too
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
khakicolored
head
with
some
rusty
highlights
the
retention
was
soso
the
lacing
quite
thin
to
my
surprise
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
malt
and
some
lights
spices
including
hints
of
vanilla
the
flavors
were
a
combination
of
toasted
malt
dry
grains
some
chewy
breadlike
malts
and
a
bit
of
biscuits
the
hops
did
follow
through
in
the
end
but
had
trouble
keeping
up
with
the
array
of
malts
still
given
that
this
is
a
maltheavy
style
of
beer
i
had
to
admire
the
emphasis
and
depth
of
the
malts
on
display
the
mouthfeel
was

being

drinkability
was
good
it
was
a
flavorful
but
easy
drinking
beer
it
was
a
good
version
of
the
style
as
well
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
d
robust
but
not
overly
so
this
has
great
heft
and
depth
while
being
amazingly
rounded
and
balanced
a
bit
hop
forward
for
the
style
but
richly
malty
too
maybe
done
a
bit
for
a
us
palate
but
this
is
close
enough
to
style
goes
down
easy
and
is
sure
to
get
the
party
started
a
quite
attractive
entry
into
the
ofest
category
from
great
lakes
light
orange
amber
in
color
fairly
clear
look
with
a
moderately
dense
wellcomposed
head
laces
with
authority
bit
of
a
light
cheesy
quality
to
the
extensively
toasted
grain
aroma
not
overly
malty
and
certainly
no
significant
hop
notes
to
smell
either
though
some
fruitiness
shows
through
in
the
scent
as
well
the
munich
malt
does
shape
the
profile
of
the
flavor
which
as
i
mentioned
before
isnt
heavily
malty
but
does
display
some
biscuit
spice
wafer
qualities
that
mysterious
grassy
cheesiness
and
finishes
with
an
apple
sweetness
and
tiny
medicinal
burst
in
the
very
end
carbonation
is
aboveaverage
thinning
its
medium
body
a
bit
a
thinsyrupy
malty
tang
lingers
in
the
back
and
sides
of
the

pretty
good

lingers
maltiness
in
aroma
oddly
enough
pick
up
a
heavy
vegetably
peppery
smell
some
breadiness
from
malt
and
some
very
sight
orange
on
inhale
of
beer
in
throat
pick
up
a
big
hint
of
jello
maybe
cherry
same
thing
on
actual
flavor
some
breadiness
some
lagery
sweetness
but
still
predominantly
jello
coud
be
something
in
the
growler
perhaps
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
octoberfest
one
of
the
best
us
oktoberfests
next
year
a
sixer
instead
of
just
a
single
a
very
clear
quiet
looking
beer
with
a
light
copper
color
and
a
minor
white
cover
the
lacing
is
pretty
mediocre
the
aroma
is
a
sort
of
swampyskunk
bread
with
earthy
peanut
malt
a
bit
odd
to
say
the
least
perhaps
a
little
scary
fortunately
it
translates
into
a
perfectly
fine
oktoberfest
burst
of
malty
flavor
over
the
malt
i
get
leafy
hop
and
a
hint
of
bready
toffee
that
provides
a
classic
german
idea
that
is
medium
bodied
crisp
and
easy
drinking
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
a
great
session
choice
for
the
autumnal
months
d
very
good
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
not
the
best
fall
brew
i
have
ever
had
but
decent
good
session
beer
if
you
have
access
otherwise
dont
bother
dvery
high
sorry
i
only
have
a
six
of
this
have
to
get
more
next
fall
i
like
sweet
marzens
while
this
beer
isnt
strongly
sweet
the
heavy
body
and
low
bitterness
allow
the
malt
and
touch
of
hops
to
follow
through
nicely
i
know
the
bros
gave
this
an
a
but
i
know
what
my
palate
likes
and
ive
for
sure
had
better
oktoberfests
this
one
was
just
a
little
weak
to
me
d
easy
drinking
its
malty
but
the
balance
is
so
good
that
it
goes
down
fast
and
easy
good
except
for
the
high
abv
d
what
is
this
honey
i
dunno
how
much
i
like
this
as
an
oktoberfest
but
as
a
honey
beer
its
great
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
would
get
me
in
trouble
if
i
had
more
of
them
id
drink
the
everloving
shit
out
of
em
pours
a
brilliant
orange
with
tan
onefinger
head
clear
as
day
nose
is
perfection
as
usual
with

a
balanced
essence
of
dark
fruity
hops
malt
and
yeast
taste
begins
with
carbonation
slightly
hiding
malt
sweetness
hops
bitterness
is
perfectly
balanced
dryish
finish
with
bready

highly
quaffable

with
moderate
sweetness
some
bready
notes
within
a
caramel

maincurrent
judicious
use
of
hops
provides
balance
toward
the
end
i
can
see
an
oompah
band
and
liters
of
this
going
together
quite
nicely
bring
on
the
bratwurst
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
would
love
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
if
i
see
it
taste
delicate
spice
maybe
even
pumpkin
in
the
most
minute
degree
you
start
to
think
even
though
youre
fairly
certain
it
really
isnt
there
sweetness
seemed
to
be
more
than
desireable
this
one
was
not
exactly
pie
but
made
me
think
of
pie
seems
almost
like
an
imperial
version
of
an
octoberfest
or
all
the
others
ive
had
were
just
weak
versions
i
dunno
dont
drink
enough
of
the
style
to
really
give
a
super
informed
opinion
i
like
most
of
the
great
lakes
beers
this
one
was
no
different
a
terrific
example
of
the
style
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
beers
of
fall
and
great
lakes
definately
delivers
the
goods
very
nice
interpretation
the
drinkability
is
excellent
i
put
5
away
during
a
party
a
few
weeks
back
before
saving
this
one
to
review
properly
a
very
easy
drinking
but
tasty
marzen
d
a
solid
oktoberfest
from
a
solid
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
brew
is
thick
flavorful
unlike
any
octoberfest
i
have
had
very
sessionable
and
has
a
nice
alcohol
kick
very
good
stuff
the
best
stand
out
octoberfest
i
have
tried
i
hope
that
i
can
find
this
one
on
tap
somewhere
this
fall
drinkability
ive
never
been
to
one
as
far
as
the
real
thing
goes
but
this
is
probably
my
favorite
domestic
version
i
need
to
stock
up
on
this
try
it
if
you
can
drinkability
ok
very
nice
example
of
octoberfest
beer

has

of

a
hint
of
hops
that
and
definitely
bready
aftertaste
that
lingers
body
of
the
beer
is
not
as
heavy
as
expected
all
in
all
a
drinkable
oktoberfest
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
season
d
well
i
loved
it
it
came
off
big
bold
yet
sweet
and
medium
bodied
liked
it
great
brew
great

one
of
the
better
ofests
that
ive
had
thus
far
this
year
delicious
and
recommended
overall
i
think
this
is
a
welldone
octoberfest
i
prefer
a
little
sweeter
interpretation
but
can
appreciate
the
authenticity
and
refinement
of
this
effort
do
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
per
the
beer
style
overall
im
a
tad
disappointed
with
this
great
lakes
brew
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
for
sure
midwest
represent
am
going
to
blame
the
style
as
it
is
a
fairly
narrow
one
with
how
it
can
stand
out
above
the
others
it
seems
anyways
most
importantly
for
me
this
beer
has
no
metallic
taste
traits
that
some
other
marzens
seem
to
have
for
me
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
for
the
fall
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
big
dense
beer
quite
pleasant
beautiful
on
a
fall
evening
drinkable
duh
oktoberfest
its
built
to
binge
this
can
be
consumed
in
bulk
not
a
sipper
or
overly
sweet
at
all
and
perfectly
suited
for
a
1

from
plantation
total
wine
i
like
this
in
comparison
to
the
mainstream
oktoberfests
that
flood
stores
this
time
of
year
still
theres
an
odd
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
keeps
me
from
rating
it
any
higher
a
touch
too
much
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
overall
2
97
im
maxed
out
on
beers
tonight
i
came
home
from
a
concert
where
i
had
three
pints
of
beer
had
an
imperial
stout
a
honey
lager
and
now
this
im
doing
this
because
i
love
you
guys
no
wait
im
doing
this
to
see
if
i
want
to
go
back
and
pay
1
25
again
for
this
single
that
my
liquor
joint
carries
a
lot
of
that
being
said
as
a
lager
it
drinks
good
as
an
oktoberfest
its
crap
sorry
pourrrrrr
waaaay
to
sweet
dont
let
this
warm
up
if
you
dont
want
to
drink
maple
syrup
loved
the
brewery
tour
but
the
beer
was
ok
after
tasting
octoberfest
i
want
to
give
another
try
nice
head
on
the
pour
which
is
a
great
trait
for
classic
octofest
tasting
cloves
a
little
hop
carmel
biscuit
as
well
actually
quite
balanced
with
a
little
alcohol
kick
at
back
of
throat
very
nice
experience
during
current
octofest
sampling
tour
im
currently
on
o
this
is
one
of
wi
better
oktoberfest
beirs
im
going
to
make
sure
my
dad
picks
up
a
case
of
it
this
is
a
solidinterpretation
of
a
smooth
easytodrink
ofest
with
a
nice
malty
texture
pours
a
hazy
brownamber
in
color
with
a
good
2
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
layering
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
perfect
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
the
aroma
is
of
bread
yeast
malts
and
spice
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
toffee
honey
and
orange
peel
as
well
very
tasty
and
goes
down
very
easy
compared
to
others
i
had
of
this
type
pretty
good
beer
but
tastes
different
that
other
oktoberfests
ive
had
oktoberfest
brews
are
some
of
my
favorite
beer
that
being
said
the
taste
was
kind
of
lacking
on
this
beer
tastes
more
like
regular
beer
than
most
oktoberfests
not
as
sweet
as
most
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
definitely
better
oktoberfest
brewers
out
there
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
it
needs
more
of
the
oktoberfest
taste
instead
it
tastes
like
someone
poured
regular
beer
into
the
oktoberfest
overall
a
good
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
but
nothing
memorable
while
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
also
happily
drink
it
again
there
are
a
good
number
of
american
oktoberfest
beers
that
id
order
or
purchase
again
over
this
one
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
malty
and
is
true
to
the
style
but
the
maltiness
is
of
a
lighter
variety
and
isnt
that
heavy
on
the
palate
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
o
here
we
have
lakefronts
oktoberfest
a
pretty
clean
lager
that
goes
down
well
while
offering
bready
malt
overtones
and
a
dry
earthy
hop
finish
for
an
easy
fall
drinker
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
have
been
better
malty
with
a
very
nice
head
and
lacing
i
like
this
beer
and
will
drink
more
of
it
in
the
future
like
all
oktoberfest
beers
is
low
in
alcohol
but
definitely
not
a
lawnmower
beer
nice
caramel
aftertaste
i
can
not
detect
any
hops
although
they
are
present
and
remember
folks
support
your
local
brewery
drink
beer
hog
lakefront
oktoberfest
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
cap
the
aroma
is
a
nice
rich
caramel
malt
with
some
sweet
grains
the
malts
become
more
rich
and
sweet
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
fairly
strong
grain
flavor
ive
noticed
in
other
lakefront
lagers
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
expected
with
a
carbonation
level
that
would
be
on
point
with
a
lighter
body
overall
lakefronts
oktoberfest
is
another
decent
stab
at
the
style
this
was
just
a
bit
too
strong
but
was
better
than
the
lighter
bodied
and
hued
octoberfests
that
ive
had
in
recent
years
it
wont
blow
anyone
one
away
but
for
a
fall
seasonal
this
would
be
a
great
choice
that
can
be
appreciated
by
nearly
all
mild
notes
of
caramel
and
nuts
complimented
by
the
bready
nature
although
you
wouldnt
know
it
from
looking
at
it
hops
virtually
undiscernable
which
is
to
say
it
is
made
to
style
toffee
as
well
is
minimal
this
is
a
somewhat
crowd
pleaser
not
very
thick
easy
enough
to
drink
nothing
special
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
mug
hazy
amber
with
a
modestly
sized
head
decent
retention
though
and
a
bit
of
lace
smells
pretty
tame
toasty
and
bready
grains
some
floral
hops
but
tastes
more
interesting
than
advertised
grainy
and
almost
gritty
at
times
with
a
robust
feel
in
spite
of
the
rather
modest
caramel
sweetness
dryish
finish
that
shows
off
grassy
and
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
tanginess
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
one
out
again
but
it
grew
on
me
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
smells
pretty
decent
but
the
flavor
isnt
all
that
good
overall
i
like
the
addition
of
the
sweet
fruit
notes
that
alter
from
a
normal
marzen
well
done
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
little
more
complexity
then
the
usual
oktoberfest
bought
a
few
bottles
in
2012
initially
it
tasted
overly
sweet
and
strong
notes
of
citrus
peels
from
the
hops
the
color
is
excellent
for
this
style
though
and
the
aroma
is
spot
on
woody
burnt
sugar
malty
and
inviting
last
week
i
found
a
bottle
i
had
buried
in
my
stash
for
2
years
in
the
cool
basement
at
6568
degrees
and
cooled
it
down
for
a
couple
days
i
opened
today
to
see
what
it
had
become
and
was
pleased
to
find
the
citrusy
hops
had
disappeared
while
the
caramel
rich
malt
flavor
increased
drank
almost
like
a
dunkelweizen
very
smooth
malty
and
caramel
rich
with
a
slightly
crisp
finish
overall
i
just
think
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
holds
up
to
the
style
its
not
aggressive
in
any
area
it
just
tastes
like
a
damn
marzen
and
thats
awesome
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
light
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
loaded
with
malty
sweetness
some
earthy
notes
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
very
light
spice
notes
with
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
marzen
isnt
bad
i
thought
it
was
enjoyable
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
o
a
middle
of
the
road
oktoberfest
not
the
best
flavour
drinkable
enough
but
theres
a
lot
better
out
there
overall
this
one
is
drinkable
but
lacking
in
the
degree
of
spiciness
hopiness
and
malt
profile
you
want
from
the
style
this
beer
proclaims
to
be
an
oktoberfest
lager
however
the
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
sorely
lacking
the
color
is
a
dark
gold
or
brown
the
beer
smells
average
maybe
a
bit
sweet
the
taste
however
is
where
this
beer
suffers
at
best
i
picked
up
on
a
partial
oktoberfest
taste
the
mouthfeel
just
wasnt
pleasant
overall
this
is
one
best
let
on
the
shelf
o
a
nice
and
flavorful
if
rather
sweet
oktoberfest
drinkability
it
lacks
the
robustness
i
want
but
i
suppose
it
is
heading
in
the
right
direction
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
though
it
lacks
a
little
flavor
and
smells
a
little
too
candy
and
childlike
and
the
fact
that
this
only
has
a
b
on
ba
just
shows
more
of
how
much
the
american
palate
is
out
of
touch
they
love
to
rate
oktoberfest
style
beers
with
tons
of
caramel
and
sweet
toasty
malts
and
tons
of
spicy
hops
with
a
big
rating
and
something
like
this
with
a
low
rating
the
american
palate
is
so
out
of
whack
these
days
nothing
where
it
should
be
and
this
is
a
great
example
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
oktoberfest
beers
ive
ever
had
well
done
lakefront
o
really
nice
marzen
here
ive
tried
a
quite
a
few
different
ofests
this
fall
and
this
could
sneak
right
into
my
top
five
would
gladly
recommend
poured
medium
orangish
brown
with
medium
carbonation
and
light
medium
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smell
had
that
pleasant
octoberfest
spices
i
like
tast
was
just
ok
had
some
toffee
and
spices
but
very
average
not
complex
and
thin
mouthfeel
average
offering
decent
session
beer
o
strictly
average
here
at
best
not
awful
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
are
better
choices
out
there
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
wasnt
necessarily
perplexing
in
its
taste
but
it
was
definitely
unique
enough
to
peak
my
interest
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
smells
or
looks
not
that
this
a
is
a
bad
looking
beer
with
an
odd
odor
pretty
dry
even
though
there
is
some
caramel
or
sugary
malt
in
the
middle
i
could
see
going
back
to
this
one
every
year
overall
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
take
and
i
would
not
really
reccomend
it
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
one
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
better
yet
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
a
few
maybe
tonight
minimal
hop
flavor
decent
body
its
just
not
that
enjoyable
something
just
tastes
off
i
dont
remember
being
a
fan
of
the
beers
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
reinforces
that
impression
pours
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
muted
smells
of
tea
earthy
some
bread
tastes
of
caramel
some
biscuits
more
tea
some
medium
umami
notes
on
the
finish
low
carbonation
a
nice
beer
a
good
oktoberfest
my
first
from
this
brewery
i
will
try
more
pours
amber
with
minimal
head
even
with
vigorous
pour
nose
is
also
a
bit
weak
with
earthy
malt
and
some
yeasty
bread
dough
fresh
bready
flavors
on
the
palate
toasty
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
light
herbal
hops
good
body
easy
drinking
but
heavier
than
other
examples
out
there
o
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
o
this
likely
wont
be
the
highest
rate
of
the
marzens
ive
had
this
season
but
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
tasty
in
in
its
own
right
id
probably
not
buy
an
entire
six
pack
of
this
but
would
gladly
add
it
to
a
mixed
six
pack
again
o
big
malty
beer
for
sure
smooth
with
a
fairly
good
balance
as
americanbrewed
marzens
go
its
pretty
damn
good
its
flavorful
with
a
decent
maltiness
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
its
really
wellbalanced
and
quite
drinkable
prost
on
tap
and
so
fresh
from
the
brewery
very
good
drinkability
with
a
sour
edge
lemony
thick
lacey
with
only
a
slight
coloured
body
approprately
carbonated
and
hopped
cascade
i
am
told
by
the
president
one
of
their
more
enjoyable
choices
brewery
does
better
on
traditional
styles
a
good
tasting
beer
but
needs
some
work
in
attenuation
the
color
and
clarity
are
perfect
it
has
great
aromatic
properties
nice
finishing
hops
the
aftertaste
is
nice
this
could
be
one
to
change
my
mind
about
the
style
i
actually
would
try
it
again
i
am
planing
a
trip
to
the
milwaukee
area
next
month
so
maybe
i
can
get
some
on
tap
overall
a
mild
and
easytodrink
session
beer
lacking
in
complexity
but
making
up
for
it
in
drinkability
not
outstanding
but
solid
o
marzens
arent
my
favorite
beers
but
i
do
enjoy
them
and
try
to
keep
reviews
to
style
that
said
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
lager
notbad
oktoberfest
beer
unfortunately
does
not
differentiate
itself
well
enough
for
a
revisit
given
the
glut
of
similar
offerings
this
time
of
year
poured
a
cloudy
orangish
copper
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
head
on
it
not
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
taste
was
not
very
bitter
tasted
some
malt
and
spice
a
very
mild
oktoberfest
beer
that
being
said
it
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
these
its
a
good
beer
just
not
a
real
pronounced
flavor
pours
a
copper
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
nose
is
sweet
toasted
malt
some

nice

some
bitter

to
add
some
balance
overall
a
good
drinkable
brew
medium
body
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
one
a
little
better
than
the
sam
adams
octoberfest
and
it
was
on
par
with
the
victory
festbier
taste
is
not
good
from
the
start
a
bit
of
diacetyl
presence
permeates
the
entire
brew
light
caramel
and
toffee
make
their
way
through
but
this
is
almost
entirely
buttered
popcorn
fairlystrong
off
flavors
here
body
is
light
to
medium
with
pretty
low
carbonation
all
together
i
cannot
get
past
the
flaws
in
this
one
and
the
fact
that
there
wasnt
much
there
to
begin
with
d
a
decidedly
average
take
on
the
oktoberfest
style
pours
a
very
nice
copper
honey
prong
color
that
has
a
slight
cloudiness
to
it
nice
presentation
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
off
with
a
homebrewed
lager
aroma
that
smells
of
unfermented
sugars
and
some
mild
spices
taste
is
average
to
me
solid
brew
just
isnt
really
authentic
citrus
finish
which
is
interesting
but
i
really
dont
want
it
in
my
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
transparent
dark
orange
with
a
small
white
head
capping
it
off
littletono
lace
left
behind
basic
nose
some
caramel
bread
and
faint
ethanol
the
body
was
firm
a
little
slick
at
times
but
decent
carbonation
overall
good
toffee
sweetness
right
away
but
theres
a
slightly
annoying
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
clouds
all
other
aspects
of
aftertaste
fairly
bready
beer
which
i
like
but
that
ethanol
characteristic
is
a
little
turnoff
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
but
not
one
of
my
faves
d
this
is
an
okay
oktoberfest
they
certainly
are
better
out
there
though
cheers

nicely

this
is
horrible
please
god
save
us
ive
had
beers
from
lakefront
that
were
not
this
bad
this
is
nearly
unexcusable
with
the
diacetyl
true
to
the
marzen
style
and
imminently
drinkable
brewed
to
celebrate
a
successful
harvest
or
the
end
of
a
hectic
work
week
prost
hazy
reddish
copper
brew
gives
a
half
inch
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
almost
nothing
good
malty
marzen
nose
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
green
apple
taste
has
a
thin
sugary
sweetness
that
detracts
from
the
malt
body
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
for
the
style
not
as
toasty
or
malty
as
id
prefer
drinkability
there
is
nothing
in
this
beer
that
could
slow
me
down
so
its
pretty
drinkable
this
seasonal
from
lakefront
is
at
least
in
2010
a
very
average
presentation
of
this
style
after
allowing
it
to
reach
a
drinking
temperature
i
found
the
maltiness
to
be
weak
and
lacking
in
flavor
the
body
was
also
pretty
watery
color
was
okay
but
not
robust
on
a
brisk
october
day
this
would
not
add
any
warmth
to
the
soul
it
is
solid
if
middle
of
the
road
for
the
oktoberfest
category
d
very
nice
a
midcross
between
a
bavarian
and
american
okto
but
fills
the
bill
for
those
looking
for
that
autumn
character
orange
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
of
foam
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
mere
film
there
is
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
other
than
a
faint
graininess
the
flavors
are
nice
and
typical
for
the
style
caramel
sweetness
and
raw
grain
with
some
light
savory
spice
notes
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
a
little
under
malted
for
my
personal
tastes
an
average
domestic
ofest
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
light
malty
nose
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
a
malty
bready
similar
to
their
pumpkin
lager
without
the
pumpkin
bottled
sep
2009
2
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
marzen
but
it
could
certainly
be
a
lot
cleaner
picked
up
a
single
at
princeton
liquors
the
label
says
it
was
bottled
the
2nd
week
of
september
so
its
only
about
six
weeks
old
the
lager
appeared
a
clear
orange
with
a
tall
white
head
oddly
enough
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
more
like
a
maibock
theres
a
definite
clove
and
dried
fruit
quality
that
presents
before
the
normal
caramel
and
bready
malts
kick
in
a
tasty
beer
but
not
on
point
for
the
style
dvery
drinkable
even
if
this
isnt
a
perfect
beer
man
is
it
a
good
fest
beer
pretty
good
beer
very
red
appearance
a
decent
smell
but
nothing
particularly
great
good
taste
nothing
to
throw
you
off
but
nothing
to
particularly
bring
you
in
either
some
substance
for
the
mouthfeel
and
decently
drinkable
certainly
i
wouldnt
advise
anyone
to
not
try
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
lakefront
as
this
is
my
first
as
far
as
i
know
pours
a
bright
amber
body
with
a
white
head
of
foam
that
falls
after
a
couple
minutes
aroma
is
slightly
toasted
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
cake
spice
medium
to
full
bodied
mouth
feel
with
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
last
all
the
way
through
the
finish
without
being
overly
sweet
overall
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
its
getting
to
that
time
of
year
again
college
football
cold
crisp
air
pumpkin
pie
and
oktoberfest
beers
ive
never
had
lakefronts
take
on
the
style
so
here
it
goes
poured
into
my
lakefront
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
amber
hue
slightly
tinted
towards
the
orange
side
of
the
color
scale
the
head
is
about
a
half
inch
high
and
a
brownish
orange
color
after
settling
the
head
leaves
a
kiss
of
lace
around
my
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
yeasty
some
hops
but
mostly
malt
the
flavor
is
bready
and
sweet
very
malty
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
can
be
picked
up
on
the
back
end
very
dry
finish
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
robust
flavor
from
this
one
overall
a
very
solid
little
beer
here
i
was
not
expecting
the
world
here
but
was
more
then
pleased
with
the
results
very
solid
offering
d
right
up
there
for
drinkability
as
all
beers
of
this
style
are
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
and
if
i
were
in
the
proper
mood
i
would
easily
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
i
hope
i
can
find
this
again
because
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
taste
is
nice
also
fruity
and
lemony
with
light
cracker
quality
apple
peel
and
light
yeastiness
its
zesty
with
a
light
bitterness
balancing
and
perhaps
just
edging
out
the
light
sweetness
however
itss
somewhat
thin
and
light
but
still
more
flavourful
and
interesting
than
the
gordon
biersch
marzen
pours
a
clear
dark
ambercopper
color
with
2
fingers
of
eggshelllight
tan
head
good
retention
and
ok
lacing
smells
of
citrus
fruits
caramel
floral
hops
and
grainy
bread
tastes
of
fruits
like
lemon
and
orange
up
front
then
some
honey
and
grain
and
a
nice
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
finishes
with
some
light
floral
and
earthy
hops
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
thin
in
places
but
for
the
most
part
pretty
chewy
with
a
touch
of
bitter
easy
to
drink
seems
pretty
sessionable
not
a
bad
brew
by
lakefront
deep
copper
with
hints
of
ruby
shines
through
grabbing
the
eye
immediately
not
much
of
a
head
but
decent
bubbling
crisp
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
give
the
scent
of
fresh
baked
bread
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
toasted
malts
wth
some
mint
julep
hops
sweetnot
cloying
or
overdone
great
drinkability
very
good
amercan
version
of
a
classic
german
style
the
mouth
is
slightly
thinner
than
i
like
in
this
style
but
it
is
an
easy
drinker
that
goes
well
with
hearty
food
drinkability
a
slightly
sweet
oktoberfest
that
is
quite
enjoyable
easy
to
quaff
this
one
as
several
can
be
had
in
a
session
i
could
and
have
drank
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
great
beer
not
a
great
oktoberfest
but
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
enjoyed
it
overall
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
with
the
off
flavors
that
were
so
evident
i
believe
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
if
not
then
id
have
to
say
this
is
probably
the
most
disappointing
oktoberfestbier
ive
sampled
this
season
pours
a
slightly
clouded
orange
hued
brown
basically
no
head
flavor
is
sweetish
slight
leafy
acorn
thing
is
there
as
well
feel
is
sticky
slick
on
the
liquid
and
carbonation
is
about
standard
i
suppose
nice
to
drink
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
its
good
enough
overall
one
of
the
weakest
oktoberfests
i
have
tried
thus
far
this
year
not
very
drinkable
i
mostly
have
an
urge
to
chug
it
due
to
the
weird
aftertaste
will
not
be
getting
it
again
when
there
are
so
many
better
ones
drinkability
its
a
little
different
from
some
oktoberfest
beers
but
its
good
then
again
ill
drink
almost
any
oktoberfest
and
like
it
one
of
the
few
things
that
makes
the
end
of
summer
bearable
comes
from
a
fine
brewery
in
a
town
made
famous
by
beer
overall
good
but
a
little
to
tangy
to
drink
more
than
1
pint
i
would
pass
on
this
the
next
time
an
underdeveloped
lager
the
abv
feels
a
little
high
as
well
overall
i
find
this
very
drinkable
i
wish
that
it
poured
with
a
better
head
but
that
will
not
stop
me
from
putting
down
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
well
done
lakefront
its
okay
not
an
oktoberfest
beer
more
of
a
its
70
degrees
outside
and
i
just
want
something
to
drink
beer
i
should
have
bought
a
case
for
15
it
would
have
been
great
party
fodder

a

oktoberfest
at
all
overall
a
nice
tasting
ofest
a

sweeter
than
expected
for
a
lager
under

but
a
decent
brew
overall
pours
a
golden
amber
color
slight
layer
of
foam
but
not
much
it
smells
malty
and
quite
basic
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
but
not
quite
as
basic
as
the
aroma
is
a
little
more
flavor
in
here
than
i
thought
there
would
be
one
of
the
more
flavorful
marzens
but
still
very
true
to
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
closing
in
on
becoming
mediumbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
good
also
nice
adequate
carbonation
solid
fulldrinking
nice
output
by
lakefront
not
a
boring
wimpy
beer
but
nothing
extravagant
either
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
concentrated
marzen
but
not
overbearing
lacks
a
bit
in
the
boldness
and
could
use
some
spice
since
it
is
a
marzen
d
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
go
back
for
this
one
shadow
of
that
hop
really
tasty
and
appetizing
i
bought
this
bottle
in
ct
poured
the
brew
at
cellar
temp
into
an
english
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
beige
head
that
fades
rapidly
to
a
thin
edge
layer
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
in
the
background
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
malt
from
start
to
finish
with
caramel
and
toffee
and
brown
sugar
mixing
nicely
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
and
spot
on
for
an
octoberfest
brew
imo
check
it
out
next
fall
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
pinkishred
hue
and
a
head
composed
of
a
thin
layer
of
very
fine
bubbles
primarily
smell
is
sweetness
from
the
amber
malts
very
little
hop
presence
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
but
there
is
more
bittering
hops
which
balance
out
the
sweetness
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
and
has
a
dry

this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
marzen
i
would
say
slightly
better
than
your
average
id
drink
it
again
drink
ability
this
was
ok
didnt
really
do
anything
for
me
glad
that
im
working
my
way
through
a
sampler
and
not
a
six
pack
i
have
never
been
thrilled
with
lakefront
beer
and
oktoberfest
lager
has
done
nothing
to
change
my
mind
i
can
see
how
oktoberfestophiles
might
like
it
but
even
they
would
have
to
admit
that
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
best
versions
even
the
best
domestic
versions
d
started
out
with
some
funny
sour
notes
but
finished
up
ok
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
thats
not
really
and
oktoberfests
trademark
lots
of
thanks
to
jpm30
prosit
mk
i
should
have
refrained
from
pouring
this
into
a
hofbräu
mug
seeing
as
their
okt
which
is
selfaggrandized
to
be
the
worlds
greatest
was
my
least
favorite
besides
the
one
by
summit
the
lakefront
one
however
ranks
behind
the
harpoon
and
samuel
adams
only
by
a
small
margin
that
is
only
due
to
the
lesser
amounts
of
sweetness
and
not
because
of
the
quality
which
is
on
par
with
the
afforementioned
other
than
the
fuel
cafe
this
is
their
most
drinkable
in
multiple
quantities
beer
wear

not
particularly
alluring
lakefronts
version
of
an
oktoberfest
pours
into
the
pint
glass
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
shortly
after
pouring
the
beer
has
a
moderate
malty
aroma
with
a
toasty
element
present
likely
a
healthy
amount
of
munich
malt
there
is
no
detectable
hop
aroma
this
oktoberfest
has
a
high
malty
flavor
a
background
of
toasty
munich
and
a
rather
sweet
element
as
well
likely
a
fair
amount
of
crystal
malt
as
expected
with
the
style
no
detectable
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
is
rather
low
perhaps
a
bit
too
low
making
this
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
i
would
guess
close
to
15
ibus
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
is
medium
although
the
crystal
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
high
for
my
palate
and
might
limit
how
many
of
these
oktoberfests
i
would
want
to
indulge
in
overall
this
a
solid
oktoberfest
then
again
almost
any
oktoberfest
is
good
since
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
enjoy
the
maltiness
and
toastiness
of
the
beer
but
the
beer
is
a
tad
on
the
sweet
end
and
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
wouldnt
have
been
bad
to
find
still
with
that
said
a
good
oktoberfest
drinks
okay
this
doesnt
really
cut
it
as
a
marzen
but
there
are
worse
examples
out
there
thisd
probably
rate
5
higher
as
an
ameican
lager
imo
drinkability
high
but
filling
not
too
much
head
hazy
rust
body
slight
vinegar
in
the
nose
also
some
graininess
very
acidic
flavor
also
toasted
grains
making
up
the
bulk
of
the
flaovr
hops
are
not
very
dominant
decent
carbonation
and
body
mediocre
oktoberfest
i
probably
wouldnt
come
back
to
it
a
pretty
clear
reddishgold
color
pretty
good
lacing
smells
has
the
same
funky
yeast
character
as
a
lot
of
lakefronts
other
beers
smell
and
taste
are
otherwise
primarily
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
toastedness
and
a
slightly
bitter
earthy
finish
maybe
a
little
apple
pretty
boring
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
and
there
was
very
little
carbonation
maybe
a
halffinger
of
head
that
raced
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
body
is
light
yet
its
heavy
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
yet
its
crisp
and
dry
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
coffee
so
very
hard
to
explain
but
so
fun
to
drink
it
left
my
mouth
wanting
more
this
is
the
worst
lakefront
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
same
batch
as
the
one
big
hugey
rated
and
i
almost
have
to
wonder
if
it
is
bad
even
though
it
appears
pretty
fresh
sour
nose
like
it
is
spoiled
taste
is
sour
and
tart
if
i
really
really
strain
i
get
some
toasted
grains
in
the
long
finish
but
this
is
really
bad
i
can
only
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
i
would
never
ever
buy
this
again
if
this
is
what
they
brewed
it
to
taste
like
pretty
brutal
and
lakefront
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
clear
tawnyamber
in
hue
with
slight
influences
of
copper
and
gold
the
color
is
attractive
however
there
wasnt
any
animation
the
head
was
slightly
offwhite
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
one
finger
in
height
it
faded
quickly
to
a
fizzy
cap
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
clung
poorly
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
clean
grainy
mildly
fruity
kind
of
nutty
at
the
back
it
doesnt
really
say
ofest
to
me
the
potency
is
very
low
i
guess
it
is
inviting
by
default
the
palate
is
good
but
nothing
more
than
that
it
is
has
more
malt
than
the
nose
indicated
this
is
a
good
thing
the
sweetness
is
mild
the
nuttiness
is
soft
but
still
misplaced
for
an
ofest
mild
caramel
influences
mixed
with
a
good
dose
of
straight
maltiness
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
style
enjoyable
fairly
clean
after
the
swallow
a
somewhat
chocolaty
bittersweet
taste
emerges
hops
offer
only
a
trace
of
grassiness
overall
the
taste
is
pleasant
aside
from
a
mineraly
twang
the
flavors
are
straightforward
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
that
helps
produce
a
sluggish
mouthfeel
even
though
there
isnt
much
bulk
this
aspect
of
the
beer
could
be
improved
i
found
it
too
lazy
on
the
tongue
it
is
drinkable
but
ordinary
only
a
dime
a
dozen
type
ofest
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
and
then
id
have
to
upgrade
to
a
more
flavorful
beer
it
has
some
positive
aspects
and
some
negatives
for
instance
i
dont
like
the
odd
mineral
twang
at
all
this
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
milwaukee
wi
i
wont
need
to
try
this
one
again
too
boring
last
day
of
october
to
enjoy
the
oktober
pours

reddish
brown

colored

that
leaves
all
to
fast
shame
very
slow
carbonation

visible
smells
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
malty
hmmm
taste
the
very
same
smooth
and
creamy
and
mouth
filling
geez
this
is
good
a
brief
hoppy
start
that
rolls
into
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
gonna
have
to
find
more
dont
have
time
to
write
more
there
is
still
the
remainder
of
this
glass
and
bottle
pours
a
super
clear
light
brown
color
with
a
very
small
head
the
scent
is
of
toasted
malts
and
incredibly
buttery
ive
always
read
about
diacetyl
and
butterybutterscotch
flavors
but
never
been
able
to
ditect
them
until
this
beer
the
taste
continues
the
buttery
malt
flavors
and
ends
with
a
strong
hoppy
earthy
aftertaste
at
first
i
thought
the
buttery
flavors
were
kind
of
night
but
after
a
few
sips
they
became
sickeningly
unpleasant
glad
i
had
only
a
small
glass
of
this
beer
picked
this
up
this
week
and
was
looking
forward
to
this
batch
beer
poured
a
copperish
brown
with
little
or
no
retainable
head
could
smell
the
malts
in
this
brew
and
thought
it
would
be
great
unfortunately
this
beer
did
not
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
while
the
malt
was
there
it
tasted
watered
down
a
dissapointment

this
brewery

hopefully
i
can

i

sure
they
can
do
better
than
this
poured
a
clear

with
an
offwhite
large
creamy

aroma
had
a
similar
quality
to
the
riverwest
stein
but
reeked
of
wet
cardboard
this
is
basically
and
amber
lager
lacking
the
rich
malt
flavors
typical
in
an
oktoberfestmarzen
style
beer
very
light
bodied
overall
bland
taste
did
not
improve
as
the
beer
warmed
either
finish
is
a
bad
combination
of
sourness
and
decaying
fruit
its
hard
to
find
anything
positive
to
say
about
this
one
except
the
appearance
is
quite
alluring
this
must
be
a
lakefront
workinprogress
that
needs
more
refining

reddish

with
moderate

and
appropriate

both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
off
for
an
oktoberfest
both
vinegar
sweet
apple
notes
dominate
rather
than
the
caramel
or
biscuity
aroma
and
that
should
be
present
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
from
a
brewery
that
usually
produces
excellent
beers
pours

these
are
offflavors
to
me
and
they
surprise
me
a
bit
coming
from
a
high
quality
brewery
such
as
lakefront
the
sour
apple
taste
is
an
indication
sometimes
that
a
beer
is
green
and
i
think
they
have
got
a
real
winner
on
their
hands
classic

one
of
the
best
octoberfests
ive
had
best

bier
in

hands
down
i
love
all
things
authentic
so
knowing
this
is
a
quite
authentic
oktoberfest
beer
earns
some
automatic
points
for
me
i
have
come
to
really
love
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
as
well
it
would
be
nice
it
the
aroma
was
a
little
stronger
but
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
tried
overall
ill
pass
on
it
next
time
its
not
bad

whatever
its
okay

overall
a
very
good
oktoberfest
brew
o
pretty
good
brew
very
well
balanced
with
nice
notes

and
the
spice
comes
through
all
over
on
this
brew
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
prost
pretty
good
definite
traditional
octofest
a
little
thin
on
body
but
hard
to
beat
how
everything
comes
together
very
smooth
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
end
along
with
german
twang
gets
better
as
i
work
down
the
das
boot
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
shortlasting
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
is
mild
bready
and
lightly
sweet
the
taste
is
equally
mild
and
similar
in
profile
with
a
little
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
heading
towards
watery
but
not
quite
there
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
throughout
not
my
favorite
german
marzen
my
first
ever
5
a
much
lighter
and
much
sweeter
version
of
the
marzen
style
than
i
am
used
to
a
little
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
for
the
style
as
well
overall
a
decent
beer
but
so
far
my
leastfavourite
oktoberfest
yet
delicious
o
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
afternoonevening
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
example
of
a
traditional
oktoberfest
beer
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
everything
seemed
to
be
pretty
inline
with
the
style
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
any
more
than
that
and
the
apple
cider
aspect
might
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
good
and
it
was
just
what
i
expect
from
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
apple
cider
aspect
in
the
taste
and
aroma
i
think
i
would
like
this
beer
a
little
more
if
it
didnt
have
that
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
traditional
oktoberfest
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
keep
my
fridge
stocked
up
and
i
would
say
its
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
it
was
just
slightly
rough
around
the
edges
and
i
think
if
it
was
cleaned
up
just
it
little
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
this
wasnt
my
favorite
oktoberfest
but
its
not
a
bad
one
and
this
beer
made
a
decent
first
impression
of
this
brewery
and
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
of
there
beer
solid
job
guys
keep
up
the
consistent
work

pretty
good
but
i
expected
more
from
ze
fatherland
an
amber
colored
octoberfest
beer
good
balance
of
bitter
and
malt
malt
toast
and
sweetness
come
through
but
well
balanced
with
the
hops
which
keep
this
from
being
a
malt
forward
beer
a
medium
light
body
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
o
i
am
normally
a
double
baltic
porter
or
stout
man
so
if
my
wife
had
not
brought
this
back
from
germany
i
might
have
never
tried
it
once
again
the
wonderful
world
of
beer
has
impressed
me
and
i
have
found
another
style
to
add
to
my
growing
list
of
must
do
again
beers
i
think
it
was
a
well
put
together
beer
from
a
well
reputed
brewer
next
time
ill
have
to
enjoy
more
than
one
pleasantly
surprised
a
delicious
light
oktoberfest
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
deep
damn
amber
deeper
than
most
without
finding
a
new
adjective
just
a
bit
of
white
head
nice
looker
soft
on
the
nose
compared
to
gl
oktober
for
example
shined
though
on
the
taste
such
a
sophisticated
balance
mouthfeel
was
v
appropriate
to
style
such
a
balance
and
enjoyability
i
may
have
not
experienced
in
oktoberfest
opening
some
eyes
as
we
speak
really
tasty
oktoberfest
pours
a
medium
brown
with
very
little
to
speak
of
in
terms
of
head
or
lacing
along
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
malty
hints
of
raisin
taste
is
also
sweet
raisin
slight
caramel
slight
chocolate
almost
syrupy
all
in
all
pretty
delicious
great
session
beer
for
the
fall
overall
its
a
good
oktoberfest
but
more
yeasty
and
grassy
than
i
would
like

o
ive
been
waiting
to
have
this
again
for
a
while
and
im

i
had
it
on

a
great

of
the
style
perfectly
executed
less

light

and

take
over
the
aftertaste
good
and
mellow
it
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
full
white
head
the
aroma
was
malt
and
malt
only
with
caramel
malt
as
the
dominant
aroma
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
perfect
sweet
malt
that
was
fully
committed
to
the
nutty
caramel
malt
profile
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
its
was
a
fully
malt
embraced
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
be
in
the
big
tents
in
munich
hoisting
a

is
excellent

that
is
a
signature
of

this

and
lower

i
make
a
point
to
pick
up
a
rack
or
two
of
this
each
year
and
look
forward
to
it
above
most
octoberfests
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
this
is
my
top
nonweisn
style
of
the
season
and
yes
i
have
had
ayinger
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
from
one
of
munichs
breweries
but
its
not
my
favorite
which
is
paulaner
that
being
said
id
still
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
love
doing
it
overall
a
great
marzen
one
of
the
best
in
terms
of
balance
and
subtle
flavors
o
marzenoctoberfest
is
a
favorite
lager
style
of
mine
this
is
a
good
example
why
overall
solid
oktoberfest
beer
not
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
still
worth
a
try
this
beer
makes
you
wish
every
fest
was
oktoberfest
sweet
yet
fullbodied
amber
colored
yet
wheat
like
light
yet
satisfying
goes
great
with
food
like
brats
at
my
next
tailgate
next
saturday
or
by
itself
and
its
fun
to
try
in
different
glassesfrom
steins
to
a
weizen
glassto
compare
life
is
good
prost
clean
and
smooth
lightly
toasted
bready
grains
maybe
sunflower
seeds
and
a
very
mild
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
barely
there
easily
drinkable
simple
and
classic
a
traditional
example
to
judge
others
against
i
suppose
fantasic
drink
autumn
in
a
glass
i
wait
all
year
for
this
beer
and
the
5
other
oktoberfest
beers
arrive
in
my
local
store
i
only
acknowledge
the
6
beers
from
munich
as
true
oktoberfest
beers
the
others
are
someones
interpretation
of
a
fest
beer
this
one
is
great
every
aspect
is
pleasing
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
way
it
could
be
better
would
be
having
served
in
the
hacker
pschorr
tent
in
munich
this
beer
was
absent
from
the
pacific
northwest
for
a
year
finally
found
it
at
my
favorite
store
malt
vine
previously
available
in
bomber
sized
bottles
now
in
a
6pack
of
11
2
oz
bottles
im
not
complaining
this
is
the
perfect
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
certainly
the
best
of
the
oktoberfests
i
have
tried
and
probably
the
best
beer
apologies
to

oktoberfest
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
you
can
enjoy
glass
after
glass
of
one
of
my
goto
fests
and
a
top
pick
among
the
many
marzens
that
flood
the
shelves
each
fall
o
when
it
comes
to
the
style
this
is
highly
recommended
summary
delicious
and
somewhat
malty
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
is
probably
my
favorite
oktoberfest
beer
out
of
germany
terrific
clarity
light
body
sweet
and
malty
aroma
and
taste
a
bit
bready
taste
with
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
the
beer
other
oktoberfests
need
to
be
compared
to
well
done
one
of
the
best
out
there
o
towards
the
end
of
hackerpschorrs
simple
and
understated
oktoberfest
the
metallic
flavor
and
mouthfeel
go
away
really
increasing
its
enjoyment
but
regardless
this
beer
is
brewed
for
sheer
drinkability
something
it
truly
excels
at
overall
tastes
like
a
wellcrafted
beer
which
i
can
appreciate
not
my
favorite
however
drinks
like
a
smoothed
out
nut
brown
ale
cleaner
and
skunkier
than
most
oktoberfests
its
aiiiiggghhtt
o
this
was
damn
good
im
glad
i
got
a
24
pack
of
these
should
last
me
about
a
week
quite
cheap
too
but
i
bought
it
wholesale
i
recommend
this
beer
for
sure
o
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
beers
available
at
this
time
of
year
once
again
got
a
chance
to
return
to
this
seasonal
favorite
it
poured
with
a
2
inch
head
that
remained
for
well
over
10
minutes
the
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
lasted
the
entire
glass
the
appearance
was
a
beautiful
dark
amber
allow
this
spirit
to
get
to
50
and
youll
really
enjoy
the
malty
goodness
at
the
end
by
far
one
of
my
top
20
beers
and
its
even
better
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
better
than
most
of
the
german
oktoberfests
ive
tried
i
prefer
more
body
and
sweetness
but
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
a
good
beer
realy
drinkable
i
can
put
theese
back
all
night
but
i
was
just
hopeing
for
a
lil
more
going
on
overall
very
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
since
they
are
not
overly
sweet
or
strong
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
good
finebubbled
pale
ambertan
head
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
cloves
and
a
firm
apple
note
almost
like
a
cider
flavor
has
a
malty
core
with
firm
notes
of
cloves
and
apple
and
hints
of
caramel
and
horehound
texture
is
crisp
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
very
refreshing
all
around
a
good
if
not
remarkable

as
in

pretty
standard
for
the

good

characteristics
with
a

of
hops
nice
overall
i
cant
think
of
anything
better
after
a
hard
day
at
work
these
guys
make
some
great
dunkel

lager
beers
so
i
expected
the

great

o

balances
well
with
the

a
translucent
red
amber
with
a
decent
white

smells
of

with
the
normal

of
some
dark

is
perfectly
carbonated

my
favorite

i
could
imagine
sinking
more
than
a
few
of
these
at
a
german
fest
well
worth
trying
i
almost
imagine
the
standards
for
good
brewing
being
discussed
over
a
few
pints
from
this
ancient
brewery
this
beer
opened
my
eyes
to
the
genius
of
german
styles
dont
start
here
end
here
o
wow
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
my
favorite

one
could
drink
many
of
these
in

this
is
a
very
enjoyable
version
of
the
style
first
time
ive
had
this
style
and
its
decent
but
not
necessarily
great
to
me
as
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
the
appearance
is
a
nice
brownishyellow
the
smell
is
a
sweet
yeasty
bready
nose
the
tongue
leans
toward
a
yeasty

not
overwhelmingly
sweet
but
a
mellow

im
liking
this

perfect
beer
for
a
late
summer
evening
in

virginia
with
the
weber
fired
up

i
think
this
just
replaced
paulaner
marzen
as
my
favorite
oktoberfestbier
cant
remember
if
i
have
tried
this
before
but
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
pleasant
medium
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
holds
and
laces
throughout
the
consumption
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruit
on
the
edges
the
taste
is
straight
up
sweet
malt
from
start
to
finish
not
much
variety
but
done
very
well
the
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
wet
as
expected
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
oktoberfest
if
i
could
get
it
fresher
it
could
go
higher
in
rating
overall
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
out
there
one
i
could
easily
drink
several
liters
of
a
prototypical
oktoberfest
lager
big
and
malty
easy
to
gulp
or
sip
who
am
i
kidding
a
nod
given
to
actual
balance
and
a
smidge
of
extra
booze
to
sneakily
keep
the
party
going
prost
prost
indeed
lighter
side
solid
easy
drinking
a
marzen
for
the
masses
kind
of
thing
pretty
true
to
the
german
style

dense
off

head
with
good
retention

down
the
glass
aromas
of

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
oktoberfest
very
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
to
drink
i
really
have
no
complaints
very
well
done
overall
whats
that
sirmixalot
song
i
like
big
butts
and
i
cannot
lie
yeah
the
back
end
on
this
beauty
makes
this
beer
beautiful
complex
assertive
finish
probably
my
favorite
octoberfest
brew
to
date
i
really
enjoyed
the
lingering
malt
flavor
in
the
finish
im
guessing
its
vienna
malt
based
on
the
style
but
cant
quite
pinpoint
it
the
taste
is
crisp
and
bready
lightly
sweet
with
herbal
hops
and
a
flavor
reminiscent
of
apple
caramel
hides
in
the
background
the
dry
grainy
malt
really
shines
in
this
beer
complimented
by
a
mediumlight
body
and
a
lightly
dry
finish
overall
mostly
a
pretty
good
octoberfest
it
has
a
decent
roasted
and
bready
flavor
and
is
quite
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
choice
d
pretty
classic
example
heavy
on
the
malt
great
autumn
beer
not
any
direct
complaints
sans
appearance
but
there
are
some
american
samples
that
i
prefer
o
there
are
only
a
few
better
than
this
example
of
the
style
a
sessionable
beer
that
is
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
tried
this
year
overall
great
oktoberfest
beer
very
drinkable
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
an
inch
of
thick
creamy
head
the
aroma
offers
malt
fairly
sweet
a
bit
fruity
a
nice
drinkable
seasonal
brew
a
bit
of
grain
with
a
balance
of
fruity
lager
and
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
solid
carbonation
hooray
beer
a
very
quality
german
oktoberfest
for
the
season
will
suit
you
just
fine
cold
or
warmed
up
a
little
bit
one
othose
beers
that
carry
over
from
the
dog
days
of
summer
right
up
to
the
snowy
front
stoop
of
wintry
days
i
know
this
a
commercial
beer
but
now
when
i
go
out
to
the
brew
pubs
there
is
one
type
of
nonamerican
style
beer
i
like
my
son
says
next
im
going
to
try
some
summerlemony
beers
doesnt
sound
too
apeeling
pun
intended
prost
read
the
excellent
subsequent
reviews
of
this
beer
i
can
do
not
better
then
what
has
already
been
written
o
year
round
oktoberfest
fucking
great
summer
days
feeling
that
marzen
style
is
awesome
they
are
part
of
setting
the
style
standard
worth
the
try
and
to
me
worth
a
case
a
week
o
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
overall
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
there
are
far
better
oktoberfest
beers
available
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavor
is
overly
bitter
in
my
opinion
for
the
style
and
the
aftertaste
is
offputting
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
bold
deep
gold
color
with
one
inch
head
and
mild
lacing
its
aroma
is
of
bread
crust
spices
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
a
complex
mix
of
ginger
bread
crust
cinnamon
and
caramel
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is

hackerpschorr
oktoberfest
marzen
is
a
good

a
good

and
very

this

is

original
oktoberfest
is
a
crystal
clear
amber
lager
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
film
it
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
like
bread
and
caramel
its
pretty
light
bodied
smooth
and
a
little
flat
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
and
metallic
it
has
a
faint
taste
of
slightly
sweet
malt
and
a
little
melanoid
theres
a
touch
of
leafy
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
grainy
and
bready
its
a
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
finished
my
pint
with
no
problem
medium
carbonation
on
a
mediumthin
body
just
the
slightest
stickiness
and
creaminess
but
generally
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
light
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
nice
take
on
the
style
an
outstanding
beer
of
its
style
and
by
far
my
favourite
beer
when
i
was
at
oktoberfest
in
2010
drinkability
is
huge
which
lets
face
it
is
the
whole
point
of
an
oktoberfest
beer

this

an
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
full
of
malts
some
toffee
nutty
smells
the
feel

the
taste
is
similar
as
it
smells
fully
of
malts
goodness
highly
recommended
this
is
oktoberfest
at
its
best
almost
perfect
for
style
ps
i
was
told
spaten
is
year
round
so
minus
points
for
spaten
for
screwing
oktobefest
up
d
overall
very
enjoyable
sad
i
now
have
to
wait
a
whole
year
to
try
it
again
overall
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
on
the
market
this
is
one
that
was
recommended
to
me
glad
i
caught
it
before
the
season
was
over
cant
wait
for
more
next
year
would
be
heaven
on
draft
overall
id
say
this
is
like
the
average
oktoberfest
nothing
special
about
it
dark
orangeamber
a
fluffy
head
nice
lacing
smell
is
mostly
just
grain
and
sweetness
but
the
taste
is
much
betterlight
malts
floral
hops
exquisite
balance
and
a
dry
clean
end
with
some
lingering
toasted
flavor
juicy
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
german
lager
done
very
right
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
a
decent
beer
for
a
cool
autumn
night
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
hackerpschorr
makes
some
of
my
favorite
bavarian
beers
but
the
oktoberfest
just
doesnt
stand
out
its
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
o
this
is
my
favorite
oktoberfest
to
date
now
if
i
could
just
keep
my
wife
out
of
them
overall
it
was
a
fine
marzen
but
it
probably
does
not
rate
as
high
with
me
as
it
does
with
other
people
like
it
i
do
this
bottles
drinking
much
better
than
the
tap
version
i
had
previously
a
pleasantly
sweet
oktoberfest
with
just
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
whole
grain
bready
malts
with
some
light
toastiness
medium
body
perfect
carbonation
and
finishes
clean
drinks
easy
id
absolutely
get
this
again
cheers
overall
it
started
out
average
but
the
complete
lack
of
any
kind
of
malt
character
on
the
tongue
ruins
it
a
bit
the
mouth
feel
doesnt
help
matters
by
being
so
watery
either
im
not
opposed
to
saying
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
but
what
i
had
this
aint
the
ofest
you
should
bother
with
o
it
makes
sense
that
these
guys
would
know
how
to
rock
a
killer
marzen
and
they
definetly
do
sampled
from
a
330
ml
bottle
on
october

2011
it
pours
a
handsome
light
to
medium
amber
witha
head
that
is
not
as
foamy
as
some
and
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
has
an
abundance
of
sweet
german
malts
and
a
yeast
background
the
body
is
about
medium
and
smooth
like
the
aroma
the
malts
take
over
the
flavor
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
but
also
a
higher
than
expected
bitterness
this
brewery
knows
its
oktobefest
styling
o
this
is
one
of
the
octoberfests
that
define
the
style
for
me
ill
continue
to
pop
lots
of
these
every
season
o
nice
crisp
marzen
but
still
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
excellent
session
beer
food
match
youll
want
something
that
coats
the
palate
while
drinking
this
brew
like
an
assortment
of
dips
hommus
and
baba
ghanoush
are
always
winners
and
bread
or
you
could
mix
it
up
with
a
tapas
or
meze
platter
o
topnotch
octoberfestmarzen
perfect
fall
evening
libation
sitting
next
to

ill
be
back

a

more

really
whip

rather
than

this
is
miles
ahead
of
the
other
three
not
that
any
of
them
were
so
bad
and
a
beer
i
cant
get
enough
of
right
now
lovely
o
solid
octoberfestmarzen
probably
one
of
my
favorite
in
a
style
that
i
usually
dont
care
much
for
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
expected
for
the
styleread
german
example
with
a
nice
balance
of
zesty
spice
and
sweet
malt
still
its
very
easy
to
put
down
lots
of
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
with
hints
of
pepper
clove
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
complex
and
much
better
than
i
anticipated
sessionable
as
well
o
this
was
a
good
beer
but
just
a
little
too
mild
compared
to
the
sprecher
which
i
liked
better
the
best
of
the
german
oktoberfests
in
my
opinion
pours
a
perfectly
clear
copper
color
with
a
picturesque
white
head
smells
earthy
and
malty
big
rich
malt
character
on
the
palate
with
a
big
enough
body
to
stand
up
to
the
season
but
not
so
big
as
to
limit
drinkability
notes
of
caramel
sweetness
are
present
in
the
crisp
finish
perfect
with
some
grilled
chicken
and
roasted
squash
edit
im
surprised
to
see
this
ranked
as
high
as
it
is
i
didnt
find
many
flaws
but
found
this
a
bit
bland
ill
likely
revisit
this
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
was
off
when
tasting
it
was
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
season
sorry
grandaddy
other
labels
hae
passed
you
up
o
for
me
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
you
mourn
seeing
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
loved
it
and
could
really
seeing
kicking
back
a
few
litersized
glass
mugs
of
it
in
munich
if
only
i
had
a
big
chewy
pretzel
to
go
with
it

highly
drinkable
enjoyable

thin

the
smell
is
common
to
most
marzens
malty
with
hints
of

the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the

mostly
malt
flavor
with
slight

the

a

the

never

caramel
and

dominate
the
flavor
too
with
honeylike
notes
as
well
and
just
enough
herbal
earthy
hops
to
balance
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
quaffable
though
the
robust
complex
flavors
make
this
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
than
it
might
otherwise
be
and
after
a
couple
of
bottles
id
be
done
overall
the
maltiness
and
mild
sweetness
of
this
brew
works
so
wonderfully
together
no
wonder
they
call
it
the
original
this
just
so
happens
to
be
the
first
oktoberfest
i
ever
tasted
many
years
ago
and
in
my
opinion
still
is
one
of
the
best
barely
decent
very
disappointing
just
had
another
octoberfest
from
an
unmarked
keg
at
a
party
it
was
very
good
this
is
dull
o
decent
beer
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
would
go
ooh
thats
nice
if
i
saw
it
on
a
beer
list
overall
a
great
märzen
that
does
not
disappoint
light
to
medium
bodied
with
slightly
below
average
carbonation
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
from
the
caramel
malt
overall
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
oktoberfest
a
try
a
very
nice
beer
o
enjoyable
and
goes
down
easy
may
be
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
yet
this
year
a
very
well
built
beer
recommended
a
lovely
example
of
the
style
with
its
rich
malt
yet
it
finishes
cleanly
and
rests
lightly
on
the
palate
overall
pleasant
though
unremarkable
if
this
was
available
in
six
packs
for
a
decent
price
i
would
rip
through
it
really
puts
little
creatures
version
to
shame
and
cements
my
thoughts
on
that
effort
i
thought
the
beer
was
wellbalanced
it
has
its
own
character
that
stands
on
its
own
i
think
its
one
of
many
good
examples
of
this
style
i
particularly
like
ayinger
but
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
dang
good
somehow
this
ofest
has
eluded
me
for
years
not
no
more
it
pours
a
clear
tawnyamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
white
bread
light
caramel
light
grass
and
a
very
light
touch
of
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
follows
this
fairly
closely
but
the
caramel
is
more
pronounced
and
a
decent
amount
of
mandarin
orange
finds
its
way
in
as
well
providing
a
nice
fruitiness
to
compliment
the
enhanced
malt
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
solid
ofest
one
definitely
worthy
of
that
bavarian
flag
emblazoned
around
the
label
o
as
for
many
german
lagers
the
overall
grade
is
higher
than
the
average
the
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
and
thanks
to
its
subtle
complexity
you
never
get
tired
of
it
overall
a
very
good
marzen
pretty
much
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
o
i
have
had
this
beer
for
the
last
three
years
i
only
realized
recently
that
i
had
never
reviewed
it
september
and
fall
are
one
of
the
best
times
of
the
year
to
be
a
beer
drinker
hackerpschorrs
oktoberfest
delivers
a
beautiful
color
matched
by
nice
mellow
and
balanced
flavors
if
you
enjoy
oktoberfest
and
fall
seasonal
beers
try
this
d
i
really
felt
like
i
chewed
this
beer
rather
than
drank
it
but
it
still
retained
its
great
lager
cleanliness
liquid
doughy
bread
with
a
subtle
toffee
sweetness
superb
this
is
far
darker
than
the
beer
in
the
hacker
festzelt
at
oktoberfest
though
wonder
whats
going
on
there
overall
an
easydrinking
german
brew
sure
though
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
bland
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
chewy
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
drinks
pretty
nice
although
it
felt
a
little
flat
ive
definitely
had
some
better
marzens
o
yeah
at
first
i
was
into
it
but
the
finish
was
offputting
and
at
the
end
of
it
i
couldnt
think
of
this
as
a
great
marzen
kinda
underwhelmed
by
it
o
a
pretty
nice
oktoberfest
the
flavor
is
very
clean
refreshing
and
simple
overall
a
very
classy
oktoberfest

best
marzen
i
had
today
overallnothing
to
complain
about
just
not
perfect
maybe
a
little
more
sweetness
would
help
o
this
is
always
a
solid
choice
when
weighing
out
your
oktoberfest
options
for
me
it
brings
back
fond
memories
of
visiting
munich
for
oktoberfest
i
was
in
the
hacker
pschorr
tent
with
a
giant
pretzel
around
my
neck
singing
country
roads
with
my
new
drinking
buddies
from
italy
and
austria
good
times
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
oktoberfest
bier
im
sure
its
better
fresh
on
tap
in
munich
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
was
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
for
a
traditional
german
oktoberfest
cheers
even
though
the
appearance
and
smell
had
me
leery
this
is
a
very
good
beer
although
the
sweetness
might
catch
up
to
me
after
a
while
as
a
yank
i
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
several
of
these
while
partying
in
a
bavarian
beer
hall
firm
enough
carbonation
and
good
mouthfeel
really
drinkable
smooth
tasty
the
whole
nine
yards
this
is
what
the
fall
is
all
about

pretty
standard

a
good

some

on

after

sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
marzen
but
nothing
too
special
dpretty
easy
drinking
but
i
wish
this
had
a
little
bit
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
it
the
search
for
my
ideal
german
oktoberfest
continues
its
probably
the
least
oktoberfest
marzen
ive
had
to
date
less
malty
thin
body
and
weak
head
and
lacing
hurts
the
credentials
of
this
brew
its
decent
but
you
can
do
a
lot
better
many
great
german
oktoberfest
brews
out
there
this
one
is
a
little
less
overall
better
than
other
german
oktoberfests
ive
has
thus
far
and
its
pretty
good
very
good
example
of
a
style
i
tend
to
overlook
i
figured
id
try
an
authentic
german
oktoberfest
this
year
definitely
a
step
or
two
above
most
american
examples
o
this
is
the
nice
fest
beer
better
than
most
american
renditions
i
have
sampled
o
i
always
look
forward
to
this
one
i
like
the
ayinger
oktoberest
a
bit
more
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
hackerpschorrs
oktoberfestmarzen
is
a
very
clear
darkeramber
colored
beer
small
white
head
which
doesnt
last
too
long
nice
amount
of
vienna
malt
on
the
nose
fairly
toasty
and
pretty
sweet
very
rich
scent
ooh
here
we
go
just
a
full
on
smattering
of
vienna
malts
nice
and
toasty
quite
bready
a
bit
of
caramel
nice
and
clean
lagered
taste
hops
are
minimal
but
play
a
nice
balance
with
their
bitterness
very
nice
and
smooth
mouth
pretty
creamy
and
soft
on
the
tongue
just
the
right
amount
of
smooth
toasted
maltiness
for
this
style
and
a
creamy
wellbalanced
palate
theres
a
nice
subtle
hoppy
assertiveness
and
a
hint
of
allspice
on
the
finish
silkysmooth
and
wonderfully
drinkable
recommended
mehr
bitte
light
acidity
with
moderate
carbonation
just
a
classic
example
of
the
style
decent
color
but
a
little
thin
looking
very
full
flavor
with
a
tiny
hint
of
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
hoppier
but
doesnt
linger
long
i
could
see
drinking
a
good
bit
of
it
and
its
a
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
do
much
do
distinguish
itself
in
my
mind
from
other
specimens
ive
had
had
on
tap
at
the
platt
in
franlin
square
at
the
umternational
talkbass
annual
get
together
showed
up
in
a
mug
nice
ruby
chestnut
color
malty
festive
smell
not
the
best
smelling
octoberfest
but
not
the
worst
great
body
and
nice
flavor
grape
dominant
a
little
heavy
but
very
enjoyable
overall
very
good
this
one
pours
out
as
an
amber
color
with
a
head
that
comes
and
goes
leaving
a
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
along
with
some
autumn
aromas
the
taste
is
decent
its
got
some
earthy
spice
flavors
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
or
at
least
close
to
medium
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
ive
had
better
though
a
nice
coppery
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
nice
walls
of
lace
teh
smell
is
of
caramels
honey
cereal
and
some
earthy
herbal
peppery
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
rich
caramel
dominating
notes
of
earthy
hops
herbal
and
peppery
hints
and
some
fruity
qualities
like
apricot
peach
and
a
touch
of
lemon
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
nice
rich
caramel
swirls
balance
things
out
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
caramel
and
peppery
hops
overall
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
but
im
just
not
in
the
oktoberfest
mood
this
time
of
year
not
one
i
would
go
looking
for
but
if
a
friend
had
it
in
the
fridge
i
definitely
wouldnt
say
no
taste
mild

no

its

i
liked
this
one
quite
a
lot
and
will
make
sure
to
pick
some
up
each
year
happy
to
try
it
first
had
this

at

poured
them
into

takes

dissipate
it
is
a
smooth

that
is

d
very
good
beer
would
love
to
go
to

drink
many
of
these
d
pretty

really
wasnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
pretty
average

d
pretty

a

brew
over
some

i
have
had

brew
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
i
recommend
trying
this
brew

you
like
the

a

the
best

is
its

the
flavor
is
similar
to

is

and
unremarkable
the

is

and

ok
octoberfest

there
are

by
it
i

why
people
like
this

so

i
am
not

if
i
just
need
a
more
fresh
sample
or
what
some
retention

not

is

thats

you
like

is

carbonation
overall
and
a
yeast
presence
somewhat
earthy
but
in
a
good
way
it
tastes
like
a
delicious
märzen
beer
that
would
be
enjoyed
under
an
oktoberfest
tent
only
cold

it
was
in

before
the
rest
of
my
review
this
beer
was
the
clear
winner
in
my
book
the
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
crystal
clear
orange
color
and
gives
off
a
very
strong
very
nice
toasted
malt
scent
the
toasted
malt
scent
continues
into
a
rich
toasted
malt
fairly
think
and
sweet
taste
thats
got
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
richness
of
the
beer
absolutely
delicious
and
quite
easy
to
drink
not
bad
but
not
great
very
satisfying
marzen
here

sour
with
a
hint
of
something
astringent
over
all
its
really
decent
and
highly
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
i
buy
this
almost
every
year
this
oktoberfest
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
tall
creamy
yellowtinted
foam
that
settled
but
left
some
lace
the
smell
was
malty
with
notes
of
cocoa
and
caramel
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
richly
malty
with
light
sweetness
there
were
hints
of
caramel
and
cocoa
with
a
nice
hoppy
sharpness
in
the
finish
there
was
also
a
bit
off
munich
malt
flavor
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
crisp
finish
the
body
was
medium
with
medium
carbonation
this
was
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
oktoberfest
bier
big
soda
style
orangish
cream
colored
head
becomes
creamy
as
is
continues
to
hold
like
a
champ
swarming
clouds
of
bubbles
rise
through
the
orange
tinged
golden
beer
broken
rings
of
lace
as
the
beer
disappears
well
rounded
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
aroma
carries
over
into
the
flavor
which
is
just
on
the
sweet
side
medium
body
light
and
smooth
on
the
mouth
clear
lighter
copper
color
with
a
head
that
starts
like
frothy
milk
but
dissipates
fairly
quickly
big
but
scant
looping
laces
nice
caramel
nose
mostly
on
the
malt
side
mouthfeel
is
relativley
full
for
style
medium
and
slightly
sticky
in
impression
lower
carbonation
flavor
is
fine
if
slightly
unidimensional
aspects
of
the
aroma
are
emphasized
again
slightest
toastiness
speck
of
spiciness
throughout
sits
comfortably
as
representative
of
style
but
lately
fresher
american
examples
on
tap
are
motivating
me
more
i
was
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
this
beer
before
ive
picked
up
six
packs
of
this
for
years
and
years
i
wont
mince
words
here
weve
had
an
oktoberfest
party
with
beer
competiton
for
the
last
8
years
with
over
25
judges
male
female
comparing
oktoberfest
brews
from
everywhere
in
the
world
and
this
one
is
the
reigning
champ
we
bring
in
new
challengers
every
year
but
this
brew
still
captures
most
of
the
praise
at
our
annual
oktoberfest
i
could
drink
this
beer
everyday
and
so
could
most
of
my
friends
an
all
time
favorite
in
our
large
circle
of
friends
what
a
beautiful
beer
this
is
while
its
being
poured
into
the
glass
excellent
copper
color
thats
clear
and
brilliant
nice
dense
tan
head
mild
aromas
of
malt
and
hops
just
a
balanced
and
clean
aroma
great
malty
mouthfeel
hints
of
being
thick
and
syrupy
but
i
could
definetly
knock
back
a
few
liters
of
this
any
day
finally
picked
this
beer
up
after
passing
it
a
number
of
times
over
the
years
and
was
glad
that
i
finally
did
it
the
beer
had
a
wonderful
malty
aroma
that
went
down
very
smooth
with
a
mild
taste
with
not
much
of
a
strong
aftertaste
if
there
is
hops
in
this
brew
i
could
not
taste
them
beer
was
a
dark
copper
that
gave
way
to
a
nice
head
would
definately
drink
this
beer
again
and
the
best
octoberfest
i
have
had
this
season
just
what
ive
been
looking
for
very
nicecrystal
clear
coppery
color
little
or
no
head
but
a
decent
carbonation
level
nice
aromasomewhat
toasted
malt
slightly
grainy
malty
flavor
up
front
vey
slight
hop
bitterness
nice
malty
mouthfeel
as
well
an
extremely
drinkable
beerwould
reccomend
this
to
any
macro
drinker
as
a
good
training
wheel
beer
vey
well
balanced
overall
indeed
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
too
strong
in
the
finish
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
anytime
of
the
year
i
had
one
of
these
while
jamming
with
a
friend
of
my
dads
and
this
beer
was
perfect
for
the
occasion
a
great
german
oktoberfest
brew
that
holds
true
to
the
style
highly
recommended
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
could
easily
see
me
drinking
a
large
mug
of
this
at
oktoberfest
overall
a
classic
oktoberfrest
if
you
find
it
buy
it
over
paulaner
dn
not
the
best
marzen
out
there
but
a
beer
id
definitely
recommend
someone
try
the
beer
is
simple
flavorwise
but
what
is
here
is
quite
enjoyable
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
may
not
be
too
memorable
by
some
but
i
will
remember
this
as
being
a
good
easy
to
drink
amber
lager
whether
it
be
early
fall
or
latespring
the
oktoberfest
is
on
tap
year
round
at
a
local
eatery
sometimes
it
can
get
really
aged
and
lose
a
lot
of
flavor
not
to
mention
carbonation
but
when
they
have
tapped
a
new
keg
its
really
good
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
large
head
the
smell
is
maltiness
with
a
hops
background
the
taste
is
smoky
malt
with
a
kicker
of
hoppiness
just
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
it
has
a
clean
moderately
thick
feel
in
the
mouth
when
fresh
it
is
hard
to
stop
at
one
john
pours
a
deep
amber
with
reddish
tints
little
head
with
no
retention
and
minor
lace
aroma
is
caramel
malt
some
bread
or
yeast
hints
with
minor
hop
bitterings
flavor
is
smooth
malt
with
minor
bitter
hint
somehat
one
dimensional
but
very
tasty
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
just
made
to
drink
out
a
litr
stein
i
find
that
the
caramel
taste
stays
fairly
true
even
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
after
tasting
this
beer
i
figure
that
this
is
what
an
oktoberfest
should
be
amberorange
in
appearence
with
a
beautiful
head
sweet
caramel
with
very
subtle
hops
but
the
sweetness
dominates
after
finishing
a
pint
it
only
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
this
is
definately
an
authentic
oktoberfest
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
from
the
mixture
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
darker
version
of
a
lager
beer
it
is
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfests
but
its
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
is
crisp
yet
uninspired
a
good
medium
body
an
ending
tangyness
to
the
mouthfeel
is
not
good
but
not
a
beer
buster
either
it
drinks
easy
a
fine
oktoberfest
it
is
just
not
my
favorite
it
is
definately
worth
trying
one
pours
to
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
bready
with
hints
of
grain
the
flaovr
is
malty
and
somewhat
bready
and
toffeelike
it
is
also
a
tad
bit
astringent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
a
drying
finish
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
one
pint
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
nice
lacing
present
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
also
fairly
sweet
with
a
good
hops
finish
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
above
average
a
darn
solid
brew
a
light
coppery
amber
with
a
shortlived
white
head
that
left
a
thin
lace
coating
the
nose
is
strong
bready
malt
accompanied
by
the
presence
of
noble
hops
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
compared
with
the
others
in
the
field
a
simple
malt
profile
and
hardly
any
finish
at
all
a
bit
strong
at
5
8
which
minimizes
drinkability
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
with
a
sidesaddle
fraulein
sp
atop
a
big
black
horse
on
the
label
its
a
very
eyepleasing
copper
with
a
white
head
thats
initially
thick
and
leaves
a
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
toffee
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
dominate
the
smell
at
first
it
almost
seems
too
sweet
but
things
end
up
balancing
nicely
after
a
few
sips
this
stuff
is
really
easy
to
drink
good
thing
its
brewed
yearround
a
great
oktoberfest
from
a
great
munchen
brewery
wellbalanced
and
full
of
taste
this
certainly
stands
up
with
the
best
of
the
season
hopefully
ill
have
this
one
again
next
year
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
mouthfeel
true
to
style
and
nicely
done
medium
creaminess
while
still
thin
in
the
perfect
way
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
seem
to
like
better
than
their
seasonal
marzen
has
a
rather
luscious
and
creamy
texture
golden
ruby
in
color
with
a
nice
think
foamy
head
atop
nice
malty
aroma
with
some
caramel
and
nuts
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
has
a
great
malt
base
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
that
nuttiness
again
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
light
enough
that
you
could
drink
many
and
flavorful
enough
that
you
would
want
to
amber
colored
as
described
on
the
label
this
is
one
of
the
darker
octoerfests
from
germany
starts
with
the
emphasis
on
the
light
caramel
malt
flavors
with
big
malt
nose
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
in
the
middle
followed
with
a
lightly
dry
finish
a
bit
light
bodied
for
the
style
a
very
drinkable
lager
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
strength
to
it
probably
my
favorite
german
octoberfest
overall
a
solid
octoberfest
drinkability
an
average
oktoberfest
would
be
willing
to
try
again
next
year
for
comparison
this
is
a
very
nice
ofest
beer
a
mediumsized
creamcolored
densebutcoarse
head
sits
on
top
the
dark
amberreddish
clear
beer
vanilla
and
peanuts
are
strange
complements
in
the
tangy
malty
nose
the
taste
starts
tangy
moves
through
malty
with
chocolate
highlights
and
settles
on
a
zingy
almost
ryelike
nutty
finish
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
tasty
but
really
needs
to
warm
to
show
its
full
sweet
body
poured
a
beautiful
clear
copper
under
a
small
offwhite
head
that
fizzled
quickly
and
left
no
discernible
lace
the
nose
was
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
nuts
and
caramel
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
here
to
offset
a
fairly
heavy
mouth
the
tongue
detects
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
followed
by
a
very
nice
hoppy
bite
that
just
gets
more
insistent
as
the
brew
warms
the
aftertaste
is
a
lovely
combination
of
sweet
malt
and
hoppy
tones
i
sure
could
see
myself
downing
a
few
mass
of
this
elixir
yum
i
must
have
had
an
old
bottle
last
year
cuz
this
year
the
hacker
pschorr
ofest
is
very
solid
nice
clear
copper
color
minimal
off
white
head
aroma
of
toasted
malt
is
dominant
and
pleasing
the
body
of
the
beer
is
damn
near
full
chewy
thick
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
vienna
like
toastiness
and
underlying
biscuit
toffee
tones
in
the
background
add
to
the
subtle
complexity
this
is
a
good
one
ladies
and
gents
clear
orangecopper
color
nice
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
in
my
glass
aroma
of
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
sweet
bready
and
malty
caramel
flavors
light
to
medium
body
with
a
roasted
and
sweet
finish
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
i
think
i
will
have
another
probably
the
benchmark
oktoberfest
beer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
a
fall
staple
without
a
doubt
highly
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
appearance
copper
amber
hue
with
a
nice
two
finger
sized
cream
off
white
colored
head
and
a
perfectly
even
pattern
of
specks
scattered
equidistantly
aroma
caramel
malts
toasted
to
perfection
wow
this
is
my
go
to
german
oktoberfest
bier
simply
kicks
ass
some
light
german
hops
going
on
in
there
but
perfect
blend
taste
a
creamy
edge
of
caramel
toasted
malts
so
good
but
the
bitter
streak
running
through
it
is
perfect
the
german
lager
stands
out
from
the
rest
that
i
have
tried
really
good
stuff
here
i
must
say
after
trying
all
of
these
back
to
back
amazing
ofests
im
about
to
call
it
my
favorite
style
for
awhile
mouthfeel
clean
crisp
refreshing
lighter
body
not
as
much
texture
as
some
but
still
very
good
and
smooth
drinkability
just
as
good
as
any
classic
representations
i
like
the
extra
bitterness
compared
to
some
other
malt
monsters
of
this
style
not
overly
hopped
just
more
prevalent
than
others
i
have
tasted
amberorange
brew
with
a
tannish
head
which
pours
very
large
but
settles
becoming
thin
and
scattered
aroma
of
sourdough
bread
malt
and
spicy
hops
with
a
grainy
undertone
the
taste
is
mainly
of
malts
but
hops
provide
a
good
crisp
and
spicy
backbone
starts
off
with
lots
of
bready
and
grainy
malt
and
a
good
hop
bite
just
a
little
caramel
is
noticeable
finishes
very
crisp
with
some
bitterness
but
not
without
a
little
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
very
crisp
and
refreshing
not
as
bigbodied
as
some
other
märzens
but
still
very
good
in
its
own
way
this
is
second
only
to
paulaners
among
my
favorite
oktoberfestbiers
poured
a
light
red
color
that
lacked
a
head
nose
of
malt
and
spice
taste
is
very
subtle
and
low
in
carbonation
bready
malts
show
but
no
flavor
really
come
out
and
shows
itself
to
me
slight
hoppiness
towards
the
end
along
with
some
spice
this
one
was
alright
but
lacked
didnt
have
the
characteristics
that
would
make
it
a
good
oktoberfest
mediumcopper
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
stitched
a
patchwork
quilt
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
good
dose
of
malt
and
caramel
in
the
nose
brief
hints
of
spicy
hops
noted
as
well
also
a
bit

scent
escapes
from
the
glass
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
pumpkin
pie
mostly
caramel
and
some
toasted
malts
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
and
as
it
disjoins
the
lace
forms
a
concealing
sheet
upon
the

the

you

but
this
could
make
an
exceptional
crossover
beer
my
bud
drinking
fatherinlaw
loves
it
almost
cereal
like
mouthfeel
dark
tan
head
that
shrinks
to
a
thin
film
sweet
caramel
malts
as
well
as
a
subtle
toasty
quality
in
the
aroma
smooth
and
sweet
carmale
malt
opens
the
beer
up
much
sweeter
and
stronger
caramel
qualities
than
most
of
the
others
of
the
style
ive
tried
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
and
not
cloying
or
sticky
lightly
toasty
munich
and
toffeeish
malt
nose
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
drops
shortly
but
leaves
a
good
collar
and
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
of
vienna
malt
lightly
sweet
beautiful
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
aroma
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
wonderful
biscuit
malt
taste
throughout
the
beer
unlike
other
beers
in
the
style
the
sweetness
is
genuine
and
not
overpowering
dark
golden
color
with
a
stable
substantial
head
terrifically
drinkable
this
is
still
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
now
heres
an
elite
octoberfest
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
nose
is
outstanding
featuring
caramel
and
biscuits
body
is
about
perfect
for
this
style
smooth
texture
too
the
taste
has
to
be
the
best
in
the
style
a
nice
mellow
caramel
taste
along
with
some
breadiness
noble
hops
impart
a
nice
balance
very
drinkable
very
tasty
very
outstanding
this
is
one
of
the
top
oktoberfest
beers
in
my
book
i
get
this
by
the
case
only
though
they
have
switched
to
sturdy
12oz
long
neck
bottles
i
guess
for
better
shipping
mediumlight
bodied
gently
carbonated
works
nicely
in
the
mouth
a
person
could
suck
down
a
whole
lot
of
these
mild
hop
bitterness
with
full
malt
flavor
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
caramel
taste
that
brings
you
back
for
more
although
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
on
body
its
still
a
must
try
deep
dark
orange
borders
on
red
small
tight
head
film
remains
to
end
clean
carmelized
malt
aroma
with
some
spicy
hops
flavor
starts
sweet
very
malty
clean
and
rich
turns
oily
slick
slighty
spicy
and
lasts
forever
reminds
me
of

finished
this

twice
as
fast
as
all

others
and
will
be
going
back
to
get
a

more
hackerpschorr
original
ofest
nice
orange
color
with
very
little
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
down
the
sides
clean
aroma
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
of
nicely
balanced
malt
flavors
in
the
traditional
ofest
flavor
with
a
spicy
flavor
of
hops
rounding
out
the
beer
very
nicely
very
nice
hps
yearround
offering
average
looking
for
an
ofest
orangeybrown
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
that
vanishes
poof
its
gone
aroma
has
subtle
malty
aspects
caramel
buttered
cinnamon
bread
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
maltiness
but
its
subtle
not
syrupysweet
in
fact
its
rather
pleasant
in
its
subtlety
some
mild
hop
flavors
mostly
floral
and
although
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
is
i
can
tell
you
its
pretty
low
making
for
an
imminently
drinkable
festive
session
beer
amber
in
color
with
minimal
head
and
decent
carbonation
the
aroma
is
slightly
caramel
mostly
malt
the
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
spicyalcohol
aftertaste
it
is
a
bit
thin
for
mouthfeel
but
very
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
not
a
very
distinctive
oktoberfest
given
its
munich
roots
the
body
is
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
but
the
slim
whitish
head
disappeared
too
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
caramel
malt
mixture
but
my
bottle
had
a
rather
funky
soapy
odor
on
top
the
taste
has
the
necessary
maltiness
but
barely
and
the
body
seems
a
bit
weak
overall
i
expected
much
more
from
this
brewery
pours
a
deep
bright
amber
almost
orange
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
on
the
nose
there
is
the
aroma
of
toasted
malts
touch
of
caramel
on
the
palate
it
is
medium
bodied
toasted
malts
caramel
flavors
slight
graininess
slight
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
metallic
flavor
which
went
away
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
overall
this
was
a
very
good
oktoberfest
brew
it
pours
with
a
white
head
nothing
special
here
over
gently
carbonated
clear
medium

liquid

is

with
a

then
fading
into
a
blandish
finish
pretty
onedimensional
beer
here
although
good
for
quaffing
in
mass
quantities
sort
of
the
lawnmower
beer
of
oktoberfests
not
putting
it
down
i
just
feel
there
are
more
out
there
that

cheers
i
dont
know
if
something
was
up
with
this
on
draught
but
it
tasted
really
funny
it
had
a
somewhat
strong
taste
of
vinegar
in
it
the
quality
oktoberfest
was
hidden
in
the
back
and
it
was
still
a
decent
brew
but
it
was
just
not
the
same
beer
i
was
so
accustomed
to
i
cant
imagine
how
it
was
so
much
different
especially
that
it
was
not
as
good
on
draught
clear
light
amber
in
color
large
loosely
packed
bubbles
clean
tasting
with
a
pleasant
malt
taste
less
bitter
than
some
other
similar
beers
quite

i
sampled
this
on
draught
very
nice
notes
this
is
hackerpschorrs
year
round
oktoberfest
offerning
not
to
be
confused
with
their
seasonal
oktoberfestmärzen
its
a
perfect
oktoberfest
brewed
with
enjoyment
and
a
session
of
drinking
in
mind
not
strong
and
very
drinkable
87
my
bottle
was
well
past
its
prime
i
didnt
see
the
date
on
the
lower
right
corner
of
the
label
until
i
got
home
i
should
know
better
than
to
shop
at
places
that
will
let
a
beer
rot
on
the
shelf
until
it
sells
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
this
beer
had
held
up
nice
solid
maltyness
with
just
enough
hops
and
sweetness
at
the
finish
a
very
pleasant
marzen
i
had
this
on
draught
recently
and
was
severely
disappointed
it
was
thin
and
had
a
metallic
taste
that
made
it
unpleasant
the
trip
over
must
of
skunked
the
keg
spaten
may
be
the
urmarzen
but
i
think
i
may
prefer
hackerpschorrs
version
a
bigger
malt
flavor
gives
it
the
nod
better
than
average
domestic
oktoberfest
arguably
no
country
takes
more
pride
in
the
quality
of
its
beers
than
germany
its
hard
to
live
up
to
standards
set
by
centuries
of
proud
brewing
tradition
nonetheless
blue
point
has
made
an
honorable
effort
that
while
it
doesnt
quite
rank
on
par
is
a
nice
ode
to
the
more
traditional
original
versions
of
oktoberfest
beers
but
its
certainly
nothing
to
celebrate
about
good
flavor
but
sweet
for
an
oktoberfest
beer
o
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
or
even
more
interesting
dont
think
that
i
will
grab
this
one
again
as
it
is
just
fairly
mundane
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
the
taste
is
not
very
threatening
toasted
malts
sweetness
and
a
bitter
finish
this
is
a
fairly
ordinary
beer
although
it
is
easy
to
drink
o
drinkable
but
not
all
that
interesting
everything
about
this
was
ok
taste
ok
slight
after
taste
body
kept
some
less
than
ok
components
at
the
3
line
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
that
good
either
another
surprising
screwtop
i
used
a
heavyhanded
pour
which
resulted
in
a
pseudocascade
this
settled
fairly
quickly
into

of

mammon

midas
showed
up
clamoring
for

i
watched
bemused
as
the
head
fell
leaving
behind
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
and
i
was
thinking
about
some
gelt
for
me
nose
was
very
biscuitlike
quite
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
was
both
biscuity
and
grassy
a
nice
combination
of
malts
and
hops
that
proved
to
be
eminently
drinkable
the
finish
evinced
a
slight
honeylike
sweetness
something
often
found
in
the
quality
lagers
but
overall
i
would
still
classify
it
as
semidry
this
is
a
pretty
classic
medium
body
with
modest
amount
of
carbonation
somewhat
crisp
but
that
candylike
sweetness
could
be
tamed
down
a
bit
to
make
it
overall
more
enjoyable
where
the
beers
caramel
flavor
pushes
it
slightly
outside
of
its
style
parameters
it
begins
to
resemble
an
amber
ale
as
much
as
it
does
oktoberfest
but
even
with
its
american
liberties
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
humble
overall
this
is
another
very
solid
american
example
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
nicely
balanced
extremely
quaffable
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
ill
certainly
add
it
to
my
oktoberfest
rotation
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
fruity
and
earthy
underpinnings
pours
a
clear
orangy
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
wheat
head
that
leaves
generous
lacing
lipsmacking
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
firm
tones
of
cloves
fruit

smooth

whatsoever
just
a
really
average
beer
i
love
marzenoctoberfest
but
this
one
is
just
blah
i
bought
a
variety
pack
and
this
one
was
disappointing
the
flavor
hits
early
and
fades
late
which
seems
like
a
trend
from
this
brewery
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
free
but
i
doubt
ill
pay
for
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
though
given
how
nice
their
vienna
lager
is
i
expected
a
bit
better
beer
still
this
is
a
smooth
and
very
drinkable
offering
the
flavors
border
on
fruity
to
a
bit
of
a
fault
pale
apple
sweet

the
main

in
the
flavor
caramel

are
absent
or
at
least
masked
quite
well
under
a
covering
of
sweet

character

combining
a

with

and
some
floral

hops
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
pilsener
style
beer
its
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
its
not
the
worst
i
think
it
costs
more
than
its
worth
but
its
solid
i
was
interested
in
trying
it
but
it
was
nothing
special
average
beer
there
are
adjunct
lagers
out
there
from
the
us
that
are
as
good
as
this
one
for
a
quarter
of
the
price
the
taste
is
very
good
with
good
malt
body
and
light
yeast
in
the
front
wtih
slight
hop
giving
a
mild
citrus
and
light
spiced
with
subtle
sweetness
and
light
dry
malt
yeast
essence
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
enjoyable
and
went
well
with
my
bacon
and
egg
breakfast
taconice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
there
was
nothing
here
resembling
a
festbier
this
was
fairly
bland
overall
sweet
bready
malts
that
come
across
as
kind
of
adjuncty
maybe
a
little
grassy
hop
at
the
end
heavy
feeling
overall
at
the
time
of
this
writing
this
beer
is
classified
as
an
ofest
the
hell
did
i
miss
whatever
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
fresh
flowers
grass
mild
biscuit
and
a
very
slight
twinge
of
pine
needle
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
flowers
and
grass
really
shining
brightly
showing
off
what
simplicity
can
achieve
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
this
was
a
damn
fine
beer
awful
for
an
ofest
one
whose
popularity
here
i
can
easily
understand
good
times
but
went
down
pretty
well
for
the
price
about
94pack
of
16
9
oz
cans
its
neither
cheap
nor
expensive
but
cheap
enough
and
good
enough
that
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
a
4pack
of
this
a
couple
times
a
year
a
great
break
from
the
american
hop
scene
12
liter
bottle
of
austrian
lager
stiegl
im
accustomed
to
seeing
the
pils
around
my
area
the
local
college
in
steubenville
has
an
exchange
program
with
a
college
in
austria
all
of
the
catholic
college
kids
come
back
state
side
with
a
craving
for
this
industrial
style
lager
from
salzburg
a
deep
golden
akin
to
apple
juice
with
a
large
white
head
forming
thick
with
flowing
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
in
the
glass
speckled
lacing
sporadic
but
there
the
nose
has
nice
floralherbal
hops
in
the
back
end
with
an
upfront
bread
dough
sweetness
with
hints
of
cooked
vegetable
pretty
straight
forward
euro
lager
truth
be
told
but
pretty
clean
so
far
an
enjoyable
rolling
malt
sweetness
think
biscuit
malt
with
some
mineral
water
just
enough
herbal
hops
to
give
it
a
zing
completely
clean
dry
crisp
lagered
finish
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
in
number
not
complex
at
all
but
doesnt
really
set
out
to
be
that
type
of
beer
this
is
industrial
style
mass
produced
lager
with
a
decent
flavor
i
cant
complain
it
is
what
it
is
not
leaps
and
bounds
above
an
american
style
light
lager
but
theres
more
tradition
in
this
glass
than
your
average
bmc
goldbrau
is
right
it
says
it
all
its
gold
beer
highly
force
carbonated
yet
finishes
clean
with
just
enough
hop
snap
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
if
those
college
kids
want
to
relive
their
semester
abroad
more
power
to
them
i
can
see
the
sentimental
value
in
a
lot
of
bad
beers
this
is
just
extremely
middle
of
the
road
to
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
had
a
glass
at
1600
bier
haus
in
calgary
a
bit
of
a
rarity
on
tap
one
is
more
likely
to
run
into
its
german
pils
stablemate
the
darker
goldbrau
is
in
fact
pretty
light
maybe
just
on
the
orange
side
of
lemon
yellow
with
a
little
white
foam
aroma
is
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
corn
id
be
surprised
if
there
is
actual
corn
in
here
but
perhaps
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
a
funky
off
note
that
actually
sort
of
works
since
it
is
subtle
and
far
from
overpowering
old
wet
malt
anyhow
taste
is
quite
tart
and
acidic
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
brown
sugar
and
sweet
dough
with
a
little
noble
hop
spice
and
a
mellow
sweet
cherry
note
a
bit
like
cherry
gum
that
shows
up
early
and
persists
through
the
crisp
finish
a
subdued
but
classy
and
wellexecuted
oktoberfest
just
this
side
of
a
pils
or
euro
lager
really
in
terms
of
appearance
and
flavor
but
with
some
rich
malt
character
and
no
obvious
flaws
stiegl

premium
lager

this
is
not
what
i
could
consider
premium
if
you
want
a
thin
beer
that
tastes
almost
infected
then
grab
a
bottle
of
this
other
than
that
avoid
o
i
like
it
very
different
than
anything
my
young
pallet
has
ever
tasted
before
good
balance
i
can
hear
the
hops
but
theyre
not
blowing
out
my
eardrums
might
not
be
an
alltimegreat
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
o
overall
im
very
impressed
by
this
austrian
beer
very
tasty
this
was
a
fantastic
surprise
o
definitely
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
one
ill
buy
again
and
one
ill
offer
to
friends
an
excellent
way
to
pull
people
up
out
of
the
miry
clay
of
millerbudcoors
o
decent
beer
good
for
a
couple
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
quite
flavorful
marzen
on
tap
at
falling
rock
i
got
this
with
a
sandwich
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
pliny
the
younger
tapping
was
looking
for
the
least
offensive
most
neutral
brew
i
could
find
as
i
needed
to
clear
the
palate
for
what
i
knew
would
be
one
of
the
best
beers
of
all
time
it
came
in
a
pint
glass
perfectly
clear
and
golden
with
a
finger
or
so
of
thick
white
fluff
the
nose
was
super
fresh
very
very
german
in
origin
from
the
malt
fits
all
the
stereotypes
but
seems
to
have
more
body
than
some
of
the
standard
offerings
in
this
style
unfortunately
though
the
nose
is
this
beers
best
feature
it
tastes
a
little
old
mildly
metallic
and
lazily
handled
the
malt
freshness
didnt
come
through
the
thicker
body
and
there
was
a
starchy
flavor
to
this
that
just
dragged
the
whole
thing
down
i
didnt
even
get
spicy
food
and
it
couldnt
clear
my
palate
for
me
it
got
even
more
heavy
as
it
warmed
and
left
me
pretty
unsatisfied
although
i
will
say
again
that
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
very
promising
and
i
will
have
to
give
the
bottled
version
a
fair
shake
at
some
point
overall
a
very
plain
beer
something
for
the
bmc
drinker
in
your
life
since
its
a
tad
more
hoppy
than
the
generic
stuff
but
its
not
worth
the
import
price
rjt
not
really
a
marzen
or
helles
by
any
stretch
more
like
an
allmalt
american
malty
perfumed
pleasant
easy
watery
hopless
and
forgettable
the
best
austrian
lager
ive
tasted
which
is
not
necessarily
a
compliment
this
may
be
a
little
better
than
serbian
or
romanian
lagers
you
could
pour
this
down
your
gullet
for
a
thirst
quencher
but
even
heineken
has
more
flavor
o
despite
the
atrocious
look
this
is
a
passable
brew
nice
beer
nothing
to
write
at
home
about
but
pleasanty
drinkable
i
dont
have
any
other
austrian
beer
examples
to
compare
but
i
find
it
quite
good
im
reviewing
this
as
a
helles
lager
not
sure
why
this
is
under
the
oktoberfest
style
on
here
very
bright
and
traditional
flavors
with
incredible
balance
i
could
have
easily
had
2
liters
of
this
stuff
overall
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
slam
but
this
beer
taste
a
bit
like
corona
the
beer
is
nice
but
lacks
character
o
very
nice
if
unremarkable
beer
good
with
food
i
like
that
it
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
bitter
than
expected
extremely
clean
and
crisp
tasting
if
this
is
a
marzen
though
what
is
stiegl
marzen
this
beer
has
marzen
like
qualities
but
im
a
little
confused
by
it
all
theres
rich
vienna
like
malt
in
their
with
a
toffee
carapils
like
taste
which
is
cleaned
up
by
an
extremely
mild
hop
presence
a
very
malty
beer
and
does
taste
like
a
very
rich
oktoberfest
just
without
a
deeper
hue
simple
but
pretty
well
brewed
nothing
to
complain
about
and
has
a
bit
of
an
edge
on
some
other
brews
its
year
round
though
so
you
oktoberfest
lovers
should
get
all
over
this
one
clean
smooth
and
balanced
pretty
good
o
not
a
bad
marzen
there
are
better
out
there
this
one
is
just
above
average
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
malt
grass
and
slight
skunk
taste
is
of
grain
malt
and
some
herbal
and
grassy
hop
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
and
nothing
all
that
special
in
my
opinion
o
very
easy
to
slug
down
but
hardly
any
form
of
märzen
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
german
pils
and
bavarian
helles
the
good
breadiness
is
delicious
up
front
with
the
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
makes
you
think
pils
but
either
way
this
is
a
pretty
satisfying
beer
for
an
afterworker
sadly
the
overall
impression
is
that
this
really
isnt
all
that
good
ive
had
this
on
tap
in
salzburg
and
it
was
excellent
but
i
guess
being
so
far
from
the
source
has
left
this
beer
underwhelming
pours
transparent
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
aroma
is
strongly
of
golden
delicious
apple
peel
and
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
golden
delicious
apple
and
honey
yet
somehow
without
the
merits
that
either
would
have
on
its
own
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
something
i
would
gravitate
toward
if
given
better
options
the
bar
menu
touted
that
goldbrau
was
regarded
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
by
many
beer
connoisseurs
but
i
cant
fathom
how
that
is
even
remotely
true
to
any
extent
not
offensive
but
certainly
not
something
that
i
would
ask
for
again
overall
a
very
good
munich
helles
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
lightmedium
bodied
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
worth
a
shot
prost
o
the
lighter
carbonation
and
lack
of
maltiness
would
make
this
a
good
beer
to
have
when
youre
planning
on
having
a
few
overall
id
normally
rather
have
one
heavier
ale
than
a
few
lagers
but
received
in
my
beer
of
the
month
sixpack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
va
poured
from
a
half
liter
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
larger
head
which
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
smell
of
malt
lightly
but
not
much
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
that
have
a
great
taste
better
than
most
import
lagers
carbonation
is
correct
and
beer
goes
down
well
definitely
one
you
could
drink
down
all
night
a
nice
lager
overall
the
lasting
qualities
on
the
palate
are
quite
short
and
there
really
isnt
any
complexity
but
i
dont
think
there
is
supposed
to
be
for
the
style
really
the
effervescence
just
doesnt
quit
i
like
it
a
lot
for
what
it
is
i
think
everything
is
balanced
pretty
well
and
nothing
sticks
out
as
offensive
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
hardly
any
head
and
no
lacing
it
is
much
darker
than
most
macrolagers
the
smell
is
really
nice
has
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
unlike
most
lagers
it
is
very
inviting
from
the
look
and
smell
of
it
taste
is
average
at
best
the
look
and
smell
had
me
really
looking
forward
to
something
special
but
the
taste
is
just
ok
for
a
munich
helles
it
definitely
doesnt
have
as
much
of
a
defined
maltiness
in
the
taste
department
like
one
would
expect
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
empty
overall
the
beer
is
average
i
believe
this
is
my
first
austrian
beer
and
it
leads
me
to
think
that
the
austrians
should
leave
the
beer
to
the
neighbors
the
germans
overall
the
aroma
was
nice
most
of
these
helles
lagers
are
just
less
bitter
light
lagers
for
me
nothing
too
special
about
this
one
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
medium
bodied
feel
overall
i
enjoy
my
helles
lagers
more
than
most
id
say
and
stiegl
is
another
fine
example
from
the
old
world
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bavarian
lodge
had
to
have
something
from
a
germanspeaking
country
to
go
with
my
schweins
haxn
described
as
a
golden
the
beer
had
an
earthier
quality
than
most
hellesstyles
beers
ive
tried
definitely
malty
it
also
had
a
sweet
quality
not
as
clear
a
taste
as
other
beers
of
this
style
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
for
the
moment
o
pretty
good
brew
maybe
not
worth
the
3
99
i
payed
for
it
but
certainly
much
better
than
many
other
macro
brewed
lagers
from
europe
overall
this
is
a
no
frills
euro
lager
with
no
bite
light
and
smooth
feel
and
fundamental
beer
flavors
a
nice
little
find
here
an
obvious
choice
brew
for
the
warmer
months
overall
given
time
for
the
skunkiness
to
blow
into
the
next
room
we
were
left
with
a
general
at
best
generic
european
lager
aftertaste
is
like
a
mouthful
of
dimes
great
beer
all
around
everything
expected
for
the
style
and
the
abv
poured
a
nice
2
finger
huge
white
head
straw
golden
with
lots
of
carbonation
smell
very
grassy
little
sweetness
to
it
definitely
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
summer
day
laying
by
the
pool
have
recommended
this
beer
to
many
of
my
customers
who
are
looking
for
something
simple
not
crazy
and
have
yet
to
hear
a
complaint

this

good

to

i
know
nothing
about
this

but
it
gives
the
impression
of
being
a
good
macro
not
phenomenal

still
i

have
another

this

as
a

im
no
expert
but
im
about
90
sure
this
is
not
the
correct
style
designation
for
this
beer
this
is
a
golden
lager
ok
whatever
they
say
here
but
im
not
going
to
review
this
as
a
fest
beer
since
it
is
clearly
not
the
color
is
spot
on
golden
thick
head
that
dies
quickly
nice
foamy
lacing
basic
good
clean
beer
smells
barley
grain
light
hops
some
sweetness
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
bright
clean
and
rich
mellow
grass
rich
grain
sweet
mild
hops
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
very
sturdy
yet
refreshing
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
d
very
very
drinkable
i
like
it
much
better
than
most
if
not
all
brews
coined
märzenoktoberfest
d
cant
get
more
drinkable
than
a
beer
like
stiegl
drinkability
very
good
beer
but
i
think
this
was
an
old
sample
overall
an
enjoyable
lager
more
of
a
pils
than
anything
else
however
a
bit
more
body
and
sweetness
than
their
standard
pils
i
see
this
brew
as
just
another
example
of
that
style
more
or
less
a
touch
of
corn
syrup
perhaps
yet
no
caramel
and
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
though
a
bit
less
refined
overall
more
euro
pale
in
style
than
anything
else
i
have
had
this
beer
both
on
tap
and
in
a
16oz
bottle
it
is
a
remarkable
beer
in
either
form
i
seek
it
out
i
dont
think
i
have
a
single
negative
comment
about
this
beer
to
my
palate
it
is
perfect
in
every
way
it
pours
a
pure
bright
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
primarily
of
yeast
it
reminds
me
of
making
bread
the
subtle
burn
you
feel
if
you
bring
your
nose
close
to
the
bowl
of
yeast
and
sugar
and
water
there
is
some
of
that
in
the
flavor
as
well
there
is
some
hop
but
its
bitterness
is
negated
by
the
malt
and
yeast
the
malt
flavor
is
not
detectable
per
se
it
is
felt
in
the
soft
texture
of
the
beer
and
it
counters
the
bitterness
of
hops
yeast
is
the
dominant
flavor
breadiness
mouthfeel
is
superior
it
feels
smooth
and
wet
there
is
not
a
hint
of
chalkiness
or
dryness
to
be
found
here
like
a
loaf
of
bread
this
beer
can
become
heavy
if
one
overindulges
that
said
it
is
highly
drinkable
if
your
intent
is
to
savor
its
impeccable
flavor
if
you
like
me
love
lagers
this
is
a
beer
you
should
seek
out
there
is
nothing
revolutionary
about
it
german
purity
law
etc
but
it
is
so
perfectly
executed
that
i
simply
cannot
imagine
a
better
more
satisfying
beer
incidentally
my
bottle
says
quote
a
wonderful
refreshing
salzburg
lager
beer
speciality
which
would
support
my
claim
that
is
definitely
not
an
marzenoktoberfest
style
beer
and
is
much
closer
to
a
lager
for
me
this
is
somewhere
between
a
pilsner
and
a
lager
the
sweetness
of
a
pilsner
without
the
bite
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
minimum
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
but
never
really
disappears
smells
of
yeast
water
and
citrusy
hops
tastes
sweet
and
malty
and
of
noble
hops
finishes
a
little
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
fizzy
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
it
again
i
like
this
the
timing
is
odd
but
make
no
qualms
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
when
i
picked
it
up
not
a
bad
drinker
though
definitely
nothing
special
its
quite
a
bit
lighter
than
any
oktoberfest
ive
tried
but
im
not
familiar
enough
with
the
style
to
say
if
its
offstyle
or
not
if
someone
offered
me
a
stiegl
i
would
happily
accept
but
dont
think
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
very
sessionable
if
youre
into
it
drinkability
picked
this
up
for
1
99
for
a
5l
bottle
a
good
sessionable
beer
the
beer
almost
captures
a
caramel
bready
note
that
reminds
me
of
oktoberfests
but
not
enough
to
overly
state
itself
but
the
hop
character
and
dry
finish
favor
the
german
lagers
a
nice
beer
that
is
both
highly
drinkable
and
characterful
draft
at
haus
staudt
clear
and
golden
with
a
lively
head
thats
fed
by
a
steady
stream
of
champagnelike
bubbles
clean
and
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
hay
and
leafy
hops
a
touch
soapy
at
colder
temperatures
cleaner
and
sweeter
as
it
warms
flavors
of
lime
zest
and
hay
are
prevalent
on
the
palate
supported
by
herbal
and
slightly
earthy
hops
and
pale
malt
clean
lightbodied
and
balanced
almost
to
a
fault
this
is
a
wellcrafted
easy
drinker
thats
lacking
a
bit
in
character
finishes
dry
and
mildly
bitter
im
impressed
by
how
clean
this
is
very
solid
stuff
feels
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
like
for
a
marzen
but
its
exceptionally
drinkable
would
gladly
have
again
at
the
right
price
point
a
couple
of
sips
and
it
is
time
to
move
on
this
may
be
the
style
but
it
does
not
hold
interest
mouthdrink
light
feel
watery
taste
gives
this
superior
drinkability
d
overall
a
forgetable
beer
to
be
reached
for
as
a
last
resort
i
wrote
this
beer
off
a
long
time
ago
but
came
back
to
it
based
on
the
positive
reviews
here
im
sorry
to
say
that
it
still
disappoints
on
most
levels
and
its
best
to
steer
clear
of
it
when
there
are
so
many
better
märzens
available
in
austria
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
if
i
could
get
them
at
this
price
regularly
id
probably
have
some
in
the
fridge
on
most
occasions
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
however
i
would
not
buy
it
again
its
not
really
my
thing
it
is
quite
similar
to
the
prevalent
lowest
common
denominator
beers
here
especially
in
appearance
and
smell
but
its
a
much
more
enjoyable
drinking
experience
overall
outstanding
beer
id
highly
suggest
it
to
any
of
my
friends
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
i
have
had
better
but
it
was
still
good
edit
after
having
a
fresher
bottle
im
sure
im
getting
a
lot
more
good
direct
hop
flavours
clean
and
very
tasty
upping
the
taste
and
overall
score
appropriately
d
quite
its
not
bitter
and
the
taste
and
feel
leaves
me
wanting
another
can
in
the
future
had
this
beer
multiple
times
on
tap
on
a
visit
to
salzburg
it
was
a
wonderful
accompaniment
to
my
typical
meals
of
sausage
kraut
it
balanced
those
flavors
perfectly
with
a
light
sweetness
that
came
out
against
the
sour
and
salty
flavors
of
the
food
it
has
been
brewed
in
salzburg
for
hundreds
of
years
mozart
drank
it
wish
i
could
get
it
stateside
served
in
the
special

at
brussels
in

smooth

good
refreshment
value
medium

low

malty

tastes
pretty
good
drinks
like
a
lager
with
a
bit
more
finesse
slow
steady
carbonation
had
staying
power
head
regenerated
quite
well
with
a
swirl
even
to
the
last
inch
of
beer
recommended
a
simple
lighter
and
tasty
marzen
i
guess
its
yearround
why
not
i
think
i
could
really
get
used
to
a
beer
like
this
this
is
a
nice
tasting
and
easily
consumed
brew
a
decent
enough
warmweather
drinker
especially
coming
from
a
can
and
a
bit
light
for
the
winter
is
coming
style
its
been
assigned
here
so
i
say
drink
it
now
and
prost
now
where
did
i
put
my
second
serving
of
spicy
sausage
drinkability
nothing
special
but
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
try
if
anyone
here
is
a
bottle
cap
collector
these
bottles
at
least
by
the
time
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
and
maybe
it
wasnt
the
only
one
had
all
different
caps
european
flags
to
be
more
precise
i
found
em
to
be
a
good
addition
stiegl
goldbräu
pours
a
big
stiff
head
over
a
clear
dark
yellow
brew
carbonation
is
extremely
active
and
the
nose
is
clean
light
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
light
slightly
sweet
malt
and
a
mild
herbal
hop
off
the
back
mouthfeel
is
likewise
light
and
crisp
a
very
basic
lager
but
pretty
refreshing
and
a
good
choice
for
sessions
if
the
big
american
macro
brewers
could
transition
their
lameass
lagers
to
even
something
as
simple
as
this
they
could
all
hold
their
heads
a
little
higher
taste
maltiness
and
skunkiness
make
up
the
majority
of
the
taste
light
bitterness
rounds
out
the
finish
overall
its
not
that
bad
better
than
heineken
anyways
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
maerzen
style
beer
seems
more
like
a
helles
lager
to
me
full
and
not
too
slick
carbonation
is
not
too
aggressive
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
refreshingly
quaffable
lager
but
i
would
say
definitely
not
a
marzen
more
like
a
pils
overall
quite
average
lager
nothing
special
my
pour
resulted
in
a
nice
thick
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
the
nose
had
a
classic
lager
sweetness
kind
of
grainy
but
definitely
a
lager
the
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
somewhat
bitter
sharpness
5
liters
was
plenty
sour
corn
mash
taste
with
some
hop
bitterness
bland
malts
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
very
foul
aftertaste
not
worth
repeating
just
another
generic
euro
lager
no
different
than
any
of
the
other
dozen
on
the
shelf
d
overall
i
suppose
this
is
a
decent
austrian
golden
lager
not
really
a
märzen
the
strong
malt
character
is
quite
typical
of
an
austrian
beer
from
my
experience
that
said
its
a
pretty
ordinary
example
of
those
beers
and
nothing
quite
special
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
isnt
really
as
oktoberfesty
as
ive
had
even
though
its
classified
as
a
marzenoktoberfest
not
the
best
beer
you
will
ever
find
but
you
could
do
a
whole
lot
worse
this
beer
is
like
a
mix
of
simple
euro
lager
and
malty
german
lager
refreshing
with
some
flavor
to
be
had
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
it
had
a
small
white
head
that
disappered
quick
it
poured
a
very
light
golden
color
while
the
beer
was
sitting
on
the
table
i
looked
down
at
it
the
bottom
of
the
glass
was
almost
clear
as
water
took
the
first
sip
and
it
was
very
mild
almost
creamy
i
could
also
feel
the
carbonation
on
my
tounge
it
wasnt
intense
it
was
actually
quite
a
nice
feel
this
is
definatly
a
beer
worth
trying
the
taste
is
fullbodied
and
aromatic
in
the
mouth
with
a
strong
notes
of
grain
herbs
honey
and
flowers
it
has
a
light
bitterness
and
a
wonderful
finish
of
sweet
fruity
grain
and
grassy
bitterness
it
also
has
a
slightly
unusual
quality
that
is
hard
to
describe
and
is
rather
oily
its
refreshing
and
smooth
but
wonderfully
tasty
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
others
in
the
area
this
lighter
austrian
brew
comes
with
a
decent
level
of
complex
flavor
its
a
style
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
although
it
does
have
a
slight
heavier
edge
that
might
turn
some
people
off
to
it
but
for
me
it
works
ive
never
appreciated
anything
that
slightly
resembles
the
mass
produced
american
junk
so
this
keeps
itself
away
from
that
category
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
pale
golden
color
white
one
finger
head
that
sustains
for
a
little
bit
mild
fruity
malt
aroma
mixed
with
dry
grains
and
a
slight
honey
sweetness
drying
bitter
hops
is
more
assertive
in
the
taste
and
faint
notes
of
lightly
toasted
grains
citrus
and
mild
fruity
malt
on
the
down
side
is
a
stale
breadiness
and
a
blanketed
rice
like
blandness
the
finish
isnt
something
i
care
to
revisit
with
cereal
grains
some
floral
hops
and
a
cheap
white
wine
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
descent
and
carbonation
is
moderate
a
little
too
fizzy
with
micro
foam
all
in
all
this
just
passes
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
drinkability
it
has
a
pucker
factor
that
i
do
not
like
but
as
it
sit
and
gets
flat
oddly
it
gets
better
i
hate
admitting
that
drinkability
was
poor
i
just
couldnt
finish
it
it
was
so
unrefreshing
and
uninteresting
even
a
flavor
defect
like
skunkiness
would
have
made
it
more
interesting
and
maybe
more
palatable
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
sporadic
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
pint
glass
a
good
dose
of
malt
in
the
nose
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
more
carbonation
as
it
is
rather
flat
and
watery
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
for
what
it
is
however
i
dont
believe
i
will
purchase
again
because
there
are
so
many
better
brews
within
the
style
mouthfeel
is
a
downer
as
watery
and
fizzy
are
the
descriptors
that
continue
to
pop
into
my
head
there
is
an
oiliness
to
the
finish
that
while
usually
a
detractor
is
actually
welcome
for
its
thickening
quality
here
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
is
all
ive
got
tonight
on
this
evening
when
my
fellow
chicago
bas
are
enjoying
the
2007
german
beerhall
crawl
yes
i
know
this
is
austrian
with
out
me
i
could
have
a
few
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
in
austria
as
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
few
light
and
effervescent
without
being
watery
or
fizzy
this
is
a
warm
weather
quaffer
not
complicated
but
subtle
i
rated
this
as
a
helles
lager
because
im
sure
it
is
not
a
marzen
tastes
good
like
some
european
macro
but
not
in
a
bad
way
a
nice
froth
on
the
palate
sweetens
up
the
brew
nicely
sessionable
and
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
have
been
fortunate
to
get
many
austrian
beers
over
the
years
and
this
one
is
middle
of
the
road
decent
would
drink
again
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
notes
this
is
simply
bad
no
good
way
to
sugar
coat
this
offering
the
flavour
continued
where
the
aroma
left
off
but
with
a
bit
more
complexity
joining
the
grassy
hop
taste
were
some
spicy
bitter
hop
notes
and
a
bit
more
of
a
roasted
flavour
from
the
malt
pleasant
medium
body
and
carbonation
on
the
high
side
it
finished
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
maybe
because
ive
been
away
from
hops
for
a
few
weeks
but
i
really
liked
this
it
was
nothing
special
but
it
did
the
job
it
was
designed
for
my
thirst
was
quenched
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
therefore
a
good
session
beer
there
beer
also
tasted
better
as
i
drank
more
also
a
good
session
beer
quality
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
wished
i
had
another
a
premium
commercial
allmalt
german
golden
lager
certainly
not
a
marzen
as
this
page
suggests
and
a
great
session
lager
better
than
most
canadian
national
lagers
and
superior
to
many
weak
micro
pils
in
a
pinch
some
of
us
here
have
been
blending
this
beer
5050
with
kostritzer
schwarzbier
for
a
great
black
and
tan
session
lager
drinkability
a
fine
session
beer
more
of
a
warm
weather
pick
for
me
but
on
the
pricey
side
2
59
per
17
ounce
bottle
taste
is
mostly
malt
more
roasted
taste
than
i
was
expecting
good
aroma
hop
presence
slight
lemony
sourness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
certainly
not
overcarbonated
even
though
the
beer
itself
looks
like
it
might
be
goes
down
very
easily
with
a
malty
aftertaste
this
is
a
quality
lager
and
one
i
could
stock
in
my
fridge
easily
for
all
those
world
cup
matches
coming
up
12oz
bottle
pours
out
a
golden
yellow
with
next
to
nothing
for
a
head
it
was
highly
carbonated
tons
of
bubbles
the
smell
was
a
little
bitter
the
taste
however
was
not
it
was
crisp
and
smooth
it
was
very
drinkable
it
is
very
typical
of
many
european
lagers
d
not
bad
by
any
stretch
i
recall
having
one
of
these
while
backpacking
through
austria
had
it
warm
out
of
the
can
and
wasnt
particularly
bothered
by
it
not
a
great
brew
but
not
bad
either
extra
5
pt
for
nostalgiap
this
is
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
very
sessionable
offering
from
our
austrian
friends
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
slightly
fruity
and
very
pleasant
taste
is
malty
with
some
fruit
overtones
and
some
hop
bitterness
as
well
feels
a
little
thin
but
is
well
carbonated
and
is
easy
to
drink
a
fairly
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
very
flavorful
helles
i
recommend
it
while
not
a
great
beer
quite
good
for
running

fifty

over
this

recently

poured
a
rather
pale
gold
very
little
head
aroma
was
sweet
and
a
bit
grassy
bright
malt
a
touch
on
the
acidic
side
hops
were
typically
bavarian
finished
clean
without
astringency
overall
a
pleasant
german
lager
fairly
average
for
style
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
nothing
here
to
rise
above
the
pack
pours
a
clear
orangishgold
and
a
2
5
finger
white
head
with
good
contour
and
solid
retention
leaving
quite
respectable
lacing
the
nose
is
mild
but
features
a
good
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
slightly
metallic
hops
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
fairly
heavy
while
malt
is
present
in
the
taste
hops
determine
the
flavor
profile
from
the
start
a
bit
metallic
and
a
touch
harsh
the
bitterness
doesnt
last
long
but
is
pronounced
the
finish
is
sweeter
as
the
malt
makes
a
comeback
leaving
a
bready
aftertaste
clear
golden
beer
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
nice
fluffy
white

aroma

musty

little

nothing
offensive
or
extraodinary
in
the
taste
malt
followed
through
hoppy
finish
crisp
and
soft
this
one
doesnt
have
any
strikes
against
it
but
it
sure
didnt
excite
me
metallic
tasting
lager
although
some
creaminess
though
like
a
nitrotap
medium
mouthfeel
passable
above
molson
and
even
some
watery
micros
but
not
really
a
good
beer
not
bad
for
the
beer
store
and
its
thin
selection
pale
gold
on
the
refreshing
side
thx
the
flavour
is
more
akin
to
a
weak
marzen
style
or
a
malty
pils
im
not
sure
where
this
beer
is
trying
to
go
sweet
malt
up
front
but
the
metallic
grains
take
centre
stage
closer
to
the
middle
very
crisp
mouthfeel
there
and
they
linger
on
and
blend
in
with
the
hops
upon
the
finish
a
dry
crisp
finish
it
makes
for
a
fairly
decent
pils
but
nothing
overwhelmingly
special
aside
from
a
very
impressive
appearance
especially
the
head
which
left
thick
webs
of
lacing
and
a
pinky
finger
cap
of
white
foam
all
the
way
down
the
glass
amazing
retention
worth
checking
out
if
only
for
the
scoobydoo
mystery
of
which
style
it
really
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
have
had
better
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
malty
aroma
with
a
breadlike
quality
the
taste
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
that
breadlike
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
very
smooth
this
is
a
fine
lager
it
has
good
flavor
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
a
good
drinker
this
could
make
a
good
summer
session
brew
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
blending
some
may
find
it
lacks
but
i
find
it
good
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
thanks
to
the
carbonation
this
brewery
makes
outstanding
products
unfortunately
this
isnt
one
of
them
very
good
taste
not
too
bitter
not
much
hop
easy
to
drink
cool
it
well
not
too
expensive
no
dosserbeer
though
overall
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
traditional
and
easy
to
drink
o
to
me
there
is
only
so
much
one
can
do
with
this
style
heavy
seas
has
done
a
good
job
it
could
be
more
robust
with
spices
yet
it
settles
as
an
easy
drinker
that
easily
trumps
the
samuel
adams
i
see
on
grocery
store
shelves
o
solid
seems
great
for
those
first
fall
nights
when
it
starts
cooling
down
o
ok
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
marzen
not
enough
caramel
richness
and
too
much
orange
candy
make
this
a
miss
on
the
style
its
also
a
bit
too
carbonated
making
each
quaff
a
mouthful
of
foam
the
level
of
toasting
of
the
malts
is
ok
but
while
the
structure
is
integrated
the
components
themselves
are
mismatched
unless
heavy
seas
adjusts
the
recipe
in
the
future
this
is
a
pass
when
putting
together
a
marzen
oktoberfest
tasting
unless
you
want
to
start
with
something
too
sweet
to
demonstrate
how
the
style
can
go
astray
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
head
there
is
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
wheat
lemon
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
great
here
not
watery
and
lots
of
carbonation
that
just
gives
that
satisfying
feel
taste
is
almost
pineapple
on
the
front
and
spicy
hops
and
a
faint
roasted
taste
on
the
finish
neither
taste
is
particularly
overwhelming
if
anything
the
front
end
might
be
a
little
stronger
than
the
finish
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
theres
a
very
minor
hop
but
the
malt
is
the
profile
not
unlike
a
marzen
o
an
enjoyable
beer
simple
only
my
2nd
marzen
so
im
not
sure
if
i
have
a
real
feel
for
the
style
overall
not
bad
im
impressed
that
its
not
just
all
caramel
malts
and
no
lager
flavors
like
most
american
attempts
at
a
marzen
nice
lager
flavors
soft
just
a
bit
of
caramel
to
beef
it
up
a
touch
more
hops
and
carbonation
would
have
bumped
it
up
a
bit
i
enjoyed
this
maerzen
good
solid
beer
o
what
is
this
national
mediocre
beer
month
i
feel
like
ive
given
more
2
7s
these
past
few
days
than
a
junior
high
tricounty
gymnastics
meet
there
just
isnt
much
to
this
and
it
doesnt
have
the
drinkability
to
compensate
not
a
beer
to
be
avoided
but
one
you
should
think
long
and
hard
about
before
dropping
a
hamilton
on
overall
plain
which
is
the
problem
with
many
in
this
genre
drinkable
but
not
memorable
this
brew
pours
a
clear
bold
gold
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
toffee
and
sweet
malt
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
clipper
city
heavy
seas
marzen
is
a
decent
beer
recommended
odnot
a
high
point
for
a
style
i
dont
care
for
very
much
this
was
very
disappointing
all
around
the
mouthfeel
was
by
far
the
worst
part
but
the
flavor
had
its
off
notes
too
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
o
i
am
a
heavy
seas
fan
and
will
drink
the
beer
again
this
said
if
there
is
a
choice
of
another
marzen
like
ayinger
spatan
etc
i
would
not
choose
the
heavy
seas
version
o
this
beer
doesnt
scream
marzen
to
me
i
would
probably
guess
vienna
lager
before
marzen
however
it
has
awesome
lager
fermentation
and
really
showcases
nice
clean
malt
characteristics
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
lagers
that
makes
it
to
ct
overall
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
again
because
there
are
much
better
versions
of
the
style
available
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
clear
orange
with
a
thin
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
and
noble
hops
some
sour
notes
probably
the
bottle
was
old
medium
smooth
body
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
balance
noble
hops
on
the
palate
some
sour
barnyard
notes
make
this
beer
hard
to
drink
there
is
best
by
date
on
the
label
but
its
not
marked
i
will
have
to
rerate
this
brew
if
i
get
it
fresh
drink
an
easy
drink
with
very
mild
flavor
neither
malts
nor
hops
stand
out
so
a
decent
choice
if
youre
look
for
a
dry
marzen
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
it
was
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
not
overwhelming
in
any
regard
d
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
decent
take
on
the
style
o
very
bland
and
underwhelming
i
came
in
with
low
expectations
on
this
and
they
were
barely
met
inoffensive
but
macroish
and
not
one
of
heavy
seas
better
brews
o
above
average
but
nothing
special
i
liked
the
harpoon
better
solid
looking
marzen
its
got
a
nice
clarity
on
the
orangered
body
and
ample
carbonation
aroma
is
pretty
good
its
a
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
is
very
good
its
a
nice
marzen
that
doesnt
get
sugarsweet
as
many
american
takes
on
the
style
can
be
fruit
aspects
keep
things
interesting
dont
get
me
wrong
its
sweet
but
with
the
right
restraint
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
wellcarbed
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
great
marzen
overall
i
gave
this
marzan
a
3
5
because
it
was
alot
lighter
than
the
same
style
beer
that
i
am
used
to
despite
this
however
this
beer
was
actually
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
maybe
if
the
changed
the
name
from
marzan
to
toasted
lager
or
something
id
give
it
a
very
good
rating
but
as
it
stands
this
beer
is
just
pretty
good
onice
beer
very
straight
forward
and
has
great
malt
flavor
cheers
overall
a
german
fest
beer
with
the
typical
high
standard
of
ccheavy
seas
an
easy
drinking
lager
could
imagine
drinking
multiples
of
this
one
this
beer
in
a
bottle
is
served
well
pours
nice
into
glass
the
appearance
is
light
amber
and
sits
will
in
a
mug
very
nice
to
the
nose
the
mouth
feel
is
great
no
hanging
around
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
taste
is
well
worth
it
this
beer
is
very
served
well
with
a
good
pizza
overall
we
like
this
beer
well
played
a
good
beer
thats
worthy
of
more
although
nothing
really
stands
out
mo
very
crisp
and
drinkable
while
maintaining
a
nice
weight
to
it
i
like
its
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
was
very
surprised
how
good
this
beer
was
and
would
get
it
again
overall
it
feels
like
marzen
light
but
it
is
a
tolerable
drink
but
definitely
has
a
banana
angle
sense
to
it
o
there
are
so
many
better
ones
out
there
for
style
id
pass
on
this
one
quite
often
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
drinkability
theres
better
options
in
this
category
but
would
be
nice
at
parties
for
none
bas
o
a
light
and
crisp
beer
drinks
like
a
summer
beer
but
has
some
body
to
it
to
keep
you
warm
as
the
summer
months
change
to
fall
overall
for
me
outside
of
the
caramel
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
here
this
made
for
a
beer
that
was
drinkable
and
decent
but
not
spectacular
most
marzenoktoberfests
that
i
have
had
seem
to
be
a
little
deeper
in
flavor
than
this
one
o
a
solid
though
not
amazing
marzen
lager
it
has
an
alright
nose
but
the
flavor
has
nice
malt
richness
nut
and
a
bit
of
earth
the
mild
hops
help
balance
the
beer
sadly
even
in
maryland
the
price
is
much
to
high
8
99
the
better
german
marzens
and
oktoberfests
are
around
the
same
price
or
are
only
a
dollar
or
two
more
expensive
in
other
words
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
but
not
good
enough
to
be
compete
with
other
and
better
beers
still
it
is
one
of
the
few
marzens
that
is
available
all
year
round
this
is
a
very
tasty
fall
beer
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
taste
fruity
with
a
slight
buttered
toast
quality
finishes
sweet
very
little
bitterness
very
smooth
21
march
2013
bought
a
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixed
6pack
not
different
from
my
last
review
good
to
know
heavy
seas
is
keeping
up
the
good
work
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
overall
this
one
comes
off
a
bit
to
watery
compared
to
other
marzenoktoberfest
beers
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
the
flavor
of
the
beer
formerly
know
as
marzhon
haha
is
good
with
a
mild
caramel
malt
sweetness
up
front
and
mild
toasted
note
with
a
slight
nuttiness
and
gentle
dried
fruit
sweet
edge
which
seems
to
be
yeast
derived
there
is
a
little
spice
from
the
hops
on
the
back
end
but
a
relatively
clean
yeast
flavor
with
subtle
tinge
of
apple
verdict
on
this
is
a
beer
i
could
deal
with
frequently
a
decent
american
take
on
the
marzen
style
that
doesnt
strictly
conform
but
i
appreciate
that
i
recommend
this
for
those
who
like
lagers
with
malt
emphasis
and
arent
sticklers
for
the
traditional
cheers
pretty
average
but
easy
to
drink
6
good
gateway
beer
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
buy
a
6
pack
for
a
day
a
drinking
o
a
subpar
take
on
one
of
my
most
reviled
styles
seriously
does
anyone
make
a
good
marzen
pass
drinkability
for
a
märzenstyle
offered
yearround
this
one
has
it
for
the
style
and
for
the
yearround
drinkability
mellow
but
with
character
decent
abv
for
the
style
and
with
just
enought
harvest
attributes
that
it
makes
me
long
for
the
fall
d
very
high
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
given
the
ratings
this
gets
it
far
surpassed
my
expectations
i
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
heavy
seas
mix
pack
and
was
not
disappointed
what
so
ever
overall
it
doesnt
even
begin
compare
with
most
imported
marzens
an
average
forgetable
beer
overall
i
one
of
the
easiest
drinkers
i
have
seen
and
something
that
just
really
grabbed
a
hold
and
would
not
expect
it
to
very
refreshing
and
light
but
with
enough
flavor
and
spice
to
keep
your
interest
this
beer
pours
out
copper
colored
and
with
little
head
very
little
carbonation
which
is
not
correct
to
style
should
be
moderate
smells
of
grassy
grain
and
some
grassy
hops
but
overall
very
clean
tastes
of
medicinal
tettnanger
or
liberty
hops
up
front
with
sweet
munich
malts
and
grassy
malts
in
the
back
very
hop
assertive
for
a
marzen
and
i
like
that
mouthfeel
is
wet
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
pleasant
hop
dryness
in
the
back
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
marzens
are
supposed
to
be
prost
overall
nice
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
overall
meh
wasnt
overly
impressed
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
some
easy
to
drink
no
flair
overall
overall
the
beer
has
a
great
initial
aroma
but
the
flavor
while
it
does
follow
the
aroma
moved
into
an
unpleasant
bitter
flavor
towards
the
end
id
definitely
like
to
try
this
beer
again
because
it
seems
like
it
has
some
potential
and
i
might
have
had
a
bad
bottle
overall
its
pretty
good
albeit
not
quite
world
class
but
a
very
nice
offering
that
id
be
very
happy
to
drink
again
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
marzen
beers
sam
adams
being
my
favorite
beer
wouldnt
buy
this
by
itself
but
was
ok
in
a
variety
pack
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
it
was
decent
but
average
easy
to
drink
though
overall
was
not
impressed
average
beer
that
i
will
pass
on
in
the
future
heavy
seas
märzen
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
lager
with
a
very
thin
mottled
white
head
that
leaves
outstanding
lacing
it
has
a
tangy
malt
aroma
thats
a
little
funky
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
lively
the
slightly
sticky
finish
leaves
mouth
slightly
chalky
it
tastes
like
the
aroma
malty
and
a
little
funky
there
are
some
melanoids
and
a
note
of
black
pepper
this
isnt
really
my
thing
but
there
are
no
faults
i
usually
lover
the
oktoberfest
style
brews
and
i
look
forward
to
oktoberfest
every
yearbut
this
somewhat
lacks
can
do
much
better
maybe
this
style
should
be
left
to
the
germans
d
hate
to
say
it
but
this
one
struck
me
as
subpar
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
and
though
not
actively
bad
the
low
carbonation
made
it
hard
to
get
through
the
pint
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
may
2011
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
goldamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
bready
and
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuts
the
aroma
is
also
on
the
weak
side
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
i
cant
pick
up
any
other
flavors
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
its
certainly
not
hard
to
drink
i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
its
not
one
of
the
better
heavy
seas
brews
ive
tried
but
with
that
being
said
its
not
bad
and
i
would
try
this
again
in
the
future
all
around
not
the
best
option
from
heavy
seas
but
something
that
everyone
can
enjoy
and
a
nice
session
beer
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
overall
its
a
fine
beer
but
ill
probably
not
have
this
one
again
im
proud
of
this
md
brew
its
quite
original
and
not
one
of
those
american
a
craft
brew
trying
to
show
off
and
get
way
out
of
balance
on
hops
or
chocolate
or
blending
20
types
of
hops
and
such
sticking
to
traditional
style
for
a
marzen
and
delivering
very
well
d
very
high
and
a
friendly
beer
a
good
suggestion
for
cold
nights
near
a
fire
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
grains
some
hops
and
maltsalmost
pilsener
like
in
its
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
marzens
i
have
had
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
deep
rich
and
complex
marzens
out
there
and
easily
attainable
in
the
season
d
a
great
marzen
when
you
base
it
solely
on
taste
and
mouth
feel
wonderfully
sessionable
and
from
a
local
brewery
that
has
a
lot
of
history
i
just
wish
the
appearance
and
smell
had
more
to
offer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
all
spring
and
summer
long
even
though
its
an
october
fest
beer
pours
a
nice
and
light
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
a
foam
head
not
much
for
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
light
grains
power
the
scent
of
this
beer
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
with
some
dryness
but
its
done
fairly
well
some
toasty
malt
flavor
shows
through
as
well
carbonation
is
great
for
this
style
but
still
not
one
of
my
favorites
got
this
in
a
mix
pack
of
brews
from
clipper
city
brewing
company
my
least
favorite
brew
in
the
set
but
still
a
respectable
marzen
very
nice
body
to
this
quite
a
fan
of
this
makes
a
nice
change
from
hop
bombs
definitely
if
i
get
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
i
will
definitely
extremely
drinkable
this
is
just
what
a
good
märzen
should
be
very
balanced
equally
tasty
and
gorgeous
though
head
retention
is
definitely
lacking
its
certainly
understandable
how
this
has
won
so
many
awards
most
definitely
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
bright
gold
with
a
thin
head
bready
aroma
smooth
and
even
up
front
with
a
tangy
and
slightly
bitter
finish
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
excellent
representation
of
the
style
i
miss
the
old
name
though
okay
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
pours
a
faint
amber
with
onefinger
white
head
average
lacing
and
retention
not
much
of
a
nose
hints
of
sweet
caramel
bread
and
fruit
light
crisp
flavor
sweet
bread
and
caramel
malt
to
start
ends
with
decent
kick
of
citrus
hops
and
some
grassy
and
grain
notes
again
very
light
flavor
profile
but
well
put
together
crisp
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
to
go
along
with
a
medium
body
this
is
a
nice
marzen
pretty
standard
but
definitely
enjoyable
deep
yellow
with
an
amber
hue
and
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
white
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
bready
toasted
malt
aromas
and
a
hint
of
lemon
medium
bodied
but
a
little
on
the
thicker
side
with
a
buttery
smooth
feel
the
carbonation
slowly
builds
and
rolls
over
in
your
mouth
biscuity
toasted
malt
flavors
with
a
bit
citrusy
tang
as
the
carbonation
bursts
finishes
smooth
and
clean
with
a
light
toasted
malt
aftertaste
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
very
smooth
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
like
how
the
flavors
layer
on
top
of
each
other
and
appear
one
after
the
other
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
makes
me
consider
clipper
a
peer
of
sam
adams
they
are
that
good
and
consistent
imo
they
need
more
credit
im
picking
up
a
case
for
thanksgiving
cant
imagine
that
any
novice
beer
critic
wouldnt
love
this
with
turkey
and
the
trimmings
d
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
its
just
a
bit
understated
in
my
estimation
some
marzens
seem
to
blur
the
line
between
a
rich
caramel
flavor
associated
with
most
of
the
current
ofests
and
more
of
a
bready
flavor
that
i
associate
with
more
of
a
maibock
this
is
one
of
those
beers
my
oldest
son
did
really
dig
the
logo
d
this
is
a
decent
marzen
that
puts
a
different
twist
on
the
style
well
crafted
just
wasnt
my
favorite
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfest
good
body
for
the
style
carbonation
is
fair
i
like
the
flavors
on
this
one
nice
sweet
carameltoffee
goodness
some
freshbaked
bread
and
finishes
with
just
a
twinge
of
alcohol
i
dont
know
why
but
i
have
really
been
enjoying
the
marzens
ive
tried
this
year
most
of
them
have
been
pretty
spot
on
for
my
liking
not
bad
at
all
i
could
have
a
sixer
of
this
in
my
fridge
any
time
of
the
year
part
of
the
heavy
seas
mixed
sampler
pack
this
was
the
only
nonextreme
option
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
not
much
head
to
it
seems
a
little
bit
flat
almost
nice
maltiness
to
the
aroma
some
slight
hops
taste
is
watery
medium
bodied
kind
of
a
boring
style
to
begin
with
and
clipper
city
doesnt
do
much
to
enhance
any
of
the
typical
marzen
tastes
drinkable
but
pretty
bland
and
boring
definitely
recommend
the
rest
of
their
line
up
though
i
actually
really
liked
this
beer
had
been
told
it
wasnt
that
great
but
after
tasting
for
myself
i
scoff
at
that
remark
no
its
not
the
best
of
its
kind
but
it
does
justice
letting
this
beer
warm
up
a
bit
is
what
really
brought
out
its
character
nice
caramel
flavor
and
a
little
toasted
note
very
good
paring
for
the
pizza
i
had
but
really
did
well
on
its
own
as
well
had
some
with
desert
as
well
and
it
did
just
fine
try
this
beer
a
bit
warmer
and
the
difference
is
shocking
in
a
good
way
notes
this
is
a
good
marzen
but
nothing
really
stands
out
every
thing
about
this
beer
is
average
too
fruity
to
be
a
lager
this
is
highly
drinkable
but
not
terribly
exciting
but
that
does
at
least
partially
meet
the
confines
of
the
style
so
worth
the
effort
if
you
can
find
it
and
feel
like
something
tasty
and
easy
in
the
second
half
of
september
i
found
this
drinkable
but
its
lack
of
oktoberfest
characteristics
necessitate
marks
down
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
lighter
amber
shade
with
a
thinner
but
well
retained
white
headaromas
consisted
mainly
of
toasty
maltand
caramelfaint
spicy
hops
but
again
they
are
faint
toasted
on
the
palate
along
with
sweetish
caramela
decent
aniselike
quality
comes
thru
as
wellthat
is
something
i
look
for
in
a
good
beer
of
the
stylehops
are
light
but
give
a
a
little
herbal
sharpness
in
the
finish
a
decent
shot
at
the
stylethere
are
many
that
are
not
as
good
coming
out
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
to
two
finger
head
which
resides
to
a
skim
and
gives
way
to
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
hints
of
biscuits
and
toast
the
taste
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
with
both
hints
of
toastiness
and
biscuits
there
is
also
a
very
slight
fruit
taste
and
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
there
is
nothing
to
ditract
from
drinking
it
but
it
lacks
a
little
something
it
is
an
easy
drink
though
a
solid
selection
but
not
best
in
class
pours
an
orangeish
golden
large
soapy
head
soon
dissipates
to
a
ring
very
few
trailers
smell
is
sweet
and
sort
of
perfumy
toasted
malt
a
bit
of
metallicness
taste
starts
off
bitter
and
never
really
delves
into
the
biscuitness
until
the
end
finishes
dry
and
slow
and
decent
good
drinkability
but
id
rather
have
another
marzen
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
head
but
sadly
not
a
trace
of
lacing
after
the
head
collapses
all
too
quickly
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
spicy
with
a
little
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
malty
and
smooth
with
cinnamon
and
a
little
hint
of
fall
leaves
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
little
prickly
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
although
its
not
quite
crisp
enough
to
be
in
the
top
tier
still
its
worth
a
shot
pours
a
clear
brownish
orange
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
malty
aromas
are
highly
subdued
but
the
maltiness
comes
through
loud
and
clear
on
the
palate
where
they
run
the
gamut
from
earthy
toasty
to
sweet
toffeeish
the
flavors
are
absolutely
delightful
the
body
could
use
a
little
more
heft
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
on
sale
at
my
local
store
for
7
99
with
a
free
tulip
pint
glass
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
could
drink
marzens
year
round
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramelized
malts
with
some
toasted
bread
a
little
earthy
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
has
some
toasted
bread
and
caramel
malt
flavors
upfront
earth
and
spicy
hops
and
a
little
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
fantastic
a
tasty
but
basic
marzen
probably
a
little
sweeter
than
most
german
versions
but
easy
drinking
nonetheless
poured
copperamber
with
ample
carbonation
into
a
sampling
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
average
lacing
not
much
in
the
nose
at
all
very
subtle
maltiness
and
herbal
hops
with
not
much
else
the
flavor
revealed
a
very
subdued
malt
presence
much
less
than
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
marzen
style
the
body
was
on
the
thin
side
and
very
highly
carbonated
unfortunately
not
a
big
fan
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
almost
no
head
that
quickly
diminishes
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
toasted
bready
malts
with
a
trace
of
hops
not
much
there
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
i
expected
not
that
im
complaining
but
its
not
fitting
to
the
style
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
as
well
the
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
which
was
certainly
fitting
of
the
style
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
id
likely
have
again
d
drinakability
is
decent
but
im
more
interested
in
an
overall
better
drinking
experience
ill
pass
next
time
drinkability
certainly
solid
enough
great
flavors
that
are
fitting
for
an
evening
drink
that
would
also
fare
a
little
better
in
the
early
spring
or
fall
months
does
feel
like
it
sits
a
tad
heavy
but
getting
through
one
or
two
would
certainly
be
easy
enough
drinks
pretty
easy
not
a
great
marzen
but
worth
a
few
before
moving
on
d
very
drinkable
would
work
well
with
burger
fries
steak
grilled
or
baked
chicken
or
most
anything
might
be
nice
with
some
fish
too
sweet
on
the
stomach
for
a
session
though
pours
a
light
orange
hue
with
plenty
of
head
which
fades
rather
quickly
leaving
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
this
beer
is
very
effervescent
aromas
of
malt
with
some
sweetness
and
the
classic
oktoberfest
scents
the
beer
is
crisp
and
the
carbonation
level
is
solid
while
simple
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
a
decent
beer
and
worth
trying
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
best
before
july
2010
notched
on
the
label
poured
a
translucent
burnt
orange
with
a
loose
half
inch
white
head
that
quickly
dispersed
into
a
soapy
skim
and
a
bubbly
band
around
the
edges
nose
was
very
subdued
and
lacking
the
big
malty
character
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
flavor
profile
reveals
light
fruity
esters
and
toasty
malts
but
very
weak
and
lacking
the
caramel
sweetness
finish
expresses
cereal
grains
and
the
skunky
quality
initially
suggested
by
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
even
background
carbonation
a
pretty
lackluster
marzen
unfortunate
because
ive
come
to
appreciate
the
quality
and
variety
from
this
brewery
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
had
some
nice
flavors
although
they
were
pretty
light
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
a
macro
and
comes
with
more
flavor
then
a
macro
but
it
wasnt
anything
id
buy
regularly
overall
not
my
favorite
of
clipper
citys
offerings
being
in
the
heavy
seas
box
id
hope
for
a
bit
more
kick
for
the
money
spent
however
not
a
bad
spring
or
fall
evening
brew
picked
this
one
up
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
beer
guy
at
wells
very
tasty
malty
nutty
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
glad
this
one
gives
me
a
chance
to
support
local
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
clipper
city
beer
ive
had
but
it
is
a
solid
offering
and
its
readily
available
since
i
live
within
10
miles
of
the
brewery
drinkabilityan
above
average
marzen
that
is
not
overly
complex
i
will
look
out
for
this
this
is
way
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
i
could
have
several
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
well
balanced
with
a
6
abv
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
solid
octoberfest
out
of
baltimore
draft
sierra
nothing
to
take
my
breath
away
smooth
and
malty
but
really
light
bitterness
and
mild
sweetness
the
flavors
i
was
looking
for
just
werent
there
however
so
far
my
favorite
cc
brew
the
maltiness
made
it
almost
drinkable
for
the
american
marzen
which
is
usually
one
of
the
things
i
dont
like
in
a
marzen
not
horrible
but
dont
need
again
drinkability
a
decent
effort
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
seems
like
a
light
oktoberfest
to
me
in
some
ways
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
oktoberfest
easy
to
drink
tastes
good
what
else
do
you
need
d
for
the
most
part
this
is
an
average
beer
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
but
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
overall
im
pretty
glad
this
was
a
single
in
the
closeout
rack
for
1
60
an
easier
drinker
but
not
alot
there
i
can
see
washing
down
some
boilded
shellfish
with
this
and
maybe
a
burger
or
brat
or
two
but
this
is
not
something
id
buy
again
poured
a
wellcarbd
hazy
gold
with
a
quickly
dying
head
a
strong
oily
bitter
hop
smell
with
a
minor
malt
base
a
rather
bland
beer
with
a
thin
to
medium
body
that
has
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
minor
bread
malt
presence
and
not
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
little
syrupyslimey
and
has
a
clean
but
weak
finish
this
was
rather
a
dud
in
my
book
as
it
was
just
a
vanilla
beer
with
not
much
in
the
hops
or
malt
department
and
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
pours
an
exceptionally
clear
pale
copper
color
with
a
small
soapy
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
some
pepper
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
bready
malt
some
grain
rust
and
mineral
water
a
light
earthy
hop
rounds
out
the
flavor
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
tingly
carbonation
sweet
overall
but
balanced
a
very
respectable
sample
of
the
style
perhaps
a
touch
light
but
seems
to
get
the
marzen
flavors
right
nice
to
see
that
it
avoided
any
buttery
flavors
as
some
american
marzens
seem
to
have
an
offorange
head
with
a
clearish
body
and
a
corn
malt
and
no
real
malt
body
and
no
real
fruitiness
and
no
real
lacing
toasted
crispness
is
the
only
real
noticeable
flavor
other
than
the
corn
and
a
bit
of
dried
green
raisin
a
bit
like
dried
toast
the
body
is
really
just
too
light
to
leave
a
lasting
taste
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
metallic
feeling
in
the
mouth
through
the
finish
i
thought
that
this
was
a
decent
märzen
it
wasnt
as
malty
as
mast
other
examples
of
the
style
which
could
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
your
preference
tasty
beer
but
the
experience
is
lacking
could
use
some
firmness
and
feel
and
some
head
retention
d
drinakability
is
pretty
high
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
1
finger
head
some
lacing
color
is
a
pale
golendish
the
smell
is
light
and
kindof
bready
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
light
with
some
fruitiness
not
to
crazy
about
this
beer
i
dont
regret
buying
it
but
its
not
gonna
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
id
rate
the
drinkability
on
this
higher
but
theres
sort
of
an
unbalanced
sweetness
on
this
one
that
gets
to
be
a
little
much
as
the
beer
warms
a
decent
marzen
but
there
are
others
that
id
probably
be
inclined
to
go
for
instead
a
pretty
good
marzen
very
similar
to
sam
adams
maybe
a
touch
sweeter
and
a
little
onesided
still
decent
effort
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
dimpled
mug
the
marzen
appears
a
hazed
apricot
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
light
rust
colored
foam
good
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
made
up
of
notes
of
sweet
biscuits
and
bread
fruits
such
as
apple
and
banana
caramel
malt
earthy
grassy
a
mild
nuttiness
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
levels
decent
enough
d
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
have
much
of
anything
to
make
it
go
any
way
good
or
bad
boring
and
offstyle
but
certainly
drinkable
in
large
quantities
note
love
the
white
trash
50s
throwback
waitress
names
hon
on
the
label
easily
drinkable
didnt
think
there
was
enough
character
for
me
to
make
it
really
enjoyable
but
ive
come
around
easily
make
for
a
decent
session
beer
or
to
pair
with
pizza
d
very
drinkable
solid
oktoberfest
not
as
good
as

ive
had
but
very
straight
forward
and
enjoyable
easily
could
be

this
is
a

foil
to
the

as

by
the

pours
a

smells
of
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
twang
the
taste
is
much
the
same
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
but
the
malt
prevails
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
light
but
this
contributes
to
higher
drinkability
drinkability
nice
malt
character
upfront
while
flavorful
not
to
be
confused
with
an
authentic
german
oktoberfest
beer
this
one
goes
down
smooth
found
this
on
tap
at
the
olney
ale
house
in
md
did
not
see
the
pour
so
i
hesitate
to
make
statements
about
the
head
it
had
a
pretty
good
persistent
head
on
it
when
it
arrived
at
the
table
medium
to
darker
amber
color
good
balanced
malt
taste
hops
were
clearly
present
but
not
dominant
not
a
beer
for
hop
heads
but
it
had
more
punch
than
british
styles
very
pleasant
im
not
usually
a
märzen
fan
but
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
another
good
beer
from
clipper
city
this
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
sticky
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
make
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
d
a
really
nice
choice
for
the
fall
although
not
my
favorite
fall
beer
i
would
certainly
enjoy
this
beer
again
balto

is
a
decent
märzen
that
goes
perfect
with
a
fried
oyster
sandwich
on
a
hot
beach
day
im
not
sure
a
marzen
can
get
much
better
than
this
one
its
my
new
favorite
gotta
get
back
to
baltimore
taste
is
solid
full
feel
malty

i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
beer
a
nice

bodied
full
flavored

d
not
a
bad
brew
very
sweet
and
lacked
a
bit
of
bitterness
an
above

beer
bordering
on
good
i
just
wish
one
flavor
would
stand
out

good

good
finish
highly
recommended
i
have
been
in
love
with
this
beer
after
trying
it
on
tap
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
marzen
style
beers
i
will
admit
that
i
love
the
malty
taste
and
the
crisp
finish
it
feels
almost
creamy
in
the
mouth
i
have
ordered
kegs
of
this
beer
for
parties
and
it
is
always
a
hit
light
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
some
fine
lace
smells
like
faint
euro
malts
and
toffee
tastes
kind
of
plain
but
pleasant
none
the
less
nothing
really
sticks
out

im
pretty
much
unimpressed
though
no
notes

stand
out

impressive

second

this
beer
goes
down
easy

a

i
would
enjoy
again
this
beer

pretty
clean

it

you
pause
for

great
aspects
its
just
a

beer
this
oktoberfest
lager
was
a
light
orange
color
out
of
the
bottle
with
great
clarity
through
the
liquid
the
head
was
slightly
orange
too
but
fairly
short

leaving

the
aroma
was
soft
dry
and
grainy
with
citrus
hops
and
pale
malt
being
most
defined
the
flavors
were
also
very
grainy
and
had
more
depth
than
the
aroma
suggested
at
first
i
got
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
toffee
followed
by
toasted
malt
and
citrus
hops
in
the
middle
the
flavors
went
all
grain
for
the
finish
which
was
notable
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
enough
the
carbonation
perfect
love
the
subtle
touch
of
this
brewery

the

outstanding

certainly
acceptable

could

this

a

of
this

wont
last

you
might
be
better
off
by

a

not
my

see
thomas

berkshire

but
a
good
solid
offering
and
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
again

slightly

mouthfeel
is
light

crisp
good

pretty
drinkable
but
not
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
have
had
numerous
better
i
was
expecting
more
from
clipper
city
to
be
honest
overall
its
one
of
the
better
american
versions
i
have
tried
at
first
the
taste
isnt
all
there
however
the
mouthfeel
is
so
good
it
makes
the
taste
better
in
fact
i
bumped
it
up
a
half
point
very
good
american
ofest
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
ofest
but
there
are
definitely
better
ones
out
there
poured
a
clear
amber
with
1
finger
of
foamy
offwhite
head
ok
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
lines
smells
of
butter
grain
bread
caramel
and
floral
hops
tastes
much
the
same
butter
and
caramel
up
front
with
some
bready
notes
as
well
as
bubble
gum
in
the
backbone
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
in
the
finish
medium
to
medium
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
smooth
and
sweet
but
a
little
thin
and
watery
in
places
worth
getting
once
but
it
felt
a
little
too
weak
compared
to
other
oktoberfests
out
there
to
session
i
guess
if
it
was
the
only
oktoberfest
on
tap
at
a
place
and
i
wanted
to
stick
with
that
style
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
a
light
rusty
water
crystal
clear
thin
patch
of
foam
3
50
s
let
me
make
an
obvious
statement
given
the
style
it
is
very
much
a
lager
crisp
and
clean
humid
cave
which
isnt
bad

had
this
one
on

at
my
schools
pub
poured
a
clear
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
short
lived
half
inch
head
smelled
sweet
mainly
caramel
although
not
a
very
strong
fragrance
good
tasting
marzen
not
strong
not
weak
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
definately
drink
this
one
again
but
if
theyd
offer
the
sam
seasonals
id
much
rather
drink
octoberfest
drinkability
nice
malt
character
upfront
but
not
a
lot
of
depth
while
flavorful
not
as
mouth
filling
and
therefore
awe
inspiring
as
some
oktoberfest
beers
d
easy
to
drink
would
be
good
at
a
bar
with
a
burger
but
nothing
spectacular
eh
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
good
but
not
at
the
top
of
the
style
for
me
overall
a
decent
offering
and
easily
drinkable
you
might
not
be
wowed
but
enjoyable
d
a
good
refreshing
ofest
not
overpowering
nor
overly
impressive
but
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
pretty
good
not
just
great
i
might
get
it
again
eric
this
is
a
very

oktoberfest
brew
and
definately
worth
a
try

plenty
of
supporting
hops
theres
some
bitterness
coming
through
but
not

hops
a
little
thin
and
tiring
to
drink
ehhh
md
quite
smooth
for
a
lager
no
bad
prickly
carbonation
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
i
drank
this
one
really
fast
a
tad
above
average
for
style
and
quite
enjoyable
appears
a
copper

hue

a
slight
off

in

12
liter
dimpled
stein
fine
even

left
between
each
sip
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
a
mild
nutty
moderately
roasted
malt
tone
with
light
herbal
hops
and
a
strong
mineral
water

is
equally
sweet
with
roasted
malts
as
it
is
spicy

herbal
edge
hop
notes
a
perfectly
balanced
malt
monster
i
really
enjoy
this
more
drinkable
version
of
the
americanized
oktoberfest
style
some
of
these
versions
are
too
heavy
with
the
caramel
malt
this
is
not
the
case
here
touch
of
caramel
and
mild
spicy
note
with
light
herbal
bitterness
with
mineral
water
notes
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
residually
sweet
with
some
sticky
texture
but
overall
a
sturdy
amount
of
carbonation
keeps
it
crisp
malt
wise
its
medium
bodied
and
something
i
could
down
by
the
liter
drinkability
is
honest
to
the
style
one
thing
i
demand
from
an
o
fest
beer
is
that
it
should
empty
from
my
glass
before
i
realize
its
gone
thats
definitely
the
case
with
this
beer
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
in
the
near
future
id
like
to
say
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
goes
down
easily
pours
a
decent
head
and
a
nice
oft
copper
color
tastes
nice
too
it
is
missing
a
bit
of
malt
is
all
needs
a
bit
more
flavor
other
than
that
this
is
a
darn
good
session
beer
fairly
dark
golden
not
really
what
i
would
call
an
amber
color
head
was
about
a
finger
faded
to
nothingness
within
a
couple
of
minutes
smell
was
faint
honey
taste
is
sweet
and
well
sweet
theres
not
much
going
on
here
to
hold
my
interest
its
easy
enough
drinking
but
im
not
sure
i
want
to
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
beer
to
serve
to
a
macrodrinking
friend
to
start
leading
them
towards
the
light
but
not
something
thats
going
to
have
much
appeal
to
micro
fans
many
octoberfests
are
excellent
session
beers
and
this
one
truly
fits
that
category
ill
be
back
to
julios
for
some
repeat
purchases
as
the
octoberfest
season
continues
good
thing
i
only
tried
a
single
bottle
marzen
is
my
favorite
style
and
this
just
seems
to
fall
short
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
had
this
on
tap
at
espn
zone
in
the
baltimore
harbor
ok
beer
overall
pours
a
clear
amber
sweet
malty
nose
flavor
is
smoothly
sweet
at
first
but
quickly
starts
getting
obnoxious
in
the
sweet
minor
grain
tones
but
that
sweet
is
really
getting
harsh
by
this
point
feel
is
sticky
overall
this
adds
up
missing
the
mark
and
half
of
it
gets
left
at
the
bar
6abv
yet
goes
down
easy
not
too
heavy
not
too
sweet
yet
the
right
flavor
to
keep
this
interesting
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
fine
example
of
a
marzen
which
can
be
drunken
in
quantity
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
it
is
quite
unique
for
the
style
according
to
the
brewery
this
is
now
a
yearround
offering
with
a
new
label
fortunate
to
get
one
now
where
did
i
put
it
worth
a
try
but
not
the
depiction
of
the
style
even
for
an
american
brewery
wish
these
beers
were
available
here
in
nj
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
while
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
hop
character
here
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
with
a
very
tasty
sweet
and
bready
maltiness
this
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
no
head
it
smelled
very
faint
and
clean
like
hazelnut
malt
and
refined
yeast
it
tasted
like
watery
caramel
malt
with
rich
hazelnut
and
barley
flavors
and
no
real
hops
or
bitterness
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
clean
aftertaste
overall
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
lagers
ive
had
it
was
very
clean
and
refreshing
like
a
better
quality
killians
not
a
bad
marzen
style
beer
i
found
it
pretty
refreshing
and
would
go
great
on
a
warm
day
recommended
i
used
to
love
the
lucknow
vienna
lager
this
is
a
great
replacement
for
it
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
if
i
was
to
see
this
at
the
store
id
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
easydrinkin
beer
light
but
flavorful
and
satisfying
i
also
think
it
is
underrated
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
perhaps
it
suffers
because
of
comparisons
to
the
highpowered
heavy
seas
line
this
beer
is
6
abv
could
they
have
gotten
as
much
flavor
into
it
and
made
it
more
sessionable
knock
back
2
or
3
with
a
lower
abv
dunno
still
i
recommend
this
stuff
the
flavor
what
there
is
of
it
is
enjoyable
but
as
much
as
i
want
to
like
it
its
gone
before
i
can
really
decide
and
yet
its
not
so
bad
it
drinks
easily
enough
but
its
not
inspirational
i
like
it
for
as
long
as
it
lets
me
drinkability
tasty
nothing
grand
but
certainly
serviceable
ill
enjoy
the
sixer
thin
swift
head
on
a
soft
brown
semieffervescent
body
in
a
willibecker
moderate
cerealgrain
malt
taste
quite
pleasing
and
surprising
considering
the
usual
alcoholmongering
this
brewery
pedals
lively
medium
dry
palate
initial
sweetness
in
average
duration
wowthis
fits
the
oktoberfest
spirit
well
this
smooth
and
sharp
brew
is
characterfilled
and
appropriate
a
shame
its
a
seasonal
overall
this
beer
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
bad
id
have
it
again
if
it
was
free
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
not
quite
amber
color
soft
offwhite
head
aroma
of
faintly
caramelized
grains
flavor
of
very
mild
nutty
caramel
malt
but
with
a
cleansing
dryness
medium
body
and
a
lightly
caramelized
finish
im
not
sure
this
is
the
number
one
vienna
lager
in
america
as
recent
awards
indicate
but
i
certainly
wont
argue
with
it
being
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
year
round
availability
too
i
got
a
bottle
of
balto
marzhon
that
says
santahon
on
it
but
because
it
says
marzen
lager
below
i
believe
its
the
same
beer
this
beer
pours
a
largely
translucent
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
is
of
watery
malt
with
no
notes
of
hops
there
is
no
real
kick
to
the
taste
it
is
mostly
traditional
medium
color
malts
it
goes
down
with
a
thick
consistency
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
space
out
the
beer
which
detracts
from
its
drinkability
there
is
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
spice
at
the
very
end
which
dances
on
the
tongue
but
for
the
most
part
its
a
onedimensional
taste
the
first
beer
that
ive
had
by
clipper
city
that
i
thought
was
marginal
the
rest
have
been
outstanding
this
one
starts
with
a
moderate
malt
moderate
grain
balance
with
a
hint
of
sulfer
in
the
nose
the
hops
seem
to
balance
the
beer
well
with
earthy
pungent
hops
and
a
light
grassy
note
the
standard
copper
look
releases
fair
head
retention
that
hangs
around
til
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
tastes
more
malty
round
and
smooth
than
the
nose
suggested
along
side
of
a
mild
hop
flavor
and
a
bitter
balance
that
struggles
to
keep
up
with
the
moderate
maltiness
the
texture
is
where
i
have
problems
the
beer
lacks
depth
creaminess
and
seems
to
fall
apart
going
into
the
finish
the
linger
brings
up
colalike
aftertastes
and
a
light
hop
grain
astringency
a
fair
marzen
it
just
gets
lost
in
the
plethera
of
good
oktoberfest
marzens
oelergud
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
since
this
comes
across
to
me
as
marzenlite
this
needs
a
bit
more
malt
punch
to
get
this
up
into
the
good
category
d
easily
drinkable
but
i
was
ready
to
get
this
one
over
with
about
halfway
through
not
one
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
afterwards
though
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
slight
hops
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
malty
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
marzen
at
that
recommended
drinkability
nicely
session
able
a
nice
solid
beer
if
only
the
taste
could
stand
up
to
the
mouthfeel
i
would
probably
rank
this
beer
but
higher
but
it
just
doesnt
cut
the
mustard
poured
a
hazy
orange
light
brownish
tan
color
almost
like
a
dark
straw
color
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipated
really
quickly
no
real
lacing
present
in
the
glass
clearly
marked
freshness
date
on
the
label
smell
was
dough
like
with
some
slight
sweet
and
sour
tones
rather
mild
malt
scent
not
the
sweet
caramel
tone
i
have
smelled
in
other
marzen
style
oktoberfest
there
was
a
rather
light
malt
flavor
with
a
thin
body
no
real
heft
to
this
brew
it
is
smooth
but
not
what
i
would
call
my
favorite
offering
of
this
style
seemed
like
they
were
going
their
own
direction
with
this
one
light
and
drinkable
but
i
would
only
have
this
one
once
maybe
it
is
better
on
tap
overall
not
the
best
brew
but
also
not
the
worst
either
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
loved
it
but
hadnt
tried
it
in
a
bottle
so
i
bought
a
sixer
fortunately
its
fresh
in
our
area
and
this
beer
even
in
a
bottle
was
really
quite
good
i
took
the
clipper
city
tour
awhile
back
and
so
i
know
they
know
beer
nice
orangeamber
color
decent
head
and
refreshingly
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
taste
was
incredibly
balanced
if
not
really
complex
nice
sweet
but
just
a
bit
so
malt
flavor
with
carmel
notes
and
a
delicately
fruity
hops
flavor
thrown
in
for
good
measure
definitely
something
ill
come
back
to
good
job
hugh
drinkability
nice
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
different
from
its
german
forebears
but
still
very
good
this
is
a
flavorful
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
wish
was
avaialble
around
my
way
i
guess
its
not
exactly
a
typical
marzen
but
its
a
good
beer
d
i
have
in
the
past
found
over
maerzens
to
be
too
sweet
to
have
much
dirnkability
this
one
does
not
have
that
problem
but
the
flavor
which
from
what
i
can
tell
is
pretty
good
is
masked
this
is
drinkable
because
the
high
carbonation
decent
flavor
and
mild
yet
pleasant
bitterness
mesh
to
make
this
a
beer
you
throw
back
for
hours
but
the
carbonation
really
kills
my
desire
to
ever
have
it
again
not
an
awful
beer
but
not
worth
a
second
try
imo
d
i
dont
know
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
hit
the
spot
when
i
drank
it
while
cooking
i
actually
used
some
to
baste
my
new
years
eve
sausages
and
they
came
out
quite
tasty
a
clean
orangeamber
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
light
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
character
with
a
light
peppery
hop
background
and
a
hint
of
apple
those
caramel
and
toffee
notes
dominate
the
taste
with
a
nice
light
peppery
hop
snap
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
and
throat
on
the
finish
definitely
a
pleasing
drink
cheers
a
solid
marzen
and
quite
easy
to
drink
baltomarzhon
is
a
pretty
good
effort
all
things
considered
im
sure
that
better
oktoberfests
will
be
entering
my
glass
this
fall
but
this
was
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
way
to
get
the
season
started
thanks
to
merlins
own
lackenhauser
for
the
bottle
a
gift
from
higravity
thanks
for
the
opportunity
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
over
a
seriously
cloudy
apricot
colored
liquid
smells
of
caramel
soured
grain
and
honey
taste
smooth
caramel
with
a
tinge
of
carb
sting
thats
distracting
smooth
malt
hint
of
butter
some
tannin
overall
dry
in
the
mouth
slick
mouthfeel
like
syruped
wort
md
body
drinkability
is
okay
but
the
fine
carb
is
too
sharp
for
the
style
plus
the
slick
mouthfeel
and
butter
suggest
a
pedio
infection
if
no
infection
these
characteristics
certainly
dont
belong
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
modest
head
that
leaves
a
nice
belgian
lace
behind
very
malty
with
hints
of
spices
a
solid
mouthfeel
with
a
warming
quality
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
oktoberfest
varieties
on
the
market
i
believe
cc
brews
this
year
round
as
one
of
their
lighter
brews
lighter
in
the
sense
that
it
doesnt
explode
with
hops
like
their
other
great
selections
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
new
favorites
to
be
fair
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
german
lager
styles
and
this
one
certainly
fits
into
that
category
neverthess
it
has
its
own
character
and
popiness
that
is
in
hindsight
not
surprising
from
clipper
city
if
you
like
this
style
id
recommend
this
beer
i
know
this
is
past
its
best
by
date
but
it
has
been
sitting
in
the
beer
pantry
all
winter
and
this
si
the
last
of
the
ones
i
had
good
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
and
plenty
of
lace
the
smell
is
bready
and
nice
caramel
maltiness
munich
malt
is
all
over
this
and
the
spicy
hops
help
clean
it
up
and
help
the
finish
into
a
nice
dry
overall
winner
easy
drinking
and
something
to
have
next
year
for
sure
foggy
gold
white
foam
minimal
lace
and
plenty
of
columns
of
bubbles
clean
husky
grain
nose
but
not
much
else
taste
is
spicy
and
mild
sweet
malts
solid
mouthfeel
for
the
style
holds
up
over
the
course
of
the
taste
finish
is
short
but
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
once
again
as
expected
for
the
style
i
know
its
too
late
for
this
style
but
i
couldnt
let
it
go
to
waste
the
artwork
led
me
to
try
it
and
the
beer
made
me
stay
ok
so
not
the
best
approach
but
it
works
i
found
it
to
be
smooth
with
a
nice
color
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
6
beers
i
have
had
it
has
become
the
crossover
beer
for
people
in
my
circle
of
friends
as
we
bring
new
beer
geeks
in
to
the
fold
12
ounce
bottle
the
label
on
mine
was
a
bit
different
with
an
old
man
and
old
woman
on
the
label
purchased
at
norms
in
vienna
best
before
oct
05
notches
on
the
label
this
was
a
nice
malty
beer
it
smelled
like
sweet
malt
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
it
tastes
much
the
same
with
a
nice
sweetness
with
a
very
slight
toasted
taste
around
the
edges
the
finish
was
just
bitter
enough
to
balance
it
out
this
left
a
lingering
sweetness
which
was
nice
but
can
get
a
bit
strong
after
a
while
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
offwhite
head
above
the
dark
goldlight
copper
brew
head
fades
slowly
but
surely
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
yet
well
balanced
taste
all
seems
to
meld
together
so
well
its
hard
to
pick
out
the
components
wellbalanced
here
as
well
with
pale
malt
sweetness
tempered
by
careful
hopping
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
would
just
look
for
a
bit
more
maltiness
but
thats
just
me
good
stuff
here

just

another
solid
offering
from
clipper
city
this
isnt
my
favourite
style
but
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
dig
the
mouthfeel
it
changes
as
the
drink
progresses
through
your
mouth
initially
clean
and
fast
it
finishes
medium
heavy
with
a
lingering
sweetness
that
is
cut
with
hop
dryness
great
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
1l
ceramic
glasses
that
i
used
to
pound
at
the
paulaner
brewhaus
in
bangkok
has
gone
well
by
itself
as
a
fishin
beer
but
weve
also
used
it
successfully
to
wash
down
a
dozen
or
so
blue
crabs
mmm
another
quality
clipper
city
offering
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
very
close
to
style
and
a
real
pleasant
drink
it
pours
a
crystalclear
amber
body
with
an
orange
cast
and
glowing
golden
highlights
beneath
a
frothy
head
of
white
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
thin
smatterings
of
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
fresh
with
delicately
sweetish
lightly
bready
moderately
toasty
and
subtly
juicy
malts
are
there
some
vienna
malts
in
here
and
enticing
floral
hops
its
easy
to
go
over
the
top
with
the
maltiness
but
this
ones
perfect
and
its
also
perfectly
mediumbodied
without
being
overly
dextrinous
or
too
thin
and
its
very
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
gives
a
light
caress
to
the
palate
and
awakens
the
tastebuds
the
flavor
is
much
as
the
nose
suggests
with
its
honeyglazed
nutty
bread
crust
maltiness
appearing
upfront
immediately
followed
by
rising
notes
of
deliciously
floral
hops
the
bitterness
is
omnipresent
but
repressed
and
theyve
done
a
brilliant
job
of
balancing
this
one
this
is
a
brilliantly
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
and
satisfying
maerzen
that
rivals
the
best

germany

not
a
complex
brew
overall
but
one
i
would
feel
comfortable
enjoying
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
definitly
not
up
to
par
with
the
other
beers
that
come
out
of
clipper
city
the
flavor
isnt
anything
special
and
gets
old
quickly
i
think
the
penn
oktoberfest
is
a
much
better
example
of
the
style
this
beer
looks
absolutely
perfect
bright
clear
orange
amber
in
color
with
a
slow
and
steady
carbonation
the
head
is
a
wonderfully
rich
mass
of
creamy
sea
foam
that
produced
some
small
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
just
as
nice

slightly
sweet
slightly
spicy
graininess
with
an
onion
grass
character
theres
also
a
soapy
chewiness
here
taste
is
smooth
and
only
slightly
bitter
sweet
malt
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
like
other
marzens
ive
had

but
i
think
its
a
good
thing
in
this
beer
the
lighter
than
expected
body
compliments
this
beer
its
well
blended
overall
and
highly
drinkable
cc
has
become
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
not
a
bad
beer
just
disappointing
for
me
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hard
times
in
herndon
va
this
came
out
a
clear
orange
dark
orange
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
head
dropped
quick
leaving
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
was
most
prominent
with
a
surprisingly
strong
hops
presence
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
a
bittersweet
after
taste
is
how
this
one
ends
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
with
and
is
clean
and
crisp
going
down
more
drinkable
to
me
than
most
marzens
with
the
hops
keeping
up
pace
with
the
malt
pretty
good
for
the
style
which
is
one
i
usually
avoid
overall
very
drinkable
and
should
be
popular
in
bawlmer
really
nice
octoberfest
very
smooth
and
not
bitter
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
ive
ever
tasted
great
big
fan
of
harpoon
brewery
this
oktofest
doesnt
disappoint
overall
i
though
this
was
a
fairly
good
beer
i
thought
that
maybe
they
could
tone
down
the
metallic
tastes
a
bit
and
turn
up
the
malty
taste
a
bit
but
still
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
clear
mahogany
with
a
thick
pale
wheat
head
aroma
has
strong
tones
of
cloves

horehound
malty

has
notes
of
horehound
cloves
and
malt
with
an
earthy
undertone
and
a
hint
of
caramel
smooth

has
good
body
and

not

nothing

i
can

of
other
octoberfests
that
i
like
better
i
generally
like
harpoon
but
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
mouthfeel
light
bodied
moderate
carb
tries
too
hard
to
be
balanced
for
those
who
want
hoppiness
in
their
beer
but
fails
at
being
a
legit
oktoberfest
beer
imo
it
is
a
fine
beer
as
in
the
hoppy
aftertaste
well
balances
the
malty
forefront
of
the
beer
but
its
not
what
i
would
call
a
proper
oktoberfest
beer
pretty
good
octoberfest
had
this
poured
into

the
best

a

nothing

no

just
try
it

the

trailed

the
smell
was
full
of
bread

the

was
smooth
with
flavors
popping
up
from

giving
a
full

the

was
also
nice
not

this

a

i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
o
i
enjoyed

and
would
drink
it
again

i
dont

a

have

no

borderlinenotanoktoberfest
compare
with

better
fall
beers
or
oktoberfests
ive
had
full
bodied
but
not
over
the
top
simplicity
can
be
a
good
thing
sometimes
o
decent
marzen
but
that
somewhat
sharp
tinge
detracts
apparently
my
palate
and
tettnang
and
willamette
hops
do
not
get
along
as
well
as
they
should
pours
a
striking
autumnal
copper
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
bready
the
flavor
profile
is
highlighted
by
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malt
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
touch
lighter
in
body
than
the
very
best
of
the
style
but
this
is
still
a
superior
effort
harpoon
should
require
its
octoberfest
be
served
with
a
soft
pretzel
and
mustard
i
mean
it
even
when
purchased
at
the
grocery
store
this
longneck
is
well
balanced
and
malty
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
blended
spice
and
nut
flavors
overall
exactly
as
one
would
expect
although
it
was
thin
bodied
for
what
i
would
expect
from
an
octoberfest
brew
overall
this
is
another
solid
american
version
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
very
good
this
is
another
oktoberfest
beer
that
ill
have
to
add
to
my
rotation
well
its
october
month
of
the
octoberfest
when
every
brewery
has
their
special
october
brew
out
harpoon
has
never
disappointed
so
lets
give
this
one
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
sweet
waft
of
malts
and
grapelike
olfactory
inputs
the
brew
pours
to
a
bright
orange
color
with
a
nice
large
bubble
head
that
has
a
creamy
top
on
the
taste
this
brew
is
as
sweet
as
it
smells
but
not
overly
so
typical
of
its
style
there
is
not
much
if
any
bitterness
present
the
taste
is
consistent
throughout
with
a
solid
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
very
slight
dry
chalkiness
in
the
the
finish
that
cleanses
the
palate
of
the
bold
sweetness
a
very
good
beer
great
for
the
style
and
quite
sessionable
o
i
picked
up
a
12pack
because
i
needed
something
to
last
a
while
due
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
it
did
not
last
a
while
i
expected
to
have
one
every
night
or
so
and
almost
always
had
two
very
enjoyable
im
not
typically
a
huge
fan
of
harpoon
but
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
here
notes
this
is
my
first
full
review
and
not
my
favorite
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
good
drinkable
beer
fits
with
other
harpoon
styled
beers
overall
this
is
definitely
an
americanized
verison
of
the
style
but
i
quite
like
it
a
little
more
bitterness
and
roast
and
it
works
very
nicely
overall
i
really
like
this
marzenoctoberfest
this
is
my
second
six
pack
ive
worked
through
the
imports
and
a
few
domestic
tributes
and
ive
come
back
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
cheers
o
what
a
dissapointment
has
an
attractive
appearance
and
an
interesting
aroma
taste
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
really
nothing
like
the
other
beers
in
this
style
would
never
knowingly
have
this
beer
again
overall
pretty
solid
beer
another
local
favorite
i
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
fall
has
arrived
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
oktoberfest
overall
it
was
a
little
on
the
maltier
side
but
was
balanced
nicely
with
a
good
base
of
sweet
flavors
and
some
lighter
flavors
of
spice
nut
and
grass
a
good
one
to
try
perhaps
it
was
slightly
infected
but
that
dry
metallic
taste
is
puts
me
off
notes
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
which
are
still
very
good
definitely
one
of
the
better
common
american
oktoberfest
beers
overall
solid
brew
im
not
usually
into
the
style
but
this
was
definitely
enjoyable
fans
of
the
more
traditional
style
may
not
be
100
sold
on
this
one
since
it
is
definitely
an
adaptation
of
sorts
on
harpoons
end
overall
im
a
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
and
my
ratings
show
it
best
beer
to
date
appearance
brings
it
down
but
it
smells
as
its
supposed
to
and
well
in
the
end
it
gets
an
ok
in
my
book
this
is
an
enjoyable
oktoberfest
malt
is
clearly
noticeable
on
the
nose
and
tongue
the
most
interesting
thing
for
me
was
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
that
never
quite
left
my
mouth
i
would
probably
get
this
again
o
i
used
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
as
i
grow
fonder
of
the
ipas
i
do
believe
i
have
moved
beyond
the
octoberfest
beers
part
of
the
season
like
the
foliage

is

copper
color
with
a

1
finger
fairly
dense
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
pear
apple
toast
toffee
biscuit
nuttiness
molasses
and
herbal
hops
damn
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
fits
the
style
very
well
taste
of
caramel
toast
brown
sugar
toffee
pear
apple
biscuit
light
nuttiness
floral
and

minimal
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
expected
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
light
fruits
toast
biscuit
toffee
light
nuttiness
and
herbal
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
pretty
nice
flavor
balance
and
complexity
but
it
was
not
as
robust
feeling
as
i
was
hoping
from
the
aromas
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
pretty
much
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oktoberfest
style
nice
flavor
balance
and
complexity
and
very
smooth
to
drink
as
expected
could
have
used
a
bit
fuller
flavor
but
this
was
still
a
very
good
style
representation
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
nice
beer
when
you
want
something
tasty
but
want
to
not
get
filled
up
with
a
heavier
type
beer
overall
this
was
very
good
and
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
on
a
nice
crisp
afternoon
drinking
at
a
backyard
party
a
definite
fall
treat
rjt
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
rendition
of
the
octoberfest
a
must
try
this
beer
has
way
too
much
head
just
taste
too
boozey
smells
boozey
just
nothing
else
say
about
this
beer
too
dark
in
color
not
a
winner
skip
it
bring
nothing
to
octoberfeat
so
nothing
else
to
say
keep
moving
i
have
taste
better
beer
and
this
isnt
one
them
taste
is
fairly
straight
forward
caramel
upfront
and
dominate
high
carbonation
keeps
things
crisp
and
refreshing
mild
hops
too
keep
things
somewhat
balanced
i
like
this
its
really
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
ill
look
forward
to
it
for
on
now
great
flavors
of
caramel
sweetness
mild
toffee
crackers
bready
flavors
on
the
back
end
all
of
these
meld
well
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
tasty
beer
here
that
is
a
good
representation
by
an
american
brewery
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
sixer
of
this
in
the
fridge
each
and
every
fall
overall
it
has
all
the
strong
points
of
a
harpoon
beer
but
the
maltiness
is
overpowering
probably
the
best
octoberfest
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
enough
to
make
me
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
i
had
one
straight
from
the
bottle
and
another
poured
into
a
glass
better
to
pour
theres
a
slight
metallic
taste
that
goes
away
as
the
beers
fizzes
a
little
looks
lovely
in
the
glass
a
golden
amber
less
deep
in
color
than
other
examples
of
the
style
it
also
has
more
hop
character
than
is
typical
pleasant
though
backed
well
by
the
malt
and
just
a
little
caramel
nice
feel
i
recommend
it
o
this
one
started
well
but
then
seemed
to
slide
it
tasted
like
the
malts
were
overcooked
or
maybe
that
was
the
hop
character
either
way
this
wasnt
a
very
good
oktoberfest
to
me
overall
i
thought
this
beer
wasnt
that
good
and
it
was
a
below
average
example
of
the
style
it
just
lacked
all
the
things
that
make
for
a
good
marzen
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
thin
flavors
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
feel
no
need
to
have
another
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
didnt
look
that
bad
and
it
was
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
was
pretty
flat
with
some
unneeded
flavors
and
bitterness
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
really
didnt
have
any
redeeming
quailitys
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
all
in
all
this
was
another
beer
i
didnt
like
from
harpoon
brewery
so
far
they
might
be
my
least
favorite
microbrewery
and
i
dont
know
if
i
will
give
them
another
chance
this
marzen
fell
pretty
short
and
it
just
wasnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
ofests
that
ive
had
lately
just
solid
balance
to
the
flavors
and
feel
here
that
kept
this
interesting
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
few
new
to
me
ones
that
im
actually
glad
i
checked
out
this
season
o
a
great
fall
beer
that
does
the
style
well
even
if
its
really
an
ale
very
rich
and
flavorful
with
plenty
of
body
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
an
oktoberfest
fan
or
like
to
try
seasonalworthy
beers
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
has
great
drinkability
it
has
good
flavor
as
well
this
would
have
gotten
a
higher
rating
if
the
hops
didnt
overpower
the
malty
flavors
its
worth
a
try
unfortunately
a
fairly
flawed
example
of
the
style
fruity
esters
and
phenols
are
the
majority
of
the
character
of
the
brew
unfortunate
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
this
style
anyway
but
i
have
has
plenty
other
ofests
that
were
much
better
than
this
one
this
came
in
a
mix
12
pack
so
three
will
be
more
than
enough
for
me
its
like
that
guy
at
the
toga
party
actually
wearing
a
laurel
that
majored
in
philosophy
right
idea
just
no
5
3
abv
for
the
record
no
indication
of
bottling
date
harpoons
octoberfest
is
among
the
best
american
märzens
ive
tried
ill
be
sure
to
drink
it
again
next
year
o
little
bit
of
a
different
take
on
the
style
but
overall
a
very
nice
fall
welcomer
i
especially
enjoyed
the
extra
kick
of
spice
in
this
one
it
makes
for
a
relaxing
beer
on
a
fall
day
and
one
of
the
better
ofests
ive
had
this
season
so
far
while
it
lacks
some
of
the
flavor
punch
i
desire
it
makes
up
for
it
with
its
smooth
quality
overall
i
like
this
harpoon
was
able
to
put
their
own
twist
on
the
style
without
overdoing
it
like
many
other
american
breweries
o
im
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
one
it
wouldnt
be
considered
a
true
marzen
to
the
style
nazis
but
as
a
spiced
fall
lager
it
really
hits
the
spot
pass
overall
very
much
enjoying
this
inoffensive
tasty
and
exceptionally
crushable
o
very
drinkable
love
the
flavor
of
this
version
of
the
style
this
is
the
first
octoberfest
i
have
had
this
year
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
overall
very
solid
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
actually
forgot
i
had
this
best
by
121511
i
might
come
back
next
year
and
edit
this
review
this
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
massive
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
of
malts
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
enough
a
little
bitterness
mostly
malts
caramel
bread
and
toffee
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
malts
up
front
caramel
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
some
breadiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
best
octoberfests
out
imo
overall
im
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
hope
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
maybe
ill
give
it
another
go
and
change
my
opinion
next
year
another
tardy
ofest
review
sue
me
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
buttery
biscuit
light
orange
zest
and
a
few
drops
of
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
grass
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
this
is
the
epitome
of
an
average
ofest
i
dont
mean
that
as
a
negative
necessarily
but
this
stuff
doesnt
endear
itself
to
me
enough
for
me
to
think
purely
positively
of
it
its
just
average
o
a
good
octoberfest
style
beer
nothing
too
flashy
here
just
straightforward
and
solid
a
worthy
fall
beer
o
good
for
the
style
decent
to
me
o
a
pretty
good
octoberfest
in
a
market
that
gets
bombarded
with
good
and
bad
marzans
during
the
fall
a
reddish
brown
amber
on
the
pour
with
a
nice
lasting
tan
head
aroma
and
taste
of
moderately
toasted
malt
barley
some
nice
yeast
and
breadiness
with
some
slight
fruity
notes
and
light
hops
a
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
malty
yeast
some
breadiness
a
slight
note
of
dark
fruit
with
a
nice
moderate
hops
and
lightly
lingering
nutty
ending
overall
a
nice
drinkable
oktoberfest
overallim
not
sure
if
this
style
will
actually
ever
just
blow
me
away
but
ive
had
some
good
ones
this
fall
w
harpoons
falling
in
that
group
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
a
nice
balance
of
toasted
malts
and
some
fall
spices
toasted
grains
with
some
slight
bitter
and
sweet
components
for
balance
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
this
is
a
nice
octoberfest
oi
was
a
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
i
did
not
think
i
would
turn
out
as
good
as
it
did
the
malt
works
well
and
it
lacks
the
flat
finish
i
sometimes
get
in
an
oktoberfest
o
very
good
a
solid
seasonal
pick
and
repeat
purchase
harpoon
turned
in
an
above
average
american
oktoberfest
here
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
clear
amber
coloring
with
a
thin
frothy
densely
foamed
offwhite
head
that
has
a
very
decent
staying
power
to
it
aromas
are
rich
and
malty
with
nut
and
toffee
highlights
and
very
light
roast
and
cinnamon
hints
flavor
is
rich
with
a
roast
and
slightly
bitter
hops
undertone
the
rich
malt
characteristics
of
toffee
and
nut
are
creamy
and
smooth
with
the
sharp
bitter
and
roast
character
helping
to
balance
and
cut
the
feel
in
the
mouth
the
afteratste
is
a
bit
of
a
tangy
sweet
with
a
green
spice
flavor
that
cleans
off
the
palate
the
finish
has
a
slight
linger
but
only
the
spicing
really
lasts
for
any
time
good
flavors
and
decent
balance
throughout
o
looks
nice
smells
wonderful
i
liked
this
better
than
the
heavy
seas
o
goes
down
easy
and
fits
the
style
well
a
solid
beer
but
wont
blow
your
socks
off
year
in
year
out
this
east
coast
brewery
brings
it
o
solid
example
of
an
oktoberfest
certainly
hits
the
spot
on
a
cool
evening
o
so
far
my
favorite
marzen
of
the
year
though
ive
only
had
three
or
four
others
so
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
as
an
example
of
type
and
could
drink
it
as
a
oneoff
or
as
a
sessioner
more
good
stuff
from
harpoon
o
light
smell
but
good
flavor
it
gives
you
sweet
and
bitter
taste
while
not
being
too
harsh
on
either
end
this
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
friends
on
a
cool
fall
day
i
can
almost
feel
the
falling
leaves
blow
past
me
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
taste
pretty
good
and
isnt
too
filling
cant
go
wrong
pickin
this
one
up
this
pours
a
brownorange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
slightly
nutty
malts
the
taste
is
pretty
spoton
with
the
toasty
malty
nuttiness
with
just
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
however
theres
a
lingering
sweetness
that
i
dont
really
welcome
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
and
the
drinkability
is
impacted
by
the
oversweetened
finish
overall
not
really
worth
buying
over
the
slew
of
better
oktoberfests
both
domestic
and
imported
opinion
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
oktoberfest
style
when
it
is
done
right
i
personally
like
hacker
pschorr
the
best
and
i
have
a
case
sitting
on
the
floor
in
my
office
right
now
all
this
said
the
harpoon
version
is
obviously
intended
to
be
an
oktoberfest
but
it
is
falling
short
on
the
mouthfeel
especially
it
seems
like
their
technique
is
close
but
the
water
may
need
to
be
filtered
and
the
grain
bill
tweaked
to
get
them
in
they
would
need
to
back
off
on
the
crystal
and
use
more
munich
malt
for
toasty
notes
and
the
color
adding
about
25
distilled
water
may
be
all
they
need
too
to
put
this
beer
right
in
there
regardless
this
is
a
pretty
decent
attempt
at
an
ofest
o
a
pretty
tasty
brew
definitely
hits
the
spot
for
chilly
fall
days
and
makes
for
very
easy
drinking
its
interesting
to
see
a
slightly
more
hopheavy
rendition
of
the
old
german
style
a
nice
bostonian
twist
on
an
oktoberfest
definitely
pick
up
if
you
like
beers
with
hints
of
fruit
or
slight
sweet
tastes
it
is
not
overpowering
as
to
detriment
the
beer
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
ive
had
other
oktoberfests
that
ive
preferred
by
far
o
harpoon
has
produced
an
octoberfest
beer
which
keeps
in
mind
german
tradition
but
also
includes
american
tastes
it
is
a
beauty
to
look
at
in
the
glass
and
it
certainly
has
a
nice
bit
of
malt
though
the
beer
is
not
overhopped
it
does
have
a
bit
more
hop
kick
than
might
be
necessary
for
a
marzen
style
beer
while
a
slight
hop
edge
does
help
balance
the
star
of
a
marzen
style
is
supposed
to
be
the
malt
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
if
you
are
in
search
of
the
more
malt
dominated
marzen
style
you
may
be
disappointed
by
the
hop
level
in
this
one
i
had
this
on
tap
a
few
nights
ago
at
a
local
restaurant
id
had
this
in
the
bottle
a
couple
of
years
back
so
its
hard
to
compare
i
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
it
had
a
nice
copper
color
not
much
head
and
a
moderate
carbonation
very
nice
toasty
flavor
to
it
similar
to
a
lot
of
other
marzens
i
like
this
one
it
has
a
great
drinkable
balance
the
best
oktoberfest
i
have
had
this
year
a
very
smooth
and
fullbodied
seasonal
offering
harpoon
has
nailed
it
again
one
sip
of
this
ale
ushers
in
a
feeling
of
fall
and
cooler
weather
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
a
very
good
representation
of
jeanswearing
football
season
o
the
beer
goes
down
quite
easy
and
is
rather
sessionable
it
sort
of
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
vienna
lager
and
a
märzen
medium
bodied
here
but
the
body
is
somewhat
oily
good
carbonation
here
not
bad
here
i
tend
to
enjoy
harpoon
a
decent
take
on
a
classic
style
o
very
nice
american
take
on
the
style
reminds
me
a
little
of
hackerpschorrs
amber
märzen
glad
i
took
the
chance
overall
i
am
glad
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
pumpkin
beer
since
its
closer
to
what
i
expect
for
the
style
for
some
reason
though
i
doubt
i
will
be
finding
cases
of
the
stuff
since
the
market
is
flooded
at
the
moment
with
other
brands
just
singles
pretty
good
fest
beer
bready
but
with
a
refreshing
lightness
in
the
flavor
o
decent
octoberfest
rather
crisp
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
year
o
a
nice
example
of
a
oktoberfest
ale
has
a
nice
combination
of
caramel
and
fruity
flavors
most
of
the
germanbrewed
oktoberfest
beers
are
far
lighter
in
malt
character
than
this
better
americanmade
versions
as
well
this
is
a
solid
offering
but
i
do
wish
the
flavor
profile
was
stronger
mo
not
as
drinkable
as
sam
adams
actually
a
bit
hot
despite
the
low
abv
worthy
of
a
single
bottle
purchase
though
overall
not
bad
sweet
malts
reddish
caramel
malts
not
really
toasty
enough
or
straw
for
me
creamy
malt
taste
is
different
and
not
really
any
crisp
clean
lager
taste
hops
are
also
a
different
and
interesting
mix
o
an
american
octberfest
i
cant
tell
the
difference
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
have
had
before
finally
reviewed
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
reddish
orange
highlights
a
nice
dense
foam
head
that
fades
away
the
smell
is
grainy
and
malty
with
subtle
sweet
notes
tied
in
the
taste
is
big
with
the
malt
up
front
and
moves
to
a
substantial
bitter
hop
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
malt
undertone
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
and
rich
a
nice
complex
beer
that
hits
many
flavors
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
a
different
take
one
that
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
an
octoberfest
tinged
american
ale
the
real
thing
that
competes
with
the
germans
harpoon
really
nailed
it
poured
out
the
darker
side
of
amber
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
vanishes
quickly
i
love
the
color
of
this
beer
nose
has
a
metallic
roasted
grain
character
with
some
zesty
hop
aromas
floating
around
extremely
smooth
medium
body
upfront
there
is
a
lot
of
german
malts
and
honey
finishes
with
a
subtle
hop
zest
and
dry
a
roasted
malt
honey
sweetness
lingers
over
the
dryness
evening
it
out
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
with
a
12pk
being
around
10
i
consider
it
a
deal
edit
think
it
came
out
of
my
fridge
a
little
too
cold
as
it
warmed
the
mouthfeel
thickened
up
just
a
little
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
became
more
pronounced
but
still
not
overbearing
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
octoberfest
being
nicely
balanced
and
featuring
tasty
malty
flavors
i
did
find
the
aftertaste
slightly
watery
but
that
wasnt
enough
to
make
me
want
to
skip
the
next
sip
this
beer
started
off
nicely
for
me
the
pour
was
a
very
nice
copper
color
just
like
a
good
octoberfest
beer
should
have
the
head
was
strong
and
last
a
little
while
the
aromas
of
spices
and
autumn
leaves
were
present
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
good
in
the
beginning
but
as
the
beer
warmed
up
it
started
getting
a
little
funky
on
me
not
sure
why
but
it
was
kind
of
gross
after
mid
bottle
not
sure
how
this
can
happen
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
either
way
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
i
would
give
this
another
try
if
im
ever
at
a
beer
fest
or
something
and
they
have
it
there
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
glass
pours
a
deep
copper
color
slightly
fluffy
white
head
that
coated
the
sides
of
the
glass
lots
of
sweetness
and
spices
in
the
aromawhich
is
mirrored
in
the
flavor
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
honey
are
the
main
components
complementing
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
very
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
the
spices
added
in
a
nice
marzen
but
nothing
really
sets
it
into
the
best
of
category
but
it
is
definitely
in
the
better
than
most
group
i
would
probably
have
enjoyed
this
more
during
the
fall
it
is
a
well
thought
out
beer
for
the
warm
days
and
chilly
nights
of
the
new
england
fall
days
nice
brownish
copper
color
to
accentuate
the
dying
colors
of
fall
liquid
is
pretty
opaque
and
doesnt
produce
much
head
or
leave
much
of
a
trail
taste
is
a
bitter
sweet
mostly
seems
like
pine
hops
and
some
roasted
malts
to
give
it
a
smoked
maple
syrup
flavor
easy
to
enjoy
as
the
sun
sets
to
remind
you
that
itll
be
cold
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
bitterness
of
fall
descends
on
you
d
smooth
enough
for
the
lighter
sided
folk
yet
robust
enough
to
satisfy
its
fall
beer
category
d
robust
with
lots
going
on
a
party
beer
that
seems
even
bigger
than
it
actually
is
plenty
of
flavor
in
a
very
fall
seasonal
way
but
it
seems
a
bit
rugged
for
a
marzen
the
nose
is
robustly
to
style
but
the
palate
is
less
than
lager
clean
still
very
drinkable
the
flavor
brings
some
nice
toasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
light
leafy
hopping
nice
light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
really
nice
hop
character
a
really
nice
rendition
of
an
american
octoberfest
and
one
i
quite
enjoyed
d
a
disappointing
effort
from
harpoon
on
this
one
a
definite
skip
that
could
be
a
maybe
with
more
love
in
the
malt
department
when
it
comes
to
a
decent
octoberfest
this
beer
is
kind
of
in
the
middle
of
the
bunch
it
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
nice
scent
of
spices
that
scream
octoberfest
it
has
a
slight
bitter
taste
that
full
of
spice
and
yet
smooth
to
drink
my
only
complaints
are
i
think
its
a
little
too
smooth
needing
more
texture
to
it
and
the
slight
after
taste
it
leaves
nice
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
with
a
nice
head
that
was
well
retained
smell
of
hops
is
noticed
which
is
different
nice
the
tastes
is
very
bready
and
malty
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
in
this
beer
that
stands
apart
from
other
oktoberfests
nicely
done
d
session
beer
great
with
the
octoberfest
foods
we
all
enjoy
taste
shows
a
nice
balance
of
various
flavors
of
malt
toast
nuts
sweet
grains
and
toffee
leafy
hops
clean
up
the
finish
decently
enough
very
smooth
drinker
with
a
nice
smooth
feeling
on
the
palate
i
am
impressed
with
this
harpoon
offering
plenty
of
flavor
i
cant
tell
if
this
is
an
ale
or
lager
with
the
full
body
and
moderate
fruitiness
seems
to
work
pretty
well
though
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
full
sixer
of
this
in
the
fridge
d
a
bit
heavy
for
this
style
not
as
drinkable
as
say
spatens
octoberfest
but
doable
certainly
american
like
i
alluded
to
above
the
body
is
too
full
for
my
liking
in
a
oktoberfest
that
affects
the
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
greatly
through
all
of
these
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
great
example
d
pretty
drinkable
maltforward
brew
this
is
so
much
better
in
a
bottle
than
on
tap
its
almost
like
a
different
beer
whereas
i
usually
think
of
harpoon
as
a
better
than
average
beer
and
a
good
hometown
tap
option
i
rarely
think
of
them
as
great
between
the
100
barrel
series
fankenfest
and
this
harpoon
seems
to
have
a
knack
for
the
octoberfest
style
overalldrinkability
not
too
shabby
of
a
beer
as
far
as
american
oktoberfest
beers
go
i
would
be
more
inclined
to
reach
for
the
sam
adams
oktoberfest
in
my
local
liquor
store
but
this
one
is
certainly
very
good
for
5
5
abv
i
sure
do
taste
the
alcohol
quite
a
bit
on
this
one
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
are
quite
nice
though
and
the
taste
still
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
within
this
style
category
but
also
not
my
least
favorite
d
drinkable
however
not
my
favorite
octoberfest
definitely
better
options
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
decline
one
if
offered
dark
mahogany
color
clear
but
with
little
head
and
that
fading
quickly
lightly
toasty
malts
make
up
most
of
the
nose
slightly
bready
flavor
is
solid
on
the
style
with
plenty
of
appropriate
malt
flavor
hops
are
given
a
light
touch
but
sufficient
to
dry
out
the
sweetness
especially
at
the
finish
which
is
none
too
sweet
excellent
body
not
heavy
but
full
smell
was
nuts
some
roasted
malts
hint
of
hops
but
nothing
too
strong
the
taste
was
the
same
it
almost
tasted
like
water
in
the
middle
with
some
nuts
up
front
and
what
tasted
like
a
berry
or
two
in
the
initial
landing
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
solid
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
overall
not
impressed
just
a
tad
too
watery
for
my
taste
pours
a
copper
flor
that
is
very
clear
and
has
some
reddish
hues
to
it
very
dark
for
the
style
pretty
1
finger
off
white
head
with
no
lacing
aroma
has
that
sweet
peanut
aroma
as
well
as
lager
yeasty
aromas
a
touch
of
sweetness
also
on
the
aroma
the
taste
is
really
below
average
has
a
vomit
taste
to
it
on
the
finish
metallic
and
off
balanced
really
tastes
like
crappy
amber
lager
from
a
crappy
d
excellent
i
had
this
one
after
two
sam
adams
octoberfests
an
octoberfest
that
i
like
a
lot
and
liked
it
better
went
down
real
easily
and
i
was
regretting
that
i
hadnt
seen
this
one
earlier
in
the
night
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
smooth
nutty
and
hoppy
flavor
it
isnt
strong
flavored
but
also
not
watery
this
beer
has
a
very
good
flavor
its
great
on
a
fall
night
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
less
carbonation
however
t
this
beer
has
a
malty
back
bone
but
good
very
good
octoberfest
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
again
an
ok
brew
but
i
have
had
better
of
this
type
so
far
the
weakest
harpoon
offering
i
have
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
others
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
light
at
that
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
for
the
style
leading
to
a
semidry
finish
certainly
a
drinkable
lager
and
a
good
beer
for
the
season
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
some
toffee
notes
it
smells
about
like
an
oktoberfest
should
smell
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
notes
of
toffee
and
grain
but
i
also
get
some
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
exciting
but
a
decent
beer
dmaybe
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
all
malt
this
is
what
october
is
all
about
quite
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
and
every
drop
would
be
as
good
as
the
first
there
are
much
better
october
themed
beers
out
there
long
trail
even
sam
adams
easy
drinker
and
tastes
so
refreshing
perfect
for
watching
the
autumn
swiftly
turn
the
colors
of
life
to
death
one
of
the
most
beautiful
acts
of
mother
nature
one
could
witness
a
dark
orangeamberred
body
topped
by
offwhite
creamy
head
smells
of
sweet
grain
caramel
toffee
slight
veggies
tastes
of
veggies
grains
a
sweet
note
of
sugar
corn
some
residual
sweetness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
light
in
body
and
in
carbonation
the
lingering
sweet
notes
offends
the
palate
a
bit
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
just
not
something
you
need
to
go
back
to
i
prefer
sams
octoberfest
a
little
making
my
way
though
this
seasons
octoberfest
offerings
and
then
will
be
able
to
rate
this
better
d
a
wildly
uneven
beer
not
undrinkable
just
average
dnot
too
bad
the
taste
stays
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
hint
of
fruitinessbanana
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
oktoberfest
style
will
definitely
try
this
again
if
i
see
it
this
season
pours
a
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
one
finger
head
quickly
dissipates
with
little
lacing
to
be
found
smell
is
less
than
impressive
a
bit
metallic
but
also
has
minor
bready
caramel
and
dark
fruit
aroma
taste
is
nice
nice
caramel
malt
to
start
breadyness
hints
of
toffee
and
dark
fruits
also
present
finishes
up
with
a
little
hit
of
crisp
tonguetingling
hops
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
creamy
which
turns
crisp
at
the
very
end
pours
a
clear
mahogany
body
with
two
fingers
of
frumpy
tan
head
up
top
with
good
retention
aromas
are
more
subdued
than
those
of
most
oktoberfests
and
are
one
dimensionally
toasty
flavors
are
a
bit
deeper
with
an
earthy
almost
tealike
bitterness
being
added
to
the
predominately
toasty
profile
medium
body
is
less
full
than
that
of
my
favorite
members
of
this
style
but
its
lingering
flavors
of
toast
and
tea
make
it
an
overall
pleasurable
beer
yay
oktoberfest
is
upon
us
the
american
renditions
of
this
malty
brew
is
hitting
the
shelves
in
full
force
harpoon
surprised
me
with
this
one
as
i
have
not
seen
this
style
by
them
in
past
years
poured
a
autumn
leaf
colored
amber
with
champange
like
fizzy
bubbles
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
healthy
aroma
of
caramel
malts
and
mango
like
fruitiness
the
tsate
was
silky
and
seductive
with
the
caramel
malts
jumping
out
front
then
fading
but
not
completely
away
into
a
spicey
hop
finish
with
some
mild
fruitiness
in
the
background
make
me
want
to
get
my
stein
toast
to
the
best
beer
party
around
either
way
a
great
marzen
d
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
i
can
defently
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
this
marzen
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
spot
on
but
the
other
components
miss
the
mark
for
the
style
at
a
time
then
there
are
a
multitude
of
seasonal
options
this
one
is
one
that
ill
avoid
in
the
future
d
very
drinkable
this
has
a
great
mix
of
flavor
and
feel
with
a
lowmedium
abv
making
it
perfect
drinkability
for
the
fall
days
prost
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
is
a
reddish
copper
color
crystal
clear
and
has
a
big
offwhite
head
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
the
first
whiff
smells
of
toasted
malt
sweet
malt
and
more
layers
of
toasted
barley
are
what
this
aroma
is
packing
the
first
sip
reveals
a
heavy
medium
body
all
that
toasted
malt
from
the
aroma
still
comes
through
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
toasted
whole
grain
rustic
bread
in
the
middle
and
an
almost
astringent
finish
that
isnt
harsh
or
off
putting
but
caught
me
off
guard
no
complaints
in
any
of
the
categories
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
beer
is
mildly
malty
pretty
bright
on
the
palate
its
mildly
fruity
almost
banana
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
good
and
its
highly
drinkable
its
a
simple
beer
not
much
to
write
about
the
fruitiness
in
the
midpalate
was
a
good
surprise
fun
d
a
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
but
not
what
the
style
should
be
missing
key
flavors
and
falls
short

best

maerzens
ive
had
thus
far

profile
isnt
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
german
versions
but
this
is
a
solid
example
overall
a
pleasant
beer
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
your
average
oktoberfest
which
will
be
a
plus
for
many
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
its
overall
dry
and
crisp

drinkability
its
a

beer
all
together
goes
down
well
but
is
quite
filling
a
six
pack
of
these
will
probably
last
me
a
week
its
not
a
beer
i
can
really
tackle

night
orangeamber

on

a
touch
of
caramel
on

that
fades
quickly
a
little
thin
on
the
body
with
some
fizziness
not
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
easy
to
drink
but
other
than

weak
in

d
very
easy
to
drink
this
oktoberfest
d
very
drinkable
settle
down
with
a
6
pack
and
enjoy
goes
somewhat
harsh
and
smoked
there
is
some
apple
quality
to
a
rather
solid
looking
beer
but
something
is
lob
sided
in
the
palate
its
a
tad
acidic
and
hard
on
the
stomach
smoke
and
carbonation
hurt
the
stomach
the
feel

coarse
a
bitter
finish
that
isnt
back
with
enough

quality
that
i
get
in

a
beer
that
does
it
initially
but
turns
in

overall
very
very
drinkable
worth
having
this
in
this
cask
form
and
now
im
spoiled
and
wont
drink
it
any
other
way
d
drinking
by
a
bonfire
a
6
pack
would
be
in
dangerous
territory
of
losing
its
life
quickly
very
tasty
harpoon
is
not
one
of
those
breweries
that
i
think
of
when
the
topic
turns
to
goodgreat
craft
beer
that
said
theyve
done
a
wonderful
job
with
octoberfest
what
a
pleasant
surprise
on
this
snowy
february
morning
drinkability
very
good
pours
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
nice
crisp
looking
clean
amber
with
a
generous
barely
off
white
soapy
head
it
has
a
nice
retention
and
a
good
solid
lacing
throughout
the
smell
is
mainly
of
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
clean
grain
with
a
bit
of
fleeting
floral
hops
and
citrus
rind
the
taste
is
of
grain
some
rye
bread
and
a
touch
of
herb
and
spice
the
flavor
is
a
bit
hard
to
pinpoint
with
mostly
grain
and
bread
flavors
with
some
light
caramel
malt
coming
through
and
being
followed
up
by
some
light
pleasant
hop
flavor
it
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
as
a
result
of
the
malt
presence
one
thing
i
noticed
as
the
beer
warmed
was
a
bit
of
an
off
flavor
a
bit
of
soap
and
some
unpleasant
pepper
the
former
could
have
been
a
result
of
a
bad
bottle
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
excluding
the
off
taste
it
was
a
successful
attempt
at
the
traditional
german
style
in
terms
of
color
and
aroma
but
the
taste
was
a
little
lacking
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
sessionable
beer
has
some
good
fall
taste
like
a
very
subtle
pumpkin
ale
but
it
needs
to
make
up
its
mind
about
what
style
it
is
and
stick
to
it
had
the
first
taste
this
year
at
the
harpoon
oktoberfest
in
vermont
then
had
it
a
willimantic
brewery
both
times
it
was
consistently
a
good
beer
good
amber
color
not
overly
spicy
or
pumpkin
flavored
finishes
well
without
any
overbearing
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
satisfying
beer
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
seasonal
beer
very
different
from
a
true
oktoberfest
bier
but
a
unique
and
creative
fall
drink
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
expected
a
maerzen
but
ended
up
with
a
red
ale
not
too
shabby
a
clear
but
radiant
copper
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
similar
lacing
to
go
with
it
the
aroma
brings
malty
raisin
and
fruity
banana
bubblegum
in
quite
a
snootful
of
flowery
goodness
the
flavor
follows
with
a
much
more
earthy
peppery
grain
malt
that
bites
the
tongue
with
quite
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
and
a
hint
of
dry
alcohol
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
leaving
behind
a
little
more
of
that
raisinprune
kiss
over
caramel
wheat
and
its
hard
to
lose
that
interesting
banana
touch
its
on
the
thin
crisp
side
but
appropriately
for
the
style
i
think
this
is
pretty
neat
not
sure
everyone
will
embrace
it
but
it
has
basic
octoberfest
qualities
while
delivering
some
subtle
complexities
with
nice
bitterness
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
again
gladly
12
oz
descently
solid
amber
pour
some
white
head
some
sweet
malt
and
autumn
leaf
aromas
pleasant
lightmid
body
good
malt
flavor
with
a
little
herbal
tea
and
pinecitrus
hops
more
piney
than
citrus
a
good
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
probably
wont
seek
out
but
definetely
would
not
turn
away
one
either
descent
session
beer
from
harpoon
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
down
but
would
i
really
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
it
really
comes
down
to
a
preference
issue
for
me
im
not
the
biggest
red
ale
fan
so
i
suppose
it
might
get
knocked
a
little
for
that
however
very
good
for
its
style
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
really
good
for
the
season
a
bit
darker
than
even
most
american
ofests
this
was
a
deep
copperamber
or
reddish
brown
decent
offwhite
head
caramelly
bready
nutty
malts
in
the
nose
taste
follows
with
the
lightly
sweet
malts
wellbalanced
by
the
underlying
smooth
hop
bitterness
lightmed
bodied
crisp
finish
frothy
mouthfeel
sessionable
and
overall
quite
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
tasty
flavors
not
my
favorite
harpoon
offering
or
octoberfest
for
that
matter
but
still
solid
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
can
work
on
you
over
time
but
otherwise
very
nice
d
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
so
far
well
done
i
have
been
sampling
a
lot
of
octoberfests
lately
unforutnaley
i
havent
been
reviewing
all
of
them
this
particular
octoberfest
had
a
very
rich
amber
reddish
hue
minimal
lace
and
head
the
beer
did
not
have
a
prevalent
smell
sort
of
weak
thankfully
the
beer
taste
was
pretty
good
i
had
a
nice
carmel
malt
with
overtones
of
cinnomon
and
spices
tasted
like
a
crips
autum
morining
the
mouthfeel
was
average
some
enjoyable
tingles
on
the
tounge
overall
a
decent
beer
i
have
had
much
better
octoberfests
this
year
but
this
beer
dosent
stand
out
i
would
consider
it
the
median
a
wonderfully
thick
head
sits
on
top
of
an
incredibly
amber
colored
beer
my
favorite
look
easily
the
head
fades
away
very
very
slowly
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavoring
accentuates
the
taste
but
im
a
bit
disappointed
on
the
smell
nothing
really
stands
out
taste
wise
its
pretty
good
nothing
overbearing
typical
octoberfest
beer
taste
in
the
style
of
american
amber
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
about
what
you
want
out
of
a
octoberfest
heavy
but
drinkable
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
a
bit
sweet
the
taste
follows
the
finish
lingers
a
bit
and
is
drying
the
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
and
quite
sessionable
i
prefer
other
fest
beers
but
it
is
not
bad
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
december
15
2009
sampled
on
october
11
2009
it
pours
a
mahoganyamber
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
clarity
is
pretty
nice
on
it
the
mouthfeel
feels
fairly
bold
tastewise
it
has
many
of
the
elements
of
a
decent
esb
with
a
malty
raisinlike
flavor
as
well
theres
a
dryer
finish
that
leaves
a
little
aftertaste
i
would
say
taht
overall
this
is
a
mild
and
comfortable
beer
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
solid
oktoberfest
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
one
ill
probably
come
back
to
again
drinkability
not
a
traditional
octoberfest
style
but
still
a
damn
good
beer
perfectly
balanced
and
very
sessionable
it
is
very
satisfying
definitely
worth
a
try
great
representation
of
a
traditional
octfest
not
anything
id
seek
out
but
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
taste
is
where
it
is
at
for
me
with
this
brew
this
brew
is
hoppy
and
malty
the
balance
is
very
nice
very
drinkable
although
this
is
not
a
true
octoberfest
it
is
very
good
for
this
time
of
year
however
the
beer
lacks
adequate
carbonation
and
has
no
head
in
fact
it
reminded
me
of
a
homebrew
that
was
only
primed
for
a
few
days
flat
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
it
really
lacks
proper
carbonation
could
have
been
a
great
beer
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
have
a
problem
with
octoberfests
if
you
like
them
im
not
the
best
person
to
read
a
review
from
theyre
stronger
and
heavier
than
an
amber
lager
or
pilsner
but
not
wintery
intense
like
a
bock
maibock
etc
its
not
so
spicy
that
its
like
a
winter
ale
but
not
clean
enough
to
drink
without
noticing
this
beer
was
typical
for
an
octoberfest
but
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
that
said
i
like
a
lot
of
beers
from
this
brewery
so
if
you
like
octoberfest
try
this
one
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
it
has
a
nice
flavor
that
doesnt
get
tiresome
not
too
heavy
decent
session
beer
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
even
though
this
is
not
a
true
octoberfest
beer
it
is
still
really
good
and
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
i
like
this
beer
pretty
good
across
the
board
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
nice
amber
red
color
with
perfect
clarity
to
it
it
has
a
nice
orangy
cream
colored
head
with
many
different
size
bubbles
to
it
it
goes
away
pretty
quickly
and
there
really
isnt
much
lacing
to
it
pretty
nice
aroma
very
malty
a
bit
of
roast
to
it
almost
kind
of
a
hop
aftersmell
if
that
makes
sense
the
taste
is
very
good
well
balanced
mostly
roasted
malts
has
a
nice
finish
slightly
bitter
good
mouthfeel
id
consider
it
full
bodied
the
drinkability
is
good
i
gotta
say
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
for
an
oktoberfest
but
still
a
nice
heavy
ale
a
very
nice
fall
beverage
this
is
a
tough
review
for
me
i
wish
this
beer
tasted
more
like
the
aroma
indicated
it
might
the
aftertaste
from
this
beer
is
not
something
that
i
care
for
im
not
a
big
fan
of
an
alcohol
taste
to
my
beer
either
and
this
beer
has
more
than
id
like
especially
for
the
style
buy
again
possibly
i
dont
usually
drink
lager
like
beers
and
there
are
better
beers
in
this
style
but
it
is
a
good
drinking
beer
prosit
harpoon
octoberfest
has
a
clean
malty
taste
a
clear
copper
color
and
a
slightly
hoppy
aroma
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
drinkable
octoberfest
that
is
not
too
overpowering
with
a
sulfur
smelling
lager
yeast
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
on
the
market
this
year
a
nice
brew
overall
readily
available
at
most
decent
package
stores
this
will
surely
be
a
fall
standby
for
me
d
definitely
a
robust
oktoberfest
from
harpoon
malty
but
a
bit
overshadowed
by
hop
bitterness
rather
than
the
hop
spiciness
the
style
is
known
for
an
interesting
interpretation
drinkability
suffers
slightly
because
its
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
overall
a
pretty
nice
fall
seasonal
taste
hops
and
toasty
malt
are
in
balance
supremely
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
than
a
single
bottle
of
the
stuff
taste
is
a
bit
bitterhoppy
slightly
carbonated
not
sweet
but
still
malty
body
is
very
light
and
smooth
its
pleasant
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
pretty
close
for
an
ale
but
as
an
amber
ale
theres
nothing
really
unique
about
this
other
then
its
level
of
malt
a
fitting
seasonal
ale
but
pretty
average
overall
a
very
drinkable
american
red
ale
drinkability
overall
i
love
the
effort
harpoon
did
with
this
beer
its
got
very
good
balance
and
isnt
too
overmalted
like
some
other
offerings
ive
had
the
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
it
easier
to
drink
then
some
other
octobers
on
the
shelf
and
the
hop
flavors
kept
me
interested
throughout
ill
definetley
pick
this
up
again
when
probably
the
driest
amber
ale
ive
ever
had
usually
not
a
bad
thing
i
like
dry
beers
but
this
was
too
much
there
needs
to
be
a
little
sweetness
there
to
bring
it
to
life
shouldnt
be
called
an
octoberfest
and
wouldnt
try
again
must
try
hey
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
thank
you
harpoon
for
helping
me
to
enjoy
this
style
the
body
of
this
beer
is
very
comparable
to
most
oktoberfests
it
comes
across
as
a
maltier
lager
however
i
find
this
beer
more
drinkable
than
most
oktoberfests
due
to
the
nice
addition
of
the
roastedchocolate
malts
the
roastiness
cuts
down
on
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
oktoberfest
nice
work
harpoon
this
is
perhaps
the
best
octoberfest
i
have
tried
next
to
paulaner
i
highly
recommend
it
as
ive
found
many
american
offerings
of
this
style
to
be
a
letdown
now
i
understand
why
someone
before
me
nearly
bought
the
store
out
of
this
beer
well
done
harpoon
overall
i
would
have
to
say
its
a
pretty
good
oktoberfest
brew
still
curious
on
the
great
lakes
beats
the
bells
i
love
the
mix
of
different
hop
flavors
in
one
beer
had
samuel
adams
octoberfest
so
decided
to
try
harpoon
another
local
brewer
have
to
say
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
this
octoberfest
than
sams
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
that
mixes
well
with
food
and
just
fine
to
sit
back
watching
a
game
main
reason
for
love
of
this
beer
is
that
the
after
taste
is
none
most
octorberfests
leave
behind
numerous
traces
of
flavor
that
many
people
dont
appreciate
this
is
an
excellant
beer
and
definitly
would
recommend
to
others
too
bad
its
only
out
for
2
months
12
oz
brown
bottle

a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
about
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
that
is
slowly
dissipating
and
leaving
some
nice
lacing
scents
of
malt
and
spices
hit
the
nose
hops
immediately
play
on
the
taste
buds
with
some
spice
and
malt
undertones
light
carbonation
and
a
relatively
easy
drinker
definitely
a
staple
in
the
autumnoktoberfest
game
here
in
new
england
time
tested
for
sure
this
is
a
good
one
for
sure
totally
solid
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
over
the
coarse
of
a
fall
evening
t
very
smooth
the
malts
tame
the
bitterness
there
was
even
a
slight
fruitiness
to
it
as
far
as
american
octoberfests
go
this
is
a
solid
entry
better
than
most
us

a
12

the

a
hazed
golden
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
foam
aroma
and
flavor
consist
of
medium
toasted
grain
bready
malt
grassy
hops
caramel
and
toffee
slightly
thin
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
orange
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
pretty
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
with
faint
peppery
hop
notes
tastes
rich
and
well
balanced
for
the
style
with
caramel
malt
and
tobacco
flavors
leading
the
way
into
a
leafy
almost
minty
hop
finish
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
the
better
american
fest
beers
imo
drinkability
i
cant
say
this
is
near
as
drinkable
as
my
erdinger
oktoberfestweizen
or
even
my
balto
marzhon
same
goes
for
my
paulaner
oktoberfest
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
love
this
it
totally
missed
the
mark
in
the
end
sorry
harpoon
perhaps
next
time
ohio
can
get
some
fresher
product
d
easy
to
drink
but
quite
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
as
stated
earlier
i
dont
know
harpoons
intentions
but
either
way
this
is
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
american
marzen
or
a
dime
a
dozen
amber
end
bitterness
doesnt
help
much
either
drinkability
a
perfectly
acceptable
octoberfest
that
will
appeal
to
most
palates
i
could
have
a
six
but
will
most
likely
search
for
something
else
i
would
prefer
this
over
sam
adams
octoberfest
also
like
to
suppose
local
brewerys
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
that
did
a
good
job
of
complimenting
each
other
and
making
the
beer
nice
to
drink
the
smooth
and
roasted
malt
taste
made
for
a
fairly
representable
oktoberfest

this
beer
i
sampled
is
infact
best
drank
by
22008
but
the
taste
has
still
held
up
it
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
right
after
the
initial
sip
i
am
more
of
an
avid
sam
adams
octoberfest
drinker
but
after
sampling
this
post
best
drink
by
date
i
will
only
hope
a
fresh
brew
taste
just
as
good
a
pretty
decent
octoberfest
overall
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
easy
to
put
down
md
slightly
overcarbonated
for
me
a
little
too
earthy
and
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
alot

drinking
this
while
watching
the

a
slightly
dry

some
floral

medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
sweet
and
balanced
with
a
nice
crisp
dry

easy
to

but
i
was
a
little
thrown
off
at
first
since
its
not
an
oktoberfestmarzen
as
the
name
would
suggest
once
you
get
past
that
fact
its
a
good
brew
worth
picking
up
again
i
will
buy
this
again
the
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
some
florals
mixed
in
a
rather
sweetish
malty
beer
with
an
old
english
ale
feel
to
it
there
isnt
much
of
the
roasted
or
peaty
quality
typical
of
red
ales
but
this
is
an
amber
ale
with
some
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
some
course
graininess
and
a
nice
mid
bodied
firmness
to
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
even
though
it
isnt
really
a
marzan
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
medium
amber

with
orange
hues
and
a
one
finger
off
white

of

quickly
with
little

carmelized

the

carmelized

toasted

flavors
up

flavors
in
the
middle

with
the

ending
with
a
dry
chocolate
finish
medium
high
carbonation
medium
body
this
is
a
mouth
cleansing
beer
that
demands
another
sip
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
the
best
for
the
style
the
hops
seem
out
of
place
served
at
45
degrees
poured
into

and
drank
from

good
redbrown

fairly
clear
mild
sweet

very
little
depth
in
the

flavor
with
strong
hoppy
finish
midly
bitter
fairly
drinkable
woulda
enjoy
more
if
not
as
hoppy
in
the
finish
but
seems
to
be
the
harpoon
mo
enjoy
life
is
too
short
for
bad
beer
notes
well
done
this
is
a
great
oktoberfestamber
ale
brewed
with
ale
yeast
instead
of
traditional
lager
yeast
not
crazy
about
this
particular
octoberfest
but
i
can
see
how
some
would
like
it
this
is
a
good
autumn
beer
that
said
its
really
not
a
good
octoberfest
as
its
more
of
a
red
ale
but
still
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
cooler
months
the
feel
is
thick
and
milky
remains
for
a
bit
after
the
swallow
its
a
good
bittersweet
brew
strong
and
flavorful
an
earthy
autumnal
beer
overall
its
an
okay
beer
and
certainly
sessionable
as
its
quite
light
doesnt
wow
me
and
probably
wont
get
again
unless
its
the
best
option
on
the
table
this
poured
a
dark
clear
auburn
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
barley
and
caramel
malt
with
light
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
earthy
barley
malt
with
rusty
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
clean
and
drinkable
but
it
wasnt
the
most
rewarding
flavor
it
was
still
a
nice
simple
refreshing
beer
pours
a
copper
body
with
auburnamber
hues
mixed
in
and
onefinger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
minor
lacing
decent
sweet
malt
smell
of
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
really
smooth
medium
body
and
while
a
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
is
overly
present
there
is
not
much
else
than
that
as
the
hops
and
spices
are
light
a
tad
letdown
from
having
had
other
harpoon
brews
blow
me
away
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
so
hard
still
a
good
october
brew
and
definitely
sessionable
d
i
would
say
this
is
highly
drinkable
especially
with
the
autumnal
weather
here
in
new
england
but
for
me
personally
im
more
likely
to
seek
out
a
pumpkin
or
a
harvest
a
notch
below
average
for
this
octoberfest
from
a
brewery
which
hasnt
really
let
me
down
yet
this
one
is
too
undercarbonated
and
suffers
from
this
flatness
along
with
being
a
tad
too
thin
and
watery
tastewise
it
is
missing
out
on
some
things
also
i
must
say
ive
had
some
worse
octoberfests
but
ive
had
much
better
ones
too
try
out
hookers
or
brooklyns
instead
if
youre
in
the
new
england
area
d
overall
im
very
pleased
again
my
latest
octoberfests
have
only
been
soso
but
this
is
a
hit
way
to
go
harpoon
pretty
drinkable
a
good
beer
overall
watching
football
at
mckees
it
was
time
to
review
another
brew
off
their
tap
this
beer
was
a
dark
copper
color
with
some
reddishrust
hues
the
head
was
off
white
fluffy
and
laced
in
spurts
the
aroma
was
mostly
malt
and
grains
roasted
corn
as
per
at
a
state
fair
and
some
caramel
with
hints
of
spice
the
taste
was
very
maltcentered
earthy
grain
dry
malt
caramel
malt
and
a
roastedtoasted
character
towards
the
end
some
herbaceous
woody
hops
kicked
in
which
helped
to
balance
it
the
mouthfeel
was
average
though
i
think
it
was
a
little
overcarbonated
and
underbodied
for
the
style
still
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
offering
d
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
and
one
that
i
could
definitely
drink
again
d
nice
interpretation
of
the
octoberfest
season
always
a
winner
here
in
boston
drinkability
a
very
good
american
octoberfest
beer
this
one
hits
the
spot
this
beer
is
strange
as
it
seems
to
say
too
smooth
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
life
and
edge
to
bring
out
the
spice
the
woodiness
on
the
finish
alone
however
makes
this
an
interesting
beer
to
try
d
all
around
a
good
beer
a
fantastic
seasonal
brew
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
octoberfests
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
unremarkable
an
ok
octoberfest
but
not
exceptional
a
sour
and
somewhat
bitter
smell
to
start
off
contrary
to
what
others
have
said
the
usual
appearance
for
this
style
and
the
taste
improved
as
it
warmed
a
little
too
carbonated
but
not
a
bad
beer
although
underwhelming
from
a
brewery
that
uniformly
produces
a
great
product
this
beer
pours
a
coppery
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
slight
lacing
throughout
the
beer
there
are
faint
hints
of
hops
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
the
flavor
is
full
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
balance
medium
bodied
yet
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
this
is
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
that
i
have
tasted
so
far
the
aroma
is
wonderful
spicy
malty
crisp
and
inviting
fizzy
mouthfeel
conveys
an
extremely
crisp
and
dry
brew
with
a
long
tartly
bitter
finish
complexity
of
taste
lags
behind
hat
lovely
aroma
but
the
overall
effect
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
well
done
easily
drinkable
however
pours
a
very
nice
copperred
color
with
glints
of
garnet
when
the
light
hits
as
well
as
having
some
very
nice
head
and
good
lacing
nice
scent
very
malty
and
almost
deep
but
not
as
strong
as
it
could
be
it
has
a
very
nice
deep
earthy
malt
flavor
a
nice
redtype
lager
with
a
very
nice
pilsnerlike
peppery
finish
it
goes
down
fine
but
isnt
the
smoothest
of
beers
an
excellent
marzen
overall
id
say
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
departures
from
the
typical
octoberfest
d
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
german
style
oktoberfest
so
this
was
ok
but
not
great
solid
beer
though
d
tis
the
start
of
the
season
for
octoberfests
and
pumpkins
this
is
a
good
standard
octoberfest
that
is
very
sessionable
harpoon
did
well
with
the
brewing
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
of
good
carbonation
and
creamy
consistancy
extremely
sessionable
drinks
very
nice
just
finished
off
a
12
oz
bottle
and
found
this
beer
to
be
very
refreshing
it
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
perfect
head
the
lacing
lasted
throughout
the
entire
glass
nice
aroma
with
an
intial
subdued
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
excellent
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
makes
me
want
another
drinkability
is
excellent
and
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
this
winter
poured
a
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
some
toasted
caramel
malt
taste
was
also
nice
caramel
malt
with
very
subdued
hops
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
easydrinking
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
out
there
easy
to
drink
and
makes
you
want
more
as
i
mentioned
a
good
oktoberfest
session
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
have
not
had
this
before
12
oz
sampled
2
days
before
the
bestby
date
of
121307
it
pours
an
almost
lifeless
crystalclear
dark
amber
hue
with
low
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
khaki
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
toasted
and
sweetish
malts
in
the
nose
with
a
dash
of
hops
and
bubblegum
on
the
palate
its
caramel
and
toasted
malts
leafy
hops
that
impart
a
medium
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
bubblegum
the
body
is
medium
and
quite
dry
with
moderate
carbonation
and
finish
overall
the
beer
is
too
dry
with
the
hops
too
prevalent
and
the
malts
not
sweet
enough
to
make
it
balanced
and
hence
heavily
drinkable
the
way
octoberfests
are
supposed
to
be
average
at
best
im
a
huge
fan
of
octoberfests
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
sweet
malty
marzens
that
i
look
forward
to
every
fall
harpoon
octoberfest
pours
a
clear
redamber
with
a
foamy
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
malty
with
tons
of
caramel
and
some
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
toasted
character
there
is
a
little
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
or
aroma
im
not
always
a
big
fan
of
octoberfest
beers
but
i
like
this
one
a
nice
nutty
nose
that
leads
into
a
bitterness
that
doesnt
disappoint
with
a
sharp
finish
octoberfest
has
never
been
my
preferred
style
but
this
offering
is
quite
quaffable
and
fun
to
try
good
work
overall
drinkability
a
real
good
octoberfest
brew
would
buy
again
if
i
could
find
some
will
wait
til
next
year
i
was
surprised
to
see
an
octoberfest
beer
still
on
the
market
close
to
midnovember
sam
adams
is
almost
always
completely
sold
out
by
midoctober
i
realized
why
this
beer
was
still
around
for
so
long
the
appearance
was
nice
and
it
had
a
good
smell
however
this
beer
has
very
little
taste
and
none
of
the
great
malt
taste
that
octoberfest
usually
have
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
me
and
i
couldnt
finish
the
beer
the
taste
was
a
little
like
dirt
and
i
think
it
made
me
sick
not
difficult
to
drink
just
nothing
noteworthy
about
it
boring
bland
city
d
i
figured
this
would
be
a
good
nod
to
the
end
of
october
as
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
harpoon
a
lot
around
this
time
last
year
while
it
excels
in
mouthfeel
its
taste
is
above
average
but
the
balance
in
the
taste
works
well
id
say
this
is
a
great
way
to
say
farewell
to
the
month
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
thick
creamy
off
white
2
finger
head
smell
is
of
grains
corn
sweet
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
a
dried
fruit
aroma
taste
is
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
more
dried
fruits
coming
through
strong
carbonation
on
this
one
makes
it
a
crisp
drink
very
nice
octoberfest
beer
surprising
more
woody
and
resinous
than
expected
for
an
octoberfest
but
still
a
tasty
rich
brew
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
while
watching
sunday
football
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
fact
i
like
it
better
than
most
traditional
oktoberfests
why
do
they
even
bother
calling
it
oktoberfest
must
be
so
people
will
buy
it
during
the
fall
who
knows
anyway
nicely
done
all
around
a
good
beer
a
fantastic
seasonal
brew
d
quite
drinkable
id
say
i
wish
i
had
purchased
more
than
a
single
for
i
am
unsure
if
i
can
do
this
justice
by
only
consuming
one
very
nice
and
drinkable
but
i
dont
really
know
if
it
fits
the
style
as
well
as
others
a
beautiful
redamber
color
medium
slightly
tan
head
that
fades
to
moderate
sized
bubbles
lots
of
visible
carbonation
good
lagerlike
smell
although
i
see
this
is
an
ale
slightly
nutty
subtle
all
in
all
the
very
first
taste
was
surprisingly
of
chocolate
caramel
and
slight
roast
but
that
was
quickly
replaced
by
the
more
typical
but
very
full
and
malty
deliciousness
that
was
to
be
expected
a
nice
balance
of
malt
that
does
still
predominate
and
tasteful
hopping
that
provides
a
bit
of
crisp
spice
very
clean
and
drinkable
occasional
candysugarlike
and
green
grape
and
plum
notes
some
sulfur
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
sometimes
just
on
the
unpleasant
side
of
bitter
with
some
salt
as
well
overall
an
artful
brew
by
harpoon
this
beer
is
definatly
not
a
traditional
oktoberfest
which
is
probably
why
its
listed
at
an
american
amberred
ale
not
too
bad
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
just
kind
of
an
average
beer
like
a
lot
of
harpoon
beers
this
is
very
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
a
solid
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
an
americanized
oktoberfest
worth
your
time
overall
i
was
very
much
impressed
and
thought
this
one
was
really
fantastic
one
of
the
easiest
drinkers
i
have
seen
and
something
that
just
really
grabbed
a
hold
and
would
not
expect
it
to
very
refreshing
and
light
but
with
enough
flavor
and
spice
to
keep
your
interest
really
one
of
my
more
favorite
of
the
season
and
something
i
will
definitely
have
to
turn
to
again
next
year
really
nice
and
very
much
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
oktoberfest
that
fits
the
style
well
while
adding
a
couple
of
american
tweaks
beautiful
appearance
deep
red
and
perfect
for
fall
nice
creamy
head
but
thats
where
the
beauty
ends
not
a
true
oktoberfest
brew
more
of
a
pale
ale
since
its
a
tad
too
hoppy
and
not
malty
enough
at
first
you
get
the
caramel
malts
then
all
hops
not
my
favorite
ofest
at
all
but
if
you
can
try
one
for
free
as
i
did
do
it
not
recommended
for
the
season
though
unless
youre
a
hophead
and
love
pale
ales
then
youll
like
harpoons
take
on
an
oktoberfest
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
happy
oktoberfest
prost
too
drinkability
not
really
what
i
expect
from
the
style
but
still
a
tasty
lil
beer
none
the
less
d
impressive
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
well
worth
a
try
i
like
the
way
it
looks
dark
carmel
color
and
so
on
it
smells
pretty
hoppy
and
the
taste
reflects
the
same
thing
its
pretty
hoppy
and
bitter
this
tastes
more
like
an
ale
or
even
an
ipa
than
an
oktoberfest
brew
i
expected
roasted
malt
and
little
hops
and
got
the
complete
opposite
i
like
other
oktoberfest
beers
such
as
sam
adams
much
better
nothing
spectactular
here
but
that
could
be
the
beauty
of
harpoon
every
year
they
consistently
come
out
with
good
seasonals
and
the
occasional
specialty
the
octoberfest
pours
the
usual
amber
color
and
the
aroma
is
very
slight
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
very
smooth
for
an
octoberfest
still
every
year
when
i
try
my
first
octoberfest
i
am
really
only
counting
down
until
my
first
winter
pours
with
a
slight
head
that
dissipated
quickly
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
remained
throughout
the
serving

smell
with

of

sweet
malty
taste
tingle
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
slight
alcohol
taste
at
the
finish
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
seasonal
brew
looking
forward
to
octoberfest
at
the
brewery
columbus
day
weekend
overall
an
excellent
brew
even
if
its
not
a
true
oktoberfest
its
an
ale
not
a
lager
the
malt
and
hop
characters
compliment
each
other
very
nicely
i
know
harpoon
likes
to
put
their
own
twist
on
everythign
they
do
but
the
traditionalist
in
me
wishes
they
made
this
one
a
lager
still
i
found
this
one
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommend
it
overall
much
better
second
time
around
another
good
octoberfest
beer
boy
its
good
living
on
the
east
coast
when
autumn
rolls
around
this
is
one
drinkable
brew
and
a
great
fall
beer
i
can
easily
see
myself
kicking
back
and
drinking
several
of
these
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
as
a
nice
oktoberfest
or
fall
beer
got
a
sixpack
of
these
at
shorline
beverage
in
huntington
ny
for
7
99
a
great
price
for
such
a
tasty
beer
the
apperance
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
white
foamy
head
that
stays
pretty
consistent
throughout
leaving
slight
traces
of
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
the
taste
is
also
predominantly
of
malts
with
a
nice
little
kick
to
it
you
can
also
sense
a
touch
of
barley
and
cinammon
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
choice
for
those
who
dont
love
darker
beers
but
want
to
try
something
different
for
the
fallwinter
season
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
a
really
good
seasonal
even
though
its
not
true
to
the
style
lately
i
have
been
going
a
little
lager
crazy
so
this
being
a
pretty
new
release
figured
i
should
pick
some
up
poured
in
to
a
samuel
smith
pint
glass
a
copper
color
with
a
large
rocky
white
head
smells
included
chocolate
malt
honey
cinnamon
toasted
bread
and
caramel
taste
had
lots
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
also
maintained
that
lager
flavor
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heavy
side
although
for
this
style
was
lighter
than
some
of
the
others
i
have
tasted
with
that
being
said
that
might
be
the
reason
that
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
octoberfest
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
the
site
calls
it
a
red
ale
in
that
it
tastes
very
much
like
a
lager
to
me
anyway
this
is
one
of
the
best
seasonal
releases
from
harpoon
in
my
opinion
i
will
make
a
point
of
getting
more
of
this
brew
once
the
weather
gets
a
tad
bit
colder

a

definitely
a

up
from
the

i
actually
tried
this
one
on

im
wondering
what
this

would
be
like
fresher
recommended
pours
a
pale
orangeamber
with
very
good

two
and
a
half
finger
head
drops
to
a
dense

and
holds
well
leaving
abundant
spotty
lacing
toasty
aromas
and
munich
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
german
hops
toasted
pale

and
background
nutty
flavor
like
victory

followed
by
a
faint
munich
sweetness
semidry
aftertaste
timid
fruitiness
and
benign
german
hop
flavor
the
balance
is
deadon
but
the
total
flavor
seems
alltogether
mild
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
allow
the
dextrins
to
form
a
pleasent
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
with
terrific
drinkability
certainly
a
wellmade
beer
but
a
little
underwhelming
for
my
tastes
this
tastes
like
yearold
samuel
adams
octoberfest
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
the
fresher
sa
oct
tends
to
have
a
slight
hop
zing
which
bites
into
the
candycravers
sweet
tooth
share
of
golden
electric
sugar
more
evident
in
the
past

yeah
im
recommending
that
you
let
your
sa
oct
expire
and
sit
a
year
before
drinking
harpoons
okt
is
so
similar
to
that
aged
afforementioned

that
i
could
probably
blindtest
and
think
them
the
same
or
at

interchangeable

certainly
have
another
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
brew
staple
new

seasonal
session
brew
in
my

better
on

than
in

this
is
an
easy
drinking
autumn
ale
it
isnt
quite
the
same
as
a
traditional
oktoberfest

as
an
american
autumn
ale
it
hits
the
mark

then
some
easy

the
mouthfeel
was
good
this
is

fairly
uncomplicated

to
enjoy
this
with
some
warm

an

much
strays
far
from
the

have

plenty

hops
sugar
and
apricot
seemed
to
come
out
nicely
the
various
flavors
worked
very
well
together
in
fact
its
as
if
this
beer
has
taken
on
characteristics
of
different
styles
one
after
another
crisp
and
airy
with
a
light
body
like
a
kolsch
with
a
fruity
center
and
a

taste

alcohol
like
a
maibock
with
the
roastedsweet
flavors
and
slightly
chewy
texture
of
an
amber
or
brown
ale

this
was
a
very

have
with

also
kind

cheesy
and
metallic
the
finish

doesnt

me
wanting
another

is
this
a

the

robust
but
not
sludgy
this
beer
strikes
me
as
a
big
improvement
from
harpoons
past
octoberfest
beers
whether
thats
true
or
not
who
knows
but
this
is
certainly
a
worthy
american
octoberfest
style
brew
this
is
a
classic
easy
drinking
octoberfest
release
cheers
d
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
it
is
easily
drinkable
i
had
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
they
seem
to
get
worse
the
more
i
had
im
very
disappointed
in
harpoons
efforts
though
this
is
probably
the
best
that
ive
had
by
them
the
smell
is
much
better
than
the
taste
easily
drinkable
any
time
of
year
not
ultramindblowing
but
a
nice
malty
beer
with
adequate
balancing
bitterness
no
matter
what
style
you
want
to
call
it
im
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
flavor
in
harpoon
lately
and
this
is
no
exception
perhaps
they
are
trying
to
lighten
the
taste
to
broaden
their
mass
appeal
this
is
a
decent
oktoberfest
that
does
nothing
extraordinary
d
yeah
id
have
another
its
not
as
spicy
an
oktoberfest
as
i
might
ordinarily
crave
but
its
well
puttogether
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
sure
why
the
brewers
would
call
this
an
oktoberfest
beer
a
picked
up
a
sixpack
from
our
beer
store
down
the
street
to
celebrate
the
upcoming
festivities
we
decided
to
drink
it
from
our
steins
so
i
am
only
guessing
the
appearance
was
good
from
the
top
of
the
stein
it
appeared
a
nice
dark
amber
characteristic
of
a
märzen
aroma
was
mostly
malt
not
much
hop
quite
bready
the
taste
is
much
the
same
i
am
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
brew
but
i
was
pleased
with
the
overall
character
and
drinkability
a
solid
brew
is
it
just
me
or
do
harpoons
standard
offerings
seem
just
marginal
an
opportunity
to
shine
with
an
oktoberfest
even
falls
short
initially
shows
promise
with
a
bright
golden
orange
hue
and
a
standard
eggshell
white
though
it
laces
well
the
head
retention
flattens
quickly
nice
bready
caramelly
aromas
with
a
touch
of
hop
spiciness
intial
flavors
start
off
reaffirming
what
the
nose
held
but
quickly
disolves
into
a
water
brew
allowing
a
serious
grainy
bite
to
control
from
the
midpoint
on
grain
husk
and
bite
is
all
i
taste
and
feel
what
should
be
moderately
rich
bready
and
sweet
winds
up
tasting
like
wet
grain
a
malt
forward
oktoberfest
a
very
dry
finish
that
lasts
a
good
while
slightly
to
much
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
i
prefer
a
oktoberfest
with
more
rs
than
this
one
this
is
bone
dry
and
it
really
hurts
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
me
its
hard
to
seperate
this
oktoberfest
from
others
a
nice
amber
color
and
full
of
flavor
by
far
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
youll
ever
have
it
wasnt
special
though
feeling
almost
like
a
macro
at
times
sitting
outside
on
a
nice
fall
day
this
beer
is
an
excellent
compliment
to
the
chilly
but
comfortable
weather
even
served
ultracold
harpoon
oktoberfest
is
not
bad
it
is
not
great
either
i
feel
it
comes
up
a
little
short
in
taste
although
the
taste
has
the
slight
classic
caramel
slight
hops
in
it
not
nearly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
not
the
greatest
i
definitely
will
give
it
another
wing
but
for
now
just
an
average
marzen
last
swigs
coper
penny
metalic
and
flour
not
impressive
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
case
oh
well
overall
a
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
session
beer
simple
big
clean
malts
with
a
hop
taste
and
bitterness
just
big
enough
to
support
it
just
a
good
drinkable
beer
fairly
typical
octoberfest
smell
and
taste
to
it
marzen
hops
are
prevelant
with
hints
of
caramel
oatmeal
malt
and
a
windy
fall
day
all
bundled
up
in
the
bouquet
never
saw
a
fall
beer
like
this
categorzied
as
a
red
ale
but
a
bit
spicier
than
a
typical
red
and
darker
and
more
pronounced
than
an
amber
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
deeper
and
less
watery
but
this
is
not
a
bad
octoberfest
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
its
fairly
typical
solid
and
worth
a
shot
the
flying
fish
octoberfish
has
more
of
an
identity
to
it
but
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
what
an
octoberfest
should
be
a
very
smooth
aftertaste
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
and
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
of
beer
d
with
time
the
carbonation
decreases
but
the
beer
remains
crisptasting
and
moderately
bodied
with
a
sweet
maltiness
and
moderately
bitter
hop
finish
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
sure
id
buy
this
again
really
especially
since
its
not
really
an
oktoberfest
but
be
sure
if
it
was
a
red
and
did
taste
a
lot
like
one
that
wouldnt
be
a
factor
and
id
buy
it
for
the
taste
though
then
again
thatd
be
weird
if
a
red
was
matching
an
oktoberfest
but
i
digress
there
are
many
better
examples
of
both
a
red
and
an
oktoberfest
out
there
dont
get
me
wrong
this
could
be
pretty
solid
but
for
right
now
the
ingredients
seem
to
be
there
just
not
the
balance
which
certainly
needs
to
be
present
to
make
this
better
it
looks
nice
and
red
much
better
than
average
lacing
aroma
is
lacking
taste
is
slightly
malty
but
kind
of
bland
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
which
is
nice
i
question
as
to
why
this
is
called
an
octoberfest
but
styled
a
red
ale
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
medium
red
with
a
nice
sturdy
froth
sweet
bready
nose
nearly
artificial
in
its
flavor
implications
taste
is
somewhat
redemptive
keeping
everything
smooth
malts
assert
themselves
the
sweetness
not
so
pronounced
but
still
has
a
lactate
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
drinkable
but
not
very
noticeable
in
the
big
scheme
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
a
nice
easy
drinking
oktoberfest
here
without
any
defects
a
solid
drinking
beer
that
would
be
welcome
here
as
an
everyday
beer
pours
dark
redbrown
with
a
rather
short
head
quick
dissipation
good
carbonation
and
some
lacing
smell
is
ok
light
malts
with
light
hops
taste
is
fuller
consisting
of
lightmedium
bready
malts
some
bitter
hops
a
bit
of
fruitness
and
hints
of
spice
pretty
light
for
an
oktoberfest
but
a
good
drinker
nonetheless
actually
one
of
the
better
american
amberred
ales
ive
had
recently
it
stays
away
from
the
sickly
sweet
element
that
too
many
in
this

succumb
to

a

toasty
and

clean
not

pretty

pretty

a

i
would
have
no

putting
several
of
these
down

take
the

it

b
it

the
punch
of
an

or
thomas
hooker
oktoberfest
but
as
the
bros
point
out
it
is
extremely
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
but
definitely
a
beer
to
pair
with
brauts
sauerkraut
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
a
well
rounded
beer
nonetheless
smooth
from
the
start
with
gentle
malt
flavor
and
a
hint
floral
grains
on
the
finish
flavor
lasts
a
second
or
too
after
swallowing
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
good
starter
to
the
style
very
drinkable
mediocre
typical
for
saranac
not
great
but
not
bad
i
would
take
it
if
nothing
else
good
were
available
its
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
so
as
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
gains
points
for
that
malty
smooth
biscuity
with
a
cracker
finish
but
a
bit
thin
lacking
in
carbonation
and
underwhelming
a
great
representation
of
the
style
by
an
american
brewer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
this
is
a
fine
brew
indeed
overall
this
is
a
good
oktoberfest
offering
pretty
typical
for
the
style
it
did
not
blow
me
away
but
it
is
worth
trying
i
normally
am
not
all
too
impressed
with
saranacs
offerings
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
honey
more
so
than
caramel
was
the
dominant
sense
in
both
smell
and
taste
and
with
the
taste
it
was
a
warming
honey
biscuit
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
will
probably
get
this
again
next
year
o
my
own
minioktoberfest
consisted
of
a
blind
sidebysidebyside
tasting
of
oktoberfests
by
sam
adams
saranac
and
dundee
somewhat
surprisingly
saranac
came
in
last
im
not
very
well
versed
in
oktoberfests
but
saranac
seemed
to
be
a
below
average
oktoberfest
and
about
average
overall
onot
mouth
filling
flavorful
but
maybe
because
i
am
not
experienced
enough
in
octoberfest
beers
not
sure
but
compared
to
a
few
others
i
have
had
its
ok
if
you
are
standing
in
the
store
right
now
reading
this
like
i
have
in
the
past
check
the
next
brand
if
you
are
mixing
a
sixer
give
it
a
whirl
overall
im
disappointed
in
this
beer
not
much
going
on
at
all
its
just
there
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
if
offered
and
there

autumnal
cuisine
a
very
versatile
brew
one
of
saranacs
better
seasonals
o
excellent
beer
for
the
price
just
got
a
sixpak
at
7
50
this
is
absolutely
outstanding
o
about
an
average
oktoberfest
in
terms
if
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
i
have
tried
good
brew
here
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
thin
foamy
white
coating
of
head
aromas
of
tangy
caramel
roasted
nut
hints
of
pumpkin
and
some
very
light
spicing
the
nose
lends
itself
more
to
the
sweet
side
a
touch
unbalanced
flavors
are
a
touch
light
with
a
roasted
grain
and
light
toffee
blending
in
the
backbone
minimal
spicing
and
an
overall
watery
mouthfeel
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
roast
and
pumpkin
sweetness
but
it
also
falls
short
on
flavor
and
feel
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
o
nothing
bad
about
it
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
either
clear
amber
colored
with
a
beige
sizzly
head
that
settles
out
quickly
sweetish
aroma
of
doughey
malt
some
corn
and
cinnamon
flavors
fairly
match
the
nose
plus
a
metallic
note
some
dried
leaves
mild
bitterness
lingers
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
a
bit
slick
with
some
carbonation
sting
decent
beer
overall
clear
rusty
copper
color
little
to
no
head
scent
leads
with
caramel
malt
and
mineral
water
some
stale
earthy
hops
taste
is
light
and
filled
with
notes
of
sweet
caramel
and
residual
sugar
light
earthiness
little
hops
light
bodied
moderately
carbonated
a
little
too
much
sweet
and
not
enough
of
anything
else
to
be
that
good
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
tastes
rather
watered
down
especially
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
maltier
beers
in
the
style
we
all
have
our
favorite
octoberfest
this
isnt
one
of
them
i
tryed
something
diffrent
and
boy
it
bit
my
ass
the
beer
has
too
much
head
too
much
foam
doesnt
taste
like
auturm
stay
away
from
this
beer
if
you
have
taste
if
a
poor
man
oto
fest
enjoy
your
favorite
and
dont
try
this
one
enjoy
the
fall
beers
overall
i
really
like
this
one
its
just
so
so
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
refreshing
clean
feel
it
has
a
great
spicy
feel
to
it
but
its
subtle
a
straightforward
oktoberfest
malt
bill
is
raw
and
toasty
mild
hops
do
their
job
the
yeast
plays
a
part
as
well
easy
drinking
but
nothing
to
seek
out
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
sampled
from
this
brewery
the
feel
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
not
because
its
too
light
its
actually
about
mediumbodied
but
because
its
much
too
crisp
and
carbonated
being
biting
and
overly
fizzy
it
calms
down
eventually
but
the
smoothness
that
follows
is
just
enough
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
a
good
but
not
great
octoberfest
the
palate
leans
strongly
on
the
hops
particularly
the
earthy
and
dusty
tettnangs
lending
both
a
mild
bitterness
and
moderate
flavor
moderate
caramel
and
mild
brown
sugar
characteristics
are
present
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
burnt
toast
this
beer
feels
just
a
touch
watery
on
the
midpalate
carbonation
is
moderate
apart
from
my
quibble
about
the
watery
mouthfeel
i
have
no
major
complaints
about
this
beer
none
of
the
sulfur
of
the
nose
is
present
on
the
palate
in
addition
the
hops
add
an
almost
mineral
note
to
the
beer
solid
stuff
from
a
brewery
that
i
drank
a
lot
of
in
my
earlier
days
overall
this
octoberfest
wont
blow
your
mind
by
any
means
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
simplicity
from
time
to
time
decent
flavor
and
very
drinkable
o
great
would
buy
again
looks
nice
and
tastes
nice
my
first
brew
from
this
company
and
its
a
nice
first
impression
overall
honestly
im
not
sure
what
this
beer
may
have
tasted
like
or
if
this
is
the
beer
as
it
was
released
i
really
hope
not
because
it
might
as
well
be
sold
as
an
adjunct
with
how
little
flavor
it
has
it
needs
a
much
better
mouth
feel
not
to
mention
a
real
boost
in
malt
character
to
be
a
good
example
of
a
maerzen
o
something
about
the
taste
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
but
this
beer
looks
phenomenal
i
liked
the
otter
creek
better
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
half
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
slightly
hoppy
with
a
faint
aroma
of
citrus
taste
is
also
sweet
and
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
everyday
octobefests
notes
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
is
makes
up
for
in
sheer
drinkability
it
goes
just
as
good
with
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
than
any
other
oktoberfest
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
tart
hops
and
toffee
taste
is
quite
acrid
and
nutty
severish
finish
hops
are
strong
bit
of
cereal
body
totally
acceptable
also
a
chemical
taste
i
cant
quite
figure
out
overall
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
but
its
not
a
great
marzen
the
flavors
dont
mesh
and
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
mild
this
was
a
pleasant
oktoberfest
from
the
good
folks
at
matt
brewing
it
doesnt
quite
hold
up
to
others
ive
had
like
flying
dog
dogtoberfest
for
example
but
is
certainly
holds
true
to
the
style
the
appearance
is
amber
with
slight
hints
of
red
and
smell
is
in
sync
with
the
overall
presentation
of
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
nice
smell
that
goes
well
with
the
taste
the
surprise
is
the
finish
leaving
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
well
worth
the
trip
will
go
nice
with
some
old
bay
shrimp
from
the
12
beers
a
fallin
been
pleasantly
surprised
so
far
as
the
saranac
mixed
packs
dont
get
no
respect
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
geordie
schooner
nice
frothy
head
and
copper
amber
color
typical
malty
scent
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
nice
and
bready
paired
with
a
sauerkraut
dog
nice
complement
a
good
basic
festbier
o
a
really
good
one
for
a
session
or
with
a
nice
garlic
chicken
pizza
like
i
had
thumbs
up
poured
a
light
amber
orange
color
with
minimal
head
that
dissapeared
in
seconds
scent
is
slightly
floral
taste
is
unexeptionala
touch
too
hoppybitterlabel
says
they
use
saaz
and
tettnang
hops
with
tworow
and
crystal
malts
its
ok
but
there
are
much
better
octoberfest
marzens
out
there
this
oktoberfest
lager
had
a
familiar
appearance
coppercolor
with
fluffy
white
head
it
had
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
to
it
but
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
that
wasnt
bad
but
a
slight
mark
against
it
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
one
of
the
octoberfest
beers
i
like
to
keep
in
stock
this
one
came
out
of
the
12
beers
a
falling
saranac
variety
pack
moreys
bottom
line
i
recently
read
a
lew
bryson
review
for
this
beer
and
he
got
my
hopes
up
a
bit
its
good
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
great
lakes
version
or
even
the
sam
adams
for
that
matter
oi
will
be
having
it
again
soon
as
apart
of
an
oktoberfest
tasting
so
ill
see
how
it
stacks
up
against
some
others
but
it
seemed
bland
and
lacking
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
marzenoctoberfest
beers
this
one
is
just
ok
easy
to
drink
but
offers
very
little
excitement
in
the
taste
easy
to
drink
and
for
what
its
priced
at
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
a
bit
too
much
on
the
amber
reddish
american
malt
profile
but
gets
some
of
the
toasty
cereal
malts
right
light
hops
are
nice
but
not
really
right
for
the
style
sweetness
is
right
drinkable
d
less
heart
and
hefty
than
many
us
versions
not
that
is
misses
the
style
at
all
it
is
just
a
lighter
and
perhaps
slightly
hoppy
take
on
a
classic
plenty
enough
drinkable
though
my
pour
generated
two
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
very
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
biscuity
malt
quality
underlain
by
a
soft
grassy
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
more
grassy
than
malty
on
the
tongue
the
finish
continued
to
have
a
more
bitter
than
sweet
quality
which
was
not
necessarily
to
my
liking
i
think
that
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
available
d
not
too
shabby
but
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
some
ways
again
more
akin
to
german
versions
than
our
super
sweeties
i

of
the
glass

of

good

of

and
a

good
price
good
choice
for
a
marzen
many
oktoberfests
on
the
market
and
this
one
was
deceny
but
not
near
the
elite
from
fall
brew
tasting
notes
2010
the
aroma
is
hardly
noticeable
consisting
mostly
of
spruce
and
citrus
its
golden
amber
appearance
is
standard
for
a
lager
but
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
an
octoberfest
minimal
head
the
taste
is
interesting
light
sweetness
medium
bitterness
and
lightly
sour
it
has
a
crisp
palate
with
a
thin
texture
and
lively
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
abrupt
decent
beer
for
the
category
d
rather
drinkable
would
probably
go
nicely
with
any
gravy
meal
chicken
beef
pork
turkey
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
bad
its
a
decent
beer
overall
it
just
wasnt
anything
that
stood
out
in
the
style
for
me
d
a
nofrills
marzen
but
not
a
bad
offering
from
saranac
they
have
seemed
to
take
measures
not
to
screw
up
too
basic
of
a
brew
and
its
5
4
abv
puts
it
right
in
line
with
many
german
marzens
and
basic
domestic

beers

on
the

style

attributes
pleasant
to

drinkability
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
for
the
qpr
this
is

a

the
first
ingredient
in

is
cinnamon
just
like
when
you
put
cinnamon
in
a
homebrew
other
than
that
some
sweet
autumnmalts
taste
didnt
sit
well
with
me
way
too
bready
and
the
bitterness
is
not
the
kind
of
bittering
hops
we
all
know
and
love
this
bitterness
combines
with
the
carbonation
and
destroys
the
roof
of
my
mouth
the
taste
of
cinnamon
doesnt
carry
over
heavily
it
leaves
a
sticky
undesirable
stale
malt
flavor
on
the
palate
i
would
not
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
however
saranac
has
other
good
brews
so
dont
turn
down
the
company
immediately

to
be

taste
follows

less
dominant
and
the

however
there
is

character
that
manifests
itself
towards
the

but
closer
to
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
with

fizzy

not
a
bad
marzen
perhaps
a
little
too
much
carbonation

some

offputting

that
bad

a
bit
of
caramel

as
well
as

the
taste
is

some

not

that

could
session
with

easily
the

not
the
most
complex

out
there
light
sweetness
noted
but
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
reminds
me
of
veggies
ive
had
better
balanced

for
sure
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
spritzy
side
smooth
this
one
out
a
bit
more
its
not
bad
for
the
price
but
probably
the
least
enjoyable
of
the
style
ive
had
this
year
pairing
best
pairing
with
food
so
far
was
with
a
beef
stew
it
matched
the
heaviness
of
the
stew
and
mixture
of
the
vegetable
aftertaste
with
the
beer
elevated
the
overall
dinner
experience
the
pour
is
a
clear
copper
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
bready

little
grassy
the
flavor
is
pretty
standard

bready
and

hoppy

average
carbonation
a
standard
marzen
decent
session
type
brew
a
little
lighter
than
i
am
used
to
with
this
style
but
very
nice
over
all
not
terribly
complex
but
nicely
done
drink
there
is
nothing
special
here
an
average
beer
that
is
fine
to
drink
1
of
every
october
pretty
good
not
great
but
meets
the
standard
cant
beat
the
priceat
least
for
this
sample
pack
a
worthy
beer
from
a
sofar
worthy
brewery
the
smell
is
crisp
and
fresh
and
i
felt
like
drinking
a
nice
mouthful
right
away
it
has
a
nice
light
body
and
great
balance
you
will
taste
the
slight
bitterness
of
german
hops
after
you
let
the
beer
linger
in
your
mouth
which
adds
to
the
value
of
this
very
drinkable
seasonal
brew
just
like
it
is
meant
to
be
for
the
celebration
of
the
oktoberfest
where
the
masses
enjoy
a
few
good
liters
of
fine
beer
d
medium
drinkability
on
this
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
would
make
me
want
a
whole
lot
more
decent
body
and
pretty
smooth
feel
with
minimal
carbonation
a
good
easy
drinker
but
different
than
i
expected
still
not
bad
for
a
change
mouthfeel
syrupy
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
also
mild
malts
with
some
hints
of
hops
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
special
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
d
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again

octoberfest
is
much
better
d
quite
nice
a
good
octoberfest
worth
a
try
d
pretty
high
this
octoberfest
does
not
disappoint
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
who
would
have
guessed
that
f
x
matt
would
be
putting
out
such
high
quality
craft
beers
just
a
couple
of
decades
after
utica
club
was
the
swill
of
the
masses
as
usual
saranac
delivers
an
excellent
beer
at
a
low
price
5

here
in
maryland
over
300
miles
from
the
brewery
not
too
shabby
d
it
is
not
offensive
in
any
way
it
just
misses
in
almost
every
area
the
color
is
not
bad
sure
it
drinks
easy
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there

toasty

that
is

quite
simple
not
a
bad
beer
but
far
from
great
and
far
from
being
the
best
of
the
bargain
price
oktoberfests
its
an
average
oktoberfest
no
more
and
no

nothing
really
jumps
out
here
and
nothing

the
pour
is

amber
in
tone
with
good
clarity
and
about
a
halfinch
of
foamy
offwhite

caramel
malts
lead
the
aroma
with
a
little
light
yeast
in

background
the
caramel
malts
are
stron

with
a
likeable
mellow
hoppiness
it
reminded
me
of
an
octoberfest
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
saranac
but
this
beer
was
suprisingly
decent
not
the
best
marzen
by
any
means
but
very
drinkable
and
considering
the
price
this
beer
is
a
great
value
d
interesting
cross
between
a
classic
german
marzen
and
the
sweeter
caramel
flavored
marzen
typical
of
american
breweries
to
my
surprise
it
wasnt
terrible
just
ordinary
a
pale
clear
orange
beer
balanced
taste
and
nose
the
best
part
is
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink

with
1

head
that

and

taste
follows
directly
from
the

with
a

could
definitely
use
more

overall
a
pretty
decent
marzen
d
a
good
session
beer
but
not
amazing
by
any
standards
might
be
good
to
convert
your
friend
who
only
drink
miller

to
try
some
other
micros

a

wiht
some

along
with
a

on
the

a
rather
simple
beer
that
is
light
in
both
malts
and
hops
but
an
easy
drinker
and
not
bad
to
have
from

and

is
a
nice

of
hops

sweet

with
some
spices
with
sweetness
dominating
taste
is
also
pretty
sweet
with
some
spice
and
dark
fruits
especially
upon
warming
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
drinkability
is
relatively
high
kind
of
an
average
beer
worth
a
look
if
you
are
into
marzen
otherwise
dont
worry
about
it
incidentally
saranac
is
a
fine
brewer
that
can
and
does
produce
some
quality
beer
see
my
review
of
their
imperial
stout
unfortunately
their
oktoberfest
is
not
one
of
them
how
would
the
germans
say
meh
pours
a
copper
color
and
a
small
yet
respectable
white
head
as
the
beer
head
settles
a
little
lace
is
left
behind
the
beer
has
a
good
aroma
hops
with
a
bit
of
malt
in
it
and
a
few
spices
maybe
some
caramel
it
has
a
full
body
but
more
syrupy
that
i
expect
in
a
ocktoberfest
but
at
the
same
time
it
goes
down
easily
i
think
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
without
complaint
the
flavor
is
malt
an
hops
there
are
certainly
some
toasted
grains
in
there
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
there
is
a
slight
lingering
over
all
not
a
bad
rendering
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
normal
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
pretty
copper
color
and
a
small
but
respectable
white
head
made
of
small
bubbles
as
the
head
is
settling
a
little
bit
of
lace
is
left
behind
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
aroma
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
malt
in
it
and
a
few
spices
but
nothing
that
i
can
definitely
identify
the
thing
that
strikes
me
first
as
i
taste
the
beer
is
its
full
body
its
more
syrupy
that
i
expected
but
at
the
same
time
it
goes
down
easily
i
think
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
without
complaint
the
flavor
is
more
malt
than
hops
there
are
certainly
some
toasted
grains
in
there
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
there
is
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
that
is
enjoyable
the
beer
just
wasnt
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
very
light
on
the
palate
not
overly
sweet
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
soon
most
impressive
where
it
counts
love
the
toastyyeasty
notes
as
this
slightly
warms
up
on
this
rainy
windy
cool
40
degree
day
in
pa
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
marzen
appears
a
hazed
muted
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
light
tan
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
toasted
bread
and
cereal
grains
green
apples
pears
sweet
biscuits
caramel
malt
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
pretty
decent
and
accessible
as
well
d
a
very
good
oktoberfest
beer
to
drink
smooth
from
the
bottle
or
glass
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
american
oktoberfest
brews
i
have
had
disappointed
i
only
found
one
six
pack
but
happy
to
have
enjoyed
what
i
bought
and
looking
forward
to
more
whenever
possible
wow
pretty
nice
in
a
climate
where
a
lot
of
german
oktoberfests
have
been
dumbed
down
to
the
point
of
being
just
malty
golden
lagers
and
many
american
brewers
use
too
heavy
of
a
hand
with
the
malts
matt
has
kept
theirs
balanced
and
to
style
very
nicely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
tasted
this
year
cheers
overall
this
is
an
okay
octoberfest
i
am
being
kind
of
harsh
on
the
ratings
but
there
just
isnt
enough
here
to
warrant
a
purchase
nothing
even
a
beer
nood
hasnt
seen
before
a
pretty
main
stream
beer
not
the
worst
octoberfest
you
could
buy
but
definetly
not
the
best
i
remember
having
this
a
couple
of
years
ago
so
i
picked
up
another
six
pack
this
year
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
i
drank
about
3
of
the
6
pack
before
i
reviewed
it
just
in
case
i
happened
to
get
a
bad
beer
but
my
review
stays
pretty
consistent
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
has
a
fizzy
head
to
it
that
goes
away
very
quickly
little
lacing
at
first
then
it
goes
away
completely
smell
is
very
good
has
a
very
clean
smell
to
it
mostly
malts
the
taste
is
again
a
very
clean
taste
dominated
by
mostly
malts
a
little
bit
of
roasted
taste
as
well
it
doesnt
finish
all
that
well
almost
a
little
bland
but
id
still
say
its
an
above
average
taste
based
on
the
initial
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
too
carbonated
not
quite
the
characteristic
of
an
octoberfest
the
drinkability
is
very
good
one
of
the
more
refreshing
octoberfests
ive
had
this
is
overall
one
of
the
more
lighter
looking
and
tasting
octoberfests
ive
tried
but
not
bad
id
recommend
it
more
on
a
warmer
fall
day
than
a
cool
one
but
dont
avoid
it
just
cause
its
lighter
d
a
decent
brew
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
saranac
octoberfest
is
a
sparkling
crystal
clear
amber
lager
with
a
pillowy
foamy
offwhite
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
faint
wooden
herbal
scent
and
the
malt
smells
bready
and
pretzely
it
seems
a
little
funky
it
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
dry
with
a
very
dry
and
chalky
finish
it
has
a
light
wooden
botanical
bitterness
thats
well
balanced
with
the
sour
dough
pretzel
flavor
its
a
sufficient
oktoberfest
d
easy
i
can
see
where
it
might
be
perceived
as
a
little
watered
down
again
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
drinkability
very
drinkable
really
good
beer
just
a
little
watery
a
sweetishbitterish
smell
but
nice
taste
is
terrific
mellow
and
smooth
lots
of
flavor
sharp
mouthfeel
and
coats
the
mouth
and
makes
the
next
sip
easier
overall
nice
i
would
drink
this
all
day
and
i
will
at
maddhoppers
oktoberfest
drinkability
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
a
bit
of
sweetness
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
there
are
better
marzens
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
bad
very
toasty
smooth
and
complex
its
got
a
nice
carbonation
and
flavor
this
is
the
best
oktoberfest
beer
ive
had
since
otter
creek
oktoberfest
d
as
i
said
before
it
is
okay
but
there
are
many
other
oktoberfest
to
enjoy
during
this
season
part
of
an
saranac
autumn
sampler
there
were
better
beers
in
the
12
pack
this
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
aroma
was
lacking
just
some
vague
spice
cinnamon
and
clove
in
the
taste
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
warming
from
the
spice
not
quite
pleasant
two
and
done
for
me
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
cheap
in
my
area
but
there
are
many
better
representations
out
there
worth
a
try
i
still
prefer
the
sam
adams
version
d
definatly
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
chilly
october
evening
reminds
me
of
autumn
overall
a
very
solid
offering
but
again
nothing
really
spectacular
i
would
not
mind
having
it
again
but
what
would
be
the
point
pours
amber
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissapeared
quickly
smell
very
malty
and
bready
quite
nice
taste
yeasty
malty
bready
a
bit
sweet
rich
and
smooth
almost
creamy
good
sessional
beer
drinkable
would
definately
have
this
again
mouthfeel
is
perfect
grainy
malt
very
little
carbonation
check
it
out
ps
i
dig
the
bavarian
flag
label
scheme
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
produced
a
onefinger
sandywhite
head
atop
the
orangeamber
fluid
there
was
lots
of
rising
carbonation
decent
retention
of
the
head
and
good
lacing
in
thin
bands
the
aroma
was
soft
dry
grains
and
toasted
malt
the
flavors
were
good
but
the
aftertaste
odd
it
started
with
hop
bitterness
before
some
biscuity
malt
added
balance
it
then
became
very
dry
and
grainy
but
the
aftertaste
was
staleoff
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
carbonation
good
and
the
body
medium
it
was
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
enjoyable
enough

a
decent
oktoberfest
beer
that
goes
down
very
easily
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
dark
mahogany
color
i
had
a
big
rich
tan
looking
head
that
was
inviting
for
sure
the
brown
fuzz
oozed
a
malty
smell
that
was
a
hard
on
coming
for
the
taste
buds
the
taste
was
malty
and
sweet
but
not
too
much
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
will
buy
again
i
generally
think
that
matts
does
a
better
than
average
job
with
most
styles
this
is
no
exception
is
there
better
yes
but
for
the
price
and
for
the
consistancy
these
guys
do
it
very
well
this
poured
a
clear
amber
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
wild
yeast
with
copper
hops
and
some
earthy
caramel
malt
it
tasted
like
dry
earthy
barley
malt
and
copper
and
lime
hops
with
sour
yeast
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
didnt
have
the
best
flavor
and
it
wasnt
terribly
clean
either
the
body
was
ok
but
this
beer
just
wasnt
enjoyable
enough
to
make
we
want
to
finish
it
its
only
really
drinkable
as
a
2nd
or
3rd
beer
of
the
night
average
oktoberfest
but
very
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
bad
a
nice
balanced
malt
profile
perhaps
a
little
dry
but
interesting
enough
that
i
didnt
get
too
bored
its
a
little
too
overcarbonated
which
sort
of
shoves
the
malt
astringencies
down
your
face
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
clear
orangegold
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
with
little
lacing
toasted
malt
and
lemony
hop
aromas
grainy
biscuity
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
spicy
lemon
hops
that
last
into
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
dry
spicy
finish
easy
drinking
but
the
hop
bitterness
outweighs
the
malt
not
keeping
with
the
style
the
bottle
is
ugly
though
p
d
not
the
best
fest
beer
around
but
pretty
darn
drinkable
not
very
good
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
quite
unpleasant
it
does
look
nice
though
d
a
very
drinkable
marzen
from
saranac
which
isnt
a
bad
value
allow
it
to
warm
a
few
minutes
and
its
pretty
enjoyable
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
part
of
the
reason
is
that
there
just
isnt
much
about
this
beer
that
makes
you
sit
up
and
take
notice
bottle
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
disapating
white
head
aromas
of
straw
light
caramel
and
light
spice
palate
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
crisp
flavors
of
carmel
light
straw
and
spicy
hops
with
a
crisp
malty
finish
definitely
on
the
lower
end
of
the
oktoberfests
ive
ever
had
drinkability
i
wasnt
to
impressed
with
this
one
the
earthiness
of
the
taste
wasnt
done
well
and
i
especially
disliked
the
acidity
this
beer
had
in
my
mouth
not
an
awful
brew
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
there
are
much
better
octoberfest
beers
out
there
drinkability
is
moderate
its
fairly
easy
to
consume
but
boring
and
nowhere
near
the
best
oktoberfest
ive
had
not
really
doin
it
for
me
notes
overall
its
a
solid
yet
safe
oktoberfest
beer
drinkability
is
good
one
of
the
better
oktoberfests
ive
had
this
year
went
down
pretty
well
and
i
could
do
another
or
two
not
a
bad
seasonal
by
far
ill
probably
grab
a
6er
but
this
isnt
something
i
could
drink
all
year
a
rather
drinkable
beer
but
much
more
akin
in
flavor
to
an
apa
than
a
märzen
if
this
had
been
brewed
with
a
topfermenting
yeast
itd
make
a
decent
pale
ale
but
it
lacks
the
slight
caramel
sweetness
of
a
good
oktoberfest
pours
amber
with
a
nice
solid
dense
head
that
falls
to
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
strongly
malty
biscuity
and
dry
the
flavor
is
malty
a
bit
orange
citrusy
with
a
little
spice
burn
at
the
back
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
but
there
is
a
little
tingle
of
carbonation
that
brings
out
the
spiciness
a
nice
solid
little
octoberfest
better
than
the
average
octoberfest
as
ive
been
trying
a
lot
lately
and
its
definitely
not
one
of
the
best
but
better
than
a
lot
of
the
others
pours
a
boring
yellowishred
color
but
has
a
nice
malty
smell
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
are
carbonation
is
excellent
so
this
makes
the
drinkability
high
good
offering
from
saranac
d
in
a
word
highly
d
although
its
not
all
that
well
balanced
and
doesnt
provide
the
malt
im
looking
for
in
a
marzen
it
is
fairly
drinkable
due
to
its
unoffensive
nature
bottleartwork
standard
saranac
bottle
with
the
exception
of
the
blue
and
white
diamond
check
pattern
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
copperamber
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
spicy

finish
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
very
drinkable
i
have
had
better
oktoberfests
but
for
5
99six
this
one
hits
the
mark
d
not
among
the
better
oktoberfests
that
ive
tried
but
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
and
its
certainly
not
a
drain
pour
brownamber
color
medium
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
semisweet
aroma
with
a
blend
of
hops
and
malt
the
flavor
was
very
well
balanced
including
light
malt
spices
brown
sugar
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
i
recommend
this
one
its
a
good
drink
maybe
i
am
not
sure
about
the
rating
system
here
but
c
means
average
is
this
an
above
average
beer
not
bad
a
good
but
not
outstanding
ofest
flavor
is
mild
and
pleasant
worth
a
try
my
local
beer
distributor
still
has
several
cases
of
this
lying
around
and
when
it
went
on
sale
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
i
am
familiar
with
saranac
products
and
they
rarely
disappoint
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
and
drinks
smooth
taste
is
a
little
caramel
and
dash
of
hops
similar
to
a
watered
down
version
of
sam
adams
overall
a
very
good
octoberfest
but
could
have
a
little
more
flavor
great
price
19
00
case
my
friend
the
sage
recommended
this
as
we
sampled
some
saranac
wares
not
bad
and
better
than
others
ive
tried
from
saranac
to
be
sure
two
fingers
of
offwhite
cap
on
an
orangeruby
body
nicely
done
the
smell
is
a
bit
weak
unfortunately
with
some
spice
and
bready
yeast
kicking
around
but
not
nearly
enough
the
taste
isnt
bad
at
allsmooth
a
bit
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
caramel
sweetnessmaking
the
smell
all
the
more
disappointing
for
what
it
didnt
indicate
this
flattens
out
somewhat
early
dragging
down
the
drinkability
a
notch
yet
this
is
on
the
whole
fairly
good
oktoberfest
not
a
topoftheline
beer
but
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
seems
to
be
one
that
is
much
better
with
food
than
on
its
own
anything
with
salt
helps
to
cut
some
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
cheese
pretzels
or
a
full
meal
and
this
becomes
a
drinkable
beer
by
itself
id
prefer
one
of
saranacs
high
peaks
series
instead
d
overall
an
ok
beer
certainly
better
than
the
adirondack
lager
if
only
in
complexity
but
not
the
most
balanced
beer
while
the
thin
body
might
enable
you
to
drink
more
of
these
than
some
other
oktoberfest
beers
i
believe
that
the
lack
of
flavor
would
inhibit
me
from
wanting
to
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
average
drinkability
this
beer
does
not
represent
this
style
of
beer
well
i
know
it
is
late
in
the
season
to
be
reviewing
an
octoberfest
but
i
had
it
and
is
one
of
the
only
brews
from
saranac
i
have
not
reviewed
this
brew
poured
to
a
copper
color
with
a
very
small
light
tan
head
that
did
not
have
much
retention
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
te
aromas
seem
to
be
mostly
toasted
malts
with
some
caramel
highlights
the
flavors
are
fair
would
say
it
does
not
compare
to
sam
adams
version
just
comparing
it
to
it
since
it
is
the
most
readily
available
here
and
just
a
quickeasy
standby
caramel
and
roasted
flavors
come
out
but
also
has
a
little
odd
aftertaste
that
i
have
never
really
been
overly
keen
to
this
is
a
brew
i
always
have
just
because
it
seems
that
every
fall
people
have
it
in
their
fridges
many
better
octoberfests
available
but
for
the
price
point
it
is
not
to
bad
d
not
very
tasty
doesnt
go
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
poor
representation
of
style
there
would
have
to
be
a
very
limited
array
of
choice
available
for
me
to
select
this
beer
again
and
i
certainly
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
light
body
on
this
makes
for
easy
drinking
but
i
just
wish
there
was
more
that
excited
me
in
the
aroma
and
taste
department
theres
just
too
many
other
ofests
out
there
that
id
rather
spend
my
time
and
money
on
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
had
better
octoberfest
beers
but
wanted
to
try
it
a
very
mediocre
octoberfest
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
it
pours
a
nice
amber
with
some
head
and
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
caramel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
lager
with
a
flat
caramel
almost
what
i
call
a
cola
syrup
taste
that
is
just
not
that
enticing
there
is
a
sharp
bite
to
this
beer
that
makes
no
sense
and
im
not
certain
where
it
comes
from
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
okay
the
aftertaste
has
that
bite
again
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
you
can
do
better
in
seeking
out
other
beers
of
this
style
saranac
octoberfest
was
amber
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
small
but
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
caramel
malt
lightly
toasty
with
some
hops
the
taste
was
toasted
and
caramel
malt
with
some
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
little
bitter
it
was
just
less
than
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
decent
oktoberfest
but
not
the
best
that
ive
tried
okay
for
what
its
worth
but
there
are
lots
of
better
out
there
wouldnt
get
again
a
middle
of
the
road
oktoberfest
for
this
season
that
may
be
better
in
a
draft
version
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
touch
of
grainyness
easy
to
drinkjust
barely
enough
taste
to
be
sessionable
typical
saranacdecent
beerbut
not
too
excitingbut
very
drinkable
not
saranacs
best
beer
but
it
is
definitely
another
solid
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewery
drinkability
this
looks
to
be
the
last
new
oktoberfest
beer
ill
have
for
the
season
bummer
this
is
a
fine
modern
oktoberfest
that
is
very
easy
to
session
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
crisp
taste
makes
it
nice
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
light
spicy
hops
this
marzen
starts
of
sweet
with
the
caramel
malt
but
is
quickly
offset
by
spicy
and
somewhat
bittermetallic
hops
the
malt
has
some
toasted
qualities
to
it
the
feel
is
moderate
and
well
carbonated
and
finished
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
a
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
brew
probably
one
of
the
better
saranac
offering
that
i
have
had
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
that
holds
up
well
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
floral
aromas
with
a
slight
hop
and
spice
there
also
bready
malt
taste
with
a
citrus
lemon
turning
to
a
slightly
bitter
grapefruit
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
crisp
not
bad
but
not
my
first
choice
im
not
much
for
oktoberfests
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
while
if
im
in
the
upstate
area
again
ill
give
it
another
go
this
poured
a
pale
amber
with
some
head
i
found
this
to
be
more
pale
than
other
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
smell
is
abundantly
malty
with
some
hops
this
is
also
reflected
in
the
flavor
as
well
hops
and
malt
are
present
it
goes
down
quite
easily
relatively
smooth
overall
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
nice
session
beer
edit
91008
this
years
offering
seems
a
bit
thicker
than
last
years
and
not
as
dry
d
very
drinkable
could
put
a
couple
of
these
down
pretty
easily
one
of
the
better
octoberfests
in
my
opinion
notes
this
one
is
not
too
shaby
it
is
certainly
a
solid
year
round
beer
cheers
d
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
one
glass
so
i
just
pounded
it
pours
with
a
minor
white
head
that
goes
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
clear
light
amber
color
starts
malty
finishes
smooth
and
hoppymalty
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
good
carbonation
light
bodied
not
heavy
at
all
as
some
reviewers
have
mentioned
not
as
rich
as
the
brewer
claims
the
abv
is
5
3
still
saranac
is
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
the
macro
drinkers
it
had
a
heineken
kind
of
skunk
smell
and
taste
to
it
kind
of
strange
almost
clear
brown
in
color
the
moutfeel
was
kind
of
thick
and
the
flavor
very
middle
of
the
road
not
bad
just
exactly
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
saranac
very
hit
or
miss
some
beers
are
fairly
solid
and
others
are
better
suited
for
cooking
d
very
high
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
very
inviting
and
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
macroswilling
friends
d
ill
probably
say
it
in
every
saranac
review
but
they
all
seem
to
resemble
each
other
but
as
far
as
this
goes
it
was
enjoyable
wouldnt
seek
out
again
more
of
a
hitthespot
seasonal
decent
nose
with
caramel
and
familiar
sweet
two
row
malts
to
accompany
an
appropriately
marzen
color
head
and
lacing
head
and
overall
mouthfeel
both
possessed
an
otstanding
creaminess
i
havent
seen
in
other
saranac
beers
taste
has
a
brief
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
of
the
sip
along
with
the
sweet
nutty
malt
notes
nicely
dry
and
clean
in
the
finish
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
awesome
among
available
other
oktoberfest
beers
overall
a
very
drinkable
octoberfest
not
overly
sweet
very
sessionable
and
something
to
look
forward
to
as
the
days
get
shorter
md
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
more
complex
in
the
taste
than
in
the
aroma
a
decent
ofest
especially
for
an
american
one
thanks
jimi
for
another
brew
experience
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
saranac
i
found
this
one
much
more
enjoyable
than
previous
years
if
i
were
to
review
this
beer
based
on
the
first
couple
of
sips
it
would
be
much
lower
than
what
im
giving
them
currently
this
beer
actually
significantly
improved
as
it
warmed
initially
it
had
a
very
astringent
diacetyl
that
shrouded
all
other
flavors
that
actually
dissipated
as
i
drank
on
a
more
appropriate
malt
laden
sweetness
that
marzens
should
have
came
through
as
time
passed
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
as
well
as
it
seemed
a
little
grainy
and
foamy
i
dont
think
spoilage
plays
into
it
but
i
did
get
the
beer
in
south
carolina
which
is
a
ways
from
ny
state
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
there
are
much
better
options
for
the
octoberfest
fans
i
had
another
442007
and
it
held
up
nice
real
solid
marzen
imo
very
easy
drinking
a
smooth
refreshing
session
brew
good
to
have
another
fresh
lager
ofest
not
that
the
amber
ales
that
are
released
as
ofest
seasonals
are
all
that
bad
at
all
but
nice
to
have
a
smooth
fresh
beer
that
fits
the
style
well
this
is
a
nice
traditional
ofests
from
the
american
craft
industry
especially
where
body
and
drinkability
are
concerned
overall
while
not
my
favorite
it
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
i
got
a
sixer
for
5
99
and
at
that
price
its
a
bargain
the
same
store
sells
paulaner
and
spaten
oktoberfests
for
over
10
a
sixpack
this
one
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
and
even
if
youre
not
go
for
it
i
like
this
beer
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
especially
considering
the
price
but
its
not
what
i
have
in
mind
when
considering
the
oktoberfest
style
i
gotta
admit
this
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
rather
true
to
the
style
and
when
the
price
is
factored
in
it
becomes
even
more
attractive
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
typical
for
saranac
in
a
couple
ways
1
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
i
paid
9
99
for
a
12pack
2
its
a
solid
version
of
the
style
just
nothing
special
and
3
the
hops
seem
to
have
a
certain
saranac
flavor
to
them
even
where
theyre
saaz
and
tettnang
rather
than
what
they
use
in
their
pale
ale
and
ipa
i
bought
this
12pack
to
bring
to
a
party
and
it
served
its
purpose
well
even
so
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
this
season
this
one
is
ok
but
just
ok
i
think
it
has
been
better
in
recent
years
not
really
on
style
in
my
opinion
not
very
malty
with
little
bread
aroma
also
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
think
an
ofest
should
be
and
pretty
thin
with
that
said
worth
a
try
but
i
will
not
be
buying
anymore
this
season
drinkability
excellent
for
sessions
wellbalanced
and
not
too
highly
alcoholic
i
would
not
say
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
it
tastes
like
a
marginal
import
thats
popular
with
people
that
drink
whatever
beer
they
think
is
cool
that
said
it
has
a
light
body
with
an
almost
skunky
aroma
taste
is
starts
with
overly
sweet
caramel
followed
by
nice
hops
flavor
with
is
then
ruined
by
a
sour
skunk
flavor
it
wasnt
bad
at
first
but
the
aftertaste
is
rotten
what
a
shame
cheers
overall
a
decent
octoberfest
that
would
be
an
easy
session
beer
worth
a
try
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
but
not
malty
enough
for
me
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
seems
a
very
drinkable
lager
nothing
to
overwhelming
or
underwhelming
pours
deep
golden
with
orange
hue
one
finger
head
with
good
retentionand

is
malty
and
the
body
is

carbonated
taste
is
toasted
and
malty
up
front
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
as
for
most
of
the
saranac
products
good
but
not
great
still
worth
a
try
this
fall
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
orange
dense
one
and
a
half
finger
head
shows
excellent
retention
with
a
sticky
patchwork
of

and
tettanger
nose
some
mild
toasty
malts
in
the
background
sweet
munichvienna
toasted

meets
with
a
crushing
noble

dry

plenty
of
bitterness
and
monsterous
floral
saaz
and

flavor
medium

the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
has
a
dextrinous
rich
texture
nutty

toasted
at

but
near
the

the
german

overpower
what
should
be
a

despite
this
imbalance
it
remains
both
very
drinkable
with
lots
of
characterictic
german
malt
and
hop
flavor
d
its
a
solid
stab
at
the
style
sure
theres
a
nice
aroma
and
the
maltiness
is
nice
but
the
finish
isnt
that
great
and
detracts
from
the
beer
it
was
ohsoclose
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
off
the
mark
overall
impressions
while
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
quite
agreeable
it
is
also
rather
dull
for
an
octoberfest
which
is
a
boring
style
to
begin
with
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
go
bonkers
about
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
floral
hops
over
malt
the
taste
was
malt
with
a
little
caramel
and
a
floral
hop
finish
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
dry
a
nice
marzan
but
no
knockout
here
a
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
next
oktober
ill
probably
sample
a
six
of
someone
elses
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
brew
poured
out
to
an
appropriate
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
some
notes
of
lace
a
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
was
noted
aromas
of
malt
hops
and
almost
pickle
like
vinegar
was
detected
flavor
was
average
some
roasted
malt
and
bread
elements
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
average
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
would
be
best
with
some
pretzels
and
brats
worth
a
try
the
carbonation
is
slighty
fizzy
and
tickles
my
palate
overall
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
overly
complex
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
beer
to
have
quite
a
few
of
on
a
nice
fall
day
an
ok
oktoberfest
but
there
are
many
better
needs
a
bit
more
complexity
and
depth
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
could
drink
this
if
it
was
the
best
option
available
orangetan
with
tiny
head
that
fell
to
nothing
quickly
smell
is
a
pleasing
mild
toasty
malt
taste
is
similar
pleasing
and
mild
very
little
hoppiness
and
the
malt
is
subdued
mouthfeel
is
medium
thin
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
priced
cheaply
enough
to
make
it
a
reasonable
purchase
for
a
gathering
but
there
are
much
better
octoberfests
out
there
eh
id
drink
it
again
but
nothing
mindboggling
this
is
signature
saranac
was
another
malty
lagerish
safe
beer
necessary
not
bad
at
all
for
the
price
4
99
at
wegmans
smart
alternative
to
any
macro
this
time
of
year
but
a
bit
below
the
other
seasonals
ive
tasted
this
year
sam
adams
and
brooklyn
poured
a
shortlived
cream
colored
head
that
left
a
few
strings
of
lace
brilliant
copper
colored
beer
with
streams
of
fine
bubbles
rising
along
the
edges
sharp
barely
sweet
malt
aroma
that
has
a
strange
note
chicken
noodle
soup
faintly
sweet
caramal
malt
mixed
with
grassy
hops
a
pinch
of
bitterness
and
copper
in
the
finish
moderately
light
body
is
fairly
not
a
very
good
beer
strange
aromas
and
hops
that
taste
almost
vegetal
hide
what
would
be
a
crisp
refreshing
malty
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
and
ok
lace
weak
aroma
for
a
oktoberfest
some
slight
malt
and
hop
aromas
typical
stuff
its
flavor
is
more
of
a
weak
apa
and
not
a
oktoberfest
its
more
hoppy
than
malty
i
score
it
low
on
taste
not
based
on
that
its
a
bad
beer
it
just
does
not
reflect
the
style
well
its
too
hoppy
for
an
oktoberfest
good
drinkability
though
again
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
does
not
represent
the
style
in
my
opinion
overalla
subdued
but
decent
version
of
an
octoberfest
from
saranac
they
always
hit
the
style
well
and
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
is
right
at
home
with
other
octoberfest
entries
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
a
small
lace
but
stays
for
the
life
of
the
beer
has
a
roasted
malt
aroma
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
up
front
and
is
balance
out
with
a
spicy
hop
the
saaz
hops
stand
out
the
most
in
the
slighty
bitter
finish
this
is
an
all
around
no
frills
oktoberfest
lager
the
drinkability
is
almost
perfect
deep
orange
in
color
a
tad
darker
then
some
of
the
other
fest
beers
low
aroma
somewhat
sharp
and
metallic
smells
like
the
underside
of
the
bottle
cap
good
failry
clean
malty
flavor
nice
sweetness
in
the
finish
very
nice
mouthfeelholds
up
well
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
enjoyable
and
more
moderately
priced
then
a
lot
of
the
other
micro
fests
out
there
prosit
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
though
i
dont
think
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
first
octoberfest
of
the
season
and
its
not
even
september
yet
i
couldnt
wait
lets
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
pours
a
very
fallish
looking
deep
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
that
seems
to
be
fading
quickly
nice
clarity
smell
isnt
really
getting
me
overly
excited
sort
of
withdrawn
malt
scent
faint
nutty
smell
and
some
grainy
hints
hmmm
taste
isnt
really
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
an
octoberfest
a
little
bland
overall
a
subtle
maybe
too
subtle
nutty
characteristic
meshes
well
with
a
slight
toffee
taste
but
i
cant
tell
how
much
of
that
im
just
imagining
because
ive
been
craving
a
good
ofest
and
this
is
the
only
thing
i
could
get
my
hands
on
out
here
in
western
new
york
mainly
its
just
your
average
lager
only
a
little
sweeter
maybe
even
some
corn
tastes
in
there
and
sort
of
reminds
me
of
malt
liquor
or
something
not
the
best
i
cant
wait
next
week
when
ill
be
back
in
boston
hopefully
theres
some
better
selection
out
there
like
bbc
but
one
thing
is
for
sure
the
ofests
are
starting
to
come
out
and
thats
a
great
thing
mmmm
poured
a
crystal
clear
copper
copper
with
moderate
white
head
smell
is
mainly
of
toasted
malt
with
caramel
noted
taste
is
malty
with
caramel
and
bread
found
finished
sweet
and
malty
but
nothing
that
really
impresses
an
ok
beer
at
best
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
of
these
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
it
was
very
humdrum
light
brown
color
with
a
subtle
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
average
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
not
very
complex
at
all
pretty
wellbalanced
brew
thats
easy
on
the
palate
best
part
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
very
drinkable
a
decent
session
brew
but
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
just
a
very
average
beer
beer
looks
great
in
the
glass
a
rich
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
goes
away
in
a
couple
minutes
the
one
thing
that
stands
out
to
me
is
how
balanced
it
seems
it
has
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
but
light
enough
that
it
doesnt
feel
at
all
heavy
perfect
for
a
fall
day
enjoying
that
last
warm
day
before
the
winter
winds
blow
in
pours
orange
with
fizzy
white
head
has
the
smell
of
faint
toated
malt
taste
has
some
toasty
malt
sweetness
with
a
tangy
aftertaste
and
faint
hop
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
well
balanced
lager
with
some
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
choice
for
having
a
few
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
mellow
but
tasty
overall
a
decent
oktoberfest
surprisingly
bitter
but
great
hops
flavor
from
the
noble
varieties
they
used
as
an
octoberfest
this
defies
the
style
this
is
closer
to
a
lagered
bitter
i
like
this
more
than
a
typical
octoberfest
but
it
pushes
the
hop
envelope
to
me
this
seemed
like
a
hoppier
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfest
beer
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
picture
myself
drinking
one
of
these
again
average
all
around
the
beer
poured
a
goodlooking
clear
copper
with
a
nice
offwhite
creamlike
head
that
maintained
nicely
spiderlike
lace
is
always
nice
for
an
october
brew
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
also
caramel
roasted
malt
balanced
by
a
spice
hinted
hop
the
result
for
this
well
balanced
mild
carbonated
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
a
smooth
mild
drinkable
beer
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
is
felt
in
the
finish
not
a
complex
beer
that
nothing
overly
stands
out
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
alone
or
with
the
fest
of
october
pours
a
nice
copper
with
decent
almost
creamylike
head
that
settles
nicely
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lacebig
caramel
aromas
with
some
roasted
malt
in
the
background
with
a
light
pepper
note
as
well
taste
is
roasted
for
sure
with
some
lighter
caramel
notes
and
at
times
i
pick
up
a
light
grassy
hop
note
hey
better
than
what
i
was
expectingpicked
it
up
because
its
pretty
cheap
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
bt
did
get
a
little
cloying
after
a
awhile
in
addition
i
sampled
this
at
the
rochester
beer
fest
and
at
a
local
tasting
still
the
same
complaint
tastes
like
the
amber
it
pours
a
light
golden
brown
color
it
is
a
little
light
in
color
for
my
expectations
the
aroma
is
one
dimensional
malty
grain
the
oily
body
has
an
initial
bitterness
it
becomes
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
it
is
not
very
complex
but
has
enough
toasted
character
to
get
by
as
a
drinkable
oktoberfest
drinkabilitynotes
this
was
my
first
review
of
a
matt
brewing
co
beer
and
im
seriously
impressed
goes
down
so
very
nicely
awesome
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
dry
and
mildly
malty
the
taste
is
good
its
light
and
refreshing
but
with
a
bit
of
crystal
malts
to
give
it
some
character
it
is
slightly
bitter
and
balanced
with
a
light
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
drinking
fest
beer
another
fine
offering
from
saranac
saranac
made
a
bad
attempt
at
this
one
back
to
the
drawing
board
pours
with
a
big
puffy
creamcolored
head
the
head
is
very
stable
and
sits
atop
a
brownishamber
beer
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
and
has
hints
of
malt
not
nearly
the
sweet
malty
aroma
that
i
expected
seriously
intense
carbonation
drier
than
expected
finish
with
a
hoppy
almost
floral
quality
its
not
a
bad
beer
worthy
of
a
session
or
two
but
its
not
what
i
would
call
a
marzen
overall
a
decent
drinkable
ofest
nothing
too
special
but
not
bad
saranac
makes
some
ok
beers
but
i
think
theyre
geared
more
for
folks
getting
into
craft
beer
and
still
havent
developed
a
very
sensitive
palate
or
someone
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
flavorful
that
honey
brown
or
what
have
you
alright
but
i
wont
get
it
again
not
a
bad
little
beer
from
saranac
its
certainly
not
a
worldbeater
like
some
of
the
other
oktoberfests
but
has
a
nice
little
drinkability
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
if
i
didnt
have
only
a
single
overall
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
price
i
find
the
whole
saranac
line
almost
to
a
beer
to
fit
this
same
mold
whatever
style
it
happens
to
be
they
are
basically
lighter
i
e
watered
down
versions
of
said
style
the
ofest
is
no
exception
to
that
rule
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
descent
little
lager
it
has
some
ofest
qualities
but
they
are
in
short
supply
a
simple
easy
very
drinkable
beer
appears
copper
mild
brown
ale
with
a
cream
colored
decent
sized
head
and
leaves
scattered
patterns
of
lacing
aroma
consists
of
primarily
faint
caramel
and
other
specialty
malts
with
slight
nut
characteristics
not
bad
just
really
mild
and
clean
taste
great
drinkable
representation
of
an
ofest
just
not
the
best
version
has
the
components
the
mild
toasted
nuts
the
sweetness
swarming
the
palate
in
an
endless
battle
for
balance
of
the
flavors
and
mild
spice
here
great
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
for
the
typical
saranac
beer
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
their
better
done
seasonals
thank
god
nobody
wants
to
see
that
disgraced
overall
drinkability
is
decent
one
reason
it
does
an
alright
job
of
copying
such
a
great
style
of
the
oktoberfest
great
drinkable
version
just
toned
down
in
flavor
but
its
there
just
toned
down
i
like
for
me
saranac
brews
have
always
been
decent
or
below
average
they
never
seem
to
make
anything
truly
horrible
or
outstanding
fortunately
their
octoberfest
falls
in
the
decent
catergory
its
not
the
worst
fest
brew
ive
had
but
there
are
loads
that
are
better
it
pours
a
nice
rubyamber
colour
with
an
impressive
off
white
head
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
apparent
as
well
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
there
is
a
nice
hoppiness
here
as
well
and
its
medium
body
makes
it
quite
drinkable
overall
again
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
the
greatest
octoberfest
either
thin
light
and
lacking
flavor
man
has
saranac
really
let
me
down
lately
there
is
a
major
lack
of
body
in
this
beer
i
will
keep
my
hackerpschorrs
away
from
this
beer
because
they
would
only
insult
it
more
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
not
horrible
just
very
inferior
in
comparison
to
what
an
octoberfest
should
be
its
not
horrible
by
any
means
i
just
dont
think
its
all
that
special
either
as
might
be
indicated
by
being
a
limited
seasonal
beer
f
i
have
a
bit
of
a
prejudice
against
american
octoberfest
interpretations
but
i
cant
resist
something
new
saranac
has
made
a
decent
go
with
the
style
the
distinct
bread
malt
aroma
and
flavor
is
aptly
captured
the
body
is
nice
and
light
but
not
too
much
so
the
only
criticism
i
would
present
is
the
ibu
level
a
bit
more
sharply
bitter
than
i
would
prefer
but
on
the
whole
not
a
bad
brew
im
going
to
grab
some
more
of
this
and
put
it
away
before
it
vanishes
from
the
shelves
its
everything
i
wished
for
in
an
oktoberfest
hate
to
say
it
but
8
of
8
last
place
of
octoberfests
tried
so
far
this
year
this
was
my
second
octoberfest
this
year
and
after
sammys
try
i
think
anything
would
rate
high
this
was
a
nice
beer
with
the
marzen
red
color
the
head
was
a
little
thin
and
i
had
no
lacing
it
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
was
especially
dictinctive
not
that
it
was
bad
just
not
distinctive
i
noticed
more
hops
than
malt
but
the
overall
effect
was
good
very
drinkable
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
ofests
ive
had
more
traditional
than
others
nice
toasty
malt
characteristics
spicy
hops
lingering
lagered
finish
made
even
more
palatable
by
its
2
99six
price
tag
paid
up
in
utica
i
just
wish
i
had
it
on
tap
at
their
oktoberfest
which
i
missed
by
just
a
couple
of
hours
322
clear
copper
lager
with
full
head
that
vanishes
decent
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
and
trademark
saranac
malts
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
special
does
not
stand
up
to
other
fests
or
the
best
of
saranacs
other
beers
some
light
spiciness
in
the
malts
but
generally
corn
tasting
to
me
hops
are
not
quite
there
mouthfeel
is
thick
which
i
like
but
borders
on
syrupy
other
than
a
chunk
of
malt
flavor
at
the
beginning
of
the
sip
this
beer
is
hardly
there
theres
no
middle
bottom
or
finish
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
it
goes
down
easily
enough
just
nothing
exciting
either
maybe
with
a
full
plate
of
brats
and
some
oompah
music
in
the
background
this
beer
can
take
on
a
life
of
its
own
but
sitting
here
alone
at
my
computer
terminal
its
negligible
nice
bright
copper
body
topped
by
a
thinnish
white
head
but
nice
lacing
all
down
the
glass
good
carmelly
malt
aroma
better
than
expected
fullness
in
mouthfeel
some
toasted
malt
some
hop
bite
in
taste
but
a
little
bland
exceeded
my
expectations
slight
chill
haze
sort
of
a
brown
amber
color
thats
not
as
bright
as
some
one
half
inch
head
at
first
spidery
at
the
margins
in
50
seconds
nice
spicy
and
hoppy
aroma
sweet
and
hearty
caramel
malts
slightly
nutty
hop
balance
is
good
and
strays
into
the
lemon
range
rather
than
orange
rind
unusual
for
an
oktoberfest
nice
beer
here
like
black
forest
a
stronger
saranac
offering
theres
a
lot
of
variability
in
matt
beers
heres
hoping
they
focus
on
the
five
or
so
strongest
along
with
seasonals
pours
a
pleasant
light
orangish
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
is
too
fizzy
and
doesnt
last
very
nice
toasty
malt
in
the
nose
with
very
faint
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
nice
toasty
malt
with
a
short
burst
of
hoppy
spiciness
that
quickly
subsides
into
a
nice
balanced
finish
the
maltiness
is
a
touch
too
sweet
and
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
sticky
afterwards
otherwise
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
brew
but
with
the
other
ofest
options
available
i
will
not
be
revisiting
it
presumably
the
2002
version
this
brew
had
some
promise
beginning
with
the
color
and
aroma
deep
gold
nearly
amber
nice
looking
head
tan
and
creamy
aroma
is
equally
enticing
with
toasty
malt
and
nutty
notes
unfortunately
imho
it
falls
flat
after
that
inital
taste
is
metallic
and
astringent
too
cold
the
warming
action
dissipates
the
metallic
flavor
and
mellows
the
beer
blending
the
toasted
malt
caramel
and
nuttiness
in
a
rather
bland
way
ofests
arent
my
favorite
and
this
one
does
nothing
to
change
my
mind
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
to
me
it
does
not
taste
like
a
true
oktoberfest
this
is
the
first
american
brewed
interpretation
of
the
style
that
i
have
tasted
hop
flavor
is
present
but
the
brew
feels
a
little
thin
and
not
bitter
enough
for
a
true
oktober
i
would
drop
the
numbers
comparing
this
to
other
styles
but
i
just
cant
because
it
really
is
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
smoothness
are
excellent
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
many
of
these
on
a
brisk
fall
night
at
the
saranac
fall
festival
in
september
shes
a
hoppy
one
not
a
death
by
hops
