disappointing
considering
its
reputation
and
overall
score
from
the
community
at
large
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
taste
excellent
belgian
style
ale
with
an
abbey
feel
to
it
slightly
fruit
taste
but
with
a
good
dry
finish
hint
of
spices
make
it
more
bold
excellent
beer
to
drink
at
length
slightly
crisp
and
more
body
than
expected
ends
dry
feel
dry

true
abbey
ale
quality
flavor
brewed
right
here
in
cali
usa
outstanding
flavor
finish
look
and
feel
beautiful
cloudy
hue
and
very
potent
nice
light
lemon
and
yeast
taste
o
much
more
coriander
that
i
expected
or
wanted
i
love
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
my
days
in
humboldt
county
dry
and
spicy
and
not
to
my
taste
o
good
beer
a
classic
for
what
it
is
and
probably
the
best
or
darn
near
the
best
belgian
style
beer
made
in
the
united
states
one
of
the
originals
thats
for
sure
and
i
think
it
has
all
the
elements
its
authentically
belgian
in
appearance
no
doubt
with
a
foamy
tall
white
head
on
it
that
doesnt
fade
a
bit
the
nose
is
a
little
sweet
a
little
bubblegum
to
it
but
more
refined
fruit
notes
pear
and
yellow
plum
even
apple
to
it
lots
of
esters
there
and
it
translates
to
the
taste
where
yeast
is
really
the
primary
flavor
agent
although
the
beer
is
well
hoppy
for
what
it
is
and
has
a
rather
sturdy
grain
base
that
provides
structure
and
sweetness
almost
like
a
tripel
more
than
a
belgian
pale
in
the
grain
build
it
all
comes
together
really
well
though
a
great
unity
and
this
could
easily
pass
as
belgian
truly
one
of
those
beers
that
drinks
so
easy
though
you
dont
realize
how
strong
it
is
a
specimen
in
that
regard
look
out
possibly
my
favorite
all
the
time
beer
from
north
coast
pours
golden
with
a
solid
white
head
settles
down
to
a
half
finger
and
stays
light
to
moderate
carbonation
the
alcohol
content
does
take
some
getting
used
too
wine
was
giving
me
headaches
so
i
wanted
to
like
beer
but
it
was
not
happening
until
a
friend
introduced
me
to
pranqster
wow
this
beer
is
awesome
then
i
had
a
friend
who
barely
drinks
try
it
and
she
ordered
her
own
which
is
very
unusual
for
her
great
job
a
strong
fruit
and
wheat
start
but
the
favors
only
get
more
complex
as
you
drink
more
dont
settle
on
a
taste
get
a
pint
pranqster
has
a
smooth
subtly
fruity
taste
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
it
looks
and
feels
like
a
nice
belgian
ale
should
and
it
isnt
really
lacking
any
one
thing
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
face
with
how
good
it
isits
a
beer
id
drink
more
than
once
but
not
one
id
gush
over
to
friends
beautiful
artwork
and
smell
wow
easy
to
find
so
thats
an
extra
plus
this
was
a
great
tasting
belgian
strong
ale
it
had
everything
you
want
in
a
belgian
plus
amazing
rich
flavor
and
a
super
smooth
finish
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
belgian
strong
pales
a
delicious
ale
at
a
very
reasonable
price
point
fantastic
belgium
beer
easy
to
drink
and
heavenly
to
the
taste
i
tried
sierra
nev
heff
after
seeing
all
the
great
reviews
hated
it
same
with
this
i
was
blown
away
with
their
scrimshaw
pils
and
decided
to
try
the
brewerys
highest
rated
it
tastes
exactly
like
the
s
n
heff
is
this
the
taste
everyone
looks
for
dont
get
it
poured
a
clear
deep
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
mild
floral
notes
and
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
the
body
has
a
light
feel
and
weight
and
has
a
good
clean
finish

this
ones
worth
a

not

it
after

pranqster
pours
a
cloudy

with
a
small
but

there
is
a
sweeter
yeasty
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweetness
good
yeasty
and
mellow
belgian
candy
flavor
nice
body
and
good
flavors
overall
its
a
very
well
built
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgianstyle
ales
along
with
delirium
tremens
ommegang
etc
if
not
the
favorite
fantastic
o
tidy
not
as
sweet
as
other
belgian
golden
ales
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
not
the
most
outstanding
belgian
ale
ive
had
but
it
would
be
the
most
sessionable
big
flavor
a
little
unsophisticated
but
very
tasty
a
great
beer
for
someone
looking
for
something
big
but
not
bitter
you
cant
find
a
better
value
for
a
corked
brew
it
has
a
citrus
smell
and
after
taste
this
is
how
i
start
my
weekend
and
how
i
spend
my
money
while
on
budget
this
is
defiantly
the
lead
off
hitter
let
this
be
a
lesson
for
you
beer
brewers
adding
relevant
information
to
your
bottle
is
significant
to
many
of
your
buyers
i
expected
more
from
this
awesome
brewery
but
not
withstanding
it
is
ok
pours
a
very
thin
head
that
is
gone
before
you
can
count
to
10
great
color
and
smell
throughout
to
me
it
seems
like
a
light
belgian
if
that
is
even
a
category
rating
is
a
3
5
because
of
the
brewery
alone
actual
rating
is
a
3
0
they
know
what
they
are
doing
over
there
at
north
coast
but
this
could
be
a
lot
better
a
mild
belgian
that
i
would
like
to
try
on
tap
to
give
a
more
accurate
rating
overall
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
honestly
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
definitely
solid
but
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
i
expected
a
masterpiece
compared
to
a
duvel
or
delirium
tremens
this
beer
does
not
hold
up
it
lakes
the
buttery
texture
and
complex
flavor
profiles
of
the
belgian
originals
that
said
this
is
a
very
good
attempt
at
a
difficult
style
aromatic
but
not
pungent
fairly
high
in
abv
but
lower
than
most
belgian
examples
main
complaint
would
be
the
hop
character
is
too
pronounced
for
this
style
given
that
this
is
made
in
ca
i
am
not
surprised
by
that
i
would
still
say
that
old
rasputin
is
the
standard
bearer
for
this
brewery
overall
i
gave
it
4
0
beer
is
very
smooth
and
quite
nice
but
not
very
complex
seems
like
a
conservative
copy
of
a
belgian
i
would
buy
again
but
wish
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
unique
pours
nice
golden
yellow
in
color
with
about
a
good
half
a
finger
of
a
white
foamy
head
that
settles
to
just
a
thick
layering
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
but
that
is
about
it
the
aroma
is
just
malts
for
the
most
part
with
a
hint
of
some
sweetness
like
honey
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
the
malt
up
from
followed
by
some
spice
maybe
coriander
finishes
with
a
slight
sweet
that
is
a
tad
dry
also
overall
not
really
my
style
of
brew
pobably
the
best
american
version
of
a
triple
i
have
had
to
this
point
has
great
bubble
gum
and
banana
notes
along
with
the
crispness
you
would
from
a
triple
what
makes
this
better
than
the
average
american
interpretation
is
the
complexity
of
flavor
most
american
triples
are
a
simple
dry
version
of
what
the
belgians
do
this
triple
while
possessing
the
simple
character
of
the
triple
has
the
soft
complexities
that
you
get
from
the
best
belgians
in
this
category
my
only
disappointment
with
this
beer
is
that
the
head
dissipates
far
faster
than
a
delerium
or
duvel
it
is
gone
in
seconds
and
i
expect
a
beer
of
this
type
to
create
a
head
that
lasts
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
light
hazy
straw
color
some
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
belgian
yeast
nose
and
flavor
is
yeasty
orangelemon
with
light
sour
finish

for
a
12oz
bottle
berts
better
beers
hooksett
nh
sweet
tasting
overall
more
fruity
than
sugary
mild
clove
and
some
other
spice
at
the
finish
this
has
a
nice
feel
good
stuff
o
the
curveball
here
is
all
the
wheat
character
its
not
expected
as
when
youre
drinking
a
belgian
golden
you
tend
to
look
to
duvel
for
comparison
it
really
works
though
while
duvel
is
all
about
clean
pilsner
malt
character
and
great
balance
pranqster
achieves
a
similar
balance
albeit
with
a
wheaty
approach
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
complexity
because
of
it
yeast
malt
and
wheat
adjunct
and
hops
all
work
very
harmoniously
together
and
this
ends
up
being
far
too
easy
to
finish
overall
very
tasty
being
my
third
or
fourth
belgian
im
starting
to
find
that
i
really
enjoy
this
style
the
more
i
drink
it
hides
the
7
6
abv
very
well
o
outstanding
belgian
pale
ale
o
a
tasty
belgian
golden
kind
of
a
cross
between
an
american
blonde
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
o
im
not
into
belgians
o
i
get
this
damn
beer
mixed
up
with
their
old
stock
all
the
time
very
nice
homage
to
duvel
one
of
the
more
wellrendered
copies
marks
may
be
a
bit
low
here
o
great
beer
will
buy
again
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
heard
good
things
about
it
it
pours
dirty
and
cloudy
golden
real
stormy
appearance
with
strong
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
malt
it
has
a
strong
taste
of
malt
and
wheat
with
strong
traces
of
lemon
and
peper
it
had
average
carbonation
with
nice
head
and
no
lacings
goes
down
smooth
but
has
a
light
edge
and
is
pretty
light
on
the
stomach
it
pours
a
hazy
robust
golden
ale
color
with
little
to
no
head
very
purdy
smells
tasty
is
tasty
very
light
and
crisp
carbonated
it
goes
down
easy
peazy
like
a
pilsner
or
something
but
packs
a
punch
at
7
6
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
in
spring
or
summer
but
it
has
a
richness
that
makes
it
good
anytime
its
highly
drinkable
but
not
really
sessionable
per
se
it
is
sweet
and
fruity
and
bubblegummy
and
clovey
maybe
read
other
reviews
if
you
want
that
detailed
stuff
this
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
trippels
or
the
belgian
style
as
it
is
so
approachable
but
funky
and
complex
all
i
know
is
at
least
in
the
last
6
months
or
so
i
find
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
time
and
again
overall
a
pretty
interesting
belgian
style
ale
a
bit
more
on
the
grainy
side
with
a
somewhat
drier
taste
but
all
the
while
pretty
easy
drinking
while
nothing
super
extraordinary
it
was
rather
tasty
and
is
at
least
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
it
the
real
question
is
who
is
the
simon
cowell
looking
dude
with
the
smug
look
staring
at
you
on
the
label
pranqsters
probably
the
most
fruity
belgian
golden
ive
tried
flavor
and
aroma
match
very
nicely
just
enough
malt
to
add
structure
delicious
brew
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
like
it
o
refreshing
tame
and
highly
drinkable
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
belgian
style
californian
beer
i
would
swear
this
recipe
could
have
been
perfected
for
100
years
in
an
old
world
brewery
it
has
great
balance
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
and
excellent
finish
brew
poured
a
murky
orange
with
minimal
head
fairly
opaque
nose
is
bubblegum
clove
banana
and
fairly
sweet
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
fizzy
the
taste
is
a
watered
down
version
of
the
nose
nice
favors
but
a
far
cry
from
the
belgian
classic
and
even
some
of
the
non
belgian
rakes
on
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
you
would
probably
look
elsewhere
but
this
one
carries
some
heffe
like
characteristics
with
wheat
and
orange
not
really
my
thing
overall
like
goose
iland
matilda
this
is
an
exceptional
american
belgian
style
beer
delicous
will
absolutely
buy
again
and
heavily
recommended
ooverall
one
of
my
favorite
american
belgium
strong
ales
a
must
try
i
tried
this
beer
as
i
tend
to
like
most
of
the
belgian
ales
this
one
has
a
nice
golden
hazy
appearance
and
traditional
ale
smell
however
i
expected
the
taste
to
be
similar
to
leffe
or
beers
of
that
style
instead
it
is
closer
to
an
alelager
mix
that
almost
has
a
stale
flavor
that
is
complex
hard
to
describe
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
masked
well
this
beer
grew
on
me
but
not
something
likely
to
be
on
my
list
of
buy
again
beers
somewhat
surprised
at
the
exceptional
ratings
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
will
come
back
to
on
many
occasions
love
this
beer
almost
like
a
citrus
cider
wish
it
came
in
6
or
12
packs
good
beer
that
well
be
trying
again
o
not
spectacular
but
very
good
id
recommend
trying
it
just
as
id
recommend
trying
anything
from
north
coast
theyre
an
excellent
brewery
i
know
what
i
like
and
thus
is
one
i
like
tasted
great
with
the
hot
wings
we
had
before
the
super
bowl
thus
is
one
i
buy
when
i
can
find
it
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
i
am
not
into
all
the
categories
but
just
know
when
i
like
a
beer
this
just
tastes
good
o
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
in
this
big
fruity
beer
flavors
all
over
the
map
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
immediately
considered
going
out
to
buy
a
six
pack
after
i
was
finished
its
an
outstanding
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
it
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
and
was
hoping
itd
be
a
bit
more
spicy
that
comes
from
a
lot
of
good
belgian
beers
but
honestly
this
is
really
good
overallcomments
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
it
has
all
the
traditional
characteristics
of
the
style
that
one
would
expect
a
must
try
classified
as
a
belgian
strong
ale

o
a
solid
murican
interpretation
of
the
style
this
one
wasnt
fully
nailed
in
particular
it
needs
more
complexity
and
a
drier
back
end
but
its
reasonably
priced
enough
where
id
gladly
buy
it
again
o
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
four
words
almost
but
not
quite
the
most
impressive
thing
about
this
beer
for
me
was
that
it
camouflaged
its

so
effectively
there
are
much
better
authentically
belgian
andor

this

a
pretty

and
belgian
strong
ale
yeast
give
it
a
fruity
but
dry
aroma
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweetbut
quickly
follows
up
with
a
nice
dry
fade
mouth
is
fairly
dry
this
is
very
easy
going
and
pretty
straightforward
a
bit
untraditional
for
belgian
style
not
as
sweet
and
lighter
bodied
then
most
refreshing
like
a
kristal
weizen
with
more
kick
and
less
bubbles
a
nice
finisher
for
a
summer
evenings
lighter
beer
fare
or
a
nice
starter
for
a
darker
winter
excursion
o
a
nice
cheap
american
version
on
a
belgian
beer
didnt
expect
it
to
be
as
hazy
or
to
remind
me
so
much
of
a
hefeweizen
but
still
an
great
beer
none
the
less
o
golden
ales
are
not
my
favorite
belgian
style
but
the
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
is
pleasing
and
this
golden
measures
up
nicely
to
the
actual
belgians
a
very
satisfying
representative
of
the
style
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
yeast
fruits
taste
is
clean
mild
cloves
some
fruitiness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
a
pleasing
belgian
golden
ale
as
good
or
nearly
as
good
as
many
imports
which
cost
twice
as
much
o
north
coast
doesnt
make
bad
beer
this
is
just
another
excellent
brew
from
a
great
brewery
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
solid
beer
this
will
become
a
staple
because
its
such
a
good
value
wonderful
beer
that
i
would
stock
up
on
clean
not
filling
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
the
pranqster
poured
a
honey
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
and
that
signature
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
citrus
tang
with
the
belgian
yeast
clove
and
banana
the
pranqster
was
a
delicious
beer
that
satisfied
all
my
belgian
beer
tastes
i
highly
recommend
it
for
anyone
with
a
love
for
belgian
style
beers
a
little
spicy
but
just
right
it
seems
to
make
you
like
this
and
want
more
the
taste
evolves
i
get
a
likable
belgian
toasted
malt
character
at
first
with
a
citrus
note
and
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
but
the
bitterness
devolves
into
a
more
pepper
like
finish
that
lingers
right
on
target
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
very
good
mix
of
yeast
spice
and
fruit
esters
stands
up
there
with
some
of
the
authentic
belgian
styles
overall
eh
just
okay
i
was
really
overpowered
by
the
yeastiness
of
this
one
first
time
trying
this
or
anything
from
north
coast
for
that
matter
i
dont
usually
go
for
the
four
packs
but
it
was
on
sale
whoo
pours
golden
totally
clarified
effervescing
like
crazy
with
about
an
inch
of
cream
head
smells
of
crisp
apple
yeast
a
little
funkiness
somewhat
underwhelming
flavor
profile
given
the
nose
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
more
cidery
than
i
expected
lightly
sweet
yeasty
and
tad
bitter
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lower
side
of
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
really
apparent
i
gotta
say
theres
almost
something
pilsnerlike
about
it
and
i
like
a
good
pils
but
was
expecting
something
more
like
a
tripel
definitely
get
a
warming
sensation
in
the
belly
from
the
7
6
abv
overall
i
think
its
good
but
im
not
wowed
by
it
i
will
say
as
it
warms
it
opens
up
a
bit
more
but
still
not
superimpressed
i
must
also
say
that
i
felt
pretty
much
the
same
way
about
don
de
dieu
and
damnation
two
other
highly
rated
belgian
strong
pales
good
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
over
something
like
nb
trippel
or
gd
orabelle
great
interpretation
of
the
style
poured
into
a
chalice
from
the
12
oz
bottle
crazily
enough
i
first
smelt
heineken
when
i
got
close
but
that
soon
changed
apple
and
some
yeasty
tones
soon
came
out
the
taste
is
much
the
same
very
much
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
the
abv
taste
and
smell
was
none
existent
which
i
loved
goes
down
smooth
even
with
the
presence
of
good
carbonation
also
will
certainly
buy
again
in
the
future
othis
was
a
great
beer
to
relax
and
watch
some
football
i
so
wanted
to
love
this
beer
as
a
huge
fan
of
old
rasputin
as
so
many
on
here
are
i
had
high
expectations
especially
since
i
love
this
style
duvel
tremens
and
don
de
dieu
are
among
my
favorite
beers
and
indeed
it
had
a
nice
start
the
beer
looked
beautiful
in
my
large
wine
glass
great
hazy
golden
straw
color
huge
foamy
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
but
the
smell
was
just
ok
if
not
a
bit
on
the
funky
side
as
for
taste
something
was
clearly
lacking
it
seemed
to
need
more
sweetness
a
little
less
dryness
on
the
finish
more
oomph
i
kept
hoping
it
would
improve
as
it
warmed
but
any
flavor
bump
was
very
subtle
the
mouthfeel
was
a
different
matter
if
the
taste
matched
the
feel
this
beer
would
have
been
great
nice
and
creamy
full
very
smooth
ill
give
this
beer
another
try
and
im
hoping
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
im
a
little
disappointed
i
have
tried
to
clone
this
beer
several
times
and
have
barely
gotten
close
such
a
complex
but
simple
drink
the
abv
is
nicely
cloaked
by
the
flavors
of
the
hops
in
this
beer
and
is
so
drinkable
a
great
brew
any
time
of
the
year
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
i
will
continue
to
pursue
with
my
home
brewing
this
beer
is
short
on
flavor
and
body
and
it
also
has
that
weird
finish
not
sure
what
to
place
the
end
as
but
its
funky
and
strange
to
me
taste
very
light
and
crisp
it
has
a
nice
flavor
that
is
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
but
it
is
not
overpowering
it
finishes
up
nicely
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
o
so
elegant
in
its
balance
id
definitely
drink
this
again
drinks
so
well
on
its
own
almost
like
a
tripel
or
doppelbock
very
satisfying
yet
not
very
heavy
the
feel
is
very
full
very
crisp
and
smooth
north
coast
always
does
good
work
but
this
is
really
well
done
o
really
really
solid
beer
here
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
not
extremely
light
there
is
enough
body
here
to
make
it
just
a
little
heavier
than
a
session
beer
plus
the
over
7
abv
no
taste
of
alcohol
and
dangerously
drinkable
o
overall
a
delightful
belgian
golden
ale
absolutely
delicious
i
would
drink
this
again
as
someone
who
was
unfamiliar
with
north
coast
i
came
away
highly
impressed
by
this
offering
and
plan
to
try
more
soon
the
belgian
strong
was
right
in
my
wheel
house
so
any
fan
of
this
style
should
like
pranqster
very
much
excellent
beer
overall
a
beer
id
been
curious
about
for
a
while
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
very
enjoyable
thanks
to
the
spicy
nose
and
a
beautiful
body
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
by
the
time
i
got
half
way
through
the
beer
it
was
perfectly
still
that
aside
an
easy
to
find
and
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
well
crafted
belgian
ale
very
drinkable
4
5
out
of
5
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
moms
doing
well
o
cant
go
wrong
with
this
belgian
try
it
and
youll
agree
wow
this
one
blew
me
away
i
was
expecting
a
good
ale
based
on
the
reviews
but
wow
fruit
and
honey
notes
strong
alcohol
at
7
8
and
a
nice
feeling
afterward
belgian
ales
are
my
favorite
and
i
like
finding
an
american
beer
that
is
up
there
with
chimay
and
duvel
which
are
of
course
gifts
from
god
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
great
taste
and
smooth
i
love
the
flavor
when
i
first
had
it
i
feel
in
love
with
it
i
am
happy
that
publix
started
to
carry
it
i
have
only
had
in
bottles
even
the
bar
that
i
discovered
this
greatness
at
only
severed
in
bottles
if
you
are
out
with
some
friends
pick
this
brew
up
and
have
a
taste
overall
great
beer
my
dad
and
i
picked
this
up
at
trader
joes
one
day
and
thought
to
try
it
cloudy
pour
no
head
smells
like
sewer
water
and
called
pranqster
should
i
be
surprised
that
this
isnt
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
not
sure
who
has
rated
this
beer
highly
because
it
really
has
nothing
to
offer
other
than
it
has
a
nice
light
feel
in
the
mouth
and
the
taste
does
not
linger
i
really
try
to
appreciate
the
positive
attributes
of
every
beer
but
this
one
really
challenges
me
at
least
it
has
a
7
6
alcohol
content
bottom
line
they
named
this
beer
perfectly
i
wont
fall
for
their
joke
twice
though
odmy
palate
doesnt
always
agree
with
belgian
pales
this
one
i
enjoyed
with
ease
a
pretty
tasty
take
on
the
style
overall
quite
good
only
complaint
is
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
odd
beer
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
not
push
this
beer
on
others
an
acquired
taste
o
well
made
easy
enjoyable
to
drink
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
if
youre
into
belgian
golden
ales
try
this
beer
you
will
enjoy
it
well
crafted
not
controversial
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
that
could
easily
stand
up
to
the
beligum
boys
overall
it
is
just
a
very
pleasant
beer
beer
goes
with
a
little
rock
and
roll
todd
rundgrens
beatlesque
deface
the
music
would
be
an
excellent
complement
to
this
beer
north
coast
does
it
again
7
6
abv
taste
some
bitter
hopps
at
the
very
front
of
the
mouth
at
first
taste
it
then
becomes
very
smooth
in
the
middle
and
leaves
a
sweet
taste
of
belgian
yeast
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
overly
hoppy
so
it
is
a
good
way
to
get
untrained
taste
buds
to
start
getting
acclimated
its
nice
to
see
some
of
our
american
breweries
producing
quality
belgian
style
ales
pranqster
is
one
that
competes
very
handily
with
those
coming
from
across
the
pond
the
fact
that
it
is
easy
to
find
is
a
bonus
i
actually
like
this
ale
better
than
duvel
the
flavors
of
pranqster
are
a
little
bolder
thanks
to
the
belgian
yeast
funk

i
highly
recommend
picking
this
up
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
a
solid
american
version
of
a
bspa
moreys
bottom
line
this
beer
taste
like
a
tripel
to
me
which
isnt
my
favorite
style
that
being
said
ive
had
enough
of
them
to
know
that
this
is
indeed
a
good
one
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
od
really
liking
this
one
the
perfect
balance
of
flavor
alcohol
and
carbonation
we
got
a
great
deal
on
this
one
will
buy
again
definitely
worth
trying
and
comes
highly
recommended
o
eh
its
good
but
its
nothing
special
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
with
nothing
remarkable
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
dont
foresee
myself
purchasing
another
bottle
i
know
its
mainstream
but
i
would
probably
buy
a
duvel
instead
pours
an
apricotorange
color
w
a
one
finger
white
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
on
the
snifter
glass
a
little
bit
hazy
cloudy
in
appearance
nose
is
coriander
peach
orange
clove
and
some
yeast
the
nose
is
really
nice
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
if
i
closed
my
eyes
this
could
be
a
belgian
beer
off
the
nose
apricot
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
along
w
the
nose
profile
characters
its
good
just
a
little
on
the
fruit
juice
side
of
things
in
regard
to
sweetness
and
consistency
feel
is
very
sweetsmooth
w
a
medium
body
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
spices
really
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
and
linger
forever
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
cheers
overall
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
low
alcohol
feeling
in
each
drink
really
solid
one
of
the
best
american
examples
of
a
strong
ale
pours
a
completely
opaque
deep
honey
color
a
whitish
ring
stays
smell
is
very
fresh
and
leafy
but
not
in
the
detritus
sense
also
some
moderate
spiciness
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
spices
such
as
clove
clean
toasted
malts
and
delicate
sour
citrusy
hops
feel
is
crisp
and
lively
finishes
creamy
and
smooth
very
fine
brew
here
near
the
top
of
its
class
for
sure
imo
i
really
liked
this
beer
id
like
to
give
it
a
higher
rating
as
i
am
writing
this
the
next
day
but
i
have
to
keep
my
original
rating
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
fits
the
style
well
really
a
no
frills
belgian
that
just
simply
fits
the
bill
the
other
great
things
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
easy
to
find
and
it
is
very
affordable
for
what
it
is
m
light
and
wellcarbonated
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
copper
color
with
finger
and
a
half
of
head
dissipated
quickly
but
leaves
some
lace
citrus
in
the
smell
a
pleasant
fruity
malt
odor
the
citrus
is
there
in
the
taste
too
balanced
with
the
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
heavier
than
a
wit
but
lighter
than
most
pale
ales
i
like
this
one
alot
next
weekend
ill
be
passing
some
of
these
around
to
my
friends
and
daring
them
to
top
it
thanks
north
coast
o
no
real
big
flavors
but
what
is
there
runs
the
gamet
for
a
complex
tasteing
beer
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
you
get
them
all
this
is
quite
a
fine
beer
cheers
o
very
floral
and
thick
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
hazy
golden
color
and
nectary
spicy
smell
make
me
think
belgian
trippel
though
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
it
is
immediately
dry
to
the
taste
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hops
compared
to
other
california
beers
the
hops
are
delicately
blended
within
the
other
flavors
instead
of
being
a
separate
presence
from
everything
else
that
is
happening
on
the
palate
spicy
phenols
are
constant
as
is
some
fusel
one
can
tell
all
the
sugar
has
been
converted
in
this
beer
finishes
warm
and
dry
overall
a
great
beer
that
anyone
can
afford
and
find
pretty
easily
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
there
is
a
little
bit
of
funky
flavor
to
it
that
made
it
a
little
hard
to
finish
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
it
probably
isnt
one
i
am
going
to
add
to
my
daily
drinker
list
o
quite
the
great
take
on
a
belgian
golden
ale
i
will
definitely
buy
again
this
beer
is
ridiculously
good
they
have
the
posters
for
it
in
the
bathroom
at
my
local
bww
buffalo
wild
wings
and
ill
be
sure
to
get
this
there
next
time
with
my
garlic
parmesean
wings
8
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
with
its
balance
this
has
got
to
be
the
one
to
introduce
soneone
to
the
belgium
style
balance
overall
i
love
that
belgian
yeasty
taste
just
pops
in
your
mouth
great
with
baked
chicken
would
definitely
drink
again
no
pranq
here
just
fine
drinking
pleasure
overrall
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
although
the
only
other
beer
ive
had
from
north
coast
is
old
rasputin
i
feel
compelled
to
explore
their
lineup
because
both
offerings
have
been
excellent
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
im
really
wondering
why
im
not
enjoying
this
one
considering
i
have
in
the
past
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
this
is
still
a
beer
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
its
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
hazy
yellow
pour
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
sweet
light
fruit
notes
the
taste
has
prominent
belgian
yeast
sweet
peach
it
finishes
with
lots
of
sweet
yeast
dry
finish
a
good
beer
solid
belgian
pale
ale
o
big
fan
of
the
style
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
would
drink
it
again
as
a
session
though
will
not
buy
again
o
this
beer
is
going
to
pull
me
more
into
belgian
beers
i
really
was
surprised
how
much
i
liked
it
easy
drinking
here
could
easily
down
another
pint
o
pranqster
isnt
a
beer
i
drink
all
that
often
but
i
really
dont
know
why
its
damn
good
and
always
available
overall
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
i
can
see
this
appealing
to
a
wide
audience
because
it
isnt
quite
as
funky
as
traditional
belgians
and
it
has
a
nice
approachable
flavor
i
would
appreciate
an
improvement
in
the
looks
department
though
o
a
very
sessionable
brewski
clean
complex
and
smooth
o
drinkable
but
the
overly
forward
apple
character
turned
me
off
of
this
one
it
just
feels
unbalanced
some
of
the
complexity
im
looking
for
is
there
in
the
background
but
its
understated
with
aging
a
little
more
attenuation
and
higher
carbonation
i
think
id
appreciate
this
beer
more
this
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
white
head
which
doesnt
seem
to
have
good
retention
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
funk
some
fruity
notes
like
banana
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
some
banana
its
a
little
earthy
a
little
spice
and
pepper
and
it
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
bite
and
some
dryness
some
complexity
there
overall
this
is
a
fine
american
belgian
i
like
the
ommegang
bpa
a
little
more
but
this
is
a
brew
which
id
definitely
get
again
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
soft
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
a
decent
strong
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
especially
if
your
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
this
was
a
tad
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
but
i
never
felt
that
it
overpowered
the
taste
theres
not
doubt
that
this
beer
can
match
up
to
duvel
or
any
other
imported
belgian
strong
pale
ale
fans
of
belgian
beers
will
not
be
disappointed
in
this
offering
and
may
be
surprised
to
find
out
that
its
from
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
north
coast
has
a
winner
here
thats
a
textbook
example
of
this
style
m
medium
bodied
nice
biscuity
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
help
keep
the
palate
refreshed
very
light
alcohol
burn
but
not
boozy
whatsoever
m
nice
balance
good
carbonation
full
body
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
winner
a
nice
beer
overall
very
refreshing
and
tasty
with
all
the
belgian
characteristics
it
has
going
on
another
trader
joes
random
single
good
times
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
topped
by
a
solid
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
clove
black
pepper
belgian
yeast
orange
peel
light
cucumber
banana
and
a
touch
of
white
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
coriander
vanilla
very
light
caramel
and
a
dash
of
ginger
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
bspa
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
generally
enjoyable
decent
but
i
sense
some
homerism
from
reviewers
south
of
the
49th
here
a
big
bold
yet
refreshing
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
from
the
yeast
really
well
crafted
delicious
another
quality
brew
from
north
coast
pours
a
hazy
darker
amber
with
fizzy
instafade
white
head
a
couple
of
tiny
blobs
of
lace
left
behind
smell
sweet
white
grape
juice
floral
and
spicy
hopping
grainy
a
little
watered
down
clove
a
little
windex
taste
reasonably
sweet
pale
malt
backbone
grainy
moderately
spicy
with
a
little
pepper
hit
fruity
white
plum
slightly
medicinal
in
the
finish
drying
semisticky
its
pleasant
but
not
great
by
any
means
o
tasty
north
coast
is
wellrespected
among
beer
drinkers
and
rightly
so
for
me
this
ale
ranks
towards
the
top
overall
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
bspa
i
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
it
overall
a
good
spicy
belgian
style
ale
that
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
overall
id
go
with
this
one
again
thumbs
up
great
example
of
this
style
o
this
was
a
tasty
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
or
depth
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
no
offflavors
and
still
quite
enjoyable
i
have
a
friend
who
is
new
to
the
world
of
craft
beers
and
i
think
this
will
be
a
good
one
for
her
to
try
and
if
she
doesnt
like
it
ill
be
quite
happy
to
finish
it
for
her
o
an
excellent
belgianstyle
ale
it
is
hearty
flavorful
and
refreshing
its
drinkability
isnt
quite
up
to
par
as
other
beers
of
its
type
but
it
has
to
be
the
best
most
affordable
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ales
available
on
this
side
of
the
country
poured
by
the
bartender
into
a
pilsner
glass
whatever
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
layer
of
milky
head
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
with
a
bit
of
funk
bready
with
light
notes
of
fruit
and
spice
tastes
kind
of
like
a
tripel
in
some
ways
belgian
yeast
biscuits
candi
sugar
banana
esters
with
hints
of
apricots
medium
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
of
film
in
the
mouth
flavorful
and
pretty
drinkable
serving
type
on
draft
this
is
the
best
beer
of
my
life
so
far
it
is
the
most
delicious
most
powerful
and
satisfying
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
drinking
it
in
a
duvel
tulip
glass
and
i
got
it
at
whole
foods
for
5
99
a
bottle
in
long
beach
ca
i
will
drink
it
anytime
it
is
available
over
any
other
beer
a
solid
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bite
with
carbonation
to
cut
through
any
syrup
nonsense
this
gives
the
beer
a
light
yet
strong
flavor
worthy
of
a
taste
though
maybe
not
the
a
the
bros
gave
serving
type
bottle
taste
is
apples
and
pears
with
a
sharp
crisp
bite
more
yeast
this
is
dry
and
refreshing
good
but
nothing
especially
interesting
or
unique
overall
nice
example
full
carbonation
an
easy
going
belgian
strong
pale
this
is
a
really
solid
belgianstyle
pale
though
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
straight
pale
like
brugse
zot
then
a
drier
strong
pale
like
duvel
still
really
enjoying
this
one
perhaps
a
bit
more
body
would
put
it
right
to
the
top
for
me
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
summer
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
drinks
like
something
5
an
awesome
purchase
at
9
for
a
4pk
overall
drinkability
is
ok
but
really
not
my
favorite
as
far
a
flavor
combinations
go
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
slightly
more
than
a
suggestion
of
light
tan
head
aromas
of
candi
sugar
belgian
yeast
and
bubble
gum
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkable
and
wellmade
with
flavors
of
belgian
yeast
candi
sugar
and
some
fruitiness
o
a
worthy
beer
and
definitely
something
i
am
glad
to
of
tried
but
not
in
my
top
tier
of
the
style
too
much
carbonation
very
light
body
this
brew
pours
a
murky
honey
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
some
sporadic
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
typically
belgium
with
hints
of
bready
maltsfruity
yeast
and
banannasit
has
a
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
sweet
raisin
breadredgum
honeybanannas
in
cream
and
finshed
with
a
floralfruity
hoppy
dryness
and
overall
a
nice
drop
thats
quite
tasty
this
is
a
really
excellent
american
made
belgian
pale
very
affordable
lots
of
taste
fairly
complex
its
not
blowing
me
away
or
anything
but
this
is
just
solid
all
around
really
no
complaints
at
all
o
solid
buy
will
go
back
for
more
a
stronger
hop
presence
i
would
love
although
that
would
get
away
from
the
representation
of
the
style
which
is
does
rather
well
this
brew
reminds
me
of
candyland
or
candylane
the
board
game
and
i
hate
that
game
good
thing
i
love
the
beer
drink
it
ya
prick
a
top
choice
for
as
strong
pale
and
it
isnt
super
heavy
on
the
abv
ill
be
hitting
this
brew
up
more
often
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
through
the
spices
i
could
see
how
this
could
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
nevertheless
i
will
definitely
have
more
of
these
soon
overall
pretty
good
for
the
category
i
like
duvel
better
but
this
wins
in
price
this
encourages
you
to
drink
it
much
slower
than
duvel
does
my
guess
would
be
it
has
less
or
none
belgian
candy
sugar
than
duvel
a
solid
brew
that
i
would
consider
getting
again
this
is
a
nice
fresh
beer
i
wanted
a
beer
today
that
wasnt
as
potent
as
an
ipa
this
falls
nice
on
the
tounge
as
well
has
a
citrus
oak
taste
color
is
nice
and
gold
but
transparent
good
for
a
cloudy
hungover
afternoon
i
have
to
say
for
being
such
an
above
abv
it
taste
very
light
and
quite
smooth
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
good
goto
for
a
belgian
golden
not
bizarrenor
prohibitively
complex
this
brew
came
to
me
on
tap
at
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
and
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
for
a
while
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
from
what
i
could
tell
the
head
was
thin
and
left
just
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
and
mostly
made
up
of
belgian
yeast
aromas
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
what
i
thought
was
pretty
standardto
the
style
it
was
big
ion
the
bread
yeast
flavors
which
brought
along
some
banana
and
clove
the
hops
werent
overly
powerful
here
this
brew
was
overall
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
creating
an
authentic
belgian
ale
i
just
wasnt
overly
thrilled
by
it
overall
i
had
this
once
in
the
bottle
and
wasnt
nearly
impressed
one
things
for
sure
tho
its
bomb
on
draft
it
has
the
classic
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
is
very
smooth
a
definate
spice
flavor
coriander
among
others
very
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
id
have
this
anytime
it
is
available
pours
a
hazy
amber
to
orange
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
behind
nose
is
yeasty
bready
and
wheats
some
banana
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
bready
malts
and
a
subtle
hop
finish
spices
are
also
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
carbonation
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
good
but
it
was
not
amazing
i
want
this
brew
to
go
one
of
two
ways
either
have
a
bigger
malt
presence
or
have
a
lower
alcohol
content
to
be
more
of
a
session
beer
i
think
if
the
alcohol
was
better
hidden
it
would
be
a
better
brew
but
thats
just
me
that
being
said
drinkability
was
good
overall
bubbles
are
strong
dry
cleansing
and
champagne
crisp
little
stickier
than
duvel
lingers
a
bit
notes
great
beer
with
seamless
complexity
and
great
drinkability
at
under
6
for
a
22oz
bottle
its
a
great
value
too
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
i
cant
count
how
many
times
ive
passed
it
up
on
the
shelf
before
i
gave
it
a
try
it
was
well
worth
it
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
golden
yellow
color
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
breadybiscuity
up
front
with
spices
and
floral
nature
in
the
back
tastes
like
the
same
bread
and
biscuits
to
begin
with
more
floral
and
some
pine
bitterness
to
finish
feel
is
amply
carbonated
and
crisp
almost
dry
overall
a
good
beer
though
i
tend
to
appreciate
a
little
more
smoothness
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
honestly
caught
me
by
surprise
it
was
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
more
north
coast
is
really
a
versatile
brewery
overall
i
dont
love
this
as
much
as
others
seem
to
great
brewer
to
be
sure
but
this
one
is
lacking
compared
to
other
belgians
id
rather
have
a
duvel
or
don
de
dieu
or
matilda
o
outstanding
beer
would
definatly
recommend
to
anyone
o
a
tasty
belgian
with
some
definite
fruit
characteristics
though
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
cider
the
higher
abv
is
nicely
hidden
and
it
would
make
an
ideal
summer
patio
drink
overall
solid
but
its
not
duvel
though
not
much
is
thanks
kybrewgrass
for
this
one
d
4
5
i
finished
this
brew
too
fast
that
was
a
mistake
i
want
more
of
it
this
ale
has
a
very
good
aroma
and
taste
and
each
is
wellbalanced
i
could
session
this
beer
for
sure
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
try
if
you
can
obtain
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
on
sale
love
how
the
clove
is
muted
different
from
most
american
belgians
i
also
loved
the
vanilla
notes
as
soon
as
the
beer
hits
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
subtle
fruit
tones
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
flavor
up
front
but
thins
out
and
disappears
in
the
feel
as
it
warms
further
the
flavor
returns
with
a
smooth
balanced
character
theres
no
alcohol
or
strong
yeast
flavors
which
makes
for
a
balanced
and
decent
beer
i
would
sum
this
up
as
the
poor
mans
delerium
tremens
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
d
not
bad
not
great
a
good
drinkable
belgian
but
not
exceptional
overall
decent
ale
cant
say
that
ive
ever
had
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
it
was
alright
wouldnt
have
shocked
me
if
this
was
a
belgian
white
style
beer
cant
say
it
was
a
ale
ill
be
having
again
it
might
have
been
too
high
of
an
abv
for
this
ale
being
at
a
7
6
will
be
trying
in
bottle
sometime
soon
and
give
it
another
chance
pranqster
left
me
feeling
tricked
its
just
too
light
in
flavor
for
me
and
theres
no
depth
or
complexity
d
very
nice
beverage
one
you
can
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
fanfriggintastic
strong
spicy
yet
very
smooth
and
no
hop
which
i
enjoy
phenomenal
beer
serve
very
chilled
doesnt
seem
to
have
that
metallic
taste
that
some
hefs
tend
to
have
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgianstyle
golden
beers
been
drinking
alot
of
belgian
style
beer
lately
and
this
one
poured
well
nice
light
orangered
color
with
ample
frothing
that
dissipated
and
left
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
not
much
of
a
smell
and
not
any
real
big
flavors
other
than
a
peppery
warming
with
faint
malt
and
some
light
hopdryness
on
the
back
end
a
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
and
it
was
nice
but
after
having
some
of
the
best
belgian
style
beer
out
there
this
one
was
just
ok
overall
a
good
bspa
but
the
only
problem
with
this
style
is
that
every
one
made
seems
to
be
overshadowed
by
duvel
nothing
seems
to
come
close
to
the
original
drinkability
very
high
and
easy
drinkability
at
20
ibus
will
return
to
again
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
beer
its
just
flat
out
great
i
have
to
have
it
again
drinkibility
this
one
is
way
up
there
on
drinkibility
with
its
lower
price
and
level
setting
quality
this
one
is
a
go
to
for
me
pours
a
yeasty
pale
yellow
with
ample
carbonation
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
citrus
sweet
malt
and
faint
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
due
to
the
carbonation
with
belgian
yeast
malt
citrus
and
a
faint
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
high
d
this
is
my
fav
beer
in
this
style
soo
far
got
this
beer
to
end
the
night
and
man
did
i
wish
i
would
of
started
with
it
so
i
could
have
had
2
more
loved
how
the
spices
and
sweetness
mixed
well
and
the
sent
was
heavenly
will
grab
this
beer
again
dig
it
the
most
i
has
this
on
tap
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
but
was
a
little
disappointed
not
that
is
a
a
bad
beer
but
rather
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
average
the
malt
character
was
there
as
was
the
belgium
spice
but
i
didnt
get
any
strong
pale
ale
from
the
beer
maybe
it
was
a
fluke
but
i
feel
like
it
need
to
give
this
one
another
try
just
to
make
sure
overall
just
a
little
better
than
average
this
a
solid
beer
for
sure
but
doesnt
really
feel
like
a
strong
pale
ale
to
me
feels
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
with
that
said
its
good
tasty
and
totally
worthwhile
if
you
likey
the
belgy
brew
okay
other
than
hefes
belgium
ales
are
probably
my
least
favorite
style
of
beer
however
in
attempt
to
broaden
my
pallet
ive
decided
to
take
on
a
new
style
i
find
the
pranqster
to
be
a
decent
beer
with
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
flavors
are
not
my
favorite
but
for
someone
who
likes
this
style
of
brew
im
sure
it
will
be
a
fantastic
beer
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
can
definitely
tell
its
a
well
crafted
beer
d
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
impressive
brew
and
drinkable
great
effervescent
taste
and
feel
poured
a
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
strawlike
malts
floral
hops
and
earthy
yeast
with
notes
on
fruit
it
tasted
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
beginning
and
matured
into
a
sweetsour
flavor
with
hints
of
dried
fruits
that
stayed
with
you
for
a
nice
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
dry
in
texture
overall
a
nice
refreshing
belgian
ale
highly
drinkable
smooth
as
silk
and
really
really
tasty
i
could
see
myself
going
here
often
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
bspa
d
overall
great
drink
easy
to
enjoy
which
makes
it
perfect
for
any
beer
lover
a
bit
thin
on
texture
its
lack
of
flavor
bite
is
actually
not
a
weak
point
for
this
beer
which
means
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
to
get
the
most
out
of
every
sip
d
drinkable
but
a
little
fizzy
belching
is
a
must
was
pretty
good
with
my
whole
wheat
pizza
with
bacon
crumbles
a
good
solid
belgian
style
beer
even
the
wife
liked
this
one
she
tries
them
all
doesnt
like
many
but
shows
good
taste
with
the
ones
she
likes
d
this
was
a
decent
belgian
pale
with
standard
scent
and
taste
it
was
very
clean
but
the
body
wasnt
great
alcohol
was
well
hidden
though
so
it
was
generally
easy
to
drink
it
just
wasnt
unique
or
memorable
id
definitely
recommend
one
for
a
cold
winter
afternoon
or
even
a
warm
afternoon
in
southern
california
it
just
begs
for
attention
recommended
beer
to
try
and
give
more
than
one
chance
im
glad
i
didnt
write
it
off
and
came
back
to
it
i
think
i
just
wasnt
acustomed
to
belgian
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
dthe
tastes
dont
hold
up
well
they
gain
some
offflavors
it
seems
its
an
okay
beer
but
it
didnt
go
down
easily
this
isnt
something
ill
want
again
appearance
is
a
light
golden
color
with
some
cloudiness
small
head
its
smell
contains
belgian
yeast
lemon
banana
and
some
spice
cloves
i
think
the
aroma
was
enjoyable
and
built
positive
expectations
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
tasting
this
strong
pale
ale
did
not
disappoint
very
nice
citrus
flavor
yeast
still
there
along
with
candy
and
spice
in
the
finish
mf
is
a
tad
bubbly
which
i
really
like
about
this
style
and
pranqster
drinks
easier
than
other
similar
beers
with
the
abv
under
8
this
batch
felt
a
little
flat
goes
down
really
well
though
and
doesnt
become
cloying
at
all
overall
ive
learned
not
to
expect
very
much
from
americanmade
belgianstyle
beers
but
this
is
certainly
an
exception
worth
a
shot
overall
an
excellent
bspa
that
i
highly
recommend
been
eyeing
this
for
a
long
time
but
never
pulled
the
trigger
till
now
glad
i
did
this
might
be
the
beer
to
get
me
back
into
the
belgian
pales
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
earns
a
spot
in
the
mixed
six
and
ontap
oy
taste
is
all
bananas
and
clove
some
other
spice
notes
come
into
the
background
but
cant
identify
a
delicious
floral
and
fruity
taste
hovers
throughout
d
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
youd
never
know
this
clocks
in
at
nearly
8
abv
goes
down
like
candy
all
night
drinker
no
worries
d
this
is
a
good
attempt
to
recreate
a
belgian
classic
while
it
falls
short
of
the
real
thing
in
a
few
places
it
is
still
a
superb
beer
that
deserves
mention
a
nice
evenly
rendered
and
enjoyable
new
world
take
on
a
classic
belgian
bigboy
pale
ale
lots
going
on
and
easy
enough
to
put
back
yet
the
jokes
on
you
if
you
treat
this
like
you
would
any
normal
4pack
as
far
as
value
its
considerably
cheaper
than
duvel
where
i
am
so
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
i
pay
8
99
for
a
duvel
this
size
whereas
this
750ml
was
4
69
ironically
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
twice
the
price
of
duvel
at
a
bar
in
antwerp
i
might
prefer
duvel
slightly
if
you
made
me
choose
but
maybe
thats
because
ive
been
drinking
it
longer
congrats
to
nc
on
this
one
theyve
shown
rare
prowess
among
americans
in
the
belgian
beer
foray
d
all
night
and
all
day
this
is
robust
yet
light
almost
a
bit
of
a
cider
note
d
a
real
treat
very
complex
and
sublte
easy
to
drink
but
be
careful
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
d
this
tastes
great
and
has
a
way
of
going
down
easy
for
the
price
its
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
very
nice
brew
i
tend
to
love
anything
of
the
belgian
school
and
this
is
a
good
american
example
decent
drink
ability
to
it
although
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
cloudy
gold
color
generous
head
effervescent
and
fizzy
pour
smells
of
orange
yeast
flowers
bright
clean
rich
flavor
yeasty
typical
of
the
style
very
lively
and
smooth
mouthfeel
flavors
of
orange
honey
slight
grapefruit
caramel
hinted
at
in
the
background
vanilla
very
slight
whiff
of
clovemild
spice
and
cream
a
real
treat
dtheres
a
bite
at
the
end
of
this
similar
to
drinking
a
soda
so
i
cant
see
me
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
that
being
said
its
a
wonderful
beer
for
sipping
on
while
conversing
with
a
friend
not
overly
impressed
here
when
compared
to
greater
belgian
strongs
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
by
any
measure
its
just
rather
plain
this
is
often
compared
to
duvel
but
for
my
money
this
is
worlds
more
complex
and
enjoyable
pranqster
was
hazy
and
light
orange
in
color
it
had
a
short
white
head
that
didnt
last
with
little
lacing
the
smell
was
yeast
fruit
and
light
malt
the
taste
was
peppery
spices
and
yeast
flavors
with
some
sweetness
upfront
and
drying
out
in
the
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
nice
belgian
ale
and
well
worth
a
try
very
nice
example
of
the
style
a
bit
more
fruity
than
duvel
with
less
of
a
hoppy
aftertaste
i
really
cant
find
any
major
flaws
with
this
one
very
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
i
am
going
to
have
to
try
more
of
this
it
may
end
up
being
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
was
hard
to
drink
due
to
its
sweetness
very
cloying
just
not
my
glass
of
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
overall
flavors
are
good
but
not
quite
up
to
the
best
in
the
category
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
overall
it
works
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
for
more
of
this
the
finish
is
that
of
a
clove
studded
banana
cream
pie
balance
is
there
though
a
slight
warming
sensation
from
the
booze
does
seep
through
poured
from
the
tap
a
nice
yellowcopper
color
with
a
bright
white
active
head
that
disapated
into
nice
lacings
for
much
of
the
beer
smell
is
malty
buiscuty
and
a
little
horseygrainy
which
i
presume
is
the
yeast
taste
is
light
spicinesscorriander
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
actually
was
expecting
more
taste
and
felt
it
was
a
little
watery
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
good
balance
of
active
carbonation
for
its
a
abv
its
a
very
drinkable
belgian
simple
and
clean
and
refreshing
it
drinks
fine
but
with
less
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
little
more
richness
each
sip
would
leave
you
anticipating
the
next
as
it
is
i
dont
dread
the
next
sip
but
im
not
anxious
for
it
poured
a
yellowish
orange
with
pale
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
big
on
the
citrus
with
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
belgian
yeast
notes
it
had
bubble
gum
notes
as
well
the
taste
was
also
pretty
citrusy
with
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
lots
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
however
i
still
detected
bubble
gum
candy
notes
on
the
palate
it
was
medium
inbody
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
malty
citrusy
silky
and
sticky
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
and
was
a
decent
belgian
offering
from
north
coast
overall
very
drinkable
for
a
belgian
ale
still
not
my
favourite
style
though
drinkability
is
ok
make
the
beer
dryer
and
they
have
a
winner
too
sweet
i
would
grab
a
duvel
dwhat
all
others
in
the
style
should
aim
for
i
love
this
beer
a
good
belgian
style
ale
but
i
like
too
many
others
much
more
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
in
the
flavor
compared
to
some
others
still
a
really
fine
effort
by
north
coast
d
enjoyable
refreshing
and
playfully
simple
drinkability
very
tasty
and
complex
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
because
the
flavors
just
jump
here
i
will
certainly
get
this
again
slightly
hazy
gold
to
orange
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
white
with
not
a
lot
of
retention
spicy
nose
mostly
of
clove
theres
also
candylike
sugars
banana
oranges
and
some
apple
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
except
that
the
fruit
is
more
prominent
sweetness
is
a
bit
in
your
face
initially
lots
of
fruity
notes
a
bit
of
an
inkling
of
juicy
fruit
gum
some
warming
alcohol
on
the
end
and
then
the
sweetness
kicks
back
in
and
lingers
lots
of
carbonation
helped
this
to
go
down
easier
for
me
d
great
for
the
abv
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
beers
d
smooth
refreshing
intricate
delicious
the
taste
to
me
is
a
crisp
blend
of
malted
sweetness
slight
hop
flavor
and
present
but
not
overbearing
alcohol
finish
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
particularly
as
it
warms
up
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
try
this
again
because
nothing
really
stood
out
as
being
interesting
in
the
taste
0
even
though
many
aspects
are
disappointing
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
compared
to
its
european
counterparts
its
dead
in
the
water
overall
good
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
seems
to
fit
nicely
in
the
style
i
personally
liked
the
lack
of
a
strong
herbal
dry
finish
that
some
belgians
leave
this
seemed
very
balanced
and
very
good
though
not
great
in
almost
every
category
d
drinkable
and
then
some
this
may
be
my
new
north
coast
go
to
beer
pours
a
goldenbronze
colored
ale
with
a
nice
bright
egg
white
colored
foamy
head
which
slowly
dissolves
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
fresh
pears
anyone
great
pear
aroma
with
some
slight
apple
whiffs
light
malt
in
the
aroma
also
malty
taste
with
some
spicy
tones
on
the
swallow
followed
by
a
nice
fruity
orange
aftertaste
slight
spice
in
the
mouth
well
after
the
swallow
dry
mouthfeel
but
just
keeps
the
buds
wanting
more
i
took
down
a
750
with
no
problems
whatsoever
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
and
widely
available
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
to
drink
in
the
coming
weeks
d
good
drinkability
wish
i
had
a
few
more
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
hop
quality
isnt
unwelcome
but
the
balance
could
be
shifted
a
bit
more
toward
the
malt
the
yeast
esters
are
lacking
here
from
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
as
well
the
head
retention
is
really
lacking
as
well
in
comparison
notes
grainy
flavors
were
pretty
dominant
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
fruitiness
was
present
just
not
as
much
as
i
would
necessarily
like
also
a
touch
thin
for
the
style
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
though
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
style
really
great
belgian
by
a
us
brewer
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
nice
sugary
tones
head
dissipates
quickly
nice
bronze
color
alcohol
is
apparent
right
into
your
first
sip
kind
of
wished
it
was
smoother
like
the
other
belgians
i
have
had
this
isnt
a
great
one
but
in
my
opinion
it
isnt
a
bad
one
at
all
kind
of
in
the
middle
for
me
d
i
think
this
is
a
brew
i
could
drink
all
day
long
im
very
impressed
by
this
interpretation
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
i
could
see
myself
stocking
this
as
a
regular
staple
in
my
refrigerator
kudos
to
north
coast
very
nicely
crafted
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
this
is
a
truly
fantastic
beer
and
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
i
say
this
a
lot
about
certain
beers
where
the
summation
of
the
elements
make
for
a
greater
drink
than
the
individual
elements
deliver
a
delicious
example
here
d
great
deal
at
8
bucks
hard
to
find
another
8
dollar
750
that
has
this
much
flavor
i
am
not
sure
it
really
fits
the
style
though
pretty
drinkable
the
750ml
are
all
doable
alcohol
is
nicely
disguised
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
would
not
put
this
up
to
duvel
apples
and
oranges
in
my
opinion
so
although
im
of
the
opinion
that
they
have
ahem
adjusted
the
recipie
over
the
years
here
goes
pours
a
crisp
yellow
gold
with
amber
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
nor
lacing
fairly
well
carbonated
nose
bears
forth
cinnamon
belgian
yeastiness
cantaloupe
and
a
hint
of
pineapple
nose
is
subtle
however
gotta
kinda
search
for
it
flavor
is
exceptionally
well
balanced
between
the
yeast
and
malt
not
very
hoppy
the
cinnamon
and
cantaloupe
flavors
arethere
but
in
the
background
the
flavor
evolves
into
some
unique
stuff
hard
to
place
but
very
unique
rounded
of
by
a
very
clean
finish
that
makes
this
well
priced
beer
amazingly
quickdrinking
and
at
the
somewhat
high
abv
of
7
6
that
makes
this
one
dangerous
very
good
and
a
must
try
folks
12oz
bottle
i
agree
with
nate
and
have
used
some
of
the
words
in
his
description
great
tripel
aroma
sweet
honey
and
citrus
oil
candi
sugar
belgian
yeast
and
bit
of
funk
golden
amber
cloudy
with
thin
offwhite
head
medium
bodied
with
mediumheavy
carbonation
starts
with
grainy
sweetness
candi
sugar
funky
yeasty
chalk
and
light
honey
mild
fruity
hops
and
rind
bitter
in
the
finish
sweet
tripel
aftertase
nice
alcohol
warming
this
beer
is
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
tripel
the
high
carbonation
and
light
texture
make
if
very
drinkable
d
all
in
all
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
abv
is
moderately
high
but
it
is
well
incorporated
and
easily
managed
the
flavor
profile
is
fun
and
easily
reminiscient
of
a
belgian
ale
which
is
always
a
plus
its
really
not
bad
at
all
relatively
cheap
for
style
id
say
check
this
out
long
before
the
old
school
traditional
ones
from
across
the
pond
the
future
is
now
high
drinkability
even
over
7
d
good
since
it
is
so
clean
tasting
and
refreshing
but
not
a
5
only
because
of
the
7
6
abv
drinkability
is
good
smooth
enough
to
have
two
although
the
bottle
is
only
12
ounces
overall
impression
bitter
dry
belgian
wannabe
lacking
robust
body
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
good
carbonation
nice
contrast
excellent
balance
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
not
everyday
but
to
be
savored
on
occassion
d
a
heavyhanded
belgian
pale
at
nearly
8
abv
north
coast
pranqster
is
anotehr
solid
example
of
how
american
brewers
can
duplicate
that
classic
belgian
brewing
tradition
and
modify
the
yeasts
and
hop
to
create
something
different
and
truly
american
good
for
a
couple
but
the
fullon
belgian
flavor
and
abv
would
do
me
in
after
a
few
d
if
you
like
belgian
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
it
isnt
a
strict
adherent
to
style
guidelines
and
its
a
nice
take
on
golden
ale
i
like
the
lightness
that
the
carbonation
lends
to
this
7
abv
beer
its
something
of
a
champagne
effect
i
e
the
bubbles
give
you
something
of
a
head
rush
on
top
of
the
alcohol
buzz
i
think
one
is
all
that
i
could
have
the
horse
blanket
flavor
is
just
a
bit
much
for
me
i
am
just
very
sensitive
to
that
in
saisons
and
wild
ales
and
this
is
teetering
on
the
edge
d
i
have
yet
to
reach
the
stage
where
i
find
belgian
ales
as
drinkable
as
their
american
counterparts
this
may
change
over
time
nevertheless
i
find
that
the
flavors
dont
go
down
quite
as
smooth
to
my
taste
although
they
are
quite
appealing
the
taste
is
classic
belgian
bright
with
spiciness
plantains
and
a
hint
of
tree
nuts
and
a
good
cutting
of
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
however
and
this
beer
seems
hollow
on
the
swallow
good
carbonation
and
a
clean
character
but
overall
it
left
me
wanting
something
a
little
more
robust
to
fill
my
mouth
with
flavor
and
heft
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
tons
of
bubbles
very
well
carbonated
the
scent
is
sweet
and
a
bit
spicy
im
picking
up
pepper
mint
clove
and
a
little
oregano
maybe
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
lovely
initially
i
get
some
sweet
fruits
with
a
peppery
character
then
followed
by
tons
of
zesty
spices
while
still
remaining
sweet
and
crisp
at
the
end
i
get
flavors
from
the
belgian
yeasts
and
light
hop
character
this
beer
is
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
great
drinkability
this
beer
has
about
a
year
on
it
i
might
add
i
recently
tried
pranqster
for
the
first
time
last
weekend
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
impressed
i
had
to
buy
a
4
pack
the
next
day
d
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
years
ago
but
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
definately
worth
a
shot
d
moderate
drinkability
sneaky
abv
watch
out
smooth
flavors
but
just
a
hair
too
sweet
for
any
decent
sessioning
a
decent
belgianstyle
pale
ale
for
2
im
totally
happy
with
this
but
it
really
doesnt
excite
me
or
interest
me
very
much
as
something
feels
a
bit
off
with
it
still
it
was
nice
to
try
jd
dnot
my
favorite
of
the
belgian
styles
but
a
decent
one
to
try
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
dry
enough
though
for
me
d
it
is
a
filling
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
but
it
is
too
heavy
to
do
that
d
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
for
what
i
paid
i
could
get
much
better
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
its
definitely
a
good
drinker
taste
stronger
bitterness
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
far
from
overpowering
or
inappropriate
dry
with
an
herbal
spiciness
d
i
love
em
but
two
or
so
is
the
most
for
me
do
to
the
higher
abv
and
the
very
filling
nature
of
the
brew
pours
a
bright
amber
gold
opaque
smells
of
yeast
citrus
taste
is
complex
spicy
notes
of
orange
and
honey
gentle
nip
of
hops
and
a
bite
of
alcohol
this
does
not
have
the
supernova
burst
in
the
mouth
that
duvel
does
but
its
a
similar
and
slightly
more
pedestrian
brew
which
is
no
mean
achievement
md
light
bodied
and
crisp
carboantion
very
easy
drinking
cloudy
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
carries
estery
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
the
banana
clove
of
a
hefeweizen
flavor
displays
some
sweetness
though
smooth
butterscotch
wheatiness
with
a
slightly
boozy
warming
finish
a
great
goto
american
belgian
style
ale
if
i
had
to
complain
the
lack
of
head
and
retention
leaves
something
to
desire
other
than
that
this
is
a
topnotch
beer
md
a
pretty
good
belgian
strong
ale
almost
tripel
shows
some
decent
flavor
complexity
when
warming
to
room
temperature
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
makes
this
beer
easy
drinking
worth
the
9
a
4
pack
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
i
look
forward
to
the
other
two
i
stashed
away
for
a
future
date
cheers
to
all
d
highly
drinkable
ive
had
it
in
a
bottle
and
it
does
not
compare
to
draft
these
go
down
easy
and
leave
me
wanting
more
it
has
a
full
body
and
a
nice
warming
effect
its
probably
not
drinkable
in
sense
that
its
not
a
sessionable
beer
it
is
delicious
though
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
much
better
tasting
beer
than
duvel
good
alcohol
content
and
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
a
very
good
tasting
beer
and
the
taste
is
consistent
each
time
i
buy
it
if
available
id
try
this
before
the
highly
rated
duvel
and
compare
the
two
light
refresing
and
very
tasteful
with
no
hint
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
d
no
heat
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
7
6
belgian
style
golden
not
cloying
d
wished
it
had
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
flavors
abv
a
little
noticeable
i
have
other
belgians
i
would
choose
before
this
one
after
a
while
it
gets
more
bearable
but
this
seems
rather
unpleasantly
unbalanced
compared
to
most
belgian
style
ales
it
has
some
nice
characters
but
i
just
found
it
very
difficult
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
higher
abv
i
slowly
drank
it
so
im
not
sure
if
the
taste
gets
old
d
i
like
north
coast
beers
in
general
and
wanted
to
enjoy
this
but
i
keep
sensing
an
unpleasant
metallic
quality
in
the
beer
which
i
didnt
enjoy
hope
to
make
a
north
coast
tasting
next
week
and
perhaps
give
this
another
try
drinkability
relaxing
quite
good
with
a
meal
zucchini
cakes
and
seasoned
noodles
and
i
finished
it
quite
fast
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
feel
let
down
by
what
i
read
about
the
greatness
of
this
beer
in
some
of
the
other
reviews
either
i
have
a
beer
past
its
prime
or
im
just
not
getting
it
drinkability
very
high
drinkabiity
you
would
not
guess
that
the
abv
is
so
high
dangerous
beer
as
it
goes
down
like
juice
a
pleasant
belgian
to
sip
when
you
dont
feel
like
concentrating
too
hard
on
what
youre
enjoying
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
although
you
dont
really
notice
the
slightly
higher
abv
overall
pranqster
is
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
in
my
opinion
it
cant
hang
with
the
uppertier
of
that
which
belgium
has
to
offer
thats
no
to
say
this
isnt
a
good
beer
it
is
but
it
just
doesnt
retain
that
classic
vibe
that
you
find
in
belgians
of
the
same
style
im
being
harsh
though
this
is
an
enjoyable
take
on
a
fantastic
style
and
is
worthy
of
being
consumed
taste
is
very
nice
with
spice
and
fruit
like
apples
and
apricots
hints
of
malt
and
hops
with
an
overall
sweet
character
the
mouth
feel
is
not
carbonated
enough
this
is
and
the
head
along
with
a
rather
weak
nose
dropped
the
score
somewhat
otherwise
i
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
cheers
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
paired
with
food
has
some
hefe
qualities
to
it
this
would
be
an
ideal
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
until
the
surprise
of
7
6
abv
arrives
of
course
its
drinkable
ha
overall
im
a
fan
the
well
made
belgian
style
trippels
are
always
so
deceiving
to
me
i
mean
living
in
america
i
look
at
the
coloring
and
think
oh
great
another
light
bodied
no
taste
lager
which
is
seriously
so
far
from
the
truth
i
dont
even
know
how
to
quantify
the
difference
in
quality
there
bottom
line
i
recommend
for
sure
north
coast
has
continued
to
impress
me
and
has
yet
to
let
me
down
this
is
decent
but
the
big
clove
character
is
not
my
favorite
if
thats
your
thing
you
may
like
this
more
than
me
the
mouthfeel
detracts
a
bit
from
it
as
well
a
decent
beer
which
i
probably
wouldnt
turn
down
but
not
something
id
go
back
to
very
often
either
this
is
a
first
rate
nonbelgian
belgian
this
is
consistent
with
my
view
of
world
beers
there
are
lots
of
great
ones
out
there
but
some
of
the
best
ones
out
there
are
from
here
but
here
the
us
is
a
big
place
too
ca
is
really
half
a
world
away
but
this
beauty
travels
well
and
deserves
a
taste
buy
some
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
it
would
make
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
springsummer
nights
flavorful
to
be
sure
but
not
in
the
class
of
duvel
but
then
again
how
many
beers
are
side
notes
rather
good
with
thin
crust
pizza
750
bottle
conditioned
with
plenty
of
lees
still
in
the
bottle
poured
into
tulip
great
golden
color
with
moderate
head
not
as
pronounced
head
or
carbonation
as
other
bottleconditioned
belgians
ive
tried
recently
nice
yeasty
taste
fairly
light
on
the
cakeymalt
flavor
but
incredibly
drinkable
great
anytime
likely
even
better
in
summer
d
again
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
needs
something
to
carry
the
flavors
all
the
way
through
the
drinking
experience
if
you
ask
me
it
is
missing
something
d
this
would
go
down
very
easy
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
apricot
smelltaste
is
very
appelaing
to
me
taste
very
similar
to
aroma
there
is
an
almost
unnoticeable
hop
presence
drinks
very
smoothly
mouthfeel
of
low
carbonation
but
carbonation
is
very
clearly
there
as
seen
in
the
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
slightly
light
on
the
body
strong
caramelized
sugar
presence
some
butterscotch
belgian
doughypeppery
yeast
flavors
mostly
with
pale
belgian
malt
this
beer
is
good
it
is
just
not
as
good
as
other
examples
i
have
had
as
there
is
less
complexity
going
on
here
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
good
though
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
although
for
me
it
would
highly
depend
on
the
occasion
drinks
very
smooth
with
a
sweet
yet
not
overpowering
taste
for
about
9
a
4pack
this
is
an
absolute
steal
probably
one
of
my
favorite
north
coast
beers
so
far
up
there
with
old
rasputin
dm
very
good
beer
for
sipping
on
time
and
time
again
great
summer
beer
d
decent
example
of
the
style
but
there
are
better
versions
out
there
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
but
nowhere
near
duvel
which
is
the
standard
as
far
as
bsps
go
imo
truly
i
feel
like
the
brewer
overshot
subtlety
and
landed
somewhere
south
of
flat
its
just
not
that
interesting
considering
the
competition
sorta
reminded
me
a
of
kwak
in
that
respect
not
a
bad
example
at
all
but
no
way
is
it
getting
anything
above
a
b
for
me
anyway
a
hazy
golden
brew
with
a
fine
white
froth
and
lace
lemony
pale
malt
aroma
with
unmistakable
belgian
funk
begins
with
bright
flavors
of
pale
grain
orange
rind
flowers
belgian
yeast
adds
musty
funk
and
light
tartness
spicy
spritzy
and
light
on
the
palate
clean
finish
with
a
nice
grainy
aftertaste
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
and
as
with
all
north
coast
beers
a
good
deal
golden
in
the
glass
with
orange
highlights
a
gentle
pour
produces
only
a
small
head
which
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
the
nose
is
bready
and
estery
with
hints
of
pepper
and
bubblegum
similar
on
the
palate
sweet
pale
malts
meet
bubblegum
pepper
fresh
herbs
and
dried
fruit
banana
pear
its
complex
but
the
sweetness
and
phenols
are
too
much
for
me
and
theres
not
enough
carbonation
to
cleanse
the
palate
between
sips
not
terribly
impressive
stuff
its
got
a
bit
of
bite
to
it
but
definitely
cloves
and
some
fruitiness
to
lighten
things
up
too
the
sweetness
is
what
lingers
on
the
palate
which
is
a
good
thing
good
belgian
flavor
overall
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
golden
color
fizzy
with
around
an
inch
of
head
that
quickly
subsides
the
smell
centers
around
apple
juice
with
a
few
other
fruits
possibly
white
grapes
pears
and
peaches
tastes
like
a
creamy
white
grape
juice
very
clean
without
much
alcohol

theres
a
light
sugary
sweetness
and
some

through
in

to
the
fresh

from
the
yeast
moderate
body
with
good
carbonation
very
nice
drinkability
on
a
hard
to
nail
style
especially
outside
of
the
better
belgian
breweries
d
overall
a
very
tasty
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
ale
would
definitely
drink
again
smooth
and
pleasant
d
this
one
is
good
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
true
to
style
despite
the
alcohol
warmth
this
brew
is
pretty
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
change
from
some
of
the
regular
items
i
pick
up
alcohol
warmth
is
also
a
nice
surprise
when
cracking
this
open
on
a
cold
day
d
this
is
the
third
event
ive
picked
one
of
these
up
they
are
extremely
drinkable
and
if
you
dont
pace
yourself
youll
get
a
sneaky
alcohol
sucker
punch
when
you
get
off
the
bar
stool
thanks
bevmoian
for
the
opportunity
value
amazing
i
paid
2
for
a
bottle
i
think
the
four
pack
was
like
7
50
thats
a
steal
for
a
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
as
good
as
chimay
blonde
probably
better
overall
a
very
good
shot
but
doesnt
quite
compete
with
the
icons
of
the
style
good
drinking
belgian
pretty
nicely
done
version
of
the
style
by
a
us
brewer
d
this
is
one
of
those
catchall
styles
that
i
find
i
either
really
enjoy
or
feel
quite
the
opposite
about
this
was
sort
of
in
the
middle
surprisingly
the
alcohol
content
is
moderate
and
doesnt
provide
any
heat
and
the
flavors
are
nothing
too
adventurous
this
beer
resembles
strong
belgian
golden
ales
as
they
say
on
the
label
i
would
say
the
recepie
is
modeled
after
duvel
comparing
it
to
duvel
i
found
duvel
has
more
complexity
and
pleasantness
of
flavors
another
pretty
good
brew
from
north
coast

i
had
heard
some
good
things
about
this
brew
but
i
was
not
that
impressed
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
the
head
is
composed
of
large
bubbles
and
it
quickly
fades
leaving
no
lacing
smell
possesses
a
large
clove
note
along
with
some
lemon
and
apple
though
a
bit
reserved
and
the
clove
note
is
way
out
of
balance
with
the
others
taste
is
good
but
mainly
because
i
like
clovey
beers
same
notes
as
the
nose
but
still
out
of
balance
yeasty
too
mf
is
a
bit
prickly
overcarbonated
imo
dryish
decent
drink
not
a
bad
brew
but
id
rather
have
an
old
rasputin
i
made
the
mistake
of
trying
this
beer
right
after
i
had
a
duvel
sorry
for
the
crital
judgement
but
i
feel
that
this
also
helped
me
judge
it
better
when
comparing
it
to
a
world
class
beer
i
enjoyed
the
mild
clove
but
it
seemed
a
little
too
malty
for
my
likings
of
the
style
though
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
have
found
yet
again
that
a
belgian
strongpale
is
an
overall
winner
i
look
forward
to
more
beers
from
north
coast
i
was
excited
about
this
brew
based
on
all
the
positive
reviews
but
i
see
very
little
in
this
beer
more
a
witte
than
a
belgian
pale
does
not
compare
to
duvel
i
dont
know
what
people
are
talking
about
d
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
i
would
have
liked
to
have
it
a
little
fresher
as
my
bottle
to
review
was
a
little
older
a
nice
beer
by
north
coast
d
a
respectable
belgian
pale
imitation
decent
fruit
flavors
and
what
not
ive
heard
this
compared
to
duvel
cant
say
i
agree
as
i
find
duvel
to
be
top
pinnacle
of
the
style
with
more
complexity
and
pleasantness
of
flavors
thanks
but
no
thanks
ill
stick
with
duvel
the
north
coast
brewing
co
pranqster
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
in
the
glass
with
a
creamy
white
froth
above
average
lacing
above
average
retention
soft
pretty
aromas
of
lemon
subtle
orange
light
banana
esters
a
touch
of
honey
a
fresh
bread
yeastiness
almost
biscuit
like
pear
gala
apple
hints
of
passion
fruit
mango
wild

definitely
stargazer
lilly
follow
through
as
mouth
watering
flavors
on
the
palate
although
the
nose
seems
a
bit
straight
forward
its
elegant
complex
pretty
i
just
simple
couldnt
put
the
glass
down
because
i
kept
finding
more
subtle
characteristics
on
the
palate
the
beer
has
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
great
acidity
long
finish
a
slight
drying
sensation
not
talking
about
tannins
a
noticeableslightly
unbalanced
alcohol
presence
that
in
all
honesty
isnt
necessarily
unwelcome
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
was
absolutely
fantastic
one
that
i
highly
recommend
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
drinkable
anytime
day
or
night
in
the
tropics
or
the
tundra
drinkability
is
very
good
very
nice
flavorful
belgian
pale
that
isnt
too
heavy
or
overpowering
i
think
ill
have
another
lovely
beer
and
once
again
north
coast
has
impressed
me
with
their
great
brews
d
ive
changed
the
drinkability
rating
twice
while
reviewing
this
brew
it
grew
on
me
and
eventually
i
found
that
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
think
after
two
however
id
want
to
grab
something
else
the
flavors
are
not
as
refined
as
they
could
be
which
could
be
grating
to
the
palate
not
quite
in
the
same
league
as
the
venerable
duvel
but
close
not
the
best
looking
beer
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
with
ease
i
love
this
brewery
and
only
hope
more
of
their
products
become
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thin
head
which
disappeared
immediately
smell
is
lemon
malt
and
yeast
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
the
malt
being
more
dominant
than
i
would
have
guessed
from
the
aroma
the
yeast
and
lemon
are
also
present
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
decent
drinkable
beer
not
my
fav
beer
but
a
fun
alternative
to
the
ol
ipa
o
very
good
beer
and
a
very
tasty
belgian
for
pure
flavor
and
drinkability
i
find
this
to
be
far
superior
to
duvel
but
it
loses
points
for
a
weak
scent
and
lackluster
appearance
d
pranqster
is
a
very
nice
us
example
of
this
style
it
goes
down
quickly
perhaps
too
much
so
given
the
strength
ive
been
staring
at
this
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
and
am
glad
i
finally
decided
to
pick
it
up
drinkability
very
tasty
and
drinkable
throughout
the
whole
bottle
getting
better
as
it
warms
at
7
6
abv
you
could
almost
call
it
a
session
beer
i
would
probably
limit
myself
at
two
anyway
this
beer
wins
d
very
easy
to
drink
clean
finish
d
a
quality
american
made
belgian
style
ale
easily
drinkable
but
beware
of
alcohol
content
which
quickly
catches
up
with
you
d
a
nice
brew
from
north
coast
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
more
than
a
couple
my
first
beer
review
my
homebrew
beer
bro
brought
this
one
over
i
love
the
smell
its
intoxicating
it
leaves
a
pleasant
after
taste
what
more
can
i
say
its
just
my
first
review
but
there
seems
to
be
a
minimum
of
250
characters
so
ill
just
end
this
with
a
bunch
of
filler
i
must
say
that
i
like
the
name
of
the
brew
and
the
label
but
im
not
sure
about
the
use
of
the
q
funny
misspellings
are
too
common
these
days
i
think
its
more
hip
to
spell
things
normally
but
then
again
i
live
in
silicon
valley
where
spaces
between
words
are
deprecated
random
capitalization
is
par
for
the
course
and
qs
abound
d
highly
sessionable
d
spot
on
carbonation
and
hidden
abv
lends
itself
to
drinking
a
few
of
these
great
complex
palate
with
nothing
too
extreme
or
outlandish
to
limit
the
drinkability
here
drinkability
55
really
of
a
golden
than
a
strong
pale
as
the
brewers
themselves
would
indicate
the
pranqster
is
a
very
good
beer
thats
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
abv
great
golden
color
with
good
belgian
carbonation
very
good
lacing
aroma
is
a
little
sweeter
than
a
pale
again
like
a
blonde
or
a
golden
and
the
flavor
is
very
good
not
as
bubbly
as
it
could
be
this
is
a
fun
beer
from
a
good
brewery
d
umm
well
overall
not
good
every
drink
i
wish
was
my
last
planning
on
cellaring
the
last
three
and
tricking
people
into
drinking
them
hehehehe
because
i
am
a
pranqster
see
what
i
did
there
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
got
too
sweet
for
me
too
quickly
the
taste
is
all
banana
and
too
overwhelming
with
that
to
get
much
of
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
heavy
drinkability
is
just
not
there
pranqster
is
a
mastefully
brewed
beer
from
a
wonderful
brewery
this
particular
beer
is
a
slice
of
late
summer
day
sliding
into
autumn
with
afternoon
sunshine
warming
a
stone
wall
bordering
an
apple
orchard
pranqster
makes
me
wax
poetical
im
just
learning
my
belgian
ales
ive
tried
duvel
affligem
leffe
but
generally
prefer
this
one
even
though
its
american
btw
north
coasts
rasputin
imperial
stout
is
terrific
also
reminds
me
of
some
of
ommegangs
stuff
which
i
love
the
sharpness
with
the
sweet
thats
not
that
helpful
is
it
well
sometimes
i
feel
leffe
needs
that
little
bite
that
isnt
there
so
pranq
is
working
for
me
at
7
6
you
really
dont
sense
the
booze
my
only
beef
i
dont
like
the
graphic
design
on
the
label
superficial
i
know
d
i
wouldnt
think
hmm
duvel
compare
to
duvel
other
than
its
designation
as
a
bsga
im
more
prone
to
call
to
mind
certain
unibroue
offerings
first
to
me
more
like
la
fin
du
monde
than
duvel
north
coast
does
stellar
work
and
considering
the
breadth
of
their
brewing
opus
id
say
theyve
done
a
knockout
belgian
style
here
id
have
this
again
but
probably
not
until
after
ive
sampled
some
more
offerings
in
this
vein
although
as
i
continue
to
work
through
my
glass
its
very
warming
on
a
cold
rainy
night
and
its
highly
addictive
im
dreaming
of
food
pairings
good
cheeses
irish
cheddar
is
what
ive
got
on
hand
lemony
shellfish
pasta
salad
certain
nonchocolate
desserts
lighterprepared
duck
wildfowl
maybe
even
thanksgiving
dinner
if
i
were
pressed
for
a
brew
drinkability
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
style
and
well
before
i
finish
it
im
wishing
i
had
chilled
a
second
one
ill
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
pours
a
nice
light
golden
yellow
with
minimal
white
head
the
smell
is
some
citrus
mild
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
horse
blanket
smells
like
a
nice
dry
white
wine
taste
is
delicious
some
more
citrus
a
good
bready
flavor
from
the
yeast
a
good
amount
of
apricots
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
nice
drying
sweetness
to
it
a
nice
biting
effervescence
very
bubbly
and
airy
slightly
creamy
drinkability
is
good
definitely
up
there
for
a
bspa
the
mouthfeel
is
a
mediumfull
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
top
notch
offering
from
north
coast
the
price
for
a
4
pack
is
good
and
a
great
substitute
for
some
of
the
more
expensive
belgian
offerings
pretty
solid
atmosphere
appearance
is
solid
nose
is
really
complex
with
a
great
mix
of
components
very
pleasing
flavor
has
some
complexity
but
the
heavy
pungency
of
the
malt
distracts
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
d
its
smooth
bu8t
the
sourness
would
stop
me
at
about
three
in
a
sitting
d
drinks
easy
and
the
abv
isnt
too
overboard
d
moderate
great
taste
and
clean
finish
another
top
notch
offering
from
north
coast
d
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
no
carbonation
to
get
in
the
way
either
and
its
pretty
light
on
the
palate
i
think
its
very
very
nice
cheers
appears
dark
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
head
after
a
hard
pour
i
can
smell
alittle
citrus
and
funk
taste
is
spicey
with
little
to
no
hops
lots
of
malt
flavor
yet
again
i
am
geting
a
skunked
flavor
posibly
an
old
bottle
and
cant
find
any
bottle
by
on
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
to
much
carbonation
with
makes
my
throat
burn
on
the
way
down
i
dont
like
anything
about
this
beer
not
reccomended
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
sure
i
would
choose
it
over
other
similar
options
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
d
incredibly
drinkable
due
to
its
lighter
body
and
little
carbonation
the
high
abv
comes
through
a
little
but
thats
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
d
3
0
a
bit
thinner
in
body
than
i
would
expect
compared
to
other
bspas
o
reasonably
good
us
made
belgian
beer
there
were
some
small
almost
indescribable
qualities
i
felt
were
missing
but
this
is
a
great
beer
ive
had
plenty
of
belgianstyle
beers
that
were
not
quite
there
this
one
was
spot
on
and
a
unique
aroma
plus
a
great
drinkability
leaves
a
pretty
solid
offering
that
can
stand
on
its
own
best
belgium
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
and
reminds
me
of
how
much
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
beer
over
in
belgium
overall
a
very
nice
bspa
glad
i
have
3
more
i
know
the
alcohol
is
up
there
in
pranqster
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
faded
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
over
ripe
sweet
fruit
the
taste
was
also
fruity
banana
among
others
and
sweet
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
for
a
bspa
drinkability
was
good
my
favorite
bspa
to
date
d
when
combined
with
the
aroma
this
went
down
way
too
easy
very
sessionable
at
least
until
the
alcohol
gets
to
you
d
very
enjoyable
and
not
as
alcoholic
as
some
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
id
definitely
have
it
again
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
without
a
double
even
if
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
though
the
alcohol
hits
fast
i
can
see
myself
having
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
something
about
it
yeast
gives
it
a
very
unique
smell
and
taste
poured
into
chimay
chalice
looks
almost
exactly
like
chimay
white
its
a
nice
opaque
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
all
but
vanishes
almost
no
lacing
smells
like
belgian
yeast
with
some
citrus
spice
and
floral
notes
dominant
taste
is
definitely
corriander
spice
with
the
yeast
and
a
bready
quality
little
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
and
nice
sweetness
on
finish
does
gain
more
character
as
it
warms
and
opens
up
a
bit
for
a
belgian
pale
its
a
pretty
good
one
its
about
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
smoothly
carbonation
just
right
these
are
sold
in
four
packs
and
thats
about
how
many
i
would
drink
nice
north
coast
pranqster
is
a
cloudy
golden
ale
with
some
particles
in
it
it
has
a
thin
off
white
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
citrusy
aroma
it
has
a
note
of
lemon
and
something
funky
and
leathery
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
new
car
it
has
a
very
bubbly
medium
body
with
a
chewy
finish
it
tastes
like
leather
and
lemon
with
a
botanical
bitterness
with
notes
of
juniper
and
phenol
it
has
good
balance
and
it
tastes
very
belgian
md
easy
enough
drinker
if
its
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
but
there
are
better
in
style
smells
like
apples
tastes
like
hops
low
head
retention
and
mild
lacing
i
had
the
luxury
of
trying
this
last
night
and
ended
up
ordering
two
more
very
tasty
the
fragrance
certainly
did
not
match
the
taste
which
is
a
good
thing
the
appleapricot
scent
is
strong
but
would
be
overpowering
to
the
tongue
the
muted
apple
notes
balanced
well
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
mouthfeel
is
rich
smooth
and
silky
soft
carbonation
i
wasnt
big
on
this
beer
until
the
temperature
came
up
a
bit
at
the
proper
temperature
i
am
really
loving
it
tasting
notes
from
06
aug
2009
d
at
first
taste
you
would
think
this
is
gonna
be
hard
to
throw
back
but
after
a
you
get
your
mouth
wet
she
slides
right
down
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
on
the
weekend
this
is
a
case
purchaser
poured
into
a
snifterthis
beer
is
an
orangegold
hue
with
a
nice
head
not
much
lacing
nose
is
yeasty
and
a
tad
sour
taste
is
slightly
spiced
with
some
coriander
with
light
fruity
esters
and
banana
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonatedvery
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
taste
is
fizzy
and
oily
lots
of
yeast
some
sour
malt
some
fruit
a
little
musty
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
nuts
leaves
the
mouth
on
the
dry
side
has
a
yelloworange
cider
look
head
pretty
much
dispersed
after
opening
smells
a
little
bit
like
apples
taste
has
a
mix
of
floral
hops
and
some
fruits
possibly
apple
in
flavor
not
a
personal
fan
of
the
mix
but
its
pretty
distinctstrong
good
amount
of
thickness
to
it
also
good
beer
but
not
for
my
personal
taste
d
simple
but
tasty
incredibly
full
mouthfeel
on
this
one
and
a
surprisingly
good
drinker
the
abv
isnt
anywhere
near
strong
enough
to
be
dangerous
but
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
just
so
up
there
that
an
entire
pint
will
be
gone
before
you
even
knew
where
it
went
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
offering
from
ncb
behind
le
merle
i
waffled
back
and
forth
about
what
i
thought
about
this
beer
first
i
thought
it
was
not
good
then
good
then
notsogood
again
no
head
at
all
after
a
loud
popping
fizzy
head
disappeared
very
quickly
depending
on
the
light
backing
it
the
beer
went
from
orange
to
bronze
to
yellow
sweet
fruits
and
honey
dominate
the
smell
yeasty
strangeness
attacks
the
tongue
with
a
fresh
fruitiness
that
doesnt
offend
or
please
the
mouthfeel
is
so
weird
bittingly
crisp
leaves
the
tongue
numb
and
tingly
finishes
very
dry
its
abv
is
fairly
noticeable
it
is
just
a
strange
beer
with
a
strange
spelling
you
may
think
its
great
or
not
great
or
like
me
not
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
drinkability
while
the
alcohol
content
holds
this
down
a
hair
i
think
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
d
an
enjoyable
belgian
that
isnt
overpowering
simple
and
straightforward
but
definitely
solid
served
at
the
austin
ginger
man
a
gorgeous
hazy
mix
of
orange
and
red
with
little
head
to
speak
of
smell
and
taste
both
full
of
clove
orange
cherry
and
yeast
flavors
served
up
with
a
pretty
creamy
body
no
sense
whatsoever
of
the
7
6
id
have
to
try
it
again
before
id
call
it
complex
but
pranqster
is
definitely
wellcrafted
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
fairly
decent
for
its
abv
i
could
put
a
few
down
this
is
not
a
superpotent
beer
in
terms
of
abv
but
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
punch
comes
through
in
the
glass
its
very
refreshing
but
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
dangerous
not
so
much
as
its
cousin
delirium
tremens
but
still
a
heady
brew
interesting
and
enjoyable
are
adjectives
that
come
to
mind
here
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
unlike
the
other
belgian
strong
ale
i
was
not
expecting
the
smoky
flavor
i
could
be
wrong
and
have
it
mixed
up
with
something
else
but
none
the
less
another
good
beer
from
north
coast
d
pretty
good
wouldnt
have
more
than
the
one
because
of
the
abv
but
i
can
imagine
enjoying
a
second
the
flavors
are
nice
will
probably
buy
again
notes
the
second
north
coast
brewing
company
beer
that
i
have
had
the
other
rasputin
was
a
classic
this
inspires
me
to
continue
to
seek
out
their
beers
drinkability
really
high
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
while
still
having
a
really
full
flavorful
taste
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
solid
beer
and
at
just
under
eight
dollars
for
four
pack
it
was
a
relatively
fair
price
i
need
to
explore
more
in
this
style
but
so
far
i
really
enjoy
the
slashing
tastes
in
these
beers
north
coast
has
done
a
nice
job
here
los
natas
and
fleetwood
mac
i
wish
theyd
have
disguised
the
alcohol
better
to
be
honest
the
abv
is
not
such
that
this
needs
to
be
so
boozy
the
qualities
otherwise
are
very
good
but
this
simple
fact
decreases
taste
and
drinkability
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
north
coast
offering
but
not
one
i
am
unhappy
with
either
dthe
musty
and
yeasty
tastes
may
have
lead
to
my
average
review
maybe
a
bad
bottle
willing
to
try
again
off
tap
at
neci
in
essex
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
banana
yellow
color
showing
their
expertise
the
brew
was
poured
perfectly
with
two
fingers
of
puffy
beige
head
like
a
dome
atop
the
fluid
the
aroma
was
semisweet
and
very
appealing
with
notes
of
belgian
yeast
floral
hops
orange
light
toffee
sweet
malt
and
light
tropical
fruit
the
flavors
were
complex
and
onpoint
for
the
style
i
tasted
yeast
tropical
fruit
wheat
candy
sugar
light
toffee
tart
and
citric
hop
built
on
a
doughy
malt
backbone
for
as
big
as
it
was
the
alcohol
was
wellconcealed
but
became
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
wellbalanced
and
crisp
for
as
big
and
layered
as
it
was
it
was
also
dangerously
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
perfect
it
was
a
treat
to
find
it
ontap
and
its
one
id
recommend
poured
hazy
orangegold
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
little
lacing
lemon
peel
apricot
and
sweet
yeast
esters
in
the
nose
grassy
and
light
soft
mouthfeel
with
carbonation
dry
finish
refeshing
spice
and
citrus
taste
lemon
and
lemongrass
balanced
by
the
sweeter
bananabubblegum
flavors
some
hoppystraw
tanginess
from
time
to
time
got
to
say
that
the
7
abv
was
completely
masked
wouldnt
have
known
unless
it
was
on
the
bottle
well
done
i
must
say
that
this
brew
was
my
first
true
craft
beer
had
it
on
my
21st
bday
a
couple
years
ago
and
this
is
what
really
got
me
into
the
craft
beer
scene
sure
glad
i
tried
it
d
pretty
much
a
poor
mans
duvel
its
not
actively
bad
and
the
elements
of
a
good
belgian
are
present
but
it
never
gets
out
of
first
gear
the
first
real
disappointment
ive
had
from
north
coast
drinkability
i
love
this
stuff
gotta
let
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
though
i
think
it
rivals
most
any
belgian
strong
pale
when
price
is
factored
in
hell
yeah
north
coast
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
thinner
than
i
had
expected
but
mostly
a
satisfying
experience
overall
the
spices
are
very
well
balanced
with
the
fruit
and
the
flavors
really
come
together
quite
well
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
that
has
more
gold
along
the
edges
with
a
small
frothy
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
splotchy
layer
around
the
glass
the
aroma
has
fruity
esters
ginger
and
some
yeast
it
has
an
almost
medicinal
aroma
the
flavor
is
some
slight
orange
peel
sweet
toasted
malt
apricot
and
some
hints
of
hops
its
medium
bodied
and
just
a
touch
sticky
but
does
have
noticeable
carbonation
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
creative
and
extremely
thirst
quenching
notes
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
long
shot
but
a
very
well
crafted
ale
and
one
that
i
imagine
stands
up
very
nicely
to
the
belgian
exports
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
melon
and
clove
flavor
is
a
bit
sharp
and
spicy
upfront
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
lots
of
yeastybready
notes
a
decent
belgian
strong
ale
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
or
anything
d
disguises
the
abv
fairly
well
very
flavorful
glad
to
have
3
more
left
in
the
4pack
d
extremely
drinkable
goes
well
with
summer
a
great
beer
to
just
relax
and
kick
back
with
for
barbecues
though
it
has
a
nice
head
but
does
not
last
the
color
is
bad
not
much
on
the
smell
have
to
strain
the
nose
to
get
something
the
taste
is
positive
has
some
flavor
in
it
though
it
could
be
stronger
the
lack
of
strength
of
taste
makes
up
in
drinkability
feels
good
and
goes
down
smooth
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
not
bad
since
looks
and
smell
are
not
all
that
does
have
a
slight
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
delayed
o
i
actually
like
this
beer
i
didnt
rate
it
the
highest
because
i
thought
there
were
some
major
flaws
as
far
a
s
appearance
goes
and
the
nose
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
taste
however
is
excellent
ill
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
d
i
actually
kind
of
gulped
this
down
to
be
done
with
it
while
on
point
for
a
bspa
the
flavors
dont
mesh
well
and
the
feel
is
just
a
bit
thick
for
me
not
for
me
the
dryness
and
chemical
edge
was
enough
of
a
turn
off
to
make
this
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
mouthful
at
a
time
i
dug
it
but
not
as
a
first
choice
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
and
the
flavor
keeps
me
wanting
more
its
got
a
nice
fresh
feeling
to
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
wouldnt
kick
your
ass
after
a
few
good
carbonation
though
not
too
crazy
solid
drinkability
a
4pk
of
this
would
do
you
in
good
stead
on
a
nice
summer
evening
like
this
one
the
degree
of
the
alcoholic
burn
apparent
with
warming
is
quite
surprising
as
this
is
otherwise
a
tasty
wellcrafted
belgianstyle
golden
ale
and
though
the
alcohol
content
surpasses
seven
percent
such
alcohol
presence
is
startling
perhaps
another
go
with
a
different
bottle
would
yield
different
results
otherwise
a
nice
beer
that
fit
the
evenings
pining
for
a
belgian
beer
at
a
lower
cost
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
spring
night
nothing
earth
shattering
but
i
would
be
glad
to
have
this
again
i
worked
through
a
4pack
of
this
and
have
to
say
after
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
a
mighty
fine
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
in
my
tulip
glass
with
lots
of
foam
that
didnt
stick
to
the
glass
musty
and
yeasty
aroma
but
nice
yeasty
spicy
zip
in
the
flavor
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
malt
side
for
the
style
but
a
good
combination
a
little
tingly
on
the
tongue
which
is
a
good
thing
and
real
joy
to
drink
ill
have
another
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
was
left
somewhat
disappointing
this
cant
hold
a
candle
to
an
tremens
or
a
duvel
sorry
appearance
is
a
lightly
misty
golden
yellow
with
no
head
smell
has
that
traditional
belgian
yeasty
aroma
thats
spicy
fruity
and
lightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
alchohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fair
alchohol
presents
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
for
not
being
a
belgian
overall
a
good
beer
but
ill
take
celis

anyday
d
goes
down
easy
enough
but
like
i
said
one
is
enough
pours
a
golden
sunset
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
belgian
head
that
dissipates
nicely
and
leaves
a
nice
ring
with
lacing
til
finish
smell
is
of
coriander
and
clove
some
apples
and
pear
and
some
cinnamon
the
taste
is
outstanding
forget
the
imports
buy
this
one
it
starts
with
fruit
and
clove
then
some
yeast
and
malts
cotes
the
palate
its
perfectly
balanced
it
just
rolls
in
the
mouth
and
cotes
your
taste
buds
and
is
oh
so
drinkable
but
at
7
6
it
will
hit
you
its
well
hidden
i
find
this
pale
ale
as
good
as
the
imports
and
highly
recommend
it
i
will
say
if
you
like
this
ale
try

overall

super
drinkable

very
easy
to
enjoy
this
brew
will
find
a
happy
little
spot
in
my
fridge
drinkability
i
am
loving
this
beer
its
very
tasty
and
the
finish
is
light
and
clean
flavors
are
strong
and
very
pronounced
and
makes
for
a
great
drinking
experience
and
while
the
abv
is
getting
a
little
high
i
feel
i
could
get
through
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
pours
a
very
nice
head
and
has
a
great
very
golden
appearance
to
it
the
color
is
outstanding
has
a
very
good
feeling
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
nice
abv
too
doesnt
hurt
the
smell
is
by
no
means
bad
but
is
maybe
less
apparent
than
one
might
like
still
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
really
good
interpretation
of
a
belgian
i
would
get
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
excellent
creation
d
surely
holds
it
own
for
the
style
can
proudly
put
this
alongside
from
the
european
counterparts
would
i
choose
it
over
duvel
i
might
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
for
the
price
awesome
alcohol
not
noticeable
for
a
7
6
beer
mouthfeel
suffers
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
conclusion
i
was
honestly
a
bit
let
down
by
this
its
potent
its
big
its
just
a
bit
simplistic
and
overly
hot
in
the
alcohol
for
me
notes
typical
belgianstyle
nothing
very
unique
here
true
to
the
style
and
will
done
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
have
tossed
back
a
4
pack
on
quite
a
few
nights
the
price
point
really
makes
this
beer
even
more
of
a
contender
d
another
solid
beer
from
north
coast
skip
this
one
as
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
brewed
domestically
or
via
import
the
price
is
right
at
7
but
i
was
let
down
im
in
no
hurry
to
revisit
this
one
hopefully
there
was
just
something
off
with
my
bottle
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
might
try
it
again
overall
a
very
deft
attempt
at
this
style
by
a
very
strong
brewery
just
so
happens
that
duvel
sets
the
standard
for
me
and
it
is
hard
to
live
up
to
but
that
doesnt
mean
this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
which
it
is
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
stong
the
abv
is
d
one
was
enough
not
the
most
interesting
beer
of
its
style
but
the
blowout
price
is
enough
to
make
me
go
pick
up
a
few
more
and
drink
one
every
so
often
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
this
was
a
very
solid
belgian
beer
i
enjoyed
the
complex
flavors
of
fruitiness
and
spice
this
beer
poured
nice
and
had
a
average
head
that
dissipated
quickly
very
drinkable
and
great
aroma
a
pleasure
to
drink
of
all
the
bengian
beers
i
have
tried
i
would
rank
this
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
refreshing
complex
tasty
and
never
overpowering
drinkable
definitely
this
is
actually
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
its
fantastic
i
picked
this
particular
one
because
i
was
going
to
make
a
chicken
recipe
from
the
last
issue
of
the
ba
mag
that
called
for
it
thanks
guys
although
i
havent
made
the
recipe
yet
hopefully
the
beer
with
make
it
that
long
dok
drinkability
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
one
again
but
i
enjoyed
it
this
time
overall
i
am
glad
i
discovered
this
beer
highly
drinkable
even
at
7
6
abv
and
left
me
wanting
more
i
think
that
pitching
the
yeast
is
essential
for
this
brew
and
would
make
sure
to
do
that
again
when
drinking
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
white
head
nice
continuous
head
formationretention
smells
of
yeast
tangerines
apricots
and
orange
rind
hint
of
lemongrass
and
spice
flavor
is
an
excellent
spicy
mildly
yeasty
bland
of
orange
zest
belgian
malt
vague
sweetness
apricot
and
coriander
alcohol
very
prominent
but
appropriately
so
for
the
style
and
flavor
medium
to
full
bodied
sticky
creamy
mouthfeel
an
eminently
drinkable
bspa
smooth
and
clean
impressive
that
north
coast
can
brew
such
a
range
of
really
excellent
and
truetostyle
beers
d
more
drinkable
than
duvel
for
me
though
duvel
may
be
a
bit
bigger
and
badder
ill
still
look
out
for
pranqster
in
the
summer
and
spring
months
despite
the
abv
this
one
still
goes
down
quite
nicely
glad
i
cracked
this
open
tonight
d
good
drinkablity
i
could
have
another
of
these
would
like
to
have
it
from
the
tap
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
surface
nice
aroma
of
cloves
and
fruit
such
as
bananas
and
grapes
the
flavor
is
likewise
a
combination
of
the
spice
and
fruit
flavors
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
i
prefer
this
style
a
little
drier
the
body
seems
a
little
weak
and
thin
lacks
a
good
texture
and
feels
a
little
harsh
a
nice
beer
and
true
to
style
a
very
good
value
as
well
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
drinks
good
easy
d
i
enjoyed
this
like
a
beer
and
wine
combo
good
alcohol
balance
with
good
carbonation
level
maybe
the
true
champagne
of
beers
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
extremely
crisp
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
only
provides
a
great
and
welcoming
warmth
doesnt
interfere
with
flavors
at
all
carbonation
is
very
belgian
and
spot
on
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
think
this
was
fresh
out
of
belgium
as
a
matter
of
fact
great
brew
north
coast
is
truly
an
amazing
brewery
pours
a
hazy
gold
head
is
large
but
quickly
recedes
into
a
sheet
of
cover
nose
is
all
belgian
spiciness
light
citrusorange
fruit
and
a
soft
candytoffee
mediumdry
on
the
tongue
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
alcohol
comes
through
along
with
some
orange
and
some
earthy
and
chalky
flavours
typical
belgian
spiciness
not
overly
fruity
really
not
a
lot
of
huge
flavours
in
this
but
a
nice
balance
overall
pretty
drinkable
golden
ale
poured
hazy
gold
color
lots
of
carbonation
with
this
one
which
i
like
can
taste
the
spice
in
this
one
not
sure
what
it
is
but
tastes
kinda
fruity
has
a
really
nice
malty
feel
and
taste
and
is
just
sweet
enough
lot
going
on
with
this
one
i
will
have
to
give
it
another
shot
overall
this
was
an
amazing
beer
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
definitely
have
another
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
with
moderate
head
and
lacing
passion
fruit
up
front
not
too
much
citrus
or
coriander
with
minimal
alcohol
bite
on
the
back
dangerously
drinkable
very
similar
to
allagashtripel
a
fine
interpretation
of
the
american
version
of
the
style
d
this
beer
is
complex
there
are
flavors
i
werent
able
to
pin
down
but
i
loved
every
second
of
it
d
not
alot
of
the
7
6
abv
is
present
at
all
i
could
see
revisiting
this
when
i
would
want
a
belgian
strong
while
im
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
pranqster
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
primarily
citrus
and
a
bit
spicy
too
the
flavor
strikes
me
as
having
more
spice
than
fruit
although
the
fruit
is
clearly
present
there
is
definitely
a
peppery
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
little
peculiar
for
the
style
but
overall
a
decent
brew
maybe
just
bad
bottle
but
not
one
i
will
buy
again
maybe
on
tap
it
is
better
wow
i
love
north
coast
but
i
didnt
expect
this
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
initial
head
retention
isnt
great
but
stays
creamy
aroma
is
thick
and
heavy
with
sweet
fruits
and
for
lack
of
better
words
belgium
i
cant
say
the
taste
is
otherworldly
like
the
similar
duvel
but
still
exceptional
it
really
has
that
belgian
character
unlike
most
american
belgianstyle
blonde
ales
ive
had
fruity
and
sweet
with
some
spice
refreshing
still
thick
and
creamy
i
with
there
was
a
great
head
on
it
as
that
would
really
make
each
really
silky
but
the
head
touching
your
lips
then
sipping
the
ale
from
under
it
and
getting
that
feeling
of
love
in
a
glass
ill
try
for
a
better
head
next
time
id
like
to
try
this
back
to
back
with
duvel
for
kicks
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
with
thin
head
the
smell
is
citrus
spicey
and
sweet
i
smelled
an
array
of
scents
such
as
clove
orange
cinnamon
and
wheat
i
was
impressed
with
the
complex
aroma
taste
was
a
let
down
from
the
smell
it
tasted
of
orange
and
spice
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
present
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
i
would
drink
this
again
because
i
feel
it
needs
another
chance
but
as
of
now
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
doesnt
really
jump
off
the
charts
in
terms
of
the
wow
factor
but
definitely
well
constructed
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
one
you
could
have
a
few
of
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
fullon
cloudiness
with
a
warm
yelloworange
glow
slight
white
foam
across
the
surface
of
microbubbles
which
disperse
swift
enough
if
replenished
by
streams
of
bubbles
from
below
clove
cumin
coriander
and
orange
spice
frame
the
nose
justcooked
bread
and
fresh
yeasts
poached
pear
and
forest
floor
underbrush
fullbodied
with
frothy
carbonation
which
clings
to
your
mouth
pores
like
scrubbing
bubbles
all
that
clove
ginger
coriander
spice
alive
here
with
deeper
accentuation
to
the
orange
lemon
citrus
texturally
has
a
semicreamy
feel
like
buttered
dough
or
warm
wax
pear
banana
and
some
apricot
fruit
add
depth
while
it
rolls
across
your
tongue
hits
the
brakes
rather
than
extend
at
the
end
maybe
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
as
the
half
a
dozen
belgian
style
beers
ive
had
recently
have
just
tasted
like
biting
into
mellow
spicy
dirt
and
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
really
put
me
off
ive
had
other
belgians
that
were
to
my
liking
that
had
more
varied
flavors
and
reminded
me
more
of
autumn
colorssmells
than
of
chomping
on
a
wooden
table
ill
continue
to
try
belgians
and
perhaps
i
will
rereview
this
beer
in
the
future
but
for
now
i
encourage
anyone
who
does
not
absolutely
adore
belgians
to
go
elsewhere
when
exploring
this
style
enjoyable
beer
poured
golden
with
an
active
2
finger
head
aroma
hints
of
cereal
cinnamon
clove
and
candy
flavor
was
tart
and
woody
with
a
oddly
pleasant
metallic
overtone
and
a
warm
sting
following
it
went
down
a
little
quick
and
i
felt
the
abv
bravo
hazy
orange
gold
with
a
tight
thin
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
of
citrus
fruit
lemons
and
oranges
with
a
good
amount
of
wheat
a
touch
of
pepper
and
just
a
faint
whiff
of
belgian
yeast
character
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
strong
spice
character
reminiscent
of
a
white
ale
with
more
malt
focus
and
definitely
some
wheat
flavor
the
finish
is
a
touch
bitter
but
that
is
the
only
place
where
the
hops
come
through
peppery
dry
as
well
after
the
bitterness
moves
through
mouthfeel
is
lively
peppery
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
very
pleasant
wow
this
is
a
really
good
easy
drinking
well
rounded
beer
its
fairly
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
tending
more
towards
the
sweetfruity
end
of
the
spectrum
but
it
is
still
so
very
well
crafted
that
it
is
a
joy
a
sessionable
strong
belgian
ale
yeah
i
think
so
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
very
great
interpretation
worth
comparing
to
duvel
d
exceptional
could
drink
this
all
day
attractive
goldenorange
color
almost
nonexistant
head
aromas
of
orange
apricot
yeast
cinnamon
and
some
restrained
bazooka
bubblegum
prevail
palate
seemed
flat
to
me
for
this
style
needed
much
more
spritz
a
rich
fruity
sweetness
dominates
the
flavor
profile
supported
by
some
background
clove
citrus
and
peach
worth
a
visit
but
not
one
of
this
brewers
best
offers
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
the
7
6
is
well
hidden
different
than
expected
but
good
drinkability
this
one
has
a
decent
return
factor
not
my
thing
but
anyone
into
this
particular
style
will
dig
it
overall
a
drinkable
beer
watch
out
for
the
7
6
percent
abv
which
doesnt
seem
like
a
lot
but
will
sneak
up
on
you
since
its
covered
up
so
well
poured
into
sturdy
chalice
poured
gently
so
that
there
was
less
than
1
finger
of
head
head
dissapated
quickly
leaving
a
nice
lace
a
beautiful
hazy
orangegold
color
great
spicy
aroma
fantastic
tasting
beer
with
a
well
balanced
spice
flavor
well
rounded
full
body
extremely
drinkable
on
the
strong
side
for
a
session
but
since
its
sold
in
4
packs
its
just
the
right
amount
for
sitting
next
to
the
river
in
summer
or
snuggled
warmly
with
a
book
on
a
cold
night
or
anytime
really
truly
a
classic
d
a
good
american
take
on
this
belgian
style
id
like
a
bit
more
complexity
but
this
is
a
good
anytime
drinker
drinkability
is
awesome
i
could
probaby
swig
back
some
more
of
these
md
carbonation
is
kinda
high
which
makes
it
hard
to
really
feel
the
beer
on
your
tongue
to
taste
it
well
but
it
doesnt
make
the
beer
undesirable
texture
is
heavier
than
it
looks
and
i
wouldnt
session
this
as
a
result
i
could
have
a
couple
though
drinkability
this
one
definitely
grows
on
you
i
read
todds
review
before
trying
it
and
didnt
think
id
like
it
a
whole
lot
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
has
a
rich
feel
to
it
edit
thought
the
spiciness
was
a
bit
much
but
this
gets
smoother
and
smoother
as
you
dirnk
it
d
this
practically
requires
you
to
have
more
than
one
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
enjoyably
all
the
way
through
d
pretty
strong
on
my
empty
tummy
but
i
think
i
can
drink
at
least
two
six
packs
hell
ol
d
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
the
night
and
enjoy
every
drop
really
a
good
drinking
experience
one
that
stands
up
to
almost
any
others
ive
had
from
the
style
taste
a
nice
malt
backbone
that
stands
up
to
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
there
is
a
fruitiness
with
notes
of
esters
and
citrus
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
is
very
balance
with
lots
of
flavors
and
aromas
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
to
be
enjoyed
i
was
quite
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
was
it
had
a
good
astringent
mouth
feel
with
a
smooth
crisp
clean
finish
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
definitely
some
wonderful
spice
notes
nice
and
bubbly
with
the
a
great
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
leffe
or
affligem
awesome
beer
drinkability
relatively
high
abv
but
tastes
good
and
most
of
the
flavors
mask
the
alcohol
taste
so
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
couple
a
nice
drinking
beer
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
has
a
nice
fruity
citrus
and
alcohol
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
citrus
orange
and
lemon
taste
to
it
very
quaffable
belgianstyle
ale
a
nice
strong
ale
yet
not
as
memorable
as
when
had
on
tap
which
offered
less
sweetness
and
a
richer
feel
12
oz

golden
pour
with
a
thick

aroma
of
peppery
hops
yeast
and

peppery
flavor
with
yeast
gingerbread
and
bananas
present
great
finish
one
of
those
rare
golden
ales
with
a
bite
almost
an
ipa
hybrid
d
not
all
bad
but
not
quite
up
to
snuff
for
bspa
i
might
have
felt
different
if
it
were
classified
as
a
belgian
blonde
a
pretty
cool
beer
with
some
interesting
things
going
on
i
would
agree
that
this
is
very
similar
to
a
tripel
and
an
enjoyable
one
at
that
thanks
to
shawn
for
a
chance
at
this
one
thanks
for
sharing
sstackho
overall
i
liked
it
not
my
favorite
but
its
worth
checking
out
north
coast
claims
to
using
a
mixed
culture
of
antique
yeast
and
this
indeed
does
have
the
substance
and
poise
of
a
true
time
tested
belgian
ale
i
wouldnt
consider
it
quite
as
good
as
authentic
but
beyond
doubt
this
is
miles
ahead
of
what
many
other
us
craft
brewers
have
been
capable
of
doing
with
the
style
medium
bodied
with
the
alcohol
tucked
in
well
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
ale
period
reasonably
priced
at
six
bucks
a
bomber
at
bevmo
try
it
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
cant
reccomd
it
at
7
6
abv
this
shit
aint
exactly
sessionable
but
i
would
certainly
try
to
take
down
a
few
given
the
opportunity
thrown
in
the
cellar
and
forgotten
until
now
appeared
yelloworange
with
dollops
of
sugarwhite
lacing
and
a
thin
head
smelled
of
sweet
and
sour
apples
flavors
of
tart
brandied
apples
and
some
melon
melded
to
a
peppery
and
somewhat
dry
finish
sugar
cane
shined
in
the
effervescence
just
a
little
boozy
in
the
middle
with
a
silky
smooth
feel
nice
this
is
a
nice
looking
beer
shimmering
rich
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
little
lacing
big
fruity
nose
with
a
touch
of
coriander
very
sweet
taste
with
a
strong
banana
and
alcohol
presence
as
this
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
loses
its
impact
nothing
awful
just
not
as
rich
as
it
could
be
a
well
made
belgian
easy
to
drink
and
savor
recommended
pours
hazy
golden
with
lively
carbonation
streamers
and
a
good
head
although
the
head
does
drop
quickly
and
shows
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
rather
flowery
the
flavor
is
strong
and
phenolic
with
characteristics
of
clove
and
allspice
there
is
a
trace
of
lemony
citrus
there
is
that
distinctive
mild
sourness
of
a
belgian
ale
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
perhaps
too
much
so
given
the
relatively
stiff
abv
there
is
a
bit
of
ethanol
heat
and
clove
spice
that
lingers
more
and
more
as
it
warms
not
as
overpowering
as
some
bspas
out
there
but
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
that
is
quite
pleasant
drinkability
is
good
for
this
level
of
alcohol
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
a
nice
pick
its
not
in
the
neighborhood
of
its
more
authentic
competitors
but
for
an
americanbrewed
strong
pale
this
one
a
good
choice
d
not
really
id
rather
drink
other
overpriced
beer
poured
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
moderately
carbonated
with
plenty
of
grit
floating
around
smell
is
somewhat
bready
spicy
and
belgian
i
might
be
crazy
but
i
detect
a
bit
of
smoke
going
on
an
earthy
bitterness
tastes
tart
spicy
and
yeasty
up
front
sweet
finish
great
mouthfeel
too
a
bit
fizzy
but
really
rolls
across
the
tongue
well
while
working
the
palate
ill
do
this
one
again
and
definitely
will
recommend
to
my
beer
buddies
and
what
not
but
this
is
not
a
regular
in
my
fridge
or
cellar
d
highly
drinkable
earthy
citrusy
malt
just
a
subtle
bitterness
and
some
strong
belgian
yeast
blends
together
perfectly
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
given
the
other
flavors
and
im
generally
sensitive
of
the
balance
of
spices
this
one
is
spot
on
and
perfect
for
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
if
not
hoarding
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
but
still
glad
i
tried
it
i
must
say
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
pours
a
hazy
golden
blond
color
with
a
great
white
head
that
stays
around
until
its
gone
smells
of
sweet
citrus
flavors
and
spices
the
taste
was
amazing
so
many
sweet
citrus
flavors
with
the
perfect
blend
of
spices
and
minimal
hops
some
wheat
flavors
too
reminded
me
of
a
tripel
no
overpowering
bitterness
or
hop
bite
a
great
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
made
is
so
smooth
going
down
and
the
alcohol
was
completely
masked
a
great
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
d
great
drinkability
especially
after
refinishing
a
door
a
remarkably
refreshing
ale
that
cuts
through
the
saw
dust
excellent
representative
of
the
style
highly
recommended
this
may
be
rough
to
some
but
i
thought
this
was
a
great
ale
the
flavor
has
a
delightful
fruitysweetness
and
very
clean
malt
clean
is
a
good
word
here
subtle
wheat
flavors
corriander
and
spices
lemmon
zest
very
crispy
with
a
dash
of
heather
honey
the
yeast
is
a
bit
too
laid
back
for
this
style
its
verging
on
being
a
classic
golden
ale
without
the
classic
belgian
big
yeast
profile
that
i
love
so
much
the
hops
are
very
bold
in
there
fruitiness
and
the
malt
is
clean
so
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
strays
far
away
from
the
stlye
at
hand
slight
banana
and
cloves
pop
out
near
the
end
along
with
a
more
leafy
hop
flavor
and
a
sourmalty
lingering
aftertaste
overall
this
light
crispy
sharp
even
feeling
ale
is
easy
on
the
palate
and
watch
out
for
its
deceptive
7

abv
feels
quite
decent
on
the
palate
though
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
my
tastes
overall
quite
a
drinkable
brew
awesome

verry
interesting
orangy
collor
i
wish
i
had
got
to
poor
it
instead
of
the
waitress
this
beer
should
have
had
a
nice
head
on
it
smelled
pretty
fruity
and
tasted
just
like
expected
slight
citrus
undertone
very
easy
to
drink
rather
fizzy
id
probably
rate
this
higher
if
i
hadnt
had
a
duvel
right
before
this
but
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
medium
bodied
yet
refreshing
although
carbonation
is
slightly
under
what
i
desired
earthy
fruity
yeasty
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
underneath
not
sweet
not
dry
somewhere
comfortable
in
the
middle
highly
drinkable
a
very
well
crafted
american
version
of
a
belgian
classic
certainly
worthwhile
full
creamy
feel
developed
through
a
combination
of
the
alcohol
strength
and
carbonation
imparted
from
the
bottle
conditioning
the
fruit
can
be
a
bit
much
at
times
but
altogether
a
fine
brew
from
an
underrated
brewery
d
this
is
a
sipper
7
6
but
what
a
great
beer
it
really
feels
more
like
a
weizenbock
to
me
but
regardless
its
tasty
this
will
definitely
be
had
again
and
again
looks
really
great
reminds
me
alot
of
matilda
from
goose
island
with
a
nice
golden
brown
hue
to
it
and
a
tiny
head
and
little
carbonation
smell
is
amazing
it
smells
like
gala
apples
a
sweet
light
citrusy
aroma
taste
is
very
good
a
wonderful
yeast
flavor
hits
the
tongue
first
then
spicy
hops
and
warm
malt
its
just
really
good
mouthfeel
is
decent
many
belgians
have
alot
more
carbonation
than
this
one
drinkability
is
very
high
its
just
so
damn
good
this
was
a
better
beer
than
i
had
expected
it
has
a
big
yeasty
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
it
has
a
sweet
and
citrusy
smell
that
contrasts
well
with
the
flavor
without
overpowering
it
the
flavor
has
some
spice
and
the
styles
earthiness
although
notably
different
than
the
belgian
versions
that
ive
tried
the
aftertaste
has
a
good
amount
of
dryness
which
combines
with
a
healthy
bite
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
an
attractively
murky
glass
of
pure
gold
with
a
bright
head
pranqster
is
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
drinkable
north
coast
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
definitely
does
not
rank
as
my
favorite
beer
of
theirs
overall
much
better
than
i
expected
a
great
strong
pale
belgian
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
i
have
nothing
against
north
coast
at
all
and
it
is
possible
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
did
see
some
similarities
in
a
few
other
reviews
poured
half
the
glass
down
the
drain
i
think
its
called
pranqster
for
a
good
reason
their
goal
was
lets
see
how
overly
offensive
we
can
make
this
beer
so
people
will
be
tricked
into
thinking
they
actually
like
it
i
think
im
going
to
wash
this
taste
out
my
mouth
with
some
pbr
this
beer
is
no
joke
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
decent
sized
initial
head
which
tapers
off
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
fruity
but
quite
mild
theres
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
here
though
which
was
a
bit
surprising
based
on
the
mild
aroma
its
fruity
spicy
yeasty
slightly
tangy
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
very
well
balanced
theres
enough
there
for
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
and
its
quite
refreshing
7

and
it
really
doesnt
seem
like
its
that
high
north
coast
once
again
provides
high
quality
for
an
affordable
price
well
done
i
like
this
and
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
its
a
little
different
but
i
think
it
does
the
style
justice
and
was
satisfying
at
the
same
time
if
you
are
a
fan
of
strong
golden
or
perhaps
belgian
trips
give
this
one
a
try
taste
is
malt
pepper
alcohol
yeast
citrus
the
citrus
departs
in
the
aftertaste
good
flavor
but
slightly
watery
texture
very
light
effervescence
a
good
beer
but
not
great
solid
middle
of
the
road
look
is
orange
tinted
ple
yellow
with
a
smallish
buut
vibrant
white
head
sell
spicey
and
fruity
with
green
apple
pear
clove
and
pepper
being
there
the
taste
very
nicely
ballance
and
much
like
the
smell
you
can
taste
all
the
elements
but
none
are
overpowering
maby
it
was
my
bottle
but
i
thought
for
a
belgain
pale
it
was
a
little
under
carbinated
but
thats
my
only
real
gripe
overall
a
very
good
brew
this
was
a
truly
disappointing
brew
four
12oz
bottles
purchased
for
something
like
9
75
from
choice
mart
or
whatever
thats
called
on
mass
ave
in
boston
not
my
usual
haunt
but
thought
id
stop
in
no
freshness
date
which
can
be
a
concern
here
but
i
thought
this
style
would
be
safe
enough
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
tons
of
bubbles
and
a
bit
of
head
nice
yeasty
aroma
first
taste
follows
the
aroma
all
yeast
with
a
slight
spiciness
as
it
goes
down
tripellike
not
overly
complex
or
exciting
or
perhaps
i
burned
out
after
a
rash
of
similartasting
tripels
this
is
nice
but
i
definitely
need
to
move
the
rest
of
these
bad
boys
to
the
fridge
door
that
cold
is
a
taste
killer
good
solid
well
made
stuff
not
really
my
speed
style
wise
but
quality
for
what
it
is
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
the
highlight
for
me
banana
apple
belgian
yeastiness
other
fruits
really
great
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
at
the
top
after
it
settles
medium
to
full
body
with
decent
carbonation
no
doubt
when
tasting
it
that
it
is
a
belgian
style
ale
alcohol
comes
through
very
nicely
sweet
aftertaste
is
enjoyable
definitely
drinkable
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
taste
still
good
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
but
leaves
ok
lace
nose
is
very
grainy
with
some
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
nice
graininess
light
subtle
hops
and
good
yeast
character
grassy
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
thick
maybe
drinkability
is
quite
good
but
not
amazing
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
one
i
am
thouroughly
impressed
with
a
good
one
to
try
pretty
sessionable
for
the
abv
good
brew
pretty
darn
good
it
really
grew
on
me
im
not
used
to
the
style
but
im
eager
to
try
more
pranqster
is
a
delicious
duvelstyle
beer
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
one
of
my
favorite
american
interpretations
of
the
style
i
find
myself
picking
this
one
up
every
now
and
then
the
price
is
tough
to
beat
too
d
solid
all
around
very
well
done
d
very
drinkable
even
with
all
the
flavor
and
spice
going
on
a
really
tasty
rendition
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
a
treat
drinkability
is
groovy
sorry
evil
dead
ii
in
the
background
very
drinkable
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
smooth
and
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
typical
pale
ale
but
the
execution
is
worth
i
like
it
drinkability
well
worth
trying
one
of
the
best
american
belgian
ales
ive
had
maybe
the
best
bought
a
single
bottle
at
my
favorite
shop
pours
a
great
cloudy
orange
color
the
carbonation
was
decent
but
the
head
diminished
too
soon
good
aroma
of
fruits
and
spices
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
and
tastes
great
extremely
smooth
and
highly
refreshing
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
overall
this
is
definitely
a
good
and
tasty
beer
but
its
not
especially
bold
very
balanced
and
wellrounded
all
over
and
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
this
is
quite
up
to
the
same
standard
as
duvel
or
delirium
but
a
very
good
beer
none
the
less
i
dont
know
the
coriander
was
a
bit
much
for
me
its
just
not
a
flavor
im
fond
of
and
it
is
all
too
present
here
normally
i
love
north
coast
but
this
appears
to
be
the
exception
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
i
enjoy
i
like
it
as
much
if
not
more
than
duvel
a
most
try
for
people
that
love
the
style
nice
beer
another
fine
offering
from
north
coast
will
definately
buy
another
4pack
soon
highly
recommended
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
floral
with
some
malt
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is

some
pears
and
apple
flavors
and
other
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
pranqster
is
a
pretty
solid
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
but
falls
short
compared
to
some
of
the
classic
bspas
brewed
over
in
belgium
worth
a
shot
d
very
smooth
goes
down
almost
to
easey
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
with
a
6
pack
it
will
do
you
right
for
the
price
d
incredibly
drinkable
does
this
have
nicotine
in
it
i
just
stopped
thinking
and
started
drinking
and
enjoying
myself
with
it
a
very
enjoyable
and
possibly
refreshing
brew
at
7
6
though
you
need
to
be
careful
not
to
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
dvery
high
not
that
you
need
many
but
it
seems
to
evaporate
quickly
poured
into
my
spaten
beer
mug
the
brew
comes
to
a
beautiful
eggwhite
head
dense
golden
color
with
a
brassy
neon
highlights
around
the
sides
of
the
mug
head
has
reduced
to
a
12
inch
sheet
which
sits
atop
the
brew
peering
through
the
brew
there
are
a
ton
of
small
bubbles
sheets
of
them
making
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
bubble
gum
and
banana
bread
taste
is
excellent
honey
fruity
and
highly
pleasing
after
a
few
mouthfuls
the
has
some
soapy
suds
but
no
lacing
this
brew
to
go
along
with
the
old
rasputin
russian
stout
is
wonderful
pranqster
is
a
quality
brew
that
i
will
be
enjoying
the
rest
of
this
summer
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
would
only
want
a
few
to
start
a
session
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
wish
i
had
gotten
this
earlier
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
on
the
palate
with
crisp
and
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
that
are
quite
appropriately
proportioned
at
lower
levels
as
afore
mentioned
it
has
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
beer
id
definitely
pick
up
again
quite
a
step
in
a
different
direction
for
they
style
this
is
much
different
what
others
try
to
produce
when
making
this
style
i
really
like
this
take
on
the
style
it
is
different
and
fresh
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
d
very
drinkable
with
a
big
malt
load
with
distinctive
fruit
and
spice
notes
easier
to
drink
than
most
belgian
ales
and
a
nice
price
smooth
and
mediumbodied
the
drink
is
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
lasts
it
has
that
wonderful
belgian
farm
like
smell
that
only
comes
for
a
belgian
yeast
strain
the
flavor
is
quite
amazingthey
nailed
this
style
for
sure
this
is
yet
another
american
beer
that
is
more
like
a
belgian
than
an
old
one
that
has
been
on
the
shelf
from
belgium
the
carbonation
is
very
high
as
expected
and
the
beer
finishes
dry
it
also
has
a
decent
body
making
it
quite
a
full
beer
seek
this
one
outit
is
quite
amazing
terrific
beer
on
draft
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
stray
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
is
slow
to
diminish
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
fruits
spice
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweetness
hops
and
spice
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
and
took
a
while
to
drink
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
but
not
something
id
choose
that
often
a
4
pack
from
tullys
this
was
a
really
good
beer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
it
was
an
orange
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
it
had
a
fruity
and
earthy
aroma
banana
flavor
balanced
by
the
malt
late
hops
appearance
highly
recommend
this
beer
more
than
quaffable
considering
its
strength
wouldnt
hesitate
offering
this
one
to
any
fan
of
the
pale
belgians
i
enjoy
the
wilder
yeast
presence
and
similar
complex
taste
i
cant
nail
all
of
the
flavors
here
but
everything
in
there
is
pleasant
i
went
back
to
the
store
and
bought
the
remaining
two
4
packs
pours
hazed
apricot
hue
with
a
light
sheet
of
lace
that
hugs
the
stemless
pinot
noir
glass
feeble
aroma
but
picking
up
sweet
vanilla
little
spice
and
a
surprising
whiff
of
oaky
chardonnay
amazingly
the
flavor
makes
up
for
everything
the
nose
lets
down
pranqster
lives
up
to
its
name
by
unveiling
a
worldclass
taste
each
sip
brings
a
candi
sugar
that
laces
the
lips
spicy
hops
pale
malt
and
that
quintessential
belgian
yeast
flavor
this
brew
is
full
of
flavor
and
a
strong
mouthful
with
an
expected
powerful
carbonation
this
brew
has
high
drinkability
but
consume
with
moderation
for
pranqster
will
fool
you
with
its
high
alcohol
content
m
d
nice
medium
body
almost
a
little
syrupy
a
sipper
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
for
being
sippers
which
is
nice
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
could
only
have
2
or
3
d
overall
a
nice
take
on
a
bspa
very
complex
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
maybe
a
nice
fruit
pie
or
cobbler
on
the
side
would
round
things
out
still
the
pleasant
aroma
entices
me
as
soon
as
the
glass
gets
close
to
my
face
the
pranqster
is
an
excellent
interpretation
of
this
style
if
you
like
this
style
and
can
get
this
beer
get
it
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
dont
really
notice
the
abv
in
the
taste
yet
it
would
stop
me
from
having
a
lot
of
them
the
taste
even
though
i
had
trouble
describing
it
is
definitely
a
good
one
this
even
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
few
tripels
that
i
have
had
given
the
fruitiness
in
the
nose
and
taste
id
have
to
say
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
one
its
such
a
great
all
around
beer
its
very
fullflavored
with
lots
of
character
and
yet
it
looks
like
an
easy
drinking
light
tasting
beer
dont
let
that
fool
you
the
pranqster
is
just
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
but
fairly
light
and
really
refreshing
nonetheless
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
the
beer
drank
pretty
much
the
same
from
start
to
finish
leading
to
a
one
dimensional
profile
with
not
much
spicing
ok
just
nothing
nothing
spectacular
and
gets
boring
after
1
or
2
drinkability
is
great
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
i
mean
more
than
three
easily
this
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
really
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
over
top
pleasant
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
floral
note
flavor
is
very
fruity
with
a
nice
clean
finish
and
notes
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
a
beer
of
this
style
and
abv
good
beer
the
taste
is
wonderful
it
has
fullbodied
fruitiness
with
a
light
spiciness
some
grain
especially
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
lemon
this
is
rounded
out
with
a
light
nicely
pungent
alcholic
body
its
rather
sweet
with
no
real
bitterness
but
this
is
good
here
and
complemented
by
the
firm
character
and
zestiness
its
on
the
light
side
and
slightly
fizzy
but
tasty
and
zesty
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
yet
theres
still
some
room
for
improvement
id
have
it
again
sometime
but
wasnt
knocked
out
by
it
d
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
most
of
north
coasts
beers
are
better
though
d
its
a
good
belgian
golden
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
not
something
to
turn
down
i
suppose
that
despite
my
what
is
missing
comment
i
really
do
not
know
enough
about
beer
to
say
something
is
really
neededstill
an
opinion
is
an
opinion
this
will
be
something
to
look
forward
to
because
i
do
not
think
the
abv
is
too
high
or
too
low
maybe
not
session
beerbut
one
could
have
a
few
smells
a
tad
bit
spicy
some
malt
aromas
also
on
nose
taste
is
much
better
than
smell
with
slight
tropical
fruit
hints
that
banana
taste
that
comes
from
belgian
yeast
nice
bubbles
and
good
finish
make
for
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
easily
drinkable
but
there
is
something
missing
cant
quite
place
it
d
drinkable
brew
possibly
best
american
brew
to
taste
like
a
belgian
blonde
that
ive
tasted
enjoyable
i
love
it
when
domestic
brewers
get
foreign
styles
right
like
all
belgian
strong
pale
ales
therere
a
lot
of
flavors
goin
on
with
this
one
if
the
carbonation
profile
on
this
one
were
to
be
diminished
slightly
and
the
alcohol
hidden
a
little
better
this
would
be
a
worldclass
american
interpretation
good
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
if
hte
flavor
lasted
longer
it
would
be
much
better
d
best
belgian
ale
i
have
had
hides
the
abv
almost
a
bit
too
well
drank
3
of
these
pretty
quick
worth
the
price
good
beer
the
drinkability
is
also
great
it
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
light
you
can
drink
many
of
these
many
drinkability
this
one
disappoints
me
and
i
hate
to
say
that
because
i
love
old
rasputin
ris
puts
out
i
always
how
this
can
be
the
same
brewery
when
i
have
this
they
deserve
another
shot
but
this
one
isnt
my
flavor
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
for
the
style
finish
is
bone
dry
body
is
thinnish
pretty
drinkable
but
its
too
sweet
for
my
taste
bright
golden
pour
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
smell
is
strongly
metallic
wtih
a
strong
yeast
smell
behind
that
taste
is
decent
but
bland
very
generic
belgian
strong
ale
flavor
to
me
malty
yeasty
and
some
detracting
metallic
flavors
quite
bubbly
mouthfeel
not
particular
spectacular
rerate
in
the
bottle
wow
a
different
story
seems
to
lose
its
sweetness
in
the
glass
a
shadow
if
its
beauty
should
only
be
allowed
on
tap
nice
and
clean
as
a
light
sessionable
belgian
effort
without
as
much
of
a
typical
complex
flavor
profile
good
gateway
beer
d
yeah
pretty
drinkable
good
belgian
golden
ale
but
nothing
exceptional
still
its
more
than
adequate
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
into
my
duvel
tulip
decent
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
very
little
lacing
smell
was
sweet
and
somewhat
grassy
taste
was
equally
as
sweet
with
a
nice
banana
finish
that
did
not
linger
overall
a
good
brew
not
my
favorite
belgian
golden
by
any
means
butone
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
and
would
recommend
to
someone
who
wasnt
able
to
get
a
true
belgian
golden
such
as
duvel
or
delerium
and
on
my
own
tap
to
boot
the
appearance
is
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
persistent
head
ropy
lacing
the
smell
is
phenols
pepper
and
a
hint
of
something
barnish
tastes
of
pepper
honey
and
a
sweet
malt
finish
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
a
slick
full
body
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
be
interesting
the
drinkability
is
excellent
with
the
alcohol
just
barely
making
itself
known
in
the
end
my
advice
get
two
kegs
overall
its
a
tough
crowd
to
fight
amongst
and
the
tapped
version
of
pranqster
seems
to
hold
up
to
strong
scrutiny
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
bspa
or
a
strong
flavorful
ale
do
not
be
afraid
pours
a
hazy
straworange
with
a
quick
to
settle
head
smells
very
bready
and
yeasty
wasnt
hit
with
a
lot
of
booziness
but
started
to
get
that
headache
just
from
smelling
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
not
much
sweetness
to
it
fairly
dry
a
slight
toffeeness
and
a
somewhat
grainy
aftertaste
pretty
lively
carbonation
in
the
mouth
the
lightness
makes
it
sessionable
not
necessarily
offensive
but
not
what
i
would
expect
could
be
a
good
transition
beer
to
bigger
belgian
styles
for
people
that
are
not
used
to
them
for
the
alcohol
content
this
beer
was
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
pretty
good
and
i
know
i
will
pick
some
more
of
it
up
again
by
the
way
the
guys
picture
in
the
lower
right
corner
had
me
cracking
up
on
the
label
this
beer
poured
a
pretty
orangetinged
opaque
copper
with
a
fluffy
yellowish
head
that
stays
for
a
while
the
smell
is
of
pear
or
apple
fruitiness
with
some
yeastiness
and
perhaps
a
tinge
of
floral
scents
the
taste
starts
off
fruity
with
hints
of
pear
and
banana
that
gives
way
to
some
cloves
and
spiciness
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
warming
and
makes
for
pleasant
drinking
this
beer
is
nice
and
complex
but
not
too
snooty
to
drink
all
night
a
real
surprise
for
me
ill
definitely
be
picking
it
up
again
north
coast
did
a
good
job
with
the
one
d
a
phenomenal
beer
nice
color
smell
and
offset
of
sweetness
not
sure
it
can
be
done
better
dthis
stuff
is
interesting
and
satisfying
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
after
randomly
grabbing
this
bottle
in
the
make
your
own
6pack
section
of
a
local
retailer
to
fill
my
last
space
average
at
best
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
had
a
bit
too
tart
a
finish
for
me
the
taste
wasnt
as
complex
as
you
normally
see
with
many
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
but
it
was
pretty
decent
nonetheless
i
think
i
paid
around
7
for
the
4
pack
a
very
good
beer
an
excellent
beer
for
the
price
on
the
nose
not
a
huge
sour
yeast
smell
as
found
in
beers
from
belgian
the
taste
is
where
this
beers
power
lies
tart
fruity
warm
in
the
throat
yet
creamy
in
satisfying
spices
come
throughale
yeasts
orange
peel
something
lavenderlike
the
mouthfeel
is
different
than
i
expected
offering
a
more
creamy
and
coating
feel
rather
than
biting
and
carbonated
very
tasty
brew
very
well
done
d
this
beer
is
definitely
aging
well
a
much
more
mellow
and
smooth
taste
with
a
much
more
fragrant
nose
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
in
about
2
years
d
the
abv
is
little
big
but
its
in
the
belgian
style
and
few
belgians
come
short
on
the
alcohol
overall
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
the
brewer
should
be
proud
they
nailed
it
drinkablity
tasty
brew
that
does
not
overpower
the
strong
yeast
presence
does
not
detract
from
the
other
flavors
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
2
finger
head
that
is
not
quite
as
large
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
stong
the
head
only
settles
by
half
settling
into
a
thick
clingy
collar
i
see
the
usual
belgian
effervescence
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
swirling
in
the
glass
aroma
is
of
candy
sugar
sweet
fruits
peaches
apricots
grapes
the
fruity
characteristic
dominates
the
taste
at
first
with
some
spice
floral
notes
and
no
hint
of
the
7
6
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
and
sparkly
from
all
the
bubbles
almost
champagnelike
dangerously
drinkable
due
to
its
medium
body
luscious
flavor
and
how
well
hidden
the
alcohol
is
overall
id
say
ive
found
a
new
favorite
among
belgians
this
one
can
stand
tall
and
proud
among
anything
from
overseas
a
wonderful
interpretation
of
a
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ale
malty
with
a
nice
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
herbalhay
earthiness
recommended
without
a
doubt
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
sampled
from
north
coast
true
to
the
style
authentic
greattasting
highclass
and
topnotch
appearance
was
good
with
a
goldencolored
hue
with
minimal
head
smell
was
full
of
freshfruits
canteloupe
melons
and
citrus
amazing
fruity
sweet
taste
that
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
flavor
complete
with
banans
sugars
and
cottoncandy
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
for
a
7
6
abv
crisp
refreshing
and
satisfying
copped
a
short
fat
12oz
bottle
from
total
wine
and
more
in
union
great
depiction
of
the
style
allaround
highquality
brew
definitely
recommended
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
at
a
local
retailer
that
allows
single
bottle
purchases
the
first
two
things
i
noticed
upon
pouring
were
that
there
was
very
little
head
and
that
this
beer
was
very
clear
like
budweiser
clear
undeterred
i
kept
going
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
beer
doesnt
exactly
look
like
it
belongs
in
the
same
category
as
the
great
belgians
but
it
holds
its
own
there
is
a
very
fruity
yeast
flavor
that
is
predominant
but
hops
are
also
detectable
deep
in
the
taste
i
think
this
beer
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
the
appearance
while
not
expected
is
pleasant
enough
i
find
this
to
be
an
extemely
drinkable
beer
that
will
find
a
home
for
me
in
common
meals
like
fish
and
chips
chili
etc
i
love
pranqster
because
its
cheap
for
the
style
and
still
delivers
that
taste
of
belgium
without
breaking
the
beer
budget
it
is
bottle
conditioned
so
i
wonder
will
it
cellar
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
north
coast
d
i
was
let
down
by
this
one
and
thats
all
there
is
to
it
its
not
a
terrible
brewits
just
something
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
i
wont
pay
for
this
one
again
drinkability
was
quite
pleasant
and
at
only
7
it
wont
hurt
you
too
badly
drinkability
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
often
but
it
is
still
oh
so
nice
orange
amber
body
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
head
gradually
fades
to
leave
a
few
small
islands
of
foam
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
a
little
grainy
and
has
some
yeasty
notes
flavor
is
a
bit
phenolic
at
first
and
seems
to
progress
more
in
that
direction
with
a
few
more
sips
some
sweetness
comes
through
mostly
sugary
and
then
some
astringency
and
hop
bitterness
is
noticed
somewhat
metallic
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
poor
id
come
to
a
beer
of
this
style
looking
for
an
expereince
not
another
average
offering
overall
this
was
not
bad
at
all
i
will
admit
of
course
that
i
have
had
better
but
this
was
a
solid
belgian
pale
and
i
would
not
really
hesitate
to
try
it
again
i
am
sure
this
one
really
rocks
on
tap
but
the
bottle
was
not
so
bad
either
a
solid
offering
drinkability
a
good
belgian
and
another
good
beer
from
north
coast
my
only
real
disappointment
is
the
lack
of
head
which
i
think
helps
to
define
a
belgian
and
deliver
some
of
those
aromatics
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
north
coast
brewing
but
i
cant
think
of
one
thing
they
have
done
that
i
havent
thought
was
beyond
good
this
particular
brew
is
damn
even
and
is
exactly
the
style
that
i
appreciate
most
i
wish
i
could
point
something
out
that
i
didnt
like
about
it
but
i
just
cant
find
a
flaw
give
it
a
try
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
worthy
beverage
all
around
malty
backbone
to
this
one
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
character
and
a
hoppy
finish
as
well
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
up
i
wonder
how
old
this
bottle
is
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
really
expected
this
to
be
better
than
it
was
i
like
most
of
north
coasts
other
stuff
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
feels
fizzy
and
thick
warm
like
whiskey
on
the
way
down
its
a
sipper
because
of
its
thick
creamy
fizzyness
has
a
decent
bitterspicy
combination
its
really
not
my
thing
but
good
enough
mouth
happiness
apertiff
with
entree
nightcap
d
recommended
if
fresh
age
does
this
brew
no
favors
one
of
the
better
american
made
belgian
pales
dont
miss
out
on
this
delicious
belgian
style
pale
ale
very
tasty
and
worth
grabbing
poured
into
an
oversize
wine
glass
presented
with
a
beautiful
goldenorange
color
smell
of
belgian
yeast
and
coriander
consistent
foamy
white

throughout
the
tasting
with
ample
belgian
lacing
adhering
to
the
side
of
the
glass

of
coriander
with
peppery
undertones
generously
effervescent
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
mild
finish
considering
the
7
6
abv
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
just
a
tiny
white
skim
of
head
the
aroma
is
intensely
fruity
peppery
and
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
highly
fruity
and
spicy
with
low
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
tart
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
i
havent
had
many
but
i
always
want
to
try
new
styles
this
one
seems
to
do
the
style
well
i
am
ranking
this
to
the
style
not
to
my
preferences
if
i
was

to
my

the
pranqster
comes
in

and
pours
a
light
orange
with
very
little
foam
head
it
leaves
a
thin
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass

smell

tastes
spicy

and
finishes

light

the
touch
in
the
mouth
and
is
a
very
pleasing
belgian
golden
the
abv
is
hidden
well
this
is
a
pleasant
equivalent
of
a
belgian
ale
pours
an
almost
unnatural
candy
orange
color
with
a
small
fizz
of
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
aroma
masks
the
alcohol
but
it
is
still
strong
belgian
candi
sugar
and
something
sweet
and
vegetal
cant
say
i
like
it
it
seems
slightly
out
of
balance
theres
a
bit
of
astringency
nearly
sour
but
not
quite
sort
of
boozy
like
a
tripel
but
without
any
subtlely
vague
fruit
hint
but
just
barely
fuller
mouthfeel
but
it
goes
flat
after
awhile
not
recommended
for
cellaring
good
lighter
style

for
warmer
months

session
drinking
i
was
actually
surprised
to
notice
the
high

hidden

had
no
idea

grain
bread

taste
is
mild

bitter
the
alcohol

overly
apparent
this

really
like

comment
excellent
take
on
belgium
strong
pale
ales
i
expected
an
american
twist
to
the
old
school
but
was
well
satisfied
with
this
knock
of
of
the
belgium
standard
sharp
and
tangy
it
was
a
good
brew
but
just
not
worth
the
pricey
tag
for
the
four
pack
a
cross
between
belgian
golden
and
triple
in
my
book
very
flavorful
no
flaws
love
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
because
it
is
pretty
light
for
a
strong
ale
pours

slightly
hazy
orange
copper
color

shortlived

hints

well
balanced

mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
carbonation
is
a
great
complement
overall
a
nice
drinking
belgian
golden
ale
for
an
american
belgianstyle
ale
this
beer
stands
out
in
its
category
a
must
try
for
any
belgian
ale
fan
i
ultimately
found
this
brew
disappointing
it
isnt
the
home
run
that
north
coasts
old
rasputin
is
and
it
doesnt
stack
up
especially
well
next
to
duvel
the
flavors
never
seem
to
come
into
their
own
and
the
head
in
particular
disappoints
a
great
belgian
for
the
price
for
6
of
these
bad
boys
you
would
only
be
able
to
get
one
or
two
of
the
bigger
names
overall
i
was
a
bit
let
down
with
this
beer
i
expected
something
paler
and
drier
and
i
guess
a
little
prettier
in
the
glass
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
that
would
make
me
a
fan
of
it
compared
to
other
north
coast
brews
such
as
red
seal
and
old
rasputin

great
value
another
great
beer
from
north
coast
i
havent
had
duvel
in
awhile
but
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
more
d
this
is
a
good
belgianstyle
beer
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
north
coast
pranqster
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
pale
malts
pared
with
an
almost
vinous
sweetness
there
is
subtle
bready
yeast
character
the
taste
is
packed
with
flavors
a
sharp
yeasty
bite
gives
way
to
sweet
malts
followed
by
an
almost
citrusy
hop
flavor
the
after
taste
is
almost
sour
no
alcohol
flavor
to
speak
of
so
this
one
is
very
drinkable
at
7
6
d
very
drinkable
there
are
obviously
better
belgian
and
belgian
style
golden
ales
out
there
this
is
a
decent
alternative
to
the
more
expensive
ones
without
giving
up
much
quality
a
decent
pickup
this
is
hard
to
stomach
needs
a
retry
sometime
far
away
i
am
supremely
disappointed
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
disappointing
head
kind
of
flat
for
belgian
standards
the
smell
is
rather
faint
some
light
candi
sugar
funk
aroma
the
taste
is
more
pronounced
a
big
hit
of
candi
sugar
caramelized
banana
a
bit
boozy
some
tart
apple
but
more
on
the
sweet
side
the
feel
is
moderate
and
crisp
finishes
more
on
the
slick
side
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
though
it
borders
on
the
tripel
style
it
could
use
more
of
a
malt
presence
to
offset
the
sweetness
and
hide
the
alcohol
better
this
is
probably
much
better
with
a
meal
something
like
a
roast
turkey
in
fact
that
does
sound
tasty
with
this
in
comparison
to
something
like
brooklyn
local

i
actually
enjoyed
this
slightly
more
due
to
its
drinkability
drinkability
far
too
sour
and
yeasty
for
my
tastes
i
think
ill
keep
to
their
old
rasputin
and
old
stock
ale
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
at
first
but
the
flavours
really
came
out
as
it
warmed
the
initial
alcohol
warmth
had
a
bite
but
it
too
mellowed
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
quite
enjoying
it
a
fantastic
beer
it
really
hits
my
sweet
spot
for
complexity
body
and
strength
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
yes
i
can
ive
got
plenty
well
see
how
long
i
can
hold
on
to
them
and
how
well
they
age
but
if
they
get
better
then
they
are
now
its
all
gravy
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
then
heavily
clouded
by
the
yeast
pour
three
finger
soap
bubble
head
showing
good
retention
and
terrific
patchwork
of
lacing
spicy
belgian
phenolics
pilsener
malt
and
styrian
hops
make
up
the
inticing
aroma
with
a
whiff
of
booze
and
tropical
fruit
becoming
stronger
as
it
warms
sharp
pils
soft
wheat
and
pale
candy
sugar
upon
the
first
sip
the
aftertaste
is
quite
dry
with
very
light
noble
hop
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
but
a
showcase
of
bubblegum
and
spicy
phenolics
balance
the
malt
well
light
and
airy
body
though
it
seems
like
a
once
heavy
beer
thinned
out
from
simple
sugars
the
carbonation
is
aggressive
and
needlelike
which
aids
in
lifting
the
strong
malt
presence
and
phenols
from
the
tounge
the
finish
shows
some
earthy
yeast
tones
a
little
booze
and
some
residual
swetness
but
the
yeast
character
fades
gracefully
with
the
malt
and
never
becomes
significantly
cloying
or
hot
an
excellent
american
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
an
outstanding
golden
alestrong
paleetc
well
balanced
and
refreshing
definitely
worth
the
effort
to
go
out
and
find
one
an
american
brew
that
has
certainly
held
up
to
classic
belgian
standards
two
thumbs
up
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
when
youre
in
a
belgian
kind
of
mood
but
you
dont
want
to
get
yourself
destroyed
too
quickly
i
picked
this
bottle
up
at
premier
on
elmwood
ave
in
kenmore
ny
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
to
be
not
overly
expensive
it
poured
a
cloudy
golden
haze
i
could
smell
the
bananas
and
coriander
the
taste
was
very
good
i
enjoyed
it
better
than
many
of
the
ales
that
come
directly
from
belgium
the
alcohol
was
understated
so
that
i
could
enjoy
the
complex
flavors
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
pear
it
pours
out
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
fairly
persistent
head
flavor
is
malty
with
fruity
tones
and
a
nice
alcohol
kick
on
the
tongue
it
feels
smooth
and
rich
a
satisfying
ale
that
goes
down
the
pipes
very
pleasantly
and
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
tasty
and
recommended
d
not
bad
i
would
prefer
many
other
belgian
ales
but
this
is
quite
good
for
a
brewery
that
doesnt
specialize
in
belgian
styles
12oz
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
foamy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
layer
some
light
lacing
around
the
glass
aromas
of
orange
wheat
and
some
sweet
banana
flavors
are
clove
lightly
bitter
orange
and
yeast
this
is
a
medium
to
fullbodied
beer
it
has
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
good
dose
of
carbonation
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
effort
from
north
coast
in
the
mouth
this
stuff
is
aggressively
carbonated
and
almost
stings
the
tongue
drinkability
a
little
elevated
on
the
abv
still
good
for
a
few
though
its
difficult
to
believe
that
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
had
this
ultrareadily
available
offering
from
north
coast
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
try
it
sooner
it
poured
a
cloudy
orange
juice
orange
with
some
very
fine
particles
floating
about
pure
white
foamy
head
lasted
all
of
about
60
seconds
fading
away
into
a
thin
frosting
over
the
liquids
surface
while
the
head
was
at
its
fullest
it
appeared
very
thick
this
thickness
remained
in
the
lacing
smell
was
sweet
fruit
yeast
and
a
damp
cellar
i
thought
this
combination
was
quite
pleasant
taste
was
sweet
fruit
up
front
a
tiny
bit
of
that
metallic
taste
thats
so
common
among
belgians
in
the
middle
and
then
a
dry
cornbased
breakfast
cereal
finish
corn
pops
anyone
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
for
the
style
i
must
admit
i
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
is
a
really
nice
attempt
by
americans
at
a
belgian
style
i
like
thisits
a
smooth
belgian
i
will
look
for
it
again
d
not
so
hot
this
is
really
full
and
sweet
and
though
i
like
the
full
body
it
combines
with
the
cloyng
sweetness
to
really
make
this
seem
like
eating
the
icing
off
of
a
birthday
cake
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
milewide
belgian
strong
ale
style
it
is
light
and
very
clovey
this
beer
pours
a
lemonade
color
with
little
head
but
an
obviously
high
level
of
carbonation
a
lot
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
my
beerclean
glass
aroma
and
flavor
was
very
clovey
mouthfeel
was
champagnelike
with
a
lot
of
tickling
bubbles
drinkability
a
definite
and
would
recommend
to
friends

i
could
barely
put
the
glass
down
it
is
very
enjoyable
d
not
surprising
that
a
topnotch
us
brewer
like
north
coast
makes
this
very
good
example
of
a
complex
belgian
style
well
very
tasty
satisfying
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
ill
definitely
have
this
again
d
very
good
drinkability
quite
hoppy
and
spicey
again
i
tried
this
in
a
bar
setting
on
tap
so
i
think
i
have
an
advantage
over
people
drinking
it
out
of
a
bottle
i
would
like
to
visit
the
next
time
i
am
up
in
nor
cal
along
the
coast
see
what
it
tastes
like
directly
from
the
source
d
very
interesting
spiciness
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
i
really
like
belgian
pales
and
this
one
is
a
very
nice
representation
it
pours
a
cloudy
peachyorange
one
sniff
from
the
bottle
and
youll
swear
its
belgian
very
sweet
fruityyeasty
smells
dominate
the
aroma
its
a
little
lighter
tasting
for
the
style
but
it
still
has
that
ripe
fruits
taste
with
a
black
pepper
finish
a
little
biscuity
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
starts
to
warm
up
overall
its
a
pleasant
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
too
many
comparisons
to
duvel
had
my
expectations
rigid
going
in
but
once
i
got
past
that
prejudice
i
was
very
happy
with
this
and
as
stated
above
im
off
to
drink
my
second
bottle
d
it
is
very
tasty
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
and
i
can
see
it
being
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
nice
attempt
at
the
style
there
are
better
belgian
strong
pale
ales
out
there
though
footnote
from
the
north
coast
website
the
label
is
adapted
from
a
classic
belgian
engraving
by
de
loose
it
depicts
old
world
brewmasters
ruedrich
among
them
gathered
around
a
festive
table
enjoying
the
fruits
of
their
labors
drinkability
not
to
shabby
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
for
this
style
a
pretty
tasty
brew
with
a
fairly
considering
low
abv
definitely
could
enjoy
two
or
three
of
these
bad
boys
and
still
walk
home
overall
a
very
belgian
very
drinkable
very
delicious
ale
among
a
blind
tasting
among
other
standards
from
across
the
atlantic
im
not
sure
who
would
win
frankly
but
at
this
price
point
under
7
for
4
12ozers
pranqster
will
win
more
often
than
not
in
my
cellar
er
i
mean
fridge
drinkability
is
alright
for
this
one
nothing
objectionable
id
certainly
drink
one
if
it
were
handed
to
me
but
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
ive
tasted
beers
of
this
style
ive
enjoyed
more
worth
trying
this
beer
is
a
lighter
shade
of
yellow
and
is
slightly
cloudy
there
is
a
small
head
the
smell
is
wheaty
and
a
little
of
the
abv
shows
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
wheat
and
the
abv
shos
here
as
well
but
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
smooth
this
helps
the
drinkability
a
fair
belgian
drinkable
fair
i
could
drink
this
again
sometime
this
one
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
drink
lightly
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
large
tulip
glass
it
pours
the
color
of
a
bright
goldenhoney
color
with
a
slight
surface
layer
of
white
eggshell
head
that
quickly
turns
to
only
a
slight
edge
layer
around
the
glass
body
is
slightly
hazy
as
i
hold
it
up
to
the
light
as
well
fairly
fruity
on
the
nose
with
a
large
bite
of
alcohol
that
hits
my
sinuses
a
slight
aroma
of
cloves
or
coriander
is
noted
along
with
a
slight
vanilla
and
orange
peel
aroma
that
is
fairly
pleasing
fairly
sweet
to
sip
lots
of
cloves
tasted
up
front
along
with
other
spices
maybe
coriander
if
i
am
correct
a
nice
balanced
maltiness
comes
out
as
well
all
while
i
taste
a
bit
of
orange
peel
or
other
citrus
fruits
body
is
quite
nice
and
balanced
between
a
slight
carbonation
leading
to
a
nice
fairly
crisp
body
in
which
the
alcohol
tends
to
be
quite
mild
really
the
finish
is
very
nice
and
it
doesnt
dry
out
as
much
as
anticipated
with
an
abv
of
over
7
this
one
is
not
going
to
be
an
easy
drinker
if
i
attempted
to
drink
a
sixer
but
this
makes
a
nice
slightly
warming
brew
especially
after
being
outside
shoveling
snow
and
ice
for
most
of
the
day
notes
this
is
a
really
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
pale
better
than
many
of
the
belgian
imports
ive
had
hats
off
to
north
coast
make
their
way
into
my
area
this
beer
would
be
very
drinkable
if
not
for
the
taste
simply
lacking
in
balance
i
imagine
some
conditioning
might
help
as
a
matter
of
preference
if
you
really
like
dry
or
farmstyle
yeasts
this
could
be
for
you
unfortunately
this
lacks
the
refinement
of
oldworld
belgians
light
drinkable
feel
with
an
appropriately
stinging
medium
carbonation
all
of
the
notes
in
the
aroma
come
through
in
the
flavor
and
its
all
very
balanced
nothing
groundbreaking
but
its
pleasant
and
a
great
american
version
of
a
good
belgian
style
some
musty
hops
dominate
the
aroma
it
somehow
smells
dusty
there
is
certainly
some
sweetness
too
and
a
hint
of
golden
raisin
the
raisin
is
refleted
in
the
flavor
to
a
greater
degree
than
in
the
smell
haps
are
significant
here
and
offer
a
considerable
bitterness
to
frame
the
taste
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
made
by
an
american
brewer
sometimes
the
style
is
a
little
off
when
its
made
here
but
this
one
does
well
recommended
12
oz
bottle
from
the
local
coop
poured
a
rich
and
hazy
orange
color
and
left
a
medium
twio
finger
head
and
nice
rings
of
lacing
as
it
slowly
settled
nose
is
of
yeast
flowers
malts
and
hops
with
banana
esters
palate
is
of
alcohol
and
flavor
is
sweet
and
light
hops
which
makes
it
really
clean
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
finish
is
great
with
a
lttle
bitterness
at
the
very
end
good
brew
and
ranks
right
up
there
with
imports
from
belgium
costing
far
more
including
north
coasts
own
brother
thelonious
at
6
35
for
a
four
pack
48
oz
it
is
a
good
buy
this
is
a
sipper
the
dryness
the
yeast
hops
profile
really
slow
me
down
this
isnt
my
style
though
but
just
an
average
example
of
it
drinkability
is
good
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
would
probly
limit
it
to
a
short
session
but
a
session
nonetheless
it
does
sit
very
easy
on
the
stomach
though
and
the
low
co2
helps
it
along
as
well
all
in
all
not
bad
for
a
belgian
golden
note
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
notes
im
neglecting
to
mention
all
the
typical
esters
in
detail
but
they
are
there
this
is
a
very
well
made
belgain
style
beer
indeed
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
i
havent
had
this
in
so
long
i
forgot
how
good
it
was
loses
carbonation
if
you
sip
too
long
like
i
do
this
offering
pours
a
foggy
orange
yeast
throughout
with
lemon
highlights
that
leaves
a
thin
spotchy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
wheat
lemon
grass
honey
sugar
cane
sweet
tropical
fruit
the
taste
is
malty
fruit
sugar
syrupy
on
the
palate
a
light
nudge
of
hops
which
sets
it
back
in
balance
but
this
is
a
true
belgian
golden
ale
with
a
light
alcohal
feel
on
the
palate
that
is
so
sweet
and
delicious
one
that
i
will
go
back
to
again
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
shame
it
was
practicall
uncarbonated
i
dont
know
if
there
was
a
bottling
problem
but
it
came
out
slightly
flatter
than
cask
ale
smelled
and
tased
of
apple
juice
it
wasa
bit
more
complex
than
just
juice
with
orange
liquer
and
spice
no
hint
of
alcohol
but
i
think
it
was
fermented
a
bit
warm
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
one
of
the
more
true
examples
of
the
style
here
stateside
that
ive
had
im
not
a
big
fan
of
north
coasts
six
pack
beer
but
ive
really
been
feeling
their
high
end
stuff
lately
overall
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
and
could
be
easily
substituted
for
a
white
wine
kudos
for
originality
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
very
carbonated
belgians
arent
my
favorite
but
i
have
had
other
examples
superior
to
this
particular
one
drinkability
a
nice
beer
but
the
strong
yeast
aromas
and
flavors
combined
with
the
metallic
aftertaste
i
experienced
keeps
me
from
rating
it
higher
after
sampling
this
and
brother
theloneous
another
belgianstyled
offering
from
north
coast
i
have
to
say
that
this
brewery
does
belgium
well
others
make
reference
to
duvel
but
i
dont
think
this
is
as
complex
or
lively
definitely
not
playing
at
that
same
exalted
level
nevertheless
a
delicious
beer
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
could
be
a
nice
session
beverage
cheers
drinkability
it
was
an
average
american
take
on
a
belgian
ale
that
can
be
easily
found
and
would
probably
make
a
nice
alternative
if
you
cant
find
any
real
belgian
ales
around
great
stuff
will
buy
again
d
there
is
something
dead
about
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
something
that
reminds
me
the
taste
of
cloth
drinkability
very
tasty
and
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
nice
flavor
poured
an
extremely
hazy
golden
with
a
halfinch
head
that
reduced
quickly
to
a
nice
white
ring
around
the
glass
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
huge
smells
of
yeast
white
grapes
funkiness
spiciness
very
complex
taste
is
more
of
the
same
fruitiness
white
grapes
tart
yeast
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
also
some
clove
in
the
finish
actually
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
this
beer
reminds
me
alot
of
a
saison
as
well
just
a
lot
thicker
mouthfeel
very
tingly
on
the
tongue
decently
drinkable
pretty
good
try
on
a
belgian
style
from
northcoast
d
pretty
decent
for
a
7
6
abv
it
drinks
like
half
its
weight
i
can
not
compare
this
to
duvel
mainly
bc
i
think
duvel
sucks
and
this
is
another
fine
drinkable
beer
by
north
coast
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
north
coast
and
plan
to
revisit
this
again
it
didnt
taste
like
it
was
completely
bad
or
over
oxidized
or
anything
but
maybe
this
bottle
was
derelict
is
some
wayi
hope
pranqster
is
good
sometimes
i
think
this
beer
is
only
decent
and
yet
other
times
i
thought
it
was
excellent
the
sample
i
am
drinking
right
now
is
merely
good
when
i
go
to
kansas
city
i
usually
purchase
a
fourpack
i
am
a
sucker
for
these
types
of
beers
however
now
that
i
can
purchase
unibroue
in
omaha
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
pranqster
anytime
soon
while
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
and
likeable
belgianstyle
ale
there
are
better
beers
that
have
a
similar
flavor
profile
regardless
north
coast
should
be
pleased
with
this
beer
worth
a
try
adam
d
very
drinkable
d
highly
drinkable
belgian
strong
paleone
of
the
better
american
belgians
ive
had
higher
abv
is
noticeable
in
the
chest
by
a
warming
sensation
warming
sensation
is
a
good
attribute
this
beer
holds
up
nicely
and
becomes
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
i
like
swirling
this
beer
around
to
unleash
more
and
more
of
the
depth
hats
off
to
north
coast
on
another
great
beer
true
to
style
and
dare
i
say
just
as
good
as
most
authentic
belgian
strong
pale
ales
that
ive
had
appearance
is
a
hazy
dark
yellow
head
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
yeasty
and
fruity
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
a
hefe
and
a
triple
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
and
excellent
not
cloying
slightly
fruity
some
banana
clove
and
good
belgian
yeast
would
say
it
leans
more
towards
a
triple
in
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
combination
of
rich
and
carbonated
drinkability
is
excellent
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
warm
day
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
definitely
recommend
it
the
smell
is
classic
belgian
fruity
esters
sweet
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
floral
hops
hit
the
nose
the
taste
is
great
its
on
the
sweet
side
and
tastes
a
bit
fruity
but
oh
so
much
like
a
belgian
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
temptingly
good
overall
while
this
stuff
certainly
doesnt
compare
to
ales
like
duvel
or
la
fin
du
monde
it
is
a
very
good
stab
at
the
style
like
most
products
from
north
coast
you
can
tell
that
this
was
brewed
with
skill
and
caring
recommended
pours
a
foggy
golden
cider
color
with
high
lights
around
the
base
and
edges
i
cant
see
through
this
one
at
all
the
head
is
non
aggressive
and
dissipates
fast
smells
of
mild
citrus
moderate
to
medium
spice
palate
no
real
alcohol
sents
mainly
the
belgian
yeasts
and
hops
the
taste
is
pleasant
not
aggressive
or
demanding
decently
balanced
the
effervescence
is
a
little
lacking
this
is
not
by
any
means
my
favorite
belgian
style
golden
ale
let
alone
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
its
decent
i
keep
thinking
of
october
for
some
reason
when
drinking
this
any
how
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
not
because
it
is
bad
by
any
means
but
there
are
just
so
many
more
golden
ales
i
like
better
the
beer
poured
with
a
deep
lightly
hazed
yellow
gold
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
which
disapointed
me
fruity
nose
and
lightly
fruity
with
surprisingly
hopped
and
dry
finish
a
drinkable
but
solid
belgian
style
strong
pale
one
i
would
go
for
again
if
the
price
is
right
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
it
was
over
i
didnt
say
i
gotta
get
me
some
more
of
that
if
you
see
it
try
it
it
may
be
up
your
alley
it
really
isnt
up
mine
12oz
bottle
into
a
chalice
glass
pours
out
a
mostlyclear
amber
gold
color
with
a
small
airy
head
that
fades
quickly
very
nice
aroma
highly
fruity
citrusy
with
a
corianderspiciness
and
soft
undercurrent
of
vanilla
spices
come
out
front
right
away
with
moderate
bitterness
and
earthy
hop
flavor
along
with
a
strong
vanillaish
lemonzest
note
a
light
touch
of
pale
malt
sweetness
and
a
finish
that
warms
and
lingers
creamy
mouthfeel
moderate
body
well
refined
well
brewed
almost
quaffable
excepting
the
strength
certainly
worth
trying
a
drinkable
interesting
belgian
pale
d
good
stuff
fits
the
style
to
a
t
except
for
lack
of
spiciness
in
taste
overall
i
dont
particularly
like
this
beer
i
cant
exactly
place
it
but
i
doubt
i
will
buy
it
again
d
im
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
simply
think
its
ok
d
i
expected
more
from
north
coast
but
am
willing
to
give
this
one
another
chance
as
i
know
its
a
tough
one
i
poured
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
and
noticed
the
sediment
is
more
murky
than
the
normal
chunks
left
in
a
belgian
looked
almost
milky
this
is
a
great
brewery
struggling
with
a
difficult
style
and
i
look
forward
to
where
this
leads
i
definitely
want
to
keep
a
few
of
these
nearby
one
of
the
best
aromas
i
have
found
in
a
beer
next
time
ill
let
it
warm
up
a
little
longer
a
low
cost
introduction
to
the
style
tha
is
worth
trying
overall
sok
but
i
think
there
are
some
better
the
flavor
is
fruity
carmelized
malt
not
to
heavy
refreshing
d
had
good
and
bad
points
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
smell
but
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
not
up
to
par
good
stuff
and
im
more
and
more
impressed
with
north
coast
dont
know
how
long
this
was
sitting
by
the
time
the
waitress
brought
this
to
me
but
there
was
zero
head
and
zero
lacing
color
was
yellow
aroma
was
sweet
with
cloves
and
a
bit
hoppy
with
not
much
malt
fruity
taste
once
it
warmed
up
not
much
carbonation
either
even
though
i
think
i
remember
that
this
usually
has
more
of
a
bite
to
it
pours
a
semitranslucent
light
orange
peel
almost
looks
like
a
sparkling
blush
wine
the
bubbling
was
dispersed
and
slow
the
aroma
is
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
toasty
malt
mix
the
flavor
was
a
little
minus
on
the
umph
of
flavor
a
little
flat
in
the
sweet
carbonated
malts
department
a
little
bready
and
aniselike
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
i
like
the
style
and
im
really
into
north
coast
right
now
would
definately
have
this
one
again
and
again
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
good
full
and
stable
head
smell
is
very
floral
with
some
banana
and
biscuit
notes
there
is
also
some
band
aid
smell
that
fades
and
the
head
falls
as
the
floral
aroma
clears
a
lemon
sent
also
develops
the
taste
is
sweet
and
lemony
with
a
hint
of
sourness
as
the
beer
fades
similar
to
what
one
would
expect
with
a
wit
there
is
also
a
distinct
alcohol
note
as
the
tartness
fades
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
complex
beer
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
the
aroma
was
a
little
off
cloudy
dark
yellow
with
a
slowly
dissipating
white
head
leaving
spotty
lacing
smell
is
sour
has
overripe
fruit
banana
lemon
and
a
yeasty
aroma
to
it
taste
is
of
bananas
lemons
and
apples
definately
some
clove
as
well
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
had
an
average
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
a
solid
brew
to
have
once
in
a
while
definitely
worth
picking
up
big
clove
aroma
tastes
are
lightly
fruity
with
banana
apple
orange
peel
with
a
hefty
dose
of
cloves
yeast
and
coriander
to
spice
things
up
moderate
mouthfeel
a
bit
chalky
actually
however
it
slides
down
the
hatch
with
little
to
no
effort
another
solid
americanbrewed
belgian
not
fantastic
but
a
good
effort
nonetheless
my
rating
is
high
in
large
part
because
i
really
like
the
style
but
there
are
many
other
strong
goldens
i
would
take
before
this
good
beer
but
drinkability
suffers
a
little
bit
the
finish
is
almost
unbearable
but
the
taste
is
very
good
this
means
that
youll
either
find
yourself
going
through
this
fairly
high
proof
beer
either
too
quickly
or
very
slowly
unless
of
course
a
parched
mouth
is
one
of
your
things
quite
interesting
and
very
refreshing
with
good
body
well
worth
the
try
sometimes
astounding
is
more
than
you
need
and
thats
when
this
beer
would
come
up
big
solidly
good
fundamentally
tasty
and
quite
enjoyable
its
got
a
cheerful
backbone
and
a
sassy
structure
the
abv
makes
an
impression
but
even
so
it
goes
down
smooth
and
pleasurably
it
comes
across
and
dependable
and
in
a
world
gone
crazy
thats
a
good
thing
or
something
like
that
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
with
carbonation
that
doesnt
have
a
bite
to
it
overall
i
vwas
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
definitely
hope
to
sample
more
of
north
coasts
beers
theyve
just
started
distributing
in
boston
so
i
cant
wait
overall
another
solid
offering
from
north
coast
that
rivals
any
belgian
style
pale
ale
whether
it
be
from
the
greatest
beer
country
or
from
the
states
really
well
done
and
true
to
the
style
all
the
way
around
pick
some
up
and
enjoy
overall
not
bad
but
a
definite
oversea
cousin
of
a
belgian
strong
with
hints
of
a
true
belgian
appearance
is
a
cloudy
appricot
and
pranqster
has
a
strong
aroma
flavor
manages
to
capture
some
of
the
belgium
charactoristics
but
again
it
lacks
complexity
and
again
this
may
be
desirable
to
some
considering
this
is
on
the
low
end
of
the
belgian
strong
ales
mediumlight
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
with
a
good
breadiness
with
some
caramel
to
go
along
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
some
other
belgian
styles
have
taste
is
good
the
fruit
on
the
nose
is
present
some
melon
i
would
say
it
was
a
regular
wheat
beer
with
about

they

the

right

a

of
these
wont
knock

beers
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
remotly
likes
belgin
style
ales
and
the
price
cannot
be
beat
i
am
looking
foward
to
trying
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
some
time
it
would
be
worth
the
drive
delicious
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
itll
be
difficult
to
find
equally
good
belgians
at
pranqsters
price
aggressive
yeast
in
terms
of
aroma
and
taste
for
a
belgium
but
otherwise
true

its
style
an
interesting
and
worthwhile
addition
to
its
style
coriander

the
aftertaste
is

with

lingering
with
the
balance
of
carbonation
that
disappears
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
color
and
has
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
has
a
nice
slow
fine
carbonation
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
fruity
and
overall
very
alluring
the
taste
is
every
bit
as
yeasty
as
the
smell
and
there
is
a
explosion
of
tart
fruitiness
that
covers
up
the
alcohol
well
but
i
did
detect
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
a
damn
fine
belgian
ale
after
so
long
lets
see
what
we
get
again
love
the
label
only
odd
thing
being
the
dude
on
the
far
right
doesnt
fit
wonder
if
that
is
the
brewer
anyways
cloudy

golden

head
moves
fast
but
keeps
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
smell
is
very
fruity
sweet
but
rotten
mostly
apples
hides
the
abv
from
the
nose
so
gotta
give
it
a
taste
and
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
exactly
mouth
gets
full
splash
of
sweet
and
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
apple
jolly
rancher
no
screams
and
yells
about
this
beer
but
no
gripes
either
is
sweet
enough
to
go
with
a
chili
dog
as
long
as
its
not
hot
chili
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
nice
fruit
character
the
flavor
is
very
spicy
some
fruit
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
but
the
spicy
character
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
and
the
mouthfeel
another
solid
north
coast
offering
beer
is
good
happy
belgian
pale
beering
this
appears
a
cloudy
deep
orange
with
a
tall
inch
high
white
head
as
the
head
quickly
goes
down
scatterings
of
lace
are
left
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
hints
of
doughy
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
mixed
with
a
good
bit
of
spice
not
much
alcohol
detectable
in
this
one
it
ends
with
a
spicy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
with
about
a
medium
body
the
is
good
stuff
that
is
definitely
drinkable
and
i
will
be
having
it
again
finally
took
the
plunge
and
brought
home
a
4
pack
today
having
passed
over
this
brew
1
time
too
many
as
i
was
pouring
i
had
my
mind
on
other
things
therefore
the
yeast
ended
up
straight
into
the
tulip
glass
along
with
a
bright
golden
orange
elixir
which
was
guarded
by
a
2
finger
white
foam
head
the
haziness
brought
on
by
the
addition
of
the
yeast
doesnt
bother
me
and
i
seem
to
enjoy
my
belgian
pales
in
this
manner
aroma
was
nice
and
spicy
notes
of
bananna
and
clove
dominate
the
nose
with
the
clove
slightly
edging
out
the
bananna
taste
has
a
lot
of
that
bananna
flavor
the
strongest
that
ive
ever
experienced
outside
of
a
hefe
finish
is
slightly
yeasty
thanks
to
me
but
the
flavor
is
not
offputting
balance
is
nice
it
also
possess
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
north
coast
which
ill
be
sure
to
enjoy
more
often
i
love
this
beer
and
would
really
like
to
ty
it
on
tap
i
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
this
weekend
but
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
it
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
my
best
beers
i
bought
a
5
gal
keg
as
the
label
says
golden
ale
orange
in
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
stays
long
smells
of
citrus
spice
sweet
and
yeast
great
mouth
feel
warm
frothy
you
also
get
a
yeast
in
the
taste
but
not
a
bad
one
at
7
6
on
the
label
you
can
only
drink
a
few
glasses
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
belgian
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
spicy
acidic
and
slightly
funky
taste
is
of
spice
sweet
malt
with
hops
there
for
bitterness
only
alcohol
is
present
not
the
smoothest
for
its
abv
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
bubbly
head
nice
and
lasting
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
lace
a
peppery
spicy
aroma
dominates
the
smell
phenolic
and
yeasty
with
a
nice
background
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
mix
of
fleeting
maltiness
with
lots
of
spice
rather
full
mouthfeel

hops
are
also
not
very

overall
a
golden

great
beer
ive
had
the
old
rasputin
and
red
seal
previously
and
enjoyed
them
both
so
i
have
high
hopes
for
this
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
with
a
very
cloudy
orange
color
nice
one
inch
head
as
well
smells
spicy
and
fruity
and
tastes
the
same
wow
quite
an
interesting
flavor
the
peppery
taste
comes
through
as
well
as
a
fruity
citrus
flavor
this
is
a
new
taste
for
me
and
i
am
enjoying
it
the
7
6
abv
can
be
felt
after
about
half
the
bottle
nice
and
warming
this
would
be
good
on
a
cold
night
i
like
this
belgian
ale
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
kudos
to
north
coast
brewing
co
for
another
great
beer
received
a
4
pack
nicely
aged
i
might
add
from
a
friend
poured
into
the
snifter
well
and
has
a
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
nice
light
head
a
bit
hazy
almost
like
a
heffie
type
beer
general
aroma
was
nice
and
fruity
i
was
excited
to
sit
and
watch
the
thunder
storm
roll
in
whilst
enjoying
this
beer
drank
it
slightly
chilled
but
not
cold
to
savour
the
true
flavours
which
were
nice
and
robust
the
taste
is
very
good
and
not
overpowering
like
some
in
its
style
class
but
still
enough
flavour
so
you
take
notice
definately
becoming
a
favourite
of
mine
will
need
to
get
my
hands
on
more
for
sure
not
a
food
beer
but
better
after
dinner
sitting
with
friends
on
the
porch
drinkability
not
a
session
brew
for
sure
but
a
great
food
beer
or
after
dinner
sipper
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
as
complex
or
fruity
as
other
belgians
pranqster
with
a
capital
q
is
an
honest
replication
oxymoron
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
it
is
composed
of
clean
lines
with
a
spry
animated
body
and
a
punctual
bitter
finish
this
mendocino
classic
is
ironically
a
better
belgian
than
many
belgian
belgians
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
belgianstyle
golden
ales
ive
ever
had
nearly
flawless
all
the
elements
to
enjoy
in
a
quality
brewdepth
of
flavor
and
aroma
and
infinite
drinkability
i
will
run
out
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
delicious
elixir
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
at
the
start
with
a
creamy
smooth
finish
with
a
bit
of
crispness
the
yeast
and
spices
lasted
shortly
on
the
tongue
nicely
drinkable
and
a
nicely
enjoyable
beligian
ale
for
those
who
do
like
a
lot
of
spice
in
a
belgian
this
is
the
one
to
try
notes
very
good
beer
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
newcomers
to
the
world
of
belgian
spicing
while
i
may
not
have
had
this
under
optimal
conditions
im
not
positive
it
wasnt
sitting
in
a
toohot
car
before
being
delivered
to
me
i
was
not
entirely
impressed
the
rolling
bubbles
seemed
to
suggest
it
was
too
carbonated
it
helped
cloud
the
beer
on
opening
and
lent
a
message
that
i
remember
from
the
one
brew
i
did
that
seemed
to
have
been
infected
with
a
wild
yeast
the
flavor
pitched
too
much
toward
fruit
in
this
case
it
wasnt
entirely
unpleasant
more
like
banana
but
that
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
hints
i
was
expecting
maybe
a
little
more
malt
in
my
yeastand
perhaps
more
in
the
scent
as
well
hops
were
almost
absent
the
best
part
was
definitely
the
mouth
where
even
the
volume
of
carbonation
didnt
seem
harshas
it
often
can
when
there
is
too
much
just
slightly
sticky
with
sweetness
and
full
for
7abv
it
was
gentle
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
quality
was
there
if
not
the
flavor
i
prefer
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
bring
this
home
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
ng
fairly
small
head
but
not
a
flat
beer
looks
like
peach
juice
could
barely
detect
a
mellow
fruity
smell
has
refreshing
clean
spicy
lemony
taste
nice
yeasty
aftertaste
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
especially
with
the
lower
abv
this
style
that
is
still
didnt
blow
me
away
but
a
good
example
of
a
strong
belgian
i
will
certainly
buy
one
again
since
the
bodega
on
the
streetcorner
carries
them
for
some
miraculous
reason
this
is
a
beautifully
executed
belgian
ale
reminescent
of
the
great
trappist
ales
of
belgium
i
find
its
assertiveness
and
complexity
remind
me
of
young
examples
of
westmalle
tripel
i
think
this
will
age
beautifully
a
bit
too
tart
to
begin
followed
by
that
nice
yeasty
breadlike
quality
that
was
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
and
the
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
though
pleasant
beckoning
you
to
take
another
sip
this
is
a
belgian
styled
beer
that
is
ment
to
truly
express
the
impact
belgian
yeast
has
on
a
beer
all
belgian
beers
are
characterized
by
the
indivdiual
flavors
imparted
by
the
yeasts
each
brewery
uses
north
coast
brews
a
fresh
domestic
beer
that
dosent
comprimise
the
extreme
yeast
flavors
of
belgium
sweet
flavors
on
the
initial
taste
segue
into
a
spicy
citrus
flavor
finishing
with
a
clean
but
alcoholic
presence
lower
than
true
belgian
carbonation
leaves
this
beer
with
less
of
a
head
than
should
be
expected
from
the
style
and
there
is
no
belgian
lace
to
be
seen
ive
seen
this
beer
at
the
local
beer
store
a
few
times
but
passed
finally
picked
one
up
the
name
of
the
beer
is
clever
love
the
label
pours
a
foggy
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
funky
almost
smells
of
game
or
wild
animal
taste
is
very
strong
yet
the
spice
and
strongness
didnt
do
well
on
my
palette
feels
dense
but
lacking
pizazz
in
the
mouth
couldnt
drink
this
again
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
apricot
tinted
gold
the
head
was
white
carbonated
and
did
not
leave
much
lace
only
in
sticky
spots
the
aroma
was
sweet
sugar
malt
the
taste
carried
some
sweet
malt
along
while
blended
with
a
nice
hop
balance
an
easy
alcohol
warmth
is
felt
a
spicy
favor
to
the
taste
is
noticed
with
hints
of
citric
coriander
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
to
be
had
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
ive
have
better
luck
tasting
other
beers
from
this
brewery
this
beer
has
some
tasty
qualities
but
isnt
busting
with
flavor
as
many
in
style
can
be
this
boarders
on
being
an
easy
drinker
which
for
style
seems
odd
this
is
a
very
accessible
and
nicely
done
interpretation
of
this
classic
style
id
rate
this
belgian
style
ale
as
ok
but
im
not
flying
banners
from
the
ramparts
the
beer
pours
a
hazycloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
really
fruity
banana
type
scent
that
is
very
pleasant
along
with
a
pale
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
is
rich
with
fruitiness
and
spice
it
has
belgian
yeast
flavor
on
top
of
a
pale
malt
base
it
goes
down
easy
but
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
it
has
tremendous
aroma
and
taste
a
good
sessions
brew
this
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
tons
of
sediment
floating
in
the
glass
smell
is
really
nice
belgian
yeast
dominates
the
nose
along
with
a
slight
notes
of
various
spices
taste
is
malty
sweet
upfront
fruity
sweet
in
the
middle
combined
with
a
wheaty
precense
and
very
yeasty
with
spices
in
the
finish
very
dry
finish
the
fruit
flavors
are
akin
to
banana
and
apricot
which
is
an
interesting
combination
quite
thick
yet
smooth
a
nice
americanmade
belgian
pours
the
general
cloudy
yellow
one
would
expect
from
most
belgians
except
that
there
were
small
particlesflakes
floating
throughout
the
brew
easily
drinkable
considering
its
clean
almost
oceanlike
taste
suprisingly
this
belgian
packs
some
bite
which
is
noted
in
the
fruitfilled
hoppiness
im
not
sure
if
that
is
even
a
word
of
the
mouthfeel
worth
trying
especially
if
your
looking
for
something
different
from
the
standard
sarah
pours
a
hazy
peachamber
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
aroma
consists
of
spicy
yeast
malt
alcohol
and
tropical
fruit
very
appealing
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
nicely
carbonated
flavors
of
mango
and
malt
upfront
fruity
sweetness
carries
through
the
middle
peppery
yeast
and
corriander
are
noticed
toward
the
back
alcoholic
vapors
linger
long
after
the
finish
slight
warming
sensation
as
it
glides
down
the
throat
nicely
done
i
have
never
been
a
fan
od
belgian
style
beers
this
is
the
first
the
pour
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
strictly
fruity
apples
was
the
dominant
smell
the
taste
was
like
a
bitter
sweet
aplle
cider
with
just
a
hint
of
banana
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
hands
down
the
best
that
i
have
had
in
its
style
tatse
is
very
much
like
a
belgian
pale
clove
coriander
and
nutmeg
provide
a
spice
array
to
carry
the
fruit
complexities
comfortably
mango
peach
and
apricot
offer
the
fruit
presence
and
there
is
a
hint
of
bubblegum
or
honey
in
the
background
very
well
done
overall
drinkability
exotic
taste
but
oh
so
sweet
didnt
want
another
the
pour
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
white
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
in
it
smell
is
very
fruity
almost
too
rich
and
round
which
leads
me
to
believe
the
brew
will
be
overly
estery
wrong
the
taste
is
a
slightly
subdued
sour
fruit
taste
typical
of
tripels
without
the
carameled
unfermentable
sugars
leading
to
a
dry
finish
but
and
a
slightly
harsh
alcohol
aftertaste
that
burns
the
throat
not
altogether
enjoyable
particularly
for
something
with
this
moderate
amount
of
abv
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
light
and
just
soso
an
okay
offering
good
not
great
but
ultimately
soso
on
tap
at
macgregors
this
belgian
was
true
to
its
heritagespicy
it
poured
a
mysterious
musty
copper
and
the
thin
offwhite
head
left
only
a
tentative
spotty
lacing
the
pranqster
smelled
of
very
sweet
hay
or
sweat
and
yet
it
tasted
distinctly
of
spiced
cherries
with
lots
of
honey
alcohol
esters
and
dare
i
say
it
a
rather
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
of
medium
body
with
only
a
touch
of
noticable
carbonation
pretty
decent
interpretation
of
a
belgian
pale
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
sadly
there
was
little
lacing
to
be
seen
smell
was
sweet
with
scents
of
orange
peel
and
musty
yeast
tasted
of
sweet
honey
and
standard
belgian
notes
of
slight
spiceyness
malts
and
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
good
west
coast
interpretation
of
the
style
had
this
at
macgregors
as
always
it
was
served
properly
cool
and
in
a
chalice
came
a
cloudy
dark
tea
color
with
a
nice
thin
coating
of
foamy
head
the
smell
was
very
nice
with
yeast
present
and
a
certain
saltiness
the
smell
was
rounded
out
by
some
cherry
and
pineapple
reminded
me
of
a
much
lighter
three
philosophers
taste
again
was
cherrys
and
a
bit
of
saltiness
the
malts
made
their
presence
also
the
taste
made
a
very
pleasant
balance
felt
very
appropriate
in
the
mouth
being
very
smooth
and
having
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
well
made
american
take
on
a
belgian
ale
and
that
means
that
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
costs
almost
the
same
as
a
750ml
chimay
the
cloudy
golden
haze
and
the
fresh
yeasty
nose
are
present
and
so
is
a
well
constructed
main
body
this
is
not
the
best
belgian
style
beer
in
north
america
unibroue
ommegang
new
belgium
but
i
would
pick
up
a
6
pack
to
satisfy
that
belgium
craving
without
breaking
the
bank
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
crisp
white
head
which
slowly
morphs
into
a
tiny
bubble

and
leaves
nice
lacing

a
nicely
turned
out
american
take
on
the
style
beef
notes
this
one
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
it
again
its
just
not
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
im
sure
some
people
like
it
a
lot
more
than
me
its
definitely
worth
the
try
and
something
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
it
another
great
beer
from
north
coast
tastes
real
good
easy
to
sip
but
id
rather
have
two
and
get
warmed
up
great
job
emulating
the
stylebravo
this
beer
when
held
up
to
the
light
appeared
to
have
a
mix
of
colors
goldbrownyellow
and
hints
of
red
on
the
edges
it
was
fairly
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
created
was
off
white
colored
and
sticky
full
and
thick
in
nature
it
seemed
to
last
fairly
well
until
it
finally
fell
there
was
lace
present
sticky
and
somewhat
complex
and
as
it
was
drank
the
lace
dried
to
a
film
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
some
spices
lots
of
belgian
yeast
malt
and
touches
of
sweet
fruits
the
tastes
were
full
of
spices
sweet
malts
yeasts
earthy
notes
of
alcohol
pepper
then
it
finished
on
the
sweet
side
the
body
was
medium
this
beer
was
very
warming
and
sneaky
i
rather
enjoyed
the
different
flavor
combinations
and
the
spiciness
of
the
beer
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
beer
to
sit
around
and
drink
slowly
a
very
pleasant
drinkable
beer
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
nice
lingering
tartness
great
drinkability
despite
the
strong
spiciness
and
high
abv
tatses
nice
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
coriander
and
sweet
malt
almost
a
little
too
syrypy
at
the
end
but
darn
nice
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
of
the
medium
body
variety
and
it
is
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink

the
forces
of
nature
prevail

i
would
gladly

comparable
to
some
of
unibroues

of

lemon
this
is
one
really
good
beer
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
though
overall
this
is
one
high
quality
product
if
only
it
was
sold
in
something
larger
than
a
4pk
locally
nice

and
clor
but
the
floaty
yeast
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off

smell
that
hit
the
nose
quite
nicely
javent
had
too
many
belgian
styles
so
i
will
have
to
try
others
to
be
truly
objective
taste
was
beautifully
rounded
with
an
almost
wine
like
quality
an

that
ended
in

kick
on

for
its

very
drinkable
offering
a

indeedi
liked
this
one
from
the
moment
i
tasted
it
and
i
definitely
would
enjoy
having
this
one
again
and
againit
poured
a
small
sized

with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
fully
dissipated
the

was
carbonated

the

was

light
bodied
there
was
a
fair

with

overall
a
very
nice

golden
ale
to
finish
the
night
with
compared
against
the
price
of
belgiums
from
the
homeland
at

than
2
this
is
well
worth
the
money
more
of
these

been
this

may
just
take
the
cake
not

alcholic

this

contains

and
the
fruity
taste
mingled
well
the
yeast
tones
i
like
bells
sparkling
a

better
but
all
in
all
a
good
brew
lots
of
yeast
thats
what
hit
me
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
flavor
almost
more
like
a
wit
than
a
strong
pale
but
very
tasty
nonetheless
nice
sharp
carbonation
sweet
as
one
would
expect
the
play
between
the
spice
and
yeast
flavors
was
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
might
hope
but
this
is
certainly
a
fine
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
to
orange
color
depending
on
the
light
full
white
head
with
staying
power
carbonation
was
right
on

extra
good
full

flavor
with
spicy

citrus
undertones
and
crisp

medium

and
full
cloudy

flavors
make
this
a
winner
very
easy
to
drink
right
up
there
with
the
golden
monkey
imo
and
much
better
than
the
orval
duvel
and
other
overly
carbonated
ales
a
good
example
of
the
style
obviously
a
well
made
and
complex
brew
but
i
am
going
to
have
to
acquire
a
taste
for
it
not
my
favorite
as
of
now
its
a
nice
orangishgold
with
a
pretty
solid
white
head
that
fades
quickly
small
pieces
of
yeast
float
throughout
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
are
spicy
with
hints
of

and
subtle

was

to
find
that
i
liked
this
better
than
most
belgian
brews
a
pleasant
surprise
north
coast
version
of
a
belgian
would
be
a
good
place
for
a
novice
drinker
of
belgians
to
start
deep
golden
color
is
very
pleasing
on
the
eye
and
the
aroma
is
there
though
faint
of
course
it
doesnt
have
the
alcohol
kick
that
your
normal
belgians
have
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
cheers
pours
a
cloudy
apple
juice
color
with
a
smaller

i
was

i
expected
more
head

the
style
nose

dominated
by
the
spicy
yeast

some
estery
hints
underneath
on
the
tongue
the
change
dominance
with
an
apricotlike
esteriness
trying
unsuccessfully
to
hide
the
spiciness
the
pranqster
has
more
esters
than
most
of
the
belgians
pales
ive
had
but
the
spiciness
and
flavor
isnt
as
subtle
as
la
chouffe
leaves
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
bad
though
okay
this
beer
poured
out
a
golden
color
white
head
that
didnt
hold
the
beer
was
cloudy
with
evident
sediment
floating
in
it
a
citrus
and
spice
smell
with
some
elements
which
are
probably
yeast
the
taste
of
it
definately
had
some
citrus
elements
the
overall
taste
is
pretty
good

a
strong

it

frolic

anything

of
slight

orange
slight

respectful
to
the

no
comparison
to
a
real
belgian
pale
or
a
beer
of
unibroue
quality
golden
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
around
could
be
due
to
the
fact
it
was
stored
on
its
side
in
the

aroma
can
be
described
as
a
light
hefeweizen
one
slight
banana

slight

sandwiched
between
wheat
maltiness
and
refreshing

easy
going
wouldnt
guess
it
was
7
12
av
as
my
bottle
indicates
this
is
a
little
big
for
the
style
but
i
do
like
it
deep
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
head
that
ran
away
too
quickly
for
my
tastes
the
smell
is
very
yeasty
big
yeast
taste
with
some
complex
fruity
sweetness
slightly
efervescent
across
the
palate
pretty
clean
not
highly
drinkable
although
it
isnt
full
bodied
it
definitely
has
a
little
bit
of
an
impact
not
quite
letting
you
put
away
too
many
as
a
belgianstyle
strong
golden
ale
pranqster
compares
favorably
with
huyghes
delirium

or

lucifer
a
hazy
golden
color
with
only
moderate
carbonation
my
latest
sample
did
not
have
the
massive
head
of
duvel
the
yeasty
flavor
was
dominant
and
almost
overwhelmed
the
fruitiness
that
was
first
experienced
in
the
nose
mediumtoheavy

and
according
to
the
label
7

abv
ive
got
to
admit
though
that
im
a
duvel
guy
at
heart
and
i
dont
like
the
comparisons
to
duvel
this
beer
is
so
different
from
duvel
that
it
almost
deserves
its
own
style
or
maybe
duvel
is
so
unique
that
it
is
a
style
unto
itself
pours
to
a
thick
white
head
on

of
a
darker
shade
of
gold

the
style
thick
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
buttery
yeasty
scent
as
well
and
faint
notes
of

citrus

the
taste

heavy
on
the

with
a
strong
belgian
yeast
character
finished
by
a
hoppy
citrus
note
crisp

very
high

be

to

no
more
than

of
the
12oz
before

it

excellent
beer
notes
for
a

ale
this
kicks
the
dregs
out
of
duvel
more
character

than
their
exports
could
ever
dream
of
so
if
you
like

you
will
be
in

no

always
avoid

very

bottle
it
says
on
the
label
the
beer
develops
for
5
years
mine
was
pretty
funky
smelling
and
tasting
inrteresting
but
not
great
overall
a
really
good
beer
if
i
come
across
this
again
i
will
definitely
drink
it
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
beer
had
a
weird
after
taste
i
wasnt
ready
for
the
floral
spice
taste
at
first
but
as
a
got
to
the
end
of
my
pint
i
started
to
enjoy
it
perfect
for
when
i
want
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
and
am
in
bit
of
a
funky
mood
just
enough
floral
spice
to
make
it
interesting
prost
awesome
flavors
nice
evening
beer
ok
if
you
like
cloves
not
my
favorite
belgian
overall
what
a
fine
beer
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
this
one
too
often
but
ill
take
every
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
i
can
this
was
a
great
beer
ever
changing
beer
it
seems
i
will
keep
buying
it
because
of
that
i
like
it
when
it
has
more
fruitiness
and
a
slight
more
tartness
this
version
wasnt
quite
there
this
time
i
pair
it
with
almost
anything
a
nice
butter
poached
lobster
tail
with
a
saffron
rissoto
would
be
excellent
i
give
it

very
bitter

almost

one
fresh
hoping
with

this
gets
better
my
personal
favorite
from
the

portfolio
its
always
a

comes

the

with

notes
plus
hints
of
tangerine
and

texture
has
firm
body
and
plenty
of
fizz
waltz
with
this
matilda
it
tasted
really
good
would
drink
again
zesty
yeasty
but
well
balanced
another
amazing
beer
from
goose
island
this
is
my
sip
for
the
evening
while
watching
world
junior
hockey
and
it
is
fitting
chicago
is
a
great
sports
city
and
this
beer
brings
a
lovely
international
character
the
orangegold
color
steady
carbonation
and
lively
mouthfeel
are
are
wonderful
combination
matilda
has
an
alluring
scent
yeasty
citrus
that
pulls
you
in
the
breadth
of
the
flavors
are
difficult
to
describe
and
the
final
product
is
truly
wonderful
from
packaging
to
pour
to
finish
this
is
a
special
occasion
beer
amazing
smell
taste
and
body
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
i
got
lots
of
bubblegum
and
strawberry
on
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
was
kind
of
over
powering
i
am
surprised
that
this
beer
clocks
in
at
7
its
pretty
light
in
body
the
initial
sip
was
the
only
sip
where
i
got
more
of
the
belgium
yeast
flavors
and
candy
sugar
sweetness
overall
an
outstanding
bspa
very
smooth
and
showcases
the
belgian
yeast
character
quite
nicely
the
complexity
of
the
citrusyeastmalthop
qualities
make
this
a
fine
beer
if
i
am
able
to
save
one
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cellar
a
few
years
great
lighter
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
fast
but
very
balanced
none
the
less
floral
nose
you
can
smell
the
yeasts
taste
is
dominated
by
alcohol
and
im
searching
the
brettanomyces
not
bad
but
i
need
to
try
one
with
a
couple
of
months
of
aging
final
grade

an
a
goose
islands
matilda
is
an
interesting
strong
belgian
pale
ale
but
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
compare
with
the
real
titans
of
this
style
and
having
had
two
bottles
of
this
from
different
vintages
i
feel
pretty
comfortable
stating
that
the
brettanomyces
provides
a
unique
background
tartness
and
overall
i
must
say
that
i
do
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
still
no
duvel
or
don
de
dieu
pretty
good
stuff
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
ill
be
drinking
this
again
at
some
point

with
a
touch
of
tartness
semidry
finish

the
brett
really
showed
up
on
the
aroma
here
and
continued
to
add
a
nice
complex
tropical
floral
character
along
with
some
background
yeasty
barnyard
funk
i
thought
it
worked
really
well
deliciously
drinkable
has
acquired
some
heftier
brett
flavours
and
a
thick
mouthfeel
will
look
to
see
what
more
age
does
to
this
lovely
beer
i
just
recently
found
out
about
the
goose
island
sisters
and
after
having
this
one
im
elated
to
try
the
rest
the
taste
was
crisp
fruitful
and
the
dry
finish
was
what
made
this
so
memorable
simply
amazing
nothing
quite
like
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
i
must
have
enjoyed
this
more
before
this
glass
was
fine
the
carbonation
not
as
absent
as
it
looked
initially
however
there
was
nothing
in
this
to
excite
me
a
wellmade
decent
beer
though
interesting
how
much
this
beer
attenuated
funky
since
the
beginning
with
its
complexity
getting
revealed
in
little
by
little
liked
the
fact
that
just
not
focus
on
tartness
hops
are
decently
present
it
has
a
balance
that
is
hard
to
see
in
the
style
at
least
looking
with
modern
eyes
excellent
just
had
my
1e
and
2e
matilda
at
the
hyatt
in
chicago
great
taste
nice
after
taste
needed
to
convince
the
barman
to
serve
it
somewhat
warmer
5
degrees
celsius
is
too
cold
for
this
beer
but
pour
is
in
a
cognac
glas
and
wait
some
time
and
magic
happens
o
4
better
than
i
remember
it
drinks
so
smoothly
and
easily
i
might
have
to
buy
this
more
than
once
every
5
years
best
brett
beer
ive
had
as
im
usually
not
a
fan
pours
an
autumn
orange
color
with
a
short
off
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
few
minutes
before
evaporating
smells
of
wheat
yeast
barley
sandalwood
citrus
peels
has
a
very
mild
dry
woody
taste
very
mellow
with
a
hint
on
the
sweet
side
its
medium
bodied
with
ample
amounts
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
better
still
i
got
this
for
peanuts
at
costco
further
raising
my
adoration
of
this
beer
overflowed
like
a
beast
when
i
cracked
the
top
on
this
2013
vintage
poured
a
golden
amber
dazzling
in
the
light
with
a
finger
of
head
that
was
slow
to
dissipate
great
visible
carbonation
this
had
a
big
bright
nose
with
lots
of
yeasty
funk
some
alcohol
clovespice
and
a
hint
of
breadiness
nice
and
complex
changed
with
time
this
was
such
a
nice
balanced
sipper
funk
was
a
lot
more
mellow
on
the
palate
than
the
nose
heartybready
notes
and
some
clean
bitterness
medium
bodied
clean
and
clear
presentation
and
the
notes
that
did
linger
were
pleasant
ones
i
know
that
this
is
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
for
all
of
those
breweries
advertising
belgian
ipa
this
is
what
you
should
be
chasing
in
my
opinion
pretty
damn
impressed
with
this

750ml

wont
pick
up

is
a
better

an
initially
unassuming

rather
minimal

although
the
latter
does
develop
over
time
fairly
smooth
drinkable
low

moderate

moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry

provides
an
interesting
comparison
to
its
stablemate
sofie
more
dry

tannic
less

stronger
and
perhaps
more
rustic
excellent
work
although
i
may
swing
toward
the
slightly
sweeter
hazy
amber
with
some
suspended
sediment
and
a
small
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
sticky
covering
yeasty
slightly
tart
aroma
featuring
some

over
a
light
pale

base
smooth
flavor
of
phenolic
clove
apple
light
bubblegum

honey
medium

and
lightly
dry
giving
it
some
crispness
a
convincingly
authentic
belgianstyle
beer
with
lots
of
yeast
and
only
a
touch
of
musty
funkiness
for
fun
overall
another
lovely
offering
from
goose
island
this
belgian
style
pale
ale
features
a
cohesive
blend
of
flavours
look
forward
to
seeing
more
of
their
offerings
in
alberta
in
the
near

best
of
all

beers

3
thumbs
up
o
great
beer
i
usually
do
not
like
belgian
pales
this
beer
is
balanced
well
between
malts
hops
and
yeast
will
buy
again
will
have
again
worth
trying
even
for
those
who
otherwise
probably
wouldnt
buy
something
with
bretti
include
myself
4

this
was
a
good
one
oddly
i
took
the
first
sip
and
thought
to
myself
this
is
too
sweet
and
chalky
then
the
second
and
third
sips
rolled
around
and
somehow
the
hops
started
going
to
work
and
calmed
down
the
intense
malty
yeast
profile
this
beer
carries
definitely
good
very
rich
beer
while
there
was
a
lot
of
sediment
visible
it
was
very
smooth
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
765ml
bottle
overall
very
nice
belgian
strong
pale
i
really
dig
the
unfiltered
appearance
of
this
ale
overall
really
bizarre
but
ive
gotta
say
i
enjoy
it
next
time
i
would
much
rather
have
a
nonspoiled
matilda
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
4
0
overall
very
enjoyable
flavorful
and
complex
but
all
elements
are
carefully
balanced
and
restrained
im
almost
surprised
that
i
can
buy
goose
island
in
alberta
almost
what
a
market
we
have
going
on
here
fingers
crossed
for
some
bourbon
county
in
the
future
appearance
is
good
nose
was
weak
flavor
i
the
tongue
was
a
solid
4
but
aftertaste
killed
it
lots
of
activity
on
this
beer
had
on
tap
at
ohare
airport
out
of
a
wine
glass
it
poured
a
pretty
auburnorange
really
nice
appearance
the
nose
had
notes
of
nuts
spices
and
yeast
the
flavor
was
similar
but
stronger
than
the
nose
let
on
not
usually
a
huge
goose
island
guy
but
this
is
a
good
one
o
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
with
the
reputation
goose
islands
rare
and
mainstream
beers
has
i
was
hoping
the
less
popular
would
still
be
really
good
a
good
but
very
overrated
beer
by
a
brewery
that
is
steadily
on
the
decline
if
not
for
their
admittedly
magnificent
bourbon
county
series
goose
island
would
be
a
second
or
even
third
tier
brewery
i
question
whether
the
current
batches
of
this
beer
are
faithful
to
the
ones
in
the
past
which
i
remember
being
much
fuller
in
flavor
and
more
fully
realized
overall
than
what
i
have
tried
on
several
occasions
of
late
overall
nicely
done
and
a
pleasant
brew
for
sipping
and
contemplation
after
hearing
nothing
but
great
things
about
this
beer
online
where
i
work
and
on
beeradvocate
im
thoroughly
disappointing
goose
islands
matilda
a
beer
that
clearly
looks
to
cater
to
those
not
so
invested
with
goose
islands
more
mainstream
line
while
the
beer
presents
itself
nicely
in
look
and
smell
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
something
to
be
desired
the
immediate
taste
isnt
bad
effectively
presenting
an
extremely
yeasty
but
potent
beer
until
it
descends
into
a
sharp
biting
aftertaste
that
is
along
the
lines
of
a
cheap
high
gravity
malt
liquor
i
can
equate
it
to
the
same
kind
of
pungent
taste
of
highalcohol
i
got
when
swallowing
camo
silver
ice
after
a
few
small
to
medium
sips
of
this
the
taste
becomes
overcompensating
to
the
point
where
the
beers
introductory
taste
isnt
even
the
slightest
bit
appetizing
anymore
and
i
just
sought
to
finish
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
cant
see
how
this
beer
merits
such
exceptional
ratings
its
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
all
year
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
that
i
will
continue
purchase
along
with
any
other
goose
island
products
i
can
get
my
hands
on
o
very
complex
would
have
liked
more
fruit
character
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
ales
ive
had
appearance
is
a
hazy
brownish
orange
with
lots
of
large
bubbles
evident
in
the
beer
smell
is
dark
fruit
clove
allspice
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
plum
banana
yeast
clove
biscuits
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
a
full
body
but
not
overly
heavy
carbonation
is
quite
light
o
reminds
me
of
a
summer
beer
for
sure
refreshing
light
easy
drinker
little
pricey
for
a
session
beer
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
but
if
available
may
purchase
again
would
like
to
taste
if
after
some
aging
to
see
what
changes
the
big
bottle
with
wax
who
doesnt
love
an
event
when
opening
a
beer
it
pours
hazy
copper
gold
with
a
dense
creamy
off
white
head
the
smell
has
a
lot
going
on
wheat
oranges
slight
floral
hops
biscuity
the
taste
has
slight
fruitiness
but
that
biscuit
smell
is
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
hops
show
up
near
the
end
along
with
some
candi
sugar
but
it
is
a
very
balanced
flavor
its
like
a
huge
party
where
no
one
is
wearing
bright
colors
but
no
one
looks
the
same
very
subtle
very
diverse
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slightly
tingly
thats
the
technical
terms
if
you
were
wondering
didnt
want
to
frighten
anyone
off
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
many
things
none
of
them
overdone
and
all
of
them
done
right
o
a
solidly
made
american
version
of
a
belgian
beer
a
good
amount
of
thought
went
into
making
this
one
and
it
shows
o
nice
and
reserved
very
pleasant
mix
of
flavors
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
10192013
o
almost
perfect
remarks
not
what
i
expected
at
all
given
its
called
a
pale
ale
seems
to
be
more
of
a
saison
to
me
glad
i
found
two
of
these
girls
in
a
remote
lcbo
location
in
northern
ontario
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
the
beer
is
enjoyable
i
wonder
if
it
was
more
complex
when
fresh
brewed
in
2006
maybe
i
will
pick
up
a
newer
batch
and
check
against
this
review
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
quality
as
the
finish
is
long
and
complex
i
expected
a
year
to
do
something
to
this
but
instead
theres
not
too
much
else
to
report
other
than
this
is
like
many
other
farmhouse
styled
ales
ive
had
domestically
with
this
containing
the
notable
exception
of
appearing
cleaner
and
crisper
in
body
than
others
ive
had
in
the
past
its
solid
and
extremely
food
friendly
paired
excellent
with
hand
patted
grilled
burgers
and
isnt
a
bad
price
10
but
theres
honestly
other
beers
of
its
kind
that
id
more
often
run
to
get
and
especially
that
goes
for
those
id
lay
down
orval
itself
for
instance
not
bad
but
i
definitely
heard
better
things
about
this
with
some
age
on
it
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
im
pretty
underwhelmed
by
this
one
still
very
drinkable
and
certainly
not
a
bad
flavor
just
a
little
light
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
i
trust
the
merchant
highly
on
the
storage
second
review
i
feel
the
same
about
this
get
the
big
apple
flavors
but
low
sour
quality
world
class
beer
though
a
2010
properly
cellared
bottle
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
to
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
left
light
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
light
stone
fruit
and
mild
oxidation
flavor
begins
subdued
dried
light
stone
fruit
and
light
caramel
but
the
caramel
intensifies
towards
the
finish
revealing
bready
malt
and
more
intense
stone
fruit
flavors
mildy
buttery
medium
bodied
i
took
brief
notes
on
this
when
i
bought
it
fresh
and
they
reveal
that
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
it
finding
the
flavors
pleasant
but
underwhelming
i
have
been
skeptical
about
the
claim
on
the
bottle
that
it
would
age
for
up
to
five
years
im
not
in
doubt
now
this
has
turned
out
quite
nicely
still
somewhat
restrained
but
the
light
fruit
fruit
flavor
of
the
young
beer
have
not
so
much
intensified
as
become
deeper
like
dried
fruit
quite
enjoyable
and
i
will
certainly
age
this
one
again
if
i
see
it
had
at
lunch
at
harry
carays
poured
into
glass
from
bottle
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
hazy
orangecopper
color
spicy
yeast
fragrance
2nd
beer
as
good
if
not
better
i
dont
get
to
enjoy
this
enough
it
was
as
expensive
as
a
dram
of
single
malt
scotch
whisky
a
must
try
goose
island
matilda
in
my
opinion
is
a
world
class
beer
of
the
highest
quality
it
pours
copper
colored
finger
sized
head
and
medium
carbonation
it
has
tastes
of
hops
malts
and
fruits
this
is
do
to
the
styrian
and
saaz
hops
that
is
used
it
has
a
spicy
fragrance
goes
down
smooth
for
a
belgian
ale
and
has
pleasant
after
taste
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
goose
island
this
is
a
great
beer
perfect
beer
i
only
ask
those
who
try
it
pour
it
in
a
glass
im
a
big
fan
plus
i
distribute
this
brand
in
ny
right
now
i
am
aging
sofie
year
by
year
to
see
the
difference
in
taste
matilda
is
my
new
girlfriend
watch
out
you
will
fall
in
love
with
her
overall
an
interesting
beer
havent
had
very
many
belgian
styles
but
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
and
easy
to
drink
belgianstyle
beer
this
almost
didnt
feel
like
beer
since
there
really
any
hops
noticeable
and
the
same
could
have
been
said
for
the
alcohol
i
had
to
pace
myself
while
drinking
this
and
only
a
slight
warming
sensation
that
came
over
me
as
i
polished
this
off
led
me
to
realize
that
there
was
booze
in
this
while
not
outstanding
this
was
the
best
and
most
accessible
example
of
this
style
that
i
ever
had
and
worth
a
go
for
anyone
who
has
never
tried
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
or
strong
ale
before
not
too
sweet
funky
or
overpowering
matilda
was
a
beer
that
id
grab
again
as
i
await
the
transition
to
warmer
days
ahead
subtly
enjoyable
and
up
to
par
with
its
european
counterparts
drank
another
one
today
02202014
that
is
dated
08192010
it
has
a
nice
dirty
flavor
and
a
crazy
fruity
aroma
carbonation
is
off
the
charts
im
glad
i
saved
it
but
it
could
have
been
at
prime
a
while
ago
until
next
time
o
delicious
and
one
i
would
definitely
go
to
again
o
awesome
beer
that
holds
up
quite
well
i
have
no
doubts
that
this
will
age
as
the
bottle
says
willing
to
put
this
up
against
other
higher
end
belgians
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
with
a
cigar
o
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
id
have
this
again
anytime
lightly
effervescent
in
the
mouth
delicious
overall
definitely
an
interesting
beer
the
wide
variety
of
flavours
throughout
are
great
but
are
all
kept
in
tight
moderation
it
feels
restrained
and
could
be
better
if
there
was
some
part
that
really
burst
out
all
in
all
a
good
american
belgian
o
im
not
that
impressed
would
rather
have
a
trappiste
rocheforte
6
over
this
anyday
but
a
faily
decent
attempt
at
the
style
which
i
might
add
is
not
my
favorite
o
as
i
said
twice
its
interesting
its
good
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
recommended
as
are
most
of
their
beers
crisp
with
nice
carbonation
shy
of
medium
body
very
easy
drinking
very
nice
o
this
is
definitely
a
great
ale
this
is
the
first
ive
had
and
it
definitely
will
not
be
the
last
if
i
can
help
it
this
is
one
that
i
am
rating
overall
higher
than
sum
of
the
parts
due
to
the
nature
of
the
combination
i
feel
it
is
warranted
o
yeast
presence
drives
the
nose
taste
mouthfeel
of
this
excellent
belgian
strong
ale
this
isnt
my
goto
style
but
was
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
going
to
try
the
other
gi
ladies
to
see
what
they
are
about
poured
a
bottle
before
dinner
first
the
beer
is
rich
orange
it
poured
with
a
little
haze
that
cleared
up
as
it
came
down
in
temp
its
a
white
head
with
good
lacing
and
active
carbonation
through
the
whole
beer
the
smell
is
over
ripe
bananas
and
some
funkiness
thats
i
cant
really
compare
to
another
smell
likely
the
belgian
yeast
is
driving
that
smell
the
taste
is
wonderful
with
a
dry
apple
flavor
with
sour
notes
its
a
great
belgian
malt
and
yeast
flavor
its
dry
in
the
mouth
and
the
sour
lingers
in
a
good
way
overall
another
good
beer
from
goose
island
they
never
seem
to
disappoint
me
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
spices
with
sweet
tropical
fruit
flavored
with
an
abv
of
only
7
the
alcohol
does
tend
to
protrude
through
the
beer
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
character
you
would
expect
in
awa
by
the
way
my
bottles
were
bottled

stunningly

i
admire
this
beer
more
than
i
like
it
i
have
3
more
bottles
to
form
a
better
opinion
o
i
keep
dipping
my
toes
into
the
belgian
yeast
pool
and
each
time
the
water
is
just
not
quite
my
style
i
appreciate
all
of
the
qualities
of
this
beer
but
the
sour
funkiness
of
it
is
still
not
to
my
liking
as
i
do
not
possess
actual
fancy
beer
glasses
this
was
poured
into
a
wine
glass
per
the
helpful
suggestion
on
the
label
serve
in
given
that
the
label
design
mimics
a
fancy
wine
bottle
label
this
seemed
appropriate
even
though
i
know
ive
already
probably
broken
some
important
beer
rule
it
has
a
very
appealing
honey
amber
color
and
slight
foam
it
reminds
me
of
unfiltered
apple
cider
and
at
first
whiff
offers
similar
intense
fruit
id
characterize
it
as
concord
grape
with
a
background
of
mustiness
grass
and
hella
yeast
the
concord
grapes
follow
through
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
imo
though
tempered
by
a
refreshing
dryness
and
if
it
werent
for
that
inherent
dryness
id
have
to
say
the
lingering
sweetnessfruitiness
would
really
lose
me
but
evidently
the
brave
men
and
women
on
goose
island
were
one
step
ahead
of
my
unsophisticated
palate
theres
also
an
appealing
fizziness
at
work
as
a
further
counterbalance
to
that
potentially
cloying
fruit
overall
its
drinkable
but
hearty
sweet
and
sweettempered
but
slightly
edgy
7
alcohol
oh
my
and
definitely
earnest
but
in
a
good
way
overall
its
aite
but
yeah
bye
light
brown
in
color
with
a
light
head
of
foam
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
good
clarity
smell
that
belgian
yeast
strain
and
a
light
biscuity
malt
you
can
definitely
sense
the
alcoholbut
it
is
very
smooth
the
alcohol
does
not
overwhelm
instead
it
complements
the
yeast
and
malt
backbone
im
buying
into
the
hype
after
this
tasting
nice
bpa
with
plenty
of
character
to
tease
the
senses
onice
belgian
ale
easy
drinking
and
good
depth
of
flavor
o
a
well
balanced
brew
that
has
great
flavor
the
spice
profile
plays
well
off
the
earthiness
and
fruit
presence
im
anxious
to
grab
more
and
put
done
age
on
it
bottle
2013
vintage

an
amber

with
a

that
fades
slowly
to

some

with
bit
of
caramel
taste
of

some
caramel
sweetness
citrus
with
some

in
the

subtle

and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
medium

smooth
with
a
nice
bit
of
malty
character
nicely
balanced
as
the
there
is
no
hint
of
the
7
abv
nice
beer
for
the
style
a
solid
effort
yet
there
is
nothing
present
here
to
propel
this
beer
into
the
realm
of
outstanding
very
good
beer
the
aroma
hits
you
in
the
face
and
its
followed
by
an
explosion
of
flavors
its
has
a
nice
spice
to
it
with
some
hints
of
clove
and
banana
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
7
abv
the
goose
island
vintage
line
is
excellent
also
recommend
trying
sofie
and
lolita
my
favorite
by
goose
island
was
fleur
but
unfortunately
they
retired
it
pours
a
deep
orange
in
color
with
a
1finger
foamy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
of
hum
actually
different
maybe
some
bananas
grains
and
spice
as
for
the
taste
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
very
complex
actually
after
several
sips
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
actually
slight
dry
finish
but
not
bad
at
all
o
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
duvel
in
terms
of
quality
but
perhaps
not
quite
there
who
cares
its
still
freaking
excellent
id
really
be
intrigued
in
aging
this
one
even
further
too
oa
gourmet
beer
for
only
10
dollars
plus
on
average
recommend
6
months
plus
on
aging
will
thicken
and
become
more
pronounced
in
taste
goose
island
not
only
makes
standard
quality
styles
esbipaseasonal
they
can
craft
a
huge
bottle
of
belgian
beer
worth
your
cash
overall
i
might
down
the
entire
4
pack
i
bought
tonight
this
is
disappearing
from
my
glass
at
a
surprising
pace
keeper
itll
be
hard
to
cellar
if
i
buy
it
because
ill
just
want
to
keep
drinking
it
o
dry
and
yeasty
with
some
nice
barnyard
aspect
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
o
this
brewery
has
left
me
disappointed
there
staples
are
mediocre
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
a
wild
funky
unleashed
version
of
sophie
not
quite
as
good
as
the
ommegang
products
but
for
an
american
style
belgian
wild
ale
with
brett
pretty
much
best
of
breed
shes
a
doll
i
heart
matilda
o
very
good
i
like
how
the
level
of
brett
was
just
right
ive
had
other
beers
where
the
brett
had
taken
over
very
enjoyable
and
better
than
some
other
bpas
ive
had
o
interesting
to
have
a
pineapple
leaning
after
the
normal
belgian
bananaclove
flavors
quite
respectable
this
is
a
big
big
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
with
all
of
the
hops
i
find
the
malt
is
the
starmaker
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
real
surprise
if
im
honest
i
had
been
expecting
this
one
to
be
a
good
beer
but
i
was
taken
aback
by
just
how
good
it
turned
out
to
be

poured
a

slightly

with

one

with

is
a
little
flowery
to
me
for
some
reason
also
picking
up
some
yeast
breadiness
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
and
some
tropical
fruits
like
mango
and
tangerine
mouthfeel
is
fuller
thanks
to
some
yeast
not
too
sharply
carbonated
but
finish
is
dry
and
crisp

seems
to
be
wellbalanced
as
i
get
some
bitter

some

caramel
candi

and
more
of
that
pleasant
tropical
fruit
rush
like
tangerine
and
pineapple
and
dragonfruit
according
to
my
stepson
overall
just
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
is
representative
of
the
style
excellent
quenching

extremely
complex

honestly
this
is
not
a
great
bspa
whether
brettd
or
not
lets
be
clear
for
the
style
it
is
unrefined
and
under
everything
but
ignoring
style
its
really
nice
minicomplex
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
it
seems
a
more
flavorful
than
other
offerings
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
i
would
like
to
drink
it
again
but
not
out
of
a
pint
glass
the
taste
is
focused
on
the
malt
and
citrus
element
there
is
a
moderate
hopped
bitterness
bringing
up
the
rear
but
it
does
not
linger
long
o
this
is
a
brett
beer
no
doubt
about
it
i
wish
the
bspa
flavors
were
more
prominent
its
good
but
like
most
gi
beers
that
arent
in
the
bcs
series
is
over
rated
and
not
something
i
would
buy
again
o
refreshing
sophisticated
more
like
a
fine
wine
experience
a
nice
dessert
beer
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
order
again
but
its
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
great
belgian
ale
right
here
recommended
can
anyone
school
me
on
this
type
of
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
nice
example
of
the
style
but
i
will
have
to
track
down
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
it
to
because
at
this
point
i
feel
like
the
brett
had
really
taken
over
and
i
think
more
of
those
fruity
and
belgian
pale
ale
aspects
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
would
come
through
when
its
fresh
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
that
the
brett
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
and
i
think
one
12oz
bottle
is
the
right
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
very
good
and
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
unbalanced
the
flavor
was
it
seems
like
the
brett
really
took
over
i
would
for
sure
buy
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
and
aged
one
and
i
cant
really
see
this
getting
any
better
with
more
age
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
really
likes
brett
forward
beer
but
it
might
be
a
little
too
funky
for
your
average
craft
beer
drinker
all
in
all
i
was
happy
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
i
could
see
this
beer
being
pretty
promising
fresh
so
i
will
for
sure
be
looking
for
a
fresh
bottle
and
i
will
update
this
review
accordingly
its
a
nice
beer
but
at
this
point
its
a
brett
bomb
nice
work
guys
this
belgian
series
is
my
favorite
thing
you
guys
put
out
keep
on
expanding
the
series
o
delicious
very
light
and
delicate
very
flavorful
gotta
love
that
bit
of
brett
too
overall
really
good
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
they
may
be
owned
by
abinbev
but
goose
island
is
still
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
the
color
was
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
orange
hue
not
much
foam
and
very
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
sourness
the
taste
had
a
sour
spices
flavor
not
what
i
expected
from
a
belgium
pale
ale
its
an
ok
pale
ale
but
not
what
i
would
buy
again
oa
good
and
accessible
belgian
strong
ale
shares
some
characteristics
with
saisons
would
drink
again
o
a
beer
as
elegant
as
the
label
everything
about
it
begs
for
more
an
irresistible
appearance
nuanced
and
very
well
balanced
refreshing
flavors
great
texture
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
taste
degrades
noticeably
as
it
gets
warmer
meaning
that
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
you
better
go
through
it
quickly
which
you
will
be
all
to
happy
to
do
o
this
is
an
amazingly
approachable
clean
and
drinkable
beer
especially
since
i
am
not
normally
a
sour
beer
fan
from
the
belgian
pale
ale
name
i
was
not
expecting
the
emphasis
on
lambictype
characteristics
but
this
was
obviously
formulated
to
emphasize
them
i
find
it
to
have
all
the
customary
components
a
belgian
sour
would
but
is
lacking
in
some
complexity
compared
to
the
originals
overall
impression
a
nice
belgian
recreation
by
an
american
brewery
combining
classic
belgian
yeast
and
biscuity
malt
character
it
also
adds
in
a
nicely
bitter
finish
to
round
out
a
well
balanced
beer
thus
beer
is
incredibly
complex
aging
has
done
wonders
to
this
beer
to
meld
all
of
the
flavors
the
brett
adds
another
level
to
the
beer
with
the
greatness
it
adds
theres
a
light
spice
note
on
the
aroma
with
some
peppery
characters
the
flavor
is
pleasingly
zesty
with
a
touch
of
that
pepper
light
and
delicate
with
more
nuance
and
subtle
flavor
than
i
could
have
asked
for
yum
well
certainly
an
interesting
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
regularly
but
this
is
excellent
i
can
see
why
people
would
go
nuts
for
this
and
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
it
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
how
the
brett
character
changes
highly
recommended
o
a
belgian
pale
with
big
sour
ale
leanings
this
thing
is
a
beauty
that
may
not
cater
to
all
tastes
but
definitely
got
my
attention
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
very
nice
brew
i
havent
had
one
fresh
so
i
dont
know
what
four
years
has
done
to
this
brew
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
quite
a
nice
mixture
of
funkiness
and
tartness
never
leaning
too
heavily
towards
one
side
though
the
funk
may
have
the
lead
by
just
a
nose
if
youve
had
this
fresh
and
didnt
like
it
i
recommend
sitting
on
it
for
a
while
overall
pretty
solid
bspa
and
with
a
touch
of
funky
brett
too
love
it
might
have
to
buy
a
few
bottles
and
age
first
keg
i
bought
on
my
dual
kegerator
great
beer
loved
the
hints
of
spice
and
very
refreshing
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
with
a
great
after
taste
it
can
pack
a
punch
so
dont
go
slamming
them
down
as
quickly
as
you
pour
them
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
beer
again
at
some
point
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
quality
gi
have
done
a
superb
job
with
this
belgian
ale
could
easily
pass
for
the
genuine
article
it
looks
sublime
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
exude
tart
fruity
notes
that
possess
a
classic
belgian
character
light
barnyard
funk
adds
depth
body
is
pitchperfect
wellrounded
to
which
the
age
of
the
bottle
probably
contributed
very
nice
and
highly
drinkable
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
this
poured
hazy
and
amber
with
not
so
much
carbonation
and
just
a
finger
of
foam
good
lace
really
fruity
and
floral
nose
on
this
beer
i
can
smell
the
pilsner
malt
and
i
love
that
its
got
a
little
booze
in
the
nose
but
im
not
offended
theres
some
caramel
as
it
warms
a
little
spice
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
this
beer
is
very
rich
on
the
palate
orangey
belgian
yeast
musty
then
pepper
and
coriander
and
hop
bitter
really
well
played
like
good
hand
in
cards
malt
is
pretty
sweet
and
the
body
is
a
touch
syrupy
this
one
is
pretty
wild
with
complexity
but
never
disintegrates
nice
balance
crisp
dry
finish
and
puts
bitter
and
honey
together
with
a
brett
character
and
is
inviting
and
intoxicating
matilda
is
a
magical
beer
serendipity
is
the
word
i
always
use
to
describe
my
first
time
trying
it
i
had
no
opinions
or
expectations
prior
to
a
friend
offering
me
a
sample
but
i
instantly
fell
in
love
true
it
doesnt
hurt
that
the
recipe
is
modeled
after
one
of
my
alltime
favourite
ales
orval
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
a
phenomenal
and
enchanting
offering
belgian
pale
ale
refermented
with
brett
and
a
very
good
rendition
at
that
worthy
of
comparison
with
the
likes
of
orval

does
it

that

d
this

highlights

solid

was
pumped
to
find
this
locally
and
am
hopeful
it
will
continue
to
be
on
the
shelves
o
a
nice
complex
beer
i
could
see
how
a
white

drinker
might
be
attracted
to
this
id
like
to
try
this
again
fresh

a
wonderful

and
while
its
not
as
good
as
the
beer
to
which
it
is
an
homage
orval
or
some
of
the
other
orvalinspired
beers
being
made
in
the
states
its
easy
to
find
and
consistently
worth
buying
a
bottle
from
time
to
time
and
if
you
have
the
patience
to
sit
on
it
for
a
bit
i
recommend
it
especially
if
youve
had
it
fresh
before

another

beer
from

overall
goose
island
beer
co
is
becoming
my
close
second
in
terms
of
favorite
american
breweries
next
to
ommegang
ive
had
their
nut
brown
pepe
nero
sophie
and
now
matilda
all
of
which
i
really
like
to
love
if
you
arent
familiar
with
their
brews
i
suggest
trying
them
out
very
diverse
selection
for
those
that
enjoy
a
wide
spectrum
of
brews
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
that
id
recommend
to
anyone
who
even
hinted
at
liking
a
beer
any
beer
once
if
someone
likes
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
they
absolutely
need
to
experience
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
i
guess
is
what
im
saying
it
far
exceeded
expectations
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
belgian
pale
ale
that
makes
me
think
im
drinking
a
hefeweizen
at
times
and
a
faintly
fruity
ale
at
other
times
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
for
this
one
but
since
my
old
boss
ordered
and
paid
for
a
round
of
this
one
i
got
it
and
was
very
pleased
with
it
definitely
a
great
springsummer
beer
to
have
and
not
terribly
overpriced
either
4
excellent
for
the
style
a
fantastic
beer
for
warm
nights
p
s
also
had
a
2011
version
and
its
still
nothing
compared
to
the
2010
i
highly
recommend
drinking
this
with
at
least
3
years
on
it
amazing
the
matilda
is
a
mix
of
amber
and
cooper
with
a
bubbling
almost
white
neck
and
hazy
body
the
aroma
exposes
very
well
cloves
and
honey
and
a
little
spice
in
the
taste
hop
bitterness
is
present
well
harmonized
with
the
malt
of
which
i
expected
more
expression
the
end
leaves
us
with
hops
very
briefly
though
its
a
good
beer
although
too
much
alcoholic
in
comparison
with
its
other
elements
that
are
more
discrete
and
delicate
thumbs
up
overall
o
funk
is
just
showing
in
this
citrus
forward
pale
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty

lots

and
good
yeast
complexity
malt
and
hops
support
well
but
the
yeast
is
the
star
phenols
were
a
bit
offputting
overall
a
nice
zesty
mildly
funky
brew
that
could
easily
be
a
summertime
standby
o
this
is
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
theres
really
nothing
to
make
it
particularly
stand
out
note
on
lacing
is
it
possible
that
a
glass
is
so
clean
and
waxxy
smooth
that
it
doesnt
allow
for
much
clinging
of
the
foam
i
e
the
foam
slides
back
down
into
the
water
and
nothing
will
stick
to
the

id
swear
that
was
what
was
happening

a

for
my
liking
i
suppose
the
hops
have
all
faded
away
sounds
like
im
reviewing
juicy
fruit
gum
sorry
to
be
so
redunant
with
fruity
this
beer
was
a
surprise
to
me
so
i
was
pleased
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
great
change
of
pace
brew
d
this
had
a
great
scent
but
only
mediocre
taste
and
body
the
finish
wasnt
entirely
clean
so
it
was
not
the
easiest
to
drink
im
curious
how
age
would
affect
it
but
it
was
only
average
fresh
from
reading
all
the
reviews
thats
what
it
has
to
be
will
try
it
once
again
to
make
sure
but
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
give
a
poor
rating
the
beer
drinks
more
towards
a
dubbel
because
of
the
toasted
maltiness
and
sweetness
overall
another
great
beer
from
goose
island
makes
me
psyched
to
get
my
2
four
packs
of
bcbs
solid
belgium
pale
ale
one
of
the
nicer
belgian
styles
to
come
from
an
american
brewery
actually
tastes
like
something
from
belgium
had
i
not
known
where
it
was
made
i
would
have
guessed
belgium
has
a
nice
blend
of
the
flavors
i
expected
all
balanced
well
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
o
a
very
good
bspa
which
is
much
better
than
the
disappointing
sofie
o
really
good
belgian
strong
ale
solid
all
around
pours
a
deep
reddish
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
fluffy
beige
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
smells
of
sugary
malt
with
pomme
and
light
pitted
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spice
and
pepper
to
round
out
the
nose
nicely
the
flavor
is
sugary
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
and
light
sugar
heavy
fruit
flavors
remind
me
of
pear
tangerine
and
sweet
orange
hints
of
spice
provide
the
only
balance
to
the
sweet
malt
and
fruit
flavors
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
belgian
strong
simple
straightforward
and
quite
enjoyable
a
little
more
than
light
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
almost
feels
watery
this
is
a
2012
bottle
not
sure
why
there
should
be
any
issue
with
lacking
flavor
it
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
carbonation
when
i
opened
it
i
may
try
this
again
later
and
update
the
review
and
scores
if
needed
seems
to
be
just
average
for
now
o
wow
very
complex
flavors
mixed
in
here
with
a
wonder
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
a
fantastic
beer
at
7
abv
this
is
a
one
or
two
and
done
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride
let
this
one
warm
up
and
little
and
it
just
gets
better
and
better
very
much
worth
looking
for
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
goose
island
poured
a
cloudy
amber
bottle
gushed
a
bit
on
opening
its
alive
tall
belgian
style
head
left
some
nice
lace
marvelous
complex
aroma
of
spices
and
fruits
mouth
feel
was
creamy
tangy
spice
notes
came
through
strongly
in
the
flavor
i
have
a
weakness
for
belgian
style
blonde
ales
and
an
automatic
suspicion
when
american
brewers
claim
to
make
them
for
me
goose
island
knocks
this
one
out
of
the
park
and
at
only
7
abv
i
can
have
another
overall
i
will
try
again
soon
and
edit
but
for
now
not
impressed
o
a
really
nice
balance
has
been
created
this
is
one
that
makes
you
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
beer
that
is
much
tastier
with
some
age
lucked
out
and
just
got
this
off
the
shelf
at
wegmans
today
great
belgian
aspects
to
it
o
this
is
very
impressive
to
me
and
my
taste
buds
right
now
the
dryness
with
the
citrus
and
sour
notes
are
at
perfect
harmony
for
my
palate
i
will
def
be
grabbing
more
of
these
off
my
shelf
and
might
even
throw
one
in
the
cellar
to
experiment
after
tasting
goose
islands
underperforming
sophia
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
their
matilda
but
i
like
to
try
belgians
of
all
kinds
and
so
gave
this
one
a
try
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
had
a
nice
light
smell
of
hops
it
was
nicely
carbonated
but
did
not
have
a
foaming
head
that
one
would
expect
the
color
was
of
rust
the
high
point
was
a
distinct
sour
flavor
and
sharp
aftertaste
both
of
which
make
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
food
this
could
turn
into
a
regular
beer
o
a
real
treat
overall
nice
brett
character
but
thats
kinda
the
most
interesting
aspect
i
wish
i
had
written
down
how
old
this
bottle
was
alas
o
overall
a
nice
example
from
goose
would
love
to
compare
a
properly
stored
and
developed
bottle
i
imagine
the
hops
would
blend
a
little
more
and
lose
some
of
their
sharpness
usually
i
love
hops
as
fresh
as
possible
but
in
this
instance
i
imagine
it
would
improve
really
nice
well
balanced
ale
good
body
and
flavor
with
a
moderate
potency
falls
somewhere
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
pale
in
character
very
enjoyable
wouldnt
pass
this
up
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
pretty
well
rounded
belgian
pale
perhaps
a
touch
in
the
sweet
side
but
the
carbonation
works
that
out
nicley
very
enjoyable
o
i
find
this
beer
very
interesting
and
unique
every
time
i
try
it
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
floral
notes
seem
to
dominate
this
beer
for
me
abv
is
nice
it
makes
for
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
without
getting
in
the
way
of
other
flavors
i
dont
recall
being
so
impressed
with
high
carbonation
before
o
its
pretty
tasty
and
true
to
the
style
the
bottle
was
bottled
on
31212
and
states
it
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
five
years
so
im
interested
to
see
how
this
matures
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
could
use
some
refinement
to
keep
the
wet
richness
persisting
throughout
the
entire
progression
final
thoughts
a
good
depth
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
body
would
i
drink
it
again
perhaps
bottled
on
030112
picked
this
up
in
a
growler
what
a
funky
fetid
beer
like
moldy
lemon
peel
pine
trees
and
wet
cork
the
smell
of
wet
socks
asserted
itself
right
away
and
wouldnt
let
go
the
foamy
head
was
generous
but
dissipated
quickly
a
orangey
golden
color
and
mild
malty
aftertaste
would
not
choose
this
one
again
overall
simply
a
fantastic
belgian
let
us
hope
abinbev
does
nothing
to
change
the
way
this
beer
is
made
lest
they
do
the
world
of
craft
brewing
a
great
disservice
oi
had
a
hard
time
figuring
this
brew
out
the
funk
nearly
overwhelmed
me
on
the
nose
in
a
bad
way
and
i
also
thought
the
feel
was
a
little
weird
nevertheless
the
taste
was
decently
complex
and
despite
its
shortcomings
i
liked
this
beer
i
am
especially
curious
to
see
how
it
holds
up
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
since
it
says
you
can
age
for
up
to
five
years
overall
matilda
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
fruity
belgianesque
ale
o
overall
good
belgian
yeastiness
musky
damp
and
well
balanced
though
i
prefered
sofia
a
bit
more
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
very
small
head
smells
of
sour
peach
orange
and
serious
spice
definitely
a
heavy
sour
forefront
nice
spice
on
the
tongue
with
some
pear
and
orange
peel
bit
of
a
hop
bite
flavor
not
as
strong
as
i
was
hoping
could
use
a
little
more
fruit
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
other
nice
spicy
notes
which
was
disappointing
as
everything
else
about
it
is
superb
refreshing
beer
overall
not
overyly
aromatic
maybe
at
warmer
temps
though
subtle
but
strong
belgian
feel
thick
and
filling
great
beer
drink
ability
outstanding
very
nice
flavors
in
the
beer
and
quality
all
around
one
of
the
better
domestic
belgian
pale
ales
that
ive
had
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
you
will
see
out
there
you
take
in
mind
when
reading
what
i
wrote
the
brew
i
am
drinking
is
a
little
over
a
year
old
and
not
sure
if
its
is
one
of
those
bpas
that
is
meant
to
be
aged
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
yes
but
then
again
i
didnt
get
it
for
that
much
either
salud
personally
4
mainly
for
the
ease
of
drinking
really
wasnt
impressed
by
this
highly
rated
beer
expected
more
considering
the
price
of
the
four
pack
drank
it
in
a
champagne
glass
like
the
bottle
states
but
that
didnt
really
help
its
cause
dark
red
to
light
brown
color
and
very
clear
next
to
no
head
at
all
the
after
taste
was
distinct
but
very
unpleasant
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
bursting
with
fruits
yeast
taste
is
good
fruity
malts
yeast
very
rich
feels
full
bodied
in
the
moth
and
overall
is
a
top
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
first
beer
from
goose
island
and
extremely
satisfied
perfect
beer
for
the
cooler
months
to
help
warm
up
while
sipping
sour
aftertaste
not
won
of
my
favorites
overall
very
excellently
malted
belgian
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
compared
to
other
belgians
super
nice
this
is
the
smoothest
belgian
i
have
ever
tasted
nice
orange
color
not
as
strong
as
many
belgians
but
that
may
be
agood
thing
for
this
beer
granted
belgian
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
appreciate
90
of
them
this
beer
had
a
very
nice
floral
smell
and
taste
with
a
great
sweetness
balance
not
sure
what
the
matilda
name
is
about
matilda
reminds
me
of
a
bruiser
theis
beer
is
a
delicate
flower
a
quality
introduction
to
the
style
o
this
beer
is
definately
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
i
hesitate
to
call
it
great
but
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
pour
is
somewhat
transparent
copper
with
a

definite
funk
from

but
very
smooth
and
flavorful
as
it
finishes
very
drinkable
especially
considering
its
7
punch
i
would
get
it
again
tasted
from
bottle
remarkably
smooth
as
i
worked
through
the
bottle
and
the
temperature
was
not
what
it
was
fresh
out
of
the
refrigerator
nice
overall
was
maybe
expecting
more
brett
character
but
there
was
a
good
fruit
profile
that
was
kind
of
surprising
the
fruit
sweetness
and
the
relatively
unwieldy
mouth
feel
threw
me
off
at
first
and
it
seemed
cloying
but
i
will
admit
that
this
beer
is
a
fine
one
having
delineated
its
various
components
the
strong
pear
notes
up
front
are
to
be
appreciated
and
the
esthery
gummy
sweetness
is
a
purposeful
counterpoint
to
its
inherent
astringency
ultimately
this
beer
finished
smooth
after
a
thoughtful
diverse
rollercoaster
of
belgian
flavors
and
textures
bet
its
better
on
tap
though
maybe
even
spectacular

a

saline
quality
to
go
with
the

here
more
like
a
mix

a
very
admirable
job
of
providing
subtle

which
would
not
turn
off
the
neophyte
while
impressing
the
experienced
overall
a
nice
fresh
tasting
belgian
strong
pale
while
not
super
strong
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
a
good
drinker
and
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
pours
a
pretty
clean
deep
orange
decent
head
bubbly
smell
is
a
little
yeasty
and
sort
of
fruity
taste
is
remarkably
clean
a
little
apple
and
a
little
citrus
but
it
works
vague
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
balance
smooth
oily
feel
makes
it
all
the
more
easy
to
drink
its
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
your
mind
but
its
remarkably
drinkable
o
scratches
the
belgian
itch
and
brewed
here
in
the
good
ol
usa
abinbev
owned
or
not
good
stuff
pours
very
nice
with
a
desert
orange
color
the
smell
reminds
me
of
apples
and
fruit
that
are
almost
over
ripe
the
taste
is
smooth
and
has
a
apple
and
spice
taste
that
is
a
little
funky
but
enjoyable
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
in
the
glass
the
aroma
changes
to
more
of
a
earthy
note
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
too
overpowering
either
way
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
slight
foamy
head
smell
is
sweet
slightly
hoppy
taste
is
sweet
as
well
with
a
smooth
creaminess
i
tasted
a
hint
of
honey
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
7
00
abv
perfect
mediumbodied
brew
paired
well
with
a
monte
cristo
sandwich
nice
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
beer
matilda
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
worth
putting
a
few
in
the
cellar
if
you
can
stand
the
wait
pours
an
orange
color
that
is
somewhat
hazy
nice
2
finger
head
that
leaves
some
retention
smells
of
yeast
funk
lemon
and
banana
bread
pretty
sweet
smelling
taste
still
has
some
hops
to
it
fruits
and
yeast
also
compliment
the
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
pretty
complex
and
very
enjoyable
get
matilda
while
you
still
can
and
cellar
it
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
the
aroma
concerned
me
a
bit
the
flavor
was
not
bad
but
a
little
one
dimensional
not
sure
ill
be
getting
this
one
again
o
since
moving
to
delaware
i
am
enjoying
having
some
goose
island
beers
available
to
me
this
is
not
a
style
i
usually
drink
but
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
good
aroma
with
complex
fruit
and
malt
flavors
i
will
probably
get
it
again
o
a
nice
light
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
not
as
flavorful
and
complex
as
some
other
examples
but
very
solid
would
pair
beautifully
with
salmon
or
a
good
steak
the
aroma
is
all
sour
brettanomyces
with
a
faint
spiciness
there
is
some
clove
and
banana
a
rich
flavor
greets
at
first
taste
there
is
a
flavor
of
buttery
caramel
a
sourness
from
the
yeast
compliments
this
beer
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
aging
overall
good
though
not
great
nice
smell
o
very
nicely
balanced
flavors
and
great
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
certainly
a
very
complex
beer
this
beer
is
good
for
those
who
like
a
challenge
dissecting
the
ingredients
in
their
beer
overall
a
beer
that
truly
reprsents
the
style
a
beer
i
will
purchase
again
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
scent
beginning
with
sweet
belgian
candy
sugar
and
finishes
with
the
funky
mustiness
balanced
with
a
spicy
finish
altogether
everything
is
very
well
balanced
with
everything
kept
in
check
no
one
character
overtakes
another
medium
bodied
but
lacks
a
bit
of
the
voluminous
carbonation
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
styled
ale
o
amazing
what
a
little
brett
does
i
cant
say
i
love
it
but
this
is
intriguing
clearly
well
made
and
goes
down
easy
oreally
well
balanced
delicately
flavored
beer
very
impressed
by
the
new
goose
island
beers
and
reasonably
priced
overall
wow
i
will
single
handedly
name
this
beer
a
testament
to
how
my
palate
has
changed
over
the
past
6
months
i
could
not
stand
this
beer
it
was
ok
at
best
now
i
really
enjoy
it
really
cool
stuff
and
this
was
a
satisfying
to
drink
if
for
nothing
else
than
to
appreciate
my
growth
as
a
beer
advocate
ill
definitely
get
again
albeit
probably
on
tap
goose
island
is
fairly
new
here
to
pa
but
each
time
i
drink
one
of
their
beers
i
get
more
impressed
and
this
one
was
no
different
my
first
go
around
with
this
beer
was
not
nearly
as
fantastic
as
this
time
just
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
available
all
the
time
nice
the
beer
pours
an
orange
yellow
like
dehydrated
piss
with
an
ever
so
slight
touch
of
blood
the
head
is
big
and
soapy
with
a
nice
slightlycream
white
head
and
nice
sticky
fat
lacing
on
the
sides
creating
cloud
rings
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
mildly
hazy
but
is
still
quite
opaque
and
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
little
bubbles
dancing
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
thick
with
bananay
yeast
that
makes
me
think
of
the
jungle
there
are
some
nice
slight
spices
on
the
sides
of
the
smell
perhaps
a
hint
of
cloves
and
something
even
more
zesty
the
malt
is
also
not
hiding
in
this
smell
with
a
nice
palesweet
malt
waftings
the
beer
tastes
very
similarly
to
its
smell
with
a
great
forward
bananataste
from
the
yeast
with
slight
clove
and
zest
on
the
sides
of
and
a
solid
sweet
pale
malt
backing
to
the
beer
there
is
almost
a
hot
spice
tingle
on
the
tongues
tip
to
start
off
this
beer
which
is
very
intriguing
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
lightly
marbled
a
perfect
consistency
for
a
pale
ale
there
is
some
weirdly
harsh
carbonation
right
at
the
front
of
the
sip
but
this
dies
away
almost
immediately
and
just
leaves
a
slightly
burnt
feel
on
the
tongue
after
taste
is
very
subtle
and
fresh
with
a
faint
weird
medicinal
funk
though
this
does
not
standout
strongly
the
mouth
is
left
very
clean
after
the
sip
with
minimal
saliva
or
dryness
outside
of
the
affects
of
the
carbonation
there
is
very
little
sign
of
hops
in
this
beer
which
is
fine
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
this
beer
definitely
delivers
for
its
style
it
is
deliciously
bananalike
and
its
lacing
is
fantastically
thick
worth
a
drink
for
the
belgian
lovers
and
the
beer
lovers
alike
and
definitely
an
upper
level
example
of
the
style
sour
yeasty
bite
up
front
followed
by
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
rich
malt
character
nice
play
between
sour
yeast
and
sweet
malt
backed
by
fruity
undertones
a
very
rich
and
complex
brew
this
bspa
is
awesome
its
a
style
that
fails
me
more
often
than
wows
me
this
ones
right
up
my
alley
really
i
love
the
drinkability
that
you
dont
get
in
a
duvel
or
a
pranqster
the
funkiness
is
a
plus
and
the
yeast
isnt
pushing
all
sorts
of
usual
suspects
at
me
different
and
excellent
now
to
just
get
my
hands
on
more
overall
not
really
my
style
but
i
did
like
this
one
seems
well
made
onot
as
easy
of
a
drinking
beer
that
i
was
hoping
it
definitely
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
true
belgian
and
its
much
too
syrupy
and
boozy
for
the
low
abv
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
i
get
a
decent
amount
of
sour
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
strong
belgian
pale
ale
im
glad
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
in
new
jersey
this
is
a
beer
i
could
never
recommend
o
very
pleasant
well
balanced
brew
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
with
neither
really
taking
over
d
nice
overall
but
not
great
i
enjoy
it
enough
but
i
bought
a
whole
four
pack
and
they
arent
being
consumed
quickly
something
about
the
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
o
easily
my
favorite
belgian
from
gi
combines
big
yeast
and
malt
character
to
produce
a
masterful
ale
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
a
bottle
recently
great
mixture
of
the
desired
flavors
and
not
an
ounce
of
the
abv
presence
great
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
enjoy
a
beer
with
brett
and
some
sourfunk
this
beer
satisfies
that
for
me
but
might
not
appeal
to
everyone
i
would
be
happy
to
have
this
one
another
time
mu
understanding
is
that
in
this
recent
iteration
the
bubblegum
flavor
is
stronger
than
in
other
vintages
id
like
to
try
an
older
bottle
sometime
to
see
if
its
a
bit
more
balanced
and
nuanced
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
as
you
might
expect
a
brettanomycesinfected
beer
would
be
theres
still
a
bit
of
body
left
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
little
american
wild
ale
its
not
super
complex
because
it
wasnt
crafted
to
be
this
just
happens
to
be
a
tasty
accident
that
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
intentionally
recreated
and
the
recall
of
these
infected
batches
led
to
the
creation
of
the
pretty
awesome
dominique
and
if
you
didnt
get
a
chance
to
try
dominique
im
sorry
if
you
have
been
sitting
on
any
bottles
of
brettd
matilda
know
that
they
are
drinking
pretty
nicely
right
now
two
years
later
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
the
carbonation
level
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
its
outstanding
and
i
wish
i
had
more
in
the
cellar
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
hints
of
ruby
head
was
neglible
even
with
a
moderately
vigorous
pour
though
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
meander
throughout
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sour
cherry
bret
yeast
and
coriander
this
bottle
is
dated
over
a
year
ago
and
the
flavor
profile
is
different
than
what
i
normally
think
of
for
matilda
the
elements
that
were
so
evident
in
the
aroma
are
present
but
greatly
tamed
sourness
is
nearly
nonexistant
leaving
the
yeast
and
spice
to
take
over
the
front
end
though
neither
is
especially
dominant
a
healthy
dose
of
wheat
comes
in
on
the
back
end
along
with
some
trace
bitterness
and
some
grassiness
a
hint
of
alcohol
makes
its
presence
felt
as
well
but
nothing
glaring
for
a
7
abv
maybe
its
the
aging
or
maybe
i
need
to
let
it
warm
up
some
but
this
is
much
more
subdued
than
i
remember
its
very
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
pep
that
i
look
for
from
a
belgian
style
ale
it
does
seem
to
be
well
crafted
however
so
if
pale
ales
are
your
thing
or
your
looking
to
try
one
for
the
first
time
then
this
is
probably
one
to
check
out
o
a
very
pleasant
well
balanced
and
thoroughly
quaffable
brew
fits
the
style
well
and
worth
a
buy
notes
really
well
done
bspa
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
country
orchard
fruit
must
haygrass
sweetness
is
a
strong
suit
but
the
tartfunk
is
well
integrated
with
the
maltiness
yeast
and
spices
are
there
but
not
that
strong
especially
for
the
style
originally
reviewed
11092010
o
nice
belgian
pale
good
go
to
belgian
by
goose
island
o
excellent
beer
but
it
doesnt
hit
the
next
level
for
me
still
happy
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
pa
finally
134
pack
of
12
ounce
should
be
an
excellent
beer
for
the
summer
o
this
beer
was
excellent
after
a
year
and
five
months
of
age
on
it
would
love
to
try
fresh
to
compare
definitely
would
buy
again
o
the
complexity
in
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
higher
side
imo
i
find
that
the
kick
of
hops
actually
offsets
the
balance
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
in
battle
between
the
hoppy
bitterness
and
sweetness
created
from
the
honey
character
at
the

overall
a
pretty
nice
beer

definitely

these

are
not

are

o
this

incredibly

probably
one
of
the
most
pleasant
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
ever
encountered
delicate
subtle
and
incredibly
balanced
try
this
now
overall
very
complex
beer
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewer
cant
wait
to
have
again
o
a
solid
american
take
on
the
classic
bspa
it
goes
belgian
without
losing
that
american
edge
sure
it
doesnt
push
the
envelope
to
the
edge
of
the
table
but
it
gets
the
job
done
regardless
solid
beer
that
is
enjoyable
any
time
overall
a
really
nice
brett
pale
with
some
light
well
integrated
funk
i
would
really
like
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
a
couple
years
and
the
funk
becomes
more
integral
to
the
beer
still
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
beer
while
fresh
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
beer
a
great
one
if
youre
looking
to
get
a
bmc
drinker
into
craft
to
show
the
possibilities
of
spices
in
beer
a
very
pleasent
light
sipper
i
absolutely
love
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
especially
the
restrained
sournessfunktartness
the
bretanomyces
was
used
very
admirably
here
the
bottle
is
about
a
year
old
so
im
wondering
how
much
that
this
effects
the
flavor
or
if
its
just
released
with
some
age
on
it
at
the
ohare
pub
at
terminal
c
this
belgian
ale
shows
a
beautiful
copperishamber
color
with
a
delicate
white
cap
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
classic
belgian
clove
blended
nicely
with
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
nutty
biscuit
very
nice
the
flavor
brings

the

d
smooth
and
nice
but
i
sont
know
how
much
i
can
do
of
it
the
fruitiness
is
quite
intense
with
pears
which
is
odd
to
me
but
not
bad
for
a
beer
i
guess
just
different
dpretty
decent
drinkability
flavors
are
very
smooth
pretty
complex
and
fun
and
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
nicelybalanced
brew
which
seems
to
be
what
g
i
was
going
for
here
through
north
central
ohio
this
is
most
likely
the
best
beer
out
there
50
a
case
ball
hardits
worth
it
i
am
a
believer
just
a
grand
beer
understated
how
good
this
is
why
havent
i
tried
this
before
holy
god
it
has
the
best
aspects
of
an
ipa
tripel
belgian
just
so
drinkable
the
taste
is
quite
good
there
are
slight
sherry
like
flavors
some
nice
orange
rind
some
peppery
spices
some
sweet
citrus
flavors
too
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
beer
although
it
is
very
smooth
and
sweet
the
beer
is
not
creamy
but
more
liqueur
like
in
its
consistency
the
beer
is
not
overly
complex
and
for
that
im
going
to
detract
a
point
or
two
there
isnt
enough
of
an
overlay
between
the
spices
the
sweet
malts
the
candied
sugars
and
the
belgian
yeastiness
to
get
this
one
going
into
a
higher
level
it
is
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
but
complex
to
the
point
of
challenging
the
palate
this
beer
is
not
a
good
find
worth
seeking
out
belgian
spice
aroma
with
a
hint
of
funk
that
turns
must
as
the
beer
warms
flavor
has
a
quick
hit
of
the
brett
funk
but
finishes
clean
a
very
well
made
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
enjoy

12oz
matilda
into
a
shaped
pint
glass
pours
a
superrich
beautiful
amberorange
color
with
a
frothy
little
head
very
clear
smells
of
rich
belgian
yeast
banana
and
apples
kind
of
fruity
tasting
not
as
yeasty
as
it
smells
little
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
and
a
leathery
finish
nice
full
mouthfeel
but
it
just
lacks
something
in
the
flavor
its
kind
of
boring
very
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
dang
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
tends
to
go
better
with
a
meal
vs
on
its
own
i
have
it
on
occassion
but
every
time
it
sounds
great
when
i
start
but
by
the
time
im
done
im
ready
for
something
different
overallim
not
overwhelmed
by
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
the
7
abv
peeks
through
a
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
but
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
make
it
well
worth
a
try
definitely
fairly
enjoyable
d
thanks
to
imperialking
for
this
treat
d
i
tell
you
with
a
mouthfeel
like
that
this
brew
is
absolutely
drinkable
so
crisp
and
clean
it
goes
down
super
easy
it
sits
pretty
light
in
the
belly
with
just
a
touch
of
that
alcohol
heat
this
beer
is
disappearing
quickly
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
well
done
and
further
add
to
the
enjoyability
of
this
brew
i
hyped
this
one
up
in
my
mind
and
the
experience
was
not
a
let
down
in
the
least
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
seeked
it
out
this
a
damn
good
beer
so
true
to
the
original
style
could
have
been
brewed
in
belgium
yummy
d
even
at
7
very
drinkable
i
was
excited
about
this
offering
and
enjoyed
it
even
more
than
expected
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
is
fine
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
worthy
of
the
price
i
would
not
necessarily
recommend
though
i
would
happily
drink
another
if
offered
d
a
strong
american
ale
not
the
belgian
it
would
like
to
be
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
lightly
spicy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
2006
beer
is
lighter
in
body
and
less
of
a
head
the
2008
has
more
of
a
head
that
is
creamy
and
rocky
the
2008
has
more
spice
but
is
not
as
refined
as
the
2006
both
of
the
years
has
it
pros
and
cons
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
light
orange
very
light
copper
color
the
beer
produces
a
nice
size
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
go
away
very
fast
at
all
and
which
leaves
a
great
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
and
yeasty
has
a
pretty
good
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
great
fruity
sweet
and
just
a
little
bitterness
i
havent
had
to
many
belgians
but
from
the
ones
ive
tried
i
think
this
one
compares
pretty
good
i
think
goose
island
definitely
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
personally
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
just
seemed
to
be
missing
something
d
even
at
7
very
drinkable
i
was
excited
about
this
offering
and
enjoyed
it
even
more
than
expected
d
slightly
high
abv
not
detected
at
all
sweetness
kinda
limits
this
to
just
one
for
me
very
nice
beer
going
to
the
beer
store
today
and
picking
some
up
d
this
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
its
good
taste
wish
i
could
of
had
more
of
this
beer
than
just
one
bottle
worth
the
effort
to
get
d
very
good
i
wish
i
had
more
definitely
something
that
is
worthy
of
being
aged
ill
have
to
try
a
fresh
matilda
for
comparison
now
but
this
was
excellent
d
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgian
ales
but
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
id
be
happy
to
have
it
again
and
id
love
to
try
it
at
goose
i
would
also
be
interested
to
see
how
this
flavor
manifests
itself
over
time
notes
by
far
my
favorite
goose
island
offering
and
superior
to
the
similarly
marketed
labeled
pere
jacques
at
least
the
labels
emulate
one
another
great
job
overall
this
beer
is
overadvertisedhyped
upon
pouring
this
into

the
body
is
dark
burnt
yellow
with
a
twothree
finger
head
it
smells
a
tad
bit
sweet
with
a
light
barley
aroma
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
not
too
much
alcohol
that
comes
through
despite
the
7
00
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
gives
off
pleasurable
tones
to
your
palate
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
for
some
reason
i
expected
it
to
be
even
better
perhaps
it
is
because
goose
island
produces
such
high
quality
common
styles
such
as
their
ipa
among
the
rest
still
a
very
good
beer
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
strong

intersting
comlex
flavor
and
very
good
co2
and

it

at

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
cant
help
thinking
that
the
ones
i
had
last
year
were
even
better
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
in
either
case
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
style
pale
d
although
it
is
pretty
high
in

i
can
put
a
few
of
these
away
in
a
night
its
pretty
thin

has

it

all
in

pretty
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
not
sure
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
some
but
if
the
opportunity
did
happen
to
arise
i
would
take
it
up
slightly
cloudy
coppery
in
color
nice
offwhite
lasting
head
smells
of
bananas
wheat
bread
and
general
belgianness
taste
hits
what
they
were
going
for
as
an
american
version
of
a
bspa
mild
euro
hops
sugar
belgian
qualities
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
slightly
above
average
conclusion
complex
drinkable
perfectly
balanced
this
is
a
spoton
american
representation
of
a
classic
belgian
style
g
i
has
done
it
again
theres
actually
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
that
took
me
a
while
to
pick
up
perhaps
it
just
didnt
go
well
with
dinner
but
that
tropical
fruitiness
is
quickly
overtaken
by
a
strong
bitter
hop
flavor
which
then
yields
to
crisp
finish
d
i
have
passed
this
by
so
many
times
and
it
is
just
too
bad

very
enjoyable

way
to
go

beer
copper
colored
with
a
slight

one
finger
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
to
a
light
skim
some
spotty
lacing
present
smells
of
esters
banana
clove
and
a
muted
sweetness
characteristic
of
belgians
blind
i
might
say
this
smells
more
like
a
hefeweizen
taste
is
not
too
appealing
very
lacking
in
flavor
some
faint
carryover
from
the
nose
with
cloves
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
thin
palate
decent
carbonation
and
okay
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a

more
from
this
beer
maybe
it
needs
some
aging
i
wont
waste
the
space
on
it
to
find
out
good
thing
it
came
in
a
4pack
and
not
a
6pack
sampled
matilda
at
the
oregon
brewers
fest
in
portland
it
pours
a
nice
head
but
with
little
lacing
and
offers
the
palate
a
subtle
taste
of
brown
sugar
as
a
belgian
it
finds
a
pleasant
equilibrium
of
malt
and
sugar
without
the
expected
cloyingness
and
yet
i
could
not
grasp
the
complexity
unlike
many
other
belgians
i
have
tried
the
matilda
is
good
for
about
two
quaffs
not

this
is
a
really
nice
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
yet
showcases
a
true
example
of
a
belgian
bspa
vs
an
american
bspa
try
this
one
next
to
a
la
chouffe
duvel
delerium
tremens
and
see
what
i
mean
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
my
point
is
to
comparecontrast
a
traditional
vs
newer
twist
style
of
beer
really
a
good
experience
and
i
will
drink
this
whenever
avaliable

and

the
balance
and
great
taste
of
this
beer
would
obviously
make
it
drinkable
but
i
was
still
surprised
by
how
fast
i
managed
to
down
one
very
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
md
medium
bodied
verging
on
full
very
chewy
feel
throughout
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
excellent
feel
to
the
beer
taste
is
wonderful
light
on
the
palate
but
full
of
flavor
it
is
nice
and
sweet
unexpectedly
sweet
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
has
a
great
balance
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
flavor
mixed
together
i
think
that
is
what
makes
this
beer
stand
out
nicely
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
orangish
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
left
just
slight
traces
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
tart
green
apples
plums
dates
and
what
reminds
me
of
an
odd
saltiness
like
that
found
in
the
nose
of
a
gose
just
less
so
the
flavor
is
also
filled
with
fruity
esters
with
apples
leading
the
forefront
there
is
a
slight
kiss
of
hops
in
the
flavor
but
they
add
just
more
of
a
vague
bitterness
to
it
also
brown
sugar
and
what
is
a
slight
sweet
cream
are
also
present
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
just
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
this
is
another
very
good
beer
by
goose
island
i
will
definitely
be
buying
another
4
pack
next
year

an
interesting
and
unique
brew

solid
offering
from

a

one
at

low
for
the

id
put
this
right
at
the
middle
of
the
pack
as
far
as
the

limitedseasonal
releases
go
about
on
par
with
the
imperial
ipa
better
than
the
demolition
and
slightly
below
the

and
the

this
would
pair
well
with
a
spicy
dish
thai
food
perhaps
or
a
strong
cheese
that
could
hold
its
own
against
the
phenols
in
this
one
recommended
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
am
sad
that
this
is
my
last
one
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
overall
an
incredible
beer
that
i
wish
we
could
get
ahold
of
down
here
in
louisiana
my
former
boss
at
southern
eagle
who
gave
me
this
beer
can
help
with
that
hint
hint
trey
goose
island
did
a
great
job
recreating
a
belgian
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
yeast
strain
just
doesnt
jive
with
my
palate
i
dont
think
i
dont
mind
funk
by
any
means
but
this
has
a
bit
of
a
funkiness
to
it
that
im
not
wild
about
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
personal
favorites
d
i
enjoy
belgians
and
this
one
is
quite
mild
it
is
easy
to
drink
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overpowering
nice
and
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
pours
a
cloudy
lighthoney
color
dense
but
quickly
fading
foamy
tan
head
fades
into
a
nice
swirly
layer
atop
the
beer
stray
spots
of
lacing
inside
the
glass
soft
sugary
aroma
pepper
and
spice
i
get
some
vanilla
flavor
pear
and
oddly
enough
theres
something
here
that
reminds
me
of
the
one
and
only
time
i
ever
ate
breadfruit
some
light
pepper
flavor
comes
through
on
the
back
end
this
is
beautiful
refreshing
lively
carbonation
just
a
really
nice
beer
and
if
it
were
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
would
make
its
way
to
the
dinner
table
often
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
though
it
starts
out
strongly
sweet
matilda
dries
out
quickly
and
gracefully
the
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
components
fit
together
quite
well
to
create
a
beer
which
is
vividly
flavored
but
not
overpowering
citric
acidity
and
moderate
carbonation
cut
through
a
body
which
would
tend
towards
heavy
without
them
a
fine
example
of
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
nicely
done
if
your
a
fan
of
belgian
styles
in
general
check
it
out
the
only
down
side
compared
to
its
belgian
conterparts
is
it
doesnt
stand
to
warming
up
as
well
d
good
drinkability
its
a
nice
sipper
but
the
great
flavor
had
me
drinking
it
more
quickly
than
it
deserves
while
i
may
not
seek
this
one
out
id
definitely
drink
it
again
d
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
from
goose
island
i
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
another
bottle
check
it
out
if
you
see
it
well
done
for
the
style
and
very
tasty
but
the
carbonation
makes
if
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
semithick
somewhatfluffy
white
head
which
doesnt
leave
great
lace
or
stick
around
too
long
immediately
smells
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
sugar
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
strong
syrup
texture
to
it
it
is
definitely
a
belgian
beer
with
an
american
twist
pretty
good
beer
but
i
fell
it
is
still
missing
something
nothing
particular
but
something
is
keeping
it
from
becoming
a
truly
outstanding
drink
nevertheless
it
is
still
wonderful
very
nicesomewhat
orangey

solid
malty
aroma
with
a
good

beer
if
it
wasnt
as
high
abv
wise
i
could
do
this
on
a
very
regular
basis
drinkability
good
but
i
think
it
is
not
that
great
for
the
price
the
price
is
a
bit
high
on
this
one
but
worth
it
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
for
an
american
microbrewery
drinkability
not
the
easiest
drinker
in
the
world
not
that
smooth
sweet
but
not
a
belgian
that
i
want
to
come
back
to
drinkability
a
beautiful
and
flavorful
beer
right
at
that
cusp
of
abv
where
it
may
age
well
i
might
set
one
in
the
cellar
an
try
it
in
a
few
years
this
beer
poured
a
clear
reddish
gold
color
and
formed
a
small
foamy
white
heat
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
slight
funkiness
of
grass
coriander
and
other
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
candy
like
bubblegum
and
other

the

is

the

threw
me
a
bit
expecting
a
light
flavor
i
get
a
ton
of

a
very
sharp
mouthfeel
and
some
funk
i
get
more
of
the
sour

the

a

i
want
some

a
real
treat
served
in
an
oversized

final
thought
what
a
treat
on
tap
this
one
is
goose
island
should
be
proud
to
call
this
an
american
micro
brew
this
is
clearly
their
best
to
date
pours
a
dark
amber
in

theres
a
ginormous
three

very
creamy
and
full
in
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
flavor
as
well
not
overly
complex

very
drinkable
pours

small
hoppy

medium
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
fruitiness
in
the

easy
to
drink
and
quite
nice
pours
a
crisp
copper

similar
to

nice

some

it
decented
great
nose
sweet

of
fruit
mainly
pear
like
earthy

every

with

may
be
from
american

or
actual
cirtus
fruit
taste
is
good
more
subdued
more
assertive
hop
more
cirtus
less
earth
than
indicated
in
nose
but
some
bay
leaves
possibly
yet
not
as
herbal
as
expected
surprisingly
crisp
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
seems
like
it
would
be
for
seafood
probably
opens
up
in
flavor
in
the
cellar
pours
a
deep
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
lingers
for
ages
leaving
big
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
subtle
and
consists
of
biscuity
malts
and
citrus
including
some
tart
lemon
notes
theres
also
the
underlying
belgian
yeasts
and
spices
in
the
end
the
taste
is
a
slightly
sweeter
version
of
the
nose
with
the
aforementioned
belgian
yeasts
coming
to
the
forefront
and
a
much
stronger
fruity
sweetness
than
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
bananas
in
there
there
is
also
some
spices
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
hop
presence
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
leaves
the
tongue
tingling
after
ever
sip
this
is
a
great
belgian
from
goose

and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again

i
could

of
these
before
moving
on

if

somewhat
reminisicent
of

sipper
that
keep
the
abv
at
a

id
prefer
this
beer
in
a
bomber
but
that
said
do
not
find
the
4
00
price
tag
to
be
extravagant
in
the
least
definate
repeat
purchase
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
pa
with
brett
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
a
slow
sipper
but
great
to
have
inhand
dsmooth
and
very
drinkable
at
7
thought
abv
was
lower
overall
it
is
hard
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
others
do
it
so
much
better
md
rich
the
carbonation
is
almost
fuzzy
rather
than
fizzy
over
the
tongue
like
a
furry
peach
medium
body
a
nice
tangerine
flavour
left
behind
finishes
rather
clean
and
pleasant
a
very
easy
semisipper
i
found
myself
going
through
this
quite
quickly
an
excellent
beer
and
something
i
hope
to
find
again
or
have
another
glass
of
when
coming
back
this
way
i
thought
it
was
a
fine
beer
for
a
belgian
clone
and
would
drink
it
again
d
unfortunately
my
other
bottle
is
in
a
cellar
this
product
has
aged
very
very
well
poured
a
great
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
great
head
and
excellent
lacing
it
had
a
wonderful
scent
very
sweet
with
straw
scents
along
with
a
great
banana
scent
excellent
taste
a
great
sweet
start
with
some
nice
hoppy
balance
a
delicate
clove
and
banana
flavor
with
lemon
zest
undertones
went
down
fantastically
smooth
probably
one
of
the
best
american
made
belgian
strong
ales
ive
had
good
beer
great
for
when
a
high
abv
is
desired
wo
all
of
the
heaviness
it
usually
comes
with
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
nice
brew
to
consume
during
the
the
warm
summer
months
but
the
alc
might
cut
you
off
sooner
than
your
ready
if
your
not
careful
the
beer
pours
a
copper
colour
that
appears
to
be
golden
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
was
a
decent
centimeter
that
left
fairly
quickly
the
nose
of
the
beer
has
fruits
sweetness
and
some
spices
the
beer
has
lots
of
flavour
from
the
dark
fruits
like
plums
to
a
few
spices
the
complexity
to
this
beer
is
quite
more
than
i
expected
you
can
taste
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
but
i
really
dont
taste
any
hops
but
there
is
a
bitterness
to
it
lots
of
flavours
i
cant
really
pin
down
either
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
nice
bite
from
the
carbonation
the
beer
is
okay
in
the
drinkablility
department
d
pretty
damn
solid
recommended
im
happy
that
this
beer
has
finally
made
it
to
the
bars
in
the
twin
cities
served
on

this
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
ample
white
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
tart
apples
with
a
small
hint
of
sourness
the
taste
is
fruity
with
raisins
plums
and
a
tart
apple
flavor
predominating
there
is
a
not
unpleasantdryness
to
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
rich
and
flavorful
drinkability
is
only
marred
by
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content72abv
and
the
slightly
sour

all
in

this
is
a
good

with
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
back
taste
is
very
yeasty
and
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
yeast
bubbles
just
explode
with
a
swish
its
really
quite
unique
to
feel
the
brew
go
straight
from
a
liquid
state
to
a
mouthfull
of
bubbles
if
you
like
highly
carbonated
yeasty
beers
this
might
be
worth
a
try
unfortuantely
this
really
isnt
my
style
of
drinking
tasted
on
42408
the
flavor
up
front
was
of
belgian
spices
and
mild
fruit
a
slight
breadlike
quality
also
present
a
citrus
hop
bite
is
subtle
but
effective
in
creating
a
cohesive
and
flavorful
experience
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
great
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
carbonated
very
nice
farmhouse
ale
from
goose
island
i
love
the
farmhouse
belgians
and
you
could
pour
me
a
pint
of
one
of
these
and
id
be
absolutely
delighted
and
fooled
into
thinking
it
was
an
import
goose
island
just
keeps
doing
me
right
wish
they
were
easier
to
track
down
out
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
definitely
drinkable
not
my
favorite
belgain
style
ale
but
my
favorite
offering
from
goose
island
so
far
nice
brew
way
overcarbonated
a
bit
of
a
gusher
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
massive
head
when
it
settled
down
i
got
some
citrus
and
a
slight
sourness
brett
in
the
aroma
medium
bodied
with
some
fruit
and
spice
slightly
sour
finish
i
had
this
on
tap
over
spring
break
at
clybourn
and
this
was
totally
different
i
preferred
the
tap
version
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
strong
belgian
pale
the
smoothness
on
this
ale
makes
it
very
easy
on
the
tongue
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
when
you
have
it
but
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
me
too
hard
to
be
a
session
beer
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
idea
of
a
change
of
pace
beer
for
me
since
its
flavor
isnt
all
that
strong
a
good
stab
at
the
style
but
when
youve
got
monks
doing
this
for
centuries
to
compete
with
a
good
attemp
is
the
best
you
can
hope
for
very
drinkable
the
belgian
stalwarts
are
here
but
are
not
as
robust
as
other
examples
no
bonus
points
here
for
complexity
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
d
wow
i
love
this
brew
drinkable
and
nice
but
not
for
sessioning
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
from
gi
12
ounce
bottle
orangish
color
with
a
small
head
what
a
strange
beer
the
aroma
is
fruity
but
somehow
unlike
any
fruit
ive
eaten
its
sort
of
like
fruit
mixed
with
candy
and
ginger
some
winelike
grape
flavors
are
present
slightly
tart
but
still
candylike
in
its
tartness
finishes
with
spices
including
cinnamon
and
ginger
this
beer
left
me
confused
and
thirsty
still
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
its
certainly
an
interesting
beer
d
only
one
maybe
not
even
that
not
very
impressed
by
this
pale
ale
doverall
not
impressed
not
something
i
would
reach
for
on
a
regular
basis
dthumbs
up
a
world
class
beer
poured
into
an
oversized
tulip
glass
with
a
rich
golden
color
and
decent
amount
of
white
head
remaining
along
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
full
of
spices
and
bubble
gum
taste
is
floral
and
strong
on
the
belgian
spices
with
some
coriander
shining
through
mouth
feel
was
sparkling
and
crisp
very
nice
strong
pale
ale
d
sincerely
impressed
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
never
expected
these
hop
connoisseurs
to
go
belgian
but
they
did
and
i
gotta
thank
em
for
it
not
an
everyday
beer
of
course
or
even
one
to
drink
in
session
that
would
diminish
its
majesty
but
i
want
another
one
right
now
and
i
cant
cuz
i
have
to
go
to
work
interesting
aroma
with
a
hint
of
funkiness
and
tartness
along
with
some
citric
hops
and
malty
sweetness
that
unfortunately
does
not
translate
well
into
the
beer
nice
carbonation
but
it
lacks
depth
and
there
is
very
little
complexity
between
the
noticeable
hops
and
malts
pleasant
but
i
was
disappointed
d
extremely
drinkable
nicely
complex
one
of
my
favorites
4
75
crisp
and
bright
but
then
immediately
fades
to
starchy
and
rather
fluffy
short
lived
carbonation
with
a
fine
bubble
structure
some
faint
warmth
and
a
starchy
buttery
feel
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
tasty
and
refreshing
very
enjoyable
drinkabliity
is
good
this
brew
comes
in
at
7
apv
so
the
alcoholic
tinge
makes
sense
making
this
one
a
great
sipping
brew
another
great
offering
from
goose
island
cheers
rich
honey
colored
pour
with
no
lasting
head
pours
somewhat
hazy
smell
is
malty
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
some
metal
average
unremarkable
flavor
mostly
from
the
yeast
and
some
simple
light
maltiness
really
found
this
one
especially
tame
and
bland
even
being
congested
as
i
was
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
barelheadit
poured
a
nice
looking
hazy
light
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
the
nose
was
packed
full
of
bubble
gumfruits
and
spice
complexity
is
an
understatementthis
has
lots
of
fruit
peaches
come
to
mindfollowed
by
malts
and
a
hoppy
citrus
blend
that
balance
nicelywith
lots
of
cloves
and
yeast
very
apparent
in
every
sip
matildawhat
an
ugly
namebut
this
lady
is
a
brick
house
very
enjoyable
but
i
thought
one
was
enough
for
this
sitting
i
would
love
to
have
it
another
time
though
and
i
will
certainly
buy
the
bottles
this
would
be
a
good
belgianstyle
beer
for
people
who
think
dont
like
them
too
big
and
too
boozy
the
abv
is
reasonable
and
the
flavors
are
not
too
extreme
in
any
area
a
very
nice
drinking
belgian
very
smooth
ontap
the
taste
has
a
certain
fullness
to
it
that
is
mouthcoating
and
slightly
creamy
in
consistency
the
beer
is
lightly
sweet
as
well
which
upplays
the
fruity
citrus
character
that
is
here
the
hop
character
is
not
near
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
it
is
present
with
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
of
course
some
spicycitrusy
hop
notes
up
front
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
and
the
brett
character
is
still
quite
light
in
the
finish
there
is
a
hint
of
mustiness
and
a
bit
of
dry
cobwebtype
thing
that
lingers
in
the
finish
and
a
light
dusting
of
funk
in
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
does
not
quite
hit
the
complexity
level
of
the
original
we
will
have
to
see
how
this
changes
with
time
very
drinkable
shit
if
it
didnt
cost
2
25
apiece
id
probably
share
it
with
other
people
for
now
though
screw
em
this
is
all
mine
d
this
is
a
very
nice
drinking
belgian
not
crazy
overpowering
like
some
belgians
definitely
could
drink
a
few
glasses
d
not
bad
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
hop
bite
but
would
dring
anytime
as
an
alternative
to
a
belgian
golden
drinkability
i
purchased
a
four
pack
which
is
ok
because
that
is
about
all
i
want
a
nice
treat
and
worthy
of
trying
out
at
least
once
a
nice
beer
from
goose
island
pours
with
white
head
atop
a
copperlight
amber
body
aromas
of
spicy
yeastiness
with
a
classic
example
of
the
belgian
funkiness
the
taste
continues
the
experience
resulting
in
a
smoother
well
rounded
belgian
ale
the
brettomyces
definitely
lends
that
belgian
characteristics
that
those
familiar
to
the
style
appreciate
only
7
alc
by
vol
this
beer
finishes
with
apricot
spicy
notes
very
drinkable
offering
by
goose
definitely
recommended
very
nice
beer
from
goose
island
overall
this
was
not
bad
and
sure
i
have
had
better
but
not
to
distract
from
this
at
all
there
was
a
little
something
special
about
this
one
especially
given
the
very
nice
overall
contribution
from
the
funky
little
yeasties
who
were
making
their
presence
felt
overall
a
really
solid
call
and
i
would
not
turn
this
one
down
id
be
happy
to
have
this
at
my
table
anytime
with
the
things
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
there
are
a
few
likes
after
warming
it
seems
rather
crisp
there
is
range
and
complexity
but
in
the
end
fizzy
killed
definitley
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
easy
to
imagine
drinking
this
all
night
or
as
much
of
the
night
as
one
remained
upright
notes
bought
the
4pack
at
halftime
in
november
i
dont
remember
the
exact
price
but
it
wasnt
cheap
somewhere
around
13
for
the
4pack
so
i
wont
be
getting
this
all
that
often
i
also
cant
find
it
in
albany
but
a
worthwhile
beer
no
doubt
d
good
great
i
drink
this
a
lot
lately
matilda
i
could
really
grow
to
love
you
i
wish
she
traveled
my
way
more
often
shes
playing
hard
to
get
but
is
worth
the
chase
for
sure
d
very
nice
seems
it
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
its
lemon
twang
and
all
best
goose
island
i
ever
had
like
orval
but
fruitier
drinkability
very
enjoyable
although
a
little
strong
for
a
true
session
beer
goose
has
done
well
d
im
sipping
this
one
but
thats
because
i
want
to
enjoy
its
complex
and
subtle
flavors
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
and
it
really
is
easy
to
drink
a
good
american
made
belgian
beer
my
only
complaint
is
the
price
not
that
its
not
worth
the
money
but
for
the
price
of
a
12
oz
bottle
of
matilda
i
can
get
a
750ml
bottle
of
ommegang
so
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
many
more
of
these
still
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
pours
a
clouded
brown
with
gold
big
head
forms
off
a
not
very
firm
pour
nose
is
yeasty
a
bit
but
overall
is
very
subdued
doesnt
seem
to
deliver
a
whole
lot
extremely
mild
citrus
is
there
but
it
is
just
a
weee
little
bit
flavor
is
a
punch
in
the
mouth
firm
and
full
sweet
from
sugars
yes
but
the
yeast
plays
a
good
part
in
it
all
and
the
full
experience
is
well
rounded
and
mature
feel
is
a
bit
dough
like
on
the
liquid
with
a
thick
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
production
of
the
style
we
all
know
how
it
can
be
with
american
producers
trying
to
work
the
belgian
styles
not
the
case
here
quite
good
worth
trying
and
worth
holding
onto
for
a
while
to
see
what
may
happen
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
at
trader
joes
feeling
a
yearning
for
belgian
ale
coming
on
i
was
interested
to
discover
how
goose
island
dealt
with
the
style
pours
with
quite
a
quiet
head
a
fairly
pale
amber
and
a
hint
of
haze
aroma
slightly
muted
but
has
some
varietal
characteristic
taste
just
a
bit
disappointing
this
isnt
orval
trappiste
but
is
a
fair
imitation
of
the
style
this
is
a
2006
vintage
bottled
on
030206
so
it
is
a
little
over
a
year
and
a
half
old
i
foolishly
stuck
my
nose
over
the
bottle
and
took
a
whiff
the
bottle
was
a
gusher
and
i
began
breathing
foam
shit
the
color
is
a
nice
cludy
dark
orange
it
smells
slightly
medicinal
and
tastes
medicinal
and
dry
im
not
so
impressed
by
this
beer
its
ok
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
just
seemed
sloppy
to
me
given
2
tries
and
still
the
same
a
lot
may
be
due
to
it
not
being
a
style
i
enjoy
perhaps
but
just
found
it
confusing
not
sure
if
affected
by
age
but
other
reviews
had
me
expecting
more
least
favorite
gi
offering
thus
far
served
in
a
gi
reserve
tulip
glass
at
the
bavarian
lodge
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
persistent
white
head
citrus
and
pepper
aroma
with
grainy
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
adds
more
fruit
flavors
to
the
citrus
with
some
apricot
or
peach
prominent
brett
funkiness
that
tames
the
fruitiness
you
can
taste
the
hops
bitterness
if
you
concentrate
on
finding
it
but
its
only
in
a
supporting
role
a
wellcrafted
and
true
to
style
belgian
and
quite
drinkable
slightly
cloudy
orange
with
copper
highlights
and
a
rocky
two
finger
off
white
head
that
hold
its
own
big
lemony
citrus
and
rock
candy
aroma
followed
by
a
booziness
and
some
buttery
toffee
in
the
back
nutty
grain
bread
slight
caramel
malt
bill
citric
acidity
throughout
and
a
stiff
peppery
bitterness
follows
tea
like
florals
from
the
start
and
notes
fruity
orange
rind
and
clove
here
and
there
hot
for
a
7
0
but
can
be
easily
ignored
a
smooth
mouthfeel
fights
with
high
carbonation
that
bites
the
tongue
as
it
warms
earthier
and
somewhat
charred
grain
characters
become
more
apparent
doh
my
god
this
beer
is
so
good
it
should
be
banned
i
love
that
it
is
only
7
because
it
holds
enough
body
and
flavor
but
doesnt
wreck
you
after
the
first
bottle
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
every
night
this
goose
island
offering
pours
a
clear
clean
amber
moderate
carbonation
drifts
up
to
thick
craggy
white
head
some
lacing
noted
smell
is
floral
hops
lemons
and
an
earthy
element
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
some
sour
notes
as
well
at
first
i
was
a
but
put
off
but
the
beer
was
too
warm
the
sourness
mellowed
and
turned
out
to
be
enjoyable
the
sweetness
resembles
nut
bread
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
but
nothing
over
bearing
and
gets
cleaned
up
nicely
by
the
noted
sour
hints
and
hops
id
like
to
try
this
brew
again
for
sure
though
it
is
definitely
nothing
to
be
sessioned
this
beer
is
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
the
only
other
gi
beer
ive
tried
is
the
312
urban
wheat
so
this
is
a
pleasant
surpise
even
more
surprising
was
finding
4packs
of
these
in
minot
nd
this
certainly
isnt
for
fans
of
drier
belgians
but
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
version
ohh
how
looks
can
be
deceiving
went
to
my
fave
local
bar
and
i
was
the
first
to
get
this
beer
they
tapped
it
just
for
me
appearance
is
average
a
copper
color
with
very
little
carbonation
or
head
smell
is
of
fruit
and
yeast
but
thats
about
it
but
holy
crap
it
tastes
great
i
had
pen
in
hand
at
the
bar
to
review
this
beer
and
i
dropped
the
pen
its
really
really
damn
good
moutfeel
is
thick
and
full
and
wonderful
drinkability
is
also
very
high
just
wish
they
werent
6
bucks
a
pop
but
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
especially
on
draft
i
suggest
you
do
it
drinkability
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
be
honest
but
still
good
a
valiant
effort
to
pay
homage
to
the
big
boys
duvel
chimay
white
dt
but
not
quite
complex
or
interesting
enough
and
the
amount
of
hops
use
does
not
quite
seem

53dnot
crazy
about
this
one
nice
pour

hazy
amber
youll
get
some
white
head
and
lacing
if
poured
aggressively
notes
of
orange
and
cinnamon
were
pleasing

but
the
quaff
wow
orangey
cough
syrup
slightly
phonetic
and
woody
not
one
of
gis
better
brews
and
i
usually
dig
their
offerings
oh
well
ya
cant
please
everybody
all
the
time
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
nice
frothy

spotty
lacing
smell
is
sour
up
front
and
spicy
throughout
the
taste
is
sour
and
hoppy
with
some
coriander
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
the
carbonation
is
right
and
its
smooth
pretty
drinkable
slides
down
fairly
quickly
and
pleasantly
but
not
overly
complex
matilda
has
a
lot
to
offer
a
blend
of
smells
and
flavors
combine
to
give
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
overall
interpretation
is
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
enjoy
anytime
extremely
fine
carbonation
keeps
this
light
and
lively
though
it
does
have
a
slight
drying
effect
on
the

perilously
drinkable

with

does

at

point
ill
cellar
the
remainder
of
the
four
pack
and
try
it
again
in
a
year
as
i
usually
say
when
i
encounter
a
great
beer
like
this
can
we
find
this
on
tap
nearby
from
the
label
once
upon
a
time
in
a
valley
a
beautiful
countess
lost
something
precious
to
her
in
a
small
pond
racked
with
grief
she
prayed
for
its
return
very
quickly
it
resurfaced
in
the
most
wondrous
of
ways
after
her
prayers
had
been
answered
she
blessed
the
pond
and
valley
later
she
had
an
abbey
built
there
today
they
brew
beer
and
while
we
were
traveling
in
belgium
we
stopped
in
heard
the
story
and
tried
the
beer
really
good
beer
and
a
great
story
of
course
we
wanted
to
share
what
wed
heard
and
tasted
uusually
wed
do
that
over
beers
this
time
we
did
it
with
beer
recreating
that
experience
wasnt
easy
its
made
with
rare
yeast
thats
very
difficult
to
come
by
no
other
beer
we
make
is
like
this
slightly
fruity
with
a
profuse
amount
of
hops
its
great
with
a
plate
of
mussels
greg
hall
brewmaster
this
is
really
a
fantastic
brew
that
is
one
of
the
examples
that
could
quite
the
critics
of
the
american
belgian
style
ales
i
wish
i
had
this
at
my
disposal
a
little
more
regularly
enjoyable
beer
and
quite
a
ride
but
not
too
many
at
once
for
me
further
proof
that
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
opaque
dark
orange
with
a
reddish

yellow
head
of
very
tiny
bubbles
good
rings
of

some
cherry

off
and
expired
bakers
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
slightly
heavy
in
overall
body
flavor
is
an
unpleasant
mix
of
uncharacterful
bitter
and
too
much
sourness
secondary
tastes
of
slight
chocolate
and
more
apparent
raisin
linger
underneath
and
are
a
little
more
noticeable
close
to
the
finish
aftertaste
is
harsh
and
inappropriately
hoppy
for
the
type
of
beer
this
is
aiming
to
be
not
a
favorite
for
me
big
bodied
and
sweet
the
alcohol
isnt
too
prevalent
but
the
sweetness
tends
towards
reducing
drinkability
the
appearance
is
ambercolored
with
ok

aroma
is
sweet
and
a
bit

some
citrus

from
a

edit
42007
bottling
lots
of
estery
yeast
not
much
brett
presence
at
all
slicker
mouthfeel
will
cellar
for
6
months
to
see
if
any
brett
character
shows
up
i
had
this
originally
on
tap
at
a
tasting
and
then
later
at
the
brewery
but
never
thought
too
hard
about
it
or
gave
it
a
review
so
being
a
chicagoan
here
it
goes
this
beer
pours
an
orangey
must
color
with
decent
head
there
is
moderate
retention
and
some
lacing
at
first
smells
are
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
tripel
even
though
there
was
no
mention
of
it
i
assume
that
would
have
something
to
do
specifically
with
the
yeast
strain
and
the
basic
recipe
any
how
smells
of
belgian
yeast
some
sugars
mild
banana
cloves
pepper
and
some
other
spices
the
taste
is
much
the
same
maybe
at
first
a
smidgen
thin
but
honestly
it
opens
up
and
has
a
very
pleasant
after
taste
to
me
this
is
a
nice
american
version
of
a
modified
belgian
tripel
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
must
give
props
to
the
home
town
brewery
and
will
definitely
buy
this
again
had
this
on
tap
at
the
great
lakes
brewfest
in
racine
wi
orangey
with
tan
head
smells
great
buttery
and
hoppy
the
hops
are
flowery
and
sweet
smelling
with
vague
spices
in
there
too
taste
is
initally
watery
and
not
impressive
but
the
flavor
lingers
and
expands
and
becomes
truely
great
cloves
and
hops
tons
of
cloves
actually
and
some
black
pepper
great
a
real
blast
to
drink
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
have
another
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
as
far
as
gis
reserve
lineup
pere
jacques
is
worldclass
then
demolition
followed
by
matilda
all
of
these
beers
are
very
delicious
and
goose
island
is
to
be
commended
for
brewing
products
as
authentic
as
they
come
giving
the
belgians
a
run
for
their
money
highly
recommended
opinion
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
beer
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
goose
island
and
their
beers
are
known
to
be
pretty
good
i
had
considered
donating
the
other
three
beers
from
this
4pack
to
my
brew
clubbut
on
second
thoughti
will
probably
keep
them
in
my
own
cellar
these
beers
are
complex
and
if
they
truly
are
like
orvalthey
will
age
well
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
they
will
age
for
5
years
and
i
believe
that
nice
beer
great
hazy
dark
pancake
hue
that
is
quite
fruity
chewy
with
just
the
right
about
of
hoppiness
smooth
and
just
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
which
probably
wouldnt
have
been
so
apparent
if
i
read
the
label
matilda
is
yet
another
good
beer
in
gis
reserve
line
as
far
as
those
offerings
that
fancy
themselves
belgianesque
its
superior
to
demolition
1800
but
falls
short
of
the
superb
pere
jacques
goose
island
should
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
theyre
among
the
handful
of
u
s
breweries
who
are
able

give
the
belgian

i
am
not
doing
the
flavor

justice

it

at
all
except
for
the
feeling
down
my
tummy
and
my
breathing
afterwards
interestingly
drinkable
yet
not
my
favorite
lots
of
complexities
and
subtleties
that
binded
well
together
but
i
think
its
just
solid
in
the
end
obtained
in
a
bif
from
orbitalr0x
this
handsome
golden
ale
was
well
carbonated
and
a
four
finger
head
crowning
above
the
rim
prevented
me
from
emptying
the
entire
12
oz
bottle
into
the
appointed
oversized
wine
glass
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
floral
with
a
dusting
of
yeast
the
taste
was
dry
and
tart
with
earthy
yeast
funk
and
spices
also
appearing
in
liberal
doses
the
mouthfeel
was
a
hair
less
snappy
than
the
mighty
orval
a
good
belgian
style
pale
ale
on
its
own
merits
i
reviewed
this
quite
some
time
ago
and
was
frankly
shocked
by
some
of
the
low
reviews
of
course
the
06
could
be
worse
how
this
is
made
with
the
same
yeast
as
orval
is
amazing
to
me
as
i
cant
stand
orval
this
one
is
just
under
one
year
old
and
i
remember
loving
it
when
i
first
tried
it
not
much
has
changed
to
be
fair
i
will
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
a
new
batch
and
see
whats
up
d
drinkable
offering
from
goose
island
definately
worth
a
look
notes
of
anise
fresh
cut
grass
black
pepper
green
pepper
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
a
well
balanced
interpretation
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
d
good
drinkability
one
at
a
time
would
be
my
limit
damn
fine
interpretation
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
from
goose
island
id
place
the
drinkability
pretty
high
i
couldnt
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
it
hits
you
before
long
awesome
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
mildly
hazy
copper
color
it
was
topped
with
a
decent
sized
offwhite
head
that
settled
quickly
into
the
glass
big
spicy
nose
it
has
a
ton
of
yeasty
bread
a
little
cardamom
citrus
orange
all
backed
by
a
date
character
form
the
malt
the
flavor
reflects
the
aroma
quite
well
all
of
the
components
are
there
they
yeasty
flavor
is
milder
than
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
but
all
of
the
spices
are
there
along
with
a
bit
of
white
pepper
the
malt
has
a
bit
more
complexity
the
dates
are
accompanied
by
caramel
and
touch
of
green
apple
the
mouth
feel
is
rich
and
slightly
slick
theres
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
but
it
s
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
fine
example
of
this
style
maybe
the
best
ive
ad
produced
in
the
us
slàinte
spicier
than
expected
with
a
funky
sourness
that
is
very
similar
to
a
belgian
saison
apricots
lemon
apple
and
the
cinnamon
bite
of
big
red
gum
the
belgian
yeast
plays
a
major
role
in
trying
to
recreate
the
original
style
i
gotta
say
im
loving
these
big
brews
from
goose
island
their
imperial
ipa
bourbon
county
stout
are
ridiculously
good
and
the
matilda
demolition
do
not
lag
far
behind
all
are
wellworth
a
try
drinkability
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
the
flavor
seems
thin
and
incomplete
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wasnt
sure
about
it
at
first
but
it
really
grows
on
you
after
awhile
i
find
myself
returning
to
get
this
beer
again
and
again
overall
a
nice
tasty
bpa
from
the
goose
pours
a
vibrant
golden
orange
under
several
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
in
my
twisted
ayinger
hefe
glass
nose
is
a
lively
mix
of
sopping
wet
grapefruit
and
citric
hops
taste
is
juicy
grapefruit
slightly
bitter
tangerine
white
grape
pear
and
pineycitrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
spice
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
now
this
is
a
summer
beer
deceptive
at
7
its
fruity
hoppiness
is
a
real
thirst
quencher
on
a
humid
wisconsin
evening
another
strong
offering
from
goose
islands
reserve
selection
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
drinkability
quite
good
a
very
good
highly
drinkable
beer
i
dont
see
the
orvalness
in
this
definitely
more
on
the
side
of
a
belgian
pale
with
a
lot
of
residual
sweetness
you
get
a
hint
of
brett
character
but
its
pretty
well
buried
it
adds
to
complexity
tho
ultimately
this
beer
maybe
has
a
bit
too
much
going
on
to
really
pin
it
down
still
a
very
good
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
meld
quite
right
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweetflowery
for
me
i
wonder
what
age
could
do
to
it
yup
the
nutty
creaminess
saves
the
day
by
taking
the
edge
off
the
dry
carbonation
is
high
body
is
medium
making
this
a
pretty
nicely
refreshing
beer
easy
to
drink
but
gets
some
points
off
for
the
numbing
phenols
and
obvious
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
not
great
the
amount
of
hops
on
the
finish
leaves
a
very
grainy
residue
on
the
palate
definitely
a
food
beer
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
the
sweet
is
nice
but
not
enough
to
really
carry
the
beer
maybe
this
is
better
when
its
fresher
before
the
hops
have
been
dulled
to
nothingness
still
not
bad
nice
orange
color
with
a
filmy
offwhite
head
yet
lacking
that
beautiful
mountainous
foam
of
its
counterpart
it
does
nearly
equal
orval
in
the
aroma
its
dry
spicy
and
hoppy
with
a
mild
brett
character
and
hints
of
leather
caramel
perfume
and
cake
icing
im
trying
not
to
look
at
this
beer
as
an
orval
clone
because
in
the
flavor
its
far
from
it
whereas
orval
is
very
dry
with
a
horseblanket
flavor
i
find
this
to
be
very
sweet
but
i
can
imagine
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
brew
an
orval
clone
i
cant
even
brew
a
drinkable
ipa
still
though
in
itself
this
beer
is
still
very
enjoyable
the
yeast
suggests
hints
of
white
peppercorn
and
perfume
with
a
rich
herbal
and
floral
hop
flavor
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
subdued
compared
to
most
of
the
other
belgians
ive
had
which
frankly
i
liked
i
really
like
this
beer
because
it
is
not
overbearing
at
all
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
are
mild
but
wonderful
i
think
this
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
stuff
many
thanks
to
my
friend
karst
for
once
again
supplying
me
with
a
winner
pours
a
light
amber
cloudy
as
hell
fizzy
head
maintains
some
good
tracing
aromas
wow
apples
pears
candy
sugar
it
all
pops
out
somewhat
cloying
already
im
afraid
for
the
flavor
this
beer
has
quite
some
complexity
youre
first
hit
with
sweetness
followed
by
some
sourness
and
astringency
akin
to
orval
however
i
do
enjoy
this
one
much
more
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
gives
you
quite
a
zing
and
is
refreshing
alcohol
biting
a
little
at
the
swallow
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
would
go
wonderfully
with
some
brie
or
camembert
i
wish
i
had
some
ugh
glad
it
went
on
sale
locally
made
it
worth
my
purchase
dangerously
drinkable
even
at
7
i
could
quaff
a
lot
of
this
nectar
i
cant
believe
i
dont
have
any
more
bottles
i
need
to
get
more
i
bet
this
would
kill
with
a
slew
of
cheeses
mix
in
some
fresh
fruit
and
dear
god
goose
island
sure
can
brew
some
killer
beers
i
got
my
fourpack
in
lawrence
ks
for
9
it
is
a
top
notch
beer
at
a
great
price
seek
it
out
d
this
is
a
very
nice
addition
to
goose
islands
special
beer
series
as
ill
call
it
super
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
just
look
at
the
numbers
i
think
ill
quit
gushing
about
the
beer
now
and
get
to
enjoying
the
rest
of
it
edit

this
beer
has
become
a
favorite
of
mine
in
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
savor
bumped
to
a

0
from
a

5
mouthfeeldrinkability
so
rolling
so
easy
and
foamy
overall
a
more
fruity
twist
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
totally
enjoyable
i
dont
know
who
this
matilda
is
but
i
hope
to
meet
her
one
day
jen
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
am
not
overly
impressed
with
this
expensive
beer
it
has
sweet
malty
characteristics
with
a
backing
of
citrusy
apple
fruits
and
hops
it
is
light
in
body
and
quite
bubbly
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
that
it
is
worth
8
99
if
you
are
trying
to
decide
between
this
and
another
go
with
the
other
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
strong
blast
of
carbonation
that
dashes
across
the
palate
goes
down
fairly
easy
at
7
and
each
sip
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
id
say
drinks
well
no
overpowering
flavors
and
sits
well
12
ounce
bottle
orangish
color
with
a
small
head
what
a
strange
beer
the
aroma
is
fruity
but
somehow
unlike
any
fruit
ive
eaten
its
sort
of
like
fruit
mixed
with
candy
and
ginger
some
winelike
grape
flavors
are
present
slightly
tart
but
still
candylike
in
its
tartness
finishes
with
spices
including
cinnamon
and
ginger
this
beer
left
me
confused
and
thirsty
still
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
its
certainly
an
interesting
beer
this
ale
pours
a
candied
orange
color
that
leaves
a
bubbly
white
lace
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
black
licorice
root
beer
horse
blanket
wet
grass
citrus
and
candied
fruit
very
complex
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
palate
starts
bitter
with
a
black
licoriceanis
flavor
in
the
background
it
then
hits
with
a
dull
alcohol
presence
on
the
palate
that
has
some
bitter
bark
bit
on
the
tongue
then
it
finishes
semihoppy
with
a
light
carbonation
great
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
i
would
pair
this
beer
with
a
baked
haddock
stuffed
with
bread
crumbs
oregano
and
thyme
the
savory
stuffing
and
delicate
fish
will
really
compliment
some
of
the
licorice
canided
aspects
in
the
beer
also
the
beer
will
act
as
the
squeeze
of
lemon
some
people
put
on
fish
cause
of
the
citrus
aspect
in
this
brew
drinkability
a
quality
beer
imo
but
not
to
my
taste
this
one
is
an
orange
color
mostly
but
not
completely
transparent
with
a
modest
unassuming
head
the
aroma
is
intriguing
spicy
estery
vinous
bits
of
yeast
and
bread
and
a
slight
acidlike
smell
great
the
taste
is
equally
interesting
a
malt
base
around
which
there
is
yeast
apple
flavors
a
fleeting
sourness
and
pepper
the
flavors
work
very
well
and
this
one
is
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
the
intensity
of
flavor
is
sort
of
low
but
the
whole
package
is
noteworthy
and
enjoyable
sprtizy
and
somewhat
light
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
one
at
all
i
must
say
goose
island
did
a
pretty
good
job
i
heard
a
bunch
of
hype
about
this
beer
does
it
live
up
to
all
of
it
probably
not
conversely
this
is
a
good
american
belgian
in
my
opinon
i
did
enjoy
this
and
would
seek
it
out
again
i
had
this
again
5
3
years
later
and
it
was
much
beter
in
the
aroma
departmentyeasty
and
normal
so
upgraded
it
a
different
feel
to
this
one
not
horrible
but
i
can
live
without
ever
having
another
one
americans
benchmark
belgian
pale
ale
taste
spiced
oranges
slight
floral
hops
and
theres
an
interesting
funkyearthiness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
theres
a
little
to
much
bite
in
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
straw
orange
color
with
a
head
that
goes
to
lumps
but
gives
some
lacing
smells
of
sweetmalt
with
a
citric
and
yeast
funk
but
very
mild
taste
kind
of
like
a
witbeer
there
is
a
sourness
but
it
is
more
citrus
than
sour
and
the
hops
are
very
subdued
and
the
yeast
aint
that
funky
nice
carbonation
and
body
though
it
is
drinkable
but
not
the
clone
that
it
could
be
a
rollercoaster
ride
for
sure
and
probably
one
of
the
better
and
more
available
orval
clones
out
there
still
as
many
people
here
said
there
is
something
here
prohibitive
of
greatness
i
dont
know
if
its
a
lack
of
richness
an
excess
of
sweetness
or
a
heavy
hand
with
the
hops
still
id
drink
a
few
more
of
these
without
question
especially
considering
the
hefty
price
tag
to
its
trappist
cousin
drinkability
and
notes

the
more
i
drink
this
the
less
i
taste
the
sour
and
the
more
i
taste
the
hop
bitterness
definitely
a
tasty
beer
but
one
was
enough
for
me
defiantly
feels
like
an
interpretation
of
orval
but
it
doesnt
have
the
same
complexity
of
flavor
pale
dim
orange
big
frothy
meringue
like

the
lace
is
all
coating

i
notice
some
fusels
first
off
on
the
buds
then
some
spicy
peppery
tones
breadiness
is
diminished
on
the
palate
flavor
not
as
full
as
the
nose
predicted
carbonation
is
not
as
lively
as
id
like
just
a
little
underwhelming

or
so
not
bad
not
good

it
mmmm
smooth

very
particular
this
but
altogether
delicious
almost
like
a
saison
just
about
but
so
very
tasty
and
satisfying
lofty
and
lovely
a
keeper
enjoy
when
you
can
dated

consumed
without
aging
i
would
most
definitely
buy
more
of
this
beer
infact
i
prefer
it
to
other
belgian
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
perhaps
this
is
because
this
style
may
have
been
americanized
by
goose
island
perhaps
they
have
decided
to
forego
the
sweet
taste
of
belgian
pale
ales
brewed
in
europe
and
instead
give
it
a
good
mix
of
a
hoppy
and
spicy
character
whatever
the
case
is
i
can
only
say
that
i
prefer
this
brew
to
other
belgian
pale

ive
had
how
many
times
have
i
said
that
now
it
feels
that

might
be
an
accurate
count

this

it
is
an
easy

beer
that
has
lots
of
great
qualities
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
has
more
the
hops
offer
a
nice
balance
and
the
faint
barnyard
quality
of
them
really
makes
this
refreshing
but
not
an
extreme

i
will
be
buying
this
again
soon

the
best

i
have
had
this
year
faint

in
this
orangeamber
beer
topped
by
a
cream
coloured
thin
head
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
but
it
does
show
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
spicy
mostly
with
cloves
but
some
floral
hops
and
cinnamon
peek
through
as
well
the
flavour
is
very
spicy
with

the
way
through

accompanied
by
mild

flavours
as
it
warms
some

becomes
stronger
some

character

lingering

combination

slightly

its
generous
carbonation

a
nice

a

strong
on
the
spiciness
perhaps
but
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
thanks
viggo
this
was
quaffed
rather
easily
and
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
soften
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
at
7
00

this
got
expensive
quick
only
2
50
down

so
delecious
your
likely
to
ignore
its
cost

of
the
two

the

a

enjoyable
sipper

just
on
the
low
side
of
drinkability
due
to
the
yeasty
linger
thanks
ro
brent
for
sending
this
one
along
i
only
wish
this
was
a
more
readily
attainable
beer
as
ive
really
got
a
taste
for
it
now
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
otherwise
but
i
am
still
savouring
my
only
bottle
as
i
wrap
this
review
up
a
nice
orval
homage
here
matilda
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
ivory
froth
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
about
the
glass
in
the
mouth
it
gently
bristles
before
warming
to
become
lightly
creamy
the
nose
is
fruity
with
a
suggestion
of
tartness
think
brettanomcyes
malty
and
a
bit
candyish
a
touch
musty
and
subtly
spicy
all
of
which
carry
over
in
the
flavor
with
the
addition
of
some
welcome
hops
it
finishes
drying
with
some
residual
sticky
malt
but
its
solid
underlying
bitterness
wins
out
in
the
end
and
leaves
you
ready
for
another
sip
well
done
the
finish
was
the
orval
nose
and
astringent
taste
this
was
pleasant
i
will
try
more
i
find
this
beer
to
have
the
flavor
experience
of
bigger
beers
this
is
the
most
interesting
surprise
to
me
at
7
it
borders
on
a
session
beer
it
offers
a
good
food
pairing
and
with
its
citric
carbonation
will
refresh
through
a
meal
the
reserve
series
has
another
success
poured
a
hazy
peachy
gold
some
juicy
fruit
gum
in
the
aroma
very
belgianesque
in
character
yeasty
phenols
and
notoverripe
orchard
fruit
suggesting
pear
and
apple
with
the
barest
touch
of
spice
ive
not
had
an
orval
in
quite
a
while
but
this
beer
immediately
brought
it
to
mind
the
only
flaw
was
in
the
drinkability
but
it
still
went
down
pretty
easily
perhaps
a
bit
more
body
and
silkiness
but
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
it
probably
will
not
appear
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
it
is
pleasantly
drinkable
i
plan
to
do
a
side
by
side
sampling
of
this
one
and
the
beer
that
inspired
it
soon
a
good
albeit
a
little
different
beer
i
need
to
cellar
some
and
see
what
happens
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
moderate
coating
over
top
nose
is
very
nice
i
get
lemoney
and
orange
citrus
slight
musty
and
spiceyness
there
is
almost
a
perfumey
quality
to
it
the
flavor
is
okay
rather
spicey
and
almost
floralperfumey
tasting
as
well
the
citrusyness
is
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
it
seems
to
want
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
things
at
the
same
time
but
they
dont
blend
as
seamlessly
as
i
wouldl
ike
them
to
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
nose
is
really
nice
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
detracting
to
me
id
like
to
see
it
meld
better
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
citrus
and
some
yeasty
character
the
flavor
is
nice
some
citrus
and
a
tasty
caramel
malt
backing
the
flavor
sticks
to
the
tongue
some
yeast
flavors
slightly
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
good
another
great
beer
in
the
line
of
goose
islands
big
beers
good
aromas
of
belgian
candy
and
barley
malts
transfers
to
flavors
along
with
over
ripe
fruits
oranges
plumbs
and
berries
has
some
slight
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
spicy
coriander
cloves
pepper
and
allspice
some
organic
sour
or
earthy
flavors
ride
underneath
other
flavors
these
resemble
trappist
orval
its
a
good
beer
but
the
flavors
need
a
while
to
come
together
draught
this
one
pours
a
dark
golden
somewhat
hazy
color
there
ws
also
a
hint
of
orange
in
there
a
good
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
quite
full
being
bready
yeasty
spicy
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
has
wheat
corriander
breadyness
and
some
sweetness
very
nice
drinkability
is
pretty
high
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
limits
somewhat
but
pretty
good
beer
i
sampled
this
beer
at
goose
island
this
beer
poured
a
rich
mahogany
color
letting
all
light
through
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
malty
smell
with
an
almost
barnyardlike
earthiness
im
guessing
that
was
the
barley
they
were
boasting
of
in
the
written
description
the
taste
was
pretty
complex
without
being
overpowering
the
first
sip
almost
tasted
like
a
chardonnay
crisp
and
fruity
this
taste
was
followed
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
finished
with
a
bitter
hoppy
bite
sour
brettanomyces
driven
first
impression
coated
up
by
bready
soft
malts
also
ripe
fruity
orange
which
goes
well
with
the
sourness
then
dry
noble
hops
hit
the
palate
which
give
the
beer
a
well
balanced
decent
complexity
sweet
molasse
becomes
detectable
for
a
glance
which
soon
gets
swallowed
by
the
hoppy
sourness
this
actually
reminds
me
of
orval
in
some
way
but
adds
a
very
well
fitting
fruit
note
to
the
beer
while
it
isnt
very
aggressive
on
the
hops
leads
to
a
bitter
finish
very
dry
aftertaste
which
dries
up
the
mouth
completely
a
midrange
sour
beer
i
prefer
other
mikkeller
efforts
in
this
style
space
was
appreciated
by
my
friends
who
would
generally
shy
away
from
anything
too
funky
i
might
taste
this
again
down
the
road
to
see
if
the
present
assessment
holds
up
bad
phenolic
off
flavors
just
like
about
50
of
mikkeller
beers
i
try
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
plenty
of
haziness
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
is
on
top
brussels
lacing
i
smell
sour
brett
the
flavor
is
brett
forward
with
a
tart
cherry
note
the
body
is
heavily
carbonated
and
crisp
i
prefer
the
orval
getting
that
out
of
the
way
this
was
indeed
a
nice
belgianstyle
ale
with
nice
saison
characteristics
not
as
funky
as
the
lycheewine
barrel
version
only
one
that
i
tried
pretty
sure
the
others
are
great
too
but
lighter
and
actually
almost
a
different
thing
entirely
100212
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
this
is
a
tongue
twister
team
taste
buds
is
having
issues
with
signals
one
swallow
is
sweetish
the
next
less
so
the
next
not
at
all
never
any
sweet
or
bitterness
but
far
from
all
together
sweet
hate
to
submit
to
the
suggestion
but
it
does
strike
me
as
an
organicevolving
taste
all
this
wa
funky
finish
cant
imagine
what
a
bottle
gets
you
i
should
also
note
that
because
there
is
no
bottling
date
im
not
sure
how
old
this
is
i
feel
like
age
may
account
for
some
of
the
shortcomings
still
great
beer
here
but
unfortunately
i
think
i
enjoy
the
many
variations
far
more
than
the
original
here
this
is
more
of
a
belgian
than
the
others
and
as
such
the
brett
comes
through
a
lot
less
the
ak
alive
version
i
thought
was
the
supreme
wild
ale
a
perfect
example
of
dryness
and
brett
character
while
its
alive
here
is
just
a
bit
more
generic
as
they
go
hazy
rust
colored
liquid
maybe
a
touch
lighter
than
that
with
a
prominent
several
inches
of
cream
colored
fluff
it
smells
like
belgian
yeast
first
orchard
fruit
esters
and
dusty
grain
ith
some
amber
malt
sweetness
the
brett
is
really
only
on
the
finish
for
me
not
super
dry
or
effervescent
but
farmy
more
like
a
belgian
saison
here
than
a
true
wild
ale
as
i
have
come
to
know
them
from
mikkeller
but
i
like
it
a
lot
just
the
same
the
brett
pushes
the
denser
grain
to
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
where
its
sweetness
is
balanced
nicely
the
diversity
of
yeasts
and
yeast
characters
make
this
beer
unique
and
special
but
i
just
dont
find
the
complexity
or
wonderment
i
discovered
in
all
the
variations
of
it
great
carbonation
and
a
lof
of
body
still
very
well
made
beer
but
i
would
take
ak
alive
over
this
one
any
day
2011
bottle
that
i
split
with
scotchzi
pours
a
perfect

healthy
amount
of
light

with
very
sticky

aroma
is
a
funky
butterscotch
toffee
earthy
really
great
smell
taste
is
more
funky
than
the
aroma
but
otherwise
follows
the
smell
great
carbonation
lends
to
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
light
in
body
but
it
works
very
very
well
for
this
beer
definitely
looking
forward
to
the
variants
i
have

this

it

notes
this
beer
was
aged
on

im
not

what
they
were
going
for
but
i
like
sour

on
the

im
getting

aging

a
slight
buttery

theres
everything

flavor

bitter

a

and

some
people
would
say
cat

but
i
dont
find
it
offensive
in
the
least
regards
i
find
hints
of
sliced
green
apple
plump
raisins
and
other
fine
infused
tart
characteristics
this
is
probably
my
favorite
mikkeller
thus
far
i
find
hit
or
miss
to
be
their
game
but
this
is
dead
on
for
a
beer
called
its
alive
im
a
fan
of
their
de
proef
gypsy
brewed
offerings
ive
had
limited
contact
with
their
hoppy
ales
but
have
found
them
to
be
lackluster
compared
to
most
american
brewed
versions
mouthfeel
upfront
has
a
rolling
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
with
acidity
and
sharp
dry
finish
but
the
mix
of
carbonation
and
dry
character
seems
to
treat
the
beer
superbly
on
the
palate
overall
what
can
i
say
that
i
didnt
already
go
try
this
brew
mo
throughout
the
drink
the
mouthfeel
remains
softly
refreshing
with
rather
decent
and
subtle
carbonation
against
a
mediumplus
body
of
orvallike
flavour
profile
the
attenuation
level
is
not
quite
as
high
as
the
original
nor
is
the
funky
bretts
performance
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
belgian
ale
with
layers
of
flavours
and
aroma
to
offer
4

d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
smoothness
having
not
had
something
like
this
before
its
difficult
to
compare
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
taste
profile
is
a
very
well
integrated
mix
of
belgian
ale
and
wine
cant
find
much
to
complain
about
here
overall
a
good
beer
a
lot
like
champagne
not
the
best
but
worth
having
the
shelf
talkers
for
this
beer
at
bevmo
said
that
this
is
orvalinspired
i
can
kinda
see
that
but
this
is
definitely
its
own
animal
overall
simple
flavors
i
like
the
balance
of
this
right
now
would
probably
be
way
too
bretty
with
age
d
well
balanced
bspa
great
brett
character
nice
and
easy
drinking
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
really
earthy
im
thinking
the
brett
really
lent
this
quality
to
the
beer
that
would
have
otherwise
been
just
another
hoppy
pale
really
interesting
but
not
necessarily
memorable

the
taste
was
a

odd
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
nicely
complex
and
smooth
to
sip
on
enjoyed
this
quite
a

despite
low

well
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
mikkeller
fanboy
like
i
o
not
great
not
bad
also
not
worth
the
price
though
this
is
really
strange
its
lightly
sweet
lightly
fruity
lightly
funky
definitely
phenolic
and
watery
its
doesnt
really
make
sense
to
list
this
as
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
i
guess
it
doesnt
really
fit
into
any
categories
overall
unique
to
say
the
least
belgian
yeast
layered
over
a
pronounced
brettanomyces
funkiness
is
just
crazy
not
sour
not
really
funky
not
belgian
this
is
a
beer
made
of
nots
because
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is
this
is
medium
bodied
this
might
be
passed
its
prime
im
not
sure
how
wild
i
am
about
mikkellers
wild
ales
in
general
the
body
is
light
with
slightly
low
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
okay
a
little
messy
overall
but
this
one
is
drinkable
thanks
to
thebishopco
for
this
one
this
should
definitely
be
listed
as
an
american
wild
ale
pretty
complex
and
unique
but
deeper
and
richerstickier
than
a
bspa
o
this
is
an
interesting
strong
ale
with
its
overpowering
wild
yeast
character
it
should
please
fans
of
lambics
american
wild
ales
and
the
funkier
yeastier
saisons
a
very
solid
offering
cheers
notes
something
away
from
orval
or
those
i
have
had
in
some
malt
sweetcaramel
sense
but
rather
nice
and
memorable
a
nice
beer
with
lots
and
lots
of
funk
i
feel
like
it
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
and
is
a
little
one
dimensional
in
terms
of
the
funk
but
that
is
what
you
get
from
brett
d
good
beer
but
only
the
frame
work
of
orval
lacks
finesse
but
is
drinkable
it
is
merely
a
shadow
of
the
beer
it
is
imitating
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
not
worth
15
but
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
that
out
looks
great
but
perhaps
it
needs
some
age
or
something
i
remember
loving
usalive
this
ones
not
as
impressive
overall
damn
tasty
funky
pale
ale
that
in
my
opinion
comes
close
to
a
saisonfarmhouse
in
style
maybe
even
more
so
than
a
pale
ale
easy
drinker
that
i
could
post
up
on
all
night
o
i
was
drawn
to
this
beer
by
its
stark
label
dont
regret
buying
it
and
trying
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
ever
again
a
mediocre
base
beer
with
an
overly
funky
character
as
it
sits
the
funkiness
mellows
a
bit
or
your
taste
buds
simply
get
used
to
it
but
the
beer
really
touts
its
wild
side
while
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
entire
bottle
i
dont
know
that
i
would
ever
seek
it
out
again
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
the
unadventurous
and
it
seems
a
little
one
dimensional
however
if
you
enjoy
wild
ales
you
should
really
pick
this
one
up
at
least
once
this
drinks
really
easy
if
you
are
into
brett
a
nice
take
on
the
style
albeit
a
touch
pricey
b
o
my
first
wild
ale
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
hard
to
pinpoint
the
exact
flavors
and
aromas
but
truly
enjoyable
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
of
this
interesting
variety
its
alive
will
be
frequently
enjoyed
in
my
house
wow
one
of
the
funkiest
aromas
ive
ever
come
across
from
a
beer
the
taste
followed
the
nose
only
way
less
funk
the
funk
almost
rounds
out
the
flavors
very
good
especially
if
you
like
funky
brews
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
some
aged
cranberry
white
cheddar
seems
a
bit
underrated
to
me
but
then
again
im
not
really
a
funky
kinda
guy
if
you
know
what
i
mean
750ml
cellered
for
a
good
while
thanks
to
gregus
mikkeller
is
alway
expensive
but
pretty
much
alway
unique
and
good
clear
amberish
color
amazing
looking
head
frothy
and
solid
looking
like
wax
i
walked
away
for
20
minutes
and
came
back
to
the
head
still
holding
like
a
champ
and
lacing
still
clinging
this
beer
has
great
visual
appeal
smell
is
an
appealing
but
very
delicate
aroma
i
smell
flowers
and
bright
acidic
yeast
not
what
i
was
expecting
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
subtle
malt
notes
minimal
hopping
seems
like
the
recipe
is
designed
to
push
the
yeast
character
which
is
complex
and
exciting
to
the
palate
ph
is
low
and
puckers
the
lips
a
bit
thin
body
booze
is
quite
well
hidden
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
sour
but
wonderful
beer
pleasure
to
have
tried
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
very
much
but
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
i
dont
know
where
this
beers
horrible
reviews
came
from
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
at
the
down
south
beer
tasting
while
aasher
was
in
town
to
visit
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
orange
rine
fruit
banana
and
subtle
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sugar
wheat
banana
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
there
was
just
something
about
this
one
that
was
a
little
offputting
in
the
flavor
maybe
it
was
the
way
the
sugar
blended
with
the
fruits
present
who
knows
but
this
could
have
been
a
lot
better
if
this
were
not
the
case
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
that
is
about
it
o
i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
to
it
reminds
me
of
the
bbb
from
fantome
but
a
little
richer
good
beer
and
i
am
now
a
mikkeller
fan
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
so
i
have
no
idea
where
to
write
this
review
i
found
this
bottle
just
recently
but
it
is
in
a
750ml
bottle
and
labeled
as
a
belgian
wild
ale
i
thought
it
may
be
the
its
alive
that
is
not
retired
but
the
abv
is
off
and
there
are
no
750ml
bottle
reviews
so
im
very
confused
so
anyways
pours
an
almostclear
golden
amber
color
with
a
huge
beautiful
frothy
creamcolored
head
scent
is
a
bit
of
brett
with
some
sugary
sweetness
to
it
lots
of
pepper
and
spiciness
to
it
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
and
citrus
orange
peel
taste
is
initially
citrusy
with
hints
of
funk
from
the
brett
not
as
funky
as
i
was
expecting
has
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
sugar
cane
then
i
some
lemon
tartness
that
finishes
sweet
and
bretty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
crisp
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
can
definitely
see
how
people
would
compare
this
beer
to
orval
but
imo
it
cant
compete
in
fact
any
beer
that
is
a
tribute
to
orval
cant
compare
this
one
may
be
the
closest
though
pours
a
rich
burnished
brown
leather
with
a
ridiculously
frothy
massive
head
leaving
thick
chunks
of
foam
on
the
glass
as
it
ever
so
slowly
dissipates
the
nose
has
bright
sour
citrus
red
fruit
a
touch
of
pleasant
funk
along
with
belgian
spices
the
taste
brings
sour
raspberry
lemon
along
with
clove
and
almost
a
touch
of
banana
very
light
sourness
and
funk
tasty
stuff
i
did
find
it
to
seem
a
bit
diluted
at
this
abv
though
i
was
highly
impressed
with
the
look
and
taste
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
bronzed
amber
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
head
smells
of
yeast
citrus
zest
and
bubblegum
sweet
taste
pale
malts
very
citrusy
pear
pineapple
and
a
bit
of
hay
some
hop
bitterness
coming
through
but
not
much
almost
saisonish
very
complex
and
enjoyable
array
of
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
mdo
medium
bodied
lots
of
carb
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
very
wide
appeal
a
delicious
beer
with
good
balance
a
great
introduction
to
the
saison
style
for
newbies
o
this
makes
me
think
of
the
typical
run
of
the
mill
amber
ale
with
a
bit
of
oak
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
hops
and
more
brett
d
a
solidly
made
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
pours
a
pretty
slightly
dark
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
very
thick
buttery
offwhite
head
the
bottle
i
got
fizzed
like
nobodys
business
so
have
a
towel
handy
aroma
is
average
strength
fruity
yeasty
and
somewhat
sweet
with
a
malty
hint
flavor
is
mainly
fruity
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
has
malt
and
yeast
hints
plus
just
a
bit
of
butterscotch
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
leaving
a
rather
persistent
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
lips
light
and
fluffy
the
beer
itself
is
a
light
yellow
amber
smells
are
pretty
plain
but
pleasant
very
light
fruits
citrus
bread
and
thick
floral
smells
the
taste
is
that
same
collection
of
smells
after
they
go
to
funk
danceoff
very
wild
and
bretty
i
think
the
taste
takes
a
hit
with
the
body
those
notes
get
lost
a
little
bit
in
the
ensuing
explosion
in
your
mouth
still
very
fun
to
drink
and
maybe
even
more
to
pour
cheers
overall
this
is
only
my
second
of
mikkelers
beers
and
i
like
it
its
not
spectacular
but
its
still
pretty
good
im
still
new
to
wild
beers
so
the
restrained
brett
character
lack
of
acidity
etc
was
easy
for
my
palate
to
appreciate
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
know
if
i
wouldve
paid
for
a
bottle
of
this
given
how
expensive
mikkeler
products
are
on
tap
it
was
fairly
priced
cheers
overall
a
good
but
not
great
wild
ale
for
me
not
many
wild
ales
choices
here
in
tx
but
for
17
99
it
would
need
to
be
a
lot
more
rememorable
before
id
buy
another
no
d
this
owes
more
than
a
little
debt
to
orval
but
its
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
bspa
incredibly
easy
to
put
down
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
crazy
amount
of
foam
that
fills
the
glass
immediately
excellent
head
retention
smell
tart
sour
musty
green
apples
taste
dissapointing
not
much
here
not
bad
by
any
means
flat
apple
juice
some
bitter
funk
from
the
brett
boring
bland
but
i
guess
highly
drinkable
since
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
anything
the
store
owner
advised
me
against
this
one
and
i
didnt
listen
oh
well
could
have
spent
14
bucks
worse
ways
than
this
mikkeller
dissapoints
here
for
sure
there
are
some
redeemable
things
about
this
beer
but
on
the
whole
it
was
just
ok
im
really
tempted
to
drain
pour
it
not
because
its
not
palateable
but
because
i
was
expecting
something
much
better
and
much
different
and
i
didnt
get
it
drinkable
ya
edgy
hops
neutered
yeast
and
underwhelming
malt
you
betcha
enjoyable
enough
to
warrant
the
price
the
jurys
still
out
d
easy
to
drink
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
mikkeller
does
not
dissapoint
d
beers
like
this
tend
to
go
down
quickly
as
there
not
rich
and
filling
but
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
it
was
good
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
surprised
to
learn
that
this
beer
is
retired
i
just
had
this
on
tap
at
churchkey
in
washington
dc
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
beer
was
served
at
almost
room
temperature
which
is
the
norm
at
churchkey
pours
pale
coppery
amber
with
a
lovely
medium
staying
creamy
white
head
but
then
fizzles
quickly
retains
nice
lacing
throughout
however
picking
up
some
funky
aroma
bread
grapes
oak
and
floral
notes
light
vinious
high
prickly
carbonation
fine
dry
and
mild
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
quite
mild
some
sugary
grapelike
sweetness
and
esters
vinious
and
warming
good
fresh
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
finish
as
well
d
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
now
that
this
one
is
retired
this
beer
pours
like
the
muddy
creek
out
back
it
looks
like
dark
murky
muddy
water
with
an
off
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
beautifully
it
smells
great
its
tart
its
sour
and
it
has
this
light
fresh
fruitylike
sweetness
that
rounds
it
out
i
know
this
beer
hasnt
been
made
in
a
little
while
but
it
could
be
more
it
could
be
more
tart
it
could
bolder
it
could
be
more
fruity
it
could
be
more
sour
i
would
guess
id
rate
this
an
a
if
fresh
but
right
now
i
cant
do
it
some
sours
get
stronger
with
age
this
one
lessens
its
tart
but
not
tart
enough
it
drinks
smoothly
enough
but
its
not
what
it
could
be
its
drinkable
but
not
overly
so
this
beer
im
sure
could
be
better
regardless
im
glad
i
could
try
it
decent
nothing
great
i
enjoyed
their
yeast
series
brett
more
than
this
one
but
they
are
different
beers
entirely
d
fairly
neutral
for
a
wild
ale
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
punch
but
what
i
got
out
of
this
was
another
tasty
brew
from
mikkeller
anyways
i
want
to
buy
the
store
out
of
these
this
beer
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
me
after
the
initial
tasting
i
finished
the
bottle
with
a
farmers
market
meal
of
halved
and
browned
brussel
sprouts
with
salt
and
olive
oil
artichokes
with
salt
and
olive
oil
faro
mustard
greens
with
sautéed
oyster
mushrooms
garlic
and
caramelized
red
onion
i
felt
like
i
was
having
a
kings
feast
this
has
tied
maudite
for
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
my
personal
taste
skål
d
this
was
a
great
wild
ale
that
was
delicate
and
complex
and
very
clean
it
wasnt
too
funky
as
the
brett
was
well
integrated
and
balanced
body
was
decent
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
great
brew
fresh
that
may
improve
with
age
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
m
d
nice
feel
with
a
good
brett
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
prevalent
brett
aroma
and
taste
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
is
sour
there
is
no
pucker
or
tartness
in
the
flavor
or
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
id
drink
it
again
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
beer
whos
sweet
malt
overshadows
the
brett
if
i
had
a
bottle
i
would
age
it
6
to
12
months
to
allow
the
brett
character
to
develop
i
guess
thats
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
this
from
being
exceptional
it
didnt
have
layers
of
things
going
on
of
course
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
its
alive
is
pretty
drinkable
its
a
filling
beer
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
i
think
it
would
sit
too
heavy
there
is
a
good
amount
of
funkit
isnt
limiting
at
all
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
floral
slight
citrus
slight
spice
and
hint
of
tart
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
grass
slight
wheat
slight
tart
malt
slight
floral
sweet
malt
and
hops
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
no
one
thing
stood
out
as
exceptional
still
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
orval
give
this
a
shot
to
just
compare
the
two
if
you
dont
know
orval
skip
it
im
noticing
a
trend
of
higher
abv
amber
belgian
styles
that
im
not
crazy
about
the
alcohol
is
too
hot
the
flavors
muddled
not
crazy
about
it
this
is
right
in
line
with
those
characteristics
there
are
some
interesting
things
going
on
but
they
dont
outweigh
the
toll
that
this
takes
on
your
palate
sobriety
kind
of
disappointing
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
soft
fluffy
head
that
lasted
for
a
good
while
left
a
lot
of
lacing
behind
with
each
sip
smell
was
good
i
picked
up
spices
mainly
pepper
and
citrus
fruit
there
was
also
something
funky
in
the
nose
too
ive
smelt
it
with
other
beers
of
this
type
but
i
cant
really
place
what
it
is
it
reminds
me
of
the
stables
at
the
horse
track
the
taste
was
on
par
with
the
smell
spicy
and
peppery
with
a
nice
citrus
fruit
character
the
funk
was
present
in
the
taste
also
but
not
near
as
apparent
i
swear
i
tasted
watermelon
in
there
too
mouthfeel
was
full
and
it
left
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tounge
very
drinkable
and
hides
its
alcohol
well
d
its
alive
drinks
well
and
is
a
satisying
brew
but
not
the
mouthkiller
i
expected
id
buy
it
again
but
not
for
18
drinks
pretty
well
as
far
as
not
finding
the
alcohol
much
the
semiharsh
finish
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
quaff
though
a
solid
offering
from
mikkeller
and
definitely
a
beer
to
think
about
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
their
answer
to
orval
well
those
are
tough
shoes
to
fill
check
this
one
out
though
d
honestly
if
you
like
your
hops
this
is
very
easy
drinking
the
brettfunk
that
turns
some
people
off
is
not
dominating
so
its
really
just
a
matter
of
liking
the
dryness
the
abv
is
not
obvious
so
a
750ml
bottle
per
person
is
too
easy
pours
with
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
two
or
three
fingers
of
sticky
belgian
lace
aroma
is
sour
apple
and
fresh
sourdough
bread
very
dry
and
funky
with
sparkling
carbonation
bursts
of
brettanomyces
yeast
come
through
now
and
again
bringing
notes
of
leather
and
hay
astringent
hops
complete
the
grainy
finish
a
refreshing
straightforward
wild
ale
on
par
with
many
of
the
classics
of
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
copper
orange
with
spare
head
but
much
more
heavu
in
the
lacing
delicious
and
lively
but
very
flat
at
the
same
time
bit
of
a
funky
hay
flavor
very
cloudy
but
lively
carbonation
is
still
very
noticable
medium
body
with
a
sticky
oily
texture
slightly
bitter
to
the
finish
over
all
very
good
beer
but
dont
let
the
smell
fool
you
the
taste
doesnt
quite
follow
through
d
very
easy
drinker
glad
i
tried
it
wow
what
a
brew
poured
with
a
nice
small
in
a
small
sample
glass
off
white
head
and
a
little
lace
aroma
is
an
incredible
floral
with
yeast
malt
and
some
hop
flavors
about
the
same
with
massive
malt
and
a
little
earthiness
great
chewy
body
and
carbonation
color
is
a
copper
amber
finish
is
like
flavor
deliscious
brett
adds
a
lot
to
the
the
beer
with
the
flavor
and
edge
could
even
be
a
session
for
slow
drinking
this
is
another
hit
form
mikkeller
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
they
are
certainly
one
of
the
true
innovators
of
the
brewing
industry
d
for
the
style
a
fun
and
very
drinkable
beer
verdict
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
falls
a
little
short
in
the
flavorintensity
department
think
of
this
as
orval
with
training
wheels
pours
a
big
foamy
offwhite
head
semiturbid
body
dark
amber
in
color
creamy
head
good
lacing
almost
like
melted
ice
cream
very
hoppy
sour

sweet
sour
aroma
dry
and
grapefruity
chewy
taste
some
nutty
biscuitiness
light
taste
bitter
and
sour
but
not
hoppy
tasting
was
expecting
more
hops
slight
sour
taste
and
something
else
cant
taste
the
alcohol
not
a
fan
not
much
taste
finally
decided
to
crack
this
brew
after
it
has
been
sitting
in
my
collection
for
a
while
now
and
must
admit
i
had
forgot
about
it
anyways
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
with
decent
carbbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
head
and
some
lacing
here
and
therethe
aroma
is
candied
fruit
and
alcohol
infused
toffeeit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
boiled
candytoffeedried
fruits
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
edge
to
mash
the
sweet
and
sour
tastes
perfectlyoverall
a
nice
beer
indeed
thats
very
easy
to
drink
but
cos
ive
been
spoiled
by
this
brewer
i
know
he
can
do
better
although
it
is
a
nice
drop
glowing
and
cloudy
amber
orange
with
murky
sediment
in
the
body
and
golden
highlights
on
the
edges
two
fingers
of
foamy
bubbly
white
head
that
holds
up
quite
well
a
few
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
strong
and
pungent
phenolic
aroma
equal
parts
plastic
and
dried

some

anjou
pears
and
winelike
grape
skin
with
a
bit
of
cedar
and
mildly
dry
bitterness
from
the
hops
boozy
warming
finish
gives
off
a
medicinal
flavour
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
mediumbodied
clean
and
peppery
not
much
aftertaste
great
beer
to
savour
over
the
course
of
an
evening
d
im
going
to
enjoy
this
entire
bottle
quite
thoroughly
tonight
i
liked
this
well
enough
however
at
12
50
a
bottle
its
not
likely
something
ill
pick
up
too
often
dat
first
the
beer
isnt
easy
to
drink
period
but
as
it
warms
the
beer
becomes
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
highly
suggest
buying
some
if
you
can
find
it
im
so
glad
for
my
friend
jason
who
hooked
me
up
with
this
beer
for
my
birthday
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
an
excellent
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
some
yeast
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
the
taste
us
decent
as
well
it
has
a
crisp
pale
and
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
a
dry
earthy
farmhouse
funk
the
brett
character
provides
a
mild
sourness
but
mostly
a
dry
earthy
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
got
bad
reviews
but
its
actually
quite
enjoyable
im
not
sure
its
true
to
style
but
it
has
good
malt
and
yeast
character
drinkability
try
as
i
might
i
just
cannot
get
past
the
finish
in
this
schizophrenic
beer
mikkeller
is
really
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
us
or
abroad
this
is
some
amazing
stuff
not
for
everyone
fine
by
me
gimme
some
more
very
yeast
medium
body
with
slight
roasted
malt
peppery
spiciness
and
a
sourtart
earthy
dry
finish
there
is
some
slight
crisp
light
fruit
character
but
this
is
overpowered
by
the
funky
tart
brett
flavor
notes
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
but
the
struise
mikkeller
eliot
brew
remains
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
to
date
in
the
end
im
not
sure
how
i
fully
feel
about
this
stuff
its
decent
in
its
seperate
aspects
but
the
way
it
all
comes
together
doesnt
completely
gel
with
me
an
earthy
ale
thats
fore
sure
but
not
necessarily
something
my
palate
wants
to
return
to
very
tasty
beermore
of
a
saison
with
light
brett
than
anything
else
though
the
hops
taste
american
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
funkiness
with
some
fruit
mixed
in
no
real
hops
on
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
where
the
funkiness
comes
in
it
is
not
as
sour
or
wild
as
some
other
beers
but
the
flavor
is
definitely
there
once
the
beer
has
warmed
up
by
the
time
i
finished
my
beer
it
had
been
out
of
the
fridge
for
over
and
hour
and
was
very
good
there
are
also
some
hops
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
slight
fruitiness
a
very
good
beer
not
too
sour
or
funky
but
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
that
i
hope
to
try
again
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
certainly
drink
it
again
opinion
well
this
beer
falls
short
of
what
i
would
classify
as
a
wild
ale
as
i
mentioned
in
my
review
it
seems
more
to
me
of
an
oak
aged
iipa
than
a
wild
ale
unfortunately
it
even
falls
short
a
bit
for
an
oak
aged
iipa
it
is
an
alright
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
trying
again
after
i
drink
this
whole
750ml
myself
drinkability
id
almost
have
this
again
lol
not
quite
that
funk
still
doesnt
quite
pass
muster
on
the
rebuy
option
but
this
was
reasonably
drinkable
interesting
mouthfeel
fizzes
up
a
bit
when
it
hits
the
tongue
but
then
becomes
very
silky
and
smooth
medium
body
has
a
crisp
carbonation
and
is
quite
refreshing
nothing
like
orval
but
still
a
very
nice
ale
this
brew
pours
up
a
murky
apricot
color
with
a
nice
white
head
verrrry
nice
lacing
mi
amigo
the
nose
is
hops
straight
up
floral
hops
dominate
a
little
funky
some
light
fruits
subtle
light
raspberry
apricots
i
taste
hops
again
dry
earthy
character
brett
very
light
fruits
a
pretty
dry
brew
medium
to
full
bodied
low
to
medium
carbo
quite
alright
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
served
in
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
copperbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
aroma
is
mostly
fruity
but
also
a
bit
light
it
smells
like
tart
apples
vinegar
funk
peppery
spice
and
some
pears
unfortunately
a
lot
of
that
doesnt
come
out
in
the
taste
it
tastes
like
some
bready
malt
yeast
peppery
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
tart
fruit
theres
also
a
bitter
finish
but
something
just
seems
a
little
bit
off
about
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
has
moderate
and
soft
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
smooth
and
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
75cl
bottle
pours
kind
of
a
nasty
yellowbrown
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
sweet
yeasty
smell
brown
sugar
and
some
very
light
brett
character
faintly
fruity
not
very
pleasant
very
yeasty
taste
again
fairly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
fruit
very
restrained
brett
notes
hops
evident
toward
the
end
lightmedium
body
an
underwhelming
take
on
this
style
that
i
really
just
dont
want
to
drink
much
of
i
know
i
have
said
this
with
a
number
of
reviews
but
for
the
price
this
beer
should
be
passed
over
very
good
beer
for
the
style
but
seems
to
be
about
twice
the
price
of
some
of
its
competitors
overall
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
delivered
it
quite
nicely
i
would
not
have
a
problem
going
for
this
one
again
but
maybe
after
it
has
a
couple
of
years
on
in
it
i
will
look
to
try
again
as
i
think
theres
promise
in
the
balance
and
subtle
brett
character
i
am
kind
of
at
odds
with
this
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
really
special
all
in
all
i
have
had
better
brett
beers
it
is
worth
a
try
though
i
also
expected
the
brett
to
play
more
of
a
role
but
perhaps
that
will
come
with
a
little
more
age
an
overall
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
light
bitter
finish
not
what
i
was
expecting
tasted
a
bit
like
an
english
barleywine
to
me
still
very
good
beer
well
im
impressed
this
beer
is
basically
american
in
its
scope
and
ambition
this
is
not
surprising
coming
from
mikkeller
and
deproef
though
as
both
are
among
the
more
experimental
european
brewers
im
finishing
this
750ml
bottle
in
no
time
and
filing
this
beer
under
right
up
my
alley
this
is
tasty
tasty
stuff
and
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
poured
a
hazy
auburn
with
a
big
fat
foamy
white
head
good
lacing
funky
spicy
aroma
sweeter
fruity
yeast
rather
than
the
barnyard
variety
malt
sweetness
as
well
mixed
with
apples
and
melon
effervescent
mouthfeel
kind
of
velvety
dry
finish
fruity
taste
again
with
green
apples
and
now
peach
some
pepper
spice
aiwht
maybe
clove
but
not
the
clove
that
may
be
found
in
a
german
hefe
a
bit
sharper
sweet
yeast
funk
as
well
some
breaddough
malt
from
time
to
time
easy
to
drink
but
one
bottle
was
my
max
d
i
couldnt
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
but
well
every
once
in
a
while
this
is
a
perfect
tasting
beer
d
an
interesting
beer
indeed
not
quite
a
belgian
wild
ale
like
the
label
suggests
but
certainly
different
to
most
bspa
a
brettified
belgian
ipa
anyway
well
worth
a
try
d
it
goes
down
decently
well
especially
for
the
abv
probably
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
but
it
was
something
that
i
was
glad
i
tried
drinks
very
well
at
8
00
while
not
being
what
i
could
call
smooth
pours
a
redorange
with
good
amounts
of
head
bottle
was
filled
all
the
way
up
to
the
bottom
of
the
cork
aroma
is
a
little
acrid
and
slightly
sour
reminds
me
of
a
drier
white
wine
mixed
with
beer
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
reading
the
bottle
this
makes
much
more
sense
when
listed
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
as
a
wild
ale
it
tastes
like
a
hybrid
in
style
not
sour
enough
to
really
be
a
wild
ale
but
too
acrid
to
be
a
strong
ale
not
a
terrible
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
though
i
am
not
impressed
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
if
you
like
orval
youll
definitely
like
this
well
worth
a
try
bottle
poured
a
shiny
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
is
very
interesting
with
nice
belgian
style
malt
and
a
slightly
dry
hoppy
finish
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
fruity
ester
with
some
belgian
style
malt
with
some
lingering
sweetness
and
some
very
light
poppering
style
hops
at
the
end
full
body
with
great
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
the
alcohol
very
well
done
though
not
very
close
to
orval
as
suggested
by
the
label
overall
very
funky
and
unusual
hard
to
evaluate
but
definitely
worth
at
least
one
try
drinkability
is
pretty
terrible
its
not
revolting
but
its
definitely
not
something
id
look
forward
to
m
d
slightly
sparkling
but
it
could
be
a
bit
richer
really
modest
but
medium
body
quite
smooth
as
mentioned
above
the
flavours
and
aroma
opens
up
very
nicely
with
time
so
it
is
good
to
allow
it
to
breathe
and
open
up
drinkability
a
fantastic
bottle
to
split
with
friends
we
all
got
weird
things
from
this
probably
due
to
the
yeast
and
the
brett
overall
though
its
missing
some
good
prominent
funk
we
were
all
hoping
for
i
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
but
its
such
a
different
and
exciting
brew
that
its
nice
to
see
the
responses
of
others
also
with
some
tweaking
in
the
future
this
could
be
amazing
stuff
but
right
now
for
the
price
id
stick
to
spitting
the
cost
around
1214
in
my
area
with
a
few
friends
d
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
a
wellcrafted
ipa
except
that
the
label
calls
it
a
belgian
wild
ale
so
much
for
trying
to
categorize
beer
i
suppose
i
had
a
really
tough
time
picking
out
the
brett
here
try
as
i
might
i
couldnt
pick
up
any
funk
nate
from
gordons
recommended
that
i
get
two
bottles
of
this
one
to
drink
now
and
one
to
cellar
so
well
see
what
happens
with
the
other
one
after
a
while
somewhat
tame
for
a
wild
ale
but
it
still
has
the
same
complexities
very
drinkable
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
recommended
comparisons
to
orval
come
to
mind
but
this
beer
takes
on
a
more
caramel
flavor
and
not
as
aggressive
with
the
wild
character
still
musty
horsey
and
dusty
throughout
even
the
dryhopped
character
of
the
beer
draws
comparisons
d
wild
and
funky
but
overall
well
done
and
toned
a
sour
citrusy
belgian
pale
good
for
a
single
serving
bomber
but
not
intriquing
enough
to
warrant
repeatability
or
future
purchase
one
try
is
suffice
and
only
moderate
when
compared
to
their
other
fantastic
beers
they
brew
a
750ml
corked
bottle
split
with
psycohops
poured
into
twin
shaker
glasses
the
ale
appears
akin
to
murky
iced
tea
with
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
the
head
settles
to
a
thin
layer
as
it
warms
nose
and
taste
spoiling
tart
apples
mild
funk
candied
apples
smarties
candies
super
dry
and
bitter
d
one
750ml
is
more
than
enough
for
me
on
this
one
it
is
ridiculously
complex
yet
only
somewhat
flavorful
nothing
quite
makes
me
say
dude
take
another
drink
this
is
amazing
its
more
like
take
another
drink
did
you
really
taste
that
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
wants
to
challenge
their
palate
this
one
is
a
workout
almost
to
the
point
of
being
annoying
still
good
but
wow
burnt
orange
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
beer
has
a
malty
aroma
with
citrus
and
some
mild
brett
funk
taste
is
very
similar
with
a
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
sour
and
dry
alcohol
is
well
masked
the
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
and
as
i
drunk
it
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
overall
d
the
heft
of
the
8
alcohol
never
gets
in
the
way
allowing
the
funk
to
shine
through
another
danish
standout
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
mixed
for
me
while
it
was
and
enjoyable
break
from
what
i
am
used
to
i
wouldnt
come
back
for
this
again
drinkability
this
wild
ale
is
a
slow
sipper
nice
flavor
but
one
bottle
will
be
enough
in
a
session
d
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
belgianstyle
pale
ale
it
tasted
nothing
like
it
smelled
but
it
was
very
good
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
not
a
problem
to
finish
the
1
pt
9
4
fl
oz
bottle
but
im
not
craving
more
from
there
ok
as
a
session
brew
but
it
needs
more
of
the
sour
d
i
dunno
i
kinda
got
used
to
it
by
the
end
but
i
cant
really
say
it
was
pleasant
and
i
wanted
to
open
another
my
cat
jingle
loved
it
the
aroma
is
wild
and
funky
there
is
pepper
and
ginger
as
well
as
sour
fruit
malt
herbs
and
cedar
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
huge
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
not
overly
funky
the
palate
is
thin
overall
not
bad
for
a
wild
beer
its
more
than
i
expected
overall
once
i
put
the
anticipated
taste
aside
the
beer
definitely
became
more
drinkable
still
given
the
price
tag
on
this
beer
i
would
probably
not
buy
it
again
d
shows
great
complexity
and
weak
balance
the
funk
is
fantastic
but
even
a
sucker
like
me
would
love
to
see
some
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
huge
funk
fun
but
not
overly
drinkable
pours
a
very
deep
translucent
copper
amber
hue
what
an
awesome
thick
dense
sticky
head
spongey
and
very
light
tan
in
color
but
very
small
and
slow
lacing
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
the
produce
aisle
at
my
local
grocery
store
dominicks
more
specifically
like
when
you
bury
your
nose
in
th
apple
display
particularly
green
apples
very
yeasty
fruity
taste
unsweetend
apple
sauce
and
caramel
malts
the
apples
and
caramel
slowly
move
to
a
smokey
toasted
malt
hints
of
tandy
leather
give
an
earthy
hop
finish
not
as
funky
as
expected
but
pretty
hoppy
and
earthy
saddle
leather
palate
earthy
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
8
abv
you
would
never
guess
the
abv
without
looking
at
the
bottle
d
no
thanks
ill
pass
d
no
thank
you
sir
if
every
sip
tasted
like
the
first
this
would
be
a
solid
beer
but
this
unfortunately
did
not
happen
not
very
drinkable
just
not
my
favorite
very
drinkable
people
put
this
down
very
easily
and
wanted
more
thats
a
good
sign
my
expectations
where
met
with
another
of
my
top
active
bottled
beers
for
style
drinkability

easy
to
kick
back

be
sipped

thrown
back
amber
colored

i
got
a
lot
of

in
it
as
well
as
some
earthy
notes
and
some
spices
taste
unfortunately
did
not
have
as
much
of
the
horse
blanket
or
much
of
what
i
find
enjoyable
best
thing
to
describe
it
was
like
vicks
green
cough
spray
i
wanted
to
like
the
taste
better
but
i
just
kept
being
distracted
by
this
flavor
medium

high
carbonation
dont
know
that
id
have
this
again

just
not
really
fitting
into

this
one
had
a
gigantic
frothy
beige
head
that
produced
big
chunky
clumps
of
lacing
semiclear
and
a
redamber
colour
the
aroma
was
full
of
hops
of
the
floralsoapy
variety
and
there
was
a
bit
of
fruity
tartness
some
sweetness
and
faint
earthy
funk
perfume
and
jasmine
bitterness
was
a
bit
assertive
but
still
nicely
balanced
the
flavour
was
very
floral
and
perfumy
with
many
of
the
same
characters
that
were
in
the
aroma
medium
bodied
with
lowish

pretty

for

this
had
some

to
it

this

ones
i
have
had
the
peppery

saved
this
from
being

with
small
quickly
dissipating
head
average
carbonation
smells
super
sweet
with
plenty
of
bread
and
fruity
yeast
notes
first
sip
is
very
bready
and
biting
with
mild
tartness
extremely
tasty
great
and
welcomed
bitter
finish
nice
medium
bodied
umm
wow
the
smokiness
has
changed
to
cigarette
butts
not
even
kidding
while
the
nose
has
gotten
funkier
and
sweeter
smelling
almost
candy
like
the
flavor
has
shall
we
say
developed
it
still
has
the
fruity
front
but
the
smoky
flavor
that
was
once
there
has
become
more
prominent
and
the
aftertaste
is
straight
ashtray
not
as
bitter
as
before
but
not
better
still
very
interesting
and
complex
flavors
but
good
god
this
beer
is
curiously
lackluster
not
bad
in
any
particular
way
but
it
really
doesnt
have
any
spark
or
zing
to
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
smells
very
earthy
and
with
a
fairly
big
hit
of
dry
malt
tastes
earthy
as
well
but
fairly
plain
nice
bitter
finish
but
no
hoppy
zing
or
belgian
yeast
fruit
and
spice
or
candi
sugar
sweetness
just
sort
of
dry
and
bready
with
some
earthy
hops
and
fairly
flat
in
flavor
some
spicy
hops
at
the
end
that
carry
through
in
the
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
not
bad
but
not
memorable
the
description
of
this
beer
on
ba
is
belgian
pale
ale
is
that
right
doesnt
taste
like
it
to
me
bottle
from
julios
brought
back
by
jason
cloudy
orange
with
lots
of
white
head
lots
of
lace
after
wierd
aroma
but
great
control
spiciness
with
a
malted
offset
musty
a
funky
experience
from
the
wild
yeast
but
very
good
for
what
it
is
this
aroma
may
fall
away
with
some
ageing
shared
with
a
couple
of
friends
over
the
weekend
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
full
champagnelike
head
into
a
snifter
good
retention
smells
of
sweet
carmel
type
candy
with
a
good
amount
of
mustiness
to
boot
with
some
warming
you
cna
get
more
funk
on
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
at
first
finishes
extremel
dry
with
no
aftertaste
i
get
some
pheno
bandaid
flavor
in
the
finish
that
intensifies
as
the
beer
warms
good
active
fizzy
mouhtfeel
solid
wild
ale
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
a
beer
inspired
by
orval
as
a
homage
of
sorts
but
certainly
quite
unique
in
its
own
right
with
a
complex
zany
array
of
flavors
fairly
decent
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
spectacular
the
nose
is
really
complex
and
interesting
but
that
doesnt
translate
flavorwise
as
this
tastes
much
more
straightforward
for
the
price
i
would
hope
for
more
taste
mouthfeel
herbal
peppery
slightly
tart
up
front
the
malt
base
is
very
dry
but
theres
more
bitterness
than
id
like
and
not
enough
bretty
funk
or
sourness
like
a
rough
unrefined
orval
with
excessive
bitterness
the
finish
is
loaded
with
bitter
herbal
hops
and
dry
husky
grain
after
half
a
glass
all
i
could
taste
was
bitterness
not
terribly
impressive
most
of
the
bottle
went
down
the
drain
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
this
almost
has
a
jekyll
and
hyde
flavor
personality
thankfully
the
aroma
is
all
nice
funky
goodness
up
front
it
is
quite
fruity
smooth
and
tasty
but
towards
the
finish
it
starts
to
get
wild
harsh
and
phenolic
in
the
end
i
would
balance
this
a
bit
more
towards
the
pleasant
notes
even
in
the
finish
there
are
solid
good
tasting
flavor
contributions
all
of
which
ultimately
save
this
from
being
unenjoyable
d
better
than
expected
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
consumed
at
warmer
than
cellar
temps
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
subtle
details
of
this
beer
the
warmer
it
got
drinkablity
is
not
to
stellar
at
this
point
just
not
too
exciting
or
tasty
a
bit
thick
very
bitter
and
lacking
depth
for
the
price
youd
be
better
served
to
sit
on
these
for
a
while
the
cork
had
a
nice
pop
but
the
beer
barely
moved
id
hope
with
some
time
under
its
belt
it
would
overflow
a
bit
darker
orange
color
with
a
long
lasting
foam
but
it
doesnt
have
the
mountainlike
froth
of
orval
aroma
is
pleasant
similar
to
orval
but
doesnt
quite
have
the
full
aromatics
of
the
original
flavor
is
spot
on
in
terms
of
the
trappist
pale
style
this
is
a
beer
style
hardly
ever
replicated
because
its
hard
but
they
nailed
it
imo
flavor
is
a
lot
like
orval
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
little
touch
of
brett
im
not
crazy
about
the
beer
but
its
a
good
recipe
and
well
brewed
im
a
bit
confused
by
this
one
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
overall
nice
beer
not
epic
but
tasty
sweetness
is
very
refreshing
definitely
a
mood
beer
this
has
a
pleasing
pinkish
hued
color
with
a
lightly
floral
aroma
of
flor
de
jamaica
and
a
touch
of
citrus
round
it
out
the
jamaica
hibiscus
lends
a
pleasing
floral
note
to
the
flavor
something
akin
to
a
clean
belgoyeasty
character
i
liked
it
bottle
poured
a
pinkish
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
notes
with
light
fruity
ester
with
some
hibiscus
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
hibiscus
notes
with
some
sweet
malt
notes
and
light
fruity
ester
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
i
was
expecting
hibiscus
to
be
even
more
showcase
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
very
tropicalfruity
almost
like
a
beer
fruit
punch
thus
far
i
have
not
been
impressed
by
stones
stochasticity
projects
i
dont
know
what
a
hibiscus
tastes
like
but
this
does
taste
as
the
label
leads
slight
tart
flowerly
taste
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
would
not
be
the
first
beer
i
reached
for
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
likely
to
purchase
again
something
offputting
in
the
taste
i
thought
i
had
already
reviewed
this
are
there
2
hibiscus
beers
in
this
project
this
is
a
really
tricky
beer
the
one
im
drinking
was
bottled
on
090514
im
not
sure
if
some
flavor
went
away
with
being
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
but
i
still
like
it
i
feel
the
flavors
would
really
come
out
if
i
had
this
with
a
meal
i
would
drink
this
again
its
smooth
and
light
the
aromas
are
not
powerful
but
do
the
job
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend
if
they
would
want
to
try
something
different
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
pale
amber
producing
3
fingers
of
frothy
offwhite
somewhat
lasting
head
which
fades
into
a
thin
cap
leaving
a
thin
wash
of
splotchy
lace
aroma
is
slightly
sour
belgian
yeast
fruit
notes
of
apple
with
hints
of
raspberry
cranberry
cherry
wheat
biscuit
cracker
malts
hints

im
not
sure
what
hibiscus
smells
like
but
it

be
in
there

slightly
creamy
a

with

in
the

i
love
stone
and
i
love
all
their
beers
but
this
one
wasnt
for
me
i
couldnt
get
into
it
at
all
i
had
glass
and
drain
poured
the
rest
definite
belgian
characteristic
with
phenolic
undertones
mild
fruity
hibiscus
flavor
became
more
apparent
as
temperature
increased
closer
to

slightly
cloudy
with

redpink
hue
improved
flavor
as
approached
room
temperature
clean
finish
keep
upright
layer
of
yeast
on
bottom
personally
not
my
favorite
beer
by
stone
but
very
clean
and
well
done
for
what
they
were
going
for
maybe
the
worst
stone
ive
ever
had
but
a
lot
better
than
so
many
other
breweries
nice
enough
but
not
my
jam
kind
of
a
weird
floral
fruity
taste
up
front
with
a
low
wave
of
hop
bitterness
to
follow
i
want
to
like
it
more
than
i
do
right
up
my
alley
beautiful
cooper
color
orange
and
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
smoke
easy
on
the
hops
just
a
tad
too
sweet
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
eric
overall
i
thought
this
was
nice
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
since
i
didnt
pick
up
much
belgian
yeast
and
to
me
it
tastes
me
like
a
pale
ale
base
as
an
herbspiced
beer
i
would
say
its
a
little
above
average
for
the
style
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
slightly
refreshing
crisp
a
little
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
just
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
i
might
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
good
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
just
got
to
be
a
little
bland
and
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
too
memorable
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
nice
to
try
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
glass
of
it
but
its
not
something
i
feel
the
need
to
buy
more
of
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hibiscus
in
their
beer
i
thought
that
aspect
was
showcased
better
than
just
about
every
other
hibiscus
beer
ive
had
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
it
had
some
good
aspects
to
it
but
it
also
had
some
that
needed
a
little
work
and
in
the
end
i
just
wanted
a
little
more
out
of
this
beer
it
isnt
a
favorite
stone
beer
or
a
favorite
from
this
series
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
hibiscus
beers
ive
had
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
beer
keep
up
the
solid
work
o
luckily
i
was
able
to
compare
the
flavorssmells
to
some
dried
hibiscus
flowers
i
had
interesting
and
different
i
would
never
have
expected
hibiscus
in
a
bspa
just
not
my
style
this
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
for
christmas
not
sure
i
would
like
it
but
it
was
free
so
what
the
hey
it
taste
to
me
like
a
wine
cooler
ive
tried
several
fruit
beers
and
i
have
yet
to
like
one
of
them
i
guess
if
your
into
this
style
it
would
be
fine
but
its
not
for
me
sometimes
hibiscus
beers
can
seem
a
bit
sweet
and
overly
flowery
to
me
so
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
to
try
this
one
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
the
hibiscus
mixed
nicely
with
some
nice
citrusy
aspects
of
this
beer
enjoyable
i
love
hibiscus
flowers
and
beer
not
as
much
after
taste
as
boulevard
gose
very
good
color
is
dark
pink
with
no
head
just
a
thin
film
in
the
glass
aroma
is
very
flowery
with
some
grapefruit
notes
flavor
is
kinda
funky
belgian
yeasty
flavors
with
some
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
lacking
any
bite
as
well
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
version
of
the
stochiasticity
project
beer
compared
to
the
previous
releases
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
hazy
rose
tinted
copper
coloring
with
a
fluffy
clingy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
low
profile
coating
aromas
of
heavy
floral
notes
tangy
sweet
old
world
fruit
bubble
gum
cotton
candy
toasted
grains
subtle
citrus
highlights
and
hints
of
bitter
hops
characteristics
interesting
flavors
are
mild
with
berry
sweetness
and
fairly
heavy
floral
notes
forward
there
is
a
tangy
sweet
fruit
note
with
the
aforementioned
berry
highlighted
by
orange
and
a
building
bitterness
in
the
undertones
of
the
palate
fairly
muted
feel
remaining
light
overall
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
citrus
acidity
as
well
as
floral
and
hops
bitterness
the
finish
is
fairly
shortlived
with
only
the
slightest
fruit
and
floral
linger
definitely
a
unique
brew
overall
a
pretty
unique
and
interesting
twist
on
a
belgian
ale
nice
presence
of
fruit
and
spice
odd
but
good
o
3
25
stone
has
hits
and
misses
with
its
experiments
this
is
a
big
fat
miss
while
a
bit
deviant
from
the
stylistic
norm
this
was
strong
enough
to
still
fall
under
the
category
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
remain
true
to
form
a
bit
more
yeast
and
some
lemon
pepper
would
have
really
taken
this
to
another
level
but
as
it
was
i
enjoyed
it
and
how
nicely
it
went
down
the
floral
notes
dominated
a
bit
too
much
here
but
anyone
who
loves
smooth
belgiianstyle
beers
or
stones
other
offerings
will
not
be
disappointed
here
this
is
worth
a
shot
for
those
looking
for
something
a
bit
off
of
the
beaten
path
o
definitely
something
different
not
really
that
surprising
from
the
project
standpoint
that
drinks
pretty
much
as
billed
good
beer
for
summer
with
all
the
floral
and
fruity
notes
going
on
would
be
interesting
to
age
some
pick
some
up
if
you
like
all
things
stone
or
fruity
wheatbelgian
beers
drinks
easy
enough
but
doesnt
seem
that
belgian
yeast
profile
is
damped
down
not
one
i
would
buy
again
but
worth
a
go
if
you
stretching
your
beer
tasting
wings
o
not
bad
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
orange
peel
i
think
the
hibiscus
would
have
been
better
on
its
own
ive
loved
beer
for
years
and
i
am
starting
to
branch
out
onto
being
a
aficionado
i
stoll
have
yet
to
learn
the
terminology
but
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
at
a
place
called
the
station
taproom
in
downingtown
pa
i
fell
in
love
i
think
this
is
definitely
my
new
favorite
blue
moon
is
definitely
taking
a
backseat
to
this
one
now
if
i
could
just
find
out
where
to
get
it
tastes
like
hand
soap
smells
do
not
burp
if
youre
unfortunate
enough
to
be
drinking
this
first
time
ive
been
disappointed
by

had
hibiscus
beers
are
patently
underwhelming
as
the
delicateness
of
the
flowers
cant
stand
up
to
the
process
not
here
oh
not
here
florals
and
fruit
abound
good
stuff
for
a
mere
purported
project
overall
perhaps
my
second
favorite
quadrotriticale
being
1
stochasticity
offering
hibiscusicity
is
the
glamorous
avantgarde
and
maybe
black
sheep
cousin
to
verboten
or
maredsous

keep
up
the
strange
work
stone
overall
impressive
more
drinkable
than
i
was
anticipating
i
mark
it
down
as
a
win
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
when
you
buy
a
stone
beer
you
expect
a
high
quality
i
find
it
funny
that
the
last
one
of
their
beers
i
tried
was
the
awesome
xocoveza
this
one
is
a
total
misfire
o
highly
drinkable
belgian
ale
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
lighter
belgian
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
do
not
love
the
yeast
profiles
but
this
one
is
quite
palatable
even
though
it
may
not
be
true
to
style
nice
beer
pours
a
pinkish
orange
hue
with
a
12
head
big
floral
and
ctrius
aroma
the
taste
follows
the
nose
as
the
hibiscus
and
orange
really
come
through
with
some
moderate
wheat
profile
refrshing
and
it
has
a
short
lasting
aftertaste
well
balanced
beer
o
interesting
beer
refreshing
and
the
tart
bite
makes
you
want
to
keep
sipping
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
presence
o
a
pretty
good
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
worth
trying
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
it
pours
a
beautiful
pinkish
red
with
a
one
finger
lacey
head
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
fruity
like
a
typical
belgium
style
the
orange
smell
is
present
and
there
is
a
subtle
perfume
fragrance
that
might
be
the
hibiscus
the
flavor
is
almost
candy
like
its
very
sweet
and
the
hibiscus
is
quite
present
i
would
prefer
a
much
thicker
mouth
feel
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
redorange
amber
with
a
half
finger
aged
ivory
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
strawberries
stone
fruit
with
an
overripe
fruit
or
tropical
flower
component
flavor
is
orange
citrus
and
overripe
tropical
fruit
berries
slightly
buttery
wheat
finishes
with
floral
fruit
and
a
slight
clove
astringency
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
an
appropriately
floral
influenced
belgian
with
interesting
but
odd
fruit
flavors
slightly
unbalanced
the
malt
body
does
not
seem
to
support
the
floral
and
fruit
flavors
throughout
the
taste
kept
me
interested
but
once
was
enough
nice
tart
and
citrus
notes
but
the
flavor
dies
at
the
end
taste
great
carbonation
lemon
cake
with
some
faint
bitterness
a
very
smooth
a
slightly
syrupy
finish
strawberry
and
apple
juice
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
calls
itself
a
honey
ale
nice
taste
of
citrus
and
spice
too
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
tight
medium
head
kind
of
expensive
for
me
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
like
it
about
as
well
as
anything
available
right
now
not
really
doing
it
for
me
or
drawing
me
back
to
it
i
had
this
since
first
writing
this
review
though
and
think
really
a
worth
while
beer
to
try
would
be
good
as
an
appertif
by
itself
or
with
tomato
based
pastas
cool
labeling
with
a
long
haired
warrior
being
from
canada
the
very
idea
of
honey
ale
does
not
inspire
a
whole
lot
of
hope
on
my
beer
radar
when
i
am
presented
with
an
example
of
such
leave
it
to
some
oldworld
brewing
goodness
to
break
me
out
of
that
bit
of
reverie
this
one
performs
said
charitable
act
with
aplomb
honey
yes
up
the
wazoo
but
moderated
by
grain
yeast
hop
and
yes
alcohol
alike
to
provide
us
with
a
crazily
workable
and
drinkable
end
result
i
strongly
recommend
barbar
o
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
if
the
price
was
right
but
not
really
something
i
would
hunt
down
surprising
to
have
this
on
tap
at
mission
pizza
great
mellow
family
blue
grass
pizza
pub
in
fremont
ca
and
i
ordered
a
pint
after
a
taste
the
bartender
not
knowing
where
it
came
from
so
i
figured
it
must
be
a
new
brewery
in
ca
wrong
and
feeling
ignorant
i
just
really
like
the
subtle
honey
undertone
of
this
surprisingly
strong
for
the
mellowness
of
it
very
golden
and
lovely
as
i
sit
at
table
on
sidewalk
as
the
sundry
to
the
west
aaaaah
california
but
this
is
belgium
in
a
suburban
east
bay
buzz
and
it
feels
and
tastes
so
right
the
taste
is
a
nice
honey
flavor
with
the
fruity
yeast
character
giving
the
beer
a
belgian
taste
with
fruit
light
solvent
and
some
clove
peach
and
lychees
the
malt
taste
is
a
little
thin
but
for
a
blonde
beer
this
is
ok
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
jellylike
clumps
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
glass
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
fruit
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
grapelike
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

it

the

intense

on

they

o
really
my

not

heavy
an

can
i
have
another

overall
nice
belgian

honey
was
not
overpowering
never
in
a
million
years
could
one
guess
this
was
8
abv
by
smelling
or
tasting
it
it
pours
a
very
light
sandy
yellow
color
with
a
tall
belgian
style
white
head
and
a
mild
haze
smells
like
fresh
floral
clover
honey
and
belgian
yeast
this
is
a
very
bright
beer
light
in
flavor
but
complex
honey
flavor
but
not
sweetness
pollen
wheat
malt
and
a
gentle
peppery
quality
are
all
present
here
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
prime
light
and
crisp
infinitely
drinkable
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
miraculously
satisfying
finish
this
is
a
great
bottle
of
beer
and
one
i
very
much
look
forward
to
trying
again
the
honey
is
as
well
balanced
yet
prominent
in
this
beer
as
in
any
beer
ive
tasted
bravo
review
from

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
with
a
moderate
off
white
head
with

nice
looking
belgian
spice
aroma
nice
medium
body
with
pale
malts
fruit
belgian
spices
and
distinct
honey
honey
and
slight
hop
finish
a
bit
sweet
and
has
a
brief
acerbic
flavor
but
overall
quite
nice
and
interesting
ale
similar
to
a
triple
but
heavier
bodied
and
with
a
nice
honey
backbone
i
will
try
this
again
overall
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
look
and
decent
feel
but
it
is
simply
way
too
sweet
for
me
that
said
the
flavors
are
otherwise
decent
o
ive
used
similar
words
a
few
times
in
this
review
but
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
strange
the
honey
character
is
big
and
adds
some
notes
you
dont
find
in
most
beers
dont
know
if
i
would
by
again
for
myself
but
interesting
nonetheless
maybe
a
bit
too
much
honey
orange
flipflops
with
the
coriander
on
the
flavor
and
makes
a
bigger
impression
quite
sweet
and
the
coriander
accentuates
that
a
bit
without
much
to
offset
the
sweet
flavors
maybe
a
kiss
of
drying
alcohol
not
bad
especially
if
you
think
of
it
more
as
an
imperial
wit
than
bspa
i
think
it
has
more
in
common
with
the
former
pretty
good
brew
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
so
its
good
quaffable
presentation
packaged
in
an
11
2
ounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
the
taste
is
something
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
get
enough
of
it
is
a
good
thing
this
is
pretty
expensive
or
i
would
drink
it
all
day
instead
of
going
to
work
i
hope
the
perfect
aftertaste
lasts
until
tomorrow
o
delicious
beer
best
honey
beer
ive
ever
had
nice
beer
but
i
cant
decide
whether
it
is
summery
or
wintery
not
too
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
very
nice
and
overall
a
nicely
balanced
strong
pale
ale
the
honey
perhaps
didnt
add
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
quite
enjoyable
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
zesty
spice
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
dry
finish
huge
peppery
coriander
flavor
along
with
some
citrus
rind
this
is
complimented
by
a
spicy
hop
bite
that
has
hints
of
dry
grassy
pine
the
honey
flavor
is
there
but
subtle
and
not
artificially
sweet
theres
also
sweet
light
fruit
notes
especially
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
banana
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
at
first
but
its
fairly
light
and
easy
to
drink
o
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
dont
see
what
the
fuzz
is
all
about
a
decent
a
bit
above
average
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
honey
makes
it
interesting
but
in
this
style
the
grade
is
cant
be
higher
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
lookin
golden
color
it
has
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
on
top
and
leaves
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
its
got
some
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
has
just
a
little
bit
of
honey
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
on
the
sweeter
side
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
braggot
ale
or
anything
it
is
more
or
less
just
a
sweet
golden
ale
the
mouthfeel
had
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
still
has
a
smooth
body
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
o
overall
this
beer
rocks
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
the
best
honey
beer
style
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
d
semi
sessionable
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
the
abv
is
probably
too
high
for
that
a
decent
beer
and
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
most
belgian
styles
thanks
to
jdiddy
for
passing
this
one
along
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
best
before
1013
indicated
on
the
back
label
pours
a
dull
honeycolored
hue
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
is
really
interesting
citrus
coriander
grass
and
honey
almost
reminds
me
of
an
herbal
cough
drop
ala
ricola
taste
comes
together
a
bit
better
than
i
would
anticipate
from
the
nose
the
same
elements
are
still
there
and
the
overall
impression
is
still
the
same
however
the
edges
are
a
bit
more
rounded
out
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
carbonation
that
is
lively
and
also
a
bit
gassy
theres
also
a
very
faint
citrus
astringency
in
the
mix
finish
is
crisp
with
some
residual
carbonation
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
not
a
beer
i
think
i
need
to
revisit
its
definitely
interesting
and
has
some
witbier
qualities
to
it
but
this
beer
just
falls
a
little
short
for
me
drink
this
was
pretty
tasty
and
the
honey
was
well
tempered
honey
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
but
this
was
okay
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
nice
balance
between
heavy
and
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
just
a
slight
warming
from
the
8
but
it
really
isnt
noticeable
at
all
i
could
sit
and
drink
a
pile
of
these
overall
this
is
more
belgan
blonde
almost
forgot
to
mention
there
is
just
enough
funk
here
than
either
bier
de
miel
or
saison
think
a
more
interesting
leffe
very
tasty
o
what
a
great
find
this
brew
is
everything
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
well
done
i
hope
to
find
more
beers
like
this
one
throughout
the
summer
dr
not
a
good
session
beer
but
maybe
worth
a
go
for
fans
of
the
style
hides
its
relatively
high
abv
pretty
well
very
affordable
in
belgium
d
a
tasty
brew
but
im
just
not
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
one
and
done
for
me
but
its
always
cool
to
drink
something
that
is
modeled
after
or
made
according
to
an
ancient
recipe
barbar
pours
a
clear
golden
color
bone
white
fizzy
head
forms
and
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
in
the
aroma
honey
malt
sweetness
and
some
floral
hops
also
a
note
of
coriander
like
spice
in
the
flavor
dry
spicyness
reminiscent
of
coriander
lemon
zest
and
anise
a
nice
sweetness
and
belgian
yeast
kick
pair
well
with
the
spices
solid
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
overall
a
tasty
little
beer
here
a
pleasent
mix
of
malt
belgian
yeast
honey
and
spice
barbãr
sounds
like
the
kind
of
beer
made
on
a
dare
but
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
its
one
of
the
few
8
beers
youll
end
up
chugging
rather
than
sipping
it
was
a
bold
man
he
who
first
decided
to
toil
with
such
dissonant
oddball
ingredients
and
it
was
a
very
adept
one
who
could
formulate
such
a
delicious
balanced
recipe
out
of
them
i
loudly
applaud
brasserie
lefèbvre
for
this
offering
id
buy
it
anytime
d
this
was
a
decent
bspa
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
so
i
will
merit
it
on
that
i
would
drink
another
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
pay
for
another
notes
overall
barbar
honey
ale
is
a
very
tasty
and
complex
ale
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
is
delicious
complex
fresh
delightful
bundle
or
various
flavors
amazing
how
those
brilliant
belgians
hide
the
alcohol
in
the
various
flavors
do
your
soul
a
favor
and
give
this
a
try
you
deserve
it
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
seek
it
out
again
the
alcohol
well
was
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
really
came
together
well
d
tastes
bit
strong
but
is
quenching
in
its
way
i
could
imagine
quaffing
a
bowl
after
battle
but
its
not
something
id
want
to
sip
after
dinner
not
recommended
not
the
best
beer
youll
ever
have
but
interesting
enough
to
highly
recommend
a
try
md
pretty
easy
drinking
for
being
relatively
high
in
alcohol
this
beers
manages
to
set
itself
apart
from
the
wonderful
world
of
belgian
beers
goes
very
well
with
strong
cheese
ages
ago
before
there
was
sugar
they
used
to
sweeten
the
beer
with
honey
therefore
this
should
give
a
great
idea
how
sweet
beer
tasted
back
then
d
really
high
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
abv
is
reasonable
for
the
style
and
i
got
through
mine
quick
considering
it
was
shared
jd
notes
at
first
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
one
but
it
grew
on
me
tasty
and
very
light
for
8
abv
very
nice
this
beer
was
bought
et
the
saq
in
the
kit
meter
of
beer
poured
from
a
330ml
brown
bottle
nice
dark
golden
very
clear
bottle
white
head
on
top
on
the
nose
we
can
smell
clover
flowers
maybe
clover
flower
honey
good
taste
with
a
lot
of
residual
sugar
some
honey
flavor
too
very
drinkable
tasted
fresh
and
alcohol
had
a
slight
warming
effect
dpretty
high
at
only
3
99
a
bottle
this
is
a
bargain
i
like
this
beer
but
only
one
at
a
time
i
am
sure
the
sweetness
that
it
hides
so
well
would
eventually
come
to
the
fore
and
ruin
the
flavours
for
me
bottle
at
chancey
smith
decent
drinking
belgian
pale
unexceptional
other
than
some
orange
in
flavour
honey
in
the
secondary
golden
yellow
coloured
body
with
some
head
lots
of
lace
high
carbonation
neutral
aromas
perhaps
the
honey
absorbs
it
easy
mouthfeel
the
smoothness
from
the
honey
overrides
the
carbonation
nice
summer
belgian
d
nicely
drinkable
alcohol
pretty
well
hidden
at
only
1
a
bottle
i
am
going
to
have
to
buy
more
of
this
sounded
good
but
i
am
not
a
fan
i
really
dont
like
the
taste
it
is
a
bit
too
chemicallike
d
this
was
a
pretty
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
like
a
honey
witbier
it
was
fairly
clean
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
its
worth
sipping
to
fully
appreciate
the
unique
honey
character
recommended
if
only
to
try
once
md
the
feel
is
light
sticky
and
carbonated
like
a
european
mineral
water
the
drinkability
is
good
minus
the
smell
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
pours
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
bread
and
a
quite
vivid
honey
note
reminiscent
of
homemade
biscuits
with
honey
on
them
sweet
grainy
flavor
solid
honey
influence
with
a
barelythere
grassiness
lightly
astringent
dry
and
a
bit
unclean
in
the
finish
still
very
drinkable
d
very
enjoyable
as
the
honey
is
there
but
not
cloying
like
honey
can
so
often
be
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
relaxing
on
a
winter
night
or
hanging
out
with
friends
in
the
summer
im
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
but
i
will
definitely
be
ordering
this
again
t
taste
of
strong
honey
syrupy
consistency
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
some
orange
spices
very
light
malt
flavor
almost
unnoticeable
with
the
strong
honey
presence
drinkability
for
me
was
unfortunately
low
as
the
honey
was
just
too
much
for
me
i
havent
drank
many
meads
excluding
hopslam
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
thicker
varieties
of
honey
belgian
strong
ales
and
to
think
it
is
only
8
notes
a
lot
like
a
mead
but
with
more
of
a
beer
particularly
a
hefe
base
had
it
one
winter
night
and
it
was
great
to
sip
on
and
have
a
warming
feeling
a
very
nice
easy
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
beer
good
stuff
the
scent
of
flowers
mixed
with
honey
and
orange
is
sweet
and
even
if
the
beer
is
fermented
honey
it
reminds
one
chouia
it
does
indeed
power
than
hanging
around
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
points
at
this
time
honey
roasted
the
body
is
sparkling
in
his
mouth
while
drinking
sweet
taste
is
quite
pronounced
and
postflavored
honey
has
cut
the
bitterness
of
the
drink
and
makes
it
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
without
making
it
sweet
definitely
notice
the
honey
in
this
brew
pretty
prominent
in
the
taste
but
not
in
a
bad
way
at
all
it
is
a
brew
that
falls
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
thought
with
the
honey
additiontheme
peppery
alcohol
some
herbal
spiciness
light
hint
of
fruitiness
pretty
nice
actually
lighter
to
medium
body
overall
and
with
very
bubbly
tight
carbonation
interesting
enough
but
not
as
quaffable
neat
brew
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
really
well
constructed
brew
flavours
play
off
eachother
treally
well
giving
it
a
surprising
drinkability
given
the
big
alcohol
content
overall
an
above
average
belgian
strong
ale
on
the
other
hand
with
the
honey
sweetness
its
not
a
beer
youd
want
more
than
2
bottles
of
on
an
evening
d
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
hopefully
the
sweet
flavor
doesnt
change
my
mind
it
is
very
palatable
and
would
be
sessionable
if
it
were
lower
in
abv
pours
a
golden
clear
orangish
colored
body
with
a
big
frothy
creamy
white
head
lastingish
spicy
aroma
some
orange
peel
lemon
and
citrus
floral
taste
sweet
and
almost
sickly
strong
honey
taste
some
citrus
and
orange
and
lemon
too
mostly
light
tasting
sweet
aftertaste
very
floral
d
very
complex
beer
and
one
that
would
be
a
crowd
pleaser
as
well
good
enough
to
have
several
in
one
sitting
if
you
can
put
up
with
the
carbonation
good
beer
and
its
something
that
you
should
pick
up
if
the
opportunity
comes
about
dok
pretty
easy
going
but
not
amazing
this
seems
similar
to
some
of
the
imperial
witbiers
that
are
popping
up
here
and
there
in
the
usa
i
think
this
one
is
interesting
to
sample
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
liked
the
taste
that
the
honey
added
worth
trying
sometime
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
different
but
great
spicy
sweet
and
creamy
this
beer
has
it
all
highly
recommendable
drinks
alright
had
this
on
tap
in
germany
at
a
beer
fest
it
was
better
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
may
have
suffered
just
a
bit
during
travel
if
i
ever
drink
it
again
i
will
let
it
warm
way
up
i
tried
this
beer
on
december
22
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
pale
gold
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
lasted
the
aroma
was
grainy
malt
and
a
little
honey
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
was
more
grainy
malt
some
milky
tones
and
a
little
honey
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
barbar
pours
a
finger
of
foam
over
a
slightly
cloudy
honey
colored
brew
carbonation
is
steady
the
nose
is
funky
belgian
yeast
all
the
way
fruity
and
cidery
the
flavor
is
sweet
light
malt
up
front
with
notes
of
butterscotch
honey
and
orange
theres
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
off
the
back
and
a
little
bite
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
starts
round
goes
crisp
and
dries
a
bit
the
honey
mentioned
on
the
label
contributing
a
little
to
both
i
imagine
very
smooth
and
drinkable
maybe
a
little
too
drinkable
for
8
alcohol
by
volume
very
cool
label
worth
checking
out
very
tasty
treat
im
struggling
not
to
take
a
sip
every
30
seconds
found
down
at
busters
in
memphis
try
one
if
you
can
find
one
really
soft
and
full
great
soft
carbonation
love
the
feel
very
easy
drinker
a
great
beer
for
this
style
as
the
beer
warms
the
malt
really
comes
through
d
not
that
great
there
are
more
interesting
inspiring
bspa
out
there
this
is
actually
a
bit
forgettable
despite
that
unique
white
grape
shot
of
sweetness
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
spectrum
overall
not
bad
very
honey
sweet
with
a
slight
boozy
touch
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
d
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
ever
so
slightly
noticeable
this
would
make
a
wonderful
summer
beer
a
sweet
and
balanced
belgian
pale
ale
33
cl
bottle
this
brew
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
light
honey
grain
and
pale
malts
its
strange
but
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
hot
summer
day
theres
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
in
the
background
of
aroma
the
taste
though
carries
almost
no
bitterness
it
has
honey
and
malt
flavors
but
restrained
bitterness
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
not
at
all
cloying
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
and
some
bitterness
round
out
the
beer
its
quite
good
much
better
than
expected
drinkable
and
flavorful
overall
not
a
bad
beer
im
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
honey
in
a
beer
but
it
is
a
decent
brew
date

d
definitely
unusual
far
too
cloying
for
my
taste
this
one
is
a
chore
to
drink
overall
i
couldnt
help
but
be
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
perhaps
i
should
have
expected
something
so
sweet
but
it
just
didnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
other
belgians
i
had
that
night
it
does
have
a
lot
going
for
it
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
it
next
time
drinkability
everytime
i
see
a
new
belgian
brew
with
a
low
price
tag
im
always
hesitant
in
this
case
it
was
a
nice
suprise
very
drinkable
and
tasty
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
on
the
palate
this
one
is
oilyand
slick
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
delicate
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
dry
finish
that
eggs
you
on
to
take
another
sip
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
can
see
this
one
being
dangerously
drinkable
in
the
hot
summer
months
look
out
this
is
one
that
you
might
easily
find
yourself
getting
unintentionally
drunk
off
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
drinks
that
well
just
like
a
wit
and
just
like
a
wit
it
is
equally
refreshing
this
is
one
that
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
again
as
far
as
beers
brewed
with
honey
midas
touch
and
this
are
the
best
ive
had
so
far
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
try
it
once
and
i
am
sure
you
wont
want
a
whole
case
of
the
stuff
taste
is
complex
tart
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
cloying
but
not
quite
and
a
bit
bitter
in
the
end
some
spice
big
fruits
and
clove
exist
and
the
honey
essence
is
mixed
in
fairly
well
which
finishes
things
off
nicely
mouthfeel
is
rounded
and
creamy
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
bit
of
crispness
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
with
the
8
alcohol
being
barely
noticeable
its
well
carbonated
which
keeps
things
pretty
airy
in
the
mouth
not
bad
overall
but
not
totally
my
cup
otea
either
its
extremely
drinkable
cold
warmth
reveals
a
bit
more
of
the
alcohol
and
spice
and
turns
it
to
more
of
a
sipping
beer
cold
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
if
i
take
it
slow
and
savor
its
character
as
it
warms
id
still
want
a
second
d
a
tad
sweet
but
has
a
well
hidden
abv
behind
the
sweetness
good
for
a
try
if
anything
always
game
to
try
the
new
stuff
to
the
neighborhood
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
beer
is
caught
somewhere
between
a
witbier
and
a
mead
the
pour
brings
out
more
of
a
mead
appearance
with
a
honeylike
color
golden
light
amber
with
a
heaviness
and
legging
like
brandy
aromas
are
also
meadlike
up
front
with
a
sharp
honey
nectar
scent
before
the
wheat
malts
barley
and
twangy
yeast
character
builds
in
estery
citrusy
and
flowery
throughout
the
nose
flavors
heavily
favor
the
sweet
honey
flavor
with
a
backup
of
wheat
malt
barely
yeasty
flavors
and
herbal
tea
notes
to
follow
the
hop
flavors
give
a
much
needed
complexity
balance
and
variety
spicy
with
witlike
corriander
curraco
pepper
and
a
lot
of
yeast
contributions
the
textures
as
expected
are
a
bit
syrupy
heavy
and
more
cloying
than
malty
a
hoppy
bittering
is
the
only
repreive
finishes
spicy
warm
and
sweet
a
good
substitute
for
a
mead
similar
to
the
ancient
brewed
concoctions
that
are
being
revived
by
some
dogfish
head
brews
interesting
but
not
exactly
sessionable
this
makes
a
nice
apertif
on
a
day
when
the
temperature
is
approaching
hellacious
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
follow
it
up
with
another
or
several
more
if
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
id
rate
this
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
an
essential
one
with
all
the
honey
it
ends
up
feeling
very
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
a
bit
cloying
pleasant
but
not
great
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
has
a
smoothness
and
a
refreshing
quality
that
makes
it
deceptively
drinkable
when
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
honeyish
ale
this
one
is
certainly
one
to
grab
an
interesting
and
drinkable
ale
sweet
spicy
perhaps
not
the
most
balanced
although
both
sweetness
bitterness
are
both
there
in
spades
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
nice
and
smooth
could
have
a
few
but
8
abv
is
a
little
high
to
sessioning
barbar
pours
with
a
clear
golden
hue
moderate
head
and
carbonation
the
real
thing
about
it
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
these
flavors
are
doing
the
sent
of
honey
wheat
and
pepper
there
is
this
battle
of
funkyness
between
the
golden
style
and
the
calming
sweetness
of
the
honey
funky
tartness
like
the
inside
of
the
skin
of
the
granny
smith
apple
mixed
with
a
skin
of
a
lemon
held
togehter
with
pepper
and
orange
marmalade
wierd
and
it
leaves
a
grassy
aftertaste
with
a
citric
zest
somthing
refreshing
yet
contemplative
this
beer
pretty
much
comes
as
advertised
it
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
slight
bit
of
haze
modest
carbonation
a
reasonable
head
with
retention
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
mild
sweet
malts
honey
candied
florals
maybe
some
hard
to
pin
down
spices
some
alcohol
notes
too
the
taste
is
a
bit
sourish
some
candied
fermentables
spices
such
as
coriander
definite
honey
notes
some
typical
belgian
yeastiness
a
bit
of
orange
rind
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
strong
with
this
beer
and
it
is
not
masked
over
all
that
well
this
could
have
been
a
much
better
beer
with
more
crispness
and
less
alcohol
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
a
bit
drying
and
too
alcoholy
pours
a
five
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves

good

bought
it

pit
it

flowery

fine

sweet

evident
without
being
cloying

beautifully
balanced
and

quite
drinkable
should
not
have
been
filtered
i
will
drink
my
own
barbarian
from
now
on
barbar
meaning
barbarian
is
anything
but
an
unmannered
brute
its
a
civilized
tipple
that
combines
a
handful
of
classic
flavors
into
an
enjoyable
drinkable
whole
in
spite
of
the
3
49
price
tag
i
could
be
convinced
to
buy
it
again
actually
it
wouldnt
take
any
convincing
at
all
overall
not
a
bad
brew
after
youve
already
had
a
couple
its
ambitious
but
it
never
really
steps
up
to
the
plate
for
a
full
swing
the
ingredients
fall
together
but
never
mesh
so
much
as
coexist
tentatively
its
moderately
drinkable
on
a
good
day
i
guess
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
i
can
safely
say
that
despite
being
more
than
mediocre
this
wont
be
making
a
return
trip
to
my
fridge
overall
a
decent
enough
and
slightly
different
pale
ale
just
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
though
worth

the

came
flying
up
during
the

smells
of
apples
bubble

the
flavor
is
also

of

in

comes

pretty

i

with
an

that

is

spices
and
there
is
a
definite
hint
of
orange
there
as
well
feel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
it
and
a
decent

this

although
in

wont

this
is
a

product
and
i
applaud
the
craft
that
went
into

i
just
dont
care
for
the

profile
too
medicinal
for
my
tastebuds
simple
and
not
totally
balanced
but
enjoyable
refreshing
and
warming
at
the
same
time
not
bad
and
definitely
different
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
dt
glass
had
a
best
by
date
of
jan
09
it
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
slight
alcohol
shimmer
it
had
a
big
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
collar
good
carb
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
awesome
spicy
from
the
coriander
balanced
perfectly
with
the
orange
peel
and
honey
the
taste
was
also
incredible
starts
off
sweet
from
the
honey
then
the
spices
kick
in
to
be
followed
up
with
a
smooth
sweet
again
finish
i
find
most
beers
with
honey
to
be
overpoweringly
sweet
and
therefore
pretty
bad
but
this
one
gets
it
right
the
honey
should
be
a
nice
accent
like
here
and
not
the
dominant
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
but
had
just
a
tad
too
much
carb
it
distracted
you
from
the
great
flavor
overall
a
really
great
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
glad
to
see
this
one
hit
the
texas
market
and
look
forward
to
many
more
4
5
rr
t
y
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
laking
certain
characteristics
that
would
make
it
an
above
average
beer
the
flavor
is
mostly
light
and
a
bit
weak
as
a
result
the
8
abv
becomes
painfully
evident
as
the
brew
warms
okay
at
best
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
honey
and
coriander
and
malted
wheat
the
taste
is
can
be
a
little
too
alcoholic
with
wheat
and
honey
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
brew
but
the
drinkability
is
affected
because
the
alcohol
comes
out
a
little
too
much
poured
a
nice
deep
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
it
has
nice
aromas
of
orange
and
coriander
suttle
hops
and
slightly
alcoholic
it
the
taste
citrus
and
coriander
a
bitterness
with
a
dry
alcoholic
end
a
nice
little
burn
too
decent
body
malty
and
smooth
it
seems
to
go
down
too
easy
a
very
nice
beer
expecting
something
completly
different
but
enjoyed
it
now
just
put
some
yeast
in
the
damn
bottle
this
is
a
sipper
and
definitely
not
something
id
visit
again
on
a
regular
basis
good
but
not
that
good
i
can
definitely
taste
the
honey
but
it
isnt
overpowering
sweet
aftertaste
is
a
kind
of
citrus
no
strong
bite
or
aftertaste
that
usually
comes
along
with
stronger
beers
either
id
say
that
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
but
at
8
i
probably
wouldnt
get
very
far
perfect
beer
for
someone
like
me
who
is
trying
to
make
the
jump
from
mainstream
to
more
interesting
styles
d
pretty
good
an
interesting
beer
as
long
as
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
on
the
sweet
side
the
8
goes
down
without
much
fuss
very
easy
drinking
similar
in
that
respect
to
duvel
deceptive
abv
and
its
not
easy
to
sip
more
of
a
quaffer
would
be
a
nice
sessioner
in
a
750ml
serving
not
as
interesting
as
i
expected
pretty
average
overall
i
managed
to
drink
it
with
a
little
effort
fluffy
pale
yellow
almost
white
head
three
fingers
thick
make
it
beautiful
in
the
glass
nice
pale
golden
straw
coloring

nice
streamers
of
carbonation
pilsner
style
smell
with
notes
of
hops
citrus
spice
slightly
burns
the
nostrals
thick
in
the
mouth
but
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
taste
is
complex
and
interesting
honey
sweetness
mixed
with
spice
overtones
and
slight
bitterness
just
start
the
palate
small
tint
of
orange
lime
and
mellow
yeast
yum
not
what
the
smell
tells
you
its
going
to
taste
like
too
bad
this
is
priced
so
high
12
for
a
4pack
or
id
be
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
make
a
very
nice
aperitif
recommended
ill
get
it
again
if
i
see
it
but
not
for
the
1300
yen
roughly
13
i
paid
here
in
tokyo
very
good
beer
its
easy
to
fall
in
love
with
it
and
its
even
easier
to
get
drunk
with
it
beware
d
really
good
beer
i
was
expecting
much
more
of
the
honey
which
is
in
there
but
intermingled
nicely
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
overall
a
very
nice
brew
the
honey
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
beer
and
ill
definitely
drink
this
again
it
goes
down
just
so
well
well
worth
trying
pours
a
good
looking
light
hazy
gold
under
a
thick
1
5
finger
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
lots
of
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
with
the
orange
definitely
coming
on
strong
the
mouth
is
very
heavily
carbonated
but
fairly
light
not
nearly
as
sticky
as
i
expected
the
taste
is
sweet
honey
and
orange
definitely
come
out
strong
theres
some
malt
here
but
no
discernible
hops
the
finish
is
sweet
while
the
aftertaste
conjures
up
a
bit
of
orange
tanginess
to
go
with
the
sweet
honey
undoubtedly
a
good
beer
this
is
not
what
im
looking
for
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
with
an
impressive
and
persistant
head
aroma
of
honey
and
musty
yeast
with
notes
of
coriander
flavor
begins
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
malt
and
coriander
has
a
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
which
adds
a
nice
balace
moutfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
often
overall
impression
seems
to
be
another
duvel
knockoff
herbal
hoppy
flavour
in
the
finish
color
is
amberbronze
and
a
bit
cloudy
huge
white
head
with
an
amber
accent
smells
like
a
sour
beer
only
a
bit
sweeter
a
combination
of
different
tastes
such
as
caramel
candied
fruit
and
spices
gives
for
an
incredible
beer
delicious
a
really
tasty
strong
belgian
ale
even
tho
i
missed
the
targeted
season
by
a
month
or
so
warms
you
up
right
away
very
easy
feel
with
a
bit
thinner
feel
than
the
reserva
but
perhaps
a
more
drinkable
beer
malt
aroma
with
lots
of
fruit
with
a
slightly
boozey
dark
fruit
flavor
mostly
grape
husk
fig
and
apple
somewhat
slick
mouthfeel
finishes
pretty
easy
very
low
spicing
caramel
notes
and
biscuity
malts
make
this
like
a
caramel
cookie
hot
as
it
warms
o
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommend
a
little
too
sweet
but
ok
from
a
microbrewery
oakaged
it
has
a
funny
label
of
a
drunk
looking
guy
wearing
a
santa
hat
with
stars
i
wonder
what
it
means
it
pours
into
a
chalice
with
a
nice
creamy
head
it
looks
dark
brown
blurry
it
smells
like
plums
licorice
brown
sugar
some
liquid
bread
dark
cherries
medium
body
medium
to
low
carbonation
fruity
in
the
middle
and
an
explosion
of
flavors
that
hides
the
alcohol
this
is
pretty
amazing
overall
what
a
lovely
beer
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
on
balance
but
there
are
too
many
good
elements
here
to
outweigh
that
factor
i
think
this
is
a
great
stab
at
a
christmas
beer
big
abv
and
plenty
of
character
but
not
a
big
spice
bomb
dig
it
flavor
is
nearly
as
complex
with
a
slight
sweetness
of
fruit
and
candy
definite
notes
of
orange
peel
and
cinnamon
and
allspice
finishes
warm
and
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lively
but
not
too
spritzy
very
good
beer
and
recommended
sweet
malty
flavours
again
with
a
big
confectionery
character
some
noble
hops
remain
along
with
a
hit
of
booze
a
little
cloying
foams
a
bit
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
ruddy
leather
brown
body
tight
foam
thats
decent
smell
is
belgian
candi
taste
has
much
the
same
but
has
cinnamon
more
prominent
carbonation
is
lively
good
stuff
overall
o
excellent
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
as
im
guessing
this
one
might
have
peaked
already
im
looking
forward
to
the
newer
bb
aged
version
i
have
waiting
on
deck
however
i
am
drinking
legendary
stuff
here
o
delicious
nose
is
deceptive
taste
is
remarkable
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
love
what
destruisse
has
to
offer
overall
and
this
is
a
great
treat
reminds
me
so
much
of
their
neighbor
in
westvleteren
just
a
few
k
away
grab
if
you
have
the
opportunity
des
is

small
we
are
lucky
to

any
in

those
in

anyone
miss
my
time
there

its
a
fine
simple
example
but
its
also
kind
of
pedestrian
not
my
ideal
belgian
big
pale
ale
tripel
or
not
and
it
seems
like
de
struise
could
have
done
better
pretty
good
a
solid
brew
with
excellent
balance
perhaps
a
tad
too
dry
the
spices
and
herbs
seem
to
have
faded
to
the
point
where
they
cannot
be
individually
discerned
but
the
overall
flavour
is
pleasant
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
contributes
only
slightly
to
the
aromaflavour
not
the
most
amazing
christmas
brew
in
the
world
but
a
decent
wellcrafted
beer
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
getting
old
and
a
bit
oxidized
but
still
enjoyable
not
as
good
as
their
pannepot
but
a
nice
treat
at
a
real
good
price
of
5
99
per
bottle
drink
this
while
taking
apart
your
gingerbread
house
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
spicier
this
would
be
fresh
at
this
point
its
almost
like
an
herbal
tea
i
really
enjoyed
the
wine
like
character
it
had
and
the
way
the
abv
was
hidden
probably
one
of
the
better
spiced
holiday
beer
ive
had
but
when
considering
the
price
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
overall
this
beer
was
given
to
me
last
years
christmas
2011
and
served
christmas
night
a
year
later
and
without
a
doubt
a
beer
worth
aging
and
having
again
and
again
take
your

always

i

how
to
properly

this
ones
just

in
that

it
pours
a
clear

the
nose
comprises
mild

belgian

very

the

along
with

lavender
pine

and
plum
the
body
is
a

with

and
a

finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
bspa
though
nothing
all
that
earthshattering
or
anything
id
be
interested
in
trying
a
fresher
one
if
only
just
to
compare
the
experiences
the
body
is
medium
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
going
to
down
the
drain
complete
fail
despite
being
an
ugly
duckling
of
a
beer
the
taste
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
it
not
only
forms
proper
impressions
in
taste
but
excells
in
the
supple
sweetness
that
makes
belgianstyle
beers
magical
i
just
with
it
pushed
further
and
challenged
me
to
award
it
with
even
higher
scores
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
it
is
like
a
hyperactive
sweet
tripel
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
for
what
it
is
i
guess
it
is
fine
but
for
as
expensive
as
this
bottle
gets
this
is
not
a
good
beer
there
are
way
better
strong
pales
out
there
for
half
the
cost
and
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
beer
anytime
soon
the
beer
is
hazy
and
appears
dark
copper
colored
small
head
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
offers
malt
sweet
breads
yeast
caramels
rain
the
flavor
offers
caramel
and
butterscotch
candies
with
additional
notes
of
belgian
yeast
and
bready
malt
the
beer
is
relatively
light
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
solid
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
tsjeeses
reserva
a
reasonable
beer
i
dont
mind
the
balance
of
yeast
malt
alcohol
and
earthiness
here
it
comes
together
fairly
well
this
is
the
2010
vintage
and
pours
a
dark

hue
which
leaves
a

overall
this
is
a
great
beer
pretty
unique
too
gets
those
lovely
aged
english
barleywine
flavours
with
none
of
the
cloying
sweetness
or
booze
which
while
there
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
then
adds
some
of
that
funky
cheesiness
of

pretty

everything

makes
is
awesome

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
probably
an
older

as
the

are
hardly
evident
quite
enjoyable
though
regardless
super
interesting
beer
that
is
really
difficult
to
deconstruct
does
become
hard
going
towards
the
end
though
with
one
definitely
enough
in
a
session
o
i
would
like
to
thank
the
stranger
in
the
beer
store
who
picked
this
up
and
placed
it
in
my
cart
with
the
stern
warning
that
i
avoid
trying
this
beer
at
my
peril
it
is
in
fact
a
magnificently
constructed
and
executed
christmas
ale
one
whose
strength
lies
in
challenging
conceptions
of
a
belgian
christmas
beer
who
says
they
have
to
be
dark
highly
recommended
despite
the
relatively
high
price
point
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
ale
o
not
too
drinkable
due
to
high
alcohol
and
unbalanced
caramel
o
meh
far
too
sweet
and
uninteresting
for
my
tastes
its
not
awful
though
i
think
ive
just
had
too
many
great
ultradry
beers
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
struise
makes
a
lot
of
good
stuff
and
this
is
no
exception
i
will
also
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
in
the
reserva
as
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
have
muted
some
of
the
complexities
and
mellowed
it
out
a
little
too
much
in
the
end
these
were
both
fun
to
check

opened

as
it

pleasant
and
somewhat
different
flavor
for
a

i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
c
overall
a
really
interesting
brew
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
a
nice
dimension
to
be
in
a
solid
holiday
offering
i
poured
from
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
and
it
was
a
gusher
the
beer
was
too
heady
murky
lots
of
floaters
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
sweet
the
beer
was
too
spicy
for
my
liking
i
could
not
place
what
spice
it
was
but
there
was
too
much
of
it
the
beer
had
a
lingering
finish
and
noticeable
heat
the
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
and
noticeable
alcohol
the
spiciness
was
not
for
me
d
yet
another
fine
beer
from
this
brewery
looks
good
the
smells
and
taste
are
well
balanced
integrated
and
transition
sublimely
with
the
mouthfeel
perfectly
offsetting
it
all
what
more
can
you
ask
for
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
little
bit
different
from
what
i
was
thinking
going
into
it
thanks
to
sliverx
for
sending
in
the
10sme
bif
o
flavors
are
quite
good
and
feel
is
opulent
too
bad
for
the
cloudy
fallout
and
a
strong
but
onedimensional
nose
i
dont
know
how
much
time
is
right
for
aging
this
beer
but
at
3
years
in
the
cellar
and
with
over
a
year
to
go
before
the
best
before
date
ill
deem
this
ideal
for
drinking
right
now
yep
my
overall
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
so
be
it
i
see
this
around
occasionally
and
gladly
have
one
again
pretty
right
on
for
the
style
nicely
made
i
look
forward
to
the
reserva
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
which
belies
the
strong
alcohol
kick
in
a
word
deceptive
strong
lightly
sweet
malt
on
the
initial
sip
this
lingers
through
the
aftertaste
joining
this
is
an
increasing
level
of
bitterness
and
warming
alcohol
still
this
is
a
tale
of
sweet
barley
wineish
malt
if
you
like
that
style
you
will
likely
love
this
what
ive
had
this
before
and
did
not
recognize
this
beer
at
all
i
wasnt
even
close
on
the
style
this
is
all
kinds
of
crazy
is
there
any
wild
yeast
in
here
intentionally
i
dont
get
many
of
the
spices
but
maybe
they
all
come
through
as
different
flavors
this
is
an
amazing
blind
beer
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
the
belgian
esters
but
going
back
i
could
see
this
with
kind
of
a
tripelbspa
base
i
do
love
me
some
urbain
beers
though
cheers
o
a
different
take
on
a
belgian
christmas
beer
but
still
very
enjoyable
well
made
i
was
glad
to
find
this
on
sale
post
christmas
because
the
regular
8
pricetag
is
none
to
pretty
overall
bspa
are
not
my
favorite
style
that
said
this
struise
rendition
is
absolutely
delicious
i
hope
to
have
it
again
next
christmas
or
if
i
am
lucky
the
oak
aged
version
im
usually
not
a
pale
ale
fan
but
this
was
very
good
medium
in
body
with
light
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
could
have
gone
for
two
of
these
recommended
overall
this
is
a
very
strong
boozy
holiday
ale
i
enjoyed
it
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
mixed
with
ruby
hues
and
a
foamy
white
head
that
receded
quite
a
bit
aroma
of
candi
sugar
cherries
and
wet
grass
taste
of
sweet
malts
bing
cherries
grape
skins
followed
by
some
funky
yeast
and
an
appropriate
dose
of
hop
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
nicely
drinkable
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
bottle
notes
that
this
beer
is
brewed
with
herbs
and
spices
but
im
not
picking
up
much
in
that
regard
perhaps
the
flavors
have
faded
a
bit
over
time
seeing
as
how
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
id
like
to
try
it
again
fresh
someday
picked
up
this
2010
vintage
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
hazy
amberorange
pour
with
one
finger
head
decent
retention
nice
lacing
and
lots
of
floaties
the
nose
is
very
unique
and
hard
to
pin
down
im
getting
sweet
and
sour
notes
with
hints
of
orange
peel
caramel
grass
and
a
touch
of
clove
as
it
warmed
it
really
opened
up
very
complex
spicy
taste
with
hints
of
butterscotch
caramel
orange
peel
lemon
apricots
and
alcohol
as
with
the
nose
the
taste
really
morphs
as
it
warms
slightly
boozy
but
it
doesnt
really
hurt
the
drinkability
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
nice
tangy
bitter
bite
headed
to
the
o
b
e
r
kerstbierfestival
in
a
few
weeks
and
cant
wait
to
try
this
fresh
another
great
offering
from
struise
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
beer
is
excellent
very
complex
and
balancedso
many
different
flavors
going
on
but
all
meld
together
nicely
usually
the
belgian
yeast
just
completely
overwhelms
everything
else
not
here
though
the
10
abv
is
also
very
well
hidden
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
overall
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
style
my
initial
reaction
was
not
overly
enthusiastic
but
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
as
the
bottle
progressed
i
would
be
interested
to
try
it
again
certainly
o
i
dont
know
what
happened
here
this
beer
has
been
cellared
properly
for
two
years
and
things
didnt
really
come
together
perhaps
this
was
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
it
was
not
handled
as
well
as
i
thought
it
was
regardless
this
beer
came
off
as
a
muddled
mess
ill
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
impressions
change
this
thing
is
smooth
and
dry
slight
carbonation
is
present
the
flavor
has
some
caramel
maltiness
and
honeyish
sweetness
plus
a
distinct
spicy
character
a
little
cinnamon
is
in
there
along
with
notes
of
candied
fruit
akin
to
a
rumsoaked
christmas
cake
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
some
lingering
bitterness
still
an
extremely
flavorful
satisfying
bier
though
a
touch
pricey
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
for
when
the
weather
gets
real
cold
around
here
prosit
1403
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
o
give
me
more
delicious
and
complex
i
see
myself
drinking
this
nightly
in
the
dead
of
winter
really
outstanding
o
very
good
belgian
strong
ale
defintely
a
sipper
at
10
abv
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
cinnamon
dark
fruit
and
some
coriander
in
the
taste
cinnamon
sweet
orange
citrus
and
coriander
a
spice
like
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
spice
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
and
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
o
this
a
good
stuff
it
s
a
complex
thirst
quencher
that
you
can
also
enjoy
after
a
good
meal
in
the
morning
just
out
of
bed
in
the
evening
at
work
etc
i
just
cant
wait
to
try
the
reserva
version
pours
a
cloudy
yellowbrown
decent
head
which
fades
quickly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
really
interesting
and
hard
to
describe
hoppy
and
malty
on
the
tongue
definitely
tasting
the
spices
as
well
alcohol
warms
you
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
damn
good
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
golden
with
some
suspended
sediment
and
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
very
sweet
with
an
explosion
of
orange
juice
spice
and
some
alcoholic
heat
tastes
a
bit
like
a
spiced
screwdriver
very
tangy
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
bitterness
is
interlaced
with
the
juicy
and
sweet
malt
notes
i
swear
i
taste
vodka
here
very
strange
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
winter
beer
but
interesting
very
interesting
and
quite
good
its
labeled
as
a
belgian
xmas
ale
brewed
with
spices
luckily
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
traditional
christmas
spices
and
they
didnt
go
over
board
like
most
american
brewers
do
when
they
make
christmas
ales
o
a
really
good
offering
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
o
overall
a
quality
bspa
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
spicing
is
certainly
festive
for
it
as
a
xmas
ale
but
why
not
enjoy
it
in
the
dead
of
summer
booze
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
a
tasty
offering
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
laces
fairly
well
but
doesnt
retain
well
the
aroma
has
notes
of
earthy
hops
and
caramel
malt
as
well
as
some
floral
notes
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
floral
and
caramel
notes
and
then
has
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
smooth
and
finishes
clean
overall
a
good
unique
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
perhaps
too
smooth
for
the
strength
pretty
nice
beer
with
6
months
age
on
it
oone
of
the
lesser
struise
releasesbut
still
a
good
one
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
why
is
this
close
to
10
poured
from
two
different
versions
of
this
brew
one
with
the
stoner
santa
picture
on
the
label
and
another
cleaner
version
with
santa
wearing
sunglasses
into
a
tulip
glass
the
pour
is
a
clear
goldenorange
color
with
a
very
small
layer
of
white
foam
that
quicky
fizzles
away
faint
aroma
of
spices
floral
and
sweet
malts
flavors
are
of
caramel
orange
zest
honey
belgian
candi
sugar
and
toasted
bread
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
to
the
brew
mediumbodied
with
decent
carbonation
throughout
i
was
disappointed
with
this
brew
as
i
expected
more
overall
this
beer
is
very
complex
strong
and
drinkable
it
possesses
the
traits
of
an
excellent
triple
with
a
little
something
extra
from
very
mild
spices
o
good
but
not
my
favorite
i
was
sort
of
let
down
by
this
but
such
is
life
overall
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
paid
way
too
much
for
this
11
2
oz
bottle
of
belgian
xmas
ale
the
main
reason
for
the
purchase
of
this
ale
was
that
many
people
hanging
out
at
the
stone
brewing
sampling
session
have
had
this
ale
and
suggested
it
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
way
through
and
probably
will
never
see
a
bottle
of
this
again
so
am
very
glad
i
bought
and
enjoyed
today
this
belgian
is
very
strong
and
can
say
that
its
style
is
categorized
well
with
belgian
strong
pale
ales
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
nice
spicy
christmas
ale
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
shade
bit
too
boozyother
than
that
soft
fruity
spicy
and
hoppy
all
at
once
well
done
overall
pretty
nice
overall
presentation
good
oneoff
take
on
the
style
drinkability
and
overall
impression
as
a
holiday
season
spiced
tripel
i
think
this
one
works
well
im
finding
each
sip
a
pleasure
to
take
and
will
be
regret
seing
the
end
of
the
beer
i
could
see
having
this
again
from
the
next
batch
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
wellmade
imaginative
beer
that
explores
some
new
ground
and
does
it
quite
well
however
im
thinking
this
is
not
a
good
beer
for
aging
in
that
with
the
eventual
fading
of
the
hop
bitterness
what
will
remain
is
the
sweetness
while
it
is
a
complex
sweetness
if
there
isnt
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
terminate
it
at
the
end
the
sweetness
will
probably
be
cloying

not

the

went
really
well
with

i
wish
more

call
this
drinkable
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
zip
helps
in
that
department
nothing
wowing
but
a
well
made
sipper
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
kills
this
i
can
get
past
the
taste
as
maybe
it
was
due
to
the
tapline
but
the
mouthfeel
is
all
the
responsibility
of
the
beer
a
shame
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
d
too
strong
to
want
more
than
one
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
on
clearance
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
think
that
at
the
full
10bottle
price
would
have
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
no
pun
intended
i
think
i
have
liked
everything
i
have
tried
from
the
sturdy
brewers
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
at
10
abv
it
is
doubtful
if
you
will
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
strong
noble
hop
aromas
mixed
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
some
belgian
sugars
and
a
touch
of
funkiness
all
rolled
into
one
here
with
this
brew
this
has
quite
a
bit
of
funky
haylike
earthiness
present
in
the
flavors
as
well
sweet
and
funk
mixed
tigether
lingering
dry
noble
hop
presence
on
the
finish
as
well
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
upper
echelon
drinkability
very
good
beer
but
the
high
abv
would
lead
to
a
short
session
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
creamy
carbonation
up
front
which
helps
out
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
hints
of
pepper
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pepermint
countered
by
a
slight
medicinal
feel
as
well
as
the
berry
and
light
fruit
notes
found
in
the
aroma
the
abv
is
well
masked
and
this
one
disappears
from
the
glass
quickly
the
spices
and
the
oddness
combined
make
this
a
once
in
a
while
like
christmas
type
of
beer
to
enjoy
while
listening
to
coast
to
coast
am
the
flavours
somehow
blend
into
a
fantastic
tasting
beer
each
sip
being
slightly
different
from
the
last
one
it
is
more
of
a
barleywine
than
a
anything
else
but
whatever
style
you
choose
to
put
it
in
it
is
a
wonderful
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
malty
feeling
other
that
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
it
is
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
heavy
and
not
really
inviting
if
the
flavor
were
more
interesting
it
would
be
more
drinkable
but
its
not
the
alcohol
is
forward
enough
that
id
never
consider
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
and
the
bitterness
is
strong
enough
to
reinforce
that
decision
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
have
again
just
not
at
a
bar
i
gulped
this
quick
and
felt
it
strong
beer
here
i
know
some
reserva
jeesus
is
on
tap
in
the
area
now
imma
have
to
go
find
that
this
is
drinkable
yet
a
bit
to
big
for
its
own
good
the
taste
is
simple
enough
to
fit
style
but
with
a
sweet
kick
d
once
during
the
christmas
or
holiday
season
is
good
for
me
a
very
nice
bspa
but
8
49
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
is
a
little
steep
for
any
beer
d
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
a
nice
treat
on
a
cold
night
a
bug
abv
and
towards
the
end
you
do
start
to
fell
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
warms
quite
nicely
as
it
goes
down
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
on
this
christmas
eve
eve
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
heavy
bitterness
and
astringency
overpower
it
although
the
booze
is
typical
for
10
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
decent
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
enjoyable
bright
somewhere
in
the
land
between
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
a
trip
a
bit
fluffy
with
carbonation
spices
predominate
but
not
in
a
spices
added
sort
of
way
rather
brewing
process
spice
flavor
not
as
much
sweetness
as
i
expected
with
less
belgian
candy
sugar
notes
than
often
encountered
here
d
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
at
10
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
it
is
a
powerful
bpatriple
according
to
the
de
struise
brewers
but
one
that
i
will
visit
repeatedly
each
year
cheers
jd
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
at
times
it
seems
a
bit
watery
overall
this
brew
seems
a
bit
young
with
a
green
yeastiness
playing
a
big
portion
in
the
flavor
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
ackward
not
much
present
in
this
brew
to
give
it
a
real
christmas
beer
feel
outside
of
the
label
the
young
yeast
taste
mixed
with
the
herbal
flavors
was
a
strange
combination
alcohol
very
well
hidden
nicely
done
d
very
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
good
lace
as
the
head
settles
caramel
spice
and
a
malty
nose
medium
mouthfeel
apricot
like
fruit
like
flavors
along
with
some
belgian
yeast
flavors
lingering
bitterness
no
real
alocohol
notes
prevalant
overall
a
tasty
little
beverage
overall
not
a
bad
trippel
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
one
a
bit
dry
for
me
but
overall
i
like
it
and
think
it
is
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
great
malty
and
fruity
flavors
spicing
is
welldone
and
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
my
only
quip
is
the
excessive
amount
of
sediment
that
never
settled
down
beyond
that
its
a
fabulous
holiday
beer
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
do
no
wrong
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
given
its
strength
although
the
alcohol
content
is
well
masked
making
this
rather
drinkable
superbeer
this
is
yet
another
tasty
and
unique
offering
from
the
struise
gang
and
for
a
holiday
offering
its
very
different
from
the
typical
overspiced
herbal
winter
warmer
crap
that
roils
me
more
than
pumpkin
beers
but
i
digress
d
the
sign
of
a
quality
beer
that
is
full
of
flavour
and
aromas
another
top
beer
from
de
struise
served
in
an
allagash
flute
cloudy
murky
orange
brown
smell
has
peaches
apricots
sour
cherries
and
oranges
but
it
has
an
overall
dank
muskiness
to
it
pretty
interesting
taste
like
a
mixture
of
orange
peach
and
cherry
juice
with
belgian
yeasty
funk
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
orange
juice
slightly
thick
and
a
bit
syrupy
alcoho
is
well
hidden
making
this
easy
drinking
notes
best
before
dec
2014
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery

and
spiced
flavors
mix
around
well
along
with
the
golden

wonderful
beer
that
would
drink
well
all
year
long
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
definitely
recommend

sometimes
you
can
find
this
on
sale
in
denver
for
under
7
more
citrus
than
the
reserva
this
wouldve
really
hit
the
spot
in
winter
but
its
doing
the
trick
here
in
may
what
the
hell
style
is
this
anyway
i
first
read
blonde
christmas
ale
somewhere
hmmm
a
10
blonde
ale
called
a
belgian
strong
pale
here
and
an
abbey
tripel
on
ratebeer
i
guess
it
really
doesnt
matter
its
good
super
smooth
mellow
balanced
and
complex
a
treat
nice
xmas
style
brew
more
of
a
nightcapper
drinkability
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
no
prolonged
affairs
no
need
to
rush
it
this
one
is
for
savoring
enjoy
it
after
a
good
meal
it
makes
for
the
perfect
nightcap
d
not
a
bad
belgian
nice
body
but
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
the
smell
and
taste
as
bready
malts
dominated
them
would
give
another
chance
hmm
maybe
i
did
a
boo
boo
dint
decant
the
bottle
thereby
pouring
the
yeastoids
into
the
head
and
perhaps
altering
my
perceptions
anyway
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
light
tan
head
that
mostly
subsided
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
with
chunks
medium
to
dark
brownish
amber
nose
is
very
yeasty
malt
spice
and
a
little
vineous
flavors
about
the
same
with
some
citrus
tang
at
the
end
real
easy
drinking
and
belies
the
strength
great
finish
of
the
flavors
round
mouth
filling
body
and
great
carbonation
easy
to
get
schnockered
on
this
and
happy
to
do
so
d
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
pretty
quickly
in
both
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
with
some
time
for
the
alcohol
to
mellow
it
could
become
far
more
drinkable
d
a
beer
to
keep
in
an
arsenal
of
belgian
standards
very
enjoyable
pours
a
two

that
fades

at

for

from
tullys

wine
wells
me
another
smooth
drinker
from
struise
how
does
urbain
do
it
ive
heard
its
in
the
yeast
d
highly
drinkable
dangerously
drinkable
as
it
is
10
well
balanced
not
what
you
would
think
as
a
christmas
brew
but
it
is
a
nice
belgian
strong
definitely
one
to
have
a
few
of
or
even
just
enjoy
one
md
very
dry
light
and
crisply
carbonated
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
d
at
10
abv
this
brew
is
meant
to
sip
and
enjoy
it
isnt
bad
overall
but
the
dry
wheatiness
of
the
character
dropped
it
down
a
notch
for
me
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
i
think
that
chunky
is
a
good
descriptor
for
the
liquid
the
head
is
a
persistent
white
froth
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
doughy
but
dominated
by
fruits
apricot
peach
and
even
red
apple
are
present
there
is
also
a
very
slight
tinge
of
red
wine
vinegar
and
alcohol
it
is
slightly
sweet
with
the
pitted
fruits
coming
through
the
alcohol
burns
nicely
and
there
are
lightly
bitter
and
sour
notes
on
the
finish
we
have
a
full
body
with
a
sticky
texture
the
carbonation
is
average
and
the
finish
is
long
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
complexity
doesnt
really
pull
through
on
the
palate
but
i
think
that
this
beer
will
age
well
for
quite
a
while
m
thin
low
carbonation
clean
with
the
exception
of
struisse
witte
i
have
had
nothing
but
outstanding
beer
from
de
struisse
brouwers
tsjeeses
belgian
xmas
ale
is
a
bold
and
beautifully
spiced
tripel
that
will
almost
certainly
appeal
to
any
belgian
beer
lovers
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
make
its
acquaintance
poured
into
a
snifter
with
a
finger
thick
head
that
shrinks
to
thin
lace
relatively
quickly
smells
really
good
lots
of
fruit
specifically
pear
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
strong
of
alcohol
the
malt
and
yeast
flavors
are
hard
to
detect
because
of
the
boozyness
the
mouthfeel
is
normal
for
the
style
maybe
more
carbonated
than
i
would
prefer
this
beer
looks
and
smells
amazing
but
the
taste
isnt
that
good
ill
try
another

oh
i
didnt

there
any
d
nice

in
any

sense
could
see
me
trying
330cl

b
bottled
909
in
a

it
was

the
taste
was
orange

the
peppery
taste
persisted
for
quite
some
time
and
made
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
harsh
side
enjoyable
enough
but
one
and
done
for
me
d
a
drinkable
beer
i
dont
really
see
what
makes
it
a
christmas
brew
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beeralthough
you
definitely
become
aware
of
the
alcohol
content
when
you
stand
up
to
get
another
will
try
to
get
back
to
the
store
and
buy
what
is
left
on
the
shelf
as
it
is
likely
limitedtime
available
the
brewers
insist
that
the
name
tsjeeses
loosely
pronounced
as
cheeses
or
jesus
is
meant
more
as
an
expression
of
stupefaction
than
a
curse
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
beer
so
well
crafted
that
i
wouldnt
scoff
at
the
idea
of
placing
it
up
there
amongst
belgiums
best
tripels
and
golden
ales
with
offerings
like
this
its
no
wonder
people
have
begun
making
the
pilgrimage
to
vleteren
to
see
the
messiah
they
call
tsjeeses
err
i
mean
urbain
d
it
was
very
special
to
drink
this
one
with
the
master

you
know
youre
getting
your
full
serving
of
alcohol
with
this
oneit
damn
nears
knocks
you
on
your
head
taste
has
notes
of
bread
and
jam
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
is
somewhere
between
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
a
tripel
almost
makes
me
think
of
a
blend
of
maudite
and
la
fin
du
mondethough
its
more
mellow
than
each
of
those
it
may
just
be
me
tonight
but
despite
the
apparent
high
alcohol
content
of
the
first
few
sips
its
going
down
quicklya
nicely
drinkable
winter
brew
goes
great
with
the
cheese
crackers
and
deli
meat
ive
paired
it
with
drinkiability
is
good
here
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
for
such
a
high
abv
drink
something
of
a
disappointment
really
i
would
prefer
more
of
a
statment
go
for
the
fruitmalt
or
go
for
the
bitter
this
one
is
not
balanced
sufficiently
to
really
be
a
pleasing
drink
pours
a
lovely
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
lot
of
tiny
goobers
floating
in
it
and
a
very
thick

off

yeasty

had
again
with
urbain
at
de
struise
and
my
score
is
higher
d
really
this
is
a
10
abv
beer
cant
tell
well
hidden
really
liked
this
one
will
search
out
more
also
has
a
subtle
honey
sweetness
with
a
real
creamy
head
and
body
that
follows
it
through
to
the
end
some
spices
come
through
on
the
back
end
followed
by
a
grainy
somewhat
dry
malt
that
allows
the
beer
to
flow
through
uninhibited
d
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
despite
the
10
abv
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
perfect
5
on
the
drinkability
scale
is
the
knowledge
of
high
alcohol
levels
and
the
inebriation
to
follow
with
overimbibing
this
is
terrific
stuff
d
wow
10
this
doesnt
taste
like
it
has
any
alcohol
very
drinkable
in
that
regard
but
im
not
sure
id
love
the
flavor
all
night
long
mfd
the
feel
was
a
bit
thick
if
anything
coupled
with
a
low
carbonation
level
or
maybe
one
that
is
just
not
very
crisp
made
the
brew
seem
even
thicker
the
drinkablity
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
if
my
wife
wants
to
buy
me
another
i
gladly
drink
it
again
i
might
even
buy
one
myself
overall
what
is
happening
this
evening
do
i
start
to
like
triples
my
second
tripel
this
evening
and
the
one
second
i
feel
in
love
with
so
many
tastelayers
fantastic
highly
recommendable
draught
at
the
trappist
had
this
side
by
side
with
pannepot
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
liked
this
much
better
amazing
beer
and
the
best
tripel
that
ive
had
yet
orangegold
with
a
creamy
head
incredibly
expressive
fruity
aroma
with
lots
of
peach
pineapple
apricot
and
apple
along
with
some
yeasty
spiciness
the
flavor
is
just
an
awesome
balance
of
fruit
spice
and
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
smooth
bubbles
im
dying
to
try
the
reserva
now
d
drinkability
was
decent
while
the
enjoyment
factor
was
good
very
boozy
and
delivers
quite
a
bite
makes
this
a
slow
winter
sipper
the
10abv
is
well
noted
and
will
keep
your
humble
throughout
the
course
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
a
good
attempt
at
a
lighter
christmas
beer

a
shot

more
delicious
beer
from
de

quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
belgian
or
otherwise
i
cannot
wait
til
they
are
brewing
authentic
belgian
beer
in
maine
awesome
for
now
ill
settle
for
the
imports
happily
pours
a
rusty
amber
with
a
good
ring
of
white
head
dies
relatively
quickly
nice
aroma
of
fruits
and
spices
raisins
flavors
here
all
meld
together
quite
nicely
lots
of
spiced
rum
and
fruit
flavors
a
bit
hot
almost
like
what
i
would
think
a
belgian
barleywine
to
be
which
kind
of
makes
sense
as
this
i
guess
is
an
interpretation
of
a
winter
beer
or
seasonal
although
ive
seen
it
around
all
year
sticky
thick
mouthfeel
a
nice
strong
sipper
would
be
excellent
on
a
winter
night
but
is
quite
ripe
right
now
in
the
spring
taste
is
complex
and
varies
between
fruits
orange
pear
peach
kiwi
wow
some
heavy
spicing
going
on
here
as
well
nice
solid
backbone
to
this
one
as
well
some
candied
ginger
round
out
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
bigger
than
i
expected
dry
but
strangely
metallic
on
the
finish
one
is
plenty
for
me
for
tonite
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
well
balanced
beer
enjoyable
but
slightly
bothered
by
the
aluminum
foil
on
filling
finish
tsjeeses
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
could
be
very
very
good
beer
with
a
couple
of
small
tweaks
tone
down
the
sweet
flavor
and
the
abv
this
beer
would
be
more
than
good
at
8
its
just
too
much
as
it
is
despite
those
two
gripes
it
still
manages
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
de
struisse
has
done
better
but
its
still
far
from
bad
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
even
if
only
once
thanks
brady
id
have
this
more
often
if
it
wasnt
so
darned
expensive
oh
well
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumtofull
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
this
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian
spice
beer
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
pint
and
possibly
two
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
another
fine
ale
from
de
struise
pours
a
glowing
cedar
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cover
nose
is
quite
complex
with
ripe
fruits
rich
candy
malts
peppery
belgian
yeast
well
balanced
spices
honey
and
tart

taste
is
also
quite
rich
a
delicous
blend
of
sour
fruits
sweet
bready
malts
spices
subtle
hops
and
funky
yeast
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
good
stuff
very
unique
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
the
extra
little
bit
of
spiciness
differentiates
this
one
from
some
of
the
other
belgians
ive
had
lately
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
is
barely
detectable
really
one
to
savor
and
enjoy
wow
ill
be
back
for
more
next
holiday
season
12oz
bottle
on
sale

jesus
is
smoking
it
smells
spicy
and
herbal
sort
of
like
a
fantome
its
got
a
dark
orange
color
and
yeasties
floating
throughout
despite
a
sincere
attempt
at
a
careful
pour
tastes
like
i
dont
know
what
good
but
spicy
and
mysterious
again
reminds
me
of
a
fantome
drinkability
uh
not
bad
not
great
its
just
kind
of
an
overly
sweet
brew
that
looks
beautiful
smells
soso
and
tastes
soso
its
a
bit
much
for
my
tastes
add
another
to
the
list
of
winter
warmers
that
i
didnt
much
enjoy
drinkability
either
im
sensing
sweetness
a
bit
too
much
lately
or
ive
just
got
a
run
of
really
sugared
brews
this
one
works
better
than
some
of
the
recent
ones
i
have
had
though
a
bit
steep
at
the
7
or
8
i
paid
for
it
an
exemplary
beer
delicious
tasty
but
not
likely
to
buy
again
at
10
the
label
controversy
is
a
joke
but
the
beer
inside
is
anything
but
its
not
as
much
blended
as
notched
together
creatively
and
with
a
healthy
spirit
it
speaks
of
spice
and
while
clove
is
the
only
obvious
culprit
its
the
crisp
close
that
mitigates
a
muscular
abv
so
have
no
shame
take
off
those
glasses
and
let
the
partay
begin
despite
the
astringency
in
the
feel
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
10
abv
pours
peachy
golden
with
very
white
topping
and
lace
on
the
way
down
some
spiciness
in
the
nose
and
certainly
in
the
taste
as
cinammon
and
sugar
and
cardamon
impart
sweetness
livey
carbonation
that
adds
to
mouthfeel

tasty
and

was
quite
unique

checking
out

worth

of

for
a
high
abv
it
was
hardly
noticeable
very
easy
to
drink
sipper
for
sure
glad
it
was
in
a
snifter
or
i
would
have
sucked
it
down
pretty
fast
the
beer
was
a
moderately
cloudy
orange
tending
towards
amber
the
smell
was
wonderful
full
of
spice
and
yeast
flavors
the
taste
was
complex
and
up
front
without
being
overpowering
it
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
wanted
it
to
be
d
not
bad
i
think
i
like
this
more
than
the
others
i
tasted
it
with
d
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
you
can
definitely
feel
it
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
one
of
the
more
unique
and
interesting
christmas
beers
ive
had
another
example
of
why
struise
is
in
the
vanguard
of
modern
brewing
solid
de
struise
offering
a
nice
seasonal
to
mix
things
up
with
drinkablility
good
body
is
light
and
airy
yet
not
foamy
its
just
perfect
to
convey
the
myriad
flavors
held
within
the
beer
even
though
this
is
billed
as
a
10
winter
ale
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
a
pleasant
change
from
the
usual
slate
of
dark
overspiced
holiday
ales
overall
an
outstanding
strong
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
belgian
brews
ive
had
for
quite
a
while
rusty
orange
color
tan
foam
initially
that
fades
to
a
skim
later
on
tiny
dark
suspended
particles
candied
fruit
and
alcohol
in
the
aroma
which
can
be
overlooked
as
a
belgian
xmas
ale
strong
rich
flavors
caramel
stewed
fruit
very
mild
spice
level
alcohol
seems
to
be
lurking
at
the
edges
reinforcing
that
this
is
a
slow
sipper
dry
finish
with
lingering
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
some
vegetal
hop
character
that
i
cant
really
endorse
or
veto
it
reminded
me
of
a
homebrew
i
had
once
but
not
in
an
amateur
sense
at
all
one
and
done
this
was
worth
a
try
pours
a
fully
clouded
brown
hued
orange
thin
white
head
nose
is
a
touch
of
honey
melon
sugar
and
sweet
tones
flavor
bring
a
thick
level
of
spices
sweet
tones
and
a
bit
of
honey
but
the
sweetest
side
rides
highest
here
feel
is
pretty
smooth
on
the
liquid
and
fairly
low
on
the
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
ale
but
if
you
dont
like
the
sweeter
belgian
ales
you
probably
wont
be
able
to
appreciate
this
as
much
fine
and
dandy
full
bodied
with
big
carbonation
that
matches
the
style
nicely
good
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
middle

all
fruit
and
spice
cherry
berry
and
citrus
make
for
a
pecuilar
combination

slightly
sweet
with

notes
with
some
spices
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
quite
different
i
picked
up
an
11
2oz
bottle
at
champanes
in
warren
for
6
99
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
to
date
the
label
shows
a
stoned
guy
in
a
santa
hat
it
couldnt
be
jesus
theres
no
way
its
a
picture
of
a
stoned
jesus
but
with
the
name
tsjeeses
im
starting
to
think
its
jesus
after
all
the
beer
is
completely
hazed
dark
orange
color
lots
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
it
might
have
been
less
hazy
if
i
didnt
pour
it
all
in
one
go
the
head
was
composed
of
big
bubbles
and
receded
within
30
seconds
the
smell
is
very
belgian
with
sweet
candy
yeasty
esters
and
some
cough
syrup
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
carolus
brews
aromas
the
taste
is
sweet
and
a
little
alcoholic
lots
of
fruits
in
the
aftertaste
the
bottle
claims
spices
herbs
and
noble
hops
but
i
couldnt
pinpoint
any
spices
with
accuracy
mostly
this
is
a
strong
pale
ale
very
belgian
in
character
not
the
spiced
christmas
beer
as
i
was
expecting
the
body
is
very
thick
and
syrupy
and
combined
with
the
evident
abv
this
is
a
sipper
final
judgment
good
beer
too
expensive
though
overall
pretty
good
beer
hazy
cider
color
with
an
unappealing
suspension
of
yeast
particulate
guess
i
overpoured
it
fairly
prominent
foamy
head
smells
of
tart
fruit
and
spices
tastes
more
of
the
same
apple
grape
honey
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
but
ample
soft
carbonation
prevents
this
from
being
syrupy
pretty
good
drinkability
factor
on
this
one
despite
the
abv
my
biggest
knock
is
the
exorbitant
9
i
spent
for
this
bottle
this
will
be
a
once
a
year
treat
for
me
drinkability
great
however
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
good
god
was
this
pricey
very
impressive
i
would
say
this
is
a
standout
beer
d
interesting
complex
beer
very
well
balanced
nice
combination
of
sweet
candied
fruits
with
sour
lemon
apple
brett
like
quality
drinkability
is
really
good
wow
i
was
so
busy
enjoying
this
i
realized
i
hadnt
been
typing
much
of
a
review
in
fact
its
so
good
that
im
not
going
to
bother
disceting
further
and
just
enjoy
abv
is
well
hidden
unique
for
a
noel
i
dig
the
fact
that
its
a
pale
and
not
overly
spiced
they
could
have
called
this
a
belgian
ipa
and
it
would
be
a
standout
in
the
category
still
like
most
de
struise
offerings
its
overpriced
but
on
the
lower
end
of
their
spectrum
at
least
after
a
careful
not
to
disturb
the
sediment
pour
but
with
just
enough
umph
to
try
and
get
maximum
head
i
get
no
head
just
a
little
quick
foam
in
my
goose
island
wine
glass
lovely
nectar
of
life
colored
amber
with
quite
a
bit
of
suspension
in
their
too
cant
see
any
bubling
though
very
yeasty
fruits
in
the
nose
with
a
little
swirl
some
mangoey
like
hop
characteristcs
swirl
around
their
as
well
tropical
fruits
abound
at
the
forefront
of
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
bitter
some
of
those
brewers
gold
hops
shining
through
i
suppose
long
yeasty
linger
after
each
sip
too
dry
fruity
palated
beer
with
a
bit
of
chewyness
pours
a
nice
orange
golden
with
big
fluffy
white
head
that
disovles
smells
of
yeast
orange
ginger
other
spices
tastes
of
citrus
little
alc
noted
nice
balance
good
amount
of
carbonation
yet
a
slight
creamy
body
to
it
extremely
drinkable
for
a
10
alc
nice
xmas
treat
it
was
great
with
pork
as
well
as
bleu
cheese
had
great
expectations
for
this
brew
and
was
very
pleased
rather
expensive
at
10
99
for
a
330
ml
bottle
golden
bronze
colored
ale
with
a
beautiful
head
of
white
creamy
foam
flavor
is
elegant
and
well
structured
loaded
with
depth
and
nuance
very
sweet
well
layered
and
complex
with
well
concentrated
flavors
from
start
to
finish
notes
of
peach
and
pear
elegant
mouth
fell
purely
belgian
in
every
way
wow
wow
wow
stunning
i
dont
like
my
christmas
ales
overly
spicy
so
thats
probably
why
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
the
only
thing
that
hurts
this
beer
is
the
price
it
was
expensive
on
draft
and
its
expensive
in
a
bottle
you
dont
much
for
your
money
is
it
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
yeah
i
would
say
thats
it
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
this
beer
would
make
for
a
great
christmas
treat
tm
nicely
carbonated
very
smooth
and
slick
with
a
hinth
of
prickliness
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
lots
of
honey
and
nutmeg
cinnamon
orangepeel
fading
to
a
nice
malty
sweetness
and
then
a
bready
ness
finish
has
some
hops
coming
through
tsjeeses
pours
an
awkward
orangey
brown
ruby
burgundy
color
thick
with
small
suspended
floats
and
a
small
peachy
white
head
very
winey
in
the
nose
grape
skin
green
apple
orange
peel
fresh
earthy
hops
sweet
alcohol
soaked
grain
and
evergreen
alcohol
heat
is
pretty
pronounced
in
this
one
but
it
also
allows
the
herbal
leafy
hop
character
to
take
center
stage
it
too
becomes
dominant
shoving
the
malts
into
the
passenger
seat
subtle
wintery
pepper
spice
and
estery
yeast
is
not
over
done
but
i
wish
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
was
more
apparent
tsjeeses
is
a
sipper
for
sure
and
most
definitely
a
holiday
treat
i
still
felt
yearning
for
more
of
a
wow
factor
after
the
9
glass
was
through
d
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
paid
9
99
for
one
330cl
bottle
330
ml
bottle
from
the

out
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
a
very
nice
aroma
of
apples
some
spices
and
a
lot
of
woody
notes
the
taste
was
very
nice
sort
of
a
warm
and
mellow
brew
citrus
flavors
apples
a
dry
yeasty
flavor
full
of
mellow
barrel
aged
aspects
very
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
it
was
much
more
flavorful
and
fruity
drink
it
at
12
degrees
maybe
more
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
overall
a
very
solid
and
very
different
take
on
the
holiday
belgian
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
i
felt
the
hops
were
rightfully
placed
and
no
where
near
overdone
smooth
and
rich
i
am
going
to
have
to
go
buy
another
one
of
these
as
quick
as
i
can

likes
d
really
very
good
i
really
had
to
hunt
hard
to
detect
any
of
the
supposed
10
that
this
baby
is
packing
pretty
dry
and
crisp
yet
quite
juicy
and
sticky
thoroughly
enjoyable
taste
is
brrrr
oxidized
cardboard
whiffs
i
have
to
be
strong
underneath
here
is
a
good
beer
or
need
i
say
was
very
spicy
with
bitter
orange
zest
and
other
bitter
spices
warm
alcohol
is
not
helping
drinkability
malt
is
thin
and
i
suspect
a
good
addition
of
sugar
this
is
probably
a
good
beer
when
fresh
but
de
struise
brouwers
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
oxidation
during
brewing
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
copper
plenty

a
bit

lemon
tartness

some

peaches

mouthfeel

from
the
sugars
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
is
somewhat
sharp
peppery
and
dry
feel
in
the

a
very
interesting
beer
quite
tasty
and
very
well
balanced

its

with
a

foamy

with
perfect

and
some
great
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
peach
ester
with
a
spicy
peppery

taste
is
also
a
mix
between
the
very
nice

and
the
peppery
yeast
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nonetheless
sampled
at
the
kierstbierfestival
in
essen
belgium
a
few
weeks
back
the
beer
poured
a
bronze
color
into
my
snifter
with
a
slight
off
white
head
there
was
a
port
like
nose
to
the
beer
high
abv
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
hot
alcoholy
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
was
all
i
got
the
taste
was
also
a
bit
citrusy
with
some
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
as
well
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
an
interesting
beer
and
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
a
holiday
beer
one
usually
sees
heavy
sweeter
malt
character
in
these
types
of
beers
the
simple
malt
character
is
actually
quite
nice
and
accentuates
a
different
side
of
the
spices
than
one
usually
sees
in
a
holiday
beer
at
times
the
spice
notes
and
the
fruitiness
seem
like
they
should
be
disparate
but
they
are
not
in
fact
this
beer
is
quite
well
integrated
quite
complex
most
definitely
tasty
this
beer
is
really
growing
on
my
as
i
slowly
work
my
way
through
this
330ml
bottle
mouthfeel
is
medium

found
on

not

as

still
mighty
tasty
notes
of

unexpected
in

theres
an

of

notes

with

not

a
drinker
this
is
nice
prost
overall
it
took
a
while
for
this
to
make
sense
to
me
it
is
complex
and
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
unravel
what
was
going
on
maybe
too
much
but
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
one
to
savor
and
linger
over

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
marlboro
ma
the
sweetness
dictates
that
this
beer
be
sipped
slowly
and
savored
for
me
this
is
a
very
good
dessert
beer
somewhere
between
a
strong
pale
and
a
triple
in
reality
definetely
a
solid
fruit
forward
belgian
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
pale
but
it
is
worth
trying
a
quality
brew
well
balanced
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
in
the
winter
but
its
a
nice
contrast
to
all
the
ipas
and
imperial
ipas
ive
been
sampling
lately
2012
vintage
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
two
finger
head
that
left
lace
and
stuck
around
a
long
time
for
better
or
worse
a
spicy
and
yeasty
aroma
with
touches
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
as
well
sweet
and
breadlike
malt
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
to
medium
body
there
is
a
liveliness
and
crispness
in
this
beer
thanks
to
some
spice
and
carbonation
and
the
alcoholo
gives
it
a
heated
snap
on
the
finish
the
fruit
flavors
and
malts
are
balanced
and
id
say
you
can
equally
detect
some
plush
tropical
fruit
like
pineapple
with
citric
hoppy
orange
alongside
both
sweet
and
grainy
malts
overall
i
just
found
this
beer
to
hit
the
right
notes
in
terms
of
balance
and
taste
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
dangerous
sipper
dare
i
say
it
but
the
alcohol
burn
masks
this
one
and
really
hurts
the
beer
ever
so
slightly
a
good
spa
but
there
is
better
to
be
had
for
the
price
mf
good
carbonation
medium
to
dry
creamy
with
hints
of
spice
in
the

medium

i
gave
the
2009
bottles
taste
a
3

but
think
i
am
going
to
have
to
up
it
even
though
the
bottle
is
younger
i
am
not
getting
the
hot
sensation
that
i
had
from
the
2009

feels

type
that
gives
you
a

just
sweet
overall
not
my
thing
o
letting
this
beer
develop
really
helped
mellow
the
booziness
the
alcohol
is
slightly
notable
overall
this
beer
did
it
for
me
just
right
i
prefer
the
blue
a
little
more
but
this
one
is
still
on
point
grab
your
favorite
pork
chop
and
give
this
a
go
salud
overall
its
good
i
mean
it
was
always
going
to
be
good
its
good
in
a
standard
comfortable
and
recognisable
way
its
good
so
that
you
know
its
good
and
so
you
cant
disagree
with
the
fact
its
good
its
comfortable
its
warm
its
familiar
the
taste
is
well
balance
with
the
same
characteristics
as
the
smell
with
a
fruity
taste
with
notes
of
apple
pineapple
and
peach
there
are
some
light
cardboard
whiffs
but
very
light
the
malt
is
grainy
and
gives
the
impression
of
wheat
with
slight
musty
taste
the
bitterness
is
low
but
high
enough
to
balance
the
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
body
is
quite
thin
aftertaste
is
pretty
short
with
the
fruitiness
lingering
for
some
time
medium
plus

with
plenty
of

easy
to

with
an
apple

aftertaste
finishes
somewhat
dry

like
most
everything
else
het

this
is
a
great
beer

that
settles

small
dots

slowly
drip

the
remaining

slight
spice
and
some
floral

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
tartness
and
a
sweet
fruity
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
there
is
also
a
slight
numbing
quality
in
the
mouth
that
i
got
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
strong
but
easy
to
drink
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
that
really
made
me
rethink
the
style
has
almost
nothing
in
common
with
the
devil
beers
popped
it
open
because
the
brewery
reccomends
aging
no
more
than
3
years
but
i
think
it
could
go
longer
overall
very
nice
a
very
good
bspa
o
this
is
really
good
with
years
of
age
on
it
i
imagine
it
would
be
just
as
good

bananas
lets
look
at
that
label
copy
now
cuvee
van
de
kaiser
rood
is
brewed
once
a
year
on
the
24th
of
february
on
the
birthday
of
charles
the
fifth
it
is
brewed
in
a
limited
quantity
by
the
anker
brewery
of
mechelen
one
of
the
last
remaining
classic
producers
in
belgium
this
blonde
ale
of
top
fermentation
illustrates
the
subtle
balance
between
the
different
natural
ingredients
bottle
fermented
this
is
a
delicious
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
belgian
flavor
with
just
the
right
hop
had
with
a
chile
relleno
at
beer
kitchen
in
kansas
city
and
it
paired
well
with
the
spiciness
o
this
is
pretty
good
but
kind
of
boozy
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
nice
beer
though
can
see
this
aging
well
o
great
beer
belgian
to
the
bone
bought
this
beer
cold
and
the
review
is
based
on
a
beer
at
about
4040
degrees
as
this
warms
to
between
cellar
and
room
temp
it
completely
changes
not
as
balanced
looses
all
of
the
tart
fruit
still
has
some
pear
but
it
is
not
half
the
brew
it
is
colder
strange
this
is
usually
not
the
case
with
strong
belgians
overall
its
got
a
wonderful
nose
but
i
am
not
feeling
keen
on
this
one
or
desiring
it
ever
again
nice
to
try
it
though
o
a
good
beer
this
highly
quaffable
and
the
10
abv
is
barely
noticeable
i
would
like
a
bit
more
balance
on
this
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
the
fruit
nice
brew
though
2009
vintage
i
had
this
in
a
belgian
brunch
tasting
and
was
my
least
favorite
this
beer
looks
pretty
good
but
i
wonder
if
the
aging
had
cause
it
to
go
too
sweet
i
barely
notice
the
10
abv
on
this
because
it
has
this
overwhelming
brown
sugar
nose
and
taste
it
tasted
light
a
really
floral
quad
this
could
be
good
as
a
share
for
dessert
make
a
fruit
crumble
or
a
cheese
plate
i
wonder
if
the
b
lue
is
as
sweet
beer
is
light
in
body
and
sweet
throughout
mildly
dry
finish
but
overall
a
nice
beer
the
yeast
character
on
the
palate
is
strong
and
sweet
floral
with
nice
fruity
esters
id
have
this
again
i
quite
like
this
the
earthy
notes
really
complement
the
classic
pale
strong
ale
flavours
here
good
loved
this
nose
is
a
bit
weak
but
the
rest
of
this
just
shines
the
age
on
the
bottle
probably
helped
this
is
not
overly
boozy
or
hot
fruit
grain
and
alcohol
grab
a
bottle
odelicious
i
approve
wholeheartedly
in
reading
other
reviews
many
people
complain
of
a
bit
of
heat
and
off
flavors
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
one
is
fantastic
and
well
worth
sitting
on
o
great
flavors
and
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ales
i
have
had
o
a
light
sweet
beer
whose
flavour
belies
its
strength
elegant
noticeably
belgian
quite
recommended
but
it
doesnt
find
the
same
favour
with
me
as
have
some
other
brouwerij
het
anker
beers
still
a
good
buy
would
have
again
o
nice
balaced
beer
with
subtleties
that
really
make
this
and
enjoyable
bspa
would
benefit
with
a
couple
of
years
ageing
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
o
this
is
the
first
beer
i
both
aged
and
reviewed
it
certainly
became
more
subdued
due
to
its
age
the
flavors
were
more
restrained
and
the
body
lighter
it
is
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
and
it
is
more
elegant
due
to
its
age
overall
very
enjoyable
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
a
result
of
the
aging
process
but
my
expectations
were
not
in
line
with
my
actual
experience
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
lighter
character
was
indicative
of
age
but
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
from
the
scent
than
what
i
got
in
the
taste
cheers
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
does
lack
some
of
the
complexity
you
might
expect
from
a
10
abv
brew
from
the
low
countries
but
i
really
like
the
base
flavors
here
ill
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
the
sweetness
dictates
that
this
beer
be
sipped
slowly
and
savored
not
one
id
drink
every
day
but
this
beer
is
unique
and
one
ill
come
back
to
again
overall
quite
nice
though
and
i
know
its
apples
and
oranges
i
definitely
prefer
the
keizer
blauw
though
its
almost
undrinkably
rich
whereas
this
is
pleasant
and
could
be
had
all
night
were
it
not
for
the
price
and
abv
this
could
go
well
with
steak
or
chicken
overall
i
expected
the
age
to
have
mellowed
this
beer
more
but
it
didnt
seem
to
help
tame
the
hops
and
alcohol
o
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
strong
but
drinkable
slightly
syrupy
but
not
tonguecoating
i
will
probably
buy
another
and
let
it
age
in
the
cellar
smell
is
good
bready
with
some
fuits
behind
it
good
taste
fresh
and
drinkable

vintage
poured
into
my
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
spongy
white
head
the
foam
just
sit
atop
the
brew
for
a
couple
minutes
without
going
down
at
all
the
nose
isnt
prominent
at
all
all
i
can
pick
up
is
some
muted
honey
cream
and
some
pale
malt
sweetness
with
perhaps
some
clove
the
flavor
is
light
and
sweet
it
tastes
of
honey
clove
pale
malts
with
a
light
trace
of
alcohol
im
surprised
at
how
subdued
the
alcohol
is
for
the
content
despite
the
short
list
of
adjectives
i
used
to
describe
the
flavors
its
actually
very
very
good
for
the
style
im
pretty
impressed
by
it
it
drinks
exceptionally
smooth
being
at
just
over
three
years
old
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
and
worth
trying
served
into
pilsner
glass
from
champagne
bottle
at
refrigerator
temperature
cork
was
extremely
hard
to
remove
pours
with
a
very
thick
creamy
head
which
dissipates
very
slowly
aroma
is
of
malt
and
honey
flavor
is
of
also
of
malt
and
honey
but
much
more
heavy
on
the
honey
sweetness
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
no
appreciable
alcohol
or
hop
flavor
this
could
certainly
benefit
from
another
10
15
ibu
of
bittering
to
balance
the
overwhelming
but
not
extremely
malty
sweetness
the
head
is
certainly
longlasting
especially
for
a
10
brew
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recomend
it
it
is
not
as
complex
as
many
other
belgians
that
i
have
had
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
that
hint
of
alcohol
that
one
expects
from
a
belgian
i
think
that
charles
v
would
have
been
happy
with
this
beer
im
going
to
get
another
bottle
and
cellar
this
ones
dated
2008
would
be
fun
to
see
how
it
ages
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
some
great
classic
flavors
all
around
with
a
nice
surprise
regarding
the
apple
flavor
id
recommend
this
to
anybody
thats
a
fan
of
the
style
2008
bottling
pours
gold
with
an
orange
tinge
and
a
lasting
fine
whitish
head
pears
and
pepper
on
the
nose
strong
but
not
a
complex
aroma
flavor
is
very
perfumey
but
not
in
an
alcoholic
way
very
vivid
peach
and
pear
notes
atop
a
caramel
malty
base
the
clarity
of
the
esters
is
unlike
anything
ive
tasted
in
beer
a
rather
nice
beer
d
really
good
brew
there
is
nothing
really
to
say
about
this
one
other
than
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
is
just
a
solid
brew
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
the
smell
and
taste
which
makes
this
beer
rather
drinkable
considering
its
strength
d
i
like
the
beer
its
interesting
strong
and
it
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
this
one
is
much
better
than
the
blue
label
and
is
quite
possibly
my
favorite
het
anker
brew
to
date
however
its
more
of
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
if
there
are
any
left
tight
carbonation
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
affecting
the
palate
in
a
negative
way
the
alcohol
presence
is
overpowering
and
dominates
throughout
into
a
very
hot
finish
there
is
some
peppery
zesty
spice
and
light
apple
and
pear
notes
but
again
they
are
completely
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
heat
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
blue
version
but
this
was
very
disappointing
this
one
needs
to
breathe
quite
a
bit
before
it
begins
to
unfold
its
complexity
still
a
fairly
solid
pale
and
fits
with
het
anker
a
very
strong
very
pale
and
very
good
belgian
ale
the
prominent
yet
in
the
end
balanced
sweetness
rendering
this
as
a
readily
enjoyable
sipper
though
the
masked
abv
will
eventually
make
me
pay
for
generally
ignoring
its
duly
specified
but
not
perceptible
at
the
given
time
potency
a
bloody
good
bspa
but
alas
poor
rood
i
still
prefer
the
blauw

shared
some
of
the
bottle
and
still
i
could
not
finish
more
then
about
12oz

am

1012

visitor
to
mechelen
and
het
anker
previous
memories
of
earlier
cuvee
reds
are
about
the
same
overall
a
difficult
one
to
describe
it
doesnt
wow
at
first
but
the
more
i
get
to
know
it
the
more
i
like
it
jd
similar
to
delirium
tremens
piraat
and
lucifer
the
beer
seems
agressive
and
over
bearing
where
big
sweetness
needs
big
spice
to
balance
i
feel
that
theres
too
much
conflict
and
not
enough
roundness
to
the
balance
to
be
more
pleasurable
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
extremely
boozy
once
i
got
past
the
alcohol
i
got
some
flowers
and
spices
the
flavor
is
alcohol
wheat
spices
and
flowers
the
alcohol
is
very
hot
and
makes
the
beer
tough
to
drink
as
it
warms
the
other
flavors
come
out
a
little
more
but
the
alcohol
is
always
very
present
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nice
beer
but
the
alcohol
could
be
hidden
better
d
despite
a
rather
pleasant
malt
and
sugar
base
this
beer
is
somewhat
ruined
by
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
appearance
has
a
slightly
off
pale
yellowish
golden
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
alcohol
heavy
almost
like
rubbing
alcohol
with
some
fruity
esters
candi
sugars
sweet
spices
and
belgian
yeast
medium
full
body
with
strong
active
carbonation
very
effervescent
but
finish
has
a
strong
alcohol
presence
detracting
from
the
overall
perception
of
the
body
and
flavor
flavor
is
super
sweet
tons
of
candi
sugar
ripe
sweet
fruit
and
yeast
very
uniquely
flavored
not
particularly
dry
crisp
or
earthy
but
the
extreme
booziness
and
sweetness
makes
this
a
challenge
to
consume

poured
into
a

have
been
looking

any
more
the
beer
pours
a

golden
color
a
little
tint
of
yellow
in
the
head
no

in

the
alcohol
was
super
strong
in
the
taste
at
10
it
tasted
way
over
that
i
decided
to
let
it
rest
in
the
glass
for
a
minute
or
two
i
wanted
to
see
if
it
would
soften
up
a
bit
it
did
a
little
i
started
to
pull
out
some
of
the
flavors
lemon
zest
and
some
floral
characteristics
came
to
mind
i
did
finish
it
but
i
was
not
overly
empressed
notes
vintage
2008
a
bit
surprised
by
the
amount
of
alcohol
flavor
is
still
present
after
2
years
its
not
necessarily
hot
or
really
offputting
but
it
is
a
little
higher
than
id
like
fairly
typical
bspa
flavors
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
but
it
is
a
solid
offering
definitely
worth
a
try
but
there
are
some
better
bspa
what
an
amazing
beer
it
pours
a
great
pure
golden
color
with
a
pure
white
foamy
head
that
explodes
once
it
hits
your
glass
the
nose
on
this
was
absolutley
fantastic
i
could
hardly
stop
smelling
this
long
enough
to
take
a
sip
you
pick
some
great
spice
notes
on
the
nose
along
with
a
sense
of
tropical
fruit
the
palate
fantastic
with
flavors
of
orange
zest
and
baking
spices
that
are
immediatley
noticable
with
some
notes
of
caramel
anise
and
corriander
coming
through
in
the
midpalate
the
mouthfeel
is
seemingly
light
at
first
but
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
simply
misleading
giving
off
an
airy
feeling
that
makes
it
seem
much
lighter
than
it
actually
is
its
rather
thick
and
settles
heavily
in
the
stomach
which
doesnt
help
its
case
for
drinkability
a
whole
lot
either
aftertaste
orange
alcohol
and
carbonation
are
almost
modest
for
the

well
hidden
and
each
sip
is
a
refreshing
invitation
to
drink
more
goes
down
far
too
easy
for
a
beer
this
big
i
really
like
this
very
drinkable
bubbles
make
you
want
to
drink
more
taste
stunning
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
tasted
floral
hops
great
citrus
notes
but
what
really
hit
me
are
the
tropical
fruits
and
fine
herbs
i
am
a
belgian
freak
and
this
one
has
recently
joined
my
favorites
d
a
little
sweet
not
as
digestive
as
some
belgians
but
a
good
drinker
served
in
a
snifter
this
thing
pours
a
nice
light
color
with
a
thin
head
to
be
honest
my
memory
of
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
overpowered
by
the
fine
licorice
fennel
taste
that
comes
on
during
the
finish
indeed
fennel
is
all
i
could
think
about
by
the
end
of
the
beer
loved
it
impression
couldnt
resist
trying
last
years
before
this
years
but
now
i
may
not
taste
this
years
and
just
put
it
away
with
a
year
this
beer
is
astoundingly
tasty
if
you
like
this
style
this
beer
is
a
must
try
a
very
tasty
brew
that
does
not
disappoint
but
might
stand
with
a
little
more
aging
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
if
you
have
had
duval
or
delirium
or
la
chouffe
you
have
had
this
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
belgiany
i
e
fruity
and
spicy
it
does
the
job
well
the
fact
that
cuvee
van
de
keizer
rood
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
speaks
as
much
to
my
love
affair
with
brouwerij
het
anker
as
it
does
to
this
beer
something
is
off
here
and
i
hope
the
brewery
makes
a
few
changes
if
they
decide
to
release
this
ale
again
my
expectations
where
met
with
an
above
average
brew
carolus
van
de
keizer
rood
is
a
strong
bspa
from
brouwerij
het
anker
its
not
quite
the
masterpiece
that
cuvée
van
de
keizer
is
but
not
many
beers
reach
that
level
the
only
thing
really
holding
this
one
back
is
the
alcohol
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
better
at
8
as
it
is
its
really
warm
and
the
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
other
than
that
its
a
solid
bspa
not
good
enough
to
compete
with
the
likes
of
duvel
but
very
good
easily
recommended
if
you
have
the
opportunity
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
faint
lemon
and
mild
belgian
yeast
with
powdered
sugar
and
honey
and
a
bit
of
coriander
it
tasted
like
candied
lemons
and
oranges
and
honey
with
coriander
and
sourdough
yeast
and
confectioners
sugar
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
light
belgians
ive
ever
had
it
was
very
delicate
and
clean
but
still
flavorful
and
delicious
it
had
a
very
refined
body
with
the
natural
carbonation
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
amazingly
well
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
often
and
highly
recommend
it
i
need
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
since
my
sample
was
over
a
year
old
and
id
also
be
curious
to
try
one
with
several
years
on
it
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
one
of
only
a
few
light
belgian
ales
that
could
improve
after
multiple
years
of
age
great
stuff
this
beer
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
there
is
some
spice
along
with
some
tart
fruit
and
a
bit
of
underlying
sweetness
it
almost
has
a
skunkiness
to
it
i
dont
believe
it
is
really
skunked
i
just
think
the
combination
of
the
tartness
and
spice
combine
for
that
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
finish
is
dry
i
wont
try
this
again
drinkability
do
i
want
another
not
now
hell
no
this
is
a
10
750
on
another
day
hell
yes
this
is
an
awesome
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
could
pop
for
a
special
occasion
and
get
all
sorts
of
nonbeer
drinkers
to
enjoy
it
d
a
delight
to
have
i
could
cradle
of
bottle
of
this
all
night
and
come
back
to
it
the
next
morning
d
goes
down
surprisingly
easy
dispite
it
being
a
10
beast
750ml
is
the
perfect
nightcap
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again

ale
from
the
fellows
at

they
know
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
making
great
belgian
beer
drinkability
is
solid
alcohol
is
evident
but
dangerously
shadowed
by
the
rest
of
the
beers
characteristics
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
and
one
that
i
may
have
to
revisit
especially
at
8
99
in
the
state
of
ohio
at
16
95
you
could
argue
that
the
price
is
steep
but
id
point
out
that
this
is
the
equivalent
of
three
pints
of
regular
beer
and
damn
good
ones
at
that
goulden
carolus
have
an
excellent
line
of
beers
and
this
one
even
if
it
is
just
the
easter
rebranded
will
only
add
to
their
reputation
this
beer

a
huge
three
inches
in
height
and
doesnt
recede
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
leather
fresh
cut
grass
and
a
general
yeastiness
the
taste
leans
more
toward
the
leathery
yeasty
side
than
the
aroma
does
the
orange
and
lemon
peel
are
there
but
they
are
tucked
into
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
i
know
the
some
might
find
this
beer
off
putting
because
of
the
malt
sweetness
but
the
complexity
keeps
me
coming
back
once
again
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
from
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brewers
highly
recommended
will
get
some
more
soon
drinkability
very
good
allaround
strong
belgian
blond
notes
malty
rich
fruity
sweet
and
explosively
spicy
this
bspa
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
the
second
brew
from
het
anker
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
and
while
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
van
de
keizer
blauw
it
is
still
a
pretty
damn
good
brew
recommended
poured
hazy
gold
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
exploded
out
of
my
old
guardian
tulip
glass
thick
white
lacing
tart
applesandspice
nose
with
some
yeast
esters
and
a
slight
musty
hay
aroma
crisp
effervescent
mouthfeel
that
battles
the
stickiness
in
the
finish
sweet
taste
that
was
expected
from
the
style
more
pear
and
apples
blended
with
spice
and
candied
sugar
a
funky
yeast
flavor
follows
along
with
a
boozy
finish
the
10
isnt
wellmasked
but
it
doesnt
take
over
the
beer
either
i
enjoyed
it
overall
an
very
good
bspa
that
i
really
enjoyed
highly
recommend
as
its
a
great
example
for
the
style
id
have
another
if
i
could
easily
get
it
but
since
not
avail
here
this
will
probably
be
my
only
one
d
wow
what
a
great
beer
this
was
right
in
my
palates
comfort
zone
and
i
am
wondering
why
i
havent
pulled
the
trigger
on
this
one
before
now
highly
recommended
bottle
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
ale
with
a
nice
big
pure
white
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
apricot
and
peach
ester
is
just
incredible
and
must
admit
that
not
many
brewery
can
get
this
much
from
their
yeast
taste
is
very
smooth
with
no
signs
of
alcohol
and
fruity
esters
are
very
well
balanced
with
some
sweet
belgian
malt
light
floral
hops
are
also
noticeable
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
discernable
another
winner
from
a
top
belgian
brewery
that
i
have
some
a
tendency
to
forget
about
drinkability
very
flavorful
beer
that
is
a
slow
sipper
based
on
the
alcohol
level
this
isnt
the
biggest
or
most
complex
belgian
pale
but
its
extremely
drinkable
recommended
yeasty
nose
is
slightly
offputting
but
the
initial
sweetness
with
apricots
pears
and
clove
is
very
nice
boozy
with
a
hot
alcohol
finish
that
is
nice
in
that
it
is
dry
but
does
not
balance
as
well
as
it
should
nice
carbonation
i
dont
get
the
sicksweetness
that
some
others
have
alluded
to
i
think
there
is
enough
spiciness
here
to
firm
it
up
a
bit
so
that
it
is
more
refreshing
than
syrupy
overall
not
a
classic
but
very
good
i
will
try
and
buy
another
couple
of
these
just
to
stick
in
the
basement
and
forget
about
i
would
worry
about
the
carbonation
it
was
already
creeping
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
cork
tastemfdrinkability
clean
with
a
light
belgian
yeast
derived
spice
character
a
touch
of
hops
but
scrubbed
very
quickly
by
the
big
carbonation
slight
alcohol
warming
but
extremely
palatable
and
quaffable
for
the
overall
strength
deceptive
like
a
fine
belgian
strong
pale
should
be
overall
this
is
a
nice
complement
if
not
antithesis
of
the
gouden
carolus
cuvee
van
de
keizer
blauwbleu
great
for
sipping
and
very
fullbodied
overall
d
woo
this
is
a
strong
one
just
one
bottle
please
but
this
bottle
can
last
half
the
night
if
sipped
on
properly
a
great
strong
ale

poured
a

formed
a

with

too
much

in

taste
d
nearcloying
sweetness
and
alcohol
limit
this
a
little
more
than
my
other
fave
bspas
but
still
relatively
tasty
after
letting
this
beer
sit
an
hour
the
flavors
came
together
a
little
better
opened
this
for
holloween
last
night
left
about
8oz
in
bottle
overnight
then
drank
in
the
morning
and
it
was
much
more
drinkable
tasting
a
liitle
like
a
blonde
chimay
my
advise
would
be
to
let
this
breath
for
a
couple
hours
then
drink
or
better
yet
put
this
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
years
then
enjoy
not
ready
now
drinkability
its
certainly
not
subtle
as
theres
tons
going
on
here
a
bit
alcoholic
initially
but
once
it
starts
coursing
through
your
system
you
learn
to
live
with
it
even
enjoy
it
and
focus
on
the
expressive
fruit
character
and
punchy
phenols
still
though
id
stick
with
the
blue
babies
d
this
one
is
a
very
good
drinker
even
with
the
high
and
noticeable
abv
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
an
immense
white
rocky
head
that
goes
nowhere
great
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
of
honey
candy
sugar
belgian
yeast
spices
pear
very
pleasant
smells
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
initial
sip
while
still
very
cold
was
extremely
biting
with
alcohol
bitter
extremely
phenolic
as
it
warmed
up
more
flavors
came
through
like
doughy
malts
the
yeast
some
honey
hops
but
the
alcohol
presence
was
still
very
much
there
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
extremely
carbonated
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
drinkability
factor
definitely
lacks
its
a
dark
golden
colored
beer
with
a
fully
lasting
head
purely
belgian
it
laces
well
on
the
glass
nose
of
dough
and
cookie
bready
malts
polish
and
fruit
smells
belgian
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
refinement
flavor
has
a
bit
too
much
strength
and
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
delicacy
or
complexity
sweet
it
possesses
heavy
notes
of
light
fruits
and
alcohol
this
belgian
misses
the
mark
this
might
get
slightly
higher
scores
in
a
couple
months
it
still
seems
a
tad
on
the
hot
side
hopefully
that
doesnt
correspond
to
a
more
subdued
aroma
but
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
is
superb
and

however

the

between

concentrated
up

and
then
dispersed
throughout

with
a
booziness

drinkability
is
impacted
by
the
overrepresentation
of

imposed
on
the
senses
oelergud
d
complex
and
tasty
a
little
sweet
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
with
a
little
age
on
it
d
for
a
10
brew
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
750ml
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
golden
yellow
hazy
body
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
fruity
and
spicy
tastes
citrussy
orangegrapefruit
with
spice
coriander
clove
and
the
slightest
hint
of
caramel
malt
toward
the
finish
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
a
fairly
easy
drinker
considering
the
abv
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
ill
definitely
be
getting
this
again
i
tried
this
at
a
beer
tasting
at
a
local
store
and
had
to
buy
a
bottle
its
interesting
complex
and
full
of
character
it
is
also
quite
young
and
certainly
has
not
reached
its
full
potential
this
is
a
very
good
beer
now
but
in
a
couple
years
i
can
almost
guarantee
it
will
be
outstanding
i
am
definitely
going
to
have
to
buy
a
couple
bottles
to
put
down
i
suggest
anyone
who
comes
across
this
buy
at
least
two
bottles
drink
one
now
and
lay
the
other
down
for
a
year
or
more
highly
recommended
d
a
slow
sipper
with
a
big
abv
pleasant
to
nurse
over
an
evening
and
let
the
day
slip
away
one
to
try
again
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
quite
impressive
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
the
dive
bar
in
worcester
a
few
days
ago
i
was
dreaming
about
it
all
day
today
to
the
point
that
i
went
back
and
had
another
at
1730
today
opening
its
a
light
blonde
in
color
but
the
flavor
is
big
exactly
what
id
expect
from
a
carolus
big
blonde
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
bite
at
the
end
i
dont
think
the
10
really
comes
through
im
sipping
a
2005

right
now
just
to
pay

to
this

am
drinking

and
upon
popping
the
tab
faint
bitter

large
pitted

on

hazy
gold
under
a
very
pillowy

persists

leaves
thick
lace
all
the
way
down

with

balancing
a
line
between
peach
and
apricot
with
citrus
very
faint

orange

and
light
grains
in

and
traces
of

the
bitter
on
the
finish
suggests
earthy

rind
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
high
while
the
beer
is
very
creamy
the
canned
version
tastes
artificially
carbonated
opposed
the
the
natural
carbonation
in
the
bomber
bottles
and
the
dcanned

feels
a

i
enjoyed

it

similar

very
enjoyable
and
smooth
taste
without
being
as
bitter
as
the
name
might
suggest
that
being
said
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
spice
in
such
a
beer
3
75
so
what
if
its
not
duvel
cans
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
its
crispness
and
mildly
interesting
ending
i
think
it
has
a
bit
of
belgian
taste
to
it
without
being
too
funky
or
bananatasting
like
some
belgians
seem
to
me
definitely
something
to
sip
on
a
nice
springsummer
evening
overall
a
fairly
nice
and
easy
drinking
bpa
a
good
one
to
try
lucifer
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
belgian
strong
golden
or
pale
ale
it
pours
a
hazy
blonde
color
with
an
inch
of
patient
white
head
that
leaves
heavy
rings
as
it
drinks
a
nose
of
banana
much
like
a
hefeweizen
but
cleaner
than
that
without
the
spice
other
fruit
esters
are
present
as
well
and
there
is
a
light
floral
quality
the
flavor
is
very
similar
yeast
driven
on
tap
i
get
quite
a
bit
more
hop
than
i
do
from
the
can
which
may
be
slightly
dated
but
i
almost
prefer
the
mellow
hop
bitterness
to
a
more
robust
experience
the
carbonation
is
through
the
roof
on
this
which
gives
it
refreshment
value
and
also
makes
it
seem
much
lighter
than
its
8
abv
which
will
trick
you
into
an
early
and
heavy
buzz
if
you
arent
careful
love
the
cereal
grain
qualities
and
the
way
the
yeast
becomes
so
summery
as
it
finishes
under
appreciated
i
think
this
is
a
beer
of
very
high
quality
that
is
widely
available
a
great
illustration
of
this
often
butchered
style
a
true
belgian
classic
overall
a
very
sweet
effervescent
strong
ale
i
really
enjoyed
the
nice
oxidized
fruit
notes
and
the
pleasant
malty
finish
but
there
was
too
much
of
the
candibubblegum
sweetness
for
my
tastes
with
that
said
you
can
tell
its
of
a
higher
abv
but
you
certainly
cant
detect
any
notes
of
alcohol
due
in
large
part
to
the
sweetness
overall
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
knew
i
couldnt
go
wrong
with
a
name
like
lucifer
and
i
was
right
it
was
refreshing
clean
and
light
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
a
big
shout
out
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
yeast
some
mild
fruits
taste
is
fruity
spicy
malts
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
faithful
to
style
with
medium
complexity
and
a
bit
standard
but
easier
to
drink
than
average
and
it
grows
as
it
warms
up
plays
well
spicy
bad
cop
and
sweet
fruit
good
cop
o
a
decent
belgian
strong
with
spice
and
fruit
o
very
nice
i
have
never
actually
tried
this
before
although
it
is
readily
available
in
my
market
call
it
normalcy
i
would
definitely
pick
up
several
of
these
next
time
i
am
out
very
drinkable
and
honestly
i
am
not
sure
why
the
suggested
serving
temperature
is
so
low
i
am
having
it
around
70
and
its
just
beautiful
o
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
ale
there
are
certainly
better
examples
out
there
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
nonetheless
o
great
beer
i
liked
this
very
much
hoppy
and
mellow
o
definitely
a
killer
beer
puts
most
beers
including
belgians
to
their
knees
beautiful
aroma
of
everything
that
begians
stand
for
taste
is
huge
with
a
prodigious
amount
flavor
hops
sweet
banana
and
yeast
well
worth
the
dollar
to
buy
it
i
approve
this
message
o
pretty
standard
for
a
bspa
but
enjoyable
enough
to
get
high
marks
refreshing
a
nice
light
sipping
beer
but
this
is
no
duvel
carbonation
level
is
good
maybe
a
bit
to
thick
to
be
a
real
easy
drinker
just
a
very
faint
warmth
thought
this
was
very
nice
would
have
again
if
looking
for
a
strong
belgian
pale
overall
bspas
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
lucifer
is
a
really
solid
example
and
one
i
would
quite
like
to
have
again
notes
good
trippel
with
a
lot
going
on
however
not
as
good
from
the
bottle
as
i
recall
having
it
on
draft
which
was
amazing
an
easy
drinking
beer
by
no
means
the
best
or
worst
o
a
solid
beer
that
delivers
complexity
and
a
great
super
clean
spiced
profile
its
easy
drinking
for
an
8
beer
i
would
recommend
this
and
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
overall
defiantly
not
worth
6
dollars
a
can
but
totally
smooth
and
worth
checking
out
just
on
the
allure
of
the
name
a
very
balanced
belgium
pale
ale
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
but
too
similar
to
the
gouden
carolus
tripel
to
make
a
lasting
impression
that
being
said
i
would
buy
this
again
it
fits
the
style
and
borrows
most
of
goudens
signature
ingredients
the
crack
had
a
nice
snap
to
it
and
i
once
again
employed
the
inverted
glug
to
create
more
than
two
fingers
of
dense
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
fruity
aroma
it
smelled
like
somebody
was
chewing
an
entire
pack
of
juicyfruit
gum
color
was
a
slightlyhazy
sunshineyellow
i
leaned
in
for
a
better
sniff
and
caught
not
only
mixed
fruit
but
also
a
yeasty
mustiness
oh
my
mouthfeel
was
soft
caressing
on
the
tongue
with
a
very
fruity
flavor
in
the
mouth
delicate
bitterness
too
delicate
to
register
on
my
palate
apparently
but
i
am
not
usually
drinking
this
style
for
its
associated
ibus
finish
was
semidry
with
the
yeast
causing
a
dryness
in
my
throat
on
the
extreme
finish
this
is
most
impressive
in
a
can
and
while
i
would
not
want
a
whole
bunch
it
would
probably
play
pretty
big
among
both
initiates
and
those
in
the
know
if
if
i
brought
some
in
a
cooler
o
a
good
bspa
overall
its
nice
to
see
this
beer
in
cans
now
as
well
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
or
drinkability
of
its
fellow
demonthemed
bspa
duvel
but
is
still
enjoyable
serving
type
bottle
o
refreshing
and
flavorful
but
a
bit
too
sweet
o
a
good
tasting
beer
but
the
high
carbonation
somewhat
puts
me
off
o
it
was
surprisingly
good
it
is
a
little
mild
as
far
as
taste
goes
but
id
rather
have
that
than
a
lot
of
bad
taste
d
higher
than
average
abv
but
very
drinkable
i
recommend
pours
a
slightly
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
i
like
this
one
it
ads
a
distinct
belgian
taste
to
the
pbr
that
i
would
drink
everyday
not
watery
though
but
still
refreshing
the
lite
warmth
of
the
8
abv
cuddles
me
into
bed
and
sings
me
a
lullaby
seriously
will
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
fall
back
when
available
however
this
is
nothing
to
really
pursue
taste
is
dominated
by
the
strong
yeast
character
the
yeast
adds
a
strong
fruity
taste
caused
by
the
higher
alcohols
there
are
flavors
of
bananas
and
peaches
the
maltiness
is
low
and
most
probably
enriched
by
a
large
sugar
addition
which
makes
the
body
of
the
beer
low
and
increases
drinkability
for
an
8
abv
beer
this
beer
drinks
way
too
easy
a
classic
and
nice
example
of
the
style
in
my
book
at
the
same
level
as
a
duvel
o
good
drinkability
good
beer
overall
pretty
good
strong
pale
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
syrupy
and
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
pedestrian
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
the
tobu
department
store
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
poured
into
a
white
wine
glass
the
appearance
was
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
lacking
for
a
quality
belgian
beer
i
thought
but
i
found
traces
of
hops
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
the
taste
followed
that
and
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
not
to
find
too
much
laying
deeper
in
the
brew
overall
this
was
a
decent
belgian
strong
but
there
are
so
many
other
better
options
when
it
comes
to
this
esteemed
category
of
beer
pretty
dang
good
overall
very
easy
to
drink
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ale
with
a
nice
fruity
citrus
presence
that
along
with
a
good
mix
of
yeast
and
alcohol
helped
make
sure
that
no
one
flavor
was
so
overpowering
that
it
overshadowed
any
other
this
brew
was
very
tasty
and
rather
refreshing
for
a
beer
that
has
such
a
high
abv
have
a
thirsty
towel
handy
because
this
one
pops
and
fizzes
like
champagne
it
pours
a
pretty
slightly
hazy
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
strong
yeasty
aroma
has
hints
of
pear
and
butterscotch
flavor
has
a
nice
malty
core
with
subtle
fruity
and
butterscotch
notes
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
firm
but
not
fierce
alcohol
bite
texture
has
good
body
and
plenty
of
sassy
fizz
devilish
price
isnt
bad
as
kef
said
he
bought
the
750ml
bottle
for
7
99
price
point
8
99750ml
bottle
a
solid
strong
blonde
from
the
folks
that
brought
us
gouden
carolus
i
imagine
that
a
bottle
without
the
defects
would
rate
higher
though
it
has
a
lot
of
work
to
do
if
it
wants
to
meet
its
stablemates
at
least
the
label
is
really
cool
o
this
is
a
beer
that
you
want
to
use
a
tulip
glass
for
to
capture
its
massive
head
its
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
topped
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
very
yeasty
with
pineapple
lemon
tangerine
and
flower
petal
notes
throughout
flavor
is
a
pleasantly
sweet
and
subtle
bubblegum
or
candy
comes
to
mind
alcohol
presence
is
hidden
well
classic
belgian
pale
good
but
not
on
the
level
of
many
others
that
are
readily
available
en
general
una
buena
belgian
strong
ale
overall
a
light
clean
drinkable
belgian
pale
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
good
taste
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
o
pretty
good
this
disappeared
rather
quickly
i
appreciate
any
belgian
i
can
quaff
some
of
the
flavors
do
seem
a
bit
artificial
for
a
true
belgian
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
raw
flavors
too
its
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
riva
to
het
hanker
maybe
actually
there
is
a
slight
jump
in
quality
i
did
like
the
preceding
lucifer
but
his
one
is
a
touch
lighter
and
maybe
a
bit
more
lemony
which
sorta
feels
better
on
this
occasion
for
my
palate
now
under
the
offer
that
finally
made
me
give
it
a
go
in
this
new
inaction
this
one
is
well
worth
picking
up
and
sharing
socially
but
the
regular
overblown
pricing
i
see
for
this
one
in
some
establishment
of
the
area
is
way
off
and
makes
one
wonder
if
they
simply
play
with
the
novelty
that
it
may
be
for
some
to
get
a
brew
with
this
branding
stay
away
from
this
not
horrible
just
not
good
bland
boring
and
disappointing
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
batch
im
not
spending
anymore
time
on
this
although
a
solid
beer
this
came
across
as
a
tripel
that
was
lacking
in
some
way
ive
had
st
feuillien
triple
that
served
up
a
better
banana
and
citrus
ester
flavoraroma
piraat
loves
the
alcohol
burn
st
bernardus
is
the
uber
balanced
tripel
this
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
i
love
the
mouthfeel
though
i
guess
im
a
little
torn
but
ultimately
this
is
a
beer
that
is
lacking
in
some
way
compared
to
other
awesome
belgians
good
but
not
to
die
for
o
its
a
good
brew
for
sitting
around
drinking
this
really
strikes
me
as
a
more
craft
like
blue
moon
its
stronger
for
sure
but
the
taste
is
there
im
not
knocking
it
as
i
think
this
is
something
my
wife
would
like
and
be
okay
with
id
rather
have
a
darker
ale
if
i
were
going
to
pick
something
though
poured
a
very
cloudy
straw
gold
with
quick
dying
two
finger
head
that
left
minimal
lace
patches
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
mixed
some
sour
funkiness
and
yeast
along
with
citric
notes
lemon
orange
peel
and
spices
like
clove
and
pepper
a
light
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
yet
retains
a
crispness
thanks
to
lively
carbonation
and
some
spicy
notes
on
the
backend
some
sugary
goodness
balances
out
citric
tartness
so
the
beer
is
neither
too
tart
or
sweet
also
picked
up
touches
of
other
light
fruit
like
pear
or
white
grape
skin
that
give
off
a
sweet
fruit
taste
and
a
sour
note
or
two
as
well
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
ale
and
im
glad
its
back
o
this
is
a
very
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
do
not
expect
it
to
bring
anything
new
or
exciting
to
the
table
pours
strawyellow
in
color
hazy
almost
creamy
in
appearance
forms
a
crafted
tightly
bubbled
head
notes
of
freshly
baked
bread
lemon
and
ripe
banana
float
from
the
glass
the
tastes
follow
suit
as
a
combination
of
pastries
and
lemon
pepper
coats
the
palate
chewy
but
carbonated
the
brew
delivers
a
satisfying
complexion
without
weighing
down
the
palate
eminently
drinkable
could
work
as
a
session
brew
if
it
wasnt
for
the
sneaky
8
abv
o
not
the
best
bspa
ive
had
but
its
nice
nonetheless
i
really
enjoyed
this
in
the
future
i
might
seek
others
first
but
i
will
revisit
another
solid
beer
from
het
anker
very
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
isnt
too
apparent
and
great
mix
of
malts
and
hops
overall
a
very
refreshing
golden
ale
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
two
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
pale
malt
hint
of
citrus
hops
hint
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
dough
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
citrus
hops
slight
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
good
blend
appearance
aroma
and
body
pours
midpale
gold
with
a
tight
quick
head
a
little
sharp
up
front
and
the
flavor
profile
is
solidly
in
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
tradition
alcohol
is
a
bit
prominent
seeming
even
bigger
than
the
8
listed
here
teetered
on
the
edge
of
harsh
but
managed
to
pull
back
enough
to
be
drinkable
still
just
a
touch
hot
though
m
sweetness
and
bitterness
are
well
balanced
the
ending
is
good
a
little
dry
but
with
good
lasting
mostly
bitter
and
complex
o
a
nice
beer
tastes
good
will
drink
again
recommend
o
i
was
apprehensive
as
a
lover
of
gouden
carolus
that
this
beer
would
let
me
down
but
i
am
not
disappointed
a
superlative
belgian
strong
pale
ale
one
of
the
finest
and
highly
recommended
will
drink
again
this
beer
poured
out
surprisingly
clear
looking
i
thought
for
sure
there
would
be
some
haze
to
this
one
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
bright
yellow
the
head
was
big
and
fluffy
white
the
lacing
was
scattered
and
soapy
looking
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
nice
floral
quality
to
it
along
with
some
belgian
yeast
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavors
of
some
light
hops
and
floral
spice
come
in
strong
here
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
bubbly
overall
i
like
this
beer
found
it
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
predictable
based
on
the
smell
i
note
some
additional
alcohol
warmth
the
body
is
rich
even
if
the
beer
is
relatively
dry
quite
carbonated
o
nice
example
of
the
stye
but
you
can
find
better
still
worth
checking
out
if
you
havent
had
it
before
this
brew
pours
clean
and
golden
yellow
hints
of
fruit
with
a
dry
bitter
taste
that
is
clean
and
long
lasting
not
harsh
this
brew
has
an
8
abv
that
drinks
like
a
5
very
deceiving
brew
from
the
abv
stand
point
i
enjoyed
it
most
definitely
will
grab
another
when
the
chance
presents
itself
d
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
to
enjoy
d
very
good
beer
abv
is
deceptively
high
easy
drinking
4
overall
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
for
hookah
smoking
very
interesting
in
taste
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
like
to
have
another
one
quite
nice

but
a
solid
gateway
belgian
for
someone
more
used
to
american
beers
recommended
if
available
the
finish
is
smooth
and
again
lightly
effervescent
it
leaves
a
clean
sweetness
on
my
tongue

totally
quenched
my
cheeks

verdict
short
of
world
class
but
good
beer
a
tad
too
alcohol
tasting
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
but
worth
trying
the
flavor
is
as
the
nose
suggests
and
to
be
honest
id
swear
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
more
on
the
aggressive
side
before
alas
this
is
fairly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
the
alcohol
never
shows
its
delicately
fruity
apples
pear
and
sweetish
without
becoming
candyish
honeyish
or
cloying
theres
some
malty
graininess
to
it
and
theres
just
enough
hop
character
and
yeasty
spice
threaded
through
to
give
it
some
guts
its
well
rounded
well
balanced
and
clean
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
pours
clear
gold
with
a
xxl
head
no
cloudiness
if
you
pull
back
on
the
pour
smells
yeasty
and
musty
with
some
malt
aroma
flavor
is
very
nice
full
bitter
with
no
piney
bite
and
a
slight
sweetness
that
is
barely
noticeable
very
carbonated
feel
but
remarkably
quick
to
drink
not
as
impressive
as
its
devil
brother
duvel
doovel
but
similar
in
its
strength
and
flavor
in
many
ways
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
the
try
this
beer
is
phenomenalmy
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohols
stick
out
in
the
flavor
a
bit
especially
as
it
warms
that
said
it
is
so
dry
and
crisp
you
could
certainly
drink
a
ton
of
thisat
least
enough
of
this
to
knock
you
on
your
ass
not
super
impressive
but
still
good
nonetheless
el
alcohol
se
siente
de
inmediato
combinando
el
sabor
cítrico
ligero
y
dando
un
muy
firme
sabor
i
picked
this
up
at
my
local
total
wine
with
an
abv
of
8
and
having
such
an
evil
name
i
thought
i
was
in
for
something
amazing
good
is
more
how
i
would
describe
it
very
weak
for
a
belgian
with
minimal
aroma
average
yellow
color
minimal
head
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
a
strong
aftertaste
that
most
strong
belgians
have
seven
and
a
half
years
ago
a
beer
under
this
name
got
a
thumbs
down
from
me
as
produced
by
riva
since
het
anker
has
been
brewing
it
i
cant
find
a
flaw
though
i
dont
normally
prefer
blondes
this
is
one
ill
reach
for
now
and
then
this
beer
is
a
nice
strong
belgian
pale
ale
and
like
most
beers
in
this
style
is
very
easy
to
drink
drinkable
enough
but
not
terribly
exciting
especially
for
the
style
not
a
huge
belgian
brew
but
quite
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
a
perfectly
serviceable
belgian
pa
it
has
the
color
of
a
tripel
which
ive
always
found
to
be
unappealing
with
a
thin
but
attractive
white
head
enough
yeast
in
the
aroma
to
remind
you
that
its
a
belgian
beer
the
taste
was
somewhat
light
and
sugary
with
a
touch
of
fruity
koolaid
up
front
and
zero
bitterness
at
the
back
end
it
gained
some
density
as
it
warmed
still
it
was
lacking
character
worth
a
glass
but
nothing
more
d
not
quite
interesting
enough
to
be
a
frequent
drinker
but
would
not
pass
it
up
if
offered
again
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
it
drinks
like
a
big
lower
alcohol
brew
by
which
i
mean
at
8
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
a
mellow
yet
tasty
belgian
strong
pale
ale
fairly
fruity
and
hard
to
believe
it
is
really
8
abv
nothing
too
special
but
nice
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
d
pretty
good
drinkability
i
had
no
problem
putting
the
750
away
by
myself
it
is
a
bit
heaving
and
filling
probably
best
with
a
friend
d
clean
fizzy
and
refreshing
very
good
and
worthy
of
another
glass
or
two
jd
lucifer
seems
to
be
an
overly
aggressive
and
illbalanced
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
comming
together
to
do
overall
a
deceptive
and
easy
drinking
ale
with
more
of
a
hop
display
than
i
had
expected
very
good
however
not
world
class
such
as
its
counterpart
duvel
the
server
at
a
local
pub
said
lucifer
had
just
been
tapped
and
recommended
that
i
give
it
a
try
the
ale
was
served
in
a
neat
looking
squatty
stem
class
it
was
a
golden
yellow
cloudy
with
over
an
inch
of
foam
on
the
top
and
a
nice
bit
of
effervescence
the
smell
was
fruity
a
characteristic
banana
yeast
aroma
with
no
obvious
hint
of
hops
it
had
a
big
banana
flavor
not
surprising
for
this
style
with
a
light
note
of
hop
spice
in
the
background
very
much
a
malt
taste
dry
finish
so
enjoyable
drinkability
quite
nice
pours
a
perfect
beautiful
slightly
hazy
peach
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
slowly
recedes
smell
is
great
also
it
starts
with
belgian
yeast
then
applespears
and
bananas
a
little
clove
and
some
sweet
bread
in
the
background
mmm
taste
is
superb
its
crisp
and
pure
with
belgian
yeast
lots
of
fresh
fruits
a
little
pepper
some
clove
and
sweet
baked
bread
it
is
perfectly
balanced
a
treat
mouth
feel
is
super
fresh
not
overpowering
just
full
of
belgian
goodness
imo
this
is
a
superb
bspa
that
drinks
like
a
golden
you
dont
notice
the
8
abv
try
this
one
drinkability
a
very
nice
example
of
the
belgian
blonde
style
with
a
lightness
of
touch
but
plenty
of
flavor
carbonation
eh
when
i
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
taking
notes
i
made
a
conscious
note
to
myself
dont
compare
this
beer
to
duvel
just
take
it
as
its
own
thing
it
turns
out
that
comparing
this
atrocity
to
duvel
is
laughable
maybe
it
needs
to
be
bottleconditioned
to
be
good
overall
a
very
solid
and
very
well
rounded
pale
i
had
no
problems
putting
this
one
down
and
could
see
it
being
a
nice
intro
into
the
bigger
styles
really
a
solid
offering
here
for
sure
d
there
is
some
trace
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
here
but
it
was
not
distracting
or
overpowering
at
all
i
think
the
fact
that
the
flavor
was
so
mellow
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
beer
i
finished
a
750ml
bottle
myself
over
the
course
of
an
evening
of
cooking
refreshing
and
worth
trying
hazy
orange
body
two
fingers
white
head
medium
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
the
nose
was
orange
peel
cardamon
muted
pepper
presence
and
noticeable
belgian
yeast
in
the
finish
taste
is
more
grainy
than
citrusy
pepper
doesnt
become
prevalent
until
the
beer
is
fully
warmed
dry
finish
medium
dry
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
so
a
bit
sticky
not
too
much
of
a
abv
hit
to
effect
drinkability
but
it
really
didnt
taste
all
that
great
this
aint
duvel
it
was
light
and
actually
pretty
refreshing
as
in
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
it
was
a
little
average
in
this
respect
too
d
pretty
drinkable
but
you
couldnt
pound
this
one
all
night
the
drinkability
is
detracted
from
a
slight
bit
from
the
strong
alcohol
presence
in
the
nose
and
throat
but
otherwise
is
pretty
easy
to
go
down
because
of
the
light
body
pilsner
malt
and
dry
finish
hmm
interesting
beer
also
had
this
ontap
at
the
black
squirrel
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
appearace
was
average
smell
was
fresh
and
light
taste
was
very
yeasty
i
couldnt
tell
what
it
was
at
first
it
was
kind
of
an
off
flavor
i
also
tasted
a
lot
of
sugar
and
bananas
the
beer
was
good
but
very
thin
if
that
makes
any
sense
i
kept
waiting
for
more
but
it
just
didnt
deliver
there
are
so
many
other
beers
in
this
style
that
are
available
so
i
wouldnt
waste
your
time
with
this
one
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
very
thick
fluffy
head
and
fair
lace
smell
of
light
belgian
yeast
spice
and
some
fruits
taste
of
the
sour
yeast
light
sweet
malts
with
some
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
crisp
light
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
great
it
just
lacks
what
i
expected
out
of
a
this
belgian
ale
as
i
was
drinking
this
i
found
myself
saying
man
this
is
better
than
duvel
but
i
almost
didnt
want
to
believe
what
i
was
thinking
i
happened
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
duvel
in
the
cellar
so
i
cracked
one
for
a
side
by
side
duvel
smells
a
bit
sweeter
while
lucifer
has
a
bigger
grassy
hop
nose
and
is
a
bit
more
floral
i
think
taste
wise
duvel
is
again
a
bit
sweeter
while
the
grassy
and
spicy
characters
of
lucifer
jump
out
more
i
stand
by
my
original
assessment
this
is
better
than
duvel
it
even
keeps
more
stick
than
duvel
i
never
had
the
old
version
of
lucifer
brewed
by
riva
and
there
are
very
few
reviews
of
this
new
one
so
far
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
absolutely
exceptional
beer
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
d
overall
this
is
a
good
devil
beer
with
a
good
taste
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
however
i
would
choose
duvel
over
this
one
but
its
still
worth
a
try
at
least
once
d
overall
it
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
that
feels
relatively
light
considering
it
is
8
abv
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
now
and
it
is
something
i
would
continue
to
buy
when
looking
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
drinkability
tasty
enough
with
the
good
mouthfeel
its
incredibly
drinkable
the
abv
is
undetectable
d
a
good
beer
but
not
great
really
lacks
the
complexity
and
the
wow
factor
i
was
expecting
mostly
just
sweet
and
boozy
i
feel
it
needs
a
bit
more
spice
or
other
flavors
a
sipper
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
given
the
flavor
experience
biting
and
lingering
solid
ass
brew
very
well
thought
out
and
well
placed
flavors
my
only
draw
back
was
the
cold
harsh
carbonation
everything
else
rocked
highly
recommended
overall
why
did
they
take
away
the
six
packs
again
seriously
this
stuffs
really
good
worth
getting
the
brewers
picks
to
try
it
if
you
havent
recommend
if
you
like
their
collette
and
orabelle
i
really
liked
this
had
it
out
of
the
brewers
variety
pack
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
color
is
a
lighter
gold
with
just
a
slight
touch
of
haze
not
a
lot
of
head
super
light
flavor
with
some
nice
clove
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
mild
really
worth
a
go
on
a
summer
daynight
flavors
of
a
very
dry
cream
soda
with
herbs
some
malt
sweetness
but
also
funky
yeast
esters
going
all
over
including
bitter
citrus
light
aspirin
cream
of
tartar
white
pepper
overall
very
big
and
bold
body
with
some
bite
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
for
the
price
i
will
be
trying
more
of
the
great
divide
brews
because
of
this
great
first
impression
overall
one
of
the
better
americanmade
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
you
can
sense
the
tribute
to
duvel
but
it
still
establishes
a
character
all
its
own
definitely
a
beer
i
would
drink
over
and
over
if
it
was
readily
available
o
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
another
great
beer
from
great
divide
d
nice
enjoyable
brew
o
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
pronounced
spice
character
derived
mostly
from
the
yeast
with
the
hops
lending
a
hand
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
there
was
soft
sweetness
of
white
sugar
light
gingerbread
and
big
banana
and
bubblegum
esters
these
mixed
nicely
getting
you
interested
from
the
start
it
did
however
lose
points
on
the
excessive
bitterness
and
surprising
booziness
at
the
end
of
the
flavoring
each
sip
felt
nice
going
down
but
mouthfeel
was
otherwise
less
contributory
this
beer
is
decent
for
the
style
and
at
times
overly
robust
in
all
the
wrong
places
o
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
and
would
make
for
a
good
strong
pale
ale
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
if
you
want
something
with
a
little
more
strength
compared
to
a
saison
this
beer
pours
up
very
pale
straw
with
a
thin
head
not
much
retention
lots
of
delicate
lacing
and
a
generous
amount
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
constantly
rising
from
the
bottom
the
smell
is
honey
cinnamon
floral
malt
and
biscuit
taste
mainly
follows
the
nose
with
a
subtle
honey
flavor
up
front
followed
by
spicy
hops
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
tend
to
like
beer
a
bit
more
powerful
but
this
offering
is
quite
nice
even
if
it
is
a
milder
flavor
strange
that
a
beer
this
mild
would
be
called
hades
though
overall
a
really
good
take
on
this
belgian
style
good
use
of
belgian
yeast
and
spices
fruit
taste
is
solid
overall
this
is
good
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
strongertasting
belgians
on
the
market
the
sheer
volume
of
flavor
in
here
especially
present
in
the
variety
and
complexity
of
sugars
is
impressive
unfortunately
the
beer
gets
slightly
carried
away
with
these
notes
especially
as
they
combine
with
the
heavy
alcohol
burn
and
the
result
while
delicious
is
at
the
same
time
slightly
overwhelming
and
distracting
creating
a
sensation
of
vodkasoaked
fruit
cocktail
worth
trying
but
beware
the
burn
pours
very
pale
blonde
light
haze
a
little
under
a
finger
of
white
head
little
lace
as
well
smell
is
quite
malty
and
biscuity
initially
belgian
yeast
and
banana
follows
spicy
and
fruity
mostly
apple
quite
nice
and
better
as
this
neared
the
end
taste
is
spicy
with
clove
and
banana
yeasty
and
doughy
flavours
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
fruity
some
earthy
hop
flavours
and
a
dry
bitterness
overtop
of
a
light
sweetness
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
fairly
nice
feel
solid
belgian
pale
but
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
still
a
drinkable
brew
unique
taste
to
compared
to
others
of
this
style
stands
out
from
the
rest
and
is
worthy
of
taking
up
a
side
shelf
in
my
fridge
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
great
lightfeeling
fruity
saisonlike
brew
has
some
unique
elements
to
it
and
hides
its
strength
memorable
and
worthwhile
would
definitely
have
again
this
is
a
decent
belgian
ale
unfortunately
its
a
bit
onedimensional
and
boring
highly
drinkable
and
smooth
its
worth
a
try
for
me
though
ill
pass
in
the
future
ended
up
much
better
than
the
appearance
fairly
drinkable
but
not
something
id
want
to
have
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
this
style
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
three
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
spices
fruit
subtle
banana
and
floral
notes
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
spices
wheat
fruit
and
banana
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
surprisingly
this
one
was
rather
fruit
forward
upon
investigation
while
this
is
definitely
good
for
drinkability
it
does
wear
on
you
after
awhile
as
there
was
no
real
balance
in
it
to
counteract
this
i
would
have
loved
to
see
just
a
hint
of
citrus
or
bitterness
going
on
to
make
this
one
a
little
more
balanced
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
though
if
that
is
more
your
thing
worth
trying
if
see
it
sitting
around
on
the
shelves
ehh
nothing
to
great
about
this
beer
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
considering
great
divide
and
what
they
put
out
there
solid
american
influenced
belgian
not
overly
complex
but
theres
enough
in
there
to
keep
it
interesting
very
nice
belgian
light
pale
ale
not
terribly
complex
but
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
o
pretty
good
bspa
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
a
perfect
blend
of
belgium
yeast
with
bittering
hops
it
pours
super
clear
golden
color
a
bit
surprising
for
a
belgium
smell
crispbrightcitrusy
belgium
yeast
taste
is
well
balanced
of
pale
ale
meets
belgium
ale
if
you
like
pale
ale
youll
dig
this
its
a
good
break
from
straight
forward
pales
ales
if
you
like
belgium
ales
youll
dig
this
too
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
overly
bitter
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
you
can
barely
tell
its
a

abv
i
love
great
divide
beers
havent
had
a
bad
one
yet
nice
work
gd
a
nice
belgian
ale
light
and
flavorful
would
love
this
on
draught
all
the
flavors
you
want
from
a
big
strong
belgian
pale
ale
with
the
drinkability
of
a
smaller
belgian
pale
ale
amazing
overall
not
a
super
impressive
beer
good
belgian
qualities
but
there
are
better
on
the
market
very
drinkable
though
great
yeast
strain
o
ok
beer
middling
i
would
like
to
enjoy
more
bottles
of
this
in
the
summer
hades
was
a
light
feeling

which
does
a
good
job

abv
i
am
going
to
look
around
for
this
in
new
jersey
to
store
for
the
summer
great
divide
did
a
credible
job
with
hades
ale
its
pretty
good
stuff
it
does
have
a
few
blemishes
the
nose
could
use
more
strength
and
perhaps
the
strong
spiciness
could
be
toned
down
just
a
tad
its
pretty
enjoyable
overall
though
worth
checking
out
poured
from
bottle
to
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
bright
yellow
straw
color
with
a
minimal
head
not
much
retention
nor
lacing
average
looking
beer
very
little
carbonation
noticeable
the
nose
is
more
impressive
with
a
nice
blend
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
also
pleasant
a
mix
of
cereal
bread
malt
character
with
belgian
yeast
esters
and
earthy
hops
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
not
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
overall
a
lighter
take
on
a
belgian
strong
but
sill
good
first
foray
into
great
divides
catalog
recommend
that
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
with
a
wide
bowl
and
with
room
for
a
nice
foamy
head
bubbles
disappear
quickly
but
go
a
long
way
in
releasing
all
the
bouquet
and
flavors
smells
almost
like
a
white
wine
a
riesling
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
in
fact
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
nice
hoppiness
after
a
few
moments
nice
aftertaste
i
e
no
real
bitterness
very
very
nice
belgian
ale
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
biscuity
and
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
similar
and
very
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
good
i
guess
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
as
i
was
surprised
by
the
mediocre
ratings
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
will
have
again
in
the
future
good
stuff
had
this
one
a
long
time
ago
and
remember
being
indifferent
towards
it
but
recently
been
in
the
mood
to
revisit
it
pours
a
yellow
golden
color
looks
like
apple
juice
a
little
over
a
thumbs
width
white
head
the
yeast
is
the
first
thing
i
smell
and
it
hit
me
the
moment
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
as
it
settles
the
yeast
maintains
its
strength
alongside
some
breadiness
from
the
malt
the
funkiness
of
the
yeast
is
definitely
the
most
assertive
of
the
features
and
i
kinda
wish
they
dialed
it
down
just
a
tad
same
deal
with
the
flavor
the
yeast
is
what
hits
the
hardest
and
i
think
it
hit
me
way
too
hard
the
yeast
didnt
hide
the
rest
of
the
flavors
though
which
were
bready
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
peppery
and
fruity
finish
a
nice
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
dose
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
alive
in
your
mouth
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
more
this
time
around
than
the
first
time
but
not
as
much
as
id
hoped
to
if
they
could
tone
the
funk
down
i
think
this
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
for
me
i
drank
one
bottle
of
this
i
couldnt
drink
any
more
without
taking
a
break
good
basic
belgian
style
pale
ale
pours
a
plain
looking
light
adjunct
lager
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
smells
like
german
malts
and
belgian
yeast
in
your
face
and
strong
there
flavor
is
a
little
hoppy
with
a
nice
yeast
crispness
at
the
end
like
a
vienna
lager
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
too
light
for
me
but
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
nice
sturdy
abv
for
such
a
light
feeling
brew
dangerously
sessionable
going
to
be
good
with
some
spice
grilled
burgers
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
personally
seek
out
doa
overall
i
am
stunned
on
how
high
the
brothers
rate
this
since
it
seems
like
a
light
belgium
beer
sure
its
smooth
and
pale
but
nothing
seemed
to
stand
out
to
make
it
special
would
consider
getting
an
actual
belgium
pale
or
prankster
over
this
dr
drinkable
but
lackluster
wouldnt
get
it
again
1
00
for
a
sampler
is
a
fair
price
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
in
bottle
form
by
any
means
d
good
balance
of
hops
and
belgian
spiced
yeast
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
body
the
head
didnt
form
as
well
as
i
would
have
like
and
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
with
the
nice
nose
it
had
to
start
great
divide
hades
belgian
style
ale
here
is
a
unique
offering
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
leffe
goblet
glass
that
i
picked
up
in
europe
the
hades
has
the
look
of
an
aged
chardonnay
very
little
head
and
a
bright
straw
color
almost
no
carbonation
even
though
it
looks
more
like
wine
than
beer
the
aroma
is
100
belgian
ale
the
distinctive
yeast
aroma
is
abundant
and
that
belgian
yeast
bread
and
sweetness
come
through
in
the
flavor
but
not
in
an
overpowering
fashion
the
hades
is
light
compared
to
any
tripels
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
hoppy
finish
but
make
no
mistake
there
is
plenty
of
belgian
style
enjoyment
very
highly
recommended
for
a
lighter
twist
on
the
belgian
theme
o
a
nice
quencher
as
stated
earlier
i
like
a
dry
finish
in
these
types
of
ales
and
this
one
delivers
o
ive
never
had
a
beer
by
these
guys
thats
any
less
than
great
and
this
ones
no
exception
overall
a
better
drink
than
i
expected
abv
is
not
overly
present
and
flavors
work
together
nicely
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
this
beer
has
some
qualities
that
certain
beer
drinkers
would
shy
away
from
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
can
be
at
times
slighty
bitter
due
to
the
phenols
and
high
abv
yet
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
truly
outstanding
with
a
very
complex
yet
balanced
flavor
profile
that
starts
fruitysour
mellows
to
a
smooth
carmel
maltiness
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
bite
this
complex
flavor
profile
makes
the
beer
suprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
the
balance
makes
this
a
beer
that
doesnt
overpower
the
senses
in
any
one
category
like
some
strong
ales
tend
to
do
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
what
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
before
fading
away
its
a
belgian
style
with
some
light
malt
character
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
tastes
like
a
belgian
style
hops
give
it
a
slight
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
slight
grassy
taste
and
almost
wheat
character
its
not
really
my
type
of
beer
and
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
any
time
soon
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
did
come
off
as
slightly
boozy
along
with
being
on
the
richer
side
overall
drinkability
is
excellent
i
thought
the
hop
character
and
complexity
was
better
than
would
be
expected
overall
an
okay
ale
perhaps
a
bit
one
sided
with
the
soapy
hops
taking
complete
control
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
i
liked
the
milder
flavor
this
particular
belgian
yeast
imparted
sharply
carbonated
but
rightly
so
o
subpar
cant
imagine
that
ill
revisit
this
one
was
a
let
down
from
an
otherwise
good
brewery
this
belgianstyle
ale
sports
a
light
golden
color
and
moderate
carbonation
but
unfortunately
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
head
which
was
2
centimeters
thick
and
disappeared
as
quickly
as
the
marquis
de
lafayette
did
from
history
after
the
american
revolution
and
as
the
head
receded
it
left
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
hades
smells
strongly
of
yeast
which
is
far
more
pleasing
than
brimstone
yeast
dominates
the
flavor
of
the
beverage
as
well
along
with
distinct
biscuit
and
wheat
flavors
that
hide
the
alcohol
taste
and
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
relatively
sweet
spice
notes
its
also
a
little
more
fullbodied
than
its
appearance
would
suggest
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
buy
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
medium
bodied
bitter
beer
pours
a
virtually
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
leaves
a
decent
coating
of
head
made
of
miniscule
bubbles
that
slide
down
the
glass
quickly
and
cling
only
occasionally
smell
is
mostly
grainy
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
hop
presence
only
the
faintest
bit
of
yeast
taste
is
just
how
it
smells
but
with
a
bit
more
yeast
and
lagery
twinge
to
it
in
the
finish
super
light
in
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
its
yummy
but
nothin
to
write
home
about
getem
cheap
in
mix
packs
now
and
then
and
its
always
a
drinkable
option
alcohol
is
well
disguised
also
have
a
couple
sitting
in
the
cellar
why
not
clear
golden
yellow
body
disappointed
in
the
small
head
formation
and
retention
smell
isnt
overly
belgian
spicy
which
is
a
surprise
getting
just
faint
hints
of
banana
and
spice
in
fact
its
maltiness
reminds
me
of
a
maibock
nice
flavor
with
a
lot
of
yeast
fuitinessa
surprising
quality
finish
has
some
alcohol
heat
body
is
medium
in
weight
but
a
little
low
on
carbonation
i
want
this
to
be
sparkling
and
effervescent
like
duvel
is
doughy
slightly
sweet
malts
are
balanced
well
with
the
grassy
hops
it
really
does
tastefeel
lighter
than
its
abv
i
think
the
yeast
is
providing
the
overriding
character
to
this
beernot
a
bad
thing
its
quite
a
unique
ale
fruitiness
another
well
done
style
of
beer
to
round
out
great
divides
diverse
portfolio
i
didnt
expect
any
less
overall
great
session
beer
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
will
definately
try
again
overall
its
decent
not
much
to
get
excited
about
but
decent
o
by
far
this
is
the
best
nonbelgian
belgian
ive
had
as
i
said
above
this
one
even
outshines
some
of
the
true
belgians
ive
sampled
well
done
great
divide
with
an
experience
like
this
its
no
doubt
that
ill
probably
be
trouncing
through
their
lineup
in
the
near
future
next
stop
denver
again
this
beer
seems
better
to
be
had
straight
from
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
at
once
crisp
and
creamy
filling
the
nmouth
while
never
losing
its
nip
though
it
fades
when
its
been
sitting
a
bit
carbonation
is
active
and
the
body
is
medium
overall
lots
of
flavor
in
this
one
not
to
be
missed
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
watery
crisp
mouthfeel
floral
earthy
hops
provide
faint
bitterness
which
is
countered
by
some
light
fruit
zesty
spice
and
some
alcohol
sweetness
hints
of
pepper
and
coriander
followed
by
some
apple
pear
and
light
grapes
easy
to
dink
but
not
complex
or
very
interesting
the
aroma
was
light
pears
apples
hints
of
light
lemon
an
citrus
pops
in
it
nice
warming
brings
hints
of
the
yeast
and
nice
touches
of
the
bready
touches
of
light
well
balanced
flavor
hints
of
citrus
and
pears
nicely
balanced
against
light
bready
notes
hints
of
grain
and
a
nice
well
balanced
feel
very
very
drinkable
and
just
a
very
well
rounded
light
belgian
ale
summer
fruit
nose
with
smells
and
all
special
features
of
the
apple
and
pear
all
present
in
the
nose
but
not
acids
easy
to
drink
after
all
hop
light
enough
and
unfortunately
the
finish
a
bit
weak
of
course
ideal
for
summer
due
to
summer
fruit
flavors
and
complex
proposed
but
too
little
too
little
for
a
dark
beer
called
by
the
name
of
the
underground
god
not
a
real
belgianstyle
but
more
a
american
pale
ale
offers
a
decent
belgian
aroma
with
agitation
but
it
takes
too
much
work
to
get
there
overall
a
fail
thanks
for
trying
overall
a
decent
beer
have
had
better
in
this
category
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
golden
color
with
white
head
and
average
lacing
and
rentention
the
smells
were
of
light
malts
and
slightly
yeasty
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
just
great
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
in
recent
tasting
it
was
smooth
full
bodied
and
full
of
flavors
that
you
would
expect
in
a
belgian
style
beerl
very
happy
woth
this
choice
highly
recommend
cheers
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
me
a
bit
more
hoppiness
would
have
complemented
the
earthiness
id
like
to
try
this
again
overall
the
beer
isnt
very
complex
but
the
taste
is
very
good
the
flavours
are
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
id
buy
it
again
note
i
love
bspas
but
this
just
doesnt
match
up
with
the
likes
of
duvel
and
delirium
tremens
hades
is
an
acceptable
easy
drinker
with
similar
flavors
but
no
more
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
taste
this
against
authentic
belgians
in
the
same
style
i
think
this
version
would
prove
more
drinkable
great
divide
does
the
belgian
styles
better
than
their
other
beers
i
think
the
hades
belgica
and
hoss
are
my
favorites
i
so
wanna
take
cerberus
for
a
walk
like
that
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
orange
peel
nutmeg
black
pepper
bread
yeast
and
coriander
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mandarin
orange
syrup
orange
rind
clove
black
pepper
cardamom
greens
and
a
touch
of
flowers
in
the
background
a
strange
orangeresin
bitterness
pervades
holding
steady
in
intensity
throughout
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
overall
a
nice
bspa
but
the
flavors
just
arent
for
me
a
didnt
get
that
out
of
the
beer
they
might
be
reviewing
partly
based
on
price
not
sure
anyways
tasted
like
a
collaboration
between
a
pale
and
ale
and
a
belgian
style
ale
leaning
more
towards
pale
not
much
complexity
to
it
light
yellow
in
color
not
much
head
cheers
o
very
tasty
belgian
style
beer
o
very
disappointed

also
this

not
my
favorite
style
of
brew

i
do
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
it
certainly
stood
up
the
test
of
almost
4
years
flavor
is
a
rich
and
complex
mix
of
malty
sweetness
a
rush
of
spice
and
a
tinge
of
hops
the
finish
brings
on
an
alcohol
burn
layered
and
delightful
this
ones
a
unique
experience

definitely
brought

i
enjoyed
the

but
not
my
favorite
in

overall
this
is
an

belgian
ale
that
i
probably
would
not
buy
again
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
its
not
my
favorite
not
do
i
think
its
classified
properly
but
i
drank
it
and
enjoyed
it
not
sure
if
this
rating
is
just
a
result
my
style
preference
that
deviates
away
from
trippels
and
belgian
ales
but
overall
this
beer
delivers
in
every
way
according
to
guidelines
with
details
lacking
in
taste
and
aroma
definitely
worth
a
try
but
didnt
suit
my
palate

this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
great
divide
it
was
nice
to
drink
it
relatively
fresh
since
i
dont
see
this
specific
beer
from
great
divide
that
much
nothing
outstanding
but
its
good
d
enjoyable
as
a
sipper
no
doubt
this
is
a
full
8
brew
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
range
of
belgian
style
great

hades
is
a
crystal
clear
bright
golden
ale
with
a
soft
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
it
has
an
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
bubble
gum
banana
papaya
fresh
rich
soil
and
hay
its
medium
bodied
and
lively
the
finish
is
chewy
but
dry
its
quite
dry
and
pretty
bitter
it
tastes
very
earthy
with
notes
of
soil
hay
and
apples
theres
a
grassy
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
is
pretty
fun
to
drink
i
cant
ever
see
turning
this
down
drinkabilty
its
ok
to
drink
theres
nothing
special
about
this
and
i
relaly
dont
enjoy
the
aftertase
alcohol
is
right
at
the
limit
of
drinking
more
then
one
its
ok
nothing
special
alot
better
stuff
out
there
i
could
have
a
pint
or
2
but
that
is
all
if
true
to
style
and
represenitive
it
is
a
quality
brew
usually
im
fairly
happy
with
this
brewery
sorry
guys
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
this
one
keep
the
yeast
strain
and
scratch
the
rest
great
divides
belgian
style
offerings
have
never
impressed
me
hades
is
no
exception
theres
nothing
bad
here
its
just
wanting
of
elegance
and
nuance
relative
to
the
flagbearers
of
the
style
smells
tame
but
pleasant
with
floral
clove
and
tangy
yeast
aromas
all
present
but
all
mild
tastes
a
touch
more
lively
with
a
certain
spiciness
white
pepper
and
a
bit
of
lemon
perking
things
up
lacking
in
crispness
and
carbonation
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
clingy
sweetness
in
the
finish
its
not
bad
at
all
but
its
pretty
forgettable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
a
tasty
drinkable
ale
for
sure
notes
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
great
divide
d
another
fantastic
great
divide
beer
this
is
a
great
session
and
sipping
beer
offer
it
to
your
skeptical
macroloving
friends
i
will
most
assuredly
being
going
back
and
buying
more
of
this

for

with

belgian
flavor
malt
profile
is
moderate
with
little
to
no

thin

with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
extraordinary
d
low
based
on
the
unpleasant
taste
and
worse
aftertaste
drinking
it
reminded
me
of
an
american
pale
adjunct
lager
a
friend
i
shared
my
bottle
with
felt
the
same
way
quite
happy
that
i
split
the
12
oz
despite
my
usual
enjoyment
of
great
divide
products
i
generally
enjoy
belgian
strong
pale
ales
and
in
a
blind
taste
test
it
would
have
taken
me
a
very
long
time
to
identify
this
as
such
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
its
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
bland
for
the
style
not
one
of
my
favorites
at
all
but
its
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
the
aroma
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
rasins
its
very
crisp
and
citrusy
its
over
all
a
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
however
im
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
its
name
i
would
expect
more
from
a
beer
called
hades
over
all
i
liked
this
beer
i
think
of
it
more
as
a
spring
time
or
summer
brew
this
is
a
solid
beer
nice
representation
of
the
style
nothing
fancy
and
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
not
shallow
by
any
means
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
to
be
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
missing
something
to
put
it
over
the
top
although
i
was
not
upset
to
have
bought
it
i
most
likely
will
not
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
pretty
straightforward
bspa
that
delivers
as
expected
refreshing
somewhat
complex
and
quite
good
even
if
it
doesnt
reach
the
heights
of
most
belgianmade

over

pretty

i
enjoyed
this
one
especially
for
the
style
overall
probably
my
favorite
of
the
mix
pack
which
included
rumble
titan
and
samurai
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
abv
on
the
bottle
and
no
freshnessbottling
date
pale
yellowstraw
colored
thin

with
little

the
aroma
of
yeast
was
all
over
the
place
with
underlying
fruity
notes
mostly
bananaacetates
taste
is
crisp
mildly
sweet
with
a
distinct
bitter
finish
this
is
a
not
the
easiest
of
belgian
ales
to
describe
not
quite
a
beer
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
is
still
a
good
brew
to
try
once
interesting
beer
from
great
divide
drink
would
have
been
nice
to
have
another
one
while
enjoying
my
meal
but
only
bought
a
single
12oz
good
beer
drinkability
this
was
quite
the
drinkable
ale
its
on
the
light
side
of
the
style
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
heavyhitter
youll
be
disappointed
but
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
drink
edit
tried
a
second
bottle
poured
at
no
angle
from
2
inches
above
the
glass
and
still
got
less
than
a
finger
of
head
disappointing
brew
this
one
is
a
fruit
forward
bspa
it
blends
nicely
with
the
sweet
malt
i
liked
it
more
with
every
sip
great
divide
has
done
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
its
thick
and
robust
while
being
light
and
fluffy
at
the
same
time
this
quality
makes
it
very
drinkable
which
for
a
7
8
brew
can
be
pretty
dangerous
although
enjoyable
nonetheless
really
not
particularly
pleasant
also
too
flat
this
beer
is
extremely
clear
no
haze
at
all
a
steady
stream
of
small
bubble
emerge
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
smells
fruity
and
estery
strong
hints
of
banana
the
taste
follows
with
nice
spicy
clove
notes
in
addition
to
the
fruit
tastes
a
little
hot
for
a
7
8
beer
first
review
thanks
for
reading
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
absolutely
no
head
it
was
carbonated
i
swear
just
had
no
head
the
aroma
had
strong
hints
of
a
river
bank
where
fish
have
washed
up
the
taste
was
very
wheaty
with
slight
hints
of
apple
juice
overall
not
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
this
brewery
makes
great
beers
but
fell
short
on
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
dont
even
like
clove
at
all
lightly
bitter
and
long
dry
finish
light
and
easy
drinking
nice
and
refreshing
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
like
a
belgian
beer
with
the
yeast
having
a
good
presence
along
with
slight
apples
but
i
could
detect
sweet
malts
hops
a
liitle
citrus
and
spice
like
the
nose
belgian
yeast
was
definitely
there
but
it
did
have
more
of
a
spice
kick
on
the
palate
with
slight
citrus
malts
and
hoppy
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
hoppy
slight
spice
finish
it
drank
quite
well
and
would
like
to
have
some
more
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
a
category
in
which
the
americans
are
clearly
in
catch
up
mode
towards
the
belgians
classic
flavours
and
at
1
99
a
single
it
is
extremely
well
priced
in
a
category
where
the
average
belgian
is
sitting
at
4
and
for
that
reason
alone
is
worth
a
rebuy
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
very
fruity
yeast
character
its
dry
and
peppery
with
a
bit
of
funk
as
well
there
is
light
hop
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
tremendous
yeast
character
but
it
lacks
depth
in
the
malt
bill
it
could
use
a
specialty
malt
or
two
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
yeast
provides
tons
of
complexity
its
dry
and
funky
with
pepperysaison
like
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian
inspired
beer
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
transition
someone
into
this
style
its
full
of
esters
and
drinks
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
cannot
detect
any
of
the
abv
is
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
not
really
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
golden
ale
with
a
bit
of
belgian
flare
all
in
all
its
just
about
perfect
for
style
there
isnt
much
of
anything
about
this
beer
that
i
would
say
wasnt
done
well
a
keeper
on
my
shelf
d
wouldnt
call
this
my
favorite
belgian
the
more
i
drank
the
beer
the
more
it
began
to
nag
on
me
m
high
carbonation
this
should
be
a
prickly
beer
anyway
but
its
a
bit
much
not
too
dry
but
there
is
a
powdery
yeasty
feel
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
well
brewed
true
to
style
considerably
cheaper
than
duvel
and
delicious
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
and
recommend
trying
it
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
as
its
nicely
carbed
and
has
medium
body
but
the
finish
is
slightly
watery
enough
to
not
only
notice
but
to
be
distracted
by
overall
this
was
nice
im
not
saying
its
up
there
with
duvel
or
damnation
but
its
refreshing
and
more
of
a
light
summery
take
on
the
style
would
drink
again
for
sure
overall
not
bad
solid
american
take
on
the
bspa
style
d
quite
good
pity
those
who
drink
this
from
a
bottle
a
belgianstyle
like
this
needs
to
be
opened
up
and
explored
not
simply
peer
upon
its
surface
with
crude
glugglugs
from
a
dusty
dirty
old
bottle
pour
this
in
a
proper
glass
and
tell
me
its
not
greatfor
its
strength
id
like
a
few
more
of
these
please
d
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
do
not
want
to
buy
it
again
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
the
medium
body
is
kept
alive
and
easily
drinkable
by
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
overall
crispness
the
feel
is
almost
cottony
as
it
fades
into
a
lingering
chalky
finish
dit
is
drinkable
but
for
the
style
i
found
it
lacking
i
would
drink
this
if
others
of
the
style
are
not
available
but
i
would
rather
have
a
duvel
thinnish
head
of
about
a
finger
or
so
pure
white
without
much
retention
fluffy
no
lacing
either
light
metallic
glow
to
the
mild
orange
to
yellow
color
clear
with
scattered
minuscule
bubbles
here
and
there
yeasty
herbaceous
nose
with
an
ashen
stony
stripe
not
bitter
but
stiff
nostril
presence
pepper
cumin
coriander
spice
acts
like
its
going
to
hit
you
with
the
banana
then
swerves
into
green
apple
pear
and
sour
lemons
abundance
of
wheat
germ
straw
and
hay
earthy
enough
that
theres
minimal
lift
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
adds
a
soft
round
texture
to
the
mouth
helpful
given
the
general
tartness
of
the
flavors
peppery
dried
yeast
cells
raw
wheat
and
unprocessed
grains
the
lemon
to
grapefruit
citrus
dried
out
and
evanescent
not
much
more
can
be
said
for
the
peach
apricot
pear
red
apple
fruit
in
spite
of
the
downy
carbonation
clove
and
coriander
as
well
as
some
crushed
flowers
do
pretty
up
the
finish
no
glaring
flaws
just
kinda
boring
d
this
is
a
decent
belgian
golden
ale
but
diverges
slightly
from
the
norm
as
the
yeast
esters
are
really
restrained
and
the
hop
presence
is
a
bit
more
than
expected
really
it
seems
more
light
a
trappiststyle
tripel
in
nature
with
the
hops
focused
as
they
are
nonetheless
its
worth
a
try
and
worth
the
money
just
might
not
meet
some
expectations
for
the
style
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
pale
ale
what
i
would
expect
the
style
to
be
and
very
enjoyable
something
i
highly
recommend
dthe
yeast
flavors
lingered
throughout
which
could
be
a
negative
for
some
but
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
and
enough
going
on
to
hide
that
almost
8
abv
db
the
smell
got
me
very
excited
but
the
flavor
was
sort
of
average
once
again
belgian
notes
that
are
too
powerful
not
bad
by
any
means
but
there
needs
to
be
a
bit
less
bitterness
and
some
more
balance
here
not
my
favorite
great
divide
beer
thats
for
sure
very
very
drinkable
and
easily
pairs
wiht
lots
of
light
meats
and
veggies
a
good
food
beer
d
pretty
nice
belgian
style
ale
not
the
greatest
ive
ever
had
reminds
me
of
duvel
a
little
bit
but
i
would
rather
drink
duvel
anyday
worth
a
shot
however
average
drinkability
for
a
belgian
a
few
of
these
would
be
ok
even
with
the
moderate
to
high
alcohol
content
the
flavor
profile
is
bursting
at
the
seams
yet
there
is
a
level
of
drinkablity
that
stays
true
even
for
its
slightly
higher
than
average
abv
a
rare
belgian
yeast
strain
is
used
and
it
shows
the
rarest
of
the
trappist
brews
come
to
mind
with
each
sipa
guess
of
course
a
bullseye
for
great
divide
here
its
great
to
see
a
craft
brewer
tackle
such
a
temperamental
style
and
come
out
on

the
appearance
is
golden
in
color
to
almost
light
amber
the
nose
reveals
malt
and
grassy
tones
taste
is
all
about
the
herbal
belgian
yeast
malty

distinctive

mouthfeel
is
very
light
for

drinkability
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
belgian
styles
it
is
very
high
i
had
this
at
room
temp
and
it
was
very
good
it
has
a
rustic
refinement
at
room
temp
sounds
like
a
misnomer
but
until
you
try
it
it
seems
to
fit
simliar
to
style
of
celis
grand
cru
i
like
celis
grand
cru
but
this
is
better
tastes
cleaner
very
true
to
style
without
a
doubt
worth
trying
f
finishes
mostly
dry
but
not
too
dry
some
more
belgian
malts
and
yeast
flavors
with
a
hint
of
fermented
and
dried
belgian
candi
sugar
that
has
turned
to
dry
feel
and
a
touch
of
boose
hints
of
wheat
again
with
a
little
banana
and
lemongrass
more
fruit
with
a
little
citrus
to
go
with
the
wheat
chewy
malts
belgian
malts
and
slight
toasty
malts
linger
slight
lingering
grassy
bitterness
another
great
offering
from
great
divide
like
belgium
pale
ales
like
american
brewers
cheers
this
one
is
good
for
you
taste
a
little
underwhelming
looking
for
a
little
more
but
nonetheless
a
nice
beer
for
my
money
prefer
pranqster
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
for
a
belgian
and
a
small
white
ring
smell
is
clove
and
yeast
with
bread
and
citrus
taste
is
same
with
yeast
and
clove
with
bread
and
malt
then
a
crisp
citrus
zing
mouth
feel
is
light
medium
with
a
good
finish
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
or
from
great
divide
i
really
have
a
thing
for
duvel
i
am
pretty
hard
on
beers
in
this
category
because
i
cant
help
but
judge
them
with
duvel
as
the
ideal
i
enjoyed
hades
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
aged
bspas
but
i
really
liked
this
could
have
been
more
complex
great
divide
rarely
disappoints
and
that
trend
continues
here
a
little
fruitier
in
aroma
than
the
original
but
great
pale
copper
color
with
good
light
carbonation
ill
get
this
again
and
again
md
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
little
bubbles
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
then
again
great
divide
typically
does
not
disappoint
well
i
finished
off
my
keg
of
this
stuff
and
released
i
never
did
review
it
so
i
figured
id
go
ahead
and
review
it
has
a
really
nice
cloudy
orange
color
to
it
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
really
had
a
big
white
head
that
laces
a
bit
smell
is
good
has
a
great
yeasty
aroma
to
it
like
all
great
belgian
or
belgian
style
the
yeast
is
a
huge
part
of
the
beer
taste
is
good
too
while
at
nearly
8
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
tell
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
a
very
good
one
id
defintely
buy
another
keg
of
this
beauty
very
easy
drinking
drinks
like
a
lighter
duvel
overall
not
bad
a
liked
this
better
than
i
did
i
enjoyed
the
drink
as
well
onthis
one
so
light
and
refreshing
never
taste
or
feel
the
near
8
a
very
nice
beer
to
session
good
for
them
hot
days
as
far
as
american
belgian
pales
go
this
is
top
notch
goes
down
too
easy
i
highly
recommend
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
capped
off
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
a
light
hoppy
aroma
along
with
white
pepper
honey
and
a
light
fruitiness
some
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
along
with
some
belgian
spices
honey
malt
and
yeast
a
nice
solid
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
more
overall
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
brew
with
so
many
takes
on
belgian
style
ales
around
hades
really
manned
up
i
could
definitely
see
getting
this
again
overall
good
american
take
of
a
belgian
style
ale
impressed
by
great
divide
brewery
pours
a
mrdium
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
decent
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
is

body
is

is
of

up

with
a
nice
tart

clove
and
spice
through
out
really
nice
for
the
warmer
weatheror
anytime
drinkability
is
good
especially
for
somewhat
high
alcohol
beer
d
highly
recommended
try
with
good
artisanal
cheeses
or
an
omelet
a
crab
omelet
would
be
especially
nice
or

or
asparagus
excellent
beer
and
drinks
really
easy
the
abv
may
be
a
bit
high
to
be
marked
as
sessionable
but
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
in
the
taste
great
divide
has
done
it
again
folks
a
good
ale
id
drink
it
if
i
were
living
in
america
and
wanted
to
try
the
triple
style
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
american
version
of
a
belgian
beer
d
highly
recommended
try
with
good
artisanal
cheeses
or
an
omelet
a
crab
omelet
would
be
especially
nice
or
spinach
or
asparagus
d
not
enjoying
this
that
much
definitely
my
least
favorite
from
this
great
brewery
dthis
is
a
pretty
solid
tasting
beer
but
it
seems
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
not
a
bad
drink
and
definitely
quite
refreshing
effervescent
and
strongly
carbonated
certainly
drinkable
but
unless
it
is
in
someone
elses
fridge
it
wont
be
something
i
put
in
mine
pours
a
very
light
straw
yellow
color
with
a
film
head
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
wheat
and
some
breadiness
the
taste
is
of
a
wheat
backbone
with
a
lemon
kick
over
the
top
and
maybe
a
little
floral
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
the
drinkability
is
high
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
this
beer
very
solid
this
is
so
similar
in
style
to
duvel
but
it
doesnt
match
up
in
the
full
package
its
solid
but
not
great
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
translucent
straw
gold
with
a
two
inch
loose
bright
white
head
embedded
with
copious
tiny
bubbles
head
eventually
settles
into
a
skim
leaving
thick
delicate
bands
of
lacing
as
the
brew
recedes
nose
reveals
lemons
yeast
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
candi
sugar
very
subdued
taste
follows
nose
somewhat
dull
in
flavor
a
wheaty
quality
behind
a
mild
citrus
character
with
just
the
lightest
hint
of
candi
sugar
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
mild
background
carbonation
a
little
acidity
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
definitely
an
americanized
belgian
strong
pale
not
much
in
terms
of
a
belgian
yeast
character
and
lacking
the
big
candi
sugar
and
slightly
herbal
essence
common
to
the
style
all
and
all
pretty
bland
but
easy
drinking
with
a
wellhidden
abv
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
a
nice
taste
full
of
the
bready
yeast
and
a
balanced
grain
and
straw
malt
end
with
a
moderate
impact
of
dry
hops
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
is
covered
quite
well
an
excellent
beer
an
okay
belgianstyled
ale
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
standard
of
the
style
which
is
duvel
but
then
again
what
beer
does
value
all
in
all
a
decent
stab
at
a
belgian
ale
from
great
divide
i
cant
say
its
much
worse
than
chimay
blonde
and
about
13
the
price
plus
its
a
full
12
oz
bottle
i
dig
great
divide
good
drinkability
d
it
is
refreshing
with
moderately
high
abv
and
an
unobtrusive
character
so
its
very
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
prefer
this
given
reasonable
alternatives
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
the
best
thing
about
it
not
being
belgian
is
the
price
tag
80
off
of
course
its
all
about
the
taste
and
though
i
didnt
mark
the
taste
of
this
beer
as
good
its
more
than
adequate
with
nice
elements
to
it
t
this
is
yet
another
nice
offering
my
local
crew
at
great
divide
im
really
glad
i
stopped
into
the
tap
room
and
gave
it
a
whirl
i
was
expecting
this
to
fall
a
little
short
compared
to
its
real
belgian
contemporaries
but
it
certainly
lives
up
to
the
best
examples
of
the
style
the
feel
of
this
beer
light
and
pretty
easy
going
down
is
easy
on
the
pallet
and
is
refreshing
with
is
spicy
crisp
flavor
light
bodied
and
fizzy
a
bit
over
carbonated
very
nice
drnker
the
abv
is
not
noticable
not
really
sessionable
but
a
nice
drinker
poured
to
a
one
inch
head
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
head
was
white
in
color
ale
itself
was
a
cloudy
lemon
yellow
color
left
some
minimal
lacing
of
rings
when
drank
very
light
smelling
just
of
lemon
and
yeast
tasted
of
corriander
lemons
and
yeast
also
perhaps
of
bread
i
didnt
think
it
was
all
that
hoppy
had
a
slight
bitter
alcohol
aftertaste
felt
light
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
right
im
glad
i
tried
this
ale
i
just
dont
think
i
would
want
to
make
it
a
session
beer
pours
a
decent
straw
goldn
minimal
head
retention
is
kind
of
dissapointing
a
little
banana
in
the
nose
hops
as
well
not
too
sweet
up
front
crisp
sours
out
at
the
end
with
a
defined
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
finishes
moderately
dry
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
alcohol
comes
through
not
in
a
bad
way
d
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nicely
done
and
something
i
would
pick
up
again
well
balanced
and
just
enough
sweetness
and
spice
d
overall
im
not
sure
id
go
for
this
again
but
i
believe
its
worth
a
try
as
the
great
divide
has
som
great
brews
some
clove
some
continentalstyle
lemongrass
hops
with
a
decent
smack
of
alcohol
pretty
solid
effort
but
i
doubt
ill
be
back
notes
this
beer
really
made
a
comeback
in
my
book
since
the
look
and
the
smell
left
something
to
be
desired
but
this
is
a
nicely
brewed
belgian
pale
ale
that
really
hit
the
mark
another
nice
beer
from
great
divide
big
white
head
and
a
slightly
golden
yellow
body
head
retains
quite
well
and
laces
all
over
the
glass
the
body
is
lightly
turbid
the
nose
is
quite
bold
offering
up
a
large
grainy
presence
and
a
slight
sour
apple
flavour
there
is
minimal
to
no
yeast
spice
or
alcohol
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
much
like
the
la
chouffe
bspa
there
is
a
huge
artificial
banana
flavour
that
dominates
the
hops
fall
quite
short
in
restraining
the
sweetness
though
there
is
a
definite
bitter
aspect
to
the
beer
it
is
hardly
noticeable
to
any
great
extent
the
feel
is
medium
with
abundant
carbonation
which
could
be
crisper
drinkability
halfway
through
the
glass
i
thought
about
tossing
it
but
i
went
ahead
and
finished
but
i
would
never
buy
this
again
good
thing
i
just
got
a
single
in
a
mix6
pours
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
caramel
grains
spicy
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
also
sweet
but
a
bit
dull
for
the
style
some
nice
clove
and
peppery
yeast
flavors
though
medium
body
a
comes
off
a
tad
thick
not
bad
but
nothing
special
d
fairly
high
poured
from
a
12

lots
of

more

i
would
have
expected
carbonation

bitterness
in

at
the

drinkability
a
very
easy

offering
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
get
through
a
6
pack
of
these
at
all

poured
into
a
small
chalice
this
one
is
a
light
golden
color
very
fizzy
and
well
carbonated
from
appearances
alone
this
pretty
much
resembles
champagne
smell
is
bubblegum
spicy
peppery
and
slightly
sweet
taste
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
a
lot
more
in
terms
of
hoppiness
and
bitterness
mild
alcohol
punch
and
slight
grassy
flavors
d
a
nice
drinking
belgian
style
that
had
a
good
slightly
tart
and
dry
fruitiness
fit
per
style
that
was
easy
to
down
and
enjoy
fruity
spicy
with
a
dry
finish
will
keep
you
sippin
at

abv
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
before
you
tire
of
this
drink
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
with
a
nice
dry
champagne
finish
makes
this
a
recommend
d
should
be
drank
just
below
room
temp
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
again
after
having
drank
6
of
them
overall
i
was
not
that
impressed
d
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
style
by
a
long
shot
but
definitely
a
worthy
beer
all
the
same
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
overall
i
was
surprised
the
abv
was
as
high
as
it
is
on
this
i
thought
it
was
more
of
a
belgian
pale
and
thought
the
abv
was
following
that
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
you
probably
will
too
worth
a
shot
d
what
an
interesting
beer
great
classic
belgian
characteristics
with
solid
pale
influences
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
a
6pk
on
a
great
summers
day
would
not
last
long
let
alone
any
day
of
the
year
a
superb
example
of
the
style
it
is
drinkability
well
the
smell
and
taste
is
decent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
me
on
the
plus
side
there
is
very
little
noticable
alcohol
and
its
quite
refreshing
not
bad
not
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
at
7
8
abv
the
alcohol
is
rather
well
hidden
excellent
summer
beer
overall
a
nice
affordable
belgian
strong
pale
not
the
best
but
certainly
tasty
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
i
was
expecting
better
but
got
a
wholly
inoffensive
but
generally
average
beer
pours
a
pale
yellowygolden
with
bright
white
foam
and
is
slightly
hazyin
a
nice
sort
of
way
nose
is
quite
bready
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
some
faint
spice
notes
very
nice
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
elegant
with
brisk
effervescence
taste
is
nice
and
dry
with
just
the
faintest
bi
of
honey
finish
is
not
particularly
dry
but
lingers
with
a
pretty
characteristic
golden
ale
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
although
the
name
throws
me
a
bit
the
beer
actually
seems
quite
friendly
and
tame
not
really
one
i
would
associate
with
the
underworld
if
i
had
my
druthers
i
might
prefer
a
bit
more
complexity
with
a
punch
worth
a
try
though
especially
since
its
quite
refreshing
overall
light
but
flavorful
and
enjoyable
good
carbonation
refreshingly
light
on
this
summer
day
not
bad
but
a
little
disappointing
1xdnl
d
i
could
slug
this
down
because
there
isnt
that
much
flavor
but
i
would
find
myself
wanting
more
d
this
is
a
good
belgian
with
all
things
considered
they
wont
put
duvel
out
of
business
but
a
good
economical
alternative
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
drinkability
strikes
me
as
being
very
average
for
the
style
there
is
not
enough
going
on
here
to
make
me
want
to
reach
for
another
one
single
from
grape
gourmet

poured
a
golden
color
with
remarkable
clarity
topped
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aromas
were
fruity
reminiscent
of
apple
juice
with
some
familiar
belgian
yeasts
tastes
were
also
fruity
apples
with
hints
of
pear
and
banana
alcohol
at

seemed
nonexistent
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
has
good
carbonation
finishes
extremely
crisp
and
is
very
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
at
the
end
overall
decent
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
flavors
seemed
on
the
weaker
side
i
hate
to
say
watery
but
maybe
more
like
apple
juice
essentially
i
expected
it
to
be
more
belgian
and
more
bold
in
flavor
this
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
white

with

it
tasted
like
lemon
and
grassy
hops
with
sour
belgian
yeast
and
some
earthy
wheat
it
was
a
bit
oily
with
a
little
carbonation
and
had
a
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
pretty
basic
and
simple
for
a
belgian
style
ale
it
had
a
clean
taste
but
the
flavor
wasnt
exciting
or
very
rewarding
it
was
just
a
sour
pale
ale
with
mediocre
body
however
it
did
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
not
bad
but
probably
not
worth
buying
again
i
prefer
something
with
more
character
d
the
alcohol
and
spices
combined
with
the
large
amount
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
weird
combination
something
i
wont
touch
again
for
a
while
hopefully
some
time
smooths
this
one
out
in
its
current
state
its
just
not
for
me
i
saw
the
review
after
buying
this
beer
and
much
to
my
surprise
i
was
blown
away
as
someone
who
is
recently
getting
into
the
belgian
strong
pale
i
found
the
hades
to
be
very
well
balanced
especially
drinkable
and
perfect
at
the
evening
bbq
i
was
attending
the
consensus
around
the
table
was
clear
hades
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
maybe
because
i
got
a
very
fresh
new
label
bottle
but
this
was
no

but
it
seems
a

this

they
claim

i

great

hades
ale
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
little
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
fairly
strong
mostly
of
yeast
according
to
the
bottle
its
a
rare
belgian
yeast
strain
that
gives
a
complex
spice
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
definitely
a
smooth
beer
with
a
medium
to
strong
yeasty
aftertaste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
yeast
taste
in
beer
but
this
will
be
manageable
to
finish
those
of
you
who
like
the
malt
and
hops
flavor
of
beer
this
one
can
be
skipped
however
on
the
flipside
if
you
like
or
want
to
try
a
yeasty
beer
give
this
one
a
try
ah
the
taste
is
closer
to
the
real
thing
some
citrus
and
a
good
amount
of
wheat
flavor
the
swallow
features
stronger
wheat
that
dissipates
rapidly
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
low
body
texture
d
pretty
good
drinkability
but
not
good
enough
the
real
problem
here
is
the
residual
sweetness
this
beer
just
isnt
dry
enough
for
the
style
and
even
disregarding
style
it
is
kind
of
cloying
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
a
little
flat
as
well
but
in
all
fairness
that
wouldnt
have
been
as
noticeable
if
the
aroma
wasnt
so
pleasant
fairly
thin
bodied
but
rounds
out
quite
nicely
and
feels
a
bit
fuller

it

crisp

to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
of
belgian
yeast
and
slight
sweet

the
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
and
had
far
less
hop
character
than
i
would
expect
from
any
pale
even
belgian
still
somewhat
enjoyable
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
rather
crisp
with
a
nice

carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer

not
one

pick

with
a
slight

this
is
a
great
beer
from
an
even
better
brewery
i
wish
it
appealed
a
little
more
to
me

this
is

their
worst

sorry

for
the
style
which
bordered

not
one
ill
be
returning
to
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
belgianesque
but
not
up
to
the
standard
of
the
finest
belgian
ales
still
a
very
tasty
brew
recommended
crisp
thin
mouthfeel
with
a

this
is
an
overall
easy
drinking
brew
but
not
what
i
want
when
looking
for
a
bspa
until
then
pick
this
one
up
once
only
and
just
for
the
novelty
of
something
new
from
great
divide
d
a
wonderful
belgian
carries
every
characteristic
of
a
delicious
strong
pale
the
drinkability
is
good
as
this
beer
has
no
qualities
that
are
offensive
likewise
there
are
no
qualities
that
evoke
the
giddy
enthusiasm
that
comes
with
a
truly
outstanding
brew
it
is
light
a
bit
bland
but
decent
no
disappointment
here
but
no
overwhelming
sensation
either
a
one
night
stand
to
be
certain
cheers
pours
golden
with
bright
highlights
and

aromas
are
of
zesty
almost
salty

and

its
got
an
earthiness
that
reminds
of

on

not
the

from

usually
fine
brewery
and
not
something
that
i
am
eager
to
try
again
and
almost
makes
me
want
to
suggest
to
the
brewery
to
stay
away
from
belgian
ale
and
keep
doing
the
ipaiipa
and
is
not
totally
impressed
but
not
let
down
im
sure
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
so
i
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
nice
effort
by
great
divide
who
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
decent
bspa
but
not
my
favorite
something
i
will
have
again
this
is
wonderful
for
a
filtered
wheat
beer
almost
all
the
yeast
taste
still
lingers
this
is
a
good
one
that
a
myriad
of
beer
fans
will
enjoy
this
beer
was
carbonated
partially
cloudy
and
yellowish
in
color
the
smell
is
like
a
hot
macro
corny
and
rice
like
the
taste
is
slightly
bannanna
like
and
the
alcohol
has
quite
a
burn
this
beer
is
a
sipper
a
real
ear
warmer
i
would
possibly
drink
this
again
at
some
point
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
this
is
a
sipper
its
also
a
one
and
done
for
me
it
does
posses
a
nice
mouthfeel
as
stated
crisp
but
not
overwhelming
one
can
drink
it
pretty
easily
but
this
isnt
the
best
beer
out
there
if
your
store
carries
it
there
is
a
good
chance
your
money
is
spent
elsewhere
one
different
beers
but
its
not
totally
a
waste
and
if
you
love
the
style
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
suspect
you
wont
mind
it
too
much
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
basic
entry
into
the
world
of
belgianstyle
ales
but
i
could
not
see
myself
not
recommending
it
its
flavourful
and
interesting
enough
to
rule
that
possibility
out
give
it
a
shot
and
see
what
you
think
of
it
overall
a
mediocre
outing
from
great
divide
i
normally
enjoy
their
beers
but
this
tastes
kind
of
like
a
belgian
malt
liquor
it
does
improve
some
as
it
warms
and
i
enjoy
it
more
as
i
get
through
the
bottle
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
in
decatur
ga
im
usually
a
pretty
big
fan
of
great
divide
but
this
beer
was
just
not
that
great
especially
compared
to
the
other
belgian
and
belgian
style
options
out
there
this
one
didnt
fly
pours
a
fairly
light
golden
with
a
very
nice
head
big
and
fluffy
looking
but
with
some
decent
density
so
far
so
good
the
smell
isnt
welcoming
there
is
sharp
apple
wintergreen
and
a
slight
bit
of
floral
hops
somewhat
harsh
and
not
that
well
integrated
the
taste
is
pretty
thin
up
front
but
develops
flavors
of
crisp
red
apple
with
peel
banana
bubblegum
and
some
late
astringency
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
lacks
integration
balance
and
robustness
could
also
use
a
little
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
bodied
but
somewhat
slick
really
why
bother
try
it
once
and
maybe
again
in
a
year
to
see
if
its
any
better
integrated
but
there
are
so
many
better
options
out
there
ill
stick
to
their
non
belgian
stuff
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
solid
outing
for
a
brewery
that
does
not
specialize
in
belgian
style
ales
it
becomes
more
appealing
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
so
keep
that
in
mind
and
the
7
3
abv
is
masked
quite
well
in
all
honesty
great
divide
beers
are
among
my
favorites
and
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
but
its
not
great
and
id
just
as
soon
be
drinking
a
proper
belgian
ale
in
the
end
drinkability
i
will
say
that
when
faced
with
the
task
of
soothing
my
harried
nerves
after
navigating
my
way
through
atlanta
traffic
the
great
divide
hades
did
a
bang
up
job
ive
loved
every
other
gd
bomber
ive
had
this
brew
is
an
aberration
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
since
belgian
ales
dont
seem
to
be
part
of
great
divides
usual
repertoire
no
need
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
strong
belgian
like
duvel
definitely
worth
picking
up
again
good
drinkability
and
in
the
context
of
a
summer
release
excellent
for
a
warm
day
something
it
might
be
nice
to
grab
sixer
of
rather
than
a
bomber
but
a
little
high
on
the
booze
side
of
things
to
drink
too
many
of
so
maybe
the
bomber
works
better
this
beer
is
for
real
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
immediately
reminiscent
of
of
duvel
or
a
wit
with
a
kick
for
the
spice
the
flavor
is
deep
its
starts
sweet
and
bready
then
bitterness
grows
while
coriander
vanilla
and
cream
come
through
with
a
touch
of
belgian
candi
the
aftertaste
is
a
long
continuation
of
the
spice
and
sweet
malts
oh
so
drinkable
my
only
negative
comments
are
that
this
beer
lacks
the
mouthfeel
a
touch
weak
on
the
carbonation
and
rocky
head
that
help
round
out
a
great
pale
belgian
still
damn
tasty
find
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
great
divide
but
i
have
to
confess
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavorwise
oh
well
drinkability
is
for
me
not
that
great
cant
get
over
the
harsh
start
to
this
one
saw
this
one
in
the
store
for
the
first
time
today
so
i
was
quick
to
see
what
it
was
poured
into
an
over
sized
wine
glass
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
white
ring
head
in
the
nose
was
dry
champaign
grains
and
a
very
faint
fruit
presence
taste
held
pretty
much
the
same
characters
found
in
the
smell
save
for
a
slight
white
wine
taste
in
the
beginning
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
certainly
seems
to
be
a
very
balanced
beer
as
well
one
bomber
of
this
will
be
plenty
for
me
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
bit
on
the
boring
side
great
divide
is
a
favorite
brewer
of
mine
and
this
beer
holds
its
own
against
the
belgian
examples
i
miss
the
giant
foamy
head
but
its
nice
not
having
to
pour
so
carefully
too
aroma
was
balanced
with
some
citrus
a
bit
of
pine
biscuit
sweet
malt
taste
follows
aroma
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
the
yeast
richness
faded
after
initial
sip
this
is
a
good
one
for
the
summer
sitting
on
the
porch
on
tap
at
falling
rock
during
their
10th
anniversary
week
crystal
clear
bright
and
pale
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
dense
head
that
falls
away
shortly
excellent
carbonation
helps
sustain
a
thin
lingering
head
though
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
smooth
esters
and
a
hint
of
yeast
tastes
slightly
fruity
with
a
low
hop
flavor
that
blends
well
with
the
overall
profile
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overly
so
feels
creamier
than
it
should
for
a
dry
beer
id
have
to
credit
the
co2
level
for
perceived
body
this
isnt
a
session
beer
but
it
sure
drinks
like
one
this
was
described
as
a
belgian
golden
ale
to
me
by
the
bartender
in
the
tap
room
at
great
divide
the
color
was
clear
yellow
and
the
brew
had
a
very
small
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quick
i
thought
the
carbonation
lent
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
the
smell
was
slightly
yeasty
and
bananalike
the
taste
was
spicy
and
like
bubblegum
i
kept
trying
to
think
of
which
gum
it
reminded
me
of
this
was
a
pretty
good
ale
good
for
the
style
aging
fairly
slowly
had
this
one
in
the
cellar
2
years
drinkby
date

on

one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
ales
i
have
tasted
very
different
approach
i
will
buy
a
bottle
to
cellar
750

is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight

present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
strong
ale
all
around
great
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
spice
and
yeast
ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
pretty
standard
belgian
strong
age
has
faired
this
a
bit
better
than
expected
but
i
probably
should
have
drank
it
sooner
still
overall
its
good
but
too
heavy
i
enjoy
the
spice
combination
as
strong
as
it
is
overall
excellent
a
really
good
bspa
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
disappates
into
a
small
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
great
aroma
filled
with
lemon
coriander
and
pepper
lots
of
spice
in
the
flavor
but
not
overpowering
a
touch
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
is
more
warming
than
uninviting
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
southampton
to
date
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
an
interesting
and
heavily
spiced
bspa
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
a
lot
of
bspas
tend
to
be
this
one
is
bigger
smoother
and
spicier
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
quite
complex
i
prefer
mine
on
the
lighter
crisper
side
but
this
is
still
quite
good
drinkability
is
oddly
high
despite
the
abv
its
oddly
smooth
o
super
better
than
the
beast
avery
brewing
imo
these
being
my
only
two
grand
cru
bspas
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
but
with
more
spices
and
less
fruity
flavors
has
the
same
soft
character
and
grace
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
spices
belgian
yeast
and
some
slight
citrus
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
spices
lingering
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
set
of
aromas
and
an
even
better
taste
o
a
pretty
substantial
letdown
since
im
a
huge
southampton
fan
this
is
only
the
second
beer
of
theirs
i
consider
just
ok
o
enjoyable
but
not
a
real
easy
drinker
there
is
just
too
much
alcohol
presence
to
be
an
easy
drinker
i
think
this
is
a
more
sipping
over
an
hour
or
so
kind
of
beer
very
nice
beer
80100
o
i
fell
in
love
with
the
first
sip
but
turns
out
it
was
just
infatuation
o
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
southampton
glad
to
see
one
of
the
locals
do
a
good
take
on
a
belgian
style
southampton
grand
cru
glides
into
the
glass
golden
with
a
small
tint
of
faded
bronze
within
a
nice
sheet
of
bright
white
up
top
leaving
a
cap
and
small
splotches
ok
retention
smell
is
fruity
with
a
bready
belgian
yeast
with
trace
amounts
of
candi
no
grassy
scents
some
hints
of
alcohol
pretty
bold
in
scent
off
the
tap
with
a
bit
candi
like
scent
than
alot
of
american
versions
taste
is
up
front
with
belgian
essence
and
a
fruit
apple
pear
small
earthy
hop
bite
in
between
with
some
candi
sugar
in
the
end
that
does
not
cloy
first
sips
give
off
some
alcohol
that
warms
the
gullet
the
9
5
is
not
all
the
way
hidden
feel
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
nice
crisp
carb
after
half
the
glass
this
becomes
all
to
easy
to
drink
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
and
much
better
than
alot
of
american
versions
out
there
i
just
wish
bottles
were
not
so
damn
pricey
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
slide
into
4
packs
or
so
until
then
ill
grab
it
on
tap
amazing
price
on
this
beer
and
its
well
worth
the
money
thanks
again
j
ryans
for
providing
outstanding
beer
at
reasonable
prices
o
this
is
the
only
beer
i
have
had
from
southampton
but
it
makes
me
want
to
try
their
others
it
really
is
a
nice
beer
the
first
night
i
tried
it
i
had
a
couple
glasses
with
a
meal
and
thought
it
was
fantastic
so
good
that
i
wanted
to
go
back
just
to
try
it
again
on
its
own
to
see
if
it
was
really
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
is
nicely
complex
subtle
and
balanced
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
american
belgianstyle
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
feel
and
modest
to
lower
levtl
of
carbobation
that
gives
fhe
impression
of
a
thicker
feeling
brew
yet
somehow
it
is
fizzy
in
the
feel
when
swirled
around
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
behind
the
bold
sweetness
overall
not
a
bad
offering
but
much
much
more
sweet
than
i
was
expecting
o
the
beer
seems
to
be
more
malty
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
isnt
cloying
for
that
reason
alone
its
not
a
completely
high
rated
beer
to
me
but
ill
be
blown
away
if
it
stops
being
highly
rated
because
it
is
damn
well
crafted
and
perfect
for
after
football
cheers
to
double
windsor
for
pouring
it
on
tap
i
picked
up
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
at
anoconas
wines
and
spirits
the
appearance
is
a
nice
honey
color
with
nearly
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
to
it
served
in
a
wide
wine
glass
the
nose
of
this
grand
cru
has
coriander
citrus
and
some
funk
its
taste
comes
through
with
orange
anise
candied
goodness
mmm
the
body
is
fairly
lean
for
the
abv
but
with
a
sharp
carbonation
it
is
a
remarkably
good
beer
and
its
one
that
i
waited
longer
than
i
should
have
to
pick
up
overall
the
bottle
was
1
52
years
old
and
age
wasnt
very
kind
to
it
the
sweetness
was
too
much
and
the
flavors
seem
too
muddled
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
for
comparison
but
the
aged
version
was
something
id
not
seek
again
overall
very
good
a
decent
version
of
an
americanized
belgian
grand
cru
similar
to
their
abt12
but
lighter
and
more
fruit
complex
and
good
hides
the
booze
decently
well
great
flavors
o
spice
is
often
used
to
cover
things
up
they
should
have
tried
to
cover
up
the
spice
with
this
one
not
a
fan
drinkability
is
high
on
this
brew
it
takes
a
hit
on
the
appearance
and
it
can
get
a
little
sweet
after
a
couple
of
glasses
other
then
that
this
a
great
beer
and
i
am
isoing
this
asap
i
want
more
great
brew
o
grand
cru
typically
denotes
the
best
a
brewery
has
to
offer
while
this
may
not
be
my
outright
favorite
of
the
southamptons
ive
enjoyed
its
definitely
among
them
a
superb
accompaniment
with
dinner
soba
noodles
and
braised
vegetables
hanger
steak
on
the
side
and
for
sipping
after
much
warming
a
bit
later
my
second
time
trying
this
terrific
beer
looking
forward
to
the
third
and
beyond
this
beer
quaffs
way
too
easily
just
had
some
pliny
the
younger
last
night
so
this
is
two
nights
in
a
row
of
high
abv
brews
that
go
down
easy
and
delicious
southampton
nailed
this
outstanding
very
fruity
with
grainy
malts
and
high
alcohol
this
could
pass
for
a
triple
were
it
not
for
the
coriander
maple
syrup
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
the
yeast
esters
are
all
over
the
map
fruit
bread
dough
herbal
very
belgiany
beer
quite
complex
and
spices
are
fairly
lowkey
for
some
reason
though
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
sweet
and
the
esters
really
never
come
together
well
seems
like
others
like
it
so
maybe
this
ones
just
not
for
me
happy
new
year
the
star
anise
no
nope
nope
nope
i
hate
hate
hate
star
anise
flavors
i
can
stand
them
and
appreciate
it
however
i
despise
it
thankfully
it
is
not
here
at
all
thought
i
mean
i
think
i
should
be
able
to
pick
it
out
since
it
causes
a
gag
reflex
at
too
high
of
a
concentration
beer
finishes
really
dry
thats
the
first
thing
i
notice
sweet
up
front
with
some
interesting
esters
in
the
midpalate
minimal
spice
for
an
ale
that
is
advertised
as
a
spice
ale
but
i
actually
like
that
the
spices
are
kind
of
hidden
there
is
some
bitterness
that
i
am
picking
up
now
with
the
finish
of
the
beer
the
yeast
character
is
coming
through
more
now
the
ester
levels
are
growing
and
its
a
great
feeling
beer
id
have
it
again
for
sure
very
nice
i
need
to
drink
more
south
hampton
beers
one
of
the
great
strong
pale
ales
hard
to
slow
down
and
take
all
the
flavor
in
with
the
high
abv
slowing
down
is
necessary
this
is
a
beer
with
all
kinds
of
complexity
a
light
easytodrink
body
a
nice
shot
of
spices
that
dont
go
over
the
top
very
good
brew
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
complex
but
very
quaffable
at
the
same
time
and
it
packs
a
serious
punch
i
recommend
trying
this
one
wholeheartedly
this
is
clearly
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
southampton
publick
house
well
done
the
only
thing
american
made
belgians
cannot
seem
to
duplicate
is
the
head
of
the
brew
this
one
is
no
different
a
bit
of
a
soapy
head
and
it
goes
down
quickly
that
is
the
only
negative
as
it
pours
a
cool
bright
caramel
color
scents
of
belgian
candy
sweet
coriander
pepper
taste
is
unique
a
bunch
of
describable
flavors
hit
the
palate
immediately
followed
by
a
sweet
appley
aftertaste
almost
like
a
cream
soda
it
is
sweet
which
i
do
not
usually
care
for
but
this
has
a
different
taste
to
it
very
warming
alcohol
and
a
real
treat
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
db
citrus
and
spice
are
huge
but
do
not
bother
me
as
much
as
some
other
belgians
maybe
the
caramel
malt
is
balancing
it
alcohol
adds
some
harshness
lots
of
fruit
as
well
split
the
bottle
for
sure
hope
you
like
oranges
malty
fruit
bomb
this
is
i
didnt
expect
a
grand
cru
to
be
so
fruity
and
sweet
that
being
said
i
liked
it
could
use
some
more
complexities
definitely
a
sipper
good
price
for
a
750
for
nowadays
standards
fantastic
beer
this
one
had
sat
on
my
wants
list
for
awhile
but
id
never
gotten
around
to
pursuing
it
i
think
that
may
change
glad
to
have
tried
this
clear
honey
orange
pour
with
a
quickvanishing
head
sweet
aroma
of
oranges
and
pretty
heavy
malt
a
decent
amount
of
candied
seville
oranges
shine
through
which
is
kind
of
becoming
a
staple
of
some
southampton
brews
i
find
nice
big
juicy
flavors
but
pretty
sweet
and
just
a
thin
mouthfeel
some
creaminess
could
really
help
this
beer
more
pleasant
nuances
begin
to
unfold
toward
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
as
is
custom
with
southampton
delightful
floral
notes
play
with
the
candied
orange
kind
of
reminiscent
of
the
cuvee
des
fleurs
when
the
yeast
mixes
in
possibly
a
great
one
to
cellar
a
great
easy
to
drink
beer
to
start
the
night
also
a
great
attempt
at
a
belgian
not
very
often
does
a
belgian
get
nailed
by
an
american
notes
first
impression
wasnt
anything
spectacular
but
as
i
drink
this
and
it
warms
this
gets
more
and
more
interesting
would
like
to
sample
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
if
there
is
any
hop
bitterness
but
im
not
unhappy
at
all
about
having
cellared
this
one
for
quite
some
time
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
peel
coriander
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
orange
coriander
wheat
toffee
candisugar
and
caramel
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
was
very
nicely
balanced
very
well
made
and
flavorful
beer
overall
this
bottle
of
southampton
grand
cru
was
purchased
at
liquor
world
and
is
from
2004
after
a
heavy
pour
still
not
much
heading
but
color
is
nice
coming
out
dark
orange
many
particles
of
yeast
sediment
can
be
seen
as
well
the
nose
has
a
large
presence
of
mandarin
oranges
and
other
citrus
components
some
yeasty
character
and
honey
emerge
as
strong
smells
too
big
blast
of
honey
up
front
from
the
taste
followed
by
a
bit
of
that
citrus
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
sweet
to
the
point
that
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
mead
there
is
some
carbonation
there
to
help
the
drinkability
but
the
overall
sweetness
and
thick
body
can
make
this
one
difficult
to
have
a
lot
of
i
am
surprised
that
this
beer
shows
the
same
sorts
of
characteristics
that
it
did
when
i
had
it
fresh
it
is
worth
a
try
i
suppose
though
not
one
of
my
favorites
within
this
style
dont
drink
and
review
to
be
blunt
this
beer
is
pretty
unimpressive
it
tastes
good
but
the
blend
of
earthy
creamy
breadiness
and
harsh
spiciness
isnt
always
that
great
despite
how
nicely
restrained
the
added
spices
are
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
lackluster
especially
for
a
bspa
and
the
taste
itself
isnt
particularly
interesting
while
there
are
a
lot
of
good
flavors
and
aromas
here
none
of
it
is
done
particularly
well
i
would
pay
78
for
a
6pack
of
this
occasionally
but
i
cant
see
why
in
the
world
i
would
buy
another
750ml
bottle
with
so
many
better
belgian
style
ales
available
d
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
better
bspas
but
very
nice
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
ok
before
i
start
the
review
ill
just
say
wow
ive
been
sitting
on
a
bottle
for
awhile
and
never
bothered
to
try
this
for
no
particular
reason
after
my
first
sip
i
was
very
disappointed
i
dont
have
any
more
of
this
appearance
is
a
clear
deep
orangeamber
with
minimal
sediment
and
a
light
tanoff
white
head
that
settles
in
as
a
thick
crown
and
thin
film
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
a
delicate
balance
of
orange
peel
cream
vanilla
yeast
and
mild
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
resulting
in
an
overall
creamy
soft
texture
flavor
is
very
sweet
complex
and
rich
without
being
too
cloying
or
unappealing
the
sweet
ripe
fruit
candied
sugars
belgian
yeast
and
spice
balance
each
other
well
drinkability
is
incredible
i
went
into
this
expecting
another
run
of
the
mill
bspa
but
ended
up
very
impressed
with
this
unique
beer
bottle
from
the
free
table
at
woodshop

im

but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
a
three
year

banana
and

taste
is
full
of

with
a
slight

sophisticated
bittering
that
balances
the
broad
malt
sweetness
banana
and
clove
like
spiciness
that
evokes
wiess
without
the
wheat
twang
then
the
coriander
and
light
anise
takes
it
somewhere
deep
in
belgium
alcohol
is
well
integrated
but
gives
a
fusel
edge
introducing
the
yeast
tames
it
considerably
light
biscuit
in
the

finish
is
long
dominated
by
the

the

it
closed
feel
is
medium
weight
with
a
carbonation
that
leans
toward
crisp
and
effervescent
a
silky
suppleness
on
the
tongue
drinkability
start
out
good
and
seems
to
improve
as
the
alcohol
presence
fades
as
i
work
down
the
bottle
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
im
happy
to
have
had
the
experience
the
abv
is
very
apparent
at
the
end
but
thats
a
good
thing
drinkability
abv
holds
it
back
a
touch
but
thats
it
copper
in
color
and
cloudy
with
a
large
beige
head
high
carbonation
is
evident
and
the
head
retention
benefits
though
not
as
much
lacing
as
expected
the
nose
has
a
good
amount
of
butterscotch
and
belgian
malts
acidic
sour
cherries
and
plenty
of
other
fruity
esters
the
alcohol
is
evident
as
well
i
wasnt
too
appetized
by
the
scent
but
as
soon
as
this
hit
my
tongue
i
quickly
discovered
a
complex
and
tasty
brew
the
malts
and
fruits
that
seemed
more
separated
in
the
nose
come
together
very
nicely
with
a
moderate
amount
of
sourness
creating
tastes
of
dried
cherries
rum
raisins
candi
sugar
and
a
plentiful
amount
of
belgian
style
flora
and
phenols
the
finish
is
lightly
cookielike
with
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
and
ends
drier
than
it
would
seem
to
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
moderate
to
high
levels
of
natural
fine
carbonation
a
nice
beer
though
it
doesnt
really
tickle
my
personal
taste
drinkability
a
completely
transcendent
buzz
comes
from
this
beer
one
of
the
weirdest
and
euphoric
ive
ever
received
if
not
the
weirdest
and
euphoric
im
starting
to
think
wormwood
was
involved
in
this
or
something
but
wow
what
a
beer
one
of
those
experience
beers
without
having
to
be
something
completely
new
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
to
sit
because
weird
and
wild
things
will
certainly
be
going
on
as
the
beer
ages
get
a
bottle
large
bubbly
off
white
head
with
weak
retention
but
good
lacing
this
beer
pours
a
bright
pinkish
copper
that
looks
beautiful
when
held
to
a
light
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
very
fruity
and
sweet
i
hate
to
say
it
but
it
reminds
me
of
fruit
loops
and
lemon
drops
unexpected
amount
of
spice
in
the
flavor
the
nose
was
really
deceiving
lemon
zest
oranges
peaches
hint
of
ginger
and
black
pepper
a
little
boozy
and
some
nice
earthy
notes
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
around
and
sip
on
wrong
beer
for
tonight
still
very
good
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
mediumfull
with
a
healthy
dose
of
stingy
carbonation
this
is
one
odd
beer
very
impressive
that
all
these
unique
characteristics
blend
together
to
create
a
oneofakind
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
taking
sips
to
see
what
youll
find
next
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metalplastic
aspect
that
was
present
mostly
in
the
smell
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
drinkability
first
and
foremost
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
usually
the
american
version
of
these
brews
are
either
too
sweet
or
too
highly
spiced
hell
even
the
belgium
versions
of
belgiums
sometimes
are
too
sweet
or
too
spicy
this
brew
is
neither
and
is
quite
simply
tasty
as
hell
glad
i
let
this
be
for
over
2
years
because
its
drinking
freaking
spectacular
thanks
adam
d
decent
example
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
their
saison
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
too
buttery
and
onedimensional
d
very
drinkable
it
was
very
good
both
cold
and
at
cellar
temperature
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
copper
color
with
fluffy
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
oranges
and
lemon
zest
with
creamy
wild
yeast
and
a
variety
of
earthy
spices
including
nutmeg
vanilla
and
ginger
it
tasted
like
oranges
and
cream
with
lemon
zest
and
bready
yeast
and
some
nutmeg
and
ginger
and
coriander
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
mild
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
mellow
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
complex
and
delicate
beer
that
blended
many
tastes
and
scents
together
very
well
it
had
awesome
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
nicely
too
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
worth
taking
your
time
with
it
could
probably
improve
with
some
age
also
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
thats
unique
but
classic
d
gotta
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
but
if
you
are
its
an
excellent
beer
d
too
unique
and
palate
killing
for
long
term
fun
to
try
though
thanks

this
is

it
is
bar
none
the
best

belgian
that
ive

had
and
actually
probably
the
best
belgian
although
i
can
imagine
some

getting
even
better
with

the
beer
is
a
glowing
golden

with

the

and
flavor
are
both
very
complex
its
a
sweet

that
works

well
there
is
a

spice
of

is
a
blend
of
earthy

candied

despite
being
aware

was
happily

how
much
i
enjoyed

split
a
bottle
with
good
friends
and
i
wish
that
i
had
another
to
do
it
again
ship
to
california
southampton
please
note
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
past
but
just
realized
that
i
have
never
reviewed
it
until
now
thick
creamy
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
every
sip
brings
new
flavors
through
the

fantastic

that
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
at

above

really
opens
up
as
it
warms
d
i
havent
had
it
fresh

goddamn
is

sorry
guys
couldnt
even
finish
a
two
ounce
sample
overallgreat
beer
complex
fine
tasting
a
lot
of
flavors
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
great
great
beer
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
will
be
aging
one
to
drink
in
oh
5
years
or
so
d
good
tasting
interesting
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
overall
and
a
little
different
take
on
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
the
different
spicing
of
coriander
orange
peel
and
star
anise
basically
a
witbier
with
no
wheat
as
far
as
i
know
im
not
exactly
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
my
expectations
were
certainly
surpassed
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
style
beer
and
very
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
edit
had
this
again
with
in
a
short
time
messy
to
say
the
least
spices
were
all
over
the
place
and
an
alcoholic
taste
that
was
really
discomforting
much
harsher
then
the
first
time
thanks
to
drjay
for
sending
me
this
one
in
the
80s
bif
d
splitting
this
one
with
a
friend
was
just
fine
a
good
sipping
beer
but
definitely
not
one
to
session
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
id
be
interested
in
seeing
this
age
further
very
nice
offering
just
saw
that
alcohol
wasnt
mentioned
once
in
my
notes
from
a
few
weeks
back
thats
gotta
count
for
something
good
stuff
overall
waste
of
time
and
effort
had
my
sister
pick
this
up
for
me
in
new
york
on
her
way
down
to
nc
as
a
fan
of
duvel
i
had
to
try
this
and
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
did
comparatively
this
is
not
on
par
with
the
above
mentioned
beer
but
nontheless
this
is
a
strong
brew
i
particulary
like
the
flavor
combinations
and
the
fact
that
it
is
not
overwhelming
even
though
it
has
a
high
abv
good
beer
that
i
wish
was
available
down
here
hopefully
i
can
get
some
more
soon
would
like
to
try
other
offerings
from
southampton
d
this
was
one
of
the
best
ones
of
this
style
ive
had
even
my
wife
a
non
beer
drinker
enjoyed
its
complexity
regardless
of
the
high
abv
not
one
to
be
disposed
of
quickly
but
to
sip
and
smack
your
lips
to
all
night
long
this
type
of
beer
makes
me
put
pend
to
pad
asa
well
as
being
proud
of
american
craft
brewers
and
their
versions
of
belgian
classics
i
cannot
say
enough
about
how
good
this
beer
is
to
drink
picked
up
at
new
beer
in
nyc
drinkability
is
somewhat
impaired
by
the
booziness
that
comes
to
the
fore
as
this
one
warms
up
but
its
more
or
less
par
for
the
course
for
such
a
big
beer
big
thanks
to
derek
for
sharing

beast
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
this

treat
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
espcially
considering
a
fairly
high
abv
the
balance
and
complexity
make
sure
that
you
could
drink
this
all
night
my
initial
reservations
and
prejuidices
about
this
one
were
definitely
wrong
this
is
a
beer
i
will
surely
be
trying
again

on

in

store
for
a
long
time
so
it
may
not
have
been
a
prime
example
of
the
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
two
other

goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
highgravity
belgian
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
after
looking
for
a
bottle
of
this
for
some
time
i
was
definitely
thinking
this
would
not
meet
my
expectations
but
im
finishing
up
my
last
few
sips
and
ive
concluded
that
this
is
the
real
deal
just
superb
near
brewing
perfection
whats
not
to
love
about
this
one
very
little
perhaps
the
looks
just
okay
thats
about
it
this
is
one
tremendous
beer
even
if
youre
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
this
one
may
change
your
mind
flat
out
great
beer
im
so
stoked
ive
got
another
750
waiting
in
the
wings
but
not
for
tonight
not
just
yet
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
and
clean
easy
drinking
bspa
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
particularly
after
warmed
slightly
above
cellar
temperature
and
decanted
to
open
it
up
pleasant
balance
and
overall
flavor
make
it
easy
to
continue
to
sip
through
the
bottle
alcohol
and
richness
are
the
only
real
detractors
in
drinkability
though
not
enough
to
stop
craving
it
oily
after
dinner
sipper
non
existent
carbo
head
makes
brief
appearance
then
out
of
sight
possibly
due
to
the
oversized
wine
glass
strand
of
sweet
candy
sugar
introduces
dry
bitter
peel
herbal
and
medicinal
towards
the
center
hint
of
slight
tart
then
overun
by
a
complex
vacuum
of
booze
thats
suprisingly
well
hidden
an
amber
wine
with
several
components
to
its
character
didnt
do
me
right
though
sweet
soft
candyish
malt
flavors
up
front
herbal
grassy
hoppiness
on
the
edge
becomes
fruitier
with
notes
of
tropical
fruits
kiwi
pineapple
a
little
banana
and
melon
warming
peppery
alcohol
adds
to
the
complexity
mild
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
lingering
peppery
alcohol
and
residual
sugary
malt
very
nice
rocky
lively
carbonation
in
an
otherwise
creamy
full
body
a
wonderful
beer
m
full
rich
somewhat
velvety
a
very
good
carbonation
note
very
nicely
done
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
one
i
look
forward
to
getting
into
again
excellent
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
white
head
the
smell
i
get
is
of
cream
citrus
and
other
assorted
spices
i
can
not
peg
the
flavor
is
very
nice
of
a
well
crafter
well
balanced
beer
with
most
of
the
flavors
from
the
smell
intensified
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
it
seems
to
be
a
nicely
carbonated
beer
not
something
i
think
i
could
drink
all
night
but
certainly
something
i
would
like
for
special
occasions
which
i
did
this
was
the
beer
i
saved
to
drink
of
my
wedding
night
with
my
wedding
dinner
this
so
far
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
southampton
i
wasnt
that
impressed
at
first
but
it
continues
to
get
better
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
spiciness
and
warmth
set
this
apart
from
others
of
a
similar
style
but
as
i
drink
i
keep
wanting
more
and
more
this
is
actually
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
love
to
pick
up
more
of
very
complex
too
complex
for
words
ive
enjoyed
this
entire
big
bottle
an
outstanding
an
impressive
beer
superbly
balanced
tasty
attractive
this
beer
has
it
all
recommended
goes
well
with
fries
nice
big
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
love
it
and
go
on
into
my
hennepin
glass
pours
a
pale
but
rich
golden
color
with
a
very
nice
and
generous
offwhite
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
is
soft
and
plush
soft
fruity
and
floral
tones
the
taste
gets
a
bit
more
assertive
less
mysterious
yet
hard
to
qualify
i
could
tell
you
there
is
nice
orange
peel
corriander
and
anise
but
theyre
so
well
integrated
its
counterproductive
to
attempt
to
discern
them
the
body
isnt
too
light
or
heavy
the
alcohol
only
the
slightest
warmth
the
finest
of
carbonation
this
is
one
fine
brew
marvelous
the
finale
of
the
bif
race
2008
package
from
eyedrinkale
southampton
grand
cru
arrived
in
a
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bomber
when
poured
in
a
flute
the
head
occupied
more
than
half
the
glass
the
body
of
the
beer
was
clear
and
golden
to
orange
in
color
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
like
a
spice
cake
with
oranges
clove
rum
raisins
and
sherry
smells
the
taste
was
cake
like
as
well
because
of
the
sweet
bready
and
airy
malt
backbone
with
all
of
the
flavors
i
was
smelling
embedded
within
since
a
grand
cru
is
generally
served
at
weddings
the
cake
character
was
apropos
the
alcohol
provided
a
bitter
ethereal
drying
counterpoint
to
this
flavor
richly
textured
in
the
mouth
with
a
satiny
feel
unlike
the
pc
game
portal
this
cake
is
not
a
lie
d
cant
believe
i
finished
this
one
so
quickly
amazing
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
recommended
chalice
time
for
this
bad
boy
been
sitting
in
my
refrigerator
for
too
long
quarter
inch
head
fills
out
the
straw
color
medium
carbonation
smell
is
clove
lemon
zest
and
maple
the
maple
really
comes
through
in
the
mouth
with
candied
fruits
and
even
the
slight
touch
of
ginger
ale
it
got
me
thinking
and
then
researching
beers
made
with
maple
d
this
beer
was
complex
but
had
light
flavors
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweet
beginning
was
balanced
by
the
dry
finish
and
there
was
hints
of
funk
blending
with
complex
yeast
qualities
everything
about
this
beer
was
balanced
i
was
truly
a
wonderful
beer
a
dual
between
this
and
the
fin
du
monde
for
supremacy
in
my
book
a
really
fantastic
beer
ill
have
to
bury
the
next
one
another
very
impressive
southampton
you
can
smell
the
coriander
and
star
anise
right
away
it
looks
light
orange
with
a
paper
thin
head
smells
awesome
very
sweet
from
the
star
anise
and
coriander
a
nice
sweet
slightly
malty
flavor
of
the
above
mention
ingredients
full
mouthfeel
with
what
seems
to
be
a
little
extra
carbonation
very
active
carbonation
indeed
light
but
very
bubbly
fills
the
mouth
with
flavor
and
explodes
with
a
unique
sweetness
i
think
i
could
drink
this
wonderful
beer
all
damn
day
another
hit
from
southampton
although
it
is
very
sweet
kudos
750
ml
bottle
of
southampton
grand
cru
the
beer
pours
an
attractive
copper
color
with
an
inch
or
two
of
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
spice
coriander
at
least
and
also
some
citrus
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
sweet
and
fruity
apples
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
bang
of
spice
coriander
again
and
alcohol
a
little
thick
on
the
palate
for
this
style
the
sweetness
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
is
a
little
much
at
the
end
i
was
hoping
for
more
complexity
but
over
all
not
bad
complexity
dryness
hurts
the
drinkability
but
only
a
bit
this
would
right
at
home
in
belgium
well
done
southhampton
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
perhaps
a
little
sweeter
overall
than
i
would
like
a
bit
more
bitterness
or
drier
finish
would
have
been
nice
i
didnt
taste
much
of
the
spices
and
i
made
comparison
to
coriander
seeds
and
star
anise
i
had
on
hand
personally
im
glad
i
couldnt
distinguish
it
clearly
i
enjoyed
the
more
melded
flavors
while
i
would
enjoy
drinking
this
again
i
cant
say
i
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
hence
less
than
a
four
on
drinkability
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
enjoyed
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
southampton
and
it
was
not
bad
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
grand
crus
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
would
probably
age
very
well
would
drink
again
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
recommended
i
think
my
grand
cru
lost
some
carbonation
through
the
cork
because
it
lacked
it
almost
entirely
from
reading
the
other
reviewers
but
the
beer
is
still
quite
good
despite
it
the
beer
as
mentioned
is
a
coppery
orange
some
head
and
retention
the
smell
is
apple
coriander
sweet
malts
but
not
an
overly
strong
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
apple
coriander
with
a
sherry
like
consistency
but
it
lacks
some
of
the
yeasty
full
bodiedness
of
a
genuine
belgian
perhaps
because
the
carbonation
ran
out
the
beer
is
a
bit
syrupy
not
entirely
full
bodied
though
i
knocked
this
beer
down
a
few
points
because
of
the
overly
strong
alcohol
notes
in
the
finish
this
is
a
9
5
abv
that
tastes
even
stronger
i
tend
to
appreciate
when
the
throaty
alcohol
notes
are
more
subdued
or
hidden
behind
complex
tastes
not
so
here
this
is
a
good
beer
but
im
going
to
have
to
try
another
bottle
that
has
more
carbonation
and
perhaps
it
will
merit
a
rereview
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
spicy
beers
in
large
amounts
half
a
bottle
proved
just
right
d
while
not
the
biggest
fan
of
grand
cru
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
in
the
cellar
would
love
to
crack
another
one
open
during
the
summer
d
a
little
too
bitter
sweet
on
the
finish
not
my
favorite
style
so
no
harm
as
i
passed
off
my
glass
to
someone
more
appreciative
this
is
my
first
experience
from
southampton
and
i
will
certainly
be
back
do
not
go
into
this
expecting
a
duvel
and
you
will
enjoy
this
immensely
taste
mouthfeel
this
stuff
is
absolutely
packed
with
complex
fruit
flavors
orange
banana
mango
melon
and
pear
all
come
to
mind
spices
are
present
underneath
with
anise
and
coriander
shining
through
quite
strongly
syrupy
almost
cloying
sweetness
sticks
to
the
tongue
in
the
finish
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
a
hint
of
drying
alcohol
appears
in
the
finish
after
the
sweetness
subsides
at
the
time
of
this
review
the
grand
cru
is
the
1
rated
belgian
strong
pale
and
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
awesome
concoction
brewed
with
orange
peel
star
anise
and
coriander
750
ml
corkncrown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
and
labeled
as
9
8
the
beer
pours
a
sedimented
radiant
orange
hue
with
very
active
carbonation
and
three
inches
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
puts
loads
of
lacing
on
my
tulip
glass
it
has
an
irresistible
sugary
sweet
bouquet
fruity
and
peppery
with
oranges
pears
and
yeast
i
cant
stop
sniffing
this
beer
the
flavors
are
even
better
contributing
orange
peppery
coriander
hints
of
licorice
fruits
pear
melon
kumquat
stone
fruits
a
mild
to
medium
bitterness
and
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
even
the
mouthfeel
is
complex
the
medium
and
smooth
yet
prickly
body
imparts
coating
citrus
flavors
that
last
long
into
the
finish
final
thoughts
powerful
aromas
and
flavors
along
with
skilled
brewing
and
delicious
spicing
combine
to
provide
a
unique
damn
tasty
belgian
that
almost
comes
across
as
a
big
meaty
tripel
but
goes
down
so
very
easily
its
beers
like
this
that
prove
that
america
has
some
of
the
best
brewers
on
the
planet
the
booziness
spiciness
and
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
a
little
hard
to
consume
vigorously
nice
change
of
pace
beer
very
unique
indeed
i
think
i
might
try
it
again
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
truly
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
thick
texture
and
hefty
alcohol
content
limit
the
drinkability
and
this
is
best
enjoyed
slowly
during
a
lazy
sunday
at
least
for
me
poured
in
to
my
delirium
tremens
tulip
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
witha
a
sticky
whire
head
the
orange
peel
is
very
apparent
in
the
nose
pepper
and
sugar
are
also
upfront
the
flavor
is
just
the
opposite
the
peppery
coriander
and
sugars
used
are
very
upfront
with
a
sweeter
finish
pretty
robust
palate
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
pours
out
clear
orange
with
ruby
hints
and
a
thin
head
that
reduces
to
lace
but
sticks
around
the
rim
for
quite
some
time
nose
is
sweet
and
sour
with
barky
spices
clove
and
vague
citrus
aromas
a
bit
buttery
taste
is
coriander
and
yeast
with
nice
belgian
qualities
well
balanced
with
light
fruits
coming
through
bit
of
alcohol
and
more
spice
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
dense
dry
and
full
good
drinkability
a
complex
tasty
slowsipper
alcohol
slows
it
down
though
it
adds
warmth
without
interfering
in
the
taste
a
nice
anise
touch
adds
to
the
uniqueness
of
it
all
everything
blends
well
together
here
a
real
treat
pours
orange
to
golden
with
small
floating
sediment
a
puffy
white
head
foams
up
and
sticks
around
lengthily
smells
strong
and
spicy
and
yeasty
hints
of
oranges
and
coriander
orange
odor
is
tart
and
slightly
musty
taste
is
strong
and
tangy
orange
rind
and
yeast
spicy
malt
hints
of
alcohol
slight
burn
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
cottony
interesting
for
the
style
drinks
very
easily
smooth
and
impressive
thanks
very
much
to
pelican
for
trading
this
and
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
it
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
southampton
tastes
like
a
great
belgian
example
and
it
is
beautifully
balanced
fine
job
with
this
one
textbook
pour
dark
golden
with
an
excellent
head
that
sticks
around
little
lacing
the
aromas
are
nicely
balanced
with
candi
sugar
up
front
followed
by
banana
a
hint
of
clove
and
orange
zest
the
flavors
are
awesomely
balanced
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
in
the
glass
flavors
of
sweet
cani
sugar
clove
banana
coriander
sultanas
orange
cream
star
anise
and
the
tiniest
hit
of
peppery
spice
at
the
end
all
intermingle
seamlessly
really
beautiful
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
a
bit
sweet
amazing
drinkability
for
the
abv
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
its
drinking
well
right
now
and
is
not
at
all
hot
just
a
pleasure
i
recently
had
the
abbott
12
and
i
was
not
a
big
fan
but
oh
man
i
wish
i
had
about
a
dozen
more
of
this
one
a
nice
three
finger
off
white
head
grows
quickly
and
shows
nice
carbonation
upon
a
strong
pour
body
is
a
honey
amber
with
golden
tones
around
the
edges
solid
rocky
head
retention
and
lacing
as
it
fades
nose
is
a
perfect
array
of
banana
taffy
vanilla
mellon
and
spicey
wheat
wow
as
you
take
first
sip
you
quickly
come
to
realize
this
is
a
very
complex
brew
a
wonderful
mix
of
flavors
attack
the
palate
with
sweet
ripe
mellon
robust
spicey
wheat
and
hints
of
banana
and
back
round
hops
coean
and
crisp
while
being
bold
and
intriguing
alchol
is
scary
well
hidden
off
the
scale
drinkability
delecious
brew
that
deserves
respect
i
shared
the
bomber
with
my
soninlaw
but
could
have
cheerfully
finished
the
whole
thing
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
trying
again
well
carbonated
and
fairly
clean
finish
a
few
lingering
notes
of
tropical
fruits
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
orange
peel
and
star
anise
do
become
a
bit
too
much
after
half
a
bottle
thats
pretty
much
my
only
complaint
pours
a
slightly
clouded
gold
with
a
sizeable
white
head
that
falls
but
not
too
quickly
nose
is
heavy
with
a
yeast
influence
and
a
lemon
edge
flavor
is
tangy
and
sweet
when
it
is
colder
but
when
it
is
warmer
it
presents
a
spiced
strong
ale
the
spices
peek
out
much
more
than
the
tang
or
the
sugar
when
it
is
cold
feel
has
a
lot
of
bubble
on
the
mouth
but
a
thicker
liquid
feel
with
a
slightly
slimy
type
of
character
i
know
that
is
a
weird
word
to
use
but
to
me
that
is
what
it
is
it
is
not
syrupy
but
it
does
have
a
different
type
of
texture
to
the
fluid
overall
drinkability
is
high
its
a
bit
too
tangy
in
my
opinion
but
its
still
another
good
production
from
southampton

on
its
own
rich
w
no
more
spice
than
needed
very
traditional
in
flavor
w
new
world
touches
as
good
as
many
belgians
from
belgium
w
nuances
you
have
to
spend
time
w
this
ale
to
appreciate
deserving
of
its
place
among
the
greats
i
wouuld
say
5
given
the
surroundings
and
uniqueness
maybe
a
crumbly
cheese
on
toasted
pita
points
would
go
well
w
this
definitely
one
of
best
i
have
tasted
this
year
worthy
of
the
purchase
of
a
case
and
truly
worthy
of
its
high
rating
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
yeasty
with
some
crispness
in
the
finish
really
nice
higher
carbonation
helps
to
accentuate
the
complexities
rather
than
dull
them
lots
of
warmth
in
the
finish
well
done
throughout
an
excellent
selection
what
an
outstanding
beer
a
total
treat
2004
vintage
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
it
has
a
fine
effervescence
rising
in
it
there
was
a
small
offwhite
head
on
it
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
peppery
some
sweetness
coming
through
also
the
taste
is
quite
good
you
notice
a
slight
slickness
in
the
body
which
is
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
slightly
sweet
taste
with
notes
of
the
coriander
and
some
fruits
hint
of
alcohol
very
nice
poured
very
orange
a
little
flat
for
a
belgian
style
smelled
pretty
amazing
zesty
yeast
orange
and
coriander
definitely
come
through
tasted
great
too
really
complex
very
sweet
no
hops
to
speak
of
it
was
really
surprising
to
me
that
the
top
rated
belgian
strong
pale
ale
is
brewed
in
long
island
but
i
think
this
one
may
live
up
to
its
reputation
went
great
with
some
spicy
curry
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
its
complex
and
tasty
i
will
grab
a
few
of
these
when
i
get
the
next
chance
overall
fantastic
offering
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
too
syrupy
but
great
nonetheless
get
one
if
you
can
just
a
bit
cloying
just
a
bit
with
a
pop
of
medicine
alcohol
but
not
enough
to
bring
this
one
down
solid
brew
drinks
easily
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
irresistibly
creamy
perfect
carbonation
level
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
even
refreshing
at
the
same
time
with
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
this
2004
bottle
has
held
up
beautifully
simply
an
amazing
belgian
style
grand
cru
from
the
masters
at
southampton
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
vintage
well
worth
seeking
out
thanks
joe
tastes
like
a
burst
of
the
regular
spices
you
get
from
spiced
belgians
but
then
theres
this
absolutely
unparalleled
explosion
of
like
fifty
different
fruits
all
kicking
in
in
one
sudden
unexpected
and
exceptionally
smooth
burst
jesus
theres
every
single
fruit
you
can
imagine
in
here
apples
and
like
pomegranate
and
those
big
green
bananas
that
arent
quite
bananas
and
then
all
the
other
fruits
of
the
rainbow
cripes
the
bottom
line
is
this
grand
cru
is
awesome
the
more
i
drink
the
better
it
gets
went
great
with
pair
of
goudas
and
salamis
particularly
the
peppered
salami
and
candi
tasting
ewephoria
between
this
and
southamptons
saison
deluxe
theyve
got
some
of
the
best
belgian
beers
out
there
period
way
better
then
many
of
their
peers
on
either
side
of
the
pond
seek
and
enjoy
overall
this
beer
tastes
good
i
would
drink
it
again
of
i
had
the
chance
it
might
be
just
a
bit
too
syrupy
sweet
thank
you
himerman
for
this
beer
i
am
not
one
beer
closer
to
reviewing
all
the
top
100
beers
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
it
is
really
an
outstanding
beer
with
well
defined
complexity
that
is
extremely
interesting
to
a
beer
geek
it
is
also
so
well
made
that
i
was
able
to
give
this
to
non
beer
geeks
and
they
liked
as
much
as
i
overall
another
example
of
an
excellent
belgian
from
this
brewery
highly
recommend
d
a
tasty
brew
that
blends
the
spice
flavors
nicely
and
doesnt
come
off
as
spicy
as
i
expected
bottle
pours
redish
orange
the
white
head
quickly
fades
but
the
carbonation
remains
even
giving
it
a
slight
tingle
in
the
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
smells
of
sweet
fruity
belgiian
yeast
along
with
wonderful
spices
fill
the
nose
thru
the
tulip
that
i
poured
it
in
i
start
out
tasting
the
orange
sweetness
followed
by
the
spices
there
is
a
small
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
truly
an
execptional
ale
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
traces
of
lace
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
spicy
nose
flavor
has
a
lot
going
on
spices
malts
hints
of
alcohol
and
a
sweet
clean
finish
pricey
13
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
absolutely
fantastic
applying
for
a
mortgage
in
amazing
a
tip
of
my
glass
to
southampton
for
crafting
such
a
masterpiece
it
would
be
interesting
to
pair
this
with
a
fully
bloomed
creamy
bleu
but
my
gut
says
brie
or
cotswold
this
would
hold
up
well
with
anything
sweet
spicy
or
sweet
n
spicy
as
well
as
wild
game
just
a
phenomenal
beer
and
incredibly
enjoyable
i
cannot
recommend
this
highly
enough
a
true
classic
made
a
nice
pairing
with
some
aged
gruyere
it
so
great
to
have
great
belgianstyle
breweries
in
the
u
s
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
despite
the
lofty
price
tag
taste
is
too
sweet
upfront
some
fruit
and
malt
complexities
show
up
orange
apple
honey
caramel
toffee
maybe
some
cinnamon
if
you
look
hard
enough
but
this
beer
is
definitely
lacking
some
spice
imo
a
strong
tangy
sweetness
lingers
afterwards
which
is
a
little
too
much
of
a
good
thing
a
sipper
not
because
of
the
alcohol
but
rather
the
cloying
tangy
sweetness
still
a
good
complex
flavor
nice
delicate
carbonation
almost
perfect
for
the
style
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
i
dont
see
what
all
the
praise
is
about
malt
is
sweet
but
big
malt
is
cloying
so
there
you
have
it
but
it
works
because
it
has
to
be
thick
to
stand
up
to
everything
else
thats
going
on
complex
blended
and
artful
not
even
a
ballsy
abv
can
keep
this
from
drinking
like
a
dream
its
busy
but
like
a
bee
hive
with
a
real
sense
of
meaning
behind
all
the
activity
this
is
a
saucy
savory
meal
in
a
glass
and
it
makes
me
want
seconds
pours
a
clean
deep
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
nose
spicy
notes
with
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
dry
and
a
bit
spicy
but
a
nice
clean
end
it
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
clean
tasting
a
small
bit
of
a
spicy
aftertaste
a
very
nice
beer
but
be
worth
ageing
one
for
a
few
years
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
orange
in
color
with
a
medium
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
spicy
aroma
peppery
fruit
primarily
orange
also
present
great
flavor
sweet
orange
still
very
spicy
and
warming
maybe
some
licorice
flavor
late
very
nice
i
think
the
degree
of
spiciness
as
well
as
the
9
5
abv
limits
the
amount
one
would
drink
at
one
time
but
still
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
any
strong
belgian
styles
in
a
while
but
i
seriously
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
palate
melting
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
d
theres
something
special
about
this
one
fantastic
drinkability
abv
is
well
concealed
and
if
i
enjoyed
the
spiciness
this
would
be
a
great
drinker
unfortunately
this
beer
just
doesnt
match
my
palate
thats
not
to
say
that
it
isnt
a
very
good
beer
im
sure
for
some
if
not
most
people
it
is
for
me
however
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
was
a
good
one
to
try
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
i
could
see
why
you
would
like
this
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
tastes
and
came
off
a
bit
too
wine
like
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
as
it
is
a
more
than
decent
offering
that
is
obvious
that
alot
of
work
when
into
creating
a
very
fine
beer
from
southampton
appears
the
last
bottle
was
a
bit
too
old
this
years
was
nice
and
lively
pretty
much
along
the
same
lines
as
unibroue
11
or
edition
2004
nice
amounts
of
corriander
and
good
yeasty
flavor
didnt
really
blow
me
away
but
will
adjust
the
rating
accordingly
dont
age
this
one
wow
this
beer
really
impressed
me
and
i
can
in
fairly
skeptical
i
loved
the
balance
between
sweet
malt
and
uncommonly
assertive
bitterness
for
the
style
the
flavor
had
lemon
spice
and
funky
cheeselike
flavors
i
also
got
vanilla
orange
in
there
and
even
some
grape
in
the
initial
aroma
im
a
little
amazed
this
it
was
spendy
at
12
a
bottle
but
still
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
ever
had
damn
find
this
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
i
have
had
to
date
with
its
distinctive
appearance
sweet
aromatics
and
complex
flavor
palate
this
beer
exceeded
in
every
aspect
a
chest
full
of
the
alcohol
quite
drinkable
poured
into
a
chalice

nice
slightly
cloudy
dark

love
the
southampton
brews
so
far
highly
recommended
great
belgian
strong
pale
my
first
sh
offering
gives
me
a
great
impression
of
the
brewery
thanks
for
the
bottle
mymrngjckt
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
spicey
bouquet
which
contains
coriander
orange
peel
and
anise
although
i
dont
really
smell
the
anise
the
belgian
yeast
adds
a
beautiful
complexity
to
the
aroma
the
scent
is
fruity
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
in
it
as
well
the
taste
is
great
as
well
this
is
some
smooth
beer
especially
coming
in
at
9
5
abv
its
pale
in
the
malt
bill
and
fruity
in
the
finish
the
spices
round
out
the
taste
and
add
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
d
it
is
good
there
are
a
few
flaws
but
other
than
that
i
really
like
it
southampton
grand
cru
is
a
very
pleasant
ale
it
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
golden
color
while
there
was
no
hint
of
carbonation
when
the
cork
was
pulled
a
very
nice
large
head
forms
and
sticks
around
for
some
time
the
smell
is
richly
fruity
but
not
overbearing
the
taste
is
certainly
spicy
with
first
thoughts
being
of
lemon
and
grass
but
then
it
is
followed
up
with
a
nice
orange
peel
flavoring
a
very
nice
brew
worthy
of
picking
up
if
you
see
it
enjoy
md
easily
palatable
but
you
must
enjoy
beers
with
a
spice
to
them
chances
are
if
your
drinking
this
beerthen
you
do
a
well
brewed
beer
im
not
a
huge
grand
cru
fan
but
i
can
enjoy
a
good
one
which
this
is
d
im
shocked
and
totally
stunned
at
how
good
this
beer
is
yes
its
been
a
top
50
beer
for
a
while
but
most
of
those
beers
arent
this
good
this
beer
wasnt
even
on
my
radar
but
its
so
far
up
my
alley
i
feel
like
i
should
have
saw
it
coming
man
is
this
going
well
with
my
cajun
chicken
cheers
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
the
head
lasts
forever
and
great
lacing
this
is
a
very
good
looking
brew
the
smell
is
very
pungent
with
lemonclovesbanana
and
a
peppery
aroma
the
taste
is
crisp
hop
bitterness
and
a
blast
of
alcohol
the
normal
belgian
spices
are
present
along
with
candy
sugarcorriander
and
a
fruity
flavor
the
mf
is
medium
with
the
complex
flavors
mixing
well
this
is
a
first
class
beer
and
this
one
i
believe
would
be
even
better
with
a
year
or
two
of
cellaring
glowing
hazed
copper
appearance
with
massive
3
finger
head
foam
is
tan
and
made
up
of
large
soaplike
bubbles
being
fed
from
the
steady
carbonation
below
the
aroma
consists
of
a
fruity
coriander
spice
that
dominates
with
some
mild
floral
resins
and
potpurri
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
sugary
and
alcoholic
lots
of
fruity
malt
with
cinnamon
and
orangecitrus
notes
the
flavor
and
alcohol
border
on
becoming
too
strong
but
hold
back
just
enough
the
mouthfeel
is
not
thick
however
the
very
foamy
carbonation
creates
a
rich
mouthfeel
that
coats
pretty
well
this
is
a
solid
belgian
strong
perhaps
not
deep
enough
in
its
complexity
but
rich
and
tasty
nonetheless

i
was
more

if
i
was
this
beer
would
be
getting
some
5
ratings
this
beer
has
some
nice
complexities
to
it
it
tastes
like
a
malty
belgian
white
ale
beer
like
this
makes
me
glad
to
be
alive
this
is
one
of
the
best
bspas
that
ive
ever
had
no
matter
the
country
of
origin
sometimes
i
sit
and
marvel
at
the
complexity
in
each
mouthful
and
sometimes
i
simply
enjoy
whats
happening
to
my
taste
buds
its
only
january
but
its
going
to
be
hard
for
any
brewer
to
top
the
sheer
brilliance
of
southampton
grand
cru
during
the
remainder
of
2007
drinkability
good
fairly
light
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
but
that
doesnt
detract
theres
a
nice
mixture
of
spicy
and
hoppy
flavors
here
that
cant
be
completely
pinned
on
hops
or
spices
the
malt
serves
as
a
blank
canvas
for
the
interplay
of
these
other
flavors
but
is
substantial
enough
to
balance
the
beer
the
hop
character
is
prominent
but
with
soft
edges
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
ale
i
might
like
this
beer
more
if
the
spice
was
toned
down
perhaps
with
age
this
will
be
curbed
somewhat
a
full
750
was
too
much
to
take
at
once
perhaps
best
split
with
a
few
friends
it
would
make
for
an
interesting
sampling
i
will
say
it
was
well
done
and
quite
complex
but
its
really
not

abv
on
bottle
thanks
beerbeing
this
beer
pours
a
wonderfully
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
if
youre
not
careful
the
basic
smell
is
of
sour
yeast
and
a
mostly
zesty
presence
the
taste
is
terrific
with
tongue
that
is
congruent
with
that
of
a
tripel
but
less
assuming
i
would
call
it
mild
and
the
subtleties
are
what
make
it
stand
out
the
sour
yeast
taste
is
still
apparent
but
its
accompanied
by
an
almost
honeylike
sweetness
which
makes
it
incredibly
easy
while
going
down
there
are
also
spices
such
as
coriander
and
orange
that
are
easy
to
pick
out
the
finish
is
sweet
and
leaves
much
to
be
desired
but
of
course
this
subsides
when
the
next
gulp
goes
down
this
is
a
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
grand
cru
it
has
a
plethera
of
flavor
with
a
nice
aroma
but
the
carbonation
seems
high
plus
this
might
be
an
old
bottle
the
cork
broke
with
no
effort
pours
honey
orange
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
good
size
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
laces
fairly
heavily
aroma
is
strong
of
coriander
behind
this
there
is
a
delicate
sweetness
like
a
fresh
cream
that
mixes
with
the
orange
is
reminiscent
of
an
orange
pushup
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
strong
and
lingering
coriander
presence
with
a
nice
subtle
creamy
sweetness
to
balance
it
honey
and
oranges
there
is
some
alcohol
and
a
burnt
rubber
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
shows
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
although
it
is
quite
smooth
and
soft
thru
the
beginning
and
middle
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
for
nearly
10
but
warms
and
bites
just
the
right
amount
in
the
finish
very
much
like
a
strong
belgian
wit
easy
to
drink
a
750
even
at
this
strength
i
keep
coming
back
for
more
spices
are
well
balanced
by
the
soft
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
really
one
of
the
best
examples
of
its
style
i
have
ever
had
and
stands
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
rodenbacher
truth
be
told
i
think
i
prefer
the
southampton
beautiful
ambergold
colour
with
a
pillowy
white
head
aromas
are
of
plum
pear
honey
and
spices
taste
is
fruity
with
a
malty
and
yeasty
backbone
subtle
spices
fullbodied
feel
without
being
heavy
or
cloying
impeccable
balance
this
was
a
killer
choice
for
turkeyday
pours
a
hazy
amber
huge
thick
white
head
forms
tons
of
lace
all
over
head
never
leaves
very
sticky
smell
is
complex
sweet
and
spicy
yeast
apples
and
citrus
alcohol
reminds
me
of
the
allagash
yeast
strain
taste
is
sweet
citrus
yeast
and
spice
through
the
middle
apples
and
pears
in
the
finish
light
alcohol
pleasant
warming
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
dances
around
made
me
feel
good
definately
a
nice
belgian
style
thanks
for
sharing
grub
d
the
big
abv
is
limiting
as
the
ale
really
packs
a
wallop
but
the
depth
of
flavor
is
wonderful
it
definitely
could
use
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
this
beer
was
almost
unfathomably
spotless
quite
a
treat
thanks
again
russ
bottle
courtesy
of
hopdog
poured
an
orangey
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
orange
is
quite
intense
with
something
sweet
that
didnt
mix
very
well
with
the
beer
taste
is
like
a
mix
between
an
orange
crush
and
an
average
belgian
ale
and
was
not
really
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
the
flavour
doesnt
really
mix
well
and
body
was
quite
thin
i
was
expecting
to
be
impressed
by
this
beer
based
on
previous
rating
but
i
am
now
wondering
if
i
totally
missed
something
or
if
this
was
a
bad
bottle
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
worst
offerings
that
i
had
the
chance
to
try
form
this
usually
fine
brewery
drinkability
is
good
really
tasty
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
is
of
a
doughy
spicy
sugary
goodness
that
melds
into
a
medium
bodied
treat
bouncing
along
the
palate
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
too
drinkable
i
declare
it
illegal
believe
the
hype
still
all
in
all
quite
a
nice
brew
although
i
will
usually
be
able
to
find
other
brews
i
like
just
as
much
for
less
than
13
slightly
hazy
orangecaramel
colour
with
a
bit
of
rocky
nearly
white
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
skim
thick
solid
lace
with
decent
retention
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
distinctive
clove
spiciness
maybe
a
bit
of
pepper
and
anise
sweetness
in
the
flavour
really
brings
out
the
spiciness
coriander
and
anise
are
prominent
theres
a
light
orange
citrus
quality
as
well
light
alcohol
and
warmth
in
the
offdry
finish
full
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
light
side
making
it
seem
a
bit
heavy
very
nice
ill
be
putting
a
couple
bottles
of
this
away
to
see
how
it
ages
nose
is
is
a
miasma
of
scents
spicy
yeasts
caramelly
sweetness
light
fruitiness
some
mustiness
lurking
as
well
taste
starts
with
the
sweeteness
but
quickly
the
spices
seem
to
tickle
the
taste
buds
one
by
one
increasing
in
intensity
close
has
a
citrus
zest
to
it
and
a
light
alcohol
warmth
is
the
parting
blow
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
superb
this
recipe
hasnt
lost
anything
in
the
past
couple
batches
pours
a
musty
golden
orange
with
about
a
halfinch
of
offwhite
foam
moderate
retention
fine
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
banana
bread
and
clove
taste
is
similar
yeasty
banana
spiced
with
coriander
and
pepper
good
amount
of
carbonation
light
body
smooth
start
to
finish
moderate
drinkability
however
i
did
have
this
late
in
the
evening
so
its
difficult
to
judge
nothing
spectacular
stands
out
but
very
good
overall
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
definitly
one
to
take
your
time
and
enjoy
this
wouldnt
exactly
fit
with
any
food
specifically
but
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
bitter
cigar
on
a
nice
relaxing
evening
outside
near
a
fire
a
very
fine
offering
from
a
nice
brewer
im
glad
that
i
bought
this
bottle
in
the
past
id
had
some
negative
experiances
with
corks
from
southhampton
this
bottle
had
signs
of
slight
leakage
from
the
cork
but
did
not
exhibit
any
off
flavors
even
though
it
is
12
50
id
buy
it
agian
strange
note
the
front
label
says
it
was
brewed
and
bottled
in
royersford
pa
even
thought
the
back
label
states
brewery
and
restaurant
in
southampton
ny
guess
thats
why
its
becoming
more
widely
distributed
good
drinkability
but
it
is
a
sipper
with
its
high
but
well
masked
abv
and
reasonably
balanced
sweetness
this
was
really
pleasant
surprise
belgian
strong
pale
is
not
my
most
favorite
style
but
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
exceptional
deep
and
fruity
with
a
thunderous
sweetness
that
lingers
until
a
final
little
snap
of
hops
closes
every
sip
how
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
can
stay
with
you
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
your
evening
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
and
having
several
glasses
of
this
is
a
nobrainer
great
beer
here
overall
a
great
beer
though
a
little
green
imo
i
see
this
one
maturing
over
the
next
few
years
to
become
quite
a
fantastic
brew
once
all
these
components
meld
together
i
cant
wait
every
time
i
thought
there
was
something
that
was
bothersome
another
element
came
into
play
to
slap
it
down
or
build
it
up
probably
the
maltiest
version
of
this
style
ive
had
and
i
think
it
worked
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
for
its
complexity
and
while
its
a
nice
brew
the
9
5
precludes
a
higher
score
for
drinkability
overall
wow
an
excellent
belgian
ale
with
a
nice
strong
spicy
character
thats
balanced
well
by
bready
and
fruity
sweetness
this
pours
a
light
copper
color
slightly
orange
slightly
golden
very
clear
some
nice
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
smells
citrusy
zesty
and
some
definite
spicyness
in
there
very
hennepinlike
taste
is
also
citrusy
and
bready
and
again
spicy
too
spicy
overload
of
corriander
and
black
pepper
just
way
too
much
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
and
thin
for
the
alcohol
content
its
pretty
sneaky
but
its
too
sweet
and
way
too
spiced
up
and
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
unpleasant
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
it
still
disappoints
an
overwhelming
sweetness
in
the
flavor
with
notes
of
raisins
oranges
and
alcohol
gentle
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
smooth
feel
high
sweetness
and
alcohol
notes
limit
the
drinkability
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
definitely
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
pours
a
sparkling
dark
orange
that
leaves
a
bubbly
body
foggy
and
inviting
that
has
a
clingy
tan
head
the
nose
is
candied
orange
wheat
grass
lemon
peel
honey
tartness
fresh
spicy
hop
aroma
that
is
elegant
and
delightful
the
taste
starts
malty
candy
fruit
citrus
rind
bitterness
that
is
rounded
out
by
a
clean
palate
cleansing
from
the
carbonation
the
finish
is
bitter
and
slightly
boozy
but
that
alcohal
is
smooth
a
little
rough
but
it
is
quickly
offset
by
the
fruit
backbone
making
this
is
a
phenominal
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
having
overall
an
excellent
american
beer
in
a
belgian
style
the
alcoholic
hotness
does
not
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
i
got
from
this
beer
complex
tasty
a
winning
brew
no
question
about
it
id
love
to
see
how
this
tastes
in
5
years
750
ml
corked
bottle
the
beer
is
an
effervescent
and
slightly
cloudy
lightorange
colored
brew
topped
with
a
thick
and
puffy
white
head
this
is
a
brilliantly
attractive
brew
the
lacing
is
incredible
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
spice
and
yeast
theres
a
fresh
bread
quality
thats
expanded
on
by
orange
and
coriander
i
also
swear
that
i
can
smell
honey
apples
and
some
funky
yeasty
wildness
the
taste
is
equally
as
intriguing
it
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
followed
immediately
by
a
pleasant
alcohol
warming
and
the
spice
complexity
theres
a
quiet
caramel
and
roasted
grain
flavor
that
also
creeps
into
the
taste
that
seemed
to
be
missing
from
the
aroma
nice
spritzy
carbonation
at
first
because
of
the
carbonation
and
aroma
the
beer
gives
the
sensation
of
lightness
in
fact
this
is
a
quite
full
bodied
brew
it
dries
out
by
the
finish
which
is
flavorful
and
long
lasting
wonderful
i
nearly
finished
off
the
750ml
by
myself
before
i
had
dinner
and
i
also
thought
this
would
be
peer
to
my
favorite
on
draft
this
ones
amazingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
complexity
and
carbonation
fantastic
slightly
coarse
mouthfeel
this
ale
is
almost
saison
like
with
its
barnyard
funk
flavors
definitely
spiced
with
the
orange
and
anise
apparent
some
notes
of
hot
alcohol
are
present
midsip
with
faint
notes
of
nutty
sherry
finish
is
syrupy
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
and
a
drying
sensation
the
taste
from
the
last
3rd
of
the
bottle
was
still
sweet
n
sour
but
the
balance
was
much
improved
and
that
boosted
the
drinkablity
factor
as
well
i
definitely
would
try
this
one
again
a
refreshing
brew
but
it
seems
as
though
it
would
be
best
paired
with
something
beer
is
good
happy
big
belgian
style
beering
drinkability
not
more
than
a
couple
glasses
in
a
sitting
alcohol
and
sweetnesstartness
holds
you
back
i
am
not
quite
too
sure
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
but
it
is
quite
a
nice
end
to
an
christmas
day
of
overeating
and
stuffing
myself
this
beer
has
a
certain
richness
to
it
in
both
the
sweetness
and
the
earthy
spiciness
that
is
quite
nice
and
fulfilling
there
is
a
hint
of
tartness
to
this
beer
and
if
there
is
one
complaint
it
is
that
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
tartness
the
level
provided
by
some
aged
fantomes
would
be
classic
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
though
i
was
perhaps
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
and
depth
here
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
citrus
with
some
hints
of
sourness
interesting
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
tartness
as
well
as
a
lot
of
citrus
with
some
hints
of
the
alcohol
there
also
some
spices
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
moderate
as
well
the
tartness
detracts
in
my
opinion
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
like
most
southampthon
beers
it
has
a
very
different
and
unique
taste
at
9
5
abv
it
is
tough
to
have
more
then
2
of
these
believe
this
is
the
2004
vintage
pours
a
deep
coppery
color
with
a
light
patchy
head
nose
is
very
interesting
i
get
big
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
lots
of
orange
and
vanilla
notes
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
lot
better
in
my
opinion
i
would
guess
it
to
be
sweet
very
light
puff
of
alcohol
as
well
flavor
is
very
nice
and
tart
big
blast
of
lemon
with
a
thick
sugary
sweetness
behind
it
again
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
nice
and
thick
beer
here
almost
syrupy
no
real
carbonation
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
brew
very
happy
to
have
tried
it

is
a

with
apricots
banana
some

and
vanilla

evident
as
fruitiness
gives
over
to
a
some

white

full

with
a
spicysweet
finish
awesome
brew
cork
and
caged
bottle
that
came
to
me
as
part
of
a
fantastic
trade
with
twilight
after
the
cork
comes
out
with
a
little
persuasion
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownprange
color
head
is
very
small
but
good
retention
the
smell
only
reflects
what
the
flavor
confirms
that
this
beer
needs
age
the
orange
peel
and
spice
give
this
beer
a
although
not
unpleasent
sour
orange
juice
flavor
alcohol
is
very
noticable
goes
well
with
the
spices
this
beer
is
still
to
fresh
for
me
i
think
a
year
or
two
and
it
would
be
sublime
i
did
not
want
a
second
glass
of
this
get
some
mf
great
beer
deeply
flavored
and
rich
with
the
sweetness
and
coriander
almost
being
a
bit
too
much
for
my
taste
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
good
but
i
dont
know
about
grand
cru
im
also
kind
of
mystified
at
the
ratings
it
has
gotten
i
was
expecting
much
more
the
fact
that
it
is
so
sweet
combined
with
a
light
body
with
no
carbonation
is
kind
of
aggravating
its
good
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
i
thought
stonecrushers
review
was
perfect
when
he
said
that
this
is
definitely
a
complex
beer
with
a
bunch
of
flavor
but
none
of
them
really
all
that
delicous
this
seemed
similar
to
the
unibroue
10
to
me
but
i
felt
the
unibroue
was
better
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
i
would
argue
that
the
distinctness
of
the
fruity
elements
and
the
lingering
spiciness
offset
the
thin
mouthfeel
leading
to
only
moderately
drinkability
each
sip
is
packed
with
flavor
so
although
one
could
certainly
down
this
as
you
would
your
runofthemill
pale
ale
theres
certainly
no
good
reason
not
to
sip
this
as
you
would
any
big
beer
the
spiciness
triumphs
over
the
alcohol
masking
it
spectacularly
but
also
showcasing
the
warmth
of
its
background
presence
dont
listen
to
oldsock
hes
crazy
drinkability
and
notes

big
and
complex
but
still
relatively
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
belgian
style
ales
but
cannot
compare
to
the
many
fine
strong
pales
ales
made
in
belgium
or
many
of
the
offerings
from
unibroue
this
vintage
in
my
eyes
does
not
deserve
the
status
that
this
beer
has
received
taste
starts
off
very
candi
sugar
sweet
then
it
gets
even
sweeter
somehow
than
a
bit
salty
and
almost
peaty
a
splash
of
funk
gets
into
the
mix
alcohol
not
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
but
definately
feels
warm
and
fuzzy
in
my
gullet
it
blew
me
away
overall
wow
this
is
my
first
real
southampton
brew
outside
of
the
contractbrewed
new
bombers
and
its
easy
to
see
what
the
hype
is
all
about
this
is
just
an
incredible
beer
that
hits
on
every
level
damn
near
perfect
its
like
theres
a
party
in
my
mouth
and
everyones
invited
it
had
more
of
a
fruity
smell
than
id
prefer
but
the
taste
and
subsequent
intoxication
more
than
made
up
for
it
this
is
the
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
but
you
know
for
damn
sure
it
wont
be
the
last
i
drank
it
while
watching
the
kentucky
derby
i
figure
if
im
watching
the
sport
of
kings
i
might
as
well
drink
like
one
and
the
southampton
grand
cru
delivered
a
cloudy
dark
ambercopper
beer
with
no
head
appearance
reminded
me
of
hand
pressed
apple
cider
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
honey
and
fruit
notes
also
there
was
a
spicey
hop
presence
all
this
with
an
inviting
alcohol
background
there
was
a
honey
like
mouthfeel
the
flavor
a
fruit
sweetness
with
an
orange
peel
character
the
finish
had
a
nice
spicey
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
warm
in
the
tummmy
alcohol
goodby
overall
excellent
for
an
american
brewery
yum
yum
yum
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
have
a
feeling
id
have
a
very
rough
morning
if
i
did
this
beer
is
way
too
smooth
for
its
potency
this
is
the
first
southampton
brew
ive
had
and
im
definitely
impressed
so
far
this
poured
into
the
goblet
a
dark
cloudy
orange
with
a
decent
sized
fluffy
white
head
forming
on
top
minimal
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
as
the
head
died
down
aroma
is
full
of
fruity
esters
with
notes
of
apples
and
pears
over
a
variety
of
spices
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
yeast
round
out
the
smell
which
is
great
flavor
starts
off
with
fruity
apples
with
a
backing
of
spiciness
some
coriander
and
orange
peel
i
believe
notes
of
other
fruits
are
present
its
a
bit
sweet
and
tart
but
never
too
much
of
either
the
fruit
and
spice
carry
the
flavor
nicely
body
is
medium
effervescent
crisp
and
refreshing
i
can
hardly
believe
this
is
9
5
this
drinks
like
a
much
lighter
beer
and
is
so
damn
enjoyable
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
that
is
fresher
to
see
the
difference
i
believe
this
bottle
was
nearing
a
year
old
thanks
goes
to
steve
for
the
hook
up
super
many
thanks
and
good
wishes
for
an
amazing
christmas
time
trade
from
feloniusphil
for
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
orange
color
with
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
and
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
orange
citrus
and
musty
yeast
taste
was
very
nice
spicy
vanilla
oak
sweet
caramel
lots
of
citrus
fruits
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
supremely
impressive
and
highly
recommended
a
second
bottle
acquired
from
buffalo
the
first
was
from
poughkeepsie
was
completely
different
a
raging
sourness
obscured
the
sublte
creamy
richness
and
made
it
a
much
slower
drink
of
only
academic
interest
ive
changed
the
taste
score
to
reflect
the
combined
experiences
exceptional
beer
2003
surprising
grand
cru
with
bold

be
consumed
with

lots
of

also
the

aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
good
deal
of
ripe
fruit
and
spice
mmmmm
starts
with
a
bit
of
sour
musty
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
gives
way
to
tropical
fruits
and
exotic
spice
the
spice
is
perfectly
subtlecorriander
cardamon
cloves
some
spiced
beers
are
too
intense

with
an
unexpected
nip

this
was
the

i

comments

thanks
to
davo
for
sending
this
one
out
my
way
i
split
this
up
with
a
few
bas
at
the
first
annual
fright
night
extravaganza
pours
a
lightly
hazed
medium
amber
large
thick
offwhite
head
of
foam
settles
out
in
to
a
sheet
of
lace
that
stays
with
the
brew
smells
very
grassy
yeasty
and
citrusy
great
smelling
and
so
pretty
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
ive
never
been
to
belgium
but
this
fits
the
picture
in
my
mind
of
what
a
real
belgian
beer
should
taste
like
if
the
monks
brought
it
down
to
me
personally
the
lightest
most
delicate
malt
taste
passes
over
your
tounge
followed
by
a
slightly
tart
citrus
wave
of
lemon
and
orange
finishes
slightly
dry
without
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
however
my
head
knows
its
there
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
in
perfect
proportion
with
the
flavors
of
this
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
get
in
heaps
of
trouble
fast
this
is
a
must
drink
if
you
see
it
and
pass
it
up
its
your
loss
the
cork
did
not
burst
out
with
a
pop
as
i
thought
it
would
with
a
champagne
cork
the
cork
had
a
great
smell
of
pineapple
juice
bright
orange
color
with
tight
small
bubbles
and
a
wonderful
nose
of
pineapples
honey
and
a
yeasty
sweetness
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
rich
thick
and
oh
so
soft
and
creamy
the
alcohol
was
evident
but
does
not
overpower
the
great
tastes
the
spices
are
so
subtle
but
that
does
not
matter
this
has
to
be
the
best
american
belgianstyle
beer
got
it
at
the
american
beer
distributing
company
inc
in
brooklyn
light
copper
with
a
good
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
tart
with
a
hint
of
bandaids
this
is
also
a
pretty
herbal
and
earthy
aroma
the
slight
tartness
continues
into
the
flavor
along
with
a
good
bit
of
citrus
fruit
and
peach
turning
the
bandaids
into
something
pleasant
when
its
hard
to
imagine
them
being
such
overall
my
favorite
beer
from
southampton
bar
none
which
is
saying
a
lot
as
these
guys
keep
cranking
out
the
quality
brews
this
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
i
feel
it
is
the
equivalent
to
a
california
or
long
island
as
it
were
sparkling
wine
outclassing
anything
from
the
actual
champagne
region
of
france
hard
for
me
to
rate
a
beer
perfect
but
thanks
to
davo
2004
this
is
a
real
belgian
with
lots
of
intricate
and
definitive
spicinessorange
corriander
even
anisebut
unlike
most
of
the
strong
ales
there
something
understated
about
this
superb
delicate
brew
it
pours
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
a
fine
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
piney
and
the
taste
is
exquisitely
balanced
the
carbonation
is
smoothly
thin
and
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
mediummothfeel
this
is
one
lovely
offering
but
note
very
potent
though
you
would
not
notice
it
right
off
the
bat
appearnace
is
a
basic
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
head
that
leaves
patchy
lace
and
a
very
even
top
after
receding
smell
is
very
interesting
the
main
smell
is
a
cross
between
rubber
and
fresh
cut
live
wood
theres
also
a
small
grapy
smell
and
some
hop
hints
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
it
mellows
so
quickly
that
beyond
the
first
bit
of
sweet
it
is
quite
good
its
a
thick
taste
probably
because
its
got
so
much
alcohol
with
some
fruity
tastes
but
they
seem
dulled
down
by
a
meaty
salty
taste
too
interstingly
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
but
medium
in
body
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
this
stuff
is
a
monumental
acheivement
in
brewing
pours
a
serious
shade
of
golden
amber
shimmers
and
quakes
with
strength
and
vitality
a
strong
surge
of
flavor
boldness
and
complexity
greats
the
tongue
no
doubt
about
the
quality
of
this
lordly
creation
went
great
with
a
crab
cake
this
is
a
powerful
sipper
seek
this
one
out
and
savor
nice
looking
copper
appearance
capped
with
a
thick
frothy
dirty
white
head
retention
is
outstanding
lacing
is
moderate
and
droopy
in
form
co2
bubbles
stream
to
the
surface
at
a
moderate
to
somewhat
quick
pace
nice
nose
of
sweet
orange
must
bready
yeast
dry
corriander
and
hayfields
the
taste
follows
through
with
the
breadiness
and
sweet
orange
but
theres
also
a
great
spiciness
to
the
flavor
alcohol
spiciness
black
pepper
spiciness
corrianderlike
spiciness
alcohol
is
apparant
but
incorporated
nicely
into
the
overall
structure
of
this
beer
this
beer
has
the
type
of
bready
yeasty
flavor
that
i
love
in
belgian
style
beers
oh
yeah
this
ones
nice
a
strong
ale
of
nice
design
if
again
i
would
age
this
beer
less
to
aid
its
pungent
array
of
possible
complexities
regardless
this
drank
like
a
sweet
citrus
and
simple
pleaser
hard
pressed
to
think
of
many
better
ales
similar
to
it
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
thanks
to
herbjones
for
sharing
i
thorooughly
enjoyed
this
beer
opaque
golden
color
sweet
aroma
with
a
complex
fruity
flavors
on
the
tongue
in
my
opinion
it
was
absolutely
a
phenomenally
well
made
brew
it
was
luxurious
you
could
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
for
a
long
time
incredibly
drinkable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
call
in
your
favors
and
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
but
do
not
share
it
savor
it
all
yourself
this
wonderful
beer
was
a
lovely
clear
golden
colour
with
a
fluffy
big
white
head
the
aromas
were
sweet
and
consited
of
belgian
candi
sugar
yeast
various
types
of
roasted
malts
some
very
very
background
hops
fruit
spices
and
more
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
melange
of
spicy
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
malty
goodness
and
yeasty
abandonment
the
mouthfeel
was
very
fine
with
tiny
bubbles
gripping
to
the
surface
of
my
tongue
taking
each
and
every
tastebud
on
a
magical
carpetride
to
nevernever
land
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
grand
cru
and
many
other
breweries
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
this
brewery
that
is
churning
out
such
drinkable
versions
of
very
hardtoperfect
styles
the
east
coast
alesmith
perhaps
ill
have
to
try
some
more
of
their
brews
to
know
for
sure
but
for
now
i
am
glad
that
i
am
not
a
virgin
of
phil
markowskis
brews
anymore
its
a
peachy
golden
nectar
with
a
heavy
creamy
head
the
aroma
of
applesauce
spicy
yeasts
vanilla
and
an
abundance
of
other
spices
the
flavor
follows
along
with
an
incredible
sweet
fruit
flavor
peachespears
spicy
yeast
and
marshmellows
its
a
verrry
drinkable
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
the
flavors
are
hard
to
put
to
words
but
this
beer
is
not
hard
to
put
to
mouth
my
rec
is
go
get
this
beer
and
let
it
do
its
magic
a
most
impressive
brew
its
lush
flavors
are
delivered
within
a
perfect
mouthfeel
extremely
well
done
and
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
rivals
some
of
the
top
belgain
ales
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
phil
markowski
brew
i
wish
we
all
had
access
to
his
brews
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
find
and
well
worth
the
nearly
10
for
the
bottle
my
friend
geoff
who
does
not
like
most
of
the
beers
i
tried
said
he
would
drink
this
all
day
long
a
ringing
endorsment
in
my
world
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
drinking
high
abv
beer
i
have
come
across
and
this
solidifies
my
love
for
the
grand
cru
style
i
am
immediatly
going
to
go
back
and
buy
a
couple
more
and
cellar
them
for
the
rochester
winter
nice
funky
but
subtle
has
a
spicy
citrus
crispness
so
good
second
of
the
night
after
a
not
so
stoic
during
ravens

run

to
enjoy
more

not

going

beer
light
decent
balanced
but
not
quite
the
mouthful
of
flavor
i
was
expecting
o
the
description
on
the
bottle
made
this
beer
sound
interesting
which
it
was
however
i
detected
nothing
from
the
bourbon
barrel
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
beer
was
barrel
aged
nonetheless
it
is
a
good
beer
it
comes
across
as
a
saisonbspa
hybrid
it
is
absolutely
worth
a
try
local
species
definitely
has
some
strong
qualities
but
it
needs
some
fine
tuning
not
sure
what

mountain
is
getting
at
with
this
one
poured
from
a

medium
body
overall
a
very
good
beer
on
tap
at
sticks
and
stones
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
a
slight
hazed
deep
auburn
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
for
quite
awhile
carmael
and
dark
fruit
stood
out
most
in
the
nose
with
mild
phenols
and
vanilla
detected
as
well
somewaht
sweet
upfront
with
caramel
and
vanilla
flavors
with
lighter
than
expected
spiced
phenols
coming
into
play
with
a
decent
drying
toasted
oak
flavors
lingering
in
the
finish
the
barrel
doesnt
play
a
huge
role
in
this
either
does
the
phenolsmaybe
a
slightly
tame
version
of
the
stylestill
not
bad
o
very
enjoyable
beer
theres
a
lot
of
different
stuff
going
on
honestly
i
could
have
done
without
the
whole
bourbon
barrel
thing
here
overall
i
did
really
like
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
4
25
excellent
brew
and
a
fabulous
ipa
this
beer
makes
use
of
many
west
coast
us
hops
and
a
very
assertive
malt
that
forms
the
backbone
of
the
ipa
the
added
flavors
from
the
oak
barrels
push
everything
over
the
top
into
the
above
outstanding
category
well
worth
the
purchase
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
it
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
sweeter
belgian
pale
ale
quite
nice
overall
and
one
i
would
certainly
do
again
o
what
a
weird
ass
beer
i
like
how
unique
it
is
but
its
not
something
id
buy
regularly
there
are
a
lot
of
unique
and
complex
balances
between
a
saison
funk
and
barrel
aged
malty
ale
the
only
beer
i
could
ever
relate
to
this
would
be
fantôme
noir
but
this
is
a
lot
better
less
sweet
less
fruity
this
brew
is
labeled
correctly
experimental
sort
of
ale
yeah
weird
but
entertaining
for
your
taste
buds
and
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
honestly
the
flavor
seems
a
little
confused
its
not
solidly
belgianstyle
or
a
pale
ale
or
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
which
can
be
a
good
thing
when
the
flavors
come
together
but
they
really
dont
in
this
case
still
a
good
beer
but
sometimes
simpler
is
better
overall
overall
im
happy
with
the
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
just
a
little
more
beer
and
a
little
less
bourbon
this
same
beer
with
the
booze
dialed
back
about
25
would
be
absolutely
amazing
as
it
stands
the
branches
cant
support
all
the
decorations

o
nice
beer
overall
a
lot
of
meh
it
shows
some
promise
of
being
a
truly
interesting
brew
but
seems
to
fall
off
more
then
it
should
o
nothing
amazing
just
a
really
drinkable
bpa
with
a
mild
bourbonoak
presence
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
due
to
the
price
but
i
would
drink
it
again
with
no
problems
o
once
it
warmed
up
actually
tasted
like
a
pretty
nice
ipa
and
completely
drinkable
but
absolutely
no
belgian
or
oak
flavors
as
advertised
since
this
differs
from
most
other
reviewers
i
guess
i
got
a
bad
bottle
if
your
bottle
has
a
bestby
date
take
it
seriously
light
body
with
decent
soft
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
how
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
dominate
o
i
drank
this
glass
at
about
55
degrees
initially
and
liked
it
even
more
as
it
warmed
the
taste
grew
on
me
i
like
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
as
far
as
funky
belgians
go
i
think
its
pretty
on
par
and
the
yeast
really
does
remind
me
of
brewery
vivants
house
yeast
the
yeast
did
seem
just
a
little
overpowering
and
the
barrel
and
hop
aspects
didnt
show
up
as
much
as
i
thought
they
would
but
i
still
really
like
liked
the
flavors
and
i
thought
it
was
enjoyable
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
not
filling
crisp
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
drinking
the
whole
bottle
is
no
problem
and
if
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
bottles
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
how
all
the
aspects
were
equally
good
and
didnt
really
have
a
weak
point
the
only
thing
that
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
little
the
barrel
and
hops
showed
up
if
they
showed
up
a
little
more
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
have
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
i
might
grab
a
couple
more
next
time
im
at
boyne
country
provisions
its
a
little
pricey
but
i
think
its
worth
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
like
the
funkier
belgian
ales
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
really
what
i
expected
but
i
ended
up
enjoying
it
and
i
think
the
funkier
yeast
profile
worked
well
with
this
beer
this
made
for
a
good
first
impression
of
blue
mountain
brewery
i
didnt
see
any
of
their
other
beer
on
the
shelf
and
i
dont
know
much
about
this
brewery
but
if
i
saw
some
of
their
other
beers
im
pretty
sure
i
would
give
them
a
try
good
job
guys
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
beer
and
i
think
it
really
paid
off
ill
be
interested
to
see
how
this
changes
over
time
o
overall
sweetly
toasted
light
and
freshly
fruity
makes
this
drink
easier
then
it
looks
has
a
harmonous
blend
of
belgian
yeast
fresh
wet
fruitiness
and
american
spicy
hops
balanced
nicely
with
subtle
hints
of
charred
oak
woodiness
everything
is
delicately
balanced
and
fine
tuned
here
a
dark
looking
heavy
beer
that
really
does
drink
much
lighter
then
it
looks
crisp
and
refreshing
very
good
try
pours
a
humongous
three
finger
head
of
eggshell
white
to
tan
foam
dense
with
an
undulating
surface
excellent
retention
given
how
whipped
up
it
is
the
lacing
is
on
the
wispy
side
but
sticks
tenaciously
translucently
clear
like
vellum
coppery
base
that
turns
equally
brown
and
orange
very
few
bubbles
to
be
seen
the
nose
has
a
fresh
if
not
quite
clean
profile
stone
poor
dirt
pepper
and
dried
grapefruit
pulps
and
grains
the
hoppiness
sneaks
up
on
you
then
wham
the
apple
pear
peach
fruit
is
direct
and
underripe
like
you
wish
you
left
them
on
the
counter
for
just
another
day
or
two
no
meaningful
trace
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
mediumbodied
smooth
with
a
pleasingly
creamy
texture
even
the
underlying
sourness
cant
interfere
that
said
the
cherry
apricot
red
apple
pear
peach
fruit
sunny
and
tart
in
just
the
right
way
theres
an
earthy
leafy
element
but
not
thick
enough
to
be
like
sous
bois
or
deep
forest
in
character
mostly
orange
citrus
with
a
hint
of
lemon
clean
yeastiness
some
banana
spicy
without
any
one
spice
leaping
to
the
fore
harmonized
and
very
drinkable
probably
one
of
those
beers
best
not
categorized
just
enjoyed
nice
introduction
to
virginian
beer
lots
of
character
but
with
a
good
steady
hand
on
the
whacky
factor
i
feel
like
if
this
were
even
a
couple
of
abv
bigger
it
would
be
an
absolute
knockout
as
the
main
issue
here
is
the
oak
is
slightly
too
dominant
but
if
all
virginian
brews
are
like
this
i
look
forward
to
more
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
drinkable
brew
with
a
lot
going
for
it
if
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
with
the
palate
its
just
because
the
nose
was
so
wonderful
and
promised
so
much
but
its
still
very
good
stuff
rounded
integrated
and
complete
overall
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
strange
flavors
that
dont
seem
to
work
together
overall
interesting
beer
like
a
hybrid
really
mix
of
belgium
pale
farmhouse
and
barrel
aged
pale
ale
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
more
fruity
notes
come
out
good
beer
wish
the
barrel
oaked
flavors
were
more
present
but
overall
was
tasty
o
really
good
brew
and
impressive
what
has
been
done
with
the
flavors
yet
remains
a
relatively
low
abv
its
a
toasted
golden
with
a
solid
sheet
of
yellowed
cream
smells
of
light
belgian
yeast
apple
meat
some
bretty
character
caramel
malts
and
some
dried
cut
grass
flavor
is
malty
biscuits
some
oak
smoke
golden
raisin
seltzer
a
little
bitterness
and
some
metal
on
the
finish
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
silky
carb
and
a
near
bone
dry
finish
i
was
skeptical
of
this
beer
but
was
surprised
to
find
the
belgian
yeast
wasnt
too
overpowering
while
the
oak
was
a
nice
second
fiddle
with
this
beer
well
done
quite
interesting
and
pretty
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
imho
they
should
try
putting
this
in
12oz
bottles
and
sell
6ers
you
could
easily
make
your
way
thru
a
sixpack
over
a
nice
springsummer
evening
to
the
point
plain
old
uninspiring
it
was
drinkable
i
finished
the
whole
bottle
and
the
flavor
nor
the
mouthfeel
ever
changed
i
wont
buy
again

very

even
though
the
stated
barrel
aging
presence
was
minimal
it
wasnt
really
a
determining
factor
for
me
with
this
style
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
even
though
i
still
think
10
99
is
still
a
bit
higher
than
i
think
this
beer
ought
to
be
especially
considering
its
a
local
one
this
was
quite
tasty
and
even
better
than
i
expected
o
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
a
variety
of
tastes
not
normally
encountered
with
beer
id
like
to
find
the
story
behind
this
one
you
can
taste
a
bit
of
the
bourbon
but
damn
this
is
an
interesting
beer
strong
barley
malt
presence
up
front
with
an
faint
oaky
and
vanilla
flavor
from
the
wood
belgian
yeast
flavors
quickly
take
over
with
a
dried
chalkyness
and
horse
blanket
like
flavors
this
then
quickly
rolls
into
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
very
complex
and
layered
beer
very
faint
bourbon
notes
are
present
throughout
as
the
beer
warms
but
in
no
way
are
the
forefront
flavor
of
this
beer
allowing
a
lot
of
these
other
funky
and
complex
flavors
come
forward
extremely
complex
and
layered
with
flavors
that
somehow
roll
into
eachother
extremely
well
despite
how
different
they
are
super
unique
and
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
i
love
it
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
a
bit
dry
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
although
the
barrel
character
was
a
bit
more
muted
than
i
was
expecting
o
based
on
other
bas
reviews
i
think
my
bottle
has
developed
into
something
different
from
what
was
originally
there
regardless
i
thought
it
was
a
definite
winner
perfect
for
a
warm
spring
day
i
found
that
each
sip
invited
the
next
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
as
it
developed
on
my
palate
will
look
for
a
fresh
one
in
the
future
to
see
how
different
it
tastes
great
looking
beer
nose
is
nice
i
have
high
expectations
based
on
as
much
the
flavor
delivery
is
odd
at
first
i
thought
the
goal
was
a
flemish
tone
on
things
but
i
question
if
this
was
intentional
seems
to
be
off
with
an
aftertaste
that
is
off
putting
although
it
seems
to
get
better
as
time
goes
on
but
it
took
a
lot
of
time
a
lot
a
for
effort
c
at
best
for
execution

ov
on
the
whole
disappointed
with
this
brew
that
off
metallic
flavour
is
stronger
than
the
rest
and
i
thought
there
werent
enough
other
flavours
that
could
have
been
here
that
were
missing
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
sorry
to
say
o
interesting
beer
it
seems
like
an
unplanned
beer
that
is
a
beer
that
came
out
differently
than
expected
but
you
still
like
it
it
pretty
good
but
seems
unrefined
pours
darker
than
expected
a
deep
auburn
color
with
a
nice
tall
airy
head
that
deposits
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
subtle
aroma
perfumy
floral
apple
yeast
faint
wood
tastes
of
zesty
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
with
some
oak
leather
and
a
mineral
note
in
the
finish
light
malty
sweetness
and
a
raw
grassy
hoppiness
not
much
bourbon
to
be
found
other
than
a
hint
of
vanilla
medium
bodied
and
creamy
interesting
overall
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
but
i
am
not
overly
satisfied
with
the
end
result
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
sweet
given
all
the
other
things
going
on
the
cork
had
a
drink
by
march
date
on
it
so
i
guess
i
just
made
the
cut
off
it
had
a
slightly
oxidized
flavor
but
i
believe
it
helped
the
profile
a
bit
id
have
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
to
honestly
tell
nonetheless
this
is
a
pretty
solid
bpa
in
a
beautiful
bottle
id
love
to
try
more
from
this
place
d
this
was
a
really
impressive
brew
and
a
successful
attempt
at
bourbon
barrel
aging
a
light
belgian
ale
the
coconut
and
woody
aspects
perfectly
complemented
the
grassy
and
spicy
character
the
body
was
excellent
also
with
a
smooth
finish
probably
best
fresh
but
could
maybe
hold
up
for
a
few
years
recommended
o
i
will
give
this
beer
credit
for
being
different
the
flavors
sounded
different
but
after
tasting
this
beer
it
was
even
more
different
than
i
would
have
guessed
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
there
was
a
hugely
surprising
bretty
sourness
adding
the
bite
and
tartness
on
par
with
some
wilds
the
flavor
however
continued
this
excitement
only
mildly
that
sourness
does
work
its
way
to
the
buds
but
by
the
end
it
gets
washed
through
a
bit
by
pervasive
malty
background
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
tryor
two
label
says
aged

their

brookie
wheres
the
photos
ive
got
one
more
bottle
aging
a
year
or
two
might
negate
some
of
the
strangeness
but
as
the
label
says
its
an
experimental
sort
of
ale
this
beer
is
much
better
as
it
warms
i
tested
it
at
57
7
degrees
near
the
bottom
of
my
last
glass
and
it
still
had
some
of
the
musty
bitterness
i
described
before
if
i
tried
this
again
i
would
try
it
at
room
temperature
as
the
last
few
swallows
definitely
tasted
the
best
overall
though
blue
mountain
barrel

has
the
best

around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spices
wood
and
a
slight
bourbon
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
finish
and
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
overall
i
thought
this
had
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
but
the
finial
product
was
a
bit
strange
as
well
id
have
more
lighter
on
the
palate
than
expected
with
a
healthy
dose
of
bubbles
flavors
are
interesting
honey
is
predominant
with
light
burnt
caramel
and
subtle
summer
fruits
it
finishes
dry
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
oreally
not
a
terrible
beer
its
fairly
complex
yet
somehow
its
quite
boring
if
any
style
comes
to
mind
its
dark
belgian
ale
it
basically
just
tastes
like
an
american
red
ale
with
a
certain
but
slight
belgian
kick
its
okay
but
not
necessarily
worth
a
try
not
something
ill
be
getting
again
especially
for
the
price
tag
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
fun
to
try
but
not
one
id
want
to
buy
again
in
between
light
and
mid
somewhere
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
more
than
the
appearance
would
lead
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
with
some
uniqueness
added
o
i
was
really
expecting
more
bourbon
and
barrel
presence
in
the
beer
and
it
disappointed
in
that
respect
also
the
beer
has
some
interesting
components
but
it
just
does
not
feel
well
integrated
or
successful
when
put
together
o
a
very
interesting
beer
complex
and
fun
to
drink
the
yeast
subtle
hops
and
barrel
flavors
work
nicely
together
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
o
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
definitely
makes
this
the
finish
of
this
beer
a
little
more
interesting
but
it
seems
that
this
could
have
been
better
integrated
into
the
overall
taste
you
really
need
to
warm
this
beer
up
in
order
to
taste
the
bourbon
o
great
example
of
an
american
belgian
pale
ale
wtf
is
that
you
say
more
fullbodied
and
a
bit
more
complex
with
added
hop
punch
wellbalanced
and
fun
to
drink
should
pair
great
with
funky
blue
cheeses
spicy
foods
do
a
blind
taste
test
with
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
just
for
kicks
o
overall
a
weird
amalgamation
of
flavors
that
is
interesting
but
nit
necessarily
delicious
this
is
a
winner
overall
a
nicely
comple
and
unique
brew
this
is
a
must
try
for
the
beer
snob
the
aroma
differs
greatly
from
the
taste
but
compliants
each
other
well
d
very
nicely
done
with
a
subdued
but
spicy
yeast
character
and
a
really
well
played
additional
flavor
from
the
barrel
not
nearly
as
intense
or
crazy
as
the
description
on
the
bottle
would
imply
but
very
good
nonetheless
o
i
love
blue
mountains
beers
but
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
local
species
it
seems
like
a
maltforward
beer
should
carry
some
distinctive
malt
flavor
instead
the
barrel
characteristics
are
the
most
interesting
and
the
maltiness
is
dulled
i
would
not
go
back
to
this
one
i
am
going
to
hang
onto
the
other
bottle
i
bought
to
see
if
there
is
some
other
flavor
development
o
a
solid
beer
overall
thougb
the
chemicallike
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
it
has
noticeable
spice
and
sweetness
up
front
but
quickly
gives
way
to
more
bitter
hops
on
the
finish
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
more
apparent
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
flavor
profile
but
the
faintest
hints
of
vanilla
and
smoke
add
character
carbonation
was
slightly
aggressive
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
for
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
if
you
happen
to
live
in
va
local
trader
joes
outlets
have
picked
up
a
decent
chunk
of
blue
mountains
product
line
i
strongly
suggest
picking
some
up
if
you
happen
to
be
a
local
species
yourself
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
as
it
is
from
a
local
brewery
but
it
has
a
strange
aftertaste
that
i
dont
really
like
i
like
belgian
beers
and
i
like
ipas
but
not
this
particular
species
it
says
it
is
barrel
aged
and
i
usually
like
barrellaged
beer
but
it
almost
has
a
chalky
aftertaste
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
definitely
drinks
as
a
belgian
pale
but
the
hopping
adds
a
distinct
american
influence
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
adds
an
entirely
new
intriguing
dimension
good
initially
after
taste
is
not
good
o
melange
a
trois
is
a
really
unique
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
is
very
flavorful
and
aromatic
its
not
really
up
my
alley
so
to
speak
but
those
who
like
an
interesting
barrel
character
will
like
this
beer
a
lot
spendy
but
worth
it
for
a
chance
to
check
it
out
sharpness
in
the
beer
thanks
to
lively
carbonation
perk
up
the
backend
and
i
must
say
the
abv
is
hidden
o
this
really
works
a
complex
beer
that
crosses
many
stylistic
lines
an
orvalchardonnay
cocktail
with
a
squeeze
of
lemon
some
champagnelike
and
saisonlike
qualities

o
excellent
brew
this
one
is
up
there
in
my
top
20
beers
of
all
time
very
delicate
and
balanced
well
thought
up
well
put
together
brew
got
this
in
kansas
city
aug
9th
2014
and
drank
here
the
same
day
decent
notes
nice
complexity
a
good
winebeer
bridger
this
has
taken
on
a
lot
of
chardonnay
characteristics
well
rounded
unripened
fruit
character
with
a
oaky
and
buttery
lactic
acid
character
enjoyed
this
one
road
trip
this
is
a
huge
beer
certainly
all
of
the
10
percent
abv
its
listed
at
and
can
feel
like
a
whole
lot
more
in
high
doses
off
blonde
more
peach
colored
beer
with
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
and
just
a
bit
of
yeast
floating
about
tall
white
head
slowly
recedes
it
smells
like
belgian
yeast
all
the
way
mildy
spicy
extremely
grassy
and
with
the
acidity
of
the
wine
from
the
barrels
its
aged
in
complex
for
sure
with
notes
of
peppercorns
and
yellow
corn
on
the
front
end
tough
to
nail
down
grain
bill
because
of
these
unique
flavors
then
the
yeast
adds
an
orchard
fruit
element
maybe
green
pear
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
keeps
it
light
for
how
enormous
it
really
is
a
lot
of
beer
in
this
bottle
with
a
fair
bit
of
body
too
this
reminds
me
of
something
from
ommegang
or
unibroue
a
very
authentic
but
also
very
creative
take
on
belgian
beer
some
residual
sugar
very
fruity
in
the
finish
and
one
supremely
interesting
beer
everything
ive
had
from
nebraska
brewing
has
been
top
notch
i
had
no
idea
such
cool
beer
was
coming
out
of
there
before
these
ones
close
to
20
bucks
a
bottle
in
cost
for
this
reserve
series
stuff
but
its
darn
close
to
being
worth
it
these
are
one
of
a
kind
ales
here
poured
into
a
gouyasse
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
medium
golden
amber
with
a
beautiful
three
finger
fine
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
pleasant
aroma
of
white
wine
belgian
yeast
and
faint
oak
flavor
is
belgian
yeast
light
grape
apple
and
pear
juice
oak
influence
of
vanilla
and
butter
slight
tartness
belgian
and
earthy
spicing
absolutely
delicious
medium
bodied
with
great
creaminess
this
is
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
belgian
ales
ive
had
and
possibly
the
only
wine
barrel
aged
ale
that
i
totally
loved
im
a
big
fan
of
whiskey
barrel
aged
ales
but
wine
barrel
ales
are
often
too
tart
and
vinous
for
my
taste
the
belgian
ale
base
of
melange
a
trois
completely
supported
the
flavors
of
the
vinous
oak
and
incorporated
them
excellently
a
totally
enjoyable
ale
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seriously
contemplated
moving
to
nebraska
a
fine
production
overall
this
is
really
cracking
stuff
its
very
complex
but
blended
into
a
delicate
smoothness
that
belies
its
10
abv
this
is
a
really
exceptional
beer
m
medium
body
dry
light
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
earth
wine
wood
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
wine
and
earthy
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
wine
barrel
aged
presence
all
around
overall
despite
its
imperfections
this
beer
just
rubs
me
the
right
way
good
stuff
od
a
very
well
done
beer
the
chardonnay
comes
through
just
enough
to
add
complexity
its
a
big
beer
very
full
flavored
and
full
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
harsh
up
front
like
youre
dipping
your
tongue
into
a
glass
of
gasoline
yikes
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
develops
a
nice
character
definitely
getting
a
white
wine
feel
to
this
though
i
dont
drink
enough
wine
to
know
the
difference
in
styles
a
sourtartbitter
overall
feel
a
sweet
malt
backbone
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
its
hard
for
me
to
like
wine
barrel
aged
beers
since
like
i
already
said
i
dont
drinklike
wine
this
is
definitely
a
really
good
beer
though
pretty
darn
complex
for
a
blonde
ale
and
well
the
abv
doesnt
do
it
any
harm
a
medium
body
highly
carbonated
beer
very
booze
heavy
and
you
definitely
feel
your
chest
warming
up
throughout
the
glass
pours
a
clear
gold
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
there
is
some
suspended
sediment
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
wine
slight
dry
hop
hint
of
floral
and
slight
floral
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
the
dryness
level
is
not
too
strong
especially
for
a
wine
beer
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
floral
slight
wine
hint
of
pale
malt
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
great
appearance
good
aroma
body
and
blend
an
impressive
beer
no
doubt
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
as
all
nebraska
brewing
beers
seem
to
be
a
tulip
glass
of
this
was
12
at
tjs
in
any
event
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
though
i
was
more
than
a
bit
annoyed
when
i
saw
bombers
of
this
beer
at
my
local
mofc
priced
at
a
much
more
reasonable

a
pop
very
enjoyable
and
quite
interesting
going
into
this
one
with
high
hops

a
fairly

brewery

charge

a

pours
a

with
a
large

that
goes

rather
quickly
scent
is
spicy
at
first
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
some
pronounced
green
apples
and
pear
aromas
a
little
bit
of
french
oak
and
chardonnay
a
bit
of
lemon
as
well
nice
nose
to
this
beer
taste
is
just
as
nice
although
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
be
a
little
sour
taste
is
mildly
tart
green
apples
and
white
grapes
a
ton
of
crisp
belgian
yeast
flavor
spicy
as
well
more
spicy
than
i
was
anticipating
with
a
good
amount
of
pepper
and
lemon
zest
some
definite
french
oak
and
chardonnay
flavors
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
chardonnay
something
along
the
lines
of
a
less
sour
temptation
finishes
with
some
mild
hop
flavors
and
dry
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
dry
and
medium
bodied
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
burn
with
the
10abv
but
less
than
i
was
expecting
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
that
this
brewery
has
to
offer
unfortunately
i
may
not
take
the
risk
if
the
price
tags
are
this
high
it
took
me
3
trips
to
los
angeles
and
seeing
this
beer
on
shelves
before
i
actually
pulled
the
trigger
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
style
ale
it
has
fantastic
transitions
in
the
taste
with
all
being
very
smooth
and
pleasing
while
it
is
quite
tasty
for
the
price
it
is
a
bit
overrated
if
you
can
get
it
at
an
affordable
price
under
25
dollars
for
a
bottle
then
i
say
go
for
it
but
if
not
then
your
much
better
off
going
for
something
more
time
true
and
affordable
in
a
belgian
o
an
interesting
beer
very
good
use
of
the
chardonnay
barrels
although
its
still
pretty
drinkable
at
10
abv
its
still
a
sipper
i
picked
this
up
at
around
18
at
which
price
i
would
say
its
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
although
ive
seen
it
on
the
shelf
for
a
lot
more
in
some
places
this
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
it
had
a
really
nice
looking
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
was
decent
as
well
as
the
lacing
the
smell
was
up
oak
with
some
citrus
funk
and
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
tart
up
front
the
flavor
was
balanced
though
its
moderately
hoppy
tart
and
has
just
enough
malt
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
watered
down
there
is
a
crisp
carbonation
to
the
beer
and
very
drinkable
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
the
beer
appearsa
hazy
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
offers
citrus
wine
barrels
white
grapes
floral
notes
the
flavor
brings
grapes
and
white
wine
the
oak
character
is
there
but
light
alcohol
content
is
disguised
very
well
hard
to
believe
this
is
10
abv
other
than
just
the
slightest
warming
sensation
in
the
finish
overall
a
really
solid
beer
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
especially
with
the
price
tag
im
past
the
days
where
barrelaged
beers
impress
me
simply
because
theyre
barrelaged
sure
its
neat
but
so
what
doesnt
mean
its
good
melange
a
trois
however
is
a
truly
memorable
ingenious
and
exemplary
offering
that
makes
the
case
that
barrelaging
beer
can
be
an
art
form
the
melange
too
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected

this
is

better
for

with
most
all
of
the

very
well

it
started
with

like

that
quickly
melded
into
a

my
initial

to
this

was

s
its
very
very
good
not
perfect
for
a
belgian

pale
ale
it
could
have
a
bit
more

flavor
but
the
chardonnay
flavor
really
makes
this
beer
interesting
in
a
very
good
way
pricey
but
something
id
love
to
buy
again
to
share
with
friends
who
i
know
would
never

to
pick

this
amazing
beer
medium
bodied
creamy
well
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
00
abv
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
pick
this
up
in
hudson
and
will
look
for
more
nebraska
beers
when
i
go
back
very
interesting
beer
a
good
one
not
great
but
a
nice
take
on
a
blonde
the
wine
barrels
were
really
used
to
nice
effect
this
one
really
starts
to
open
up
as
it
warms
too
o
overall
an
interesting
belgian
style
ale
i
really
liked
the
wine
definitely
comes
through
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
would
like
to
have
again
a
fine
beer
thats
very
well
crafted
give
it
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
but
maybe
not
worth
seeking
out
pour
yields
a
bright
golden
brew
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
chardonnay
aging
is
really
apparent
in
the
nose
with
that
grape
varietal
being
the
dominant
characteristic
behind
that
is
a
bit
of
oak
and
accompanying
spice
plus
a
bit
of
light
fruit
taste
is
somewhat
tannic
and
brings
along
mild
spice
hints
of
oak
and
a
good
chardonnay
presence
good
feel
i
really
like
what
they
did
with
the
aging
here
i
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
of
the
base
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
good
and
was
very
close
to
breaking
into
the
realm
of
world
class
bspas
the
booziness
is
the
only
thing
that
holds
it
back
on
the
strength
of
two
outofthisworld
ales
im
ready
to
crown
nebraska
brewing
company
the
single
best
unknown
to
most
bas
brewery
in
the
country
melange
a
trois
is
at
least
the
equal
of
hop
god
and
might
even
be
better
both
are
superlative
drinkers
and
make
me
glad
to
live
in
a
neighboring
state
now
about
distribution
one
state
to
the
east
d
a
very
nice
bpa
the
barrels
give
it
a
unique
characteristic
that
i
really
enjoyed
as
a
pale
belgian
by
far
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
lighter
cloudy
body
with
a
moderate
head
neutral
aromas
above
average
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
gentle
masterful
blend
of
the
chardonnay
barrelling
taste
and
the
belgian
blonde
a
great
and
simple
idea
well
executed
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
well
put
together
pours
a
three
finger
tight
white
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
light
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
funky
sour
fruit
flavor
is
sweet
and
tart
fruit
not
finding
any
white
wine
flavors
high
abv
is
hidden
warming
good
but
not
worth
23
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
d
pretty
interesting
beer
all
around
the
chardonnay
aging
adds
a
little
something
extra
that
you
dont
typically
find
in
a
beer
i
have
like
everything
from
nebraska
brewing
that
i
have
had
so
far
i
do
like
this
but
not
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
reserve
series
still
very
much
worth
a
try
drinkability
good
di
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
this
beer
and
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
despite
the
high
alcohol
it
is
very
complex
and
drinkable
kudos
to
paul
and
tyson
at
nbc
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
there
reserve
series
in
the
near
distant
future
d
hell
yeah
exceedingly
drinkable
for
a
beer
dipping
its
toes
in
double
digit
abv
i
felt
like
the
alcohol
while
not
intrusive
in
the
least
became
apparent
as
it
came
up
to
temp
cheeks
were
feelin
the
heat
by
the
end
of
this
this
brew
begins
with
an
excessive
amount
of
head
but
is
not
gushing
its
hazy
goldenyellow
color
shimmers
perfectly
in
the
light
chardonnay
and
wood
are
obvious
in
the
nose
but
tropical
fruit
nougat
and
nutty
yeast
are
also
in
tow
it
is
silky
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
with
a
fluffy
moderatesize
body
with
a
little
tartness
it
is
still
very
beery
vinous
character
from
the
barrel
plays
strong
yet
mixes
well
with
the
malt
alcohol
and
modest
hops
tartness
and
wood
linger
long
into
the
aftertaste
pretty
damn
amazing
this
is
a
sipper
that
does
not
miss
a
beat
overall
very
outstanding
the
bottle
i
drank
is
their
2010
bottle
from
much
earlier
in
the
year
on
new
years
eve
i
had
the
latest
batch
and
their
was
a
strong
astringent
aftertaste
that
is
completely
absent
from
this
bottle
the
bottle
i
drank
is
a
masterpiece
of
complexity
and
balance
im
curious
if
my
additional
cellaring
allowed
the
beer
to
mellow
and
mature
than
the
fresh
sample
i
consumed
123110
bottle
at
the
december
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
dark
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
aromas
of
fleshy
white
stone
fruits
and
white
wine
also
some
woody
and
floral
notes
peachy
flavor
with
a
touch
of
oaky
butteriness
as
well
as
the
unmistakeable
chardonnay
character
these
guys
threw
a
lot
of
stuff
at
the
wall
for
this
beer
but
somehow
it
all
stuck
very
good
d
too
drinkable
this
stuff
goes
down
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
but
oh
so
smooth
and
well
balanced
forget
about
rr
temptation
this
is
the
best
pale
aged
in
oak
imo
d
sophisticated
completely
unique
a
stellar
offering
and
an
epic
introduction
to
nebraska
brewing
probably
nebraskas
second
greatest
offering
to
this
great
nation
after
311
this
is
worthy
of
always
being
on
hand
in
the
cellar
though
very
well
hidden
the
10
abv
keeps
this
from
being
slightly
more
drinkable
hv
flavor
is
also
great
medium
body
yet
crisp
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
lots
of
fruits
like
orange
and
banana
are
coming
to
my
attention
chardonnay
barrel
aging
was
a
wonderful
idea
for
this
belgian
blonde
ale
very
nice
characteristic
adding
a
nice
booze
warmth
down
to
throat
a
very
tasty
beer
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
pours
a
bright
yet
hazy
golden
orange
color
seems
to
have
some
yeast
particles
floating
about
beautiful
pure
white
head
the
left
a
sheet
of
foamy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
from
pale
malts
and
candi
sugar
which
is
quickly
followed
by
some
tart
lemonvanilla
oak
notes
from
the
aging
it
really
takes
on
the
chardonnay
character
some
pepper
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
of
a
sweet
pale
malt
sweet
from
the
candi
sugar
there
is
some
clovey
phenols
touch
of
banana
and
then
the
dry
white
grape
lemony
notes
solid
french
oak
flavors
lemon
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
this
gives
the
beer
a
nice
tartsour
edge
which
helps
balance
the
sweet
belgian
pale
ale
style
the
oak
is
more
subtle
in
the
flavor
which
works
quite
well
for
the
style
the
bspa
has
a
moderate
body
with
fairly
soft
carbontion
and
has
a
good
balance
between
sweet
and
tart
some
slight
abv
awareness
during
the
tasting
but
fairly
tame
for
10
an
interesting
brew
most
likely
well
received
by
the
sourtart
saison
lovers
out
there
the
chardonnay
barrel
aging
works
well
with
the
style
gives
it
a
nice
edge
moutfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
just
a
touch
on
the
sticky
side
for
me
the
drinkability
is
really
good
effervescent
and
a
little
peppery
slight
citrus
nice
esters
smooth
mouthfeel
great
color
and
clarity
head
is
foamy
and
effervescent
with
great
lacing
it
was
ok
taste
left
me
wanting
fruity
nose
cider
and
malt
pours
clear
straw
under
a
3
finely
bubbled
moussey
white
foam
cap
a
very
creamy
palate
with
fresh
fruit
evoking
a
cider
over
light
malts
in
the
background
fairly
dry
with
a
hop
accent
on
the
finish
its
effervescence
gives
it
a
light
and
refreshing
feel
on
tap
at
the
bruerys
tasting
room
poured
into
taster
hazy
yellow
with
white
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
that
remains
for
the
duration
aroma
is
grapefruit
bread
spices
some
pine
taste
is
early
light
grainy
sweetness
shifting
to
moderate
hop
bitterness
that
mixes
with
the
peppery
spice
and
lingers
light
to
medium
bodied
thin
texture
active
carbonation
dry
bitter
finish
this
was
an
amazing
brew
from
the
bruery
nice
bitter
feel
to
it
i
might
have
to
give
this
another
try
wasnt
digging
it
golden
and
hoppy
just
like
it
says
crisp
and
clean

cheers
very
closed
to
a
belgian
tripel
id
even
say
its
an
american
tripel
overall
a
good
balanced
pale
ale
that
puts
the
yeast
on
full
display
without
being
overpowering
with
every
beer
i
plan
to
review
i
open
it
roughly
10
minutes
before
pouring
the
first
sampling
of
it
many
reasons
for
this
but
my
main
purposes
are
to
let
it
breathe
or
aerate
slightly
as
well
as
giving
it
a
moment
to
sit
out
and
gain
a
few
degrees
in
temperature
i
wouldnt
usually
make
note
of
this
step
but
when
i
opened
this
beer
it
popped
louder
than
ive
ever
heard
any
beer
pop
in
my
existence
it
was
startling
to
say
the
least
shortly
after
a
pointy
cap
of
foam
has
since
grown
and
fallen
to
the
side
resembling
a
santahat
atop
its
750ml
throne
its
a
beautifully
clear
hazy
beer
if
that
makes
sense
with
far
less
carbonation
present
than
it
had
me
anticipating
laughing
to
myself
as
i
realize
20
minutes
have
passed
and
ive
merely
popped
the
cap
i
grabbed
the
beer
and
gently
poured
it
via
instructions
on
the
label
it
poured
light
dispensing
a
goldenyellow
but
the
head
is
so
incredibly
large
i
could
hardly
pour
what
i
consider
to
be
my
rough
standard
amount
it
grew
quickly
to
a
rocky
four
inches
and
dissipated
at
a
nice
slow
pace
with
a
little
spotty
lacing
left
in
its
wake
on
the
nose
is
a
beautiful
wheaty
lemon
aroma
with
a
very
slight
funk
amongst
some
bread
and
oranges
also
at
first
it
tastes
much
like
it
smells
and
is
extremely
light
on
the
palate
midway
through
more
fruitiness
arises
in
the
form
of
possibly
mango
as
well
as
bananas
regardless
a
mildly
tropical
element
is
presented
the
finish
is
crisp
and
contains
some
more
bread
leaving
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
at
first
but
the
effervescence
builds
as
it
fills
this
beer
out
somewhat
classic
in
style
its
an
almost
chic
brew
the
way
its
elements
are
fairly
delicate
even
in
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
not
to
take
away
from
the
beers
complexity

for

most

pear
followed
buy
a

of
earthyspicy
hops
that
perform
there
duty
by
balancing
out
the
fruity
taste
and
esters
given
off
by

the

does
give
off
a

this
one
comes
over
like
a
hopped
up
belgian
ipa
really
drinkable
cassanojoct

but
thats
the
only
part
of
the
beer
i
can
say
that
about
the
nose
is
absolutely
glorious
citrus
dry
hop
character
with
orange
first
off
bottle
exploded
after
uncorking
fun
to
drink
very
active
to
say
the
least
alcohol
is
well
hid
theres
something
in
the
bouquet
that
i
cant
quite
place
not
all
together
bad
but
cloyingly
sweet
at
times
and
hits
hard
with
those
bananay
esters
one
of
the
nicest
belgiums
from
belgium
to
me
sweet
sorta
sour
taste
with
a
nice
white
head
and
finishes
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
old
school
bubble
gum
taste
taste
of
crisp
apple
pear
honey
dry
finish
great
brew
overall
delicious
fresh
warming
and
almost
not
feeling
like
a
strong
beer
great
craft
has
a
fruity
nose
with
hints
of
compost
and
over
ripe
fruit
pours
hazy
straw
to
gold
under
a
pure
white
head
that
looks
like
a
washing
machine
gone
wild
strong
funky
flavors
of
old
plums
to
old
peaches
rich
light
malts
white
bread
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
finish
medium
full
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
biog
alcohol
but
it
is
not
hot
or
solventy
delicious
pink
elephants
always
satisfy
bitter
bitter
bitter
bitter
bitter
to
the
very
end
stronger
than

very
good
its
also
a
bit
light
and
possible

feel

tones
final
grade
4
41
an
awesome
a
grade
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
hype
about
delirium
tremens
prior
to
procuring
this
bottle
and
im
quite
happy
to
state
that
for
the
most
part
this
beer
has
lived
up
to
its
impressive
reputation
this
is
an
excellent
strong
belgian
pale
ale
one
that
can
be
expected
to
stand
up
and
compare
equally
or
even
favourably
to
most
of
the
other
big
names
in
this
style
all
fans
of
strong
belgianstyle
beers
should
consider
this
one
to
be
a
musthave
ill
definitely
be
keeping
a
couple
of
bottles
in
my
cellar
for
later
enjoyment
delicious
beer
i
read
a
review
calling
it
the
champagne
of
beer
i
must
agree
very
refreshing
tart
up
front
with
a
smooth
lingering
citrus
finish
poured
a
huge
fluffy
cloud
of
eggshell
white
head
good
retention
leaving
spotty
lacing
clear
and
golden
in
color
aromas
of
mostly
bananas
with
notes
of
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
aroma
matches
taste
very
well
adding
some
light
citrus
into
mix
long
lasting
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
low
in
carbonation
acidity
lingers
toward
front
of
tongue
for
a
short
while
the
higher
alcohol
is
disguised
well
making
this
sessionable
yet
on
the
pricey
side
still
worth
it
overall
a
wonderful
classic
belgian
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
highly
recommended
had
this
at
the
bar
it
wasnt
too
cold
and
it
shouldnt
be
i
went
out
and
bought
a
bottle
right
away
after
trying
it
pours
gold
with
a
thick
foamy
head
smooth
and
creamy
the
first
time
i
drank
this
beer
i
laughed
so
much
i
thought
it
might
be
laced
this
beer
is
great
if
you
want
to
have
a
good
time
very
fruity
wheat
taste
with
good
carbonation
and
delicious
after
taste
i
love
most
belgians
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
this
aromatic
goldencolored
belgian
is
among
my
alltime
favorite
beers
wondrously
fruity
fantastic
and
full
of
fine
yeast
goes
down
the
drain
with
ridiculously
ease
well
worth
the
aboveaverage
price
youll
likely
find
it
for
z
z
z
z
z
enjoyed
on
tap
at
craft
beer
market
this
was
to
me
the
champagne
of
beer
effervescent
and
bright
it
smelled
of
clove
and
pink
popcorn
i
found
the
taste
to
be
full
of
the
fruit
flavor
one
would
expect
from
belgian
yeast
dt
has
a
lively
mouthfeel
this
is
a
unique
beer
indeed
great
ale
only
thing
i
can
say
is
to
warn
someone
new
to
the
style
that
yeast
snow
while
unattractive
isnt
going
to
hurt
you
drink
up
very
fruity
grapefruit
citrus
and
orange
great
mouth
feel
with
a
mediumdry
finish
a
taste
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
overalldrinkability
quite
quaffable
for
a
belgian
gestaltbier
not
wasted
presentation
here
my
friends
overall
a
top
notch

shame
on
you
brouwerij

overall
this

it
a
beer

at

isnt
easy
to
come
across
poured
a
light
orange
with
overflowing
head
about
4in
that
was
my
fault
on
the
head
but
was
poured
into
a
belgian
ale
glass
tastes
a
carbonated
grapefruit
and
citrus
upfront
with
an
alcohol
end
super
solid
and
citrusy
fairly
light
but
a
great
complex
beer

to

quality
a
great
belgian
with
what
i
can
best
describe
as
champagne
like
qualitys
a
great
beer
for
almost
any
palate
biggest
gripe
its
obnoxiously
expensive
given
other
reviews
maybe
the
keg
wasnt
the
freshest
i
have
had
this
before
but
its
been
a
while
and
thought
it
more
fruity
than
what
i
tasted
today
will
have
to
revisit
a
a
b
b
b
this
poured
a
nice
slightly
hazy
golden
colour
with
a
thick
mousse
like
white
head
the
nose
had
some
grass
banana
yeast
and
a
bit
of
a
honey
edge
some
of
the
same
came
forward
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
but
it
finished
fairly
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
a
slight
carbonation
a
pretty
tasty
little
beer
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
i
love
to
drink
it
slowly
starting
cold
and
warming
up
the
flavors
change
with
the
temperature
negative
is
high
price
a
beautifully
put
together
fruity
arrangement
i
picked
up
light
fruits
and
an
almost
bubble
gum
taste
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fun
beer
pours
a
very
light
gold
slightly
cloudy
estery
slightly
fruity
aroma
upon
first
taste
hints
of
starburstjolly
rancher
came
through
light
carbonation
a
very
tasty
beer
to
say
the
least
this
is
a
beer
that
provides
the
notes
of
cloves
and
bananas
that
you
would
expect
from
many
belgium
beers
it
is
tasty
not
terribly
filling
and
a
great
beer
to
start
or
end
the
night
with
it
was
painful
to
drink
in
my
opinion

this
beer
as
opened
my
eyes
to
the
whole

of
beer
such
a
smooth
flavor
with

peppery
aftertaste
i
recommend
eating
with
pulled
pork
or
a
juicy
burger
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
anything
from
delirium
is
good
but
the
original
is
the
best
and
i
just
love
those

and
dancing

this
beer
is
quite
good
i
love
both
their

and

beers
with
a
nice
blend

flavours
wife
loves
it
o
for
a
big
brew
this
is
sooo
easy

i
dont

the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
the
score

still

either
too
tangy
on

it
sits
just
right

in
the

of
the

will
be
soon
to
follow

to
anyone
who
enjoys

this
just
happens
to
be

the
most
drinkable

i
was
expecting

like
a
session
ale
but
dont
underestimate
it

well
yeehaw
this
beer
is
great
wonderfully
wellrounded
and
the
flavour
notes
were
so
uniqueyet
worked
so
well
togetherand
were
very
pronounced
peach
banana
pink
peppercorn
and
spearmint
this
bouquet
is
effusive
and
will
definitely
have
you
seeing
pink
elephants
which
were
quite
charming
on
the
glass
i
do
not
understand
the
fascination
with
this
beer
made
me
rethink
home
brewing
they
have
made
this
into
an
art
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
so
successful
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
high
alcohol
content
very
good
belgian
beer
grab
it
off
the
shelf
if
youve
never
had
it
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
93
ive
never
really
tasted
a
beer
that
did
anything
quite
like
that
and
i
think
this
is
worth
seeking
out
soley
to
experience
it
a
beer
whos
prime
virtue
is
its
mouthfeel
is
really
a
remarkable
thing
pours
a
light
straw
color
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
and
leaves
no
lacing
behind
on
the
nose
some
lemon
and
green
apple
with
a
grassy
undertone
on
the
palate
a
dry
mix
of
citrus
bitterness
and
malt
more
of
that
green
apple
on
the
swallow
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
this
one
o
this
is
not
my
style
dont
like
strong
beers
without
strong
aromas
side
note
usa
lost
to
belgium
just
a
few
days
ago
in
the
world
cup
so
part
of
me
feels
like
im
betraying
my
country
drinking
belgian
ale
this
week
but
not
that
big
of
a
part
great
beer
comes
first
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
bubbly
head
that
stays
for
a
whole
eventually
settling
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
smells
of
yeast
fruit
and
white
pepper
taste
of
apple
and
pear
with
a
smooth
creaminess
light
and
crisp
mouth
with
a
great
balance
of
carbonation
the
flavors
expand
as
it
warms
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
is
perfect
for
the
summer
months
nice
to
revisit
this
wellbuilt
classic
brew
it
starts
refreshing
and
builds
complexity
overtime
so
according
to
your
drinking
pace
you
choose
what
type
of
beer
to
drink
this
is
definitely
better
than
its
competitor
the
regular
duvel
but
a
bit
overpriced
o
great
belgian
strong
and
flavorful
anyway
its
a
shame
that
1
these
bottles
duvel
included
cost
as
much
as
they
do
and
2
no
u
s
brewery
seems
to
be
able
to
quite
match
the
cleanliness
and
bone
dryness
of
dt
and
duvel
when
producing
an
homage
to
these
beers
the
style
this
beer
is
very
different
in
the
bottle
compared
to
on
draft
at
least
where
and
when
ive
had
it
on
draft
unless
the
tap
line
is
calibrated
perfectly
the
bottle
is
the
way
to
go
with
dt
not
that
youd
want
to
drink
it
often
theres
plenty
more
belgian
brews
out
there
with
more
to
offer
this
to
me
is
just
a
fancilypackaged
malt
liquor
equivalent
still
something
id
hook
up
with
now
and
then
o
the
fruity
tinges
make
this
an
interesting
beer
but
i
did
find
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
tarty
only
my
second
belgian
ale
and
a
fun
experience
a
pale
clear
straw
color
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
complex
spice
and
herb
notes
notably
mild
clove
and
a
hint
of
grain
one
of
the
best
jobs
of
masking
a
high
alcohol
content
i
have
experienced
our
table
of
four
agreed
that
the
beer
seemed
very
light
and
drinkable
the
feel
is
not
too
thin
and
overall
this
is
very
nicely
balanced
o
a
nice
bspa
that
would
definitely
be
called
a
sipper
i
think
id
need
to
revisit
this
one
in
a
while
to
give
it
another
whirl
and
see
if
it
comes
out
the
same
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
classic
offering
of
this
style
but
its
not
as
tasty
as
duvel
nor
as
complex
as
stille
nacht
at
this
price
point
i
expected
a
bit
more
there
are
other
beers
in
this
style
i
want
to
try
so
i
doubt
i
will
be
returning
to
this
one
for
a
while
still
very
glad
i
tried
it
and
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
appearance
is
a
clear
light
straw
color
this
offering
had
a
half
finger
of
clear
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
had
the
classic
belgian
funkiness
the
belgian
yeast
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
nicely
semidry
i
enjoyed
this
but
found
it
to
be
less
than
satisfying
for
such
a
high
price
though
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beers
fruityyeast
aroma
the
flavor
was
fantastic
this
beer
has
a
very
full
bodied
slightly
hoppy
bitter
flavor
followed
by
citrus
and
malty
aftertaste
i
was
shocked
to
find
the
alcohol
flavor
of
this
beer
to
be
more
of
an
undertone
rather
than
the
commanding
flavor
id
expect
from
a
8
5
beer
a
beautiful
pour
into
a
snifter
this
head
isnt
going
anywhere
and
i
absolutely
love
that
in
a
beer
some
nice
lacing
as
well
belgian
ales
are
not
my
usual
goto
beer
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
the
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
you
could
tell
me
this
puppy
is
2
and
id
believe
you
overall
its
a
great
beer
i
like
the
overpowering
sweetness
its
something
i
can
appreciate
with
food
or
by
itself
what
can
i
say
about
a
beer
that
is
named
after
a
medical
condition
that
happens
to
alcoholics
after
withdrawing
its
great
beer
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
world
but
is
marginal
good
compared
to
other
belgium
strong
ales
it
is
definately
a
hipster
beer
it
pours
bright
gold
has
a
petite
head
that
sticks
around
a
little
bit
and
stable
body
average
carbonation
it
has
a
natural
taste
of
grasses
malts
hops
earth
and
sweetness
with
the
yeast
taste
running
major
interference
it
has
an
edge
to
its
tast
becuase
of
the
8
5
abv
it
has
malty
aftertaste
and
is
a
filling
beer
overall
i
like
it
not
my
normal
type
of
beer
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
at
8
5
abv
its
a
keeper
the
champagne
of
beer
this
beer
is
just
like
champagne
in
the
best
ways
the
color
is
light
yellow
with
a
creamy
head
the
best
word
for
this
beer
is
effervescent
you
can
feel
the
bubbles
in
your
nose
as
you
take
a
sip
upon
giving
a
sniff
the
smell
of
apples
and
pears
came
through
the
taste
is
light
yet
filling
with
a
bunch
of
citrus
from
the
belgian
wheat
loved
this
beer
and
would
totally
recommend
o
not
my
first
time
with
this
beer
and
glad
i
could
finally
review
it
it
is
one
that
i
often
use
as
a
beginner
for
my
night
or
with
dinner
it
is
less
a
dessert
beer
but
pairs
well
with
cheese
crackers
and
other
hors
doveurs
this
beer
is
one
of
my
personal
top
25s
exceptional
8
5
with
no
perception
of
alcohol
citrusy
and
peppery
this
is
one
tremendous
beer
i
put
it
in
freezer
for
14
minutes
before
drinking
the
head
is
huge
light
golden
color
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
ever
buzz
was
top
notch
with
no
hangover
food
match
lsd
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
for
the
price
give
me
duvel
tasty
i
think
ill
have
some
more
tonight
with
beerbattered
fish
and
chips
a
great
beer
and
a
style
that
i
am
gravitating
towards
as
the
warm
months
approach
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
encountered
that
is
a
little
hot
a
noticeable
amount
of
high
abv
o
you
never
know
what
youre
gonna
get
with
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
pretty
open
to
interpretation
but
this
one
was
really
nice
overall
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
very
long
time
and
forgot
how
great
it
was
truly
one
of
the
great
belgians
that
is
widely
available
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
more
often
wow
absolutely
fantastic
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
this
you
must
delirium

45
overall
overall
this
beer
has
surpassed
most
of
my
expectations
and
will
go
down
as
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
in
color
a
good
1finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
very
thing
white
layer
that
is
mostly
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
not
much
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
malts
and
sweet
light
fruits
the
taste
of
malts
with
lemon
hits
your
tongue
first
followed
it
a
slight
sweet
but
tangy
finish
just
a
slight
bitter
finish
was
noted
but
didnt
linger
too
long
taste
starts
with
light
pear
then
moves
to
belgian
yeast
and
spice
with
a
tart
apple
alcohol
finish
yeasty
dry
tart
alcohol
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
very
high
carbonation
a
bit
of
graininess
warming
smooth
with
a
drying
aspect
slight
bit
of
cleaning
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
maybe
a
touch
more
carbonation
is
a
bit
rough
almost
fizzy
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
a
fine
brew
but
the
nocturum
is
better
overall
every
time
i
try
this
beer
out
it
gets
better
and
better
o
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
floralfruity
beer
without
the
artificial
taste
its
good
but
not
complex
or
anything
one
can
do
much
better
in
the
style
get
you
some
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
its
citrus
bouquet
and
champagne
like
bubbling
carbonation
flows
throughout
the
beer
due
to
the
bubbling
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
light
the
finishing
bitter
is
reminiscent
of
citrus
zest
have
had
the
tremens
before
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
must
say
that
the
pour
from
tap
in
brussels
was
damn
good
it
held
up
to
my
expectations
as
a
representation
of
a
strong
belgian
style
it
is
what
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
has
never
experienced
a
strong
belgian
style
ale
i
sampled
several
of
the
other
delirium
brews
but
i
must
say
that
the
tremens
was
my
favorite
overall
this
is
okay
but
the
finish
wasnt
all
that
spectacular
gets
a
little
too
astringent
as
time
passes
and
the
flavor
becomes
a
little
bland
decent
but
not
my
top
choice
in
the
style
oa
beer
that
has
to
be
tried
one
will
come
back
to
it
here
and
there
for
some
its
a
favorite
beer
tremens
may
be
the
best
quality
affordable
nonwhale
belgian
strong

ale
along
with
goose
islands
matilda
there
is
better
in
the
style
though
that
drinkers
will
seek
out
i
wish
the
head
was
better
because
the
body
color
is
truly
as
if
the
sun
was
squeezed
into
your
glass
smells
great
tastes
great
feels
like
a
sticky
champagne
drink
it
rich
deep
golden
colored
with
a
thin
head
of
foam
that
does
not
cover
more
than
half
of
the
top
loads
of
carbonation
bubbles
very
apparent
that
this
is
not
a
filtered
brew
as
there
are
some
pretty
good
sized
floaties
in
here
i
get
biscuity
malt
and
belgian
yeast
the
mouth
is
fairly
carbonated
but
dry
flavor
is
crisp
and
you
get
a
bit
of
sweetness
reminiscent
green
apple
and
some
gentle
tartness
in
the
fade
from
the
belgian

delirium
tremens
from
huyghe
brewery
is
a
belgian
golden
from
the
part
of
belgium
known
as
flanders
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
appearance
that
is
very
inviting
the
smell
has
so
many
citrusy
and
beautiful
aromas
that
give
such
a
strong
draw
to
this
beer
delirium
tremens
also
a
wellknown
international
name
that
commands
respect
but
in
comparison
with
other
breweries
of
belgium
in
the
southern
french
speaking
region
of
the
same
style
this
beer
maybe
able
to
stand
its
ground
but
is
just
simply
not
as
tasty
as
its
southern
cousins
the
taste
is
alright
good
but
not
the
best
for
belgium
blonde
lovers
and
the
mouth
feel
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
would
say
the
beer
is
still
advanced
for
the
belgium
blonde
drinker
and
is
also
a
must
try
as
despite
the
taste
ratings
in
comparison
to
all
beer
styles
and
belguim
blondes
from
other
countries
delirium
tremens
is
a
great
beer
i
just
choose
to
compare
the
beer
with
others
of
the
same
style
inside
their
country
o
this
is
a
great
belgian
ale
where
dubbels
are
big
and
bold
this
is
equally
well
made
but
180
degrees
opposite
o
yeah
this
was
great
as
i
had
expected
it
to
be
the
ceramic
colored
bottle
it
sweet
too
its
a
fairly
expensive
bottle
but
its
well
worth
it
this
was
incredible
o
not
a
fan
of
the
feeling
of
this
one
the
taste
is
pretty
good
but
it
does
have
that
alcohol
bite
to
it
would
be
better
if
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
smoother
loved
the
huge
yeast
notes
in
the
smell
a
quite
nice
an
impressive
looking
bspa
certainly
on
par
with
the
other
fine
examples
this
had
notes
of
pine
floral
cleaner
and
a
balanced
yeasty
profile
would
have
it
again
maybe
the
second
best
known
belgian
strong
pale
after
duvel
fairly
easy
to
track
down
and
worth
trying
on
tap
as
well
as
from
the
bottle
dts
pours
a
nice
lemon
drop
yellow
pretty
clear
and
sparking
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
head
that
nevetheless
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
compelling
blend
of
dusty
spicy
yeast
sweet
fruits
and
an
interesting
funk
or
horse
blanket
note
almost
like
an
old
library
full
of
musty
tomes
not
brett
per
se
but
you
are
definitely
sniffing
something
full
of
interesting
esters
palate
is
sweet
sour
and
bitter
all
rolled
together
a
rich
honey
malt
sweetness
coupled
with
cardamom
and
coriander
spice
notes
like
a
yellow
curry
and
some
orange
rind
apple
and
pear
fruit
to
round
out
the
corners
a
bit
and
provide
added
juicy
complexity
reasonably
chewy
and
thicker
than
a
tripel
but
still
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
with
some
hops
cleansing
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
obfuscated
its
almost
not
there
i
actually
prefer
this
to
duvel
itself
a
classic
the
additional
spice
is
nice
i
dont
really
get
what
the
hype
is
with
this
beer
sure
it
tastes
like
a
typical
belgian
if
you
can
get
around
the
massive
alcohol
taste
its
so
uninhibited
that
id
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
ive
had
15
abv
brews
that
are
smoother
than
this
its
cloying
distracting
and
out
of
place
the
mouthfeel
is
too
syrupy
and
thick
and
it
allows
the
alcohol
to
cling
to
your
taste
buds
and
distract
you
from
further
sips
if
you
want
a
pretty
or
fragrant
beer
you
could
do
worse
but
in
taste
i
cant
recommend
no
reason
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
this
o
give
me
duvel
every
day
of
the
week
but
theres
nothing
dreadfully
wrong
with
this
beer
its
just
a
bit
too
heavyhanded
with
alcohol
presence
for
me
i
have
a
tough
time
finding
fault
with
this
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
recommended
to
anyone
who
loves
belgian
beer
overall
very
delicious
brew
something
i
was
extremely
surprised
to
find
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
although
the
tap
selection
was
small
but
sophisticated
anyway
a
treat
for
anyone
who
loves
beer
and
especially
belgian
beer
prost
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
only
duvel
would
be
a
clearly
superior
example
while
others
could
be
aromatic
and
texturally
magnificent
this
beer
gets
better
each
time
you
try
it
like
most
if
not
all
beers
it
is
better
on
tap
so
if
you
get
a
chance
to
have
it
at
a
bar
go
for
it
orange
and
applelike
flavors
give
way
to
a
strong
sense
of
cloves
i
would
also
recommend
the
other
varieties
from
this
brewery
second
review
this
time
on
tap
this
is
still
the
most
perfect
beer
ever
made
o
this
one
starts
of
unimpressively
but
quickly
proves
itself
a
fine
example
of
the
belgian
style
ill
be
having
more
tomorrow
night
o
1920
great
beer
m
thick
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
full
finish
very
sweet
bottled
in
2012
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pales
so
far
a
classic
probably
my
favorite
for
the
style
i
do
like
some
of
the
drier
examples
of
belgium
pales
but
delirium
is
such
a
complex
and
flavorful
brew
it
always
hits
the
spot
o
i
have
had
been
trying
some
good
belgian
strong
ales
lately
and
i
have
not
been
disappointed
i
enjoyed
this
overall
very
good
strong
ale
worth
seeking
out
by
the
way
i
am
not
a
beer
connoisseur
but
someone
who
is
trying
to
learn
to
appreciate
the
finer
beers
o
the
delirium
beers
are
bottled
in
this
iconic
ceramiclooking
bottle
a
painted
brown
bottle
that
does
a
fantastic
job
of
keeping
any
light
out
perfect
for
extended
aging
the
problem
with
the
bottle
though
is
that
it
makes
it
impossible
to
see
any
sediment
lying
in
wait
and
the
delirium
beers
always
seem
to
be
chockfull
of
it
rushing
into
your
glass
with
even
the
most
gentle
pour
chunky
floaties
aside
delirium
tremens
embodies
the
belgian
strong
golden
ale
style
fragrant
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
ready
to
knock
one
on
their
ass
if
theyre
not
careful
my
friend
and
i
both
said
wow
after
the
first
taste
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
the
citrus
notes
or
the
carbonation
but
it
was
an
impressive
entrance
its
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
but
it
is
very
good
the
soapy
looking
head
was
a
disappointment
but
overall
a
pretty
impressive
beer
o
great
balance
of
complexity
and
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
certainly
drink
it
again
again
i
had
it
from
the
bottle
so
this
review
has
some
bias
o
overall
the
beer
is
great
looks
great
smells
great
and
tastes
even
better
its
a
really
light
and
flavorful
beer
that
everyone
should
try
overall
a
superior
experience
this
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
head
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
those
little
floaties
in
it
the
aroma
is
full
of
yeast
citrus
and
banana
the
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
and
delivers
a
smooth
complex
flavor
that
is
fullbodied
and
delicious
another
delicious
belgian
beer
that
is
pretty
readily
available
this
is
my
not
much
of
a
drinker
wifes
favorite
beer
i
found
it
once
in
chicago
for
her
then
years
later
it
became
accessible
locally
the
price
is
salty
enough
to
give
one
hypertension
twenty
bones
for
a
four
pack
cripes
ive
drank
one
in
my
life
and
it
tasted
like
bitter
wine
i
guess
when
my
wife
drinks
she
doesnt
funk
around
a
beer
too
rich
for
me
in
a
couple
ways
o
a
very
good
beer
with
high
alcohol
content
that
is
not
perceived
boozy
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
like
it
i
dont
know
if
its
quite
deserving
of
some
of
the
high
ratings
ive
seen
but
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
fairly
good
taste
definitely
worth
trying
its
just
not
really
my
thing
o
you
know
youre
in
for
a
unique
beer
when
the
bottle
is
creamcolored
with
speckles
i
can
tell
that
theres
quality
behind
this
beer
and
that
some
may
even
consider
it
a
favorite
but
it
wasnt
for
me
the
crisp
appearance
is
extremely
enticing
and
the
smell
and
first
wave
of
flavors
is
very
pleasant
but
the
aftertaste
and
high
carbonation
didnt
suit
me
well
like
i
said
i
know
that
this
beer
is
a
good
brew
well
suited
to
the
style
and
to
the
palates
of
some
which
is
why
i
bumped
up
my
overall
score
higher
than
the
individual
categories
would
calculate
out
to
but
overall
it
just
isnt
for
me
the
taste
has
an
upfront
sweetness
with
a
nod
toward
honey
sweetness
and
some
subtle
and
mild
hops
to
finish
with
a
low
hop
bitterness
i
liked
it
very
much
overall
a
beer
that
is
one
of
kind
in
its
flavors
loved
it
and
wasnt
at
all
what
i
expected
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
great
anytime
of
year
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
picked
this
up
on
close
out
at
the
super
market
and
it
seems
likely
delirium
tremens
really
shouldnt
be
aged
this
long
i
rarely
drink
delirium
tremens
and
this
tasting
has
reminded
me
why
it
really
is
the
sam
adams
of
belgian
beer
its
available
so
widely
its
not
a
treat
to
find
it
and
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
beer
this
style
there
are
much
better
choices
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
great
beer
but
there
are
far
better
beers
available
nearly
as
widely
for
the
genre
and
perhaps
at
less
expense
drinking
it
the
flavor
works
its
way
from
the
nose
to
the
back
of
the
throat
taste
starts
out
on
a
malty
note
as
it
works
down
to
the
throat
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
character
of
the
belgian
yeast
comes
through
strong
carbonation
a
beer
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
drink
cold
and
at
a
good
pace
to
avoid
it
getting
warm
fairly
refreshing
beer
that
does
not
stick
on
palate
overall
wow
every
time
that
i
have
this
beer
i
just
love
it
more
and
more
the
way
this
beer
refreshes
is
just
amazing
if
you
like
belgium
beers
and
havent
had
delirium
tremens
you
need
to
on
a
funny
side
note
delirium
tremens
is
actually
an
alcohol
withdraw
symptom
that
includes
severe
shaking
interesting
name
for
this
amazing
beer
o
going
from
appearance
to
overall
this
beer
gets
progressively
better
while
the
overall
score
was
brought
down
by
the
smell
and
appearance
the
taste
is
outstanding
if
taste
were
the
only
thing
this
beer
is
outstanding
as
an
added
note
the
opaque
gray
and
black
speckled
bottle
really
builds
suspense
as
youre
getting
ready
to
pop
the
top
and
pour
ive
never
been
more
excited
to
pour
a
beer
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
i
havent
had
a
delirium
tremens
in
many
years
and
i
remember
thinking
it
wasnt
anything
special
back
then
but
442
reviews
later
this
one
does
really
measure
up
quality
but
a
bit
visually
disturbing
o
4
overall
its
your
basic
tripel
nothing
special
but
yknow
well
done
o
a
good
but
not
a
extraordinary
beer
anyway
it

deer
lord
please
drink
this
out
of
a
tulip

and
pair
it
with
a
basil
and
beef
thai
chili
dish
additionally
be
sure
to
order
it
from
a
stored
bottle
and
not
a
tap
system
a
lot
of
bars
carry
it
and
not
everyone
knows
how
to
serve
store
or
attach
the
tremens
keg
properly
trust
the
hands
of
the
belgians
overall
enjoyable
again
nothing
extraordinarily
special
in
my
opinion
very
lively
and
hoppy
feel
and
some
very
nice
light
fruit
notes
this
one
is
very
well
carbonated
and
looks
great
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
one
and
the
beer
is
an
easy
one
to
drink
o
good
beer
i
like
this
style
and
this
beer
is
pretty
good
there
are
many
others
that
i
enjoy
more
but
i
might
return
to
this
beer
in
the
future
great
bspa
wish
it
hadnt
been
this
long
between
visits
outstanding
beer
good
carbonation
beautiful
head
cool
bottle
and
surprising
complexity
i
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
before
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
quite
famous
and
i
was
really
impressed
would
drink
again
would
seek
out
o
not
overly
complex
what
you
smell
is
what
you
taste
its
a
good
beer
flavorwise
but
not
quite
smooth
enough
to
keep
me
wanting
to
come
back
still
think
this
is
a
great
beer
great
belgian
esters
not
cloying
with
a
long
flavor
profile
its
a
little
hot
and
carbonation
is
higher
than
i
prefer
but
great
estery
flavor
o
top
notch
bspa
i
think
im
seeing
pink
elephants
super
balanced
flavors
that
really
combine
to
create
a
treat
for
your
mouth
this
is
a
masterpiece
that
really
massages
the
palate
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
cheers
overall
tasty
nice
herbal
taste
nothing
really
distinguishing
about
it
though
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
this
was
one
of
the
first
high
gravity
craft
beers
i
ever
had
and
every
time
i
drink
it
it
brings
back
memories
i
know
duvel
is
the
standard
of
the
style
but
for
me
this
one
blows
duvel
out
of
the
water
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
belgians
and
i
love
belgians
the
only
belgian
i
can
say
in
my
opinion
is
superior
would
be
la
chouffe
if
you
ever
see
the
pink
elephant
on
the
white
ceramic
bottle
give
it
a
shot
pretty
much
every
person
ive
introduced
this
to
instantly
says
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
theyve
ever
had
try
one
please
a
good
price
usually
falls
around
5
99
per
12oz
10
9913
99
per
750ml
and
21
99
per
6pack
expensive
but
worth
it
o
very
nice
world
class
pale
ale
closely
resembles
a
tripel
more
than
a
belgian
pale
i
think
well
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
amazing
basically
what
i
think
is
happening
here
is
that
its
so
carbonated
that
it
numbs
your
taste
buds
and
you
cant
really
tell
what
the
flavor
is
at
least
thats
what
happened
with
me
no
matter
how
long
i
kept
it
in
my
mouth
the
sting
of
the
carbonation
never
really
went
away
the
flavors
which
i
was
able
to
discern
werent
too
flattering
this
beer
actually
tasted
a
bit
like
raw
meat
weird
right
tasted
a
bit
like
blood
or
something
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
10
i
paid
for
it
othis
is
one
of
the
beers
that
first
got
me
into
beer
and
it
remains
delicious
in
my
book
there
are
other
more
complex
examples
of
the
style
but
for
a
traditional
strong
belgian
brew
tremens
is
still
a
good
pick
i
took
a
psychopharmacology
class
in
the
spring
of
2009
since
then
i
have
found
it
rather
hilarious
that
any
beer
would
name
itself
delirium
tremens
i
find
it
odd
that
while
the
alcohol
is
not
particularly
high
the
amount
of
sweetness
here
is
off
the
mark
way
more
pineapple
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
loaded
with
belgian
yeast
and
the
associated
flavor
profile
better
than
expected
o
impressive
but
slightly
lacking
the
x
factor
that
marks
out
great
beers
overall
its
a
very
light
and
refreshing
drink
with
a
decent
punch
my
favorite
beer
that
is
readily
available
if
only
it
werent
so
expensive
a
cool
crisp
mouthfeel
that
could
sneak
up
on
you
the
beer
could
be
drank
just
like
any
macro
but
im
sure
you
would
regret
downing
such
a
good
beef
overall
no
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
made
but
it
was
very
good
nonetheless
nonetheless
its
about
the
only
thing
i
have
to
drink
around
here
rocheforts
all
sold
out
this
delirium
the
most
important
thing
to
know
about
it
is
that
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
not
nearly
as
bad
as
those
peculiar
bitter
beers
you
can
buy
in
belgium
the
name
of
the
category
escapes
me
but
theres
something
of
the
same
spirit
in
it
a
bit
of
bitter
a
bit
of
sour
you
can
still
use
the
bottle
as
a
weapon
though
lob
that
bottle
right
and
you
can
knock
out
any
policeman
let
em
run
let
em
chase
you
in
the
rain
o
i
liked
this
beer
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
not
really
worth
the
expensive
price
here
in
quebec
i
can
get
better
belgian
styles
beers
for
far
cheaper
if
dt
is
available
in
your
area
absolutely
check
it
out
it
is
a
seductive
beer
and
leaves
an
excellent
impression
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
yeasty
flakes
nice
white
head
though
aromas
of
banana
and
citrus
peel
taste
begins
with
a
tart
spicy
note
followed
by
some
light
grain
the
finish
is
fruity
and
earthy
super
high
carbonation
and
a
nice
mouth
overall
quite
tasty
but
pretty
expensive
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
strong
pale
ales
i
have
had
its
a
pity
the
packaging
is
so
rubbish
or
id
have
had
this
a
lot
sooner
seems
very
traiditional
per
the
big
floaties
throughout
a
nice
beer
light
fruit
in
the
flavor
along
with
belgian
yeast
light
and
effervescent
all
the
way
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
i
had
to
look
for
this
for
a
long
time
before
i
finally
found
a
bottle
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
a
hole
in
the
wall
liquor
store
outside
of
boston
glad
i
spotted
the
blue
foil
top
this
is
a
must
get
for
any
belgian
lover
a
well
done
bspa
all
aspects
were
enjoyable
i
felt
that
there
wasnt
necessarily
anything
really
spectacular
which
is
the
reason
for
the
fairly
average
scoring
pours
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
the
beer
was
not
as
i
expected
there
is
a
subtle
oily
hop
presence
with
an
earthy
onion
like
flavor
the
body
of
the
beer
is
dominate
by
dark
fruit
flavors
and
grape
in
particular
this
beer
is
somewhat
sweet
and
quite
floral
in
a
tropical
sense
the
body
is
surprisingly
think
and
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
overall
pretty
darn
good
and
very
darn
different
o
overall
this
is
the
weirdest
beer
i
have
ever
had
im
giving
it
a
solid
three
because
im
simply
not
sure
what
to
think
about
it
it
pours
golden
in
color
very
thick
and
syrupy
dispite
looking
like
a
lite
beer
translucent
not
cloudy
very
sweet
smell
possibly
floral
in
there
as
well
as
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
as
the
beer
is
8
5
abv
this
beer
is
sweet
to
the
tounge
as
well
on
the
first
sip
cant
drink
it
too
fast
though
as
it
is
very
thick
and
syrupy
no
noticable
or
dercenable
bitterness
nor
any
hop
notes
excellent
taste
for
the
belgian
golden
ale
lover
o
pretty
good
not
quite
runofthemill
in
its
flavor
profile
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
either
this
was
a
great
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
on
several
occasions
but
this
one
was
the
best
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
before
or
maybe
i
can
finally
appreciate
it
the
beer
was
poured
in
a
frosted
mug
and
there
was
a
half
an
inch
of
foam
i
did
taste
a
little
bit
of
fruit
in
the
beer
but
cannot
pinpoint
which
ones
enjoyed
the
first
sip
as
much
as
the
last
i
am
looking
forward
to
my
next
glass
nevermind
this
beer
is
full
of
taste
and
exotic
flavours
grapes
spices
citrus
bananas
you
name
it
all
flavours
glow
ill
have
another
pink
elephant
right
after
this
one
cheers
o
i
dont
think
of
this
as
a
particularly
refined
belgian
that
may
be
the
reason
that
i
dont
buyorder
it
very
often
maybe
thats
not
fair
i
dunno
however
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
is
that
a
pink
elephant
i
see
for
whatever
reason
this
one
really
popped
for
me
tonight
d
finishes
a
bit
light
but
may
had
been
intentional
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
moscato
warming
sensation
rjt
oddoesnt
suit
me
much
i
was
surprised
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
but
after
actually
trying
it
i
understand
why
it
took
me
until
now
great
brew
without
any
question
there
are
many
details
in
many
aspects
to
get
as
a
gimmick
not
even
the
beer
quality
itself
but
also
with
the
unique
label
and
bottle
design
love
that
its
nice
but
considering
the
style
it
doesnt
fulfill
its
potential
i
would
expect
more
taste
complexity
and
depth
so
it
could
stand
up
to
the
modest
alcohol
contentbooziness
as
a
person
who
is
not
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
i
find
myself
enjoying
delirium
tremens
despite
it
being
a
belgian
strong
ale
pale
gold
hazy
and
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
head
it
smelled
sweet
and
fruity
tart
green
apples
close
to
no
banana
and
clove
in
the
nose
but
it
was
detectable
near
the
end
as
it
warmed
very
strong
tasting
best
description
would
be
too
imagine
what
an
imperial
belgian
would
taste
like
tart
and
dry
fruity
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
mediumthin
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
carbonation
almost
over
carbonated
actually
only
slightly
less
carbonated
than
an
american
pale
lager
in
my
opinion
coriander
and
spice
notes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
very
hot
and
warming
with
an
alcoholic
buzz
started
minutes
after
the
first
several
sips
the
name
is
very
appropritate
id
drink
this
again
o
very
drinkable
but
not
what
i
would
consider
a
typical
belgium
strong
ale
def
a
strong
belgian
beer
but
what
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
with
a
refreshing
pale
ale
was
served
in
a
snifter
glass
i
had
it
with
fish
and
chips
and
went
perfectly
i
did
experience
some
weird
dreams
last
night
but
woke
up
and
with
a
slight
head
ache
definitely
get
it
again
o
excellent
all
around
bspa
it
has
an
all
around
beautiful
appearance
it
has
a
wonderful
bouquet
if
you
like
apples
your
going
to
be
in
for
a
real
treat
over
all
this
is
a
top
notch
brew
o
good
belgian
beer
would
be
great
with
a
medium
cheese
or
salty
meat
dryness
is
appropriate
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
o
delirium
packs
a
punch
at
8
7
but
its
duplicitous
neither
the
smell
nor
taste
give
the
higher
alcohol
content
away
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
would
pair
well
with
pastry
like
croissants
its
yeast
and
spices
would
compliment
butter
pastry
perfectly

with
lots

spicy
and
fruity
delirium
tremens
is
a
very
fine
strong
ale
but
i
prefer
la
guillotine
by
the
same
brewer
its
not
the
best
ever
but
it
borders
on
great
i
will
buy
it
again
and
again
o
absolutely
one
of
the
best
bspas
ive
had
its
right
up
there
with
duvel
a
little
pricey
as
most
belgians
are
but
definitely
worth
it
great
beer
final
thoughts
a
good
beer
but
not
really
the
type
of
belgian
beer
i
usually
enjoy
would
i
drink
it
again
perhaps
in
a
few
years
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
the
guys
over
at
huyghe
its
quite
strong
at
8
5
abv
and
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
so
take
this
one
slow
youll
want
to
savor
it
anyway
this
is
some
very
tasty
stuff
g
the
high
abv
would
definately
do
again
overall
it
was
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
it
was
also
the
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
ive
tried
it
wont
be
the
last
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
on
many
levels
those
of
a
strong
ale
a
wit
or
hefe
and
a
pale
ale
such
a
complex
ale
with
notes
from
all
over
and
a
completely
impressive
pour
this
is
a
beer
thats
worth
the
high
price
not
one
id
drink
every
day
even
if
i
could
just
because
its
so
unique
and
multilayered
that
it
deserves
the
status
of
a
celebration
beer
o
excellent
strong
belgian
brew
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
o
this
is
a
wellcrafted
and
goodtasting
beer
similar
to
a
duvel
but
that
may
be
its
limiting
factor
because
it
is
so
similar
to
a
duvel
without
being
superior
and
probably
being
slightly
lessavailable
it
isnt
probably
a
return
to
beer
for
me
all
fans
of
belgian
pales
need
to
give
it
a
try
though
because
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
od
excellent
drinkability
and
very
much
to
style
if
you
are
into
belgians
just
seek
it
out
great
beer
o
above
average
but
not
world
class
in
my
opinion
ive
had
better
belgian
strongs
one
of
my
first
belgium
strong
pale
ales
and
i
like
it
a
nice
balanced
brew
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
belgians
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
its
good
overall
a
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
beer
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
was
granted
the
title
of
best
beer
in
the
world
enjoy
with
a
few
hunks
of
mild
cheddar
and
youll
be
in
heaven
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
too
sharp
with
the
dry
carbonation
for
my
taste
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
a
very
easy
drink
especially
for
a
belgian
its
a
great
representation
of
belgians
perfectly
balancing
all
the
complex
smells
and
flavors
in
their
recipes
might
be
my
new
favorite
bspa
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
flavorful
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
and
sneaks
up
fast
this
is
a
beer
that
is
welcome
on
almost
any
occasion
year
round
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
shortlived
white
head
aroma
is
of
ripe
fruit
some
citrus
notes
and
caramel
body
is
medium
and
slightly
crisp
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
herbal
and
piney
hops
and
ripe
fruit
fill
the
mouth
long
dry
finish
tasty
brew
o
this
beer
looks
phenomenal
in
the
glass
and
it
has
a
very
interesting
flavor
i
like
it
a
lot
o
this
is
a
big
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
a
little
too
strong
to
have
multiple
in
a
session
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
this
style
o
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
hides
the
booze
incredibly
well
and
can
sneak
up
on
you
quick
i
do
note
that
i
think
i
prefer
the
bottled
version
slightly
over
tap
ill
have
another
overall
amazing
how
weak
the
smell
is
and
how
great
it
tastes
i
mean
the
difference
could
rename
the
beer
to
oxymoron
still
regardless
it
smells
like
nada
but
it
is
still
a
man
among
boys
salud
i
always
thought
nocturnum
was
better
but
maybe
im
changing
sides
a
classic
this
one
pours
a
bubbly
but
clear
pale
golden
color
and
a
fizzy
white
head
a
little
esther
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
fruity
character
i
pick
up
apple
and
something
a
little
more
tropical
the
carbonation
and
fruitiness
make
for
a
little
pucker
upon
each
sip
for
this
style
of
beer
its
near
perfect
that
along
with
the
unique
packaging
make
for
a
really
cool
beer
overall
i
was
happy
i
had
this
on
draught
i
doubt
it
that
i
would
seek
this
out
in
the
bottle
very
pleasant
beer
this
is
a
bit
unique
for
me
the
fruitiness
that
comes
through
is
more
complex
than
im
used
to
the
cinnamon
was
a
nice
touch
this
was
a
decent
beer
overall
i
would
probably
have
this
again
the
taste
has
banana
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
i
like
how
theres
an
amazing
balance
between
fruity
yeast
and
sweet
malt
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
way
too
easy
for
a
belgian
pale
overall
a
wonderful
tasting
very
drinkable
belgian
strong
pale
it
has
great
flavors
transitions
as
well
as
a
wonderful
smell
and
feel
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
the
tobu
department
store
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
poured
into
a
rochefort
goblet
beautiful
thick
white
head
with
a
light
wheathued
color
smell
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
like
grapes
and
apples
with
ethanol
and
hops
present
as
well
the
flavor
seemed
to
match
the
smell
with
a
bit
too
much
of
the
sourness
coming
through
for
my
taste
overall
this
was
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
with
so
much
competition
i
would
put
it
lower
than
some
others
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
recommend
it
but
i
might
have
to
revisit
it
in
order
to
give
a
better
opinion
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
is
fairly
clear
strawgolden
color
with
a
thick
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
mediumhigh
spicy
and
peppery
phenols
beneath
the
phenols
are
some
fruity
cherry
notes
a
pleasant
nose
the
flavor
is
rather
complex
initially
spicy
and
peppery
then
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
emerges
enhanced
by
a
slightly
tart
and
notably
dry
finishes
beneath
it
all
are
noticeably
fruity
notes
and
finally
a
bit
of
hop
emerges
again
long
after
the
swallow
the
body
is
moderate
boosted
up
by
an
appropriately
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
all
around
well
made
beer
glad
i
tried
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
conforms
to
my
faint
memories
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
that
is
always
welcome
in
the
glass
if
only
they
could
bottle
that
smell
overall
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
i
finally
found
it
and
i
am
very
happy
i
did
very
good
but
i
wouldnt
enjoy
more
than
a
few
or
you
will
be
quickly
inebriated
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
belgian
strong
ale
but
it
is
still
quite
good
a
very
balanced
brew
as
others
have
mentioned
it
is
unfortunately
a
bit
pricey
o
a
nice
belgian
beer
though
it
is
rather
pricey
a
very
dry
taste
and
finish
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
front
that
is
reminiscent
of
white
wine
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
zest
come
through
lightly
in
the
front
side
of
the
palate
as
well
here
is
where
it
comes
right
to
the
brink
of
tart
but
is
dried
out
by
the
peppery
notes
and
hops
it
moves
into
a
very
inviting
dryness
with
the
help
of
these
light
peppery
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
clove
the
hops
then
come
in
with
a
lemon
grassy
quality
that
goes
well
with
the
carbonation
and
peppery
notes
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
proves
to
have
more
yeasty
notes
nothing
overly
funky
but
a
definite
added
belgiany
farmhouse
character
the
vinous
qualities
are
very
pleasant
and
work
well
with
this
beer
the
bone
dry
taste
is
superb
and
complex
letting
this
beer
shine
i
definitely
recommend
for
the
fan
of
belgians
as
this
one
is
worth
it

dark

belgian
beer
top
notch
for
any
occasion
packs
a
sneaky
punch
at
8
5
wacky
name
and
pink
elephant
aside
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
it
may
be
hard
to
get
past
what
seems
like
gimmicky
packaging
but
the
strong
belgian
pale
ale
inside
is
well
worth
the
effort
the
rich
golden
colour
is
enticing
the
thick
white
head
inviting
and
then
you
get
a
whiff
of
the
spicy
fruity
nosethat
belgian
yeast
working
its
magicand
man
its
just
amazingly
complex
and
fragrant
great
carbonation
makes
the
high
level
of
sweetness
tolerable
and
it
has
a
fairly
dry
finish
again
you
get
the
complexity
of
the
interplay
of
the
malt
kandi
sugar
and
yeast
and
all
kinds
of
fruity
flavours
pop
uppear
pineapple
citrus
peel
d
ill
admit
im
a
sucker
for
pretty
much
of
yeasty
belgian
brew
and
this
was
no
exception
being
from
western
canada
i
dont
see
very
much
american
craft
so
much
of
my
craft
beer
experience
has
been
focused
on
belgian
beer
which
we
seem
to
get
a
lot
of
having
unibroue
up
here
as
well
doesnt
hurt
an
all
around
tasty
and
balanced
belgian
but
a
step
below
some
others
ive
tried
its
also
a
touch
too
weighty
and
sticky
to
make
for
a
great
summer
time
brew
overall
a
fine
belgian
offering
that
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
more
of
down
the
road
better
than
a
duvel
pours
a
glowing
honey
color
with
a
very
thick
foaming
white
head
that
lasts
forever
smells
like
belgian
yeast
a
touch
of
wildflower
honey
light
wheat
malt
and
sticky
hops
flavor
is
close
to
the
nose
although
without
the
honey
sweetness
more
of
a
floral
character
presents
itself
with
mild
spice
and
assertive
hoppiness
for
the
style
feel
is
nice
too
more
body
than
a
duvel
not
full
or
anything
but
medium
at
least
nice
carbonation
lasts
the
whole
glass
10
bucks
for
a
10oz
is
too
much
money
for
this
at
linger
north
denver
but
it
is
a
very
very
good
beer
originally
reviewed

o
awesome
an
incredibly
unique
ale
not
only
worth
tasting
but
having
a
steady
supply
o
will
not
be
buying
from
the
bottle
anytime
soon
but
will
have
to
revisit
this
on
draft
i
remember
getting
a
lot
more
apple
and
pear
on
draft
as
well
as
enjoying
it
a
bit
more
poured
from
11
2oz
ceramic
bottle
into
piraat
tulip
pours
a
thick
froathy
head
hazy
straw
golden
color
nice
belgian
yeast
aromas
mixed
with
a
bit
of
banana
clove
and
fruit
great
taste
very
similar
to
aroma
belgian
yeasts
and
malts
with
banana
and
clove
notes
very
full
of
flavor
and
quite
delicious
this
truly
is
an
excellent
brew
i
have
had
before
but
not
reviewed
id
like
to
revisit
on
tap
o
this
is
definitely
a
good
bspa
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
carbonation
can
get
a
bit
annoying
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
watered
down
compared
to
the
nose
osuch
a
great
and
creamy
belgian
pale
ale
i
love
this
beer
it
has
all
the
great
flavors
and
its
so
easy
to
drink
o
an
excellent
strong
pale
ale
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
sometime
soon
beertown
has
it
on
tap
it
is
complex
and
a
real
joy
to
sip
on
delirium
tremens
is
a
hazy
burnt
orange
beer
with
a
stark
white
fluffy
head
that
piles
high
very
light
bready
malt
under
yeast
pepper
and
spice
pleasant
and
inviting
sweet
biscuit
with
a
significant
pepper
spice
and
a
hint
of
apple
that
leads
to
a
dry
finish
spicy
sweetness
lingers
until
the
next
sip
pepper
and
spice
grows
with
the
warmth
initially
with
the
8
5
alcohol
remaining
unapparent
the
entire
time
taste
goes
a
little
flat
when
it
warms
too
long
oddly
it
helps
the
taste
to
warm
a
little
but
theres
a
window
of
peak
flavor
for
this
beer
ive
always
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
can
see
why
its
a
popular
at
multiple
tap
bars
its
a
quality
beer
thats
extremely
approachable
if
anyone
is
interested
in
reading

this
is
not
a
commercial
site
just
my
tasting
notes
for
fun
really
nice
to
look
at
light
clear
pear
color
with
a
healthy
head
and
tons
of
beading
great
lacing
the
nose
is
super
estery
ripe
fruits
green
apple
banana
also
some
clove
the
taste
mimics
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
soft
tangy
finish
that
ends
up
clean
extremely
drinkable
dangerously
so
overall
a
musttry
overall
delightful
lots
going
on
here
sweet
spicy
bitter
not
sure
if
the
january
2011
on
the
bottle
was
the
born
on
or
freshness
date
the
reviews
for
this
are
so
high
because
it
seems
to
be
the
standard
for
lots
of
beers
that
have
come
after
this
theres
so
much
carbonation
and
booze
here
that
it
detracts
a
bit
but
anyone
who
downs
a
full
bottle
of
this
should
be
proud
for
expanding
his
or
her
beer
horizons
if
nothing
else
the
flavors
work
decently
together
and
no
beer
will
taste
quite
the
same
again
once
this
is
downed
just
ask
the
pink
elephants
o
very
solid
and
well
constructed
belgian
ale
not
perfect
by
any
means
but
is
a
treat
to
share
with
a
friend
or
two
or
your
other
half
overall
very
desirable
would
get
a
kinky
party
going
m
excellent
sensation
balanced
and
well
built
some
sweetness
and
little
bitterness
are
present
and
a
lasting
ending
o
great
belgian
brew
o
as
i
said
before
i
dont
mind
the
5
for
12oz
at
all
as
this
was
a
good
one
worth
trying
at
least
once
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
but
a
bit
expensive
o
a
tasty
belgian
a
little
disappointing
though
flavors
seemed
a
tad
mild
nothing
crazy
or
unique
solid
brew
though
would
like
to
try
a
bottle
d
a
text
book
belgian
pale
ale
very
good
but
a
bit
understated
in
a
facets
excellent
representation
of
the
style
well
above
average
but
far
from
head
of
the
class
painted

pours
clear
golden
with
a
big
massive

head
into
my

glass
bready
spicy

the
big

some
hay
and
honey
as
well
taste
is
yeast
and
a
little
clove
spice
light
sweetness
dry
finish
this
drinks
pretty
easy
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
i
know
i
am
in
the
minority
on
that
i
would
prefer
nocturnum
but
this
is
plenty
drinkable
just
not
particularly
exciting
this
was
a
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
im
glad
my
friend
got
a
bottle
of
this
for
me
the
drinkability
is
just
right
the
8
5
is
well
hidden
and
it
isnt
so
light
that
i
fly
through
it
or
so
heavy
that
im
sitting
on
it
for
a
while
see
you
on
the
next
one
poured

the

is
somewhat
lacking

medium

feel
a
pleasant
belgian
ale
o
nice
intro
to
belgian
style
ales
not
the
best
balance
for
the
style
poured
from
750ml
bottle
immediately
noted
the
large
promintent
nearpure
white
hear
very
tight
foam
almost
a
soapy
quality
in
how
it
forms
and
laces
the
glass
it
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
visible
sediment
and
abundant
carbonation
visible
that
fuels
the
longlasting
head
it
smells
very
sweet
a
combination
of
floral
hops
and
a
number
of
fruits
that
i
couldnt
easily
decipher
when
you
first
take
a
sip
it
begins
by
being
sweet
as
soon
as
you
pull
the
glass
away
the
spiciness
sets
in
and
it
is
honestly
very
unique
compared
to
everything
else
ive
had
as
it
settles
there
are
slight
notes
of
bitterness
and
long
lingering
spiciness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
could
barely
tell
the
alcohol
content
was
so
high
while
drinking
very
high
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
take
away
medium
mouthfeel
that
lingers
with
the
taste
overall
a
great
and
unique
beer
o
i
love
the
highcaliber
crispness
of
dt
my
wife
is
a
fan
too
if
you
like
lighter
tastes
in
beer
this
one
will
wrap
itself
around
your
taste
buds
and
squeeze
yum
o
a
good
ale
for
on
a
warm
day
o
very
drinkable
and
nice
but
not
as
complex
or
exciting
as
some
of
bspa
i
have
tried
poured
from
bottle
notched
42010
to
a
duvel
tulip
ive
been
eying
this
one
a
while
finally
pulled
the
trigger
the
beer
is
a
yellow
golden
color
with
a
good
2
5
finger
white
billowing
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
an
impressive
blend
of
citrus
orange
and
lemon
with
a
gentle
belgian
clove
and
malty
sweetness
no
hint
of
alcohol
whatsoever
the
flavor
is
a
crisp
citrus
fruit
with
bananas
and
clove
from
the
yeast
the
malty
sweetness
works
well
to
balance
the
mild
bitterness
again
not
hint
of
alcohol
very
good
finishes
crisp
with
a
lingering
fruit
sweetness
on
the
tongue
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
price
tag
would
be
the
only
thing
keeping
me
away
which
wont
be
for
long
enjoyable
apple
is
dominant
and
things
are
both
slightly
sweet
and
dry
simultaneously
i
prefer
hoppier
bspas
but
this
a
certainly
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
pours
a
perfectly
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
extremely
bright
white
head
aroma
of
green
apple
and
pear
predominately
with
belgian
yeast
and
hints
of
pepper
in
the
background
flavor
begins
with
a
sweet
and
tangy
kick
of
apples
and
pear
really
crisp
belgian
yeast
clove
and
a
dash
of
pepper
offer
a
nice
secondary
flavor
profile
light
crisp
and
well
executed
o
consistent
and
complex
approachable
yet
challenging
great
anytime
of
year
versatile
alone
or
with
a
variety
of
foods
o
pretty
good
had
a
crappy
night
when
i
tried
this
so
that
memory
will
probably
keep
me
from
drinking
this
ever
again
nice
name
though
overalldrinkability
this
beer
thought
i
dont
find
to
be
super
complex
is
pretty
refreshing
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
overall
pretty
nice
and
enjoyable
i
think
overall
belgian
pale
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
but
if
you
do
like
them
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
from
notes
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
hue
with
an
ample
head
white
head
about
two
fingers
worth
the
carbonation
is
fairly
aggressive
with
fine
champagne
like
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
grassy
with
hints
of
grain
citrus
lemon
hops
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
crisp
with
hints
of
citrus
lemon
pepper
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
verging
on
heavy
bodied
overall
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
one
that
doesnt
take
any
real
risk
or
bring
any
stand
out
quality
to
the
brew
o
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
was
surpised
by
i
knew
it
would
be
good
but
i
expected
another
duvel
this
is
not
much
like
duvel
and
it
really
is
pretty
unique
o
ive
always
been
intrigued
by
this
beer
given
the
very
unique
bottle
a
good
brew
noce
for
the
style
definitly
refreshing
o
not
living
up
to
what
for
me
had
been
a
lot
of
hype
still
a
really
good
beer
just
nothing
ill
rush
out
and
grab
again
in
the
near
future
i
have
noel
and
nocturnum
and
am
expecting
ill
favor
those
to
the
tremens
still
recommended
to
any
fan
of
pale
ales
o
i
grabbed
this
beer
for
its
name
and
im
not
disappointed
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
for
special
occasions
overall
there
is
nothing
mindblowing
about
this
beer
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
goes
down
very
easy
even
with
the
considerable
alcohol
content
a
nice
beer
for
entry
level
craft
beer
aficionados
quite
distinct
and
memorable
for
me
as
this
was
one
of
the
first
belgian
ales
i
ever
sampled
and
got
me
into
my
journey
into
craft
beer
o
this
very
good
stuff
i
love
it
o
ill
give
it
a
3
5
because
i
think
they
achieved
what
they
were
trying
to
do
but
i
was
overall
not
a
fan
overall
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
this
one
the
aromas
brought
me
to
a
place
that
reminded
me
almost
of
childhood
but
the
flavors
didnt
quite
follow
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
but
the
initial
conflict
between
the
aroma
and
flavor
threw
me
off
i
would
definitely
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
each
aspect
separately
the
aromas
and
flavors
just
werent
speaking
the
same
language
to
me
poured
from
a
bottle
into
duvel
glass
a
bit
hazy
yelloworangish
with
a
very
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
stays
bubbly
smells
a
bit
yeasty
sweet
and
fruity
some
pears
the
taste
mathced
aroma
well
sweet
fruity
but
also
had
a
bit
of
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
lots
of
carbonation
but
not
harsh
very
airy
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
has
a
great
aroma
and
taste
and
is
not
heavy
definitely
a
bottle
you
can
put
down
alone
and
enjoy
it
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
wish
i
hadnt
put
off
so
long
trying
it
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
now
and
ill
more
than
likely
buy
another
for
my
non
beer
drinking
friends
to
enjoy
overall
very
well
balanced
belgian
strong
pale
ale
top

pours
a
hazed
and
bubbly
golden

big
yet
controlled
cap
of

settles
into
nice

good
rings
towards
the

scent
is
pale
straw
light
watery
fruits
such
as
apple
and
pear
moderate
spice
from

a

dictates
spicier
too
solid
watery
fruit
notes
and
fresh
bready
yeasts
medium
bodied
bubbly
and
briskly
at
first
as
carbonation
escapes
becomes
smooth
dry
finish
overall
great
representation
of
the
style
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
great
there
is
not
much
more
i
can
say
about
this
beer
it
is
very
well
known
and
i
havent
met
a
person
that
doesnt
like
it
if
you
see
this
drink
it
o
this
beer
along
with
duvel
are
the
abc
of
belgian
strong
pales
an
absolute
must
try
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
that
is
worth
having
again
pink
elephants
from
belgium
whod
have
thunk
it
overall
my
favorite
beer
of
the
style
so
well
balanced
and
delicious
doa
maybe
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
was
it
was
a
wee
too
carbonated
other
than
thati
thumbs
up
excellent
o
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
at
a
mellow
mushroom
with
some
good
friends
over
awesome
pizza
great
combination
this
beer
is
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
no
doubt
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
for
the
coast
this
could
be
a
more
common
beer
for
me
i
simply
like
other
choices
even
local
ones
a
little
more
for
my
beer
dollar
would
have
no
trouble
recommending
this
as
long
as
i
warned
the
consumer
about
the
floaties
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
solid
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
banana
aromas
with
some
sweet
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
refreshing
spicy
and
a
little
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
overall
this
brew
is
very
good
in
my
opinion
its
surely
one
to
try
when
you
get
the
chance
too
o
the
appearance
is
just
so
far
out
of
my
comfort
zone
i
cant
not
penalize
it
that
said
the
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
were
fine
but
not
stunning
in
any
way
no
need
to
ever
try
this
again
but
maybe
its
for
the
connoisseurs
even
if
this
bottle
is
beautiful
the
content
is
not
that
amazing
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pale
ale
what
should
you
drink
with
tremens
beethovens
ninth
last
movement
nothing
less
this
is
earth
shattering
very
aromatic
and
flavourful
beer
a
benchmark
belgian
ale
overall
good
bsps
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
dry
fruity
beautiful
level
of
duvel
but
it
is
very
tasty
in
its
own
right
o
a
really
nice
belgium
ale
with
a
lot
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
love
in
belgium
beers
lots
of
complexities
very
light
pale
yellow
with
ample
foamy
head
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
greets
you
upon
pouring
the
taste
is
equally
fruity
with
some
spices
and
theres
a
nice
crispness
to
beer
im
rather
new
to
belgiums
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
one
is
a
keeper
overall
a
nice
bspa
this
is
not
one
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
certainly
one
to
visit
every
now
and
then
of
the
delirium
beers
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
but
it
is
still
solid
conclusion
a
definite
beer
to
revisit
time
and
time
again
a
prime
example
of
the
style
dont
let
the
fun
marketing
fool
you
great
translucent
pale
golden
color
about
a
finger
of
head
and
highly
carbonated
spicy
and
yeasty
smell
typical
of
the
belgians
ive
had
slightly
sweet
and
subtle
peppery
taste
followed
by
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
from
the
carbonation
at
8
5
it
drinks
really
easily
i
could
see
myself
on
the
lake
in
the
summertime
having
one
of
these
o
this
is
my
200th
beer
review
and
this
was
a
great
beer
to
review
for
it
strong
flavorful
and
you
have
no
doubt
what
this
beer
is
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
a
amazing
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
o
this
was
pretty
damn
good
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
the
pink
elephant
o
huge
beer
on
the
palate
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
this
is
a
great
beer
in
a
really
cool
bottle
very
complex
nose
with
great
even
flavors
these
guys
have
been
around
for
over
350
years
for
a
reason
get
this
o
may
not
be
your
beer
if
you
are
not
in
love
with
belgian
yeast
but
i
sure
am
a
complex
but
yet
incredibly
drinkable
beer
was
in
jtown
pa
at
tulunes
and
tried
the
delirium
tremens
that
they
have
on
tap
and
unfortunately
i
dont
think
their
co2
tank
was
working
properly
the
color
was
clear
copper
but
absolutely
not
carbonation
or
head
a
dead
beer
the
smell
included
spice
clove
and
some
bananacitrus
the
taste
had
a
boost
from
the
abv
but
their
was
definite
spiceclove
taste
mouthfeel
sucked
since
it
was
a
dead
beer
and
the
higher
abv
did
not
make
this
a
session
overall
though
the
flavor
and
smell
was
good
spectacular
one
of
my
favorite
beers
beautiful
color
and
wonderful
taste
the
high
carbonation
compliments
to
complex
pallet
and
aromas
if
poured
correctly
it
has
an
impressive
yet
subtle
head
initially
has
a
sweet
and
fruity
taste
and
it
closes
with
a
mild
hop
and
bitter
taste
lots
of
spice
and
flavor
truly
an
enjoyable
beer
the
pour
was
pale
and
had
quite
a
head
as
i
expected
the
smell
was
so
complex
i
didnt
know
how
to
describe
it
one
thing
i
know
is
that
it
did
not
prepare
me
for
the
taste
the
taste
was
very
strongly
yeasty
and
that
did
not
sit
well
with
me
there
were
also
clove
and
fruity
hops
present
but
the
yeastiness
dominated
that
immediately
prevented
me
from
enjoying
this
beer
i
do
not
like
yeasty
beers
so
i
cant
say
anything
good
about
this
one
if
you
dont
like
a
dominating
yeasty
flavour
either
then
dont
even
try
this
one
if
you
do
i
guess
you
can
give
it
a
try
it
was
a
bit
sour
even
very
much
not
my
thing
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
on
draft
which
is
saying
something
definitely
worth
trying
slight
adjustment
based
on
an
ontap
tasting
in
may
2012
overall
the
beer
leaves
a
good
impression
but
i
believe
a
bit
more
maturity
would
do
well
for
this
one
overall
good
blend
of
refreshing
flavors
that
come
together
for
a
sharp
and
refreshing
beer
thanks
to
my
buddy
carl
for
this
coveted
sample
this
one
shows
a
bright
pale
golden
yellow
color
that
is
just
jumping
with
speed
demon
bubbles
and
a
big
frothy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
wheaty
earthy
clove
pleasant
and
likable
the
flavor
brings
apricot
banana
and
a
kiss
of
citrus
of
course
there
is
a
clove
touch
as
well
its
tart
and
lively
in
feel
with
medium
body
its
very
drinkable
and
smooth
a
classic
my
favourite
belgian
elephant
i
had
a
bomber
of
this
about
a
year
ago
and
i
was
drunk
after
i
recommend
this
beer
but
if
you
get
a
bomber
make
sure
you
share
it
overall
complex
beer
excellent
yeast
character
and
decently
drinkable
mostly
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
torrent
of
bubbles
rushing
up
from
the
bottom
to
form
the
foamy
white
head
orange
zest
and
spicy
phenols
in
the
nose
fruity
esters
of
orange
pineapple
pear
and
melon
complement
the
pale
sweet
malts
alcohol
is
welldisguised
and
this
one
can
really
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
mediumbodied
and
crisp
with
an
almost
champagnelike
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
this
was
my
first
delirium
and
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
it
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
about
half
of
a
fingers
worth
of
foam
which
disipated
pretty
quickly
they
smell
was
amazing
but
i
had
to
sniff
it
several
times
as
i
was
trying
to
think
of
what
it
smelled
like
it
came
to
me
that
this
beer
reminded
me
alot
of
hoegarden
but
it
tasted
2x
better
than
a
hoegarden
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
can
not
wait
to
hae
another
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
that
was
served
in
a
delirium
tremens
glass
but
a
bit
too
cold
i
had
to
let
it
warm
and
once
it
did
wow
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
i
noticed
some
cherry
flavors
and
even
a
bit
of
hops
it
had
a
long
sweet
finish
which
i
loved
i
cant
stress
this
enough
this
beer
needs
to
be
served
at
almost
room
temperature
in
order
to
really
taste
it
i
wish
that
i
wouldnt
have
drank
half
of
the
beer
before
i
decided
to
let
it
warm
overall
an
awesome
beer
i
may
review
it
higher
once
i
have
some
more
experience
with
it
o
got
better
and
more
complex
as
it
warmed
my
bad
there
as
i
opened
it
straight
out
of
the
fridge
i
can
see
how
some
people
love
this
but
its
not
for
me
really
heres
another
great
belgian
beer
i
should
always
keep
in
stock
o
light
beer
banana
sweet
nut
flavors
thin
easy
to
drink
o
a
beautiful
easy
drinking
belgian
strong
pale
ale
world
class
overall
this
is
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
i
like
it
better
than
duvel
which
seems
to
grassy
for
me
this
beer
is
a
true
classic
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
overall
hmmm
it
was
good
but
still
reflecting
on
the
price
of
4
89
a
12
oz
bottle
in
that
light
compared
to
a
bomber
of
chimay
blue
they
are
similarly
priced
and
chimay
is
better
still
it
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
will
buy
it
again
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
kind
of
expensive
for
what
i
got
i
had
it
at
10
for
a
pint
if
i
can
get
it
at
68
then
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
buy
again
otherwise
id
rather
drink
something
else
a
fantastic
beer
this
has
been
in
my
celar
for
over
3
year
this
brew
has
been
waiting
for
a
honest
person
to
truley
make
this
brew
what
it
is
a
great
brew
a
must
have
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
and
well
worth
trying
again
this
ride
is
a
really
nice
one
o
a
great
beer
soft
and
sessionable
on
the
palate
at
any
rate
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
d
a
very
tasty
and
complex
belgian
ale
theres
a
wide
array
of
yeast
byproducts
that
contribute
to
this
flavor
profile
which
manages
to
be
both
vibrantly
fruity
and
characteristically
spicy
another
beer
id
just
never
gotten
around
to
trying
but
im
glad
i
finally
have
o
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
i
expected
much
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
o
the
funky
bottle
little
pink
elephants
and
fantastic
smell
and
taste
of
this
one
makes
for
a
beer
that
delivers
on
its
hype
i
can
really
see
why
people
really
like
this
stuff
o
drinkable
and
relatively
cheap
and
available
i
like
all
of
those
things
and
it
tastes
delicious
certainly
a
go
to
if
there
isnt
something
else
there
d
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
but
standing
at
a
bold
8
5
od
its
a
cool
looking
bottle
but
thats
the
selling
point
not
the
actual
beer
better
options
out
there
for
sure
the
appearance
is
unfortunately
the
color
of
urine
head
falls
flat
quickly
no
lacing
flavour
is
a
mash
up
of
bannanagrapefruitspice
that
misses
the
mark
all
around
but
somebodys
bound
to
like
it
a
good
score
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
not
the
best
youll
ever
have
i
suspect
that
some
of
this
beers
cache
comes
from
the
odd
bottle
and
the
pretty
pink
elephants
on
the
label
do
you
see
the
pink
elephants
in
your
sleep
has
a
nice
bite
and
some
hammy
flavor
that
bends
slightly
toward
tripel
territory
it
finishes
with
a
surprising
banananess
that
masks
the
booze
worth
a
bottle
but
not
more
d
not
sure
what
wreaked
this
pour
but
not
the
best
looking
brew
otherwise
slightly
above
average
aroma
and
flavor
make
this
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
just
not
great
o
solid
ale
from
start
to
finish
will
definitely
buy
again
and
again
overall
a
classic
and
very
enjoyable
beer
its
downside
is
that
it
is
very
sweet
particularly
in
smell
i
generally
prefer
duvel
myself
which
avoids
this
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
im
impressed
with
this
one
lots
of
excellent
flavors
rolled
into
one
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
though
love
the
name
and
the
brew
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
the
taste
follows
through
with
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
to
yeasty
spicey
flavors
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
and
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
understand
why
people
love
this
beer
but
it
is
not
my
type
of
brew
nice
sweet
taste
fruity
undertones
and
bit
of
hops
in
there
overall
it
was
good
well
balanced
and
drinkable
this
beer
in
my
opinion
didnt
live
up
to
its
reputation
it
was
also
a
little
pricey
this
one
might
look
better
on
the
shelf
o
probably
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
lot
different
than
the
imperial
stouts
i
drink
and
review
most
nights
i
could
see
myself
liking
this
though
o
this
was
a
disappointing
one
for
me
would
like
to
rereview
fresh
bright
pale
blonde
more
than
one
finger
of
dense
white
head
lots
of
lace
smell
is
yeasty
and
floral
nice
hoppy
presence
fairly
clean
and
grassy
some
malt
light
alcohol
taste
is
clean
and
vibrant
lots
of
fruity
floral
notes
here
nice
hop
kick
some
spicy
notes
lightly
sweet
but
dry
in
finish
high
carbonation
full
body
with
nice
weight
dryish
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
stuff
one
of
my
favorite
strong
pale
belgians
for
sure
nice
balance
o
delirium
tremens
although
ironically
named
exemplifies
the
highest
qualities
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
in
their
life
overall
great
a
staple
example
for
the
style
great
fruits
and
malts
sweet
start
hides
the
booze
and
dry
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
solid
bspa
just
a
little
too
much
abv
coming
through
in
the
taste
im
happily
suprised
by
this
one
it
isnt
what
i
expected
but
thats
ok
with
me
that
said
i
cant
see
myself
really
coming
back
for
apple
cider
flavored
beer
overall
i
tend
to
enjoy
this
beer
thoroughly
and
was
one
that
got
me
started
into
my
belgium
ale
craze
o
this
is
a
good
beer
in
the
bottle
in
the
us
this
is
a
great
beer
on
tap
in
brussels
88
5
o
this
is
just
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
good
fit
for
many
occasions
another
example
of
qulaity
belgian
brewing
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
almost
like
a
champagne
at
the
same
time
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
with
each
sip
for
many
people
duvel
is
the
standardbearer
for
the
style
but
dt
seems
more
archetypal
to
my
tastes
it
is
hard
to
find
fault
with
either
though
neither
have
the
depth
of
flavor
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
o
a
delicious
beer
with
great
flavors
and
balance
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
lots
of
carbonation
make
this
beer
nice
and
light
easy
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
is
present
but
well
incorporated
a
very
solid
beer
and
im
glad
because
it
would
be
depressing
if
they
had
such
a
great
label
and
an
inferior
product
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
enjoy
this
at
the
delirium
bar
in
brussels
i
can
understand
why
many
people
consider
this
the
most
tasty
beer
in
the
world
unique
label
awesome
bar
and
a
delicious
taste
that
goes
down
smooth
a
must
buy
for
any
beer
drinker
while
i
can
appreciate
the
quality
of
this
brew
it
is
simply
too
sweet
and
fruity
a
beer
for
me
in
that
vein
it
is
a
lot
like
dfhs
midas
touch
good
to
pull
a
sip
or
two
but
slightly
cloying
as
you
get
halfway
through
if
sweet
honeyfruit
beers
are
your
thing
give
it
a
try
o
very
enjoyable
beer
its
extremely
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
a
well
crafted
beer
solid
belgian
ale
while
i
tend
to
stray
towards
saisons
this
is
one
belgian
strong
pale
i
will
come
back
to
year
in
and
year
out
o
a
decent
beer
but
less
than
i
had
hoped
for
bspa
is
not
my
favorite
style
id
prefer
a
bsda
or
saison
o
wonderful
beer
that
has
maybe
a
bit
more
complexity
than
duvel
but
doesnt
have
that
same
champagne
style
punch
and
overall
consistency
that
duvel
has
o
not
really
sure
what
happened
here
smelled
fine
opening
taste
was
great
and
promising
but
a
very
intense
alcoholchemical
presence
took
over
and
ruined
the
drink
for
me
my
friend
was
sharing
with
me
and
he
noticed
the
same
thing
i
did
he
has
had
this
on
tap
before
and
claims
it
tasted
nothing
like
this
would
definitely
like
to
try
another
bottle
or
ontap
in
the
future
overall
a
very
good
beer
nice
but
deceptively
alcoholic
o
it
was
just
ok
standard
belgium
pale
ale
with
just
more
alcohol
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
honestly
feel
its
only
popular
due
to
bottle
artwork
and
high
abv
but
i
will
say
its
one
of
the
best
balanced
belgium
beers
ive
had
d
the
first
beer
i
had
in
belgium
not
my
favorite
style
but
definitely
worth
trying
t
green
apple
lemon
a
bit
of
white
pepper
cloves
and
a
bit
of
grass
really
nice
and
light
and
way
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
definitely
a
keeper
the
beer
looks
as
if
it
will
have
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
it
really
doesnt
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
and
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
then
you
are
hit
again
with
that
summercitrus
thing
i
was
talking
about
earlier
there
is
toward
the
back
of
the
palate
a
subtle
change
in
flavor
but
nothing
that
lasts
or
is
noticeable
to
really
investigate
past
that
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
time
and
time
again
maybe
i
just
like
lemons
delicious
with
lots
of
bready
yeasty
qualities
and
punctuated
with
a
bit
of
spices
some
hop
notes
especially
in
the
finish
smooth
creamy
and
medium
bodied
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
extremely
smooth
for
the
high
abv
hard
to
believe
i
like
the
nocturnum
more
guess
i
need
to
buy
one
and
find
out
why
this
pours
a
yeast
cloudy
yellowish
color
which
a
frofty
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
it
has
that
belgium
aroma
its
kind
of
sweet
and
pleasant
very
nice
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
thickness
with
bubbly
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
has
that
fruity
musty
belgium
taste
which
good
with
a
strong
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
ive
had
better
da
pretty
hefty
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
but
i
only
want
one
every
few
months
and
one
at
a
sitting
a
filling
satisfying
beer
d
not
bad
might
benefit
with
aging
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
bubbles
away
quickly
malty
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
coriander
frothy
flavor
with
lots
of
citrus
and
some
of
that
coriander
flavor
coming
through
in
the
background
smooth
and
somewhat
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
lots
of
coriander
but
i
think
that
this
one
does
it
well
not
too
in
your
face
and
rounds
the
beer
off
nicely
do
real
good
beer
here
but
for
my
money
id
choose
something
else
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
if
only
for
the
name
i
doubt
i
will
regularly
purchase
it
as
there
are
beers
that
i
like
as
much
or
better
that
are
much
cheaper
but
im
very
glad
i
sampled
it
easily
my
favorite
from
belgium
thus
far
picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
hipercot
in
barcelona
a
welcome
find
for
spain
chilled
briefly
in
ice
and
poured
into
a
cognac
glass
nice
one
inch
of
head
and
mold
lacing
brilliant
yet
cloudy
gold
color
very
inviting
pale
ale
hops
and
wheat
and
sweet
smell
tastes
very
much
like
one
of
my
other
favorite
strong
pale
ales
judas
nut
is
more
complex
and
its
fruitiness
overshadows
the
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
still
light
to
medium
bodied
and
overall
a
very
fine
example
of
belgian
pale
ale
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
harsh
tight
carbonation
and
strong
alcohol
flavor
which
hurts
the
mouthfeel
lots
of
zesty
spice
with
hints
of
pepper
and
coriander
dominate
the
front
end
and
linger
over
the
earthy
hop
notes
pale
malt
and
sweet
boozy
heat
into
a
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
much
stronger
in
this
beer
than
i
remember
really
hot
for
its
abv
with
warmth
in
the
finish
this
takes
away
from
the
pleasant
light
fruit
notes
and
earthy
grassy
notes
underneath
the
spice
and
alcohol
there
are
hints
of
apple
pear
banana
and
bubblegum
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
but
now
find
it
astringent
and
one
dimensional
ill
have
to
revisit
in
another
few
years
no
clue
why
i
have
waited
so
long
to
try
this
beer
but
perhaps
im
not
sold
on
bottle
design
but
clearly
this
beer
is
all
about
whats
inside
pored
a
straw
yellow
clear
color
with
a
bit
less
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
thin
lace
around
the
rim
but
no
retention
slightly
tart
grapes
and
peaches
and
a
lovely
yeasty
aroma
that
is
as
well
balanced
in
the
nose
as
i
can
imagine
of
any
belgian
pale
slight
straw
and
browned
grass
at
the
front
followed
by
a
stringent
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
crisp
fruit
and
subdued
slickness
and
mixed
in
well
with
a
lovely
tart
finish
this
oozes
perfection
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
one
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beast
o
traditional
belgian
strong
pale
ale
great
beer
d
this
turned
out
to
be
a
truly
exciting
beer
for
me
it
was
unlike
any
other
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
it
really
drank
well
the
peculiar
label
isnt
all
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
highly
recommended
o
this
is
decent
beer
i
dont
really
care
for
some
of
the
finishing
flavors
but
it
can
be
a
value
buy
but
dont
pay
more
than
10
bones
for
a
bottle
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
full
gritty
prickly
and
slick
the
beer
isnt
heavy
but
rather
substantial
you
know
that
youre
not
drinking
a
light
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
however
immediately
upon
opening
the
bottle
the
contents
fizzed
everywhere
immediately
i
am
thinking
i
got
a
skunked
bottle
date
on
the
back
is
far
from
todays
date
yet
the
smell
is
not
quite
as
i
have
read
in
the
user
reviews
or
the
bros
reviews
and
is
still
pleasing
compared
to
most
but
not
close
to
what
i
have
read
definitely
does
not
stand
out
to
me
will
have
to
rebuy
and
retry
but
still
a
ba
fruity
with
nice
bready
notes
not
overly
sweet
very
palatable
i
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
convinced
it
has
benefited
from
the
extended
aging
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
after
2
years
in
the
bottle
it
is
certainly
a
readily
available
belgian
strong
ale
that
newcomers
to
the
style
could
begin
with
but
it
is
complex
and
tasty
enough
for
more
experienced
drinkers
to
enjoy
found
this
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
and
the
beer
poured
relatively
light
in
color
with
a
nice
head
that
hung
around
could
smell
the
banana
but
not
any
dark
fruit
i
was
expecting
it
went
down
easy
for
a
strong
beer
but
i
was
looking
for
more
complex
fruit
flavors
that
being
said
it
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
will
hit
you
hard
if
you
have
too
many
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
will
return
but
not
the
best
ive
tasted
this
beer
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
large
lacing
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
weak
and
a
bit
offensive
there
were
some
spices
noticeable
the
taste
was
complex
lots
of
different
spices
interacting
the
flavor
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
and
i
felt
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
fizzy
overall
a
good
beer
enjoyable
but
i
feel
it
could
be
better
d
although
its
really
hard
to
detect
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
dry
so
its
not
something
i
could
drink
bottle
after
bottle
o
a
good
bspa
to
have
as
a
treat
every
now
and
then
final
remarks
im
a
bit
surprised
at
the
generally
high
ratings
for
this
beer
i
absolutely
adore
duvel
but
this
is
nowhere
near
the
same
quality
with
regard
to
aroma
or
taste
i
will
have
to
review
this
again
under
different
circumstances
and
see
if
it
can
make
a
better
impression
on
me
the
one
redeeming
quality
of
d
t
is
that
the
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
making
this
a
very
easy
drinker
and
an
extremely
dangerous
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
just
average
and
isnt
quite
dry
enough
for
my
taste
it
is
however
very
creamy
so
this
makes
up
for
it
a
little
overall
a
great
beer
ill
be
buying
it
again
for
sure
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
crave
on
tap
it
i
really
dont
think
that
it
is
nearly
as
good
in
bottles
great
beer
pale
straw
color
generous
white
head
aromas
of
biscuit
and
dough
flavor
is
nice
big
bready
malt
with
a
light
fruit
to
the
finish
very
clean
and
dry
excellent
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
very
fine
mellow
smooth
crisp
well
crafted
beer
i
prefer
the
nocturnum
though
this
brew
had
a
great
taste
aroma
was
sweet
and
the
alcohol
there
but
subtle
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
great
beer
on
a
cold
day
this
beer
is
actually
a
great
beer
as
long
as
your
alive
sweet
smell
and
a
little
settling
that
coats
a
glass
the
beer
has
something
to
it
maybe
that
is
why
it
has
a
pink
elephant
on
it
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
brewer
doing
something
thats
overdone
in
a
way
that
hasnt
been
done
i
always
used
to
think
that
the
belgian
spa
style
was
a
fairly
limited
sect
but
brouwerij
huyghe
has
really
shown
me
that
there
is
a
lot
of
give
in
this
class
of
brews
for
some
purists
this
may
be
too
different
for
them
to
like
but
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
belgian
spa
and
for
me
i
feel
it
will
be
very
hard
to
beat
o
the
smell
is
a
bit
hard
to
extract
but
the
taste
is
amazing
definitely
a
great
one
if
one
is
looking
to
get
into
the
belgian
strong
pale
style
a
tasty
brew
in
a
fun
bottle
though
i
believe
i
first
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
in
philly
pa
where
it
is
generally
a
draught
staple
pours
straw
yellow
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
white
head
and
some
noticeable
carbonation
yeast
and
some
light
fruits
in
the
nose
light
fruits
on
the
palate
with
grassy
hops
in
the
background
leaving
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
pretty
light
mouthfeel
but
not
too
crisp
drinkable
but
not
something
i
prefer
when
other
options
are
available
awesome
brew
i
know
there
isnt
a
drinkability
section
anymore
but
this
one
drinks
like
a
5
and
its
8
5
very
clean
crisp
and
great
tasting
o
sort
of
a
staple
for
the
style
i
have
had
this
years
ago
and
passed
it
over
for
a
while
not
much
has
changed
with
it
since
i
last
remember
tasty
and
a
go
to
for
the
style
serving
type
bottle
overall
im
happy
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
the
bartender
really
had
a
hard
time
pouring
it
as
it
would
keep
foaming
over
so
im
not
sure
if
that
threw
the
mouthfeel
off
at
all
anyways
its
a
must
try
beer
o
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
dont
have
anything
to
say
other
than
its
good
and
id
buy
it
again
if
looking
for
a
quality
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
only
bad
thing
is
it
cost
around
8
dollars
a
beer
in
chicago
overall
great
strong
taste
and
balance
up
there
with
the
best
belgian
ales
flandes
bar
oviedo
asturias
o
this
stuff
is
incredibly
tasty
and
far
surpassed
my
expectations
definitely
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
belgian
pale
ales
and
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
a
bottle
next
time
im
at
the
local
shop
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
making
it
extremely
drinkable
and
dangerous
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
darker
small
head
wad
around
for
the
whole
consumption
massive
amounts
of
floral
and
citrus
spices
cloves
and
sweets
taste
was
the
same
really
acidic
but
seems
to
work
well
here
mouthfeel
was
well
balanced
one
of
the
better
belgian
beers
i
have
had
in
the
last
couple
of
days
overall
one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
pales
ive
had
nothing
is
overdone
and
i
really
love
the
taste
the
flavors
are
strong
enough
yet
dont
way
down
the
palate
overall
its
a
good
beer
its
like
duvel
but
not
quite
there
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
good
amount
of
off
white
foam
head
served
in
a
delirium
tremens
tulip
nose
was
bright
belgian
yeast
musty
light
fruits
typical
belgian
pale
taste
was
light
fruits
wine
like
at
first
chilled
but
more
complex
as
it
warmed
similiar
to
the
nose
prickly
carbonation
medium
bodied
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
pale
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
on
tap
still
overall
there
is
flavor
and
good
enjoyment
to
be
had
in
this
beer
its
real
easy
drinking
for
this
style
for
sure
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
pale
yellow
body
with
fizzy
white
head
which
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
almost
of
white
wine
with
some
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
fruity
and
almost
like
white
wine
it
has
a
nice
start
to
the
taste
but
a
little
sour
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
real
belgian
beer
so
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
its
ok
the
huge
chunks
were
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
i
found
that
it
wasnt
nearly
as
complex
as
a
lot
of
the
great
belgians
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
id
select
another
style
its
a
bit
better
than
a
home
brew
version
a
friend
of
mine
shared
with
me
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
d
given
the
high
abv
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
and
pretty
good
obviously
a
classic
but
still
surprises
in
its
unique
character
havent
had
anything
like
it
and
will
certainly
enjoy
it
again
o
a
all
around
good
brew
the
character
is
pleasant
and
floral
but
would
like
to
see
this
this
beer
have
a
bit
more
dry
mouthfeel
o
a
good
bspa
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
but
just
being
so
fruit
heavy
its
just
not
quite
as
spice
balanced
as
id
like
overall
not
bad
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
but
not
too
shabby
tasting
over
all
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
despite
its
complexity
it
is
not
overwhelming
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
belgian
ale
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
or
to
savor
as
it
warms
more
complexity
comes
out
its
a
really
nice
beer
but
not
something
i
want
to
drink
everyday
o
simply
excellent
way
too
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
d
its
a
fast
drinker
for
the
alcohol
level
but
im
not
sure
that
this
beer
offers
enough
in
the
flavor
department
especially
when
considered
in
its
style
to
make
me
want
to
pick
it
up
again
overall
very
refreshing
and
very
complex
a
fine
example
of
the
style
d
delicious
if
the
mark
of
a
good
beer
is
how
many
one
can
drink
in
a
sitting
this
beer
deserves
an
a
i
already
crave
for
more
dr
way
too
expensive
for
the
quality
its
not
6
85
euro
this
is
in
ireland
good
but
its
worth
a
go
for
fans
of
the
style
hides
its
abv
absurdly
dangerously
well
the
cpj
d
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
as
you
go
through
the
bottle
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
of
bread
like
malts
a
piney
hop
and
a
sweet
yeast
with
mild
notes
of
bannanas
and
citrus
it
tasted
light
and
slightly
astringent
at
first
and
finished
lightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
bannana
and
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
that
lingered
on
the
palate
for
a
while
mouthfeel
was
very
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
begian
ale
that
has
a
mild
kick
to
it
btw
i
had
it
bills
bar
burger
on
51st
street
the
burgers
are
some
of
the
best
in
nyc
and
the
beer
list
is
pretty
strong
they
could
however
improve
upon
their
draft
offerings
if
you
are
in
the
neighborhood
check
it
out
just
avoid
the
mid
week
lunch
time
crush
youll
wait
forever
my
experience
went
a
little
south
from
there
i
will
straight
away
say
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
belgian
pale
ales
the
first
sip
gives
you
a
good
taste
of
citrus
fruit
and
honey
the
last
was
surprising
in
the
best
way
possible
what
i
didnt
like
is
the
bitterness
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
that
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
i
could
not
have
had
more
than
the
one
i
still
think
that
this
ale
was
a
good
surprise
this
is
among
the
worlds
best
and
interesting
beers
its
a
must
try
and
a
personal
favorites
tap
or
bottle
d
dangerously
drinkable
with
nothing
less
than
a
triple
taste
for
a
strong
pale
ale
alcohol
content
to
tell
you
differently
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
a
brewery
im
not
going
to
bother
trying
to
spell
i
might
keep
a
few
more
of
these
around
and
im
glad
that
the
owner
of
four
winds
in
pensacola
insisted
that
i
buy
a
bottle
of
his
favorite
after
seeing
the
rest
of
what
i
purchased
overall
solid
and
very
drinkable
delirium
tremens
was
golden
in
color
and
cloudy
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
about
it
had
a
large
rocky
white
head
with
good
retention
and
left
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
fruity
yeast
with
some
spices
the
taste
was
fruit
yeast
candi
sugar
and
plenty
of
spices
the
finish
was
long
dry
and
a
bit
alcoholic
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
that
was
a
little
creamy
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
fine
belgian
ale
that
i
recommend
overall
just
solid
as
could
be
love
the
style
and
it
was
super
drinkable
nothing
at
all
to
complain
about
here
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
three
finger
off
white
head
in
my
deliruim
glass
the
smell
is
very
fruity
applepear
its
pretty
muted
vs
the
taste
however
the
taste
is
really
fantastic
and
seems
to
change
slightly
w
each
sip
this
is
a
great
beligian
and
one
ive
had
many
times
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
i
could
have
several
of
these
great
beer
and
ill
continue
to
pick
this
up
and
enjoy
this
one
delirium
tremens
is
a
fantastically
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
this
bspa
can
surely
be
appreciated
by
both
newbies
and
craft
beer
veterans
alike
d
its
alright
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
at
times
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
it
and
am
happy
to
say
that
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
d
overall
a
very
good
strong
golden
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
second
pour
with
the
stronger
phenols
and
spices
that
the
addition
of
the
yeast
provided
as
many
have
said
this
beer
is
deceivingly
easy
to
drink
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
difficulties
with
getting
a
clean
pour
from
the
opaque
bottle
mean
that
im
less
likely
to
pick
this
up
again
versus
some
of
the
other
examples
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
d
very
drinkable
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
easy
pretty
sweet
beer
d
the
sweetness
might
be
a
little
too
much
but
the
beer
is
still
pretty
damn
drinkable
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
brew
was
the
complexity
weve
certainly
had
this
brew
before
but
it
leaves
the
drinker
curious
the
heavy
malt
character
of
the
taste
coupled
with
the
contrasting
flavors
therein
moving
between
sweet
sour
and
bitterness
make
for
a
unique
brew
with
a
considerably
open
reading
frame
on
tap
into
pint
glass
or
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
yellowbrown
body
cloudy
topped
with
a
big
creamy
head
of
whitefully
lasting
sheets
and
rings
of
lace
aroma
is
earthy
grassy
lemon
clove
coriander
a
delicate
fruitiness
the
palate
is
mediumfull
with
creamy
carbonation
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
sugar
and
clove
lightly
sour
with
lemon
clove
and
a
long
lightly
hopped
finish
the
finish
is
woody
laced
with
clove
balanced
apple
cider
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
a
classic
here
d
high
cost
and
high
abv
lead
me
to
say
this
is
nicedrinking
treat
beer
d
its
so
tasty
with
dry
fruit
notes
that
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
much
caution
needs
to
be
given
to
this
brew
as
its
strong
on
the
alcohol
side
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
night
verdict
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
slowly
and
would
definitely
purchase
it
again
it
is
a
sophisticated
crisp
light
champagne
tasting
ale
510
spices
in
the
olfactory
flavors
including
dill
and
spices
from
provence
the
flavor
is
round
with
a
mouth
full
and
warm
alcoholic
which
leaves
the
aftertaste
of
bitterness
with
that
presence
always
spicy
where
it
collects
a
few
grains
of
pepper
it
also
receives
a
key
that
gives
a
sweet
finish
more
or
less
syrupy
very
good
duivelbier
probably
the
best
direct
rival
of
duvel
from
moortgat
not
sure
what
the
packaging
is
all
about
the
faux
ceramic
is
an
interesting
touch
though
query
what
it
does
to
flavor
after
prolonged
periods
the
glass
is
an
oddity
as
well
with
its
elephants
and
whatnot
though
i
guess
its
all
part
of
the
overall
experience
once
you
get
past
all
the
pomp
the
ale
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
holds
well
and
laces
even
better
the
first
sip
provides
a
bursting
cocktail
of
fruit
flavors
with
strong
honey
and
mild
pepper
good
creamy
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
in
the
sweet
maltiness
so
be
careful
it
packs
a
wallop
a
bit
too
sticky
sweet
for
my
taste
but
fine
for
those
who
prefer
that
overall
a
solid
ale
for
its
type
great
tasting
beer
very
nice
color
but
appearance
was
hurt
by
the
large
pieces
of
sediment
i
dont
mind
sediment
in
my
beer
but
these
pieces
where
quite
large
its
light
brew
but
too
sweet
for
me
and
being
that
its
the
same
price
as
an
allagash
i
dont
think
ill
have
againm
anytime
soon
i
think
12oz
of
this
is
good
for
a
session
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
do
a
bomber
of
this
on
my
own
only
for
sharing
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
belgium
on
special
occasions
i
had
somewhat
the
same
feeling
from
drinking
dt
on
draft
but
enjoyed
it
more
its
frutier
than
duvel
and
a
little
sweeter
but
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
great
carbonation
and
aroma
overall
veyr
good
beer
that
lived
up
to
expectations
drinkability
highly
drinkable
at
first
i
thought
this
was
a
gimmick
with
the
high
alcohol
and
pink
elephants
on
the
label
but
its
actually
quite
good
despite
its
abv
it
is
light
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
if
you
can
find
out
pick
it
up
this
is
a
great
but
unique
belgian
strong
golden
ale
it
has
great
drinkability
and
goes
great
with
a
burger
wow
an
amazing
beer
my
girlfriend
doesnt
really
care
for
beer
but
she
loves
this
one
its
not
to
sweet
and
you
sometimes
forget
that
its
a
beer
its
a
little
more
expensive
but
with
an
abv
of
8
50
you
really
wont
need
as
many
as
you
would
have
of
regular
beer
i
have
to
revise
my
review
a
little
it
seems
to
me
this
beer
isnt
quite
what
it
used
to
be
i
loved
this
beer
but
it
has
proven
to
be
way
to
difficult
to
find
a
good
bottle
without
great
big
floating
particles
and
a
bitter
bite
that
shouldnt
be
there
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
color
now
im
noticing
they
are
a
much
more
pale
yellow
color
and
the
taste
has
changed
also
but
not
for
the
better
its
a
shame
because
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
they
gotta
get
back
in
the
game
with
this
beer
it
seems
like
theyre
slacking
here
extremely
similar
to
duvel
this
bspa
has
its
own
unique
profile
its
a
bit
spicier
and
not
quite
as
smooth
has
expected
yeast
and
citrus
notes
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
bit
earthy
there
is
also
pepper
and
citrus
in
the
nose
it
goes
down
quite
easy
with
the
only
drawback
being
a
slight
thinness
m
d
mouthfeel
mediumlight
smooth
the
abv
adds
to
the
substantial
feel
co2
a
bit
lively
glad
that
i
finally
decided
to
throw
some
of
these
classic
ubiquitous
belgians
in
the
closet
for
a
few
years
every
one
that
ive
had
with
some
time
on
it
has
been
fantastic
and
a
little
bit
better
than
previously
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
particularly
wellintegrated
and
downright
loveable
brouwerij
huyghes
beers
seem
to
add
an
unexpected
funk
to
classic
belgian
styles
in
the
case
of
delirium
tremens
the
fruit
flavors
and
yeast
funk
are
dominant
where
as
duvel
is
more
balanced
delirium
may
not
be
perfect
but
its
imperfections
make
it
interesting
and
make
drinkers
think
twice
about
imbibing
classics
such
as
duvel
and
chimay
delirium
tremens
is
dangerously
delicious
its
hard
to
consume
just
one
glass
of
it
and
two
or
three
will
put
you
in
your
own
personal
delirium
even
if
youre
not
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
i
still
suggest
you
give
this
beer
a
shot
p
s
this
beer
is
noticeably
better
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
but
it
would
change
my
answer
to
the
stuck
on
the
island
question
definitely
one
of
the
best
beer
ever
d
easy
to
drink
my
half
of
this
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
a
style
i
often
overlook
ill
be
happy
to
check
this
one
out
again
i
think
i
liked
the
bottle
version
better
than
the
on
tap
one
which
is
rare
for
me
a
light
gold
brew
with
a
bit
of
white
lace
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
fluffy
head
that
has
some
good
staying
power
there
are
clumps
of
stuff
swimming
in
the
glass
a
living
beer
smell
is
peppery
with
a
honeyed
malt
and
yeasty
fruitiness
apples
and
grapes
are
a
feature
taste
is
wonderful
more
like
a
tripel
than
a
bspa
that
being
said
it
does
fall
a
bit
short
of
the
tripel
standard
in
its
malt
core
the
honeysugar
notes
are
not
as
big
to
move
on
to
what
is
there
i
must
confess
a
real
love
of
the
balance
in
the
blend
malt
is
sweet
with
honey
and
cupcake
batter
pepper
with
a
coriander
like
spiciness
some
clove
and
banana
but
not
hefe
like
a
subtle
blend
of
the
two
apples
and
grapes
from
the
nose
are
here
finish
is
nicely
hopped
with
herbal
notes
and
a
dry
clean
edge
feel
is
medium
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
supple
fluidity
so
drinkable
so
tasty
so
good
you
just
go
through
the
bottle
in
an
instant
beware
as
the
high
abv
is
just
nowhere
to
be
found
an
outstanding
beer
well
worth
cellaring
saw
this
beer
on
three
sheets
back
a
few
years
ago
and
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
two
years
ago
flat
out
may
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
know
it
was
voted
that
once
but
i
dont
usually
pay
attention
to
things
like
that
it
is
a
truly
unique
especially
from
any
macrobrew
it
is
clearly
not
for
everyone
so
take
my
review
for
what
its
worth
words
cannot
describe
this
beer
it
is
one
you
have
to
try
for
yourself
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
d
like
i
said
a
beer
to
savor
the
large
portion
size
and
the
higher
abv
dont
lend
this
beer
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
nor
does
its
price
but
this
is
a
fantastic
delicious
beer
that
must
be
savored
like
a
fine
scotch
drink
one
and
be
happy
with
it
impression
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
belgium
home
to
some
some
fine
brewing
magic
pours
a
hazy
darker
golden
hue
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
carbonation
flowing
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
nice
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
smells
of
apples
fresh
pears
yeast
and
some
spicy
aromas
it
has
a
very
balanced
and
fresh
taste
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
first
some
noticeable
yeast
character
throughout
the
sip
combined
with
some
ripe
fruity
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
with
a
slight
spicy
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
a
bit
intense
on
the
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
fresh
and
flavorful
beer
that
i
could
session
if
i
could
afford
it
drinkabilty
its
pretty
smooth
and
esay
going
down
but
its
a
little
weak
and
too
yeasty
for
me
i
prefer
the
bitter
bite
of
nocturnum
moreso
however
this
is
easier
to
drink
but
still
its
8
5
alcohol
so
1
or
2
is
enough
tasted
much
like
the
smell
a
little
bland
i
generally
thought
it
wasnt
the
best
mix
in
flavour
did
a
good
job
of
masking
the
actual
abv
on
tap
at
this
years
christmas
party
thanks
kirk
pours
a
clear
golden
color
this
beer
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
bud
light
or
coors
to
the
naked
eye
once
you
get
a
whiff
of
it
though
you
know
this
is
no
bmc
the
aroma
is
slightly
funky
with
some
amazing
yeasty
spicy
flavors
with
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
very
lemony
with
great
additions
of
coriander
pepper
banana
and
delicious
belgian
yeast
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
yet
crisp
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
high
good
belgian
pale
keep
an
eye
out
for
those
pink
elephants
they
can
hurt
you
if
you
let
them
d
amazing
but
not
for
everyone
if
you
want
something
spectacular
or
perhaps
mildblowing
this
is
it
alcohol
warmth
will
occur
and
fast
the
sweetness
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
back
from
being
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
sip
and
savor
this
delicious
monster
dvery
drinkable
the
sweetness
masks
the
fact
that
its
whipping
your
ass
at
8
5
drink
with
caution
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
certainly
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
supreme
definitely
an
easy
drink
when
taken
slow
and
respectfully
drink
too
fast
and
this
beer
can
be
a
little
nasty
well
one
just
might
be
going
to
bed
early
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
nocturnum
now
after
drinking
the
the
tremons
i
dont
know
what
to
say
other
than
wow
my
favorite
part
is
the
smell
the
head
on
this
beer
is
amazing
definitely
not
as
smooth
as
the
nocturnum
i
would
say
it
deserves
just
as
much
appreciation
in
the
end
this
is
one
tasty
beer
d
a
nice
brew
lots
of
flavors
and
great
texture
this
would
have
been
an
a
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
the
appearance
drinks
better
than
delirium
noel
but
not
by
much
the
appearance
just
takes
away
too
much
because
frankly
it
looks
nasty
blindfolded
would
be
the
best
way
to
drink
beers
from
this
brewery
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
which
case
i
would
agree
with
all
the
high
ratings
other
bottle
conditioned
beers
dont
look
so
terrible
even
if
you
dont
pour
carefully
and
get
some
sediment
in
there
why
the
chunks
the
mouthfeel
was
an
extremely
pleasant
milkiness
i
felt
satisfied
with
the
volume
contained
within
one
bottle
but
i
enjoyed
every
last
drop
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
carbonation
is
high
it
has
a
very
champagne
like
quality
it
suits
it
very
well
a
great
beer
d
this
is
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
the
abv
is
deceptive
i
will
buy
this
again
but
unfortunnately
it
will
be
in
a
bottle
next
time
easy
to
enjoy
but
a
fairly
high
abv
another
solid
belgian
a
brilliant
brew
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
during
the
belgium
beer
festival
in
2005
and
it
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
ever
since
at
first
pour
it
appears
somewhat
cloudy
with
light
particulates
and
a
benign
but
pleasant
smell
however
once
it
hits
your
tongue
it
is
a
pleasure
to
behold
a
complex
mix
of
fruitmalt
flavors
hit
the
palate
and
joyfully
dance
from
front
to
back
to
one
of
the
smoothest
finishes
ive
yet
discovered
the
aftertaste
leaves
your
mouth
watering
for
another
drop
of
this
ambrosia
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
nice
spot
in
my
world
its
a
solid
beer
with
a
great
rating
i
am
told
its
on
tap
in
ottawa
now
spinrsx
and
i
will
have
to
hunt
it
down
and
give
our
review
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
glad
i
tried
it
although
next
time
i
think
ill
head
back
to
my
trusty
duvel
but
this
is
a
close
second
12
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
if
any
lacing
the
glass
could
have
used
a
quick
rinse
before
pouring
light
gold
clear
body
multiple
streams
of
carbonation
nose
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
some
coriander
notes
a
bit
of
floral
hops
but
not
much
fruity
esters
perhaps
a
bit
of
lemon
but
not
much
taste
mirrors
nose
surprised
how
how
unfruity
this
was
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
above
average
effervescence
some
stickiness
but
a
really
really
dry
finish
pretty
drinkable
though
in
retrospect
ill
have
a
duvel
next
time
wondering
how
this
compares
to
the
bottled
version
d
this
beer
is
excellent
i
drank
a
whole
750ml
to
myself
and
could
have
drank
more
the
beer
is
a
mostly
clear
orange
with
a
huge
cap
of
foam
that
stretches
past
the
apex
of
the
glass
and
comes
to
a
point
resembling
a
snowy
mountain
top
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
belgian
yeast
and
alcohol
delirium
tremens
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
the
flavor
is
more
forward
than
the
aroma
with
ripe
citrus
fruits
spices
clove
and
alcohol
i
find
the
alcoholic
aspect
to
be
too
prominent
i
would
prefer
the
potency
of
this
brew
to
be
disguised
in
a
bouquet
of
hops
andor
belgian
yeast
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
warming
finish
one
of
the
most
easily
attainable
belgian
beers
in
the
united
states
and
one
that
i
often
see
on
draft
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
this
again
at
some
point
first
i
love
the
packaging
the
beer
itself
is
amazing
the
three
yeast
strains
used
come
together
to
create
creamy
well
balance
mouth
feel
it
has
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
spice
which
is
quite
pleasant
the
flavors
and
aroma
synergy
really
make
this
an
a
beer
for
me
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
very
drinkable
having
given
dt
two
tries
i
will
leave
it
to
others
to
enjoy
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
peach
coloring
and
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
behind
a
really
nice
dose
of
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
and
spicy
with
some
light
pepper
plus
peach
sweet
malt
light
stone
fruits
and
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
taste
is
equally
as
complex
and
really
just
melds
some
tropical
citrus
and
stone
fruits
together
really
well
and
adds
in
a
touch
of
booze
nice
feel
drinks
quite
well
and
is
always
a
bit
nostalgic
for
me
the
light
and
sweet
mouthfeel
masks
the
8
5
abv
and
the
gassiness
gave
me
a
bad
case
of
the
hiccups
each
hiccup
left
me
with
a
taste
of
bananas
while
its
no
secret
im
not
a
fan
of
belgianstyle
beers
i
have
found
others
ive
enjoyed
victory
golden
monkey
this
beer
is
not
one
i
would
recommend
if
youre
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
d
clean
crisp
complex
and
refreshing
very
lively
and
vibrant
with
sweet
and
citrus
fruits
driving
through
very
drinkable
d
smooth
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
very
drinkable
but
watch
the
abv
the
cork
on
the
bottle
popped
to
the
ceiling
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
poured
a
clear
medium
yellowish
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
smell
was
of
various
fruits
and
spice
this
beer
had
a
crisp
and
clean
feel
and
was
highly
drinkable
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
d
significantly
more
drinkable
than
most
belgians
i
can
have
more
than
just
1
this
is
really
really
good
belgian
beer
pours
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
slightly
vinegary
the
flavor
is
highly
fruity
with
apricot
lemon
allspice
peach
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
extremely
prickly
wish
it
had
more
substance
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
golden
color
has
a
fizzy
head
that
mellows
to
a
slightly
creamy
head
smells
like
a
belgian
trippel
malty
with
a
hint
of
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fizzy
the
alcohol
shines
through
very
slightly
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
one
that
you
really
dont
want
to
share
great
belgian
d
couldnt
imagine
a
friday
evening
without
it
tasty
beer
that
has
some
serious
strength
md
smooth
nothing
to
write
home
about
nothing
offensive
or
notable
about
it
for
a
sbpa
i
find
that
there
are
better
options
at
this
price
point
but
always
a
solid
goto
and
it
isnt
odd
to
see
it
as
an
option
at
a
restaurant
or
a
bar
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
and
smooth
with
a
lively
carbonartion
tremens
has
big
aroma
and
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
easily
surpasses
my
experience
with
the
nocturnum
definitely
a
very
drinkable
and
recommended
belgian
classic
here
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
definitely
wouldnt
because
it
would
get
dangerous
really
fast
time
to
revisit
one
of
my
initial
forays
into
international
craft
beer
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
coriander
wheat
banana
clove
and
ginger
the
taste
holds
notes
of
banana
lemon
zest
clove
rye
bread
nearly
a
sourdough
and
a
light
sprinkling
o
black
pepper
the
body
is
a
sorta
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
now
ive
gotta
regrab
the
other
deliriums
notes
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
brew
the
style
and
how
the
fruity
profile
come
together
might
not
be
my
thing
and
in
some
circles
it
is
slightly
overhyped
in
particular
if
one
thinks
of
other
offerings
out
there
but
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
brew
this
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
white
foam
sprinkling
the
surface
the
smell
was
mainly
of
bananas
and
clove
like
would
be
assumed
with
the
belgian
beers
in
addition
to
that
there
was
the
strong
aroma
of
white
grapes
the
taste
was
fruity
mostly
green
apple
pineapple
honey
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
familiar
as
a
sweet
white
wine
would
be
similar
to
a
riesling
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
as
would
be
appropriate
with
the
delicate
flavors
that
abound
this
is
a
nice
very
easily
drinkable
beer
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
because
of
its
deceptive
lightness
and
high
abv
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
ok
so
the
price
is
semi
high
at
11
bones
eh
not
too
bad
but
everyone
should
drink
at
least
one
or
every
one
of
delirium
overall
a
very
nice
version
of
the
style
anc
certainly
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
i
will
say
that
i
enjoy
this
more
than
the
nocturnum
solid
good
across
the
board
for
me
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
due
to
all
of
the
sensations
that
this
beer
appeals
to
from
the
bottle
to
the
body
tremens
has
a
great
aesthetic
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
that
temptation
is
rewarded
with
a
seducing
nose
and
addicting
taste
drinking
this
is
a
great
experience
and
i
am
glad
it
was
my
gateway
into
better
beer
d
im
torn
on
this
its
a
good
beer
but
i
couldnt
do
too
many
based
on
the
abv
the
beer
is
good
but
lacks
depth
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
style
is
still
one
i
am
becoming
familiar
with
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
should
be
enjoyed
by
all
d
strong
flavors
and
strong
carbonation
it
only
works
well
if
the
beer
is
made
exquisitely
and
this
beer
unfortunately
has
some
problems
its
still
a
very
good
and
refreshing
drink
that
i
like
more
than
my
rating
indicates
but
the
strong
but
dull
flavor
along
with
the
aggressive
carbonation
make
this
beer
kind
of
a
chore
to
drink
there
is
way
more
head
on
this
beer
than
any
beer
i
know
of
but
the
flavor
is
wounderful
i
will
get
this
one
again
poured
an
opaque
golden
color
some
suspended
particles
huge
creamywhite
pillowy
head
smell
is
very
spicy
and
tart
also
some
good
malt
overtones
coming
through
taste
is
super
citrusy
with
a
lot
of
bite
on
the
back
end
the
head
lends
to
a
very
nice
feel
to
the
brew
because
its
a
little
thin
bitter
finish
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
pick
up
regularly
because
your
palate
always
stays
clean
each
drink
is
like
the
first
so
it
never
gets
old
its
pretty
high
in
alcohol
but
you
never
get
the
warming
feeling
so
you
never
realize
how
strong
the
beer
really
is
truly
a
world
classic
d
an
allaround
solid
brew
and
one
of
the
more
available
quality
beers
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
but
not
quite
toptier
a
great
belgian
trippel
with
a
high
alcohol
content
at
about
8
5
exactly
what
one
would
expect
from
a
traditional
belgian
ale
very
spicy
and
unique
yet
full
bodied
and
strong
additionally
it
comes
in
a
very
cool
white
ceramic
bottle
a
great
beer
to
start
exploring
belgian
beers
with
d
a
very
nice
blend
of
flavours
the
alcohol
blends
very
well
a
case
of
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
as
this
is
very
very
drinkable
over
all
weak
on
flavor
high
on
carbonation
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
smell
is
not
unpleasant
but
also
not
very
inviting
a
kind
of
dry
smell
the
taste
is
also
somewhat
dry
which
comes
after
the
first
sips
with
yeastnotes
i
have
had
better
strong
pale
ales
from
belgium
dthis
is
a
world
class
perfect
brew
i
couldnt
be
more
pleasedwhere
can
i
get
a
kegi
cant
find
one
thing
bad
to
say
about
this
unique
presentation
of
brewing
skill
i
cant
wait
to
taste
this
beer
again
in
the
glass
the
beers
deep
powerful
headiness
is
there
for
all
to
feel
a
clear
golden
colour
with
a
blitzkreig
of
bubbles
support
a
level
modest
layer
of
foam
to
start
its
acidity
really
sparkles
and
fizzes
rich
and
ridiculously
potent
almost
like
a
hallucinogenic
though
obviously
lacking
the
fine
polish
of
duvel
heavier
and
more
cloying
as
well
wasnt
long
before
i
was
ridiculously
famished
and
wasnt
long
before
i
was
off
for
a
mushroom
slice
at
a
bp
garage
this
is
an
excellent
strong
belgian
pale
ale
this
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
though
not
as
tasty
as
i
expected
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
theres
no
way
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
given
its
alcohol
content
drinkabilty
was
avergae
duvel
is
simply
better
enough
said
taste
was
too
intense
compared
to
duvel
this
stuff
just
isnt
as
good
too
many
foreign
flavours
d
great
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
get
more
of
these
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
amanti
vinos
beer
of
the
month
club
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
dull
goldenrod
closer
to
clear
than
cloudy
though
not
entirely
translucent
a
strong
pour
leads
to
a
voluminous
creamy
and
frothy
white
cap
head
retention
is
above
average
but
lacing
is
subpar
for
a
bspa
the
nose
is
mostly
sweet
grassy
and
pale
fruit
apples
and
pears
malts
theres
just
a
hint
of
spice
which
isnt
quite
enough
in
my
book
fortunately
delirium
tremens
flavor
allows
a
bit
more
of
the
yeast
influence
to
shine
through
with
some
pepper
and
clove
being
the
most
appreciable
all
the
requisite
parts
are
in
place
for
a
phenomenal
belgian
strong
pale
ale
at
least
as
far
as
flavor
goes
but
for
some
reason
the
result
is
just
a
little
bit
short
of
that
one
area
where
the
brewery
nailed
it
though
is
the
mouthfeel
theres
enough
heft
in
the
body
without
crossing
the
line
into
being
too
viscous
and
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
invigorating
and
exciting
without
seeming
fizzy
in
any
way
that
along
with
a
solid
but
not
top
notch
taste
makes
tremes
quite
quaffable
especially
with
the
alcohol
not
really
shining
through
delirium
tremens
is
a
more
than
passable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
falls
short
of
all
time
classic
status
cheers
drinkablity
is
great
on
this
beer
almost
session
worthy
but
not
just
quite
rated
a
wasnt
this
the
top
rated
beer
in
the
world
at
one
point
bravo
in
the
mouth
it
is
wow
its
pretty
light
but
thick
enough
to
keep
the
rigorous
carbonation
to
a
reasonable
level
of
softness
peach
tropicals
light
florals
and
a
very
interesting
sour
twang
gives
it
great
depth
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
easy
drinking
fantastic
tasting
notes
goes
well
with
pesto
pizza
d
very
refreshing
beer
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
but
it
is
slightly
warming
i
can
see
how
this
would
creep
up
on
you
after
two
or
more
though
dlittle
off
tasting
with
the
veggie
flavor
but
otherwise
okay
i
might
pass
on
this
next
time
quarter
pint
at
the
black
dog
pub
in
bayfield
on
yellow
gold
in
colour
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbly
white
head
and
dots
of
lacing
on
the
tulip
smell
and
taste
are
sweet
bubble
gum
baking
dough
yeast
esters
ethanol
melon
fruit
clove
orange
peel
pie
crust
fuzzy
peaches
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thick
peppery
strong
spiciness
somewhat
sour
boozy
astringency
to
finish
a
pleasant
drinkable
strong
ale
but
not
the
most
layered
or
rewarding
example
of
the
style
still
its
worth
a
go
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
dpretty
tasty
brew
shows
the
alcohol
a
little
lots
of
sweetness
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
good
big
of
yeast
and
malt
backbone
the
peppery
spice
adds
some
balance
amongst
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
head
which
i
had
to
sip
from
the
top
to
prevent
overflow
due
to
my
bad
pour
it
has
a
very
sweet
malt
and
fruit
scent
which
leans
toward
plantains
it
has
a
spicy
pepper
yet
sweet
citrus
taste
with
a
generous
amount
of
yeast
present
it
is
incredibly
smooth
refreshing
and
could
be
an
everyday
beer
for
me
i
allow
my
wife
to
take
a
sip
from
each
of
my
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
in
which
she
gave
a
nod
of
approval
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
head
and
thought
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
watery
but
overall
a
pretty
good
choice
overall
a
great
bspa
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
but
its
still
definitely
one
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
is
new
to
belgians
d
for
me
not
so
much
a
everyday
beer
but
the
next
time
i
go
to
the
beach
i
may
grab
a
couple
of
these
drinkability
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
beer
d
a
powerful
brew
at
8
5
abv
but
so
solid
drinking
a
really
nice
blend
of
fruity
malts
spicy
hops
and
the
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
palate
complex
very
drinkable
very
tasty
just
might
make
you
see
the
pink
elephant
after
a
few
had
on
tap
at
bier
markt
in
toronto
poured
into
branded
delirium
tulip
pale
orange
colour
with
nice
white
head
with
great
lacing
and
retention
smell
of
belgian
yeast
with
a
mild
fruitiness
and
bread
with
some
spices
taste
has
mild
bitterness
but
very
crisp
i
seemed
to
get
a
bit
tired
of
drinking
this
by
the
end
of
the
glass
but
i
still
did
have
a
couple
because
friends
didnt
like
this
and
i
couldnt
let
it
go
to
waste
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
abv
can
easily
get
away
from
you
if
youre
not
paying
attention
high
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
somewhat
understated
flavor
with
prominent
banana
pepper
and
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
dry
finish
very
light
dry
and
easydrinking
the
abv
is
wellmasked
and
can
really
sneak
up
on
you
pours
a
straw
yellow
mixed
with
orange
hue
into
a
tasting
glass
head
retention
is
pretty
good
it
never
recedes
to
a
collar
bubbles
are
always
present
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
light
pear
peach
character
taste
is
really
nice
pear
with
pepper
and
some
other
fruit
in
here
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
viscous
nit
as
watery
as
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
will
definitely
be
able
to
finish
the
bomber
by
myself
dthe
alcohol
is
noticeable
as
a
warming
effect
and
not
really
in
the
flavor
but
for
me
its
not
a
style
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
because
my
mouth
becomes
drier
as
the
bottle
becomes
empty
notes
annoyed
with
the
packaging
isnt
the
painted
bottle
enough
do
you
really
need
foil
too
the
bottles
are
much
more
complex
than
the
draft
but
still
its
not
that
exciting
of
a
beer
lots
of
gimmick
a
decent
beer
high
scores
and
lots
of
demand
not
my
favorite
bpa
a
very
good
bspa
not
the
best
ive
had
but
good
id
get
it
in
a
bar
but
i
doubt
ill
spring
for
another
bottle
maybe
its
better
in
its
own
pink
elephant
glass
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
d
look
this
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
better
ones
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
from
a
lot
of
different
people
and
let
me
tell
you
straight
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
this
is
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
ive
ever
bought
if
youre
really
that
interested
pick
one
up
while
it
will
likely
disappoint
it
wont
let
you
down
delirium
nocturnum
is
a
more
interesting
and
i
feel
a
more
rewarding
experience
than
this
belgian
brew
an
easy
drinking
brew
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
for
me
notes
i
didnt
have
it
with
food
but
i
think
this
would
go
much
better
with
food
d
really
drinkable
beer
a
great
way
to
finish
an
evening
the
beer
tasted
nice
but
nothing
great
the
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
the
apple
hangs
on
very
little
of
the
belgian
funk
plays
in
the
palate
which
i
find
incredibly
disappointing
carbonation
is
ok
biting
but
lower
than
i
expected
for
what
i
know
of
the
style
very
drinkable
with
none
of
the
higher
abv
coming
through
but
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
dway
too
high
for
a
brew
with
an
8
5abv
tastytasty
and
tasty
i
have
tasted
this
before
and
i
remember
it
being
much
more
carbonated
and
a
bit
lighterfluffier
i
guess
this
may
just
be
a
slightly
flattened
bottle
still
quite
tasty
though
and
a
good
complement
to
its
cousin
bspa
duvel
perfect
brew
future
bottles
were
better
received
in
closing
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
the
world
i
really
enjoy
it
each
and
every
time
i
get
the
chance
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
peace
out
beer
freaks
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
would
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
before
falling
over
in
my
chair
d
rather
drinkable
and
i
would
drink
more
if
the
price
per
bottle
wasnt
so
damn
high
here
in
australia
medium
body
despite
the
volume
of
alcohol
relatively
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
i
fear
that
my
ratings
are
indicative
of
my
mild
dislike
for
the
belgian
style
much
in
the
same
way
that
i
no
longer
enjoy
watching
the
barca
style
that
spains
national
team
inherited
from
holland
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
because
of
its
quality
and
reputation
but
i
will
probably
never
buy
a
second
bottle
unless
tasting
with
those
who
have
not
yet
sampled
this
brew
d
i
only
had
the
one
i
couldnt
bear
the
strong
metallic
flavor
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
on
tap
i
do
remember
preferring
the
nocturnum
to
this
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
bad
ill
hafta
pick
up
a
bottle
and
try
it
again
d
not
quite
as
splendid
as
its
cousin
duvel
but
a
great
bspa
nonetheless
d
great
all
the
way
through
they
price
is
rather
unappealing
but
it
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
others
this
would
be
outstanding
with
a
perfectly
prepared
steak
i
get
hungry
at
the
thought
of
it
this
is
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
the
best
damned
bubblegum
ive
ever
had
if
delirium
tremens
were
less
expensive
it
would
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
lighter
beers
with
which
to
make
a
delicious
drinking
session
overall
this
is
a
fairly
light
dry
and
flavorful
beer
it
has
a
decent
complexity
and
is
fairly
easy
drinking
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
first
sip
is
yummy
big
collection
of
flavors
spicy
cloves
rum
soaked
pears
crisp
apples
plus
a
whole
lot
more
a
great
complex
ale
that
i
need
to
have
a
lot
more
so
i
can
discover
even
more
flavors
most
people
are
very
surprised
when
tasting
this
pale
ale
complex
flavoring
is
more
what
one
would
expect
from
much
darker
ales
very
pleasant
combination
of
sweet
pear
and
nectarine
and
a
cinnamonnutmeg
spiciness
very
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
banana
cream
pie
float
anyone
this
beer
is
simply
fantastic
and
consistent
and
can
be
enjoyed
by
itself
or
with
a
wide
array
of
food
the
packaging
is
one
of
a
kind
and
really
makes
a
statement
about
the
quality
you
are
getting
the
aroma
is
like
smelling
a
freshly
baked
banana
cream
pie
in
a
bake
shop
with
hints
of
vanilla
yeast
and
orange
it
tastes
nothing
like
it
looks
as
you
may
be
expecting
a
light
flavor
the
flavor
is
rich
velvety
and
well
balanced
i
imagined
frying
bananas
and
a
sprinkling
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
but
having
a
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
with
notes
of
a
sourdough
starter
even
though
this
beer
is
on
the
higher
medium
body
scale
it
is
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
long
creamy
and
leaves
the
banana
flavor
around
for
a
while
my
favorite
paring
with
this
was
a
seared
foie
gras
brioche
and
bananaapple
chutney
overall
see
drinkability
definitely
experience
this
beer
taste
is
sweet
and
sharp
not
much
bite
from
the
alcohol
which
is
surprising
given
the
strength
but
its
nice
this
has
crazy
low
gravity
its
amazing
very
clean
finish
with
a
light
hoppiness
this
is
excellent
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
extra
large
white
fluffy
head
good
lacing
and
lively
carbonation
lots
of
lacing
remains
as
the
head
quickly
recedes
lots
of
spices
in
the
aroma
same
in
the
taste
with
some
citrus
lemony
hints
light
body
and
thin
slick
texture
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
finishes
sweet
and
tart
with
a
light
bitterness
moderately
sweet
with
long
flavor
duration
excellent
brew
overall
very
good
beer
sweet
and
dry
drinkable
all
around
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
be
careful

will
sneak
up
on
you
poured
a
golden
straw
in
color
d
i
love
this
beer
would
definetly
buy
again
it
has
cream
soda
tastes
along
with
white
raisins
it
is
a
strange
taste
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
darker
beer
than
it
looks
beer
has
a
medium
to
light
body
and
a
late
breadiness
to
it
no
real
carbonation
in
mouth
but
an
overall
smooth
mouthfeel
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
that
builds
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
some
citrusy
spicy
notes
in
there
overall
its
pretty
good
ive
had
it
several
times
and
i
would
have
it
again
this
one
does
a
good
job
of
winning
me
over
to
the
tropical
fruits
of
wheatbeerstripels
although
this
is
listed
as
a
belgian
strong
ale
which
to
be
honest
have
had
difficult
appealing
to
me
recently
this
one
compares
favourably
to
la
fin
du
monde
from
memory
because
i
dont
find
it
as
cloyingly
sweet
i
think
thats
due
to
the
more
sulfuric
notes
in
the
nose
and
the
bitter
taste
overall
this
beer
is
utterly
fantastic
not
in
my
top
5
but
hovering
nicely
around
number
10
if
you
havent
had
it
go
get
it
drinkability
is
medium
tastes
great
and
goes
down
easy
but
the
abv
is
high
to
have
many
of
these
also
not
sure
id
want
to
have
more
than
2
in
a
row
due
to
the
sweet
and
sugary
taste
altogether
an
amazing
experience
cant
wait
to
share
with
others
deliriums
cafe
is
one
of
the
worlds
top
beer
bars
deliriums
pink
elephants
are
among
the
worlds
most
recognizable
beer
logos
but
the
delirium
beer
itself
doesnt
come
anywhere
close
to
ranking
as
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
although
its
popularity
is
largely
warranted
there
are
far
more
and
far
superior
belgian
ales
out
there
d
doesnt
hit
as
hard
as
nocturnum
did
for
me
which
is
odd
because
the
abv
is
the
same
still
the
taste
was
great
and
refreshingly
satisfying
one
at
a
time
is
enough
but
that
one
is
highly
enjoyable
d
doesnt
become
bitter
with
time
like
some
belgian
ales
ive
tried
like
piraat
you
just
dont
get
sick
of
this
beer
bottle
is
about
2
5
years
old
and
the
cork
reads
2008
upon
popping
of
the
cork
a
steady
stream
of
foam
comes
oozing
out
of
bottle
and
continues
for
several
minutes
until
i
finally
pour
the
glass
pour
yeilds
about
2
5
inches
of
white
creamy
head
which
recedes
into
a
solid
lacing
sitting
so
nicely
atop
this
golden
yellow
beer
lots
of
white
floaties
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
which
are
streaming
from
the
nucleation
point
of
my
claret
glass
carbonation
is
ridiculous
and
the
intense
stream
of
bubbles
have
continued
for
almost
five
minutes
always
swirling
about
the
floaters
almost
like
the
beer
is
dancing
for
me
very
imppressive
looking
beverage
aromas
wafting
up
at
me
are
sweet
honey
with
something
sour
and
malty
in
the
background
got
a
ever
so
slight
wift
of
sweet
alcohol
taste
is
very
light
for
the
abv
of
the
beer
and
carbonation
is
almost
prickly
but
still
creamy
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
tasting
honey
light
use
of
hops
small
bit
of
breadiness
and
maybe
almost
a
slight
pear
fruitiness
followed
imediately
by
a
sour
dry
but
somehow
still
wet
and
creamy
finish
not
sure
how
they
got
prickly
creamy
wet
and
dry
all
in
there
at
once
but
the
beer
is
very
complex
but
still
simple
at
the
same
time
very
easy
to
drink
and
will
definately
be
having
again
a
d
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
with
my
first
delirium
on
draft
the
yard
house
seems
to
have
gotten
the
carbonation
seriously
wrong
which
totally
changed
the
character
of
the
beer
it
went
from
one
of
my
bottled
favorites
for
its
balance
and
complexity
to
a
simple
beer
with
strong
apple
cider
notes
its
somewhat
odd
to
see
deposits
as
plentiful
as
in
this
beer
regardless
it
is
another
quality
bspa
and
due
to
its
unusual
appearance
in
both
bottle
and
liquid
its
well
worth
a
look
the
high
abv
means
you
shouldnt
take
down
too
many
bombers
of
this
brew
but
youll
want
to
surprised
to
see
grades
as
low
as
d
how
does
this
beer
fail
great
head
and
lacing
great
smells
fruitsmustiness
and
taste
which
changes
through
each
sip
and
as
you
drink
the
beer
overall
a
wonderful
beer
what
i
envision
when
i
think
about
belgian
beer
happy
to
have
a
glass
of
this
anytime
dan
excellent
beer
always
a
treat
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
delirium
tremens
used
to
be
a
real
staple
for
me
a
nice
but
not
particularly
exciting
bspa
given
that
its
normally
bottleconditioned
and
generally
somewhat
bland
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
on
tap
as
it
turned
out
the
beer
was
extremely
refreshing
with
a
very
solid
flavor
and
feel
while
i
have
lots
of
reasons
for
trying
this
beer
it
will
pair
well
with
contemplation
or
relaxation
just
as
well
as
a
medium
to
cut
fatty
foods
actually
this
is
a
great
accompaniment
for
dinner
too
i
was
hoping
this
would
rival
the
on
tap
version
not
to
be
sadly
have
had
it
on
tap
and
by
the
bottle
the
tap
version
much
better
than
the
already
great
bottled
tremmes
very
aromatic
and
frgrant
pours
almost
clear
very
drinkable
well
rounded
ale
with
very
fruity
and
floral
notes
which
linger
past
the
hoppy
bit
that
you
get
at
the
front
end
very
freshing
and
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
have
anytime
d
this
isnt
my
first
time
having
this
beer
but
its
the
first
review
of
it
and
im
disappointed
i
felt
it
was
much
better
before
so
i
dont
know
what
to
blame
it
on
maybe
the
taps
are
bad
the
atmosphere
was
too
cloudy
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
the
first
ive
had
of
the
two
main
deliriums
drinkable
in
that
its
pretty
tasty
and
a
goodlooker
but
the
alcohol
could
put
you
back
a
bit
after
a
few
this
is
something
ill
have
again
occasionally
but
certainly
wont
buy
in
bulk
mainly
for
the
price
not
bad
at
all
though
the
taste
has
a
spicy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
due
to
the
carbonation
has
some
corriander
flavor
finishing
with
a
citus
like
acidity
has
a
surprising
malt
aftertaste
great
beer
a
standard
in
my
fridge
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
tasty
belgian
strong
pale
ale
would
have
had
more
than
one
but
there
were
other
belgian
ales
i
had
to
try
panache
overall
this
was
dissappointing
i
like
pale
aleipas
but
this
one
seemed
flat
and
plain
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
much
better
ales
out
there
especially
at
this
high
abv
there
are
a
lot
of
very
good
ales
for
a
better
example
of
this
type
of
ale
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
recommend
russian
rivers
damnation
the
folks
at
rr
have
nailed
this
style
imo
d
extremely
smooth
for
the
high
abv
stands
up
great
by
itself
or
would
pair
nicely
with
cheese
and
fruit
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
aroma
was
great
along
with
a
taste
that
was
packed
with
a
mix
of
bold
flavors
and
the
balance
was
spot
on
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
enough
going
on
to
want
to
have
another
just
to
enjoy
it
all
over
again
had
this
on
tap
at
eulogy
bar
in
philly
poured
into
a
chalice
golden
yellow
with
god
retention
on
a
white
head
and
great
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
from
the
yeasts
earthy
and
uniquely
belgian
hops
taste
was
similar
fruity
then
dry
earthy
hops
hides
the
alcohol
well
very
drinkable
great
beer
d
a
good
beer
from
what
i
remember
when
there
is
not
tons
of
sediment
in
it
even
a
little
too
carbonated
than
i
remember
as
well
a
bad
bottle
nice
limpid
golden
beer
with
uniform
white
head
subsided
to
delicious
lacing
crisp
aroma
of
citrus
and
yeast
typical
belgian
taste
sweet
malt
fruits
and
honey
yeasts
again
in
collaboration
gave
an
excellent
result
very
drinkable
and
smooth
beer
sparkling
in
a
glass
was
ingested
gaily
in
a
moment
highly
recommended
d
outstanding
had
this
in
a
pint
size
glass
and
was
feeling
it
by
the
end
trouble
because
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
and
could
drink
this
any
day
and
in
for
any
season
d
nice
beer
that
drinks
above
average
d
while
it
is
strong
the
nothing
in
the
flavor
is
overpowering
ill
definitely
be
finishing
the
750
this
evening
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
unlike
some
other
bspas
ive
had
recently
were
it
not
for
the
abv
i
could
see
myself
pounding
back
several
of
these
in
an
evening
just
one
crept
up
on
me
great
stuff
d
just
about
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
that
i
can
drink
plenty
of
them
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ales
d
one
bottle
is
it
i
there
is
not
much
here
but
there
is
not
supposed
to
be
it
is
supposed
to
be
perfectly
crafted
i
feel
that
it
is
not
up
to
par
for
the
style
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
triple
than
a
strong
ale
kinda
tastes
like
it
did
not
fully
ferment
out
there
is
too
much
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
high
with
a
very
slight
sting
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
high
alcohol
level
and
this
is
a
fine
oneanddone
type
of
beer
to
enjoy
prior
to
or
during
a
meal
a
true
belgian
classic
and
one
of
the
best
of
a
style
that
can
often
be
too
bland
for
my
palate
drinkability
i
could
have
it
every
once
in
a
while
but
id
rather
have
a
duvel
or
st
sebastians
grand
reserve
d
this
is
a
good
brew
on
tap
not
spectacular
but
it
is
only
a
notch
below
notes
lots
of
different
fruits
that
mix
well
and
while
they
provide
sweetness
it
isnt
overly
cloying
drinkability
very
drinkable
could
easily
drink
several
overall
the
taste
is
a
little
too
mild
for
me
this
almost
comes
off
as
a
saison
d
excellent
pale
ale
would
love
to
have
more
in
the
future
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
but
probably
will
not
buy
it
on
my
own
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
a
real
treat
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
seems
to
have
a
little
extra
something
that
separates
itself
will
be
drinking
again
soon
mcs
d
very
rich
this
one
can
get
you
in
trouble
because
the
alcohol
is
masked
so
well
behind
the
sweetness
ive
very
happy
that
the
beer
was
as
awesome
as
the
bottle
the
pink
elephants
delivered
i
went
against
my
better
judgement
and
bought
a
big
bottle
of
this
beer
i
usually
have
no
one
to
share
with
and
i
rarely
will
drink
a
big
bottle
in
one
sitting
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
i
shouldve
bought
2
an
absolute
must
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
some
time
and
it
did
not
disappoint
the
volume
to
price
ratio
left
me
with
a
bitter
taste
in
my
wallet
though
so
i
doubt
ill
be
ordering
this
anytime
soon
but
never
the
less
a
decent
beer
mouthfeel
dry
medium
body
and
quite
carbonated
it
is
possible
to
have
on
too
many
of
these
d
smooth
and
somewhat
light
i
could
easily
put
away
a
whole
pint
of
this
in
a
night
masks
the
alcohol
pretty
good
once
i
was
able
to
fully
empty
the
contents
of
the
bottle
i
was
intrigued
by
the
cloudiness
and
copious
amount
of
bubbles
erupting
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
bit
of
citrus
to
it
and
an
interesting
sweetness
the
taste
was
like
a
combination
of
fruit
and
flowers
and
honey
complimented
by
a
mediumweight
body
that
was
delicious
and
extremely
satisfying
its
a
bit
pricey
per
bottle
but
it
is
just
an
amazing
beer
with
tons
of
character
i
love
it
this
is
a
great
beer
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
was
very
pleased
and
will
be
getting
again
also
will
now
have
to
try
the
other
deliriums
light
and
tingly
strong
carbonation
very
drinkable
especially
as
it
warms
what
is
most
impressive
is
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
comparable
to
duvel
but
id
say
duvel
is
more
carbonated
and
delirium
is
more
flavorful
same
flavors
yeast
bread
banana
clove
but
i
think
they
just
come
through
better
in
the
delirium
too
bad
is
so
much
more
expensive
than
duvel
overall
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
id
get
more
if
it
werent
so
costly
8
5
you
dont
taste
it
but
certainly
do
feel
it
packs
a
nice
punch
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
light
and
refreshing
to
drink
with
a
crisp
carbonation
that
really
fits
the
brew
and
is
reminiscent
of
dry
cider
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
at
the
price
in
the
states
it
may
be
worth
drinking
something
else
in
the
states
still
its
one
of
my
regulars
and
i
can
drink
it
often
great
beer
d
man
this
is
good
stuff
i
can
put
away
a
750ml
bottle
but
after
that
i
would
be
done
on
the
other
hand
if
i
were
inclined
i
could
session
this
at
a
bar
on
tap
eulogy
while
i
have
had
this
brew
a
few
times
in
the
past
this
is
my
first
review
this
brew
was
had
as
a
part
of
a
new
years
celebration
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
frothy
white
head
that
had
incredible
retention
that
left
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
pleasant
nice
pale
malt
spices
slightly
fruity
and
yeast
all
stick
out
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
even
better
nice
malt
character
fruit
flavors
apple
pear
that
play
well
with
everything
else
nice
spiciness
that
seems
to
really
highlight
clove
and
coriander
effervescent
finish
which
goes
well
really
a
nice
brew
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
having
very
drinkable
one
i
have
had
many
times
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
seek
out
an
alltime
classic
very
good
beer
but
i
have
to
admit
this
one
was
a
ton
better
on
tap
maybe
this
bottle
isnt
at
its
peak
for
freshness
either
still
a
really
good
belgian
wonderful
belgian
double
pale
ale
the
best
ive
ever
had
drinkability
great
taste
light
very
drinkable
even
though
it
is
a
strong
ale
its
easy
to
forget
that
d
a
great
belgian
sipper
this
brew
is
wellbalanced
and
has
a
good
flavor
profile
d
a
very
nice
beer
very
drinkable
but
imho
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
claim
of
best
beer
in
the
world
or
even
its
price
tag
i
actually
prefer
the
delirium
noel
to
the
tremens
a
bit
sweet
but
oherwise
quite
drinkable
although
i
am
a
bit
critical
of
this
beer
i
must
say
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
t
it
has
a
very
strong
lemony
taste
extremely
sweet
its
a
very
high
quality
beer
but
way
too
sweet
its
not
for
me
but
i
can
see
its
quality
overall
great
beer
try
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
id
submit
that
you
wouldnt
be
disappointed
in
anyway
whatsoever
id
really
like
to
see
how
this
beer
holds
up
to
aging
think
i
might
grab
a
bottle
and
try
it
out
for
you
all
a
couple
of
years
down
the
road
cheers
drinkability
a
drink
to
sip
for
sure
with
such
off
the
wall
flavors
and
the
decent
abv
this
drink
will
be
good
to
enjoy
with
dinner
overall
very
good
beer
i
can
see
why
some
people
are
in
love
with
it
drinkability
is
good
but
the
carbonation
slows
down
the
consumption
a
bit
in
my
opinion
drinkability
its
a
heavy
sort
of
creamy
so
yes
its
drinkable
because
the
taste
is
very
good
but
1
of
these
beers
is
good
enough
for
1
night
kudos
to
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
one
id
be
willing
to
drink
again
for
sure
highly
recommended
this
beer
has
to
be
drunk
cold
it
changes
all
attributes
as
it
warms
not
so
healthy
as
it
heats
up
so
drink
it
swiftly
verdict
delirium
tremens
is
a
highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
characterfilled
brew
brouwerij
huyghe
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite

abv
this
is
very
mild
and
drinkable
one
bottle
would
be
enough
because
of
the
sweetness
and
abv
worth
trying
but
would
not
be
in
my
regular
rotation
what
a
strange
brew
had
it
a
while
ago
but
cant
forget
it
poured
much
clearer
and
with
less
head
than
i
expected
smell
was
fruity
and
floral
taste
was
not
as
yeasty
as
i
like
as
far
as
belgians
go
but
the
amalgam
of
fruit
flavors
and
floralspice
hints
were
nice
this
beer
just
seems
a
bit
watery
to
me
but
that
being
said
it
is
verrry
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
gotta
love
the
bottle
drinkability
light
and
flavorful
strong
belgian
ale
that
is
a
great
sipper
but
probably
not
quite
worthy
of
the
voted
best
beer
in
the
world
status
they
tout
around
matchbox
capitol
hill810
oz
alcohol
is
masked
extremely
well
in
is
hardly
noticeable
on
the
palate
couple
that
with
the
lightness
in
body
due
to
the
carbonation
and
excellent
attenuation
and
this
beer
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
d
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
i
have
generally
skipped
it
lately
because
i
am
moving
out
of
the
bspa
style
but
this
is
a
good
reminder
of
what
im
missing
and
should
seek
out
again
d
ive
always
loved
this
beer
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
duvel
but
pretty
close
watch
out
for
the
abv
pours
a
clear
pale
blonde
color
with
a
very
thin
lacy
head
gives
off
a
subtle
fruity
aroma
the
body
is
very
light
with
high
carbonation
levels
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
vinous
and
is
moved
around
on
the
palate
by
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
final
kick
and
fizz
from
the
bubbles
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
gives
way
to
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruits
wheat
and
a
slight
floral
smell
the
smell
is
very
inviting
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
there
is
a
taste
of
wheat
with
some
light
fruits
apple
comes
through
the
most
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
but
not
stingy
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
considering
the
alcohol
content
it
is
close
to
great
but
not
there
d
this
beer
confused
the
hell
outta
me
floaties
pear
pink
elephants
interesting
brew
and
i
may
buy
it
again
if
i
got
the
hankerin
for
a
nice
belgian
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
had
it
before
and
didnt
think
quite
as
highly
of
it
as
i
do
now
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
shot
very
tasty
brew
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
it
overall
this
was
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
but
not
outstanding
to
me
ill
drink
it
again
but
for
the
price
ill
look
to
some
other
choices
first
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
2008
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
gold
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
and
also
has
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
pears
apples
peppery
spice
yeast
and
some
oranges
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
pears
peppery
spice
bananas
and
a
bit
of
grainbread
and
lemon
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
little
slick
and
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
but
it
has
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
decent
but
would
be
better
if
the
carbonation
was
lower
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
enough
brew
overall
drinks
like
adult
alcoholic
apple
juice
much
like
the
beer
version
of
a
hard
cider
should
be
available
in
box
form
straw
included
bonus
points
for
a
unique
mascot
and
bottle
design
d
very
refreshing
and
lower
abv
nice
d
while
this
beer
is
drinkable
it
is
rather
acidic
a
fairly
bitter
beer
overall
but
the
fruitiness
makes
it
tolerable
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
but
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
substance
and
spiciness
to
it
d
good
especially
with
the
high
abv
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
tasty
refreshing
a
nice
belgian
ale
good
beer
to
have
the
bottle
looks
great
the
label
dito
drinkability
a
quite
good
belgian
pale
ale
smooth
and
spice
like
a
wheat
but
with
the
body
and
flavor
of
a
pale
ale
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
notes
big
flavor
and
alot
of
alcohol
make
this
one
strong
brew
very
well
balanced
and
straight
to
the
point
this
beer
holds
its
weight
you
will
definitely
have
the
delirium
tremens
dt
the
next
morning
after
a
few
of
these
very
sippable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
drinkability
bspas
can
get
me
into
trouble
delirium
tremens
is
no
exception
d
as
the
988th
reviewer
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
there
is
anything
new
i
can
add
to
the
discussion
however
i
found
myself
not
being
terribly
impressed
with
this
right
out
of
the
gate
but
as
it
warmed
it
picked
up
a
lot
of
character
and
really
grew
on
me
theres
great
complexity
here
that
is
extremely
well
balanced
definitely
worth
a
revisit
down
the
road
wow
what
a
delicious
smell
in
the
bottle
smells
of
citrus
lemons
and
yeast
kind
of
like
a
lemon
drop
but
not
in
a
sweet
way
pours
to
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
a
big
head
that
is
real
foamy
taste
is
also
on
the
citrus
side
sweet
and
yeasty
only
very
slight
bitters
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
but
yet
very
thick
and
chewy
i
think
this
may
be
my
first
brew
of
this
particular
style
how
delicious
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
high
sg
in
the
heat
and
not
bog
down
at
all
the
abv
is
not
even
evident
more
than
it
is
obviously
adding
to
the
flavor
in
undertones
im
delirious
not
bad
but
for
me
a
one
time
experience
the
only
downside
is
the
price
tag
but
do
not
let
it
stop
you
it
is
well
worth
it
notes
a
certainly
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
i
will
definitely
order
again
mouthfeel
intensely
carbonated
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
for
my
taste
with
a
touch
of
harshness
from
the
alcohol
rich
in
body
a
big
yet
satisfying
beer
for
the
style
over
all
this
beer
is
a
pure
delight
to
drink
its
a
blend
of
so
many
different
tastes
that
its
got
to
be
in
a
class
all
its
own
this
beer
could
be
viewed
as
the
ultimate
example
of
a
belgian
ale
or
even
of
beer
itself
its
a
rollercoaster
ride
of
divine
tastes
all
rolled
into
one
glass
of
yellow
carbonated
liquid
its
special
d
super
drinkable
a
very
soild
strong
belgain
ale
overall
the
flavor
and
smell
was
great
and
really
spot
on
for
what
in
my
opinion
is
just
an
average
golden
belgian
ale
i
much
prefer
the
nocturnum
better
the
sheer
amount
of
sediment
turned
me
off
greatly
from
this
brew
i
dont
mind
bottle
conditioning
and
refermentation
but
not
at
the
price
of
having
a
full
ounce
of
multicolored
junk
floating
around
it
various
forms
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
though
the
label
stated
half
that
quantity
into
a
goblet
poured
a
hazy
golden
colour
with
lots
of
floaties
and
a
big
foamy
head
that
like
lasted
forever
the
smell
was
very
fruity
with
a
little
yeast
nose
too
the
best
part
was
the
lengthy
taste
begins
with
a
twangy
sweet
and
malty
note
that
after
a
while
changes
into
a
chikoo
sapotila
or
sapot
an
exotic
fruit
flavour
very
biscuit
like
leaves
the
mouth
very
moist
like
what
an
appetizer
will
do
optimum
caronation
works
itself
around
your
palate
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
here
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
keep
savouring
throughout
the
evening
into
the
night
and
later
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
high
as
it
is
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
a
clear
golden
pour
with
a
medium
sized
frothy
white
head
that
lasted
forever
lots
of
yeast
chunks
floating
around
with
a
huge
jet
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
lots
of
lacing
and
sheeting
aroma
is
spicy
and
lightly
yeasty
lots
of
fruity
notes
pineapplelemonbanana
maybe

flavor
is
of

some
grassy
hops
with
nice

quite
yeasty

a

with
some
flashes

a

such
a

no

well
crafted
and
enjoyable
i
would
drink
this
all
night
if
given
the
opportunity
unfortunately
i
cant
afford
to
the
alcohol
is
lightly
detected
in
the
flavor
area
its
easily
felt
though
somewhat
surprising
at
8
5abv
while
it
is
quite
tasty
it
would
get
you
messed
up
fairly
quickly
drinkability
very
good
its
complex
and
unique
yet
true
to
style
its
not
cloying
yet
masks
the
alcohol
very
well
very
interesting
and
invites
for
more
would
have
again
over
most
belgian
strong
pale
very
drinkable
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
even
the
full
750ml
bottle
is
possible
once
you
get
going
try
it
if
you
can
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
poured
a
light
amber
with
some
floaties
and
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
fresh
sour
apples
the
taste
was
sweetsour
with
carbonation
bubbling
all
over
tongue
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
reasonably
good
for
an
8
50
abv
in
general
im
not
a
fan
but
admittedly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
any
of
the
belgians
nocturnum
was
better
as
a
bsda
d
very
easy
to
drink
especially
considering
the
abv
wish
i
liked
them
more
espcially
since
they
come
in
that
great
glass
with
the
pink
elephants
unfortunately
just
not
a
fan
of
the
sytle
d
scary
good
could
drink
many
of
these
8
5
nah
seems
lighter
than
that
a
lot
like
duvel
where
one
is
just
not
enough
can
drink
23
and
still
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
the
stong
suit
of
this
beer
d
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
i
can
drink
this
often
and
for
a
long
time
not
quite
a
session
beer
however
pale
gold
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
which
leaves
a
small
lace
has
poor
retention
smells
of
bananas
pears
citrus
and
spices
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
and
is
sweet
and
dry
nice
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
drinkability
is
good
and
i
would
have
this
again
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
is
goodi
probably
would
not
buy
it
for
myself
alone
again
but
i
would
happily
buy
it
for
a
group
and
i
would
enjoy
drinking
it
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
they
do
down
so
easily
and
a
session
is
easy
to
do
with
this
beer
the
higher
abv
may
catch
up
to
you
eventually
but
its
so
good
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
filling
that
you
may
not
care
i
know
i
dont
this
is
a
drinkable
strong
pale
ale
watch
out
for
the
abv
the
slimy
chunky
sediment
pours
a
typical
straw
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
not
promising
though
it
is
quite
bubbly
fortunately
the
appearance
is
this
beers
weakest
point
the
inviting
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
firm
fruity
undertone
that
is
mainly
citrus
and
has
just
a
hint
of
banana
flavor
is
a
delight
malty
and
yeasty
with
strong
fruity
tones
texture
is
wonderfully
tingly
more
like
champagne
than
beer
so
it
fairly
dances
on
the
tongue
and
on
its
way
down
the
pipes
strongly
recommended
a
pale
golden
to
a
slightly
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
white
colored
head
the
yeasty
scent
plucks
at
the
nose
at
the
front
of
the
aroma
this
soon
followed
by
a
coriander
fragrance
mixing
with
a
bread
aroma
it
all
ends
with
a
citrus
scent
mostly
of
orange
a
slightly
hoppy
start
to
the
taste
at
the
beginning
that
brings
strong
earthiness
that
is
trailed
by
yeasty
esters
bringing
fruity
flavors
mostly
of
pear
a
hearty
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
chewy
in
the
front
then
it
gradually
thins
out
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
the
palate
it
all
finishes
with
a
strong
crispness
that
would
be
associated
with
a
lager
the
strong
belgian
characteristics
that
one
wants
from
this
beer
along
with
the
extra
kick
of
hops
and
the
crisp
finish
make
this
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
reduces
down
to
a
regular
size
head
the
smell
has
plenty
of
citrus
some
yeast
notes
some
fruit
smells
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
starts
with
a
citrus
yeast
flavor
moves
to
the
fruity
and
finishes
with
some
alcohol
tones
with
the
tones
staying
throughout
the
aftertaste
this
has
a
nice
crisp
light
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
great
flavor
balance
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
but
the
abv
or
aftertaste
might
get
old
soon
a
beer
that
definitely
should
be
checked
out
d
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
is
champagne
of
beers
it
is
like
champagne
but
in
beer
form
everything
about
it
is
great
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
and
not
because
it
was
free
it
is
a
very
solid
belgian
beer
staple
a
must
have
d
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
strong
belgian
ales
very
refreshing
and
lively
and
worryingly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
if
you
havent
already
this
is
one
that
should
be
added
to
your
to
try
list
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
bspa
that
rivals
duvel
without
question
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
this
on
tap
and
it
did
not
disappoint
one
bit
thanks
cah
and
gary
well
done
very
interested
in
comparing
this
with
my
duvel
waiting
in
the
fridge
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
but
a
little
too
overcarbonated
pretty
good
stuff
all
around
but
somewhat
sweeter
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
style
i
had
no
problems
finishing
off
the
bottle
but
not
sure
this
iwould
be
one
id
quickly
reach
for
again
given
the
alternatives
to
choose
from
alcohol
not
very
noticeable
and
an
overall
interesting
take
on
the
style
d
perfect
i
cant
imagine
a
perfect
day
of
drinking
beer
and
not
thinking
of
my
numerous
trips
to
belgium
id
plan
entire
trips
to
europe
just
to
enjoy
this
at
the
source
its
a
lifechanging
experience
i
highly
doubt
ill
ever
rate
another
beer
in
my
life
as
highly
though
not
my
favorite
style
of
brew
i
really
didnt
mind
this
one
at
all
and
it
was
a
good
one
to
clean
the
palate
off
with
to
have
some
more
hoppy
beers
afterwards
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
strong
belgian
could
give
duvel
a
run
for
its
money
as
the
sneakiest
of
beers
this
goes
down
easy
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
sneaks
up
quickly
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
better
than
average
but
drinkability
is
solid
these
go
down
very
well
given
the
higher
alcohol
content
d
very
easy
to
drink
which
makes
it
perfect
for
summer
overall
obviously
i
enjoyed
this
beer
highly
recommend
it
will
try
again
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
one
and
as
always
its
solid
good
stuff
poured
ontap
into
a
dt
snifter
the
beer
follows
most
of
its
characteristics
found
when
poured
from
the
bottle
its
mild
and
smooth
while
having
enough
interesting
qualties
to
the
flavor
to
keep
each
sip
enjoyable
fruity
belgian
pale
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
estery
and
acetaldehyde
notes
in
the
flavor
just
as
from
the
bottle
the
mouth
is
fullbodied
for
a
pale
not
watery
and
with
crisp
carbonation
strawlike
color
with
foamy
head
easily
drinkable
you
could
definitely
have
nothing
but
dt
all
night
and
barring
the
quick
intoxication
not
wind
up
feeling
too
full
or
put
off
by
sweetnessspiceanything
in
the
flavor
i
dont
know
im
not
that
impressed
the
malts
are
sour
and
any
of
the
good
sugar
taste
is
hidden
and
its
very
highly
carbonated
i
love
their
brew
pub
in
brussels
though
conclusion
good
example
of
the
style
always
a
classic
overall
belgians
make
mediocre
beer
too
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
there
wasnt
one
part
of
this
beer
i
was
impressed
with
though
you
could
probably
get
into
some
trouble
because
you
can
slam
it
back
pretty
easily
i
imagine
this
is
what
belgian
college
kids
play
beirut
with
sweet
bottle
though
it
tastes
good
but
nothing
special
its
a
strong
ale
you
can
drink
kinda
like
duvel
while
i
dont
really
enjoy
this
its
obviously
a
respectable
beer
and
in
spite
of
its
heavy
flavour
and
character
i
detect
a
lot
of
fine
subtle
touches
throughout
the
palate
its
very
meticulous
even
though
the
end
result
doesnt
agree
with
me
much
d
fairly
high
with
respect
to
the
alcohol
content
a
750
is
a
tall
order
but
delicious
split
with
a
friend
to
have
a
good
time
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
not
my
favorite
but
its
worthy
of
being
a
staple
belgian
beer
this
brew
is
well
balanced
and
complex
with
lots
of
different
angles
of
character
d
this
was
actually
the
beer
that
brought
me
into
the
craft
world
i
was
attending
a
law
school
function
at
brasserie
beck
and
this
was
one
of
the
beers
available
it
inspired
me
to
look
into
other
belgians
and
from
there
i
moved
into
the
american
craft
scene
so
it
definitely
has
nostalgic
value
for
me
it
still
holds
up
fairly
well
in
its
own
right
but
theres
a
ton
of
other
belgians
id
have
before
it
mfd
good
body
nothing
special
though
the
carbonation
quickly
fades
from
its
former
abundant
self
perhaps
a
bit
thin
in
body
though
debatable
was
a
lot
more
appetizing
when
much
colder
poured
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
to
about
12finger
size
body
was
cloudy
and
dark
yellow
with
lots
of
particles
some
quite
large
floating
around
high
carbonation
great
aroma
heavy
yeast
with
some
citrus
in
there
as
well
medium
body
on
the
palate
slightly
creamy
and
very
fizzy
flavor
is
initially
sweet
and
slightly
acidic
and
finishes
with
a
longlasting
alcohol
taste
that
causes
some
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
very
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
but
still
damned
impressive
this
is
very
drinkable
the
flavor
was
much
like
duvel
with
a
few
differences
the
taste
was
hops
and
citrus
a
rather
dry
finish
but
in
a
good
way
the
mouth
feel
is
not
as
good
as
i
expected
with
not
quite
enough
carbonation
at
least
for
what
i
expect
the
beer
is
strong
yet
very
drinkable
my
kids
got
to
go
to
the
bar
where
they
brew
this
stuff
i
am
now
jealous
a
far
above
average
example
of
the
style
my
girlfriend
swears
this
beer
makes
her
delirious
i
think
it
makes
me
drunk
pours
a
nice
gold
with
low
carbonation
and
1
12
finger
head
oakey
scents
very
smooth
almost
watery
typical
sweet
belgian
alcohol
taste
but
not
too
strong
ive
had
the
bottle
which
was
much
better
how
sweet
it
is
just
came
on
and
the
beer
is
tasting
better
feels
so
fine
m
d
a
richer
medium
body
touch
of
dryness
on
the
finish
but
its
right
on
the
back
i
find
slightly
syrupy
until
that
point
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
im
kinda
surprised
that
it
took
so
long
to
get
into
this
one
but
i
suppose
late
is
better
than
never
an
enjoyable
brew
eventually
ill
be
back
for
more
really
enjoyed
this
not
my
favourite
kind
of
style
but
i
loved
this
one
all
the
same
i
truly
do
hope
that
this
was
a
bad
bottle
because
this
was
seriously
a
joke
ludachris
if
you
are
reading
this
im
going
to
take
a
picture
of
the
beer
just
to
show
you
what
i
mean
ive
never
had
a
beer
so
highly
rated
on
ba
perform
so
poorly
d
great
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
even
with
a
considerable
alcohol
content
notes
good
level
of
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
a
tasty
beer
that
might
be
in
my
top
10
d
this
is
a
really
good
brew
even
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
beer
pours
up
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
lingers
the
rich
gold
color
is
true
to
style
the
aroma
is
lemon
and
orange
zest
clove
maybe
some
warm
banana
notes
banana
bread
the
taste
is
honeysuckle
clove
and
a
citrus
finish
all
balanced
by
the
sweetness
of
light
malt
the
beer
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
light
and
smooth
without
being
watery
i
picked
this
beer
up
on
a
lark
and
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
with
what
i
discovered
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
large
long
lasting
white
head
sweet
belgian
yeasty
nose
lots
of
bubblegum
with
some
mild
vanilla
notes
and
a
small
touch
of
bitterness
quality
malt
character
with
a
semi
sour
green
apple
note
ive
noticed
that
the
tremens
doesnt
have
the
sharp
spice
character
normally
associated
with
tripels
round
and
smooth
with
almost
no
alcohol
presence
lots
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
classic
without
a
doubt
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
drink
though
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
no
way
in
hell
am
i
ever
paying
8
50
for
a
330ml
bottle
again
price
at
spikes
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
another
one
of
these
elsewhere
at
some
point
future
outlook
very
good
stuff
to
be
sure
but
considering
the
hefty
price
i
might
stick
to
other
well
regarded
lower
cost
alternatives
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
quite
drinkable
especially
given
the
abv
if
i
didnt
know
better
which
i
dont
always
id
imagine
throwing
back
more
than
one
and
then
some
hijinx
or
mayhem
would
ensue
mouthfeel
pretty
sharp
carbonation
with
a
light
body
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
straw
color
slightly
hazy
and
heavy
on
sediment
throughout
the
whole
beer
a
two
and
a
half
finger
of
sudsy
head
on
top
great
retention
with
spotty
lacing
nose
is
of
belgian
yeast
clove
orange
lemon
and
a
touch
of
banana
taste
is
of
a
clove
and
corriander
spices
at
first
slightly
bready
in
the
middle
and
banana
in
the
finish
leaving
a
slightly
sweet
banana
fruity
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lighter
to
medium
body
decent
carbonation
slightly
creamy
at
first
with
a
dryer
crisp
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
silky
beige
head
nose
has
caramel
tropical
fruits
peppery
alcohol
and
herbal
yeast
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
mellow
side
well
balanced
beer
just
expected
more
from
the
nose
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
good
stuff
from
delerium
d
pretty
good
the
abv
and
alcohol
taste
hold
this
one
back
a
little
but
definitely
a
good
belgian
i
would
reach
for
an
equivalently
priced
duvel
though
tthis
is
pretty
drinkable
at
8
7
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
fits
in
well
with
the
flavour
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
they
were
free
im
not
sure
if
ill
be
paying
for
any
more
at
the
going
rate
here
in
montreal
there
are
too
many
better
less
expensive
beers
to
be
had
while
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
it
didnt
blow
me
away
overall
a
complex
and
very
interesting
beer
the
alcohol
is
reasonably
well
disguised
proving
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
thumbs
up
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
nearly
endless
finished
with
malt
banana
stone
fruit
and
oranges
and
white
bread
and
yeast
all
in
all
a
typical
belgian
kicked
up
a
big
notch
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
on
tap
if
you
find
it
complex
flavor
long
finish
the
hops
and
bitterness
were
a
delightful
surprise
this
is
a
solid
a
straw
colored
beer
forms
a
2
finger
snow
white
head
which
holds
for
several
minutes
ample
carbonation
rages
inside
the
brew
brew
smells
of
yeast
apples
ginger
and
spices
taste
is
citrus
based
and
mild
alcohol
well
masked
overall
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
mild
hop
presence
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
beer
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into

gentle
pour

huge
fizzy

a

golden
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
i
am
used
to
seeing
a
bit
more
sediment
floating
around
my
delirium
tremens
but
this
particular
bottle
is
a
bit
more
clear
nicely
balanced
aroma
citrus
fruit
spice
and
hops
taste
is
much
the
same
spice
and
fruit
up
front
pear
and
apple
and
i
get
a
hint
of
grapefruit
as
well
maybe
i
am
drinking
it
wrong
faint
hint
of
alcohol
a
touch
of
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
end
dry
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
drinks
down
dangerously
easy
ive
had
this
before
before
ill
have
this
beer
again
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
tm
the
palate
provides
a
nice
bite
complemented
well
by
the
body
the
medium
with
high
carbonation
apple
banana
and
pear
with
dash
of
black
pepper
the
carbonation
with
the
pepper
is
almost
over

oz

golden

afloat
mostly
clear
with
sizeable
initial
head
mostly
diminishing
with
moderate

remaining
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
with
citrus
notes
id
agree
with
the
mild
and
sweet
touch
to
this
beer
alcohol
mostly
hidden
more
noticeable
on
front
end
than
the
back
with
slight
bitter
finish
a
very
enjoyable
brew
cheers
to
the
belgians
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
mainly
because
its
heavy
on
the
lemon
and
pear
flavors
which
are
enhanced
by
a
healthy
degree
of
spice
the
finish
comes
in
two
stages
when
the
initial
hit
of
hops
gives
way
to
a
strong
alcohol
presence
d
fairly
easy
for
an
8
5
i
drank
the
entire
25
oz
bottle
with
no
food
no
problem
authentic
fresh
belgian
beer
brought
straight
from
the
source
on
our
spring
break
just
two
weeks
ago
what
a
treat
pours
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
some
chunks
in
the
glass
not
sure
what
it
is
but
well
see
good
one
finger
white
head
smell
very
fruity
and
sweet
pears
apples
honey
pretty
interesting
taste
it
is
sweet
and
it
is
fruity
i
like
it
but
this
is
not
even
close
to
what
i
expected
lemon
pears
some
spices
malts
cant
find
any
hops
in
there
its
weird
i
do
like
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
strange
one
it
is
somewhat
balanced
rich
it
is
kinda
smooth
and
it
is
fairly
drinkable
ill
make
sure
i
give
it
another
try
the
appearance
had
a
huge
head
that
lasted
forever
the
color
is
a
hazy
gold
with
massive
amounts
of
chunky
sediment
floating
around
tons
of
lacing
reveal
themselves
with
each
sip
very
appealing
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
banana
metallic
copper
and
light
sweet
malt
distinctive
belgian
aroma
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
not
too
much
of
one
thing
perfect
carbonation
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
somewhat
sweet
with
an
abv
that
is
wellhidden
i
cant
believe
it
is
9
because
i
can
barely
taste
any
alcohol
would
like
to
see
more
hop
flavor
overall
a
must
try
note
my
local
24
hour
store
got
a
few
cases
of
these
in
and
didnt
know
the
pricing
on
them
so
i
paid
pretty
much
1
75
per
12
oz
bottle
they
ussually
only
have
marco
brews
im
glad
good
beer
is
becoming
more
popular
drinkability
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
and
i
can
see
having
another
in
the
future
but
with
this
abv
a
single
beer
is
enough
for
one
sitting
even
with
a
meal
overall
a
great
well
balanced
begian
strong
ale
the
only
downside
for
me
was
the
amount
of
sediment
that
poured
out
besides
that
i
wish
this
puppy
was
available
down
where
i
lived
highly
recommended
drinkability
pretty
good
since
it
has
a
relatively
high
abv
good
mouthfeel
great
taste
recommended
final
thoughts
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
a
damn
fine
one
great
to
enjoy
with
friends
give
it
a
try
di
enjoyed
the
tremens
though
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
the
750ml
bottles
in
an
evening
d
extremely
drinkable
once
youve
sat
the
beer
down
for
12
min
you
are
quickly
temped
to
take
another
sip
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
want
one
right
now
and
its
947
in
the
morning
imo
better
than
the
nocturnom
although
completely
diff
styles
drinkablitity
you
might
think
this
day
is
like
any
other
but
this
day
was
unique
although
familar
its
well
worth
enjoying
to
the
fullist
cheers
i
enjoyed
this
but
will
probably
try
it
in
a
tulip
glass
tomorrow
another
solid
bspa
that
falls
just
short
of
duvel
for
me
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
stong
the
abv
is
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
easy
to
drink
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
id
go
back
for
another
taste
is
moderate
of
malts
slightly
tart
but
pleasant
all
the
way
through
none
of
the
lager
notes
present
in
duvel
and
not
as
gummy
sweet
this
is
a
superior
beer
to
duvel
yet
superior
is
a
relative
term
here
offers
a
nice
feel
that
maintains
well
throughout
the
glass
and
improves
with
a
bit
of
warming
yet
doesnt
diminish
too
much
even
after
30
minutes
of
air
interesting
enough
to
seek
out
in
the
bottle
but
not
likely
to
stand
up
to
some
nonbelgian
versions
oddly
d
supringly
great
with
such
a
high
abv
i
had
2
of
these
drinkability
too
extreme
on
the
sweetfruity
side
for
me
but
excellent
for
the
style
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
easily
considering
the
abv
pretty
solid
but
then
again
so
are
the
other
deliriums
i
get
the
pink
elephants
on
the
label
but
whats
the
significance
of
the
pimpstrutting
alligators
and
ballbalancing
chinese
dragons
heavily
carbonated
as
expected
contributing
to
the
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
light
heat
on
the
palate
cloudy
pale
yellow
beer
that
has
a
thick
billowing
head
that
slowly
fades
aroma
is
fruity
and
spicy
taste
is
once
again
fruitspicysugar
cane
and
alcohol
on
the
back
end
very
enjoyable
and
something
that
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
in
the
future
notes
if
i
was
inclined
to
blow
a
10spot
every
week
on
beer
id
go
back
for
delirium
tremens
until
i
was
to
find
something
better
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
recommend
it
for
your
enjoyment
drinkability
was
decent
the
beer
really
sneaks
around
the
back
and
hits
you
with
a
wellhidden
alcohol
smack
but
if
i
hadnt
been
sampling
several
different
beers
at
volo
i
would
have
definitely
gone
back
for
another
delirium
drinkability
is
very
high
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
this
brew
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
bit
roughly
carbonated
it
finishes
crisp
and
somewhat
dry
the
taste
is
within
range
of
the
aroma
with
slight
spice
yeast
and
fruitiness
to
it
the
only
disparity
in
the
taste
that
i
noticed
was
some
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
brew
worth
trying
once
but
nothing
special
a
very
good
trappist
ale
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
beer
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
it
is
ripe
with
fermentation
as
well
packing
a
solid
8
5
that
is
well
hidden
this
is
not
quite
as
good
as
foret
but
still
a
very
good
drink
i
taste
a
whole
lot
of
yeast
it
almost
tastes
a
bit
like
rye
bread
which
is
a
good
thing
d
i
could
take
my
time
with
a
bottle
of
this
and
i
dont
think
youd
ever
need
more
than
two
but
with
how
the
flavors
pull
through
with
warming
its
good
to
take
time
and
enjoy
while
other
down
a
sixer
two
bottles
of
this
would
outlast
six
of
most
brews
d
the
light
and
crisp
character
lends
itself
to
good
drinkability
even
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
can
be
sneaky
for
sure
ive
seen
this
beer
around
many
times
and
i
have
not
checked
it
out
until
now
thanks
bif
educator
i
am
a
belgian
greenhorn
still
training
my
palate
and
have
realized
that
i
enjoy
the
strong
pales
this
one
being
the
reinforcer
i
look
forward
to
purchasing
some
soon
4
5
m4

d
softly
spritzy
fizziness
remains
on
the
palate
against
a
full
body
pretty
quiet
flavour
profile
and
wellhidden
alc
this
tripel
is
consistently
dry
spicy
and
bitter
leaving
fruit
esters
and
maltiness
all
behind
although
it
is
not
as
colourful
complex
and
delicious
as
some
of
its
opposite
numbers
this
beer
rates
well
in
my
book
for
being
a
bitter
example
that
i
really
enjoy
d
yum
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
but
the
bottle
kicks
ass
pours
a
golden
somewhat
cloudy
colored
body
fizzy
with
a
white
head
small
but
it
has
good
lacing
creaminess
has
a
very
floral
sweet
dark
fruity
aroma
some
spices
too
spices
and
floral
tasting
a
light
taste
some
sediment
in
bottom
if
youve
never
had
a
trappist
ale
from
belgium
and
arent
able
to
find
a
decent
one
in
your
area
you
should
at
least
pick
up
some
of
this
delirium
tremens
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
what
a
belgian
beer
can
taste
like
this
isnt
officially
classified
as
a
tripel
but
its
very
similar
as
it
is
a
strong
ale
9
and
its
a
pale
ale
well
rounded
flavor
strong
alcohol
and
overall
a
nice
beer
to
relax
with
or
to
enjoy
on
a
special
occasion
just
dont
drink
it
too
cold
or
at
room
temperature
belgians
like
this
do
best
at
cellar
temperature
and
in
a
gobletshaped
glass
trust
me
try
it
yourself
this
is
good
but
for
11
per
bottle
i
cant
have
it
all
the
time
a
great
occasional
treat
overall
a
rather
tasty
bspa
porters
never
ceases
to
impress
me
with
the
freshness
and
variety
of
their
beers
this
is
a
big
big
beer
not
for
the
novice
i
ordered
up
a
pint
at
the
cck
and
bull
in
glendale
oh
thinking
it
was
4pint
like
the
rest
of
the
menu
i
selected
the
funnylooking
tap
with
elephants
on
it
the
bartender
hands
me
the
brew
allows
me
to
sip
it
and
tells
me
it
is
the
only
beer
not
on
happy
hour
she
goes
on
to
tell
me
this
one
will
cost
me
8pint
holy
crap
oh
well
it
was
sorta
worth
it
it
had
a
huge
glowingwhite
head
the
smell
was
piny
citrusy
the
taste
out
of
this
world
my
buddies
and
i
all
tasted
fruit
big
big
fruit
like
apples
an
melon
the
crisp
finish
leaves
you
longing
for
another
draw
from
the
glass
nothing
like
a
head
full
of
delirium
the
abv
tips
the
charts
if
you
see
this
beer
anywhere
buy
it
it
will
be
worth
the
extra
cheddar
you
will
plunk
down
to
get
it
d
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
this
bomber
not
too
sweet
not
too
thick
not
too
anything
except
alcohol
filled
i
was
a
bit
gone
after
finishing
22oz
of
this
8
5
brew
i
want
another
at
8
apiece
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
great
evening
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
dry
and
kind
of
crisp
the
9
alcohol
is
nice
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
is
reduced
to
a
nice
head
as
it
warms
it
smells
of
fruits
bananas
and
pears
and
spices
i
detect
a
clove
aftertaste
very
good
mouthfeel
is
strong
with
fruit
hops
and
spices
all
balancing
for
a
delicious
flavor
so
smooth
9
abv
drink
this
strong
ale
warmer
than
most
ales
as
it
warms
it
get
more
complex
and
better
its
17
99
a
4pak
but
worth
it
as
a
treat
every
couple
of
a
weeks
i
am
addicted
to
this
stuff
certainly
one
of
my
top
beers
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
what
feels
like
a
slight
acidity
to
the
brew
making
it
harder
to
drink
but
overall
im
very
impressed
dthe
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
i
mentioned
alcohol
is
not
very
present
and
taste
is
also
very
well
balanced
and
not
extreme
at
all
for
a
belgian
beer
honestly
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
light
meal
i
would
know
had
half
the
750
bottle
with
steamed
fish
touched
with
lemon
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
on
this
one
this
is
a
keeper
for
sure
if
only
it
wasnt
10
a
bottle
i
would
most
likely
drink
this
weekly
if
not
daily
at
any
rate
this
is
a
beer
i
will
be
returning
to
frequently
very
good
and
too
easy
to
drink
bombers
please
i
was
at
a
bar
with
an
enourmous
amount
of
beers
on
tap
nitrogen
tapped
even
and
the
tap
with
the
pink
elephant
called
delerium
tremens
really
caught
my
eye
im
pretty
sure
delerium
tremens
is
the
medical
term
for
the
shakes
that
drunks
get
the
bar
tender
said
it
was
his
favorite
beer
there
so
i
had
him
fetch
me
a
ten
ounce
goblet
of
the
stuff
right
away
i
could
detect
a
strong
similarity
to
la
fin
du
monde
another
excellent
strong
belgian
style
ale
there
was
little
head
and
a
transparent
golden
color
with
many
fine
bubbles
rushing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
it
smells
sweet
like
brown
sugar
andor
honey
and
the
taste
was
very
smooth
sweet
honeyladen
and
maybe
a
little
yeasty
it
was
delicious
heavy
and
fizzy
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
and
warmth
yet
quite
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
great
beer
id
drink
more
if
it
werent
so
expensive
i
stop
at
two
and
switch
to
a
lesser
beer
i
like
it
i
know
this
has
mad
rep
but
there
are
definitely
better
bspas
out
there
this
one
is
just
too
sharp
spiced
in
a
wholly
overwrought
manner
and
boozy
the
cuteass
bottle
goes
a
long
way
sure
but
a
bit
more
integration
and
balance
are
needed
here
before
this
one
should
be
allowed
to
run
with
the
bulls
d
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
can
appreciate
a
good
beer
when
i
drink
one
not
a
session
beer
but
nice
to
sip
out
of
my
tulip
glass
id
like
to
pair
this
with
good
food
overall
you
gotta
try
this
if
you
call
yourself
a
beer
fan
regardless
on
your
opinion
on
belgian
beers
because
its
unlike
anyone
youve
ever
had
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
this
is
an
alarming
amount
of
suspended
material
large
chunks
of
yeast
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
and
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
sweetearthy
malts
and
citrus
with
a
slight
amount
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
thick
and
chewy
mouth
feel
with
some
associated
sweetness
and
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
high
carbonation
level
present
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
so
concentrated
as
to
put
you
off
the
beer
the
citrus
flavors
are
very
strong
throughout
the
brew
malt
flavors
are
strongest
up
front
and
slowly
decline
through
the
drinking
a
little
hop
bitterness
is
there
but
again
not
in
too
strong
of
a
way
overall
after
a
few
sips
this
beer
gets
amazing
as
far
as
flavor
goes
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
past
some
pretty
huge
yeast
chunks
suspended
in
the
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
fast
fleeting
head
smell
is
that
typical
funky
smell
oh
so
inviting
first
sip
is
a
creamy
yeasty
party
in
your
mouth
bubbly
and
creamy
all
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
here
that
i
cant
rightly
describe
but
i
can
appreciate
it
a
bit
of
apple
or
pear
taste
i
dont
quite
know
but
its
fruity
its
like
champagne
with
carbonation
light
and
flighty
very
drinkable
dangerously
so
d
brewed
to
be
sipped
taste
kind
of
like
a
duvel
without
the
fruitiness
or
a
fresh
german
lager
with
more
yeastiness
really
refreshing
and
great
a
good
beer
here
a
fairly
high
drinkability
but
one
has
to
watch
themselves
not
to
drink
too
much
8
5
abv
d
very
good
this
one
is
refreshing
but
watch
out
for
the
9
overall
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
a
brew
thats
8
5
abv
an
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
i
cannot
believe
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
beer
what
an
outstanding
brew
this
is
one
of
a
kind
and
none
like
it
pours
a
huge
pillowy
head
with
nice
carbonation
but
not
overly
carbonated
taste
is
hard
to
discribe
lemony
zesty
full
of
life
and
flavor
some
peppery
flavors
as
well
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
the
year
quite
pricey
and
easy
to
drink
do
not
make
a
good
combo
as
one
could
sift
through
several
in
a
session
high
alcohol
content
not
detectable
leaves
great
lacing
down
the
glass
a
beer
lovers
dream
oh
but
hence
the
name
drink
it
slowly
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
treat
just
keep
the
abv
in
mind
when
enjoying
more
than
one
i
am
not
a
fan
of
belgian
yeasts
but
this
one
is
very
soft
and
i
loved
it
i
love
this
beer
looks
beautiful
smells
good
tastes
great
very
high
drinkability
9
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
one
of
the
best
ales
ive
ever
had
if
youve
yet
to
try
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
some
immediately
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
think
a
bit
more
sweetness
could
have
really
taken
things
to
a
whole
new
level
i
have
been
drinking
these
for
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
excellent
offering
d
phenomenal
job
of
masking
the
alcohol
with
delicious
flavors
the
best
job
ive
seen
in
a
high
alcohol
beer
this
is
crisp
and
biting
like
some
kind
of
gourmet
spiced
tropical
fruit
dessert
im
drinking
one
of
these
on
a
cold
iowa
winters
evening
and
its
near
perfect
on
a
hot
summers
day
after
being
outside
this
might
be
even
better
it
is
almost
dangerous
how
good
this
stuff
is
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
so
as
soon
as
possible
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
twofinger
head
that
leaves
some
aggressive
lacing
with
bits
of
yeast
sediment
floating
around
in
it
the
scent
is
a
mixture
of
yeast
slight
citrus
and
some
spices
including
clove
the
taste
is
starts
off
with
some
yeasty
citrus
gives
way
to
some
spices
and
subtle
hops
there
is
also
some
warming
from
the
high
alcohol
content
without
any
harsh
alcohol
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
the
citrus
and
yeast
comes
more
to
the
forefront
and
changes
the
dynamic
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
with
a
slight
thickness
and
light
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
a
great
beer
to
get
as
a
treat
this
is
one
of
the
ones
that
most
people
interested
in
beer
will
try
eventually
and
will
almost
certainly
enjoy
cheers
mouthfeel
is
good
it
went
down
smooth
carbonation
is
lacking
a
teeny
bit
but
its
not
something
that
would
depreciate
the
brew
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
compliments
the
finish
interesting
beer
ive
had
better
belgian
strongs
however
again
there
was
just
something
about
the
smell
that
put
me
off
i
cant
place
it
worth
a
try
though
nice
complex
flavor
good
atmosphere
really
strong
feel
strong
alcohol
taste
but
a
light
feel
in
the
mouth
good
sipping
brew
great
quaff
if
you
like
this
style
get
it
the
carbonation
in
my
bottle
was
mediumhigh
which
i
also
liked
allinall
a
very
fine
find
will
buy
again
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
a
beautiful
golden
straw
color
is
capped
by
a
longlasting
soapy
head
a
slightly
sour
smell
and
taste
that
is
hard
to
describe
but
once
you
smell
it
again
you
know
what
it
is
this
beer
will
leave
you
feeling
completely
stoned
a
flamboyant
beer
that
isnt
as
balanced
and
refined
as
duvel
but
is
still
tasty
and
dangerously
alluring
esp
with
its
seductive
fruity
esters
delirium
tremens
is
a
hazy
quite
sparkling
golden
ale
with
small
particles
floating
in
it
it
has
a
foamy
white
head
that
shows
good
retention
and
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
sugar
barnyard
leather
nutmeg
and
candy
like
mike
ikes
it
is
mediumfull
bodied
soft
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
very
full
flavor
thats
slightly
sweet
there
are
notes
of
leather
black
pepper
apple
and
phenol
it
has
a
warm
boozy
aftertaste
quite
classic
d
drink
extremely
well
for
the
large
8
5abv
overall
ive
seen
this
brew
advertised
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
i
have
to
respectfully
disagree
delirium
tremens
is
really
quite
nice
for
the
style
and
has
its
complexities
but
ive
had
superior
belgian
ales
and
even
better
american
made
belgian
style
ales
the
being
said
this
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
recommend
it
especially
if
youre
into
belgians
da
bit
too
pricey
but
otherwise
good
if
not
slightly
heavy
one
of
my
least
favorite
popular
belgian
beers
this
is
very
good
beer
but
i
cant
see
ever
buying
it
again
ive
had
it
probably
six
or
so
times
and
i
always
have
a
similar
opinion
first
the
beer
is
overcarbonated
its
not
a
bad
looking
beer
but
the
head
generally
doesnt
always
stick
around
when
its
actually
in
the
glass
as
opposed
to
when
its
crawling
its
way
out
of
the
top
of
the
bottle
to
a
certain
extent
the
beer
looks
and
tastes
like
orange
soda
i
do
enjoy
the
flavor
but
its
very
one
note
in
my
opinion
on
top
of
that
comparisons
to
the
duvel
are
hard
to
avoid
and
dt
loses
in
that
matchup
dt
seems
to
lose
a
matchup
against
any
of
the
top
widely
distributed
belgians
ok
any
of
the
strong
belgians
oh
leffe
anyway
i
love
the
bottle
and
the
glass
i
dont
know
how
it
ages
but
i
would
be
happy
to
try
a
vintage
bottle
to
see
if
the
complexity
goes
up
as
the
age
does
this
is
a
beer
that
is
simply
good
while
most
of
its
competition
is
great
d
i
drank
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
and
that
was
plenty
i
finished
it
gladly
however
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
12
ouncers
of
this
unless
i
was
really
in
the
mood
and
willing
to
spend
some
money
quaffable
with
a
light
nose
but
ultimately
unsatisfying
for
the
price
drinkability
very
good
a
beer
this
smooth
this
fresh
this
light
and
this
tasty
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
although
with
the
steep
abv
and
price
it
might
be
a
decision
you
would
regret
in
the
morning
incredibly
crisp
from
start
to
finish
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
refreshment
but
a
little
bit
too
bubbly
d
higher
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
this
is
one
to
sip
and
savor
but
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
glasses
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
a
session
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellowish
super
creamy
head
that
flows
out
of
the
bottle
during
the
pop
without
even
shaking
it
smells
and
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
tastes
banana
tropical
citric
extremely
refreshing
great
summer
beer
d
alcohol
is
high
but
nicely
hidden
i
wouldnt
have
trouble
drink
some
of
them
but
the
high
abv
will
slow
me
down
some
day
drinkability
even
highly
carbonated
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
with
such
a
crisp
clean
taste
its
hard
not
to
drink
this
faster
at
the
same
time
though
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
the
higher
abv
keeps
it
away
from
being
sessionable
drinkability
nice
beer
but
im
not
as
impressed
as
others
are
i
wish
it
didnt
have
the
floaties
as
it
really
turned
me
off
to
drinking
it
d
one
of
my
favorite
worth
a
try
wellbalanced
really
in
the
style
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
a
while
and
with
a
name
like
delirium
tremens
its
got
to
be
good
right
dont
know
but
well
soon
find
out
a
deep
dense
offwhite
head
rises
quickly
above
this
golden
brew
from
the
middle
of
the
bottom
of
the
tulip
a
column
of
swift
bubbles
rises
which
keeps
the
head
intact
for
a
while
circling
the
bubbles
is
an
army
of
sediment
soldiers
after
the
head
decides
to
fade
a
deep
sheet
of
pocked
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
bready
sweet
spicy
and
phenolic
tastes
of
sweet
malts
dried
fruits
florals
yeasts
and
bananas
theres
a
good
welcomed
hit
of
alcohol
heat
in
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
and
theres
big
carbonation
as
the
aforementioned
stream
is
still
going
fairly
strong
although
a
bit
abated
excellent
delirium
is
lightly
hopped
and
surprisingly
malty
for
such
an
airy
sunshine
beer
goes
down
exceptionally
smooth
considering
the
high
abv
litterly
could
drink
it
all
night
might
be
in
rough
shape
though
the
first
smell
is
fruity
almost
hefelike
also
has
a
first
taste
of
bananna
like
a
hefe
as
well
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
perferred
on
tap
nice
and
creamy
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
noctrum
this
is
joining
the
regular
rotation
drinkability
at
9
abv
this
is
a
sipper
but
one
which
i
could
sip
perhaps
all
night
overall
next
a
very
solid
belgian
though
next
time
ill
perhaps
opt
for
a
smaller
nightcap
this
is
good
shit
that
much
is
for
sure
that
said
you
cant
put
back
much
of
this
tasty
beer
in
one
sitting
the
abv
will
quickly
catch
up
to
you
and
throttle
the
hell
out
of
you
for
what
it
is
its
fantastic
though
in
conclusion
this
may
be
a
popular
beer
because
of
the
elephant
logo
but
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
and
the
flavors
it
presents
clear
straw
yellow
pretty
carbonated
and
heady
light
lacing
looks
pretty
the
silly
glass
is
a
little
over
the
top
overall
not
what
i
expected
at
all
in
a
good
way
very
high
alcohol
content
that
you
can
barely
tell
really
explosive
light
beer
recommended
not
to
beat
a
dead
horse
but
please
respect
beer
this
fine
fine
brew
was
totally
disrespected
in
my
eyes
today
and
at
8
for
an
8oz
which
was
not
specified
on
the
menu
by
the
way
i
feel
totally
taken
in
fact
i
even
had
to
order
another
simpler
beer
to
wash
away
my
liquid
sorrows
such
is
the
life
of
the
beer
guy
a
bit
pricey
but
is
a
most
pleasurable
experience
quite
unique
i
think
i
will
get
the
750ml
next
time
instead
of
the
miniscule
11
2oz
the
presentation
is
great
too
a
unique
bottle
with
a
great
lable
the
pink
elephants
dragons
and
strutting
crocodiles
are
classic
so
do
you
like
sparkling
cider
i
do
it
rules
in
fact
that
is
exactly
what
this
beer
reminds
me
of
looks
like
it
pours
like
it
smells
like
it
except
this
will
get
you
drunk
d
would
definitely
not
expect
this
to
be
the
9
abv
that
it
is
hides
it
well
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
a
little
overrated
and
built
up
into
something
spectacular
but
still
enjoyable
poured
a
clear
golden
with
little
to
no
head
fruity
and
full
of
other
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
a
little
nip
of
alcohol
but
nothing
to
turn
me
away
from
this
beer
the
smoothness
and
high
alcohol
mixture
can
make
a
couple
of
these
sneak
up
on
you
but
that
isnt
that
bad
of
a
thing
in
this
case
interesting
packaging
as
well
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
strong
ales
kraig
d
for
9
this
is
very
drinkable
but
there
was
something
about
it
that
made
it
just
good
and
not
excellent
for
me
d
a
good
belgian
beer
good
to
sip
on
more
flavor
than
a
dubbel
would
have
but
im
sure
that
one
at
a
time
is
good
enough
for
me
poured
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
good
head
and
lace
down
the
glass
a
citric
hop
smell
hit
me
first
slong
with
some
other
fruit
dark
and
tropical
and
some
minor
malt
sweetness
smooth
and
balanced
on
the
whole
with
a
medium
body
and
alright
carbonation
while
there
are
a
lot
of
fruits
in
the
taste
apple
orange
pear
berries
there
are
also
some
figs
and
a
caramelhoney
syrupy
sweetness
and
texture
on
the
outside
of
the
beer
also
had
some
spiciness
to
it
and
a
little
sour
crispness
with
some
of
the
fruit
taste
finishes
warming
and
with
a
spicy
fruit
taste
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
although
a
tad
sour
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
with
a
cool
logo
i
can
see
myself
ordering
this
again
and
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
nice
drinkability
for
a
9
abv
it
is
not
noticable
nice
golden
color
but
the
head
is
the
key
to
appearance
on
this
one
creamy
white
head
with
sticky
lace
bubbles
are
so
fine
that
it
looks
like
a
layer
of
whipped
cream
on
the
top
not
foamy
or
bubbly
at
all
smell
of
mild
fruityness
bananna
apple
apricot
not
very
bold
on
the
nose
but
mild
and
subdued
some
yeastyness
and
a
little
spice
show
up
also
taste
has
a
little
more
umph
than
the
smell
same
mild
fruityness
and
spice
just
more
noticable
9
is
well
hidden
full
body
with
a
smooth
finish
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
quality
brew
with
no
flaws
the
flavor
profile
is
not
as
in
your
face
as
many
of
the
extreame
beers
but
is
very
full
in
a
somehow
subdued
way
a
great
sipper
to
take
your
time
with
and
enjoy
what
shows
itself
with
each
sip
this
is
one
i
will
go
for
every
now
and
then
decent
brew
and
glad
i
tried
but
i
cant
see
me
buying
another
decent
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
though
d
avoided
this
beer
for
a
while
because
i
thought
the
delirium
tremens
was
simply
an
advertising
ploy
however
this
beer
is
very
good
and
deserves
a
sampling
by
all
advocates
i
poured
it
in
a
tulip
glass
and
was
delighted
by
the
brillant
yellow
color
the
yeast
sediment
was
easy
to
get
over
the
sutle
smell
is
is
decieving
when
you
actually
taste
it
the
taste
was
a
really
punch
in
the
taste
buds
i
could
taste
bits
of
honey
citrus
and
slight
clove
there
are
alomst
too
many
tastes
to
be
experienced
here
i
finished
the
bottle
in
one
sitting
a
delightful
strong
ale
8
5
abv
that
is
well
worth
trying
at
least
once
regaurdless
of
the
high
price
the
beer
pours
a
yellowish
golden
hazy
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
with
fruit
clove
and
yeast
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
some
prickly
carbonation
the
flavors
are
sweet
and
phenolic
and
fruit
spice
provides
some
balance
toward
the
end
a
belgian
ale
for
sure
and
a
good
one
at
that
would
have
again
a
very
light
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
drink
up
this
one
is
a
keeper
an
all
around
very
good
beer
if
you
can
get
past
the
yeast
sediment
this
is
well
worth
the
try
easy
mouthfeel
considering
its
abv
overall
puunch
in
aroma
flavour
this
has
some
serious
drinkability
i
could
have
gone
through
quite
a
few
without
looking
elsewhere
very
drinkable
doesnt
feel
very
heavy
refreshing
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
an
easy
one
to
sit
for
a
session
with
notes
it
reminded
me
of
but
is
not
the
same
as
of
course
duvel
i
can
see
why
some
source
named
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
even
though
i
have
others
that
i
prefer
above
it
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
in
fact
everyone
should
at
least
try
this
beer
once
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
and
will
definitely
continue
to
drink
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
and
brilliantly
clear
yellow
gold
in
color
with
a
little
over
a
finger
of
dense
white
head
that
retreated
rather
quickly
pleasant
aroma
lots
of
esters
with
some
phenols
and
just
a
hint
of
malt
character
the
esters
are
mostly
pears
some
green
apples
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
banana
the
phenols
are
restrained
and
slightly
spicypeppery
there
is
also
a
light
floral
character
possibly
from
some
later
hopping
or
from
the
esters
i
cant
really
say
it
is
quickly
becoming
evident
that
the
yeast
is
the
star
of
the
show
the
yeast
character
is
however
not
overwhelming
as
all
of
the
esters
phenols
and
alcohols
it
produced
coexist
quite
well
and
exhibit
an
excellent
balance
of
flavors
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
the
emphasis
on
the
fruity
esters
pears
and
green
apples
are
present
and
dominant
but
not
overwhelming
throughout
towards
the
finish
the
spicypeppery
phenols
return
and
take
over
but
soon
yield
to
a
pleasant
floralfruity
character
that
lingers
long
into
the
finish
a
solid
but
not
domineering
bitterness
builds
and
crescendos
at
the
finish
but
still
plays
in
the
background
a
soft
malt
character
that
compliments
the
other
flavor
components
quite
well
comes
and
goes
carbonation
is
a
bit
more
than
moderate
but
not
quite
as
high
as
i
would
have
expected
for
the
style
body
is
relatively
light
smooth
alcohol
an
a
somewhat
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
failrly
hard
to
detect
and
sneaks
up
on
you
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
very
quaffable
and
relatively
complex
this
brew
is
somewhat
more
restrained
than
others
of
the
style
but
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
yep
d
there
isnt
much
that
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
besides
the
high
abv
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ale
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
small
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
color
and
has
a
nice
1
inch
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
banana
a
variety
of
spices
and
a
touch
of
well
hidden
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
body
and
is
nicely
carbinated
i
can
taste
fruit
yeast
some
sour
flavors
and
alcohol
as
it
warmed
up
highly
recommended
this
beer
was
the
best
beer
on
tap
that
night
by
far
i
poured
the
750
ml
bottle
into
2
over
sized
wine
glasses
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
pretty
fluffy
white
head
the
head
leaves
lots
of
lacing
as
the
beer
is
consumed
the
beer
smells
of
ripe
fruitapricots
with
a
hint
of
alchohol
the
taste
follows
the
nose
very
well
balanced
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
suprisingly
drinkable
for
its
9abv
overall
a
great
beer
i
would
enjoy
this
brew
much
more
if
their
hadnt
been
so
much
yeast
i
carefully
tried
to
decant
this
bottle
but
the
chunks
came
out
long
before
i
even
reached
the
halfway
point
i
prefer
my
bspas
decanted
as
the
yeast
brings
too
much
of
a
chalky
flavor
and
drying
effect
in
the
mouth
otherwise
its
a
damn
tasty
brew
i
would
have
it
again
but
maybe
let
it
age
upright
for
a
few
monthsyears
d
another
dangerous
d
i
thought
the
pink
elephant
thing
was
a
joke
but
theyre
everywhere
on
the
walls
the
ceiling
coming
from
the
woodwork
the
vents
gettin
the
shakes

out
where
we
goin

dont
wanna
go

rough
night
tired
baby
tired
overall
i
love
the
name
of
this
brew
delirium
tremens
the
jitters
a
beer
this
good
should
have
a
warning
drinking
too
much
of
this
for
a
prolonged
time
will
give
you
extreme
withdrawal
symptoms
i
would
sip
this
all
the
time
such
a
great
beer
my
only
complain
is
that
the
taste
department
could
use
a
tiny
boost
cant
wait
to
try
delirium
nocturnum
overall
a
very
nice
beer
so
far
it
is
my
favorite
offering
from
brouwerij
huyghe
drinkability
is
fairly
high
flavors
are
great
and
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
just
easy
drinking
a
great
time
for
sure
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
a
couple
others
i
would
pick
before
this
one
for
this
category
high
abv
makes
for
a
couple
in
a
setting
probably
the
limit
d
a
beguiling
complicated
beer
that
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
could
be
dangerous
as
it
would
be
all
too
easy
to
have
a
couple
pours
a
unique
orangy
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
is
offwhite
the
nose
is
very
fruity
and
delicious
mainly
peaches
apples
and
spices
are
accompanied
by
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
huge
light
fruits
dominate
the
nose
along
with
some
spices
and
yeast
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
cannot
wait
to
try
nocturnum
d
dangerously
drinkable
at
any
time
of
year
but
with
its
9
abv
one
needs
to
exercise
caution
wonderful
stuff
pours
up
an
unfiltered
dark
hay
color
with
a
big
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
bubblegum
yeast
lemon
the
taste
is
of
bubblegum
and
the
taste
of
pineapple
this
beer
is
amazing
subtle
lemons
full
bodied
medium
carbo
delicious
i
love
this
beer
its
good
all
year
around
great
with
that
being
said
this
is
an
exciting
headturning
fun
different
beer
i
predict
it
has
mass
appeal
lets
put
it
this
waymy
fiance
who
does
not
like

likes
this

good
or
bad
thing
i
say
good
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
from
a
750
ml
corked
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellowish
color
with
a
light
white
head
cleary
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
present
large
particles
of
yeast
were
clearly
present
in
the
beer
good
aroma
to
the
beer
with
fruity
hints
but
the
flavor
was
kind
of
a
mix
between
a
hefe
and
a
belgian
the
beer
felt
good
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
it
pours
out
with
a
thick
white
bubbly
head
thats
about
three
and
a
half
fingers
thick
and
is
very
fluffy
and
sticks
around
for
quit
a
while
the
head
covers
a
light
golden
colored
body
that
fairly
hazy
and
has
some
very
active
carbonation
it
has
a
strong
fruity
aroma
some
lemon
spices
and
a
nice
alcohol
aroma
all
mixed
in
it
has
a
clean
smooth
feel
to
it
its
got
a
medium
body
and
the
alcohol
isnt
detectable
until
its
aftertaste
which
is
also
a
bit
tart
it
has
a
sharp
carbonation
feel
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
the
spices
a
very
noticeable
as
was
the
hop
bitterness
very
little
citrus
fruits
flavors
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
drink
ability
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
could
have
very
night
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
session
beer
a
bit
to
complex
for
that
this
is
an
overall
good
beer
that
is
great
on
a
hot
springsummer
day
i
recommend
this
beer
to
any
beer
lover
d
pour
me
another
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
belgian
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
still
a
very
pleasant
beer
white
winelike
in
some
ways
im
glad
i
bought
into
the
bizarre
marketing
on
the
bottle
and
went
for
it
overall
very
drinkable
nice
summer
brew
sitting
out
enjoying
the
day
at
8
5
it
packs
a
punch
that
creeps
up
on
you
not
much
alcohol
taste
to
it
i
prefer
the
nocturnum
however
crisply
carbonated
and
not
too
full
bodied
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
this
one
drinkability
seems
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
with
the
exception
of
the
sourness
i
think
thats
intentional
though
and
it
does
add
a
layer
of
complexity
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
bland
example
of
this
style
i
recommend
picking
this
up
anyway
because
if
you
enjoy
the
style
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
choice
somewhat
drinkable
although
the
sourness
gets
you
after
a
while
pours
clear
bright
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
and
surface
aroma
is
somewhat
phenolic
with
some
yeastiness
and
tang
apples
and
maraschino
cherries
taste
has
a
muted
sweetness
earthy
and
herbal
some
tangy
citrus
as
well
bananas
a
little
lingering
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
very
good
really
well
balanced
tasty
and
complex
delicious
and
balanced
but
strong
what
more
can
i
say
read
more
reviews
for
a
more
refined
palate
or
nose
but
i
know
this
is
one
great
beer
checked
out
the
website
for
this
brewery
and
their
little
bar
in
belgium
looks
cool
very
unique
decor
with
pink
elephants
hanging
around
an
almost
art
deco
50s
style
d
very
drinkable
tasty
refreshing
slight
alcohol
warmth
actually
feels
nice
and
lends
well
to
the
other
characteristics
d
one
of
the
better
belgians
that
is
widely
available
in
the
us
a
great
beer
that
is
very
deceptive
watch
out
for
the
booze
great
label
too
havent
had
this
in
a
while
but
its
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
and
is
now
definitely
back
in
the
rotation
not
my
favorite
i
do
enoy
belgians
but
this
is
more
like
a
wheat
beer
on
roids
not
feeling
it
i
can
appreciate
it
for
its
high
quality
craftsmanship
but
ill
skip
this
again
drinkability
a
sipper
for
me
ill
go
slowly
with
one
very
nice
beer
i
love
to
pull
this
one
out
every
now
and
then
i
cracked
the
top
open
and
poured
this
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
thick
pillowey
2
inch
layer
of
foam
quickly
rises
up
great
retention
decent
lacing
the
scent
is
very
intriguing
spicy
and
metallic
all
at
the
same
time
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
that
but
i
like
it
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
the
spice
shines
through
but
the
metallic
notes
not
so
much
which
i
am
thankful
for
highly
carbonated
very
zesty
and
extremely
effervescent
this
would
be
ideal
on
a
hot
day
but
might
want
to
watch
out
for
the
9
though
drinkability
is
jsut
average
i
dont
know
why
but
i
can
never
drink
a
great
amount
of
this
beer
recommended
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
on
a
fall
evening
with
a
holiday
meal
d
a
great
beverage
that
if
cheaper
i
think
i
could
almost
drink
all
the
time
surprisingly
refreshing
enjoyable
flavor
overall
a
great
brew
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
i
enjoy
the
tremens
most
on
a
hot
day
sessionable
for
me
even
with
the
9
superbly
smooth
and
drinkable
this
mediumbodied
beauty
is
very
refreshing
and
hides
the
abv
very
well
this
beer
is
a
very
very
good
belgian
strong
ale
it
has
a
golden
color
with
a
pillowy
loaf
of
bread
for
head
that
my
girl
friend
commented
was
maybe
too
thick
smells
estery
with
some
sort
of
spice
i
cant
quite
place
my
finger
on
tastes
a
lot
like
allagashs
triple
reserve
only
a
little
lower
key
for
the
flavors
very
esteryfruity
almost
sugary
flavor
with
good
bready
qualities
and
a
corriander
like
spice
drinks
very
well
and
is
refreshing
despite
the
8
5
d
a
solid
example
that
wont
disappoint
crisp
light
and
refreshing
very
worthy
of
a
recommend
subtle
and
tasty
and
more
alcohol
than
it
seems
the
pink
elephants
told
me
to
try
this
one
and
why
not
since
i
already
enjoyed
nocturnum
and
noel
thank
goodness
i
dont
suffer
from
delirium
tremens
i
think
there
are
some
pink
elephants
floating
in
my
glass
though
had
this
one
at
a
wine
food
and
beer
tasting
at
the
local
abc
liquors
poured
a
grand
golden
honey
color
with
fizzy
lifting
bubbles
in
it
smelled
yeasty
and
fruity
but
no
pink
elephant
musk
taste
was
genuine
belgian
strong
ale
banana
drak
cherry
cloves
and
mild
spice
i
love
a
good
complex
belgian
even
if
i
have
to
fight
off
the
pink
elephants
to
get
to
one
d
very
drinkable
it
is
not
overpowering
in
any
one
area
and
it
blends
very
well
together
it
also
does
not
feel
as
big
of
a
beer
it
is
very
nice
d
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
particularly
for
the
style
and
the
strength
really
nice
flavormild
but
does
enough
to
not
be
boring
could
probably
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
without
being
too
bad
off
a
good
belgian
for
a
nice
summer
night
here
in
socal
i
enjoy
the
delicate
spice
and
light
malt
but
maybe
a
tad
mellow
compared
to
some
other
bspas
a
phenomenally
delicious
beer
with
a
soft
belgian
funk
on
a
delicately
beautiful
malty
sweetness
this
is
what
life
is
about
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
any
of
this
style
are
going
to
be
compared
whether
fairly
or
not
against
the
duvel
well
the
tremens
certainly
is
pleasant
enough
but
lacks
the
depth
dense
carbonation
and
complex
flavors
of
that
beer
titan
still
grab
one
and
enjoy
hell
grab
a
couple
pours
golden
with
a
light
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
smells
yeasty
and
with
notes
of
clove
and
banana
as
well
as
a
sweet
breadiness
taste
is
similar
with
lots
of
banana
very
smooth
and
a
bit
light
and
a
bit
sweet
just
a
very
pleasant
beer
without
being
all
that
complicated
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
big
thick
white
head
forms
drops
some
nice
lacing
great
retention
keeps
a
solid
layer
smell
is
nice
sweet
sugary
floral
some
spice
yeast
bit
of
banana
very
fresh
aroma
honey
nice
taste
is
similar
quite
sweet
lots
of
light
fruit
and
banana
wheat
yeast
spices
alcohol
comes
through
nice
fresh
floralherbal
hoppiness
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
smooth
and
refreshing
d
highly
drinkable
i
think
letting
it
breath
for
few
minutes
let
some
the
of
aromatics
out
at
the
local
central
market
this
beer
usually
sells
out
the
same
day
a
new
shipment
arrives
and
i
can
see
why
drinkability
is
good
fairly
nice
balance
with
light
spice
and
well
hidden
alcohol
drinkability
light
crisp
and
balanced
this
one
always
leaves
you
wanting
another
i
see
where
the
delirum
can
set
in
solid
beer
and
easy
to
drink
so
watch
out
for
that
alcohol
content
quite
an
easy
drinker
and
far
from
what
i
remember
it
as
the
body
is
medium
and
not
too
heavy
even
if
the
alcohol
is
above
average
a
nice
drinker
to
mix
in
with
other
belgians
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
otheroom
in
nyc
poured
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
glass
pretty
large
white
fluffy
head
golden
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
a
touch
of
spice
and
sugar
in
the
nose
taste
was
awesome
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
one
and
i
forgot
how
good
this
beer
tastes
borders
on
the
sweet
taste
of
a
nice
belgian
tripel
the
abv
is
a
bit
noticeable
but
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
few
of
these
a
classic
belgian
offering
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
goes
down
easily
but
high
abv
means
this
is
not
a
beer
to
quaff
or
face
the
repercussions
dnot
a
chugger
pleasant
but
not
overly
easy
going
down
i
give
this
one
top
scores
for
originality
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
this
heavily
carbonated
drinkability
is
affected
somewhat
due
to
this
but
i
must
say
that
as
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
wished
there
was
more
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
would
highly
recommend
this
but
for
the
price
i
am
not
sure
how
much
more
i
will
be
buying
unless
i
find
myself
in
belgium
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
nocturnum
still
very
drinkable
if
not
for
the
borderline
ridiculous
price
i
had
to
pay
for
a
single
bottle
of
this
at
my
local
store
i
would
have
gone
back
and
bought
a
few
more
d
this
beer
is
a
lil
thick
not
too
much
so
though
that
it
is
hard
to
put
down
it
does
put
up
a
good
fight
though
this
isnt
something
you
drink
all
night
one
or
two
of
these
on
a
nice
occassion
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
the
first
one
that
i
would
choose
pours
a
silky
white
head
atop
a
golden
body
with
what
looks
like
fruit
pulp
flowing
freely
with
copious
carbonation
has
a
good
apple
and
lemon
aroma
the
taste
is
much
the
same
and
you
certainly
cannot
tell
that
its
9
the
mouthfeel
is
weird
it
is
both
strongly
carbonated
yet
smooth
from
the
yeast
and
what
not
that
floats
freely
to
be
honest
i
cant
really
decide
where
i
stand
on
the
beer
i
do
know
that
it
is
way
overpriced
and
i
certainly
hold
that
against
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
served
in
a
small
glass
but
very
nice
on
the
palate
and
worth
revisiting
t
is
a
golden
almost
straw
colored
beer
with
a
thick
two
finger
brilliant
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
the
long
haul
i
poured
it
before
i
ate
and
10
minutes
later
it
was
still
there
there
are
visible
flecks
of
yeast
floating
around
the
commotion
caused
by
the
constant
bubbling
the
smell
mostly
belgian
funk
there
is
also
a
cidery
aroma
that
comes
through
if
someone
didnt
know
what
they
were
smelling
you
might
almost
be
able
to
convince
them
it
was
cider
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
it
is
a
very
light
and
sweet
beer
with
some
good
yeasty
fruity
flavors
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
though
it
is
worth
a
try
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
ale
i
have
tried
i
tend
to
like
to
the
noel
a
bit
over
the
tremens
from
this
brewery
however
they
are
both
great
in
my
opinion
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
many
times
in
the
future
i
would
go
out
on
a
hunch
and
say
try
it
with
spicy
thai
or
vietnamese
or
maybe
game
bird
in
a
dark
sauce
me
i
had
it
on
its
own
it
paired
extremely
well
with
the
billiard
cue
i
had
in
the
other
hand
thanks
to
patra
for
this
wonderful
birthday
gift
this
one
bubbled
up
right
out
of
the
bottle
as
i
opened
it
it
poured
a
nice
golden
blond
color
with
an
aggressive
foamy
white
head
little
bits
of
yeast
sediment
were
floating
in
the
beer
that
was
otherwise
clear
the
aroma
has
lovely
notes
of
yeast
sweet
fruits
and
spice
the
flavor
doesnt
disappoint
doughy
yeast
and
malts
mix
with
sweet
fruits
pineapple
and
candy
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
lively
overall
its
very
refreshing
yet
complex
very
good
i
must
have
more
thin
on
the
palate
and
a
little
fizzy
but
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
pronounced
but
pleasant
smooth
alcoholquality
and
warmth
especially
in
the
finish
it
has
the
same
qualities
roughly
as
the
aroma
in
the
end
its
wonderfully
njoyable
and
interesting
yet
light
and
smooth
to
drink
d
a
decent
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
decent
beer
overall
but
alcohol
may
get
to
you
later
definitely
worth
a
session
with
it
notesa
great
brew
and
one
that
i
can
say
is
worth
the
bang
for
the
buck
man
is
it
spicy
the
entry
here
says
the
abv
is
9
00
however
my
bottle
says
8
50
i
do
not
know
if
i
got
a
different
type
my
bottle
looks
exactly
the
same
as
the
one
here
the
fresh
citrus
aroma
and
flavour
are
knocking
me
out
dynamite
stuff
its
missing
the
sweetness
of
a
tripel
but
has
the
fruitiness
i
find
is
missing
from
some
of
the
drier
examples
duvel
just
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
poured
into
a
golden
colored
ale
the
aroma
has
some
very
strong
citrousy
notes
the
beer
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of
fruit
produced
by
active
yeast
some
bitterness
is
noted
however
more
would
be
welcomed
certainly
a
very
good
beer
recommended
to
all
d
you
can
absolutely
down
these
which
is
scary
due
to
its
content
which
can
certainly
sneak
up
on
you
this
beer
wont
fill
you
up
and
the
taste
never
gets
old
d
very
nice
beer
while
the
alcohol
level
is
fairly
high
its
still
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
i
just
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
maybe
two
in
one
sitting
this
pours
a
glowing
golden
tangerine
with
several
fingers
worth
of
white
fluffieness
that
has
good
hang
time
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
juicy
fresh
fruitsspiceand
yeast
peaches
and
pears
are
upfront
on
the
tounge
closly
surrounded
by
clovesalcoholand
other
spices
too
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
and
pepperywith
a
pallet
coating
quality
that
is
in
a
league
all
its
owna
single
sip
can
be
a
five
minute
expierience
this
is
a
very
nice
bspai
would
not
recommend
drinking
this
when
operating
heavy
machineryits
a
creeper
looks
alot
like
a
german
hefe
golden
orange
floating
yeast
everywhere
very
exciting
it
has
a
strong
aroma
of
exotic
fruits
and
some
spices
taste
is
sweet
and
is
like
a
extreme
hefe
taste
until
there
is
a
dry
spell
which
is
accompanied
by
some
belgian
funk
very
nice
as
a
nightcaprelaxing
beer
overall
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
not
too
hoppy
nicely
balanced
if
not
for
the
high
alcohol
content
id
be
happy
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
drinks
well
despite
fairly
high
alcohol
content
d
a
good
easy
drinking
belgian
definitely
worth
it
md
very
crisp
and
clean
brew
warming
alcohol
presence
in
it
as
well
this
as
sat
at
the
back
of
my
stash
since
1991
and
i
thought
by
now
it
would
be
undrinkable
but
boy
was
i
surprised
unique
and
boy
that
aroma
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
having
heard
good
things
about
it
it
poured
a
light
clear
yellow
with
thin
head
almost
like
a
pilsner
it
smelled
like
wild
yeast
and
strong
lemon
tang
very
similar
to
merry
monks
it
tasted
like
sweet
sugary
yeast
and
hops
with
very
little
bitterness
and
the
sweet
aftertaste
lingered
the
texture
was
very
smooth
with
practically
no
carbonation
the
light
belgian
ales
arent
really
my
thing
i
want
to
try
delirium
nocturnum
so
i
cant
say
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
it
this
was
well
done
for
its
style
though
md
the
body
of
this
brew
is
relatively
light
and
quite
carbonated
the
carbonation
is
abundant
and
persistent
with
large
bubbles
reminiscent
of
soda
pop
despite
the
bubbles
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended
d
high
abv
but
a
nice
end
of
night
drink
a
good
replacement
for
champagne
very
tasty
highly
recommended
i
havent
been
totally
impressed
with
many
of
the
belgian
beers
ive
tried
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
into
a
tremens
glass
with
at
least
a
three
finger
white
foamy
head
that
took
a
while
to
go
down
the
smell
was
of
lemons
oranges
and
honey
it
tasted
the
same
the
citrus
flavor
was
key
some
grapefruit
even
coming
through
with
this
beer
a
very
delicious
beer
indeed
i
could
definitely
use
this
as
a
session
beer
md
carbonation
is
pretty
high
in
a
light
to
medium
body
mostly
dry
drinkability
is
nice
on
this
one
very
solid
beer
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
relatively
high
alcohol
beer
this
one
flies
under
the
radar
much
like
its
counterpart
duvel
i
would
like
the
pearapple
flavor
to
be
more
subtle
but
all
in
all
a
winner
a
little
too
yeasty
for
my
taste
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
big
belgian
ales
i
have
been
looking
foward
to
a
delerium
brew
for
quite
a
while
had
a
taste
of
the
nocturnium
and
procured
this
earlier
pours
out
a
superbly
foamy
head
rises
out
of
the
top
of
my
chalice
for
a
full
30
seconds
at
least
active
carbon
ation
bubbling
away
under
the
huge
pillow
the
beer
has
produced
wow
what
a
snapshot
bspa
somewhat
hazy
beautiful
goldenstraw
color
smells
of
yeasttart
lemony
aromas
biting
on
the
tongue
flavors
of
lemonyapricots
cherries
slight
burn
in
the
throat
very
long
sweetish
aftertaste
that
is
cut
pleasently
by
the
tartness
and
carbonation
wow
one
of
the
bes
example
of
this
style
i
have
sampled
thusfar
i
must
say
i
believe
i
will
take
the
noel
out
of
cellaring
and
refrigerate
for
soon
consumption

a
straw
yellow
with
a
haze
to
it
beautiful
solid
white
head
on
top
that
retains
about
a
half
of
an
inch
which
eventually
leads
to
great
lacing
sharp
and
sweet
aromas
sweet
breakfast
malts
almost
has
a
sour
aroma
reminding
me
of
calabaza
blanca
from
jolly
pumpkin
it
could
just
be
an
off

sweet
flavors
of
raisins
honey
and
winter
spices
some
sour
flavors
in
the
finish
very
high
carbontion
smooth
mouthfeel
the
sweets
hit
the
palate
perfectly
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
i
actually
enjoyed
the
slight

a
delirium
tremens

with
yeasty
bready
and

noticable

lots
of

along
with

definitely

2
oz
bottle
poured
a
murky
golden
orange
with
a
voluminous
white
head
and
bits
of
yeast
floating
in
the
solution
head
was
extremely
fluffy
with
excellent
retention
that
finally
subsided
into
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
begian
ringlets
some
lacing
but
somewhat
spotty
spicy
nose
with
the
presence
of
clove
citrus
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
taste
similar
to
nose
with
the
additional
presence
of
lemon
zest
extremely
lively
mouthfeel
very
effervescent
across
the
entire
tongue
and
mouth
but
a
little
too
much
burn
alcohol
was
very
wellhidden
with
a
clean
crisp
astringency
at
the
end
very
drinkable
brew
but
be
careful
because
experience
has
taught
me
that
a
couple
of
these
sneaks
up
on
you
pretty
fast
this
beer
tastes
great
but
the
expense
and
abv
will
make
it
a
very
infrequent
purchase
for
me
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
very
vibrant
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
for
me
as
it
is
my
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
really
like
it
others
around
me
at
the
bar
thought
it
was
wierd
but
ill
definitely
drink
again
very
good
beer
great
example
of
belgian
pales
d
very
strong
predominant
alcohol
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
the
flavors
are
pretty
enjoyable
definitely
a
good
strong
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
plan
to
follow
up
with
a
few
more
next
time
i
make
a
run
for
belgians
giant
fluffy
head
which
dissipates
suprisingly
fast
pale
golden
color
wlots
of
chunks
just
how
i
like
it
aroma
is
fruity
wnotes
of
apple
and
citrus
also
a
bit
spicy
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
which
i
like
in
a
belgian
as
it
tends
to
hold
up
better
as
the
beer
warms
taste
closely
matches
the
aroma
citrusy
and
spicy
very
refreshing
somewhat
tart
beer
like
most
belgian
beers
drinkability
is
good
given
its
complexity
and
8
5
abv
if
you
like
duvel
and
other
belgians
chances
are
youll
like
dt
pours
a
clear
yellowlight
orange
and
bubbly
as
hell
good
fluffy
head
that
retains
quite
well
and
leaves
some
lace
a
few
sediment
chunks
in
here
despite
a
careful
pour
nose
is
spicy
with
some
fruitiness
taste
is
fruity
with
good
spice
fruits
through
the
middle
a
very
dry
finish
with
the
slightest
bit
of
vinous
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
one
would
expect
which
i
prefer
drinkability
is
good
but
a
little
bit
abrasive
bc
of
the
excessive
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
the
nocturnum
and
the
noel
but
this
one
is
also
a
classic
decision
when
you
just
dont
feel
like
shopping
for
a
while
in
the
beer
store
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
short
white
head
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
as
well
nose
is
not
as
complex
as
i
would
expect
mostly
floral
hops
slight
sweetness
alcohols
taste
follows
with
the
same
mainly
hoppy
and
heady
a
good
option
for
when
you
still
want
some
good
abv
but
not
all
the
weight
of
a
normal
belgian
the
bottom
line
if
you
like
belgian
pales
then
tremens
is
a
standard
its
not
one
of
my
absolute
top
tier
favourites
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
pale
then
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
great
beer
one
id
be
remiss
not
to
both
recommend
and
look
to
cellar
definitely
wont
be
my
last
delirium
before
i
started
to
drink
great
beer
one
of
my
friends
told
me
that
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
the
world
of
beer
had
to
offer
this
was
a
girl
who
is
fourfive
years
older
than
i
am
and
has
a
palate
in
beer
i
respect
morethansignificantly
while
i
was
still
unable
to
get
into
pg13
movies
she
was
bringing
six
packs
of
microbrew
to
college
parties
in
short
she
without
knowing
it
served
as
a
guide
to
the
beer
advocate
i
am
today
i
cant
write
about
this
beer
without
straying
into
a
miniautobiography
mentioning
my
closest
friends
in
the
same
breathes
as
my
favorite
beers
whether
it
serves
as
the
reason
to
start
drinking
good
beer
the
first
beer
i
was
legally
served
at
one
of
the
better
beer
bars
in
all
of
the
country
or
a
constant
i
can
always
go
to
when
i
want
to
be
reminded
of
why
i
drink
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
never
fails
to
deliver
can
i
drink
it
all
night
absofrekinlutely
will
i
regret
it
in
the
morning
see
the
first
rhetorical
question
do
i
care
not
so
much
in
the
end
as
a
chick
flick
once
said
you
just
want
to
be
with
the
ones
you
love
you
get
a
5
0
delirium
tremens
this
is
the
second
delirium
ive
had
and
i
have
to
say
it
will
not
be
the
last
it
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
urge
others
to
enjoy
it
as
well
wjvii
and
drizzam
that
means
you
guys
overall
experience
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
afford
this
beer
all
the
time
but
i
cant
330
ml
from
local
bjs
i
just
love
the
fact
they
serve
belgians
there
and
the
menu
is
secret
from
most
patrons
poured
nice
golden
color
with
slightly
foamy
white
head
nose
had
hint
of
bananas
with
cooked
cane
sugar
taste
was
excellent
cane
sugar
granny
apple
finish
with
that
slight
bit
of
belgian
sourness
the
mouthfeel
was
warm
but
not
of
alcohol
definitely
would
drink
another
if
i
didnt
want
to
sample
other
belgians
has
the
consistency
of
a
beer
half
its
strength
without
the
kick
of
alcohol
i
tend
to
expect
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
really
incredibly
light
on
its
feet
with
great
subtlety
and
deft
balance
oh
and
a
slight
whiff
of
belgian
funk
d
this
is
a
good
after
dinner
beer
to
sip
and
relax
with
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
on
tap
i
should
buy
some
of
this
in
the
bottle
too
great
beer
after
hearing
much
about
this
beer
was
really
interested
in
sampling
it
saw
it
in
various
great
beers
of
the
world
books
and
its
attractive
presentation
in
a
marblelike
white
bottle
supposed
to
prevent
exposure
to
sunlight
with
elegant
blue
foil
and
cork
piqued
my
curiosity
the
brewerys
website
claims
that
this
might
be
the
worlds
best
beer
paid
8
99
for
this
from
wine
and
beverage
depot
in
totowa
beautiful
appearance
golden
blonde
with
rising
carbonation
and
huge
frothy
head
has
a
distinctly
sweet
bubblegum
aroma
that
peeps
out
immediately
after
popping
the
cork
great
fruity
honeylike
aroma
taste
was
a
perfect
five
awesome
has
a
champagnelike
characteristic
to
it
a
very
smooth
crisp
belgian
pale
ale
and
although
strong
might
apply
to
its
8
5
abv
you
would
never
detect
the
alcohol
behind
a
flavor
so
sweet
and
satisfying
one
of
my
all
time
faves
a
great
beer
definitely
recommended
served
far
too
cold
and
waited
for
this
beer
to
warm
the
neat
thing
about
waiting
for
this
beer
to
warm
is
that
you
can
actually
smell
the
floral
bouquet
coming
to
life
on
this
this
pours
a
bright
yellow
approaching
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
good
lacing
on
the
glass
until
the
end
the
scent
is
really
complex
on
this
with
dominate
scents
of
citrus
fruit
fruity
esters
and
some
slight
pear
scents
and
belgian
sugars
work
nicely
together
immediate
flavors
are
fruity
and
spicy
apples
and
orange
peels
are
the
first
fruits
that
i
pick
out
along
with
strong
spiciness
and
pepper
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
effervescent
crisp
light
and
bubbly
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
you
can
taste
it
in
the
finish
drink
ability
is
good
and
actually
dangerously
easy
i
dont
know
what
to
say
more
about
this
brew
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
that
i
was
expecting
ive
had
it
numerous
times
over
the
years
but
maybe
my
mind
is
remembering
a
better
brew
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
could
be
better
and
yes
i
reviewed
this
one
at
just
cooler
than
cellar
temperature
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
very
accessible
to
people
who
arent
familiar
with
belgian
beers
i
tried
it
because
id
read
it
was
voted
best
beer
in
the
world
i
dont
think
id
go
that
far
the
head
lasts
forever
light
bodied
but
definitely
a
high
alcohol
beer
based
on
its
warming
power
wow
this
is
nice
i
could
easily
drink
the
whole
750
but
i
poured
it
to
share
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
white
head
very
yeasty
nose
with
a
slight
sweet
and
citric
edge
to
it
eck
flavor
is
bordering
on
extremely
tart
though
on
the
second
sip
you
are
used
to
it
smooth
and
even
though
it
exhibits
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
feel
is
just
where
you
want
it
though
the
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
more
noticeable
amount
of
the
alcohol
involved
that
is
not
masked
as
well
as
it
could
be
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
some
time
and
it
is
good
theres
more
spices
on
the
palate
notes
of
spiced
fruits
if
there
is
such
a
thing
pale
malt
crisp
bitterness
and
floral
hops
clean
finish
on
it
considering
the
yeast
presence
a
nice
beer
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
drinkability
good
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
has
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
recommended
a
pretty
damn
good
bspa
this
is
probably
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
again
i
dont
care
much
for
belgians
i
want
to
try
as
much
as
i
can
though
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
just
not
for
me
in
enjoy
this
beer
enough
to
keep
it
around
the
house
apparently
at
the
time
of
serving
they
were
out
of
proper
glassware
so
it
came
in
a
pint
glass
which
actually
work
fairly
well
there
was
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
an
interesting
mix
of
white
grape
bubble
gum
and
lemon
juice
those
carried
over
into
the
flavor
with
the
addition
of
subtle
creamy
spice
definitely
an
interesting
beer
here
and
you
really
cant
ask
for
much
more
than
that
sometimes
bright
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
apples
and
other
fruit
tastes
mainly
of
apples
too
sweet
for
me
like
im
drinking
apple
cider
lots
of
carbonation
and
fizzing
on
the
palate
i
got
through
one
bottle
but
i
dont
know
when
id
feel
like
another
the
bottle
looks
cool
though
ideally
id
have
just
one
smaller
330ml
bottle
do
they
make
this
but
ill
probably
finish
the
whole
bottle
i
poured
this
expensive
overpriced
wash
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
great
pile
of
a
head
and
was
very
nice
smell
was
bready
and
i
thought
this
might
be
great
blond
ale
taste
was
terrible
though
it
was
a
bit
spicey
but
had
a
sour
taste
that
just
was
not
good
to
me
now
if
you
like
a
belgian
ale
you
should
try
it
i
guess
but
for
me
i
will
not
buy
again
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
very
very
very
cloudy
pale
light
golden
color
it
has
tons
of
sediment
in
it
more
than
i
think
any
other
beer
ive
had
except
for
some
wierd
australian
beer
i
had
once
smell
is
good
fruit
and
yeast
and
alcohol
taste
is
absolutely
exquisite
dances
on
the
tongue
almost
has
a
champagne
feel
to
the
mouth
a
reallly
awesome
beer
i
rarely
give
out
5s
but
this
beer
deserves
one
for
taste
d
one
of
my
favourite
beers
and
close
to
the
top
of
my
list
for
belgians
delicious
flavours
a
fun
beer
to
drink
go
buy
this
one
now
overall
an
excellent
belgian
ale
if
you
like
duvel
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
try
only
problem
is
that
the
yeast
is
easily
disturbed
and
can
become
loose
in
the
bottle
and
doesnt
resettle
ive
had
several
bottles
from
huyghe
that
ended
up
like
this
in
the
past
so
its
not
uncommon
with
me
maybe
distancetravel
is
the
culprit
or
poor
handling
by
my
source
however
it
does
not
appear
to
affect
the
flavour
so
it
is
just
for
appearances
sake
fruity
start
bitter
finish
and
silky
mouthfeel
lend
this
beer
an
exceptional
drinkability
almost
goes
down
too
easily
for
its
abv
makes
an
excellent
evening
sipping
beer
good
tasting
beer
could
do
a
session
with
this
beer
but
i
would
not
last
long
follows
style
would
drink
again
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
little
deceiving
looks
like
a
golden
ale
with
lots
of
foamy
head
but
the
aroma
is
all
fruit
and
sweetness
the
9
alcohol
did
not
overpower
the
flavor
of
the
beer
instead
it
was
very
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
balanced
by
plenty
of
fine
carbonation
poured
this
from
a
faux
ceramic
bottle
into
a
chalice
poured
beautifully
with
golden
haze
and
a
thick
sticky
head
that
left
lacing
everywhere
smelled
delicious
almost
like
a
fruit
salad
with
notes
of
white
grapes
cherries
pineapple
and
much
more
nice
complex
flavor
very
sweet
both
fruity
and
wheaty
medium
body
a
very
warming
beer
delicious
but
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
overall
i
would
love
to
try
this
brew
again
thanks
to
mmtmatrix
for
this
delightful
extra
very
enjoyable
had
it
bottled
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
an
orangegold
color
with
a
very
heavy
head
its
smell
was
awesome
an
aroma
of
grassy
smells
made
this
very
unique
in
my
books
the
bitter
taste
of
the
drink
was
very
strong
making
you
savor
each
sip
tremens
was
well
balanced
with
its
carbonation
as
well
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
for
me
d
good
beer
but
not
a
session
for
me
i
dont
think
i
care
for
the
sour
attribute
in
beer
pleasant
quite
good
indeed
not

good
drinkability
for
the
rather
high
abv
overall
its
a
fine
brew
deserving
of
its
reputation
always
a
good
choice
if
you
have
a
belgian
itch
to
scratch
d
excellent
beer
on
this
cold
blustery
day
delerium
tremens
pours
a
slightly
copper
bright
gold
with
a
foamy
head
the
head
sticks
around
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
on
my
new
allagash
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
pilsner
malts
with
fruity
esters
there
are
hints
of
earthy
yeast
and
herbal
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
mostly
dry
with
plenty
of
esters
and
lots
of
chalky
earthy
yeast
the
malt
is
secondary
and
is
much
less
sweet
but
still
there
there
is
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
flavor
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
beer
is
almost
more
sour
than
bitter
i
was
happy
to
see
this
at
a
local
grocery
store
this
is
a
nice
sipping
ale
not
overly
assertive
with
any
one
flavour
but
its
darn
tasty
id
get
this
again
more
of
the
same
on
the
tongue
rather
dry
and
crisp
theres
pale
malt
cloves
spiciness
fruit
rind
and
alcohol
more
medicinal
character
this
is
a
mediumbodied
ale
but
it
packs
a
punch
and
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
quite
warming
perfect
for
a
chilly
autumn
night
such
as
this
d
this
one
is
by
no
means
a
sipper
the
alcohol
seems
almost
nonexistent
the
after
taste
is
pretty
dry
causing
you
to
want
to
drink
more
too
bad
the
other
qualities
dont
do
the
same
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
easy
to
go
down
alcohol
is
not
easy
to
taste
so
it
could
easily
get
the
best
of
you
if
not
careful
the
12
oz
bottle
poured
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
bits
of
yeast
particules
being
carried
around
by
the
carbonation
large
white
billowing
head
helped
fill
my
duvel
tulp
the
smell
of
friuty
belgian
yeast
bublegum
and
some
citrus
are
great
meduim
body
easy
drinking
flavors
of
sweet
malts
light
herbal
with
more
of
a
citrus
after
bite
than
hoppy
bitter
in
the
end
ill
say
it
again
realy
easy
to
drink
would
not
take
to
much
for
me
to
drink
another
one
to
be
honest
i
expected
quite
a
different
experience
than
the
one
i
got
i
guess
its
because
i
had
always
expected
something
incredibly
intense
from
such
a
strange
bottlename
combination
i
really
enjoy
a
good
belgian
ale
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
i
imagine
this
is
what
duvel
would
want
to
grow
up
into
some
day
i
can
certainly
taste
the
strong
d
pretty
good
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
normal
bud
light
miller
lite
color
head
vanishes
with
the
quickness
smell
was
sweetrubbing
alcohol
type
smells
taste
was
alright
oily
butttery
more
like
wine
flavors
mouthfeel
was
creamy
frothy
smooth
going
down
keeps
my
mouth
wet
drinkability
was
alright
i
liked
it
but
nothing
special
i
would
drink
it
again
maybe
md
what
a
quality
belgian
lively
on
the
palate
full
in
character
with
wellbalanced
sweetness
and
full
breadiness
with
the
hoppy
supports
a
nice
brew
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
beer
than
i
found
probably
on
account
of
the
hype
and
the
packaging
its
just
another
decent
belgian
whatever
o
i
cant
get
sick
of
delirium
tremens
this
is
an
absolute
classic
beer
alcohol
catches
up
with
you
but
still
very
drinkable
otherwise
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
the
high
alcohol
content
will
shy
some
drinkers
away
however
the
alcohol
is
very
wellmasked
and
the
brew
overall
is
somewhat
mild
while
remaining
very
rich
in
profile
and
complex
in
taste
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
white
floaties
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cirtus
cloves
and
faint
touch
of
anise
and
yeast
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
nice
earthiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
dry
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
rather
have
a
la
fin
du
monde
or
a
duvel
what
a
nice
belgian
ale
this
is
warm
and
friendly
with
a
nice
personality
oelergud
drinkability
not
for
me
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
tons
of
lacing
left
all
over
the
glass
lasting
until
the
finish
aroma
is
crisp
and
light
full
of
fruity
esters
and
a
nice
grassy
hop
presence
taste
is
malty
and
spicy
and
full
of
the
typical
belgian
flavors
banana
clove
spice
but
it
isnt
too
strong
and
isnt
a
fully
complex
as
some
of
the
other
belgian
strong
ales
definite
hop
bitterness
is
noted
and
is
well
balanced
by
the
sweetness
of
the
belgian
flavors
mouthfeel
is
great
crisp
refreshing
and
exceptionally
smooth
despite
the
high
abv
an
excellent
beer
for
drinking
any
time
just
be
careful
a
magnum
bottle
is
enough
to
make
me
very
happy
for
the
evening
drinkable
but
i
was
disappointed
enough
not
to
order
another
comment
i
fist
enjoyed
this
beer
at
staminee
de
garre
i
was
a
belgium
novice
and
i
was
swept
away
by
the
mystique
of
the
boast
of
the
best
beer
in
the
world

my
tastes
have
matured
but
delirium
tremens
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
very
enjoyable
but
by
design
you
couldnt
handle
too
many
a
great
beer
on
a
great
day
drinkability
unique
beer
no
doubt
but
one
that
for
some
reason
i
only
seek
out
every
few
months
because
i
havent
had
a
delerium
in
while
great
during
colder
weather
when
higher
abv
spiced
beers
are
nice
try
ore
or
three
on
tap
at
delerium
cafe
in
brussels
amazing
bar
and
decent
flagship
beer
my
first
sample
from
brouwerij
huyghe
and
not
my
last
this
beer
really
didnt
impress
me
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
much
more
complex
and
this
was
after
letting
it
sit
for
20
minutes
out
of
the
fridge
before
opening
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbling
head
and
bits
of
particulate
being
bounced
around
by
the
aggressive
carbonation
the
smell
is
very
enjoyable
and
complex
hints
of
fruit
and
belgian
candy
sugar
mix
with
an
almost
weizenlike
cloveyness
to
form
quite
the
smell
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
a
light
grapelike
fruity
maltyness
that
does
a
perfect
job
of
covering
the
alcohol
almost
to
the
point
of
making
the
alcohol
indiscernible
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
full
creamy
carbonation
to
boot
given
the
abv
rating
along
with
the
smoothness
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
makes
this
one
dangerous
brew
excellent
all
around
and
a
must
try
ive
been
seeing
these
pink
elephants
for
a
few
years
now
and
this
was
the
first
one
ive
managed
to
get
my
hands
on
go
get
your
own
goes
down
rather
nicely
although
obviously
not
a
session
beer
given
the
high
abv
which
btw
you
may
not
even
notice
this
beer
actually
comes
across
as
pretty
thirst
quenching
and
in
my
mind
is
the
perfect
marriage
of
sweet
and
sour
a
very
nice
beer
served
in
a
goblet
this
was
a
clear
deep
straw
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
phenomenal
i
was
surprised
and
amazed
with
the
powerful
and
unique
bouqet
on
this
onebananas
bubblegum
tropical
fruit
flowery
honey
and
peppery
spice
this
smelled
like
candy
i
think
i
spent
more
time
inhaling
this
one
than
drinking
it
this
had
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
to
start
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
which
im
not
a
fan
of
i
just
prefer
a
bitter
finish
in
my
beer
this
did
have
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
the
sourness
was
a
bit
more
noticeable
mediumbodied
and
quite
drinkable
but
the
abv
makes
it
suffer
a
bit
in
this
area
a
must
try
beer
due
to
its
uniqueness
and
complex
nose
i
poured
this
one
and
noticed
it
left
a
little
head
as
i
continued
drinking
the
color
was
a
weak
gold
imo
and
the
smell
had
a
fruity
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
pretty
good
not
too
bitter
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
comes
across
it
purchased
this
12oz
bottle
from
the
state
liquor
store
pours
a
opaque
yellow
color
similar
to
a
witbier
light
wight
head
settles
very
quickly
smells
of
fresh
fruit
perhaps
apples
or
pears
tastes
faintly
sour
maybe
like
apricots
or
other
dried
fruit
im
also
not
detecting
much
hop
bitterness
other
than
what
you
might
expect
from
a
european
pale
ale
light
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
flavor
may
be
a
bit
different
for
some
tastes
but
its
nice
certainly
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
750ml
bottle
enjoyed
on
my
35th
birthday
an
excellent
way
to
get
the
party
started
i
am
amazed
that
the
abv
is
9
extremely
drinkable
and
fresh
it
poured
a
golden
color
and
was
very
effervescent
crisp
apple
cider
was
on
the
nose
and
palate
plenty
of
sediment
that
was
hopefuley
yeast
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
though
notes
im
not
sure
ill
buy
again
in
the
future
this
seems
like
it
wants
to
be
duvel
but
comes
short
especially
in
the
appearance
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
enough
to
choose
it
over
duvel
again
d
highly
drinkable
although
the
abv
catches
up
quickly
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
overall
its
a
great
beer
very
complex
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
the
flavor
is
superb
and
thats
what
counts
its
alcohol
is
wellhiddenor
make
that
wellincorporated
a
quintessential
belgian
pale
ale
and
it
goes
down
wonderfully
a
thing
of
joy
and
celebration
and
delirium
tremens
apparently
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
certain
uniqueness
of
its
kind
unfortunately
not
12
as
good
in
a
bottle
as
on
tap
if
you
are
trying
this
beer
for
the
first
time
please
try
to
find
somewhere
that
serves
it
as
it
should
be
served
cheers
d
this
is
a
drinkable
and
great
brew
i
finished
mine
rather
quickly
great
by
itself
or
paired
with
spicy
foods
i
had
this
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
on
june
21
2007
the
aroma
was
malty
and
the
beer
was
a
golden
colour
the
first
mouthfeel
provided
a
soapy
taste
to
it
future
tastes
provided
less
soap
and
a
clovenutmeg
taste
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
the
higher
alcohol
content
wasnt
as
evident
as
i
thought
it
would
be
maybe
i
missed
something
with
this
one
as
it
is
rated
so
highly
by
other
bas
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
so
i
could
see
what
i
was
getting
into
it
poured
beautifully
enough
and
had
a
good
head
which
seemed
to
linger
and
linger
and
linger
the
smell
was
ok
but
i
didnt
find
it
all
that
pleasing
which
should
have
been
a
warning
sign
i
guess
the
taste
really
threw
me
off
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
maybe
i
have
a
terrible
palate
but
all
i
got
from
it
was
metal
maybe
some
slight
spiciness
grains
and
did
i
mention
metal
this
is
not
one
i
plan
on
buying
again
maybe
im
missing
the
appeal
but
the
belgians
should
stick
to
lambics
a
great
tasting
brew
one
of
the
best
ive
had
just
on
flavor
alone
a
sipping
brew
but
definitely
one
ill
enjoy
quite
a
few
more
times
the
texture
is
rather
starchy
and
a
bit
warm
overall
interesting
but
not
exceptional
in
my
humble
opinion
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
that
youll
want
to
savor
to
get
a
feel
for
the
depth
of
flavor
that
it
offers
it
has
a
hazy
blonde
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
started
out
as
about
an
inch
of
white
foam
it
has
strong
citrus
and
yeast
nose
the
yeast
is
distinctive
and
you
can
taste
it
as
well
as
smell
it
it
tastes
a
bit
foamier
than
it
looks
with
some
spices
maybe
nutmeg
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
i
like
it
but
it
is
a
beer
that
i
could
only
drink
once
and
a
while
it
is
definitely
a
warmer
drinkability
ive
had
several
delirium
products
and
this
is
the
first
time
ive
actually
sat
down
and
provided
a
review
overall
this
is
a
good
sipper
with
a
widemouth
chalice
adding
to
the
creation
of
a
nice
representation
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
a
staple
of
what
i
keep
in
stock
d
so
light
its
highly
drinkable
the
dry
finish
makes
you
want
more
and
its
dangerously
good
for
9
d
drinkability
is
good
its
a
tasty
beer
a
very
nice
example
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
but
not
the
best
out
there
it
pours
a
nice
lighter
color
smells
of
strong
alcohol
and
a
trace
of
fruits
apple
or
a
light
grape
taste
well
there
sure
is
some
alcohol
in
there
that
is
for
sure
and
a
nice
end
a
beer
to
take
your
time
with
and
sip
by
the
end
you
might
see
the
elephants
dancing
delerium
tremens
is
a
lovely
beer
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
the
price
abv
obviously
limits
the
drinkability
great
to
bust
out
for
special
occasions
one
difference
of
the
delirium
i
had
to
toronto
and
the
one
i
had
at
home
was
the
alcohol
content
it
was
8
7
abv
labled
on
the
bottle
in
toronto
but
8
5
abv
labled
on
the
bottle
here
in
socal
but
anyway
after
finishing
the
whole
bottle
things
started
to
feel
a
little
different
they
dont
call
this
delirium
tremens
for
nothing
its
440
and
my
100th
review
is
coming
to
an
end
and
so
is
the
subject
this
has
been
a
sublime
experience
next
stop
initiate
status
d
i
would
order
this
its
a
nice
easy
beer
that
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
your
bud
lite
friend
drinkability
i
really
wouldnt
sit
through
more
than
one
glass
of
this
again
and
would
only
do
that
if
going
through
a
bottle
at
a
bar
with
some
friends
i
think
there
are
much
better
for
the
style
but
also
much
worse
d
no
real
drinkability
at
all
due
to
the
high
abv
however
each
sip
is
to
be
savoured
a
belgian
classic
gotta
love
this
bottle
the
pink
elephants
blue
foil
and
painted
bottle
such
a
display
ok
enough
of
that
onto
the
beer
pours
a
murky
straw
yellow
with
a
bright
fluffy
white
head
with
large
bubbles
lacing
is
stickyickyicky
oooweee
almost
paints
the
glass
white
fruity
yeast
seems
to
dominate
this
smell
herb
and
spices
seem
to
tingle
the
nose
as
well
alcohol
makes
a
quick
appearance
as
well
taste
is
just
what
expected
from
the
smell
fruity
spicey
yeasty
alcoholy
honey
sneaks
up
on
the
tounge
as
well
mouthfeel
has
a
hop
bite
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
lacking
a
bit
because
the
alcohol
is
so
present
but
the
beer
overall
is
a
good
one
into
a
chalice
pours
a
lovely
gold
but
once
again
displaying
my
ineptitude
at
pouring
without
getting
yeast
mixed
in
there
there
is
all
kinds
of
stuff
floating
about
the
head
is
massive
pillowing
a
mass
of
white
foam
sits
atop
everything
and
just
chills
out
the
aroma
is
a
bit
disappointing
the
spices
and
citrus
were
there
just
not
that
appealing
for
whatever
reason
the
taste
was
better
but
not
the
slice
of
beer
nirvana
that
i
remember
it
as
fruits
citrus
and
spices
in
the
mix
just
a
bit
off
and
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
belgians
wtf
anywho
the
mouth
is
solid
and
really
it
sounds
like
im
bashing
this
boy
but
im
not
its
a
good
one
just
not
the
favorite
anymore
i
suppose
t
one
of
the
best
tasting
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
far
removed
from
my
birthday
dinner
where
i
didnt
know
more
than
3
beer
styles
this
is
a
great
beer
there
is
just
enough
tartness
to
cut
the
sweet
fruit
flavor
the
finish
is
nice
on
the
mouth
the
alcohol
is
present
but
does
not
detract
from
the
taste
i
wanted
to
lower
the
drinkablility
due
to
the
high
alcohol
but
this
is
a
beer
i
keep
grabbing
the
galss
for
i
know
one
is
enough
meaning
i
would
not
sit
in
session
with
this
beer
but
its
a
great
beer
to
try
and
come
back
to
this
poured
from
the
faux
stone
bottle
with
the
pink
elephants
with
a
ton
of
head
it
almost
looks
like
detergent
on
top
of
the
golden
ale
the
retention
was
good
very
frothy
and
lacy
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
zesty
lemony
tone
slightly
cloudy
in
appearance
not
chill
haze
because
i
poured
at
room
temp
the
taste
is
also
fruity
with
a
heavy
dose
of
alcohol
it
has
the
slight
burn
of
a
wine
going
down
very
full
tasting
and
heavy
mouthfeel
its
a
bit
misleading
the
color
leads
me
to
think
pilsner
and
then
it
wallops
with
a
heavy
fullness
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
few
without
planning
for
a
place
to
stay
poured
a
pale
bubbly
yellow
with
a
very
fine
white
head
smelled
creamy
and
almost
wine
like
tasted
sweet
almost
citrousy
like
a
mild
orange
flavor
a
touch
of
sourness
finished
with
a
bit
of
licorice
taste
and
a
very
crispclean
smooth
feel
this
was
a
beer
id
enjoy
sipping
any
day
of
peculiar
rich
taste
i
havent
had
this
in
about
4
years
just
another
great
beer
that
i
had
forgotten
was
this
good
if
i
was
going
to
criticize
i
could
say
that
it
could
have
done
well
with
slightly
less
sweetness
but
since
it
is
perfect
as
is
and
the
balance
hides
flavors
making
a
more
interesting
drink
i
wont
criticize
served
in
a
piraat
tulip
beer
appeared
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
stayed
in
form
for
a
minute
or
two
not
much
lacing
the
smell
was
of
typical
belgian
yeast
taste
was
sweet
some
alcohol
way
in
the
background
and
more
of
that
belgian
yeasty
goodness
carbonation
was
fairly
lively
but
not
too
much
so
wasnt
too
bubbly
had
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
d
the
full
flavour
alcohol
that
makes
it
so
great
also
reduces
the
drinkability
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
belgian
ale
i
really
do
not
enjoy
too
much
alcohol
flavor
ive
had
plenty
of
beers
with
9
alcohol
that
have
that
flavor
wellmasked
unappetizing
appearance
and
generally
mediocre
flavor
ill
pass
in
the
future
d
enjoyable
for
some
reason
i
expected
this
to
be
a
little
different
because
of
the
crazy
bottle
and
label
if
this
wasnt
as
dry
this
might
have
been
a
real
winner
nothing
too
exotic
here
it
seems
there
are
better
strong
belgian
pales
out
there
but
this
is
pretty
prototypical
a
fine
offering
worth
another
round
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cloudy
yellowish
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
two
finger
creamy
white
head
which
lasts
forever
into
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
of
malts
yeast
slight
citrus
spices
and
pears
the
taste
is
sweettangy
slightly
grassy
yeasty
with
a
nice
touch
of
spices
this
brew
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
with
a
slight
warming
factor
medium
body
a
very
tastycomplex
well
rounded
brew
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
im
really
enjoying
this
one
today
drinkability
very
drinkable
complex
yet
accessible
this
is
one
nice
beer
cheers
overall
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
carbonation
level
is
just
ridiculous
i
dont
really
feel
as
though
i
am
giving
justice
to
the
beer
from
this
review
but
until
i
fork
out
another
10
this
will
stand
overall
very
drinkable
would
be
xcellent
for
chillin
on
the
patio
this
summer
eve
also
with
the
exception
of
the
last
two
drinks
the
8
5
abv
was
quite
well
hidden
on
tap
and
zenos
in
state
college
pa
clear
light
goldenyellow
with
a
small
white
creamy
slowly
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
a
very
pleasant
lightly
sweet
blend
of
straw
flowers
citrus
white
grape
and
spice
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
fruit
and
citrus
not
being
to
dominant
flavor
yet
being
the
most
noteworthy
and
they
carry
through
the
finish
and
win
out
over
the
alcohol
and
a
light
aftertaste
there
not
bad
enough
to
really
knock
any
points
off
for
but
its
there
it
has
a
medium
body
almost
juicy
texture
and
low
carbonation
this
was
quite
the
refreshing
little
treat
and
quite
the
little
devil
i
had
no
idea
it
was
9
until
i
checked
here
id
definitely
get
this
again
overall
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
from
a
different
store
i
poured
it
like
i
was
pouring
a
duvel
and
there
were
abnormal
amounts
of
residue
coming
out
of
the
bottle
even
13
into
my
pour
chunks
were
coming
out
i
realize
there
is
a
little
sediment
sometimes
but
ive
never
seen
this
much
down
the
drain
with
you
this
poured
a
perfect
lightbodied
pale
gold
very
active
carbonation
with
slight
haziness
even
the
most
careful
of
pours
yields
an
absolutely
massive
head
very
bubbly
and
soapy
with
great
thickness
cover
the
glass
the
smell
is
at
first
of
lemony
cirtus
with
a
strong
sense
of
oily
components
by
going
deeper
through
this
light
floral
complexities
are
noted
with
a
nectarlike
smell
the
taste
repeats
these
flavorings
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
spice
and
a
sour
aftertaste
the
foamy
body
creates
an
incredible
mouthfee
that
goes
down
very
smooth
beginning
as
frothy
and
ending
as
light
and
watery
very
drinkable
only
the
sour
aftertaste
prevent
the
scoring
of
a
5
in
this
category
very
pleasant
to
drink
and
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
golden
strong
ale
the
beer
was
served
a
very
crisp
blond
with
a
thin
head
that
was
somewhat
lasting
and
left
very
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
good
balance
of
citrus
fruits
with
some
pale
malt
there
was
a
crisp
sweet
taste
that
was
somewhat
fruity
accompanied
by
pale
malts
and
yeast
the
body
was
medium
on
the
tongue
almost
creamy
with
a
crisp
light
alcohol
bite
the
finish
was
just
slightly
bitter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
albeit
rather
pricey
it
would
be
perfect
for
any
special
occasion
i
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
drink
a
bunch
but
the
cost
and
availability
are
an
issue
overall
a
very
good
strong
golden
a
more
hoppy
interpretation
although
hop
levels
are
generally
moderate
for
this
style
this
one
has
a
distinct
hop
presence
throughout
the
only
problem
is
trying
to
pick
out
all
the
flavors
they
tend
to
meld
together
so
well
that
there
are
only
a
few
general
descriptors
that
fit
this
is
an
odd
one
sweet
phenolic
and
esteric
is
that
a
word
estery
for
the
style
ill
have
to
try
this
again
maybe
this
bottle
was
from
a
flawed
batch
brouwerij
huyghe
has
a
lot
of
hits
and
misses
in
their
lineup
of
beers
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
hits
maybe
the
best
beer
they
make
this
bottle
was
dated
2006
and
poured
into
a
new
belgium
glass
it
is
a
golden
almost
straw
colored
beer
with
a
thick
two
finger
brilliant
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
the
long
haul
i
poured
it
before
i
ate
and
10
minutes
later
it
was
still
there
there
are
visible
flecks
of
yeast
floating
around
the
commotion
caused
by
the
constant
bubbling
the
smell
mostly
belgian
funk
there
is
also
a
cidery
aroma
that
comes
through
if
someone
didnt
know
what
they
were
smelling
you
might
almost
be
able
to
convince
them
it
was
cider
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
it
is
a
very
light
and
sweet
beer
with
some
good
yeasty
fruity
flavors
i
would
certaintly
drink
this
again
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
for
me
all
in
all
a
fairly
boring
strong
pale
ale
not
bad
at
all
and
well
made
but
fairly
uneventful
worth
the
money
but
there
is
better
out
there
for
a
belgian
i
think
its
decent
but
i
cant
say
its
anything
particularly
special
for
what
it
is
by
itself
its
pretty
darn
good
in
line
with
other
belgians
its
decent
had
better
750ml
brown
bottle
made
to
look
like
its
ceramic
yellow
translucent
body
with
bits
of
yeast
floating
in
it
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
delirium
beers
and
a
couple
inches
of
white
head
smells
citrusy
and
yeasty
with
hints
of
spice
and
vanilla
tastes
citrusy
spicey
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
alcohol
really
isnt
noticeable
light
to
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
a
pretty
good
belgian
maybe
this
is
good
beer
but
the
cloves
are
a
taste
i
just
freaking
hate
took
this
25
4
oz
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
popped
the
cork
yes
it
actually
had
a
cork
in
it
and
poured
it
into
a
clean
dry
glass
poured
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
the
pillowy
soft
head
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
with
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
first
thing
i
smelled
was
citrus
more
lemon
than
orange
tough
to
smell
anything
through
my
stuffy
cold
though
malty
and
citrusy
taste
with
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
little
taste
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
as
well
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
going
down
which
doesnt
surprise
me
with
the
9
abv
all
in
all
this
was
a
good
beer
and
im
sure
25
4
ounces
wont
be
enough
for
tonight
apearance
is
quite
nice
with
he
contrast
of
the
golden
cloudiness
and
the
white
foamy
head
the
flavor
will
vary
from
batch
to
batch
but
generally
a
hint
of
candyspice
and
fruit
the
depth
of
the
beer
falls
a
bit
short
with
an
ending
that
finishes
too
fast
for
a
sweet
belgium
for
me
all
in
all
it
is
still
worth
trying
and
comming
back
to
now
and
again
for
the
abv
it
drinks
allright
im
sure
this
better
back
in
europe
at
least
it
was
the
time
i
had
it
maybe
this
bottle
is
too
young
at
14
a
4pack
here
might
be
a
long
before
i
revisit
despite
the
high
abv
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
made
a
session
beer
without
problem
although
how
long
you
could
stand
for
is
another
question
entirely
i
hate
to
admit
this
one
was
a
drain
pour
id
choose
the
nocturnam
or
noel
over
this
one
for
the
delirium
beers
mouthfeel
was
full
mouthfilling
texture
and
high
carbonationchampangelike
very
nice
better
than
expected
despite
the
name
this
is
not
just
a
novelty
beer
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
an
excellent
body
it
is
light
but
has
a
definate
kick
to
it
plus
who
can
deny
the
little
pink
elephant
definatly
a
better
beer
on
tap
then
out
of
the
bottle
but
either
way
you
drink
it
tremens
is
still
delicious
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
would
definatly
consume
another
or
two
the
delirium
is
the
belgian
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
pours
light
and
airy
with
a
thick
head
tropical
phenols
and
a
slight
rounded
hop
profile
yeasty
and
clean
at
the
same
time
which
hides
the
high
abv
fruity
carb
sizzle
on
the
tongue
a
slight
burn
on
the
throat
and
a
dry
finish
nice
ale
malts
are
not
too
sticky
and
play
well
with
the
other
flavors
very
easy
going
down
watch
out
or
it
will
kick
your
ass
this
beer
i
had
been
wating
to
try
for
a
while
and
i
actually
just
bought
the
noel
but
havent
had
it
yet
this
was
a
good
overall
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
the
smell
of
cloves
is
billowing
from
the
light
head
limited
in
the
way
of
bubles
but
definitly
nice
and
cloudy
so
who
knows
tastes
awesome
clove
and
bannana
flavors
upfront
finishes
slightly
sweet
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
i
prefer
a
unibroue
with
their
distinctive
yeast
taste
but
maybe
id
order
another
of
these
definitly
not
close
to
the
worst
beer
ive
tried
another
great
beer
at
the
sunset
grill
i
have
been
putting
this
off
partly
because
of
the
7
69
price
tag
and
the
feeling
this
brew
was
just
too
trendy
to
be
real
bottle
is
indeed
quite
unique
with
its
yellow
opaque
color
and
pink
elephants
on
the
label
poured
from
the
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
it
was
a
beautiful
gold
bronze
color
slightly
cloudy
it
produced
a
big
soap
suds
looking
head
that
left
a
clean
set
of
lacing
rings
as
it
settled
really
powerful
nose
of
yeasts
and
malts
with
lots
of
spices
with
coriander
most
prominent
with
citrus
fruit
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
feels
good
going
down
with
a
slight
creamyness
finish
slightly
bitter
but
overall
while
this
is
good
there
are
belgium
strong
ales
domestic
versions
right
here
in
my
own
back
yard
such
as
north
coast
pranqster
belgian
that
tasted
just
as
good
and
costs
a
fraction
of
what
i
paid
for
this
one
a
nice
beer
carbonation
cuts
into
the
drinkability
for
me
but
very
controlled
properties
for
a
big
beer
sufficiently
dry
and
smooth
that
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
that
8
5
abv
would
get
me
eventually
d
it
is
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
though
its
a
little
sharp
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
incredible
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
my
chalice
to
join
the
large
and
bright
white
head
that
lasts
very
well
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
very
fruity
citrus
and
peaches
very
sweet
in
an
entirely
natural
way
honey
makes
a
welcome
appearance
strawberry
and
melon
as
well
along
with
spicy
cloves
and
pepper
wonderful
taste
isnt
quite
as
complex
but
banana
and
light
yeastiness
come
to
the
fore
with
spices
in
the
mix
and
slightly
noticeable
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
warming
but
crisp
plenty
of
body
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
remarkable
bspa
extremely
unique
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability

out
of
the
bottle

an
oversized

it

little

it

alright
some
of
the
flavors
seemed
kind
of
out
of
place
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
no
way
worth
the
money
one
of
my
first
belgian
beers
and
it
has
been
a
long
time
to
get
back
around
to
reviewing
it
almost
champagne
like
in
character
sweeterless
hoppy
than
i
recall
or
more
likely
my
taste
has
moved
on
a
bit
still
damn
tasty
and
i
bet
it
would
go
well
with
sushi
as
is
evident
from
the
graphic
this
beer
starts
with
a
really
nice
presentation
uncapping
it
even
to
a
nose
as
dead
as
mine
belgian
fruitiness
is
in
the
air
it
pours
a
wheaty
champagne
tint
with
a
healthy
frothy
and
dimpled
head
which
just
keeps
coming
the
lacing
pulls
down
like
a
rorschach
test
like
those
clouds
that
kick
imagination
into
gear
the
mouth
feel
is
yeasty
and
carbonated
but
not
too
much
of
either
a
reminder
of
its
goodness
hangs
about
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
its
8
5
abv
is
not
apparent
absorbed
by
its
blend
this
is
a
good
brew
somewhere
god
said
let
there
be
belgians
and
let
them
make
good
beer
had
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
left
very
little
lacing
some
fine
yeast
particles
floating
about
the
smell
is
of
lemons
spice
touch
of
bananas
the
taste
is
sweet
a
bit
sugary
lemony
however
not
blown
away
with
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
fizzy
a
very
good
bspa
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
belgian
ale
drinkability
always
a
big
fan
of
belgians
and
this
one
is
no
exception
high
carbonation
nice
bite
goes
down
easy
ah
dt
my
friend
this
belgian
pours
a
nice
slightly
pale
gold
with
nice
white
head
that
thins
to
fair
lacing
a
bit
milky
too
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
a
notice
of
the
alcohol
content
the
flavor
is
excellent
sweet
fruity
and
potent
its
very
smooth
and
tingly
and
drinks
surprising
well
considering
its
9
abv
wallop
beer
was
strawcolored
almost
golden
in
appearance
the
smell
was
very
fruity
with
just
an
underlying
hint
of
yeastyness
the
taste
was
amazing
i
didnt
notice
the
alchohol
at
all
flavor
was
smooth
slightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
something
like
banana
or
apple
mouthfeel
was
extremely
light
almost
reminiscent
of
a
7up
or
other
clear
soda
drinkability
was
amazing
had
i
not
been
warned
of
the
high
alchohol
content
i
probably
would
have
finished
it
in
a
matter
of
minutes
luckily
taking
my
time
helped
me
to
fully
appreciate
the
experience
cant
wait
to
have
this
beer
again
although
listed
here
as
9
percent
alcohol
my
bottle
says
8
2
appearance
is
nice
hazy
with
some
little
floaters
very
good
head
that
lasts
throughout
smells
very
strongly
of
fruit
maybe
lemon
and
alcohol
taste
is
good
i
dont
like
this
bspa
as
much
as
la
fin
du
monde
or
duvel
but
still
a
good
choice
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
has
its
weakpoints
it
seemed
a
little
too
grainy
for
me
which
may
appeal
to
some
people
still
i
would
recommend
someone
to
at
least
try
it
once
pours
a
light
golden
straw
color
with
fluffy
chunky
head
that
takes
a
while
to
fade
and
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
smells
very
flowery
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
very
sweet
and
estery
with
a
hint
of
banana
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
carbonation
building
up
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
you
swallow
something
ive
only
really
felt
with
belgian
ales
all
in
all
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
it
is
a
lovely
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
untill
about
34
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
very
deceptive
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
sizeable
head
that
lingers
well
aroma
is
sweet
with
yeasty
notes
pleasant
hoppy
taste
well
balanced
with
some
wine
characteristics
nicely
carbonated
feels
so
comforting
to
the
palate
alcohol
is
well
concealed
making
it
quite
drinkable
should
you
choose
to
dangerously
overall
this
is
a
very
winelike
brew
champagnelike
carbonation
level
and
loads
of
grapey
flavor
with
a
high
abv
when
i
get
married
ill
toast
with
this
instead
of
the
usual
bubbly
stuff
poured
a
wonderful
white
lacy
head
while
chunks
of
sediment
fizzed
a
trail
through
a
backdrop
of
a
gold
orange
hue
a
lively
aroma
with
phenolic
qualities
mixed
with
a
light
corrander
scent
the
mouth
is
silk
with
a
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hoppiness
not
overly
bitter
because
of
the
extra
barley
but
has
an
alcoholic
warmth
at
the
finish
poured
the
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
to
produce
a
large
frothy
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
also
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
crisp
and
sweet
with
an
array
of
fruits
that
quickly
make
for
the
alcohol
to
come
and
warm
things
up
with
quite
a
bite
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
is
lacking
in
the
drinkability
category
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ale
delirium
has
long
been
a
big
favorite
of
mine
but
it
only
just
arrived
here
in
n
c
i
poured
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
after
letting
it
sit
a
little
while
out
of
the
fridge
not
a
lot
of
head
very
fine
white
foam
beautiful
deep
golden
color
with
a
great
aroma
of
banana
and
possibly
some
apple
in
there
first
hit
on
the
tongue
wakes
up
the
taste
buds
in
a
big
way
i
always
thought
tremens
was
a
tripel
but
that
big
initial
blast
of
hop
proves
it
is
really
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
isnt
overwhelming
but
surprising
at
the
very
least
after
your
buds
get
over
the
initial
blast
you
begin
to
taste
the
incredible
floral
boquet
theres
a
little
coriander
maybe
a
little
citrus
it
definitely
stays
there
for
quite
a
while
too
great
lingering
aftertaste
overall
this
is
just
one
of
my
top
beer
favorites
worldwide
cant
beat
the
bottle
and
packaging
either
pink
elephants
have
a
couple
of
these
and
youll
definitely
see
a
couple
of
them
great
drinkability
major
cool
label
appeal
i
actually
drink
this
one
from
the
bottle
sometimes
it
is
a
different
experience
the
brew
froths
up
so
much
in
your
mouth
you
experience
different
qualities
in
the
taste
if
not
only
the
texture
glad
i
found
this
as
a
single
at
a
local
bp
of
all
places
only
3
or
so
for
the
12
ounce
vs
god
knows
what
somewhere
else
its
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
this
style
is
something
i
am
not
seeking
out
as
much
absolutely
gorgeous
head
color
and
lacing
lots
of
fruity
esters
a
bit
acidic
tasting
with
notes
of
citrus
like
it
but
do
not
love
it
d
a
very
drinkable
belgian
its
up
there
with
duvel
although
not
as
refined
or
complex
this
ones
got
rougher
edges
but
its
still
pretty
damn
good
sweet
and
light
without
any
real
hop
character
and
a
well
rounded
citrus
malt
goes
down
real
easy
as
far
as
delirium
is
concerned
i
actually
prefer
nocturnum
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
though
too
bad
its
kind
of
pricey
ide
be
willing
to
drink
it
from
a
normal
bottle
to
get
a
better
price
the
flavour
started
spicy
and
the
tart
apple
and
pear
tastes
came
next
it
finished
with
a
malty
smoothness
and
a
gentle
alcholic
warming
it
was
mediumbodied
and
nicely
effervescent
without
being
abrasive
an
easydrinker
despite
the
high
abv
light
gold
in
colour
with
some
haze
and
yeast
chunks
strong
carbonation
clear
banana
aroma
along
with
some
fine
cardamom
pods
and
black
pepper
notes
and
apple
skins
flavor
wise
the
light
malts
give
way
to
a
fairly
strong
metallic
note
before
the
typical
belgian
spicy
yeasty
thing
kicks
in
theres
a
bit
of
a
sour
twang
on
the
back
end
finishes
very
dry
and
light
aside
from
the
metallic
note
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
good
beer
it
seems
very
much
like
a
tripel
drinkability
good
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
was
a
clear
yellow
medium
head
some
lacing
aroma
was
all
light
sweet
fruit
a
nice
fruit
taste
balanced
by
the
hops
it
however
had
more
substance
to
it
than
i
thought
and
it
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
very
nice
beer
one
i
would
drink
again
but
on
this
night
there
were
others
waiting
picked
this
up
at
dawgs
bottle
shop
in
greensburg
poured
an
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
to
try
for
the
first
time
love
belgians
and
making
my
way
through
all
the
big
names
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
bright
white
rocky
and
uneven
head
first
smell
brought
lighter
sweet
smelling
fruitsbananas
and
pears
first
taste
bitter
and
then
sweet
came
in
to
balance
things
out
alcohol
taste
hidden
well
until
it
warms
up
only
a
slight
drying
and
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
but
on
lighter
side
not
quite
as
bubbly
as
a
duvel
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
taste
is
very
chewy
tons
of
malt
all
the
usual
suspects
are
here
orange
banana
coriander
an
apple
juice
like
mild
sourness
and
lots
of
yeast
though
malty
i
find
this
to
be
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
many
of
the
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
very
mild
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
slight
bite
on
the
tongue
this
beer
really
slides
down
easily
and
although
i
intended
on
just
sipping
it
as
i
do
most
belgians
its
so
extremely
drinkable
i
find
im
trying
not
to
down
it
in
bigger
gulps
a
very
summery
belgian
that
ill
come
back
to
again
drinkability
boobalishously
quaffable
however
la
fin
du
mond
tastes
better
and
is
alot
cheaper
still
if
a
hobo
gave
me
the
chance
id
thumbs
up
that
son
gun
with
two
hands
i
have
heard
so
much
talk
about
this
beer
but
it
made
me
a
bit
disappointed
its
just
another
strong
belgian
ale
overall
not
the
most
complex
belgian
strong
paletripel
ive
had
but
just
damned
tasty
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
having
heard
good
things
about
it
i
was
underimpressed
i
gave
it
high
marks
for
clarity
too
much
head
no
matter
how
i
poured
it
at
40
degrees
into
a
room
temp
glass
i
ended
up
with
80
foam
the
head
was
beautiful
though
white
and
lacey
i
detected
zero
hop
aroma
and
very
very
little
hop
bitterness
no
alcohol
flavor
either
the
sweet
slightly
burnt
malt
and
sugar
profile
came
through
strongly
lots
of
candi
sugar
i
guess
i
can
think
of
few
brews
as
delicious
on
a
summer
day
mouth
feels
some
tartness
rich
malty
feel
with
a
light
bitterness
at
the
back
d
a
fifth
of
this
is
a
bit
much
but
it
is
friday
night
so
whatever
it
is
pretty
good
nothing
i
would
go
looking
for
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
it
was
offered
reminds
me
a
lot
of
unibroues
don
de
dieu
but
with
less
flavor
and
less
cloyiness
yeah
i
know
that
isnt
a
word
and
a
nice
and
original
bottle
and
label
d
a
great
beer
tastes
great
goes
down
nice
and
clean
would
buydrinkrecommend
anytime
highly
recommended
drinkability
dry
and
refreshing
i
will
certainly
drink
more
but
rather
than
cracking
another
id
more
likely
savor
the
first
and
try
to
figure
out
its
different
subtleties
better
drinkability
although
it
has
an
8
5
abv
i
feel
as
if
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
that
may
be
a
very
dangerous
thing
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
with
high
levels
of
carbonation
remember
to
be
careful
when
opening
this
thing
the
cork
in
mine
literally
shot
out
of
the
bottle
with
great
force
if
it
was
to
hit
me
in
the
face
or
something
who
knows
what
it
could
have
done
just
a
warning
d
i
could
drink
it
all
night
the
flavor
is
great
and
it
doesnt
get
old
on
your
tongue
surprisingly
refreshing
because
its
quite
strong
were
hooked
on
the
delirium
that
weve
had
rating
high
on
our
cellar
scale
this
offering
should
be
kept
for
special
occasions
hiding
it
from
your
freeloading
beer
beggar
friends
new
find
from
the
belfast
coop
pours
bright
yellow
with
a
long
lasting
head
smells
a
bit
yeasty
and
bread
like
taste
is
really
nice
yeasty
flavor
some
fruitiness
and
alcohol
show
up
in
the
background
overall
a
really
nice
golden
ale
reminds
me
a
bit
like
duvel
actually
almost
quite
like
duvel
just
slightly
different
warning
careful
with
that
cork
as
mine
flew
off
after
barely
touching
the
cork
overall
a
decent
beer
within
its
style
and
a
good
beer
all
around
i
think
that
it
could
have
been
much
better
if
the
hop
spice
and
fruity
notes
could
have
played
a
larger
part
definitely
worth
a
try
regardless
dt
is
extremely
drinkable
its
a
strong
pale
ale
that
isn
t
that
strong
but
highly
enjoyable
i
could
drink
delirum
tremens
until
i
started
seeing
pink
elephants
in
places
other
that
the
label
or
glass
disclaimer
ba
does
not
endorse
drinking
until
intoxicated
very
nice
pleasant
belgian
ale
refreshing
and
obviously
dangerous
probably
the
best
beer
ever
named
after
a
symptom
of
alcohol
withdrawl
a
delightful
beer
which
i
cant
stop
sniffing
or
drinking
d
recommend
to
everyone
who
loves
a
great
strong
pale
ale
overall
the
first
time
i
reviewed
this
beer
my
palate
wasnt
quite
up
to
par
more
than
a
year
later
i
went
back
to
this
brew
and
glad
i
did
a
near
classic
overall
quite
a
tasty
beverage
hard
to
detect
the
9abv
lots
of
carbonation
though
like
a
champagne
the
only
bad
part
of
my
experience
with
this
beer
was
that
my
girlfriend
traded
me
her
blue
moon
for
the
last
half
of
my
dt
what
can
i
say
im
a
nice
guy
but
i
definately
got
screwed
in
that
deal
goes
to
show
nice
guys
finish
last
this
beer
poured
a
golden
cloudy
color
with
a
nice
thick
persistent
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
and
maybe
a
little
sour
the
taste
is
fruity
sweet
and
a
bit
alcoholic
the
mouthfeel
isnt
thick
but
is
slightly
chewy
it
is
highly
carbonated
but
smooth
in
the
aftertaste
id
consider
this
a
very
delightful
and
drinkable
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
a
bit
cloudy
and
smells
of
fruit
or
slightly
soured
fruit
the
head
was
nice
and
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
mouthfeel
is
chewey
but
smooth
taste
is
fruity
with
a
slight
bitter
taste
but
still
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
d
this
beer
has
a
fairly
good
balance
of
sugary
sweet
malt
and
green
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
it
has
a
very
smooth
alcohol
heat
that
makes
it
go
down
very
fast
it
would
be
nice
if
it
had
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
malt
or
hops
to
give
it
some
depth
it
may
have
been
a
skunky
bottle
not
stored
correctly
maybe
i
poured
it
wrong
not
sure
but
it
reminded
me
of
the
miller
lite
they
sell
at
ball
games
in
a
way
except
a
premium
version
maybe
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
abv
i
will
drink
this
again
drinkability
is
extremely
high
from
start
to
finish
excellent
beer
fine
taste
wonderful
example
of
a
strong
pale
alternative
to
duvel
and
nearly
as
tasty
d
8
5
abv
its
hard
to
tell
really
its
a
great
tasting
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
while
this
beer
is
not
rated
as
high
as
la
fin
du
monde
i
think
its
damn
close
an
outstanding
belgian
strong
pale
highly
recommended
plus
the
wife
likes
it
for
a
9
abv
this
one
goes
down
way
too
easy
alcohol
is
expertly
masked
by
an
upfront
malt
sweetness
with
flavors
of
fresh
tropical
fruit
and
loads
of
honey
alcohol
catches
up
to
you
by
the
end
of
the
glass
so
watch
out
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
belgiums
this
was
delicious
this
would
be
a
nice
entry
into
the
world
of
belgians
it
does
not
overwhelm
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
something
of
a
cross
with
less
hearty
offerings
very
drinkable
almost
deceptively
so
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
lively
head
smells
great
with
a
spicy
yeasty
smell
coupled
with
some
great
malt
tastes
great
a
very
malty
spicy
with
a
hint
of
yeast
mouthfeel
is
great
coating
the
tongue
with
flavor
and
carbination
very
drinkable
hey
thanks
to
solomon420
for
this
treat
translucent
honey
color
with
little
suspended
particles
throughout
i
expected
lots
of
head
from
this
beer
but
somehow
got
more
than
that
the
foamy
yeasty
paperwhite
head
rose
out
of
the
glass
like
a
souffle
its
quite
a
beauty
to
behold
in
a
nice
tulip
glass
the
first
thing
to
hit
my
nose
was
strong
flowery
esters
namely
sweet
rose
and
tulip
there
are
also
lots
of
apples
and
pears
giving
an
overall
sweet
nose
the
taste
again
was
huge
on
flower
petals
and
pears
though
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
there
was
a
sour
bitterness
which
was
a
bit
pithy
or
zesty
maybe
on
the
back
of
the
palate
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
especially
in
vapors
and
released
a
bouquet
of
sweet
and
savory
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
too
watery
for
my
taste
though
it
did
thicken
up
on
the
backside
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
to
alcohol
and
overwhelming
flavors
and
aromas
but
it
certainly
is
an
adventure
sweetness
with
a
funky
middle
and
a
spicy
bitter
tailall
wellbalanced
watch
out
for
the
abv
d
i
would
definately
get
this
again
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
quiet
sweet
which
this
mood
doesnt
come
to
me
often
but
when
it
does
i
know
what
im
going
for
mediumbodied
and
it
goes
down
smooth
enough
and
though
this
wasnt
exactly
a
bad
beer
at
9
a
750
ml
bottle
and
with
the
high
alcohol
content
and
taste
this
is
just
not
going
to
be
something
i
will
buy
again
anytime
soon
poured
a
semiclear
soft
golden
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
and
heavy
with
carbonation
some
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
glass
aromas
of
dried
fruit
hard
candy
grass
and
alcohol
seemed
to
dominate
the
taste
was
fruity
and
mildly
refreshing
with
a
blast
of
bitterness
making
a
sudden
entrace
at
the
tail
end
of
each
sip
being
a
crisp
dry
and
sweet
beer
this
is
easy
to
sip
i
did
not
like
the
slightly
chalky
earthy
texture
it
had
especially
in
the
finish
a
bottle
of
this
was
all
i
really
wanted
a
good
beer
filled
with
flavor
and
interesting
aromas
but
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
greats
in
this
style
like
unibroue
this
is
an
interesting
beer
very
strong
fruity
aroma
possibly
bananas
from
the
onset
throughout
the
entire
bottle
pours
into
the
tulip
glass
with
a
yellowgolden
color
with
thick
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
overall
this
was
a
much
fruitier
beer
than
i
care
for
so
i
rated
the
flavor
at
only
a
6
however
i
can
see
how
women
or
fans
of
lambics
and
similar
beers
would
really
enjoy
this
served
from
what
is
probably
my
favorite
bottle
design
out
there
in
a
duvel
tulip
golden
amber
with
a
big
foaming
head
great
fruity
aroma
the
taste
is
incredible
crisp
a
little
bitter
and
yet
incredibly
sweet
nicely
carbonated
it
definitely
warrants
the
champagne
comparisons
some
other
bas
have
made
the
9
0
is
nicely
masked
this
is
a
very
easy
750
to
polish
off
before
you
even
realize
it
is
done
nice
mouthfeel
slight
creaminess
medium
body
highly
drinkable
refreshing
easy
session
beer
it
seems
like
the
draft
is
a
bit
more
tasteful
and
complex
than
the
bottles
ive
had
in
the
past
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
delicious
i
could
drink
my
weight
with
beer
of
course
that
is
if
i
didnt
pass
out
after
my
first
10
the
bottle
version
makes
it
heavier
and
sweeter
than
your
ordinary
belgian
pale
ale
its
a
great
beer
for
conversing
with
fellow
baers
aromas
are
solidly
sweet
of
malts
and
sugars
form
other
sources
spices
belgian
yeast
fruity
and
alcohol
colors
are
strong
yellowstraw
and
vigorously
carbonated
and
retained
its
head
well
tastes
sweet
with
malt
and
honey
maybe
some
wheat
thrown
in
spicy
and
hot
from
fermentation
and
spice
addition
makes
the
beer
peppery
and
prickly
to
the
mouth
fruitiness
reminds
me
of
lemonheads
candy
with
tartness
of
grapefruit
pears
and
underripe
cherries
the
body
is
mediumfull
would
be
full
but
thinned
by
the
alcohol
the
carbonation
numbs
the
mouth
except
for
the
fusal
alcohol
flavors
which
are
a
bit
much
finishes
with
a
cotton
candy
sweetness
and
alcoholic
warmth
the
beer
makes
a
serious
punch
is
drank
in
the
summertime
but
warms
nicely
in
the
winter
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down
well
high
abv
limits
it
to
one
per
session
semiclear
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
fluffy
bigbubbled
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
over
the
beer
balanced
comforting
aroma
with
apples
grasses
and
pepper
starts
sweet
then
gives
way
to
faintly
sour
fruits
on
the
midpalate
and
honey
at
the
end
finish
is
dry
and
warm
with
alcohol
mouthfilling
carbonation
provides
the
illusion
that
this
is
a
heavy
bodied
beer
these
flavors
are
well
integrated
throughout
this
is
a
smooth
deceptively
strong
beer
that
deserves
the
fame
it
has
although
not
just
based
on
its
name
and
image
the
spice
character
and
hop
flavor
are
nicegood
example
of
the
style
a
very
fruity
smell
with
a
very
low
hop
presence
somewhat
of
a
light
yellow
in
appearance
off
white
head
with
laceing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
fruity
type
of
taste
somewhat
of
a
semisweet
taste
medium
in
bitterness
no
harsh
aftertaste
goes
down
smoothly
leaving
a
very
light
dryness
in
your
mouth
high
carbonation
very
bubbly
this
is
my
first
strong
belgian
ale
will
drink
this
again
but
will
look
into
other
similiar
styles
excellent
beer
here
would
pair
nicely
with
a
turkey
on
the
grill
smooth
fluffy
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dry
and
warming
drank
this
beer
on
the
terrace
overlooking
a
canal
in
vlaardingen
holland
on
a
recent
business
trip
hmm
i
have
to
say
for
a
tripel
style
beer
especially
one
of
this
reputation
i
was
let
me
down
perhaps
it
was
due
to
my
own
expectations
the
colour
was
nice
and
presentable
not
too
rich
in
the
orange
hues
like
other
tripels
nor
was
it
hazy
like
i
had
expected
i
dont
know
if
it
was
due
to
the
temperature
i
drank
it
at
as
it
was
slighlty
chilled
but
the
carbonation
seemed
to
dominate
the
taste
almost
like
carbonated
water
i
dont
know
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
although
i
did
end
up
buying
a
nice
box
set
with
4
of
these
bottles
and
2
nice
serving
glasses
so
i
am
willing
to
give
it
a
second
chance
purely
because
i
have
heardread
a
great
deal
of
good
things
about
it
although
my
first
impression
yielded
me
giving
this
beer
an
almost
average
score
a
standard
for
the
style
pink
elephants
go
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
goblet

this
particular
beer

with
about
12
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
over
34mins
noted
earthy
tones
noted
with
hints
of
cloves
this
carries
over
to
taste
wiht
earthy
flavors
noted
along
with
estery
flavors
that
dominate
no
real
hop
flavor
noted
this
beer
provides
a
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
noticable
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
rather
smooth
tasting
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
that
increases
the
enjoyablity
a
highly
recommends
belgian
overall
kind
of
a
shame
that
the
taste
is
so
bold
it
bullies
the
nose
a
bit
after
the
first
sip
seems
like
the
aroma
doesnt
have
much
of
a
chance
the
more
carbonation
i
work
out
of
it
the
more
that
element
appeals
to
me
really
dont
notice
the
level
of
alcohol
at
all
even
though
i
suspect
its
involvement
in
some
of
the
spicy
finish
appearance
was
a
goldenstraw
color
with
yeast
floating
around
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
surprised
by
the
amount
of
head
given
the
high
alcohol
content
smell
was
clovelike
with
hints
of
bananas
and
some
mild
citrus
also
detected
some
sournesssweatlike
funk
to
it
in
the
background
kind
of
like
what
you
would
expect
with
brettanomyces
but
not
as
upfront
nice
spicy
taste
with
banana
flavors
a
very
german
wheat
beerlike
profile
to
it
but
with
some
other
flavors
going
on
frothy
on
the
mouth
with
moderate
body
given
the
high
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
you
do
not
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
kudos
on
the
bottle
design
very
drinkable
to
the
point
of
making
this
one
a
dangerous
brew
as
the
high
a
b
v
and
the
pleasent
flavor
keep
one
wanting
more
pours
a
cloudy
weizeny

delirium
yum
please
run
this
past
me
again
in
my
notes
i
gave
this
beer
a
overall
or
5
i
really
like
this
beer
is
very
good
can
not
go
wrong
on
a
final
note
the
dregs
of
this
beer
though
unlike
most
ive
seen
do
contain
quite
a
bit
of
yeasty
goodness
probably
better
off
swirling
this
sucker
and
enjoying
them
throughout
the
beer
rather
than
leaving
them
for
the
finish
eh
live
and
learn
must
be
the
lesson
of
the
pink
elephant
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
a
local
restaurant
it
was
served
in
stemmed
trappist
glass
flavor
which
is
the
undeniable
highlight
of
this
beer
was
fruity
spicy
and
distinctive
aroma
was
good
appearance
adequate
yet
undistictive
and
palate
feel
was
velvety
and
smooth
would
have
again
on
draft
not
sure
about
in
bottle
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
here
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
strong
yeast
and
alcohol
flavors
as
well
as
the
high
price
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
the
first
time
was
so
much
better
less
yeast
and
alcohol
and
more
fruit
with
a
delicious
malty
backbone
i
dont
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
do
think
there
are
some
inconsistencies
between
batches
the
taste
has
a
light
malt
sweetness
to
it
that
is
mostly
drowned
out
by
all
of
the
other
flavors
found
in
this
beer
which
is
a
long
way
of
saying
that
this
beer
tastes
fairly
dry
there
is
a
nice
level
of
yeast
fermentation
derived
spiciness
here
as
well
i
get
light
notes
of
clove
a
certain
ginger
note
and
a
pepperlike
note
that
combines
with
the
carbonation
layers
of
fruit
character
are
also
found
here
with
apple
and
pear
being
prominent
along
with
a
sort
of
fruitreminiscent
tartness
that
is
also
found
in
these
fruits
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
tad
i
begin
to
get
some
notes
of
hot
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
almost
adds
to
the
perceived
spiciness
of
this
beer
and
actually
is
not
all
that
detracting
this
is
definitely
enjoyable
but
something
seems
a
bit
out
of
whack
which
keeps
this
beer
from
being
stellar
very
tasty
a
bit
more
yeasty
and
watery
than
most
of
my
favorite
begians
but
im
not
sure
thats
the
point
of
this
one
its
exceedingly
drinkable
and
its
9
abv
hence
the
name
right
drink
up
start
trembling
definitely
worth
revisiting
in
the
future
drinkability
oh
definitely
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
i
thought
id
be
looking
at
another
hohum
syrupy
sugary
bspa
what
i
got
was
a
unique
and
thoroughly
refreshing
crisp
tart
saison
wannabe
id
never
been
too
intrigued
by
this
one
but
very
much
enjoyed
it
ill
be
back
light
pale
amber
color
poured
with
a
generous
fluffy
head
lots
of
yeasties
floating
around
producing
a
rather
opaque
shade
aromas
are
intensely
fruity
with
lots
of
sweet
oranges
esters
and
some
dried
figs
in
the
background
bubbling
in
my
mouth
is
a
nice
light
body
of
a
brew
flavors
of
bready
malt
a
little
of
the
fruits
yeast
and
a
nice
alcohol
twang
at
end
finishes
rather
dry
this
is
quite
enjoyable
truer
to
style
i
imagine
than
the
other
americanized
belgian
style
beers
i
want
a
bit
more
complexity
to
this
beer
perhaps
some
more
sweetness
body
something
but
i
cant
quite
describe
it
would
make
a
perfect
ending
to
any
meal
the
flavor
delivers
the
same
complexity
to
the
point
of
masking
detection
of
some
of
the
components
spiced
apples
and
citrus
fruits
stand
out
at
times
as
does
the
slight
hop
profile
it
holds
a
slightly
earthy
tone
very
good
flavor
highly
recommended
notes
an
extremely
interesting
beer
it
was
hard
for
me
to
pin
down
the
experience
and
put
it
into
words
but
it
was
a
good
one
a
must
try
if
you
ask
me
d
definetly
an
interesting
belgian
that
i
would
put
on
par
with
the
only
other
bspa
ive
had
la
fin
du
monde
something
that
i
would
buy
again
i
would
like
to
try
some
of
this
companies
seasonals
its
beautiful
it
really
is
it
looks
just
like
dark
champagne
in
my
glass
the
color
of
a
big
aged
chardonnaya
champagne
that
retains
a
big
white
head
that
could
be
egg
whites
whipped
to
a
froth
lots
of
excited
bubbles
in
this
one
and
the
beautiful
light
color
of
the
nectar
im
beholding
showcases
them
perfectly
even
as
i
was
pouring
i
unintentially
caught
the
aroma
of
this
babyi
smelled
that
familiar
sweet
belgian
smell
has
that
citrusy
fresh
smell
that
screams
stop
smelling
me
and
get
me
on
your
tongue
i
obeyed
im
not
the
biggest
fan
in
the
world
of
the
wheaty
taste
of
wits
and
belgian
strongs
but
im
loving
this
and
know
something
good
when
i
meet
it
and
this
is
good
the
head
is
receding
now
im
about
halfway
through
the
glass
but
has
maintained
a
good
solid
sheet
of
foamy
love
about
2
mm
thick
across
the
surface
and
a
few
thin
tendrils
lacing
the
glass
on
the
side
ive
been
drinking
from
still
lots
of
bubbles
still
delicious
its
not
as
sweet
as
some
belgians
and
seems
to
have
found
a
great
balance
the
justenough
hops
backs
it
up
and
the
alcohol
hardly
seems
present
its
very
light
yet
coats
my
whole
mouth
like
a
most
comfortable
favorite
blanket
and
surprisingly
its
not
overcarbonated
at
all
inspite
of
the
frizzante
thing
it
has
going
on
in
my
glass
i
cant
believe
how
easy
its
going
down
this
could
be
dangerous
itd
be
easy
to
forget
they
hid
8
5
in
there
somewhere
i
recommend
trying
the
delirium
beers
not
only
because
they
taste
great
but
because
theyre
clever
too
the
label
clearly
states
that
its
been
brewed
since
the
1600s
but
if
they
had
those
cool
painted
bottles
back
then
i
would
have
been
one
happy
serf

with
a
thick
white
head
that
has
staying
power
nose
is
fruity
and
yeasty
with
plenty
of
spices
palate
is
on
the
sweeter
side
fruity
and
lots
of
cloves
citrus
and
peppery
flavors
slight
bitterness
that
is
pleasant
very
highly
carbonated
and
almost
fizzy
i
prefer
the
nocturnum
for
sure
but
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
golden
id
definitely
recommend
you
give
it
a
swirl
and
a
whirl
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
cap
this
cap
was
gone
quickly
and
left
almost
no
lacings
smell
was
great
filled
with
bananas
cloves
and
diacetyl
a
little
grainy
the
flavor
was
cloves
banana
and
peppery
with
pungeant
hops
crisp
carbonation
right
off
with
a
mediumlight
body
nice
dry
finish
good
beer
that
i
will
have
again
ive
never
been
that
big
a
belgian
drinker
but
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
you
should
too
a
wonderfully
sweet
taste
hints
of
fruit
and
bubble
gum
color
this
beer
strongly
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
very
smooth
clean
tingly
with
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
body
and
keep
far
away
from
the
cloyingly
sugary
tag
that
could
happen
very
drinkable
just
not
when
paying
bar
prices
why
dont
i
drink
this
more
often
had
this
one
at
a
european
beer
bar
in
downtown
melbourne
bottle
had
four
cool
looking
elephants
dancing
around
the
label
anyway
the
beer
poured
a
very
enticing
cool
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
into
a
sniffer
smell
was
wonderful
there
were
many
different
fruit
aromas
going
on
each
one
not
overpowering
but
just
right
if
you
can
imagine
fruit
salad
in
a
beer
then
you
get
the
idea
there
was
also
a
slight
spicyness
that
strangely
enough
complimented
the
fruit
smells
very
well
taste
was
also
very
good
pretty
big
hop
presence
with
fruit
flavors
going
wild
the
only
thing
that
i
wasnt
thrilled
with
was
the
carbonation
which
was
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
drinkability
was
pretty
damn
good
but
i
think
the
alcohol
could
be
a
factor
considering
that
after
one
i
felt
a
bit
buzzed
final
verdict
a
very
nice
beer
definetly
worth
a
try
apparently
the
title
means
the
shakes
you
get
after
a
long
night
of
drinking
veddy
veddy
clever
cheers
d
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
pleasantly
disguised
if
im
having
a
belgian
beer
delirium
tremens
is
pretty
much
the
one
for
me
i
prefer
it
to
all
the
other
big
name
belgians
and
the
american
made
belgians
as
well
overall
an
excellent
beer
recommended
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
however
well
balanced
and
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
beer
so
gotta
be
constructive
now
ill
surely
drink
another
and
if
i
get
lucky
and
its
not
overly
carbonated
it
might
just
be
a
great
beer
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
with
a
decent
white
head
on
it
the
color
is
a
fairly
clear
darker
golden
color
the
nose
is
a
bit
spicy
with
notes
of
breadiness
and
bananas
the
taste
is
a
bit
tarter
than
i
expected
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
with
a
touch
of
a
dry
aftertaste
a
hint
of
clove
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
also
a
decent
brew
not
quite
up
to
duvel
drinkability
top
5
belgian
pale
imo
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
face
like
some
do
which
is
not
bad
or
good
although
this
has
been
aged
a
good
year
plus
so
who
knows
how
it
tastes
fresh
will
have
to
find
out
sometime
in
the
future
very
recommended
i
got
this
beer
purely
because
of
the
name
im
drinking
it
in
celebration
of
begining
my
second
attempt
at
a
decent
home
brew
this
stuff
poors
a
pale
straw
yellow
and
sports
a
energetic
but
shortlived
head
smells
of
spice
and
yeast
which
is
a
winning
combinitation
in
this
case
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
is
sweeter
than
average
with
flavors
of
apple
and
spice
nice
balanced
hop
profile
that
really
compliments
the
sweetness
im
glad
to
see
that
the
elaborate
bottle
is
not
all
there
is
to
it
definitely
worth
the
8
note
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
the
abv
is
stated
as
85
vol
not
the
9abv
cited
at
the
top
of
the
page
this
is
a
fine
beer
fine
like
wine
though
compared
to
beer
wine
is
not
fine
but
you
get
the
point
goes
down
really
easy
so
drinkability
is
high
sweet
stuff
beautiful
hazy
gold
in
colora
huge
head
on
top
that
just
begs
to
be
compared
to
whipped
cream
really
a
pretty
glass
of
beer
good

slight

somewhat

in
spots
but
nice
drying

metallic
at
times
great
bodyvery
bright
and
lively
on
the
palate
really
a
great
beer
i
first
had
this
in
1995
or
so
as
i
remember
and
was
so
blown
away
then
still
a
classic
in
my
book
this
ominous
beer
was
a
pale
golden
colour
quite
fizzy
and
with
a
decent
head
the
nose
had
some
interesting
characters
such
as
bubble
gum
and
light
banana
and
pepper
scents
certainly
yeast
influenced
and
interesting
the
taste
was
pleasantly
sweet
with
a
candi
sugar
base
the
other
flavours
were
much
the
same
as
the
nose
with
the
aforementioned
bubble
gum
and
banana
impressions
some
pepper
and
clove
hints
fairly
complex
this
beer
was
wet
and
round
without
much
bitterness
mouthfeel
medium
somewhat
fluffed
by
fiz
and
malt
variety
it
approached
creaminess
at
times
drinkability
was
good
characteristic
belgian
traits
made
this
quite
interesting
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
am
unsure
how
good
of
a
session
beer
this
would
make
the
flavor
is
wonderful
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
too
amny
of
there
and
you
might
down
for
the
count
this
beer
is
great
thanks
tommy
for
hooking
me
up
with
it
this
beer
is
not
worth
the
money
in
my
opinion
i
paid
4
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
it
is
good
just
not
great
the
fruitiness
is
great
and
it
almost
tastes
like
champagne
but
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
good
but
not
great
750
ml
bottle
corked
caged
and
wrapped
in
foil
delirium
tremens
has
a
clear
bright
orange
color
with
a
big
head
lots
of
carbonation
just
a
bit
of
floaties
sweet
aroma
of
juicy
fruits
with
orange
peels
and
spices
fruity
and
spicy
flavor
orange
coriander
and
pepper
not
as
malty
as
i
expected
the
spices
are
a
bit
much
and
there
is
some
medicinal
flavor
abv
is
noticably
high
but
it
hides
behind
a
strong
spritzy
carbonation
a
tasty
but
flawed
beer
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
have
another
maybe
i
let
it
sit
to
long
sigh
next
up
la
fin
du
monde
served
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
champagne
cork
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
color
topped
by
a
huge
thick
creamy
white
head
ample
carbonation
just
keeps
on
coming
aroma
primarily
of
belgian
ale
yeast
with
notes
of
clove
banana
and
confectioners
sugar
palate
is
a
tad
delicate
tasty
yes
but
individual
flavors
are
difficult
to
discern
light
sweet
malt
melds
with
the
assertive
yeast
yielding
sweet
bready
notes
with
light
spice
clove
banana
a
touch
of
pepper
body
is
nice
creamy
and
a
touch
buttery
the
substantial
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
the
palate
but
gradually
builds
on
the
finish
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
special
occasion
beers
and
since
im
celebrating
the
completion
of
paperwork
for
my
new
job
tonight
i
thought
id
break
it
out
a
real
treat
indeed
i
also
drank
a
750ml
of
this
on
new
years
eve
a
friend
of
mine
who
does
not
drink
alcohol
at
all
drank
and
enjoyed
a
glass
of
this
while
i
finished
off
the
bottle
a
nice
celebration
beer
for
me
the
carbonation
that
i
really
like
in
this
kind
of
ale
brings
this
one
down
a
bit
and
as
it
warms
theres
an
unpleasant
estery
alcohol
bite
what
i
want
to
say
but
should
restrain
myself
from
saying
is
that
this
reminds
me
of
duvel
but
is
a
little
less
refined
in
appearance
flavor
and
presentation
worth
trying
if
just
for
the
fact
that
you
can
joke
about
the
name
and
bottle
with
friends
dark
gold
color
with
an
enormous
head
of
oily
foam
abundant
spices
both
in
the
aroma
taste
cloves
and
coriander
have
their
way
with
it
the
belgian
yeast
runs
rampant
in
this
puppy
as
well
somehow
the
wide
array
of
yeasts
spices
and
thick
malts
come
together
to
make
a
pretty
damn
good
strong
belgian
ale
fresh
ontap
this
is
a
very
solid
belgian
though
i
must
say
i
didnt
see
any
pink
elephants
salud
this
one
had
a
nice
large
head
of
foam
a
partially
cloudy
yellow
with
an
orange
tinge
it
looked
like
the
rhine
of
of
a
grapefruit
in
color
the
smell
is
fruity
with
some
citrus
flavors
and
maybe
banana
too
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
fruity
and
tarty
not
very
bitter
at
the
finish
it
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
loads
of
bubbly
carbonation
the
9
alcohol
is
well
concealed
not
the
best
of
its
class
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
great
belgian
ale
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
the
mouthfeel
here
is
great
i
really
do
like
it
it
compliments
the
sparkling
grape
juice
flavor
it
feels
just
like
sparkling
grape
juice
in
the
mouth
however
i
think
that
if
the
carbonation
were
a
bit
and
just
a
bit
stronger
so
that
it
would
last
longer
in
the
mouth
and
tickle
the
tongue
a
bit
more
it
would
add
to
the
beer
this
beer
also
finishes
dry
now
that
i
sit
here
after
a
few
minutes
without
a
sip
and
think
about
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
when
i
see
this
again
i
think
ill
grab
another
one
just
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
when
not
in
the
mood
also
dont
think
that
i
could
drink
to
much
of
it
in
one
sitting
drinkabilityoverall
great
beer
quite
strong
and
bitey
more
of
an
advanced
tasting
beer
cheers
the
bottle
is
really
great
looking
i
like
the
pink
elephants
and
lizards
the
amber
bottle
is
painted
to
look
like
stone
or
ceramics
dt
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
head
shrinks
down
to
12
inch
and
hangs
in
there
some
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
begins
as
soon
as
the
cap
starts
to
bend
under
the
opener
by
the
time
you
pour
it
into
the
glass
the
aroma
something
like
a
hefe
weizen
is
very
pronounced
this
is
my
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
thought
dt
tasted
very
much
like
a
hefe
there
is
a
citrus
and
astringent
taste
but
the
astringent
part
is
much
more
balanced
and
acceptable
than
any
hefe
i
have
had
i
did
not
notice
the
high
alcohol
from
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
heavy
or
light
if
i
didnt
know
and
respect
the
abv
i
would
consider
this
very
drinkable
especially
for
someone
who
likes
hefes
better
than
i
do
i
must
say
i
had
this
on
tap
this
time
but
every
time
in
the
past
when
ive
tried
a
bottle
there
were
huge
clumpy
yeast
balls
floating
around
in
it
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
citrus
overtone
spices
assert
themselves
quite
well
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
lingering
bitterness
on
the
palate
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
that
delirium
has
to
offer
drinkability
the
high
alcohol
and
price
is
a
tad
prohibitive
but
this
is
very
drinkable
would
be
great
to
serve
at
a
dinner
with
friends
strong
enough
to
stand
up
against
flavorful
foods
subtle
enough
to
not
be
intrusive
but
interesting
enough
to
raise
some
eyebrows
good
stuff
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
sometime
soon
good
beer
that
had
a
nice
lasting
impression
on
my
palate
definitely
not
the
first
thing
to
have
in
a
drinking
session
as
for
my
first
bspa
i
will
definitely
search
out
some
others
because
i
am
quite
impressed
by
the
style
aftertaste
was
bitter
but
this
faded
away
pretty
fast
opinion
when
you
get
a
beer
like
this
it
is
hard
to
classify
it
it
is
in
the
same
category
as
duvel
but
it
is
in
no
way
a
duvel
clone
this
beer
is
flavorful
while
it
has
a
reserved
aroma
it
is
really
clean
but
i
am
afraid
that
this
beer
may
be
oxidizing
a
bit
to
make
the
dry
chalky
flavor
more
noticeable
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
would
like
to
look
for
a
fresher
example
drinkability
this
beer
fits
nicely
into
the
style
it
is
strong
but
very
drinkable
provided
that
you
have
a
designated
driver
i
encourage
the
drinker
to
allow
the
beer
to
warm
up
a
bit
to
room
temperature
as
it
brings
a
whole
new
level
of
taste
to
the
beer
taste
cloves
and
spices
a
little
lemony
citrus
followed
by
that
barnyard
hay
and
finishing
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
but
gets
a
bit
of
a
hit
due
to
a
little
to
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
these
if
they
were
available
in
my
area
uf
its
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
dryness
and
carbonation
but
rewarding
enough
to
keep
working
on
i
wonder
how
itd
stack
up
after
being
aged
ah
what
a
special
beer
beautiful
yellow
to
orangeamber
color
with
an
enormous
thick
rocky
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
heady
alcohol
with
yeast
sweet
malt
and
more
alcohol
it
is
heady
and
wonderful
drinkability
is
hurt
a
little
by
the
booze
especially
if
it
warms
too
much
but
dont
drink
it
too
cold
either
wonderful
stuff
really
perhaps
not
the
most
graceful
alcohol
in
the
world
but
very
enjoyable
pours
a
light
yellowishorange
with
a
thick
and
i
mean
thick
watch
how
you
pour
this
head
that
settles
down
to
a
12
finger
covering
wow
higher
than
expected
carbonation
tons
of
bubbles
endlessly
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
candysweet
fruity
taste
is
malty
with
some
hints
of
banana
clove
thrown
in
very
lively
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
some
alcohol
bitterness
on
the
swallow
very
smooth
and
almost
too
drinkable
for
an
8
5
abv
belgian
i
may
be
seeing
those
pink
elephants
sooner
than
i
thought
damned
good
stuff
dance
with
the
pink
elephants
as
you
enjoy
this
brew
pours
a
light
reddishbrown
color
with
not
much
head
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
seems
to
change
from
moment
to
moment
i
can
smell
candy
spice
and
fruit
but
all
at
different
sips
and
sip
you
should
because
the
9
abv
will
trample
you
like
a
herd
of
elephants
joey
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
something
id
make
a
regular
in
my
rotation
if
i
could
afford
to
do
so
a
belgian
beer
strong
like
a
fruity
powerful
beer
like
most
of
the
belgian
strong
beers
beer
with
generous
cuantity
of
alcohol
good
like
an
appetizer
for
cheese
and
german
cuisine
in
general
a
superior
belgian
beer
full
bodied
try
serve
in
a
goblet
glass
90
recommended
the
taste
is
a
slightly
sweeter
extension
of
the
nose
the
candi
sugar
is
on
the
forefront
with
some
funky
malty
and
yeasty
flavors
followed
by
a
herbal
grassy
hop
very
little
bitterness
despite
the
hoppiness
but
has
a
dry
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
has
a
very
creamy
body
and
coats
the
mouth
for
an
even
drier
alcohol
burn
this
is
a
good
one
to
enjoy
as
the
weather
begins
to
cool
down
overall
ive
had
better
belgian
strong
pale
ales
but
id
choose
this
over
lots
of
other
beers
in
a
heart
beat
wish
i
had
some
fine
cuisine
to
go
with
this
tasty
brew
instead
i
am
dining
on
kraft
mac
cheese
alas
such
is
the
life
of
a
ba
in
college
drinkability
it
improved
as
i
got
through
it
but
im
afraid
that
this
one
is
not
really
for
me
the
special
bonus
was
no
tangy
aftertaste
like
it
was
sitting
for
too
long
or
was
stored
in
a
tin
can
nice
clear
crisp
perfect
overall
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
hidden
high
abv
to
it
great
taste
and
such
a
smoothness
that
not
all
belgians
can
do
great
beer
it
kept
evoking
thoughts
of
grapefruit
a
hint
of
tartness
bitterness
smooths
out
and
does
not
linger
of
course
classic
belgian
yeast
flavors
this
is
pretty
much
the
definitive
example
of
the
style
for
me
i
pick
one
of
these
up
nearly
every
time
i
travel
since
we
dont
have
these
in
al
because
of
arcane
beer
laws
yadda
yadda
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
strength
of
this
brew
embarrassing
that
i
had
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
since
i
drink
it
quiet
often
flavor
is
very
different
when
it
is
served
on
tap
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
well
balanced
for
its
size
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
good
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
flavors
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
complex
theres
no
real
spiciness
to
speak
of
but
its
still
recommended
as
for
the
taste
very
very
not
bad
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
you
can
barely
taste
the
8
7
alcohol
content
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
complex
with
numerous
fruity
textures
involved
its
moderately
carbonated
with
a
clean
and
refreshing
aftertaste
this
is
one
id
definitely
recommend
and
one
that
id
definitely
pick
up
again
much
paler
and
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
as
for
the
9
abv
but
do
not
believe
it
could
not
find
a
hint
of
it
in
the
beer
served
in
a
10
5oz
goblet
it
poured
very
pale
gold
very
similar
to
apple
juice
no
head
and
no
visible
carbonation
however
there
was
just
the
slightest
of
carbonation
that
made
this
beer
extremely
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
dry
and
crisp
finish
flavor
was
sweet
malts
at
first
without
any
recognizeable
hops
picked
up
just
whiffs
of
a
lot
of
other
flavors
such
as
honey
cloves
pepper
lemon
yeast
and
fruit
apples
threw
the
glass
down
far
quicker
than
i
intended
33cl
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
apricot
color
and
makes
a
fluffy
white
head
lacing
cascades
down
my
glass
with
very
compact
dense
bubbles
drifting
down
as
i
imbibe
this
strong
yeast
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
light
peppery
spice
flavor
with
coriander
lemon
yeast
and
alcohol
medium
to
full
palate
with
peppery
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
excellent
strong
pale
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
fact
that
it
was
elected
the
greatest
beer
ever
is
up
for
debate
but
it
was
quite
good
drinkability
is
good
nice
have
had
before
but
havent
reviewed
not
the
best
but
drinkable
plus
good
and
dangerous
at
9
drinkability
suffers
a
little
due
to
high
alcohol
and
again
this
bottle
wasnt
as
drinkagle
as
id
remembered
ill
write
another
review
the
next
time
i
have
the
beer
overall
not
a
bad
one
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
i
dont
think
this
one
hangs
up
there
with
the
duvels
of
the
world
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
but
its
not
going
to
become
my
goto
i
will
however
add
into
the
equation
that
other
exotic
beers
ive
had
from
this
liquor
store
have
not
consistently
been
fresh
so
i
am
definitely
willing
to
give
it
a
second
chance
though
i
am
not
willing
to
shell
out
another
8
for
2
beers
for
8
i
wish
i
had
purchased
unibroues
fin
du
monde
or
maredsous
drinkability
though
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
think
its
surely
one
of
the
best
available
its
in
line
pricewise
with
other
belgians
of
the
style
and
its
certainly
worth
a
shot
either
for
a
caged
and
corked
bottle
or
a
4pack
overall
another
slightly
disappointing
delirium
although
a
good
beer
there
are
others
in
this
style
that
in
my
opinion
shine
a
little
bit
brighter
ill
let
a
bottle
of
this
sit
a
year
and
see
what
i
think
then
but
anyways
a
good
try
but
overall
not
my
favorite
plus
kickass
bottle
d
this
beer
is
a
workout
for
the
senses
very
complex
in
taste
and
smell
and
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
to
date
highly
recommended
a
brilliant
pale
ale
11
2
oz
bottle
capped
and
foiled
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
big
billowy
fizzy
head
good
lacing
as
well
aroma
is
spicy
and
alcoholic
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
quite
spicy
with
pepper
clove
and
coriander
duking
it
out
some
fruity
orange
rind
white
grape
character
as
well
finish
is
quick
slightly
bitter
and
boozy
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
will
really
sneak
up
on
you
this
definitely
lives
up
to
its
balls
out
reputation
maybe
a
little
too
effervescent
i
wonder
what
would
happen
to
this
one
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
the
drinkability
of
this
monster
beer
is
limited
because
the
moderation
required
in
enjoying
it
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
full
enough
for
the
style
but
the
abv
and
awkwardness
of
flavors
almost
kill
the
drinkability
pours
a
pale
hazy
gold
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
and
2
fingers
of
white
dense
head
and
excellent
retention
smell
is
fruityapple
skins
pears
citrus
spicy
coriander
and
a
slight
bandaid
scent
taste
is
light
and
fruity
tasting
like
green
apples
melon
and
pears
with
a
slight
tartness
in
the
middle
giving
way
to
a
nice
spicy
clove
finish
a
slight
alcohol
warming
is
present
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
for
a
refreshing
feel
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
awfully
pricey
and
theres
several
other
belgian
pale
ales
i
think
are
a
better
value
thanks
for
sharing
gabe
very
clear
golden
colour
topped
by
a
fluffy
bright
white
head
that
receded
quickly
to
a
ring
spicy
aroma
with
cloves
some
pepper
honey
and
a
little
alcohol
light
texture
with
ample
carbonation

with

plenty

with

alcohol
warming
is
quite
strong
but
not
overpowering
or
harsh
finishes
with
some
dryness
and
hop
character
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
and
one
that
enjoyed
quite
a
lot
oh
my
how
times
have
changed
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
very
smooth
silky
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
makes
this
dance
on
my
tongue
feels
great
and
slowly
warms
you
up
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
really
very
sneaky
tastyness
quite
drinkable
id
say
not
a
gulper
but
not
really
a
sipper
either
somewhere
in
the
middle
a
very
refreshing
tasty
brew
god
bless

mmmm
interesting
had
to
have
two
to
get
the
measure
of
this
one
looks
amazing

on
the

plus
strong

not
unpleasant
though
taste
has
a
very
dry
finish
but
the
abv
while
apparent
is
hidden
well
palate
is
just
right
for
me
plenty
of
fine
carbonation
results
in
a
light
touch
and
accentuates
the
flavours
competent
bspa
and
very
yummy
cheers
mouthfeel
dry
and
sticky
on
the
palate
very
nice
and
comfortable
drinkability
good
i
usually
cant
drink
more
than
one
belgian
at
a
time
but
i
think
i
could
with
this
one
this
beer
is
the
reason
i
began
seriously
investigating
craft
brew
and
found
ba
in
the
first
place
i
could
drink
delerium
tremens
all
day
but
my
day
would
be
awfully
short
if
i
tried
i
love
the
stonewarelook
bottle
and
the
cartoony
colorful
label
complete
with
pink
elephants
and
green
sunglassesbedecked
alligators
craft
beer
should
be
fun
and
its
great
to
see
such
a
funloving
silly
ass
label
delirium
tremens
impressed
me
more
than
i
thought
it
would
its
a
wonderful
bspa
and
is
one
that
ill
be
sure
to
buy
again
whenever
i
have
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
is
robust
thanks
to
the
ohsogenerous
grain
bill
and
the
finish
is
classic
belgian
with
a
yeast
profile
fading
into
nothing
more
than
an
invitation
to
enjoy
another
sip
good
mouthfeel
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
very
quaffable
i
would
absolutely
recommend
it
to
anyone
thanks

very
clean
and
subtle

up

banana

this
is
a
very
good
beer
if
not
too
subtle
but
good
flavors
and
extremely
drinkable
almost
anythin
i
would
look
for
in
a
bspa
not
a
bad
strong
golden
ale
but
not
particularly
distinguished
either
a
bit
plain
and
overly
sweet
without
balancing
dryness
or
depth
very
nice
fizzy
champagne
body
and
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
love
duvel
and
i
love
duponts
avec
les
bons
veoux
more
still
a
solid
representative
of
the
strong
golden
ale
style
pours
out
golden
colored
with
a
big
white
head
huge
aroma
spicy
and
fruity
all
at
the
same
time
truly
a
great
smelling
beer
the
taste
doesnt
let
you
down
either
plenty
of
citrus
taste
with
some
pepper
mixed
in
as
well
the
alcohol
does
not
go
unoticed
it
does
leave
the
inside
of
your
mouth
a
little
hot
still
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
i
loved
the
bottle
so
much
that
i
asked
the
waitress
if
i
could
bring
it
home
with
me
actually
it
was
more
me
telling
her
that
i
was
bringing
it
home
with
me
and
she
complied
haha
in
my
book
belgian
beers
come
second
to
german
beer
only
and
this
is
a
bias
on
my
part
since
i
am
from
a
german
family
regradles
of
this
bias
belgian
beers
are
definetly
worth
a
try
by
any
beer
aficianado
the
packaging
is
definetly
a
plus
in
comparison
to
most
american
beers
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
and
the
brussels
lace
is
maintained
for
only
a
few
short
minutes
the
taste
is
fruity
than
most
but
compared
to
other
beers
i
have
sampled
delirium
meets
my
par
standards
for
a
belgian
brewed
beer
regardless
of
my
biased
sentiments
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
by
any
wannabe
beer
advocate
something
i
would
by
for
a
second
try
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
that
really
doesnt
warn
you
of
the
true
strength
of
this
brew
comes
in
a
funky
fake
stoneware
bottle
with
pink
elephants
and
green
alligators
on
the
label
a
decent
example
of
a
really
great
beer
style
a
very
nice
ale
with
a
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
apparent
but
doesnt
overpower
delish
poured
out
to
the
color

continued
to
rise
through
the
brew
well
after
being
poured
a
little
lace
was
noted
around
the
glass
scent
was
almost
like
champagne
with
a
slightly
vinegarlike
quality
flavors
of
hops
were
strong
as
were
notes
of
sugar
and
barley
dry
smooth
aftertaste
heavy
alcohol
quality
was
noted
as
this
brew
will
get
you
feelin
it
worth
a
try
but
a
bit
pricey
poured
an
apricot
colored
citrus
punch
looking
color
when
pouring
i
had
to
slow
it
down
to
avoid
too
much
head
the
head
is
thick
with
nice
retention
and
ample
lace
it
is
white
in
color
and
tops
off
a
cloudy
and
very
bubbly
brew
the
aroma
is
like
bananas
and
pineapple
very
pungeant
the
taste
is
very
fruity
and
mildly
sweet
the
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
palate
with
some
hints
of
hops
with
8
5abv
i
expected
more
of
an
alcohol
taste
but
only
detected
a
very
small
trace
i
could
only
drink
one
of
these
per
night
musky
orange
nose
faint
spices
smooth
honey
glides
over
the
tongue
then
a
biting
bitter
citrus
at
the
end
alcohol
also
hits
at
the
end
lingering
on
the
palate
for
a
while
i
cant
say
i
like
the
balance
here
or
lack
thereof
the
flavors
come
at
you
a
bit
randomly
and
awkwardly
that
said
this
is
a
fairly
nice
drinkable
ale
but
i
would
prefer
a
better
integration
of
the
flavors
decent
beer
but
id
say
its
only
for
fans
of
the
style
i
dont
see
it
gaining
converts
overall
delirium
tremens
is
a
good
beer
it
is
the
most
adventurous
belgian
ive
had
thus
far
i
have
had
my
horizons
expanded
slightly
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
much
ill
enjoy
beers
like
this
in
the
future
a
great
brew

not
enough
to
make
it
unpleasant
goes
down

and
continues
to
make
you
wonder
about
the

so
i
would
say
it
is
pretty
drinkable
even
with
the

good
one
to
try
tasted
of
fruit

which
danced
in

however
it
isnt
the
cheapest
of
beers
which
is
a
drawback
drinkability
exceptionnal
this
is
the
best
strong
beer
i
ever
reviewed
a
little
expensive
but
it
really
worthes
a
try

foamer

lcbo
removed
this
beer
from
its
inventory
in

continues
to
sell
it
even
if
they
left
most
of
the
beer
market
to
private
stores
thanks
god
note
to
myself
i
would
like
a
green
limon
with
this
beer
it
can
be
a
valuable
addition

at
the
southside

il
cloudy
yellow
with
a
fluffy

taste
is
tart
and
citrusy
more
so
than
one
expects
from
a
belgian
this
is
pretty
popular
among
the
belgian
beer
aficianados
in
my
area
im
a
little
surprised
that
i
havent
had
a
bigger
sample
by
now
let
it
be
known
that
i
bought
this
beer
for
the
novelty
specifically
because
the
liquor
control
board
of
ontario
thought
the
joke
was
offensive
and
stopped
selling
it
take
that
lcbo
it
turns
out
to
be
a
very
tasty
one
and
one
i
will
probably
come
back
to

into
a
wine
glass
it
pours
a
pale
honey
color
with
14
inch
of
head
with
some
edge
lacing
and
cling
the
ale
is
rather
hazy
also
aroma
is
interesting
i
get
the
sense
of
pineapples
along
with
some
citrus
tones
and
a
bit
of
yeast
not
overly
complex
but
lovely
flavors
is
bitey
yet
clean
with
a
fruity
citrus
flavor
with
a
bitter
finish
of
maybe
some
hops
and
yeast
at
the
cold
temp
it
is
served
the
carbonation
kills
some
of
the
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
is
still
pretty
decent
overall
it
is
a
yummy
brew
but
would
be
better
at
a
warmer
temp
one
of
the
most
beautiful
bottles
on
the
shelf
pours
cloudy
gold
until
the
yeast
calms
at

bazooka
bubblegum
sparkles
in
my
mouth
doesnt
sit
still
enough
for
me
to
fully
grasp
it
this
is
a
very
mellow
belgian
strong
ale
mouthfeel
very
light
body
clean
sweet
malt
finish
with
a
bitterness
that
gets
stronger
after
the
sip
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
very
powerful
beer
thats
kinda
hard
to
handle
the
alcohol
spicyness
is
over
the
top
if
thats
your
thing
this
is
our
beer
but
if
not
you
may
not
enjoy
it
the
drinkability
is
average
because
of
the
high
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
would
aging
help
i
dont
know
anyways
above
average
for
sure
comments
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
bet
it
would
be
better
fresh
i
prefer
unibroues
don
de
dieu
which
is
also
cheaper
but
this
stuff
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
truly
a
shame
that
i
cant
get
this
anymore
the
notorious
dt
bottle
fauxceramic
with
the
pink
elephants
and
the
blue
foil
on
the
neck
this
bottle
is
hard
to
miss
when
i
popped
the
cap
the
bottle
started
to
push
the
foam
to
the
top
rather
quickly
threatening
a
spillover
so
i
had
to
pour
quickly
a
nice
offwhite
head
leaving
thick
lace
on
the
distinctive
dt
glass
the
head
receded
rather
quickly
but
kept
itself
at
a
moderate
level
for
the
entire
drink
in
this
bottle
i
have
thick
murky
yeast
sediment
which
i
do
not
remember
when
i
had
this
last
colossal
chunks
of
yeast
floating
hmm
the
beer
is
dull
light
amber
hints
of
orange
massive
grapefruit
aroma
is
the
initial
smell
i
actually
quite
enjoy
the
aroma
sugary
peach
and
nectarine
with
some
spicy
clove
and
yeast
with
enough
light
caramel
malt
for
balance
i
also
smell
tomato
juice
and
brown
sugar
at
the
same
time
there
is
some
smell
which
is
offputting
to
me
which
i
cannot
quite
describe
the
flavour
does
the
aroma
no
justice
i
was
expecting
more
fruitiness
and
more
body
soapy
yeast
at
first
with
some
dryness
starting
in
the
middle
and
following
through
to
the
finish
leaving
very
little
aftertaste
citrusy
grapefruit
light
malt
some
hop
bittering
and
a
definite
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
definitely
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
mediumbodied
in
fact
it
tastes
quite
watery
for
a
strong
pale
ale
this
should
have
much
more
weight
in
the
mouth
medium
carbonation
dt
is
not
terribly
drinkable
with
the
yeast
mustiness
and
the
alcohol
not
quite
the
defining
example
for
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
class
despite
what
some
might
say
i
raise
my
glass
and
toast
to
all
the
ontarioans
who
cannot
enjoy
this
fine
ale
because
of
the
insensitivity
of
the
lcbo
drinkability
this
is
a
brew
to
contemplate
rather
than
to
drink
one
is
enough
for
a
quiet
evening
the
aroma
that
came
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
opened
it
was
disarming
like
no
other
beer
ive
smelled
it
was
a
sweet
fruity
candy
smell
with
some
notes
of
cider
the
head
was
bright
white
and
bubbly
which
showed
off
the
high
level
of
carbonation
the
first
taste
is
tart
and
cidery
followed
by
malt
flavors
more
complex
than
the
light
color
would
indicate
late
earthy
notes
of
the
yeast
lend
to
an
entertaining
finish
in
this
very
refreshing
brew
dt
is
a
favorite
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
i
have
to
drive
a
hundred
miles
to
get
it
the
bottle
looks
fantastic
the
ceramic
look
is
a
nice
touch
and
the
characters
on
the
blue
and
pink
label
are
so
creative
and
strange
awesome
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
get
this
do
not
second
guess
the
choice
bottled
in
the
330ml
painted
bottle
with
the
signature
pink
pachyderm
a
clear
blond
straw
color
fine
bubbled
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
floral
hopping
some
fruit
and
musty
yeast
very
champagnelike
in
smell
and
apperance
weakly
oily
palate
hops
are
subdued
in
the
body
sweetish
some
spritzyness
and
detectable
alcohol
that
leaves
a
yeastycider
impression
when
it
mingles
with
the
saaz
hops
and
finishes
rather
abruptly
with
not
much
after
taste
but
the
alcohol
warming
not
the
experience
i
expected
after
all
the
hype
taste
is
lightly
fruity
apples
plums
and
spicy
pepper
coriander
hints
of
lemon
dry
and
crisp
also
sour
toward
the
end
and
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
a
medium
bodied
ale
and
dry
pretty
good
stuff
although
i
am
not
overwhelmed
ill
buy
it
again
what
is
the
deal
with
the
pink
elephants
on
the
label
is
a
common
question
i
get
i
tell
folks
that
this
beer
is
from
amsterdam
and
is
spiked
with
lsd
while
this
is
not
true
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
makes
a
great
story
for
beer
luddites
stylish
opaque
bottle
whats
inside
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
whitish
head
that
laces
very
well
very
pleasing
aroma
of
cloves
cirtus
and
apples
taste
was
quite
complex
apples
cherries
spicy
on
the
exhale
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
and
bubbly
but
not
aggressive
this
is
a
very
good
beer
id
like
another
light
and
deceptive
in
terms
of
its
8
5abv
a
treat
and
an
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
complex
in
flavor
and
very
pleasant
all
around
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
after
the
first
sip
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
by
the
time
half
the
chalice
was
gone
i
was
really
enjoying
it
as
many
reviewers
of
this
brew
have
stated
i
expected
more
after
reading
many
recommendations
to
its
excellence
it
is
tasty
but
i
dont
care
for
the
phenolic
aftertaste
that
lingers
after
a
sip
perhaps
its
the
alcohol
that
overshadows
the
typical
belgium
complex
flavors
but
it
leaves
me
puzzled
the
mouthfeel
is
grainy
and
not
smooth
like
id
anticipated
too
bubbly
and
champaign
like
for
my
taste
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
malt
scent
with
a
dry
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
spicey
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
finish
that
warms
a
little
on
the
way
down
it
tastes
like
there
is
some
corriander
in
here
that
adds
a
slight
peppery
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
it
has
excellent
aroma
and
flavor
a
good
drinker
tasty
and
very
drinkable
at
8
5
abv
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
on
tap
at
redbones
this
came
out
of
the
tap
a
bright
clear
gold
good
light
white
head
with
champagne
like
bubbles
nice
lace
almost
as
if
on
nitro
light
floral
vanilla
aroma
great
vanilla
flavor
in
the
front
with
fruity
esters
in
the
middle
great
light
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
all
and
all
a
highly
recommended
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
with
a
thick
piece
of
steak
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
fine
example
of
a
belgian
ale
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
bbq
at
my
sisters
house
had
to
pour
it
into
a
normal
pint
glass
as
that
was
the
only
glass
available
the
glass
struggled
to
contain
a
massive
fluffy
white
head
this
head
rested
upon
an
appetizing
golden
color
smell
is
very
fruity
and
yeasty
with
some
spiciness
rounding
out
the
nose
taste
was
a
little
unbalanced
in
my
opinion
some
spicy
yeastiness
and
a
little
hoppiness
were
overwhelming
for
me
not
much
of
a
malt
base
or
fruity
esters
to
balance
out
the
flavor
profile
dont
get
me
wrong
i
still
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
just
like
for
it
to
become
more
well
rounded
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
is
drinkability
definately
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
belgian
pale
a
damn
fine
belgian
pale
crisp
fruity
with
some
nice
subtleties
i
will
visit
this
one
again
it
definitely
satisfies
a
certain
craving
dont
mistake
lack
of
hype
with
lack
of
substance
as
this
sits
sits
on
the
tongue
it
becomes
more
and
more
mellow
very
pleasing
mouthfeel
and
high
octane
aroma
a
beer
so
good
the
elephant
on
the
label
is
drunk
when
i
meet
people
who
have
never
tried
a
belgian
style
beer
before
this
is
the
first
thing
i
point
them
towards
it
has
a
pronounced
sweetness
and
fruit
character
to
it
pear
and
apple
and
a
solid
body
that
doesnt
really
feel
heavy
at
all
because
of
the
high
carbonation
great
out
of
the
bottle
and
fantastic
out
of
the
tap
in
moments
of
indecision
with
the
car
running
outside
the
liquor
store
and
only
moments
to
choose
grabbing
this
has
never
led
to
regret
all
in
all
a
good
easy
to
drink
easy
to
find
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
and
its
a
staple
around
the
nogood
household
the
taste
is
suprisingly
smooth
especially
considering
its
alcohol
content
i
can
tell
that
it
is
strong
but
not
in
a
burning
sence
more
like
a
pleasant
warming
i
was
pleased
to
find
little
clove
in
this
beer
and
ditto
on
the
phenols
there
is
a
subtle
almost
fruity
flavor
reminiscant
of
the
apples
from
the
cork
but
it
is
rather
subtle
and
i
think
it
blends
with
the
beer
nicely
this
one
pours
a
large
white
fizzy
head
on
top
of
a
cloudy
yellow
body
the
smell
is
musty
with
light
fruit
and
clove
the
mustiness
carries
over
into
the
flavor
where
is
detectible
along
with
some
hops
on
the
finish
the
rest
of
the
flavors
are
spicy
clove
at
first
and
some
alcohol
coupled
with
light
bitter
hops
in
the
middle
the
mouth
feel
is
lively
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
one
powerful
beer
not
only
in
alcohol
but
flavor
i
normally
like
my
belgians
to
be
a
little
more
mellowed
out
but
this
did
me
just
fine
its
raw
unrestrained
and
full
of
complexities
that
many
beers
even
some
belgians
are
not
highly
recommended
the
taste
was
dry
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
thick
and
grassy
lacking
some
subtlety
some
citrus
but
i
wanted
more
fruits
still
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
notes
makes
a
great
after
dinner
drink
great
beer
shouldve
bought
more
of
these
on
tap
pours
a
very
light
strawamber
color
a
bit
cloudy
white
delicate
head
leaving
classic
belgian
lacing
sugary
yeasty
spicey
nose
notes
of
apricots
raisins
candi
sugar
smoke
complex
and
interesting
stuff
alcohol
present
but
fairly
well
in
the
background
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
i
love
this
stuff
give
it
a
try
my
wife
still
refers
to
this
stuff
as
rocket
fuel
even
after
trying
it
many
times
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
delicious
on
a
cool
winters
night
strange
thing
here
i
have
always
really
liked
tremens
but
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
the
warmed
glass
of
ale
was
a
taste
similar
to
adult
cough
syrup
not
the
yummy
flavored
ones
that
you
would
sometimes
take
an
extra
swig
of
more
like
nyquil
or
the
ones
you
feel
the
need
to
do
a
chaser
after
dont
know
if
it
was
just
this
batch
or
this
nights
but
it
left
me
very
disappointed
served
in
a
goblet
poured
from
a
bottle
at
first
you
notice
this
beer
has
a
nice
color
that
one
could
compare
with
champagne
the
head
quickly
dissapates
after
pouring
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
light
accent
of
hops
the
smells
really
come
out
if
served
a
little
warmer
the
taste
was
something
very
special
as
it
hides
the
alcohol
content
well
flavors
are
very
complex
and
not
too
bitter
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
brew
i
have
ever
had
this
is
just
as
good
as
piraat
if
you
can
afford
to
pay
80
for
the
case
i
would
suggest
this
as
a
beer
that
is
worth
the
investment
finish
a
bottle
and
you
are
on
your
way
to
pure
relaxation
strong
ales
never
let
me
down
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
not
one
i
want
every
day
but
i
look
forward
to
have
it
on
special
occasions
shows
very
pale
and
almost
lager
looking
the
nose
is
horseblankets
and
hops
and
the
lager
look
is
destroyed
the
intial
taste
is
actually
subtle
and
smooth
this
much
like
duvel
though
with
less
complexity
i
fopund
it
to
be
very
drinkable
and
well
crafted
its
reputation
seems
to
be
big
and
rough
but
the
truth
is
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
with
little
roughness
cool
bottle
too
which
means
that
this
should
be
picked
up
if
available
it
served
well
as
a
way
start
forgetting
a
lame
work
week
and
finished
well
as
an
appetizer
and
early
desert
it
shouldnt
be
paired
with
spicy
tuna
rolls
notes
head
and
lacing
was
disapointing
label
sells
the
bottle
there
were
no
standout
characteristics
bottle
poured
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
with
minimum
retention
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
spice
in
the
traditional
belgian
style
taste
is
again
a
mix
of
malt
with
some
spices
quite
hard
to
figure
out
which
one
is
actually
included
which
drags
a
bit
too
long
at
the
end
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
is
always
appreciated
carbonation
is
standard
with
a
body
that
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
strong
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
ale
but
not
the
best
that
ive
tasted
this
is
a
fine
brew
and
one
that
i
would
come
back
to
if
i
had
the
chance
very
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
had
more
to
enjoy
the
alcohol
is
completely
absent
and
at
85
can
sneak
upoh
damn
beautifuly
decorated
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
i
give
this
4
5
for
appearance
due
to
the
fact
the
head
stayed
fluffy
through
the
whole
time
bubbly
carbonation
was
very
active
very
aromatic
you
can
almost
tell
what
its
going
to
taste
like
without
taking
a
sip
the
taste
is
nicely
complex
with
a
piney
citrusy
flavor
and
dry
peppery
and
herbal
finish
with
a
warmth
of
alcohol
from
the
few
of
this
style
i
have
tasted
this
one
represents
them
well
very
drinkable
though
at
this
abv
and
price
i
would
take
it
easy
as
this
one
is
satisfying
with
just
one
pours
typical
belgian
golden
straw
and
tall
fluffy
whit
ehead
smells
of
dusky
dank
barnyard
hay
and
overripe
fruit
taste
is
yeasty
breadlike
with
leather
wood
and
tobacco
flavors
the
finish
is
dry
mildly
citrus
hops
a
decent
brew
and
one
i
will
have
again
butnot
one
i
will
seek
out
i
sampled
this
brew
at
rfd
in
dc
the
beer
came
in
a
tulip
glass
which
was
nice
bright
gold
in
color
but
only
a
minimal
white
head
surface
layer
is
present
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
raspberry
and
cherry
coming
through
some
candied
sugar
and
bready
yeast
scents
the
first
sip
reveals
small
yet
prickly
carbonation
and
thicker
than
average
body
the
flavor
is
spicy
i
am
hit
with
nutmeg
and
cloves
right
away
and
also
hits
of
tart
fruit
like
granny
smith
apples
the
finish
is
a
little
peppery
and
slightly
drying
as
well
this
was
a
real
treat
on
tap
and
i
am
glad
to
finally
see
it
coming
into
ct
in
bottles
now
too
overall
impression
one
of
those
classic
eyecatching
belgian
ales
everyone
recognizes
the
painted
bottles
and
the
pink
elephants
this
is
one
of
the
first
few
belgian
beers
i
ever
tried
way
way
back
the
unique
presentation
and
mythical
elephant
is
definitely
more
impressive
than
the
beer
other
than
that
its
not
particularly
outstanding
had
2
years
later
on
tap
at
beer
bistro
and
it
would
get
the
same
rating
overcarbonated
good
level
of
yeast
and
some
fruitiness
including
aftertaste
i
see
that
this
beer
is
somewhat
highly
acclaimedby
other
bas
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
or
what
i
dont
know
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
buy
another
to
find
out
on
draught
at
the
lowlander
in
london
pours
a
pleasing
gold
color
with
a
medium
thin
eggshell
white
head
light
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
wheaty
lightbodied
and
effervescent
with
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
such
as
coriander
citrus
banana
and
yeast
the
alcohol
is
detectable
here
and
there
as
well
the
finish
is
sparkling
like
champagne
i
havent
had
the
bottled
version
of
this
yet
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
better
than
this
this
beer
poured
a
somewhat
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
head
dissapates
rather
slowly
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
heavy
on
the
yeast
with
some
fruity
undertones
lingering
underneath
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
whose
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
pale
malts
and
some
spiciness
and
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
the
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
taste
as
well
although
it
is
not
overwhelming
the
drinkability
is
above
average
as
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
do
not
see
myself
including
it
in
my
regular
rotation

of
the

taste

with

notes
finishes
a

dryer
but
still
some
sweetness
left
in
your
mouth
a
nice
crisp
ale
that
even
at
9
could
be
enjoyed
anytime
the
finish
is
strong
but
it
still
leads
one
to
the
next
sip
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
things
that
everyone
needs
to
try
at
least
once
overall
the
drinkability
suffered
because
there
were
just
too
many
flavors
and
it
was
a
bit
tart
maybe
after
a
few
years
i
will
give
it
a
try
but
a
beer
brewed
just
to
be
contrary
it
seems
thx
belgian
pales
are
one
of
my
favorites
style
this
ranks
high
for
me
this
was
just
an
excellent
belgian
ale
all
the
way
around
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
who
might
be
new

for

seems
like
a
nice
strong
belgian
ale
to
start
someone
out
with
pleasing
flavors
that
are
put
together
well
and
not
too
over
the
top
better
on
draught
that
in
the
bottle
overallit
looked
and
acted
like
a
classic
belgian
but
i
would
prefer
to
drink
a
chimay

a
unibroue

my

a
beer
i
can
handle
one
of
and
than
move
on
the

overall
doesnt
particularly
appeal
to
me
its
a
little
too
yeasty
and
musty
for
me
very
drinakble
a
sipper
after
taliking
to
the
feloniusmonk
i
decided
to
give
a
belgian
ale
another
try
i
really
want
to
like
them
advocates
but
you
know
i
give
up
i
know
this
to
be
a
well
thought
of
beer
but
still
i
dont
get
it
orangey
golden
color
was
topped
by
a
solid
white

was
attractive
in
the
forms
of
wispy

was
that
typical
spicy
clove
like
character
that
i
have
detected
in
all
the
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
taste
was
spicy
and
fruity
and
a
bit
smoother
than
others
still
i
dont
find
it
appealing
very
sprtitzy
mouthfeel
almost
champagne

very
alcoholic
and

great

its

if
your
getting
into
the
belgian
ales
and
pink
elephants
what
more
could
you
want
not
alot
of
repetitive
drinkability
here
gets
boring
ready
to
move
on
to
my
next
rare
belgian
bier
this
is
tart
acidic
and
very
dry
surprisingly
so
and
im
sorry
to
say
disappointingly
so
delerium
tremens
poured
a
cloudy
goldyellow
color
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
was
strong
and
yeasty
mostly
cloves
the
taste
was
bitter
and
very
sour
it
was
really
hoppy
and
citrusy
mostly
grapefruit
with
malt
way
in
the
background
as
it
warmed
the
malt
became
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
some
sweetness
started
coming
into
play
but
not
enough
for
me
the
finish
was
dry
and
citrusy
im
sure
there
was
a
lot
going
on
here
but
it
was
not
to
my
tastes
light
gold
color
with
big
frothy
almost
soapy
head
aroma
is
characteristic
of
a
belgian
golden
strong
green
apple
presence
in
the
taste
effervescent
body
that
warms
up
to
a
smooth
silkiness
in
the
mouth
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
not
disappointing
in
any
way
this
came
to
me
with
good
sized
2
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
several
minutes
and
dissipated
down
to
a
small
frothy
head
and
eventually
just
some
lacing
by
the
time
i
finished
it
was
a
nice
yellowy
gold
color
this
had
a
nice
light
smell
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
was
slightly
malty
with
some
bitter
flavors
that
i
cant
describe
there
was
a
little
fruit
flavor
as
well
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
ontap
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
beer
is
good
happy
beering
good
overall
i
marked
its
drinkability
lower
than
the
other
judging
points
primarily
because
the
flavor
was
good
but
not
too
exciting
and
again
the
olfactories
were
taken
for
a
spin
by
the
alcohol
also
i
would
have
preferred
the
bubblegum
flavor
to
play
second
fiddle
to
at
least
some
other
type
of
natural
sweetness
perhaps
a
nice
honey
to
match
the
beers
color
im
beginning
to
think
the
belgian
strong
dark
ales
are
more
suited
to
my
tastes
but
ill
give
the
pales
more
chances
in
the
future
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
plenty
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
id
rather
havethough
i
do
love
the
pink
elephants
theres
nothing
to
rave
about
but
neither
is
there
anything
to
actively
dislike
and
its
certainly
better
than
just
average
the
sparkling
personality
and
sweetsour
interplay
center
some
nice
peripheral
flavors
but
its
not
so
much
balanced
as
distinctly
segmented
it
seems
to
resist
a
real
integration
of
flavors
preventing
the
whole
from
outstripping
the
sum
of
the
parts
the
abv
ever
stepped
forward
but
its
there
and
that
along
with
the
noted
limitations
keep
the
overall
drinkablity
a
touch
above
average
its
not
that
im
disappointed
im
just
not
especially
impressed
the
taste
is
of
floral
overtones
with
a
rich
sweetness
the
hops
cut
off
at
the
back
end
and
leave
a
pleasant
dry
after
bite
real
nice
beer
i
had
this
with
some
olives
and
venison
bologna
and
it
was
a
bit
of
a
clash
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
alone
and
enjoyng
it
all
by
its
little
self
a
big
hearty
thanks
to
the
choralis
board
of
directors
for
this
particular
bottle
this
is
very
drinkable
the
8
5abv
could
really
wreak
some
havoc
on
the
unwary
beer
drinker
a
few
of
these
and
the
pink
elephants
they
see
might
not
all
be
on
the
label
another
belgian
in
the
tradition
of
chimay
blau
if
you
like
that
one
try
this
one
a
lot
of
clove
in
the
mix
unfortunately
not
my
favorite
spice
phenolic
that
about
says
it
a
spicy

and
banana
present

i
think
id
pass
on
a
repeat

compliments
of
the
clerk
at
half

who
threw
it
in
with
my
last
purchase
thanks
half

the
cork

a
date

2003
it
poured

light
and
finished
with
grapefruit
and
leather
not
as
complex
as
other
belgians
ive
had
but
a
nice
variety
of
flavors
wellexecuted
a
good
choice
to
send
me
over
the
top
into
the
mug
club
almost
one
year
since
i
joined
ba
outrageously
overpriced
and
overrated
no
big
deal
bought
a
big
botle
for
6
99
i
had
wanted
to
try
it
for
a
while
and
finally
got
around
to
buying

with
a
big
foamy

a
good
body
with
a
nice
crisp

the
alcohol

subdued
under
a
layer
of
malts
very
good
i
would
recommend
highly
started
out
new
years
eve
with
a
nice
bottle
of
this
at
harrys
bar
and
grill
in
milwaukee
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
did
not
want
to
review
it
without
a
recent
experience
i
loved
the
deep
golden
color
and
sweet
aroma
that
came
out
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
very
balanced
in
your
mouth
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
still
warms
the
body
as
it
goes
down
this
is
a
little
better
than
delirium

well
as

as
well
the

i
like
the

theres

with
so
many
belgians
clean
aftertaste
not
my
favorite
delirium
and
its
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
its
promising
appearance
still
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
around
ng
notes
liquor
store
two
blocks
from
my
house
has
a
very
very
good
selection
of
belgian
ales
and
this
is
just
one
of
many
i
really
like
this
one
but
nothing
jumps
out
an
says
i
am
better
than
the
rest
good
to
try
out
but
nothing
to
make
an
evening
of
or
buy
regularly
it
is
very
good
but
i
just
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
very
often
good
for
celebrations
im
not
sure
how
downinthecups
one
could
stay
with
a
glass
of
this
great
bottlereminds
me
of
the
simpsons
where
barney
calls
upon
his
pink
elephant
by
drinking
beer
to
counteract
the
demons
he
sees
after
drinking
the
peyote
infused
juice
drink
homer
makes
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
sweet
marshmallows
esters
citrusy
hops
and
yeast
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
kinda
wheaty
candy
with
a
good
hop
presence
bitter
finish
with
a
little
metallic
taste
warming
and
alcoholic
big
and
syrupy
but
manageable
another
good
one
from
huyghe
the
golden
body
is
joined
with
a
beautiful
head
and
decent
lace
effect
a
creamy
smooth
body
lifts
the
drinkability
of
this
big
beer
but
it
does
not
feel
weak
in
fullness
the
nose
is
heavily
fruited
and
has
an
incredible
malt
sense
when
warmed
flavorful
and
full
of
complexity
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
brew
a
fine
translucent
golden
color
highly
effervescent
and
a
full
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
bubblegum
and
some
hops
in
the
background
it
has
a
sweet
smooth
start
and
a
fine
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
effervescent
dts
is
a
wellbalanced
clean
combination
of
opposing
attributes
delicate
without
being
free
of
character
s
d
pale
yellow
with
a
white
lace
that
staws
there
to
the
end
of
the
glass
sweet
and
medicinal
nose
effervescent
leads
off
the
taste
followed
by
a
lovely
honey
toffeelike
sweetness
that
clears
to
a
warm
alcohol
burn
quite
potent
in
fact
im
not
typing
well
now
highly
recommended
beer
poured
a
yellowish
color
with
a
decent
head
the
nose
detected
some
yeastiness
in
the
aroma
the
sweet
malt
started
mellow
on
the
tongue
during
initial
swigs
but
seemed
to
grow
stronger
through
the
drink
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
offset
the
growing
sweetness
there
was
some
lacing
of
the
glass
the
alcohol
was
very
prevelent
in
this
so
one
is
more
than
enough
in
one
sitting
after
working
my
way
through
the
powerful
carbonation
i
get
a
lot
of
maltiness
alcohol
is
not
hidden
well
but
does
not
hurt
the
beer
too
much
a
little
bit
of
bready
yeasty
flavors
come
in
but
that
is
about
it
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
was
really
lost
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
medium
to
full
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
a
bit
boring
to
me
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
it
does
not
stand
up
to
others
in
its
class
drinkability

this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
absence
of
a
strong
malt
base
made
this
one
go
down
more
like
a
witbier
than
a
bspa
this
brew
came
bubbling
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
the
bottle
cap
was
pried
off
it
pours
with
a
large
bubbly
head
that
receds
to
about
a
half
inch
rocky
head
color
is
a
hazy
light
bronze
and
has
lots
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
aroma
from
this
one
although
some
malt
and
alcohol
are
noticeable
lots
of
carbonation
immediately
hits
the
tongue
giving
the
feeling
of
a
large
mouthfeel
theres
a
warming
sensation
all
the
way
down
creamy
sweet
malt
start
that
tastes
of
fruits
and
bubblegum
with
some
light
citrus
tastes
towards
the
end
some
yeast
is
noticeable
both
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
some
particles
floating
around
the
glass
the
finish
is
slightly
spicy
and
bitter
and
lingers
for
a
time
this
is
a
fairly
complex
brew
that
seems
to
improve
as
it
warms
a
bit
on
tap
poured
into
a
delirium
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
fruity
with
banana
and
white
grape
there
is
also
some
clove
spice
present
the
taste
is
fairly

the

it
goes
down
with
a

of
a
struggle
watch
out
for
those

pink
elephants
they
outnumber
you
and
will
very
easily
knock
you
on

youre

you

on
poured
from
the
white

oz

delirium
temens
is
the
fizziest
out
of
the
bottle
beer
i
have
seen
in
a

foam

is
highly
yeasty
surrounded
by
fruit
of
the

grapes
apples
and
bananas
the
white
foamy
head
dissipates
slowly
as
i
drink
the
tremens
surprising
spice
in
the
flavor
that
i
didnt
notice
in
the
aroma
clove
maybe
leaves
a
lingering
tang
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
also
taste
the
yeast
prominently
balances
well
with
the
other
esters
and
general
sweet
flavor
body
is
medium
at
most
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
search
for
id
be
interested
to
try
it
on
draft
though
i
think
it
could
lend
a
lot
more
to
the
beer
drinkability
just
a
bit
better
than
average
overall
not
too
bad
but
a
bit
off
due
to
the
illconcealed
alcohol
content
i
can
find
others
of
this
style
id
rather
have
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
similar
to
the
delirium
noel
but
with
not
as
much
spice
bartender
tapped
it
into
a
really
cool
delirium
tremens
goblet
that
had
the
pink
elephants
on
it
the
flavor
was
a
little
strong
at
first
but
i
got
used
to
it
after
a
few
drinks
maybe
the
alcohol
numbed
my
tastebuds
i
really
didnt
care
much
for
the
flavor
because
the
spicyness
was
too
strong
and
the
wheatyeast
flavor
was
too
prominent
it
has
a
nice
crisp
feel
to
it
but
because
of
the
wheatiness
of
the
brew
it
builds
in
the
mouth
an
unpleasant
overwhelming
mouthfeel
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
medium
good
beer
its
not
bad
but
id
definately
choose
a
number
of
other
brews
ahead
of
this
one
thats
why
ill
go
against
the
stream
and
will
not
give
it

superrating

the

yeasty

spicey
with
some
juicy

this

has
some
very
yeasty

it

taste
a
real
classic
my
next
mission
now
that
a
neighbor
several
reviews
ago
mentioned
that
it
was
on
tap
on
the
east
side
is
to
try
what
i
assume
will
be
the
river
of
eden
a
classic
light
gold
color
large
white
foamy
head
yeast
and
vanilla
in
the
aroma
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
of
apples
vanilla
coriander
clove
and
orange
not
much
of
a
hop
taste
alcohol
is
prevalent
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
a
little
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
interesting
but
kind
if
average
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
coating
fairly
heavy
and
believe
me
i
know
heavy
above
average
carbonation
makes
my
mouth
tingly
and
happy
usually
a
9er
such
as
this
limits
itself
for
drinkability
but
the
multilayered
flavors
make
it
hard
to
say
no
especially
out
here
in
the
savannah
after
eating
roots
and
shrubs
all
day
so
i
will
give
it
a
few
bonus
points
for
that
as
i
struggle
mightily
to
lift
my
heavy
frame
to
all
fours
and
once
again
seek
out
my
pack
to
rejoin
ultimately
social
creature
that
i
am
this
beer
was
served
a
pale
yellow
color
that
had
a
slight
haze
to
it
decent
head
that
was
white
in
color
with
good
density
and
while
it
lasted
it
created
a
nice
lace
approx
the
way
down
the
glass
then
as
the
foam
subsided
to
nothing
but
a
small
ring
the
lace
became
nonexistent
the
aromas
were
of
dried
fruits
pears
strawberry
tropical
spices
light
hops
some
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
and
alcohol
the
flavors
were
dominated
by
the
fruits
pineapple
some
spices
clove
pepper
hops
sweet
honey
malt
light
yeast
and
nice
warming
alcohol
finished
with
a
slight
dryness
mixed
with
alcohol
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
sweet
spicy
and
dry
came
to
mind
while
drinking
this
beer
all
the
flavors
seemed
to
be
very
nicely
balanced
each
aroma
and
flavor
seemed
to
compliment
one
another
well
a
must
try
overall
a
formidable
belgian
brew
well
worthy
of
its
marketable
name
this
beer
is
at
its
pinnacle
when
at
cellar
temparature
as
with
many
belgians
750
ml
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
massive
head
that
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
leaving
lots
of
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
almost
like
a
weizen
with
its
banana
like
aroma
taste
is
again
like
that
of
a
weizen
with
a
spiciness
that
leaves
behind
an
rather
odd
taste
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
but
i
find
that
i
really
dont
care
for
this
it
was
ok
but
id
pass
on
this
again
light
colored
body
with
a
phenolic
aroma
that
brings
out
some
spicyness
to
it
first
taste
is
of
a
malt
sweetness
that
i
can
only
accumulate
to
as
honey
more
nondescript
sweetness
comes
into
play
later
lots
of
spices
are
here
mainly
noticeable
is
pepper
from
the
phenols
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
and
gives
this
beer
an
added
dimension
the
finish
is
a
fruity
one
tasty
either
i
accomodated
or
the
flavor
got
a
little
less
intense
as
i
continued
to
pour
very
slight
phenol
quality
really
quite
smooth
especially
considering
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
nice
clean
finish
with
only
a
slight
dryness
that
remains
for
an
ale
it
actually
does
beer
cooler
that
warmer
i
certainly
dont
appreciate
this
like
others
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
all
the
subtlties
of
the
aroma
were
evident
in
the
flavor
id
give
it
a
highter
rating
maybe
its
a
freshness
issue
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
worthwhile
for
a
celebration
strong
delicious
ale
with
very
nice
belgian
lace
the
alcohol
is
present
throuhgout
this
very
serious
very
strong
ale
refreshing
and
delicious
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
coriander
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
the
world
and
always
worth
seeking
out
though
not
as
complex
as
the
bottle
version
mild
aroma
similar
to
a
hefe
weizen
i
recently
had
it
has
a
light
yellow
orange
color
with
a
short
head
that
disappears
quickly
it
tasted
a
little
sweetsour
to
me
not
a
bad
taste
but
i
also
think
my
taste
buds
were
a
little
off
from
a
recent
dinner
it
gave
me
a
bit
of
an
initial
tingly
feeling
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
that
lasted
a
fair
length
of
time
i
rate
it
highly
but
lowered
the
drinkability
as
to
suggest
its
high
alcohol
content
may
fool
you
when
drinking
oneafteranother
of
this
excelent
brew
pour
is
a
hazy
golden
peach
with
a
large
solid
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
fruity
apples
and
pears
slight
peppery
spice
in
the
back
flavor
is
sweet
lots
of
apple
some
mild
spiciness
comes
in
the
middle
to
the
end
mediumfull
bodied
dry
ending
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
would
have
to
be
the
bubbles
they
dont
stop
it
keeps
the
beer
refreshing
and
very
deceptive
regarding
its
alcohol
content
until
you
stand
up
i
will
certainly
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
on
my
next
trip
perhaps
im
getting
hard
to
please
as
i
start
to
develop
experience
with
different
beers
but
i
was
underwhelmed
nothing
exactly
wrong
here
just
not
a
lot
of
overly
right
hey
didnt
white
bottles
go
out
in
the
70s
along
with
white
shoes
on
runningbacks
anyhow
it
pours
a
goodlooking
gold
with
a
fat
white
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
fruit
with
a
slightly
medicinal
scent
and
noticeable
hops
the
taste
is
nice
but
the
alcohol
isnt
wellhidden
it
worked
better
when
paired
with
some
stilton
than
it
did
on
its
own
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
stack
up
all
that
well
in
the
universe
of
belgian
strong
ales
overall
an
excellent
brew
that
was
a
delight
to
drink
a
must
for
all
to
try
drinkability
this
brew
goes
down
quite
easily
for
being
8
5abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
they
snuck
up
on
me
and
had
me
seeing
pink
elephants
nice
crystal
clear
golden
color
aroma
was
sweet
and
alcoholic
very
strong
nice
thin
layer
of
head
throughout
lace
clung
to
the
glass
all
the
way
taste
was
sweet
then
became
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
maybe
cloves
mouthfeel
was
thick
rich
and
smooth
alcohol
taste
was
very
noticeable
a
delightful
belgian
delirium
tremens
with
the
pink
elephant
of
the
label
should
serve
as
a
valid
warning
as
to
this
brews
strength
the
color
is
sort
of
a
cloudy
butterscotch
with
orange
highlights
a
strong
alcohol
fume
rises
upon
opening
followed
by
hop
clove
and
sweet
malty
aromas
fully
malted
and
highly
hopped
this
ale
is
full
of
raw
and
wild
flavors
somewhat
herbal
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
lemon
peel
and
yeasty
flavors
round
this
unfiltered
strongly
alcoholic
ale
mouthfeel
is
remarkably
light
although
a
bit
oily
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
finest
and
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
come
across
a
perennial
favorite
of
mine
my
traditional
birthday
beer
to
share
with
friends
although
i
missed
out
this
year
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ales
great
eggshell
painted
bottle
with
little
pink
elephants
on
the
label
nice
pour
of
orange
tinted
cloudy
golden
body
and
white
froth
aroma
of
fruit
and
a
little
yeasty
first
few
sips
seemed
very
effervescent
bot
smoothed
out
as
it
rested
flavor
is
great
with
fruit
and
and
spices
with
a
definate
yeast
and
alcohol
presence
overall
sweet
and
dry
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
chimay
beers
ive
had
before
great
head
on
this
one
light
very
light
and
bright
white
reminicent
of
duvel
the
taste
was
not
what
i
exspected
sweeter
than
many
artisanal
pales
that
i
have
had
though
this
was
not
a
bad
thing
sour
finish
like
the
taste
of
a
grannysmiths
apple
the
alcohol
is
very
subtle
fot
the
stregnth
of
this
beer
which
is
8
5
not
9
as
listed
above
a
very
solid
beer
though
i
think
its
winning
the
world
beer
champoinships
is
a
little
bit
much
not
as
good
as
some
n
american
beers
ever
say
fin
du
monde
or
hennepin
still
a
great
one
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
an
abundant
head
that
remained
very
well
the
abundant
carbonation
helped
to
ensure
that
i
had
a
dose
of
head
with
each
taste
the
smell
was
dominantly
sweet
and
fruity
i
noticed
a
hint
of
a
raison
but
there
were
also
hints
of
spice
and
yeast
the
taste
was
both
sweet
and
sour
almost
like
a
green
apple
but
very
pleasant
and
fairly
complex
the
carbonation
and
medium
to
light
body
made
this
a
very
pleasant
beer
on
the
palate
this
beer
also
finished
surprisingly
crisp
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
but
i
think
if
i
had
the
choice
i
would
rather
have
a
hennepin
or
a
fin
du
monde
nevertheless
this
beer
is
in
elite
company
its
just
not
at
the
top
of
the
pile
in
my
book
granny
smith
apples
are
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
after
tasting
this
beer
ive
never
really
had
a
beer
that
tasted
like
this
before
surprisingly
sour
with
a
citric
twang
to
it
also
deceptively
strong
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
at
9bottle
but
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
and
medicinal
the
flavor
has
a
mild
sweetness
with
fruity
flavors
it
is
a
bit
astringent
with
a
drying
finish
it
is
medium
bodied
but
has
an
alcohol
content
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
a
very
delicious
easy
drinking
brew
pours
honeycolored
yellow
looks
thicker
than
it
is
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
in
flavor
its
missing
something
though
id
say
its
fair
to
say
this
is
reasonably
similar
to
duvel
in
some
respects
and
duvel
just
has
this
liveliness
and
spice
that
adds
something
this
one
is
a
bit
more
straightforward
with
that
fruit
candy
sweetness
characteristic
to
some
of
the
stronger
belgians
tasty
for
sure
but
could
be
a
wee
bit
better
orange
in
color
witha
thick
white
head
the
explosiveness
of
the
cabronation
is
evident
both
from
the
loud
pop
upon
releasing
the
cork
and
the
way
the
bubbles
simply
rocket
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
is
yeasty
with
plenty
of
spiciness
some
orange
zestiness
and
berrylike
fruitiness
flavor
is
maltier
than
id
expected
and
lightly
hopped
alcohol
flavor
is
mild
and
aftertaste
is
cherrylike
i
actually
found
it
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
until
i
added
the
yeast
this
gave
the
flavor
a
bit
more
zing
and
helped
to
balance
full
bodied
and
velvety
smooth
in
texture
a
very
decent
beer
one
of
the
belgianist
belgians
ive
tried
the
malt
was
almost
a
little
overpowering
for
my
taste
but
was
balanced
out
with
nice
lemon
and
coriander
flavors
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
head
was
huge
and
a
beautiful
color
and
consistency
and
even
though
i
though
i
poured
it
properly
it
still
ran
over
the
color
was
a
cloudy
pale
gold
with
only
a
faint
aroma
of
lemon
and
malt
alcohol
was
fairly
noticeable
which
leads
me
to
believe
the
content
may
be
a
bit
higher
than
9
0
i
also
noticed
that
the
flavors
became
more
subtle
and
pleasant
as
the
beer
warmed
slightly
and
was
exposed
to
the
air
all
in
all
a
nice
offering
but
guess
im
still
a
chimay
devotee
i
dont
think
i
could
have
picked
any
other
better
beer
for
my
100th
review
than
this
one
this
is
an
allaround
great
beer
it
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
its
topped
off
by
a
thick
and
fluffy
white
foam
that
fades
down
into
a
14inch
head
which
retains
itself
for
the
entire
duration
leaving
a
sticky
lace
splattered
on
the
side
of
the
glass
this
beer
is
bursting
with
a
huge
arsenal
of
aromas
bananas
coriander
malt
alcohol
and
grapefruit
are
very
prominent
intermixed
with
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
and
hops
that
are
blended
together
splendidly
to
give
this
beer
an
extremely
complex
nose
i
detected
a
different
scent
every
time
i
took
a
whiff
the
flavor
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
the
spiciness
of
coriander
and
the
tanginess
of
citrus
fruit
hit
the
taste
buds
first
followed
by
a
mild
sweetness
possibly
the
banana
and
then
finished
off
with
a
mellow
bitterness
of
hops
the
vast
array
of
flavors
masks
the
alcohol
taste
quite
well
the
high
carbonation
level
gives
this
brew
almost
champagnelike
qualities
which
tickles
my
tongue
this
is
an
extremely
balanced
and
complex
beer
theres
so
much
going
on
if
it
werent
for
the
high
cost

i
would
always
have
this
beer
on
hand
i
just
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
smells
of
fresh
lemon
and
orange
with
a
bit
of
floral
hop
notes
very
strong
on
the
nose
quite
citrusy
taste
is
a
smooth
lemony
delight
with
a
little
sweet
bitter
malt
at
the
start
and
jumps
right
into
the
lemon
and
orange
peels
and
mixed
with
a
fresh
floral
hop
and
spice
very
good
feel
some
dryness
to
it
but
its
very
citrusy
wet
and
smooth
drinkable
yes
sir
indeed
a
beer
that
will
bring
a
smile
to
your
face
the
nose
is
belgian
spiciness
strong
citrus
and
very
sweet
the
front
is
sweet
spicy
schpritzy
the
middle
is
sweet
apples
with
some
alcohol
the
finish
is
dry
and
fresh
with
spice
and
alcohol
its
just
a
little
too
trendy
alcoholic
beverage
for
my
tastes
i
found
the
sweetness
more
obvious
than
in
the
nocturnum
and
the
alcohol
not
as
well
hidden
the
effect
seems
even
worse
as
the
beer
warms
but
im
nitpicking
its
a
good
beer
this
ale
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
thin
wispy
white
foam
the
smell
was
malty
with
some
hops
and
a
hint
of
fruit
and
sweetness
the
taste
was
on
the
sweet
side
malt
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
some
fruit
apples
and
musty
grapes
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
smooth
and
creamy
the
carbonation
was
medium
there
was
a
good
finish
the
drinkability
was
good
this
ale
went
down
easy
many
say
this
is
not
an
outstanding
brew
and
i
believe
thats
because
its
not
a
knockout
experience
on
all
levels
important
to
remember
that
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
quiet
and
not
with
big
flavors
it
isnt
a
sweet
and
spicy
dubbel
or
a
high
and
complex
trippel
dt
should
be
judged
as
such
for
subtlety
or
appropriateness
as
these
are
the
standards
for
a
strong
golden
ale
these
beers
are
meant
to
be
drunk
like
we
do
pilseners
in
the
states
i
love
the
presentation
of
the
big
white
ceramic
looking
750ml
bottles
the
blue
foil
tops
and
the
pink
elephants
and
dancing
alligators
pours
a
beautiful
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
tremendous
rocky
and
foamy
white
head
that
billows
out
of
the
glass
and
lasts
almost
forever
and
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
slowly
dissipates
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
notes
of
fresh
citrus
sweet
malts
and
pepper
very
nice
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
fine
carbonation
taste
is
lightly
fruity
with
notes
of
citrus
sweet
honey
and
spicy
hops
finish
is
crisp
and
lightly
sweet
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
simply
delicious
a
cloudy
golden
brew
a
little
darker
than
pure
golden
but
still
within
range
of
it
i
hope
i
didnt
get
too
much
yeast
in
the
pour
it
was
hard
to
judge
since
the
bottle
is
opaque
on
to
the
aroma
spicy
pepper
a
bit
tart
and
a
bit
sweet
very
yeasty
as
well
which
i
find
quite
pleasant
actually
the
flavor
comes
in
as
a
wave
of
pepper
spiciness
with
a
big
backbone
of
yeastcoated
hops
malt
shows
up
as
part
of
this
as
well
in
a
slight
bready
character
as
it
swirls
in
your
mouth
the
pepper
character
and
slight
alcohol
presence
really
make
your
tongue
tingle
but
the
aforementioned
backbone
is
still
huge
turns
sweeter
in
the
back
and
in
the
finish
other
spiciness
is
present
here
and
there
a
very
tasty
tripel
highly
recommended

another

taste
overall
average
this
was
somthing
i
came
across
at
bjs
brewery
and
with
all
the
good
reviews
i
read
and
heard
i
just
had
to
go
for
the
trip
this
one
has
a
light
golden
color
and
foamy
head
smiliar
to
duvel
i
had
to
let
it
rest
for
a
couple
of
seconds
fo
it
to
settle
a
bit
the
taste
is
to
my
buds
a
really
good
refreshing
beer
resembled
some
fruitful
notes
and
and
a
hint
of
sweet
spice
that
combined
for
me
quite
well
at
one
point
i
did
let
it
settle
too
long
and
it
got
warm
one
of
my
friends
tried
it
out
of
curiousity
and
told
me
thats
a
good
wine
cooler
hmm
well
all
the
flavor
combination
did
a
good
job
for
masking
the
abv
as
thelongbeachbum
would
say
good
stuff
despite
the
9
abv
rushing
to
the
fore
its
incredibly
consumable
and
urges
another
swallow
after
the
last
an
ale
though
very
pilsnerlike
but
every
bit
belgian
candy
sugar
is
involved
and
copious
hops
and
plenty
of
flavor
it
took
me
a
year
to
get
this
after
i
first
saw
it
chosen
as
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
by
one
author
i
have
since
had
many
belgian
and
belgian
styled
beers
and
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
all
of
the
beers
ive
tried
this
one
would
probably
be
the
most
dangerous
but
a
little
thin
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
overall
a
good

it

soon
dissappeared
into
thin
lacy
lines
on

glass
and
a
scum
almost
the
spiciness
was
there
but
not
the
hoppy
character
i
think
i
remember
a
strange
nondescript
mouthfeel

something
about
the
beer
seemed
a

off

o
im
still
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
no
means
my
favorite
but
quite
drinkable
and
quite
interesting
o
this
beer
didnt
seem
to
be
as
complex
as
other
beers
in
the
style
but
hid
its
alcohol
rather
well
and
therefore
was
quite
drinkable
a
tasty
belgian
blonde
lost
somewhere
between
a
classic
tripel
and
a
belgian
pale
or
strong
golden
its
hazy
and
pale
yellow
with
a
few
yeast
bits
and
a
nose
of
cut
grass
and
fruity
yeast
coming
off
of
a
several
inch
tall
white
head
that
rings
every
sip
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
floral
hops
on
the
front
end
and
a
pretty
sweet
and
sturdy
malt
base
for
its
color
but
it
flavored
predominantly
by
a
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
thats
got
hints
of
pears
and
apples
to
it
without
being
cloying
or
artificial
a
decent
bit
of
residual
sugar
in
the
finish
gives
body
by
arrests
drinkability
significantly
and
even
effervescent
carbonation
cant
cut
it
or
lighten
it
up
much
a
hearty
brew
for
its
looks
and
one
that
while
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
lot
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
just
a
bit
filling
and
sweet
for
all
day
drinking
but
its
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
quality
is
at
the
forefront
of
the
experience
less
sweet
than
a
lot
of
these
strong
belgians
the
classic
blonde
flavor
with
a
restrained
yet
sharp
alcoholic
note
on
tap
at
fathom
in
san
diego
massive
carbonation
with
a
huge
head
of
foam
about
an
inch
thick
golden
colored
with
a
bit
of
haziness

of
green
apples
and
belgian

sugar
i
also
get
a
bit
of
a
belgian

the

mouthfeel
is
a

carbonated

dry

is
ok

is

i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
for
a
belgian
strong
i
love
the
sweetness
start
with
the
bittersour
finish
easy
to
drink
and
not
overpowering
poured
a
clearish
orange
although
there
are
definitely
some
murky
yeast
or
carbonation
bubbles
kicking
around
and
the
head
and
lace
retention
are
great
citric
and
some
sweet
fruit
and
definite
yeast
and
spicy
nose
as
it
is
a
particularly
strong
beer
crisp
light
bodied
passes
easy
great
balance
between
a
crisp
edge
thanks
to
spice
and
carbonation
and
a
smoothness
from
yeast
as
well
as
some
sweet
fruit
flavors
like
mango
or
pineapple
as
well
as
crisp
citric
orange
alcohol
started
to
warm
the
finish
and
hit
me
as
i
drank
but
overall
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
ale
overall
a
good
solid
strong
pale
ale
oi
had
a
difficult
time
getting
into
this
beer
the
flavors
did
not
integrate
very
well
with
oneanother
it
is
as
if
they
took
tremens
which
i
enjoy
and
injected
an
unnecessary
hop
note
that
just
doesnt
fit
very
well
while
i
did
not
hate
this
beer
there
are
other
belgian
bitters
that
i
would
go
to
first
o
a
well
made
vibrant
and
very
drinkable
beer
taste
is
both
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
lovely
complexity
more
mandarins
and
citrus
and
hops
bundled
together
nicely
carbonated
in
the
mouth
c
this
is
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
its
a
classic
tripel
sweet
and
fullbodied
the
alcohol
is
well
covered
up
here
more

medium

overall
it
fails
to
reach
the
dizzy
heights
of
delirium
tremens
chimay
or
duvel
but
is
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
should
serve
to
be
a
great
winter
warmer
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
if
it
werent
for
the
ghastly
price
of
11
a
bottle
well
priced
and
i
really
like
the
simple
label
and
cap
id
call
it
a
triple
not
a
bspa
but
it
could
swing
either
way
not
my
most
favourite
style
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
wellmade
sugar
grain
fruit
and
restrained
booze
fury
edging
into
tripel
territory
this
is
kind
of
a
bit
offputting
to
actually
drink
maybe
its
my
unfair
seasonal
expectations
maybe
not

into

with

the
flavor
matched

was
a

texture
was

this
beer
on

in

thoughts
at

time

to
buy
a
couple
bottles
when
i
saw
it
at
a
shop
after
tasting
it
again
i
definitely
can
place
it
as
a
very
good
beer
overall
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
i
will
try
another
one
in
the
future
overall
good
beer
not
their
best
wouldnt
pass
one
down
if
offered
will
review
again
so
peter
this
a
beer
which
is
very
very
good
when
you
see
it
try
it
o
the
only
other
bspa
that
gives
la
guillotine
a
run
for
the
money
is
don
de
dieu
which
has
a
completely
different
character
most
similar
to
duvel
la
guillotine
pleases
me
far
more
even
if
it
cannot
serve
as
such
a
widelyregarded
stylistic
benchmark
the
alcohol
is
vaguely
noticeable
but
completely
unconcerning
i
could
and
would
drink
a
pint
or
more
of
this
beer
highly
recommended
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacking
in
body
for
me
as
well
as
the
alcohol
content
being
too
obvious
d
i
was
kind
of
underwhelmed
here
the
taste
is
very
average
and
nothing
really
stands
out
la
guillotine
is
nothing
short
of
delicate
and
is
clearly
a
finely
crafted
beer
to
reach
this
sort
of
balance
whilst
maintaining
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
is
something
special
to
behold
an
impressively
crafted
beer
just
not
quite
as
good
as
some
others
from
this
brewery
particularly
delerium
tremens
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
treat
to
be
savoured
on
occasion
this
beer
is
a
good
one
from
huyghe
ive
had
some
of
theirs
in
the
past
this
beer
is
maybe
only
very
little
different
from
the
others
again
an
intriguing
beer
from
this
brewer
probably
not
as
desirable
as
stablemate
delirium
tremens
but
still
worth
a
look
a
solid
drink
but
with
such
an
odd
taste
its
probably
not
to
everyones
liking
mouthfeel
is
coarse
not
exactly
rough
maybe
i
should
call
it
airy
good
beer
not
stellar
wouldnt
session
it
pours
fizzy
golden
straw
slightly
clouded
beer
with
fluffy
resistant
head
sweet
nose
of
yeasts
hop
citrus
coriander
not
very
sweet
taste
with
excessive
yeasts
alcohol
moderate
carbonation
nothing
to
add
ive
perused
previous
reviews
and
thought
whether
liquid
in
my
glass
was
the
same
as
beer
of
reviewers
this
one
dont
stun
but
disappoint
me
d
high
despite
the
high
abv
you
cannot
feel
too
much
the
alcohol
really
easy
to
lose
the
head
here
a
few
sips
per
minute
allows
appreciation
of
a
very
good
beer
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
beware
of
the
9
abv
or
you
might
just
lose
your
head
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
little
too
strong
in
the
alcohol
characteristics
to
be
very
drinkable
however
if
this
is
brewed
with
only
the
four
main
ingredients
as
labeled
on
the
bottle
id
be
very
impressed
with
no
sugars
added
notes
i
was
attracted
to
this
beer
since
the
bottle
looks
much
like
another
beer
brewed
by
this
brewery
delerium
tremens
and
i
am
glad
that
i
followed
through
on
getting
it
while
it
does
not
reach
the
level
of
delerium
tremens
it
is
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
i
like
this
style
of
beer
its
sour
cloudy
full
of
yeastand
spice
and
many
things
niceim
still
looking
for
the
perfect
beer
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
up
there
on
the
list
i
really
enjoy
this
and
im
dying
to
try
another
one
with
a
more
developed
palate
to
figure
this
out
on
the
other
hand
id
rather
have
a
delerium
tremens
bought
at
drinx
vanuxumdef
spelt
wrong
in
belgium
poured
into
its
own
tulip
glass
with
a
large
white
head
smells
very
sweet
and
earthyhoppy
drank
while
eating
some
clam
chowder
the
pepper
in
the
chowder
deffinantly
accentuates
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
i
dont
think
that
it
would
have
been
quite
as
good
with
out
the
clam
chowder
which
was
pretty
spicy
recommend
drinking
it
with
a
spicy
dish
with
the
low
carbination
it
wont
make
the
dish
feel
hotter
it
actually
cools
it
down
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
pale
ale
conclusion
im
somewhat
torn
on
this
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
if
slightly
simple
and
the
alchol
is
a
bit
hot
but
its
also
nicely
sharp
and
palatecleansing
overall
a
pretty
nice
belgian
strong
pale
pretty
good
finish
is
exceptionally
dry
the
acid
in
the
smell
is
a
little
odd
worth
trying
once
but
id
stick
with
their
delirium
tremens
which
is
far
superior
if
youre
at
the
brauhaus
in
brussels
go
to
the
end
of
the
deadend
alley
and
see
the
littleappreciated
and
frequently
overlooked
jeanneke
pis
the
squatting
little
sister
of
famous
manneken
pis
r
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
huyghe
yet
this
one
is
worth
buying
at
least
3
of
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
one
that
is
smooth
with
age
i
imagine
theres
some
fresher
characters
in
the
younger
version
that
i
may
have
missed
but
the
mellow
creamy
languous
version
i
have
here
is
just
fine
with
me
d
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
plenty
of
taste
carbonation
to
keep
you
interested
prefer
delirium
over
this
but
not
by
too
much
this
would
go
great
with
a
light
and
flaky
halibut
or
some
angel
food
cake
as
a
dessert
very
fun
and
interesting
belgian
to
sip
on
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
finish
off
the
season
the
taste
however
is
a
little
better
well
balanced
with
a
bold
sweet
and
spicy
taste
up
front
but
a
pleasantly
bitter
kick
at
the
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
9
abv
nothing
bad
to
say
about
the
taste
if
anything
i
would
say
la
guillotine
falls
short
of
the
90
mark
for
lack
of
originality
it
just
doesnt
seem
that
memorable
id
get
it
again
but
at
470
yen
4
50
its
kind
of
expensive
along
with
the
other
brouwerij
huyghe
offerings
ive
had
recommended
almost
tart
in
mouthfeel
quite
dry
in
profile
alcohol
heat
is
evident
its
definately
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
although
almost
too
similar
to
its
brother
delirium
tremens
regardless
i
remain
very
happy
with
it
something
ill
buy
again
saw
this
along
with
the
small
selection
of
nonmacro
singles
at
a
local
beer
store
pured
a
hazy
amberyellow
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
as
much
fizz
a
gingerale
frothy
white
head
that
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
very
much
a
breadish
smell
with
a
hint
of
that
high
abv
tasted
quite
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
hops
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
in
the
mouth
afterward
tried
this
one
on
an
empty
stomach
got
quite
the
headrush
taste
has
smoothed
out
nicely
lots
of
carbonation
keep
it
crisp
and
light
yeasty
flavor
with
spice
and
pepper
a
bit
fruity
but
not
sweet
quite
dry
finish
slightly
alcohol
aftertaste
but
still
well
hidden
complex
and
still
a
bit
strong
in
the
flavor
department
but
has
mellowed
out
nicely
i
have
to
concur
with
others
that
its
curious
huyghe
would
brew
another
beer
so
similar
to
delirium
tremens
this
ones
different
enough
however
that
i
can
state
a
clear
preference
for
its
superior
sibling
not
really
sure
why
huyghe
makes
2
different
beers
which
are
so
similar
maybe
someday
ill
try
them
sidebyside
and
compare
for
what
difference
must
exist
overall
the
very
light
golden
ale
was
pleasant
to
drink
but
seemed
to
be
one
dimensional
poured
out
nicely
with
a
good
head
that
fell
quick
with
very
little
lace
but
that
might
have
been
because
it
was
a
little
too
cold
strong
fruity
esters
like
apple
cider
and
yeasty
all
over
the
placeeven
pouring
gently
and
leaving
an
inch
and
tasted
very
sweet
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
solid
carbonation
bite
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
back
but
nothing
much
and
no
hop
presence
at
all
i
was
hoping
that
it
would
warm
up
well
but
seemed
to
get
thinner
and
the
9
alcohol
really
expanded
and
filled
my
mouth
it
comes
in
a
sharp
bottle
with
a
guillotine
on
the
front
so
i
had
hope
for
a
bit
more
good
if
its
in
front
of
you
and
you
like
huyghe
i
couldnt
read
the
best
used
by
date
on
the
bottle
and
got
it
in
jasper
albertaso
maybe
it
was
past
its
prime
another
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
discovered
during
my
stay
in
a
foreign
land
pours
a
cloudy
golden
tinge
with
a
small
but
impressive
looking
white
head
loads
and
loads
of
sediment
were
swirling
around
this
beer
as
well
as
a
few
other
darker
sediment
particles
that
did
not
look
attractive
but
didnt
seem
to
bug
me
smell
was
excellent
fruit
throughout
such
as
cherries
apples
passionfruit
pineapple
there
was
also
a
light
medicinal
smell
in
there
taste
was
amazing
juicy
fruit
and
sweet
sugary
honey
dominated
with
some
mild
sour
trangs
coming
through
as
it
went
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
it
was
somewhat
syrupy
maybe
due
to
the
honey
tastes
i
noticed
as
for
drinkability
my
god
if
only
i
had
this
beer
around
every
night
i
would
be
in
sheer
bliss
i
swear
this
beer
came
straight
from
hades
to
tempt
us
all
with
its
deliciousness
indulge
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
highly
carbonated
for
me
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
fantastically
enjoyable
though
i
dig
belgian
strongs
both
pale
and
dark
this
one
is
worth
a
try
complex
but
still
a
bit
unbalanced
a
promising
beer
and
drinkable
but
ultimately
disappointing
especially
given
the
usually
fine
beers
produced
by
this
brewery
a
fairly
standard
belgian
pale
could
be
better
could
be
alot
worse
notes
i
wish
this
beer
had
some
sort
of
head
retention
or
lacing
but
at
9
i
can
understand
why
it
doesnt
this
beer
has
mellowed
out
into
a
smooth
and
fruity
belgian
beer
the
alcohol
is
still
quite
strong
after
spending
so
much
time
in
the
bottle
and
the
heavy
carbonation
makes
this
a
slow
sipping
beer
its
still
very
good
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
well
drinkable
these
kinds
of
strong
belgian
ales
arent
usually
too
good
to
have
dozens
of
but
this
one
is
nice
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
in
rapid
succession
still
if
i
wanted
to
get
that
smashed
i
might
as
well
drink
a
couple
then
switch
to
some
cheap
local
macro
brew
im
enjoying
this
one
now
though
and
this
will
become
a
regular
i
think
i
find
this
beer
to
be
all
over
the
place
there
are
mouthfulls
that
i
find
fantastic
and
mouthfulls
that
put
me
off
a
bit
its
certainly
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
or
perhaps
couldnt
at
this
strength
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
sitting
but
i
certainly
will
have
it
again
upfront
the
taste
is
even
more
fruity
peaches
and
pears
with
an
odd
grainy
texture
that
i
didnt
quite
like
this
is
followed
by
a
long
peppery
phenolic
aftertaste
thats
quite
spicy
and
a
bit
overpowering
not
quite
as
balanced
or
tasty
as
id
like
this
beer
makes
me
think
that
huyghe
can
actually
brew
but
oddly
enough
it
is
very
similar
to
the
tremens
mammoth
head
near
brilliant
white
and
very
finebubbled
milklike
the
lacing
moves
quickly
but
it
does
stick
cloudy
peachy
yellow
in
some
light
light
brown
in
others
the
appearance
is
everything
a
belgian
strong
ale
should
be
the
aroma
is
super
sweet
strongly
fruitfilled
and
syrupy
apricot
peach
and
tart
candy
mmm
the
strongly
sweet
aroma
gets
high
praise
from
sweetbeer
lovers
there
is
a
creamy
quality
about
the
aroma
as
well
and
the
yeasty
freshness
is
superbly
appetising
the
taste
is
very
much
like
wine
or
sherry
along
with
some
ultrasweet
fruit
brandies
i
have
tasted
the
phenolic
taste
is
not
overwhelming
though
very
tangible
otherwise
there
are
sweet
malt
apricot
and
berries
of
various
sorts
mint
and
earthy
yeast
tastes
leaving
a
dry
puckering
mouth
sensation
the
finish
though
is
extremely
alcoholic
leaving
the
tongue
with
a
warming
burning
feel
which
is
the
only
reason
this
is
not
an
easily
drinkable
beer
high
carbonation
and
fullbodied
no
this
is
enjoyable
only
perhaps
occasionally
and
certainly
no
more
than
two
in
the
same
session
high
carbonation
and
fullbodied
this
is
more
akin
to
a
fruit
brandy
or
port
phenomenal
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
best
part
of
the
brew
for
me
carbonation
is
light
but
sharp
especially
felt
on
the
tongue
as
soon
as
the
cream
from
the
head
passes
very
good
drinkability
9
is
imperceptible
except
for
the
warming
of
the
stomach
reminds
me
a
lot
of
delirium
tremens
the
most
famous
beer
from
this
brewer
which
makes
you
wonder
why
eh
but
why
wonder
why
wonder
a
good
bottle
of
suds
i
sez
slightly
above
average
beer
but
below
average
belgian
came
in
a
green
330
ml
bottle
coated
with
grey
enamel
red
foil
around
neck
and
cap
best
before
date
marked
on
back
label
appearance
is
a
hazy
golden
apricot
hue
foamy
white
head
that
eventually
recedes
to
a
thin
cap
spicy
nose
peppery
clove
and
banana
sweetish
fruit
like
peach
or
apricot
some
boozy
pear
sweet
malt
flavour
is
peachy
and
peppery
boozy
malt
finish
but
that
taste
of
fruit
comes
back
to
linger
on
the
aftertaste
big
boozy
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
probably
one
of
the
best
specimens
ive
had
from
this
family
brewery
so
far
it
has
a
well
rounded
character
and
a
very
memorable
one
at
that
poured
with
a
white
head
that
stays
leaving
no
lace
low
carbonation
light
golden
color
nose
is
alcohol
and
apple
starts
with
an
alcohol
flavor
and
finishes
the
same
but
smooth
some
sweet
overtones
but
the
alcohol
overwhelms
the
malts
and
hops
the
330ml
bottle
was
found
in
york
england
for
2
25
its
a
mighty
brew
perhaps
a
bit
much
for
me
still
thats
not
the
beers
fault
is
it
f
not
too
good
quite
spicy
and
fizzy
but
i
really
didnt
like
the
detergenty
taste
that
it
left
in
your
mouth
it
could
be
quite
good
but
its
just
a
bit
fizzy
and
soapy
for
me
notes
spicy
and
quite
flamboyant
that
is
just
what
i
want
in
my
belgian
pale
strong
ale
perhaps
a
little
over
the
top
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
complex
and
flailing
with
wild
flavours
o
my
biggest
complaint
way
too
much
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
the
tart
funk
bitterness
is
a
regular
flavor
in
this
style
but
it
seems
to
not
be
no
bottle
date
so
it
may
be
old
i
would
love
to
know
the
bottle
date
or
try
one
fresh
it
starts
well
but
doesnt
finish
well
the
taste
has
a
dry
bite
to
it
along
with
the
toasted
and
juicy
fruit
characters
already
mentioned
im
glad
i
revisited
this
beer
havent
had
in
a
couple
years
really
great
all
around
but
only
7
99
bevmo
i
had
to
grab
with
a
fresh
carnevale
last
month
at
monks
just
not
for
me
straight
up
strong
pale
ale
a
really
great
belgianstyled
beer
from
lost
abbey
a
drier
hoppier
alternative
to
the
original
ones
without
ignoring
the
rich
yeasts
overall
i
liked
this
beer
not
in
your
face
just
pleasent
and
refreshing
worst
thing
about
this
ale
over
carbonated
its
aight
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
poured
very
light
almost
looked
like
a
witbeer
but
the
taste
was
great
paired
with
spiced
chorizo
sausage
and
cheese
and
spicy
gouda
cheese
and
was
great
brought
out
the
flavor
in
this
beer
perfect
pairing
o
definitely
one
of
my
new
top
5
bspas
has
all
the
components
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
champagnelike
carbonation
is
dry
yet
still
somewhat
sweet
and
has
a
yeast
presence
thats
almost
perfectly
balanced
toward
the
malt
flavor
the
body
is
very
creamy
with
a
fine
soft
effervescence
25
4
oz
bomber
finally
i
get
to
review
a
lost
abbey
product
i
have
heard
so
much
about
inferno
ale
at
9
0
surely
gets
the
job
done
but
the
taste
is
not
quite
there
a
little
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
burn
when
you
drink
it
maybe
better
suited
as
a
winter
beer
watch
out
for
the
heartburn
ok
beer
but
at
10
99
a
bottle
you
want
more
than
ok
probably
would
not
get
this
beer
again
not
even
black
sabbath
could
make
this
and
excellent
beer
motley
out
good
beer
with
good
complexity
but
not
mind
blowing
partially
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
generally
have
high
expectations
on
lost
abbeys
brews
o
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
is
not
outstanding
for
the
style
the
taste
and
smell
are
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
it
drinks
easily
though
a
solid
tripel
good
flavour
even
if
there
isnt
a
twist
carbonation
a
little
lacking
its
not
all
that
easy
to
drink
it
smells
so
good
but
then
its
just
painful
to
finish
i
have
a
whole
bomber
to
get
through
and
i
have
no
idea
how
this
misses
the
mark
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
to
date
need
to
find
some
more
of
this
one
soon
pours
hazy
yellow
orange
lot
of
musty
grain
and
alcohol
on
nose
flavor
explosively
earthy
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
i
right
now
prefer
it
to
russian
river
damnation
still
the
duvel
is
king
of
strong
pales
and
will
always
be
but
yea
these
american
brewers
know
how
to
get
it
close
o
complex
and
bold
in
aroma
and
flavor
inferno
ale
packs
a
wallop
of
alcohol
that
goes
generally
unnoticed
through
its
consumption
a
trait
sought
after
in
this
highly
drinkable
style
an
incredible
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
start
to
finish
the
lost
abbeys
inferno
ale
get
as
close
to
replicating
the
classics
as
possible
so
close
in
fact
one
might
believe
it
straight
from
belgium
in
a
blind
tasting
to
top
it
off
every
time
ive
experienced
this
beer
it
retains
its
quality
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
one
of
the
largest
producers
of
this
style
the
lost
abbeys
inferno
ale
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
absolutely
must
be
tried
by
any
selfrespecting
beer
lover
d
drinks
pretty
good
after
3
years
a
tasty
belgian
strong
blond
with
some
very
interesting
barnyard
funky
notes
really
found
this
enjoyable
and
wonder
if
it
is
equally
as
barnlike
fresh
the
lost
abbey
inferno
ale
45
o
the
lost
abbey
has
yet
to
release
a
beer
that
i
dont
like
and
i
love
how
epically
metal
their
labels
are
first
i
prefer
ipas
the
bitterer
the
betterer
given
that
i
got
this
as
a
gift
and
had
to
try
it
the
color
was
a
nice
golden
the
head
was
one
finger
floating
above
four
in
a
snifter
slowing
melting
to
a
nice
coat
on
the
top
ale
was
about
3638
degrees
f
i
like
my
ipas
cold
smell
was
mild
fruity
typical
of
a
belgian
with
no
individual
overwhelming
flavor
taste
was
nice
extremely
complex
sweet
aftertaste
but
enough
bitterness
not
to
be
cloying
spices
well
mixed
several
different
fruity
hints
overlapped
each
other
mouth
feel
was
great
smooth
thick
almost
left
nice
coating
alcohol
was
nicely
hidden
by
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
nice
buzz
after
a
while
i
just
might
try
some
more
of
these
unique
belgians
from
now
on
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on
1242012
no
carbonation
pop
upon
opening
pours
moderately
hazy
bright
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
cap
for
a
head
that
reduces
to
a
ring
minimal
clinging
bubbles
on
the
glass
aromas
of
lemon
pear
apple
grape
banana
clove
pepper
honey
wheat
candi

herbal
and
yeast
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and

on
the

for
a

of

and

sweetness
with
a
great
maltspiciness
balance
and
no
cloying

after
the
finish
zero
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
moderately
slick
and
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
decent
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
despite
having
nearly
zero
carbonation
this
was
a
very
good
belgian
strong
golden
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
fruityspicy
yeast
and
malt
flavors
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
i
found
this
one
enjoyable
and
i
would
recommend
checking
this
one
out
taste
is
very
floral
very
belgianlike
nice
for
9
but
very
rich
ive
kind
of
burned
out
on
the
rich
brews
and
the
belgians
but
this
is
still
very
well
crafted
it
was
my
fault
for
going
on
an
allout
belgianfest
and
getting
tired
of
these
beautiful
rich
brews
not
sure
why
i
even
picked
this
one
up
but
here
i
am
here
it
is
and
i
havent
officially
logged
a
review
on
this
one
yet
although
ive
had
it
many
times
i
still
love
this
one
and
appreciate
the
what
theyve
done
on
this
one
o
good
stuff
nice
mix
of
spice
yeast
and
sweet
malt
and
citrus
flavors
all
harmonized
well
a
real
easy
drinker
be
careful
though
the
9
is
completely
hidden
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
and
manages
to
hide
its
alcohol
very
well
its
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
bottle
hazy
golden
almost
pale
colour
with
a
good
head
with
a
two
figers
head
that
goes
quicly
big
bubbles
smell
of
tropical
fruits
spices
bananas
it
feels
really
good
in
the
palate
soft
but
pungent
mild
with
a
note
of
sweet
and
wild
fruits
and
spices
taste
of
tropical
fruits
banana
spices
kind
of
hot
spices
semisweet
and
dry
finish
a
lot
of
things
that
seem
to
change
from
aone
moment
to
another
brilliant
another
welldone
lost
abbey
brew
im
sure
a
year
and
half
in
the
bottle
did
this
some
favors
so
your
mileage
may
vary
with
a
young
bottle
o
a
good
expression
of
a
belgian
strong
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
refreshing
and
delicious
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
chunky
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spices
and
some
peppery
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
yeast
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
highly
enjoyable
belgian
strong
pale
easy
to
find
here
in
sd
too
and
a
good
price
hmmm
could
be
the
condition
of
this
bottle
but
this
is
far
from
lost
abbeys
finest
comes
across
blunt
and
amateurish
overall
very
tasty
could
be
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
if
i
didnt
have
so
many
others
to
try
first
this
january
2013
i
review
a
bottle
of
inferno
bottled
october
2011
this
pours
with
the
same
thick
head
but
it
dissipates
faster
and
sticks
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
above
the
beer
there
are
no
bubbles
rising
in
the
orange
liquid
the
smell
actually
reminds
me
of
wine
lots
of
fruit
but
a
lot
more
alcohol
in
the
smell
than
what
i
recall
a
young
inferno
to
have
i
raised
smell
up
to
5
after
it
warmed
and
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
went
down
bring
more
of
the
raisin
and
pear
and
peach
like
smells
out
before
the
taste
i
will
describe
te
mouthfeel
as
it
is
unique
for
how
little
bubble
action
we
see
as
soon
as
its
in
my
mouth
it
starts
to
lightly
bubble
and
fizz
as
if
it
was
just
waiting
for
me
to
taste
it
for
it
to
come
alive
first
you
get
the
fizz
on
your
tongue
then
you
get
the
flavor
as
the
carbonation
dies
down
in
your
mouth
the
different
flavors
of
bread
fruits
and
a
metallic
alcohol
presence
that
i
associate
with
wine
come
about
it
isnt
that
it
tasted
different
with
each
sip
it
is
well
balanced
between
the
bread
and
jamlike
flavors
with
the
alcohol
resting
underneath
but
the
way
the
flavor
opens
up
in
your
mouth
with
the
strong
carbonation
apparently
starting
to
bubble
in
your
mouth
then
instantly
ceasing
to
reveal
a
marvelously
mixed
flavor
is
something
i
dont
recall
at
all
from
a
young
bottle
and
its
quite
an
entertaining
drinking
experience
and
it
maintains
that
fizzinyourmouth
quality
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
would
have
liked
to
review
alongside
a
fresh
bottle
but
these
are
big
bottles
off
my
memory
of
a
young
bottle
main
differences
as
far
as
flavor
the
young
bottle
i
remember
had
a
somewhat
sharp
presence
of
yeast
it
really
stood
out
and
brought
a
somewhat
bitter
funk
flavor
here
that
flavor
is
still
present
but
is
more
entwined
with
the
overallflavor
rather
than
tasting
like
an
element
that
stands
out
you
taste
more
of
the
fruity
malt
influence
and
a
slightly
dry
metallic
aftertaste
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
this
is
a
first
aged
beer
but
damn
it
shows
that
its
worth
the
time
an
all
around
tasty
belgian
pale
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
traditional
of
the
style
another
very
enjoyable
belgian
from
the
lost
abbey
o
overall
this
beer
is
more
interesting
than
many
others
in
this
style
powerful
yeast
driven
flavor
make
this
one
a
standout
overall
definitely
the
best
american
brewed
strong
golden
ale
ive
had
slightly
maltier
than
the
original
sga
duvel
well
balanced
and
begs
to
be
paired
with
some
freshly
grilled
salmon
and
a
green
salad
with
a
light
champagne
vinaigrette
drizzled
on
top
o
overall
inferno
this
is
heavenly
with
a
sweetly
well
balanced
flavor
that
flows
together
oh
so
smoothly
from
start
to
finish
a
lot
of
subtle
notes
bring
out
the
complexity
with
a
well
toned
nature
overall
as
i
said
objectively
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
has
a
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
really
appeals
to
me
the
light
funk
perhaps
or
the
annoying
head
in
any
case
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
o
had
to
force
this
beer
down
would
have
happily
dumped
it
down
the
drain
but
did
not
want
to
waste
the
trade
yuck
i
could
be
done
with
lost
abbey
beers
this
was
the
pits
a
nice
bottle
for
about
10
bucks
pours
a
fuzzy
pale
straw
color
with
some
suspended
yeast
and
a
growing
white
head
that
seems
to
stay
a
few
inches
tall
the
whole
time
it
smells
fresh
like
cut
grass
and
meadow
flowers
theres
some
fruity
pep
from
the
yeast
and
a
waft
of
alcohol
indicating
the
strength
of
this
one
it
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
more
springtime
than
fall
with
some
floral
notes
as
well
as
that
grassy
hop
complexion
it
finishes
very
quickly
and
is
bone
dry
its
not
bitter
but
there
is
a
strong
hop
presence
in
the
finish
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
great
excited
carbonation
from
the
belgian
yeast
a
deep
medium
body
and
a
moderate
alcohol
sting
i
love
the
dry
finish
too
perfect
for
this
type
of
brew
while
this
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
lost
abbey
selection
its
one
im
glad
i
purchased
its
different
than
many
other
beers
in
this
genre
and
it
was
the
perfect
if
ironic
choice
of
beer
for
making
my
annual
hot
sauce
for
canning
just
right
o
a
fantastic
bpa
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
this
should
be
a
goto
for
fans
of
the
style
spectacular
achievement
very
much
enjoyed
we
have
yet
another
winner
from
the
lost
abbey
line
of
beers
now
im
a
little
upset
at
myself
for
purchasing
the
smaller
bottle
and
not
the
larger
750
the
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
reddish
hue
with
a
load
of
white
foam
and
a
load
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
from
top
to
bottom
the
smell
of
carbonated
yeasty
bread
and
spices
was
evident
in
to
aroma
the
flavor
had
a
very
carbonated
yeasty
spicy
and
fruity
finish
well
balanced
and
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
not
bad
i
kind
of
like
it
from
a
corked
750
this
beer
is
a
straw
yellow
with
bright
clarity
on
the
first
pour
with
some
subsequent
yeast
haze
the
head
is
tall
firm
and
white
its
aroma
very
spicy
belgian
phenolic
and
grassy
some
malt
but
it
takes
a
backseat
to
the
complex
yeastiness
and
pepper
the
flavor
is
very
bitter
with
some
alcohol
warmth
no
real
sweetness
dry
and
firm
full
and
enjoyable
pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
very
nice
citrus
note
on
the
nose
yeast
and
some
spiciness
to
it
as
well
a
touch
of
alcohol
some
floral
hops
just
a
light
malt
sweetness
the
citrus
really
comes
through
on
the
nose
a
bit
citric
some
yest
some
spices
and
a
touch
of
booze
lightly
floral
quite
dry
and
a
light
sweetness
in
the
middle
wonderful
version
of
the
style
less
fruity
than
many
others
including
those
from
belgium
who
cares
this
one
is
a
winner
o
a
very
nice
spicy
belgianstyle
beer
its
damn
drinkable
for
9
i
basically
pounded
this
bottle
pretty
quickly
tasty
stuff
o
good
beer
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
for
a
beer
called
inferno
i
find
it
quite
refreshing
a
very
well
crafted
brew
that
is
so
nice
to
drink
solid
belgian
here
very
good
ale
here
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
the
complexity
of
the
several
flavors
working
together
i
would
put
this
up
there
with
other
big
names
of
the
style
for
sure
this
beer
aint
messing
around
it
knows
what
it
wants
and
does
it
well
deliver
a
serious
tasting
belgian
strong
pale
to
your
taste
buds
and
get
the
heck
out
of
there
this
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
ill
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
when
i
see
it
overall
i
will
buy
this
again
instead
of
la
fin
du
monde
just
as
good
and
one
heck
of
a
lot
cheaper
shortly
after
finishing
this
review
i
realized
that
i
had
no
desire
to
finish
the
bottle
and
ive
got
too
many
good
beers
on
hand
to
drink
another
pint
of
this
one
when
i
realized
i
was
about
to
drainpour
half
of
a
10
bomber
i
also
realized
my
rating
of
3
5
was
too
high
so
ive
adjusted
it
accordingly
overall
4
55
the
lost
abbeys
inferno
ale
is
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
a
belgian
ale
of
any
style
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
its
aroma
and
taste
are
both
top
notch
its
appearance
and
mouthfeel
both
help
to
enhance
the
former
two
and
the
overall
drinking
experience
this
is
another
great
ale
from
tomme
and
the
gang
at
the
lost
abbey
if
youre
into
strong
belgian
pale
ales
seek
it
out
d
very
well
done
the
bottle
conditioning
really
shows
here
and
helps
with
both
body
and
carbonation
making
this
one
of
if
not
the
best
american
made
belgians
that
i
have
had
to
date
overall
this
one
is
very
well
rounded
and
very
drinkable
the
rating
is
high
but
this
one
deserves
it
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
only
aged
it
for
a
few
months
but
it
might
be
a
candidate
for
much
longer
aging

a
slightly

color
a

fluffy

the

which
lasts
quite
a

we
love
this
brewery
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ale
that
is
refreshing
and
very
flavorful
superb
beer
paired
with
sushi
and
spicy
mayo
this
beer
really
cleans
the
palate
and
clears
the
heat
off
the
back
of
your
tongue
from
spicy
foods
such
an
incredibly
dry
clean
finish
o
wellbalanced
bold
flavors
crisp
highly
recommended
o
i
wish
there
was
also
a
scoring
button
for
the
label
because
this
one
is
epic
the
beer
in
the
bottle
is
pretty
darn
good
too
i
enjoyed
it
overall
pretty
solid
beer
and
a
fun
one
to
drink
carbonation
seems
to
hint
at
a
displeasure
but
even
this
big
its
actually
feels
like
an
enhancement
i
would
have
this
again
cheers

overall
this
was

a

the
wild

component
is
mild
enough
that
i
enjoyed
this
ale
id
probably
choose
a
belgian
over
this
because
of
the
dryness
but
it
is
well
made
and
enjoyable
o
an
unmitigated
success
that
cements
the
lost
abbey
in
my
mind
as
an
excellent
brewery
highly
recommended
if
you
like
belgian

i
would
drink
again
despite
the
steep
price

drinkable
and
undeniably
pleasant

wow
amazing

o
very

not
at

big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
on
super
bowl
sunday
as
a
pregame
snack
bottle
on

served
from
bottle
into
a
bells

tulip
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
pure
white
five
finger
head
that
subsided
to
three
fingers
very
slowly
it
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
floral
floral
hop
spices
banana
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
clove
fruit
floral
floral
hop
earth
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
the
appearance
was
pretty
nice
on
this
one
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
of
this
one
that
really
made
you
guess
on
the
style
of
this
brew
the
aroma
was
pretty
complex
too
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
but
i
know
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
to
be
able
to
see
how
different
this
one
is
from
the
bottle
first
things
first
i
inverted
the
bottle
to
get
some
of
that
yeasty
goodness
that
had
settled
i
did
notice
what
looked
like
long
stick
like
sedament
which
was
kinda
strange
i
blamed
the
cork
but
that
was
fully
intact
so
i
poured
it
and
got
a
nice
fruit
rind
arouma
look
is
foggy
golden
with
some
roasted
grains

cirus

it
does
make
you
wana
take
a
whiff
with

is
noticeble
but
not

great
beer
i
can

this

in

big
thanks
to
jay
from

o
solid

not
always
a

i
buy
but
i
am
very
happy
to
have
had
this

i
know
that
this
style
is
attempted
a
lot
by
domestic
brewers
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
seldom
done
without
numerous
flaws
however
not
this
offering
flavorful
yet
balanced
and
well
in
line
with
a
traditional
belgian
strong
pale
verdict
really
great
belgian
style
pale
ale
big
aromas
and
flavors
great
body
really
well
crafted
all
around
and
at
5
a
pretty
good
value
in
comparison
to
other
beers
in
this
style
like
la
chouffe
or
duvel
very
clear
well
filtered
beer
that
is
gold
in
color
for
the
body
and
a
very
fluffy
white
head
carbonation
just
keeps
coming
and
coming
yeast
is
pronounced
in
the
front
of
this
earthy
herbal
cloves
almost
masala
like
taste
is
vanilla
herbal
and
floral
yeast
is
still
very
much
there
nice
alcohol
burn
to
finish
carbonation
is
high
which
give
the
impression
of
being
a
light
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
very
versatile
i
had
several
sips
of
this
to
begin
and
felt
that
is
a
great
stand
alone
beer
however
i
had
to
sit
down
for
lunch
and
wasnt
finished
with
it
yet
had
it
with
some
nepali
food
great
combo
pairs
well
with
food
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
would
have
this
again
overall
my
first
lost
abbey
beer
and
i
am
impressed
the
lemon
flavour
is
very
fresh
and
vibrant
and
the
spicy
notes
give
it
a
very
interesting
taste
it
has
a
great
dry
aftertaste
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
worth
seeking
out
final
thought
5
and

abv
this
is
a
great
ale
very
lovely
indeed
o
overall
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
has
an
earthy
quality
to
it
poured
a
hazy
brownish
orange
immense
offwhite
head
thats
dense
soapy
with
huge
lacing
nose
is
yeasty
and
fruity
quite
duvellike
great
hop
notes
light
grassy
and
green
apple
notes
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
general
sweetness
taste
reflects
the
nose
great
fruitiness
a
little
spice
in
the
finish
yeasty
and
lightly
grainy
finish
dry
and
gentle
effervescence
a
very
nice
golden
strong
stands
up
nicely
to
duvel
and
i
would
revisit
this
regularly
if
available
locally
yeah
right
impressive
great
beer
with
a
wellhandled
funky
palate
slightly
off
flavours
are
far
from
offputting
overall
a
fantastic
brew
would
seek
it
out
for
sure
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
great
belgianfromanonbelgian
this
had
style
and
sophistication
far
above
its
genesis
good
work
o
good
first
review
for
lost
abbery
i
could
have
done
without
some
o
the
herbal
character
but
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
o
very
solid
bspa
duvel
is
still
king
but
this
makes
for
a
nice
runnerup
effervescent
body
light
and
bubbly
dry
aftertaste
dried
apricot
and
pear
flavors
some
floral
notes
also
crisp
with
some
dusty
sweetness
lingering
yeast
esters
very
slight
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
decent
but
probably
not
something
id
go
for
again
as
the
sweetness
limits
the
appeal
personally
great
flavors
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
much
on
the
finish
o
i
like
it
i
enjoy
a
drier
belgianstyle
ale
after
so
many
sweet
american
interpretations
tasty
pours
a
crisp
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
apples
pears
and
some
nice
spice
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
complex
and
refreshing
with
flavors
of
freshly
ground
black
pepper
crisp
juicy
apples
and
pears
belgian
yeast
and
some
sweet
malt
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
very
sweet
hides
the
alcohol
well
o
this
is
a
very
delicious
belgian
strong
pale
and
i
would
thoroughly
recommend
it
o
now
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
this
is
up
there
with
one
of
my
favorites
the
horny
devil
i
will
be
back
for
more
25oz
bottle
surprisingly
clear
and
light
golden
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
yeasty
and
fruity
very
reminiscent
of
some
staple
belgium
strong
blonde
offerings
light
tropical
fruits
balanced
by
a
moderate
hop
presence
nothing
to
freak
out
about
but
good
o
very
balanced
malt
and
yeast
character
nice
looking
beer
too
o
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
tasty
brew
overall
is
real
good
highly
drinkable
and
yet
another
great
lost
abbey
beer
worth
drinking
again
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
hazy
yellow
color
not
really
what
i
expected
when
i
read
the
name
of
the
beer
the
head
that
formed
as
i
poured
this
one
out
was
big
rocky
and
white
pretty
good
lacing
on
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
off
a
decent
amount
of
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
rather
mild
also
i
thought
that
maybe
there
would
be
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
in
there
but
i
wasnt
getting
any
from
what
i
could
tell
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
pretty
smooth
a
very
easy
going
drink
overall
i
liked
it
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
one
day
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
belgianstyle
ale
another
good
one
from
the
lost
abbey
finish
is
lightly
lingering
with
the
hops
bringing
citrus
and
a
little
pine
needle
do
drinkability
is
moderate
the
appearance
nose
and
mouthfeel
were
all
great
but
the
breadiness
is
a
bit
much
in
the
flavor
at
the
pricepoint
i
would
probably
stick
with
something
more
balanced
like
a
duvel
overall
its
a
solid
beer
pleasing
aroma
and
taste
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
have
much
negative
to
say
really
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
beer
not
overly
complex
but
a
wonderful
blend
of
subtle
flavors
make
a
sweet
interesting
easy
to
drink
strong
ale
overall
a
very
nice
and
comforting
beer
something
i
might
drink
if
i
was
in
nosferatus
castle
after
a
long
journey
through
the
canyon
i
am
seriously
trying
to
get
into
belgian
beers
it
is
a
hit
or
miss
and
this
counts
for
both
domestic
and
imported
beers
after
popping
the
cork
and
pouring
into
my
snifter
it
looked
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
less
filtered
the
smell
was
sweet
and
spicy
but
nothing
special
the
taste
was
a
little
better
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
got
a
bit
more
spice
but
was
not
savoring
every
sip
i
got
bored
with
it
pretty
quick
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
nothing
special
overall
this
was
good
but
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
i
was
left
with
my
desires
unsatisfied
the
carbonation
was
there
but
did
not
clean
the
palate
like
i
would
have
liked
the
strong
portions
of
the
flavor
stuck
around
a
bit
too
long
lost
abbey
makes
some
good
brews
despite
my
warm
buzz
at
the
end
of
the
entire
bottle
i
felt
as
if
i
was
ripped
off
by
the
brewer
id
rather
have
a
damnation
or
a
pranqster
which
can
be
argued
as
a
different
classification
but
for
american
brewed
belgian
goldenpale
ales
this
one
is
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
however
many
may
think
i
am
wrong
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
nearly
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
hard
not
to
compare
this
duvel
but
it
does
not
really
measure
up
to
that
level
but
good
in
its
own
right
with
a
different
mix
of
flavors
solid
brew
overall
this
beer
is
a
tad
bit
sweet
for
me
there
are
just
too
many
fruit
flavors
going
on
this
beer
would
go
down
very
smoothly
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
relaxing
day
at
the
beach
o
herbal
throughout
does
an
incredible
job
of
hiding
its
booze
at
8
5
drink
pretty
tasty
little
beer
had
good
flavors
and
was
pretty
light
at
the
same
time
for
a
small
bottle
ill
come
back
to
it
overall
its
good
not
duvel
good
but
iirc
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
dryer
bone
dry
indeed
somewhat
husky
and
abrasive
as
well
very
little
residual
sweetness
the
golden
fruits
id
expect
from
this
style
are
fairly
subdued
and
lack
the
smooth
airy
quality
i
want
from
this
bspa
overall
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
strong
pale
ales
around
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
suspect
that
i
will
be
buying
and
drink
many
more
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
honey
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
some
nice
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
a
mixture
of
aromas
of
pepperoniavacadoesbarley
wheat
and
herbal
hopsit
has
a
lightmedium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
allows
the
tastes
of
honeydewminiwheatspepperoni
and
grapefruit
all
to
combine
nicely
before
being
infused
with
a
nice
hit
of
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
and
overall
an
enjoyable
ale
that
hides
its
abv
very
well
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
very
spicy
and
it
fills
the
mouth
to
an
extreme
first
ever
beer
from
the
lost
abbey
i
think
and
i
like
what
they
did
with
it
overall
this
beer
has
some
of
my
favorite
characteristics
for
the
style
i
like
the
yeast
and
spice
but
when
the
green
apple
and
pear
fruit
flavors
are
allowed
to
shine
through
and
lend
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
the
taste
it
works
best
for
me
this
beer
hits
on
those
counts
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
taste
but
its
easy
drinking
for
the
most
part
definitely
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
of
8
5
carbonation
is
way
down
from
my
first
review
as
there
was
barely
any
head
and
virtually
no
prickly
carbonation
in
the
body
much
fruitier
and
sweeter
than
my
original
review
still
plenty
of
yeasty
spiciness
and
reminded
me
of
a
fiery
hell
when
i
first
took
a
sip
of
this
one
bitterness
is
way
down
mustve
mellowed
after
sitting
for
two
years
ive
been
sitting
on
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
months
with
the
fourth
snowfall
in
as
many
weeks
i
figured
that
it
was
time
to
pull
out
a
special
beer
to
celebrate
such
a
special
occasion
cork
was
a
little
tough
to
pull
out
so
i
was
concerned
about
a
yeasty
pour
but
this
is
actually
relatively
clear
with
nice
carbonation
color
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
smells
super
fruity
with
a
pleasant
almost
cherry
aroma
theres
light
cereal
in
the
background
too
smells
pretty
damn
good
no
head
retention
but
then
again
im
using
a
chimay
glass
so
theres
really
none
needed
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
theres
a
ton
of
flavor
hitting
the
mouth
at
once
trying
to
catalog
the
tastes
is
a
fools
errand
theres
a
slight
sour
funkiness
that
starts
followed
by
by
some
surprising
levels
of
spice
the
spice
recedes
and
theres
this
wonderful
belgian
fruitiness
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
with
some
light
citrus
melon
and
pear
notes
bleeding
through
mild
citrus
hop
character
helps
to
usher
in
a
bone
dry
finish
simply
wonderful
and
it
only
gets
better
as
you
let
the
beer
warm
up
the
high
abv
is
never
really
all
that
noticeable
and
the
light
body
with
the
dry
finish
means
you
want
to
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
it
even
if
you
probably
shouldnt
very
good
and
would
easily
make
it
into
my
usual
rotation
if
i
could
find
it
more
often
around
here
o
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
pale
ale
i
loved
the
smell
the
mix
of
cloves
belgian
yeast
and
bananas
was
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
belgian
ale
while
the
taste
was
fine
it
just
had
too
much
pepper
and
spice
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
more
as
it
warmed
up
and
it
is
something
i
would
certainly
give
another
shot
to
my
advice
is
to
let
this
one
warm
up
a
little
bit
so
more
comes
out
in
the
taste
very
drinkable
for
8
5
abv
a
bit
raw
but
a
good
representative
for
the
style
anyway
the
abv
is
really
well
hidden
on
this
one
you
dont
taste
it
at
all
but
of
course
you
do
feel
it
as
you
work
your
way
through
the
bottle
im
a
big
fan
of
these
cc
375ml
bottles
for
the
bigger
abv
beers
pours
a
five
finger
thick
white
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
light
amber
color
ton
of
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
tart
fruit
flavor
is
sweet
and
tart
fruit
smooth
higher
abv
is
hidden
10
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
overall
impression
high
alcohol
and
tasty
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
out
the
bottle
a
golden
belgian
with
a
nice
head
and
lace
not
much
on
the
aroma
front
balanced
but
nothing
stands
out
given
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgians
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
outstanding
the
balance
of
flavor
and
alcohol
content
leaving
your
tongue
with
a
nice
little
after
taste
that
only
make
you
want
to
drink
more
overall
definitely
one
of
the
better
strong
belgians
ive
had
mine
was
light
on
carbonation
and
i
consider
that
a
plus
for
the
style
pure
clear
straw
yellow
at
first
but
plenty
of
sediment
so
cloudy
later
tons
of
bright
fruit
yet
dry
some
grasshay
and
spice
sweetness
in
the
nose
yet
actual
sweetness
gobbled
up
by
the
yeast
will
pair
well
with
food
especially
cheese
like
many
in
the
lost
abbey
repertoire
perfect
for
one
beer
with
a
meal
not
sessionable
and
i
would
never
touch
this
after
anything
with
serious
hops
share
a
bottle
with
a
cheese
plate
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
fruity
and
a
little
malty
with
a
nice
crisp
edge
slightly
sweet
and
fairly
inviting
it
pours
a
hazy
solar
yellow
with
a
very
thick
white
persistent
head
that
leaves
some
thick
lacing
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
mainly
pear
with
a
little
apple
a
hint
of
honey
and
a
subtle
alcohol
bite
texture
is
very
smooth
somewhat
thick
and
quite
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
nice
tingle
d
its
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
you
obviously
wouldnt
look
to
this
for
refreshment
overall
its
very
tasty
and
finishing
the
bottle
was
no
problem
awesome
wicked
golden
cloudy
ale
with
all
kinds
of
fruity
esters
in
the
flavor
finishes
dry
and
clean
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
or
whatever
its
trying
to
be
little
bitterness
there
wavering
in
the
background
but
in
the
end
the
dry
beats
the
bitter
or
the
sweet
sweet
d
i
have
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
and
would
not
hesitate
to
seek
it
out
again
cheers
i
have
had
other
lost
abbey
stuff
and
have
been
impressed
by
what
was
done
but
those
never
really
paid
homage
to
the
abbey
like
this
one
has
i
was
looking
for
it
i
found
it
and
it
was
worth
it
experience
the
west
coast
of
america
bring
you
a
true
flavor
from
belgium
d
i
love
a
good
belgian
golden
strong
and
this
one
was
good
it
however
was
missing
some
carbonation
characteristics
relating
to
crispness
of
finish
head
retention
and
lacing
that
make
it
a
notch
lower
than
the
stylistic
examples
good
flavors
that
are
balanced
between
spice
and
fruit
will
rereview
after
sampling
it
from
a
bottle
with
the
appropriate
glassware
pours
a
very
murky
golden
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
is
very
fluffy
and
hangs
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
extremely
spicy
probably
the
spiciest
scents
ive
ever
gotten
in
a
beer
there
are
also
hints
of
green
apple
and
belgian
yeast
but
the
spice
overpowers
by
a
lot
taste
is
initially
lemon
and
green
apples
followed
by
tons
of
spice
and
pepper
with
hints
of
banana
and
a
lot
of
yeasty
flavors
there
are
also
light
bread
flavors
beer
finishes
with
very
boozy
strong
alcohol
flavor
like
vodka
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
very
crisp
and
full
drinkability
is
fair
this
is
no
duvel
thats
for
sure
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
with
almost
brown
tones
in
the
deepest
parts
there
is
a
large
foamy
light
head
approx
2
the
beer
has
citrus
notes
on
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
some
spices
to
balance
the
flavors
are
of
very
light
citrus
with
a
blended
spice
tasting
of
coriander
and
nutmeg
very
smooth
in
mouth
and
a
crisp
light
finish
the
alcohol
helps
balance
the
sweet
and
spice
flavors
and
the
spice
follows
through
to
the
aftertaste
almost
peppery
notes
on
the
aftertaste
also
very
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
kind
of
wishing
i
had
grabbed
a
few
more
bottles
of
it
while
we
were
at
the
brewery
the
mouthfeel
is
really
dry
as
the
awesome
label
says
nice
on
the
palate
the
drinkability
isnt
too
high
for
me
its
just
a
little
hard
to
put
down
too
long
nice
beer
overall
this
one
pours
pale
gold
with
a
one
inch
head
smells
of
apples
and
yeast
and
tastes
of
apples
yeast
with
a
wee
bit
of
sourness
in
there
that
was
a
little
disappointing
overall
the
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
and
the
touch
of
sourness
made
this
one
slightly
less
than
first
rate
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
d
this
was
my
least
favorite
la
brew
to
date
however
id
like
to
give
this
one
another
go
in
the
future
just
to
see
if
my
taste
buds
were
just
off
this
night
dthe
huge
soapy
flavors
and
the
assertive
bitterness
make
this
somewhat
off
putting
the
flavors
are
all
there
but
they
dont
seem
to
work
that
well
together
it
isnt
bad
the
malt
body
is
still
nicely
done
and
the
assertive
hop
finish
is
different
just
too
soapy
poured
a
hazy
pale
golden
orange
in
color
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thick
finger
of
head
and
left
plenty
of
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
fruity
belgian
yeast
upfront
alongside
citrus
slight
spice
apple
esters
and
mild
hop
notes
it
also
had
a
good
malty
presence
the
taste
was
also
pretty
fruity
from
the
belgian
yeast
with
clove
spice
apple
pear
and
citrus
accents
there
was
plenty
of
malts
and
a
touch
of
underlying
hops
to
cap
off
the
flavor
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
spice
citrusy
and
malty
finish
it
drank
real
good
and
really
did
some
justice
for
the
style
ive
had
this
brew
a
few
times
know
and
each
time
has
been
solid
without
the
la
carbonation
issues
mouth
feel
is
really
nice
with
a
thicker
tasting
body
yet
lots
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
and
i
found
the
citrus
rind
a
little
overpowering
which
made
it
a
little
less
drinkable
md
crisp
but
full
bodied
very
dry
excellent
bspa
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
ample
head
impressive
adhesion
the
lace
defies
gravity
abundant
carbonation
observed
aroma
is
very
floral
and
the
taste
features
mild
estery
banana
notes
with
a
definite
hop
presence
mouth
feel
is
somewhat
astringent
but
drinkability
is
high
jd
taste
is
of
well
belgian
yeast
not
too
malty
and
hopish
unfortunately
for
me
the
hop
flavor
tends
to
overpower
the
belgian
flavor
i
think
raging
bitch
does
a
much
better
job
of
balancing
the
two
components
it
is
a
fairly
lighter
bodied
beer
with
lends
itself
to
drinkability
though
i
cant
really
recommend
it
thanks
to
afatty
for
including
an
extra
for
me
in
his
order
of
lost
abbey
beers
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
hopus
glass
pours
a
nice
bubbly
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
frothy
pale
almost
yellow
head
that
takes
its
time
dying
down
to
a
thin
layer
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
loads
of
pale
malts
and
spices
such
as
coriander
and
lemon
zest
taste
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
plethora
of
citrus
hops
pale
malts
and
spices
all
dancing
together
in
perfect
harmony
on
the
tongue
sweet
fruits
pepper
clove
and
lemon
all
add
a
nice
accent
to
an
already
complex
brew
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
to
wrap
up
a
hot
summer
day
one
i
would
certainly
love
to
have
again
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
and
is
a
great
beer
to
linger
upon
highly
recommended
d
this
is
one
tasty
beer
one
of
the
better
ive
had
of
the
style
and
certainly
top
of
the
pile
for
americans
paired
wonderfully
with
a
bacon
wrapped
fillet
with
blue
cheese
on
top
savory
corn
pudding
and
broccoli
rabe
ahhh
overall
this
is
a
wow
beer
for
me
its
just
great
if
you
like
orval
or
duvel
you
need
to
try
this
and
it
is
worth
trading
for
another
nice
beer
from
lost
abbey
taste
ugh
sweet
alcohol
overpowers
i
thought
this
might
be
a
little
hoppy
like
mischief
its
a
little
peppery
maybe
plum
getting
clove
in
the
mouthfeel
of
this
ah
so
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
whole
bottle
and
waited
to
check
it
out
at
the
sdibf
finishes
too
hot
no
pun
intended
cant
recommend
d
really
a
bigflavored
beer
tastes
wonderful
with
it
takes
a
while
to
kick
a
bottle
of
this
would
probably
be
wonderful
with
some
stinky
washrind
cheeses
d
very
good
nothing
stands
out
but
just
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
abv
barely
noticeable
really
grew
on
me
after
the
first
8oz
or
so
md
medium
body
with
tons
of
carbonation
that
finshes
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
wonderful
refreshing
flavor
makes
it
real
easy
to
drink
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
adds
to
the
characteristic
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
different
i
get
some
smoke
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
as
well
as
wheat
the
flavor
is
belgian
yeast
biscuit
malt
wheat
honey
caramel
and
toffee
i
didnt
expect
the
caramel
and
toffee
notes
in
this
beer
since
it
was
yellow
in
color
but
they
are
a
welcome
surprise
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
bone
dry
and
i
dig
it
seems
spot
on
for
the
style
d
its
decent
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
for
this
beer
in
particular
overall
this
was
delish
and
i
would
buy
it
again
in
a
second
if
they
sold
it
in
or
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
dry
belgian
that
has
saison
qualities
to
it
while
i
do
want
this
again
i
would
sooner
choose
other
lost
abbey
beers
first
a
very
good
nice
and
fruityfunky
beer
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
nose
the
yeast
flavor
was
there
but
also
not
overpowering
so
you
could
still
get
a
nice
taste
the
spices
and
light
citrus
combined
came
out
well
tomee
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
pretty
drinkable
for
a
begiun
beer
i
suppose
the
huge
clove
and
dry
body
make
this
beer
a
little
less
drinkable
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
a
very
good
belgium
strong
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
the
8
5
is
barely
noticeable
while
drinking
but
it
creeps
up
on
you
i
felt
it
before
i
was
midway
through
otherwise
this
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
that
makes
this
perfect
year
round
d
while
the
taste
is
pleasing
the
alcohol
is
the
only
off
putting
piece
however
this
is
minor
i
went
back
for
one
last
pour
and
with
all
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
a
lot
of
it
made
its
way
into
my
glass
i
get
a
big
taste
of
old
cheese
now
which
is
a
good
thing
for
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
good
tasting
belgian
ale
belgians
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
a
very
good
one
review
from
notes
taken
115
d
not
bad
a
bit
too
bitter
for
a
belgian
im
drinking
it
on
its
own
so
maybe
with
certain
foods
it
could
balance
out
d
very
very
drinkable
this
was
my
introduction
to
lost
abbey
and
absolutely
did
not
disappoint
ive
come
to
expect
a
lot
from
the
lost
abbey
beers
but
this
one
really
blew
me
away
the
best
beer
ive
had
by
them
hands
down
overall
another
very
good
brew
from
lost
abbey
although
nothing
groundbreaking
definitely
worth
a
try
though
75cl
bottle
purchased
early
this
summer
down
in
orange
county
crystal
clear
maybe
a
touch
darker
shade
of
gold
than
duvel
they
didnt
really
hide
the
fact
that
they
were
basing
inferno
on
the
original
devil
of
beers
himself
so
excuse
the
flagrant
comparisons
the
head
almost
lackadaisically
rose
to
the
rim
of
my
duvel
tulip
but
manages
to
stay
there
for
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
plethora
of
lace
in
its
wake
and
remaining
as
a
nice
pad
of
white
foam
for
the
duration
of
the
beers
stay
in
the
glass
ample
carbonation
trails
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
leaves
an
initial
impression
of
doughy
malt
and
yeast
with
pear
strawberry
lemon
and
spicy
hops
adding
subtle
complexity
in
the
mouth
there
is
an
initial
fruity
sweetness
that
is
quickly
taken
over
by
spicy
hops
and
bitter
fruit
peel
cracked
grain
and
honey
also
seem
to
add
the
to
the
sweet
quality
though
the
finish
dries
out
pretty
well
with
hops
and
alcohol
the
body
is
light
with
carbonation
on
the
higher
side
and
a
dry
feel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
love
duvel
and
this
may
not
be
spot
on
but
is
just
as
enjoyable
seems
like
people
are
expecting
something
fro
this
beer
that
it
never
promises
in
the
first
place
i
mean
the
style
was
belgiums
answer
to
the
pilsener
for
what
its
worth
drinkability
was
impressive
this
is
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
would
make
for
a
perfect
aperitif
da
nice
tribute
to
duvel
certainly
not
as
good
but
then
again
nothing
to
drain
pour
d
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
yet
ridiculously
complex
that
keeps
you
guessing
its
criminal
to
not
consider
this
a
sipper
though
due
to
how
nice
and
complex
this
beer
is
fantastic
stuff
the
taste
is
nice
and
light
there
is
sweet
orangy
start
with
a
nice
light
hop
finish
pretty
complex
taste
that
sticks
to
your
tongue
nice
mouthfeel
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
didnt
really
have
any
objection
to
this
beer
but
it
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
either
this
beer
betrays
the
name
bestowed
upon
it
pours
out
clearly
very
light
and
vibrant
with
a
citrus
scent
however
it
is
not
an
inferno
of
taste
smell
or
sight
a
good
belgian
but
not
a
great
beer
the
taste
is
fairly
good
with
a
lot
of
background
flavors
lots
of
malt
and
hops
which
is
balanced
out
by
the
carbonation
d
decently
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
5
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
make
a
session
out
of
good
stuff
overall
a
nice
bsa
a
little
less
than
my
favorite
belgian
version
but
nice
indeed
pretty
damn
drinkable
with
good
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
came
come
up
to
bite
you
i
would
grab
this
one
again
if
im
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
belgian
golden
ale
d
good
nothing
too
special
here
a
solid
example
of
the
style
excellent
drinkability
in
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
here
is
really
amazing
and
the
beer
looks
great
too
it
just
feels
a
bit
lacking
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
and
i
wish
that
the
alcohol
and
aftertaste
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
still
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
big
thanks
to
cletus
for
the
bottle
taste
is
lightly
sweet
to
tart
lemony
in
the
center
with
spiciness
coming
in
on
the
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
d
complex
flavors
with
an
overall
mellow
vibe
overall
a
solid
beer
one
that
ill
be
getting
again
its
controlled
beer
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
its
8
5
sneaks
up
on
you
instead
of
inferno
is
should
be
rogue
as
it
silently
takes
you
out
when
you
think
all
is
well
drinkability
is
again
fantastic
no
hint
of
alcohol
dryness
lends
a
refreshing
quality
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
meaning
this
one
slides
right
in
effortlessly
beautiful
beer
the
badass
infernal
name
label
imagery
and
text
dont
really
match
this
nice
polite
clean
ale
but
this
is
no
slouch
or
wimp
of
a
beer
either
perhaps
something
of
a
more
angelic
persuasion
wouldve
been
more
fitting
no
matter
this
nonbeliever
found
inferno
ale
to
be
a
delightful
experience
and
a
morethanworthy
tribute
to
realdeal
belgians
of
a
similar
kind
even
if
it
was
supposedly
brewed
by
the
devil
youd
swear
inferno
ale
was
a
gift
from
the
heavens
it
is
tasty
palatable
and
refreshing
my
mouth
waters
at
the
thought
of
how
this
would
fair
with
a
number
of
my
favourite
dishes
tomme
arthur
will
surely
go
down
as
one
of
the
most
talented
and
inspirational
brewers
even
in
an
era
that
knows
no
lack
of
talented
and
inspirational
brewers
i
hope
we
see
this
one
again
a
fine
beverage
for
just
about
any
occasion
thanks
to
wastrinkensie
for
a
real
nice
one
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
bite
has
a
light
and
airy
feel
to
it
and
the
hops
are
nice
and
plentiful
tastes
like
a
finely
crafted
belgian
ale
has
a
welcoming
yeasty
funk
with
the
last
few
dregs
swirled
in
there
its
a
good
beer
that
is
true
to
the
style
but
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
for
popping
my
lost
abbey
cherry
d
easy
to
finish
and
something
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
sooner
another
success
from
lost
abbey
something
ill
come
back
to
highly
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
strawyellow
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
giant
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
fantastic
lacing
i
hardly
ever
give
5s
for
appearancebut
this
is
a
special
beer
the
smell
is
not
as
outstanding
as
the
appearance
some
tart
applepepperlemonand
wheat
are
presentbut
its
not
all
that
strong
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
lemonpepperbread
yeastalcoholtart
fruitand
wheat
the
mf
is
light
for
a
high
octane
brew
and
all
the
flavors
mix
well
all
in
alla
damn
good
beer
that
if
you
can
find
ittry
it
this
was
sent
to
me
by
tomme
arthur
directly
replacement
for
a
flat
bottle
and
he
was
confident
of
its
carbonation
boy
is
this
one
carbonated
its
a
damn
shame
their
stuff
is
so
inconsistent
from
beer
to
beer
but
if
they
were
all
like
this
that
is
consistent
and
having
the
appropriate
carbonation
for
the
style
id
be
a
damn
happy
customer
inferno
overall
is
a
pretty
solid
bspa
the
nose
and
body
could
use
a
little
work
carbonation
is
a
little
low
but
it
is
carbonated
no
worries
about
that
here
i
like
the
flavor
id
like
a
little
more
yeast
and
spice
flavors
but
their
slightly
weak
nature
doesnt
hurt
it
too
much
lost
abbey
did
a
more
than
respectable
job
with
this
one
definitely
worth
checking
out
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
d
even
with
the
abv
easy
to
drink
for
sure
m
surprisingly
light
body
given
the
smells
i
got
from
this
beer
after
all
the
spices
adjuncts
i
smelled
i
expected
a
big
heavy
taste
but
this
is
light
almost
crisp
tasted
again
recently
and
got
a
slightly
more
pilsner
malt
and
much
more
pear
aroma
and
flavor
than
previously
adjusted
the
drinkability
up
a
notch
but
other
than
that
things
are
fairly
similar
still
worth
a
shot
d
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
the
well
hidden
alcohol
makes
this
beer
one
that
can
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
overall
a
very
nice
pickup
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
that
looks
just
like
grapefruit
juice
smells
of
beautiful
funky
wild
yeast
first
sip
is
funky
and
yeasty
that
is
on
the
mellow
side
and
not
too
over
the
top
there
some
grapefruit
notes
present
but
again
not
over
the
top
a
tad
on
the
bready
side
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
this
puppy
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
to
boot

inferno
ale
falls
far
short
of
duvel
but
then
every
other
bspa
on
the
planet
does
as
well
in
the
end
this
is
a
semiimpressive
ale
from
a
brewery
that
produces
far
more
hits
than
misses
if
you
have
any
interest
in
the
style
its
also
an
easy
recommendation
having
not
had
many
belgian
strong
pales
this
one
was
pretty
damn
solid
it
was
wellconstructed
and
flavorful
enough
to
hold
my
interest
for
the
whole
bottle
yes
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
myself
given
my
limited
exposure
to
quality
belgian
ales
id
rate
this
as
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
and
a
pretty
tasty
one
at
that
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
actually
think
i
might
give
this
one
another
chance
decent
but
duvel
is
much
much
better
good
but
not
great
im
missing
some
depth
and
complexity
still
worth
a
try
very
solid
i
am

liking

thanks
again
eric
i
really
appreciate
the
super
cool
trade
d
so
far
this
is
the
most
impressive
of
the
yearround
la
beers
that
weve
tried
so
far
very
nice
very
nicely
done
would
get
this
again
tastes
fantabulous
excellent
balance
starts
off
saisony
very
crisp
and
sweet
with
lots
of
flowers
and
lemon
this
moves
into
a
honey
sweet
middle
thats
lightly
peppery
and
strongly
wonderfully
alcoholic
normally
things
would
fizzle
out
after
that
but
here
we
move
into
a
tremendous
yeast
profile
that
lingers
long
after
the
beers
been
swallowed
sweet
fruit
and
burny
booze
the
yeast
tastes
like
a
blend
between
west
coast
usa
and
straightup
belgian
and
it
really
really
works
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
body
with
a
humongous
craggy
white
head
very
lasting
extremely
floral
aroma
sweet
and
belgiany
sweet
spiciness
present
too
muted
watery
palate
some
sweet
spiciness
some
hotness
present
a
nice
floral
taste
but
not
a
lot
more
alcohol
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
up
more
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
hidden
very
well
almost
too
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
a
winner
d
i
had
no
issues
polishing
off
a
bottle
but
it
is
a
bit
telling
i
could
almost
guess
they
add
fruit
juice
to
this
beer
it
is
just
so
juicy
and
full
of
complex
layered
fruit
flavors
very
peachy
in
the
mouth
with
nectarine
as
well
ad
a
grapefruit
with
some
alcohol
burn
in
the
chest
some
spice
with
great
yeasty
finish
and
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
well
a
perfumey
finish
hell
just
a
long
complex
interestig
finish
good
carbonation
and
slightly
creamy
in
the
middle
great
beer
here
d
would
definitely
have
again
im
sorry
it
only
comes
in
750ml
would
love
to
have
another
12oz
or
so
to
top
off
the
bottle
for
the
night
smooth
and
even
a
little
watery
with
a
prickly
mouth
tingling
carbonation
it
matches
well
with
the
flavors
and
overall
theme
of
this
fine
ale
d
good
drinkability
fine
d
the
ale
is
only
8
5
it
feels
like
an
11
behemoth
at
the
midpoint
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
but
walk
away
underwhelmed
and
with
a
b
rating
that
is
sayin
something
d
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
it
was
not
bad
by
any
means
it
just
left
me
not
caring
about
it
sort
of
a
meh
experience
for
me
i
dont
regret
trying
it
and
will
do
so
again
someday
but
this
time
i
was
not
very
impressed
light
yellow
body
and
lots
of
lasting
white
head
with
lots
of
lace
left
in
the
glass
a
funkly
yeast
that
gives
it
a
funky
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
metallic
taste
kind
of
soso
for
the
brewer
i
think
this
will
become
my
next
meat
tenderizer
thanks

d
easy
overall
a
nice
belgian
its
lighter
and
fruitier
than
expected
but
the
sweetness
is
offset
well
by
the
yeast
it
is
nice
and
drinkable
pours
clear
gold
with
a
puffy
white
head
lemon
citrus
and
spice
in
the
nose
fair
amount
of
the
same
in
the
taste
but
with
honey
and
earthy
farmhouse
notes
taverner
made
a
great
call
with
the
sangrialike
flavor
of
this
one
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
still
enjoyable
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
belgian
pale
that
opened
up
nicely
as
it
warmed
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
spiced
and
hoppy
in
the
finish
hv
nice
beer
for
certain
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
d
lovely
very
drinkable
one
glass
invites
another
now
where
are
my
mussels
and
frites
d
this
is
wonderful
light
and
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
while
sipping
i
was
really
enjoying
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
with
its
different
layers
the
only
complaint
that
i
have
is
the
mouthfeel
could
be
much
more
smooth
and
yeasty
good
beer
and
would
buy
or
trade
for
it
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
special
but
a
solid
lost
abbey
beer
pours
a
sunshiney

bubbles

their

to
the
top
of
this
bubbly
brew
yeasty

some
soft
hoppy
grass
clippings
make
up
the
brunt
of
this
brews
nose
dried
citrus
fruts
in
a
bag
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
nectarines
mandarin
oranges
limes
and
even
some
grapefruits
the
finish
is
an
herbal
grassy
yet
slightly
sugary
hop
pretty
dry
palate
a
little
sweetness
and
more
of
a
pronounced
hop
profile
for
a
belgian
beer
than
im
used
to
very
easy
to
drink
cosidering
the
high
abv
drinkability
and
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
liked
this
the
8
5
abv
is
surprising
for
a
beer
with
this
flavor
and
feel
i
wont
run
out
and
get
more
but
if
someone
gave
me
some
id
drink
it
i
would
conclude
that
this
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
a
bit
too
carbonated
than
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
nice
but
difficult
to
make

on

to

get
some
now
d
lost
abbey
is
an
amazing
brewery
that
is
changing
the
shape
of
american
brewing
from
a
hop
head
and
macro
lager
dominated
arena
to
one
heavy
influenced
by
the
belgian
and
french
brewing
traditions
every
one
of
their
beers
deserves
a
tasting
and
sharing
among
friends
mfd
very
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
it
is
very
light
for
the
8
5
abv
tag
could
drink
these
all
night
before
you
knew
what
hit
you
in
the
end
while
not
my
favorite
thing
from
lost
abbey
it
was
definitely
solid
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
it
seems
like
it
makes
a
very
nice
addition
to
their
regular
lineup
drinkability
if
you
like
a
hoppy
belgian
then
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
to
my
palate
however
there
are
others
in
this
series
i
prefer
d
a
tasty
beer
not
quite
to
the
level
of
a
damnation
or
delirium
tremens
but
a
damn
enjoyable
brew
i
wish
the
flavor
were
just
a
bit
more
overstated
they
do
avoid
the
overhoppiness
that
devotion
seems
to
suffer
from
though
which
is
a
bonus
alcohol
is
enough
to
get
a
buzz
but
doesnt
really
smack
you
in
the
face
combined
with
the
relative
smoothness
this
is
a
frighteningly
drinkable
beer
lost

rarely

mouthfeel

if
la
would
send
us
more
than
4
styles
good
beer
and
thanks
again
to
my
man
wetpaperbag
d
not
a
spot
on
duvel
clone
but
kinda
close
and
tasty
nonetheless
drinks
pretty
easy
with
minimal
alcohol
showing
through
this
is
my
first
foray
into
lost
abbey
although
i
have
a
couple
more
in
the
basement
for
a
rainy
day
maybe
its
just
the
stylish
bomber
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
radical
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
the
hellion
i
was
expecting
good
stuff
its
good
overall
but
maybe
not
as
subtle
as
i
would
prefer
i
definately
need
some
cheese
and
crackers
to
take
the
edge
off
and
an
ice
pack
to
numb
my
sore
hand
great
work
from
lost
abbey
but
as
a
drinker
ill
just
stick
to
the
real
thing
pours
a
cloudy
gold
in
color
nice
frothy
head
forms
on
the
pour
smell
is
very
floral
and
fruity
a
little
bit
of
spice
taste
is
much
more
floral
there
is
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
flavor
as
well
decent
and
good
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
dont
notice
the
abv
at
all
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
a
descent
shot
at
the
style
this
would
go
great
with
thai
sushi
or
indian
imo
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
one
of
the
better
lost
abbey
beers
if
you
like
a
spicy
and
hoppy
version
of
the
style
this
is
your
beer
drinkability
first
lost
abbey
ive
had
and
thought
this
one
was
a
little
too
straight
forward
expected
something
bigger
that
would
pop
in
your
mouth
more
not
a
bad
entrance
into
this
brewery
and
hoping
to
try
more
of
their
offerings
poured
into
a
chalice
cloudy
peach
gold
colour
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
just
a
bit
of
lace
very
fruity
aroma
yellow
grapes
white
wine
crackers
bread
and
yeast
cloves
and
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
good
balance
bitterness
was
present
throughout
but
remains
restrained
the
fruity
character
so
prominent
in
the
aroma
was
pulled
back
a
bit
and
was
more
of
the
pear
and
apple
variety
allowing
the
malt
to
add
some
smoothness
and
honey
sweetness
spice
and
alcohol
appeared
towards
the
end
and
lingered
into
the
finish
along
with
light
citrus
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
some
dryness
not
bone
dry
like
the
label
warned
nice
texture
this
ones
pretty
drinkable
quite
thirst
quenching
bottle
courtesy
of
bu11zeye
poured
a
deep
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
semisweet
belgianstyle
malt
with
some
light
alcohol
but
no
fruity
ester
as
i
had
expected
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
belgian
malt
with
some
hint
of
alcoholic
phenols
but
no
signs
or
fruity
yeast
ester
or
floral
hops
notes
full
body
with
good
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
showing
i
cant
say
that
this
is
bad
but
it
is
still
somewhat
short
from
duvel
d
abv
very
well
hidden
very
light
and
refreshing
with
nottoosweet
fruit
notes
probably
would
pair
better
with
stronger
or
spicier
food
than
on
its
own
sure
its
drinkable
but
i
would
enjoy
drinking
several
dozen
other
beers
more
i
think
maybe
it
needs
a
food
pairing
instead
of
solo
drinking
d
put
the
750
ml
down
with
no
problem
drinkability
is
beyond
exceptional
balance
duvel
is
the
obvious
inspiration
for
the
this
beer
i
never
tasted
a
beer
that
came
as
close
to
duvels
complexity
and
perfect
balance
highly
recommended
inferno
is
very
fine
belgian
strong
from
tomme
and
the
crew
at
lost
abbey
while
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
it
aint
miles
better
than
the
other
classics
of
the
style
if
you
see
it
you
should
certainly
crack
into
one
d
a
good
bspa
the
flavour
is
tasty
though
overall
i
found
it
kind
of
light
to
style
but
still
enjoyable
the
actual
content
of
the
flavour
profile
makes
it
work
another
good
one
from
lost
abbey
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
moderate
carbonation
is
light
for
style
but
ok
overall
disappointing
some
off
notes
with
some
really
off
blending
tastes
that
dont
work
not
what
i
would
call
a
belgian
strong
ale
at
all
too
much
of
a
california
hops
influence
without
a
lot
of
complexity
d
another
excellent
example
from
this
brewery
although
as
always
watch
your
intake
as
it
doesnt
take
much
to
push
sobriety
another
solid
offering
from
tommee
but
coming
up
short
at
14
per
bottle
really
pretty
straight
forward
nice
notes
of
esters
in
the
nose
some
spice
light
fruits
maybe
a
bit
of
candy
or
bubble
gum
but
the
hops
really
come
through
not
floral
but
rather
stronger
american
hop
notes
of
citrus
nice
tight
fine
carbonation
with
a
lively
head
good
retention
some
bready
malt
notes
that
are
overtaken
by
a
combination
of
phenols
and
hop
bitterness
strong
long
lasting
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
are
right
in
line
and
provide
for
good
drinkability
there
are
many
very
solid
beers
in
this
style
so
its
a
tough
go
a
good
showing
but
not
great
notes
not
bad
by
any
means
but
if
youre
gonna
do
a
clone
make
it
at
least
as
good
and
cheaper
a
nice
attempt
at
a
duvel
clone
i
really
dug
the
prominant
toasted
malt
character
of
this
very
much
tasty
and
easy
drinking
for
the
size
i
would
revisit
this
again
shouldnt
session
this
but
i
definitely
codgreat
stuff
aside
from
the
general
rising
prices
today
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
brew
its
a
nice
slightly
hazy
yellow
belgian
pale
ale
flavor
wise
it
comes
across
soft
with
light
esters
grain
and
honey
notes
its
delivers
a
kick
but
makes
it
a
happy
easy
to
accept
kick
worth
a
try
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
it
pours
a
slightly
fogged
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
dough
and
a
very
minimal
yeasty
funk
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
dough
and
citrus
edge
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
bite
on
the
backside
but
the
flavor
doesnt
stay
that
long
really
whats
there
is
good
though
feel
has
a
full
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
this
is
a
nice
enough
belgian
pale
ale
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
unobtrusive
best
paired
with
food
i
think
drinkability
i
will
be
getting
one
of
these
again
wonderful
output
from
port
brewing
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
lots
of
frothy
white
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
fruit
bread
spices
and
light
grass
tones
tastes
of
apples
and
pears
up
front
followed
by
spices
honey
bread
and
light
barnyard
yeastiness
finishes
with
nice
dry
grass
and
citrus
notes
as
well
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
smooth
bready
with
some
spiciness
and
good
fruit
flavors
just
enough
alcohol
warmth
not
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
out
there
but
a
pretty
nice
attempt
that
i
wont
mind
drinking
again
taste
is
grain
spice
lagerish
some
citrus
finishes
somewhat
dry
this
is
a
wellbalanced
belgian
that
shows
a
good
range
of
phenolproduced
spice
flavors
the
appearance
is
a
mostly
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
head
and
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
bubblrgum
that
the
flavor
lacks
otherwise
the
taste
and
smell
share
a
slew
of
white
and
black
pepper
notes
with
a
touch
of
clove
the
beer
finishes
with
a
bit
of
herbal
slightly
grapefruit
hops
all
in
all
a
tasty
and
spicy
beer
worth
a
try
for
something
a
little
different
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
its
tasty
and
fairly
digestible
overall
im
a
little
underwhelmed
but
since
its
more
expensive
and
much
less
available
then
its
inspiration
theres
really
no
need
for
me
to
bother
with
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
such
a
beer
i
also
think
its
a
bit
rougher
then
duvel
and
reminds
me
that
i
havent
had
one
of
those
in
way
too
long
overall
not
as
spectacular
as
i
had
envisioned
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
my
wife
ended
up
liking
inferno
better
than
i
did
still
worth
a
try
thanks
to
psprings
for
the
bottle
d
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
to
get
some
more
served
in
my
delirium
tremens
tulip
poured
a
hazy
orangegold
with
a
oneinch
foamy
white

with
tiny
ringlet
craters
embedded
in
the
cap
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
consistent
skim
with
some
webs
of
lacing
that
adhere
as
the
volume
of
the
brew
diminishes
scent
of
citrus
belgian
yeast
pepper
and
spice
taste
is
tart
upfront
with
light
fruity
esters
in
the
mix
perhaps
pear
and
melon
a
hint
of
candi
sugar
and
a
hops
presence
detectable
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
tingles
throughout
the

and
a
slightly
tart
finish
that
lingers

quaffs
alcohol

and
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
this
offering
thanks
to
kempleton
and
gford217
for
a
bottle
of
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
swirling
the
glass
leaves
some
nice
webbing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
spices
yeast
and
pepper
up

pear
apple
and
grapes
lightly
tickle
the
nose
as
well
some
honey
and
hops
can
be
detected
too
nice
smelling
brew
taste
begins
with
sweet
citrus
quickly
followed
by
white
bread
and
honey
midway
some
pale
malts
and
dry
hops
emerge
on
the
tongue
with
a
touch
of
booze
aftertaste
is
light
and
fruity
with
a
good
amount
of
grapes
and
banana
leaving
the
mouth
somewhat
dry
medium
body
with
a
soft
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
strong
and
plays
well
into
this
style
of
beer
nothing
about
this
beer
is
too
over
the
top
and
thats
what
i
like
about
it
the
8
5
abv
is
pretty
difficult
to
find
so
be
careful
with
this
one
anoter
chart
topper
for
lost
abbey
keep
em
comin
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
pretty
good
initial
head
that
ultimately
fades
to
a
thin
ring
smells
quite
fruity
with
tropical
fruits
juicy
and
a
bit
sweet
while
maintaining
a
decent
balance
tastes
quite
nice
smooth
and
even
a
bit
waxy
with
some
restrained
fruitiness
some
firm
malt
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
short
sharp
bitterness
that
is
pretty
well
integrated
to
the
overall
taste
very
smooth
and
even
a
touch
soft
in
the
mouth
not
at
all
too
sweet
very
nice
starts
more
like
a
tripel
but
mellows
into
a
more
belgian
pale
taste
as
it
opens
up
drinkability
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
great
for
the
summer
the
alcohol
8
5
is
very
well
hidden
the
hops
used
are
a
little
too
long
lasting
in
the
finish
and
not
my
favorite
varietal
hmmm
hmmmm
what
does
this
taste
like
sweet
sour
bitter
tart
wait
wait
let
me
try
to
convey
the
taste
of
this
amazing
renaissance
man
of
beer
the
inferno
ale
must
just
be
the
greatest
most
diverse
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
keep
taking
sips
from
my
tulip
glass
just
to
make
sure
im
not
going
crazy
this
beer
really
is
sweet
sour
bitter
and
tart
at
the
same
time
wait
a
minute
im
on
sensory
overload
again
i
apologize
but
i
feel
like
the
cop
at
the
end
of
the
usual
suspects
i
just
cant
get
my
head
around
this
beer
theres
definitely
orange
slice
taste
to
this
brew
as
well
as
hop
attack
the
cloudy
color
doesnt
give
you
hints
of
whats
about
to
enter
your
mouth
most
likely
you
havent
tasted
anything
like
this
before
i
dont
mean
just
beer
i
mean
anything
the
alcohol
isnt
too
overpowering
but
you
definitely
know
its
there
like
skeletons
in
your
closet
oh
maybe
i
havent
tried
enough
beer
yet
and
this
is
just
like
puppy
love
and
what
do
i
know
but
this
is
as
real
as
it
gets
from
my
perspective
ill
keep
this
one
as
one
of
the
fondest
memories
ive
ever
had
drinking
a
very
interesting
beer
with
one
of
the
more
complex
flavor
profiles
ive
come
across
while
very
good
i
have
to
say
that
there
are
other
lost
abbey
beers
ive
liked
more
then
this
one
much
like
other
posts
this
was
an
above
average
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
should
be
some
further
development
as
bottle
fermintation
takes
place
over
the
next
couple
years
minerals
some
roasted
banana
leaf
mild
oil
citrus
weird
to
have
a
mineral
taste
as
they
make
their
own
reverse
osmosis
water
and
dont
run
that
water
over
any
type
of
stone
or
rock
to
allow
the
water
to
pick
up
minerals
and
flavor
though
this
beer
still
expresses
minerals
i
do
enjoy
that
flavor
in
this
beer
would
buy
again
but
only
a
couple
for
the
next
couple
years
9
locall
i
believe
so
not
terrible
expensive
yet
another
quality
brew
from
lost
abbey
im
a
big
fan
of
the
duvel
style
belgian
strong
pales
and
this
is
quite
a
good
version
the
fruitiness
is
all
over
the
place
and
i
dig
it
thanks
again
for
the
treat
bill
one
must
learn
to
accept
that
lost
abbey
beers
build
up
a
lot
of
expectation
this
one
was
not
amazing
but
overall
i
find
its
a
good
belgian
pale
and
i
would
try
it
again
lost
abbey
labels
are
really
nice
and
the
artwork
on
this
is
no
exception
i
heard
this
was
similar
to
duvel
which
i
had
for
the
first
time
two
weeks
ago
this
is
a
nice
golden
straw
color
as
the
label
states
the
smell
is
very
hard
for
me
to
describe
but
it
is
nice
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
some
similarities
to
duvel
but
i
think
i
like
this
better
because
it
seems
less
carbonated
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
price
this
seems
more
like
an
8
beer
red
barn
and
such
than
an
11
beer
d
this
is
in
my
top
5
of
favorite
american
crafted
belgianstyle
beers
well
crafted
i
am
ready
to
try
more
this
is
not
my
favorite
lost
abbey
offering
although
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
a
good
brew
but
not
necessarily
my
preference
nice
i
enjoyed
it
and
am
sure
i
will
equally
enjoy
my
next
one
golden
color
with
a
long
lasting
foam
but
it
doesnt
have
the
fun
mountainous
shapes
of
duvel
nose
doesnt
offer
a
lot
up
but
has
a
light
hint
of
fruitiness
flavor
is
similar
to
duvel
but
doesnt
have
quite
the
authenticity
or
depth
a
lot
of
light
fruit
flavors
are
present
i
like
it
pretty
well
well
made
and
a
nice
american
belgian
style
very
refreshing
dangerously
drinkable
a
bit
underrated
glad
i
bought
a
few
as
this
appears
to
be
a
one
time
deal
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
another
lost
abbey
beer
has
made
its
way
to
the
east
coast
this
was
bought
at
martys
liquors
in
newton
today
i
love
the
dante
esq
looking
artwork
on
the
bottle
just
a
side
note
this
was
tasted
as
recommended
by
some
alongside
some
duvel
which
apparently
shares
some
of
the
same
features
pour
in
to
a
sniffer
resulted
in
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
moderately
large
white
head
nose
is
based
in
fruit
with
a
bit
of
a
cinnamon
gum
aroma
must
and
alcohol
similar
to
a
farmhouse
ale
in
some
ways
also
show
themselves
in
the
nose
taste
is
wonderfully
floral
with
spices
all
around
it
transitions
from
sweet
to
tart
to
dry
to
slightly
spicy
within
the
span
of
a
single
sip
body
is
full
but
the
alcohol
is
not
particularly
noticeable
in
the
taste
very
well
hidden
in
fact
this
one
is
easy
to
sip
as
well
but
be
careful
as
it
is
a
decently
strong
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
not
my
favorite
but
still
great
for
those
that
are
wondering
on
the
side
by
side
tasting
duvel
won
by
a
tiny
amount
inferno
is
more
concentrated
on
complex
flavor
and
aroma
whereas
duvel
is
all
about
mastering
the
feel
and
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
putting
the
two
down
against
each
other
as
it
was
a
very
fun
experience
d
a
very
refreshing
brew
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
d
really
good
and
another
great
beer
from
them
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
is
a
belgianstyle
pale
with
emphasis
on
palethe
hops
dominate
the
flavor
with
little
malt
balance
missing
that
great
fluffy
floating
head
that
i
love
so
much
orange
rind
wine
with
an
eye
opener
this
princess
pale
is
into
biting
and
scratching
crispy
youth
sticky
hat
of
a
head
refreshing
every
last
inch
of
my
inebriated
body
shes
my
citrus
honey
bunny
hopping
heavy
royal
imperial
qualities
behind
an
innocent
surrendering
appearance
humble
aromas
and
healthy
light
skin
mask
a
freaky
nature
we
may
never
meet
again
we
may
indulge
every
day
but
i
will
never
be
this
beers
friend
im
gunna
savor
every
last
drop
notes
a
damn
good
summer
thirstquencher
though
itll
get
you
drunk
pretty
quickly
if
youre
not
careful
bonus
points
for
the
awesome
front
and
back
labels
this
is
one
seriously
metal
beer
heavy
metal
that
is
drinkability
coming
in
at
8
5
its
a
powerhouse
of
a
brew
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
hoppy
beers
but
should
be
careful
of
how
much
you
imbibe
the
drinkability
is
amazing
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
in
about
30
minutes
a
great
strong
pale
for
a
85
degree
day
i
will
definitely
be
visiting
lost
abbey
again
very
good
beer
though
i
feel
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
weak
for
a
bspa
drinkability
very
high
id
like
to
line
this
up
against
a
few
of
my
other
favorites
from
this
style
and
then
update
the
reviews
duvel
fin
du
monde
brooklyn
one
and
maybe
mathilda
if
i
have
a
bottle
left
for
the
alchohol
content
this
was
extremely
drinkable
i
wonder
how
this
would
age
drinkability
another
quality
release
from
lost
abbey
the
alcohol
isnt
present
as
many
had
noted
but
i
do
drink
a
lot
of
belgian
beers
honestly
this
is
a
daily
drinker
type
beer
for
me
i
would
age
but
i
see
no
point
the
beer
was
release
in
april
two
months
later
i
wonder
rather
it
piked
or
did
i
just
catch
it
late
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
average
carbonation
for
the
style
aftertaste
is
of
tongue
smacking
dryness
with
a
slightly
bitter
twist
to
it
the
alcohol
to
me
isnt
noticeable
this
one
is
going
down
very
easy
on
this
warm
afternoon
i
dont
think
theres
much
hope
for
three
i
stashed
in
the
cellar
disappointing
considering
all
the
hype
that
this
place
receives
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
bottom
line
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
one
that
id
seek
out
again
highly
recommended
was
hoping
this
was
going
to
be
released
to
the
general
public
after
seeing
it
offered
in
michael
jacksons
rare
beer
club
very
similar
to
duvel
and
even
better
in
some
ways
like
the
hop
profile
more
for
sure
one
of
the
better
belgianstyle
ales
i
have
tasted
lately
would
definitely
drink
again
hope
to
see
some
in
stores
out
here
in
the
inland
empire
recommended
overall
nice
drinking
beer
very
light
in
the
body
which
surprised
me
i
guess
you
could
say
that
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
d
although
this
is
not
as
clamored
about
as
the
other
la
barrelaged
or
blends
or
unique
releases
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
must
try
this
sidebyside
with
duvel
next
time
to
see
which
one
i
prefer
most
cheers
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
nice
beer
it
does
not
have
an
overthetop
inyourface
presence
however
it
is
smooth
somewhat
complex
and
easy
to
drink
it
may
not
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
trappist
ales
but
you
could
do
far
far
worse
than
this
brew
smells
as
rich
as
it
looks
with
some
leather
prune
and
strong
raisin
scent
on
it
taste
follows
the
same
path
with
a
mild
bready
flavor
on
top
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
a
small
yet
soft
and
fluffy
head
not
a
ton
of
complexity
but
certainly
delivers
where
its
needed
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
dutch
take
on
the
trappist
pours
a
murky

one

overall
a

trappist
brew
unusual
offering
from

with
a
yeasty

taste
decent
beer
but
not
really
one
for
me
almost
juicy
banana
along
with
cane
sugar
and
a
subtle
hop
dryness
including
dough
wheat
which
blends
well
into
the
malty
body
of
the
beer
the
hops
compliment
to
the
sweeter
body
of
the
beer
not
only
by
adding
balancing
bitterness
but
also
by
giving
the
malts
a
bready
characteristic
including
a
somehow
chewy
aspect
to
the
otherwise
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
noteable
lively
carbonation
which
brings
out
honey
and
raisins
this
gets
accompanied
by
a
supportive
bitterness
which
leaves
the
palate
a
little
earlier
than
the
malts
do
isidor
pours
a
welcoming
shade

white
sitting
on
top
the
brew
is
somewhat
murky
and
more
than
adequately
carbonated
from
the
nose
i
am
picking
up
lots
of
fruit
esters
primarily
plum
apple
cinnamon
some
phenols
and
a
bready
malt
character
the
initial
wave
of
flavor
reveals
a
big
molasses
taste
with
fig
moving
onward
to
a
very
spicy
alcoholladen
ending
and
a
fair
amount
of
sharp
hops
the
finish
is
smooth
however
leaving
a
very
wholesome
grainy
flavor
on
your
tastebuds
overall
very
good
but
could
use
some
improvement
in
the
balance
department
the
body
is
medium
for
such
a
big
beer
and
the
very
fine
soft
carbonation
gives
it
an
extraordinary
creaminess
overall
its
a
nice
sipper
i
really
like
this
oaky
character
overall
this
is
a
very
good
bpa
although
it
fall
a
bit
short
of
being
outstanding
i
love
the
fruitiness
but
the
malt
could
be
turned
up
a
bit
all
in
all
though
a
good
beer
not
bad
though
its
pretty
obvious
that
ive
held
onto
this
bottle
for
too
long
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
reminiscent
of
fruity
yeast
notes
and
sherry
somewhat
oxidised
and
with
little
bitterness
body
is
ok
goes
down
alright
but
i
reckon
this
is
overly
oxidised
and
not
as
the
brewer
intended
i
may
rereview
in
the
future
if
i
have
the
chance
worth
sampling

you

a

enjoyable
offering
p
s
this
is
my
subjective
opinion
the
price
is
right
on
this
one
as
it
was
one
of
the
cheaper
trappist
beer
selections
but
is
not
cheap
on
taste
would
certainly
try
this
one
again
overall
a
very
sweet
beer
with
lots
of
dried
cherryfruit
notes
toasty
caramel
and
brown
sugarish
malts
very
carbonated
and
warming
nothing
to
really
go
out
of
your
way
for

a

across
as
reminiscent
of
a

fairly
easy
drinking
a
lot
of
heftiness
and
flavor
coming
at
you
however
without
being
bold
a
sturdy
belgian
golden
ale
with
a
darker
side
overall
drinkability
definitely
better
as
it
warms
up
as
when
first
poured
and
cold
i
wasnt
that
impressed
that
being
said
i
always
feel
like
im
missing
something
when
i
put
a
trappist
ale
in
a
chalice
that
im
not
concentrating
all
the
complex
flavors
properly
and
im
missing
something
however
this
could
be
the
point
the
monks
just
want
me
to
drink
it
and
not
obsess
over
it
its
just
beer
that
they
made
for
charitable
activities
or
maybe
it
is
more
of
a
visual
wow
that
theyre
looking
for
look
at
that
glass
now
look
at
what
is
in
it
so
heres
my
conclusion
great
packaging
but
the
inside
contents
are
just
good
not
great
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
bigger
glass
but
im
okay
with
the
fact
that
i
just
have
a
11
2oz
as
well
so
overall
i
think
above
average
but
not
hugely
so
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
there
are
better
examples
out
there
overall
an
alright
beer
not
one
im
likely
to
rush
out
to
buy
again
but
i
might
have
it
again
depending
on
the
other
options
i
had
available
to
me
i
can
see
this
one
being
appealing
to
those
who
like
dubbels
or
other
belgian
dark
ales
as
it
seems
to
skirt
the
line
between
styles
a
little
bit
to
me
not
as
much
on
the
dark
fruits
but
the
overall
profile
is
definitely
different
from
many
of
the
topnotch
bspas
ive
sampled
ogood
flavors
and
enjoyable
sipping
nice
to
drink
during
the
holidays
the
taste
tends
to
have
a
higher
bitterness
than
the
aroma
might
suggest
there
are
upfront
belgian
malts
and
pear
or
other
fruit
along
with
a
moderate
lingering
after
taste
it
has
its
redeeming
qualities
a
birthday
beer
for
me
on
tap
at
brass
tap
gainesville
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
small
creamy
head
aroma
of
plums
and
figs
candy
sugar
and
a
bit
of
yeast
flavor
is
big
plums
and
more
plums
wow
straight
up
fruit
flavor
here
with
some
candy
sugar
sweetness
easy
drinking
with
medium
mouthfeel
excellent
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
barrel
aged
version
medium
body
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
full
bitterness
on
the
midpalate
and
finish
balance
the
richness
in
the
beer
nice
long
finish
overall
this
is
nice
im
not
really
familiar
with
the
style
and
it
was
a
nice
nightcap
need
to
let
it
warm
to
bring
out
sweetness
good
could
be
more
complex
a
smooth
drink
though
da
very
solid
example
of
the
style
nicely
sweet
but
not
overdone
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
you
should
have
one
overall
a
rather
nice
tasty
and
drier
belgian
strong
with
just
the
right
level
of
hop
to
compliment
the
flavors
of
the
brew
rather
easy
drinking
and
a
good
brew
to
try
o
better
than
the
oak
aged
might
be
due
to
differences
in
age
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
this
gang
of
monks
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
banana
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
smells
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
pours
a
cloudy
dark
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
alcohol
slight
spice
slight
grass
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
hops
slight
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
decent
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
overall
hard
beer
to
find
but
well
worth
it
a
bit
dry
and
dominated
by
brisk
carbonation
this
bspa
tends
to
maintain
the
basic
characteristics
of
any
of
the
other
la
trappe
ales
ive
sampled
so
far
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
there
are
really
no
faults
to
be
found
here
yet
held
up
against
other
offerings
of
this
style
it
does
not
really
stand
out
from
its
peers
to
put
it
bluntly
from
my
snobby
opinion
this
is
a
wellcrafted
ale
for
the
style
but
at
the
same
time
isnt
very
memorable
either
chalk
it
up
to
an
embarrassment
of
riches
when
it
comes
to
selection
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
thick
biege
colored
head
that
dissipates
slowly
there
are
some
visible
streaming
bubbles
that
can
be
seen
along
the
side
of
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
as
the
head
retreats
the
beer
smells
pretty
malty
with
some
mild
sweetness
and
fruit
but
the
aroma
is
not
strong
the
flavor
is
of
malt
light
toffee
and
banana
some
flavors
of
clove
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
but
the
drinkability
is
high
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
descent
beer
flavor
is
solid
but
not
heavy
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
i
enjoy
it
but
i
would
not
pay

for
the
11
2

i
would
order

a
bit
lighter
in
taste
intensity
compared
to
other
belgian
pales
but
very
pleasant
and
well
made
o
nice
love
the
bottle
which
feels
like
a
work
of
art
from
a
european
gallery
and
love
that
its
trappist
feels
like
a
more
watery
version
of
a
rochefort
6
still
love
its
authenticity
and
uniquenss
would
go
well
with
spicy
puddings
and
mild
to
medium
strong
cheeses
this
brew
has
surpassed
a
lot
of
the
belgians
that
i
have
tried
in
the
past
its
super
complex
tasty
and
the
flavors
really
mesh
to
create
a
balanced
and
complex
brew
oi
dont
know
exactly
what
i
would
call
this
style
but
it
is
belgian
and
it
is
amazing
it
is
such
a
wonderful
flavor
fairly
complex
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
it
is
so
tasty
i
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
likes
belgians
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
hazy
golden
pour
very
fizzy
on
the
pour
it
settles
down
slight
head
no
lacing
lots
of
phenols
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
overpowered
by
the
phenols
some
alcohol
lingering
alcohol
on
finish
the
body
is
medium
light
carbonation
imo
an
underwhelming
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
other
belgians
o
a
tasty
belgian
ale
the
pale
ale
aspects
are
a
little
subdued
for
my
liking
but
a
solid
brew
none
the
less
that
i
am
glad
i
came
across
o
pretty
good
strong
ale
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
335
ml
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
really
really
good
brew
the
worst
part
about
it
is
finishing
it
i
will
definitely
another
when
i
see
it
again
salud
but
whe
is
drinkable
crispy
and
pleasant
hats
off
the
fellows
add
lasses
who
make
such
stuff
of
angels
this
isnt
so
bad
that
it
isnt
worth
finishing
in
some
respects
the
flavors
pulled
together
later
on
in
the
glass
regardless
this
is
hardly
worth
4

a
pop
for
a
special
anniversary
offering
isidor
lacks
the
twinkle
in
its
eye
still
de
koningshoeven
found
a
nice
middle
ground
between
elegance
and
playfulness
read
easy
casual
drinking
its
effervescent
enough
to
make
a
good
5
oclock
boost
but
works
just
as
well
as
a
late
evening
wind
down
a
largesize
bottle
of
the
stuff
is
better
than
a
day
at
the
spa
id
be
happy
to
finish
all
my
stressful
evenings
off
with
it
one
of
the
better
bspas
that
i
have
encountered
of
late
and
thats
with
the
big
sugary
nature
that
just
wont
quit
the
subtly
of
the
trappist
name
may
be
a
tad
challenged
here
but
it
still
passes
quite
easily
the
yeast
and
fruit
seemingly
calling
in
favours
to
do
so
this
is
a
nice
brew
gentle
carbonated
but
not
too
balanced
but
sweet
it
doesnt
make
magic
the
way
the
quad
that
was
in
the
set
does
but
it
holds
up
as
a
very
good
brew
its
a
solid
example
of
a
bubblegum
belgian
brew
the
yeast
is
the
main
attraction
in
isidor
very
easy
drinking
and
mellow
and
quite
tasty
o
a
tasty
belgian
solid
flavour
profile
and
easily
drinkable
the
abv
is
dangerously
subtle
and
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
worth
a
try
and
i
might
buy
this
again
candisugar
sweetness
also
was
on
display
in
the
flavor
additionally
there
was
some
caramel
and
toffee
making
it
to
me
a
bit
dubbelish
i
also
detected
some
subtle
hints
of
raisiny
dark
fruit

all
in
all
thnx

pours
a
fairly
clear

and
a

of
alcohol
along
with
a
tiny

fair

again
lightly

medfull

really

here
something
i
could
easily
revist
and
probably
will
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
really
what
id
expect
from
a
brewery
like
la
trappe
itd
be
really
great
if
found
at
a
nice
local
brewpub
but
the
taste
is
a
little
too
watery
to
be
outstanding
despite
its
excellent
execution
of
its
apparence
and
mouthfeel
3

overall

this
beer
is
a
wonderful
abbey
ale
and
has
so
many
subtle
differences
from
any
other
abbey
ale
you
may
have
had
previously
the
color
alone
is
unique
and
worth
buying
the
beer
just
to
see
it
in
your
glass
the
taste
is
excellent
and
is
representative
of
the
product
of
generations
of
master
abbey
brewers
men
who
have
nothing
else
to
do
other
than
perfect
their
beers
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
well
worth
tracking
down
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
at
all
a
nice
well
rounded
and
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
cream
of
the
crop
as
far
as
trappists
go
but
very
close
ill
buy
more
if
this
were
not
a
trappist
product
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
very
highly
simply
because
of
that
strong
sweet
taste
up
front
however
as
it
is
special
in
the
regard
that
it
is
a
trappist
beer
then
i
would
not
pass
this
up
if
you
can
find
it
o
easily
drinkable
a
touch
to
sweet
imo
none
the
less
very
enjoyable

the
beer
is
of
high

and

not
likely
to
ever
get

of
this

is

notes
of

along
with

the
taste
is

picked
this

just

with
hints

mouthfeel
is
medium

very
smooth
with
just
slightly
chewy

syrupy
i
tasted
the
oak
aged
version
of
this
first
and
really
thought
id
be
let
down
with
this
version
since
the
oaked
was
so
amazing
but
this
one
holds
its
own
and
its
one
of
those
beers
that
just
screams
to
be
put
in
a
barrel
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
both
of

incredible

into

d
pretty
good
and
one
that
i
would
have
again
flows
easily
with
food
or
conversation
this
is
just
a
great
beer
overall
a
solid
belgian
ale
reminds
me
of
a
dubbel
but
not
as
strong
a
malty
treat
that
i
can
recommend
o
very
good
overall
love
the
tart
finish
and
huge
sweet
fruits
overall
sort
of
an
unusual
beer
the
apple
flavour
really
sticks
out
i
could
see
some
people
being
really
into
this
beer
i
like
it
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
be
in
the
mood
for
all
that
often
o
very
nice
belgian
style
beer
though
i
cant
help
but
think
this
is
misclassified
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
toned
down
la
trappe
quad
which
i
guess
makes
sense
is
that
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
more
drinkable
due
to
lower
abv
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
quite
good
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
unique
aroma
and
taste
components
the
esters
were
huge
and
contrasted
nicely
with
the
synthetic
chemically
phenols
this
beer
is
belgian
through
and
through
but
the
finish
was
a
bit
souring
for
our
liking
it
isnt
entirely
overpowering
but
some
persistence
of
some
of
the
softer
flavors
would
have
helped
balanced
this
beer
in
the
end
notes
a
very
well
rounded
beer
and
a
solid
amount
of
sweetness
all
the
way
through
cheers
overall
a
well
made
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
having
again
nice
balanced
and
nothing
is
overdone
recommended
this
isnt
the
best
la
trappe
brew
but
that
said
its
still
superior
to
many
many
others
in
this
genre
pours
a
not
fully
clear
glowing
red
color
with
a
lovely
belgian
head
into
a
leffe
thick
stem
goblet
smell
is
very
sweet
malty
and
alcoholic
taste
is
quite
tart
and
way
less
sugary
than
the
nose
would
suggest
a
hop
crispness
washes
over
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
delicate
fizz
on
the
tongue
belgian
yeast
notes
trickle
in
and
so
does
the
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
chewing
this
flavor
for
awhile
now
nice
mouthfeel
to
be
expected
in
these
beers
bright
and
clean
it
aint
the
quad
but
its
delicious
not
my
type
of
beer
but
not
bad
very
nice
beer
thebeeralmanac
com
cheers
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
but
an
interesting
beer
and
imo
a
different
spin
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
than
ive
had
before
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
just
doesnt
move
one
way
or
another
for
flavor
it
is
also
a
bit
too
alcoholic
for
the
subtle
flavors
therein
still
it
has
that
great
belgian
yeast
character
easy
enough
to
drink
do
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
certainly
repeatable
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
full
of
flavor
and
pretty
nicely
balanced
definitely
impressed
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
pales
out
there
though
a
little
high
gravity
for
the
style
its
very
tasty
and
crisp
an
allaround
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
15
for
a
4pack
o
this
beer
wants
to
be
a
popstar
but
it
isnt
o
very
good
love
everything
konigshoven
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
just
damn
good
beer
d
nice
for
sampling
from
the
11
2
ounce
size
good
for
the
now
and
then
dip
into
the
naturally
sweeter
belgians
pours
an
ambercaramel
color
with
a
great
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
light
fruit
and
some
caramel
a
bit
of
bread
crust
the
flavor
adds
in
a
fair
amount
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
light
bitterness
nothing
spectacular
d
i
dont
really
know
what
to
think
about
this
one
it
isnt
much
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
seems
more
like
an
amberto
me
the
sugary
malt
is
dominant
and
it
really
pages
out
any
yeast
and
hop
character
drinkable
but
not
real
exciting
o
this
is
a
heavy
beer
i
like
the
flavor
changes
but
the
fruity
ness
was
more
on
the
semi
sweet
side
overall
drinkability
great
beer
would
have
again
this
brew
had
caught
my
eye
at
my
local
shop
the
one
day
i
was
there
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
one
because
i
like
mostly
everything
that
la
trappe
puts
out
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
murky
orange
color
the
head
was
decent
but
didnt
lace
the
glass
all
that
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
but
had
more
of
a
yeasty
malt
aroma
to
it
the
flavor
has
some
breadlike
qualities
with
some
light
herbal
notes
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
sooth
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
belgian
pale
ale
some
nice
maltsweet
character
and
a
decent
toastherb
finish
o
pretty
good
belgian
pale
ale
it
was
easily
drinkable
well
balanced
and
had
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
worth
price
and
would
have
it
again
i
must
confess
i
havent
had
the
original
isidor
but
the
oak
aged
version
is
very
good
a
delicate
caramel
aroma
matches
the
amber
transparency
which
leans
gold
an
effervescent
head
lightly
flows
to
the
surface
flavors
are
abundant
starting
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
lingering
into
a
smooth
caramel
mid
with
intricate
notes
of
oak
in
the
back
and
finishes
with
a
complex
dark
red
fruit
combination
reminding
me
somewhat
of
raspberries
it
might
just
be
worth
the
25
price
tag
but
a
4
pack
of
rochefort
10
may
have
been
more
satisfying
for
a
similar
price
overall
i
rate
this
a
low
4
doesnt
compete
with
the
big
boys
from
belgium
an
enjoyable
brew
and
done
well
a
tasty
belgian
if
not
a
big
bold
one
the
first
beer
in
my
quiet
saturday
night
in
4th
june
2011
decent
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
this
reminds
me
why
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
belgian
styles
still
worth
a
pour
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
tart
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
dry
finish
a
nice
brew
thats
satisfying
but
kind
of
falls
a
little
flat
in
the
long
run
tasty
and
one
id
try
again
but
it
is
a
little
expensive
at
4
a
bottle
ouch
so
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
buy
another
very
drinkable
each
sip
has
that
surprising
sharp
fruitiness
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
long
mellow
aftertaste
ill
look
for
this
on
tap
od
nice
but
weaker
in
all
things
i
expected
good
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
they
could
have
put
a
little
more
into
this
it
seemed
mild
for
the
abv
poured
dark
burnt
sienna
with
a
nice
finger
of
white
head
that
retained
well
smell
of
light
fruit
and
citrus
tastes
of
rich
caramel
light
spice
light
and
dark
fruits
pears
cantaloupes
raisins
plums
smooth
and
light
and
nearly
perfect
to
my
palate
medium
body
and
some
carbonation
highly
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
m
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
that
tricks
you
into
thinking
it
is
thicker
than
it
actually
is
possibly
fermented
a
little
hot
as
there
is
a
slight
nail
polish
flavor
overall
its
very
pleasant
but
the
flavor
is
not
quite
able
to
match
the
great
aroma
d
good
beer
not
the
most
unique
in
fact
im
not
sure
that
i
could
pick
it
out
from
a
crowd
trappist
beers
but
that
shouldnt
detract
from
its
drinkability
its
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
which
counts
for
a
lot
overall
very
pleasant
trappist
second
only
to
orval
cloy
and
sweet
rich
thick
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
prevent
the
beer
from
being
syrupy
the
malt
flavor
is
strong
enough
to
cover
the
alcohol
which
is
lightly
evident
theres
a
moderate
bite
of
the
belgian
yeast
with
the
exception
of
the
nearly
nonexistent
hop
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
a
staple
abbey
from
a
staple
abbey
every
beer
ive
had
is
rather
good
but
i
would
like
to
state
that
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
better
on
the
european
side
of
the
water
as
quality
goes
this
one
was
spot
on
la
trappe
pour
is
murky
dark
apple
with
a
small
but
thick
head
nose
of
belgian
yeast
plum
and
apple
pie
the
palate
with
a
nice
sweet
toffee
and
almonds
and
clove
not
as
malty
in
my
recollect
as
the
dubbel
quite
an
average
beer
to
be
honest
no
huge
flaws
but
nothing
worth
praises
a
really
nice
trappist
d
easy
to
drink
moreso
than
others
ive
tried
in
the
style
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
this
one
again
but
its
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
to
use
as
an
introduction
to
belgian
brews
for
a
craft
newbie
d
i
think
ill
buy
a
sixpack
and
keep
it
for
special
occasions
i
graded
drinkability
5
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
one
after
another
i
dont
even
want
to
keep
it
exceptional
wine
glass
brought
to
the
table
hmmm
well
wine
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
an
amber
colored
ale
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
hides
quickly
fruity
aroma
central
pears
grapes
and
apples
to
name
a
few
a
lot
going
on
here
as
fruity
as
it
smells
the
taste
comes
at
me
with
a
bitter
smack
to
the
palate
followed
with
a
light
floral
swallow
lingering
dark
fruit
aftertaste
awesome
dry
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
at
7
5
this
drank
very
smoothly
though
i
drank
it
slow
to
savor
each
and
every
sip
you
should
too
great
beer
a
great
find
ive
never
seen
this
one
before
and
glad
i
got
it
i
look
foward
to
the
quad
tommorrow
its
remarkably
drinkable
and
the
more
it
warms
the
more
velvety
and
supple
it
becomes
both
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
in
flavor
its
a
charming
delicately
complex
and
sweetish
sipper
its
almost
sherrylike
in
a
way
but
not
as
rich
or
full
if
i
were
to
pair
it
with
food
id
stay
on
the
lighter
side
soft
cheeses
with
chewy
bread
moules
in
white
sauce
with
a
hint
of
anise
sweet
potatoes
fried
roast
pork
carrot
soup
you
get
the
picture
well
worth
trying
before
its
gone
very
drinkable
just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
good
stuff
just
like
all
la
trappe
beers
give
it
a
try
d
drinks
really
good
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
would
buy
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
is
enjoyable
solid
drinkabilty
has
just
enough
alcohol
to
keep
it
from
getting
any
higher
drinkabilty
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
love
the
sweet
fruits
and
tart
yeast
really
good
not
world
class
but
glad
i
tried
it
out
not
sure
i
would
have
more
than
one
a
well
made
beer
i
think
with
lots
of
nice
lacing
with
a
dry
finish
the
beer
feels
very
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
part
of
a
gift
pack
with
a
gold
rimmed
glass
a
hazed
amber
with
a
sizable
off
white
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
belgian
fruitiness
banana
and
funk
predominate
light
sweet
malt
and
a
floral
hop
presence
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
carmel
sweetness
and
mild
but
firm
bitterness
nice
fruitiness
running
from
banana
to
light
fresh
figs
a
touch
of
pear
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
cork
feel
is
velvety
and
full
more
like
a
quad
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
almost
creamy
quite
drinkable
even
though
the
glass
feel
and
taste
encourage
sipping
you
just
dont
want
to
rush
this
one
yum
d
different
pale
ale
to
me
vanilla
is
interesting
and
quite
different
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
obvious
as
well
not
so
sure
i
would
do
more
than
one
at
a
time
with
this
i
like
the
differences
as
opposed
to
a
us
style
pale
ale
but
it
is
better
colder
than
warmer
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
better
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
would
drink
again
though
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
pleasant
but
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
spice
and
alcohol
at
the
end
not
bad
but
not
entirely
interesting
wholesome
as
liquid
bread
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
would
pair
nicely
with
roast
beef
or
a
thick
slab
of
prime
rib
and
roast
potatoes
drinkability
not
my
favorite
trappist
ale
but
id
take
this
beer
over
a
large
majority
of
everything
else
thats
out
there
this
brew
pours
a
orange
bread
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
creamyvelvety
looking
head
with
a
nice
rim
of
lacing
aswellthe
smell
is
very
bready
with
also
strong
hints
of
carameltoffee
and
dried
fruitsit
has
a
nice
creamy
over
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
the
has
rich
tastes
of
breadtoffee
lots
of
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
nice
caramelized
fig
like
sweet
finish
and
overall
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
but
if
your
not
into
a
sweet
amber
ale
then
this
would
not
be
for
you
but
for
me
quite
enjoyable
appears
an
amber
semid
clouded
crust
of

with
a

in

trappist
brewery
flavors
slightly
bitter
roasted

with
a

mix
of

caramelized
appleraisins
with
a
slightly
nutty
spiced
edge
from
the
yeast
effervescent
carbonation
kicks
the

across
the

nicely
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
made
for
sipping
on
glad
i
grabbed
a
gift
pack
with
two
bottles
of
isidor
and
quad
with
an
official
glass
d
this
is
my
favourite
la
trappe
beer
and
is
recommended
this
is
a
nice
belgianstyle
beer
with
substance
and
caramel
malt
flavor
equal
noble
hop
character
and
a
subtle
belgian
yeast
hint
sneaks
in
a
nice
find
worth
a
try
if
you
prefer
more
mellow
belgianyeast
character
d
so
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
the
abv
actually
pretty
refreshing
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
smallish
white
head
that
laces
ok
nose
is
largely
bready
malt
on
top
of
some
yeastiness
simple
but
not
bad
by
any
means
flavor
is
similarly
simple
bready
and
yeasty
witha
bit
of
depth
added
from
some
light
fruity
notespears
maybe
some
apple
moderate
mouthfeel
wellcarbonated
decent
drink
sometimes
the
booze
shines
through
a
bit
not
a
bad
beer
overall
though
not
something
id
grab
on
a
regular
basis
hv
copper
pour
with
a
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
toffee
tree
fruits
bubblegum
dry
spices
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
dry
and
relatively
clean
with
very
mild
belgian
esters
some
subtly
sweet
bread
and
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
nutty
tree
fruits
on
the
finish
dry
medium
body
wit
lots
of
carbonation
in
all
a
thumbs
up
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
certain
to
buy
more
if
i
can
find
it
not
too
inspiring
but
definitely
a
solid
brew
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
flavor
has
a
nice
caramel
malty
sweetness
with
some
fruit
yeast
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
fine
but
im
not
sure
that
id
have
two
in
a
row
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
la
trappe
drinkability
fabulous
belgian
ale
overall
a
good
bpa
but
not
something
that
ill
remember
tomorrow
just
now
available
here
in
tx
rotation
not
memorable
enough
to
make
the
rotation
also
its
pricey
so
hurt
by
that
nn
d
smooth
but
becoming
bitter
towards
the
end
which
may
be
slightly
offputting
quite
pleasant
to
drink
though
a
solid
strong
belgian
pale
good
flavour
all
around
and
not
overbearing
in
any
way
d
great
i
could
drink
more
i
might
have
rated
it
a
bit
highter
but
you
can
pick
up
on
the
booziness
a
bit
more
than
id
expect
but
if
you
like
trappists
other
koningshoeven
brews
youll
probably
like
this
or
at
least
feel
its
worth
trying
poured
into
a
koningshaeven
chalice
a
opaque
burnt
orange
almost
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
the
scent
has
strong
raisin
and
grapefruit
notes
the
alcohol
scent
is
actually
detected
in
the
scent
the
taste
is
rather
bready
with
some
rasin
flavors
mixed
in
not
much
of
a
hop
bitterness
that
i
can
tell
overall
this
is
an
ok
belgian
but
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
pale
ale
high
drinkability
overall
very
good
od
not
bad
at
all
but
a
disappointment
overall
im
wishing
i
had
tried
one
fresh
first
in
order
to
have
a
comparison
with
my
cellared
version
just
try
the
beer
if
you
can
find
it
and
dont
share
it
with
any
food
while
i
can
think
of
a
great
many
cheeses
desserts
and
mains
that
would
work
very
well
with
this
beer
i
would
argue
that
it
is
meant
to
be
savored
as
a
meal
itself
drinkability
good
beer
and
sessionable
but
maybe
just
a
little
too
sweet
flavor
is
big
and
fruity
with
bananas
sweet
bread
and
clove
leading
the
charge
hops
are
faded
but
show
up
in
the
finish
to
contribute
a
detectable
bitterness
that
lingers
well
nice
balance
of
spices
and
sweetness
but
this
beer
does
become
slightly
cloying
after
a
while
creamyslick
consistency
to
the
medium
body
with
a
bubbly
carbonation
level
that
perks
up
the
tongue
and
allows
the
underlying
complexity
to
really
take
hold
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
but
it
ultimately
works
a
great
trappiste
ale
could
fool
even
the
most
seasoned
belgian
beer
drinkers
not
bad
but
i
think
we
have
come
to
expect
more
from
trappist
brewers
with
all
the
complexity
and
balance
displayed
here
i
keep
looking
for
those
finite
intangibles
that
make
this
beer
premiere
but
in
the
end
there
are
none
its
only
a
good
beer
somewhat
of
a
let
down
in
the
trappist
world
d
very
good
beer
but
lots
of
better
belgian
pale
ales
to
choose
from
the
alc
is
also
a
bit
in
your
face
instead
of
chilled
back
in
the
mix
for
my
tastes
drinkability
very
good
all
the
elements
are
balanced
well
this
is
one
you
want
to
drink
all
night
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sugary
small
gingerbread
like
maltiness
actually
quite
mellow
in
the
taste
a
gingerbread
maltiness
and
a
sugary
balance
to
it
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malt
and
small
sugar
hints
in
the
aftertaste
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
this
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
theres
a
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
a
somewhat
unique
one
that
has
a
bit
different
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
characteristic
than
your
standard
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
next
time
when
i
am
there
in
a
bigger
glass
this
beer
tastes
good
i
would
seek
it
out
again
d
good
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
other
trappists
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
bland
or
mundane
with
the
apple
flavors
the
only
thing
that
stands
out
only
my
second
beer
from
the
la
trappe
family
but
isidor
unilke
the
quad
will
bring
me
back
to
try
other
products
of
the
family
recommended
md
alcohol
noticeable
a
bit
down
on
carbonation
not
enough
in
there
to
drink
it
often
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
refreshing
it
is
because
of
the
active
carbonation
making
it
well
drinkable
nice
no
holds
barred
belgian
complex
ale
d
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
taste
is
good
but
the
overcarbonation
makes
it
a
one
and
done
for
me
quite
downable
for
all
its
sharp
edges
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
think
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
koningshoeven
actually
gets
rather
tiresome
after
a
while
the
phenolic
bitterness
is
overwhelming
when
its
concerted
and
i
feel
the
heat
in
the
body
a
little
too
much
yeasty
complexity
of
a
top
notch
biere
de
garde
most
of
what
comes
through
in
the
nose
is
present
in
the
flavor
profile
particularly
the
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
d
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
this
one
would
make
a
great
start
for
those
new
to
belgians
overall
best
belgian
style
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
even
though
it
is
from
the
netherlands
awesome
must
have
beer
for
any
beer
geek
no
question
i
rested
this
foaming
gusher
for
a
week
in
my
cellar
obtained
from
premiere
gourmet
tolerable
yeasty
aromas
from
the
surving
majority
of
the
bottle
beige
coloured
body
and
abundant
bubbly
head
aboveaverage
mouthfeel
although
alcohol
stung
my
parched
lips
satisfying
though
still
drying
finish
a
little
cooca
and
vanilla
in
the
yeast
nothing
complicated
she
is
about
right
for
the
style
me
thinks
overall
a
solid
trappist
beer
but
not
really
an
award
winner
still
i
would
be
glad
to
drink
it
anytime
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
dont
like
the
cork
stuff
in
wine
nor
beer
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
with
a
bottle
holding
a
non
moldy
cork
la
trappe
imho
is
the
less
good
trappist
however
still
a
quite
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
belgian
yeast
with
some
fruit
wheat
and
bubblegum
very
nice
smelling
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
the
bubblegum
and
fruit
being
fairly
strong
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
classic
trappist
brew
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
massive
flavor
while
maintaining
solid
drinkability
and
authentic
trappist
character
a
great
example
of
trappist
brewing
and
a
fine
beer
very
enjoyable
d
i
liked
this
effort
sort
of
a
trappist
session
beer
and
more
of
a
dubbelchimay
red
type
brew
instead
of
a
bpa
in
fact
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
that
beer
taste
is
nice
and
dry
very
smooth
and
crisp
really
sharp
an
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
despite
the
fact
that
i
wasnt
really
expecting
too
much
from
it
to
begin
with
it
might
really
benefit
from
some
age
which
would
hopefully
diminish
the
metallic
note
this
isnt
overly
complex
either
and
i
truthfully
dont
know
if
age
will
really
improve
this
much
but
it
will
change
it
very
good
but
not
great
conclusion
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
tasty
belgian
just
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
trappist
brewery
brewing
a
specialedition
beer
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
hazed
lighter
amber
shade
with
some
burnt
orange
tinge
to
ita
large
fluffy
white
crown
atop
that
left
broken
chunks
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
slowly
bubble
gum
was
the
main
thing
i
got
in
the
nosea
bit
of
phenolic
spice
as
well
flavors
are
decent
but
one
dimensional
in
the
medicinal
hopand
bubble
gum
notesthere
is
a
some
caramel
malt
and
pearlike
flavors
that
come
in
but
they
dont
compete
with
the
medicinal
qualities
its
a
good
beer
not
worth
11
99but
not
greatsomeone
who
like
belgian
hops
and
phenols
would
be
more
inclined
to
like
this
beer
very
tasty
belgian
pale
certainly
one
of
the
better
ive
had
very
well
balanced
and
alcohol
well
hidden
the
first
beer
of
koningshoeven
i
have
tried
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
m
medium
to
fullbodied
this
beer
is
a
stepping
stone
to
trappist
ales
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
flaavorful
from
start
ro
finish
its
a
very
good
beer
d
i
tried
this
last
week
and
maxs
and
wasnt
impressed
that
must
have
been
alcohol
fatigue
because
i
really
am
enjoying
this
bottle
my
first
sample
of
this
dutch
companys
offerings
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
a
good
brew
that
id
be
willing
to
revisit
d
goes
down
smooth
the
concept
of
fusel
alcohols
make
me
consider
the
prospect
of
a
headache
to
come
had
this
beer
ontap
at
a
2
amys
pizza
restaurant
in
dc
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
they
had
such
a
great
brew
available
and
it
was
only
7glass
the
appearance
was
a
nice
caramel
color
with
redishpink
undertones
the
taste
was
excellent
lots
of
juicy
fruit
bread
and
sugar
the
main
flavor
that
kept
coming
through
for
me
was
cherry
i
would
have
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
cherry
beer
if
i
didnt
know
otherwise
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
belgian
pale
d
very
nice
drinkability
the

is
nicely
hidden
behind
a
luscious
malty
body
that
makes
this
go
down
with
much
ease
and
delight
you
can
hardly
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
product
cheers
a
dessert
beer
and
a
real
treat
d
very

beer
the
abv
isnt

high
and
the
flvaors
are
just
right
taste
is
bready

with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
a
surprisingly
high
amount
of
alcohol
for
a
meager
7

ale
caramely
malt
with
a
definite
candi
sugar
flavor
a
touch
of
toasty
malt
and
a
kiss
of
hops
give
it
a
little
bit
of
bittering
on
the
finish
body
is
a
bit
thin
it
just
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
heft
to
it
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
trappist
beers
perhaps
the
dutch
cannot
quite
hang
with
the
monks
from
belgium
opinion
well
obviously
i
really
liked
this
beer
if
it
truly
is
a
belgian
pale
some
pear
and
fig
in
there
with
some
light
fruit
but
it
misses
that
bite
that
i
like
in
belgian
golds
finishes
light
like
a
decent
american
pale
ale
overall
a
solid
brew

thanks
ruckusdu
for
the
opportunity
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
was
again
the
balance
is
a
little
weird
in
the
taste
definitely
an
improvement
on
a
pretty
boring
beer
fat
tire
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
but
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
if
it
popped
up
and
my
pocketbook
was
feeling
heavier
than
normal
i
dont
think
id
really
like
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
so
grab
a
22
oz
and
share
it
with
a
friend
well
made
but
not

you

no

orange
and
golden
body
with
some
lacing
aroma
of
juniper
fresh
flowers
orange
peel
belgian
yeast
and
some
candy
sugar
well
the
flavor
is
a
little
sour
up
front
but
smooths
out
quickly
and
finishes
slight
tart
and
mildly
sweet
the
one
tastes
like
one
of

juices
very
tropical
with

pineapple
and
tangerine
with
some
peach
belgian
character
is
understated
medium
to
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
pretty
unidimensional
and
hardly
belgian
this
series
has
disappointed
me
again
d
flabby
and
muddy
the
yeast
character
is
pungent
but
not
particularly
good
there
is
both
a
lack
of
crispness
and
a
somewhat
harsh
bittering
component
to
this
beer
im
not
sure
quite
what
they
were
hoping
for
here
but
they
dont
seem
to
have
pulled
it
off
o
overall
i
appreciate
this
for
it
uniqueness
but
its
just
ok
for
me
i
would
definitely
recommend
letting
it
warm
a
bit
before
drinking
overall
ok
but
not
great
decent
flavors
that
seemed
to
have
gone
a
bit
out
of
control
with
too
big
esters
and
phenolic
flavors
although
they
should
be
there
just
seem
a
bit
too
much
and
too
boozy
just
too
much
going
on
with
this
it
wasnt
really
sure
where
it
wanted
to
be
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
it
aged
really
well
o
a
delicious
brew
the
booze
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
found
this
as
a
real
treat
the
belgian
twang
seemed
to
mesh
perfectly
with
the
sour
component
from
the
asian
pear
juice
unfortunately
i
cant
speak
to
how
cellaring
affected
the
palate
but
is
certainly
didnt
hurt
it
i
can
say
the
10
abv
was
virtually
undetectable
d
a
solid
beer
but
not
much
more
than
that
this
one
takes
some
risks
which
are
appreciated
but
the
end
result
is
an
average
at
best
offering
compared
to
its
belgian
strong
pale
ale
brethren
this
one
pales
in
comparison
the
10
abv
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
especially
given
that
the
overall
enjoyment
is
a
bit
lacking
my
borscht
and
vodka
have
arrived
maybe
that
will
help
happy
21st
beer
is
medium

on
the
end
it
is

not
great
but
a
nice

belgian
ale
i
might
even
have
it
again
o
i
think
i
see
what
they
are
doing
with
this
beer
its
a
of
beat
ale
that
plays
with
the
pallet
but
enjoyable
but
not
sessionable
o
one
of
my
favorites
easy
good
drinking
sweet
and
tart
one
of
a
kind
good
but
not
great
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a

soon
settled
and
a

soft

a

as
it

i
dont
know
how
i

its
ok
its
different
and
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
the
first
sip
was
very
tart
and
caught
me
off
guard
the
flavors
here
arent
too
complex
overall
not
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
have
any
more
first
i
wrote
tangier
but
i
thought
thatd
be
confusing
at
first
glance
to
anyone
with
a
sense
of
geography
drinkability
isnt
too
high
to
me
it
taste
like
an
overaged
trippel
maybe
just
the
pear
juice
regardless
not
digging
it
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
reddish

color

is

this

was

this
is
strike

for
the
cru
beers
of
the
lips

sweet
for
me
and
very

the
bottle
is
stamped

i
guess
thats
the
bottled
on
date
but
im
not
exactly
sure
of
that
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
pears
bready
malt
candy
sugar
and
a
bit
of
sweet
spices
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
the
flavors
dont
seem
quite
as
strong
for
some
reason
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
and
is
well
carbonated
its
a
solid
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
i
think
its
worth
trying
overall
a
very
mild
tasting
belgian
ale
which
was
a
little
astringent
a
bit
fruity
and
had
a
strong
alcohol
presence
d
this
was
a
nice
bspa
with
good
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
but
easily
enjoyable
recommended
fresh
this
looked
like
a
flanders
red
ale
which
might
explain
my
sour
cherry
taste
i
didnt
get
any
pear
flavor
like
the
other
reviewers
when
i
sat
down
to
think
about
this
review
i
realized
this
was
basically
an
imperial
fat
tire
aged
in
oak
barrels
that
turned
me
off
a
bit
but
for
the
illogical
reason
that
i
like
to
be
surprised
by
the
brewers
creativity
this
really
would
have
been
a
better
beer
if
they
kept
the
oaky
flavors
more
muted
i
like
some
oak
but
a
little
goes
a
long
way
an
interesting
if
unremarkable
beer
bright
golden
copper
body
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
white
ring
smells
like
bready
biscuit
malts
pear
juice
yeast
and
spice
the
bottle
says
they
started
with
fat
tire
and
doubled
the
malts
and
thats
what
it
tastes
like
big
bready
flavor
with
pear
and
spice
hops
are
fairly
well
hidden
mouthfeel
starts
heavy
with
all
the
bread
flavor
but
finishes
softer
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
feel
has
decent
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
with
hints
of
spice
overall
i
would
say
im
not
impressed
and
probably
wont
buy
this
again
not
too
bad
i
liked
it
well
enough
o
belgianstyled
meh
strong
meh
it
was
a
good
idea
but
i
think
it
might
have
sounded
better
on
paper
as
the
ingredients
didnt
blend
of
shine
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
still
a
good
beer
though
just
tough
style
to
compete
in
o
this
is
great
sitting
around
drinking
beer
good
with
a
cigar
or
during
a
cookout
jd
o
im
completely
in
the
minority
on
this
one
but
i
found
super
cru
to
be
very
solid
across
the
board
nothing
like
fat
tire
save
for
the
bike
depicted
on
the
bottle
not
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
complex
and
unique
i
find
it
a
good
brew
worth
picking
up
o
this
might
be
the
worst
new
belgium
beer
ive
had
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
o
a
decent
firstattempt
offering
im
hoping
they
can
bring
a
little
more
refinement
and
focus
to
this
on
the
next
round
wow
a
rare
complete
miss
from
new
belgium
on
this
one
candy
sweetness
and
rampant
fruit
mixes
with
a
serious
alcohol
presence
to
give
this
a
flavor
more
akin
to
something
you
find
at
a
frat
party
in
a
cooler
with
random
pieces
of
fruit
floating
around
in
it
i
am
already
wondering
if
i
can
finish
the
bomber
after
the
first
5
sips
or
so
the
toffee
malts
are
just
way
out
of
place
here
and
the
alcohol
is
very
rough
and
raw
bad
bad
beer
that
i
surely
will
never
buy
again
i
might
not
even
take
one
for
free
if
offered
reviewed
1023
taste
is
instant
raison
and
dried
cherries
molasses
and
malt
undertones
its
very
strong
and
you
can
feel
it
it
feels
like
that
little
box
of
raisons
enjoyed
in
my
lunch
bag
as
a
child
has
just
punched
me
in
the
mouth
in
a
way
where
im
not
mad
its
a
great
sipping
beer
id
imagine
this
to
be
great
next
to
a
warm
fire
with
a
pipe
save
this
drink
until
you
find
yourself
next
to
that
fire
pipe
optional
o
the
good
of
this
beer
just
doesnt
overcome
its
failings
overall
okay
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
just
not
that
tasty
for
being
what
it
is
and
the
abv
its
at
an
alright
example
of
the
style
nothing
too
exciting
here
overall
i
think
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
strangest
beers
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
in
a
good
way
it
was
very
ambitious
what
new
belgium
did
with
this
but
to
me
it
pays
off
this
is
some
good
stuff
very
complex
and
intricate
just
a
little
too
tart
for
my
taste
still
very
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
abv
is
well
hidden
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
happy
20th
to
new
belgium
i
thought
the
super
cru
was
an
average
offering
its
distinctive
in
flavor
but
not
very
special
in
delivery
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
while
i
like
the
idea
of
the
pear
juice
i
wasnt
quite
as
big
a
fan
of
the
execution
here
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
would
i
necessarily
request
it
or
reach
for
it
not
so
much
an
interesting
idea
that
went
a
little
unrealized
truth
is
that
ill
read
this
review
a
year
from
now
and
probably
forget
i
drank
the
beer
lets
just
say
that
i
drank
and
reviewed
it
during
the
dettex
mlb
playoff
game
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
beer
but
perhaps
a
reminder
for
me
that
i
actually
drank
the
beer
you
will
probably
forget
it
too
notes
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
pretty
pleasing
it
is
a
notch
above
common
offerings
and
it
flows
pretty
well
as
a
more
elaborate
brew
for
people
not
so
familiar
with
craft
brews
and
as
a
step
to
entice
them
into
more
complex
brews
in
that
context
socially
it
might
be
worth
the
repeat
d
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
better
than
any
that
i
have
ever
had
when
you
begin
to
feel
it
its
too
late
whether
that
is
well
done
on
the
brewers
part
or
not
is
up
to
the
enduser
overallinteresting
beer
that
i
enjoyed
alot
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
interesting
beer
that
changes
alot
throughout
the
drink
sip
it
and
enjoy
overall
impression
quite
the
brew
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
so
low
but
i
thought
it
was
a
great
lips
of
faith
beer
the
10
is
definitely
evident
within
finishing
the
12oz
glass
even
good
complexity
and
the
right
amount
of
strength
would
definitely
go
back
to
and
get
a
bottle
of
go
grab
yours
while
they
are
left
for
a
sweet
10
beer
super
cru
remains
delicate
in
feel
complex
in
composition
and
very
drinkable
and
it
doesnt
resemble
fat
tire
in
the
slightest
which
is
the
foundation
of
this
beer
according
to
the
bottle
text
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
overall
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
great
one
the
pear
juice
and
spice
flavors
just
overwhelmed
the
beer
flavors
for
me
would
have
really
liked
to
see
more
of
the
double
fat
tire
flavors
come
through
more
its
a
bit
of
a
mixedup
mess
but
experiments
are
gambles
sometimes
and
not
everything
is
for
everyone
not
perfect
not
amazing
but
very
interesting
and
tasty
for
sure
big
beer
brewed
with
asian
pear
juice
shiny
copper
color
twofinger
head
drops
to
a
thin
ring
of
lace
some
vague
floral
fruitiness
meets
spiciness
with
medicinal
herb
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
some
smoothness
slick
with
a
big
body
mild
tartness
with
a
thick
malty
foundation
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
up
front
toasted
bread
and
ripe
fruit
soon
make
way
for
a
more
toasty
dry
almost
brothlike
flavor
spicy
boozy
alcohol
rose
water
and
tropical
fruit
semidry
finish
clings
to
the
booziness
a
serious
beer
if
strength
is
considered
though
beyond
that
it
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
that
was
expected
a
tasty
brew
nonetheless
overall
not
as
super
as
i
was
led
to
believe
but
nothing
really
wrong
here
i
didnt
hate
it
but
wont
buy
again
o
nbs
lips
of
faith
super
cru
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
liked
it
for
what
it
is
an
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
pale
with
a
hearty
dose
of
pear
juice
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
rushing
back
to
this
often
but
i
certainly
did
enjoy
my
half
of
the
bomber
overall
not
bad
just
little
too
much
pear
juice
for
me
would
probably
be
good
or
better
if
they
just
left
it
out
quite
sweet
bordering
on
cloying
i
could
appreciate
the
pear
flavors
in
this
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
pretty
much
a
mess
pours
a
nice
amberorange
color
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
plenty
of
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
on
this
beer
very
clear
in
appearance
and
very
easy
to
see
all
the
way
through
nose
is
yeast
malt
pear
apple
hops
are
surprisingly
absent
so
far
in
the
smell
maybe
once
it
warms
a
bit
yes
theyre
coming
out
w
warming
taste
is
unique
and
slightly
strange
to
me
the
hops
show
up
a
bit
but
its
mainly
pear
juice
and
malt
that
i
get
w
pear
juice
being
on
the
strong
side
everything
seems
just
a
little
out
of
balance
to
me
its
not
horrible
its
just
not
great
mouthfeel
is
syrup
smooth
and
very
sweet
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
this
category
overall
this
beer
is
just
a
little
off
it
sounds
like
a
good
idea
when
you
read
the
description
of
the
beer
but
the
end
result
just
doesnt
quite
make
it
pours
somewhere
between
copper
and
amber
with
plenty
of
active
carbonation
and
thinnish
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
malty
up
front
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
notes
sweet
fruity
notes
come
up
after
apple
or
pear
i
suppose
a
touch
of
cherry
slight
citrus
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
right
away
lots
of
caramel
and
fruit
notes
strong
pear
and
cherry
notes
turning
a
bit
sourish
with
a
touch
of
hops
coming
in
at
the
end
along
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
spice
notes
a
very
full
body
from
the
intense
sweetness
the
carbonation
helps
lighten
it
up
a
bit
but
not
nearly
enough
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
nice
anniversary
beer
grab
a
few
and
lay
them
down
for
a
few
years
not
representative
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
not
sure
it
has
a
definitive
style
though
d
quite
easy
drinking
for
something
at
10abv
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
its
not
going
to
make
its
way
onto
my
favorites
list
and
at
the
price
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
however
i
dont
regret
spending
the
money
to
try
it
overall
not
much
going
on
here
i
love
asian
pears
but
i
get
no
sense
of
this
on
here
at
all
greeny
apple
like
taste
come
more
apparent
as
it
warms
its
not
too
bad
but
i
do
not
see
myself
gravitating
to
this
strongly
lips
of
faith
super
cru
is
good
in
a
fruittartwithwhippedcream
kind
of
way
o
ridiculous
and
unpalateful
beer
i
poured
the
rest
out
feels
a
little
heavy
handed
on
the
sweetness
but
the
base
recipe
is
a
pretty
straightforward
90s
era
microbrew
amber
ale
so
i
guess
that
makes
sense
i
can
appreciate
the
tribute
to
the
beer
that
built
the
brewery
so
ill
take
it
for
the
artistic
homage
that
it
is
i
enjoy
a
fat
tire
and
its
a
lot
of
fun
to
see
what
happens
when
a
flagship
beer
is
used
for
inspiration
in
the
more
creative
endeavors
o
well
its
beer
but
the
yeast
is
overbearing
and
does
not
allow
the
juice
to
come
through
to
the
extent
i
hope
they
intended
with
a
really
sweet
malt
profile
and
no
alcohol
burn
this
beer
becomes
lopsided
in
favor
of
decadence
vs
drinkability
just
a
little
too
much
going
on
decent
and
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
would
have
again
been
lookin
at
the
bottle
for
some
time
figured
id
just
rock
the
tap
at
the
firkin
it
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
caramel
sourdough
light
tart
black
cherry
light
roasted
malts
and
light
maple
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
maple
syrup
light
wood
an
amalgam
of
oak
and
balsa
light
roasted
malts
light
coffee
toffee
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
a
twinge
of
green
apple
skin
something
akin
to
maplesmoked
bacon
is
in
there
too
all
told
its
not
the
greatest
taste
combination
ive
ever
experienced
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
medium
carbonation
and
a
nearly
syrupy
feel
overall
though
its
not
an
entirely
bad
beer
i
feel
it
is
definitely
misnamed
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
sure
as
hell
dont
want
another
one
clear
reddish
brown
pour
without
much
head
the
smell
is
pretty
belgian
caramel
malts
some
candied
sugar
sweet
overall
the
taste
follows
the
smell
candied
sugar
lots
of
malts
this
is
boozy
and
has
an
offputting
aftertaste
not
unlike
kick
light
and
carbonated
well
honestly
disappointed
thought
these
lips
of
faith
beers
would
be
better
overall
very
good
the
faint
pear
sweetness
adds
something
i
dont
normally
find
in
this
type
if
beer
and
i
like
it
it
decreases
the
alcohol
warmth
and
takes
the
edge
off
some
of
the
spice
flavors
very
drinkable
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
this
belgian
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
honey
golden
with
a
finebubbled
pale
honeygolden
head
rich
fruity
aroma
has
a
hint
of
caramel
lipsmacking
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
and
has
caramel
honey
and
woody
hints
fullbodied
texture
is
fizzy
and
sassy
o
this
is
tasty
it
may
not
be
what
you
expect
going
in
but
is
still
is
pretty
nice
medium
amber
color
beer
with
a
small
quickly
fading
head
looks
about
like
fat
tire
fairly
fruity
nose
with
a
solid
malt
presence
yummy
flavor
good
initial
malt
gives
way
to
extremely
fruity
yeast
taste
on
the
order
of
chimay
grand
reserve
or
perhaps
beyond
it
some
of
it
may
be
the
pears
though
i
dont
taste
pear
notes
specifically
hops
are
provide
a
great
balance
to
the
sweetness
of
this
very
strong
beer
theres
a
nice
subtle
tartness
as
well
spicy
phenols
make
for
a
nice
finish
overall
i
like
the
interesting
concept
even
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fat
tire
this
beer
had
potential
but
falls
short
in
many
ways
does
it
want
to
be
a
sour
a
stronger
fat
tire
a
fruit
beer
a
saison
it
doesnt
matter
that
its
not
brewed
to
a
specific
style
but
there
is
little
direction
overall
and
it
all
doesnt
come
together
too
great
super
cru
is
not
the
model
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
fruity
sweet
and
lacking
any
real
hops
character
meh
proabably
wouldnt
have
again
especially
at
the
price
d
very
good
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
lips
of
faith
so
far
asian
pears
always
taste
like
a
mix
of
honey
and
pears
to
me
so
their
presence
is
felt
this
is
a
great
brew
it
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
clove
spice
and
fresh
pear
in
the
background
is
caramel
malt
and
lemon
hops
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
pear
juice
right
up
front
following
is
belgian
yeast
clove
alcohol
and
lots
of
bready
malt
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
soft
carbonation
and
a
warming
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
the
texture
was
like
juice
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
saison
yeast
added
a
nice
touch
pours
decently
with
a
transparent
orange
and
a
slight
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
hot
and
sweet
as
well
vaguely
fruity
but
i
couldnt
tell
you
if
its
asian
pear
the
smell
is
simply
not
delineated
enough
the
taste
is
similar
better
when
its
cold
when
it
warms
up
it
tastes
a
bit
like
cheap
fruit
juice
of
indeterminate
fruit
laced
with
vodka
a
bit
harsh
in
the
mouth
as
well
with
a
slight
acetone
finish
id
give
this
one
a
miss
its
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
the
belgian
spices
are
just
too
much
to
enjoy
t
some
cinnamon
pear
and
apple
a
slight
bit
of
malt
on
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
the
finish
gets
a
bit
off
and
a
bready
yeasty
and
slightly
metallic
flavor
comes
in
o
it
tastes
more
or
less
as
advertised
double
fat
tire
with
belgian
yeast
and
added
pear
juice
the
flavors
do
work
well
together
but
the
pear
juice
was
something
different
my
palate
adjusted
to
during
the
course
of
my
pour
as
the
last
few
posters
have
noted
im
not
sure
why
this
has
such
horrible
ratings
even
much
much
worse
than
that
of
fat
tire
it
is
certainly
a
better
more
complex
beer
my
only
qualms
were
with
the
fact
that
10
abv
tasted
and
felt
like
15
an
interesting
take
on
the
regular
fat
tire
recipe
not
bad
at
all
i
dont
know
what
everyones
problem
with
this
beer
is
maybe
that
its
brewed
with
a
nontraditional
yeast
but
thats
what
makes
it
unique
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
retains
and
laces
very
well
the
aroma
has
hints
of
banana
caramel
and
clive
spices
the
taste
starts
caramel
sweet
then
has
hints
of
banana
and
those
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
finishes
clean
definitely
no
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
this
is
tasty
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
super
fruity
beer
not
sure
if
its
got
all
the
qualities
for
the
style
but
i
thought
it
was
great
o
a
good
beer
not
the
greatest
but
appreciate
new
belgium
thinking
outside
the
box
with
their
lips
of
faith
series
on
tap
at
my
work
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
scent
is
packed
with
pear
juice
and
spicy
zest
belgian
yeast
aromas
hit
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
fruit
and
spices
the
taste
is
a
little
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
all
the
candied
fruit
flavors
and
sweet
pear
juice
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
provide
a
bit
of
balance
but
not
much
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
unbalanced
and
all
over
the
place
a
bit
boozy
too
especially
as
it
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
and
a
little
syrupy
which
kinda
works
to
this
beers
advantage
imo
drinkability
is
fair
as
it
is
overly
sweet
and
boozy
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
not
even
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
lof
series
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
will
not
be
drinking
more
of
this
stuff
this
is
a
bit
odd
im
not
sure
exactly
what
its
trying
to
be
its
too
dark
and
rich
to
really
be
a
tripel
or
a
bspa
but
its
certainly
not
in
the
quadbsda
category
either
i
dont
mind
oddballs
but
they
need
to
taste
good
this
one
was
overly
sweet
and
lacked
balance
not
horrible
but
spend
your
ten
bucks
elsewhere
overall
i
have
had
better
on
tap
at
the
clips
of
faith
event
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
shimmering
copper
color
with

bananas

tartacidic
boozy
finish
a
strange
beer
decent
in
sample
size
as
a
dessert
type
of
thing
but
not
a
very
quaffable
drink
much
too
sweet
i
had
to
sort
of
force
the
rest
of
this
beer
down
since
the
flavor
was
absolutely
not
doing
anything
for
me
o
not
horrible
but
nothing
here
really
stood
out
to
me
and
made
me
want
to
drink
more
narrative
why
are
mommy
and
daddy
fighting
baby
apple
brandy
wondered
as
she
watched
her

tear
apart

had
now
reached
its

revert
back

and
threatening
no
one
in
particular
baby
apple
brandy
attempted
to
reconcile
this
hectic
environment
with
her
chaotic
upbringing
no
one
wanted
to
visit
no
one
wanted
to
stay
but
baby
apple
brandy
still
had
high
hopes
for
later
aging
o
pretty
smooth
considering
the
abv
yet
this
is
still
bordering
on
a
hot
mess
of
a
brew
that
being
said
its
still
an
interesting
sipper
lots
of
crazy
flavors
going
on
for
sure
this
beer
is
ok
it
is
a
belgian
with
a
slightly
odd
fruit
taste
that
doesnt
really
stack
up
to
other
belgian
beers
even
on
its
own
it
is
just
ok
not
mandatory
by
any
stretch
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
whiteorange
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
nice
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
normal
fat
tire
with
the
biscuitlike
malt
along
with
some
light
fruit
aromas
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
of
belgian
yeast
up
front
with
the
biscuit
malt
and
slight
pear
flavors
coming
afterwards
there
is
a
spice
taste
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
am
not
sure
why
the
overall
scores
have
been
so
low
to
each
his
own
i
have
to
admit
i
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
more
than
i
did
its
weird
and
unnecessary
but
not
undrinkable
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
herbs
and
spices
with
some
toffee
brown
sugar
and
fruity
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
belgian
yeast
with
some
pears
and
cherries
i
also
get
some
bready
malt
and
candy
sugar
as
well
as
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
is
10
percent
abv
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
its
an
amped
up
overly
sweet
fat
tire
with
some
fruit
juice
and
a
little
more
belgian
yeast
banana
so
lots
i
dont
really
care
for
sweetness
banana
and
biscuit
malt
final
thought
i
like
this
beer
if
you
like
beers
i
like
youll
like
this
beer
o
very
disappointed
i
love
fat
tire
this
was
nothing
at
all
like
fat
tire
id
rather
have
a
case
of
fat
tire
than
drink
one
of
these
again
wish
i
could
say
better
things
about
it
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
overall
its
sweet
its
a
bit
boozy
and
fairly
fruity
but
not
quite
cloying
or
hinderingly
brash
keeping
it
a
fair
soso
sipper
o
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
was
free
due
to
the
waitress
messing
up
my
order
a
clear
light
amber
in
color
with
no
head
smells
of
phenolic
peppery
yeast
taste
is
initially
sweet
light
caramel
followed
by
an
herbal
medicinal
lemony
middle
and
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
decent
drinkability
this
is
kind
of
a
wierd
beer
pretty
good
though
a
sweet
syrupy
heavy
belgian
that
seems
to
miss
the
mark
taste
is
not
good
i
get
the
pears
a
little
bit
along
with
quite
a
bit
of
burn
the
first
sip
was
not
so
bad
but
this
was
not
a
fun
one
to
finish
way
too
harsh
and
some
solvent
flavors
unfortunate
that
nb
feels
this
beer
should
be
called
super
cru
a
pale
amber
with
a
lemon
ice
colored
head
the
belgian
yeast
dominates
the
nose
with
a
ittle
bit
of
crushed
pear
lots
of
asian
pear
on
the
palette
the
beer
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
nice
fruitiness
and
light
body
the
juicy
pear
finish
is
sweet
and
hides
the
high
alcohol
well
certainly
tasty
and
not
deserving
of
the
c
rating
imo
good
lord
what
happened
here
super
cru
appears
like
it
should
starting
out
with
a
leathermahogany
color
frothy
head
doesnt
smell
too
bad
either
nice
belgian
yeasty
notes
and
the
added
pear
but
man
does
this
taste
awful
im
not
going
to
go
into
detail
on
this
one
doesnt
really
deserve
it
but
this
tastes
like
someone
dumped
pear
juice
into
fat
tire
treacly
and
boring
at
the
same
time
im
not
sure
how
this
was
grouped
with
the
lips
of
faith
series
i
did
sweeter
than
expected
and
would
be
better
classified
as
a
tripel
a
bit
phenolic
and
solventy
at
first
but
smoothes
out
after
a
bit
and
was
enjoyable
not
that
great
but
not
a
drainpour
cant
taste
the
abv
but
you
sure
can
feel
it
o
it
is
interesting
with
the
play
between
sweet
bitter
and
acerbic
it
may
be
too
much
for
some
but
i
think
its
interesting
and
worth
a
drink
o
this
might
be
a
bit
young
its
completely
all
over
the
place
and
doesnt
really
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
this
will
be
better
with
some
time
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
is
in
another
year
right
now
its
pretty
mediocre
just
had
the
lightest
of
aromas
some
nice
yeast
though
with
the
essence
of
apples
and
pears
coming
through
a
touch
of
apricot
in
the
back
some
light
grassy
like
hops
floating
around
as
well
not
bad
just
too
light
definitely
some
grain
in
here
to
i
have
seen
better
though
it
was
still
decent
not
being
really
bad
in
anyway
just
way
too
light
for
my
tastes
there
was
a
nice
presence
of
fruity
yeast
but
you
almost
had
to
look
for
it
which
was
unfortunate
hints
of
pears
and
apricot
again
maybe
some
light
apple
nice
bit
of
grainy
like
flavors
and
a
touch
of
grass
in
the
finish
a
decent
profile
for
sure
just
way
too
light
for
me
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
which
was
good
but
it
was
just
rather
bland
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
with
very
low
carbonation
very
forgettable
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
very
clear
and
translucent
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
it
looks
like
it
may
even
be
filtered
how
can
any
cru
look
this
clear
it
smells
god
awful
it
smells
of
fermenting
rotten
sweet
pears
i
didnt
know
i
was
composting
in
my
glass
great
it
tastes
of
rotten
fermenting
pears
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
honey
its
so
light
in
body
and
the
style
and
the
alcohol
content
i
dont
know
what
they
were
aiming
for
but
they
missed
horribly
at
10
49
a
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
especially
for
the
price
point
i
wish
theyd
take
a
moment
to
improve
their
lips
of
faith
series
le
terroir
was
and
is
phenomenal
their
dunkel
is
good
la
folie
is
exceptional
but
everything
else
is
low
grade
this
super
cru
never
shouldve
been
made
how
did
this
get
approved
avoid
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
it
granted
me
eternal
life
or
provided
me
with
an
opportunity
to
slap
ronald
reagan
pours
a
clear
copper
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
earthy
malt
alcohol
and
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
earthy
malt
slight
hop
slight
wood
and
hint
of
citrus
overall
good
blend
and
decent
aroma
creamy
and
smooth
will
most
likely
climb
in
complexity
and
richness
if
aged
d
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
what
this
drink
had
to
offer
delicate
balance
of
fruit
malt
and
sugar
tones
could
have
another
one
opinion
again
i
am
certain
that
this
beer
was
just
sold
early
as
you
really
cant
condition
a
beer
this
big
long
enough
at
the
brewery
i
would
not
deter
you
from
getting
this
beer
as
about
5
years
in
a
cool
cellar
or
refrigerator
would
do
wonders
for
it
as
it
is
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
drink
the
yeast
is
just
too
strong
and
is
not
playing
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
as
it
is
i
will
be
scoring
this
one
a
bit
low
too
but
i
am
taking
in
mind
the
potential
that
this
beer
has
too
there
are
no
fermentation
flaws
to
kick
it
out
except
maybe
that
the
yeast
ran
a
bit
hot
for
my
taste
but
this
will
soften
with
age
too
overall
a
good
beer
nice
nose
a
decent
taste
with
no
distinguishing
features
not
particularly
successful
as
a
belgian
ale
of
any
sort
this
is
still
an
interesting
conglomeration
of
sessionable
amber
ale
with
vague
hints
of
saison
the
body
was
good
solid
without
being
heavy
full
and
nicely
rounded
drinkability
was
good
especially
for
a
bigger
beer
overall
a
very
nice
beer
if
i
see
this
in
bottles
i
may
set
a
couple
aside
to
let
the
hotness
smooth
out
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
i
am
somewhat
surprised
by
the
lower
scores
on
this
one
it
falls
right
in
with
the
style
and
to
me
is
done
very
well
as
it
warms
i
tend
to
enjoy
it
more
a
lot
going
on
at
some
points
but
still
good
the
whole
time
but
that
is
the
joy
of
this
site
to
each
their
own
yeah
tartness
is
a
good
word
for
the
flavor
too
almost
too
much
so
the
pear
is
overripe
or
something
ive
had
asian
pears
and
these
in
this
here
beer
are
past
their
prime
or
perhaps
they
dont
blend
well
with
the
yeast
or
malt
i
dont
know
but
it
doesnt
quite
work
out
the
malt
is
firm
and
rich
but
then
turns
a
bit
sour
is
this
a
sour
ale
it
misses
on
the
bspa
style
for
me
o
this
beer
sounded
very
interesting
so
i
had
to
try
it
things
start
off
pretty
good
but
the
flavors
compete
a
little
bit
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
unpleasant
definitely
earns
points
for
being
unique
drink
well
its
a
tasty
beer
but
below
my
expectations
the
fruit
was
up
front
with
the
malts
on
the
back
seems
like
a
lot
of
juice
with
some
beer
and
of
course
as
i
finish
the
10
comes
into
play
damn
o
good
concept
perhaps
but
not
done
to
its
potential
esters
and
malting
are
a
bit
too
powerful
but
then
im
picky
o
the
beer
isnt
that
easy
to
drink
and
needs
to
be
sipped
very
slowly
given
its
strong
flavors
and
high
alcohol
content
o
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
i
dont
see
where
the
early
c
is
coming
from
this
is
solid
american
belgianstyle
beer
very
enjoyable
and
well
done
not
much
of
a
pale
ale
but
very
good
none
the
less
something
i
would
recommend
o
this
beer
was
not
my
favorite
from
new
belgium
yet
it
is
also
not
the
worst
thing
i
have
had
from
them
they
are
a
company
that
is
a
love
and
hate
thing
for
me
in
the
lips
of
faith
department
i
wish
they
would
stray
away
from
the
tootsie
roll
malt
that
seems
to
be
their
base
as
it
messes
up
too
many
of
their
lof
beers
other
than
that
i
didnt
mind
the
two
or
three
step
beer
that
i
poured
the
abv
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
a
full
22oz
but
i
think
the
blending
could
have
been
done
a
little
better
as
well
i
like
this
better
as
i
sip
awhile
seems
a
little
coarse
at
first
taste
hot
with
alcohol
and
reminds
me
of
a
dark
rum
splashed
with
water
surprising
lightness
of
body
with
a
carnival
of
fruity
flavors
balanced
with
the
dark
toasty
belgian
taste
mf
a
spicy
slowdrinker
not
huge
in
body
or
flavors
but
each
sip
still
warrants
savoring
and
contemplating
o
meh
nothing
pops
on
this
the
flavor
profiles
fall
short
and
it
seems
just
like
a
bad
attempt
at
a
beer
and
its
sorry
to
say
because
i
love
new
belgium
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
a
decent
soda
with
alochol
added
overall
worst
10
ever
i
know
the
store
i
was
at
was
a
bit
pricy
in
general
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
if
it
was
three
bucks
a
bomber
just
not
a
very
good
beer
plain
and
simple
firm
up
the
body
here
clearly
just
doubling
the
recipe
isnt
working
to
keep
the
balance
in
check
the
yeast
able
to
eat
its
way
over
9
abv
can
clearly
make
short
work
of
the
fat
tire
malts
furthermore
i
wouldnt
stick
with
the
pear
juice
either
this
seems
to
be
a
case
of
jamming
10
pounds
of
shit
in
a
5
pound
bag
before
seeing
if
the
bag
can
handle
5
pounds
in
the
first
place
skip
this
one
until
they
get
the
recipe
correct
o
wont
try
this
one
again
one
and
donejust
had
a
brandy
and
fruit
taste
to
me
with
no
character
just
a
mess
this
one
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
perfect
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
head
beautiful
sadly
it
was
downhill
from
there
aromas
of
yeast
green
apples
and
pears
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
apples
lemon
and
pears
medium
bodied
with
spirited
but
not
aggressive
carbonation
finish
is
total
french
whore
perfume
oh
god
it
just
wont
go
away
turrible
pours
a
copperamber
color
super
clear
and
clean
with
a
nice
big
tan
head
the
nose
is
big
saison
yeast
complimented
with
a
touch
of
sweet
apple
pear
and
biscuit
malt
nothing
too
impressive
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
big
flavors
of
apple
and
pear
that
biscuit
malt
flavor
from
fat
tire
is
present
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spice
and
that
saison
yeastiness
its
kinda
like
a
really
sweet
fruitier
version
of
fat
tire
missing
just
a
bit
of
that
richness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
good
not
too
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
sweet
but
not
overly
coating
finish
overall
this
i
not
quite
what
i
expected
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
how
it
would
have
worked
otherwise
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
a
touch
and
replaced
with
more
of
that
signature
rich
malt
flavor
from
fat
tire
but
im
nitpicking
i
though
this
beer
was
alright
and
am
somewhat
surprised
by
the
average
score
edit
gets
solventy
as
it
warms
and
loses
some
flavor
drink
it
cold
points
docked
accordingly
it
was
great
initially
this
sounded
great
but
i
was
disappointed
flavors
did
not
meld
well
together
and
it
is
somewhat
astringent
its
really
hard
for
me
to
say
im
disappointed
just
because
i
think
this
probably
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
is
what
i
expected
its
not
really
good
or
bad
but
at
910
per
bottle
its
something
i
cant
imagine
many
beer
geeks
going
back
to
o
i
dont
know
what
new
belgium
was
thinking
this
is
their
20th
anniversary
beer
i
was
sooo
excited
for
this
beer
as
new
belgium
makes
some
amazing
lips
of
faith
beers
but
i
feel
like
they
couldve
done
something
more
special
for
their
anniversary
dont
get
me
wrong
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
or
anything
i
just
was
expecting
more
ill
finish
the
bomber
but
that
will
probably
be
the
last
time
i
have
this
beer
i
found
it
odd
that
nb
decided
to
use
asian
pear
juice
while
a
unique
ingredient
asian
pears
are
special
due
to
their
crispness
and
texture
not
their
command
of
flavor
bad
investment
even
at
8
99
a
bomber
the
recent
lips
of
faith
have
been
excellent
but
imo
this
is
the
biggest
let
down
since
vrienden
lacks
the
balance
body
and
sessionable
feel
which
fat
tire
brings
to
the
table
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
again
its
your
20
year
anniversary
nb
next
time
lets
celebrate
with
a
party
not
a
hangover
22
oz
bomber
beautiful
copper
red
pour
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
descripted
as
fat
tire
as
the
base
with
asain
pear
juice
it
has
the
maltiness
of
fat
tire
on
the
aroma
along
with
a
added
belgian
yeast
characteristic
mildly
carbonated
touches
of
caramel
and
yeasty
flavors
and
an
interesting
fruit
sweetness
has
a
sticky
malt
finish
my
wife
is
a
big
fat
tire
fan
but
found
this
one
too
bready
for
her
taste
as
a
belgian
beer
fan
i
thought
it
was
an
improvement
in
terms
of
style
possibly
classify
as
an
american
amber
like
its
little
brother
which
is
a
much
better
beer
finishes
with
an
outstanding
malt
supported
bitterness
which
occupies
the
tongue
for
quite
a
time
harsh
medicinal
slightly
soapy
booze
draft
over
spiced
harsh
bitterness
was
hoping
for
more
kind
of
boring
overall
the
first
sip
was
a
shock
expected
it
to
follow
the
nose
but
it
was
harshly
bitter
and
dry
very
grassy
and
spicy
with
mostly
clove
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
the
taste
mellowed
out
and
became
very
pleasant
pouring
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
in
smooths
out
the
taste
and
brings
up
more
fruitiness
and
spices
in
the
end
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
flavorful
and
complex
would
recommend
to
have
this
one
on
tap
at
the
bier
stein
yesterday
very
complex
nose
and
flavor
profile
with
considerable
spice
clove
and
nutmeg
in
particular
but
with
a
very
dry
citrus
and
white
pepper
bitterness
on
the
finish
on
the
palate
you
initially
get
considerable
tropical
fruit
but
thats
quickly
pushed
aside
by
the
dry
hoppy
spiced
fused
finish
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
and
drinkability
is
excellent
though
with
all
the
different
flavors
in
this
beer
its
one
you
want
to
savor
appreciate
and
enjoy
really
a
nice
beere
from
de
dolle
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
de
dolle
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
at
first
with
interesting
tropical
and
citrus
blend
of
flavor
that
has
a
mild
spice
element
with
herbal
hop
taste
and
gentle
white
grape
coming
from
the
yeast
there
is
a
slight
pepper
aspect
and
mild
lemon
rind
which
is
palatable
with
mild
herbal
bitterness
coming
through
with
a
very
dry
crisp
finish
which
is
mostly
yeast
driven
however
a
subtle
tropical
taste
of
golden
grapefruit
is
present
overall
a
wonderful
belgian
pale
to
quaff
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
8
the
only
attribute
that
is
lacking
is
taste
slightly
but
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
better
this
was
when
fresh
outstanding
seemed
pretty
farmhouse
saisonlike
nose
of
belgian
yeastsaison
taste
very
earthygrassyhay
and
dry
pours
a
hazy
gold
orange
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
some
lacing
aroma
and
taste
begins
with
nice
dose
of
citrus
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
notes
followed
by
a
bit
of
biscuit
malt
sweet
spices
and
a
zesty
tangy
lightly
spiced
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
crisp
with
good
carbonation
the
end
much
the
same
as
taste
citrus
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
zesty
tangy
spiced
hops
bitterness
with
some
biscuit
malt
overall
a
very
pleasant
flavorful
and
tasty
brew
i
would
drink
again
normal
pour
fills
23
of
the
glass
with
a
dense
white
foam
even
surface
close
to
zero
lacing
retention
is
very
good
though
cloudy
liquid
with
a
healthy
amount
of
particulate
golden
orange
in
color
could
be
rust
water
huge
amount
of
visible
bubbles
walltowall
activity
the
nose
has
a
rough
texture
to
it
wheat
and
grains
earth
and
peppercorns
before
slightly
softening
into
banana
white
grape
and
apricot
pits
not
that
sweet
and
the
clove
to
nutmeg
spice
could
show
more
oomph
stays
within
itself
well
in
the
mouth
its
fullbodied
and
tends
to
be
bottom
heavy
the
carbonation
is
indeed
strong
so
it
makes
you
imagine
what
the
feel
would
be
like
without
it
much
more
floral
here
with
lemon
accents
the
clove
stronger
as
well
for
all
the
sweetness
in
the
pear
yellow
apple
apricot
to
banana
fruit
dryness
takes
over
past
the
midpalate
hay
quinine
spent
lees
iron
flecks
sort
of
heads
in
many
directions
at
once
astringent
ending
but
cant
call
it
herbaceous
nor
really
green
in
any
manner
seems
to
unclench
some
as
it
warms
so
may
be
one
to
linger
over
rather
than
quaff
with
abandon
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
another
nice
belgian
beer
fruity
with
plenty
of
citrus
pineapple
the
highlights
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
hidden
for
the
most
part
with
only
faint
hints
of
it
appearing
in
places
this
one
is
a
beer
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
poured
a
very
pretty
gold
with
mild
haze
adorned
with
a
large
white
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
a
fairly
complex
nose
honeycrisp
apples
bartlett
pears
touch
of
riesling
clove
white
pepper
and
apricots
maybe
some
golden
raisins
too
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
bit
of
earthiness
not
like
the
lambic
kind
though
its
tough
to
explain
that
one
maybe
from
the
hop
variety
they
use
but
the
beer
is
superbly
smooth
and
drinkable
quite
a
fantastic
beer
overall
my
third
variety
of
beer
from
this
brewer
and
they
have
all
been
amazing
another
world
class
beer
from
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
brewers
great
mix
of
flavours
and
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
d
decently
drinkable
beer
somewhere
in
between
a
session
beer
and
a
sipper
for
me
dont
necessarily
know
what
occasion
id
recommend
it
for
o
this
was
by
no
means
a
bottle
in
tiptop
shape
but
its
a
credit
to
de
dolle
that
this
beer
still
turned
out
to
be
tasty
refreshing
and
enjoyable
the
nose
and
taste
are
like
a
mixed
fruit
bowl
that
has
been
plunged
into
a
bath
of
yeast
then
had
pepper
dusted
onto
it
before
someone
squirts
lemon
juice
all
over
it
now
boil
it
and
take
out
the
lumpy
bits
add
some
hops
reboil
allow
it
to
settle
in
a
bottle
for
a
while
and
then
its
ready
to
drink
served
in
beautiful
oerbier
stemware
bright
goldenstraw
body
thick
endless
white
foam
which
enhances
the
beautiful
appearance
and
feel
of
this
beer
nice
notes
of
citrus
peppercorn
champagne
spice
clove
and
yeast
sparkling
carbonation
really
nice
stuff
superb
beer
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
is
hard
to
beat
hoppy
as
a
belgian
ipa
and
amazingly
fruity
complex
and
still
very
easy
to
drink
dangerous
beer
this
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
it
was
very
heady
and
took
multiple
times
to
pour
it
the
head
has
a
slightly
soapy
taste
the
beer
is
fairly
bitter
which
is
uncommon
for
this
style
very
sappy
resins
tasting
there
is
a
fruit
under
taste
slight
carbonation
while
i
drink
but
that
could
be
from
the
10
minutes
it
took
to
pour
overall
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
pours
cloudy
golden
with
a
head
that
explodes
up
the
glass
took
a
while
to
get
the
whole
bottle
poured
maybe
theres
soap
in
this
thing
aroma
is
banana
clove
funky
yeast
and
an
unpleasant
bitterness
flavor
feels
overly
spiced
and
bitter
not
in
a
hops
way
but
in
a
licking
a
shoe
way
hint
of
banana
but
finishes
with
a
funky
aftertaste
not
a
drain
pour
since
it
cost
me
5
50
but
this
thing
just
tastes
dirty
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
maybe
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
this
ale
has
so
much
going
on
and
possesses
so
much
quality
that
it
needs
to
be
tried
by
anyone
who
crosses
its
path
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
beer
trappe
in
lexington
ky
it
pours
golden
yellow
into
a
snifter
with
a
minimal
lacy
head
this
beer
is
all
about
the
nose
lemon
predominates
over
pears
apples
and
clove
spiced
bread
wonderful
the
initial
taste
is
honey
sweet
fruit
but
finishes
moderately
bitter
and
dry
the
bitterness
is
a
surprise
after
the
smell
and
initial
taste
and
does
not
perfectly
imtegrate
with
the
initial
impression
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
but
astringent
at
the
end
like
a
dry
wine
or
cider
i
believe
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
just
for
the
smell
unique
in
the
dominance
of
resin
and
one
of
the
more
bitter
examples
of
the
style
ive
experienced
balance
is
decidedly
hops
though
more
bittering
than
flavoring
good
belgian
ester
presence
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
o
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
balanced
sweetness
complex
and
easy
to
drink
o
quite
tasty
this
would
probably
be
better
fresh
but
its
still
drinking
great
right
now
regardless
this
is
one
of
those
mildly
strange
beers
that
really
makes
you
contemplate
it
think
of
it
as
duvels
slightly
loopy
but
lovable
younger
brother
o
a
unique
beautiful
and
incredibly
complex
golden
ale
superb
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
and
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
undoubtedly
a
geeky
beer
in
my
opinion
hard
to
fully
appreciate
the
beer
is
about
as
fresh
it
can
be
at
the
moment
and
rigid
to
drink
in
big
gulps
even
though
i
would
love
to
as
the
spring
is
about
to
arrive
here
in
new
york
i
cant
help
but
to
envision
sitting
with
a
tall
tulip
glass
of
this
enjoying
one
of
the
earliest
balmy
spring
suns
to
sum
the
appraise
this
beer
is
original
complex
and
highly
aromatic
httpquaffable

i
picked
up
a
nice
orange
marmalade
note
on
this
brew
totally
dig
it
ive
had
plenty
of
belgians
before
but
what
struck
me
about
this
one
was
how
wellbalanced
it
was
from
start
to
finish
none
the
typically
distinguishing
characteristics
overpowered
it
extremely
sessionable
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
perfect
level
of
moderate
to
lively
carbonation
the
liveliness
of
the
carbonation
assists
in
moving
the
flavors
of
this
strong
brew
across
the
tongue
without
becoming
taxing
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
definitively
state
how
old
this
brew
is
but
of
course
such
a
means
is
not
precisely
documented
i
can
hardly
make
out
a
marking
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
that
reads
350
07
which
makes
me
think
this
was
a
2007
best
by
date
regardless
the
age
is
felt
in
this
with
the
oxidative
touch
and
visually
the
bottle
is
stained
in
the
familiar
pattern
conducive
of
a
beer
that
has
been
resting
for
quite
some
time
plain
and
simple
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
and
drink
it
instead
of
laying
it
aside
for
years
at
a
time
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
o
nice
bitterness
but
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
and
rocky
head
in
the
aroma
notes
of
fruitiness
and
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
yeasty
dryness
and
a
dryer
candy
sugar
with
notes
of
fruit
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
candy
sugar
presence
in
the
aftertaste
quite
nice
and
kind
of
simple
light
nose
and
flavors
but
nice
nonetheless
straight
up
delicious
cheers
overall
i
might
actually
pick
up
another
old
bottle
of
this
for
3
bucks
a
very
easy
drinking
great
tasting
belgium
pale
ale
overall

something
tells
me
i
got
a
very
old
bottle
of
this
beer
it
tastes
oxidized
with
some
odd
phenolic
notes
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
looking
over
some
other
reviews
what
im
tasting
seeing
and
smelling
doesnt
resemble
what
others
seem
to
have
had
very
much
at
all
my
guess
is
that
this
is
an
off
and
or
old
bottle
id
really
like
to
revisit
this
sometime
with
a
bottle
that
i
know
is
fresh
o
a
very
good
beer
with
the
highlights
being
the
appearance
inviting
aromas
and
balanced
flavors
harsh
mouthfeel
is
the
only
detractor
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
very
smooth
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
medium
carbonation
and
very
delicious
i
am
very
happy
to
be
enjoying
a
tulip
of
this
beer
another
solid
belgian
beer
to
cross
off
the
list
o
very
drinkable
something
between
a
strong
pale
ale
and
a
belgian
ipa
reminded
me
duvel
but
a
superspiced
version
of
absolutely
great
belgian
beer
o
another
interesting
brew
from
a
very
good
brewery
though
not
my
favorite
from
them
the
earthy
bitterness
and
the
fruitiness
didnt
seem
as
harmonious
as
they
could
have
been
but
i
would
still
have
this
again
i
popped
the
top
and
the
foam
charges
out
the
bottle
lively
carbonation
makes
a
spectacle
of
the
yeast
bits
floating
up
and
down
the
glass
big
ol
textured
head
doesnt
quit
nose
is
deep
rich
and
fruity
apple
pie
tart
grapes
buttered
rolls
taste
follows
suit
and
is
oh
so
smooth
mouthfeel
is
superbly
smooth
with
a
quick
effervescent
punch
and
a
decadent
finish
good
stuff
i
wasnt
sure
what
kind
of
beer
this
was
at
the
shop
but
i
couldnt
resist
the
funky
label
330
ml

dating

cloudy
golden

with
an
awesome
3

reduces
to
a
nice

some

is

extremely
easy

outstanding
d
recategorize
this
one
as
a
belgian
ipa
and
im
all
for
it
not
what
i
expect
from
a
bspa
im
sure
it
was
dry
hopped
and
all
that
jazz
and
being
so
hop
forward
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it
labeled
as
such
love
this
brewery
though
pour
is
a
transparent
color
with
pbs
of
tight
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
very
nice
lots
of
spicy
yeast
great
earthy
leather
note
underlying
caramel
and
sticky
malt
flavores
are
the
same
bright
lemon
and
golden
apricots
in
back
well
integrated
dry
light
body
soft
carb
great
beer
pours
a
fantastic
tawny
straw
color
into
my
chimay
goblet
the
head
on
it
somehow
manages
to
come
out
perfectly
flat
and
hanging
off
the
side
of
the
glass
like
icing
on
a
layer
cake
there
is
some
fine
sediment
present
in
the
glass
aroma
hints
of
fruit
banana
cherry
pear
and
tangy
orange
as
well
as
some
faint
hops
a
grainy
yeasty
character
and
the
alcohol
acidity
is
clear
as
well
the
flavor
is
softer
than
the
aroma
suggests
its
very
balanced
and
smooth
the
dominant
bready
malts
are
glossed
over
lightly
with
sweet
apple
and
tart
flavors
alcohol
is
hardly
noticed
the
mouth
feel
is
light
but
creamy
as
well
the
finish
has
a
pleasant
tingling
sensation
as
the
slight
bitterness
comes
out
another
great
selection
from
de
dolle
i
am
thinking
that
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
o
a
fantastic
beer
im
really
glad
that
i
was
able
to
pick
one
up
too
bad
its
too
rare
and
pricey
or
id
drink
this
much
more
often
it
may
not
be
the
best
comparison
but
this
is
like
a
richer
and
more
decadent
version
of
duvel
very
well
done
m
complex
sensation
formed
by
bitterness
that
remains
through
the
end
for
a
very
lasting
and
astringent
end
the
mouthfeel
is
my
favorite
part
of
any
de
dolle
brew
very
live
very
exciting
it
tingles
all
the
way
through
light
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
as
ive
said
with
my
other
reviews
of
de
dolle
buy
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
o
not
sure
its
worth
5
50
a
bottle
11
3
oz
maybe
its
better
on
tap
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
dont
understand
all
the
hype
crisp
and
slightly
tart
theres
a
strong
fruity
character
with
some
cookie
sweetness
underneath
and
a
touch
of
herbal
bitterness
apricot
golden
raisin
plum
or
peach
pits
dusty
bubblegum
honey
shortbread
effervescent
and
highly
charged
abv
is
completely
hidden
a
benchmark
bpa
a
classic
to
return
to
again
and
again
o
really
great
beer
this
is
absolutely
smashing
and
super
drinkable
a
must
have
d
very
high
this
would
make
an
awesome
summer
beer
in
that
it
is
complex
and
tasty
yet
light
and
refreshing
o
very
tasty
and
extremely
well
crafted
belgian
pale
ale
overall
very
nice
i
really
didnt
pick
up
the
bitter
aspects
in
the
nose
but
they
work
well
in
the
beer
good
stuff
overal
a
nice
beer
complex
a
benchmark
bspa
for
sure
and
just
another
fantastic
beer
from
de
dolle
o
a
really
unique
beer
which
is
definitely
worth
revisiting
every
so
often
for
its
nearperfect
feel
and
floral
honeylike
sweetness
de
dolle
no
doubt
knows
what
theyre
doing
o
just
a
great
beer
its
all
been
said
already
if
you
can
find
it
aquire
it
totally
worth
it
another
fantastic
beer
from
de
dolle
consumes
like
a
session
beer
super
easy
drinking
o
decentgood
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
regarding
the
style
i
like
bitter
beers
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
fit
so
well
in
this
one
apparently
only
getting
about
half
a
beer
tonight
popped
the
top
and
beer
went
everywhere
evidently
some
serious
bottle
carbonation
going
on
here
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
huge
head
that
went
everywhere
head
sticking
around
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
nice
and
tasty
aroma
with
sweetness
and
malt
on
the
back
end
flavor
is
amlty
but
definitely
noticeable
alcohol
on
the
end
color
is
fairly
cloudy
great
beer
dr
fairly
high
abv
with
very
easy
drinkability
the
price
is
rather
high
but
then
i
got
it
in
denmark
as
with
all
de
dolle
beers
this
is
a
ridiculous
gusher
pours
at
about
a
982
foam
to
beer
ratio
and
thats
not
an
exaggeration
doesnt
matter
how
cold
you
chill
it
it
could
be
a
halffrozen
slush
and
still
manage
a
huge
mountain
of
suds
after
a
requisite
waitingrepouring
period
i
am
looking
at
a
goldenorange
liquid
completely
opaque
with
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
big
on
spices
with
coriander
and
clove
leading
the
way
yeast
and
light
fruity
hops
as
well
flavor
is
lightly
tart
with
some
apricot
orange
peel
and
yeast
solid
hoppiness
floral
with
a
light
bitterness
dry
palate
with
a
bit
of
peppery
alcohol
lively
carbonation
obviously
a
very
nice
strong
golden
ale
o
another
excellent
beer
from
de
dolle
this
one
is
tougher
to
find
but
worth
the
effort
overall
i
had
a
little
moment
with
this
beer
it
just
reminded
me
of
how
very
much
i
love
beer
and
why
havent
had
much
from
de
dolle
however
will
try
anything
i
can
get
my
hands
on
after
this
brew
ahh
content
overall
one
word
beauty
normally
a
fan
of
tart
and
sour
character
but
found
it
too
overbearing
and
adversely
impacting
on
the
yeast
and
ester
profile
o
the
bitterness
of
the
enormous
head
here
has
totally
overwhelmed
the
more
subtle
flavours
of
the
bier
first
time
ive
ever
drank
some
water
in
the
middle
of
a
review
to
try
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
flavours
but
it
still
doesnt
completely
eliminate
the
bitterness
im
sure
theres
a
really
good
bier
under
the
bitterness
but
its
not
coming
through
today
no
slouch
here
but
doesnt
deliver
the
goods
as
promised
notes
an
arabier
is
a
pure
malt
beer
8volalc
brewed
with
flower
nuggethops
from
poperinge
it
has
the
special
dryhopping
taste
and
aroma
so
appreciated
by
beer
lovers
all
over
the
world
it
is
one
of
the
two
main
beers
from
de
dolle
brouwers
throughout
the
year
aging
time
is
limited
due
to
the
fact
that
hop
bitterness
is
declining
with
the
time
store
arabier
cool
and
dark
and
serve
cool
at
10c
pours
a
darker
coppery
amber
color
huge
plume
of
prickly
white
bubbles
akin
to
many
bottle
conditioned
beers
retention
leaves
about
a
half
centimeter
of
bubbled
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
scent
is
quite
a
blend
of
sour
over
rippened
fruit
day
old
bread
and
over
kiln
dried
grain
with
a
faint
hint
of
earthy
must
taste
moved
in
quite
a
different
direction
from
scent
the
dominant
flavor
is
dry
stale
bread
but
without
the
yeasty
kick
the
background
has
minimal
notes
of
sour
over
rippened
fruit
and
lightly
toasted
grain
only
a
touch
of
honey
and
butter
the
lack
of
sweetness
leads
to
a
lingering
earthy
quality
medium
bodied
very
dry
on
palate
carbonation
active
for
most
of
glass
the
dry
breadyness
of
the
beer
did
not
work
that
well
with
the
perceived
over
rippened
fruit
notes
leaving
my
palate
somewhat
disapointed
especially
after
the
solid
nose
though
its
a
completely
different
beer
and
not
quite
in
the
same
league
arabier
reminds
me
of
orval
with
its
dryness
and
drinkability
great
stuff
pours
a
clear
golden
color
that
is
a
bit
dark
for
the
style
though
not
too
much
massive
white
head
with
some
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
bread
along
with
a
very
mild
yeast
presence
flavor
continues
like
this
its
simple
which
isnt
necessarily
a
problem
with
the
style
but
it
gets
the
proportions
wrong
the
taste
is
too
bready
without
any
of
the
light
stone
fruit
id
like
or
really
much
yeast
character
at
all
the
breadiness
makes
it
too
thick
and
chewy
and
theres
not
as
much
carbonation
as
id
like
with
that
said
its
still
a
wellmade
beer
that
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
again
overall
okay
its
interesting
enough
with
its
complexities
for
a
dose
and
a
bit
champagnelike
in
texture
filling
me
up
with
gas
so
i
can
skip
lunch
no
sir
there
will
be
no
need
of
panda
express
today
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
yellowamber
with
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
that
is
quite
frothy
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
be
careful
when
pouring
this
or
youll
get
foam
from
hell
to
breakfast
aroma
is
not
strong
but
it
is
pleasingly
malty
and
fruity
and
a
little
yeasty
fruity
malty
flavor
has
a
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
undertone
sublime
texture
is
silky
smooth
on
the
outside
and
lively
and
fizzy
on
the
inside
so
it
slides
down
the
pipes
easily
yet
leaves
a
nice
tingle
behind
love
them
belgians
o
not
a
very
good
beer
too
much

with
a
chalky
bitter
yeast
instead
of
having
a
nice
balance

im
a
little
surprised
at
the
floral
and
citrusy
hop
tastes
in
this
beer
its
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
as
well
the
backbone
of
this
brew
is
the
sharp
carbonic
bite
paired
with
a
gently
sweet
malt
following
close
behind
the
yeast
earthiness
rounds
out
this
great
example

glad
i

up
if
i
were
to
find
another

stashed
somewhere
i
will
definitely
pick
it
up
o
a
very
good
brew
that
ill
have
again
when
i
come
across
it
not
as
belgian
as
i
anticipated
it
being
but
very
good
nonetheless
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
liking
this
beer
more
and
more
as
i
sip
more
and
more
ill
certainly
be
willing
to
drink
this
one
again
so
long
as
it
is
relatively
fresh
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
very
balanced
and
well
made
that
it
is
a
real
treat
that
stands
out
from
the
field
of
strong
pale
ales
with
its
imaginative
combination
of
the
best
of
belgium
and
the
best
of
hops
o
delicious
it
seems
like
they
might
be
using
the
same
yeast
in
their
beers
giving
them
a
signature
yeasty
raspberryesque
flavor
that
works
really
well
with
their
maltycumsour
flavor
notes
the
hoppy
side
that
the
brew
talks
about
was
there
but
woven
maybe
subdued
given
the
uncertain
age
of
the
bottle
id
be
happy
to
find
another
one
and
compare
notes
though
this
was
quite
tasty
and
top
bracket
quality
wise
thanks
toño
for
the
treat
overall
a
real
treat
complex
enough
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
but
for
all
us
savages
who
need
food
with
beer
it
stood
up
to
chinese
without
batting
an
eye
looking
forward
to
having
again
when
the
weather
warms
up
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
great
traditional
style
characteristics
and
an
overall
tasty
experience
arabier
pours
somewhere
between
a
hazy
tangering
and
full
on

the
cream
colored
head
is
absolutely
towering
4
fingers
plus
after
pouring
only
about
half
the
bottle
retention
is
off
the
charts
15
minutes
later
theres
still
a
foam
iceberg
marooned
in
the
center
of
my
glass
lacing
is
pretty
good
but
more
spotty
than
cohesive
sheets
down
the
side
of
my
glass
and
just
keeps
the
look
from
being
about
perfect
the
nose
is
heavy
on
herbs
and
clove
with
a
bit
of
granny
smith
apples
and
pears
peeking
through
as
well
neither
the
bottle
or
the
de
dolle
website
mention
anything
about
brett
but
i
swear
theres
a
bit
of
funk
to
this
one
beyond
that
the
usual
pale
fruit
sweetness
leads
off
though
is
unusually
subdued
before
a
bigger
than
usual
hop
bite
leads
into
a
beautiful
blend
of
herbal
notes
from
the
nugget
hops
and
clove
and
white
pepper
phenols
from
the
yeast
a
little
bit
firmer
of
a
malt
presence
would
balance
the
beer
out
a
bit
more
and
really
elevate
it
even
further
i
dont
mind
my
bspas
being
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
id
say
arabier
takes
it
just
a
bit
too
far
theres
no
substance
to
it
at
all
bodywise
carbonation
is
quite
lively
and
spot
on
for
the
style
arabier
is
a
relatively
unique
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
were
it
not
quite
so
dry
would
be
up
there
with
duvel
as
a
top
offering
for
the
style
this
one
from
de
dolle
is
really
complex
and
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
pale
belgian
ales
this
bottle
says
its
8abv
not
7
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
frothy
head
that
doesnt
go
anywhere
anytime
fast
good
lookin
beer
scent
is
yeasty
spicy
and
fruity
i
get
oranges
apples
and
banana
the
orange
is
actually
predominant
in
the
nose
taste
is
somewhat
unique
in
its
own
way
tons
of
flavor
initially
i
get
a
hoppy
flavor
quickly
followed
by
delicious
banana
and
orange
flavors
then
i
get
some
bread
notes
and
tons
of
yeast
and
spice
a
lot
of
pepper
and
some
clove
it
finishes
very
hoppy
which
i
was
not
expecting
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
a
lot
of
flavor
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
the
abv
is
pretty
wellhidden
this
beer
is
nowhere
near
duvel
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
overall
this
beer
is
very
mediocre
do
i
have
a
bad
bottle
i
just
dont
see
the
appeal
at
all
here
jd
cap
is
stamped
bottled
may
2010
more
hops
and
bitter
notes
than
other
beers
in
this
style
enjoyable
d
as
with
everything
de
dolle
brews
i
enjoyed
this
theyre
a
seriously
under
appreciated
belgian
brewery
i
think
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
hoppier
offering
maybe
the
bottle
i
got
is
too
old
to
fully
appreciate
it
id
love
to
try
another
one
that
is
newer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
if
you
are
looking
something
with
dryness
and
lots
of
spicy
flavors
goes
down
smooth
at
first
with
the
decent
carbonation
but
it
fades
quick
as
it
warms
very
pleasant
to
drink
when
slightly
chilled
carbonated
not
so
much
as
it
warms
and
loses
it
d
this
beer
has
a
wellblended
complex
flavor
with
a
dry
but
fruity
and
hoppy
but
not
over
hoppy
flavor
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
did
not
last
long
enough
o
nice
belgian
which
should
be
drunk
in
the
summer
this
is
a
very
playfull
beer
it
tickles
your
tongue
and
gives
you
something
to
work
with
it
is
a
wide
spectrum
of
flavour
and
yet
so
well
balanced
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
over
all
feeling
is
very
warm
md
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
palate
and
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
d
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
a
bit
too
hoppy
mabye
considering
the
styel
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
interesting
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
with
medium
sized
midsoft
bubbles
slightly
unbalanced
to
the
bitter
side
maybe
storing
a
year
would
help
anyway
good
with
cheese
a
huge
beer
from
a
small
brewery
this
is
what
a
bspa
should
be
like
period
i
am
left
with
an
insane
feeling
of
wanting
to
try
de
dolles
other
offerings
like
oerbier
and
stille
nacht
till
then
i
will
continue
to
savour
my
small
booty
of
ara
bier
cheers
smack
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
it
makes
sense
that
this
is
sold
bottle
by
bottle
a
six
pack
might
be
a
bit
overwhelming
to
have
at
a
sitting
but
having
this
on
hand
in
a
cellar
would
be
a
good
idea
drinkability
this
is
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
by
far
the
hoppiest
and
most
bitter
bspa
ive
had
very
little
of
the
delicious
fruitiness
i
want
in
a
bspa
the
hops
drown
out
any
of
the
subtle
complexity
that
may
be
there
on
the
other
hand
stepping
back
and
tasting
this
as
a
belgian
ipa
id
probably
like
it
more
although
i
wasnt
really
in
love
with
the
hops
flavor
either
mouth
feel
is
very
bubbly
but
not
overly
solike
alka
seltzer
alcohol
is
hidden
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
d
a
lovely
take
on
a
belgian
pale
lots
of
character
and
a
pleasure
to
sip
this
is
one
ill
make
it
a
point
to
revisit
overall
a
decentcomplex
beer
but
not
really
in
a
good
way
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
finish
the
deal
compared
to
appearance
be
patient
with
the
pour
i
am
just
not
a
big
fan
of
de
dolle
i
guess
d
this
was
a
decent
tripel
but
its
taste
was
fairly
harsh
especially
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
it
was
still
tough
to
drink
since
the
aftertaste
was
so
sharp
there
wasnt
a
ton
of
depth
or
balance
either
on
the
plus
side
the
body
was
spot
on
ultimately
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
thats
probably
not
worth
trying
more
than
once
poured
this
one
and
id
say
about
three
fourths
of
my
tulips
is
head
this
beer
is
mostly
a
big
fluffy
white
head
on
top
of
a
straw
colored
beer
it
looks
nice
but
i
cant
even
pour
this
thing
the
head
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
and
all
in
all
it
really
took
me
about
ten
minutes
to
get
this
whole
thing
in
the
glass
no
biggie
though
smells
like
sweet
apples
and
i
can
really
smell
the
belgian
yeast
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
like
sweet
and
sour
apples
belgian
yeast
with
a
bitter
tart
finish
pretty
nice
for
a
medium
body
but
i
feel
like
de
dolle
over
carbonates
it
lowers
the
drinkability
for
me
and
at
7
percent
i
can
somehow
taste
the
alcohol
on
this
with
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
as
i
drink
it
the
drinkability
is
good
it
does
show
its
7
abv
but
i
dont
mind
its
a
wonderfully
unique
beer
that
may
come
up
short
in
some
ways
but
leaves
a
very
positive
impression
overall
drinkabilityvery
pleasant
and
easily
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
right
out
of
the
bottle
is
terrible
because
of
the
carbonation
bubbles
just
form
in
your
mouth
and
its
distracting
as
hell
after
20
minutes
in
the
duvel
glas
its
died
down
and
become
quite
creamy
in
the
middle
but
still
finishes
dry
thats
pretty
unique
and
im
enjoying
it
the
drinkability
is
just
above
average
mostly
due
to
the
alcohol
taste
and
the
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
effort
from
a
good
brewery
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
despite
its
overpowering
candied
sweetness
overall
enjoyable
pale
ale
good
taste
profile
with
plenty
of
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
though
the
palate
could
be
a
little
creamier
still
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
taste
follows
in
the
same
vein
although
it
is
a
bit
more
intense
than
a
duvel
yeast
presents
some
nice
ester
profiles
with
some
banana
pineapple
and
clove
flavors
plenty
of
tropical
alcohol
notes
and
the
hops
contribute
a
spicy
finish
and
grassy
flavor
throughout
it
all
comes
together
pretty
damn
nicely
another
good
beer
from
the
talented
folks
at
de
dolle
overall
a
great
belgium
brew
i
highly
recommend
it
d
this
is
a
cracking
belgian
pale
ale
and
you
will
struggle
to
beat
it
sour
apple
and
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
from
the
poperinge
dryhopping
wellbalanced
flavors
of
caramel
malt
bready
grains
musty
barnyard
yeast
and
light
citric
hops
are
delicately
interwoven
achieving
a
beer
that
is
engaging
yet
simple
this
is
my
first
from
de
dolle
has
me
really
looking
forward
to
their
oerbier
pours
a
cloudy
golden
brown
with
a
big
big
billowing
head
that
recedes
very
slow
highly
carbonated
the
smell
is
fruity
and
spice
whiffs
of
candy
some
whiffs
of
citrus
peel
yeast
a
little
coriander
the
taste
is
really
good
it
smokey
and
musty
a
little
peat
taste
mixed
with
fruit
and
spice
i
taste
raisins
some
pepper
there
is
alot
going
on
in
this
bspa
different
then
the
dozen
ive
had
in
this
style
but
props
to
the
complex
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
full
is
crisp
and
bitter
with
some
hops
but
is
earthy
and
finishes
dry
its
a
sipper
and
changes
as
it
warmsif
you
kike
bspas
seek
this
on
out
its
an
interesting
one
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
some
self
control
should
be
exerted
as
this
beer
is
so
complex
that
its
meant
to
sip
and
savor
an
excellent
beer
which
i
highly
recommend
thumbs
up
for
de
dolle
brouwers
again
what
does
de
dolle
add
to
this
beer
to
make
this
taste
the
way
it
does
its
worth
experimenting
with
if
you
want
a
different
bspa
note
label
says
8
abv
not
7
creamy
with
brown
patches
nose
quite
complex
blends
discreetly
smell
of
apple
and
apricot
the
bouquet
is
well
hopped
and
is
associated
with
a
drought
quite
powerful
it
is
both
bitter
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
apple
syrup
and
lemon
and
a
hint
of
butter
bitterness
is
also
a
remarkable
appearance
and
it
drags
in
the
mouth
with
a
pungent
most
welcome
like
other
beers
dolle
brouwers
it
offers
a
range
of
interesting
flavors
alcohol
hidden
well
but
a
heady
power
should
not
be
overlooked
drinkability
well
i
dont
know
if
it
is
me
or
my
bottle
but
that
was
tasty
i
would
definitely
recommend
grabbing
a
few
of
these
drinkability
pretty
good
but
a
little
harsh
this
would
probably
pair
well
with
a
curry
or
other
highly
flavorful
dish
this
could
definitely
stand
up
d
very
nice
beer
highly
enjoyable
complex
and
funky
small
bottle
but
a
big
beer
d
this
is
not
a
bspa
like
tremens
think
de
ranke
xx
bitter
only
better
for
my
palate
dry
hoppy
ipa
character
dominates
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
beer
d
drinks
excellent
my
only
prob
w
drinkability
is
the
amount
that
cascaded
onto
my
dresser
couldnt
be
salvaged
this
was
my
first
offering
from
the
de
dolle
brewers
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
check
out
some
of
their
other
offerings
d
this
is
a
big
and
aggressive
beer
the
yeast
character
is
wild
and
huge
so
much
so
that
it
threatens
to
obscure
the
subtleties
of
the
malt
and
hops
the
aroma
is
quite
well
balanced
with
appropriate
contributions
from
all
of
the
exceptional
aspects
of
the
beer
the
flavor
is
a
bit
less
controlled
with
a
huge
wave
of
sometimes
harsh
phenolic
yeast
flavors
that
threaten
but
dont
quite
succeed
to
wash
away
the
creamy
malt
and
atmospheric
hops
this
beer
walks
the
line
between
complexity
and
becoming
a
hot
mess
but
thankfully
it
just
barely
manages
to
land
on
the
side
of
excellence
in
the
end
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
didnt
come
in
a
750ml
bottle
and
that
i
will
have
a
hard
time
finding
more
of
it
a
wonderful
and
truly
unique
example
of
the
style
i
wish
there
were
more
like
it
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
i
think
the
bottling
date
was
on
the
top
of
the
cap
but
it
isnt
legible
i
dont
think
its
too
old
white
fluffy
long
lasting
foam
sits
atop
a
golden
beer
aroma
is
of
fresh
fruit
with
a
bit
of
funk
some
tartness
and
some
miscellaneous
sweetness
not
sure
what
it
is
but
i
know
its
good
waited
a
few
minutes
for
the
beer
to
warm
a
bit
and
the
head
to
reduce
so
i
didnt
get
foam
on
the
tip
of
my
nose
as
the
beer
warms
a
sweeter
honey
like
taste
and
smell
start
to
emerge
really
a
joy
to
drink
and
a
journey
of
the
senses
to
say
the
least
wow
md
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
good
carbonation
i
had
figured
it
was
going
to
be
over
carbonated
from
the
pour
but
i
was
wrong
bubbled
up
a
bit
in
my
mouth
but
only
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
could
drink
more
but
i
would
have
liked
it
a
bit
better
balanced
de
dolle
brouwers
yo
d
very
high
this
would
make
an
awesome
summer
beer
in
that
it
is
complex
and
tasty
yet
light
and
refreshing
interesting
drinkable
beer
another
good
example
of
a
belgian
blonde
sour
bought
at
a
nice
little
beer
store
in
bristol
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
meringue
head
that
lasts
forever
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
spicy
phenol
aroma
with
green
apples
lingering
in
the
background
also
some
alcohol
is
detected
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
yeast
flavors
cloves
and
pepper
up
front
with
some
apple
flavor
coming
in
towards
the
back
end
hop
bitterness
is
very
apparent
in
the
finish
as
well
which
i
guess
sets
this
one
apart
from
other
belgian
pale
ales
a
little
alcohol
warmth
is
also
noted
has
a
light
body
and
seems
a
little
overcarbonated
especially
right
after
the
pour
it
settles
down
a
little
with
time
but
still
a
little
high
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
i
would
still
take
duvel
over
this
one
cracking
the
cap
on
any
de
dolle
beer
is
always
a
pleasure
and
this
one
proved
to
be
no
different
depth
complexity
allure
uniqueness
its
got
it
all
have
had
this
one
several
times
over
the
years
and
this
is
surely
not
the
last
ive
seen
of
it
wowza
taste
is
fizzy
sour
malt
sweet
fruits
peach
and
apricot
ends
dry
a
little
sour
and
a
little
bitter
had
this
one
last
night
as
part
of
a
de
dolle
session
poured
a
golden
color
with
thick
frothy
white
head
that
faded
very
slowly
and
left
good
lacing
smelled
of
yeast
fruit
malt
and
toffee
tasted
of
fruits
yeast
sugar
and
caramel
a
bit
fizzy
and
dry
good
beer
upon
pouring
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
a
nice
golden
body
with
a
frothy
two
finger
head
it
smells
a
little
hoppy
kind
of
sweet
upon
sipping
it
it
tastes
of
fruits
candies
as
well
as
yeast
and
malts
and
in
the
end
it
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
its
carbonation
coming
through
along
with
its
sweetness
but
all
in
all
it
is
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
7
abv
beer
i
really
wish
that
i
had
another
right
now
damn
good
beer
overall
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
once
i
got
into
it
i
found
it
highly
unique
and
enjoyable
will
definitely
purchase
again
after
this
great
start
with
the
smell
and
look
i
was
greatly
disappointed
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
very
bitter
with
a
no
taste
of
orange
that
i
smelled
and
just
left
me
disappointed
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
distinctive
superior
version
of
the
style
though
one
of
the
more
subdued
offerings
from
de
dolle
overall
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
de
dolle
but
somewhat
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
but
the
flavors
dont
meld
as
seamlessly
as
they
do
in
de
dolles
other
beers
still
well
worth
a
shot
a
classic
beer
i
necessarily
shouldnt
take
points
for
this
but
it
pissed
me
off
as
it
was
my
first
brew
of
the
night
and
i
hate
waiting
for
that
first
one
poured
into
a
tulip
and
received
about
half
a
glass
of
foamy
white
head
that
took
forever
to
go
down
this
sat
on
top
of
a
tantalizing
gold
body
with
some
yeast
floaties
i
think
a
tart
citric
hop
smell
mixed
w
hints
of
something
spicy
like
clove
or
pepper
and
some
sweet
malt
smells
as
well
not
to
mention
that
typical
belgian
yeast
smell
w
the
hint
of
orange
a
mild
light
sweetness
mixed
with
some
tart
hops
that
pack
a
little
punch
on
the
backbite
a
complex
beer
as
i
was
going
back
and
forth
between
picking
up
these
bitter
tastes
and
sweet
tastes
as
this
beers
mouthfeel
seemed
to
vary
from
thin
and
sour
to
full
and
creamysmooth
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
ill
be
prepared
next
time
yum
times
a
thousand
i
love
belgian
beers
that
arent
too
sweet
so
the
belgian
ipa
category
is
usually
my
favorite
id
categorize
this
one
thusly
if
i
didnt
know
better
d
again
this
score
would
be
much
higher
if
the
mouthfeel
were
different
d
this
is
a
decent
bspa
it
is
well
put
together
and
is
definitely
a
unique
cool
interpretation
of
the
style
but
its
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
am
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
offered
by
a

generous

another
hits
from
this
brewery
i
have
seen
these
labels
for
many
years
and
avoided
them
because
i
just
didnt
know
a
lot
about
the
contents
in
searching
for
more
belgians
this
one
followed
me
home
and
i
am
glad
it
did
notes
for
the
price
my
store
has
it
at
its
fucking
amazing
love
this
brew
this
beer
was
an
absolute
treat
from
beginning
to
end
oh
to
have
a
case
of
these
at
hand
at
all
times
gives
any
of
the
tops
belgian
strong
ale
a
run
for
their
money
drinkability
this
beer
was
aged
for
a
few
years
in
my
cellar
and
is
drinking
beautifully
easily
my
favorite
beer
from
this
impressive

this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
ugly
brown
color
with
a
perfect
off
white
frothy
head
great
lacing
on
my
glass
baby
cakes
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
slight
oak
honey
light
sour
fruits
citrus
the
taste
is
grains
yeasty
citrus
malty
medium
bodied
medium
spritzy
carbo
decent
brew
from
de
dolle
ive
had
better
from
them
the
appearance
was
a
deep
cloudy
golden
orange
color
when
poured
it
yielded
a
decent
white
head
that
succeeds
in
not
disappearing
too
quickly
to
the
nose
this
beer
gives
off
scents
off
bread
and
citrus
namely
grapefruit
rind
when
i
took
a
small
swig
the
grapefruit
taste
wasnt
apparent
but
the
more
i
drank
the
stronger
the
grapefruit
taste
became
yet
it
still
has
a
little
breadiness
and
a
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
lends
itself
quite
splendidly
to
that
whole
grapefruit
beer
kind
of
taste
in
the
mouth
there
is
no
lack
of
carbonation
here
with
this
beer
i
think
its
pretty
light
in
weight
though
far
from
really
light
though
good
i
havent
drank
more
than
one
in
a
night
the
grapefruit
taste
is
good
but
not
something
i
want
to
taste
all
night
drinkability
is
high
this
is
such
a
great
beer
a
super
full
flavored
blond
so
right
up
my
alley
bier
like
this
is
why
de
dolle
is
one
of
the
best
period
would
be
great
with
dinner
or
a
few
just
to
relax
if
i
could
afford
it
i
would
drink
this
one
all
the
time
found
this
one
at
the
steelgaarden
in
bethlehem
pa
it
poured
a
fuzzy
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
full
offwhite
head
like
snow
and
chunks
of
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
a
sturdy
clove
and
grass
hop
a
nice
apetizing
blend
the
taste
brings
on
lively
bubblage
full
of
lightly
malted
lemony
wheat
clove
overall
and
a
dry
overtone
but
the
hop
presence
is
nice
in
a
bready
sort
of
way
very
fine
tingly
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
smooth
and
likeable
stuff
d
wish
i
had
another
d
a
definite
sipper
the
overflowing
head
makes
it
impossible
to
chug
this
or
down
it
in
10
minutes
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
this
is
a
pretty
flavorful
complex
ale
quite
enjoyable
and
something
id
be
glad
to
revisit
ahh
my
first
ara
since
having
it
on
draught
at
de
dolle
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brownorange
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
monster
of
a
white
head
the
nose
is
incredible
as
it
is
with
many
of
de
dolle
beers
big
floral
esters
mint
lemon
sweet
malts
and
subtle
but
detectable
hops
its
hard
to
define
the
taste
of
ara
so
crisp
and
refreshing
yeast
and
malt
invade
first
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
nice
flow
of
light
flavor
it
falls
off
midway
leaving
the
bright
fruitiness
and
moderate
hop
bite
it
sports
a
medium
body
with
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
amazing
brew
perfect
for
summertime
actually
this
is
drinkable
anytime
beware
of
the
burps
taste
completes
the
intial
triology
of
greatness
this
beer
presents
its
a
liquid
version
ofthe
nose
only
even
more
potent
the
peachflavor
explodes
right
up
front
followed
by
a
delicate
balance
of
hop
flowers
candi
sugars
and
coriander
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
it
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
but
sometimes
i
take
a
sip
and
think
its
perfect
the
next
too
sweet
i
did
however
highly
enjoy
this
beer
and
did
a
double
tasting
of
arabier
and
orabier
bspa
vs
bsda
quite
an
enjoyable
experience
this
is
a
perfect
combo
of
a
beer
thats
light
enough
to
knock
back
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
complex
enough
to
savor
great
stuff
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
carbonation
formed
in
the
bottle
immediately
after
popping
the
cap
resulting
in
a
slight
overflow
pours
a
murky
dark
orangish
color
with
some
yeast
floating
around
this
is
definitely
a
slow
pour
with
a
massive
head
forming
from
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
fruits
mainly
apples
and
pears
with
a
touch
of
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
has
a
peppery
spiciness
to
it
with
a
dose
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
and
very
heavily
carbonated
overall
de
dolle
ara
bier
is
an
interesting
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
there
is
a
really
strong
medicinal
aftertaste
that
turns
me
off
to
it
it
is
worth
a
shot
for
its
uniqueness
but
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
again
ara
bier
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
and
the
abnormally
intense
hop
character
really
provided
a
refreshing
fun
twist
to
this
classic
style
not
the
best
from
de
dolle
but
another
solid
pick
from
their
lineup
something
refreshingly
light
and
summerish
about
it
despite
the
complexities
the
abv
is
reasonably
wellcovered
pricey
at
over
5
bucks
for
the
small
bottle
but
a
treat
to
sip
on
especially
on
a
warm
day
perfectly
drinkable
i
think
i
found
a
new
favorite
not
a
bad
beer
and
would
have
again
the
taste
is
full
of
spices
mustiness
dead
grass
and
yeast
taste
starts
off
with
lots
of
yeast
then
changes
to
a
kind
of
clove
with
citrus
and
spice
the
finish
is
sort
of
sweet
bitter
interesting
beer
an
exceptional
beer
from
de
dolle
one
of
my
favorites
ive
only
had
this
brew
one
time
before
and
only
purchased
it
this
time
to
review
it
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
unless
i
am
brewing
a
bspa
and
want
a
little
inspiration
mediumfull
body
and
huge
lush
carbonation
leads
to
a
classically
and
exquisitely
foamyfilling
belgianstyle
mouthfeel
for
sure
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
another
very
good
brew
from
de
dolle
although
probably
my
least
favourite
of
the
ones
ive
tried
definitely
worth
a
try
though
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
palm
tavern
in
milwaukee
served
in
a
tulip
appears
a
pale
gold
with
a
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
apples
and
subtle
herbal
spice
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malts
with
with
a
touch
of
apples
and
white
grapes
finishes
with
mellow
grassy
hops
and
a
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
initial
sweetness
i
find
the
carbonation
a
little
much
strong
enough
that
it
gets
hard
to
taste
the
beer
and
once
the
carbonation
did
die
down
big
bandaid
and
medicinal
phenols
took
over
the
aroma
i
really
dug
the
hoppy
aftertaste
but
the
phenols
and
carbonation
turn
me
off
a
complex
beer
flavor
doesnt
quite
finish
the
deal
compared
to
appearance
and
nose
but
an
enjoyable
belgian
of
distinction
be
patient
with
the
pour
11
2
oz
bottle
copped
singly
from
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
this
one
is
obviously
less
intense
and
overthetop
than
other
de
dolle
beers
that
ive
sampled
very
similar
to
their
bos
keun
really
liked
this
one
an
excellent
depiction
of
the
style
bursting
with
flavor
and
taste
nice
golden
hazy
and
cloudy
appearance
with
a
decent
frothy
and
foamy
head
great
citrus
smell
with
fresh
tropical
fruits
and
florals
terrific
taste
bursting
with
candies
sugars
caramel
and
vanilla
very
thick
rich
and
fullbodied
de
dolle
specializes
in
ultrathick
creamy
rich
beers
and
this
one
certainly
fits
the
bill
if
youre
looking
for
a
thick
fullflavored
beer
look
no
further
than
this
one
outstanding
creamy
mouthfeel
with
an
easy
drinkability
7
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smooth
crisp
and
clean
another
winner
from
de
dolle
definitely
recommended
quite
easy
to
drink
another
wonderful
dolle
creation
incidentally
it
matched
chinese
potstickers
not
spicy
very
well
d
a
decent
brew
but
was
expecting
more
from
this
brewery
drinkable
but
only
moderately
enjoyable
after
having
the
export
stout
about
a
year
ago
and
really
enjoying
it
i
have
seen
this
breweries
other
brews
on
the
shelf
and
decided
to
pick
on
of
them
up
to
give
it
a
try
the
one
i
decided
on
and
not
100
certain
why
was
this
ara
bier
the
brew
poured
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
distinct
brown
hue
the
pour
gave
a
huge
head
that
filled
the
glass
perfectly
with
the
end
of
the
pour
producing
a
good
amount
of
yeast
particles
the
aroma
had
a
number
of
properties
that
came
out
to
me
nice
fruit
apple
and
pear
maybe
more
than
a
slight
earthy
barnyard
smell
and
spices
that
seem
to
be
mostly
clove
the
aroma
was
also
pretty
good
as
the
fruit
notes
seem
to
come
out
more
as
i
seem
to
pick
up
more
apple
along
with
a
sweet
sensation
probably
from
the
malts
has
what
i
would
classify
as
a
slight
hop
start
to
it
very
mild
and
goes
away
quickly
to
the
sweet
flavor
described
above
overall
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
brew
not
my
favorite
but
it
was
a
nice
change
to
the
normal
stuff
i
have
been
having
i
would
get
this
one
again
in
the
future
surprising
that
it
is
at
7
as
i
did
not
pick
up
much
in
the
way
of
alcohol
notes
sticking
out
somehow
ive
never
had
this
beer
before
even
though
ive
seen
it
for
years
and
enjoyed
other
de
dolle
beers
i
must
say
that
this
one
is
just
bizarre
i
read
an
earlier
review
that
described
this
as
overly
phenolic
i
have
to
agree
wholeheartedly
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
like
a
hefeweizen
in
color
but
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
pillows
into
hills
and
valleys
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
funky
slightly
sour
and
quite
clovey
this
is
just
a
touch
of
medicinal
funk
as
well
the
taste
is
shocking
starts
slightly
sour
and
a
bit
sweet
and
quickly
transitions
into
bandaids
burnt
plastic
wood
and
a
smokiness
on
the
finish
in
a
way
it
is
weirdly
fascinating
but
ultimately
it
is
hard
to
stomach
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
quite
carbonated
and
soft
and
creamy
with
the
jolt
of
all
that
carbonation
keeping
it
lively
it
does
improve
somewhat
as
it
warms
but
the
medicinal
flavors
are
stronger
than
any
other
ive
ever
tasted
ultimately
im
barely
able
to
keep
taling
sips
of
this
to
review
and
i
cant
say
im
enjoying
it
i
think
this
is
one
that
gets
worse
with
age
d
a
special
beer
to
sip
the
warmth
in
my
stomach
tells
me
so
d
very
enjoyable
but
suffers
slightly
from
its
excess
of
drying
spices
definitely
a
beer
to
be
savoured
slowly
calling
this
beer
a
pale
is
kind
of
a
stretch
in
fact
anything
but
a
biere
de
garde
would
be
a
misclassification
this
is
one
weird
beer
a
very
woodsy
nutty
fruity
dirty
musty
character
chases
this
beer
throughout
at
times
robbing
it
of
sweetness
but
adding
a
ton
of
comlexity
aromas
are
boarderline
barnyard
dusty
and
like
grandmas
attic
flavors
are
less
funky
but
more
woodsy
tart
and
full
of
rotten
fruits
the
yeast
bacteria
has
stripped
the
beer
of
much
of
its
sweetness
and
body
but
the
other
complex
flavors
textures
and
aromas
compensate
well
the
beer
has
an
overwhelming
phenolic
character
that
passes
plastic
and
medicinal
notes
and
well
into
a
smoky
scorched
flavor
finishes
as
muddles
as
the
flavors
with
the
lowlying
sweetness
going
first
and
a
tart
cheesy
flavor
lingering
its
basically
an
alcoholic
mud
puddle

very
drinkable
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
beer
haha
that
one
goes
out
to
you
born
around
1980
listened
to
crappy
music
in
middle
school
and
know
the
names
of
the
brewers
for
this
company
love
this
brewery
hazy
honey
with
a
white
head
that
settles
into
a
floating
island
of
solid
creamy
goodness
leaving
tons
of
lace
as
it
does
so
nose
is
lemon
honey
herbal
tea
and
maybe
a
touch
of
dried
apricot
to
me
taste
is
lemon
up
front
followed
by
buttery
herbal
tea
with
a
touch
of
honey
proper
medium
body
although
i
wish
it
was
a
touch
creamier
i
was
worried
from
the
typical
humongous
de
dolle
head
that
it
would
be
overly
carbonated
but
this
one
was
about
just
right
dangerously
drinkable
im
trying
to
savor
but
its
just
so
difficult
another
please
d
its
drinkability
is
rather
low
due
to
its
high
alcohol
taste
and
complex
medley
of
flavours
which
should
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
d
good
borderline
excellent
i
liked
this
beer
but
wished
the
drier
qualities
were
balanced
a
little
more
with
some
sweetness
then
again
thats
my
preference
only
a
likable
beer
id
definitely
have
again
great
gold
color
with
a
strong
head
if
micro
bubbles
appetizingly
dry
the
alcohol
is
present
but
dances
well
with
the
yeast
its
listed
as
8
on
the
de
dolle
website
not
the
7
listed
here
crisp
finish
one
of
the
few
de
dolle
brews
ill
go
back
to
would
drink
it
everyday
if
possible
but
no
more
than
2
at
a
time
superb
sure
its
smooth
but
not
drinkable
at
all
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
but
the
other
reviewers
found
many
of
the
same
flavors
i
found
highly
recommended
another
wonderful
example
of
de
dolle
taking
a
common
style
and
adding
their
own
unique
twist
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
rather
spritzy
with
carbonation
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
from
de
dolle
nothing
like
what
i
was
expecting
much
stronger
hop
presence
than
expected
goes
nicely
with
the
other
flavors
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
the
other
de
dolles
i
have
in
the
fridge
this
is
a
solid
hoppy
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
is
a
little
less
sweet
than
some
others
and
the
bold
hop
profile
nearly
renders
this
pleasing
brew
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
in
my
opinion
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
a
somewhat
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
an
enjoyable
and
almost
sessionlike
belgian
beer
d
not
great
the
flavor
isnt
pleasant
it
just
has
too
much
much
pepper
to
be
enjoyable
it
smells
nice
though
fantastic
strong
pale
ale
from
a
brewery
that
rarely
disappoints
i
love
their
sense
of
experimentation
and
originality
in
their
beers
give
me
a
bottle
of
this
over
duvel
any
day
overall
i
like
this
one
very
much
thank
you
overall
its
funky
semisweet
slightly
odd
but
this
one
is
a
pioneer
for
some
of
the
funked
out
emulations
that
we
now
find
brewed
in
the
u
s

ill
go
out

get
it
again

well
worth
seeking
out

a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
carries
with
it
a
powerful
pear
presence
some
chewiness
by
midsip
with
a
strong
sensation
of
yeast
finish
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
d
because
of
the
price
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
of
the
time
but
every
once
in
a
while
its
nice
to
get
a
single
to
sip
and
savour
d
good
beer
becomes
much
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
fairly
original
d
i
could
polish
off
a
750
of
this
no
problem
a
very
good
brew
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
huge
head
of
white
bubbles
aroma
is
spicy
and
dusty
a
hint
of
apple
taste
is
light
with
hints
of
grain
faint
grass
and
perhaps
some
bubblegum
way
in
the
back
the
grass
becomes
more
sharp
as
i
drink
very
dry
drinkable
but
not
my
choice
for
belgian
strong
pale
ales
just
too
sharp
on
the
grass
drinkability
very
complex
and
very
easy
to
drink
equals
a
deadly
combination
however
i
still
wouldnt
really
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
certainly
worth
a
shot
and
very
nice
in
the
summer
weather
for
a
sipper
33cl
bottle
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
the
slowly
rising
column
of
foam
in
the
neck
of
the
bottle
it
poured
into
the
glass
with
quite
the
frothy
white
head
of
foam
it
did
linger
for
a
little
while
and
did
leave
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
pleasant
spiciness
is
the
first
aroma
that
you
detect
this
is
followed
by
some
breadiness
and
a
whiff
of
some
fruitiness
it
is
a
little
effervescent
on
the
tongue
that
seems
to
limit
the
ability
to
taste
the
beer
i
do
get
hints
of
sour
apples
and
a
faint
hint
of
caramel
malt
spiciness
is
evident
an
interesting
beer
i
like
this
offering
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
what
a
wonderfull
beer
strong
fullbodied
and
not
too
sweet
and
complex
recommended
in
a
word
creamy
yeast
with
strong
carbonation
tasty
honeyish
and
on
sweet
side
but
carbonation
on
mouth
detracted
rather
one
dimensional
on
yeast
some
clove
tea
spice
some
orange
citrus
drinkable
did
not
get
much
from
dry
hopping
a
nice
one
drinkability
the
bitterness
is
an
issue
here
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
bitter
beers
under
certain
circumstances
but
this
beer
surpasses
so
many
others
with
its
other
characteristics
that
it
might
not
matter
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
some
american
pales
like
sn
with
a
bit
more
of
a
sweetfruity
kick
after
the
oerbier
my
favorite
de
dolle
brew
d
fantastic
beer
easily
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
beers
in
fact
its
one
of
my
favourite
beers
full
stop
overall
a
good
quite
interesting
beer
but
not
something
that
blows
my
mind
well
worth
a
try
though
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
not
one
of
my
favorites
though
taste
has
a
lot
of
apple
in
it
as
well
with
some
nice
candied
overtones
and
yeasty
belgian
flavors
not
particularly
bold
the
flavor
is
very
good
but
fairly
subdued
good
god
i
need
more
more
more
more
everything
that
is
wrong
with
the
world
can
be
summed
up
from
my
lack
of
this
beer
everything
that
is
wrong
with
me
everything
that
is
wrong
with
you
everything
that
is
wrong
with
mother
the
7
abv
is
almost
undetectable
good
sour
qualities
and
sweetened
fruit
flavors
another
well
brewed
offering
from
de
dolle
an
all
around
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
thick
opaque
peach
color
with
a
hint
of
brown
makes
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
light
floral
aroma
with
notes
of
coriander
and
cloves
flavor
is
complex
with
fruits
and
lightly
spiced
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
medium
on
the
palate
creamy
texture
and
finishes
dry
a
rather
good
strong
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
alcohol
content
is
very
subdued
by
the
complexity
in
the
flavors
i
would
try
this
one
again
overall
after
the
first
sip
i
must
admit
i
thought
i
was
gonna
be
givin
this
beer
an
average
rating
didnt
take
long
for
me
to
reconsider
very
tasty
brew
especially
as
it
warms
get
yourself
some
a
hyperactive
explosion
of
white
mousse
turns
rigid
and
chunky
the
color
below
is
blurry
blond
satisfying
rich
vanilla
and
cream
sensations
are
evident
on
the
nose
along
with
flamboyant
impressions
of
citrus
filling
dusty
white
pepper
and
minerals
i
like
the
even
split
between
hard
core
peach
pitflavored
bitterness
and
farmers
market
flavors
of
herbs
grass
lemon
oil
and
root
vegetables
the
finish
is
persistent
with
that
same
mixture
the
yeasts
are
a
little
unruly
here
nice
very
flavourful
and
complex
ale
with
a
powerful
yeast
character
and
beautifully
rounded
body
bottle
hazy
but
luminescent
orange
with
a
huge
merangue
like
white
head
that
lasted
admirably
and
left
heaps
of
lace
behind
aroma
is
hoppy
citrus
with
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
and
a
little
belgian
yeasty
funk
taste
is
dry
at
first
with
a
little
malty
sweetness
but
dominated
by
a
big
finish
of
spice
and
hop
bitterness
completely
hiding
the
reasonably
high
abv
also
noted
a
slight
off
latex
taste
mouth
is
light
and
a
little
course
for
me
not
up
to
the
oerbier
unfortunately
although
i
am
sure
i
will
get
plenty
of
disagreement
i
found
the
hops
to
be
a
nice
break
from
your
standard
offerings
in
the
style
with
much
more
gusto
than
some
another
topnotch
offering
from
de
dolle
i
may
be
prejudiced
for
de
dolle
but
this
is
another
quality
offering
and
at
7
abv
it
doesnt
seem
so
until
it
hits
you
of
course
im
glad
i
read
that
this
beer
poured
with
a
volumnous
head
i
decided
to
utilize
the
gulden
draak
goblet
for
this
one
it
did
pour
up
a
huge
rocky
bone
white
head
atop
a
golden
colored
beer
lightly
honeyed
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pear
light
hoppiness
and
overall
clean
smelling
with
a
light
yeast
mustiness
introduction
of
lees
attributes
a
mild
spiciness
trace
amounts
of
a
medicinal
quality
but
nothing
severely
off
slightly
sweet
and
an
herbal
hoppy
finish
that
is
rather
sedate
yet
noticable
very
refined
and
elegant
for
some
odd
reason
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
surely
was
not
disappointed
a
very
tasty
pale
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
spritzy
finely
tuned
and
highly
recommended
one
of
the
better
belgian
pales
ive
had
recently
ara
bier
is
a
bspa
that
fits
neatly
into
the
bitterdry
end
of
the
style
spectrum
its
wellmade
id
expect
nothing
less
from
brouwerij
de
dolle
but
it
doesnt
quite
push
all
of
my
buttons
okay
it
doesnt
push
them
firmly
its
worth
a
repeat
purchase
though
and
is
definitely
worth
a
look
if
you
happen
to
run
across
a
bottle
drinkability
almost
like
a
belgian
ipa
ineresting
and
different
very
drinkable
may
get
this
one
again
next
time
i
go
shopping
pours
a
hazy
peahlike
color
with
just
a
volcanic
head
that
took
over
most
of
my
tulip
glass
leaving
nice
sheets
of
lace
behindbig
pinapple
aroma
from
the
offset
with
some
clovey
spiciness
and
a
little
cinnamon
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
along
with
the
aroma
has
a
strong
pinapple
character
with
a
big
yeastyspiciness
in
there
as
wellas
it
warms
a
little
the
alcohol
pops
up
more
along
with
some
light
mineral
qualities
glad
to
try
this
beer
very
well
made
with
some
subtle
complexities
i
really
like
the
fruitiness
to
it
will
love
to
have
again
the
taste
is
wonderful
pretty
sweet
almost
like
apple
juice
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
added
in
the
aftertaste
gets
a
little
bitter
and
the
slight
feeling
of
carbonation
lingers
for
a
little
while
but
the
smoothness
of
the
initial
sip
really
begs
for
another
as
you
have
more
and
more
the
aftertaste
starts
to
go
away
and
you
are
left
with
only
the
sweet
start
a
great
beer
for
any
occasion
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
yellow
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
yeast
with
some
spices
and
hops
also
noticeable
taste
is
quite
sharp
with
again
the
yeast
making
a
lot
of
impression
and
spices
with
strong

being
quite
evident
strong

with
some
good

wow
this
brewery
seems
to
always
be
amazing
another
wonderful
concoction
from
de

brouwers
terrific
appearance
an
attracting
hazy
golden
with
a
gigantic
white
head
displaying
splendid
lacing
the
head
leaves
a
trace
after
every
sip
and
just
stays
there
mountainous
rocky
all
over
the
glass
sediments
move
at
the
bottome
of
the
glass
appealing
yeasty
sweet
aroma
honeyish
malt
is
the
base
on
which
dances
an
above
average
hop
character
for
a
belgian
beer
citrusy
lemony
sprucey
notes
of
bread
farmhouse
apple
and
peppercloves
i
expected
this
to
be
the
least
interesting
de
dolle
but
how
wrong
i
was
this
one
is
fabulous
complex
yeasty
balanced
refreshing
and
almost
a
session
beer
palate
is
dry
up
front
hoppy
with
a
generous
bitter
finish
but
all
kinds
of
things
happening
in
between
theres
a
subdued
fruitiness
in
the
likes
of
grapefruit
apple
orange
or
apricot
and
complex
complementing
spices
refreshing
mild
tart
profile
great
creamy
and
velvety
mouthfeel
with
above
average
carbonation
i
just
played
a
few
hours
of
tennis
and
this
is
a
superb
sunny
day
welcome
the
complex
toasty
almost
pilsnerish
malt
just
seduces
me
all
the
ingredients
in
this
beer
makes
themselves
heard
and
known
oh
plentiful
harvest
how
i
want
to
live
to
drink
your
offerings
again
thank
you
for
enlighting
me
sham
a
super
solid
sipper
not
as
drinkable
as
most
other
de
dolle
treats
but
approachable
and
pleasant
non
the
less
easily
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
up
i
enjoy
the
dulle
teve
by
a
good
margin
more
along
with
bos
keun
for
de
dolle
classics
but
this
still
would
be
something
to
have
again
no
prob
it
grows
on
ya
yert
again
gclarkage
youre
the
man
thank
you
for
sending
this
one
my
way
poured
into
rapscallion
glass
where
it
formed
a
big
fluffy
2
bright
white
head
over
the
golden
light
amber
brew
head
is
dense
and
doesnt
seem
to
be
going
anywhere
quick
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
peaches
perhaps
with
a
light
undercurrent
of
alcohol
taste
is
initially
spicy
with
some
rounding
out
with
pale
malts
and
sharpens
up
with
some
hops
bite
amongst
other
varied
flavors
a
busy
set
of
taste
buds
on
this
one
mouthfeel
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
but
eventually
becomes
somewhat
addicting
drinkability
is
good
for
the
main
reason
that
you
must
revisit
to
make
sure
no
flavors
were
missed
or
overlooked
drinkability
is
below
average
for
this
style
i
would
not
buy
this
again
on
tap
at
redbones
in
late
august
after
every
sip
i
said
this
is
crazy
even
at
the
end
of
night
of
hop
slugs
and
hot
sauce
insanely
complex
yet
pleasant
and
damn
drinkable
spicy
sweet
tart
other
flavors
all
in
turns
please
redbones
bring
this
one
back
this
will
be
my
first
de
dolle
beer
and
i
am
excited
the
beer
pours
from
a
11
6
oz
bottle
yellowish
tan
in
color
with
a
huge
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
clean
and
citrusy
with
hints
of
something
grassy
very
effervesant
the
taste
is
much
stronger
than
i
expected
the
grassyness
starts
to
come
through
even
more
in
the
taste
you
get
a
hint
of
some
alchol
at
the
end
as
well
not
as
balanced
as
i
expected
i
cant
get
over
how
huge
the
head
is
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
something
in
between
an
orval
and
a
duvel
very
good
just
very
different
11
2
ounce
bottle
i
was
really
disappointed
by
this
brew
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
huge
rocky
head
aroma
was
sweet
with
apple
lemon
and
malt
i
was
disappointed
most
of
all
by
the
taste
as
the
tartness
was
just
overpowering
and
didnt
match
the
aroma
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
grainy
and
phenolic
i
detected
some
charcoal
and
metallic
notes
as
well
that
were
rather
unpleasant
mouthfeel
was
prickly
which
matches
this
style
fairly
well
and
grows
smoother
with
every
mouthful
this
is
certainly
my
least
favorite
offering
from
de
dolle
mellow
soft
but
very
hoppy
and
delicious
fruitiness
mainly
peach
and
tangerine
incredible
balanced
and
very
pleasant
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
another
one
i
brought
back
from
beermania
nice
yellow
bow
tie
on
the
bottle
huge
soft
fluffy
airy
persistant
head
in
the
goblet
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
lots
of
bubble
density
spicy
cloves
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
lemon
inital
taste
of
lemon
and
dry
pinapple
followed
up
with
a
grassy
slightly
bitter
finish
quite
smooth
on
the
mouth
and
tongue
solid
smooth
and
drinkable
pours
surprisingly
clear
unless
you
try
to
get
every
drop
then
you
get
some
nice
yeasty
bits
golden
amber
with
a
huge
thick
white
head
incredibly
thick
head
took
me
a
few
minutes
to
get
it
all
in
the
glass
to
control
a
head
that
ended
up
thick
as
foamed
milk
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
pears
and
banana
shine
through
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
with
some
sourness
at
the
finish
and
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
very
light
on
the
tongue
flavor
and
intense
excited
carbonation
fill
the
mouth
completely
the
mouthfeel
is
champagne
like
light
and
airy
mouthfilling
a
great
summery
beer
that
satisfies
and
brings
on
a
craving
for
another
sampled
12204
a
careful
pour
from
a
longstanding
bottle
delivers
a
clear
yellowgold
body
beneath
a
huge
head
of
rocky
white
foam
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
wide
sheets
of
thin
lace
about
the
glass
if
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
is
disturbed
however
it
becomes
a
hazy
marmalade
but
at
the
same
time
delivers
more
flavor
via
the
yeast
the
bright
nose
is
yeasty
floral
subtly
fruity
delicately
spicy
cloves
and
welcoming
some
acetaldehdye
green
apple
and
candyish
notes
from
a
combination
of
phenols
and
sweet
malt
arise
as
it
warms
a
very
fine
effervescent
carbonation
is
achieved
through
bottle
conditioning
and
combines
with
its
medium
body
to
leave
it
gently
zesty
on
the
tongue
before
warming
to
become
velvety
smooth
across
the
tongue
the
flavor
delivers
fruitiness
and
hints
at
tartness
upfront
before
a
honeyish
and
mildly
nutty
maltiness
and
spicy
grassy
leafy
and
floral
hop
flavor
becomes
apparent
its
bright
hoppiness
is
quite
a
twist
on
the
standard
belgian
golden
strong
ale
style
bitterness
rises
towards
the
finish
and
lingers
dryly
in
the
long
aftertaste
amidst
a
smattering
of
grassy
hops
and
phenols
an
interesting
and
exciting
beer
a
white
grapefruit
bitterness
along
with
orange
zest
provides
a
nice
sharp
edge
coriander
cloves
and
peppery
spices
seem
to
unify
the
different
tastes
a
warming
alcohol
is
a
welcome
flavor
and
sensation
partner
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
this
cloudy
golden
beer
has
a
huge
rocky
head
that
just
wont
quit
there
are
some
fruity
esters
in
the
aroma
that
smells
of
apples
it
is
delicate
and
spicy
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
it
is
complex
and
refreshing
and
everything
that
an
artisanal
beer
should
be
a
nice
looking
beer
with
an
interesting
aroma
but
a
onedimensional
and
not
very
appealing
taste
aftertaste
very
bitter
fresh
and
herbal
a
lot
of
long
standing
bitterness
this
beer
can
be
really
strangely
bitter
when
its
fresh
see
above
bracketed
comments
but
after
a
year
or
more
of
proper
cellarage
it
becomes
much
more
balanced
based
on
this
i
have
increased
my
rating
of
it
it
will
likely
be
at
its
prime
with
a
years
storage
under
its
belt
turbo
charged
carbonation
produces
a
beer
that
is
golden
in
colour
with
a
monstrous
head
and
thick
rocky
rings
of
lace
very
pleasant
aroma
of
mixed
tart
tropical
fruits
backed
by
that
underlying
slightly
sour
yeast
smell
very
pleasing
tastes
in
this
one
refreshing
fruits
followed
by
a
bit
of
woodiness
a
brew
probably
meant
for
summertime
consumption
rather
than
december
smooth
but
lively
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
despite
the
presence
of
some
stern
alcohol
notes
a
very
good
beer
all
around
and
one
of
the
better
belgians
ive
tried
ill
probably
get
another
one
of
these
to
rereview
and
get
more
specific
about
a
little
different
but
well
worth
a
try
a
hazy
orange
color
it
is
very
well
carbonated
and
it
produces
a
thick
white
head
it
has
a
spicy
dry
slightly
funky
cheese
aroma
the
carbonation
prickles
the
front
of
my
tongue
as
i
take
a
sip
a
very
spicy
funky
belgian
brew
lightly
sweet
in
the
finish
which
ultimately
ends
with
an
astringent
aftertaste
fruity
with
perhaps
some
tropical
fruit
notes
a
certain
woodiness
is
in
this
beer
as
well
i
get
notes
of
some
wildwoody
mushroom
type
character
as
well
there
is
no
acidic
sourness
in
this
beer
unlike
some
of
there
other
offerings
very
good
and
quite
complex
it
is
amazing
how
good
the
beers
from
this
small

malt
a
little
different
flavor
is
marked
by
a
hard
to
descibe
maltiness
present
with
decent
body
but
counteracted
by
a
considerable
bitterness
a
onetwo
of
citric
pith
drying
to
pine
needles
whew
cant
say
this
one
is
a
favorite
but
an
arid
and
bitter
alternative
to
the
thick
and
malty
brews
very
much
worth
trying
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
update
retasted
in
2004
and
picked
up
a
lot
bigger
belgian
hop
balance
along
with
shades
of
sourness
i
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
more
and
raised
this
category
as
well
as
drinkability
by

5
my
records
indicate
that
this
particular
sample
was
bottled
around
2000
nonetheless
it
pours
a
hazed
peach
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
some
yeast
remnants
float
in
the
beautiful
liquid
nose
is
almost
entirely
gueuzelike
big
notes
of
sour
acidity
horse
blanket
and
earthy
hops
lead
the
way
in
the
aromatic
department
herbal
earthy
hops
citrus
and
passion
fruit
along
with
a
refreshing
acidity
quality
are
all
present
on
the
palate
wellattenuated
and
aging
nicely
this
ales
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
appealing
drinks
quite
well
for
a
brew
of
7
abv
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
taste
this
is
a
great
unique
summertime
beer
albeit
the
hefty
alcohol
content
that
will
eventually
catch
up
to
you
no
matter
how
well
its
masked
another
excellent
belgian
ale
nasty
nasty
nasty
taste
to
this
one
the
bartender
who
i
know
is
knowledgable
about
beer
said
it
sucked
when
i
ordered
it
i
decided
to
go
for
it
anyway
since
i
figured
one
would
be
an
experience
if
nothing
else
it
started
out
as
a
cloudy
blondish
colored
brew
with
an
enormous
head
had
an
odd
smell
a
little
bit
like
honey
but
with
a
strange
unpleasant
odor
vying
for
attention
the
taste
actually
reminded
me
initially
of
chimay
white
but
then
this
nasty
aftertaste
barges
in
that
totally
overloads
the
tastebuds
the
bartender
afterwards
gave
me
a
chimay
goblet
to
atone
beware
the
foam
with
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
an
enormous
growing
head
unreal
how
much
foam
this
has
even
with
a
good
pour
the
head
stays
thick
throughout
and
causes
the
top
portion
of
the
beer
to
have
an
odd
dark
hue
even
though
the
head
is
white
the
aroma
for
this
one
had
a
lot
of
spices
and
hops
in
it
with
some
small
hints
of
yeast
the
flavor
was
very
tart
and
spicy
with
the
alcohol
being
far
too
prominent
for
only
having
7
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
possibly
influenced
by
the
fact
that
it
foamed
over
onto
my
table
more
than
once
11
6
oz
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
and
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
some
hops
taste
is
lightly
tart
and
crisp
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
almost
like
a
lambic
but
with
a
more
complex
flavor
very
enjoyable
this
brew
poured
a
small
white
head
with
small
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
this
brew
left
a
fair
lacing
on
all
sides
of
my
glass
the
body
was
cloudy
and
straw
yellow
in
hue
it
had
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
along
with
a
citrus
aroma
it
had
an
initial
sour
flavor
that
was
still
there
at
the
end
the
body
was
light
on
the
palate
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
belgian
and
belgian
strong
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
brew
it
was
the
label
that
attracted
me
that
bird
looked
so
cute
and
it
had
cat
s
written
on
it
it
poured
a
carbonated
orangish
yellow
it
tasted
almost
like
a
lambic
imho
tart
i
swear
i
could
taste
an
overwhelming
cherry
taste
i
found
this
beer
quite
different
i
think
one
a
session
is
more
than
enough
this
one
poured
a
nice
looking
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
the
head
was
white
and
craggy
like
a
big
iceberg
on
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
spicy
with
some
medicinal
undertones
and
traces
of
ripe
cherry
the
taste
is
on
the
tart
side
and
just
a
bit
mouthpuckering
unfortunately
the
taste
of
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
too
pronounced
for
a
7
0
beer
which
detracts
from
the
drinkability
pours
a
bright
light
amber
turned
cloudy
after
i
had
room
for
a
second
pour
a
stormy
blizzard
of
streaming
bubbles
feed
a
growing
head
that
can
be
touched
and
will
spring
back
into
shape
flavor
is
bright
and
crisp
but
still
complex
honey
apples
apricots
and
the
faintest
hint
of
pecans
there
is
a
surprising
hop
bitterness
for
a
belgian
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
aroma
impresses
also
heady
and
vibrant
buzzing
with
spice
and
spritzes
of
citrus
loads
of
malt
in
the
body
but
jampacked
with
hops
above
all
excellent
integration
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
citrus
with
a
dedicated
yeastiness
riding
throughout
the
finish
is
sweet
and
brief
but
the
hoppy
zing
at
the
front
provided
for
a
very
pleasurable
experience
an
excellent
bier
and
i
have
johnyduvel
to
thank
for
it
a
big
thank
you
goes
out
to
steview
for
including
this
gem
in
our
blockbuster
trade
the
aroma
is
very
nice
hoppy
piney
musty
citric
my
guess
is
that
this
beer
tips
the
spectrum
on
the
high
side
for
hop
load
for
this
style
this
is
a
nice
tasting
belgian
brew
probably
my
favorie
of
this
brewery
of
which
ive
also
tasted
stille
nacht
and
oerbier
the
must
and
peat
tones
are
prevalent
to
me
theres
an
acidic
tinge
and
hoppy
undertones
a
little
lemon
but
the
malt
base
is
evident
and
sufficient
biscuity
bready
some
yeastiness
as
well
but
not
as
much
as
ive
become
accustomed
to
in
fine
belgian
brews
body
is
light
and
pleasing
drinkability

and
is
very
smooth
a
bit
too
sour
to
drink
very
much
but
a
very
interesting
bier
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
purchased
this
beer
because
of
the
bird
on
the
bottle
i
poured
this
bottle
into
my
usual
15
oz
mug
and
wished
that
i
had
a
32
oz
mug
there
is
so
much
head
on
this
beer
i
have
never
seen
head
like
this
before
its
big
pure
white
and
fluffy
i
had
the
head
coming
out
of
the
beer
by
an
inch
this
beer
is
a
yellow
that
turns
into
brown
and
is
very
cloudy
citrus
is
the
dominate
smell
with
a
hint
of
apples
this
beer
is
tart
without
being
bitter
it
is
slightly
sweet
weak
bodied
and
finisher
greatly
this
beer
leaves
great
lace
all
the
way
to
the
bottem
of
the
glass
at
7
abv
this
beer
is
still
surprisingly
drinkable
notes
oh
baby
this
is
a
nice
one
one
to
have
on
occasion
to
bring
the
whole
beer
thing
into
perspective
meaning
that
even
pale
brew
can
be
this
complex
and
flavourful
yet
drinkable
at
the
same
time
a
hazy
dark
golden
to
orange
amber
color
under
a
giant
white
smooth
head
head
is
huge
makes
my
belly
look
small
rich
creamy
vanilla
pudding
like
smells
are
lots
of
citrus
undertones
and
warm
spices
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
complex
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
experienced
inviting
spicy
richness
matched
with
crisp
citrus
lip
smacking
goodness
high
abv
will
sneek
right
up
on
you
and
warm
your
belly
at
the
same
time
bottom
of
the
glass
leaves
a
spicy
yeast
sediment
that
revives
the
last
few
sips
unbleievable
beer
i
picked
this
one
up
and
a
couple
other
from
the
same
brewery
on
the
recommendation
of
the
beer
store
owner
in
tampa
can
the
others
be
as
good
i
am
looking
forward
to
finding
out
great
for
motivating
you
when
ironing
well
thats
one
sock
done
this
belgian
ale
is
similar
to
chimay
cinq
cents
but
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
is
easier
to
drink
this
flavor
is
a
combination
of
toasted
and
caramel
malts
black
pepper
coriander
and
pleasant
barnyard
flavors
the
dry
hopping
is
marvelous
this
is
easy
to
drink
due
to
medium
strength
alcohol

i
had
more
than
one

w
a
hint

as

is
comprised
of
honey
notes

bit
of
nutty
sweetness

and

keeps
this

i
find
it
a
nice
beer
to
drink
out
on

deck

reading

hanging
with
friends
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
beer
to
be
fairly
average
all
around
light
orange
color
some
acidity
some
apricot
flavor
the
flavor
appears
upfront
and
then
promptly
disappears
i
actually
wish
i
had
poured
more
yeast
into
the
glass
so
this
beer
would
have
exhibited
more

a

offering
overall
another
great
beer
from
de
dolle
ive
yet
to
have
a
beer
from
these
guys
that
wasnt
very
good
as
far
as
im
concerned
theyre
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
in
the
world
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
on
tap
at
the
bull
and
bush
who
have
really
expanded
their
guest
offerings
in
the
last
half
year
or
so
this
is
my
first
from
these
guys
i
think
a
real
treat
listed
on
the
menu
at
8
9
abv
rather
than
the
10
abv
listed
here
but
i
am
attributing
that
to
batch
variance
rather
than
misinformation
a
great
beer
a
spring
strong
blonde
brewed
with
honey
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
like
a
classic
tripel
maybe
a
little
lighter
in
body
a
little
more
aggressively
hopped
and
a
little
lighter
on
the
leftover
sugar
but
the
belgian
yeast
pale
wheat
based
body
and
booze
component
are
all
on
par
with
the
style
some
floral
character
to
this
and
a
real
easy
drinking
lightness
for
its
enormity
i
know
this
isnt
one
of
the
rare
crazy
beers
from
these
guys
but
its
a
heck
of
an
introduction
to
a
very
storied
brewery
for
me
i
know
i
am
late
to
the
party
but
this
one
has
me
keen
for
more
so
dry
in
feel
and
for
a
fuller
bodied
strong
beer
its
a
nice
touch
cool
yeast
not
overdone
and
nice
crispy
carbonation
top
tier
brew
just
a
little
less
interesting
than
i
hoped
for
but
real
yummy
o
similar
to
but
less
fruity
and
dynamic
than
arabier
pretty
straightforward
offering
from
de
dolle
no
problem
with
that
would
likely
kill
it
accompanying
greasy
mussels
or
breaded
calamari
feel
like
its
lonely
on
its
own
a
little
hot
but
great
subtlety
of
malt
and
sweetbitter
balance
belgian
yeast
esters
are
lovely
o
pretty
funky
bspa
the
4
years
on
this
obvious
has
intensified
the
effects
interesting
heavy
sweetness
balancing
it
out
hard
to
gauge
this
one
very
interesting
overall
i
am
really
disappointed
i
thought
the
age
wouldnt
really
hurt
this
beer
but
it
obviously
has
a
couple
years
might
have
been
ok
but
five
or
six
is
just
too
much
a
shame
extremely
drinkable
for
its
weight
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
although
i
know
a
session
of
these
would
be
a
foolish
thing
to
do
the
characters
of
the
beer
almost
make
me
want
to
attempt
it
very
nice
stuff
indeed
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
lots
of
various
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
grain
and
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
fruity
presence
that
makes
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
excellent
a
really
good
and
distinctive
beer
from
a
really
good
brewery
bos
keun
has
a
gorgeous
cloudy
auburn
color
with
a
bleachedwhite
billowing
tower
of
bubbles
rising
with
even
the
most
miniscule
pouring
effort
this
head
is
similar
to
angels
food
cake
somehow
it
has
mass
but
its
very
light
and
airy
the
amount
of
bubbling
is
almost
too
much
but
i
did
not
score
this
very
negatively
due
to
some
of
the
other
classic
belgians
like
duvel
having
this
effect
of
course
with
this
type
of
head
we
get
excellent
lacing
as
a
result
the
smell
is
very
syrupy
sweet
like
toffee
and
taffy
along
with
tropical
fruits
and
the
signature
whiff
of
belgian
yeast
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
reminiscent
of
caramel
apples
at
the
fair
very
tart
and
slightly
astringent
delicious
pear
and
citrus
esters
as
well
the
mouth
feel
is
somewhat
viscous
and
the
finish
was
very
sharp
overall
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
other
exquisite
brews
from
de
dolle
this
is
a
top
belgian
brewer
that
any
fan
of
the
style
must
try
o
age
hasnt
treated
this
one
well
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
soon
but
ill
go
for
a
fresh
bottle
next
time
three
plus
years
was
just
too
long
its
so
effervescent
but
smooth
nicely
boozey
and
such
an
easy
drinker
really
great
brew
highly
recommend
this
especially
on
a
nice
warm
afternoon
cheers
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
de
dolle
i
have
had
it
many
times
even
at
the
brewery
after
a
fabulous
tour
by
the
brewers
mother
i
love
what
he
is
doing
there
and
this
is
a
beer
worth
having
and
a
different
take
on
the
style
if
i
had
to
choose
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
difficult
trying
to
pour
this
into
a
mug
resulted
in
the
entire
mug
being
filled
with
nothing
but
foam
and
a
mouthful
of
beer
on
the
bottom
going
down
and
finishing
had
a
very
bitter
taste
however
as
it
passed
through
my
mouth
the
taste
was
actually
quite
good
still
not
enough
to
save
this
beer
for
me
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
dense
cap
of
foam
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
brings
floral
hops
yeast
light
funk
subtle
citrus
smells
great
the
flavor
takes
it
up
a
notch
10
abv
where
grapefruit
rind
and
beautiful
belgian
pale
ale
character
dry
finish
with
plentiful
hop
bitterness
probably
my
favorite
of
this
genre
overall
a
fine
dry
strong
pale
ale
from
belgium
good
flavor
feel
and
overall
drinkability
the
bottle
used
for
this
review
was
bottled
in
february
2010
and
has
really
developed
well
review
from
42010
notes
poured
into
a
caracole
small
snifter
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
massive
white
head
and
high
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
malt
fresh
mixed
light
fruit
flavor
is
tasty
light
and
dark
fruits
with
belgian
spice
both
sweet
and
slightly
sour
tastes
very
good
slightly
marred
by
overcarbonation
which
gives
a
nice
hot
element
to
the
taste
but
is
a
bit
overdone
a
very
complex
unusual
and
tasty
ale
overall
it
comes
across
as
a
strangely
hoppy
bitter
crisp
wine
which
is
real
interesting
i
wonder
how
different
this
was
to
when
i
had
it
on
tap
gotta
check
those
ba
notes
nice
one
notes
served
from
bottle
at
cafe
bruges
in
carlisle
pa
been
on
lookout
for
this
brew
since
first
reading
about
it
on
the
beer
of
the
day
calendar
about
three
years
past
worth
the
wait
for
belgium
pale
ale
lovers
pairs
well
with
a
delicious
pizza
with
marinated
steak
and
gorgonzola
d
what
a
great
beer
like
many
ve
always
considered
duvel
to
be
the
archetype
but
this
yeasty
monster
rabbit
surpasses
what
i
consider
to
be
standard
by
taking
the
aroma
to
a
whole
nother
level
like
an
outer
space
level
clean
defined
flavors
overlayed
by
muddy
earthy
funky
yeast
make
for
a
beautiful
marriage
that
no
other
bspa
ive
had
so
far
has
achieved
impressive
an
incredible
array
of
fruity
notes
accompany
this
beer
strong
and
wellbalanced
with
a
range
of
flavours
that
is
both
subtle
and
complex
its
difficult
to
compare
this
to
anything
else
ive
tried
its
unique
not
a
brew
for
everyday
quaffing
but
well
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
foam
bomb
from
the
tap
this
one
had
to
settle
for
a
few
minutes
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
a
honey
brown
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
huge
rocky
tanwhite
head
that
retained
well
and
coated
the
glass
with
decorative
lacing
aroma
was
boozeheavy
phenols
yeast
more
yeast
and
a
bit
herbal
when
all
that
mellowed
out
a
bit
taste
was
extremely
potent
strong
with
grainy
alcohol
a
concentrated
dose
of
meadow
grass
and
flowers
hitting
soon
after
that
lighter
notes
of
peppery
yeast
and
citrus
pith
strong
but
flavorful
a
little
too
hot
to
be
exceptionally
drinkable
im
afraid
but
still
a
fine
brew
overall
maybe
let
this
one
sit
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
even
more
to
mellow
out
before
serving
after
my
disappointments
with
the
dolle
brouwers
this
is
a
nice
suprise
d
delicious
beer
this
one
is
just
excellent
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drink
this
was
a
tasty
little
beer
from
belgium
thanks
chris
i
love
de
dolle
from
the
few
i
have
had
and
this
was
another
great
offering
from
them
o
going
to
have
to
find
a
new
bottle
of
this
beer
because
i
definitely
feel
it
has
exceptional
qualities
perhaps
the
one
i
picked
up
was
stored
improperly
overall
i
am
not
sure
where
i
could
even
get
a
bottle
or
six
pack
and
the
full
pour
was
around
9
buck
can
you
say
overpriced
but
if
i
ever
was
around
belgium
this
would
be
my
go
to
pale
ale
no
second
guessing
33cl
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
brewed
feb
2010
you
could
tell
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
carbonation
when
i
popped
the
cap
poured
a
very
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
massive
big
bubbled
white
head
bottle
conditioned
complex
aroma
with
belgian
spice
dark
sugar
and
a
little
alcohol
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
fairly
dry
spicy
flavor
solid
malt
base
but
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
dry
finish
very
drinkable
at
10
didnt
get
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
just
a
little
in
the
aroma
good
stuff
o
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
really
like
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
pretty
complex
taste
of
fruit
spice
and
yeast
flavors
sweet
flavors
but
drinks
dry
well
crafted
brew
o
the
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
and
is
easy
to
drink
it
seems
to
exhibit
some
properties
of
a
strong
saison
nice
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
distinctively
fruity
yeast
presence
like
an
alcoholinfused
watermelon
with
freshly
steeped
grains
injected
into
it
interesting
and
unique
fairly
tasty
too
hoppy
easter
santa
claus
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
little
dash
of
red
just
a
tad
of
haze
too
a
huge
super
frothy
4
finger
slightly
off
white
head
fills
half
the
glass
and
is
very
slow
to
receded
smells
of
belgium
yeast
dominate
the
aroma
first
sip
is
surprisingly
quite
creamy
with
floral
yeast
notes
and
sweet
malts
blending
well
together
the
spice
is
low
and
lemony
but
not
overpowering
pretty
nice
brew
the
10
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
pours
golden
amber
in
color
slightly
cloudy
while
yeast
sediments
go
down
white
rocky
foam
incredible
high
thick
long
lasting
layer
small
bubbled
creamy
head
yeast
spices
to
the
nose
honey
sweet
mouthfeel
mildy
tartar
aftertaste
just
an
ok
beer
i
was
completely
unfamiliar
with
this
bee
when
i
ordered
it
unsure
of
what
id
get
what
i
got
however
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
one
which
i
would
definitely
have
again
overall
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
strong
golden
ale
the
abv
is
slightly
noticeable
but
a
good
drinking
ale
in
moderation
overall
this
is
an
epic
beer
for
the
style
from
one
of
the
top
breweries
on
earth
thanks
de
dolle
poured
all
head
white
and
very
slow
to
recede
i
almost
thought
it
was
permanent
smells
of
dried
fruit
and
malt
taste
is
fairly
rich
like
with
a
long
malty
finish
quite
nice
and
though
theres
10
alcohol
its
pretty
well
hidden
to
me
the
cheesey
bunny
on
the
label
had
me
doubting
this
beer
but
it
turned
out
to
be
really
good
not
impressed
for
the
price
and
other
ratings
ive
had
much
better
belgian
strong
pales
pours
a
light
brown
w
a
two
finger
head
nice
carbonation
and
good
lacing
nose
is
nice
sweet
fruit
sour
floral
slight
malt
as
well
taste
brings
out
the
nose
plus
some
honey
and
plum
this
is
a
solid
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
aftertaste
sticks
around
for
a
while
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
never
seen
it
before
check
it
out
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
it
got
old
fast
the
taste
and
aroma
just
tend
to
get
cloying
and
unappetizing
after
a
while
some
really
nice
qualities
here
however
the
intense
flavors
could
really
use
some
time
to
mature
and
mellow
othis
beer
is
a
great
example
of
what
makes
de
dolle
so
unique
stands
apart
from
almost
every
other
belgian
pale
ale
big
hot
candied
pale
ale
interesting
choice
to
use
goldings
makes
a
difference
burn
makes
me
think
maybe
shoulda
let
this
age
though
it
is
a
seasonal
this
might
be
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
highly
recommend
it
nice
light
body
here
but
as
with
most
of
de
dolle
beers
i
feel
like
this
one
is
a
little
bit
overcarbonated
id
love
to
see
them
tone
it
down
overall
though
a
great
offering
one
of
the
better
strong
pales
on
the
market
probably
my
favorite
overall
another
outstanding
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewer
od
not
too
shabby
but
not
great
i
drank
it
didnt
say
wow
and
was
ready
for
something
new
o
this
beer
strikes
a
lovely
balance
with
just
enough
bitterness
and
dryness
on
the
finish
while
leaving
just
a
wisp
behind
that
invites
another
sip
maybe
too
soon
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
while
still
rich
strong
beer
othis
is
definitely
a
good
beer
it
is
very
complex
though
i
feel
this
makes
the
beer
rather
harsh
this
is
definitely
not
for
beginners
with
this
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
the
abv
is
not
evident
anywhere
in
the
taste
i
wouldve
guessed
between
67
i
probably
wont
be
getting
this
again
i
feel
the
stille
nacht
is
leagues
beyond
this
still
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
high
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
the
yeast
spice
really
balanced
well
with
the
sweeter
crisp
fruit
flavors
overall
very
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
abv
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
i
think
it
has
some
flaws
overall
this
beer
is
a
winner
in
my
book
a
complex
and
comforting
easter
beer
that
successfully
embodies
the
the
season
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
the
massive
carbonation
typical
of
de
dolle
the
meringuelike
head
eventually
settles
leaving
bits
of
cotton
candylike
lace
smells
of
marizpan
sugaredwhite
peach
and
mango
taste
is
complex
and
sweet
but
balanced
by
more
bracing
bitterness
than
i
recall
a
sort
of
creme
brulee
like
sweetness
shows
up
as
the
beer
warms
up
near
room
temperature
very
tasty
quit
a
good
beer
with
potent
powers
in
it
the
beer
actually
looks
somewhat
beautiful
with
a
great
contrast
between
the
cloudy
orange
brew
and
its
stark
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
fruit
base
lighter
fruits
citrus
and
apple
maybe
but
is
still
complex
beyond
that
slightly
bready
and
quite
yeasty
on
sipping
oh
my
i
really
enjoyed
the
ees
mentioned
above
but
the
extremity
of
its
taste
cost
it
some
drinkability
bk
on
the
other
hand
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
different
from
its
outlandish
cousin
its
consistent
and
creamy
and
the
sweet
light
fruits
come
together
wonderfully
with
the
choice
of
malt
a
kind
of
medium
gravity
pearmango
experience
with
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
throughout
after
my
next
long
day
ill
be
sure
to
toil
through
the
pour
for
this
awesome
reward
drinkability
and
overall
impression
while
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
overall
i
thought
there
was
just
a
touch
too
much
sweetness
in
the
mix
for
the
complexity
to
balance
out
i
could
see
having
it
again
as
a
special
occasion
beer
but
id
not
want
it
on
a
regular
basis
my
overall
impression
is
that
it
is
a
well
made
holiday
beer
and
best
consumed
as
a
holiday
treat
o
this
brewery
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
anywhere
in
the
world
drinkability
tasty
though
expensive
and
i
can
actually
feel
the
carbonation
fill
my
stomach
would
be
interested
in
having
it
on
tap
but
otherwise
it
was
just
ok
d
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
de
dolle
be
careful
with
this
one
10
abv
o
a
very
nice
drinker
and
you
wouldnt
think
its
10
alcohol
at
all
it
comes
of
very
refreshing
and
seems
like
a
pale
that
was
hopped
a
little
more
and
had
some
candi
added
but
doesnt
spill
the
beans
as
to
its
potency
violent
carbonation
led
to
a
glass
full
of
foam
eventually
a
cloudy
golden
liquid
fills
the
glass
with
a
large
head
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
vinous
with
pale
malt
mild
spice
and
some
herbalness
the
flavor
is
not
as
dry
as
many
big
pale
belgians
hints
of
tropical
fruit
pears
and
just
a
faintest
hint
of
tart
apple
other
than
being
overcarbonated
the
body
is
spot
on
the
bottle
was
just
too
overcarbonated
and
it
was
annoying
to
pour
this
beer
otherwise
a
great
bspa
i
cant
believe
how
well
this
drinks
no
negative
flavors
can
be
attributed
to
alcohol
presence
and
its
actually
somewhat
refreshing
very
hard
to
believe
its
a
10
beer
i
actually
didnt
expect
too
much
out
of
this
one
for
whatever
reason
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
more
good
work
de
dolle
cheers
d
easy
to
drink
and
something
that
i
would
gladly
try
again
next
time
ill
try
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
so
i
can
compare
i
thought
that
this
one
might
have
been
past
its
prime
because
of
the
floaters
and
the
sour
aroma
but
it
is
not
i
really
like
de
dolle
my
first
de
dolle
beer
finally
used
a
chimay
chalice
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
lot
of
head
on
the
pour
tastes
of
sweet
candied
sugars
with
a
green
applepear
fruit
finish
i
thought
this
finished
very
smooth
and
its
incredibly
drinkable
for
10
alc
very
impressed
with
this
beer
pours
a
light
peach
color
with
a
ridiculously
longlasting
white
head
pretty
bubbly
with
some
nice
streaky
lacing
the
nose
is
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruit
maybe
some
pear
the
taste
is
quite
yeasty
with
some
mild
spice
and
a
bit
of
light
fruit
there
is
green
pear
and
some
stone
fruits
the
nose
is
slightly
buttery
as
it
warms
not
diacetylits
more
of
a
chardonnaytype
butter
character
the
taste
is
pretty
good
but
drops
off
from
the
nose
dry
spice
takes
over
in
the
finish
drinks
pretty
well
though
isnt
quite
the
top
50
belgian
beer
i
had
hoped
for
pours
very
hazy
with
a
copper
color
and
orange
hues
an
extremely
large
head
due
to
the
overcarbonation
good
lacing
nose
reminds
me
of
fresh
green
apples
and
cider
slightly
yeasty
very
pleasant
nose
the
taste
is
fantastic
fresh
apples
pale
malt
light
white
pepper
from
the
yeast
and
other
sharp
spices
all
from
the
yeast
very
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
was
a
slight
gusher
and
it
was
confirmed
to
be
overcarbonated
once
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
has
some
very
positive
notes
but
it
just
misses
pulling
it
all
together
to
be
one
of
the
best
review
from
notes
tasted
from
a
gusher
of
a
bottle
at
lush
west
town
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
leaves
heavy
lace
nose
is
anise
something
herbal
yeast
and
something
slightly
sour
flavor
is
sweet
with
caramel
malt
chocolate
cinnamon
clove
coriander
and
citrus
the
body
is
full
with
light
carbonation
and
a
long
warming
finish
d
very
good
for
a
10
beer
but
the
sweetness
would
limit
it
for
me
im
not
sure
if
i
would
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
that
one
is
going
down
rather
well
if
i
drank
it
as
warm
as
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
2
probably
wouldnt
be
hard
to
have
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
good
carbonation
for
a
twofinger
head
and
lace
patches
a
citrusy
smell
as
well
as
some
pale
and
sweet
malt
smells
light
and
prickly
thanks
to
some
spices
and
sharp
carbonation
has
some
fruit
tastes
like
a
minor
tropical
fruit
taste
as
well
as
citrusorange
w
that
typical
belgian
yeast
strain
also
some
sweetness
like
caramel
and
honey
w
the
sweet
and
fruithoppy
flavors
well
balanced
for
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
scarier
still
is
not
only
the
complexity
and
balance
but
the
abv
is
rather
wellhidden
so
this
could
be
a
dangerous
sipper
beer
is
light
in
body
and
really
bright
on
the
palate
but
finishes
completely
clean
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
unibroue
beers
some
alcohol
up
front
with
minimal
sweetness
finishes
not
dry
but
wet
its
highly
drinkable
and
i
would
have
this
again
for
sure
a
really
nice
bspa
notes
im
not
sure
its
a
bspa
but
its
very
tasty
almost
like
a
belgian
barleywine
or
belgian
wheat
wine
slick
and
sweet
it
hides
the
abv
very
well
makes
a
nice
treat
on
a
chilly
october
night
awesome
d
delicious
beer
my
third
de
dolle
this
one
is
just
excellent
as
the
others
in
short
a
characterful
beer
that
abounds
with
fruity
flavors
and
spicy
nature
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
hurt
a
little
by
slightly
too
prominent
alcohol
but
overall
its
fantastic
i
dont
want
it
to
end
d
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
not
quite
light
or
dark
but
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
bad
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
were
incorporated
together
exceptionally
well
for
perfect
balance
some
age
might
further
enhance
this
but
it
was
very
nice
fresh
the
epidome
of
this
style
seems
to
be
duvel
with
leffe
blonde
comming
in
later
bos
keun
reminds
me
much
more
of
the
leffe
but
with
bolder
belgiany
notes
higher
dryness
and
deeper
over
all
complexity
if
you
like
leffe
youll
wecome
this
beer
very
very
very
well
d
an
extremely
well
made
drinkable
beer
d
well
i
like
this
beer
but
at
10
and
the
back
in
sweetness
make
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
1
which
sadly
is
unlike
a
good
triple
and
so
i
hate
to
down
rate
it
some
the
cute
demented
bunny
on
the
label
knows
whats
in
store
when
you
pour
this
beauty
into
a
snifter
a
cloudy
dull
golden
color
works
under
a
dense
white
head
that
holds
strong
throughout
the
enjoyment
of
this
i
detected
an
aroma
of
sweet
citrus
and
slight
hint
of
what
i
could
only
describe
as
wool
this
introduced
itself
to
me
with
a
highly
carbonated
fruity
and
tart
upfront
and
center
mouthfeel
that
continues
into
a
fizzy
explosion
of
flavor
and
fizzy
berry
aftertaste
delicious
refreshing
and
a
great
compliment
to
moules
frietjes
cant
wait
to
drink
this
again
bos
keun
is
a
bit
of
a
revelation
to
me
this
is
my
first
offering
from
de
dolle
and
it
is
tremendous
the
6
price
tag
is
substantial
it
would
probably
be
closer
to
10
had
i
bought
it
in
my
homestate
of
pa
but
worth
it
as
an
infrequent
treat
as
you
can
tell
from
my
avatar
i
hold
duvel
in
very
high
regard
and
this
beer
is
easily
as
good
this
is
certainly
worthy
of
its
lofty
ba
rating
im
going
to
have
to
stop
putting
off
cracking
open
that
de
dolle
oerbier
i
have
waiting
in
my
cellar
drinkability
i
have
had
some
de
dolle
beers
that
didnt
hit
the
mark
but
this
one
is
one
i
would
come
back
to
despite
my
initial
fears
drink
it
fresh
or
aged
well
im
sure
it
will
hold
up
fine
overall
a
very
spicy
and
alcoholic
beer
but
enjoyable
nontheless
a
tasty
spicy
treat
but
a
bit
too
raw
on
the
palate
to
be
overly
drinkable
one
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
i
really
liked
this
after
not
particularly
digging
the
dulle
teve
and
the
stout
nice
one
for
sure
di
think
this
was
in
the
early
stage
of
an
infection
it
didnt
really
taste
infected
but
it
fizzed
up
like
crazy
interesting
stuff
and
ill
definitely
have
to
try
another
this
is
a
quirky
brew
it
is
pretty
blunt
in
the
flavor
department
and
overall
another
solid
beer
from
de
dolle
this
brewery
is
great
although
i
still
believe
the
oerbier
to
be
the
crown
jewel
bos
keun
pours
out
a
murky
gold
color
with
a
massive
amount
of
white
heading
tropical
fruit
smells
lift
from
the
beer
with
some
dry
champagne
character
the
fruit
takes
center
stage
taste
wise
it
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
does
end
on
a
somewhat
bitter
hoppy
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
boozy
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
am
not
having
any
problems
finishing
this
bottle
but
i
prefer
this
style
when
it
is
more
dry
and
balanced
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
which
is
a
plus
extremely
drinkable
for
being
10
alcohol
content
the
flavors
carbonation
and
lacing
of
the
head
made
for
a
enjoyable
experience
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
date
ive
liked
everything
ive
tried
from
de
dolle
d
i
think
this
is
a
great
easter
beer
fom
the
du
dolle
brewery
glad
i
had
a
chance
in
finding
one
of
these
will
try
to
find
another
bottle
d
drinks
well
but
too
sweet
and
strange
for
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
alcohol
presence
also
cuts
the
drinkability
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
easily
palatable
of
de
dolles
offerings
very
drinkable
for
reviewing
purposes
ive
graded
greatly
down
for
mouthfeel
because
of
carbonation
issue
however
nose
flavors
and
finish
were
super
solid
im
hoping
carbonation
is
an
issue
that
will
be
more
insignificant
in
other
bottles
notes
like
i
said
this
bottle
was
a
gusher
but
luckily
i
was
able
to
grab
a
glass
and
only
lose
a
little
bit
of
beer
lots
of
fruit
particularly
citrus
that
has
some
slight
tartness
in
the
middle
but
is
predominantly
sweet
although
not
cloying
by
any
means
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
overall
a
pretty
good
strong
belgian
ale
a
little
on
the
sour
side
with
sweetness
coming
through
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
and
once
again
hard
to
believe
that
this
packs
10
d
my
favourite
new
beer
of
the
young
year
de
dolle
continues
to
impress
and
push
the
boundaries
i
have
a
couple
de
dolles
left
and
plan
to
buy
the
remaining
available
ones
when
i
go
back
to
the
store
a
must
try
d
very
high
given
the
abv
at
10
this
beer
reminds
me
of
duvel
in
many
ways
only
it
is
far
more
intense
more
fruit
and
more
spice
amazing
beer
review
from
notes
taken
on
10609
d
for
a
10
abv
this
one
drinks
like
a
champ
de
dolle
never
disappoints
and
nothing
beats
sitting
around
listening
to
om
or
whatever
your
doom
metal
of
choice
is
with
a
boskeun
and
some
triple
cream
cheese
recommended
33
cl
bottle
poured
into
unibroue
tulip
a
bizzare
brown
rabbit
adorns
the
bottle
and
he
appears
to
be
high
or
drunk
boskeun
in
hand
i
presume
as
expected
the
bottle
slowly
gushed
forth
before
the
pour
cant
locate
bottle
date
i
think
it
wore
off
the
cap
head
retains
for
quite
a
while
it
looks
soft
id
like
to
take
a
nap
on
its
pillowey
bubbles
aroma
is
bursting
out
of
the
tulip
as
the
head
reduces
smells
like
peaches
a
little
funk
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
stands
out
on
this
one
as
the
flavors
coat
the
tongue
front
to
back
certainly
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
a
10
abv
a
testament
to
how
well
the
flavors
are
melded
together
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
map
and
they
seem
to
be
changing
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
warms
fruit
sweetness
mixes
with
funk
to
create
a
delicious
treat
paired
well
with
a
deep
fried
blue
cheese
ball
this
is
delicious
warming
beer
highmarks
all
around
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
the
flavors
are
all
huge
and
present
in
perfect
amounts
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
pretty
high
especially
considering
this
is
a
10er
this
could
knock
you
out
d
moderate
went
down
easy
i
enjoyed
many
things
about
this
beer
i
was
confounded
by
the
flavor
profile
though
i
dont
know
if
im
too
much
of
a
greenhorn
to
grasp
all
the
things
this
beer
has
going
for
it
i
think
ill
have
some
more
bspas
and
come
back
to
this
one
rereviewing
if
necessary
unique
and
exceptional
ale
which
never
fails
to
impress
me
the
best
beer
for
spring
ive
imbibed
whatever
the
time
of
year
overall
an
amazing
beer
from
de
dolle
as
ive
come
to
expect
the
complexity
and
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
is
truly
exceptional
amazing
nose
of
peach
with
a
high
frothy
long
lasting
head
with
an
almost
soapy
mouthfeel
flavor
profile
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
says
it
should
be
and
by
the
second
sip
notes
of
applewood
become
prominent
extremely
interesting
but
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
best
used
as
an
aperitif
d
im
starting
to
like
this
style
more
and
more
a
strong
belgian
with
a
mouthfeel
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
an
abv
that
says
whoa
full
bodied
great
great
offering
from
de
dolle
the
taste
is
unique
and
complex
not
what
you
would
expect
from
a
pale
its
got
great
flavor
from
start
to
finish
and
has
a
surprising
bitter
finish
light
notes
of
citrus
at
the
first
sip
pours
a
yellow
gold
with
a
bit
over
a
finger
of
pillowy
white

good
complex
with
lots
of

some

good
10
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
beer
is
complex
and
enjoyable
bos
keun
is
definitely
a
worldclass
beer
i
could
not
imagine
my
easter
morning
starting
off
any
better
then
with
this
brew
in
hand
a
nice
drinking
ale
the
spiciness
remains
with
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
signature
de
dolle
an
almost
drying
spritzy
soft
carbonation
that
expands
in
your
mouth
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
pours
a
fully
fogged
in
brown
hued
orange
with
a
thick
frothy
crème
head
nose
is
perfumey
and
floral
tones
dough
and
spices
as
well
flavor
is
extremely
smooth
good
levels
of
hops
sugars
and
spices
very
well
out
together
feel
is
a
full
and
slightly
nipping
carbonation
liquid
is
typical
this
is
very
nice
and
too
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
pace
myself
in
order
to
savor
it
and
let
it
warm
to
see
what
happens
highly
suggested
for
those
who
love
belgian
yeast
and
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
this
may
be
for
you
its
not
for
me
d
with
each
sip
i
detected
something
new
and
i
felt
myself
craving
more
sips
once
the
bottle
was
drained
i
am
still
amazed
that
this
did
not
become
a
gusher
on
me

overall
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
and
a
fine
pairing
for
dinner
another
good
beer
from
the
brewery
that
doesnt
seem
to
know
how
to
make
bad
beer
recommended
drinkability
i
aged
this
beer
for
about
three
years
in
the
hopes
to
tame
it
down
but
it
still
has
a
bit
too
much
booziness
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
however
with
an
interesting
blend
of
the
sweet
and
the
tart
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
kick
and
a
nice
mixture
of
spice
nice
complexities
and
despite
the
glaring
alcohol
this
has
a
smoothness
and
flavor
that
make
this
sipper
dangerously
drinkable
drinkability
for
around
5
a
bottle
like
most
of
de
dolle
or
at
least
thats
what
i
pay
for
them
you
know
youre
getting
your
moneys
worth
this
ones
big
at
actually
10
and
not
the
7
that
it
says
can
there
please
be
a
ba
that
does
abv
fixing
on
the
side
more
and
more
im
finding
incorrect
numbers
currently
above
and
the
alcohol
isnt
as
prominent
as
one
may
figure
all
of
the
belgian
points
of
interest
are
there
in
spades
and
id
love
to
see
how
these
are
years
and
years
down
the
road
as
theyre
probably
always
changing
with
the
yeast
being
such
a
huge
part
usually
floating
around
just
with
a
light
bump
glad
i
bought
this
and
will
jump
at
another
chance
to
have
another
of
their
brews
is
it
me
or
does
sipping
on
a
good
belgian
not
make
the
air
you
breathe
around
you
start
to
become
more
aromatic
craziness
galore
boom
after
the
signature
de
dolle
hello
tons
of
foam
and

this
beer
turns
into
a
hazy

of

going

date
taste
is
fruity
lemon
pepper
tea
poured
over
caramel
apples
with
a
very
peppery
and
long
lasting
finish
that
carries
a
bit
of
boozy
warmth
a
little
overboard
on
the
carbonation
and
pretty
strong
so
i
would
tone
down
to
the
ara
bier
for
multiple
rounds
another
great
offering
from
de
dolle
tmd
mild
carbonation
with
a
spicy
peppery
taste
and
a
slightly
bready
taste
and
feel
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
at
first
but
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
it
starts
to
balance
out
nicely
alcohol
seems
more
apparent
than
id
expect
for
its
abv
but
not
unpleasantly
so
nice
beer
the
cleanliness
of
the
finish
is
utterly
amazing
cleanfresh
and
crisp
someday
i
wold
like
to
drink
this
with
easter
dinner
the
cleanliness
of
this
bier
would
complement
some
honey
glazed
ham
with
spring
vegetables
i
will
purchase
again
and
again
very
good
very
complex
brew
obviously
im
a
fan
overall
incredible
beer
this
brewery
does
not
disappoint
good
dirty
fun
beer
d
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
another
excellent
offering
from
de
dolle
pours
a
brownish
orange
color

an
initially
fierce

nice
lacing

around

well
deep
boozy

tropical
fruit
aroma
is
pleasing
taste
is
slightly
medicinal
with
a
peppery
finish
fruit
nuances
interplay
with
a
musty
yeast
flavor
that
i
could
be
more
excited
about
finishes
with
a
prickly
carbonation
tapering
to
aforementioned
musty
yeastiness
all
in
all
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
although
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
d
probably
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
seasonal
brews
of
all
time
definitely
recommended
to
anyone
who
wants
a
crisp
refreshing
springsummer
ale
that
will
satisfy
their
palate
and
kick
their
ass
all
at
the
same
time
mmmm
poured
from
12oz
bottle
first
off
the
label
is
excellent
there
is
no
rating
catagory
for
this
but
if
there
was
i
would
give
it
a
5
pours
a
dark
amber
with
small
chunks
of
sediment
suspended
very
colloidesque
smell
is
fantastic
pure
belgian
fruit
esters
specifically
banana
and
smell
hints
at
the
above
average
abv
very
smooth
and
complex
taste
bananas
are
very
prominent
extremely
dry
finish
the
overall
boozeyness
takes
away
from
drinkablity
the
abv
may
be
high
but
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
at
all
and
while
that
may
lead
to
dangers
down
the
road
if
one
puts
back
a
few
of
these
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
small

belgian

lovers
rejoice
and
go
get
some
d
drinks
bigger
then
advertised
abv
and
may
hinder
drinkability
slightly
this
one
was
opened
at
celler
temp
so
it
was
foaming
and
disturbing
the
yeast
sediment
thus
causing
it
to
mix
within
the
beer
every
de
dolle
i
open
does
this
so
i
think
next
one
i
will
chill
in
fridge
prior
to
opening
nice
puffy
head
that
laces
the
glass
after
it
is
gone
tart
aroma
with
a
champagne
quality
some
candy
and

taste
with
honey
sweetness
awesome
complex
yeast
flavor
like
i
get
from
all
of
their
beers
a
full
mouthfeel
with
a
very
dry
finish
exactly
how
i
want
a
belgian
ale
to
taste
yum
i
cant
help
but
be
surprised
by
the
high
reviews
im
sure
its
all
bias
towards
the
brewery
which
is
mostly
excellent
stille
nacht
oerbeir
reserve
are
true
masterpieces
plus
id
guess
the
fact
that
i
compared
this
to
3
other
bspatype
beers
at
the
same
time
made
a
big
difference
in
my
perspective
fact
is
i
wont
be
bothering
with
this
one
again
any
time
soon
sorry
d
like
everything
else
ive
had
from
de
dolle
i
am
happy
with
the
overall
beer
i
like
that
it
isnt
quite
normal
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
copped
a
single

2
oz
bottle
from
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
de
dolles
mad
bitch
was
great
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
which
failed
to
dissapoint
very
attractive
foamy
cloudy
hazy
appearance
with
an
orange
hue
complemented
the
syle
with
an
impressive
frothy
head
that
soon
receded
pure
fresh
smell
bursting
through
with
florals
esters
and
candy
taste
was
equally
sweet
with
grapefruit
caramel
vanilla
and
sugar
notes
seems
as
if
de
dolle
has
a
penchant
for
brewing
some
seriously
thick
rich
and
sweet
beers
because
this
one
exactly
fit
the
bill
extracreamy
ultrathick
mouthfeel
led
to
a
pretty
good
level
of
drinkability
especially
due
to
the
notoverthetop
abv
of
7
special
paasbier
on
the
logo
sticker
with
a
brown
rabbit
kicking
back
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
enjoying
a
brew
overall
this
was
a
very
good
sample
authentic
and
truetothe
style
definitely
recommended
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
very
healthy
head
with
tight
white
bubbles
complex
aromas
of
pear
cream
cardomom
lemon
white
pepper
and
a
tiny
bit
of
funk
as
well
as
something
a
bit
savory
the
taste
is
aalso
complexwith
clove
cream
pepper
minerally
a
little
bitter
and
quite
spicy
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
evident
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
crisp
and
spicy
absolutely
delicious
as
is
most
of
what
this
brewery
makes
d
a
strong
flavored
beer
intense
and
fresh
well
made
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
and
hope
to
try
it
again
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
but
it
is
very
mysterious
it
is
hard
to
pull
all
the
flavors
apart
and
they
really
just
blend
one
flavor
into
the
next
good
spring
beer
with
nice
flavor
and
spice
with
a
little
heat
in
the
finish
d
wonderful
beer
light
but
well
rounded
a
real
refreshing
strong
ale
drinkability
ill
gladly
take
another
one
of
these
almost
like
a
dessert
beer
pleasure
to
drink
this
one
a
beer
from
the
dolle
brouwers
mad
brewers
and
so
it
is
probably
fermented
at
higher
temperatures
this
beer
is
low
in
drinkability
and
too
extreme
for
me
md
softly
carbonated
almost
silky
smooth
on
the
texture
the
body
is
full
but
never
has
it
shown
any
bit
of
high
alc
content
on
the
palate
this
is
a
rich
and
deeplyflavoured
strong
pale
ale
with
a
soft
landing
almost
designed
to
deceive
the
drinker
a
lovely
and
highquality
beer
this
is
but
not
something
i
would
have
for
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile201634bagreencard
d
quite
enjoyable
the
fruity
smells
and
flavors
are
pronounced
and
at
the
same
time
subdued
excellent
balance
thanks
for
sending
this
one
my
way
nlmartin
very
drinkable
but
not
one
to
stay
on
all
night
an
excellent
offering
from
de
dolle
d
i
am
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
pales
or
trippels
i
pick
up
notes
from
both
in
this
one
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
complex
in
all
aspects
but
very
drinkable
i
believe
this
one
has
a
little
bit
of
age
to
it
notes
im
not
very
wellversed
with
this
style
but
reading
up
on
the
style
notes
i
think
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
meeting
it
complex
flavor
melding
made
it
an
interesting
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
more
in
this
style
as
a
result
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
very
good
and
very
drinkable
d
i
dont
think
i
could
get
tired
of
this
definitely
my
stranded
on
a
desert
island
beer
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
a
cloudy
and
yeasty
golden
tan
mammoth
rocky
brown
head
that
stays
around
forever
and
ever
big
fruity
aromas
tart
lime
lemon
green
apples
and
pink
grapefruit
on
a
spicy
black
pepper
yeast
and
alcohol
background
flavor
is
sparse
and
dry
compared
with
the
aroma
tangy
rounded
lime
starts
out
sweet
and
becomes
sour
with
green
apples
blends
with
yeasty
and
funky
earthiness
in
the
center
before
finishing
with
strong
peppery
alcohol
dryness
medium
body
with
outrageous
amounts
of
carbonation
this
sample
has
clearly
been
around
a
while
but
its
very
good
when
well
cared
for
mouthfeeldrinkability
while
this
beers
texture
in
the
mouth
is
virtually
exquisite
the
swallow
is
disproportionately
harsh
and
detrimental
to
its
drinkability
after
swirling
in
the
yeast
sediment
towards
the
end
of
this
tasting
the
smoothness
improves
as
does
the
overall
flavor
integration
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
theres
no
way
id
buy
this
again
d
this
is
a
good
beer
takes
a
lot
of
quality
belgian
characteristics
and
wraps
them
into
one
successfully
im
a
fan
some
mild
fruit
notes
datefig
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
hot
alcohol
in
the
finish

simplistic

ale
not
unpleasant
but
not
exceptional
33cl
bottle
a
hazy
cross
between
a
dark
golden
and
lighter
amber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
head
on
it
which
leaves
some
lacing

nose
also
notes
of
fruits
possible
sour
apples
the
taste
is
semi
sweet
some
notes
of
sour
apples
caramel
malts
slightly
lighter
body
than
expected
nice
from
the
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
murky
yellowish
brown
that
tends
toward
orange
the
head
is
large
and
stable
and
is
fed
with
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
nice
aroma
of
earthy
musty
yeast
with
a
lot
deep
malt
sweetness
its
quite
estery
and
theres
a
subtle
honey
quality
that
runs
through
the
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
influenced
by
the
high
carbonation
in
this
beer
its
quite
sweet
with
a
mild
acidic
twang
and
a
lot
of
malt
and
honey
flavor
the
finish
gets
a
bit
spicy
and
theres
a
notable
alcohol
warming
that
settles
in
about
half
way
through
the
glass
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
well
constructed
brew
flavor
is
lighter
than
expected
slightly
empty
but
with
a
gentle
sweetness
burnt
sugar
slight
fruitiness
and
mild
honey
flavors
fairly
light
carbonation
with
a
heavy
feel
could
be
a
little
bolder
in
the
flavor
but
its
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
no
freshness
date
lasting
thick
head
and
nice
amberbrown
beercollor
with
big
floks
in
it
but
in
the
light
it
gives
a
unreal
whirling
sight
nose
is
bananafruity
and
spicy
with
slight
coreander
and
citrus
peals
creamy
sweet
and
full
with
good
malts
in
nose
as
in
taste
that
apeals
alcoholic
also
and
with
that
good
and
strong
bitterness
malty
but
fitting
sweetness
with
it
makes
it
well
balanced
but
heavy
imo
great
brew
to
enjoy
and
sip
but
also
well
drinkable
d
a
little
low
due
to
the
oversweetness
mouthfeel
is
sweet
bubbly
dry
lip
numbing
from
the
sugar
overall
an
excellent
beer
definitely
recommended
from
the
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
left

of

a
touch

a
slight

bite
nice
bitterness
at
the
finish
good
beer
a
good
bspa
that
leans
towards
a
triple
i
like
it
and
my
only
regret
is
not
stopping
to
buy
some
cheeses
after
work
tonight
mouthfeel
pretty
wheaty
all
over
the
tongue
or
should
i
say
weizen
like
even
though
its
hard
to
see
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
you
can
feel
it
on
your
tongue
overall
an
excellent
fascinating
beer
its
got
complexity
in
the
nose
and
in
the
palate
and
the
interest
piqued
by
those
elements
combined
with
the
tasty
flavors
makes
me
want
more
of
this
yum
not
bad
maybe
not
worth
the
price
on
a
regular
basis
the
only
beers
ill
buy
regularly
in
that
price
range
are
from
st
bernardus
overall
id
say
the
boskeun
was
my
least
favorite
de
dolle
beer
not
too
interested
in
another
but
clearly
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
sweet
spun
sugar
aroma
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
cloudy
goldyellow
color
with
a
massive
belgian
head
spicy
and
overtly
alcoholic
some
sweetness
but
that
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
malt
and
hop
bitterness
that
stand
atop
the
alcohol
and
spice
comes
across
much
too
harsh
flavorwise
for
my
taste
pours
an
hazy
orange
tinged
straw
color
with
enourmous
fluffy
white
head
that
refuses
to
go
away
nice
spicy
smell
with
sharp
peppery
smell
a
little
dried
fruit
under
there
somewhere
taste
is
a
bit
sharp
with
again
white
pepper
spices
and
hay
some
distant
candied
fruit
in
there
as
well
a
little
alcohol
burn
in
there
too
feels
smooth
and
slick
in
the
mouth
a
sippable
treat
but
only
one
at
a
time
please
pours
a
half
golden
half
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
lasts
long
into
the
drink
and
a
dark
residue
that
collects
as
it
settles
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
hints
of
wine
fresh
fruits
smokey
alcohol
hints
very
solid
olafactor
taste
is
a
bit
overbearing
at
first
somewhat
bitter
with
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
kills
it
for
me
has
flashes
of
classic
belgian
ales
but
this
one
just
isnt
top
notch
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
acidic
i
couldnt
drink
this
is
excess
but
only
as
an
occasional
fair
drinkability
this
is
one
tasty
well
balanced
treat
the
alcohol
flavor
is
nowhere
in
the
beers
taste
a
dam
fine
beer
any
day
of
the
week
give
it
a
try
i
poured
it
into
a
wine
glass
and
the
look
was
a
deeper
pale
copper
than
expected
the
smell
was
alcoholly
and
pineappley
and
some
yeast
there
was
a
smooth
tart
quality
here
and
a
spicy
finish
of
star
anise
and
herbs
as
the
brew
warmed
the
mouthfeel
changed
and
the
alcohol
became
more
pronounced
adding
to
the
snap
and
tang
of
the
finish
another
great
beer
from
de
dolle
cheers
beertracker
the
alcohol
catches
up
as
you
reach
the
end
of
the
bottle
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
but
its
lovely
to
sip
on
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
quaff
this
like
witbier
very
refreshing
is
there
anything
the
dedolle
brothers
cant
do
a
good
but
very
different
beer
the
alcohol
was
too
much
at
the
end
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
beige
color
ale
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
yeast
us
extremely
present
as
well
as
strong
malt
and
a
huge
spice
mix
funky
yeast
with
strong
spice
mix
and
some
sugary
feeling
at
the
end
body
if
full
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
another
great
de
dolle
beer
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
great
one
to
try
but
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
probably
pass
it
up
for
something
better
but
it
is
definetly
worth
trying
and
its
not
like
i
would
complain
if
i
came
across
this
again
try
it
gloriously
large
and
substantial
head
rises
on
the
careful
pour
into
my
maudite
goblet
stubborn
divalike
retention
the
head
falls
eventually
leaving
some
nice
foamy
patches
of
lace
on
the
glass
body
is
grainy
gold
smell
stark
musty
sourness
upfront
a
good
thing
followed
by
an
aged
bleu
cheese
yeast
funk
that
has
a
nice
texture
to
it
not
at
all
unpleasant
the
finish
is
a
cottoncandy
sweetness
riding
out
over
the
top
taste
complex
sweetness
upfront
cherries
brown
sugar
with
an
underbelly
of
toasted
pecans
sourdough
bread
the
middle
is
a
strong
punch
of
funky
yeast
really
nice
peppery
and
moldy
this
is
a
good
thing
trust
me
the
finish
much
like
the
nose
goes
back
to
a
sharp
sweetness
that
rides
out
over
the
top
of
the
depth
of
complex
flavors
spicy
dry
aftertaste
lovely
mouthfeel
creamy
very
carbonated
which
is
a
good
thing
as
it
helps
zip
up
the
strong
flavor
in
a
nice
tight
mouthpackage
wonderful
brew
glad
i
found
a
bottle
purchased
at
the
north
coast
coop
in
arcata
california
looks
to
be
about
a
12
ounce
bottle
love
the
bucktoothed
rabbit
on
the
label
typically
quirky
belgian
packaging
always
gives
me
a
pang
of
strange
delight
one
of
the
most
pleasantly
fragrant
beers
i
have
ever
smelled
when
i
poured
it
i
thought
someone
had
opened
a
can
of
potpourri
or
something
smells
like
sweet
hops
and
wheat
with
a
certain
citrus
that
i
am
unable
to
put
my
finger
on
other
beers
from
this
brewery
have
huge
heads
but
there
is
a
medium
sized
one
on
this
the
taste
is
good
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
but
it
has
the
same
sweet
hops
and
wheat
flavor
as
you
take
more
and
more
sips
you
get
used
to
the
taste
and
it
gets
very
agreeable
had
this
on
tap
over
the
weekend
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
what
a
great
aroma
lots
of
fruits
citrus
some
spices
slight
alcohol
very
nice
aroma
the
flavor
is
odd
and
interesting
but
very
good
as
well
has
a
definate
orangecorriander
thing
going
on
but
also
has
a
peppery
spice
to
go
along
with
some
belgian
yeast
character
slight
bit
of
alcohol
sticks
around
to
remind
you
to
drink
slow
even
though
its
extra
tasty
body
is

and

drinkability
is
very
nice
drinkability
and
overall
beer
2
of
my
session
today
and
this
is
a
good
one
loads
of
sweetness
and
complexity
make
this
one
incredibly
interesting
yet
somehow
drinkable
its
odd
nuances
keep
you
sipping
for
quite
a
while
a
wonderful
beer
for
sure
beautiful
beer
drinkable
by
itself
or
paired
with
spicy
food
or
seafood
such
heavy
fizzy
leads
to
a
grand
body
and
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
too
much
of
wonderful
wonderful
beer
edit
i
agree
with
previous
reviews
and
might
try
cellaring
a
bottle
for
another
goround
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
healthy
1
eggshell
head
over
the
golden
amber
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
and
lacing
is
superb
aroma
is
sweet
cotton
candy
with
a
touch
of
spicy
malts
taste
is
upfront
smooth
yet
spicy
malts
then
the
sweetness
takes
over
and
dominates
and
fades
with
an
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
i
find
the
sweetness
just
dominates
the
experience
for
me
and
thats
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
brew
worth
a
try
nonetheless
though
sunrise
pale
alecolored
with
a
bone
white
freckle
the
aromas
suggest
sweet
sticky
herbs
marzipan
applesauce
and
vanilla
on
the
palate
it
is
a
colossal
struggle
between
oozing
glycerinrich
fruits
apples
pears
plantain
tangerine
and
bold
smoky
resinous
bitterness
the
finish
hums
on
a
bitternut
roasted
banana
peel
and
fruitseed
vector
broad
in
scope
it
is
a
bookends
of
funky
sweetness
and
twiggy
hops
extract
i
might
suggest
letting
this
one
mellow
for
a
year
or
two
hazy
goldenorange
appearance
with
a
creamy
white
head
sweet
candi
sugars
and
bubble
gum
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
yeastiness
and
fruits
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
malty
and
a
bit
acidic
as
well
a
nice
light
fruity
and
doughiness
finish
out
the
flavor
profile
it
is
very
smooth
for
the
alcohol
level
it
has
a
drying
finish
as
well
a
nice
brew
im
a
big
fan
of
the
de
dolle
beers
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
rest
of
them
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
its
a
shame
that
it
is
so
hard
to
come
across
in
the
u
s
de
dolle
is
a
great
example
of
belgiums
craft
beers
this
beer
might
be
a
little
too
much
to
go
drink
all
night
but
its
really
nice
and
interesting
to
start
the
evening
bos
keun
is
fairly
sweet
and
would
therefore
be
a
good
dessert
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
drinkability
is
limited
just
a
tad
by
my
inability
to
handle
sweet
beverages
in
large
quantities
but
one
bottle
at
a
time
should
be
no
problem
besides
its
on
the
expensive
side
its
so
good
though
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
it
again
33
cl
bottle
no
freshness
dating
de
dolles
website
recommends
not
aging
this
beer
for
too
long
ive
had
it
for
a
few
months
so
id
imagine
this
bottle
is
this
years
batch
pours
a
peachy
golden
color
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
volumnous
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
want
to
subside
so
i
can
add
the
rest
of
the
bottle
to
the
glass
lightly
spicy
in
the
aroma
and
some
subdued
applelike
fruitiness
amongst
pale
malts
and
a
slight
honeylike
sweetness
rather
sweet
and
lightly
fruity
and
finishing
spicy
and
a
mild
alcohol
burn
the
beers
character
becomes
better
imo
with
the
addition
of
the
yeast
it
imparts
a
further
applelike
or
passionfruit
esters
and
a
bit
of
nutty
wild
character
to
it
mouthfeel
seems
rather
thick
but
not
offly
so
well
carbonated
it
burps
kind
of
perfumy
light
spicings
are
nice
and
a
good
addition
to
the
beer
rather
nice
but
a
touch
sweet
pretty
clear
light
gold
with
a
tornado
of
bubbles
rising
so
that
for
a
minute
after
being
poured
the
head
is
actually
getting
bigger
instead
of
smaller
as
with
the
other
de
dolles
dont
pour
too
gently
because
some
of
that
carbonation
is
meant
to
come
out
smells
of
sawdust
lime
ginger
als
metal
and
lilac
petals
strongly
aromatic
yet
composed
completely
of
subtleties
taste
is
dry
hay
strongly
phenolic
spice
hints
of
cotton
candy
and
lime
and
makes
a
bite
that
leaves
a
dry
white
pepper
and
grass
lingering
flavor
start
is
lightflavored
mediumbodied
sweetnes
it
slowly
leaves
your
tongue
in
a
n
effervescence
surprisingly
pleasant
for
such
a
high
degree
of
carbonation
very
interesting
and
wonderful
cloudy
amber
clears
as
it
warms
the
eager
head
doesnt
last
very
long
but
is
nice
while
its
there
this
one
has
a
very
spicy
aroma
sweet
cakelike
malt
mixes
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
applelike
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
the
malt
takes
on
a
toast
or
bread
crustlike
character
with
more
of
the
spice
and
apple
fruit
this
is
really
a
tasty
belgian
strong
ale
an
interesting
chemistry
of
a
tornado
under
the
foam
after
you
pour
an
interesting
and
simple
belgian
was
light
on
the
spice
alcohol
well
disguised
cane
sugar
there
with
other
malts
light
yeast
fizzy
light
modest
mouthfeel
easy
on
palate
worth
a
try
id
like
to
note
that
i
do
appreciate
belgian
beers
even
the
wacky
ones
but
this
one
isnt
quite
where
i
like
them
to
be
the
bottle
cap
had
some
mold
under
it
which
was
kind
of
weird
but
im
open
minded
the
appearance
was
fine
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
with
a
nice
white
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
interesting
but
hinted
at
more
complexity
than
i
found
in
the
beer
there
were
traces
of
black
walnut
a
pungency
reminescent
of
vinegar
and
a
little
maltiness
and
an
alcoholic
hint
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
tart
with
some
alcoholic
warmth
but
it
lacked
a
solid
malty
base
and
also
lacked
the
layers
of
complexity
you
get
with
some
of
the
other
soured
beers
like
lambics
and
oldbruin
type
beers
overall
this
wasnt
really
very
drinkable
to
me
it
may
be
great
paired
with
some
foods
but
i
think
ill
pass
next
time
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
quite
a
abit
distinctly
de
dolle
sweet
with
various
cane
sugars
melons
almonds
honey
and
spicy
hops
this
is
an
excellent
strong
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
complexities
going
on
i
poured
out
about
a
centimeter
of
dark
sediment
that
remained
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
even
though
i
swirled
the
bottle
a
few
times
during
the
sampling
nicely
crafted
by
the
folks
at
de
dolle
and
a
belgian
ale
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
the
alcohol
taste
was
a
little
too
strong
for
my
liking
or
maybe
just
my
mood
at
the
time
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
otherwise
the
taste
is
rich
and
straightforward
its
not
overly
complex
there
are
some
subtlties
missing
here
that
i
expect
in
this
style
but
the
sweetness
and
citrus
were
enjoyable
im
going
to
have
this
one
again
and
i
have
a
feeling
my
opinion
of
it
may
go
up
11
2
ounce
bottle
a
very
nice
beer
with
great
complexity
drinkability
well
balanced
and
just
damn
solid
the
beer
decamps
the
330ml
brown
bottle
a
foggy
orange
color
with
a
cyclopean
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
a
velum
like
lace
to
somewhat
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
like
a
fresh
peach
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
malt
to
back
it
up
start
is
sweet
and
nicely
malt
laden
with
the
top
light
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
dastardly
acidic
and
the
hops
masterful
in
their
spiciness
and
the
desert
bleached
bone
dry
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
bitterness
a
unique
beer
and
one
i
find
delightful
this
is
one
hazey
beer
pours
a
mix
of
lemonade
and
tea
with
chunks
and
floaties
everywhere
with
a
creamylike
head
that
leaves
a
light
amount
of
lace
i
get
some
deep
citrius
and
a
touch
of
honey
in
the
aromataste
is
almost
like
apple
cider
and
as
it
warms
more
the
bigger
the
honey
notes
become
this
is
a
very
rustic
looking
beer
well
made
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
might
be
this
was
my
first
ever
true
easter
beer
and
for
my
money
this
is
still
one
of
the
greatest
that
i
have
ever
had
no
wonder
jesus
came
back
from
the
dead
at
easter
if
this
was
available
well
worth
the
coin

but
a
word
of
warning
avoid
the
aged
samples
and
get
it
fresh
to
get
the
best
from
this
one
cloudy
golden
body
bottleconditioned
with
plenty
of
yeast
particules
superbly
laced
huge
foamy
head
rocky
and
leaving
a
trace
on
the
glass
at
each
sip
aroma
is
mostly
yeastysweet
with
light
herbal
hops
noticeable
in
the
shape
of
clover
theres
a
good
green
apple
character
matching
the
honeyish
malt
and
the
yeast
provides
a
mild
farmhouse
character
in
mouth
the
texture
is
silky
and
creamy
the
taste
is
in
line
with
the
aroma
adding
a
balancing
bitter
finish
a
bit
like
a
saison
this
is
overall
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
with
enough
originality
to
be
interesting
throughout
but
still
eminently
drinkable
pours
a
fivefinger
white
bubbly
head
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
amber
color
strong
carbonation
pour
slow
medium
bodied
nose
is
a
slight
caramel
and
spicey
fruit
starts
and
finishes
sweet
the
high
abv
is
not
really
noticeable
pricey
4
70
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
their
site
has
the
abv
at
8
9
seems
fairly
well
done
absolutely
strange
but
thats
part
of
the
allure
just
like
the
huge
guy
that
gave
me
this
bottle
feel
is
nearly
full
with
a
fluffy
texturing
within
most
of
its
carbonation
a
nice
spicy
twinge
and
mild
hop
flesh
maintains
in
the
finish
and
comes
across
pretty
darn
smooth
and
even
creamy
at
times
front
mostly
there
overall
a
fine
fine
ale
one
id
drink
again
and
again
with
no
problem
a
very
nice
drinker
eh
twas
gone
in
no
time
i
have
found
honey
in
beers
to
be
overdone
in
almost
every
one
i
have
tried
but
this
one
is
well
balanced
i
was
very
impressed
at
how
it
was
there
but
not
dominant
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
you
have
to
give
it
a
whirl
drinkability
is
good
but
not
exceptional
it
is
a
dark
golden
color
with
some
haze
and
a
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
caramelized
malts
and
there
is
a
smokey
quality
to
it
as
well
the
caramelized
malts
produce
a
sweet
flavor
that
is
accented
with
candied
sugar
apple
and
floral
notes
and
a
smokey
taste
it
finishes
with
some
alcohol
and
the
smokiness
lingers
faboulous
drinkability
with
complexity
that
does
not
interfere
but
does
not
bore
gimme
more
apple
skin
and
the
dull
white
scraps
from
the
inside
of
orange
peel
light
a
bit
nutty
very
yeasty
begins
sweet
finishes
with
an
apple
liqueor
and
grassy
flavor
cleans
up
remarkably
well
dont
need
to
expound
too
much
on
its
virtues
theyre
very
evident
carefully
poured
from
an
undisturbed
bottle
the
bos
keun
delivers
a
clear
golden
body
beneath
a
tall
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
that
slowly
dissolves
into
a
wide
collar
and
leaves
short
thin
splashes
of
lace
about
the
glass
tiny
bubbles
rise
in
plumes
from
the
base
of
the
goblet
indicating
a
very
fine
and
somewhat
effervescent
bottleconditioned
carbonation
the
aroma
is
mesmerizing
in
its
sweet
fruitiness
its
clearly
candyish
but
also
laced
with
an
odd
combination
of
light
and
dark
fruits
apples
dates
as
expected
its
lightly
zesty
on
the
tongue
with
a
very
fine
somewhat
effervescent
carbonation
a
touch
of
caramel
maltiness
and
some
vanilla
comes
into
play
in
the
flavor
and
its
not
as
candyish
as
the
nose
suggests
but
still
sweet
the
fruitiness
however
remains
with
some
crisp
green
apple
that
works
well
with
the
emerging
note
of
alcohol
and
some
dates
that
emerge
in
the
aftertaste
still
it
finishes
surprisingly
dry
for
such
a
sweet
beer
a
rich
and
exciting
beer
for
spring
the
cap
comes
off
with
authority
but
the
pour
leads
to
less
head
than
indicated
by
the
uncorking
sound
nonethless
a
nice
looking
dense
yet
uniformly
bubbly
cream
colored
head
forms
atop
the
volcanic
slightly
hazed
gold
laboratory
experiment
below
in
other
words
this
beer
looks
like
it
has
hot
flame
torching
it
from
below
vigorous
carbonation
is
visible
to
say
the
least
aroma
is
a
sweetly
spiced
concoction
of
dough
yeast
and
bubblegum
esters
quite
nice
not
surprisingly
the
taste
is
a
bit
caustic
but
not
overbearing
in
the
context
of
the
other
flavors
the
heat
not
only
comes
from
ethanol
but
probably
a
few
higher
alcohols
and
esters
as
well
a
sweet
candied
like
blanket
cloaks
that
harshness
and
damn
near
swallows
it
up
at
times
this
beer
has
a
little
of
that
tale
of
two
cities
thing
going
on
best
of
times
worst
of
times
abrasive
yet
mellow
harsh
yet
mild
and
drinkable
fiery
yet
soothing
acetic
acid
mixed
with
sucrose
corrosive
yet
healing
at
the
same
time
ill
tell
ya
what
to
summarize
i
think
this
is
good
stuff
pours
a
dull
amber
pale
with
a
nice
firm
white
head
smells
sweet
woodsy
like
bbq
maple
chips
some
nuts
and
spice
in
the
background
tastes
of
overripe
fruit
banana
pear
roasted
chestnuts
then
the
yeast
flavors
fill
in
to
balance
out
the
malt
flavors
overall
another
nice
offering
from
de
dolle
definitely
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
for
your
palate
highly
recommended
oh
yeah
i
like
that
wacky
bunny
on
the
label
too
cloudy
but
glowing
peach
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
that
leaves
wonderful
trails
of
lace
down
the
glass
and
holds
up
very
well
nose
is
a
blend
of
spicy
musty
funkiness
with
just
a
subtle
hint
at
dried
fruit
i
sensed
somewhat
of
a
smokiness
lingering
in
the
aromatics
which
im
guessing
is
from
the
age
of
this
beer
and
the
decreased
presence
of
its
hop
character
flavorwise
i
got
tart
herbal
citrus
with
somewhat
of
a
bitter
lemon
rind
character
and
a
bonedry
biting
finish
as
the
beer
approached
standard
room
temperature
some
fruity
apricot
notes
became
more
apparent
but
i
never
experienced
the
honey
flavor
others
note
the
yeast
character
never
strays
too
far
and
its
definitely
that
of
the
aged
variety
the
highly
carbonated
prickly
mouthfeel
was
quite
nice
but
the
dry
tanginess
of
this
beer
and
the
seemingly
off
flavors
kept
it
from
being
overly
drinkable
i
may
very
well
have
sampled
a
bottle
that
was
indeed
past
its
prime
as
this
is
the
only
beer
with
which
ive
been
disappointed
from
de
dolle
it
did
however
have
some
solid
attributes
but
i
think
it
may
need
to
be
drunk
fresh
rather
than
aged
like
this
particular
bottle
a
hazy
copperorange
color
pours
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
honey
slight
vinegar
fresh
pressed
apple
cider
surprisingly
the
cider
is
the
predominant
aroma
of
this
beer
a
lightly
sweet
taste
with
a
bit
of
acidic
sourness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
refreshing
fruity
ale
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
nice
fresh
ripe
apple
a
hint
of
mustiness
in
the
finish
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
this
is
really
good
i
wish
it
was
easily
available
and
cheap
maybe
a
little
unbalanced
but
good
bottle

comments

sorry
to
lowball
this
one
without
a
lot
of
constructive
criticism
but
this
just
left
me
scratching
my
head
fantabulous
pours
a
murky
goldenorange
with
a
gigantic
frothy
foam
aroma
is
absolutely
killer
with
a
fairly
strong
alcoholic
smell
yeasty
and
estery
incredibly
complex
beer
sharp
citrusy
flavor
and
earthy
musty
it
ends
slightly
sweet
and
dry
very
warming
supposed
to
be
an
easter
beer
but
can
definitely
be
had
year
round
this
stuff
is
great
but
by
no
means
cheap
the
bunny
on
the
bottle
art
freaked
me
out
a
bit
but
this
is
a
really
great
belgian
souce

maybe
i
will
try
it
again
or
let
it
sit

what
else
is

for
this

aftertaste
is

with
a

bite
interesting
beer
this
brew
poured
a
large
head
of
finely
sized
white
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
light
brown
body
it
had
a
mild
malt
aroma
and
a
complex
fruity
citrousy
flavor
with
banana
clove
malt
and
caramel
notes
and
i
hate
having
to
add
length
to
my
comments
just
to
get
them
past
the
silly
filter
it
pours
an
extremely
eyepleasing
goldenbrown
with
a
fat
head
that
leaves
a
trail
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
spicypeppery
with
some
nice
fruit
scent
in
the
mix
after
a
nice
leadup
with
the
appearance
and
smell
the
taste
meets
expectations
it
has
an
amazing
mix
of
ripe
fruit
flavors
and
an
almost
portlike
flavor
perhaps
a
beer
with
the
warming
qualities
of
bos
keun
wasnt
the
best
choice
for
a
warm
midjune
evening
but
this
is
a
stunning
beer
regardless
of
when
its
drunk
it
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
okay
i
have
been
hesitant
to
buy
this
due
to
the
crazy
looking
bunny
on
it
wasnt
sure
if
it
was
okay
to
drink
if
after
easter
without
the
bunny
coming
after
to
me
well
the
head
on
this
beer
was
huge
to
say
the
least
what
little
beer
i
could
see
under
the
massive
foamy
white
head
that
at
least
drifted
down
quicklyleaving
spider
like
lacewas
a
hazy
gold
color
an
good
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
which
would
stand
to
reason
giving
the
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
elements
of
hops
banana
caramel
and
bread
a
flavor
of
hops
and
cirtrus
with
some
clove
present
with
a
touch
of
pepper
a
touch
astrigent
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
aroma
almost
leaves
you
expecting
more
finish
is
generous
sweet
and
very
lovely
body
texture
balance
all
were
well
accounted
for
and
contributed
to
a
remarkably
delicious
and
satisfying
ale

the

o
an
extravagant
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
i
have
a
beer
friend
whom
i
have
not
known
for
an
extraordinarily
long
time
but
whos
opinion
i
respect
very
much
he
regards
de
dolle
as
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
and
the
stille
nacht
their
best
beer
thats
high
praise
from
anyone
especially
him
so
at
long
last
i
finally
get
to
drink
one
of
these
on
tap
at
the
bull
and
bush
a
real
treat
once
the
server
got
it
right
hazy
and
quite
pale
in
the
glass
not
sure
why
i
expected
it
to
be
darker
but
its
cloudy
but
bright
not
thick
at
all
almost
delicate
looking
and
not
that
abv
ever
has
a
look
but
this
looks
too
light
for
12
abv
head
is
thick
as
shaving
cream
but
not
as
white
it
stands
tall
like
beaten
eggs
ready
to
be
folded
into
a
cake
batter
it
smells
unexpected
as
well
hoppy
but
only
really
as
far
as
the
belgians
ever
take
it
in
that
regard
less
bitter
more
leafy
grassy
and
fully
yeasty
it
smells
tart
like
good
lemonade
but
still
with
that
estery
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
and
complexity
there
is
a
hair
in
me
that
thinks
this
has
some
wild
in
it
not
pitched
bacteria
but
some
wild
strain
that
got
worked
in
one
way
or
another
very
complex
and
unique
to
my
nose
the
taste
is
the
same
new
but
enticing
taunting
almost
the
hype
around
this
one
which
is
more
internal
in
my
circle
than
external
i
think
maybe
not
had
this
one
highly
anticipated
and
first
sip
shows
why
that
tartness
is
there
in
the
finish
with
even
a
moderate
acidity
usually
the
strong
belgians
especially
the
tripel
types
the
pale
ones
have
tons
of
sugars
added
for
extra
fermentables
or
such
a
high
original
gravity
as
to
never
quite
get
dried
out
enough
for
my
tastes
not
this
one
and
that
is
its
immediate
success
for
me
its
dry
but
its
huge
but
its
delicate
and
rich
its
a
bunch
of
caucophanous
juxtapositions
that
resolve
in
beautiful
synchronicity
splendid
lemon
is
there
straw
hay
clover
plantain
white
pepper
mild

even

floor
this
is
wonderful
beer
not
fully
understood
but
entirely
appreciated
is
it
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
think
so
no
but
it
is
something
to
be
revered
and
treasured
and
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
a
touch
sweet
but
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
2009
vintage
not
a
bad
beer
smooth
for
the
alcohol
content
not
much
of
a
fan
overall
its
a
belgian
beer
with
lots
of
fruitiness
rjt
overall
im
glad
this
is
a
winter
beer
since
if
it
were
available
all
year
round
id
be
drinking
rather
a
lot
of
it
and
end
up
pickling
myself
in
the
process
it
is
i
suspect
rather
an
acquired
taste
a
sweet
tooth
certainly
helps
as
its
quite
sugary
and
heavy
that
said
its
well
worth
tracking
down
and
trying
if
the
chance
presents
itself
definitely
worth
taking
your
time
over
especially
at
12
abv
oh
my
goodness
happy
2015
and
what
a
way
to
kick
it
off
didnt
expect
such
a
big
beer
tho
12
tasty
but
a
sweettooth
is
imperative
strong
so
take
some
time
with
it
hard
to
rate
boozy
flat
nothing
that
can
make
wanna
finish
the
beer
from
the
glass
taste
of
this
brew
is
complex
alcohol
is
present
from
the
very
beginning
and
lingers
till
the
end
very
yeasty
lots
of
spices
on
my
tongue
cinnamon
clove
pepper
burned
malt
sugar
honey
and
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
which
enhances
the
sweetness
of
the
sugar
long
aftertaste
of
mostly
sugar
and
alcohol
in
my
opinion
they
push
it
too
far
the
beer
appears
unbalanced
to
me
sugar
and
alcohol
are
too
present
they
dominate
all
the
other
ingredients
and
interrupt
the
possible
complexity
what
a
beautiful
belgium
beer
a
cloudy
brown
amber
with
a
large
long
lasting
white
head
on
the
pour
caramel
malt
belgian
yeast
dark
fruit
notes
along
with
some
citrus
orange
fruity
esters
there
is
some
brown
sugar
and
sweet
alcohol
flavors
with
mild
bitterness
a
medium
body
a
smooth
and
mild
sticky
sweet
caramel
orange
bitterness
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
full
flavored
overall
a
very
well
made
and
tasty
ale
o
a
really
good
and
very
strong
and
flavorful
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
this
if
i
came
across
it
again
its
sweet
warming
bitter
and
interesting
o
not
a
ton
of
the
classic
de
dolle
funk
found
at
the
forefront
here
but
its
a
stellar
creeper
beer
one
of
the
most
satisfying
simple
malty
strong
belgian
beers
youll
find
could
very
well
be
the
zeus
of
malt
liquors
o
what
an
amazing
beer
i
recommend
aging
one
for
a
long
time
and
enjoy
has
a
lot
to
offer
very
complex
m
smooth
consistent
full
d
amazing
beer
to
sip
on
just
when
i
thought
i
hadnt
had
a
belgian
beer
in
some
time
that
really
blew
my
socks
off
o
really
nice
bspa
super
high
abv
for
one
in
fact
but
it
doesnt
detract
much
doesnt
get
too
syrupy
too
heavy
or
too
overpowering
no
way
would
i
assume
12
for
that
matter
id
say
810
tops
love
the
honey
flavor
in
this
one
even
though
im
pretty
sure
theres
no
actual
honey
in
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
bspas
right
off
the
bat
overall
i
had
to
look
at
the
bottle
again
there
is
now
way
this
is
12
percent
abv
this
drinks
like
it
is
at
least
7
notice
i
didnt
say
there
was
any
booze
in
the
taste
this
is
very
delicious
despite
the
appearance
some
dont
like
chunks
in
their
beer
but
that
was
not
a
problem
with
this
guy
i
feel
this
could
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
paired
with
a
nice
fruit
salad
this
refreshed
my
love
for
belgian
strong
ales
this
is
my
new
favorite
bspa
this
brew
is
recommended
overall
very
very
good
excellent
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
light
tartness
with
a
hint
of
funky
yeast
on
the
finish
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites

this
is

perfectly
anyone
who
thinks
belgian
strong

ales
have
to
taste
like
duvel
is
in
for
a
shocker
if
they
try
this
if
i
come
across
another

of
it
theres
not

im
passing

good
beer
but
very

definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
think
you
might
i
agree
if
you
get
it
fresh
that
it
needs
some
aging
this
is
the
only
reason
i
would
buy
it
again
batch
not

it
clings
nicely
to
the
side

faint

very
pleasant
slightly
sweet
deliciously
malty
with

fantastic

beverage
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
fresh
one
to
compare
but
i
imagine
that
age
has
done
wonders
on
this
as
it
is
so
smooth
the
greatest
think
is
it
was
already
five
years
old
when
i
bought
it
for
5
truly
a
steal
rich
smooth
warming
light
effervescence
nearly
full
bodied
a
solid
coating
of
the
upper
palate
develops
quickly
cloying
is
the
word
i
want
only
real
knock
against
it
this
may
be
my
favorite
beer
ever
which
is
saying
a
lot
i
had
a
2008
a
few
nights
ago
which
was
wonderful
so
i
had
to
try
the
06
for
comparison
it
just
keeps
getting
better
with
age
highly
recommend
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
4
bottles
of
2010
on
the
way
home
a
little
something
for
later
pours
a
significantly
darker
amberbrown
smells
like
apple
pie
and
tastes
like
it
too
no
cinnamon
but
the
apples
and
buttery
crust
are
both
there
not
nearly
as
tasty
as
the
fresher
version
but
interesting
in
its
own
right
id
drop
the
rating
on
the
2009
down
to
about
a
3

this

ages
with
the
best
if
them
ive
had
older

i
like
even
better
than
these

integrates
the
flavors

really
liking
this
would
love
to
try
the
reserva
but
not
gonna
do
that
level
of
whale
hunting
had
it
at
a
restaurant
and
bought
it
again
when
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
it
in
a
store
i
forgot
how
fierce
this
beer
was
the
label
implies
a
playful
holiday
ale
but
its
far
from
that
a
huge
potent
masterpiece
something
of
a
liquid

layered
and
complex
and
densely
packed
yeasty
banana
clove
honey
booze
herbal

nice
to
try
this
one
again
fullbodied

belgian
ale
really
enjoyed
it
the
first
time
but
now
just
find
it
too

boozy

which
dulls

sweetness

strong
pale
ale
with
its
tremendous
sweetness
yeast
fruit
potent
ethanol
and
mild
bitterness
this
is
probably
not
a
repeat
bottle
for
the
price
pours
a
hazed
golden
apricot
with
a
foamy
white
head
thick
lace
and
good
retention
aroma
of
bubblegum
yeast
peach
booze
banana
and
bread
medium
thick
body
heavy
carbonation
and
a
soft
body
flavor
is
hotter
than
nose
suggested
with
a
ton
of
fruit
grape
peach
pear
and
bubblegum
and
bready
malt
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
dangerously
well
hidden
high
abv
and
lots
of
nice
fruity
belgian
flavours
this
is
a
medium
to
fuller
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
lighter
level
of
carbonation
for
being
what
i
believe
is
a
10
year
old
bottle
the
alcohol
has
not
mellowed
all
that
much
in
this
offering
regardless
it
is
a
pretty
fantastic
brew
and
one
i
will
be
sure
to
purchase
more
of
when
i
get
the
opportunity
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
and
warms
you
up
as
this
is
a
sipper
and
not
something
you
would
quaff
but
a
treat
to
be
savored
fantastic
beer
just
superb
really
hides
the
alc
i
guessed
it
at
8
its
just
right
in
all
the
ways
it
tries
to
be
and
they
all
play
well
together
highest
recommend
overall
an
awesome
belgian
strong
pale
ale
very
well
balanced
between
fruit
and
spice
with
no
booziness
overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
youd
think
this
would
be
a
sipper
given
the
high
sweetness
and
abv
but
its
surprisingly
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
would
really
like
to
try
the
reserva
version
as
the
beer
closes
i
dont
feel
that
i
have
fully
explored
all
of
the
beers
slight
nuances
or
its
powerful
complexities
i
simply
hope
that
this
review
has
given
you
a
glimpse
into
the
shallow
impressions
that
i
gained
from
this
session
still
a
heightened
sense
of
dryness
even
at
the
determent
of
10
abv
just
might
improve
its
character
cheers
overall
that
nose
writes
a
check
the
rest
of
the
beer
cant
cash
wouldnt
buy
again
but
would
buy
a
candle
smelling
like
it
anytime
overall
kinda
like
they
tried
to
make
an
imperial
tripel
harsh
finish
along
with
all
sorts
of
yeasty
biproducts
it
does
make
for
an
interesting
drink
though
o
big
fat
meh
for
me
here
i
was
very
underwhelmed
by
this
one
not
objectionable
flavors
perhaps
but
the
alcohol
was
too
much
ive
got
another
bottle
to
sit
on
likely
for
another
year
will
update
if
its
significantly
different
o
a
very
pleasing
intense
and
complex
beer
has
many
of
the
same
characteristics
as
bush
blond
but
seems
to
be
more
smooth
and
complex
overall
it
does
not
hide
its
alcohol
at
all
but
allows
it
to
remain
blatant
and
blend
with
the
overall
sweetness
really
awesome
beer
glad
i
finally
drank
this
bottle
at
the
time
that
i
did
should
really
stock
up
on
this
one
next
time
i
see
it
complexity
is
brilliant
here
a
rustygolden
ale
topped
with
a
bubbly
white
head
tons
of
carbonation
with
some
yeasty
particles
suspended
within
foamy
lacing
is
washed
away
and
then
reappears
with
each
sip
aromas
are
bready
yeast
floral
fruity
grape
juice
apple
juice
booze
is
nonexistent
flavors
do
not
disappoint
very
sweet
with
honey
apple
white
grape
juice
pear
peach
bready
malt
belgian
yeast
slight
spiciness
floral
notes
as
well
buttery
again
booze
is
nonexistent
other
than
being
warming
mouthfeel
is
creamy
rich
with
plenty
of
carbonation
finishes
semidry
and
very
clean
only
making
its
second
appearance
as
a
christmas
eve
beer
for
me
but
ill
make
it
a
ritual
and
have
it
again
each
year
hopefully
for
many
years
to
come
o
overall
a
delicious
yet
somewhat
overwhelming
beer
for
me
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
strong
belgian
pale
so
my
palate
is
still
piecing
it
all
together
not
sure
what
makes
this
their
christmas
holiday
beer
although
i
detect
some
spicyness
but
could
simply
be
from
the
yeast
i
do
know
it
has
a
nice
winter
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
on
a
25
degree
day
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
definitely
well
crafted
and
a
little
different
very
enjoyable
take
o
a
decent
beer
considering
the
noticeable
alcohol
presence
but
this
could
stand
to
age
for
another
510
years
i
think
it
will
be
even
better
once
it
mellows
a
bit
overall
this
beer
blurs
the
line
between
wine
and
beer
its
real
fascinating
very
enjoyable
o
one
the
best
belgian
ales
ive
had
world
class
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
honey
color
with
some
floaties
thin
coating
of
foam
smells
of
plum
with
a
sharp
alcohol
note
some
caramel
and
roast
very
rich
and
sweet
but
still
quite
hot
good
quadbarleywine
hybrid
but
could
still
mellow
a
bit
o
this
beer
is
just
awesome
and
im
not
sure
there
is
one
better
on
earth
at
least
its
the
best
barleywine
ever
this
is
the
richest
tastiest
beer
ive
ever
drunk
it
seems
even
better
each
time
i
drink
one
and
aging
works
wonders
with
this
brew
i
just
cant
imagine
drinking
something
better
than
the
one
from
1987
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
o
great
as
a
kind
of
sweet
snack
in
small
quantities
not
that
youd
be
drinking
a
pint
of
it
anyway
i
feel
that
its
not
as
complex
as
its
reputation
might
entail
but
its
a
fine
beer
id
probably
prefer
an
oer
or
arabier
on
most
days
though
and
the
oerbier
special
reserva
on
any
day
the
palate
opens
pretty
big
and
sweet
with
honey
brown
sugar
and
some
spices
age
has
wiped
out
the
nugget
hop
flavor
muted
the
bitterness
and
has
added
mild
leathery
and
earthy
notes
the
alcohol
while
well
hidden
is
fairly
obvious
compromising
sobriety
rather
quickly
the
midpalate
is
where
all
the
complexity
is
expressed
honey
stewed
fruits
peaches
grapes
pears
some
brown
sugar
as
well
as
come
caramel
are
all
present
id
say
this
is
too
sweet
but
for
the
leather
that
tames
this
just
a
hair
mediumfull
in
body
with
rather
high
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
long
sweet
finish
almost
saccharine
in
some
ways
along
with
some
spice
despite
that
its
very
enjoyable
though
best
split
two
ways
imo
not
your
prototypical
bspa
slightly
lower
numbers
for
taste
because
of
the
light
oxidation
but
still
a
stellar
ale
honey
is
at
the
forefront
here
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
medicinality
isnt
present
in
the
taste
would
love
to
try
it
with
5
years
of
age
one
of
the
best
holiday
beers
ive
had
nothing
really
distinguishes
it
as
a
christmas
beer
aside
from
the
name
but
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
its
right
up
there
with
the
best
ive
had
o
trying
to
be
objective
and
not
finding
a
lot
of
enjoyment
here
balance
of
flavors
not
hitting
me
right
maybe
the
age
of
the
bottle
andor
storage
are
affecting
it
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
recent
tasting
2008
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
some
floaties
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
bread
fruit
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
dark
fruit
bread
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
all
aspects
of
this
one
were
very
good
and
quite
inviting
the
flavor
however
was
a
little
above
and
beyond
the
rest
of
the
brew
it
was
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
still
had
a
nice
alcohol
sweetness
bite
on
the
followthrough
definitely
a
must
try
from
this
vintage
o
a
nice
strong
ale
a
real
winter
warmer
o
i
have
had
this
one
in
the
past
and
it
was
much
better
than
this
bottle
i
will
have
to
give
this
one
another
chance
in
the
future
because
this
bottle
did
not
do
it
justice
bottled
2000
drank
summer
2011
pours
golden
orange
mostly
transparent
with
thin
off
white
head
nose
has
lots
of
malt
sweetness
caramel
some
sweet
scotch
with
light
dark
fruits
in
back
the
flavor
adds
more
wood
notes
and
is
far
sweeter
than
expected
full
bodied
syrupy
and
creamy
with
a
well
balanced
carbonation
a
little
sweet
interesting
scotch
notes
overall
an
excellent
beer
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
a
standout
from
a
great
brewery
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
rich
with
creamy
carbonation
it
maintains
its
drinkability
without
being
overly
heavy
a
tasty
winter
brew
that
is
worthy
of
a
good
celebration
well
worth
seeking
out
love
me
some
de
dolle
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
complex
taste
that
just
comes
alive
in
your
mouth
i
am
amazed
that
the
abv
is
so
high
it
really
does
not
taste
like
it
o
this
beer
is
almost
overwhelmingly
complex
and
maybe
this
is
what
prevented
me
from
giving
it
an
even
higher
score
still
it
is
greatly
balanced
and
amazingly
drinkable
given
its
character
and
abv
a
top
notch
beer
o
a
beer
to
think
about
not
for
everyone
but
its
worth
a
shot
even
at
6
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
overall
a
very
nice
beer
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
last
year
this
time
so
it
has
about
a
year
of
age
on
it
hazy
yelloworange
pour
with
two
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
with
excellent
lacing
yeasty
fruity
belgian
nose
with
hints
of
grass
apricots
orange
zest
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
lemon
very
bold
tart
yeasty
almost
medicinal
at
first
sip
hints
of
candied
fruit
specifically
pineapple
along
with
cinnamon
phenols
orange
zest
raisins
and
a
touch
of
pepper
very
complex
well
balanced
and
ever
changing
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
for
me
but
the
drinkability
is
crazy
for
a
12
abv
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
draws
you
to
it
normally
this
would
be
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
for
some
reason
its
not
cant
wait
for
next
weeks
o
b
e
r
kerstbierfestival
to
get
some
more
taste
mellow
but
bold
alcohol
taste
with
a
sweet
citrus
fruit
slight
biter
finish
o
perfect
christmas
brew
in
my
mind
cereal
worthy
definitely
i
can
imagine
this
one
with
christmas
dinner
oh
baby
o
it
was
good
but
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
i
think
with
some
more
balance
it
would
be
top
notch
definitely
doesnt
drink
like
a
12
beer
big
foamy
white
head
on
this
one
with
a
nice
golden
colored
body
the
smell
of
this
beer
has
some
good
belgian
yeast
aromas
with
some
bread
and
some
spicy
notes
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nice
with
a
good
amount
of
grainy
flavors
with
some
soft
banana
flavors
in
there
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
with
some
light
carbonation
in
there
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
someday
d
a
solid
little
beer
if
the
carbonation
level
was
not
so
robust
this
would
get
top
marks
for
the
style
though
i
bet
this
is
just
divine
with
a
few
years
on
it
a
delightful
fruity
pale
belgiam
with
highly
exaggerated
yeast
flavours
excellent
o
kick
ass
time
has
treated
this
very
well
at
4
a
bottle
i
will
get
more
drink
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
will
have
to
wrangle
a
few
more
bottles
for
the
holidays
poured
a
1
14
white
head
hazy
light
apricot
colored
body
the
smell
is
very
complex
and
fruity
dried
fruit
pineapple
fig
citrus
light
malt
the
taste
includes
all
the
above
plus
spices
like
ginger
and
some
molasses
medium
weight
body
and
a
substantially
long
finish
its
a
powerhouse
of
a
pale
ale
packing
the
punch
of
a
quad
amazingly
the
12
alcohol
is
well
hidden
among
all
the
flavor
so
watch
out
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
not
in
the
mood
it
seems
o
i
like
this
beer
but
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
balance
im
not
sure
i
could
have
handled
it
fresh
welldone
but
a
little
overpowering
for
my
taste
i
would
put
this
on
the
good
side
of
belgian
beers
for
me
which
is
significant
but
because
they
arent
normally
my
bag
its
definitely
tasty
and
i
like
the
complexity
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
alcohol
heat
making
me
think
that
i
might
have
liked
the
8
version
more
thank
god
you
can
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
with
this
since
its
12
abv
is
very
well
hidden
although
you
get
a
sense
that
something
is
up
definitely
dont
pound
this
one
i
think
it
would
pound
you
back
id
love
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
and
let
them
cellar
think
ill
look
very
nice
beer
reading
through
my
notes
makes
me
afraid
to
try
this
beer
again
id
be
so
disappointed
to
not
find
god
again
in
a
glass
of
stille
nacht
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
great
carbonation
there
was
a
nice
slickness
to
it
awesome
beer
overall
a
fantastic
beer
cant
wait
to
age
this
one
o
de
dolle
can
put
together
one
hell
of
a
brew
as
complex
as
they
get
and
yet
accessible
enough
for
the
lay
person
to
enjoy
a
killer
brew
and
one
id
like
to
lay
down
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
it
does
overall
the
score
is
to
style
as
a
strong
pale
ale
if
it
was
a
belgian
barleywine
i
would
probably
bump
them
up
a
little
i
love
de
dolle
brouwers
but
this
is
just
not
a
style
of
beer
that
hits
my
sweet
spot
so
to
say
o
delightfully
complex
quadlike
qualities
in
a
lighter
belgian
but
by
no
means
a
light
beverage
a
serious
sipper
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
distracting
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
spinrsx
shared
it
with
me
and
it
was
all
it
was
met
to
me
would
seak
out
again
for
sure
overall
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
beer
that
wowd
me
as
much
as
this
did
the
flavours
are
amazing
and
the
taste
is
very
complex
pretty
much
everything
about
the
beer
is
near
perfect
and
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
anytime
this
beer
falls
into
the
must
try
category
for
sure
ws
overall
an
excellent
and
complex
example
of
the
style
from
the
funky
wild
aroma
through
the
spicy
aroma
and
flavor
through
the
sweet
balanced
and
warm
finish
this
brew
is
highlyrecommended
overall
always
one
of
the
best
nice
to
be
able
to
get
it
when
i
want
now
o
my
favorite
beer
for
the
style
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
belgian
art
of
brewing
cheers
stille
nacht
is
an
unplaceable
awesome
beer
for
me
i
think
all
of
de
dolles
beers
are
like
this
to
a
certain
degree
but
stille
nacht
does
something
the
others
dont
after
finishing
almost
any
of
de
dolles
beers
i
inevitably
look
back
on
what
just
happened
with
awe
and
wonder
where
that
awesome
drink
i
just
had
in
my
hand
disappeared
to
now
thats
a
high
compliment
but
with
this
particular
de
dolle
beer
im
happy
to
find
that
this
statement
does
not
apply
this
beer
more
than
any
of
their
others
strikes
a
balance
in
which
im
perfectly
happy
to
see
the
drink
go
because
the
last
sip
comes
just
when
i
hope
it
will
its
just
as
satisfying
as
it
needs
to
be
what
a
great
brewery
overall
absurdly
well
balanced
this
beer
has
consistently
blown
me
away
id
say
the
09
vintages
will
still
be
drinking
miraculously
through
at
least
2013
though
most
certainly
longer
under
ideal
conditions
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
ever
had
world
class
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
ridiculously
well
hidden
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
while
this
is
an
extremely
good
beer
and
although
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
hot
its
only
a
minor
gripeit
doesnt
put
me
off
very
much
at
all
i
could
smell
this
all
day
definitely
a
heady
little
treat
love
it
dhands
down
this
is
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
i
had
almost
given
up
on
this
style
after
finding
duvel
la
chouffe
gnommegang
don
de
dieu
and
other
to
be
only
mediocre
and
not
very
drinkable
this
is
perfect
i
love
it
there
are
no
negative
side
tastes
the
only
bad
thing
is
that
this
bottle
isnt
large
enough
i
genuinely
could
drink
this
all
night
long
drinkability
and
overall
impression
with
this
abv
and
the
overall
level
of
sweetness
this
is
definitely
a
one
a
night
beer
sipping
had
to
be
taken
slowly
but
was
a
pleasure
each
time
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
one
day
and
maybe
even
to
getting
a
few
to
age
a
bit
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
beer
that
pushes
the
limits
and
walks
the
thin
line
between
being
too
sweet
and
well
balanced
at
the
moment
this
is
balanced
just
right
for
the
bitterness
to
prevent
the
sweetness
from
cloying
full
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
boozier
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
but
what
did
i
expect
when
the
abv
is
12
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
i
suppose
i
could
see
this
beer
really
blowing
some
people
away
if
they
happen
to
be
looking
for
just
these
aspects
heavy
bitterness
lots
of
carbonation
deep
development
of
yeasty
flavor
and
i
would
seek
out
more
beer
by
this
brewery
for
my
tastes
though
theres
many
better
and
cheaper
bspas
available
so
i
doubt
ill
return
to
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
nice
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
lasts
very
tiny
and
thin
lace
strands
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
tropical
fruits
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
of
malt
candied
fruits
spices
and
yeast
extreme
level
of
carbonation
here
it
seems
like
this
is
more
carbonated
than
a
soda
would
be
even
very
prickly
and
fizzy
on
the
throat
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
meant
to
be
this
carbonated
but
i
do
not
care
for
this
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
drink
down
overall
this
a
good
beer
but
the
carbonation
is
not
what
i
expected
from
this
style
d
this
reaffirms
my
belief
that
after
enough
time
most
beers
start
to
taste
the
same
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
04
westy
i
had
yesterday
easy
to
drink
4oz
but
id
rather
have
this
fresh
jd
enjoy
this
one
but
not
as
much
as
de
dolles
other
offerings
its
a
very
big
beer
note
2009
vintage
d
a
pretty
awesome
belgian
strong
pale
im
definitely
going
to
sit
on
a
few
of
these
and
see
what
some
age
can
do
to
the
mellowing
out
the
alcohol
a
bit
could
make
this
beer
even
more
incredible
probably
the
most
drinkable
12
beer
ive
had
reminded
by
the
feeling
afterwards
this
is
a
12
abv
beer
and
that
has
been
well
hidden
by
the
sweetsouryeasty
flavors
of
this
most
interesting
winter
ale
this
has
been
one
of
my
goto
winter
ales
and
continues
to
be
that
with
so
many
flavors
and
things
happening
on
my
tongue
its
hard
not
to
see
what
the
next
bottle
will
bring
to
my
taste
buds
pours
a
very
murky
cant
see
through
at
all
orange
color
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
scent
is
spicy
with
some
very
strong
sweet
fruit
aromas
i
get
a
lot
of
orange
peel
bananas
and
green
apples
there
is
also
some
belgian
yeast
aromas
taste
is
very
yeasty
and
a
bit
funky
lots
of
delicious
spice
with
some
funk
and
breadlike
characters
i
get
coriander
and
banana
along
with
orange
peel
slightly
sour
green
apples
white
grapes
and
sweet
honey
tons
of
flavors
in
this
beer
and
the
12abv
is
insanely
wellhidden
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
full
bodied
with
immense
flavor
well
carbonated
and
complex
drinks
so
damn
easily
drinkability
is
scary
high
for
such
a
big
beer
d
just
too
sweet
and
boozy
to
go
very
high
here
no
way
would
i
have
been
able
to
drink
more
than
1
bottle
and
i
am
a
real
fan
of
big
high
abv
beers
light
carbonation
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
for
the
abv
that
this
clocks
in
at
easily
recommendable
to
try
d
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
enormous
and
you
want
to
savor
every
last
drop
the
alcohol
plays
its
role
beautifully
and
in
perfect
balance
with
every
other
component
im
not
sure
id
pair
this
with
food
it
should
be
enjoyed
on
a
stage
by
itself
d
opened
two
bottles
at
onceone
for
me
and
one
for
the
missus
she
did
not
like
it
where
is
my
st
bernardus
abt
12
so
i
got
both
11
5
oz
bottles
feeling
pretty
good
halfway
through
the
2nd
bottle
but
thats
probably
my
limit
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
two
as
its
too
sweet
almost
better
as
an
after
dinner
beer
notes
think
this
is
mislabeled
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
its
incredibly
pale
d
overall
this
is
a
nice
belgian
dark
but
the
alcohol
shines
through
a
bit
too
much
i
loved
the
smell
and
it
looked
great
but
the
taste
and
alcohol
warmth
knocked
it
down
a
bit
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
go
through
any
hassel
to
buy
maybe
ill
pick
one
up
for
the
cellar
d
this
is
too
big
to
have
one
of
these
alone
in
my
opinion
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
getting
through
the
whole
bottle
myself
was
semi
difficult
a
nice
beer
that
ill
have
to
get
again
and
age
for
years
and
years
before
cracking
it
open
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
cap
shows
this
beer
was
bottled
in
2008
been
wanting
to
try
this
winter
warmer
for
some
time
now
the
beer
pours
orange
amber
with
a
great
big
lowdensity
foamy
head
which
lasted
pretty
much
throughout
leaving
nice
laces
every
sip
the
aroma
is
complex
sweet
malt
white
candy
and
a
hint
of
tangerine
fill
out
the
fruit
flavors
leather
and
wood
lend
a
certain
sophistication
to
the
nose
strong
caramel
hints
at
a
sweet
beer
to
follow
with
the
first
sip
alcohol
is
abundant
in
the
aroma
especially
early
on
the
flavor
nearly
three
years
in
is
very
nice
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overly
so
dark
caramel
and
baked
apples
before
the
taste
twists
nicely
and
plenty
early
into
wellhopped
finish
pepper
and
again
some
leather
add
interest
midway
along
with
a
cognac
and
golden
raisins
perhaps
unfortunately
the
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
ton
of
sediments
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
making
this
beer
which
seems
otherwise
perfect
for
savoring
on
the
tongue
hard
to
drink
in
that
way
the
alcohol
is
predominant
which
is
understandable
for
12
abv
i
came
to
this
beer
with
high
hopes
and
im
not
disappointed
it
loses
a
few
points
on
the
palate
im
not
big
on
beer
with
heavy
sediments
floating
around
it
was
an
interesting
experience
now
that
ive
had
two
de
dolle
beers
seems
like
their
beers
have
a
tendency
to
bang
out
big
foamy
heads
and
complex
flavors
worth
deliberating
over
pours
a
nice
slightly
amber
gold
with
thick
white
head
decent
lacing
left
most
of
the
yeast
in
bottom
of
bottle
to
try
later
flavour
is
of
yeast
slight
hops
sweet
malt
banana
sugar
and
some
fruity
esters
flavor
matches
well
but
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
but
obviously
still
there
pretty
decent
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
lots
of
little
floaties
swirling
around
just
beautiful
tastes
of
sweet
candi
sugars
with
a
hint
of
fruits
like
apple
and
pear
i
think
this
bottle
is
lying
when
it
says
its
12
alc
that
is
ridiculous
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
am
detecting
no
hotness
at
all
to
this
very
tasty
treat
rock
on
de
dolle
d
overall
way
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
although
this
one
isnt
hot
in
the
traditional
sense
the
ethanol
taste
is
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
would
love
to
try
one
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
to
see
if
it
mellows
out
but
as
is
decent
but
a
bit
underwhelming
pours
a
hazy
dark
amberish
golden
with
an
initial
solid
white
head
which
fades
to
bubbles
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
dried
fruit
skins
grapes
plums
honey
sweetness
bready
yeast
malty
spice
and
a
faint
woody
essence
some
alcohol
heat
is
present
too
taste
is
boozy
dark
fruits
carmel
brown
sugar
with
a
yeasty
mild
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
and
rich
overall
a
sipper
for
a
cool
winter
night
drinks
slowly
yet
well
a
huge
beer
but
with
enough
flavor
and
nuances
that
you
want
to
sip
and
savor
for
a
while
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
with
for
an
extended
period
to
best
take
in
all
it
has
to
offer
at
12
abv
its
going
to
be
a
sipper
anyway
one
and
done
but
really
what
isnt
at
an
abv
that
high
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
massive
alcohol
kick
but
the
flavours
are
anything
but
uninteresting
me
likes
a
lot
d
drinkable
but
not
too
at
the
abv
level
this
is
an
epic
beer
i
have
seen
it
on
the
shelf
for
years
now
i
am
glad
i
bought
it
finally
its
vigorous
quirks
and
steamroller
strength
are
exactly
what
make
the
beer
so
deserving
of
its
notoriety
as
a
classic
christmas
time
tipple
its
savory
spiciness
and
warming
qualities
are
perfectly
suited
to
the
festivities
of
the
holidays
and
stashing
a
few
of
these
in
the
cellar
for
future
christmases
is
indeed
a
wonderful
gift
to
give
yourself
drinkability
alone
one
maybe
two
is
plenty
after
all
it
is
12
its
a
beer
i
have
in
my
christmas
line
up
each
year
and
one
i
look
forward
to
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
good
its
diverse
id
say
medium
to
full
bodied
even
though
its
unfiltered
ti
doesnt
leave
that
yeasty
feeling
in
your
mouth
that
bad
that
many
of
this
style
do
this
beer
is
technically
a
winter
style
but
could
really
be
used
as
a
year
round
beverage
in
my
opinion
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
absolutely
wonderful
d
of
the
many
different
brews
there
is
for
the
winter
season
i
like
this
one
in
the
belgian
strong
dark
ale
for
an
all
around
everyday
brew
this
might
be
one
i
would
get
for
a
good
goto
strong
ale
its
a
slow
sipper
and
one
is
enough
there
is
way
too
much
going
on
to
enjoy
several
this
is
a
big
beer
the
flavor
is
intense
and
spicy
and
the
alcohol
is
high
a
beer
to
be
reserved
for
special
occasions
a
very
nice
and
fulfilling
beer
perfect
after
dinner
with
the
cheese
2008
vintage
wow
the
mad
brewers
do
know
how
to
make
some
great
beers
the
yeast
is
the
star
of
the
show
as
most
belgian
beers
are
and
it
does
not
dissapoint
the
12
alcohol
is
well
balanced
in
this
beer
meaning
you
feel
its
presence
but
it
is
not
in
your
face
reallly
excellent
well
crafted
brew
enjoy
to
make
matters
worse
the
mouthfeel
is
characterized
by
a
flat
and
syrupy
thick
liquid
thats
it
life
is
too
short
to
drink
bad
beer
like
this
and
even
shorter
to
write
about
them
an
utter
abomination
when
i
type
stille
nacht
into
google
it
asks
me
if
i
meant
still
nacho
i
wish
i
did
even
stillborn
nachos
would
be
better
than
this
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
the
right
amount
of
booze
showing
it
had
some
solid
sweet
flavors
but
still
had
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
even
things
out
the
cereal
grain
worked
well
with
this
beer
i
dig
it
decent
drinkability
bottle
cap
says
2003
assume
that
is
the
year
this
was
bottled
pours
a
cloudy
hazed
apricot
orangebrown
color
with
very
minimal
head
what
head
there
is
collars
around
the
glass
in
an
off
white
color
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
apricot
and
pear
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
as
well
with
an
undertone
of
alcohol
apricot
flavors
is
all
i
have
in
my
mind
in
a
god
way
as
this
drinks
very
smooth
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
white
grapes
in
the
taste
as
well
some
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
this
down
this
is
very
good
sweet
but
good
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
tulip
glass
and
it
had
a
two
finger
fluffy
head
it
tasted
mediumbodied
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
the
aroma
smells
somewhat
fruity
it
is
very
smooth
to
the
taste
i
hope
to
visit
the
de
dolle
brewery
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
overall
a
truly
decadent
beer
that
makes
for
a
great
dessert
or
nightcap
this
is
among
the
better
bsdas
ive
had
definitely
worth
hunting
down
or
picking
up
if
spotted
pours
a
glowing
candy
apple
orange
with
a
thin
white
film
atop
nose
is
really
signature
de
dolle
yeast
apples
tropical
fruit
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
flavor
is
a
myriad
of
things
some
tripel
elements
but
so
much
more
segues
from
an
apple
tropical
fruit
into
a
lavish
lightly
sour
almost
winey
finish
this
bottle
has
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
on
the
back
palate
the
best
vintages
are
sweet
and
candylike
but
finish
dry
and
have
a
kind
of
sour
funk
to
them
its
a
magical
beer
probably
best
to
let
it
age
for
a
couple
years
ppours
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
fits
the
style
quite
well
with
good
notes
of
dark
fruits
caramel
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
combine
together
quite
well
there
is
a
nice
creamy
character
that
accentuates
the
dark
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
overall
a
well
done
beer
that
i
think
would
be
quite
a
bit
better
with
some
age
on
it
overall
impression
delicious
reminiscent
of
alcoholic
cider
drinkability
bought
this
on
sale
at
my
local
bottle
shop
and
it
appears
that
soon
ill
be
back
to
purchase
more
i
can
imagine
this
being
quite
boozy
fresh
but
after
a
year
its
drinking
rather
well
after
a
few
more
years
i
bet
this
will
drink
like
a
champ
phenomenal
d
its
too
bad
that
this
beer
was
so
alcohol
forward
ill
look
to
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
possibly
with
an
aged
bottle
hoping
this
was
an
aberration
d
i
shared
this
beer
with
a
friend
and
was
left
wanting
more
i
could
have
easily
had
the
whole
thing
2
may
have
been
to
much
this
is
a
perfect
sipping
beer
for
a
cool
night
or
a
night
cap
although
being
a
2003
vintage
its
going
to
be
a
rare
and
special
night
a
must
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
i
was
surprised
that
the
color
of
this
beer
was
not
dark
at
all
but
rather
a
hazy
golden
sunset
hue
the
beer
has
a
mediumsmall
white
head
that
recedes
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
consist
of
belgian
yeast
alcohol
and
delectable
fruity
esters
stille
nacht
has
a
very
bold
and
brash
flavor
with
a
heavy
alcohol
presence
i
would
really
like
to
sample
some
older
vintages
as
i
imagine
this
beer
ages
quite
gracefully
despite
the
deceptive
appearance
this
beer
tastes
remarkably
like
a
quad
the
feel
is
very
good
and
the
heat
is
even
enjoyable
this
spicy
beer
was
a
tasty
treat
i
look
forward
to
stashing
a
few
of
these
away
in
the
cellar
d
an
excellent
drinkable
beer
overall
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
de
dolle
the
alcohol
burn
makes
it
a
little
tougher
to
drink
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
sipper
to
help
warm
you
up
in
the
winter
the
palate
also
delivered
on
this
one
which
cannot
be
said
for
their
other
offering
so
the
alcohol
burn
was
kept
in
check
by
the
creaminess
of
the
body
check
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
i
feel
privileged
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
such
an
amazing
beer
kudos
to
the
brewers
at
de
dolle
for
making
such
a
fantastic
elixir
and
to
the
folks
at
erasmus
for
presenting
this
beer
to
me
in
optimal
condition
i
simply
cannot
have
imagined
a
better
way
to
finish
my
meal
drinking
this
was
surely
the
highlight
of
my
belgian
beer
odyssey
notes
lets
give
credit
to
de
dolle
this
brewery
makes
real
quality
beers
ive
yet
to
be
disapointed
d
very
very
easy
to
drink
more
than
1
11
3
330ml
bottle
grabbed
a
marked
down
bottle
of
this
at
downtown
wine
and
spirits
today
i
like
the
label
with
the
little
snowman
on
it
it
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
color
with
a
solid
inch
of
white
heading
alcohol
can
be
smelled
right
off
the
bat
after
the
pour
along
with
some
honey
and
ripe
dark
fruit
more
of
the
same
from
the
taste
which
is
very
nectar
like
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
is
definitely
on
the
hefty
side
and
rather
hot
though
i
am
not
sure
what
year
this
bottle
is
the
heightened
alcohol
does
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
if
you
sip
this
one
slowly
your
good
to
go
overall
a
nice
belgian
beer
from
de
dolle
i
will
visit
this
ale
again
when
it
gets
a
bit
colder
out
cheers
d
most
excellent
indeed
i
would
buy
this
4
5
nice
carbonation
for
such
a
heady
brew
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
mead
and
madiera
with
some
orange
somehow
i
dont
smell
a
lot
of
boose
even
with
it
being
12
the
taste
is
very
madeiralike
more
than
anything
else
which
is
right
up
my
alley
taking
my
first
few
sips
i
guessed
the
alcohol
content
was
maybe
around
89
10
at
the
most
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
12
the
taste
of
the
boose
is
there
but
its
extremely
well
balanced
against
the
hops
and
the
malt
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
for
how
strong
it
is
i
know
i
should
sip
it
carefully
with
my
pinky
stuck
out
but
i
cant
help
but
take
one
big
sip
after
another
this
is
truly
a
magical
beer
even
by
de
dolles
standards
no
way
it
could
be
anyones
everyday
beer
but
it
is
an
easy
sipping
beer
d
although
sweet
and
a
little
boozy
this
is
a
really
pleasant
sipper
especially
at
12
too
much
would
upset
my
stomach
though
d
i
am
into
it
for
sure
the
complexity
of
this
beer
will
keep
me
going
back
for
more
d
just
too
hard
for
me
to
drink
as
it
was
so
rich
need
something
to
cut
the
sweetness
and
depth
of
this
food
or
something
else
drinkability
exceptionally
drinkable
especially
considering
its
largerthanlife
abv
while
i
think
there
are
some
imperfections
in
the
flavor
its
still
very
good
and
has
a
helluva
lot
going
for
it
a
very
solid
beer
the
more
belgians
i
have
the
more
i
realize
that
there
arent
enough
categories
for
them
perhaps
that
is
the
point
really
loved
the
nose
on
this
taste
didnt
quite
meet
expectations
but
still
very
good
nonetheless
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
bsda
big
white
head
decent
lacing
smell
is
almost
sour
some
big
yeasty
notes
some
lemon
zest
a
hint
of
darker
fruit
some
clove
and
some
booze
taste
is
more
bsda
likeclove
banana
dark
fruit
yeast
and
unfortunately
a
lot
of
booze
medium
mouthfeel
not
as
big
as
i
would
like
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
phenolbooze
content
here
kind
of
slows
it
down
for
me
i
might
have
to
revisit
it
d
abv
blends
nicely
at
12
not
my
favourite
ale
from
the
mad
brewers
but
its
good
all
of
de
dolles
beers
are
big
belgians
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
in
terms
of
intensity
would
love
to
put
some
age
on
a
few
bottles
d
a
big
and
complex
bsda
run
a
tad
a
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
is
a
holiday
beer
so
compliments
the
season
well
with
it
big
abv
and
spicy
flavors
think
ill
buy
a
couple
of
these
to
age
seems
like
the
potential
for
even
greater
complexity
is
very
good
drinkability
pretty
solid
with
the
intensity
of
a
strong
sweet
brew
its
definitely
a
slowsipper
for
me
and
the
small
singular
bottle
is
more
than
plenty
overall
this
is
a
great
belgain
brew
sweet
and
malty
with
light
fruits
this
is
my
second
time
trying
this
and
ive
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
both
times
really
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
age
in
the
cellar
worth
seeking
out
d
both
bottles
are
gone
out
this
but
damn
a
great
beer
with
this
much
age
on
it
this
beer
has
certainly
become
very
elegant
over
the
years
and
the
12
are
well
hidden
the
45
dkk
4
we
paid
were
money
very
well

this
is
truly
a
five
star
beer
try
this
beer
a
delight
this
my
second
review
was
considerably
different
than
the
first
which
consisted
of
much
more
carbonation
and
sharper
acetic
and
citric
tones
that
were
good
but
not
nearly
as
representative
of
the
delicate
richness
otherwise
found
in
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
my
first
review
didnt
seem
to
suggest
much
of
the
same
beer
found
in
other
reviews
i
sense
that
the
flavors
and
aromas
described
in
this
review
are
more
consistent
with
its
usual
character
a
phenomenal
beer
with
a
lot
of
incredible
balance
and
craft
presenting
in
a
blend
that
ages
remarkably
well
ive
tasted
it
over
10
years

please
brink
back
the
old
stille

one
of
the
beers
i
would
have
rated
a
complete
5
this
beer
smelled
wonderful
and
it
may
have
been
the
most
wonderful
part
the
appearance
of
the
beer
looked
like
hard
cider
and
it
also
had
a
cider
taste
mixed
with
a
belgian
strong
dark
there
was
hint
of
orange
peel
and
spice
the
carbonation
seemed
strong
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
were
complex
overall
the
beer
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
this
definitely
a
unique
beer
this
beer
pours
with
a
huge
head
it
is
about
the
color
of
murky
water
the
smell
is
alcohol
and
bannannas
the
taste
is
fruity
and
sweet
mouthfeel
isstrong
this
beer
is
a
sipper
many
fruity
flavers
are
hidden
and
the
alcohol
is
clawing
to
escape
this
beer
attacks
your
tastebuds
very
good
beer
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
without
falling
over
but
a
fine
example
of
what
belgium
can
produce
poured
from
the
330ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
body
is
an
opaque
goldenorange
hue
topped
by
a
good
inch
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
retains
very
well
and
leaves
some
pretty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
herby
with
some
holiday
spice
lightly
sweet
malt
and
more
than
a
little
alcohol
the
herby
character
is
dominant
on
the
palate
especially
up
front
sweet
malt
emerges
to
balance
it
out
with
spicy
notes
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
touch
of
treacle
coming
through
right
before
the
swallow
body
is
rich
silky
and
creamy
very
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
for
a
strong
dark
ale
wish
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
bottle
this
holiday
season
praise
be
st
arnold
this
is
beer
at
its
finest
that
little
snowman
on
the
label
has
been
rightly
crowned
as
this
is
truly
a
regal
concoction
the
complexity
of
this
ale
is
the
closest
ive
come
to
witnessing
divine
inspiration
fine
madness
fantastic
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
belgian
ale
to
this
day
frickin
delicious
nice
sipping
brew
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
that
2002
on
tap
if
youre
anywhere
near
delaneys
in
new
haven
then
you
have
to
try
it
this
one
is
decent
drinkability
im
lucky
it
comes
in
a
small
bottle
but
even
this
is
a
challenge
to
finish
drinkabilityoverall
interesting
for
sure
just
soooo
sweet
that
its
hard
to
get
over
not
necessarily
cloying
but
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
glad
to
be
splitting
the
bottle
with
steve
hmmmm
mouthfeel
was
fast
and
delicious
came
off
as
quite
drinkable
with
a
ninjalike
hidden
abv
pours
a
very
hazy
amber
with
a
good
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
sour
and
smells
slightly
of
grape
must
and
pommace
with
banana
and
sweeter
smells
emerging
on
the
finish
taste
is
of
juicy
fruit
cherries
cinammon
tangy
malt
and
some
late
astringency
nice
balanced
mouthfeel
and
interesting
enough
for
very
good
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
hot
smooth
and
full
bodied
im
impressed
that
they
were
able
to
get
a
beer
to
taste
like
this
more
please
this
was
poured
into
a
wide
mouthed
goblet
the
color
is
a
hazy
goldenorange
the
head
is
big
but
it
dissipates
quickly
to
leave
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
honey
figs
a
little
citrus
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
malty
sugary
honey
sweet
the
honey
dominates
the
flavor
the
mouth
is
coated
by
the

that
is

good
find

like
dark
fruit
the
sweetness
hits
right
away
its
a
bit
overpowering
slight
caramel
malt
taste
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
going
down
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
light
carbonation
a
very
sweet
beer
something
to
sip
i
would
only
drink
one
cant
imagine
drinking
2
of
these
in
a
row
overall
a
good
ale
but
i
need
to
go
brush
my
teeth
now
a
very
sweet
beer
for
dessert
only
i
cant
get
into
this
style
personally
though
overall
a
fine
belgian
normally
i
dont
care
for
sugary
sweetness
and
alcohol
but
it
is
well
blended
and
balanced
here
big
and
chewy
my
understanding
is
that
this
is
at
least
a
partially
wild
beer
i
detect
some
wildness
in
the
aroma
but
i
suspect
that
this
is
a
bit
underattenuated
by
the
nearly
cloying
sweetness
definitely
drinkable
but
could
be
a
bit
drier
i
suspect
this
beer
becomes
something
mighty
special
after
510
years
of
aging
great
beer
complex
intersting
new
flavors
everytime
you
sip
holloah
drinkability
i
was
given
one
as
a
present
and
i
cant
say
im
eager
to
get
more
this
beer
was
sweet
and
loaded
with
an
alcohol
presence
that
seemed
to
make
it
not
much
more
than
a
sweet
sipping
beer
from
belgium
im
a
big
lover
of
belgians
and
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
ive
had
bettermore
balanced
beers
belgian
strong
dark
ales
are
fast
becoming
my
favorite
style
because
of
their
complexity
every
new
brewer
and
bottle
is
a
surprise
this
beer
is
a
must
try
will
be
over
the
top
for
some
but
it
might
be
your
next
favorite
2005
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
thin
white
head
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
carbonation
in
this
one
there
also
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
in
there
too
the
sediment
never
settles
it
just
hangs
around
floating
in
the
beer
the
aroma
is
initially
sweet
but
a
tinge
of
alcohol
comes
through
sweet
breads
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
full
of
malt
sweetness
some
bready
yeast
flavors
nice
spices
and
a
little
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
clings
to
your
palate
well
but
does
not
overpower
excellent
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
this
one
goes
down
like
milk
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
that
of
guinness
draught
pretty
easy
drinking
i
would
say
this
is
middle
of
the
road
for
strength
8
but
it
never
really
shows
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
an
attractive
honey
orange
beer
capped
by
an
off
white
foamy
head
this
is
an
aromatic
beer
it
fills
the
air
as
its
poured
this
smells
like
belgium
yeasty
spicy
with
orange
bread
with
some
sweet
fruity
malt
the
beer
takes
you
totally
by
surprise
when
you
drink
it
though
this
is
pretty
big
lots
and
lots
of
malt
and
alcohol
but
smooth
warm
but
not
on
fire
you
start
off
with
the
yeast
and
the
malt
then
it
get
sweeter
and
finishes
with
spice
and
clove
although
not
really
clean
and
just
short
of
cloying
if
it
had
just
a
little
more
compexity
to
it
with
a
cleaner
finish
this
would
be
an
amazing
beer
but
it
falls
short
on
a
few
notes
on
the
whole
an
interesting
beer
with
a
bit
of
an
indentity
problem
finish
is
tart
and
mouth
puckering
quite
appetizing
for
the
next
sip
and
hence
very
drinkable
to
me
drinkability
is
kind
of
not
right
its
an
amazingly
complex
beer
with
lots
of
flavors
but
a
full
glass
is
a
lot
to
take
its
a
sipper
not
a
drinker
d
bit
too
sweet
for
me
this
was
over
the
top
sweet
probably
could
use
a
couple
of
years
to
round
out
drinkability
is
ok
not
bad
to
start
the
longer
you
sip
the
more
the
alcohol
seems
to
grow
in
intensity
thanks
to
babydoc
and
bcg
bif
for
this
bottle
drinkability
it
is
not
drinkable
the
sweetness
and
abv
overwhelm
peachy
colour
with
foamy

and

of

if
you
like

overall
an

beer
highly
recommended
i
have
another
of
these
which
ill
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
what
difference
it
makes
d
a
very
interesting
beer
from
a
brilliant
brewery
it
took
a
few
sips
to
get
into
because
of
the
initial
sweetness
but
was
well
worth
it
unfortunately
this
beer
is
better
than
its
rating
reflects
i
will
gladly
start
my
night
off
in
any
season
with
this
brew
despite
the
silly
snowman
on
the
label
d
awesome
i
wish
this
was
year
round
and
i
could
get
it
more
easily
as
it
is
ill
be
very
sad
when
the
last
bottle
sells
of
my
shelf
which
will
be
very
very
soon
great
great
beer
from
a
great
great
brewery
rock
this
beer
poured
a
deep
cloudy
amber
color
with
absolutely
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
i
first
get
is
very
earthy
and
a
bit
sweet
maybe
plumy
the
taste
is
very
interesting
i
get
an
initial
shot
of
tartness
and
after
it
lingers
some
sweetness
almost
port
like
again
i
get
some
plum
notes
like
in
the
aroma
very
nice
i
compare
the
taste
somewhat
to
the
taste
i
recently
got
in
an
88
bottle
of
jw
lees
harvest
ale
overall
an
intersting
beer
that
was
worth
the
try
drinkability
was
decent
but
holy
hell
was
this
a
strong
beer
id
say
this
was
a
definite
sipping
beer
but
even
this
doesnt
warrant
several
in
an
evening
you
enjoy
one
or
two
of
these
tops
overall
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
overall
this
is
one
sweet
sweet
beer
theres
some
complexity
there
but
in
the
end
its
just
too
much
sweetness
and
syrupiness
in
one
place
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
honey
with
alot
of
floaties
and
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
a
thin
layer
of
lacing
aroma
strong
hops
followed
by
lemon
and
and
malts
with
a
nice
sugar
sweetness
and
a
sweet
navel
orange
flavor
the
sweetness
was
like
cotton
candy
than
the
hops
and
malts
came
out
nicely
followed
by
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
along
with
some
spices
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
enjoyed
drinking
this
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
little
too
alcoholic
for
me
after
this
bottle
i
had
a
little
buzz
in
my
head
but
for
its
strength
it
is
very
balanced
excellent
a
strong
sipping
beer
flavor
profile
is
unusual
and
very
deftly
handled
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
very
enjoyable
after
last
years
fiasco
i
was
a
bit
scared
to
pick
this
bottle
up
this
is
my
celebration
beer
for
the
seattle
seahawks
winning
the
nfc
championship
game
pours
a
hazy
caramel
colored
brown
with
an
offwhite
eighth
inch
head
in
a
chalice
head
drops
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
quickly
aroma
is
fruity
winelike
and
a
touch
yeasty
some
medicinal
aromas
as
well
first
taste
is
bursting
with
flavors
corriander
and
a
little
pepper
grapes
apricots
some
apples
and
significant
alcohol
warming
very
vinous
spicy
and
yeasty
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
a
creamy
roll
over
your
tongue
swallows
smoothly
this
is
a
slow
sipper
every
swallow
reminds
you
of
just
how
much
alcohol
is
in
this
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
the
burn
is
nice
but
dont
expect
this
to
disappear
in
a
matter
of
minutes
overall
this
is
a
tasty
belgian
with
nice
fruity
and
spicy
characteristics
to
help
bring
in
the
holidays
all
in
all
one
of
the
most
dynamic
beers
ive
ever
tasted
ive
never
had
something
taste
look
and
smell
almost
completely
diferrent
aside
from
looking
pretty
bad
this
beer
is
great
i
think
as
are
most
of
de
dolles
offerings
think
white
beer
on
steroids
i
think
thats
pretty
close
the
mouth
is
a
little
too
slick
for
my
likeing
the
wonderful
nose
and
complex
flavors
make
me
like
this
beer
yes
ill
have
another
11
6
oz
bottle
vintage
2004
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
muddy
coppery
orange
a
finger
of
off
white
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
some
slight
phenols
sweet
unripe
dark
fruit
some
yeast
and
a
slight
spiciness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
very
sweet
alcohol
infused
malt
molasses
dark
fruits
like
raisins
plums
figs
overripe
citrusvery
sweet
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
spicy
yeast
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
syrupy
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
dark
ale
that
is
overly
sweet
and
not
one
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
drinkability
a
rich
and
complex
brew
one
that
should
ultimately
be
savored
and
consumed
slowly
also
a
great
example
of
the
style
ill
surely
be
having
this
again
and
if
you
dont
think
you
can
handle
a
whole
bottle
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
6
ounces
a
piece
for
a
couple
of
folks
let
me
preface
this
by
saying
that
i
am
reviewing
a
3
yr
aged
bottle
in
particular
in
general
ive
always
regarded
stille
nacht
as
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
beer
but
never
one
of
my
favorites
this
weekend
my
friend
broke
out
a
bottle
that
he
had
aged
in
his
cellar
for
3
yrs
it
did
get
much
better
with
age
it
was
noticeably
sweeter
then
usual
im
not
usualy
a
fan
of
beer
that
is
too
sweet
but
with
the
probable
increase
in
alcohol
this
had
a
nice
mellow
blend
i
recomend
it
for
aging
if
thats
your
thing
notes
this
beer
is
like
a
barrage
of
different
flavors
one
coming
right
after
another
and
very
quickly
it
is
quite
a
potent
beer
in
terms
of
the
belgian
taste
and
the
alcohol
its
not
quite
as
restrained
and
balanced
as
other
belgian
strong
dark
ales
though
the
alcohol
taste
is
strong
its
never
hot
or
solventy
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
which
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
you
thinking
on
how
they
made
something
like
this
and
yearn
for
more
thanks
kevin
this
is
a
really
unique
brewery
ive
been
discovering
though
ive
only
had
a
few
of
their
beers
pours
a
light
but
rusty
looking
straw
color
nice
clarity
with
a
big
ol
fluffy
head
dont
know
if
id
call
this
a
strong
dark
all
because
its
not
exactly
that
dark
more
like
a
triple
or
a
strong
pale
or
something
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
maybe
even
some
candied
sugar
along
with
a
nice
peppery
spicy
hop
profile
the
taste
is
even
sweeter
almost
too
sweet
tastes
like
liquid
frosting
almost
yet
with
enough
herbal
spicy
hops
and
other
spices
to
balance
it
out
a
little
really
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
beer
from
being
just
that
much
better
and
more
drinkable
is
that
its
so
sweet
its
a
nice
quiality
at
first
but
its
almost
cloying
at
times
easy
enough
to
get
past
though
because
this
beer
has
so
much
else
going
on
definately
worth
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
and
yummy
alcohol
is
no
where
to
be
seen
i
love
this
beer
drinkability
is
as
good
as
can
be
for
this
type
of
beer
sweetness
wears
out
its
welcome
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
cant
imagine
having
more
than
one
but
its
a
very
well
put
together
belgian
brew
the
mecinal
qualities
are
there
in
the
taste
as
well
in
fact
sometimes
it
tastes
like
pepto
bismol
but
are
completely
obliterated
by
the
most
horribly
cloying
sweetness
you
can
possibly
imagine
besides
the
nice
apricot
flavors
this
tastes
like
bubble
yum
coated
with
pure
sugar
there
are
some
caramel
notes
in
the
finish
but
absolutely
nothing
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
which
lingers
on
an
on
the
only
time
this
beer
was
enjoyable
was
on
the
first
sip
before
the
lingering
sweetness
ill
give
it
a
2
0
bonus
points
for
complexity
but
even
that
seems
generous
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
and
well
carbonated
but
a
little
sticky
seeming
i
was
only
able
to
finish
a
quarter
of
this
in
almost
an
hour
wow
what
a
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
bottle
of
1982
when
i
was
at
the
kulminator
in
belgium
but
this
is
a
more
recent
example
and
is
simply
amazing
as
well
very
deceiving
in
that
it
looks
and
almost
tastes
like
it
might
have
gone
bad
but
the
complexity
of
the
fruit
flavors
and
malts
are
breathtaking
a
sipping
beer
that
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
finest
port
wine
mouthfeeldrinkability
wonderfully
viscous
the
texture
accentuates
the
bold
fruity
elements
of
the
beer
perfectly
this
might
be
saved
for
an
afterdinner
dessert
beer
as
this
could
pair
beautifully
with
vanilla
ice
cream
or
even
custard
very
nice
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
one
a
night
would
be
it
for
me
a
nice
once
a
year
treat
this
is
another
great
belgian
beer
brewed
as
only
the
belgians
can
do
it
always
interesting
to
read
the
old
reviews
i
clearly
needed
time
to
adjust
to
bigger
beers
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
and
i
usually
grab
it
when
i
see
it
which
isnt
that
often
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
ive
ever
had
great
body
full
lasting
foamy
head
maybe
the
sample
i
first
reviewed
was
a
bad
one
it
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
interesting
spices
nice
warming
effect
abv
well
disguised
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
poured
a
hazy
golden
with
a
deep
orange
hue
with
a
thinner
than
expected
head
that
left
no
lace
behindnice
aromas
of
tart
green
apple
and

yeast
and
belgian
candied

big
and
in
your
face
flavors
very

and
that
green

with
a

finish
glad
it
is
only
11
6
ozes
here
quite
heavy
but
packed
with
rich
flavorsa
sipper
for
sure
cheers
a
complex
offering
worthy
of
much
praise
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
again
and
again
pours
golden
hazy
floaties
all
around
absolute
minimal
head
smells
of
oranges
apples
cotton
candy
bubble
gum
and
very
very
sweet
tastes
very
very
sweet
cloying
fruits
and
honey
some
yeasty
bite
with
sharp
alcohols
all
over
the
finish
and
thank
god
for
it
cause
its
the
only
way
i
can
handle
this
sweetness
at
all
very
full
mouthfeel
with
very
little
carbonation
terrible
drinkability
due
to
its
syrupy
sweet
nature
dry
this
out
some
lighten
the
body
and
a
touch
more
carbonation
and
this
would
be
a
fantastic
triple
as
is
just
way
too
sweet
the
only
reason
i
keep
sipping
is
because
the
finish
with
the
alcohol
kick
and
warming
is
fairly
nice
this
will
not
be
a
repeat
purchase
body
is
a
beefy
medium
with
a
slick
sugary
and
coating
mouthfeel
with
a
slippery
texture
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
the
booze
and
the
sweetness
goes
great
with
the
jerk
pinapple
tilapia
i
had
for
dinner
what
a
cool
name
the
nose
is
full
of
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
it
pours
a
murky

with
a
foamy
white
cap

and
a
bit
sticky
from
the
residual
sugar
lightish
body
and
generous
carbonation
this
is
one
that
would
likely
gain
a
lot
from
prolonged
time
in
the
cellar
but
still
an
experience
as
is
drank
this
on
a
hot
august
evening
but
this
was
xmas
in
the
summer
showed
dark
orange
red
brown
with
a
misty
haze
the
nose
was
all
old
and
orange
peels
drowned
in
vats
of
fino
sherry
i
tasted
a
lot
of
huge
complexity
mixed
with
care
and
attention
to
the
little
beer
details
no
rough
edges
and
no
taste
holes
to
drive
the
truck
of
disapointment
through
a
beer
that
really
took
my
breath
away
and
replaced
with
brewers
cobwebs
and
grain
mice
hard
pour
yields
a
minimal
head
with
small
bubbles
color
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
brown
head
is
now
gone
as
i
type
this
typical
belgian
aroma
light
fruit
taste
is
very
intense
not
what
i
expected
from
the
light
aroma
and
color
bold
overripe
fruit
apricots
sweet
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
carbonation
is
detected
in
the
mouth
feel
but
almost
zero
head
interesting
taste
permeates
every
square
inch
of
my
mouth
strangely
i
perceive
a
great
deal
of
flavor
in
the
upper
back
of
my
mouth
intense
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bold
flavorful
belgian
with
a
full
body
then
this
is
it
seems
like
a
great
choice
if
you
are
going
to
have
one
beer
one
of
these
will
leave
you
satisfied
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
beer
when
i
find
it
again
even
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
could
be
happy
splitting
the
11
6oz
bottle
it
is
almost
too
much
maybe
there
is
a
purpose
for
the
anchor
old
foghorn
7
oz
bottles
another
very
nice
entry
from
the
best
belgian
brewery
no
ones
ever
heard
of
im
glad
i
bought
three
bottless
the
other
two
will
be
a
lot
better
a
year
from
now
one
of
best
beers
brewed
on
earth
and
also
one
of
the
toughest
to
acquire
this
belgian
beauty
has
dark
creamy
coloring
rich
with
chocolate
tones
the
taste
is
dense
with
sweet
bitter
truffles
and
spicy
apple
a
tad
tart
to
the
palate
but
the
sweetness
quickly
overtakes
your
senses
if
you
can
find
it
grab
it
this
one
is
true
brewing
perfection
drinkability
very
warming
but
i
think
one
is
perfect
for
an
evening
must
find
more
drinkability
an
excellent
nightcap
brew
maybe
even
with
a
dessert
with
tropical
fruits
in
it
or
maybe
pair
it
with
a
chocolate
dish
either
way
it
goes
down
smooth
and
really
warms
you
up
inside
a
dollop
of
sandy
head
the
bubbles
varying
dramatically
in
size
sits
atop
burnt
sienna
liquid
with
teacolored
highlights
and
dries
into
thick
arches
of
lace
miniscule
silvery
lines
of
carbonation
run
past
dense
blobs
of
suspended
sediment
one
swirl
of
the
goblet
and
the
whole
room
starts
reeking
of
cinnamon
graham
crackers
smells
like
wow
malt
malt
malt
caramel
covered
raisins
or
baked
apples
sprinkled
with
cocoa
powder
molasses
and
sawdust
with
a
cidery
wassail
finish
taste
is
all
huge
enormous
molasses
and
cinnamon
first
savory
and
gingery
shifting
to
caramel
apple
before
finishing
like
pear
syrup
and
clove
astonishing
mouthfeel
is
literally
cookieish
like
gingerbread
batter
with
a
floury
dryness
from
the
alcohol
some
drinkers
might
have
a
problem
with
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
but
im
having
mine
on
a
cold
spring
night
just
before
bedtime
and
under
the
circumstances
its
all
candy
wassail
scrumptiousness
and
scrumptiousity
yum
definitely
likes
up
to
its
name
a
strong
ale
pours
an
orange
hazy
brown
with
a
little
head
smell
is
like
a
cider
mixed
with
other
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
really
strong
at
first
but
as
the
sips
go
on
it
gets
more
manageable
the
initial
is
of
strong
cider
like
the
smell
the
middle
is
not
as
good
at
hiding
the
alcohol
and
tastes
like
that
the
taste
is
a
bitter
mixture
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
overall
it
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
is
not
able
to
hide
the
high
alcohol
overall
not
something
im
going
to
rush
back
to
again
soon
appearance
was
fine
but
the
overwhelming
sugary
character
and
alcohol
punch
didnt
do
anything
for
me
ive
been
saving
this
for
a
while
to
try
it
pours
a
dirty
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
its
almost
doughy
dank
musty
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
nose
would
say
some
nice
raisiney
sweetness
and
slight
bready
notes
there
is
a
slight
spiceyness
on
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
im
happy
i
didnt
let
the
nose
get
me
down
too
far
the
feel
is
full
and
thick
slightly
syrupy
overall
when
you
get
away
from
the
nose
this
one
really
is
a
nice
brew
the
sweetness
is
slightly
cloying
but
i
enjoy
it
this
forest
of
flavors
sits
upon
a
foamy
frothy
yet
syrupy
mouthfeel
somewhat
reminiscent
of
an
intense
california
orange
muscat
or
a
beerenauslese
the
nose
collects
a
sweet
malt
and
mashed
fruit
sour
with
light
peachapricot
floral
the
mouth
is
full
and
occupies
one
with
slight
syrup
the
palate
is
touched
by
the
low
tones
that
rise
up
first
the
sweet
malts
but
then
a
twang
hits
just
past
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
reaches
the
high
palate
and
remains
clear
into
the
next
taste
minutes
away
it
is
this
twang
that
i
found
took
energy
to
drink
and
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
stille
nacht
d
this
is
a
lovely
complex
beer
that
has
all
the
flavors
blending
together
in
a
wonderful
beer
it
may
be
one
of
the
few
redeeming
qualities
of
christmas
from
appearance
to
aroma
to
taste
to
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
treat
to
drink
very
sedimented
medium
brown
dull
and
sort
of
muddy
looking
thickish
head
settles
as
brown
grey
skim
of
18
of
an
inch
not
the
most
attractive
of
beers
laces
in
wide
loops
candied
fruit
aroma
sweet
like
the
bread
and
candies
of
hot
cross
buns
at
easter
full
mouthfeel
and
very
low
carbonation
would
come
off
as
lush
if
it
wasnt
for
prickly
cinnamon
and
alcohol
tones
lots
of
fruit
flavors
come
through
tempered
by
yeasty
flavors
and
an
awful
lot
of
residual
sugars
what
hits
me
especially
is
mincemeat
with
a
coallike
bittering
as
the
brew
rounds
out
while
not
my
favorite
as
a
pie
flavor
it
works
at
least
intellectually
in
the
brewers
art
the
flavor
profile
is
to
be
respected
here
in
my
opinion
comes
off
as
very
alcoholic
to
my
tastes
smooths
pleasantly
as
it
warms
up
but
still
for
me
gloppy
and
overly
sweet
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
can
see
in
moderation
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
mint
pine
raisins
hops
taste
is
freaking
weird
starts
of
insanely
sweet
then
rises
up
to
meet
the
hops
which
fade
to
leave
you
with
a
sweet
medicinal
flavor
very
fruity
with
many
over
the
top
flavors
with
strong
carmel
and
butter
flavors
slight
medicinal
quality
throughout
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sticky
holy
crap
this
beer
will
be
the
end
of
me
it
is
just
too
much
with
its
high
abv
boisterous
flavors
and
eccentric
belgian
artwork
this
is
a
really
special
treat
well
worth
a
try
my
least
favorite
belgian
thus
far
man
its
been
half
an
hour
since
i
finished
the
11
6
oz
and
my
review
and
im
still
drunk
dont
expect
to
drink
one
of
these
and
drive
stille
nacht
silent
night
is
a
fine
winter
warmer
of
a
bsda
with
a
full
flavored
sweet
fruitiness
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
christmas
fruitcake
aged
in
brandy
ive
been
impressed
by
de
dolle
even
though
ive
only
had
a
few
of
their
offerings
the
near
cloying
nature
of
this
beer
demands
that
it
be
drunk
slowly
but
its
a
journey
well
worth
taking
poured
with
little
carbonation
but
there
was
a
nice
slick
ot
white
head
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
quite
sweet
full
of
molassas
brown
sugar
carmalized
candi
sugar
and
very
sweet
belgian
notes
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sweet
getting
close
to
cloying
there
was
too
much
sweet
cherry
flavored
cough
syrup
and
not
enough
balance
even
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
would
help
this
was
vertainly
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
this
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
with
golden
hues
and
a
light
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
only
a
slight
lace
aromas
make
up
a
mix
of
yeasty
esters
along
with
white
grapes
and
an
appley
tone
initial
flavors
are
super
sweet
up
front
due
to
what
seems
to
be
a
heavy
dosage
of
belgian
candi
sugars
following
there
are
hints
ofapple
and
grape
like
tones
but
they
are
just
simply
overpowered
by
the
sugary
notes
the
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
is
slightly
gritty
and
slightly
effervesent
due
to
the
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
sweet
as
the
beginning
which
makes
it
quite
hard
to
put
down
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
strong
belgian
ale
but
one
that
i
can
definetly
do
without
on
the
walk
over
to
hampden
the
warmth
buoys
you
the
sticky
sugar
is
gone
and
your
mouth
isnt
warmed
but
your
body
is
your
face
is
red
your
cheeks
are
rosy
and
your
body
tingles
with
belgian
xmas
delight
what
a
refined
old
world
treasure
which
contrasts
sharply
to
kitschy
christmas
goodness
good
conversation
hub
cap
xmas
trees
creepy
moving
dolls
and
my
new
favorite
winter
warmer
i
cant
say
enough
positive
things
about
this
beer
ill
be
scoring
it
as
one
of
the
higher
ones
ive
reviewed
dont
think
of
me
as
a
5
whore
cheers
to
de
dolle
a
blend
of
fruit
cocktail
and
fine
old
pedro
ximenez
plus

2001
vintage
opened
with
a
loud
hiss
and
poured
into
the
goblet
a
chunky
golden
amber
with
a
volcano
of
light
beige
colored
rocky
foam
good
tattered
lacing
lots
of
particles
in
suspension
yeasty
spicy
aromas
with
a
solid
honey
malt
backbone
light
fruity
esters
way
more
fruity
in
the
taste
that
the
aroma
very
clover
honeylike
sweet
tropical
fruitiness
like
starfruit
muskmelon
and
guava
mild
esters
in
the
finish
is
the
only
letup
from
its
cloying
sweetness
overall
its
not
bad
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
recommend
trying
older
vintages
over
the
fresh
ones
it
pours
a
murky
amber
with
almost
no
head
it
looks
still
this
makes
the
bridge
between
an
english
barley
wine
and
a
belgian
christmas
ale
aroma
is
rather
complex
very
yeasty
and
sweet
but
also
full
of
fruity
esters
the
honeyish
malt
profile
is
extremely
fruity
peaches
apples
vinous
grapes
oranges
pears
aroma
is
also
quite
spicy
mint
cloves
and
alcoholic
a
little
less
would
have
been
appreciated
actually
as
at
times
you
feel
almost
like
youre
having
a
scotch
a
faint
bitterness
fails
from
balancing
the
almost
cloying
ravaging
sweetness
palate
is
yeasty
extremely
sweet
and
with
more
of
those
fruits
dancing
on
the
tongue
well
supported
by
a
medium
body
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
no
doubt
this
is
complex
and
fullflavoured
but
the
balance
is
just
lacking
when
its
so
sweet
and
a
bit
too
much
alcoholic
for
its
own
good
i
must
say
i
feel
a
bit
let
down
not
only
cause
i
love
de
dolle
but
also
because
there
are
plenty
of
things
going
on
in
this
beer
but
they
dont
seem
so
well
blended
while
it
has
a
fairly
good
reputation
unlike
other
reviews
this
poured
with
a
thick
creamy
head
with
remarkable
retention
it
has
a
deep
pumpkin
pie
color
and
despite
my
best
efforts
plenty
of
yeast
came
out
of
the
bottle
when
poured
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
soy
sauce
with
a
high
level
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
but
does
not
make
up
with
the
overly
sweet
taste
as
though
the
brewers
were
a
little
too
happy
with
their
belgium
candy
sugar
overall
having
to
take
extra
sips
of
this
beer
to
review
it
was
unpleasurable
the
rest
i
suffered
a
great
tragedy
and
went
down
my
sink
after
friends
rejected
my
offer
of
free
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
very
little
head
due
to
next
almost
no
carbonation
the
aroma
is
both
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
with
an
interesting
spicey
peppery
background
the
alcohol
grabs
your
tongue
first
and
then
there
is
a
quick
rush
of
a
licorice
taste
with
a
slight
spicey
peppery
hop
finish
because
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
but
i
would
not
try
to
sit
around
and
drink
several
of
these
dont
know
what
vintage
this
one
is
but
pours
with
zero
carbonation
into
a
goblet
none
nada
zip
so
that
affects
appearance
its
a
golden
dark
honeyorange
with
small
floaties
only
noticeable
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
smell
is
chewy
malt
and
hints
of
honey
the
taste
is
thick
and
sickeningly
salty
sweet
not
impressed
not
in
the
least
it
kind
of
tastes
like
thick
fruit
with
a
soy
sauce
without
the
salt
aftertaste
all
i
can
really
say
is
yucky

not
any

a

i
had
it
on
tap
it
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
lots
of
yeast
in
the
keg
i
guess
very
drinkable
but
you
have
to
like
sweet
malt
flavor
over
hops
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
year
round
not
just
at
christmas
time
note
so
sure
this
is
very
very
drinkable
but
not
bad
either
ive
really
been
finding
de
dolle
beers
fairly
harsh
recently
the
main
scent
reminds
me
of
some
shampoo
i
used
alll
throughout
highschool
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cant
remember
the
name
of
very
girly
and
very
fresh
scented
very
springy
still
cant
place
it

spices

bit

much

for
me
too

mouth
thankfully
the
chunks
that
are
shooting
around
in
there
are
not
something
you
can
feel
just
see
i
really
am
surprised
that
this
tastes
as
good
as
it
does
after
its
appearance
this
is
almost

the

yet
keeps
it
bitey
enjoyed
the
flavors
alot
but
with
the
amount
of
carbination
and
intensity
of
flavor
it
may
have
a
bit
too
much
going
on
to
be
more
than

i
could
not

sauce
the
front
comes
in
extremely
sweet
with
spice
and
overripe
fruit
it
smoothes
a
little
into
the
middle
taking
on
a
more
creamy
fruity
syrupy
character
spicy
fruit
in
the
finish
doesnt
quite
hide
the
big
alcohol
its
too
sugary
and
syrupy
for
me
but
there
are
some
nice
fruit
and
spice
flavors
in
there
1999
bottle
drank
in
2004
at
kulminator
in
antwerp
poured
a
hazy
medium
brown
beer
with
a
super
huge
head
with
perfect
retention
carbonation
is
perfect
with
bubbles
still
present
10
minutes
after
the
beer
was
poured
which
is
a
bit
surprising
considering
the
age
of
this
beer
aroma
is
a
quite
strong
mix
of
plums
sugars
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
in
my
lifetime
and
consisted
of
a
mix
of
roasted
and
sweet
malt
plums
and
a
sweet
bitter
finish
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
didnt
break
the
overall
perfect
balance
of
this
beer
i
know
must
find
more
of
this
since
it
is
so
incredible
notes
12
ounces
is
more
than
enough
you
may
want
to
share
this
bottle
and
be
sure
to
save
it
for
the
end
of
the
night
on
a
special
occasion
the
sweetness
may
be
overpowering
for
some
ive
been
saving
this
since
december
and
i
couldnt
wait
any
longer
i
should
have
waited
until
this
coming
december
as
this
fine
belgian
surely
would
keep
nicely
for
awhile
ill
revisit
this
again
poured
a
hazy
amber

foam
that
settled
flat
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
sweet
caramel
and
dried
fruit
figs

aroma
with
some
malt
the
taste
was
full
of
dried
fruit
flavors
with
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
some
sugar
and
a
vinous
grape
flavor
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
sweet
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
lingered
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
for
sipping
and
savoring

with
hardly
any

i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
though
many
will
find
the
sweetness
cloying
i
enjoyed
the
sweet

finish
and
would
happily
have

this
brew
is
a
dark

with
a
very
thick
offwhite

thick
and
sticky
lacing
complex
aroma
of
alcohol
sweet
fruit
vanilla
and

mediumbodied
and
borderline
cloying
at
times
but
with
a
satisfying
array
of
flavors
the
different
fruits
like
plum
and
apple
are
at
the
forefront
there
is
also
a
nice
malt
spice
and
alcohol
presence
the
finish
is
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
yeast
taking
your
time
with
this
one
is
the
way
to
go
a
very
nice
beer
was
on
sale
wanted
to
give
it
a
go
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
spicey
scent
there
are
a
number
of
ingredients
here
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
a
single
one
it
almost
has
a
rootbeer
smell
to
it
very
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
really
heavy
and
full
of
sweet
malts
and
spices
im
pretty
sure
corriander
is
used
here
along
with
ginger
and
some
others
it
warms
on
the
way
down
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
it
drinks
well
this
is
a
good
belgian
brew
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
and
deep
amber
color
with
a
frothy
bright
white
head
that
piles
high
upon
the
body
as
it

a
real
treat
for
the

start
is
moderately

perfectly

and
the

finish
is
timidly
acidic
the

dry
aftertaste
a
fine
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
immensely
in
one
word
wow
this
cloudy
dark
orange
beer
is
a
great
treat
the
fruity
aroma
smells
of
apple
and
plum
these
are
but
a
few
of
the
tastes
in
found
in
this
very
complex
brew
there
isnt
much
carbonation
and
for
that
matter
a
head
but
it
does
not
matter
it
is
spicy
in
the
finish
with
some
pepper
notes
and
a
burst
of
warming
alcohol
a
must
have
in
the
winter
time
medium
copper
body
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
of
tangy
fruit
thats
been
soaking
in
alcohol
overnight
slightly
vinuous
and
yeasty
taste
was
a
little
surprising
over
the
top
sweetness
laced
with
alcohol
or
more
accurately
cough
syrup
belgian
cough
syrup
whew
the
big
candy
sugaralcohol
wave
crashes
into
some
sharp
bitterness
but
the
nyquilness
lingers
on
the
combination
of
the
cloying
candy
sweetness
and
the
medicinal
alcohol
prove
too
much
for
me
to
enjoy
this
im
hoping
this
bottle
was
an
off
one
but
im
afraid
i
wont
be
ponying
up
another
5
to
find
out
taste
is
immaculately
displayed
with
great
easy
and
very
yummy
flavors
of
sweetish
dark
fruits
and
heavy
liquored
candies
yum
oh
my
this
is
nice
exceptional
thickness
its
got
a
great
heavy
creamyness
and
feel
thats
loaded
with
great
dark
caramel
and
toffee
candy
laced
with
intermingling
sweetened
and
ripe
dark
fruits
of
yellow
raisins
plum
dates
and
dulled
orange
notes
of
honey
dart
across
the
finish
along
with
slight
floral
herbalness
and
a
lingering
darkened
sweetness
resides
as
the
thickness
just
keeps
sticking
within
and
coating
every
pore
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
late
warmth
sneaks
up
into
the
nose
clearing
the
senses
a
bit
incredible
for
8
usually
that
amount
doesnt
offer
up
so
much
warming
attributes
but
this
stands
on
its
own
absolutely
yummy
and
thick
with
a
nice
added
oommff
of
warmth
ohh
so
nice
lovely
brew
recommended
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
pour
was
a
dark
cloudy
amber
head
which
settled
down
nicely
aroma
was
of
caramel
i
found
the
taste
to
be
of
candied
caramel
mouthfeel
was
rather
full
but
very
smooth
and
sweet
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
thought
it
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
good
but
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
this
brew
comes
off
more
like
juice
than
beer
with
a
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
a
monstrous
sweetness
this
would
be
a
terrific
albeit
expensive
beer
to
give
to
that
girl
you
know
that
only
likes
fruity
neon
colored
mixed
drinks
and
claims
that
beer
is
gross
not
that
its
unpalatable
for
a
connoisseur
but
its
an
accessible
flavor
for
the
uninitiated
the
8
price
tag
on
my
glass
will
definitely
prevent
another
round
but
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
another
anyways
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
and
the
last
few
sips
become
cumbersome
drinakability
is
very
high
but
can
only
imagine
what
a
few
of
these
would
do
my
brain
this
is
a
great
oneatatime
beer
not
quite
so
large
at
the
midas
touch
i
think
i
actually
prefer
this
one
to
that
beer
will
order
again
this
beer
has
a
nice
copper
colour
but
its
cloudy
from
the
yeast
the
head
dissapears
quickly
leaving
a
thin
white
hint
of
the
head
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
citrus
fruit
and
yeast
but
you
also
smell
the
alcohol
of
this
strong
beer
it
has
a
sweet
taste
almost
to
sweet
for
me
you
can
taste
the
yeast
too
the
alcohol
leaves
a
warm
feeling
and
it
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
silent
night
when
it
is
cold
outside
nice
bright
copper
color
with
a
suspension
of
particles
hanging
evenly
dispersed
throughout
no
head
whatsoever
only
a
slight
thin
bubbly
lace
on
the
surface
and
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
vinous
notes
no
real
hops
apparent
on
the
nose
very
full
and
thick

even
syrupy

mouthfeel
the
palate
is
at
once
very
sweet
smooth
malty
start
with
very
light
carbonation
that
comes
in
towards
the
middle
towards
the
end
theres
a
slight
tartness
that
develops
but
the
sweetness
never
fades
the
finish
is
quite
warming
there
are
some
ever
so
slight
vinous
notes
that
come
through
from
time
to
time
this
brew
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
somewhat
cloying
for
my
palate
not
that
i
would
never
drink
it
again
but
it
wont
worry
me
to
not
have
it
more
then
once
a
year
this
is
a
sipper
not
an
overly
drinkable
brew
more
like
a
heavily
malted
sweet
barley
wine
then
a
typical
belgian
ale
many
thanks
to
paquette
for
this
gift
as
for
the
taste
it
reminded
me
of
really
sweet
rose
water
the
thick
very
sweet
orangevinegar
background
definitely
was
not
pleasant
not
sure
if
this
was
a
skunked
bottle
or
if
i
just
couldnt
take
this
sickingly
sweet
beer
overall
im
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
think
that
from
time
to
time
i
will
go
back
to
it
being
a
fan
of
de
dolle
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
stille
nacht
unfortunately
it
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
served
from
the
trademark
11
2
oz
belgian
brown
bottle
its
a
nicelooking
copper
with
goodsized
chunks
of
floating
yeast
despite
a
careful
pour
the
head
disappears
almost
immediately
the
smell
is
funky
belgian
yeast
and
sugary
sweetness
however
the
sweet
smell
is
not
adequate
preparation
for
the
overwhelming
sweetness
of
the
taste
its
sticky
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
a
cherry
soda
no
hop
bitterness
or
trace
of
sourness
balances
the
mouthcoating
effect
of
sugarsoaked
cherries
that
makes
this
beer
a
labor
to
finish
oh
well
no
brewery
is
perfect
brown
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
i
could
not
produce
much
of
a
head
on
this
beer
what
was
present
disappeared
quickly
almost
no
lacing
on
my
glass
as
i
drank
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
presence
this
beer
tastes
very
sweet
a
touch
caramel
and
butterscotch
this
beer
does
a
have
a
good
medium
body
to
it
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
presence
this
is
an
interesting
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
holidays
to
enjoy
slowly
i
will
look
for
this
again
next
year
i
could
not
drink
this
beer
or
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
and
tried
with
each
drink
to
convince
myself
it
was
good
unfortunately
i
could
not
get
myself
to
like
this
beer
im
not
sure
this
was
what
they
intended
but
it
is
disappointing
drinkability
this
selection
will
be
on
my
christmastime
sipper
list
a
strange
bird
but
nice
and
warming
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
strong
dark
aleit
aint
much
in
the
color
department
and
a
big
zero
in
the
headage
departmentzilch
aromas
flavors
and
textures
are
big
rich
and
syrupy
in
nature
in
fact
the
beer
almost
looks
like
maple
syrup
coming
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
more
of
a
dessert
or
kick
back
in
bed
and
read
a
book
while
sipping
beer
than
anything
else
the
flavors
favor
gooey
malt
extract
that
come
off
in
a
big
fruit
cocktail
like
style
i
will
say
that
while
i
am
sipping
this
brew
we
are
having
a
snow
storm
out
the
window
and
this
is
quite
the
comforting
beverage
simply
expect
this
to
be
a
hedonistic
fruit
driven
over
the
top
drink
and
youl
dig
it
as
i
drew
near
the
end
of
the
glass
i
wished
that
i
had
another
but
alas
i
did
not
this
beer
is
why
i
review
styles
i
do
not
care
for
so
that
i
can
better
appreciate
all
styles
and
come
to
know
variations
within
each
style
this
is
especially
true
with
belgians
that
are
so
broad
ranging
this
is
one
strange
beer
it
had
a
lot
of
earthiness
at
first
with
spices
and
vegetable
flavors
alcohol
came
in
large
gusts
a
few
sips
later
it
was
very
sweet
with
minimal
spiciness
a
few
other
swigs
had
it
tasting
like
brandy
the
complexity
was
nice
but
it
really
didnt
all
go
together
that
well
i
usually
like
something
new
and
strange
to
me
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
sweet
stille
nacht
is
soooo
sweet
maybe
the
sweetest
beer
i
ever
had
however
i
like
sweet
so
i
liked
it
it
was
a
pretty
orangey
amber
color
with
a
big
head
smelled
like
honey
and
wine
and
spiced
apples
in
there
too
it
tasted
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smelled
with
that
sweetened
honey
flavour
predominating
i
liked
it
but
it
was
almost
syrupy
a
bit
too
thick
for
my
liking
and
i
definintely
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
this
stuff
i
might
try
it
again
in
a
year
ill
be
due
for
another
by
then
this
bottle
was
a
little
bit
too
sweet
aging
will
probably
do
a
lot
to
this
beer
other
quaffed
in
honor
of
the
pumpkin
sculpture
i
made
for
my
workplaces
2nd
annual
pumpkin
decorating
contest
i
took
three
small
white
pumpkins
of
different
sizes
hollowed
one
out
and
then
made
a
snowman
out
of
it
pictures
available
upon
request
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
and
im
absolutely
confused
drinkability

this
is
almost
like
an
aperitif
wine
it
is
very
fruity
smooth
clean
sweet
and
inviting
a
deep
golden
color
with
amber
notes
to
it
pours
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
it
looks
quite
thick
as
it
is
poured
into
the
glass
and
is
very
lightly
carbonated
smells
of
honey
and
a
general
fruitiness
tastes
thick
complex
sweet
with
a
strong
honey
note
to
it
this
beer
is
also
lightly
sour
which
balances
wonderfully
with
the
sweetness
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
and
is
incredibly
well
balanced

thanks
so
much
to
johnnyduvel
for
this
one
12
oz
euro
bottle
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
massive
head
that
slowly
receded
aroma
of
malt
and
fruit
taste
is
a
complex
blend
of
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
bitter
finish
it
is
rather
hard
to
describe
more
like
a
barleywine
in
the
complex
flavors
this
one
is
hard
to
place
not
bad
but
not
something
id
have
again
soon
this
was
the
biggest
head
on
a
beer
that
i
have
witnessed
since
i
started
rating
beers
wow
the
head
was
offwhite
with
medium
bubbles
the
nose
was
that
of
clove
fruits
and
some
sweetness
the
carbonation
was
fizzy
and
the
lacing
was
excellent
with
this
beer
the
taste
was
that
of
alcohol
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
due
to
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
the
body
was
murky
and
the
hue
was
pale
orange
the
mouthfeel
was
a
burning
sensation
in
my
throat
as
well
as
a
warm
sensation
as
it
was
digested
all
in
all
a
good
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
having
the
experience
of
drinking
and
rating
this
is
a
very
complex
belgian
it
improved
as
it
warmed
a
little
thick
dense
head
but
the
taste
and
appearance
of
the
beer
proved
it
to
be
rather
lighter
than
many
belgians
the
initial
note
is
of
a
honey
flavor
coming
forth
followed
by
a
spicyness
that
seemed
a
little
too
strong
for
my
liking
a
fruity
sweetness
came
forth
next
to
offset
the
spicyness
the
beer
finished
with
a
yeasty
dryness
that
left
me
wanting
more
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
im
not
sure
if
the
vintage
and
aging
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
im
certainly
going
to
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
remember
kids
dont
chill
a
beer
let
it
warm
up
and
then
open
it
especially
a
highly
carbonated
belgian
like
this
large
misshapen
head
is
out
of
control
peach
lemon
zest
salty
alcohol
a
little
too
noticeable
and
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
cloying
surprisingly
bitter
finish
cloudy
amber
lots
of
tiny
bits
floating
about
and
millions
of
tiny
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
aroma
is
big
and
fruity
apple
and
pear
mostly
some
alcohol
showing
too
flavor
is
super
sweet
mostly
apple
ends
with
the
alcohol
poking
through
medium
body
alcohol
becomes
more
and
more
prominent
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
the
bottle
1982
vintage
first
year
10
euros
at
the
kulminator
and
personally
selected
by
dirk
and
leen
as
are
final
beer
in
belgium
a
deep
amberish
colour
with
a
frothy
white
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
excellent
and
consist
of
cotton
candy
funky
belgian
yeast
sweet
candied
fruits
alcohol
red
wine
and
more
the
taste
is
so
freaking
complex
that
it
is
hard
to
describe
cherries
belgian
lambic
funk
sour
red
qualities
sugar
fruity
nonfruit
sweetness
bubble
gum
other
various
spices
and
fruits
and
more
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
id
probably
rate
this
vintage
at
a
perfect
5
pours
a
murky
looking
dirty
amber
color
huge
bubbly
white
head
fizzy
and
efferfescent
great
retention
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
to
say
the
least
melons
mango
grape
skin
apricot
pretty
nice
though
the
flavors
of
this
definitely
tip
the
scale
on
the
sweet
side
in
a
harvest
ale
sort
of
way
though
sweet
passion
fruit
and
dark
cherry
rise
up
a
hint
of
alcohol
maybe
some
spicing
like
orange
curacao
nutmeg
ginger
or
corriander
i
do
notice
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
pretty
nice
whatever
i
cant
deal
with
this
one
i
could
smell
this
brew
even
before
i
poured
it
cloudy
deep
amber
with
a
beautiful
head
champagne
like
carbonation
keeps
the
head
alive
long
after
the
pour
i
see
some
floaties
hovering
around
inside
the
glass
smells
sweet
like
a
wine
hints
of
pineapple
my
first
sip
sets
me
back
pineapple
and
apricot
flavors
jump
out
at
me
followed
by
an
alcohol
warmth
no
hoppiness
to
speak
of
just
sweet
and
fruity
very
creamy
and
thick
on
my
tounge
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
like
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
tart
for
me
this
beer
poured
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
an
off
white
bubbly
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
heavy
aroma
of
malt
and
fruit
with
almost
wine
like
aspects
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
fruit
and
an
interesting
finish
i
have
trouble
figuring
this
beer
out
because
it
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
an
dessert
wine
more
than
a
beer
i
would
consider
this
a
night
cap
kind
of
beer
this
is
first
beer
ive
reviewed
where
the
scores
varied
so
much
this
is
my
second
review
of
a
de
dolle
beer
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
cloudy
brown
in
great
similarity
to
the
ara
bier
stille
nacht
has
a
ton
of
head
that
seemingly
never
reduces
into
a
rich
thick
white
head
lace
is
very
nice
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
is
dominated
by
apricot
but
still
manages
to
be
just
a
little
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
get
a
very
hittle
hint
of
hops
in
the
beer
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
finishes
a
little
dry
defiantly
a
warming
feeling
on
the
way
down
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
cloudy
golden
color
despite
my
best
efforts
a
huge
explosive
head
erupts
from
the
bottle
head
is
rocky
and
lasts
forever
full
bubbly
and
beige
full
of
sweet
citrus
aroamas
grapefruit
slight
orange
peel
and
subtle
spices
taste
is
at
first
full
of
citrus
and
rich
yeasty
taste
very
typical
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
a
dark
but
thats
what
it
says
as
the
subtle
yeast
flavors
fade
an
overwhelming
sweet
candied
fruit
taste
slides
by
an
finishes
the
beer
complex
flavor
combinations
confuse
the
taste
buds
but
the
sweetness
is
striking
and
overbearing
very
slick
but
not
syrupy
super
sweet
finish
lingers
harder
to
handle
as
it
warms
turns
into
a
slow
sipping
beer
and
at
8
it
probably
is
meant
to
be
a
night
cap
a
very
interesting
complex
and
tasty
beer
just
a
bit
to
sweet
to
be
really
outstanding
a
unique
brew
that
demands
a
lot
attractive
depth
of
color
and
powerful
head
retention
definite
alcohol
presence
in
the
nose
sweet
as
the
dickens
at
first
sip
rounded
of
slightly
by
some
hops
somewhere
in
the
distant
background
and
some
muddled
yeastiness
if
the
sweetness
isnt
enough
to
floor
you
the
alcoholic
content
kicks
in
on
the
followup
lots
of
candy
sugars
are
right
there
in
the
moderately
full
mouthfeel
together
with
a
good
warmth
followed
by
a
finish
that
either
leaves
you
gasping
for
air
or
gasping
for
more
although
quite
impressive
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
when
my
taste
buds
deteriorate
not
a
beer
for
the
weakhearted
bloody
marvellous
hazy
copper
hue
topped
by
a
tremendously
dense
and
persistent
ivory
white
head
doesnt
look
like
a
dark
strong
at
all
ripe
fruit
sweetness
citrus
rind
sugary
honey
w
a
hint
of
buttery
sweet
bready
malt
in
aroma
sugary
candy
like
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
is
ensued
by
musty
yeast
flavors
and
assertive
non
descript
spiciness
ripe
perhaps
overly
ripe
sweet
fruit
abounds
and
when
coupled
with
initial
sugary
sweetness
the
overall
profile
is
very
sweet
and
just
a
hair
of
being
cloying
hop
bitterness
is
virtually
nonexistant
moderately
bodied
finishes
w
lingering
fructose
like
sweetness
lingering
stille
nacht
is
a
complex
brew
but
the
residual
sweetness
is
a
bit
offputting
and
hurts
the
drinkability
it
falls
short
of
its
aromas
promise
that
being
said
its
still
worth
a
shot
due
to
its
uniqueness
its
a
stylistic
bastard
a
strange
beer
definitely
kind
of
sweet
aroma
and
taste
but
before
passing
judgment
on
this
beer
you
kind
of
have
to
stop
and
think
to
me
it
was
quite
sweet
and
not
overly
impressive
but
there
is
a
time
for
it
for
sure
kind
of
a
dessert
wine
character
and
more
impressive
with
every
sip
acidic
lemon
flavour
combines
with
a
orangy
marmalade
flavour
interesting
unique
a
strange
beer
too
much
sweet
smell
and
taste
a
cottonwool
taste
too
much
sweet
again
and
even
unbalanced
to
the
alcohlic
a
delusion
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
beers
another
of
the
monks
cafe
selections
i
tried
this
on
recommendation
from
a
friend
nice
fruity
character
that
is
not
too
overwhelming
smooth
finish
purchased
at
tbrugs
beertje
back
in
april
2000
thanks
daisy
overall
like
this
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
belgium
strong
pale
or
dark
too
sweet
and
little
too
much
alcohol
burn
amazing
beer
one
of
my
favorites
yeah
they
should
make
it
more
balanced
probably
my
baseline
for
belgian
brews
great
stuff
likely
on
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
within
the
class
i
find
this
to
be
a
strong
solid
brew
the
nose
is
fig
newton
and
honey
taste
follows
closely
with
a
warm
clean
finish
and
virtually
no
hop
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
copper
in
color
only
mildly
funky
decent
body
has
ripe
light
fruit
malt
caramel
not
much
hop
action
on
the
nose
pours
dark
amber
with
a
slight
haze
under
a

that
produces
delicate

rich

flavors
introduce
the
palate
with
traces
of
caramel
light
malts
a
faint
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
trace
of
anise
with
a
little
brown
ale
character
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
throughout
and
may
be
cloying
to
some
the
balance
leans
more
towards
the
malt
than
yeasty
esters
the
carbonation
is
medium
low
with
a
medium
full
body
really
good
ale
sweet
finish
i
recommend
you
try
if
you
can
get
it
oh
this
might
be
my
other
favorite
beer
such
a
deep
flavor
and
not
to
heavy

a
clear

like
this

and
the

would
buy
again
but
probably
not
on
a

basis
nice
belgian
quality
but
lower

and
less

than
i
prefer
personal
notereminds

of

yeasty
flavor
thanks
to
an
awesome
bartender
at
liberty
tap
room
in
mount
pleasant
sc
i
was
able
to
take
home
one
of
their
iconic
kwak
woodhandled
beer
glasses
it
might
be
a
gimmick
but
it
absolutely
adds
to
the
experience
im
hoping
the
bottled
variety
is
as
delicious
as
i
remember
from
that
trip
to
the
tap
room
the
cloudy
tarnished
copper
liquid
pours
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
foam
maybe
part
of
it
is
the
shape
of
the
glass
with
the
spherical
bottom
but
either
way
thats
a
lot
of
foam
as
it
settles
down
theres
splotchy
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
bears
a
strange
metallic
scent
like
a
handful
of
pennies
with
traces
of
banana
a
little
buttery
toffee
in
the
nose
too
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
clove
bitterness
its
a
tad
cidery
imparting
a
tangy
flash
of
flavor
theres
a
buttery
honey
sweet
breadlike
taste
that
reminds
me
a
little
of
sticky
buns
a
little
funky
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
banana
esters
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
here
is
thinly
veiled
lending
a
boozy
solventlike
layer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
that
may
be
a
touch
too
lively
in
total
this
is
a
tasty
belgian
strong
ale
that
lacks
some
of
the
finesse
and
character
of
its
contemporaries
not
quite
as
refined
as
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
but
delicious
nonetheless
perhaps
if
they
put
as
much
work
in
to
the
beer
as
the
glass
it
would
be
worldclass
quality
beer
although
not
in
the
same
class
as
its
contemporaries
with
its
iconic
glass
it
is
a
musttry
good
aftertaste
with
high
abv
its
been
far
too
long
since
first
i
tried
this
beer
and
i
just
couldnt
keep
away
from
that
snazzy
glass
it
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
candied
orange
peel
belgian
yeast
clove
light
dry
caramel
light
grass
and
a
bit
of
vague
breadiness
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
belgian
yeast
really
driving
through
some
fruity
and
spicy
notes
to
balance
out
the
caramelladen
biscuit
residing
throughout
the
background
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
bspa
one
that
has
earned
its
place
as
one
of
the
constant
belgian
offerings
at
nearby
watering
holes
overall
its
right
down
the
middle
bordering
on
meh
its
a
blegian
to
be
sure
just
not
one
id
buy
again
due
to
the
superiority
of
other
similar
beers
for
the
same
price
out
there
kwak
would
be
a
good
scrabble
word
on
tap
served
in
a
tall
funky
glass
in
a
stand
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
belgian
ale
that
does
nothing
wrong
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
perfectly
balanced
giving
the
drinker
plenty
to
explore
and
savor
during
the
experience
neither
the
yeast
nor
the
carbonation
are
overbearing
giving
the
deft
malt
character
the
opportunity
to
shine
for
all
its
nuance
and
complexity
kwak
remains
supremely
drinkable
highly
recommended
decent
blond
beer
but
needs
to
be
drunk
with
special
glass
awhile
since
i
last
had
this
beer
and
now
i
remember

fairly
strong
at

it
does
taste
of
alcohol
on

has
a

more
warmth
to
it
when
it
hits
in
the
belly
which
is
similar
to
whiskey
like
a
lot
of
belgium
beers
this
one
has
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
pallet
but
leaves
an
after
taste
like
amstel
amazing
o
this
is
a
nice
middle
ground
between
session
and
refresher
beers
and
strong
knock
you
out
beers
its
good
at
the
end
of
a
busy
day
without
ending
your
day
a
good
ale
with
for
me
a
bit
too
much
fruity
and
not
enough
malty
murky
mahogany
brown
in
color
with
a
minuscule
trace
of

covering
half
of
the
top

aroma

strongly
centered
around
dark

with
a

sugar
the
taste

exactly
as
the
aroma
advertised
light
brussels
lacing
the
mouth
is
fairly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
not
as
drinkable
as
most
other
bspas
its
not
terrible
but
it
kind
of
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
flavorwise
i
wont
be
going
after
the
kwak
again
taste
palate
now
on
the
tongue
the
bready
belgian
yeast
notes
hop
out
first
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
and
apples
move
in
with
sweet
maltiness
in
the
middle
there
is
an
attempt
by
the
hops
to
come
out
and
play
but
the
yeast
notes
and
malt
notes
and
now
some
sweet
boozy
notes
hold
out
and
finish
strong
the
body
feels
smooth
with
lots
of
fine
carbonation
just
right
for
a
big
belgian
ale
thats
when
the
high
effervescence
lifts
the
taste
and
refreshes
the
palate
with
ease
its
steely
caramel
flavor
dissolves
easily
carrying

in
this
regard
on
the
fizzy
side
does
not
reach
the
lofty
heights
of
some
of
its
countrymen
but
worth
sampling
on
tap
do
not
be
entirely
dissuaded
by
the
gimmicky
glass
does
feature
the
expected
esteryphenolic
belgian

profile
and
not
super
sweet
oabsolutely
wonderful
happiness
in
a
glass
extremely
well
balanced
alright
but
not
outstanding
looks
ok
with
a
satisfyingly
complex
aroma
of
dried
fruit
caramel
and
yeast
the
flavour
is
similar
yet
somehow
lacklustre
difficult
to
pinpoint
but
perhaps
too
sweet
and
cloying
faint
harsh
undertones
dont
help

is
acceptable
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
no
need
to

had
this
on

a
couple
of
times
pours
a
deep
orangeish
almost
a
brown
tone
fruits
of
the
pearapple
variety
along
with
a
touch
of
white
grapes
and
a
slight
hint
of
must
but
not
really
much
else
going
on
none
of
the
classic
belgian
yeastbready
aromas
flavor
is
about
the
same
nothing
great
nothing
bad
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
which
is
a
good
thing
a
rather
lackluster
beer
with
not
too
much
going
on
fairly
standard
nothing
to
wet
your
pants
about
o
a
good
belgian
ale
but
bettered
by
a
good
number
of
competitors
certainly
worth
trying
medium
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
and
buying
again
in
my
opinion
o
not
the
best
beer
they
make
but
its
still
a
tasty
belgian
ale
glad
to
say
this
tastes
better
than
i
thought
it
would
the
smell
lets
it
down
a
bit
but
then
beer
is
meant
to
be
drunk
not
smelt
overall
i
had
this
beer
around
a
year
or
so
ago
as
i
was
cutting
my
teeth
on
styles
of
beer
other
than
lager
this
was
an
awesome
entrance
into
the
world
of
international
ales
and
still
hovers
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
beers
a
great
easydrinking
higher
abv
ale
which
is
silky
smooth
without
the
harshness
that
can
sometimes
accompany
such
high
abv
price
point
10
99750
ml
bottle
overall
enjoyable
but
there
are
other
belgian
strongs
that
are
better
choices
kwak
pours
a
bronze
color
with
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
aroma
with
a
strong
yeast
flavor
lots
of
belgian
candies
the
taste
is
similar
sweet
taste
with
a
lot
of
belgian
candy
flavors
and
strong
hints
of
yeast
full
flavor
good
body
sweet
overall
a
nice
sweet
beer
i
like
kwak
for
what
it
is
a
strong
belgian
amber
with
appley
character
good
beer
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
malt
with
a
mild
yeast
fruitiness
and
and
a
gentle
spice
quality
with
mild
hop
flavor
which
adds
to
the
caramel
element
from
the
malt
with
an
almost
candylike
flavor
with
a
semidry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
belgian
ale
i
had
this
a
few
times
before
and
was
glad
to
revisit
this
as
it
was
easy
on
the
palate
considering
the
strength
thanks
again
erik
cheers
kwak
is
an
interesting
hybrid
sort
of
belgian
ale
sitting
halfway
between
a
pale
and
a
dark
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
a
bit
overly
sweet
beer
though
the
prior
time
i
had
it
was
very
cold
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
greatly
but
it
was
on
bottle
maybe
it
was
badly
served
from
tap
overall
good
solid
beer
amazing
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
worth
trying
based
on
that
alone
the
taste
is
far
sweeter
than
i
would
expect
from
a
belgian
strong
ale
that
is
not
to
say
it
is
bad
because
it
also
has
those
same
bready
yeasty
and
dark
fruity
notes
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
dark
redamber
very
little
foam
that
disappears
quickly
strong
smell
of
malts
and
some
sweet
maybe
honey
taste
is
mainly
roasted
malts
with
average
hops
and
strong
yeast
its
got
a
strange
aftertaste
i
couldnt
idenfity
alcohol
is
well
masked
under
the
strong
malts
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
well
balanced
o
a
bit
light
across
the
board
smell
taste
mouthfeel
alcohol
strikes
me
as
the
predominate
flavor
fairly
underwhelming
and
not
a
whole
lot
to
speak
highly
of
oh
well
you
win
some
you
lose
some
o
honestly
the
novelty
of
the
glass
is
all
that
this
has
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
but
there
are
many
better
examples
overall
not
the
best
the
belgian
but
not
bad
i
would
like
to
age
one
and
see
how
it
tastes
after
a
couple
of
years
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
this
one
out
but
it
is
deffinately
better
than
most
beers
out
there
o
my
unwavering
ratings
of
4
in
every
category
are
the
opposite
of
this
bspa
its
nuanced
and
i
hesitate
to
call
it
complex
but
it
will
keep
you
entertained
like
the
numbers
say
outstanding
in
every
category
i
only
didnt
bump
some
categories
up
a
bit
because
i
feel
its
almost
more
like
a
tripel
than
its
labeled
variety
if
you
come
across
it
id
suggest
a
taste
especially
if
in
a
bar
where
they
serve
it
in
its
proper
glassware
and
wooden
holder
google
pictures
of
it
just
be
ready
to
get
judgmental
glances
from
mcb
diehards
and
maybe
some

that
screams
the

at

in

states
a
unique
bouquet
of
bitter

and
sweet
that
keeps
one
engaged
though
the
whole
glass
would
be
quite
fun
to
pair
with
food
overall
a
well
crafted
if
a
bit
too
sweet
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
booze
isnt
terribly
well
hidden
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
an
inviting
flavor
with
plenty
of
sweetness
and
the
devilish
ability
to
get
yourself
into
trouble
if
you
dont
stop
after
one
or
two
this
brew
is
rather
goofy
like
its
name
and
the
glass
its
traditionally
poured
in
although
socially
gangly
it
will
dance
with
southeast
asian
cuisine
quite
nicely
and
giving
the
clown
some
solo
attention
is
certainly
warranted
too
brought
to
you
by
the
folks
who
have
made
a
twofoottall
pissing
toddler
a
provicial
icon
you
gotta
at
least
try
the
beer
overall
drinkability
very
good
with
food
had
this
with
welsh
chti
think
welsh
rabbit
but
with
potatoes
ham
and
bacon
under
the
cheese
on
top
of
toast
all
cooked
up
in
a
gratin
dish
which
was
great
and
this
beer
was
so
dangerously
drinkable
i
wanted
another
but
knew
i
would
regret
it
if
i
did
a
very
good
beer
and
i
hope
to
have
it
again
someday
o
a
buddy
gave
me
this
beer
citing
that
it
was
awful
i
thought
it
was
decent
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
favorite
but
it
is
certainly
not
awful
remarks
wish
i
had
bought
the

when
i
had
the
chance
ill
have
to
look
around
for
one
did
not
score

disregard
those
scores
serving
type
11
2
oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pauwel
kwak
coachmans
glass
overall
id
say
this
is
one
thats
got
a
rich
somewhat
complex
taste
but
which
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
relatively
high
degree
of
effervesence
its
now
on
my
list
list
of
beers
i
definitely
like
o
ive
had
this
several
times
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
its
good
although
half
way
through
i
reached
the
conclusion
i
was
over
paying
for
the
privilege
of
drinking
this
from
the
test
tube
and
accompanying
wooden
holder
o
an
interestingly
flavored
beer
typical
belgian
characteristics
with
a
unique
flavor
if
this
is
what
belgium
exports
can
you
only
imagine
what
they
keep
to
themselves
i
tend
to
love
sweet
malty
brews
that
can
play
as
dessert
as
well
as
with
food
so
this
suits
me
very
well
i
could
see
some
thinking
it
a
bit
overtly
rich
now
my
current
favorite
belgian
the
body
is
thinmedium
some
tingly
carbonation
kwak
i
am
sad
you
arent
better
than
this
maybe
its
because
i
didnt
drink
from
the
traditional
kwak
glass
i
will
post
a
photo
of
the
kwak
glass
on
facebook
and
twitter
if
you
want
to
see
what
that
looks
like
oh
well
cant
enjoy
them
all
by
the
way
if
brouwerij
bosteels
wants
to
reimburse
me
that
would
be
fine
ive
always
considered
this
a
very
good
bier
especially
memorable
if
you
use
the
proper
glass
anyway
i
think
its
just
a
very
tasty
beer
like
so
many
of
my
friends
who
love
it
even
more
its
sweet
but
also
has
a
sour
yeastiness
to
it
giving
it
more
balance
and
complexity
together
with
a
very
mild
bitter
finish
with
fruits
and
malts
its
just
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
drinkability
surprisingly
quite
drinkable
even
if
its
characteristics
when
taken
individualy
are
not
exactly
to
my
liking
maybe
i
was
just
in
a
good
mood
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
intricate
expierence
with
more
sophistication
average
to
me
but
a
great
representation
of
the
style
if
you
are
willing
to
spring
for
the
whole
kwak
paraphernalia
which
i
discovered
in
bruge
this
is
a
worthwhile
experience
so
enjoy
the
kwak
if
you
tip
up
a
tad
to
quickly
as
far
as
belgian
ale
this
one
holds
its
own
compared
to
zotish
style
ale
it
is
middle
of
the
road
for
good
belgian
ales
but
definitely
drinkable
not
overly
complex
a
little
caramel
banana
and
slight
nutty
finish
reasonable
alcholol
cover
and
slight
sweetness
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
to
drink
enjoy
and
not
worry
about
style
or
flavor
on
the
other
hand
quite
fun
to
enjoy
the
pauwel
kwak
drinking
system
which
is
like
no
other
one
reviewer
called
it
a
mad
scientist
contraption
i
would
say
interesting
and
make
sure
you
dont
embarrass
yourself
pulling
the
round
bottom
glass
out
of
the
wood
stand
to
sip
pay
attention
and
use
your
ingenuity
figuring
it
out
final
grade

an
excellent
b
pauwel
kwak
makes
for
a
worthwhile
tipple
though
as
far
as
belgian
pale
ales
go
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
particularly
exceptional
offering
id
be
hesitant
to
place
this
stuff
on
the
same
tier
as
my
favourite
bspas
duvel
and
la
chouffe
but
its
still
a
quaffable
strong
ale
in
its
own
right
with
higher
drinkability
than
average
if
youre
looking
for
an
affordable
strong
belgian
pale
to
enjoy
this
winter
kwak
fits
the
bill
nicely
o
a
tasty
brew
indeed
dangerously
drinkable
and
a
pleasant
brew
to
find
at
the
local
lcbo
o
a
good
refreshing
belgian
brown
a
solid
beer
not
very
special
for
me
though
rjt
overall
not
bad
but
not
a
beer
i
would
go
to
when
in
the
mood
for
a
bspa
too
chewy
and
bready
for
me
o
just
not
into
this
one
found
it
pretty
average
for
the
style
overall
started
off
a
little
interesting
but
really
flattens
out
over
time
due
to
a
lack
of
depth
and
a
sticky
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
body
decent
carbonation
slightly
syrupy
reddish
brown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
eggshell
head
moderate
lace
and
retention
malty
nose
caramel
but
juggles
by
some
by
some
pear
red
delicious
apple
and
a
light
herbal
and
spicy
character
to
the
hops
taste
has
yeast
and
a
lunch
of
spice
upfront
sweeter
malts
a
touch
of
copper
and
spicy
hop
character
medium
feel
drying
yea
medium
high
carbonation
adequate
belgian
strong
ale
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
overall
better
than
i
had
expected
based
on
previous
reviews
my
bottle
was
almost
at
its
best
before
date
so
perhaps
this
beer
develops
well
over
time
id
buydrink
it
again
anytime
overall
this
is
a
very
cool
beer
mostly
because
of
the
glass
as
far
as
the
beer
in
the
glass
it
is
solid
but
not
stand
out
pale
amber

one

of

some

nose
is
of
sweet
candy
malty
and
some
juicy
fruits
start
to
show
themselves
as
well
spicy
bits
of

and
a
bit
yeasty
taste
is
big
and
malty
fruity
with
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
apple
and
orange
flavours
yeasty
points
more
fruit
in
the
finish
with
some
spice
mostly
clove
and
pepper
lightmed
carbonation
medium
body
with
some
fuller
points
as
well
this
is
a
good
although
fairly
sweet
belgian
abv
goes
largely
undetected
but
still
not
a
stand
out
for
me
anyway

doesnt

i

that
i
would
like
with
the
style
slightly
metallic
dry

of
course
it
is
a
good

but
for

i

pick
up
another
belgian
strong

an
enjoyable

o
yum
i
loved
it
the
back
abbey
in
my
area
had
it
on
tap
but
unfortunately
ran
out
that
night
i
want
more
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
on
tap
such
a
great
beer
if
you
like
belgians
and
you
want
a
decent
price
pick
this
up
food
match
would
lean
towards
desserts
with
a
brew
this
sweet
something
along
the
lines
of
a
baked
custard
tart
portuguese
style
or
if
you
were
really
interested
in
something
savoury
baked
lamb
with
mint
and
almond
pesto
for
a
nice

poured
into
the
duvel
tulip
glass
small

which
didnt
stay
very
long
spotty
lacing
or
just
spots
as
its
drunk
down
beautiful
copper
color
probably
its
best
trait
like
the
other
reviews
have
said
it
lacks
in
taste
and
is
easier
to
drink
than
its
other
strong
ale
cousins
but
its
not
bad
and
for
8
4
abv
it
goes
down
relatively
well
it
could
be
belgiums
budweiser
or
lawn
mower
ale
but
with
a
heftier
punch
but
no
its
not
as
bad
as
a
bud
o
good
drinker
good
way
to
finish
the
day
very
good
for
the
style
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
the
tobu
department
store
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
poured
into
a
rochefort
goblet
the
looks
of
this
are
okay
bubbling
up
from
a
dark
amber
hue
with
foamy
petri
dish
style
foam
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
around
the
edges
however
the
smell
and
the
taste
for
this
just
paled
in
comparison
to
other
strong
belgians
not
much
else
beyond
a
hop
scent
and
the
taste
left
me
wanting
more
overall
this
is
still
a
highquality
beer
but
nothing
like
its
more
superior
cousin
brews
i
liked
this
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
slightly
fruity
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
sweet
and
malty
flavor
that
i
am
enjoying
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
robust
malt
presence
with
enough
spice
to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
fruits
are
good
o
i
appreciate
what
theyre
trying
to
do
but
i
think
they
just
tried
to
make
this
beer
too
much
i
could
see
how
this
beer
might
hit
some
peoples
palate
just
right
and
they
love
it
but
i
think
its
not
balanced
well
and
doesnt
finish
quite
clean
enough
overall
a
great
beer
o
decent
strong
belgian
ale
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
for
still
went
down
easy
mouthfeel
is
slightly
grainy
overall
pretty
good
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
to
be
honest
i
only
purchased
this
beer
due
to
the
glassware
section
of
the
store
wherein
i
saw
a
cool
little
wooden
case
and
glass
specifically
made
for
the
beer
poured
from
bottle
undated
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
arrives
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
1
5
finger
white
bubbly
head
with
some
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
disappointing
mild
caramel
sweet
character
perhaps
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
but
nothing
else
really
to
report
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
impressive
as
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
blends
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
provides
a
pleasing
flavor
mildly
bitter
with
little
hop
character
the
beer
is
rather
sweet
and
mild
finishes
crisp
and
clean
and
sweet
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
nothing
special
really
but
not
terrible
the
glass
and
wooden
case
were
cooler
for
a
quad
this
is
a
great
smooth
summer
ale
yes
sir
drink
this
beer
when
belgian
play
in
the
summer
european
cup
soccer
match
i
might
recommend
something
like
weather
report
to
listen
with
kwak
o
above
average
beer
a
bit
dusty
very
sweet
but
to
be
fair
i
like
sweet
good
overall
would
really
only
have
one
at
a
sitting
served
in
a
tall
glass
with
a
wooden
holder
strong
but
pleasant
a
pleasant
beer
with
a
very
nice
taste
and
finish
hard
to
have
more
than
one
though
different
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
definitely
not
a
strong
pale
ale
its
quite
drinkable
because
of
the
mouthfeel
may
get
it
again
because
of
the
price
of
a
small
bottle
o
not
so
special
but
ok
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
o
a
very
ordinary
beer
that
is
disappointing
not
used
to
such
mediocrity
of
a
belgian
beer
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
just
something
that
i
could
not
get
excited
about
or
have
again
poured
into
one
of
those
crazy
wooden
handled
glass
trumpet
shaped
glassholder
devices
that
im
sure
has
a
proper
name
and
for
this
it
gets
bonus
points
cheeky
monk
in
denver
has
a
nice
redorange
glow
some
cloudiness
and
a
small
white
head
lovely
smells
really
yeasty
almost
sour
if
you
think
about
it
like
that
some
notes
of
dried
fruit
as
well
flavor
just
isnt
my
favorite
for
a
belgian
its
tart
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
but
not
in
the
right
proportion
it
kind
of
filled
me
up
too
which
is
uncommon
for
this
style
the
yeast
dominates
the
flavor
with
subtle
notes
of
dried
cherries
and
raw
sugar
feel
is
nice
and
bubbly
crisper
than
most
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
on
a
night
of
drinking
fine
belgian
ales
this
one
did
not
stand
out
o
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
also
a
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
belgian
ale
i
enjoyed
the
blend
of
flavors
but
wasnt
blown
away
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solidly
average
brew
it
was
interesting
to
get
those
grape
tastes
but
it
when
the
pieces
came
together
it
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
its
a
strange
beer
i
dont
recall
any
other
type
of
pale
ale
that
lacked
even
a
remote
bitterness
and
instead
was
so
sweet
its
still
a
decent
beer
just
categorized
wrong
oa
really
well
put
together
beer
complex
and
balanced
very
nicely
thebeeralmanac
com
o
a
nice
strong
pale
ale
the
flavor
in
the
beer
is
good
but
to
me
it
lacks
the
depth
of
other
strong
pale
ales
the
fruit
flavors
in
this
beer
are
much
stronger
than
others
in
its
class
d
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
one
again
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
sweet
apple
and
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
clear
coppery
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
some
respectable
lacing
scrumptious
flavor
has
firm
notes
of
malt
caramel
and
apple
and
just
a
hint
of
cloves
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
and
these
two
components
nicely
balance
each
other
smooth
fullbodied
texture
has
a
firm
fizz
and
leaves
a
subtle
tingle
and
a
malty
fruity
finish
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
kwak
again
but
i
love
these
kwak
glasses
i
was
gifted
so
ill
be
seeing
the
brand
in
my
future
this
beer
started
great
with
the
pour
hints
of
belgian
sugar
aroma
and
the
taste
had
the
typical
big
dark
tropical
fruit
start
but
didnt
follow
through
and
left
me
wanting
more
smell
a
bit
hoppy
and
some
definite
funk
but
tastes
leave
me
wanting
just
a
bit
more
especially
with
this
high
abv
expected
more
depth
of
character
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
kwak
glass
which
came
as
part
of
a
gift
set
sort
of
a
flute
tulip
hybrid
pretty
cool
stuff
this
pours
a
tea
brown
color
with
a
massive
off
white
head
which
seems
to
have
pretty
good
retention
the
smells
are
wonderful
full
of
dark
ripe
fruit
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
lovely
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
but
a
little
disappointing
after
the
wonderful
nose
there
is
the
hint
of
the
ripe
fruit
and
malts
but
its
a
little
thin
and
the
alcohol
isnt
covered
up
very
well
at
all
great
nose
look
but
slightly
disappointing
on
the
taste
overall
some
nice
flavors
going
on
but
too
sweet
and
syrupy
to
be
top
notch
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
better
options
in
the
style
especially
when
you
consider
the
price
of
this
beer
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
with
very
thin
creamy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
nothing
lacing
refused
to
cling
nose
tended
toward
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
the
thin
taste
had
a
bit
of
alcohol
tinge
to
it
but
nothing
too
powerful
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
little
aftertaste
when
i
purchased
this
i
was
hoping
for
bangup
belgian
ale
but
was
sorely
disappointed
will
not
buy
again
o
bought
this
because
of
the
name
i
thought
it
was
the
same
name
as
one
of
my
current
professors
turns
out
the
o
is
an
a
and
i
am
always
up
for
trying
a
beer
i
have
to
uncork
overall
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
if
you
like
the
belgian
style
you
will
probably
agree
and
it
packs
a
punch
though
not
like
the
beer
called
donkey
punch
that
i
had
a
few
years
back
at
charlotte
octoberfest
i
am
confounded
by
the
style
category
this
was
given
it
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
at
all
with
the
characteristics
listed
for
a
strong
pale
ale
or
at
least
my
idea
of
a
pale
ale
seems
more
of
a
dark
ale
or
dubbel
but
i
dont
drink
the
belgian
styles
often
so
i
am
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
give
it
a
try
it
cant
hurt
unless
you
need
the
11
to
buy
toilet
paper
in
short
overly
sweet
mediocre
brew
with
emphasis
on
esters
and
alcohol

ml
into
tulip
well
im
still
glad
i
revisited
this
but
this
is
sadly
a
product
from
a
great
brewery
that
relies
more
on
image
rather
than
genuine
drinkable
quality
id
still
drink
it
if
someone
offered
me
one
but
this
beer
could
be
so
much
more
a
disappointment
of
a
strong
pale
ale
o
really
refreshing
pretty
interesting
a
little
lacking
in
umph
though
my
daughter
schlepped
this
12
oz
over
hill
and
dale
almost
2
years
ago
and
i
am
tastingdrinking
it
now
the
nose
is
exhilerating
particularly
as
the
beer
warms
up
lots
of
toffee
the
kwak
has
malty
lager
notes
that
i
find
appealing
the
head
while
nice
at
first
didnt
stick
around
and
the
beer
is
rather
flat
looking
too
soon
theres
a
nice
deep
golden
color
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
really
good
malt
hops
and
conditioning
great
job
overall
a
nice
bold
tasting
ale
with
some
really
nice
malt
characteristics
that
you
can
only
get
from
a
really
decent
belgian
brew
o
a
really
great
beer
especially
when
looking
for
big
flavor
or
something
a
little
out
of
the
norm
o
friends
of
mine
use
to
drink
this
in
pubs
but
even
though
the
glass
is
cool
i
find
it
too
sweet
for
my
liking
on
tap
in
bottle
its
not
as
sweet
a
decent
beer
but
still
pretty
sticky
and
not
as
wellbalanced
as
other
pale
belgians
id
go
for
duvel
or
a
nice
tripel
taste
is
sugary
and
yeasty
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
its
like
melted
brown
sugar
pinch
of
cinnamon
and
clove
dust
sprinkled
on
a
piece
of
toasted
buttered
dark
bread
interesting
but
all
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
come
together
just
right
for
me
meh
not
my
favorite
belgian
offering
worth
a
shot
though
to
see
if
it
works
for
you
a
solid
beer
with
good
tastes
powerful
edge
to
it
but
for
me
other
strong
ales
are
ahead
in
my
list
but
would
get
this
again
as
its
a
loverly
tipple
drinkability
smooth
and
flavorful
this
is
very
tasty
and
very
well
crafted
stuff
the
roads
in
belgium
must
have
been
very
dangerous
with
carriage
drivers
drinking
this
on
their
routes
drink
a
nice
little
belgian
with
good
balance
and
nice
flavors
seems
a
bit
off
on
style
in
listing
probably
would
have
again
i
simply
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
especially
belgians
actually
an
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
while
nothing
about
it
makes
me
stand
up
and
take
notice
it
is
still
a
really
good
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
easy
to
like
one
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
overall
this
was
a
good
version
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
i
know
it
was
pricey
but
it
would
be
a
treat
that
would
be
me
in
a
good
mood
and
warm
me
up
in
the
winter
time
i
am
pleasantly
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
purchase
it
again
o
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
well
balanced
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
not
too
sweet
or
strong
i
would
defiantly
recommend
not
a
favorite
but
ill
keep
it
in
mind
o
another
very
good
beer
on
tap
at
the
grill
next
door
its
a
beer
you
need
to
try
out
of
the
yard
glass
they
created
for
it
its
quite
the
experience
and
a
22oz
9
alcohol
beer
will
kick
you
in
the
liver
pretty
quick
notes
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
softer
version
sometimes
of
some
belgians
that
although
not
my
favorites
are
on
a
different
league
like
a
standard
scaldis
for
instance
i
wonder
how
much
this
one
survives
by
the
smart
marketing
of
the
wooden
stand
for
the
official
glassware
because
other
than
that
and
while
relatively
decent
this
is
not
a
brew
that
i
would
carry
in
my
memory
o
if
i
hadnt
known
that
this
was
a
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
with
its
colour
and
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
flavours
its
borderline
dark
ale
i
wont
mark
it
down
for
that
because
theres
always
going
to
be
some
blurring
of
style
guidelines
which
can
sometimes
be
a
bit
too
strictly
adhered
to
leaving
that
aside
though
the
beer
itself
doesnt
really
stand
out
its
fair
to
middling
and
no
more
a
decent
enough
beer
to
try
but
not
one
that
i
might
go
back
to
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
due
to
the
high
price
its
not
one
ill
purchase
often
however
overall
this
was
fantasic
as
a
dessert
ale
shocked
from
the
low
scores
it
has
its
a
nice
session
beer
a
22oz
is
plenty
enough
the
sugary
sweetness
could
be
a
bit
much
i
wanted
this
to
be
better
than
it
is
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
is
just
too
hot
for
its
own
pants
get
an
american
pale
ale
and
a
shot
of
schnapps
and
youll
have
more
fun
was
recommended
this
beer
quite
some
time
ago
and
eventually
found
some
at
a
mom
and
pop
store
in
palermo
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
cloudy
with
some
decent
head
and
lacing
nice
malt
with
yeasty
overtones
and
prominent
alcohol
warmth
not
sessionable
but
a
decent
belgian
some
raisin
and
date
attributes
i
would
try
again
but
when
afforded
the
chance
for
some
of
the
other
belgian
heavy
hitters
and
trappistes
would
have
to
pass
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
belgian
beers
spread
quite
the
gamut
but
this
is
one
you
feel
could
have
used
a
little
more
balance
and
a
little
more
of
that
classic
belgian
yeast
character
lacks
a
lot
overall
balanced
flavors
and
very
little
bitterness
true
to
style
and
quite
good
another
nice
discovery
at
the
grill
next
door
in
haverhill
ma
this
one
shows
a
deep
and
cloudy
rusty
amber
color
with
a
fairly
scant
white
tuft
on
top
and
very
little
lacing
left
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
mild
cherry
nougat
and
mild
apple
raisin
not
very
strong
but
not
concerning
the
flavor
includes
a
mild
apple
pie
a
la
mode
sort
of
idea
theres
a
fair
touch
of
licorice
and
sweet
scone
its
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
very
fine
subtle
carbonation
it
feels
a
bit
watery
but
that
doesnt
ruin
it
the
clovespice
idea
dominates
the
fruit
introduction
as
it
works
over
your
taste
buds
but
it
finishes
weakly
with
an
odd
sweet
but
watery
licorice
summary
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
if
you
like
licorice
somewhat
unbalanced
in
your
beers
moderate
drinkability
overall
quite
good
id
have
this
again
pretty
good
pours
into
that
funky
glass
with
the
wood
frame
a
orangeamber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retains
well
bready
aroma
loaded
with
belgian
yeast
some
light
sugar
and
banana
as
well
bready
taste
light
sugar
bananas
and
apricots
toasted
malts
and
a
dry
bitter
hop
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
this
brew
was
poured
into
its
signature
glass
it
has
a
good
head
to
start
off
that
settles
into
a
white
ring
around
the
top
the
color
is
a
very
nice
amber
color
the
taste
is
a
little
spicy
and
had
a
great
caramel
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
had
enough
body
to
be
flavorful
and
pleasing
overall
this
beer
has
some
elements
of
a
belgian

i
really
enjoy
the
flavor
and
the
look
of
the
brew

o
this
feels
like
somewhere
between
a
belgian
dark
and
belgian
pale
and
it
preforms
really
well
there
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
great
o
really
nice
smooth
feeling
on
the
tongue
with
nice
flavors
and
aromas
the
first
tastes
i
detect
are
an
odd
combination
of
sharp
apple
cider
tartness
freshly
baked
wholegrain
breads
and
some
of
the
preserved
apricots
i
thought
id
detected
in
the
smell
the
acidity
of
the
brew
is
fairly
well
balanced
by
the
semisweet
graininess
the
overall
texture
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
dry
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
expected
looks
bloody
awful
in
the
glass
though
dthis
actually
goes
down
a
lot
better
than
most
belgians
i
do
love
a
good
belgian
but
i
find
most
to
be
too
heavy
to
be
drinkable
some
heavier
than
the
abv
suggests
but
not
this
one
it
stays
great
all
the
way
through
ill
be
recommending
this
to
others
just
one
more
thing
in
no
way
is
this
is
a
great
bspa
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
one
at
all
instead
i
think
if
youre
in
to
dubbels
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
im
actually
surprised
it
isnt
listed
as
one
overall
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
perhaps
my
favorite
after
orval
overall
a
suprise
but
not
a
good
one
michael
jackson
raved
about
this
one
and
i
found
it
to
be
average
to
above
average
at
best
perhaps
the
times
have
caught
up
to
this
one
or
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
slightly
above
average
but
there
are
dozens
of
belgian
beers
to
drink
before
this
one
o
keep
the
gimmicky
glassware
just
give
me
the
beer
kwak
is
sort
of
the
anatomical
skeleton
of
belgian
ales
its
conventional
unvarnished
qualities
provide
a
plain
paradigmatic
taste
of
the
style
and
a
quintessential
agreeable
learning
experience
for
young
reviewers
curious
drinkers
or
aficionados
alike
despite
being
an
ale
strippeddown
to
its
bare
essentials
its
still
an
enjoyable
social
and
perfectly
acceptable
beer
worth
drinking
or
at
least
trying
to
pour
properly
at
least
once
o
8
abv
not
that
much
of
a
factor
a
solid
good
beer
but
not
up
to
the
complexity
level
i
had
expected
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out

pauwel
kwak

and
an
excellent
2
cm

this
is
a
great
looking
beer
although
not
exactly
pale
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
a
little
sour
with
hints
of
apple
this
beer
is
lovely
and
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
there
are
some
notes
of
apple
toward
the
end
this
beer
is
thick
and
foamy
in
the
mouth
and
really
delicious
d
high
alcohol
content
means
drink
it
with
care
as
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
some
big
belgians
id
consider
it
slightly
more
drinkable
d
a
good
one
to
try
but
many
other
belgians
provide
more
complexity
and
interesting
qualities
still
glad
i
tried
it
and
may
come
back
to
it
every
once
in
awhile
d
a
fine
beer
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
this
4
5
quite
a
strong
taste
and
definitely
a
brew
to
try
though
over
the
years
this
one
has
sunk
in
my
list
from
a
personal
favourite
to
just
a
solid
good
beer
as
i
now
tend
more
towards
dubbels
and
quads
d
i
had
this
on
one
other
occasion
and
enjoyed
it
much
much
more
than
this
this
one
is
like
a
bad
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
amber
ale
a
lacking
of
almost
all
the
classic
characteristics
that
make
belgian
beer
what
it
is
its
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
percent
but
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
drinker
be
ware
of
the
air
bubble
that
shoots
more
than
a
mouthful
your
way
very
interesting
brew
right
after
serving
it
chilled
there
was
some
taste
of
medecine
and
especially
sage
a
taste
i
particularly
dislike
but
once
it
warmed
up
to
around
12c
or
54f
the
spicy
tastes
become
more
integrated
making
the
beer
rather
pleasant
as
it
is
full
bodied
with
strong
taste
it
would
make
a
great
food
compagnion
shanghai
and
peking
cuisine
would
be
suited
particularly
by
it
funny
enough
its
reputation
comes
from
wagoners
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
alcohol
and
a
nutty
note
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
was
not
aweinspiring
in
any
way
i
know
that
some
people
swear
by
this
beer
but
i
just
dont
see
it
sure
it
is
an
okay
brew
but
there
really
isnt
any
complexity
or
depth
to
it
in
my
opinion
i
would
probably
buy
this
just
to
get
the
kwak
glass
but
that
is
about
it
d
the
drinkability
is
not
that
high
even
for
a
belgian
ale
the
alcohol
hints
and
the
intense
sweetness
make
this
beer
a
sipper
at
max
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
the
waiter
at
waterzooi
with
my
mussels
he
picked
this
one
our
for
me
given
what
i
was
eating
and
though
it
would
go
well
which
it
undoubtedly
did
it
was
served
in
small
yard
style
glass
in
a
wooden
holder
very
crisp
almost
grassy
aromas
reminiscent
of
hayfields
or
being
out
somewhere
on
a
meadow
taste
was
fresh
and
somewhat
bitter
with
some
subtle
tartness
in
the
back
of
the
sip
the
beer
has
strength
but
you
cant
really
tell
when
eating
goes
great
with
food
especially
with
mussels
in
a
creamy
bacon
sauce
i
have
to
say
the
experience
was
great
and
this
beer
added
to
it
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
much
flavor
was
up
front
stronger
brews
can
tend
to
save
all
of
their
punch
for
the
very
last
drop
with
an
explosion
of
flavoring
and
alcohol
at
the
back
here
however
everything
robust
about
it
is
laid
out
in
the
start
of
the
sip
which
is
certainly
interesting
although
we
were
not
able
to
enjoy
this
brew
out
of
its
traditional
glass
it
provided
a
fine
tasting
but
was
a
bit
cumbersome
decent
drink
but
the
sweetness
is
pretty
unusual
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
not
one
id
drink
all
the
time
but
very
nice
when
in
the
mood
for
alcoholic
caramel
slightly
warming
with
a
somewhat
sharp
effervescence
bite
at
the
front
mellows
nicely
leaving
a
malty
spicy
grape
aftertaste
mediumfull
body
a
decent
brew
but
not
great
very
nice
blend
of
fruits
malts
yeasts
some
hops
and
a
big
alcohol
kick
kept
this
brew
interesting
and
enjoyable
d
this
beer
lacks
complexity
but
if
you
like
black
licorice
and
an
alcoholic
sting
in
the
back
of
your
throat
whilst
a
cold
is
on
kwak
does
the
job
nicely
d
this
was
an
average
beer
at
best
for
the
style
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
anytime
soon
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
in
the
special
glass
though
d
id
order
again
i
think
it
was
only
6
during
happy
hour
so
it
was
worth
it
to
me
fruitiness
is
strong
on
the
tongue
red
apple
dried

theres
a
caramelized
malt
backbone
along
with
a
light
spiciness
the
body
is
medium
though
the
beer
feels
overly
sweet
halfway
through
the
glass
the
finish
is
semidry
bready
a
bit
peppery
d
i
dont
really
care
for
kwak
but
i
picked
these
up
on
discount
and
wondered
what
would
happen
now
i
know
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
and
will
drink
when
i
want
something
special
but
not
too
heavy
d
this
beer
is
a
lot
different
then
anything
ive
ever
had
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
its
not
because
of
the
high
abv
i
enjoyed
that
the
taste
is
just
too
sweet
its
almost
a
chore
to
finish

abv
is

could
have

but
not
more
uncomplex
but
decent
glad
ive
tried
this
but
would
not
seek
it
out
one
that
changes
in
the
glass
a
bit
and
has
great
elements
to
it
decent
balance
hidden
alcohol
levels
but
one
you
cant
go
too
fast
or
too
slow
through
anytime
you
can
put
big
sips
down
of
an
8
brew
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
well
made
it
lacks
some
refinement
and
in
the
end
you
finish
it
because
it
is
in
your
glass
and
not
because
you
want
it
rather
different
from
what
i
expected
tasty
but
not
particularly
inspiring
but
there
is
a
certain
rusticness
that
is
growing
on
me
a
good
not
great
beer
theres
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
its
hitting
the
spot
after
dinner
id
drink
it
again
for
the
right
price
this
beer
pours
with
minimal
head
which
dissipates
pretty
quickly
the
color
is
good
copper
this
beer
smells
of
bananas
caramel
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
beer
is
sweet
with
the
same
banana
caramel
and
vanilla
and
a
little
bit
of
booze
in
the
aftertaste
it
really
does
have
a
good
mouthfeel
and
average
drinkability
a
complex
and
powerful
ale
with
a
pronounced
and
artfully
balanced
malt
character
a
bit
too
heavy
for
session
drinking
worth
imbibing
to
experience
the
authentic
glassware
system
pairs
well
with
salty
pommes
frites
and
dipping
mayo
d
not
my
favorite
a
little
raw
and
complex
easy
to
get
your
fill
after
a
few
ounces
after
that
you
get
sick
of
it
pretty
quick
d
cloying
sweetness
kills
the
beer
a
big
and
heftyseeming
version
of
the
style
especially
for
the
pale
variety
and
an
uncomplicated
boozy
fruit
bomb
at
times
the
california
cabernet
of
belgian
strong
ales
one
sans
overt
skin
extraction
anyways
a
tasty
somewhat
offkilter
brew
where
i
cant
help
but
be
reminded
of
having
just
watched
the
three
sheets
episode
where
zane
expounds
on
the
virtue
of
the
marriage
of
alcohol
and
sugar
poured
a
huge
head
and
looked
quite
attractive
with
sort
of
a
peach
tea
appearance
taste
was
very
mild
and
a
little
sweet
with
creamy
malt
mouthfeel
was
above
average
personally
i
thought
this
was
decent
in
most
categories
but
with
the
sole
exception
that
it
just
didnt
have
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
still
a
quality
brew
d
maybe
one
of
the
worst
belgians
ive
ever
had
too
much
alcohol
too
little
taste
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
other
belgians
in
terms
of
flavor
and
whats
with
the
bizarro
glass
dare
i
say
marketing
ploy
drinkability
a
little
too
intense
and
not
quite
balanced
enough
to
rate
high
in
drinkability
taste
bit
of
alcohol
unidentifiable
fruitiness
and
sugar
a
much
more
simple
beer
than
i
was
expecting
jd
not
really
sessionable
i
feel
due
to
its
weight
in
alcohol
and
overall
feel
a
onceinawhile
treat
after
a
meal
or
perhaps
before
one
of
a
kind
pauwel
kwak
wasnt
created
to
compete
with
a
modern
hyper
hopped
craft
beer
so
it
shouldnt
be
judged
against
them
im
still
fond
of
it
to
a
degree
and
it
is
still
much
better
than
just
decent
i
like
it
but
for
the
price
i
think
there
are
better
beers
out
there
so
definitely
good
but
i
only
need
one
every
5
years
or
so
to
remind
me
that
i
like
beers
that
are
bigger
on
flavor
pours
a
hazy
copper
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
fruitiness
and
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
fruity
a
sweeter
malt
and
a
small
roast
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruity
aftertaste
nice
small
fruitiness
and
easy
to
drink
i
recall
this
beer
being
much
much
better
on
tap
but
that
may
just
be
the
ceremony
of
the
pouring
and
the
ridiculitude
of
the
kwak
glass
o
good
drinkability
very
belgian
ale
recommended
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
is
far
from
the
best
belgium
around
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
more
note
this
bottle
listed
at
8
4
abv
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
interesting
and
complex
but
still
low
enough
on
alcohol
and
body
that
you
could
drink
several
d
not
bad
but
nothing
extremely
special
quite
enjoyable
ontap
from
a
fresh
keg
but
i
cant
comment
on
the
bottled
offering
cheers
d
all
good
flavors
would
seek
this
out
to
try
in
the
cool
belgium
glass
but
a
very
good
overall
brew
not
a
great
beer
and
i
dont
know
why
people
fawn
for
it
must
be
the
stupid
proprietary
glass
d
excellent
it
would
definitely
be
very
easy
to
knock
back
several
of
these
and
it
wouldnt
be
a
problem
until
you
try
to
stand
up
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
drank
several
months
following
the
best
after
date
which
might
have
contributed
to
the
slightly
low
carbonation
and
thin
mouthfeel
though
aging
should
have
been
fine
given
the
higher
abv
mildly
sweet
malt
profile
with
a
hint
of
caramel
cinnamon
and
banana
not
too
much
presence
on

actually
pretty
drinkable
but
mostly
because
there
are
no
strong
flavors
to
offend
the
palate
the
sweetness
does
start
to
get
to
you
as
you
get
on
with
the
bottle
getting
harder
to
drink
overall
this
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
it
is
pretty
decent
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
yeast
flavors
so
the
lack
thereof
is
a
bit
of
a
plus
for
me
good
creamy
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
with
not
as
dry
finish
as
its
taste
suggests
d
the
beer
is
drinkable
enough
i
suppose
itll
definitely
make
you
look
like
a
badass
while
youre
drinking
it
its
worth
it
once
if
only
for
the
presentation
not
bad
just
not
great
md
so
sweet
that
i
initally
gagged
on
the
first
sips
but
becomes
more
drinkable
when
warming
up
drinkability
kwak
is
ok
for
the
style
it
is
very
dry
i
could
not
finish
more
than
one
glass
in
a
sitting
worth
a
try
but
i
think
there
are
better
in
the
style
disappointing
on
second
thoughts
its
substantially
worse
than
coopers
vintage
especially
for
the
price
drinkability
this
beer
to
me
had
a
very
high
drinkability
it
excelled
at
having
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
and
would
actually
reach
and
hit
well
for
a
lot
of
people
who
enjoy
more
hoppy
american
style
strong
ales
then
the
typical
belgian
beer
a
beer
i
could
easily
see
my
self
downing
a
few
of
in
a
night
a
nice
beer
even
though
a
surprise
d
doesnt
hide
enough
of
the
alcohol
for
me
and
overcompensates
with
sweetness
75cl
is
probably
more
than
i
will
ever
need
of
this
one
d
a
great
belgian
brew
that
is
much
classier
than
their
gimmicky
glasswear
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
good
drinkability
but
they
definitely
catch
up
to
you
quickly
dark
cloudy
amber
or
dark
brown
pour
has
a
sizable
white
head
that
sticks
and
laces
the
glass
definitely
not
as
pale
as
some
other
belgians
in
this
category
aroma
is
light
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
nice
does
of
hops
sort
of
a
stronger
version
of
leffe
taste
is
like
light
caramel
very
clean
and
nonboozy
alcohol
doesnt
show
in
the
taste
but
you
can
tell
this
is
a
strong
brew
this
semisweet
brew
is
a
must
for
any
belgian
lover
taste
is
smooth
and
dry
sweet
fruit
bread
dough
some
caramel
and
roasted
malt
ends
with
a
oily
mouthfeel
d
easy
to
drink
nice
try
if
you
find
it
tho
not
worth
searching
for
it
in
terms
of
appearance
it
starts
off
well
but
a
lack
of
lacing
prevents
it
from
earning
any
further
points
smell
is
great
as
is
the
taste
highly
recommended
dont
worry
about
the
gimicky
glass
its
still
a
damn
good
beer

reps
from
brouwerij
bosteels
as
well
as
their
us
distributor
had
an
impromptu
tasting
if
i
understood
right
just
because
they
were
in
town
presented
in
the
proper
glassware
to
boot
with
a
slightly
cloudy
light
brown
brew
with
a
light
white
head
which
left
nice
lacing
smelled
lightly
of
apple
cider
and
caramel
malt
tasted
very
much
of
green
apples
semi
sweet
keep
thinking
cider
on
this
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
so
very
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
hidden
who
knows
where
could
be
dangerous
the
8
4
abv
sneeks
up
on
you
the
sweetness
and
lightness
of
the
body
lull
you
into
a
false
sence
of
security
and
just
as
you
finish
the
beer
to
ask
for
another
you
realise
the
room
isnt
in
focus
as
much
as
it
was
before
you
started
drinking
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
flavourite
of
my
wife
and
daughter
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
some
carbonation
tingling
nice
easy
sipper
here
this
one
is
recommended
for
sure
the
beer
is
solid
and
good
very
sweet
probably
best
after
food
with
a
ripe
cheese
i
would
buy
this
againnot
sure
if
i
missed
much
not
tasting
it
in
its
official
glass
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
pretty
sweet
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
low
in
mouth
good
finish
with
a
slight
grainy
bitterness
at
the
end
drinkability
high
some
alcohol
in
the
mouth
overall
really
good
comes
in
a
bottle
thats
heavy
enough
to
kill
when
swung
properly
and
corked
tighter
than
anything
ive
ever
encountered
had
to
struggle
mightily
with
this
one
cloudy
icedtea
in
color
with
a
manillafoldercolored
head
which
disappeared
quickly
aroma
was
rather
weak
but
i
could
still
find
some
pears
and
apricots
hiding
in
there
plus
a
strong
belt
of
honey
and
some
graham
crackers
plain
not
cinnamon
and
not
that
cheap
crap
from
trader
joes
either
very
smooth
body
with
just
a
little
thickness
to
provide
some
resistance
low
carbonation
as
expected
quite
balanced
in
the
taste
pumpernickel
bread
cherries
and
apricots
more
honey
and
a
fistful
of
carmel
malt
nothing
was
terribly
overpowering
yet
i
could
taste
everything
distinctly
low
hop
content
and
relatively
high
abv
makes
this
a
nice
thing
to
sip
slowly
while
watching
a
bogart
movie
which
is
what
my
wife
and
i
did
well
worth
the
expense
and
the
uncorking
effort
d
this
8
abv
belgian
pale
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
as
far
as
they
go
its
a
decent
strong
ale
flavoring
and
color
seem
a
bit
off
to
me
but
the
overall
product
is
a
pretty
balanced
fruity
belgian
ale
its
alright
d
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
its
better
to
sip
this
one
and
enjoy
it
underrated
in
my
opinion
i
wonder
if
the
gimicky
glass
p
o
s
some
folks
so
they
ding
the
beer
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
our
local
belgian
beer
joint
in
that
gimicky
glass
it
tastes
no
different
in
a
tulip
glass
frankly
i
followed
this
up
with
a
still
legal
duvel
here
in
pa
and
heretically
the
kwak
was
better
just
seemed
to
have
more
body
and
flavor
the
etoh
is
a
little
noticable
but
not
overbearing
or
maybe
it
was
the
glass
md
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
there
is
a
thickness
of
alcohol
that
doesnt
burn
but
the
mouthfeel
is
boozy
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
wont
feel
odd
about
ordering
a
kwak
again
drinkability
a
very
tasty
beer
but
a
bit
of
an
oddity
as
it
really
doesnt
fit
the
style
as
listed
still
a
beer
i
would
reccommend
to
fans
of
abbey
style
beer
and
barleywines
this
beer
also
seems
to
be
much
better
on
tap
and
fresh
drinkability
truth
be
known
i
just
bought
this
set
for
the
glass
plus
its
belgian
so
how
could
i
go
wrong
well
this
beer
is
not
the
best
example
of
what
the
belgians
have
to
offer
try
something
different
and
then
come
around
to
this
one
to
see
if
its
something
you
like
in
fact
take
the
three
remaining
bottles
off
of
my
hand
i
wouldnt
mind
one
bit
but
the
cool
miniyard
glass
and
stand
stays
with
me
d
wholly
uneventful
but
still
quite
pleasant
i
wouldnt
shell
out
for
another
but
i
didnt
mind
getting
this
as
a
gift
d
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
to
me
it
tastes
like
sugar
water
i
dont
understand
this
one
at
all
not
recommended
to
anyone
unless
you
like
macro
lagers
with
sugar
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
it
and
wont
have
it
again

feel
overall
a

but
nothing
special
good
but
a
bit
sweet
and
way
too
heavy
on
the
booze
d
takes
some
getting
used
to
not
like
other
belgians
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
d
try
it
once
for
the
glass
but
dont
expect
more
than
an
average
amber
from
a
slightly
sweet
nose
and
sweet
maltiness
that
inevitably
recalls
the
nougat
beer
tastes
quite
light
and
although
the
supply
of
malt
flavors
of
caramel
pleasant
the
body
is
still
quite
flat
the
finish
is
slightly
spicy
and
alcoholic
and
even
a
bit
earthy
good
beer
far
from
being
exceptional
but
whose
reputation
is
almost
mythical
drink
based
solely
on
the
container
that
is
to
say
the
glass
bracket
extremely
charismatic
hosts
kwak
much
more
than
beer
in
it
itself
hadnt
had
this
for
a
while
and
i
thought
the
reviews
on
here
seemed
a
little
harsh
but
unfortunately
im
finding
myself
agreeing
with
most
of
them
a
little
lacking
in
depth
compared
to
other
belgian
strong
ales
very
malt
and
alcohol
heavy
with
nothing
too
remarkable
to
intice
you
to
come
back
for
more
decent
but
i
wont
be
hurrying
back
surprisingly
hop
forward
with
some
subtle
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
which
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
slight
nut
character
and
subtle
dark
fruit
notes
possibly
some
raisin
and
fig
notes
very
well
balanced
and
the
bitterness
up
front
actually
lingers
throughout
into
a
slightly
dry
sweet
finish
abv
decently
masked
making
kwak
pretty
quaffable
d
the
bitter
sour
finish
is
a
little
offputting
for
me
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
i
like
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
if
youre
looking
to
try
it
go
for
the
330ml
bottle
also
take
it
easy
with
this
one
deceptively
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
really
unique
and
complex
beer
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
before
drinking
it
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
theres
a
lot
of
character
and
complexity
in
this
brew
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
bottom
line
not
as
good
as
the
tripel
but
still
try
it
in
the
end
id
pass
on
popping
hard
earned
money
on
this
stay
local
and
stay
fresh
drinkability
is
good
and
i
must
say
that
i
would
lean
toward
putting
this
one
in
the
belgian
strong
dark
category
as
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
lean
that
way
even
if
the
color
is
not
quite
to
that
standard
perhaps
if
i
had
a
kwak
glass
to
drink
out
of
it
would
have
been
a
little
more
fun
but
this
beer
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
im
not
saying
its
offensive
i
was
just
expecting
a
little
more
doubtful
ill
buy
one
again
unless
the
price
is
cut
in
half
decent
brew
though
cheers
d
if
my
wallet
would
allow
i
would
probably
love
another
couple
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
on
its
own
ill
take
what
i
can
get
this
is
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
i
dont
think
it
is
world
class
but
it
is
an
easy
drinker
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
glass
collection
and
in
my
beer
collection
what
else
can
i
say
yummm
this
has
been
a
pleasantly
consistent
beer
for
me
never
anything
aggressive
or
overwhelming
but
always
enjoyable
clean
and
possessing
a
nice
balance
of
character
drank
the
beer
in
the
original
glass
the
kwak
has
a
nice
amberlike
colour
with
a
nice
and
firm
head
smelling
strong
caramel
its
not
my
kind
of
beer
but
what
the
he
there
is
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
though
the
appearance
is
good
the
rest
is
waste
of
time
drinkability
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
after
my
evening
meal
i
am
not
looking
for
anything
complex
or
a
beer
to
wake
up
my
mouth
this
beer
gives
a
nice
initial
burst
of
flavor
then
fades
in
the
middle
and
finish
perfect
for
a
late
evening
slow
sipping
night
cap
enjoy
d
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
alcohol
needs
to
be
tamed
more
depth
in
the
flavours
is
necessary
but
otherwise
not
too
bad
medium

maybe
leaning
more
towards
light
with
a
nice

with
a
more

adequate
amount

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
had
it
before
and
remember
not
being
that
impressed
i
dunno
if
it
was
the
glassware
the
fact
it
was
ontap
my
mood
andor
the
environment
or
a
mixture
of
all
variables
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
this

grow
on
me
and
is
much
better

alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
its
a
decent
belgian
beer
although
i
stuggle
to
label
it
its
definetely
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
though
if
anything
it
trades
closer
to
a
dubbel
not
a
terrible
belgian
pale
ale
if
youre
into
that
style
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
define
by
the
malty
flavour
along
with
a
reasonable
bitterness
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
brew
the
drinkability
is
not
that
high
it
is
in
some
ways
reminiscient
of
a
trappist
beer
although
not
as
good
drinkability
sure
nice
and
complex
with
a
lot
of
pretty
unique
traits
but
a
lot
of
small
factors
are
missing
to
those
traits
which
all
together
simply
end
up
leaving
this
one
standing
at
the
finish
line
of
the
superb
brew
marathon
to
clarify
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
belgian
strong

malty

i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
during
a
trip
to
belgium
with
my
son
since
then
i
have
bought
the
unique
glass
set
and
tried
the
prestige
as
well
as
repeatedly
sampled
the
strong
pale
ale
i
have
pleasant
memories
of
this
beer
and
find
its
history
intriguing
the
combination
makes
it
a
joy
to
experience
a
complex
but
the
glass
is
cooler
than
the

finish

crisp

lingers
but
not
as
long
as
most
belgians
the
body
is
quite
thick
and
rich
this
is
definitely
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
not
better
on
the
nose
it
shows
primarily
roasted
grains
and
only
in
the
background
are
impressions
of
sour
yeast
and
fruit
on
the
palate
it
is
ably
balanced
between
broad
malty
cereal
flavors
and
unobtrusive
botanical
bitterness
all
of
this
occurs
in
a
creamy
medium
of
fine
mousse
only
just
offset
by
tangy
fruit
and
grip
on
the
finish
because
of
its
clean
roasty
profile
this
is
a
perfect
belgian
beer
for
any
ba
lost
in
an
anglo
paradigm
and
wanting
to
dip
their
toes
into
the
exotic
continental
waters
of
beer

this
beer
was
something
of
a
contradiction
in
terms
there
was
a
great
deal
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
profile
yet
it
had
all
the
grace
of
a
rhino
crashing
through
the
jungle
poured
a
hazy
coppery
brown
flavor
was
very
oaky
as
though
it
had
been
aged
in
an
oak
cask
with
a
heavyhanded
tannin
aspect
alcohol
flavor
was
distinct
and
not
integrated
i
had
to
work
at
enjoying
this
beer
and
in
the
end
decided
it
was
not
worth
the
effort
oh
and
about
the
ducks
comment
sorry
for
the
wise
kwak
p
overall
this
is
worth
trying
tasty
but
not
one
of
the
greatest
beers
on
earth
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
i
dont
think
id
pay
the
i
paid
for
this
one
again
it
is
almost
too
easy
drinking
for
what
i
consider
a
sipping
style
beer
lacks
a
little
depth
still
not
bad
though

a
golden

quickly

a

notes

carmel

finish
some
warming

the

and
slight

mouthfeel

all

much

this
one
pours
a

orangeamber
colour
with
an
enormous
head
the
head
releases
fruity
aromas
that
include
banana
tart
apple
tropical
fruits
ie
starfruit
the
taste
is
similar
in
many
ways
all
the
fruity
taste
with
a
really
cool
light
ciderbanana
thing
going
on
this
seems
to
be
the
thing
with
the

like

pour
was
a

i
thought
the
aroma
was
like

carbonation
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
lot
of
yeastiness
going
on

its
very
good
and
very
smooth

with
that
abv
it
was
easy

again

a
hazed
tea
color
with
very
little
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
the
smell
is
very
nice
revealing
light
fruit
and
a
hint
spices
with
a
small
trace
of
warming
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
heavy
malt
watery
sweet
fruit
and
very
faint
spicing
the
alcohol
is
fairly
hidden
in
taste
with
the
malt
that
starts
out
in
the
beginning
this
is
surprisingly
a
light
bodied
brew
despite
the
rush
of
malt
at
the
start
of
each
taste
and
it
finishes
lightly
sweet

overall
a

just
nothing
really
exceptional
drinkable
enough
that
you
want
one
when
youre
in
the
mood
but
not
a
beer
im
gonna
settle
in
to
for
long
too
simple
in
a
onesided
way
and
in
that
respect
when
compared
to
so
many
other
belgians
this
beer
is
pretty
weak
overall
drinkability
it
took
me
a
while
to
drink
this
because
you
dont
want
to
swig
big
gulps
of
the
tangy
sour
taste
but
i
could
have
had
another
couple
if
i
planned
on
taking
it
easy
and
drinking
slowly

gotta
mention
the

the

a

all
good

and

goddamn
cavity
creeps
its

this
many

and
the

not
the

corked
and
caged
version
im
convinced
this
versions
better
than
the
draught
version
or
the
small
bottle
absolutely
hit
the
spot
this
beer
poured
a
clear
reddishamber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
the
smell
was
modest
sweet
with
traces
of
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
fruitiness
musty
grapes
the
taste
was
sweet
up
front
with
some
vinous
grape
flavors
and
some
tangy
maltiness
there
was
a
slightly
musty
flavor
in
the
finish
and
the
flavors
really
lingered
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
some
sweetness
but
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
feel
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
the
was
a
rather
nice
belgian
ale
the
light
amber
brew
arrived
at
the
table
with
a
low
but
persistent
head
which
lasted
until
the
end
the
arom
was
fruity
with
a
sweet
candy
aroma
also
present
was
caramel
the
flavor
was
crisp
and
contained
pepper
and
a
slight
bubblegum
the
sweet
candy
flavor
lasted
into
the
dry
finish
after
sipping
you
are
left
with
an
acoholic
warmth
from
the
beer
the
taste
was
quite
dark
for
a
pale
ale
almost
more
like
a
bock
than
a
belgian
beer
a
malty
breadlike
taste
with
hints
of
raisins
a
peppery
slightly
bitter
lingering
finish
quite
unexpected
and
not
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
imho
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
wellbalanced
characteristics
the
character
changes
noticeably
with
warming
more
complexity
develops
nevertheless

has

this
beers
sweetness
sets
it

in

caramel
coriander
a

define
kwak
mildly
carbonated
and
especially
smooth
on
draught
this
beer
can
turn
syrupy
or
oily
as
it
warms
a
nice
sipper
but
its
sweetness
and
alcohol
content
keeps
it
from
being
overly
drinkable
a
fine
belgian
in
the
bottle
i
find
the
draft
version

its
a

but
there
are
some
earthy
and
musty
aspects
to
this
beer
as
well
the

alcohol
is
somewhat
evident
in
the
slight

to
the
flavor
and
a
touch
of

in
the

with

taste
is
quite
fruity
with
a
lot
of
spices
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
what
the
other
reviews
have
indicated
no
its
not
the
best
that
belgium
has
to
offer
but
its
still
a
treat
to
try
this
drinkability

sorry
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
went
down
painfully
slow
a
sweet
lightly
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
mandarin
orange
yeast
and
sugar
the
beer
pours
light
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
head
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
rawsugar
maltiness
yielding
to
flavors
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
lightly
spicy
hop
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable

seems
to
go
down
better
the
more
of
it
you
drink
i
only
wish
itd
been
served
in
the
special
glass
rich
rosey
amber
color
with
a
substantial
head
bubbles
form
uneavenly
and
foam
laces
the
glass
smell
is
arousing
earthen
and
malty
taste
is
equally
malty
sweet
filling
and
warm
finish
is
clean

of
white
grape
now
im
ready
for
dinner
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
a
small
tan
creamy
sized
head
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
carbonated
with
a
dense
appearance
the
hue
was
amber
and
the
nose
consisted
of
alcohol
sweet
and
fruity
there
was
not
much
lacing
with
this
beer
the
flavor
was
definitely
that
of
alcohol
and
it
was
somewhat
bitter
tasting
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
on
my
tongue
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
one
was
a
bit
difficult
to
get
down
due
to
the
alcohol
taste
the
taste
gave
away
to
that
sweet
malty
flavour
with
a
hnit
of
spicy
flavour
the
alco
level
is
definately
apparent
on
this
beer
and
gives
the
beer
a
real
warming
feeling
as
you
drink
it
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
fallwinter
beer
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beers
when
its
the
middle
of
summer
and
30
degrees
86
f
outside
after
hearing
about
the
uniqueness
of
kwak
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
and
i
enjoyed
it
although
this
seems
like
it
was
more
of
a
wintery
beer
than
a
summer
one
i
still
liked
it
nonetheless
and
maybe
ill
have
another
this
holiday
season
lovely
presentation
in
the
hourglass
shaped
glassware
held
in
a
wooden
stand
comes
out
dark
reddish
gold
under
a
firm
tan
head
that
leaves
lovely
lace
the
nose
is
mild
but
distinctly
hoppy
with
flowery
undertones
the
mouth
is
lightly
carbonated
and
well
balanced
the
initial
taste
has
a
touch
of
malt
but
is
dominated
by
the
hops
this
leads
to
a
nice
flowery
hoppy
finish
and
an
excellent
smooth
bitter
aftertaste
i
liked
it
pours
a
nice
redcopper
color
with
meium
head
that
leaves
some
great
lacingthe
aroma
is
almost
non
existant
with
a
slight
powdered
sugar
smell
the
tast
is
pretty
complex
malty
sweet
with
a
tast
of
candied
sugar
as
the
backbone
alcihol
is
prevalent
in
the
finish
wich
is
nice
and
warming
a
real
nice
malty
beervery
impressed
ive
always
enjoyed
kwak
and
while
some
speak
of
it
being
overrated
i
would
argue
the
opposite
a
very
tasty
malty
ale
creamier
than
most
other
belgian
ales
pours
a
large
foamy
head
with
very
sticky
and
prominent
lacing
brownish
hue
definitely
balanced
towards
the
malts
and
quite
sweet
despite
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
ale
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
not
up
there
with
the
absolute
greats
but
certainly
on
a
par
with
corsendonk
chimay
red
maudite
and
several
other
excellent
belgian
and
belgianstyled
brown
ales
and
dubbels
all
in
all
a
good
beer
however
for
the
style
it
is
mediocre
i
usually
dont
drink
mediocre
beers
more
than
once
but
i
can
see
another
kwak
in
my
future
however
given
the
choice
of
kwak
versus
any
number
of
other
belgians
kwak
will
probably
lose
out
smooth
rich
dark
brown
with
caramel
malty
overtones
alcohol
welll
noted
throughout
this
bottle
with
a
malty
blance
that
is
rich
and
full
bodied
and
not
too
sweet
more
like
an
abbey
dubbel
in
alcohol
and
color
fruity
delicious
and
worth
every
penny
highly
drinkable
but
dangerous
very
little
head
when
pourred
into
glass
almost
no
bubble
coming
from
the
bottom
the
alcohol
is
way
too
evident
and
takes
too
much
place
leaving
little
for
the
spice
taste
to
come
throught
a
little
bit
disapointed
i
was
hoping
more
from
this
belgian
ale
which
is
usually
highly
rated
by
beer
drinkers
being
a
belgian
beer
i
made
sure
to
quit
pouring
it
when
i
saw
floating
particles
try
and
enter
my
glass
poured
with
a
very
thin
head
which
dissipated
quickly
color
was
a
deep
amber
but
not
to
the
point
of
redness
aroma
was
a
sweetness
punctuated
by
a
few
esters
but
not
very
much
taste
was
very
thin
with
sweetness
and
a
slight
hoppiness
and
again
few
esters
carmelly
yet
dry
due
to
esters
but
with
a
bitter
hoppiness
with
a
very
clean
finish
overall
i
would
rather
try
a
different
belgian
beer
instead
so
i
can
find
a
brand
more
indicitave
of
the
style
this
belgian
ale
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
poor
head
for
style
i
could
best
say
that
everything
about
this
ale
was
okay
the
aroma
was
malty
and
a
little
fruity
the
taste
was
subdued
but
did
contain
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
bubbly
for
the
price
i
would
select
another
belgian
unless
you
are
trying
to
introduce
someone
to
a
belgian
not
bad
but
there
are
better
belgian
ales
out
there
pours
a
dark
amber
color
that
almost
shows
a
reddish
hue
from
certain
angles
topped
by
a
rather
thin
off
white
head
that
maintains
a
thin
collar
around
the
glass
sweet
roasted
notes
accented
by
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
aroma
has
the
distinct
belgian
dubbel
sort
of
smell
the
taste
is
interesting
and
sort
of
complex
immediately
a
very
earthy
malt
flavor
comes
through
then
some
woodiness
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
this
one
as
well
then
the
alcohol
sweetness
hits
you
theres
a
touch
of
bittering
on
the
finish
and
perhaps
even
a
slight
astringency
to
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
but
yet
smooth
carbonation
is
there
but
barely
noticeable
as
it
meshes
well
with
the
mouthfeel
this
is
not
what
i
expected
as
something
more
like
a
leffe
blonde
was
in
my
mind
i
seem
to
remember
being
more
surprised
and
enamored
by
the
aroma
and
the
sweetness
of
the
leffe
but
i
enjoyed
this
as
well
hopefully
the
rating
reflects
that
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
its
even
better
that
i
picked
up
for
a
song
at
a
wine
shop
in
ohio
if
the
alcohol
were
more
subtle
id
like
it
much
more
pours
an
amber
colour
topped
by
a
creamy
head
this
beer
looks
beautifull
especially
the
glass
adds
to
the
appearance
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malts
fruits
taste
is
very
sweet
pauwel
kwak
has
a
sweetness
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
tasted
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
then
dont
even
bother
trying
this
one
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
into
sweet
beers
then
you
wouldnt
mind
drinking
kwak
all
day
long
just
have
in
mind
the
abv
dont
let
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
fool
you
its
a
very
strong
beer
an
excellent
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
my
favourite
sweetfloralfruit
smell
upon
first
wiff
very
carbonated
pink
look
with
a
slight
white
lace
no
real
lasting
head
to
speak
of
sweet
yeasty
taste
with
some
dry
fruit
green
grapes
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
there
is
also
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
upfront
the
taste
is
sweet
but
that
weakens
as
you
swallow
nice
soft
mouth
a
little
too
sweet
and
light
tasting
on
the
back
end
this
weak
lilt
hurt
its
drinkability
for
me
the
smell
is
faint
its
sweet
nutty
creamy
the
front
is
spicy
and
sweet
the
middle
is
malty
a
little
fruity
with
some
toffee
creeping
in
for
a
deep
toffee
finish
alcohol
is
a
little
obvious
on
the
finish
what
an
interesting
beer
its
very
malty
almost
a
british
belgian
i
like
it
750ml
bottle
pours
a
rusty
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
that
leaves
heavy
sheets
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
nose
is
very
faint
to
start
but
starts
to
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
with
aromas
of
sweet
malt
fruity
yeasts
and
raw
sugar
medium
to
full
in
body
and
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
in
texture
taste
is
dominated
by
an
overall
sweetness
with
notes
of
candied
sugar
and
tropical
fruits
up
front
followed
by
rumsoaked
sweetened
raisins
and
a
bit
of
ice
wine
an
enjoyable
beer
but
seems
somewhat
out
of
balance
still
id
gladly
drink
this
again
as
it
does
serve
as
a
fine
nightcap
not
poured
in
the
official
glassware
however
this
beer
is
still
a
must
try
for
any
belgium
beer
lover
like
myself
anyway
you
can
get
it
this
beer
appears
a
slighlty
ruby
with
a
hint
of
brown
amber
shade
to
it
and
pours
with
a
massive
off
white
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
a
deep
buttery
malty
treat
that
spreads
joy
throughout
the
world
and
puts
an
instant
smile
on
my
face
the
taste
has
a
deep
warming
effect
going
on
through
out
my
palate
and
through
my
chest
as
i
take
each
sip
of
this
nectar
of
the
gods
with
hints
of
candied
sugar
that
it
was
primed
with
those
deep
butter
flavors
are
complemented
with
a
smooth
nutty
malt
flavor
the
last
trickle
of
flavor
provides
just
a
hint
of
some
fruit
tones
that
are
amazing
to
me
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
the
carbonation
tickles
and
soothes
the
back
of
the
throat
at
the
same
time
drinkability
in
one
word
incredible
f
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
minimal
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
contains
strong
scents
of
fruits
like
most
belgian
ales
with
a
slight
undertone
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
the
fruity
taste
is
very
apparent
but
it
is
oddly
somewhat
sour
not
too
sour
but
just
enough
to
be
different
they
do
a
good
job
of
masking
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasing
as
the
fruits
and
sweetness
is
very
clear
drinkability
is
not
so
good
on
this
one
because
it
is
so
sweet
and
sour
that
i
cant
see
myself
enjoying
more
than
one
overall
a
very
good
belgian
beer
that
i
enjoyed
profusely
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
tried
even
by
belgian
standards
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
beer
from
a
country
that
i
believe
produces
too
many
beers
with
an
overwhelmingly
similar
flavor
profile
cheers
to
bosteels
for
doing
something
different

slight

feel
is
all
sweet

smooth

thats
like
a

surprising
kick
for

pleasantly
smooth
character
note
ive
tried
both
the
33cl
bottle
and
the
75cl
the
33cl
is
not
bottleconditioned
so
it
tastes
a
bit
tamer
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
vapid
the
75
can
be
a
real
treat
though
this
beer
is
pretty
clear
it
has
a
glowing
presence
about
it
and
is
very
orange
in
color
maybe
some
scarlet
hues
in
the
mix
as
well
aroma
is
sweet
like
candy
musty
a
little
fruity
pears
and
woody
the
subtelty
of
this
beer
knocks
me
on
my
ass
if
that
makes
sense
it
always
poses
somewhat
of
a
problem
for
me
as
picking
out
the
flavors
and
complexities
in
a
subtle
beer
is
always
more
difficult
i
get
some
definite
pear
flavors
apple
cider
as
well
seems
fairly
high
in
acidity
fruity
esters
and
bubblegum
esters
dance
about
way
in
the
background
here
and
there
dry
finish
is
perceived
nice
little
beverage
here
not
as
good
as
their
tripel
karmeliet
however
very
clear
and
beautiful
amber
colored

a
few
lonely
co2
bubbles
rise
to
the

also
a

flavor
slight

moderate

brew
feels
fairly

too
flavour
is
malty

spicy
but
not
as
intense
as
youd
expect
from
the
aroma
sweetness
seems
just
right
aftertaste
is
good
but
a
bit
short
an
interesting
beer
like
so
many
belgians
sweet
malts
at
the
start
they
dry
out
as
you
would
expect
then
the
brew
is
a
bit
roasty
the
aftertaste
is
fruity
and
the
alcohol
becomes
confident
that
i
am
safe
with
the
gas
i
am
sure
glad
that
this
place
is
not
set
to
sell
as
soon
as
someone
shows
interested
in
the
product
drinkability
pretty
good
for
an
8abv
brew
while
the
flavor
overall
is
a
bit
too
bland
for
my
tastes
it
certainly
goes
down
easy
enough
still
i
like
to
be
challenged
with
assertive
brews
and
this
isnt
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
clear
dark
copper
hue
covered
by
a
thick
creamy
rutted
ivory
white
head
belgian
lace

left
the
aroma
is
an
enticing
melange
of
bright
acidic
ripe
citrus
and
pronounced
brittle
like
nuttiness
mellow
buttery
caramel
and
mildly
spicy
hops
add
additional
complexity
aromawise
as
the
beer
breathes
caramelized
malt
becomes
progressively
stronger
in
aroma
and
fruitiness
diminishes
flavorwise
this
brew
has
caramel
malt
character
far
exceeding
any
belgian
style
ive
experienced
thus
far
rounded
caramel
and
molasses
tinged
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
is
ceded
by
mildly
herbal
phenol
and
an
understated
but
perceptibly
grassy
chlorophyll
tinged
hop
flavor
quite
light
on
fermentation
byproducts
and
other
than
the
mellow
clove
a
hint
of
banana
esters
rides
parallel
with
caramel
malt
hop
bitterness
is
paltry
leaving
the
overall
balance
well
skewed
towards
sweetness
impressions
of
carob
and
oak
emerge
mid
palate
and
complement
malt
character
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
finishes
long
with
hints
of
chalk
and
fleeting
biscuit
and
banana
kwak
is
a
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
brew
its
most
akin
to
a
dubbel
in
overall
character
but
with
a
uniquely
assertive
caramel
malt
presence
kwak
gains
complexity
and
depth
as
it
warms
and
breathes

and
somewhat
dangerous

sip
had
a
noticeable
alcohol
kick
good
maltiness
that
helped
give
this
beer
some
body
spicey
and
hints
of
citrus
make
this
beer
pleasurable
but
not
outstanding
by
any
stretch
maybe
sampling
this
beer
in
its
original
yard
glass
would
have
enhanced
the
experience
nontheless
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
orangishamber
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
candi
sugar
malty
and
somewhat
fruity
alcohol
is
present
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
sweet
bready
and
malty
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
and
easily
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
belgianstyle
beers
but
i
liked
this
one
very
much
as
an
aside
my
fiancee
who
is
german
and
loves
the
great
beers
of
that
country
proclaimed
this
beer
with
its
abundant
suspended
yeast
to
be
gross
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
butter
with
very
very
little
carbonation
fruity
flavors
blend
sweetly
with
a
touch
of
mild
hops
and
warming
alcohol
towards
the
end
this
is
a
fine
ale
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
and
certainly
can
compete
with
the
best
if
youre
interested
heres
a
site
where
you
can
see
a

managed
to
take
the
last
of
the
final
keg
at
monks
when
i
was
there
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
nose
was
enticing
with
belgian
yeast
and
almost
candy
like
aromas
flavor
was
dominated
by
a
sweet
maltiness
but
also
showed
signs
of
belgian
yeast
overall
i
found
the
flavors
to
be
more
subdued
will
definitely
try
it
again
hoping
not
to
get
the
end
of
the
keg
pauwel
kwak
is
a
sentimental
favorite
or
mine
reminding
me
of
many
days
spent
at
vol
de
nuit
in
nyc
drinking
belgian
brews
and
eating
fries
and
mussels
tasting
this
beer
always
brings
me
back
the
glass
was
perfect
for
the
beer
as
it
showed
off
its
very
fruityyeasty
aroma
the
taste
was
smooth
with
strong
flavors
of
citrus
fruits
with
hints
of
bready
malts
very
nice
very
easy
to
drink
but
watch
out
for
the
kick
of
alcohol
at
the
end
on
tap
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelphia
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
mild
malt
aromas
like
dark
fruits
with
a
little
pear
thrown
in
for
good
measure
taste
is
sweet
ripe
pear
licorice
and
pepper
pleasantly
bitter
finish
locals
in
belgium
might
consider
this
a
fad
brew
but
i
liked
it
anyway
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
amber
color
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
smooth
belgian
with
a
sweet
and
clean
flavor
the
flavor
is
definitely
better
than
the
name
good
beer
you
need
the
glass
for
effect
this
pours
with
a
white
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
leaving
great
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
deep
amber
colored
beer
with
a
nose
of
sweet
and
fruity
aromas
such
as
banana
cloves
and
bubblegum
not
to
far
off
from
a
good
hefeweizen
taste
has
much
complexity
and
depth
to
it
with
some
flavors
of
banana
alcohol
and
liquoriceanise
all
sensed
little
hoppiness
to
report
finishes
up
sweet
and
quite
warming
this
beer
poured
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
a
good
amount
of
tiny
bubble
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
cinnamon
a
flavor
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
to
a
medium
body
slightly
astrigent
finish
my
most
recent
750
ml
of
kwak
was
choked
with
giant
protein
flakes
to
the
point
where
you
could
feel
them
slip
down
your
throat
hazy
deep
orangishredamber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
light
caramel
maltiness
and
shows
some
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
makes
it
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
rich
with
a
lightly
fruity
candyish
character
that
has
caramel
toffee
undertones
as
well
as
a
light
spiciness
again
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
not
distracting
it
may
in
fact
help
to
thin
the
sweetness
theres
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
thats
the
extent
of
it
kwaks
flavor
isnt
complex
but
it
is
quite
luxurious
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
should
be
lingered
over
highly
recommended
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
when
i
had
my
first
sip
after
it
was
poured
but
things
definitely
got
better
as
it
started
to
warm
up
as
it
warmed
up
the
malt
and
hops
became
more
apparent
nice
little
hop
taste
on
the
beginning
of
the
tongue
followed
by
nice
malt
and
toffee
taste
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
warming
itself
as
it
travels
down
your
throat
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
over
a
long
period
of
time
after
it
has
warmed
to
enjoy
all
its
character
quite
nice
caramelly
malt
flavours
slightly
spicy
i
liked
it
but
lacking
perhaps
a
bit
of
complexity
slightly
sweet
aswell
but
well
balanced
notes
it
is
definitely
a
strong
ale
being
that
its
alcoholic
prowess
flexes
its
muscles
right
away
a
decent
strong
ale
though
seems
to
be
a
bit
over
the
top
for
its
own
self
lacks
complexity
and
depth
and
a
bit
too
much
on
the
esterstoo
warm
of
a
fermentation
though
makes
up
with
its
drinkability
tried
this
at
a
beer
tasting
last
nightwas
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
by
apperancebut
its
decieving
nice
golden
and
slight
cloudyness
nice
nose
but
can
detect
some
phenols
great
balance
that
finishes
with
a
little
creamyness
it
was
one
of
those
beers
that
appeals
to
people
that
like
lighter
beers
and
those
that
like
strong
ones
i
thought
this
to
be
a
mediocre
brew
when
i
had
it
in
belgium
and
so
did
the
locals
most
who
drank
it
did
so
because
its
served
in
miniyard
glass
with
a
wooden
holder
more
of
a
fad
brew
the
flavor
hits
of
heavy
yeast
quality
with
some
banana
clove
and
more
spice
a
clean
quality
with
some
sweetness
hiding
the
alcohol
a
medium
plus
phenolic
quality
hits
at
the
end
as
the
beer
dries
out
wow
its
must
be
made
from
leprechaun
gold
and
unicorn
tears
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgianstyle
golden
ale
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
bspa
almost
bordering
on
a
hoppy
tripel
i
am
down
with
this
beer
mild
floral
hoppy
aroma
medium
carbonation
taste
is
a
nice
light
hop
with
a
yeasty
backbone
very
light
for
a
9
abv
beer
definitely
pick
one
up
if
you
can
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
light
yellow
pour
nice
fruity
belgian
spice
dry
light
bitter
finish
taste
is
very
complex
and
interesting
hints
of
dryness
but
with
a
silky
smooth
sweetness
and
a
surprisingly
medium
full
body
perception
alcohol
is
well
hidden
funk
is
subtle
and
adds
more
complexity
than
actual
assertive
flavors
a
joy
to
sip
on
my
only
wish
is
that
is
was
a
little
lighter
in
mouthfeel
and
more
digestible
so
this
is
my
second
stillwater
beer
this
one
was
not
as
disappointing
as
the
first
but
i
am
confused
about
the
ratings
something
off
about
the
beer
i
am
really
struggling
to
put
my
finger
on
it
to
much
bad
after
taste
sticks
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
everything
else
seems
good
but
the
off
aftertaste
kills
the
beer
for
me
i
am
thinking
that
there
is
something
in
stillwater
that
does
not
work
for
me
hope
you
enjoy
as
much
as
the

pretty

with
a

of
the
flavors
a

off

really
nice

still
getting

taste
for

this

is
most
agreeable
smooth

with
just
a

alcoholee
one
wouldnt

i
dont

overall
seriously
good
stuff
lots
of
vibrant
flavour
and
a
complex
taste
that
keep
this
beer
very
interesting
throughout
its
also
incredibly
refreshing
a

it

the

well
carbonated

the
taste
is
following

expands
with
more
herbal

resinous
hops
mixed
with
the
grassy
flavor
yet
mild
astringency
with
gentle
yeast
with
peppery
accent
and
moderately
high
carbonation
adding
to
the
yeast
tanginess
in
the
back
of

the
flavor
is
lightly
pine
oriented
with
gentle
zest
and
the
yeast
also
brings
a
vinous
element
to
mind
overall
a
very
complex
belgian
strong
pale
with
tons

hoppy
yeasty

look
for

very
good

wow
serious
brew
yet
can
just
about
drink
the
hell

it
very
true

great

excellent

though
a

rich
nice

with
good

exotic

odd
in
that
on
one
hand
it
seems

yet
its
also
got
some
extremes
a
little
boozy
too
overall
great
drinkability
and
price
for
value
true
to
style
and
rivalling
of
any
top
tier
belgian
bpas
ive
had
to
date
m
great
carb
smooth
and
crisp
finish
overall
another
beer
i
found
which
i
was
hesitant
of
the
price
but
am
very
impressed
with
i
would
go
back
and
pick
up
the
rest
of
their
beers
o
clean
and
crisp
with
balanced
sweetness
definitely
worth
trying

a
very
solid

glad
to
have
these
guys
in

olove

beers
and
think
they
do
awesome
belgian
saison
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
highly
drinkable
and
the
9
0
is
not
apparent
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
wish
everything
lined
up
more
like
the
nose
and
that
the
mouthfeel
were
a
little
better
if
it
did
then
this
would
be
one
of
the
best
available
beers
in
my
book
a
very
enjoyable
version
of
my
favorite
style
bottom
line
i
paid
2
for
a
12oz
bottle
and
am
more
than
happy
its
a
great
beer
you
should
try
it
if
you
see
it
although
id
suggest
buying
a
single
or
draft
before
going
in
on
the
4pk
if
you
arent
aware
of
stillwaters
other
beers
easily
one
of
the
best
bspas
ive
tried
oh
and
absolutely
love
the

label

i
think
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
love
the
dry
finish
and
the
light
mouthfeel
youd
never
know
this
beer
was
9
until
you
had
2
or
3
o
crisp
refreshing
a
little
hoppy
this
belgian
has
it
all
good
stuff
yet
again
from
stillwater
this
one
is
a
hazy
bright
yellow
brew
with
a
heck
of
a
nice
looking
two
inches
of
pure
white
head
but
it
fades
out
after
a
minute
or
so
the
nose
is
fruity
green
apples
and
grapes
its
wine
or
ciderlike
in
character
with
some
good
strong
belgian
yeast
the
label
says
hoppy
and
so
did
the
guy
at
the
bottle
shop
but
i
didnt
find
this
to
be
a
particularly
hoppy
brew
not
by
my
standards
anyhow
some
decent
citrus
hops
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
far
from
a
hop
forward
brew
its
driven
by
belgian
yeast
for
sure
long
apple
tasting
finish
not
sure
if
i
love
that
part
carbonation
is
good
at
first
pour
but
like
the
head
it
doesnt
hold
and
the
last
few
sips
are
nearly
flat
very
well
hidden
booze
strength
though
this
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
9
abv
probably
should
be
good
beer
all
in
all
not
stillwaters
most
challenging
brew
but
i
liked
it
for
what
it
is
this
was
a
terrific
belgian
pale
for
stillwater
overall
a
little
surprised
i
find
a
lot
of
belgian
golden
ales
are
technically
good
but
still
not
enjoyable
this
is
both
it
may
not
be
damnation
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
will
be
buying
this
again
o
wow
i
have
never
had
anything
from
still
water
before
today
and
i
can
say
as
someone
who
has
tried
their
share
of
farmhouse
beers
in
the
midwest
this
beer
really
knows
how
to
represent
that
huge
saison
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
and
something
that
is
definitely
4pack
worthy
at
the
very
least
fabulous
and
understated
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
citrus
and
pineapplelike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
yeast
and
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
i
am
not
sure
if
there
is
brett
in
this
one
but
it
does
have
a
similar
aspect
in
the
taste
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
and
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
some
really
nice
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
super
easy
to
drink
a
great
belgian
inspired
ale
from
stillwater
another
interesting
brew
from
stillwater
i
like
the
interplay
between
the
spicy
yeast
and
the
stonecitrus
fruit
hops
drinks
very
easy
for
9
and
lots
of
interesting
nuances
of
flavor
o
a
good
beer
but
less
captivating
than
i
was
hoping
i
would
not
have
again
o
intense
yet
delicate
as
follows
is
sun
in
a
glass
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
could
be
blended
better
but
the
alcohol
does
not
take
away
from
the
refined
power
of
this
beer
enjoy
it
in
sips
overall
one
recommendation
mix
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
this
beer
as
soon
as
you
get
a
chance
mixing
it
in
exponentially
improves
this
beer
i
like
what
the
brewery
is
doing
they
for
sure
have
a
style
but
if
its
not
broke
dont
fix
it
overall
very
drinkable
good
flavors
and
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
i
seldom
drink
these
if
i
want
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ill
grab
a
duvel
and
revel
in
its
lovely
irresistible
champagnelike
character
this
one
lacks
that
stony
dryness
that
i
love
so
much
and
instead
opts
for
a
fruit
and
peppery
flavor
that
im
sorry
to
say
doesnt
completely
agree
with
my
palate
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
but
i
really
appreciate
the
complexity
and
challenge
to
my
senses
that
this
beer
brings
and
it
meets
the
style
description
quite
well
so
for
that
i
give
it
high
marks
it
definitely
has
a
lot
going
for
it
and
has
me
wondering
if
i
should
explore
more
belgian
strong
pale
ales
to
see
what
else
is
out
there
the
feel
is
fluffy
and
wellcarbonated
without
being
too
filling
or
hard
crispness
runs
through
and
theres
a
certain
depth
to
the
light
body
stillwater
seems
to
have
mastered
overall
very
good
the
discrepancy
between
the
nose
and
the
flavour
is
remarkable
but
both
are
very
good
in
different
ways
the
hops
really
play
a
bigger
role
in
this
beer
than
is
typical
for
the
style
but
it
works
overall
really
enjoyable
and
unlikely
light
body
for
a
high
abv
cantaloupe
rind
and
woodyherbal
hop
bitterness
up
front
sweetish
malt
and
fruit
quickly
take
over

with
banana
and
underripe

some
sweetness
but
alongside
some
welcome
tangy
almost
tart
ness
herbal
hop
bitterness
increases
into
the
finish
belgian
yeast
all
over
this
thing
and
its
a
good
thing
a
little
peppery
spice
in
the
finish
lingering
woody

and
pear

medium

with
a
slightly

a

very
slowly
to

overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
blurred
the
line
between
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
a
farmhouse
ale
it
had
the
complexity
and
drinkability
that
i
really
look
for
in
this
style
it
was
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
want
in
this
style
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
taste
doing
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
750ml
bottle
its
a
great
summer
time
beer
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
balanced
it
was
no
aspect
was
too
overpowering
and
it
looked
very
good
from
the
bottle
to
what
was
inside
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
it
wasnt
super
expensive
at
9
99
for
750ml
but
that
would
prevent
me
from
buying
it
often
i
know
stillwater
just
started
selling
some
of
their
beer
in
12oz
four
packs
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
perfect
format
for
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
great
beer
to
cool
off
with
during
the
summer
heat
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
pale
ales
or
farmhouse
ales
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
stillwater
and
this
one
is
even
better
than
the
first
one
i
had
stillwater
is
on
my
radar
now
and
i
will
for
sure
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
their
beers
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
strong
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
so
far
good
job
guys
this
is
one
great
beer
a
pretty
enjoyable
bspa
the
fruit
and
spice
well
rendered
the
yeast
on
its
best
behaviour
not
to
mention
the
mostly
awol
alcohol
say
that
ten
times
fast
im
glad
to
finally
come
across
a
stillwater
offering
where
i
can
associate
it
directly
to
a
given
style
not
that
they
have
to
brew
that
way
at
all
but
when
i
start
to
notice
patterns
like
that
it
sort
of
hinders
overall
recognizance
ya
know
o
a
nice
drinkable
strong
ale
definitely
hides
the
alcohol
taste
o
really
good
stuff
do
fairly
light
and
refreshing
for
a
strong
ale
this
beer
is
strange
perhaps
because
of
the
way
that
is
retains
levity
in
the
face
of
what
ought
to
be
burdensome
flavor
and
texture
the
combination
of
stale
and
creamy
is
not
one
often
encountered
very
nice
has
a
great
farmhouse
quality
to
it
to
taste

with

short

that
is

and
the
soured

less
belgian
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
smell
thinnish
body
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
d
the
alcohol
stays
well
hidden
making
this
a
dangerous
beast
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
again
d
nice
balanced
bspa
good
mix
of
spices
yeast
character
and
malt
flavors
beer
is
a
little
spicy
with
a
nice
floral
character
and
an
almost
champagne
like
yeastiness
to
it
a
very
effervescent
beer
with
a
nice
finish
decent
saison
overall
a
pretty
tasty
complex
and
well
done
take
on
the
style
solid
brew
owell
balanced
and
tons
of
flavor
never
head
of
the
brewery
before
and
was
drawn
in
by
the
artwork
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
o
truly
a
work
of
art
i
am
hard
pressed
to
name
a
belgian
ale
ive
enjoyed
more
even
my
beloved
sours
the
smell
is
fantastic
its
everything
i
want
in
a
belgian
with
excellent
balance
there
was
so
much
going
on
in
the
first
couple
sips
it
took
me
a
minute
to
get
my
brain
around
all
that
was
going
on
with
the
flavor
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
white
fluffy
head
that
stays
around
a
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
fruity
the
brew
smells
like
pears
lemon
peel
bready
maltwheat
peppery
spice
cloves
and
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
i
think
the
spicy
and
bready
flavors
are
stronger
than
the
fruity
ones
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
green
grapes
and
an
herbal
flavor
to
the
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
high
but
soft
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
even
though
it
has
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
with
that
being
said
id
like
to
try
it
again
in
the
future

great
brew
and
reminds
me
of
a

hoppy

saison
o
one
of
brians
best

o
a
pretty
solid
bspa
good
work
from
stillwater
where
were
quick
to
applaude
delirium

and
lucifer
ales
for
exhibiting
similar
and
authentic
belgian
character
lets
not
forget
to
throw
this
one
into
the

ale
from

these
guys
are
great
o
as
follows
like
everything
else
ive
found
from
stillwater
is
a
well
done
and
interesting
beer
the
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
at
all
and
i
gladly
went
for
a
second
pint
very
different
and
refreshing
pours
a
golden
diaphanous
ale
with
a
thick
three
fingers
of
light
cream
this
falls
slowly
smells
of
hops
and
strongly
of
fresh
mint
never
had
this
experience
with
hops
but
ive
heard
tell
of
it
hints
of
resin
skunk
belgian
yeast
earthy
hay
and
soil
flavor
is
exceptional
grain
measured
bitterness
hints
of
grass
and
classy
belgian
yeast
character
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
medium
bodied
with
hi
sparkly
carb
even
a
bit
too
high
semi
dry
finish
a
really
fine
beer
i
questioned
this
brewery
with
its
obscure
labels
and
sudden
appearance
in
my
area
this
is
worth
it
o
a
really
nice
saision
thats
semifloral
and
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
o
overall
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
a
bit
on
the
spicy
peppery
side
of
things
and
earthy
like
a
saison
but
solid
nonetheless
i
tend
to
prefer
a
bit
less
spicing
and
more
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
hops
sweet
fruit
zesty
spice
and
belgian
yeast
notes
less
hop
forward
than
the
nose
suggests
but
theres
still
a
decent
amount
of
earthy
pine
and
sweet
citrustropical
fruit
hints
of
mango
pineapple
and
lemon
peel
a
lot
with
spicy
grassy
bitterness
not
very
dry
however
with
bready
yeast
alcohol
and
light
fruit
countering
the
hops
peppery
spice
with
possibly
some
coriander
followed
by
hints
of
apple
pear
and
booze
subtle
heat
but
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
makin
it
easy
to
drink
o
a
very
nice
beglian
pale
the
yeast
spice
hops
and
sugars
are
balanced
near
perfectly
a
very
hoppy
and
phenolic
finish
without
being
overwhelming
wellcrafted
highly
recommended
single
finger
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
cloudy
golden
body
aroma
is
full
with
corriander
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
standard
stillwater
aroma
very
herbal
taste
with
belgian
yeast
and
clove
up
front
finishing
with
a
citrus
and
herbal
hop
character
lighter
side
of
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
another
very
nice
brew
from
stillwater
the
belgian
character
is
excellent
ad
the
semi
dry
finish
is
right
on
for
the
style
so
drinkable
another
winner
from
stillwater
so
happy
to
get
this
in
mizzou
they
seem
at
least
3
bucks
a
bottle
cheaper
than
what
i
saw
in
north
carolina
very
drinkable
and
more
complex
than
most
belgo
strong
pales
ive
had
mostly
due
to
this
one
not
being
all
esters
something
just
makes
me
buy
every
single
stillwater
release
that
i
come
across
anyway
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
was
massive
even
with
a
slow
pour
it
was
out
of
control
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
slight
herbal
note
to
it
along
with
some
grains
that
add
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
clean
refreshing
taste
to
it
with
some
a
light
lemonlike
flavor
in
there
the
yeast
and
herbal
notes
are
the
most
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
very
drinkable
and
gently
carbonated
overall
its
not
my
favorite
from
stillwater
but
i
do
enjoy
trying
everything
that
comes
from
this
brewery
this
beer
is
a
real
winner
very
impressed
by
it
stillwater
really
nailed
this
one
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
o
one
of
the
most
likeable
bspas
ive
had
in
awhile
drinkable
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
in
the
future
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
wellmade
beer
worth
sampling
and
having
more
than
once
i
certainly
would
be
willing
to
have
this
one
again
served

fatigue
an
easy
drinker
for
such
a
big
beer
o
barnyard
earth
and
rye
dominate
the
flavor
profile
lemon
zest
and
hints
of
coriander
lye
beneath
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
albeit
very
funky
the
9
abv
is
masked
extremely
well
o
really
good
and
9
abv
is
very
well
hidden
i
had
this
on
draft
and
it
is
not
as
good
less
complex
i
am
guessing
that
warmth
is
helping
the
flavor
too
very
tasty
definitely
will
be
buying
more
o
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
very
well
hiddenit
drinks
like
a
regular
saison
but
with
the
flavors
kicked
up
a
notch
o
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
but
with
the
higher
abv
this
beer
is
just
a
little
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
wow
tried
both
the
draft
and
bottled
version
i
thought
the
bottled
version
was
showing
slightly
better
both
were
fantastic
sort
of
a
supersaison
best
analogy
that
i
can
make
is
as
follows
is
to
stateside
as
avec
les
bon
voeux
is
to
saison
dupont
here
goes
pours
a
hazy
glowing
white
gold
with
a
huge
lively
white
head
that
shrinks
to
proper
holds
well
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
nose
is
full
of
spicy
phenols
and
fruity
esters
that
seem
to
just
shoot
up
in
to
the
olfactory
factory
i
get
white
pepper
and
other
bright
spices
at
first
which
seems
to
be
balanced
by
pineapple
lemon
peach
and
maybe
some
melon
a
touch
of
sweetish
doughybready
malt
pokes
it
head
through
to
create
some
backbone
as
well
taste
is
boom
blast
off
fitting
to
be
drinking
stillwaters
anniversary
beer
on
the
same
day
as
the
anniversary
of
the
first
space
voyage
astronaut
yuri
gagaran
would
enjoy
this
no
doubt
taste
is
all
of
the
spicy
fruity
malty
yeasty
hoppy
notes
that
i
described
above
translated
in
an
almost
weightless
body
and
amplified
by
fairly
zippy
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
boozy
heat
spice
notes
seemed
to
lean
a
bit
towards
herbs
in
the
middle
and
i
was
thinking
i
could
taste
white
sage
andor
a
hint
of
eucalyptus
it
had
me
thinking
superstateside
at
first
then
supercellar
door
then
i
realized
this
was
just
superstillwater

turned
up
to

created
on
earth
but
heard
in
outer
space
extremely
wellbalanced
long
spicy
finish
with
a
very
clean
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
hazy
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
gorgeous
lacing
this
is
a
greatlooking
tripel
the
nose
is
wonderful
yeasty
spicy
and
with
a
nice
herbaceous
lemony
character
fresh
cut
grass
and
dry
pale
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
this
is
very
enjoyable
the
palate
has
a
nice
lemonlike
hop
character
a
very
nice
herbal
character
moderate
yeast
pepper
and
other
spices
and
a
crisp
clean
malt
profile
drying
and
spicy
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
in
body
crisply
carbonated
and
thoroughly
refreshing
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
too
highly
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
the
herbal
notes
in
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
light
and
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
i
would
have
it
again
body
is
light
and
somewhat
effervescent
with
a
dry
semibitter
finish
often
times
it
feels
like
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
better
portions
of
brians
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
very
tasty
overall
nothing
extraordinary
but
another
solid
beer
from
stillwater
nonetheless

solid
stuff
here
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
that
drinks
fairly
easy
could
see
myself
having
this
again
o
solid
beer
but
was
expecting
more
from
this
brewer
o
this
is
enjoyable
to
drink
so
fresh
and
clean
that
it
leaves
you
thirsty
and
satisfied
in
a
great
way
pours
a
dark
rich
honey
amber
that
almost
grades
into
russet
with
ample
billowing
duvel
style
foam
one
is
immediately
struck
by
the
strong
yeasty
esters
phenols
fruit
brown
spices
and
bready
malt
aromas
and
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
i
get
quite
a
lot
of
banana
which
combines
with
crystal
malt
sweetness
to
yield
a
banana
bread
effect
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
cloves
a
more
fragrant
noble
hop
perfume
some
apple
a
whole
ton
of
yeast
really
a
yeast
forward
beer
that
veers
into
cloying
at
times
whereas
duvel
stays
fruity
and
crisp
the
finish
is
dry
reasonably
bitter
and
very
earthy
calls
to
mind
ginseng
or
even
fresh
potatoes
or
other
root
vegetables
youve
got
several
takes
on
spice
all
vying
together
and
i
cant
say
the
whole
thing
is
as
balanced
as
maybe
it
should
be
but
it
aint
dull
there
are
medicinal
notes
and
almost
a
fermented
honey
vibe
like
mead
sweetness
and
earthy
bitterness
linger
for
a
long
time
and
i
get
some
overly
ripe
tropical
fruit
and
grassy
green
hops
fairly
bubbly
but
less
assertive
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
which
is
fine
in
terms
of
letting
the
nuances
shine
forth
i
laud
the
complexity
even
as
i
wonder
if
the
finish
is
overly
variegated
and
dank
unibroue
does
not
produce
a
bad
beer
this
one
is
very
good
but
not
a
world
beater
cf
their
dark
ale
and
tripel
offerings
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
this
lovely
ale
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
into
my
tulip
glass
smells
boldly
of
burnt
brown
sugar
candied
fruits
apricots
orange
peel
caramel
and
coriander
tastes
just
as
it
smells
big
sugary
notes
balanced
by
a
faint
bitterness
caramel
candied
fruits
pineapple
and
spices
are
present
throughout
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
i
frickin
love
this
ale
i
have
a
bottle
i
plan
on
aging
as
well
unibroue
la
seigneuriale
has
a
singularly
captivating
yeast
that
flatters
all
the
way
through
with
a
medley
of
absolutely
ambrosial
flavours
even
amongst
belgian
examples
this
beer
ranks
firstclass
as
do
the
majority
of
this
brewerys
offerings
ive
mentioned
christmas
a
few
times
and
indeed
i
can
think
of
few
things
better
to
find
wrapped
up
and
under
the
tree
perhaps
not
as
out
going
as
the
other
unibroues
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
now
if
this
would
stick
around
at
the
lcbo
3
75
d
this
is
real
nice
and
a
great
summer
option
as
its
a
bit
drier
and
lighter
tasting
than
other
unibroue
options
now
if
only
they
could
carry
their
other
offerings
id
be
set
od
nice
little
unibroue
beer
most
of
their
typical
flavours
are
shown
off
and
its
well
done
not
the
most
complex
of
the
style
but
it
seemed
appropriate
enjoyed
it
overall
another
excellent
belgian
strong
ale
by
unibroue
glad
to
see
this
one
come
to
alberta
o
a
very
easy
drinkable
pale
alcohol
is
hidden
would
work
well
with
lots
of
food
sweetness
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
for
my
liking
though
o
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
pairs
well
with
many
dishes
from
bbq
to
creamy
pastas
or
cheese
platters
the
alcohol
is
very
hidden
while
not
comparable
with
some
other
unibroue
offerings
i
will
definitely
pick
up
another
for
a
summer
patio
dinner
solid
brew
but
considering
who
brewed
it
i
thought
it
would
be
a
tad
better
im
still
happy
with
my
purchase
considering
the
price
point
but
id
probably
grab
a
different
unibroue
next
time
around
nice
not
too
inyour
face
definitely
sweet
but
there
is
a
nice
balance
it
doesnt
get
to
be
too
much
refreshing
and
crisp
not
bad
would
definitely
have
it
again
i
just
had
a
bottle
of
a
imperial
hefe
that
tasted
too
hot
and
one
dimensional
for
a
strong
summer
style
while
this
is
not
a
wheat
beer
it
does
taste
like
an
imperial
hefe
in
the
citrus
notes
and
the
light
spicy
notes
on
the
finish
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
has
a
lighter
touch
than
some
of
the
bigger
unibroue
beers
and
one
i
will
drink
more
often
an
agreeable
if
not
overly
complex
big
belgian
pale
ale
the
perceived
strength
kept
well
at
bay
as
usual
for
this
brewer
a
solid
somewhat
accelerated
intro
to
the
style
glad
i
finally
got
a
crack
at
it
overall
this
brewer
can
do
no
wrong
while
it
tastes
similar
to
the
other
unibroue
beers
it
has
some
nice
nuances
to
it
it
has
some
great
ripe
fruit
flavours
and
a
touch
of
malt
to
balance
out
the
yeast
its
kind
of
like
a
mix
of
a
trois
pistoles
and
a
maudite
ill
buy
some
more
while
its
available
o
good
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
in
comparison
to
unibroues
other
beers
im
happy
ive
got
more
in
my
fridge
but
would
take
their
other
offerings
over
it
any
day
o
unibroue
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
while
not
on
the
same
level
as
fin
du
monde
or
maudite
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
the
yeast
profile
that
unibroue
offers
and
this
beer
brings
it
again
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
yellowing
orange
this
is
some
variation
on
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
smell
offers
smoke
funk
fruit
and
cloves
the
taste
also
has
a
big
spice
component
mixed
in
with
the
usual
assortment
of
fruit
notes
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
bitter
from
quite
an
assertive
for
unibroue
hop
presence
overall
very
much
a
unibroue
beer
i
like
their
signature
flavour
and
thus
like
this
beer
not
the
best
in
their
lineup
but
certainly
good
o
enjoyable
curious
as
to
what
it
tasted
like
when
it
was
fresh
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip
best
by
07312009
pours
hazy
reddish
orange
color
with
a
fairly
dense
2
finger
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
some
small
bits
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
big
caramel
molasses
raisins
apple
grape
and
spicy
yeast
some
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
big
caramel
toffee
molasses
biscuit
citrus
grass
and
spiciness
initial
taste
in
the
front
tastes
just
like
dulce
de
leche
very
unique
stuff
no
bitterness
noticed
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
big
prickly
carbonation
as
expected
for
a
bottle
conditioned
brew
no
alcohol
noticed
except
for
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
very
nice
drinkability
with
great
balance
of
flavors
overall
a
very
interesting
and
excellent
belgian
ale
glad
i
got
to
experience
this
because
it
is
now
retired
overall
great
nice
fruits
sugars
yeast
flavors
belgian
malts
very
tasty
as
expected
from
unibroue
o
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
get
a
hold
of
please
bring
this
back
unibroue
nb
i
have
reason
to
suspect
this
may
have
been
stored
on
its
side
at
some
point
not
idea
for
beers
on
lees
as
unibroues
are
the
cork
was
dry
when
i
extracted
it
though
and
i
had
to
use
a
corkscrew
ive
been
a
fan
of
everything
ive
had
from
unibroue
except
this
one
the
bomber
i
had
was
just
beyond
the
best
by
date
and
that
could
be
the
problem
id
like
to
have
another
bottle
to
see
if
a
fresher
one
tasted
better
but
since
this
is
no
longer
brewed
i
can
only
go
with
what
ive
got
after
i
opened
this
i
realized
it
said
best
before
073109
hopefully
it
is
still
good
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
colour
with
thick
white
head
really
nice
head
retention
with
some
mild
lacing
smells
of
apples
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
belgian
yeastiness
flavour
is
quite
sweet
with
almost
a
hint
of
tartness
i
am
not
sure
if
this
has
gone
off
a
bit
but
it
still
is
quite
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
another
nice
beer
from
unibroue
i
can
definitely
see
that
this
beer
would
have
probably
been
yummy
a
few
years
ago
but
i
think
its
suffered
from
improper
storeaging
there
was
a
bunch
of
this
on
the
shelf
last
time
i
went
to
beers
of
the
world
i
almost
bought
two
im
not
sad
that
i
bought
one
but
im
sure
glad
i
didnt
get
another
the
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
less
than
impressive
flavor
profile
this
one
might
be
past
its
prime
a
solid
belgianstyle
ale
with
lots
of
flavour
and
some
interesting
fruitiness
i
dont
get
from
la
fin
due
monde
dthis
bottle
is
meant
to
be
shared
its
fun
to
have
but
ill
never
have
a
second
one
something
about
the
taste
makes
it
exhausting
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
while
not
bad
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
fuller
i
was
a
bit
concerned
as
to
how
well
this
would
hold
up
as
it
was
quite
beyond
the
best
by
date
no
worries
as
this
held
up
in
admirable
strong
pale
ale
style
hazy
light
caramel
color
with
peppery
prickly
carbonation
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
with
stolid
malt
and
tinges
of
apricot
the
overall
impression
was
duvel
with
a
touch
of
orval
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
few
years
on
it
i
really
enjoyed
it
my
best
experience
with
unibroue
so
far
notes
from
0207
d
im
a
very
big
fan
of
unibroue
this
is
one
i
wont
be
drinking
again
just
not
my
bag
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
what
i
look
for
d
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
they
continued
to
make
it
yeah
pleasant
beer
but
the
noticeable
alcohol
adds
a
sharpness
on
the
finish
which
lowers
consumption
level
slightly
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
rich
full
flavours
its
really
smooth
with
a
crispness
from
the
latent
acidity
a
really
really
lovely
drop
surprised
this
is
no
longer
made
d
drinkable
and
tasty
but
for
me
a
bomber
was
enough
for
today
to
bad
i
wont
have
the
chance
to
get
another
someday
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
bspa
but
i
like
the
other
bspas
that
unibroue
makes
a
little
better
maudite
and
don
de
dieu
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
probably
gain
more
complexity
and
flavor
with
some
cellaring
i
may
pick
some
more
up
before
its
gone
to
do
just
that
love
the
unibroue
beers
d
well
because
its
never
going
to
be
made
again
boo
i
cant
see
myself
finding
it
again
but
it
was
great
to
taste
a
retired
unibroue
beer
like
all
unibroue
this
is
an
interesting
beer
very
unique
beer
from
one
of
the
top
breweries
in
the
world
tastes
much
stronger
than
the
abv
suggests
not
an
easy
drinker
since
the
beer
is
so
thick
but
well
worth
seeking
out
unibroue
are
yet
to
disappoint
me
orange
amber
cloudy
with
fluffy
persistent
head
smells
very
inviting
with
fresh
baked
breadlike
yeastiness
and
peachy
stone
fruits
and
plenty
of
spice
on
the
palate
this
is
so
creamy
its
almost
sinful
similar
yeast
and
fruit
flavours
coming
through
beautifully
if
you
like
belgian
style
ales
there
isnt
much
to
dislike
about
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
nice
all
of
the
beers
from
unibroue
that
i
have
had
have
been
good
or
better
this
being
near
the
bottom
of
the
pack
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
other
unibroue
beers
but
even
a
less
than
outstanding
beer
from
them
is
still
worth
trying
not
one
ill
be
drinking
a
lot
of
i
think
if
the
citrus
was
more
dominant
would
have
been
better
still
and
interesting
offering
i
love
unibroue
and
their
brews
and
this
is
second
in
line
to
the
trois
pistols
re
fermentation
pours
a
cloudy
ambermaize
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
acid
yeast
and
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
yeast
acidity
slight
citrus
and
slight
hops
overall
very
high
level
of
carbonation
and
tartness
hurt
the
drinkability
but
still
a
good
body
and
blend
d
pretty
decent
drinkability
not
too
high
of
an
abv
and
a
good
taste
to
make
it
enjoyable
throughout
its
consumption
not
the
best
unibroue
but
it
is
still
pretty
good
although
i
was
excited
to
try
this
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
it
is
not
one
of
unibroues
stronger
offerings
personally
my
favorites
are
la
fin
du
monde
maudite
and
trois
pistoles
bottle
from
my
girlfriend
a
deep
and
murkymuddy
caramel
pour
leaves
nice
spotty
lace
and
has
a
frothy
beige
cap
nose
is
quite
yeasty
followed
by
a
blast
of
tropical
fruit
like
guava
and
mango
some
pear
and
apricot
too
lots
of
spices
here
meet
a
decent
amount
of
floral
hops
tastes
of
dark
pit
fruits
in
contrast
to
the
nose
of
the
lighter
tropical
fruits
dark
plum
and
prune
with
pear
running
up
the
back
solid
spicing
and
hopping
balance
the
fruity
sweetness
creamy
and
dangerously
drinkable
excellent
750ml
bottle
served
in
my
bruery
tulip
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
three
inch
offwhite
head
that
fizzed
and
popped
as
it
slowly
receded
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
some
slashes
of
lacing
but
somewhat
weak
legs
candi
sugar
and
light
fruit
perhaps
tangerine
and
apricot
dominate
the
nose
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
prickly
a
little
too
much
carbonation
and
the
sensation
follows
from
start
to
finish
consistency
fell
between
light
and
mediumbodied
nice
belgian
pale
a
solid
b
in
my
book
however
could
have
been
an
a
if
it
was
a
little
less
effervescent
while
i
wouldnt
say
its
among
the
best
unibroues
ive
tried
its
certainly
not
the
worst
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
it
was
widely
available
but
this
is
actually
the
only
bottle
of
seigneuriale
ive
seen
around
for
months
are
they
fazing
this
one
out
not
as
interesting
as
some
of
their
stronger
beers
but
more
refreshing
in
exchange
great
unibroue
for
the
summer
drinkability
hard
to
think
of
this
as
a
bspa
as
it
verges
into
the
bsda
territory
although
i
think
my
bottle
may
be
an
older
version
as
i
suspect
it
may
be
around
three
years
old
nevertheless
a
rather
nice
sipper
d
excellent
a
fairly
basic
brew
its
no
duvel
but
one
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
another
winner
from
unibroue
this
beer
does
not
leave
a
lasting
impression
i
have
long
been
a
fan
of
unibroue
but
there
beers
have
been
hit
and
miss
for
the
past
few
years
seigneuriale
is
very
much
a
big
hit
with
me
d
quite
drinkable
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
a
nice
belgian
beer
for
the
summer
compared
some
of
the
other
unibroue
offerings
not
as
intense
as
some
of
the
other
unibroue
offerings
which
can
in
a
way
be
a
good
thing
the
sweetish
apricot
flavours
and
subtle
dry
alcohol
make
this
an
amazing
beer
to
drink
maybe
borderline
my
favourite
alongside
don
de
dieu
and
la
fin
du
monde
drinkability
good
sipping
beer
well
thought
out
and
crafted
la
seigneuriale
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
big
white
head
from
a
corked
and
caged
brown
750
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
and
a
touch
fruity
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
fruity
along
the
lines
of
pear
or
peach
a
touch
of
spice
alcohol
is
not
particularly
noticeable
but
it
is
present
tastes
like
a
pretty
good
version
of
a
belgian
recommended
d
polishing
off
a
bomber
is
easy
polishing
off
two
would
be
work
not
just
because
of
the
alcohol
but
this
beers
flavor
doesnt
change
or
have
any
depth
to
keep
it
interesting
notes
as
i
continue
my
week
plus
of
unibroue
sampling
this
one
returns
the
brewery
in
my
mind
to
great
form
after
the
underwhelming
blanche
de
chambly
d
not
a
bad
brew
i
would
pull
for
a
stronger
malt
profile
and
maybe
a
bit
more
candy
sweetness
nice
and
light
with
decent
flavors
i
picked
this
one
up
the
other
day
as
for
me
it
seems
to
be
harder
to
find
i
was
going
to
try
the
don
de
dieu
but
figured
that
one
seems
to
be
more
readily
available
so
my
thoughts
where
lets
give
this
one
a
try
pours
to
a
nice
orange
color
with
some
copper
highlights
big
thick
head
that
had
nice
retention
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
though
i
thought
there
would
be
more
the
aroma
is
very
nice
normal
unibroue
yeast
aroma
comes
to
mind
at
first
fruit
is
there
as
well
as
a
nice
but
subtle
spice
very
inviting
aroma
the
taste
while
good
just
did
not
seem
to
be
there
for
me
the
spice
comes
out
more
here
i
seem
to
notice
that
first
clove
also
present
is
the
yeast
which
seems
to
give
a
slight
fruit
like
ester
apple
at
least
that
is
where
i
think
it
is
coming
from
slight
sweetness
that
reminds
me
sightly
of
brown
sugar
as
i
started
to
say
the
flavors
are
good
but
for
me
they
seem
to
be
missing
a
little
something
does
not
stand
up
to
the
aroma
i
would
get
some
of
the
other
strong
ales
that
they
offer
before
i
get
this
one
again
pous
a
medium
brown

very

very

dark

perfumy

taste
not
as

as
the
aroma
dark
heavy
tasting
tastes
like
a
belgian
sttrong
some
smoke
for
sure
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
can
drink
all
night
very
good
wish
i
could
get
this
one
easily
i
havent
found
it
in

i
need
to

nothing
extreme
but
a
smiple
brew
put
together
well
d
seigneuriale
is
some
great
stuff
another
solid
beer
from
unibroue
that
is
recommended
i
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
vault
into
my
favourite
unibroues
because
the
reviews
have
quite
a
number
of
the
other
beers
classed
above
seigneuriale
but
the
flavour
just
pulled
me
in
im
a
sucker
for
caramel
spice
and
raisin
flavours
and
the
abundance
of
these
made
sure
i
was
on
to
a
surefire
winner
asides
from
the
flavour
the
element
that
most
impressed
me
was
the
mouthfeel
i
usually
let
most
unibroues
sit
for
a
while
to
let
the
carbonation
calm
down
but
this
was
already
a
fantastic
match
for
the
flavour
profile
an
excellent
choice
hate
to
not
like
a
unibroue
beer
but
this
one
is
bland
smells
great
and
tastes
watered
down
its
not
overly
clovey
and
spicy
like
other
unibroue
beers
i
bought
this
last
thanksgiving
it
held
up
nice
i
enjoyed
this
and
glad
i
had
one
in
the
late
fall
as
this
was
the
epitome
of
the
season
definitely
would
drink
this
again
i
have
yet
to
drink
a
bad
unibroue
this
is
nearly
10
months
from
its
best
by
date
but
it
strikes
me
as
having
a
bit
of
past
its
prime
flavor
maybe
thats
actually
what
theyre
going
for
with
the
super
ripe
starting
to
rot
fruit
characteristics
and
the
super
musty
yeast
its
ok
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
although
i
would
not
turn
it
down
either
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
though
not
the
first
of
the
unibroues
id
grab
it
is
a
great
addition
to
the
family
the
abv
isnt
as
high
as
usual
and
while
still
beefy
somewhat
of
a
reprieve
from
the
normal
9
monsters
thus
this
is
certainly
a
nice
sessionable
belgian
a
bright
fresh
and
young
belgian
pale
the
tart
fruityesters
are
the
standout
here
which
makes
this
offering
so
pleasantly
unique
d
like
every
unibroue
beer
ive
tried
this
is
a
well
made
flavorful
beer
while
its
not
my
favorite
of
their
products
its
still
very
nice
i
enjoyed
this
unibroue
continues
to
impress
me
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
is
ok
half
a
bomber
works
fine
for
me
but
i
prefer
the
don
de
dieu
as
a
unibroue
strong
pale
ale
yeast
sediment
adds
a
nice
soured
flavor
and
delivers
some
more
bready
flavors
d
this
is
another
good
begianstyle
brew
from
unibroue
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
hazy
reddish
golden
color
with
a
nice
dense
off
white
head
that
settled
into
a
thick
cap
the
aroma
is
of
green
apples
and
tart
raspberries
candi
sugar
and
a
nice
honey
floral
scent
the
taste
is
of
honey
and
tart
raspberries
nice
earthy
belgian
yeast
which
gives
the
brew
a
musty
flavor
some
hop
action
in
the
end
to
add
a
balancing
bitterness
the
feel
is
light
and
very
fizzy
slightly
slick
and
finishes
with
a
musty
fruity
sweetness
a
very
nice
offering
from
unibroue
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
a
nice
fruity
bspa
recommended
d
this
beer
is
dry
with
a
lot
of
apple
flavors
while
still
being
pretty
thin
on
flavor
and
complexity
i
was
hoping
that
there
would
be
some
support
by
the
yeast
but
it
just
wasnt
there
always
consistent
quality
beers
from
unibroue
so
i
was
very
pleased
to
see
this
one
new
on
the
shelf
the
pour
is
quite
active
with
tons
of
carbonation
that
results
in
a
huge
foamy
and
thick
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
color
is
a
hazy
copper
smells
of
pears
apples
grapes
and
some
dark
fruits
blended
in
with
a
slight
phenolic
essence
a
subtle
breadiness
lurks
underneath
it
all
tastes
fruity
and
spicy
and
a
bit
more
crisp
than
expected
some
definite
alcohol
heat
is
felt
although
the
alcohol
content
isnt
that
high
theres
some
good
hop
bitterness
mixed
in
well
which
is
more
apparent
toward
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
necessarily
up
to
the
standard
this
brewery
has
created
drinkability
this
could
pass
for
an
imperial
witbier
if
there
was
such
a
thing
i
found
more
qualities
towards
a
wit
than
a
pale
ale
very
good
though
whatever
the
style
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
looked
like
dirty
lake
water
with
a
twofinger
foamy
head
kinda
scary
but
the
smell
and
taste
made
up
for
it
figs
raisins
bananas
toffee
and
a
little
mint
came
across
the
mouth
and
nose
wonderfully
nice
tingle
on
the
tastebuds
with
this
one
will
enjoy
again
really
soon
overall
nice
and
light
not
too
rich
very
drinkable
taste
was
like
lemon
rind
at
first
but
quickly
mellowed
to
a
nice
blend
of
fruit
and
hops
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
we
drank
this
rather
cool
and
enjoyed
every
moment
another
fine
unibroue
offering
d
didnt
really
fit
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
guidelines
so
i
threw
them
out
when
judging
it
nevertheless
the
flavors
never
really
gelled
for
me
unibroue
certainly
makes
better
beers
than
this
one
d
a
standard
unibroue
it
has
the
unibroue
qualities
and
characteristics
but
lacks
the
character
that
distinguishes
their
better
beers
from
eachother
however
its
lack
of
extremes
makes
it
an
easy
beer
to
take
inoffensive
riffs
on
traditional
belgian
styles
and
they
prove
it
again
with
seigneuriale
poured
a
light
caramel
color
with
a
thick
white
head
very
cloudy
sweet
aromas
of
citrus
malt
honey
flavors
are
layered
beginning
with
the
same
citus
and
honey
some
herbs
then
some
subtle
vanilla
at
the
finish
at
times
it
seems
that
im
drinking
a
light
mead
strong
carbonation
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
despite
the
7
5
abv
the
metallic
notes
and
vinuouslike
dryness
slow
it
down
a
very
good
brew
overall
but
i
cant
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
overall
drinkable
for
sure
but
just
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
unibroue
offerings
d
this
beer
gets
a
pretty
good
beating
from
many
reviewers
and
i
will
concur
that
it
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
unibroue
however
having
said
that
this
is
a
completely
enjoyable
beer
that
pays
admirable
homage
to
some
of
the
finest
belgian
ales
i
will
happily
drink
more
of
this
as
an
after
dinner
sipper
poured
it
into
a
snifter
and
got
a
medium
dark
hazy
body
with
some
mild
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
fluffy
head
that
seems
to
just
sit
there
there
is
some
good
lacing
as
well
this
looks
like
a
really
great
beer
overall
there
are
some
mild
malty
aromas
that
come
out
along
with
some
sweet
fruits
scents
mixed
in
with
some
spices
it
has
a
strong
and
refreshing
feel
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
it
has
a
mild
body
and
you
can
taste
the
spices
in
it
very
little
malts
flavors
in
it
but
there
is
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
and
it
is
a
bit
dry
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
over
all
but
unibroue
has
done
better
750ml
bottle
with
cork
purchased
this
because
i
had
enjoyed
other
unibroue
ales
from
a
variety
pack
poured
about
34
of
the
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
leaving
much
of
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
good
head
at
first
dissipates
quickly
dark
amber
and
hazy
very
fruit
forward
smell
taste
is
the
same
my
girlfriend
had
a
try
and
correctly
commented
on
the
syrupy
flavor
and
cough
medicine
finish
very
thick
and
sugary
malty
to
say
the
least
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
very
strong
and
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
prefer
unibroues
maudite
strong
amber
over
this
one
la
seigneuriale
is
a
play
on
words
meaning
the
divine
ale
thats
a
fantastic
name
but
if
a
brewery
is
going
to
make
a
claim
like
that
they
better
back
it
up
with
a
beer
that
is
equally
fantastic
tomme
arthur
could
probably
knock
something
similar
out
of
the
park
call
me
a
sucker
for
unis
pale
beverages
it
carries
much
of
the
same
yeasty
unibroue
familiarity
but
the
slightly
acidic
lean
of
this
makes
it
stand
out
its
like
a
slightly
tarter
lighter
tableversion
of
la
fin
du
monde
i
cant
help
but
like
that
notes
looking
at
some
earlier
reviews
i
see
mention
of
raisiny
apple
etc
flavours
but
the
review
immediately
before
mine
speaks
much
the
same
language
maybe
there
are
some
offbottles
floating
around
maybe
its
just
a
case
of
taste
who
knows
i
would
be
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
based
solely
on
my
satisfaction
with
their
other
products
at
a
later
date
mouthfeeldrinkability
for
a
unibroue
beer
the
texture
is
really
terrific
easy
and
seafoamy
it
becomes
more
light
as
the
tasting
progresses
im
just
not
loving
the
overall
taste
and
experience
here
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
that
id
choose
first
overall
a
decent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
d
i
love
unibroue
and
this
did
taste
good
but
the
carbonation
was
too
much
of
a
turnoff
d
probably
not
something
id
drink
often
but
pretty
complex
without
being
too
overpowering
worth
a
try
and
something
id
drink
again
d
great
beer
with
a
great
finish
great
choice
for
anyone
who
likes
unibrou
personally
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
brewery
this
is
a
rather
odd
beer
i
think
it
reminds
me
of
chimay
red
or
ommegang
rare
vos
more
than
any
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
has
elements
of
a
farmhouse
too
the
artwork
suggests
it
ive
got
way
too
many
more
beers
to
try
before
ill
return
to
this
one
overalls
a
well
made
beer
from
a
winning
brewery
buy
it
now
this
beer
pours
out
a
ruby
redbrown
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
that
lasts
and
provides
some
awesome
lacing
as
well
the
aromas
are
not
too
strong
but
i
smell
some
wonderful
fruits
fresh
baked
bread
spices
including
cloves
coriander
cinnamon
and
more
pumpkin
pie
and
apple
pie
the
taste
is
wonderfully
fruity
and
spicy
the
spices
hit
up
front
with
some
wonderful
sweet
fruit
notes
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
bready
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
it
is
medium
bodiedfull
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
excellent
unibroues
version
is
a
good
recreation
but
their
house
yeast
does
kill
some
of
the
complexity
for
me
hard
to
say
though
as
the
real
deal
ive
had
was
aged
for
years
and
this
is
a
somewhat
fresh
bottle
still
its
good
di
really
like
unibroue
beers
and
this
one
is
another
winner
ive
never
seen
it
around
my
area
before
i
will
be
buying
more
d
give
it
to
me
man
this
strikes
me
as
quite
underrated
at
this
point
7
5
abv
never
becomes
a
detriment
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
unibroue
offering
to
date
granted
i
havent
yet
tried
trois
pistoles
but
this
is
a
great
beer
i
like
it
more
than
la
fin
du
monde
very
assertive
strong
effort
in
a
style
with
many
heavyweight
contenders
riche
et
onctueuse
cette
bière
réchauffe
le
coeur
et
se
boit
avec
facilité
d
a
very
good
belgian
style
drink
and
a
definite
recommend
sweet
spicy
and
lively
providing
for
an
enjoyable
experience
copped
a
750ml
bottle
caged
and
corked
from
garys
in
madison
one
of
the
only
beers
from
unibroue
that
i
wasnt
able
to
find
in
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
rubyred
darkorange
color
with
minimal
head
that
soon
dissipated
smell
is
complete
with
citrus
oranges
and
pears
flavor
is
bombarded
with
fresh
fruit
tangerine
floral
essence
and
grapefruit
a
very
intricate
rich
thick
and
satisfying
beer
that
is
heavy
on
flavor
and
creaminess
a
very
good
pleasing
beer
that
is
certainly
another
winner
from
unibroue
outstanding
sample
that
i
only
wish
was
available
in
six
or
four
packs
as
many
brews
from
this
company
are
excellent
creamy
and
rich
mouthfeel
with
wonderful
drinkability
hard
to
notice
alcohol
that
is
wellmasked
behind
a
cornucopia
of
wonderful
flavors
and
aroma
good
choice
from
unibroue
definitely
recommended
not
a
bad
beer
but
given
all
the
great
unibroue
beers
available
i
dont
think
this
one
would
be
a
priority
purchase
for
me
i
prefer
many
of
their
other
offerings
to
this
one
in
the
end
tasty
but
not
phenomenal
whats
the
difference
i
could
drink
it
all
night
i
might
not
drive
across
town
to
find
it
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
red
color
with
orange
hues
the
head
is
large
rocky
and
off
white
it
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
anise
dates
and
the
unibroue
house
yeast
the
taste
is
of
dates
anise
caramel
plums
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
yet
with
a
sugary
texture
weird
very
weird
but
interesting
overall
this
is
a
very
thought
provoking
beer
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
and
again
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
does
not
assault
palate
or
ruin
it
for
further
tastes
of
other
beers
d
this
is
a
characteristic
belgian
amber
ale
its
really
time
that
this
website
differentiates
between
pale
dark
and
amber
i
notice
some
of
these
are
placed
with
pales
while
others
with
darks
anyway
this
is
a
good
solid
example
of
a
belgian
amber
ale
and
a
job
well
done
by
unibroue
when
poured
the
color
was
of
a
hazy
copper
with
very
little
foam
that
disapated
in
seconds
and
no
lace
the
aroma
of
a
spice
like
corriander
was
evident
along
with
an
apple
cider
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
had
a
bit
of
apple
corriander
and
a
hint
of
a
fruity
nature
i
really
like
this
belgium
ale
it
wasnt
over
powering
on
the
flavor
seem
to
get
better
when
the
temperature
was
between
55
and
60
degrees
a
fruit
smell
with
help
i
think
it
may
be
pear
i
also
pick
up
on
perhaps
some
coriander
the
appearance
is
solid
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
after
you
allow
it
to
sit
i
only
notice
the
pear
in
the
background
more
coriander
in
the
fore
spiced
for
sure
maybe
some
ginger
a
soft
finish
soft
like
35
years
soft
baby
duck
or
nelson
biterman
the
4th
you
must
see
lets
go
to
prison
way
overcarbonaited
for
what
it
claims
to
be
but
i
do
like
it
myself
downs
pretty
damn
easy
overall
not
bad
a
good
gateway
to
real
belgians
seigneuriale
is
on
odd
odd
version
of
a
belgian
pale
pours
a
hazy
orange
brown
with
good
head
that
retains
at
about
half
a
finger
the
nose
is
of
apples
and
spices
the
first
taste
is
of
light
fruit
with
some
cobbler
taste
and
pie
crust
with
spice
very
fizzy
and
way
more
carbonated
than
a
belgian
strong
pale
should
be
the
spices
stand
out
on
the
finish
aftertaste
could
linger
for
longer
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
overcarbonation
is
slightly
abrasive
drinkability
is
good
could
pound
as
its
thin
and
the
abv
is
low
good
beer
on
the
better
half
of
the
unibroue
selection
fuzzy
orangeamber
body
with
a
thin
lace
aroma
of
yeasty
fruits
and
spice
cardamom
and
clove
touches
of
orange
taste
reminds
me
instantly
of
other
unibroue
beers
particularly
maudite
apples
and
mango
candy
bubble
gum
oranges
spice
ginger
and
wood
very
spritzy
mouthfeel
too
spritzy
otherwise
light
and
balanced
leaning
towards
dry
drinkable
and
clean
di
was
expecting
a
la
fin
du
monde
copy
but
this
is
different
a
bit
more
funky
and
maltier
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
wish
i
saw
more
of
sufficiently
hoppy
this
could
be
a
bipa
d
quite
drinkable
when
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
snifter
it
produced
a
light
reddishbrown
color
with
a
tall
light
head
that
settled
to
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
it
smelled
of
dried
fruit
prunes
candied
sugar
with
light
spice
it
tasted
sweet
like
dried
fruit
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
dry
finish
plenty
of
carbonation
but
maybe
a
bit
thin
still
another
great
offering
from
unibroue
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
a
step
below
la
fin
du
monde
but
has
a
character
all
its
own
sweet
and
sour
this
brew
distinguishes
itself
fro
the
other
unibroue
selections
overall
another
fine
beer
from
unibrou
taste
is
very
complex
with
lots
of
fruity
elements
and
definitely
some
alcohol
heat
and
phenols
there
is
that
brett
influenceever
strong
and
i
am
liking
this
a
lot
i
didnt
know
that
unibroue
even
did
beers
with
wild
yeast
involved
a
nice
version
of
the
style
and
considering
how
strong
and
sour
it
isid
say
very
drinkable
d
at
first
seemed
very
similar
taste
to
other
unibroues
but
developed
distinct
character
not
the
best
one
ive
had
but
worth
another
try
easy
to
drink
as
always
overall
a
good
strong
pale
good
maltysweet
character
leaves
me
wanting
more
definitely
recommended
definitely
drinkable
and
definitely
one
i
hope
ill
be
able
to
find
in
my
area
southern
california
soon
yet
another
high
quality
ale
from
unibroue
they
never
fail
to
impress
me
bottle
poured
a
red
colored
beer
with
a
huge
head
with
excellent
retention
carbonation
is
perfect
with
lots
of
bubbles
coming
back
on
top
minutes
after
the
beer
was
poured
aroma
is
comprised
of
a
very
enticing
mix
of
spice
and
some
sweet
fruit
such
as
orange
wow
this
one
really
does
it
for
me
and
its
a
shame
that
this
brewery
was
bought
by
sleeman
and
those
are
the
last
bottle
we
will
see
eric
this
is
not
on
the
level
of
la
fin
du
monde
in
my
opinion
but
it
is
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
hadnt
tried
this
particular
unibroue
yet
la
seigneuriale
is
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
stemmed
tulip
glass
with
the
typical
unibroue
high
volume
of
carbonation
the
head
is
bright
white
rises
quickly
and
falls
slowly
leaving
a
persistent
collar
of
foam
the
color
is
a
hazyorange
la
seigneuriale
smells
good
with
a
sort
of
apricotbutterscotchtoffee
aroma
heavy
on
the
apricot
the
aroma
is
most
certainly
devoid
of
hops
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
are
tasted
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
sweet
with
some
fruityapricot
esters
it
finishes
sweet
just
dry
enough
to
not
be
cloying
this
is
a
beer
for
malt
heads
and
those
who
appreciate
estery
ales
the
potency
is
also
more
than
the
7
5
percent
alcohol
would
suggest
one
750ml
bottle
is
certainly
more
than
enough
for
one
person
pours
a
dark
orange
leaving
a
clear
body
with
carbonation
bubbles
and
leaves
a
thick
creamy
tanorange
head
the
aroma
is
fruit
plums
candied
sugar
beets
a
ton
of
playful
fruit
and
herbs
going
on
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
highly
carbonated
but
smooth
with
a
gentle
alcohol
feel
finishing
fruity
and
refreshing
i
typically
love
unibroue
beers
and
this
one
is
no
different
quality
beer
and
i
will
visit
it
again
drinkabilitynotes
wellcrafted
and
very
drinkable
certainly
should
be
tried
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
somewhat
simple
compared
to
their
other
brews
extremely
tasty
perhaps
im
nitpicking
on
the
scores
but
i
dropped
almost
each
one
a
half
point
for
lack
of
fidelity
to
the
stated
style
its
not
the
golden
carbonation
blaster
that
i
think
of
with
a
bspa
and
there
is
perhaps
more
of
a
maris
otter
or
crystal
malt
than
the
pale
slightly
grainy
character
im
used
to
rated
purely
on
merit
this
is
a
brilliant
concoction
very
drinkable
and
as
close
to
a
session
beer
as
ive
had
from
unibroue
its
rather
light
in
bodied
and
well
carbonated
though
features
less
malt
and
yeast
than
one
might
expect
its
a
bit
harsh
and
sour
to
be
all
that
drinkable
not
one
of
unibroues
best
efforts
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
beer
on
the
local
shelf
hadnt
heard
of
this
unibroue
choice
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
my
duvel
tulip
barely
contained
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
taste
is
delicious
a
little
drier
than
some
of
the
other
offerings
in
this
style
and
offering
nice
tastes
of
fruit
yeast
and
spices
the
alcohol
taste
is
present
without
being
overwhelming
an
excellent
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
rich
rewarding
could
be
drunk
with
fruit
pies
obviously
but
also
creme
caramel
or
a
light
citrus
souffle
worth
the
money
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
as
i
bought
this
beer
as
a
clearance
item
and
despite
their
reputation
i
didnt
like
the
one
other
beer
that
ive
tried
from
unibroue
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
i
liked
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
its
wellworth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
aroma
is
unmistakeably
unibrouebelgian
yeast
fruity
sweet
and
honeyed
some
cola
soft
but
lively
carbonation
makes
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
creamy
but
full
of
verve
the
taste
is
honey
brown
sugar
malty
with
nice
balance
of
bubble
gum
with
a
solid
hoppy
bitter
backbone
there
is
a
lightness
and
crispness
here
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
perhaps
more
so
than
the
heavier
unibroue
efforts
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
less
carbonated
than
i
like
in
a
bspa
not
too
drinkable
for
me
because
of
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
carbonation
also
the
high
alcohol
content
a
decent
ale
not
unibroues
best
try
it
once
at
least
my
first
disappointment
from
unibroue
a
sad
day
the
body
is
fairly
thin
with
a
dry
and
spicy
feel
decent
bitterness
with
very
little
hops
flavor
nothing
too
impressive
but
not
bad
either
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
in
the
future
but
im
very
glad
that
i
tried
it
d
mmm
once
again
very
good
pours
a
murky
golden
darkyellow
not
one
of
unibroues
better
looking
beers
a
nice
head
forms
upon
pouring
but
it
settles
into
a
barely
noticeable
lace
that
circles
the
glass
for
the
remainder
of
the
serving
grapes
figs
and
bananas
overtake
the
aromas
while
the
beer
has
a
much
sweeter
taste
than
most
of
the
brewerys
offerings
with
a
hop
bitterness
and
dryness
following
that
up
muted
fruity
taste
has
a
nit
of
a
champagnelike
taste
to
it
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
bière
de
garde
in
that
respect
a
good
taste
and
a
drinkable
beer
but
all
in
all
though
this
is
not
one
of
unibroues
better
offerings
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
carbonation
with
a
very
good
drinkability
750ml
corked
caged
bottle
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
that
continues
to
effervesce
up
the
center
of
the
glass
smells
of
phenols
pepper
and
bubblegum
the
taste
is
strong
pepper
spice
up
front
with
earthy
flavors
following
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
none
of
the
sugar
promised
by
the
bubblegum
flavor
comes
through
the
mouthfeel
is
trademark
unibroue
silky
with
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
by
the
bitter
finish
my
palette
warms
to
it
a
bit
over
time
a
good
brew
but
not
my
favorite
by
this
very
good
brewery
overall
a
decent
beer
unibroue
rarely
disappoints
me
especially
for
the
price
this
however
isnt
the
greatest
one
out
there
still
good
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
sometimes
i
wish
that
unibroue
would
find
a
second
yeast
strain
the
one
they
have
is
great
but
it
does
get
a
little
tired
and
gives
all
of
their
beers
the
same
distinct
flavor
not
a
bad
thing
id
just
like
to
see
what
they
can
do
with
another
strain
what
a
interesting
beer
drinks
a
bit
slow
due
to
some
flavors
that
i
dont
like
many
belgian
freaks
will
like
this
more
than
i
did
worth
a
try
though
i
assume
aging
this
a
while
will
only
improve
this
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
it
yields
a
huge
lighttan
head
that
fills
a
good
half
of
the
glass
it
slowly
settles
to
a
rocky
thick
head
like
all
of
the
other
unibroue
beers
do
so
well
the
smell
is
rather
grapey
compared
to
the
other
unibroue
beers
ive
had
so
far
it
has
a
semicloudy
body
that
is
a
deep
amberorange
color
moderatetovigorous
carbonation
the
taste
is
full
of
complexity
and
flavor
rich
with
berries
and
fruit
moderately
apparent
alcohol
esterish
taste
and
a
tart
ending
the
aftertaste
has
figs
bananas
and
a
tongue
tingling
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
would
have
had
a
4
0
if
it
hadnt
had
such
a
burn
to
it
the
la
fin
and
the
don
both
have
more
alcohol
and
littletono
burn
maybe
a
cellaring
is
due
overall
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
right
in
line
with
the
other
unibroue
beers
what
a
solid
beer
company
d
very
drinkable
another
winner
from
unibroue
this
is
a
great
beer
representative
of
its
style
but
it
is
rather
hard
to
have
lots
of
it
is
a
great
beer
you
can
sip
and
enjoy
tasting
but
not
something
you
can
or
would
want
to
get
smashed
on
probably
one
of
my
favourite
beers
by
unibroue
and
thats
saying
quite
a
lot
this
beer
poured
a
medium
cloudy
amber
color
and
formed
an
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
practically
boiling
an
aroma
of
yeast
clove
and
pepper
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
some
bread
elements
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
finish
was
medium
light
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
sweet
finish
not
their
best
rendition
but
still
a
good
beer
another
solid
brew
from
unibroue
although
not
one
of
their
very
best
completely
drinkable
i
consumed
the
entire
bottle
with
ease
however
there
are
several
other
unibroue
beers
that
i
would
purchase
again
before
this
one
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
73109
pours
a
cloudy
medium
amber
with
a
23
finger
head
good
longevity
and
good
lace
aromas
of
apples
and
tart
fruits
in
general
mixed
with
honey
some
yeastiness
and
phenols
as
well
starts
off
sweet
but
quickly
fades
into
a
tart
fruit
and
honey
like
maltiness
bready
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
fairly
easy
drinking
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
but
very
nice
indeed
750
ml
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
thick
opaque
golden
with
a
lot
of
fluffy
head
smells
sharp
and
spicy
no
sweet
tastes
a
little
sweeter
though
a
bite
of
alcohol
a
tad
harsh
feels
fairly
thick
finishes
lighter
and
sharper
id
probably
go
for
variety
its
good
but
not
excellent
pours
a
dark
gold
really
more
of
an
amber
with
bright
golden
highlights
and
a
luscious
cap
of
foam
that
fades
over
time
to
a
collar
cloudy
with
roused
yeast
aroma
full
of
phenolic
and
estery
compounds
mostly
bananas
along
with
a
juicy
light
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
raw
alcohol
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
a
harsh
note
comes
through
where
there
should
be
softness
pale
malts
minor
fruitiness
at
the
front
then
rising
hop
bitterness
at
the
middle
and
into
the
finish
smooth
phenols
come
out
at
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
has
some
bracing
bitterness
and
plenty
of
acidity
along
with
a
bigger
body
than
i
expected
from
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
but
not
excellent
strong
pale
ale
overall
impression
good
drinking
fruity
peppery
yeast
characteristics
were
the
most
notable
elements
a
nice
addition
to
the
unibroue
choices
here
in
texas
good
beer
easier
to
drink
than
average
unibroues
although
less
pronounced
taste
subtle
tasteful
and
complexa
very
nice
beer
from
unibroue
not
as
drinkable
as
some
unibrous
but
very
enjoyable
flavours
are
well
expressed
despite
dryish
body
a
bit
more
acidic
that
the
usual
offerings
from
the
canadians
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
what
an
intriguing
beer
reminds
me
very
much
of
maudite
but
with
loads
of
added
citrus
very
drinkable
and
just
another
great
beer
to
add
to
the
unibroue
line
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
an
orangy
amber
with
pretty
good
head
to
start
with
sticks
around
for
a
bit
settling
down
into
a
thin
foam
with
a
collar
around
the
drink
some
lace
left
behind
at
the
top
aroma
is
sweet
and
lightly
spicy
light
fruits
yummy
malts
just
the
faintest
flowery
hop
and
a
little
yeasty
perhaps
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
the
alcohol
slightly
warming
the
mouth
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
lots
of
fruits
lots
of
sweets
lots
of
yums
another
unibroue
that
i
like
but
not
love
unusual
d
it
is
good
but
not
one
of
unibroues
best
they
have
a
lot
better
stuff
out
there
imo
impressively
rounded
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
unibroue
has
produced
a
remarkable
strong
and
lightlyspiced
version
of
an
everyday
belgian
pale
ale
it
makes
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
lighter
meats
fowl
pork
and
pairs
well
with
sweeter
vegetables
glazed
carrots
yams
cut
corn
it
makes
an
excellent
after
dinner
tipple
as
well
quite
enjoyable
these
newer
unibroue
beers
are
all
very
good
but
its
getting
harder
and
harder
to
distinguish
them
from
each
other
i
wish
one
would
just
step
out
and
do
something
a
little
different
but
im
really
just
nitpicking
this
is
still
a
superbly
crafted
beer
from
a
wonderful
brewery
as
i
just
implied
this
beer
is
drinkable
damn
drinkable
really
maybe
the
dryness
and
biting
alcoholic
finish
makes
this
a
traditionalists
stop
reading
a
session
beer
imo
this
is
in
the
upper
half
of
the
unibroue
lineup
which
is
saying
something
i
really
want
to
try
this
again
i
didnt
find
it
a
great
beer
but
i
liked
it
it
just
jives
with
me
my
750ml
was
purchased
in
omaha
i
want
another
worth
a
try
da
unibroue
make
a
very
clean
and
pure
tasting
beer
this
one
is
no
exception
easy
to
drink
at
7
5
drinkability
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
quaff
this
is
no
means
a
session
beer
but
more
like
a
slow
sipper
you
can
drink
all
night
a
new
brew
from
unibroue
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
an
orval
chalice
it
had
the
appearance
of
oerbier
hazy
opaque
dark
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
foam
you
can
smell
above
all
the
aroma
of
unibroue
house
yeast
with
all
the
fruity
esters
it
brings
out
in
the
beer
based
on
smell
alone
it
would
be
hard
to
separate
from
maudite
the
taste
isnt
all
that
different
from
maudite
either
maybe
a
little
stronger
in
flavor
nice
fizzy
feeling
and
strong
lasting
flavors
notes
pass
on
it
there
are
better
belgians
out
there
and
many
of
them
are
made
by
unibroue
md
a
great
beer
the
smoothest
unibroue
offerign
ive
have
with
a
particularly
wet
finish
not
too
dry
spicy
or
overpowering
with
a
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
pours
a
soft
amber
if
a
little
cloudy
that
gives
a
generous
head
the
smell
is
full
of
lovely
yeast
phenols
and
light
sweet
malt
bits
lots
of
taste
seems
squeezed
into
the
beer
itself
and

melt
over
and
over
on
the
tongue
until
the
spit
dilutes
it

it

much
of
the

are
found
in

another
unibroue
success
i
would
consider
this
a
good
example
of
what
unibroue
does
it
was
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
best
before
73109
on
the
label
it
was
a
cloudy
redorange
color
with
a
medium
head
light
fruits
and
malt
in
the
aroma
it
tasted
the
same
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
a
nice
mellow
beer
fun
to
drink
overall
the
taste
of
cloves
is
fantastic
here
prominent
but
not
overbearing
on
the
other
qualities
of
the
beer
excellent
overall
but
im
a
huge
cloves
fan
pours
a
cloudy
red
amber
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
a
nice
looking
beer
with
very
good

good

beer
from
one
of

dating
the

went

i
love
the
style
so
a
well
done
version
like
this
one
really
makes
me
happy
happy
happy
well
done
and
well
worth
at
least
several
tries
a
keeper
of
brew
by
the
folks
at
unibroue
another
solid
belgian
thats
much
like
the
others
they
tend
to
make
im
not
an
expert
in
these
beers
but
its
a
treat
when
you
can
open
up
one
of
these
beauties
its
quality
stuff
mouthfeel
sweet
but
stern
in
the
belgian
tradiotons
smooth
and
medium
bodied
like
the
average
joes
belgian
from
belgium
if
that
makes
sense
overall
is
very
tasty
and
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
good
another
tasty
light
offering
from
unibroue
another
tasty
treat
from
unibrou
flavor
is
balanced
and
pleasant
the
citrus
sweetness
really
shines
in
this
brew
as
it
warmed
the
malt
profile
became
much
stronger
this
is
closer
to
a
belgian
pale
than
a
dark
in
my
opinion
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
with
a
roast
duck
over
christmas
very
nice
the
hazed
orange
body
is
capped
by
a
thick
frothy
white
head
it
has
great
retention
and
the
lace
patterns
are
intricate
and
full
aroma
is
fruity
yeasty
bready
and
cedary
carbonation
is
lively
on
the
tongue
maybe
a
bit
too
lively
body
is
about
lightmedium
taste
is
estery
and
fruity
a
little
of
that
bready
yeastiness
spicy
as
well
quite
delicate
and
simplistic
in
nature
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
if
the
price
is
low
id
buy
another
while
good
it
does
not
replace
my
other
more
preferred
brews
of
theirs
worth
a
try
driankability
is
only
average
the
yeast
content
just
overpowers
everything
i
can
only
pick
up
on
oak
flavors
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
will
be
a
once
and
done
which
is
very
disappointing
for
something
from
unibroue
slightly
hazed
in
the
center
toffee
orange
almost
peach
in
color
with
a
large
foamy
just
off
white
head
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
in
the
aroma
fruity
and
estery
bananas
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
and
dates
quite
sweet
and
juicy
the
flavor
was
almost
wheaty
and
zesty
i
think
from
the
spice
in
play
fruity
flavors
as
well
and
almost
a
candy
like
sweetness
hops
are
there
to
balance
and
accent
maybe
add
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
and
zest
pouring
the
second
half
of
the
750ml
bottle
the
belgian
yeast
and
banana
flavors
came
more
into
play
maybe
even
some
grapes
raisins
and
tangerines
the
candy
like
sweetness
persists
throughout
the
whole
beer
the
alcohol
is
there
and
noticeable
but
is
quite
gentil
no
kick
to
it
this
would
be
a
great
choice
to
pair
with
a
meal
or
dessert
last
swigs
a
black
liquorice
belgian
strong
with
frothy
feel
i
will
return
to
this
one
it
was
enchanting
overall
ok
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
unibroue
offerings
i
will
probably
try
this
again
at
some
point
down
the
road
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
thats
quite
a
name
and
a
challenge
to
pronounce
but
its
easy
enough
to
drink
a
little
sweeter
than
espected
the
spicy
ledge
counters
it
capably
and
quite
well
the
abv
is
notable
but
is
no
real
obstacle
so
the
thing
is
i
dont
have
to
say
it
even
correctly
i
just
have
to
drink
it
and
im
okay
with
that
pours
almost
exactly
the
color
of
apple
cider
cloudy
with
a
bonewhite
head
the
smell
is
very
earthy
and
sour
with
yeasty
esters
lots
of
bananalike
flavors
sweet
with
tartness
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
more
or
less
medium
and
alcohol
is
not
noticable
drinkability
is
fair
overall
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
a
dark
ale
because
there
are
no
typical
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
have
the
herbalgrass
or
spice
of
a
true
belgian
pale
ale
either
im
dont
think
either
are
the
intended
style
slàinte

some

flesh
fruit
and
slight

dryly
with
a

bitter
at
the
close
the
end
is
more
interesting
than
the
beginning
overall
slightly
overcarbonated
to
my
tastes
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
ale
but
not
great
i
dislike
the
metallic
sourness
to
the
beer
i
cant
pronounce
with
diction
or
cognition
it
appears
a
cloudy
amber
brown
deep
copper
tone
with
a
loarge
off
white
beige

forming

it
leaves

with

notes
as
well
as
a

note
bringing
floral
notes
with
sweet
spicy
christmas
bread
notes
quite
lively
overall
unibroue
always
impresses

with
full
on

tones
really
clovey
with

evident
yeasty

the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodie
ale
with

carbonation
while
the
spices
last
long
and
thick
on
the
palates
surface
drinkability
is
decent
althought
i
feel
this
would
greatly
improve
with
a
bit
of
age
on
each
bottle
i
love
unibroue
even
here
after
the
original
takeover
years
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
aroma
was
very
spicy
clove
pepper
anise
and
possibly
cinammon
in
the
nose
taste
was
also
very
spicy
but
with
quite
a
bit
of
fruit
mixed
in
tropical
fruitmango
banana
and
raisin
bready
flavors
along
with
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
make
for
an
easy
drinking
experience
alcohol
was
not
evident
in
aroma
or
taste
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
offering
from
unibroue
but
its
definitely
not
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
dunkelweizen
or
even
a
weizenbock
oh
well
belgian
style
beers
never
go
by
the
book
anyway
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
stylenice
and
cleanwith
a
pleasant
clove
presense
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
750

and
bailed

enjoyed
last
night
at
pazzos
with
the
owner
a
unibroue
representative
and
some
great
beer
enthusiasts
this
is
another
impressive
brew
from
unibroue
naturally
very
belgian
and
with
some
impressive
witlike
softness
strong
pale
and
wheat
malts

in
the

with
a
clean

quality

750
ml

the
brew
is
an
oranged
tea
color
two
fingers
of
very
light
tan
head
falls
to
around
a
finger
with
tons
of
chunky
lace
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
brew
is
very
hazy
and
the
carbonaion
is
moderate
aroma
is
a
little
light
there
are
nice
spicey
yeast
qualities
with
a
subtle
banana
estery
undetone
with
candied
sugar
sweet
tones
but
it
all
seems
a
little
distant
i
will
see
how
it
comes
through
with
more
time
to
warm
the
flavor
is
interesting
the
notes
from
the
aroma
are
all
there
with
a
nice
alcohol
spiceyness
that
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
the
banana
fruityness
blends
with
a
nice
raisiney
fruityness
to
really
give
a
nice
flavor
there
is
a
nice
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
from
noble
hop
lots
going
on
there
but
it
is
also
a
little
muted
just
like
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
very
strong
carbonation
this
one
has
a
really
nice
light
feel
for
a
pretty
strong
brew
overall
i
like
this
one
even
though
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
muted
it
still
conveys
a
good
deal
of
complexity
i
drank
a
lot
of
unibroue
in
last
six
months
and
never
saw
this
until
recently
so
naturally
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
poured
into
to
my
chimay
chalice
a
musty
reddish
amber
hue
with
high
lights
from
beneath
the
head
was
nice
and
white
leaving
wave
like
lacing
all
the
way
down
smelt
of
warm
bread
nice
fruit
esters
predominantly
banana
and
grapefruit
maybe
even
hints
of
apple
some
spice
and
belgian
yeast
tasted
so
smooth
on
the
tongue
velvety
with
hints
of
malt
a
nice
musty
thickness
wonderful
fruit
and
spice
pallet
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
warmth
only
felt
residually
but
completely
hidden
other
wise
definitely
a
belgian
style
brew
i
might
even
call
this
more
of
a
tripel
then
a
bspa
this
is
good
stuff
thanks
again
unibroue
id
get
it
again
from
the
bottle
a
dirty
copper
with
a
big
foamy
light
tan
head
aroma
citrus
caramel
brown
sugar
did
get
some
vanilla
flavor
a
light
sourness
malt
vanilla
alcohol
woody
with
some
smoke
yeast
citrus
leaning
toward
the
lemon
not
to
bad
will
get
more
medium
mouth
with
a
lot
of
well
placed
carbonation
one
of
the
most
drinkable
uni
beers
flavorful
but
with
a
low
enough
abv
to
keep
from
getting
sloppy
i
was
hoping
for
something
not
as
confused
as
the
chambly
niore
or
the
2005
and
was
rewarded
with
a
solid
uni
brew
that
i
will
revisit
for
sure
so
i
cant
belive
this
is
retired
slightly
cloudy
light
orangeamber
colour
with
a
rocky
light
beige
head
the
foam
quickly
dissipated
and
didnt
leave
anything
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
alcohol
bubblegum
light
pineapple
spices
clove
nutmeg
maybe
cinnamon
and
vanilla
very
nice
first
taste
what
the
hell
happened
a
thin
candy
sweetness
kicks
things
off
and
is
followed
by
an
overbearing
bitter
spiciness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
fortunately
a
bit
of
bready
yeasty
flavour
appears
towards
the
end
some
fruit
character
is
present
but
isnt
enough
to
balance
out
the
harshness
decent
texture
medium
bodied
slight
slickness
but
what
happened
to
the
flavour
what
a
surprise
after
sampling
the
delightful
and
complex
aroma
aint
it
just
like
a
blond
or
a
kolsch
light
creamy
and
citrus
orange
lemony
and
vanilla
and
banana
pear
yeast
and
light
spice
nicely
hopped
good
balance
however
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
scale
medium
mouthfeel
this
was
a
bottle
of
the
retired
version
had
the
new
version
and
it
was
more
yeast
and
metallic
maybe
would
get
the
same
rating
but
not
as
tasty
pours
a
cloudy
red
some
orange
on
the
edges
big
off
white
head
forms
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
citrus
and
spice
some
yeast
cork
and
bread
taste
is
sweet
up
front
some
citrus
and
yeast
little
bit
of
spice
really
heavy
on
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
little
bit
syrupy
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
can
definately
see
the
unibroue
slide
in
recent
times
light
orange
in
colour
with
strong
carbonation
fantastic
aromas
of
bready
malts
pears
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
both
caramel
and
bready
malts
make
an
appearance
in
the
mouth
along
with
more
complex
fruit
flavors
apple
pear
peach
and
orange
some
black
pepper
also
becomes
apparent
near
the
finish
along
with
some
drying
earthy
funk
great
stuff
the
taste
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
quiet
nice
and
i
like
that
the
sweetness
is
predominantly
held
in
check
which
really
lets
the
spicy
notes
to
come
through
this
is
really
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
in
the
end
it
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
level
set
by
the
opening
notes
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
quite
nice
in
the
end
a
unibroue
beer
which
is
not
too
widely
available
even
here
in
canada
thanks
to
duncan
for
sending
me
one
through
canbif
this
comes
like
most
other
unibroues
in
the
caged
and
corked
750ml
and
the
label
is
another
beauty
for
sure
very
pastoral
and
bucolic
showing
an
estate
beside
trees
and
the
lake
in
the
background
la
seigneuriale
poured
with
high
carbonation
after
uncorking
and
the
offwhite
head
fizzed
rapidly
until
little
was
left
on
top
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
beers
colour
is
hazy
tangerine
almost
light
strawberry
in
some
light
the
aroma
is
pretty
typically
unibroue
in
style
with
a
nice
fruitiness
yeasty
dryness
some
apple
and
citrus
and
a
generous
amount
of
malting
a
lot
of
apple
and
some
tanginess
along
with
cork
or
wood
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
unibroue
the
taste
is
light
giving
some
malts
up
front
dusty
yeast
in
the
middle
and
a
minty
taste
at
the
back
wood
tastes
are
also
quite
strong
the
beer
is
spritzy
on
the
tongue
making
it
a
little
champagnelike
medium
bodied
and
a
little
too
dusty
feeling
in
the
mouth
for
my
taste
this
beer
does
not
have
lot
of
complexity
for
unibroue
and
it
would
not
be
a
regular
purchase
of
mine
it
paired
very
well
with
gouda
cheese
drinkability
is
so
nice
that
its
hard
to
follow
up
with
anything
else
drinkability
it
is
a
ok
beer
and
very
typical
of
current
unibroue
products
maybe
they
should
take
more
risks
and
try
some
more
innovative
also
it
is
a
little
too
expensive
for
a
domestic
product
when
you
search
for
it
between
the
cheaper
macros
and
same
priced
imported
guys
from
what
i
remember
this
taste
a
tiny
wee
bit
of
what
the
real
seigneurial
used
to
be
a
loud
pop
rings
in
the
air
upon
opening
the
scent
wafts
through
in
the
wake
of
the
noise
faint
citrus
and
deep
nutty
aromas
establish
themselves
after
the
pour
the
head
falls
away
into
a
lively
reddish
brown
the
tingling
bubbles
are
followed
by
a
vague
spicy
taste
with
a
thick
taste
of
mild
cheese
overall
good
but
a
bit
bland
and
absentee
head
taste
the
palate
feels
like
a
split
between
a
maudite
and
either
a
hefeweizen
or
a
wit
almost
as
if
they
diluted
a
batch
of
maudite
with
a
little
blanche
de
chambly
so
it
had
wheaty
and
spicy
to
start
off
then
a
little
bread
and
an
alcoholic
finish
fans
of
unibroue
will
enjoy
those
who
think
the
recipies
are
getting
a
little
redundant
will
add
another
arrow
to
thier
quivers
goes
down
easy
appears
to
be
session
able
but
packs
a
wallop
overall
8
is
totally
hidden
i
can
see
why
they
named
this
after
the
devil
despite
my
appreciation
for
how
representative
it
appears
to
be
of
the
style
this
is
not
my
style
i
like
phenols
in
whisky
not
so
much
in
beer
i
took
note
to
leave
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
had
a
bad
experience
with
that
once
before
learned
by
lesson
o
a
classic
good
restaurants
should
have
this
beer
and
if
they
do
order
it
deceptively
higher
in
alcohol
is
the
trademark
of
the
belgian
brews
and
this
is
no
different
if
you
follow
the
instructions
of
the
brewery
its
recommended
to
leave
a
cm
of
liquid
in
the
settled
bottle
unless
you
like
the
taste
of
yeast
a
meal
in
a
glass
classic
so
much
fun
to
drink
one
of
my
favorites
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
of
white
fluffy
bubbles
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
overripe
apples
lemon
and
that
great
belgian
yeasty
funky
smell
taste
is
tart
and
lemony
with
some
nice
funk
up
front
and
i
get
some
apple
and
pear
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
with
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
this
is
just
an
outstanding
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
wellmade
beer
complex
and
enjoyable
im
glad
that
its
one
of
the
more
widely
available
belgian
beers
in
the
us
forget
miller
high
life
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
this
is
the
closest
thing
ive
ever
had
to
a
perfect
beer
also
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
is
unreal
pour
very
very
slowly
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
one
i
would
see
out
again
cool
that
you
get
a
glass
for
such
a
good
deal
and
easily
found
in
most
stores
that
sell
decent
beer
great
taste
but
not
the
best
great
if
there
is
no
other
option
poured
a
330
into
a
tulip
not
a
duvel
chalice
im
ok
with
that
this
was
a
bright
gold
with
a
giant
white
head
that
just
lasted
and
lasted
upon
settling
there
were
nice
lacings
floating
about
the
aroma
gave
spice
and
a
hint
of
the
tart
fruit
that
would
come
in
the
sip
the
flavor
was
a
neat
and
spicy
up
front
allowing
the
nose
to
influence
across
the
palate
there
was
a
nuanced
maltiness
so
slight
it
wasnt
biscuit
but
more
sourdough
bread
but
this
was
a
background
note
there
was
an
underlying
tone
of
european
less
belgian
it
finished
with
a
lovely
tartness
that
at
first
seemed
like
a
mild
citrus
but
upon
reflection
was
more
like
a
apple
or
pear
the
lager
people
would
say
crisp
some
reviews
mentioned
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
i
did
not
sense
that
s
being
of
note
even
though
it
is
an
8
5
pretty
big
bubbles
in
the
carbonation
which
gave
a
nice
complement
to
the
crispness
awfully
refreshing

an

5

love

my

and
what
a
treat
i
can
absolutely
understand
how
people
could
call
this
the
best
in
the
world
although
im
not
quite
there
tend
to
think
im
still
looking
its
beautiful
yelloworange
with
a
fluffy
head
and
clouds
up
just
a
tad
at
the
end
when
the
sedimentyeast
makes
it
out
on
the
last
drop
nice
citrus
and
floral
on
the
nose
but
the
yeast
really
steals
the
show
its
a
sweet
organic
scent
that
i
normally
wouldnt
call
appealing
but
this
just
seems
different
like
the
mastermind
behind
a
great
symphony
and
the
music
that
follows
is
special
bright
bubbly
and
complex
but
balanced
in
an
uncanny
way
didnt
realize
this
was
8
5
until
after
i
drank
it
youd
never
know
could
very
well
be
the
best
there
is
but
belgium
definitely
is
no
nonsense
belgisk
industri
ale
exceptional
beer
fruity
tart
and
looks
amazing
in
the

fruitiness

one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
dive
bar
amsterdam
drunk
football
hooligan
wont
go
away
and
getting
menacing
suddenly
its
sweetness
butterscotch
and
then
a
touch
of
citrus
its
good
its
really
good
its
my
first
duvel
and
im
an
instant
fan
can
you
be
a
beer
hooligan
stupid
question
better
than
expected
but
prefer
other
belgians
easy
drinking
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
overall
light
yet
savory
and
refreshing
a
belgian
masterpiece
pours
a
brilliant
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
aroma
is
very
citric
and
yeasty
taste
is
boozynot
a
bad
thing
in
this
beer
hay
like
and
yeasty
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
mouthfeel
feel
lightmedium
and
very
carbonated
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
drinks
easy
but
is
easy
to
savour
i
can
see
why
it
is
held
in
such
high
esteem
o
very
good
beer
not
what
i
usually
look
for
but
its
great
good
beerbad
game
would
rather
spend
the
whole
night
out
in
the
cold
pulling
sludge
at
a
waste
water
plant
than
see
a
game
like
that
one
again
the
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
sometime
soon
the
gamei
would
like
erased
from
my
memory
banks
forever
top
notch
this
is
an
example
of
why
our
friends
in
belgium
have
their
deserved
reputation
woah
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
never
gave
it
the
chance
because
i
thought
it
would
be
significantly
less
refreshing
and
never
was
too
keen
on
the
bottle
shape
i
could
not
be
more
incorrect
refreshing
carbonated
and
perfectly
balanced
into
a
magnificent
ale
that
bursts
with
flavors
the
drinkability
is
phenomenal
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
perfectly
pretty
good
price
too
i
will
absolutely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
when
i
run
out
i
can
easily
see
why
the
duvel
is
enjoyed
by
so
many
for
its
remarkable
balance
and
craft
one
of
the
best
pale
ale
ever
tasted
pours
with
a
very
large
white
head
has
a
beautiful
golden
color
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
sweetness
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
a
perfect
golden
ale
v
quite
expensive
at
15
dollars
a
four
pack
heavy
on
the
alcohol
yet
light
yet
satisfying
an
unlikely
contradiction
that
is
so
true
you
have
to
taste
it
simple
ingredients
with
deep
complexity
epic
head
if
poured
correctly
the
last
sip
of
beer
will
be
all
foam
and
itll
get
you
buzzed
in
a
hurry
overall
incredibly
well
crafted
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
8
5
but
drinks
like
a
session
ale
is
awesome
in
and
of
itself
delicious
and
beautiful
i
would
recommend
this
100
hard
to
rate
as
i
have
encountered
problems
recently
two
cases
recently
have
each
contained
several
bottles
which
were
bad
you
can
tell
them
as
soon
as
opened
they
start
to
overflow
the
bottle
and
are
so
overcarbonated
you
can
barely
get
them
into
a
glass

this

one
i
recommend
everyone
to
try
once
in
their
life
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
aged
this
beer
for
just
over
a
year
to
see
how
it
turned
out
while
very
similar
to
the
original
it
has
more
yeastiness
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
almost
a
slight
funk
to
it
not
in
a
bad
way
however
it
doesnt
change
enough
to
warrant
the
year
of
aging
but
it
was
still
fun
to
try

looking

not

for

wise

but
its
not
something
i
would
get
again
i
read
a
lot
of
reviews
on
this
so
i
had
to
try
it
overall
normally
im
focused
on
the
malthop
ratio
this
beer
however
is
a
different
animal
the
interplay
between
the
fruit
sour
and
spice
flavors
make
for
a
unique
experience
eminently
drinkable
despite
the
rather
high
alcohol
content
a
yeasty
sweetness
is
paired
with
spices
and
pepper
creating
a
crisp
vivid
mouthfeel
with
a
refreshing
and
still
peppery
aftertaste
complex
and
challenging
at
first
impression
the
various
flavors
seem
to
collide
but
they
all
end
up
in
a
very
well
composed
beer
with
gentle
sweetness
and
complex
body
reminds
me
of
summer
sun
fresh
cut
grass
and
flowers
very
easy
to
drink
despite
its
85
volume
in
it
classic
o
really
tasty
packs
quite
a
punch
and
can
quickly
make
you
rather
buzzed
because
of
the
high
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
brew

very
boozy

the

pours
a
cloudy

head
that
trails
the
glass
smells
of
banana

wheat
while
having
a
good
amount
of
hops
on
the
back
end
the
taste
is
sweet
in
the
beginning
and
then
transfers
to
more
earthy
tones
before
a
crisp
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
must
try
for
me
this
is
quite
possibly
as
close
to
perfection
as
a
beer
can
get
its
beauty
and
quality
is
subtle
and
not
easy
to
discern
for
the
non
experts
the
first
sip
feels
heavily
carbonated
and
one
might
be
tempted
to
wonder
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
however
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
sipped
slowly
after
a
while
as
the
carbonation
settles
and
the
beer
warms
up
the
taste
becomes
more
pronounced
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
snifter
glass
you
feel
a
poignant
sadness
that
it
is
all
about
to
end
the
taste
is
so
unique
it
feels
like
you
are
drinking
a
white
wine
at
times
the
alcoholic
content
is
high
yet
the
flavor
is
so
clean
and
the
taste
so
pure
i
didnt
even
feel
a
buzz
i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
it
is
a
taste
i
will
dream
about
and
think
about
for
a
while
the
flavor
is
a
crisp
fruity
blend
with
an
undercurrent
of
black
pepper
and
a
surprisingly
sweet
finish
feels
light
and
sharp
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
unique
and
complex
tasting
brew

should
try

one
of
the
timeless
classics
of
the
beer
world
was
skeptical
at
first
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
that
its
very
good
very
simple
flavor
i
would
say
pear

with
a
bitter

taste
no
complex

just
pear
like
no

either
overall
this
is
worth
the
price
and
hype
truly
outstanding
in
all
aspects
overall
i
would
much
prefer
a
chimay
to
this
one
especially
since
either
one
will
set
you
back
a
few
extra
bucks
decent
enough
but
just
not
that
special
o
great
beer
i
think
i
ruined
it
to
start
with
because
it
was
too
cold
right
out
of
the
fridge
the
musty
flavor
overpowered
the
beer
at
low
temperature
while
the
other
flavors
receded
once
it
warmed
up
it
rounded
out
beautifully
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
refreshing
crisp
flavor
packed
and
easy
drinking
even
at
8
5
i
cannot
get
enough
of
this
beer
the
color
is
golden
and
clear
the
head
is
white
and
thick
what
brings
me
back
to
this
beer
is
the
taste
it
is
just
perfect
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
just
begs
to
have
two
or
three
per
sitting
i
wish
i
could
stock
this
beer
in
my
kegertor
as
previously
mentioned
the
head
on
this
beer
is
just
beautiful
although
for
me
it
did
not
last
as
long
as
it
seems
to
have
for
others
pure
white
fluffy
initially
three
fingers
high
but
fading
to
one
finger
and
then
just
a
ring
after
a
few
minutes
although
the
carbonation
was
superb
and
lasted
the
entire
time
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
rich
golden
orange
in
the
glass
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
spicy
and
hoppier
than
the
flavor
seems
to
be
until
you
get
to
the
pleasant
lingering
tartness
at
the
finish
this
beer
was
challenging
in
a
good
way
as
it
has
so
much
going
on
i
found
it
much
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
a
bit
since
i
think
i
served
it
a
bit
too
cold
initially
the
flavor
is
yeasty
and
spicy
with
some
fruit
but
not
too
much
sweetness
and
a
tangy
bite
in
the
finish
would
cheerfully
have
again
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
am
looking
forward
to
my
darkbeerobsessed
husband
to
try
this
golden
ale
and
see
how
complex
and
rich
a
golden
ale
can
be
lots
of
carbonation
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
my
mark
out
of
100
would
93
overall
we
all
know
that
duvel
is
one
of
those
classics
that
work
whenever
and
wherever
cool
summer
nights
or
by
the
fireplace
in
the
dead
of
winter
a
true
classic
however
i
felt
that
it
was
missing
an
extra
something
to
be
fair
i
will
stand
behind
duvel
as
one
of
the
cantgowrong
beers
but
if
only
it
had
an
extra
bit
of
oomph
o
excellent
tripel
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
duvel
and
was
happy
to
hear
that
it
lived
up
to
its
hype

it

you

it

there
is
little
to
say
about
an
ale
that
is
in
many
ways
the
faultless
platonic
ideal
of
the
style
although
my
personal
tastes
leave
me
wanting
more
complexity
and
i
prefer
the
tripelhop
by
a
substantial
margin
or
even
some
of
the
domestic
takes
on
an
imperial
pilsner
a
style
clearly
influenced
by
duvel
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
that
should
be
shared
with
funny
friends
and
people
who
appreciate
a
good
beer
also
drink
before
you
start
on
the
tequila
o
one
of

best

on

its

with

shop
this
is
not
something
id
revisit
very
often
at
all
i
was
tiptoeing
around
it
at
the
store
but
finally
took
the
plunge
is
it
a
good
beer
oh
without
a
doubt
is
it
worth
that
price
nope
its
a
tasty
clean
refreshing
surprisingly
high
abv
beer
that
id
probably
recommend
anyone
to
try
at
least
a
bottle
of
though
definitely
recommend
and
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
o
wow
nice
complex
ale
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
and
a
very
light
color
nice
white
head
a
very
clear
beer
and
a
nice
belgian
taste
is
quite
dry
but
surprisingly
refreshing
and
hides
its
8
5
abv
very
well
a
great
beer
from
duvel
that
i
will
buy
again
i
am
a
big
ipa
drinker
and
this
beer
has
me
considering
checking
out
more
belgians
for
the
first
time
i
wont
say
its
the
best
golden
out
there
i
havent
tried
them
all
and
if
anything
this
is
a
bit
atypical
dry
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
classic
one
of
those
beers
every
beer
drinker
should
try
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
no
need
to
state
the
obvious
its
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
authentic
belgian
really
earthy
and
spicy
perfectly
balanced
and
drinkable
its
character
is
pretty
ordinary
doesnt
have
any
extra
added
bonus
flavors
like
lime
or
hints
of
citrus
like
i
got
from
damnation
its
just
perfectly
balanced
and
earthy
natural
i
first
had
a
duvel
a
few
years
ago
because
i
heard
it
was
considered
one
of
the
must
try
beers
i
tried
it
and
found
it
mediocre
on
all
levels
i
figured
i
must
be
missing
something
if
many
beer
experts
including
michael
jackson
consider
this
one
of
their
favorite
beers
i
like
many
belgian
ales
and
thought
maybe
my
palette
just
wasnt
developed
enough
to
appreciate
the
subtle
nuisances
of
this
beer
three
years
and
over
a
thousand
beers
later
i
now
appreciate
a
wide
spectrum
of
styles
and
my
palette
has
definitely
advanced
duvel
however
hasnt
changed
for
me
i
find
that
the
high
carbonation
deters
from
my
enjoyment
the
high
alcohol
content
which
i
usually
find
as
a
plus
takes
away
from
the
taste
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
nothing
special
sometimes
i
feel
that
some
beers
get
rated
high
because
of
the
buzz
over
it
for
example
i
was
at
russian
river
six
weeks
ago
and
had
a
pliny
the
elder
good
ipa
not
great
ive
had
many
ipas
that
are
better
again
all
about
the
hype
tastes
like
honey
nut
cheerios
feels
like
heaven
very
sweet
with
undertones
of
cinnamon
a
crispy
and
crackling
body
incredibly
easy
to
quaff
it
only
gets
better
with
warming
so
theres
no
need
to
hurry
but
its
so
hard
to
drink
slowly
when
its
this
good
the
quintessential
craft
beer
conundrum
o
again
belgium
gets
me
going
i
dont
know
that
this
could
be
better
in
some
respects
scent
to
taste
ratio
could
be
much
better
had

this

and
easy

why
it
is
the
standard
for
the
style
while
not
something
i
usually
go
for
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
was
worried
from
the
first
sniff
that
i
wouldnt
like
this
i
thought
it
would
be
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
but
it
definitely
is
not
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
a
beer
that
is
good
because
there
is
not
that
big
punch
of
flavor
just
a
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
beer
well
worth
the
try
and
the
hype
o
absolutely
awesome
i
cant
believe
i
would
bypass
this
all
the
time
i
paired
this
with
a
nice
sirloin
and
it
complemented
it
perfectly
abv
isnt
noticed
much
by
me
wonderful
o
not
really

im

a
fine
lager
served
in
a

conditioned
with

a

in

o
this
is
a
beer
in
a
style
all
of
its
own
and
extremely
unique
extremely
pale
very
high
carbonation
high
abv
and
the
balance
of
the
duvel
yeast
make
this
beer
in
a
league
of
its
own
it
is
also
the
experience
of
drinking
it
out
of
the
proper
duvel
glass
that
enhances
it
as
well
we
all
know
the
best
beer
is
more
then
just
the
beer
but
the
entire
experience
well
done
this
very
young
effort
pairs
well
with
sushi
like
pizza
sushi
is
adaptable
and
ready
for
your
own
touches
i
tried
spicy
tuna
homemade
rolls
drinking
the
duvel
with
homemade
belgian
fries
perfect
o
as
ive
been
delving
deeper
into
the
world
of
beer
belgian
strong
pales
have
been
dropping
farther
and
farther
down
on
my
list
of
preferred
styles
so
admittedly
ive
been
slacking
on
duvel
as
i
sit
here
typing
this
conclusion
sipping
the
last
few
ounces
im
metaphorically
slapping
myself
in
the
face
for
putting
this
brew
off
for
so
long
you
know
you
have
something
special
on
your
hands
when
youre
utterly
dumbfounded
by
how
good
a
brew
is
regardless
of
the
fact
that
its
a
style
youre
not
fond
of
duvel
is
the
top
of
the
line
it
is
the
beallendall
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
is
the
gold
standard
in
which
every
bspa
aspires
to
be
if
youre
looking
for
the
definitive
look
no
further
duvel
is
here
to
satisfy
as
alstrom
wrote
close
to
champagne
but
so
much
more
o
good
variety
of
flavors
just
a
shame
that
nasty
grain
was
the
most
prominent
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
got
it
on
sale
at
10
a
4
pack
regular
price
it
15
a
4
pack
which
is
a
bit
pricy
however
for
the
occasional
treat
i
think
its
worth
the
splurge
o
this
is
a
remarkable
beer
and
i
was
both
grateful
to
try
it
and
optimistic
that
ill
find
it
again

overall
an

that
i
would
never
turn
down
uma
cerveja
muito
famosa
e
de
qualidade
acredito
que
se
ela
fosse
uma
simples
belgian
blond
ale
mereceria
mais
pontos
mas
pelo
fato
de
ser
uma
strong
ela
poderia
ser
mais
aromática
e
possuir
um
aroma
um
pouco
mais
complexo
porém
mesmo
assim
é
uma
ótima
cerveja
vale
a
pena
conferir
duvel
is
pretty
close
to
my
palates
perfect
beer
duvel
is
real
juggernaut
of
belgian
pale
ale
candi
sugar
and
pilsner
blend
together
boost
up
the
alcohol
but
thanks
to
two
stage
yeast
additions
there
comes
across
a
clean
very
dry
finish
with
glorious
head
retention
its
a
devil
of
beer
and
a
world
class
one
too
nearly
full
bodied
with
a
lighter
effervescence
which
comes
across
quite
tart
warming
with
a
slight
cleanliness
to
the
finish
this
brew
is
world
class
not
just
in
its
style
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
in
a
variety
of
beer
settings
sessions
hot
days
cold
days
its
just
a
really
versatile
feel
as
far
as
flavors
and
feel
goes
im
going
to
try
to
keep
some
of
these
in
the
fridge
pours
a

lots

not
too
boozy
in
the
mouth
given
the
8

but
notice
it
in
the
throat
after
a
few
minutes
o
one
of
the
more
popular
tripelstrong
pale
ale
beers
available
in
the
us
the
high
alcohol
content
and
drinkability
are
nice
and
make
it
a
must
buy
if
searching
for
a
solid
belgium
ale
b
overall
4
0
great
beer
but
i
found
it
a
bit
off
in
several
vital
categories
smell
was
far
too
subdued
for
the
style
and
the
taste
was
too
bland
and
generic
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
belgian
i
e
a
big
hit
of
malt
or
hops
or
spicy
yeast
instead
i
am
left
thinking
that
duvel
is
the
lagerdrinkers
belgian
ale
not
that
this
is
bad
its
just
that
to
me
duvel
is
a
bit
dialed
down
for
the
international
market
again
just
my
opinion
and
this
is
not
to
say
that
i
would
not
buy
duvel
again
i
would
certainly
recommended
if
you
have
not
had
it
before
had
2
bottles
a
very
thick
foamy
head
with
sticky
lacing
very
pale
yellow
in
color
aroma
taste
are
the
same
comes
across
as
sweet
yet
malty
wheat
alcohol
i
find
that
the
sweetness
seems
to
dominate
over
the
slight
light
bitterness
very
crisp
light
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
been
a
while
since
i
last
drank
this
one
finally
returned
to
it
last
night
and
very
glad
i
did
pours
a
light
yellowish
golden
with
a
big
off
white
head
aroma
offers
some
nice
super
balanced
spiciness
from
the
yeast
nice
bright
lemon
rind
and
some
grassiness
flavor
follows
suit
mouthfeel
was
active
and
on
the
thinner
side
overall
a
great
beer
not
really
a
fan
of
too
many
golden
ales
but
am
definitely
a
fan
of
this
one
such
a
well
constructed
beer
wow
damn
good
belgian
beer
very
straight
forward
beer
produces
excellent
beer
burps
many
qualities
of
champagne
o
the
one
other
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
hated
it
tasting
this
again
i
dont
know
how
i
ever
could
this
is
definitely
the
belgian
strong
pale
benchmark
a
classic
and
would
be
a
great
introduction
for
someone
to
belgian
beer
a
pale
golden
colored
with
an
inch
of
tightly
woven
brussels
lace
at
the
top
serious
carbonation
bubble
action
going
on
here
smell
is
mineral
like
along
with
saaz
styrian
golding
hops
light
belgian
candy
sugar
is
also
detectable
within
the
mouth
is
crispdryand
refreshing
this
is
like
belgian
ale
candy
sugar
and
brussels
lace
meets
czech
pilsner
hops
and
crispness
edit
to
above
tried
my
second
bottle
this
stuff
is
fantastic
still
cant
get
over
the
visual
of
bubbles
coming
up
forever
highly
recommended
assuming
i
didnt
get
a
bad
batch
or
a
bottle
from
a
case
left
outside
for
a
week
in
summer
i
expected
more
to
the
nose
and
tongue
this
beer
lacked
the
belgian
flavors
of
other
golden
ales
and
tasted
very
much
like
a
high
gravity
slightly
more
flavorful
corona
i
seriously
considered
finding
a
lime
i
might
try
again
in
the
future
but
for
now
i
cant
say
i
like
it
at
all
o
one
of
the
best
known
beers
fur
surein
the
old
way
m
carbonation
dancing
on
the
tongue
dry
crisp
clean
champagne
like
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
there
is
a
reason
that
duvel
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
the
wellrounded
profile
makes
the
higher
price
of
au130
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
bottles
2013
worth
it
once
every
now
and
then
or
perhaps
a
4pack
for
us
peasants
had
a
bottle
decanted
into
a
genuine
duvel
goblet
at
1410
bier
haus
in
calgary
this
classic
worldrenowned
brew
pours
a
lemondrop
bright
yellow
with
the
oftcited
bright
white
head
that
forms
a
nighimpenetrable
cap
that
bottlenecks
right
at
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
protrudes
a
bit
over
said
rim
without
spilling
a
majestic
sight
exudes
an
aroma
of
fruity
yeast
and
very
clean
pale
malt
some
green
apple
and
saaz
hop
perfume
palate
is
quite
crisp
and
dry
but
with
some
residual
sugars
and
a
lot
of
fruit
apples
pears
and
a
little
banana
perhaps
white
sugar
candied
ginger
citrus
pith
and
white
pepper
spice
against
a
backdrop
of
floral
perfumed
lemon
cake
a
large
bloom
of
alcohol
along
with
noticeable
saaz
hops
finish
is
bitter
with
a
little
cork
clean
without
noticeably
funky
flavors
hard
to
argue
that
this
isnt
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
it
is
the
original
after
all
and
the
intent
to
to
yield
something
clean
and
crisp
perhaps
less
complex
in
terms
of
yeastderived
spicy
ester
profile
than
some
similar
beers
prost
o
great
balance
and
very
complex
it
seems
to
have
it
all
pear
spice
and
some
hops
o
glad
to
say
i
had
it
but
ill
take
russian
river
damnation
or
delirium
tremens
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
im
curious
if
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
something
the
best
by
date
indicated
i
had
9
months
left
o
this
isnt
my
first
duvel
just
the
first
time
i
decided
to
review
it
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
the
typical
belgian
style
i
will
continue
to
keep
it
in
my
rotation
prost
pours
bright
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
carbonation
is
heavy
with
a
lasting
frothy
head
and
champaign
like
bubbles
tracing
up
the
center
a
nice
sour
tart
crisp
ale
top
notch
beer
lacing
is
rediculis
down
the
glass
pilsner
malt
is
very
up
front
and
well
placed
dry
finish
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
a
slightly
sour
super
pilsner
i
am
impressed
its
worth
the
16
bucks
a
four
pack
price
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
fruit
especially
banana
and
berries
with
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
cirtis
banana
berries
and
light
grain
beer
is
light
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
pricey
potentially
my
new
favorite
otherwise
one
of
if
the
not
the
standard
bearer
for
this
style
when
you
pour
it
a
truly
beautiful
bloom
emerges
i
always
take
a
spoon
or
a
finger
and
try
some
of
the
froth
before
drinking
the
texture
is
buttery
slightly
acidic
and
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
style
while
high
in
alcoholic
content
the
floral
aromas
and
delicate
flavors
cloud
the
abv
so
much
that
trouble
can
ensue
if
one
is
not
careful
slight
notes
of
apple
and
stronger
notes
of
orange
emerge
especially
if
this
classic
is
not
served
too
cold
where
i
live
costco
often
has
it
in
stock
for
only
10
overall
this
is
a
great
golden
ale
it
can
be
expensive
and
is
usually
cheaper
to
buy
as

instead
of
in
the
750ml
3l
bottles
which
range
from

it
is
a
beer
you
want
to
take
your
time
to
enjoy
as
it
boasts
a
8
5
abv
as
well
it
has
a
very
fine
fruity
flavor
to
it
the
amout
of
foam
that
comes
with
this
drink
is
something
i
didnt
care
for
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
i
would
recommend
that
you
drink
this
belgian
ale
in
the
proper
glassware
in
other
words
use
a
chalice
glass
it
will
brining
out
the
fruit
like
smell
that
duvel
has
and
add
to
the
experience
o
about
what
one
would
expect
of
a
good
belgian
golden
ale
quite
drinkable
with
enough
yeasty
fruity
zing
to
keep
it
interesting
i
get
the
feeling
im
drinking
it
in
the
wrong
season
though
it
would
probably
be
a
very
fine
summer
refresher
but
the
amazing
part
of
this
beer
is
that
8
5
alcohol
tastes
more
like
4
someone
who
didnt
know
better
might
take
it
for
a
sessionable
brew
this
rating
is
for
a
good
batch
of
duvel
note
for
anyone
saying
it
has
a
lemon
taste
to
it
that
is
a
bad
batch
it
is
not
supposed
to
taste
sour
at
all
if
it
hasnt
gone
bad
duvel
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
period
but
is
not
supposed
to
taste
sour
to
the
slightest
degree
and
this
is
a
big
problem
with
a
lot
of
premium
european
beers
sold
in
the
us
at
least
in
the
flyover
states
o
a
great
summertime
belgian
again
this
is
a
very
focused
and
sharp
belgian
ale
enjoy
had
it
with
a
grilld
ribeye
and
it
was
the
perfect
pairing
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
clean
and
crisp
has
a
golden
color
with
very
nice
head
retention
the
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
in
this
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
non
trappist
belgians
has
a
nice
citrus
hint
to
it
not
as
foggy
as
most
belgian
beers
i
really
dont
know
what
else
to
say
except
try
this
one
you
will
be
thankful
this
was
a
very
pleasant
revisit
havent
had
this
since
maybe
2005
or
so
and
it
is
way
better
than
i
remember
it
i
say
give
it
a
shot
if
its
your
first
time
having
it
and
if
you
havent
had
it
in
a
while
try
it
again
you
may
enjoy
it
way
more
overall
an
easy
drinking
classic
that
still
delivers
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
ben
franklin
once
said
beer
is
proof
that
god
loves
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
and
that
sentiment
certainly
applies
to
this
beer
overall
this
beer
hits
you
pretty
hard
and
i
could
see
why
it
has
such
a
following
but
i
dont
think
i
will
get
it
again
not
really
that
special
o
took
me
a
while
to
try
this
not
really
sure
why
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgian
ales
but
this
along
w
a
few
of
the
unibroue
belgians
are
outstanding
representation
of
the
styles
i
really
like
the
malt
in
this
brew
and
the
dark
fruit
isnt
as
noticeable
in
this
one
which
is
good
i
think
the
dark
fruit
in
some
belgians
can
make
the
beer
winelike
which
i
do
not
care
for
overall
an
excellent
belgian
strong
that
i
look
forward
to
sampling
again
this
might
be
my
favorite
belgian
beer
the
look
the
aroma
the
taste
are
all
spectacular
while
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
beer
this
is
high
on
the
list
this
is
a
top
five
beer
for
me
personally
this
is
a
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
well
this
is
an
excellent
golden
ale
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
taste
and
flavor
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
the
duvel
made
me
do
it
reviewed
101007
mouthfeel
dont
generally
have
much
to
say
about
mouthfeel
but
this
is
something
else
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
finish
not
noteworthy
in
and
of
itself
given
the
style
but
its
also
pretty
creamy
and
incredibly
dry
just
wonderful
overall
a
really
really
good
belgian
pale
ale
and
easy
to
find
so
give
it
a
try
o
outstanding
bellwether
example
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
o
good
beer
good
complexity
refreshing
and
full
at
the
same
time
o
a
wonderful
beer
top
class
is
all
i
can
say
i
was
really
excited
to
open
this
and
try
it
until
i
opened
it
to
try
it
first
thing
was
the
abundance
of
skunk
smell
luckily
the
appearance
was
nice
and
the
flavor
was
nowhere
near
the
smell
not
sure
if
it
was
suppose
to
smell
like
that
but
i
am
willing
to
try
it
again
overall
although
somewhat
light
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
iffy
in
terms
of
appearance
the
taste
serves
as
a
paradigm
for
beers
with
yeast
malt
and
hops
together
in
perfect
harmony
this
beverage
is
what
you
use
to
silence
a
friend
who
demands
to
know
what
good
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
golden
orange
colored
beer
with
a
white
everlasting
compact
foam
a
delightful
for
your
sight
looking
it
to
reflected
light
hoppy
and
intense
fruity
aromawonderful
its
taste
is
malty
sweet
very
complex
very
pleasant
even
though
is
high
in
alcohol
content
it
is
well
hidden
to
your
palate
medium
bodied
very
smoth
mouthfeel
fantastic
beer
overall
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
definitely
would
drink
it
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
or
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
overall
i
have
had
duvel
god
knows
how
many
times
and
never
gave
this
beer
a
proper
review
up
until
today
borderline
perfect
and
usually
a
steady
for
me
preferably
in
the
summer
because
of
its
citrus
background
one
of
the
best
go
tos
you
will
ever
have
grab
a
glass
and
enjoy
salud
if
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
the
balance
the
taste
the
appearance
its
perfect
duvel
wins
beer
the
oft
overlooked
duvel
really
a
fine
beer
glowing
crystalclear
golden
body
huge
white
foam
and
a
lingering
cloud
another
classic
sharp
carbonation
but
a
nice
body
for
something
that
appears
so
light
light
bitterness
lemon
rind
hoppy
peppery
european
hops
a
nice
one
bottle
pours
to
my
tremens
tulip
light
clear
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
funk
hay
hops
and
light
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
dry
and
effervescent
hay
and
honey
light
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
while
i
like
others
like
piraat
a
bit
better
than
this
one
it
is
an
excellent
choice
and
could
be
enjoyed
in
any
occasion
or
weather
o
theres
a
reason
why
its
rightfully
touted
as
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
the
perfect
balance
drinking
this
without
prior
knowledge
of
its
abv
you
would
never
guess
that
its
a
robust
8
5
belgian
pale
ale
excellent
beer
in
every
way
likely
worthy
of
a
straight
five
rating
across
the
board
i
like
to
think
there
is
a
white
whale
out
there
somewhere
though
this
is
what
beer
should
be
encompasses
everything
that
makes
us
love
beer
whatever
its
style
bought
this
in
a
box
of
3
750ml
bottles
been
eying
it
for
a
while
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
bottle
conditioned
and
as
this
is
the
3rd
of
the
3
all
have
been
slightly
different
this
the
most
funky
of
the
bunch
pours
dark
gold
thick
head
fades
fairly
quickly
aroma
has
a
slightly
stale
moldy
essence
there
is
a
twang
to
it
like
budweiser
with
corriander
dryhopped
and
that
is
exactly
it
an
upscale
and
expensive
bud
that
has
gone
bad
i
dont
mind
a
little
skunk
in
a
green
bottle
lager
but
this
was
intentional
and
went
horribly
wrong
they
tried
to
high
end
this
and
screwed
up
when
it
could
have
been
a
decent
and
drinkable
mile
golden
ale
like
a
homebrew
experiment
that
failed
never
again
overall
i
dont
know
whats
up
but
im
not
terribly
impressed
by
this
oftloved
beer
o
i
think
my
sample
may
have
had
a
hard
life
in
its
journey
between
the
brewer
and
my
glass
o
this
is
one
of
the
all
time
greats
a
classic
for
the
ages
an
absolute
musttry
there
really
isnt
much
to
think
about
if
you
really
dissect
this
beer
but
its
greatness
is
derived
from
its
perfect
balance
and
legendary
drinkability
fruits
engage
the
palate
and
the
sour
makes
the
mouth
water
the
light
grain
malt
sways
and
bends
across
the
tongue
for
a
feeling
that
is
light
and
refreshing
the
champagne
bubbles
tickle
you
and
the
dry
finish
is
complimentary
there
is
a
touch
more
alcohol
than
you
might
at
first
realize
and
that
is
ticklish
too
and
makes
you
smile
as
it
warms
you
the
pear
comes
out
more
and
the
grainy
malt
starts
fluffy
but
then
deepens
slightly
to
remind
you
of
a
still
life
painting
with
fruit
and
bread
and
cheese
this
is
a
work
of
art
radiant
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
captivating
very
good
pale
ale
i
would
especially
recommend
this
to
people
who
are
just
exploring
more
exotic
beers
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
as
listed
and
just
go
by
the
overall
total
overall
impression
a
straight
forward
no
holds
barred
belgian
strong
blonde
ale
classic
nothing
too
fancy
about
it
just
pure
belgian
brewing
at
its
best
and
most
delicate
duvel
may
be
standardsetting
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
its
also
unique
easily
my
favorite
european
beer
long
been
my
favorite
beer
high
abv
but
not
overwhelming
soft
mouthfeel
due
to
fine
carbonation
nice
consistent
taste
not
overstated
dangerous
because
it
is
one
of
the
few
high
abv
belgians
you
can
drink
multiplies
of
without
getting
tired
of
it
it
doesnt
get
better
than
this
that
stylistic
moniker
was
appropriate
for
this
as
this
was
quite
strong
and
took
a
while
to
fully
enjoy
and
savor
because
the
carbonation
was
so
persistent
and
easily
discerned
this
felt
like
a
champagne
squared
by
the
time
i
finished
it
off
although
this
isnt
a
type
of
beer
that
i
prefer
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
the
standard
by
with
all
other
beers
of
this
style
are
measured
up
against
dancing
with
the
devil
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
all
beer
lovers
out
to
give
this
a
try
to
see
if
theyre
up
for
handling
it
since
this
is
one
brew
that
deserves
a
try
by
all
nice
parisian
cheap
brew
á
votre
santé
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
ive
had
more
than
of
a
few
of
this
style
and
this
beer
seems
to
do
the
best
job
at
showing
what
this
style
is
really
about
and
all
the
aspects
of
it
seems
to
be
balanced
nicely
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
it
would
be
nice
to
drink
a
few
of
these
during
the
summer
but
the
price
prevents
me
from
doing
so
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
and
balanced
it
was
and
the
appearance
was
also
very
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
its
a
very
high
quality
beer
but
i
still
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
thats
the
only
downfall
with
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
often
because
of
its
price
this
would
have
to
be
a
once
in
a
while
beer
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
pale
ales
its
a
very
good
and
true
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
had
some
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
since
its
highly
regarded
and
it
met
my
expectations
nicely
and
i
think
this
beer
gets
all
the
respect
it
deserves
it
made
for
a
good
fist
impression
and
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
some
different
duvel
beers
great
job
guys
so
far
there
is
no
doubt
that
is
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pale
ale
generally
im
pretty
much
in
agreement
with
beeradvocate
o
i
usually
dont
like
beers
with
funky
yeast
but
this
beer
kept
it
low
decently
tasty
coming
from
a
person
who
usually
doesnt
like
these
kinds
of
beers
aroma
taste
sharp
smell
and
taste
to
it
acidic
beer
has
an
average
length
of
finish
and
contains
slight
grapefruit
and
herbal
notes
also
has
a
slight
spice
to
it
along
with
some
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
dry
crisp
and
leaves
the
palate
wishing
for
more
duvel
is
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
appearance
is
a
yellow
or
goldenrod
color
the
smells
contain
both
wheat
and
fruit
notes
the
body
was
very
full
bodied
and
bold
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
bold
with
strong
wheat
notes
this
was
my
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
style
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
high
carbonation
easy
to
drink
hides
the
strength
very
well
overall
this
is
a
dangerous
8
5
beer
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
underneath
a
wonderfully
crisp
flavor
that
leaves
you
wanting
just
one
more
sip
one
of
my
many
goto
beers
for
warm
summer
months
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
large
tulip
glass
at
the
pantry
on
41613
the
beer
pours
a
glossy
yellowgold
like
very
fine
jewelry
with
an
eruption
of
rocky
white
head
the
head
retains
for
most
of
the
life
of
the
glass
of
beer
and
leaves
streaks
of
fine
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
light
penetration
is
pretty
good
though
there
is
a
little
haze
from
the
pour
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
phenomenal
and
by
far
the
highlight
of
the
beer
there
is
hoards
of
bright
fruit
notes
and
esters
that
seem
to
jump
out
of
the
glass
at
first
you
are
hit
with
lots
of
ripe
banana
peel
and
candied
sugar
drops
there
is
a
good
spicy
hop
aroma
that
lingers
along
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
and
you
give
it
a
nice
swirm
bright
and
fresh
lemons
come
out
as
well
the
malt
is
present
too
with
a
little
soft
bready
smell
as
well
the
8
5
alcohol
is
nowhere
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
with
fresh
fruit
especially
golden
raisins
dates
and
a
touch
of
maybe
some
cherries
as
well
i
tend
to
think
of
the
cherry
flavor
in
sour
beers
but
this
is
more
of
the
sweet
side
of
the
cherry
flavor
the
hops
are
present
earthy
and
spicy
very
much
like
a
noble
hopped
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
overlydry
almost
like
something
produced
from
a
champagne
yeast
though
i
have
no
clue
if
it
is
used
in
this
brew
but
otherwise
has
great
body
to
it
the
alcohol
at
8
5
is
impressively
well
hidden
i
never
even
got
any
sort
of
burn
from
it
overall
this
beer
is
fantastically
well
done
the
only
detriment
i
found
was
the
dryness
which
i
thought
was
a
little
over
the
top
nonetheless
it
was
overall
an
exceptional
beer
wasnt
what
i
expected
after
seeing
the
alcohol
content
on
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
leffe
has
a
citrus
smell
and
is
a
refreshing
pale
yellow
to
amber
colour
taste
reminds
me
of
an
english
ale
as
theres
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
as
well
as
banana
notes
theres
also
a
smoky
deeper
notes
reminiscent
of
whiskey
effervescent
refreshing
mouth
feel
that
makes
for
a
surprisingly
easy
drink
goes
down
like
a
regular
beer
so
be
warned
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tried
more
complex
than
my
limited
palate
can
truly
appreciate
the
overall
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
complement
each
other
perfectly
every
sip
seems
to
reveal
something
new
o
very
nice
beer
the
flavors
are
really
good
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
i
dont
get
even
the
slightest
bit
of
alcohol
in
this
beer
its
unbelievably
well
done
might
be
one
of
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
very
large
white
foam
head
with
long
retention
on
a
clear
bright
golden
body
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
coriander
herbal
hops
lemon
custard
musty
malts
flavors
provide
an
excellent
belgian
experience
with
nice
yeast
presence
very
herbal
hop
flavors
tart
citrus
some
pine
resin
and
a
little
more
alcohol
presence
than
i
feel
us
typical
of
the
style
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
as
stated
above
the
belgian
character
is
excellent
with
this
one
being
very
complex
and
yet
still
nicely
drinkable
i
am
surprised
i
have
gone
this
long
without
having
tried
this
one
o
tried
and
true
classic
cant
get
much
better
good
yeast
ester
character
with
enough
malt
to
support
and
not
overwhelm
finish
is
dry
enough
to
keep
me
wanting
more
but
a
little
to
bitter
for
my
liking
alcohol
is
a
touch
hot
o
a
highly
drinkable
well
crafted
beer
superb
example
of
the
style
i
think
the
balanced
flavors
and
slight
residual
sweetness
lets
this
pair
exceptionally
well
with
food

a
classic

o
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
was
about
56
months
ago
and
i
wasnt
really
to
impressed
with
it
im
happy
i
went
back
and
tried
it
again
i
feel
as
though
my
palate
has
progressed
because
now
i
rather
enjoy
this
beer
personally
it
wasnt
astounding
for
me
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
probably
pick
it
up
on
occasion
yes
im
an
ass
overall
the
first
time
i
tried
i
like
the
taste
better
the
second
time
was
not
impressed
it
is
probably
not
my
style
of
beer
i
like
the
lage
or
wheat
beers
better
then
this
one
it
save
me
money
too
o
ive
had
a
lot
of
duvels
before
this
one
and
i
do
think
they
were
better
than
this
one
im
afraid
this
duvel
didnt
get
very
well
with
the
cellar
i
taste
tested
this
with
la
chouffe
and
i
would
say
i
prefer
that
one
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
but
quickly
becoming
smooth
and
foamy
closes
quite
dry
somewhat
astringent
with
little
residual
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
i
cant
say
how
many
decades
ive
been
tasting
this
brew
but
its
many
the
brew
has
changed
over
the
years
and
a
corked
bottle
can
be
quite
different
from
draft
or
small
bottles
or
the
huge
bottles
generally
respectable
and
gotta
love
the
new
marketing
effort
with
designer
glasses
the
substantial
head
and
odour
immediately
draw
you
in
and
the
first
taste
you
will
realize
how
much
you
have
missed
i
could
not
recommend
a
better
brew
than
this
impressive
ale
from
this
belgium
brewery
theres
not
much
for
me
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
duvel
is
a
great
beer
and
is
worth
checking
out
even
moreso
since
its
widely
available
best
enjoyed
with
contemplating
the
deeper
things
of
life
such
as
r
w
emersons
essay
the
american
scholar
my
personal
choice
absolutely
a
great
beer
dynamite
tasting
beer
i
am
not
good
with
words
so
i
would
just
recommend
you
buy
some
and
try
it
yourself
small
bottle
gives
it
a
neat
look
but
cuts
by
of
12
ounces
by
8
but
gets
away
with
it
in
my
book
by
its
great
taste
and
nice
alchol
content
if
more
affordable
i
would
drink
it
more
frequently
hope
you
enjoy
some
any
beer
lover
should
try
duvel
go
on
o
on
tap
the
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
find
that
in
the
bottle
the
first
impact
is
a
bit
too
heavy
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
time
to
breathe
before
partaking
when
possible
find
on
tap
the
effect
is
much
better
by
far
one
of
my
top
choices
among
the
belgian
beers
i
prefer
on
tap
a
bit
on
the
chilled
side
once
warmed
the
sweet
flavored
really
stand
out
to
the
point
where
its
almost
overpowering
a
bit
strong
for
my
taste
appearance
and
aroma
similar
to
what
a
lot
of
guys
on
here
have
already
said
but
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
taste
had
a
more
experienced
beer
drinking
buddy
over
and
he
said
it
might
have
been
exposed
to
too
much
light
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
in
the
future
but
as
of
now
im
not
crazy
about
it
overall
really
beautifully
crafted
beer
wonderful
flavor
combined
with
a
fantastically
drinkable
smoothness
makes
this
a
joy
to
drink
my
only
drawback
the
price
at
3
50
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
its
nothing
ill
be
buying
with
much
frequency
the
review
before
this
one
said
it
tasted
like
a
heineken
no
o
im
sorry
but
this
beer
is
so
unbelievably
overrated
that
it
is
ridiculous
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
like
a
glorified
euro
pale
lager
i
love
how
im
seeing
people
review
this
beer
noting
its
flavors
which
compare
quite
well
to
adjuncts
yet
they
are
rating
it
so
highly
simply
because
they
feel
obligated
and
they
are
completely
biased
i
deliberated
this
beer
with
two
friends
both
craft
drinkers
one
of
them
has
been
drinking
craft
only
for
over
twenty
years
and
they
both
completely
agree
that
this
beer
does
not
live
up
to
any
of
the
hype
one
of
them
actually
called
it
rancid
bud
light
yes
dangerously
light
and
drinkable
and
exceptionally
refined
this
is
a
very
well
made
strong
belgian
ale
and
a
worthy
canonical
example
this
is
about
as
perfect
a
belgian
golden
ale
as
youre
going
to
easily
get
tons
of
flavor
with
a
lot
of
complex
notes
crisp
and
refreshing
love
it
overall
a
true
classic
complex
but
very
drinkable
hard
to
beat
in
the
style
o
nice
belgian
pale
has
huge
lemon
and
spice
characteristics
i
had
never
tried
this
beer
before
and
although
its
not
my
usual
hopbomb
type
of
brew
i
decided
to
delve
in
with
a
4
pack
anyway
the
first
bottle
i
thought
was
just
ok
by
the
last
of
the
4
pack
i
begrudgingly
came
to
this
realization
this
is
one
of
th
finest
easy
drinking
alcohol
hiding
delicious
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
will
now
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
would
most
likely
choose
this
beer
over
the
many
ipas
i
drink
on
a
regular
basis
advice
drink
this
bad
boy
nice
and
cold
good
stuff
im
just
trying
to
make
this
enough
characters
to
submit
wow
its
a
lot
harder
to
get
to
250
characters
than
i
remember
in
school
if
only
there
was
a
way
to
make
notes
without
a
review
or
if
there
is
hopefully
ill
figure
it
out
soon
overall
ill
admit
the
belgian
pale
ales
are
not
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
damnnear
perfect
example
of
the
style
extremely
flavorful
quite
complex
yet
very
clean
similar
to
champagne
in
many
ways
although
id
take
duvel
over
most
any
champagne
in
a
heartbeat
o
overall
this
beer
is
on
the
dry
side
but
theres
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
round
it
out
the
belgian
yeast
combined
with
huge
carbonation
makes
this
an
amazing
beer
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
style
beer
duvel
is
the
definitive
golden
ale
nice
medium
bodied
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
not
filling
o
its
good
its
historical
its
my
first
one
of
its
kind
it
will
be
one
of
those
beers
i
have
to
go
back
to
after
trying
more
examples
of
the
style
i
wonder
if
the
temperature
was
held
correctly
during
conditioning
or
if
the
priming
sugar
was
off
because
i
did
not
expect
it
to
be
this
spritzy
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
i
got
a
bad
bottle
of
duvel
though
cheers
i
bought
a
4pack
and
most
definitely
will
purchase
a
corked
bottle
to
age
a
true
triumph
o
i
will
never
call
myself
a
huge
fan
of
belgianstyle
beers
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
add
in
the
fact
that
this
beer
looks
simply
perfect
in
its
own
glass
and
this
was
an
enjoyable
experience
obviously
one
of
the
best
beers
around
overall
are
you
kidding
me
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
you
need
to
go
get
it
right
now
spectacular
enough
said
the
excellent
refreshing
taste
indicates
that
this
is
indeed
a
superb
alternative
for
a
pilsner
with
more
style
of
course
its
a
refreshing
albeit
strong
beer
such
strength
doesnt
leave
too
much
space
for
the
hops
but
the
spices
are
still
there
yeast
residue
in
bottle
o
no
wonder
it
is
called
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
this
is
great
not
much
else
i
can
say
really
but
ohh
hell
yeah
o
this
is
a
perfect
beer
its
very
tasty
and
refreshing
its
a
really
good
belgian
golden
if
you
like
belgian
ales
you
have
to
try
this
one
amazing
these
are
not
my
favorite
flavors
especially
in
beer
but
i
understand
the
high
numbers
this
ale
receives
as
it
is
very
intricate
in
its
tones
this
is
a
style
i
dont
drink
very
often
as
i
havent
had
many
that
i
really
crave
but
this
one
jumped
to
the
top
of
this
list
one
i
will
revisit
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
doesnt
get
much
better
for
the
style
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
gotta
give
it
high
marks
highly
recommeded
cheers
o
really
good
but
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
probably
because
i
fell
in
love
with
chimays
white
earlier
this
week
and
being
a
novice
when
it
comes
to
belgian
ales
and
trappist
im
confusing
myself
on
tastes
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
have
a
feeling
im
going
to
like
it
more
and
more
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
turns
to
meringue
at
the
top
a
constant
flow
of
carbonation
bubbles
feed
a
head
that
persists
forever
and
making
pouring
12
oz
into
a
pint
glass
impossible
in
one
attempt
the
aroma
on
this
is
quite
unique
apple
cider
and
pears
along
with
a
bready
yeasty
aroma
are
quite
inviting
bits
of
pepper
and
spice
round
out
the
nose
quite
well
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
just
a
hint
of
sugary
sweet
with
a
heavy
does
of
apple
and
light
fruits
light
hints
of
pepper
and
other
yeast
derived
flavors
balance
this
quite
nicely
light
to
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
tart
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
unique
and
wonderful
beer
how
come
i
am
just
trying
this
now
overall
this
is
a
terrific
brew
met
all
of
my
expectations
and
shattered
them
disclaimer
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
goldenstyle
ales
in
general
so
this
taste
may
not
line
up
with
yours
but
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
ever
had
taste
is
simultaneously
refreshing
and
complex
straight
up
on
the
tongue
is
a
crisp
citrusy
lemon
note
incredibly
balanced
with
some
yeast
notes
plunge
a
little
deeper
and
theres
a
delicious
green
apple
note
that
is
more
than
welcomed
other
citrusy
notes
combine
perfectly
with
the
yeast
and
create
a
miasma
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
slick
wet
and
infinitely
refreshing
all
the
way
through
the
finish
this
reputation
is
welldeserved
truly
a
classic
and
highly
recommended
overall
4
0
a
solid
world
class
beer
and
i
am
also
excited
to
get
the
tulip
glass
that
came
with
the
4
pack
gift
set
o
very
smooth
and
drinkable
extremely
well
made
pours
a
gorgeous
golden
blonde
with
a
huge
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
rocky
cap
good
amount
of
fruity
aroma
very
lively
looking
beer
tastes
are
fruity
for
most
part
with
a
bitterness
toward
the
end
and
a
fairly
hoppy
finish
from
the
saaz
excellent
mouthfeel
very
lively
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
will
definately
try
again
very
high
quality
stuff
final
thoughts
im
not
blown
away
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
with
no
offflavors
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
cheers
salud
duvel
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
its
certainly
the
beer
you
want
to
start
off
with
when
introducing
someone
new
to
bspas
all
around
it
contains
the
flavors
you
expect
from
a
belgian
ale
but
handles
them
in
a
nearly
perfect
way
dont
pass
this
one
up
youll
be
sorry
you
did
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
very
drinkable
yet
complex
quite
an
impressive
belgian
crisp
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
this
will
always
be
a
classic
in
my
book
oi
have
not
always
been
a
huge
duvel
fan
but
my
last
few
experiences
have
won
me
over
i
could
drink
this
with
food
or
by
itself
the
flavors
are
fullbodied
and
completely
without
gimmickry
or
trickery
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
need
any
barrelaging
or
inyourface
hops
to
get
the
job
done
o
the
example
of
this
style
looks
smells
tastes
feels
great
on
top
of
that
there
is
no
sign
of
that
8
5
abv
what
so
ever
if
your
curious
about
this
style
this
is
a
must
o
no
way
does
this
beer
even
seem
like
8
5
abv
this
drinks
and
tastes
like
a
4
summer
beer
wow
menacingly
good
ive
now
been
tempted
by
the
devil
and
i
want
some
more
ive
had
a
lot
of
american
made
golden
strong
ales
and
this
one
easily
sets
the
standard
slightly
carbanated
and
tingles
as
i
sip
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
without
question
o
light
citrusy
and
a
belgian
delight
o
like
i
said
my
go
to
blonde
having
visited
belgium
5
times
i
just
cannot
seem
to
find
a
better
replacement
this
is
pretty
much
the
landmark
example
of
the
style
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
punch
of
flavor
nothing
overly
complex
simple
and
restrained
overall
oh
so
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
ive
been
drinking
it
for
years
and
still
get
that
yup
this
beer
is
still
that
good
feeling
whenever
i
have
it
the
warmer
the
better
too
as
with
most
belgians
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
worthy
of
a
try
fantasic
mix
over
everything
you
would
ever
want
in
a
beer
a
must
try
oa
classic
belgian
golden
ale
with
great
flavor
a
beer
you
can
always
enjoy
o
duvel
is
a
pure
belgian
classic
its
worth
seeking
out
many
times
over
its
an
incredibly
well
crafted
ale
from
one
of
the
most
technological
breweries
on
the
planet
read
up
on
the
methods
and
complexity
it
takes
to
brew
this
ale
and
youll
want
to
show
your
appreciation
with
buying
a
bottle
i
promise
you
wont
regret
busting
the
top
off
one
of
these
only
to
pour
into
some
sort
of
crazy
belgian
style
brew
glass
of
your
choice
shalom
j
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
only
the
second
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
tried
and
i
cant
imagine
anything
better
really
nice
stuff
highly
refreshing
drinks
insanely
well
for
the
abv
and
carries
a
nice
complexity
and
flavour
profile
highly
crisp
and
big
on
flavour
mostly
dry
malt
and
tart
fruit
recommend
it
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
its
just
so
so
drinkable
i
dont
even
want
to
put
it
down
it
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
its
a
mistake
to
drink
this
too
cold
too
i
love
this
bspa
its
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
not
super
impressed
usually
a
fan
of
belgians
this
is
a
bit
less
complex
than
i
wanted
strong
alcoholmetal
taste
without
much
hop
or
malt
character
it
poured
a
beautiful
gold
color
the
aromas
are
incredible
the
taste
is
even
better
even
though
they
recommend
the
duvel
glass
ive
found
that
a
chalice
works
better
at
least
for
me
the
taste
of
the
beer
matches
the
aroma
very
hoppy
and
a
big
spicy
yeast
flavor
a
very
well
balanced
beer
its
worth
the
hype
straw

pretty

here
often

served
in

signature
glasses
with
terrible
artwork
however
as
far
as
presentation
absolutely
crystal
clear
and
beautiful
head
that
would
make
anyone
cry
it
had
a
crisp
and
clean
initial
taste
and
is
truly
beautiful
which
is
why
it
still
rated
a
4
5
in
my
book
o
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
hands
down
an
amazing
mixture
of
complexity
and
sweetness
contrasted
against
super
carbonation
leaves
with
a
super
crisp
and
fulfilling
feel
if
theres
a
beer
you
should
try
it
would
be
this
one
its
extraordinary
its
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
o
great
beer
always
refreshing
and
delicious
a
favorite
overall
for
the
cost
i
have
had
many
ales
that
would
blow
the
doors
off
duvel
for
15

pack
im
expecting
much
more
pours

one
of
the
worlds
most
balanced
beers
eminently
delicious
near
perfect
ah
the
infamous
duvel
sad
to
say
i
think
this
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
its
hype
it
has
wonderful
pale
straw
color
and
an
amazing
belgian
yeast
aroma
however
in
the
taste
department
i
found
this
to
be
rather
lacking
for
me
its
was
almost
entirely
yeast
with
very
little
malt
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
more
complex
flavor
the
feel
was
very
smooth
and
8
5
alcohol
wasnt
noticeable
at
all
despite
my
general
dislike
of
belgian
yeast
this
is
a
good
beer
a
true
benchmark
for
the
style
and
the
bar
it
sets
is
extremely
high
incredibly
drinkable
with
enough
flavor
to
be
memorable
yes
duvel
lives
up
to
its
fine
reputation
a
top
shelf
belgian
strong
pale
ale
o
this
beer
is
just
awesome
and
extremely
drinkable
some
of
the
darker
belgians
were
a
little
less
my
style
but
still
enjoyable
overall
golden
pale
ale
that
is
trying
to
be
somewhat
complex
but
still
maintains
the
style
in
a
straight
forward
manner
overall
while
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
it
is
also
a
forgettable
one
a
bit
too
yeasty
and
onedimentional
that
really
doesnt
invite
you
to
consume
more
the
hop
and
alcohol
add
a
slightly
biting
finish
maybe
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
a
very
delicious
and
drier
but
quite
flavorful
belgian
renowned
for
a
reason
o
admittedly
duvel
was
good
but
it
did
not
sit
as
well
with
my
palate
than
clearly
it
has
with
the
majority
of
other
drinkers
it
was
fine
but
perhaps
a
good
number
of
the
complexities
were
lost
on
my
palate
leaving
me
disappointed
overall
o
it
beer
it
good
probably
my
oldest
love
and
the
first
beer
i
actually
remember
liking
i
dont
always
drink
fancy
barrelaged
stuff
and
when
i
dont
just
give
me
a
few
of
these
and
im
a
very
happy
camper
burp
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
enigma
of
a
beer
bold
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
front
end
yet
layered
in
complexity
with
plenty
of
alcohol
for
anyone
fantastic
beer
stands
at
the
front
of
the
line
in
its
class
o
an
iconic
belgian
pale
im
finding
i
like
other
a
bit
more
but
this
is
the
posterchild
for
the
style
o
first
tried
this
years
ago
as
part
of
a
sampler
basket
put
together
by
my
brother
it
was
a
revelation
then
and
still
is
outstanding
drink
this
with
sympathy
for
the
devil
by
the
rolling
stones
get
it
overall
amazing
belgian
beer
highly
recommended
overall
really
really
satisfying
this
is
what
beer
is
meant
to
taste
like
blows
most
out
of
the
water
tastes
like
how
i
imagine
beer
tasting
in
the
medieval
era
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
been
known
to
down
entire
750
ml
bottles
of
the
stuff
before
i
even
realize
its
gone
clean
enough
to
be
accessible
to
even
those
who
dont
necessarily
prefer
the
belgian
style
of
brewing
but
also
so
quintessentially
belgian
you
can
taste
the
flavors
from
the
unique
yeast
strain
that
make
duvel
its
own
beer
edit
after
letting
my
third
bottle
decant
before
serving
i
can
now
say
it
is
as
good
as
i
initially
expected
and
as
such
will
bump
up
scores
accordingly
it
features
this
amazing
citrusy
note
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
thats
damn
near
orgasmic
and
it
feels
even
lighter
and
more
refreshing
on
the
palate
ben
berman
this
isnt
my
style
of
beer
but
it
is
definitely
one
of
those
that
hits
you
and
its
the
only
beer
that
will
suffice
im
amazed
that
someone
can
turn
some
barley
and
flowers
into
a
beverage
like
this
o
a
wonderful
beer
the
classic
light
belgian
pale
with
lots
of
kick
really
fantastic
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
it
is
not
my
favorite
it
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
imports
everything
about
this
beer
is
just
exceptional
the
only
downside
is
the
price
which
is
above
average
even
for
imports
not
worth
the
price
overall
really
refreshing
and
balanced
the
esters
and
belgian
yeast
are
right
there
its
very
light
with
green
apple
and
grass
delicious
what
can
i
say
this
is
duvel
the
epitome
of
belgian
pale
beers
its
complex
its
thirst
quenching
its
spicy
and
exotic
i
could
drink
this
all
day
whether
its
summer
or
winter
its
a
great
beer
i
will
be
going
back
to
for
years
to
come
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
pours
a
straw
colored
pale
yellow
with
a
pillowy
two
and
a
half
finger
bright
white
head
adundant
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
the
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
ripe
fruit
opens
with
yeast
grassy
hops
and
a
pleasant
accent
of
alcohol
a
touch
of
juicy
ripe
fruit
midpalate
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
adundant
effervescent
carbonation
however
still
smooth
with
just
the
right
touch
of
creaminess
this
brew
is
the
standard
for
belgian
strong
pale
ales
a
triumph
i
had
rated
this
lower
previously
but
for
some
reason
maybe
because
i
just
drank
a
kwakthis
just
tastes
so
superior
from
the
color
to
the
lacing
to
the
taste
this
product
just
seems
so
satisfying
great
color
of
straw
yellow
nice
balanced
taste
great
taste
with
a
strong
abv
pure
happiness
definitely
an
easy
one
to
drink
through
the
night
exceptional
beer
astounding
complexity
and
a
big
drink
in
itself
most
people
would
say
something
like
i
dont
get
back
to
this
one
often
enough
i
would
agree
with
that
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
yellow
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
kept
expanding
for
minutes
after
the
pour
truly
a
gorgeous
beer
scents
of
barnyard
funk
sour
notes
lemon
zest
cirtus
and
very
slight
bit
of
banana
a
complex
nose
predicting
the
flavor
to
come
and
being
quite
appealing
on
its
own
taste
is
complex
with
flavors
of
pilnser
malt
citrus
fruitiness
graininess
moderate
hop
bitterness
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
the
finish
is
dry
as
is
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
flavor
in
the
after
taste
that
reminds
me
of
burnt
marshmallows
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
its
quite
complex
and
combines
in
an
excellent
way
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
good
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
hiding
the
abv
quite
well
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
has
a
complex
nose
and
flavor
it
looks
fantastic
it
has
a
wonderful
fluffy
head
and
an
excellent
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
it
now
far
more
than
i
did
a
year
ago
when
i
first
tried
it
duvel
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
and
well
worth
drinking
overall
this
is
a
well
made
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
that
ive
had
often
while
the
palate
makes
this
tough
for
me
to
drink
in
mass
quantities
the
flavor
is
enojoyable
enough
for
me
to
revisit
it
from
time
to
time
a
solid
brew
for
sure
o
true
to
the
style
and
wellbalanced
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
better
than
the
tremmens
i
had
which
is
the
only
other
beer
ive
had
from
this
style

a
very
nice
belgian
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
rite
of
passage
i
feel
like
i
needed
i
think
victory
and
some
other
american
brewers
have
emulated
it
just
as
well
though
for
a
beer
with
a
high
abv
this
is
very
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
the
price
is
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
giving
a
higher
overall
score
i
really
enjoyed
this
beers
taste
much
better
flavor
than
most
bspas
my
brain
has
been
trained
to
see
a
clear
golden
beer
and
not
expect
fullness
of
flavor
and
body
but
this
one
breaks
both
of
those
assumptions
oa
nice
beer
cant
say
i
get
why
people
are
in
love
with
it
though
o
man
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
malt
aroma
just
reminds
me
of
cheap
beer
and
i
just
couldnt
get
over
it
it
did
get
a
little
better
as
it
warmed
up
some
or
as
i
got
used
to
it
but
didnt
meet
my
expectations
but
ill
try
it
again
and
see
if
i
have
a
different
experience
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
although
a
bit
pricey
it
is
a
great
brew
for
just
about
any
occasion
overall
exceptional
this
was
my
first
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
was
skeptical
at
first
bc
i
have
high
regard
for
belgian
strong
darks
in
fact
this
one
outperforms
most
darks
in
both
complexity
and
taste
o
my
top
5
beers
of
all
time
flavorful
and
light
yet
highly
drinkable
and
inviting
classy
beer
to
drink
one
off
or

duvel
is
considered
a
classic
for
a
reason
it
has
a
wonderfully
balanced
sweetbitter
flavor
profile
that
is
boosted
by
the
excellent
mouthfeel
and
never
reveals
the
high
alcohol
content
here
is
a
belgian
beer
that
is
more
accessible
than
most
but
its
accessibility
does
not
make
it
any
less
of
a
class
act
excellent
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
mountainous
craggy
white
head
the
aroma
smells
mildly
of
apple
pear
and
trace
amounts
of
hops
the
massive
head
tempers
only
slightly
as
you
drink
maintaining
itself
like
a
champ
the
first
thing
i
notice
upon
tasting
is
the
intense
carbonation
whose
prickliness
near
singes
the
tongue
though
not
in
a
bad
way
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
juicy
up
front
similar
to
the
aroma
while
some
bitterness
presents
on
the
back
end
there
is
an
almost
honeylike
sweetness
that
melds
with
the
apple
and
pear
notes
a
strong
sense
of
apple
peel
becomes
increasingly
evident
as
it
warms
and
a
slight
spiciness
begins
to
manifest
in
the
finish
hops
are
tastefully
integrated
just
enough
to
lend
some
balance
and
complexity
as
the
session
continues
alcohol
becomes
more
present
in
the
aroma
though
not
so
much
on
the
palate
which
is
impressive
for
the
abv
swaths
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
recedes
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
indeed
and
not
short
on
flavor
hard
to
find
fault
here
in
any
regard
and
pretty
much
the
grandest
head
youll
find
in
a
beer
a
real
winner
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
some
haze
and
a
huge
frothy
white
head
big
inviting
smell
the
yeast
is
dominating
but
smells
great
some
peppery
clove
smells
come
through
with
some
subtle
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
no
one
unique
flavor
come
out
of
the
yeast
but
some
spice
and
malt
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
which
adds
to
the
beer
nice
blend
of
all
elements
this
is
the
best
aspect
every
flavor
seems
to
be
in
just
the
right
proportion
to
every
other
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
overpowering
cant
really
tell
its
a
higher
abv
definitely
worth
checking
out
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
for
8
5
abv
although
the
spice
could
be
better
overall
always
a
great
beer
to
have
hard
to
turn
on
down
tasty
strong
and
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
in
a
row
always
a
point
of
comparison
for
the
belgian
style
what
a
damn
fine
beer
o
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
flavorful
and
so
drinkable
despite
its
abv
thick
body
and
quite
carbonated
try
this
one
youll
not
be
sad
for
it
o
this
is
a
true
classic
and
in
my
opinion
it
truly
deserves
to
be
regarded
as
such
it
is
not
too
dry
not
too
heavy
and
quite
refreshing

note
to
self
similar
to
but
drier
than
piraat
and
so
the
hop
bitterness
more
pronounced
the
balance
you
like
so
much
in
piraat
is
skewed
towards
the
hops
which
you
dont
like
so
much
can
you
tell
im
just
trying
to
fill
more
space
here
just
need
five
more
words
there
o
great
beer
i
see
why
this
is
a
classic
that
has
been
around
so
long
one
of
the
torch
bearers
that
got
us
through
the
dark
ages
before
the
craft
brewing
boom
o
the
ratings
for
this
beer
do
not
lie
this
is
simply
a
worldclass
offering
that
everyone
needs
to
try
despite
its
long
shelf
life
i
would
recommend
acquiring
it
as
fresh
as
possible
according
to
the
website
it
has
a
36
month
shelf
life
furthermore
follow
the
instructions
on
pouring
a
duvel
and
that
will
guarantee
you
an
even
more
enjoyable
experience

a
small
bottle
o
very
decent
like
i
expected
while
it
is
good
there
isnt
really
much
i
would
say
that
is
memorable
about
this
beer
it
is
a
very
delicious
straight
forward
belgian
ale
because
of
the
price
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
other
than
that
this
is
an
overall
good
beer
very
classic
overall
a
true
classic
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
review
this
one
but
i
am
a
big
fan
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
hazy
yellow
with
an
abundant
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
retains
fairly
well
leaving
less
than
a
finger
of
head
atop
the
beer
and
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
theres
a
strong
aroma
of
fruity
yeast
spices
and
light
malts
the
flavor
is
very
bold
but
it
does
follow
the
smell
the
yeast
and
malt
flavors
come
together
very
well
with
the
spiciness
and
the
hops
there
is
some
apple
flavor
as
well
its
a
very
pleasing
flavor
and
the
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
balance
extremely
well
the
alcohol
is
covered
very
well
by
all
the
flavors
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
abundant
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
that
is
8
5
abv
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
every
one
exploring
beer
should
consume
at
least
once
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
strong
beer
very
crisp
taste
just
careful
dont
drink
too
many
the
taste
is
far
different
than
the
smell
you
first
get
some
of
the
yeast
perhaps
a
nice
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
and
a
nice
tart
sparkling
winelike
tartness
on
the
way
down
im
tasting
some
really
nice
bready
notes
coming
back
after
the
finish
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
a
little
strong
to
be
sessionable
but
definitely
a
beer
that
you
want
to
have
many
times
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
this
is
a
strong
beer
overall
yum
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
that
i
have
had
each
swallow
made
me
look
forward
to
the
next
i
definitely
what
some
more
of
this
pour
and
enjoy
this
elixir
of
the
gods
o
excellent
belgian
strong
ale
had
it
a
couple
of
times
and
it
never
disappoints
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
earth
one
of
the
first
beers
i
discovered
as
i
began
to
appreciate
beer
and
over
2
years
and
many
many
glasses
of
duvel
later
it
is
still
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ive
ever
had
sex
in
a
bottle
for
sure
o
this
is
a
great
belgian
beer
with
many
textures
of
flavor
i
love
its
crisp
bitterness
and
it
goes
down
easy
there
will
always
be
a
spot
in
my
fridge
for
this
beer
o
good
flavor
it
paired
well
with
pasta
and
cheese
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
chardonnay
champagne
a
little
bit
heavier
than
your
normal
champagne
but
thats
what
you
want
with
food
o
i
guess
this
is
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
and
about
as
good
as
it
gets
when
it
comes
to
belgian
pale
ales
a
very
fine
beer
indeed
bottom
line
world
class
beer
great
tasting
beer
but
became
hard
to
finish
if
i
had
it
again
i
would
choose
the
smaller
bottle
all
5s
should
be
rare
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
beer
deserves
all
5s
taste
is
absolutely
subjective
mine
tells
me
that
this
one
is
5s
all
the
way
around
i
buy
one
for
people
who
havent
had
tried
it
any
chance
that
i
get
i
love
it
to
no
end
havent
had
one
in
months
yet
think
about
it
almost
every
day
i
am
glad
to
have
been
introduced
to
this
beer
i
drink
a
lot
of
alcohol
but
this
is
magic
in
a
bottle
im
afraid
this
beer
may
have
been
hyped
up
a
bit
granted
im
a
little
biased
being
american
and
all
but
this
one
has
certainly
been
influenced
by
some
european
marketing
tactics
lets
face
it
most
american
pale
ales
would
blow
this
one
away
for
example
oskar
blues
dales
pale
ale
or
even
anything
from
sn
and
this
one
is
even
considered
a
strong
o
extremely
drinkable
and
subtly
complex
its
a
style
onto
itself
and
a
great
style
at
that
poured
from
330ml
bottle
to
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
perfect
gold
with
a
swelling
soft
white
head
that
fills
the
snifter
and
then
recedes
gradually
to
a
healthy
dollop
constant
needlepoint
beading
that
doesnt
let
up
the
beer
smells
just
wonderfully
bright
and
clean
fresh
all
kinds
of
inviting
esters
and
clove
some
light
pepper
and
fruit
crisp
sweet
grain
the
taste
is
equally
impressive
just
the
right
touch
of
spice
to
complement
everything
found
in
the
nose
the
belgian
yeast
really
comes
to
the
forefront
the
pinnacle
of
the
beer
i
think
its
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
nice
dry
slightly
spicy
finish
this
beer
is
overall
nearly
without
flaw
this
beer
is
excellent
its
interesting
flavorful
and
refreshing
overall
simply
a
world
class
brew
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
praise
but
it
is
certainly
deserving
of
such
accolades
this
is
for
sure
in
my
top
5
beers
almost
the
perfect
brew
imo
o
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
complexity
a
must
in
the
belgian
landscape
and
on
the
shelves
of
any
beer
enthusiast
appeared
a
bright
transparent
gold
with
about
3
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
smelled
of
light
citrus
apple
and
malt
with
a
sweet
undertone
taste
was
spoton
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
very
crisp
clean
flavors
with
hints
of
apple
pear
and
light
citrus
great
mouthfeel
as
it
left
you
with
a
refreshing
taste
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
this
one
sets
the
standard
for
this
style
plus
it
paired
very
well
with
all
of
the
meat
i
was
being
served
at
the
brazilian
steak
house
poured
into
the
signature
duvel
glass
apparently
i
did
not
get
the
perfect
pour
but
i
was
pretty
close
to
the
recommended
pour
anyhow
poured
the
trademark
big
head
which
was
soapy
and
fizzly
honey
colored
body
with
some
yeast
present
as
i
did
decide
to
pour
the
settlement
in
i
feel
as
the
beer
is
not
complete
without
it
smells
of
strong
character
malts
followed
by
a
wave
of
corn
banana
biscuit
and
sweet
cane
sugar
tastes
of
banana
yeast
a
biscuit
with
a
slight
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
like
drinking
a
soda
fizzling
sensation
throughout
the
whole
drink
but
somehow
it
works
out
very
well
balanced
belgian
ale
i
want
more
o
my
second
belgian
strong
pale
ale
very
nice
yeast

not
hop
forward
like

its
own
beast

overall

lives
up
to
its
reputation
d
overall
an
excellent
beer
its
easy
to
see
why
this
one
is
an
absolute
classic
and
a
musttry
for
any
beerlover
while
the
flavor
profile
is
fairly
big
and
complex
its
also
balanced
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
through
the
roof
a
great
belgian
and
a
fantastic
beer
overall
my
preference
to
this
is
hennepinwhich
is
outstanding
o
such
a
delicious
beer
its
most
devilish
quality
is
that
even
though
the
alcoholic
warmth
lets
you
know
youre
dealing
with
something
powerful
the
taste
makes
you
dive
headfirst
into
the
deal
anyway
a
classic
overall
unique
to
say
the
least
i
liked
it
definitely
refreshing
something
to
drink
on
a
wine
occasion
o
really
liking
the
light
belgian
taste
balanced
and
not
over
powering
a
i
updated
this
review
as
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
as
i
have
tried
and
experienced
other
beers
from
belgium
it
is
far
better
than
i
realized

level

the
prickly

is
surprising
for

overall
this
is
just
a
fantastic
belgian
strong
pale
great
balance
complexity
and
smooth
drinking
and
also
has
the
best
glass
in
the
beer
world
overall
its
a
classic
for
a
reason
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
that
sets
the
standards
for
the
others
o
this
is
the
type
of
beer
to
grab
when
you
need
something
crisp
refreshing
and
uplifting
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
though
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
is
present
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
help
disguise
the
8
5
abv
im
sure
ill
have
this
beer
again
but
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
on
a
scorching
hot
summer
day
edit
the
750ml
corked
version
is
fresher
and
more
alive
the
foam
is
chewier
and
the
lemons
and
apples
seem
to
have
been
replaced
with
pungent
fresh
cut
grass
and
earth
if
this
beer
was
hard
to
find
i
bet
it
would
be
more
sort
after
than
westy
xll
overall
tantalizing
overall
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
pales
so
far
so
damn
flavorful
and
complex
yet
so
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
you
must
try
it
duvel
is
my
goto
beer
whenever
i
can
find
it
in
a
store
a
reasonable
price
for
an
amazing
brew
as
i
cruise
up
and
down
the
aisles
im
always
telling
myself
i
can
always
get
duvel
im
a
sucker
for
belgian
strong
pale
ales
and
this
is
the
one
that
turned
me
onto
them
the
head
on
this
beer
is
thick
enough
to
support
a
dime
sometimes
i
get
a
bit
of
a
sour
scent
that
comes
off
of
it
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
damn
near
flawless
amazing
floral
mix
in
the
taste
that
incorporates
lots
of
hops
with
a
mix
of
fruit
such
as
citrusy
gold
pour
this
into
a
tulip
glass
if
you
have
one
but
even
a
pilsner
will
do
anything
that
will
lead
the
head
expand
and
release
all
of
its
magic
overall
4

duvel
is
a
beautiful
beer
it
never
gets
old
is
about
the
most
approachable
thing
out
there
but
is
still
so
well
done
that
anybody
can
appreciate
it
i
might
prefer
the
style
to
be
funky
with
more
fruity
esters
and
a
wheat
edge
in
there
but
duvel
really
is
a
benchmark
in
bspas
i
bought
this
beer
liking
the
way
it
looked
on
the
shelf
it
pours
into
a
glass
very
nicely
with
a
good
bit
of
head
the
aroma
is
a
fruity
taste
with
a
kind
of
bitter
finish
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
way
over
my
price
range
for
the
taste
even
tho
it
has
a
fancy
looking
bottle
doa
it
hides
the
8
5
avb
well
and
to
me
is
actually
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
on
a
summer
day
this
is
one
to
keep
stocked
this
is
one
of
those
memorable
beers
once
you
have
had
a
duvel
you
will
remember
it
i
typically
dont
dig
much
on
many
belgians
and
yeasty
beers
piss
me
off
this
happened
to
avoid
pissing
me
off
though
the
headache
that
often
results
from
these
beers
is
creeping
in
onot
an
everyday
ale
for
me
but
a
great
brew
picked
up
a
4pack
with
a
glass
gift
set
i
cleaned
the
glass
and
poured
from
one
of
the
bottles
the
freshness
date
was
indiscernible
to
due
lack
of
ink
and
rubbing
to
the
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
huge
3
finger
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
head
slowly
fades
beer
is
a
perfectly
clear
and
bright
straw
color
excellent
appearance
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
crisp
fruity
character
pear
mild
banana
apple
hints
of
spicy
hops
very
nice
the
flavor
is
even
more
impressive
with
such
complex
character
and
ultimate
balance
again
light
fruity
character
as
found
in
the
nose
with
pairs
perfectly
with
a
tart
bready
flavor
mild
bitterness
works
very
well
with
the
citrus
tart
full
bodied
and
crisp
and
clean
overall
a
supreme
beer
instantly
one
of
my
favorites
highly
recommended
o
overall
this
a
great
beer
id
recommend
to
any
fan
of
belgian
styles
and
new
craft
beer
drinkers
delicious
beer
must
try
its
beers
like
this
that
make
belgium
famous
for
beer
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
very
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
appearance
is
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
very
enjoyable
i
tried
this
in
a
class
about
fungi
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
there
was
a
large
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
edge
of
the
cup
as
i
drank
it
was
a
murky
golden
beer
which
had
smells
that
were
fruity
and
even
a
bit
spicy
it
was
dry
and
had
a
light
mouth
feel
as
well
an
awesome
beer
for
189
here
quite
worth
it
its
heavier
than
it
looks
yet
so
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
sharp
enough
that
youve
gotta
sip
it
though
solid
beer
as
its
sterling
reputation
suggests
o
this
beer
is
juicy
like
biting
into
a
malt
hop
stuffed
granny
smith
apple
flavor
abounds
the
legend
of
duvel
has
existed
before
me
and
will
continue
when
im
gone
cheers
o
certainly
one
of
the
best
and
easiest
to
procure
bspas
personally
i
like
the
ommegang
offerings
gnomegang
bpa
and
russian
rivers
damnation
just
a
little
better
this
is
a
solid
top
3ish
though
first
beer
review
first
things
first
i
see
all
the
love
settled
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
i
had
to
re
introduce
all
that
lava
lamp
goodness
back
to
this
one
good
color
resembles
a
cloudy
golden
color
thick
cloud
like
head
as
it
cleared
it
left
some
real
cool
lacing
took
some
time
to
settle
tons
of
champaine
bubbles
good
malty
fruit
aroma
slighty
yeasty
kick
with
some
tartness
at
first
sip
good
carbonation
smooth
slick
an
tasty
finish
a
great
belgian
gold
i
can
see
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
on
a
regualr
basis
not
overly
complex
or
intimidating
reviewed
on
my
mobile
too
great
beer
overall
great
beer
for
the
craft
beer
curious
overall
this
is
nice
and
refreshing
what
more
can
be
said
about
this
wonderful
beer
top
stuff
world
class
brew
indeed
duvel
has
marked
a
benchmark
of
its
genre
a
must
try
for
all
levels
drinker
overall
cmon
this
thing
is
a
classic
and
a
god
damn
treat
that
you
can
get
it
at
any
respectful
bottle
shop
this
is
the
quintessential
bspa
to
me
this
is
a
superb
brew
and
a
belgian
classic
every
beer
drinker
should
know
what
this
tastes
like
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
it
is
very
refreshing
but
be
aware
of
the
high
abv
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
high
quality
beverage
here
o
overall
quite
a
nice
one
though
with
the
slightly
high
abv
no
denying
it
this
is
world
class
but
do
compare
to
sloeber
o
not
every
bottle
is
consistent
in
my
experience
this
is
such
a
familiar
and
special
beer
but
occasionally
ill
open
a
bottle
that
seems
a
bit
off
the
hops
are
skunked
or
maybe
its
gone
stale
or
corked
this
falls
short
for
me
bspa
is
a
style
ive
been
liking
more
and
more
lately
but
this
gold
standard
falls
short
for
me
it
looks
amazing
though
overall
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
belgim
beers
verdict
i
definitely
would
enjoy
this
with
some
cheeses
or
cold
meat
it
doesnt
come
across
to
me
as
wellsculpted
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
relatively
inexpensive
with
some
bite
and
solid
abv

you
could
certainly
do
worse
notes
the
definitive
belgian
golden
strong
ale
o
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
definetely
worth
a
go
rjt
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
interestingly
fruity
with
a
little
bit
of
complexity
just
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
we
had
our
neighborhood
world
beer
tasting
soiree
last
night
and
we
tried
the
duvel
belgian
golden
ale
the
beer
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
that
laces
the
smell
includes
alcohol
cracker
light
grass
the
taste
carries
belgium
malt
and
lemon
grass
zing
power
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
big
bodied
with
massive
carbonation
the
alcohol
content
make
this
a
tough
beer
fantastic
carbonation
and
perfect
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
all
time
classic
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
be
without
although
a
bit
pricey
its
relatively
easy
to
find
which
is
a
big
plus
on
this
particular
occasion
i
had
a
glass
of
duvel
followed
by
damnation
by
russian
river
brewery
and
i
thought
duvel
was
better
although
damnation
was
pretty
damn
good
too
ive
been
meaning
to
buy
this
one
for
a
while
but
the
only
thing
that
discouraged
me
was
the
price
i
snagged
a
4
pack
on
sale
and
with
a
really
cool
duvel
oversized
tulip
for
12
99
i
am
going
to
thoroughly
enjoy
drinking
the
other
three
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
8
5
abv
very
well
definitely
will
be
pick
up
some
more
very
soon
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
world
class
its
a
classic
and
maybe
my
favorite
trappist
serving
type
bottle
overall
great
beer
well
balanced
a
fine
example
really
like
this
overall
i
still
love
this
beer
especially
when
on
sale
which
happened
to
be
the
case
this
time
hard
to
turn
down
such
a
solid
import
that
delivers
every
time
when
given
the
opportunity
to
introduce
a
more
complex
or
foreign
beer
to
friends
this
is
usually
my
brewery
of
choice
a
solid
belgian
blonde
for
sure
highly
recommend
this
one
head
retention
is
awesome
the
only
thing
is
misleading
is
the
smell
a
little
musty
just
a
great
balance
in
a
beer
you
can
drink
it
all
year
round
nice
to
warm
up
with
or
even
a
great
summer
beer
i
gotta
get
back
to
my
duvel
o
i
enjoy
this
a
lot
it
has
a
very
clean
inoffensive
flavor
that
will
appeal
to
even
the
biggest
beer
hater
picking
this
up
for
15
which
includes
4
330
ml
duvels
and
a
duvel
tulip
glass
makes
this
a
5
overall
hard
to
beat
that
bargain
this
appears
a
light
clear
goldenyellow
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
billowy
foam
estery
aroma
very
floral
with
some
clove
some
coriander
a
sprinkle
of
banana
i
realize
this
is
starting
to
sound
like
a
hefe
description
with
an
underlying
sweetness
to
it
tastes
full
of
yeasty
estery
flavor
springtime
fruits
and
flowers
in
bloom
a
light
clove
dusting
some
crushed
coriander
lightly
bodied
and
effervescent
the
8
5
is
apparent
especially
on
the
finish
id
love
to
see
how
this
develops
over
a
few
years
o
i
always
order
this
beer
if
i
see
it
on
the
menu
it
never
disappoints
i
also
would
like
to
try
to
brew
a
clone
of
it
one
day
owonderfully
refreshing
beer
famous
for
a
reason
this
classic
golden
belgian
brew
is
exceptional
pours
clear
golden
with
a
massive
white
foam
head
delicate
and
beautiful
awesome
aromatics
happening
here
smells
of
yeast
and
spice
with
slight
citrus
notes
flavor
is
big
and
bold
for
a
yellow
beer
and
to
me
the
quintessential
belgian
golden
ale
mouthfeel
is
great
very
carbonated
and
almost
sharp
for
that
reason
but
rounded
off
my
a
lighter
body
and
a
complex
finish
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
fantastic
o
class
duvel
is
really
really
good
and
highly
drinkable
i
havent
had
many
examples
of
this
style
but
this
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
glad
i
have
three
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
overall
no
doubt
the
benchmark
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
stuff
is
fantastic
o
overall
a
great
beer
lots
of
things
going
on
in
this
my
duvel
tulip
will
have
many
more
reunions
with
this
beer
o
a
world
class
beer
no
doubt
served
33cl
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
still
love
the
glass
for
as
many
times
a
i
have
this
that
i
never
did
a
review
straw
yellow
capped
by
a
large
foamy
white
head
bubbling
carbonation
alcohol
cracker
light
grass
an
booze
waft
in
the
nose
sweet
bodied
with
crockery
goodness
alcohol
says
hello
light
bodied
yum
surprising
is
a
good
choice
for
gateway
beers
for
the
gmc
crowd
as
my
research
has
proven
overall
for
me
this
beer
defines
the
style
everything
about
this
beer
just
works
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
love
it
overall
been
wanting
to
try
one
of
these
for
a
while
now
what
a
perfect
time
for
thanksgiving
now
i
see
why
duvel
is
the
benchmark
for
belgian
strong
pale
ales
simply
excellent
who
needs
champagne
when
youve
got
this
the
benchmark
of
the
style
for
all
belgian
golden
strong
this
beer
doesnt
miss
a
beat
its
exemplary
in
all
categories
and
just
generally
kicks
ass
always
a
treat
and
one
i
dont
enjoy
often
enough
o
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
but
its
hard
to
justify
17
for
a
4pack
for
anything
other
than
special
occasions
that
being
said
i
know
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
because
it
is
just
plain
great
and
if
high
life
hadnt
bastardized
the
concept
i
would
declare
its
the
beer
equivalent
to
champagne
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
belgian
expecting
a
quad
overall
pretty
good
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
more
i
drank
although
the
thing
i
found
odd
was
the
more
i
let
it
sit
the
better
it
tasted
not
sure
if
theyre
all
like
this
or
just
the
batch
i
got
either
way
worth
trying
if
you
havent
id
buy
again
when
the
mood
strikes
has
a
crisp
apple
smell
almost
like
a
cider
nicely
carbonated
and
pours
a
big
frothy
head
golden
yellow
colour
with
lots
of
bubbles
it
tastes
a
bit
like
champagne
tangy
actually
a
lot
like
white
wine
without
so
much
of
the
sweetness
the
8
5
abv
has
no
where
to
hide
its
right
up
front
i
would
use
this
beer
as
a
wine
substitute
in
seafood
recipes
has
some
spicy
yeast
to
the
taste
there
is
more
going
on
that
i
cant
really
pick
out
but
i
just
know
i
like
it
so
smooth
and
crisp
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
o
still
on
of
my
favorites
but
maybe
not
at
the
very
top
my
palate
has
grown
but
this
beer
is
light
and
a
goto
for
me
could
drink
it
anytime
and
would
love
to
share
it
with
anyone
at
4
a
bottle
it
is
a
deal
as
well
overall
i
really
like
this
ive
never
actually
had
it
before
this
tasting
but
i
know
its
the
gold
standard
for
belgian
strong
pales
not
cheap
and
i
cant
say
i
will
be
getting
this
regularly
i
am
intrigued
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
do
for
this
brew
recommended
to
any
ba
looking
to
dip
their
toes
in
the
belgian
style
of
brewing
cheers
o
i
bought
a
few
of
these
mainly
because
i
wanted
the
glass
that
came
with
it
and
to
cross
duvel
off
my
list
glad
i
tried
it
and
its
good
under
the
right
conditions
but
its
just
a
try
once
beer
for
me
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
dries
out
nicely
with
some
age
o
i
was
expecting
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
duvel
delivered
just
short
of
outstanding
highly
recommended
even
at
4330ml
poured
into
huge
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
4
inches
of
fluffy
white
head
that
lingers
the
entire
beer
lacing
every
where
smell
is
clove
banana
q
breadyness
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
taste
is
all
that
more
powerful
then
the
smell
clove
dominates
but
in
a
pleasant
way
body
is
nice
not
thin
or
thick
easy
drinking
for
abv
i
think
it
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
but
this
is
very
pleasant
i
am
coming
around
to
the
style
still
a
work
in
progress
rather
sharp
and
austere
like
a
belgian
pilsener
on
tap
at
cueva
on
adams
avenue
in
san
diego
wow
at
el
corte
ingles
for
1
70
euros
given
that
they
hawk
spanish
lager
for
50
a
can
why
would
you
ever
choose
differently
330ml
into
a
duvel
tulip
its
hard
to
call
this
anything
other
than
the
perfect
beer
you
dont
even
realize
it
has
alcohol
in
it
the
head
is
massive
on
top
of
a
clean
golden
body
i
take
care
to
pour
it
to
the
point
where
duvel
recommends
so
that
there
is
an
even
divide
between
head
and
body
at
the
duvel
logo
lacing
is
excellent
deep
clean
funk
in
the
nose
balanced
like
a
tightrope
walker
tastes
soo
clean
its
not
the
beer
with
the
most
depth
ever
but
i
have
to
give
it
a
5
for
sheer
excellence
mouthfeel
is
unreal
so
much
energy
perfect
it
only
gets
a
4
5
overall
because
its
quite
expensive
in
these
partsa
4
pack
for
16
however
if
you
havent
had
duvel
you
should
immediately
try
it
regardless
of
the
quantity
this
beer
is
produced
in
you
can
see
that
the
brewers
keep
quality
at
the
top
of
their
priorities
this
is
just
amazing
if
your
barely
starting
your
journey
into
the
great
beers
of
belgium
this
is
a
great
start
final
grade
4
57
an
a
simply
constructed
yet
so
complex
in
execution
drinkable
with
a
capital
d
the
gold
standard
of
belgian
strong
pales
overall
excellent
loved
this
belgian
will
definitely
return
for
more
o
classic
a
bit
two
dimensional
but
one
of
the
best
in
this
category
this
beer
tastes
great
i
could
describe
it
but
you
should
have
already
had
a
bottle
this
beer
is
affordable
and
high
quality
you
can
get
it
almost
anywhere
so
whats
your
excuse
for
not
having
tried
it
o
a
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
any
place
at
any
time
overall
a
really
really
good
beer
im
definitely
going
to
explore
some
more
beers
from
this
style
and
will
pick
this
one
up
again
for
sure
o
another
belgian
worthy
of
its
reputation
o
i
like
it
but
i
can
think
of
others
in
the
style
i
like
more
this
one
is
a
devil
though
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
even
when
you
know
you
should
be
looking
out
for
it
overall
excellent
a
great
job
at
putting
complexity
into
something
that
looks
like
a
bmc
product
a
classic
aroma
is
the
quintessential
belgian
yeast
with
malted
grains
and
spices
flavour
is
well
balanced
from
start
to
finish
for
me
the
belgian
yeast
dominates
but
theres
a
lot
going
on
between
the
initial
malt
bready
sweetness
to
the
pleasantly
dry
crisp
finish
alcohol
warmth
is
present
but
8
5
abv
is
surprisingly
subtle
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
with
best
by
dating
into
a
pint
glass
i
thought
i
was
being
careful
but
the
pour
must
have
been
too
fast
as
it
foamed
into
a
head
at
least
half
the
glass
the
head
was
very
light
and
fluffy
as
was
the
lacing
the
color
was
very
pale
blonde
the
nose
lent
notes
of
malt
and
bready
goodness
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
clove
the
taste
was
complex
with
clove
grass
pepper
and
resin
there
was
a
trace
of
alcohol
but
nothing
way
out
front
that
grabs
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
with
greater
than
average
carbonation
a
brew
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
well
worth
the
time
to
find
it
and
price
to
buy
it
this
seems
to
be
the
epitome
of
the
style
but
all
in
all
nothing
spectacular
for
me
personal
taste
easily
downed
the
25oz
bottle
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
picked
up
at
total
wine
more
for
8
99
might
do
again
someday
o
there
are
a
handful
of
beers
that
i
consider
true
benchmarks
of
their
style
and
duvel
is
one
of
them
it
manages
to
toe
the
fine
line
between
pleasing
discerning
beer
geeks
and
being
so
easily
approachable
for
those
without
a
big
beer
background
this
beer
is
beautiful
through
and
through
bright
golden
with
a
rich
head
an
impressive
example
of
head
retention
natural
spritzy
carbonation
forms
at
the
nucleation
point
in
the
base
of
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
subtle
earth
tones
light
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spice
a
medium
but
surprisingly
quaffable
mouthfeel
for
the
abv
is
both
inviting
and
alluring
a
dry
finish
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
slightly
hazy

as

without

one
of
my
favourites
easy
drinking
and
full
of
flavour
complex
without
going
over
the
top
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
overall
i
get
this
one
only
a
couple
of
times
a
year
otherwise
id
feel
like
im
spoiling
myself
tried
with
wisconsin
blue
cheese
pair
is
excellent
o
an
outstanding
beer
if
it
werent
so
expensive
this
would
be
all
that
i
drink
very
nice
look
flavor
and
refreshing
qualities
give
this
one
an
a
notes
a
special
beer
uniquely
belgian
beautiful
to
look
at
complex
medicinal
simultaneously
dry
and
sweet
amazing
o
this
is
a
classic
drink
limitless
in
its
pairings
btw
i
honestly
consider
this
beer
to
be
the
a
top
5
belgian
strong
pale
ale
duvel
is
my
standard
by
which
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
are
measured
any
ba
is
best
served
by
having
a
duvel
at
some
point
a
model
progenitor
of
the
style
and
a
delicious
beer
at
that
ill
never
grow
tired
of
duvel
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
just
drink
and
also
a
pleasure
to
analyze
its
perfectly
balanced
and
unique
worth
the
buy
if
you
see
it
especially
as
its
almost
always
available
unless
im
mistaken
great
beer
overall
4
a
fantastic
looking
beer
lacing
on
the
tulip
looks
topnotch
the
whole
way
through
the
clean
dry
crisp
taste
coupled
with
the
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
the
warming
of
the
alcohol
combines
for
a
beautifully
crated
belgian
pale
the
bottle
fermentation
is
reflected
in
the
smell
which
carries
into
the
taste
undertones
well
rounded
overall
i
have
had
this
exceptional
beer
plenty
of
times
beer
and
will
defintiely
have
more
in
the
future
you
cant
go
wrong
with
drinking
one
of
these
truly
a
nice
world
class
beer
m
thin
body
dry
with
prominent
carbonation
very
clean
finish
with
almost
no
residual
stickiness
leaves
a
subtle
warmth
in
the
chest
as
well
d
a
very
good
belgian
beer
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
higher
abv
m
refreshing
crisp
slightly
tart
lots
of
fine
bubbles
not
my
first
duvel
but
my
first
review
this
is
a
magnificent
beer
a
fine
way
to
pass
some
time
at
amsterdam
schiphol
d
a
very
good
belgian
beer
made
on
an
impressively
large
scale
while
there
are
other
takes
on
the
style
that
i
prefer
i
would
happily
have
this
without
complaint
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
higher
abv
guess
the
name
is
appropriate
o
i
dont
see
why
this
gets
rave
reviews
ive
had
much
more
flavorful
strong
pales
and
pilsners
oh
well
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
either
the
mouthfeel
was
great
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
pretty
good
not
exceptional
a
function
of
massproduction
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
little
to
much
maybe
a
bitter
character
some
buttery
yeast
flavor
the
85
abv
is
hidden
very
well
but
still
warms
your
belly
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
truly
takes
a
full
bottle
to
meet
as
new
flavors
and
aromas
emerge
throughout
the
drink
the
lively
carbonation
and
balanced
flavor
profile
make
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
8
5
abvperhaps
dangerously
so
an
excellent
beer
for
those
times
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
but
also
full
in
flavor
this
seems
like
a
great
beer
for
pairing
with
a
meal
overall
very
unique
belgian
beer
cant
really
say
ive
had
something
quite
like
this
before
the
duvel
brewery
did
a
good
job
brewing
a
beer
which
has
so
many
different
flavors
which
compliments
each
other
somewhat
like
a
flavor
bouncing
effect
m
fairly
carbonated
great
yeast
strain
the
sour
and
acidic
qualities
really
make
this
beer
stand
out
its
complex
but
focused
im
not
100
but
i
think
this
tasted
different
when
i
had
it
in
ireland
not
sure
if
shipment
has
to
do
with
a
slight
difference
it
shouldnt
with
8
5
abv
i
didnt
taste
the
banana
with
this
glass
maybe
my
palate
has
grown
still
really
good
but
not
up
to
the
standards
my
palate
had
previously
regarded
it
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
deceivingly
drinkable
the
body
is
light
crisp
refreshing
and
easily
swallowed
the
carbonation
is
extremely
fizzy
but
does
not
seem
to
adversely
effect
the
taste
at
all
d
this
is
another
belgian
mainstay
id
never
had
before
its
also
an
excellent
beer
but
its
a
bit
more
pilsnery
than
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
at
least
in
terms
of
its
apparent
body
and
hoppiness
definitely
a
unique
and
memorable
brew
this
is
stunningly
drinkable
balanced
and
refined
for
such
a
hefty
offering
o
if
i
was
stocking
up
at
a
specialist
beer
store
this
is
not
something
that
i
would
choose
ive
had
quite
a
few
beers
that
ive
enoyed
far
more
that
said
it
is
definitely
above
average
and
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
fact
that
i
can
buy
it
at
my
local
supermarket
which
is
not
the
fact
with
rochefort
10
for
example
means
that
i
will
undoubtedly
be
purchasing
it
on
a
semiregular
basis
o
a
classic
a
great
intro
to
belgian
beers
and
a
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
o
not
a
massive
fan
of
this
classic
but
i
will
say
that
its
got
the
typical
belgian
yeast
grunt
with
a
touch
of
booziness
good
not
great
o
absolutely
wonderful
this
beer
became
even
better
after
it
warmed
up
a
touch
i
dont
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
duvel
but
i
am
really
glad
i
did
so
complex
yet
extremely
drinkable
great
tingle
in
the
mouth
with
a
wonderful
taste
truly
a
great
beer
medium
bodied
bubbles
bite
the
tongue
enough
to
tell
you
they
are
there
easy
sipper
a
tad
drying
only
a
little
bitter
d
this
might
be
my
favorite
beer
ever
provides
an
all
around
great
drinking
experience
the
drinkability
is
high
and
the
taste
is
stunning
no
disguise
of
the
8
5
strength
many
flavours
well
integrated
and
difficult
to
pick
out
refreshing
o
a
real
standard
very
easy
to
drink
pour
myself
one
4
out
of
5
nights
while
doing
my
closing
work
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
one
cheers
o
excellent
beer
that
i
regret
neglecting
for
so
long
please
forgive
me
beer
gods
if
you
were
like
me
and
saw
this
beer
on
the
shelves
numerous
times
and
instead
decided
on
something
else
than
next
time
i
beg
you
to
give
this
beer
a
shot
i
would
doubt
you
would
be
disappointed
cheers
overall
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
well
since
then
i
drink
duvel
every
couple
of
weeks
i
would
drink
it
more
often
but
its
super
expensive
and
really
strong
beside
that
the
gripe
i
have
is
the
beer
is
super
bubbly
bubbly
to
the
point
where
sometimes
i
have
to
sit
up
to
burp
myself
haha
if
you
see
it
available
you
have
to
try
it
odidnt
really
care
for
this
one
very
light
dry
and
smooth
but
lacks
and
any
wow
factor
tasted
like
bubbles
and
a
light
champagne
its
not
a
horrible
beer
i
just
didnt
have
the
buds
for
this
one
i
guess
o
all
the
pop
of
champagne
but
with
so
much
more
going
on
than
sour
grapes
lol
theres
a
reason
this
is
one
of
the
top
beers
of
its
style
it
deserves
it
i
found
this
bottle
for
2
on
the
singles
rack
but
at
154pack
its
still
totally
worth
the
price
food
match
the
finest
of
foods
caviar
lobster
and
truffles
poached
in
a
light
saffron
roux
with
parma
prosciutto
wrapped
asparagus
overall
looks
great
and
delivers
this
is
definitely
one
to
remember
and
have
again
later
one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
o
a
solid
choice
simple
yet
at
the
same
time
very
complex
overall
this
beer
rocks
it
was
one
of
the
beers
that
introduced
me
to
the
wonderful
things
being
done
with
beer
in
belgium
and
going
back
to
it
it
is
still
a
well
crafted
and
delicious
beer
for
any
time
of
year
o
very
drinkable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
i
actually
prefer
piraat
9
o
this
beer
exemplifies
what
a
worldclass
bsa
should
taste
like
the
consistency
flavor
and
aroma
merge
together
almost
flawlessly
o
pretty
good
but
not
great
definitely
not
a
session
beer
at
8
5
certainly
not
deserving
of
its
reputation
drinkability
excellent
truly
excellent
lots
of
flavour
and
feel
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
everything
goes
down
so
smoothly
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
next
bottle
i
have
in
my
fridge
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
overall
a
classic
great
belgian
beer
the
prime
example
of
the
strong
pale
style
ill
definatly
be
drinking
this
again
sometime
but
still
theres
many
belgians
i
would
pick
up
before
this
one
taste
was
reminiscent
of
the
aroma
completing
the
flavor
profile
spices
were
well
balanced
with
tart
apples
finished
by
a
beautiful
hop
bitterness
i
was
taken
back
by
how
strong
in
flavor
this
beer
is
with
its
high
drinkability
light
body
great
carbonation
and
and
a
lasting
mouthfeel
purely
fantastic
there
are
so
many
good
things
about
this
beer
claiming
that
it
is
a
benchmark
for
the
style
may
be
an
understatement
it
deserves
all
of
its
accolades
although
you
may
not
agree
if
you
dont
like
belgian
yeast
o
hard
to
get
better
than
this
every
part
of
this
is
top
notch
tasty
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overallspices
and
citrus
zest
cover
the
alcohol
almost
completely
which
is
impressive
given
the
relative
strength
this
beer
is
highly
satisfying
and
approachable
and
would
make
an
excellent
gateway
into
the
wonderful
world
of
belgian
beer
my
only
criticism
would
be
that
considering
that
this
is
a
golden
ale
the
finish
could
be
a
bit
dryer
but
overall
this
beer
is
very
very
hard
to
pass
up
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavours
and
aromas
its
an
overall
great
tasting
ale
a
great
present
from
my
dad
this
is
a
brew
i
havent
had
in
easily
three
years
i
used
to
remember
it
for
its
potency
but
having
worked
my
palate
a
bit
more
i
feel
like
i
can
now
really
appreciate
its
smoothness
and
fantastic
composition
certainly
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
a
classic
that
continues
to
live
up
to
its
name
o
rather
tasty
and
refreshing
not
amazing
but
enjoyable
overall
i
havent
had
a
duvel
in
a
long
time
but
genuinely
appreciate
it
in
the
genre
of
a
golden
really
enjoy
the
spice
to
this
beer
duvel
lives
up
to
its
image
and
is
worth
exploring
for
any
skeptics
wondering
about
the
hype
d
so
easy
to
have
more
than
one
after
another
after
another
due
to
how
crisp
this
beer
is
sneaky
and
lives
up
to
the
name
very
enjoyable
and
one
that
i
would
recommend
for
those
looking
to
find
a
way
to
get
into
belgian
beers
duvel
is
a
unique
beer
all
to
itself
i
thi
the
closest
thing
ive
had
before
is
an
orval
but
those
are
still
worlds
apart
funky
hoppy
complex
fruity
a
beer
to
aspire
to
overall
this
is
just
a
delicious
and
thirst
quenching
ale
the
8
5
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
a
very
refined
and
balanced
ale
that
reminds
me
of
a
fine
champagne
it
seems
at
its
best
at
about
45
to
50
degrees
this
is
not
a
big
belgium
ale
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
intense
experience
you
should
look
elsewhere
i
have
overheard
some
negative
comments
about
this
ale
but
i
feel
that
it
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
not
every
belgium
can
or
should
be
a
triple
if
you
have
not
tried
this
please
do
so
with
an
open
mind
and
you
will
be
rewarded
with
a
very
pleasant
experience
i
have
enjoyed
this
ale
many
times
over
the
years
and
if
fresh
it
is
very
consistent
this
beer
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
little
haze
since
i
got
the
last
pour
and
some
yeast
the
smell
was
slightly
hoppy
and
a
little
spicey
the
flavor
was
slightly
hoppy
not
flavor
wise
just
a
little
bitterness
and
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
and
an
almost
heiniken
like
skunkiness
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
over
all
i
was
unimpressed
by
this
beer
a
great
gift
this
is
a
beer
i
always
keep
around
overall
this
is
a
legendary
beer
recipe
that
has
been
romanticized
and
written
about
to
death
with
good
reason
how
anyone
could
casually
drink
it
on
a
weekly
basis
is
beyond
me
yet
its
tempting
flavorful
experience
is
a
well
justified
excuse
thanks
to
brouwerij
duvel
moortgat
you
can
drink
with
the
devil
without
running
the
risk
of
him
stealing
your
soul
in
the
process
even
though
drinking
this
beer
at
times
seems
to
emulate
such
an
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
good
amounts
of
carbonation
theres
a
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
even
with
the
bite
from
the
carbonation
there
is
still
a
nice
smoothness
in
each
sip
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
each
sip
makes
you
want
to
go
back
for
more
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
annoyed
with
myself
that
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
everything
just
fits
together
so
perfectly
and
the
flavors
are
so
appealing
that
you
cant
step
away
this
is
one
of
those
worldclass
beers
that
i
just
dont
get
its
not
awful
there
are
just
several
others
in
this
style
that
i
find
much
more
palatable
aggressive
pour
yields
a
massive
white
head
with
beautiful
lace
opaque
luminous
gold
color
smell
is
slightly
vinous
malty
yeasty
taste
is
sour
white
grape
booze
a
little
hop
bitterness
refreshing
medium
mouthfeel
a
little
bubbly
sticky
bitter
finish
o
kind
of
disappointed
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizenbock
minus
the
banana
fruitiness
to
balance
it
out
this
style
just
might
not
be
for
me
as
i
dont
think
2300
bas
could
be
wrong
ill
give
more
in
this
style
a
shot
and
maybe
come
back
to
this
one
and
rereview
d
a
classic
purchased
often
the
taste
was
strong
clean
and
intense
but
well
balanced
and
smooth
i
tasted
initially
a
strong
but
sweet
yeasty
tartness
that
ends
harmonious
pleasing
smooth
but
slightly
crisp
this
beer
is
a
class
act
it
pours
and
tastes
like
a
well
heeled
belgian
blonde
a
strong
robust
pleasing
experience
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
and
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
d
good
drink
its
a
duvel
they
make
plenty
of
great
stuff
and
im
never
let
down
by
this
drink
i
still
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
review
this
though
i
never
get
over
that
about
as
good
a
beer
as
youll
find
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
on
any
occasion
light
enough
for
a
warm
summer
night
spicy
and
complex
enough
for
a
holiday
meal
probably
the
best
beer
of
its
style
its
hard
to
imagine
someone
not
liking
this
poured
into
a
snifter
thick
soapy
iceburg
head
light
straw
colored
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
ample
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
sugar
belgian
yeast
some
alcohol
and
solvent
and
a
touch
of
apple
the
taste
is
of
belgian
yeast
alcohol
and
hops
much
more
than
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
beer
but
too
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
will
lower
the
overall
score
here
is
proof
that
a
light
colored
fizzy
beer
can
have
tons
of
flavor
this
is
one
to
seek
out
such
a
great
beer
very
complex
and
hits
all
the
right
notes
duvel
is
one
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
and
i
always
take
way
too
long
to
revisit
i
poured
this
into
a
duvel
wide
glass
best
before
0214
date
ill
save
a
couple
of
these
i
poured
a
little
too
much
and
have
a
few
lines
of
cloudy
yeast
near
the
top
i
dont
mind
the
yeast
though
the
color
is
pale
yellow
almost
straw
and
it
has
a
large
foamy
white
head
following
the
pouring
instructions
and
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
nice
belgium
yeast
pepper
spice
and
sweet
malts
very
strong
medium
mouth
feel
very
carbonated
which
tingles
on
my
tongue
and
a
little
bit
of
peppery
bitterness
is
present
the
taste
is
very
good
and
very
complex
the
peppery
taste
is
there
some
spices
a
little
tartness
and
finishes
bitterdry
very
good
this
is
way
better
than
i
remembered
the
last
and
only
time
i
had
it
a
few
years
ago
but
i
was
just
starting
on
belgiums
then
excellent
beer
im
glad
i
made
this
purchase
obviously
its
good
its
a
well
balanced
belgian
style
beer
with
a
satisfying
flavor
but
its
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
its
everyone
elses
fault
really
since
everybody
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
and
set
my
expectations
way
too
high
i
still
like
it
a
lot
but
it
fell
below
my
expectations
just
a
tiny
tiny
bit
overall
im
absolutely
in
awe
you
must
try
this
incredible
ale
i
am
now
questioning
all
of
my
previous
high
ratings
by
comparison
this
would
get
6s
or
7s
ive
never
seen
lacing
like
this
the
color
is
very
close
to
a
witbier
and
is
the
weekest
attribute
of
this
beer
the
flavor
and
complex
harmony
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tasted
before
and
the
mouthfeel
is
so
wonderful
smooth
drinkable
and
inviting
this
beer
is
downright
dangerous
in
a
fantrastic
way
i
could
drink
this
every
night
i
will
buy
this
quite
often
from
now
on
it
is
fairly
expensive
but
absolutely
worth
every
penny
i
love
this
beer
pure
pefection
period
definitely
a
very
enjoyable
beer
every
aspect
of
it
was
subtle
and
complex
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
felt
muted
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
its
taken
me
too
long
to
try
this
beer
and
find
that
its
wonderfully
complex
yet
light
and
refreshing
its
the
style
standard
for
a
reason
honestly
this
brew
for
me
started
out
much
nicer
then
it
finished
and
that
is
why
i
could
not
be
that
kind
in
my
rating
of
this
one
o
overall
quite
a
nice
one
though
with
the
slightly
high
abv
definitely
more
suited
to
enjoying
by
itself
rather
than
as
a
session
beer
overall
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
considered
the
paragon
of
its
style
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
seen
it
has
a
very
complex
nose
and
taste
with
a
good
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
and
deserving
of
the
hype
it
gets
o
great
drinkability
superb
taste
and
mouthfeel
my
local
supermarket
has
these
on
sale
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
rest
assured
od
i
was
missing
out
passing
this
by
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
a
great
beer
that
typically
very
easy
to
find
and
equally
easy
to
drink
i
bought
the
4pk
gift
box
because
it
had
the
glass
that
everyone
seems
to
rave
about
i
was
very
happy
with
the
purchase
the
beer
was
delicious
picked
up
a
gift
set
with
4
330
ml
bottles
and
a
beautiful
duvel
snifter
for
only
13
99
at
my
local
friar
tucks
i
poured
22
ounces
of
water
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
but
it
was
a
perfect
fit
for
the
11
2
ounces
of
golden
sunshine
and
the
pillowy
white
clouds
of
foam
the
lacing
was
artful
and
distinct
the
smell
was
bready
and
spicy
i
was
expecting
a
bitter
taste
resembling
a
lager
but
was
surprised
by
a
crisp
complex
taste
i
was
pretty
much
all
about
thick
russian
imperial
stouts
a
few
cold
months
ago
but
im
trying
new
styles
and
finding
them
to
be
more
refreshing
as
the
weather
warms
up
a
very
memorable
brew
that
i
will
surely
be
revisiting
soon
o
great
beer
it
is
an
allround
classic
with
no
flaws
it
has
a
spicy
crisp
light
taste
and
the
smell
and
appearance
to
go
with
it
o
an
exceptional
beer
has
a
few
quality
flavors
that
work
very
well
together
great
smell
and
fantastic
mouth
feel
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
this
out
again
in
the
near
future
the
flavour
of
this
beer
are
so
wellintegrated
that
it
was
tough
to
pinpoint
specifics
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
if
you
like
belgian
beers
you
will
like
this
one
perfect
example
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
highly
recommended
i
must
say
though
i
would
leave
the
yeast
out
of
this
one
i
had
some
with
out
the
yeast
and
with
the
yeast
and
the
yeast
diluted
some
of
the
flavors
of
the
beer
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
however
and
this
may
be
heresy
to
some
i
would
have
to
say
i
prefer
delirium
tremens
and
it
remains
my
favorite
belgium
strong
pale
ale
i
will
have
to
give
this
a
couple
more
tries
and
see
if
i
change
my
mind
overallthe
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
its
gone
before
a
blink
of
an
eye
so
drinkable
and
smooth
complex
but
easy
drinking
flavors
i
dont
drink
this
beer
enough
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
single
at
heb
today
while
grocery
shopping
dammit
i
want
another
o
wonderful
belgian
strong
pale
great
strong
flavors
with
a
perfect
crisp
mouthfeel
you
will
want
to
drink
glass
after
glass
a
must
try
o
i
like
it
its
honestly
a
good
drinker
and
a
great
summer
time
beer
belgians
arent
my
favorite
but
i
recommend
this
one
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
tastes
great
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
it
is
very
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
i
recommend
this
one
overall
a
good
solid
belgian
with
an
easy
drinkability
especially
noting
the
o
a
hell
of
a
beer
i
havent
bought
this
beer
in
awhile
since
the
price
increase
i
cant
believe

one
of
the

right
here
so

drinkable
even
at

abv
o
a
superb
beer
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
ive
had
duvel
many
times
now
and
its
always
a
treat
note
i
finally
got
a
hold
of
a
duvel
signature
glass
at
my
local
beer
store
and
considered
myself
lucky
until
i
actually
drank
from
it
the
constant
bubbling
from
the
laseretched
d
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
virtually
guarantees
that
your
beer
will
be
totally
flat

o
hard
to
beat
this
brew
for
a
bspa
o
serious
perfection
here
this
brew
is
the
work
of
craftsmanship
so
sweet
and
tasty
with
a
perfect
touch
of
hops
it
just
never
gets
boring
and
the
pairings
are
endless
d
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
a
staple
for
this
style
enough
said
overall
the
only
part
of
this
brew
that
didnt
overwhelm
was
the
aroma
but
even
that
was
still
better
than
most
4
5
of

very
well
with
this
beer
tastes
phenomenal
very

on
a
warm
day
o

highly
drinkable
and
flat
out
delicious
also
rumor
has
it
that
this

is
fairly
low
in
calories
especially
considering
the
abv
awesome

o
great
easy

awesome

and
drinkability
330
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
rudimentary
chalice
this
beer
is
just
gorgeous
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
frothy
head
big
belgiany
aroma
that
at
first
reminds
me
of
pineapple
smells
semisweet
almost
like
a
bread
dough
carbonation
translates
to
a
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
isnt
unpleasant
taste
is
of
lemon
grass
with
some
spicy
hop
character
in
the
background
malt
profile
is
deftly
handled
with
the
beer
sliding
more
to
the
bready
side
of
the
spectrum
taste
finishes
with
a
light
sourness
and
is
very
dry
theres
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
the
more
you
drink
it
but
thats
certainly
welcome
for
the
style
all
of
the
components
of
this
beer
are
harmonious
singing
together
to
create
a
symphonic
experience
a
classic
overall
quite
a
good
one
for
the
style
really
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
1oz
of
absinthe
overall
a
damn
fine
brew
i
can
see
this
going
extremely
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
warm
spring
afternoon
i
will
definitely
drink
it
again
classic
beer
with
good
reason
i
loved
it
the
first
time
and
after
having
a
lot
more
beers
my
opinion
is
not
diminished
at
all
it
calls
for
sip
after
sip
and
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
to
boot
capable
of
complementing
meals
in
addition
to
being
worthy
of
serious
study
on
its
own
d
medium
fairly
strong
overall
if
you
havent
tried
this
you
need
to
probably
the
pinnacle
of
this
style
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
am
almost
always
amazed
at
the
stuff
that
comes
out
of
belgium
and
this
is
no
exception
a
classic
a
classic
and
worthy
of
being
ranked
among
the
worlds
best
beers
the
flavours
are
both
intense
and
subtle
but
never
overwhelming
it
is
also
highly
affordable
and
should
be
on
every
beer
lovers
drinking
list
this
beer
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
a
true
classic
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
here
in
the
us
and
in
europe
and
it
is
always
consistant
and
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
i
have
tried
a
lot
of
other
beers
that
try
to
compare
but
this
is
truly
a
one
in
a
million
brews
very
hard
to
find
a
better
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
even
with
the
high
alcohol
looking
forward
to
enjoying
more
where
this
came
from
tart
and
refreshing
taste
an
apple
and
pear
flavor
with
herbal
hops
the
yeast
is
more
subtle
in
the
taste
drinks
softly
and
dryly
very
sweet
similar
to
a
pilsner
attacked
with
yeast
and
brewed
with
pears
the
carbonation
really
comes
into
play
in
the
mouthfeel
to
bring
the
smells
and
flavours
together
in
this
wellrounded
beer
its
quite
smooth
and
is
about
halfway
up
the
scale
for
dryness
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
much
more
than
i
paid
for
it
so
ill
be
coming
back
for
sure
great
stuff
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
happy
with
the
purchase
wish
they
gave
you
a
full
12
oz
instead
of
11
2
but
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
will
buy
again
overall
always
a
pleasure
i
intend
to
revisit
this
as
well
as
other
belgian
brews
but
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
mouthfeel
is
like
good
champagne
without
the
mineral
taste
highly
bubbly
your
eyes
dont
lie
and
a
warming
full
body
d
great
beer
whenever
asked
about
belgian
goldens
this
automatically
comes
to
mind
overall
an
exceptional
beer
a
world
class
beer
overall
duvel
is
a
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
it
is
very
sessionable
to
the
point
where
it
could
get
you
in
trouble
impossibly
drinkable
beer
sessionable
to
the
point
of
getting
into
trouble
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
colot
with
an
extremely
lofty
bubbly
white
head
it
smells
of
apple
and
apricot
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
tart
with
hints
of
green
apple
some
banana
and
a
leafy
bitter
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
but
full
bodied
with
lots
of
sharp
carbonation
its
warming
and
has
a
dry
finish
i
thought
the
duvel
was
great
id
drink
it
any
day
its
refreshing
and
light
enough
for
warm
weather
and
its
nice
and
warming
if
its
cool
outside
o
what
a
really
good
beer
very
flavorful
very
drinkable
really
enjoyed
it
d
given
the
abv
this
one
is
not
hard
to
drink
easy
even
hard
to
believe
for
me
actually
how
hyped
this
is
in
the
states
there
was
some
real
pressure
in
this
750ml
corked
bottle
opened
like
a
bottle
of
champagne
big
four
finger
head
of
soap
suds
looking
bubbles
pure
white
very
good
looking
lace
with
lots
of
clinging
power
the
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
but
dont
let
the
color
fool
you
this
is
some
fine
beer
not
a
light
beer
smell
is
a
bouquet
of
savory
fragrances
apple
spices
pepper
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
what
a
beer
should
taste
like
clean
tastes
of
apple
spices
sweet
malt
and
just
the
right
amount
of
citrus
very
creamy
and
full
feeling
in
my
mouth
as
i
savor
every
taste
warning
drinking
the
complete
750ml
bottle
at
one
setting
will
put
a
real
hurt
on
you
i
had
no
idea
by
the
flavor
that
this
beer
was
hiding
a
mule
kick
drink
this
wonderful
beer
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
for
a
good
three
hours
because
you
wont
want
to
do
anything
for
that
time
maybe
want
another
but
that
is
a
whole
new
story
d
easy
to
get
down
even
with
the
intense
carbonation
the
mild
flavor
contributes
considerably
to
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
did
like
it
more
than
the
first
time
i
tried
it
heres
hoping
that
trend
continues
next
time
drinkability
too
much
carbonation
in
combonation
with
bitterness
for
me
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
1
of
these
during
a
session
mediumthick
bodied
but
the
just
insane
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
makes
this
beer
feel
very
different
unlike
some
beers
that
become
creamy
form
that
carbonation
this
one
becomes
drier
as
a
result
d
awesome
on
this
maybe
better
with
some
age
than
fresh
smooth
flavourful
and
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
noticable
pours
a
pale
murky
yellow
lots
of
pure
white
foamy
head
smells
mildly
hoppy
with
lots
of
floral
and
citrus
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
hoppy
lots
of
citrus
and
some
light
bitterness
from
the
hops
vry
nice
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
light
clear
sparkling
yellow
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
a
soapy
yeast
herbal
hops
and
a
straw
malt
with
notes
of
a
blend
of
spices
it
tasted
light
and
mildy
acidic
in
the
beginning
and
finished
with
a
nice
light
bitter
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
waterydry
in
texture
overall
a
nice
light
tasty
refreshing
belgian
golden
ale
d

way
to
easily

very
nice
dworld
class
one
of
my
favorites
pour
into
a
glass
and
which
made
a
lot
of
head
not
a
lot
of
smell
when
swirled
but
the
little
bit
there
smells
sweet
initial
taste
is
light
and
smooth
the
after
taste
is
easy
without
much
flavor
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
beer
cheers
very
drinkable
this
was
the
first
belgian
beer
i
ever
liked
and
is
still
easily
one
of
my
favorite
readily
available
imports
ending
notes
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
that
ive
tried
of
the
style
would
get
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
best
taste
for
any
pale
ale
ive
had
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aftertaste
this
might
have
made
it
on
my
regular
rotation
but
grading
it
in
style
its
absolutely
great
a
headache
recipe
turn
the
duvel
tulip
glass
upside
down
and
place
on
top
of
the
bottle
then
invert
slowly
slowly
slowly
lift
the
bottle
up
for
the
perfect
head
ratio
repeat
about
23
times
over
the
course
of
an
evening
good
luck
tomorrow
i
always
try
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
on
hand
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
poured
into
what
else
a
duvel
tulip
with
a
bright
golden
color
and
a
beautiful
white
billowy
head
with
sticky
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
and
pleasant
with
belgian
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
light
and
crisp
with
esters
fruityness
a
bit
of
spice
and
the
faintest
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
light
with
lots
of
refreshing
carbonation
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
it
is
one
that
i
should
always
keep
on
hand
so
light
refreshing
complex
and
well
priced
drinkability
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
love
the
crisp
enticing
flavors
its
got
the
fresh
invigorating
appeal
of
just
cut
fruit
the
alcohol
flavor
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
you
know
right
away
youre
drinking
a
formidable
beer
but
it
doesnt
knock
you
over
the
head
right
away
when
i
imagine
lords
and
knights
gathered
around
a
thick
oak
table
enjoying
a
well
deserved
feast
after
battle
i
imagine
them
drink
duvel
duvel
is
a
masterpiece
dvery
cleanfresh
taste
but
it
also
had
alittle
too
much
yeast
flavor
and
was
alittle
off
for
me
might
have
just
been
a
bad
bottle
still
was
a
good
beer
but
felt
it
to
be
too
hyped
for
what
it
tasted
like
since
this
is
maybe
signature
belgian
at
its
finest
ill
spare
the
commentary
one
of
my
favorites
and
always
in
my
fridge
d
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
would
like
to
put
some
of
these
away
to
see
if
there
are
any
discernible
differences
but
this
one
fresh
is
delicious
as
well
this
is
an
excellent
and
flawless
beer
as
complex
as
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
is
but
yet
refreshing
with
a
very
nice
crispy
character
i
just
cant
see
why
so
many
people
put
this
in
the
same
league
with
the
worlds
best
this
beer
is
very
light
almost
goldend
in
color
but
not
cloudly
its
almost
a
champane
color
with
very
ample
head
pour
very
slow
and
careful
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
very
smooth
and
mellow
in
taste
exact
notes
are
hard
for
me
to
discribe
i
love
popping
the
cork
on
the
brew
d
who
would
ever
pass
up
a
chance
to
drink
one
of
the
best
ale
in
the
world
well
except
when
it
is
aligned
with
other
great
beer
then
it
is
hard
to
choose
i
know
this
is
a
standard
for
the
style
but
i
can
recall
being
underwhelmed
by
this
one
previously
but
not
this
time
extremely
attractive
nuanced
subtle
balanced
and
complex
a
very
impressive
brew
even
if
the
style
is
not
my
favorite
crystal
clear
golden
beer
with
a
tight
white
foam
head
the
beer
almost
appears
champagne
like
with
the
bubble
streams
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
fruity
undertones
and
over
decent
belgian
golden
ale
worth
the
price
meh
overall
decent
golden
ale
offering
drinkability
good
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
good
drinkability
the
head
and
retention
is
at
its
best
from
what
i
have
seen
but
it
would
look
far
more
impressive
if
it
wasnt
so
murky
this
is
only
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
beer
with
such
a
complex
taste
that
isnt
overpowering
in
any
individual
aspect
accompanied
by
a
mouthfeel
that
is
beyond
satisfying
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
great
beer
so
the
8
5
alc
vol
will
likely
catch
up
to
you
if
you
overindulge
poured
from
a
750
ml
into
duvel
glass
big
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
color
is
light
golden
and
little
chill
haze
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
fresh
grassy
hops
there
is
a
perceived
sweetness
on
the
nose
from
the
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
peppery
spiced
hops
followed
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
go
to
brew
when
you
want
to
drink
a
great
blonde
belgian
ale
incredible
beer
i
will
be
having
more
of
this
i
would
suggest
to
any
fan
of
beer
d
i
didnt
find
the
taste
here
all
that
interesting
or
unique
to
me
it
was
almost
like
a
slightly
more
flavorful
over
carbonated
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
high
carbonation
to
this
beers
credit
it
masks
the
abv
well
still
i
prefer
delerium
tremens
to
this
any
day
d
this
is
wonderful
all
around
it
is
a
glorious
experience
to
drink
this
out
of
its
own
glass
as
well
dis
this
really
8
5
the
alcohol
is
almost
a
nonfactor
in
this
beer
this
is
incredible
simply
stated
one
of
the
best
period
d
a
750ml
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
1
person
the
first
glass
went
down
extremely
easily
but
i
did
start
to
feel
the
effects
on
the
2nd
glass
and
final
pour
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
available
in
nh
i
can
see
the
smaller
bottles
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
somewhat
special
occasions
d
yeah
stuff
is
dangerous
could
put
back
4
four
pack
of
this
stuff
in
probably
minutes
the
8
5
is
there
sure
but
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
hide
it
oh
so
nicely
buy
this
beer
enjoy
it
in
the
propper
glass
and
enjoy
overall
what
to
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
if
you
love
beer
you
must
drink
this
one
buy
the
glass
buy
a
bottle
or
20
this
is
a
great
champagne
beer
drink
it
with
someone
special
the
cpj
drink
ability
is
very
good
even
though
the
abv
is
high
just
a
great
all
round
beer
very
tasty
beer
lots
of
interesting
flavors
here
the
alcohol
can
be
strong
at
times
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
also
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
light
bodied
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
it
seems
to
fit
in
perfectly
with
the
other
qualities
this
beer
has
its
incredibly
drinkable
great
brew
no
surprise
its
a
classic
world
class
and
a
triumph
of
modern
brewing
technology
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
one
of
the
top
3
in
the
entire
world
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
flavor
complex
beer
one
cannot
say
enough
great
things
about
this
beer
all
other
belgian
blondesgoldens
cannot
touch
this
one
thank
you
duvel
moortgat
for
this
gem
poured
young
and
correctly
crystal
clear
and
fresh
with
a
white
afro
of
head
scraped
straight
across
nice
hop
smell
without
the
tired
piney
stank
flavor
is
exactly
what
you
would
look
for
in
a
belian
devil
beer
lucifer
judas
etc
dry
quenching
lightly
spicy
and
yeasty
if
theres
a
comparison
chamagne
would
be
close
in
texture
id
argue
this
is
the
benchmark
model
as
theres
incredible
balance
here
having
had
aged
versions
i
prefer
the
fresh
version
much
more
for
drinkability
after
being
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
tour
of
this
brewery
the
beer
pouring
class
at
the
end
was
very
fun
free
beer
wasnt
bad
either
shhh
the
duvel
is
sleeping
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
amazing
how
readily
available
and
how
relatively
inexpensive
it
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
would
never
drink
in
my
home
without
that
tulip
glass
it
really
brings
the
tasting
experience
to
a
whole
other
level
i
cant
rate
this
very
high
and
probably
not
going
to
have
it
again
for
drinkability
cause
i
know
there
are
others
in
this
style
that
i
prefer
by
far
dvery
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
overall
what
a
great
beer
easily
one
of
my
top
20
to
25
beers
ive
ever
had
i
enjoy
so
many
aspects
of
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
its
complex
yet
approachable
its
easy
to
like
as
a
beginner
but
has
enough
going
on
to
be
equally
appreciated
by
a
any
drinking
veteran
im
definatley
a
fan
of
this
the
lasting
tastes
of
malty
hops
and
honey
just
fuels
the
desire
for
more
i
even
questioned
if
this
even
had
alcohol
in
it
you
can
hardly
taste
it
or
feel
it
a
perfect
beer
with
dinner
and
im
absolutely
going
to
be
drinking
this
in
the
future
only
complaint
is
the
bubbles
can
be
sometimes
too
tough
drinkability
it
became
easier
to
drink
the
more
i
had
a
good
all
around
beer
d
a
great
bspa
that
isnt
too
strong
this
one
could
be
an
every
day
beer
for
me
if
i
ever
had
a
staple
drinks
amazingly
well
for
8
5
d
all
day
all
night
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
its
complexity
at
first
when
judging
the
aroma
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
handle
on
the
flavoring
within
once
it
sat
for
a
while
and
we
sipped
it
really
opened
up
the
flavoring
which
was
an
interesting
mix
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
gave
the
drinker
a
good
deal
of
contrast
d
im
about
to
finish
the
bottle
so
i
guess
its
ok
nice
beer
for
summer
evenings
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easily
youll
be
wondering
where
that
8
5
alcohol
is
duvel
translates
as
devil
or
if
you
like
the
dish
with

dfinished
my
bottle
quick
and
looking
for
another
very
good
beer
and
will
definately
be
storing
a
couple
of
these
i
greatly
enjoy
this
beer
and
recommend
it
highly
drinkability
lots
of
aroma
hits
the
nose
with
champagnelike
carbonation
then
crisp
and
light
like
a
pilsner
yet
complex
like
an
ale
with
lingering
flavors
and
a
dry
rather
than
sweet
finish
so
there
are
a
lot
of
things
going
on
when
you
sip
on
this
beer
amazing
the
smell
and
taste
were
sweet
yeasty
peppery
and
spicy
like
lemon
peel
the
feel
was
crisp
and
the
ale
was
so
easy
to
drink
it
was
gone
in
no
time
there
was
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
however
it
does
not
hit
in
the
manner
expected
from
the
alcohol
content
duvel
is
delicious
and
deceptively
refreshing
as
good
as
belgian
ales
get
tremendously
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
fantastic
brew
all
the
way
around
d
i
could
drink
4
bottles
of
this
in
a
row
i
have
no
idea
how
they
did
it
at
8
5
abv
so
easy
to
drink
and
its
flavor
is
big
and
devine
all
the
way
to
the
end
very
good
beer
not
the
world
class
mana
from
heaven
that
seems
to
be
the
consensus
in
this
place
but
not
something
id
ever
be
upset
to
see
on
the
menu
the
quintessential
belgian
pale
it
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
took
a
long
time
to
recede
smelled
of
sugar
lemon
citrus
fruit
and
yeast
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
clove
and
spice
and
malts
and
hops
and
belgium
yeast
it
had
a
dessert
quality
about
it
this
is
the
grandaddy
of
belgium
pales
and
well
worth
it
always
a
treat
to
drink
with
the
high
abv
that
is
well
hidden
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
would
go
well
with
roasted
pork
but
i
had
it
with
grilled
chicken
with
a
champagne
sauce
not
a
bad
pairing
if
youre
into
beer
you
should
really
try
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
that
it
always
a
joy
to
have
d
highly
drinkable
great
with
meals
or
on
its
own
very
versatile
i
cant
believe
this
is
8
5
abv
it
drinks
like
45
exceptional
ive
known
about
this
beer
for
a
long
time
yet
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
wow
ive
been
missing
out
d
i
love
this
beer
it
brings
back
great
memories
of
my
trip
to
belgium
that
turned
me
on
to
beer
ill
never
forget
the
first
time
i
had
it
at
a
great
bar
where
people
willingly
came
over
to
speak
with
us
and
ask
us
where
we
were
from
always
brings
back
happy
thoughts
i
just
wish
nblc
liquor
stores
had
it
here
but
ill
be
satisfied
with
getting
ontario
friends
to
bring
it
to
me
at
8
5
it
always
makes
me
feel
good
and
its
something
i
could
always
have
again
a
true
classic
one
of
the
best
beers
that
is
widely
available
worldwide
some
notes
of
apple
great
lacing
in
the
goblet
and
good
carbonation
throughout
a
champion
beer
appearance
typical
for
the
style
smells
of
sweet
fruit
strawberries
and
a
slight
tartness
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
scent
as
well
the
flavor
followed
smell
sweet
tasting
delicious
with
a
little
bit
of
tart
fruit
and
yeast
strawberry
flavors
prevalent
and
a
great
mouth
feel
overall
a
delicious
brew
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
a
bit
too
easily
considering
the
alcohol
content
about
time
i
had
this
beer
dfor
this
beer
being
so
big
it
goes
down
very
smooth
it
says
on
the
four
pack
that
they
age
the
beer
before
they
release
it
maybe
thats
why
im
not
really
getting
any
alcoholness
in
this
its
very
nice
indeed
world
class
im
sure
be
sure
to
try
this
beer
if
not
yet
im
sure
ill
visit
this
beer
again
i
picked
up
the
duvel
glass
and
750ml
gift
set
and
let
it
age
for
a
month
or
two
what
a
difference
the
tulip
glassware
makes
after
sipping
on
this
for
a
while
i
had
to
amend
my
scores
from
the
last
sampling
simply
a
fantastic
brew
over
the
last
time
i
found
that
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
muted
a
big
plus
and
the
apple
and
yeast
were
more
pronounced
just
loving
it
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
one
that
im
glad
has
become
rather
mainstream
available
at
many
barscarryouts
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
quite
a
layered
flavor
profile
and
that
head
is
classic
sticking
around
until
the
bitter
end
what
a
difference
a
year
makes
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
all
about
here
anyone
who
says
they
dont
like
beer
hand
them
a
bottle
of
duvel
well
have
converts
for
sure
truth
drink
it
slow
and
savor
its
flavor
this
brew
is
pretty
exceptionally
drinkable
it
isnt
as
strong
as
i
thought
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
would
be
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
and
a
beer
id
love
to
have
again
hands
down
the
most
impressive
bottled
beer
ive
ever
had
duvel
seems
appropriate
to
me
almost
any
time
of
the
year
except
maybe
the
dog
days
of
summer
unless
youre
sitting
in
a
cold
room
drinking
this
lightly
chilled
mmmm
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
carbonation
and
sweetness
balance
out
quite
well
this
is
a
world
class
extraordinary
beer
wish
i
had
a
goodlooking
stranger
to
enjoy
this
with
as
the
label
suggests
but
then
i
would
need
more
than
one
750ml
bottle
normally
i
drink
this
beer
in
summer
as
a
thirstbuster
not
more
than
two
because
else
the
beer
is
like
its
name
a
real
devil
d
this
beer
is
truly
light
and
it
does
have
some
nice
complexity
in
flavor
the
buttery
corn
notes
as
it
warmed
seem
to
interfere
with
the
other
flavors
but
not
a
great
deal
the
head
is
simply
incredible
and
the
lace
just
last
and
last
this
is
one
fizzy
yellow
beer
that
is
wonderful
conclusion
a
classic
and
truly
worth
all
the
press
it
gets
not
something
i
drink
all
the
time
but
im
always
impressed
when
i
come
back
to
it
drinkability
excellent
definitely
will
drink
again
it
is
so
delicious
and
refreshing
i
dont
know
why
but
i
thought
this
beer
might
have
been
hyped
a
little
too
much
perhaps
because
its
so
available
after
trying
it
this
is
definitely
not
the
case
hugely
flavorful
and
complex
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
duvel
moortgat
if
i
get
the
opportunity
make
no
mistake
this
is
an
exceptional
beverage
this
is
one
every
beer
afficionado
should
try
over
and
over
schol
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
carbonation
and
sweetness
balance
out
quite
well
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
session
with
this
this
is
a
great
belgian
style
ale
that
is
also
widely
available
ive
seen
it
in
my
local
grocery
store
before
fantastic
easy
to
drink
hides
its
alcohol
well
sweet
and
citrusy
everything
a
light
colored
belgian
ale
should
be
extremely
drinkable
this
thing
is
a
pleasure
on
the
tastebuds
there
is
a
definite
warming
sensation
but
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
this
is
outstanding
i
am
very
pleased
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
have
but
not
entirely
sessionable
a
little
too
much
carbonation
and
at
8
1
i
dont
think
you
want
to
be
drinking
these
all
day
or
the
duvel
in
you
might
come
out
this
has
to
be
the
most
refreshing
beer
on
planet
earth
a
devil
of
a
beer
grainy
malt
and
alcohol
are
the
first
things
to
hit
my
palate
with
some
bready
yeast
coming
shortly
after
then
a
sharp
bitterness
at
the
end
accentuated
by
some
more
of
the
alcohol
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
high
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
the
quintessential
belgian
golden
ale
and
is
always
a
fun
beer
to
drink
the
fourpacks
do
not
last
very
long
in
my
fridge
d
pretty
good
for
the
high
abv
the
beer
isnt
very
boozy
just
spicy
so
it
makes
it
a
pretty
easy
drinker
d
a
pleasure
to
look
at
smells
wonderful
and
supertasty
very
very
drinkable
until
the
8
1
abv
gets
you
this
beer
was
recommended
to
by
by
a
little
shop
owner
who
thought
it
was
great
fun
to
tease
me
about
american
macros
he
was
great
though
and
this
is
the
first
of
a
long
line
of
recommendations
the
nice
gentleman
gave
me
expect
more
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
thirstquenching
beer
drinkability
this
is
so
good
its
not
unlike
champagne
in
the
taste
and
feel
it
forces
you
to
take
another
sip
the
8
is
well
hiddden
i
almost
always
have
to
have
2
this
is
a
good
brew
one
of
my
favorite
widely
available
beers
i
i
think
they
could
have
masked
the
alcohol
better
and
given
it
a
tad
less
carbonation
otherwise
go
out
and
buy
some
enjoy
drinkability
wow
i
think
that
about
sums
it
up
one
of
the
most
awesome
and
big
beers
for
me
till
now
got
it
here
finally
in
hoboken
nj
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
colour
was
a
pale
golden
with
a
great
white
head
plenty
of
bubbliness
evident
smelt
of
lemons
and
fruit
first
up
with
liitle
notes
of
grain
ok
the
beer
is
massive
on
taste
really
bitter
first
up
then
dissolving
into
grain
malt
and
slight
dryness
but
the
bitterness
just
stays
on
and
on
amazing
tenure
on
the
palate
keeps
you
wanting
for
more
and
more
superb
concelament
of
the
alcohol
great
beer
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
for
me
almost
too
delicious
but
not
quite
definitely
worth
its
accolades
definitely
worth
the
money
definitely
worth
having
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
would
definately
go
for
another
obviously
i
cannot
afford
to
drink
duvel
every
day
but
it
is
an
incredible
beer
one
that
you
measure
all
others
against
everything
that
accompanies
this
beer
is
amazing
from
the
bottle
to
the
glass
it
is
truly
an
experience
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
just
so
clean
and
balanced
that
it
never
overwhelms
your
palate
and
goes
down
amazingly
easily
not
in
the
least
bit
boozy
overall
just
a
plain
nofrills
welldone
belgian
ale
always
a
good
call
when
options
are
limited
or
even
when
they
arent
i
think
duvel
gets
a
slightly
bad
rap
because
it
is
becoming
more
available
just
because
my
local
grocery
store
carries
it
doesnt
mean
its
suddenly
bad
im
sure
point
beer
is
rare
in
belgium
maybe
theyll
make
a
trade
d
it
demands
respect
savory
tried
again

almost
a

i
keep
my
rating
right
around
where
it
is

very
enjoyable
beer
or
almost
with
flavor
profile
of
an
imperial

with
that
yummy
unique
belgian
twinge
a
real
enjoyable
beer
thats
complex
yet
quite
simple
easy
drinking
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
i
will
definitely
be
keeping
this
one
around
more
it
is
just

drinkable
it
is
just
so
well

i
am
really
amazed
by
this
beer
the
world
needs
to

duvel
i
will
recommend
this
to
anyone
im
really
glad
this
one
made
it
into
my
cart
the
andersons
dublin
ohio
has
this
beer
and
im
glad
they
do
one
other
note
if
youre
like
me
and
prefer
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
go
slow
with
this
one
it
produces
substantial
amounts
of
foam
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
waste
even
a
drop
of
this
delightful
beer
on
a
foamover
drinkability
not
amazing
but
very
quaffable
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
great
as
id
hoped
for
and
with
the
word
of
mouth
id
expected
a
bit
better
but
still
a
good
drinking
beer
that
at
the
right
price
im
sure
would
make
a
fantastic
introbeer
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
with
a
beautiful
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
4
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
a
ton
of
lacing
smell
is
of
apples
citrus
and
bananas
kind
of
like
a
hefeweizen
but
less
spice
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
some
pepper
some
spice
and
bananas
in
here
as
well
but
not
as
much
as
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
but
still
fairly
creamy
crisp
drinkability
is
good
especially
with
8
abv
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
generous
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
skin
the
aroma
is
fruity
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
blurring
the
taste
buds
feel
was
light
bodied
but
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
was
above
average
i
had
750
ml
bottle
and
could
have
gone
another
nice
pleasant
beer
that
didnt
knock
me
out
not
grossly
overpriced
like
some
of
the
belgians
id
happily
have
it
again
late
note
as
i
reach
the
end
of
the
bottle
and
it
warms
i
find
my
opinion
of
the
taste
raising
a
half
notch
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
overall
its
a
great
example
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
its
flavorful
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
the
lack
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
makes
this
brew
dangerous
but
delicious
d
wow
give
me
another
because
i
finished
this
one
in
less
than
10
minutes
refreshing
like
a
pils
tasty
yeast
like
a
wheat
mouthfeel
like
a
strong
ale
this
beer
deserves
the
praise
it
gets
served
in
a
duvel
glass
the
beer
pours
a
fizzy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
i
get
big
lemon
and
lime
notes
with
a
dose
of
sugar
and
spice
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lighter
with
with
citrus
and
spice
dry
and
crisp
flavor
this
beer
is
truly
classic
happy
birthday
to
me
this
is
an
excellent
beer
cheers
d
really
nice
at
8
00
a
bottle
for
750ml
not
bad
gicen
the
smootheness
will
not
turn
one
down
d
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
beer
whenever
i
see
it
im
going
to
have
to
really
give
it
a
strong
consideration
now
highly
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
d
for
the
high
abv
this
goes
down
without
a
hitch
if
it
werent
for
the
price
i
would
drink
a
lot
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
cheers
duvel
will
remain
a
standard
in
my
cellar
for
its
drinkability
and
the
pleasent
experience
of
sipping
it
over
dinner
on
the
deck
in
the
cooling
fall
evening
am
i
missing
something
everyone
thinks
this
beer
is
so
great
but
i
dont
get
it
theres
nothing
i
would
fault
this
beer
for
but
theres
really
nothing
particularly
notable
about
it
either
i
mean
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
find
myself
having
nothing
to
say
about
no
impulse
to
exclaim
or
anything
when
i
drink
it
theres
nothing
even
remotely
surprising
about
it
i
guess
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
given
its
high
alcohol
content
but
really
its
pretty
standard
as
i
said
im
not
faulting
this
beer
but
i
just
dont
understand
how
it
got
an
a
overall
and
an
a
from
the
brothers
again
im
willing
to
accept
the
possibility
that
im
missing
something
overall
i
dont
know
how
you
could
improve
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
unbelievably
smooth
balanced
and
complex
theres
also
no
way
of
telling
from
the
tatse
that
this
is
a
big
beer
drinkability
if
i
had
a
big
bottle
of
this
stuff
or
access
to
it
on
tap
i
could
see
myself
getting
into
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
for
an
8
5
beer
it
just
goes
down
incredibly
easily
its
creamy
tasty
and
just
an
allround
great
beer
hennepen
a
nice
framboise
and
duvel
have
been
my
introductions
to
the
world
of
belgian
beers
some
good
friends
of
mine
gave
my
wife
and
i
two
duvel
gift
sets
the
ones
with
the
duvel
glass
for
our
25th
anniversary
this
past
weekend
and
im
looking
forward
to
letting
them
age
a
bit
like
the
one
i
just
reviewed
then
again
i
may
not
be
able
to
wait
these
are
simply
delicious
beers
d
taste
similar
to
champagne
this
is
something
to
sip
and
enjoy
though
the
bitter
pine
taste
seems
too
strong
overall
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
certainly
a
classic
and
a
great
example
nonetheless
in
my
opinion
certainly
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
d
absolutely
refreshing
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
with
a
beautiful
light
yellow
haze
and
a
thick
white
foam
for
a
head
that
lingers
until
the
end
smells
of
sweet
breadmalts
taste
starts
off
as
sweet
and
sour
but
ends
up
dry
and
alcoholy
the
head
makes
it
a
bit
thicker
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
evident
pretty
good
overall
even
with
an
abv
of
8
5
the
alcohol
wasnt
really
that
strong
compared
to
others
of
a
similar
level
final
thoughts
this
clearly
a
beer
for
the
beer
enthusiast
and
not
your
average
drinker
its
good
yes
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
honestly
reminds
me
of
champagne
in
that
yes
it
is
good
but
only
in
small
doses
you
should
try
this
beer
at
least
once
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
ale
if
its
alcohol
content
wasnt
so
high
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
night
until
the
8
5
abv
puts
me
out
off
the
charts
d
sky
high
too
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
so
smooth
and
balanced
the
8
5
is
very
well
hidden
even
though
you
do
catch
in
in
the
aroma
that
said
it
is
best
enjoyed
as
a
sipper
drinkability
a
sipper
but
oh
so
wonderful
probably
the
best
beer
to
pass
my
lips
so
far
in
my
young
life
d
i
like
to
think
this
is
a
sipper
but
i
drink
them
a
little
faster
than
i
should
i
e
can
usually
drink
more
than
one
love
belgian
ale
and
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
faves
dont
think
i
will
ever
go
without
having
a
couple
in
my
cellar
drink
it
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
not
my
favourite
because
of
the
smell
but
will
never
refuse
one
ps
the
tulip
glass
rules
it
really
heightened
the
whole
experience
for
me
i
would
recommend
this
beer
dso
drinkable
oh
so
drinkable
delightfully
drinkable
complex
and
smooth
a
classic
brew
with
good
reason
i
opened
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
the
other
day
and
forgot
about
it
in
my
fridge
i
used
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
its
still
fully
carbonated
mouthfeel
exhibits
a
lot
of
active
carbonation
and
overall
very
crisp
a
classic
belgian
ale
and
all
around
very
refreshing
drinkability
stuffs
great
would
been
even
better
if
it
was
slightly
less
bitter
afterwards
d
this
is
an
exceptionally
crafted
beer
and
that
shows
in
the
drinkability
im
almost
done
and
i
crave
another
dr
easy
crisp
clean
delightful
d
amazingly
so
if
not
for
the
price
would
be
my
go
to
beer
this
beer
leaves
a
grin
on
my
face
every
time
pure
liquid
pleasure
anyway
this
beer
is
absolutely
bonkers
you
definitely
have
to
try
it
wonder
whats
it
like
if
its
aged
m
light
on
the
mouth
vary
nice
had
this
in
a
duvel
tulip
glass
i
love
the
foam
this
beer
produces
and
the
way
it
lingers
its
like
having
a
puffy
cloud
above
the
beer
that
enhances
the
whole
experience
duvel
has
a
champangelike
richness
to
it
that
the
carbonation
enhances
into
by
making
it
creamy
and
frothy
a
really
special
beer
that
stands
out
among
other
beers
within
its
style
due
to
its
complex
rich
chewy
texture
balanced
by
a
subtle
biterness
of
saaz
and
styrian
golding
hops
its
delicious
drinkability
im
glad
i
had
it
but
this
is
a
beer
for
sitting
back
and
savoring
not
really
making
me
want
another
one
is
good
enough
another
beer
that
i
havnt
tried
for
ages
and
just
wanted
an
excuse
to
try
it
again
so
thought
id
buy
it
and
review
iti
love
the
shape
of
this
bottle
its
so
original
and
have
never
see
another
beer
come
close
to
this
beer
as
establishing
its
look
that
everyone
knows
yet
keeping
its
own
statusthis
beer
pours
a
sparkling
yellow
semi
hazy
colour
which
leaves
a
nice
three
finger
frothybubbly
head
it
is
so
full
of
bubbles
eventually
the
froth
mound
sort
of
collapes
to
a
big
frothy
mound
in
the
middle
with
loads
of
prominent
lacing
all
down
the
glassthe
smell
is
fresh
applespearswhite
grapes
and
candy
not
a
hint
of
alcoholthe
taste
is
very
fruity
with
some
hints
of
yeasty
characters
which
leaves
you
with
a
nice
full
breadycaramelish
finish
on
the
pallete
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
on
your
first
taste
but
after
my
second
sip
i
dont
taste
it
again
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
still
cant
believe
is
8
5
it
goes
down
that
easy
and
in
saying
that
thats
probably
the
only
reason
i
wouldnt
drink
to
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
definately
appreciate
this
beer
d
wow
sooo
drinkable
nothing
harsh
about
this
beer
anywhere
just
watch
it
drinks
too
easy
for
a
beer
with
a
8
5
abv
nevertheless
i
could
knock
back
many
of
these
m
very
crisp
and
dry
like
champagne
a
tasty
drinkable
brew
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
giving
a
large
bubbled
white
head
of
only
about
1
5
fingers
much
less
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
poured
it
slow
the
smell
was
of
grains
and
yeast
funk
with
most
of
the
intricacies
in
the
yeast
funk
the
grain
was
plain
somewhat
bland
in
both
aroma
and
in
taste
giving
a
vague
note
of
frutiness
it
seemed
a
tad
like
wine
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
taste
some
green
grapes
in
their
with
the
yeast
funk
that
reminded
me
of
a
very
very
laid
back
lambic
the
mouthfeel
was
bitter
crisp
refreshing
and
full
all
at
the
same
time
and
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
it
was
rather
drinkable
but
i
found
it
to
be
bland
although
it
did
hide
its
alcohol
well
the
taste
is
unique
and
has
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
at
almost
10
its
a
fav
to
drink
regularly
drinkability
its
not
too
bad
i
guess
i
have
found
a
preference
for
other
belgians
though
that
dont
have
quite
the
bitter
preference
its
got
a
nice
flavor
and
a
beautiful
appearance
but
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
plus
its
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
this
is
very
drinkable
except
for
the
high
abv
which
sneaks
up
on
you
after
two
beers
poured
a
golden
color
with
an
extremely
full
white
head
which
suprised
me
the
smell
was
mildly
fruity
very
mild
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
at
all
it
tasted
of
over
fermented
apples
it
freaked
me
out
because
i
thought
it
was
bad
but
my
dad
said
it
was
delicious
when
i
made
him
taste
it
was
alot
more
full
in
body
then
i
expected
but
it
was
hard
to
get
over
the
disctracting
taste
i
wouldnt
drink
this
on
the
regular
maybe
i
need
to
work
my
way
up
to
it
in
the
belgian
world
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
yet
smooth
and
velvety
its
a
joy
to
drink
on
a
final
note
a
legendary
beer
what
can
i
say
understandably
a
classic
but
take
it
slow
drinkability
the
sticking
lace
shows
my
quick
progress
ill
have
another
but
might
pay
for
it
in
the
morning
overall
there
are
very
few
beers
that
i
associate
with
the
face
of
a
style
duvel
is
what
i
think
of
when
somebody
mentions
a
belgian
strong
pale
or
golden
ale
everything
i
drink
in
that
category
i
find
myself
comparing
to
this
beer
its
hard
for
me
to
think
of
a
way
to
improve
this
beer
as
far
as
the
standard
belgian
beers
go
i
like
duvel
over
chimay
or
hoegaarden
you
can
get
it
anywhere
in
belgium
and
many
places
throughout
europe
as
well
as
in
the
usa
duvel
has
an
attractive
thick
and
creamy
head
the
flavor
is
rich
yet
the
beer
itself
by
my
estimation
is
relatively
light
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
it
hits
you
hard
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
slowly
and
appreciated
tastes
like
the
quintessential
belgian
pale
spice
and
green
apple
with
a
yeasty
buffer
and
expansive
drying
quality
if
this
is
truly
8
5
abv
im
a
monkeys
uncle
always
a
good
choice
i
was
impresses
that
the
hotel
bar
had
this
and
chimay
red
to
offer
d
excellent
beer
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
my
first
experience
drinking
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
i
must
say
for
the
2nd
time
around
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
it
yet
it
s
a
must
try
d
i
hardly
noticed
the
alcohol
and
could
drink
this
all
night
a
nice
sipper
and
flavors
are
just
so
pleasant
the
well
balanced
alcohol
is
deadly
i
can
feel
this
one
bottle
going
to
my
head
already
but
the
alcohol
is
so
well
balanced
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
one
to
many
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
feel
a
little
tipsy
from
a
single
bottle
not
really
a
session
beer
but
so
damned
tasty
and
quaffable
you
wish
it
was
d
i
could
drink
this
every
day
for
breakfast
d
beware
the
devil
will
get
you
take
your
time
and
you
will
be
in
heavan
too
many
and
it
is
a
night
in
hell
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
refreshing
yet
relatively
high
gravity
beer
an
excellent
combination
of
potency
taste
and
refreshment
d
not
my
first
duvel
and
will
not
be
my
last
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
chimay
becasue
of
the
complexity
of
it
being
a
pale
ale
as
unique
as
any
good
wine
is
the
8
5
is
not
a
big
deal
with
this
beer
as
other
belgian
beers
can
be
do
not
get
the
strong
alchohol
taste
that
other
belgian
beers
have
that
is
what
sets
it
a
part
from
others
it
can
be
a
session
beer
and
it
can
be
a
savored
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorites
poured
into
duvel
tulip
crystal
clear
yellow
gold
with
much
bubbling
and
a
tight
foamy
head
and
thick
lacing
smell
is
spicy
toasty
malty
yeasty
bready
fruity
taste
is
crisp
and
clear
straightforward
spicy
and
toasty
cutting
sour
pungent
mouthfeel
is
very
biting
and
tight
drinkability
is
great
it
really
is
a
beautiful
sight
to
behold
lots
of
lacing
to
boot
the
nose
is
full
of
citrus
and
light
spicing
along
with
some
dry
grains
the
taste
is
well
hopped
slightly
metallic
upfront
but
melting
into
a
pleasant
bitterness
with
abundant
graininess
cloves
and
cinnamon
hints
are
very
pleasurable
theres
also
a
lot
of
fruit
in
there
perhaps
peach
and
pear
good
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
good
drinkability
over
all
its
a
great
beer
balance
is
the
key
word
here
my
two
criticisms
are
that
its
a
bit
too
spirity
and
the
alcohol
could
be
masked
more
and
personally
just
a
tad
less
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
this
is
a
beer
that
im
sure
i
will
buy
and
enjoy
again
some
time
soon
well
in
all
my
years
i
have
never
poured
anything
like
this
before
half
the
pilsner
is
a
very
light
very
clear
gold
color
and
the
other
half
is
the
head
half
the
pilsner
is
head
i
said
i
do
not
know
how
to
grade
this
i
am
at
a
loss
for
any
analysis
i
am
just
going
to
have
to
take
a
stab
at
looks
the
smell
is
great
smell
of
very
fresh
hops
in
something
that
promises
to
be
potent
as
i
try
to
pour
the
rest
of
the
beer
here
we
go
again
head
out
the
yinyang
am
i
ever
going
to
drink
this
beer
finally
the
taste
not
impressed
very
weak
can
taste
the
massive
carbonation
as
if
it
was
campaign
not
beer
no
aftertaste
at
all
very
fresh
very
very
drinkable
but
drink
a
domestic
light
if
you
want
a
buzz
verdict
try
at
your
own
risk
taste
is
representative
of
what
one
comes
to
love
about
the
style
slightly
sweet
crisp
a
little
offdry
but
very
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
vivid
appropriately
carbonated
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
period
i
know
its
much
ballyhooed
but
it
is
also
a
classic
of
the
style
for
a
reason
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
smooth
tasty
and
easy
going
for
this
much
alcohol
i
would
definitely
have
another
and
recommend
this
to
others
spritzy
and
spicy
are
the
first
impressions
like
there
is
coriander
and
thyme
in
here
strong
yeast
and
wheat
flavors
the
body
is
moderate
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
deceptively
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favs
ive
been
saving
this
one
until
i
felt
i
could
truly
appreciate
it
and
now
that
ive
tried
over
350
different
beers
i
think
i
may
be
ready
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
snifter
with
one
of
the
biggest
pillowy
white
heads
ive
ever
seen
i
love
how
it
settles
down
into
a
small
fluffy
foam
glacier
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
it
smells
nice
with
some
biscuity
malt
belgian
yeast
and
a
hint
of
lemon
it
tastes
light
and
refreshing
definitely
a
great
summer
beer
it
feels
pretty
carbonated
but
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
of
all
the
belgian
and
belgianstyle
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
is
probably
the
best
its
light
and
crisp
and
very
well
done
you
can
taste
the
quality
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
stong
the
abv
is
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
nose
is
bready
yeast
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
boom
alcohol
upfront
with
fruits
bread
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
warm
the
abv
is
pretty
prominent
drinkability
is
good
but
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
to
many
of
these
just
not
my
thing
d
almost
immediately
seducing
and
intoxicating
and
being
so
damn
hard
to
come
by
at
least
at
a
price
not
ranging
400
the
original
where
i
live
they
are
well
treasured
and
a
favorite
mouthfeel
medium
thin
in
the
mouth
this
seems
like
a
good
summer
beer
for
the
hoply
inclined
very
drinkable
dangerous
as
hell
no
wonder
they
call
it
the
devil
verdict
duvel
is
truly
a
brilliant
beer
and
thoroughly
stands
up
to
its
rather
lofty
reputation
if
youre
looking
to
start
your
journey
through
the
fascinating
world
belgian
beers
you
certainly
wont
go
wrong
with
this
as
your
first
step
a
classic
in
all
regards
i
dont
know
if
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
or
what
i
bought
this
today
after
reading
all
these
great
reviews
but
cant
say
i
feel
the
same
way
i
definitely
didnt
think
it
was
bad
i
just
really
wasnt
blown
away
at
all
i
do
remember
having
this
last
year
once
and
feeling
the
same
way
about
it
mostly
indifferent
i
kind
of
feel
like
im
missing
out
what
am
i
missing
here

0
well
made
and
tasty
would
drink
again
my
first
ever
belgian
ale
right
before
the
yank
memorial
day
weekend
and
im
definitely
feeling
it
the
ale
that
is
i
have
gained
a
level
combined
with
spicy
tacos
and
not
a
good
choice
beer
became
bitterer
lager
would
have
beer
better
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
feel
its
a
drink
that
would
grow
on
me
even
more
as
i
get
used
to
its
particular
bitterness
i
can
and
have
consume
this
all
day
the
alcohol
is
almost
nonapparent
this
is
a
classic
beer
and
it
can
be
enjoyed
anywhere
any
time
overall
an
excellent
beer
truly
the
best
of
the
style
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
beer
wherever
i
can
find
it
cheers
everyone
serving
suggestion
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
an
authentic
duvel
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
nice
champagne
type
beer
that
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
carbination
but
did
not
leave
the
palete
to
overwelmed
good
drinkability
but
i
feel
i
may
need
to
give
this
another
try
it
did
not
meet
expectations
in
case
youre
wondering
its
still
phenomenal
from
a
bottle
a
true
classic
that
somehow
always
ends
up
in
my
shopping
cart
when
i
go
to
trader
joes
it
works
great
as
a
year
round
beer
one
of
these
days
i
will
get
around
to
aging
a
few
and
see
how
they
turn
out
notes
this
is
definitely
the
gold
standard
for
which
bspas
should
be
measured
having
had
this
several
times
before
but
reviewing
it
for
the
first
time
here
i
can
say
that
this
one
deserves
all
of
the
accolades
it
receives
also
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
9
for
a
750
yes
please
anyhow
good
but
dangerous
beer
as
for
the
strong
belgian
pale
ales
duvel
is
thy
master
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
i
am
probably
not
able
to
appreciate
this
as
much
as
others
may
however
it
is
still
evident
that
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
great
brew
which
i
am
glad
i
saved
for
review
number
100
d
scary
drinkable
addictive
and
refreshing
and
8
5
overall
this
might
be
1
in
my
books
as
far
as
taste
and
drinkability
drinkability
is
also
great
i
could
have
probably
sucked
down
the
entire
750
ml
if
it
werent
for
the
other
guys
i
had
to
share
it
with
finishes
clean
on
my
palate
with
a
bit
of
dryness
my
mouth
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
the
flavor
is
so
light
and
refreshing
that
it
is
deceiving
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
this
is
probably
the
most
sessionable
beer
i
have
had
over
8
33cl
bottle
from
systembolaget
pale
yellow
with
a
crystal
clear
body
if
you
pour
it
right
champagne
carbonation
trails
and
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
a
lasting
layer
of
foam
very
pilsener
like
aroma
with
saaz
and
pale
malt
but
an
amazing
tart
citrus
and
pear
character
blends
in
too
fruity
sweet
and
tart
all
the
same
with
yeast
and
alcohol
following
elegant
hop
balance
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
the
body
is
suprisingly
light
and
delicate
for
a
beer
this
strong
im
suprised
at
how
easily
it
goes
down
very
enjoyable
and
displays
plenty
of
unique
character
compared
to
other
belgians
ive
had
appearance
is
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
good
deal
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
and
a
thick
white
foamy
head
smells
of
cirtrus
and
has
a
somewhat
champagnelike
quality
on
the
palate
very
clean
somewhat
citrusy
warming
alcohol
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
even
at
a
moderately
high
abv
wow
last
time
i
had
a
duvel
was
roughly
68
months
ago
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
flavorful
maybe
my
tastes
have
changes
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
then
im
not
sure
but
what
i
know
for
certain
now
is
that
this
is
a
killer
brew
and
deservedly
one
of
the
best
belgians
on
the
market
bravo
would
definitely
recommend
and
look
forward
to
drinking
the
remaining
three
bottles
d
great
this
is
a
great
belgian
brew
i
willl
revisit
this
one
again
probably
when
i
have
a
belgian
night
with
some
friends
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
i
feel
almost
silly
not
giving
this
all5s
as
it
pretty
much
is
the
definition
of
its
style
just
a
great
beer
and
one
i
dont
have
nearly
enough
so
carbonated
that
the
cork
popped
out
without
me
touching
it
and
shot
30
feet
in
the
air
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
very
large
head
the
smell
is
peppery
yeasty
a
lemony
the
taste
has
some
peppery
spice
to
it
with
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
extremely
bright
carbonation
drinkability
is
exceptional
for
an
8
50
beer
worthy
of
its
following
and
being
the
standard
by
which
all
other
strong
pales
are
measured
against
i
dont
know
if
id
say
it
was
the
best
but
its
sure
up
there
d
exceedingly
drinkablethis
will
be
a
standby
during
the
summer
months
a
progenitor
of
the
style
for
very
good
reason
once
past
the
aggravating
opening
theatrics
everything
just
goes
so
very
smoothly
for
such
an
alcoholic
pale
ale
so
much
so
that
one
might
inadvisably
be
inclined
to
make
a
night
of
this
i
would
suggest
looking
up
the
names
literal
meaning
before
deciding
on
such
a
course
of
action
when
i
first
tasted
it
in
the
80s
i
was
defenately
impressed
with
it
and
i
still
am
today
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
there
is
not
too
much
i
can
say
that
has
not
already
been
said
about
it
i
may
just
have
to
have
one
now
i
havent
found
another
i
like
as
well
my
affinity
for
this
one
has
earned
me
the
fancy
beer
guy
moniker
from
sweet
anna
at
millers
yes
i
figured
she
deserves
props
pour
is
a
light
golden
crisp
clear
with
a
magnificent
tight
white
head
smell
of
straw
a
mild
belgian
sugar
cane
and
apples
palate
is
simple
with
a
wonderful
carbonation
a
light
floral
astringent
crisp
straw
malt
apples
lemon
mint
that
tingles
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
a
dry
pepper
with
mid
bitter
one
of
crispest
for
the
alcohol
content
which
is
well
hidden
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
expected
and
i
like
chimay
much
better
but
still
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
deasy
to
enjoy
the
750ml
possibly
even
two
any
more
might
be
a
stretch
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
such
a
classic
its
exceptional
allaround
this
beer
looks
very
light
and
pretty
clear
its
a
light
golden
color
and
has
a
very
cloudy
soapy
head
that
hangs
around
the
smell
is
very
floral
and
sweet
and
has
a
sweet
yeast
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
it
finishes
somewhat
dry
but
the
hops
arent
overpowering
by
any
means
generally
a
light
sweet
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
oh
so
well
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
goes
down
very
easy
like
i
said
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
i
dont
know
how
i
could
suggest
any
modifications
to
this
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
overall
a
simply
great
beer
the
best
i
have
had
of
its
style
and
just
simply
delicious
a
must
try
d
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
but
duvel
certainly
is
worthy
of
its
place
within
this
style
of
which
i
buy
a
lot
of
replicas
of
which
do
not
compare
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
which
is
o
k
by
me
but
a
tad
to
much
carbonation
mouthfeeldrinkability
carbonation
is
high
and
the
body
is
medium
tastes
slighly
sweet
but
not
too
woth
lots
of
different
fruit
tastes
to
baffle
the
toungue
beautiful
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amont
of
carbonation
and
zing
the
ultimate
belgian
pale
for
a
reason
this
was
the
first
belgian
beer
i
ever
had
many
many
years
ago
while
visiting
a
friend
in
brussels
and
it
not
only
became
one
of
my
favorites
beers
but
it
made
me
curious
about
other
belgian
styles
d
really
nice
brew
that
is
highly
drinkable
watch
that
abv
spectacular
beer
maybe
i
have
too
many
good
local
microbreweries
with
plenty
of
belgians
to
choose
from
but
i
was
utterly
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
prefer
a
sweet
beligian
so
maybe
if
you
enjoy
a
tasteless
flavorless
nondescript
belgian
ale
then
this
is
definitely
the
beer
for
you
if
you
dont
have
local
belgians
try
urthel
before
you
try
this
this
beer
is
really
way
overrated
on
this
website
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
it
is
just
so
light
and
refreshing
with
the
alcohol
hidden
so
well
excellent
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
surrounding
it
poured
from
its
trademark
stubby
bottle
into
a
wine
chalice
bright
pale
golden
in
appearance
somewhawt
opaque
with
a
pillowy
white
head
thick
and
creamy
up
top
an
endless
supply
of
bubbles
make
their
way
towards
the
head
and
last
til
the
beer
is
no
more
and
remind
me
of
champagne
head
remained
until
the
very
end
as
well
a
beautiful
beer
smells
yeasty
accompanied
by
alcohol
smells
a
bit
dry
not
noticing
much
fruit
or
sweetness
on
the
nose
taste
is
crisp
as
can
be
from
start
to
finish
classic
belgian
yeast
flavors
a
little
hint
of
citrus
sweetness
and
definitive
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
on
the
end
of
each
sip
is
enjoyable
and
lasts
forever
i
finished
the
beer
15
minutes
ago
and
the
bitterness
is
just
now
leaving
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
at
the
beginning
then
it
feels
fairly
juicy
in
the
middle
excellent
burp
inducing
carbonation
all
over
the
place
scores
ok
for
drinkability
i
would
not
be
able
to
rush
through
these
but
3
or
4
wouldnt
be
too
much
a
task
and
would
be
all
you
need
very
well
crafted
beer
the
heat
at
the
end
of
every
couple
of
sips
lets
you
know
how
boozy
it
is
but
it
wont
take
you
long
to
eschew
your
responsibilities
and
continue
to
plumb
the
depths
this
beer
offers
so
overwhelmingly
good
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
stop
d
this
is
a
fanatically
delicious
beer
i
had
heard
good
thing
about
his
beer
and
it
more
than
lived
up
to
the
buzz
i
believe
this
is
huge
crowd
pleaser
super
smooth
yet
so
much
flavor
the
drinkability
is
a
knock
because
you
cannot
have
too
many
in
a
row
d
i
found
duvel
to
be
good
but
not
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
just
a
strong
and
simple
belgian
blonde
in
my
book
the
glass
is
by
far
the
best
thing
about
the
whole
package
while
i
appreciate
its
good
looks
the
taste
just
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
and
i
find
it
to
be
average
at
best
about
as
close
to
american
lager
as
you
can
get
in
a
belgian
ale
taste
wise
and
isnt
that
really
what
its
all
about
it
was
duvel
that
kicked
open
the
door
to
the
world
that
michael
jackson
wrote
about
a
world
of
great
beers
great
understanding
and
great
friends
and
for
that
reason
it
will
always
remain
in
my
mind
as
the
best
beer
there
are
not
enough
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
my
favorite
belgian
ale
trappist
excluded
i
have
to
pour
it
very
slowly
because
the
head
of
this
beer
can
get
out
of
control
quick
a
full
galss
of
duvel
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
sites
to
see
and
has
become
the
standard
of
how
a
belgian
ale
should
look
with
it
large
flavorful
head
the
smell
is
very
spicy
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
slight
bite
to
it
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
especially
my
favorite
the
buffalo
chicken
sandwich
at
the
abbey
in
providence
d
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
the
8
5
abv
is
well
hidden
i
think
i
waited
too
long
to
try
this
one
i
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
ill
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
the
alcohol
is
present
on
the
tongue
but
not
over
powering
really
a
great
taste
very
smooth
going
down
vague
fruity
and
floral
notes
notes
what
a
gorgeous
beer
totally
lives
up
to
its
reputation
extremely
easy
drinking
despite
the
carbonation
delicious
fruitiness
totally
disappears
from
your
mouth
once
you
swallow
i
know
i
gave
it
all
5s
but
i
just
didnt
know
where
to
compromise
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
strong
golden
should
be
overall
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
beer
has
something
for
everybody
go
find
some
if
you
havent
had
it
before
worth
the
wait
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
what
can
a
poor
beer
journeyman
like
myself
say
about
a
beer
like
this
that
hasnt
been
said
top
notch
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
has
a
smooth
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
resampleiftap
lingering
astringency
with
this
beer
slight
medicinal
notes
that
overshadow
the
finish
of
the
beer
i
wish
i
didnt
have
a
120
mile
round
trip
just
to
be
able
to
buy
this
beer
if
it
werent
for
that
i
would
always
have
at
least
a
couple
of
bottles
on
hand
drinkability
im
torn
on
this
one
it
tastes
outstanding
and
the
light
flavors
make
me
want
to
drink
this
quickly
but
the
prickly
carbonation
and
high
alcohol
say
otherwise
this
beer
would
be
almost
perfect
if
it
were
lower
in
abvcarbonation
making
it
easier
to
drink
or
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
more
full
regardless
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
will
likely
constantly
keep
on
hand
notes
to
be
honest
im
sad
that
ive
waited
this
long
to
try
such
a
highly
touted
brew
one
of
michael
jacksons
top
five
beers
in
the
world
this
is
definitely
something
that
everyone
should
get
a
taste
of
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
im
so
glad
i
bought
it
but
sad
that
i
only
got
one
bottle
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
in
the
future
poured
into
a
stemless
wineglass
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
long
time
the
way
a
belgian
should
good
amount
of
bubbles
but
the
carbonation
isnt
evident
in
the
mouthfeel
smell
isnt
as
strong
as
i
expected
but
the
normal
spices
are
present
the
taste
is
a
nice
spiced
hop
bite
but
not
too
strong
for
a
bspa
its
very
well
balanced
d
easy
but
after
the
third
glass
it
lost
its
strong
ale
taste
and
adopted
a
taste
similar
to
a
triple
maybe
this
was
just
my
palate
drinkability
great
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
if
i
saw
it
pours
an
almost
hazy
but
mostly
clear
yellowgolden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
head
collapses
leaving
a
little
lacing
and
a
thin
puff
of
bubbles
stays
on
top
the
whole
time
the
smell
is
nice
powdery
pilsener
malts
some
light
sugary
smells
but
not
a
very
intense
sweetness
a
very
faint
earthy
spiciness
from
the
noble
hops
the
taste
comes
across
first
with
some
nice
pleasant
pilsener
malt
then
the
noble
hops
kick
in
with
some
minty
almost
peppery
spice
with
a
nice
earthy
finish
theres
a
nice
struggle
between
sweetness
and
dryness
in
the
finish
and
i
enjoyed
the
battle
very
nice
right
on
could
maybe
play
more
to
some
more
raisiny
bready
malts
but
still
a
standard
for
taste
id
say
the
carbonation
is
sharp
on
the
tongue
which
is
kind
of
normal
for
a
bspa
the
beer
itself
is
kind
of
right
on
too
not
too
heavythick
or
too
lightthin
good
the
drinkability
is
good
too
the
alcohol
warms
a
bit
as
you
go
on
but
really
you
hardly
notice
it
and
this
one
can
go
down
quick
and
easy
d
id
love
to
drink
these
all
night
they
go
down
that
easily
i
would
pass
out
eventually
drinkability
is
moderate
it
tastss
great
but
the
highly
abv
makes
it
more
of
a
special
occasion
beer
750ml
bottle
pours
a
sunny
yellow
color
with
thick
head
very
nice
appearance
even
though
i
do
not
own
a
tulip
glass
duvel
smells
very
sweet
citrusy
and
nutty
on
the
taste
i
definitely
tastes
nuts
and
fruit
it
is
very
sweet
as
the
smell
indicates
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
i
would
say
and
it
goes
down
very
well
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
would
have
trouble
drinking
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
definitely
highly
praised
for
a
reason
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
one
or
two
bottles
the
high
alcohol
content
would
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
at
once
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
is
both
complex
and
well
balanced
love
the
fact
that
its
available
at
lcbos
all
around
here
and
will
definately
enjoy
another
soon
beers
like
this
always
serve
to
remind
me
that
the
world
of
craft
beer
does
not
begin
and
end
with
huge
ipas
and
massive
stouts
this
is
the
ultimate
belgian
strong
pale
and
one
not
to
be
missed
the
next
adventure
awaits
later
d
good
given
the
amount
of
alcohol
theres
a
reason
the
belgians
have
a
reputation
for
doing
strong
ales
better
than
anyone
else
light
yellow
fizzy
and
champagne
like
appearance
so
much
head
i
can
only
pour
so
much
into
my
chalice
at
a
time
sour
green
grapes
are
prevalent
in
the
smell
along
with
some
yeastiness
and
cloves
the
most
prevalent
taste
is
the
sour
green
grape
but
there
are
some
other
fruits
in
there
as
well
very
sweet
and
sticky
and
as
in
the
appearance
champagne
like
very
carbonated
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
but
not
very
heavy
at
all
extremely
drinkable
doesnt
taste
this
strong
at
all
poured
amber
hazy
hue
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
aroma
was
a
heavy
hop
light
yeast
and
alcohol
flavor
was
a
heavy
hop
light
yeast
with
a
moderate
alcohol
burn
with
a
long
duration
finish
this
is
a
standout
beer
notes
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
this
and
every
time
i
like
it
more
and
more
first
time
i
really
wasnt
that
impressed
but
now
im
hooked
d
could
drink
it
all
night
none
of
the
elements
are
overpowering
and
34
of
these
in
a
night
is
not
beyond
me
i
absolutely
love
it
certainly
a
well
brewed
beer
and
it
lends
to
my
ongoing
joke
about
why
the
germans
occupying
belgium
probably
got
fat
and
lazy
drinking
this
and
others
given
the
high
abv
not
a
beer
that
everyone
while
enjoy
but
a
neat
experience
nonetheless
stubby

then
coldconditioned
for

at

f
before
leaving
the
brewery
whew
this
brew
pours
a
bright
crystalclear
gold
with
lots
of
beads
of
carbonation
and
three
inches
of
beautiful
head
i
can
tease
the
foam
twofingers
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
it
is
as
dense
as
meringue
at
the
top
with
fluffy
froth
below
there
is
a
bit
of
haze
at
the
end
of
the
pour
and
a
huge
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
sweetish
with
subtle
esters
and
traces
of
noble
hops
its
a
bit
muted
at
first
but
as
it
warms
it
opens
up
and
becomes
more
aromatic
the
flavor
has
sweet
pilsner
malts
that
interplay
with
fruity
alcohol
and
esters
lots
of
warming
alcohol
flashes
of
spicy
saaz
and
notes
of
banana
and
spice
becomes
more
and
more
belgian
toward
the
end
with
lingering
hops
and
malt
mediumlight
on
the
palate
nearly
creamy
with
a
medium
finish
definitely
a
unique
brew
each
sip
begins
and
ends
like
a
pilsner
sandwiching
spicyfruity
belgian
notes
in
the
middle
making
me
want
to
call
it
a
belgian
imperial
pilsner
a
oneofakind
beer
that
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
definitely
worth
revisiting
drinkability
id
love
to
have
this
again
and
im
sure
i
will
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
very
balanced
and
fun
carbonation
provides
for
a
lot
of
excitement
in
both
look
and
feel
flavors
work
well
with
the
alcohol
too
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
poured
from
11
2oz
bottlebest
before
date
on

2011
into
chalice
pours
light
golden
almost
champagne
colored
with
tons
of
soapy
head
that
fills
the
glass
easily
with
a
careful
pour
the
sides
of
the
glass
are
covered
in
lacing
from
the
head
and
a
string
of
bubbles
rises
non
stop
around
the
glass
as
i
poured
it
i
was
strangely
reminded
of
busch
beer
in
the
scent
upon
letting
it
sit
i
get
more
banana
like
scents
taste
is
surprisingly
mellow
with
the
same
banana
flavor
as
i
got
in
the
smell
and
belgian
yeasts
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
watered
down
tripel
in
a
good
way
very
similar
in
flavor
to
many
of
the
tripels
ive
had
lately
but
much
smoother
and
more
balanced
ive
been
slowly
backing
away
from
belgian
styles
lately
but
this
one
makes
me
want
more
a
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
mouthfeel
is
a
little
tangy
on
the
tongue
and
dry
as
you
drink
it
but
makes
you
want
more
as
soon
as
you
set
the
glass
down
i
have
to
say
this
is
very
drinkable
for
being
8
5
abv
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
hasnt
had
it
poured
from
a
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
glass
pours
a
bright
and
clear
golden
yellow
the
last
glass
is
cloudy
with
yeast
sediment
every
pour
results
in
a
thick
soapy
white
head
that
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
smell
at
first
reminded
me
of
a
macrobrew
as
it
sat
odors
of
yeast
banana
and
alcohol
are
present
the
taste
is
sweet
with
strong
flavors
of
banana
and
yeast
with
little
hop
flavor
carbonation
is
strong
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
beer
m
thin
bodied
light
good
carbonation
the
color
is
brilliant
blond
with
a
great
good
body
theres
a
lot
of
spices
and
grapes
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
complex
and
very
strong
like
the
smell
with
spices
and
grapes
have
bittersweet
end
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
finished
very
fast
tasty
to
accompany
pastes
although
i
took
it
with
escalopes
d
easy
to
finish
and
worthy
of
the
reputation
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
would
be
a
treat
its
a
shame
this
beer
is
often
overlooked
by
me
because
of
harder
to
find
and
often
less
enjoyable
beers
ill
try
to
make
it
a
point
to
pick
this
up
more
often
this
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
especially
considering
the
abv
if
it
wasnt
printed
on
the
bottle
i
would
never
believe
this
to
be
an
8
5
again
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
refreshing
beer
drinkability
this
beer
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
tasted
4
5
d
this
is
some
tasty
shit
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
i
can
see
why
its
a
standard
time
to
get
a
sixer
and
branch
out
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
servicable
to
a
novice
like
myself
this
beer
was
both
clean
and
fresh
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
smell
of
the
beer
but
the
full
rich
taste
more
than
made
up
for
the
slight
offensiveness
caused
by
the
aroma
the
book
is
definitely
better
than
the
cover
here
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
this
beer
on
your
next
purchase
if
you
like
ales
or
goldens
or
belgians
of
any
kind
truly
a
beer
for
all
seasons
and
not
disappointing
in
the
least
my
only
regret
is
i
didnt
have
a
duvel
glass
to
try
it
in
that
will
be
my
next
task
note
i
drank
my
bottle
after
letting
it
warm
up
on
the
kitchen
counter
for
about
twenty
minutes
when
served
cold
the
flavor
is
crisper
and
the
carbonation
more
subdued
i
have
to
assume
allagash
white
is
a
tribute
to
this
beer
after
tasting
it
and
noticing
striking
similarities
both
are
delicious
a
lovely
pale
yellow
with
a
massive
fluffy
head
and
fine
active
bubbles
a
bit
of
orange
banana
and
earthy
spices
jumping
out
of
the
glass
its
a
pleasure
drinking
this
every
time
beautiful
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
present
and
slighlt
warming
but
in
no
way
dominates
such
a
good
beer
overall
surprisingly
good
for
the
storage
conditions
thank
you
belgium
can
i
become
a
citizen
d
almost
too
drinkable
given
the
abv
i
was
through
my
glass
in
no
time
and
ready
for
another
truly
a
classic
d
of
course
its
exceedingly
drinkable
this
is
for
me
the
quintessential
belgian
blonde
this
poured
a
delightful
golden
straw
color
almost
opaque
with
a
fantastic
foamy
white
mountainous
and
over
zealous
head
that
laced
perfectly
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
till
the
very
bottom
there
was
plenty
of
lively
carbonation
that
actually
put
me
in
a
daze
as
it
danced
to
the
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
was
well
balanced
and
appeasing
to
the
nose
citrus
wheat
malts
and
light
spices
were
all
evident
this
is
how
i
expect
a
true
belgian
to
smell
there
was
nothing
overpowering
just
welcoming
the
mouth
feel
was
beyond
exceptional
very
crisp
with
excellent
carbonation
initial
sweetness
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
yet
satisfying
finish
perfect
balance
of
flavors
that
tasted
much
like
the
nose
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
the
only
reason
i
give
it
a
4
is
because
of
the
alcohol
content
a
few
of
these
may
put
you
away
for
awhile
at
8
5abv
i
might
only
be
ale
to
do
half
a
sixer
of
it
depending
on
my
mood
overall
a
fantastic
brew
and
probably
on
my
list
for
top
3
belgians
it
certainly
lived
up
to
all
of
the
hype
d
an
amazing
beer
so
enjoyable
let
it
speak
for
itself
this
beer
is
what
so
many
others
try
and
fail
to
be
the
sophisticated
way
to
brew
an
intensely
flavorful
hoppy
beer
as
opposed
to
many
of
the
extreme
american
brews

love
the
appearnace
the
smell
and
tastes
backs
up
the
reputation
you
have
to
try
one
of
the
in
the
duvel
glass
to
fully
appreciate
it
take
you
time
prep
it
well
d
very
drinkable
for
a
decent
sized
beer
this
is
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
beer
styles
it
just
goes
down
so
easyily
and
is
nicely
drinkable
the
only
problem
is
i
could
see
the
abv
catching
up
with
you
because
it
feels
more
like
a
pilsner
rathe
than
a
belgian
just
very
light
and
enjoyable
sa
it
took
so
long
to
get
around
to
it
but
i
feel
like
i
finally
have
an
appreciation
for
a
beer
like
this
well
done
and
just
amazing
being
a
beer
advocate
for
this
long
and
ive
never
had
this
before
picked
up
a
4pack
of
this
which
came
with
a
duvel
glass
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
its
a
cloud
on
top
of
a
beer
lacing
stays
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
whole
beer
and
head
retention
is
outstanding
there
is
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
whole
time
smell
is
belgian
yeast
with
hints
of
sugar
candy
and
alcohol
sweet
crisp
taste
that
starts
off
sweet
with
sugar
and
evolves
into
a
more
bitter
taste
that
has
hints
of
seafood
almost
but
it
is
just
subtle
enough
to
be
enjoyable
and
not
disgusting
despite
the
appearance
the
beer
is
not
overly
carbonated
and
has
a
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
surprised
i
havent
had
it
yet
the
taste
is
very
clean
straightforward
pilsner
but
sweeter
and
more
complex
its
light
and
crispy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
interesting
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
very
interesting
brew
and
incredibly
drinkable
i
cant
believe
this
is

poured
into
chalice
i
dont

a
tulip
poured
a
bright
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
of
small
tight
bubbles
head
was
very
long
lasting
with
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
a
wonderful
spicy
aroma
that
can
be
picked
up
from
a
distance
the
flavor
follows
where
the
aroma
has
led
the
spice
is
the
most
noticeable
but
is
not
overpowering
the
secondary
flavor
is
the
unique
yeast
a
crisp
full
body
that
leaves
no
aftertaste
very
drinkable
having
several
of
these
will
make
for
a
great
evening
a
true
world
classic
drinkability
is
good
but
i
couldnt
do
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
d
very
easy
drinking
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
highly
recommended
to
all
lovers
of
beer
duvel
is
something
youve
just
got
to
try
at
least
once
chances
are
youll
be
coming
back
for
more
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
on
the
taste
buds
one
of
the
greatest
ever
produced
very
drinkable
easily
one
of
the
top
beers
in
the
world
overall
my
favorite
beer
its
one
of
those
things
that
hasnt
seem
to
got
old
yet
i
went
through
alot
to
get
my
favorite
beer
stop
to
order
it
its
one
of
those
rarities
you
cant
expect
to
find
around
here
d
extremely
drinkable
with
warning
that
you
dont
feel
the
abv
until
much
too
late
d
drinkable
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
over
carbonated
then
now
good
much
better
balanced
probably
got
a
bad
bottle
thats
why
i
was
hesitant
to
try
it
again
dwarming
eventually
comes
on
not
a
thinweakbodied
beer
just
smooth
not
a
pounder
not
a
meal
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
big
thick
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
left
nice
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
first
thing
that
the
aroma
brings
to
mind
is
yeast
that
gives
off
a
nice
fruit
aroma
banana
apples
and
slight
citrus
also
spicy
smells
waft
out
which
are
nice
mixed
with
the
hop
aroma
saaz
the
flavor
comes
across
as
sweet
at
first
from
the
malts
then
breaks
to
a
mix
of
fruit
apple
andor
pear
and
spicy
pepper
at
the
end
the
hop
aroma
identified
in
the
nose
comes
out
on
the
pallet
and
mixes
extremely
nicely
with
the
carbonation
levels
the
8
5
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
even
as
it
warms
i
am
not
really
picking
it
up
just
dynamic
flavors
that
play
together
so
well
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
clearly
the
best
belgium
strong
pale
i
have
had
though
i
have
not
had
many
i
will
admit
that
i
like
some
other
belgium
beer
types
more
this
one
bit
it
is
one
that
i
will
want
to
introduce
to
friends
as
it
a
very
very
good
ive
recently
been
drinking
grade
a
beers
and
this
is
my
favorite
it
is
so
tasty
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
it
has
a
world
class
taste
to
it
that
is
like
no
other
beer
that
ive
tried
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
has
8

abv
it
seems
less
so
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
everybody
should
try
it

quite

from

id
say
this
could
be
a
white

substitute
substantial
enough
to
complement
a
pizza
or
an
italian
sausage
or
could
very
well
be
paired
with
some
fish
or
grilled
chicken
swirling
the
bottle
and
adding
yeast
gives
it
a
whole
new
level
of
complexity
and
added
cloudiness
to
the

the

catch
up

if

i
find
this
a

much
like
a

less
like
an

my
taste
it
is
well

pale
golden
straw
with

a
few
bubbles
are

definitely
dedicated
to
their
task
of
joining
that
clouds
of
froth
forming
into
pads
where
a
tower
of
bubbles
does
its

to

dry
yeasty
notes
intermingle

my

sensors
taste
is
dryer
with
just
a
bare
hint
of
sweetness
laced
with
dry
champagne
the
yeastiness
noted
in
the
nose
is
subdued
in
part
due
to
the
carbonation
coming
alive
and
foaming
on
the
tongue
just
as
you
begin
being
able
to
taste
it
hops
finish
up
almost
resinously
bitter
but
in
balance
with
such
a
light
malt
profile
with
a
light
body
and
that
carbonation
that
sparks
to
a
rolling
boil
in
your
mouth
the
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
and
hides

it
probably
wouldnt

it
was
from

man
oh
man
was
i
wrong
duvel
has
got
it
going
on
beautiful
golden
color
and
a
massive
thick
chunky
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
and
remained
there
until
the
glass
went
in

smell
was

with
malts

the
flavor
was
very

full
of

a
golden
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
sustainable
head
liquid
gold
its
hard
to
classify
the
flavor
of
this
beer
as
it
is
so
unique
there
is
a
sweetness
of
honey
apples
and
cedar
this
beer
is
quite
hoppy
but
balanced
very
well
hops
and
malt
are
equally
strong
and
each
distinct
they
dont
blend
together
on
your
tongue
as
well
as
a
pale
ale
would
while
this
is
lighter
bodied
ale
it
is
certainly
not
a
weak
beer
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overwhelming
this
beer
gets
very
nice
as
it
warms
drinkabilitynotes
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
the
drinkability
is
high
but
watch
it
this
is
a
higher
end
alcohol
beverage
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
good
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
a
smooth
sipper
not
bad
at
all
d
overall
this
is
helluva
fine
beer
i
once
saw
a
belgian
guy
quaffing
this
beer
straight
from
the
330ml
bottle
at
lunch
time
when
i
visited
mechelen
belgium
while
i
was
sipping
elegantly
a
small
bottle
of
het
ankers
goulden
carolus
classic
in
a
goblet
he
drank
duvel
like
a
budstella
artoiscorona
and
he
consumed
two
bottles
of
them
in
20
minutesnow
i
could
imagine
why
but
still
disagree
with
the
way
the
beer
was
wasted
he
liked
it
anyhow
and
so
do
i
in
my
own
way
d
should
be
approachableenjoyable
by
all
not
a
session
brew
though
notes
an
old
favorite
both
sentimentally
and
tastewise
glad
i
finally
picked
up
a
bottle
for
review
i
forgot
just
how
good
and
unique
this
beer
is
and
i
now
remember
why
my
avatar
and
desktop
both
feature
duvel
pics
a
truly
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
a
great
change
of
pace
for
me
from
all
the
hop
bombs
and
stouts
ive
been
into
lately
i
love
this
beer
one
thing
i
will
say
though
is
that
ive
never
drank
this
beer
without
proper
glassware
and
i
dont
know
if
it
would
be
quite
the
same
without
it
a
well
crafted
beer
that
makes
me
happy
it
pours
with
a
bautahead
and
with
rings
of
lacing
like
sediments
marking
every
gulp
the
color
is
light
yellow
and
it
smells
of
yeast
and
citrus
the
yeast
is
coming
to
the
fore
in
the
taste
as
well
complimented
with
citrus
and
spices
it
ends
with
a
dry
bitter
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
unlike
many
other
beers
i
tasted
this
one
tasted
better
in
the
first
sips
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
the
nose
i
dont
know
where
to
start
its
almost
like
perfume
complex
sweet
but
also
a
strong
alcohol
smell
buttery
toast
in
the
background
with
a
nice
floral
fruity
bouquet
up
front
every
sip
gives
new
insight
into
the
world
of
better
beer
my
first
taste
and
first
review
but
i
will
revisit
this
brew
soon
this
is
definitely
one
for
reflection
jesum
crow
what
an
incredible
beer
the
body
is
med
to
high
very
easy
to
drink
with
low
phenol
flavors
overall
a
good
example
of
a
belgium
is
pretty
widely
distributed
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
its
a
real
trip
and
every
sip
packs
a
seductive
punch
i
will
have
a
six
pack
of
these
in
my
cellar
always
spicy
and
fruity
with
pear
flavors
and
white
pepper
very
clean
and
light
with
a
creamy
quality
on
the
palate
distinctive
belgian
yeast
taste
this
is
such
a
great
beer
with
complex
flavors
that
make
this
an
interesting
beer
this
beer
is
visually
fascinating
and
has
a
spectacularly
complicated
nose
and
flavor
but
im
just
not
sure
if
i
like
it
maybe
im
just
not
ready
or
maybe
im
not
in
the
proper
mood
this
beer
will
have
to
be
revisited
for
further
conclusions
to
be
drawn
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
especially
to
perkup
the
taste
buds
before
the
evening
meal
the
8
5
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
smooth
very
drinkable
ale
great
though
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
difference
in
price
that
it
often
manifests
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
tried
in
north
carolina
that
was
greater
than
6
5
alcohol
as
that
we
just
passed
out
pop
the
cap
bill
allowing
for
a
rush
of
new
often
wonderful
beers
d
this
beer
is
truly
light
and
it
does
have
some
nice
complexity
in
flavor
the
buttery
corn
notes
as
it
warmed
seem
to
interfere
with
the
other
flavors
but
not
a
great
deal
the
head
is
simply
incredible
and
the
lace
just
last
and
last
this
is
one
fizzy
yellow
beer
that
is
wonderful
drinkability
superb
drinkability
as
this
is
one
of
the
more
refreshing
belgian
beers
on
the
market
this
was
one
of
the
first
belgian
beers
i
had
many
years
ago
and
i
still
enjoy
it
to
this
day
drinkability
i
find
this
to
be
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
slugger
due
in
fact
to
the
strength
of
the
brew
and
the
delicate
nature
overall
more
of
a
treat
beer
for
me
pours
a
golden
yellowlight
amber
clear
with
ample
snowwhite
creamy
head
fed
by
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
my
chalice
nose
is
mustyyeasty
up
front
with
citrus
apricot
pineapple
and
a
slight
hint
of
alarming
vinegar
in
the
end
taste
starts
off
similarly
with
tropical
fruits
yeast
some
grainygrassy
notes
and
again
the
slightest
bit
of
puckering
vinegar
mouthfeel
is
typical
belgian
pale
light
dry
and
bubbly
this
was
a
tasty
bspa
but
ive
certainly
had
better
that
vingar
sourness
just
through
me
off
a
little
i
tend
to
like
my
bspas
a
little
sweeter
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
i
wanted
a
while
on
this
one
it
is
one
of
those
trappist
that
is
always
there
but
you
seemingly
passed
it
over
for
another
beer
needless
i
will
not
pass
this
one
over
highly
drinkable
alcohol
not
noticeable
at
all
drinkability
is
excellent
indeed
i
find
myself
agreeing
with
another
quip
found
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
enjoy
with
discerning
friends
or
good
looking
strangers
i
cant
really
add
anything
new
to
the
description
of
this
famous
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
my
take
on
it
is
that
the
appearance
is
awesome
mostly
due
to
the
clumpy
sticky
head
which
never
dissipates
the
taste
is
good
but
not
strong
i
think
i
prefer
more
robust
flavor
than
this
offers
but
the
drinkability
is
high
because
nothing
slows
you
down
goes
down
easy
the
duvel
is
definitely
in
the
details
upon
close
examination
one
can
see
a
steady
stream
of
tiny
bubble
spirits
rising
from
the
underworld
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
fireroasted
banana
with
a
pinch
of
satanchewed
bubble
gum
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
the
flavors
come
together
as
it
warms
in
the
demonic
inferno
enjoy
it
on
judgement
day
but
be
sure
to
pour
and
drink
slowly
so
not
to
open
up
the
firey
gates
of
hell
overall
a
great
beer
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
the
next
time
im
at
a
decent
lcbo
it
was
good
to
see
that
the
establishment
that
offered
this
belgian
used
the
duvel
snifterstyle
tulip
glass
the
head
was
among
the
most
impressive
i
have
seen
and
smelled
on
a
belgian
large
white
and
with
hints
of
sweet
fruits
citrus
bananas
yeasts
and
candy
sugar
the
taste
was
excellent
creamy
and
yeasty
finishing
dry
and
smooth
there
was
continuous
carbonation
but
enough
to
completely
distract
from
the
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
and
a
musttry
for
any
beer
drinker
drinkability
very
moreish
its
hard
not
to
have
quite
a
few
but
the
abv
tends
to
avoid
that
somewhat
cant
wait
to
compare
with
lf
du
monde
a
great
beer
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
excellentdangerously
so
at
8
5
abv
overall
a
good
solid
belgian
world
class
but
everyone
already
knew
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
exactly
to
my
taste
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
generally
prefer
to
taste
although
its
still
a
quality
bevo
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
a
different
time
but
right
now
i
would
rank
it
among
my
least
favorite
belgians
i
will
try
this
one
again
gladly
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
it
is
slightly
cloudy
the
head
is
thick
and
white
it
fades
slowly
leaving
lots
of
laces
the
aroma
is
a
little
hard
to
explain
this
beer
as
a
spicy
aroma
i
detect
pepper
cloves
and
a
slightly
malty
sweet
aroma
i
detect
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
this
beer
has
a
strong
spicy
flavor
it
has
a
sweet
malty
taste
also
it
is
slightly
hoppy
the
8
5
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
crisp
and
smooth
it
might
be
just
a
little
overcarbonated
but
not
so
much
that
it
detracts
form
the
flavor
this
beer
leaves
a
spicy
aftertaste
i
think
that
this
beer
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
with
an
abv
of
8
5
you
might
have
a
little
trouble
drinking
it
all
night
ultimately
i
think
this
beer
was
great
try
it
if
you
see
it
overall
you
must
try
this
beer
no
matter
what
your
preference
it
truly
is
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easy
for
such
a
high
abv
so
beware
had
this
beer
awhile
ago
and
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
given
the
hype
decided
to
give
it
another
go
and
get
pretty
much
the
same
results
it
is
one
of
the
most
visually
pleasing
beer
ive
ever
had
ill
give
it
that
big
mountainous
head
milky
white
piling
out
of
the
top
of
my
glass
smell
and
taste
are
sugary
sweet
with
traces
or
belgian
spices
and
spicy
herbal
hops
taste
is
nice
but
theres
a
strong
alcohol
kick
to
it
that
doesnt
seem
to
belong
in
this
beer
and
i
have
no
beef
in
general
with
a
little
alcohol
kick
and
maybe
a
little
overly
sweet
basically
im
pretty
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
maybe
if
id
had
lower
expectations
i
wouldve
liked
it
more
but
it
still
seems
like
an
average
belgian
ale
to
me
this
beer
must
be
served
in
its
appropriate
glass
tilt
glass
and
pour
slowly
a
thick
head
will
form
and
stick
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
is
slowly
consumed
duvel
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
spicy
scent
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
the
spiciness
almost
tickles
the
throat
duvel
is
an
enjoyable
beer
its
light
and
somewhat
hoppy
character
mask
the
bold
8
5
abv
a
trip
to
moortgat
brewery
is
impressive
and
educational
only
20
of
the
brewerys
production
is
exported
the
rest
stays
in
belgium
deceptively
strong
not
a
big
quaffer
but
id
like
to
give
it
a
burl
bottle
poured
into
a
recently
purchased
duvel
glass
the
appearance
is
a
dull
golden
with
a
neverending
cascade
of
tiny
bubbles
heading
towards
a
gigantic
white
frothy
head
the
head
will
lessen
but
stick
around
and
lace
the
glass
with
white
frothy
bubbles
the
smell
is
light
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
nice
smooth
crisp
and
carbonated
you
hardly
notice
the
alcohol
but
it
warms
the
body
head
still
existent
throughout
a
drinkable
beer
indeed
i
thought
id
like
this
beer
but
i
am
really
enjoying
it
it
really
suprises
me
how
good
this
is
i
only
wish
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
so
i
could
have
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
the
color
on
this
sample
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
and
cloudy
very
light
lightcrisp
fruity
taste
a
great
beer
to
sip
in
the
summer
shade
i
thought
the
smell
was
more
pronounced
than
the
taste
it
has
alot
of
champagne
character
you
just
cannot
taste
the
alchohol
in
this
one
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
one
is
not
enough
drinkability
is
ok
definite
alcohol
presence
which
makes
me
want
to
sip
this
more
than
anything
else
overall
this
beer
is
perfection
in
a
bottle
one
of
if
not
the
best
that
i
have
ever
tasted
if
youve
never
tried
it
do
so
immediately
the
taste
is
bright
and
crisp
with
barley
and
cider
flavors
tart
with
yeast
remnants
and
just
a
final
bit
of
dry
breadiness
theres
no
excess
of
sugar
in
the
body
which
makes
it
a
warming
filling
beer
without
the
young
sweet
affects
really
quite
excellent
this
beer
tasted
and
drank
so
well
crisp
clean
flavorful
and
direct
but
eluding
with
a
medium
body
the
8
5
alcohol
was
not
evident
or
overpowering
in
the
taste
the
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
of
these
its
insanely
drinkable
a
simply
great
beer
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
i
like
the
smell
really
well
but
when
tasting
throws
me
the
other
way
i
can
really
taste
the
increase
in
alcohol
in
it

highly
recommend
it
this
is
a

that
complements
all

of
cheeses
in
a
fantastic
way
great
stuff

it

so
good

the

there
is
an
exceptional

yes
i
will
buy
again
this
is
an
all
around
exceptional
example
of
the
style
and
surely
one
of
the
best
id
recommend
if
you
havent
had
many
trying
some
from
some
other
breweries
then
trying
duvel
to
see
what
you
think
either
way
its
a
great
beer
and
one
worthy
of
celebration
opinion
of
course
you
know
that
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
this
is
an
incredible
beer
it
is
light
and
very
well
balanced
the
mix
of
subtle
flavors
masks
the
bite
that
this
beer
packs
after
finishing
this
750ml
bottle
myself
i
am
feeling
a
bit
warmer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
a
truely
remarkable
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
head
that
just
would
not
stop
rising
white
and
puffy
smell
is
malty
and
candylike
with
all
the
pleasures
of
a
belgian
ale
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
spicy
notes
the
alcohol
aroma
is
there
but
not
as
strong
as
you
would
thing
it
carresses
the
tongue
as
only
this
style
of
beer
can
a
great
drinker
easy
to
forget
the
amount
of
alcohol
present
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
huge
white
head
fills
up
to
the
rim
of
my
big
duvel
tulip
lace
all
around
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
spicy
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
very
malty
slightly
sweet
spices
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
clean
bitter
finish
very
smooth
mouth
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
very
refreshing
excellent
and
timeless
beer
secondly
i
was
at
a
homebrewing
store
and
talking
to
a
frequent
belgian
traveler
who
said
belgians
and
duvel
dont
travel
well
it
was
a
much
better
beer
in
belgium
i
cant
imagine
that
it
is
so
good
here
light
and
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
substance
a
classic
that
deserves
the
credit
it
gets
very
tempting
brew
wonderful
cap
to
this
warm
sunny
day
as
night
and
mercury
fall
try
some
you
could
easily
pair
this
number
with
a
variety
of
foods
a
nice
veal
francese
wouldnt
hurt
but
mostly
behold
this
fine
selection
and
savor
each
and
every
naughty
moment
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
refreshingly
swillable
though
this
is
quite
far
from
swill
the
finish
manages
to
stay
quite
moist
with
a
small
otherwise
unnoticeable
alcohol
burn
coating
the
mouth
despite
the
high
proof
this
is
beer
is
damn
drinkable
i
drank
mine
in
several
gulps
though
im
sure
it
will
catch
up
with
me
shortly
den
this
beer
is
classic
in
every
sense
of
the
word
created
the
style
and
still
the
standard
bearer
there
is
nothing
like
a
bottle
of
duvel
its
reputation
is
completely
deserved
footnote
i
measured
the
duvel
glass
tulip
afterwards
and
the
volume
is
600ml
20
fl
ozs
even
with
my
bottle
being
330ml
the
massive
foam
head
easily
fills
the
space
i
dont
know
how
the
glass
was
designed
but
it
is
a
perfect
accessory
to
the
beer
drinkability
definitely
a
sipping
beer
drink
this
one
slowly
the
beer
is
basically
ideal
from
the
750ml
bottle
even
better
than
the
4
packs
what
can
i
say
this
is
the
ultimate
of
beers
poured
out
to
an
amazing
clear
and
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
white
cloud
like
foamy
head
dream
like
aroma
of
sweet
spice
and
crisp
herbs
the
taste
is
heavenly
with
the
carbonation
demanding
attention
from
your
tastebuds
to
savor
every
drop
of
this
brew
flavors
of
citrus
sweetness
and
bitterness
were
most
noted
but
this
beer
is
almost
beyond
words
finished
crisp
and
clean
like
it
was
daring
me
to
not
take
the
glass
from
my
lips
the
ulitimate
beer
in
my
opinion
well
worth
the
price
tag
of
the
big
bottle
highly
recommended
this
is
the
end
all
be
all
of
world
class
beers
in
my
opinion
the
only
brew
that
has
every
earned
all
5s
in
my
reviews
this
is
beer
from
heaven
grace
be
to
god
this
brew
is
the
ultimate
ive
reviewed
nearly
300
beers
but
somehow
id
not
gotten
duvel
despite
it
being
a
favorite
i
drink
2
or
3
times
a
month
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
light
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
substantial
punch
a
classic
and
a
style
unto
itself
without
equal
drinkability
is
the
same
as
taste
and
mouthfeel
marked
down
for
the
fizz
liberated
from
its
corked
750
ml
bottle
that
i
am
sharing
with
an
uberdiscerning
good
friend
as
per
the
instructions
on
the
bottle
a
gargantuan
head
immediately
crops
up
and
threatens
to
get
out
of
control
rocky
pure
white
head
plumes
above
the
glass
and
taunts
me
as
i
sip
sticky
pactches
of
foamy
lace
are
left
behind
floral
aroma
greets
my
eager
nostrils
and
fills
them
fresh
cut
apples
herbs
bitter
lemons
some
grass
and
a
little
brash
alcohol
taste
begins
deceptively
mellow
one
sly
devil
of
a
brew
smooth
bready
malts
take
the
lead
before
being
outshined
by
strong
spices
and
some
herbs
yeast
is
noticeable
and
transitions
into
clovey
bananas
before
giving
up
to
warming
alcohol
finish
is
bitter
lemons
with
some
alcohol
and
a
slightly
drying
acidity
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
compliments
the
complex
flavor
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
all
around
its
nice
that
such
a
great
beer
is
so
readily
available
too
nothing
short
of
excellent
this
beer
is
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
big
thick
white
head
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
it
smells
citrusy
and
spicey
and
a
little
yeasty
too
it
has
a
very
clean
crisp
fruity
flavor
with
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
fact
that
it
is
8
5
is
not
obvious
when
tasting
it
im
sure
it
becomes
obvious
after
a
second
or
third
glass
one
of
the
classics
after
the
rave
reviews
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
for
a
pale
ale
i
suppose
it
was
decently
complex
but
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
more
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
duvel
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
beers
character
and
seamless
integration
of
flavors
makes
it
the
defining
example
of
the
style
imo
quite
drinkable
i
will
buy
many
more
her
taste
is
very
fruity
flavours
of
apple
banana
and
fruits
were
present
clear
fresh
hops
and
some
roasted
malt
were
shy
but
there
a
very
smooth
beer
than
doesnt
show
his
alcohol
content
well
drinkable
nice
and
enjoyable
duvel
as
most
everyone
on
this
site
knows
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
around
at
8
5
alc
it
can
really
pack
a
punch
but
try
serving
it
instead
of
wine
it
does
come
in
a
750ml
bottle
at
your
next
dinner
party
and
you
may
just
be
surprised
at
the
reaction
you
get
it
has
a
wonderful
smell
that
reminds
me
of
a
field
in
the
summertime
a
rich
golden
color
and
a
creamy
thick
head
light
mouthfeel
this
would
make
a
lovely
apertif
at
the
end
of
a
good
meal
belgians
they
are
masters
taste
crisp
malt
taste
with
lots
of
alcohol
and
a
little
bit
of
an
apple
and
other
fruit
flavors
in
there
theres
some
pepper
and
spice
that
comes
through
with
the
big
alcohol
but
overall
its
a
pretty
easier
drinker
for
its
heft
theres
a
real
nice
zing
of
carbonation
in
the
mouhtfeel
and
it
ends
crisp
sweet
and
delicious
highly
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
but
the
abv
s
probably
a
little
high
for
pounding
was
a
little
over
carbonated
but
not
too
much
very
good
beer
over
all
definitely
one
to
drink
cold
on
a
hot
summers
day

berfore
10
2007
on
bottle
purchased
at
greens
in
atlanta
ga
served
at
home
in
a
duvel
glass
how
appropriate
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
dubbed
it
headache
in
a
bottle
with
the
phenolics
and
alcohol
that
name
probably
is
appropriate
but
it
is
after
all
a
well
crafted
ale
most
impressive
lacing
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
besides
that
its
extremely
light
colored
and
clear
which
makes
me
want
to
chug
it
if
i
wouldnt
gag
on
the
foam
smell
is
medicinal
with
lots
of
yeasty
goodness
taste
is
very
spicy
dry
and
alcoholic
with
more
of
that
great
yeast
flavor
the
yeast
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
stands
out
as
very
smooth
and
silky
this
is
one
i
will
pick
up
more
often
330
ml
brown
stubby
bottle
with
best
before
date
stamped
on
the
rear
label
well
well
well
i
thought
i
perhaps
built
this
beer
up
too
much
in
my
mind
but
now
i
just
think
the
bottle
is
too
damn
small
the
taste
is
super
light
and
crisp
not
an
extremely
bold
flavor
but
it
tastes
great
spices
and
pilsner
malts
with
an
ever
so
modest
hop
character
to
round
out
the
whole
affair
this
is
like
a
heavyweight
abv
light
beer
very
strange
and
wonderful
you
could
guzzle
these
down
and
be
caught
totally
unaware
by
the
alcohol
which
remains
completely
undetectable
in
taste
or
smell
very
excellent
choice
for
warmer
weather
when
a
refreshing
and
high
powered
beverage
is
called
for
this
sucker
is
a
very
good
beer
it
deserves
the
adoration
that
so
many
seem
to
have
for
it
surprising
and
impressive
a
pleasure
each
time
i
have
it
truly
a
great
beer
golden
straw
body
very
clear
lots
of
bubbles
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
with
an
brilliant
white
huge
head
which
never
goes
away
aroma
is
sweet
a
little
fruity
and
very
spicy
this
tastes
great
very
sweet
and
citrusy
upfront
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
thicker
than
expected
from
appearances
after
a
few
sips
and
as
it
warms
spices
start
to
come
through
this
is
an
immensely
drinkable
beer
which
is
a
dangerous
combination
with
its
alchohol
content
one
of
the
great
beers
bottle
looks
fantastic
pale
yellow
almost
like
champagne
with
a
reasonable
creamy
head
that
retains
well
and
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
subtle
sweet
spicy
with
hints
of
honey
taste
is
very
well
balanced
starting
sweet
and
finishing
slightly
bitter
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
hardly
noticable
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
these
if
only
i
could
afford
to
the
ridiculous
prices
you
need
to
pay
over
here
drinkability
heres
a
good
way
to
get
loaded
fast
with
quality
beer
good
beer
id
say
nothing
to
go
nuts
over
though
despite
the
high
abv
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
a
soft
silky
mouthfeel
and
everpresent
fizz
make
for
an
absurdly
drinkable
brew
despite
the
8
5
came
in
a
33cl
short
stubby
brown
bottle
with
freshness
date
092007
at
first
it
looks
harmless
but
its
alcohol
content
8
5
makes
you
have
to
respect
it
aswell
as
watch
how
much
you
consume
of
it
quite
an
exceptional
beer
overall
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
found
very
well
rounded
beautiful
golden
colored
body
and
its
rich
complexity
makes
this
a
top
notch
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
all
easy
to
drink
and
accessable
but
not
world
class
in
my
mind
either
i
have
more
to
learn
or
others
are
too
easily
impressed
drinkability
this
is
one
you
could
drink
all
night
but
at
8
5
youd
best
be
careful
of
the
beer
goggles
that
the
devil
will
subvert
your
vision
with
youll
probably
wake
up
next
to
another
type
of
devil
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
brilliant
clear
gold
with
a
thick
dense
white
head
te
head
retained
well
and
when
it
did
recede
it
left
a
chunky
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
a
stream
of
champagne
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
a
testament
to
the
carbonation
of
the
bottle
conditioned
beer
i
detect
characters
form
the
yeast
in
the
nose
a
doughy
hint
followed
by
apples
pears
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
pepper
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
spiciness
up
front
followed
quickly
by
more
of
the
applepear
character
and
topped
by
grapefruit
and
orange
bright
slightly
slick
mouth
feel
and
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
impressions
this
is
a
thing
of
beauty
in
all
aspects
next
time
you
see
it
pick
up
the
four
pack
with
the
tulip
glass
it
makes
for
an
amazing
presentation
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
drinkability
all
day
a
bit
potent
but
very
drinkable
at
last
finishing
an
unending
banter
with
another
employee
the
waitressbarmaid
returned
taking
the
bottle
and
glass
and
asked
for
five
dollars
without
a
please
or
thankyou
also
i
use
my
duvel
tulip
religiously
for
a
variety
of
beers
i
got
this
750ml
on
sale
for
5
99
and
it
was
a
joy
to
employ
the
tulip
for
its
intended
brew
still
dont
have
that
tulip
but
i
decided
to
rereview
this
one
im
glad
i
did
my
palate
has
apparently
grown
up
since
i
first
reviewed
duvel
and
i
now
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
i
still
wish
i
had
a
tulip
but
i
dont
think
it
matters
and
it
certainly
didnt
affect
the
taste
of
the
beer
nor
the
drinkability
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
liking
and
the
smell
is
a
touch
weak
but
other
than
that
this
is
one
good
brew
when
i
poured
this
i
thought
i
did
a
terrible
job
and
maybe
i
did
but
the
picture
on
the
bottle
shows
a
lot
of
head
there
as
well
so
i
guess
thats
normal
as
for
the
beer
itself
it
was
about
as
smooth
as
anything
8
that
ive
had
tastes
a
lot
like
maredsous
another
one
i
liked
the
beer
just
kind
of
floated
its
way
down
into
my
stomach
i
finished
it
without
even
noticing
my
progress
i
think
that
says
something
about
a
beer
oh
yeah
and
i
wasnt
drunk
either
so
it
must
have
been
the
duvel
i
was
expecting
great
things
with
this
beer
but
i
didnt
quite
receive
them
it
is
just
a
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
outstanding
very
well
ballanced
i
might
add
too
i
enjoyed
it
but
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
watch
the
alcohol
content
it
will
sneek
up
on
you
i
feel
as
comfortable
sipping
this
beer
by
day
as
i
do
by
night
the
most
beautiful
foamy
head
ive
ever
seen
and
it
lasts
forever
in
the
duvel
glass
sitting
atop
a
gold
so
intense
it
almost
glows
fragrant
fruity
spiciness
sweet
yet
crisp
and
clean
notes
ii
holy
bejesus
the
devil
is
kickin
my
ass
here
the
appearance
is
cloudy
with
an
obviously
thick
head
this
is
not
a
beer
you
need
to
pour
aggressively
to
get
an
acceptable
head
the
smell
is
great
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
im
not
sure
what
it
is
about
this
beer
that
is
different
be
it
the
bohemian
hops
or
the
belgian
yeast
either
way
the
flavor
is
great
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
incredible
fruit
flavor
very
good
beer
this
is
the
classic
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
have
to
use
a
tulip
glass
to
get
the
full
effect
of
the
pour
slightly
hazy
pale
yellowgold
color
with
massive
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
just
kept
coming
full
chunky
white
head
nice
lace
trail
no
strong
smells
light
citrus
some
coriander
typical
lager
smells
flavour
is
also
quite
light
more
tangy
citrus
and
some
spice
touch
of
weiss
yeast
finish
nice
finish
of
balancing
hops
smooth
finish
its
not
until
the
beer
hits
your
stomach
that
you
feel
the
warmth
from
the
high
alcohol
content
perfect
for
a
cold
day
mouthfeel
light
body
dry
a
little
astringent
and
sour
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
this
tart
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
this
is
a
beer
you
really
want
your
sences
at
their
peek
for
a
fantastic
belgian
in
every
way
drinkability
not
a
bad
session
brew
if
you
can
tolerate
the
8
5
abv
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
was
all
hype
i
couldnt
have
been
more
wrong
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
am
beginning
to
love
belgian
strong
pale
ales
it
pours
a
cloudy
lemon
yellow
color
and
has
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
in
my
glass
it
has
a
fruity
yeasty
aroma
and
a
very
yeasty
fruity
flavor
very
well
balanced
and
definitely
world
if
only
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
i
could
go
broke
drinking
this
bier
now
given
the
8
5
abv
this
should
have
some
alcohol
kick
i
tasted
none
of
it
i
felt
it
around
the
11th
ounce
this
beer
is
scarily
easy
to
drink
i
will
not
consume
this
if
i
have
to
drive
because
i
dont
think
i
could
limit
myself
to
one
or
two
what
a
mouthfeel
lively
and
smooth
exactly
how
it
should
be
tastes
good
not
too
many
specifics
that
i
can
pinpoint
but
generally
floral
mild
orange
hops
and
some
light
esthers
damn
i
love
this
glass
just
beautiful
all
the
way
through
amazing
lacing
and
the
head
is
determined
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
brew
with
a
unique
taste
that
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
of
it
at
first
but
the
taste
grew
on
me
i
would
say
it
improved
as
the
beer
grew
warmer
a
classic
also
as
a
side
tip
make
sure
that
you
get
some
of
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
in
your
glass
it
really
does
enhance
the
flavor
wonderfully
in
this
one
i
really
feel
bad
saying
this
but
this
beer
kinda
sucked
the
flavor
of
it
was
pretty
disgusting
tasted
almost
like
a
bad
witbier
something
about
this
just
turned
me
off
completely
im
highly
dissapointed
given
that
this
is
such
a
classic
beer
well
cheers
anways
delicious
belgian
pale
quickly
becoming
a
preferred
style
the
drinkability
is
great
for
this
type
of
beer
some
of
the
sweetness
will
limit
this
from
being
any
type
of
session
beer
oelergud
i
have
awoken
late
at
night
from
a
terrible
nightmare
in
the
past
i
dreamt
that
duvel
could
no
longer
be
imported
to
the
us
wow
what
an
awful
dream
just
plain
awful
this
beer
is
almost
indescribable
it
seduces
you
with
fruity
and
spicy
aromas
and
flavors
yet
every
drink
begs
another
until
the
4
pack
that
you
bought
is
gone
and
of
course
youre
incapacitated
on
the
floor
from
the
8
5
abv
think
of
a
heavy
bodied
beer
how
it
tastesfeels
then
somehow
make
it
as
easy
to
drink
as
iced
tea
amazing
but
be
careful
your
wallet
and
your
liver
do
pay
the
price
drank
this
after
sharing
some
kwak
at
a
christmas
party
what
a
difference
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
big
puff
of
pure
white
head
enticing
aromas
of
fresh
bread
yeasty
must
cloves
banana
and
cotton
candy
oohh
baby
this
is
good
doughy
malts
yeast
clove
and
pepper
banana
yellow
raisens
and
rock
candy
sweet
without
tasting
sugary
quite
complex
and
warming
alcohol
not
obvious
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
tight
bubbly
mouthfeel
very
well
done
it
makes
the
kwak
look
like
an
amature
offering
more
please
the
devilhuh
well
come
on
in
this
belgian
poured
a
bright
clear
gold
with
a
wonderfully
foamy
head
that
left
heavy
lacing
all
the
way
downthe
champagne
like
carbonation
was
a
definite
plus
this
looked
just
beautiful
sitting
there
in
my
goblet
both
aroma
and
flavor
were
subtley
citrucy
and
spicy
with
slight
hints
of
clove
and
banana
overall
full
bodied
and
extremely
smooth
this
one
is
definitely
a
keeper
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
i
should
have
no
problem
finishing
off
this
bottle
drinkability
if
i
let
this
one
sit
for
an
hour
before
drinking
it
would
have
been
better
the
carbonation
is
about
the
only
drawback
in
this
beer
for
me
otherwise
it
would
be
one
of
my
top
10
probably
very
tasty
i
must
recommend
that
you
have
the
proper
glassware
for
this
one
otherwise
you
are
in
for
a
difficult
pour
pours
a
clear
golden
into
the
duvel
glass
with
half
the
glass
being
a
fluffy
pillowy
meringuelike
head
that
gets
thicker
with
time
and
laces
like
nobodys
business
smells
slightly
sour
and
clovey
taste
was
a
spicey
light
malt
with
a
long
dry
finish
very
complex
sometimes
varying
with
the
bottle
mouthfeel
was
rather
smooth
and
dry
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
good
and
easy
to
find
beer
and
quite
an
experience
visually
i
must
find
a
duvel
glass
for
home
use
sin
in
a
glass
anything
this
good
must
be
sinful
and
will
send
you
straight
to
hell
and
i
dont
care
sending
me
to
hell
is
worth
it
for
this
magnificent
brew
poured
into
a
large
sniffter
this
beer
appears
to
be
clear
its
a
golden
honey
clear
colour
but
no
thats
an
optical
illusion
it
appears
clear
but
its
actually
quite
cloudy
i
couldnt
see
through
the
glass
like
i
thought
i
could
large
puffy

that
ever
so
slowly
settles

how
can
this
look
any
better
simply
put
it

delicate

sweet
and
pale

an
almost

just
as
good
as
it
smells
starts
out
with
a
bready
maltiness
mingled
with
a
pepper
and
spice
taste
that
tingles
the
tongue
middle
is
very
fruity
dry
apples
pears
and
just
a
touch
of
sourness
citrus
maybe
leaves
with
a
spicy
bitterness
with
still
a
bit
of
sweet
and
juicy
fruit
damn
what
a

smooth
thick
and
creamy
excellent

can
be
savoured

the
first
good
beers
i
tried
and
one
i
still
often
come
back
to
one
of
the
pioneers
of
classic
beers
of
belgium
is
duvel
and
for
me
one
of
the
best
too
what
a
wonderfull
and
everlasting
foam
great
colour
and
that
together
with
a
wonderfull
nose
make
this
beer
great
without
even
tasting
it
nose
is
most
hops
malt
and
hardly
any
yeastsmell
nice
and
clean
taste
wich
is
mostly
malt
with
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
of
fine
hops
one
that
i
go
for
and
i
would
recomend
to
relax
and
just
enjoy
the
great
taste
that
beer
can
have
beautiful
nearperfect
aroma
of
muscadine
grapes
pears
belgian
yeast
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
little
understated
like
a
typical
belgian
blonde
the
palate
is
dominated
by
yeast
a
touch
of
light
malt
and
a
fleeting
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
foamy
still
very
drinkable
a
wonderful
belgian
ale
this
brew
poured
a
huge
head
that
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
the
head
is
left
behind
quite
distinctly
on
my
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
taste
is
heaven
on
earth
a
seamless
blend
of
malts
hops
and
an
unnoticeable
high
abv
creates
one
spectacular
beer
it
is
very
lively
on
the
palate
and
very
fulfilling
for
a
golden
ale
despite
the
high
abv
one
can
sip
this
thing
of
perfection
all
night
long
talk
about
your
value
beers
this
is
one
of
the
most
complete
beers
i
have
had
for
an
outstanding
price
an
amazing
brew
my
first
all
5s
i
have
had
this
over
the
years
and
it
ranged
from
eh
to
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
all
around
i
wish
i
could
find
it
more
often
truely
a
classic
if
not
for
the
8
5
abv
this
would
be
awesome
for
extended
sessions
great
great
beer
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
and
pleasant
which
lends
to
a
very
good
drinkability
on
this
yummy
belgian
this
is
the
quintessential
belgian
beer
yes
its
way
too
commercial
and
too
popular
but
really
theres
a
reason
for
that
it
embodies
all
the
characteristics
of
yum
city
the
pour
into
its
own
tulip
is
a
golden
body
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
even
with
a
slow
unhurried
pour
i
love
making
it
froth
and
almost
escape
from
the
glass
huge
thick
feathery
down
lacing
along
the
glass
scent
is
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
well
just
spice
and
sweetness
wafting
forth
taste
is
a
bomb
of
spiciness
and
bitternessa
dn
finishing
off
slightly
bitter
with
a
warm
sweetness
and
ending
with
the
hops
i
have
to
mark
down
mouthfeel
only
because
the
bubbles
are
occasionally
intrusive
they
fill
the
mouth
and
you
really
have
to
fight
them
to
taste
the
beer
and
then
its
over
and
you
have
the
nicest
hops
and
spice
coating
your
tongue
i
really
could
drink
this
all
night
bring
a
couple
of
four
packs
or
a
few
750s
and
youve
got
the
perfect
night
still
not
amazing
but
much
much
better
than
drinking
it
out
of
a
normal
chalice
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
stings
the
front
of
your
tongue
right
away
and
the
body
is
more
medium
than
it
looked
this
even
left
a
pretty
pleasant
aftertaste
i
had
2
bottles
due
to
how
drinkable
it
was
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
the
finish
has
an
alcohol
kick
and
then
a
prolonged
intriguing
green
apple
tartness
mingled
with
hoppy
bitterness
and
belgian
yeast
this
beer
is
close
to
perfect
everyone
should
try
it
pours
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
with
a
very
substantial
white
head
which
slowly
subsides
into
lots
of
clingy
lacing
aromatic
and
appetizing
with
plenty
of
hop
flower
smell
backed
by
alcoholic
spice
and
yeasty
notes
mellow
subtle
and
rounded
flavors
the
floral
and
hop
bitterness
are
intertwined
and
constantly
vying
for
your
attention
very
well
balanced
with
neither
flavor
overpowering
the
other
a
great
dry
finish
which
leaves
you
wanting
more
lovely
creamy
yet
carbonated
body
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
8
5
abv
drinkability
insanely
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
light
crisp
but
also
quite
complex
and
flavorful
really
hard
to
beat
notes
this
is
a
quite
enjoyable
brew
that
i
could
drink
every
night
i
love
the
hops
the
bitterness
is
just
wonderful
extra
note
strikes
me
as
being
very
versatile
in
combination
with
a
wide
variety

beering
watch
out
this
beer
is
contagious
one
will
not
cut
it
buy
4
or

a
crisp
refreshing
brew
the
alcohol
kind
of
sneaks
up
on
you
the
8
5
isnt
real
noticed
until
you
about
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
awesome
stuff
this
must
be
what
set
the
standard
for
this
genre
its
got
it
all
not
a
good
session
brew
but
perfect
for
a
special
occasion
i
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
every
week
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
there
is
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
here
seems
a
little
too
fizzy
going
down
otherwise
it
is
very
smooth
drinkability
is
good
as
well
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
many
things
that
draw
me
to
this
beer
is
that
the
novice
and
the
expert
can
with
some
patience
enjoy
it
few
beers
offer
such
calm
complexity
the
aroma
is
distinct
an
alcohol
tinged
banana
coconut
smell
hard
to
pinpoint
though
the
taste
is
faintly
alcoholic
and
yeasty
it
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
distinct
and
unique
beer
that
has
few
equals
trying
this
beer
again
after
about
5
years
back
then
me
and
a
friend
drank
it
out
of
a
bottle
and
complained
this
time
around
i
poured
into
the
closest
glassware
i
could
find
to
the
one
pictured
and
it
came
out
a
nice
hazy
lager
colour
with
a
pure
white
head
that
refused
to
go
away
this
time
around
i
can
certainly
appreciate
the
taste
a
lot
more
it
is
definitely
a
yeasty
beer
which
can
scare
a
lot
of
people
off
the
taste
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
in
this
range
of
alcohol
strength
how
the
hell
do
those
belgians
manage
to
hide
that
alcohol
taste
it
continues
to
amaze
me
some
people
seem
to
think
that
the
taste
is
too
powerful
and
the
85
should
say
dont
drink
more
than
one
but
i
totally
disagree
i
can
sit
and
sip
at
these
little
suckers
all
evening
and
all
night
long
the
perfect
belgian
ale
and
it
beats
any
other
beer
in
this
family
nice
meringuelike
head
floating
on
top
of
clear
yellow
beer
very
clear
no
yeast
tastes
great
your
standard
belgian
nothing
special
but
nothing
lacking
nice
and
creamy
yet
not
too
filling
very
nice
this
is
a
great
session
beer
if
you
can
afford
it
id
like
to
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
this
came
in
a
corked
750ml
bottle
after
finally
wrestling
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
i
poured
this
into
a
snifter
where
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
formed
that
peaked
over
the
glass
the
body
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
gradually
collapses
into
a
rocky
cavernous
landscape
with
chunks
of
lace
strewn
about
the
glass
the
second
fill
of
the
glass
the
body
was
much
murkier
the
aroma
had
hints
of
apple
with
a
spice
and
yeast
notes
present
as
well
the
spice
was
the
main
contributor
to
the
smell
as
this
warmed
to
room
temp
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
is
the
first
thing
you
taste
before
the
spice
comes
in
and
sticks
around
though
the
finish
this
has
a
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
that
has
a
strong
bready
and
yeasty
presence
mouthfeel
on
this
is
medium
to
full
with
a
very
filling
quality
about
it
even
when
you
take
a
small
sip
drinkability
is
perfect
i
could
drink
this
all
day
or
until
i
hit
the
floor
as
the
8
5
does
not
show
at
all
great
beer
that
everyone
should
give
a
try
if
they
havent
already
a
very
strong
beer
not
intended
for
session
drinking
but
a
good
choice
for
a
belgian
ale
nonetheless

a
ubiquitous
classic
the
fact
that
duvel
is
so
readily
available
may
cause
one
to
hold
it
in
contempt
resist
this
temptation
a
remarkably
elegant
beer
that
compares
quite
well
to
champagne
i
suspect
that
the
experience
is
greatly
enhanced
by
the
use
of
proper

this
is
a

yeast
alcohol
spiciness
hops
and
butter
flavors
mouthfeel
is
full
and
well
carbonated
so
much
closer
to
being
the
champagne
of
beers
than
the
macro
label
that
carries
the
phrase
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
actual
duvel
glass
truly
brings
out
all
of
the
fantastic
features
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
the
head
on
this
beer
is
as
good
as
it
comes
very
thick
and
fluffy
throughout
the
entire
glass
it
never
got
less
than
a
quarter
inch
thick
as
far
as
the
aroma
goes
this
is
where
the
tulip
shaped
glass
shined
all
of
the
floral
fruitness
is
concentrated
to
the
exact
spot
that
your
nose
hits
as
you
take
a
sip
yeasty
explosions
fill
the
nostrils
and
remind
you
that
you
are
enjoying
one
of
belgiums
finest
taste
this
beer
has
all
the
pieces
to
make
this
a
true
classic
the
super
sweet
malt
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
and
comes
together
ultra
smooth
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
this
beer
is
truly
spectacular
and
i
am
now
an
advocate
on
proper
glassware
enjoy
this
one
luxurious
ultrafoamy
aspirin
white
head
forms
quickly
remaining
until
the
first
sip
after
which
it
slowly
puts
on
a
magnificent
churning
foaming
show
until
it
reaches
a
good
3
or
4
centimetres
upon
my
word
the
head
is
like
a
living
thing
untouched
it
remains
like
styrofoam
sometimes
it
appears
so
thick
it
looks
like
ice
cream
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
lacing
is
the
thickest
i
have
ever
seen
the
liquid
is
almost
rosewine
coloured
slightly
pink
and
occasionally
almost
white
light
light
orange
and
very
pale
with
only
fleeting
golden
glimpses
whilst
at
first
it
appears
to
be
transparent
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
clearly
not
but
quite
thick
and
murky
aroma
immediately
is
sugary
aged
peaches
or
nectarines
along
with
a
bakingbread
yeast
smell
a
definite
aged
smell
to
this
bottle
musky
dusty
and
very
mature
the
sweetness
borders
on
sourness
and
some
honey
aromas
become
clear
candy
apples
pears
apricots
sugarrich
candy
light
but
very
bready
malt
ripe
green
apples
soap
characteristics
not
as
spicy
as
it
is
sweet
taste
delivers
on
the
aroma
fully
what
struck
me
immediately
was
how
incredibly
drinkable
this
was
for
a
strong
belgian
the
taste
is
a
superbly
balanced
experience
i
was
expecting
cloying
sweetness
with
some
fruity
yeast
but
it
has
so
much
more
the
hops
undetectable
in
the
aroma
complement
the
sweetness
expertly
dusty
full
yeast
taste
on
the
middle
giving
green
apples
again
strongly
along
with
other
fruits
perhaps
pear
toasted
malt
with
strong
caramel
and
semisourness
almost
akin
to
tomato
juice
if
tasted
strongly
enough
very
full
yet
it
disappears
in
effervescence
on
the
tongue
in
a
slight
tingle
and
foaminess
when
exhaling
with
the
beer
in
the
mouth
i
get
strong
dough
or
pasta
tastes
some
fresh
pine
wood
tastes
the
aftertaste
for
me
personally
was
all
green
apples
and
sugary
pear
yes
the
phenols
are
there
but
at
first
i
did
not
even
notice
the
alcoholit
was
that
smooth
and
balanced
certainly
it
does
not
suggest
8
5
this
bottle
seemed
to
be
very
foamy
but
not
overly
gaseous
in
the
mouth
the
lees
tasted
separately
give
super
fresh
apple
and
fresh
dough
smells
dust
and
ultrasweetness
the
lees
give
the
beer
even
more
of
a
white
appearance
almost
like
a
witbier
smooth
in
the
mouth
very
full
it
tasted
basically
as
though
i
had
poured
some
dry
yeast
into
a
glass
full
of
lukewarm
water
and
consumed
it
the
yeast
made
the
beer
warmer
personal
verdict
one
of
the
best
this
is
classic
beer
and
when
aged
it
accrues
even
greater
proportions
like
a
classic
novel
written
a
hundred
years
ago
this
is
something
most
people
will
revisit
again
and
again
with
friends
on
memorable
occasions
this
beer
is
one
of
the
few
i
have
found
that
have
an
indescribable
quality
about
them
it
is
not
easy
to
put
into
words
why
this
is
such
heavenly
liquid
still
a
fine
beer
for
all
occasions
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
fun
to
use
this
in
a
bait
and
switch
on
a
bud
drinker
ha
every
time
i
have
this
beer
i
feel
differently
about
it
so
my
review
may
change
often
there
have
been
times
where
i
would
have
given
it
a
perfect
score
and
times
that
i
am
disappointed
by
a
harsh
bite
anyways
definitely
leave
the
lees
in
the
bottle
for
this
one
a
good
session
beer
except
for
the
8
5
abv
wonderful
belgian
ale
a
devil
of
a
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
light
straw
color
with
a
gigantic
meringuelike
head
the
nose
is
very
lemony
the
beer
is
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
lemon
undertone
that
finishes
with
just
a
slight
hop
kick
on
my
tongue
very
refreshing
for
this
moderately
warm
summer
day
the
beer
is
moderately
thick
in
my
mouth
without
an
overowering
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
true
session
beer
for
me
is
the
abv
d
drinkabilityoverall
so
light
and
crisp
that
you
forget
about
the
high
abv
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
a
devil
of
a
treat
from
the
stubbie
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
liquid
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
so
far
this
is
one
great
looking
brew
some
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
head
shrinks
but
never
fully
disappears
swirling
the
glass
brings
another
rise
to
the
head
smells
slightly
yeasty
with
some
spice
to
it
almost
peppery
pale
malt
flavor
with
some
tartness
slight
fruit
notes
to
go
with
a
slight
spicey
flavor
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
noticable
at
the
end
high
carbonation
makes
this
have
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
what
a
classic
nothing
is
overpowering
this
has
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
but
you
might
not
notice
it
until
it
is
too
late
damn
you
devil
welcome
to
the
dark
side
one
of
my
favourite
commerciallyavailable
beers
of
all
time
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
golden
color
and
is
a
bit
hazy
with
the
inthebottle
fermentation
yeast
has
an
excellent
foamy
head
that
remains
the
entire
time
you
are
drinking
it
you
can
eat
the
head
with
a
fork
the
smell
is
exquisite
with
spicy
and
fruity
tones
and
a
bit
of
malt
the
taste
is
wonderful
i
enjoy
belgian
ales
and
this
one
is
excellent
for
a
bottled
beer
commercially
available
in
the
usa
it
is
a
strong
crisp
spicy
ale
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
that
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
i
highly
recommend
this
for
anyone
anytime
but
especially
one
who
is
trying
out
the
belgian
style
excellent
ale
drinkability
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
because
duvel
is
fairly
heavy
and
strong
in
alcohol
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
beer
to
the
belgian
style
as
it
is
complex
and
not
as
overpowering
on
the
palate
as
the
chimay
tripel
and
dark
as
for
drinkability
id
say
this
is
a
beer
to
try
once
in
a
while
its
good
but
its
hard
to
knock
back
more
than
one
of
these
8
5
alcohol
havin
beers
notes
this
beer
has
a
nice
warming
quality
because
of
its
great
flavors
and
its
balanced
taste
this
one
will
stay
in
my
good
graces
drinkability
going
through
a
full
750ml
of
duvel
would
not
be
a
problem
due
to
its
exceptional
attenuation
and
clean
finish
but
i
know
better
this
devil
is
one
to
make
deals
with
in
moderation
wow
this
beer
has
the
biggest
head
ever
pours
a
very
pale
lager
yellow
with
a
foamy
monster
that
looks
like
marshmellows
expanding
the
lacing
is
clumpy
mounds
smell
is
rather
clean
to
the
nose
slight
yeast
smell
fruit
notes
bring
up
the
rear
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
yeast
i
detect
light
malts
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
very
refreshing
a
light
bodied
ale
very
drinkable
and
that
is
scary
with
this
monster
being
8
5
some
great
fruity
characters
burst
on
the
tongue
no
sweetness
just
fruit
followed
by
bitter
finish
that
lingers
great
drinkability
complex
and
well
rounded
drinkability
very
tasty
but
you
feel
the
alcohol
quickly
so
having
more
than
750
ml
maybe
a
bit
of
a
push
drinks
fantastic
the
smell
is
really
cool
you
smell
slight
esters
and
hops
but
mostly
spices
of
many
sorts
and
each
taste
and
smell
vary
from
instance
to
instance
this
beer
is
complex
goodness
and
i
would
love
it
on
any
special
occasion
very
drinkable
for
one
so
strong
i
will
buy
this
again
seriously
guys
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
and
this
is
what
ale
was
meant
to
be
large
bottle
with
cork
and
cage
pours
very
light
wheat
cloudy
head
is
the
stuff
of
beer
dreams
lacing
is
world
class
intricatefluffy
voluminious
great
retention
finally
dissolving
to
the
tiniest
of
tiny
bubble
sheens
nose
of
yeast
pepper
powdered
sugar
alcohol
citrus
and
a
light
fruityness
taste
is
of
limes
gin
tart
peppery
bitterness
late
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
world
class
belgian
its
a
blessing
to
us
all
that
this
nectar
of
the
gods
is
widely
available
go
get
some
now
chill
pour
and
enjoy
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
as
an
end
note
once
the
beer
warms
a
bit
a
peppery
alcohol
taste
steps
in
front
of
the
warm
bready
flavors
in
my
opinion
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
cooler
side
of
the
temperature
scale
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
it
pours
with
an
enormous
white
head
the
head
is
head
itself
is
absolutely
amazing
stable
and
rocky
with
large
pockets
between
the
bubbles
it
reminds
me
of
glass
insulating
foam
the
kind
used
on
chemical
piping
lace
is
phenomical
the
aroma
is
flowery
a
mix
of
hops
and
esters
its
got
a
peppery
tinge
to
the
smell
as
well
the
beer
itself
is
crystal
clear
and
effervescent
my
glass
has
a
scoring
at
the
bottom
and
the
steady
stream
of
bubbles
that
rises
from
it
looks
vaguely
like
a
flame
on
a
roaring
fire
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
followed
by
an
intense
hoppiness
i
remember
the
surprise
that
i
experienced
when
i
first
tasted
this
beer
its
so
intensely
flavorful
in
some
beers
the
aroma
is
the
dominant
attribute
but
with
duvel
the
mouthtaste
is
essential
its
full
and
almost
chewy
i
get
a
yeasty
taste
throughout
the
beer
as
well
this
beer
is
simply
marvelous
i
bought
a
gift
set
that
included
the
duvel
glass
and
let
me
say
this
beer
looks
dead
sexy
sitting
in
its
own
glass
golden
in
color
with
a
bit
of
roange
and
a
giant
white
clumpy
head
with
tiny
bubbles
surging
towards
the
top
in
a
column
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
it
smells
like
freshly
cut
grass
and
pears
and
though
it
doesnt
really
make
sense
it
smells
like
its
color
it
tatses
like
id
think
grass
would
with
a
touch
of
peper
the
carbonationa
nd
alcohol
burn
on
the
outside
edge
of
the
tounge
a
bit
and
the
aftertaste
is
lemony
with
other
cirtus
characteristics
the
head
lingers
for
a
long
time
it
is
thin
in
the
mouth
but
the
carbonation
really
gives
it
a
fuller
feal
while
you
can
taste
hints
of
the
8
5
abv
it
adds
to
teh
beer
and
overall
youwouldnt
think
the
abv
was
that
high
making
it
quite
drinkable
i
probably
drink
this
beer
slower
then
most
a
definate
sippin
beer
because
the
flavor
burst
on
your
tounge
with
each
small
sip
and
as
it
warms
the
pearcirtus
flavor
comes
out
more
and
the
slight
peppery
flavor
disapears
i
think
pepper
might
be
the
wrong
word
but
i
cant
think
of
how
else
to
describe
that
flavor
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
5
alcohol
this
is
becoming
quite
available
in
this
area
so
i
think
ill
be
picking
some
up
as
the
occasional
nightcap
overall
this
is
one
amazing
beer
and
it
deserves
all
the
credit
it
receives
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
with
its
deceptive
8
5
alcohol
content
this
beer
looks
beautiful
when
poured
the
taste
is
even
better
allinall
a
worldclass
beer
from
start
to
finish
highly
recommended

finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
after
all
these
years
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
slighty
hazy
yet
very
light
looking
a
nice
white
head
floats
on
top
aroma
of
yeasty
malts
and
spices
greet
the
nose
hairs
nothing
overpowering
yet
inviting
taste
is
fairly
clean
for
a
belgian
starts
off
very
clean
and
carbonated
then
the
flavors
kick
in
slight
tropical
fruitiness
along
with
a
slight
bready
malt
all
flavors
are
subtle
here
a
nice
fine
carbonation
holds
this
together
slight
hoppy
finish
to
keep
things
dry
quite
drinkable
but
not
quite
spectacular
just
a
good
belgian
triple
and
perhaps
a
benchmark
very
dry
and
subdued
i
poured
this
into
a
rapscallion
glass
which
produced
an
enormous
white
head
it
looked
like
the
merienge
on
a
lemon
mereinge
pie
the
color
was
a
cloudy
yellow
and
the
head
left
a
kind
of
chunky
lace
on
the
glass
it
has
a
strong
fruityand
spicey
aroma
reminded
me
of
apples
and
pepper
the
strong
alcohol
8
5
and
the
hops
bitterness
hits
you
all
at
once
and
settles
into
a
crisp
finish
i
would
have
liked
to
get
more
flavor
characteristics
from
this
beer
after
smelling
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
looks
like
a
mountain
range
after
30
seconds
great
lacing
as
well
noticed
aromas
of
stong
floral
hops
fruits
yeast
and
spices
great
smelling
beer
whatever
is
in
there
its
just
smells
too
good
to
drink
taste
however
is
better
nice
hoppy
bite
that
smooths
out
into
a
nice
finish
so
many
flavors
going
on
here
its
great
to
taste
carbonation
is
big
on
this
one
and
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
great
brew
i
love
it
i
understand
now
why
there
are
so
many
proponents
of
this
beer
a
fine
one
indeed
i
will
try
it
again
belgian
golden
ale
pours
cloudy
golden
with
a
lusciously
thick
white
foamy
head
that
has
very
nice
retention
good
amount
of
carbination
but
not
overwhelming
great
spicey
bite
in
the
aroma
and
taste
very
peppery
and
wonderful
good
creamy
body
that
is
not
too
thick
in
your
mouth
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
cream
sherry
comes
to
mind
wonderful
ale
great
drinkability
pleasant
pretty
much
sums
it
up
and
while
not
amazing
pleasant
works
real
well
the
individual
pieces
are
light
in
nature
but
they
combine
to
flesh
out
a
lively
identity
the
abv
is
real
and
present
maybe
the
most
substantial
of
the
separate
elements
and
you
have
to
regard
it
but
the
full
flavor
and
effervescence
make
it
nicely
drinkable
so
even
if
it
doesnt
floor
me
id
never
feel
cheated
while
im
drinking
one
a
beer
welldeserving
of
a
very
good
reputation
poured
from
a
14
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
duvel
glass
a
truly
exceptional
appearance
nice
gold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
which
lasts
a
while
when
it
does
go
down
it
maintains
a
pretty
thick
lace
the
smell
and
taste
are
intertwined
you
can
just
smell
the
spicy
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
the
taste
definitely
has
those
it
reminds
me
of
grand
crus
i
have
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
honestly
that
is
a
hard
category
for
me
to
rank
the
esters
while
they
make
for
a
very
good
taste
it
reduces
its
drinkability
for
me
a
truly
great
beer
duvel
poured
a
nice
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
an
incredible
amount
of
staying
power
when
it
finally
diminished
it
left
a
nice
lacing
all
the
way
around
the
smell
was
a
nice
spicy
aroma
with
hints
of
citris
the
taste
was
fairly
sweet
with
citris
flavors
on
the
front
end
and
a
little
bit
of
a
peppery
kick
to
it
on
the
tail
end
the
carbonation
made
the
mouthfeel
failry
light
and
gave
it
an
almost
champagnelike
quality
to
it
overall
the
drinkabilty
is
remarkably
high
as
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
of
course
that
can
be
quite
dangerous
due
to
the
alcohol
content
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
and
i
recommend
it
to
any
and
everyone
poured
from
a
brown
750
ml
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
color
that
was
a
little
cloudy
after
a
careful
pour
per
instructions
on
the
label
head
was
composed
of
small
bubbles
in
a
large
white
setting
it
then
settled
down
and
left
a
sticky
sugary
cottoncandy
look
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
was
very
clean
fresh
and
floral
the
flavor
was
very
nicely
balanced
among
all
elements
no
flavors
jumped
out
at
me
it
wasnt
too
sweet
too
hoppy
too
anything
but
it
was
good
lots
of
floral
butter
herbal
notes
with
a
slight
tart
edge
loved
it
alcohol
was
a
little
sneaky
a
huge
foamy
head
on
a
glittering
golden
color
nice
smell
of
yeast
grain
wheat
alcohol
too
the
taste
is
a
smooth
yeast
citrus
and
banana
flavor
at
first
very
similar
to
a
hefe
weizen
quickly
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
give
you
a
strong
kick
and
the
taste
becomes
way
more
aggressive
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
long
lasting
floral
hoppy
aftertaste
i
like
how
this
beer
combines
two
very
different
feelings
and
tastes
and
how
the
change
in
taste
is
very
sudden
and
kind
of
unexpected
after
a
while
the
two
distinct
aspects
mix
together
to
form
this
beers
unique
character
very
nice
duvel
may
very
well
be
an
acquired
taste
it
reminded
me
to
be
honest
of
a
beer
that
had
been
crossed
with
cognac
or
brandy
p
s
i
finally
bought
the
glass
pack
to
enjoy
duvel
in
a
tulip
and
it
made
quite
a
difference
the
carbonation
was
good
before
but
now
there
are
a
ton
of
bubbles
constantly
streaming
up
from
the
d
etched
on
the
bottom
of
this
glass
if
you
ever
are
looking
to
buy
a
tulip
style
glass
this
is
the
best
way
to
get
two
of
them
for
a
great
price
and
see
a
demonstration
of
the
magic
they
do
on
a
beer
very
good
beer
though
a
330
ml
bottle
served
in
one
of
the
duvel
tulips
included
within
the
gift
pack
poured
up
to
three
fingers
of
light
sculptable
foam
there
was
good
retention
and
ample
belgian
lace
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
alcohol
and
strong
spicy
scents
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
and
earthy
with
grain
spicy
and
hints
of
the
strong
alcohol
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
extremely
light
and
drinkable
id
still
grab
a
fin
before
this
but
i
have
a
newfound
respect
for
this
belgian
golden
and
look
forward
to
drinking
the
other
three
bottles
in
my
fridge
what
a
head
this
thing
looked
like
a
junior
high
science
class
volcano
project
the
head
was
a
good
inch
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
with
no
spillage
the
initial
taste
had
some
bite
to
it
you
know
this
beer
has
some
serious
etoh
i
liked
the
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
it
had
a
bit
of
a
rubbing
alcohol
aroma
to
it
though
overall
i
liked
this
beer
just
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it
this
beer
looked
very
good
going
into
the
glass
it
had
a
great
white
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
very
noticable
this
was
the
first
time
i
have
ever
experienced
a
belgian
strong
ale
i
guess
i
just
dont
care
for
the
sour
aftertase
which
i
believe
is
typical
of
the
style
i
am
sure
it
is
a
great
beer
its
class
it
is
just
not
for
me
overall
a
very
good
beer
if
you
enjoy
la
fin
du
monde
rare
vos
and
others
try
the
ale
that
inspired
em
all
purchased
a
few
33
cl
bottles
of
this
for
a
bargain
i
brought
them
home
and
whipped
out
the
duvel
tulip
glasses
which
are
the
only
way
to
drink
this
beer
this
guy
pours
out
a
beautiful
pale
golden
color
and
has
the
most
incredible
fluffy
white
head
billow
atop
of
the
beer
theres
instructions
on
how
to
pour
it
so
that
it
does
that
too
just
in
case
the
smell
is
of
active
little
hop
some
citrus
small
fermented
esters
the
taste
is
wonderful
can
something
be
rich
and
light
it
glides
easy
with
clean
feel
again
light
citrus
and
hop
prescence
with
a
very
clean
malt
to
give
structure
interesting
spice
notes
play
with
the
body
of
the
beer
no
way
youd
know
about
its
high
abv
this
is
the
best
looking
beer
on
the
planet
and
among
the
best
tasting
theyre
not
just
being
cocky
when
the
last
of
the
pouring
instructions
tells
you
enjoy
perfection
enjoy
a
hazy
pale
golden
ale
with
a
large
white
head
and
vigorous
carbonation
this
smells
great
with
a
peppery
maltiness
and
some
spiciness
underlaying
it
the
aroma
is
evident
as
soon
as
the
bottle
is
opened
the
taste
is
a
clean
malty
ale
with
almost
no
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
are
spices
present
that
i
have
a
hard
identifying
but
this
is
a
powerful
elixir
it
has
a
clean
bubbly
feel
in
the
mouth
and
then
the
alcohol
hits
it
is
excellent
from
the
first
drop
to
the
last
it
gets
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
the
only
drawback
is
my
inability
to
drink
more
than
one
due
to
the
alcohol
content
but
ill
be
back
tomorrow
it
is
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
the
aroma
has
some
delicate
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
it
is
smooth
and
light
the
finish
is
a
spicy
crisp
dryness
it
is
refreshing
and
wonderful
and
it
goes
down
so
easily
despite
its
high
alcohol
let
me
preface
this
by
saying
this
is
my
favorite
beer
it
pours
to
a
crisp
golden
hue
which
is
protected
by
a
massive
white
head
champagne
like
bubbles
rapidly
race
to
the
surface
of
this
beer
aroma
is
of
spice
but
with
some
notes
of
yeast
the
taste
is
clean
and
yeasty
but
balanced
well
with
some
spicey
aftertaste
i
thought
the
750
ml
bottle
had
less
hoppiness
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
33
cl
bottles
the
same
duvel
character
remained
though
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
as
this
beer
goes
down
creamy
and
bubbly
drinkability
is
also
amazing
considering
the
massive
alcohol
content
of
this
brew
i
wish
i
could
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
and
still
feel
fine
the
next
morning
this
beer
is
a
true
masterpiece
in
my
mind
very
interesting
beer
this
one
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
really
nice
frothy
white
head
that
left
little
specks
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
quite
unique
with
a
slightly
bitter
apple
scent
and
a
grainyness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
was
quite
dry
like
champagne
but
with
better
flavor
the
apple
scent
came
out
slightly
in
the
flavor
but
i
mostly
detected
a
peppery
spice
which
was
very
nicely
paired
with
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
definanlty
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
of
the
time
but
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
many
meals
and
would
convert
some
wine
and
champagne
lovers
to
beer
as
well
duvel
pours
with
a
giant
head
that
takes
a
long
long
time
to
diminish
almost
whipped

the
beer
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
nose
is
full
of
hops
and
spice
taste
is
very

with
some
finishing

making
this
one
of
the
most
aptly
named
brews
around
deceptively
smooth
and
drinkable
this
beer
can
unleash
a
stealth
attack
on
your
sobriety
lest
you
take
care
with
your
pace
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
it
had
a
hoppy
and
malty
sweet
continental
aroma
fluffy
white
head
and
hazy
golden
liquid
the
taste
is
amazing
soft
malt
and
bready
yeast
notes
with
a
nice
crisp
hoppiness
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
strong
beer
that
you
could
easily
mistake
for
a
beer
of
a
more
moderate
alcohol
content
be
careful
sampled
from
a
250ml
bottle
this
legendary
beer
pours
a
very
pale
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
highly
carbonated
champagne
like
tawny
white
head
what
a
perfect
pour
with
one
of
the
most
amazing
head
retentions
i
have
seen
will
have
to
credit
this
with
the
priming
of
the
candied
sugar
brilliantly
spiced
aroma
along
with
a
thicket
of
musty
maltiness
and
a
decent
amount
of
hopping
the
mixture
of
malty
sweetness
bready
yeast
notes
and
striking
bitterness
equates
to
one
of
the
most
amazing
beers
in
the
world
the
mouthfeel
is
a
complex
combination
of
fizzy
carbonation
and
syrupy
sweetness
if
and
when
they
begin
to
keg
this
stuff
it
is
going
to
be
the
true
end
of
the
world
so
drinkable
just
imagine
what
it
will
be
like
on
tap
pours
a
golden
color
with
large
white
head
do
not
make
my
mistake
and
uncarefully
pour
it
into
a
regular
glass
it
will
foam
all
over
the
place
pour
it
into
the
predescribed
bowlshaped
glass
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
very
complex
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
is
slithgly
dry
but
sweet
at
the
same
time
i
cant
explain
it
well
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
the
taste
is
one
of
a
kind
with
a
bit
of
spicyness
about
it
i
love
the
taste
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
because
it
seems
like
a
very
full
bodied
beer
to
me
sorta
fills
me
up
ive
had
this
in
belgium
in
the
smaller
bottle
and
i
definitely
thought
the
750
ml
to
be
drier
and
woodier
very
impressive
and
wonderful
brew
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
one
asap

live
in

yet
undeniably
edible
simple
elegant
but
complex
plus
one
of
the
best
glass
designs
it
started
a
revolution
in
belgian
brew
styling
and
continues
to
be
a
true
classic
the
scion
of
its
own
style
pat
truly
a
classic
beer
that
is
often
immitated
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
be
said
after
191
reviews
but
what
the
hell
why
not
great
golden
color
with
a
stormlike
swirl
of
carbonation
from
first
sip
to
last
thick
rocky
head
more
or
less
sits
atop
the
beer
like
a
fluffy
pillow
very
floral
spicy
aroma
fruity
in
the
sense
that
many
fruits
melons
oranges
etc
have
a
bitter
rind
and
a
sweet
inside
this
beer
is
more
or
less
the
same
bitter
and
sweet
very
very
tasty
and
definitely
not
as
hard
to
drink
as
the
abv
might
suggest
if
i
had
could
only
have
one
beer
in
my
fridge
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
would
be
this
one
its
that
good
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thick
soapy
and
bubbly
head
very
active
the
head
will
maintain
throughout
and
thin
sugary
lacing
will
dominate
the
interior
of
the
glass
very
well
formed
initial
aroma
is
huge
spices
hops
even
some
vanilla
cloves
and
fresh
bread
is
noticed
the
aroma
seems
to
change
somewhat
throughout
the
duration
but
is
always
quite
pleasant
an
initial
combined
taste
of
fresh
fruity
sugary
bubble
gum
spicy
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
an
immediate
belly
warmer
feeling
going
on
the
alcohol
is
noticed
throughout
but
does
not
seem
to
be
overpowering
very
creamy
and
delicious
throughout
crisp
malty
and
fizzy
finish
leaves
you
begging
for
more
a
sipping
beer
take
note
though
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
the
duvel
feeling
will
last
for
quite
some
time
for
8
50
a
4
pack
a
little
over
2
smacks
for
a
duvel
a
near
steal
this
is
an
awesome
brew
a
definite
musttry
amazing
hazy
light
golden
color
almost
yellow
exceptional
frothy
white
head
nice
rings
of
lace
aroma
seems
similar
to
almost
every
other
belgian
or
belgian
style
ive
tried
ditto
on
the
taste
i
cant
identify
it
but
its
a
spicy
hoppiness
i
know
its
also
the
yeast
espescially
with
duvel
as
i
have
heard
they
dont
use
spices
spritzy
mouthfeel
almost
champagne
like
a
drink
i
dont
care
for
8
on
or
abouts
but
pretty
drinkable
for
such
strength
ive
tried
to
get
in
to
the
genre
but
its
not
easy
for
me
my
apologies
to
lovers
of
belgian
ales
but
i
can
take
or
leave
them
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aromas
are
medicinal
and
fruity
the
flavor
is
somewhat
fruity
apples
maybe
a
sweet
herbal
flavor
also
comes
through
this
smooth
mediumfull
brew
is
easy
drinking
finishing
with
a
dryness
that
sticks
with
you
it
has
a
strength
that
will
easily
sneak
up
on
you
a
real
struggle
to
finish
the
bottle
note
on
22032005
i
decided
to
drop
drinkability
to
2
5
and
taste
to
4
0
because
im
sort
of
tired
of
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
it
should
be
in
my
top
five
not
sure
if
its
just
me
or
if
the
beer
has
changed
hay
not
a
bad
beer
the
yeast
might
turn
some
people
off
duvel
has
a
somewhat
cloudy
amber
color
a
thick
head
that
lasts
forever
the
taste
is
a
real
mouthfull
maltyfruityspicydryand
smooth
the
avb
of
8
5
could
make
it
a
bit
much
for
consumption
of
mass
quantities
must
taste
side
by
side
with
hennepin
someday
they
are
both
champoins
strong
pale
ales
a
very
good
beer
but
there
are
many
other
belgians
that
i
feel
are
much
better
seems
a
bit
overrated
to
me
pours
out
very
pale
with
way
too
much
head
and
froth
all
over
the
place
when
i
uncorked
the
undisturbed
bottle
quite
sweet
with
the
whole
belgium
citrusgrainspicy
thing
going
for
it
there
are
many
better
brews
from
belgium
that
i
enjoy
more
so
i
plan
to
stay
away
from
this
pricey
monster
of
a
beer
but
my
advise
to
bas
is
to
try
it
as
most
floks
seem
to
like
it
a
strong
belgian
golden
ale
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
one
the
color
just
shines
thru
the
light
and
it
is
very
drinkable
a
true
gem
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
balance
the
foamy
pour
lets
the
beer
breath
and
this
beer
truly
is
the
devil
as
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
until
you
stand
up
afer
a
few
if
there
is
one
beer
tour
to
take
in
belgium
or
anywhere
it
is
the
moortgat
brewery
tour
where
duvel
and
maredsous
are
brewed
and
enjoyed
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
tasty
fresh
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
overpower
the
beer
but
theres
little
complexity
in
the
flavors
to
support
it
i
prefer
orval
and
chimay
and
la
trappe
come
to
think
of
it
the
aroma
is
complex
overwhelming
spice
fruit
oppressive
maltiness
the
taste
then
expands
intense
fruit
esters
banana
pear
citric
sourness
ruthlessly
at
first
a
rude
invading
stampede
but
then
following
with
a
finish
that
lingers
long
as
it
dissolves
into
exotic
florid
memories
the
dénouement
is
sophisticated
an
ethereal
stretch
it
is
the
proper
occasion
for
a
taste
of
cheese
a
nut
or
a
bit
of
fruity
juxtaposition
it
is
also
the
time
for
intense
thoughts
and
for
deep
rustling
feelings
for
a
belgian
ale
duvel
is
one
of
my
all
time
favoritesnot
as
sweet
as
most
and
slightly
hoppier
its
also
so
amazingly
elegant
and
well
balanced
even
not
being
a
big
fan
of
this
style
its
hard
to
find
faults
with
duvel
the
cork
flew
right
out
of
my
hand
with
a
literally
deafening
pop
sound
my
right
ear
is
still
ringing
and
i
think
the
neighbors
called
the
police
this
amazing
beer
pours
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
loves
to
hang
out
and
tease
you
i
smell
a
very
pleasant
fruitiness
mostly
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
from
the
high
carbonation
but
its
a
most
enjoyable
carbonation
to
simply
state
the
complexity
of
taste
sweet
fruity
spicymostly
on
the
finish
simply
amazing
this
beer
defines
what
high
drinkability
is
8
5
abv
you
would
never
have
a
clue
of
that
high
level
without
the
label
on
the
bottle
stating
it
not
to
sound
repetitive
but
this
beer
can
definitely
be
dangerous
im
going
to
struggle
to
limit
myself
to
one
750ml
bottle
so
good
its
painful
this
is
a
beer
you
dont
ever
want
to
stop
drinking
one
of
the
best
qualities
of
this
is
the
sound
it
makes
when
you
pop
the
cap
the
whooshing
sound
of
the
air
escaping
lasts
twice
as
long
as
most
beers
and
if
you
put
your
hand
near
it
you
can
feel
that
its
twice
as
powerful
it
takes
much
longer
than
most
beers
to
pour
also
because
the
head
was
so
large
i
once
tried
to
take
a
sip
of
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
was
punished
with
a
head
that
rushed
out
and
foam
went
everywhere
i
learned
my
lesson
a
beer
of
this
quality
requires
respect
as
for
the
taste
a
strong
yeast
flavor
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
a
wonderful
flavor
of
ripe
fruit
follows
apricot
apple
peach
its
all
there
its
got
a
slightly
alcoholic
finish
which
doesnt
bother
me
in
the
least
it
just
serves
as
a
reminder
of
the
strength
of
this
brew
the
apperance
could
have
been
a
little
darker
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
thicker
but
other
than
that
its
pretty
close
to
perfection
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
you
need
to
right
now
hazy
golden
lemon
color
and
a
formidable
head
even
after
a
gentle
pour
with
the
consistency
and
color
of
stiff
egg
whites
persistent
carbonation
adds
to
the
attraction
of
this
pretty
pour
smell
is
very
pleasant
though
a
tad
weaker
than
one
might
expect
given
the
action
of
this
beer
clean
malty
grains
and
yeast
with
some
spice
on
the
edges
a
really
wonderful
interesting
taste
the
easiest
aspect
of
the
taste
to
pick
out
is
the
yeasty
bready
finish
sweet
grains
start
it
out
giving
way
to
noticeable
carbonation
and
an
astringent
warmth
and
finally
the
aforementioned
finish
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
pleasantthe
flavors
linger
without
coating
the
mouth
given
the
strength
of
this
ale
it
has
an
ominously
drinkable
character
first
thing
you
notice
is
that
if
foams
alot
you
need
to
pour
this
up
easily
the
color
is
golden
with
a
misty
touch
from
yeast
sediments
imho
the
smell
is
nothing
special
it
tastes
great
though
its
bready
taste
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
with
a
citrus
tone
if
you
are
sensitive
you
might
taste
a
little
alcohol
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
mammoth
and
lasting
head
very
minimal
lacing
sweet
bready
aroma
very
tingly
on
the
tongue
and
the
flavor
was
not
overly
complex
i
tasted
citrus
lemon
mainly
vanilla
a
little
alcohol
and
some
yeast
very
smooth
finish
makes
this
beer
quite
drinkable
very
good
belgian
while
i
dont
buy
into
the
belgian
ideal
that
every
beer
deserves
its
own
glass
theres
something
satisfying
about
pouring
duvel
into
its
glass
and
letting
the
head
almost
overflow
taking
up
half
the
glass
its
a
beautiful
glass
of
beer
my
favorite
beer
hence
the
nickname
a
much
copied
style
and
copied
very
well
by
many
this
stands
out
even
amongst
the
great
competition
there
is
just
a
little
something
extratangy
in
the
taste
that
i
havent
experienced
even
after
trying
many
of
the
greatest
belgian
ales
my
favorite
style
the
appearance
and
taste
are
legendary
huge
lemon
meringue
looking
head
fruity
spicy
taste
unbelievable
drinkability
for
such
a
potent
beer
im
sure
these
strong
ales
arent
for
everybody
but
every
beer
lover
should
give
this
a
try
as
for
you
belgian
beer
fans
try
it
head
to
head
against
the
competition
somehow
the
duvel
is
totally
unique
enjoy
phoosh
off
goes
the
cap
with
a
blast
pouring
it
slowly
was
not
enough
to
tame
this
wild
head
the
head
literally
grows
before
your
eyes
forming
a
peak
of
meringue
so
thick
you
can
float
a
half
dollar
on
it
the
beer
itself
is
highly
carbonated
it
actually
formed
whirlpools
of
spiral
bubbles
in
my
glass
the
color
is
crystal
clear
straw
golden
aroma
is
typical
weihenstephan
weizen
yeast
with
that
bananaclove
tang
pretty
typical
in
the
aroma
department
the
taste
is
also
pretty
typical
bavarian
wheat
but
with
a
warming
punch
of
alcohol
no
lambic
aroma
or
taste
has
a
sweetness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
for
the
finish
and
not
much
for
hop
flavor
fumes
of
alcohol
warm
the
nostrils
after
a
hearty
gulp
aside
from
the
wonderful
head
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
earns
such
stellar
reviews
it
may
be
a
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ale
but
it
tastes
like
a
typical
bavarian
wheat
and
not
even
a
good
one
at
that
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
like
a
doppleweizen
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
just
one
bottle
and
would
not
buy
another
in
the
future
amazing
mountainous
head
and
a
wonderfully
integrated
peppercitrusalcohol
aroma
it
has
a
good
citrus
alcohol
flavor
with
a
creamy
mediumlight
body
slight
pleasant
after
taste
reminds
you
of
how
good
the
last
drink
was
and
invites
you
back
for
another
drink
and
before
you
know
it
the
whole
1
5
liter
bottle
is
gone
this
beer
is
too
quaffable
not
a
bad
thing
slight
pleasant
after
taste
and
rewarding
pours
a
clear
straw
color
until
the
last
drops
of
the
yeast
fall
into
suspention
then
the
beer
turns
a
hazy
which
is
quite
pleasing
the
citrus
fruit
fills
the
nose
with
hop
overtones
that
are
lovely
i
wonder
if
they
use
candi
sugar
like
homebrewers
do
to
get
the
high
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
is
not
over
powering
for
being
8
5
abv
i
now
see
why
this
beer
is
number
3
on
top
ten
list
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
for
my
new
years
stash
and
it
was
a
pretty
good
choice
because
it
actually
reminded
me
of
champagne
in
some
ways
the
beer
is
golden
with
the
thickest
head
ive
ever
dealt
with
there
were
icebergs
of
foam
the
lacing
was
thick
and
pervasive
the
beer
had
a
cloudy
mucky
appearence
as
well
with
lines
of
bubbles
dragging
up
the
sides
the
smell
is
of
fruits
and
alcohol
in
my
book
even
here
i
notice
some
champagnelike
characteristics
the
taste
again
was
fruity
with
currant
and
alcohol
kicks
involved
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
beer
brings
to
mind
the
word
effervescent
overall
a
good
beer
the
duvel
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
fine
belgian
brewery
the
hoppiness
is
excellent
but
he
finish
is
rough
it
is
also
lacking
in
body
i
prefer
a
more
rich
beer
like
the
meredsous
10
or
8
this
is
still
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
stocking
it
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
but
if
you
cant
get
it
in
the
white
label
the
black
is
great
as
well
nice
cloudy
golden
straw
color
beautiful
white
frothy
head
that
never
quits
but
leaves
a
delicate
lace
as
you
drink
hoppy
citrus
aroma
dominates
the
nose
smells
clean
tastes
as
refreshing
as
it
looks
highly
carbonated
well
balanced
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
have
3
more
in
the
cellar
backwash
often
someone
on
the
forum
asks
which
beer
would
you
drink
if
it
were
your
desert
island
beer
well
i
cant
think
of
a
better
one
refreshing
complex
satisfying
and
devilishly
drinkable
appropriate
in
almost
every
circumstance
ive
seen
a
novelty
item
which
enclosed
a
cigarette
and
match
in
a
glass
tube
marked
break
glass
in
case
of
emergency
well
this
is
the
beer
i
would
want
in
that
bigger
tube
it
started
as
i
seen
the
bottle
it
was
the
only
one
left
sitting
on
the
counter
as
it
seemed
it
was
destined
for
me
to
cherish
for
the
night
as
i
poured
i
was
curious
as
one
of
the
most
noticable
details
was
the
foamy
top
that
reminded
me
of
such
south
american
beers
i
had
before
it
poured
a
rich
golden
blonde
with
a
sweet
aroma
and
luscious
fruity
essence
that
was
one
of
the
main
attractions
i
had
hoped
for
the
taste
was
rather
clean
and
crisp
with
a
warm
spice
of
after
taste
the
abv
of
8
5
was
cleary
masked
in
the
flavor
though
it
later
help
in
keeping
warm
this
is
a
keeper
if
you
have
a
chance
to
spot
the
black
label
give
this
a
try
a
delicate
white
bubbly
rocky
head
sits
a
top
a
body
of
hazy
golden
liquid
the
head
remained
throughout
consumption
carbonation
present
aroma
consists
of
saaz
hops
and
a
pleasant
fruit
slight
citrus
or
pear
scent
touch
of
alcohol
in
aroma
can
be
noticed
as
the
ale
warms
the
crispness
from
the
carbontation
dominates
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
exquisite
some
citrus
flavor
and
pepper
in
midtones
excellent
balance
to
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
warming
effect
noticed
as
it
goes
down
very
drinkable
for
having
an
8
5
abv
content
overall
astounding
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
colored
beer
that
pours
with
white
piloowy
head
that
seems
to
stay
perched
atop
the
beer
forever
very
fine
bubbles
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
trailing
up
through
the
liquid
the
lacing
this
beer
leaves
on
the
glass
leaves
no
doubt
why
the
call
it
belgian
lace
the
aroma
is
unmistakably
saaz
hops
with
some
similarities
to
pilsner
urquell
however
this
beer
has
much
more
going
on
in
the
nose
an
overall
sweetness
with
some
fruity
pear
notes
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
is
fantastic
at
first
it
doesnt
seem
like
much
is
going
on
but
then
the
flavors
start
developing
none
of
the
tastes
are
stronger
than
the
others
as
this
is
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
alcohol
notes
of
sweetness
are
present
immediately
but
just
a
hint
then
a
light
peppery
citrus
flavor
appears
only
to
be
replaced
by
a
spicy
bitterness
then
some
sweetness
reappears
but
its
different
than
the
initial
sweetness
the
finish
is
clean
but
yet
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
but
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
strong
as
it
tickles
the
back
of
my
throat
for
8
5
abv
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
present
in
sweetness
only
and
that
nice
warming
feeling
your
throat
gets
as
you
swallow
the
beer
i
could
easily
make
drinking
this
beer
a
regular
occurence
truly
an
exceptional
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
beautiful
golden
color
with
perhaps
the
most
magnificent
head
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
beerthick
rocky
and
creamy
white
that
you
can
have
billowing
out
of
the
top
of
your
glass
with
no
spillage
it
also
has
an
outstanding
retention
and
laces
the
sides
of
your
glass
as
the
head
eventually
dissipates
nose
is
clean
and
fruity
with
notes
of
citrus
sweet
malts
pepper
and
spice
a
light
fruitiness
of
orange
and
lemon
come
through
in
the
taste
upfront
with
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
and
spicy
hops
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
nice
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
on
the
planet
simply
delicious
im
not
as
into
belgians
as
some
here
at
ba
but
this
one
wowed
me
awesome
appearance
with
a
slightly
hazed
yellowish
hue
and
one
massive
white
rocky
head
that
lasted
longer
than
duracell
batteries
the
aromas
were
a
bit
strange
at
first
with
a
slight
skunky
twang
to
the
aromas
but
after
letting
it
sit
for
a
while
nice
fruity
esters
and
spices
with
a
slight
hint
of
yeast
in
the
background
revealed
themselves
the
taste
was
out
of
this
world
with
nicely
blending
of
yet
again
fruity
twang
spices
and
light
yet
not
sticky
yeast
and
alcohol
on
the
tail
it
has
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
simply
amazing

the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
spicy
with
hints
of
malt
flavor
is
malty

a

pours
pale
gold
with
a
massive
crown
of
stiff
white
foam
the
foam
fades
unevenly
leaving
peaks
and
crags
it
actually
looks
fairly
dry
and
sticky
i
had
expected
the
body
to
be
cloudy
from
yeast
but
it
was
clear
the
yeast
was
firmly
attached
to
the
bottom
and
i
had
not
left
any
beer
in
the
bottle
to
swirl
with
thinking
that
enough
yeast
would
come
out
that
i
wouldnt
have
too
since
i
wasnt
wanting
a
lot
of
yeast
in
the
beer
the
aroma
was
typical
spiciness
of
the
style
with
a
little
of
the
spicy
noble
hops
saaz
complimenting
the
yeast
spice
lemon
and
a
faint
sweetness
were
also
present
duvel
seems
a
bit
maltier
than
other
belgian
strong
pales
besides
the
malt
and
typical
yeasty
flavors
there
was
a
very
faint
hint
of
vanilla
and
cantaloupe
melon
there
was
also
a
very
faint
cheese
flavor
in
the
finish
the
flavor
leaves
the
palate
quickly
and
is
rather
dry
i
was
expecting
more
spice
from
this
beer
but
its
actually
quite
balanced
possibly
because
the
yeast
was
stuck
in
the
bottle
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
can
never
get
enough
of
the
taste
is
nice
and
peppery
with
hints
of
apple
cider
and
clove
in
there
as
well
finishes
abruptly
however
i
wasnt
quite
as
impressed
overall
as
most
of
the
other
reviewers
have
been
i
even
purchased
the
proper
duval
glass
the
second
time
around
which
i
love
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
missing
anything
i
mean
its
a
very
good
beer
and
ill
certainly
never
turn
one
down
but
im
much
more
impressed
by

seems
all

it
very
easy
to
drink
a
temptation
from
the
devil
a
class
beer
when
poured
slowly
into
a
duvel
glass
this
beer
is
beautifully
presented
half
of
the
glass
is
filled
with
the
pale
golden
elixir
which
is
only
slightly
hazy
since
i
left
about
2cm
in
the
bottle
to
keep
the
yeast

topped
off
with
a
huge

a
generous

well

steady
stream

bubbles

bottom

along
with
some
malt

in
the
background
on
the
palate
delicate

spicy
pepper
tickles
at
the
tongue
creating
a
tingly

smooth
mouthfeel
slightly
fruity
sweetness
is
the
major
player
here
and
goes
perfectly
with
the
spiciness
very
slight

character
shows
itself
in
a
rindlike
bitterness
around
the
middle
and
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
otherwise
sweet
but
is
dominated
by
the
aforementioned
hop
bitterness
the
high
alcohol
content
is
not
at
all
noticeable
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
a
god
among

truly
a
masterpiece

worthy
of
its

1000
beer
master
list
this
beer
poured
perfectly
clear
until
the
end
of
the
bottle
when
the
yeast
was
roused
a
perfect
decant
was
not
possible
as
the
head
was
literally
rising
out
of
the
glass
hazy
yellowgold
body
with
an
orangecast
topped
by
a
dense
rocky
brightwhite
head
that
holds
extremely
well
buoyed
by
a
tightbeaded
effervescent
carbonation

leaves
some
exceptional

quite
fragrant

with
an
extremely
fine
and
highly
effervescent
carbonation
that
is
pillowy
soft
and
velvety
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
full
and
rich
starting
with
a
candyish
malty
sweetness
becoming
dryish
in
the
middle
with
some
earthy
and
lightly
spicy
hop
flavors
and
finishing
long
and
malty
with
some
more
distinct
saaz
notes
and
touches
of
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
hidden
impressively
balanced
with
a
fresh
hop
presence
and
bitterness
that
dances
amongst
such
sweet
malt
character
amazing
as
michael
jackson
notes
duvel
is
equally
impressive
served
chilled
or
as
it
warms
toward
cellar
temperature
this
makes
it
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
as
a
glass
can
be
savored
over
a
period
of
time
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
world
and
absolutely
recommended
a
classic
in
every
right
an
intricately
crafted
perfectlybalanced
golden
yellow
champagne
of
a
beer
under
a
lacy
mountain
of
foam
that
dances
perilously
close
to
an
avalanche
when
poured
with
sweet
fruit
and
spice
this
beer
packs
a
warm
alcoholic
kick
in
the
arse
without
a
threatening
taste
or

slightly

quite
a

the
greats
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
brew
with
a
rocky
perfectly
white
head
banana
and
cloves
in
the
nose
very
nice
the
spice
in
the
beer
which
comes
out
first
was
accentuated
by
the
carbonation
next
came
the
alcohol
along
with
the
hops
slightly
bitter
and
warming
followed
by
the
malt
the
only
aftertaste
is
a
little
tartness
and
vanilla
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
started
my
love
affair
with
the
nectar
of
the
gods
or
in
this
case
the
devil
pours
into
the
goblet
with
a
heavy
frothy
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
the
whole
trip
the
very
pale
golden
color
is
enhanced
by
the
thin
ascending
bubble
trails
that
permeate
the
brew
the
very
fragrant
aroma
has
scents
of
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
bold
flavor
is
tart
with
a
strong
yeast
character
and
a
huge
alcoholic
warming
quality
this
beer
beats
out
any
good
wine
i
have
tried
a
very
tasty
libation
with
a
kick
and
a
half
poured
slowly
as
suggested
on
the
bottle
looked
like
water
as
poured
but
noted
the
fizzy
sound
huge
head
that
settled
very
slowly
with
big
bubbles
later
much
laciness
on
the
glass
aroma
changed
over
time
initially
light
malt
with
fruitiness
and
spice
that
turned
to
clove
pale
yellow
color
and
clear
taste
has
complexity
starts
off
light
moves
to
spiciness
cloves
and
some
fruitiness
with
malt
then
a
shot
of
alcohol
that
stays
to
the
finish
and
concludes
with
mild
lingering
somewhat
bitter
dryness
thinner
mouthfeel
and
despite
the
huge
head
the
carbonation
while
evident
doesnt
seem
excessive
yet
there
is
some
experience
of
fullness
very
interesting
beer
seems
worthy
of
its
higher
ranking
amongst
all
beers
i
will
try
this
again
you
have
to
watch
out
this
beer
is
quite
strong
but
doesnt
taste
like
it
is
itll
sneak
up
on
you
if
your
not
careful
as
i
can
attest
for
some
reason
i
just
can
not
get
as
hyped
as
a
lot
of
beer
lovers
do
over
belgians
maybe
there
is
an
antibelgian
beer
chromosone
in
my
familys
gene
pool
as
my
brother
zap
feels
the
same
way
about
belgians
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
this
foamy
golden
belgian
ale
is
meticulously
crafted
and
not
allowed
to
leave
the
brewery
until
ready
the
distinctive
large
white
head
and
the
mouthwatering
smell
of
spices
on
the
nose
rewards
the
drinker
with
a
burst
of
spice
on
the
tongue
that
one
will
never
forget
again
the
drinkability
does
not
belie
the
fact
that
it
is
a
high
gravity
brew
so
be
prepared
to
savor
the
experience
responsibly
the
devil
finally
caught
up
with
me
and
i
sold
my
soul
bright
pale
with
a
huge
frothy
head
the
massive
carbonation
made
it
very
easy
to
inhale
the
fruit
and
spice
in
the
nose
very
bubblyprickly
on
the
tongue
like
a
sparkling
wine
a
much
lighter
body
than
i
expected
the
unique
taste
of
the
fruity
yeast
and
pale
malts
makes
for
a
moderately
spicy
delicious
brew
the
hop
bitterness
gets
twisted
up
in
the
carbonation
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
8
5
abv
is
lost
in
all
the
sweet
spritzy
effervescent
action
way
too
refreshing
for
so
much
alcohol
so
be
careful
the
only
drawback
i
could
find
is
the
way
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
of
deciphering
flavors
on
the
tongue
making
for
an
odd
mouthfeel
the
bubbles
just
dance
in
my
mouth
nonetheless
a
great
brew
worthy
of
the
hype
i
think
the
devil
is
telling
me
to
go
buy
more
you
never
forget
your
first
belgian
and
what
a
winner
this
one
is
it
is
smooth
drinkable
and
has
a
very
fruitful
aroma
with
a
slight
bit
of
hoppiness
and
a
good
abv
kick
this
is
one
of
the
top
brews
in
the
world
bar
none
there
is
some
special
yeast
in
store
for
you
upon
tasting
you
are
enveloped
in
smooth
yeasty
richness
the
balence
is
helped
along
by
hints
of
fruit
and
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
not
for
the
timid
but
at
the
same
time
it
slides
down
effortlessly
the
look
of
this
brew
is
hypnotic
why
on
the
bottle
would
they
tell
you
not
to
drink
the
yeast
is
beyond
me
drink
it
drink
it
all
rich
and
hearty
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
they
do
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
8
5
the
taste
was
mild
concidering
the
8
5
alcohol
not
to
tart
and
not
over
spicy
i
find
it
not
enjoyable
at
all
for
a
belguim
ale
this
is
my
second
time
and
i
rated
it
less
than
the
first
time
like
most
belgian
ales
more
heavily
carbonated
than
i
appreciate
otherwise
this
is
an
excellent
beer
dangerously
drinkable
hence
the
name
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
pleasant
with
a
soothing
aftertaste
like
drinking
fine
brandy
or
wine
dark
reddish
in
color
with
a
moderate
head
spicy
indeed
with
somewhat
floral
tones
alcohol
taste
comes
through
and
makes
for
a
nice
finish
drink
this
one
slow
its
a
nice
looking
beer
with
a
big
white
head
its
got
a
pretty
good
spicy
smell
and
a
somewhat
sweet
taste
with
spicy
undertones
i
found
the
flavor
and
smell
of
alcohol
to
be
surprisingly
high
for
8
5
it
seems
less
noticeable
in
other
belgians
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
even
if
you
dont
like
belgians
or
appreciate
the
style
if
you
love
beer
i
do
you
cannot
help
but
exclaim
that
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
truly
brilliant
concoctions
flavour

head
head
head
and
finish
finish
finish
without
question
one
of
the
worlds
most
perfect
brews
a
skeptic
no
longer
from
the
sheer
beauty
as
it
rests
to
the
citrusy
spice
nose
from
the
blend
of
slight
sweetness
to
a
tart
bite
and
finally
bitter
but
a
clean
sort
of
bitter
as
if
the
carbonation
had
swept
the
bitterness
away
yes
its
lively
for
sure
full
lively
not
harsh
lively
nary
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
am
possessed
duvel
how
can
you
be
so
bubbly
and
so
smooth
duvel
i
love
you
duvel
is
legendary
the
name
and
especially
its
appearance
beautiful
thick
belgian
head
and
a
strong
yeasty
smell
extremely
strong
stuff
that
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
have
too
many
too
spicy
and
yeasty
to
drink
many
of
them
anyway
but
great
to
get
that
big
bottle
every
now
and
then
to
enjoy
a
truly
renowned
beer
in
many
ways
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
belgian
strong
ales
golden
bubbly
spicy
intoxicating
brew
i
love
this
beer
however
if
given
a
choice
between
this
and
a
beer
such
as
victorys
golden
monkey
or
unibroues
don
de
dieu
the
latter
beers
will
win
hopefully
i
will
never
be
in
a
situation
where
i
will
have
to
choose
one
over
the
other
where
are
those
crazy
monks
who
brew
this
stuff
i
want
to
party
with
those
guys
duvel
is
a
very
fine
beer
is
it
my
favorite
belgium
no
but
it
is
good
hints
of
fruit
in
the
taste
and
nice
warming
alcohol
presence
a
second
bottlefermentation
so
charged
up
foamy
mediumbubbled
head
misty
champagne
color
and
bubbly
upcharge
astringent
aroma
with
a
malt
background
light
vinous
flavors
and
swallows
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
theres
a
slight
hoppy
cut
to
the
initial
flavor
and
in
the
midmouth
feel
theres
a
lot
of
sparkling
winelike
flavor
it
is
interesting
a
modern
classic
finely
brewed
but
not
for
my
normal
tastes
tart
and
bready
at
the
same
time
but
i
found
it
to
have
a
higher
than
expected
drinkability
this
brew
is
beautiful
in
a
duvel
glass
theres
that
central
geyser
of
carbonation
charging
up
from
the
center
and
a
head
as
rocky
as
a
bowl
of
popcorn
after
a
long
time
i
finally
tried
this
out
let
me
tell
you
i
was
not
disappointed
i
must
admit
belgian
style
beers
are
not
my
all
time
fav
but
i
do
enjoy
them
and
this
one
in
particular
it
poured
out
a
nice
light
yellow
color
reminiscent
of
champagne
a
light
pillowy
head
formed
at
the
top
and
appeared
almost
meringuelike
but
not
super
creamy
the
aroma
was
light
and
spicey
with
some
subdued
yeast
had
a
pleasantly
light
citrus
and
spice
flavor
with
a
light
alcoholic
echo
in
the
background
almost
unnoticeable
nice
effervescence
dryslight
yeast
and
nice
warming
after
effect
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
nice
great
belgian
absolutely
beautiful
beer
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
classic
dense
thick
white
head
a
full
inch
and
a
quarter
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
without
any
spill
duvel
has
a
very
pronounced
fruity
aroma
lemons
and
pears
the
first
bottle
i
had
i
did
not
realize
that
there
was
some
yeast
in
the
bottle
although
i
love
the
yeast
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
very
fruity
somewhat
dry
finish
very
pleasant
for
a
beer
with
this
amount
of
alcohol
i
do
not
get
the
alcohol
warmth
from
other
high
octane
beers
looks
great
smells
good
very
drinkable
but
to
me
it
misses
the
essence
of
a
good
beer
great
for
its
style
but
it
aint
my
style
addendum
more
than
a
slight
hangover
the
next
morning
my
initial
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
overrated
that
said
its
still
pretty
good
i
am
unclear
on
the
delineation
between
a
tripel
and
this
style
no
matter
prolific
frothy
head
very
pale
vaguely
reminiscent
of
ayings
jahrhundert
although
milkier
and
lacking
the
lager
characteristics
also
a
hidden
spice
but
this
is
very
subtle
it
is
an
unseasonably
hot
and
humid
day
today
and
this
seems
to
be
affecting
the
beer
in
positive
ways
it
is
crisper
more
refreshing
this
is
the
3rd
bottle
of
a
4
pack
and
the
most
enjoyable
so
far
the
first
2
and
this
one
to
a
lesser
extent
had
vague
euroskunky
characteristics
much
like
heineken
expiration
date
is
504
so
that
cant
be
it
i
wonder
if
this
is
a
slightly
off
batch
since
ive
recently
had
victory
golden
monkey
and
unibroue
eau
benite
and
greatly
prefer
them
both
to
this
worldclass
toprated
brew
this
is
what
the
style
is
all
about
strong
but
easy
to
drink
with
its
sweet
fruity
spicy
flavors
wonderful
head
and
high
belgian
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
one
perfect
package
i
never
would
tire
of
this
recommended
to
the
fullest
i
have
finally
found
one
of
the
nectars
of
the
gods
duvel
is
fabulous
from
its
cloudy
apperance
to
its
peppery
spice
taste
this
brew
is
dangerous
to
drink
at
8
5
it
will
rock
your
world
in
a
hurry
with
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
duvel
is
deceivingly
light
but
has
a
myriad
of
flavors
its
got
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
and
a
nice
touch
of
clove
in
the
finish
duvels
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
belgian
beers
and
is
way
too
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
be
sure
to
try
this
one
in
the
11
ounce
bottle
i
had
several
of
the
large
bottles
flat
its
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
great
appearnce
nice
flavour
bitter
finish
all
good
things
but
just
lacked
something
duvel
beligian
alenice
fogged
hazy
peach
color
fruity
complex
but
very
balanced
very
fine
brew
dont
drink
to
many
8

abv
will
make
you
see
double
price
for
a
case
around
philly
will
leave
you
crying
asking
were
is
all
my
money
its
between
4550
a
case
extremely
carbonated
quite
a
spectacle
head
froths
so
easily
and
endures
long
long
after
initial
pour
super
pale
yellow
almost
white
mellow
spices
on
the
nose
a
typical
belgian
scent
initial
shock
comes
when
the
razor
sharp
bittersweetness
hits
your
tongue
follows
through
with
a
spicey
almost
hot
notes
the
flavor
penetrates
deep
into
the
palate
leaving
a
long
aftertaste
a
sharp
tangy
crisp
mouthfeel
would
be
quite
the
summer
refresher
beer
despite
the
8
5
abv
always
wanted
to
try
this
infamous
brew
was
worth
9
for
the
fourpack
giant
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
forever
and
laces
the
obligatory
belgian
chalice
fruity
malt
in
the
nose
followed
by
a
deceptively
smooth
taste
for
the
alcohol
content
spicy
malt
followed
by
a
long
dryish
hop
finish
lovely
to
watch
the
champagne
like
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
as
i
savor
this
first
class
belgian
this
beer
deserves
its
place
in
history
just
the
right
mix
of
hops
and
sweetness
for
a
crisp
clean
flavor
that
somehow
hides
its
devilish
alcohol
content
what
can
i
possibly
say
this
is
a
world
classic
one
of
the
greatest
beers
brewed
bar
none
youve
got
to
drink
this
one
in
the
proper
glass
if
you
want
to
contain
the
massive
head
fruity
and
complex
in
a
clean
delicate
way
more
than
750
ml
and
im
down
for
the
count
outstanding
brew
remarkable
fruity
flavor
imparted
by
the
yeast
i
prefer
to
let
this
warm
a
bit
and
let
some
of
the
carbonation
dissipate
before
drinking
nice
and
peppery
so
smooth
and
mild
i
cant
believe
it
has
an
abv
of
8
5
wait
whats
that
buzzing
sound
i
hear
i
guess
i
can
believe
it
i
reviwed
this
a
year
ago
and
felt
tit
was
time
for
an
update
poured
into
the

with
a
big

crisp

drinkable
its
scary
tastes
like

around
like

could
you
ask

not
unibroues
best
go
for

instead
overall
a
good
beer
but
hoped
for
something
more
from
unibroue
great
brewery
just
not
as
much
flavor
or
anything
that
stood
out
to
me
from
this
beer
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
yum
very
good
unibroue
does
it
again
a
soft
pour
resulted
in
carbonation
that
you
could
hear
not
just
see
the
strong
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
central
nucleation
point
persisted
for
a
long
time
even
after
calming
down

there

so
its

the
best

belgianstyle
beers
out
there
excellent
balance
and
full
of
flavor
an
asskicker
at
9
but
easily
drinkable
a
classic
for
the
holidays
tasted
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
kind
of
like
a
cider
rjt
overall
smells
nice
and
fruity
a
little
boring
and
not
hitting
the
right
notes
for
me
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
as
lively
as
some
in
the
style
and
not
quite
as
interesting
as
some
of
unibroues
other
offerings
but
this
is
very
good
enjoy
final
grade
4
34
an
excellent
a
i
love
me
some
belgian
strong
pale
ales
and
don
de
dieu
is
one
of
the
absolute
best
ive
found
fans
of
their
la
fin
du
monde
will
find
a
lot
to
appreciate
in
this
one
though
as
a
bspa
it
definitely
lacks
much
of
the
spicy
yeasty
kick
found
in
its
sister
tripel
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
unibroues
very
impressive
yearround
portfolio
and
a
definite
musttry
for
any
fan
of
belgianstyle
beers
hopefully
this
one
returns
to
the
lcbo
in
a
more
convenient
format
at
some
point
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
damn
yes
this
is
a
beer
that
you
have
to
give
it
a
try
in
your
existence
you
can
t
go
wrong
with
unibroue
you
want
a
strong
blond
belgian
ale
go
and
grab
don
de
dieu
everyone
seems
to
love
their
la
fin
de
monde
with
great
reason
but
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
ill
drink
this
everyday
and
not
get
tired
of
it
overall
very
well
crafted
belgian
pale
ale
with
only
subtle
alcoholic
suggestions
that
lie
beneath
delicious
and
extremely
well
crafted
don
de
dieu
is
another
great
brew
from
the
unibroue
folks
it
looks
great
has
a
complex
nose
and
taste
plus
the
mouthfeel
tickles
like
champagne
all
the
standard
goodness
of
belgian
ales
are
present
it
may
not
hit
the
high
note
of
la
fin
de
monde
but
id
never
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
overall
another
outstanding
brew
from
unibroue
easily
and
happily
had
two
with
dinner
you
want
to
know
what
this
tastes
like
well
the
brewerys
notes
cover
it
all
this
beer
is
phenomenal
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
oh
so
worth
it
i
found
it
very
light
in
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
o
delicious
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
this
will
be
a
regular
addition
to
my
mixsixes
from
now
on
great
complexity
excellent
fruity
notes
its
a
bit
boozy
but
tasty
a
belgian
pale
the
way
a
belgian
brewery
would
make
one
nice
departure
from
the
americanized
versions
of
the
style
this
is
hard
to
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
bevmo
and
total
wines
usually
dont
carry
this
unibroue
offering
thanks
whole
foods
ill
be
back
121913
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
now
this
is
a
beer
middecember
cold
as
a
outside
but
this
cool
low
alcohol
beverage
hits
the
spot
welcoming
spiciness
greet
me
on
the
nose
tongue
the
familiar
yeasty
aroma
of
unibroue
adds
to
this
homecoming
i
dont
know
whoever
made
this
but
they
know
me
i
thank
you
one
and
all
xxoo
its
hard
to
describe
this
but
it
is
a
unique
belgian
ale
with
a
sweet
coriander
malt
richness
smells
great
tastes
great
so
for
all
the
ales
from
uniboue
are
excellent
im
seeking
out
there
other
offereings
as
well
to
try
them
out
unibroue
is
so
far
ahead
of
its
north
american
competition
its
painful
for
their
challengers
while
the
competition
continue
toil
away
in
their
basements
with
their
poor
experiments
they
call
beer
victory
golden
monkey
anyone
unibroue
continue
weave
golden
wheat
into
bottles
to
create
magic
o
an
extremely
well
done
belgian
strong
pale
ale
everything
just
comes
together
well
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
very
smooth
sweet
doesnt
taste
very
beer
like
its
pretty
good
but
its
just
not
my
type
of
beer
as
you
drink
more
it
gets
better
but
i
guess
all
alcohols
like
that
reminds
me
of
wine
so
dont
buy
it
if
youre
not
into
that
sort
of
thing
c
overall
i
like
this
beer
as
a
wheatwine
and
i
guess
also
as
a
belgian
pale
its
rather
sweet
with
spice
tones
that
make
it
unique
buy
this
if
you
like
lighter
beers
but
are
not
afraid
to
try
one
at
9
there
is
something
special
about
the
unibroue
alesbeers
this
one
is
no
exception
to
the
greatness
from
this
canadian
brewery
i
wont
go
through
the
normal
smell
taste
and
what
not
its
what
a
belgian
should
be
boldspicy
and
leaves
you
satisfied
just
be
careful
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
cheers
o
pretty
good
another
solid
beer
from
unibroue
the
verdict
brilliant
stuff
from
the
folks
at
unibroue
my
only
complaints
would
be
the
relatively
poor
head
retention
and
ddds
9
99
per
bottle
price
tag
which
cost
it
a
couple
of
points
on
the
value
for
money
factor
this
definitely
goes
onto
my
special
treat
list
and
becomes
a
must
buy
when
in
montreal
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
o
very
good
for
a
belgian
ale
complex
and
enjoyable
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
if
aged
truly
a
delight
to
drink
i
really
enjoy
what
unibroue
has
to
offer
and
need
to
visit
their
beers
more
often
overall
im
disappointed
im
certainly
not
aided
by
the
fact
that
my
last
beer
was
a
la
fin
du
monde
don
de
dieu
is
still
above
average
but
with
so
many
amazing
belgianstyle
beers
out
there
this
one
struggles
to
hold
up
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
goblet
two
finger
white
head
reduces
to
very
thick
clinging
lacing
lovely
unfiltered
deep
amber
color
aroma
is
something
i
have
never
encountered
before
herbal
yeasty
unfamiliar
to
me
wierd
and
not
entirely
pleasant
flavor
is
a
bit
sour
yeasty
herbal
not
fruity
i
have
to
say
here
that
i
have
not
learned
to
appreciate
wheat
ales
and
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
not
overly
carbonated
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
care
for
this
style
of
ale
and
do
not
plan
on
trying
it
again
soon
you
will
get
more
helpful
reviews
from
those
who
understand
and
appreciate
yeasty
wheat
ales
pours
a
copperyellow
hue
with
a
very
healthy
white
foam
head
has
a
sweet
wheat
and
yeast
aroma
along
with
some
hints
of
fruit
taste
is
sweet
wheat
and
yeast
with
some
apple
and
honey
and
then
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
has
a
full
body
feel
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
this
is
most
definitely
a
gift
of
god
and
is
one
of
my
favorites
from

comes
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
very
strong
sweet
citrus
fragrance
that
is
very
pleasing
to
the
senses
and
its
hazy
golden
color
matches
its
aroma
perfectly
it
has
a
very
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
into
almost
nothing
and
has
some
very
mild
lacing
and
carbonation
it
has
a
strong
fresh
and
crisp
taste
when
it
hits
your
tongue
and
is
accompanied
by
a
semisweet
aftertaste
that
seems
resemble
bananas
mixed
in
with
a
hint
of
alcohol

id
definitely
go

taste
starts

with
an
immediate
crash

crisp
carbonation
particularly
in

and
malty
sweetness
a
certain
spiciness
makes
itself
known
as
the
smooth
but
strong
warmth
gradually
takes
over
particularly
given
the
alcohol
content
this
is
wonderfully
smooth

the

is

medium

wonderful

so
far
unibroue
can
do
no
wrong
this
ale
on
lees
which
is
a
fancy
term
for
bottled
conditioned
ale
has
a
wonderful
spice
kick
to
it
that
i
just
cant
place
maybe
a
touch
more
coriander
or
cardamon
it
has
a
cloudy
appearance
so
i
assume
they
use
some
wheat
adjuncts
as
they
do
with
some
of
their
other
beers
then
again
perhaps
that
spicey
kick
is
from
rye
it
had
a
nice
foamy
and
a
wonderfully
silky
mouthfeel
it
went
down
well
on
a
humid
saturday
below
the
masondixon
line
not
a
session
brew
by
any
stretch
but
always
a
good
pick
for
a
special
occasion
or
when
you
want
something
a
little
extra
in
your
glass
i
had
this
brew
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
my
new
unibroue
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
2
fingers
of
foam
that
are
gone
quickly
there
is
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
fruit
mostly
a
grape
aroma
the
smell
is
very
sweet
the
taste
is
also
sweet
there
is
a
bit
of
apple
taste
and
some
clove
spice
there
are
a
few
hops
to
balance
it
all
out
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
even
at
9
this
beer
is
immaculate
the
appearance
is
an
apricot
toned
body
with
a
vibrant
massive
white
head
with
fine
lacing
layering
my
tulip
shaped
glass
the
aroma
of
this
fine
constructed
brew
de
chambly
is
layered
and
complex
with
a
nose
of
sharply
sweet
malted
wheat
vinous
fruit
tones
shimmering
in
the
distance
along
with
a
yeast
sent
from
the
heavens
to
form
such
a
piece
of
work
light
alchol
notes
can
also
be
detected
in
the
flavor
underneath
all
of
this
making
it
refreshing
yet
warming
at
the
same
time
sweet
apple
butter
tones
with
honey
drizzled
on
it
with
the
spices
added
by
unibroue
combine
so
well
on
my
palate
this
beer
is
magnificant
i
am
enjoying
this
so
much
this
could
very
well
be
my
favorite
unibroue
beer
to
date
simply
amazing
a
must
try
for
any
beer
enthusiast
the
full
body
allows
this
beer
to
be
slowly
enjoyed
the
way
it
should
be
and
the
high
carbonation
lets
the
flavors
travel
so
well
along
the
palate
very
drinkable
beer
one
to
be
yearned
for
but
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
at
9
by
volume
this
belgian
strong
ale
poured
a
large
invigorating
white
creamy
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
had
a
cloudy
yellow
appearance
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
was
that
of
apples
and
grapes
there
was
yeast
and
carbonation
observed
with
this
brew
the
taste
was
very
smooth
in
my
opinion
very
dissapointing
pour
and
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
unibroue
poured
a
quick
fizzy
white
head
that
dissolved
to
nothing
tons
of
bubbling
carbonation
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
alkaseltzer
with
the
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
bottle
left
sediment
at
the
bottom
the
color
looks
lke
a
gold
to
yellow
and
a
touch
cloudy
extremely
crisp
mouthfeel
almost
harsh
on
the
finish
alcohol
seems
to
be
wellhidden
but
im
sure
it
will
catch
up
to
me
soon
feel
a
warming
sensation
in
the
stomach
so
the
alcohol
is
kicking
in
no
real
distinct
aroma
or
tastes
that
stand
out
faint
lingering
bitterness
in
the
throat
but
nothing
too
strong
a
sweet
light
caramel
malt
aroma
very
dry
finish
probably
due
to
the
high
abv
between
the
high
alcohol
and
the
extreme
carbonation
it
makes
the
mouthfeel
harsh
and
the
drinker
quick
to
swallow
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
from
unibroue
and
will
not
try
it
again
this
brew
poured
a
large
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
leaves
no
lacing
and
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
body
with
a
lot
of
dark
brown
particles
floating
in
it
there
were
a
lot
more
particles
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
nice
banana
malt
aroma
about
it
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
complex
with
notes
of
butter
banana
spice
and
mild
clove
it
is
a
very
smooth
brrew
that
leaves
a
slight
tingling
mouthfeel
in
tits
finish
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
its
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
damn
huge
whipped
head
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
rise
up
very
enjoyable
aroma
od
sweetness
and
lemoncitrus
zest
this
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
strong
twang
throughout
fruity
notes
and
spicy
notes
are
there
in
abundance
the
finish
is
super
dry
and
crisp
i
cant
believe
how
refreshing
this
beer
seems
to
be
for
9
abv
the
alcohol
level
of
highness
is
nonexistent
until
it
warms
to
room
temperature
wonderful
stuff
from
a
brewery
that
never
seems
to
go
wrong
unibroue
tries
and
tries
but
ive
yet
to
find
them
producing
a
truly
outstanding
beer
medium
gold
body
with
slightly
fizzy
white
head
despite
excessive
carbonation
head
stays
relatively
small
for
style
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
yeasty
and
the
flavor
is
nicely
fruity
with
bananas
and
pears
could
use
a
little
less
carbonation
however
for
the
lightness
of
the
beer
it
covers
the
9
extremely
well
although
i
did
pick
up
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
an
unfortunately
medicinal
quality
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
very
light
yellow
almost
white
you
can
see
some
sediment
inside
it
thin
pure
white
head
a
little
lingers
for
the
length
of
the
beer
decent
lacing
fantastic
aroma
smells
of
apples
some
vanilla
some
wheat
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
brew
can
still
taste
those
apples
a
little
sweet
at
first
but
it
turns
creamy
at
last
some
citrus
flavors
as
well
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
milky
lemon
colored
that
seemed
to
have
a
darker
core
that
looked
to
be
either
burnt
orange
or
brown
in
color
it
was
opaque
but
you
could
see
carbonation
bubbles
present
the
head
was
thick
and
rich
white
in
color
and
well
lasting
to
mid
glass
then
subsiding
to
a
respectable
top
covering
and
ring
as
it
sat
on
top
of
the
brew
the
lace
that
it
left
behind
was
watery
in
texture
but
very
present
the
aromas
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
malts
caramel
fruits
alcohol
spicy
hops
roasted
nuts
yeast
and
a
small
hint
of
coconut
generally
sweet
in
nature
that
i
noticed
the
flavors
that
jumped
out
at
me
and
all
over
my
tongue
were
pretty
consistent
with
the
nose
flavors
of
caramels
sweet
malts
warming
alcohols
big
fruits
roasted
nuts
grapefruit
spicy
hops
and
yeast
were
all
blended
together
nicely
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
all
the
complex
flavors
that
were
in
this
bottle
seemed
to
match
very
well
with
each
other
and
the
high
alcohol
content
that
is
produced
nothing
out
did
each
other
which
makes
this
a
top
notch
brew
smooth
rich
and
big
are
three
words
that
i
would
use
to
describe
this
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
will
keep
a
few
bottles
around
for
a
special
treat
on
special
days
this
is
my
favorite
unibroue
product
i
have
not
been
unimpressed
by
any
of
their
brews
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
makes
westmalle
duvel
red
chimay
white
and
la
trappe
look
like
ugly
redheaded
bastard
stepchildren
on
with
the
beatings
fruity
tangy
spicey
pale
head
and
light
golden
hue
i
think
this
beer
sums
unibroue
up
in
a
single
bottle
though
it
may
be
a
little
more
on
the
fruitier
side
these
crazy
canadians
are
on
to
something
and
its
something
we
should
pay
close
attention
to
if
you
see
a
750
buy
it
and
drink
it
its
refreshing
and
warming
at
the
same
time
youll
be
tipsy
and
satisfied
poured
a
very
yellow
with
some
gold
a
good
bubbly
head
some
steady
tiny
carbonation
but
not
much
and
good
lace
very
nice
stringy
looking
stain
like
that
nose
was
zingy
yet
fullbodied
wheat
and
sweet
quiet
cloves
some
hops
styrian
scents
were
very
clean
and
in
time
some
winelike
esters
started
popping
up
the
taste
was
a
typical
golden
pale
ale
light
wheat
and
malt
lemony
hops
but
not
much
moderate
in
profile
i
experienced
a
light
honey
taste
developing
around
my
tongue
with
time
as
well
as
a
winetasting
burp
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
little
finish
good
beer
aint
no
duvel
though
pours
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
leave
a
good
amount
of
lacing
when
sipped
down
the
aroma
is
sweet
candi
sugar
spicy
and
medicinal
the
unibroue
products
seem
to
all
smell
the
same
i
need
to
try
all
the
unibroue
beers
together
it
has
a
sweet
medicinal
flavor
haylike
as
well
it
is
fullbodied
smooth
with
a
sweet
finish
it
has
a
strength
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
ive
had
more
than
one
duvel
at
a
time
but
cannot
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
a
very
full
complex
and
creamy
beer
wonderful
but
really
more
of
a
cap
to
an
evening
a
little
too
much
like
its
cousin
la
fin
du
monde
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
had
a
little
too
much
citrus
and
a
little
too
much
sweetness
this
was
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
it
had
a
larger
head
that
dissapeared
rather
quickly
and
an
almost
overpowering
yeast
smell
heavy
on
the
fruity
taste
with
slight
caramel
and
or
honey
overtone
i
liked
this
but
it
doesnt
go
in
my
top
ten
it
is
easy
to
drink
however
due
to
the
sweetness
and
with
its
9
abv
one
ight
tend
to
go
overboard
and
not
know
it
i
may
have
a
new
favorite
beer
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
unibroues
excellent
la
fin
du
monde
but
with
a
bit
more
too
much
sweetness
like
all
of
the
offerings
from
unibroue
this
one
hides
its
considerable
alcohol
content
very
well
and
is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
a
very
good
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
night
ok
call
me
crazy
i
dont
see
anyone
else
in
the
reviews
who
picked
up
anything
floral
thats
my
first
reaction
and
ill
stick
to
it
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
an
excellent
beer
a
good
deal
of
yeast
coupled
with
a
peppery
spiciness
smooth
as
hell
and
really
tasty
this
is
an
excellent
beer
unibroue
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
two
thumbs
up
for
an
excellent
ale
a
nice
tingly
carbonation
starts
you
off
right
with
crispness
the
pale
malts
and
wheat
form
a
great
balance
with
the
fine
yeast
then
you
get
a
little
spicy
flavor
and
a
hit
of
alcohol
in
the
end
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
strange
coming
from
unibroue
they
usually
hide
the
alcohol
and
tone
it
down
much
more
it
is
still
excellent
and
i
will
surely
have
it
again
as
it
drinks
well
and
has
a
great
feel
to
it
an
all
around
champ
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
overall
a
very
good
beer
another
bottle
fermented
winner
from
unibroue
the
smell
is
unibroue
spicy
with
fruit
the
front
is
sweet
with
a
capital
swee
and
spicy
the
middle
is
apples
the
finish
is
dry
and
just
a
little
chalky
this
one
is
sweeter
than
the
others
but
with
all
the
strong
flavors
its
not
bad
i
wonder
if
i
could
mix
this
with
a
blanche
de
chambly
nice
beer
for
a
100th
review
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
gold
foil
covering
the
cap
and
part
of
the
neck
as
i
uncapped
the
bottle
i
could
already
smell
the
wheat
and
yeast
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
rising
delicate
white
foamy
head
aroma
has
a
strong
fruity
essence
yeast
cloves
banana
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
light
carbonation
the
taste
consists
of
wheat
lemony
citrus
banana
spice
and
cloves
the
alcohol
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
and
you
are
reminded
of
the
9
abv
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
softens
and
don
de
dieu
becomes
even
more
enjoyable
as
the
flavors
reveal
themselves
even
further
at
this
stage
i
bought
the
12oz
bottle
with
the
ship
on
the
label
poured
a
nice
carbonated
golden
color
slight
sediment
more
than
i
usually
exspect
from
unibroue
nice
taste
not
a
lot
unlike
unibroue
11
good
fruity
taste
but
the
abv
was
not
as
hidden
as
im
used
too
not
unibroues

not
bad

not

a
slightly

very
appetizing

where
the
aroma
left
off
albeit
with
an

character
devoid

harshness
its
reminescent
of
tripel
karmeliet
although
not
quite
as
complex
perfect
with
foodeither
a
banquet
or
a
picnic
a
lot
like
a
witbier
but
with
more
body
flavor
and
punch
for
whatever
reason
the
last
couple
of
times
ive
had
this
it
hasnt
appealed
to
me
quite
as
much
as
before
i
had
it
last
night
between
a
la
fin
and
a
duvel
and
it
wasnt
quite
as
tasty
as
the
other
two
still
a
great
beer
but
somehow
it
has
dropped
a
notch
for
me
wow
quite
an
impressive
brew
i
could
smell
the
spicy
fruity
aroma
the
second
i
cracked
the
cap
off
it
smells
absolutely
wonderful
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
offyellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
retains
well
mouthfeel
is
quite
bubbly
almost
champagnelike
and
the
flavors
come
flying
out
the
moment
you
sip
it
a
bit
of
grassy
spiciness
follows
the
yeasty
fruity
nearly
sweet
beginning
one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
pales
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
simply
put
a
delectable
brew
and
9
youd
never
know
it
this
is
my
favorite
unibroue
product
so
far
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
white
medium
head
and
constant
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
fruit
mostly
white
grapes
and
apple
the
taste
also
includes
these
flavors
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
the
flavor
being
emphasized
by
the
carbonation
alot
of
bubbles
in
this
brew
this
is
the
smoothest
and
lightest

have

this

poured
a

some

the

this
is
something
i
could
get
into

i
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
but
it
does
go
down
easy
for
such
a
strong
beer
got
this
bad
boy
in
the
unibroue
variety
case
i
didnt
like
a
single
beer
in
the
case
upon
my
initial
tasting
until
i
found
out
they
havent
gone
bad
theyre
supposed
to
taste
like
that
after
overcoming
that
hurdle
they
began
to
grow
on
me
its
funny
how
fast
unfamiliar
styles
of
beer
can
grow
on
someone
after
they
get
taken
to
school
thanks
to
the
fellow
bas
who
helped
me
out
don
de
dieu
is
a
very
carbonated
medium
bodied
belgian
style
pale
ale
that
tastes
like
an
overripe
bananna
i
also
detected
some
notes
of
other
ripe
fruit
like
pear
and
apple
but
overall
the
yeast
character
plays
the
leading
role
in
this
one
the
finish
is
very
dry
although
this
is
by
no
means
a
mediocre
beer
it
tastes
like
slightly
watered
down
la
fin
to
me
if
i
could
get
this
but
not
la
fin
i
would
definfitely
go
for
this
but
la
fin
is
just
so
much
better
f
this
belgianstyle
strong
ale
poured
a
pale
golden
color
aroma
of
yeast
hops
and
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spices
taste
was
very
pleasant
although
high
in
alcolhol
it
didnt
mask
the
true
flavor
of
the
ale
not
to
say
it
is
bad
beer
far
from
it
its
just
that
there
are
better
choices
10
maudite
and
fin
de
monde
are
much
better
and
even
the
quelque
chose
their
cherry
beer
at
least
tried
to
be
different
this
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
that
retains
very
well
smell
is
heavy
on
yeast
hops
and
fruit
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
a
little
tart
with
lingering
notes
of
apple
and
apricot
mouthfeel
is
fitting
with
a
carbonated
backbone
that
provides
a
very
welcomed
prickliness
on
the
tongue
for
a
beer
of
9
abv
this
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
a
true
winner
this
beer
is
very
good
it
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
body
is
a
nice
hazy
yellow
the
aroma
is
complex
and
difficult
to
describe
as
is
the
spicy
flavor
fruity
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
nice
malt
flavor
the
alcohol
is
detectable
but
the
beer
still
remains
remarkably
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
the
priveledge
to
enjoy
very
spicy
beer
reminiscent
of
a
german
weiss
cloudy
goldorange
and
well
carbonated
spicyphenolic
aroma
and
taste
quite
drinkable
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
solid
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
is
one
wild
and
strong
ale
belgian
style
at
that
this
is
one
beer
i
dont
drink
enough
of
and
should
well
its
a
good
beer
that
can
certainly
be
said
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
too
weak
and
it
fails
to
really
mask
the
alcohol
i
like
the
colour
a
pale
cloudy
gold
but
the
head
was
rather
small
especially
in
comparison
to
other
beers
of
the
type
it
kind
of
fails
to
distinguish
itself
like
fin
du
monde
though
a
beautiful
beer
in
all
regards
a
fruity
slightly
yeasty
nose
a
very
fine
almost
champaignlike
carbonation
that
balances
the
heavy
mouthfeel
leaving
a
light
aftertaste
of
dried
fruit
apricots
i
drank
this
while
eating
a
mixedfruit
salad
and
it
just
made
the
picnic
perfect
quite
hazy
even
in
a
longstored
and
carefully
poured
bottle
orangemarmalade
in
color
and
topped
by
a
rocky
brightwhite
head
that
eventually
drops
to
an
exceptionally
creamy
14
covering
and
leaves
excellent
lace
the
aroma
is
bold
quite
yeasty
fruity
orange
rind
dried
apricot
citrusy
spicy
i
keep
looking
for
more
but
dont
find
it
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
very
fine
tiny
bubbled
and
effervescent
carbonation
and
gives
a
creamy
texture
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
mouthfilling
and
extravagant
following
the
aromas
lead
with
orange
citrus
and
clove
atop
a
gentle
malty
sweetness
awash
in
alcohol
it
starts
boldly
sweet
upfront
revealing
soft
spices
as
it
warms
and
finishes
semidry
with
lingering
notes
of
dried
fruits
the
spice
eventually
builds
to
leave
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
quite
intense
very
enjoyable
thanks
go
out
to
cokes
for
leaving
me
with
this
gift
from
god
scores
better
than
the
la
fin
du
monde
i
just
had
this
thing
is
a
virtual
fruit
bowl
of
aromas
and
flavors
ripe
peaches
bananas
and
spicy
yeasties
abound
slighty
sweet
start
finishes
drier
and
slightly
tart
wonderfully
complex
and
flavorful
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
snow
white
head
of
2
fingers
it
dissipates
rather
quickly
into
lumpy
leftovers
the
smell
is
that
of
strong
fruit
and
alcohol
of
the
fruity
flavored
beers
that
unibroue
puts
out
this
one
is
put
together
well
at
9
alcohol
whew
thats
what
i
have
to
say
about
that
it
has
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
but
its
drinkability
doesnt
suffer
imho
a
votre
sante
again
and
again
pours
with
a
monstrous
pure
white
head
golden
colored
liquid
with
slight
haze
very
lively
carbonation
nose
is
spicy
reminiscent
of
belgian
witbier
tastes
great
with
a
nice
fruity
light
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
tropical
fruit
esters
present
smooth
going
down
nice
finish
not
a
hint
of
the
9
alcohol
contained
within
a
very
decievable
yet
very
drinkable
ale
be
careful
with
this
one
cloudy
orangey
appearance
and
fruity
aroma
sweet
fruity
flavor
hides
some
of
the
sharp
phenols
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
is
good
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
i
like
the
la
fin
du
monde
much
better
effervescent
amber
color
leaning
toward
the
yellow
rather
than
the
orange
head
settles
to
a
skim
after
30
seconds
slightly
lemony
sweetgrass
smell
touch
of
candy
taste
is
dense
but
subdued
sweet
malts
lemon
rind
and
very
enforced
by
aroma
sense
of
alcohol
warming
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
in
the
stomach
powerful
impact
but
only
medium
bodied
hops
balance
well
in
mid
mouth
a
wellmade
brew
a
little
too
heavy
duty
and
toward
the
sweet
lemon
side
to
my
tastes
prefer
maudite
this
is
one
great
beer
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
tantalizing
color
and
aroma
the
more
it
warmed
up
the
better
it
tasted
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
unibroue
very
complex
in
flavor
the
alcohol
is
subtlely
disguised
this
beer
can
kick
ass
horrible
very
sweet
with
too
much
alcohol
shining
through
gag
gag
gag
horrible
unbalanced
and
syrupy
one
of
unibroues
worst
beers
no
doubt
get
maudite
or
trois
pistoles
instead
this
is
junk
69
first
off
this
is
an
oustanding
beer
it
is
clear
that
the
masters
at
unibroue
are
true
artisans
golden
yellow
slightly
hazy
with
a
beautiful
white
foamy
head
that
thins
but
stays
through
the
glass
smells
of
spices
sweet
citrus
qumquats
and
orange
and
fresh
baked
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
as
it
seems
to
impact
just
about
every
tastebud
carbonation
is
perfect
not
too
much
not
too
little
slightly
sweet
orange
and
rind
taste
a
touch
of
honey
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
finish
what
a
treat
another
excellent
unibroue
offering
very
noticable
yeast
smell
and
taste
smooth
and
should
be
drunk
slowly
very
high
abv
the
u
s
importer
in
unibrew
usa
caveat
i
generally
like
to
pour
the
yeast
sediment
directly
into
the
glass
to
add
to
the
flavor
of
most
beers
ddd
is
the
exception
i
would
recommend
decanting
this
as
the
yeast
seems
to
muddyup
the
spicyness
of
the
beer
either
way
however
you
are
in
for
a
treat
wow
i
had
read
a
lot
of
the
reviews
for
this
brew
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
the
expectations
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
about
12
in
thick
and
then
even
more
slowly
goes
to
a
nice
retaining
lace
the
smell
is
very
fruity
and
complex
due
to
my
winter
long
stuffed
nose
i
wasnt
able
to
fully
interpret
it
the
taste
is
wonderful
creaminess
dominates
throughout
with
traces
of
fruit
bananas
biscuits
and
subtle
spices
it
finishes
very
crisp
smooth
creaminess
is
what
the
mouthfeel
is
all
about
with
the
perfect
carbonation
not
too
intrusive
but
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
is
there
and
to
enhance
the
taste
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
its
9
0
abv
another
amazing
beer
from
unibroue
currently
my
favorite
of
theirs
although
my
favorite
seems
to
be
whatever
is
in
my
glass
at
the
time
not
as
complex
as
unibroues
dubbels
and
tripels
but
an
outstanding
beer
have
one
with
the
meal
then
one
for
dessert
and
it
makes
for
the
perfect
warm
culinary
experience
definitely
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
cloudy
golden
color
medium
head
fruity
sweet
malty
aroma
sweet
malty
buttery
spicy
citrus
taste
its
fairly
effervescent
with
a
spicy
finish
alcohol
is
well
balanced
a
pleasure
to
drink
down
to
the
last
drop
notes
at
9
abv
this
beer
is
suprisingly
light
and
refreshing
its
also
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
tasted
in
my
mind
this
is
not
a
strong
belgian
golden
ale
a
la
duvel
nor
is
it
a
tripel
its
a
pumpedup
wit
a
very
very
good
pumpedup
wit
mind
you
this
ale
is
to
blanche
de
chambly
unibroues
wit
as
de
koninck
grand
cru
is
to
regular
de
koninck
i
e
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
not
guzzled
i
believe
hoegaarden
has
a
grand
cru
version
of
their
wit
but
ive
never
tried
it
i
bet
theyre
similar
gratification
in
a
bottle
some
of
unibroues
finest
work
wow
curiously
fruity
in
that
i
could
not
put
a
name
to
the
fruit
notes
apricot
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
almost
dunked
my
nose
in
the
beer
trying
to
figure
it
out
9
alc
was
nicely
balanced
would
have
rated
it
higher
but
it
got
just
a
tad
too
sweet
at
the
finish
i
first
got
my
hands
on
this
brew
back
in
98
when
it
was
available
only
in
winter
sampler
packs
its
year
round
release
proves
me
one
thing
there
is
a
god
a
perfectly
balanced
9
brew
that
can
refresh
you
on
the
hottest
of
hot
summer
nights
tasty
finishes
with
a
dash
of
cinnamon
love
it
please
please
save
yourself
dont
drink
miller
lite
after
you
drink
this
beer
i
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
but
im
also
aware
that
its
not
heavily
hopforward
bitter
or
anything
else
some
like
in
their
pale
ales
even
stronger
ones
aroma
is
yeast
malt
hop
and
a
little
spice
appearance
has
a
small
but
longlasting
offwhite
head
some
lacing
and
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
flavor
is
like
aroma
plus
has
some
malt
and
fruit
sweetness
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
but
there
are
some
medicinal
qualities
to
the
aftertaste
body
is
good
with
just
a
touch
softness
overall
its
pretty
good
beer
except
for
that
medicinal
thing
nice
yeasty
floral
aroma
rich
golden
color
with
small
soapy
head
taste
come
sin
with
malt
yeast
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
acidity
some
wine
like
aroma
and
taste
to
this
o
a
very
flavorful
balanced
and
authentic
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ale
i
have
no
clue
why
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
one
overall
a
very
solid
belgianstyle
golden
that
is
a
bit
too
spicy
and
boozy
for
its
own
good
some
age
could
probably
mellow
this
one
out
and
hopefully
bring
out
some
of
the
more
subtle
fruit
notes
lurking
below
the
surface
of
the
more
assertive
characters
in
this
beer
overall
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
more
times
than
i
can
count
on
tap
or
bottled
its
always
a
favorite
never
disappointed
accurate
as
a
belgian
golden
but
never
boring
for
the
palate
i
now
equate
salvation
with
salivation
thank
you
avery
its
too
sweet
without
depth
o
no
where
near
belgian
enough
i
have
had
had
homebrew
better
than
this
avoid
this
pours
a
semicloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
containing
floaties
the
aroma
is
inviting
with
a
mixture
of
banana
and
yeast
the
taste
is
smooth
with
citrus
and
bready
tones
the
characteristics
are
very
true
to
the
belgian
style
this
is
interesting
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
youre
around
it
overall
a
good
take
on
the
style
but
seemed
to
be
a
tad
sweeter
than
most
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
grab
another
anytime
o
not
the
biggest
fan
of
gold
ales
but
this
is
very
good
for
the
style
highly
suggested
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
o
great
beer
im
glad
i
popped
this
at
10am
a
great
start
to
the
day
this
beer
is
super
sweet
i
am
just
not
sure
what
else
to
say
besides
that
it
is
not
pleasant
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
intense
there
are
nice
fruity
notes
from
the
yeast
which
i
really
like
the
malt
is
semisweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
sugar
which
i
also
like
but
unfortunately
the
alcohol
is
heavy
enough
to
mask
some
of
the
finer
nuances
an
overall
solid
beer
but
one
that
may
need
cellared
before
it
reaches
its
prime
overall
i
finished
it
but
it
didnt
seem
worth
finishing
too
alcoholic
even
at
9
brought
in
pint
glass
by
server
at
pizza
joint
good
sign
they
had
avery
in
al
a
golden

cloudy
with
thin

some
banana

slight

with

wife
loves
it
mf
light

sharp

feel
from
good
carbonation
with
a

o
this
is
pretty
solid
and
for
8
this
is
a
decent
buy
ill
get
it
again
for
buddies
who
are
entering
the
belgian
realm
the
taste
has
more
depth
than
the
aroma
with
many
of
the
same
characters
and
a
kind
of
licorice
flavor
in
the
background
to
boot
low
to
moderate
bitterness
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
salvation
to
my
knowledge
is
only
seen
rarely
here
in
sepa
so
a
chance
to
bag
it
was
a
big
goal
and
to
my
satasfaction
was
worthy
overall
a
pretty
decent
belgian
golden
strong
with
a
good
deal
of
breadiness
not
too
much
sweetness
and
a
fairly
nice
creamy
feel
one
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
o
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
looks
nice
has
a
vibrant
smell
and
tastes
like
it
should
o
very
authentic
belgian
taste
with
a
heavy
alcohol
bite
and
a
bottle
that
looks
like
something
from
a
medieval
art
history
class
really
enoying
this
one
a
little
tart
a
little
thin
but
overall
a
great
brew
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
not
that
hiding
it
is
the
goal
but
that
it
is
behind
some
of
the
other
flavors
and
not
prevalent
overall
a
solid
version
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
has
a
good
mix
of
fruit
esters
id
say
a
must
for
any
belgian
golden
ale
lover
overall
middle
of
the
road
not
smooth
enough
to
rate
as
top
off
class
belgian
strong
ale
a
good
warmer
though
smell
was
unique
in
a
good
way
too
thick
and
biscuity
for
my
taste
pours
dirty
golden
with
a
white
head
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
the
belgian
yeast
floral
banana
and
spices
also
present
is
some
lemon
the
yeast
is
way
too
strong
in
this
one
for
me
i
did
not
like
it
an
active
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
balanced
brew
for
me
less
yeast
please
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
complex
taste
of
this
beer
although
this
is
a
beer
that
you
need
to
slowly
sip
the
alcohol
isnt
too
noticeable
in
the
taste
o
this
is
a
sick
beer
im
glad
i
scored
it
its
not
very
complex
but
it
is
delicious
its
just
yeasty
and
alcoholic
enough
to
make
the
citrus
flavour
delicious
despite
the
strength
it
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
if
its
nighttime
its
not
much
fun
in
the
winter
though
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
avery
salvation
golden
ale
is
sure
worth
a
try
i
am
glad
i
did
othis
beer
is
not
bad
by
any
means
the
slight
off
flavor
i
mentioned
is
very
slight
but
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
perhaps
in
a
beer
style
such
as
this
one
in
which
there
are
hundreds
of
great
beers
salvation
just
did
not
stack
up
very
nice
sipper
of
a
beer
definitely
a
sipper
i
was
nervous
when
i
read
on
the
side
that
it
had
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
was
glad
when
i
didnt
detect
it
not
a
huge
fan
however
i
wish
they
would
have
masked
the
alcohol
better
and
i
wish
the
smell
wasnt
so
overpowered
from
the
apricot
eh
there
has
to
be
a
better
representation
of
this
style
overall
while
this
is
not
as
complex
as
some
other
belgianstyle
pale
ales
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
would
make
the
perfect
gateway
for
a
coors
light
drinkin
buddy
while
it
will
not
offend
anyone
it
is
full
of
flavor

it

here
in

it

dusty
ill
definately
try
this
one
again
sometime
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
here
ablebodied
effervescent
its
a
bit
hot
with
alcohol
is
its
only
detriment
but
overall
this
is
an
offthemark
belowaverage
attempt
at
a
style
that
not
many
american
brewers
get
right
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
it
was
pleasant
but
nothing
really
stood
out
but
i
liked
it
o
overall
im
disappointed
with
this
avery
offering
very
unfortunate
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
some
very
peach
and
apricot
like
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
distinct
peach
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
especially
like
the
peach
flavor
i
am
getting
out
of
this
one
3
5
d
not
a
bad
beer
its
missing
the
complexity
and
complementarity
of
flavors
that
the
best
belgians
have
but
its
entirely
drinkable
pours
out
a
light
golden
color
with
a
trace
of
copper
around
the
edges
and
with
a
somewhat
better
than
average
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
indeed
very
apricotlike
but
also
contains
light
cinnamon
clove
coriander
and
a
bit
of
banana
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
peachy
up
front
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
thrown
in
as
well
for
good
measure
gets
a
bit
alcoholic
and
solventy
in
the
finish
but
only
by
a
tiny
amount
which
is
acceptable
in
my
book
body
is
somewhat
too
thick
for
my
tastes
however
and
also
somewhat
too
lightly
carbonated
but
other
than
these
minor
issues
it
is
a
worthwhile
brew
o
well
done
a
little
high
on
residual
sugars
but
plenty
of
complexity
and
flavor
definitely
would
have
over
and
over
again
thanks
to
all
at
avery
for
a
great
beer
overall
a
very
nice
american
take
on
the
style
thats
dangerously
drinkable
saddens
me
the
only
place
i
found
this
was
boardman

vintage
estates
great
beer
this
beer
has
a
slightly
sweet
flowery
taste
bitterness
lingers
after
interesting
to
compare
this
with
unibroue
don
de
dieu
which
is
in
the
same
style
much
less
heavily
flavored
even
though
its
brewed

this

is
a
wonderful
offering
from
the
avery
brewery
just
like
the
new
belgium

co
aka
flat
tire
to
most
avery
has
delivered
an
authentic

that
is
impressive

most
important

o
very
pleasing
considering

i
love
belgian

beers
for
an

the
avery

fits
the
bill
perfectly
using

the
salvation
radiates
deep
amber
with
a
hint
of
ruby
color
resting
comfortably
on

is
an
ample

that
lasts
to
the
finish
you
expect
that
wonderful
aroma
of
yeast
and
bready
notes
from
a
belgian
style
and
this
avery
brew
delivers
in
abundance
but
the
best
is
yet
to
come
very
smooth
going
down
the
salvation
has
a
wide
array
of
flavorful
notes
from
apricot
and
pear
to
hints
of
cinnamon
and
alspice
i
greatly
enjoyed
experiencing
salvation
bomber
size
signature
brews
are
expensive
but
at
times
are
good
but
not
outstanding
the
avery
product
clears
the
bar
it
could
be
better
but
i
wouldnt
doubt
this
is
because
the
bottles
been
on
the
shelf
a
little
too
long
through
the
oxidation
however
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
ill
revisit
this
one
when
avery
decides
to
distribute
in
arizona
again

d
nice
some
fascinating
well
behaved
complexity
overall
not
an
undrinkable
beer
but
also
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
doesnt
have
enough
carbonation
and
feels
way
too
heavy
to
be
within
the
belgian
style
the
taste
is
fine
but
its
not
complex
at
all
and
seems
to
have
some
adjunct
qualities
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
o
overly
sweet
phenolic
and
messy
flavors
overall
would
pair
very
well
with
food
overall
will
definitely
be
a
steady
in
the
fridge
avery
brewing
co
might
be
one
of
the
biggest
sleepers
in
the
microbrewery
business
but
not
a
sleeper
to
me
well
crafted
beer
and
that
pretty
damn
good
i
hope
you
all
enjoy
cheers
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
one
on
tap
to
see
if
my
suspicions
were
unfounded
and
to
see
how
it
performs
in
a
bar
atmosphere
against
others
like
it
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
color
with
a
large
creamy
ivory
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
have
a
large
candy
sweetness
with
some
citrus
and
peach
fruitiness
the
spices
come
through
and
add
some
pop
to
the
fruity
flavors
there
is
also
a
decent
level
of
bitterness
that
is
works
well
with
everything
else
going
on
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
o
a
solid
stab
at
a
classic
belgium
style
from
the
avery
team
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
o
a
solid
entry
from
the
always
diverse
avery
canon
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
feeling
up
for
a
belgian
with
an
american
twist
a
really
great
thirstquencher
too
oanother
great
brew
from
the

avery
notes
after
the
old
disappointments
in

of
ales
reverend
mild
disappointment
hogs
fly
badly
remembered
this
is
a
much
welcome
and
delayed
surprise
i
probably
need
to
revisit
those
two
just
in
case
this
was
a
much
recommended
brew
from
those
lost
floridian
folks
i
met
in
atlanta
thanks
and
indeed
well
worth
the
try
not
only
it
stirs
away
a
bit
from
some
astringencydryness
i
am
not
particular
fond
of
in
most
golden
ales
my
bad
but
the
fruitiness
and
rounded
sweetness
while
not
extraordinary
actually
works
very
well
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
either
wow
buttery
colored
and
fluffy
headed
salvation
looks
tempting
smells
of
butterscotch
and
over
ripe
peaches
also
that
classic
belgian
yeast
tastes
a
bit
fruity
again
the
peaches
and
there
is
a
unique
sweetness
that
works
well
here
it
could
be
more
carbonated
which
would
give
it
a
lighterbrighter
feeling
in
the
mouth
but
the
lack
of
super
carbonation
makes
the
flavors
stand
out
distinctly
this
is
a
fantastic
series
of
beers
from
avery
and
along
with
the
reverend
are
in
my
opion
the
two
best
brews
they
make
really
different
for
a
belgian
pale
overall
i
like
this
one
as
far
as
tastes
but
the
smell
kind
of
had
a
funky
bitter
orange
that
i
didnt
like
to
much
i
love
this
ale
otherwise
and
wish
it
was
available
in
12oz
bottles
overall
as
always
an
enjoyable
beer
from
avery
90
good
all
around
id
like
to
have
this
after
it
cellared
for
a
while
simply
a
solid
belgian
overall
nice
bold
flavors
the
22
oz
bottle
went
pretty
quickly
considering
that
im
not
feeling
quite
100
on
a
morning
following
gabf
11
overall
i
wasnt
that
impressed
by
this
one
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
unfortunately
for
the
avery
brewing
co
i
personally
found
this
beer
to
be
very
fruity
with
tastes
of
dried
apricots
with
nutmeg
and
or
cinnamon
which
brings
me
to
the
question
wheres
the
hops
the
pour
was
a
disappointment
do
to
the
inability
to
produce
or
even
maintain
a
head
im
not
wanting
to
bash
this
beer
because
you
can
tell
from
the
bottling
color
artwork
on
the
label
which
is
amazing
by
the
way
speaking
of
the
color
i
think
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
love
this
beer
due
to
the
color
maybe
why
i
was
disappointed
all
that
being
said
if
you
like
a
fruity
tasting
beer
this
ones
for
you
get
out
and
try
it
pours
a
deep
yellowgolden
color
with
a
fizzing
quick
fading
1
finger
head
that
leaves
nothing
behind
pretty
good
pour
smells
of
bananas
fig
orange
and
plenty
of
euro
yeast
not
overpowering
but
smells
nice
taste
is
really
smooth
and
enjoyable
lots
of
fruits
hit
the
palate
with
a
somewhat
hoppy
finish
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
t
candi
sugar
slightly
bready
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
while
the
alcohol
flavor
is
present
its
nicely
subdued
overall
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
solid
easy
to
find
year
round
brew
with
a
good
price
point
hmm
not
awful
but
kind
of
a
miss
for
me
a
hybrid
of
styles
saisonbspatriple
in
that
order
and
it
seems
unfocused
i
could
not
wait
to
get
through
my
glass
the
salvation
started
out
so
well
for
me
but
then
got
worse
as
the
beer
went
down
id
still
probably
give
it
another
try
o
nice
and
balanced
but
a
little
more
bitterness
compared
to
the
belgians
ive
had
earlier
in
this
style
overall
very
nice
aroma
the
taste
at
first
was
more
sour
than
i
like
but
after
a
few
sips
it
became
more
drinkable
d
very
complex
with
intense
yeast
character
kind
if
thick
for
the
style
and
perhaps
a
bit
less
drinkable
because
of
that
but
still
a
nice
beer
well
i
would
say
belgian
ipa
here
the
hops
are
dominant
over
the
yeast
and
malt
overall
there
are
so
many
other
comparably
priced
belgian
style
ales
that
i
prefer
unibroue
im
looking
at
you
so
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
i
guess
part
of
it
is
that
from
the
color
description
and
abv
i
keep
wanting
it
to
be
a
tripel
which
it
isnt
nor
does
it
claim
to
be
ultimately
hoppier
than
id
have
liked
d
not
bad
for
pulling
it
off
the
bottom
shelf
at
the
liquor
store
poured
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
some
haze
to
it
the
head
on
the
beer
was
big
white
and
thick
looking
the
smell
was
yeasty
and
had
a
touch
of
spices
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
reflects
those
same
aspects
the
spicy
notes
come
through
in
the
aftertaste
and
leave
a
light
warming
sensation
i
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thicker
side
not
too
bad
overall
its
not
the
best
belgian
strong
ale
but
its
probably
worth
a
try
peace
out
avery
the
beer
is
an
opaque
golden
orange
with
pillowy
white
head
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
of
banana
candisugar
lemon
and
yeast
the
taste
is
kind
of
funky
i
could
taste
banana
yeast
clove
and
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
soft
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
nothing
too
special
though
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
and
leaves
little
lacing
or
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
with
floral
notes
and
sweet
malty
notes
the
taste
starts
with
some
floral
and
earthy
hops
and
then
becomes
sweet
with
bready
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
balanced
and
finishes
smooth
overall
a
good
belgian
ale
drinkabilityoverall
its
drinkable
and
the
balance
is
very
nice
in
making
this
beer
not
becoming
to
sweet
or
to
dry
its
alot
lighter
then
i
expected
both
by
smell
style
its
a
good
beer
falls
just
short
of
being
great
but
for
5
49
def
good
value
and
a
buy
overall
pretty
good
typical
but
nice
belgian
golden
malts
fruits
candi
sugar
just
a
hint
of
hops
a
bit
boozy
and
the
sweetness
and
little
syrupy
feel
are
a
bit
much
not
as
nice
as
the
reverend
im
not
as
into
the
belgian
pales
so
maybe
thats
the
reason
but
worth
a
try
o
nice
one
still
not
as
good
as
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pales
but
still
one
to
add
to
the
roster
would
buy
again
easily
o
wasnt
a
fan
if
it
had
tasted
like
the
aroma
that
would
have
been
fine
even
though
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
hops
slightly
but
drank
a
little
of
it
and
then
poured
it
something
i
rarely
do
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
really
love
it
this
beer
is
an
interesting
nontraditional
belgianstyle
ale
its
of
course
a
clear
golden
color
modest
head
for
the
style
the
smell
is
unique
earthy
musty
hoppy
alcoholic
and
very
fruity
apple
pear
peach
and
spice
the
spice
note
comes
out
more
through
the
beer
along
with
the
earthiness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
more
sweet
than
expected
hoppy
warm
and
peppery
the
finish
is
quite
sweet
good
solid
body
nice
beer
o
i
have
enjoyed
most
of
the
things
avery
has
brewed
and
i
was
very
tempted
to
try
this
as
well
it
is
maltier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
it
is
heavier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
as
well
i
understand
that
belgianstyle
golden
ales
tend
to
be
on
the
heavier
side
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
balance
from
hops
the
beer
is
fruity
mostly
pear
with
honey
and
on
the
sweeter
side
the
alcohol
is
fairly
strong
on
the
finish
and
evident
in
the
warmth
that
sits
in
the
throat
salvation
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
have
been
better
balanced
22oz
bottle
pours
clear
dark
goldenalmost
orange
color
with
white
head
nice
carbonation
aroma
has
lots
of
ripe
pit
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
citrusy
guava
the
fruit
really
dominates
the
nose
but
its
very
pleasant
taste
is
sweet
malt
backbone
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
some
hop
bitterness
the
ripe
fruits
peek
out
from
the
bitterness
to
balance
this
out
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
sticky
texture
but
not
as
much
as
many
other
avery
beers
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
pleasant
this
might
be
my
favorite
avery
beer
in
their
regular
lineup
figures
they
are
leaving
az
now
oh
well
i
can
wait
a
year
or
so
til
they
come
back
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
pale
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
and
ultimately
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
for
being
as
strong
as
it
is
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
know
what
it
is
about
the
finish
that
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
if
it
were
more
hoppy
or
more
sweet
i
probably
wouldnt
care
for
either
so
i
guess
that
makes
it
just
right
i
guess
if
it
were
a
bit
drier
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
it
may
come
across
more
convincingly
perhaps
he
isnt
using
adjuncts
which
is
admirable
but
maybe
a
little
would
help
dry
this
beer
out
a
bit
and
make
it
a
little
cleaner
in
the
finish
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
was
but
i
think
some
aging
might
be
best
for
it
definitely
an
above
average
beer
just
not
one
of
averys
best
overall
its
decent
but
not
fantastic
jd
o
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
from
avery
that
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
though
i
would
have
liked
more
fruit
would
have
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
very
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
glad
i
bought
2
i
can
see
how
this
ages
grade
purchased
at

99
ea
there
are
some
really
great
examples
of
this
and
this
is
really
good
although
i
dont
know
if
it
measures
up
to
say
a
duvel
bright
orangeyellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
brief
short
white
head
that
didnt

spice
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
tangy
carbonation
tangy
apricot
and
citrus
flavors
in
the
front
followed
by
a
floral
hoppy
and
spicy
middle
finished
with
a
hoppy
citrus
and
light
pine
character
a
long
lingering
yeasty
biscuity
belgian
aftertaste
the
alcoholic
heat
peaks
through
every
once
in
a
while
but
isnt
prominent
definitey
a
sipper
and
very
enjoyabe
o
a
good
quality
beer
that
fits
to
the
style
very
balanced
and
a
great
sipper
i
approve
of
this
beer
as
a
lover
of
belgians
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
different
and
it
drinks
extremely
easily
the
abv
is
somewhat
high
so
the
alcohol
peeking
through
is
understandable
a
winner
from
avery
my
curiosity
for
both
salvation
beers
arose
after
i
tried
collaboration
not
litigation
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
both
salvations
much
more
then
col
not
lit
i
look
forward
to
having
another
one
of
these
overall
seems
like
a
bastardized
weissbier
that
is
a
little
too
sweet
interesting
enough
but
doesnt
seem
at
home
in
the
bspa
category
o
a
decent
bspa
worth
having
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
elite
example
of
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
strong
but
welldisguised
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
stronger
belgian
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
this
is
a
bastardized
version
of
its
style
the
malty
sweetness
is
overdone
while
again
the
yeastiness
is
hardly
noticeable
is
it
terrible
no
will
i
be
drinking
it
again
no
overall
sometimes
things
are
better
the
second
time
around
first
time
i
had
this
one
was
at
a
bar
after
a
few
other
beers
i
didnt
think
salvation
was
anything
special
probably
since
the
flavors
are
so
delicate
that
any
beers
before
mask
them
definitely
a
heavenly
experience
vegetal
overall
with
a
lemon
pledge
nose
and
edamame
taste
cheap
alcohol
burn
i
would
highly
recommend
this
perhaps
as
my
third
favorite
avery
beer
and
thats
hard
to
say
decent
medium
body
high
carbonation
but
a
bit
creamy
and
dry
drinks
nice
although
it
was
a
little
hot
and
not
particularly
memorable
compared
to
other
belgian
styled
ales
i
was
worried
about
this
beer
being
a
sinful
bastard
but
it
was
most
assuredly
a
fine
beer
that
hides
its
abv
well
and
is
delivers
a
tasty
and
heavenly
drinking
experience
i
just
dont
know
if
ill
ever
buy
this
over
duvel
d
not
bad
but
not
very
good
considering
the
price
d
not
bad
but
i
would
still
take
duvel
for
the
money
for
its
crispness
this
one
is
a
sipper
with
a
thick
slick
feel
and
a
nice
spicy
fruity
flavor
good
but
i
like
collaboration
not
litigation
ale
a
lot
more
cheers
the
citrus
tartness
cuts
out
the
sweetness
good
creamy
characters
alcohol
is
hidden
well
a
solid
drinker
nice
pleasant
beer
from
avery
good
yeast
contribution
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
beer
has
aged
with
grace
and
went
down
way
too
fast
still
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
d
i
could
literally
do
this
all
day
and
in
fact
ive
done
it
before
with
belgian
counterparts
of
the
same
ilk
smooth
strong
complex
and
refreshing
other
than
some
moules
frites
to
line
the
stomach
what
more
could
anyone
need
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
almost
no
lacing
nose
brings
candied
sugar
caramel
dark
fruits
hints
of
spice
and
some
booze
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
flavors
in
all
directions
and
the
malt
and
the
yeast
never
really
coming
together
and
then
being
overwhelmed
by
a
big
booziness
the
feel
brings
a
slight
creaminess
that
is
somewhat
appetizing
and
is
a
boost
over
the
nose
drinkability
is
fairly
poor
definitely
prefer
the
other
end
of
the
collaboration
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
in
dedham
served
in
a
10
oz
stemmed
tulip
glass
hazy
pumpkin
orange
color
with
not
much
head
smell
had
a
really
nice
spicy
aroma
to
it
like
coriander
and
cardamon
taste
was
very
pleasant
strong
belgian
flavors
such
as
candied
sugar
and
and
tart
fruit
like
apples
and
pears
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
but
the
high
abv
seemed
a
bit
hot
on
the
palate
drinkability
was
fine
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
but
the
10
oz
glass
seemed
appropriate
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
a
nice
beer
to
savor
for
a
while
as
it
warms
up
a
fairly
clean
pour
it
has
a
little
hazy
cloudiness
but
not
much
the
color
is
a
very
rich
yellow
gold
the
head
is
thin
but
laces
well
a
huge
malty
banana
nose
jumps
out
of
the
glass
the
banana
carries
over
to
the
tongue
but
not
getting
any
other
spices
without
more
fruits
or
spice
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
belgian
style
but
still
a
good
beer
some
alcohol
heat
is
present
but
thin
it
smoothes
out
to
a
creamy
malt
great
mouthfeel
it
covers
every
crevice
of
your
mouth
causing
a
long
lingering
finish
its
not
so
rich
you
cant
drink
this
one
easily
but
with
the
alcohol
feeling
it
makes
me
wonder
how
much
you
would
want
to
d
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
with
a
sort
of
half
hearted
spice
character
a
bit
boozy
too
overall
i
give
this
a
6
out
of
10
i
wont
pursue
this
much
since
its
cousin
collaboration
not
litigation
is
far
more
interesting
to
me
and
more
substantial
this
feels
like
its
weaker
dumber
brother
still
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
is
not
great
either
not
overly
inviting
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
the
sweetness
overpowering
i
have
had
avery
salvation
before
but
it
was
in
collaboration
with
russian
rivers
version
so
i
have
not
had
it
by
itself
yet
salvation
is
a
orange
hued
golden
pale
ale
with
a
tuft
of
foam
that
releases
orange
and
lemon
oil
aromas
a
hint
of
pepper
and
clove
and
a
yeasty
earthiness
the
beer
had
a
lingering
sweetness
that
was
perhaps
due
to
the
low
carbonation
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
suffered
for
it
overall
not
the
best
but
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
fruity
aroma
flavor
is
apricot
yeast
citrus
slight
clove
pears
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
until
you
finish
the
22oz
bomber
than
you
feel
it
a
decent
belgian
golden
ale
but
nothing
special
i
have
had
better
d
at
9
it
doesnt
really
show
it
probably
great
if
you
love
the
style
but
i
didnt
dig
it
at
all
not
bland
but
flat
and
boring
in
my
opinion
sorry
if
im
missing
something
d
good
overall
average
beer
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
night
this
is
probably
my
favorite
local
duvel
sort
of
beer
its
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
sturdy
white
head
held
up
by
plenty
of
carbonation
the
flavor
and
scent
have
a
big
belgian
fruitiness
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
body
is
nice
and
light
delicious
while
avery
does
some
excellent
beers
i
fail
to
be
impressed
by
their
belgianstyle
ales
with
this
one
i
feel
an
eventual
drainpour
coming
on
something
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
here
i
noticed
the
the
style
says
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
my
bottle
says
golden
ale
and
this
is
not
what
i
expect
for
a
strong
pale
ale
but
the
label
shown
matches
my
bottle
i
hope
i
put
this
review
in
the
proper
spot
here
the
ornate
busy
and
artful
label
design
is
fitting
for
this
opaque
golden
ale
with
a
brisk
9
abv
content
the
taste
is
rich
malty
and
sweet
with
floral
fruity
overtones
and
a
hopedged
finish
a
complex
flavor
thats
pleasing
and
surprisingly
palatable
superb
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
pleasant
rocky
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
orange
blossom
honey
light
citrus
and
belgian
spice
this
one
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
goes
down
way
to
easily
for
its
abv
i
get
flavors
of
pears
dark
candi
sugar
and
maybe
white
pepper
very
good
and
always
welcomed
great
overall
beer
im
glad
i
finally
decided
to
pick
this
one
up
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
bspa
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
very
complex
for
the
style
a
very
good
offering
from
avery
ill
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
the
6
price
tag
isnt
too
bad
for
9
and
great
taste
md
drinkable
at
a
slow
pace
the
big
bottle
a
t
9
has
a
kick
drinks
nicely
d
really
good
i
could
easily
enjoy
multiple
rounds
of
these
exceptionally
enjoyable
d
not
a
style
that
i
am
especially
knowledgeable
about
but
i
found
the
salvation
to
be
yet
another
very
solid
offering
from
avery
well
rounded
flavors
with
a
nice
integration
of
the
abv
not
to
mention
a
great
yeast
strain
good
stuff
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
great
beer
d
the
great
dry
fruity
beer
is
stomped
on
by
hop
bitterness
with
some
notes
of
old
spices
in
their
there
wasnt
even
much
hop
flavor
or
aroma
just
the
bitter
bite
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
the
aroma
had
an
initial
blast
of
sulfur
but
that
blew
off
quickly
leaving
a
grainy
rather
wheaty
in
fact
character
with
some
gentle
fruit
like
apricot
and
a
hefty
dose
of
allspice
the
flavor
follows
along
with
a
strong
wheatlike
character
giving
it
a
bready
note
with
light
spiced
fruit
apricot
pear
white
nectarine
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
there
is
a
found
overripe
sourness
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
strength
at
least
is
relatively
well
balanced
very
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
lot
of
physical
substance
to
the
brew
and
the
alcohol
burn
is
not
very
well
disguised
by
all
means
not
an
extreme
american
deal
perhaps
a
bit
stronger
than
the
usual
for
the
style
but
definetly
a
return
to
good
old
hearty
delicate
blends
good
beer
quite
good
especially
for
the
price
very
belgian
and
holds
true
to
style
although
far
from
my
favorite
avery
bomber
but
definately
a
worthy
brew
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
real
pleasant
beer
that
despite
it
being
slightly
different
than
the
traditional
style
it
is
given
is
a
real
fun
drink
as
i
try
more
of
what
avery
has
to
offer
it
has
yet
to
let
me
down
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
this
beer
is
definitely
too
pungent
and
not
dry
enough
to
fit
into
my
category
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
said
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
i
guess
i
had
only
tired
the
collaboration
version
as
well
as
russian
rivers
version
this
is
very
good
i
would
consider
it
a
strong
blond
rather
than
a
strong
pale
but
it
had
great
flavor
whose
alcohol
is
well
hidden
good
carbonation
and
something
ill
drink
many
times
again
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
thats
remarkably
quaffable
for
9
abv
it
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
mild
graininess
that
gives
way
to
vaguely
tropical
yeast
and
hop
flavors
it
has
a
nice
long
lightly
bitter
finish
this
beer
should
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
of
drinkers
go
avery
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
airy
offwhite
head
which
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
ton
of
spots
and
streaks
of
sticky
lace
behind
smells
malty
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
little
spice
in
the
end
tastes
a
bit
grainy
with
a
big
fruit
hit
in
the
middle
some
big
hops
toward
the
end
and
a
few
slight
phenolic
notes
lingering
in
the
background
further
exploration
reveals
some
cotton
candy
sweetness
which
works
into
the
mix
quite
well
alcohol
is
wellhidden
at
first
but
becomes
more
apparent
the
beer
warms
but
never
to
the
point
that
it
is
overwhelming
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
pours
a
clear
goldenc
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt

slight

and
slight
citrus

the
style
of
a
belgian
strong

feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol

and
slight
earthy
malt
overall
good
blent
aroma
body
and
complexity
the
body
may
have
been
just
a
little
fuller
than
i
find
is
usual
for
this
style
even
at
the
9
abv
mark
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
your
time
above
average
example
of
the
style
aroma
is
dominated
by
belgian
yeast
citrus
peels
and
coriander
this
beer
has
too
much
coriander
for
me
too
much
spice
the
hops
give
salvation
an
earthy
herbal
profile
and
it
meshes
well
with
the
big
yeast
backing
tastes
notes
are
honey
apricot
overripe
banana
coriander
belgian
yeast
and
light
candi
sugar
probably
too
much
candi
sugar
overall
a
good
beer
but
still
far
from
the
best
examples
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
sweet
honey
and
sour
yeast
with
some
floral
hops
and
hazel
nut
it
tasted
like
apricot
and
lemon
and
orange
hops
with
sweet
honey
malt
and
sour
yeast
with
some
spicy
wheat
and
alcohol
accents
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
and
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
nice
smell
and
taste
with
lots
of
hops
almost
like
a
belgian
ipa
but
still
very
well
balanced
it
had
good
body
too
but
the
noticeable
alcohol
makes
this
more
of
a
sipping
beer
quite
an
enjoyable
drink
and
recommended

i
couldnt
find
a
whole
lot
here
when
cold
so
i
let
it
warm
and
characteristics
in
the
beer
really
became
easier
to
identify
i
definitely
started
to
drinking
this
beer
when
it
was
too
cold
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
that
adds
to
this
beer
with
a
definite
dryness
that
i
was
looking
for
in
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slightly
syrupy
and
the
alcohol
is
present
but
at
9
abv
well
hidden
overall
a
solid
beer
recommended
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
1
inch
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
appearance
is
golden
amber
and
slightly
cloudy
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
cloves
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
malt
sweetness
fruitiness
and
cloves
coming
in
toward
the
end
the
feel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ale
that
ill
be
returning
to
but
i
cant
see
myself
knocking
these
back
all
evening
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
a
very
good
though
not
great
beer
for
the
style
well
worth
a
shot
peachy
yellow
thin
fizzy
head
not
much
lacing
but
still
some
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
yeasty
with
a
clove
spiciness
light
fruits
mostly
peach
and
pear
taste
is
yeasty
up
front
peppery
spiced
in
the
finish
some
pear
and
white
grape
taste
follows
the
nose
the
spicy
bite
is
nice
to
balance
everything
out
it
is
a
bit
hot
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
where
i
was
hoping
for
a
dryer
finish
in
this
one
overall
this
beer
is
a
must
try
probably
not
the
best
example
of
bspa
but
def
a
standard
fare
notes
avery
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
was
a
hit
i
recommend
this
for
any
belgian
style
fans
o
nothing
special
ive
had
much
better
from
avery
mouthfeel
is
a
decent
medium
but
i
think
bspas
should
be
big
and
full
not
creamy
enough
crisp
spicy
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
estery
light
fruit
notes
floral
hops
slightly
creamy
body
subtle
hops
and
alcohol
warmth
smooth
quaffable
and
pretty
drinkable
hints
of
peppery
spice
crisp
citrus
and
light
fruit
notes
im
picking
up
estery
apple
and
pear
with
some
orange
peel
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
md
better
than
most
belgian
goldens
ive
had
but
too
sweet
in
the
long
run
drinkability
is
excellent
for
this
style
of
beer
i
split
a
bomber
could
have
easily
drank
the
whole
thing
and
more
pours
a
deep
amber
with
dense
one
finger
white
head
leaves
a
nice
clump
and
lots
of
lace
smell
sweet
grainy
pale

vinous
graham
cracker

musty
and
grainy
spicy
dried

maybe
a

of
the
sip
white
nectarine
dry
active
carbonation
slightly
creamy
alcohol
hidden
in
the
sip
but
warming
better
than
expected
maybe
even
underrated
notes
of
dried
fruit
and
malt
are
noticeable
along
with
some
barley
there
is
a
definite
sweetness
in
the
aroma
tastes
of
caramel
and
alcohol
are
sensed
first
which
is
followed
by
some
light
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
mouthfeel
is
bready
and
creamy
and
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
robust
frothy
head
subtle
aromas
of
malt
and
grain
fill
the
nostrils
and
anticipation
builds
the
beer
beckons
to
be
savored
and
when
this
belgian
elixir
hits
the
tongue
there
are
tastes
of
orange
and
bready
malt
then
the
subsequent
alcohol
warming
effect
gives
itself
up
to
a
gradually
building
bitterness
that
lingers
well
past
the
swallow
the
carbonated
nature
of
the
beer
lends
itself
to
a
nice
mouth
coating
beer
is
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
sitting
an
extra
note
as
others
have
stated
try
sipping
this
as
it
warms
the
flavors
seem
to
balance
out
it
is
very
spicy
and
in
your
face
when
ice
cold
cheers
overall
still
learning
to
appreciate
the
style
avery
salvation
this
belgian
style
golden
ale
was
golden
in
color
with
a
luscious
apricot
and
peach
aroma
that
is
interwoven
with
suggestions
of
nutmeg
and
perhaps
cinnamon
the
apricot
and
cinnamon
in
i
raelly
loved
medium
body
with
a
soft
palate
and
sweet
finish
one
of
my
american
brewing
companies
d
a
very
wellcrafted
brew
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
fruity
spicy
herbal
complexity
id
pair
this
with
a
creamy
slightly
bitter
cows
milk
cheese
with
a
lightly
washedrind
or
with
a
fried
egg
for
breakfast
seriously
overall
this
is
a
great
bspa
which
is
quite
inexpensive
its
tasty
and
warming
d
excellent
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
in
both
the
sweet
and
bitter
stages
and
i
would
drink
again
if
i
was
given
the
opportunity
md
a
mouth
engolfing
mouthfeel
but
it
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
especially
with
the
nice
and
high
abv
satisfying
but
not
blow
your
socks
off
great
for
the
price
ill
probably
revisit
this
one
as
its
a
relatively
good
example
of
the
style
americanized
at
least
drinkability
pretty
good
for
the
style
there
was
a
sweet
alcohol
note
with
concord
grape
esters
and
ripe
bananas
it
was
very
well
balanced
between
alcohol
and
fruit
sweetness
with
rich
malt
flavor
great
price
value
at
5
99
for
the
22
oz
big
bottle
my
beer
was
bottled
less
than
three
months
ago
and
it
showed
based
on
the
livelyness
not
the
beer
wehn
i
first
poured
it
i
am
can
only
imagine
that
this
beer
will
imporve
with
age
was
expecting
a
bit
more
bitterness
true
to
the
style
but
not
really
what
i
was
hoping
for
decent
not
too
boozy
or
sweet
worth
a
shot
the
taste
and
feel
though
lack
it
tastes
like
what
it
is
but
a
thin
very
bland
subdued
form
it
is
spicey
and
raisiny
but
in
a
rather
bland
way
with
faint
hints
of
orange
and
juniper
plus
some
grain
mostly
just
in
the
finish
and
a
light
vague
fruitiness
everything
is
very
subdued
and
thin
except
for
alcoholic
bit
and
spice
it
has
a
somewhat
full
slightly
oily
feel
but
this
is
a
bit
thin
too
and
it
carries
no
real
character
with
it
d
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
solid
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shopt
not
the
most
remarkable
version
ive
tried
from
this
style
nor
one
of
the
more
remarkable
brews
ive
sampled
from
avery
this
one
is
fairly
forgettable
an
okay
room
temp
tripel
yet
still
rough
around
the
edges
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
really
high
this
is
a
wellpriced
supertasty
bspa
the
only
real
issue
is
the
abv
avery
has
got
a
real
winner
here
d
its
a
tasty
brew
but
not
the
greatest
overall
very
enjoyable
and
a
good
american
example
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
fluffy
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
belgian
yeast
aromas
smells
sweet
spicy
funky
and
tangy
good
malt
peppery
spice
buttery
richness
and
a
bunch
of
funky
yeast
flavor
the
only
thing
that
i
didnt
like
was
that
i
thought
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
was
a
little
too
strong
nothing
wrong
with
it
it
is
a
unique
take
just
not
my
taste
in
this
style
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
brew
for
its
type
enjoyable
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
sweet
and
spicy
cinnamonmalts
interesting
and
im
going
back
for
more
quite
a
beer
the
aging
of
this
bottle
is
key
i
think
dnot
really
overall
a
simple
belgian
pale
ale
but
wellexecuted
d
find
some
friends
who
like
golden
ales
its
a
lot
to
put
down
by
yourself
still
very
drinkable
d
easy
to
finish
but
not
sure
id
want
another
one
right
now
something
i
shouldnt
have
passed
by
so
many
times
without
trying
the
price
is
right
it
seems
to
be
a
very
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
style
not
bad
d
abv
alone
makes
it
a
nice
sipper
flavors
and
complexity
change
with
warming
so
take
your
time
nice
looking
in
my
snifter
has
a
somewhat
smaller
head
than
id
like
to
see
in
this
type
of
belgian
beer
the
smells
and
tastes
are
very
average
there
is
some
sweetness
and
sugar
notes
compounded
with
earthy
bitterness
none
of
the
smells
or
tastes
are
pronounced
however
if
you
search
you
can
pick
out
some
of
the
complexities
which
are
the
norm
for
the
style
but
i
think
you
shouldnt
have
to
search
if
the
beer
is
truly
great
it
stays
nice
and
carbonated
and
is
even
quite
refreshing
for
a
beer
with
this
much
alcohol
its
a
fine
beer
and
maybe
one
id
have
again
if
offered
but
its
not
my
favorite
avery
does
many
other
things
very
well
but
im
not
sure
this
is
one
of
them
just
an
average
belgian
style
pale
ale
d
not
one
i
would
purchase
again
d
will
not
have
this
again
a
very
unenjoyable
flavor
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
a
few
weeks
to
make
sure
i
get
a
different
batch
on
a
final
note
i
must
say
im
torn
over
this
one
i
liked
the
beer
but
didnt
think
it
fit
the
style
all
that
well
the
heavy
dose
of
grapefruit
in
the
middle
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
get
the
grapefruit
out
of
there
and
you
have
a
nice
belgian
with
it
there
its
a
bit
too
american
tastes
very
sweet
and
again
plenty
of
fruit
comes
off
as
too
sweet
leaving
a
sticky
near
cloying
feel
on
my
tongue
the
alcohol
warmth
on
the
end
attempts
to
balance
out
the
residual
sweetness
but
fails
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
limp
and
somewhat
lifeless
lacking
the
strong
push
of
tiny
bubbles
found
in
the
best
of
belgium
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
one
glass
the
color
is
a
honey
tone
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
laces
away
the
smell
is
metallic
a
tad
sugary
the
taste
is
sweet
not
too
overpowering
though
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
easy
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
solid
strong
pale
ale
and
proper
quality
for
the
price
md
light
bodied
with
some
low
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
evident
in
throughout
the
consumption
d
unbelievable
for
a
belgian
with
9abv
no
strange
flavors
a
beautiful
pale
wheat
color
like
a
late
summer
field
big
fluffy
cloud
like
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
like
a
belgian
a
little
barn
a
little
malt
and
lots
of
yeastyness
taste
follows
smell
the
carbonation
is
just
right
its
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
smooth
all
the
way
down
drinkability
is
the
shining
cross
of
this
beer
22oz
went
down
fast
and
i
could
drink
another
or
two
but
at
9
thats
a
bad
idea
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
think
pinot
grigio
herbal
slightly
medicinal
hoppy
but
not
overpoweringly
so
complex
doesnt
even
begin
to
describe
this
beer
each
sip
brings
a
new
flavor
nuance
to
the
forefront
im
very
pleased
d
the
savior
has
a
drinkable
complexity
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
due
to
its
mighty
strength
good
beer
for
a
pimp
cup
pours
a
slightly
fogged
orange
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
perfume
floral
tones
and
boozy
flavor
carries
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
tones
as
well
minor
dough
floral
tones
are
here
too
typical
belgian
ale
sweet
tones
feel
smooth
on
liquid
and
carbonation
east
to
drink
a
bit
too
hot
but
nice
enough
final
thought
a
nice
strong
ale
that
tastes
like
a
kicked
up
german
hefeweizen
very
good
stuff
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
nice
pours
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
aroma
is
spicy
and
grainy
heavy
flavor
lots
of
malt
yeast
and
spice
with
some
candied
fruit
you
can
definitely
taste
the
cinnamon
especially
as
the
beer
warms
borders
on
a
winter
ale
with
the
spice
avery
always
seems
to
come
through
the
aroma
is
complex
with
coriander
nutmeg
light
fruit
yeast
malt
and
alcohol
the
appearance
is
hazy
copper
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
the
flavor
is
complex
just
like
the
aroma
with
a
spicy
peppery
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
this
beer
could
be
from
several
of
the
best
breweries
of
belgium
and
no
one
would
even
know
its
an
american
maybe
i
should
say
any
of
the
best
brewers
of
belgium
are
close
to
the
quality
of
avery
average
for
the
style
and
with
the
abv
way
up
there
i
would
not
drink
much
of
this
so
many
better
examples
of
the
sytle
readily
available
leaves
this
one
on
the
store
shelf
from
now
on
it
has
a
bright
gold
colored
body
with
about
three
fingers
of
frothy
head
this
beer
pored
like
it
should
have
been
in
an
advertisement
it
has
a
spicy
sweet
and
mildly
sweet
aroma
it
has
true
belgian
style
taste
it
is
very
sweet
to
start
but
gets
gradually
bitter
as
you
go
it
almost
has
a
pumpkin
spice
melon
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
has
both
minor
alcohol
and
carbonation
bites
notes
from
9304
ofairly
drinkable
alcohol
is
always
there
but
noninhibiting
the
yeast
ester
profle
is
a
marvel
and
just
keeps
going
less
dry
than
a
duvel
and
head
is
a
letdown
but
otherwise
id
choose
this
over
duvel
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
i
underestimated
it
a
lot
because
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgium
beers
but
this
beer
has
just
changed
my
mind
a
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
pours
a
golden
brown
color
body
very
clear
and
fizzy
nearly
no
head
but
its
white
strong
dry
aroma
grapes
dark
fruit
complex
alcohol
smooth
taste
flowery
leafy
slightly
fizzy
dark
fruit
taste
of
alcohol
grapes
spices
warming
up
helps
aging
might
make
it
better
d
very
strong
but
a
good
grouping
of
flavors
and
aromas
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
made
beer
while
i
wouldnt
rank
it
up
with
some
of
its
belgian
cousins
its
still
a
solid
beer
not
my
favorite
from
avery
nor
is
it
my
favorite
example
of
this
belgian
style
glad
i
tried
it
not
really
one
id
repeat
excellently
drinkable
this
is
golden
light
amber
sunshine
with
a
pretty
quick
head
but
rtentive
lacing
ok
lacing
and
a
filmy
foam
very
little
to
no
bubbling
th
aroma
is
a
dried
flower
hops
and
kingly
breads
with
some
yeasty
fruits
pretty
convincign
scent
of
a
genuine
belgian
strong
ale
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
a
lovely
bread
grain
that
hints
at
tartness
dried
chrysanthamums
and
roses
with
fruity
ester
candi
sugar
and
almost
gourmet
white
bread
grains
the
palate
is
a
soft
syrupy
flower
nectar
with
lots
of
honey
notes
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
with
this
belgain
inspired
ale
good
conversation
beer
drinkability
a
nice
pleasant
belgian
strong
golden
though
a
bit
overtly
sweet
drinkability
is
ok
this
isnt
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
and
i
had
to
really
force
myself
to
drink
the
last
few
sips
because
the
alcohol
comes
out
way
to
much
once
it
warms
a
bit
some
strong
pleasant
flavors
that
dont
quite
balance
each
other
out
the
9
0
abv
goes
almost
undetected
this
one
may
benefit
from
a
little
aging
for
the
flavors
to
round
out
and
mellow
d
this
beer
ok
i
guess
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
the
taste
look
and
aroma
are
a
bit
too
basic
or
below
the
standards
this
beer
should
be
at
the
abv
isnt
too
bad
with
just
a
nice
warming
quality
the
verdict
is
that
this
beer
is
alright
but
it
could
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
moving
on
d
surprise
surprise
its
better
aged
it
was
good
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
vintage
beers
i
tried
that
day
drinkability
altogether
not
bad
at
all
though
id
rather
have
a
smaller
serving
of
la
chouffe
for
a
foamier
and
much
more
fragrant
golden
ale
little
weaker
on
fruit
flavors
than
i
like
as
well
great
full
mouthfeel
but
the
alcohol
and
the
sharpness
make
it
not
quite
as
easy
to
drink
as
some
golden
belgians
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
it
is
about
time
i
tried
the
other
component
of
collaboration
not
litigation
pretty
much
what
i
expected
and
definitely
know
where
the
avery
and
russian
river
beer
gets
its
fruity
belgian
accents
will
drink
again
recommended
d
very
nice
drinkability
spicy
and
really
enjoyed
this
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
comes
with
a
definite
recommend
less
carbonation
than
the
style
warrants
but
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
lush
and
full
so
its
a
bit
of
a
wash
solid
bspa
nevertheless
the
alcohol
is
far
less
noticeable
on
the
tongue
than
in
the
brain
its
not
hard
to
drink
so
heed
the
warning
signs
like
the
9
abv
sign
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
for
aging
while
the
2008
bottle
is
good
the
2005
and
2002
vintages
are
much
more
complex
and
dynamic
as
expected
the
malt
increases
with
age
but
the
phenolics
and
esters
also
dramatically
change
i
would
place
the
2002
as
the
best
of
the
three
with
2005
coming
in
second
pours
a
beautiful
orangeish
huge
with
a
big
white
frothy
head
on
it
it
looks
beautiful
in
my
snifter
the
smell
is
100
mandarin
oranges
it
took
me
a
second
to
point
it
out
but
i
think
it
smells
like
mandarin
oranges
taste
at
first
is
of
oranges
then
a
more
complex
fruity
and
alcohol
flavor
takes
over
mouthfeel
is
kinda
dry
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
good
beer
avery
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
american
breweries
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
it
is
definitely
drinkable
not
the
best
strong
golden
ive
had
but
still
pretty
good
definitely
a
decent
offering
just
didnt
match
up
to
my
tastesexpectations
i
find
this
an
excellent
belgian
with
lots
of
american
rocky
mountain
attitude
highly
recommended
and
i
will
drink
many
more
of
these
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
them
drinkability
is
moderate
average
flavor
and
high
alcohol
limit
this
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
a
very
solid
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
most
try
poured
into
a
snifter
and
got
a
thick
two
finger
off
white
head
that
was
very
fluffy
with
plenty
of
lacing
that
covered
a
hazy
medium
browngold
body
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
the
head
thins
out
a
bit
but
continues
to
completely
cover
the
body
of
the
beer
it
has
a
good
floral
aroma
with
some
spices
and
malts
coming
through
it
smells
sweet
mildly
citrusy
and
fresh
it
has
a
smooth
mediumtoheavy
body
and
is
balanced
over
all
nothing
is
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
i
can
pick
up
what
tastes
like
butterscotch
in
its
aftertaste
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
and
is
very
smooth
as
well
there
are
almost
no
hints
of
alcohol
and
only
a
mild
dry
mouth
feel
in
its
aftertaste
the
rich
toffee
sweetness
against
the
malt
makes
for
some
good
sips
but
after
drinking
all
22oz
the
sweetness
and
yeast
flavors
dont
sit
so
right
with
me
there
is
a
lot
of
nice
balanced
flavor
in
the
actual
drinking
but
once
im
finished
im
not
sure
this
is
necessarily
a
great
beer
d
pretty
strong
i
think
one
bottle
is
all
i
need
but
that
one
bottle
very
very
drinkable
d
wish
i
had
a
full
glass
i
could
ask
for
a
little
more
carbonation
i
always
want
a
duvelesque
foam
whenever
i
have
a
bspa
and
maybe
this
is
a
little
unfair
the
complexity
of
flavor
is
presentation
enough
and
makes
up
for
the
slightly
thickish
mouthfeel
lots
of
residual
sugars
are
left
on
the
tounque
and
lips
quite
enjoyable
this
was
yet
another
stellar
offer
for
me
from
avery
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
these
guys
look
foward
to
fifteen
the
next
in
my
fridge
avery
avery
avery
poured
out
of
the
bottle
in
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
great
apricot
nose
a
fantastic
balance
of
malt
hop
and
yeast
in
the
mouth
feel
and
finish
still
with
the
apricot
notes
and
hints
of
banana
what
a
hidden
9abv
love
the
yeasty
mouth
feel
that
doesnt
hang
around
and
feel
like
an
old
persons
closet
very
great
drinkability
would
even
be
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
keep
on
rockin
avery
a
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
it
lacks
the
smoothness
some
of
the
better
ones
have
and
the
taste
just
sorta
blend
in
with
some
of
the
other
ones
i
have
had
nothing
really
unique
this
was
a
recommendation
by
my
local
beer
buyer
and
he
was
very
enthusiastic
about
it
it
certainly
lived
up
to
his
raves
very
fruity
aroma
with
a
good
amount
of
yeast
smelling
just
short
of
a
nice
slice
of
homemade
bread
decent
carbonation
that
is
not
overbearing
plenty
of
apples
and
citrus
with
some
spice
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
nice
and
soft
overall
with
a
good
edge
that
adds
complexity
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
level
adds
warmth
dont
drink
it
too
fast
nice
label
as
i
said
this
thing
tastes
strong
and
it
really
shows
its
9
abv
but
the
taste
is
marvelous
its
really
everything
an
american
bspa
can
be
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
side
of
the
pond
clear
gold
very
very
little
head
and
not
much
lace
my
comparison
on
this
is
duvel
and
this
looks
nothing
like
it
really
smell
is
sugar
peppermint
phenols
and
oranges
the
taste
is
pepper
up
front
a
lovely
caramel
malt
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
nice
nice
nice
nice
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
if
a
bit
flat
drinkability
is
good
although
a
strong
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
reminds
you
not
to
find
it
too
drinkable
overall
definitely
one
id
buy
again
and
maybe
one
ill
share
if
youre
really
nice
to
me
or
hot
smooth
and
slick
in
the
mouth
with
a
hint
of
aromatic
alcohol
and
warming
high
abv
and
the
taste
of
alcohol
probably
limits
drinkability
but
if
this
were
served
colder
probably
not
d
not
my
favorite
avery
offering
pretty
standard
belgian
pale
ale
id
like
to
give
it
another
shot
a
rich
golden
hue
with
a
sily
off
white
head
nose
is
of
candy
malts
spicy
yeasts
and
some
light
fruity
hops
a
bit
mellow
for
the
style
like
the
nose
i
would
like
to
see
more
kick
in
the
flavor
profile
it
has
some
belgian
pepper
to
it
but
is
mostly
mild
sweet
malts
not
much
fruit
tartness
either
the
body
is
medium
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
but
fairl
ylight
for
teh
style
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
though
it
might
not
reach
the
greatness
of
some
others
of
the
style
it
is
certainly
a
very
good
brew
poured
into
a
snifter
very
bright
slightly
hazy
yellow
bright
white
head
that
settles
very
quickly
aroma
is
a
bit
yeasty
with
a
certain
belgian
candy
sweetness
to
it
can
taste
a
bit
of
hop
presence
and
an
assortment
of
spices
not
quite
to
the
extent
of
a
witbier
but
in
that
kind
of
direction
mouthfeel
is
very
moist
not
too
thin
not
to
thick
just
right
maybe
a
bit
too
fizzy
feeling
but
thats
about
it
a
very
light
belgian
style
brew
would
be
good
to
use
this
one
to
indroduce
some
to
belgian
ales
without
some
of
the
quirky
flavors
you
get
in
stronger
darker
brews
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
off
this
bomber
and
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
someday
its
crazy
to
think
this
is
9
abv
watch
out
theres
only
a
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
content
could
drink
this
all
evening
very
good
overall
this
is
great
example
of
american
breweries
ability
to
produce
excellent
belgians
of
any
stripe
a
good
beer
a
damn
good
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
one
glass
and
yer
out
brew
its
the
mouthfeel
that
limits
this
very
good
golden
ale
significantly
above
average
this
brew
has
attractive
golden
amber
tones
with
little
head
just
some
lacing
that
clings
to
the
glass
it
has
a
dried
fruit
smell
that
competes
with
a
strong
aura
of
booziness
a
slight
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
every
sip
but
my
strongest
impression
from
the
taste
was
the
flavor
of
raisins
the
consistency
is
between
light
and
medium
but
the
booziness
makes
it
more
suitable
for
sipping
the
beer
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
spicey
in
this
beer
consisting
of
white
pepper
honey
and
cherries
the
beer
smells
great
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
fairly
sweet
again
with
more
honey
and
cherry
however
there
is
a
good
dose
of
hops
noticeable
on
the
finish
giving
it
a
considerable
dry
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
bitterness
on
the
finish
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
still
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
in
this
beer
which
detracts
slightly
from
its
drinkability
that
being
said
this
is
a
very
impressive
effort
from
avery
nice
beer
d
great
offering
and
is
definately
a
beer
you
will
find
in
my
house
often
but
the
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
have
too
many
in
one
night
drinkability
is
good
decent
complexity
keeps
it
interesting
and
the
booze
smooth
but
to
sugary
to
really
want
to
drink
more
then
a
glass
or
two
it
would
fail
the
authentic
belgian
digestibility
test
for
sure
a
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
sweet
and
flowery
in
smell
with
a
wonderful
hints
of
belgian
sugars
and
yeast
a
bite
in
the
first
taste
the
alcohol
hits
right
away
the
second
is
just
as
strong
with
it
smoothing
out
over
time
not
as
drinkable
as
the
reverend
as
odd
as
that
sounds
a
good
tasting
beer
i
bet
its
the
9
that
throws
me
off
with
this
level
of
alcohol
and
the
22
oz
bottle
i
would
suggest
having
a
friend
join
you
for
this
one
i
think
it
would
stand
up
well
against
the
true
belgians
smell
is
a
muted
coriander
spice
and
apples
and
apricots
taste
really
brings
out
the
coriander
dry
biscuity
malt
body
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
nice
example
of
the
style
d
as
much
as
i
really
like
this
beer
for
its
unique
peppery
spicy
hop
flavors
and
its
affable
oddball
nature
i
dont
really
like
it
as
much
as
other
bspas
its
worth
trying
for
the
experience
but
id
pass
this
by
in
favor
of
many
other
bspas
as
the
unique
flavors
that
make
it
different
can
also
be
distracting
and
overbearing
theres
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
otherwise
a
somewhat
mild
but
nice
brew
very
easy
drinking
golden
belgian
yet
another
strong
effort
from
avery
drinkability
to
me
is
limited
while
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
theres
a
lot
of
heavyhitting
competition
in
this
style
category
its
more
of
a
slow
sipper
than
something
dangerously
drinkable
like
a
duvel
or
la
chouffe
really
hoppy
and
boozy
stuff
for
this
style
dont
be
dissuaded
by
the
relatively
low
score
im
giving
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
lately
i
agree
with
johntravolta
below
this
is
the
most
fruity
and
alcoholic
belgian
strong
blond
ive
had
ill
buy
again
when
i
want
a
boozy
slow
sipper
the
nose
had
sweet
honey
with
some
slight
perfume
notes
the
taste
was
sweet
golden
applesapricotand
orange
rhine
the
drinkabilty
would
score
higher
if
the
alcohol
level
wasnt
so
high
besides
that
this
brew
was
smooth
almost
a
irish
whiskey
qualitysome
mineral
content
and
wet
stone
dry
finish
wow
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
american
belgian
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
reasonable
price
its
worth
the
try
and
yes
id
drink
it
again
well
worth
purchasing
salvation
is
a
fascinating
alternative
to
the
reverend
still
one
of
my
very
favorites
from
avery
there
is
less
spice
but
more
smoothness
than
the
rev
making
this
very
refreshing
for
its
heft
d
this
bspa
has
a
much
more
complex
fruit
character
than
any
other
i
have
tried
and
its
my
favorite
style
i
have
also
never
tasted
on
with
such
a
strong
emphasis
on
tropical
fruit
its
certainly
not
a
fruit
beer
however
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
in
this
one
and
it
does
not
hide
i
have
to
give
avery
credit
on
this
very
different
example
of
the
style
they
are
a
great
brewery
i
will
probably
revisit
itbut
im
not
really
into
tropical
fruit
espicially
pineapple
ill
probably
stick
with
the
reverend
or
maharajah
as
my
avery
big
beers
another
big
beer
from
the
avery
brewing
company
this
belgianstyle
golden
ale
pours
a
crystalclear
lightbronze
applejuice
color
with
minimal
or
no
head
not
much
lacing
going
around
here
but
some
carbonation
present
smell
is
sharp
and
stings
with
a
freshfloral
grapefruitlike
aroma
that
clings
to
the
nose
taste
if
full
of
freshfruits
pears
grapefruit
esters
alcohol
citrus
and
bananas
very
clear
and
clean
flavor
with
a
good
clean
mouthfeel
the
9
abv
is
present
but
is
not
overbearing
drinkability
was
slightly
compromised
due
to
the
noticeable
alcohol
otherwise
the
rich
and
sweet
flavor
with
a
candiedaftertaste
hits
home
and
is
certainly
pleasing
good
stuff
from
avery
recommended
d
at
9
i
dont
know
how
many
glasses
i
could
handle
but
the
first
one
went
down
pretty
well
it
pours
a
lovely
golden
amber
with
some
fine
bubbles
and
a
white
fairly
persistent
head
aroma
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
and
has
an
odd
but
not
repulsive
rubbery
hint
flavor
is
fairly
rich
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
good
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
edgy
and
a
little
harsh
but
this
is
still
a
good
call
d
this
is
a
very
good
bspa
finally
having
it
for
the
first
time
today
on
par
with
the
greats
out
of
belgium
well
done
i
poured
this
one
into
a
belgian
goblet
and
was
rewarded
with
a
nice
head
that
gave
off
citrus
and
peppery
aromas
i
was
surprised
by
the
strong
malt
backbone
this
one
has
lots
of
belgians
rely
on
their
esters
for
flavor
salvation
had
strong
malt
hop
and
yeast
accents
so
it
was
one
satisfying
brew
d
strong
but
goes
down
easy
d
i
like
this
un
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cloves
tangerines
leather
and
earth
the
taste
is
more
earthy
than
the
aroma
and
has
only
a
hint
of
clove
and
tangerine
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
very
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
seems
to
take
away
from
the
beers
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
poured
a
hazy
opaque
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
fruity
aroma
apricots
comes
to
mind
taste
is
fruity
but
the
hops
linger
on
the
palate
nicely
balanced
avoids
being
overly
sweet
unlike
a
lot
of
true
belgians
modest
mouthfeel
provides
a
bit
of
creaminess
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
not
earth
shattering
but
tasty
i
cant
really
say
much
about
this
brew
its
fairly
inexpensive
and
i
think
it
could
hold
a
place
as
a
semiauthentic
reproduction
of
middleoftheroad
pale
belgians
taste
and
aroma
are
accurate
but
wildly
understated
feels
nice
on
the
mouth
at
first
but
stick
with
a
first
glass
if
you
find
it
for
really
really
cheap
grill
up
some
spicy
kebabs
itd
make
the
dinner
party
into
a
drunken
debauche
even
though
the
score
isnt
all
that
high
i
did
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
its
just
not
overly
complex
or
as
bold
of
a
flavor
as
i
am
used
to
from
avery
its
just
a
very
solid
beer
with
nothing
that
makes
it
truly
amazing
as
much
as
i
like
collaboration
not
litigation
with
its
bold
flavor
i
did
expect
a
little
more
from
this
one
i
guess
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
the
russian
river
version
now
d
okay
it
is
nothing
great
i
had
collaboration
not
litigation
i
think
i
liked
that
better
than
this
which
suggests
i
should
try
rrs
salvation
i
really
need
to
get
over
there
soon
i
wont
have
this
one
again
its
kind
of
funny
like
avery
even
though
i
give
most
of
their
beers
mediocre
reviews
i
guess
i
just
like
that
their
brewing
is
original
and
interesting
if
not
always
delcious
keep
it
up
guys
i
need
to
find
the
14
soon
i
liked
this
a
lot
a
well
worthwhile
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dies
down
rather
quickly
smell
is
a
little
sweet
and
spicy
peppery
taste
is
very
similar
with
some
dried
fruits
on
the
palate
some
earthy
hop
presence
too
mouthfeeling
is
light
and
a
little
watery
pretty
good
beer
i
think
itd
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
dryer
but
thats
splitting
hairs
overall
a
good
drinkable
offering
that
deals
with
the
abv
quite
well
avery
is
topnotch
quaffable
i
cant
wait
to
try
collaboration
not
litigation
this
excellent
bspa
tastes
like
it
would
great
with
a
sour
offering
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
new
belgium
snifter
poured
a
golden
color
with
small
amount
of
orangish
hue
with
a
white
head
that
foamed
up
to
fade
rather
quickly
to
leave
a
small
trace
of
foam
smell
of
spice
and
corriander
with
yeasty
malt
aroma
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
phenolic
flavors
slight
bitterness
of
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
carbonate
which
helps
shows
the
alcohol
of
9
a
good
beer
from
avery
overall
d
the
9
is
heady
so
beware
the
flavors
are
strong
but
they
are
indistinguishable
from
most
other
bspas
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
decent
enough
fluffy
head
from
the
initial
pour
the
second
glass
was
better
than
the
first
as
the
beer
had
a
chance
to
warm
up
and
the
flavors
cme
thrugh
much
better
had
a
lot
of
grapefruit
with
nice
spice
and
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
as
well
good
american
alternative
to
the
belgian
golden
ales
and
will
try
this
one
again
d
this
brews
sweetness
is
so
cloying
that
it
was
hard
to
get
through
the
first
12
ounces
alone
let
alone
the
last
10
the
beer
filled
me
up
and
left
me
craving
something
drier
overall
a
quality
brew
as
most
from
avery
seem
to
be
this
was
my
first
shot
at
one
of
their
belgian
styles
and
it
was
just
classic
a
good
all
around
brew
i
would
definatly
like
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
at
some
point
very
impressed
and
i
would
recommend
a
try
to
anyone
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
went
down
smoothly
and
the
taste
was
consistent
even
getting
richer
as
it
warmed
and
opened
up
you
can
definitely
feel
the
high
alcohol
content
so
i
savored
the
beer
for
a
while
serving
type
650ml
bottle
poured
into
st
bernardus
goblet
overall
not
my
favorite
strong
pale
ale
the
weak
head
did
it
for
me
the
most
in
the
end
it
didnt
really
fit
the
style
all
that
well
still
it
is
a
good
brew
and
worth
a
try
d
would
be
drinkable
except
that
i
dont
enjoy
the
taste
this
beer
looks
fantastic
a
clear
dark
gold
almost
orange
color
it
also
has
a
great
big
whit
head
and
it
leaves
tons
of
lace
i
dont
know
how
a
beer
could
look
any
better
than
this
smells
malty
and
fruity
with
very
very
slight
hops
taste
is
full
of
sweetness
lots
of
orange
tones
with
an
alcohol
twinge
after
the
tornado
of
flavors
it
is
not
really
that
bad
but
the
high
alcohol
will
limit
my
drinkability
rating
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
went
away
fast
in
the
nose
sweet
alcohol
somewhat
light
fruitiness
in
the
taste
a
dry
pear
charicteristic
and
alcohol
backing
that
up
it
leaves
a
dryness
in
the
mouth
with
the
alcohol
still
there
i
feel
this
is
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
the
yeast
really
shouts
the
loudest
in
this
one
the
malt
is
an
understatement

i
keep
forgetting
its
there
and
the
hops
add
only
the
tart
leafy
bit
of
tripartisan
voice
necessary
to
be
in
balance
what
fun
i
do
like
avery
with
221
reviews
as
of
this
writing
i
will
add
this
to
the
collective
a
great
looking
beer
that
is
a
bit
hot
and
unapproachable
taste
wise
until
it
comes
up
from
cellar
temp
to
room
temp
once
the
brew
was
in
the
upper
60s
it
really
smoothed
out
and
became
quite
tasty
it
may
be
the
sequence
i
tried
these
in
that
is
influencing
my
perspective
as
i
write
this
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
on
its
own
merits
to
see
for
yourself
090808
im
updating
this
review
to
add
that
this
is
a
really
mediocre
beer
in
fact
it
sucks
pours
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
spice
and
floral
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balance
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
belgians
with
the
hops
kicked
up
a
bit
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
avery
beers
the
yeast
bite
and
sweet
fruit
flavored
malts
complement
the
hops
nicely
the
beer
is
somewhat
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
this
is
a
yet
another
enjoyable
beer
from
avery
for
a
beer
that
started
out
so
promising
this
let
me
down
its
alcohol
flavors
are
just
a
little
too
powerful
for
me
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
purchased
in
mid
may
poured
a
chill
hazed
deep
golden
but
then
turns
clear
rich
gold
as
it
warms
the
smell
is
fruit
and
candy
sweet
there
is
also
the
slightest
belgain
funky
yeast
smell
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
sugar
and
a
bit
of
mild
hops
are
detectable
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
a
bit
slick
because
there
is
no
carbonated
burn
very
fine
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
overall
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
are
so
good
it
can
be
very
drinkable
but
beware
at
9
overall
just
a
bit
more
full
bodied
and
sweeter
than
damnation
this
beer
starts
out
like
it
is
going
to
kick
ass
but
winds
up
being
a
sugary
mess
pours
a
golden
orangish
amber
color
with
a
light
white
head
thin
that
leaves
a
lot
of
brussels
lace
the
aroma
is
minty
with
hops
and
also
has
some
sweet
biscuity
notes
and
solvent
alcohol
theres
a
phenolic
quality
in
the
background
in
spite
of
the
different
notes
its
a
slight
nottooevocative
nose
on
the
palate
things
get
more
interesting
with
bitter
hops
first
off
followed
by
some
sweeter
slightly
acidic
fruit
notes
strawberry
lemon
with
a
biscuity
buttery
malt
underpinning
the
finish
is
dry
which
is
unusual
for
american
versions
of
belgian
styles
and
helps
immensely
in
both
authenticity
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
well
carbonated
and
a
touch
acidic
which
gives
a
citric
impression
overall
this
is
very
good
one
of
the
better
belgian
style
beers
from
an
american
brewer
that
ive
had
the
head
retention
on
this
beer
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
it
starts
with
an
amazing
white
frothy
head
that
doesnt
quit
the
lacing
is
prodigious
and
the
pour
is
a
nice
golden
orange
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
alcohol
spices
coriander
sweet
fruits
and
very
enticing
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
strong
and
unbalanced
towards
the
alcohol
notes
for
my
tastes
you
will
find
a
medium
bodied
sweet
alcoholy
malty
spicy
beer
that
is
surprisingly
more
watery
than
your
typical
belgian
strong
ale
the
back
of
the
palate
and
after
taste
is
where
the
burnt
yeastiness
comes
out
and
the
strong
alcohol
notes
really
pronounce
themselves
when
i
start
to
feel
some
heartburn
coming
on
i
know
we
have
a
problem
not
bad
but
it
just
aint
as
good
as
your
belgian
strong
ales
from
across
the
pond
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
a
little
prickly
carbonation
a
decent
belgian
pale
in
my
book
but
its
just
like
most
others
of
the
style
out
there
for
me
easy
enough
to
drink
though
no
major
issues
with
this
one
palates
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
pluses
the
brew
has
candisugar
sweetness
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
some
hoppy
bitterness
but
the
complexity
hoped
for
from
the
belgian
yeast
aroma
profile
fails
to
come
through
as
sugary
sweetness
ultimately
wins
out
not
so
much
in
the
flavor
as
in
the
stickiness
on
the
lips
and
in
the
mouth
through
the
finish
a
nice
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
that
just
misses
the
mark
but
is
not
without
redeeming
qualities
d
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
delicious
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
not
too
spicy
the
pouridge
is
just
right
afterdinner
treat
pours
a
golden
straw
color
quite
cloudy
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
are
dominated
yeasty
esters
of
banana
a
little
clove
and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
quite
a
bit
of
hops
are
detected
in
the
nose
uncharacteristic
of
belgians
but
they
seem
to
be
of
the
styrian
golding
variety
or
other
european
types
on
the
palate
the
hops
dominate
creating
a
very
bitter
front
to
the
continuing
fruitiness
quite
dry
with
a
long
finish
on
second
thought
there
may
actually
be
a
bit
of
american
hops
in
here
given
the
strong
citrus
notes
and
high
bitterness
this
is
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
mouth
not
as
vibrant
in
carbonation
as
most
belgians
still
a
good
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
d
im
not
sure
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
really
straight
forward
not
overly
complex
and
the
end
bitterness
sucks
dhigh
abv
is
dangerously
hidden
but
this
is
not
a
mindblowing
must
have
in
my
eyes
definatly
a
good
beer
but
i
wanted
a
bit
more
balance
in
this
drinkability
nice
to
try
probably
would
not
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
avery
typically
brews
solid
beer
that
falls
short
of
what
i
would
consider
great
new
world
porter
ipa
and
the
czar
are
delicious
exceptions
to
that
rule
salvation
is
an
enjoyable
big
beer
that
comes
close
enough
to
the
belgian
masters
to
be
well
worth
the
5
99
that
i
spent
on
the
bomber
the
next
time
i
buy
it
though
im
going
to
lay
it
down
for
at
least
three
years
drinkability
good
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
with
enough
complexity
to
inspire
a
long
slow
drinking
session
and
as
it
gets
better
with
warmth
the
high
alchohol
matters
less
i
could
sip
on
this
one
beer
for
hours
dnotes
a
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
classic
would
have
liked
some
more
fruitiness
in
the
flaovr
department
very
drinkable
despite
relatively
high
alcohol
content
the
body
is
medium
carbonation
is
gentle
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
however
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
were
given
some
time
to
mellow
out
the
burn
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
though
poured
a
hazy
golden
amber
hue
into
tulip
glass
capped
by
a
thin
white
head
that
stuck
around
quite
a
while
for
its
initial
petite
size
aroma
quite
strong
of
belgian
yeast
pepper
and
fruit
esters
and
a
slight
farmy
buzz
from
the
hops
taste
more
of
the
same
but
a
steely
hop
finish
a
bit
too
metallic
in
the
bitterness
sweet
up
front
with
honey
and
raisins
mouthfeel
is
good
strong
carbonation
but
does
nothing
to
improve
the
experience
as
the
brew
warms
the
metallic
aspects
come
out
further
and
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
less
than
desirable
salvation
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
i
think
i
can
smell
the
candy
sugar
taste
is
kind
of
bitter
a
bit
peppery
from
the
alcohol
too
theres
a
little
bit
of
fruit
too
the
taste
improves
dramatically
as
it
warms
up
but
in
any
case
its
still
not
very
exciting
in
my
book
pours
a
medium
to
amber
gold
with
a
relatively
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
with
candy
sugar
cloves
banana
and
cinammon
the
taste
is
much
less
sweet
with
a
healthy
hit
of
hops
adding
a
topnote
to
the
sweeter
under
flavors
the
sweet
flavors
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
first
crisp
and
then
with
a
fairly
creamy
finish
a
little
mouthcoating
pretty
delicious
and
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
overall
a
nice
beer
that
is
a
little
heavier
and
more
bitter
than
is
usual
for
the
style
with
sweeter
notes
than
some
as
well
but
these
balance
the
bitterness
nicely
overall
this
brew
will
be
appreciated
more
by
those
who
enjoy
the
sweeter
style
of
belgian
ales
as
the
candy
sugar
is
quite
predominate
not
bad
at
all
and
nice
to
share
with
a
friend
this
is
a
solid
belgian
golden
not
as
complex
and
unique
as
some
but
definately
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
the
price
is
good
too
at
4
99
a
bomber
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
22oz

pours
a
heavy

almost
amber
with

and
excellent
lace
nice
rich
heavy

aromas
mixed

floalness
just
teases
the
nose
big
malt
flavors
quickly
followed
by
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
too
bad
to
me
this
one
is
just
2
dimentional
it
goes
from
straight
malt
to
straight
hop
with
not
much
in
between
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
excite
me
all
that
much
22
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
with
local
boston
band
the
slip
on
the
hifi
color
is
a
brass
copper
with
small
head
which
fades
a
little
bit
smells
of
banana
caramel
and
bread
tastes
abit
spicy
and
lemony
this
was
boring
though
the
flavor
is
everywhere
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
smoother
and
the
abv
is
somewhat
hidden
but
the
flavor
is
not
my
style
d
good
times
nice
belgian
style
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
belgian
style
ale
with
9
abv
but
you
dont
really
notice
that
till
the
end
go
out
and
try
this
one
its
worth
a
shot
purchased
at
sam
right
next
to
the
collaboration
not
litigation
ale
chilled
and
poured
into
watou
goblet
nice
creamy
pure

thick
with
wonderful
snow
like
lumpy
lacing
body
is
a
warm
peachish
amber
color
with
blond
highlights
clear
warm
and
reflective
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
clean
i
get
juicy
pear
esters
right
up
front
with
that
sort
of
spicy
peppery
character
which
is
slightly
less
apparent
in
this
than
some
belgian
strong
pales
taste
is
again
fresh
and
crisp
with
more
light
esters
some
pear
and
maybe
even
apple
coming
toward
the
midsection
with
a
slight
tart
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
the
alcohol
might
be
just
a
little
too
much
if
i
was
drinking
with
food
but
for
just
drinking
its
fine
with
me
totally
worth
a
try
nice
take
on
a
b
s
p
ale
cheers
bottom
line
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
of
the
style
from
avery
and
is
at
least
worth
trying
despite
the
alcohol
or
maybe
because
of
it
i
want
another
immediately
very
drinkable
lovely
beer
this
hides
its
strength
well
but
is
just
too
dominated
by
tangy
belgian
yeast
flavors
to
be
something
id
want
a
lot
of
thanks
vancer
and
no
bs
bif
beta
the
hop
character
is
large
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
in
fact
it
seems
to
die
off
rather
quickly
d
another
great
big
bottle
beer
from
avery
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
can
always
count
on
the
avery
bombers
to
be
a
little
different
this
belgian
had
a
strong
pinapplehops
aroma
and
taste
to
go
along
with
the
standard
pale
belgian
sweetness
and
spice
not
amazing
or
too
complex
but
nice
and
different
worth
a
try
for
the
price
and
could
make
a
nice
stocking
stuffer
for
the
approaching
holidays
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
with
some
yeasty
characteristics
mostly
peach
with
some
pineapple
citrus
smell
going
on
the
taste
is
similar
yeasty
hoppy
and
fruity
the
aftertaste
has
a
kick
of
the
abv
but
stays
consistant
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
light
adding
to
this
beer
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
can
knock
you
on
your
but
if
you
take
down
a
few
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
it
is
a
belgian
worth
trying
enjoy
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
abit
of
a
reddish
hint
and
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
has
a
full
bisquity
aroma
with
sweet
malt
that
disappears
pretty
fast
the
taste
is
creamy
with

hiding
the
high

very
well
a
decent
beer
from
one
of
the
better
breweries
in
the
u
s
due
to
the
high
abv
its
not
even
close
sessionable
and
its
not
so
good
that
youd
kill
for
it
in
fact
i
dont
know
how
far
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
not
one
to
regret
either
just
a
little
offbalance
cheers
beertracker
the
mouth
is
complex
bright
on
the
front
gets
a
dry
for
awhile
as
some
spices
kick
in
then
finishes
sticky
on
the
lips
another
good
one
from
avery
drinkability
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
still
quite
interesting
and
complex
i
think
these
go
well
with
food
or
as
an
a
night
cap
pretty
high
alcohol
limits
the
number
of
these
you
could
have
in
a
row
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
average
belgian
strong
pale
it
did
improve
as
it
warmed
though
overall
its
not
a
bad
belgianstyle
ale
but
a
bit
too
jacked
up
like
other
extreme
american
craft
brews
the
aroma
had
me
expecting
a
lot
and
i
wanted
more
from
the
flavor
than
i
ended
up
getting
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
notable
going
on
when
the
palate
gets
its
chance
that
and
the
healthy
abv
makes
more
than
a
glass
an
unlikely
happenstance
i
guess
i
expect
a
bit
more
from
my
salvation
than
this
is
willing
to
grant

and

a
good
balance
between
the
alcohol
and
malty

went
down
surprisingly
crisp
a
nice
bubbly
sensation
carries
the
whole
way
down
for
that
great
warming
feeling
and
a
slight
alcoholhoppy
aftertaste
d
good
and
tasty
im
not
familiar
enough
with
the
belgain
strong
ale
style
to
say
if
this
is
an
authentic
rendition
but
regardless
its
damn
good
taste
the
flavor
carries
through
more
so
than
the
aroma
did
this
is
definitely
fruity
with
bananas
lemons
and
apricots
this
has
a
very
sweet
honey
like
quality
thats
balanced
a
bit
by
some
peppery
spiciness
with
a
prominant
alcohol
presence
unfortunately
this
became
pretty
harsh
after
it
warmed
up
and
became
quite
a
bit
harder
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
drinkability
that
takes
a
hit
due
to
a
high
alcohol
content
and
a
sweetness
that
becomes
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
this
is
a
good
brew
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
odd
seltzer
flavor
for
my
tastes
pours
a
light
golden
ale
with
no
head
this
beer
has
all
kinds
of
smell
those
including
apple
citrus
and
a
bit
of
alcoholic
overtone
my
first
sip
packs
a
punch
but
im
ready
for
another
wow
there
it
is
again
ripe
apples
and
a
fruity
aftertaste
linger
carbonation
is
mild
and
just
right
for
this
style
of
beer
nice
to
see
something
of
this
caliber
to
come
out
of
colorodo
and
representing
a
belgian
favorite
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
is
the
9
abv
which
makes
it
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
once
again
avery
has
nailed
it
d
upon
my
first
sip
i
got
the
feeling
of
high
alcohol
content
but
then
every
other
ingredient
quickly
washes
over
and
instantly
mellows
its
presence
this
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian
not
heavy
at
all
quite
refreshing
but
you
know
the
alcohol
will
get
you
excellent
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
more
from
avery
so
far
my
favorite
belgian
the
mouthfeel
was
bright
and
fresh
with
little
oxygen
character
got
this
one
fresh
methinks
keep
up
the
good
work
avery
bottle
courtesy
of
daalamar
poured
a
clean
dark
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
little
retention
aroma
of
candi
sugar
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
doesnt
allow
for
much
else
taste
is
very
sweet
with
very
little
yeast
or
spices
characteristics
alcohol
is
pretty
subdued
but
a
bit
too
onedimensional
and
boring
in
my
own
opinion
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
disipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
picked
up
a
spicey
hops
aroma
in
the
smell
but
then
followed
by
a
yeast
that
wasnt
like
any
belgian
strand
ive
had
before
the
taste
was
very
yeasty
giving
it
an
almost
sour
taste
however
not
sour
enough
for
my
to
say
this
beer
was
spoiled
it
was
an
almost
medium
body
beer
that
didnt
fint
to
the
alcohol
at
all
the
beers
finish
was
semidry
its
a
slow
beer
to
drink
while
i
cannot
say
its
the
worse
beer
ive
had
it
defenitely
doesnt
rank
very
high
on
the
list
for
me
this
is
a
high
alcohol
sipper
nice
label
not
a
go
to
beer
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
not
anything
exceptional
just
ordinary
i
would
drink
it
again
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
snow
white
head
that
went
away
in
about
40
seconds
smell
is
sweet
malt
a
little
bit
of
candied
fruit
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
the
smell
amplified
especially
the
sweetness
for
what
this
is
and
considering
i
dont
really
care
much
for
this
style
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
and
just
a
good
beer
all
the
way
around
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
while
a
little
thick
and
heavy
drinkability
is
down
a
bit
due
to
the
strength
and
the
weight
of
the
beer
overall
i
was
impressed
id
buy
this
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
creamy
buttery
coating
and
mouthfilling
are
the
words
that
come
to
mind
all
similar
in
description
and
all
apply
with
their
subtle
differences
winelike
in
its
grace
and
deep
complex
character
big
and
warming
in
the
belly
glad
to
have
tried
it
yes
indeed
yet
another
winner
from
avery
who
are
seriously
working
their
way
into
contention
of
becoming
my
favourite
brewery
for
me
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
desert
island
beers
oft
discussed
and
nominated
in
the
forum
a
decent
enough
belgian
golden
this
is
still
a
wonderful
brew
for
the
smell
and
balance
alone
but
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
is
pretty
much
my
favorite
style
in
the
summer
months
im
probably
more
critical
than
most
with
this
style
ill
probably
pick
this
one
up
again
if
only
to
break
up
my
usual
rare
vos
or
la
fin
du
monde
drinkability
i
know
what
the
abv
is
but
i
could
still
drink
this
like
a
fratboy
so
drinkable
hell
yes
better
as
it
warms
but
overall
a
decent
american
version
of
a
belgian
golden
pretty
bottle
and
label
too
very
smoothcreamy
on
the
palate
some
luscious
pear
and
peach
flavors
bit
of
alcohol
malt
quite
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
background
drinkability
goes
down
well
and
is
good
high
abv
limits
it
to
one
in
any
given
session
salvation
is
a
bright
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
mediumsized
head
carbonation
is
mild
the
aroma
is
very
strong
citrus
and
spice
smells
burst
out
alongside
an
underlying
candi
sugar
sweetness
taste
is
very
spicy
with
plenty
of
citrus
flavors
the
spice
flavors
are
very
peppery
and
are
aided
by
an
edge
of
hop
flavor
an
underlying
sugary
sweetness
keeps
the
other
flavors
from
a
total
domination
of
the
palate
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
noted
in
the
finish
i
found
this
to
be
excellent
the
strong
spice
and
citrus
flavors
really
won
me
over
and
the
layering
of
flavors
was
pretty
awesome
as
well
highly
recommended
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
i
would
buy
this
one
again
avery
did
well
with
this
overall
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
its
quite
drinkable
though
being
at
9
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
but
i
wouldnt
exactly
bring
this
one
over
to
belgium
to
show
off
what
we
have
been
doing
this
beer
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
its
a
very
solid
brew
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
glad
i
tried
it
spicy
mouthfeel
all
around
i
liked
the
spiciness
to
it
full
bodied
d
not
bad
at
all
for
a
style
that
im
not
always
a
huge
fan
of
straight
4s
for
me
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
about
it
decent
warming
in
the
alcohol
dept
i
wouldnt
put
salvation
away
like
i
do
the
sn
bigfoot
however
i
would
definitely
drink
one
again
in
the
future
enjoy

by
the
brewery

consumed
three
days
after

from

combination
ive
never
had
before
the
combination
of
the
two
is

interesting

flavors
i
get
are
caramel
mild
apricot

beer
is

stingy

aftertaste
is

and
iron
mdthick

modestly
carbonated

to
style
supose
to
have
a
huge
billowy
head
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
some
amber
red
hints
head
is
very
dissapointing
and
almost
nonexistent

redeem

thin

carbonation
stream
from
the
base

the
chimay

mild
some
yeast
notes
and
some
appricot
fruit
notes
but
nothing
special
taste
is
somewhat
bland
a
little
bit
of
spicyness
but
just
not
much
to
talk
about
the
beer
is
just
very
average
at
best
noticable
alcohol
finish
completes
the
underwhelming
experience
overall
a
big
disspointment
and
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
d
high

good
beer
great
job
good
balance
of
bitter
and
spiciness
this
relatively
nice
ale
pours
a
nice
pale
amber
color
the
white
head
is
a
good
size
but
does
not
last
long
at
all
the
head
does
return
with
a
gentle
swirl
and
swirling
can
be
addictive
fun
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
with
apples
coming
to
mind
this
fruity
smell
seems
to
be
a
bit
distinct
from
the
hint
of
alcohol
also
coming
through
the
taste
affects
the
taste
bud
located
on
both
the
palate
and
the
tongue
a
bit
differently
the
taste
on
softpalate
is
very
nice
a
light
at
fruity
flavor
being
carried
with
the
carbonation
the
tongue
is
another
matter
a
rather
stickyand
unpleasant
feel
and
strongly
alcohol
taste
average
out
this
is
a
nice
beverage
but
not
one
that
i
can
recommend
searching
out
there
are
significantly
better
offerings
out
there
for
this
variety
good
to
see
american
breweries
creating
great

doesnt
quite
get
it
right

with

sweet
dry
and
a
bit

beer
i
will
drink
again

a

beer
great

feel
thats
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
more
often
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
bodied
crisp
and
sweetly
spicey
an
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
but
the
flavors
cant
be
argued
with
some
of
my
favorite
belgians
have
more
of
a
wild
charachter
but
this
beer
earns
its
stripes
with
complexity
abundant
flavor
and
firm
backbone
bravo
beer
is
good
hapy
beering
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
flavorful
this
is
9
alcohol
and
tastes
it
but
it
is
also
smooth
and
silky
a
nice
ale
whose
drinkability
is
marred
only
by
its
high
alcohol
content
pored
a
nice
translucent
copper
color
wiht
a
white
fluffy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
a
touch
of
lacing
in
my
goblet
moderatehigh
carbonation
with
large
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
aromas
of
honey
melon
grass
and
caramel
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
with
fruit
flavors
to
offset
subtle
bitterness
juicy
ripe
fruit
flavors
were
quite
pronounced
in
this
beer
dry
finish
with
lingering
sweetness
that
develops
turns
sour
over
time
the
biggest
knock
on
this
beer
is
that
the
aftertaste
contained
a
chalky
texture
and
flavor
it
felt
like
i
had
taken
a
bite
out
of
a
piece
of
chalk
the
aftertaste
didnt
bother
me
at
first
but
it
continued
for
several
hours
after
i
finished
the
beer
and
was
not
enjoyable
as
a
result
the
drinkability
takes
a
drastic
hit
drinkable
enough
kind
of
reminds
me
of
duvel
but
not
really
my
style
overall
im
glad
i
got
a
22
oz
bottle
im
sure
the
9
will
also
make
this
appealing
to
finish
however
probably
the
nicest
avery
product
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
drinkability
easy
drinker
that
seems
a
bit
less
of
the
9
than
is
states
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
though
tastes
decent
enough
and
went
down
well
worth
a
try

you

a
chance

a
nice

from

a
good
brew
with
a
few
areas
that
made
it
less
distinguished
and
impressionable
then
most
of
the
belgian
goldens
out
there
a
good
old
fashion
american
try
that
works
in
most
ways
but
perhaps
a
bit
understated

less

it
could
be
a

undercarbonated
very
drinkable
though
all
in
all
a
good

pretty
decent

not
that
outstanding

one
was
sitting
around

it
smoothed
out
a
bit
nice
beer
and
better
than
expected
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium

this

there
is

nice

between
hops
and

this
ale
this
beer
is
only
available

grab
a

it
up
in

needs
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
love
my
hopped
up
beers
but
this
one
just
seems
off
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
mix
well
even
though
you
would
expect
them
too
after
my
initial
taste
i
really
was
having
a
hard
time
distinguishing
this
beer
from
the
maharaja
that
i
had
a
few
days
before
after
a
few
more
drinks
i
found
that
belgian
flavor
that
i
was
wanting
not
really
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
enjoyed
it
as
i
do
all
beers
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
the

alcohol
content
will
make
you
feel
quite
nice

as

as
drinkability
goes
well
the
9
is
certainly
extremely
sneaky
and
hidden
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
i
can
see
myself
in
the
mood
for
this
from
time
to
time
but
ultimately
there
are
many
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
id
rather
be
enjoying
give
it
a
shot
the
beer
shows
a
slightly
hazed
shade
of
golden
carbonation
surfaces
at
a
moderate
pace
thin
white

disappears
quickly
and
the
rimming
that
is
left
behind
leaves
sparse

aroma
is
warm
toasty
and
bready
sweet
and
fruity
too
the
flavor
improves
on
the
nose
becomes
more
pronounced
with
bready
malt
tones
forming
a
nice
base
and

it

quite
goodi
would

still

had

yee
will
find
no

here
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
say
that
this
isnt
a
good
example
of
a
belgium
golden
ale
style
but
rather
as
an
american
style
belgium
golden

very
smooth
and
taste
a
bit
more
hoppier
and
a
high

is

its

thick

accentuated
the
feeling
of
consuming
a
big
special
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
there
was
almost
no
burn
the
aftertaste
was
peppery
citric
and
sweet
a
big
beer
that
does
not
feel
harsh
and
aggressive

instead
is
like
a

thick

the
first
taste
raised
the
hairs
on
my
arms
quite
hoppy
quite
too
much
so
for
me
but
i
can
see
where
one
who
is
a
fan
of
dogfishs
90minute
ipa
would
really
enjoy
this
i
do
very
much
appreciate
the
complex
pang
of
sweetness
at
the
finish
i
couldnt
drink
this
regularly
but
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
hop
head
i
found
it
a
little
dull
for
the
style
just
not
as
crisp
and
delicately
balanced
as
it
could
be
instead
it
seems
a
bit
flabby
and
uninteresting
there
are
no
flaws
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
its
just
a
basic
well
done
dextrinous
belgianstyle
golden
ale
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
pale
malt
and
belgian
candy
sugar
scent
along
with
a
belgian
yeast
aroma
it
is
rich
and
malty
with
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
slightly
warm
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
candy
sugar
it
goes
down
easy
with
quite
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
nice
touch
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
belgian
ale
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
it
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
but
thats
what
i
like
about
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
little
white
head
aroma
fruity
peach
pears
and
apricot
yeast
and
a

cinnamon
and
a
nice
blend
of
fruits
orange
peaches
and
a
hint
of
cherries
and
sweet
malts
and
some
hops
and
yeast
the
alcohol
comes
out
just
a
little
a
nice
blond
colored
ale
with
a
large
head
served
in
a
snifter
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
smell
and
taste
are
more
hoppy
than
id
expect
from
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
but
a
nice
change
from
the
norm
lemon
citrus
and
spicey
corriander
balance
out
the
hops
a
little
and
theres
some
sweet
maltyness
to
the
beer
as
well
theres
an
odd
soapy
character
to
the
beer
that
i
find
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
turn
off
but
otherwise
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
think
it
might
be
even
better
if
it
was
simplified
a
little
hops
are
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
taste

drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
stands
out
as
a
very
refined
example
with
the
iconoclastic
character
you
would
expect
from
avery
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
falls
slowly
and
leaves
a
little

the

has
a

of

and
sweetness
with
some
graininess
and
spices
as
well
very
strong

the

has
a

the

is
interesting
but
its
not
completely
up

and
very
wellcrafted
but
i
like
my
belgian
slightly
different
from
this
lots
of

the

definately
makes
this

this

still
salvation
comes

outstripping
the

not
one
id
come
back
to
soon
overall
i
cant
recommend
this

perhaps
i
just
sampled
a
bad
bottle
but
if
not
this
one
hit
me
the
wrong
way
on
all
notes
of
taste
shared
with
me
by
clvand0
it
pours
a

with

that
falls
to
one
finger
the
nose
is
big
with
whiffs
of

slight
raisiney

and
a
big

the
flavor
is
more
subdued
than
the

the
raisiney
sweetness
is
backed
with
a
slightly
bready
ness
and
a
bit
of
citrusy

moving
into
the
spiceyness
the
feel
is
bigh
and
thick
and
full
wtih
only
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
flavor
is
just
okay
on
this

comments
while
the
beer
has
complex
flavors
and
is
generally
pretty
appealing
it
is
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
like
maybe
this

would

before
i
would
the
reverend
22
ounce
bottle
this
was
an
ipa
perhaps
a
double
ipa
the
bottle
says
belgian
golden
but
there
was
very
little
about
it
that
was
belgian
it
was
a
tasty
brew
nonetheless
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
extremely
drinkable
but
it
is
very
tasty
i
have
had
averys
czar
and
felt
that
the
alcohol
overpowered
everything
else
i
was
expected
that
to
happen
with
this
brew
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
taste
like
a
few
other
avery
beers
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
the
alcohol
in
this
one
overpowered
the
other
flavors
at
times
luckily
this
happened
only
occasionaly
the
majority
of
the
time
things
balanced
out
fairly
nicely
when
i
was
able
to
detect
the
other
flavors
there
were
sweet
apples
tart
cherries
and
plums
green
grass
was
present
along
the
sides
of
the
tongue
in
the
middle
the
finish
was
a
combonation
of
strong
roasted
malt
hops
bitterness
and
a
continuation
of
the
green
grass
as
i
said
sometimes
the
alcohol
overpowered
everything
but
most
of
the
time
it
just
lended
a
pleasant
spicy
component
to
the
brew
a
light
pepper
flavor
lingered
into
the
aftertaste
pours

translucent

is

not
as
elegant
as
it
should
be
the
malts

fruits
give
way
too
quickly
to
a
bitter
acrid
alcohol
taste
which
lingers
after
you
swallow
could
be
better
but
still
pretty
good
and

alcohol
packs
a

it

22oz

this
one
pours
a
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
limited
amount
of
head
on
it
and
it
died
off
quickly
there
is
a
very
apealing
aroma
to
this
beer
no
one
scent
is
on
top
but
i
get
definite
notes
of
apricots
nutmeg
and
some
yeastiness
the
taste
is
quite
slick
there
aare
the
peaches
and
apricots
in
there
as
well
as
some
spiciness

a

of

apricot
sugar
and

quite
sweet
and
sugary
this
begins
with
a
load
of
sweet

and
dried

and
develops
into
a
slightly
more
zesty
mid
palate
before
closing
with
sweet
biting
alcohol
and
mild
hops
decent
belgian
imitator
that
said
i
find
it
very
drinkable
maybe
even
dangerously
so
i
paired
this
with
a
simple
ham
sandwhich
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
compared
to
others
in
a
similar
style
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
good
american
tripels
are
few
and
far
between
golden
monkey
and
this
is
no
exception
avery
is
usually
quality
but
i
cannot
go
on
the
books
recommending
this
overall
impression
popped
this
for
a
christmas
day
treat
the
name
seemed
appropriate
and
im
tempted
to
drain
pour
the
second
glass
belgian
style
but
not
belgian
alcohol
isnt
hidden
at
all
and
doesnt
meld
well
with
the
beer
i
get
a
raw
alcohol
aftertaste
that
is
turning
my
stomach
its
almost
vodka
like
in
its
intensity
i
refuse
to
endure
a
beer
on
christmas
this
one
is
going
byebye
nose
is
good
initial
taste
is
good
then
ick
not
much
to
look
at
and
the
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
do
much
a
harsh
review
for
avery
im
afraid
ive
enjoyed
others
but
this
one
is
just
wrong
and
it
is
really
just
the
aftertaste
awfully
pale
in
color
but
it
pours
with
just
enough
of
a
head
to
be
able
to
keep
a
stringy
lace
flowing
around
the
glass
im
a
lace
fan
the
hops
are
very
sweet
with
bits
of
honey
and
very
ripe
tangerines
hints
of
candylike
spices
and
dried
fruit
sneak
through
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
it
was
very
a
sweet
beer
that
is
light
on
the
taste
buds
but
full
of
flavors
this
belgium
style
goden
ale
is
very
good
it
pjored
a
medium
deep
golden
yellow
with
no
foam
or
lace
the
smell
and
taste
were
both
of
spices
hops
and
a
mild
fruitiness
not
over
powering
but
pleasant
to
the
palate
the
only
place
i
could
find
this
avery

was

771
beautiful
clear
true
amber
body
that
catches
the
light
wonderfully
and
seems
to
actively
glow
the
head
is
smaller
and
fades
more
quickly
than
id
like
considering
the
style
but
i
cant
take
off
too
much
for
that
very
ripe
stone
fruit
and
clove
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
dry
one
sip
and
sweet
the
next
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
dry
hay
in
the
malt
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
is
felt
but
it
doesnt
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
every
once
in
a
while
i
get
a
wish
of
sour

but
its
not
strong
and
not
always
there
poured
a
rich
goldencaramel
color
with
about
a
finger
of
head
from
a
22oz
bottle
had
some
carbonation
it
had
an
average
smell
with
spice
overtones
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
very
creamy
and
went
down
very
smooth
the
drinkability
was
also
excellent
youve
want
to
drink
several
but
the
9
abv
will
slow
you
down
some
another
great
beer
from
avery
a
thick
and
chewy
beer
that
has
an
almost
barleywine
like
quality
a
belgian
barleywine
as
eric
cartman
would
say
sweeeet
bright
dark
yellow
in
color
a
very
thin
yet
capped
off
white

decent
carbonation
belgium
spices
some
malts

grace
the
nose
very
sweet
thick
and
crisp

up

spicy
great
hop
bite
some
floral
and
citrus
notes
as
well
the
body
is
very
sweet
cotton
candy
and
sugary
offerings
very
smooth
well
rounded
and
crisp
yeastlike
characteristics
are
formed
in
the
middle
of
this
beverage
but
the
hops
seem
a
bit
more
up
front
hints
of
alcohol
are
followed
by
a
decent
bellywarming
effect
this
beer
was
pretty
good
may
rank
low
in
its
class
of
belgian
spas
yet
that
class
is
already
stacked
pretty
well
the
salvation
should
be
enjoyed
by
most
this
is
not
my
favorite
brew
from
avery
but
it
will
help
to
pass
the
night
in
a
storm
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
head
and
little
lacing
it
has
a
pleasant
aroma
of
maltiness
with
hints
of
clove
anise
and
pineapple
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
most
belgians
of
this
variety
it
is
remindful
of
sugar
and
cinnamon
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
sweetness
is
evocative
of
the
malt
but
there
isnt
a
big
malt
flavor
little
hops
bitterness
perhaps
a
little
more
would
have
balanced
this
and
made
it
more
drinkable
after
a
bomber
of
it
i
was
looking
for
a
big
ipa
to
pucker
the
mouth
a
little
i
like
salvation
but
the
reverend
and
the
beast
drinkability
nah
ill
pass
some
interesting
and
appealing
moments
but
unless
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
storage
i
wouldnt
pursue
it
again
this
was
medium
bodied
and
was
quite
flat
very
little
carbonation
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
dry
grainy
finish
the
citrus
lingered
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
was
a
little
to
strong
on
the
citrus
tones
which
cuts
back
the
drinkability
clear
tawny
gold
in
hue
there
was
no
animation
it
looked
dull
aside
from
a
few
random
floatingsuspended
yeasties
the
head
almost
reached
a
finger
in
height
before
subsiding
to
a
foamy
loose
cap
the
retention
of
the
cap
was
fantastic
as
it
lasted
throughout
the
entire
consumption
subsequent
lacing
was
patchy
but
prevalent
the
nose
has
decent
potency
it
is
strong
enough
to
get
its
point
across
i
really
like
the
fruitiness
it
is
peachy
and
a
little
lemony
juicy
like
a
starburst
the
malt
shines
it
bready
and
definitely
belgian
but
i
swear
it
had
an
english
suggestion
without
question
the
loudest
feature
of
the
nose
is
the
candied
sugar
sweetness
which
intermingles
ideally
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
nose
is
subdued
and
quite
pleasant
inviting
at
room
temperature
the
complexities
are
fully
bloomed
fantastic
the
alcohol
on
the
palate
stands
stark
naked
thumbing
its
nose
at
any
sense
of
mellow
wellcrafted
flavors
the
candied
sugar
also
runs
buck
wild
which
fueled
the
alcohol
im
sure
the
sweetness
is
stiff
and
raw
it
is
reminiscent
of
alcoholic
sugar
water
the
peachy
and
banana
fruitiness
cant
find
a
home
i
can
taste
it
but
i
cant
place
it
it
works
in
harmony
with
the
sweetness
and
it
tries
to
stand
up
to
the
alcohol
tries
is
the
key
word
the
malt
does
find
a
home
towards
the
finish
it
is
lovely
very
bready
with
a
kiss
of
biscuit
like
an
epa
but
dont
get
me
wrong
with
is
a
powerful
belgian
golden
ale
id
like
a
more
noticeable
hoppiness
and
less
sweetness
this
beer
is
damn
good
as
is
but
examples
like
unibroue
11
or
even
duvel
blow
salvation
out
of
the
water
they
are
just
better
crafted
averys
example
is
complex
but
forceful
in
other
words
it
has
been
americanized
the
more
i
quaffed
the
more
the
hops
were
seen
still
i
need
more
also
the
yeast
characteristics
grew
too
green
apples
and
distant
hints
of
vanilla
as
well
no
matter
how
soft
the
flavors
got
this
was
still
a
little
too
brutish
but
it
grew
on
me
sometimes
i
like
it
rough
full
bodied
low
but
natural
carbonation
helps
create
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
even
at
9
abv
and
even
thought
it
is
poorly
hidden
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
sip
savor
repeat
until
there
is
no
more
liquid
i
purchased
a
22ounce
bottle
in
loveland
co
i
should
have
bought
more
a
good
if
not
great
tripel
some
nice
sweetness
and
coriander
spicing
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
present
in
the
beer
id
have
it
again
if
i
saw
it
around
but
wouldnt
really
actively
seek
it
out
it
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
it
is
just
a
bit
too
dominating
a
brew
to
really
be
drinkable
more
like
sipable
for
dessert
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
bronzish
orange
color
the
head
was
white
in
color
but
quite
weak
moderate
lacing
along
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
nice
fruity
sweet
and
bready
the
taste
was
very
sweet
upfront
i
noticed
a
strong
honey
flavor
initially
then
a
peach
fruit
sweetness
yeasty
base
was
light
and
airy
hops
are
quite
prevalent
towards
the
end
which
is
odd
for
a
belgian
but
the
hop
bitterness
was
quite
good
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
cloying
but
the
hop
bite
threw
that
off
finish
is
dry
and
smooth
this
beer
is
lighter
in
body
and
easy
drinking
but
i
probably
couldnt
have
too
many
because
of
the
sweetness
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
zum
wohl
it
pours
a
glowing
clear
orangegold
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
the
head
is
lacking
but
the
lovely
color
makes
up
for
it
there
is
candy
sugar
malty
grains
a
spiciness
and
citrus
in
the
aroma
fruity
esters
jump
out
at
first
in
the
taste
the
body
is
coating
though
not
quite
syruppy
but
almost
oily
slick
there
is
also
some
yeastiness
and
a
light
spritzy
carbonation
the
finish
is
lightly
spicy
styrian
goldings
are
evident
and
the
alcohol
rears
its
head
a
dangerously
delicious
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
my
neighborhood
pub
overall
a
good
american
representation
of
a
belgian
trippel
color
a
light
honey
amber
with
a
creamy
whiteishbeige
foam
head
nice
clarity
and
lacing
in
the
glass
aroma
notes
of
almond
amaretto
and
cloves
taste
of
spicy
anise
and
bannas
with
a
subtle
hint
of
alchohol
lingering
at
the
finish
body
felt
a
bit
thin
and
this
seemed
to
affect
the
clarity
of
the
flavor
throughout
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
felt
that
it
offered
good
qualtiy
drinkablity
for
the
style

months

is
a

balance
of

and
the
spices
with
a
little
fruitiness
and
that
noticable
high
abv
kick
mouthfeel
is
distinctly
better
than
average
and
drinkability
is
acceptable
on
the
whole
this
is
a
fairly
unique
beer
definitely
worth
trying
and
one
id
like
to
keep
around
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
it
drinkability

this
was
an
exciting
ale
and
definitely
closed
the
night
for
me
its
a
wallop
and
a
half
full
of
bspa
flavors
and
spices
and
very
satisfying
22

along
with
plenty

thick

breadiness
and
a
whallop
of

taste

the

lend
a

to
the

sweetness
at
room
temperature
this
ale
becomes
very
nicely
balanced
both
in
taste
and
aroma
overall
an
excellent
belgian
style
ale
from
the
folks
at
avery
a
dark
golden
ale
that
pours
quite
clear
with
just
a
bit
of
foam
that
settles
nicely
into
cloudlike
arrangements
of
bubbles
fruity
nose
mixed
with
a
bit
a
cooked
corn
dms
aroma
the
latter
is
not
a
good
thing
smooth
mouthfeel
starts
with
a
bit
of
bland
maltiness
but
then
gets
more
interesting
as
it
goes
on
with
fruiter
flavors
and
then
a
burst
of
hops
mixed
with
a
sugary
sweetness
towards
the
finish
perceptibly
strong
i
like
the
bitter
finish
could
be
a
little
more
complex
up
front
but
the
finish
is
very
long
bitter
and
laced
with
alcohol
finish
is
almost
a
bit
harsh
not
mind
blowing
but
pretty
tasty
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
this
is
a
beautiful
golden
slightly
hazy
ale
with
a
white
creamy
head
head
dies
down
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
layer
of
foam
with
subtle
retention
aroma
is
really
hoppy
that
was
unexpected
by
me
very
fruity
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
peaches
in
sugar
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
slightly
syrupy
flavor
is
really
nice
but
a
tad
sweet
i
like
the
sweet
though
and
the
fruitiness
seems
to
be
hanging
on
to
a
nice
malty
bottom
this
was
one
of
those
surprises
that
you
find
in
beers
sometimes
not
what
i
expected
but
quite
a
pleasure
none
the
less
a
hazy
golden
brew
that
is
quite
carbonated
crowned
by
a
cream
colored
head
smells
of
alcohols
and
esters
a
sharp
aroma
mixed
with
a
musty
fruity
character
soft
tasting
fairly
mellow
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
is
detectable
along
with
a
slight
mustiness
as
well
the
beer
is
fruity
with
notes
of
apple
maybe
a
hint
of
apricot
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sharp
edge
here
too
a
combination
of
the
carbonation
and
fermentation
byproducts
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
though
it
is
a
bit
on
the
thickbodied

drinkability
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
this
is
not
a
piraat
la

or

its
decently
tasty
anyway
you
slice
it
just
lacking

smell
tangerine
apricot

through
in

this
beer
shows
more

than
more
traditional
belgian
goldens
interpret
very
loosely
pale
malts
peach
apricot
and
a
hint
of
orange
are
the
governing
flavors
of
this
ale
there
is
definitely
a
sweetness
imparted
by
candi
sugar
also
there
is
a
very
pleasant
spiciness
imparted
by
the
hops
the
beer
is
rather
thick
and
lacks
an
effervescence
and
crispness
that
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
closer
to
a
strong
dark
ale
than
a
golden
ale
there
are
many
complexities
in
this
amazing
highly
underrated
brew
avery
consistently
puts
out
some
high
quality
brews
but
i
am
highly
impressed
with
this
offering
this
is
everything
i
am
looking
for
in
a
belgian
golden
i
find
most
to
be
highly
carbonated
with
a
thin
body
i
could
see
this
one
aging
very
nicely
as
the
hop
rate
is
a
tad
high
for
the
style
and
would
benefit
from
mellowing
a
year
or
two
another
underrated
beer
maybe
i
am
not
experienced
enough
with
the
style
to
appreciate
it
but
if
unibroue
put
out
the
same
beer
it
would
get
rated
better
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
nice
white
head
yeasty
and
spicy
and
very
smooth
sweet
but
no
sweeter
than
alot
of
others
abv
is
impossible
to
detect
another
solid

it

smoothest

have
had

very

touch

hops
are
very
prominent
floral
and

very
hoppy
for
a
belgian

but
it
seems
to
work
somehow
very
smooth
taste
hides
the

alcohol
very
well
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
sweet
easily
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
not
the
equal
of
true
ales
from
belgium
but
one
of
the
better
attempts
ive
found
from
this
side
of
the
pond
p
s
a
very
no
pun
intended
superbly
crafted
intricate
label
reminiscent
of
16th
century
illuminated
manuscripts
i
think
this
is
a
nice
enough
blonde
strong
ale
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
obvious
and
detracting
orange
in
color
with
a
thinninsh
hea
and
a
quite
attractively
designed
bottle
aroma
is
maltdominated
sweet
and
very
fruity
with
hints
of
orange
honey
and
corriander
fruit
shows
up
in
the
taste
as
well
which
is
led
by
the
flavor
of
belgian
candi
sugar
develops
a
slightly
bready
character
and
ends
with
a
mild
citric
hop
flavor
and
an
alcohol
spiciness
wellcarbonated
body
keeps
things
tingly
throughout
to
counteract
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
beer
especially
at
the
finish
which
is
slightly
dry
good
beer
but
wheres
the
yeast
why
make
a
belgianstyle
golden
without
bottle
conditioning
a
pellucid
amber
color
on
the
pour
the
head
immoderate
in
size
spumescent
in
texture
and
the
color
a
light
tan
and
as
it
vanishes
a
thick
glutinous
sheet
survives
to
conceal
the
glass
big
malt
nose
citrus
crisp
and
fresh
quite
pleasing
to
the
senses
and
the
start
thickly
sweet
malt
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
spicy
hop
bite
that
pleases
the
palate
the
acidity
moderate
to
mild
the
aftertaste
droughty
and
in
my
humble
opinion
another
winner
from
avery
pours
a
beautiful
coppery
gold
color
that
is
exceptionally
clear
the
head
is
blonde
thick
and
long
living
the
nose
is
very
fresh
and
fruity
inviting
i
am
imressed
that
this
comes
from
colorado
the
flavor
is
very
belgian
in
deed
it
is
sweet
malt
that
has
complex
and
interesting
spicy
undertones
the
hops
are
somewhat
noticeable
but
arent
the
most
intriguing
part
of
this
beer
the
flavors
are
just
bursting
from
all
directions
the
re
is
malt
and
spice
and
everything
nice
this
is
damn
near
excellent
but
not
quite
these
people
are
on
the
right
track
pours
a
gorgeous
golden
orange
color
with
a
chunky
sticky
slightly
orangeyellow
head
very
few
bubbles
can
be
seen
ascending
through
the
beer
very
inviting
nose
with
aromas
of
fruity
belgian
malt
and
spicy
hops
as
it
warmed
the
fruit
came
more
into
focus
candy
sweet
up
front
followed
by
spicy
alcohol
and
pumpkin
and
finishes
a
tiny
bit
drier
with
the
emphasis
on
peppery
hops
and
dehydrated
mango
this
was
a
pretty
bull
bodied
beer
with
a
slick
mouth
feel
and
petite
carbonation
the
alcohol
certainly
played
a
huge
part
in
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
yet
there
were
no
discouraging
retro
nasal
fumes
or
off
flavors
if
this
beer
were
distributed
in
my
area
i
would
certainly
get
it
again
thanks
to
txhops
a
very
good
offering
moderately
hard
pour
into
a
goblet
produced
a
thin
and
shortlived
head
murky
apricot
color
surpisingly
agressive
hop
aroma
more
than
expected
for
the
style
flavor
tended
to
favor
pitted
fruits
apricots
peaches
and
plums
cold
the
beer
again
displayed
a
rather
heavy
handed
hoppyness
as
the
beer
warmed
the
hops
faded
into
the
background
but
continued
to
lend
a
sharp
bitterness
to
the
finish
throughout
alcohol
became
more
prominent
with
warming
adding
a
raw
solvent
note
overall
this
struck
me
as
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
rather
than
an
attempt
at
recreation
it
seemed
the
beer
was
trying
to
do
many
things
with
the
flavor
but
none
of
them
particularly
well
id
like
to
see
this
as
an
unfiltered
beer
but
the
filtering
does
provide
for
a
nice
clean
color
of
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
fruity
with
notes
of
apricot
peach
and
a
bit
of
spice
its
quite
crisp
with
a
fine
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
fruits
and
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
with
some
spicy
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
milkywhite
head
nice
effervescence
alternating
fruity
and
hoppy
aroma
nice
tart
flavor
of
herbs
and
spices
and
hops
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
as
well
6
a
bottle
around
here
but
this
was
actually
worth
it
its
gold
with
a
fairly
thick
and
sticky
white
head
that
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
must
it
also
has
a
slight
medicinal
smell
with
noticeable
alcohol
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
its
a
bit
off
for
the
style
up
front
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
the
hops
do
kick
in
for
a
nice
little
surprise
they
didnt
seem
to
skimp
on
the
use
of
candi
sugar
and
the
taste
of
it
is
quite
pronounced
however
despite
the
lack
of
subtlety
its
an
enjoyable
drink
coolass
bottle
though
hazy
gold
with
a
smallish
white
head
theres
sweetness
up
front
in
the
nose
and
palate
that
lead
to
a
little
more
pronounced
hoppiness
than
i
expect
in
this
style
and
not
the
right
hop
flavor
at
that
as
with
this
brewers
attempt
at
a
quad
wheres
that
musty
yeasty
complexity
thats
so
identifiable
with
belgian
beers
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
enough
for
the
style
either
a
bit
disappointing
this
avery
product
seemed
more
like
a
pumpedup
alcoholwise
american
pale
ale
the
initially
thick
creamy
white
settles
into
a
thin
but
persistant
lace
laving
layer
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
honey
like
sweetness
upfront
and
in
ensued
by
phenol
and
solvent
like
fusels
and
an
odd
hint
of
acetone
sweet
and
slightly
cidery
in
flavor
w
peppery
alcohol
flavors
and
clove
thinly
bodied
and
almost
dry
from
the
high
apparent
attenuation
copious
use
of
light
candi
sugar
or
dextrose
is
quite
evident
in
the
very
warming
alcoholic
finish
although
a
decent
brew
salvation
seemed
a
bit
rough
lacking
the
deceiving
smoothness
and
complexity
of
other
strong
goldens
that
acetone
nail
polish
note
in
the
aroma
is
a
bit
offputting
although
im
a
bit
dissapointed
i
will
gladly
finish
the
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
copperish
golden
color
formed
a
very
light
white
head
which
left
some
nice
lace
slight
citrus
and
malt
aroma
to
it
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
alot
of
carbonation
which
is
common
for
this
style
taste
was
of
light
citrus
and
malt
with
some
alcohol
present
not
the
best
representation
of
this
style
ok
this
belgian
stong
golden
would
never
be
mistaken
for
a
true
belgian
but
it
has
great
flavor
none
the
less
slightly
fruity
good
malt
flavor
appripriate
alcohol
intensity
but
just
a
little
too
much
goldings
the
hop
flavor
is
nice
and
works
well
with
the
beer
over
all
but
if
they
were
going
for
a
true
belgian
style
i
think
they
went
just
a
tad
too
far
i
found
myself
going
back
for
more
more
than
once
and
it
is
definately
a
worthy
beer
perfect
beer
tastes
great
love
it
favorite
of
the
style
comparable
to
duvel
but
slightly
better
in
tastenot
as
carbonated
coriander
is
subtle
but
evident
o
i
had
forgotten
how
grand
la
chouffe
was
boy
am
i
glad
its
showing
up
in
my
area
these
days
an
excellent
belgian
ale
and
a
pure
traditional
belgian
classic
ranking
up
there
with
the
great
brewers
of
that
part
of
the
world
a
must
try
and
it
remains
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
love
it
its
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
and
doesnt
feel
like
a
beer
with
8
abv
if
i
could
marry
this
beer
i
would
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
go
back
for
more
gran
ejemplo
del
estilo
es
una
cerveza
visualmente
muy
atractiva
y
con
un
aroma
complejo
y
lleno
de
frescura
con
la
marca
de
la
levadura
belga
fácil
de
beber
y
placentera
no
se
nota
el
grado
y
tiene
un
paladar
limpio
y
seco
con
gran
repertorio
de
especias
y
frutas
verdes
y
maduras
to
start
la
chouffe
is
simply
one
of
the
tastiest
looking
belgian
ales
the
initial
pour
yields
a
big
inviting
pure
white
head
and
a
hazy
nearopaque
caramelorange
body
the
smell
is
very
nice
dry
caramel
fruity
belgian
esthers
although
perhaps
the
aroma
isnt
as
forthright
on
draught
as
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
the
taste
is
magic
though
full
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
and
just
enough
hop
bite
its
really
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
i
sometime
think
of
la
chouffe
as
a
perfect
foil
to
duvel
a
much
softer
rounder
lessintense
belgian
ale
that
nonetheless
brings
a
perfect
balance
of
flavor
its
more
playful
and
sweetly
bodied
than
some
belgian
ales
but
definitely
a
serious
contender
i
dont
think
ill
ever
get
tired
of
drinking
it
one
of
my
favorites
especially
in
the
cooler
months
great
beer
repeating
this
one
not
one
of
the
best
belgium
goldens
but
right
up
there
overall
world
class
beer
those
belgians
know
how
to
do
it
literally
pair
this
with
anything
fancy
from
lobster
to
caviar
or
cheap
nice
slice
of
pepperoni
pizza
i
give
it
a
97
5100
quite
possibly
my
favorite
of
all
beers
enjoy
although
this
beer
has
8
abv
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
aromatic
and
a
bit
boring
very
solid
strong
beer
with
not
much
kick
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
not
bad
though
mooie
kleur
en
geur
maar
smaak
valt
tegen
one
of
the
classics
i
think
this
basically
defines
the
genre
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
has
all
the
elements
and
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
beers
in
this
style
thats
out
there
a
little
darker
than
golden
bright
russet
colored
with
a
tall
white
head
that
is
vintage
belgian
the
nose
is
a
showcase
of
this
very
dynamic
yeast
as
spice
laden
as
it
is
fruity
and
then
bittering
hops
with
a
european
grassiness
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
with
a
little
grain
sweetness
on
the
front
end
before
the
yeast
driven
dry
finish
carbonation
is
akin
to
champagne
and
the
beer
is
awfully
drinkable
and
creamy
for
something
thats
8
abv
very
uncommon
i
kind
of
always
keep
this
beer
in
the
back
of
my
mind
and
internally
compare
all
other
belgian
pales
to
it
very
few
stack
up
to
la
chouffe
smooth
and
well
made
light
and
delicious
wont
bother
with
a
full
review
as
that
would
waste
time
the
finish
here
was
so
sweet
it
just
reminded
me
of
bubblegum
i
mean
that
literally
i
got
notes
of
bazooka
joe
and
dubble
bubble
here
matter
of
fact
the
nose
and
taste
were
absurdly
sweet
as
well
if
you
like
sweet
yeasty
belgians
you
will
love
this
but
personally
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
full
of
bananas
with
some
bread
scents
coming
out
too
the
taste
is
light
and
aromatic
like
champagne
with
banana
and
apple
being
in
the
front
and
then
toasted
biscuits
and
a
little
bit
of
toffee
coming
in
the
end
very
pleasant
and
a
wonderful
beer
lovely
beer
some
biscuit
and
bread
along
with
some
banana
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
like
a
meal
onto
itself
not
a
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summerday
to
cool
off
better
for
warming
up
in
cold
weather
with
a
hearty
meal
or
chocolates
i
love
belgian
beers
so
much
the
taste
is
throughout
great
from
the
beginning
there
is
an
intense
taste
of
wheat
which
leads
to
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
fresh
hoppy
ending
some
peppers
add
a
necessary
contrast
to
the
beer
otherwise
it
might
be
too
mild
slight
hints
of
berries
going
along
with
the
upcoming
bitterness
in
the
end
giving
the
beer
a
generous
complxity
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
that
elf
complex
yet
not
overwhelming
a
truly
pleasant
sipper
that
morphs
as
it
warms
belies
its
abv
a
true
global
gem
love
it
paired
with
hearty
and
spicy
food
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
lots
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
but
still
quite
approachable
definitely
a
sipper
i
avoided
this
beer
unintentionally
for
quite
some
time
but
will
no
longer
do
so
a
truly
well
crafted
brew
paired
well
with
a
big
pot
of
mussels

a
new
favorite
for
me
poured
a
lovely
gold
with
a
rich
white
head
aroma
and
taste
are
great
with
fruit
and
spices
overall
the
first
time
i
drank
this
in
2012
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
but
two
years
later
when
i
came
to
review
it
i
found
that
it
had
a
lot
of
flavour
and
real
depth
to
it
cloudy
against
the
light
with
tiny
hints
of
matter
like
clouds
floating
in
the
glass
this
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
fairly
typical
in
appearance
for
a
belgium
blond
although
it
may
be
cloudier
than
most
im
used
to
to
put
it
another
way
it
is
golden
like
an
english
sunrise
over
the
isle
of
purbeck
in
midjuly
with
noticeable
clouds
that
promise
a
very
good
day
in
some
ways
it
resembles
a
wheat
beer
a
cracking
beer
that
i
like
very
much
expectation
to
see
if
you
purchase
a
bottle
of
750
ml
but
appearance
fun
label
the
glass
cloudy
with
ingredients
in

would

be

are
there

maybe
im

im

this
isnt

its
quite
nice

probably
a

these
gnomes
know
what
theyre
doing
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
the
houblon
chouffe
but
this
seems
pretty
similar
which
is
a
good
thing
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
o
definitely
recommended
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
verdict
a
benchmark
for
the
style
and
a
really
wonderful
beer
to
drink
its
not
overly
complex
or
inventive
but
refined
and
executed
impeccably
its
quite
refreshing
for
the
abv
and
one
of
the
more
quaffable
belgian
pale
strong
ales
one
can
find
prost
o
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
can
see
why
this
is
such
a
staple
at
so
many
bars
around
my
parts
nice
and
easy
to
drink
i
found
this
beer
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
smell
of
this
beer
and
i
found
it
really
added
a
great
deal
to
the
experience
overall
a
brilliant
belgian
strong
i
have
seen
this
at
dan
murphys
for
a
long
time
and
assumed
from
a
distance
that
it
was
a
cider
im
glad
i
bothered
to
take
a
closer
look
one
of
the
best
balanced
and
most
refreshing
belgian
strong
pale
ales
i
have
had
to
date
o
solid
beer
spice
and
tart
aftertaste
and
complex
flavors
overall
what
an
awesome
beer
the
depth
of
the
spice
and
yeast
esters
is
amazing
and
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
definitely
one
to
seek
out
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
perfectly
dry
and
crisp
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
good
and
textbook
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
nothing
seemed
out
of
place
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
very
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
prickly
carbonation
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
i
thought
they
were
both
very
nice
and
they
were
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
the
head
retention
and
lacing
were
a
little
weak
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
good
but
its
a
little
pricey
and
for
around
the
same
price
i
can
get
duvel
which
i
like
more
than
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
belgian
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
satisfied
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
i
still
thought
it
was
good
and
ill
be
on
a
look
out
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
since
this
beer
made
for
a
good
first
impression
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
really
nice
great
beer
my
favorite
beers
are
the
strong
sweet
dark
belgians
st
bernardus
gouden
caroulus
van
de
kaiser
blau
on
tap
gulden
draak
etcbut
this
beer
is
up
pretty
high
on
my
list
even
though
it
is
not
a
dark
i
wish
it
finished
without
any
bitterness
at
all
this
has
a
stout
long
lasting
8
alcohol
effect
on
me
feels
more
like
13
to
me
i
will
probably
be
buying
this
again
and
may
try
aging
this
4
pack
of
330
bottle

99
at
tw
from
my
tasting
notes
the
la
chouffe
was
a
strong
golden
ale
in
the
vein
of
duvel
that
came
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
notes
in
the
aroma
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
that
was
herbal
and
spicy
while
being
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
their
flagship
beer
and
it
was
very
tasty
definitely
one
to
revisit
overall
solid
to
very
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgians
and
specifically
golden
ales
you
should
give
this
a
try
or
if
youre
new
to
these
styles
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
rjt
o
the
brasserie
dachouffe
and
its
gnome
have
never
let
me
down
gotta
love
this
beer
and
these
guys
o
it
reminds
me
of
duvel
a
nice
beer
d
awesome
brew
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
which
wont
effect
the
score
one
iota
this
is
a
kick
ass
melange
like
ive
never
experienced
elements
of
triple
witbier
and
golden
very
happy
i
tried
this
one
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
again
would
get
it
again
would
recommend
it
to
others
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
me
to
bring
to
a
nice
restaurant
its
beautiful
refreshing
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
full
meal
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
normally
this
is
a
style
i
very
much
like
but
the
aroma
turned
me
off
quite
a
bit
and
the
heavy
finish
left
this
beer
a
bit
less
sessionable
still
its
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
if
i
could
be
assured
it
wasnt
lightstruck
somehow
o
overall
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
especially
in
the
warmer
months
if
you
like
your
triples
a
bit
sweeter
this
is
the
way
to
go
pretty
easily
available
too
just
one
of
the
more
pricey
triples
as
far
as
the
commonly
sold
ones
go
o
this
beer
is
decent
but
it
really
didnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
i
like
in
belgian
strongs
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
another
one
for
the
price
i
paid
la
chouffe
is
just
a
great
allaround
belgian
pale
i
wish
id
tried
it
sooner
flavor
and
aroma
didnt
really
wow
me
but
its
solid
allaround
and
available
in
4packs
of
330ml
im
really
diggin
this
brew
wonderful
balance
clean
finish
the
high
abv
was
not
evident
refreshing
an
allseason
ale
i
could
enjoy
by
the
fire
in
december
or
on
the
deck
in
july
once
again
i
will
have
to
rearrange
my
top
5
to
include
la
chouffe
overall
great
beer
the
smell
is
an
enticing
mix
of
fruit
and
yeast
its
very
drinkable
for
8
a
complex
and
enjoyable
belgian
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
any
situation
ive
had
it
on
tap
in
amsterdam
for
my
first
experience
but
honestly
i
almost
like
it
out
of
the
bottle
better
maybe
thats
an
unfair
assesment
as
i
havent
had
it
on
tap
in
years
but
regardless
this
beer
will
amaze
anyone
its
so
drinkable
that
this
could
convert
even
non
beer
drinkers
into
avid
beer
snobs
if
you
love
delirium
or
duvel
you
need
to
give
this
a
shot
youll
probably
like
it
even
better
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
certainly
something
ill
see
again
down
the
road
but
nothing
that
knocked
my
socks
off
what
a
wonderful
beer
o
very
nice
id
like
to
do
a
bpa
abing
sometime
the
flavor
is
crisp
bright
with
a
clear
estery
finish
that
showcases
some
noticeable
straw
notes
sweetly
dry
this
was
enjoyable
a
very
satisfying
brew
an
instant
goto
brew
for
the
style
this
was
a
gift
and
my
first
from
brasserie
dachouffe
but
i
am
definitely
impressed
with
this
brew
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
was
a
little
bit
different
than
i
was
expecting
some
nice
fruity
notes
and
some
spice
to
balance
it
out
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
750ml
of
this
in
one
night
though
its
a
touch
sweet
o
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
very
enjoyable
everything
from
the
caramel
flavors
to
the
spiciness
was
a
journey
the
alcohol
would
pop
up
from
time
to
time
which
isnt
preferable
but
there
was
enough
going
on
that
it
didnt
detract
much
from
the
experience
belgian
beer
lovers
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
seeking
it
out
o
this
beer
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
it
can
hold
its
head
up
with
the
best
of
the
breed
it
isvery
clean
wellmade
and
balanced
i
consider
the
appearance
to
be
perfect
and
the
aroma
and
taste
are
nearly
so
just
lacking
in
depthcomplexity
to
make
it
the
best
of
the
best
odamn
damn
damn
this
is
enjoyable
refreshing
surprising
and
everything
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
it
was
pricey
but
worth
it
definite
revisit
in
the
summer
season
overall
nice
refreshing
beer
which
is
dangerous
considering
the
abv
not
the
best
belgium
ale
ive
had
though
just
ok
it
is
a
solid
beer
definitely
one
to
add
to
my
regular
line
up
odi
enjoyed
their
dobbelen
more
but
this
one
is
no
slouch
the
large
bottle
will
disappear
quite
quickly
balanced
and
wellcrafted
o
a
very
well
brewed
artisan
beer
has
typical
belgian
qualities
would
seem
great
in
the
summer
months
glad
to
have
tried
but
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
overall
its
a
classic
of
course
a
nearperfect
representative
of
its
style
always
a
pleasure
although
it
could
be
more
adventurous
overall
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
chouffes
it
is
still
a
quality
example
of
the
style
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
category
the
ardennes
yeast
is
less
phenolic
and
estery
than
many
other
belgian
yeast
strains
which
makes
this
much
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
oi
knew
i
loved
the
chouffe
and
this
beer
confirmed
that
for
me
subtle
aroma
perfectly
integrated
flavors
and
excellent
balance
on
the
mouth
this
a
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
and
never
get
tired
of
it
a
great
example
of
how
things
dont
need
to
be
overdone
to
be
good
o
excellent
belgian
brew
one
of
the
best
around
an
orange
beer
with
a
fantastic
light
orange
head
the
aroma
is
fantastic
it
is
malts
sweet
with
notes
of
alcohol
fruit
oranges
coriander
and
cinnamon
a
wonderful
nose
the
flavor
too
is
fantastic
it
starts
with
a
nice
malts
sweetness
containing
notes
of
oranges
fruit
coriander
cinnamon
and
alcohol
in
the
end
the
alcohol
sting
your
tongue
before
it
leaves
you
with
a
sweetness
that
lingers
on
your
tongue
and
lips
it
has
a
very
nice
palate
this
is
a
great
beer
wonderful
beer
seek
it
out
exceptionally
wellbalanced
sample
i
got
fizzed
quite
a
bit
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
not
so
much
that
i
needed
a
towel
just
had
to
pour
some
out
before
it
got
messy
aroma
is
fruity
yeasty
and
a
bit
woody
not
strong
but
still
appealing
pours
a
nice
clear
bright
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
if
none
too
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
better
and
stronger
than
what
the
aroma
promised
fruity
malty
a
little
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
must
be
butterscotch
texture
is
firmbodied
and
a
little
syrupy
fizz
is
not
strong
but
lasts
leaving
a
nice
fruity
tingly
slightly
sweet
finish
worth
ten
bucks
for
750
ml
definitely
pours
a
clear
straw
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
drops
to
a
cap
and
leaves
light
lacing
very
nice
nose
of
pepper
straw
and
hints
of
barnyard
body
has
a
fairly
strong
sweetness
at
first
that
later
gets
overpowered
by
earthy
hop
nice
amount
of
pepper
with
notes
of
apple
juice
overall
a
fine
beer
worth
drinking
more
of
o
pretty
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
abv
sure
sneaked
up
on
me
after
2
bottles
lightly
sweet
with
a
pepper
kicker
in
the
swallow
rich
body
with
an
above
average
carbonation
in
a
word
smooth
creamy
finish
with
a
touch
alcohol
showing
up
in
the
swallow
very
complex
i
can
imagine
a
belgian
farmer
making
this
his
nightly
drink
its
suggests
to
me
so
strongly
of
being
made
on
a
farm
its
earthy
spicy
and
approachable
its
something
i
could
have
nightly
but
not
more
than
a
glass
where
duvel
is
delicate
and
complex
la
chouffe
comes
across
as
strong
and
proud
rigid
in
its
strengths
id
want
this
after
a
hard
days
work
in
the
yard
great
stuff
o
i
hate
coriander
but
it
seems
like
a
pretty
sound
beer
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
because
of
the
term
brewed
with
spice
that
term
can
mean
an
infinite
amount
of
stupendous
and
horrendous
things
too
loose
a
term
for
me
to
confidently
purchase
but
this
beer
kick
ass
cheers
330

with

some
others
that
i
cant
really
tell

some
that
i
cant
tell
including
kind
of
some
fermented
fruit
and
a
lemon
touch
dry
and

it
taste
like
if
it

some
more
alcohol

is
just
a
bad
bottle
overall
i
always
let
this
beer
slide
because
i
buy
and

dobblen
so
much
but
this
one
is
just
as
much
fun
and

bought
a

of
this

poured
into

thick
thick

strong
hops
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
other

members
in
this
the
flavor
was
a
bit
sour
in
areas
where
i
dont
think
it
was
trying
to
be
sour
but
overall
this
was
a
beautiful
strong
belgian
pale
the
gnome
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
is
cute
too
and
definitely
adds
to
the
advertising
when
most
beer
is
trying
to
be
intimidating
o
well
rounded
pleasant
and
drinkable
brew
excellent
companion
with
food
like
barbque
chicken
or
white
fish
and
well
as
vegetarian
and
soft
cheese
also
enjoyable
on
its
own
definitely
worth
the
try
i
could
see
getting
to
be
good
friends
with
the
gnome
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
reputation

it

overall
good
but
not
complex
enough
to
be
great
good
drinkability
very
good
beer
overall
o
with
out
a
doubt
one
of
my
favourite
belgium
ales
with
all
its
qualities
shining
through
a
wondeful
well
balanced
complex
beer
that
is
a
must
to
try
awesome
beer
dont
know
why
i
havent
tried
this
before
the
taste
isnt
overpowering
but
still
quite
flavorful
and
refreshing
look
forward
to
drinking
a
few
of
these
when
it
gets
hot
out
it
doesnt
seem
possible
to
pour
a
second
glass
from
a
750
chouffe
bottle
without
it
getting
filled
with
sediment
the
texture
is
5
stars
creamy
smooth
with
little
bubbles
setting
up
to
complement
some
easy
jazz
my
first
recommendation
would
be
the
early
1960s
jimmy
giuffre
3
miles
davis
kind
of
blue
era
would
be
a
2nd
choice
or
even

pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
fruits
spices
yeast
and
some
slight
banana
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
spice
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
was
very
subtle
for
an
8
beer
o
pretty
darn
good
for
the
style
o
alcohol
like
most
good
belgians
is
very
wellhidden
classic
belgian
pale
profile
very
smooth
and
tasty
but
nothing
jumps
out
as
extremely
special
doa
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
isnt
my
style
but
damn
its
good
a
great
example
of
an
ok
style
overall
not
sure
what
was
up
witht
this
keg
but
this
was
not
a
good
beer
tasted
old
undercarbonated
underattenuated
and
maybe
even
infected
lots
of
offflavours
and
roughness
not
good
overall
i
was
expecting
more
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
la
chouffe
but
i
thought
it
would
have
more
body
and
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
are
they
tuning
this
to
the
chinese
palate
ill
try
it
again
once
i
return
to
the
states
but
this
experience
was
mediocre
two
finger
frothy
head
on
a
dark
golden
hazy
body
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
excellent
with
a
distinct
musty
floral
note
with
a
fruity
background
taste
is
also
on
the
floral
side
the
coriander
is
robust
in
the
one
with
a
semi
sweet
fruit
flavor
as
well
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
get
it
again
overall
this
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
i
hope
to
revisit
in
the
future
well
balanced
in
every
aspect
overall
i
love
how
these
beers
are
typically
unpasteurized
and
unfiltered
definitely
my
favorite
thing
about
achouffes
products
after
drinking
so
many
belgian
beers
blondes
and
quads
alike
this
happens
to
score
pretty
low
for
me
unfortunately
there
are
certainly
a
dozen
or
more
blonde
ales
that
are
far
more
complex
and
superior
however
this
is
still
a
delicious
treat
from
time
to
time
no
question
about
that
solid
feel
and
drnk
i
really
loved
it
o
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ales
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
sometime
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
and
have
a
chance
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
a
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
one
id
enjoy
again
easily
likable
and
easily
drinkable
dont
think
i
like
the
belgian
pales
quite
as
much
as
their
dark
cousins
but
a
a
good
beer
none
the
less
la
chouffe
isnt
as
available
as
duvel
but
if
you
can
find
it
it
is
highly
rewarding
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
interested
in
belgians
one
of
my
top
five
favorite
belgians
and
i
have
had
all
of
them
the
taste
follows
suit
grassy
earthy
a
little
oil
on
the
tongue
but
pretty
dry
very
spritey
hop
bitterness
overtones
of
yeast
some
citrus
a
full
feel
to
the
beer
lovely
pale
malt
flavor
zero
roasted
malt
or
caramel
flavor
here
just
a
perfectly
developed
pale
malt
ale
excellent
duvel
is
my
favoriate
bspa
but
this
offers
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
and
yeasty
heft
while
maintaining
a
crispy
dry
profile
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent
bspa
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
example
of
the
style
but
definitely
a
smooth
tasty
enjoyable
one
nonetheless
i
like
duvel
marginally
more
but
realistically
id
put
the
two
brews
on
very
similar
footing
la
chouffes
big
bottle
makes
it
better
for
splitting
with
friends
though
i
can
only
ever
find
those
stubby
duvel
bottles
great
stuff
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
taste
is
quite
spicy
and
a
bit
sharp
theres
a
very
strong
hop
bite
as
well
not
overwhelming
but
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
given
i
have
a
liter
and
a
half
to
drink
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
full
body
lots
of
carbonation
as
well
o
a
fantastic
example
of
a
style
not
seen
enough
in
my
opinion
its
truly
belgian
with
a
pale
ale
qualities
rounding
it
out
a
must
for
any
beer
advocate
o
quite
good
belgian
pale
ale
would
definitely
buy
again
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
strong
flavors
and
aromas
figured
id
give
the
stores
last
bottle
of
this
a
good
home
mine
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
gold
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
heavy
belgian
yeast
light
white
bread
clove
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
light
lemon
peel
a
hint
of
banana
peel
and
a
touch
of
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
that
heavy
yeast
character
really
coming
to
the
fore
this
isnt
to
say
that
the
spices
take
a
full
backseat
but
they
are
definitely
subservient
to
the
yeast
lesser
beers
would
suffer
from
this
situation
but
this
yeast
works
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bspa
not
quite
up
there
with
duvel
and
the
other
standardbearers
but
it
comes
pretty
dern
close
this
is
a
greta
brew
that
would
pass
for
a
spectacular
hefe
really
could
drink
this
all
day
a
real
pleasant
surprise
i
think
it
has
been
know
to
cure
the
common
cold
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
an
off
white
head
excellent
carbonation
and
super
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
glass
somewhat
cloudy
but
not
completely
you
can
still
see
the
other
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
fairly
fantastic
malt
yeast
spices
tiny
bit
of
farm
smell
really
smooth
and
very
well
put
together
excellent
taste
is
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
with
some
fruit
flavors
in
there
im
mainly
getting
pear
very
nice
and
smooth
an
easy
drinker
none
of
the
8
abv
shows
itself
in
the
taste
at
all
feel
is
medium
w
a
fruitspice
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
cheers
o
very
good
bspa
that
i
would
highly
recommend
it
looks
like
a
light
golden
slightly
clouded
ale
and
keeps
a
strong
head
on
tap
at
the
encinitas
ale
house
overall
a
very
nice
dinner
beer
belgain
style
o
this
is
a
well
made
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
an
interesting
herbal
and
yeasty

and

very
creamy
rich
and
complex
flavor
that
doesnt
add
up
with
the
abv
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
id
like
to
try
this
again
with
a
different
food
pairing
i
had
baked
chicken
rice
steamed
vegetables
o
a
great
sipper
from
cold
to
room
temp
will
definitely
have
this
again
o
a
great
brew
really
enjoyed
my
first
foray
into
this
brewery
really
a
nice
golden
so
smooth
and
nicely
sweet
which
is
not
what
i
had
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
fine
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
high
alcohol
not
so
noticeable
o
its
good
but
its
not
my
fave
belgian
pale
at
all
o
enjoyable
blond
ale
while
this
is
slightly
spicier
than
i
remember
it
being
on
tap
it
is
still
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
ale
belgian
golden
ale
as
the
bottle
claims
this
is
and
not
a
bspa
is
a
style
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
and
is
one
that
ive
been
nervous
about
getting
to
learn
about
since
belgian
ales
generally
have
an
air
of
the
mysterious
to
them
this
is
a
tasty
bga
though
and
you
should
try
if
you
can
find
it
o
a
disappointment
i
have
promised
myself
never
be
trapped
again
by
the
look
of
the
little
hobbit
unless
it
is
the
great
houblon
chouffe
0
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
worth
a
try
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
very
easy
to
drink
because
it
tastes
so
good
the
mouth
starts
with
a
mouth
of
carbonation
iit
becomes
malty
sweet
and
the
belgian
yeasts
comes
and
drys
the
palet
and
makes
a
slight
bitter
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
beer
what
a
delicious
brew
i
am
so
glad
that
i
revisited
la
chouffe
i
will
make
a
point
to
have
this
around
and
enjoy
it
more
often
poured
a
golden
brown
with
a
huge
dense
white
head
persistent
and
creamy
with
a
great
thickness
exceptional
lace
even
considering
the
serving
vessel
nose
has
some
light
pear
and
green
apple
in
restraint
sweet
malts
overshadow
some
subdued
spicy
and
pepper
like
qualities
taste
is
sweet
with
some
mild
caramellike
qualities
peppery
notes
are
enhanced
by
a
vibrant
carbonation
which
is
active
but
not
overpowering
hints
of
alcohol
and
some
mild
herbal
qualities
eurohops
surely
but
i
cant
decipher
them
good
warmth
from
the
alcohol
with
a
medium
heavy
feel
a
solid
belgian
strong
sharing
this
was
the
best
option
however
o
very
enjoyable
a
perfect
evening
sipper
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
effect
drank
this
really
good
belgian
strong
ale
at
sapsuckers
in
huntington
ny
they
served
this
ale
in
a
brandy
snifter
glass
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
it
has
notes
of
raisins
caramel
and
spices
on
the
nose
once
it
hits
the
mouth
the
creamy
tastes
of
raisins
and
plums
leave
a
clean
finish
this
brew
poured
out
with
a
nice
golden
color
the
head
was
thick
and
white
the
lacing
was
minimal
but
had
a
decent
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
slightly
sweet
some
grains
on
the
nose
and
plenty
of
earthy
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
nicely
balanced
grains
and
malts
upfront
that
fade
into
a
more
dry
and
earthy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
would
drink
this
along
with
any
of
the
other
chouffe
brews
out
there
again
overall
a
superb
beer
and
one
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
it
hits
the
spot
for
my
sweet
yeasty
belgian
beer
jonesin
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
i
have
come
across
an
excellent
beer
poured
an
opaque
golden
yellow
color
with
two
finger
head
some
lacing
smells
of
spice
cloves
yeast
and
pears
grapes
flavor
is
of
light
fruits
and
spices
mouth
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
a
little
thick
a
great
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
lots
of
taste
and
inviting
scent
would
certainly
reach
for
this
again
and
again
better
for
a
nice
cool
fall
evening
it
had
a
very
smooth
taste
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
nicer
belgian
strong
ales
ive
had
i
look
forward
to
trying
a
few
of
dachouffes
other
beers
this
is
a
great
allweather
beer
quenching
enough
to
be
nice
on
a
patio
but
hearty
enough
to
hold
up
to
cooler
weather
an
amazing
allrounder
couldnt
recommend
this
more
if
you
see
it
drink
it
o
surprised
it
took
this
long
for
me
to
try
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
worth
seeking
out
o
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
otherwise
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
and
well
worth
the
outlay
overall
a
pretty
good
strong
blonde
ale
which
is
a
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
generally
its
worth
trying
cheers
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
with
a
creamy
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
banana
and
cloves
candi
sugar
and
some
firm
malt
fairly
classic
aromas
but
nothing
mindblowing
tastes
sharp
and
a
little
bit
sweet
up
front
then
slightly
grainy
and
quite
spicy
on
the
finish
not
very
well
integrated
so
the
flavors
dont
meld
seamlessly
like
they
do
in
the
best
strong
belgian
style
beers
fairly
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
sharpness
on
the
fore
palate
pleasant
enough
but
there
are
so
many
other
choices
id
probably
head
to
first
d
i
dont
care
for
the
drinkability
of
it
way
too
bubbly
and
the
flavor
isnt
to
my
liking
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
spices
and
subtle
alchool
smell
can
be
detected
the
taste
is
very
full
lots
of
belgin
spices
a
small
amount
of
alchool
can
be
detected
in
the
flavor
as
well
good
strong
flavor
and
very
nice
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
beer
a
must
try
o
this
was
a
great
experience
i
much
prefered
this
on
tap
vs
bottle
very
well
done
belgian
strong
pale
would
order
again
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
overall
it
was
effortless
to
sip
gave
a
really
good
pop
once
it
hit
your
palate
and
kept
itself
feeling
vibrant
throughout
the
session
the
cpj
cloudy
yelloworange
in
colour
massive
cream
coloured
head
is
tight
and
dense
well
retained
and
completely
coats
the
walls
of
my
glass
in
lace
smells
of
orchard
fruit
lemon
peel
doughy
malt
and
flowers
estery
fruit
flavour
imitates
peaches
and
bananas
theres
residual
sweetness
from
the
malt
it
has
a
nice
lemony
acidity
and
peppery
spice
and
finishes
with
a
delicate
bubblegum
flavour
medium
bodied
with
abundant
fine
carbonation
feels
velvet
and
mousselike
the
carbonation
is
champagne
like
la
chouffe
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
wellintegrated
flavours
and
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
too
it
truly
is
a
pleasure
for
all
five
senses
o
all
in
all
a
great
beer
only
i
find
the
flavours
a
bit
disconnected
almost
feels
like
pure
alcohol
was
added
after
fermentation
if
the
alcohol
and
cardboard
were
in
check
id
probably
be
in
love
with
this
beer
o
very
nice
beer
4
i
will
try
another
if
i
find
one
that
is
well
kept
o
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
belgian
strong
pale
ales
but
i
did
really
enjoy
this
one
i
can
definitely
see
myself
having
this
again
sometime
in
the
near
future
check
this
one
out
if
you
like
the
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
the
lightstruckskunky
character
it
has
a
nice
balance
between
malts
hops
and
yeast
character
that
is
complimented
well
by
a
subtle
coriander
accent
drinkability
this
is
a
great
golden
ale
lots
of
subtleties
from
the
spice
and
peppery
notes
from
the
yeast
drinkability
is
high
which
is
the
sign
of
a
well
built
beer
at
this
abv
mouthfeel
drinkability
sweet
and
full
of
blast
of
fresh
fruit
the
belgian
yeast
is
not
overpowering
which
i
like
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
light
bodied
refreshing
and
o
amazing
beer
after
returning
to
it
much
later
i
finally
appreciate
the
complex
flavor
and
composition
one
of
the
best
in
this
category
and
a
great
beer
all
around
highly
recommended
overall
i
live
in
germany
and
cant
bring
myself
to
tell
my
german
friends
that
i
think
the
belgians
just
make
better
beer
across
the
board
this
is
a
wonderful
example
if
not
my
very
favorite
bpsa
drink
overall
a
well
done
beer
the
dry
yeasty
flavor
will
keep
me
coming
back
to
this
one
overall
a
fantastic
beer
cakman2
has
talked
this
up
to
me
for
weeks
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
im
picking
up
a
bottle
next
week
d
decent
complexity
and
drinkability
though
it
appears
to
me
that
quality
and
overall
feel
have
somehow
gone
down
with
time
this
is
why
i
decided
to
edit
this
review
my
recent
tries
were
all
disappointing
if
compared
to
the
ones
i
had
years
ago
this
seems
like
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
strong
it
didnt
really
surprise
me
at
all
with
its
taste
overall
a
good
beer
but
ive
had
better
this
is
a
safe
and
mellow
bsa
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
unibrowe
makes
a
far
better
bsa
as
does
chimay
this
aint
bad
but
theres
alot
better
ones
out
there
a
good
beginner
bsa
carbonation
is
so
fine
and
rich
in
every
way
can
get
a
bit
much
after
a
full
glass
as
the
chalkiness
plus
the
bigtime
body
is
a
large
load
but
id
rather
have
this
than
a
less
flavorful
beer
drinkability
is
really
great
for
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
its
tough
to
keep
something
like
this
easy
to
drink
from
start
to
finish
but
thats
precisely
what
this
beer
is
phenomenal
d
awesome
bspa
i
will
be
buying
again
lightly
bittered
with
a
dry
feel
and
high
carbonation
more
reminiscent
of
a
saison
than
a
typical
golden
ale
faint
peppery
flavor
and
initial
sweetness
to
a
malty
balanced
finish
with
little
alcohol
heat
evident
medium
light
body
and
dryness
make
this
easy
to
drink
for
a
bigger
beer
poured
a
hazy
amberorange
that
had
floating
particles
of
yeast
with
an
average
sized
white
creamy
head
that
almost
lasted
throughout
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
of
a
staw
like
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
sweet
doughy
yeast
with
notes
of
orange
pineapple
and
corriander
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
it
tasted
very
lightly
sweet
at
first
and
then
had
a
light
bitter
fruity
flavor
with
a
hints
of
spices
and
alcohol
at
the
finish
with
the
flavor
lasting
an
average
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
very
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
and
tasty
belguim
ale
that
is
quite
drinkable
so
good
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
dr
its
got
a
pretty
steep
price
but
its
a
good
beer
for
fans
of
the
style
to
try
its
too
light
for
a
stout
lover
like
me
but
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
worth
a
go
for
any
beer
fanatic
drinkability
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
belgian
brew
would
love
to
have
again
d
i
enjoyed
this
brew
although
there
a
lot
of
very
good
bspas
out
there
a
little
less
heat
and
this
one
would
have
been
right
there
with
them
poured
straight
from
the
bottle
into
my
unibroue
tulip
again
and
again
and
again
until
said
bottle
was
empty
a
good
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
small
layer
of
foam
which
disappears
leaving
a
thin
lacing
along
the
top
great
taste
good
mouthfeel
its
belgian
havent
found
a
bad
one
yet
overall
no
gripes
with
this
ale
but
given
all
the
choices
of
belgian
strongs
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
i
ordered
a
pint
of
this
while
ordering
at
stuff
yer
face
eatery
in
brunswick
nj
near
rutgers
campus
and
finished
it
by
the
time
the
main
course
arrived
nice
golden
ale
looks
awesome
in
the
glass
very
smooth
with
a
light
fruit
after
taste
id
definitely
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
a
wonderful
beer
to
enjoy
for
the
evening
while
watching
a
movie
overall
very
refreshing
despite
the
8
alc
volume
in
my
opinion
not
top
of
the
notch
of
belgian
beers
but
quite
enjoyable
worth
a
try
d
medium
plus
d
drinkable
although
i
think
the
bitter
skunk
to
the
hops
warns
the
drinker
not
to
chug
freely
did
pair
nicely
with
my
dinner
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
gush
over
drink
very
alcoholic
but
not
particularly
heavy
so
i
cant
quite
make
the
call
dusty
golden
colors
with
nice
thick
pure
white
topper
smells
citrusy
and
sweet
with
malty
nose
appeal
a
great
take
on
belgium
ale
apples
pears
lemons
apricot
and
orange
flavors
nustle
their
way
thru
a
carbonated
full
bodied
swig
very
smooth
and
memorable
enjoyable
and
timeless
beer
d
oh
yes
so
so
drinkable
will
be
drinking
this
alot
for
a
long
long
time
a
prototypical
belgian
pale
ale
grainy
moderately
sweet
and
the
rest
of
the
standard
spice
and
booze
elements
very
well
integrated
into
the
whole
careful
you
dont
trip
over
that
oblivious
little
elf
while
polishing
off
this
sneaky
offering
pours
a
hazy
copper
yellow
color
with
a
medium
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
and
slight
herbal
spruce
hint
taste
is
tropical
citrus
like
pineapple
and
banana
on
the
front
end
with
a
definite
herbal
hop
flavor
following
into
the
middle
finishing
is
grassy
and
herbal
hops
the
beer
is
a
little
oily
on
the
palate
but
has
a
nice
medium
body
d
very
flavorful
er
which
goes
down
fairly
smooth
would
definitely
purchase
again
although
i
wish
it
could
be
purchase
in
a
smaller
bottle
from
the
lcbo
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
bodied
nice
spicy
finish
all
around
a
very
delicious
beer
and
good
flavors
that
blend
together
seamlessly
so
far
my
favorite
beer
from
brewery
achouffe
highly
carbonated
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
no
hint
of
the
8
at
all
taste
lingers
on
your
palate
for
quite
a
while
very
easy
drinking
dare
i
say
refreshing
beer
its
january
in
maine
but
i
could
easily
put
down
a
couple
of
these
in
the
summer
dry
crisp
finish
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
an
interesting
brew
well
worth
a
try
combines
two
of
my
favorite
styles
successfully
pours
a
very
hazy
light
orange
with
a
big
bold
head
head
is
thick
like
texas
toast
plenty
of
carbonation
smells
surprisingly
peppery
yet
pleasant
bit
like
spiced
fruit
some
malts
pears
and
hoppy
citrus
flavours
are
very
light
and
sweet
bananas
pears
bit
of
orange
bit
of
citrus
and
bold
pepper
with
all
the
pepper
one
would
think
this
beer
unpleasant
but
it
surprisingly
works
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
reminding
me
a
bit
of
champagne
so
much
so
that
for
new
years
i
served
this
and
people
thought
it
was
a
style
of
champagne
they
were
however
a
tad
drunk
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
savour
all
the
flavours
and
aromas
drink
it
cool
and
let
it
warm
so
that
the
subtle
complexities
shine
through
d
good
itd
easily
pick
one
of
these
up
when
im
in
that
rare
mood
for
a
belgian
one
of
the
better
belgians
that
ive
had
easily
also
gotta
love
the
adorable
chouffe
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
good
white
head
very
bubbly
the
nose
is
banana
pear
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
really
soft
and
mellow
with
a
bit
of
a
light
buttery
chardonnayesque
character
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
overripe
pear
and
spicing
really
standing
out
the
feel
is
nicemedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
good
creamy
feel
to
it
this
drinks
quite
well
and
works
nicely
with
turkey
and
accompaniments
pours
a
golden
orange
with
thick
white
head
really
nice
head
retention
as
it
dissipates
to
leaving
a
finger
or
2
still
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
more
of
hops
than
i
was
expecting
with
banana
and
belgian
yeast
quite
a
dry
sweet
flavour
with
some
mild
bitterness
really
delicious
medium
bodied
carbonation
an
extremely
nice
belgian
ale
excellent
offering
from
la
dachouffe
pours
a
cloudy
orangeygold
color
with
a
minimum
of
head
smells
yeasty
spicy
and
a
little
fruity
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
yeasty
with
some
banana
but
is
surprisingly
light
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
light
very
nice
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
belgian
ale
this
is
something
id
like
to
have
again
preferably
in
greater
quantities
very
nice
my
friend
and
i
go
to
a
place
called
growlers
pub
and
have
2
of
these
and
it
produces
a
truly
mellow
buzz
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
its
distinctiveness
and
overall
drinkability
overall
there
is
the
little
problem
that
the
style
which
it
is
made
to
be
a
stong
belgian
pale
ale
is
clearly
not
the
only
style
the
brewer
had
in
mind
in
some
ways
it
reflects
more
similarities
to
a
tripel
which
presuming
it
is
not
seems
strange
and
inclines
me
to
choose
something
like
duvel
or
la
fin
du
monde
over
la
chouffe
because
they
know
which
style
they
are
and
are
a
similar
price
d
a
beer
to
savour
and
trumps
the
duvel
for
me
o
this
one
differs
from
the
standard
superdry
belgian
strong
think
duvel
in
that
it
is
sweeter
and
fruitier
i
wouldnt
say
one
is
better
than
the
other
both
have
their
charms
if
you
want
a
sweeter
and
fruitier
beer
this
is
for
you
sometimes
might
seem
cloying
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
pale
golden
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
that
looked
like
whipped
cream
and
stuck
to
the
glass
instantly
smells
of
spicy
yeast
hints
of
citrus
fruit
with
a
medicinal
candy
sweetness
taste
is
bready
with
a
candy
apple
sweetness
that
finishes
long
there
is
also
a
slight
alcohol
presence
here
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
great
carbonation
that
was
very
enjoyable
drinks
really
really
well
after
one
750
i
wanted
another
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
slightly
dry
drinkability
scores
well
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
brew
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
recedes
relatively
quickly
by
belgian
standards
leaving
sporadic
lacing
nose
is
very
clean
grain
apple
cider
hint
of
some
sort
of
spice
white
grape
and
bubblegum
taste
is
surprisingly
big
on
bready
malt
along
with
a
good
dose
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
not
as
fruitycitrusy
as
expected
there
is
an
ironlike
metallic
tinge
that
lingers
throughout
finish
is
slightly
sweet
but
still
pretty
crisp
mediumbodied
effervescent
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
lingering
somewhat
metallic
taste
distracted
me
and
will
probably
prevent
me
from
picking
up
anymore
of
this
especially
since
other
solid
representations
of
the
same
style
i
e
duvel
are
much
cheaper
in
the
province
taste
is
lightly
winey
dough
fruit
an
interesting
fruitywoodyherbal
character
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
plus
hint
of
banana
cream
pie
and
cream
it
has
some
light
complexity
its
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
light
bitterness
that
is
more
prominent
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
but
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
slightly
stronger
light
sweetness
its
very
good
and
has
a
feel
that
is
lightly
creamy
but
also
has
some
slight
liveliness
i
found
this
very
similar
to
duvel
both
are
great
beers
and
very
tasty
ive
ordered
it
on
two
different
occasions
so
its
got
to
be
good
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
which
fades
quicker
than
you
would
expect
but
does
leave
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
berries
and
spice
with
a
rather
strong
metallic
smell
soft
fruits
like
pear
and
apple
dominate
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
spicier
finish
a
slight
hop
presence
shows
itself
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
deh
the
taste
it
dwindles
not
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
ive
had
the
abv
hits
somewhat
but
its
not
that
bad
pours
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
large
amount
of
head
in
the
duvel
tulip
tastes
quite
sweet
with
a
dark
fruit
taste
lingering
in
there
as
well
drinks
down
pretty
smooth
for
the
8
abv
but
the
sweetness
factor
to
this
makes
it
hard
to
finish
off
an
entire
750ml
bottle
decent
belgian
pale
ale
though
very
nice
beer
over
all
quite
drinkable
but
i
had
big
exceptions
and
it
didnt
quite
get
there
its
beauty
lies
in
its
subtlety
it
takes
time
to
pick
out
each
note
and
figure
out
whats
going
on
what
flavours
bounce
off
and
compliment
eachother
and
how
well
rounded
it
is
in
the
end
its
750ml
size
allows
and
invites
you
to
take
your
time
and
appreciate
all
of
this
a
fantastic
seasonal
release
from
this
already
great
seasonal
lcbo
lineup
worth
its
price
and
worth
the
time
to
appreciate
this
golden
belgian
ale
a
tasty
belgian
strong
ale
a
great
sipper
for
a
quiet
night
in
a
sweeter
gnomeier
version
of
fin
du
monde
or
more
accurately
fin
du
monde
is
a
drier
lessgnomed
version
of
la
chouffe
worth
a
pickup
despite
the
slightly
high
price
point
at
least
in
ontario
not
particularly
impressive
but
easy
enough
to
put
a
glass
away
hints
of
coriander
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
kick
to
it
limited
head
and
carbonation
outstanding
flavour
a
much
better
choice
than
a
runofthemill
beer
like
leffe
blonde
which
i
wont
buy
this
ones
a
keeper
d
really
good
for
an
8
sleeper
nothing
overpowering
to
turn
this
in
to
a
oneanddone
for
the
evening
cheers

solid

strong
pale
ale
and
another
excellent
offering
from
brasserie
dachouffe
a
sophisticated
offering
and
amongst
the
finer
belgian
ales
this
one
gets
my
seal
of
approval
and
is
something
that
ill
gladly
welcome
in
my
cellar
anytime
d
good
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
d
funny
thing
is
the
style
is
called
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
true
for
abv
only
its
extremely
drinkable
and
actually
pretty
light
tasting
a
very
good
beer
with
great
balance
and
good
detail
but
didnt
have
too
much
kick
to
really
blow
me
away
memorable
as
a
great
beer
but
a
light
one
at
the
same
time
d
nicely
hidden
alcohol
very
drinkable
wish
id
found
this
one
sooner
d
a
combination
of
a
light
body
and
fairly
well
masked
alcohol
make
this
beer
go
down
quicker
than
the
strength
would
recommend
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
cool
october
evening
d
very
tasty
strong
belgian
although
the
higher
abv
does
come
through
it
is
not
offensive
the
flavours
are
nicely
rounded
and
it
goes
down
smooth
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
and
would
definitely
try
it
again
d
high
considering
the
abv
nothing
offensive
is
present
and
the
flavors
are
pleasant
this
was
great
i
loved
the
spice
and
the
overall
flavor
i
really
wanna
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
considerable
floating
debris
smell
is
of
spices
and
fruits
taste
is
good
fruits
and
spices
are
present
lots
of
flavor
here
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
d
i
believe
this
one
is
drinkable
lads
yes
i
do
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
heavily
carbonated
and
bone
dry
on
the
finish
definately
a
champaigne
of
beers
someone
should
send
miller
a
bottle
or
two
not
a
perfect
belgian
golden
ale
but
definitely
a
very
good
beer
d
not
so
much
a
complex
beer
as
a
sharply
contrasting
beer
drinkable
but
not
as
memorable
as
id
like
d
a
very
good
drinking
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
favorite
in
antwerp
which
says
something
since
it
rises
above
many
of
the
great
beers
available
the
gnome
on
the
bottle
doesnt
lie
you
will
be
admiring
this
beer
once
you
get
it
into
the
glass
and
enjoy
it
once
you
take
your
first
sips
when
the
glass
was
empty
the
lace
trailings
were
wonderful
thank
goodness
for
the
inspirational
gnomes
of
the
ardennes
d
a
very
solid
belgian
lots
of
spice
in
the
smell
and
a
nice
fruity
belgian
yeast
mox
in
the
taste
fews
smaller
than
8
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
paired
with
fish
meat
and
italian
cheese
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
for
the
high
abv
d
i
really
liked
this
one
new
meets
old
demonstrative
of
the
style
as
a
whole
while
packing
the
flavors
and
spicy
notes
that
you
would
expect
of
a
modern
craft
brewery
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
like
liquid
breadone
bottle
was
more
than
enough
for
one
sitting
alright
a
quick
review
here
cloudy
pale
gold
with
some
sediment
nice
head
light
carbonation
citrusy
with
some
metallic
notes
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
good
still
a
little
metallic
tasting
nice
spice
however
8
abv
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
to
an
extent
maybe
a
bad
bottle
kind
of
a
typical
blond
and
maybe
not
even
that
good
disappointing
roasted
pork
loin
with
dried
fruit
and
spices
overall
a
very
solid
strong
pale
ale
the
flavors
and
aromas
could
have
been
a
little
bolder
and
the
palate
a
little
creamier
but
this
was
a
very
solid
effort
for
sure
and
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
la
chouffe
is
a
super
lively
slightly
hazy
golden
with
lots
of
floaters
it
has
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
warm
aroma
of
spice
fruit
bread
and
phenol
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
very
smooth
the
finish
is
clean
dry
and
delicate
wow
it
tastes
fruity
i
detect
apple
pear
peach
cherry
and
maybe
some
dried
fruit
the
finish
is
earthy
leathery
peppery
and
phenolic
this
beer
is
a
treat
this
would
be
just
as
appropriate
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
into
a
tulip
glass
poured
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smelled
of
coriander
orange
peel
bubble
gum
sugar
and
apricot
the
taste
revealed
all
of
the
above
with
an
excellent
sense
of
balance
dissolving
to
an
apricotpeel
finish
mediumbodied
and
more
carbonated
than
expected
made
for
a
nice
sensation
great
beer
overallnotes
i
love
my
belgian
beers
and
this
is
another
wellexecuted
one
perhaps
not
on
the
same
level
as
duvel
but
jeez
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
drinking
this
was
a
good
enjoyable
experience
yummy
this
beer
is
a
feast
fir
the
eyes
and
nose
as
well
as
the
mouth
i
think
i
had
their
christmas
beer
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
as
well
drinkability
is
ok
to
god
as
this
brew
has
all
of
the
makings
of
a
really
great
beer
but
comes
up
litte
short
in
flavor
d
a
relatively
robust
8
abv
will
almost
certainly
hurt
drinkability
of
any
beer
but
the
yeasty
finish
more
commonly
found
in
saisons
and
farmhouse
ales
also
hurts
the
drinkabilty
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
also
not
as
great
as
most
folks
think
not
bad
but
there
are
superior
bsas
out
there
in
comparison
to
this
one
delirium
tremens
duvel
don
de
dieu
to
name
a
few
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
lots
of
flavour
and
i
certainly
dont
notice
the
8
alcohol
overall
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
overrated
its
average
to
me
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
especially
for
10
for
the
25oz
bottle
d
well
balanced
and
smooth
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
of
known
the
coriander
was
added
if
it
wasnt
on
the
bottle
but
the
spice
notes
were
there
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
something
i
would
pick
up
often
d
smooth
light
flavors
nothing
harsh
easy
drinking
pours
a
hazy
golden
well
carbonated
ale
color
with
a
billowing
pure
white
head
that
does
settle
to
a
very
white
nice
ring
the
smell
is
floral
and
spicy
with
corianderlemon
pepper
and
some
musty
peat
smells
throw
in
some
apples
and
pears
its
a
bouquet
of
fruit
the
taste
is
the
same
and
more
it
has
the
yeast
taste
followed
by
bananas
and
apples
with
pepper
and
citrus
really
well
balanced
and
a
delight
to
drink
on
a
warm
spring
day
the
mouth
feel
is
perfect
medium
well
carbonated
and
just
right
on
the
taste
buds
this
is
a
real
drinkable
cheers
to
the
chouffes
gnomes
a
beautiful
bspa
d
decent
belgian
beer
but
it
didnt
stand
out
to
me
as
anything
being
very
distinctive
or
outstanding
somewhat
light
and
refreshing
despite
the
8
abv
will
be
paying
a
visit
to
this
brewery
later
this
year
can
i
review
this
same
beer
on
tap
as
well
drinkability
i
think
the
key
is
balanance
here
harmony
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
d
drank
a
decent
amount
of
it
but
couldnt
finish
the
entire
bottle
unusual
for
me
when
i
drink
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
but
with
more
hoppy
bitterness
light
medium
body
somewhat
refreshing
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
prevalent
and
doesnt
support
the
flavor
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
definitely
a
crisp
beer
for
the
abv
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
easy
on
the
palate
while
packing
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
great
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
d
this
beer
is
a
good
sipper
yet
is
also
refreshing
at
the
same
time
thanks
to
jian
for
sharing
this
bottle
im
starting
to
learn
that
i
think
i
like
the
zestyness
of
the
american
interpretation
of
belgian
beers
rather
than
the
originals
overall
really
went
well
with
the
meal
some
of
my
guests
are
more
fans
of
wine
than
beer
but
also
enjoyed
the
beverage
very
unfortunate
that
these
bottles
are
hard
to
come
by
where
i
am
second
with
david
the
gnome
i
drink
but
this
time
is
blonde
served
in
a
tulip
glass
duvel
looks
orange

taste
biscuity

and

glass
pretty
much
like
the
smell
mouthfeel
dry
extra
bitter
with
a
bittersweet
finish
robust
and
thick
body
hardly
feels
its
8
degrees
of
alcohol
drinkability
very
good
beer
with
coriander
and
sugar
i
enjoyed
a
lot
with
fillet
fish
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
reasonable
carbonation
with
a
good
mouthfeel
served
this
in
a
tulip
glass
drinkability
could
do
probably
two
of
this
size
as
it
does
go
down
easy
but
8
abv
needs
some
caution
but
rather
masked
making
it
seem
a
lot
less
notes
solid
offering
and
good
example
of
the
style
lots
of
flavors
that
go
well
together
up
towards
the
top
for
the
style
not
as
good
as
duvel
but
duvel
sets
quite
a
high
bar
to
exceed
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
o
with
out
a
doubt
one
of
my
favourite
belgium
ales
with
all
its
qualities
shining
through
a
wondeful
well
balanced
complex
beer
that
is
a
must
to
try
decent
carbonation
and
medium
body
make
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
i
cannot
believe
i
found
this
on
tap
fantastic
beer
a
great
smooth
finish
that
leaves
your
palate
dry
and
crisp
and
wanting
more
an
excellent
belgian
beer
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
the
combination
of
the
delicate
light
flavour
with
the
smoothness
and
dry
finish
work
well
i
find
duvel
and
delirium
tremens
more
interesting
but
i
definitely
find
this
more
drinkable
a
cold
bottle
of
la
chouffe
on
a
sunny
summer
day
would
probably
be
just
about
the
best
thing
ever
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
most
refreshing
belgian
blonds
ive
ever
had
body
is
medium
to
thin
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
prop
up
an
otherwise
thin
body
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
the
beer
finishes
nicely
there
is
minimal
bitterness
and
a
really
nice
fruity
palate
in
the
midpalate
drinkability
is
high
and
so
is
mouthfeel
a
really
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
dead
in
the
mouth
medium
to
light
bodied
quite
possibly
my
favorite
beer
period
d
one
bottle
big
bottle
is
enough
but
it
went
down
with
ease
this
beer
is
balanced
perfectly
absolutely
delicious
very
good
overall
balanced
with
some
different
hopping
for
this
style
easy
to
drink
which
in
this
case
also
means
not
too
challenging
d
nice
but
would
tire
easily
one
of
my
favorite
easy
drinking
belgian
ales
overall
great
beer
very
well
done
and
would
love
to
taste
again
notes
hmmm
not
being
a
big
fan
of
the
style
i
fear
i
really
do
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
it
may
deserve
what
seems
a
good
brew
if
a
bit
trite
for
the
the
style
it
is
well
crafted
matches
well
common
expectations
for
a
golden
ale
but
there
is
little
else
that
entices
me
to
repeat
when
having
other
choices
around
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
super
creamy
eggwhite
head
lots
of
clove
and
spice
on
the
nose
and
palate
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
a
little
pepper
has
an
lemony
peach
taste
with
a
light
hoppiness
at
the
finish
lots
of
carbonation
that
works
so
well
with
the
complex
flavour
it
simply
bursts
in
the
mouth
the
reasonable
abv
means
this
shouldnt
be
a
session
beer
but
i
can
drink
la
chouffe
all
night
a
very
appealing
belgian
ale
plenty
of
complexity
but
with
an
overall
soft
impression
this
is
the
gnome
to
purchase
and
sample
not
that
i
could
tell
them
apart
good
ale
extra
12
mark
awarded
for
taste
in
reflection
reviewed
from
my
notes
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
le
chouffe
goblet
its
a
golden
orange
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
its
translucent
and
has
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
visible
within
it
has
a
very
nice
earthy
yeast
aroma
there
may
be
a
hint
of
fruit
in
it
as
well
it
has
a
great
grassy
wheat
like
taste
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
its
spiced
to
perfection
it
has
a
heavier
body
than
i
expected
and
a
plenty
of
carbonation
its
a
bit
strong
but
very
good
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
pours
as
a
slightly
hazy
burnt
yellow
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
massive
amount
of
carbonation
huge
malty
aroma
with
classic
belgian
yeast
fresh
bread
and
a
slightly
medicinal
edge
the
first
flavours
that
hit
you
are
malty
with
lots
of
grainy
cereal
this
is
followed
by
a
nice
warming
alcohol
feel
which
lasts
throughout
there
is
a
definite
taste
of
spice
hints
of
pepper
and
a
gentle
sweet
sugar
it
is
definitely
on
the
heavy
side
and
the
carbonation
is
huge
in
the
mouth
really
like
the
flavours
in
this
they
help
to
make
this
very
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
value
not
sure
as
this
was
a
gift
what
a
great
one
d
8
really
never
would
think
that
goes
down
well
and
is
very
refreshing
very
well
balanced
and
is
usually
a
couple
of
dollars
cheaper
than
duvel
is
here
in
sydney
that
is
big
here
when
good
beer
is
expensive
one
750
is
more
than
suitable
not
as
good
as
duvel
is
but
a
good
second
and
a
good
alternative
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
cant
grab
onto
anything
special
about
the
gnome
cheers
d
good
example
of
the
style
could
drink
this
all
day
enjoyable
and
refreshing
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
it
seems
like
it
tastes
best
in
its
namesake
glass
of
course
its
probably
entirely
psychological
peachcolored
golden
malty
and
fruity
nose
with
citrus
dominance
returning
bitter
in
taste
this
is
indeed
spicy
coriander
is
the
only
spice
used
and
saaz
hops
fairly
present
in
fact
a
very
dry
beer
as
and
when
the
tasting
citrus
flavors
quickly
become
tough
and
dry
in
my
opinion
it
lacks
a
little
character
and
body
to
beer
to
win
d
a
solid
beer
that
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
a
nice
crisp
beer
pure
gold
with
a
brilliant
ray
of
orange
shining
through
where
the
light
hits
a
fluffy
twofingers
of
white
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
small
groups
of
foam
behind
aroma
is
big
with
coriander
a
bit
of
fruit
and
citrus
malts
and
a
slightly
funky
yeast
which
all
rise
together
giving
the
nose
a
real
treat
fruity
spicy
and
malty
on
the
palate
with
a
subtle
but
near
perfect
hop
bite
at
the
end
more
yeast
some
sweetness
perhaps
butterscotch
and
a
squirt
of
lemon
finish
it
all
up
goes
down
smooth
and
almost
creamy
at
first
but
ends
dry
with
a
perfect
amount
of
alcohol
heat
meandering
down
the
back
of
the
throat
one
of
the
finest
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
and
thats
saying
quite
a
bit
da
good
beer
but
the
spices
need
to
be
put
on
a
leash
drinkability
for
me
extremely
drinkable
if
i
had
another
bottle
im
sure
id
drink
it
too
despite
the
high
abv
d
very
smooth
for
8
abv
nice
and
complex
as
it
warms
d
very
high
abv
isnt
felt
as
much
but
could
be
sneaky
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
tasting
and
crafted
beer
about
my
only
thing
is
that
i
wish
that
the
floaters
stayed
put
that
always
turns
me
off
but
otherwise
and
excellent
beer
and
i
am
not
one
that
is
big
on
spicy
beers
my
allergies
are
a
little
messed
up
right
now
so
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
the
beer
again
with
a
fresher
palate
ive
now
tried
all
the
beers
available
from
this
brewer
where
i
live
in
calgary
3
in
total
i
wish
there
was
more
because
they
seem
to
brew
some
good
stuff
d
there
are
high
alcohol
beers
that
you
sip
and
drink
slowly
and
then
there
are
ones
that
someone
still
come
across
as
refreshing
this
one
is
refreshing
even
at
8
abv
the
spicy
dry
finish
makes
this
a
refreshing
and
great
beer
to
enjoy
edit
had
a
34
year
old
vintage
recently
it
was
still
great
but
beginning
to
decline
i
would
recommend
this
one
fresh
d
quite
easy
to
drink
though
its
well
above
a
sessionable
abv
at
8
fluffly
pils
malt
up
front
with
a
big
wet
fruity
finish
accented
by
light
coriander
citrus
light
and
springy
hides
8
abv
very
well
i
expect
that
i
will
top
up
the
xmas
fridge
with
a
couple
of
these
d
very
easy
to
drink
dont
even
notice
the
8
abv
good
taste
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
try
nostalgia
aside
this
is
still
a
pleasant
example
of
the
style
though
i
expect
their
ipa
plays
even
more
to
the
strength
of
the
brewery
elves
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
it
does
anything
for
me
to
separate
itself
from
the
pack
but
its
still
a
wellputtogether
brew
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
like
duvel
which
i
do
than
this
is
for
you
something
that
is
worth
a
try
pours
a
clowdy
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
lace
of
white
head
doesnt
display
much
retension
aroma
slightly
sulfuric
and
yeasty
medium
to
high
amount
of
carb
and
a
medium
feel
taste
is
slightly
tart
with
a
bit
of
yeast
crisp
finish
has
little
to
no
malt
sweetness
or
hop
bitterness
feel
and
carb
is
reminding
me
of
champagne
as
it
warms
clove
appears
in
both
taste
and
nose
and
a
bit
more
sweetness
its
hard
to
fault
la
chouffe
though
it
is
pretty
boilerplate
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
sometimes
though
you
just
need
a
beer
that
adheres
to
the
style
guidelines
and
delivers
on
what
its
should
do
id
happily
revisit
this
gem
again
not
an
overthetop
belgian
pale
by
any
means
more
delicate
and
refined
light
fruity
esters
of
pear
and
apple
dance
with
a
light
lemon
hints
of
light
summer
grains
and
hay
sparkly
carbonation
with
a
light
dry
and
refreshing
finish
drinkable
and
refreshing
in
boatloads
cheers
rob
i
tried
this
at
cafe
belgique
in
amsterdam
it
was
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
or
unique
about
it
i
have
trouble
even
thinking
of
what
to
compare
it
to
because
it
wasnt
too
memorable
i
think
this
could
go
well
with
or
without
a
meal
if
you
have
a
chance
and
like
pale
ales
try
it
otherwise
id
recommend
their
dark
ale
mcchouffe
which
was
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
present
which
results
in
good
drinkability
so
long
as
one
does
not
mind
being
drunk
quickly
mfd
some
thing
doesnt
feel
right
maybe
the
brew
is
too
slick
or
there
is
a
weird
proportion
of
carbonation
to
body
thickness
i
dont
know
i
think
it
lacks
a
crisp
carbonation
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
they
are
just
dull
drinkability
easily
likable
and
easily
drinkable
at
least
in
the
11
2
ounce
format
its
a
tasty
wellfortified
belgian
blonde
d
goes
down
easily
very
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
i
had
the
whole
750ml
bottle
to
myself
and
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
highly
recommended
the
only
bad
thing
i
could
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
lost
its
good
taste
during
and
after
my
meal
i
drank
it
with
beef
and
it
totally
spoiled
the
great
taste
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
just
not
with
a
meal
m
smooth
as
silk
goes
down
like
a
glass
of
apple
cider
they
got
this
one
right
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
on
my
next
trip
to
my
favorite
beer
store
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
it
smelled
like
wild
spicy
yeast
with
earthy
caramel
and
some
banana
and
nutty
malt
it
tasted
like
light
wild
yeast
and
sweet
honey
and
belgian
sugar
with
a
bit
of
waxy
hops
and
light
caramel
it
was
watery
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
with
a
super
clean
taste
although
not
a
ton
of
depth
or
complexity
it
had
decent
body
but
the
carbonation
never
died
down
like
it
usually
does
with
bottle
conditioned
ales
it
was
very
delicate
but
still
hid
the
alcohol
pretty
well
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
but
i
ended
up
somewhat
bored
half
way
through
the
bottle
superearthy
with
lots
of
depth
la
chouffe
has
always
delivered
the
goods
and
this
bottleyear
is
no
different
yum
yum
yum
yum
yum
yum
yum
yum
drinkability
love
this
beer
would
rate
it
as
one
of
my
favorite
bspas
and
ive
had
it
on
several
occasions
always
a
pleasure
overall
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
thought
it
was
much
better
but
this
time
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
cheers
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
another
on
the
same
night
the
flavor
profiles
in
this
are
not
complex
but
each
component
makes
it
enjoyable
drinkability
la
chouffe
is
definitely
a
tasty
bspa
a
complex
aroma
and
above
average
flavor
and
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
drank
it
before
drinkability
is
pretty
good
even
with
the
8
abv
personally
if
duvel
or
don
de
dieu
is
available
in
your
area
id
go
with
one
of
those
instead
of
this
beer
cheers
altogether
a
good
bspa
and
full
of
character
the
bottle
features
a
cartoon
of
a
gnome
and
has
some
background
on
the
brewery
it
was
poured
into
a
affligem
goblet
its
appearance
is
a
golden
tone
with
a
small
white
head
which
will
quickly
fade
to
a
ring
the
smell
of
la
chouffe
comprises
citrus
pepper
and
sugar
the
taste
has
some
more
of
the
light
citrus
fruit
spice
and
some
light
hops
come
into
play
its
mouthfeel
is
delightful
with
a
nice
balance
of
honey
pepper
yeast
some
other
flavors
drinkability
is
very
much
there
especially
considering
the
8
abv
it
had
been
perhaps
a
year
or
so
since
i
last
drank
la
chouffe
and
boy
was
i
depriving
myself
this
is
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
d
quite
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
very
good
belgian
ale
pricy
but
worth
it
every
once
in
a
while
drinkability
overall
a
decent
belgan
and
i
would
try
again
pale
orangeamber
huge
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
are
gone
very
quickly
smells
of
orange
peel
corriander
hints
of
clove
candi
sugar
dusty
roads
on
a
hot
day
tastes
well
not
like
that
interesting
big
malt
backbone
you
get
the
sweet
and
rich
hit
as
you
swallow
it
corriander
yeah
i
see
it
hints
of
star
anise
reminds
me
that
i
left
a
tool
on
at
work
when
i
left
today
bummer
i
hope
its
ok
in
the
am
anyway
interesting
theres
some
overextraction
astringency
going
on
in
here
typical
for
the
style
a
little
fizzy
tingle
to
the
mouth
again
pretty
typical
for
the
style
not
bad
if
you
cant
get
a
duvel
and
are
dying
for
a
draft
beer
this
is
the
best
of
the
strong
belgian
pales
thats
not
a
duvel
worth
getting
at
any
bar
and
and
easy
drinker
even
with
the
elevated
alcohol
by
volume
would
recommend
most
anytime
you
see
on
tap
overall
phenomenal
ale
this
is
probably
the
best
belgian
ale
ive
had
to
date
great
beer
i
think
its
sexy
i
want
its
body
and
im
letting
you
know
i
hope
this
beer
dates
and
impregnates
many
models
well
into
its
golden
years
the
weekly
beer
run
to
swam
shiromas
wine
and
morereviled
this
fine
beer
the
head
is
tall
airy
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
hold
it
up
to
light
is
the
particles
of
yeast
swirling
around
this
should
help
to
keep
those
sip
stealers
away
the
color
is
orangeish
with
an
unfiltered
look
smell
great
spice
fruit
the
taste
is
great
fresh
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
if
not
for
the
price
you
could
sit
and
sip
this
all
the
way
through
the
bbq
if
i
wanted
to
pick
a
beer
to
build
a
menu
around
this
would
be
a
good
choice
it
will
compliment
spicy
complex
flavors
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
that
i
should
revisit
this
brewery
more
often
as
ive
never
been
disappointed
well
worth
a
shot
d
very
drinkable
great
overall
taste
balanced
with
little
hints
of
booze
a
coworker
of
mine
recommended
this
to
me
and
his
enthusiasm
is
wellfounded
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
the
flavors
did
not
impress
me
much
at
first
but
grew
on
me
after
a
while
i
would
like
to
try
this
sidebyside
with
troublette
to
taste
any
similarities
as
i
la
chouffe
reminded
me
a
bit
of
the
ol
snail
in
short
get
this
if
its
available
in
your
area
or
trade
for
it
definitely
worth
a
try
easy
to
put
away
a
bottle
or
two
orange
maybe
darker
gold
in
color
but
with
little
head
at
all
bubblegum
and
sugary
fruits
tease
the
nose
to
the
taste
it
is
sweet
as
expected
there
is
some
nectarine
apricot
sugar
and
bubblegum
flavor
pleasing
me
was
coriander
used
in
this
beer
because
it
has
that
spiced
coriander
flavor
as
each
sip
comes
to
a
close
light
on
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
and
balanced
without
much
perceived
alcohol
which
makes
this
beer
easily
drinkable
recommended
d
very
nice
and
refreshing
if
you
do
not
drink
this
beer
fast
enough
the
spice
turns
a
little
strong
and
is
noticeably
harder
to
drink
this
was
never
meant
to
be
a
power
drinking
beer
so
0
5
adjustment
for
taste
and
drinkability
good
drinkability
packs
quite
a
strong
alcohol
punch
surprisingly
nice
la
chouffe
is
a
wonderful
belgian
strong
pale
a
style
which
i
am
very
fond
of
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
and
one
brilliant
beer
definitely
a
favourite
and
possibly
a
legend
in
the
beer
world
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
if
i
have
to
grade
it
against
the
great
beers
in
this
category
it
doesnt
stack
up
as
well
while
chouffe
is
a
great
belgian
craft
brewer
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
by
a
stretch
creamy
mouthfeel
but
light
and
refreshing
thanks
to
an
active
but
moderate
carbonation
theres
alcohol
in
the
flavor
profile
but
its
still
hard
to
believe
its
8
its
just
goes
down
too
easy
if
there
was
a
bar
around
here
with
this
on
tap
id
surely
be
thrown
out
eventually
this
stuff
is
too
easy
to
drink
enjoyed
from
a
wine
glass
on
a
spring
night
in
edinburgh
pours
nicely
and
has
a
medium
golden
color
a
rather
strong
fruity
scent
on
the
nose
this
beer
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
it
has
sort
of
a
wheaty
taste
and
almost
reminded
me
of
a
wit
lots
of
fruit
and
very
smooth
delicious
and
eminently
drinkable
could
have
drank
that
beer
to
the
end
of
the
world
that
night
drinkability
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
each
sip
fades
and
as
it
does
so
invites
another
and
another
i
could
easily
do
2
or
3
of
these
right
now
and
i
certainly
will
return
to
this
beer
given
the
chance
d
im
generally
a
fan
of
bspas
and
im
generally
a
fan
of
achouffe
so
its
no
surprise
that
this
would
be
up
my
alley
david
the
gnome
wont
steer
you
wrong
d
great
stuff
and
it
has
held
up
well
at
just
about
three
years
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
at
this
point
and
this
could
be
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
a
bit
high
in
abv
but
so
what
i
would
drink
a
ton
of
this
year
round
but
preferably
in
warmer
weather
mouthfeel
carbonated
to
the
max
with
a
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
improved
as
it
warmed
up
if
it
was
only
a
little
lower
on
the
price
and
abv
scale
i
would
give
it
a
5
for
drinkability
this
is
among
my
favorite
strong
belgian
pales
that
ive
had
world
class
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
present
which
results
in
good
drinkability
so
long
as
one
does
not
mind
being
drunk
quickly
plush
feel
mediumfull
body
very
smooth
very
creamy
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
dry
finish
not
overly
complex
but
delicious
nonetheless
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
and
definitely
will
get
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
pours
a
nice
deep
gold
with
a
medium
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
is
earthy
and
a
little
yeasty
with
some
background
phenolic
malt
and
spice
notes
taste
is
also
earthy
and
spicy
cloves
and
some
fruit
notes
some
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
add
some
bitterness
complex
balanced
and
very
good
very
well
carbonated
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
dry
pretty
drinkable
and
quite
good
overall
drinkability
absolutely
d
oh
so
drinkable
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
on
tap
very
good
d
i
dont
mind
drinking
a
big
bottle
to
myself
because
this
beer
is
so
versatile
that
it
can
pair
with
just
about
anything
i
usually
feel
like
eating
d
extremely
drinkable
and
if
not
for
the
high
alcohol
content
which
is
hidden
very
well
i
must
add
seems
close
enough
to
an
equivalent
belgian
session
beer
one
of
my
wifes
favorites
la
chouffe
is
a
delicious
springthoughtsinducing
golden
ale
that
transcends
ones
mind
to
warm
fields
ok
enough
with
that
its
just
a
damned
good
belgian
farmale
the
wonderful
1pt
9
4oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
bright
white
fluffy
head
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
a
hearty
spiced
yeast
that
comes
trough
with
sipping
and
stays
in
the
nose
hints
of
lemon
pepper
come
through
as
well
in
this
highly
refreshing
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
flat
the
yeast
is
creamier
than
hoppier
quite
nice
extremely
drinkable
i
think
it
does
have
a
slight
alcohol
kick
to
it
but
in
the
best
tradition
of
the
belgians
its
so
well
alleviated
beautiful
to
drink
a
real
pleasure
less
lagery
than
the
nose
because
of
a
slightly
sour
cidery
character
which
dominates
quite
a
hoppy
flavour
on
the
finish
bit
simple
on
the
palate
though
theres
those
sour
slightly
hoppy
notes
and
thats
most
of
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
very
nice
and
smooth
in
fact
plus
its
quite
a
nice
inoffensive
sipping
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
my
loins
breach
and
burst
forth
with
essence
that
being
said
the
fresh
sample
i
had
off
draught
in
belgium
utterly
blew
my
mind
because
of
how
good
it
was
so
maybe
the
fresher
the
better
although
this
bottle
wasnt
quite
as
mind
shattering
it
was
certainly
very
enjoyable
if
youre
curious
to
try
belgian
ales
or
if
you
already
know
you
like
them
be
sure
to
stock
the
cart
with
plenty
of
these
little
gnomes
light
bodied
easy
drinker
belgian
ale
highly
drinkable
but
watch
out
as
this
beer
does
have
legs
notes
quite
the
hoppy
bspa
it
features
some
citrus
fruits
exotic
fruits
a
nice
touch
of
spice
and
a
sizeable
but
undetectable
alcohol
presence
this
is
pretty
good
but
wheres
that
belgian
yeast
that
i
love
so
dearly
anyhow
still
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
bspas
would
drink
this
again
and
looking
forward
to
other
brews
by
this
brewery
this
is
an
amazing
beer
there
my
review
is
over
ok
for
real
though
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
massive
fluffy
white
head
with
great
retention
and
amazing
lacing
smell
is
an
amazing
blend
of
yeast
pear
grape
apple
some
bread
and
alcohol
just
incredible
taste
is
great
as
well
ripe
sweet
fruit

description
with
some
yeast
bread
dry
malt
and
grassy
hops
touch
of
spice
as
well
but
i
couldnt
tell
you
what
exact
ones
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
with
a
certain
creaminess
too
it
sweet
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
overall
a
great
beer
and
very
easy
drinker
so
easy
i
had
to
capitalize
very
pours
bright
orange
with
a
vast
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
orangy
with
anise
clove
and
allspice
the
flavor
is
lightly
phenolic
spicy
with
clove
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
lovely
pours
a
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
huge
frothy
head
smell
is
slightly
spicy
not
sure
on
the
exact
spices
but
after
having
the
gulden
draak
this
is
entirely
different
clean
zesty
and
spicy
on
the
taste
a
little
more
bitter
in
the
taste
and
not
as
full
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
good
flavor
profile
and
nonapparent
alcohol
make
this
belgian
ale
easy
to
consume
and
quite
a
treat
d
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
general
tastes
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
can
ever
complain
about
midhigh
abv
is
unnoticed
d
this
is
a
great
belgian
ale
it
was
nice
to
have
it
on
tap
overall
not
as
good
as
chouffes
ipa
but
decent
id
probably
try
it
again
spices
arent
as
detectable
as
i
expected
them
to
be
had
a
bottle
with
steamed
mussels
in
a
bacon
sauce
delicious
pairing
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
double
wit
or
strong
wheat
for
the
vanillalike
spiced
yeast
character
theres
also
a
great
orange
candy
taste
under
the
yeast
character
that
adds
a
nice
juicy
element
and
like
so
many
great
belgians
this
beer
ends
with
a
peppery
hop
note
ill
come
back
to
this
one
d
an
excellent
beer
sweet
but
not
overly
very
enjoyable
im
not
sure
anything
can
displace
duvel
from
my
personal
list
of
top
strong
belgian
pales
but
this
is
a
unique
tasty
and
just
darn
good
brew
easy
to
drink
and
easier
to
enjoy
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
in
long
beach
served
in
a
goblet
glass
color
is
a
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
bubblegum
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavors
match
the
aroma
with
bubblegum
and
spice
notes
also
giving
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
a
little
alcohol
nice
and
light
for
the
size
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
belgian
beer
to
end
the
evening
fullbodied
with
brisk
carbonation
expected
from
the
aggressive
belgian
yeast
a
strong
beer
that
would
limit
drinkability
if
looking
to
make
a
night
out
of
it
however
very
mild
on
the
tongue
if
this
were
to
be
part
of
a
tasting
or
if
one
had
plans
of
switching
beers
for
the
evening
at
some
point
huge
head
white
good
lacing
smallish
bubbles
somewhat
diminishing

fizzy
pretty
opaque
very
flowery

alcoholy
like
allagash
intense

aroma
coriander
bananas
fizzy
taste
clean
sweet
aftertaste
lightish
taste
compared
with
the
aroma
bananas
flowers
spices
slight
bite
of
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
but
really
creamy
smooth
finish
not
much
alcohol
taste
which
is
good
compared
with
the
aroma
tasty
but
missing
something
in
the
taste
more
fruit
too
much
flower
light
slightly
watery
taste
overall
lots
of
complexity
for
this
one
and
well
deserving
of
its
reputation
a
simply
beautiful
product
so
complex
and
so
elegant
really
a
lot
going
on
here
but
in
such
harmony
this
is
beer
at
its
finest
overall
pretty
solid
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
houblin
lachouffe
a
lot
more
than
this
one
i
will
try
this
again
the
bottle
is
cool
as
hell
i
had
this
on
tap
at
high
street
grill
it
was
presented
in
an
oversized
la
chouffe
goblet
it
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
minimal
head
it
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
mildly
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
but
nothing
exciting
the
flavor
profile
was
sweet
aand
floral
the
finish
was
crisp
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
was
way
too
quaffable
an
enjoyable
brew
notes
i
find
this
to
be
an
odd
duck
of
a
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
and
i
plan
on
buying
more
but
at
the
same
time
in
most
categories
compared
to
others
in
the
same
style
it
is
weak
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
beer
that
breaks
free
of
the
stereotypical
belgian
strong
pale
mold
without
straying
too
far
great
brew
overall
an
excellent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
took
me
a
few
sips
before
i
could
really
get
immersed
in
the
complexity
that
is
la
chouffe
will
have
whenever
possible
drinkability
is
ok
ive
never
been
to
impressed
with
this
beer
a
bit
to
sharp
with
not
enough
depth
of
flavor
pours
a
hazy
sunburst
yelloworange
fluffy
white
head
that
gives
way
to
mostly
lacing
after
a
short
while
aroma
is
mellow
hops
with
strong
notes
of
candied
oranges
flavor
is
sweetly
hoppy
with
lots
of
citrus
in
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
jacking
up
the
volume
of
hops
that
arent
really
hoppy
any
brewery
can
pump
tons
of
chops
into
an
ipa
and
blow
your
head
off
with
the
flavors
this
beer
is
full
of
more
mellow
hops
that
dont
blow
your
head
off
interesting
mix
of
sweet
malt
along
with
the
hop
character
i
described
above
good
stuff
mcchouffe
was
a
little
disappointing
to
me
so
this
exceeded
all
expectations
aside
from
the
kind
of
bland
smell
everything
else
about
this
brew
is
great
great
tasting
malts
and
the
appearance
is
just
enticing
a
truly
solid
belgian
pale
ale
d
i
had
10oz
with
no
problems
but
a
second
might
have
gotten
bothersome
due
to
the
fizz
d
very
drinkable
a
liked
it
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
its
easy
to
drink
a
bottle
before
you
know
what
hit
you
id
try
this
again
in
the
future
overall
a
tasty
bspa
i
really
enjoyed
the
strong
citrus
qualities
and
mild
spices
a
winner
very
solid
belgian
strong
pale
will
be
looking
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
this
in
the
future
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
spicy
aroma
with
lots
of
crisp
fruit
notes
flavor
very
similar
to
aroma
with
nice
amount
of
spice
and
hops
balancing
out
the
apple
pear
and
garpe
flavors
very
quaffable
nice
carbonation
up
front
with
sweet
alcohol
center
and
slight
dry
finish
try
this
at
a
time
when
no
one
is
talking
to
at
or
around
you
and
dont
take
a
shower
a
minimum
of
12
hours
prior
if
this
sounds
like
too
much
trouble
because
you
are
irresistibly
popular
or
just
too
important
do
us
all
a
favor
and
have
your
secretary
put
it
in
your
calendar
as
an
appointment
then
go
get
lost
in
your
own
eyes
and
die
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
nails
the
style
with
ease

mouthfeel

lively

detected
at

and
a
slight
citrus
astringency
that
lingers
at
the
finish
fairly
drinkable
but
this
one
may
have
been
past
its
prime
will
have
to
compare
with
a
fresher
bottle
d
easily
drinkable
the
yeast
and
hop
flavors
play
off
of
each
other
wonderfully
and
make
for
a
complex
and
very
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
great
all
around
love
to
drink
a
bottle
myself
but
it
ends
there
cant
go
beyond
a
glass
or
two
d
pretty
good
this
one
definitely
benefits
from
warming
up
a
bit
i
find
that
the
warmer
this
gets
the
mellower
it
becomes
but
that
may
just
be
true
with
all
beer
its
light
body
keeps
this
from
being
too
filling
thus
enabling
me
to
drink
more
overall
la
chouffe
is
a
unique
world
class
brew
the
true
champagne
of
bottled
beers
great
drinking
beer
as
to
be
expected
from
dachouffe
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definately
have
it
again
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
up
i
smelled
a
skunkiness
i
was
really
worried
it
was
a
really
old
one
or
it
somehow
got
crapped
up
but
i
think
its
ok
regardless
it
looks
fantastic
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
pure
white
sparkly
head
smell
is
fantastic
as
well
belgians
are
just
the
best
thing
ever
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
than
a
great
belgian
strong
ale
or
a
tripdubble
taste
just
makes
me
want
to
move
there
and
become
a
monk
and
swim
in
the
beer
i
really
dont
know
what
else
to
say
just
amazing
pale
blonde
fluffy
head
smells
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
fusel
alcohol
tasty
fruits
are
abound
and
the
body
is
kept
light
i
drank
this
at
my
local
corporate
200
tap
watering
hole
but
because
it
was
a
warm
day
and
work
was
over
it
hit
the
spot
solid
belgian
strong
pale
mouth
is
thin
and
slightly
oily
but
smooth
sweet
and
very
easily
drank
d
to
remain
rather
light
bodied
for
being
as
big
as
it
is
this
beer
wins
a
lot
of
points
in
my
book
couple
that
with
the
great
taste
and
you
have
for
yourself
one
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
worthy
of
multiple
return
visits
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
duvel
to
me
has
a
bit
more
flavor
but
this
isnt
far
behind
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
one
this
is
pretty
much
spoton
stuff
and
a
pleasure
to
consume
this
is
really
good
stuff
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
at
home
pours
a
light
but
cloudy
gold
body
with
a
decent
head
and
a
lace
ring
to
match
light
to
medium
bodied
a
great
fruit
citric
dark
heavy
all
rolled
in
there
taste
and
carbonation
that
dances
on
the
tongue
complimented
by
some
mild
maltiness
and
a
dry
backbite
that
seems
to
come
from
some
spices
for
a
very
smooth
very
lively
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
one
i
could
drink
drink
just
loved
it
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
wish
i
had
bought
the
bomber
instead
of
the
12oz
this
one
glass
is
not
enough
tastes
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
spices
yeast
slight
fruitiness
and
sweet
malts
notes
this
is
not
my
favorite
strong
pale
ale
but
a
very
good
example
none
the
less
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
is
decent
with
this
ale
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
rough
but
the
overall
taste
is
good
enough
to
warrant
trying
it
if
i
had
another
bottle
id
probably
age
it
for
6
months
possibly
longer
at
least
you
cant
tell
the
alcohol
content
had
another
two
months
later
and
didnt
seem
like
the
sugar
was
broad
faced
in
the
palate
as
much
as
before
nice
assistance
more
honey
like
more
pollen
like
quite
a
bit
better
still
would
recommend
for
the
american
hop
head
joe
ipa
try
the
de
dolle
dulle

more
interesting
hop
character
with
the
belgian
sugar
quality

it
is

a
goldenorange
color
bright
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
which
is
maintained
leaving
some
wonderful
lacing
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very

with
amazing

a

the
flavors
blend
nicely
sweet

yeast
semitart
fruits
with
a
floral

character
perhaps
a
bit
fragrant
again
at
first
it
all
seems
a
little
light
but
the
further
i
worked
through
the
beer
the
more
i
appreciated
its
delicate
nature
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
one
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
body
and
finishes
semidry
low
levels
of
delicate
carbonation
that
quickly
fade
and
leave
the

alcohol
isnt
hidden
all
that
well
however
its
presence
enhances
the
overall
experience
when
drinking
this
beer
its
warmth
adds
to
the
feel
and
semidryness
of
the
palate
its
taste
helps
to
balance
out
and
add
complexity
to
the
overall
flavor
this
is
one
ill
drink
again
one
ill
buy
again
and
one
ill
recommend
to
people
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
in
my
opinion
its
almost
a
mix
of
tripelthe
dominant
spicy
notes
mixed
with
a
belgian
strong
palethe
sweeter
notes
this
isnt
one
id
look
to
for
either
as
a
definition
of
a
style
but
it
is
quite
good
give
it
a
try
at
the
delirium
cafe
in
brussel
tripelish
hazy
gold
look
great
retention
aromas
of
banana
with
noted

almost
wheaty
exceptionally
easy

really
really
with

could
get
this

some

superrefreshing
this
could
be
a
very
unexpected
summertime
treat
this
is
something
ill
be
drinking
plenty
of
in
the
future
fantastic
belgian
beer
this
is
the
summer
brew
i
have
been
looking
for
several
months
now
i
would
consume
this
out
a
used
cowboy
boot
if
needed
absolutely
delicious
on
tap
at
ebenezers
in
a
tulip
purs
the
standard
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
spice
and
some
yeast
great
initial
flavor
sweet
with
a
bubble
gum
type
kick
really
refreshing
for
a
strong
pale
lots
of
flavor
and
a
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
a
classy
belgian
strong
pale
ale
comes
at
you
as
the
beer
warms
and
to
my
delight
is
not
overpowering
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
nice
light
belgian
that
i
really
enjoy
i
would
like
to
taste
this
and
duvel
together
see
what
i
like
better
the
flavor
is
fine
and
all
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
was
let
down
when
i
didnt
find
it
since
it
was
billed
as
a
belgian
ipa
i
guess
i
was
naive
about
how
the
style
would
probably
come
out
oh
well
it
felt
good
on
the
palate
but
was
just
too
sweet
to
make
it
really
drinkable
for
me
bought
at
the
local
supermarket
after
it
was
boughtout
by
a
french
megachain
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
modest
head
lots
of
lace
thought
the
aroma
is
quite
good
lots
of
floral
qualities
flowers
and
light
pale
malt
a
touch
of
hops
black
pepper
honestly
subtle
spice
and
yeast
the
aroma
provides
the
framework
for
this
brew
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
and
full
of
spice
nice
alcohol
warming
moderate
carbonation
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
the
beer
has
a
terrific
lingering
aftertaste
although
its
not
as
flavorforward
as
a
lot
of
great
belgians
this
beer
is
engaging
and
very
enjoyable
the
peppery
aspect
is
very
enjoyable
certainly
worth
having
again
d
this
is
an
excellent
and
very
drinkable
offering
i
will
be
seeking
more
of
this
one
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
hazy
toasted
straw
color
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
pure
white
head
that
left
rings
of
lace
as
it
dissipated
the
aroma
is
big
with
pale
beglian
maltyeast
corriander
tart
apple
juicyfruit
closer
to
the
wit
side
of
the
belgian
world
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
slight
belgian
yeast
spiciness
subtle
corriander
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
candi
sugar
a
touch
of
pepperearthiness
and
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
not
big
bold
bspa
flavors
but
clean
and
well
balanced
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
fizzy
carbonation
though
not
overly
carbonated
finishes
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
hides
the
boozahol
very
well
another
chouffe
winner
not
bold
bspa
flavors
but
perfectly
balanced
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
i
wish
my
bottle
wasnt
skunked
theres
gotta
be
something
to
make
these
guys
get
rid
of
green
bottles
one
of
my
favorite
styles
some
big
body
yet
an
easily
drinkable
beer
a
quaffable
sodapop
disguised
as
a
strong
belgian
ale
this
beer
hides
its
abv
very
well
a
fun
drink
that
reminds
me
of
a
creamsicle
only
without
the
stick
a
decent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
it
fails
to
capture
my
attention
drinkability
tried
this
after
researching
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
and
am
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
try
not
as
commanding
as
others
i
have
tried
in
the
same
family
but
nontheless
a
good
stronp
belgian
pa
d
due
to
the
abv
and
fizziness
i
could
probably
only
drink
1
pt
bottle
of
these
in
a
sitting
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
a
great
beer
though
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
going
belgian
with
a
smooth
and
pleasing
hop
presence
cheers
drinkability
i
know
this
is
popularbut
felt
it
was
overrated
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
beer
above
average
but
nothing
that
i
would
says
wow
you
have
try
this
on
tap
at
julians
in
providence
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
huge
white
head
aroma
of
banana
grass
yeast
and
citrus
flavor
of
grass
citrus
and
slightly
spicy
finish
is
slightly
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
nicely
complex
beer
hazy
pale
orange
ok
retention
smells
sweet
citrusy
coriander
coriander
definitely
present
in
the
taste
though
not
overbearing
citrusy
smell
becomes
more
of
an
orangelemon
tangy
bitterness
most
likely
imparted
by
the
hops
good
use
of
hops
sweetness
nicely
balanced
out
the
overall
zestiness
is
really
reminiscent
of
a
wit
beer
combined
alcohol
hops
and
high
carbonation
makes
the
liquid
dance
in
my
mouth
i
wouldnt
say
the
8
is
totally
unexpected
but
like
many
well
made
belgian
ales
it
really
doesnt
hurt
the
drinkability
recommended
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
very
carbonated
high
alcohol
punch
the
beer
is
a
delicious
warmer
that
is
definitely
a
sipper
had
this
with
fellow
ba
moxley
poured
from
a
petit
bottle
into
a
goblet
had
apricot
color
and
almost
very
little
head
that
settled
to
nothing
the
aroma
was
light
and
malty
but
the
taste
was
heavy
spice
up
front
with
light
malty
flavor
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
and
the
sediment
sips
saved
it
from
disapionting
to
acceptable
but
still
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
wish
i
had
ba
member
3080s
experience
with
this
one
maybe
we
had
a
bad
bottle
pretty
good
overall
but
second
tier
to
the
best
of
the
style
id
like
to
give
a
shout
out
to
ba
reviewer
3080
i
dont
think
anyone
can
top
hisher
review
of
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
impressive
hazy
blond
with
a
firm
even
white
head
leaving
an
even
sheet
of
lacing
covering
the
entire
walls
of
the
goblet
sweet
smell
of
apple
pear
apricot
and
peaches
the
taste
was
spicy
with
sweet
fruit
apples
white
grapes
and
hoppy
spice
with
a
slightly
dry
champagne
finish
heavy
carbonation
although
it
suits
this
beer
well
nice
sweet
mouth
coating
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
very
impressed
with
this
one
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
no
comment
on
that
little
fucker
on
the
bottle
i
wont
give
him
the
satisfaction
d
drinkable
yes
just
dont
think
i
could
put
these
away
all
the
time
this
beer
seems
on
the
verge
of
greatness
but
comes
up
a
little
short
a
touch
too
flat
and
watery
but
its
easy
to
drink
ill
give
it
that
and
ill
have
another
this
is
quite
refreshing
but
the
taste
is
incredibly
faint
seems
just
this
side
of
water
this
is
not
really
a
knock
but
im
kind
of
amazed
at
the
lack
of
definite
tastes
i
can
pick
up
in
this
its
not
like
a
poor
macro
lager
which
is
watery
and
sad
its
like
water
yet
light
and
crisp
i
was
pleased
that
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
on
tap
this
is
an
excellent
beer
although
its
funny
my
first
impression
was
that
it
tasted
and
smelled
a
bit
like
a
creamy
hefeweizen
it
tasted
a
bit
smoky
with
hints
of
peaches
and
bananas
it
had
a
delicious
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
hazy
gold
color
and
a
frothy
head
it
also
had
hints
of
spiciness
clove
and
pepper
with
a
light
hoppiness
to
the
finish
overall
a
really
excellent
drinkable
beer
it
also
makes
an
impression
on
tap
my
friends
and
i
are
still
discussing
this
brew
several
days
later
the
pour
was
a
bubbly
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
of
two
fingers
it
wreaked
of
citrus
and
honey
bitter
hops
citrus
honey
and
spices
were
all
present
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
great
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
go
after
this
beer
again
i
look
forward
to
trying
all
the
products
that
la
chouffe
makes
d
those
little
gnomes
really
know
how
to
make
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
will
appease
the
stodgiest
of
critics
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
creamy
head
into
a
chalice
the
smell
was
of
yeast
and
bubblegum
the
taste
was
of
candy
sugar
hints
of
apple
and
bubblegum
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
and
lacing
very
refreshing
for
a
strong
ale
a
solid
beer
m
d
a
liberal
carbonation
sizzle
over
the
tip
of
the
tongue
calms
through
the
body
wet
and
refreshing
tasty
enough
to
go
back
for
more
but
not
quite
big
bodied
enough
to
be
a
gentle
sipper
a
lot
of
flavor
and
alcohol
but
with
a
smooth
finish
i
could
drink
a
couple
and
i
recommend
trying
it
but
you
wont
see
me
having
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
night
la
chouffe
pours
a
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
sticky
head
that
lingers
nicely
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
sulfur
with
some
sweet
pale
malt
and
undertones
of
dry
chalky
yeast
and
esters
the
slight
skunkiness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
but
just
a
bit
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
more
of
the
light
yeasty
esters
i
dont
quite
taste
any
spices
but
i
think
thats
probably
evidence
of
good
light
spicing
its
there
but
not
dominant
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
its
unfortunate
that
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
as
im
sure
this
contributed
to
the
skunked
offflavors
poured
into
a
snifter
poured
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
slightly
orange
hue
to
it
nice
solid
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
great
lacing
aromas
are
of
sweet
citrus
honey
tropical
fruits
spices
nutmeg
anise
and
some
yeasty
esters
nice
citrus
flavor
on
top
s
well
as
tropical
fruits
being
all
over
this
one
some
nice
spices
like
clove
and
nutmeg
really
balance
this
out
light
mouthfeel
crisp
and
clean
with
a
great
carbonation
level
i
think
this
beer
is
outstanding
anything
by
chouffe
is
worthy
of
a
try
but
their
flagship
beer
is
very
delicious
extremely
drinkable
please
go
enjoy
one
of
these
if
you
havent
already
this
is
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
d
masks
its
8
abv
well
nice
fruity
aromas
and
tastes
make
this
a
nice
flavoursome
belgian
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
yes
ill
have
another
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
to
date
well
i
dont
know
that
im
of
right
mind
to
rate
its
drinkabilty
as
ive
nearly
polished
off
the
bottle
after
a
few
drinks
prior
and
am
reeling
just
a
bit
this
is
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
but
really
shines
i
think
when
paired
with
certain
foodstuffs
give
it
a
try
with
your
favorite
cheese
d
if
not
for
the
alcohol
content
would
make
the
ideal
session
beer
excellent
brasserie
dachouffes
dobbelen
ipa
was
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
their
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
one
didnt
disappoint
after
loving
their
last
two
samples
i
must
say
this
is
an
outstanding
brewery
specializing
in
some
real
authentic
outstanding
brews
that
really
hit
home
and
impress
with
their
distinctive
high
quality
pours
a
wonderful
golden
color
with
decent
foamy
head
serious
carbonation
is
visible
behind
a
grainy
strawcolored
hue
teriffic
ripefruit
smell
with
a
crisp
fresh
light
aroma
taste
was
full
of
grapefruit
bananas
sweet
candy
with
a
clear
crisp
flavor
full
of
yeast
the
8
abv
is
not
detected
behind
a
rich
conglomeration
of
fruitfilled
flavors
that
dance
on
the
tongue
amazing
rich
tasty
mouthfeel
with
ultraeasy
drinkability
that
goes
down
crisp
clear
clean
and
smooth
no
trouble
drinking
this
one
a
worldclass
brew
definitely
recommended
golden
straw
color
hazy
with
great
head
retention
almost
3
fingers
head
stays
for
pretty
much
the
duration
of
the
drink
loads
of
lace
along
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
peppery
hints
also
some
honey
taste
reflects
the
aroma
but
not
with
as
much
sweetness
as
i
would
have
expected
lots
of
fruit
flavoring
some
apple
and
citrus
along
with
some
honey
also
some
coriander
and
some
peppery
spice
however
the
fruity
flavoring
is
soon
subdued
by
a
dry
hoppiness
and
soft
alcohol
glow
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
reminding
me
a
little
of
a
duvel
but
full
and
coating
very
drinkable
8
is
not
incredibly
high
and
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
allow
for
continual
imbibing
contemplation
this
beer
had
a
relatively
heavy
body
which
is
somewhat
rare
with
these
belgian
golden
ales
i
am
hop
head
so
i
really
like
the
thickness
of
the
strong
american
ales
this
was
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
will
most
certianly
try
it
again
this
was
one
of
the
first
belgian
beers
i
really
liked
and
have
dismissed
it
for
the
past
67
years
i
must
say
ive
been
missing
out
a
bit
dissapointed
by
this
one
i
had
very
high
expectations
pourned
nicely
a
bit
hazy
but
nice
creamy
head
as
i
drank
the
bottle
i
could
see
the
extra
yeast
diposit
nice
spicey
aromas
and
flavors
definetely
on
the
dry
side
even
though
there
was
some
sweetness
as
it
mellowed
clearly
enjoyable
but
not
distinctive
too
much
competition
at
this
price
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
some
chunks
parmesan
peppercorn
baguette
the
peppercorn
works
well
with
the
dryness
and
hops
maybe
only
the
3rd
time
ive
had
this
brew
i
always
look
over
it
because
my
brew
stores
typically
only
carry
the
750s
and
i
try
and
get
smaller
bottles
because
my
add
tells
me
i
must
try
something
else
good
choice
even
though
the
nose
is
definately
lacking
hazed
orange
gold
with
a
white
head
nose
is
yeasty
and
citrus
flavor
is
strong
with
apparent
yeast
influence
and
a
minute
citrus
edge
sweet
but
not
overly
so
definite
influence
from
spices
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
feel
is
good
with
carbonation
pretty
standard
for
the
style
but
still
good
highly
drinkable
id
go
back
to
this
again
and
again
and
again
a
wonderful
belgium
girls
find
the
grimble
grumble
gnome
cute
biding
my
time
with
this
beer
i
find
it
lovely
opened
it
to
find
it
bubbling
out
into
onto
my
counter
quickly
into
my
glass
a
spiced
blondie
she
had
lots
of
carbonation
and
lots
of
suspended
yeast
best
i
could
tell
of
those
little
floaters
the
guy
who
devised
oberon
two
hearted
recommended
this
so
i
had
to
try
i
can
see
why
this
beer
would
be
amazing
on
draught
at
the
source
this
beer
ended
up
with
a
higher
rating
than
i
thought
it
would
when
i
first
tried
it
it
just
that
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
so
memorable
that
i
am
drawn
to
it
when
i
want
something
cool
not
much
more
to
say
besides
what
has
been
written
except
that
i
find
this
to
be
like
a
dumb
blond
chick
thats
good
in
the
sack
i
dont
want
to
marry
her
but
shes
great
fun
on
a
summer
day
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
and
for
the
style
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
smooth
definently
worth
the
price
for
an
easy
drinking
belgian
night
the
mouth
is
smoot
and
nicely
carbonated
flavor
boasts
spicy
sour
fruits
and
sweeter
malts
very
bitter
as
it
goes
down
which
accentuates
the
spice
profile
light
hops
also
make
an
appearance
la
chouffe
is
for
the
most
part
a
standard
belgian
golden
nothing
particularly
amazing
other
than
the
fact
that
its
brewed
by
dwarves
but
a
great
drink
none
the
less
it
pours
super
carbonated
but
a
suprisingly
small
head
for
a
golden
that
is
taste
is
basically
a
weaker
yet
smoother
version
of
the
dobbelen
ipa
triple
smooth
and
bubbly
taste
of
hops
and
has
almost
a
white
ale
twinge
to
it
clearly
belgian
in
character
good
brew
d
pretty
good
nicely
balanced
flavors
and
a
clean
dry
feel
make
this
one
go
down
pretty
easily
smell
of
faint
allspice
raspberry
malt
and
cream
the
taste
starts
off
light
and
tangy
with
carbonation
finishing
heavier
with
more
yeast
presence
nutmeg
and
citrus
i
dont
quite
like
this
as
much
as
their
double
ipa
tripel
but
it
is
very
good
this
gets
high
scores
across
the
board
i
cant
think
of
anything
i
dislike
about
this
beer
it
is
solid
through
and
through
i
wasnt
sure
what
i
would
think
of
this
because
i
had
already
sampled
achouffes
houblon
ipa
and
i
think
it
is
out
of
this
world
so
i
figured
this
might
bore
me
a
little
but
it
is
not
the
case
at
all
and
i
still
cant
get
over
how
easy
this
beer
is
to
drink
d
highly
drinkable
beer
delightful
to
drink
hazed
golden
color
vigorous
carbonation
supporting
a
nice
frothy
head
spicy
grassy
hop
aromas
meld
with
sugar
cookies
coriander
and
citrus
malt
sweetness
oranges
and
spicy
hops
with
fruity
esters
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
effervescent
body
crisp
and
fairly
light
good
stuff
i
like
this
beer
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
review
translated
from
french
792008
poured
from
a
755ml
bottle
labled
best
by
end
of
2008
into
a
pint
glass
huge
white
head
with
tiny
bubbles
that
lasted
a
while
lots
of
yeast
floating
in
the
glass
and
bottle
the
smell
is
spice
with
sweet
fruits
as
well
although
not
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
the
taste
is
very
complex
with
the
sweet
fruits
very
nice
spicyness
and
little
hop
bitterness
thrown
in
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
would
love
to
have
again
d
one
of
the
better
tasting
of
this
style
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
the
taste
is
pretty
good
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
an
enjoyable
brew
d
a
very
good
beer
from
the
la
brasserie
dachouffe
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
but
have
been
putting
it
of
for
a
while
if
youre
a
fan
of
yeasty
belgian
strong
ales
youll
enjoy
this
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
massive
bright
white
head
that
creamy
in
texture
with
the
resultant
lace
a
thin
slip
to
cover
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruity
sweet
and
a
slight
yeast
tone
also
noticed
lemonlime
crispness
seals
it
off
with
the
start
is
delightfully
sweet
delectable
are
the
malts
the
top
is
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
biting
in
its
acidity
the
hops
perfect
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
on
of
my
favorite
beers
from
brasserie
dachouffe
d
quite
smooth
for
8
i
would
definitely
like
another
fantastic
belgian
strong
pale
poured
an
orange
golden
colour
with
loads
of
yeast
bits
and
other
debris
floating
about
i
find
debrissediment
very
attractive
in
most
belgian
styles
and
this
certainly
has
plenty
smell
is
very
fruity
and
very
yeasty
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
but
you
really
have
to
be
looking
for
it
taste
too
is
fruity
and
yeasty
with
alcohol
that
is
difficult
to
detect
quite
drinkable
for
an
80abv
brew
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
not
so
much
due
to
the
alcoholic
flavor
allaround
a
great
belgian
beer
but
the
phenolics
take
over
and
make
it
something
that
you
cant
drink
all
day
very
impressive
beer
move
over
duvel
perhaps
not
quite
but
the
la
chouffe
offers
some
great
flavor
and
spice
thats
suprisingly
unique
its
a
wellbalanced
solid
offering
i
paid
6
for
about
a
12ounce
draft
so
at
least
in
this
instance
id
say
its
a
great
value
as
well
highly
recommended
petit
bottle
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
into
my
chalice
a
decent
whitish
head
receding
to
a
nice
film
a
bit
of
a
whirl
bringing
back
a
thick
carbonated
foam
there
is
a
lovely
use
of
spices
here
from
coriander
to
whatever
this
yeast
is
giving
off
in
addition
to
the
spices
from
hops
through
the
beginning
and
end
the
mouth
is
fairly
solid
well
carbonated
about
as
good
warm
as
cool
in
all
i
just
didnt
get
too
excited
over
this
one
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
perhaps
some
other
time
pours
out
a
brassy
gold
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
somewhat
clings
to
the
glass
no
lacing
to
speak
of
this
smells
overtly
of
coriander
the
pale
malts
come
through
but
the
spicing
is
a
bit
much
theres
some
booze
in
there
as
well
taste
has
the
same
things
going
on
as
the
aroma
especially
with
the
overspicing
along
with
an
overbearing
graininess
and
sweetness
theres
some
toastiness
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rather
sticky
and
prickly
not
impressive
got
this
one
at
my
bachelor
party
at
eulogy
in
downtown
philadelphia
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
big
bouncy
head
on
top
that
sticks
around
nose
is
nice
and
strong
spices
dominate
along
with
some
light
citrus
and
wheat
taste
is
fairly
similar
although
even
stronger
and
more
delicious
carbonation
is
strong
but
appropriate
to
the
beer
and
the
body
is
quite
full
and
tasty
this
ones
delicious
one
i
could
throw
back
a
bunch
of
if
it
werent
for
a
rather
high
abv
and
pricetag
chouffe
has
to
show
pours
a
hazy
golden
light
amber
color
with
a
large
finely
carbonated
head
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
covering
of
the
glass
there
is
moderate
to
light
lacing
this
is
an
amazingly
smooth
and
balanced
belgian
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
give
an
initial
hint
of
astringency
followed
by
a
mild
candy
sugar
and
fruit
taste
some
of
the
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
have
a
bolder
first
taste
but
would
not
stand
up
well
over
the
long
haul
this
would
be
a
great
belgian
starter
beer
there
is
no
overwhelming
astringency
or
sweetness
that
could
get
annoying
over
the
long
haul
la
chouffe
features
a
rich
mouthfeel
very
balanced
sweetness
astringency
and
no
alcohol
taste
drinkability
would
be
based
on
how
wasted
you
wanted
to
get
the
flavor
would
stand
up
fine
to
a
long
slow
disciplined
session
draught
eulogy
tavern
mine
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
definitely
some
spice
to
the
aroma
there
is
also
notes
of
fruit
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
is
slightly
beady
and
yeasty
with
hints
of
fruits
as
well
as
some
coriander
nice
medium
body
with
a
creamy
texture
average
carbonation
lots
of
flavors
present
pine
and
peach
combination
was
nice
nothing
overwhelming
very
drinkable
especially
during
summer
almost
reminds
me
of
duvel
notes
i
would
drink
this
all
day
on
a
hot
day
but
that
alcohol
content
sneaks
up
on
you
quick
i
may
pick
this
up
again
next
time
leaving
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
heavier
than
other
belgian
strong
pales
but
still
a
very
nice
and
complex
brew
wondrously
complex
and
very
well
flavoured
with
a
good
drinkability
for
an
8
abv
beer
only
downers
are
i
find
it
perhaps
a
bit
crowded
and
confusing
on
the
flavour
and
the
extent
of
the
murkiness
is
a
little
aesthetically
displeasing
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
not
as
highly
carbonated
as
the
appearance
would
lead
to
believe
almost
but
not
quite
creamy
finish
is
light
and
smooth
apparent
alcohol
but
easy
to
drink
even
when
warm
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
make
disappear
tasty
solid
for
the
style
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
belgian
beer
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
sweetness
with
a
good
deal
of
hop
backing
a
real
treat
from
belgium
drinkability
is
great
as
any
exceptional
bspa
should
be
in
my
opinion
youll
polish
off
the
750
with
ridiculous
ease
as
have
i
great
beer
cheers
this
one
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
went
about
90
away
pretty
quickly
the
nose
was
nice
but
not
heavenly
spicy
yeasty
and
a
little
peachy
the
taste
was
the
taste
was
also
spicy
corriander
pepper
with
a
slightly
peach
and
subtle
hop
flavor
but
the
pilsner
malt
was
really
cool
to
me
pretty
complex
but
not
over
the
top
mouthfeel
was
near
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
like
today
smooth
bubbly
unoffensive
a
great
strong
pale
ale
oelergud
certainly
a
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
but
i
wasnt
psyched
about
it
afterwards
its
good
but
not
on
par
with
some
other
belgian
pales
on
the
market
that
ive
recently
experienced
that
being
said
it
paired
well
with
a
mediumsharp
cheddar
hooks
5
year
sharp
drinks
a
little
slow
due
to
its
complexity
great
example
of
the
style
love
this
brewery
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
had
both
glasses
myself
just
a
bit
pricey
but
then
its
from
belgium
so
what
did
i
expect
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
we
went
to
belgium
last
fall
to
try
out
various
beers
and
never
came
across
this
wonderful
beer
it
wasnt
until
an
excursion
into
amsterdam
that
i
found
it
love
the
little
elfguys
on
the
bottle
the
beer
itself
has
a
lovely
color
and
the
taste
is
warm
and
spicy
thanks
to
coriander
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
most
belgians
are
and
i
love
sharing
this
with
friends
who
arent
as
in
to
beer
as
i
am
because
it
really
does
have
a
wonderful
taste
that
anyone
can
appreciate
im
not
always
a
big
fan
of
spiced
ales
but
dachouffe
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
a
truly
enjoyable
belgian
golden
with
clean
flavors
slightly
cloudy
reddish
gold
body
with
very
active
carbonation
under
a
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
cloves
dominated
the
smell
with
a
malty
biscuit
like
background
the
taste
is
a
very
good
mix
of
peppery
spices
and
pale
malts
it
has
a
very
good
balance
and
is
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
it
is
light
and
smooth
with
good
hit
from
the
carbonation
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
good
light
sweetmalty
beer
im
not
sure
how
it
compares
stylistically
to
other
spas
la
chouffe
calls
it
a
golden
ale
but
it
is
quite
tasty
in
its
own
right
recommended
nice
to
see
the
draught
version
around
these
parts
the
beer
as
remembered
is
a
run
for
the
top
spot
of
beerdom
the
pour
is
a
hazy
straw
with
hints
of
yeast
and
spiced
in
suspension
good
head
retention
and
solid
on
carbonation
promises
creaminess
and
richness
aromas
release
a
juicy
mouthwatering
plethera
of
ripe
fruits
sweet
malts
bold
esters
tartness
and
a
splash
of
honey
the
flavors
are
most
bold
with
fruit
flavors
of
peaches
pears
banannas
apples
lemons
appricots
mangos
bold
sweet
malts
swirl
around
the
fruits
and
lend
a
full
rich
cotton
candy
and
bubblegum
softness
backup
notes
of
clove
corriander
curraco
ginger
and
nutmeg
gives
a
ton
of
variety
to
the
brew
the
feel
is
an
anticipated
rich
smooth
velvety
blanket
across
the
palate
soon
washed
by
fruity
tartness
and
alcoholic
strength
finishes
with
a
mildly
dry
clean
fruit
flavors
simply
a
great
beer
d
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
less
hoppy
version
of
popperings
hommelbier
which
is
my
favorite
bpa
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
well
balanced
and
good
will
try
this
one
again
to
see
if
the
appearance
improves
with
a
better
bottle
overall
i
think
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
great
spices
is
sweet
and
still
have
a
great
hop
characteristic
dmiddle
of
the
road
this
is
clearly
a
good
beer
but
there
is
something
that
leaves
me
a
little
flat
compared
with
other
belgians
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lively
mouth
filing
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
really
good
and
i
think
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
isnt
my
favorite
chouffe
beer
but
its
still
better
thatn
most
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
and
yeasty
formations
if
you
let
the
beer
sit
for
a
few
minutes
sweet
citrus
smell
taste
is
crisp
spicy
and
less
sweet
than
the
bouquet
would
lead
you
to
believethough
there
are
still
hints
of
fruit
pear
white
grapewith
a
malty
aftertaste
this
is
a
drinkable
effervescent
beer
that
pairs
well
with
hard
cows
milk
cheeses
like
gruyere
on
tap
at
lucky
baldwins
in
pasadena
ca
poured
a
semihazy
dark
golden
with
a
nice
white
cap
smelled
quite
strong
of
fruit
taste
was
very
fruity
and
a
bit
dry
mouthfeel
was
very
light
carbonation
was
on
the
lower
side
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
kinda
got
bored
with
this
after
a
while
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
it
finished
clean
and
crisp
and
just
a
bit
sticky
on
the
palate
i
dont
usually
think
of
the
word
refreshing
to
describe
this
style
of
beer
but
la
chouffe
definitely
qualifies
cheers
notes
not
my
first
experience
with
this
ardenne
dwarf
but
certainly
my
best
enjoying
it
with
the
warm
sun
on
my
back
was
a
wonderful
way
to
spend
the
afternoon
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
fairly
light
and
with
a
moderate
pure
white
head
that
lasts
very
well
and
leaves
solid
lacing
smell
is
bright
and
spicy
coriander
cloves
and
pepper
with
banana
and
light
citrus
orange
and
lemon
and
some
yeast
and
breads
as
well
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
very
clean
and
bold
taste
is
rather
sweet
at
first
the
fruits
coming
through
and
malt
sugars
overwhelming
the
spicier
notes
coriander
in
the
finish
and
some
light
noble
hops
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
lacks
a
little
bit
of
body
and
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
enjoyable
and
well
put
together
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
often
even
if
it
isnt
anything
particularly
mindblowing
hazy
dingy
gold
body
slightly
chunky
topped
by
a
largebubbled
offwhite
head
head
shows
decent
retention
aroma
has
a
slightly
sweet
key
lime
note
really
clean
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
is
really
mild
with
a
smooth
creamy
body
individual
flavors
are
hard
to
pick
out
as
everything
seems
to
blend
together
maybe
a
bit
of
coriander
a
touch
of
honey
an
ever
so
slight
vanilla
note
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
its
impressive
because
it
is
so
well
crafted
most
beers
impress
by
bullying
your
taste
buds
this
is
subtle
the
pinnacle
of
balanced
flavors
mouthfeel
is
also
top
notch
very
light
very
quaffable
for
8
abv
i
think
this
was
3
for
the
bottle
best
3
ive
spent
on
a
beer
in
a
very
long
time
worth
twice
that
time
to
go
back
and
try
mc
chouffe
as
well
i
guess
drinkability
to
much
of
this
and
youre
sure
to
be
burping
but
an
excellent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
very
pleasant
tasting
a
very
solid
belgian
ale
great
color
and
even
better
aromas
yeast
is
subdued
but
definately
there
as
well
as
a
welcome
amount
of
spice
very
complex
early
on
with
some
interesting
combination
of
tangy
and
sweet
peppered
with
a
slight
burn
great
carbonation
extremely
easy
to
drink
way
too
fast
light
and
satisfying
when
its
available
on
tap
jump
at
the
chance
to
sample
poured
from
an
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
there
was
thin
frothy
head
was
rather
lasting
in
a
razor
thin
form
on
top
a
rich
golden
brew
with
some
sediment
noticeable
floating
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
was
a
nice
mix
of
spices
light
biscuitty
malt
with
a
crisp
yeast
bite
taste
was
much
of
the
same
with
some
nice
vanilla
characteristics
the
carbonation
was
just
right
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
by
an
appropriate
level
of
sweetness
very
enjoyable
brew
if
your
willing
to
pay
for
it
this
beer
was
served
in
a
chalice
with
one
of
the
smoothest
looking
golden
hues
ive
ever
seen
pale
goldenyellow
tones
fill
the
glass
as
a
pearl
white
head
rests
comfortably
on
top
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
the
smells
were
of
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
spice
and
yeasty
tones
this
beer
had
matching
flavors
as
a
light
creamy
vanilla
rides
into
a
malty
biscuit
like
finish
the
mouth
feel
from
this
tap
production
was
incredibly
smooth
with
a
lightermedium
body
this
beer
paired
very
well
with
traditional
fish

im
dying
to
try
it
with
a
plate

not
all

very
drinkable
particularly
when
colder
the
flavor
is
very
rich
malty

peppery
herbal
flowery

there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
which
gives
the
brew
a

there

wow
what
a
great
beer
not
sure
i
would
have
this
again
it
is
good
but
there
are
definitely
better
choices
out
there
best
before
2009
this
was
a
christmas
present
from
my
loving
girlfriend
pour
carefully
as
there
is
a
good
amount
of
sediment
a
belgian
ale
with
a
pilsnerlike
hop
bite
and
a
healthy
dose
of
pilsner
malt
reminds
me
very
much
of
an
american
double
pilsner
the
yeast
character
is
decidedly
of
the
ale
variety
with
esters
of
flowers
sweet
and
breadlike
strong
body
like
a
bock
i
dont
know
but
many
qualities
i
percieve
as
lagerlike
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
i
may
prefer
the
draft
version
more

without
a
doubt
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
and
one
of
my
favorite
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
hours
logged
in
at
essex
ale
house
in
nyc
where
the
brasserie
dachouffe
draught
beers
are
well
represented
and
served
with
style
75cl
green
bottle
from
florians
in
auburn
golden
translucent
body
with
an
inch
or
so
of
white
head
and
small
bits
of
what
is
presumably
yeast
floating
suspended
in
the
body
smells
hoppy
citrusy
and
piney
tastes
sweet
citrusy
piney
yeasty
and
spicey
surprisingly
refreshing
for
the
abv
alcohol
flavor
is
only
there
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
alcohol
warming
is
there
light
bodied
and
pleasant
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
fantastic
im
impressed
d
good
drinker
but
alcohol
character
too
noticeable
a
good
beer
from
a
style
i
like
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
type
drinkability
good
interesting
belgian
strong
pale
ale
certainly
worth
a
try
viva
la
chouffe
d
not
one
of
my
favorite
chouffes
too
much
like
the
rest
of
the
golden
ale
pack
with
out
enough
individuality
warm
finish
a
very
nice
trip
this
beer
pours
a
wonderful
hazygolden
color
a
tremendous
amount
of
bubbles
rest
on
top
of
the
brew
after
its
poured
and
they
continue
to
rise
long
after
the
pouring
has
stopped
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
a
big
whiff
of
hops
and
spices
the
taste
is
terrific
seems
to
be
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
malts
and
carbonation
also
well
balanced
the
taste
starts
with
fuggles
hops
then
in
creeps
the
zesty
lemon
flavor
the
end
result
is
a
wonderful
synergy
that
amounts
to
a
tremendous
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
the
flavor
was
malty
and
sweet
with
orange
rind
apples
and
peach
spices
like
clove
and
cinnamon
carried
through
the
finish
allong
with
some
alcohol
all
of
the
sweet
fruityness
was
nicly
ballanced
with
hops
making
this
a
very
pleasant
beer
can
an
elf
be
cozy
i
think
so
because
this
may
not
be
flashy
but
it
warms
and
lulls
and
caresses
its
so
nicely
blended
that
nothing
stands
out
but
the
sum
is
an
enjoyable
end
result
the
abv
is
well
disguised
and
it
just
warms
the
drinkability
youre
indeed
welcome
in
my
lair
anytime

hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
i
wouldnt
pass
this
beer
up
for
anything
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
or
if
youre
searching
for
a
good
gateway
beer
into
belgians
then
you
simply
cant
pass
up
this
beer
the
8
alcohol
is
really
deep
in
the
flavor
and
barely
noticeable
so
multiple
refills
is
definitely
an
appealing
concept
with
this
fantastic
biere
overall
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
has
the
nice
mix
of
fruitiness
and
spiciness
that
i
like
in
the
style
a
too
quick
pour
into
my
la
moneuse
tulip
lets
a
bit
of
chunky
sediment
into
the
glass
i
usually
forget
to
decant
belgians
the
beer
forms
a
slowfalling
twofinger
head
just
offwhite
the
beers
body
is
a
bright
orangegold
and
visibly
carbonated
the
lacing
is
also
quite
dense
the
nose
is
bright
full
of
green
apples
grass
a
bit
of
citrus
peach
sweet
and
a
bit
peppery
but
there
also
seems
to
a
green
vegetable
scent
like
asparagus
that
messes
things
up
a
bit
i
like
asparagus
just
not
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
alcoholic
at
first
but
overshadowed
by
the
asparagus
flavor
i
noticed
before
ends
fairly
bitter
terrible
mouth
is
medium
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
not
as
forward
as
i
thought
it
would
be
still
this
beer
tastes
horrible
so
i
must
have
a
bad
bottle
right
nonetheless
ill
review
and
wait
for
another
try

a
neat

from

and
quite
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a

with
lots
of
sediment
swirling
around
the
thick
off
whitepillowy
head
formed
nicely
in
my
stone
imperial
russian
stout
glass
smelled
very
spicy
with
a
hint
of
old
beer
it
tasted
fantastic
low
carbonation
spicy
lightly
alcoholic
it
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
i
would
have
to
say
very
drinkable
cant
wait
to
finish
the
bottle
cheers
to
the
gnomes
d
its
nice
bold
and
spicy
but
the
abv
means
im
not
drinking
a
ton
of
these
as
a
sippin
beer
it
does
the
trick
full
of
fruity
and
spicy
flavors
blooms
wonderfully
and
very
strong
beer
with
a
sweet
molasses
taste
no
head
to
speak
of
served
in
a
half
pint
tulip
glass
very
rich
and
filling
to
drink
i
did
like
the
taste
but
it
has
more
of
an
evening
ending
kind
of
taste
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
have
this
with
food
we
werent
eating
at
the
moment
and
were
also
a
little
ways
into
an

this
beer
poured
a
brilliant

color
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
i
had
to
scoop
from
the
glass
to
keep
from
running
over

very
spicy
with
notes
of

equally
impressive

peppery
with
flavors
of

belgian
candi

and

was
fairly
light

such
a

pretty
high
another
fine
beer
from
d
achouffe
d
very
tasty
and
light
with
a
good
kick
to
it
i
could
definitely
stick
with
this
one
for
a
long
time
but
its
a
bit
pricy
to
drink
several
of
them
in
an
evening
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
as
nice
as
it
is

d

id
want
to

this
at
the
beginning
of
a
night
and
not
return
to
it
later
on
a
real
treat
experience
served
from
a
dusty
bottle
nevertheless
when
the
cap
popped
off
it
foamed
like
champagne
served
in
a
wine
style
grottenbier
glass
it
had
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
lasted
throughout
with
little
lacing
also
to
note
lots
of
yeast
deposits
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
which
some
made
to
the
glass
so
it
was
a
little
cloudy
with
all
the
deposits
floating
around
the
aromas
were
delightful
smelled
delicious
very
fruity
it
is
a
smooth
ale
with
hints
of
spice
fruity
taste
yet
even
with
the
high
abv
it
is
unnoticed
till
it
hits
ya
and
you
have
to
check
go
ba
what
the
abv
is
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
too
much
of
these
at
one
time
but
its
definitely
a
tasty
belgian
ale
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
with
some
white
grapes
some
cheddar
and
stilton
cheese
and
crackers
extremly
drinkable
if
only
i
could
get
this
in
my
state
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
ruby
hues
the
head
is
large
fluffy
and
bright
white
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
citrus
faint
caramel
and
more
yeast
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
bit
harder
to
appreciate
due
to
way
too
much
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
medium
bodied
with
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
covered
up
too
much
by
the
carbonation
i
would
drink
it
again
and
certainly
enjoy
it
however
there
are
better
belgain
strong
pale
ales
out
there
the
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
presents
itself
as
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
just
a
bit
of
haze
big
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
nose
is
of
spices
and
fruit
primarily
quite
lively
palate
is
interesting
indeed
hoppier
than
expected
this
one
is
quite
fruity
some
citrus
light
malts
and
candy
sugar
sweetness
in
there
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easily
inbibed
clean
finish
im
a
pretty
big
duvel
fan
i
can
prove
it
i
pronounce
it
correctly
and
this
is
somewhat
duvellike
definitely
not
a
copy
though
give
this
one
a
try
or
two
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
fan
of
belgian
beer
drinkabilityoverall
not
quite
as
dynamic
or
assertive
as
it
is
ontap
perhaps
due
to
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
a
while
still
a
hallmark
example
of
the
style
that
ill
always
enjoy
great
beer
period
try
it
as
a
postscript
i
was
surprised
by
the
unfiltered
solids
at
the
bottom
i
should
have
been
paying
attention
this
last
quarter
of
the
bottle
turned
the
dials
up
to
11
amplifying
the
bitter
and
spicy
tastes
more
heavily
astringent
and
alcoholic
with
a
strong
taste
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
drinkability
different
to
la
chouffe
on
tap
where
there
are
more
prominent
fruits
and
malts
on
display
from
the
bottle
this
emphasizes
spices
and
bitter
finish
after
drinking
this
i
could
see
why
garrett
oliver
might
want
to
call
this
a
saison
rather
than
a
golden
ale
or
a
strong
pale
ale
i
definitely
prefer
this
on
tap
though
the
bottle
was
definitely
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
one
important
note
this
was
my
second
beer
of
the
evening
after
a
hockley
dark
5
but
ended
up
being
my
last
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
lightweight
that
i
am
i
wasnt
up
for
more
after
finishing
this
off
alone
very
nice
overall
an
impressive
belgian
drinkability
overall
a
worthy
session
beer
light
cheeses
and
pasta
might
accompany
this
best
great
beer
but
im
telling
nothing
new
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
offering
i
had
no
problems
what
so
ever
downing
the
big
bottle
by
myself
but
now
im
feeling
the
effects
i
recommend
this
little
gnome
strongly
d
this
beer
had
some
nice
smooth
sweet
flavors
and
a
good
complexity
but
the
fizz
in
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
overpowering
but
im
not
sure
if
it
would
have
been
overly
sweet
if
that
was
not
there
a
nice
belgian
pale
solid
and
drinkabale
recommended
to
any
belgian
beer
afficionado
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
another
great
offering
from
achouffe
a
good
solid
belgian
pale
beats
many
of
them
handsdown
id
have
to
rate
it
above
duvel
and
la
fin
du
monde
and
some
of
the
more
commerciallyavailable
brands
perhaps
if
youre
couchbound
for
a
night
even
a
sessionable
ale
poured
a
lovely
hazy
golden
color
with
subtle
white
hues
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
white
bubblelaiden
head
that
seemed
to
sit
patiently
for
quite
some
time
a
touch
of
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
goblet
aromas
of
honey
alcohol
and
candy
seemed
to
come
out
the
alcohol
seemed
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
just
terrific
with
loads
of
flavors
fruit
flavors
seemed
to
work
well
with
the
added
spices
a
bit
of
hot
pepper
added
even
more
depth
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
soft
bitter
finish
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
could
have
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
no
problem
taste
was
merely
a
refelection
of
the
smell
herbal
with
distinct
coriander
notes
and
probably
some
other
herbs
in
there
biterness
was
nicely
balanced
a
lot
of
triple
style
beer
can
learn
something
from
this
bitterness
it
is
a
bitterness
that
makes
me
crave
for
another
sip
and
adds
that
little
extra
to
a
beer
there
is
also
a
hoppy
and
hopherbal
taste
which
give
the
beer
a
certain
complexity
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
drinkability
was
excellent
maybe
a
little
too
good
i
finished
a
750
ml
bottle
in
30
minutes
good
stuff
edit
after
putting
the
rest
of
the
bottle
in
w
yeast
its
not
surprisingly
much
more
opaque
mouthfeel
is
much
fuller
and
taste
sweeter
and
mellower
and
the
problem
with
floaties
has
gone
away
seems
to
be
more
warming
as
well
that
could
be
because
ive
had
half
the
bottle
though
i
would
recommend
having
this
one
with
the
yeast
in
after
carefully
pouring
most
of
the
bottle
and
doing
the
swirling
the
lees
around
trick
to
dissolve
the
floaties

p
crux
solid
belgian
strong
ale
but
i
dont
know
i
expected
something
different
i
guess
with
the
bottle
littered
with
words
like
artisanal
mysterious
poured
a
orangetan
color
with
a
fluffy
cap
that
stacked
in
the
glass
active
effervesence
aromas
of
sweet

spice
citrus
and
some
must
great
malt
spine
soft

feel
great
whack
of

balanced
by
the
medicinal
spiciness
of
the

citrus
peel
wet

with
a
tart
after
taste
a
great

ill
have
to
see
what
happens
with
later
pours
but
if
the
entire
bottle
tastes
like
the
first
yeastfree
pour
i
imagine
this
is
the
ultimate
belgian
session
brew
8abv
notwithstanding
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
id
have
no
problem
putting
a
few
of
these
back
much
to
my
later
chagrin
im
sure
i
really
have
enjoyed
the
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
this
beer
was
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
and
wonderful
carbonation
it
had
a
sweet
spicy
odor
the
taste
was
wonderful
spicy
some
fruit
lemon
with
a
warm
hoppy
finish
very
nice
a
great
beer
to
drink
update
after
20
odd
more
glasses
yes
i
am
a
lush
but
this
stuff
was
on
tap
for
only
3
bucks
i
have
increased
drinkability
to
5
and
the
taste
to
4
5
from
4
i
love
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
the
best
thing
i
like
about
the
lachouffes
is
the
bottle
art
something
about
little
gnomes
who
make
beer
is
quite
appealing
indeed
they
are
just
cute
as
buttons
on
the
bottle
i
wish
i
owned
one
so
he
could
brew
beer
at
my
beck
and
call
maybe
i
can
find
one
under
the
bridge
behind
my
house
d
not
my
favorite
belgian
by
any
stretch
but
fans
of
the
style
will
like
it
a
bit
like
a
belgian
pale
cross
with
a
witbier
mouthfeel
is
decently
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
spicy
perfumelike
aroma
with
a
touch
of
citrus
rind
pale
gold
color
with
the
obligatory
two
finge
thick
fluffy
belgian
head
very
clean
feel
in
the
fore
and
the
flavors
are
somewhat
medicinal
and
very
floral
mild
notes
of
chamomille
and
lavendaer
and
more
of
the
citrus
rind
im
instantly
a
big
fan
of
this
one
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
i
think
the
wicked
carbonation
could
get
old
after
a
while
i
was
at
monks
cafe
this
weekend
and
continued
on
my
quest
to
expand
my
knowledge
of
belgian
beers
i
ordered
a
la
chouffe
and
it
came
to
me
in
a
tulip
glass
on
tap
it
started
out
with
a
nice
white
head
that
faded
a
little
too
quickly
but
was
beautiful
none
the
less
it
smelled
of
pears
and
pepper
along
with
other
fuits
and
spice
i
couldnt
quite
pin
down
it
was
very
intriguing
and
begged
me
to
dive
in
it
tasted
of
the
same
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
dry
spicy
finish
again
more
generic
spice
and
fruit
that
i
unfortunately
cant
nail
down
more
specifically
the
mouthfeel
was
simultaneously
light
and
creamy
active
carbonation
added
to
the
dry
perception
and
made
it
a
very
lively
drink
i
have
to
say
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
one
and
i
will
be
trying
it
from
the
bottle
very
soon
got
a
bottle
of
2003
nice
i
may
have
to
crack
that
soon

also

nicely

very
unique
flavor
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
was
not
that
complex
but
masked
the
alcohol
very
well
this
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
solid
and
dependable
brew

champagne
like
perhaps
a
bit
too
fruity
but
still
a
tasty
beer
although
i
found
the
fruityness
refreshing
and
different
at
the
begining
it
became
a
bit
annoying
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
to
me
is
your
average
sweet
belgian
pale
ale
stuff
its
good
very
tasty
good
aroma
nice
belgian
funkiness
pretty
well
balanced
nothing
over
the
top
but
id
drink
it
anytime
well
worth
seeking
out
dont
ignore
the
other
belgian
biggies
but
add
this
to
the
list
of
things
to
respect
and
enjoy
frequently

subtle

a
touch

the

well

becomes
a

still
immensely
drinkable

enjoyable
i
had
the
entire
bottle
and
would
probably
have
another
were
it
in
the
house
cheres
this
is
the
third
or
so
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
its
the
first
time
i
can
say
ive
really
enjoyed
it
all
i
can

is
that
this
is
a
good
one

one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
thus
the

the
flavor
never
gets
old
and
it
is
so
complex
that
you
almost
discover
another
nuance
each
time
you
drink
some
the
alcohol
doesnt
rear
its
head
either
which
allows

to

and
at

youll
be
feeling
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
some
of
the
better
tripels
like
st
bernardus
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
md
very
light
on
the
palate
making
it
so
easy
to
drink
yet
the
drawback
is
that
it
turns
a
bit
watery
and
thin
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
the
rich
flavour
dissipates
overall
this
is
a
mediumbodied
belgian
pale
ale
so
light
as
well
as
delicious
despite
its
high
alc
strength
very
solid
and
enjoyable
the

is
of
not
too
sweet

along
with
some

750ml
is
no

this
is
another
one
of
those
belgians
that
i
just
havent
gotten
around
to
trying
until
the
other
night
at
the
publick
house
its
really
good
too
kind
of
on
the
golden
side
for
a
belgian
pale
cloudy
with
a
big
head
looks
nice
in
the
little
gnome
glass
smell
and
taste
are
all
over
the
place
and
pretty
complex
while
not
overwhelming
sweet
spicy
notes
take
over
clashing
with
the
herbal
whispy
hops
yeasty
and
estery
doughlike
with
some
nice
almost
citrusy
or
slightly
sour
qualities
that
sort
of
remind
me
of
a
nice
saison
definately
an
interesting
beer
id
like
to
try
it
in
the
bottle
some
time
because
i
think
that
sort
of
conditioning
seems
to
do
these
kinds
of
beers
a
lot
of
good
either
way
this
is
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
and
overall
ahhh
the
classic
la
chouffe
while
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
this
one
is
a
keeper
full
of
flavor
and
complexity
but
still
one
you
could
consume
for
a
while
definitly
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
nice
medium
activity
that
doesnt
interfere
whatsoever
with
the
pleasant
tastes
thick
and
rolling
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
solid
belgian
a
bit
strong
for
a
second
helping
but
nevertheless
a
very
drinkable
brew
two
thumbs
up
pale
orange
with
bubbles
moving
upwards
for
quite
some
time
after
pouring
with
a
rocky
head
like
meringue
sp
or
whipped
egg
whites
smells
of
yeast
and
orange
zest
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
quick
light
spritz
in
the
middle
smooth
taste
with
a
zesty
wang
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
middle
is
downright
juicy
with
tropical
fruit
finishes
dry
truly
lovely
and
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
notes
after
trying
la
chouffe
i
am
a
little
disappointed
as
bspas
are
my
favorite
style
and
after
seeing
the
high
overall
score
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
however
im
sure
my
displeaure
is
simply
a
matter
of
personal
opinions
as
many
other
more
experienced
bas
have
rated
this
one
high
all
in
all
quite
different
and
a
beer
im
sure
many
enjoy
the
flavor
and
lack
of
a
lasting
head
however
dont
do
it
for
me
will
probably
try
again
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle

alcohol
also
adds
some
more
body
to
this
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
i
couldve
drank
a
750
ml
of
this
but
unfortunately
i
only
had
a
330
ml
i
will
definitely
get
more
next
time
vive
la

this
one
is
sort
of
a
cloudy
golden
orange
in
colour
horse
blanket
aromas
dominate
with
notes
of
citrus
mild
malt
and
yeast
the
flavors
are
surprisingly
mild
but
in
a
good
way
there
is
an
interesting
spicecitrus
interplay
and
the
body
is
fuller
than
expected
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
but
who
am
i
to
argure
this
stuff
is
still
wicked
good
seems
like
it
could
be
better
with
a
bit
of
age
a
little
young
but
a
very
good
beer
ive
gone
with
a
5
for
drinkability
but
a
750
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
or
shared
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
it
could
get
dangerous
viva
la
chouffe
this
is
a
most
drinkable
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
very
refreshing
the
carbonation
gives
this
one
an
almost
champagne
like
mouthfeel
very
clean
a
good
one
to
pair
with
a
cheese
and
fruit
plate
smells
like
a
lager
smells
like
beer
this
wasnt
nearly
as
fragrant
or
spicy
as
i
expected
or
would
have
liked
all
in
all
this
reminds
me
of
what
i
remember
of
duvel
this
is
practically
a
high
class
malt
liquor
or
a
strong
euro
lager
pretty
well
balanced
on
the
whole
very
dry
and
quite
drinkable
not
as
interesting
or
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
this
could
quite
possibly
convert
a
fan
a
macros
but
for
the
money
there
are
many
other
brews
id
rather
have
d
its
a
bit
expensive
in
australia
what
can
i
say
on
tap
served
perfectly
in
the
correct
glassware
in
gollem
it
doesnt
get
much
better
flavor
explodes
with
the
first
sip
into
a
floral
sweetness
and
a
warming
burst
of
alcohol
nice
basic
hop
presence
here
adds
a
bit
of
green
to
the
party
needs
some
warming
time
ticktock
honey
emerges
and
satisfies
nicely
crisp
and
smooth
with
some
tingle
in
the
cheeks
yeasty
bready
quality
fills
me
up
like
a
nice
hunk
of
artisan
bread
a
bit
hot
for
8
0
and
thats
the
only
negative
i
can
even
fathom
in
this
beer
one
of
two
beers
that
hooked
me
on
craft
brews
and
a
goodbyeohio
staple
near
perfect
notes
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
for
the
summer
like
a
saison
with
some
spice
mouthfeel
is
good
at
firstcreamy
but
flattens
more
than
i
would
expect
as
the
session
progresses
very
tasty
but
the
alcohol
hinders
its
drinkability
somewhat
i
took
the
cap
off
a
750ml
of
this
beer
and
i
instantly
remembered
the
last
time
i
had
a
sip
several
months
ago
this
pour
to
a
finely
bubbled
giant
white
foamy
head
and
a
beautiful
yelloworange
color
there
is
a
taste
of
apples
and
coriander
at
the
start
and
the
first
few
sips
have
a
hoppy
rust
taste
to
them
which
recedes
as
you
polish
of
the
pint
and
a
half
this
has
a
bitterness
which
is
not
unwelcomed
the
bottle
says
spiced
and
certainly
this
does
not
mean
nutmeg
cinnamon
or
clove
there
is
a
floral
nose
with
a
definite
citrus
and
lemony
quality
there
is
some
great
drinkability
and
even
though
it
is
not
as
creamy
as
duvel
or
delirium
tremens
for
instance
it
has
a
peppery
spice
that
makes
it
a
beer
to
return
to
bottle
after
bottle
looking
forward
to
brewing
with
this
yeast
a
solid
thick
looking
dark
orange
carbonation
and
particles
floating
around
it
vaguely
reminds
me
of
an
underwater
scene
in
the
frigid
climes
except
beer
the
nose
is
spiced
oranges
and
cinnamon
to
me
almost
like
mulled
wine
ingredients
before
theyre
added
to
wine
yeasty
thick
a
bit
of
spice
some
hop
no
real
kick
to
it
though
not
as
much
as
id
expect
from
the
visuals
and
nose
certainly
complex
and
good
tasting
but
nothing
outstanding
at
least
in
the
bottle
form
the
feel
is
thick
and
juicy
it
makes
me
want
more
regardless
near
perfect
except
for
this
sligh
oily
sensation
it
leaves
behind
that
i
cant
place
obsurdly
drinkable
for
the
content
difficult
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
wonderful
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
spicy
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
merely
average
especially
considering
the
high
abv
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
especially
considering
that
i
loved
the
mcchouffe
if
you
can
get
both
try
the
mc
first
and
dont
feel
too
guilty
if
you
manage
to
skip
this
one
imo
notes
addictive
taste
if
you
can
get
it
without
the
skunk
took
a
little
while
to
warm
up
to
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
stuck
with
it
first
impression
served
too
cold
ill
admit
was
that
it
was
too
sweet
the
spicing
heavyhanded
and
the
alcohol
too
prominent
at
the
front
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
and
it
warmed
the
beers
complexity
came
through
the
sweetness
receded
and
the
spices
sorted
themselves
out
with
coriander
and
orange
peel
taking
the
lead
surprisingly
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
became
less
strident
in
character
and
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
was
liking
it
quite
a
bit
drinkability
hello
summer
beer
great
job
on
this
one
full
of
scent
and
flavor
drinkability
great
very
tasty
and
smooth
this
is
an
absolute
textbook
bspa
which
is
a
bit
of
a
curse
its
so
bythebooks
that
its
hard
to
get
too
excited
about
it
its
an
excellent
beer
and
ive
scored
it
as
such
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
going
to
change
your
life
if
youve
never
had
a
belgian
beer
this
would
be
a
great
place
to
start
i
find
myself
craving
a
nice
belgian
strong
more
often
than
not
these
days
and
la
chouffe
has
successfully
reminded
me
that
my
quest
to
find
these
beers
should
continue
definitely
worth
looking
for
this
one
poured
into
a
big
burgundy
glass
cloudy
hazy
peach
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
gobs
of
bubbles
smell
was
clove
and
spices
and
yeast
and
candy
this
beer
was
wonderful
spiciness
carbonic
bite
and
belgian
yeasty
flavor
are
perfectly
mixed
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
is
oh
so
easy
to
drink
rivals
its
more
well
known
style
partner
duvel
excellent
beer
looks
nice
smells
nice
tastes
good
i
think
ill
let
the
next
bottle
sit
a
little
longer
though
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
the
bottle
but
is
absolutely
a
cant
miss
on
tap
my
first
bottle
was
a
disappointment
but
who
knows
how
long
it
had
been
on
the
shelf
later
bottles
were
much
better
750
ml
crown
capped
silk
screened
bottle
purchased
at
total
wine
in
chesapeake
va
thick
foamy
white
head
on
top
of
a
golden
yellow
pour
fruity
delicious
notes
in
the
nose
on
top
of
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
yeast
flavor
is
full
of
herbal
and
fruit
flavors
most
notably
some
apple
and
a
bit
of
pear
backboned
by
some
sweet
vanilla
flavors
dry
on
the
mouth
as
it
finishes
smoothly
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
certainly
one
ill
go
back
to
when
i
want
something
with
a
bit
of
a
punch
that
still
leaves
a
fairly
light
impression
on
the
tongue
one
final
piece
of
advice
be
very
careful
with
food
pairings
on
this
beer
pair
it
with
something
light
or
youll
miss
out
on
all
of
the
subtleties
it
offers
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
rash
of
rounder
sweeter
belgians
that
i
have
been
drinking
lately
it
had
a
cutting
sharpness
that
ripped
right
through
the
sweetness
that
did
little
more
than
provide
balance
its
biggest
detriment
was
that
the
alcohol
came
through
a
little
too
strong
at
times
la
chouffe
is
a
complex
wellcrafted
belgian
ale
a
fine
example
of
the
strong
pale
ale
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
and
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
rest
of
the
brasserie
dachouffe
line
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
unfilteredunpasterized
ale
and
i
certainly
was
very
impressed
it
was
so
very
cloudy
that
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
i
saw
the
sediment
floating
around
in
it
but
dont
let
its
different
appearance
fool
this
is
one
high
class
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
continue
to
drink
nice
and
fizzy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
tasty
and
delicious
pours
a
pale
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
foamy
head
with
diminishes
to
a
layer
of
bubbles
and
leaves
foam
down
the
glass
subtle
nose
of
spices
and
hint
of
malts
the
taste
is
of
spices
some
cloves
malt
and
hints
of
peach
and
apricot
a
lovely
effervescent
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
very
complex
yet
subtle
flavours
im
certainly
going
to
be
coming
back
to
this
one
good
strong
pale
ale
ill
have
to
try
this
again
somewhere
down
the
road
poured
from
a
750
ml
capped
green
magnum
best
before
date
on
the
label
says
2007
bought
with
the
chouffe
gift
pack
so
of
course
i
poured
it
into
the
accompanying
la
chouffe
stemware
a
deep
hazy
gold
in
colour
quite
brilliant
in
its
lustre
for
a
hazed
beer
with
a
massive
spongelike
head
that
maintains
impressive
retention
i
almost
need
a
shovel
to
make
a
path
through
it
to
the
actual
beer
there
is
a
very
mild
aroma
but
it
seems
to
draw
me
in
with
every
inhale
a
lot
of
complexity
to
something
so
subtle
lemon
and
tangerine
zest
bubblegum
esters
fresh
grass
and
then
the
spices
coriander
black
pepper
some
nutmeg
and
even
cinnamon
to
my
surprise
the
flavour
is
light
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
this
is
quite
an
uplifting
beer
im
sampling
this
after
an
unsavory
day
at
work
and
it
has
completely
managed
to
perk
me
up
light
grains
and
yeast
at
first
with
a
quick
appearance
of
orange
sweetness
in
the
middle
then
gaining
some
bulk
on
the
finish
with
the
spices
first
coriander
and
cloves
with
black
pepper
lingering
on
the
aftertaste
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
as
the
mcchouffe
didnt
impress
me
much
ive
certainly
been
missing
out
this
past
while
in
this
case
as
inexplicably
annoying
as
i
find
gnomes
i
can
easily
overlook
that
personal
bias
when
it
comes
to
la
chouffe
ill
definitely
be
picking
more
up
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
a
new
beer
cheered
me
up
so
much
drinkability
is
high
the
abv
is
not
really
noticeable
so
i
suggest
sharing
with
friends
to
keep
yourself
off
the
floor
outstanding
the
mild
spiciness
reminds
me
of
unibroue
don
de
dieu
in
particular
bright
and
fizzy
nice
aroma
starts
it
off
smooth
and
refreshing
matched
up
well
with
the
steak
and
shrimp
we
had
for
dinner
doesnt
have
quite
the
tartness
of
a
saison
but
pretty
similar
in
taste
ive
seen
this
many
times
and
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
a
nice
way
to
mark
my
300th
attempt
at
a
review
heres
to
many
more
i
cant
believe
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
i
opened
it
with
the
intention
of
sharing
but
had
to
go
it
alone
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
a
well
balanced
thirst
quencher
i
recommend
sharing
this
with
friends
if
you
have
to
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
refreshing
pale
malt
scent
with
a
wonderfully
fruity
and
tart
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
outstanding
it
has
a
very
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
warm
but
nothing
too
harsh
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
to
good
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
it
has
great
aroma
and
taste
an
excellent
sessions
brew
after
trying
duvel
i
knew
that
belgians
had
won
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
la
chouffe
has
made
even
more
room
the
thick
pillowy
head
was
a
wonderful
sight
and
the
lacing
did
not
quit
a
little
citrus
orange
it
seemed
to
mecombined
with
that
peppery
undertone
yeah
thats
the
stuff
and
the
carbonation
was
fantastic
its
right
up
there
with
duvel
though
i
find
duvel
just
a
bit
smoother
definitely
another
fun
brew
nice
ale
i
had
this
ontap
at
eulogy
large
creamy
head
this
beer
has
a
nice
estery
character
but
it
could
be
so
much
more
bottleconditioned
would
be
the
preferred
way
to
go
with
this
one
very
good
ontap
i
would
assume
it
would
have
much
more
complexity
in
the
bottle
in
my
minds
eye
i
picture
that
tasting
wonderfully
a
lot
of
belgian
beers
are
that
way
remember
ontap
is
not
always
better
bright
mildly
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
and
champagne
bubbles
no
lace
on
the
glass
the
only
negative
i
can
write
at
this
time
aroma
of
bright
citrus
a
little
hop
flower
maybe
grass
not
much
lace
bright
citrus
tang
on
the
flavor
a
little
hop
bitterness
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
belgian
pale
rather
than
a
gold
ale
nice
light
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
the
dachouffe
brewery
does
it
again
really
a
nice
belgian
blondetriplegolden
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
definitely
one
of
the
finest
beers
from
the
brewery
folks
this
is
a
keeper
it
truly
is
an
artisanal
beer
and
one
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
enjoy
a
great
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
first
belgian
i
really
loved
good
beer
the
next
time
i
see
it
ill
be
sure
to
bring
some
home
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
lots
of
lemon
and
lime
going
on
its
slightly
sweet
as
well
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
more
citrus
fruit
coming
through
a
very
pleasant
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
great
for
an
8
brew
a
damn
fine
beer
thanks
to
christina
for
this
one
she
made
a
wonderful
selection
my
lovely
wife
brought
this
beer
to
the
beer
tasting
shes
trying
really
hard
to
get
into
beer
so
that
she
understands
what
im
talking
about
with
flavors
and
aromas
i
really
respect
her
for
taking
interest
in
my
hobby
and
respect
her
choice
of
beer
as
this
was
a
champ
the
beer
poured
a
yellow
color
with
golden
hues
and
a
strong
one
finger
head
that
wouldnt
go
away
for
anything
the
nose
was
full
of
lemony
and
peppery
notes
wtih
a
really
sweet
background
i
think
this
would
be
nice
to
marinade
some
chicken
the
flavor
was
nice
sweet
lemon
that
finished
peppery
and
spicey
and
refreshing
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
damn
what
a
fine
beer
i
will
be
visiting
this
one
again
in
the
summer
but
i
dont
think
ill
share
my
bottle
pouring
from
the
750
ml
bottle
into
a
chalice
glass
the
beer
is
indeed
cloudy
as
the
bottle
states
cloudy
despite
being
vertically
stored
in
my
cellar
for
2
weeks
and
poured
without
disturbing
the
lees
interesting
honeyed
wheat
orange
browns
with
a
whipped
cream
white
head
tight
and
small
bubbled
screen
lacing
that
ever
so
slowly
dissipates
tiny
bits
of
sediment
are
visible
in
the
beer
wow
another
incredible
aroma
from
chouffe
mild
but
extremely
appetising
fruits
up
front
clean
fresh
bread
baked
sweet
cinnamon
rolls
definite
cinnamon
itself
spicy
herbs
some
metallic
notes
once
it
has
warmed
a
little
sweet
icing
sugar
a
cranberry
or
pomegranate
seed
tartness
some
detergent
soapiness
and
clove
taste
is
not
strong
at
all
but
extremely
flavourful
lightly
roasted
malt
in
the
front
faint
smoked
hints
in
the
middle
are
some
wheat
notes
and
also
some
coriander
similar
to
a
good
wit
some
orange
marmalade
in
the
finish
and
grapefruit
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
for
fruit
flavours
definite
orange
flavours
and
even
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
only
faintly
could
i
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
in
the
feel
it
is
most
definitely
therewarming
and
smooth
the
aftertaste
is
mainly
sweet
and
phenolic
hops
only
peeking
their
heads
through
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
balancing
this
beer
so
it
is
not
overly
sweet
their
role
here
is
balance
not
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
creamfilled
foamy
and
mediumbodied
this
is
one
8
brew
i
could
drink
quite
happily
through
an
entire
night
without
it
becoming
too
overpowering
undeniable
drinkability
marks
this
would
pair
splendidly
with
a
dry
cheese
or
aged
cheddar
nuts
of
all
sorts
would
accompany
this
nicely
as
well
this
beer
pours
a
flourescent
golden
color
with
a
medium
airy
white
head
a
small
layer
of
foam
lies
above
the
liquid
smell
is
spicy
and
earthy
taste
begins
fairly
basic
but
the
further
i
go
the
deeper
and
more
complex
lots
of
noticeable
pale
malts
and
a
light
crisp
body
upfront
coriander
and
orange
peel
seem
to
come
in
and
mix
well
with
the
malts
the
yeast
is
interesting
and
seems
to
be
more
flavorful
the
more
i
drink
it
finish
is
light
dry
and
semifruity
not
a
real
sweet
beer
but
not
real
dry
either
this
one
has
a
good
balance
flavors
are
delicate
but
work
nicely
ive
drank
this
beer
twice
and
both
times
i
get
a
flavor
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
and
i
think
its
from
the
yeast
strain
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
keep
drinking
it
until
i
figure
it
out
ive
had
la
choufee
a
number
of
times
and
it
never
disappoints
the
complex
flavor
and
golden
color
are
hard
not
to
love
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
available
today
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
with
a
golden
orange
color
and
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
fresh
with
a
yeast
smell
the
nose
is
also
bready
with
the
smell
of
rosated
sunflower
seeds
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
afruity
diesters
all
the
way
through
its
clean
on
the
palate
and
does
not
get
too
sticky
on
the
palate
pours
a
slightly
dark
orange
red
with
a
thick
tall
head
smells
of
fruit
and
spice
first
sip
is
slightly
sweet
ending
with
a
background
of
spice
and
slight
bitterness
finishes
dry
the
flavors
are
ok
but
too
much
spice
is
in
the
background
and
not
enough
flavor
in
the
middle
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
but
it
was
ok
the
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
given
how
light
this
beer
feels
on
the
palate
im
glad
that
i
gave
this
a
try
but
nothing
really
blew
me
away
enough
to
have
it
again
nice
appearance
both
in
and
out
of
the
botle
nice
and
white
foam
but
not
clear
sight
under
it
fine
nose
but
too
much
fruityness
of
koreander
in
it
nice
taste
lots
of
fruit
but
again
a
sweet
koreander
taste
further
a
clean
and
litle
bitter
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
than
just
one
75
cl
botle
at
once
on
a
nice
warm
evening
but
in
my
eyes
too
spicy
and
misses
bitteness
to
make
to
one
of
the
best
in
this
category
effervescent
lively
yellowish
beer
with
a
big
head
a
little
hazy
but
fairly
clear
aggressively
aromatic
lemon
mashed
peaches
and
a
certain
spicy
crispness
the
level
of
spiciness
in
this
beer
that
i
cant
even
begin
to
discern
the
varied
flavors
orange
peel
peach
lemon
coriander
cinnamon
yeast
they
form
a
sort
of
belgian
beer
yogurt
with
this
beers
creamy
mouthfeel
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
maybe
too
much
so
but
theres
no
hint
of
the
8
anywhere
to
be
found
this
beer
begs
to
be
shared
so
everyone
can
experience
the
job
and
so
the
original
drinker
doesnt
go
into
some
sort
of
spice
coma
intense
biting
hops
and
alcohol
bitter
orange
peel
and
cloves
i
almost
thought
grapefruit
tart
feeling
sort
of
lame
dry
mouth
notes
of
grapefruit
definitely
this
time
pomegranite
tart
feeling
a
little
heavy
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
color
with
a
huge
eggshell
white
head
spicy
honeylike
aromas
lemon
zest
pepper
and
the
fiantest
hint
of
spearmint
leaves
fairly
yeasty
and
hoppy
as
well
drinks
with
the
crispness
a
pilsener
but
its
a
lot
stronger
initially
malty
and
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
then
immediately
gets
spicy
and
dry
carbonic
acid
notes
from
higher
carbonation
level
wonderfully
earthy
like
a
spring
meadow
after
a
shower
i
think
ive
tried
it
enough
times
to
say
that
its
a
classic
ah
my
first
chouffe
beer
it
poured
a
cloudy
golden
yes
i
poured
the
yeast
in
as
well
with
a
large
3
finger
white
head
that
had
massive
staying
power
and
also
left
a
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
my
glass
nose
is
full
of
spice
cinnamon
and
clove
notes
dominate
the
aroma
taste
is
nicely
balanced
a
little
hoppy
bite
balances
out
the
clovelike
spiciness
of
this
beer
alcohol
is
hardly
detectable
finishes
slightly
sweet
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
almost
overcarbonated
a
very
solid
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
chouffe
products
as
soon
as
i
can
find
them
bottle
poured
an
hazy
blonde
ale
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
aroma

this

pale
with

not
bad

not
great
kind
of
middling
worth
a
try
i
suppose
cheers
o
this
beer
tastes
a
little
sweeter
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
as
it
doesnt
have
any
associated
dryness
it
seems
to
taste
like
a
hybrid
between
a
belgian
strong
a
pale
ale
and
a
dubbel
pours
an
orangey
straw
color

a
finger

that
dissipated

the

has
the
classic
belgian
funk
to
it
along
with
a
perfumed
scent
that
adds
to
the
funkiness
the
flavor
profile
has
belgian
yeast
merged
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
overall
mildly
complex
and
easy
drinking
thinner
in
body
than
i
would
have
thought
still
the
story
of
this
beer
is
how
malty
it
is
like
that
of
bread
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
next
to
no
head
or
carbonation
on
this
one
a
dark
gold
color
as
would
be
expected
for
the
style
next
to
no
lacing
medium
light
penetration
perhaps
it
was
just
my
bottle
but
i
got
next
to
no
aromas
on
mine
i
get
notes
of
honey
almost
like
a
green
tea
and
lemon
possibly
some
coriander
or
cinnamon
goes
down
okay
at
first
but
with
the
spices
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
end
overall
this
beer
was
okay
i
remember
having
it
years
ago
and
it
tasting
much
better
maybe
i
had
an
off
bottle
but
if
this
is
the
consensus
of
most
people
i
have
not
read
other
reviews
i
can
not
say
i
would
be
running
out
to
get
more
of
this
personally
i
got
this
in
a
6pack
sampler
from
a
friend
for
christmas
its

the
other
flavors
while
decent
were
overwhelmed
in
my
opinion
o
an

ale
with

belgian
characteristics
but
not
quite

quality

a

on

with

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice

but
the
flavors
are
more

without
any
real

aspects
that
i
get
from
the
smell

rich
burnished
copper
with
a
quickly
receeding
off

it
coats
the
mouth
with
tart
apple

brightness
all
in
all
leaves
me
alert
but
wanting
more
a
solid
offering
o
a
decent
bspa
that
delivers
great
yeast
spice
and
fruit
this
is
a
great
go
to
beer
that
doesnt
break
the
bank
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
with
some
belgian
characteristics
but
not
in
the
same
category
as
the
great
belgian
beers
of
the
style
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
present
than
i
would
enjoy
i
found
the
website
the
brew
is
just
very
new
not
on
ba
yet
i
still
dont
like
it
it
could
be
great
but
there
is
just
a
nasty
little
smelltaste
that
is
giving
me
much
hesitation
im
trying
to
be
fair
with
each
drinktaste
and
the
weird
thing
is
it
is
a
fishy
tastesmell
i
dont
know
what
more
to
say
i
have
23
down
and
im
going
to
toss
the
rest
i
dont
know
how
to
rate
this
one
i
get
the
distinct
style
and
taste
of
a
brewer
and
i
appreciate
that
but
i
dont
like
this
at
all
can
i
give
it
a
2
for
the
abv
and
for
what
i
percieve
to
be
a
nice
attempt
i
like
the
write
up
on
the
website
i
get
the
description
there
is
just
a
funky
little
taste
spice
that
ruins
it
for
me
and
maybe
this
review
belongs
in
a
new
format
as
i
interpret
it
to
be
a
new
brew
rather
than
the
one
pictured
but
look
how
much
i
described
in
fairness
to
the
brew
i
tried
to
be
fair
somebody
send
me
a
line
if
you
disagree
please
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
a
fine
but
full
carbonation
a
very
easy
to
like
winter
option
overall
a
pretty
good
representation
of
a
belgian
style

this
is
a
decent
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
doing
everything
more
or
less
right
but
its
not
really
bringing
anything
new
or
notable
to
the
table
either
its
also
surprisingly
boozy
for
the
size
which
doesnt
particularly
bother
me
but
its
a
little
unexpected
all
in
all
its
a
decent
belgian
pale
thats
not
quite
bspa
but
a
little
strong
in
character
and
content
for
a
bpa
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
fresh
wheaty
smell
some
candy
spice
and
zesty
pours
into
the
perfect
pint
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
and
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
zesty
hoppiness
the
taste
gets
drier
in
the
middle
then
finishes
with
a
flat
sweet
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
this
is
a
great
holiday
winter
warmer
with
lots
of
zest
and
fresh
flavor
overall
i
have
to
be
honest
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
than
i
did
the
taste
is
subtle
but
id
like
a
belgiumstyle
with
a
more
substantial
flavor
overall
its
not
bad
but
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
am
positively
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
better
than
expected
very
drinkable
medium
to
light
winter
warmer
great
job
tasty
blend
good
lunchtime
brew
overall
pretty
good
stuff
the
scent
was
nice
and
the
taste
had
a
little
bit
of
a
funk
that
made
it
interesting
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
id
drink
it
again
anytime
overall
this
genre
seems
to
vary
quite
a
bit
with
some
more
on
the
saison
side
some
on
the
tripel
side
and
others
on
the
belgian
strong
ale
side
this
one
is
more
in
the
tripel
realm
by
my
tastes
o
not
bad
and
not
great
was
nice
to
get
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
rush
back
to
try
it
again
o
not
quite
sure
why
this
is
a
winter
reserve
i
can
picture
having
this
beer
year
round
i
like
this
more
than
their
other
belgian
style
ales
lots
more
distinct
flavors
overall
not
bad
quite
good
actually
pours
a
bright
orange
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
on
my
snifter
glass
smell
is
grass
hops
fruit
not
bad
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
best
in
the
style
category
the
taste
is
just
not
right
for
this
style
to
me
yeast
alcohol
are
added
to
the
nose
profile
but
its
way
too
sweet
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
the
feel
is
thin
syrupy
with
a
little
bit
of
an
undercarbonated
vibe
overall
this
is
fairly
mediocre
probably
wont
look
for
this
again
cheers
very
good
would

a
6
pack
worth
trying
once
at

o
meh
im
not
disappointed
i
bought
it
but
im
not
thrilled
either
nothing
special
here
o
not
bad
at
all
but
it
doesnt
really
impress
me
having
said
that
id
be
willing
to
give
it
a
second
chance
if
it
were
served
at
room
temperature
otherwise
this
isnt
something
ill
purchase
in
the
future
o
this
is
fantastic
american
made
belgian
style
beer
good
complexity
and
great
mouthfeel
like
the
best
from
belgium
have
ill
be
buying
this
every
christmas
as
long
as
its
available
o
the
head
and
lacing
were
lacking
but
everything
else
about
this
ale
was
pretty
good
i
liked
this
slighly
better
than
the
père
noël
o
a
nice
beer
at
is
enjoyable
i
feel
that
if
it
was
made
stronger
and
had
more
flavor
this
could
be
a
great
beer
i
will
probably
pick
this
up
again
a
good
tasting
beer
which
i
failed
to
mention
has
a
sweet
aspect
too
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
year
round
medium
bodied
with
a
zesty
spice
presence
thats
countered
by
light
fruit
bready
yeast
and
biscuity
malt
some
coriander
up
front
followed
by
hints
of
apple
and
pear
followed
by
a
strong
bread
and
pale
malt
character
the
bready
yeast
and
malt
backbone
add
fullness
to
the
palate
but
the
abv
is
well
masked
making
this
beer
easy
to
drink
not
overly
complex
but
a
decent
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
if
the
yeast
they
used
in
the
bottle
did
their
job
the
carbonation
is
sort
of
light
and
would
have
been
welcome
to
cut
into
the
sweetness
the
head
is
nearly
nonexistent
and
the
sweetness
tells
me
that
the
attenuation
was
sort
of
low
despite
the
7
2
id
love
to
test
the
bottles
i
got
to
see
if
it
actually
attained
that
abv
as
i
didnt
sense
much
alcohol
at
all
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
or
my
state
of
sobriety
o
a
brilliant
belgianstyle
ale
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
ff
why
this
is
associated
with
winter
idk
its
light
enough
to
drink
any
time
o
a
solid
winter
offering
for
those
who
do
not
want
to
be
totally
assaulted
by
a
winter
lager
not
one
id
seek
out
but
definitely
one
id
enjoy
seeing
at
my
hometown
dive
bar
which
generally
has
the
worst
beer
selection
ever
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
very
little
head
which
dissipates
quickly
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
smells
mainly
of
cloves
light
in
taste
the
cloves
are
very
faint
on
the
palate
to
be
fair
it
was
a
light
mouthfeel
for
a
semihigh
abv
overall
nothing
too
offensive
but
also
not
too
rememberable
pours
hazy
golden
with
smallish
white
head
nose
has
breadyyeasty
qualities
but
somewhat
light
overall
trying
to
see
how
his
example
fits
he
style
some
candyish
flavors
on
palate
with
hops
in
balance
complex
different
some
alcohol
warmth
is
noted
and
detracts
from
drinkability
o
decent
beer
nothing
i
will
remember
or
grab
for
again
the
label
read
bottle
conditioned
belgian
style
ale
and
so
i
went
with
a
gentle
pour
to
avoid
stirring
up
the
lees
this
not
only
meant
mere
wisps
in
terms
of
the
head
but
the
color
was
still
a
hazy
orangishyellow
nose
had
a
tropical
fruit
quality
along
with
a
general
mustiness
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
the
alcohol
was
upfront
and
immediate
followed
by
a
general
fruitiness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
with
the
yeasty
mustiness
really
taking
hold
i
fail
to
understand
why
this
is
a
winter
reserve
it
would
be
a
reasonable
beer
any
time
of
year
although
one
or
two
at
time
would
be
plenty
overall
a
solid
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
and
fairly
simple
not
a
ton
going
on
but
not
bad
at
all
o
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
enjoyable
the
smell
and
flavor
blended
a
sweet
and
spicy
flavor
very
well
id
definitely
recommend
any
beer
drinker
try
it
the
palate
is
a
step
up
with
the
blend
of
floral
and
stone
fruit
character
overcoming
the
stark
simplicity
of
the
malt
character
a
little
spicy
even
with
a
touch
of
mace
present
again
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
furthering
the
spicy
aspect
mildly
sweet
sugary
in
nature
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
ultimately
this
is
too
simple
to
be
a
true
grand
cru
but
is
a
solid
effort
closer
in
spirit
to
duvel
green
rather
than
the
regular
duvel
if
that
helps
poured
orangebrown
with
a
slight
white
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
spices
and
malts
in
the
nose
pretty
dry
and
almost
bland
tasting
but
somehow
still
good
i
guess
the
complexity
wins
it
over
malts
yeast
some
nonthreatening
spice
and
floral
accents
medium
mouthfeel
and
moderately
drinkable
but
probably
not
memorable
enough
for
more
than
a
glass
overall
this
is
pretty
good
not
up
to
the
best
belgian
standards
but
i
would
drink
it
again
o
didnt
wow
me
but
was
very
solid
easy
drinking
and
at
7
2
could
be
a
little
dangerous
would
drink
it
again
on
the
whole
quite
complex
good
brew
what
the
heck
is
this
stuff
i
saw
te
word
grand
cru
on
the
tap
handle
and
i
get
something
pale
yellow
maybe
ive
lost
touch
with
reality
here
but
i
always
thought
that
a
style
of
beer
like
that
has
some
form
of
complexity
and
some
blood
sweat
and
tears
put
into
it
the
guy
hands
me
my
sample
and
i
just
gave
him
a
look
back
like
wtf
is
this
it
actually
had
me
a
little
upset
i
know
flying
fish
is
capable
of
making
good
brews
check
out
their
exit
series
i
was
just
stunned
by
the
lack
of
everything
not
put
into
this
brew
i
couldnt
say
much
about
this
if
i
tried
the
beer
was
yellow
and
light
bodied
seriously
a
winter
grand
cru
impossible
drinkability
i
dont
like
drinking
this
beer
i
bought
2
cases
of
this
stuff
because
it
was
on
sale
and
the
lady
at
the
liquor
store
told
me
it
was
a
really
good
beer
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
having
to
finish
those
2
cases
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
i
never
expected
this
in
a
grand
cru
d
this
is
a
good
beer
it
tastessmellslooks
good
drinks
easy
etc
if
only
it
didnt
have
the
potential
to
be
so
much
greater
i
would
have
nothing
to
complain
about
with
a
few
tweaks
this
brew
could
be
phenomenal
d
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
all
that
special
either
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
again
thinner
medium
body
decent
carbonation
pretty
dry
and
lingering
on
the
palate
drinks
nicely
definitely
one
of
the
better
strong
ff
offerings
overall
yet
another
solid
brew
from
them
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
almost
no
head
to
be
seen
a
few
bubbles
can
be
seen
moving
up
through
the
body
but
what
little
foam
they
produced
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
aromas
are
not
unlike
those
of
a
witbier
cloves
yeast
oranges
banana
peels
good
stuff
flavors
are
good
and
predominantly
sweet
i
get
a
lot
of
bubblegum
and
candy
flavors
from
the
belgian
yeast
the
body
is
just
a
mess
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
it
feel
flat
and
sticky
and
kills
the
drinkability
of
an
otherwise
goodtasting
beer
pity
semisweet
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
a
sticky
and
mediumfull
body
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
light
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
clove
and
coriander
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
and
very
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
the
aroma
coming
off
of
this
one
was
quite
excellent
to
say
the
least
for
the
style
very
good
flavor
but
it
just
seemed
to
lack
in
complexity
for
me
with
that
said
this
was
still
very
nice
and
a
really
good
winter
brew
from
flying
fish
i
like
this
one
very
easy
drinking
and
a
decent
beer

a
reasonable
price

off

some

only
adds
to
this

complexity
d
nicely
drinkable
id
likely
pick
this
up
again
if
i
saw
it
d
this
was
a
decent
bspa
but
nothing
special
while
exit
4
was
totally
offstyle
this
was
almost
too
by
the
book
with
nothing
unique
about
it
it
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
it
wasnt
very
complex
or
interesting
good

not
great

overall
a

for
the
holiday
season
notes
very
pleasant
glass
of
beer
i
like
flying
fish
and
this
was
a
well
balanced
refreshing
brew
from
them
overall
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
since
i
liked
their
dubbel
and
this
came
recommended
but
i
was
completely
let
down
it
tasted
bland
for
what
it
should
have
been
after
a
second
bottle
to
confirm
that
it
wasnt
a
fluke
the
rest
were
reserved
for
cooking
drinkabiliy
very
tasty
and
welldone
brew
i
think
it
fits
the
style
very
well
complex
enough
for
reviewing
and
critiquing
but
at
the
same
time
tasty
enough
to
just
relax
and
enjoy
drinkability
a
very
good
belgian
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
way
too
well
a
nice
holiday
treat
that
i
wish
i
could
find
around
here
i
would
get
a
six
without
hesitation
drinkability
on
this
brew
is
quite
decent
its
goes
down
pretty
easily
which
is
impressive
this
with
this
style
of
brew
if
you
never
drank
belgian
style
brews
this
is
a
great
brew
to
begin
with
its
a
great
representation
of
the
brew
without
being
overpowering
like
many
other
brews
in
the
style
a
great
brew
pours
golden
with
a
light
head
and
some
scattered
lacing
nice
belgian
yeasty
smell
but
light
notes
of
clove
apple
and
some
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
some
nice
lingering
bitterness
almost
tannic
very
dry
with
more
apple
notes
and
yeasty
a
delightful
beer
and
priced
well
drinkability
doesnt
come
close
to
the
better
beers
in
this
style
a
good
beer
to
drink
but
it
falls
apart
if
you
drink
it
critically
ive
been
working
my
way
through
a
6
pack
trading
off
between
raison
detre
from
dogfish
currently
drinking
out
of
a
tall
pilsner
glass
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
with
your
eyes
closed
it
smells
like
delerium
tremens
and
has
a
similar
taste
with
less
of
the
boozy
smack
in
the
face
nice
carbonation
almost
no
head
looking
forward
to
working
through
more
flying
fish
flying
fish
is
new
to
ga
so
i
have
been
working
my
way
through
the
lineup
must
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drank
from
a
tulip
glass
poured
clear
golden
with
little
head
that
of
which
disappeared
very
quickly
taste
was
spot
on
with
the
smell
citrus
flavors
with
mild
hops
and
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
drank
with
a
fresh
slice
of
pizza
you
would
have
thought
the
two
came
together
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
down
for
6
9
abv
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
thats
not
crazyhigh
on
the
alcohol
scale
but
as
tasty
as
this
is
and
as
easy
as
it
drinks
i
know
that
im
drinking
this
way
too
fast
while
im
reviewing
it
i
could
see
myself
putting
a
couple
of
these
away
after
a
long
day
and
passing
out
in
front
of
the
fire
awesome
thanks
again
chris
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
flying
fish
i
wouldnt
cross
the
street
to
buy
any
but
its
drinkable
and
inoffensive
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
flavor
brings
forward
a
lot
of
yeast
character
with
some
spicy
zest
and
a
bit
of
pear
lemon
and
melon
the
yeast
is
definitely
the
dominant
character
here
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
not
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
not
a
terrible
effort
but
when
judging
by
the
style
this
just
really
does
not
stack
up
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
good
yeast
fruit
spices
lots
of
flavor
feels
full
bodied
and
tasty
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
selection
buy
this
every
year
and
it
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
smell
is
wonderful
and
the
after
taste
has
a
hint
of
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
to
it
but
im
sure
that
comes
from
the
hops
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
on
the
east
coast
pours
nice
a
tad
cloudy
but
that
didnt
bother
me
nice
lacy
head
and
a
great
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
great
beer
i
would
certainly
buy
yearly
drinkability
this
woul
dbe
a
good
thanksgiving
beer
with
light
body
and
tons
of
fruit
and
spice
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
stand
out
flavor
this
a
very
nice
beer
but
nothing
too
distinctive
i
think
grand
cru
winter
reserve
was
a
better
beer
out
of
the
gate
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
when
it
lands
on
our
fair
shores
of
south
carolina
the
nose
right
now
is
by
far
the
best
thing
going
curious
to
revisit
this
soon
the
cru
shines
solid
gold
pouring
with
a
bubbly
head
that
poofs
out
into
a
ring
in
no
time
no
kidding
the
aroma
is
jello
shot
a
mix
between
orange
and
cherry
vaguely
cinnamon
spicy
actually
i
could
also
take
the
angle
that
it
smells
like
a
bubblegummy
malt
liquor
and
its
all
lusciously
appealing
a
firm
spicy
bite
tickles
the
tongue
before
a
warming
wave
of
fruit
bubblegum
and
notsodry
champagne
wash
through
feels
soft
and
cheaply
silky
again
like
the
best
3
champagne
around
im
a
bit
stunned
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
tasty
and
soothing
likely
the
best
domestic
grand
cru
label
ive
come
across
in
memory
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
really
not
something
id
come
back
to
very
often
decent
flavor
but
it
has
some
flaws
that
hurt
the
drinkability
and
nothing
stands
out
enough
to
make
me
say
hey
i
want
more
of
that
i
wonder
if
its
better
on
tap
poured
a
filtered
golden
hue
with
one
finger
of
white
head
average
retention
and
good
lacing
smelled
of
sweet
candied
pears
apple
and
sugar
and
not
as
much
spice
as
i
was
led
to
expect
the
taste
yielded
a
nice
fruitysweet
blend
which
progressed
to
a
slightly
spicy
and
sweet
finish
spritzier
than
expected
blending
nicely
with
the
medium
body
good
session
belgian
but
would
benefit
tremendously
from
a
little
more
spiciness
and
a
little
less
sweetness
d
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
a
slightly
sweet
beer
thats
more
lightweight
than
bold
in
flavor
probably
good
with
almost
any
meal
would
be
great
with
a
burger
on
a
hot
day
or
any
fish
or
chicken
dishes
maybe
even
good
with
a
light
dessert
flying
fish
belgian
grand
cru
winter
reserve
wont
make
anyone
forget
the
best
belgian
or
belgianstyle
ales
in
the
world
that
said
its
worth
at
least
a
single
for
those
who
love
the
style
and
those
who
have
a
soft
spot
for
aggressively
flavored
ale
single
from
the
foodery
nl
philadelphia
if
this
is
their
grand
cru
im
not
sure
i
want
to
try
anything
else
from
flying
fish
md
nicely
carbonated
as
it
should
be
consistency
is
medium
but
the
weight
of
the
alcohol
is
clearly
felt
despite
its
omission
from
the
taste
enjoyable
but
this
seems
a
bit
undermalted
and
overspiced
however
the
hops
add
a
nice
flavor
to
the
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
number
of
these
and
they
are
tasty
enough
to
want
to
do
so
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
has
a
nice
gold
color
with
very
few
white
bubbles
taste
is
kind
of
like
raisin
bread
smell
is
like
a
spicy
malt
feels
nice
and
bubbly
to
sip
goes
down
smooth
enough
to
have
a
couple
while
watching
a
long
movie
it
also
is
nice
with
an
italian
sandwich
i
like
my
beers
to
have
the
appropriate
alcohol
to
taste
proportion
big
flavor
beers
need
to
be
bigger
alcohol
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
have
enough
big
flavor
for
the
big
7
2
abv
pours
very
clear
bright
yellow
barely
any
foam
bubbles
up
and
that
which
does
fades
away
quickly
without
lacing
this
is
dry
very
thin
bodied
the
predominant
flavor
is
phenolic
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
hot
alcohol
finishes
very
dry
with
some
clove
like
aftertaste
i
suppose
this

after

brand

i
had
to

im
generally
impressed
fairly
average
looking
beer
deepish
golden
color
very
little
head
to
speak
of
a
few
tiny
yeasties
which
i
think
add
to
the
appearance
after
reading
some
other
reviews
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
with
the
smell
but
fortunately
ff
seems
to
have
done
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
typical
belgian
yeast
aromas
fruity
slight
caramel
and
vanilla
not
over
the
top
but
nice
and
subtle
taste
is
also
subtle
though
a
bit
onedimensional
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
and
perhaps
a
bit
thin
fruity
flavors
hints
of
bubble
gum
some
pepper
really
not
bad
at
all
and
rather
refreshing
a
rather
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
this
pours
with
an
unexceptional
white
head
settling
over
a
semihazy
light
goldishyellow
liquid
nose
has
some
funky
smells
to
it
a
little
horse
blanket
a
little
sulphury
too
perhaps
followed
by
a
sweetfruity
malt
aroma
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
sweet
malt
belgiantype
yeast
fruitiness
and
mustiness
a
nice
amount
of
fresh
hops
warming
alcohol
finishes
sweet
at
first
then
drying
due
to
the
hoppiness
then
a
pleasant
alcohol
sensation
well
worth
seeking
out
this
season
fresh
on
draft
2002
only
recently
released
from
the
brewery
by
about
a
week
or
so
i
was
told
by
the
brewery
rep
that
they
had
bumped
it
up
a
little
bit
this
year
deep
golden
slightly
hazy
with
some
tiny
particulate
firm
white
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
initially
leaves
sheets
of
lace
very
nice
the
aroma
is
quite
spicy
from
the
belgian
yeast
strain
no
additional
spices
are
added
with
lots
of
saaz
hops
over
a
vanillatinged
maltiness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
leaving
it
quite
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
wrestling
match
takes
place
between
the
malt
and
the
spice
although
the
spiciness
is
there
continually
and
sometimes
peppery
but
without
any
serious
weight
behind
it
the
almostcookiedough
sweet
malt
does
get
some
good
hits
in
much
more
vibrant
than
the
aged
1
year
bottle
that
i
recently
reviewed
but
the
alcohol
is
also
clearer
and
the
spiciness
is
a
bit
bold
still
fairly
wellbalanced
with
both
the
bitterness
and
spicy
hop
flavor
supporting
the
maltiness
my
guess
is
that
this
is
a
little
more
attenuated
than
last
years
giving
more
alcohol
and
a
slightly
less
full
maltiness
it
finishes
nicely
dry
with
a
long
lingering
fresh
and
spicy
hop
note
still
my
favorite
beer
from
flying
fish
although
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
case
of
bottles
to
cellar
at
least
until
spring
worth
trying
unbelievably

i
highly
recommend
this

is
in

this
is

try

a
sipping
beer
o
this
beer
is
a

maltier
compared

other
beers
but
this
makes
it
very

some
challenges
definitely
a
lot
of
recognizable
qualities
that
ground
it
while
pulling
it
a
little
in
the
direction
of
more
experimental
beers
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
mutated
unibroue
raftman
which
i
love
if
i
had
to
take
a
blind
guess
at
the
style
i
would
have
guessed
a
citrusy

rather
than
a

overall
a
well
made
beer
not
lacking
in
character
i
would
consider
this
a
belgian
imperial
ipa
o
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
definitely
more
american
than
belgian
but
since
i
live
in
and
work
for
the
us

a
i
cant
complain

awesome

the

really
unique
but
kind
of
strange
the
taste
i
find
to
be
much
more
approachable
than
the
aroma
solid
maltiness
w
what
i
believe
is
a
tart
wild
yeast
finish
smooth
especially
considering
abv
bitterness
is
suiting
body
isnt
bone
dry
as
expected
still
a
touch
of
body
left
im
always
down
for
some
real
sour
so
i
find
this
to
be
a
bit
mild
highly
drinkable
beer
quality
unique
and
enjoyable
o
enjoyed
the
brew
would
happily
drink
again
if
someone
offered
me
a
glass
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgium
style
ale
the
american
hop
side
of
the
beer
doesnt
really
compliment
it
well
though
in
my
opinion
worth
my
cellaring
efforts
it
seems
to
have
gently
magnified
the
tartwild
ale
aspects
of
this
brew
which
were
originally
only
of
garnishment
strength
into
minor
subcategory
strength
if
i
were
to
do
it
again
i
would
aim
for
about
22
5
years
of
time
rather
than
3
this
was
a
good
experience
to
be
a
part
of
thank
you
o
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
was
good
to
experience
it
wasnt
my
favorite
but
i
was
happy
to
try
it
nonetheless

cheers
d
i
suspect
this
was
more
interesting
when
it
was
hoppy
and
fresh
as
its
now
its
overly
sweet
with
only
light
funk
and
sourness
i
wish
there
were
actual
bottle
dates
rather
than
batch
codes
but
this
is
nearly
three
years
old
as
far
as
i
can
tell
that
being
said
the
beer
matches
the
description
on
the
bottle
pretty
closely
i
guess
i
just
dont
dig
this
combination
of
flavors
i
labored
through
about
375ml
before
using
the
rest
for
cooking
overall
this
beer
was
the
surprise
of
the
night
the
others
were
expected
to
be
good
but
no
one
knew
anything
about
this
beer
we
were
all
pleasantly
surprised
and
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
quite
good
this
is
one
ive
seen
around
but
just
passed
up
it
was
well
worth
the
try
but
it
doesnt
have
me
eager
to
buy
any
of
the
others
overall
not
something
id
look
for
again
although
i
actually
picked
this
up
because
i
remember
liking
it
a
couple
years
ago
so
much
of
the
bottle
is
yeasty
sediment
that
i
couldnt
drink
the
last
third
of
it
quite
a
shame
d
a
unique
beer
fun
to
try
but
i
feel
no
desire
to
ever
revisit
1
5
orval
on
steroids
and
has
me
feeling
its
charms
notes
with
the
fresh
hops
this
must
have
been
a
different
delight
altogether
in
this
incarnation
it
offers
a
rich
funk
with
a
nice
fruity
sense
it
is
aging
well
decently
drinkable
i
dunno
not
really
blown
away
by
this
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
doesnt
taste
great
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
pours
a
very
murky
golden
color
that
looks
like
unfiltered
apple
juice
with
a
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
very
appleforward
but
not
the
usual
green
apples
this
smells
like
a
big
basket
of
fresh
red
apples
very
unique
smell
a
bit
of
spice
and
funk
as
well
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
red
apple
forward
as
well
a
lot
of
delicious
hoppiness
as
well
with
a
fair
amount
of
booziness
definitely
some
tasty
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
some
great
spiciness
very
sweet
grape
flavors
as
well
the
label
says
this
beer
has
subtle
tartness
but
i
pick
up
zero
tartness
none
whatsoever
which
i
believe
would
have
made
this
beer
outstanding
with
the
great
flavors
im
getting
some
sourness
would
have
been
the
perfect
addition
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
thick
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
fair
d
for
its
strength
extremely
drinkable

of

hint
of
tart

hint
of

slight

slight

fits
the
style

slight

hint

hint

and
hint
of
sweet

overall
good
aroma
and
body
but
lacking
in
appearance
and
mouth
feel
this
beer
has
a
leathery
aftertaste
that
makes
it
hard
to
stopping
licking
my
chops
if
i
see
it
again
i
will
grab
it
well
i
can
say
ive
tried
it
and
didnt
care
for
it
this
beer
seems
hit
and
miss
with
folks
and
it
missed
with
me
d
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
but
i
cant
say
it
was
worth
the
18
i
forked
out
if
you
are
big
into
bitter
hops
you
may
appreciate
this
more
than
i
did
drinkability
only
ok
cant
say
id
recommend
it
nor
will
i
spring
for
another
doesnt
drink
like
most
belgian
strong
pale
ales
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
pour
brings
a
light
caramelcolored
body
with
a
short
for
the
style
white
head
that
doesnt
have
the
best
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
plain
with
some
very
mild
esters
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
too
much
malty
sweetness
and
not
enough
yeast
in
reality
not
much
of
anything
other
than
some
sweetness
this
carries
over
into
the
feel
which
is
almost
cloying
and
isnt
dry
like
id
expect
drinkability
is
decent
enough
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
out
of
this
d
very
high
because
of
nice
clean
flavors
with
some
higher
abv
but
not
too
crazy
drinks
ok
alcohol
can
be
detected
but
only
slightly
lots
of
flavors
are
packed
into
this
beer
some
are
good
some
detract
but
it
makes
this
beer
one
to
sit
back
and
contemplate
which
kind
of
hurts
its
enjoyability
a
worthy
effort
from
tomme
and
de
proef
but
not
amazing
drinkability
is
plenty
fine
the
second
pour
finds
darker
fruit
sugar
notes
more
manifest
possibly
i
should
have
gone
the
snifter
route
on
this
one
to
get
the
dregs
mixed
in
earlier
in
any
case
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
cheers
this
beer
appears
a
very
hazy
light
brown
hue
with
a
minimal
head
and
just
a
touch
of
lacing
aromas
consist
of
belgian
yeast
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
citrus
and
hay
this
collaboration
tastes
decent
but
not
great
for
the
price
and
availability
i
would
never
choose
this
over
duvel
or
delirium
tremens
however
i
am
always
elated
to
taste
a
new
beer
especially
from
two
highly
respectable
breweries
nice
collaboration
here
malts
are
robust
toasty
and
decently
sweet
kind
of
medicinal
with
a
bit
of
bandaid
homebrewy
even
brettomyces
is
barely
discernable
and
that
is
a
big
bummer
despite
the
malts
it
is
a
bit
flat
and
thin
on
the
palate
hop
bitterness
is
still
kickin
pretty
good
lasting
into
the
finish
malts
taste
a
bit
oxidized
and
this
beer
is
obviously
past
its
prime
really
not
very
good
and
a
huge
dissappointment
considering
the
18
price
tag
and
the
fact
it
is
a
deproef
and
t
arthur
collab
i
can
barely
finish
my
half
of
the
750
i
wont
touch
this
one
again
with
a
ten
foot
pole
beer
is
super
thin
and
has
a
bite
to
it
in
the
front
finishes
too
dry
and
overall
is
light
on
flavor
beer
has
an
off
putting
aftertaste
that
is
almost
smokey
i
am
very
annoyed
at
this
point
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
i
would
never
drink
it
again
poured
with
a
decent

with
alcohol
warming

decent
beer
but
nothing

remarkable
poured
a

a
rocky

left
lace

down
the

a
very
potent
aroma
of
honey
corriander
peppery
spices
sugar
tart
fruits
like
berries
some
breadiness
and
yeastiness
are
in
there
as
well
a
fluffy
medium

that
is
slightly
chewey
from
breadi
and
yeastiness
and
also
a
bit
prickly
thanks
to
some
sour
fruittart
fruits
that
cut
and
sour
citric
hops
as
well
as
some
carbonation
an
excellent
balance
thanks
to
spice
and
honeycaramelsweet
malt
that
is
clearly
evident
for
a
mix
of
sour
and
sweetness
and
perfectly
finished
with
a
slightly
tartdry
backbite
that
grabs
the
tongue
abv
wellhidden
and
a
tad
bit
like
a
juicy
white
wine
this
is
a
great
oneoff
pretty
easy
to
knock
this
back
a
little
too
quickly
the
hoppines
and
undetectable
alcohol
make
this
one
a
sneaky
beverage
thanks
to
blake
for
sharing
this
outstanding
beer
delightful
is
a
description
i
dont
often
find
myself
applying
to
a
beer
but
in
this
case
it
is
fitting
lightbodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
tight
merangue
head
peppery
and
pleasantly
sharp
on
the
tongue
orchard
fruit
flavors
flare
in
the
middle
along
with
a
clean
malt
some
white
wine
notes
finish
etoh
is
well
integrated
in
the
flavor
profile
the
body
is
nice
and
full
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
holding
through
to
the
last
sip
a
great
crosscontinental
collaboration
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
fruits
of
more
efforts
like
this
one
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
nice
long
lasting
white
head
nose
is
quite
nice
including
floral
hops
banana
and
sour
apples
taste
is
an
interesting
combination
of
sour
apples
melon
with
a
light
resin
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
drinkability
is
good
a
lot
going
on
and
it
meshes
together
very
well
this
is
one
of
the
funner
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
funk
meets
hops
a
good
experiment
the
beer
pours
a
light
hazy
brown
color
the
aroma
is
light
funk
with
some
yeast
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
funk
apples
other
fruits
and
a
light
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
as
is
the
carbonation
level
d
would
not
seek
out
again
very
well
hidden
abv
along
with
the
great
flavors
and
smooth
body
make
this
an
easy
drinker
the
bold
rich
flavor
of
it
will
keep
you
from
downing
one
every
day
d
de
proef
is
sometimes
a
bit
sheisty
in
my
experience
i
have
had
a
number
of
underwhelming
andor
halfassed
offerings
from
this
brouwerij
this
is
an
underachieving
brew
as
well
the
beer
is
pretty
good
but
it
is
certainly
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
unison
of
two
of
the
foremost
brewers
in
the
game
careful
pour
leaves
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
the
beer
is
a
translucent
yet
clear
honey
amber
color
with
a
persistent
slightly
off
white
head
and
layers
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
deep
and
complex
and
as
it
warms
up
reveals
different
notes
initially
ripe
fruit
and
sweetness
predominantly
apple
and
tangy
citrus
some
light
spice
but
the
finish
is
more
earthy
and
musky
strong
yeast
and
brett
funk
body
is
mediumthick
with
fine
carbonation
the
taste
begins
with
apple
and
honey
sweetness
and
belgian
yeast
in
the
finish
a
fairly
strong
hop
presence
takes
over
and
the
brett
asserts
itself
as
the
sweet
is
balanced
by
an
earthier
dry
flavors
very
nicely
balanced
and
rich
blend
of
complex
flavors
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
is
a
little
boozy
in
the
finish
not
sure
ill
buy
more
at
this
price
but
definitely
worth
the
try
interesting
beer
very
drinkable
and
interesting
glad
to
have
had
it
looked
through
the
cellar
and
decided
to
open
this
one
up
for
new
years
light
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
no
lace
to
speak
of
smell
of
yeast
and
some
spiceyness
and
some
of
the
bret
musty
funk
showing
through
spiceyness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
some
hoppyness
sparks
up
after
the
spice
and
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
overall
an
ok
brew
but
maybe
not
quite
as
kick
ass
as
i
was
hoping
for
new
years
oh
well
back
to
the
cellar
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
cloudy
golden
amberorange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzyfoamy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
and
a
nice
big
island
in
the
center
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
malty
yeast
some
citrus
nice
spice
note
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
yeasty
nice
little
citrus
note
and
some
spices
medium
body
this
one
is
not
hot
as
other
bspa
ive
had
before
very
nice
very
drinkable
a
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
my
allagash
flute
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
golden
color
with
an
orange
hue
there
was
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
o
nit
but
it
didnt
linger
long
and
left
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
the
first
this
that
hits
the
nose
is
some
spiciness
i
get
a
whiff
of
cinnamon
there
is
also
some
breadiness
and
yeastiness
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
apple
in
there
an
interesting
flavor
profile
it
has
some
upfront
bitterness
spicy
with
citrus
notes
medium
bodied
but
lacks
the
normal
belgian
sweetness
very
interesting
and
very
good
this
is
a
subtle
but
complex
belgian
pale
with
a
good
hop
profile
considering
the
age
and
very
drinkable
overall
pours
an
amber
reddish
colour
with
a
mild
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
aroma
is
juniper
citrus
wild
berry
and
molasses
taste
is
the
same
but
with
a
stronger
citrus
taste
espescially
in
terms
of
the
begiining
overall
an
excellent
beer
this
is
a
very
satisfying
rich
brew
a
very
approachable
belgian
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
de
proef
and
tomme
rock
on
personally
i
think
tomme
arthurs
responsible
for
a
lot
of
great
beer
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
collaboration
with
de
proefbrouwerij
honestly
its
exceeded
the
high
expectations
i
had
its
uniqueness
makes
it
special
i
dont
believe
ive
encountered
a
bspa
with
such
a
citrusy
hoppy
presence
i
bet
this
stuff
was
flat
out
incredible
fresh
out
of
the
gate
i
also
like
the
somewhat
mild
effect
of
brett
here
it
works
extremely
well
with
its
other
elements
all
in
all
this
signature
release
is
fantastic
i
wouldve
preferred
a
bit
more
body
but
thats
about
all
i
can
criticize
find
a
bottle
or
two
if
you
can
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
drinkability
was
a
little
better
than
average
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
one
again
but
overall
a
fairly
solid
beer
d
overall
a
good
beer
that
does
not
have
to
many
bells
and
whistles
really
feels
more
like
two
different
beers
battling
for
supremecy
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
lively
on
the
tongue
excellent
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
taste
the
potency
continues
in
the
flavor
in
your
face
sourness
with
a
mild
tang
balanced
by
initial
thick
tacky
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
a
back
of
the
palate
hoppiness
mild
haze
to
this
copper
honey
gold
hued
beer
not
a
great
head
and
no
foam
or
lacing
after
a
minute
or
two
not
much
bubbling
at
all
the
aroma
has
biscuits
and
crackers
with
some
grassy
and
lemony
hops
sweet
and
biiter
inviting
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
crackers
and
brett
yeast
infusion
the
middle
gets
somewhat
fruity
with
the
malt
and
yeast
combo
but
the
hops
give
a
bitter
apple
skin
note
starting
in
the
middle
through
to
the
finish
pretty
complex
flavor
profile
and
pretty
bright
palate
bitter
in
a
flash
but
sugary
sweet
in
just
as
much
time
brett
yeast
and
bitter
american
hops
mixed
in
a
belgian
ale
style
of
beer
drinkability
i
was
surprised
to
read
of
the
brett
in
this
beer
as
it
didnt
have
the
expected
tartsour
character
just
goes
to
show
the
complexity
that
a
little
bit
can
bring
to
a
range
of
other
flavors
that
are
present
in
this
beer
d
surprisingly
drinkable
the
fairly
mild
funk
blends
well
with
the
fruitypine
hop
flavor
and
the
two
become
more
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
finish
and
this
beer
has
the
rare
virtue
of
becoming
sour
without
throwing
away
the
complexity
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
process
certainly
one
of
the
best
nontraditional
sours
i
have
come
across
pours
with
a
huge
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
glue
the
smell
is
like
a
spice
rack
mostly
coriander
i
think
but
there
sure
is
a
lot
of
it
the
taste
is
fantastic
some
hops
and
aa
little
funky
taste
that
is
very
pleasant
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
either
brewery
fantastic
what
a
nice
production
its
a
murky
copper
with
a
thin
layer
of
lace
that
lingers
on
top
of
the
beer
it
has
a
nice
funky
smell
to
it
but
a
lot
of
caramel
notes
are
present
as
well
it
is
sweet
upfront
and
finishes
dry
and
tart
a
very
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
amount
of
body
in
this
beer
as
it
was
not
as
acidic
as
other
brett
beers
also
there
is
a
bit
of
heat
still
on
this
beer
very
nice
to
drink
and
share
with
others
i
like
a
beer
with
brett
that
isnt
dominated
by
bret
poured
into
a
chalice
with
a
massive
billowy
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
hazy
amber
brett
floral
hops
in
the
nosetaste
is
bready
belgian
malt
with
firm
hop
bitterness
and
spiciness
from
the
yeast
nice
brett
flavor
in
the
finish
this
is
how
a
beer
with
brett
should
be
done
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
deproef
beers
but
this
one
was
quite
good
ive
seen
this
one
around
on
the
shelves
for
sometime
finally
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
and
tried
it
d
pretty
good
but
i
dont
find
this
one
to
be
anything
special
there
are
plenty
of
other
good
belgian
ipas
out
there
this
seems
like
a
pretty
decent
belgian
ipa
with
the
bitterness
but
the
dryness
really
leaves
me
feeling
unquenched
and
a
bit
disappointed
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
but
still
this
one
is
bitter
and
dry
a
melange
of
sasion
belgian
ipa
and
heather
beer
interesting
overall
and
a
hop
lovers
dream
but
for
some
reason
the
flavors
seem
seperate
of
each
other
and
this
one
doesnt
really
come
together
very
well
beautiful
burnt
orange
color
ample
lacing
and
mild
carbonation
make
me
excited
to
try
this
experimental
beer
wow
nose
is
much
more
malt
than
i
expected
with
some
citrus
coming
through
orange
peel
likely
a
little
brett
but
mild
taste
is
superb
great
balance
little
detection
of
alcohol
beer
dances
between
bitter
sour
and
sweet
flavors
impressive
to
say
the
least
beer
was
creamy
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
i
tried
not
to
let
the
brewer
duo
impact
my
expectations
highly
recommend
d
i
am
not
sure
750
ml
is
a
lot
and
now
i
kind
of
wish
that
i
was
sharing
this
with
someone
it
is
a
delicious
beer
though
and
so
it
is
at
least
average
in
drinkability
pours
golden
brown
wiith
a
large
head
that
laces
around
the
glass
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
spice
resin
hops
and
some
slight
funk
lemon
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
overdone
and
nicely
carbonated
this
brew
tastes
like
a
hopped
out
belgian
brew
with
some
funk
good
idea
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
to
hoppy
but
there
is
a
distinct
presence
of
resinous
piney
hops
in
the
backbone
of
this
brew
the
brett
presence
is
subtle
but
present
and
the
belgian
yeast
is
there
but
not
too
much
which
can
be
the
downfall
of
so
many
other
belgians
what
is
this
brew
a
belgian
strong
ale
how
bout
a
ipabelgiansour
ok
its
not
that
sour
how
bout
just
a
belgian
ipa
close
but
theres
more
oh
screw
it
its
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
a
damn
good
one
at
that
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
aroma
had
me
expecting
a
lot
so
i
was
slightly
let
down
by
the
taste
belgian
yeast
and
american
hops
dont
really
mix
that
well
to
me
this
one
could
probably
go
under
the
belgian
ipa
category
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
amazing
brew
drinkability
nice
thats
ok
im
now
torn
let
the
second
bottling
beer
i
have
hang
around
or
try
it
now
as
something
of
a
comparison
either
way
itll
be
delicious
im
sure
this
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
wild
belgian
yeast
and
creamy
apricot
hops
with
earthy
caramel
malt
and
sugary
honey
and
a
bit
of
oak
and
alcohol
and
lemon
zest
it
tasted
like
apricot
and
lemon
zest
and
banana
with
sour
belgian
yeast
and
metallic
copper
hops
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
cocoa
powder
and
sugar
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
that
subsided
over
time
and
had
a
lasting
tart
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nicely
done
collaboration
on
a
light
belgian
ale
it
had
a
fairly
delicate
and
complex
flavor
that
was
strong
but
not
overdone
the
alcohol
was
present
but
the
beer
was
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
had
a
mostly
clean
and
enjoyable
taste
with
a
very
nice
smooth
body
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
money
to
try
again
but
it
was
at
least
nice
to
experience
once
pours
a
golden
light
brown
clear
colored
body
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
good
lacing
somewhat
lasting
funky
aroma
some
grains
some
mustiness
not
much
hop
aroma
sweet
and
spicy
smelling
too
spicy
sweet
taste
a
little
drying
almost
a
little
sour
pretty
tasty
refreshing
carbonated
750ml
corked
caged
golden
cloudy
color
with
very
minimal
head
smells
of
roses
old
wood
and
pepper
reminds
me
of
an
old
ladies
tea
room
but
with
8
5
abv
taste
is
dry
caramel
wood
leather
and
pepper
its
a
very
crisp
dry
ale
oddly
enough
it
smells
sweet
but
it
tastes
dry
and
crisp
very
refreshing
in
a
challenging
way
mouthfeel
is
soft
a
little
light
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
just
a
residual
warmth
in
the
throat
the
crisp
finish
makes
you
want
more
and
i
do
d
great
stuff
especially
as
it
warms
its
a
bit
intense
in
some
ways
but
i
think
the
750ml
wont
be
a
chore
to
go
through
although
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
seen
more
hops
and
surely
more
brett
everything
pulled
together
very
well
for
having
so
many
components
this
beer
is
nearly
seamless
i
think
the
complexity
suffers
a
smidge
and
of
course
the
price
sucks
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
interested
in
belgianbelgian
style
beers
d
a
bit
cloying
tough
to
work
through
but
what
i
was
able
to
get
out
of
this
beer
was
solid
others
might
be
able
to
get
through
it
a
bit
more
deftly
and
get
a
better
experience
worth
a
try
pours
a
nice
honey
color
mainly
clear
despite
a
nice
yeast
caked
ring
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
good
sized
bright
white
head
slowly
recedes
and
laces
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
malty
and
honey
sweetness
that
is
complimented
very
nicely
by
some
floral
qualities
and
some
lemon
very
nice
also
some
grass
a
little
pepperiness
some
more
bright
lemons
some
funk
as
well
as
a
good
yeastiness
taste
follows
the
aroma
fairly
well
lemon
and
honey
up
front
some
soft
spices
some
bitter
grassiness
and
pepper
mixes
in
as
well
lemon
carries
through
mixing
with
some
good
yeastiness
bordering
on
just
a
hint
of
tartness
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
refreshing
bitterness
and
pepperiness
on
the
palatea
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
much
like
a
saison
imo
i
was
hoping
it
might
be
a
bit
dryer
but
still
a
decent
amt
of
dryness
mixes
with
the
malts
along
with
the
slightest
hint
of
lemony
tartness
to
make
it
very
pleasing
and
highly
drinkable
very
good
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
sneaky
for
only
8
5
d
its
an
interesting
flavor
but
in
itself
not
mindblowing
especially
at
the
price
for
17
i
expected
more
meh
pours
a
rich
glowing
cedar
with
tints
of
orange
and
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
bready
malts
floral
hops
earthy
spices
citrus
fruits
and
a
subtle
funky
presence
taste
is
equally
complex
i
found
this
to
be
a
superbly
balanced
belgian
ipa
with
a
touch
of
brett
the
funk
does
not
play
a
huge
part
in
the
ale
but
quietly
adds
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
body
is
silky
smooth
with
delicate
carbonation
fantastic
brew
d
nice
solid
beer
the
750
will
be
done
without
any
problem
huge

great

decent

nose

not
really
getting
anything
else
taste
is
smoked
malts
and
slightly
sour
hops
are
there
which
might
be
where
i
get
some
grapefruit
this
would
be
interesting
aged
not
very
complex
as
is
mouthfeel
is
okay
lack
of
tastes
limits
drinkability
for
me
overall
been
in
my
fridge
a
few
months
and
not
really
that
interesting
hops
come
out
as
it
warms
more
but
really
not
one
id
seek
out
might
be
great
with
pork
or
chicken
it
is
going
to
be
all
too
easy
to
finish
this
bottle
im
forcing
myself
to
take
my
time
yet
like
the
best
belgian
strong
pales
it
goes
down
with
astonishing
ease
couple
that
with
the
inherent
complexity
and
you
have
a
worldclass
drinker
can
you
guess
what
i
dont
want
to
do
yeah
share
this
with
someone
is
the
correct
answer
this
bottle
is
mine
all
mine
get
your
grubby
little
hands
off
it
d
being
on
the
east
coast
if
i
get
a
chance
to
grab
onto
anything
from
the
west
coast
that
is
not
distributed
here
then
i
do
can
see
myself
grabbing
more
of
these
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
it
is
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
opens
up
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
it
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
recommended
great
drinkability
for
the
style
definite
sipper
but
very
easy
to
sip
a
while
i
wouldnt
have
thought
possible
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
could
possible
coexist
so
beautifully
yet
they
do
and
it
is
fantiastic
and
i
am
happy
lovely
drinkability
is
super
high
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
forever
a
very
tasty
brew
i
love
belgians
overall
im
happy
i
finally
broke
and
bought
this
beer
the
price
tag
kept
me
away
for
a
while
but
it
was
worth
every
penny
definitely
worth
a
shot
golden
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
aroma
is
belgian
yeasty
spicy
almost
a
little
bit
nutty
flavor
is
yummy
malts
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
tends
to
cleanse
and
dry
the
palate
toward
the
finish
like
hops
do
orange
comes
though
a
bit
later
after
the
finish
yum
creamy
white
fairly
rocky
head
over
clear
orange
body
a
bit
of
honeysuckle
in
the
nose
with
mandarin
orange
with
minimal
spice
on
the
tastebuds
and
a
fairly
clean
though
a
bit
pheolic
finish
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
not
too
assertive
in
either
direction
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
a
nice
advent
to
duvel
etc
definitely
worth
seeking
out
as
is
anything
that
its
namesake
is
affiliated
with
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
having
just
1
glass
of
this
beautiful
beer
is
a
wonderful
experience
its
so
good
i
wish
it
was
at
least
a
semiregular
release
many
thanks
to
messieurs
naudts
and
tomme
arthur
for
the
artmuseumquality
beer
its
superb
wow
i
have
passed
on
this
brew
a
hundred
times
its
quite
expensive
and
i
still
havent
tried
all
of
lost
abbeys
regular
beers
finally
this
was
the
last
one
in
the
fridge
and
i
got
off
my
ass
to
pick
it
up
im
really
glad
that
i
did
overall
this
was
an
intriguing
bspa
that
would
make
an
ideal
aperitif
it
definitely
accomplished
its
mission
of
blending
belgian
tradition
with
american
ingenuity
my
only
gripe
was
the
steep
price
tag

mouthfeel
is
medium
light

a

finish
very
nice
but
quite
pricey
d
aside
from
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
spectacular
beer
well
worth
trying
opinion
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
am
glad
that
i
got
two
bottles
of
this
for
the
record
for
anyone
who
has
read
my
reviews
i
am
not
a
hophead
this
beer
is
hoppy
but
the
balance
is
pretty
amazing
with
the
belgian
components
i
applaud
the
efforts
of
these
two
brewers
and
am
glad
that
i
got
to
experience
this
beer
drinkability
excellent
seek
out
if
you
can
find
for
how
big
it
is
in
mouthfeel
and
how
sweetspicy
it
is
its
quite
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
each
sip
but
i
dont
see
it
as
a
material

quite
drinkable
for
someone
with

somewhat

the

between
the
maltiness
and
the

is
just
great
quite

in

beer
of

really
a

here
goes

slightly
disjointed

the

had
some
sweetness
i
have
to
believe
once
that
balances
out
with
some
bottle
age
this
will
be
an
outstanding
brew
and
at
around
13
not
bad
for
a
special
brew
in
a
750ml
caged
bottle
overall
this
beer
defies

designation
one
of
the
most
unique
and
outstanding
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
you
can
find
it
ignore
the
price
tag
and
just
get
it
it
is
unbelievable
man
this
is
good
tart
fruit
flavors
with
a
thick
sticky
malt
and
resiny
hop
middle
full
of
tropical
fruits
hints
of
stone
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
some
spicey
qaulity
on
the
finish
with
a
nice
spritzy
carbonation
that
really
makes
his
a
drinkable
beer
so
much
going
on
and
just
a
terrific
collaboration
sort
of
a
light
hazy
copper
with
an
average
puffy
offwhite
head
very
subtle
aroma
of
earth
and
yeast
the
flavor
really
did
a
strange
number
on
me
it
was
so
very
mild
and
shy
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
i
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
from
malt
sugar
or
added
sugar
balanced
by
a
faint
bitter
dryness
that
once
again
i
could
not
guess
its
source
hops
yeast
a
very
dry
maltiness
achieved
through
high
attenuation
i
couldnt
say
and
i
couldnt
even
say
if
it
tasted
good
because
everything
was
so
damn
mellow
and
elusive
a
very
coy
beer
it
was
the
soft
medium
body
and
something
again
elusive
on
the
mild
dry
finish
that
made
me
just
go
damn
and
keep
on
taking
rapid
sips
to
hunt
it
down
something
was
happening
but
i
didnt
know
what
this
beer
is
invisible
nothing
bold
or
brash
about
it
you
just
keep
wanting
more
and
then
its
gone
im
still
not
sure
i
get
it
supposedly
a
wild
ale
hopped
like
a
double
ipa
golden
color
with
a
small
wispy
white
foam
smells
of
some
wildness
with
hints
of
florallike
lemony
grapefruity
hops
flavor
has
some
malt
yeast
derived
notes
of
peach
and
nectarine
also
a
lot
of
hop
character
with
some
funkiness
its
a
fairly
good
belgian
ale
the
body
is
more
moderate
but
understandable
with
the
abv
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
light
beer
with
some
very
soft
and
floral
notes
i
should
note
that
this
has
been
aged
just
short
of
a
year
would
like
to
see
this
after
a
few
years
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
belgian
strong
pale
ales
but
this
one
has
a
nice
bit
of
funkiness
and
is
really
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
i
have
more
of
these
that
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
down
the
line
it
should
age
quite
well
d
super
easy
drinking
this
is
a
weird
beer
in
that
it
has
so
much
going
on
almost
too
much
would
love
to
see
how
this
ages
when
that
brett
goes
to
town
a
really
great
singular
beer
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
belgian
or
wild
brews
beware
the
funk
if
you
enjoy
them
you
will
love
this
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
kryptic
poured
a
deep
hazy
golden
color
ale
with
a
huge
bubbly
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
aroma
of
funky
notes
with
some
barnyardlike
notes
as
well
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
barnyardlike
notes
and
some
funky
yeast
with
a
dry
european
hops
finish
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
orval
but
i
would
still
prefer
to
drink
orval
over
this
even
thought
it
is
an
interesting
experiment
d
a
very
nice
treat
on
a
glorious
early
june
sunday
afternoon
paired
at
first
with
some
meats
and
cheeses
then
later
on
its
own
a
likable
ale
which
is
certainly
worth
recommending
tm
mouthfeel
is
perfect
to
me
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
weight
for
this
style
starts
with
some
sweetness
which
fades
into
a
nice
hop
bite
finish
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
comes
through
bnd
turns
into
a
yeasty
and
bready
note
long
dry
finish
brings
thh
alcohol
in
with
an
astringentherbalearthy
note
slight
orangish
tste
comes
in
as
well
with
touches
of
honey
the
750
ml
bomber
holding
the
beer
was
silk
screened
with
a
lot
of
information
about
the
making
of
this
joint
effort
when
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
this
one
looked
decent
but
not
great
the
golden
color
and
the
large
head
were
nice
but
the
chill
haze
was
a
bit
heavy
the
smell
was
quite
a
bit
like
a
saison
with
hops
and
wildness
coming
together
for
an
inviting
bouquet
the
taste
was
a
great
marriage
of
two
bold
and
proud
traditions
the
hops
were
immediately
noticeable
like
they
would
be
in
a
bright
american
ipa
but
the
malt
content
was
quite
a
bit
higher
and
the
unique
dry
and
sour
flavors
that
come
only
from
belgian
yeast
and
brettanomyces
were
vying
for
attention
the
finish
was
spicy
like
white
pepper
the
body
was
medium
thick
and
satisfying
in
its
sticky
consistency
another
proof
that
addition
of
more
hops
is
almost
never
a
bad
thing
drinkability
will
finish
this
bottle
and
report
back
time
passes
even
better
than
i
initially
thought
very
solid
just
not
good
poured
from
corked
caged
750ml
bottle
from
the
ports
bottle
shop
back
in
september
of
last
year
have
tried
many
times
before
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
at
lost
abbey
and
at
the
port
but
never
reviewed
until
now
first
of
all
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
beer
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
even
though
its
a
great
beer
no
matter
the
source
second
with
a
year
age
on
it
the
brett
has
developed
mor
and
some
of
the
hops
have
faded
but
help
balance
it
out
more
like
a
bspa
poured
into
duvel
snifter
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
about
a
finger
thick
with
good
lacing
smell
is
a
light
brett

candi

amd
mellow
citrus
scents
taste
is
sweet
malt
mixed
with
lemon
zest
light
grass
flavors
atouch
of
spice
and
phenolic
compounds
mouthfeel
is
light
body
with
an
active
but
light
carbonation
this
mixed
with
its
great
balance
of
flavors
and
the
fact
that
its
abv
is
well
hidden
make
this
not
only
a
great
drinking
beer
but
a
world
class
effort
by
two
great
brewers
d
this
beer
has
lots
of
crazy
flavors
but
they
all
compliment
each
other
and
none
of
them
are
overpowering
the
beer
store
guy
described
this
as
a
mind
fk
the
flavorings
of
this
belgian
brewery
are
one
of
my
very
favorites
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
is

very
tasty

and
orange
as
well
the
taste
has
similar
components
as
are
reflected
in
the
nose
its
a
seemless
blend
of
piquant
brett
flavor
and
citrusy
hops
interesting
and
delicious
there
is
a
fairly
dry
malt
underlying
everything
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nicely
dry
and
refreshing
sour
funk
insane
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
which
i
appreciate
but
their
strong
presence
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
across
the
board

on

a

less

ultimately
didnt
like
this

as
much
nevertheless
pours
a
murky

with
a
tint
of
orange
massive
foamy
head
lingers
for
a
long
time
sticky
thick
and
foamy
lacing
retains
excellently
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sugars
and
fruity
esters
there
is
an
intense
blend
of
tropical
fruit
the
taste
starts
out
as
predominantly
fruity
the
finish
has
tones
of
orange
and
sugar
like
orange
soda
later
this
finish
becomes
more
dry
and
bitter
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
hops
the
taste
also
becomes
more
complex
a
yeasty
flavor
takes
over
as
well
as
hops
that
balance
the
sweet
tone
as
for
feel
this
is
a
sipper
i
consider
it
a
medium
to
slightly
full
bodied
beer
a
modest
carbonation
but
just
right
for
a
brew

this
complexity

very

clean
and

letting
this
beer
sit
for

behind
the
bar
in
my
basement
very
vinegar
acetic
aroma
touch
of
musty
horse
blanket
with
a
floral
note
flavor
reveals
a
sweet
slightly
toffee
backbone
which
is
surprising
and
a
lightly
lactic
sourness
that
sweet
character
is
really
unexpected
the
finish
is
fairly
bitter
and
dry
when
i
saw
that
this
was
a
flemish
wild
ale
i
expected
some
sour
however
the
fact
that
there
wasnt
much
was
well
offset
by
the
other
very
strong
characters
present
on
my
own
i
dont
identify
profiles
like
barnyard
or
straw
but
those
are
admittedly
exactly
how
this
beer
starts
the
yeast
combo
gives
both
the
banana
and
stone
fruit
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
in
the
finish
overall
a
solid

was
never
completely
lost
to
the
yeast
a
fairly
good
balance
persisted
throughout
its
good
to
know
i
can
buy
this
locally
now
when
i
need
a
medicinal
yeast
fix
i
dont
have
to
rely
on
orval
although
i
do
prefer
orval
to
reinaert
variety
is
the
spice
of
my
life
suffiently
funky
with
dominating
yeasty
breadiness
sour
though
with
a
sweet
and
then
bitter
balance
it
doesnt
quite
win
funky
brew
of
the
year
award
from
me
but
its
still
a
very
good
example
of
a
flemish
wild
ale
funky
yeasty
sour
with
classic
belgian
pale
ale
character
sweetness
and
grassy
hoppiness
an
interesting
brew
crazy
sour
smell
to
it
cherry
and
fruit
can
really
smell
the
yeastiness
great
taste
sour
as
expected
nice
flavor
flavor
and
taste
spread
very
well
throughout
the
mouth
10
750ml
ive
been
pleased
with
previous
de
proef
offerings
so
why
not
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
an
initial
smell
of
acidic
tomatos
that
is
quickly
replaced
some
grassy
alcohol
and
possibly
urine
not
bad
tastes
like
a
wild
tripel
just
a
slight
bit
of
bretty
funk
very
easy
to
drink
not
sour
at
all
sadly
but
it
probably
is
not
supposed
to
be
conclusion
this
is
an
okay
showing
i
think
the
look
and
smell
of
this
brew
is
more
rewarding
than
the
actual
flavor
sure
you
get
a
good
shot
of
brett
yeast
but
there
are
more
complex
and
interesting
offerings
out
there
id
suggest
brewery
ommegangs
ommegeddon
as
a
more
interesting
alternative
to
this

bring

the

i
have
had
literally
about
ten
of
these
in
a
night
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
wild
ales
out
there
highly
recommended
prost
this
beer
is
not
horrible
but
its
not
amazing
or
delightful
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
too
much
carmel
flavor
and
had
a
rough
after
taste
not
likely
that
i
would
search
for
this
beer
ever
again
its
not
a
horrible
beer
ie
didnt
leave
me
with
a
headache
but
i
wasnt
that
into
the
taste
drinkability
im
getting
through
it
perhaps
after
i
get
acquainted
to
the
style
ill
find
this
to
be
a
more
drinkable
example
light
in
body
light
in
carbonation
light
on
funky
flavor
i
guess
that
makes
reinaert
flemish
wild
ale
something
of
a
lightweight
but
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
ok
drinkability
this
is
a
very
daunting
beer
and
show
be
avoided
at
all
costs
by
those
new
to
beer
sour
tart
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
sneaking
in
and
oddly
a
bit
of
creaminess
recommended
for
those
who
want
it
this
review
is
of
the
750ml
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
lovely
orange
brown
color
with
lots
of
visible
pulpy
sediment
locked
in
suspension
carbonation
bubbles
stick
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
before
jetting
to
support
the
hug
frothy
and
lacing
white
head
the
beer
glows
in
the
light
very
nice
alcohol
shows
up
right
away
in
the
nose
slightly
astringent
moderate
funk
some
citrus
and
bready
notes
first
though
while
tasting
is
that
the
beer
was
very
tangy
and
bright
alive
with
carbonation
fresh
hop
and
citrus
fruit
notes
and
a
layer
of
light
but
musky
and
earthy
funk
that
lingers
on
to
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
slightly
coating
very
high
carbonation
i
wish
it
was
more
wild
but
still
worth
a
shot
if
spotted
this
one
was
good
after
about
4
months
of
cellaring
and
with
a
nice
piece
of
grilled
cajun
fish
and
beans
d
pretty
good
it
is
very
musty
an
excellent
beer
for
anyone
to
try
a
must
for
those
who
like
belgians
overall
this
tastes
like
a
raw
and
unpolished
la
fin
du
monde
with
an
interesting
head
however
the
flavor
doesnt
pull
through
for
me
and
while
this
was
interesting
i
do
not
think
i
would
seek
it
out
again
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
little
bit
high
and
makes
this
slightly
difficult
to
drink
a
highlyanticipated
beer
in
this
household
and
it
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
fabulous
stuff
fans

lambicgueze
fans
you
know
what
to
do
hell
youve
probably
done
it
already
md
improves
as
it
warms
always
a
good
thing
i
took
my
sweet
time
and
was
rewarded
almost
two
hours
in
with
some
new
flavors
and
textures
not
a
huge
bitter
bretty
hit
which
can
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
depending
on
what
youre
looking
for
in
the
style
i
give
a
little
more
benefit
to
mouthfeel
than
drinkability
bitey
late
good
unique
drinker
definitly
worth
trying
in
my
book
ill
have
to
put
some
age
on
a
bottle
and
see
what
happens
as
this
could
seemingly
go
a
number
of
ways
was
looking
for
more
funk
from
the
wild
yeast
otherwise
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
last
night
a
new
tripel
different
but
enjoyable
tonight
a
new
masseuse
for
when
my
wildale
knot
needs
rubbing
high
alcohol
but
no
trace
of
it
in
the
flavor
quite
drinkable
d
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
flemish
but
still
tasty
i
would
order
another
one
as
long
as
i
had
a
break
in
the
middle
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
crisp
and
refreshing
tasty
yet
mild
goes
down
very
easisly
with
no
indication
of
the
abv
very
dangerous
if
you
have
to
many
of
these
on
hand
5
it
took
two
separate
tries
to
get
this
to
go
down
it
had
to
breathe
a
little
if
you
can
believe
that
a
nap
might
be
the
best
thing
for
this
cranky
bottle
maybe
one
for
me
too
if
i
had
access
to
de
proefbrouwerij
beer
i
would
be
much
more
likely
to
buy
a
handful
of
these
stubbies
rather
than
the
750
ml
bottles
hopefully
the
brewery
will
pick
the
best
of
the
flemish
primitive
wild
ales
surly
bird
and
pig
nun
and
will
release
them
in
11
2

bottles
if
not
reinaert

is
more
than
capable
of
providing

interesting

the

to
the

the
uninitiated

poorly
quality
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
spicy

the
taste
is
spicy
and
complex
cinnamon
pepper
with
belgian
yeast
hops
and
an
element
of
sweetness
that
makes
itself
known
but
is
quickly
drowned
out
by
a
dry
malty
finish
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side

just
a
little

the
flavor
is
complex
and
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
very
earthy
picking
up
a
little
of
the
floral
to
fruity
flavor
that
i
noted
in
the
smell
longlived
earthy
aftertaste
gives
way
to
mild
hop
bitterness
and
keeps
the
fragrant
flavor
all
the
way
through
medium
to
full
bodied
with
active
carbonation
that
gives
your
tongue
a
little
bite
this
is
a
very
tasty
complex
beer
that
is
perfect
for
sipping
on
the
porch
on
a
rainy
day

paired
with
an
aged

and
a

of

unique
barnyard

the

along
with
a

for
an
interesting
combo
comment
i
enjoy
the
flemish
primitivesa
good
variant
of
the
belgium
strong
pale
ale
a
medium
body
with
some
chalkiness
from
the
residue
and
a
lingering
sweetness
easy
enough
to
drink
but
nothing
real
special
here
d
i
really
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
but
i
only
need
one
a
year
or
so
very
enjoyable
for
that
annual
tradition
however
complex
and
enigmatic
seems
undecided
whether
it
wants
to
be
a
wild
ale
or
a
belgian
pale
ale
bitter
hops
seem
to
get
in
the
way
a
bit
a
pleasant
experience
but
overly
challenging
overall
a
unique
and
pleasant
offering
from
a
brewery
i
havent
had
before
i
really
enjoyed
the
spicydrysour
aspects
of
this
wellbalanced
ale
the
dry
spiciness
lingers
for
a
long
time
which
i
truly
like
lets
me
know
im
into
something
good
ill
definitely
seek
the
others
from
this
brewery
happy
easter
d
as
my
mouth
adjusted
and
the
beer
warmed
it
definitely
grew
on
me
this
beer
is
still
generally
boring
this
made
me
appreciate
the
milder
sourness
of
flanders
reds
and
jps
that
much
more
i
finished
my
bomber
but
ill
not
be
buying
this
again
mouth
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
have
you
believe
and
actually
the
attendance
of
hops
does
not
go
unnoticed
very
highly
carbonated
which
is
great
for
this
style
some
fruity
flavors
but
alcohol
is
all
over
the
place
here
along
the
sides
of
the
tongue
all
the
way
back
through
the
swallow
and
felt
in
the
exhale
as
well
the
brett
is
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
would
have
expected
but
thats
just
the
way
the
beer
is
some
metallic
qualities
that
i
could
do
without

or
drinkability
this
was
an
adventurous
tasting
beer
i
liked
it
it
was
a
very
flavorful
pale
ale
and
easy
to
drink
it
also
cut
the
fattiness
of
the
pizza
really
well
overall
a
decent
brew
but
i
hoped
for
more
from
the
geniuses
at
de
proef
d
for
everything
thats
going
on
here
its
actually
quite
drinkable
not
sure
why
but
im
having
a
tough
time
putting
down
the
glass
high
alcohol
content
is
never
overpowering
and
doesnt
slow
down
the
enjoyment
of
this
belgian
treat
not
one
that
ill
go
back
to
very
soon
but
im
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
unique
beer
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
light
orangegold
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
yeasty
and
earthy
and
a
weird
fruityspicy
smell
too
that
i
cant
describe
the
taste
is
yeasty
fruity
sweetsour
at
the
same
time
its
mainly
apricots
and
a
bit
of
apple
i
taste
but
theres
some
other
fruit
in
there
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
very
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
kicks
in
after
a
few
drinks
of
the
beer
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
really
am
loving
these
wild
ales
quickly
becoming
my
new
favourite
style
the
malt
makes
quite
a
showing
against
the
funk
a
fruity
wildly
yeasty
character
combines
with
with
the
malt
to
create
something
i
cannot
interpret
well
enough
to
describe
i
like
it
though
mouthfeel
is
full
and
foamy
drinkable
to
the
extreme
beer
is
good
happy
downbeat
funky
beering
this
legendery
cunning
fox
of
a
brew
fell
into
my
glass
with
a
dirty
golden
colour
and
sprouted
a
spitty
off
white
coloured
head
it
is
mildly
carbonated
the
nose
is
fruity
and
sour
the
fruitiness
is
one
that
i
am
unable
to
specify
although
white
grape
comes
to
mind
it
has
a
definite
malty
sugar
presence
that
reminds
the
reviewer
of
candy
the
taste
is
quite
satisfying
it
sort
of
reminds
the
reviewer
of
a
white
wine
in
the
finish
i
guess
it
must
be
the
white
grape
impression
leading
me
that
way
it
is
sweet
and
sour
a
bit
of
spiciness
is
noted
the
beer
is
juicy
and
dare
i
say
refreshing
in
a
spritzer
type
fashion
it
has
a
modicum
of
dryness
which
may
be
due
in
large
part
to
alcohol
which
remains
otherwise
undetectable
upon
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
sugary
aspects
make
it
feel
substantial
it
seems
to
coat
my
teeth
as
though
i
were
eating
hard
candies
or
something
the
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
has
a
much
welcomed
flavour
and
it
livens
up
my
night
simply
by
the
alien
nature
of
it
i
am
enjoying
this
and
i
have
no
regrets
in
its
purchase
it
is
a
worthy
milestone
as
a
250th
review
by
myself

overall
wasnt

what
i
was
getting
into
as
a
wild
ale
i
had
major
gueze
visions
or
the
like
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
satisfying
well
worth
a
try
even
if
a
bit
pricey
the
mouth
is
very
dry
and
spritzy
with
some
puckering
towards
the
finish
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
mixed
fruits
and
cheeses
but
it
drinks
very
well
on
its
own
the
abv
does
not
hurt
the
drinkability
drinkability
not
for
everyone
possibly
for
no
one
more
than
wild
just
about
out
of
control
seriously
this
is
slayer
to
orvals
motley
crue
if
you
think
youre
up
to
it
quite
a
challenge
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
one
that
you
should
be
weary
of
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
it
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
dont
quite
know
what
to
make
of
this
one
its
slightly
tart
but
not
what
i
expected
from
a
wild
ale
scent
is
off
a
bit
kinda
funky
but
not
in
a
pleasant
way
at
first
once
the
yeast
settles
a
bit
the
scent
is
easier
on
the
nose
but
it
is
not
indicative
of
the
taste
at
all
taste
is
good
not
great
and
not
very
wild
tart
at
first
this
quickly
fades
to
sweet
then
finishes
a
bit
tart
again
i
barely
taste
the
brettanomyces
perhaps
its
the
saccharomyces
that
is
the
predominant
yeast
here
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
pick
up
if
you
are
looking
for
a
wild
ale
in
particular
look
elsewhere
for
a
wildfermented
belgian
this
is
pretty
good
its
my
first
one
so
im
being
somewhat
conservative
with
my
ratings
because
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
poured
into
a
tulip
yeast
and
all
head
came
in
very
well
for
me
despite
what
others
have
said
tall
white
and
fluffy
leaving
lots
of
lacing
and
it
reformed
after
each
drink
color
was
ciderish
burnt
orange
with
active
carbonation
and
some
floaties
wandering
through
the
glass
nose
was
strong
and
complex
with
fruity
aromas
galore
from
bananas
to
strawberries
followed
by
a
strong
sour
note
taste
hits
the
buds
very
sour
but
in
a
good
way
and
prepares
your
palate
for
a
wave
of
complex
fruity
flavors
yeasty
and
full
this
is
easy
to
drink
at
9
percent
changes
dramatically
as
it
increases
in
temperature
making
each
sip
slightly
different
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
be
on
my
way
tomorrow
to
pick
up
a
few
more
to
see
how
this
one
ages
taste
alcohol
quite
predominant
the
sweet
fruity
aftertaste
mingled
well
with
yeasty
breadcrumb
character
quite
full
bodied
it
was
nice
but
nothing
over
the
top
for
me
a
trend
i
seem
to
notice
often
from
this
brewery
i
didnt
even
knew
deproef
made
the
beer
before
typing
this
a
solid
offering
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
funky
and
fruity
with
some
sourness
lots
of
light
flavors
and
funkiness
with
some
fruits
and
sourness
the
body
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
good
from
notes
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
fell
to
nothing
nose
was
very
nice
sour
and
musty
with
a
light
lemonorange
citrus
very
good
balance
in
the
nose
flavor
was
mellow
and
subdued
light
musty
with
lemon
no
real
sour
character
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
good
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
beer
flavor
was
not
quite
as
intense
in
flavor
as
i
would
like
i
cant
recall
now
whether
or
not
the
bottle
had
yeasted
lees
but
i
sensed
my
serving
was
not
particularly
fresh
still
it
warms
well
and
gives
the
palate
something
to
think
about
the
only
thing
i
wanted
more
from
this
beer
is
head
despite
lively
effervescence
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
fluff
on
top

though
the
thin
coating
that
was
there
was
wellretained
granted
it
could
have
been
a
pouring
error
ill
try
again
later
11
2
oz
short
fat
brown
bottle
fundamentally
sound
appearance
although
this
is
one
of
the
beers
weaker
areas
for
the
style
head
falls
to
islands
with
little
lacing
but
it
indeed
holds
its
own
and
with
each
drink
reproduces
itself
i
found
the
smell
to
be
alot
of
work
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
was
going
on
lots
of
sour
at
first
but
after
a
few
drinks
this
settled
down
and
there
was
a
floweryfruity
backbone
same
thing
with
the
taste
first
drink
seemed
shockingly
abrubdt
but
settles
on
the
palate
from
2nd
drink
on
into
this
magnificent
spicey
clove
and
ohhh
so
smooth
no
alcohol
taste
w
perfect
warming
how
that
is
accomplished
ill
leave
to
de
proefbrouwerij
finishes
dry
this
is
excellent
night
capper
material
and
to
me
it
improves
slightly
when
it
warmed
a
bit
when
the
fruity
flavors
were
revealed
drinkability
should
have
gotten
more
than
one
bottle
while
i
had
the
chance
this
beer
is
excellent
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
as
well
inebrius
you
may
have
under
rated
this
one
thanks
for
the
bottle
now
to
try
and
obtain
it
im
in
for
a
7case
layer
when
liquid
hits
glass
immediate
aromas
begin
to
fill
a
room
like
funky
incense
cones
or
grade
ten
biology
class
a
stew
of
elderly
tree
fruit
cobblestone
paths
alongside
autumn
tannic
rivers
mushroom
sorbet
wet
hockey
bags
and
a
hint
of
lime
leaf
penetrates
your
skull
the
smell
will
have
you
expecting
this
powerful
wallop
of
sour
to
tear
into
your
buds
like
tiny
chainsaws
but
surprise
try
some
fig
jelly
on
a
washed
rind
double
cream
and
wheat
toast
chased
with
olives
provençal
yup
a
retronasal
blast
of
stinky
aged
cheese
escorts
the
tripellike
flavors
all
the
way
through
the
pipes
charged
and
lively
and
hinting
alcohol
only
by
way
of
spice
im
beginning
to
depress
as
my
glass
and
bottle
are
drained
seekers
of
experience
need
more
beer
like
this
wow
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
but
i
found
this
fabulous
and
very
drinkable
will
buy
again
strange
unassertive
brett
character
a
funky
brew
almost
fantomesque
in
its
yeast
taste
nice
tart
coating
flavor
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
pineapple
apples
orange
and
lemon
fizzy
carbonation
a
flavorful
brew
wow
this
is
not
a
good
beer
it
has
the
color
of
a
cloudy
urine
sample
the
smell
is
horribly
sour
the
taste
might
be
better
but
when
you
catch
the
whiff
of
the
smell
it
almost
turned
my
stomach
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
is
no
way
i
would
ever
buy
this
beer
again
interesting
golden
brew
with
some
of
the
notes
of
the
bacterias
that
make
rodenbach
and
the
like
so
complex
but
this
example
is
lacking
something
that
takes
it
beyond
the
curiously
sour
beer
that
it
exists
as
now
sampled
at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting
jul
9th
2004
i
saw
the
word
flemish
on
the
label
and
assumed
flemish
sour
but
after
trying
the
beer
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
fit
in
that
category
very
well
although
i
am
not
wellversed
in
the
style
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
dissipated
quickly
very
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
exactly
like
a
dry
peppery
champagne
lightbodied
and
crisp
with
yeast
pepper
and
yes
a
little
sourness
there
are
also
some
fruit
and
coriander
undertones
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
a
little
vinous
this
is
a
rather
unique
beer
all
in
all
and
i
liked
it
maybe
this
beer
is
wild
and
the
other
one
i
tried
was
amber
the
other
one
said
it
was
wild
so
this
is
good
beer
its
really
like
orval
and
i
will
buy
another
bottle
and
probably
several
more
it
is
an
aperitif
beer
or
an
ultimate
first
beer
you
can
choose
which
way
you
want
to
go
but
this
is
the
real
thing
and
i
suggest
you
buy
some
its
tasty
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
gold
color
topped
by
a
white
head
that
is
held
up
by
a
solid
spritzy
carbonation
the
aroma
is
dusty
musty
grassy
with
hints
of
tropical
fruit
lemony
peach
and
banana
the
smell
is
definitely
quite
complex
the
taste
is
quite
dry
at
first
and
then
the
brett
hits
it
is
like
sucking
on
an
old
shoe
the
unmistakably
leathery
horse
blanket
dominates
the
finish
similar
in
some
respects
to
an
aged
orval
but
with
out
the
hop
presence
there
is
a
bit
of
lemon
up
front
before
the
brett
ignoring
the
brett
funk
this
is
a
nice
light
straight
forward
zippy
belgian
golden
ale
with
the
brett
it
gains
immensely
in
complexity
and
funk
i
happen
to
like
this
but
then
again
i
am
a
lambic
junky
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
copious
fine
carbonation
good
head
retention
aroma
is
light
and
fresh
with
citrus
notes
flavor
has
a
light
fruit
start
with
a
delicate
dry
middle
and
a
tart
finish
a
lingering
tarthoppy
finish
remains
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
a
wellbalanced
brew
except
for
the
lingering
prevalence
of
the
finish
tried
the
amber
ale
and
liked
it
all
right
so
gave
a
chance
to
the
wild
ale
it
comes
from
a
tall
corked
and
caged
750
ml
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
an
archipelago
of
bubbly
formations
across
the
top
of
the
beer
tart
smells
dominate
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
funky
barnyard
smells
its
certainly
reminiscent
of
a
lambic
the
taste
is
something
that
takes
time
to
become
a
friend
its
tartness
and
apparent
lack
of
balance
is
a
bit
offputting
at
first
but
the
flavor
starts
to
make
sense
after
half
a
glass
or
so
the
name
may
come
from
the
wild
yeast
but
wild
describes
the
flavor
well
its
not
refined
or
elegant
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
the
alcohol
is
not
over
the
top
in
the
smell
or
taste
but
this
is
resolutely
not
a
session
beer
750ml
bottle
this
is
a
good
looking
beautiful
yellow
golden
glowing
beer
with
a
thick
bright
white
head
it
let
off
a
powerful
tart
and
honey
scent
once
poured
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
tart
creamy
and
refreshing
warming
the
beer
did
not
really
improve
the
flavors
since
it
was
already
a
tasty
beer
a
good
introduction
to
the
sourness
of
belgian
beers
since
it
is
not
overpowering
and
so
crisp
and
clean
that
the
flavors
rapidly
grow
on
you
not
outstanding
but
a
solid
product
overall
not
a
bad
beer
especially
if
you
like
lambics
this
is
styled
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
the
mix
of
brett
and
spices
in
this
beer
didnt
make
it
one
of
my
favorites
this
cloudy
pale
golden
beer
is
quite
funky
smelling
i
like
that
i
imagine
that
if
you
do
not
like
traditional
lambics
this
beer
will
not
appeal
to
you
because
they
use
two
yeats
strains
that
are
commonly
found
in
lambics
saccharomyces
and
brettanomyces
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
smelling
musty
flowery
and
of
horse
blanket
it
is
smooth
drinking
with
a
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
apples
and
honey
it
finishes
dry
with
some
spiciness
probably
from
the
high
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
sourness
that
could
just
be
an
effect
from
the
dry
finish
light
murky
blonde
with
a
garden
smell
hay
funk
appletart
taste
confirms
the
bottles
brett
promises
dry
like
hell
with
salt
hints
medium
bodied
fresh
eminently
refreshing
delicious
brew
a
poet
that
no
one
understands
piece
of
art
cheers
john
the
smell
was
odd
to
say
the
least
wild
is
a
misnomer
in
1991
as
a
20
year
old
college
student
i
went
to
the
kentucky
derby
spent
10
long
hours
in
the
infield
of
churchill
downs
met
several
future
exwives
never
saw
a
horse
and
woke
up
in
the
parking
lot
the
next
morning
shoeless
with
a
smell
of
stale
beer
fresh
cut
grass
horse
urine
and
wet
dog
overcoming
me
this
beer
smelled
exactly
like
that
may
morning
12
years
ago
ugghhh
wild
vulgar
and
nasty
all
at
once
unbelievable
odd
tasting
tart
spritzy
bubbly
sweet
champagne
like
taste
i
thought
this
would
be
like
a
spicy
belgian
dubbel
instead
its
the
bastard
son
of
a
sun
skunked
duvel
and
andre
brut
champagne
sweetness
fades
dryness
in
the
body
then
a
chalky
metallic
lingering
finish
sour
puckering
aftertaste
i
drank
it
all
and
seriously
regret
it
highly
charged
bubbly
carbonation
but
very
hard
to
drink
sorry
bum
i
couldnt
get
into
this
one
medium
gold
color
cloudy
large
foamy
head
aroma
is
tart
and
sour
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
a
medium
bodied
ale
it
not
very
sour
for
a
flemish
sour
ale
yeasts
are
fairly
bright
yet
the
malts
arent
very
sweet
and
fruity
as
i
was
expecting
ok
so
it
neither
sweet
enough
nor
sour
enough
yet
it
an
interesting
beer
it
does
balance
what
sweet
and
sour
characteristics
are
available
and
the
wild
yeast
flavors
are
interesting
it
also
a
very
refreshing
beer
hides
the
9
0
alcohol
very
well
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
overall
quite
strange
a
mix
between
a
blonde
and
a
tripel
with
some
lambic
duvelian
character
the
triplefermentation
with
two
yeasts
makes
for
a
tasty
unique
style
beer
the
feint
of
heart
may
not
take
to
it
well
worth
a
try
comments

this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
i
was
disheartened
to
see
only
four
other
reviews
id
like
to
see
what
other
experienced
bas
have
to
say
about
this
one
very
hazy
yelloworange
with
dense
offwhite
head
that
held
heavy
yeast
and
citrus
on
the
nose
some
mustiness
spicy
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
carbonation
stings
the
tongue
distinctive
yeasty
citrus
across
the
tongue
and
it
somehow
becomes
slightly
sweet
at
the
back
of
the
throat
feels
thick
and
very
drinkable
for
a
9
trying
to
think
of
a
food
that
will
go
well
with
this
and
somehow
a
lemmondill
cream
sauce
over
salmon
comes
up
but
im
not
normal
pours
a
hazed
pale
yellow
with
a
massive
fluffy
white
long
lasting
head
the
smell
consists
of
a
musty
yeast
smell
with
a
light
fruity
background
that
isnt
bad
but
quite
different
in
an
odd
way
this
is
one
beer
that
is
out
there
in
its
execution
of
a
beer
i
taste
again
the
musty
yeast
with
cinnamon
spicing
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
but
is
extremely
interesting
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
and
it
finishes
uhsweetuhdry
there
is
not
anything
smooth
about
this
beer
and
i
dont
believe
it
is
what
the
brewers
intended
either
it
is
bold
in
its
own
unique
way
not
with
hops
not
with
an
overwhelming
alcohol
taste
but
with
a
bouncing
transition
of
flavors
whoah
im
labeling
this
a
must
try
not
that
its
great
but
that
its
oh
so
interesting
thanks

the
beer
pours
a
blurry
lemon
yellow
color
the
head
is
substantial
in
size
creamy
in
consistency
bright
white
in
color
and
as
it
dissolves
and
a
thick
and
glutinous
sheet
of
lace
is
left
behind
to
seal
off
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
medicinal
sweet
malt
citrus
like
with
the
start
sweet
and
loaded
with
malt
top
is
middling
in
feel
finish
is
tart
as
in
lemon
like
the
acidity
cautious
the
hops
spicy
in
their
bite
and
the
herbal
like
tones
are
quite
evident
quite
dry
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
after
the
beer
is
long
gone
this
one
is
a
fun
strong
golden
that
fermented
with
some
wild
brettanomyces
the
brett
is
not
over
done
it
does
provide
a
low
level
earthiness
to
it
which
adds
some
complexity
malty
up
front
with
some
wild
yeastiness
to
it
rather
low
fruity
ester
for
a
belgian
but
the
finish
dry
and
hoppy
pungent
aromas
of
rubbing
alcohol
slightly
masked
by
decreasingly
subtle
phenolic
aromas
the
beer
is
nice
and
sweet
up
front
very
lively
with
a
brief
flash
of
oak
wood
rotten
vegetables
and
gently
creeping
bitterness
its
a
tasty
beer
for
sure
and
fairly
unique
though
it
ressembles
duvel
and
similar
beers
a
fair
amount
the
slightly
off
flavor
at
the
end
gives
this
beer
its
character
unpleasantly
sour
aftertaste
beyond
just
the
belgian
style
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
in
general
but
some
of
the
original
styles
from
belgium
have
surprised
me
this
is
not
one
of
those
though
sometimes
american
brewers
can
do
magical
things
with
belgian
styles
and
other
fall
short
this
one
to
me
falls
on
the
short
side
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
one
i
would
go
after
again
when
there
are
so
many
amazing
offerings
out
there
these
days
average
thats
a
3
in
my
book
not
a
3
75
sorry
i
freely
admit
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
belgian
yeast
strains
but
this
one
suited
me
just
fine
one
two
three
four
five
true
to
what
the
style
is
yet
lacking
any
huge
oommpphh
that
nebco
is
known
for
good
but
not
seekable
wasnt
what
i
expected
but
i
like
it
nice
beer
light
body
with
adequate
carbonation
smells
of
honey
pear
clove
and
light
perfumed
warmth
nothing
overpowering
but
pleasant
enough
in
the
nose
i
like
this
but
it
is
dangerously
close
to
being
too
sweet
for
my
taste
it
reminds
of
the
time
i
fried
pears
in
way
too
much
honey
that
was
sticky
sweet
and
this
beer
is
almost
there
huge
honey
notes
with
light
pear
and
flowery
heat
blanketing
everything
there
is
a
lingering
clove
flavor
that
helps
cut
the
sweetness
somewhat
great
name
on
packaging
for
a
pretty
good
beer
very
smooth
for
a
9
this
is
a
good
beer
but
ill
take
a
duvel
or
matilda
anyway
o
worth
picking
up
if
you
visit
the
constitution
state
humerous
artwork
on
the
cans
will
entertain
party
guests
too
o
smooth
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
classic
pale
belgian
flavors
some
very
pale
malt
a
good
dollop
of
hop
bitterness
the
aforementioned
yeast
and
a
solid
alcohol
warmth
particularly
in
the
swallow
wellbalanced
the
body
is
as
i
would
expect
the
carbonation
slightly
above
average
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
im
not
particularly
fond
of
the
yeast
profile
but
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
smooth

12
oz
cans
o
a
very
good
pale
belgian
not
my
first
choice
in
style
but
i
do
like
this
very
much
its
also
much
better
than
a
certain
other
maidennodding
beer
that
shall
remain
nameless
at
9
this
beer
drinks
exceptionally
well
with
that
drying
and
bitterness
masking
that
alcohol
very
well
o
very
strong
and
tasty
beer
dangerously
drinkable
but
boy
is
it
enjoyable
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
in
belgianstyle
beers
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
this
is
a
great
starter
for
those
first
exploring
the
style
its
also
very
enjoyable
on
its
own
merits
o
no
shortage
of
taste
in
this
brew
the
belgian
yeasty
ripe
fruit
flavor
is
pretty
strong
making
it
an
agressive
representative
of
the
style
american
made
belgian
beers
are
usually
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
is
definitely
a
hit
and
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
nebco
at
this
point
first
this
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
citrus
and
the
funky
belgian
yeast
clearly
apparent
the
taste
definitely
has
that
distinctive
belgian
yeast
flavor
but
its
not
overdone
at
all
which
i
feel
is
the
problem
with
american
belgians
too
much
spicecloveetc
this
beer
definitely
got
a
good
addition
of
hops
with
juicy
grapefruit
coming
through
but
it
stops
just
short
of
any
bitterness
and
instead
mellows
out
into
a
smooth
almost
creamy
feel
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
its
a
good
thing
i
didnt
try
to
guess
its
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
and
its
definitely
worth
buying
again
90100
o
very
good
light
belgian
style
ale
if
i
lived
in
connecticut
id
drink
it
quite
a
bit
o
awesome
name
awesome
can
and
tasty
beer
lots
of
belgian
yeast
flavors
swirling
around
fruits
spice
and
sugar
very
well
crafted
o
definitely
something
i
will
come
back
to
again
in
the
future
decent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
good
mouth
complexity
though
i
found
it
too
sweet
with
lower
drinkability
but
if
you
like
the
style
it
is
a
good
option
yep
and
the
name
is
pretty
damn
good
too
o
this
is
good
just
a
little
sweet
for
my
preference
o
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
only
drawback
is
that
you
get
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
of
course
you
should
know
i
live
in
delaware
and
in
close
proximity
to
dogfish
head
and
have
a
very
intimate
look
for
hops
when
sampling
i
assume
it
is
similar
to
that
ability
of
people
that
can
taste
even
the
slightest
influence
of
oak
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
full
head
developed
white
and
frothy
to
creamy
with
great
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
cloudy
with
a
golden
honey
color
aroma
was
citrus
and
yeast
with
some
spice
and
grass
notes
tasted
grainy
and
yeasty
with
floral
herbal
and
citrus
notes
nice
medium
to
full
mouth
feel
with
a
sweet
and
lingering
aftertaste
a
pretty
spot
on
example
of
the
style
this
beer
out
of
a
wine
barrel
is
probably
something
to
behold
can
share
at
proof
courtesy
of
masterson
head
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
about
half
an
inch
of
head
just
in
a
rocks
glass
head
lasted
extremely
well
great
lacing
thick
white
collar
once
the
head
did
fade
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
some
clean
earthy
hops
taste
is
similar
with
a
touch
of
funk
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
very
enjoyable
as
a
connecticut
resident
i
love
new
england
brewery
its
close
by
and
i
love
to
bring
friends
by
to
see
the
small
but
ambitious
location
the
color
is
golden
with
a
great
foam
its
refreshing
yet
still
has
ample
body
to
be
drank
alone
the
hints
of
citrus
on
the
end
balance
well
with
the
wheaty
taste
in
the
beginning
we
paired
it
with
light
italian
and
were
very
happy
with
how
well
the
beer
paired
the
price
point
on
a
four
pack
is
pretty
fair
and
the
availability
in
stores
inside
ct
is
very
nice
everyone
we
turn
on
to
this
beer
keeps
coming
back
for
more
while
some
beers
tend
to
give
either
a
love
or
hate
reaction
this
one
is
almost
guaranteed
to
appease
almost
anyones
palate
on
a
side
note
absolutely
love
the
name
and
the
artwork
on
the
side
of
the
can
overall
one
of
my
favorites
in
category
and
from
nebco
easily
a
must
buy
again
o
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
great
representation
great
flavor
and
aroma
and
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
want
to
kill
one
of
the
few
belgian
ales
i
like
by
drinking
it
too
often
as
they
arent
among
my
favorite
styles
but
i
will
certainly
grab
a
few
cans
of
this
stuff
every
so
often
from
now
on
tastes
like
better
than
average
homebrew
overall
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
based
on
their
dipaipa
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
brewer
it
needs
more
carbonation
and
little
more
complexity
taste
wise
the
body
was
also
average
smooth
and
even
but
again
the
alcohol
hung
around
a
bit
too
much
except
for
the
alcohol
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
went
down
easily
and
i
could
have
had
a
couple
with
no
complaints
overall
a
pretty
typical
example
of
the
style
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
if
it
were
3abv
it
would
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
but
since
its
9
its
more
of
a
sipper
that
takes
you
by
surprise
pours
a
toasted
almond
meat
hazed
ale
with
a
ring
of
soapy
whites
with
some
etched
surface
smells
like
apricot
white
grapes
cracker
some
nice
sweet
citrusy
juice
real
awesome
nose
flavor
follows
through
with
a
good
fruity
character
some
more
apricot
pineapple
apple
juice
some
grain
some
nice
refined
and
mature
belgian
yeast
with
a
clay
character
medium
on
full
bodied
with
moderately
hi
carb
and
a
nice
wet
finish
fucking
a
real
delicious
if
i
could
score
this
in
the
pnw
id
slam
it
while
camping
for
sure
o
this
was
a
decent
strong
belgian
style
ale
however
there
are
plenty
of
others
that
i
would
prefer
drinking
this
to
it
was
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
july
day
but
it
definitely
wasnt
anything
that
blew
my
mind
away
if
you
like
the
style
id
definitely
recommend
trying
it
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
poured
from
a
can
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
very
good
lacing
down
the
glass
went
down
rather
easily
for
a
belgian
strong
almost
too
easy
good
buttery
mouthfeel
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spiciness
wish
that
i
was
able
to
get
this
more
often
but
then
again
i
might
be
in
trouble
if
that
was
the
case
simply
fantastic
a
definite
must
try
if
you
havent
yet
o
this
reminds
me
of
a
modern
duvel
the
aroma
is
almost
identical
just
a
little
less
sharp
absolutely
tastes
like
something
that
should
come
from
a
dusty
trappist
bottle
not
a
can
from
connecticut
taste
holds
the
noses
line
to
start
a
little
pick
of
alcohol
in
the
middle
smooth
sailing
through
the
spicy
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
drinkability
is
almost
too
easy
like
this
one
muchly
and
in
a
can
to
boot
sold
o
the
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
9
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
i
was
shocked
to
notice
that
it
had
that
high
of
an
abv
there
are
some
good
flavors
in
this
beer
and
it
is
likely
the
best
belgian
style
beer
that
i
have
had
in
a
can
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
amber
color
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
light
reddish
or
orange
tint
to
it
the
beer
had
a
dense
creamy
off
white
head
that
we
well
retained
the
beer
gave
off
a
moderate
aroma
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
defiantly
belgian
but
it
also
had
this
slight
cherry
taste
to
it
which
i
thought
was
very
interesting
the
beer
had
a
heavier
feel
to
it
but
it
was
smooth
creamy
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
i
would
probably
not
drink
too
many
in
one
sitting
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
try
again
when
i
see
it
cloudy
burnt
orange
pour
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
retained
well
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
taking
a
whiff
i
believe
my
comment
was
very
belgian
indeed
fruity
esters
in
the
nose
belgian
yeast
coriander
similar
taste
pear
banana
stone
fruit
citrus
yeast
coriander
doughy
malts
lending
some
sugary
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
a
little
chewy
pretty
good
overall
not
something
im
always
in
the
mood
for
but
id
get
this
again
decent
belgian
strong
ale
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
9
abv
though
tasty
and
unique
although
some
of
the
hop
and
spice
combinations
are
a
little
less
than
desirable
for
my
taste
buds
still
a
good
beer
recommended
to
fans
of
belgianstyle
strong
ales
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
appearance
wasnt
as
clear
the
head
wasnt
as
everlasting
the
aroma
and
taste
werent
as
complex
and
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
creamy
as
some
of
the
better
belgian
examples
but
it
was
tasty
nonetheless
furthermore
it
was
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
9
abv
maybe
the
best
part
was
that
it
was
in
a
can
i
never
thought
i
would
see
a
belgianstyle
ale
in
a
can
thanks
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
one
jared
one
of
the
better
belgian
pale
ales
made
in
the
us
love
it
o
668
is
a
solid
bspa
nebco
continues
to
show
their
prowess
and
im
glad
that
this
is
becoming
more
readily
available
throughout
ct
definitely
worth
a
try
a
really
good
belgian
pale
i
love
the
yeast
flavors
in
this
one
it
pours
a
just
hazy
bright
yellow
color
spirited
head
of
two
inches
or
more
and
bone
white
rests
on
top
there
are
a
few
little
yeasties
floating
around
as
well
the
packaging
on
this
beer
should
also
be
mentioned
what
a
clever
can
and
beer
name
genius
at
work
the
nose
is
belgian
yeasty
with
some
spice
and
some
lemon
rind
and
the
malt
profile
sis
rather
simple
im
shocked
to
learn
the
abv
is
9
because
i
cant
smell
or
taste
it
but
i
can
definitely
feel
it
after
a
quick
can
some
mild
vanilla
in
there
with
the
creamy
lemon
flavor
and
a
bolder
medium
body
to
make
it
stick
some
grassy
herbal
notes
in
the
finish
part
hops
part
hay
very
summery
all
in
all
excellent
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
for
a
beer
this
big
a
definite
sneaker
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
new
england
brewing
courtesy
of
a
fantastic
trade
with
thebrewo
a
great
many
thanks
for
the
sampling
of
stuff
from
these
guys
ive
really
enjoyed
all
of
it
so
far
a
beer
that
ive
been
wanting
for
a
long
time
mainly
due
to
the
cans
artwork
and
the
funny
name
been
a
die
hard
maiden
fan
for
a
long
time
and
this
is
just
hilarious
the
beer
being
great
is
an
excellent
plus
overall
4
25
color
me
impressed
not
necessarily
a
standout
according
to
the
style
guidelines
but
ill
be
damned
if
this
isnt
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
to
drink
and
as
mentioned
in
the
tasting
notes
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
well
the
phenols
really
work
into
this
beer
great
fruit
and
spice
tones
nice
and
yeasty
and
rich
but
still
dry
great
beer
and
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
overall
excellently
nuanced
subtle
but
very
flavorful
ill
miss
this
since
nebco
is
leaving
ma
for
now
o
average
belgian
nothing
too
special
nice
to
see
the
style
in
a
can
though
o
good
not
great
beer
i
would
probably
not
choose
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
sticky
white
head
the
nose
presents
a
bouquet
of
boozeinfused
honey
floral
hops
and
fruity
yeast
esters
it
definitely
establishes
that
its
a
bspa
in
the
nose
the
taste
works
in
a
complex
melange
of
yeast
fruits
honey
sweetness
and
grains
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
semidry
white
grape
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
approachable
and
drinkable
for
being
a
9
beast
and
leaves
a
lot
of
traditional
elements
present
compared
to
a
duvel
for
instance
im
excited
for
such
a
delicious
canned
beer
available
in
wnycny
and
recommend
a
brief
warming
period
followed
by
some
smooth
jazz
and
reasonably
paced
sippage
cheers
very
smooth
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
o
this
is
a
very
nice
solid
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
thanks
davey
101
for
sending
me
this
beer
overall
i
must
judge
on
the
style
but
i
hate
this
style
i
received
this
as
a
poker
payout
so
i
cant
complain
for
free
beer
but
this
is
just
like
every
other
shitty
dank
musty
and
milldew
tasting
belgian
i
really
want
to
thank
poorpatz
for
the
chance
i
enjoyed
the
chance
but
wont
seek
this
out
again
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
some
hop
resin
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
o
a
delicious
and
tasty
bspa
lots
of
spicy
black
pepper
on
the
back
end
so
i
hope
you
like
that
in
your
beer
great
combination
of
strong
fruitiness
yeastiness
and
spiciness
md
smooth
and
drinkable
slightly
effervescent
a
great
beer
is
the
house
at
670
for
sale
o
a
solid
bspa
overall
its
a
little
lacking
in
depth
and
needs
to
be
more
carbonated
but
still
is
enjoyable
spicy
peppery
hop
bitterness
up
front
candyish
malts
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
swell
filling
the
palate
the
slightly
boozy
fruity
sweetness
lingers
as
the
herbal
peppery
hop
bitterness
rules
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
sparkling
lively
feel
delicious
and
devilish
one
of
the
better
american
duvel
ales
pretty
good
not
as
satanic
as
the
label
would
suggest
recommend
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
some
hop
resin
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
o
sweet
but
not
overly
with
some
bubblegum
like
flavors
that
are
very
welcoming
it
has
great
balance
with
respect
to
bitterness
to
sweetness
the
yeast
is
strong
and
brings
out
great
belgian
style
flavors
this
is
just
overall
a
great
beer
o
really
like
this
and
im
not
usually
into
the
high
abv
belgians
tons
of
different
flavor
notes
weaved
together
beautifully
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
highly
reccomended
one
of
the
best
us
belgian
style
brews
ive
had
o
for
a
nine
percent
alcohol
beer
the
booze
is
really
well
hidden
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
deffinatly
give
this
a
whirl
of
you
have
the
chance
o
i
really
love
the
name
of
the
beer
as
well
as
how
it
looks
smells
and
feels
but
i
didnt
like
the
taste
of
it
pours
golden
blonde
with
a
small
white
head
its
a
touch
hazy
not
the
prettiest
belgian
out
there
but
perfectly
acceptable
the
aroma
is
raisins
limes
and
sugary
malt
theres
also
a
light
tropical
fruit
note
and
some
peppercorncoriander
spice
taste
is
drier
than
expected
its
mostly
sweet
malt
and
spices
upfront
but
the
finish
is
dry
with
more
of
that
lime
rind
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
for
a
9
abv
beer
im
pretty
surprised
at
the
strength
theres
very
little
booze
or
stickiness
this
beer
isnt
going
to
blow
anyone
away
but
its
a
very
nice
belgian
and
the
can
is
a
fun
bonus
o
definitely
enjoyed
this
hard
to
believe
that
is
9
seems
more
like
a
6
as
you
drink
it
also
it
is
local
for
me
which
is
a
plus
and
i
love
the
name
o
a
pretty
good
beer
drinks
rather
easy
for
9
would
drink
again
for
sure
the
only
issue
with
labeling
this
beer
the
neighbor
of
the
beast
is
that
it
makes
me
want
the
real
beast
and
this
is
not
as
good
as
duvel
while
the
belgian
yeast
strain
here
is
rather
aggressive
it
somehow
lacks
the
depth
of
others
in
this
style
its
tasty
but
not
amazing
o
a
little
sweeter
than
i
want
in
a
bspa
but
still
quite
tasty
i
would
take
duvel
over
this
but
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
but
welldisguised
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
stronger
belgianstyle
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
o
good
beer
havent
had
much
from
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
could
myself
purchasing
this
from
time
to
time
if
it
was
available
to
me
o
a
very
tasty
golden
ale
for
a
nottoobad
price
point
glad
to
have
two
4packs
of
this
recommended
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
style
pale
ale
that
has
just
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
maybe
if
i
get
out
east
ill
get
to
try
some
more
offerings
from
new
england
brewing
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
it
gets
sort
of
heavy
and
cloying
after
a
while
i
dont
find
myself
wanting
a
second
that
said
its
remarkably
drinkable
for
the
abv
overall
im
not
a
huge
belgian
yeast
fan
but
this
is
well
balanced
and
manages
to
be
massively
belgian
without
being
overbearing
nice
depth
of
flavor
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
could
use
better
mouthfeel
and
some
more
head
those
considered
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
all
said
and
done
im
quite
impressed
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
is
very
balanced
smooth
and
welldone
if
this
were
available
on
a
regular
basis
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
own
fridge
great
job
guys
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
nice
cloudy
head
that
never
leaves
aromas
of
grains
spices
and
subtle
hops
hit
the
nose
not
a
very
strong
smelling
beer
but
nice
somewhat
sweet
on
the
nose
taste
is
full
of
sugar
with
plenty
of
fruits
bread
doughs
and
hop
backbone
round
out
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
dry
but
thin
overall
this
is
a
sessionable
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
nice
o
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
belgians
but
this
was
a
pretty
great
brew
borders
on
the
belgianamerican
line
nebc
is
new
to
me
but
im
impressed
so
far
havent
had
anything
less
than
great
yet
poured
from
a
really
cool
can
into
a
snifter
nice
golden
color
with
a
light
white
head
the
smell
is
dead
on
for
the
style
taste
is
everything
ii
expected
from
the
smell
spice
sweetness
delicious
one
of
the
best
american
belgian
style
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
cant
believe
this
is
9
abv
the
alcohol
his
hidden
really
well
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
and
i
am
very
pleased
hope
to
snag
some
more
in
the
future
o
solid
saison
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
o
very
good
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
o
great
overall
taste
aroma
and
appearance
the
alcohol
is
hidden
incredibly
well
im
a
big
fan
of
new
england
brewing
and
this
the
newest
beer
ive
tried
from
them
only
reaffirms
my
love
for
the
brewery
well
done
668
notb
pours
a
crystal
clear
tangerine
with
some
goldenrod
highlights
the
pour
is
abysmal
theres
barely
a
finger
of
white
foam
and
it
disappears
quickly
and
cleanly
the
appearance
score
would
be
lower
if
not
for
the
fact
that
i
didnt
have
this
problem
with
some
of
my
other
668
cans
the
nose
is
a
nice
blend
of
pear
heavy
fruits
and
pepper
and
clove
phenols
the
two
are
pretty
evenly
balanced
though
overall
the
aroma
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
more
attention
grabbing
the
flavor
profile
is
top
notch
some
green
apples
creep
in
to
join
the
the
pears
at
the
open
and
the
spicy
phenols
still
have
plenty
of
zip
theres
also
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
from
a
slight
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
stops
just
a
step
short
of
being
great
its
unquestionably
got
a
dry
body
and
bubbly
level
of
carbonation
each
could
stand
to
be
taken
even
a
little
bit
farther
i
really
like
neighbor
of
the
beast
its
one
of
the
american
brewed
belgians
ive
liked
the
most
in
recent
memory
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
offering
from
the
new
england
brewery
although
this
didnt
blow
me
away
completely
it
was
definitely
enough
to
keep
my
interested
in
it
its
al
all
around
good
belgian
style
beer
which
is
made
in
america
something
sort
of
hard
to
find
at
the
very
least
i
could
easily
say
that
this
is
the
best
belgian
style
beer
ive
drank
in
a
can
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
some
banana
taste
to
it
some
wheatyness
yeast
its
quite
sweet
this
is
a
solid
belgian
ipa
and
im
not
usually
in
love
with
these
mild
almost
cedarish
taste
to
it
o
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
thanks
cliffbrake
for
the
surprise
while
its
deff
malty
you
do
taste
the
belgian
yeasts
and
hops
slight
citrus
and
straw
notes
the
alcohol
is
present
a
bit
noticeable
but
nicely
compliments
the
flavor
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
well
worth
the
money
paid
for
the
4pack
and
would
buy
again
however
the
main
reason
i
even
went
out
to
new
haven
was
for
gandhi
bot
and
i
wouldnt
make
a
special
trip
for
this
brew
but
i
would
deff
pick
up
again
while
buying
gbot
some
nice
symmetry
review
of
668
is
my
668th
beer
review
m
the
feel
was
also
wonderful
nice
and
light
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
it
never
got
flat
or
boring
and
offered
a
very
nice
sessionable
feel
to
it
crisp
and
clean
this
went
down
easily
and
really
was
just
a
pleasant
expierence
all
around
odi
only
bought
one
can
seeing
as
a
4pack
is
13
one
is
enough
as
this
is
overpriced
but
i
love
nebco
this
one
is
pretty
good
definitely
a
step
or
two
below
gandhi
bot
and
imperial
stout
trooper
but
this
is
damn
tasty
in
its
own
regard
i
think
this
is
the
first
belgian
style
ale
ive
ever
had
from
a
can
and
it
is
damn
good
i
love
the
amount
of
spicing
here
and
even
though
its
the
dominate
profile
its
not
heavy
handed
at
all
great
balance
and
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
9
beer
very
well
done
served
on
tap
at
delaneys
nice
orangegold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
fruity
nose
with
a
strong
yeast
presence
taste
was
sweet
a
little
spicy
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
i
caught
a
hint
of
coriander
and
pepper
as
well
hides
its
9
very
well
i
only
caught
a
big
of
an
alcohol
flavor
very
tasty
local
belgian
a
murky
yellow
with
white
head
a
clove
banana
aroma
similar
tastes
prevail
with
an
odd
apricotfruit
undertone
as
well
as
some
yeasty
funk
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sticky
overall
a
good
belgain
especially
for
a
style
i
dont
usually
like
thanks
again
gcurlow
overall
rather
nice
and
in
a
can
to
boot
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
candi
sugar
and
a
bit
less
pith
but
that
is
a
nit
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
then
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
was
a
bit
much
i
enjoyed
my
can
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
another
great
addition
to
the
other
nice
can
offerings
from
nebc
its
hitting
the
spot
perfectly
thanks
go
out
to
chris
who
hooked
this
one
up
low
overall
score
due
to
lack
of
dating
the
hotness
of
the
booze
here
does
detract
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
fairly
average
for
style
perhaps
not
even
average
due
to
the
lack
of
spiciness
and
the
booze
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
well
hidden
click
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
especially
for
a
9
into
an
oversize
wine
glass
this
pours
a
hazy
glowing
dirty
yellow
gold
under
a
well
retained
creamy
head
with
a
brilliant
display
of
carbon
bubbles
swimming
to
the
surface
aroma
is
clearly
highlighted
by
belgian
yeast
and
pungent
fruity
ester
perhaps
most
akin
to
earthy
orange
rind
juicy
bittering
fruit
is
king
here
filtered
through
the
dominant
backbone
of
belgian
yeast
character
present
sharp
echoing
ending
of
bready
pungent
lemon
and
tangerine
citrus
the
overall
exotic
blend
of
fruit
really
does
grow
on
my
palate
through
a
few
sips
and
leaves
me
eager
for
the
next
sip
love
the
can
humor
here
that
poor
bastard
lives
next
to
the
beast
o
nice
can
of
beer
a
very
nice
citrusy
belgian
style
ale
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
decent
amount
of
pure
white
head
smells
a
bit
boozy
with
some
yeasty
aromas
and
a
almost
minty
touch
lots
of
banana
aromas
tastes
banana
heavy
eith
yeastiness
a
typical
belgian
flavour
profile
but
nothing
special
thick
and
low
carbontion
overall
nothing
special
at
all
skål
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
good
beer
for
a
nice
warm
day
would
not
turn
down
if
i
was
presented
the
chance
to
drink
this
again
the
name
and
label
art
are
great
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
orange
body
the
head
was
foamy
and
white
the
head
settles
and
leave
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
yeasty
fruit
aroma
mixed
with
a
subtle
amount
of
spices
the
taste
had
some
citrus
flavors
and
some
other
light
soft
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
slight
hoppiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
lighter
bodied
for
good
drinkablity
overall
i
loved
the
name
of
this
beer
and
thats
why
i
bought
it
i
would
drink
this
one
again
to
see
if
my
thoughts
have
changed
at
all
pretty
good
brew
though
overall
this
beer
carries
its
abv
quite
well
but
i
dont
see
myself
aspiring
to
drink
more
of
this
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
you
know
i
think
ive
now
looked
over
my
past
few
reviews
of
this
style
and
i
honestly
think
now
that
this
style
is
right
up
my
alley
668
is
tasty
stuff
the
cloudy
orange
pour
arrived
into
my
maw
with
a
bit
of
pep
in
its
step
citrusy
a
little
peppery
fruity
phenols
sweet
candy
but
not
overly
sweet
i
couldve
easily
been
fooled
into
thinking
this
beer
was
shipped
from
overseas
an
excellent
american
take
on
this
style
and
a
wonderful
runnerup
choice
for
my
thirsting
mouth
in
search
of
a
different
ipa
or
extra
hops
in
something
different
i
picked
up
the
last
cold

of

spices
and
a

the
abv
of

is
not
something
you
taste
but
start
to
feel
after
two
definitely
on
my
a
list
for

to
share
with
friends
and

a

beer
that
stands
respectably
with
the
beers
that
inspired
it
pahnjun
21
citrusy
and
mellon
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
is
not
a
beer
that
people
will
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
definitely
one
that
beerfanatics
will
want
to
try
very
terrible
beer
luckily
the
high
alcohol
content
numbs
the
mouth
after
a
few
drinks
dont
seek
it
out
but
if
you
want
to
give
it
a
try
its
worth
your
time
oh
my
god
is
this
a
hard
beer
to
drink
basically
it
has
all
the
fixings
of
a
decent
belgian
wheat
banana
cloves
lemon
and
some
malt
but
it
goes
rapidly
downhill
from
there
basically
the
best
way
i
can
put
it
is
pour
a
small
glass
of
an
ok
belgian
pour
a
tablespoon
of
sugar
in
it
and
then
pour
a
shot
of
cheap
vodka
in
it
pretty
much
sums
up
what
is
going
on
in
this
beer
overly
sweet
and
super
boozey
sticky
and
hard
to
drink
im
glad
i
got
it
because
this
beer
had
always
made
me
curious
but
my
curiosity
has
been
piqued
if
you
are
a
an
aficionado
of
high
percentage
beers
try
it
once
and
youll
see
why
you
wont
bother
trying
it
again
simply
put
this
just
isnt
my
kind
of
beer
i
think
it
is
well
executed
and
a
good
treat
but
i
barely
finished
the
small
bottle
i
had
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
i
thought
this
would
be
a
very
unpleasant
experience
such
as
a
bad
malt
liquor
o
this
beer
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
strong
as
its
alcohol
content
but
seems
like
a
belgianinspired
version
of
an
american
malt
liquor
and
something
you
drink
to
get
quickly
buzzed
this
beer
was
a
special
order
for
a
customer
that
changed
his
mind
so
it
was
sitting
in
the
warehouse
waiting
to
be
picked
back
up
from
the
vendor
another
customer
inquired
about
this
beer
and
i
remembered
the
product
from
the
initial
request
amazed
that
we
even
able
to
get
it
let
alone
have
it
in
the
store
the
customer
purchased
the
case
and
gave
a
pack
to
the
store
to
try
i
must
admit
that
this
is
an
interesting
beer
from
the
french
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
much
of
anything
special
from
the
pour
or
nose
however
it
reminds
me
of
a
delicate
pinot
noir
from
burgundy
france
elegance
in
an
8
4
fluid
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
much
bitterness
at
all
its
not
bad
i
think
i
need
to
find
a
much
fresher
specimen
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
pale
malt
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
alcohol
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
sugar
overall
alcohol
was
well
blended
for
13
but
not
a
complex
beer
o
not
well
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
component
is
just
too
overpowering
for
me
which
makes
for
an
uninteresting
beer
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
o
this
beer
is
much
more
like
a
doppelbock
than
a
bspa
an
interesting
beer
but
not
anything
that
wowed
me
it
had
a
rather
flaccid
quality
to
it
actually
perhaps
if
it
had
been
a
more
recent
bottling
date
but
i
suspect
this
falls
into
that
category
of
beer
that
will
appeal
to
certain
tastes
and
for
me
it
was
worth
the
drink
for
sure
but
not
something
i
would
return
to
a
very
disjointed
strong
ale
some
parts
are
tolerable
and
the
rest
is
just
no
i
cant
take
much
of
this
i
hope
the
fauna
below
is
thirsty
original
review
on
08252010
maybe
its
the
age
or
how
the
store
has
been
storing
it
but
this
was
surprisingly
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
store
has
a
dozen
of
more
left
and
at
3
i
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
again
every
so
often
while
its
there
and
stow
a
couple
away
for
longer
overall
i
dont
think
its
worthy
to
pick
up
again
but
overall
very
interesting
and
even
mimics
belgium
brewing
at
its
finest
also
noted
is
the
8
4
fluid
oz
wtf
guys
for
the
price
cant
i
get
an
even
9
foreigners
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
stands
out
in
the
style
the
crisp
fruitiness
dominated
it
a
little
too
much
for
me
decent
tasting
beer
overall
though
i
need
to
try
to
see
if
i
can
find
this
beer
again
but
from
somewhere
that
can
assure
me
that
its
fresh
o
didnt
know
much
about
this
beer
bought
it
on
appearance
of
the
bottle
the
price
tag
was
6
66
thought
it
was
appropriate
a
good
occasional
beer
definitely
warming
would
be
really
good
sometime
around
januaryfebruary
this
could
replace
a
nice
glass
of
brandy
during
the
winter
a
very
nice
strong
ale
i
wouldnt
put
this
in
the
bspa
category
so
i
am
grading
it
accordingly
this
beer
is
just
big
and
sweet
even
the
8
4oz
bottle
size
might
be
to
big
of
a
serving
o
despite
the
smell
i
find
it
a
good
strong
beer
alcohol
is
present
but
some
time
you
want
a
real
kicker
worth
buying
to
try
once
or
twice
if
you
ask
me
jd
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
orange
color
the
head
was
minimal
but
had
a
good
aroma
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fruity
and
yeasty
the
taste
has
a
bready
citrus
flavor
with
some
spices
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
bodied
and
had
a
low
carbonation
level
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
been
meaning
to
pick
more
up
but
have
yet
to
do
so
overall
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
rather
one
dimensional
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
its
high
alcohol
content
it
doesnt
try
to
hide
that
aspect
either
which
makes
it
a
little
difficult
to
drink
it
certainly
wasnt
overpowering
though
just
wouldve
liked
to
see
other
aspects
more
profoundly
presented
notes
slightly
better
than
serviceable
brew
with
nice
flavors
that
hit
all
the
marks
but
its
not
tremendously
compelling
for
some
reason
and
lacking
much
belgian
character
to
some
extent
its
like
a
fortified
by
taste
not
abv
white
wine
and
id
imagine
as
it
is
it
should
work
nicely
as
is
as
a
nighttime
sipper
with
some
bready
dessert
but
aging
melted
the
abv
into
this
device
very
good
overall
notes
not
half
as
extraordinary
as
it
pretends
and
certainly
not
anywhere
near
being
the
most
unique
ale
in
the
world
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
makes
of
its
boozy
profile
its
most
significant
character
but
works
relatively
well
and
makes
for
a
good
drink
overall
a
beer
worth
knowing
strong
ale
which
follows
through
with
expectations
from
initial
nose
to
finish
no
staleness
or
oxidation
which
implies
good
care
on
the
retailers
end
ales
what
cures
ya
and
dont
the
belgians
know
it
certainly
not
an
easy
or
everyday
brew
but
a
very
smooth
example
for
a
barley
wine
type
oh
now
i
get
it
finish
finished
me
wow
this
was
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
hot
dark
fruity
excellent
lacing
a
mild
burn
in
the
back
of
my
throat
if
this
was
not
the
death
of
me
literally
it
may
be
eventually
proceed
with
caution
and
do
not
put
this
in
your
cooler
zounds
belzebuth
is
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
ale
with
a
thin
white
head
that
gets
lumpy
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
overripe
pear
alcohol
and
cardboard
its
smooth
and
pretty
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
it
tastes
pretty
sweet
and
syrupy
with
notes
of
pear
melon
and
allspice
the
finish
brings
the
taste
of
alcohol
black
pepper
and
a
touch
of
phenol
its
not
bad
at
all
its
a
sipper
pours
a
murky
ambercoppery
tone
with
very
little
head
so
obviously
not
much
retention
or
lacing
decent
amount
of
sediment
nose
is
dark
fruity
sweet
malts
a
white
wine
like
character
to
it
surprisingly
little
alcohol
considering
13
abv
which
is
proudly
displayed
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
flavor
is
very
sweet
im
again
reminded
of
a
white
wine
malty
yeast
hint
of
apple
overall
not
bad
borderline
astonishing
how
wellhidden
the
booze
is
i
get
it
in
the
finishaftertaste
but
i
thought
it
would
be
much
more
inyourface
my
initial
reaction
was
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
then
it
warmed
and
i
soured
on
it
just
a
bit
good
in
small
doses
perhaps
also
im
seeing
a
date
on
the
front
thats
a
year
ago
not
specified
if
its
a
bottled
date
or
best
by
date
with
13
im
hoping
for
the
former
might
explain
the
relatively
subdued
alcohol
presence
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
of
my
own
accord
yeah
overall
not
so
good
too
much
alcohol
taste
for
me
personally
if
you
can
deal
with
that
and
actually
like
the
flavors
behind
the
booze
you
might
risk
buying
one
d
the
most
alcoholic
beer
ive
ever
reviewed
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
it
its
light
in
character
while
being
strong
and
assertive
in
taste
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
anticipated
but
in
a
good
way
very
highly
recommended
for
what
it
is
its
great
a
sipping
beer
where
you
may
share
a
single
bottle
with
your
mate
even
at
the
smaller
bottle
size
it
gets
overwhelming
fast
so
grab
a
few
snifters
in
front
of
a
cracking
fire
with
a
beautiful
woman
or
man
and
enjoy
yourself
d
eh
12
oz
is
enough
the
alcohol
hurts
the
drinkablity
but
this
one
isnt
a
big
bottle
nor
is
it
that
bad
of
a
beer
not
bad
not
the
most
unique
in
all
the
world
though
d
creeper
i
was
off
put
at
the
end
by
the
label
the
13
abv
is
advertised
aggressively
alright
but
didnt
wow
me
d
a
sipper
for
sheezy
drinking
such
a
beverage
at
a
rapid
pace
will
certainly
lead
to
questionable
decisions
a
decent
beer
with
pleasant
orange
character
alcohol
a
bit
much
at
times
but
certainly
worth
the
3
75
i
threw
down
on
it
at
ye
olde
qfer
d
again
surprisingly
good
i
thought
this
would
be
a
very
slow
sipper
with
a
really
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
drank
1
bottle
easily
but
could
feel
the
alcohol
so
one
was
enough
and
i
do
agree
with
the
label
its
a
unique
ale
quite
good
albeit
for
the
unexpected
aroma
that
turned
into
an
interesting
savory
base
for
this
strong
ale
rather
distinct
the
body
was
good
full
round
and
smooth
without
being
heavy
or
thick
drinkability
was
very
good
for
a
beer
this
strong
overall
a
decent
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
abv
13
not
11
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
dark
golden
in
color
with
little
head
smells
mostly
of
sour
green
grapes
with
some
vinegaralcohol
like
bursts
taste
is
mostly
apple
juice
and
grapes
with
a
strong
alcohol
burn
finish
alcohol
is
prevalent
and
this
doesnt
have
much
else
to
redeem
itself
not
really
much
in
terms
in
flavor
but
i
guess
for
the
abv
it
is
fairly
drinkable
im
reviewing
this
beer
and
setting
my
personal
and
political
convictions
aside
considering
its
a
french
beer
got
this
as
a
gift
but
wouldnt
buy
it
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
belgian
blonde
ale
all
i
can
say
is
meh
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
but
this
is
not
one
for
mass
quantities
one
bottle
will
do
you
this
is
a
unique
but
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoy
it
lovely
ok
beer
but
i
much
prefer
the
uberhopped
pirate
beers
whats
surprising
is
the
booze
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
sweetness
of
the
flavor
brasserie
grain
dorge
belzebuth
is
more
interesting
than
it
is
good
having
said
that
any
beer
that
calls
to
mind
honey
liqueur
mead
and
malt
liquor
is
okay
by
me
even
if
ill
never
lay
out
the
cash
for
another
bottle
very
unique
brew
glad
to
have
tried
and
enjoyed
it
worked
well
this
cool
fall
day
drinkability
nothing
special
more
like
a
fruity
barley
wine
than
a
belgian
ale
it
feel
like
the
brewers
got
a
bit
to
carried
away
with
hitting
a
big
abv
than
creating
a
balanced
beer
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
good
for
special
occasions
for
a
strong
beer
such
as
this
its
actually
quite
drinkable
there
is
coarse
and
prickly
carbonation
upfront
and
delves
into
a
light
syrupy
finish
the
alcohol
is
very
detectable
in
the
end
which
finishes
with
a
slight
burn
poured
a
dark
golden
color
into
glass
very
little
head
and
bubbles
the
smell
of
grapes
fruits
off
the
glass
nice
strong
taste
but
definitely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
alcohol
back
end
good
drinkability
and
tasty
overall
i
like
this
beer
for
being
13
abv
and
very
drinkable
i
tried
others
with
this
high
alcohol
content
and
they
pretty
much
tasted
like
old
shoes
easily
a
four
pack
night
d
i
dont
know
if
i
would
put
this
back
after
just
the
one
a
little
much
for
me
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
the
nice
flavors
get
overpowered
by
the
untamed
alcohol
strong
beer
with
strong
flavors
but
i
cant
say
that
id
recommend
this
taste
is
unique
but
good
very
interesting
sweet
warm
from
the
13
alcohol
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
i
do
enjoy
it
a
lot
drinks
easy
probably
too
easy
for
something
with
so
much
alcohol
give
it
a
try
mfd
the
only
problem
is
that
the
brew
is
too
thick
this
is
a
natural
side
effect
of
having
so
much
alcohol
the
body
is
full
while
it
should
be
a
mediumfull
at
most
the
higher
fullness
being
attributed
to
an
increase
in
carbonation
which
is
acceptable
the
beer
however
does
not
gain
fullness
from
extra
carbonation
which
is
quite
well
proportioned
for
a
full
body
beer
the
body
itself
is
making
it
the
beer
full
which
is
not
a
good
thing
the
drinkability
is
then
going
to
suffer
for
this
style
as
it
should
be
lighter
and
more
bubbly
easier
to
go
down
the
alcohol
is
also
a
detriment
to
a
degree
one
too
many
of
these
guys
will
put
you
in
the
nut
house
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
that
borders
on
great
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
more
present
and
the
high
alcohol
content
does
make
this
less
than
a
standard
blonde
ale
however
if
i
were
to
submit
this
for
judging
id
throw
this
under
the
speciality
beer
category
and
take
a
chance
there
this
is
a
good
nearly
great
beer
but
should
not
be
considered
the
standard
bearer
for
strong
blonde
ales
drinkability
let
it
live
a
bit
in
the
bottle
this
is
an
older
one
this
is
what
it
takes
i
imagine
try
it
a
big
one
while
belzebuth
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
feels
like
a
waste
of
a
whole
bunch
of
barley
the
color
is
just
fine
golden
dried
barley
at
sunset
and
has
good
retention
lacing
etc
i
tend
to
find
bspas
on
the
boring
side
of
appearance
though
the
smell
just
isnt
right
i
can
sense
the
belgianish
yeast
but
the
bland
sour
notes
of
cheap
lager
make
an
unexpected
and
unappreciated
appearance
im
surprised
that
this
fancy
little
french
bottle
of
extra
potent
brew
shares
aroma
notes
with
malt
liquor
these
off
notes
dont
show
up
on
the
palate
but
its
a
turnoff
for
me
my
turnons
include
long
walks
on
the
beach
verticals
of
anything
and
cheap
sours
sorry
anywho
the
flavor
is
definitely
boozy
but
there
are
some
good
undercurrents
of
belgian
earth
and
stone
fruit
surprisingly
there
isnt
a
strong
malt
flavor
the
color
aroma
and
abv
made
me
expect
a
bit
maltiness
but
the
sweetness
is
fairly
bland
and
the
booziness
overpowers
anything
else
feel
and
drinkability
arent
great
even
for
beers
in
this
weight
class
these
12
abv
beers
seem
to
be
distinctly
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
a
miss
for
me
i
wouldnt
recommend
twoit
is
13abv
with
that
in
mind
however
its
not
a
bad
beverage
if
your
objective
is
aligned
with
the
belzebuth
from
the
outset
this
might
be
the
beer
best
suited
for
you
flavor
mirrors
the
nose
well
muscadine
grapes
are
all
i
keep
thinking
about
as
i
drink
this
by
far
the
most
vinous
beer
i
have
had
a
bare
hint
of
yeast
funk
comes
into
play
along
with
the
smoothest
13
alcohol
i
have
ever
had
boozy
never
comes
to
mind
with
this
one
for
me
although
this
is
definitely
not
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
i
would
classify
this
as
a
must
try
just
for
the
sheer
uniqueness
of
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
25l

taste
is
yeasty
and
medicinal
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
cant
hold
a
candle
compared
to
the
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
duvel
mediumbodied
beer
that
has
a
chewey
breadiness
to
it
and
comprises
itself
of
a
good
amount
of
caramelized
malts
and
other
sugary
goodness
cane
also
has
some
yeast
and
tart
fruit
tastes
mostly
pear
and
orange
for
balance
kinda
like
a
white
wine
kinda
has
a
hoppy
crisp
backbite
w
very
little
alcohol
burn
or
even
notice
they
hide
the
abv
quite
well
given
its
amount
a
sipper
in
terms
of
taste
and
abv
but
definitely
the
one
i
sipped
on
was
pretty
good
this
is
a
bloody
good
beer
i
am
finding
more
and
more
french
brews
worth
drinking
this
being
the
second
from
this
brewery
t
warm
mouthfeel
all
the
flavor
feels
elevated
in
the
palate
weak
on
carbonation
which
adds
to
brandy
sensation
already
attributed
by
the
high
alcohol
content
sweet
caramel
and
light
i
personally
dont
think
the
alcohol
was
as
noticeable
apart
from
the
warming
but
others
are
more
sensitive
to
it
and
subsequently
repulsed
i
thought
it
was
quite
drinkable
like
a
meatier
white
wine
not
wortwhile
opinion
well
this
beer
is
big
no
doubt
it
really
doesnt
come
across
as
all
that
drinkable
of
a
brew
there
is
alcohol
and
the
beer
itself
is
rather
dry
it
is
like
a
highend
malt
liquor
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
is
ok
that
they
got
the
abv
that
high
but
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
that
often
definatly
interesting
its
a
sipper
for
sure
this
is
not
somthing
i
could
have
often
but
its
a
good
brew
to
give
a
whirl
fruity
stuff
more
easily
drinkable
than
i
had
been
anticipating
definitely
not
too
bad
more
of
a
sipper
though
than
anything
due
to
the
fact
that
the
high
alcohol
content
cannot
be
ignored
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
very
strong
beers
but
this
one
was
quite
good
d
this
is
an
average
version
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
even
if
the
alcohol
was
masked
better
its
taste
is
still
not
that
clean
or
complex
overall
not
pleasant
at
all
too
much
alcohol
that
overpowers
everything
this
beer
is
a
drain
pour
i
cant
recommend
this
at
all
notes
from
53104
drinkability
whew
definitely
a
candidate
for
a
slow
sipper
seems
to
forgo
subtle
complexities
and
finesse
for
a
punchy
booziness
good
not
great
beer
d
good
hell
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
the
first
one
was
great
the
sent
of
raw
alcohal
hits
your
nose
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
bottle
poured
a
light
orange
color
with
a
heavy
2
finger
head
that
dwindeled
down
to
a
dusting
of
white
around
the
entire
beer
the
flavor
is
raw
alchoal
from
start
to
finish
the
start
is
a
tad
sour
then
the
alochal
takes
over
untill
you
get
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
ther
is
no
real
lasting
aftertaste
on
this
one
the
alochal
mellows
as
it
warms
this
one
is
a
siper
for
sure
and
at
13
it
sneeks
op
on
you
i
realy
liked
this
one
d
13
is
not
going
to
be
too
drinkable
unfortunately
this
is
pretty
good
though
great
for
a
cold
night
and
you
have
no
responsibilites
the
next
morning
this
is
an
attractive
hazy
amber
approaching
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
while
poured
this
in
a
flute
and
the
carbonation
was
like
champagne
smell
was
rather
hot
with
some
orange
spicyness
and
some
light
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
strong
with
prevelant
alcohol
slight
carmel
flavors
with
floral
notes
a
great
strong
beer
p
s
a
little
too
pricey
for
the
goods
im
glad
this
one
comes
in
8
4
fl
oz
bottles
as
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
more
than
that
overall
it
was
just
alright
for
me
am
i
randy
jackson
now
worth
trying
as
almost
any
beer
is
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
10
minute
later
edit
okay
so
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
blasting
the
capabilities
and
discretion
of
my
palate
or
if
maybe
after
some
vigorous
pouring
of
the
rest
and
some
warming
the
beer
seems
to
have
changed
the
off
flavors
seem
to
decrease
and
some
decent
breadiness
accompanies
the
fuller
mouthfeel
i
mean
its
starting
to
be
a
decent
although
simpler
beer
fairly
high
bitter
finish
with
an
extreme
alcohol
burn
poured
a
rich
amber
with
about
a
pencil
size
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
smell
the
bread
some
fruit
and
alcohol
as
soon
as
i
filled
the
tulip
glass
i
used
for
this
brew
the
taste
comes
across
as
a
bit
sweet
at
first
followed
by
some
malt
than
the
alcohol
presents
itself
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
surpassed
my
expectations
for
such
a
strong
beer
the
more
i
drink
this
the
better
it
gets
d
ok
cmon
you
cant
have
a
few
of
these
without
passing
out
with
an
8
4
oz
bottle
two
of
these
would
seriously
buzz
me
up
so
this
one
is
not
a
session
brew
by
any
means
great
beer
for
the
uniqueness
but
im
not
sure
id
get
this
one
again
d
a
little
to
bit
over
the
top
not
well
balanced
and
only
recommend
for
those
who
like
to
try
everything

warms
the
belly
i
dont
give
a
crap
about
woodstock
1st

from
ls
decent

an
enjoyable
beer
that
went
down
quite
easily
perpahs
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
smell
is
reminiscent
of
apple
juice
not
cider
appearance
similarly
has
a
deeper
amber
hue
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweetness
that
adds
to
a
slight
boozey

very
alcoholic

fizzy

still
somehow
not
too
difficult
to
drink
despite
the
high

a
bit
warming
going
down
okay
but
not
something
i
want
again
d
we
had
this
as
an
after
dinner
treat
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
like
i
said
it
comes
in
a
3
pack
of
8
4
oz
bottles
13
abv
and
im
still
pounding
this
one
too
easy
to
drink
well
done
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
sipping
brew
meant
to
be
appreciated
over
a
decent
amount
of
time
that
being
said
the
curiously
restrained
profile
on
the
palate
allows
more
subtle
flavors
to
show
through
without
drowning
them
out
with
rich
flavors
up
front
nciely
crafted
cheers
i
was
accidentally
undercharged
for
this
bottle
of
brew
and
should
that
happen
again
i
would
very
easily
revisit
it
drinkability
is
eh
though
in
a
the
context
of
an
after
dinner
or
desert
beer
it
could
be
higher
if
prepared
to
sip
overall
pretty
interesting
something
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
soon
but
as
i
said
in
the
right
context
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
this
beer
really
is
the
devil
had
it
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
fine
head
then
it
went
down
from
there
smell
was
of
a
mild
cherry
liquer
with
some
rum
notes
taste
was
like
drinking
vodka
but
without
the
harsh
aftertaste
alcohol
just
dominated
and
it
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
couldnt
get
over
the
grain
alcohol
tase
on
the
palate
i
definitely
couldnt
stand
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
was
very
apprehensive
at
first
fearing
this
would
taste
like
samichlaus
due
to
the
high
alcohol
thankfully
unlike
that
beer
this
is
actually
drinkable
though
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
i
would
say
that
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
curious
appearance
is
a
orange
brown
with
sediment
floating
around
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
leaving
a
very
nice
lace
smells
a
little
belgiumy
with
spice
sweet
with
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
has
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
all
the
way
down
with
spice
and
dark
fruits
having
a
mouthfeel
that
is
a
light
i
really
do
like
how
the
sediment
just
floats
around
the
glass
and
never
settles
on
the
bottom
but
one
bottle
is
enough
to
last
me
awhile
despite
the
above
note
the
high
alcohol
content
doesnt
make
this
hard
going
down
the
overbearing
sweetness
does
though
im
not
in
a
rush
to
revisit
this
though
im
interested
in
laying
one
down
for
a
while
and
taking
it
on
then
d
seems
like
a
novelty
beer
the
sweetness
that
comes
with
an
abv
this
high
requires
bitterness
sourness
acidity
or
something
to
provide
balance
this
doesnt
really
have
it
a
semicomplex
brew
with
too
much
sweetness
and
too
much
booze
to
be
particularly
interesting
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
spending
my
money
on
it
again
the
aroma
was
malt
dominated
with
a
spiciness
to
it
the
flavor
was
all
malt
and
spicy
all
around
it
was
nicely
carbonated
and
touched
the
roof
of
the
mouth
with
the
spicy
hanging
around
for
a
while
it
was
a
good
beer
but
one
i
would
probably
have
once
a
year
or
every
other
year
overall
i
bought
this
because
it
sounded
crazy
and
it
was
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
drinkability
sigh
a
second
drain
pour
in
a
row
drank
about
half
and
figured
my
mouth
is
used
to
better
than
this

i
wouldnt
drink
this
quickly
or
drinnk
more
than
one
in
an
evening
but
id
like
to
enjoy
this
again
in
the
middle
of
winter
near
my
fireplace
overall
it
was
a
nice
cold
weather
beer
id
have
it
again
plus
it
gives
you
enough
for
a
while
to
relax
with
2
5
belzebuth
has
some
nice
qualities
but
some
unpleasant
faults
it
is
complex
and
interesting
but
i
do
not
think
i
going
to
look
for
another
bottle
this
reminds
me
of
another
brew
i
bought
a
case
of
about
two
years
ago
it
was
strong
and
it
took
forever
for
me
to
finish
all
the
bottles
the
novelty
of
having
a
high
alcohol
content
is
nice
but
ive
yet
to
find
a
balanced
brew
that
pushes
past
the
10
barrier
drinkability
just
isnt
there
ive
had
some
big
beers
including
120
min
ipa
at
21
abv
and
they
all
drink
easier
than
this
13
beast
the
alcohol
simply
isnt
complemented
by
any
complexity
snobby
as
that
sounds
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
very
nice
amber
color
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
surprisingly
mild
but
one
taste
and
you
can
defiantly
taste
the
alcohol
very
smooth
for
the
13
abv
very
sweet
taste
like
a
port
not
a
beer
id
drink
everyday
or
a
lot
of
but
more
than
enough
in
the
small
8oz
bottle
although
it
can
compliment
food
well
this
is
really
more
of
an
after
dinner
or
desert
beer
its
big
and
bad
but
it
finds
a
way
not
to
be
very
complex
its
actually
a
little
difficult
to
continue
with
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
such
a
cumbersome
presence
other
big
beers
use
extraordinary
characteristics
to
hide
accentuate
and
complement
high
alcohol
content
but
the
pale
malt
and
paltry
hops
stand
no
chance
against
fully
fermented
barley
pass
on
this
booze
bomb
unless
you
want
just
that
quite
clear
for
a
13
beer
that
was
impressive
nice
golden
straw
color
smells
like
old
plums
and
figs
tastes
almost
like
an
early
port
with
a
leathery
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
back
of
your
throat
and
warms
your
belly
you
should
split
this
one
with
a
friend
or
four
whaoh
i
guess
the
ahhhh
drinkablity
fell
slightly
beacuse
of
the
burning
abv
but
a
fun
beer
to
try
one
of
if
you
like
beer
and
brandy
you
probably
will
appreciate
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
prefer
a
brew
that
tastes
like
beer
rather
than
hard
booze
i
like
some
hardtolike
beers
but
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
at
all
the
flavor
was
way
too
simple
for
such
a
stong
beer
the
alcohol
was
also
way
too
stong
for
me
with
nothing
to
back
it
up
it
was
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
highly
recommended
md
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
one
you
drink
everyday
i
dont
think
but
it
is
good
and
worth
trying
a
heavy
and
funky
selection
not
for
the
casual
everyday
kind
of
drinking
could
serve
as
a
nightcap
for
a
spring
evening
drinkability
interesting
flavors
and
alcohol
in
this
beer
for
its
strength
its
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
not
biting
or
harsh
but
it
does
show
a
pleasant
mellowing
brew
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
goldenstraw
color
the
smell
is
cereal
and
somewhat
fruity
the
taste
is
grain
like
and
sweet
it
does
have
a
bit
of
an
orange
flavor
overall
the
flavors
do
a
good
job
of
masking
the
high
alcohol
content
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
felt
as
for
drinkability

one
seems
to
be
enough
i
reviewed
the
13
version
after
i
drank
it
i
noted
i
paid
3
89
for
what
was
only
an
8
4
oz
bottle
and
there
was
some
sediment
so
i
left
a
bit
in
the
bottle
seems
a
bit
pricey
in
retrospect
dont
be
caught
offguard
easy
to
drink
for
a
13er
candylike
sweetness
but
not
cloying
a
nice
sipping
treat
that
is
too
easy
to
more
than
sip
if
you
like
highalcohol
beers
this
is
a
good
one
a
beautiful
beer
in

i
say
its

be

a
conversation
starter
a
bit
too
brutish
to
enjoy
as
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
drinkability
was
outstanding
especially
when
considering
that
this
beer
is
a
whopping
13
abv
the
alcohol
did
however
catch
up
with
me
in
a
big
way
after
i
was
finished
ive
had
this
beer
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
at
13
i
figured
it
could
age
well
and
it
did
there
was
some
sediment
expected
that
settled
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
poured
it
into
a
snifter
and
enjoyed
the
eforvensence
spelling
of
tiny
bubbles
that
continued
throughout
the
drinking
this
is
a
devilish
little
beer
8oz
at
13
it
packs
quite
a
whollop
but
is
a
great
experience
i
smell
strong
citrus
and
exotic
flowers
very
very
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
you
can
only
drink
one
of
these
a
night
but
its
worth
it
available
in
cute
little
3packs
a
definate
must
buy
pours
orange
with
tons
of
junk
floating
around
in
it
and
not
much
head
half
a
point
for
all
the
floaties
fruity
fermenting
apple
cider
odor
syrupy
mouthfeel
taste
is
like
hazlenuts
cocoa
butter
alcohol
faily
well
hidden
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
the
chunks
were
maybe
a
bit
too
big
a
big
one
hit
the
back
of
my
throat
on
the
last
swig
which
greatly
diminished
the
entire
drinking
experience
i
was
unimpressed
by
this
beer
chunks
to
the
extreme
this
clearish
redbrown
brew
has
huge
chunks
that
just
float
around
in
it
its
downright
evil
looking
nose
is
syrupy
sweet
apple
hops
taste
is
heavy
on
the
ethanol
with
syrupy
hops
and
then
a
long
dry
ethanol
finish
not
hidden
well
at
all
mouthfeel
is
chunky
and
syrupy
drinkability
is
really
hurt
by
the
alcohol
content
bottom
line
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
if
it
was
in
the
stores
here
i
would
not
bother
buying
it
again
i
really
think
this
would
improve
with
some
age
on
it
k
aste
is
also
very
much
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
with
an
after
taste
of
boiled
vegetables
i
think
this
is
my
2nd
beer
from
france
and
all
i
have
to
say
is
leave
the
brewing
to
the
belgians
looks
nice
pours
a
golden
orange
color
smells
though
like
cheap
malt
liquor
tastes
like
somebody
put
vodka
in
a
malt
liquor
real
harsh
alcohol
burn
overall
its
a
pretty
picture
that
just
gets
ugly
real
fast
i
did
finish
it
but
im
only
going
to
remember
it
as
being
another
dissapointing
beer
try
at
your
own
risk
i
woulnt
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
will
definately
be
having
this
again
a
great
beer
to
finish
a
rich
meal
this
is
worth
seeking
out
lots
of
alcohol
here
but
the
candi
sugar
covers
everything
much
too
hot
to
be
refreshing
the
body
is
fairly
light
to
medium
with
a
mouthfeel
of
warm
almost
hot
alcohol
dominating
this
brew
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
drinker
beware
13abv
chacheers
the
taste
is
very
pungent
if
a
taste
can
be
said
to
be
pungent
alcoholic
and
phenolic
actually
leaves
a
bitter
taste
for
all
that
highalcohol
sweetness
but
its
a
phenolic
bitter
taste
and
quite
offputting
just
doesnt
taste
natural
to
me
as
it
warms
it
becomes
much
more
tolerable
but
in
the
end
i
was
glad
i
only
had
25cl
of
it
belzebuth
13
alcohol
fruits
plants
and
a
little
malty
in
the
nose
nice
feeling
on
the
palate
with
a
alcohol
lingering
you
do
feel
all
13
of
them
could
benefit
from
a
more
subtle
alcohol
feel
since
after
the
first
two
gulps
you
tend
to
get
your
palate
ready
for
that
overall
nice
beer
its
hard
to
even
think
of
having
another
one
right
after
this
brew
pours
a
clear
reddishglod
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
fairly
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
the
aroma
is
clean
overall
with
herbal
and
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
with
floral
and
herbal
flavors
coming
through
in
the
sip
the
finish
starts
with
a
faint
alcohol
burn
that
grows
more
and
more
intense
until
it
is
too
much
for
enjoyments
sake
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
but
nothing
special
overall
i
purchased
this
beer
not
knowing
what
it
was
when
i
found
out
it
was
a
euro
strong
ale
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
my
decision
to
buy
it
needless
to
say
my
expectations
for
this
beer
were
rather
low
however
they
where
all
greatly
exceeded
this
beer
is
by
no
means
great
but
it
does
have
more
flavor
and
aroma
than
other
euro
strong
ales
with
that
said
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
as
it
seems
more
of
an
alcohol
delivery
system
than
a
true
craft
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
a
bit
heavy
almost
like
a
beerenauslesse
wine
i
didnt
find
it
sickening
sweet
like
syrup
but
it
is
definately
higher
in
viscosity
than
most
beers
its
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
but
definately
not
a
session
beer
its
a
once
in
awhile
sipping
beer
that
is
best
savored
slowly
d
moderate
the
burn
lowers
it
slightly
its
ok
definitely
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
so
far
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
in
this
case
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
way
too
sickly
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
too
high
percentage
and
too
sweet
to
drink
again
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
the
guys
at
peabodys
warned
it
would
take
the
enamel
off
your
teeth
and
i
am
now
considering
a
trip
to
the
dentist
the
beer
is
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
there
was
a
small
head
the
smell
is
is
a
hint
to
the
coming
alcohol
the
taste
is
not
much
except
huge
alcohol
anything
in
the
mouthfeel
is
masked
by
the
huge
abv
the
drinkability
is
not
high
because
of
this
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
a
very
potent
brew
the
aftertaste
is
like
that
of
much
harder
booze
drinkability
a
better
beer
than
most
of
the
strong
pale
euro
lager
variety
maybe
the
alcohol
masks
some
off
flavors
but
it
is
very
drinkable
ill
give
this
one
another
whirl
later
on
down
the
road
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
inspite
of
the
bite
drinkability
i
wouldnt
recommend
any
more
than
one
in
a
session
and
that
only
occasionally
being
such
a
strong
beer
the
makers
of
this
one
also
encourage
some
responsibility
to
be
taken
in
drinking
it
by
presenting
it
in
a
smaller
than
standard
bottle
approximately
78oz
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
it
wont
find
a
home
in
my
regular
pantheon
of
malty
delights
this
is
very
elegant
drinking
the
13
alcohol
content
is
well
integrated
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
beer
has
good
drinkabilty
nothing
about
it
impresses
me
enough
to
seek
it
out
but
id
drink
it
again
if
someones
buying
pours
a
very
light
golden
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
my
glass
this
beer
smells
of
all
malt
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
with
no
hop
presence
i
can
smell
alittle
bit
of
rice
in
there
also
there
is
very
little
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
which
suprised
me
due
to
the
abv
the
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
fruit
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
little
bottles
light
body
and
smoothness
make
it
possible
to
have
much
more
than
one
of
these
tastes
pretty
smooth
for
13abv
there
is
a
fruitiness
with
the
grain
bill
that
i
cannot
properly
describe
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
without
being
syrupy
drinkability
is
ok
eh
this
one
is
alright
there
are
much
better
representations
of
this
style
out
there
but
for
a
french
beer
ill
give
it
a
thumbs
up
d
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
would
buy
again
you
really
do
not
get
much
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
pours
a
sort
of
pale
marigold
with
a
very
minimal
and
distressed
looking
head
nose
is
slightly
fruity
with
plenty
of
alcohol
as
well
some
candyish
sweetness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
oily
and
slick
with
a
big
malty
taste
and
all
kinds
of
warming
slight
burn
on
the
first
few
sips
finish
is
very
clean
and
the
aftertaste
is
nice
this
isnt
quite
as
offputting
as
i
had
expected
but
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
i
dont
love
this
beer
although
it
is
worth
a
try
certainly
different
i
would
say
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
drinkability
but
be
careful
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
thick
mouth
feel
and
high
alcohol
content
also
the
flavor
does
not
agree
with
me
uf
notes
i
like
my
beer
sweet
strong
and
warming
my
favourite
style
is
barleywines
so
this
is
a
beer
i
enjoyed
and
would
drink
again
occasionally
my
main
gripe
is
that
although
this
is
a
strong
beer
i
always
find
8oz
is
never
quite
enough
it
seems
the
suggestion
is
ooh
this
is
so
strong
we
only
dare
package
it
in
such
small
quantities
its
not
a
marketing
technique
that
im
particularly
fond
of
and
i
for
one
was
highly
delighted
when
anchor
moved
old
foghorn
from
8oz
to
12oz
bottles
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
head
or
lacing
relative
to
beer
in
general
but
a
surprising
amount
given
the
13
abv
i
was
expecting
to
smell
alcohol
and
there
is
a
bit
but
mostly
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
hefeweizen
and
a
euro
lagerfunky
bubblegum
alcohol
is
more
noticeable
in
the
flavor
but
still
not
overly
obnoxious
considering
this
is
a
13
beer
named
after
satan
behind
the
alcohol
are
more
weizen
characters
definitely
strong
but
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
drinkability
as
for
being
the
most
unique
ale
its
definitely
interesting
but
not
even
the
most
weizeny
nonweizen
ive
had
in
the
last
week
that
honor
goes
to
the
new
glarus
smoked
rye
bock
no
interesting
complexities
to
ponder
probably
wouldnt
pay
for
another
notes
i
review
13
version
one
time
is
enough
not
gonna
eat
it
again
drinkabilityvery
easy
to
drink
because
of
it
weakness
as
far
as
bold
flavors
go
if
this
werent
such
a
high
abv
i
could
honestly
see
this
as
a
top
session
beer
for
the
euro
lager
lovers
it
definately
hits
the
mind
and
makes
it
do
summersaults
iii
thinnkkk
i
ammmm
feeeellllinnnng
itttt
enjoyed
at
my
favorite
local
establishmentpazzos
surprising
to
find
such
balance
in
a
highgravity
lager
very
sweet
and
aromatic
to
the
nose
fruity
floral
honeysuckle
and
sweet
spices
ooh
yea
alcohol
apprearance
is
a
still
copperorange
color
with
alcohol
legs
all
over
the
rim
obviously
meant
to
be
sampled
like
a
brandy
tastes
very
sweet
and
malty
honey
flavors
all
over
the
place
nice
hop
aroma
but
not
so
much
in
the
flavor
bittered
only
for
balance
fruit
flavors
of
dates
plumbs
grapes
apples
cherriesall
of
the
overripe
variety
thin
syrupy

oily

the

hot
and
spicy
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
is
accentuated
by
the
alcohol
as
well
alcohols
are
mildly
fusal
and
phenolic
otherwise
nice
for
such
a
punch
finishes
sticky
sweet
shes
a
sipper
cheers
beertracker
as
others
have
suggested
take
this
brew
as
i
think
it
was
meant
to
be
taken
not
as
a
quaffer
but
an
apertif
to
be
sipped
over
a
long
period
more
like
a
brandywine
than
a
lager
so
drink
it
as
such
this
is
not
a
beer
for
day
use
this
is
night
cap
material
at
best
the
wicked
looking
dragonperson
on
the
label
should
tell
the
story
and
it
does
indeed
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
strong
and
bold
mouthfeel
is
light
though
the
taste
lingers
at
least
the
hoppy
and
not
the
buttery
yeasty
part
does
not
pleasant
to
be
a
staple
honest
but
very
as
a
occasional
treat
drinkable
dr
more
of
a
curiosity
satisfaction
than
anything
else
nothing
special
really
better
barleywines
blow
this
away
tastes
a
little
like
an
oak
aged
barley
wine
this
would
probably
be
a
good
after
dinner
beer
all
hot
cherries
and
malt
one
moe
thing
if
you
cellar
this
major
scrod
chunks
grow
this
is
an
interesting
experience
it
must
be
sipped
try
one
just
for
the
challenge
of
consuming
a
13
alcohol
beverage
13
abv
version
the
color
is
honey
amber
with
a
moderate
haziness
rather
large
chunks
of
sediment
float
around
in
the
beer
head
is
of
a
good
size
and
somewhat
creamy
the
aroma
is
of
rich
malts
mixed
with
a
strong
astringent
alcohol
smell
taste
also
consists
of
rich
malt
flavors
joined
by
alcohol
astringency
alcohol
taste
here
is
a
little
bit
too
much
for
me
even
though
it
provides
an
interesting
spicysour
flavor
some
herbal
hop
flavor
comes
through
especially
in
the
finish
belzebuth
is
very
warming
from
the
throat
to
the
stomach
and
could
easily
work
as
a
winter
brew
drinkability
for
me
would
be
only
one
a
night
if
i
wanted
this
much
alcohol
i
would
rather
pick
up
an
eisbock
interesting
beer
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
pours
a
clear
mandarin
orange
color
with
floaties
that
are
hard
to
keep
out
of
the
tulip
crystal
glas
a
1
or
2
finger
frothy
white
head
fades
to
collar
and
persistant
lacing
the
aroma
is
simple
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
pale
malt
and
vodka
like
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
surprizingly
thick
i
worry
that
the
carbonation
will
leave
me
to
soon
but
it
stays
around
till
the
end
this
is
a
sipping
beer
that
needs
some
getting
use
to
at
40f
some
flavors
are
hidden
nearer
50
the
malts
emerge
a
dry
finish
but
not
from
the
hops
i
never
found
them
respect
beer
this
is
not
a
session
candidate
250

my
bottle
says
15
abv
this
one
has
been
in
the
fridge
for
a
long
time
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
was
filled
with
yeast
fluff
which
the
beer
was
carefully
decanted
off
of
and
left
behind
full
mouthfeel
that
is
subdued
by
the
alcohol
that
becomes
numbing
after
five
or
so
sips
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
high
abv
which
over
powers
this
brew
poured
a
clear
medium
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
fell
to
a
film
across
the
top
the
smell
was
sweet
fruits
grains
and
some
floral
scents
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
honey
and
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slightly
syrupy
and
nicely
carbonated
i
cant
say
however
that
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
one
is
more
than
enough
i
wanted
to
be
strong
and
indifferent
for
this
french
beer
but
it
really
wasnt
that
bad
at
all
ill
have
to
find
some
more
of
this
style
to
compare
to
give
it
a
try
thanks
to
steve
h
for
sharing
this
rare
monster
drinkability
this
stuff
has
hangover
written
all
over
it
its
distinctive
and
worth
a
try
is
the
perfect
classification
id
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
venture
2
of
these
in
the
same
evening
lest
the
prince
of
darkness
himself
attempt
to
abscond
with
me
very
soul
dthis
is
a
pretty
sweet
malt
beer
with
a
hint
of
hops
that
balances
out
and
even
hides
the
alcohol
warmth
the
sweet
malt
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
i
wish
the
hops
or
alcohol
or
lesssweet
maltyness
would
stand
up
to
the
sweetness
it
was
also
a
bit
too
fizzy
for
a
nice
high
alcohol
beer
had
this
french
brew
for
the
first
time
at
eola
wine
company
in
orlando

separate
review
last
week
the
13
alcohol
is
masked
quite
a
bit
and
creeps
up
on
you
however
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
on
my
second
night
trying
this
one
i
had
2
in
a
row
and
the
second
one
really
nailed
me
interesting
brew
for
sure
nothing
especially
noteworthy
except
maybe
for
the
kick
but
the
overall
package
does
unexpectedly
come
together
nicely
on
the
maltysweet
side
but
with
a
bit
of
hop
nose
at
the
beginning
nice
lacing
for
such
a
high
alcoholic
brew
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
although
one
per
night
will
probably
be
my
limit
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
with
some
punch
try
this
one
thanks
to
ewcs
jennifer
for
suggesting
this
one
to
mevery
nice
choice
joi
de
vive
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
some
floaties
and
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
strong
pale
and
carapils
malt
scent
that
reaks
of
alcohol
it
is
dry
and
devoid
of
much
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
a
very
thick
and
rich
beer
with
loads
of
pale
malts
and
a
dry
warm
finish
it
goes
down
slow
like
liquor
but
is
pretty
damn
tastey
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
strong
lager
its
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
but
not
at
all
bad
it
has
a
good
taste
and
decent
mouthfeel
a
copper
beer
with
orange
highlights
has
a
small
creamy
off
white
head
and
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
sour
with
a
heavy
dose
of
grain
made
me
think
of
what
a
bag
of
malt
might
smell
like
if
it
were
to
get
wet
and
sit
for
too
long
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
background
the
alcohol
rushes
to
the
back
of
your
throat
and
a
sweet
licorice
flavor
settles
over
your
tongue
there
is
a
ghost
of
graininess
after
the
finish
drinkability
with
the
unbalanced
flavors
at
the
beginning
its
hard
to
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
its
big
but
not
in
a
great
way
but
it
certianly
helped
to
put
me
to
sleep
better
than
any
pill
off
the
shelf
lay
down
after
you
drink
this
one
while
this
isnt
as
big
as
it
could
be
the
abv
keeps
this
from
being
a
serious
session
brew
still
its
not
a
bad
sipper
if
only
it
was
at
least
a
normal
euro
11
2oz
size
id
feel
it
was
a
little
more
worth
what
it
costs
this
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
peachy
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
really
strange
its
almost
like
a
liquor
the
malts
are
super
sweet
almost
candylike
wow
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
for
this
huge
ass
beer
the
sweetness
in
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
there
is
almost
a
belgian
peppery
quality
to
it
the
sweetness
lends
an
orange
tone
to
it
i
like
it
the
beer
is
thick
and
full
in
my
mouth
drinkability
is
okay
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
i
like
it
but
can
only
handle
one
every
so
often
thanks
to
clvand0
for
this
beer
notes
it
really
isnt
anything
special
nothing
stands
out
alcohol
isnt
hidden
as
well
as
i
hoped
probably
worth
trying
definitely
a
slow
sipping
beer
clear
deep
golden
tone
carbonation
rises
at
a
rapid
clip
good
sized
white
head
shows
good
retention
and
cling
the
nose
is
all
malt
and
alcohol
more
malt
than
alcohol
dopplebockish
in
its
aroma
body
is
full
and
viscous
but
there
is
some
carbonation
present
to
prevent
this
from
becoming
overly
syrupy
which
it
could
do
i
would
assume
theres
a
good
amount
of
heat
in
this
brew
not
covered
up
as
well
as
in
samiclaus
a
lingering
alcohol
bitterness
stays
around
for
a
while
rum
soaked
melon
and
raisins
deep
malt
tones
are
there
but
almost
get
masked
by
the
cloak
of
etoh
this
ones
just
a
little
too
alcoholic
tasting
for
my
likes
small
bottle
but
high
alcohol
content
gotta
give
it
a
try
my
bottle
was
dated
22804
mine
poured
with
a
body
that
was
bronze
but
pushing
towards
golden
and
a
head
that
was
beady
but
very
small
and
quick
to
vanish
the
nose
combined
a
mix
of
a
nice
floral
bouquet
sugar
and
alcohol
i
first
notice
the
full
and
syrupy
aspect
of
the
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
caramel
flavor
with
a
buttery
texture
at
the
transformation
to
the
finish
the
alcohol
level
becomes
much
more
prevalent
its
malty
and
stingingly
strong
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
literally
warm
the
belly
its
amazing
how
such
a
small
package
packs
such
a
punch
good
brew
bottle
said
best
by
oct
02
and
15
abv
poured
in
my
snifter
a
golden
amber
with
off
white
head
with
lots
of
floaties
aroma
alcoholmaltsa
nice
sweetness
like
honey
some
citrus
orange
lemon
licorice
flavor
surprisingly
the
alcohol
was
not
the
1st
thing
that
comes
out
syrupy
fruity
honey
mixtureand
as
it
lingers
in
your
mouth
the
alcohol
comes
out
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
instead
of
cognac
for
a
after
dinner
drink
i
didnt
think
the
french
had
it
in
them
to
make
such
a
beer
that
would
stand
up
and
fight
for
you
attention
first
impression
is
of
a
heavy
weight
in
your
mouth
that
seems
to
dance
across
your
tongue
fine
lively
carbonation
gives
one
the
impression
of
champagne
incredibly
drinkable
alcohol
is
there
but
it
sneaks
in
and
out
of
notice
nose
is
a
delightful
caramel
floral
fresh
cut
tobacco
tawny
port
finish
is
amazing
clove
spicy
continues
on
for
minutes
this
would
be
and
excellent
match
to
food
perhaps
a
pumpkin
flan
apple
tart
with
gruyere
roasted
ham
with
apple
chutney
it
is
fully
15
minutes
from
open
and
the
carbonation
continues
well
portioned
acidity
balances
the
heavy
malt
a
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
lately
sent
as
a
part
of
bif
13
from
hell
by
beeradvocate
drewbage
the
labeling
certainly
fit
the
theme
perfectly
the
orange
yellow
body
looked
very
nice
in
the
pilsner
glass
with
a
two
inch
creamy
head
sitting
atop
it
and
leaving
decent
lace
considering
the
strength
of
the
liquid
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
with
bananas
and
orange
peel
hiding
the
high
abv
very
nicely
the
taste
was
warm
and
soft
with
soothing
liquor
like
quality
to
it
it
was
not
inherently
complex
but
instead
let
the
alcohol
make
things
interesting
with
some
spicy
and
sweet
notes
carried
through
a
little
thin
on
the
palette
and
malt
liquor
like
in
the
sugar
derived
alcohol
strength
although
one
dimensional
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
once
in
a
while
pours
a
very
clear
gold
with
minimal
foam
the
first
sniff
smells
like
glue
yes
glue
further
rousing
of
the
beer
results
in
a
strong
aroma
of
malt
laced
with
a
hint
of
paint
thinner
mmmm
hmmm
paint
thinner
now
im
wondering
if
things
arent
quite
right
with
this
brew
im
undettered
and
i
take
a
sip
which
i
find
to
be
full
of
grainy
flavors
and
alcohol
this
gets
a
little
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
with
some
minerallike
components
and
bit
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
warming
and
the
buzzing
in
my
head
is
kind
of
nice
too
some
of
the
grainy
flavors
remind
me
of
a
scotch
whisky
not
too
bad
after
getting
past
the
offputting
aroma
overall
a
very
potent
brew
that
im
glad
ive
tried
but
not
one
that
i
should
probably
have
too
often
this
is
a
chilled
bottle
sampled
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
and
puts
forth
a
small
bright
white
head
that
fades
to
an
edge
layer
quickly
aroma
is
fruity
with
white
grapes
pears
and
peaches
and
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
too
first
sip
reveals
a
syrupy
texture
small
prickly
carbonation
present
immediately
flavor
is
white
grapes
and
candied
sugar
some
caramel
and
alcohol
that
punches
you
in
the
jaw
the
alcohol
warms
all
the
way
down
to
my
belly
a
definite
sipping
brew
but
i
find
it
enjoyable
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
of
these
little
bottles
though
this
one
comes
in
an
8oz
bottle
with
a
cool
label
on
it
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
high
alcohol
is
also
evident
the
alcohol
is
foremost
in
the
flavor
warming
and
soothing
but
still
somewhat
strong
has
a
strong
flavor
of
caramel
malt
as
well
this
was
a
pretty
good
strong
belgian
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
if
it
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
and
werent
so
expensive
pours
out
a
caramel
brown
into
the
snifter
smell
is
robust
malty
with
almost
a
butterscotch
feel
to
it
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
just
a
little
roastiness
in
there
fairly
nuanced
not
too
sweet
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
at
that
level
13
its
definitely
present
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
decent
brew
but
not
something
that
will
go
into
my
personal
pantheon
of
favorites
its
a
big
one
thats
for
sure
notes
of
melon
pear
lemon
pineapple
and
cooked
corn
not
offensive
in
any
way
it
may
have
been
a
mistake
to
sample
this
beer
after
a
thomas
hardys
1999
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
there
are
just
so
many
better
french
beers
this
was
a
medium
heavy
brew
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
the
finish
was
sharp
alcohol
and
sweetness
not
very
drinkable
as
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
combo
just
didnt
please
the
tastebuds
no
hops
to
balance
this
one
it
skews
too
far
to
the
maltalcohol
extreme
it
is
labled
pur
malt
after
all
france
is
not
known
for
producing
beer
and
i
am
struggling
to
down
this
one
the
initial
appearance
of
this
stuff
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
as
i
am
typically
a
porterstout
kinda
guy
the
smell
is
quite
nice
as
i
am
fond
of
hefeweizen
as
well
the
smell
of
this
stuff
is
kind
of
similar
to
hefe
and
that
trappist
monk
stuff
alot
of
bananas
kind
of
bready
good
bit
of
yeast
i
saw
where
someone
said
it
smelled
like
bacon
i
must
admit
it
does
indeed
have
a
very
very
faint
smell
of
bacon
interesting
the
taste
isnt
awful
in
fact
its
kinda
similar
to
the
trappist
style
mentioned
above
theres
just
something
about
the
taste
i
dont
really
care
for
it
has
a
decent
mouth
feel
thats
a
bit
thick
and
of
course
at
13
0abv
its
pretty
heavy
speaking
of
13abv
this
stuff
does
well
at
masking
its
strength
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
round
and
thick
the
beer
dries
the
palate
but
it
still
light
in
the
mouth
incredibly
and
remarkably
drinkable
for
its
15
a
nice
beer
that
hides
its
power
pretty
well
ideal
before
a
meal
pours
a
light
brown
with
amber
hints
small
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
sweet
malt
light
fruit
hiding
in
background
tastes
of
malt
carmel
and
little
fruit
then
the
alcohol
hits
and
boy
is
it
strong
not
hidden
at
all
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
drinkability
is
terrible
this
beer
not
for
me
if
you
want
alcohhol
taste
get
a
bottle
of
makers
mark
much
smoother
and
tastier
then
this
beer
my
bottle
had
13
on
it
not
15
as
on
site
dated
28
03
05
guessing
its
a
best
buy
date
the
aromas
emerging
from
this
reddish
brasscolored
liquid
are
not
intense
they
are
however
seductive
with
cognac
creme
brulee
and
milk
chocolate
notes
on
the
palate
it
is
even
keeled
with
abundant
burned
sugar
pepper
tobacco
and
spice
flavors
the
texture
is
medium
rather
than
fullbodied
wilting
under
the
glare
of
15
abv
probably
it
is
comparable
to
j
w
lees
harvest
ales
only
less
sweet
and
with
a
bit
more
heat
this
might
be
a
worthwhile
candidate
for
the
cellar
this
one
is
pretty
interesting
and
defies
categorization
closer
to
an
english
strong
old
ale
than
a
pils
lager
or
strong
pale
ale
leave
it
to
the
french
to
mess
your
mind
when
trying
to
figure
this
ale
out
this
one
will
evoke
a
lot
of
controversy
as
differing
palates
try
to
discern
what
this
ale
is
about
had
long
time
kept
this
brew
unpurchased
at
my
local
store
til
one
day
it
jumped
right
out
at
me
so
i
bought
it
at
first
the
reddish
translucid
pour
scarce
headed
seemed
to
have
a
certain
belgian
air
like
bush
or
kwak
the
first
smell
packed
with
malt
wasnt
the
most
appealing
though
and
the
taste
itself
knocked
me
right
out
of
place
excessively
sweet
as
though
trying
to
unsuccessfully
mask
the
13
abv
that
fills
up
your
nostrils
and
mouth
rather
too
much
first
and
last
time
an
interesting
offering
from
brasserie
grain
dorge
obviously
not
a
session
beer
and
as
a
sipper
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
some
of
the
bigger
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
victory
or
dogfish
head
also
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
alcohol
content
belzebuth
seems
like
a
surprisingly
bad
candidate
for
cellaring

i
dont
really
see
any
immature
flavors
that
would
come
out
with
age
since
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
malt
nevertheless
a
fun
beer
to
find
as
a
novelty
but
not
something
im
buying
on
a
regular
basis
if
you
have
a
chance
check
it
out
an
experience
and
an
unusual
style
easy
to
drink
but
one
was
enough
for
a
while
could
i
drink
more
than
1
its
possible
would
i
its
doubtful
an
experience
for
sure
with
this
high
octane
beer
id
bet
the
13
has
some
better
flavors

this

not
for

strong

minimal

noted
mostly
sweet

some
peppery

alcohol
a
decent
desert
beer
or
after
dinner
sipper
a
light
lager
on
crack
this
is
probably
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
the
beer
is
very
warming
and
is
a
unique
taste
but
certainly
nothing
id
drink
everyday
still
might
have
one
again
for
the
novelty
factor
of
it
and
to
try
the
15
version
this
poured
to
an
ambergold
color
with
a
small
bubbled
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
aroma
was
malty
and
alcoholly
with
elements
of
citrus
and
yeast
there
was
a
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
taste
that
definately
warmed
the
belly
carbonation
was
fairly
low
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
chewy
towards
the
finish
sweetness
and
alcohol
were
the
main
components
of
the
finish
this
beer
was
a
bit
like
a
brandy
or
a
cordial
i
liked
the
fact
the
bottles
came
in
a
package
with
two
4
ounce
belzebuth
glasses
13er
pours
an
amberish
golden
color
with
a
spritzy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
alcohol
very
noticable
in
the
nose
some
lighter
fruit
notes
and
husky
grain
and
yeast
too
initially
sweeter
then
moving
towards
a
drier
alcoholladen
finish
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
pretty
winelike
the
french
government
imposed
a
triple
tax
on
beers
belzebuth
was
the
only
french
beer
at
15
and
over
so
the
brewery
revamped
the
recipe
and
rereleased
it
cant
say
i
could
have
these
backtoback
but
a
quality
warmer
anyhow

wow
this
is
a
big

its
amazing
this
beer
pushes
this

not
a
beer
you
would
want
to
dance
with
every
night
though
a
treat
every
once
in
a
while
the
only
problem
was
the
dregs
sneaking
into
the
glass
even
when
i
did
pour
with
care
note
that
this
is
a
filtered
brew
though
there
was
a
little
sediment
oddly
for
a
brew
that
boasts
15

it
has
a

this
is
really
so
much
better
than
many
beers
in
this
style
from
belgium
really
authenticfeeling
really
tasty
really
cool
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
brilliant
beer
from
alesmith
the
quality
really
shows
through
with
this
one
and
it
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
despite
the
fact
it
comes
in
at
11
abv
and
is
packed
with
flavour
its
more
fruity
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
balance
is
great
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
helping
the
beer
down
far
too
easily
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
simply
put
this
one
is
a
must
try
for
any
beer
fan
and
one
that
was
well
worth
the
very
expensive
price
tag
definitely
a
beer
that
has
aged
well
since
i
picked
it
up
a
couple
of
years
ago
the
bottle
suggests
this
be
served
between
50
and
55f
and
it
is
spot
on
too
cold
and
it
was
just
too
clovey
but
as
it
warmed
the
sweetness
came
out
the
banana
was
nice
and
it
has
a
bit
of
bubblegum
but
the
yeasty
fungus
earth
tones
are
not
my
favorite
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
got
better
with
time
and
warming
up
to
room
temperature
too
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
sometime
in
the
future

poured
a

was
way
to
sweet
for
my
taste
in
this
style
my
girlfriend
who
loves
moscato
and
other
sweet
wines
loved
this
serving
type
bottle
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
theres
a
light
aroma
with
a
bit
of
an
estery
aroma
to
it
i
found
it
sweetly
flavored
with
an
orange
blossom
characteristic
shining
through
i
had
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
felt
it
afterwards
o
true
belgian
style
and
quality
o
a
decent
try
at
a
belgian
pale
but
does
not
beat
the
real
thing
brew
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
bubbles
away
quick
nose
is
fairly
fruity
with
big
coriander
notes
and
belgian
candied
yeast
not
a
classic
bspa
but
not
a
huge
departure
just
a
bit
heavy
on
the
sweet
for
the
nose
as
for
the
flavor
the
sweetness
comes
through
but
e
fruitiness
is
more
present
and
balances
things
out
although
this
definitively
falls
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
some
bubble
gum
notes
and
phenolic
booze
on
the
finish
drinks
fairly
nice
and
even
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
at
all

strong

yeast
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
then
an
appropriate
burst
of
coriander
in
the
follow
through
its
so
easy
to
do
overkill
on
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
coriander
but
they
nailed
it
on
this
one
o
a
very
solid
beer
would
love
to
compare
this
one
to
a
more
recent

overall
very
very
good

and
while
there
are
hints
that
this
is
as
boozy

it
is

are

a

offering
o
im
a
fan
of
this
one
o
the
best
american
belgian
style
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
will
try
to
find
another
bottle
my
bottle
says
10
abv
but
nevermind
that
this
has
a
shockingly
pale
look
for
what
i
am
told
is
really
a
barleywine
its
hazy
blonde
with
a
short
frothy
white
head
and
a
nose
of
heavy
coriander
both
fresh
and
seed
as
well
as
bright
belgian
yeast
above
a
wheat
malt
base
accentuated
by
candy
sugar
it
tastes
almost
like
a
tripel
sweet
and
bright
floral
and
yeasty
just
right
the
booze
is
absurdly
well
hidden
the
carbonation
is
awesome
and
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
is
great
my
take
away
is
how
the
hell
can
this
be
so
strong
it
taste
so
minimalist
but
packs
a
big
punch
a
subtly
complex
beer
and
a
very
enjoyable
one
more
summer
than
fall
but
it
ages
well
and
is
drinking
lovely
at
the
moment
alesmith
really
has
it
all
happening
right
now
medium
to
full
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
an
11
abv
beer
another
outstanding
alesmith
beer
ui
will
need
to
pick
some
more
of
this
up
when
i
am
in
hudson
o
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
alesmith
its
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
its
well
worth
the
money
if
youre
into
belgianstyle
ales
this
is
something
you
have
to
try
overall
sweet
with
a
lot
of
spice
coriander
floral
chamomile
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
would
do
the
obvious
and
make
some
sort
of
horny
joke
but
i
just
dont
feel
like
it
tonight
guys
sorry
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
white
bread
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
clove
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
tiny
bit
of
cracked
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
healthy
dose
of
oaked
chardonnay
grapes
this
bit
oertakes
much
of
the
remainder
killing
some
of
the
belgiany
exuberance
especially
due
to
its
clashing
with
the
yeast
and
the
bread
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
airily
drying
finish
overall
this
stuff
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
strong
yeast
just
didnt
jive
with
the
strange
chardonnay
flavor
and
there
was
just
too
much
bread
thropughout
as
well
again
the
ale
is
chocked
full
of
understated
complexity
and
finesse
its
balance
and
layering
is
easily
overlooked
but
are
the
details
that
give
horny
devil
an
authentic
and
genuine
character
o
while
many
american
brewers
struggle
to
replicate
belgian
style
beers
without
coming
off
as
an
american
counterpart
alesmiths
horny
devil
passes
as
the
real
deal
nailing
not
only
the
style
but
the
use
of
a
classic
hardtomaster
yeast
a
solid
belgian
ale
but
it
lacks
a
little
fruitiness
and
dryness
that
would
pep
it
up
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
very
good
spice
and
fruit
flavors
pretty
smooth
for
its
size
and
abv
poured
from
a
750
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
slow
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
sparse
coat
of
white
head
nose
of
tart
and
sweet
tropical
fruit
including
pineapple
mango
and
a
citrus
blend
spices
of
coriander
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
blend
nicely
with
all
the
fruity
characteristics
with
hints
of
belgian
funk
and
booze
highlights
flavors
of
booze
forward
with
a
heavy
dose
of
banana
sweet
and
subtle
spice
blend
to
follow
clove
and
coriander
give
the
beer
a
touch
of
balance
and
there
is
an
overall
warmth
that
builds
as
you
drink
from
the
abv
this
ones
a
heavy
hitter
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
sweet
from
all
the
fruit
character
with
that
warmth
still
kicking
around
your
mouth
smooth
bodied
and
kept
light
by
the
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
spice
linger
very
good
very
heavy
beer
overall
so
much
flavor
packed
in
to
this
beer
that
all
mix
into
a
sublime
belgian
golden
yet
it
is
light
and
bubbly
package
holding
together
a
beautiful
beer
amazed
it
is
10
no
hint
at
all
artfully
crafted
and
beautifully
done
the
flavor
is
sweet
tangy
and
bitter
but
spice
dominates
its
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
high
abv
o
big
big
sweet
bspa
heavy
on
the
sweet
fruits
belgian
yeast
character
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
this
is
definitely
a
very
american
style
bspa
which
honestly
i
typically
prefer
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
authentic
a
duvel
is
probably
more
your
speed
overall
about
as
good
as
any
mediocre
belgian
beer
that
has
been
aged
for
far
too
long
this
cannot
have
been
possibly
older
than
2
years
and
probably
that
is
already
an
overestimation
below
runofthemill
for
a
premium
price
makes
this
beer
seem
almost
like
a
bad
joke
overall
really
nice
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
really
smooth
this
bottle
might
have
a
little
age
on
it
cause
the
alcohol
is
really
mild
and
the
hops
are
very
light
has
great
balance
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
coriander
is
interesting
without
the
usual
accompanying
orange
peel
abv
is
pretty
evident
and
the
malt
is
so
light
yeast
fruit
and
alcohol
driven
it
is
pretty
smooth
despite
all
that
though
and
the
grassy
hops
lend
a
deft
touch
of
bitterness
pretty
good
gets
better
as
it
warms
id
drink
this
again
fo
sho
overall
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
cant
believe
its
11
a
really
great
tasting
beer
taste
can
taste
spices
on
front
buttery
malt
thoughout
very
smooth
and
balances
hides
10
alcohol
very
well
very
good
beer
o
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
for
a
big
fan
of
belgians
too
buttery
doesnt
showcase
the
yeast
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
i
want
very
boozy
and
smooth
so
it
isnt
all
bad
but
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
in
the
most
important
category
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
a
belgian
style
this
is
one
of
the
most
belgian
tasting
beers
i
have
had
from
a
us
brewer
it
does
tend
towards
the
sweet
side
but
that
is
a
minor
complaint
a
really
nice
beer
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
o
not
my
favorite
type
of
brew
but
i
can
tell
this
is
very
well
crafted
34
distinct
flavors
can
be
identified
at
11
and
not
tasting
boozy
im
bumping
up
my
overall
out
of
respect
if
belgian
strongs
are
your
thing
than
give
this
a
whirl
first
ive
had
from
alesmith
thanks
hon
a
great
brew
love
the
style
and
this
is
more
than
worthy
i
would
highly
recommend
this
bspa
a
solid
beer
no
doubt
but
its
hard
to
imagine
ever
drinking
more
than
one
snifter
or
tulip
glass
of
this
o
very
nice
beer
more
sweet
than
most
belgian
pales
but
still
has
some
crisp
bitterness
to
it
ooutstanding
representation
of
the
style
well
crafted
and
delicious
cant
have
too
much
in
one
sitting
though
props
to
alesmith
overall
i
am
impressed
the
smell
was
kind
of
boozy
and
offputting
but
they
pulled
it
off
well
with
the
taste
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
any
releases
that
are
affordable
like
this
m
medium
body
somewhat
creamy
light
carbonation
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
overly
carbonated
however
the
bubbly
nature
makes
this
beer
especially
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
beer
tasted
graet
i
had
cellered
it
for
4
months
after
i
got
it
the
criander
gives
the
beer
and
interesting
spice
quality
that
had
me
coming
back
for
more
drinks
the
yeast
tasted
great
in
this
beer
that
fruit
yeast
character
mixed
with
the
intense
spice
was
superb
pours
beautiful
clear
light
golden
with
small
quickly
receding
head
bubbles
like
champagne
and
they
keep
coming
up
from
the
bottom
smell
of
coriander
honey
apples
and
pears
a
little
funk
fruity
flavor
very
effervescent
flavors
follow
the
smell
exactly
with
some
extra
sweetness
less
dry
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
clean
finish
and
light
mouthfeel
very
nice
i
liked
this
a
lot
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
that
leaves
lacing
haziness
to
the
pour
with
visible
sediment
smells
sweet
with
cherries
and
citrus
fruits
some
alcohol
is
left
on
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
very
malty
with
lots
of
grains
a
sweet
finish
with
the
coriander
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
great
very
delicious
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
rim
of
white
bubbles
aroma
of
coriander
and
belgianness
the
first
sip
takes
me
back
to
the
first
time
i
had
a
big
belgian
beer
and
my
eyes
were
forever
opened
coriander
candi
sugar
lots
of
fruity
esters
and
phenols
backed
up
by
a
creamy
slick
mouthfeel
and
ever
so
slight
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
delicious
t
tasty
well
executed
example
of
the
style
goes
down
remarkably
easily
for
the
abv
i
wouldve
guessed
like
7
overall
a
good
bspa
not
a
standout
but
quite
enjoyable
a
good
but
demanding
one
hard
strong
cheese
recommended
overall
aside
from
the
texture
this
beer
is
a
miss
in
my
book
my
least
favorite
by
a
brewery
whose
beers
i
normally
love
overall
a
good
strong
belgian
style
pale
ale
overspiced
but
pretty
solid
o
not
a
bad
bspa
but
too
sweet
thick
and
simplistic
o
gotta
love
alesmiths
stuff
this
one
warms
nicely
reminded
me
of
a
fuzzy
lemony
tripel
while
it
is
a
good
bspa
it
also
presents
a
palette
of
flavors
that
set
it
apart
from
standards
like
duvel
or
don
de
dieu
definitely
worth
buying
and
trying
split
a
large
bottle
with
a
friend
over
lunch
it
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
in
the
restaurants
little
ortinos
kasteel
glasses
the
slight
alcohol
heat
was
understandable
but
the
beer
was
unusually
acidic
i
was
hoping
for
a
super
duvel
was
more
winelike
with
a
yeasty
spiced
edge
my
friend
was
not
a
fan
but
while
the
flavor
was
a
bit
off
the
mark
little
things
like
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
were
on
and
i
wonder
a
little
if
the
beer
was
mishandled
and
poorly
stored
either
way
this
came
off
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
thats
veered
off
course

looks
very
nice

and
belgian
spicing

moderate
heavy

which
is
nice
considering
how
pale
this
is
complex
fruit
flavors
and
coriander
with
something
happening
through
the
taste
ends
with
a
spicy
peppery

nice
carbonation
bite
overall
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
nice
originally
reviewed
06122011
overall
they
claim
11
abv
and
the
bros
gave
it
stellar
reviews
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
which
might
be
dangerous
i
would
be
lead
to
believe
that
not
all
the
wonderful
belgian
sugar
they
used
in
the
recipe
got
converted
over
to
alcohol
but
who
knows
perhaps
it
did
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
smooth
sweet
strong
beer
or
want
to
get
your
girl
tipsy
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
pale
and
the
huge
abv
is
hidden
remarkably
well
update
as
i
continue
through
the
bottle
i
notice
more
of
a
white
grape
flavor
interesting
o
overall
this
is
a
terrific
beer
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
spicy
flavors
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
happy
to
find
this
on
tap
at
ciros
in
san
diego
o
ive
had
friends
tell
me
to
steer
clear
of
this
one
but
in
my
opinion
this
was
absolutely
fantastic
and
well
worth
the
20
i
spent
d
i
have
never
ever
been
let
down
by
alesmith
they
continually
deliver
with
each
subsequent
beer
i
try
and
this
is
no
exception
a
sipper
with
lots
of
character
an
assertive
and
complex
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
nose
is
world
class
and
all
other
facets
are
beyond
very
good
highly
recommend
nicely
done
appearance
is
nice
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
has
a
nose
of
coriander
belgian
yeast
pear
and
sugar
upon
sipping
it
has
a
taste
of
banana
apple
candy
some
bitterness
it
is
a
sweet
taste
but
not
too
much
so
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
medfull
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
it
alcohol
is
hidden
to
an
extent
so
keep
in
mind
it
is
a
bit
high
even
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
mighty
tasty
beer
pours
a
murky
honey
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
yeast
spices
and
some
slight
citrus
peel
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
the
spices
lingering
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
slight
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slight
crispness
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
good
american
example
of
the
style
almost
a
champagne
like
lookaromataste
to
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
kinda
fruity
smell
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
abv
doesnt
really
knock
your
socks
off
with
taste
though
but
has
a
smooth
finish
and
dry
aftertaste
making
it
mostly
drinkable
good
beer
but
wouldnt
call
it
that
great
or
amazing
in
my
opinion
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
overall
nothing
that
gave
me
a
comeback
moment
i
wanted
to
try
it
but
didnt
have
high
expectations
going
into
it
i
would
tell
my
past
self
to
go
for
a
different
beer
instead
of
this
one
a
the
aroma
has
a
fresh
and
slightly
fruity
smell
that
hints
at
the
actual
taste
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
and
a
very
dry
aftertaste
i
would
be
interested
in
aging
this
at
some
point
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
me
at
a
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
clove
spice
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
alcohol
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
this
one
was
all
over
the
place
with
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
itself
known
throughout
the
entire
brew
despite
this
fact
it
was
really
well
balanced
but
the
alcohol
hurts
the
drinkability
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
around
poured
from
bomber
into
tulip
glass
pours
clear
golden
with
a
massive
rocky
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
an
even
layer
of
lace
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
residue
along
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
super
fruity
with
pear
white
grape
candi
sugar
and
spices
along
with
some
fairly
light
hay
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
the
candi
sugar
and
pear
and
grape
juice
showing
nicely
along
with
the
spices
and
hay
malt
just
lightly
peaking
through
the
body
is
medium
with
lively
mouthfilling
carbonation
a
pretty
good
offering
from
alesmith
for
the
style
nose
is
super
complex
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
there
is
just
so
much
nuance
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
dont
for
a
minute
regret
holding
on
to
it
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
when
i
purchased
the
brew
i
paid
11
99
at
a
super
place
in
orange
california
called
hollingsheads
delicatessen
i
look
forward
to
going
back
and
when
i
do
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
fine
belgian
from
southern
california
o
a
good
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
which
was
basically
a
duvel
clone
very
fruity
and
pretty
unique
87100
o
overall
im
sure
it
is
an
excellent
beer
if
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
your
into
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
i
took
one
sip
at
the
alesmith
brewery
and
i
told
my
fiance
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
unbelievable
medium
bodied
with
sharp
tight
carbonation
and
a
prominent
coriander
spiciness
that
dominates
the
flavor
lingering
over
the
grassy
yeast
and
light
fruit
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
boozy
finish
the
carbonation
and
strong
spice
presence
makes
this
beer
a
bit
harsh
and
difficult
to
drink
as
it
warms
and
the
palate
adjusts
the
grassy
hops
bready
yeast
and
fruit
notes
become
more
evident
hints
of
apple
pear
and
candy
sugar
add
sweetness
but
the
spice
is
too
strong
for
my
liking
finishes
with
a
lot
of
boozy
sweetness
and
warmth
in
the
chest
abv
not
very
well
masked
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
rare
miss
from
alesmith
overall
a
good
beer
lots
of
good
belgian
qualities
but
nothing
i
was
overly
excited
about
overall
a
great
stab
at
the
style
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
with
the
onslaught
of
candi
suga
and
the
mountain
of
alcohol
in
the
end
would
probably
go
great
with
some
pasta
dish
shared
with
friends
overall
a
complex
and
enjoyable
belgian
strong
pale
good
belgian
style
i
cant
help
but
be
heavily
reminded
of
unibroue
really
impressed
with
this
alesmith
offering
a
very
good
american
bspa
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
perpetual
1
finger
head
aroma
of
orange
peel
coriander
and
juicy
pears
taste
follows
the
nose
but
is
a
bit
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
not
a
bad
brew
just
too
sweet
and
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
overall
i
think
this
did
not
travel
well
from
california
i
am
thinking
bottle
shock
but
could
be
wrong
it
is
really
too
bad
but
judging
from
other
appearance
reviews
of
this
it
looks
like
something
went
wrong
too
bad
there
is
a
tremendous
beer
behind
this
just
wanting
to
escape
i
will
have
to
have
this
sometime
again
luckily
even
in
this
state
there
is
very
much
to
enjoy
it
looks
like
this
all
had
to
do
with
the
pour
somewhat
but
you
never
know
a
fantastic
beer
is
hiding
here
o
i
dont
know
why
but
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
in
this
beer
it
was
really
tasty
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
different
then
any
other
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
and
ill
probably
pick
up
more
bottles
in
the
future
very
complex
drink
indeed
finish
is
soso
with
lots
of
warming
alcohol
flavors
are
ok
but
not
the
most
complex
beer
and
it
definitely
shows
its
abv
all
the
way
through
o
good
beer
overall
but
knocked
down
a
bit
due
to
etoh
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
and
the
varied
yet
balanced
flavoring
works
well
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
looking
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
big
and
fluffy
leaving
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
an
interesting
soft
fruity
aroma
to
it
the
smell
of
belgian
yeast
and
some
wild
flowers
are
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
floral
with
a
little
hop
bite
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
tickled
the
taste
buds
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
overall
and
its
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
o
the
strength
of
this
one
really
crept
up
on
me
its
probably
too
much
beer
for
one
person
to
enjoy
due
to
the
strength
but
i
did
it
id
buy
this
again
if
it
were
on
the
shelf
around
here
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
a
classic
belgian
style
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
outstanding
even
though
11
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
love
it
overall
a
very
good
and
well
made
belgain
pale
ale
probably
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
flawed
were
not
talking
world
class
material
here
but
really
good
o
pretty
good
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
something
i
probably
wont
revisit
tastes
are
wheat
fields
sweat
booze
coriander
grass
lemons
lemonade
yeast
wood
bananas
cloves
mint
ginger
and
biscuits
smells
like
a
lot
good
going
on
all
at
once
ive
been
drinking
this
since
2009
and
so
on
and
so
fourth
im
glad
i
tried
this
so
early
on
drink
a
nice
gift
from
the
wife
for
my
birthday
for
something
different
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
but
was
nice
to
break
away
from
gigantic
stouts
ipas
and
dipas
d
very
good
unique
in
comparison
to
most
strong
ales
and
complex
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
goodness
drops
into
the
glass
a
fine
white
head
sits
atop
a
pretty
little
thing
perfumy
with
some
coriander
hints
strong
fusel
alcohols
gettin
diesel
on
it
needs
some
time
to
settle
in
the
bottle
it
tastes
of
its
strength
the
alcohol
kick
is
huge
a
little
citrusy
definite
esters
kicking
up
a
storm
bit
of
coriander
yes
this
would
definitely
benefit
from
a
little
age
as
the
flavors
are
duking
it
out
currently
lots
of
flavors
going
on
but
the
alcohol
burn
that
accompanies
each
sip
is
a
bit
distracting
still
it
is
tasty
and
im
excited
to
try
one
with
a
little
bit
of
age
on
it

after
a
good
jam
small

extremely
quickly

the

shines
through
some

alcoholic
burn
and
an
acrid
yeast
quickly
gets
the
warmth
effect
and
takes
on
a
life
of
its
own
weird
because
it
starts
off
not
that
good
but
as
it
warms
it
begins
to
harmonize
and
eventually
gets
round
and
playful
it
takes
a
talented
brewmaster
to
deliver

in
an

this
one
takes
the
cake
in
the

of
the

i
believe
they
may
need
to
tweak
the
name
on
this
one
as
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
much
of

d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
belgian
style
beer
with
lots
of
belgian
sytle
yeast
and
spices
mixing
with
apples
would
like
to
have
again
nice
drinkability
wish
i
had
bought
two
750s
tonight
the
pour
yields
a
bright
golden
brew
with
a
really
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
and
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
grain
and
bread
the
fruit
character
is
quite
prominent
in
the
nose
some
light
tropical
fruits
with
a
bit
of
cherry
and
melon
light
pear
and
spice
as
well
the
taste
follows
up
on
this
everything
is
a
bit
light
and
not
all
of
the
fruity
components
combine
all
that
well
feel
is
crisp
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
pretty
good
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
with
better
belgian
varieties
much
more
widelyavailable
drinkability
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
alesmith
and
a
fruitier
take
on
the
style
strong
beligian
smell
you
know
that

robust

yellow
thin

lacing
small
head
tastes
like
a
belgiansweet
strongbut
not
as
strong
as
some
i
have
tried
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
pale
also
not
my
favorite
but
overall
if
you
like
this
style
of
beer
you
will
probably
like
it
as
another
reviewer
wrote
you
get
a
fruit
loop
aromayet
its
not
overly
sweet
first
sip
is
pineapple
lifesavers
and
then
that
belgian
yeast
each
sip
after
brings
out
more
bright
fruits
its
as
if
someone
made
a
fruity
sparkling
version
of
duvel
its
delicious
the
bubbles
keep
on
coming
making
it
jump
in
your
mouth
the
alchohol
is
very
well
hidden
watch
out
an
exceptional
take
on
this
style
overall
a
great
complex
belgian
strong
ale
this
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
drinkability
really
quite
a
wellcrafted
beer
as
is
everything
alesmith
seems
to
do
however
due
to
the
heavier
abv
and
its
continued
presence
as
i
plow
my
way
through
the
bottle
it
becomes
tougher
to
finish
crack
this
one
with
friends
on
a
special
occasion
or
simply
make
a
special
occasion
by
cracking
this
one
with
friends
either
way
the
operative
notion
is
to
share
it
with
friends
pours
a
pretty
nice
healthy
amber
with
a
prominent
foamy
head
and
thick
lacing
this
is
a
very
thick
beer
the
color
is
rich
and
unwavering
smells
like
a
warm
piece
of
buttered
toast
that
has
been
chilled
and
liquefied
taste
is
very
bready
almost
like
a
good
san
francisco
sourdough
but
without
the
crunchy
crust
and
moist
buttery
inside
feels
decent
in
the
mouth
not
to
excited
about
finishing

giant

poured
a
golden
orange
in
color
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
some
bubbly

sticking
to

the
aroma
definitely
had
the
belgian
yeast
character
alongisde
orange
citrus
slight
coriander
with
faint
brown
suagr
and
booze
notes
the
citrus
orange
was
more
apparent
on
the
taste
but
still
had
the
belgian
yeast
character
with
coriander
earthy
and
brown
sugar
accents
ending
with
a
touch
of
booze
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
citrusy
yeasty
slight
spice
and
fruity
finish
it
drank
real
good
and
has
been
a
soild
interpretation
of
a
bspa
everytime
ive
had
it
another
good
offering
from
the
peeps
at
alesmith
d
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
good
looking
and
great
tastearoma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
drinkability
is
good
it
had
a
lot
of
great
flavors
to
it
and
some
nice
complexity
it
really
integrated
the
candi
sugar
and
the
coriander
well
i
definitely
thought
it
tasted
a
lot
like
some
of
the
sweeter
white
wines
ive
had
and
can
easily
see
any
wine
drinker
liking
this
beer
very
good
beer
overall
pours
a
crisp
golden

color
with
a
big
rockyfluffy
white
head
aromas
of
coriander
belgian
yeast
pink
peppercorns
and
tart
green
apples
on
the
palate
this
one
is
very
refreshing
crisp
and
light
bodied
flavors
of
honey
belgian
candi
sugar
alcohol
and
apples
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
buy
again
md
very
stick
feel
with
high
carbonation
sweetness
is
a
touch
overwhelming
but
it
certainly
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
flavor
is
fantastic
i
dont
why
i
expected
a
bit
hoppier
of
a
beer
but
this
is
mellow
and
delicious
lots
of
sweet
smelling
citrus
fruit
orange
peel
coriander
wheat
mildly
funky
big
carbonation
light
crisp
mouthfeel
biggest
compliment
i
can
say
though
is
this
is
a
great
drinker
everything
about
the
consistency
and
flavor
makes
this
beer
extremely
palitable
great
beer
from
alesmith
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
great
i
get
a
lot
of
coriander
oranges
white
pepper
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
alcohol
it
is
quite
boozy
belgian
yeast
coriander
wheat
and
orange
juice
this
tastes
like
a
belgian
white
on
steroids
but
it
is
not
a
coriander
bomb
like
a
lot
of
the
double
whites
i
have
tried
in
the
past
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
md
medium
body
but
heavy
in
the
carbonation
you
could
see
this
once
poured
into
the
glass
i
liked
the
forfront
of
this
beer
it
was
a
little
to
boozyspicy
for
me
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
though
and
really
drink
it
slow
it
took
me
half
an
hour
to
sip
my
half
maybe
an
hours
worth
is
in
order
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
is
high
as
every
sip
makes
me
want
another
but
when
i
do
i
am
reminded
about
the
heavy
duty
spice
in
there
750
bottle
my
first
alesmith
pours
a
hazy
golden
large
3
finger
head
medium
to
high
carbonation
yeasty
coriander
is
dominant
some
fruit
alcohol
is
present
some
candided
sugar
not
a
bad
beer
i
like
this
one
however
i
believe
ive
had
better
for
this
style
d
very
nice
and
delicious
a
well
spiced
bspa
with
a
great
abv
content
hehe
and
crisp
and
clean
carbonation
d
the
booze
is
a
little
strong
in
this
one
after
a
few
sips
other
than
this
slightly
overwhelming
factor
the
flavors
are
solid
would
be
very
interesting
to
see
how
this
ages
d
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
you
can
get
for
a
beer
with
this
abv
the
alcohol
goes
completely
unnoticed
and
has
a
very
good
taste
making
this
one
easy
to
drink
way
to
quick
worth
getting
to
try
nice
american
bspa
also
i
love
the
bottle
m
a
really
heavy
strike
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
after
a
few
seconds
on
the
mouth
mf
and
drinkability
were
excellent
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
well
maybe
not
all
night
since
its
11
but
this
brew
hid
the
11
well
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
diminishes
quite
quickly
scent
is
very
floral
and
lots
of
coriander
belgian
yeast
scents
as
well
the
taste
is
very
much
like
it
smells
except
with
a
little
more
hops
tons
of
coriander
and
spices
with
a
lot
of
flower
tastes
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
too
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
is
hidden
extremely
well
when
cold
i
love
the
mouthfeel
as
it
seems
perfect
for
this
style
i
expected
it
to
be
way
more
syrupy
the
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
high
for
this
being
11
dthis
beer
hides
its
11abv
very
well
great
belgiany
flavor
and
malt
sweetness
with
enough
carbonation

keep
you
coming

d
good
beer
that
could
be
a
great
beer
if
the
bitterness
was
upped
a
bit
flavorful
and
tasty
making
for
good
drinkability
but
since
i
got
more
from
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
it
feels
like
the
carbonation
may
be
holding
back
the
potentially
wonderful
flavors
here
db
price
not
bad
depending
on
where
you
get
it
for
a
big
bottle
definitely
something
to
share
with
a
friend
better
than
some
of
the
authentic
belgian
ales
i
have
had
worth
a
shot
from
a
consistently
good
brewery
glad
i
split
this
one
flavors
are
good
but
really
intense
and
strong
15
is
a
bit
crazy
as
well
jd
i
paid
13
dollars
well
wife
did
for
a
birthday
gift
for
a
750
ml
bottle
i
would
say
that
if
you
have
never
tried
it
before
its
worth
the
money
for
a
new
experience
but
as
a
repeat
purchase
i
dont
think
i
would
spend
the
money
afterall
13
bucks
for
a
bottle
of
beer
is
very
ambitious
d
goes
down
well
enough
but
ive
kill
my
palate
on
these
beers
in
the
past
few
years
because
they
all
taste
the
same
real
good
price
and
pour
perfumey
taste
full
bodied
for
style
coriander
and
sweet
great
beer
this
was
the
last
of
the
alesmith
beers
sold
commercially
i
hadnt
had
recommended
caramel
malts
and
bready
toasted
grain
flavors
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
one
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
it
too
often
though
getting
through
a
bottle
by
myself
was
an
undertaking
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
luxurious
great
carbonation
and
a
midbody
o
fun
to
try
its
a
good
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
very
easy
to
drink
frankly
this
is
too
sweet
to
be
truly
drinkable
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
to
be
honest
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
oh
well
live
and
learn
another
fantastic
alesmith
brew
horny
devil
substantially
exceeded
my
expectations
this
is
a
fascinatingly
deep
beer
but
its
so
easy
to
drink
that
i
had
to
consciously
slow
down
to
enjoy
it
ill
be
seeking
this
out
and
looking
forward
to
the
next
time
im
able
to
taste
it
quite
reminiscent
of
a
champagne
cocktail
d
a
good
brew
to
split
a
few
ways
while
it
was
good
it
was
not
among
my
favorite
bspa
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
fruit
yeast
and
peppery
spice
however
the
aroma
didnt
do
justice
to
the
taste
fruit
cotton
candy
funky
yeast
spice
pepper
although
its
11
abv
you
wouldnt
notice
it
very
smooth
and
lively
need
to
have
more
of
these
creamy
and
luscious
body
and
wonderful
layered
complex
flavors
pale
malts
lead
into
corainder
and
tropical
fruits
with
a
yeasty
belgian
spice
induced
finish
that
lasts
into
a
tingly
carbonation
with
some
hop
bitterness
pineapple
starfruit
mango
and
papaya
flavors
some
alcohol
in
the
mouth
and
finish
but
not
bothersome
very
nice
pours

pillowy

head
that
fades
slowly
to

acton
ma
drinkability
decent
for
the
style
but
not
spectacular
it
feels
like
an
enhanced
version
of
the
style
this
one
is
complex
but
not
one
i
am
likely
to
get
again
d
pretty
good
but
overall
not
my
style
of
beer
notes
this
is
the
5th
consecutive
alesmith
beer
that
i
have
rated
this
one
is
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
alesmith
clearly
a
great
brewery
damn
appearance
is
a
bit
lacking
appears
fizzy
with
smallish
head
though
a
nice
straw
gold
color
smell
is
a
bit
tame
but
definitely
good
some
bready
malts
maybe
a
bit
of
funk
some
citric
sweetness
apples
taste
is
definitely
a
punch
of
citrus
apples
pears
and
some
cloveyeastiness
delicious
mf
is
clean
though
a
bit
thin
the
carbonation
is
fizzy
not
fluffy
superb
drink
one
that
i
was
lucky
to
try
had
no
idea
that
this
was
11
maybe
would
have
pinned
it
as
7
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
really
drinkable
a
small
glass
will
take
a
while
to
savor
and
during
that
time
the
true
amazing
flavors
come
out
this
was
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
great
beer

a
really
great
representation
of
the
style
with
an
exquisite
balance
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
to
date
and
probably
my
favorite
domestic
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
a
world
class
effort
from
alesmith
alesmith
is
a
brewery
that
has
a
fantastic
roster
of
beers
im
yet
to
encounter
a
bad
one
horny
devil
is
an
impressive
bspa
alesmith
did
a
wonderful
job
featuring
belgian
yeast
its
the
highlight
here
and
steals
the
show
a
little
more
strength
on
the
nose
would
help
in
addition
to
a
prominent
spicy
flavor
its
good
but
could
be
grand
more
bubbles
would
be
a
good
thing
as
well
nonetheless
im
still
impressed
with
horny
devil
while
i
dont
believe
it
has
any
effect
on
my
prurient
nature
it
certainly
appeases
my
beerloving
character
drinkability
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
about
this
one
it
was
good
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
this
is
one
to
keep
on
hand
if
you
have
a
cellar
this
is
delicious
smooth
strong
and
surprisingly
drinkable
overallnotes
this
was
a
christmas
gift
and
a
real
good
one
at
that
i
love
belgianstyle
beers
and
this
is
one
keeps
me
in
line
the
second
glass
was
better
than
the
first
probably
because
it
was
warmer
tasty
stuff
i
hope
to
meet
this
beer
once
more
in
the
near
future
draught
at
the
red
hazy
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
sweet
aroma
plenty
of
fruity
notes
with
banana
domination
some
spicing
and
light
tartness
the
flavor
has
that
same
fruity
sweetness
with
some
orangebanana
and
a
spicy
and
alcoholic
wrapup
a
lemony
tangy
citrus
flavor
come
in
a
bit
later
the
sugar
lightens
the
body
to
a
medium
clip
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
grand
cru
and
with
very
creamy
tight
carbonation
for
11
this
is
insanely
easy
to
put
down
the
bananaspice
flavors
and
creamy
texture
make
me
think
of
a
belgian
palestrong
crossed
with
a
german
hef
definitely
the
preferred
of
their
big
belgian
styled
offerings
a
this
point
overall
a
strong
bspa
that
i
highly
recommend
i
really
enjoy
it
asis
but
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
develops
yet
another
great
alesmith
offering
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
so
shipped
to
myself
if
here
couple
a
year
which
is
alot
since
mostly
trying
new
beers
this
year
will
get
a
couple
for
cellaring
d
pretty
good
this
is
a
seasonal
so
its
only
around
in
oct
nov
i
like
it
myself
as
its
a
good
belgian
with
solid
hop
profile
as
well
this
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
a
belgian
style
ale
if
you
like
belgian
beers
this
one
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
good
for
what
this
beer
is
an
11
abv
spiced
belgian
strong
ale
overall
another
great
one
from
alesmith
peter
zien
just
kills
it
every
time
its
almost
ridiculous
poured
into
a
tulip
this
beer
produced
a
nice
orange
haze
with
a
3
finger
white
head
it
smells
of
citrus
and
lemon
the
taste
is
pretty
complex
at
first
you
get
the
lemon
presence
and
then
it
melds
into
the
malt
and
sugar
to
form
a
nice
crisp
finish
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
this
type
of
beer
i
could
not
detect
any
alcohol
while
drinking
this
so
be
weary
when
you
open
one
by
yourself
i
could
see
this
one
aging
wonderfully
if
kept
in
the
right
conditions
wonderful
beer
and
highly
recommended
d
very
good
unique
in
comparison
to
most
strong
ales
and
complex
great
beer
but
at
11
its
a
slow
sipper
a
capped
red
foil
wrapped
750ml
bottle
i
picked
this
up
in
ohio
just
about
a
year
ago
so
its
at
least
that
old
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
oerbier
tulip
glass
appears
a
cloudy
bright
golden
apricot
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fizzy
quickly
fading
white
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
coriander
candi
sugar
spicy
yeast
black
pepper
orange
peel
bread
syrupy
medium
body
with
lively
carbonation
still
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
less
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
one
to
sip
on
nice
balance
and
taste
alcohol
very
wellcovered
for
11
abv
d
alcohol
remains
wellconcealed
in
this
strong
ale
which
bolsters
its
drinkability
sure
its
a
sipper
but
its
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
alesmith
but
its
a
tribute
to
their
beer
that
its
still
head
and
shoulders
better
than
most
beers
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
for
me
and
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
the
fruity
sweetness
gets
a
little
much
after
a
while
still
very
good
excellent
belgian
with
a
complex
wellmelded
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
thick
rich
head
theres
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
excellent
i
was
surprised
to
find
authentic
excellent
belgian
ale
aromas
and
flavor
the
aroma
is
mostly
spice
cloves
and
coriander
seed
the
flavor
is
a
strong
kick
of
candied
apricot
and
sweet
caramel
its
earthy
and
more
complex
than
the
majority
of
american
made
belgianstyle
ales
its
accessible
and
very
easy
to
like
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
is
barely
felt
except
as
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
the
sweetness
is
delicious
and
never
overbearing
its
an
excellent
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
reasonable
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
skin
the
aroma
is
mildly
citrusy
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
with
tons
of
carbonation
in
most
bspdas
which
i
think
improves
the
taste
there
was
a
bit
of
sour
in
the
taste
too
feel
was
crisp
clean
and
light
bodied
drinkability
was
good
the
11
0
abv
was
well
hidden
imo
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
ive
had
d
this
stuff
is
really
good
but
its
very
strong
so
i
have
to
take
away
a
little
on
drinkability
one
large
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
me
a
light
breakfastsyrupy
feel
though
a
bit
thin
and
with
medium
high
carbonation
doubtless
as
the
bottle
says
this
beer
would
age
quite
well
and
improve
with
it
i
suppose
its
time
to
run
away
from
here
i
neednt
be
eating
fruit
loops
in
the
devils
den
with
his
wife
any
longer
though
i
will
put
it
back
on
my
wants
overall
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
alesmith
certainly
worth
a
shot
aged
as
recommended
for
about
a
year
peachy
colour
looks
elegant
smells
yeasty
and
malty
above
average
mouthfeel
that
is
cuveeish
dry
rich
and
the
alcohol
hits
you
later
corriander
and
fruit
white
pepper
a
very
good
belgium
for
a
lighter
colour
2008
vintage
pours
honey
golden
with
nice
clarity
and
initially
a
thick
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
lacing
is
soapy
nose
black
and
white
pepper
oranges
candi
sugar
and
slightly
musty
taste
the
pale
malt
adds
a
certain
breadiness
followed
by
citrus
and
spice
sweetness
from
the
candi
sugar
comes
through
on
the
back
end
and
helps
the
brew
finish
quite
dry
and
a
little
hot
abv
is
relatively
hidden
as
drinkability
is
dangerous
carbonation
is
moderate
body
fairly
light
what
an
outstanding
beer
as
im
a
newbie
to
the
west
coast
i
am
truly
impressed
by
alesmiths
effort
here
i
heard
the
hype
walking
into
this
tasting
so
the
bar
was
high
well
played
skip
probably
tod
first
thing
to
hit
ya
is
the
wonderful
aroma
yeast
and
a
slight
honey
sweetness
pours
a
light
murky
creek
river
tan
the
ole
miss
the
ole
man
has
a
wonderful
all
around
feel
from
the
uplifting
yeasty
aroma
to
the
absolute
clean
cut
mouthfeel
roll
em
up
very
easy
to
drink
a
sipper
with
loads
of
complex
fun
flavours
peach
mango
yeast
honey
plum
tits
pineapple
are
just
some
of
the
flavours
thank
goodness
koth
is
getting
canceled
the
alcohol
level
is
absolutely
perfect
works
well
a
fantastic
well
made
enjoyable
empowering
manly
yet
could
be
enjoyed
by
any
one
kinda
person
flavourful
kinda
brew
another
winner
by
alesmith
but
be
careful
packs
a
huge
secret
punch
this
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
and
wild
yeast
and
salt
with
sweet
caramel
and
powdered
sugar
it
tasted
like
lots
of
wild
yeast
and
creamy
lemon
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
sugary
cake
and
alcohol
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
smooth
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
beer
with
nice
flavor
and
great
body
the
coriander
really
helped
the
lemon
hops
mesh
with
the
wild
yeast
that
along
with
excellent
belgian
candi
sugar
resulted
in
an
exceptionally
balanced
flavor
better
for
sipping
since
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
age
would
probably
help
mellow
this
beer
some
and
further
enhance
the
malty
goodness
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
fresh
poured
from
a
750ml
into
tulip
had
a
cloudy
yellowish
tiny
head
that
disappears
very
fast
scent
of
coriander
apple
tarts
yeasty
and
notes
of
floral
taste
was
amazing
that
had
caramel
and
alcohol
in
your
face
and
bright
apples
and
peaches
in
the
back
massive
carbonation
and
the
yeast
are
very
alive
overall
its
easy
to
come
by
in
so
cal
at
least
and
reasonably
priced
it
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
anywhere
in
m
opinion
the
body
as
usual
is
spot
on
nice
and
full
a
little
syrupy
but
even
at
room
temperature
not
really
when
alesmith
says
serve
at
55
degress
goddamn
it
im
serving
at
55
degrees
the
gentlemen
know
what
theyre
doing
and
ive
enjoyed
every
ride
ive
been
on
so
far
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
colored
body
with
a
creamy
white
color
head
good
lacing
but
diminishing
smells
very
fruity
lots
of
fruit
fruit
loops
comes
to
mind
alcohol
and
belgian
flowery
aroma
some
spiciness
and
i
think
the
coriander
too
some
mustiness
sweet
taste
some
honey
like
some
spiciness
not
as
good
tasting
as
it
smells
maybe
its
the
coriander
or
something
a
little
too
strong
a
little
mediciny
d
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
wont
be
having
it
again
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
color
with
plenty
of
yeast
floaters
smallish
offwhite
head
that
left
a
small
ring
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
honey
suckle
mixed
with
a
strong
coriander
aroma
the
coriander
is
a
bit
overpowering
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
honey
floral
some
orange
peel
and
lemon
and
lots
and
lots
of
coriander
if
you
like
coriander
you
will
love
this
brew
the
feel
is
fairly
light
with
prickly
carbonation
finishes
sweet
but
not
sticky
a
well
made
bspa
for
sure
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
excess
coriander
flavor
i
just
cracked
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
stuff
for
my
dad
a
few
minutes
ago
and
poured
myself
a
little
realized
i
had
not
reviewed
yet
although
it
is
probably
my
fifth
encounter
with
this
brew
have
had
a
2000
and
2002
vintage
in
the
past
as
well
this
particular
one
would
be
either
a
late
2007
or
early
2008
bottle
poured
into
my
small
three
philosophers
glass
color
is
a
medium
orange
with
some
amber
red
mixed
in
there
as
well
34
inch
slightly
creamy
white
head
decent
retention
some
lacing
at
first
aroma
is
pears
coriander
booze
sweet
yeast
mild
hoppiness
plums
esters
berries
sugar
and
toffee
flavor
starts
off
subtle
then
gets
aggressive
pretty
fast
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
trappist
brew
of
this
style
and
i
think
that
is
what
alesmith
was
going
for
with
this
one
in
the
first
place
each
sip
has
something
different
it
seems
like
more
fruit
as
it
warms
also
hotness
from
the
alchol
like
the
spice
and
peaches
in
the
finish
by
the
end
missed
both
of
those
in
the
smell
pretty
much
but
they
add
a
nice
change
later
on
mouthfeel
is
sweet
spicy
hot
and
fruity
thin
to
medium
bodied
lighter
carbonation
and
on
the
verge
of
being
a
bit
syrupy
not
a
bad
thing
here
though
makes
the
beer
more
full
and
enjoyable
like
how
the
taste
lingers
could
probably
drink
a
whole
big
bottle
of
this
alcohol
is
not
hidden
great
but
it
more
enhances
the
brew
than
makes
it
strong
and
overbearing
smooth
and
warms
up
nicely
another
quality
brew
from
alesmith
glad
i
can
walk
into
a
local
store
and
buy
whenever
i
am
in
the
mood
for
one
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
would
make
for
an
interesting
brew
hint
hint
peter
will
be
drinking
again
this
baby
ages
well
and
tastes
good
fresh
recommended
d
easy
to
drink
but
there
needs
to
be
more
carbination
drinkability
as
always
an
outstanding
job
by
the
good
people
over
at
alesmith
in
fact
i
dont
recall
ever
having
a
brew
from
them
that
i
havent
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
great

juice
for
me
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
pretty
good
theres
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
there
and
tons
of
fruity
character
lending
a
gentle
sweetness
yet
it
all
seems
to
come
together
id
be
curious
to
see
how
time
would
change
this
one
might
have
to
find
another
and
stash
it
in
the
cellar
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
mine
actually
had
almost
no
head
on
it
at
all
there
was
no
pop
when
i
opened
it
either
very
nice
aroma
banana
cloves
wheat
spices
sweetness
and
a
few
others
very
nice
taste
slight
notes
of
the
bananas
coriander
yeast
breadiness
other
spices
and
fruits
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
flavor
is
initially
very
fruity
again
reminds
me
of
stone
fruit
only
more
like
canned
peaches
this
time
with
a
hint
of
pears
very
mild
corriander
spice
and
good
but
not
over
the
top
carbonation
finishes
clean
but
fruity
drinkability
is
very
high
as
all
the
flavors
are
mild
enough
to
keep
an
otherwise
big
beer
light
and
happy
any
hop
presense
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
is
minimal
enough
not
to
be
terribly
noticable
but
the
bitterness
levels
are
nicely
balanced
pours
darker
gold
with
a
shortlived
bubbly
head
aroma
full
of
yeast
bread
apples
and
coriander
very
smooth
motuhfeel
and
taste
nice
balance
between
the
candi
sugar
and
fruity
tartness
trippellike
yeastiness
with
more
of
an
alcoholic
back
very
enjoyable
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
fat
longlasting
white
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
spicy
with
the
coriander
showing
but
also
some
yeast
on
top
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
that
are
light
but
apparent
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
lively
on
the
palate
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
as
is
the
finish
i
found
this
to
be
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
overall
a
very
nice
brew
very
good
beer
the
body
is
moderate
surprising
considering
the
abv
some
astringency
from
the
spice
carbonation
is
low
for
style
overall
i
think
if
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
crisp
and
backs
off
on
some
of
the
spices
it
could
really
be
a
winner
but
eh
notes
from
6308
poured
into
a
chalice
this
beer
looks
like
a
solid
bar
of
gold
in
the
glass
big
bubbly
head
on
top
crashes
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
froth
the
aroma
is
big
on
coriandar
belgian
sugar
and
candied
apricots
noted
as
well
ok
here
it
goes
thick
and
quite
syrupy
on
the
palate
with
a
little
alcohol
the
latter
most
noted
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
wow
this
is
very
potent
stuff
the
coriandar
is
big
in
this
beer
and
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
plays
second
fiddle
very
spiced
almost
overbearing
its
fine
on
its
own
but
a
pairing
with
food
would
make
this
brew
more
drinkable
very
well
done
and
certainly
well
deserving
a
few
extra
touches
and
could
challenge
the
best
belgian
versions
i
have
never
handed
a
beer
back
to
a
waitress
before
but
there
is
always
a
first
for
everything
i
had
been
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
but
the
coriander
was
simply
too
much
for
me
da
bit
to
spicy
and
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
fully
i
can
appreciate
what
is
being
with
this
one
though
certainly
one
to
be
shared
and
enjoyed
over
a
long
session
a
firesdie
sipper
this
beer
is
spicy
as
hell
and
i
think
the
spicing
detracts
just
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
nevertheless
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
sitting
back
and
relaxing
over
dinner
and
a
long
evening
d
i
found
this
brew
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
the
bold
taste
drinkability
fairly
high
i
have
drank
this
beer
before
in
years
past
but
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
as
well
as
it
does
right
now
this
has
great
taste
and
balances
11
yes
11
alcohol
with
great
light
spicy
flavor
750ml
bottle
with
a
red
foil
wrapping
pourd
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
orangish
color
with
a
large
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
forever
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
bottle
designs
it
looks
extremely
sinister
for
a
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
some
fruit
apples
and
pears
coriander
and
other
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
features
some
fruit
like
in
the
nose
and
some
spices
with
some
warming
in
the
finish
from
the
high
abv
this
one
tastes
like
a
spiced
tripel
overall
horny
devil
is
another
solid
beer
from
alesmith
that
is
recommended
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
so
this
is
a
bit
hard
to
drink
top
notch
if
i
were
rating
it
as
a
beer
judge
but
i
wont
often
return
to
it
drinkability
on
this
strong
brew
is
really
high
when
sampled
out
of
keg
at
the
brewery
had
never
tried
one
of
these
brews
from
some
reason
ive
been
making
a
mistake
a
wonderful
beer
great
nose
of
some
citrus
oil
hops
and
pine
zest
a
balance
and
a
long
finish
looking
forward
to
trying
this
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
now
on
tap
this
was
maybe
the
best
belgium
stong
beer
ive
had
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
not
sure
what
was
up
with
the
look
of
it
but
it
did
not
detract
from
the
overall
experience
at
all
i
thought
this
was
a
classic
ale
for
alesmith
and
something
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
will
have
to
try
this
one
on
tap
one
day
as
it
seems
to
be
outstanding
taken
from
my
notes
on

poured
into
a
duvel
glass
pretty
darn
carbonated
as
a
white
tidal
wave
reached
the
rim
hazy
golden
in
appearance
i
picked
up
some
nice
fruity
esters
with
a
touch
of
honey
on
the
aroma
very
crisp
spicy
on
the
taste
with
not
too
much
sweetness
that
i
typically
find
on
american
belgianstyle
beers
zesty
yeasty
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
touch
thin
for
a
11
beer
drychampagne
like
finish
d
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
i
do
not
think
that
the
end
of
the
keg
is
the
best
representative
i
will
probably
rerate
this
down
the
road
but
until
then
md
very
nice
particularly
given
the
potent
bomber
foiled
capped
and
wo
freshnessvintage
info
pours
clear
wo
nearly
the
expected
carbonation
for
the
style
quite
minor
head
just
a
thin
film
but
leaving
plenty
of
fine
intricate
lacing
upon
a
gentle
swirl
tons
of
very
tiny
bubbles
continuing
to
rise
to
the
top
nose
is
lightly
of
fresh
fruits
with
alcohol
and
coriander
tasty
clearly
high
quality
offering
light
coriander

some
warming

juniper

complexity
is
impressive
another
stunner
from
alesmith
what
is
in
that
san
diego
water
go
and
get
some
if
you
can
find
it
in
your
local
area
d
this
was
easily
drinkable
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
pick
up
again
an
excellent
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
purchasing
again
unique
d
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
very
satisfying
drinks
great
for
the
abv
style
rivals
anything
i
had
in

quickly

through

a

not
11
mouthfeel
is
good
but
slightly
abrasive
on
the

drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
brew
of
this
weight
another
good
one
from
the
brewmelders
at
alesmith
thanks
again
for
the
trade
dana
oh
yes
drinkability
is
good
as
is
this
beer
overall
not
great
with
some
technical
faults
but
overall
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
still
think
id
peg
it
as
american
in
a
blind
tasting
which
is
a
turnoff
for
me
in
the
style
i
thought
this
was
really
good
and
would
recommend
thanks
to
surlysober
for
sharing
big
ass
bottle
pours
a
very
clear
mandarin
orange
color
im
not
familiar
with
the
labeled
coriander
aroma
nor
flavor
but
i
smell
and
taste
honey
and
i
like
it
it
is
a
nicely
balanced
sweet
beer
with
a
long
dry
finish
i
cant
believe
the
bottle
says
11
alcohol
its
very
hidden
although
i
might
be
trashed
after
drinking
this
whole
thing
horny
devil
pours
a
hazy
deep
gold
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
head
remains
thick
after
disappating
just
a
little
lots
of
lacing
is
left
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
sour
with
a
moderate
hop
aroma
that
is
a
little
earthy
there
is
also
a
butterscotch
and
pear
smell
present
the
coriander
and
spices
used
create
a
pleasant
peppery
scent
for
an
11
beer
the
alcohol
is
so
well
balanced
that
it
is
barely
noticeable
the
sweetness
combines
with
the
hoppiness
and
creates
a
wonderful
flavor
with
a
spicy
aftertaste
coriander
orange
and
white
pepper
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
along
with
bananas
in
the
aftertaste
horny
devil
leaves
the
tongue
tingling
and
yearning
for
more
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
with
a
nice
effervescence
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
i
highly
recommend
it
d
a
very
good
bspa
youd
never
know
it
was
11
00
alc
vol
theres
virtually
no
alcohol
taste
at
all
a
very
good
production
got
this
in
a
recent
shipment
from
vin
de
pays
long
beach
ca
it
pours
a
cloudy
color
into
my
glass
i
can
definitely
pick
up
on
the
coriander
yeast
and
some
clove
the
taste
is
great
as
you
can
pick
up
on
the
coriander
and
get
some
of
the
hops
i
think
that
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
in
this
beer
making
it
very
drinkable
the
price
is
high
for
this
beer
but
its
definitely
one
that
i
will
buy
again
when
i
get
my
allowance
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
an
interesting
twist
on
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
a
little
to
much
spice
and
not
enough
beer
flavors
to
really
be
a
favorite
of
mine
for
this
style
but
its
still
an
interesting
beer
thats
worth
a
try

slowly
patchy
lacing
coriander
orange

and
yeast
in

mediumbodied
with
a

flavors
of
belgian
candi
sugar
yeast
and
sweet
spices
are
all
present
touches
of
alcohol
and
malt
are
present
as
well
the
finish
is
sweet
sugar
and
spice
and
lingers
a
bit
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
belgian
although
it
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
standard
set
by
alesmiths
other
beers
it
swings
a
little
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
so
the
complexity
suffers
a
bit
as
a
result
i
would
get
this
again
but
the
price
would
make
me
think
twice
dthis
is
a
very
nice
bspa
i
will
buy
this
again
the
next
time
i
am
outof
state
as
well
as
the
alesmith
and
yulesmith
ipas
alesmith
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favoritesbut
i
cant
get
it
unless
i
take
an
80
min
trip
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticable
in
the
mouthfeel
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
my
favorite
stylebut
is
not
my
favorite
example
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
improvement
i
do
wish
that
more
of
these
americanbelgians
were
brewed
with
the
same
craftmanship
as
this
one
syrupy
mouthfeel
followed
by
an
amazing
dry
finish
im
almost
getting
a
dry
white
wine
feel
with
this
one
other
mentioned
the
sweetness
but
i
just
dont
see
it
looked
for
a
date
on
the
bottle
and
couldnt
find
one
im
thinking
this
has
mellowed
considerably
with
time
this
one
is
a
nice
sipper
maybe
a
little
one
dimensional
dosnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
certainly
better
than
many
seam
to
think
i
would
certainly
give
this
one
a
repeat
visit
this
is
a
potent
brew
with
some
very
good
flavor
it
may
be
too
powerful
for
the
flavor
profile
i
will
be
curious
to
see
what
my
friends
who
frequent
belgium
might
say
overall
an
ok
brew
but
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
seemed
one
dimensional
and
lacking
character
not
a
beer
that
i
will
have
again
i
like
belgians
but
this
wasnt
one
worst
alesmith
beer
yet
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
one
had
a
bad
cap
seal
because
i
would
expect
more
carbonation
in
this
ale
style
i
will
leave
this
as
a
placeholder
and
try
again
still
caps
dont
normally
leak
the
taste
is
rather
forgettable
im
a
big
lover
of
alesmith
beers
but
this
is
easily
the
least
of
their
offerings
not
a
bad
beer
mind
you
just
not
overpowering
theres
some
slight
malt
some
weird
spices
again
what
are
those
maybe
a
hint
of
a
fruit
background
just
not
as
much
here
im
used
to
alesmith
offerings
being
explosive
taste
grenades
and
this
isnt
it
tastes
like
a
toned
down
douple
ipa
mixed
with
a
toned
down
scotch
ale
if
such
a
thing
could
be
imagined
pours
a
clear
gold
with
out
much
of
a
head
almost
looks
like
a
macro
the
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
large
hint
of
apples
with
belgian
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
is
mostly
of
tart
apples
much
like
the
smell
with
belgian
spices
and
a
decent
malty
character
the
warming
alcohol
is
quite
nice
on
a
fall
evening
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
11
abv
and
quite
drinkable
im
still
disappointed
with
the
unnoteworthy
appearance
but
overall
an
interesting
brew
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
powerful
pale
malt
scent
that
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
spicey
coriander
aroma
its
got
a
wonderful
fruity
yeast
aroma
it
blends
well
with
the
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
damn
good
malt
flavor
its
warm
yet
mellowed
out
with
the
coriander
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
kick
ass
fruity
yeast
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
belgian
style
brew
its
got
great
malt
character
as
well
as
excellent
spice
and
yeast
content
d
very
good
the
alcohol
presence
is
made
known
but
its
not
too
intrusive

what
a
disappointment
and
what
potential
this
beer
has
the
downer
is
the
pour
theres
no
head
a
belgian
with
no
head
not
good
for
starters
the
smell
is
candied
sugars
coriander
fruits
alcohol
the
taste
is
so
compromised
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
head
and
mid
section
that
this
beer
just
falls
down
in
all
the
wrong
places
it
wasnt
until
i
read
some
reviews
that
i
discovered
that
the
beer
i
poured
wasnt
flat
after
all
the
complexity
is
nice
and
there
is
plenty
of
balance
to
talk
about
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
warming
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
the
lack
of
any
carbonation
which
just
kills
it
for
me
my
next
one
this
evening
will
be
a
karmeliat
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
pour
d
fantastic
beer
just
phenomenal
drinkability
wonderful
to
taste
again
after
about
730
days
exactly
d
this
really
reminds
me
of
dogfish
120
very
thick
quite
hoppy
and
hard
as
hell
to
drink
some
decent
carbonation
would
help
this
beer
tremendously
the
best
feature
is
the
hop
character
but
it
isnt
good
enought
to
redeem
this
one
i
am
not
going
to
dump
it
but
i
am
pretty
pissed
off
that
i
paid
12
99
for
this
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
amazing
aroma
of
coriander
apricot
and
maybe
a
little
citrus
to
it
excellent
full
mouthfeel
complex
flavor
definite
coriander
start
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
as
well
finish
is
almost
peachlike
a
great
offering
from
alesmith
d
this
beer
is
simple
but
has
a
great
flavor
even
though
it
has
lots
of
sweet
flavors
it
is
not
syrupy
sweet
and
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
the
alcohol
does
play
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
really
smooth
for
such
high
alcohol
content
drinkability
the
11
abv
is
well
integrated
a
good
drinker
in
its
prime
im
sure
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
not
under
these
circumstances
im
still
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
something
else
from
this
brewer
aftertaste
leaves
you
with
sugar
and
orange
peel
plus
something
a
little
stale
i
think
the
alcohol
and
yeast
reminents
poured
from
a
750ml
green
bottle
with
a
red
foil
cover
and
a
simple
cap
ive
had
this
beer
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
in
my
cellar
not
sure
how
long
it
was
in
the
store
i
want
to
say
first
that
i
love
the
alesmith
products
and
i
love
all
belgian
styles
that
being
saaid
this
one
at
least
at
this
age
can
only
be
described
as
a
fruit
bomb
and
was
a
little
bit
of
a
shocker
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
and
left
minimal
laccing
my
sample
didnt
seem
quite
as
flat
as
some
others
have
reported
but
it
was
a
little
low
in
carbonation
the
smell
and
taste
were
both
very
fruity
but
changed
significantly
toward
the
tropical
as
the
bottle
warmed
and
breathed
some
banana
and
apricot
as
well
as
coriander
on
the
nose
at
first
and
then
as
it
warmed
huge
mango
aromas
the
taste
was
similar
with
more
restrained
coriander
banana
and
apricot
at
first
and
then
huge
apricot
mango
and
persimmon
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
slick
but
there
was
some
creaminess
there
as
well
and
as
noted
the
carbonation
was
slightly
low
i
liked
this
beer
at
first
but
as
the
intense
tropical
flavors
grew
it
just
became
a
little
overwhelming
and
hard
to
finish
it
was
that
fruity
i
even
like
fruit
beers
but
this
was
super
intense
and
also
too
sweet
in
the
end
drinkability
suffers
slightly
from
the
high
abv
lack
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
sipper
id
like
to
try
fresher
this
is
one
beer
i
could
easily
drink
and
drink
up
until
that
point
where
the
11
starts
kicking
in
highly
recommended
a
good
beer
but
perhaps
the
alcohol
kills
the
taste
a
bit
sampled
from
a
goblet
hazy
golden
color
with
a
steadyrising
bead
thick
and
bright
white
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
of
foam
mostly
fruity
bananatype
smells
from
yeast
most
likely
also
sweet
bready
smells
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
light
clovey
spiciness
the
fairly
high
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
has
a
raisiny
taste
in
aftertaste
excellent
mouthfeel
that
is
mostly
on
the
creamy
side
laces
glass
fairly
well
as
it
empties
moderate
dryness
in
mouthfeel
as
it
warms
good
drinkability
especially
with
the
booziness
not
ever
really
showing
up
for
me
d
nice
and
tasty
hides
its
abv
well
good
domestic
take
on
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
a
subtle
twist
however
this
beer
was
really
drikable
despite
its
11
abv
i
think
the
only
thing
they
could
do
is
bring
the
abv
down
to
910
range
and
it
would
provide
a
perfect
balance
cheers
d
the
strong
spices
and
big
abv
make
pounding
this
ale
impossible
but
the
flavors
are
nice
and
almost
reminiscent
of
a
chimay
blue
drinkabilityoverall
an
interesting
belgianesque
beer
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
coriander
which
is
what
this
beer
claims
as
its
feature
ingredient
but
still
a
light
and
vday
appropriate
fruity
ale
at
11
the
booze
lets
itself
be
known
but
with
only
a
half
glass
left
from
the
750
im
feeling
no
worse
for
wear
mission
accomplished
drinkability
is
a
little
below
average
because
the
beer
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
if
youre
not
ready
for
it
the
coriander
is
quite
strong
but
after
a
little
while
the
taste
buds
adapt
its
not
going
to
please
everyone
right
away
a
very
vigorous
pour
only
gets
about
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
on
top
of
this
glowing
orange
amber
body
nose
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
orange
cherry
candy
anise
and
soft
malt
long
malt
candied
sweetness
rushes
the
tast
buds
as
you
take
first
sip
it
is
very
silky
smooth
with
great
backbone
to
the
palate
for
all
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
ver
well
balanced
and
wonderful
for
the
style
leaves
a
thick
mouthfeel
makes
you
want
another
sip
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
well
made
brew
d
not
your
typical
belgian
strong
pale
in
my
mind
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
bog
alcohol
punch
a
heavy
dose
of
coriander
when
i
pour
the
yeast
into
my
last
sip
pours
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
a
chillhaze
and
a
short
creamy
white
head
nose
is
coriander
and
spicy
yeast
along
with
fruity
alcohol
esters
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
bean
taste
begins
with
sweet
bready
malts
and
candied
sugar
along
with
coriander
and
fruity
yeast
followed
by
a
bit
of
vanilla
extract
perhaps
a
bit
more
coriander
and
noticeable
alcohol
than
i
would
have
liked
but
still
quite
enjoyable
the
taste
is
very
complex
sweet
and
candied
with
a
very
dry
spicy
finish
nice
hops
bitterness
with
a
grassy
herbal
flavor
seems
like
a
little
too
much
at
once
tastes
quite
strong
but
definitely
not
in
the
11
range
so
it
is
smooth
in
that
regard
still
not
feeling
it
especially
compared
to
other
alesmith
offerings
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
ba
dogfooddog
750
ml
crown
capped

were
it
not
for
the
alcohol
weight
id
think
this
was
a
refreshing
sports
drink
were
it
not
for
yeasty
afteraste
id
think
it
was
fine
champagne
its
neither
thank
god
instead
its
just
a
really
tasty
beer
this
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
thats
alittle
on
the
small
side
the
lacing
is
lacking
and
the
head
disappears
abit
quickly
making
this
ok
looking
the
smell
is
pungent
with
coriander
candy
sugar
and
lemonnot
badbut
nothing
fantastic
the
taste
is
almost
thick
and
creamy
with
coriander
lemonwheatcandy
sugar
and
mixed
citrus
zest
the
mf
is
very
good
with
a
medium
creamy
feel
and
a
great
mixture
of
flavors
a
good
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
wellbut
is
lacking
in
some
qualities
that
make
belgians
great
a
pretty
good
little
belgian
pale
ale
i
do
like
the
extra
kick
of
corriander
but
i
think
that
this
brew
has
something
missing
as
far
as
flavor
it
is
still
a
tasty
brew
though
make
no
mistake
recommended
i
would
recommend
it
if
the
carbonation
problem
is
limited
to
this
beer
otherwise
it
is
a
major
fault
in
my
opinion
recieved
i
think
from
zorro
in
a
trade
probably
last
fall
or
winter
and
cellared
since
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
color
was
of
a
thick
hazy
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
and
there
was
absolutley
no
foam
what
so
ever
at
first
i
could
smell
spicies
and
a
hint
of
a
yeasty
nature
the
taste
was
of
spices
but
couldnt
pick
up
any
yeast
taste
this
belgium
ale
is
thick
but
kind
of
flat
tasting
i
like
the
flavor
but
the
flatness
is
what
makes
this
ale
just
average
instead
of
upbove
average
all
in
all
it
still
an
enjoyable
belgium
ale
bottom
line
my
initial
impression
was
soso
but
the
more
i
sipped
on
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
more
it
pleased
my
palate
my
hats
off
to
alesmith
once
again
md
apart
from
being
nearly
thick
and
tasty
nearly
chewy
this
beer
is
warming
it
warms
the
mouth
tongue
throat
on
the
way
down
the
only
drawback
is
the
fizziness
but
its
so
slight
it
doesnt
take
anything
away
from
the
beer
it
upholds
alesmiths
reputation
handily
bottle
courtesy
of
black95tt
poured
a
light
orangey
color
ale
with
a
good
foamy
head
with
little
retention
aroma
of
spices
is
clearly
dominating
with
some
traces
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
spices
that
probably
include
coriander
also
dominate
taste
as
well
as
slightly
funky
yeast
some
sweet
malt
and
a
light
dry
finish
alcohol
is
well
masked
which
i
appreciated
but
body
was
a
bit
too
watery
for
the
style
d
this
beer
is
definately
better
on
tap
than
it
is
in
the
bottle
very
much
enjoyable
on
draft
disapointing
this
wasnt
the
complexion
or
finess
i
expected
with
alesmith
its
good
but
rather
bold
without
boasting
much
substance
a
definte
split
personality
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
little
head
very
unimpressive
smell
likewise
is
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
subtle
yeast
ho
hum
then
the
taste
kicks
in
jekyll
and
hyde
for
sure
a
full
malty
citrus
smooth
experience
that
must
be
sampled
to
be
appreciated
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
beyond
smooth
from
front
to
back
palate
for
11
abv
this
is
unbelievably
smooth
on
the
drinkability
scale
get
past
the
appearance
and
smell
and
experience
a
truly
great
brew
it
may
seem
strange
for
me
to
thank
clickpush
for
this
beer
since
i
seemed
unhappy
with
it
but
this
was
an
extra
he
threw
in
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
ba
heart
for
that
i
thank
you
my
friend
i
am
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
a
dirty
blonde
leaving
a
very
thin
white
lace
the
aroma
is
honey
cloves
super
sweet
natural
honey
candy
is
what
comes
to
mind
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
very
sweet
the
alcohal
is
faint
well
hidden
masking
the
11
but
warming
as
this
beer
warms
a
bit
candied
orange
peach
and
caramel
all
come
to
mind
the
finish
is
smooth
and
lite
one
that
you
need
to
sip
and
enjoy
slowly
this
beer
is
yet
another
example
of
the
brewing
excellence
emanating
from
southern
california
in
general
and
alesmith
in
particular
style
after
style
hits
the
bull
right
smack
dab
on
the
nose
and
horny
devil
is
no
exception
after
drinking
alesmith
beer
i
always
wish
that
i
had
picked
up
at
least
a
case
when
i
had
the
chance
that
more
than
anything
else
is
the
mark
of
a
worldclass
brewery
cheers2beers
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
clean
the
finish
leaves
a
slightly
herbal
tingle
in
your
throat
but
overall
has
little
long
term
effect
on
the
mouth
this
makes
it
frighteningly
drinkable
for
something
pushing
11
light
smooth
airy
and
creamy
and
nonfilling
means
you
can
really
get
yourself
into
trouble
with
this
stuff
a
good
sipper
strives
to
be
well
rounded
but
seems
to
be
on
the
cusp
of
ageinspired
destruction
dont
think
this
will
improve
too
much
further
than
the
18
months
have
pushed
it
good
beer
for
a
u
s
overall
iffy
for
something
wrapped
up
so
pretty
opened
with
the
teensiest
pfft
and
microscopic
bubbles
can
be
seen
in
the
brew
not
particularly
hopeful
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
lazy
bigbubbled
yet
uneven
head
above
the
orangey
copper
still
apple
juice
colored
brew
big
bubbles
lasting
around
the
edges
but
no
longer
much
of
a
head
with
some
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
some
spices
with
a
sweet
fruity
tinge
to
it
as
well
taste
is
pervasive
spices
with
granular
sugary
malt
component
coupled
to
a
light
fruitiness
and
alcoholic
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
still
lacking
due
to
low
carbonation
but
at
least
this
brew
was
better
than
my
last
experience
guess
i
wont
bother
to
revisit
this
again
good
medium
body
to
this
lightish
looking
ale
dont
let
the
looks
fool
you
or
youll
get
hurt
11abv
i
think
so
this
one
surely
fits
its
style
even
though
it
looks
like
a
belgian
blond
it
just
tastes
like
a
strong
belgian
brew
period
enjoy
on
tap
at
the
brewery
very
thin
white
head
with
small
amount
of
lace
tons
of
spicy
phenols
and
herbs
in
the
belian
aroma
i
could
smell
this
all
day
long
very
tight
small
bubbles
that
explode
this
effervecent
aroma
taste
is
good
a
little
too
much
phenols
for
me
but
still
a
good
taste
excellent
on
the
palate
wanting
more
after
the
crisp
finish
very
drinkable
brew
for
this
high
alcohol
brew
the
smell
is
nice
and
strong
but
coriander
and
spice
are
so
powerful
that
nothing
else
can
come
through
it
doesnt
dominate
the
taste
however
pale
malt
esters
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
are
all
present
spice
and
coriander
come
strong
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
sharp
while
drinkability
is
great
for
the
alcoholic
content
virtually
no
head
developed
when
i
poured
this
alcoholic
monster
only
a
tiny
ring
appeared
after
some
time
its
a
bright
goldcopper
color
with
tiny
floating
specks
of
matter
floating
about
nice
color
but
without
much
head
it
seems
dull
the
smell
is
citrusy
orangeand
hoppy
but
not
that
potent
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
that
strong
in
the
aroma
suprisingly
the
flavor
takes
time
to
develop
sweet
and
fruity
at
the
start
slowly
becoming
sour
and
alcoholic
at
the
finish
almost
way
too
alcoholic
not
very
bitter
but
the
alcohol
rides
too
high
and
ruins
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
and
it
feels
thin
also
i
liked
where
they
tried
to
go
with
this
but
it
became
hard
to
drink
after
while
and
i
usually
like
strong
brews
clear
gold
topped
by
a
rich
white
head
spotty
lace
throughout
toasted
malt
aroma
with
rich
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
spice
and
coriander
theres
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
peaks
through
as
it
warms
bready
sweetness
hits
you
first
but
is
quickly
balanced
by
a
restrained
bitterness
spice
fills
out
the
mid
and
leads
into
the
finish
where
it
combines
with
mild
alcohol
warmth
and
dryness
full
bodied
and
palate
coating
rich
texture
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
blended
into
the
character
of
the
beer
making
it
a
dangerously
easy
drink
thanks
drjay
body

nearly
large

soft
and
refined
with

concealed

making

a
powerful
punch
i
really
would
like
to
try
one
of
these
on
my
own
not
just
as
a
taster
great
balance
of
hops
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
taste
out
of
this
world
one
of
the
best
tasting
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
the
experience
of
tasting
this
is
my
first
alesmith
but
definitely
not
my
last
i
think
i
can
pick
up
a
speedway
stout
and
enjoy
it
just
as
much
in
the
next
few
weeks
drinkability
goes
down
super
easy
and
really
hits
you
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
will
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
very
little
lacing
to
note
nose
is
sweet
of
spices
and
belgian
candy
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
of
pepper
spices
and
belgian
yeast
somewhat
smooth
and
an
alcohol
warming
finish
in
the
belly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
good
the
abv
is
very
high
and
it
is
well
masked
in
the
taste
it
is
worthy
of
a
try
but
rather
expensive
and
one
of
those
special
occasion
brews
750ml

a

no

taste
tangy
sweet
with

medium

very
drinkable
at
11
abv
which
the
bottle
sez
i
like
this
offering
from
alesmith
very
nice
would
buy
again
and
recommend
to
people
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
smell
of
horny
devil
which
captures
a
pleasing
barnyard
essence
offset
by
a
slight
whiff
of
ginger
ale
very
classy
the
body
is
clear
autumn
yellow
with
a
few
flocs
casual
carbonation
and
minimal
head
the
taste
is
golden
rustic
and
traditional
with
very
little
evidence
of
the
11
abv
a
late
surge
of
coriander
compliments
the
finish
though
something
in
the
end
does
manage
to
fall
flat
perhaps
as
a
result
of
poor
cellaring
i
would
definitely
seek
this
again
dark
gold
color
very
clear
with
virtually
no
head
at
all
what
the
heck
the
aroma
is
very
rich
orange
coriander
yeast
in
the
form
of
fresh
bread
and
i
live
above
a
bakery
this
is
one
beer
where
the
aroma
pretty
much
exactly
matches
the
flavor
distinct
coriander
and
orange
zest
that
is
backed
by
fresh
baked
bread
sourdough
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
jolly
ranchers
orange
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
tacky
yet
is
still
a
bit
light
there
is
a
ton
of
alcohol
here
possibly
a
bit
too
much
this
could
hurt
the
drinkability

the

it
smells

spicy
it

smells
slightly
honey
like
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
i
hate
to
say
it
since
i
like
most
alesmith
beers
but
i
am
not
too
fond
of
the
aroma
of
this
beer
this
beer
tastes
quite
syrupy
it
is
very
sweet
very
sweet
i
taste

a
malty

to

this

this

is
quite

i
dont

this

would
make
a
good
session

it

quite

the

might
be

much
this

dont
go

it
is
a

some

complex
flavor
its
a
hazy
golden

bit
of
alcoholic
heat
but
edges
on
cloying
with
excessive
sweetness
it
also
has
an
excessive
butteriness
that
adds
to
the
cloyingness
to
me
with
scarcely
any
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
mild
then
yields
to
lightly
citric
fruitiness
richly
complex
with
such
a
lush
and
complex
character
big
on
sweetness
but
the
other
attributes
of
this
brew
hold
up
strong
to
keep
it
in
check
other
than
the
head
lacking
really
solid
i
recommend
this
to
my
customers
often
the
booze
is
completely
hidden
a
bit

but
not
cloying
i
prefer

thanks
to

peachy

this
beer
stays
very
relevant
in
the

i
can
enjoy
this

it

my

is

i
am
a

of
both
breweries
that
came
together
for
this
one
and
the
beer
does
not
disappoint
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
ommegang
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
overall
a
nice
showcase
of
belgian
yeast
there
is
plent
of
it
here
a
strong

for

definitely

this

while
i
figured
it
would
be
a
good
beer
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
quite
that
impressive
i
was
completely
taken
aback
by
its
quality
the
store
manager
at
the
place
i
went
to
may
not
know
what
he
has
on
his
hands
so
i
will
probably
go
buy
him
out
of
this
stuff
absolutely
condor
recommended
and
approved
had
this
at
brown
iron
brewery
on
tap
and
it
was
very
good
belgian
blonde
one
of
better
ones
ive
had
would
recommend
trying
overall
a
truly
impressive
belgian
style
offering
that
for
the
most
part
is
belgian
by
ownership
but
brewed
in
america
it
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
if
the
sweetness
was
dropped
a
slight
bit
it
might
even
be
confused
for
some
of
the
finest
belgians
but
then
it
wouldnt
be
very
unique
interesting
completely
satisfying
and
almost
compellingly
drinkable

hmm
stamped
best
by

but
seems
to
have
plenty
of
time
left
overall
this
beer
lived
up
to
my
expectations
i
am
a
fan
of
the
ommegang
brewery
and
i
like
le
chouffe
so
when
i
saw
the
le
chouffe
gmomes
dancing
on
an
omegong
bottle
i
had
to
try
it
this
is
a
sweet
blonde
ale
with
some
great
spicing
the
blend
of
spices
is
so
balanced
that
it
is
difficult
to
pick
out
individual
flavors
in
short
this
was
an
excellent
blonde
ale
to
sample
around
the
holidays
so
good
that
i
texted
my
grampa
while
drinking
it
and
told
him
i
was
groot
a
reviewer
below
reviewed
gnomegang
on
12714
they
defined
the
beer
as
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
also
feeling
that
the
hop
content
was
not
harmonious
with
a
belgian
yeast
profile
i
see
a
contradiction
in
thought
process
here
to
say
that
the
beers
harmony
is
compromised
by
the
hop
profile
demonstrates
some
palate
savvy
along
with
the
ability
to
produce
an
articulate
insight
a
very
useful
quality
however
to
say
that
its
too
hoppy
for
their
liking
leads
me
to
believe
that
they
are
part
of
the
shock
top
crowd
thus
should
not
be
rating
a
beer
like
this
consequently
they
shouldnt
be
indoctrinating
themselves
into
craft
beer
by
drinking
gnomegang
rather
they
should
start
with
something
like
yuengling
or
however
the
heck
you
spell
it
gnomegang
is
not

this

i
just
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
dont
read
my
review
if
you
like
wheat
beers
o
what
a
lovely
holiday
release
from
ommegang
it
has
that
signature
belgian
taste
to
it
and
is
crafted
well
enough
to
where
you
are
exposed
to
the
flavors
rather
than
the
alcohol
content
incredibly
drinkable
downright
sessionable
it
has
that
wonderful
flowery
bite
of
a
pale
the
smoothness
of
a
blonde
and
the
fruity
piquancy
of
a
tripel
wonderfully
done
its
good
beer
but
not
my
flavor
style
it
has
a
light
hop
and
sweet
taste
that
pairs
well
another
successful
brew
from
ommegang
coriander
dry
a
little
sweetness
that
lingers
great
crisp
taste
i
have
grown
fond
of
the
higher
alcohol
beers
over
the
last
few
months
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
one
but
it
has
been
great
o
this
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
what
it
is
has
a
passing
resemblance
to
delirium
tremens
but
that
beer
comes
off
a
bit
harsher
and
drier
from
the
bottle
the
chouffe
yeast
is
fn
royalty
among
the
belgians
i
could
drink
this
shtuff
all
day
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
for
me
has
subtle
yeast
and
spicy
qualities
descent
drinking
solid
beer
well
worth
a
purchase
love
ommegang
brews
but
not
this
one
it
misses
the
mark
leaves
a
nasty
after
taste
that
requires
a
cheesesteak
and
a
miller
lite
to
wash
away
o
a
great
offering
from
two
great
breweries
i
lean
towards
the
chouffe
side
normally
and
was
not
disappointed
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
highly
recommend
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orange
hay
with
yeast
floating
around
the
two
finger
head
quickly
dissipates
but
shows
no
signs
of
disproportionation
or
other
flaws
the
aroma
is
clean
and
the
spice
is
indistinguishable
showing
they
are
doing
an
excellent
job
has
some
aromas
similar
to
weiss
beers
like
bubblegum
drinks
very
clean
with
light
small
bubbles
and
a
well
rounded
yeast
taste
on
the
palate
nice
orange
color
towering
thick
white
head
good
lacing
on
the

nose
brings
promise
of
orange
rind
and
pith
coriander
spiciness
cut
flowers
and
fruit
taste
doesnt
follow
through
all
the
way
citrus
and
fruitiness
with
some
of
the
spiciness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
present
but
doesnt
distract
mouthfeel
is
light
side
of
medium
with
tingly
almost
prickly
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
a
very
good
beer
but
im
not
convinced
its
worth
the
price
tag
part
of
this
reminded
me
of
a
witbier
since
the
yeast
and
funk
wasnt
too
strong
and
the
alcohol
was
recessed
enough
that
this
seemed
like
a
session
beer
obviously
the
latter
was
not
the
case
here
as
i
could
feel
the
booze
kicking
in
by
the
time
i
finished
this
bottle
off
i
have
to
admit
that
many
of
ommegangs
beers
start
to
taste
the
same
to
me
after
a
while
but
when
theyre
good
enough
to
be
mistaken
with
something
imported
who
cares
i
dont
and
this
was
another
great
example
of
why
i
love
these
guys
so
much
a
hint
of
spice
combined
with
belgian
fruity
flavors
and
the
perceived
absence
of
alcohol
combined
for
a
beer
that
ill
reach
for
again
even
if
i
dont
consider
it
to
be
a
categorical
anomaly
fun
stuff
overall
drinkability
refreshing
wonderfully
crafted
and
a
great
savoringsipping
beer
alcohol
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
suspect
if
i
had
bought
a
4
pack
rather
than
a
single
id
be
cracking
open
another
bottle
and
regretting
it
later
but
the
wonderful
flavor
of
this
beer
is
making
me
wish
i
had
bought
that
4
pack
rather
than
the
single
which
tells
me
overall
this
a
great
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
indeed
wowed
by
the
flavor
of
this
beer
prost
overall
we
have
ourselves
a
winner
i
am
curious
to
see
if
the
larger
750ml
would
have
any
effect
on
the
bottle
conditioning
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
golden
yellow
color
minimal
head
aroma
of
strong

was

very

very
belgian
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
well
made
belgian
strong
golden
for
sure
would
i
order
this
again
no
but
id
buy
abotyle
for
my
girlfriend
she
liked
it
a
lot
super
drinkability
reminds
me
of
tank
7
in
many
ways
but
i
think
this
beer
was
first
overall
a
really
nice
collaboration
incredibly
drinkable
really
well
done
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
than
this
good
from
ommegang
overall
another
nice
ommegang
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
good
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
esters
with
a
smooth
body
overall
pretty
good
overall
but
i
expected
more
specifically
i
would
have
liked
a
light
spicier
more
effervescent
bspa
this
beer
is
better
than
i
expected
it
has
a
hazy
floatie
laden
beer
the
head
is
enormous
and
lasting
the
smell
is
fruity
apricot
peach
pear
and
lots
of
belgian
bubblegum
and
clove
yeast
mope
prey
but
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
slanted
sweet
with
a
continuation
of
the
fruit
theme
spice
in
the
mid
taste
and
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
great
beer
an
outstanding
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
a
quality
strong
ale
my
staple
is
ommegangs
hennepin
which
sets
the
bar
high
for
saisons
along
with
dupont
but
when
i
want
something
stronger
this
is
where
i
land
if
youre
a
fan
of
victorys
golden
monkey
also
a
very
good
beer
youll
like
this
smoother
than
gm
this
is
a
great
beer
from
ommegang
its
on
par
with
everything
they
do
recommended
this
has
the
family
characteristic
of
just
too
damn
much
yeasty
intensity
the
flavor
is
good
its
just
totally
relentless
it
give
you
no
space
for
savoring
a
water
chaser
is
needed
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
overall
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
the
spice
and
yeast
contributions
remind
me
a
lot
of
a
tripel
which
makes
sense
given
that
a
case
could
probably
be
made
that
tripels
are
essentially
just
a
subset
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
its
taken
me
far
too
long
to
finally
try
this
and
now
that
i
have
ill
have
to
make
a
habit
out
of
picking
some
up
from
time
to
time
odinteresting
but
not
much
more
in
my
opinion
didnt
really
like
the
flavors
presented
here
still
an
average
to
above
average
beer
so
i
wont
kill
it
i
can
objectively
see
why
people
would
like
it
but
i
wont
be
rushing
to
grab
any
more
of
this
overall
this
is
a
quality
belgian
ale
all
flavors
are
in
their
right
place
and
not
muddled
she
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
being
a
little
strong
she
is
well
crafted
and
very
appealing
to
me
maybe
ommegang
should
start
using
chouffe
yeast
hybrid
another
outstanding
ale
from
ommegang
this
is
recommended

from
my
tasting
notes
the
gnomegang
was
a
belgian
golden
ale
in
the
same
vein
as
duvel
it
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
generous
fizzy
head
there
was
plenty
of
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
balance
by
their
trademark
yeasts
the
taste
was
bright
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
plenty
of
that
farmhouse
flavor
it
hides
its
high
alcohol
content
well
and
maintains
its
excellence
as
it
warms
lots
of
carbonation
moves
the
medium
bodied
beer
luxuriously
over
the
tongue
o
hell
yes
balanced
delicate
and
beautiful
would
seek
to
have
again
overall
4
5
this
was
a
surprisingly
smooth
and
tasty
bspa
very
much
worth
the
try
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
from
the
guys
at
ommegang
that
i
would
buy
again
overall
very
good
not
mad
that
i
drank
my
only
bottle
and
cant
get
more
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
bottle
or
two
i
had
this
at
oblivion
tap
room
here
in
orlando
florida
and
was
very
unimpressed
with
it
it
poured
well
in
a
cloudy
gold
tint
with
a
nice
head
it
smelled
slightly
of
cloves
with
hints
of
what
i
thought
was
bananas
as
soon
as
i
tried
it
it
easily
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
i
have
had
recently
i
could
not
taste
what
was
going
on
with
it
not
balanced
at
all
but
very
complex
and
left
a
sweet
bitter
after
taste
you
could
taste
nothing
but
the
cloves
i
could
not
finished
it
for
me
it
was
that
bad
possibly
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
will
not
take
the
change
of
ordering
it
again
ontap
at
oblivion
in
orlando
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orangish
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
banana
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
for
a
beer
of
such
potency
with
fruity
notes
of
apples
and
spices
in
the
finish
with
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
overall
glad
i
tried
this
collaboration
from
two
great
breweries
overall
really
good
a
terrific
bspa
great
example
of
the
style
in
my
view
o
this
beer
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
good
beers
in
the
style
but
is
still
pretty
good
and
quite
drinkable
considering
its
strength
overall
a
great
quaff
o
im
particularly
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
have
brewed
a
number
of
batches
with
the
chouffe
yeast
i
did
a
belgian
blonde
which
came
out
similar
to
this
one
i
take
my
hat
off
to
the
brewery
for
doing
such
a
wonderful
job
with
this
very
enjoyable
beer
o
i
remember
drinking
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
when
it
was
only
available
in
750ml
and
liking
it
a
lot
now
its
only
available
in
a
mixed
8
pack
and
its
the
star
of
the
show
give
me
this
beer
in
4
packs
and
id
be
a
happy
camper
a
gnomegang
three
philosophers
8
pack
would
find
a
frequent
home
in
my
fridge

definitely
have
again
overall
as
high
a
mark
i
can
give
a
beer
without
tasting
all
the
beers
in
the
world
i
paid
15
for
a
750
ml
champagne
corked
bottle
and
i
would
do
it
again
i
highly
recommend
this
ommegang

awesome
and
this
is
a
great
beer

them

have
to

quite
an
enjoyable
strong

nice
work
ommegang
overall
drinkability
better
than
ommegang
abbey
o
another
very
good
beet
from
ommegang
no
surprise
there
not
quite
up
among
my
favorites
from
them
but
knocking
on
the
door
for
sure
overall
very
good
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
ommegang
and
i
generally
like
most
of
their
beers
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
this
was
a
solid
choice
that
ill
keep
collecting
and
pushing
on
others
that
visit
i
loved
it
it
might
need
to
be
rated
higher
but
still
being
a
rookie
at
this
5
months
on
the
craft
beer
scene
im
hesitant
to
give
it
much
more
i
still
want
to
try
others
but
ommegang
has
been
a
wonder
at
introducing
me
to
bpas
fun
fun
overall
coming
into
this
beer
i
was
a
little
intrigued
the
more
i
tasted
the
more
i
truly
enjoyed
a
great
addition
to
my
spring
time
beer
list
the
sweet
flavors
and
aroma
of
lemon
peach
and
even
banana
whilst
being
rounded
out
by
bitter
deep
malts
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
again
and
would
totally
recommend
this
to
a
friend
to
enjoy
a
breezy
spring
night
cheers
on
a
side
note
i
really
like
beers
from
ommegang
and
achouffe
they
are
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
collaboration
overall
had
this
right
after
the
hennepin
they
are
both
similar
but
the
gnomegang
was
just
a
little
more
harsh
in
just
about
every
way
still
a
delicious
brew
but
i
prefer
other
offerings
from
ommegang
still
one
to
try
pours

an

very
very
good

hope
they
release
this
year
round
this
beer
is
really
quite
good
in
fact
i
would
say
it
is
on
the
cusp
of
being
world
class
i
know
there
are
better
versions
out
there
but
i
have
not
had
them
yet
so
i
cant
compare
i
am
going
to
say
that
i
feel
confident
in
giving
this
beer
4s
in
all
the
categories
its
really
excellent
well
balanced
and
pleasant
smells
wheaty
mild
carbonation
mild

light

slightly

maybe
just

inexperience
but
it
tases
remarkably
similar
to
a
wit
typical
beer
for
me
goes
down
easy
could
drink
several
of
these
hides
the
9
5
abv
well
overall
a
very
nice
brew
ive
kept
this
one
around
for
over
a
year
but
that
didnt
seem
to
do
it
any
harm
the
flavor
has
that
bandaid
pineapple
and
citrus
peel
a
bready
malt
along
with
lots
of
spice
character
like
black
pepper
alcohol
hits
on
the
back
and
dries
the
beer
out
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
id
go
for
anything
from
draai
laag
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
gold
with
a
creamyfrothy
foamy
white
head
that
sticks
very
nicely
the
smell
is
simple
clean
and
fruity
it
has
a
grain
note
but
is
primarily
dominated
by
the
yeast
which
is
fruity
with
hint
of
clove
after
it
gets
some
time
to
oxidize
you
can
smell
some
faint
peppery
herbal
hop
aromas
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
the
taste
of
grains
but
with
an
infusion
of
rather
spicy
yeast
it
is
rather
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
overall
4
25
this
is
a
really
really
great
beer
if
youre
into
bspas
at
its
high
points
it
showcases
the
chouffe
and
ommegang
strains
in
a
way
that
they
complement
one
another
you
can
actually
tell
them
apart
in
some
ways
but
they
meet
at
certain
points
too
particularly
in
the
tart
lemony
character
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
americanmade
belgianstyle
beers
and
im
going
to
look
forward
to
this
from
ommegang
in
the
future
as
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
blonde
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
brew
was
the
spice
and
muskiness
through
the
finish
of
the
flavoring
this
imparted
a
genuine
belgian
feel
and
flavor
as
is
seen
with
most
of
ommegangs
offerings
the
high
abv
overt
fumy
booze
and
warming
qualities
kept
things
interesting
where
we
lost
points
was
in
the
sweetness
of
the
flavoring
which
became
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
and
cut
the
pale
and
inherent
drinkability
of
the
style
otherwise
things
were
tasty
and
well
be
happy
to
see
what
another
few
months
does
to
this
guy
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
2011
vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
white
fluffy
head
high
retention
on
a
hazy
almost
opalescent
golden
body
aroma
includes
lemon
grass
lemon
peel
some
banana
and
some
light
candi
sugar
mouth
feel
is
tongue
coating
and
dry
lemony
taste
slightly
sweet
some
peach
and
star
fruit
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
amazingly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
stupendous
wowzers
so
firsties
this
style
is
more
or
less
near
the
bottom
of
my
list
of
favourites
and
yet
this
offering
has
to
go
and
mess
with
that
bias
so
much
so
that
im
now
the
bad
guy
in
this
sad
trope
secondly
mea
culpa
a
bspa
can
apparently
kick
major
ass
as
evidenced
by
the
hefty
layered
fruity
boozy
not
that
you
can
actually
taste
it
goodness
harnessed
herein
a
bit
too
bad
about
its
pricey
intro
to
these
parts
but
ill
say
it
totally
worth
it
oh
and
somehow
im
just
getting
the
beers
name
gnomes
are
brasserie
dacchouffes
thing
and
that
fits
so
well
in
a
pun
with
this
brewers
name
so
um
thats
it
word
o
excellent
belgian
a
delight
to
sip
or
chugbe
careful
a
well
made
beer
overall
a
decent
golden
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
little
too
artificial
on
the
sweet
but
otherwise
quite
a
nice
balance
an
outstanding
brew
from
ommegang
as
so
many
of
their
offerings
are
this
one
was
on
tap
at
bull
and
bush
in
denver
pours
a
very
thick
raw
honey
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
lot
of
suspended
sediment
the
nose
indicates
that
its
got
a
very
unique
yeast
going
on
its
spicy
yet
it
contains
some
fruit
notes
of
peach
and
green
apple
theres
also
a
biscuity
malt
aroma
and
a
candy
sugar
sweetness
that
is
undeniable
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
the
sweetness
is
intense
and
is
the
last
thing
left
in
the
finish
in
addition
to
the
spice
and
light
fruit
from
the
yeast
there
is
also
a
particular
pine
pollen
essence
i
am
gathering
as
well
the
feel
is
great
like
most
ommegang
brews
its
got
spunky
carbonation
and
a
pretty
thick
body
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
not
filling
but
at
9
5
abv
its
not
a
beer
you
are
probably
going
to
have
more
than
one
of
per
sitting
exceptional
stuff
overall
lovely
blend
of
flavors
very
nice
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
quality
i
have
come
to
expect
from
omegang
poured

belgian

and
great

smooth
and
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
very
high
abv
such
a
great
beer
and
i
was
so
pumped
to
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
its
such
a
perfect
collaboration

a

apple

small
earthy

bite

some

in

that

not
cloy

warms
the
gullet
the
9
5
is
not
all
the
way
hidden
feel
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
nice
crisp
carb
after
half
the
glass
this
becomes
all
to
easy
to
drink
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
and
much
better
than
alot
of
american
versions
out
there
i
just
wish
bottles
were
not
so
damn
pricey
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
slide
into
4
packs
or
so
until
then
ill
grab
it
on
tap
i
think
this
rivals
duvel
in
terms
of
bspa
i
found
this
completely
horrible
the
clove
was
way
overdone
and
the
sweetness
provided
a
weird
character
had
i
been
drinking
it
by
myself
it
probably
wouldve
ended
up
down
the
drain
but
i
gutted
through
my
7
oz
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
would
have
it
again
for
cheaper

on
one
hand
the
beer
is
almost
too
sweet
yet
on
the
other
it
isnt
a
little
rich
to
have
another
though
this
is
best
as
a
sipping
beer
but
still
enjoyable
with
a
meal
a
surprising
find
at
the
local
bottle
shop
a
collab
between
achouffe
and
ommegang
cant
be
bad
clever
name
too
it
pours
an
unmiraculous
dull
gold
with
a
thin
pfft
of
white
foam
on
top
despite
the
insipid
appearance
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
bushels
of
tropical
fruit
fill
out
the
body
mango
banana
bitter
melon
kiwi
and
papaya
mild
bitterness
lets
a
sweet
bready
malt
backbone
come
out
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
flavor
or
aroma
the
yeast
does
the
talking
in
this
ale
a
little
more
carbonation
and
dryness
would
go
a
along
way
here
but
the
flavors
are
really
pleasant
a
shame
that
this
is
only
locally
available
in
the
expensive
gift
pack
i
would
love
to
stock
up
on
it
so
much
going
on
at
once
yet
its
all
smooth
and
cohesive
whether
it
all
registers
or
not
would
love
to
scoobydoo
it
more
and
crack
the
case
eventually
yet
for
now
am
content
with
the
memory
of
the
initial
experience
this
is
definitely
something
to
seek
out
wow
slightly
slick
in
the
mouth
with
a
quicker
than
expected
finish
but
a
nice
evolution
of
flavors
the
quick
clean
finish
adds
to
the
drinkability
as
it
makes
you
want
to
take
in
more
alcohol
was
well
concealed
nicely
done
a
classic
belgian
blonde
o
a
very
good
beer
the
alcohol
content
prevents
me
from
being
able
to
drink
very
much
of
this
at
one
time
but
i
will
be
purchasing
it
again
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it

i
really
enjoyed
this
belgian

from

complex
refreshing
and
easy

overall
hard
to

this
is
probably
one
of
the
best

this

lots

a

this

a

try
glad
to
drink
this
again
had
it
at
first
release
a
few
xmas
ago
d
very
enjoyable
and
not
boozy
given
the
abv
definitely
wish
this
was
not
a
limited
beer
into
a
ommegang
specialty

was
green
apple

yeasty

taste
followed
the
scent
but
was
more
intense
than
i
expected
from
this
beer
great
carbonation
and
very
cleansing
taste
this
was
my
favorite
in
this
three

which
included
gnomegang
three
philosophers
and
hennepin
o
this
beer
is
great
the
nose
the
palate
the
feel
its
all
smooth
rich
and
drinkable
the
primary
yeast
from
brasserie
dachouffe
is
a
shining
example
of
belgian
complexity
i
could
drink
this
beer
any

any

tongueprickling

meets
a
medium
body
in
this
beer
that
finishes
remarkably
dry
overall
sharing
many
characteristics
with
a
standard
begianstyle
blonde
this
truly
blurs
the
line
between
tripel
and
saison
it
still
has
the
qualities
to
that
of
chouffe
or
duvel
yet
at
the
same
time
somehow
manages
to
make
a
confident
leap
into
new
territory
i
also
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
here
using
chouffe
yeast
in
the
primary
fermentation
and
ommegang
yeast
in
the
secondary
is
a
really
interesting
and
creative
way
to
make
this
a
real
collaborative
ale
definitely
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
cloudy

funky
yeast
taste
realy
brings
out
the
mango
and
yeast
has
a
medium
body
with
probably
a
little
too
much
carbonation
a
dry
tobacco
taste
is
left
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
one
and
the
price
is
right
notes
from
on
tap
at
the
dutch
hazy
golden
hue
capped
by
an
abundant
white
head
in
my
tulip
glass
nose
is
full
of
tropical
fruit
and
slight
earthiness
taste
follows
suit
with
the
addition
of
spice
from
the
yeast
and
light
malt
medium
bodied
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
o
a
very
drinkable
and
fruity
take
on
a
bspa
i
really
enjoyed
the
tropical
notes
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
globe
glass
beautiful
beer
when
poured
it
is
a
golden
orange
color
a
bit
cloudy
with
active
carbonation
and
an
offwhite
fluffy
head
the
smell
was
not
as
impressive
as
the
appearance
it
may
still
have
been
a
bit
chilled
to
fully
let
out
the
aromas
evident
smells
are
of
apple
and
citrus
and
sweet
alcohols
taste
is
more
complex
than
the
smell
i
get
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
at
first
then
some
spice
and
a
warming
dry
finish
a
bit
of
a
slick
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
nice
collaboration
between
two
excellent
breweries
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
was
really
refreshing
and
well
balanced
certainly
easy
smooth
drinking
this
one
struck
me
as
one
that
would
go
well
with
alot
foods
or
even
just
on
its
own
its
not
the
most
complex
but
makes
up
for
it
largely
in
sheer
balance
and
smoothness
overall
a
good
beer
still
this
wont
make
me
give
up
hennepin
anytime
soon
clear
pale
golden
to
orange
in

a
nice
stream

carbonation
aroma
is
malty
and
wheaty
with
notes
of
honey
coriander
orange
fruity
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
muted
but
it
has
sweet
bready
malts
with
a
good
spicyfruity
kick
from
the
yeast
fruity
hops
come
in
but
are
subtle
adding
a
nicely
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
nicely
balanced
complex
belgian
style
blonde
good
beer
here
and
one
worth
checking
out
if
youre
into
the
belgianstyle
beers
ommegang
seems
to
do
a
great
job
in
keeping
with
the
belgian
tradition
of
brewing
complex
and
tasty
beers
overall
i
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
alas
i
wasnt
still
i
respect
the
creation
though
i
am
not
wild
about
the
way
the
elements
came
together
fantastic
blonde
or
in
this
case
bspa
in
retrospect
at
this
strength
more
like
a
tripel
but
with
a
bit
more
hop
character
though
not
much
ibu
19
overalloriginally
picked
this
up
expecting
worse
and
ended
up
being
outstanding
i
was
expecting
a
seasonal
type
of
brew
but
ends
up
being
a
real
fine
ale
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
body
is
pretty
well
carbonated
but
not
to
the
point
where
the
head
overwhelms
the
body
hope
you
all
enjoy
and
cheers
to
all
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
tongue
prickling
with
modest
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
a
nice
collab
from
two
good
breweries
this
is
a
very
cool
example
of
an
interesting
style
and
it
holds
it
own
very
well
overall
probably
a
4
45
but
alas
we
dont
have
that
this
beer
does
not
seem
to
be
on
point
for
the
style
it
also
has
a
collaboration
pedigree
that
sets
expectations
fairly
high
these
factors
might
seem
like
a
setup
for
disappointment
but
i
couldnt
help
but
really
enjoy
this
beer
if
this
was
available
regularly
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
to
take
to
dinner
parties
with
my
more
wine
inclined
friends
sniff
sniff
spicy
sweet
cloves
honey
lemon
brown
sugar
soapy
mmm
good
job
the
taste
comes
together
as
i
would
expect
i
hear
those
spicy
hops
loud
and
clear
keeps
it
all
reasonable
and
away
from
the
edges
of
cloying
that
some
of
these
breed
are
capable
full
blondelike
body
is
only
part
of
the
story
as
the
stronger
belgian
aspects
work
through
sweet
funk
tang
honey
clove
nutmeg
brown
sugar
citrus
zest
even
a
tad
bit
of
banana
flavor
booze
is
present
and
accounted
for
warmth
is
key
strongest
characteristic
is
easily
the
spicy
warmth
not
bad
good
job
boys
and
girls
at
ommegang
and
lchouffe
o
good
beer
but
it
had
to
be
coming
from
these
two
breweries
overall
i
wasnt
greatly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
feel
the
sweetness
is
just
too
much
and
i
was
done
after
one
glass
o
great
beer
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
even
though
this
is
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
this
was
one
of
the
hiddenbehindthe
cooleryouhadtoaskforit
beers
for
some
reason
and
im
very
happy
with
this
purchase
notes
not
worth
the
12
99
but
still
an
interesting
beer
o
a
very
nice
combination
from
two
of
my
favorite
brewers
overall
super
clean
and
drinkable
light
and
funky
this
one
wows
me
more
with
its
smoothness
than
its
overall
taste
just
complex
enough
to
make
me
want
more
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
very
solid
brewery
o
when
i
saw
and
smelled
the
beer
i
was
slightly
disappointed
as
i
though
this
was
a
sure
winner
once
i
tasted
it
my
disappointment
disappeared
it
is
a
winner
indeed
i
have
a
feeling
a
bit
of
aging
would
up
the
carbonation
slightly
and
make
this
even
better
id
like
to
age
a
bottle
but
i
like
the
hoppy
aspect
and
wouldnt
want
it
to
fade
and
considering
the
price
of
the
gift
pack
i
had
too
buy
to
try
this
one
i
doubt
ill
find
out
still
worth
a
try
i
just
wish
i
could
buy
it
in
singles
o
a
quality
brew
very
complex
nose
and
taste
although
the
abv
sings
through
a
bit
too
much
good
to
try
if
you
like
the
two
brewers
o
if
this
were
blind
i
would
easily
pin
it
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
does
fit
the
style
well
and
is
tastywell
made
overall
but
ive
got
to
dock
it
12
point
because
of
how
omnipresent
the
alcohol
characteristics
are
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
thats
about
all
i
have
to
say
o
nice
effort
by
these
two
breweries
worth
the
price
for
the
bomber
very
flavorful
one
to
savor
o
personally
i
dont
particularly
care
for
ommegang
or
dachouffe
but
this
is
one
amazing
belgian
ale
maybe
they
should
join
forces
permanently
d
as
much
as
i
like
the
flavor
i
wouldnt
like
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
of
this
by
myself
for
the
price
i
think
ommegang
has
lots
of
better
offerings

saving
it
for

with
the
meal
and
it
did
not
disappoint
very
solid
and
very
drinkable
though
the
9

eventually
caught
up
to
me
in
the
end
however
the
abv
was
in
no
way
overwhelming
to
the
beer
in
taste
or
feel
just
a
good
creeper

great
for
a
cold
night
to
keep
you
warm
and
toasty
on
the
inside
my
1st
from
ommegang
i
have
a
rare
vos
chilling
as
well
that
i
plan
to
crack
soon
the
lachouffe
gnome
caught
my
eye
and
i
had
to
try
now
im
craving
la
chouffe
if
they
could
have
hidden
the
alcohol
better
i
would
have
rated
this
much
higher
but
as
is
i
can
only
give
it
a
c
grade

overall
impression
is

herbal
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
pleasant
light
malt
backbone
reveals
itself
theres
also
a
suggestion
of
raisins
and
a
hint
of
something
else
perhaps
mint
perhaps
a
residual
tropical

quality
mouthfeel

with
a

a

burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
that
lingers
between
quaffs
culminating
in
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
bspa
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
well
worth
a
try
if
the
opportunity
presents
t
pretty
good
stuff
here
sonefruit
pear
honey
some

and
belgian

with
a
touch

very
drinkable
a
light
goldengrey
colored
brew
with
a
decent
thin
white

the
aroma
delivers
a
thick
but
tasteful
grainy
alcohol
and
pleasant
clove
with
subtle
orange
citrus
hop
the
flavor
offers
a
commanding
wheat
grain
goodness
with
clovecitrus
brightness
full
of
spicy

allspice
and
a
bit
of
light
alcohol
this
is
medium
bodied
plus
with
a
nearly
cloying
feel
carbonation
is
very
mellow
and
overall
this
is
a
classically
smooth
belgian
beauty
though
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
hoping
still
a
highly
recommended
brew
complements
bob

part
of
a
gift
pack
id
tried
this
one
shortly
after
release
and
probably
wouldnt
have
bought
again
better
the
second
time
around
malty
aroma
nice
yellow
color
not
a
great
head
and
it
faded
quickly
alcohol
well
hidden
not
overly
complex
in
taste
but
a
good
beer
all
the
same
didnt
get
a
lot
of
the
fruity
overtones
and
just
a
hint
of
bubblegum
in
the
back
overall
its
worth
a
shot
the
gift
pack
dropped
the
price
enough
that
id
probably
try
this
again
big
bold
blonde
perhaps
not
hugely
complex
it
has
its
way
with
the
palate
regardless
dare
is
say
dangerously
drinkable
it
is
good
times
rolling
with
this
bottle
4
0
d
overall
a
solid
beer
on
all
fronts
exceptionally
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
the
booze
never
even
shows
up
let
alone
get
in
the
way
good
flavor
profile
definitely
worth
the
purchase
any
of
the
above
4
categories
could
have
been
a
notch
higher
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
the
beer
had
good
and
active
carbonation
was
creamy
with
dry
aftertaste
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
even
given
the
abv
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
at
times
is
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
the
abv
is
well
hiddenintegrated
in
this
brew
which
increases
the
drink
ability
overall
not
a
bad
offering
a
pleasant
dry
finish
keeps
this
one
approachable
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
the
bitter
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
early
on
but
it
mellows
nicely
as
the
beer
warms
definately
a
siipper
given
the
9
5
abv
but
quite
enjoyable
best
quasiportmanteau
name
for
a
beer
ever
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
tawnystraw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
loads
of
banana
wheat
very
light
cobweb
powdered
sugar
and
a
few
sprinkles
of
nutmeg
its
sweet
generally
pleasant
and
loaded
with
banana
the
taste
holds
notes
of
banana
peel
sharp
orange
rind
light
lemon
peel
sweet
flowers
and
light
acetone
man
this
stuff
really
bites
the
tongue
with
bitterness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
decent
brew
but
the
bitterness
comes
across
as
far
too
astringent
for
me
and
to
the
partial
detriment
of
the
belgian
character
no
less
a
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
even
though
everything
else
about
it
works
nicely
o
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
it
was
highly
recommended
to
me
by
a
friend
and
im
glad
i
bought
one
nicely
balanced
and
easydrinking
considering
its
size
not
exactly
groundbreaking
but
some
very
nice
flavors
for
sure
nice
beer
with
some
interest
qualities
but
does
completely
wow
me
much
like
a
fruitier
duvel
to
me
ultimately
a
good
offering
but
not
something
id
necessarily
seek
out
again
dr
hides
its
abv
extremely
well
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
at
the
same
time
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
its
good
to
try
once
but
i
imagine
the
price
doesnt
justify
repeated
purchasing
i
think
the
collaboration
may
actually
have
hurt
the
quality
of
the
beer
in
this
case
i
have
full
confidence
in
both
breweries
independently
overall
this
is
a
really
great
belgian
pale
ale
and
another
great
ommegang
offering
this
was
a
good
tasting
generally
pleasurable
sipper
which
gets
it
good
marks
i
didnt
think
it
was
particularly
unique
for
the
style
which
was
a
bit
odd
given
the
collaboration
and
nature
of
the
two
brewers
so
loses
a
few
points
in
that
respect
still
tasty
and
a
solid
beer
o
it
took
me
a
little
while
to
get
into
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
chance
if
anything
it
provides
evidence
of
just
how
enchanting
these
collaborative
brews
can
be
a
flavorful
but
not
well
crafted
beer
at
least
the
elements
didnt
mesh
as
i
would
like
disappointing
given
the
heritage
of
the
two
breweries
involved
maybe
a
committee
decision
in
any
case
it
is
fruity
and
a
little
earthy
with
a
tad
too
much
spicing
the
high
alcohol
content
also
was
too
evident
juicey
and
syrupy
palate
of
sweet
summer
fruit
oranges
apricots
nectarines
and
apples
lightly
oasted
mlat
and
maybe
a
little
earthy
hop
profile
and
thats
it
oh
yeah
and
some
warm
alcohol
on
the
finish
especially
as
the
beer
warms
very
nice
sipper
great
carbonation
on
the
palate
17
bomber
oa
splendid
ale
worthy
of
your
attention
and
is
probably
food
friendly
given
the
low
carbonation
and
silky
mouthfeel
lovely
deep
cloudy
gold
white

that
leaves
spots
here
and
there
a
fair

evident
as
i
move
the

around

a
lot
of
pale

with

belgian
yeast

well
and
brings
out
a
healthy
breadiness
maybe
a
trace
of

taste
is
so
close
to
perfect
i
may
have
to
come
back
and
p
the
score
it
follows
the
nose
but
adds
a
peppery
bite
a
touch
of
sweet
alcohol
that
melds
into
grains
and
cinnamon
mildly
spicy
hop
finish
that
features
a
bit
of

and

gives
you
a

to
go

too
soon

with

swallow
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
frequently
overall
tasty
reasonablycomplex
and
no
major
flaws
but
i
just
cant
get
myself
to
love
this
for
the
approx
14
it
cost
me
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
another
one

from

better
beers
hooksett
nh
dont
drink
and
review
good
complex
brew
could
see
it
matching
well
with
an
indian
curry
or
chilli
prawns
great
beer
although
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
lachouffe
anyways
ramp
up
the
carbonation
and
maybe
a
bit
more
rustic
character
would
really
put
this
one
over
the
top
a
bit
more
refined
than
i
remember
my
first
lachouffe
being
but
a
great
offering
from
ommegang
nonetheless
this
is
a
example
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
some
of
the
better
flavors
that
belgium
has
to
offer
definitely
worth
a
taste
very
nice
beer
this
oneit
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
comes
across
a
lot
lighter
and
easier
drinking
than
it
is
interestingly
i
put
this
and
the
rare
vos
sidebyside
and
theyre
miles
apart
obviously
this
is
stronger
but
it
shows
how
much
the
strengths
assists
the
style
this
was
fuller
rounder
more
integrated
and
better
balanced
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
delicious
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
without
any
of
the
heaviness
that
usually
accompany
a
beer
of
this
abv
the
only
letdown
here
is
the
subpar
appearance
and
aroma
things
which
ommegang
gets
right
too
often
for
this
misstep
to
occur
ontap
into
a
snifter
bright
gold
in
color
fizzy
bone
white
head
forms
and
leaves
alittle
lace
in
the
aroma
estery
belgian
yeast
and
some
floral
hops
in
the
flavor
nice
dry
yeast
moderate
hop
presence
with
notes
of
earth
pine
and
faint
citrus
alcohol
is
also
rather
pronounced
in
the
flavor
profile
but
does
not
detract
from
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
would
have
liked
more
hops
to
cut
the
alcohol
flavors
a
bit
this
one
was
similar
to
the
ommegang
bpa
only
bigger
o
for
something
that
poured
so
nice
and
looked
so
great
a
little
disappointing
o
a
great
and
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
again
another
thanks
to
my
boss
who
brought
this
one
back
from
belgium
comes
to
cooperstown
o
a
very
nice
collaboration
beer
between
two
great
breweries
drinks
very
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
not
much
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
drinkability
at
9
5
alcohol
you
expect
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
stomach
warming
finish
is
the
only
indicator
expertly
crafted
deceivingly
drinkable
and
full
of
complexities
the
idea
of
the
collaboration
is
interesting
and
the
beer
itself
is
good
but
nothing
particularly
unique
as
i
had
hoped
conforms
well
to
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
bright
malt
with
lively
carbonation
some
yeasty
funk
lurking
in
the
background
with
hints
of
slightly
overripe
apple
finish
is
firm
with
some
pepper
bite
at
the
end
overall
it
struck
me
as
a
bit
fruitier
take
on
duvel
good
stuff
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoy
this
beer
although
i
think
its
more
of
a
late
night
andor
winter
beer
than
a
hot
weather
beer
its
100
degrees
today
despite
pretty
strong
alcohol
presence
this
thing
drinks
so
easily
dangerously
easy
in
the
middle
of
a
countrywide
heat
wave
this
totally
hits
the
spot
but
ill
be
honest
this
would
hit
the
spot
any
day
of
the
year
winter
summer
spring
fall
whatever
if
you
dont
like
this
you
dont
like
belgian
beer
this
is
good
beer
and
a
complex
brew
but
in
the
end
i
much
prefer
their
independent
contributions
keep
trying
though
guys
and
ill
keep
drinking
them
overall
very
good
beer
refreshing
complex
flavorful
im
not
contemplating
buying
more
the
only
thing
that
would
prevent
me
from
that
would
be
price

the

a
bit
light
in
the
flavor
department
d
first
off
kudos
for
a
brilliant
name
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
a
quality
beer
like
this
is
the
result
of
a
collaboration
between
two
excellent
breweries
good
beer
o
not
perfect
by
any
means
but
ive
enjoyed
this
more
than
any
bsda
i
can
remember
yes
there
are
flaws
yes
its
hot
yes
the
mouth
feel
isnt
perfect
but
overall
i
really
enjoy
it
lemon
was
the
first
thing
that
greeted
me
very
bright
flavors
that
really
perked
you
up
and
let
you
prepare
for
what
was
coming
in
behind
them
in
their
wake
were
the
nice
flavors
of
light
yeast
coated
with
pears
and
a
touch
of
fig
with
a
nice
light
spice
sprinkled
in
throughout
these
melded
seamlessly
with
the
light
grainy
back
and
then
rounded
the
corner
to
bring
home
a
nice
dry
long
lasting
finish
that
had
just
the
right
hint
of
bitterness
to
really
make
it
interesting
bottle
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
super
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good

and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
belgian
malt
with
light
bready

and
light

ester
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
semi0sweet
belgian
malt
with
a
bready
yeast
with
light
peppery
notes
and
some
light
refreshing
ester
also
noticeable
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
very
light
alcohol
noticeable
another
winner
from
breweries
that
dont
get
it
wrong
very
often
overall
a
very
nice
effort
by
both
of
these
breweries
i
would
love
to
see
this
make
a
yearly
appearance
o
enjoyable
all
around
but
a
bit
too
thick
and
syrupy
sweet
for
me
to
fall
head
over
heels
for
it
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
really
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
and
one
that
id
buy
again
but
this
style
has
some
phenomenal
varieties
and
this
one
is
right
about
average
between
the
top
and
bottom
which
is
still
a
good
feat
given
that
its
a
collaboration
an
absolute
home
run
for
both
achouffe
and
ommegang
a
quicker
turn
away
from
early
maltiness
and
toward
fruity
dryness
could
make
the
beer
more
drinkable
also
a
more
champagnelike
carbonation
could
better
reinforce
the
vinous
dryness
that
could
improve
an
absolute
gem
of
a
beer
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
orange
citrus
and
lemon
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
orange
and
lemon
notes
as
well
as
some
flowers
possibly
from
the
hops
the
belgian
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
are
also
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
spice
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
peach
infused
golden
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
took
its
time
coming
down
leaving
brokin
globs
of
lace
behind
the
aromas
were
quite
citrusy
with
the
phenols
lending
some
spice
but
they
didnt
overpower
light
spiced
phenols
start
the
ou
in
the
flavor
profile
some
grainy
notesthe
citrusy
hops
really
take
over
about
halfway
and
linger
in
a
nice
finish
i
wouldnt
think
the
alcohol
content
was
so
high
because
it
goes
down
easy
without
any
alcohol
stingits
a
great
food
friendly
beer
overall
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
very
nicely
done
all
around
o
very
nice
belgian
blonde
the
yeast
flavors
are
fantastic
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
lingering
bouquet
of
spices
in
the
finish
overall
its
alright
kinda
like
an
iced
sugar
cookie
topped
with
a
dollop
of
banana
pudding
and
garnished
with
a
bit
of
meyer
lemon
peel
and
cracked
cloves
still
the
sweetness
and
slight
booziness
made
the
eleven
ounces
more
than
enough
for
me
d
all
i
can
say
is
a
very
nice
collaboration
between
ommegang
and
chouffe
great
for
a
warm
summer
eve
the
taste
is
carbonation
and
a
mix
of
yeast
upfront
the
yeast
is
spicy
and
leaves
a
slight
candy
flavor
all
other
flavors
are
subdued
as
the
beer
seems
unbalanced
this
collaboration
brew
hits
the
mark
it
pours
dark
yellow
to
amber
with
a
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
earthy
herb
and
yeast
along
with
some
orange
citrus
and
a
little
cherry
fruit
and
sweet
malt
roil
across
the
tongue
as
it
mixes
with
pepper
and
spice
to
produce
an
authentic
belgian
experience
hints
of
toffee
and
apricot
and
alcohol
the
booze
is
well
hid
but
there
is
a
hint
of
it
underneath
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
belgian
through
and
through
o
this
is
a
great
beer
the
flavors
are
pretty
complex
and
blend
nicely
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
hope
this
isnt
a
onetime
collaboration
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
the
nose
carries
classic
belgian
spices
with
prominent
clove
and
white
pepper
along
others
with
sweet
citrus
peel
the
taste
has
citrus
rich
wheaty
malt
citrus
and
after
it
warms
up
weizen
beer
taste
with
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
classic
belgian
though
a
bit
astrigent
with
the
abv
showing
a
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
my
hangovers
from
la
fin
du
monde
a
fine
belgian
strong
pale
it
is
just
so
bitter
that
it
is
hard
to
sip
this
one
for
me
cheers
o
this
beer
is
delicious
with
a
wellblended
complexity
and
a
supporting
hops
flavor
that
balances
everything
the
noble
hops
and
soft
yeast
funk
blend
well
and
the
crisp
texture
make
this
beer
disappear
much
to
quickly
pours

moderate
golden
color

fair
amount
of

along
with
a
moderate
amount
of
fruity
esters
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
is
chewy
and
bready
a
bit
too
thick
though
still
quite
enjoyable
lots
of
bread
plus
some
mild
fruit
and
a
bit
of
clove
and
spice
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
a
very
solid
brew
that
id
be
happy
to
have
again
o
very
interesting
character
complex
and
balanced
a
little
boozy
but
definitely
abv
notes
nice
surprise
and
collaboration
i
was
hesitant
around
the
notion
of
the
style
and
the
potential
for
this
one
despite
the
reputation
of
both
brewers
but
sure
enough
they
have
crafted
quite
the
quality
strong
golden
ale
serving
type
bottle
oa
solid
beer
used
it
to
celebrate
the
bruins
winning
ommegang
continues
to
make
great
beers
overall
an
expertly
crafted
collaboration
deep
rooted
in
its
belgian
strong
spirit
o
i
dont
care
much
for
this
beer
its
okay
but
nothing
id
ever
drink
again
o
other
than
the
little
hint
of
booze
this
was
pretty
solid
a
nice
belgian
beer
o
two
very
good
breweries
coming
together
to
make
one
very
good
beer
really
like
both
ommegang
and
la
chouffe
and
this
surely
did
not
disappoint
o
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
a
very
good
collaborative
effort
a
nice
collaboration
between
two
great
breweries
aspects
of
both
are
seen
here
carbonation
is
more
ommegang
flavors
are
a
mix
of
both
one
to
get
while
it
lasts
taste
begins
deeply
sweet
cloves
in
the
middle
with
a
fruitiness
peeking
in
and
closes
quietly
with
lingering
of
the
same
flavors
alcohol
warmth
comes
on
as
well
mouthfeel
is
wow
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
esp
for
the
abv
very
nice
brew
a
good
beer
from
two
outstanding
breweries
but
the
alcohol
and
price
could
act
as
a
deterent
for
some
pours
cloudy
light
copper
with
an
inch
of
white
foam
residual
lacing
grips
the
sides
of
the
glass
belgian
yeast
smell
taste
is
smooth
light
sugar
blended
with
an
even
hop
very
mild
and
even
some
honey
taste
and
dark
fruit
very
good
o
remarkable
representation
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
is
typical
of
ommegang
great
brew
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
to
those
yeasty
and
spicy
belgians
a
blend
of
wonderful
caramel
brisk
feel
and
subtle
husky
adjunct
corn
hints
to
a
bubble
golden
pour
nose
of
brie
and
hay
palate
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
i
wouldnt
have
this
in
a
bottle
due
to
fear
of
a
dominating
protein
husk
candy
that
blends
well
but
your
make
for
a
cardboard
feel
if
it
sat
around
too
long
great
little
brew
early
autumn
feel
mild
floral
linger
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
is
a
little
yeasty
for
my
taste
but
i
feel
that
this
will
mellow
with
age
the
hops
are
such
that
they
would
probably
be
conducive
to
to
the
aging
as
well
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
this
beer
would
be
ready
in
about
18
months
or
so
of
cold
aging
at
that
point
hopefully
the
yeast
will
settle
and
the
hops
and
alcohol
would
coexist
a
bit
better
to
make
this
beer
more
drinkable
as
it
is
it
tastes
young
so
it
really
isnt
all
that
enjoyable
didnt
know
what
to
expect
here
nice
pour
honey
gold
color
rests
under
a
two
finger
white
rocky

belgian
lacing
check
head
retention
less
of
a
check
aroma
well
its
weak
a
little
spicy
a
little
banana
and
a
suggestion
of
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
there
are
flavors
of
clove
banana
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
a
very
clean
pils
malt
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
very
esters
are
present
some
green
apple
too
to
think
this
is
almost
10
cant
be
but
it
is
a
really
well
crafted
but
simple
beer
this
makes
it
all
the
more
impressive
these
simple
ales
are
tough
to
pull
off
well
and
this
one
is
a
winner
im
so
tired
of
listing
the
same
handful
of
descriptors
for
each
beer
this
tastes
spicy
sweet
and
a
little
bit
hoppy
if
youve
had
a
strong
bpa
you
know
the
basic
formula
only
wow
it
dont
usually
come
together
like
this
the
sweetness
starts
things
off
then
it
gets
so
nice
and
spicy
in
the
middle
that
burnsbut
it
burns
like
peppers
not
like
alcoholand
then
that
fades
slowly
away
and
leaves
a
taste
of
tangy
honey
upon
your
tongue
and
the
whole
time
the
beers
as
thick
as
silk
appears
a
pale
golden
slightly
clouded
belgian
ale
here
this
is
pretty
much
the
best
american
brewed
belgian
ale
around
owned
by

guessed
it
belgian

aroma
is
spicy
citric
with
hints
of
tropical
fruit
a
very
pleasant
aromatic
experience
as
a
whole

of

very
enticing
with

o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
from
two
breweries
that
i
like
theres
better
beers
out
there
from
both
of
them
but
they
came
together
to
make
a
good
tasting
beer
thats
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
around
great
beer
d
very
drinkable
the
beer
feels
nice
and
complex
and
balanced
from
start
to
end
the

here
is
also
pretty
much

the

of

and

is
really

almost
manages

be

finely

even
though
both

were
used
i
think
the
chouffe
is
more
distinctive
and
noticeable
pretty
smooth
and
drinks
easier
than
a

should
not
a
bad
collab
here
worthy
of
a

higher
carbonation
tingly

this

we
have

noticing

your

garnab
grunted
lightly

carressed
the

no

strong
syrupy
nose
of
molasses
and
raisins
the
oak
is
really
smooth
adds
a
nice
spicey
note
to
the
beer
some
alcohol
but
in
your
face
and
strong
the
taste
is
too
sryupy
raisins
lots
of
char
a
bit
of
vanilla
on
the
finish
worth
trying
better
than
its
parts
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
not
to
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
spices
and
almost
a
wheat
smell
the
taste
had
a
very
strong
spice
taste
in
a
strong
pear
taste
the
taste
was
strong
and
bold
and
the
alchool
while
not
noticable
did
make
a
hit
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
was
just
expecting
more
overall
lovely
and
rich
brew
from
ommegang
and
chouffe
highly
recommended
for
a
special
occasion
d
a
good
belgian
this
is
definitely
the
brew
youre
looking
for
if
you
like
this
style
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
would
i
have
this
beer
again
sure
very
tasty
and
an
appealing
overall
this
beer
is
everything
it
promises
in
the
long
run
a
strong
belgian
pale
that
produces
the
lasting
flavor
and
feel
that
they
have
for
years
and
years
cheers
o
great
beer
i
probably
wont
seek
it
again
but
i
rather
enjoyed
trying
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
yeast
flavors
are
very
strong
id
like
to
see
it
toned
back
so
that
the
juiciness
of
the
fruity
hops
can
shine
pours
a
lightly
hazed
and
bubbly
golden
yellow
pillow
of
soft
white
head
scent
is
pale
light
watery
and
sweet
fruits
belgian
yeasts
and
faint
hints
of
bread
and
spice
taste
slightly
more
aggressive
then
scent
watery
and
sweet
fruits
are
the
start
apple
citrus
and
tropical
all
present
malt
is
lightly
sweet
and
bready
standard
belgian
yeast
notes
in
moderation
some
spice
medium
bodied
smooth
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
hides
its
abvs
very
well
d
quite
drinkable
and
look
forward
to
another
if
i
can
find
it
d
wonderfully
drinkable
overall
a
tremendous
collaboration
brew
highly
recommended
excellent
especially
for
style
an
incredibly
delicious
brew
and
one
id
defiintely
have
again
o
decent
beer
though
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
individual
parts
as
opposed
to
the
sum
in
this
case
nice
to
try
but
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
if
not
for
the
accumulation
this
would
be
an
a
or
a
beer
imo
possibly
tastes
better
on
draft
or
soon
after
bottling
a
collaboration
ale
that
actually
lives
up
to
the
billing
o
a
really
surprising
beer
as
collaborations
tend
to
be
either
spectacular
successes
or
letdowns
this
one
works
really
well
with
a
very
interesting
complex
brew
that
puts
a
heavyhitting
twist
on
the
style
o
a
good
beer
overall
and
among
the
better
bspas
out
there
the
main
drawback
of
this
beer
other
than
the
price
is
the
obvious
alcohol
presence
while
its
not
super
hot
i
feel
like
the
best
versions
of
the
style
hide
it
better
overall
this
is
a
win
for
everybody
involved
a
great
example
of
style
and
another
successful
collaboration
lets
hope
we
see
more
of
these
guys
in
the
future
pours
a
clear
carbonated
yellow
with
a
half
finger
of
white
foam
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
very
typical
belgian
nose
lots
of
clove
phenol
and
maybe
a
hint
of
banana
at
the
end
the
taste
matches
the
nose
fairly
closely
with
clove
and
a
nice
sweetness
at
the
end
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
overall
a
nice
tasty
belgian
d
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
but
an
excellent
rare
collab
to
stumble
upon
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
cant
see
myself
getting
it
again
due
to
the
fact
it
was
a
once
time
release
great
collaboration
however
very
drinkable
and
light
for
9
5
abv
i
was
able
to
patiently
finish
off
the
bomber
without
too
much
struggle
or
too
much
of
a
buzz
overall
brilliant
absolutely
brilliant
i
didnt
pick
this
up
at
first
but
now
im
glad
that
i
did
i
do
not
recall
being
this
positive
on
an
ommegang
beer
since
i
first
had
three
philosphers
that
is
really
saying
something
because
3
phils
is
one
of
my
sentimental
favs
the
cpj
o
fantastic
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
thanks
to
the
perfectly
executed
carbonation
well
done
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
heat
being
noticeable
excellent
offering
that
should
age
very
well
o
doesnt
taste
a
hint
near
9
5
but
is
a
new
favorite
yet
it
is
a
limited
edition
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
rather
fruity
equal
parts
applepear
and
lemon
not
too
sweet
with
a
malty
underpinning
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
it
not
persistent
white
head
refreshing
flavor
is
fruity
and
malty
having
tones
of
apple
and
butterscotch
a
little
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
fairly
strong
alcohol
bite
ragged
fizzy
texture
has
a
good
edge
and
leaves
a
persistent
tingle
with
some
fruitiness
and
maltiness
as
well
as
a
nip
of
alcohol
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
killer
yeast
nose
that
compliments
a
solid
pale
malt
base
its
fruity
with
a
touch
of
funk
along
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
silky
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
thats
light
and
easy
drinking
with
little
alcohol
warmth
the
yeast
provides
a
ton
of
character
and
adds
a
good
deal
of
depth
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
im
a
huge
fan
of
collaborations
and
this
one
is
no
exception
on
tap
at
a
grill
in
clarendon
va
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
tanblonde
color
with
a
heavy
haze
and
some
light
brown
sediment
floating
around
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
on
top
there
is
an
off
white
cap
of
foam
that
slowly
settles
and
makes
some
nice
slick
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
big
classic
belgian
yeast
character
coming
to
the
nose
with
it
comes
fruit
funk
and
wet
hay
mixed
with
some
sweet
bready
malt
and
solid
notes
of
floralspicy
hops
it
starts
with
a
nice
base
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
yeast
with
a
light
touch
of
funk
and
wet
hay
inside
this
are
some
nice
fruity
notes
as
well
and
i
get
white
wine
grapes
light
unripe
peach
and
mild
orange
blossom
this
is
all
backed
up
by
a
firm
floral
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
that
adds
a
pleasant
balance
and
dryness
to
the
finish
its
well
balanced
on
the
palate
and
fun
to
drink
overall
it
is
an
outstanding
belgian
which
to
me
seems
to
fits
somewhere
between
a
blond
and
a
triple
also
of
note
here
is
the
very
well
hidden
9
5
abv
went
extremely
well
with
the
grilled
burger
and
asparagus
i
ordered
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
and
felt
pretty
balanced
overall
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
d
this
was
a
very
nice
bspa
with
clean
and
balanced
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
fantastic
and
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
definitely
recommended
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
a
really
awesome
beer
is
the
alcoholic
heat
could
be
a
touch
rounder
with
the
alcohol
but
id
still
rock
this
beer
again
for
sure
o
wow
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
most
complex
fulfilling
brews
ive
ever
had
even
at
15
per
750
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
for
aging
pronto
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
traditional
ommegang
fair
will
have
to
try
more
le
chouffe
to
know
what
i
taste
in
the
yeast
here
nice
spices
in
the
taste
despite
a
weaker
scent
dont
need
many
of
these
though
what
they
did
here
is
still
very
enjoyable
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
never
noticed
the
alcohol
still
this
is
overall
a
great
high
quality
beer
that
deserves
a
try

a
very
nice
belgium
ale
with
characteristics
of
both
breweries
involved
in
this
collaboration
the
last
few
beers
i
have
had
from
ommegang
have
not
met
my
expectations
i
fear
that
have
they
have
increased
output
they
have
decreased
in
quality
well
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
not
sure
where
the
9
5
abv
is
i
cant
taste
it
recommended
as
a
very
good
collaboration
beer
would
have
been
nice
to
taste
more
of
the
chouffe
though
overall
excited
to
try
this
one
and
wasnt
let
down
great
aroma
taste
and
drinkability
the
only
negative
was
the
lack
of
head
dont
really
know
what
happened
there
others
seemed
to
get
better
results
and
i
dont
usually
have
issues
pouring
a
nice
head
on
the
beer
jd
despite
the
misleading
gnomenclature
gnomegang
is
a
beer
that
stands
quite
tall
i
had
high
hopes
that
brasserie
d
achouffe
and
brewery
ommegang
would
come
up
with
a
winner
they
did
indeed
theres
really
not
much
to
criticize
here
this
is
a
damn
good
belgian
strong
pale
that
can
run
with
the
best
of
them
the
hops
are
an
interesting
twist
and
really
add
a
lot
to
the
mix
great
stuff
find
a
bottle
if
you
havent
already
interesting
beer
but
i
will
probably
not
buy
it
again
instead
sticking
with
my
favorites
of
each
brewery
hennepin
from
ommegang
houblon
ipa
triple
from
dachouffe
the
beer
is
good
not
amazing
its
missing
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
it
was
a
little
thin
perhaps
overall
decent
beer
at
6
in
the
bar
not
worth
it
at
10
d
lots
of
yeast
character
as
expected
with
anything
choufferelated
i
like
the
spicy
complexity
of
the
yeast
as
it
works
very
well
with
the
rich
bready
malt
character
there
is
some
hop
character
but
not
quite
as
much
as
it
seems
like
there
should
be
especially
considering
how
thick
the
malt
character
is
the
finish
is
a
bit
of
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
however
and
this
holds
the
beer
back
a
bit
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
though
as
far
a
belgianamerican
collaborations
go
it
is
still
second
to
the
green
flashst
feuillien
strong
golden
ale
i
love
this
earthy
rustic
spicy
fruity
all
things
i
love
in
belgian
pale
ale
sip
and
savor
this
is
a
great
one
something
i
highly
recommend
poured
out
of
the
bottle
as
a
lightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
no
head
retention
with
basically
no
lacing
banana
and
clove
aroma
on
the
nose
same
flavors
in
the
taste
plus
some
citrus
too
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
little
bitey
overall
i
really
liked
this
beers
taste
and
smell
i
found
it
to
be
rather
enjoyable
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
some
day
o
with
the
high
caliber
of
the
two
breweries
involved
i
expected
more
from
this
collaboration
but
this
beer
really
needs
polishing
also
i
suggest
drinking
this
pretty
cool
as
it
gets
much
too
boozy
as
it
warms
one
of
the
best
bpa
ive
tried
even
better
than
ommegangs
other
fine
offering
thanks
ommegang
and
dachouffe
for
a
fantastic
belgium
blonde
overall
very
tasty
but
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
over
the
other
b
pales
and
not
worth
the
14
cost
o
hands
down
best
blonde
ale
i
have
had
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
really
great
i
was
not
as
impressed
as
i
had
hoped
but
a
good
beer
d
as
i
work
through
this
magnum
the
9
5
abv
becomes
more
and
more
evident
this
beer
has
a
warming
affect
as
far
as
drinkabilityrepeatability
my
bias
enters
into
this
as
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
also
i
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
im
questioning
repeatability
after
25
4
ounces
not
12
with
that
in
mind
id
score
this
as
a
3
5
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
phenolic
and
hoppy
wouldve
liked
it
in
smaller
quantities
overall
i
just
wish
it
didnt
finish
with
that
bitter
orange
taste
otherwise
it
would
be
top
notch
a
very
fruity
fairly
hoppy
complex
bspa
overall
really
a
nice
interpretation
that
hits
all
the
major
flavor
profiles
but
a
touch
heavy
on
the
the
alcohol
flavor
ooverall
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
i
enjoyed
it
with
the
seafood
and
cigars
that
i
had
with
it
o
overall
this
was
a
above
average
beer
it
seems
like
this
was
a
one
off
release
that
should
be
made
into
rotation
the
abv
was
there
in
the
beer
the
entire
time
although
it
never
became
overwhelming
a
nice
drinker
that
i
was
glad
to
have
a
couple
glasses
of
overall
i
definatly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
fell
just
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
from
2
highly
regarded
breweries
i
most
likely
will
not
buy
this
again
mainly
because
of
the
price
on
tap
at
the
dive
bar
in
worcester
for
7
served
in
an
ommegang
tulip
glass
bright
yellow
body
with
a
bit
of
orangey
haze
to
it
small
white
head
and
spritzy
carbonation
smell
was
floral
and
citruslike
and
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
saison
taste
was
very
refreshing
lots
of
notes
of
coriander
lemon
and
belgian
sugar
mouthfeel
was
tart
and
crisp
a
great
beer
for
the
style
with
an
abv
that
is
well
hidden
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
a
try
ommegang
does
not
make
many
duds
and
this
one
continues
their
winning
ways
notes
overall
it
is
an
outstanding
belgian
which
to
me
seems
to
fits
somewhere
between
a
blond
and
a
triple
also
of
note
here
is
the
very
well
hidden
9
5
abv
when
i
pulled
the
cork
i
noticed
that
the
beer
was
not
as
aggressively
carbonated
as
duvel
the
benchmark
of
the
style
the
body
was
also
noticed
to
be
more
cloudy
and
with
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
yellow
than
the
pale
golden
color
that
other
bspas
typically
display
the
smell
was
grassy
and
floral
typical
of
the
style
the
taste
was
very
lemony
with
floral
and
spicy
hop
notes
the
middle
was
dry
and
the
tartness
lasted
into
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
warmed
up
some
banana
and
tropical
fruit
flavors
started
to
show
up
this
was
not
as
funky
as
hennepin
but
was
closer
to
that
flavor
profile
than
bspas
like
duvel
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
lighter
than
medium
and
carbonation
was
soft
and
not
overly
aggressive
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
warming
finish
surprising
a
hybrid
that
tastes
more
like
a
cohesive
whole
o
a
good
collaboration
and
another
winner
from
ommegang
these
guys
are
slowly
becoming
a
favorite
drinkabilityoverall
strong
drink
all
day
long
i
could
drink
this
one
its
a
tad
expensive
for
the
beer
is
worth
it
it
was
nice
and
soft
with
a
yeasty
fizzy
note
appears
a
hazy
lite
golden
pale
orange
little
bit
of
a
white
thin
head
aroma
is
ok
a
little
spice
and
yeast
flavors
of
ripe
bananas
bubblegum
spices
and
clean
citrus
just
another
great
beer
from
ommegang
a
good
crisp
mouthfeel
with
the
great
belgian
yeast
leading
the
way
in
every
sip
be
carefull
of
this
one
its
an
easy
drinker
and
the
high
abv
will
catch
up
with
you
as
the
booze
is
hardly
noticeable
it
the
sips
its
also
a
strong
but
not
too
heavy
or
thick
spicy
pale
belgian
with
mild
berry
fruit
notes
over
dry
biscuit
malts
and
a
balancing
touch
of
hops
for
this
price
there
are
plenty
of
other
beers
id
rather
try
however
its
worth
the
sacrifice
of
hard
earned
dough
to
try
a
collaboration
between
two
serious
breweries
to
my
unfortunate
displeasure
his
beer
tries
to
overpower
with
a
more
than
fortified
9
5abv
i
would
have
liked
a
beer
for
less
cash
and
more
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
with
carbonation
thats
so
low
its
almost
watery
a
medium
body
and
a
nice
little
bite
after
it
slides
over
the
tongue
really
nice
flavorful
beer
that
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
want
to
say
the
beer
is
very
hennepin
and
the
hype
was
greater
than
the
beer
itself
not
bad
however
a
nice
beer
overall
but
not
one
i
would
need
to
have
again
there
just
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
wowing
me
worth
a
try
but
dont
have
too
high
of
expectations
drinkability
at
the
moment
soso
its
very
heavy
almost
cloyingly
sweet
and
absolutely
dominated
by
yeast
flavors
i
think
a
year
in
the
cellar
to
dry
and
blend
the
flavors
would
do
this
one
wonders
i
just
thought
they
could
have
done
more
to
cover
up
the
everlooming
abv
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
that
still
somehow
manages
to
be
light
and
extremely
quaffable
crisp
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
hints
of
zesty
spice
estery
light
fruit
breadyeast
pale
malt
alcohol
and
pale
malt
hints
of
zesty
spice
up
front
especially
pepper
and
clove
linger
throughout
but
are
countered
by
hints
of
banana
apple
pear
and
citrus
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
adds
some
sweetness
but
this
is
countered
by
faint
bitterness
from
the
earthy
grassy
hops
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
complex
and
tasty
beer
recommended
this
is
an
overall
easy
to
drink
brew
that
is
quite
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
get
another
bottle
d
these
two
breweries
nailed
it
with
this
one
great
easy
drinking
beer
no
sign
of
the
booze
could
have
drank
this
all
night
long
d
great
belgian
pale
duvel
is
still
the
tops
but
this
is
a
great
showing
from
a
stateside
brewery
that
knows
their
shit
d
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
not
in
love
with
the
price
how
is
something
made
less
than
2
hours
from
me
cost
the
same
as
something
coming
from
belgium
a
nice
example
still
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
though
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
refreshing
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
just
a
good
beer
all
together
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
the
beer
appears
hazy
and
golden
yellow
hued
with
14
of
head
and
decent
lacing
left
on
the
chalice
the
aroma
brings
apples
yeast
alcohol
cider
grapes
and
white
wine
flavor
brings
much
of
the
same
along
with
a
subtle
alcoholic
sweetness
the
feel
is
pretty
good
with
a
lasting
quality
of
alcoholic
apple
cider
overall
a
decent
brew
o
yummy
take
on
this
awesome
style
great
collaboration
gnomegang
pours
a
halfway
cloudy
tangerine
though
it
gets
as
light
as
lemon
yellow
depending
on
the
lighting
the
frothy
white
crown
comes
up
to
being
three
fingers
tall
head
retention
is
just
average
for
the
style
and
lacing
is
a
bit
short
of
top
notch
examples
the
nose
is
a
spot
on
blend
of
pearsgranny
smith
apples
hebal
and
spicy
hop
notes
and
more
intense
pepper
and
clove
phenols
that
balance
gets
lost
on
my
palate
though
as
a
the
phenolichop
notes
take
over
just
a
tad
too
much
for
the
beer
to
be
great
the
hop
bitterness
is
dialed
in
perfectly
to
mark
the
transition
from
fruity
flavors
to
the
other
and
theres
also
just
a
hint
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
that
blends
in
nicely
to
the
finish
the
beer
just
finishes
too
phenolic
and
dry
even
for
a
bspa
for
my
taste
given
that
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
superb
the
mouthfeel
is
the
body
is
light
for
such
a
potent
beer
yet
maintains
enough
of
a
backbone
to
stand
up
to
all
the
flavors
that
make
up
the
beer
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
cuts
through
everything
like
a
knife
without
becoming
obtrusive
the
bubbles
feel
very
smallfine
and
precise
on
my
tongue
and
as
a
result
i
dont
think
id
change
anything
about
the
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
more
balance
in
the
flavor
department
and
gnomegang
would
be
world
class
but
as
it
is
its
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
notes
and
a
spicy
cinnamon
in
the
taste
earthy
spicy
and
a
big
cinnamon
presence
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
spice
in
the
aftertaste
quite
spicy
but
nice
earthiness
to
balance
it
out
overall
i
cant
say
that
i
loved
this
beer
the
aftertaste
bugged
me
and
the
hops
and
spice
from
the
yeast
didnt
seem
to
get
along
all
that
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
for
me
di
was
glad
to
find
this
on
tap
with
out
having
to
buy
a
bomber
to
try
it
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
a
very
strong
witbier
the
abv
does
hit
quickly
and
makes
it
more
difficult
to
finish
i
think
they
couldve
made
this
a
bit
lighter
and
it
would
be
a
spectacular
belgian
for
the
summer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
augustijn
grand
cru
had
a
few
kegs
of
grand
cru
to
make
the
comparison
spicy
and
dry
if
you
like
dry
belgian
ales
this
one
will
not
dissappoint
the
floral
mouthfeel
and
occasional
desire
for
insane
abv
are
the
only
reasons
i
havent
gone
100
german
with
my
beer
choices
beer
is
thinner
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
very
flavorful
nice
body
nice
carbonation
good
breadiness
to
it
the
yeast
fill
otu
the
midpalate
nicely
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
wont
have
more
ill
just
drink
la
fin
du
monde
this
bottle
was
shared
with
a
fellow
ba
last
night
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
vibrant
gold
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
aromas
was
quite
impressive
and
varied
it
gave
off
pale
malt
sweetness
honey
yeast
some
spice
cloves
and
light
floral
hops
almost
like
hibiscus
even
the
taste
was
superb
it
was
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
perfectly
blended
flavors
the
spices
light
hops
floral
aspects
yeast
cloves
and
honey
all
blended
so
perfectly
i
was
blown
away
its
probably
the
best
tasting
belgian
strong
pale
ive
had
since
the
first
time
i
opened
a
bruery
mischief
but
better
it
drank
light
and
left
a
nice
yeasty
spicy
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
top
notch
representation
of
the
style
im
really
glad
we
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
the
alcohol
only
really
appears
in
the
finish
clove
flavors
get
slightly
more
aggressive
as
the
beer
warms
but
nothing
too
crazy
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
not
much
into
pale
ales
but
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
being
of
the
belgian
persuasion
glad
i
did
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
because
it
is
still
a
little
bitter
for
my
taste
but
definitely
worth
the
try
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
one
of
my
new
favorites
it
has
some
amazing
qualities
that
i
love
in
beers
defiantly
makes
me
what
more
im
going
to
have
to
head
back
to
the
store
tomorrow
and
see
if
there
are
some
more
very
drinkable
the
higher
abv
9
5
is
well
done
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
like
belgian
ales
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
recedes
to
skim
and
leaves
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
along
with
yeast
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
clove
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweet
yeast
backbone
along
with
some
citrus
flavors
up
front
in
the
middle
is
the
clove
presence
the
noble
hops
come
through
at
the
end
to
round
out
the
beer
not
a
big
hop
bite
but
a
nice
mellow
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
slickness
the
overall
is
good
very
solid
nice
inviting
aroma
and
solid
flavor
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
with
just
a
hint
being
shown
in
the
mouthfeel
o
an
excellent
collaboration
that
was
quite
tasty
excellent
beer
good
flavor
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
higher
abv
overall
pretty
good
nothing
wrong
tasty
little
boozy
overall
i
will
seek
more
this
is
fantastic
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
blondes
i
have
had
o
great
beer
definitely
up
in
the
ranks
of
top
belgians
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
on
tap
since
my
love
for
brasserie
d
achouffe
and
occasional
interest
in
ommegang
had
me
eying
the
bottle
but
until
now
ive
balked
at
buying
it
now
im
planning
on
buying
a
bottle
and
saving
it
in
case
i
get
a
chance
to
seduce
someone
in
a
forest
d
other
than
the
unpleasant
smell
this
is
pretty
solid
better
than
tramp
stamp
in
any
case
id
try
it
ontap
to
see
if
the
smell
is
from
bottle
shock
i
am
extra
skeptical
of
these
collaborations
these
days
but
this
beer
goes
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
and
created
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
more
than
comparable
products
from
either
brewer
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
i
always
thought
la
chouffe
was
fantastic
best
new
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
while
highly
recommended
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
kudos
to
ommegang
for
making
this
one
its
not
my
favorite
in
its
class
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
this
limited
release
cheers
long
hoppy
spicy
dry
finish
very
satisfying
brew
the
gnomes
came
through
d
outstanding
for
the
mouthfeel
and
solid
all
around
i
will
be
going
to
buy
another
one
or
two
of
these
soon
o
i
am
impressed
i
love
a
good
bspa
and
this
is
one
that
should
not
be
missed
worth
seeking
out
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
supersmooth
and
very
flavorfull
get
some
while
you
can
worth
every
penny
a
superbly
welldone
collaboration
poured
a
clear
orange
gold
w
small
head
and
not
much
lace
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
perks
up
w
citric
notes
spice
yeast
some
sugary
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
sourness
a
very
crisp
clean
blonde
that
is
somehow
light
in
body
yet
smooth
chewey
a
little
sticky
as
well
in
the
mouthfeel
im
getting
all
kinds
of
balanced
tastes
such
as
breadiness
and
crisp
carbonation
and
some
bitter
hops
for
dryness
and
yet
im
also
picking
up
fruit
flavors
that
range
from
sour
citric
to
grape
to
plush
fruit
like
apple
and
pear
and
also
sweetness
from
caramel
sugar
and
sweet
fruit
plus
a
pickup
from
spices
and
the
abv
is
rather
well
hidden
though
it
combined
w
the
spices
bring
a
little
hotness
to
the
finish
nothing
major
pleasantly
surprised
that
none
of
this
is
muddled
and
this
is
a
great
collabo
served
from
tap
into
a
snifter
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
slight
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
the
banana
aspect
going
on
in
this
one
was
quite
pleasant
and
enjoyable
when
this
was
coupled
with
the
slight
heat
from
the
alcohol
it
was
quite
nice
the
aroma
was
very
good
too
and
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
this
one
was
pretty
good
in
just
about
all
aspects
definitely
would
suggest
this
to
other
bas
and
friends
as
it
is
a
must
try
o
the
ale
doesnt
feel
like
a
9
5
beast
instead
the
swirling
flavors
are
comforting
and
brilliant
hands
down
the
best
brewer
of
belgianstyle
ales
in
the
u
s
had
this
on
tap
at
the
blue
monk
in
buffalo
pours
a
straw
to
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasted
to
the
bottom
the
aroma
was
mostly
belgian
yeast
with
hints
of
citrus
and
honey
the
mouthfeel
was
that
wonderful
belgian
creaminess
the
flavor
was
a
smooth
balance
of
belgian
yeast
bready
malts
and
hints
of
lemon
and
honey
it
had
a
very
tasty
bready
aftertaste
that
lasted
if
this
is
what
the
two
breweries
can
produce
when
getting
together
then
they
should
do
so
more
often
o
excellent
effort
this
might
just
reignite
my
interest
in
ommegang
overall
another
winner
from
the
ommegang
brewery
cant
go
wrong
with
them
ever
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
to
seek
out
d
low
drinkability
o
i
wanted
to
try
this
the
moment
i
heard
about
it
and
i
only
regret
i
did
not
buy
two
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
wonderful
flavor
and
it
is
pretty
balanced
it
has
sweetness
but
it
also
has
hops
it
is
smooth
and
delightful
i
plan
on
buying
another
one
notes
enjoyable
bspa
a
little
heavy
on
the
spicy
but
a
sweet
malthoney
provides
a
bit
of
balance
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
for
the
style
drinkabilityoveralleasily
goes
down
and
superbly
crafted
an
excellent
collaboration
attempt
my
hats
off
to
both
ommegang
and
chouffe
for
this
excellent
team
effort
o
hides
the
9
well
taste
is
great
a
little
too
sweet
to
really
throw
back
but
pairs
fantastic
with
sweet
spicy
pulled
pork
which
i
just
so
happen
to
be
eating
d
a
great
beer
im
seeing
the
price
is
going
to
be
around
15
for
the
750
which
is
pushing
it
but
youll
get
quality
believe
me
yumm
id
have
to
think
long
and
hard
to
recall
an
ommegang
beer
ive
liked
more
than
this
very
impressive
o
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
ommegang
brewery
in
many
ways
im
really
surprised
that
this
categorized
as
a
bspa
since
it
screams
saison
in
every
way
except
for
the
abv
way
more
earthy
and
grassy
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
with
the
collaboration
it
makes
sense
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
youd
be
happier
with
a
bottle
of
hennepin
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
d
really
drinkable
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
despite
the
bitterness
too
bad
its
pretty
limited
not
to
mention
pretty
expensive
at
sapsuckers
at
25
a
bottle
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
bspas
ive
had
in
long
while
drinkable
oh
yes
a
very
enjoyable
brew
by
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
spot
on
flavors
well
balanced
it
could
be
a
bit
more
dry
and
crisp
will
be
stocking
up
on
a
few
more
of
these
and
at
13
99
a
bottle
you
cant
go
wrong
get
them
while
you
can
they
are
a
limited
release
and
will
probably
go
fast
more
head
retention
and
better
lacing
would
have
been
appreciated
but
the
excellent
flavor
smell
and
mouthfeel
definitely
made
up
for
that
highly
drinkable
complex
without
being
cloying
this
is
one
you
can
savor
or
share
with
friends
what
a
great
beer
cmon
this
one
is
two
good
to
be
a
one
off
gonna
stock
up
on
a
few
bottles
belgian
lovers
go
get
some
and
enjoy
overall
it
is
a
solid
fruity
bspa
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
the
collaboration
seems
to
have
gotten
it
right
with
an
absolutely
great
mouthfeel
and
flavor
very
wellrounded
and
balanced
nothing
less
than
you
would
expect
from
the
two
breweries
involved
a
pity
this
is
a
onetime
release
but
maybe
well
get
lucky
and
theyll
bring
it
back
again

a

box
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
its
counterpart
pours
a
stunning
dark
golden
color
with
just
a
faint
haze
the
aroma
is
muted
but
smells
vaguely
of
yeast
and
lees
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
grape
to
it
subtle
floral
elements
and
a
belgian
yeast
funk
alcohol
is
kept
at
bay
for
the
most
part
and
this
is
a
refreshing
option
full
bodied
well
carbonated
feel
with
a
slight
dryness
overall
this
is
a
good
ale
but
seems
to
lack
direction
in
the
smell
and
taste
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
the
presence
of
the
grapes
is
immediately
noticeable
but
yet
not
overwhelming
in
every
aspect
of
the
beer
a
great
use
of
subtle
yeast
and
hop
profiles
to
compliment
the
grape
flavors
in
the
forefront
very
smooth
creamy
medium
body
with
medium
high
very
finely
bubbled
carbonation
damn
fine
beer
looks
great
in
the
glass
billowing

and
thick

theres
just
the
perfect
amount
of
funk
to
the
nose
and
taste
wonderful
sweet
vinegar
presence
as
well
as
dark
ripe
fruit
plums
come
to
mind
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
would
appeal
to
most
anyone
great
entry
to
sours
for
the
novice
and
enough
complexity
for
the
purist
wonderful
brew
very
pale
like
a
witbier
with
billowing
head
has
a
little
funkybarnyard
smell
but
overall
the
scents
are
subtle
it
has
a
very
well
balanced
taste
profile
you
get
a
touch
of
sour
some
funk
a
little
sweetness
a
little
booziness
and
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
9
brew
and
has
alot
going
on
it
didnt
quite
give
me
the
wow
factor
but
its
definitely
at
that
level
just
on
the
cusp
of
a
world
class
brew
but
not
quite
there
allagash
makes
another
very
solid
outstanding
beer
overall
i
felt
the
grape
was
far
too
prominent
and
the
beer
was
far
too
sweet
this
combination
just
didnt
work
well
for
my
tastes
it
is
wellmade
but
not
one
i
have
to
have
the
sweetness
masks
the
alcohol
on
this
well
but
also
slightly
overpowers
the
beer
o
well
crafted
but
with
a
strange
somewhat
ambivalent
flavor
profile
m
medium
or
so
between
fairly
drinkable
and
almost
sipper
a
pretty
decent
and
unique
that
i
will
probably
pick
up
again
if
i
can
find
it
on
sale
overall
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
the
grapes
add
some
nice
additional
complexity
without
overwhelming
the
base
beer
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
and
flavorful
belgianstyle
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
fruit
sweetness
really
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
will
happily
drink
again

poured
with
a
barely
there
white
head
on
a
clear
yellow
body
mild
carbonation
was
visible
in
the
body
the
nose
had
a
hint
of
tartness
and
this
is
where
the
chardonnay
grapes
became
apparent
on
the
taste
it
definitely
had
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
to
it
which
was
quite
tasty
the
grapes
were
also
very
apparent
in
the
taste
but
not
cloying
or
overly
sweet
the
sweetness
was
just
enough
to
be
pleasant
the
mild
carbonation
really
complemented
the
lighter
than
expected
body
i
also
got
hints
of
pear
and
apricot
as
i
sipped
more
on
the
brew
the
finish
was
quick
and
sweet
what
also
surprised
me
was
how
high
the
booze
was
on
this
bad
boy
it
was
completely
and
totally
hidden
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
b
to
me
this
came
off
almost
as
an
attempt
of
cloning
or
at
least
imitating
a
temptation
or
damnation
and
while
decent
in
its
own
right
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
those
two
o
delicious
interesting
and
complex
with
a
simple
dominating
chardonnay

presence
pairs
amazingly
with

but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
from
allagash
just
not
worth
anywhere
near
the
19
99
price
tag
for
it
in
ma
overall
this
is
not
a
particularly
complex
or
interesting
beer
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
great
pairing
for
poultry
or
cheese
i
am
a
big
fan
of
belgianstyle
pale
ales
and
i
think
this
is
a
superb
one
at
9
it
is
not
so
strong
as
some
other
bpas
this
beer
would
be
a
good
low
alcohol
substitute
for
a
1415
chardonnay
and
you
could
definitely
use
this
to
wean
a
white
wine
drinker
into
beer
aging
has
not
hurt
it
i
think
ill
buy
a
few
more
and
lay
them
down
for
a
couple
years
it
is
a
bit
pricey
at
around
18
but
it
is
as
worthy
in
mho
as
cantillon
lambics
made
with
white
grapes
which
i
also
adore
this
is
taking
a
belgian
golden
ale
in
the
same
direction
but
with
a
bigger
malt
body
and
nice
creamy
carbonation
that
is
a
great
meld
of
a
golden
ale
and
grapes
do
drinkability
is
high
as
a
fairly
avid
wine
drinker
as
an
active
beer
advocate
though
my
love
for
beer
far
transcends
that
of
wine
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
hybrid
between
the
two
alcohols
it
starts
with
an
aggressive
grape
note
but
from
the
middle
to
finish
the
beer
has
time
to
develop
its
own
complexities
and
flavors
so
overall
i
dont
feel
one
side
dominates
over
the
other
i
could
see
someone
who
doesnt
enjoy
wine
especially
white
wines
not
particularly
enjoying
this
beer
as
the
start
of
the
beer
and
the
dry
finish
is
ripped
directly
from
white
wine
but
those
who
enjoy
white
wine
could
definitely
jump
into
this
beer
overall
good
but
yeah
not
for
17
d
overall
this
beer
drank
well
i
think
it
could
have
used
a
bit
less
of
the
leathery
smell
and
taste
could
have
used
more
lemony
or
spicy
flavor
to
it
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
would
pass
on
the
next
one
at
the
price
point
there
are
better
things
to
buy
for
the
money
still
quite
good
jd
o
not
really
my
thing
reminded
me
too
much
of
the
dfh
ancient
ales
that
use
grape
juice
and
honey
once
youve
had
one
of
those
they
all
kinda
taste
the
same
owould
not
order
this
again
unless
i
was
assured
this
was
a
suboptimal
batch
sampled
on
june
3
2011
at
the
american
craft
beer
festival
it
had
a
kind
of
pale
yellowolive
pour
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
had
a
hint
of
grape
but
more
of
a
yeast
and
spice
note
the
taste
also
had
a
vague
green
grape
flavor
with
a
nice
spicy
and
malty
character
overall
a
beer
that
is
worth
having
again
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
actually
like
how
the
flavor
and
aroma
change
as
the
beer
warms
us
especially
since
nothing
about
it
ever
gets
onedimensional
i
actually
think
that
i
like
this
beer
a
little
better
than
the
victor
which
is
a
little
surprising
for
me
as
i
typically
favor
the
darker
side
of
things
but
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
overall
if
you
like
dupont
moinette
blond
i
dont
think
that
you
would
be
disappointed
in
this
beer
as
they
share
some
characteristics
in
hops
especially
d
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
from
this
beer
especially
at
18
per
bottle
it
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
the
victor
ale
from
the
same
brewery
but
the
basic
taste
is
dissapointingly
similar
i
would
not
buy
another
one
of
these
bottles
especially
at
this
price
try
it
if
you
want
but
dont
say
i
didnt
warn
you
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
drink
well
goes
down
easily
although
the
grapes
tend
to
wear
on
you
after
a
while
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
yummy
the
nose
had
a
ton
of
green
grapes
in
it
the
flavor
was
very
spicy
and
dry
like
a
chardonnay
i
never
thought
i
use
that
word
in
a
review
it
has
a
light
feel
to
it
with
all
kinds
of
carbonation
it
was
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
allagash
doesnt
really
stand
out
much
from
other
allagash
offerings
but
its
not
bad
id
go
with
curieux
or
just
the
white
before
getting
this
again
though
d
not
what
id
call
my
favorite
allagash
beer
but
its
undeniably
drinkable
very
nice
flavor
the
grapes
are
used
well
the
carbonation
grasps
at
the
tongue
thrusting
grape
and
malt
and
some
well
hidden
alcohol
into
its
cavities
medium
dry
surprised
this
actually
isnt
sweeter
the
finish
is
outstanding
this
is
impressive
d
drinks
like
a
chardonnay
but
theres
a
lower
abv
than
the
actual
wine
counterpart
so
i
suppose
this
is
good
for
drinkability
no
alcohol
is
present
at
all
even
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
great
light
body
which
is
dangerous
for
the
abv
for
what
its
worth
not
exactly
cheap
though
pours
a
shade
of
gold
with
a
white
head
nose
brings
some
wood
spice
grape
and
some
stone
fruits
the
taste
is
quite
taken
over
by
the
grapes
taking
away
some
of
the
noses
nuances
feel
is
somewhat
dry
drinks
okay
but
like
with
the
victor
i
think
the
grapes
ended
up
being
too
large
a
component
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
i
liked
the
complexity
the
grapes
added
and
they
also
didnt
overpower
the
beer
a
very
cool
and
well
made
beer
much
like
a
good
bottle
of
wine
the
9
00abv
is
very
nicely
hidden
the
taste
is
a
touch
too
sweet
to
get
a
perfect
score
here
but
it
is
still
definitely
drinkable
grab
one
if
you
have
the
chance
its
a
different
kind
of
beer
for
sure
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
super
cool
cross
over
between
beer
and
wine
i
like
not
going
to
write
too
much

wrote
the
most
insanely
impressive

his
is

check
that
out
in
any
case
this
was
a
nice

beer
that
didnt
quite
reach
the
heights
of
the
interlude
but
all
very
light
and
soft
perfectly
balanced
in
an
orchestra
of
musical
flavor
allagash
won
the
game
for
me
with
this
one

by

i
was
about
ready
to
move
on
to
something

giving
this

transitions
to

lots

and
medium

overall
if
the
price
tag
of
20
bucks
wasnt
so
ridiculous
id
definitely
get
this
again
nice
fruity
red
grape
flavors
balanced
by
a
dry
and
slighty
tart
finish
definitely
worth
a
try
even
for
those
who
dont
like
fruitier
beer
since
its
so
balanced
lightly
hazy
deep
straw
with
hints
of
purple
fruity
earthy
spicy
aromas
and
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a

edge
to
it
interesting
brew
a

box
not
something
id
have
often
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
medium
body
above
average
carbonation
slight
warming
overall
this
is
a
nice
meld
of
wine
and
beer
flavors
and
characteristics
i
felt
the
flavor
was
pretty
deep
and
rich
with
the
fruitiness
playing
off
against
the
malts
i
actually
think
the
pork
was
a
weak
pairing
for
this
could
go
with
something
much
more
hearty
maybe
even
venison
i
applaud
the
effort
interesting
mess
allagash
has
made
here
slight
head
and
sticky
lacing
look
good
the
brew
is
the
color
of
tea
and
smells
faintly
of
bread
and
grapes
theres
the
taste
of
malt
and
an
odd
thinness
from
the
grapes
overall
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
o
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
worth
the
wait
a
great
fruity
belgian
thats
actually
a
bit
different
from
allagashs
usual
mo
o
love
allagash
but
ive
experienced
every
once
in
a
while
a
metallic
finish
in
their
bombers
that
being
said
this
one
has
something
to
offer
for
both
the
experienced
enthusiast
and
not
so
much
i
think
its
most
impressive
quality
is
its
lightness
when
regarding
its
abv
definitely
vinous
in
character
flavor
wise
along
with
some
french
belgian
like
flavors
but
finishes
a
little
overly
metallic
or
tinny
or
almost
blood
like
starts
with
sweet
malt
followed
by
funky
belgian
yeasty
undertones
along
the
midpalate
deep
red
wine
flavors
high
acidiy
covered
brisk
carbonation
finishes
again
with
that
very
tinny
finish
there
is
a
fain
bitterness
that
comes
through
that
balances
things
pretty
well
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
into
beers
with
winelike
attributes
certainly
different
from
the
victoria
but
i
would
probably
get
this
beer
again
when
its
available
but
i
wont
be
running
over
people
to
do

taste
is
the

with
some

and
a

flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer

the

is
better

i
like
the

less
than
most

ales
an
obviously
well
made
ale
that
just
did
not
suit
my
palate
o
overall
not
my
favorite

by
far
i
prefer
victoria
better
the

are
intergrated
a

more
this

was
a
yeasty
mess
overall
3

different
but
not
something
that
i
will
go
out

i

to
a
light
lacing
that
never
goes
away
there
is
a
light
aroma
that
is
mostly
grapes
and
some
grains
the
tastes
is
just
a
bit
sweet
but
it
allows
this
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
couple
other
light

flavors
hidden
in
there
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
for
me
each
sip
is
lighter
than
the
other
the
9
is
well
hidden
overall
another
quality
selection
from
allagash
really
enjoyed
this
one
even
though
it
was
a
bit
sweet
but
to
be
expected
drinkability
this
is
a
wonderful
strong
belgianstyle
pale
it
has
strong
base
malt
notes
and
spicy
additions
from

the
cabernet
grapes
add
tangy

are
a

an

worth

for
me
though
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
it
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
the
9
0
percent
so
watch
out
this
beer
reminded
me
a
little
of
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
this
brew
poured
out
with
a
nice
golden
color
to
it
the
head
was
white
and
fluffy
the
smell
of
the
grapes
on
the
nose
came
through
nicely
and
gave
this
beer
a
slight
winelike
aroma
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
on
the
sweet
side
and
leaves
you
with
a
good
aftertaste
also
the
grapes
are
more
sweet
than
tart
i
think
either
way
still
pretty
nice
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
had
a
fairly
light
body
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
nice
probably
one
of
the
better
allagash
brew
ive
had
i
would
drink
this
one
again
oh
it
was
gusher
but
i
hadnt
cooled
it
before
opening
a
rookie
mistake
dont
open
at
70
degrees
or
youll
lose
a
bit
of
beer
o
a
nice
hybridtype
beer
that
definitely
stays
in
the
beer
realm
but
captures
some
nice
winelike
qualities
the
red
grapes
used
impart
a
subtle
sweetness
that
isnt
too
overbearing
and
the
wine
yeast
strain
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
qualities
very
nicely
done
im
grateful
for
already
having
tried
this
beer
in
portland
on
tap
and
bottle
poured
already
i
was
lookin
for
the
perfect
winebeer
hybrid
to
share
with
my
father
and
this
seems
to
have
done
the
trick
although
the
beer
is
pricy
its
absolutely
worth
the
money
if
you
are
searching
for
a
flavorful
belgian
style
ale
sweetly
blended
with
grapes
or
just
a
good
beer
in
general
overall
very
solid
beer
no
wow
factor
per
se
but
pretty
damn
tasty
im
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
overall
this
is
one
nice
beer
worth
trying
once
or
twice
but
not
really
worth
11
dollars
the
palate
is
a
little
syrupy
sweet
but
the
carbonation
cuts
teh
syrupy
mouthfeel
for
a
little
balance
just
a
little
noticeable
warmth
from
the
alcohol
rather
mellow
overall
o
i
dont
really
feel
like
drinking
this
one
again
i
like
grape
juice
just
fine
but
juice
is
juice
beer
should
seem
more
like
beer
the
color
is
slightly
pink
with
a
white
head
smell
is
of
the
grapes
and
other
fruity
tones
with
slight
hint
of
belgian
style
yeasts
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
more
grape
very
light
mouthfeel
overall
solid
beer
but
nowhere
near
the
price
tag
i
paid
for
it
though
there
are
many
beers
not
brewed
with
grapes
that
rival
the
complexity
and
elegance
of
even
the
finest
wines
this
one
however
barely
even
affords
the
simple
quaffability
of
an
average
beer
allagash
has
proven
they
know
what
theyre
doing
with
barrels
so
perhaps
its
my
own
tastes
that
account
for
my
disappointment
with
this
offering
either
way
this
is
not
a
cheap
beer
and
a
750ml
bottle
is
quite
a
commitment
its
not
something
ill
be
buying
again
jd
o
just
really
disappointing
i
like
that
the
grape
flavor
is
there
but
its
just
too
sugary
o
im
not
going
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
allagash
brew
but
it
is
a
solidly
made
flavorful
beer
the
yeast
is
much
more
prevalent
than
i
expected
on
the
flavor
uberbready
and
i
am
surprised
there
is
not
a
big
fruit
ester
surge
grapes
pretty
much
stand
alone
in
that
regard
hops
are
there
aplenty
and
kind
of
muddle
things
up
a
bit
malts
are
toasty
and
crackery
light
toffee
spicy
and
phenolic
light
acidity
and
some
grape
tannins
interesting
to
say
the
least
although
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
againeven
at
half
the
17
price
tag
definitely
an
interesting
taste
experience
the
subtle
blend
of
flavors
are
much
more
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
there
is
craftstmanship
in
the
restraint
shown
here
and
the
beer
never
threatens
to
overwhelm
the
senses
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
ive
had
really
good
luck
sitting
on
allagash
stuff
for
about
1
to
2
years
no
exception
here
extremely
refined
complex
and
balanced
highly
recommended
with
some
age
opinion
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
to
me
it
is
obvious
that
they
did
a
number
of
test
batches
or
blends
to
get
the
balance
right
i
like
how
the
hops
are
such
a
big
player
in
the
aroma
and
the
initial
parts
of
the
taste
then
they
step
aside
and
let
the
rest
of
the
beer
do
its
thing
for
the
finish
the
grapes
seem
to
really
work
with
this
beer
i
think
that
they
have
done
this
really
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
much
like
a
white
wine
with
bubbles
no
elements
of
booze
or
stickiness
to
detract
from
the
tasting
experience
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
sample
again
sometime
thanks
for
the

a
sweet

in
the
taste
candy

yeasty
almost
like
a
sweet
chardonnay
or
a

a
smooth
and

bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
riesling
like
aftertaste
it
is
like
a
beer
version
of
a
nice
white
wine
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
not
too
boozy
given
the
9
abv
this
is
a
beer
to
hold
on
to
and
enjoyed
with
others
given
the
18
price
tag
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
and
makes
this
quite
drinkable
the
price
tag
makes
it
hard
to
drink
often
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
the
grapes
arent
too
prevalent
when
drinking
although
you
can
tell
there
were
grapes
used
in
brewing
it
not
worth
the
18
price
tag
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
great
i
would
love
to
have
this
at
thanksgiving
the
taste
stars
with
a
slight
yeast
flavor
mixed
with
malt
this
quickly
givesway
to
a
tart
wine
and
almmost
cranberry
flavor
the
mouth
is
a
building
of
carbonation
that
finishes
dry
very
nice
pours
a
hazed
gold

color
with
a
tint
of

is

and
short

leaving
a

spots

big

fragrant
wine
grapes
adding
a
nice
white
wine
type
element
they
really
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
the
aroma
this
beer
smells
great
in
the
flavor
the
wine
grapes
are
still
there
along
with
some
peppery
belgian
yeast
certainly
belgian
ale
yeast
lending
its
subtle
fruity
complexities
that
really
shine
through
and
play
off
the
grapes
mild
tartness
that
has
mellowed
out
to
just
a
notion
alcohol
is
quite
tame
and
just
present
in
the
end
delicate
feel
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
nice
and
drinkable
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beverage
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
body
good
balanced
flavors
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
dark
belgian
ever
but
still
very
enjoyable
was
lucky
to
find
this
for
9
for
a
12
oz
serving
at
a
bar
because
even
though
it
was
good
you
really
dont
need
to
have
a
whole
750ml
of
it
d
this
beer
alone
feels
unfinished
i
can
see
why
they
added
the
sour
aspect
with
victor

bottle
poured
into
a
new
belgium
tulip
style
glass
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
slighlty
offwhite
coastered
head
the
nose
is
a
blended
aroma
of
slight
belgian
yeast
and
subtle
grape
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
lively
carbonaton
level
the
taste
is
grape
not
overally
so
but
a
nice
subtle
grape
balance
against
the
belgian
esters
ends
with
a
slight
bitter
tanic
taste
for
9

the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
not

pretty
easy

thanks
to

for
sharing
these
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
produced
a
two
finger
white
head
that
laced
out
quickly
the
body
of
the
brew
was
a
orange
to
copper
in
color
i
got
a
large
whiff
of
dark
fruits
coming
off
this
brew
raisins
and
plums
stuck
out
the
most
flavor
wise
it
came
off
like
a
fizzy
red
wine
but
with
a
dry
finish
from
the
hops
it
had
a
medium
body
to
it
with
good
carbonation
it
drank
really
well
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
pair
with
a
good
steak
as
with
most
allagash
its
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
d
very
drinkable
for
as
big
of
a
beer
as
it
is
d
goes
down
entirely
way
too
easily
nice
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
beer
is
blended
far
too
nicely
you
would
never

get
it
again

750ml
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
d
well
its
up
and
its
down
it
is
9
abv
but
the
burn
on
the
finish
of
the
taste
is
harsh
and
this
brew
feels
like
it
hits
harder
than
only
9
this
bottle
is
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
drink
alone
but
the
sweetness
and
sourness
of
the
grapes
is
really
quite
pleasant
and
as
it
warms
the
crispness
of
the
pilsnerpale
malt
backbone
makes
up
for
the
increased
alcohol
burn
this
sort
of
reminds
me
of
wine
but
like
a
mix
between
a
sweet
red
and
less
sweet
white
dthe
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
more
integrated
than
the
nose
its
slightly
messy
but
the
flavors
are
nice
and
it
is
rather
easily
drinken
not
a
whole
lot
of
yeast
but
huge
malt
presence
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
style
pours
a
slightly
dirty
golden
color
with
an
off
white
head
nose
brings
forth
some
yeast
but
mostly
a
lot
of
grapes
this
carries
over
into
the
taste
where
despite
some
yeast
and
spice
this
is
almost
just
a
fancy
grape
juice
feel
consists
of
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
all
together
this
is
just
a
bit
much
and
almost
tastes
like
a
grape
juice
mixture
clean
crisp
and
very
drinkable
strong
overall
grape
impression
but
no
one
flavor
dominates
ontap
at
hopleaf
a
light
good
with
an
off
white
head
ok
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
but
not
successfully
very
vinous
throughout
grape
seed
champagneesque
yeast
the
taste
is
pinot
grigo
with
spice
very
vinous
again
feels
like
youre
drinking
a
wine
this
is
not
very
good
and
should
be
skipped
d
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
ontap
not
because
it
was
great
but
because
i
saved
myself
from
buying
an
expensive
bottle
it
was
passable
and
i
didnt
any
problems
finishing
my
tulip
hope
victor
francenstein
is
better
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
above
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
also
a
bit
above
average
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
the
grapes
added
some
nice
and
interesting
flavors
to
it
it
felt
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
grape
juice
flavors
but
at
the
same
time
they
did
a
nice
job
at
making
those
flavors
work
so
well
in
a
beer
a
cool
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
drinks
quite
nice
for
a
9er
overall
this
is
a
sweet
but
delicious
ale
from
allagash
i
had
little
idea
of
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
the
blending
of
grapes
and
wineyeast
into
a
beer
seems
to
work
quite
well
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
with
some
bubbles
the
smell
has
the
grapes
that
i
expected
as
well
as
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
an
overall
earthiness
to
it
taking
a
sip
the
taste
is
sweet
with
more
of
the
grapes
i
taste
some
apple
as
well
i
also
note
belgian
yeast
with
some
bitterness
to
victor
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
style
it
had
been
some
time
that
i
had
been
meaning
to
try
it
and
am
glad
that
i
finally
did
not
bad
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
me
cork
almost
freed
itself
and
the
beer
slowly
started
to
overflow
served
at
close
to
correct
temperature
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
textured
cream
colored
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear

aroma
is
hugely
dominated
by
yeast
then
grape
must
some
malt
flavor
is
quite
sweet
up
front
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
back
and
under
it
all
is
a
general
belgian
style
strong
amber
ale
body
is
quite
soft
and
mouth
filling
carbonation
isnt
enough
to
handle
the
sweetness
maybe
a
good
dessert
beer
finish
is
like
flavor
medium
in
length
and
ending
with
a
slight
alcohol
sweetness
d
this
started
off
smelling
very
similar
to
victoria
but
the
taste
was
much
sweeter
rather
than
hoppy
and
sour
it
had
a
nice
body
too
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
dark
belgian
ever
but
still
very
enjoyable
cellaring
could
possibly
improve
it
d
slow
slow
slow
let
this
baby
get
to
about
room
temp
before
you
drink
it
d
quite
tasty
in
small
batches
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
more
than
one
but
delicious
nonetheless
great
balance
of
flavor
and
masking
of
alcohol
d
not
bad
a
little
too
sweet
and
heavy
to
get
a
higher
score
in
drinkability
consider
this
one
more
of
an
after
dinner
sipper
than
a
pregaming
quaffer
at
the
allagash
promo
coppermine
pub
in
north
arlington
nj
poured
a
mildy
cloudy
yellow
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
and
decent
head
retention
very
herbalspicy
dry
peel
and
some
candi
sugar
in
the
nose
nicely
balanced
aroma
however
the
taste
was
a
little
less
so
very
spicy
with
no
hint
of
fruitiness
and
a
dry
grapefruit
peel
finish
i
will
say
though
that
the
alcohol
content
was
extremely
well
hidden
mildly
carbonated
medium
body
given
the
flavor
progression
and
high
alcohol
content
i
was
exactly
rushing
to
session
this
but
a
good
beer
allaround
as
usual
from
these
guys
d
a
quality
product
from
allagash
but
a
pass
at
the
1720
theyre
asking
at
those
prices
to
rebuy
a
beer
needs
to
have
a
5
in
taste
good
beer
just
overpriced
missed
this
one
when
it
was
at
paradiso
so
i
was
jazzed
check
out
my
jazz
hands
to
see
it
at
the
ck
everyone
deserves
a
second
chance
single
tear
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
large
white
bubbles
though
i
wouldnt
name
them
if
you
catch
my
drift
the
nose
comprises
white
grapes
red
grapes
cane
sugar
and
peaches
i
really
do
like
this
smell
yes
i
do
yuppers
anyway
the
taste
holds
notes
of
white
grapes
banana
cloves
a
slight
bitterness
and
an
even
slighter
tartness
is
slighter
a
word
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
partially
bitter
finish
good
times
d
nice
belgian
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
on
tap
this
past
saturday
night
at
the
dive
bar
in
worcester
served
in
a
0
25l
allagash
glass
for
6
dull
orange
color
with
a
hint
of
forest
green
in
the
body
fizzy
white
head
smelled
like
a
glass
of
wine
fresh
and
a
bit
boozy
taste
was
quite
different
and
unique
there
was
a
lot
of
grape
flavor
to
this
beer
the
brewer
really
got
a
lot
of
the
flavor
out
of
the
barrel
and
into
the
beer
i
have
had
a
few
beers
aged
in
wine
barrels
and
this
one
was
one
of
the
best
examples
mouthfeel
fell
somewhere
between
a
dark
ale
and
a
wine
easy
to
drink
but
a
sipper
a
small
glass
was
all
i
needed
for
this
beer
it
was
an
appropriate
amount
a
great
beer
to
try
if
searching
for
something
new
or
a
nice
crossover
beer
for
wine
lovers
d
a
small
sample
is
sufficient
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
dont
feel
compelled
to
try
this
one
again
the
beer
pours
goldenorange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
with
some
grape
notes
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
grapes
along
with
some
nice
citrus
flavors
there
is
some
alcohol
detectable
as
well
as
some
belgian
yeast
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
excellent
as
well
at
9
3
there
was
zero
alcohol
flavor
i
could
drink
these
for
hours
or
until
i
passed
out
this
beer
has
an
odd
late
sweet
flavor
the
sweetness
somehow
avoids
the
front
of
the
palate
there
is
a
slight
lactic
flavor
there
is
also
an
odd
yeast
character
overall
its
smooth
drinkability
if
fine
d
an
interesting
sipper
that
would
be
great
to
wean
a
wine
lover
to
beer
d
like
it
for
the
style
very
drinkable
edit

i
will
note
that
i
really
liked
the
victoria
ale
but
that
was
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
i
believe
so
perhaps
it
is
the
wine
yeast
that
gives
it
the
taste
i
dont
like
finally
three
other
people
tasted
this
at
my
table
and
2
of
them
were
very
mad
to
have
spent
8
on
810oz
the
other
thought
it
was
average
and
worth
trying
md
victor
goes
down
easy
enough
although
the
10
percent
is
a
bit
easy
to
detect
this
goes
down
pretty
smooth
for
a
medium
sized
semi
sweet
beer
the
carb
was
on
point
as
well
not
overly
crisp
im
glad
i
tried
it
on
tap
as
a
whole
bottle
would
have
been
a
chore
perhaps
ill
buy
a
fresh
bottle
and
share
with
friends
softly
carbonated
up
front
with
a
nice
sweet
alcohol
and
grape
flavor
the
vinous
characteristic
from
the
aroma
isnt
present
here
but
there
is
some
earthy
oak
tannis
but
not
too
much
so
slightly
cider
like
with
ints
of
apple
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
toffee
the
abv
is
decently
masked
but
the
sweet
alcohol
presence
is
still
there
no
noticeable
heat
or
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
sightly
dry
herbalmedicinal
aftertaste
this
was
pretty
good
and
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
vintage
to
compare
it
has
held
up
remarkable
well
overall
i
feel
as
though
the
bottle
version
was
a
bit
harsher
than
what
i
remember
the
tap
version
tasting
like
i
found
that
odd
considering
the
bottle
was
from
2007
anyhoo
this
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
from
allagash
though
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
could
never
have
finished
this
bottle
myself
a
little
grape
goes
a
long
way
a
classic
belgian
flavor
of
yeast
high
alcohol
and
pale
malts
i
would
not
describe
this
as
a
dark
ale
there
is
a
tartness
to
the
beer
that
one
could
associate
with
grapes
but
i
would
not
be
able
to
specifically
as
grapelike
perhaps
its
the
tannin
good
body
again
not
really
what
i
expected
but
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
its
interesting
experimental
and
it
all
works
very
well
together
d
well
this
is
fairly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
i
am
starting
to
join
the
camp
that
thinks
this
category
should
also
factor
in
the
price
tag
which
in
this
case
is
simply
too
high
allagash
is
becoming
brutally
expensive
a
very
wine
like
beer
and
probably
a
good
one
to
share
with
a
wine
aficionado
the
alcohol
is
perceived
well
so
the
drinkability
is
lowered
a
bit
but
its
similar
to
most
wines
taste
is
sweet
but
also
some
sour
with
a
hint
of
wine
nice
and
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
definitely
a
boozey
beer
the
flavors
are
extremely
complex
and
playful
and
the
alcohol
packs
a
punch
with
that
said
it
was
very
easy
to
put
back
each
sip
yielded
new
characteristics
d
this
is
very
winelike
and
should
be
savored
great
for
sipping
darker
copper
color
poured
without
much
head
pleasant
interesting
smell
medium
malts
and
lots
of
fruit
apple
green
grape
melon
flavorwise
this
beer
had
a
nice
malt
base
but
was
way
too
fruity
for
my
tastes
white
wine
flavors
really
dominated
the
beer
inside
and
out
sweet
very
tart
and
lots
of
carbonation
drinkable
not
so
much
more
of
a
slow
sipper
definitely
better
than
the
victoria
which
to
me
is
almost
like
drinking
a
chardonnaybeer
mix
but
not
what
i
would
look
for
in
this
style
this
obviously
needs
to
be
compared
with
victoria
both
are
different
and
interesting
in
their
own
way
victoria
is
more
subtle
and
fruity
the
flavors
here
are
more
assertive
dry
and
sour
i
highly
recommend
both
beers
drinkability
if
i
hadnt
recently
enjoyed
the
sister
brew
victoria
i
would
have
liked
this
better
victoria
vastly
outshines
it
as
a
much
more
refined
product
definitely
a
complex
ale
and
not
the
first
that
ive
had
that
was
brewed
with
grapes
it
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
except
for
the
raisin
notes
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
solid
ale
a
bit
pricey
but
if
you
want
to
treat
yourself
its
worth
a
try
to
me
this
beer
is
a
little
more
like
a
weak
sparkling
wine
than
a
beer
it
does
a
great
job
of
straddling
the
line
between
the
two
not
sure
if
its
worth
20btl
but
its
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
certainly
recommended
with
mexican
food
that
doesnt
carry
too
much
spice
sampled
out
of
a
bottle
at
the
beverage
warehouse
in
winooski
the
color
was
a
dark
orangegold
the
head
offwhite
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
belgian
yeast
alcohol
a
touch
of
chardonnay
grapes
and
some
fruit
esters
the
flavors
were
similar
but
i
wasnt
thrilled
bready
malt
dark
fruit
a
light
spiciness
from
the
yeast
and
the
punch
of
booze
dry
acidic
and
tannic
reminiscent
of
a
brut
champagne
interesting
but
it
lacked
finesse
the
mouthfeel
was
a
good
the
carbonation
high
and
the
body
medium
it
was
ok
but
it
was
expensive
to
purchase
and
for
the
same
dollar
id
rather
have
something
or
a
couple
somethings
else
im
a
huge
fan
of
allagash
brews
but
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
below
their
other
special
offerings
definitely
a
unique
brew
worth
trying
but
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
like
a
musette
or
odyssey
d
fairly
drinkable
although
im
not
sure
i
would
go
back
for
a
second
bomber
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
in
this
line
curieuxmusette
very
creamy
and
remarkably
well
hidden
alcohol
yet
it
left
something
to
be
desired
not
that
it
was
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
ive
been
spoiled
by
their
other
exceptional
offerings
i
guess
pours
a
cloudy
copper
almost
dark
orange
thick
off
white
head
forms
drops
tons
of
lace
very
rocky
head
settles
to
a
medium
layer
looks
good
smell
is
neat
light
sourness
and
acidity
grapes
and
wine
wood
raspberries
and
assorted
fruitiness
oranges
more
fruit
than
the
victoria
a
little
more
intense
with
the
aroma
taste
is
light
sour
and
tannic
strawberries
oranges
bread
melons
very
dry
in
the
middle
some
nice
bready
malt
and
oak
bit
of
funky
sourness
in
the
finish
very
fruity
pretty
neat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
very
dry
nice
funky
finish
i
liked
this
beer
defines
nothing
spectacular
for
me
served
on
tap
at
the
great
lost
bear
pours
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
spotted
lacing
prevailed
the
smell
was
of
red
grapes
a
sort
of
welchs
grape
juice
aroma
but
not
as
sugary
sweet
the
taste
was
similar
i
didnt
enjoy
it
too
much
there
wasnt
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
the
middle
mouthfeel
was
the
worst
part
about
it
too
much
grape
sweetness
overall
just
an
average
ale
nothing
too
impressive
here
the
victoria
ale
is
much
better
just
a
bit
of
haze
to
this
orangeamber
beer
the
light
beige
cap
showed
good
head
retention
and
produced
some
chunky
sticky
lacing
vinous
aroma
lots
of
wine
and
red
grape
skin
juicy
and
fruity
bready
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
mild
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
notes
appeared
as
it
warmed
malty
flavour
up
front
quite
fruity
grape
and
raisin
similar
to
the
aroma
but
a
little
less
vinous
nicely
balanced
with
flavours
really
melding
a
bit
of
toffee
sweetness
held
things
together
smooth
malty
texture
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
a
bit
dry
good
stuff
quite
tasty
with
well
hidden
alcohol
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
great
malty
depth
i
really
enjoyed
the
grape
character
too
good
stuff
good
but
i
had
higher
expectations
overall
not
the
most
exciting
beer
to
drink
but
i
finished
half
a
bottle
just
fine
the
aroma
is
unimpressive
with
malt
cheese
yeast
and
grapes
the
appearance
is
deep
gold
amber
with
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
i
like
it
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
a
really
mediocre
beer
from
a
good
brewer
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
im
not
sure
the
style
listed
is
correct
but
this
is
another
epic
win
for
allagash
different
tasty
and
highly
recommended
definitely
check
this
out
would
gladly
drink
another
good
nicely
balanced
beer
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
fninish
fruity
throughout
and
dominating
on
the
mid
palate
a
hint
of
raisin
pinot
noir
grapes
black
cherry
berry
fruit
spicey
etheral
qualities
light
bodied
but
long
on
the
finish
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
not
get
tired
of
it
very
easy
sitting
on
the
palate
the
grapes
show
through
nicely
id
say
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
definitely
interesting
but
just
too
expensive
for
the
quality
it
was
awfully
bitter
and
overshadowed
by
a
high
abv
i
love
allagashs
experimental
tendencies
and
their
constantly
pushing
the
limit
but
the
last
several
brews
ive
had
by
them
just
havent
delivered
the
quality
i
expect
for
the
price
ive
paid
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
clear
toasted
grain
color
with
an
average
soapy
white
head
that
didnt
leave
much
as
it
settled
the
aroma
is
of
white
grapes
a
bit
cidery
the
grape
aroma
pretty
much
dominates
everything
else
the
taste
is
again
of
white
grapes
honey
a
hint
of
pepper
and
grain
ending
with
some
bittering
hops
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fairly
soft
carbonation
the
finish
starts
off
slick
but
ends
up
dry
a
very
nice
bspa
that
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
with
sweetness
or
spice
but
delivers
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
nice
drying
finish
rounds
off
the
brew
that
make
drinking
the
750ml
bottle
enjoyable
booze
isnt
detectable
and
the
crisp
carbonation
adds
a
refreshing
aspect
to
a
beer
already
eerily
similar
to
a
provencal
rose
an
excellent
if
not
unexpected
choice
for
a
summer
brew
d
the
carbonation
not
the
alcohol
seems
to
want
to
catch
up
with
me
after
a
bit
still
a
very
drinkable
and
classy
beer
as
noted
below
excellent
marriage
of
grain
and
grape
expensive
though
impressive
what
a
delicious
beer
this
is
not
a
belgian
strong
dark
but
it
is
tasty
if
a
little
odd
i
dont
like
this
as
much
as
any
of
the
russian
river
wine
barrel
aged
beers
or
dfh
red
and
white
but
it
has
some
similar
characteristics
pours
a
beautiful
golden
with
a
very
nice
finely
bubbled
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
coriander
with
a
touch
of
clove
tart
grapes
that
are
somewhat
subtle
but
contribute
a
pronounced
sweettartness
and
a
touch
of
pepper
the
taste
is
similar
quite
tart
with
a
lot
of
coriander
and
a
bit
of
pepper
perhaps
a
few
too
many
grapes
for
me
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
but
again
the
tartness
is
foremost
interesting
but
not
spectacular
bottle
courtesy
of
jay23
poured
a
deep
hazy
copperorangey
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
light
grape
taste
taste
is
a
quite
complex
mix
between
some
light
grapes
sweet
belgian
malt
with
some
yeasts
attenuation
and
a
light
funky
finish
very
light
notes
of
oak
and
tart
notes
are
also
noticeable
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
good
but
not
sure
i
would
purchase
very
often
considering
the
price
tag
pours
a
rich
dark
gold
with
a
yeasty
froth
cap
fruity
tart
nose
supported
by
the
first
lippuckering
taste
grape
flavors
and
rich
smooth
maltiness
soon
take
the
lead
well
balanced
by
refreshing
hop
bitterness
very
much
unlike
most
beers
of
this
styleto
my
taste
like
a
cross
between
a
triple
and
a
bière
de
garde
unlike
the
former
theres
more
thick
malt
and
candy
sugar
flavors
and
unlike
the
latter
more
crisp
tartness
excellent
offering
though
as
always
from
the
folks
at
allagash
d
very
enjoyable
beer
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
drink
frequently
but
when
i
do
i
look
forward
to
it
pours
a
reddish
amber
hue
with
a
bright
white
delicate
head
and
excellent
clarity
nice
lacing
quite
fruity
aroma
that
conveys
a
juicy
feeling
along
with
the
phenols
that
are
typical
to
the
style
it
also
has
an
element
that
is
caramelsweet
and
somehow
winey
at
the
same
time
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
gewurztraminer
without
the
spice
on
the
palate
tangy
and
sweet
from
start
to
finish
with
bright
full
fruitiness
oranges
from
the
midpalate
onward
active
slightly
solvent
finish
of
raw
alcohol
overall
this
is
very
well
done
this
is
seemingly
a
very
sweet
beer
although
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
its
just
the
fruitiness
of
it
fooling
my
brain
i
would
be
very
curious
to
try
a
version
of
this
beer
without
grapes
added
as
it
is
it
just
tastes
like
a
well
executed
fruity
belgian
ale
without
any
overtly
winey
or
grapey
characteristics
well
done
the
taste
is
more
tartsour
than
i
expected
but
in
a
pleasant
way
even
though
it
makes
me
pucker
after
drinking
quite
a
carbonation
kick
usually
too
much
is
bad
but
it
works
very
well
with
this
not
a
bad
use
of
grapes
at
all
present
but
in
a
supportive
role
fairly
complex
a
very
slow
one
with
some
astringency
and
alcohol
making
it
a
bit
tough
to
get
through
interesting
d
i
came
away
from
this
impressed
and
apathetic
at
the
same
time
on
one
hand
this
beer
does
a
great
job
blending
the
grape
qualities
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
so
that
neither
overpowers
the
other
and
the
funk
in
this
beer
was
the
best
ive
noted
in
a
nonbelgian
beer
on
the
negative
side
i
felt
this
beer
while
complex
lacked
the
focus
that
makes
the
great
belgian
beers
great
something
to
try
but
doubt
i
will
grab
another
pours
a
warm
orange
amber
color
with
shallow
wispy
off
white
head
that
struggles
and
settles
to
the
surface
nicely
visibly
effervescent
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
this
st
feuillien
goblet
generating
intense
surface
pools
of
foam
that
leave
textbook
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
aggressive
there
is
an
undeniable
presence
of
the
alcohol
at
first
over
a
tart
yet
sweet
fruity
fragrance
and
an
almost
balanced
earthy
malt
and
yeasty
aroma
this
bottle
indicates
9
abv
vs
the
10
40
indicated
on
this
page
well
carbonated
without
being
fizzy
the
signature
tiny
bubbles
of
this
belgian
strong
ale
give
the
mouth
feel
a
really
wonderful
creamy
texture
the
first
sample
is
notably
warming
the
alcohol
is
neither
timid
nor
distracting
full
flavored
the
creamy
tartness
of
the
mouth
and
classic
fruity
taste
from
this
belgian
yeast
finishes
with
a
pleasant
almost
dry
sensation
this
one
is
a
keeper
while
the
dark
piece
of
this
is
understated
the
complexity
is
well
worth
considering
highly
recommended
somehow
i
finished
the
bottle
with
some
minor
help
from
a
friend
not
one
i
would
revisit
anytime
soon
allagash
bottles
alot
of
their
experiments
and
this
is
one
i
cant
recommend
starts
like
a
duvel
finishes
like
a
sherry
an
interesting
complex
taste
but
definitely
an
aggressive
beer
the
hot
alcohol
detracts
from
the
drinkability
but
otherwise
an
interesting
beer
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
pretty
redorange
color
with
a
small
head
a
very
still
beer
looked
like
a
cantillon
offering
a
sweet
fruity
mostly
pear
a
little
grape
aroma
fairly
tart
taste
some
yeast
impression
of
grape
juice
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
up
to
the
usual
allagash
standard
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
flower
smell
and
some
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
had
a
unique
blended
flavor
so
it
was
a
bit
hard
to
describe
but
very
tasty
drinkability
interesting
experiment
but
ultimately
a
failure
in
my
book
not
very
drinkable
as
the
balance
is
out
of
whack
and
the
flavor
profile
is
just
not
that
enjoyable
drinkability
overall
a
good
all
around
beer
better
than
average
for
sure
but
i
think
my
days
are
over
of
paying
these
exorbitant
prices
for
allagash
special
releases
i
still
have
the
interlude
and
the
musette
to
have
very
soon
both
cost
more
than
15
a
pop
the
jury
remains

then

with
grapes
and
raisin
flavors
playing
a
prominent
role
spice
roasty
malts
and
alcohol
warming
all
play
big
roles
too
fairly
full
bodied
with
less
carbonation
than
expected
but
enough
to
make
this
beer
surprisingly
refreshing
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
with
some
good
wine
qualities
too
drinkability
allgash
is
one
of
those
breweries
wellknown
for
always
cooking
up
interesting
twists
and
turns
to
implement
into
their
brewing
some
of
these
ideas
pay
off
in
beer
drinking
gold
and
others
well
they
just
remain
as
cute
concepts
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
latter
overall
a
quality
brew
from
allagash
as
always
and
definately
overpriced
it
was
an
interesting
idea
and
fun
to
taste
with
friends
but
could
in
no
possible
way
become
a
regular
or
be
affordable
in
a
commercial
setting
ok
this
is
another
specialty
from
allagash
the
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
the
taste
was
smooth
with
a
hint
of
fruit
i
would
even
say
a
sweet
taste
now
here
it
the
problem
i
have
this
beer
unlike
most
allagash
beers
ive
had
this
one
didnt
stand
out
from
any
other
fruity
beers
i
can
probably
name
4
5
or
even
6
beers
that
have
the
same
tastes
now
this
is
not
to
say
this
is
not
a
good
beer
it
is
very
much
so
this
somehow
seems
to
fizz
in
the
end
the
grape
flavors
just
dont
add
up
to
a
complexity
of
flavor
what
really
seems
to
be
the
problems
is
that
the
grape
berry
notes
are
too
dominant
the
underlying
beer
flavors
dont
play
enough
of
a
role
for
a
beer
this
clean
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
is
fairly
clean
it
really
could
use
quite
a
bit
more
funk
to
it
a
touch
of
brett
might
make
this
beer
sublime
another
interesting
offering
from
allagash
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
would
choose
other
examples
of
the
style
before
victor
glug
glug
glug
another
very
nice
beer
from
allagash
on
par
with
all
of
their
other
special
releases
once
again
i
think
this
is
great
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
so
subtle
lots
of
flavor
in
there
and
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
but
all
without
being
in
you
face
fairly
mild
all
around
yet
still
very
interesting
very
well
made
and
balanced
this
one
is
worth
picking
up
and
seeking
out
d
this
drinks
incredibly
smooth
the
best
compliment
i
can
say
is
it
drinks
like
this
has
been
a
style
for
years
not
a
one
off
yes
ill
have
another
nice
round
chewy
mouthfeel
very
peppery
coupled
with
ripe
pear
flavor
that
persists
throughout
a
bit
buttery
midsip
and
into
the
finish
where
the
grape
character
really
comes
forth
another
interesting
beer
from
allagash
they
really
seem
to
be
pushing
the
envelope
of
what
beer
is
of
late
20
is
a
bit
steep
imo
but
im
glad
theyre
out
there
trying
something
new
pours
a
dark
murky
orangish
amber
with
a
big
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
lace
in
big
clumps
all
over
aroma
is
signature
allagash
yeasty
spicy
bready
and
also
has
some
candied
sugar
cant
really
smell
the
grapes
but
they
come
through
just
a
little
when
quaffed
i
was
worried
this
was
going
to
be
an
overly
fruity
beer
but
the
grapes
add
a
very
nice
finish
that
is
dry
sweet
and
earthy
not
overly
sweet
and
earthy
in
a
different
sort
of
way
than
usual
very
subtle
theres
actually
a
lot
going
on
here
and
a
very
complex
thing
is
happening
an
experiment
that
reminds
me
how
fun
this
whole
thing
is

spices
remind

of

really
really
pleasant

the

aroma
is
light

some
apples

but
a
stronger
element
of

the
followon
scent
is
a
mildly

is

an

round
this
one
out
nicely
o
would
have
liked
less
banana
from
the

and
more
citrus

the
dry
finish
was
interesting
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
good
clarity
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
an
earthy

this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
hard
to
do
a
review
on
because
it
was
gone
so
quick
the
intensely
fine
brettanomyces
driven
carbonation
gives
the
body
an
airy
moussey
fee
very
refreshing
and
very

l
barnyard
funk
in

overall
delicious
and
packed
with
dry

o
very
good
bretted
notes
brings
a
slight
gentle
sourness
that
perfectly
complements
the
brew
carbo
is
spot
on
too
lending
to
that
creamy
initial
hit
a
very
interesting
belgian
ale
similar
to
matilda
from
goose
island
cant
really
recommend
over
the
latter
due
to
the
price
premium
but
its
got
a
killer
aroma
and
great
flavor
o
really
interesting
beer
has
hints
of
farmhouse
but
also
hints
of
standard
belgian
ale
the
farmhouse
characters
are
the
dominant
with
the
brett
aromas
and
flavors
clear
and
forward
interesting
if
you
like
farmhouse
this
is
for
you
overall
felt
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
but
i
found
the
flavors
to
be
ephemeral
nothing
lasted
long
and
it
seemed
to
change
theres
nothing
definitive
in
the
flavor
theres
a
lot
of
different
components
that
almost
seem
to
conflict
but
the
flavors
change
very
interesting
and
thoughtprovoking
brew
brassy
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
thin
lacing
left
behind
has
an
obvious
brett
nose
with
a
little
spice
mixed
in
tastes
of
orange
peel
white
grape
a
bit
of
grain
and
hint
of
salt
at
the
end
medium
in
body
with
wellhidden
alcohol
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
all
the
way
through
this
beer
is
between
gold
and
straw
in
color
with
a
haze
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
the
aroma
is
a
tropical
fruit
and
peppery
spice
there
is
a
passion
fruit
flavor
with
a
subtle
brett
flavor
of
old
socks
but
old
socks
that
taste
good
i
have
definitely
had
several
beers
where
the
brett
is
a
little
overpowering
but
this
beer
had
a
nice
blend
of
fruity
notes
from
the
yeast
and
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
works
well
with
the
brett
i
really
enjoyed
it
because
all
the
flavors
work
really
well
together
the
beer
pours
a
very
strong
and
foamy
clean
white
head
the
head
lasts
a
while
and
the
lacing
on
the
glass
form
a
perfect
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
yellowish
copper
the
beer
smell
is
fairly
complex
with
a
hint
of
tartiness
the
smell
has
bits
of
a
bread
smell
from
the
malts
the
tarty
brett
smell
is
there
as
well
and
is
slightly
obscured
by
the
white
wine
smell
as
well
as
the
hops
the
hops
are
fairly
close
to
a
slightly
grassy
smell
and
orangey
smell
the
white
grapes
smell
makes
it
difficult
to
properly
distinguish
the
beer
taste
is
different
from
the
smell
the
beer
taste
is
primarily
hops
mixed
with
the
brett
the
malts
make
an
appearance
as
a
backbone
for
the
taste
and
balances
out
the
hops
and
brett
in
addition
to
the
hops
the
beer
also
has
a
white
wine
taste
to
it
with
hints
of
citrus
orange
the
feels
is
fairly
clean
and
goes
down
similar
to
water
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
might
get
again
o
overall
balanced
beer
could
hit
a
alittle
more
on
flavor
great
silly
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
however
the
taste
with
its
bold
yeast
strains
is
just
a
little
too
funky
for
me
it
does
start
to
mellow
as
it
warms
but
its
still
a
little
wild
for
my
liking
which
is
a
bit
of
a
shame
since
i
really
like
allagash
a
lot
i
may
try
this
again
since
it
did
seem
to
almost
grow
on
me
as
time
went
on
still
an
excellent
brewery
that
i
want
to
continue
exploring
new
beers
with
forget
champagne
for
those
special
celebrations
reach
for
confluence
ale
instead
its
added
earthen
complexity
makes
for
a
greater
culinary
experience
without
sacrificing
the
bubbles
body
or
bounce
o
overall
a
good
well
balanced
beer
from
allagash
very
relaxing
brew
subtle
with
good
flavors
and
a
dry
unique
finish
750
ml

bottled
june
2013
overall
this
might
be
in
my
top
five
desertisland
beers
in
fact
id
like
to
curl
up
with
a
sixtel
of
this
on
an
abandoned

somewhere
for
a
week
or
three
tell
drunken
stories
and
whatnot
ointeresting
beer
farmhouse
ale
with
some
hints
of
wild
ale
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
could
have
a
touch
less
funk
and
a
bit
more
complexity
tldr
the
smell
is
fantastic
the
taste
is
confused
the
mouthfeel
is
super
super
super
dry
overall
the
beer
needs
to
age
to
be
worth
your

brett
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
nice
hop
character
def
best
fresh
or
with
a
couple
years
on
it
let
the
dry
hops
die
out
a
little
and
the
brett
take
over
more
and
increase
complexity

if
you
will
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
very
much
like
a
belgian
ale
with
a
clean
white
threefinger
head
smells
like
a
dubbel
almost
has
that
fruity
belgian
smell
to
it
taste
is
like
a
mixture
of
25
sour
and
75
dubbel
theres
a
tiny
tiny
hint
of
sour
but
the
beer
is
very
light
has
a
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
down
very
reminiscent
of
a
dubbel
with
the
fruit
taste
very
enjoyable
beer
will
definitely
have
again
o
this
was
plucked
just
in
time
as
there
were
slight
traces
of
skunking
but
it
held
up
in
the
bottle
magnificently
such
a
unique
and
complex
brew
that
words
almost
dont
do
it
justice
0
it
wasnt
a
bad
expierence
and
golden
ales
arent
normally
my
thing
but
this
one
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
its
not
bad
but
not
great
idk
if
i
would
recommend
it
this
was
the
june
2012
bottle
would
like
to
try
an
older
version
o
awesome
overall
the
only
reason
i
pulled
the
trigger
on
this
one
is
that
total
wine
knocked
the
price
down
to
12
for
a
bomber
which
is
fair
imonot
sure
if
its
worth
having
at
19
99
either
way
its
a
well
crafted
beer
and
i
would
like
to
try
other
offerings
from
allagash
o
exceptionally
clean
and
crisp
the
craftsmenship
is
in
the
smooth
and
well
toned
flavor
pretty
good
wild
ale
but
not
complex
enough
really
to
warrant
the
high
price
tag
on
the
bottles
luckily
the
price
per
ounce
on
a
growler
fill
was
half
that
of
the
bottles
so
a
worthwhile
purchase
to
try
something
new
o
pretty
average
beer
overall
drinkability
is
high
but
at
the
price
of
20
per
750ml

skip

and
a

intro
into

overall
good
solid
wild
ale
m
very
carbed
between
light
and
medium
o
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
guess
being
a
wild
from
allagash
and
being
highly
recommended
from
the
bar
tender
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
to
me
the
beer
felt
like
a
slightly
lemony
triple
that
they
tried
to
sour
a
little
bit
there
wasnt
much
tartness
and
the
tartness
that
was
there
i
felt
just
didnt
fit
in
the
beer
very
well
i
probably
wouldnt
order
this
again
but
i
could
maybe
see
how
some
people
might
like
it
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
another
solid
wild
from
allagash
not
a
sour
beer
at
all
but
some
light
funk
and
a
ton
of
oranges
and
brett
very
easy
to
drink
and
something
i
would
certainly
recommend
if
you
like
brett
i
will
certainly
be
having
it
again
respectable
sour
somewhat
complex
but
it
needs
something
to
give
the
malt
some
character
its
fleeting
as
it
is
a
fruity
tone
or
malt
flavor
would
make
this
more
than
a
stage
for
something
else
i
had
high
hope
for
this
beer
and
with
the
smell
i
was
expecting
something
more
fruity
in
taste
the
taste
was
overwhelmed
by
must
i
do
suppose
its
a
wild
ale
and
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
very
nice
finish
though
maybe
worth
checking
out
but
not
blowing
my
mind
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
vase
the
beer
is
a
light
pale
lemonyellow
coloring
with
a
sparse
coating
of
white
film
aromas
of
white
grape
and
cherry
semisweet
and
a
bit
sour
flavors
are
subtle
and
lightly
sour
with
the
grape
flavors
holding
the
palate
similar
to
a
pinot
gris
but
fuller
bodied
and
carbonated
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
slightly
filmy
clean
crisp
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
oddidi
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
i
was
definitely
surprised
i
enjoyed
it
but
did
not
love
it
it
was
worth
a
try
but
i
was
left
a
bit
disappointed
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
an

of
the

foamy
splotches

on
the

down
smell
is
of
grain
spices
and
some
light
sourtart
lemonlike
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
but
there
is
also
a
yeast
flavor
that
i
am
getting
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
a
very
mild
sour
all
around
o
a
great
brew
nice
and
funky
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
very
well
balanced
and
very
nicley
done
this
would
be
awesome
on
a

evening

o
very
approachable
and
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
beer
for
someone
that
had
no
prior
experience
with
brett
very
sessionable
and
a
regular
beer
for
me
i
think
i
have
consumed
like
four
750
ml
bottles
in
the
last
six
months
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
the
sourness
is
a
nice
complement
but
does
not
overpower
the
other
aromas
or
flavors
refreshing
and
could
easily
replace
champagne
as
a
celebratory
beverage
regardless
of
the
occasion
confluence
works
well
as
a
before
dinner
drink
and
i
can
imagine
relaxing
with
it
on
a
hot

pretty
bittersure
there
are
some
hops
in
there
as
well
nearly
bonedry
finish
with
lots
of
lingering
complexities
funkolicious
overall
the
first
problem
is
that
this
is
built
using
the
saison
style
as
a
base
which
is
not
my
favorite
beer
even
so
oro
de
calabaza
and
fantôme
saison
are
much
more
enjoyable
this
is
just
a
mediocre
attempt
at
a
wild
maybe
more
time
would
improve
it
or
maybe
it
is
better
in
the
bottle
but
i
was
not
impressed
if
the
goal
is
to
create
a
mild
wild
they
have
succeeded
confluence
has
a
bright
gold
going

of
loose

brett
some

over

taste
comes
off
with
alot
of
refined
brett
with
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
some
bitterness
on
the
end
not
all
that
sour
i
could
not
say
this
is
even
tart
more
like
a
saison
with
brett
in
taste
and
feel
confluence
has
a
mediumish
feel
with
active
bubbles
off
the
tap
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it
taste
wise
but
it
aint
all
that
wild
i
wouldcould
drink
a
bunch
of
this
but
at
25
a
bottle
ill
pass
glad
its
off
the
spout
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
golden
yellow
a
fluff
of
white
head
was
visible
at
the
tap
but
my
glass
was
filled
to
the
brim
so
there
was
really
no
room
for
a
head
of
any
kind
light
aroma
grassy

with
tones
of
light

the
taste

the

with
a

apple
skinnot
too
thick
or
overbearing
grassy
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
hints
of
spicy
yeast
light
mouthfeel
pretty
dry
in
the
finish
and
quite
drinkable
overall
but
not
overly
flavorful
and
i
do
like
my
wild
ale
to
be
loaded
with
flavor
but
this
is
still
a
nice
selection
and
lesser
on
the
sour
side
for
those
who
dont
like
sour
beers
o
its
an
alright
wild
ale
bit
more
of
an
in
your
face
taste
and
cooling
down
the
carbonation
a
tad
and
this
would
be
a
superb
beer
the
beer
is
different
and
perhaps
i
dont
have
a
true
appreciation
for
bret
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
easy
drinking
and
approachable
sour
highly
recommended
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
but
it
does
have
session
quality
there
arent
any
flavors
or
taste
notes
that
really
stand
out
this
pours
a
very
cloudy
hazy
dull
orangish
yellow
with
a
billowing
two
finger
whispy
head
it
is
softly
sour
on
the
nose
you
get
some
funk
brett
lemon
notes
tangerine
and
spicy
belgian
yeasts
it
has
a
really
really
nice
and
approachable
nose
the
flavors
too
could
be
described
as
soft
you
get
a
lighter
bodied
belgian
spice
all
around
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
brett
is
there
but
its
not
overbearing
its
a
lot
lighter
in
body
than
i
imagined
it
somewhat
hurts
the
flavor
profile
since
it
abbreviates
the
flavor
with
a
quick
finish
it
just
takes
away
from
the
beer
as
a
whole
really
that
is
why
overall
id
say
its
just
ok
if
you
were
just
getting
into
wilds
id
say
its
a
nice
place
to
start
but
this
wont
thrill
anyone
who
really
enjoys
the
style
definitely
well
made
beer
a
great
sourish
fruitiness
with
a
dry
malt
flavor
and
an
edge
of
bitterness
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
good
start
in
exploring
beers
beyond
the
usual
styles
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
nose
but
still
good
this
is
a
nice
wild
ale
but
it
definitely
didnt
blow
me
away
i
guess
its
balance
is
a
detriment
definitely
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
a
very
good
beer
o
a
great
belgianstyle
ale
the
sourness
is
mellow
and
adds
complexity
without
detracting
from
drinkability
d
pretty
great
wild
beer
id
think
even
non
sour
beer
fans
would
enjoy
this
the
smell
was
amazing
that
said
the
flavor
is
a
bit
light
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
though
havent
really
had
anything
else
like
it
cheers
overall
a
great
american
wild
ale
and
the
dry
hopping
is
a
real
nice
touch
that
makes
this
one
better
than
average
not
sure
about
the
price
though
nearly
25
a
bottle
seems
a
bit
steep
were
starting
to
go
beyond
the
cost
of
a
bottle
of
cantillon

many
more
the

leave
a
disappointing

with
the

as
to
experience

again
overall
the
hopped

melds

with
an
almost
invisible

this
is
an
otherwise
perfect
beer
sampled
at
julios
belgian
beer
festival
on
august
14
2011
they
were
pouring
the
2011
batch
the
color
is
oliveyellow
with
a
fizzy
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
very
memorable
and
distinctive
as
it
marries
together
the
allagash
belgian
house
yeast
and
some
wild
yeast
which
emits
a
flowery
piney
earthy
combination
the
body
is
light
but
delicate
lots
of
zesty
acidic
fruits
in
the
taste
such
as
lemon
apple
and
pear
very
interesting
and
worth
trying
d
this
was
a
nice
wild
ale
with
great
scent
but
relatively
bland
taste
the
body
was
nice
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
the
taste
matched
the
scent
but
instead
it
ended
up
being
somewhat
boring
and
forgettable
i
doube
age
would
improve
but
it
maybe
bring
out
more
brett
character
not
worth
the
price
fresh
notes
of
tart
grape
skins
cherries
and
loads
of
funk
some
light
spiciness
and
a
decent
touch
of
oak
lots
of
dark
fruit
tart
funkiness
and
a
nice
earthy
woodsy
like
smell
blending
together
very
nicely
on
this
one
silk
like
smoothness
and
the
finest
carbonation
bubbles
really
well
done
in
that
regard
ots
of
sour
in
here
right
up
front
with
frapes
and
light
lemon
like
citrus
taking
over
rolling
through
some
nice
notes
of
cherry
then
came
over
me
decent
funkiness
in
through
the
middle
and
the
finish
but
it
was
actually
almost
blended
out
by
a
cherry
like
sweetness
and
more
hints
at
a
sugary
touch
o
i
would
drink
this
over
and
over
really
an
amazing
beer
gets
better
with
age
and
the
brett
on
this
really
lends
great
flavors
a
o
this
is
wonderful
it
shares
many
similarities
with
orval
o
decent
brew
the
brett
adds
some
complexity
but
the
base
brew
could
be
better
i
like
this
bottle
more
than
i
remember
its
very
complex
and
drinkable
its
an
excellent
belgian
style
golden

or
whatever
you
call
it
i
figure
it
would

well
with

a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
the
head
was
solid
looking
and
had
plenty
of
retention
the
lacing
was
a
little
sticky
but
doesnt
really
coat
the
glass
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
generous
amount
of
funk
on
the
nose
not
the
most
appealing
of
smell
in
my
opinion
the
taste
a
little
bit
of
a
tart
flavor
to
it
but
its
actually
not
too
bad
the
other
flavors
are
a
little
floral
with
just
a
touch
of
yeast
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
would
probably
drink
this
one
again
notes
maybe
not
the
utterly
complex
and
extraordinary
brew
that
some
expected
me
to
believe
but
this
is
quite
a
rich
brett
driven
brew
complex
enough
and
top
quality
just
a
bit
short
of
that
hyped
complexity
maybe
i
expected
something
slightly
different
of
a
wild
ale
this
felt
like
a
nicely
hopped
saison
with
brett
in
fact
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
boulevardss
saison
brett
which
i
find
better
rounded
i
would
recommend
this
one
although
under
this
pricing
allagash
labels
this
as
a
dry
hopped
golden
ale
and
it
feels
better
suited
under
that
framing
750ml
bottle
from
rayl101pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
active
carbonation
aroma
is
funky
ripe
peach
citrus
peel
this
is
absolutely
heavenly
taste
is
sweet
with
some
sour
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
finish
is
dry
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
search
it
out
again
perfect
in
almost
every
way
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
chillin
at
the
pad
i
hope
it
develops
better
than
what
i
had
on
tap
i
guess
ill
have
to
search
for
the
flavors
that
are
supposed
to
be
there
because
i
didnt
find
them
the
first
time
around
yeah
im
a
fan
of
that
it
drinks
like
a
conventional
beer
but
theres
a
whole
lot
of
weird
idiosyncracies
going
on
as
well
love
it
pours
a
hazed
golden
straw
color
minimal
spotty
head
little
lacing
scent
is
muted
barnyard
funk
from
the
brett
a
light
fruityness
bready
lightly
spiced
tasted
was
much
more
mild
then
expected
muddy
earth
damp
wood
barnyward
lightly
metallic
the
fruityness
is
replaced
by
a
more
savory
taste
backbone
is
quite
belgian
with
bready
malts
and
yeast
light
spicing
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
aggressive
carbonation
doesnt
help
mild
palate
a
very
muted
flavor
profile
allows
the
belgian
base
to
shine
through
not
a
favorite
sigh
it
doesnt
really
know
what
it
wants
to
be
its
not
a
good
belgian
style
ale
and
its
not
a
good
american
wild
it
just
sits
in
the
void
between
the
two
again
im
not
particularly
impressed
i
expect
more
from
allagash
and
from
american
wilds
in
general
another
on
tap
at
memphis
taproompart
of
the
no
repeat
beer
week
poured
into
a
tulip
a
very
hazy
lighter
golden
color
with
a
wimzy
white
heading
that
didnt
stick
around
to
long
the
brett
is
not
to
powerful
here
in
the
nose
or
on
the
palate
light
crisp
malty
notes
with
lighter
fruits
dominate
mostly
just
a
dash
of
brett
to
give
it
that
barnyard
appeal
very
refreshing
d
a
decent
wild
ale
though
very
straightforward
the
brett
has
really
taken
this
over
and
made
it
its
own
not
worth
the
price
point
when
compared
to
interlude
i
far
prefer
interlude
narrative
walter
chiu
always
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
he
wasnt
born
in
south
side
jamaica
queens
it
was
nothing
that
he
could
overtly
point
to
but
a
substantiated
hunch
was
enough
sure
everyone
told
him
he
was
queens
native
what
with
his
transposed
ls
and
rs
his
affinity
for
texas
instrument
products
and
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
mmo
lore
yet
somehow
he
looked
askance
at
their
appraisals
wait
wait
wait
mom
tell
me
again
as
a
child
i
used
to
play
the
5
string
bass
incessantly
i
dont
even
know
how
to
play
the
bass
oh
yes
sweetie
we
couldnt
stop
playing
that
sly
and
the
family
stone
record
you
were
so
fond
of
those
were
the
days
he
watched
his
mother
carefully
slice
the
uni
into
diaphanous
strips
but
still
rubbed
his
weak
chin
at
the
prospect
that
he
was
an
avid
fan
of
thelonius
monk
o
overall
happy
to
have
tried
it
it
definitely
was
refreshing
but
not
really
my
style
of
wild
ale
also
just
wasnt
tart
or
funky
enough
for
my
taste
overall
this
was
quite
different
i
really
enjoyed
the
lemon
notes
good
balance
and
very
crisp
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
drinks
really
well
tasty
sour
profile
although
more
tart
than
completely
puckering
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
the
beer
was
delicious
though
the
brett
showed
great
pineapple
tropical
fruit
flavors
and
a
little
funk
but
limited
amounts
of
phenols
which
can
sometimes
be
offputting
the
hopping
was
perfect
to
provide
some
grounding
and
balance
to
the
beer
the
carbonation
was
a
little
low
but
pleasant
with
the
fruity
bretted
beer
tasty
but
better
presentation
might
help
this
beer
score
better
overall
a
very
good
choice
to
pair
with
the
speck
smoked
german
bacon
and
rye
toast
i
was
eating
will
have
to
hunt
down
more
of
this
and
age
it
again
this
time
for
longer
definitely
recommended
as
a
special
occasion
brew
o
this
stuff
was
solid
and
quite
refreshing
i
was
lucky
to
get
a
12oz
pour
for
just
3
and
at
that
price
point
its
fantastic
however
its
not
something
id
drop
17
on
a
750
its
great
and
refreshing
but
it
isnt
that
good
for
a
reasonable
price
this
stuff
is
great
and
worth
it
it
starts
off
with
a
fruity
sweetness
and
borderlinesyrupy
body
thats
kept
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
by
spoton
carbonation
the
bubbles
spew
some
of
those
bretty
notes
at
you
which
you
get
up
front
along
with
some
grape
and
apple
tastes
the
wildness
doesnt
come
until
the
end
but
brings
a
perfect
drying
taste
with
which
it
finishes
very
balanced
and
not
too
abrasive
skål
overall
the
hops
in
a
sour
beer
add
an
interesting
dimension
though
i
prefer
my
wild
ales
to
be
a
little
more
straightforward
toasted
and
well
carbonated
melba
toast
and
cut
grass
are
upfront
malted
barely
with
bread
toast
and
spring
fruits
and
a
splash
of
tartness
i
would
not
think
this
is
an
american
wild
ale
by
taste
alone
still
a
good
beer
worth
trying
and
sharing
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
pretty
tanic
and
acidic
there
is
nearly
no
carbonation
and
that
doesnt
help
a
very
well
made
tasty
brew
dry
fruit
flavors
spicy
yeast
flavors
with
a
dash
of
funk
i
am
surprised
i
waited
this
long
to
open
this
bad
boy
light
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
forming
disk
this
looks
good
nose
has
mostly
brett
with
light
sourness
rather
orvallike

bandaid
lots
of
clove
and
light

palate
is
similar
biscuit
honey
bandaid
and
clove
no
hops
light
floral
honeylike
sweetness
drying
and
bretty
on
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
very
very
high
a
little
watery
but
great
otherwise
solid
stuff
d
really
not
my
style
of
wild
ale
with
too
much
brett
that
masked
most
of
the
other
flavors
but
was
drinking
good
though
pours
clear
golden
yellow
with
tons
of
carbonation
thick
fluffy
white
foam
that
persists
great
lacing
fruity
green
apple
aroma
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
funk
the
flavor
is
very
funky
with
lots
of
barnyard
notes
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
light
airy
flavor
somewhat
sour
but
a
nice
malty
sweetness
balances
it
out
a
bit
silky
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
if
its
between
this
and
interlude
get
interlude
d
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
i
received
this
as
part
of
a
bif
but
i
understand
the
price
tag
is
high
highly
drinkable
refreshing
creation
love
the
citrus
tart
bite
in
this
beer
similar
to
fantomes
tartness
but
with
a
different
flavor
profile
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
so
complex
there
really
is
no
way
of
take
it
all
in
this
late
in
the
night
it
has
its
own
way
of
light
the
night
and
it
works
so
well

this

served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
hazy
deep
yellow
with
a
four
finger
massively
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
actually
bulged
up
larger
and
larger
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
but
very
very
slowly
subsided
to
one
finger
with
lots
of
sitting
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
funk
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
there
were
some
very
interesting
notes
going
on
in
this
one
i
really
had
mixed
feelings
on
it
in
my
opinion
there
was
just
too
much
funk
in
this
one
and
not
enough
sourtart
going
on
good
but
just
not
all
that
aweinspiring
interlude
is
still
my
favorite
offering
in
this
category
from
allagash
light
to
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
somewhat
sweet
tart
and
finishes

such
a
superb

i
have
to

d
solid

very

with
keeping
in
tact
the
basic
malt
and
hop
base
and
building
on
it
with
the
sourness
and
brett
funk
very
complex
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
above
average
drinkability
is
good
it
had
a
lot
of
great
flavors
to
it
and
a
nice
complexity
as
well
all
the
flavors
melded
very
well
and
it
seemed
very
balanced
for
a
wild
ale
a
very
nice
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
really
something
its
strongly
carbonated
and
is
really
lively
on
the
tongue
then
it
dries
up
quickly
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
some
more
complex
and
assertive
flavors
d
delicious
and
refreshing
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
and
earthy

flavors

with
the
addition
of

in

malty
subtle

with
a
very

taste

some

flavors
as
well
not
bad
but
if
you
arent
a
big
brett
fan
they
this
may
not
be
the
beer
for
you
d
having
had
ng
rd
golden
ale
recently
and
at
nearly
12
the
cost
per
ml
i
much
prefer
that
the
high
carbonation
and
phenolester
character
with
plasticy
notes
i
do
not
appreciate
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
maybe
too
balanced
its
easy
to
drink
no
doubt
and
far
from
boring
it
just
lacks
a
k
o
punch
confluence
pours
just
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
gold
and
quite
clear
its
got
an
impressive
foamy
white
head
on
it
especially
seeing
the
condition
ive
seen
most
of
the
beers
served
in
tonight
lacing
is
also
above
average
all
that
pageantry
just
led
to
a
letdown
when
i
first
leaned
in
for
a
smell
it
had
the
aroma
of
a
watered
down
allagash
blonde
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
brett
wheres
my
funk
the
taste
brings
more
balance
between
the
malty
sweetness
with
a
little
more
earthiness
along
with
the
fruitiness
of
blonde
and
the
brettanomyces
i
can
find
just
a
hint
of
the
black
pepper
ive
been
getting
from
their
house
yeast
strain
all
night
as
well
the
pieces
are
in
place
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
stand
out
overall
and
it
could
stand
to
be
pushed
even
a
little
bit
further
towards
the
funk
best
carbonation
on
any
of
the
allagash
brews
ive
had
tonight
though
very
nice
and
lively
even
for
a
wild
confluence
seems
just
a
tad
watery
but
im
really
just
splitting
hairs
at
this
point
the
restrained
brett
influence
albeit
too
restrained
imo
and
the
solid
execution
on
confluence
support
a
nicely
flavored
beer
and
make
it
solidly
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
brew
of
the
night
d
easy
to
drink
i
could
probably
enjoy
an
entire
bomber
for
myself
and
not
think
twice
this
beer
is
great
make
sure
you
try
this
one
yourself
without
a
doubt
id
do
it
again
on
a
side
note
this
is
my
first
review
posted
from
my
new
android
phone
not
convenient
at
this
point
going
back
to
laptoppcbased
ticking
d
i
know
damn
well
this
is
a
good
beer
but
what
happened
with
this
pour
bad
batch
a
mispour
something
happened
here
that
just
wasnt
good
such
a
shame
too
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
very
nice
tightly
beaded
head
and
some
excellent
lacing
i
love
the
aroma
very
fruity
with
mango
apricot
melon
and
a
touch
of
lime
this
fruit
is
underpinned
by
a
gentle
funk
that
has
a
characteristic
of
overripe
fruit
rather
than
horseblanket
or
barnyard
this
would
probably
change
substantially
with
some
age
the
taste
has
more
apricot
up
front
than
in
the
nose
and
here
there
is
also
a
bit
of
ripe
cheese
funkiness
but
just
a
touch
there
is
a
drying
note
of
lime
and
some
sharp
but
earthy
hops
as
well
as
some
dry
malt
and
a
crisp
yeast
profile
some
deep
flavors
here
with
a
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
its
dry
and
crisp
but
very
earthy
and
with
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
at
the
end
very
interesting
beer
and
quite
nice
right
off
the
truck
without
any
extra
aging
not
always
true
for
an
american
sour
d
delicious
with
a
lower
abv
relatively
and
very
refreshing
and
crisp
mouthfeel
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
750ml
bottles
on
a
warm
day
sitting
on
a
nice
shaded
porch

grabbed
this
one
in
celebration
of
my
buying
my
first
home
a
great
brew
although
not
quite
as
outstanding
as
most
of
allagashs
big
brews
this
one
was
kind
of
your
straightforward
sour
and
tart
flavors
that
you
get
in
a
wild
funky
brew
with
some
fairly
consistent
yeast
and
milder
hop
flavors
with
some
occasional
fruity
orangecitrus
again
not
bad
but
in
no
way
as
impressive
as
a
lot
of
allagashs
or
even
their
comparable
interlude
drinkabilitythis
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
brett
flavors
intact
but
still
mild
enough
that
delicate
floral
flavors
are
still
there
man
really
good
beer
these
folks
know
what
theyre
doing
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
rocky
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
slightly
pale
amber
aroma
is
full
and
of
yeast
barnyard
spice
hops
malt
fresh
cut
grass
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
and
has
a
slightly
sweet
background
upon
which
are
the
tart
and
bitter
flavors
are
evidenced
body
is
excellent
in
the
way
that
is
best
for
this
style
not
too
thick
yet
not
thin
with
champagnelike
carbonation
the
finish
is
like
flavor
and
where
i
notice
the
characteristics
of
the
brett
which
nicely
complements
the
beer
finish
is
fairly
long
satisfying
good
drinking
beer
id
defy
someone
blindfolded
to
say
this
isnt
belgian
kudos
to
allagash
brewmasters
a
hearty
well
done
confluence
ale
is
an
easy
drinking
wild
ale
though
it
isnt
quite
seated
in
the
uppertier
enjoyable
but
for
the
price
id
be
more
inclined
to
check
out
allagashs
other
beers
before
i
drink
this
one
again
served
in
a
flight
with
oro
de
calabaza
and
ommegang
ommegeddon
with
grilled
white
shrimp
with
tomatillopeach
salsa
d
wonderfully
smooth
and
quaffable
effortless
d
one
fine
summer
sipper
incredibly
refreshing
though
i
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
as
after
the
nose
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
d
not
my
favorite
wild
ale
but
certainly
a
different
take
on
the
style
read
not
sour
a
good
fruitiness
which
i
really
enjoyed
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
certainly
wild
and
funky
a
good
member
of
the
miscellaneous
pale
belgian
categorybut
slightly
wilder
reminds
me
of
a
saison
another
wonderful
allagash
brew
d
really
interesting
beer
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
all
the
interesting
flavors
going
on
overall
pretty
good
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
very
similar
to
la
roja
or
some
other
jp
brews
i
thought
with
oak
predominantly
taking
over
wow
i
had
a
glass
of
this
as
a
part
of
tasting
new
beers
at
my
local
beer
bar
this
one
stood
out
from
everything
i
tasted
and
they
were
all
belgians
it
had
a
unique
aroma
very
refreshing
while
still
being
interesting
flavor
again
great
sourness
without
being
difficult
to
drink
i
can
have
numerous
glasses
of
this
beer
3
5
d
not
bad
but
sort
of
run
of
the
mill
the
price
however
makes
this
a
beer
to
avoid
dpretty
tasty
brew
here
nice
balance
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
back
and
a
nice
brett
presence
with
delicious
peach
in
there
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
little
heavier
than
most
that
ive
had
in
the
style
but
theres
enough
complexity
and
flavor
to
make
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
another
great
beer
from
allagash
gotta
love
how
theyre
always
willing
to
go
out
there
and
push
the
envelope
with
their
beers
the
body
was
nice
and
mouth
coating
without
being
sticky
drinkability
was
very
nice
smooth
and
easy
overall
very
nice
beer
but
one
that
probably
wasnt
worth
the
22
price
tag
drinkability
very
drinkable
with
an
interesting
refreshing
nature
the
beer
itself
is
not
so
sour
there
is
an
odd
citrus
bitterness
to
it
and
some
zest
only
slightly
citric
based
sourness
and
almost
no
lactic
notes
finishes
cleanly
not
my
favorite
sour
but
its
ok
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
very
easy
drinking
if
you
like
the
tartness
earthy
haylike
finish
bottle

and

of
dry
brett
notes
with
a
lightly
sweet

profile
and
some
dry
european
style
hops
taste
is
quite
refreshing
with
some
clear
brett
notes
that
are
well
balance
with
the
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
dry
hops
also
provide
some
further
enjoyment

well
done
and
refreshing
for
the
style
i
havent
had
too
many
wilds
in
my
career
so
i
jumped
a
bit
when
i
saw
this
guy
on
tap
at
churchkey
the
pour
goes
just
as
i
suspected
resulting
in
a
somewhat
hazy
champagne
gold
the
head
consists
of
a
ring
o
large
bubbles
that
dont
last
the
length
of
the
drink
the
nose
is
wild
and
fruity
with
notes
of
white
grapes
brett
funk
and
grapefruits
the
taste
is
not
all
that
different
spotlighting
orange
peels
bananas
cloves
a
dry
slap
of
bitter
hops
and
the
skin
of
some
mandarin
oranges
i
have
no
other
way
to
describe
that
last
one
took
me
almost
ten
minutes
just
to
come
up
with
that
unfortunately
for
me
the
more
bitter
aspects
were
what
shined
through
drowning
out
the
more
fruity
sour
wild
notes
overall
it
tasted
like
biting
into
an
orange
peel
and
all
just
before
the
fruit
is
ripe
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
less
than
i
expected
for
some
strange
reason
and
a
rather
dry
finish
i
gotta
say
i
was
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
not
disgusted
or
anything
like
that
but
definitely
disappointed
taste
cheers
city

store
allagash
night
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
while
it
wasnt
quite
up
to
them
it
was
also
quite
different
than
what
i
expected
altogether
its
a
mildly
sour
beer
with
an
excellent
pale
grain
flavor
oddly
clean
for
the
style
otherwise
theres
a
floral
quality
and
a
big
earthiness
from
the
belgian
yeast
almost
lightly
smoky
in
a
dry
mushroomy
kind
of
way
mild
though
definitely
detectable
hops
provide
bits
of
herbaceous
minerals
and
grass
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
quite
dry
and
the
feel
is
mild
though
good
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
for
a
sour
im
aging
a
bottle
to
see
if
the
sour
notes
come
out
more
with
time
d
nice
all
around
not
the
best
awa
that
ive
had
but
nice
and
a
little
bit
different
d
goes
down
very
easily
tastes
fantastic
nice
kick
i
would
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
one
f
very
dry
and
gets
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
some
spicy
hops
that
seem
to
really
shine
through
on
the
finish
more
lingering
dry
earthy
barnyard
funk
spicy
with
a
little
warming
booze
hmmm
i
wonder
this
tastes
a
little
young
even
though
this
beer
is
preaged
before
bottled
and
release
it
could
use
some
time
for
sure
it
has
the
familiar
belgian
yeast
flavors
a
lot
of
allagashs
beers
use
theres
a
watery
blandness
though
that
i
just
cant
shake
even
though
theres
quite
a
bit
going
on
the
brett
needs
some
time
to
mature
and
tarten
up
to
compliment
the
sweet
notes
a
mild
hop
backbone
pokes
through
resembles
a
pilsner
with
a
small
amount
of
brett
with
a
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
there
is
no
issues
with
drinkability
on
this
beer
thats
for
sure
overall
it
needs
a
little
age
a
little
dissapointed
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
a
long
shot
a
very
solid
beer
for
the
allagash
lineup
d
what
i
fault
this
brew
for
in
the
mouthfeel
department
aids
in
its
drinkability
since
confluence
is
not
a
palate
crusher
a
few
glasses
in
a
sitting
would
not
be
out
of
the
question
this
quite
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
decent
american
wild
but
with
the
other
stuff
that
russian
river
and
lost
abbey
are
cranking
out
id
probably
pass
on
this
one
however
i
did
get
a
taste
of
allagashs
coolship
with
cherries
at
notb
and
that
was
very
well
done
so
i
know
they
can
make
good
wilds
extremely
wellcrafted
and
good
overall
very
drinkable
paid
over
20
for
this
sucker
and
im
glad
it
didnt
end
up
being
too
much
of
a
ripoff
price
points
for
allagash
do
tend
to
run
high
to
ridiculous
though
and
i
end
up
passing
on
many
of
their
beers
for
that
reason

allagash
is
a
wonderful
brewery
producing
some
very
tasty
beers
taste
very
sour
and
funky
really
sharp
and
tart
its
got
some
real
spicy
funk
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
easy
to
dink
for
beig
so
funky
drinkability
very
drinkable
drinkability
quite
a
drinkable
brew
considering
the
heavy
carbonation

a
tasty
brew
superbly
drinkable
i
like
it
a
lot
i
am
quite
impressed
with
allagashs
offerings
that
ive
had
they
show
restraint
and
a
deft
hand
which
aids
a
high
level
of
enjoyment
and
drinkability
something
you
dont
always
see
in
sours
very
heady
upon
the
pour
had
to
let
it
sit
even
with
a
gentle
pour
a
clovey
horse
blankety
smell
i
had
the
interlude
a
month
before
and
expected
the
nice
sour
belgian
ale
flavor
i
got
a
funky
clovey
sour
and
sweet
flavor
some
decent
hop
bitterness
as
well
the
first
few
sips
were
a
little
too
funky
but
as
the
bottle
went
on
it
was
a
great
flavor
my
fiance
liked
it
too
and
shes
not
a
big
sourfunk
person
i
figure
it
was
a
good
balance
a
fair
abv
for
the
taste
involved
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
real
nice
funky
complexity
thanks
eric
overall
a
solid
example
of
an
american
wild
if
this
was
cheaper
i
would
consider
drinking
this
more
often
but
for
the
price
and
the
lengths
i
went
to
get
it
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
it
anytime
soon
a
great
beer
just
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
thanks
kevin
for
this
great
beer
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
two
fingers
of
billowing
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
good
too
the
aroma
was
complex
and
a
little
queer
leafygrassy
notes
sweet
fruits
apples
and
pears
as
well
as
the
must
of
wild
yeast
the
flavors
were
similar
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
brettanomyces
the
alcohol
punch
was
also
quite
distinct
but
the
fruit
and
must
helped
to
conceal
it
earthiness
and
a
good
malt
backbone
helped
to
balance
it
all
some
lemonlike
citrus
notes
appeared
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
finish
was
dry
and
clean
but
a
little
awkward
the
body
was
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
but
the
carbonation
remained
pretty
high
throughout
the
whole
sampling
as
you
might
imagine
its
an
easy
drinker
for
saison
aficionados
unfortunately
i
am
drinking
this
straight
up
it
would
excel
with
many
food
pairings
id
imagine
mushroom
risotto
smoked
salmon
mussels
clams
its
an
overall
pleasure
to
drink
and
to
review
yes
it
is
a
little
pricey
but
saison
lovers
should
pull
the
trigger
on
this
at
least
once
d
pretty
good
overall
i
enjoyed
this
at
the
allagash
brewery
and
then
again
on
a
summer
afternoon
outside
with
a
couple
good
stinky
cheeses
something
about
the
earthiness
of
this
beer
lends
itself
to
being
enjoyed
outdoors
the
beer
smells
really
funky
and
sour
strongly
similar
to
the
nose
of
orval
tart
brett
throughout
the
taste
isnt
quite
bracingly
sour
but
lives
just
about
on
that
edge
barnyard
flavors
horseblanket
mustiness
etc
that
hit
the
spot
for
me
also
a
light
citrus
in
the
bitter
aftertaste
maybe
not
too
far
from
lemons
very
good
and
easy
to
quaff
i
love
what
allagash
does
with
wild
ales
i
just
wish
it
were
cheaper
along
the
lines
of
jolly
pumpkin
then
again
lost
abbey
charges
twice
as
much
so
this
may
be
a
relatively
pricey
luxury
for
the
foreseeable
future
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
allagash
offering
this
beer
was
well
done
i
am
very
impressed
and
it
is
very
drinkable
this
would
be
something
i
would
definitely
pick
more
up
of
d
pretty
solid
but
theres
room
for
improvement
the
brett
is
a
bit
too
dominant
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
otherwise
quite
nice
poured
an
explosive
cloudy
copper
with
a
head
that
takes
a
while
to
settle
earthy
aroma
replete
with
brett
and
fruit
white
apples
pear
and
citrus
zest
mixed
with
belgian
yeast
funky
both
in
the
nose
and
taste
yet
the
funk
is
the
pleasant
variety
that
enhances
the
sweetness
of
the
underlying
brew
more
apples
and
now
a
vinuous
quality
pop
up
pleasant
trippellike
spice
and
body
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
sour
beer
as
it
is
more
earthy
and
fruity
than
anything
else
nice
d
great
beer
thanks
joepais
this
reminded
me
of
their
collaboration
with
de
proef
a
joy
to
drink
even
my
wife
liked
this
one
i
have
had
up
to
two
pours
of
this
brew
and
i
say
that
was
my
limit
do
to
the
punch
it
packs
i
have
grown
to
like
this
beer
and
will
drink
it
again
md
light
crisp
and
a
very
well
carbonated
very
lively
in
the
mouth
very
easy
drinking
as
well
d
meh
one
of
the
more
boring
members
of
the
american
wild
family
that
comes
with
a
high
price
tag
i
probably
wont
be
checking
out
the
other
bottle
of
this
i
have
for
a
very
long
time
once
again
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
saison
drinkability
decent
i
expected
a
better
beer
than
this
though
with
more
sour
and
funk
this
one
has
too
much
influence
from
their
trippel
although
many
of
their
beers
suffer
that
fate
cant
say
i
blame
them
though
stick
to
what
works
i
hope
they
keep
working
on
this
as
i
know
they
can
do
better
drinkability
no
interference
from
the
alcohol
at
all
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
yet
another
well
made
beer
from
the
gang
at
allagash
this
beer
smells
horrible
in
a
way
that
some
of
the
worlds
best
cheeses
smell
horrible
in
the
same
way
that
i
wouldnt
condemn
a
cheese
for
smelling
bad
i
am
not
going
to
damage
my
rating
of
this
beer
for
having
an
unpleasant
nose
confluence
is
a
work
of
art
in
a
liquid
format
beautiful
mix
of
sweet
sour
and
spice
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
and
i
wish
i
could
get
some
kegs
to
tap
at
my
place
id
even
be
happy
with
some
bottles
just
amazing
d
this
was
very
different
than
most
wild
ales
you
come
across
it
reminded
me
of
a
mix
of
orval
and
interlude
in
some
ways
this
beer
is
still
heavily
belgianinfluenced
with
a
hint
of
america
d
very
good
my
taster
disappeared
way
too
fast
semi
cloudy
yellowy
amber
with
a
sparkling
near
white
head
that
trails
fine
and
scattered
lacing
fruity
nose
with
lemon
and
pinapple
on
the
old
sniffer
very
dry
brew
with
more
citric
fruits
and
a
moderatly
sour
mid
section
and
finish
certaintly
tasty
subtle
complex
and
interesting
tasty
brew
if
it
was
not
so
expensive
in
bottles
id
like
to
age
a
few
and
enjoy
a
few
others
another
ba
worthy
effort
and
a
quality
achievement
in
brewing
from
allagashs
brewers
ive
met
a
handful
of
people
who
are
a
little
baffled
by
this
beer
but
i
encourage
you
to
not
be
afraid
it
is
like
a
painting
which
seems
ludicrous
at
first
but
in
which
you
find
numerous
meanings
and
nuances
with
additional
viewings
fantastically
original
brew
pours
a
deep
yellowlight
amber
in
color
huge
pop
on
the
cork
bursting
with
carbonation
the
gentlest
pour
gave
the
biggest
head
smells
musty
and
a
dryhopped
aroma
ive
not
smelt
a
wild
ale
that
smelled
so
hopped
very
dry
and
the
hops
stood
out
at
first
but
over
time
the
other
flavors
came
to
the
forefront
dry
ephervescence
prevails
some
citrus
apricot
light
fruit
fairly
sticky
on
the
tongue
but
even
for
a
wild
not
the
easiest
drink
a
very
slow
sipper
decent
but
for
the
cost
there
are
better
available
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
smooth
and
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
the
complexity
left
me
looking
how
to
characterize
the
flavors
the
beer
was
perfect
for
a
summer
evening
it
is
incredibly
multifaceted
tons
going
on
and
a
great
drinking
experience
this
drinks
very
easily
a
nice
funkyish
brew
head
is
a
thick
white
that
does
not
dissipate
there
is
grapefruit
and
spice
with
something
soapyfunky
with
an
underlying
fruit
that
i
cant
really
identify
it
is
drinkable
but
not
in
large
quantities
i
think
the
flavor
im
getting
is
banana
and
cloves
this
is
an
interesting
brew
this
beer
remains
stubbornly
effervescent
until
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
works
quite
well
with
this
quaffablebeyonditsalcohol
beer
i
like
the
balance
in
the
flavor
between
the
spicy
fermentation
notes
the
fruit
the
pale
malt
and
the
fresh
hop
character
that
this
brew
has
at
times
the
zesty
hop
character
really
comes
through
quite
well
this
must
have
been
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
when
freshly
released
it
is
eminently
quaffable
with
just
enough
brettanomyces
influence
to
keep
my
interest
piqued
throughout
definitely
a
wonderful
effort
and
i
like
that
the
allagash
house
brett
strain
has
run
roughshod
over
the
rest
of
the
beer
though
that
can
be
nice
at
times
too
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
to
age
definitely
unique
but
not
one
ill
run
out
for
for
18
keep
up
the
good
work
though
allagash
overall
an
average
to
aboveaverage
awa
cheers
upon
tasting
the
sweetness
is
largely
relegated
to
the
finish
plenty
of
acidic
wildness
the
yeast
character
comes
across
perhaps
as
spicy
white
pepper
a
good
amount
of
funk
certainly
but
its
a
little
different
of
an
experience
that
my
most
recent
wild
brews
the
flavor
profile
is
perhaps
not
as
dynamic
as
the
aroma
suggested
it
might
be
sweetness
seems
to
have
taken
a
far
more
distant
role
than
it
did
in
the
bouquet
dryish
actually
which
turns
out
to
be
ok
though
it
lacks
backbone
to
a
minimal
degree
overall
this
tasted
more
like
a
saison
than
a
wild
ale
to
me
even
compared
to
most
saisons
this
falls
short
on
many
levels
not
really
impressed
with
this
offering
from
allagash
d
this
one
doesnt
taste
like
7
the
heat
and
funk
make
me
instinctively
reach
for
another
sip
dnice
a
mildly
tart
fruit
bowl
not
overly
complex
and
seems
to
be
lacking
something
glad
i
was
able
to
get
this
on
tap
and
not
pay
20
for
a
bottle
its
nice
but
not
that
nice
this
beer
all
over
and
rather
than
complexity
it
comes
through
as
muddled
confusion
granted
this
was
a
birthday
present
but
i
saw
it
for
22
at
some
stores
confluence
is
ok
but
its
not
22
ok
drinkability
is
hit
by
the
weird
herbal
nature
of
this
one
that
just
kind
of
gets
out
of
hand
for
me
ok
allagash
we
all
know
you
just
snuck
in
some
of
de
proefs
yeast
here
perhaps
from
your
collaboration
with
them
admit
it
ontap
at
raleigh
times
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
frothy
layer
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
decent
lacing
aroma
is
loads
of
sour
citrus
and
decent
spice
the
taste
is
a
decent
amount
od
sour
citrus
and
slight
malt
with
decent
spicing
the
beer
is
fairly
light
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
wild
ale
taste
mouthfeel
herbal
hoppiness
and
astringent
husky
grain
bit
of
green
apple
phenolic
yeasty
mildly
funky
but
more
rubbery
than
anything
the
crisp
dry
texture
is
nice
but
thats
unfortunately
the
only
nice
aspect
of
this
beer
more
mediocre
overpriced
beer
from
allagash
woohoo
d
this
is
complex
drink
that
seems
evolve
with
each
sip
i
could
easily
see
killing
a
bomber
of
this
by
myself
smelled
wonderful
slighty
sour
kinda
like
a
cider
nicely
carbonated
paired
up
really
well
with
the
seafood
i
had
not
overpowering
in
flavor
with
an
good
balance
of
sour
and
hops
this
was
my
first
wild
ale
and
i
really
liked
and
will
drink
it
again
hv
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
unfortunately
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
high
hopes
i
had
for
it
i
love
most
allagash
brews
and
i
love
everything
wild
and
sour
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
but
this
one
falls
a
little
flat
on
both
fronts
i
wouldnt
normally
mention
the
pricevalue
of
a
beer
but
these
big
allagash
brews
can
run
a
pretty
penny
and
i
almost
definitely
would
not
pay
the
20
for
this
again
that
said
its
still
an
above
average
and
enjoyable
beer
being
a
recent
bottling
it
is
still
young
at
this
point
and
id
like
to
see
how
the
brett
plays
out
with
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
if
this
could
crank
the
sour
just
a
bit
i
think
itd
be
much
better
as
it
is
right
now
i
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
than
a
wild
ale
overall
not
that
wild
but
certainly
pretty
good
interesting
enough
but
i
found
it
accessible
tasty
and
refreshing
more
than
anything
else
i
would
recommend
this
highly
but
im
not
quite
sure
that
its
worth
the
price
point
i
hate
to
be
like
that
but
was
a
very
bright
golden
color
with
a
pretty
good
head
with
an
off
white
color
the
aroma
was
not
very
strong
but
was
plesant
and
carried
a
light
crisp
fruit
smell
with
it
the
taste
was
of
a
well
balanced
and
crafted
brew
the
fruit
comes
threw
very
lightly
and
is
carried
with
the
flavors
of
the
hops
there
were
not
any
overpowering
flavors
in
this
brew
for
me
everything
was
balanced
and
came
threw
very
tasty
the
brew
felt
very
light
and
did
not
weigh
me
down
which
is
great
for
a
7
4
beer
the
carbonation
was
very
low
but
was
just
enough
this
can
easily
beer
a
brew
to
have
in
session
certainly
better
than
average
but
not
very
memorable
which
was
a
disappointment
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
is
a
mostly
clear
golden
orange
beer
with
a
white
head
of
minuscule
bubbles
about
2
cm
in
height
there
is
a
malty
spiced
aroma
that
is
also
very
floral
the
taste
is
of
sweet
citrus
at
first
it
reminds
me
of
grapefruit
as
you
begin
experience
the
flavors
the
floral
tones
come
out
strong
and
evolve
into
pure
hops
by
the
end
only
becoming
apparent
just
as
you
swallow
the
tastes
of
this
beer
are
very
complex
and
quite
amazing
there
is
a
light
to
medium
body
overall
im
quite
impressed
with
this
wild
ale
its
not
as
great
as
allagashs
gargamel
but
it
is
still
very
impressive
much
easier
to
obtain
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
drink
it
again
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
beer
to
think
about
as
you
drink
it
hazy
gold
appearance
with
medium
size
very
dense
head
that
falls
quickly
aroma
is
predominately
belgian
funk
and
gambrinus
honey
malt
flavor
is
pilsen
honey
and
belgian
aromatic
malt
with
just
enough
hop
to
balance
yeast
flavor
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
straight
belgian
and
brett
finishes
fairly
long
with
brett
flavors
beer
seems
young
ill
give
this
one
2
years
in
the
cellar
and
it
should
be
perfect
then
drinkability
reasonably
complex
and
more
than
interesting
enough
to
hold
my
attention
throughout
the
full
eleven
ounces
served
to
me
each
sip
presents
something
a
little
bit
different
and
duly
requires
a
second
sip
a
third
sip
etc
recommended
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
sour
ales
and
arent
turned
off
by
the
price
tag
complex
you
will
want
to
seek
this
one
out
and
try
poured
from
a
bottle
courtesy
of
my
brother
thanks
adam
appearance
is
pretty
standard
golden
straw
small
head
fading
into
a
fine
laced
glass
of
beer
smell
is
impressive
for
a
wild
ale
some
wild
yeast
minimal
hops
and
most
importantly
a
strong
berry
scent
if
all
sour
beers
could
smell
like
this
taste
is
perfect
for
a
young
sour
lots
of
soft
blueberry
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
bit
of
sourness
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
sour
with
an
excellent
flavor
very
drinkable
compared
to
most
wild
beers
i
have
had
mouth
feel
is
pretty
typical
for
the
appearance
with
a
slight
linger
of
flavor
but
otherwise
clean
and
dare
i
say
refreshing
on
a
warm
washington
day
i
would
definitley
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
of
this
if
you
see
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
one
that
put
me
very
much
in
mind
with
the
collaborative
effort
allagash
did
with
and
de
proef
well
done
mouthfeel
okay
but
just
not
a
good
beer
its
various
component
flavors
and
aroma
just
did
not
find
any
sort
of
harmonic
confluence
i
like
allagash
stuff
but
its
barrelaged
gear
while
good
has
not
brought
me
all
the
way
over
the
top
until
now
it
may
have
a
much
lighter
body
than
curieux
interlude
or
the
other
suspects
but
i
am
amazed
by
the
cleanliness
of
this
thing
and
how
well
it
drinks
for
something
jacked
up
on
brett
its
hopped
differently
i
e
more
it
seems
and
takes
advantage
of
a
lot
of
synergies
just
enough
balsawood
consistency
of
the
malt
to
keep
a
good
spritely
backbone
while
letting
the
yeast
brett
and
the
light
yet
prevalent
carbonation
mix
it
up
with
a
little
hop
in
its
step
light
snack
but
good
to
say
the
least
yeah
its
in
the
highrent
district
but
yknow
location
location
location
overall
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
american
wilds
its
got
a
good
amount
of
funk
but
is
by
no
means
overpowering
its
almost
a
combination
of
a
trippel
and
awa
definitely
worth
a
try
i
could
only
drink
so
much
of
this
i
have
no
others
of
the
style
to
compare
it
to
but
i
will
easily
finish
this
750
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
the
cost
may
be
prohibitive
but
i
will
try
again
drinkability
id
sit
back
sip
and
enjoy
this
new
stellar
addition
to
the
rob
tod
collection
rob
thanks
for
another
great
beer
not
something
that
is
terribly
drinkable
i
love
allagash
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
cork
popped
like
rocket
but
didnt
gush
was
immediately
overcome
by
an
intoxicating
light
fruity
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sourness
makes
me
think
of
a
red
yellow
and
green
sourpatch
kid
combined
taste
is
as
smooth
and
delicate
as
the
aroma
suggests
sourness
is
nuanced
not
dominant
mouthfeel
is
light
and
almost
fizzy
though
the
head
dissipated
quickly
this
is
insanely
drinkable
another
quality
brew
from
allagash
i
suppose
im
biased
because
i
really
like
allagas
products
but
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
it
had
that
yeasty
farmlike
aroma
but
also
was
sweet
and
peppery
i
thought
it
had
a
tropical
fruit
taste
a
bit
of
spicy
zing
mostly
a
sweet
mouthfeel
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
confluence
is
light
bodied
and
tart
with
great
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
and
the
aroma
is
really
great
certainly
not
one
of
allagashs
best
efforts
good
stab
at
a
wild
ale
and
not
something
they
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
yet
interested
in
trying
the
bottled
release
later
on
but
not
in
a
hurry
to
drink
again
still
worth
trying
3
85
tasted
like
a
spicy
yeasty
funky
single
belgian
pale
taste
is
of
the
mentioned
aromas
with
more
lemony
zest
coming
through
with
a
floral
and
honey
flavors
with
a
mild
hoppiness
coming
through
poured
a
meidum
and
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
small
sized
head
aromas
of
brett
that
came
out
more
and
more
as
i
drank
this
one
fruity
earthy
citrus
and
some
yeast
tastes
of
citrus
earthy
spices
and
some
brett
light
to
medium
tart
finish
with
the
tartness
of
the
fruits
in
the
beer
the
drinkabity
is
much
like
a
white
wine
slightly
syrupy
i
really
liked
the
overall
flavor
and
appearance
of
the
beer
and
suggest
that
if
you
are
somewhere
it
is
on
tap
order
it
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
smells
good
but
is
too
bitter
for
my
taste
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
few
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
apple
and
slight
clove
taste
is
complex
starts
a
bit
sweet
and
fruity
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
a
bit
of
pepperspice
along
the
way
natural
carbonation
gives
it
a
bubbly
but
still
smooth
and
at
times
buttery
mouthfeel
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
wellbalanced
and
fairly
complex
very
enjoyable
slight
effervescence
wonderful
notes
linger
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
sometimes
it
can
be
hard
for
american
brewers
to
do
these
belgian
styles
justice
but
this
one
seemed
to
have
just
about
everything
that
the
style
should
have
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
very
crisp
prickly
pretty
dry
on
the
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
just
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
half
the
bottle
is
enough
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
the
carbonation
might
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
just
what
i
expect
from
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
little
brighter
than
it
was
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
only
recommend
it
if
your
a
big
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
was
still
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
think
for
an
american
example
of
the
style
its
better
than
most
its
not
a
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
while
its
not
a
favorite
of
the
style
it
was
one
of
the
better
american
ones
ive
had
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
keep
it
up
this
is
a
complex
beer
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
classic
probably
not
fair
to
call
it
an
american
version
as
it
could
have
easily
come
from
belgium
if
the
bottle
said
otherwise
reminiscent
of
st
bernardus
tripel
bit
overpriced
but
very
good
this
is
a
crisp
clean
beer
the
aroma
has
a
slight
fruitiness
a
slight
bite
and
a
light
maltiness
the
flavor
light
yet
rich
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
there
is
a
slight
undertone
of
banana
which
i
expect
more
in
a
triple
but
isnt
unwelcome
here
all
in
all
im
very
impressed

have

just
a

reminds
me
a

of

quite
good
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
local
2
is
so
good
but
this
one
was
kind
of
meh
it
did
nothing
to
distinguish
itself
from
other
belgian
strong
pale
ales
just
not
my
type
of
beer
awesome
bottle
tastes
great
and
very
true
to
style
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
by
far
the
best
ive
tasted
from
that
brewery
it
is
well
balanced
and
really
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
complexity
othis
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
find
it
to
be
very
well
balanced
and
really
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
whether
you
want
to
argue
its
a
farmhousesaison
or
a
belgian
strong
ale
it
doesnt
matterthis
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
get
again
for
sure
the
reason
i
give
this
beer
a
3
75
is
because
of
the
alcohol
bite
im
sure
it
is
extremely
hard
to
hide
the
9
abv
in
this
style
but
it
hits
you
pretty
hard
on
the
first
few
sips
and
sticks
around
for
a
little
bit
longer
than
id
like
other
than
that
an
extremely
good
beer

color
and
aroma
are
impeccable
an
absolute
winner
it
should
match
perfectly
with
dessert
or
cheese
after
a
nice
dinner
very
champagne
flavor
saison
ale
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
too
farmhouse
for
me
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
had
somewhat
high
expectations
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
probably
exceeded
them
a
very
well
done
close
to
perfectly
balanced
beer
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
stronger
than
id
like
nothing
jumps
out
to
grab
you
and
that
to
me
is
just
fine
well
done
bottled
in
2011
i
like
this
style
opening
it
filled
the
room
with
a
banana
aroma
heavy
on
the
banana
taste
as
well
super
thick
rich
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
not
heavy
on
the
carbonation
little
flat
seems
like
the
age
didnt
help
or
hurt
this
beer
much
although
i
did
not
have
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparison
enjoyable
but
not
a
rockstar
total
3850
citrus
and
butterscotch
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
tone
of
alcohol
with
some
herbs
and
citrus
again
a
well
made
belgian
strong
ale
outstanding
belgian
brew
o
either
way
as
a
strong
saison
or
a
belgian
strong
pale
this
beer
is
fantastic
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
fruity
soft
champagne
pear
apricot
loved
it
overall
just
boring
blah
not
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
here
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
probably
wont
ever
make
it
into
my
rotation
of
belgians
to
buy
regularly
o
an
excellent
brew
great
mouth
feel
very
mellow
in
taste
definitely
a
belgian
style
beer
bought
in
boca
raton
drank
on
deerfield
beach
july
15
2014
the
taste
is
lovely
with
its
toasted
barley
malt
character
sugar
and
maybe
brown
sugar
sweetness
chewy
belgian
yeast
low
hops
and
overall
complex
character
well
worth
the
8
65
i
paid
for
it
i
could
drink
this
regularly
o
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
approved
letting
this
one
warm
a
bit
is
a
good
idea
nice
complexity
each
sip
is
a
little
different
offering
different
combinations
of
many
different
flavors
and
characteristics
the
most
dominant
flavors
are
bread
based
but
it
is
accented
wonderfully
by
everything
else
yet
another
one
of
those
beers
best
consued
in
the
hot
months
oft
he
summer
as
it
is
truly
refreshing
an
impressive
offering
to
say
the
least
mouthfeel
was
good
for
style
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
listed
as
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
had
elements
of
a
saison
which
is
a
style
i
am
really
starting
to
enjoy
o
not
a
bad
bspa
as
i
already
mentioned
it
tastes
like
a
really
heavy
saison
imperial
saison
maybe
has
that
typical
grassy
citrus
cloves
combination
just
a
touch
of
funk
but
barely
loses
a
bit
of
the
crispness
of
a
lighter
saison
at
the
same
time
good
but
not
earth
shattering
overall
great
beer
cant
remember
where
i
got
this
one
but
i
have
tended
to
enjoy
brooklyn
beers
and
belgians
so
i
am
guessing
that
i
will
enjoy
this
one
good
looking
beer
golden
and
cloudy
with
good
head
that
stuck
around
good
nose
but
not
overwhelming
crisp
but
not
much
of
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
taste
is
very
good
and
smooth
considering
the
alcohol
content
has
a
light
taste
and
feel
despite
being
at
9
which
gives
it
good
bonus
points
not
great
but
very
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
depending
upon
the
cost
which
i
cannot
remember
would
like
to
try
it
again
with
the
2
on
the
same
night
to
compare
and
contrast
which
would
help
me
narrow
down
my
top
styles
o
its
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
interesting
complex
very
good
o
for
a
light
coloredbodied
strong
ale
it
had
a
very
pleasent
smell
and
taste
an
amazing
beer
and
one
that
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
the
price
tag
for
once
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
given
the
strength
of
it
was
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
belgian
beers
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
in
the
past
this
one
is
a
must
try
and
i
look
forward
to
sourcing
a
bottle
of
their
brooklyn
local
2
sometime
soon
o
a
delightful
bspa
worth
a
try
and
buy
fans
of
the
style
will
be
sure
to
appreciate
it
leans
toward
the
sweetwet
end
of
the
spectrum
enjoyable
to
be
sure
this
is
certainly
a
well
crafted
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
earthshattering
and
maybe
my
expectations
were
a
bit
high
going
in
very
well
balanced
with
a
light
farmhouse
character
and
plenty
of
light
pilsner
malt
chewy
toffee
also
on
the
finish
great
beer
and
well
worth
having
but
wont
be
in
my
top
ten
for
the
style
i
think
i
would
prefer
a
more
assertive
flavour
profile
to
match
the
abv
while
this
accomplishes
a
near
graceful
balance
to
each
their
own
i
suppose
still
very
good
when
i
eventually
got
down
towards
the
bottom
i
added
the
sediment
which
added
some
nice
bite
and
spice
o
i
like
this
beer
would
be
better
without
the
carbonated
finish
o
very
complex
beer
that
gives
you
many
aromas
and
taste
enjoyed
it
o
very
soir
and
fruity
i
guess
it
is
expected
with
this
style
has
an
almost
artificial
taste
its
that
fruity
way
to
sour
for
me
wasnt
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
just
to
sour
and
fruity
for
me
worth
the
try
but
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
one
again

very
good

not

but
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
belgian
replica
by
an
american
brewer

rich
very
belgian
but
not
the
real
stuff
but
still
very
rich
overall
foamy

decent

thanks
ba
for
killing
me
again
delete
the
review
if
you
want
but
i
urge
you
to
fix
the
site
first
guys
prost
o
i
bought
this
along
with
a
local
2
on
a
recent
trip
to
ny
i
would
agree
with
the
categorization
of
strong
saison
as
i
found
it
very
saisonesque
i
enjoyed
the
mouth
feel
and
look
of
this
beer
and
it
was
a
nice
enjoyable
drink
i
would
revisit
it
but
not
as
fast
as
i
would
local
2
overall
one
of
the
better
strong
belgian
ales
ive
tried
particularly
impressive
because
its
american
could
easily
pass
for
a
fine
belgian
ale
if
you
are
into
this
style
you
will
really
enjoy
it
but
i
dont
know
if
it
is
something
id
rush
to
buy
again
o
solid
beer
from
a
solid
producer
for
a
great
price
very
nice
domestic
version
of
a
true
belgium
if
blind
folded
i
would
never
have
known
strong
sweet
tasting
malts
alcohol
strength
is
masked
well
smooth
and
no
bitterness
and
improved
as
it
warmed
simple
golden
color
with
powerful
carbonation
poured
in
my
regular
pub
style
pint
glass
from
the
big
corked
bottle
very
nice
enjoyed
it
for
a
hour
and
half
would
definitely
buy
again
drink
at
home
dont
drive
overall
this
may
be
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
i
just
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
little
tamer
im
not
going
to
downgrade
it
too
much
though
as
the
taste
was
very
good
o
this
is
a
dead
ringer
for
a
bush
blond
a
great
example
of
a
strong
belgian
ale
even
if
it
was
brewed
in
brooklyn
rather
than
belgium
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
not
blended
as
smoothly
and
dont
have
as
much
depth
as
the
classic
examples
but
this
is
a
great
beer
like
so
many
from
brooklyn
just
such
a
clear
representation
of
style
solid
classic
enjoyable
overall
man
i
love
this
beer
draft
or
bottle
you
cant
go
wrong
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
too
o
best
to
serve
this
one
at
a
cold
temperature
chilled
its
fizziness
counteracted
the
sweetness
and
warmer
it
became
drier
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
carbonation
a
rocksolid
duvel
clone
not
as
good
but
not
terribly
far
off
this
bottle
will
get
killed
solo
nutty
fruity
taste
but
spicy
hint
of
spiced
peaches
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
like
a
champagne
overall
so
this
is
what
everyone
is
ranting
about
when
they
talk
about
brooklyn
brewery
products
i
have
heard
so
much
yet
have
never
experienced
it
for
myself
i
am
glad
to
see
the
beer
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
may
send
my
copy
of
the
oxford
beer
encyclopedia
to
garrett
oliver
to
have
him
sign
it
this
is
one
excellent
beer
strongly
recommended
condor
approved
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
almost
mundane
for
the
style
which
is
why
i
tend
to
prefer
the
strong
dark
ales
again
not
bad
because
i
would
drink
again
but
would
not
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
forthis
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
its
a
lower
quality
beer
than
aureus
by
draai
laag
brewing
now
admittedly
i
am
a
pittsburgher
that
likes
local
crafts
but
i
bought
local
1
pranqster
and
la
fin
de
mondes
a
total
wine
while
visiting
a
friend
just
outside
of
delaware
because
they
are
very
highly
rated
on
beer
advocate
none
of
these
three
beers
is
as
good
and
complex
as
aureus
so
yes
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
deserves
a
high
score
but
i
prefer
unibrouwe
and
draai
laag
despite
the
100
ranking
from
the
brothers
overall
a
great
belgian
this
is
a
great
american
take
on
the
style
superbly
balanced
and
drinkable
price
a
little
high
otherwise
a
solid
overall
beer
drank
with
a
lot
of
non
craft
beer
drinkers
and
they
loved
it
if
that
says
anything
o
good
beer
well
above
average
but
not
great
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
pours
a
copper
color
with
very
active
carbonation
and
a
resilient
head
smells
maltygrainy
with
a
subdued
belgian
yeast
character
tastes
very
malty
bread
and
honey
mild
noble
hop
finish
yeast
character
is
pretty
restrained
a
bit
sweet
but
dries
up
in
the
finish
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
blonde
biere
de
garde
alcohol
strength
is
wellhidden
mouthfeel
is
very
fluffy
and
frothy
prickly
carbonation
goes
well
to
keep
this
refreshing
in
spite
of
the
high
alcohol
i
found
this
at
halfprice
as
my
grocery
store
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
them
good
buy
for
the
money
but
i
dont
know
if
id
pay
10
for
this
at
regular
price
o
a
very
nice
bspa
with
quite
the
kick
very
complex
with
many
layers
a
great
bottle
to
split
at
dinner
in
lieu
of
wine
and
probably
one
that
suits
most
people
including
wine
fanatics
definitely
recommended
overall
i
think
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
top
strong
belgian
pales
at
under
10
a
bottle
its
a
good
buy
too
highly
recommended
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
one
of
the
best
american
ones
out
there
this
imo
could
stand
toe
to
toe
with
anything
coming
out
of
belgium
and
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
many
that
do
a
great
beer
at
a
really
good
price
overall
a
very
good
belgian
style
ale
good
zesty
fruit
flavors
with
a
good
amount
of
funk
and
grainy
malt
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
belgian
that
is
surprisingly
strong
not
overly
complex
but
very
solid
d
an
exceptional
belgian
strong
pale
ale
other
then
a
mouthfeel
that
only
rises
to
the
level
of
very
good
everything
else
about
this
brew
is
excellent
one
of
the
best
american
interruptions
of
the
style
ive
encountered
i
can
highly
recommend
and
attest
that
ill
be
indulging
in
this
fine
brooklyn
offering
in
the
future
i
really
liked
this
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
style
thats
hard
to
do
well
and
even
when
its
done
well
is
only
ever
going
to
hit
a
certain
level
i
described
above
the
basics
of
every
belgian
strong
ale
ive
ever
tried
some
of
them
do
the
job
better
of
course
but
it
never
really
departs
too
much
from
that
blueprint
that
said
this
is
a
very
persuasive
attempt
its
gold
it
carries
a
solid
finger
of
whites
and
a
brilliant
clarity
smells
of
carbonation
belgian
yeast
some
sweet
grain
some
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
household
dust
flavor
is
grain
sweetness
some
hints
of
flowers
and
a
bit
of
corn
alongside
a
dose
of
belgian
pale
yeast
body
is
thin
on
medium
with
hi
carb
and
a
bone
dry
finish
i
have
to
drink
water
every
time
i
taste
the
beer
thats
just
too
much
another
beer
from
brooklyn
another
strikeout
particulary
because
the
mouthfeel
is
just
soo
much
to
overcome
for
a
high
abv
this
beer
has
great
taste
and
finish
i
had
it
at
anthonys
coal
fired
pizza
in
miami
with
my
salad
and
pizza
pie
it
was
a
great
compliment
to
a
good
meal
also
the
price
was
excellent
figure
you
get
3
glasses
of
beer
versus
ordering
3
beers
it
is
a
great
value
a
high
fluffy
head
floats
atop
a
pale
yellowamber
clear
elixir
the
nose
is
more
floral
than
fruity
the
beers
physical
character
is
an
accomplished
balance
of
thirstquenching
prickliness
and
foamy
smoothness
taste
apricots
it
has
to
be
classed
as
sweet
but
completely
free
of
cloyingness
the
beer
is
refreshing
but
substantial
its
lighter
i
suppose
than
the
estimable
maredsous
tripel
with
which
it
shares
stature
but
in
a
good
way
put
me
down
as
a
fan
quite
good
overall
3
5
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
interpretations
of
the
style
i
cant
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
if
im
gonna
be
spending
that
kind
of
money
on
a
beer
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
o
all
aspectws
of
this
beer
come
together
to
create
a
really
superb
ale
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
i
was
happy
to
have
this
750ml
bottle
to
myself
and
happy
to
have
bought
a
few
more
at
the
same
time
to
share
with
others
at
a
later
date
overall
a
rather
nice
drinking
belgian
style
strong
ale
it
had
a
good
flavor
profile
and
transitions
with
it
even
at
9
abv
being
very
easy
to
drink
a
quite
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
i
recommend
this
belgian
for
a
warm
summer
evening
props
go
out
to
brooklyn
brewery
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
brooklyn
a
great
version
of
the
style
and
i
hope
to
drink
it
again
overall
not
a
ton
of
experience
with
this
style
but
definitely
a
solid
beer
damn
fine
this
beer
is
unreal
and
a
steal
for
under
9
bucks
the
pour
is
a
little
hazy
sunny
yellow
with
over
an
inch
of
thick
white
head
that
lasts
the
whole
glass
and
leaves
a
fine
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
saisony
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
thought
with
the
sugar
listed
theres
something
grassy
and
outdoorsy
about
this
lovely
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
sorachi
ace
but
with
some
different
hops
its
got
the
same
champaigney
yeast
vibe
and
belgian
essence
balanced
as
anything
not
too
sugary
not
too
hoppy
just
a
near
perfect
golden
ale
with
a
little
summer
thrown
in
this
brings
me
somewhere
far
away
from
my
upstate
new
york
kitchen
in
december
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
light
but
not
watery
body
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
invisible
alcohol
this
blew
my
mind
and
is
up
there
with
sorachi
ace
as
some
of
brooklyns
best
work
i
cant
wait
to
get
this
again
the
culinary
matchings
are
endless
as
well
what
a
quality
brew
o
a
really
delicious
fruity
and
bready
dry
belgian
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
has
a
very
complex
vaguely
german
yeast
character
almost
like
a
weizenbock
in
many
respects
coupled
with
a
big
dry
fruity
belgian
backbone
drinkable
and
enjoyable
strong
saison
strong
belgian
pale
whatever
it
may
be
this
beer
is
awesome
o
this
one
is
tasty
its
a
nice
different
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
strong
belgian
pale
ale
which
ever
you
want
to
call
it
it
really
is
hard
to
call
this
a
strong
one
considering
the
way
the
9
abv
is
hidden
i
like
the
sweetness
mixed
with
the
mild
funk
and
the
added
bonus
of
the
wheat
banana
aroma
flavor
hats
off
to
brooklyn
overall
drinkability
a
very
rich
tasty
and
well
balanced
beer
here
full
of
belgian
goodness
and
many
nice
flavors
the
alcohol
is
not
notable
at
first
but
it
shows
up
in
force
later
while
you
should
sip
and
savor
it
has
that
great
pull
of
flavor
that
can
lead
one
to
drink
it
faster
than
you
should
so
while
i
know
for
me
it
should
be
one
is
enough
i
am
quite
glad
i
had
a
big
duvelsized
glass
of
this
when
i
split
the
bottle
with
the
mrs
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
but
a
very
good
one
overall
o
i
cant
do
this
and
a
good
34
of
the
bottle
was
a
drain
pour
way
too
much
of
that
belgian
flavor
choking
the
hell
out
of
me
terrific
belgian
pale
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
it
will
pick
up
again
o
defintiely
worth
a
try
in
the
line
of
duvel
with
some
additional
lemon
sweetness
a
great
beer
to
complement
a
hearty
meal
poured
into
snifter
with
think
white
head
which
thinned
out
in
about
a
minute
nice
lacing
though
hazy
amber
color
with
lots
bubbles
darting
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
mostly
of
fruits
and
some
grain
with
some
faint
spices
the
nose
is
good
but
not
as
strong
as
others
ive
tried
taste
balanced
and
thin
nothing
is
overpowering
fruity
flavors
up
front
mango
or
apricot
and
apple
i
think
but
the
finish
is
a
little
more
grainy
all
of
the
fruit
flavors
are
subtle
and
not
overpowering
there
is
a
definite
bitter
bite
that
stays
with
you
for
a
while
but
its
more
subtle
than
others
ive
tried
the
taste
it
leaves
behind
is
like
apple
juice
this
has
a
medium
light
mouthfeel
but
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
when
i
took
a
sip
was
how
carbonated
it
is
its
like
drinking
a
fountain
soda
pop
fizzy
on
the
tongue
then
it
thins
out
quickly
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
recommend
trying
it
overall
i
think
that
this
a
pretty
good
belgian
pale
ale
i
recommend
at
least
once
i
personally
do
not
care
much
for
fruity
beers
but
i
think
that
this
one
gets
right
and
i
might
buy
another
one
in
the
future
poured
into
goblet
this
belgian
ale
pours
out
a
nice
nutty
and
burnt
orange
color
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
head
thats
just
creamy
and
billowy
the
body
is
mildly
hazy
and
filled
with
carbonation
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
shows
no
signs
of
fading
any
time
soon
theres
a
thick
wall
of
lacing
that
just
seems
to
corral
the
bubbles
together
the
aroma
overall
is
wheaty
with
some
mild
spices
citrus
fruits
and
even
raisin
its
very
crisp
overall
slightly
bitter
when
it
hits
the
sides
of
your
mouth
and
it
does
have
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
in
the
background
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
filled
with
spices
and
hops
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
this
one
tends
to
emphasize
the
fruit
and
pepper
profile
nearly
no
hop
presence
at
all
a
pretty
good
beer
but
falls
just
short
of
being
a
great
one
overall
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
the
abv
goes
not
my
first
pick
but
will
definatly
drink
again
tasted
from
a
0
3l
victory
snifter
pours
with
a
vigorous
healthy
head
of
white
foam
small
bubbles
rising
through
the
slightly
hazy
light
amber
colored
beer
tropical
fruit
light
maltiness
and
slight
funk
in
the
nose
spicy
yeastiness
too
fruit
carries
thru
the
taste
as
well
not
too
much
hop
bitterness
for
a
belgian
p
a
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
malty
sweetness
though
light
alcohol
noted
too
finishes
nice
and
subtle
with
no
one
component
dominating
not
too
bad
but
ive
had
better
in
this
style
did
i
mention
its
sweet
one
of
the
sugariest
beers
ive
done
heard
of
but
it
keeps
banging
that
note
until
my
fingers
turn
blue
what
pretty
good
beer
price
point
8
99750ml
bottle
oda
unique
bpa
not
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
tried
it
without
needing
to
buy
a
bottle
but
i
would
not
shell
out
over
10
for
a
bottle
of
this
not
really
for
me
but
i
respect
the
liquid
craftsmanship
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
but
i
must
say
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
even
for
the
style
big
and
tasty
yes
a
refreshing
quaffer
decidedly
not
a
must
try
for
most
any
beer
drinker
so
smooth
o
this
is
a
different
take
on
belgian
beer
it
has
plenty
of
that
cool
funky
belgian
yeast
flavor
but
for
me
the
sweetness
just
did
not
fit
well
with
the
belgian
funk
this
bottle
was
sampled
at
alltomölfestivalen
2012
eskilstuna
sweden
very
refreshing
great
carbonation
very
drinkable
smoothe
and
drinkable
that
9
is
hidden
extremely
well
beer
is
in
a
25
oz
bottle
purchased
for
10
bucks
poured
into
an
18oz
schooner
it
has
a
thick
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
nothing
special
about
the
smell
its
sweet
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
dominate
sweet
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
where
the
beer
is
something
special
its
medium
body
with
wonderful
small
bubble
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
so
good
its
notable
overall
this
beer
is
true
to
the
style
and
something
i
will
purchase
again
i
would
buy
this
again
and
share
it
as
it
seems
to
be
a
very
good
beer
for
hot
summer
months
o
really
enjoyable
a
bit
of
age
certainly
hasnt
hurt
this
one
overall
the
booze
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
had
a
complex
flavour
this
bottle
was
a
few
years
old
and
its
held
up
well
it
had
a
lot
of
white
wine
qualities
to
it
worth
seeking
out
its
a
good
beer
but
not
great
the
mouthfeel
is
what
held
it
back
for
me
again
its
good
just
not
great
a
little
spicy
for
me

review
on

nice
work
from
brooklyn
again
poured
into
my
free
stella
artois
chalice
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
a
two
finger
head
of
tiny
bubble
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
smells
of
stonefruit
banana
green
apple
and
pepper
the
taste
is
great
nice
and
clean
with
a
good
belgian
funk
it
is
of
medium
medium
and
finishes
nicely
this
is
a
mighty
fine
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
best
beer
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
brooklyn
local
1
the
bottle
says
in
williamsburg
brooklyn
we
forge
barley
malt
and
hops
from
germany
aromatic
raw
sugar
from
mauritius
and
yeast
from
belgium
into
brooklyn
local
1
behind
the
golden
color
find
a
dynamic
complex
of
flavors
belgian
flair
brooklyn
fortitude
and
a
dusting
of
yeast
after
100
bottle
fermentation
enjoy
it
locally
or
globally
as
an
aperitif
or
with
your
favorite
dishes
oone
of
the
bests
beers
to
bring
to
an
event
with
non
beer
drinkers
the
beer
went
over
great
at
easter
dinner
note
this
bottle
was
stored
in
a
refrigerator
for
24
years
prior
to
opening
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
has
a
nice
smell
and
taste
that
is
complex
but
not
overpowering
but
could
do
with
a
little
more
carbonation
in
my
opinion
this
beer
was
amazing
750
ml
bottle
the
taste
was
fresh
but
pleasant
fruity
but
complex
absolutely
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
a
good
beer
to
store
in
the
basement
for
a
special
occasion
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
alcohol
content
that
is
really
unnoticeable
i
cannot
say
enough
about
this
brew
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
a
fruit
aspect
as
it
was
being
poured
into
the
chalice
the
aroma
was
estery
and
fruity
through
the
white
moussy
head
and
contained
a
very
well
done
earthy
and
lightly
spicy
character
sweet
candy
with
a
nice
peppery
backbone
floral
and
fruity
rule
the
day
the
golden
elixir
was
lightly
hazy
in
the
chalice
but
the
white
moussy
head
lasted
very
well
to
lace
the
glass
the
flavor
was
very
very
nice
with
a
prominence
of
pepper
well
balanced
with
a
malty
light
candycaramel
the
flavors
worked
very
well
together
with
a
moderate
level
of
bittering
and
an
earthy
and
lightly
grassy
hop
presence
which
kept
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
the
body
was
medium
full
and
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
the
finish
was
just
dry
with
lasting
fruit
and
pepper
spice
long
and
pleasant
into
the
aftertaste
and
beyond
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
with
a
slight
presence
in
the
nose
and
then
a
decent
level
of
warming
that
occurred
post
consumption
this
is
indeed
a
beer
to
seek
out
well
done
and
very
enjoyable
1
pint
9
4
ounce
corked
and
bailed
bottle
o
this
is
n
awesome
belgian
ale
well
put
together
with
great
aromas
and
flavors
overall
i
had
tried
this
years
ago
when
it
was
first
release
i
didnt
like
it
i
thought
id
giveer
another
shot
in
2012
i
didnt
like
it
an
excellent
classy
and
beautifully
executed
belgian
pale
that
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
o
a
beautiful
beer
with
rich
flavors
and
lots
going
on
less
fruity
than
the
local
2
and
a
really
really
nice
beer
the
best
thing
ive
tasted
from
brooklyn
by
far
overall
decent
and
slightly
different
but
the
spice
is
a
bit
much
and
needs
some
food
for
balance
some
yeast
bite
throws
things
off
a
bit
too
o
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
belgians
brewed
in
the
u
s
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
the
carbonation
is
extremely
fine
and
mousselike
great
texture
as
a
caveat
to
any
reader
i
will
confess
i
have
never
had
this
beer
fresh
before
i
have
very
little
experience
with
aged
beer
with
that
said
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
bottle
of
beer
despite
there
being
i
suspect
some
oxidative
flavour
in
it
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
fresh
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
a
great
deal
with
the
unintended
cellaring
ive
subjected
it
to
overall
the
best
belgian
style
ive
ever
had
it
being
one
of
my
least
favorites
this
one
sat
well
with
me
though
the
execution
was
excellent
and
this
beer
brought
a
lot
to
the
table
o
amazingly
enjoyable
it
just
seemed
to
have
the
right
balance
of
light
malt
and
complex
fruitiness
with
a
kick
of
hops
i
am
immediately
seeking
this
one
out
to
try
again
o
other
than
it
almost
killing
me
and
scaring
the
hell
out
of
fiancee
i
enjoyed
it
its
not
as
top
notch
as
the
local
2
but
that
is
like
comparing
apples
and
oranges
overall
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
drink
and
it
has
absolutely
met
my
expectations
flavors
play
with
each
other
in
your
mouth
carbonation
is
great
makes
you
think
that
someone
took
a
lot
of
time
putting
this
together
like
a
good
meal
or
argument
i
was
really
blown
away
by
this
one
id
put
it
right
up
there
with
the
greats
such
as
duvel
o
great
beer
especially
for
price
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
a
dinner
as
an
alternative
to
wine
o
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
american
bspas
its
quite
refreshing
and
interesting
to
drink
o
a
delicious
brew
id
definitely
drink
another
great
great
beer
i
realised
it
was
rated
highly
on
ba
but
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
o
awesome
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
that
good
it
was
just
perfectly
balanced
for
being
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
o
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
but
interesting
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
a
real
nice
brew
has
some
note
that
i
just
couldnt
put
a
definitive
finger
on
but
enjoyed
them
nonetheless
love
the
bombers
from
brooklyn
overall
great
beer
overall
overall
you
just
got
everything
one
of
the
specimens
ever
brewed
i
always
have
numbers
in
mind
when
judging
a
beer
and
this
is
brooklyn
brewerys
finest
no
lie
take
it
for
what
it
is
it
is
not
soda
or
your
really
good
flavored
beer
it
is
for
what
it
is
real
beer
overall
an
awesome
belgian
strong
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
and
highly
recommended
o
this
is
a
solid
belgianstyle
pale
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
example
i
prefer
the
local
2
but
this
is
enjoyable
too
a
flawless
american
version
of
the
style
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
so
far
from
brooklyn
deep
orange
massive
white
rocky
head
good
retention
and
lacing
yeasty
with
notes
of
spice
lots
of
tropical
fruit
sweet
candy
notes
nice
hop
bill
adding
some
citrus
fruit
faint
alcohol
scents
taste
is
of
spicy
yeast
lots
of
fruit
apple
mild
banana
more
of
the
tropical
fruits
from
the
nose
light
sweetness
that
ends
in
a
drying
finish
high
prickly
carbonation
full
body
with
good
weight
incredibly
solid
stuff
very
drinkable
and
quite
flavourful
better
than
most
belgian
pales
from
belgium
overall
drinkability
pretty
legit
no
off
characters
whatsoever
a
little
more
complexity
would
have
been
nice
but
the
beer
is
still
great
as
is
served
from
bottle
into
goblet
glass
at
refrigerator
from
the
first
pour
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
world
class
beer
it
pours
with
a
huge
slowlydissipating
head
which
is
about
as
thick
as
a
beer
can
have
the
aroma
is
faintly
of
the
trademark
raw
sugar
with
a
subtle
noble
hop
presence
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
subtle
the
flavor
is
similarly
subtle
with
malt
and
raw
sugar
presiding
over
noble
hops
this
would
be
an
uneventful
beer
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
it
is
well
about
as
perfect
as
you
can
expect
to
find
the
closest
competition
is
duvel
and
they
are
evenly
matched
this
is
highly
recommended
the
5star
rating
was
long
pondered
it
is
not
given
lightly
the
truth
is
that
after
finishing
the
whole
bottle
i
cannot
find
fault
pale
gold
in
color
and
rather
cloudy
a
gentle
pour
of
roughly
ten
ounces
into
a
tulip
leaves
about
an
inch
of
foam
that
doesnt
appear
to
be
going
anywhere
the
majority
of
the
smell
seems
to
come
as
a
result
of
the
yeast
as
in
the
nose
i
get
a
great
deal
of
ester
ranging
from
fruity
citrus
to
spicy
cloves
that
is
backed
by
a
solid
pale
malt
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
and
some
slight
alcohol
the
good
score
is
because
i
expected
a
bit
more
strength
the
taste
follows
the
nose
things
start
out
quite
spicy
with
pepper
like
flavors
on
top
of
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
wraps
up
slightly
bitter
as
the
beer
warms
and
i
get
deeper
into
the
bottle
more
of
the
yeast
esters
and
flavor
come
out
creating
a
dynamic
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
light
and
almost
effervescent
as
the
fine
carbonation
makes
it
feel
as
though
this
beer
floats
in
the
mouth
the
alcohol
does
become
apparent
though
it
is
mainly
through
a
great
warming
sensation
and
never
cloying
or
overly
oppressive
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
this
is
a
tough
style
to
separate
oneself
from
the
crowd
as
there
are
many
world
class
offerings
but
this
beer
does
manage
to
hold
its
own
within
that
crowd
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
soft
light
appearance
but
with
a
great
head
not
much
lacing
though
nose
is
a
floral
and
sweet
malty
combo
flavor
is
subtly
sweet
on
a
baked
bread
base
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
food
pairing
grilled
fish
or
chicken
with
grilled
vegetables
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
even
my
girlfriend
and
her
friends
love
it
and
they
hate
beer
very
nice
clean
fruity
taste
i
will
be
buying
one
of
these
to
age
overall
its
a
solid
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
but
hey
i
try
them
with
an
open
mind
nonetheless
cloudy
yellow
tint
with
a
frothy
head
adequate
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
molasses
maltiness
coriander
lemon
peel
and
sour
apple
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
brown
sugar
and
apple
intermingled
with
earthy
spices
surprisingly
it
seems
light
for
the
alcohol
and
flavor
as
it
coats
the
mouth
this
brew
exceeded
my
expectations
o
disclaimer
im
not
a
big
pale
ale
fan
but
have
to
hand
it
to
brooklyn
on
this
effort
found
it
very
hard
to
set
down
smooth
and
flavorful
with
just
enough
carbonation
and
citrus
to
hide
the
9
creamy
and
full
i
will
be
having
another
one
of
these
shortly
overall
like
other
belgian
style
ales
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
its
a
solid
example
of
a
strong
bpa
trying
this
back
to
back
with
the
local
2
its
hard
to
say
which
one
was
better
they
both
serve
their
own
unique
purpose
and
are
completely
world
class
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
us
beers
the
balance
and
carbonation
are
done
extremely
well
o
really
a
toptier
beer
worth
the
price
of
admission
for
sure
overall
i
cant
believe
i
waited
to
long
to
finally
try
this
beer
i
was
very
impressed
with
it
o
among
the
bspas
ive
tried
this
ranks
right
up
there
behind
duvel
at
the
top
its
got
everything
you
want
in
a
highquality
strong
ale
its
just
a
shame
that
its
not
available
in
4
or
6packs
just
the
large
wine
bottle
size
good
for
sharing
though
highly
recommended
a
solid
aa
in
my
book
have
had
numerous
times
before
i
joined
ba
and
acutally
sat
down
to
review
it
o
this
is
a
good
belgianstyle
ale
another
fine
ale
from
brooklyn
enjoyed
it
a
lot
thought
it
as
more
of
a
saison
though
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
awhile
so
thanks
taturbo
on
the
fence
if
id
ever
buy
it
this
is
really
good
garrett
oliver
seriously
knows
how
to
manage
yeast
and
produce
a
stunning
belgian
ale
the
dried
out
malt
is
great
without
it
becoming
bland
and
the
yeast
is
really
nice
o
unbelievably
good
im
so
impressed
third
time
thru
on
this
one
apearance
is
outstanding
great
rocky
head
that
disapates
slowly
mouth
feel
is
rich
and
just
enough
bitters
to
keep
me
into
this
beer
not
that
im
regionally
biased
but
this
guy
has
me
buzzing
or
maybe
its
watching
adam
scott
destoy
the
field
in
akron
at
any
rate
damn
good
beer
high
carbonation
light
bodied
and
the
alcohol
flavor
is
front
and
center
i
wish
it
could
have
been
better
disguised
a
good
beer
but
does
not
measure
up
to
the
best
bspas
o
great
brew
very
refreshing
nice
example
of
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
brooklyn
hit
it
out
of
the

big
bubbly
white

that
lingers
a
half
inch
thick
in
the
glass
after
a
big
pile
on
the

on

of
an
old

brightens
to
a

like
a

the

extremely
well
balanced
and
bouncy
fun
beer
that
i
will
savor
through
the
night
as
soon
as
i
opened
this
the
cork
wanted
to
fly
off
like
a
champagne
cork
but
all
under
control
and
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
two
finger
rocky
sudsy
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
very
belgian
with
aromas
of
fruity
floral
hopsdoughy

candy
and
candied
pearsthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
and
quite
creamy
with
tastes
of
candied
pearsboiled
candywhite
grapesdoughy
bread
and
finished
with
a
floral
bouquet
hoppy
sweetness
and
overall
its
a
tasty
drop
that
would
be
beautifully
suited
to
seafood
very
nice
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
that
is
reasonably
pleasant
on
the
palate
less
than
i
expected
overall
o
a
good
offering
but
sort
of
1
sided
not
complex
still
good
o
i
thought
this
was
a
saison
oh
well
still
an
extremely
tasty
beer
that
id
probably
buy
again
perhaps
not
on
the
level
of
a
duvel
but
certainly
an
excellent
ale
paired
swimmingly
with
the
lobster
a
very
good
beer
not
at
the
top
of
the
list
but
it
will
not
disappoint
overall
a
solid
beer
not
worth
the
big
price
in
my
opinion
but
definitely
something
worth
going
for
overall
i
seem
to
prefer
the
local
2
over
this
since
it
has
more
spice
and
orange
tones
rather
than
heavy
yeasts
but
it
was
still
worth
the
try
if
only
to
uncork
may
not
have
again
o
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
i
could
drink
a
few
glasses
even
considering
the
abv
overall
i
think
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
i
was
expecting
something
awesome
but
i
didnt
quite
get
it
if
the
carbonation
and
the
bitter
finish
were
toned
down
a
bit
i
would
like
it
a
whole
lot
more
its
worth
a
try
though
outstanding
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
a
strong
saison
extremely
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
trying
local
2
d
the
lingering
finish
might
slow
you
down
but
overall
an
enjoyabledrinkable
beer
o
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
was
a
lot
more
like
a
saison
for
me
and
a
pretty
good
one
my
first
broolyln
beer
except
for
the
brooklynschneider
hopfenweisse
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
especially
local
2
only
negative
that
i
would
say
is
the
carbonation
is
a
little
over
the
top
o
a
big
beer
that
is
very
belgian
with
a
pale
ale
compliment
the
hop
character
is
generally
subtle
but
does
linger
abv
is
well
hidden
here
overall
finally
i
get
to
have
an
american
made
belgian
strong
pale
golden
ale
that
actually
rivals
the
belgian
heavy
hitters
such
as
duvel
and
delirium
tremens
goose
island
matilda
is
more
like
orval
so
i
am
not
counting
that
just
mentioning
that
because
i
love
matilda
great
stuff
overall
another
great
beer
from
brooklyn
i
will
buy
many
of
these
and
will
do
my
best
to
share
the
bottle
although
it
will
be
difficult
not
to
drink
it
all
brooklyns
local
1
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellowish
orange
with
ample
white
head
that
does
not
dissipate
very
quickly
and
laces
minimally
it
smells
great
with
ample
spice
initially
and
aromas
of
bready
malt
banana
and
some
citrus
finishing
out
the
nose
local
1
is
big
on
taste
with
nice
malty
breadiness
lemon
and
more
spice
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
great
feel
very
crisp
slightly
dry
carbonation
is
great
and
the
overall
result
is
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
brooklyn
brewery
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
hazy
looking
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
yeasty
has
a
bit
of
citrus
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
floral
and
hoppy
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
bread
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
light
even
for
the
strength
of
the
brew
it
leave
a
dry
feel
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
belgian
yeast
with
some
lemons
coriander
and
orange
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
nice
wheat
and
bread
malt
notes
with
some
pepper
and
coriander
as
well
as
some
belgian
yeast
orange
and
lemons
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium

m

some
carbonation
along
with
some
alcohol
warmth
is
great
for
cleansing
the
palate
some
biscuity
qualities
as
well
as
it
lightly
coats
the
tongue
and
mouth
solid
drink
even
a
newbie
can
appreciate
o
very
good
and
enjoyable
all
the
way
around
someone
brought
teh
local
1
and
local
2
to
teh
beer
tasting
party
that
we
have
about
once
a
quarter
the
color
was
a
golden
cloudy
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
led
to
good
white
head
there
was
not
much
smell
other
than
hints
of
grain
the
taste
was
quite
nice
fortified
by
clove
and
spice
the
flavors
are
all
well
balanced
even
with
the
higher
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
hurt
somewhat
by
the
high
abv
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
its
a
5
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
out
of
the
ballpark
with
this
one
55
bravo
overalli
would
say
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
between
two
big
beers
to
cleanse
the
palate
but
this
is
a
pretty
damn
big
beer
im
halfway
through
and
can
feel
it
overall
a
great
and
nicely
balanced
brew
o
brooklyn
brewery
provides
an
excellent
introduction
to
a
style
which
might
not
necessarily
be
appealing
to
the
masses
the
beer
is
really
tasty
but
it
was
slightly
drier
and
spicier
than
others
ive
had
from
this
category
my
palate
adjusted
midbottle
and
i
noticed
i
was
throwing
this
back
pretty
easily
not
sure
if
brooklyn
plans
on
expanding
to
the
west
coast
but
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
this
on
my
next
trip
to
ny
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
has
a
great
spiciness
to
it
as
well
as
some
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
it
looks
great
when
poured
and
feels
and
smells
great
as
well
my
first
perfect
score
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
pours
a
golden
yellow
small
bubble
head
smells
yeasty
fruity
tastes
of
slightly
sour
peaches
has
some
sweetness
yeast
is
balanced
just
a
crazy
good
beer
has
some
floral
notes
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
overall
awesome
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
brooklyn
brewery
and
beers
like
this
is
the
reason
why
new
to
the
bottle
fermented
style
of
this
white
ale
exceptional
taste
refreshing
and
layered
taste
notes
complex
feel
and
quality

the
beer
is
harrder
to
find
but
worth
the
hunt
my
favorite
new
beer
this
year
i
will
look
forward
to
the
sarachi
ace
and
local

and
has
a

with
a
a

of
flavor
for
this
style
of
beer
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
forgot
that
it
was

malty
sweet

and
a
little
sticky

too
drinkable
at

for
the

it
slows
you
down
to
a
very
enjoyable
crawl
smells
like
a
real
belgian
ale
and
taste
like
one
too
absolutely
delicious
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
this
brewery
before
but
if
this
is
representative
of
what
they
produce
im
a
fan
poured
into
a
tulip
clear
vibrant
gold
champagne
effervescence
is
apparent
in
the
white
bubbly
head
its
not
unlike
anyhitng
ive
ever
seen
before
smells
of
light
tropical
fruitiness
and
dry
malt
away
we
go
pinch
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
they
must
be
full
of
b
s
that
this
is
9
or
im
dreaming
if
you
told
me
this
was
from
an
abbey
in
belgium
id
never
think
twice
dry
apples
pears
and
a
wee
bit
of
peach
the
malt
is
dry
too
almost
like
an
unsalted
cracker
the
hops
are
playing
hideandgoseek
here
but
deliver
a
bit
of
spice
here
and
there
and
it
all
melts
together
with
finally
a
tiny
hint
of
estery
alcohol
but
surely
not
hinting
at
9
this
beer
is
easy
in
a
complex
way
cheers
overall
a
very
pleasant
tasty
and
refreshing
belgian
style
brew
from
garret
oliver
another
homerun
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
i
never
thought
i
would
like
a
beer
that
favored
the
phenolic
side
of
belgian
yeast
but
this
one
is
all
right
d
a
must
try
everyone
should
experience
this
clinic
of
an
american
influenced
belgian
pale
cheers
overall
a
great
beer
this
is
definitely
an
example
of
a
belgian
beer
being
done
well
outside
of
belgium
i
would
be
very
happy
if
it
was
regularly
available
here
in
ontario
overall
not
bad
the
flavors
are
nice
but
theyre
not
very
strong
it
might
be
a
little
too
subtle
bought
this
corked
bottle
at
whole
foods
in
new
york
city
the
bottle
and
presentation
remind
me
of
a
fire
station
for
some
reason
this
beer
was
very
belgian
influenced
a
lot
like
chi
may
in
appearance
and
a
stout
9
alcohol
content
this
beer
was
made
for
slow
playing
not
a
whole
lot
of
sediment
but
still
full
bodied
a
great
beer
made
here
in
the
states
is
a
must
try
for
any
lover
of
the
trappist
belgian
style
beers
pours
pale
orange
with
a
thick
rich
white
head
that
lasts
through
the
glass
aroma
of
tart
malt
and
apricot
with
some
creamy
yeast
taste
of
crisp
malt
and
yeast
a
bit
onedimensional
a
bit
of
fruity
tartness
mixed
with
the
yeast
which
is
smooth
taste
is
a
pretty
subdued
for
a
strong
ale
i
expected
much
bolder
flavors
very
smooth
and
clean
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
but
it
really
doesnt
have
powerful
flavors
quite
impressive
for
a
beer
of
this
gravity
to
be
this
smooth
and
clean
but
i
would
rather
have
it
taste
stronger
in
more
ways
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
leading
to
a
very
effervescent
mouthfeel
finish
is
dry
but
some
residual
sweetness
is
left
on
the
palate
making
for
a
nice
sipping
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
a
beer
that
walks
the
line
of
being
a
strong
pale
or
a
saison
quite
well
ill
have
to
agree
with
mr
oliver
though
strong
saison
is
a
perfect
descriptor
im
digging
belgian
pales
id
say
brooklyn
1
lived
up
to
my
expectations
it
is
a
gorgeous
beer
i
wish
for
more
hopping
and
perhaps
a
stronger
nose
but
very
well
done
mouthfeel
if
fairly
light
and
quite
dry
overall
a
very
refreshing
ale
not
quite
belgian
in
style
but
with
a
nice
yeast
presence
not
bad
at
less
than
10
for
a
750ml
bottle
either
overall
a
great
strong
ale
with
a
medley
of
components
coming
together
for
one
really
fantastic
tasting
brew
which
does
a
nice
job
of
concealing
the
high
alcohol
content
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
flavor
that
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
drink
quite
of
few
of
these
before
i
land
on
my
bum
from
the
high
abv
drinkability
a
really
good
representation
of
a
belgian
but
very
sweet
not
sure
if
i
would
have
more
than
2
glasses
or
a
750
well
done
brooklyn
d
pretty
decent
especially
for
the
abv
might
go
for
again
in
the
summer
overall
b
this
is
a
great
food
pairing
beer
and
has
lots
of
applications
for
that
even
on
its
own
to
drink
its
very
refreshing
however
this
isnt
an
anytime
beer
for
me
of
this
style
but
is
still
a
real
well
done
product
good
take
on
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
brew
easier
to
drink
than
some
d
if
you
can
get
past
wasting
half
the
beer
in
foam
form
its
drinkable
but
there
just
isnt
as
much
there
as
others
in
this
style
putting
this
one
in
the
pass
pile
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
definitely
worth
sharing
save
for
a
special
occasion
but
though
it
should
cellar
for
a
few
years
dont
cellar
for
too
long
this
one
is
meant
to
be
consumed
fairly
young
and
its
definitely
tasty
that
way
a
little
bit
thin
and
overcarbonated
even
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
alcohol
is
too
formidable
even
after
some
time
to
age
and
there
isnt
enough
fruitiness
or
spiciness
to
really
make
this
stand
out
for
me
there
are
many
other
widely
available
bspas
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
d
goes
down
fast
no
booze
so
easy
to
down
for
a
9
a
real
treat
and
an
exceptional
beer
for
an
event
or
special
party
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
very
complex
in
flavor
theres
tropical
fruits
and
spices
up
front
i
get
mixture
of
pineapples
and
banana
with
some
cloves
sweet
bready
malt
in
the
middle
but
very
clean
tasting
i
notice
there
some
yeasty
and
peppery
notes
in
the
taste
finish
off
pretty
dry
yet
its
very
smooth
alchohol
is
well
hidden
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
it
was
very
light
in
flavor
overall
but
the
flavors
that
were
there
made
for
an
excellent
beer
the
carbonation
made
it
very
bubbly
and
the
belgianish
fruity
sweetness
apricot
was
underlying
throughout
the
highlight
of
the
beer
though
is
the
hop
spice
unlike
most
hoppy
beers
local
1
ale
did
not
have
much
bitter
taste
instead
it
was
spicy
almost
like
nutmeg
it
tingled
the
tongue
just
enough
to
give
the
beer
that
extra
goodness
to
make
the
beer
stand
out
this
leaves
a
dry
finish
that
goes
well
with
the
spicy
hops
flavor
it
also
has
a
strong
but
not
overwhelming
alcohol
taste
to
it
but
that
is
to
be
expected
because
of
the
9
abv
if
you
want
a
light
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
that
has
some
alcohol
kick
then
this
is
a
bottle
you
should
pick
up
d
very
good
drinkability
abv
not
noticable
seems
like
a
great
beer
to
have
for
a
special
occasion
very
well
balanced
and
such
a
wide
aroma
of
flavors
it
should
appeal
to
most
crowds
this
was
described
by
most
that
were
in
this
tasting
as
a
mix
of
a
saison
and
a
hefe
dr
hides
its
abv
exceptionally
well
too
dry
to
drink
repeatedly
nice
appearance
foamy

hold
strong
and

yellow
in
color
nice
looking
smells
wonderful
similar
to
how
i
expect
an
achouffe
to
smell
true
belgian
yeast
flavors
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
considering
the
respectable
abv
i
split
the
22oz
champagne
bottle
three
ways
comfortably
and
would
gladly
drink
again
really
nothing
local
tasting
about
the
beer
but
quite
delicious
nicely
done

i
am
actually
a

disappointed
this

doesnt

theres
also

comes

d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
before
dinner
and
goes
just
as
well
with
so
many
different
foods
drinkability
is
the
same
as
a
champagne
if
you
can
drink
that
all
night
you
could
do
the
same
with
this
theres
enough
complexity
to
urge
you
to
take
another
sip
but
its
very
smooth
and
subtle
overall
im
in
love
with
this
beer
seriously
i
only
wish
it
was
a
little
cheaper
so
i
could
afford
to
drink
it
all
the
time
also
for
what
its
worth
i
tried
adding
a
little
twist
of
lemon
i
know
heresy
but
i
had
to
try
and
not
only
did
it
not
improve
the
beer
it
actually
skunked
that
particular
glass
of
it
i
found
this
to
be
a
particularly
interesting
beer
it
poured
somewhat
orange
and
smelled
strong
of
yeast
with
some
fruit
notes
there
too
taste
was
began
spice
with
some
malt
notes
following
the
alcohol
began
becoming
apparant
after
a
few
swigs
but
it
wasnt
overwhelming
it
was
a
very
smooth
beer
given
the
alcohol
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
in
some
ways
it
reminded
me
of
saison
duponts
flavors
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
of
its
style
and
certainly
the
best
americanmade
one
d
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
for
9
abv
it
is
a
smooth
drinking
bspa
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
there
are
other
belgian
beers
out
there
that
are
far
superior
to
this
really
solid
effort
from
brooklyn
here
apart
from
the
appearance
this
is
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
or
anything
but
it
does
everything
right
if
you
like
bspas
then
definitely
seek
this
beer
out

tastes

a
revisit
brooklyn
brewery
local
1
from
07
was
next
this
was
a
rare
treat
especially
since
we
dont
get
brooklyn
beers
up
here
in
wisconsin
my
friend
jon
mentioned
that
the
shape
of
the
bottle
was
unique
to
the
first
run
of
local
1
before
new
belgium
stepped
up
and
cried
copyright
infringement
i
havent
looked
up
the
details
my
notes
start
getting
a
little
bit
hard
to
read
around
this
beer
but
i
remember
thinking
it
was
an
awesome
a
big
sweetness
and
an
almost
coffeelike
roast
to
it
made
me
feel
that
if
i
has
tasted
this
blindfolded
i
would
have
describes
a
more
darkbodied
beer
i
wished
there
was
more
of
this
in
that
bottle

this
beer
is

carbonation
helps
dry
it
out
even
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
would
be
better
if
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
smoother
and
subtler
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
d
great
for
predinner
and
with
a
meal
i
prefer
this
to
local
two
by
a
smidge
an
american
combination
of
various
central
european
ale
brewing
tropes
and
yet
rendered
without
a
heavy
stateside
hand
so
kudos
on
that
good
stuff
and
enjoyable
with
no
overwrought
hop
or
booze
wallop
which
helps
turn
attention
to
a
more
and
intended
im
sure
belgian
strong
ale
association
worthy
of
all
the
sturm
und
drang
there
is
a
german
component
here
wafting
about
right
now
drinkability
very
smooth
flavorful
brew
it
definitely
has
more
of
a
kick
than
something
like
duvel
which
is
quite
enjoyable
particularly
on
a
cold
winter
evening
about
halfway
in
a
felt
a
nice
warming
sensation
in
my
stomach
for
what
it
is
the
price
is
incredible
and
i
would
definitely
be
tempted
to
purchase
this
drink
again
great
special
offering
by
the
brooklyn
brewery
d
alcohol
content
is
understated
not
too
filling
complex
but
in
a
straightforward
way
thats
very
approachable
has
a
generically
familiar
taste
to
it
in
that
these
are
some
quintessential
flavors
in
a
style
thats
done
as
close
to
perfection
as
possible
d
really
quite
nice
one
of
the
better
brooklyn
beers
ive
tried
drink
a
solid
5
really
my
1st
offering
from
brooklyn
and
thanks
to
my
bro
in
law
for
bringing
this
from
dc
for
his
holiday
trip
i
have
local
2
in
the
fridge
ill
pop
that
tonight
i
paid
nine
dollars
for
the
big
bottle
which
is
an
ok
price
would
buy
again
a
wellmade
beer
time
to
get
back
to
the
brewery
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
wipes
clean
any
lacing
on
the
glass
this
would
make
for
a
nice
aperitif
or
an
accompaniment
to
seafood
i
am
looking
out
for
the
local
2
as
of
now
drinkability
one
of
the
better
belgian
ales
by
a
u
s
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
this
also
brooklyn
brewery
has
some
of
the
best
looking
bottles
just
thought
id
say
it
d
great
summer
time
saison
type
ale
this
beer
pops
beautifully
in
the
mouth
full
on
flavor
all
at
once
the
sting
of
carbonation
hits
hard
and
releases
multiple
flavors
at
once
in
perfect
harmony
nice
full
chewey
grain
taste
backed
by
citrus
and
fresh
floral
and
greens
finnishes
dry
leaving
your
mouth
craving
more
an
excellent

another
great
complex
beer
from
brooklyn
overall
i
liked
this
one
i
was
impressed
by
its
drinkability
it
tastes
very
smooth
and
refreshing
a
solid
american
take
on
the
belgian
style
d
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
overall
a
long
time
favorite
that
i
wish
i
could
get
with
more
regularity
certainly
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
even
with
its
strength
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
a
good
apertif
and
finishing
just
about
the
whole
bottle
was
not
a
problem
d
ok
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
the
flavors
are
geared
around
that
alcohol
pair
with
some
earthy
cheeses
and
darker
breads
to
balance
the
beer
out
had
to
pair
it
up
with
brooklyn
style
margherita
pizza
would
work
with
seafood
as
well
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
the
fruity
taste
is
nice
but
it
has
high
carbonation
not
a
good
point
with
me
also
has
high
alcohol
content
and
you
can
smell
and
taste
that
not
a
good
combo
in
a
fruity
carbonated
beer
definitely
do
not
let
this
beer
warm
or
the
alcohol
will
take
over
totally
also
this
didnt
need
to
come
in
such
a
big
bottle
you
cant
shouldnt
drink
all
that
yourself
at
9
if
they
could
tone
down
the
carbonation
it
would
really
help
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
astringency
and
yeast
is
a
slight
amount
distracting
but
nothing
bad
this
is
an
exceptional
belgian
beer
period
it
is
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
very
complex
in
flavor
hoppy
estery
fruity
it
is
amazing
what
the
belgian
yeast
can
do
this
beer
was
a
joy
to
drink
i
liked
even
more
than
local
2
which
i
had
first
have
this
beer
with
dinner
or
just
enjoy
it
with
a
friend
it
is
a
pure
treat
pours
out
cloudy
with
a
nice
white
head
golden
color
and
some
carbonation
smells
yeasty
and
grainy
with
a
hint
of
wheat
malt
sweetness
bananas
grains
and
a
citrusy
backblast
of
hops
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
syrupy
medium
overall
on
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
very
good
and
it
makes
me
cheery
notes
dont
know
why
i
overlooked
the
local
1
2s
for
so
long
glad
i
bought
both
yesterday
d
great
belgian
quite
an
incredible
take
and
ill
be
back
for
this
one
its
a
sipper
but
makes
a
great
companion
while
watching
the
patriots
knock
off
the
ravens
in
ot
i
really
cant
fault
local
1
in
any
way
d
this
is
a
pretty
complex
drink
with
a
higher
abv
one
bottle
sufficed
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
balanced
ale
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
plus
the
bottle
is
as
cool
as
any
ive
seen
d
a
great
beer
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
though
a
heavy
pale
ale
well
done
brooklyn
very
good
equal
to
some
of
the
best
belgians
i
took
the
cage
off
after
letting
the
bottle
sit
outside
the
fridge
to
come
to
temperature
then
i
got
a
little
surprise
as
the
cork
gave
a
good
pop
and
the
bottle
did
a
little
gusher
pours
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
small
but
persistant
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
some
small
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeasty
malt
bread
dough
grass
and
a
little
fruit
flavor
is
a
little
on
the
dry
side
at
first
and
then
yields
to
a
mild
sweetness
like
the
nose
and
does
go
great
with
a
variety
of
foods
body
is
soft
and
carbonation
is
robust
and
a
good
match
for
the
beer
finish
has
duration
is
like
the
flavor
and
leaves
a
sense
of
satisfaction
well
done
maybe
not
a
session
beer
though
one
finger
pure
white
head
small
bubbles
medium
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
golden
orange
body
a
bit
cloudy
chill
haze
several
streams
of
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
glass
nose
is
fairly
fruity
meyer
lemons
coriander
more
fruity
than
spicy
the
taste
mirrors
nose
pretty
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
fairly
dry
finish
due
to
yeast
strain
decent
effervescence
pretty
drinkable
though
the
sweetness
effects
drinkability
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
heat
fairly
well
hidden
abv
kick
this
beer
certainly
straddles
the
line
between
bspa
and
a
saison
doesnt
fit
neatly
into
either
category
given
the
relatively
high
price
point
i
think
next
time
ill
seek
out
pranqster
or
damnation
or
a
real
bspa
fairly
tasty
but
imo
not
that
great
overall
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
brooklyn
lager
so
for
the
longest
time
i
havent
given
brooklyn
a
fair
chance
so
i
am
glad
to
be
checking
out
their
other
offerings
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
hands
down
the
best
belgian
style
ale
brewed
in
the
us
to
date
all
other
american
brewers
that
are
thinking
about
brewing
belgian
style
ales
need
to
take
notice
a
lobster
roll
on
a
gilled
bun
with
a
side
of
shoestring
fries
and
mayo
is
the
ultimate
pairing
d
the
amount
of
bitterness
dryness
and
spices
makes
this
a
beer
that
can
only
be
slowly
sipped
92
12
points
i
really
love
this
beer
it
seems
like
more
often
than
not
im
disappointed
by
american
attempts
on
authentic
belgian
tasting
beers
and
i
think
this
one
matches
up
to
the
likes
of
duvel
and
other
types
quite
well
this
is
stuff
i
would
buy
by
the
case
if
i
had
the
cash
nice
job
brooklyn
ill
ride
the
local
1
any
time
d
an
excellent
saison
albeit
a
strong
one
wonderfully
balanced
edit
as
with
many
craft
brews
but
particularly
so
here
it
does
the
beer
a
great
disservice
to
drink
it
cold
let
it
warm
and
open
up
overall
it
is
a
decent
strong
saison
and
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
difficult
to
categorize
this
one
i
had
it
just
recently
with
a
very
warm
and
melted
brie
which
was
excellent
the
local
1
so
perfectly
cleanses
your
palate
for
each
new
taste
i
would
expect
that
this
will
work
well
with
most
all
cheese
dishes
spicy
foods
seafood
or
roasted
ham
a
nice
solid
brew
if
not
especially
inspiring
the
beer
is
very
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
high
level
of
carbination
overall
a
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
another
great
beer
from
brooklyn
dense
foam
with
high
durability
and
nice
lacing
aroma
citrus
floral
malty
and
orange
the
taste
lost
points
for
be
extremely
sweet
but
has
great
fruity
notes
bitter
and
herbal
bitter
end
much
hops
and
spicy
i
noticed
a
more
pronounced
flavor
of
yeast
and
sweet
while
the
temperature
of
beer
increased
bringing
greater
complexity
to
the
beer
both
in
aroma
and
in
flavor
beautiful
beer
pours
a
murky
light
orange
colour
with
huge
white
head
as
the
head
dissipates
it
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
clove
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
almost
like
a
saison
has
small
amount
of
bitterness
to
go
with
delicious
belgian
yeasty
flavour
great
carbonation
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
had
this
with
duck
confit
and
it
went
great
together
drinkability
this
beer
seems
like
it
should
be
so
much
better
between
the
massive
head
the
relatively
weak
smell
and
the
overpowering
alcohol
something
is
definitely
off
about
this
one
as
i
noted
in
most
areas
the
beer
mellows
out
a
bit
but
my
first
impression
definitely
wasnt
good
this
beer
gets
better
as
you
drink
a
bit
more
but
i
still
expected
it
to
be
good
throughout
i
expect
this
one
hasnt
shelved
very
well
despite
refridgeration
or
i
got
a
bad
bottle
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
though
if
it
remains
so
terrible
at
the
beginning
ill
stick
to
local
2
d
drink
it
slow
taste
is
sharp
and
dry
with
tons
of
carbonation
an
a
huge
mouthfeel
very
rich
and
spicy
excellent
with
spicy
food
into
a
stemmed
brooklyn
glass
poured
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
nearly
three
fingers
of
bright
white
with
fantastic
head
retention
and
great
lacing
banana
clove
lime
lemon
bubble
gum
coriander
vanilla
caramel
and
modest
orange
peel
were
all
detected
in
the
nose
impressive
mix
the
taste
began
with
a
lean
towards
citrus
and
bubblegum
followed
by
a
more
fruitymaltcaramel
balance
and
finished
on
a
dry
bitter
orange
peel
note
spritzy
yet
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
only
the
feintest
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
very
nicely
drinkable
belgianstyle
specimen
a
nice
beer
from
brooklyn
id
like
to
share
this
with
others
next
time
also
im
looking
forward
to
trying
brooklyn
local
2
solid
offering
from
brooklyn
a
bit
sweeter
than
what
youll
find
with
duvel
one
cant
help
but
compare
the
two
but
that
only
adds
to
its
uniqueness
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
i
like
this
and
imagine
it
would
work
well
as
a
food
pairing
brew
overall
brooklyn
local
1
is
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
reach
the
higher
level
belgian
styles
flavor
is
very
good
at
first
this
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
finish
is
actually
quite
dry
with
rubbery
yeastiness
and
solid
hop
bitterness
malty
sweetness
reminiscent
of
butter
cookies
and
caramel
combines
with
a
fruity
estery
flavor
a
la
orange
banana
and
tart
apples
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
funk
that
hints
at
the
saison
style
but
i
would
say
this
beer
is
correctly
classified
in
the
belgian
strong
ale
category
the
alcohol
content
makes
the
drink
pretty
warming
as
does
the
peppery
spicy
character
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
effervescent
though
the
body
is
not
too
overwhelmingly
heavy
for
a
high
octane
beer
i
appreciate
how
this
lighter
feel
contributes
to
drinkability
still
tastes
like
an
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
but
nevertheless
very
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
great
beer
this
beer
has
been
aged
for
just
a
little
over
a
year
now
though
so
i
will
have
to
try
to
find
a
fresher
version
to
see
how
it
compares
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
an
ebullient
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
smell
is
a
tad
spicy
and
very
full
grains
are
up
front
with
the
spices
and
fruit
in
the
background
a
bit
of
a
zesty
character
hidden
in
the
mix
as
well
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
full
and
bready
drinkability
is
very
high
murky
dark
gold
in

thick
foamy
marshmallow

citrus

with

carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel

spiced

that
feels
as
if
it
were
brewed
abroad
but
was
done
nicely
in
bk
cheers
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
a
reasonably
well
made
beer
it
went
down
easily
and
i
would
have
no
problem
with
purchasing
another
that
said
i
think
that
duvel
has
nothing
to
fear
from
this
or
any
of
its
competitors
medium
body
with
quite
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
dryness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
taste
is
subtle
and
balanced
with
light
malts
green
apple
pear
and
tangerine
a
hint
of
mustiness
and
spice
a
moderately
dry
finish
that
is
crisp
and
smooth
due
to
the
very
active
carbonation
abv
is
so
well
hidden
that
its
more
in
the
nose
than
in
the
taste
overall
a
nice
rep
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
perhaps
but
a
good
beer
dits
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
the
creamy
head
remained
for
the
whole
beer
and
it
was
just
an
easy
beer
to
drink
d
tasty
beer
the
taste
has
a
yeasty
efforvescence
and
a
slight
pricklish
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
so
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
as
the
cork
is
ready
to
shoot
across
the
room
the
candied
sugars
the
belgian
florals
and
the
slight
coriander
and
orange
peel
star
anise
flavors
are
present
there
is
a
nice
pineappley
flavor
and
enough
spice
and
abv
to
keep
things
honest
the
beer
is
relatively
complex
although
not
extensively
so
with
plenty
of
candied
flavors
throughout
not
much
lacing
going
on
and
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
slight
the
beer
hides
its
9
abv
quite
well
2
5
d
this
beer
wasnt
executed
well
but
maybe
local
2
will
be
better
overall
another
great
beer
from
brooklyn
its
frightening
how
good
garrett
oliver
and
his
team
are
at
making
amazing
ales
and
lagers
goes
down
crisp
and
clean
but
with
a
classic
belgian
character
overall
brooklyn
local
1
is
a
fine
beer
whether
you
want
to
call
it
a
bspa
or
a
saison
ill
go
with
the
latter
because
thats
what
the
brewer
prefers
in
that
light
its
a
very
tasty
brew
and
an
extremely
authentic
reproduction
of
a
delicious
belgian
style
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
would
gladly
recommend
it
i
was
hoping
for
something
closer
to
saison
in
style
but
theres
no
denying
the
quality
on
show
here
notes
not
exactly
what
one
would
expect
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
rather
well
crafted
concoction
the
central
european
feel
to
the
backbone
with
the
belgium
yeast
is
unusual
but
is
equally
stimulating
not
a
fav
but
also
makes
for
a
good
quality
social
brew
with
great
presentation
d
alcohol
is
fairly
prominent
but
that
is
to
be
expected
for
a
beer
twice
the
abv
of
an
average
beer
good
drinkability
simply
based
on
the
style
not
a
session
beer
obviously
but
an
excellent
interpretation
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
by
an
american
brewery
kudos
to
brooklyn
brewery
pours
a
faded
opaque
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
despite
the
thin
head
viscous
lacing
shows
its
legs
subtle
aroma
of
citrus
malt
and
coriander
the
citrus
and
coriander
follow
through
in
the
taste
but
not
to
the
point
that
they
overpower
not
too
sweet
and
a
kiss
of
hops
on
the
palate
this
is
an
excellent
american
belgian
style
ale
the
best
ive
had
brooklyn
got
it
right
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
its
hidden
quite
well
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
delicious
drinkability
other
than
the
smell
which
i
just
didnt
get
this
was
an
awesome
beer
zach
and
i
split
the
bottle
but
i
think
i
couldve
easily
polished
one
off
on
my
own
would
love
to
try
this
again
d
a
great
sipping
brew
that
impressively
masks
a
sneaky
9
0
abv
very
well
d
good
drinkability
the
high
abv
is
always
a
detractor
but
this
beers
body
and
hopyeast
balance
make
it
very
drinkable
the
best
belgian
pale
ive
come
across
after
duvel
mouthfeel
was
good
nice
and
lively
but
finish
was
a
touch
hot
overall
this
was
nice
but
not
a
premier
example
of
the
style
d
extremely
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
sbpas
d
very
nice
abv
is
high
up
there
so
this
isnt
exactly
a
session
beer
but
it
is
lightbodied
overall
and
would
go
well
with
a
good
meal
yeasty
taste
to
it
very
sweet
belgian
beer
very
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
as
well
too
sweet
for
my
likes
but
its
high
quality
this
is
a
great
beer
the
buzz
factor
sneaks
up
on
you
doing
its
best
to
justify
the
price
i
will
get
this
again
drinkability
truely
perfect
in
this
sense
an
all
season
style
beer
for
me
and
able
to
be
paired
with
both
light
and
dark
meats
and
dishes
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
belgian
golden
ale
d
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
to
drink
much
by
itself
but
pair
well
with
equally
strong
food
followed
the
label
and
had
with
spicy
seafood
a
great
marriage
d
i
just
dont
understand
this
one
it
drinks
like
the
abv
is
way
higher
than
9
i
just
cant
get
passed
the
medicinal
booziness
qualities
they
just
dont
work
well
with
everything
else
i
expected
more
out
of
this
one
cheers
d
very
smooth
drinking
9
very
little
alcohol
is
detectable
and
doesnt
show
its
face
until
near
room
temp
id
pick
this
up
again
and
would
likely
pick
it
up
over
any
imported
belgian
strong
pale
very
nice
beer
although
it
did
not
necessarily
live
up
to
the
pomp
i
gave
it
reminded
me
alot
of
a
farm
ale
the
alcohol
was
hidden
nicely
in
the
hops
and
malts
somewhat
cloudy
pour
we
drank
it
at
the
navy
club
in
seoul
in
some
wine
glasses
which
seemed
to
suit
the
packaging
it
did
lace
to
the
glasses
and
did
seem
to
satisfy
the
beer
snob
in
us
as
a
hale
beer
well
met
will
try
again
but
maybe
not
with
such
anticipation
a
very
drinkable
ale
very
effervescent
and
quaffable
with
hardly
any
alcohol
burn
dthis
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
and
the
beer
is
pretty
big
in
terms
of
flavor
pretty
straight
forward
offering
but
quite
tasty
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
would
say
that
it
rivals
any
of
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
and
it
is
nice
coming
from
an
american
brewery
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
will
be
picking
this
beer
up
as
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
regardless
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
give
it
a
shot
regardless
but
especially
if
you
like
belgian
pales
dthis
is
a
huge
beer
that
is
certanly
meant
to
be
enjoyed
so
while
its
delicious
it
isnt
really
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
incredible
a
long
time
brew
that
ive
touted
as
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
last
couple
years
only
9
bucks
at
the
local
giant
eagle
market
district
you
cant
beat
that
grab
a
bottle
and
split
it
with
some
friends
edit
reading
the
notes
on
this
it
says
it
was
classified
as
a
strong
saison
by
g
oliver
i
can
only
say
i
completely
agree

750
ml
no
problem
abvserving
size
is
the
only
thing
holding
the
drinkability
score
back
a
notch
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
nice
and
crisp
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
quite
well

d
overall
the
high
carbonation
makes
it
more
a
sipping
beer
for
me
and
with
the
9
abv
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
at
one
time
pairs
excellent
with
some
dark
chocolate
covered
strawberries
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
for
more
of
this
one

a
beer
that
i
often
pass
up
but
for

at
the
local
whole

this
will
be
in
regular
rotation
in
the
future

i
can
take
a
taste
as
i
wait
the
head
dies
down
there
is
tremendous
thick
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
almost
smelling
like
cinnamon
applesauce
the
taste
is
very
boozy
with
a
slightly
bitter
yeasty
taste
too
strong
to
be
anything
but
a
sipper
not
really
an
exceptional
beer
and
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
md
mouthfeel
is
quite
tingly
which
is
typical
to
style
but
it
is
followed
with
a
smooth
and
rich
flavor
this
is
a
sipper
but
a
good
drinker
for
the
style

the

the

the

i
enjoy
what
brooklyn
has
done
with
this
beer
but
i
dont
feel
all
the
pieces
of
this
style
fit
together
as
they
could
it
wasnt
hard
at
all
to
finish

not

a

that
tastes

dry

i
could
have
a
couple
of
glasses
i
was
surprised
by
the
funk
this
will
not
be
the
first
drink
i
look
for
but
would
have
it
again
m
d
a
disappointing
lack
of
substance
this
brew
comes
across
as
thin
and
light
it
is
not
thoroughly
unpleasant
but
it
is
not
inspiring
and
i
dont
consider
it
to
be
successful
enough
to
drink
again
given
the
many
other
fine
options
available
dsome
of
the
flavors
here
were
just
weird
however
the
beer
is
challenging
in
a
very
good
way
aroma
is
nice
and
bready
taste
is
big
chunky
and
somewhat
sweet
lots
of
yeast

perhaps
a
hint
of
mango

a
little

mouthfeel
is
full

warm

alcohol
overall
a
very
nice
classictasting
belgian
ale
quite
good
d
although
this
can
be
according
to
the
bottle
either
an
aperitif
or
served
with
food
to
my
mind
this
really
works
better
with
food
especially
something
spicy
or
peppery
as
the
peppery
quality
of
the
beer
is
quite
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
the
bottle
whole
went
down
quickly
and
without
a
fight
a
real
solid
beer
d
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
d
can
easily
finish
the
whole
bomber
but
not
much
more
about
three
inches
of
whipped
egg
whites
for
a
head
sitting
above
a
quite
cloudy
golden
brew
all
kinds
of
scents
emanating
clove
banana
bubblegum
pepper
and
touches
of
citrus
you
can
really
smell
the
belgian
yeast
lots
of
spicy
pepper
in
the
taste
yeasty
citrus
and
some
clove
but
the
taste
seems
a
bit
conservative
when
compared
with
the
smell
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
over
the
top
and
lent
itself
to
the
peppery
sensation
on
the
tongue
i
agree
with
some
other
reviewers
about
the
medicinal
finish
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
this
wasnt
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
for
it
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
also
found
it
better
after
it
warmed
a
bit
its
not
a
beer
ill
drink
every
day
but
ill
get
another
bottle
just
to
share
it
with
friends
impression
i
keep
trying
brooklyn
because
of
the
high
ratings
of
many
beers
perhaps
no
longer
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
d
i
like
this
beer
but
a
bigger
yeast
component
in
both
the
aroma
to
make
it
more
inviting
and
in
the
flavor
to
give
a
more
nutty
smoothness
rather
than
all
the
sharp
phenolic
peppery
qualities
would
enhance
this
beer
a
lot
maybe
filtering
changes
to
allow
more
yeast
character
are
whats
needed
but
this
beer
while
beautiful
is
just
too
sharp
and
and
incohesive
drink
ability
was
good
semi
session
able
especially
for
the
high
abv
not
my
favorite
in
this
style
but
still
pretty
good
overall
pleasant
but
not
perfect
its
difficult
to
review
american
beers
in
this
style
because
it
forces
direct
comparison
to
some
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
it
doesnt
exactly
match
up
against
those
but
its
still
enjoyable
enough
that
ill
be
in
search
of
more
brooklyn
offerings
shortly
overall
a
sipper
for
sure
but
this
a
very
well
made
and
deliciously
drinkable
beer
grateful
to
have
had
the
chance
d
interesting
but
tasted
a
lot
like
tripel
ales
ive
had
before
i
was
hoping
for
an
allagash
tripel
reserve
like
taste
but
was
left
feeling
like
i
had
an
average
belgian
wit
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
saying
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
d
very
light
beer
for
the
high
abv
9
could
probably
have
1
or
2
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
as
usual
for
the
style
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
warm
alcohol
hits
you
after
a
while
but
it
goes
down
nicely
a
real
treat
for
all
the
senses
that
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
thanks
again
to
onenote81
for
this
bottle
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
anyday
great
example
of
the
style
i
love
when
an
american
brewer
makes
me
forget
where
the
beer
came
from
thanks
again
andy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
want
to
get
a
bit
buzzed
like
i
did
from
a
whole
bottle
this
would
be
a
very
nice
bottle
for
3
people
to
drink
with
some
fish
and
a
piece
of
fruit
pie
yet
another
beer
that
leaves
me
confused
listed
as
a
bspa
yet
defined
as
a
strong
saison
by
the
brewer
and
i
cant
help
think
triple
a
world
class
triple
for
that
matter
oh
well
i
can
stay
confused
with
glee
as
long
as
i
have
one
of
these
bad
boys
in
front
of
me
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
both
presenting
an
alluring
package
and
delivering
a
high
quality
beer
the
head
of
this
corked
beer
is
almost
over
the
top
however
once
it
settles
the
foam
is
exceptional
it
clings
to
the
glass
and
allows
the
smells
to
be
appreciated
the
beer
itself
is
very
drinkable
usually
these
high
alcohol
beers
offer
more
sweetness
than
i
like
that
is
not
the
case
with
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
the
local
no
1
overall
not
bad
but
i
have
had
better
belgians
ill
finish
the
entire
750
tonight
myself
i
think
it
could
be
easily
done
by
most
but
this
is
also
a
great
beer
to
share
with
a
couple
people
worth
the
try
a
decent
grapefruit
skin
color
with
a
2
finger
head
and
moderate
retention
scents
of
red
pear
cane
sugar
and
spices
a
little
touch
of
banana
but
the
citrus
and
spices
take
over
with
some
solid
carbonation
throughout
and
very
nice
semicomplex
flavors
in
the
mouth
balance
is
this
beers
strong
suit
but
it
does
it
by
thinning
out
the
beer
more
than
is
necessary
delivers
less
in
the
mouth
than
on
the
nose
d
again
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
this
is
very
drinkable
i
took
this
down
a
little
too
easily
and
definitely
was
feeling
a
bit
buzzed
afterwards
simply
superb
local
1
is
a
somewhat
disappointing
effort
from
brooklyn
brewing
its
okay
but
isnt
a
great
example
of
a
bspa
the
nose
is
weak
and
uninspired
theres
not
enough
belgian
yeast
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
little
too
strong
i
dont
know
if
brooklyn
ever
intends
to
release
this
again
but
it
needs
work
in
the
event
that
they
do
its
definitely
worth
a
try
but
for
the
price
there
are
many
better
bspa
choices
out
there
a
corked
750ml
bottle
from
the
first
batch
poured
into
my
selins
grove
wine
glass
1
appears
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
of
lingering
tightly
packed
bone
white
foam
the
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
a
very
nice
looking
pour
indeed
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
green
grapes
pears
spicy
belgian
yeast
rather
sweet
and
fruity
tropical
fruits
a
bit
earthy
and
grassy
lively
carbonation
at
first
but
that
tones
down
quite
a
bit
as
the
beer
sits
the
body
is
fulfilling
and
a
bit
slick
with
very
little
alcohol
burn
this
ale
just
keeps
getting
better
as
it
breathes
and
warms
up
take
your
time
with
this
one
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
good
but
not
great
the
initial
aroma
was
amazing
and
had
me
excited
but
the
taste
just
didnt
deliver
after
my
expectations
had
gone
up
this
still
made
a
good
sipper
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
something
ill
be
likely
to
buy
again
dremarkably
drinkable
bring
this
on
again
and
again
9
avb
really
now
added
bonus
goes
great
with
homemade
apple
pie
it
really
subdues
the
citrus
and
brings
out
the
yeast
and
tart
sweetness
d
for
me
this
was
a
slow
sipper
the
bottle
3
snifter
glasses
worth
took
most
of
the
evening
but
was
a
pleasant
change
from
the
session
beers
i
have
been
consuming
as
of
late
drinkability
yes
please
a
great
first
stab
at
a
belgianstyle
brew
by
brooklyn
always
a
brewery
towing
the
traditional
line
and
this
one
doesnt
stray
far
from
what
id
expect
or
hope
a
little
more
malty
than
i
would
perhaps
like
my
belgian
strong
pales
to
be
or
expect
them
to
be
w
my
frame
of
reference
being
the
quintessential
duvel
this
was
nonetheless
a
remarkably
crafted
brew
subtle
delicate
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
in
all
its
aspects
at
9
you
have
to
be
wary
of
drinkability
especially
w
a
750
ml
bottle
what
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
oneperson
show
i
nonetheless
made
short
work
of
it
which
is
in
and
of
itself
a
testament
to
the
quality
of
this
brew
fine
work
mr
oliver
please
keep
it
up
pours

gin
honey
melon
soap
yum
sucker
for
the
style
and
this
one
has
got
it
going
on
fine
creation
from
brooklyn
drinkability
is
about
average
for
me
the
flavor
starts
out
good
but
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bomb
and
finishes
a
little
sour
i
like
plenty
of
beers
with
high
abvs
wws
many
riss
and
barleywines
but
this
one
just
doesnt
fit
very
well
the
abv
isnt
hidden
nor
does
it
compliment
the
beer
very
well
overall
i
think
its
still
a
pretty
good
brew
but
not
one
i
would
probably
pick
up
again
kudos
to
brooklyn
brewery
for
this
offering
id
have
liked
a
little
less
carbonation
otherwise
its
up
there
with
my
standards
allday
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
day
t
very
nice
belgian
style
ale
delicious
finishes
dry
and
crisp
for
an
immensely
drinkable
belgianstyle
strong
ale
i
would
describe
this
as
a
hybrid
between
a
saison
and
belgian
golden
ale
whatever
category
it
falls
into
its
pretty
damn
tasty
d
a
nice
beer
one
bottle
is
enough
per
evening
well
balanced
and
tasted
great
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
i
cant
quite
tell
what
it
was
missing
or
what
about
it
i
that
i
didnt
love
i
cant
tell
if
its
meant
to
be
a
typical
belgian
strong
ale
or
is
just
influenced
by
the
style
maybe
the
confusion
lead
to
my
slight
disappointment
but
its
all
relative
this
is
still
a
finely
crafted
beer
in
the
grand
scheme
of
beers
other
than
the
mouthfeel
this
is
almost
a
perfect
beer
d
pretty
tough
to
drink
not
as
crisp
as
i
was
expecting
the
beer
is
good
but
not
something
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
d
a
very
different
beer
good
flavors
and
mouthfeel
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
i
recommend
not
my
first
bspa
but
certainly
demonstrates
the
diversity
of
this
style
mouthfeel
highly
highly
carbonated
just
too
much
the
beer
does
settle
down
after
a
while
i
would
recommend
letting
the
beer
sit
for
about
20
minutes
before
you
pick
it
up
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
the
beer
is
light
yellow
and
cloudy
nice
white
head
thick
at
first
but
falls
back
remains
as
a
thin
head
that
nearly
covers
the
top
of
the
glass
carbonation
is
steady
and
small
aroma
is
good
yeasty
and
sweet
a
very
attractive
beer
taste
is
a
little
bitter
surprisingly
it
is
sweet
and
a
little
dry
as
well
there
is
yeast
character
in
the
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
highly
recommend
it
verdict
to
be
perfectly
frank
after
sampling
a
few
of
brooklyns
more
mainstream
beers
i
was
starting
to
wonder
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
but
after
a
bottle
of
local
1
i
wonder
no
more
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
very
best
belgianstyle
american
beers
ive
tried
yet
pours
a
partially
clowdy
straw
yellow
slightly
orange
color
straight
out
the
bottle
has
a
huge
white
head
that
dissolves
back
into
a
thin
film
across
the
top
of
the
beverage
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
a
bit
of
yeast
and
slight
citrus
aroma
picking
up
some
other
spices
on
the
backend
as
well
taste
has
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
and
citrus
followed
by
the
yeast
and
minimal
bitterness
has
a
warming
finish
as
expected
with
the
9
abv
along
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
and
the
high
carbination
makes
this
one
have
quite
a
lighter
mouthfeel
i
think
that
this
beer
is
good
for
what
the
brewer
intended
but
the
yeast
strain
used
is
much
to
clovey
for
my
liking
quite
drinkable
whether
you
consider
it
a
bspa
or
saison
its
just
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drop
some
coin
on
a
case
of
di
felt
like
drinking
a
whole
bottle
of
this
but
i
knew
that
would
not
go
well
so
i
didnt
drinkability
im
really
enjoying
it
but
i
do
wish
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
subdued
and
the
fruitiness
had
more
of
a
presence
beyond
that
its
a
very
solid
offering
from
brooklyn
and
im
glad
i
finally
drank
this
one
im
sure
there
will
be
more
of
this
purchased
in
the
future
drinkability
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
delicate
and
beautifully
balanced
that
goes
down
with
ease
i
drank
the
first
glass
by
itself
and
the
second
pour
i
had
with
a
seasoned
roasted
chicken
it
was
nice
on
its
own
but
absolutely
sensational
with
the
chicken
definitely
one
to
have
with
a
nice
meal
particularly
lighter
fare
overall
i
was
again
very
impressed
with
a
belgian
offering
from
brooklyn
i
dont
think
this
neatly
falls
into
any
category
but
it
remains
well
worth
a
shot
notes
overall
good
appearance
flavor
and
a
fun
lively
palate
make
this
an
enjoyable
beverage
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
covers
up
the
abv
until
the
tail
end
not
bad
for
a
9
as
soon
as
it
filters
through
your
mouth
you
want
more
this
beer
is
beyond
drinkable
while
its
not
my
absolute
favorite
i
definitely
enjoy
it
and
could
drink
tons
of
the
stuff
especially
if
it
werent
9
abv
they
advertise
this
beer
being
like
a
duvel
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
its
really
not
as
good
however
when
not
compared
to
the
sacred
duvel
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
should
perhaps
be
in
other
size
bottles
beside
the
750
ml
size
would
recommend
with
caution
fantastic
this
is
a
really
got
beer
in
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
variety
trippel
fans
will
also
like
it
holds
up
very
well
against
anything
truly
from
belgium
and
i
will
look
for
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
star
anise
coriander
cloves
and
a
mild
yeasty
funk
it
is
fragrant
and
rather
complex
but
there
is
something
about
it
probably
the
plethora
of
anise
that
just
doesnt
click
with
me
the
taste
is
more
funky
than
the
aroma
with
the
anise
more
subdued
the
coriander
and
clove
are
strong
i
like
this
beers
flavor
a
little
more
than
the
aroma
but
it
still
seems
odd
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
is
not
bad
just
odd
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
i
can
tell
you
if
a
beer
is
crafted
with
quality
and
if
i
like
but
sometimes
they
arent
the
same
answer
this
beer
was
most
certainly
crafted
with
quality
and
im
sure
there
are
many
people
out
there
who
would
thoroughly
enjoy
it
however
i
do
not
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
dislike
it
i
just
dislike
this
interpretation
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
had
this
a
while
back
but
took
notes
poured
a
pal
golden
color
with
foamy
white
head
that
faded
somewhat
slowly
and
left
good
lacing
smelled
of
malt
yeast
fruit
and
spices
tasted
of
fruit
spice
yeast
light
hops
and
malt
smooth
but
slightly
overcarbed
and
left
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
bitter
feeling
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
big
bottle
three
fingers
of
gorgeous
white
frothy
head
a
hazy
light
golden
hue
is
really
inviting
wonderful
retention
and
some
fluffy
lacing
on
the
tulip
aromas
are
heavy
in
an
amalgamation
of
ripe
fruits
flavors
are
wheat
and
spice
and
incredibly
fruity
a
medium
body
and
crisp
mouthfeel
add
to
the
wonders
of
this
refreshing
beer
i
really
look
forward
to
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
one
again
pours
a
nice
pretty
golden
with
just
a
touch
of
haze
and
tons
of
very
tight
very
fine
foam
nose
is
a
nice
piny
citrusy
spicy
belgian
charactera
generally
belgian
aroma
but
definitely
a
bit
of
that
dryish
bready
german
essence
mouthfeel
is
very
light
for
the
9
abv
and
theres
also
a
robust
scrubbingbubbles
type
of
carbonation
taste
is
definitely
something
differentslight
citrus
spiciness
with
a
distinct
dry
bite
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
what
else
is
in
there
but
i
suspect
its
the
german
and
belgian
elements
mingling
very
cool
beer
and
a
great
substitute
for
a
dry
white
wine
with
dinner
i
really
liked
this
one
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
tall
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
banana
clove
spice
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
very
nice
has
a
very
nice
spice
character
to
go
along
with
the
citrus
and
clove
flavors
yeasty
flavors
are
nice
the
body
is
medium
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
at
9
nice
brew
drinkability
man
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
its
fine
i
guess
interesting
and
im
glad
i
had
it
i
hate
to
pan
something
from
a
brewery
that
i
really
like
when
they
branch
out
to
do
something
new
but
its
just
nowhere
near
as
good
as
many
other
bspas
its
also
not
cheap
at
all
nine
bucks
for
my
750
you
can
buy
a
4
pack
of
pranqster
from
north
coast
for
that
which
is
better
in
my
opinion
overall
a
solid
attempt
from
the
guys
at
brooklyn
which
is
good
but
falls
a
little
short
i
hope
to
try
the
local
2
soon
i
guess
i
already
tried
it
at
a
beer
festival
but
i
dont
remember
it
for
some
reason
effervescent
yet
controlled
with
a
perfect
body
the
alcohol
is
only
slightly
detectable
and
its
dastardly
drinkable
for
a
belgian
strong
worth
the
wait
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
serve
to
all
your
wine
drinking
friends
in
fact
i
think
its
very
similar
to
a
dry
white
wine
a
good
beer
to
serve
with
salad
or
a
nice
cheese
plate
fantastic
a
gem
a
treasure
and
a
summer
session
belgian

9

can
do

tasting
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
slight
sweet
fruits
with
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
is
sweet
fruits
and
citrus
malts
with
loads
of
spice
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
d
ok
at
best
i
think
i
dont
see
me
coming
back
to
this
one
i
picked
this
up
after
acbf
because
of
the
love
it
recieved
by
most
of
the
ba
people
around
the
booth
and
i
had
not
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
i
was
not
dissapointed
in
the
least
the
beer
had
a
good
body
to
it
very
fruity
smell
and
taste
the
after
taste
was
excellent
as
well
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sitting
on
a
porch
on
a
warm
summer
eavning
i
will
definitly
be
picking
it
up
again
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
difficult
to
detect
until
after
you
swallow
the
beer
refreshing
complex
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
to
the
bottle
lack
of
clarity
likely
has
to
do
with
the
bottle
fermentation
it
boasts
but
the
same
is
responsible
for
all
these
yeasty
notes
so
i
certainly
wont
complain
of
that
overmuch
a
very
light
peachstraw
yellow
color
billowing
white
head
beautiful
to
look
at
and
really
have
not
seen
anything
else
that
looks
like
it
great
carbonation
as
well
i
want
to
try
bottle
fermentation
so
much
going
on
when
it
hits
your
lips
starts
a
lot
like
any
belgian
and
then
picks
up
with
some
very
sweet
almost
tart
flavors
strong
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
but
still
very
smooth
to
was
down
nicely
very
easy
to
drink
but
after
a
couple
of
these
750ml
bottles
should
be
well
on
my
way
another
goodie
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
d
rather
drinkable
i
didnt
find
alcohol
to
be
too
upfront
or
offensive
like
some
other
reviewers
did
a
clean
wellbrewed
and
enjoyable
beer
that
id
definitely
buy
again
to
both
cellar
and
enjoy
immediately
d
very
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
be
careful
because
at
9
its
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
from
a
brewery
notable
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
tall
firm
and
very
stable
white
head
the
brew
has
a
a
peppery
spicy
belgian
aroma
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
character
theres
a
nice
pale
malt
backdrop
followed
by
a
little
alcohol
and
fresh
fruit
underripe
pear
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
yeast
malt
and
musty
hop
characteristics
the
beer
is
a
little
spritzy
in
the
front
but
it
quiets
down
by
the
finish
theres
a
notable
warming
in
the
taste
this
one
is
engaging
and
well
done
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
a
nice
belgian
yeast
bready
clove
spice
fuity
aroma
a
strong
belgian
ale
flavor
with
some
peppery
spice
clove
warm
alcohol
and
fruit
flavors
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
the
peppery
earthy
hop
flavors
really
popped
out
very
nice
mix
of
belgian
with
the
hops
good
mouthfeel
an
nice
high
carbonation
to
give
the
beer
a
prickly
spice
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
in
large
quantities
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
its
safe
to
say
im
not
enjoying
it
although
i
can
appreciate
it
for
following
the
style
well
and
rate
it
accordingly
if
i
never
had
this
again
i
would
not
be
upset
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
night
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
as
clear
as
i
thought
it
would
be
for
this
style
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
very
full
and
wonderful
recommend
750

brown
bottle
obtained
at

supermarket
hazy
golden
color
with
an
inch
of
off
white
head
that
holds
very
well
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
spicy
and
orange
peel
the
spiciness
orange
peel
and
the
pithy
quality
is
very
prominent
lightmoderate
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
goes
down
smoothly
very
well
made
beer
it
pours
a
honeyshaded
cloudy
gold
with
no
head
but
a
touch
of
lacing
intriguing
the
smell
is
sugar
and
flowers
i
think
those
may
be
two
of
the
ingredients
for
little
girls
the
taste
is
hops
sugar
apricots
pine
nuts
and
a
great
balance
whats
not
to
like
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
slick
it
is
quite
drinkable
very
balanced
and
doesnt
affront
you
like
some
9
beers
can
all
aboard
this
texas
boy
says
a
decent
if
slightly
boring
belgian
from
brooklyn
local
1
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
have
few
complaints
about
it
however
it
was
made
in
a
belgian
style
and
must
be
reviewed
against
its
style
which
happens
to
include
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
the
flavor
and
aroma
have
a
nice
but
fairly
generic
spice
character
of
black
pepper
and
clove
the
yeast
is
earthy
but
not
spectacularly
so
there
are
some
sweet
fruits
in
the
mix
the
feel
is
smooth
with
fine
relatively
gentle
bubbles
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
i
have
heard
maybe
from
marketing
materials
this
beer
compared
to
a
saison
and
im
going
to
disagree
with
that
characterization
its
just
a
generic
bspa
that
has
neither
big
flaws
nor
big
character
m
effervescent
and
refreshing
but
there
is
definitely
a
solid
alcohol
presence
drinkable
i
finished
the
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
but
not
without
some
effort
this
is
a
hearty
brew
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
enjoy
drinkability
this
level
of
spiciness
may
overwhelm
some
over
the
course
of
a
few
drinks
but
it
worked
well
enough
for
me
this
is
such
a
well
rounded
full
delicious
beer
pretty
much
as
delicious
as
it
gets
a
solid
brew
worth
checking
out
d
this
was
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
something
good
to
buy
to
pass
along
to
the
buddies
absolutely
spectacular
garrett
and
the
other
guys
at
brooklyn
got
this
as
a
gift
for
my
birthday
back
in
march
and
decided
it
was
time
to
crack
it
open
pours
a
huge
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
yeast
bubble
gum
and
just
a
bit
of
spice
taste
starts
off
with
strong
banana
honey
yeast
and
finishes
with
a
nice
spicy
bitterness
that
is
really
good
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
with
the
finish
it
doesnt
really
overwhelm
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
cant
wait
to
try
the
local
2
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
large
white
head
that
recedes
to
leave
a
nice
cap
no
sediment
smells
quite
spicy
with
notes
of
pepper
and
coriander
overall
sweet
fruity
character
with
quite
a
bit
of
orange
tastes
of
mineral
are
surprisingly
strong
though
quickly
overcome
by
peppery
spice
lightly
sweet
and
tangy
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
dry
finish
thats
quite
warming
highly
carbonated
a
bit
too
intense
to
be
very
drinkable
d
has
a
high
abv
and
the
750
ml
bottle
would
be
good
for
a
night
d
i
thought
it
decent
didnt
compare
to
some
other
belgian
pale
ales
like
the
delirium
tremens
but
deff
worth
a
try
d
surprised
to
see
that
its
9
after
drinking
it
very
good
for
the
style
which
is
not
my
favorite
d
pretty
drinkable
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
that
lingering
bitterness
is
not
pleasant
however
that
is
the
only
thing
that
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
a
ton
of
this
so
well
uh
is
this
a
saison
a
big
sweet
burning
one
yes
id
have
preferred
less
alcohol
more
delicacy
but
im
glad
to
have
had
this
beer
it
would
be
great
with
a
long
slow
fine
meal
perhaps
prime
rib
or
veal
this
is
a
beer
that
could
put
the
meal
on
its
shoulders
and
walk
with
it
for
a
while
whistling
d
crisp
and
dry
makes
it
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
make
it
more
of
a
sipper
than
guzzler
though
i
could
drink
this
by
myself
without
problem
something
i
will
definitely
try
again
good
example
of
style
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
drinkability
crisp
and
light
flavors
make
for
a
wellbalanced
easily
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
bear
but
at
9
abv
boy
i
wish
it
came
in
smaller
bottles
this
is
a
good
one
to
open
at
a
byob
d
im
enjoying
it
and
like
i
said
i
can
easily
imagine
having
a
distinct
craving
for
this
because
it
is
fairly
unusual
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
one
glass
will
be
plenty
for
now
d
tasty
and
flavorful
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
either
pound
for
while
or
sip
for
long
time
i
think
this
is
the
first
beer
from
brooklyn
bc
that
ive
been
impressed
with
their
other
beers
were
fermented
too
hot
and
i
didnt
like
them
at
all
but
this
one
was
obviously
handled
with
care
and
it
shows
this
can
hold
its
own
next
to
other
standout
bspas
recommended
loud
pop
from
the
cork
and
i
poured
it
into
my
standard
tasting
pint
bad
move
very
hard
to
pour
im
sorry
if
i
sound
naive
but
its
a
difficult
beer
to
control
into
a
pint
glass
as
i
let
the
head
settle
i
noticed
pear
grains
and
wheat
wafting
out
out
of
the
terribly
poured
head
the
color
is
lighter
and
hazier
than
i
expected
but
at
this
point
i
am
still
hopeful
that
that
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
ten
dollars
i
spent
at
the
brewery
for
it
i
taste
pear
and
plum
very
distinctly
and
im
underwhelmed
by
anything
else
in
this
beer
a
bit
too
watery
by
my
standards
to
be
considered
great
in
fact
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
i
was
saving
it
for
a
special
occasion
now
i
opened
it
and
i
am
left
with
a
yellow
plum
beer
that
lacks
depth
try
it
for
yourself
this
beer
hits
some
things
really
well
but
misses
the
beat
a
couple
of
times
i
think
the
mustiness
overrides
the
other
flavors
its
just
not
as
complex
as
others
like
a
really
good
beer
just
trying
to
struggle
past
the
last
few
hurdles
overall
a
solid
brew
light
and
refreshing
the
beer
is
very
balanced
with
no
one
flavor
overpowering
the
other
for
9abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
d
good
no
issues
with
the
alcohol
nor
do
any
of
the
flavors
get
in
the
way
of
each
other
or
cause
any
issues
with
enjoying
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
feel
and
drinkability
on
the
palate
this
one
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
lowmoderate
levels
of
carbonation
alcohol
warmth
adds
to
feel
giving
the
beer
some
overall
heft
finish
is
slightly
dry
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
coming
thorugh
at
the
end
to
mingle
with
alcohol
and
creating
an
overall
drying
effect
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
whilst
sweetness
still
plays
on
the
front
and
sides
of
the
tongue
until
my
watering
mouth
carries
it
away
around
the
center
of
dryness
this
is
one
that
ill
enjoy
drinking
the
rest
of
but
as
afore
mentioned
am
not
all
that
excited
about
its
a
great
beer
but
for
me
it
just
doesnt
make
me
rave
notes
i
can
imagine
having
this
alone
or
at
the
dinner
table
the
taste
is
better
similar
to
other
good
strong
pale
ales
is
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
belgians
producers
of
this
style
in
general
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
some
sweetness
with
a
tang
of
the
strongness
of
this
style
thrown
into
the
mix
drinkability
is
good
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
for
9
i
am
quite
happy
the
pour
was
average
but
the
head
1
finger
at
best
dissapated
quickly
there
was
some
impressive
bubble
dancing
to
the
top
after
each
poor
though
and
the
golden
wheat
color
was
on
par
with
others
of
this
style
it
was
the
smell
and
the
taste
that
left
something
to
be
desired
however
it
seems
as
though
there
is
little
going
on
besides
the
alchol
the
burn
seems
to
linger
inapropriately
for
a
9
00
abv
beer
and
is
way
to
present
in
the
nose
none
of
the
subtiltle
fruit
tones
i
get
in
a
duvel
i
gave
the
drinkability
a
2
5
due
to
the
bordem
induced
after
more
than
one
poor
and
the
lack
of
complexity
this
beer
was
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
seek
again
belgian
strong
ale
indeed
the
heat
in
this
one
totally
threw
me
for
a
loop
and
was
all
in
all
very
unpleasant
even
let
this
one
sit
overnight
in
the
fridge
and
despite
extra
air
time
and
cooled
state
all
i
could
get
was
alcohol
in
the
finish
not
my
cup
of
tea
which
is
a
bummer
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
overall
a
very
nice
brew
another
quality
brew
from
brooklyn
the
body
was
moderate
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
the
carbonation
was
high
even
for
style
overall
some
really
strange
off
notes
and
limited
malt
and
belgian
character
really
leaves
me
wanting
more
not
exactly
a
drain
pour

with
a
torrent
of
tiny
bubbles
effervescing
from
the
nucleation
point
in
the
well
of
the
bowl
three
inch
bright
white

sizzled
and
popped
as
it
slowly
dissipated
leaving
behind
cloudlike
formations
of
lacing
in
its
wake
nose
suggests
coriander
belgian
yeast
candi
sugar
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
anise
some
light
fruity
esters
and
a
kiss
of
booze
at
the
back
taste
follows
nose
on
this
one
great
complexity
mouthfeel
falls
between
light
and
mediumbodied
tingly
carbonation
with
no
burn
a
little
bit
of
tartness
at
the
finish
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
strong
pale
ales
easy
drinking
accessible
and
reasonable
priced
another
top
notch
brew
from
brooklyn
smooth
with
faint
resins
in
the
finish
moderate
yet
slightly
prickly
carbonation
is
fluffy
later
pours
with
yeast
haze
are
actually
creamy
even
laying
its
awesome
bottle
aside
this
is
an
beautiful
looking
beer
i
poured
it
as
gently
as
possible
into
a
white
wine
glass
and
had
barely
filled
it
one
third
of
the
way
up
with
liquid
before
the
foam
shot
up
and
filled
and
the
other
two
thirds
it
is
a
very
clear
gold
with
several
jets
of
fine
carbonation
bubbles
jetting
up
to
join
the
foam
smell
is
remiscent
of
a
saison
strong
notes
of
sour
apple
freshy
fruity
ethers
and
a
bit
of
yeast
the
warm
alcohol
vapors
were
strong
enough
on
the
palate
to
make
my
ears
pop
what
i
said
about
the
aromas
applies
doubly
to
the
taste
except
that
its
sweeter
than
the
nose
suggested
and
is
also
slightly
spicy
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
better
than
its
main
belgian
predecessors
d
local
1
is
practically
chuggable
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
amongst
a
myriad
of
flavors
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
big
bottles
when
it
comes
to
styles
like
this
but
every
sip
of
this
has
been
a
delight
certainly
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
and
easily
in
the
ranks
with
my
top
10
favorite
beers
love
it
d
amazingly
drinkable
especially
given
the
abv
of
9
m
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
drinkability
it
was
a
nice
complex
beer
that
i
felt
fit
the
style
nicely
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
honey
colored
and
slightly
hazy
poured
into
a
wine
glass
head
dissipates
quickly
into
tight
lacing
hints
of
honey
and
apricots
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
slightly
biscuity
and
yet
enough
astringency
from
the
alcohol
to
clean
and
not
strip
the
palate
very
well
balanced
and
well
described
by
the
brewer
as
a
strong
saison
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
no
suprise
that
its
high
this
brew
is
damn
tasty
i
might
have
to
go
stock
up
on
a
few
more
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
this
would
go
very
well
chilled
on
a
hot
day
or
slightly
warmer
in
the
winter
as
it
warmed
up
some
characteristics
started
coming
out
spices
and
such
but
not
over
the
top
also
the
alcohol
became
more
apparent
pours
a
transparent
golden
yelloworange
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
sturdy
14
in
net
across
the
top
of
the
brew
sweet
nose
apricot
peach
biscuitlike
yeast
and
quality
pale
malt
fruity
more
than
anything
i
remember
this
beer
being
much
more
like
a
belgian
style
golden
ale
or
tripel
more
like
a
corsendonk
abbey
pale
this
definitely
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
sweeter
fruity
and
definitely
more
american
in
nature
great
drinkability
all
the
same
would
go
excellent
with
food
d
upon
first
trying
this
beer
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
a
well
made
beer
i
echo
that
thought
here
a
very
nice
spin
on
a
strong
belgian
pale
with
a
few
saison
characteristics
as
mr
oliver
noted
i
must
say
having
previously
met
oliver
at
a
festival
that
featured
this
beer
it
is
better
in
larger
than
sample
quantities
and
warmer
than
an
iced
bottle
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
when
i
had
it
at
that
festival
but
felt
an
urge
to
review
it
ahead
of
the
release
of
local
2
md
chewy
syruoy
mouth
slightly
drying
over
all
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
for
9
abv
i
do
not
think
the
750ml
is
going
to
be
enough
i
should
have
gotten
more
when
i
had
the
chance
refreshing
pours
a
cloudy
grapefruit
color
with
a
deep
and
dense
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
all
around
the
aroma
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
expected
but
some
light
fruits
pomegranate
and
pineapple
yeast
a
bit
of
brettanomyces
and
some
slight
phenols
exist
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
bold
and
complex
with
some
more
light
fruits
including
sour
apples
yeast
spice
sugar
and
butterscotch
it
goes
down
fairly
silky
and
a
bit
dry
with
a
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
quite
drinkable
despite
its
11
0
d
at

abv
this
is
a
beer
to
be
shared
for
sure
mostly
because
a
person
could
certainly
drink
the
whole
bottle
on
their
own
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
it
pairs
incredibly
well
with
roast
chicken
and
curry
dishes
truly
a
great
beer
and
i
cant
wait
for
local
2
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
bspa
brooklyn
brewery
rarely
disappoints
with
respect
to
flavor
and
local
1
is
no
exception
crisp
neverastringent
hop
bitterness
dances
across
the
palate
balancing
perfectly
with
a
sweet
crystal
malt
and
white
sugar
note
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
yeast
department
but
still
a
fantastictasting
brew
the
body
is
wellcarbonated
and
lively
on
the
tongue
while
the
hops
kick
in
to
add
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
the
finish
somewhat
slick
smooth
body
with
a
medium
consistency
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
my
bottle
but
at
8
99
for
500
ml
i
might
opt
for
a
cheaper
belgian
pale
if
given
the
choice
the
flavor
is
where
this
beer
falters
fizzy
mouthfeel
is
good
some
bubble
gum
belgian
fruity
notes
but
then
a
dry
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
heat
that
are
disruptive
and
ultimately
overwhelming
as
i
drink
i
detect
some
tealike
flavors
looking
for
complexity
and
interest
but
any
complexity
is
overtaken
by
ashy
dry
bitterness
it
isnt
even
a
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
the
nose
of
this
brew
is
so
promising
that
the
failures
of
its
flavors
are
all
the
more
disappointing
not
bad
but
doesnt
get
anywhere
near
its
potential
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
loads
of
carbonation
little
head
though
smell
is
warm
and
fruity
rather
like
hay
on
a
warm
summer
day
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
imagine
its
actually
rather
bitter
and
slightly
acidic
fills
out
palate
well
but
is
nothing
special
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
belgian
but
a
decent
example
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
just
one
more
750ml
d
the
only
reason
this
is
a
3
0
and
not
higher
is
that
the
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
would
likely
keep
me
from
drinking
more
then
2
of
these
in
a
row
overall
i
had
big
hopes
after
the
smell
but
it
didnt
pan
out
poured
a
delicious
and
vibrant
peach
color
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
expected
and
a
tremendous
unfiltered
cloudiness
it
had
a
yeast
forward
scent
yet
mellowed
out
quite
a
bit
after
breathing
the
taste
was
clean
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
great
lingering
finish
hitting
all
the
flavors
the
most
reminiscing
flavor
was
a
bit
of
apricot
and
good
deep
cane
sugar
much
enjoyed
drinkability
is
nice
certainly
a
beer
i
would
welcome
another
bottle
of
down
the
road
but
not
one
im
pining
for
right
this
instant
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
second
shot
update
enjoyed
my
second
bomber
during
the
superbowl
and
was
glad
i
brought
it
ratings
hold
up
d
this
is
a
standout
beer
from
brooklyn
for
me
after
drinking
their
average
regular
line
up
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
take
a
seat
relax
and
enjoy
this
fine
quaff
a
warm
and
inviting
beer
for
any
brisk
fall
afternoon
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
especially
given
the
high
abv
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
enjoyable
but
not
remarkable
for
me
without
any
effort
pouring
this
into
a
pint
glass
produces
a
luxurious
thick
white
head
its
light
golden
color
looks
quite
inviting
i
smell
banana
raisin
and
other
fruits
in
the
nose
down
the
hatch
a
delicious
smooth
malt
flavor
up
front
but
quickly
followed
but
a
hot
alcohol
bite
its
lightly
carbonated
almost
playful
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
the
alcohol
bite
i
think
this
could
do
better
with
a
little
aging
but
that
will
not
stop
me
from
buying
it
again
and
soon
d
smooth
drinking
for
the
abv
d
with
the
abv
it
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
but
it
didnt
go
down
as
smoothly
for
me
because
i
t
had
too
much
of
a
champagne
type
of
taste
not
bad
but
a
lil
over
the
top
seems
kind
of
a
dumbeddown
tripel
not
as
good
as
the
belgian
examples
the
residual
sweetness
lends
heft
to
this
and
makes
it
more
of
a
sipper
but
its
by
no
means
tough
to
enjoy
awesomely
crafted
on
a
side
note
hell
of

has
multiple
printings

glass
is

the
amber

color
thick

foam
across

surface
slow

carbonation

beads

nose

with

softly
fruity
some
raw

in

ever
seeming
to
mediumbodied
has
enough
weight
upfront
to
cascade
from
thereafter
the
citrus
and
sweet
spices
even
more
prevalent
here
the
baked
character
extends
to
the
apple
pear
apricot
fruit
nuances
no
heaviness
as
it
finishes
and
the
alcohol
not
discernible
at
all
lots
of
flavor
residue
overall
this
was
not
super
amazing
for
me
but
pleasant
first
impression
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
its
slick
on
the
tongue
but
the
flavor
profile
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
i
know
it
is
described
as
a
strong
saison
not
quite
watery
and
just
might
be
to
complex
for
my
palate
to
appreciate
all
of
whats
going
on
i
think
the
fact
that
it
is
so
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
through
me
for
a
loop
thanks
to
my
mancrush
on

a

characteristics
highly

it

overall
a
fantastic
beer
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
a
tripple
very
well
made
and
an
excellent
offering
from
brooklyn
well
worth
seeking
out
i
wish
mr
oliver
would
make
this
all
the
time
highly
recommended
i
also
love
the
two
bands
of
raised
glass
on
the
bottle
reminiscent
of
those
from
westvleteren
and
other
trappist
beers
in
small
bottles
nice
tribute
pours
pale
golden
with
a
decidedly
murky
quality
from
the
yeasts
smells
of
light
lemons
and
the
yeast
of
course
taste
is
very
yeasty
especially
the
dredges
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
slight
citrus
and
alcohols
are
also
prevalent
its
not
completely
belgian
but
hey
its
not
from
belgium
and
its
a
pretty
hefty
drinker
overall
i
really
like
it
its
not
a
belgium
ale
but
i
dont
think
its
trying
to
be
one
either
more
crisp
smooth
but
with
a
hoppy
snap
poured
it
out
of
a
tall
bottle
and
it
immediately
had
a
golden
yellow
hue
lots
of
head
which
settled
after
a
while
the
smell
was
spicy
with
some
yeast
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
hops
mixed
in
as
i
tasted
the
brew
it
was
a
bit
bland
however
after
a
couple
of
more
sips
it
became
sweeter
to
the
pallate
with
the
mouthfeel
it
became
easier
to
enjoy
the
brew
as
for
the
drinkability
it
is
easy
to
finish
off
a
bottle
before
you
realize
that
you
need
more
d
this
beer
is
light
and
crisp
but
a
bit
boring
the
yeast
characteristics
were
nice
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
more
depth
is
such
a
subtle
beer
there
was
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
which
made
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
very
light
clear
straw
color
looks
lighter
than
coors
light
but
that
is
where
the
similarities
end
thick
head
of
large
white
bubbles
head
retention
is
superior
aroma
is
of
bitter
orange
peel
and
spicy
yeast
smell
is
wonderful
upon
sipping
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
medium
to
heavy
body
on
this
one
nothing
like
i
assumed
from
the
appearance
maybe
a
bit
to
heavy
for
the
style
creamy
with
more
orange
and
coriander
great
yeast
character
wonder
which
one
they
used
as
it
warms
the
yeast
takes
on
a
woody
character
spicy
and
light
bitterness
linger
long
in
the
aftertaste
dry
finish
great
beer
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
this
poured
a
big
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
but
primarily
yeast
initial
sip
offered
a
little
more
hops
than
expected
but
as
it
warmed
the
beer
became
sweeter
with
much
more
yeast
character
and
matched
the
style
well
drinkability
was
incredible
very
little
hint
of
alcohol
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
edit
when
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
is
was
classified
as
a
bspa
the
characteristics
showed
nothing
close
to
the
style
therefore
i
rated
it
a
tad
low
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
and
rereview
this
is
a
nice
brew
it
boasts
a
lot
of
flavour
and
blends
everything
together
quite
nicely
not
my
favourite
style
in
the
world
but
this
one
is
good
enough
that
id
be
more
than
happy
to
go
back
to
it
again
and
certainly
plan
to
do
so
firstly
what
is
100
bottle
reconditioned
how
could
you
have
any
other
percentage
besides
0
or
100
anyway
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
but
it
kind
of
let
me
down
it
pours
a
strawlight
amber
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
the
classic
fruity
yeasty
belgian
funky
aroma
that
i
expected
the
flavor
is
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
though
the
alcohol
is
very
evident
in
the
flavor
and
gives
a
pronounced
warming
in
my
mouth
throat
and
stomach
it
has
a
malty
fruity
taste
with
a
very
strong
spiciness
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
ultimately
very
drinkable
frightingly
so
given
the
abv
it
was
a
great
way
to
start
the
evening
i
think
it
wouldve
paired
well
with
the
crabcake
appetizers
but
we
drank
it
all
down
before
the
food
hit
the
table
overall
though
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
quite
a
difference
from
the
brooklyn
beers
youre
used
to
pick
it
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
shipped
to
me
by
sulldaddy
in
a
champagnesize
bottle
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
chilled
into
a
tulip
glass
with
some
haze
the
head
towers
above
white
loose
but
clingy
and
spongy
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
white
grapes
and
lemon
with
a
nice
amount
of
cloves
or
nutmeg
as
well
that
really
spices
it
up
just
a
twinge
of
alcohol
also
hits
my
nose
along
with
possibly
some
slight
yeast
flavor
sips
at
first
quite
sweet
with
reminders
of
pears
along
with
some
citrus
fruit
and
some
spice
alcohol
quickly
coems
in
to
dry
out
the
body
which
is
medium
at
most
with
a
slight
bit
of
yeast
flavors
the
body
again
is
medium
and
the
combined
carbonation
and
alcohol
phenols
quikly
make
this
a
bit
bitey
on
the
tongue
however
this
is
scarily
drinkable
oh
god
a
whole
bottle
all
by
myself
i
guess
ill
take
one
for
the
team
d
a
good
belgian
but
overall
not
a
great
one
imo
it
may
have
been
that
my
expectations
were
out
of
porportion
but
the
depth
was
less
than
extraordinary
it
has
the
kick
of
generous
alcholic
presence
pleasant
odors
but
the
taste
left
me
wanting
more
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
though
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
its
a
dry
sweetness
that
isnt
thick
on
the
palate
spices
orange
peel
lemon
zest
with
some
pepper
flavors
yeasty
with
slight
bready
notes
though
they
dont
leave
that
usual
chalky
mouthfeel
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
lemony
finish
that
doesnt
pucker
the
lips
spritzy
bubbles
remind
me
of
champagne
a
bit
and
tend
to
take
over
the
later
half
of
the
mouthfeel
im
not
sure
this
is
a
belgian
strong
ale
i
think
id
stick
it
under
the
saison
or
a
strong
saison
a
nice
one
from
brooklyn
poured
from
the
750ml
into
my
dfh
snifter
a
pretty
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
fat
and
frothy
thick
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
nice
foam
retention
and
some
lace
smells
malty
sweet
with
spices
and
some
citrus
maybe
cloves
a
pleasant
aroma
not
overwhelming
subtle
hints
of
peppery
pineapple
very
nice
the
taste
here
is
delicious
a
musky
malt
flavor
throughout
with
notes
of
pepper
and
clove
slight
lemon
character
in
there
has
a
dry
white
wine
quality
to
it
as
well
leaves
a
pungent
but
unoffensive
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
upon
the
finish
definitely
more
complex
and
more
enjoyable
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
true
to
the
style
for
sure
but
this
definitely
maintains
an
american
craft
brew
signature
garrett
oliver
and
company
have
done
well
with
this
one
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
although
you
know
youre
drinking
something
above
par
when
you
first
taste
this
smooth
mouthfeel
an
allaround
solid
and
drinkable
beer
nice
job
brooklyn
very
solid
offering
aftertaste
is
a
combination
of
pineapple
and
alcohol
warmths
superb
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
this
one
would
go
great
by
itself
as
a
preview
to
a
pork
dinner
definitely
pick
up
at
least
on
to
try
this
should
become
a
regular
in
brooklyns
lineup
interesting
brew
despite
the
cloying
sweetness
it
really
is
a
nice
product
pick
up
a
bottle
or
2
if
you
get
the
chance
was
excited
to
try
this
one
as
saisons
are
my
favorite
style
poured
a
straw
color
and
fluffy
white
head
that
funky
smell
was
not
present
that
i
was
expecting
along
the
saison
dupont
style
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
but
definite
spiceness
comes
through
in
the
end
i
would
try
this
one
again
but
its
a
ways
behind
saison
dupont
and
hennepin
drinkability
very
the
big
bottle
didnt
last
long
drinkability

was
glad
and
surprised
to
find
this
i
like
looking
for
limited
or
seasonal
brews
would
buy
this
one
again
enjoyed
it
with
some
meatloaf
today
this
beer
could
stand
up
against
many
of
the
belgian
representations
of
this
style
its
extremely
drinkable
and
one
of
the
very
best
ive
had
from
brooklyn
drinkability
superb
this
beer
was
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
and
what
planned
to
be
a
brooklyn
and
one
other
bomber
evening
turned
into
a
two
brooklyn
bomberonly
session
ill
be
picking
more
of
this
up
love
this
beer
easy
to
drink
good
carbonation
among
the
best
domestic
saisons
available
here
right
next
to
hennepin
but
with
its
own
distinguished
character
music
terres
new
wuss
fusion
idol
tryouts
2
yet
another
excellent
showing
from
the
folks
at
brooklyn
brewing
overall
one
of
the
better
american
belgian
styles
i
thought
very
drinkable
very
potent
well
balanced
only
complaint
would
be
that
the
spices
could
be
toned
down
a
notch
very
impressive
in
hiding
the
9
abv
not
a
great
tasting
saison
but
unique
enough
to
grab
a
bottle
for
a
try
this
is
a
beer
that
really
defies
styles
part
german
lager
part
belgian
golden
and
a
big
part
saison
this
is
really
the
kind
of
beer
ive
been
waiting
on
from
brooklyn
daring
and
pushing
the
envelope
of
what
beer
can
be
could
use
a
little
bit
of
aging
to
bring
the
bitterness
down
but
other
that
nice
beer
drinkability
at
9
abv
i
wouldnt
normally
give
this
a
good
score
but
this
thing
is
just
so
damn
tasty
that
i
could
seriously
sip
it
all
night
this
beer
rocks
its
a
saison
all
the
way
its
closest
to
dupont
avec
however
it
doesnt
have
the
cognac
taste
it
is
beguiling
its
actually
a
changeling
the
flavor
goes
from
sweet
to
citric
id
prefer
you
to
drink
it
in
lieu
of
telling
you
about
it
somethings
are
better
left
unsaid
garrett
your
love
of
the
style
shines
through
thank
you
case
up
and
make
this
a
regular
offering
particularly
in
chicago
please
interesting
looking
25ozer
pours
clear
golden
with
a
white
head
that
does
leave
some
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
shows
some
sweetnessfruitiness
but
mostly
yeastiness
flavor
too
is
full
of
yeastiness
with
a
bit
of
spice
9
alcohol
is
clearly
there
limiting
drinkability
adding
to
an
already
somewhat
dryish
finish
somewhat
spritzy
carbonation
levels
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
not
really
much
like
other
saisons
ive
had
perhaps
more
like
the
strong
goldens
or
a
smaller
tripel
found
brooklyns
local
1
to
be
a
great
offering
it
was
very
refreshing
and
crisp
the
higher
alcohol
didnt
overpower
the
flavor
the
aroma
was
amazing
it
just
kept
pulling
me
back
for
one
more
sniff
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
brooklyns
next
big
bottle
beer
sure
it
took
a
lot
of
getting
used
to
and
the
alcohol
can
be
felt
here
but
this
is
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
at
a
comfortable
clip
theres
no
hop
bitterness
here
and
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
really
stands
out
since
this
is
solid
from
start
to
finish
its
hard
to
picture
this
as
a
saison
since
the
bottle
fermentation
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
a
more
belgiantype
style
than
that
no
matter
brooklyns
to
be
commended
for
going
out
on
a
limb
coming
up
with
another
milton
glaserpackaged
gem
and
for
brewing
in
the
borough
that
it
calls
home
heres
hoping
that
the
express
2
is
on
its
way
down
the
track
di
could
suck
this
down
if
it
was
cheaper
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
saison
and
i
think
it
is
mislabeled
on
this
site
this
is
almost
more
like
a
belgian
pale
or
a
light
tripel
this
one
is
hard
to
score
because
it
doesnt
fit
squarely
into
a
traditional
style
in
the
end
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
one
i
will
be
getting
again
overall
disappointed
with
the
smell
and
pour
i
was
ready
for
fireworks
it
tastes
more
like
a
wheat
than
a
typical
saison
i
know
this
one
was
brewed
and
bottled
differently
than
most
as
with
a
belgium
twist
but
overall
for
the
style
the
taste
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
hope
time
will
make
this
one
better
or
maybe
this
could
be
reclassified
closer
to
a
belgium
pale
reminds
me
of
orval
9
abv
will
prevent
you
from
drinking
too
much
of
this
beer
but
over
quite
a
few
hours
and
a
bunch
of
spicy
seafood
calamari
with
hot
sauce
and
shrimp
fra
diablo
in
my
case
you
can
put
down
a
fair
amount
of
this
fine
beer
i
like
to
call
belgium
in
brooklyn
drinkability

i
thought
this
was
off
from
the
style
but
not
a
bad
mix
of
ingredients
750
ml
bottle
bought
from
dag
in
park
slope
brooklyn
usually
these
corks
are
easier
to
get
out
oh
well
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
lovely
it
had
a
nice
fluffy
1
head
fruitycitrus
smell
then
flavor
mouthfeel
is
right
on
nice
and
quaffable
almost
chewy
fairly
drinkable
but
one
bottle
is
enough
very
good
over
all
i
was
very
excited
about
this
release
but
i
think
i
will
be
sticking
with
hennepin
in
the
future
actually
ill
probably
have
a
few
more
this
year
but
hennepin
is
about
half
the
price
for
similar
quality
pours
an
almost
clear
perfect
gold
color
with
a
sticky
bright
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
and
a
collar
very
intriguing
aroma
of
interesting
sweet
aromatics
left
over
from
the
sugar
i
assume
along
with
some
earthy
hop
notes
and
a
slightly
oxidized
after
some
time
warming
up
in
the
glass
pearish
smell
on
the
palate
huge
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
that
mauritian
sugar
followed
by
substantial
hop
bitterness
and
raw
alcohol
some
spiciness
comes
out
at
the
finish
tastes
like
a
yeast
byproduct
not
added
spices
which
is
quite
dry
and
long
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
with
some
hoppy
acidity
but
also
some
residual
sugar
making
for
a
medium
body
the
mouthfeel
is
what
places
this
somewhere
between
a
dry
saison
and
a
thicker
sweeter
belgian
golden
ale
overall
this
is
quite
an
interesting
brew
sitting
as
it
does
between
two
famous
and
important
styles
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
brew
ages
but
for
right
now
it
combines
some
of
the
better
characteristics
of
each
style
without
sacrificing
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
or
mouthfeel

best

its
a
good
beer
not
greatly
impressive
to
me

brooklyn

of

favorite
beer
sources
in
the
latest
offering
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
the
local

in
an
unusual
750ml
bottle
the
cursive
trademark
b
is
etched
subtly
into
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
absent
entirely
from
the
large
label
this
batch

method
in

boozy

and
a

but
well
done
currently

house
on

excellent
strong
pale

slightly

high

enormous
3
or
more
of
pure
white
finely
bubbled
foam

persists
and
leaves
ledges

offers
peaches
in

stages

ripeness
followed
by
an
earthy

bitterness
on
the
finish
with
a
layer
of
malt
sweetness
and
alcohol
it
is
slightly
warming
but
the
alcohol
is
not
hot
or
solventy
the
body
is
suprising
medium
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
and
flavor
and
the
carbonation
is
above
average
a
piece
of
art
it
brings
the
flavor
to
your
mouth
and
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
detect
its
large
abv
wonderfully
complex
and
balanced
sweetness
and
bitterness
combined
like
yin
and
yang
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
but
not
too
cheekpuffing
an
unbridled
yeasty
malty

this

an
awesome
a
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
and
i
must
say
that
piraat
compares
admirably
to
many
of
my
longtime
favourites
like
duvel
la
chouffe
and
don
de
dieu
this
is
a
sinfullytasty
strong
belgian
golden
ale
and
its
alcohol
content
is
so
masterfully
masked
that
id
be
likely
to
place
it
closer
to
78
than
1011
on
a
blind
test
a
great
way
to
cap
off
christmas
2014
and
any
fan
of
strong
belgian
pales
should
consider
this
an
absolute
musttry
teku

with

mainly
fruit
aromas
and
some
herbs
spices
coriander

the
big

aroma
and
also

the
taste
is

some

there
are

the
aftertaste

again
bready
the
warming

sensations
begins
somewhere
in
the
middle
till
very
end
the
body
is
smooth
thick
with
high
carbonation
and
smooth
finish
in
overall
interesting
belgian
beer
which
strikes
with
lots
of
aromas
and
flavours
alcohol
is
very
subdued
ingesting
beer
i
think
i
might
have
rated
this
slightly
higher
3
85
or
3
9
if
i
did
precise
and
based
on
previous
experiences
with
the
beer
this
particular
taste
i
rated
down
the
taste
because
it
didnt
sit
as
well
with
me
as
it
has
in
the
past
i
wavered
bt
3
5
and
3
75
will
continue
to
grab
this
occasionally
as
i
feel
i
do
still
enjoy
it
good
but
at
least
in
my
opinion
its
not
duvel
the
sheer
brute
force
and
stature
of
this
beer
may
make
it
a
tad
difficult
to
appreciate
some
of
the
finer
subtleties
present
these
flavors
will
fade
before
you
are
done
reeling
from
the
size
of
this
beer
overall
great
beer
well
balanced
and
goes
well
with
cheese
pizza
and
high
fatgreasy
fair
palate
cleansing
taste
like
my
triple
homebrew
love

for
me
a
great
honeymoon
ipa
feels
good
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
a
little
warm
from
the
alcohol
mmmmmm
good
stuff
from
belgium
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
not
top
of
the
line
but
it
isnt
very
far
off
love
that
it
packs
a
decent
punch
and
is
not
overly
sweet
amazing
hazy
golden
body
with
a
thick
lasting
white
head
smell
of
lemon
peel
a
little
herbal
hop
candy
sugar
and
yeast
fantastic
taste
that
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
prevent
any
sticky
cloying
sweetness
there
is
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
this
with
a
smooth
honey
and
candy
sugar
sweetness
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
of
all
time
i
rate
it
slightly
above
maredsous
one
of
those
if
i
was
stranded
on
a
desert
island
and
had
only
one
beer
kind
of
beers
overall
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
this
bottle
a
while
and
poured
darker
than
usual
but
the
flavor
profile
seemed
to
be
about
the
same
pours
a
brilliant
light
golden
with
a
lingering
frothy
ivory
head
aroma
is
floral
with
green
apple
sharpness
and
notes
of
perfumey
hops
flavor
reveals
more
sweetness
with
cherry
cough
drop
coming
to
mind
finish
is
alcoholic
the
phenols
are
overpowering
overall
a
bit
boozy
but
a
nice
beer
sippable
not
quaffable
advertised
as
bitter
but
its
not
at
all
bitter
imho
good
balanced
strong
ale
not
oversweet
nor
too
bitter
good
beer
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
surprisingly
hoppy
for
the
style
and
interesting
that
borders
other
styles
besides
strong
golden
ale
such
as
belgian
ipa
and
tripel
a
robust
tan
head
throws
a
thick
blanket
over
this
orange
brew
smells
of
mostly
light
fruits
pear
green
apple
peach
belgian
yeast
and
very
faint
hops
if
any
big
fruits
and
subtle
hops
mix
quickly
on
the
tongue
and
play
together
nicely
forming
a
pleasant
creamy
medium
body
alcohol
heat
flickers
across
the
back
of
the
throat
flavorful
and
consistent
all
the
way
through
pours
out
to
a
generous
buff
head
and
orangeamber
color
aroma
is
clove
fruit
spice
bubblegum
aged
hops
and
sugary
sweet
grains
flavor
is
complex
strong
on
alcohol
and
esters
and
finishes
boozy
yet
balanced
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
medium
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ale
i
dont
think
ipa
fits
here
food
match
tavern
wenches
but
seriously
this
bold
ale
would
have
to
be
paired
with
a
bold
meal
chargrilled
meats
bold
cheeses
large
cuban
cigars
and
gunpowder
yes
gunpowder
these
food
match
things
i
write
are
getting
rather
silly
now
arent
they
o
its
in
the
same
vein
as
duvel
and
im
guessing
the
hops
are
saaz
just
as
i
was
getting
bored
of
belgian
beer
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
amber
and
sits
in
the
glass
as
a
dark
orange
a
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
forms
above
the
beer
but
quickly
whittles
to
a
scrim
in
body
the
beer
is
dark
and
opaque
with
hints
of
cloudiness
swirling
before
the
eyes
when
washed
against
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
leaves
a
nice
set
of
legs
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
musty
grains
honey
fusel
alcohol
and
cidery
fruit
notes
hints
of
herbal
and
minty
hops
work
their
way
into
the
scent
as
the
glass
is
agitated
as
well
as
subtle
sherry
the
smell
is
not
particularly
strong
for
a
10
5
abv
beer
but
is
instead
richly
subtle
and
restrained
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
smoothly
sweet
with
a
warming
grainy
alcohol
heat
that
builds
to
just
before
the
finish
the
finish
splashes
slight
herbal
hops
and
just
a
whisper
of
acidity
and
salinity
rounding
the
beer
into
a
subtly
complex
giant
in
flavor
the
beer
tastes
of
sweet
cereal
grains
which
move
into
rich
silky
clover
honey
before
introducing
sweet
grainy
alcohol
the
alcoholic
heat
builds
into
the
finish
of
the
beer
briefly
skirting
on
cloying
and
then
on
to
fusel
notes
before
it
mellows
into
a
minerallysweet
finish
that
blends
the
honey
malts
with
herbal
minty
hops
booze
very
faint
lemongrass
and
a
touch
of
salty
bread
the
aftertaste
is
of
lingering
honey
and
herbal
bitter
hops
that
linger
in
the
mouth
for
quite
some
time
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
crisp
sharp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
and
silky
carbonation
the
mouth
is
left
tingling
from
the
alcoholic
heat
when
the
beer
leaves
but
is
then
doused
in
a
torrent
of
spittle
that
pours
from
the
sides
of
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
beautifully
restrained
belgian
strong
golden
ale
the
yeast
character
is
soft
though
subtle
phenols
and
esters
do
start
to
sprout
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
beautiful
sipper
and
a
wonderful
example
of
how
to
brew
with
a
restrained
hand
quite
the
opposite
of
most
american
brewers
these
days
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
flavors
i
unravel
which
is
excellent
o
suppose
ill
have
to
try
this
again
poured
more
carefully
wont
go
out
of
my
way
though
its
ok
just
artfully
refined
and
somewhat
boring
a
vehicle
for
booze
a
nice
looking
first
pour
and
good
lacing
make
this
an
attractive
beer
it
has
good
mouthfeel
the
only
detraction
is
the
heavy
appearance
of
alcohol
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
a
shame
otherwise
this
beer
would
be
excellent

pours
a
pretty
cloudy
darkorange
in
color
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
heat
that
stays
around
for
a
long
time
there
is
a
bunch
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
the
pour
lots
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
as
well
there
is
a
bunch
going
on
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
caramel
malts
lemon
grass
dark
fruits
and
honey
the
taste
has
a
lot
going
on
as
well
with
sweet
malts
right
up
front
followed
by
plums
and
some
sweet
bourbonlike
flavor
for
the
finish
i
am
surprised
it
is
a
i
p
a
style
brew
as
there
is
no
bitterhoppy
aftertaste
at
all
you
dont
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
either
goes
down
easy
and
after
one
of
these
on
a
empty
stomach
you
will
feel
it
over
a
great
brew
o
good
drinkablility
despite
of
the
abv
pleasant
and
well
done
belgian
strong
ale
classic
o
piraat
ale
is
a
classic
for
me
one
of
the
first
true
belgian
ales
that
got
me
hooked
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
and
belgium
in
general
a
true
genius
recipe
that
still
plays
a
major
role
in
my
craft
beer
life
its
always
there
and
will
never
let
you
down
this
is
something
people
will
be
drinking
til
the
end
of
time
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
whether
on
draft
or
in
bottle
this
beer
never
fails
to
impress
not
a
great
aroma
but
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
with
hints
of
spiciness
and
moderate
floral
notes
while
a
huge
belgian
fan
this
style
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorites
im
not
sure
why
but
piraat
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
in
this
style
with
easy
drinkability
very
moderate
hops
and
an
almost
undetectable
alcohol
presence
for
its
high
abv
and
i
love
the
bottle
ill
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
this
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
tasty
belgian
strong
its
a
classic
for
a
reason
as
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
belgian
strong
with
just
enough
hop
to
keep
it
lively
o
a
good
obtainable
belgian
style
ipa
perhaps
not
the
best
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
o
a
surprisingly
good
belgian
ipa
nice
crisp
flavors
and
fruitiness
tastes
really
light
and
refreshing
until
i
realized
this
was
10
5
it
goes
down
like
a
6
belgian
pale
great
balance
and
drinkability
is
off
the
chart
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
ever
had
the
taste
is
very
good
lots
of
yeast
providing
a
sort
of
fruity
tangy
element
which
leads
to
a
more
hop
driven
spice
and
herbal
mix
the
taste
of
candy
sugar
is
there
but
it
is
not
obtrusive
more
complimentary
to
the
yeast
and
supplements
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
a
tasty
way
there
is
a
good
amount
alcohol
to
bolster
the
hops
in
the
flavor
more
of
a
strong
pale
than
belgian
ipa
to
my
taste
but
who
knows
what
this
is
like
fresh
in
belgiumnot
me
i
like
this
but
it
seems
stronger
than
most
of
its
strength
i
like
the
taste
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
considering
its
complexity
o
a
little
more
alcohol
flavor
than
i
prefer
i
think
it
takes
away
from
some
of
the
other
great
aspects
of
this
one
bottle
from
the
lazy
dog
pours
a
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
subside
in
fact
this
bottle
tried
to
pour
itself
aromas
of
honey
and
pilsner
malt
with
hints
of
sweet
fruit
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
clove
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
honey
like
malty
sweetness
with
a
solid
shot
of
warming
alcohol
bits
of
light
sweet
fruit
like
apple
pear
and
raisin
offset
with
a
spicy
earthy
yeasty
flavor
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
but
a
thick
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
nice
sipping
beer
flavorful
and
tasty
im
glad
i
threw
this
one
in
the
mixed
six
the
other
day
this
beer
is
perfect
three
finger
head
a
light
honey
brown
color
along
with
solid
carbonation
providing
a
enjoyable
mouthfeel
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
like
to
relax
with
one
brew
or
two
if
that
beer
happens
to
be
a
piraat
then
im
a
happy
camper
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
it
is
something
i
would
enjoy
more
in
the
spring
or
summer
but
that
is
just
my
preference
i
have
to
say
that
the
high
abv
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
perhaps
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
great
belgian
strong
here
but
a
shade
below
the
hype
its
blonder
than
expected
with
a
robust
inch
of
thick
white
foam
lemon
lime
color
simple
but
elegant
the
nose
is
bitter
indeed
but
not
fully
from
hops
some
funny
malting
strategy
here
perhaps
is
to
blame
or
maybe
it
is
hops
hard
to
tell
from
smell
alone
i
dont
get
the
other
hop
essentials
so
im
confused
rich
flavor
creamy
feel
vanilla
before
the
bitter
taste
comes
in
rich
grain
bill
oats
maybe
here
like
a
tripel
but
not
sweet
at
all
minus
the
candy
sugar
interesting
but
the
alcohol
is
strong
its
almost
too
strong
the
taste
finishes
with
a
burn
and
its
moderately
unflattering
but
still
unique
to
this
brew
alone
with
all
that
strange
bitter
well
carbonated
and
smooth
aside
from
the
booze
burn
less
drinkable
than
many
but
a
complex
and
well
refined
glass
of
ale
ill
be
back
pours
light
orange
gold
with
thick
white
creamy
head
smells
of
pears
honey
light
alcohol
and
some
citrus
fruit
taste
is
divine
very
fruity
pears
citrus
sweet
sugars
with
light
belgian
spice
sweet
and
hides
the
booze
well
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
slick
but
goes
down
easy
not
sure
how
to
characterize
this
one
but
it
is
fantastic
i
would
love
to
drink
this
all
the
time
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
in
fact
that
before
i
left
for
the
evening
i
grabbed
a
growler
and
shared
it
with
my
colleagues
the
following
evening
at
a
dinner
event
all
but
one
person
found
the
beer
to
be
exceptional
the
naysayer
is
admittedly
only
fond
of
coors
light
and
michelob
golden
draft
light
so
i
wasnt
surprised
in
the
least
that
he
would
poopoo
this
dilectable
beverage
to
each
their
own
though
i
personally
dont
enjoy
lima
beans
there
i
said
it
left
wanting
somehow
overall
while
i
really
enjoyed
my
beer
third
best
of
the
six
pack
i
found
it
a
touch
overly
refined
and
less
extreme
than
i
hoped
for
would
never
turn
one
down
as
this
remains
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
overall
this
is
a
fine
presentation
from
van
steenberge
i
acquired
this
beer
in
a
van
steenberge
mix
6
pack
that
i
carry
at
my
shop
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
complex
profile
similar
to
gulden
draak
triple
however
this
beer
is
a
great
belgian
ale
that
delivers
and
will
definetly
be
carried
now
as
its
own
item
in
my
shop
it
is
very
drinkable
on
any
occasion
not
too
complex
but
absolutely
not
bland
either
overall
im
glad
to
have
sampled
this
beer
but
its
not
one
im
likely
to
get
again
in
many
ways
it
reminds
me
of
green
flashs
le
freak
but
its
a
bit
more
unbalanced
than
that
version
even
though
both
are
quite
strong
piraat
ah
yeah
to
be
fair
this
was
strong
and
not
something
that
could
be
quickly
downed
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
taste
however
as
this
was
great
from
start
to
finish
and
had
enough
to
like
in
it
like
so
many
other
belgian
beers
even
with
the
hint
of
lemon
in
the
mouthfeel
this
was
very
aggressive
and
spices
are
minor
enough
not
to
detract
from
that
a
great
beer
that
deserves
to
be
savored
slowly
for
all
that
its
worth
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
has
a
duvel
but
also
la
chouffe
character
along
with
tripel
characteristics
a
truly
underrated
belgian
beer
o
a
really
good
belgian
high
in
alcohol
reminiscent
of
unibroue
a
nice
sipper
with
some
strangeness
that
would
make
me
prefer
others
over
it
i
am
sad
to
have
to
have
finished
halfway
through
this
without
going
on
any
further
as
i
remember
i
used
to
love
this
one
a
lot
i
hold
the
belief
that
this
brewery
makes
great
offerings
gulden
draak
but
im
going
to
start
opening
all
these
remaining
bottles
from
the
gift
pack
that
i
negligently
stored
away
however
i
feel
that
overall
this
isnt
much
better
fresh
it
simply
lacks
the
subtlety
of
dried
hops
i
enjoy
in
the
style
and
seems
to
be
way
too
overboozed
for
its
own
good
o
great
ale
alcohol
is
hidden
more
so
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
i
enjoyed
it
great
pour
three
finger
head
that
sustains
good
lacing
dark
amber
color
smells
great
i
love
the
bottle
cap
artwork
very
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
outstanding
does
not
taste
like
a
10
5
beer
it
goes
down
very
smooth
followed
by
a
malty
and
thin
but
strong
aftertaste
a
great
after
dinner
beer
outstanding
o
wonderful
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
i
had
this
listed
as
a
4
55
in
my
tasting
book
but
now
getting
to
review
this
may
go
higher
the
burning
alcohol
in
the
throat
lasts
a
while
i
dont
know
if
that
helps
or
hurts
this
beer
overall
very
solid
beer
the
style
may
not
be
my
favorite
among
belgians
but
piraat
seems
to
represent
it
well
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
one
of
the
best
more
please
oi
love
belgians
but
i
had
never
tried
piraat
until
now
i
am
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
not
for
the
timid
it
shows
all
of
the
10
5
abv
in
both
smell
and
taste
but
it
certainly
is
fun
the
hoppy
bitterness
like
many
of
piraats
belgian
counterparts
is
not
inyourface
but
it
creeps
in
towards
the
finish
and
provides
just
a
bit
of
balance
for
the
pale
malty
sweetness
that
mostly
dominates
brash
and
enjoyable
overall
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
the
abv
was
very
well
hidden
but
apart
from
that
this
just
tasted
like
a
standard
belgian
style
pale
ale
this
is
excellent
i
had
a
difficult
time
ascertaining
the
smell
and
taste
particulars
but
had
no
trouble
at
all
enjoying
this
brew
the
pepper
and
alcoholic
content
were
the
most
noticeable
to
me
i
really
thought
it
was
beautiful
to
look
at
and
the
taste
was
very
unique
i
will
get
this
again
pair
this
beer
with
aged
sharp
cheddar
black
grapes
and
peppered
triscuits
this
beer
is
also
fantastic
with
an
everything
or
meat
pizza
superb
goes
down
a
treat
looks
great
and
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
wonderfully
smooth
and
mellow
plenty
of
booze
yet
it
complements
the
character
perfectly
the
body
envelops
the
palate
not
sure
how
it
got
listed
as
an
ipa
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
hops
a
fantastic
strong
belgian
ale
i
really
shouldnt
have
put
this
off
for
so
long
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
good
belgian
ipa
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again

d
a

indeed
excellent
example
of

well
crafted
with
good
complexity
and
yet
extremely
drinkable
abv
is
tremendously
well
hidden
nigh
unbelievable
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
o
an
interesting
belgian
ale
for
sure
i
think
the
balance
here
is
impeccable
and
theres
a
great
layering
of
flavors
cheers
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
the
high
abv
is
not
noticible
in
the
taste
but
its
definitely
there
it
sneaks
up
on
you
this
is
a
super
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
taste
is
quite
good
with
a
dry
spiciness
pale
and
pil
malts
its
bitter
alittle
sweet
and
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
while
drinking
it
anyway
overall
just
an
amazing
and
delicious
belgian
ipa
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
the
american
ipas
that
i
love
but
an
excellent
example
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
oreally
great
belgian
ale
writing
this
review
with
a
bit
of
a
cold
so
ill
come
back
and
edit
when
i
can
appreciate
it
more
fully
overall
a
good
beer
certainly
and
quality
throughout
that
said
i
just
dont
think
most
true
belgian
brews
are
my
thing
ive
had
more
than
my
fair
share
and
most
of
them
dont
hit
that
ahh
i
gotta
have
that
again
feeling
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
if
this
is
someones
favorite
beer
i
can
understand
why
theres
just
too
much
sugar
character
for
me
i
think
ill
steer
clear
of
belgians
for
awhile
o
excellent
belgian
brew
complex
aroma
and
flavors
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
the
nose
picked
up
an
array
of
lovely
desserts
made
in
grandmas
kitchen
with
the
main
but
secret
ingredient
being
a
bitter
molasses
that
would
define
this
brew
i
had
to
go
for
round
two
and
then
round
three
in
the
bottle
each
time
the
carbonation
pairing
well
with
the
malt
for
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
the
color
is
something
or
other
of
a
high
heat
fire
burning
the
wet
driftwood
on
a
beach
outside
of
portobello
while
on
a
search
for
the
rest
of
captain
morgans
loot
that
the
history
books
never
got
around
to
mentioning
and
for
good
reason
the
head
and
lace
of
a
cloudy
white
like
a
fire
that
has
to
churn
the
water
to
vapors
to
provide
a
dense
white
smoke
that
lingers
in
the
glass
while
settling
and
becoming
twice
as
dense
aside
from
the
mass
production
of
this
said
product
we
have
a
brew
that
would
appease
even
the
most
eccentric
of
the
privateers
out
there
way
too
much
carbonation

which
got
more
pronounced
as
the

warmed
tasted
apples
bananas
yeast
and
molasses
as
expected
it
was
quite
bitter
generally
the
booze
was
well
hidden
well
carbonated
which
gave
it
a
slightly
coarse
edge
slightly
thick
body
liked
it
but
dont
think
it
did
quite
enough
to
justify
some
of
the
hype

the

and
a
slightly
herbal
quality
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
toasted
malt
character
theres
also
a
trace
of
bitterness
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
acidic
astringency
im
not
sure
id
classify
this
as
a
belgian
ipa
as
its
closer
to
a
bspa
in
my
opinion
that
said
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
complex
with
an
extremely
wellhidden
abv
im
sorry
i
put
off
trying
this
it
for
so
long
great
brew
want
more
i
think
that
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
not
my
thing
overall
complex
and
interesting
really
worth
sipping
slowly
and
identifying
different
flavors
and
aromas
the
alcohol
is
invisible
until
the
very
end
mouthfeel
lets
it
down
a
bit
but
its
still
a
top
belgian
pale
in
my
books
o
im
not
getting
ipa
out
of
this
one
more
like
a
tripel
to
me
with
a
10
5
abv
this
is
a
sipper
so
take
your
time
and
enjoy
gets
even
better
with
time
as
it
warms
up
grab
this
one
if
you
see
it
overall
a
spicy
and
well
balanced
beer
leans
more
on
the
spice
than
on
the
yeast
making
it
more
reminiscent
of
a
spicy
duvel
than
like
yeasty
la
fin
du
monde
o
as
i
was
saying
i
can
see
how
some
people
might
think
that
this
beer
isnt
phenomenal
i
really
can
the
nose
is
funky
and
odd
and
entirely
wonderful
with
its
beautiful
clashing
of
malt
and
hops
and
some
fruit
that
turns
into
this
sort
of
almost
overwhelming
symphony
of
smells
but
the
clashing
nature
of
them
somehow
just
really
works
out
it
isnt
too
much
it
is
delicious
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
its
all
spot
on
this
is
a
great
and
in
my
opinion
a
somewhat
underrated
beer
you
just
gotta
love
it
the
right
way
o
a
bold
belgian
with
loads
of
flavour
and
an
incredibly
well
hidden
abv
this
stuff
is
very
sweet
but
still
easily
sessioned
a
great
selection
an
well
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
a
good
brew
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
the
more
i
tasted
it
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
mosttimes
triples
and
quads
are
too
belgian
esteryfruityeasty
for
my
tastes
and
i
often
avoid
ordering
the
style
this
appeals
enough
to
my
love
for
american
dipas
to
say
that
ill
seek
this
out
again
good
stuff
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
how
to
make
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
different
tastes
but
none
of
them
really
sticking
out
and
smothering
the
other
tastes
with
the
beer
overall
excellent
beer
to
be
included
with
a
session
of
belgian
pale
ales
or
tripels
or
quite
honestly
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
pours
a
dark
amber
honey
with
slight
murkiness
almost
10w30ish
with
zero
head
slight
foaming
ala
an
espersso
corona
smell
is
undetectable
to
very
slightly
sweet
taste
is
remarkable
i
am
a
fan
of
bsdas
and
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
think
this
is
a
bsda
although
this
is
classified
as
a
bipa
fruity
notes
not
overpowering
10
5
alcohol
not
apparent
no
booziness
that
i
could
detect
mouthfeel
very
pleasant
consisting
of
a
mild
carbonation
overall
a
fine
offering
from
a
6
pack
sampler
of
330
ml
bottles
much
nicer
than
i
expected
o
much
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
this
one
my
palette
was
in
its
youthful
stages
that
said
i
can
list
a
number
of
belgians
that
are
flat
out
better
than
this
one
great
flavors
going
on
here
mostly
the
tropical
fruits
whereas
most
belgians
darks
have
such
a
deeper
darker
take
m
nice
mediumfullbodied
beer
with
high
carbonation
that
keeps
it
crisp
and
drinkable
despite
the
strength
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
honey
and
citrus
zest
there
is
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
pretty
damn
strong
o
superb
belgian
style
ipa
i
had
this
a
year
ago
with
questionable
freshness
and
i
didnt
like
it
but
i
am
very
impressed
with
it
now
amazing
how
much
your
palate
can
adapt
in
a
year
certainly
worth
checking
out
by
any
ipa
or
belgian
beer
fan
watch
out
for
freshness
however
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
profile
in
this
beer
one
of
my
favourites
not
top
10
but
very
close
this
amber
coloured
strong
blond
ale
can
be
enjoyed
with
our
without
adding
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
personally
i
prefer
to
add
it
gives
the
beer
that
extra
punch
complex
rich
taste
starting
with
an
in
your
face
hoppy
biterness
followed
by
a
caramellike
sweetness
with
a
peppery
finish
which
is
washed
away
by
light
sweetness
again
kicking
in
a
bit
stronger
then
first
it
has
a
little
sticky
mouthfeel
afterwards
so
it
will
not
be
your
preffered
thirstquenching
drink
but
still
very
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
evening
outside
o
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
tried
to
date
bar
none
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
nice
head
as
expected
for
the
style
and
the
wildly
complex
aroma
the
smell
here
really
does
trump
the
taste
with
beautiful
spicy
inclusions
that
translated
into
more
puckering
sourness
in
the
taste
rather
than
enhancing
and
deepening
the
grain
nice
and
complex
and
tasty
for
the
style
despite
all
that
the
flavors
are
still
solid
and
there
is
still
a
good
hop
presence
the
front
end
is
sweet
from
the
candi
sugar
and
malts
bready
from
the
malt
and
yeast
and
that
hop
bitterness
follows
as
well
the
booze
also
comes
through
in
the
flavor
there
is
some
faint
fruitiness
as
well
but
it
is
mild
and
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
other
flavors
the
body
is
medium
with
abundant
carbonation
the
higher
alcohol
can
definitely
be
felt
here
but
it
should
at
10
5
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
i
dont
know
why
i
expected
more
from
this
bipa
i
keep
reviewing
this
style
that
i
clearly
dont
enjoy
the
only
exceptions
being
belgian
monk
and
i
did
like
tramp
stamp
this
one
could
tone
down
the
booze
a
bit
and
probably
receive
a
better
rating
from
me
o
a
very
grapey
sweet
bipa
could
use
more
balancing
bitterness
oi
love
this
style
and
this
is
an
awesome
example
the
hops
really
balance
this
out
hopefully
we
get
some
more
midwest
examples
of
this
style
o
tons
of
flavor
nice
hop
balance
great
beer
belgo
ipa
10
5
is
completely
hidden
except
for
a
slight
warming
the
first
thing
i
noticed
after
looking
at
the
ba
site
is
that
this
is
referred
to
as
a
belgian
ipa
on
the
bottle
it
says
belgian
ale
is
this
a
mistake
on
bas
part
or
is
this
qualified
as
a
real
ipa
i
have
come
to
expect
ipas
to
be
very
hoppy
i
prefer
maltier
recipesand
this
is
not
coming
close
to
being
hoppy
at
10
5
abv
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
came
in
a
sample
pack
from
the
local
total
wine
store
and
all
have
been
excellent
m
nicely
carbonated
slight
bite
from
alcohol
very
warming
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
there
was
a
sudsy
white
head
that
soon
dissipated
to
clots
leaving
brussels
lace
the
beer
looks
like
a
heavy
apple
juice
piraat
smells
like
a
yeasty
banana
pear
and
apricot
concoction
in
the
taste
there
is
also
a
light
citrus
peellike
quality
there
is
a
smart
tingle
in
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
complex
fruity
flavor
and
true
to
a
good
belgian
a
perfect
hop
balance
forget
the
grog
piraat
will
chase
away
the
scurvy
overall
this
was
a
tasty
and
decently
complex
belgian
ipa
by
no
means
the
hoppy
belgianstyle
ipas
we
have
here
in
america
but
a
more
traditional
take
on
the
style
i
feel
the
abv
was
a
touch
high
and
started
to
detract
from
the
overall
flavor
profile
but
the
alcohol
was
very
clean
and
was
in
no
way
offensive
recommended
to
any
fan
of
belgians
or
a
fan
of
ipas
looking
to
try
something
different
cheers
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
tasty
and
flavorful
though
nothing
transcendent
will
buy
again
next
time
though
will
pick
up
a
bottle
to
take
my
time
with
at
home
where
i
can
give
it
my
full
attention
no
freshness
date
tastes
like
their
could
be
age
since
the
hops
play
a
very
small
role
either
way
thisll
age
with
the
best
of
them
cool

and

wheaty

mix

notes
perhaps
the
most
refreshing
10
abv
beer
ive
had
very
good
stuff
the
only
draw
back
to
this
beer
is
the
price
i
cant
find
a
4
pack
for
under
18
dollars
nor
can
i
find
a
750
ml
bottle
for
under
13
dollars
overall
i
wont
be
trying
this
beer
again
its
a
little
too
hardcore
for
me
aha
o
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
ever
had
easy
to
drink
and
great
taste
even
at
its
high
abv
o
i
really
love
this
beer
and
it
might
be
my
favorite
readily
available
golden
ale
from
belgium
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
deep
yelloworange
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
spice
and
spicy
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
fruit
hop
spice
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
the
fruit
presence
on
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
the
dominant
factor
going
on
here
and
covered
up
what
could
have
been
quite
a
few
subtle
notes
that
got
lost
i
really
hope
this
was
not
the
case
as
this
one
had
the
potential
to
be
a
really
nicely
done
brew
for
the
style
but
just
lacked
the
complexity
i
love
from
some
of
the
brews
of
this
style
glad
this
one
is
easy
to
find
as
i
might
keep
a
few
in
my
fridge
for
future
tastingsguests
to
enjoy
update
i
dont
like
belgian
ipa
this
is
a
fine
powerful
and
intense
brew
hard
to
think
of
anything
better
for
its
style
o
a
classic
never
question
the
integrity
of
the
classic
belgian
beers
a
strong
fresh
bright
and
yet
deep
beer
stronger
than
it
drinks
dont
kid
yourself
this
is
a
high
abv
drink
10
5
but
it
is
extremely
delicious
it
might
not
sound
like
much
but
this
is
a
top
25
beer
for
me
remember
theres
a
lot
of
beers
so
top
25
is
a
pretty
exclusive
club
a
true
go
to
beer
like
a
duvel
or
an
old
rasputin
a
magnificent
beer
rjt
o
i
dont
remember
having
this
beer
before
its
really
not
quite
what
i
expected
thought
there
would
be
more
hopbitter
character
than
im
finding
the
dry
finish
is
interesting
given
the
sweetfruity
aroma
initial
taste
still
its
a
good
beer
and
one
thats
growing
on
me
as
i
drink
it
as
a
side
note
given
the
over
10
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
although
you
do
taste
it
i
cant
believe
i
havent
rated
this
yet
after
drinking
it
for
the
last
15
yrs
pours
a
hazy
amber
topped
with
a
foamy
white
head
great
lace
and
retention
faint
malty
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
some
grass
and
hints
of
pepper
spice
huge
malt
profile
of
sweet
malts
with
a
massive
honeylike
character
and
notes
of
tropical
fruits
alcohol
warms
the
palate
and
a
sting
of
spice
then
gives
way
to
a
smooth
grassy
bitterness
and
big
dose
of
the
pepper
the
dry
and
bitter
charactered
finish
brings
spice
citrus
and
alcohol
along
which
leaves
a
tartspicyfruity
aftertaste
behind
every
síp
brings
a
new
impression
its
well
balanced
and
drinkable
poured
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
sported
a
great
golden
color
in
the
body
and
a
healthy
layer
of
sudsy
froth
up
top
the
bite
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
the
abv
while
high
is
so
well
hidden
that
i
would
call
this
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
this
range
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
in
about
five
years
last
night
and
i
remember
it
being
my
favorite
beer
at
the
time
while
i
knew
my
fond
memory
of
having
it
the
first
time
would
overshadow
the
second
time
around
that
said
a
wonderful
belgian
creation
well
worth
the
1520
for
a
four
pack
warms
in
the
body
high
alcohol
beer
that
is
well
hidden
a
bomb
very
good
beer
enormous
fluffy
head
eventually
collapses
into
itself
somewhat
but
just
wont
quit
lingering
on
at
no
less
than
one
finger
unreal
lacing
beautiful
burnished
gold
shade
looks
perfectly
inviting
especially
when
held
right
up
by
a
light
source
just
a
touch
of
haze
but
not
so
much
that
it
obscures
the
perpetual
effervescence
at
the
heart
of
the
beer
simply
gorgeous
the
smells
are
spicy
and
yeasty
pretty
prominent
clove
aroma
maybe
some
nutmeg
alcohol
is
fairly
obvious
a
human
being
will
smell
boozy
after
consuming
this
and
even
a
tiny
person
is
considerably
larger
than
a
11
2
oz
bottle
flavors
come
on
sweet
and
spicy
at
first
a
lot
of
intensely
caramel
sweet
and
somewhat
acidic
fruity
flavors
the
hops
basically
ambush
the
scene
after
hiding
out
on
the
aroma
front
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
either
but
their
bitterness
comes
on
strong
right
along
with
the
boozy
warming
sensation
to
create
a
memorable
beer
experience
the
hops
are
enough
to
dry
your
mouth
out
but
the
beer
itself
could
finish
a
bit
drier
this
is
a
big
pushy
beer
and
the
carbonation
level
also
fits
those
descriptors
and
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
as
it
serves
to
lively
up
a
beer
that
would
feel
much
stickier
otherwise
all
together
i
personally
really
enjoyed
this
beer
after
having
one
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
i
feel
like
this
one
sometimes
gets
disrespected
or
overlooked
by
some
for
being
widely
available
or
being
part
of
a
somewhat
larger
conglomerate
or
whatever
but
if
an
american
brewery
produced
something
like
this
people
would
be
falling
all
over
themselves
if
distribution
was
limited
and
they
used
the
word
barrel
and
goodtasting

it
wasnt

as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
all
the
other
complex
flavors
and

seemed
to

you

54opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
has
a
solid
flavor
and
i
will
have
to
read
up
on
it
a
bit
more
now
as
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
there
are
some
american
c
hops
in
here
overall
i
like
the
dryness
that
you
get
from
the
tripels
over
this
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
drinking
this
4pack
o
overall
id
say
its
an
alright
tripel
or
bspa
but
definitely
not
a
belgian
ipa
perhaps
i
need
a
fresher
bottle
but
the
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
as
is
even
if
the
hops
had
shown
up
the
beer
is
too
sticky
sweet
for
me
to
give
it
a
high
score
o
decent
beer
but
not
hoppy
enough
for
the
style
thought
there
was
too
much
yeasty
esters
and
the
alcohol
could
have
come
through
a
bit
less
d
higher
abv
makes
more
than
two
a
tough
time
but
the
taste
says
otherwise
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
as
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
have
with
a
meal
a
snack
or
just
on
its
own
d
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
would
drink
several
if
not
for
the
10
5
abv
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
very
good
none
the
less
aaargh
matey
all
these
factors
led
to
a
pretty
high
drinkability
factor
ill
be
buying
a
6er
of
this
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
sure
d
trying
to
get
a
good
read
on
this
and
im
struggling
i
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
i
am
not
very
impressed
with
this
belgian
from
the
330
ml
bottle
marked
02fj1418
sampled
on
march
3
2011
it
pours
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
and
hypnotic
upward
trickling
carbonation
malts
hops
dough
and
a
hard
to
define
fruit
are
all
meshed
into
the
aroma
the
body
is
medium
to
full
the
10
5
abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
it
leaves
a
memorable
impression
in
my
head
the
finish
is
almost
dry
but
not
quite
this
has
become
a
favorite
over
the
last
year
or
so
theres
no
dating
on
the
bottles
pours
nicely
with
a
hazed
yelloworange
and
puts
up
a
fluffy
2finger
head
that
holds
on
for
half
a
glass
till
it
becomes
a
foamy
filmring
leaving
behind
spotty
rings
of
lacing
smells
of
the
belgian
yeast
clove
along
with
some
tropical
fruit
and
herbal
action
i
guess
im
picking
up
the
bananas
in
the
beer
taste
along
with
a
spicy
zing
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
peppery
action
as
well
and
a
sweet
creamy
finish
where
all
the
before
mentioned
flavors
come
together
very
nicely
each
sip
is
very
flavorful
and
begs
for
the
next
good
carbonation
the
first
glass
has
me
warm
behind
the
ears
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
is
just
right
for
me
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
mediumlarge
white
head
that
slowly
goes
down
scent
is
floral
hoppy
yeasy
and
fruity
some
scents
of
green
apples
and
bananas
i
also
get
some
pear
aromas
with
some
spiciness
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
me
this
tastes
more
like
a
triple
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
than
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
there
are
some
tasty
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
great
spices
and
clove
banana
green
apples
and
pear
are
definitely
there
this
beer
finishes
with
some
warm
booziness
and
slight
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
very
dry
i
like
it
drinkability
is
fairly
high
it
sure
is
tasty
but
the
booziness
could
probably
become
overwhelming
after
a
couple
of
these
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
about
a
finger
of
rich
white
head
standing
firm
delicious
aroma
of
rumlike
spice
hops
and
hints
of
fruits
envelop
the
nose
every
drink
fills
the
mouth
with
some
carbonation
and
bitterness
but
then
turns
creamy
all
the
way
through
the
swallow
ending
with
a
warming
peppery
finish
surprisingly
light
for
the
10
5
abv
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
belgian
strong
ale
i
found
it
quite
enjoyablea
great
original
brew
from
brouwerij
van
steenberge
when
drinking
this
imagine
that
you
are
a
pirate
youd
want
something
light
but
fullbodied
and
have
some
kick
in
it
too
this
beer
certainly
does
that
d
yes
sir
d
i
was
almost
done
with
my
glass
before
i
realized
that
the
bottle
was
practically
gone
flavorful
and
refreshing
this
is
definitely
a
beer
where
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
not
thats
its
not
evident
in
the
taste
just
incredibly
easy
to
drink
quickly
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
fresh
drinkability
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
good
i
dont
know
if
ill
look
for
more
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
on
the
stronger
side
for
the
style
but
this
doesnt
hinder
drinkability
too
much
piraat
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
ive
had
several
of
the
750mls
over
the
last
23
years
and
i
think
they
represent
better
than
the
small
bottles
i
have
no
problem
at
all
giving
it
high
marks
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
have
again
drinkability
is
just
good
i
would
have
this
over
a
few
other
belgians
but
i
know
ive
had
better
could
drink
again
no
problem
but
the
high
abv
is
real
noticeable
and
does
not
make
for
easy
drinkability
o
pretty
gangster
in
the
totem
of
belgian
ipas
this
isnt
really
on
top
hopit
and
the
houblon
have
it
crushed
imo
it
still
is
wonderful
though
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
head
very
good
smelling
beer
not
a
real
memorable
flavor
on
the
nose
though
good
tasting
with
a
bitter
finish
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
but
nothing
like
a
malt
liquor
or
anything
good
feel
i
dont
think
id
drink
a
ton
of
these
beers
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
in
an
evening
i
havent
had
this
one
in
awhile
and
this
particular
bottle
was
so
good
it
reminds
me
of
a
tap
beer
i
dont
get
it
but
its
really
working
well
right
now
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
in
my
tulip
glass
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
introduce
to
wine
drinking
friends
its
a
strong
complex
and
tasteful
beer
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
for
its
size
very
enjoyable
beer
definitely
more
on
the
sweeter
side
not
as
bitter
as
id
like
but
the
flavors
are
spot
on
and
i
love
the
body
of
piraat
its
worth
trying
dont
know
why
belgians
think
this
style
is
hoppy
its
way
to
sweet
for
that
maybe
im
just
an
american
but
this
ones
damn
good
gimme
more
d
quite
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favourites
i
have
had
other
belgian
ipas
that
i
found
better
but
this
one
is
still
recommended
for
devotees
of
the
style
i
probably
wont
be
getting
another
one
d
hides
the
10
5
well
thoroughly
drinkable
albeit
not
as
distinct
as
id
like
a
really
solid
brew
i
just
wish
the
alcohol
were
a
little
more
balanced
drinkability
is
good
this
one
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
almost
any
time
youve
got
a
free
hand
and
could
use
a
beer
in
it
an
easy
to
drink
strong
ale
lovely
on
tap
at
iron
horse
in
dc
but
usually
pours
out
from
bottle
to
a
dimple
glass
or
snifter
glass
pours
rich
golden
yellow
and
cheddary
with
a
nice
head
and
beautiful
lattice
work
aroma
is
a
hint
of
sweet
sage
followed
by
bread
and
citrus
flavor
is
a
sweet
grapefruit
a
touch
of
bubblegum
and
perhaps
bread
palate
is
thick
and
chewy
great
belgian
that
i
order
often
at
bars
when
available
wow
whopping
head
i
was
fast
enough
to
not
let
any
get
away
lace
is
plentiful
and
was
not
going
anywhere
color
is
a
8
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
a
cornucopia
of
berries
and
fruits
and
malt
taste
is
so
complex
each
sip
brings
something
new
cranberries
blueberry
raspberry
apple
orange
honey
spices
this
is
a
kick
your
butt
ipa
you
are
focusing
on
the
flavor
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
10
5
abv
hits
you
another
wow
lots
of
body
and
creaminess
in
the
mouth
a
little
too
sweet
and
complex
to
drink
several
in
succession
but
one
good
beer
drinkbilty
at
10
5
its
not
something
you
can
drink
34
beers
of
im
a
sucker
for
strong
beers
and
this
did
the
trick
really
loved
the
flavor
and
kick
it
had
not
for
the
weak
this
baby
kicks
d
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
the
hops
dont
overpower
the
flavor
and
the
drink
overall
is
pretty
sweet
and
refreshing
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
van
steenberge
brewery
rich
and
tasty
11
2
oz
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
rich
dark
golden
color
fairly
translucent
with
a
generous
white
fluffy
head
nose
is
hoppier
than
most
big
belgians
ive
had
i
guess
why
they
call
it
a
belgian
ipa
its
worth
noting
that
the
hop
bitterness
is
nowhere
near
a
big
american
ipa
the
hops
do
not
overpower
the
yeast
or
malt
and
its
well
balanced
great
funkiness
in
the
nose
too
i
really
like
their
yeast
strain
taste
is
rich
and
deep
with
a
different
gist
at
both
the
beginning
and
the
end
in
other
words
fairly
complex
hard
to
believe
this
brewery
has
put
out
some
other
beers
that
i
really
didnt
think
were
very
good
this
one
is
a
winner
and
ill
drink
it
again
d
from
the
nose
i
wouldnt
have
expected
this
to
be
as
bitter
as
it
is
but
it
packs
a
wallop
one
i
will
buy
again
no
doubt
drinkability
very
nice
brew
i
am
eager
to
crack
open
and
savor
another
bottle
not
a
bad
beverage
by
any
means
good
representation
of
the
style
its
pretty
easy
to
find
in
my
parts
so
ill
certainly
have
to
pick
this
one
up
a
bit
more
often
d
basically
your
classic
belgian
ale
im
not
sure
if
i
would
classify
it
as
an
ipa
as
its
not
all
that
hoppy
but
its
perfectly
fine
gotta
to
love
the
10
5
though
i
definitely
think
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
piraat
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
few
caveats
if
its
brewers
were
trying
to
create
an
ipa
however
they
really
missed
the
mark
as
the
only
hops
to
be
found
in
this
brew
are
of
the
finishing
variety
and
do
not
play
a
big
role
in
the
taste
regardless
this
is
a
good
bspa
and
ive
certainly
enjoyed
this
bottle
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
even
changes
throughout
the
tasting
this
is
probably
because
of
the
strong
alcohol
content
after
drinking
most
of
the
brew
the
alcohol
becomes
less
present
and
other
flavors
dominate
the
palate
the
initial
flavor
is
a
major
turnoff
tons
of
alcohol
and
some
strange
off
flavors
muffins
and
spaghetti
this
is
not
a
brew
im
going
to
search
for
in
the
future
im
revisiting
by
accident
as
id
forgotten
that
id
had
this
beer
this
is
clearly
a
fresher
sample
as
the
nose
is
hoppier
with
a
nice
dusty
styrian
golding
hop
character
that
rides
over
the
citrus
and
the
spice
some
bubblegum
is
present
too
however
as
it
warms
up
the
sweetness
and
honey
and
booze
take
over
the
palate
is
spicy
and
phenolic
fairly
sharp
with
a
grassy
snap
to
go
with
the
extremely
expressive
yeast
way
overcarbonated
this
beer
is
fairly
drying
on
the
finish
while
well
crafted
this
beer
isnt
realyl
for
my
palate
and
so
im
letting
my
scores
stand
high
level
of
carbonation
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
superb
offering
d
i
know
its
high
abv
i
just
cant
help
it
easy
speasy
drinkability
very
drinkable
just
the
high
abv
lets
its
effects
be
known
d
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
crazy
drinkable
certain
wine
like
characteristics
in
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
really
make
this
a
dangerous
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
the
booze
is
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
but
its
still
a
great
beer
d
good
however
for
a
belgian
ipa
this
lacks
many
components
i
would
have
expected
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
ale
felt
more
like
a
tripel
in
many
respects
an
excellent
ale
choice
that
i
will
revisit
again
again
perhaps
not
a
belgian
ipa
and
perhaps
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
especially
initially
but
at
10
5
we
can
be
a
little
forgiving
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
that
despite
my
overall
hesitancy
with
tripels
i
would
enjoy
having
regular
access
to
this
isnt
horrible
but
the
offflavors
take
what
could
have
been
a
good
beer
and
kinda
kill
it
i
wouldnt
toss
it
away
but
im
not
inclined
to
purchase
it
again
either
o
good
but
not
great
gulden
draak
remains
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
to
this
day
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
got
it
at
9
49
taxdeposit
a
steal
for
quality
stuff
like
this
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
it
is
slightly
warming
on
the
finish
but
still
hides
its
abv
pretty
well
the
hops
provide
a
pleasant
change
to
the
expected
belgian
ale
flavours
i
just
wish
they
provided
a
bit
more
bitterness
as
well
this
has
been
one
of
my
favourites
out
of
the
mixed
sixer
so
far
the
grassycitrus
hop
flavours
work
well
with
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
d
very
drinkable
the
10
5
is
hard
to
notice
at
all
very
little
alcohol
heat
this
beer
would
be
one
of
the
easiest
ive
seen
to
lose
track
of
and
get
messed
up
goes
down
nice
and
easy
a
bit
more
than
it
should
for
the
alcohol
its
a
good
beer
and
id
recommend
anybody
trying
it

a

that
starves
for
attention
this
is
a
stand
out
beer
for
sure
now
matter
how
many
times
you
drink
it
you
cant
help
yourself
from
saying
arrrgghh
after
the
first
sip
i
wouldnt
recommend
taking
big
gulps
of
this
bad
boy
d
very
drinkable
and
im
quite
certain
that
i
will
be
adding

with

i
would
have
another

probably
not

this
as
a

although
the

for

enjoyed

found

drinkable
for

im
not

1
was
plenty
having
seen
this
around
stores
often
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
i
may
pick
some
bottles
up
overall
although
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
triple
i
like
it
a
whole
lot
from
the
lacing
to
the
mouthfeel
piraat
ale
is
a
solid
sipper
has
anyone
tried
aging
this
one
with
positive
results
dtaste
stays
and
amazingly
the
abv
does
not
hit
as
quickly
as
one
would
think
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
sipper
overall
excellent
beer
overall
delicious
flavor
im
not
really
familiar
with
belgian
ipas
so
im
not
sure
if
this
is
typical
of
the
style
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
this
is
delicious
i
recommend
trying
it
out
d
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
only
a
sipper
after
the
first
few
swigs
the
alcohol
creeps
up
and
lets
you
know
it
is
10
5
percent
complexities
dont
follow
the
same
path
and
some
flavors
are
pulled
to
their
ends
all
in
all
still
a
very
tasty
treat
dfor
what
it
isthis
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
but
not
an
exceptional
brew
overall
nothing
lingers
too
long
in
the
aftertaste
and
it
is
a
bit
strong
to
be
drinking
all
night
and
it
may
lose
points
on
originality
but
for
a
hearty
manly
beer
that
gets
it
all
done
right
im
going
to
go
to
this
one
regularly
while
strong
at
10
it
is
a
light
beer
that
you
can
easily
have
a
few
glasses
of
d
really
strong
beer
in
terms
of
abv
and
flavor
profile
a
great
beer
allaround
though
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
great
but
the
flavor
profile
never
really
pops
the
flavors
just
seem
to
melt
together
as
opposed
to
forming
a
strong
identity
this
also
does
not
have
quite
the
hop
presence
for
me
to
consider
this
a
real
belgian
ipa
d
a
very
delicious
light
flavor
even
though
i
loved
this
beer
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
a
lot
for
reasons
i
cant
explain
had
this
on
tap
in
a
tulip
glass
at
cafe
centraal
in
milwaukee
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
large
creamy
head
citrus
fruitcoriander
aromas
abound
this
beer
tastes
nothing
like
an
ipa
even
though
it
is
labeled
as
one
its
more
representative
of
a
belgian
trippel
when
i
think
of
a
belgian
ipa
i
think
of
lechouffe
as
a
prime
example
this
beer
should
be
classified
as
a
trippel
very
high
alcohol
content
which
can
be
tasted
but
the
fruit
aromas
and
fresh
spices
balance
it
out
definitely
has
a
sweet
syrupybready
aftertaste
on
the
mouthfeel
that
lingers
for
awhile
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
nice
spicyfruit
flavors
the
alcohol
is
there
but
you
would
never
guess
that
it
is
10
5
abv
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
most
pepole
reach
for
a
fresh
weiss
beer
or
pilsner
this
beer
was
enjoyable
reviewed
from
notes
i
was
surprised
to
see
here
that
its
a
10
5
beer
it
didnt
taste
anything
like
that
if
you
like
the
standard
belgian
tripel
beers
this
is
a
good
example
and
a
tasty
beer
but
dont
order
it
looking
for
an
ipa
11
2
oz
330ml
bottle
pours
a
apple
juice
color
amber
with
a
foamy
one
finger
head
that
i
find
surprisingly
small
for
a
belgian
ale
the
typical
heavy
belgian
carbonation
is
present
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
apple
juicelike
as
well
also
there
is
a
slightly
doughy
yeast
aroma
in
the
background
1st
sip
brings
an
initial
surge
of
sweet
fruit
apples
apricots
which
gives
way
to
a
dry
spicy
peppery
finish
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overpoweringly
so
its
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
with
a
sparkle
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
session
beer
due
to
the
high
abv
2
or
3
slowly
sipped
over
the
course
of
an
evening
should
do
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
belgian
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
purchase
more
an
update
much
later
ive
now
had
one
that
was
served
far
too
cold
and
the
hops
are
much
more
pronounced
now
it
tastes
like
a
somewhat
hoppy
tripel
tasty
and
approachable
for
what
it
is
even
then
it
doesnt
really
rock
me
as
much
as
most
people
seem
to
feel
about
it
this
is
a
high
abv
beverage
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
these
types
of
brews
it
has
a
dark
golden
hue
a
rich
frothy
head
plenty
of
carbonated
bubbles
and
an
intense
taste
you
can
definitely
taste
the
sugar
in
this
beer
as
it
is
almost
too
sweet
this
is
a
sipping
beer
meant
for
special
occasions
i
am
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
and
wonder
if
this
is
not
as
fresh
as
possible
drinkability
more
like
a
hoppy
bspa
than
a
belgian
ipa
but
i
would
not
argue
with
the
classification
this
beer
was
just
not
to
my
liking
as
i
didnt
care
for
the
boozy
bitterness
just
an
awesome
beer
i
always
enjoy
this
one
great
fruity
taste
to
it
with
a
nice
level
of
tartness
to
combat
the
sweetness
so
many
layers
of
flavor
in
this
beer
from
the
candied
sugar
and
caramel
maltiness
to
the
fruits
like
apple
and
banana
to
the
spicy
flavor
from
the
yeast
there
is
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
10
5
that
isnt
really
a
shocker
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
me
pause
and
reflect
on
why
i
love
beer
so
much
and
dedicate
so
much
time
and
money
to
beer
still
rackin
my
brain
tryin
to
figure
out
what
this
beers
name
means
stupid
foreign
names
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
topped
by
a
stoic
bit
of
white
froth
that
eventually
succumbs
to
the
deleterious
effects
of
gravity
leaving
only
bubbly
rubble
in
its
once
proud
place
the
nose
comprises
hoppy
florals
orange
peel
and
a
touch
o
that
lovely
belgian
spicy
quality
the
taste
ups
the
spice
ante
a
bit
focusing
on
pepper
and
cardamom
while
still
maintaining
a
firm
presence
of
hoppy
citrus
bitters
and
a
belgian
farmhouselike
yeastiness
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
lightactive
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
really
wants
to
be
crisp
and
dryish
overall
a
steady
solid
belgian
offering
nuff
said
a
very
nice
beer
try
it
sometime
there
is
both
a
10
5
and
a
9
version
of
this
beer
330
ml
bottle
courtesy
of
cardinal
pub
bar
stavanger
abv
is
9
extremely
pale
yellow
colour
huge
white
head
strong
sweetish
aroma
with
notes
of
belgian
yeast
ripe
fruits
incl
bananas
and
spices
incl
cloves
the
flavour
is
moderately
spicy
and
relatively
dry
notes
of
belgian
yeast
again
very
light
bodied
and
refreshing
for
its
strength
which
means
that
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
nice
but
ive
had
more
complex
belgians
than
this
one
though
at
eulogy
tavern
in
philadelphia
poured
cloudy
golden
with
one
finger
of
bright
white
head
which
collapsed
fairly
quickly
and
laced
modestly
lots
of
candi
sugar
yeast
coriander
orange
peel
and
some
other
citrus
in
the
nose
the
flavor
yield
copious
amounts
of
apricot
in
addition
to
what
was
detected
in
the
aroma
admittedly
a
robust
and
tasty
mix
but
the
finish
revealed
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
and
afterburn
the
body
was
smooth
medium
and
pleasant
aside
from
the
afterburn
with
only
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
pleasant
albeit
harshfinish
beer
to
drink
beware
the
alcohol
d
delicious
but
heavy
and
hot
enough
to
be
quite
pleased
with
one
and
done
drinkability
awesome
beer
give
it
a
try
youll
like
it
d
i
did
not
realize
this
clocked
in
at
10
and
its
pretty
evident
the
tripel
belgian
flavors
were
real
nice
but
the
ipa
characteristics
were
put
towards
the
back
overall
little
or
no
hops
in
this
bipa
very
malty
and
a
decent
triple
but
does
not
conform
to
style
quite
nice
and
heavily
belgian
despite
the
americanized
style
imho
this
is
a
very
under
appericiated
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
sets
the
bar
hoptacular
and
very
refreshing
i
highly
recommend
this
especially
on
a
hot
day
such
as
this
the
taste
is
sweet
with
all
the
flavors
present
that
i
listed
for
the
aroma
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
5
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
smooth
a
nice
belgian
ipa
which
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
bspa
update
the
abv
is
legit
i
only
had
one
glass
and
i
am
feeling
it
a
must
have
brew
after
any
cyclocross
race
this
fall
heck
after
any
bike
ride
put
a
couple
in
the
creek
make
sure
theyre
hidden
i
am
very
surprised
how
a
105
alcohol
beer
can
be
so
light
tasting
it
tastes
as
light
as
a
german
pilsener
you
can
get
drunk
with
this
very
quickly
so
better
drink
slowly
drinkability
the
10
abv
is
dangerously
hidden
damn
good
brew
so
easy
to
drink
d
enjoyable
but
i
think
some
more
malt
flavors
andor
body
would
help
the
hops
are
not
harsh
but
almost
stand
out
too
much
and
dont
seem
quite
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
still
very
good
summary
piraat
to
me
is
mr
tripel
having
a
child
with
mrs
ipa
the
balance
of
flavors
is
great
in
this
beer
the
330ml
bottle
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
the
bigger
750ml
or
on
tap
though
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
ill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
a
lot
of
great
malty
flavors
with
enough
hoppiness
and
spice
to
keep
it
balanced
and
drinkable
the
booze
bites
on
this
one
which
i
dont
typically
like
but
it
really
compliments
the
spiciness
or
is
it
the
other
way
around
d
an
interesting
beer
the
sweetness
make
me
want
to
drink
faster
but
the
abv
which
is
not
disguised
well
makes
it
a
bit
boozy
drinkabilityi
shared
this
bottle
but
id
have
had
no
problem
finishing
it
off
by
myself
i
could
have
had
another
to
be
honest
its
damn
drinkable
dim
still
confused
by
this
style
ive
had
a
few
versions
of
belgian
ipa
and
they
vary
so
much
from
beer
to
beer
this
version
is
definitely
nice
and
refreshing
its
a
bit
spicy
and
the
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
10
5
i
believe
is
noticeable
at
the
end
of
the
sip
tastedrinkabilitymouthfeel
sweet
and
delicious
the
taste
is
bready
and
sweet
balanced
by
light
citrusy
hops
in
the
background
the
finish
is
pleasant
though
there
is
little
heat
and
a
lasting
mouthcoating
the
carbonation
level
is
mediumhigh
which
is
probably
responsible
for
its
fluffy
texture
on
the
palate
it
also
helps
lighten
the
body
and
certainly
boost
drinkability
this
is
a
high
gravity
bipa
perhaps
it
is
a
bit
too
malty
if
you
love
belgian
strong
pale
ales
this
one
is
for
you
d
just
fantastic
after
a
few
sips
it
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
since
its
so
unique
but
it
really
comes
through
and
gets
very
enjoyable
a
solid
beer
thats
fantastic
and
getting
me
nice
and
saucy
while
listening
to
a
quality
vinyl
d
one
snifter
for
me
thanks
the
ale
is
too
boozy
and
needs
to
add
a
little
more
hop
oomph
pours
a
beautiful
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
nice
thick
white
foam
head
aroma
and
taste
are
sweet
at
first
honeyish
malt
character
followed
up
nicely
by
lemony
peppery
hop
bitterness
very
good
all
around
mouthfeel
is
of
a
typical
belgian
ipa
nice
subtle
carbonation
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
an
ale
of
10
5
abv
oh
well
im
not
complaining
give
me
two
more
and
ill
be
ready
to
take
a
nice
long
nap
overall
a
tasty
user
friendly
ale
md
mouthfeel
is
rich
thick
and
gives
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
end
carbonation
is
heavy
but
doesnt
negatively
affect
flavor
this
is
drinkable
only
because
the
bite
at
the
end
makes
the
mouth
want
the
next
flavor
this
isnt
a
beer
you
drink
two
of
d
its
drinkable
but
watch
out
or
your
ass
will
hit
the
floor
excellent
belgian
ipa
triple
and
strong
pale
ale
in
one
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
this
again
very
exciting
style
of
beer
for
me
as
i
love
both
belgians
and
ipas
and
this
was
possibly
the
best
one
ive
had
my
next
batch
of
homebrew
just
might
be
a
belgian
ipa
drinkability
good
d
this
was
a
surprising
little
beer
that
i
bought
on
a
whim
the
flavor
is
definitely
heavier
and
bolder
than
one
would
think
from
looking
at
it
flavors
are
bold
yet
refreshing
and
crisp
pick
one
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
had
a
glass
of
this
today
and
was
told
it
was
a
belgian
pale
i
immediately
knew
it
wasnt
that
but
i
also
would
have
never
guessed
an
ipa
it
definitely
wasnt
hoppy
enough
for
that
but
i
did
enjoy
it
good
pale
golden
color
light
colored
head
clean
but
belgiany
flavor
i
would
recommend
it
d
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
given
its
high
alcohol
content
moreys
bottom
line
belgians
arent
typically
my
beer
of
choice
but
this
one
is
pretty
quaffable
would
definitely
drink
again
but
due
to
the
price
id
prefer
that
i
wasnt
the
one
paying
for
it
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
very
nice
brew
d
a
sipper
for
sure
would
make
a
nice
warming
after
dinner
brew
one
of
the
first
belgians
i
ever
tried
im
glad
i
revisited
it
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
overpowering
alcohol
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
definatly
not
a
session
drinking
beer
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
mediocre
offering
i
loved
this
beer
when
i
tried
it
a
few
years
ago
and
its
still
really
really
good
drinkabilityi
want
to
say
5
because
a
beer
like
this
you
want
more
of
it
but
the
10
5
i
am
only
drinking
two
for
the
night
it
is
a
sipping
experience
that
you
will
enjoy
notes
its
a
nice
mood
setter
overall
the
sweetness
and
candy
character
take
away
from
the
drinkability
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
and
this
bottle
doesnt
resonate
with
my
memories
could
be
this
bottle
was
oxidized
or
old
if
it
always
tasted
like
this
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
creamy
light
carbonation
bite
on
the
palate
medium
mouthfeel
just
perfect
for
this
beer
highly
drinkable
although
it
has
caught
up
to
me
a
bit
alcoholwise
but
i
was
sipping
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
pint
was
empty
a
good
sign
try
this
the
body
was
good
smooth
and
full
without
being
heavy
or
sticky
drinkability
was
very
good
for
brew
of
this
strength
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
your
time
d
a
tasty
treat
for
once
in
a
while
poured
into
a
chalice
it
has
a
nice
clear
yellowy
golden
color
the
head
on
the
pour
was
barely
half
a
finger
it
was
less
than
i
expected
and
the
carbonation
appears
to
be
much
lower
than
most
belgian
beers
i
have
had
the
aroma
has
the
standard
belgian
sweetness
to
it
of
light
fruits
a
slight
hop
presence
is
noted
as
well
this
has
a
very
smooth
nice
flavor
the
sweetness
is
much
mellower
than
i
was
expecting
on
the
front
the
sip
the
sugary
sweetness
presents
itself
with
perfect
balance
the
sweetness
fades
quickly
to
a
light
crisp
hop
bitterness
that
leaves
an
incredible
finish
this
is
definitely
probably
my
favorite
belgian
beer
i
tend
to
not
like
them
because
i
feel
many
are
overly
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
beer
will
definitely
make
me
look
more
into
the
belgian
ipa
category
d
moderately
drinkable
but
a
sipper
not
a
quaffer
a
bit
too
sweet
a
bit
cloying
and
not
carbonated
enough
still
much
better
than
i
had
originally
found
when
i
first
tried
it
a
different
interpretation
of
a
tripel
with
the
addition
of
some
ipa
qualities
its
sure
to
appeal
to
those
beer
drinkers
who
like
their
hops
but
also
want
their
brew
to
taste
somewhat
sweet
does
need
to
be
a
bit
more
balanced
however
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
i
dont
think
belgian
ipa
when
i
drink
it
but
what
do
i
know
what
do
i
know
you
ask
this
is
a
great
deal
at
2
50
a
bottle
this
will
be
in
front
of
me
again
soon
d
abv
is
very
masked
and
this
ale
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
definitely
want
to
have
more
of
this
in
the
future
drinkability
is
good
this
breer
might
sneak
up
on
10
5
d
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
5
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
bottled
versions
but
is
even
more
elusive
on
draft
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
and
never
look
back
highly
recommended
bottle
into
tulip
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
light
orange
with
a
large
head
the
hung
around
for
the
entire
glass
nose
was
of
slight
citrus
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
banana
the
taste
was
not
disappointing
as
all
of
these
came
through
in
the
mouth
enhanced
by
the
jumpy
carbonation
which
also
brought
forward
a
nice
spicy
bite
at
the
end
this
helped
for
a
very
nice
finish
be
wary
as
the
10
5
could
catch
up
with
you
unfortunately
i
only
had
one
as
this
was
part
of
a
brewers
sampler
definitely
a
unique
ale
and
worth
trying
again
and
again
and
again
great
ipa
belgian
style
is
very
apparent
which
i
enjoy
i
also
enjoyed
stones
cali
belgique
which
is
very
similar
this
marks
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
definitely
not
my
last
unlike
the
american
ipas
ive
grown
to
love
which
place
a
great
emphasis
on
tropical
fruits
and
resiny
hops
this
ones
more
focused
on
the
belgian
yeast
and
spicy
aspects
of
the
beer
which
wonderfully
disguise
the
very
high
abv
as
well
as
highlighting
why
this
brew
has
its
own
style
highly
drinkable
with
a
nice
balance
this
is
definitely
an
easily
quaffable
beer
that
i
could
definitely
have
multiples
in
a
session
although
someone
would
have
to
carry
me
home
i
had
a
small
bottle
but
a
big
bottle
could
of
been
tacklrd
as
well
although
the
10
5
is
a
bit
high
espicially
for
a
belgian
ipa
i
dont
think
ive
ever
heard
of
something
in
this
style
with
that
type
of
alcohol
either
way
it
masks
the
alc
very
well
this
will
leave
you
tipsy
because
its
easy
to
drink
the
sign
of
good
beer
will
try
this
as
fresh
as
possible
next
time
and
revise
this
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprize
to
me
as
it
was
bought
on
a
curious
impulse
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
ipa
i
would
not
categorize
this
as
so
but
thats
not
my
call
i
graded
it
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
its
a
good
one
at
that
drinkability
a
good
sipping
beer
interesting
flavors
and
a
nice
drink
overall
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
this
is
a
style
i
want
to
look
more
into
drinkability
an
excellent
and
very
intriguing
beer
im
honestly
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
the
belgian
ipa
style
is
certainly
complex
and
interesting
ill
certainly
look
for
more
in
this
style
although
it
doesnt
have
a
particularly
alcholic
taste
maybe
that
is
contributing
to
the
bitterness
its
10
abv
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
which
is
to
say
i
shouldnt
drink
more
than
1
of
these
at
a
sitting
i
love
beers
with
with
allusions
to
pirates
they
are
invariably
more
complex
than
ipas
and
in
the
same
happy
high
alcohol
vein
notes
very
interesting
and
wonderful
amazingly
drinkable
too
i
like
this
a
lot
and
will
buy
again
this
one
certainly
packs
a
punch
and
is
light
and
smooth
enough
to
sneak
up
on
you
not
my
preferred
style
but
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
will
undoubtedly
go
back
to
at
some
point
one
of
the
better
belgians
ive
tried
as
the
ratings
suggested
it
would
be
medium
bodied
and
finely
carbonated
feels
round
and
soft
an
exceptional
beer
showing
great
depth
of
flavour
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
mouthfeel
alcohol
dominates
again
throughout
not
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
a
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
feels
alright
and
light
in
the
mouth
okay
carbonation
but
nothing
special
d
a
very
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
recognized
it
as
a
belgian
ipa
mind
you
ive
never
had
this
style
before
and
i
would
expect
their
ipas
to
be
less
inyourface
then
many
in
north
america
ddecent
but
not
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
first
big
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
so
i
might
have
lost
my
taste
for
them
i
dont
think
ive
tasted
anything
out
of
belgium
before
that
didnt
have
a
musty
aroma
or
a
taste
that
reminded
me
of
a
monestary
or
place
of
worship
this
is
a
first
a
pretty
cool
beer
definitely
unique
poured
a
11
2oz
stubby
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
with
a
2inch
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
that
reminds
me
of
lorianne
swiss
cheese
odd
mental
picture
but
thats
the
one
drawn
for
me
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
most
bspas
sweet
pears
and
apples
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
belgian
candy
sugar
i
really
wish
the
hops
were
a
little
more
prevalent
in
the
nose
but
they
really
play
second
fiddle
to
the
malt
thats
used
to
push
the
alcohol
up
to
10
5
the
flavor
is
almost
exactly
the
same
orchard
fruits
big
malty
sweetness
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
tail
i
think
that
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
sweet
the
booze
would
be
almost
untouchable
it
still
shows
it
head
but
its
mostly
covered
by
the
big
malt
body
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
light
leading
to
the
syrupy
body
all
and
all
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wonder
if
maybe
this
is
an
older
bottle
ill
definitely
be
trying
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
and
will
re
review
d
hell
yeah
ill
drink
it
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
sparkling
and
bright
almost
refreshing
this
is
so
easy
drinking
its
scary
it
would
be
very
easy
for
me
to
have
one
too
many
of
this
beer
just
a
great
representation
of
the
style
so
delicious
and
the
alcohol
only
shows
itself
via
a
slight
warming
effect
creamy
bitter
and
mild
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
good
taste
but
packs
a
punch
with
heat
and
hops
when
i
first
began
to
delve
into
craft
beers
i
avoided
piraat
for
several
month
probably
still
would
if
it
hadnt
come
in
a
belgian
holiday
sampler
pack
my
mistake
piraat
is
excellent
though
in
a
different
way
from
other
belgians
found
the
tastes
as
in
the
aroma
and
also
some
minerals
citric
grapefruit
in
the
semidry
bitter
aftertaste
lots
of
hops
here
but
the
flavours
are
not
overpowering
and
the
abv
is
dangerously
well
hidden
drinkability
i
can
really
feel
the
high
abv
here
so
this
is
a
one
per
sitting
beer
the
flavors
are
good
if
not
slightly
muted
due
to
the
alcohol
i
will
most
likely
not
search
for
this
again
overall
enjoyable
enough
but
perhaps
just
a
tad
too
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
for
me
mouth
very
inviting
open
with
a
mouthfull
of
hop
bite
defenitly
a
high
recomendation
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
faintly
yellowish
stained
creamy
head
it
doesnt
retain
its
fluffy
finger
plus
head
appearance
long
but
quickly
fades
back
to
just
a
thin
film
across
the
top
of
the
beer
with
a
monsterous
amount
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
nose
is
slightly
spicy
from
the
hops
and
filled
with
a
mixture
of
cloves
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
taste
is
a
little
bitter
and
has
clove
character
in
the
front
but
it
blends
out
to
a
complex
mixture
of
grain
yeast
malt
and
alcohol
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
with
a
lingering
taste
of
hops
left
on
the
palate
finish
is
also
a
bit
warming
which
is
the
only
indicator
of
the
higher
than
usual
alcohol
light
feel
and
carb
10
5
alcohol
makes
this
beer
dangerous
because
of
how
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
is
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
d
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
slightly
rough
around
the
edges
and
not
as
smooth
bell
weathers
for
the
category
i
would
gladly
welcome
the
chance
to
revisit
and
certainly
not
shy
away
from
in
the
future
the
alcohol
also
makes
no
attempt
to
hide
itself
all
that
being
said
this
one
was
easy
to
go
down
and
still
gone
before
i
know
it
its
still
a
very
good
brew
just
not
head
of
the
class
as
far
as
belgian
ipas
go
this
really
is
a
quite
good
beer
id
happily
buy
it
again
especially
since
its
so
available
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
and
for
my
tastes
its
a
bit
too
much
belgium
and
not
enough
ipa
i
feel
this
would
be
better
if
the
hops
were
heavier
but
it
is
certainly
a
good
beverage
by
any
measure
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
pricetag
per
bottle
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
likely
return
to
piraat
in
the
future
d
i
was
excited
to
try
this
but
i
have
to
admit
i
am
a
little
underwhelmed
the
malt
profile
is
too
thin
here
and
the
alcohol
seems
to
take
too
much
of
a
front
seat
for
my
taste
still
an
interesting
belgian
that
is
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
slight
sweet
malt
alcohol
nuttiness
caramel
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
ipa
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
sweet
malt
alcohol
citrus
and
slight
brown
sugar
overall
a
great
blend
body
aroma
and
drinnkability
picked
one
up
on
a
random
at
the
local
beer
distributing
establishment
pirate
brewed
in
tampa
no
its
brewed
in
belgium
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
this
one
is
in
a
slightly
more
belgian
looking
bottle
than
in
the
pic
above
but
glass
is
glass
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
the
bottle
smell
of
this
brew
has
a
distinct
belgian
whiff
heavy
malts
spices
smells
like
a
hg
brew
pouring
into
a
stemless
wine
glass
yields
a
fizzy
golden
brew
that
has
a
head
that
disappears
quickly
but
continues
to
fizz
like
a
champ
mouthfeel
first
got
any
pancakes
this
is
one
thick
brew
all
joking
aside
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
a
complex
malt
with
slight
spice
undertones
and
a
sweet
yet
dry
bitterness
that
leaves
a
bready
finish
with
hints
of
yeast
most
definitely
warms
through
the
ac
almost
like
a
fine
sherry
but
better
as
a
brew
this
is
one
big
beer
great
malt
and
yeast
combo
almost
weisslike
but
much
heavier
edit
i
didnt
realize
theres
actually
a
category
of
belgian
ipa
and
this
is
in
it
thats
exactly
what
i
wouldve
called
it
either
belgian
ipa
or
hoppy
tripel
very
appropriate
a
new
niche
in
the
world
of
beer
102010
ive
had
several
more
tastings
of
this
beer
the
quality
of
the
product
seems
to
vary
sometimes
its
a
sublime
ipa
sometimes
its
strong
alcoholic
lager
taste
drinkability
at
first
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
as
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
the
more
i
had
of
it
the
better
i
liked
it
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
ill
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
and
would
be
quite
happy
to
have
more
than
one
a
night
if
it
were
not
for
the
abv
level
d
does
not
taste
hoppy
like
ipa
good
i
love
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
everyday
nice
one
d
overall
i
would
say
this
bipa
is
not
bad
but
like
most
i
think
there
should
be
more
hops
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
great
lots
of
complexities
something
i
would
highly
recommend
the
flavors
are
so
melded
and
blended
theyre
even
harder
to
distinguish
than
in
the
aromatics
suffice
it
to
say
this
a
smooth
operator
and
carries
its
10
5
better
than
most
bbws
the
balance
is
nice
though
there
isnt
really
a
wow
factor
to
be
found
the
body
is
medium
full
with
moderate
co2
slick
and
easygoing
finish
is
a
little
sweet
but
with
enough
mild
spiciness
and
twang
to
even
it
out
worth
having
again
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
10
5
abv
will
be
getting
this
one
again
although
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
fine
belgian
india
pale
ale
with
plenty
of
well
hidden
alcohol
and
character
afternoon
delight
the
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
some
for
such
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
still
doesnt
help
the
drinkability
for
me
as
i
still
find
the
aftertaste
a
bit
of
a
downfall
for
this
beer
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
decent
blend
of
earthy
citrus
hops
and
mild
spice
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
spices
and
a
nice
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
but
a
decent
sipper
this
one
is
enjoyable
but
it
looses
a
bit
on
tap
as
most
belgian
beers
do
drinkability
oh
yes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
session
i
love
it
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
finish
is
soft
and
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
a
little
bit
of
bite
crisp
but
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
holds
its
grip
to
the
end
there
is
a
bit
of
unwarranted
tangyness
but
its
impact
is
minimal
overall
a
very
drinkable
very
smooth
and
remarkably
complex
beer
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
christoffel
blonde
mostly
because
of
its
grainy
character
and
saazlike
hopping
its
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
belgian
ipa
i
begining
to
wonder
if
the
sampler
pack
from
the
brewery
is
not
of
highest
quality
this
is
about
the
3rd
beer
from
the
set
that
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
conclusion
i
was
really
hoping
to
be
wowed
by
this
but
i
just
wasnt
might
be
too
sweet
warm
for
mass
consumption
but
im
sure
its
good
surprisingly
mild
flavor
given
the
style
and
abv
with
subtle
hints
of
floral
grassy
hops
and
some
bananarich
yeast
esters
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
that
suggests
a
tropicalflavored
spirit
body
is
bubbly
and
lighter
on
the
palate
than
i
had
anticipated
as
the
spritziness
draws
out
some
of
the
more
subtle
hop
notes
crisp
clean
finish
with
a
slight
linger
of
booze
and
grass
not
the
most
remarkable
belgian
ipa
and
the
10
5
certainly
limits
its
drinkability
but
piraat
makes
a
nice
sipper
for
those
slower
evenings
drinkability
i
can
only
say
that
this
is
way
too
drinkable
for
a
10
5
beer
ill
definitely
be
getting
this
one
some
more
pours
a
clear
golden
color
not
too
much
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
surprising
hoppy
some
distinct
spice
notes
clove
coriander
and
pine
taste
is
quite
sharp
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
nice
punch
from
the
hops
some
mild
malt
flavor
mostly
spicy
yeast
alcohol
is
quite
hidden
wonderful
belgian
body
to
really
quite
good
extremely
easy
drinking
highly
enjoyable
this
is
good
belgium
ipa
that
i
reccomend
to
everybody
anyone
who
enjoys
beer
should
like
this
style
of
ale
even
my
wife
dug
it
and
it
kicks
ass
weighing
in
at
10
5
mmm
try
some
if
you
getthe
chance
a
lil
pricey
but
worth
the
money

silky
champagnelike
flavor
taste
is
sweet
some
spices
clove
coriander
fruits
but
not
as
distinctive
as
in
the
aroma
its
fairly
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
carbonation
nice
and
creamy
this
is
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
doesnt
become
any
harder
to
drink
as
it
warms
good
beer
all
in
all
this
makes
for
a
nice
warming
beer
but
i
cant
say
the
taste
was
all
that
impressive
in
a
sea
of
excellent
belgian
tripels
ill
probably
spend
my
bounty
elsewhere
next
time
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
and
wont
finish
the
bottle
funny
thing
but
mericans
seem
to
hit
belgian
styles
a
lot
better
than
belgians
hit
merican
styles
know
what
i
mean
drinkability
very
nice
i
didnt
really
like
the
smell
but
it
warmed
nice
and
mild
even
with
the
alcohol
mrtapy
i
would
love
to
try
this
from
a
bottle
as
i
think
it
might
be
a
completely
different
experience
the
lower
drinkability
score
stems
from
the
high
alcohol
not
a
session
by
any
stretch
but
a
lovely
way
to
pass
the
day
regardless
this
beer
came
in
a
330ml
bottle
that
looks
very
similar
to
the
duvel
bottle
and
it
pours
a
orange
mahogany
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
forms
a
one
finger
cream
coloured
head
with
heaps
of
visible
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glassit
actually
smells
quite
subtle
for
a
beer
that
is
10
5
it
has
nice
aromas
of
maltcandyyeast
and
a
faint
alcohol
backgroundit
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
yet
is
light
in
body
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hiddenit
has
nice
tastes
of
breadmaltdough
and
candy
and
finishes
quite
easy
actually
no
hint
of
overwhelming
alcohol
still
cant
believe
this
is
10
5
more
like
5a
very
nice
beer
that
would
recommend
d
still
rather
drinkable
for
such
a
large
beer
though
this
bottle
is
inferior
to
the
draft
version
i
had
a
week
or
so
ago
served
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
golden
in
color
relatively
clear
moderate
head
smell
was
lighter
than
expected
but
still
present
and
pleasant
mouth
feel
was
full
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
while
and
it
was
my
fourth
of
the
night
it
was
as
good
as
i
remembered
and
i
am
thrilled
to
recommend
this
beer
to
those
belgian
fans
out
there
of
which
there
are
millions
tastes
like
a
really
strong
belgianized
braggot
it
is
unique
and
quite
good
but
it
is
not
my
favourite
belgian
and
i
really
dont
get
the
whole
ipa
thing
this
beer
supposedly
has
the
10
booze
in
this
one
does
not
even
make
a
statement
crisp
light
bodied
easy
drinking
triple
makes
this
a
must
on
your
try
list
light
amber
color
with
a
foam
head
that
is
an
offwhite
and
about
1
or
2
cm
in
thickness
but
i
am
at
a
bar
and
dont
exactly
have
a
ruler
the
nose
is
faint
but
is
malty
and
has
some
touches
of
grain
that
promise
some
turns
in
the
flavor
other
than
from
whatever
hops
is
hidden
in
there
there
is
a
sweet
and
fruity
sensation
to
the
attack
the
flavor
is
candy
like
in
its
sweetness
a
little
bit
boozy
and
some
grain
notes
at
the
finish
this
warms
in
the
belly
as
you
finish
it
the
mouthfeel
appears
to
thicken
during
the
flavor
and
then
finishes
hot
a
great
tripel
and
imo
a
beer
a
lot
of
people
forget
or
dont
know
about
it
deserves
the
high
marks
it
gets
when
reviewed
one
bottle
will
do
you
right
buy
two
if
you
can
afford
it
and
share
with
a
bud
all
in
all
this
is
an
interestingly
complex
beer
and
deserves
another
stab
in
the
cooler
season
time
this
does
indeed
taste
like
a
soso
yankee
ipa
merged
with
a
big
belgian
pale
ale
or
tripel
and
further
with
some
rather
unassuming
malt
liquor
the
belgian
side
does
seem
to
win
out
given
the
fruity
yeasty
and
alcoholic
notes
herein
any
americanstyle
ipa
hopping
is
barely
perceptible
here
which
is
fine
but
the
denomination
leaves
something
to
be
desired
and
is
a
bit
misleading
but
that
aside
this
is
a
very
well
made
more
hoppy
than
usual
strong
belgian
pale
ale
all
in
all
a
very
solid
very
delicious
strong
belgian
ale
the
belgian
ipa
classification
seems
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
to
me
as
the
hop
character
was
quite
subdued
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
is
wellconstructed
tis
good
to
see
some
more
pirates
in
the
beer
realm
mfd
the
body
is
perfectly
viscous
not
too
much
but
not
watery
just
enough
body
that
ones
doesnt
notice
either
a
lack
or
a
excess
carbonation
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
mediumlight
body
a
strong
crisp
carbonation
to
help
offset
some
of
the
boozes
power
i
would
easily
session
this
beer
if
on
tap
i
was
going
to
do
a
rod
stewart
themed
review
next
time
next
time
d
average
drinkability
for
the
style
very
belgianesque
i
think
the
ipa
designation
is
a
bit
misleading
very
good
beer
though
it
was
a
close
tie
between
this
and
gulden
draak
for
which
one
i
was
going
to
try
to
clone
had
this
the
other
night
at
home
out
of
a
chimay
glass
poured
a
bronzecopper
color
with
creamy
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
smelled
very
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
spice
tasted
of
yeast
raisins
and
spice
with
a
mild
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
but
slightly
oily
this
was
definitely
a
sipping
beer
no
more
than
2
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass

this
is
what
its
all
about
for
me
complex
yeast
great
balance
of
flavors
refreshing
and
yet
a
sipper
ive
found
my
hidden
treasure
arrrrrr
this
is
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
i
like
this
style
so
im
a
sucker
this
gives
duvel
a
run
for
the
money
a
little
more
carmel
flavor
than
duvel
and
a
little
less
head
dont
let
the
funky
label
scare
you
this
is
world
class
beer
all
the
way
i
havent
been
able
to
find
this
one
in
a
larger
bottle
but
if
i
could
id
love
to
see
if
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
changes
the
flavor
profile
at
all
not
bad
but
not
something
id
drink
again
too
much
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
it
feels
like
syrup
in
the
mouth
while
i
do
appreciate
the
kick
of
bitterness
on
the
end
its
not
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
oh
and
also
the
abv
is
quite
high
even
though
doesnt
really
translate
into
the
fluid
drinkability
is
really
high
despite
the
abv
and
the
price
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
bottle
from
time
to
time
i
would
really
like
to
put
it
up
against
houblon
chouffe
in
a
sidebyside
tasting
just
to
highlight
the
differences
between
the
two
d
10
5
sheesh
and
its
soooo
easy
to
drink
easy
boy
fruitier
than
im
looking
for
in
a
belgian
ipa
and
not
enough
hops
maybe
this
was
a
subpar
bottle
d
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
an
intense
ride
for
sure
but
well
worth
it
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
blond
personally
id
probably
reach
for
something
else
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
m
d
a
sharp
twang
of
carbonation
to
start
smoothing
out
into
a
slick
body
slightly
sparkling
and
finishing
quite
nice
and
dry
nicely
done
with
a
lasting
flavour
left
in
the
mouth
for
some
time
along
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
warming
d
very
high
drinkability
for
a
10
5
abv
all
in
allthis
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
am
just
getting
into
belgian
beer
and
i
think
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
d
a
strong
golden
belgian
with
a
distinctly
spicy
yeast
profile
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
it
hides
its
high
alcohol
content
well
there
is
a
nice
hop
character
but
the
yeast
dominates
and
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
same
category
as
other
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
had
drinkability
for
me
too
many
things
were
working
against
this
beer
this
wasnt
offensive
but
the
levels
of
alcohol
and
spice
really
didnt
work
together
on
this
beer
its
a
super
clean
and
delicious
brew
very
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
the
sweeter
honey
flavors
here
as
well
as
the
toasty
white
bread
piraat
ale
is
hazy
bubbly
and
golden
with
a
thick
fluffy
frothy
yellowed
head
that
has
great
retention
and
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
bread
pepper
clove
and
bubblegum
it
has
a
smooth
and
fluffy
medium
body
with
a
clean
finish
there
are
notes
of
leather
and
black
pepper
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
quite
prominent
there
really
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
bitterness
or
sweetness
other
flavors
slowly
reveal
themselves
notably
pear
the
flavors
are
well
blended
and
well
balanced
but
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
little
distracting
quite
good
but
not
the
hop
pressence
i
was
anticipating
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
witha
big
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
sweet
malt
with
some
yeasty
presence
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
and
spices
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
honeylike
malt
that
gives
away
to
a
huge
blast
of
alcohol
that
finishes
off
with
some
slight
bitterness
and
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
and
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
for
having
such
a
high
alcohol
content
this
is
pretty
strong
and
noticeably
strong
at
that
it
is
very
tasty
and
interesting
ive
had
the
belgian
take
on
the
ipa
a
few
times
before
and
have
found
it
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
what
happens
when
a
monk
gets
their
hands
on
a
heavy
load
of
hops
very
solid
beer
d
a
little
overpowering
to
go
through
more
than
one
of
but
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
its
fine
relatively
interesting
but
not
enough
appeal
for
me
to
go
back
to
it
pours
a
rich
goldenbrown
with
a
nice
beige
head
the
nose
has
bready
malts
tropical
fruits
peppery
alcohol
and
spicy
yeast
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
well
balanced
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
than
belgian
ipa
as
the
hops
presence
is
very
subtle
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
tasty
stuff
just
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
examples
of
teh
style
330ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
copper
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
looking
almost
like
ice
cream
great
nose
hops
and
sweetness
taste
is
quite
interesting
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
a
little
peppery
and
the
alcohol
warms
my
insides
quite
nicely
definitely
worth
sampling
again
on
tasting
one
is
struck
first
by
a
velvet
smooth
mouthfeel
and
delightful
texture
taste
is
not
up
to
the
same
standard
however
with
a
bitter
sourness
yeasty
notes
and
lots
of
grapefruit
the
alcohol
comes
out
in
the
finish
and
it
feels
like
ive
had
a
good
shot
of
an
80
proof
liquor
not
all
that
pleasant
im
not
sure
what
it
was
that
was
missing
that
would
make
this
a
really
good
beer
maybe
it
was
malt
gone
awol
in
the
finish
it
had
an
unsettling
drop
off
on
the
swallow
that
took
away
from
the
drinkability
of
it
all
maybe
a
freasher
bottle
might
be
a
good
idea
ill
give
that
a
try
wow
too
much
hidden
alcohol
bombastic
delicious
and
full
bodied
wow
as
far
as
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
but
no
session
beer
pours
clear
and
golden
aroma
is
bananas
cloves
nutmeg
light
fruit
flavor
starts
with
more
light
fruit
cantaloupe
and
finishes
with
a
tart
slightly
bitter
tart
kick
and
a
spicy
clove
exhale
feel
has
a
nice
carbonation
which
contributes
to
the
kick
the
alcohol
is
quite
high
and
is
felt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
deep
amber
in
color
foamy
one
finger
head
smells
like
alcohol
almost
like
malt
liquor
and
a
little
bit
of
piney
hop
rich
and
heavy
in
the
mouth
little
spice
fruity
and
alcohol
with
a
dry
finish
one
or
two
would
be
more
than
good
enough
for
me
as
far
as
belgians
go
this
was
a
great
beer
it
had
a
great
head
and
the
beer
looked
full
of
life
it
smelled
great
with
lots
of
fruit
and
spices
i
expected
a
bitter
beer
for
9
but
piraat
blonde
was
nice
and
mild
tasting
it
was
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
had
thus
far
drinkability
a
sipper
unless
your
tolerance
is
that
of
an
irish
sink
drain
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
while
watching
a
sports
event
one
beer
that
feels
like
youve
had
three
when
youre
finished
pretty
good
overall
d
among
the
better
i
have
had
of
the
style
something
where
i
would
not
necessarily
choose
this
over
a
hopdelivery
vehicle
like
hopslam
but
you
cant
compare
for
what
this
is
and
what
it
tries
to
be
it
is
spot
on
well
crafted
and
fully
enjoyed
out
of
squat
brown
little
bottle
this
beer
was
a
goldamber
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
threefinger
head
was
offwhite
and
retained
well
as
a
fluffy
cap
leaving
bands
of
lacing
like
garters
as
i
drank
it
the
aroma
was
of
belgian
yeast
pale
malt
floral
hops
and
a
light
spiciness
the
flavors
were
complex
well
developed
and
balanced
i
tasted
floral
and
citrus
hops
first
followed
by
belgian
yeast
white
pepper
light
cloves
some
fruit
esters
alcohol
heat
and
then
both
caramel
malt
and
some
doughy
pale
malt
towards
the
end
left
a
slight
slick
on
my
tongue
but
the
palate
was
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
luxurious
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
delicate
great
overall
and
a
joy
to
drink
d
excellent
this
is
one
hell
of
a
brew
well
worth
a
try
i
would
score
it
higher
if
it
was
listed
as
a
trippel
d
decent
not
the
best
bipa
ive
had
and
id
even
be
hesitant
to
call
it
one
at
all
due
to
the
lack
of
hoppiness
no
problem
drinking
it
though
this
was
fairly
tasty
d
definitely
need
to
get
more
of
these
this
is
one
belgian
blonde
that
forsakes
the
traditional
strong
yeastiness
for
a
jampacked
infinitely
juicy
fruitiness
d
very
easy
to
drink
beer
which
makes
that
10
5
pretty
dangerous
but
oh
so
good
supposed
to
be
known
as
popular
among
cigar
lovers
which
is
probably
why
i
like
it
d
its
never
going
to
be
one
youll
pound
but
it
isnt
anywhere
near
as
difficult
to
drink
as
it
probably
should
be
an
excellent
choice
when
you
want
a
big
belgian
blonde
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
problem
arrr
the
taste
was
slight
alcoholheavy
but
not
too
much
for
my
taste
the
flavor
was
strong
banana
and
honey
with
a
slight
amount
of
malts
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
and
was
overall
impressed
with
this
ale
this
is
my
first
from
this
brewer
and
will
definitely
have
more
highly
recommended
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
belgian
ales
not
exactly
sessionable
but
i
could
certainly
drink
2
or
3
if
i
wanted
to
picked
up
a
single
of
this
at
greens
on
buford
highway
in
atlanta
poured
into
my
boulevard
chalice
poured
an
orange
color
with
minimal
head
good
amount
of
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
belgian
yeast
and
orange
peel
tastes
slightly
citrusy
with
the
belgian
yeast
acting
as
the
most
prevalent
taste
ends
slightly
bitter
good
mouthfeel
as
there
is
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
notes
i
have
had
augustijn
on
tap
previously
by
this
brewer
brouwerij
van
steenberge
loved
it
and
this
is
as
good
or
better
bought
an
interesting
6
pack
sampler
and
look
forward
to
the
other
5
overall
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
drinkability
paired
well
with
lazy
confessions
by
the
moldy
peaches
though
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
its
not
glaring
or
as
a
wise
man
once
said
it
drink
pretty
good
dont
it
however
when
the
plummeting
us
economy
drives
me
to
a
piratebased
livelihood
ill
probably
stick
to
dark
rum
instead
of
piraat
thats
just
me
though
its
quite
smooth
but
its
a
heady
brew
and
the
alcohol
edge
is
just
a
little
too
raw
for
me
aroma
isnt
too
impressive
here
just
a
sweet
alcohol
scent
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
just
were
it
needs
to
be
this
is
a
good
blonde
with
very
little
imperfections
to
it
so
far
if
you
come
across
this
brand
try
one
and
judge
for
yourself
i
think
its
a
good
beer
d
different
style
so
youve
got
to
be
open
to
that
easy
drinking
over
all
abv
was
no
where
to
be
tasted
so
that
made
things
smoother
d
man
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
seems
very
well
respected
amongst
the
world
community
and
i
can
see
some
reasons
why
otherwise
i
am
not
totally
sure
about
this
one
being
a
world
class
brew
no
doubt
it
is
good
pours
with
a
light
white
head
pools
into
bubble
islands
over
the
surface
attractive
lacing
clings
for
a
moderate
period
light
orange
to
yellow
color
gauzy
and
unconcentrated
hue
allows
for
flickering
hues
and
slight
visibility
of
the
bubble
beads
wet
hay
clay
and
dried
orange
peels
set
the
stage
for
the
nose
the
coriander
clove
spice
is
very
restrained
and
classy
golden
apple
banana
pear
fruit
with
a
light
glaze
of
honey
on
the
whole
the
alcohol
is
masked
quite
nicely
fullbodied
yet
smooth
and
easygoing
this
in
turn
without
sacrificing
the
kind
of
stickiness
required
to
ensure
flavor
intensity
the
carbonation
is
too
aggressive
through
the

entry
but
does
fall
into
line

lemon
citrus
on
the

side
here
however
sparked
by
fruit
flavors
of
pineapple
green
apple

and
apricot
some
banana
but
plays
err
second
banana
the
grass
straw
tobacco
ash
and
stone
notes
come
out
stronger
as
it
warms
gives
you
a
pleasing
bitter
twist
at
the
end
for
contrast
excellent
refreshing
brew
great
palate
and
high
drinkability
pours
a
hazy
almost
glowing
golden
hue
with
minimal
white
white
very
subdued
aromas
suggesting
sweet
fruity
malts
which
indeed
feature
prominently
on
the
palate
but
are
balanced
by
light
citrusy
hops
finish
is
warm
sweet
and
yeasty
medium
body
is
finely
carbonated
perfectly
weighted
to
maximize
enjoyment
of
the
rich
flavors
drinks
beautifully
all
on
its
own
fantastic
beer
to
have
on
hand
during
the
winter
very
nice
belgie
notes
i
cant
tell
you
how
presently
surprised
i
am
at
this
beer
i
would
put
it
right
up
there
with
tremens
d
this
is
a
decently
wellmade
beer
though
not
my
favorite
among
belgians
still
a
solid
effort
perhaps
this
was
an
off
bottle
this
really
disappointed
i
had
a
tough
time
finishing
drinkability
is
good
enjoyable
pleasant
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
very
enjoyable
would
recommend
and
would
enjoy
again

smooth

subdued
flavor
compared
to
the

different
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
hard
to
imagine
a
belgium
ale
sending
me
down
to
the
steamy
equator
but
thats
where
the
pirates
play
and
i
shall
drink
these
like
a
pirate
had
a
bottle
while
watching
football
this
past
sunday
at
common
ground
poured
into
a
smallish
stemmed
tulip
glass
extremely
golden
color
very
clear
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
can
really
smell
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
too
didnt
taste
overly
hoppy
though
the
hop
bite
was
there
but
the
wonderful
doughy
flavor
kept
the
flavor
moving
a
great
ipa
but
the
high
alcohol
content
makes
this
one
to
savor
and
not
drink
quickly
an
oldschool
belgian
favorite
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
second
or
even
fourth
choice
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
the
piraat
on
too
many
occasions
now
to
count
and
by
the
end
always
found
a
way
to
enjoy
it
that
affection
never
comes
quick
however
and
isnt
automatic
the
next
time
around
either
the
van
steenberge
lineup
can
be
hit
or
miss
and
the
same
could
be
said
of
this
offering
myself
personally
i
dont
care
to
take
another
shot
but
you
feel
free
to
served
from
a
33cl
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
had
a
very
malty
and
yeasty
fruit
aroma
that
almost
overpowered
the
nose
taste
was
that
of
bubble
gum
honey
spice
yeast
and
alcohol
felt
highly
carbonated
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
finish
that
was
dry
and
alcoholic
on
the
palate
nothing
like
a
strong
belgian
ale
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
ensures
a
good
time
for
all
d
a
nice
beer
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
consume
doesnt
come
across
as
being
as
strong
as
it
is
good
thing
i
only
had
one
bottle
available
rich
golden
opaque
color
with
about
a
one
finger
white
head
that
holds
well
and
some
lacing
aroma
actually
gets
better
as
the
beer
sits
with
fruity
sweet
candy
notes
and
hints
of
spice
nicely
spiced
big
flavors
with
cinnamon
and
pepper
and
a
sweet
fruity
taste
then
the
warmth
hits
for
a
great
finish
only
had
the
one
11
2
oz
stubby
bottle
but
at
10
5
alcohol
its
not
session
beer
but
i
sure
wish
i
had
another
notes
wow
what
a
unique
beer
maybe
its
because
this
is
my
first
belgian
ipa
it
relies
on
elements
im
not
normally
fond
of
namely
carbonation
and
alcohol
and
yet
im
enjoying
this
beer
tremendously
thats
either
great
craftsmanship
or
good
hype
either
way
ill
gladly
have
this
one
again
notes
if
this
beer
had
a
full
rich
head
in
my
tulip
like
it
does
in
the
tulip
on
the
label
it
would
probably
be
an
a
instead
of
a
b
the
appearance
in
the
glass
combined
with
the
smell
are
sending
the
exact
wrong
message
ignoring
them
though
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
bottle
in
a
belgian
sample
pack
i
received
for
christmas
golden
slightly
cloudy
pour
into
a
trappist
glass
large
white
fizzy
frothy
head
aroma
of
bananas
yeast
and
some
spices
nice
dry
taste
of
slight
hops
with
belgian
yeast
and
a
nice
full

pours
a

with
a
large

some
sticking
nose
of
bitter
hops
coriander
all
spice
and
thick
bready

lots
of
the
same
characteristics
going
on
in
its
flavor
sweet
and
sturdy
pale

support
the
body
lots
of
bitter
dry
hops
and
classic
belgian
yeast
and

mediumfull
body
bright
with
carbonation
easy
enough
to
drink
but
id
be
satisfied
with
just
one
or
2
d
this
one
is
sneaky
very
easy
drinking
one
that
goes
down
well
all
night
without
any
distinct
alcohol
taste
excellent
high
alcohol
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
overall
a
great
beer
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
your
traditional
pale
ales
and
as
a
belgian
it
stands
up
well
with
comparable
beers
its
hard
to
find
a
bad
beer
from
the
van
steenberge
lineup
very
unique
and
very
drinkable
a
superb
beer
and
a
reason
to
buy
the
belgian
sampler
sixpack
that
i
got
this
one
from
the
beautifully
crafted
hop
component
mandates
freshness
to
enjoy
this
beer
at
its
fullest
among
the
easier
belgian
ipa
to
track
down
in
the
us
this
is
a
delightful
treat
on
tap
smells
and
tastes
of
a
perfect
proportion
of
hops
and
spices
notably
cloves
the
alcohol
content
is
present
in
the
taste
but
beneficial
and
certainly
not
overwhelming
and
in
spite
of
such
a
strong
flavor
and
high
abv
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
good
choice
for
an
introductory
beer
where
others
might
be
too
intense
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
an
atractive
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
the
spicy
triple
taste
is
obvious
via
the
belgian
yeast
i
really
do
not
notice
the
hoppy
characteristics
it
taste
like
a
standard
triple
to
me
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
piraat
is
deceptively
drinkable
given
its
high
abv
not
my
favorite
style
i
would
rather
have
an
ipa
or
a
triple
that
being
said
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
fave
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
big
billowing
head
apple
peel
yeast
clove
aromas
with
some
orange
lemon
and
spicy
hops
carbonated
and
light
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
bready
malt
orange
and
citrus
the
beer
has
a
sourish
palate
presence
a
yeasty
dry
finish
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
others
in
the
genre
are
better
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
astonishing
the
mildly
honeylike
texture
mixed
with
a
spicy
flowery
taste
and
a
glowing
golden
color
should
please
anyone
the
high
weight
is
very
well
blended
too
as
one
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
its
just
an
aspect
of
the
many
flavors
washing
through
the
nose
and
over
the
tongue
the
beer
is
a
little
too
gassy
but
this
distinction
gives
me
something
to
think
about
which
is
great
good
beer
what
else
can
i
say
d
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
i
have
passed
this
by
on
numerous
occasions
but
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
for
10
5
abv
this
doesnt
really
drink
like
it
i
would
pair
this
with
soft
cheeses
especially
a
brie
or
camembert
bread
cheese
grapes
and
crackers
would
pair
wonderfully
d
overall
drinkability
was
only
slightly
better
then
average
at
best
much
better
examples
per
style
as
this
one
comes
off
pretty
bland
and
ordinary
this
was
my
third
time
sampling
and
havent
grown
to
like
it
yet
would
buy
this
again
interesting
very
complex
awful
pours
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
orange
peel
spice
and
malt
in
the
aroma
taste
was
a
metallic
straw
flavor
with
some
malt
and
spice
a
dirtlike
finish
judging
by
the
other
ratings
i
may
have
got
a
bad
one
but
the
one
i
got
does
not
make
me
want
to
find
out
for
sure
bottom
line
a
nice
belgian
ale
worth
trying
if
i
had
any
complaints
it
is
that
this
is
a
bit
aggresive
but
then
again
so
are
pirates
i
guess
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
me
it
warms
you
very
nicely
high
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
not
carefull
cheers
330
ml
bottle
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
piraat
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
it
smells
like
pears
apples
candy
sugar
belgian
yeast
honey
peppery
spice
and
cloves
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
stronger
its
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
its
strong
and
intense
tasting
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
lively
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
10
5
abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
in
the
taste
but
you
can
feel
it
after
a
while
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
d
very
good
and
representative
of
the
belgian
ale
style
also
good
since
only
slightly
warming
this
is
definitely
a
good
looking
beer
with
a
goldenamber
color
and
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
has
good
lace
throughout
consumption
there
is
some
fruitiness
to
the
taste
but
overall
its
not
very
strong
it
has
some
bitter
taste
too
not
a
bad
beer
good
beer
overall
the
nose
is
very
fruity
grapes
plums
lemons
etc
the
appearance
is
goldenorange
in
color
and
clear
thin
white
head
the
flavor
is
dry
but
fruity
a
mix
of
sweet
grapes
and
citrusy
fruits
the
finish
has
a
strong
hop
bittering
not
previously
detected
and
has
a
citrus
quality
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
thickness
good
beer
overall
it
drinks
much
smaller
than
a
10
5
abv
beer
so
be
very
careful
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
nicely
balanced
and
surprisingly
easydrinking
despite
the
high
abv
d
its
pretty
darn
good
but
it
would
destroy
my
palate
after
a
couple
why
yes
sir
ill
have
another
drinkability
great
slightly
astringent
bitter
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
would
drink
it
again
reminds
me
of
duvel
but
a
rougher
cousin
which
makes
it
all
the
better
overall
an
excellent
belgian
beer
reminds
me
a
tripel
style
ale
could
use
a
little
bit
more
hops
for
an
ipa
otherwise
a
great
beer
definitely
an
introduction
to
belgians
type
of
beer
will
buy
this
again
when
the
mood
arises
dgreat
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
belgian
beer
very
friendly
and
tasty
d
it
was
light
and
packed
a
punch
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
a
tad
over
carbonated
and
it
needed
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
citrus
and
spices
nice
beer
that
could
support
a
long
summer
session
this
beer
went
down
easy
despite
the
high
abv
i
would
not
say
it
is
highly
drinkable
because
of
the
fact
that
too
many
of
these
and
you
would
be
absolutely
wasted
and
poor
despite
these
facts
i
give
piraat
a
4
0
for
this
mark
enjoy
this
beer
carefully
this
stuffs
pretty
tasty
but
the
mouthfeel
really
bummed
me
out
i
thought
it
might
be
a
bit
better
pours
up
a
golden
color
with
a
big
frothy
off
white
head
great
lacing
the
nose
is
grains
honey
pale
malts
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
floral
hops
honey
sweet
malts
grains
a
very
sweet
brew
medium
body
medium
carbo
sweet
finish
fantastic
beer
intense
complex
strong
i
think
that
pouring
a
piraat
into
a
properly
chilled
goblet
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
a
beer
drinker
can
experience
it
pours
a
rich
golden
amber
with
two
to
three
fingers
of
head
nice
lacing
its
sweeter
than
some
people
care
for
but
once
i
get
used
to
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
i
love
it
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
750ml
corked
caged
dont
know
what
to
expect
amber
triple
ipa
i
thought
that
was
three
different
styles
color
is
pale
almost
luminous
gold
with
active
carbonation
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
very
pronounced
apparent
the
moment
you
pop
the
cork
lemons
pepper
grassy
and
a
hint
of
sugar
very
intriguing
a
definite
hop
presence
the
taste
is
wonderful
a
touch
medicinal
taste
of
hay
a
smooth
caramel
back
pepper
finish
very
complex
but
surprisingly
light
theres
vanilla
in
there
too
somewhere
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
very
very
nicely
carbonated
again
a
balancing
act
that
the
beer
pulls
off
very
well
this
one
is
very
drinkable
with
the
malt
making
you
want
more
the
hops
making
it
seem
light
enough
to
let
you
drink
a
lot
and
a
pleasant
alcohol
warmth
that
just
makes
my
toes
tingle
good
on
ya
brouwerij
van
steenberge
d
strong
spices
and
high
percent
make
it
not
so
drinkable
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
though
drinks
pretty
good
this
is
more
of
a
nightcap
or
dessert
type
offering
drinkability
is
ok
but
its
too
boozy
and
not
enough
hop
flavor
or
aroma
or
the
ones
they
used
are
too
grassy
a
easy
way
to
get
drunk
but
not
one
to
savor
orange
hue
with
nice
clingy
head
that
sticks
around
tart
smell
tries
to
masks
the
alcohol
but
cant
cover
up
the
lethal
dose
light
bodied
in
feel
that
evolves
from
sour
orange
to
beautiful
tart
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
alcoholic
kick
that
warms
the
palate
a
gorgeous
bold
triple
that
can
play
the
role
of
a
late
nightcap
or
an
afternoon
break
away
from
the
sun
but
the
alcohol
could
leave
you
half
in
the
bag
pretty
early
poured
a
clear
but
not
brilliant
gold
body
color
with
cumulus
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
like
what
youd
see
atop
a
duvel
sticky
and
lasts
forever
aroma
is
of
champagne
bread
yeast
and
candied
fruit
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
again
champagnelike
but
i
felt
it
lacked
structure
or
backbone
its
all
melody
and
no
harmony
if
you
will
i
felt
like
it
needed
more
malt
to
balance
out
the
other
flavors
that
are
present
mouthfeel
is
light
like
cotton
candy
hides
its
10
5
scarily
well
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
liked
it
but
it
hardly
blew
my
socks
off
im
glad
i
still
have
3
more
to
go
good
but
by
no
means
one
of
the
5
best
in
the
world
the
piraat
blond
is
better
hard
for
me
to
nail
this
style
as
im
still
new
to
it
however
this
beer
does
seem
drinkable
to
an
extent
the
carbonation
is
strong
and
ditto
for
the
alcohol
with
some
aging
this
beer
will
be
magnificent
otherwise
its
a
good
take
at
a
relatively
new
style
definitely
a
beer
i
will
purchase
again
piraat
is
superb
all
around
the
drink
has
a
beefy
medium
body
and
damnednear
perfect
carbonation
to
lighten
it
to
quaffability
and
all
without
any
real
indication
of
the
whopping
10
5
abv
notes
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
drink
this
beer
from
tap
tonight
i
highly
recommend
it
the
taste
was
a
funky
yeast
taste
i
am
used
to
tasting
with
a
belgian
this
is
my
first
ipa
of
the
country
the
malt
was
fairly
in
the
background
with
the
hoppiness
taking
most
of
the
drink
i
found
the
piraat
to
be
a
delicious
soft
version
a
normal
ipa
i
wish
i
could
of
had
the
large
size
instead
of
the
11
2
oz
bottle
appears
like
gold
champagne
with
a
beer
head
smell
is
like
nutmeg
and
pear
the
taste
is
similar
to
an
apple
or
pear
with
a
definite
nutmeg
taste
a
big
sip
is
yeasty
with
a
mild
malt
finish
moreso
then
any
other
ipa
i
have
ever
drank
mouthfeel
is
definitely
bubbly
and
champagne
feel
i
could
easily
throwback
one
of
these
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
marriage
of
characteristics
of
an
ipa
and
belgian
triple
conclusion
my
initial
sips
left
me
with
lukewarm
feelings
for
this
beer
but
after
deep
scrutiny
i
have
concluded
that
this
beer
just
rocks
every
sip
the
flavor
is
slightly
different
every
5
sips
the
flavor
is
completely
different
it
never
looped
or
repeated
its
just
been
a
journey
from
first
sip
to
last
in
this
way
piraat
is
like
a
movie
where
many
other
beers
are
more
like
a
tv
show
or
sitcom
maybe
its
more
like
a
freeform
jazz
odyssey
and
less
like
a
4
minute
repetitious
radio
song
regardless
i
love
it
and
the
15
or
so
posttax
is
totally
worth
it
given
that
you
have
the
time
to
tear
each
little
sensation
apart
at
and
analyze
each
one
on
a
clean
palate
otherwise
you
might
as
well
be
buying
a
museum
ticket
to
view
a
van
gogh
without
your
glasses
on
only
to
see
a
bunch
of
pretty
colors
d
one
of
the
better
belgies
but
not
the
best
would
have
another
if
you
offered
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pick
one
up
if
you
can
couldnt
pack
on
this
one
the
abv
and
the
yeast
will
keep
me
at
one
for
now
pours
a
very
nice
midcopper
color
with
fantastic
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
floral
hoppy
scent
though
its
hard
to
get
much
through
all
of
the
foam
very
nice
taste
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
hoppybitter
taste
followed
by
a
very
nice
belgian
spiciness
and
finishes
with
a
great
smooth
mixture
of
both
a
very
nice
beer
although
the
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
content
make
it
slightly
rough
12oz
bottle
as
part
of
gift
pack
from
lcbo
for
christmas
2007
best
before
of
may
2009
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
that
recedes
quickly
to
a
normal
film
allowed
to
warm
for
about
a
half
hour
strong
aroma
but
its
too
sweet
first
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
as
it
warmly
goes
down
the
throat
full
bodied
the
sweetness
continues
but
is
reasonably
kept
in
check
pretty
nice
strong
stuff
d
lets
get
ready
to
rumble
im
getting
more
this
week
for
sure
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
slight
apple
taste
after
the
finish
this
is
one
id
drink
again
though
im
definitely
going
to
check
out
the
others
in
the
style
first
got
a
chouffe
ipa
in
my
fridge
right
now
d
good
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
pours
a
pretty
clear
gold
with
a
small
to
medium
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
note
of
alcohol
there
are
some
herbal
hops
and
some
light
yeastiness
as
well
taste
is
quite
sweet
plenty
of
herbal
hops
provide
balance
lots
of
alcohol
warm
but
not
so
much
that
it
becomes
annoying
or
abrasive
some
phenolic
and
yeasty
notes
also
intense
but
also
fairly
balanced
and
very
good
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
dangerous
and
excellent
beer
great
name
as
well
i
have
been
considering
brewing
a
triple
for
some
time
now
but
after
tasting
this
i
think
i
would
love
to
brew
a
clone
of
this
if
soley
to
have
this
on
hand
and
hopefully
for
much
cheaper
than
2
cases
of
this
would
cost
considering
that
at
where
i
bought
this
set
a
single
330
ml
bottle
retails
for
close
to
4
dollars
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
the
carbonation
is
making
me
burp
a
lot
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
but
i
would
certainly
like
to
try
its
a
very
complex
beer
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
tripel
than
an
ipa
its
unique
and
in
my
opinion
definitely
worth
the
price
piraats
appearance
was
wonderful
a
bright
blonde
ale
which
smell
is
towards
the
sweet
side
the
taste
is
very
strong
similar
to
most
tripels
it
leaves
a
very
sweet
after
taste
it
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
great
with
a
nice
piece
of
steak
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
drinkability
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
its
cost
and
its
become
harder
to
find
it
is
my
favorite
beer
its
a
bit
strong
but
best
and
rich
enough
to
enjoy
anyway
taste
the
honey
with
a
crisp
flavour
bit
of
a
carbonation
bite
and
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
is
thick
in
the
mouth
but
not
at
all
smooth
the
carbonation
brings
with
it
a
heavy
bite
head
remains
for
a
long
period
as
i
clear
my
pallet
with
some
water
and
then
jet
away
to
attend
to
an
errand
impressive
retention
in
fact
this
has
to
stem
from
the
carbonation
i
belched
twice
while
drinking
it
despite
taking
my
time
drinkability
good
depsite
high
abv
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
highoctane
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
or
at
least
until
the
abv
catches
up
with
you
eric
afterthought
as
expected
when
the
yeast
is
swirled
in
the
alcohol
bite
gets
its
sharp
corners
shaved
off
and
the
mouthfeel
becomes
decidedly
creamier
also
noticeable
is
a
more
baked
character
to
the
malts
and
a
more
tart
finish
that
works
well
with
the
hops
note
this
was
part
of
the
global
beer
network
6
living
flanders
ales
6pack
expensive
but
an
awesome
opportunity
more
brewers
should
do
this
overall
this
is
fabulous
not
as
hoppy
as
other
belgian
ipas
houblon

just
as
tasty
went
very

can
get
you
all
these
stubby
belgian
tasted
beers
at
the
wine
exchange
and
gives
you
a
starter
kit
to
make
a
stubby
belgian
invite
of
your
own
oversized
wine
glass
and
snifter
not
included
form
your
own
opinion
though
dont
copy
mine
part
of
the
reason
for
this
invite
was
to
serve
as
a
countdown
to
my
birthday
so
send
me
good
wishes
good
night
everyone
pours
the
first
half
with
good
clarity
a
light
amber
color
with
a
solid
half
inch
of
big
bubbled
head
the
aromas
contain
a
fair
amount
of
belgian
character
light
on
the
phenolics
more
a
citrus
brightness
the
hops
in
this
one
arent
particularly
strong
in
the
aroma
just
notes
of
pine
and
a
light
floral
spiciness
on
the
palate
things
seem
really
out
of
balance
sort
of
wacky
i
get
a
nice
light
crackery
malt
flavor
combined
with
some
more
nondescript
hops
light
yeasty
character
but
its
the
lower
than
usual
carbonation
combined
with
a
biggish
body
that
hurt
this
beer
the
finish
certainly
has
some
hop
bitterness
to
it
this
is
just
a
really
difficult
style
to
pull
off
i
feel
and
piraat
comes
up
a
bit
short
d
not
too
bad
but
not
what
i
was
looking
for
or
expecting
when
i
read
triple
ipa
d
too
drinkable
for
such
potent
stuff
im
the
captain
of
this
ship
and
i
have
responsibilities
but
eh
they
might
get
neglected
now
after
i
spent
damn
near
a
pint
and
a
half
trying
to
decipher
this
bitch
boozed
sure
stumbley
not
yet
blown
away
no
but
still
quite
impressed
i
envisioned
like
a
black
tan
of
sorts
equal
amounts
mixed
of
tripel
and
american
ipa
but
instead
met
with
what
seemed
like
a
decently
hoppy
tripel
now
i
know
what
to
expect
from
a
bipa
and
would
like
to
further
explore
the
style
drinkability
very
tasty
and
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
i
expected
a
much
bigger
american
hop
character
and
while
i
didnt
find
the
big
hops
i
was
looking
for
i
was
pleased
with
what
i
did
fine
a
nice
big
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
hop
character
i
am
interested
to
try
more
of
these
belgian
ipas
finish
is
herbal
dry
and
pleasantly
chalky
tastes
like
citrus
and
yeast
with
a
bit
of
bananas
not
much
carbonation
many
fond
memories
of
this
brew
notes
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
is
similar
to
their
augustijn
ale
but
with
a
higher
alcohol
presence
i
am
about
80
done
drinking
this
330ml
bottle
and
i
can
feel
it
not
a
beer
that
you
will
drink
too
much
of
especially
for
the
4
price
but
it
is
worth
every
penny
imo
nearly
as
good
or
possibly
better
than
duvel
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
with
hints
of
fruits
some
spices
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
bitter
but
with
a
nice
splash
of
fruits
and
spices
the
alcohol
comes
out
fairly
well
but
it
doesnt
harm
the
beer
the
complexity
to
this
beer
is
surprising
because
the
hops
are
initially
very
present
but
the
subtle
spices
and
fruits
are
great
the
mouth
feels
is
nice
and
creamy
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
many
of
these
because
of
the
spices
but
that
is
usually
how
i
feel
on
belgian
beer
despite
the
abv
easier
to
drink
than
one
can
imagine
the
taster
allows
the
boldness
to
emerge
more
though
it
is
very
smooth
and
complex
there
is
lots
of
banana
berry
and
apple
very
rich
really
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
really
fine
while
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
it
doesnt
veer
into
the
sodalike
texture
that
can
go
overboard
for
some
belgians
this
is
just
right
and
easy
to
down
the
alcohol
thankfully
catches
up
just
after
it
finishes
a
good
hot
flash
as
a
reminder
of
what
a
delicious
beverage
that
was
very
good
stuff
bronzed
apricot
hues
thick
frothy
head
nose
is
sweet
crunchy
honey
as
are
the
dominant
notes
in
the
mouth
the
sweetness
is
complicated
with
subtle
malt
flavor
and
mild
spices
but
the
overall
effect
is
one
of
balance
despite
the
alcohol
the
brew
is
softly
spritzy
which
works
a
nice
style
tripel
thats
easy
to
find
and
enjoy
highly
carbonated
slightly
crisp
and
somewhat
refreshing
yet
another
delicious
belgian
brew
this
ones
got
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
so
sipping
would
be
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
going
belgian
brew
in
aroma
and
taste
but
heavy
in
alcohol
and
co2
regardless
this
is
a
nicely
proportioned
brew
that
remains
light
on
the
palate
cheers
d
not
terrible
but
it
took
me
a
bit
to
finish
it
alcohol
holds
this
back
quite
a
bit
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
a
patch
on
me
eye
and
a
dead
parrot
on
me
shoulder
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
ridiculous
4
inch
thick
head
that
me
dead
parrot
was
actually
able
to
sit
on
after
20
minutes
of
starin
at
that
head
with
me
one
good
eye
i
decided
she
wasnt
goin
nowhere
so
i
better
get
to
drinkin
the
taste
was
dry
and
way
too
sweet
almost
like
drinking
a
wine
warm
alcohol
finish
with
a
sticky
sweet
mouthcoat
way
too
sweet
for
a
beer
id
rather
walk
the
plank
than
drink
this
swill
again
shiver
me
timbers
this
shit
sucked
d
definitely
heavy
on
the
drinkability
could
use
a
few
more
of
these
right
now
d
drinkability
is
good
the
high
abv
is
hidden
well
and
makes
this
one
go
down
that
much
easier
i
was
expecting
more
hops
in
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
in
the
way
the
hops
were
balanced
with
other
flavors
definitely
a
recommeded
beer
so
bomb
so
bomb
so
bomb
so
bomb
this
beer
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
so
bomb
its
sipping
material
though
can
easily
be
drunk
in
a
gulp
with
its
bomb
tastes
sizzlin
your
tastebuds
if
i
had
one
a
day
id
live
to
see
92
give
thanks
and
praise
for
this
bomb
did
i
say
bomb
chronic
belgian
brew
okay
brew
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
of
tropical
fruit
heavy
spices
and
rich
bitterness
white
pepper
as
it
warms
the
spices
become
stronger
and
the
overall
flavor
becomes
more
bitter
visions
of
being
a
pirate
steeling
ones
courage
with
this
strong
ale
cant
help
but
leap
to
mind
whilst
partaking
of
this
brew
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
one
of
the
most
unique
and
complex
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
it
pours
golden
and
creamy
with
a
gorgeous
head
the
taste
is
nearly
indescribable
and
packs
a
serious
punch
it
has
a
strong
yeasty
flavor
with
earthy
spicy
notes
as
well
as
creamy
fruit
tones
it
has
a
strong
phenol
character
which
normally
i
dont
care
for
but
it
lends
a
bold
sharpness
to
this
beer
which
i
found
very
alluring
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
warmth
to
it
which
im
sure
is
related
to
the
high
abv
while
drinking
too
many
glasses
could
be
dangerous
i
really
enjoyed
this
flavorful
beer
the
pour
on
this
beer
was
a
gold
color
with
a
white
one
finger
head
citrus
and
honey
were
the
only
apparent
aromas
that
i
could
pick
up
on
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
hops
in
the
mix
it
was
an
easy
big
beer
for
me
to
drink
it
was
refreshing
with
a
little
carbonated
bite
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
before
the
yeast
pour
with
a
massive
snowwhite
head
that
leaps
out
of
the
glass
just
to
let
you
know
its
belgian
the
typical
stubborn
head
that
comes
with
the
style
is
here
one
that
forces
you
to
wait
and
admire
the
rocky
billows
of
foam
that
slowly
sink
to
reveal
magnificent
spiderweb
lacing
and
active
carbonation
the
high
carbonation
releases
effervescent
aromas
of
candysugar
slightly
buiscuity
pils
malt
and
mild
saaz
hops
the
nose
seems
much
more
subdued
than
appropriate
and
pales
in
comparison
to
the
appearance
or
taste
first
sip
is
light
beet
sugar
and
sharp
pils
some
faint
toasted
notes
and
trappist
phenols
similiar
to
tripel
become
more
obvious
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
character
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
bitterness
there
is
little
to
no
hop
flavor
aside
from
a
background
spicy
saaz
and
mabye
a
hint
of
floral
hallertau
but
even
the
bitterness
is
lacking
to
balance
the
syrupy
sweet
malt
and
sugar
of
course
this
style
is
open
to
interpretation
but
piraat
is
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
has
very
litle
hop
presenceand
yes
i
am
drinking
the
ipa
piraat
the
medium
body
is
made
ultra
light
due
to
the
knifelike
carbonation
that
also
whisks
away
some
of
the
residual
sweetness
but
further
masks
the
timid
noble
hop
character
finishes
sweet
with
mellow
yet
tart
phenols
a
bland
and
flat
bitterness
and
rosey
alcohol
notes
as
it
warms
the
phenols
are
interesting
but
other
than
that
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
simple
beer
and
poor
example
of
the
style
this
would
score
better
as
a
hoppy
bsga
poured
an
almost
champagne
like
colour
into
a
chalice
very
little
head
to
speak
of
but
plenty
of
carbonation
noticed
plenty
of
yeast
chunks
got
through
will
have
to
learn
to
decant
better
very
tropical
floral
smell
lots
of
citrus
bananas
and
dry
grass
and
earth
sweet
and
spicy
taste
lots
of
fruits
and
malts
with
some
pepper
cardamon
warming
alcohol
and
i
swear
i
tasted
paprika
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
harsh
overly
carbonated
almost
burning
sensation
a
decent
beer
that
needs
improvement
d
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
highly
enjoyable
d
as
this
mama
warms
she
gets
good
good
good
i
improved
the
marks
above
a
couple
of
times
because
of
this
very
strong
yes
but
like
ive
said
before
men
drink
strong
brews
and
men
would
be
just
fine
with
a
jar
of
this
in
front
of
all
of
ye
night
definitely
wear
this
it
fits
so
nicely
she
will
fit
you
like
two
latex
mittens
yes
drinkability
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
it
was
alright
drank
at
a
house
warming
party
no
glasses
to
pour
it
in
yet
rather
rich
and
warm
in
flavour
nice
mixture
of
carbonation
and
hops
up
front
but
not
overpowering
a
little
sweet
but
once
again
a
good
balance
and
not
overpowering
no
distinct
alcohol
flavour
despite
its
high
percentage
as
it
got
warm
the
quality
decreased
d
this
is
rated
lower
due
to
the
really
big
abv
drank
one
and
realized
i
probably
would
not
be
able
to
have
another
after
letting
the
beer
warm
up
a
bit
and
getting
past
the
10
5
alcohol
taste
it
really
starts
to
open
up
deep
flavors
of
malt
light
dancing
of
carbonation
a
really
fine
drink
if
i
were
a
pirate
i
assume
this
would
be
my
beer
tropical
and
boozy
enough
to
cure
the
pain
in
my
pegleg
i
havent
had
too
many
forays
into
the
10
5
range
yet
alcohol
im
not
knocking
this
beer
at
allits
goodit
just
reminds
me
of
the
maltliquor
kick
experienced
as
an
18yearold
im
feeling
pleasant
and
warm
after
one
of
these
if
10
5
can
be
drinkable
i
guess
this
has
good
drinkability
proceed
with
caution
now
this
was
to
be
my
first
of
the
style
which
i
thought
a
belgian
ipa
not
a
bspa
maybe
it
is
mislabeled
as
a
bspa
it
is
unspectacular
it
isnt
overly
complex
but
is
heavy
malty
spicy
and
alcoholic
which
probably
ranks
it
as
one
of
the
best
pirate
grogs
available
yargh
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
my
bottle
says
10
5
abv
my
cheeks
are
already
feeling
warm
i
always
like
to
try
a
bottle
or
two
a
year
just
to
get
reacquainted
to
an
old
friend
ive
enjoyed
for
many
years
i
even
have
the
tshirt
very
creamy
finish
it
does
mask
the
high
abv
nicely
i
just
must
have
had
a
bad
bottle
or
this
stuff
just
smells
d
abv
definitely
causes
a
hit
here
this
certainly
is
not
an
anytime
brew
however
it
is
a
wonderfully
complex
yet
balanced
sipper
given
its
name
i
never
would
have
expected
something
so
refined
find
this
one
and
try
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
if
anything
i
have
been
harsh
with
this
beer
as
i
was
close
to
giving
it
a
4
5
for
taste
quite
delicious
evilly
drinkable
with
no
off
flavours
not
one
i
had
heard
of
before
but
still
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tried
however
pricy
11
50
per
330ml
bottle
recommended
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
rich
i
didnt
notice
any
alcohol
burn
but
i
definitely
felt
the
warmth
drinkability
is
very
good
none
of
the
tastes
are
so
strong
as
to
become
annoying
over
a
long
haul
the
long
haul
here
is
two
based
on
the
abv
but
i
would
enjoy
every
sip
of
those
two
a
nice
beer
golden
brown
in
color
fruity
citrus
and
floral
and
yeasty
on
the
nose
with
corresponding
flavors
subtle
hops
on
the
finish
hops
develops
over
time
with
reminants
of
typical
belgian
yeast
not
a
trace
of
the
alcohol
well
brewed
great
belgian
for
beginners
to
try
and
beer
drinkers
will
enjoy
its
nuances
and
lasting
flavor
overall
a
truely
stellar
brew
one
that
is
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
american
extreme
beer
drinker
that
is
trying
to
cross
over
to
belgians
this
was
poured
from
a
small
11
2
oz
bottle
gorgeous
head
beautiful
golden
body
lots
of
lacing
arond
the
goblet
big
smells
of
grass
yeastwheats
wonderful
wild
things
these
belgian
brews
are
like
sitting
in
a
field
taste
is
quite
complex
sweet
malts
wheats
citrus
grapefruit
thick
sugary
mouthfeel
very
thick
and
sticky
on
the
palate
slight
alcohol
burn
deep
in
the
throat
drinkability
for
me
is
very
slow
simply
because
this
is
a
very
nice
and
complex
brew
i
cant
drink
quickly
because
it
will
all
be
gone
imagine
a
hogaarden
x12
and
this
is
it
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
and
received
a
small
head
that
left
constant
lacings
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
w
a
amber
golden
appearance
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
yeasty
w
a
tart
citrus
smell
picked
up
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
need
to
try
again
with
more
beer
experience
because
the
taste
is
one
of
sour
applespearscherries
or
kriekpineapples
basically
a
more
acidic
not
smooth
fruit
not
an
orange
bananna
strawberry
i
also
picked
up
some
of
the
hops
w
the
high
abv
but
there
is
also
a
dry
backbite
due
to
some
pepper
or
spices
this
isnt
like
most
ipas
that
heat
upexhaust
your
taste
buds
this
has
a
smooth
tasty
flow
over
your
tongue
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
as
the
one
i
had
has
already
made
my
night
from
a
short
fat
stout
11
2
oz
bottle
that
came
as
part
of
a
living
beers
of
the
world
gift
set
from
garys
in
madison
pours
a
yellowgolden
color
with
minimal
head
that
soon
dissapated
smell
is
full
of
fruits
esters
and
bananas
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
full
of
citrus
fruits
bananas
esters
alcohol
and
yeast
a
hefty
10
5
abv
is
certainly
noticeable
the
beer
has
a
champagne
whitewine
characteristic
thanks
to
its
strong
alcohol
percentage
very
powerful
and
dominating
brew
although
considered
a
belgian
ipa
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
belgian
strong
ale
an
interesting
brew
with
a
pirate
on
the
sticker
of
the
bottle
recommended
as
an
interesting
depiction
of
the
style
hardtofind
worth
a
try
pour
the
sediment
in
and
you
get
a
darker
cloudier
brew
that
is
slightly
sweeter
overall
very
enjoyable
unfortunately
a
bit
expensive
where
i
live
but
its
worth
the
extra
dough
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
it
fills
the
glass
about
halfway
with
a
cloudy
melonamber
color
there
is
about
14
inch
of
head
that
was
produced
by
a
relatively
easy
pour
it
slowly
begins
to
fade
as
it
sets
and
it
turns
into
blotchy
swirls
it
smells
like
strong
sweet
malts
grassy
hops
and
candi
sugar
this
smells
a
lot
like
st
bernardus
watou
tripel
there
is
a
creamy
aspect
to
the
smell
that
i
think
is
produced
by
a
very
delicate
balance
of
the
malt
used
and
the
yeast
i
like
the
flavor
quite
a
bit
it
is
strong
and
sweet
the
alcohol
provides
undertones
of
tart
fruits
that
give
it
a
sweet
white
wine
dimension
the
maltiness
provides
a
strong
base
for
the
slightly
bitter
and
grassy
hops
to
build
a
bridge
to
the
fruity
alcohol
this
is
a
well
made
and
extremely
well
balanced
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
but
i
enjoy
the
level
of
fusel
alcohol
present
its
a
kid
reminder
that
this
beer
will
kick
your
ass
if
your
arent
careful
very
good
beer
i
really
like
the
spicy
hop
aftertaste
it
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
other
pale
belgian
ales
i
have
had
tastes
of
sweet
fruits
pale
malt
has
a
very
noticeable
and
warming
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
sipper
d
i
love
this
beer
in
this
style
this
beer
is
excelent
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
recent
memory
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
very
nice
time
of
year
truely
magnificent
pours
a
bright
and
clear
medium
gold
with
a
massive
rocky
head
that
lasts
very
well
and
leaves
spectacular
lacing
smell
is
bold
and
hoppy
the
alcohol
showing
slightly
as
well
spicy
cloves
and
pepper
in
the
mix
alongside
the
citrus
and
crackers
taste
is
strong
and
upfront
big
hop
bitterness
is
obvious
but
theres
more
here
as
well
spices
and
banana
light
yeastiness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
sweetness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
love
it
its
raw
and
ballsy
with
loads
of
character
body
is
full
and
a
bit
creamy
with
only
a
touch
of
stickiness
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
very
warming
while
this
isnt
the
easiestdrinking
beer
around
it
is
quite
pleasant
for
slowly
sipping
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
overall
just
an
excellent
ipa
overall
although
it
is
a
fair
bit
sweeter
than
other
ipas
i
have
tried
suggesting
it
probably
should
be
in
a
different
category
probably
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
personally
prefer
unibroue
maudite
which
is
a
dark
ale
but
tastes
fairly
similar
to
piraat
d
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
finely
brewed
belgian
pale
ale
its
incredibly
crisp
and
refreshing
and
delightfully
smooth
to
drink
despite
the
9
abv
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
very
well
crafted
with
elegantly
balanced
flavours
its
well
hidden
9
abv
makes
this
one
highly
drinkable

so
be
careful
i
cant
wait
till
my
next
one
nothing
exceptional
fights
the
alcohol
in
this
ale
the
alcohol
is
overpowering
with
no
reward
minus
the
obvious
d
one
day
is
plenty
but
one
everyday
would
be
fine
with
me
hazy
gold
with
large
thick
head
aggressive
aromas
of
honey
floralcitrus
like
a
tropical
flower
or
fruit
honeysuckle
pineapple
bread
dough
yeast
funk
and
alcohol
but
somehow
it
worked
perfectly
very
tasty
as
well
definitely
a
big
beer
but
it
justifies
its
punch
with
a
delicious
mix
of
flavors
further
research
is
required
and
i
will
be
trying
this
again
soon
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
its
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
even
as
it
warms
up
i
think
this
is
now
one
of
my
preferred
relaxation
beers
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
d
i
didnt
like
this
beer
nearly
as
much
as
i
previously
have
could
have
drank
at
least
three
or
four
more
of
these
small
10
ounce
pours
looking
forward
to
trying
the
triple
ipa
by
piraat
next
had
this
beer
twice
now
once
in
bottle
and
on
tap
and
the
draft
really
shows
why
it
is
a
great
belgian
tastes
much
smoother
and
does
not
disappoint
yarr
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
years
ago
the
bar
tender
said
to
me
15
minutes
before
last
call
you
want
to
end
your
night
with
this
he
gave
a
piraat
and
there
havent
been
any
truer
words
the
carbonation
is
incredible
not
overdone
persistent
and
yet
not
overpowering
pours
to
a
hazy
orange
with
not
much
head
nose
is
very
subtle
but
still
present
no
big
surprise
on
taste
its
a
very
typical
belgian
light
carbonation
seems
appropriate
the
biggest
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
it
is
very
easy
to
find
in
the
flavor
of
each
drink
and
at
10
5
it
finds
you
quickly
too
personally
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
hidden
in
theother
flavors
of
the
beer
still
an
excellent
choice
when
looking
for
something
to
relax
with
and
sip
on
d
this
is
imo
nothing
other
than
a
good
bspa
why
is
it
listed
as
a
belgian
ipa
and
called
an
amber
triple
ipa
under
the
title
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
that
reminds
me
of
the
interesting
atomium
that
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
in
that
its
main
flavor
component
seems
to
be
honey
and
sweet
summer
fruits
although
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
its
a
really
nice
and
boozy
but
still
fresh
and
breezy
belgian
golden
brown
in
color
fruity
citrus
and
floral
and
yeasty
on
the
nose
with
corresponding
flavors
subtle
hops
on
the
finish
hops
develops
over
time
with
reminants
of
typical
belgian
yeast
not
a
trace
of
the
alcohol
well
brewed
great
belgian
for
beginners
to
try
and
beer
drinkers
will
enjoy
its
nuances
and
lasting
flavor
its
a
decent
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
but
its
just
a
bit
too
boozy
and
it
doesnt
really
fit
well
with
the
other
flavors
im
glad
i
had
a
friend
to
share
this
bottle
with
if
you
see
a
bottle
of
this
around
somewhere
its
a
musttry
at
least
once
they
also
make
a
nifty
tulip
glass
for
it
that
has
the
piraat
logo
screened
on
the
side
drinkability
even
at
10
5
ive
downed
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
before
during
a
bucs
game
not
the
best
decision
in
the
world
and
i
was
feeling
it
at
the
end
but
boy
did
it
make
losing
the
game
easier
to
bear
i
dont
know
about
the
ipa
part
but
it
was
still
a
good
strong
pale
belgian
there
was
a
rich
bread
dough
and
fruit
malt
flavor
similar
to
a
paler
barleywine
or
dipa
he
malt
was
followed
up
by
some
yeasty
sweetness
and
funky
yet
tropical
hops
its
tasty
and
different
gotta
love
that
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
very
tasty
too
such
a
good
beer
overall
i
recommend
the
beer
and
would
try
it
again
maybe
after
some
cellaring
my
only
criticism
was
that
i
would
liked
more
hops
which
is
true
of
almost
every
beer
that
crosses
my
lips
im
really
intrigued
by
this
style
i
think
its
a
great
match
piraat
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
gold
with
a
beautiful
creamy
frothy
head
that
lingers
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dry
slightly
funky
yeast
i
could
mistake
this
for
a
hoppy
saison
there
is
a
nice
subtley
fragrant
piney
aroma
like
chinook
hops
but
soft
not
rough
at
all
the
flavor
is
mostly
like
a
triple
its
sweet
upfront
with
a
slightly
chalky
dry
yeast
flavor
it
is
slightly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
hop
flavor
but
toned
done
compared
to
the
aroma
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
apparent
even
after
it
warms
i
will
have
to
look
into
more
beers
of
this
style
because
although
this
one
is
delicious
its
fairly
expensive
will
most
assuredly
be
drinking
this
beer
more
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
hot
and
yet
airy
active
carbonation
keeps
it
feeling
crisp
and
light
the
abv
and
the
somewhat
hot
feel
to
it
kept
me
from
having
another
on
this
day
i
would
have
it
again
but
probably
only
one
at
a
time
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
fizzy
i
would
have
given
a
higher
drinkability
but
i
woke
up
the
next
day
with
a
killer
headache
i
walked
the
plank
on
this
one
a
nice
wellbalanced
spicy
sweet
tasty
belgian
ipa
here
quite
drinkable
for
abv
level
though
glad
i
shared
it
with
someone
a
unique
beer
that
i
will
probably
pick
up
again
interesting
flavors
mix
with
big
alcohol
that
adds
more
interesting
flavors
another
quality
belgian
brew
dnow
this
is
one
dangerous
brew
that
i
wish
i
got
in
a
larger
size
than
this
stubby
this
is
basically
a
tripel
with
a
huge
dose
of
bittering
hops
the
almost
honey
like
sweetness
plays
so
well
off
of
the
bitter
hop
background
and
then
at
the
end
you
get
this
dose
of
spice
magnificent
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
a
quintessential
example
of
a
fine
belgian
ales
sometimes
piraat
tastes
more
funky
to
me
other
bottles
some
fruitier
but
its
always
wonderful
van
steenberge
forever
has
my
highest
respect
for
creating
two
worldclass
beers
this
and
the
phenomenal
gulden
draak
the
beer
pours
an
impressive
solid
gold
color
with
pretty
good
lacing
and
head
retention
there
isnt
a
huge
amount
of
foam
but
what
there
is
lasts
and
lasts
the
beer
has
a
sweet
honey
aroma
on
the
nose
but
with
some
underlying
spice
and
white
pepper
very
intriguing
the
beer
is
just
excellent
on
the
palate
with
flavors
of
honey
butter
and
white
pepper
the
beer
is
not
the
least
bit
heavy
and
has
a
crispness
i
really
appreciate
it
it
finishes
just
a
bit
drybitter
from
the
hops
and
is
quite
refreshing
although
you
know
the
abv
is
up
there
this
beer
is
surprising
easy
to
drink
really
one
would
never
guess
the
abv
is
10
5
just
an
altogether
excellent
beer
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
massive
head
that
threatened
to
spill
all
over
the
floor
this
is
one
lively
brew
aroma
was
very
fruity
and
floral
with
some
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
taste
was
incredibly
sweet
and
syrupy
with
some
notes
of
citrus
and
peppery
spices
to
go
along
with
it
alcohol
was
quite
evident
up
front
and
in
the
finish
but
i
didnt
mind
too
much
after
half
the
bottle
was
gone
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
the
palate
the
very
high
level
of
sweetness
paired
with
the
strong
alcoholic
notes
hurt
the
drinkability
for
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
that
would
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
complex
drinkability
i
have
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
tried
to
have
that
not
effect
my
review
i
can
see
the
attraction
for
this
offering
and
it
does
represent
the
belgian
ipa
style
very
well
however
my
leanings
are
toward
the
chouffe
or
ranke
offerings
solid
drinkability
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
but
even
if
it
did
not
i
find
this
to
be
only
a
decent
beer
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
often
poured
into
a
piraat
tulip
pours
a
rich
golden
orange
with
a
white
super
frothy
rocky
head
that
sits
there
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
sugar
and
fruit
that
taste
mimics
it
not
a
lot
of
hops
detected
but
some
earthiness
mostly
sweetwess
in
the
form
of
sugar
and
fruit
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
a
very
nice
strong
belgian
pale
ale
this
beer
is
an
odd
one
and
certainly
worth
a
try
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
remind
me
of
playing
in
apple
orchards
in
sebastopol
ca
when
i
was
a
kid
plenty
of
brown
apples
on
the
ground
drinkabilty
i
am
hammmered
served
in
my
westmalle
glass
while
i
watch
the
brewers
come
back
and
defeat
the
braves
id
have
to
say
life
is
pretty
good
belgian
ale
creation
looked
clear
and
yellow
as
it
poured
from
the
bottle
but
was
a
darker
orangish
almost
tan
color
in
the
glass
looked
like
an
ipa
no
hops
in
the
nose
though
the
only
smell
was
sweet
alcohol
the
taste
is
buttery
and
yeasty
but
no
malt
flavors
and
almost
no
hops
at
all
certainly
doesnt
fit
my
idea
of
an
ipa
more
like
a
belgian
tripel
this
is
one
of
the
great
beers
that
i
can
never
get
sick
of
ever
it
is
light
in
color
a
dry
finish
with
a
huge
alcohol
presence
it
is
listed
as
10
5
but
after
talking
to
jef
versale
of
van
steenberge
it
ranges
between
9
to
14
so
it
is
always
a
surprise
where
it
might
take
you
plus
after
a
piraat
everything
gets
better
praat
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
huge
head

and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
sourness
the
taste
is
fruity
and
spicy
mixed
with
hops
and
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
while
drinking
at
a
warmer
temperature
helps
the
flavors
do
not
seem
to
blend
well
and
therefore
does
not
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
d
this
isnt
the
most
drinkable
beer
because
of
all
the
alcohol
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
after
dinner
sipper
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
though
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
chewy
and
warming
this
beer
would
be
ideal
with
pork
knuckle
enough
spirit
fruit
to
cut
through
the
fat
and
hold
its
own
looks
good
and
drinkable
aroma
has
strong
fruity
overtones
making
it
smell
almost
like
a
cider
rather
than
an
ale
taste
is
strongly
fruity
as
well
as
malty
with
quite
a
bite
of
bitter
i
had
a
rather
small
bottle
but
it
was
all
i
needed
to
sample
this
brew
and
rate
it
a
nice
jazzy
ale
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
a
touch
sweet
but
that
balances
the
alcohol
fairly
well
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
but
enjoyable
dont
really
get
any
ipa
out
of
this
so
it
loses
tastearoma
points
for
that
served
in
a
small
bottle
the
pour
was
a
nice
creamy
golden
color
there
was
a
slight
foam
on
top
more
than
i
am
used
to
in
belgian
beers
this
is
the
first
belgian
ipa
that
i
have
tried
and
enjoyed
it
it
seemed
very
similar
to
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
extra
something
hops
it
has
a
crisp
strong
taste
that
was
flavorful
it
was
enjoyable
but
the
strong
bite
never
calmed
down
so
it
may
become
overwhelming
if
i
had
too
much
certainly
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
for
the
belgian
ale
aficionado
but
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
unless
a
friend
wants
to
try
it
too
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
intense
slightly
unbalanced
and
not
entirely
to
my
liking
for
me
its
merely
a
novelty
d

very
drinkable
and
little
trace
of
the
10
5
abv
in
the
taste
recommended
overall
a
good
belgian
ipa
but
id
rather
have
a
hoblen
chouffe
triple
ipa
instead
which
is
a
better
example
of
the
style
imo
this
beer
pours
a
golden
colour
with
a
large
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
of
spiced
yeast
and
fresh
fruit
alcohol
is
dominant
in
the
taste
esters
are
also
present
as
well
as
a
hint
of
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
too
aggresive
for
me
far
too
gassy
making
this
beer
undrinkable
for
me
drinkability
slightly
disappointing
unfortunately
i
was
surprised
by
the
relative
lack
of
hops
character
and
the
overwhelming
cideryness
alcohol
too
high
and
flavor
not
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
much
at
a
time
really
gentle
pour
didnt
yield
much
head
spotty
lacing
that
isnt
much
to
write
about
the
color
is
a
hazy
straw
yellow
first
sip
is
extreme
being
over
10
abv
damn
it
hits
you
but
isnt
that
bad
after
a
few
more
the
aroma
is
very
different
not
just
for
an
ipa
but
for
any
beer
ive
ever
smelt
it
has
a
candylike
banana
smell
like
a
wheat
beer
hops
are
tasted
on
the
finish
for
just
a
second
it
leaves
a
shortlived
bitterness
very
good
belgian
ipa
but
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
any
given
sitting
this
would
be
good
after
a
nice
dinner
with
a
cigar
nicely
carbonated
with
balanced
body
the
high
abv
makes
swallowing
difficult
very
different
from
the
ipas
i
drink
mouthfeel
is
sugary
sweet
up
front
moderately
smooth
along
with
a
dose
of
pepper
and
coriander
with
a
bitterness
that
touches
the
back
of
the
tongue
on
the
swallow
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
that
left
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
belgian
candi
sugar
spice
a
bit
of
pepper
and
corriander
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
in
the
taste
department
starts
off
sweet
and
spicy
followed
by
alcohol
and
ending
with
dry
hops
the
feel
is
tightly
carbonated
moderate
body
a
bit
bitterdry
a
very
unique
brew
it
has
some
boldness
to
it
but
balances
in
the
end
the
noticable
alcohol
feel
would
limit
me
to
a
few
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
a
very
interesting
experiance
i
find
im
starting
to
like
belgian
ales
a
lot
wow
love
the
pairing
of
belgian
yeast
and
ipa
style
sweet
spicy
yeast
character
works
wonders
on
the
slightly
resinous
and
piney
hop
profile
the
brew
works
on
so
many
levels
just
when
you
think
its
a
fruity
belgian
it
comes
back
with
the
slick
and
powerful
ipa
hops
and
malt
alcohol
is
apparent
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
factor
ends
sticky
fruity
with
great
hops
perfect
with
a
plate
of
frittes
and
spicy
mayo
after
seeing
this
brew
for
years
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
the
bottle
that
i
had
or
what
but
i
think
that
this
was
a
very
tough
drink
just
did
not
set
right
with
me
for
some
reason
it
was
poured
to
a
somewhat
hazy
colored
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
hard
that
broke
down
quite
quickly
bur
did
leave
a
trace
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aromas
seemed
to
be
complex
which
really
intrigued
me
had
fruit
like
lemon
spices
and
a
sweet
property
so
with
the
aroma
i
was
really
thinking
that
this
was
going
to
be
one
of
my
great
beers
but
the
taste
seemed
to
hold
something
that
was
very
tough
to
take
in
upfront
the
taste
was
good
with
a
sweet
property
and
some
spices
piping
through
but
then
at
the
tail
end
i
got
this
rough
taste
that
i
would
imagine
would
be
a
mix
hop
and
alcohol
that
was
tough
to
finish
from
the
way
it
looks
i
am
in
the
minority
here
but
i
felt
that
this
brew
was
extremely
tough
to
drink
and
overall
not
very
good
again
it
i
am
in
the
minority
here
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
will
i
try
it
again
yeah
will
do
that
because
this
review
is
based
on
a
single
experience
will
update
the
review
if
i
have
a
different
perspective
from
a
stubby
bottle
the
pour
yields
a
hazy
honeycolored
ale
with
a
threefinger
sudsy
top
tiny
streaming
bubbles
of
carbonation
are
present
the
smell
is
super
breadyyeastysort
of
like
the
smell
you
get
when
cutting
into
a
fresh
loaf
of
sourdough
with
a
hint
of
honeysuckle
and
malty
sweetness
taste
is
also
yeasty
with
some
estery
qualities
and
a
bit
boozy
too
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
and
detectable
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
grainy
with
good
carbonation
and
a
fuller
body
piraat
is
always
easy
to
drink
and
perhaps
too
easy
because
the
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
and
before
you
know
it
youre
three
sheets
gone
make
sure
youre
safe
at
home
if
you
plan
on
putting
a
few
of
these
down
taste
follows
up
the
promise
of
the
smell
some
soft
fruity
sweetness
up
front
with
solid
hoppy
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
lingering
floral
tangy
bitterness
hangs
on
for
a
while
really
quite
well
done
improves
and
balances
out
with
some
time
warming
in
the
glassthe
first
swallows
while
cold
were
a
bit
harsh
sour
and
too
bitter
give
it
time
and
the
components
meld
well
a
somewhat
challenging
brew
yet
continually
interesting
you
keep
wanting
to
drink
more
to
see
what
the
next
sip
will
taste
like
the
high
abv
integrates
well
the
strong
hops
hide
the
alcohol
be
careful
the
idea
of
a
belgian
ipa
is
like
a
dream
come
true
for
me
after
trying
offshores
divine
hop
goddess
and
many
bottles
of
chouffes
ipa
tripel
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
shot
each
of
these
gems
represent
a
unique
take
on
a
neophyte
hybrid
style
and
all
should
be
highly
sought
after
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
with
an
immense
sparkling
white
very
dense
head
smell
is
not
too
intense
but
is
of
belgian
sugars
and
slightly
of
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
belgian
sugars
transitions
to
a
light
hoppy
taste
with
a
slightly
alcoholic
dry
finish
i
have
to
say
though
i
would
never
guess
that
there
is
10
5
present
well
covered
beer
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
tons
of
tongue
stinging
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
with
the
abv
watch
out
definitely
a
must
try
pours
a
crystal
ckear
gold
color
with
a
huge
bright
white
champaign
like
head
that
recedes
quite
quickly
although
does
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
towards
the
bottom
smells
of
sugary
malts
a
hint
of
citrus
coriander
and
a
nice
smell
of
hops
that
seems
to
hold
all
the
scents
together
wow
lots
of
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
starts
off
with
a
sugary
bubblegum
malt
flavor
that
quickly
leads
way
to
a
surprisingly
bitter
hop
taste
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
quite
nicely
and
finishes
with
a
nice
warm
buttery
malt
flavor
that
lets
the
alcohol
give
its
kick
sips
nicely
as
its
carbonated
a
bit
high
but
it
seems
just
right
for
this
beer
and
isnt
overly
watery
or
oily
overall
im
diggin
it
and
glad
i
picked
it
up
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
on
a
weekend
night
and
relax
with
mouthfeel
was
very
solid
and
certainly
fullbodied
i
was
pleased
overall
with
this
one
i
could
possibly
buy
this
again
purchased
in
the
van
steenburge
sampler
box
along
with
gulden
draak
and
four
other
brews
apart
from
the
creative
label
which
strangely
juxtaposes
a
17th18thcentury
caribbean
pirate
with
a
classic
viking
longboat
this
was
a
disappointing
brew
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
and
has
a
mildly
hoppy
flavor
you
can
also
sense
the
power
of
the
high
alcoholic
content
which
most
belgian
ambers
do
not
posses
still
it
does
not
overwhelmingly
surpass
other
belgian
ambers
or
ipas
in
my
opinion
to
warrant
the
costly
price
a
good
beer
nonetheless
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
unless
i
was
watching
a
pirateviking
marathon
on
the
history
channel
the
is
a
reasonably
good
belgian
ale
it
pours
a
bit
mily
bronze
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
thins
to
some
nice
lacing
and
a
crown
good
carbonation
too
the
smell
is
sweet
and
betrays
to
potent
10
5
abv
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
nice
balacne
of
hops
and
malts
with
some
definite
fruit
esters
a
well
balanced
and
it
bites
on
the
swallow
the
mouthfell
is
clean
and
crips
but
one
is
usually
my
limit
thank
you
flanders
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
in
this
one
i
like
this
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
five
in
this
package
poured
out
a
light
golden
color
opaque
with
a
strong
fluffy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
citrus
then
malt
followed
by
ginger
and
honey
the
taste
offers
lemon
zest
malt
fruity
esters
sharp
bitterness
and
finally
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
decent
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
if
youre
planning
on
making
a
night
out
of
one
beer
fairly
drinkable
especially
considering
the
huge
alcohol
content
alcohol
is
well
concealed
and
mostly
reveals
itself
as
a
slight
warming
sensation
could
be
sessionable
but
i
suspect
the
hangover
after
a
night
of
piraats
would
be
nasty
while
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
that
was
probably
enough
for
me
d
too
good
for
a
beer
with
this
abv
sweet
bottle
poured
a
deep
yellow
color
ale
with
a
huge
poured
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
intense
for
my
liking
with
some
good
malt
backbone
and
lots
of
sugar
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
subtle
burning
sensation
from
the
alcohol
body
is
slightly
below
average
with
too
much
filtration
and
alcohol
is
too
intense
yeast
is
quite
discreet
and
sweet
too
present
this
one
is
definitely
not
to
my
liking
drinkability
a
really
tasty
and
fairly
strong
belgian
strong
pale
ale
if
you
want
to
know
what
phenolic
esters
taste
like
try
this
one
on
for
size
but
seriously
this
is
a
great
beer
try
it
flavor
intensified
as
the
beer
warmed
and
more
components
came
through
a
bit
of
an
earthy
pine
oil
surfaced
with
toasted
nuts
and
more
sugar
i
could
definitely
taste
the
phenols
too
by
the
end
one
that
i
would
have
again
d
this
beer
is
smooth
that
starts
sweet
with
a
nice
alcohol
finish
this
would
be
a
great
desert
beer
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
was
a
good
drink
while
sitting
around
with
friends
after
work
one
of
few
beers
that
i
consider
not
having
another
not
because
i
didnt
like
it
but
because
one
may
have
been
enough
its
strong
but
i
had
another
anyway
d
i
dunno
not
my
favorite
certainly
its
flavourful
with
lots
of
nuances
but
the
carbonation
and
bitterness
are
like
sledgehammers
lacks
balance
drinkability
quite
drinkable
not
too
sweet
or
malty
even
with
the
noticeable
alcohol
it
still
goes
down
well
i
would
recommend
it
and
try
it
again
light
bronze
in
colour
with
strong
carbonation
aromas
are
of
light
caramel
malts
banana
corn
sugar
and
alcohol
warming
and
boozy
with
flavors
of
tropical
fruits
herbal
hops
gala
apple
and
a
bit
more
banana
the
carbonation
and
high
attenuation
keeps
this
beer
from
getting
too
cloying
but
it
lacks
a
certain
amount
of
complexity
to
make
it
anything
more
than
an
average
strong
belgian
ale
interestingly
one
side
of
the
bottle
says
9
alcohol
the
front
side
says
10
5
i
rather
believe
in
the
later
this
is
a
great
beer
sort
of
musty
looking
amber
caramel
color
smells
of
apple
citrus
pilsner
malt
alcohol
spice
and
a
tinge
of
hops
dangerously
carbonated
the
head
was
so
hard
to
control
on
this
one
huge
fluffy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
lingers
on
the
edges
and
leaves
minor
lacing
taste
is
fluffy
on
the
tongue
hints
of
coriander
malt
a
little
fruit
and
a
tiny
tinge
of
bitterness
this
is
nice
makes
me
think
of
fall
the
alcohol
warmth
is
nice
but
only
allows
for
a
few
unfortunately
because
of
the
availability
and
price
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
have
this
again
but
it
is
a
very
nice
bspa
from
a
750ml
bottle
and
served
in
a
snifter
poured
with
a
thick
and
frothy
head
the
thick
head
died
down
very
quickly
to
a
thin
white
foam
head
that
stayed
for
the
entire
glass
the
color
is
an
opaque
honey
the
smell
was
peppery
and
very
alcoholic
the
taste
is
peppery
as
well
with
a
note
of
pineapple
the
aftertaste
was
decently
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
or
dry
i
was
surprised
that
the
taste
wasnt
very
alcoholic
considering
the
10
5
abv
and
the
smell
has
a
nice
frothy
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
its
very
drinkable
but
maybe
not
more
than
one
in
a
row
it
sits
pretty
heavy
in
the
stomach
due
to
the
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
wondering
where
to
find
it
in
smaller
bottles
cause
the
750ml
seems
a
lot
for
one
sitting
plus
its
got
a
pirate
on
the
bottle
pirates
are
totally
better
than
ninjas
flavorful
and
complex
this
is
something
for
special
occasions
for
me
it
is
highly
drinkable
but
i
would
not
last
too
long
trying
to
session
with
this
kind
of
abv
many
years
ago
when
i
was
meddling
with
illegal
pirate
radio
transmitters
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
and
i
loved
it
at
the
time
abv
was
a
whopping
11
5
which
was
unusual
as
it
was
very
drinkable
with
the
heavy
alcohol
way
in
the
background
almost
not
present
at
all
then
abv
was
brought
down
to
10
5
this
did
not
change
the
character
of
piraat
much
it
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
nice
sweetly
tripel
maybe
this
was
the
best
version
they
made
and
which
i
enjoyed
on
a
brewery
trip
about
ten
years
ago
currently
abv
is
only
a
paltry
9
0
a
reduction
that
the
beer
did
not
survive
while
still
not
a
bad
tripel
it
is
now
average
the
taste
having
acquired
a
watery
blandness
that
was
not
present
with
the
previous
versions
i
now
only
purchase
it
if
nothing
else
is
available
smells
sweet
yeasty
and
hoppy
murky
yellow
body
with
very
thick
offwhite
head
one
thing
i
do
like
about
this
one
as
opposed
to
some
belgians
is
how
the
head
does
not
overflow
quite
as
easily
as
many
tons
of
lacing
typical
of
a
belgian
sweet
citrus
and
pine
definitely
present
alcohol
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
like
some
beers
of
this
high
an
abv
or
even
lower
very
good
flavorful
but
smooth
and
mild
pretty
good
similar
to
la
fin
du
monde
but
less
earthy
and
less
overwealming
not
sure
id
pay
11
per
bottle
all
the
time
but
not
bad
definitely
worth
the
try
d
pretty
good
a
very
special
drink
id
only
want
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
pours
into
the
tulip
extremely
clear
golden
yellow
with
2
inches
of
foamy
thin
head
and
fine
lace
smells
of
strong
spicy
alcohol
yeast
sweet
malts
black
pepper
tropical
fruits
banana
pineapple
tastes
of
somewhat
sour
medicinal
alcohol
at
the
front
becomes
gently
rounded
with
pineapple
fruit
in
the
center
and
finish
medium
body
with
fairly
big
carbonation
a
mediocre
strong
ale
in
my
opinion
piraat
ale
was
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
large
white
rocky
head
the
head
had
good
retention
a
left
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
was
yeasty
and
sort
of
peppery
with
some
light
malt
mixed
in
the
taste
was
somewhat
spicy
with
the
alcohol
evident
and
a
warming
finish
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
level
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
the
alcohol
keeps
you
from
having
more
than
a
couple
an
excellent
beer
i
will
definately
purchace
again
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
deceiving
as
you
cant
really
smell
it
but
boy
can
you
ever
taste
it
from
the
first
part
of
the
taste
it
rears
its
head
in
a
big
way
this
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
brew
a
definite
sipper
and
therefore
lowers
its
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
i
poured
it
from
a
750ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
it
has
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
amber
tint
the
head
was
thick
and
frothy
stiffly
ascending
above
the
lip
of
my
tulip
glass
with
substantial
retention
the
bouquet
is
full
of
a
blend
of
spice
and
fruit
most
notably
cinnamon
and
orange
along
with
subtle
warm
not
of
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
boquet
again
with
a
strong
citrus
presence
acidic
on
the
front
a
slight
but
pleasant
burst
of
alchohol
on
the
back

out

it
drinkability

does
hit
you
and
its
not

is
inhibited
strongly
by
the
abv

hidden
very
well
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
massive
merengue
like

that

tropical

along
with
biscuity

and
a

the

drinkability
is
ok
an
interesting
bspa
the
alcohol
is
concealed
well
enough
but
the
complexity
just
isnt
there
this
beer
nearly
overcame
my
tastebuds
absolutely
packed
with
flavour
sweet
but
not
cloying
like
a
fine
chocolate
the
sweetness
starts
off
fruity
but
reveals
a
more
nutty
and
chocolately
layer
spiciness
as
well
perhaps
a
little
clove
theres
a
little
bit
of
applepear
flavour
in
here
too
earthy
hops
try
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
but
the
scales
tip
on
the
side
of
the
more
sweet
and
spicy
notes
as
i
said
before
not
cloying
in
the
least
though
a
lovely
maltyyeastiness
comes
to
light
as
the
beer
warms
and
it
becomes
more
comforting
theres
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
this
one
but
it
really
serves
to
enhance
all
the
flavours
inherent
here
mouthfeel
is
nearperfect
bites
the
tongue
a
bit
but
the
flavours
sparkle
all
over
the
tongue
a
bit
thick
and
so
intense
so
drinkable
a
truly
great
sipping
beer
and
a
classic
belgian
this
would
make
a
perfect
afterdinner
drink
or
nightcap
after
resisting
for
quite
some
time
because
i
thought
the
bottle
version
was
way
too
alcoholic
hot
and
spicy
i
decided
to
order
the
tap
version
though
very
similar
to
the
bottled
version
with
its
fruity
spicy
and
belgiany
characters
the
fruits
seem
riper
and
fresher
in
flavor
the
alcohols
seem
to
hide
behind
better
creaminess
fuller
body
and
a
rounder
malt
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
the
beer
is
very
hot
and
spicy
but
alcohols
are
not
all
i
taste
when
on
tap
a
good
alternative
to
duvel
and
tremens
this
is
a
sipping
beer
to
get
drunk
with
its
good
and
very
complex
and
tasty
but
each
taste
brings
just
a
little
more
feel
of
alcohol
buzz
i
had
tried
this
months
ago
when
i
was
just
starting
to
figure
out
belgian
beer
and
i
remember
being
more
overwhelmed
than
appreciative
this
time
it
blew
me
away
a
new
addition
to
my
regulars
i
drank
this
with
no
preconceptions
but
i
was
still
surprised
by
the
muscular
malt
character
sure
there
is
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
but
its
the
grain
at
the
fore
balance
is
not
the
way
here
nor
should
it
be
a
strapping
abv
is
wide
open
and
mighty
warming
and
a
caution
if
there
ever
was
one
still
while
one
is
the
wisest
choice
its
one
that
does
itself
reasonably
proud
this
is
a
nice
strong
golden
belgian
beer
that
i
will
certainly
visit
again
likeable
strong
pale
ale
but
not
as
balenced
as
say
duvel
overall
this
was
quite
a
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
given
that
most
of
my
drinking
experience
over
the
past
few
months
has
consisted
of
running
down
the
best
of
ba
list
and
drinking
whatever
i
can
find
that
sounds
at
least
moderately
appealing
this
one
wasnt
all
that
impressive
however
from
a
less
biased
perspective
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
complex
beer
relatively
drinkable
for
its
alcohol
content
since
its
hard
to
find
at
least
in
my
experience
and
generally
shares
the
shelf
with
some
much
finer
offerings
i
dont
foresee
myself
having
it
again
any
time
soon
but
if
it
happens
to
pop
up
on
tap
somewhere
ill
be
sure
to
pay
my
respects
750
ml
bottle
poured
golden
clear
with
no
head
nice
and
shiny
nose
was
a
slight
bit
of
everything
some
spices
cherries
and
apples
flavor
was
ctrong
in
dried
apples
and
candied
cherries
malts
give
the
beer
a
solid
sweet
backbone
bit
of
heat
from
alcohol
tingles
the
tongue
a
bit
from
the
heat
just
a
tad
too
syrupy
though
nice
and
drinkable
with
a
hit
from
the
alcohol
poured
a
dark
goldcopper
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
haze
head
settled
quickly
smell
was
at
first
malt
then
rubbing
alcohol
taste
was
about
the
same
some
sweetness
on
the
front
followed
by
a
blast
of
alcohol
as
i
struggled
through
the
glass
i
seemed
to
also
get
a
grassy
aftertaste
my
final
thought
was
that
the
beer
left
me
feeling
like
i
had
gargled
with
alcohol
it
seemed
to
improve
a
little
bit
as
it
warmed
taste
mellowed
but
its
also
possible
that
my
tastebuds
were
just
pummeled
into
senselessness
mouthfeel
was
ok
i
think
drinkability
well
i
didnt
pour
it
out
but
i
am
not
happy
that
i
have
a
second
one
are
you
beginning
to
get
the
idea
i
didnt
like
this
beer
looking
at
the
other
reviews
i
may
have
gotten
a
skunked
beer
since
i
have
a
second
i
will
as
a
service
to
beerkind
try
it
again
cloudy
yellowy
strawlike
look
in
the
glass
with
a
strong
white
lasting
head
sweet
smell
of
grapes
which
makes
the
wine
flavoring
make
sense
im
also
tasting
a
very
strong
liquorice
and
alcohol
flavor
the
high
abv
is
quite
noticeable
this
one
is
more
sipable
than
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
too
pronounced
in
the
flavor
for
me
and
while
the
sweetness
helps
to
balance
it
a
bit
in
the
end
i
have
to
give
the
drinkability
just
a
3
0
rating
this
is
a
meal
of
a
brew
i
am
enjoying
this
bottle
but
one
will
be
enough
pretty
good
drinkability
just
a
little
too
sweet
maybe
good
though
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
beer
on
its
own
and
deserves
an
unbiased
review
pretty
good
stuff
but
not
as
good
as
a
duvel
overall
at
10
5
abv
youre
certainly
not
going
to
overlook
the
alcohol
bubbly
carbontation
and
champagnelike
texture
are
the
obvious
pluses
of
this
one
but
the
growing
candy
flavors
overtake
it
eventually
which
is
a
disappointment
bought
as
part
of
a
belgium
sample
pack
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
after
this
undertaking
though
im
not
terribly
impressed
lot
of
foreplay
with
little
stamina
body
is
medium
but
feels
bigger
fluffy
expansive
mouthfeel
with
airy
fluffed
merangue
texture
great
mouthfeel
although
as
it
warms
the
estery
alcoholic
heat
detracts
a
bit
need
a
few
years
to
dry
out
oelergud
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
true
pleasure
and
would
get
a
5
in
the
drinkability
department
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
very
distinctive
stuff
i
never
found
the
alcohol
overwhelming
though
there
is
always
the
impression
of
its
strength
id
say
this
would
make
for
a
fine
dessert
beer
the
alcohol
was
really
the
only
drawback
i
didnt
mind
it
very
much
but
it
gives
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
nail
polish
remover
bouquet
nevertheless
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
plenty
of
body
with
a
slick
creamy
mouthfeel
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
make
this
a
dangerously
delicious
offering
from
where
else
belgium
go
figure
this
belgian
brew
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
golden
color
the
head
is
a
monstrosity
good
golly
it
is
the
largest
head
ever
after
10
minutes
i
was
finally
able
to
get
the
glass
full
the
smell
is
hoppy
malty
and
citrus
with
slight
alcohol
undertones
the
carbonation
carries
up
inot
the
nose
the
taste
certainly
conveys
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
but
in
a
plesant
manner
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the
palate
and
a
bit
sticky
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
lingering
of
alcohol
this
is
a
descent
brew
worthy
of
your
attention
give
it
a
go
but
beware
the
moderately
high
abv
poured
a
golden
slightly
hazy
honey
color
thick
white
cap
that
fell
into

taverns
and

aroma
was
sweet
esters
of
ripe
banana
apple
and
citrus
root
beer
cloves
and
yeast
were
in
the
nose
lightly
a
little

was
apparant
in
nose
as

flavor
was
fruity
sweet
with
banana
and
apple
at
first
with
a
little
grapefuit
citrusy
background
some
pepper
and
spice
filled
the
palate
as
it
became
more
grapefruit
and
the
alcohol
came
out
in

good
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
hanging
bitterness
at
back
of
tounge
mouthfeel

crisp
and
refreshing
during
drink
and
finishes
dry
and
warm
drinkability
is
great
the
beer
is
crisp
refreshing
and
fruity

still
soft
poured
a
lovely
golden
color
with
massive
chunky
white
head
head
lasted
throughout

is
truly
enjoyable
with
nice
notes
of
summer
fruits
bananas
bubblegum
and
yeast
taste
is
also
very
pleasant
with
strong
banana
and
other
light
fruit
flavors
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
an
almost
syrup
like
feeling
being
left
behind
some

not
what

revised
review
and
scoring
based
on
recent
tasting
i
still
love
this
beer
very
much
after
not
having
one
for
nearly
6
months
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
beer
i
think
it
is
way
different
that
what
im
used
to
double
ipas
imperial
stouts
barleywine
etc
but
could
see
myself
getting
attached
to
it
if
i
had
the
money
light
yellow
amber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
carbonation
is
light
smells
of
cereal
light
caramel
a
hint
of
citrus
and
booze
tastemf
are
slightly
acidic
well
hopped
very
dry
and
strongly
alcoholic
mild
corn
flavors
are
also
present
i
find
the
citric
acid
to
be
a
bit
much
in
this
beer
because
it
isnt
balanced
by
any
strongly
pleasant
citrus
flavors
finishes
sweet
and
thick
body
is
full
drinkability
is
low
the
smell
was
delicious
a
combination
of
fruity
wheaty
tropical
aroma
tempered
by
a
prominent
but
pleasant
alcohol
finish
it
is
hard
for
me
to
describe
the
taste
because
it
is
so
new
and
unique
to
me
but
i
would
say
the
flavor
is
fullbodied
balanced
and
citrusy
to
sum
it
up
delicious
alcoholic
honey
it
is
quite
strong
though
as
one
beer
consumed
in
about
25
minutes
went
straight
to
the
dome
the
mouthfeel
is
ciderlike
on
drinkability
i
found
it
to
go
down
easy
but
not
a
beer
that
one
can
drink
repeatedly
in
succession
11
2
oz
bottle
with
no
visible
freshness
date
pours
a
deep
gold
hazy
almost
amber
with
a
huge
head
good
lonvity
and
very
nice
lace
grassy
and
earthy
aromas
mixed
with
a
sweet
honey
like
malt
a
bit
citrusy
and
apple
big
yeast
flavors
mixed
with
sugar
citrus
and
apple
hos
are
present
but
not
predominate
alcoholic
and
warming
a
truly
tasty
beer
but
not
one
for
a
75
degree
day
in
march
a
definate
winter
beer
very
good
none
the
less
d
although
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
as
a
whole
either
drinking
them
more
often
has
helped
me
acquire
the
taste
for
them
or
i
drink
better
belgians
as
time
goes
on
fortunately
i
bought
the
11
2oz
bottle
so
ill
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
later
tonight
taste
is
a
lot
like
duvel
spicy
with
bananas
and
pineapple
and
a
lot
more
carbonation
than
expected
thick
coating
mouthfeel
and
almost
no
aftertaste
which
is
a
nice
change
quite
a
well
balanced
beer
although
it
didnt
really
stand
out
as
something
unique
for
me
being
a
fan
of
huge
american
style
ipas
this
was
one
of
my
first
steps
out
of
my
comfort
zone
of
mindnumbingly
hopped
ipas
i
dont
think
id
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
despite
its
massive
alcohol
im
under
the
impression
my
first
bottle
had
something
wrong
with
it
the
second
time
around
this
beer
is
much
easier
to
drink
and
looks
a
whole
lot
better
to
boot
my
last
bottle
had
very
large
yeast
flakes
floating
around
way
too
many
it
seemed
for
a
little
11
2oz
bottle
my
presumption
has
proved
correct
as
this
bottle
had
only
mild
yeast
floaties
and
tasted
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
very
refreshing
for
10
5
abv
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
i
cant
say
the
brew
is
very
complex
but
it
tastes
wonderful
for
what
it
is
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
as
i
recently
had
the
boucanier
on
tap
and
it
was
much
tastier
than
its
bottled
brother
drinkability
again
strand
me
on
a
desert
island
this
is
the
one
id
want
with
me
but
due
to
its
hefty
alcohol
volume
its
one
of
those
beers
that
is
meant
to
be
savoured
not
swilled
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
is
all
one
would
need
great
beer
bottom
line
drinkability
one
of
the
sweeter
beers
i
have
had
from
this
style
very
warming
as
it
should
be
at
almost
11
tangy
and
tasty
a
sipper
and
not
one
to
be
slammed
down
allow
this
one
to
warm
and
take
your
time
goes
well
with
inidan
food
chicken
korma
in
particular
drinkability
not
feeling
the
10
5
at
all
i
suppose
the
better
stronger
beers
end
up
hiding
it
well
though
i
paid
around
4
for
the
bottle
which
i
think
is
now
well
worth
it
lots
of
balance
flavor
and
clean
sipping
very
enjoyable
beyond
impressed
with
this
overall
light
gold
with
a
faint
haze
and
bright
white
head
it
poured
with
huge
fluffy
foam
that
showed
good
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
pear
and
lemon
to
start
these
lead
into
bready
yeast
and
alcohol
thats
a
little
bit
forward
but
balanced
well
significant
sweetness
in
the
flavour
with
pepperiness
throughout
low
bitterness
initially
but
it
becomes
stronger
towards
the
finish
light
fruitiness
alcohol
appears
at
the
end
medium
bodied
generous
carbonation
offdry
with
a
hint
of
slickness
the
alcohol
could
be
hidden
better
but
theres
a
lot
of
it
to
hide
still
pretty
solid
overall
im
glad
i
bought
the
smaller
bottle
as
im
not
sure
id
be
able
to
stand
on
my
own
had
i
needed
to
polish
off
a
750ml
by
myself
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgians
though
this
one
is
worth
a
try
d
alcohol
pretty
well
hidden
but
it
does
hit
you
after
a
bit
overall
its
not
as
complex
as
i
want
out
of
a
belgian
reminiscent
of
a
good
wheat
beer
scarce
drinkability
too
much
alcohol
by
the
way
have
pirates
ever
drunk
tripel
taste
is
more
alcoholic
than
i
remembered
from
the
draft
version
but
this
has
subsided
now
that
i
have
finished
over
half
of
the
750
ml
the
flavor
contains
banana
is
bready
and
is
definitely
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
mildly
carbonated
with
big
bubbles
watch
out
for
this
one
finished
this
in
less
than
an
hour
i
remember
the
days
when
this
was
my
fallback
beer
at
chalkies
well
it
was
this
or
gulden
draak
both
on
tap
at
all
times
those
were
the
days
very
drinkable
not
much
hop
presence
very
good
not
as
sweet
as
i
prefer
but
not
bad
overall
and
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
high
abv
not
even
really
noticeable
until
it
was
gone
and
i
had
to
try
and
type
drinkability
while
not
the
best
bspa
youre
likely
to
run
across
reasonably
priced
tasty
and
quite
potent
you
could
do
worse
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
my
cheeks
are
burning
my
mouth
is
watering
and
i
wish
id
bought
more
yum
d
good
approachable
but
the
alcohol
taste
begins
to
turn
me
off
bham
uk
jan
2006
the
alcohol
presence
is
extremely
understated
and
very
well
hidden
this
could
be
a
very
dangerous
session
belgian
at
10
5abv
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
i
recommend
it
for
fans
of
the
style
very
good
example
of
the
type
i
look
forward
to
doing
some
oneonone
comparisons
between
piraat
and
duvel
all
in
all
a
unique
take
on
the
tripel
style
the
higher
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
here
as
it
worked
better
in
gulden
draake
certainly
a
great
beer
to
have
time
and
again
piraat
is
better
than
the
average
bspa
but
has
a
long
long
way
to
go
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
the
greats
of
the
style
it
lacks
that
certain
something
that
puts
a
twinkle
in
my
eye
and
a
spring
in
my
step
but
i
still
had
a
good
time
with
the
bottle
watch
out
for
that
abv
itll
plunder
your
booty
if
you
arent
careful
d
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
some
time
and
finally
picked
up
a
single
from
a
store
while
on
vacation
this
one
was
everything
i
expected
it
to
be
although
maybe
ever
so
slightly
sweeter
than
i
thought
a
good
representation
of
the
pale
belgian
style
i
recommend
and
will
have
it
again
this
is
an
impressive
brew
although
it
is
a
little
more
aggressive
than
the
standard
very
enjoyable
bottomline
a
little
lacking
in
the
nose
but
otherwise
a
very
nice
belgian
strong
pale
ale
perhaps
i
served
it
a
little
too
cool
to
allow
the
aroma
to
develop
properly
overall
not
a
beer
id
repeat
totally
disappointing
100
forgettable
to
everything
except
my
pocketbook
if
i
want
a
booze
bomb
well
i
suppose
its
allright
but
thats
what
distilled
alcohol
is
for
this
beer
came
a
slightly
cloudy
yet
glowing
golden
yellow
with
a
meringue
like
head
that
was
perfectly
flat
with
no
discernable
bubbles
there
were
a
swarm
of
tiny
bubbles
lazily
making
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
tulip
glass
smelled
of
marshmallows
with
lots
of
bubble
gum
banana
and
oranges
and
a
touch
of
black
pepper
tasted
creamy
with
an
intense
powdered
sugar
sweetness
coupled
with
a
green
grape
sourness
and
a
touch
of
celery
there
is
a
lovely
spicy
yeast
finish
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
in
the
finish
also
i
cant
detect
a
lick
of
alcohol
the
mouth
feel
is
very
dense
and
viscous
that
is
entirely
too
syrupy
this
really
detracts
from
the
drinkability
as
it
makes
one
think
of
green
grape
concentrate
a
little
too
thick
to
be
enjoyed
but
if
you
can
separate
the
mouth
feel
from
the
flavor
youre
in
for
a
treat
teaser
reckons
that
it
gets
yucky
as
it
heats
up
and
i
agree
that
the
alcohol
becomes
a
little
too
much
sadly
not
a
beer
as
good
as
its
cousin
the
boucanier
but
still
ok
a
near
perfect
brew
totally
in
league
with
duvel
and
other
great
belgians
poured
out
to
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
pillow
of
white
cloud
like
foam
that
was
well
lived
nice
lacing
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
rich
sweet
malts
yeast
grass
and
grain
very
fresh
and
lively
smelling
taste
was
quite
good
flavors
of
malts
grain
dough
and
yeast
meet
the
palate
in
good
balance
along
with
pineapple
flavors
and
sweet
citrus
smooth
aftertaste
good
mouthfeel
light
and
medium
bodied
yet
slightly
chewy
toward
the
finish
very
good
level
of
drinkability
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
soon
highly
recommended
belgian
really
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
the
powerful
punch
of
alcohol
is
not
really
balanced
by
strong
flavors
or
smells
this
is
like
a
beer
flavored
after
dinner
drink
one
11
2
oz
bottle
is
enough
for
metasty
in
an
expiremental
way
sigh
ill
let
myself
out
d
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
an
intense
ride
for
sure
but
well
worth
it
worth
the
price
tag
that
is
a
tough
call
if
the
option
presents
itself
then
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
but
i
dont
think
it
will
for
a
very
long
time
the
contents
330

poured

is
deep
hazy
orange
nearly
opaque
even
when
held
to
light
light
contoured

this
is
a
big
beer
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
many
belgian
strong
ales
starts
with
some
grainy
malts
middle
opens
into
liquorices
root
finishes
with
aniseed
and
a
return
to
the
crisp
citrus
detected
in
the
smell
warm
and
fuzzy
piraat
triple
is
quite
drinkable
for
its
alcohol
content
and
style
drinkable
but
strong
make
this
your
night
cap
overall
i
love
belgians
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
good
but
a
little
too
much
alcohol
in
your
face
cheers
overall
a
top
notch
belgian
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
highly
recommended
here
it
is
a
detriment
the
same
way
it
ruins
imho
dolle
teve

just
a
thought
drop
it
to
78
or
find
a
way
to
mask
it
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
relatively
thin
fluffy
head
leaving
quite
sticky
and
fine
white
lace
nose
is
a
complex
mixture
of
spices
malts
and
somewhat
fruity
taste
is
very
malty
and
sugary
at
the
beginning
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
fruityness
in
the
middle
with
a
warming
alcoholic
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
but
is
nice
and
lively
overall
frinkability
is
ok
the
abv
is
very
present
at
the
beginning
and
takes
some
getting
used
to
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
is
a
bit
expensive
an
excellent
beer
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
carbonated
arrrrhhh
keep
the
piraat
i
will
take
duval
330
ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
hazy
yellow
with
a
small

sugary
fruity
aroma
smells
like
pineapple
orange
juice
sweet
malty
flavor
very
fruity
perhaps
a
little
too
much
finishes
with
some
spicy
hops
i
would
like
this
more
if
the
hops
were
more
assertive
the
alcohol
content
is
high
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
average
this
beer
had
a
very
strange
flavor
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
doubt
this
is
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
overall
piraat
was
pretty
tasty
and
a
nice
pairing
with
a
dinner
of
seasoned
swordfish
steaks
rice
and
a
garden
salad
my
wife
liked
the
draft
version
she
had
a
couple
weeks
ago
better
saying
this
one
was
a
bit
too
sweet
id
have
to
agree
but
its
still
a
worthwhile
version
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
unbelievable
beer
white
frothy
head
fruity
taste
that
is
balanced
by
some
truly
light
and
powerfull
hops
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
many
times
but
today
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
library
ale
house
in
santa
monica
so
excited
to
have
a
beer
i
love
on
tap
and
hard
to
find
orange
color
with
a
meaty
head
that
retreats
somewhat
quickly
taste
is
a
strong
belgian

like

from

this
beer
burns
mouthfeel
is
medium

this
is
a
fairly
good

ive
had

belgian
candi
sugar
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
yeasty
bready
content
hops
are
quite
noticeable
and
stronger
than
most
belgians
i
have
encountered
finish
has
an
alcohol
drying
linger
to
it
nicely
done
but
nothing
amazing
about
this
offering
i
am
surprised
to
see
this
beer
is
10
5
abv
seems
like
8
at
most
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
but
the
carbonation
is
a
tad
too
high
it
helps
calm
the
alcohol
but
id
rather
have
the
burn
w
out
effervescence
nice
bitter
finish
and
very
clean
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
will
look
for
this
one
on
tap
i
believe
ive
seen
it
at
redbones
once
or
twice
will
need
to
compare
drinkability
clean
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
an
old
favorite
that
i
have
had
many
times
and
finally
decided
to
take
notes
and
review
it
i
also
think
this
beer
is
an
excellent
beer
to
give
people
who
are
now
to
good
beer
its
not
offensive
at
all
and
it
is
very
gentle
and
welcoming
to
new
palates
this
was
my
first
above
6
beer
wow
excellent
it
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
head
not
sure
if
this
is
right
but
thats
what
happend
waited
a
little
while
for
head
to
dissipate
taste
was
kind
of
sweet
alcohol
was
definitely
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
aftertaste
was
very
nice
kind
of
gave
me
a
warm
feeling
for
a
brew
with
a
high
abv
it
was
very
drinkable
will
buy
more
in
the
very
near
future
recommended
for
the
sweetloving
belgian
heads
out
there
but
for
some
people
such
as
myself
who
love
the
wellroundedness
of
beers
such
as
st
bernardus
or
the
trappist
brewers
this
can
be
a
bit
too
much
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
bright
cloudy
golden
with
a
decent
off
white
head
of
large
bubbles
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
bready
fruity
citrus
and
spice
aromas
fruity
pear
apple
lemon
and
spicy
flavors
full
bodied
with
a
mildly
carbonated
smooth
mouthfeel
sweet
finish
with
alcohol
present
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
we
got
a
winner
here
mates
i
lift
me
tankard
to
this
one
and
will
drink
it
with
all
the
bravado
a
swarthy
pirate
of
the
carribean
can
muster
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
course
possibly
from
the
abv
and
carbonation
i
might
have
another
after
this
one
i
think
i
like
it
a
little
more
than
duvel
but
its
close
i
personally
am
not
bowled
over
by
the
beer
came
in
a
33cl
stubby
brown
bottle
with
best
before
date
072006
the
appearance
is
a
deep
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
real
thick
head
poured
into
its
traditional
glass
not
nearly
as
complex
as
its
similar
counterpart
duvel
and
the
alcohol
content
isnt
as
well
masked
either
still
it
gave
a
warm
pleasant
feel
to
the
stomach
afterwards
so
its
worth
a
try
if
you
are
bold
enough
to
try
a
fantastic
belgian
pale
ale
nice
crisp
hops
really
pick
everything
up
a
very
tasty
beer
drinkability
far
to
sweet
to
be
an
ipa
and
far
too
weird
to
be
pleasant
looks
like
duvel
and
drinks
like
duvel
but
shiver
my
timbers
it
is
not
duvel
piraat
is
a
decent
take
on
the
blonde
genre
and
suffers
a
little
bit
from
the
intial
alcohol
taste
that
hits
the
palate
too
early
the
beer
mellows
more
the
further
you
drain
the
glass
a
decent
beer
but
alas
lacks
the
complexity
and
grace
that
duvel
provides
well
im
almost
sure
this
is
the
right
beer
piraat
on
the
label
brouwerij
van
steenberge
10
5
alcohol
but
amber
triple
ipa
i
think
that
is
a
misprint
the
beer
i
have
is
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
slight
yeast
cloud
and
a
solid
whit
head
it
has
a
great
spicey
yeast
aroma
peppery
with
perhaps
a
little
corriander
balanced
with
mild
floral
hop
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
slightly
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
with
a
wheat
malt
and
yeast
finish
the
body
is
good
and
it
seems
to
hide
the
10
5
well
this
is
a
smooth
beer
this
beer
seems
like
the
textbook
definition
of
a
trippel
and
based
on
that
i
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
smell
was
characteristic
of
american
ipas
ive
tried
malty
with
a
sort
of
fruity
sweetness
and
a
blend
of
alcohol
within
decieving
because
the
flavour
wasnt
quite
as
much
id
say
the
basic
american
ipa
comparison
point
wouldnt
be
the
first
part
in
the
tasting
a
sweet
fruity
and
bread
like
sweetness
even
possibly
a
tripel
or
a
belgian
pale
but
rather
the
harsh
in
a
good
way
bitterness
coming
right
behind
it
the
only
beef
i
have
is
that
it
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
beers
properties
and
makes
it
less
drinkable
all
in
all
though
a
good
purchase
this
triple
pours
a
nice
amber
gold
a
thick
never
ending
white
head
meet
the
top
of
this
beer
and
give
way
to
a
nice
thick
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
with
a
grassy
musty
feel
to
it
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
honey
like
quality
with
some
fruit
like
sweet
green
grapes
mixed
in
quite
impressive
at
the
least
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
ever
so
slightly
with
this
beer
and
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
it
is
very
smooth
creamy
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
and
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
you
can
sum
up
this
brew
in
one
word
wow
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
12
offwhite
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
amber
brew
head
is
shortlived
and
lacing
is
minimal
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
sour
funk
with
some
belgian
malt
sweetness
taste
is
slightly
spicy
belgian
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
tang
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
very
approachable
for
a
tripel
van
steenberge
is
a
brewery
to
watch
with
lots
of
interesting
offerings
people
criticize
this
beer
for
lacking
complexity
and
i
agree
steenberge
makes
plenty
of
complex
beers
bornem

this

received
this
11
2
oz
bottle
as
part
of
a
christmas
present
appearance
was
an
opaque
dark
orange
or
honey
color
and
produced
a
2finger
head
stream
of
carbonation
came
from
the
bottom
smell
was
malt
and
citrus
particularly
lemon
taste
was
banana
cloves
apple
and
slightly
bitter
towards
the
end
alcohol
was
a
bit
upfront
in
the
taste
and
smell
mouthfeel
was
moderate
but
warm
and
bready
towards
the
end
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
but
i
got
knocked
out
after
drinking
it
this
is
a
pretty
good
strong
pale
ale
but
the
alcohol
could
have
been
tucked
away
a
bit
more
cleverly
bottle
looks
like
honey
in
the
glass
light
carbonation
small
frothy
head
that
lasts
as
a
cap
aroma
of
musty
fruit
mouth
is
a
pleasant
surprise
medium
body
even
a
bit
smooth
noted
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
very
pleasing
beer
feel
to
this
drink
only
hint
of
alcohol
is
the
warm
finish
and
the
peachbanana
phenols
one
whiffs
just
prior
to
the
swallow
big
beer
with
little
complexity
a
let
down
i
liked
this
belgian
and
my
wife
really
loved
it
shes
coming
around
very
fine
belgian
pale
ale
i
found
the
alcohol
flavor
a
bit
strong
but
great
nonetheless
a
fine
fine
grog
she
be
drinkability
is
quite
high
the
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
perhaps
that
is
a
warning
10
5
abv
should
not
be
taken
lightly
no
matter
how
good
it
is
what
a
beer
as
big
as
it
is
it
feels
balanced
the
hops
stand
out
which
is
impressive
in
the
style
whatever
this
one
is
if
i
were
to
taste
this
blind
id
peg
it
as
american
brewed
with
its
hybridized
feel
i
dont
think
i
could
make
a
habit
of
this
stuff
but
it
would
certainly
appeal
to
those
that
like
a
strong
cocktail
sticky
sweet
with
a
boozey
prickle
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
up
another
taste
provided
im
not
driving
home
poured
a
pale
golden
colour
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
never
completely
goes
away
and
laced
well
smells
almost
like
peanut
butter
and
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
is
amazing
smooth
and
malty
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
very
warming
from
the
high
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
when
drinking
it
this
is
a
very
flavourful
strong
pale
and
i
want
another
overall
a
solid
belgian
ipa
a
outstanding
beer
from
top
to
bottom
this
one
poured
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
a
huge
pillowy
white
head
that
stuck
to
my
glass
till
the
last
drop
the
smell
was
good
with
a
touch
of
grass
a
hint
of
pepper
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
the
taste
was
exceptional
with
a
nice
sweet
not
overly
thick
maltiness
to
start
out
with
followed
by
a
very
nice
peppery
flavor
mixed
slight
hops
and
finnished
with
a
great
fruity
aftertaste
that
was
made
up
of
a
great
pinnapple
flavor
at
10
5
this
is
one
to
sip
and
savor
for
sure
very
highly
recommended
this
wasnt
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
probably
because
of
its
high
alcohol
content
but
it
was
certainly
very
very
tasty
pours
an
ever
so
lightly
hazy
deep
gold
color
and
is
topped
by
an
off
white
head
that
is
medium
sized
the
aroma
is
dry
grassy
herbal
and
has
a
spiciness
that
is
a
bit
akin
to
coriander
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
grassy
finish
that
lingers
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
in
its
herbalgrassy
character
this
beer
has
some
bright
fruitiness
to
it
as
well
evoking
notes
of
pear
apple
white
grapes
and
yellow
raisins
again
this
is
pretty
good
beer
if
not
a
bit
sweet
creamy
longlasting
head
with
excellent
lacing
medium
yellowgold
in
color
smell
was
odd
something
seemed
off
unbelievable
the
difference
between
smell
and
taste
the
taste
was
great
sweet
on
the
front
rounding
into
a
tartness
and
a
very
nice
overtone
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
light
tart
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
high
abv
very
easy
to
drink
id
have
another
although
at
10
5
abv
i
might
regret
it
one
centimeter
of
fine
noisy
white
head
leaves
filmy
lacing
the
beer
is
a
clear
orangegold
thats
a
very
nice
color
the
nose
is
spicy
orangey
hoppy
excellent
the
front
is
spicy
with
citrus
sweet
corn
fresh
grass
and
pepper
rich
caramel
in
the
very
buttery
middle
the
finish
sees
a
nice
sweet
corn
reprise
with
alcohol
and
a
nice
grassy
hoppy
bitter
bite
this
is
wonderful
fullflavored
delicious
a
nice
hoppy
spicy
fruity
belgian
very
drinkable
tasty
and
smooth
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
one
is
fun
really
hits
the
spot
my
friend
and
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
the
store
and
both
being
pirate
fans
decided
we
had
to
try
it
this
beer
poured
a
pale
brown
from
a
11
5
oz
bottle
with
a
very
huge
fluffy
white
head
and
it
stayed
for
a
a
minute
or
so
i
was
actually
not
expecting
this
as
i
wasnt
even
pouring
it
quickly
it
smelled
of
alcohol
and
citrus
the
taste
was
spicy
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
strength
definitely
made
it
harsher
and
brought
down
the
drinkability
you
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
this
was
the
first
belgian
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
wasnt
let
down
it
was
delicious
piraat
for
me
is
ok
at
best
i
wont
be
buying
one
of
these
again
very
expensive

plus
some

yeasty
aroma
and
a
vague
leathery
quality
flavor
is
very
distinct
with
elements
of
leather
fruit
peels
more

this
is
a
big
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
with
a
clear
golden
honey
yellow
with
a
fluffy
rocky
white
head
fruity
spicy
aroma
with
lots
of
citrus
notes
spicy
corriander
and
good
hop
aroma
all
infront
of
an
estery
alcohol
background
spicy
explosin
of
co2
in
your
mouth
followed
by
warming
alcohol
and
a
nice
sugary
malt
mouthfeel
that
is
moderately
syrupy
a
very
warming
beer
and
very
drinkable
as
much
as
this
style
is
drinkable
i
like
most
belgian
beers
this
is
not
one
of
them
flat
strange
tasting
beer
plenty
of
alcohol
which
is
well
hidden
it
just
has
a
weird
taste
that
i
cant
describe
there
are
so
many
great
beers
of
this
style
dont
bother
with
this
even
the
bier
du
bouccanier
if
fresh
blows
this
away
pours
out
a
orangegolden
color
with
a
huge
thick
head
that
never
goes
away
it
seems
smell
consisted
of
all
sorts
of
things
malts
citrus
grass
and
some
slight
alcohol
can
also
be
detected
kinda
wild
almost
taste
was
actually
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
wow
is
this
thing
thick
after
taking
that
first
sip
i
knew
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
thick
brew
almost
looks
like
a
duvel
but
nowhere
as
thick
as
that
beer
is
citrus
and
honey
and
malts
hit
the
palate
first
with
some
caramel
and
some
hop
kick
towards
the
middle
and
end
a
little
bit
of
that
10
5
can
be
detected
but
is
masked
well
by
the
hops
and
citrus
notes
at
first
i
didnt
know
whether
i
was
going
to
like
it
or
not
but
this
does
get
the
job
done
yes
its
a
thick
beer
but
its
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
worth
a
shot
for
sure
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
good
off
white
head
retention
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
smell
is
hope
like
and
slightly
sour
taste
is
disappointing
alcohol
is
a
dominant
factor
in
the
taste
here
and
not
in
a
good
way
other
high
alcohol
beers
blend
the
alcohol
taste
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
balance
with
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
liqueurlike
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
only
having
a
subtle
impact
slight
hops
aftertaste
is
of
whiskey
or
ironically
enough
rum
this
beer
just
isnt
right
for
me
im
adding
this
to
my
staple

that
may
sound

flavors
some

drifts
up
into
the
sinuses
but
not
overpowering
with
this
abv
the
alcohol
is
nicely
underplayed
in
the
taste
profile
but
it
will
catch
up
to
you
in
a
hurry
mouthfeel
is
full
and
very
pleasant
because
of
abv
drinkability
is
not
as
highly
rated
huge
cumulous

pure
bliss
strong

foward
this
is

but
all
the
flavors
and
body
conceal
the

well
complex
tasty
strong
full
of
character
and
interest
glad
i
went
for
this
one

it
out

difficult

glad
to
find

64
oz
growler
from
half
time
poured
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
puffy
cloud
like
head
full
of
bubbles
constant
line
of
bubbles
coming
out
of
the
deep
recesses
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
much
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
grand
cru
sharp
esters
orange
peel
slight
honey
flavors
all
blended
together
with
an
almost
brandy
like
quality
taste
was
very
sweet
and
almost
like
a
less
hoppy
version
of
the
american
double
ipa
sweet
peach
and
green
raisin
flavors
juicy
malt
characteristics
slight
hoppy
finish
that
adds
just
a
slight
note
of
piney
bitterness
in
the
end
sticky
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
but
not
overbearing
good
beer
and
a
nice
belgian
with
a
note
of
british
influence
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
probably
the
only
disappointing
part
of
this
beer
the
color
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
bit
of
stark
white
head
that
recedes
into
a
light
top
and
ring
smell
lots
of
fruity
sweetness
spice
wheat
hops
mustard
lemoncitrius
the
taste
is
amazingly
complex
it
starts
out
with
a
hit
of
sweet
fruit
and
syrup
and
it
quickly
blends
into
the
slightly
salty
meaty
spiced
flavors
with
mustard
and
the
wheaty
malts
the
aftertaste
blends
into
a
wonderful
mix
of
hops
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
in
body
weight
and
is
perfectly
carbonated
the
warm
feeling
that
you
get
drinking
it
is
wonderful
to
warm
up
to
on
a
cold
spring
evening
and
it
also
lets
you
know
full
well
that
what
youre
drinking
is
strong
enough
to
knock
a
mule
on
its
head
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
hope
halftime
keeps
this
on
tap
for
a
while
i
got
a
hold
of
a
growler
of
the
piraat
at
half
time
along
with
complimentary
piraat
tulip
glasses
and
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
on
a
clear
chilly
late
spring
evening
i
must
say
it
was
the
perfect
choice
it
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
medium
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
quite
complexhops
and
belgian
spices
swirling
in
a
harmonic
blend
that
is
very
enticing
the
first
taste
is
delightfulcloves
banana
hops
that
together
with
an
underlying
peppery
backbone
mask
mischieviously
the
high
alcohol
content
i
admit
i
was
not
sure
id
cotton
to
this
combination
but
it
works
though
i
found
the
mouthfeel
a
tad
too
thin
definitely
a
worthy
choice
beer
is
good
happy
beering
poured
an
intense
amount
of
head
into
my
tulip
belgian
bubble
bath
shooting
out
of
the
glass
beautiful
golden
and
slightly
cloudy
great
head
retention
great
aroma
of
sweetness
and
fruits
lightly
yeasty
and
citrus
fresh
tasting
nice
bite
and
alcohol
taste
to
it
which
i
do
appreciate
the
more
it
warmed
the
more
i
taste
tart
apples
also
makes
me
think
of
the
taste
of
bananas
foster
eaten
with
a
beer
10
5
which
is
always
nice
too
very
drinkable
and
one
i
have
shared
with
a
beer
newbie
who
just
loved
it
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
slightly
syrupy
and
overall
its
a
fairly
thick
bodied
beer
carbonation
is
low
but
moves
well
through
the
mouth
just
the
one
330ml
would
suit
me
fine
a
very
nice
treat
pours
a
muted
lemonstraw
color
with
a
good
deal
of
haze
and
persistent
active
carbonation
the
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
quickly
dissipates
though
a
fine
lace
clings
aggressively
to
the
glass
yeast
and
grass
scents
are
prounounced
as
is
a
soft
peppery
spiciness
some
underlying
malt
sweetness
is
detectable
as
well
full
honeysweet
malt
flavor
gives
way
quickly
to
a
massive
wave
of
alcohol
warmth
and
some
peppery
spice
while
the
warmth
persists
it
gradually
yields
to
the
grassy
notes
that
are
so
noticeable
in
the
smell
full
mouthfeel
is
sticky
but
not
annoyingly
cloyingly
so
a
unique
interesting
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
wants
to
overflow
the
glass
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
scent
which
brags
of
belgian
pale
malts
and
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
very
intense
and
warms
on
the
finish
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
yeast
flavor
that
is
pleasant
it
goes
down
easy
for
having
such
a
high
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
belgian
ale
but
i
think
that
its
a
little
too
overhyped
cheers
750ml
bottle
poured
at
the
delirium
cafe
in
belgium
this
is
a
yelloworangey
liquid
with
a
thick
white
top
of
foam
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
and
consist
of
citrus
fruits
sugar
cotton
candy
bubblegum
spicy
herbal
hops
light
doughy
malts
and
more
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
spicy
from
the
interesting
hopping
that
this
beer
has
the
malts
are
a
bit
subdued
but
lend
a
nice
bready
element
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
thick
or
too
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
good
but
hindered
by
the
extreme
sweetness
of
this
brew
i
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
ontap
at
eulogy
in
philly
this
was
an
very
good
triple
which
had
a
nice
golden
color
and
a
nice
frothy
creamy
white
head
the
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
which
is
completely
consistent
for
this
style
as
another
mentioned
it
is
light
but
not
watery
it
has
a
tad
more
of
an
alcohol
bite
than
ive
had
with
others
of
this
style
but
given
its
10
5
abv
it
still
hides
the
percentage
pretty
well
not
the
most
drinkable
triple
but
still
very
good
this
is
drinkable
enough
to
drink
all
night
but
the
abv
would
kick
your
ass
the
next
day
this
brew
comes
out
a
cloudy
orange
color
and
has
a
good
size
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
scent
is
citrusy
and
a
little
malty
the
taste
has
a
spicy
bite
to
it
from
the
warming
alcohol
sweet
citrusy
tastes
as
well
bitterspicy
hops
a
full
mouthfeel
this
is
a
highoctane
beer
enjoyed
in
a
9
ounce
glass
at
chumleys
in
lafayette
this
poured
a
nice
golden
color
will
a
super
small
white
foam
head
smell
is
very
fruity
and
upon
first
sip
i
know
why
this
beer
smells
so
fruity
massive
notes
of
blueberry
backed
by
a
dry
spiced
body
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
above
average
and
drinkability
is
not
that
great
as
this
beer
sits
extremely
heavy
in
your
stomach
this
is
a
quality
brew
but
definately
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
surely
worth
the
shot
though
very
duvel
like
with
less
malt
backbone
balancing
the
big
hop
profile
very
refreshing
for
a
strong
ale
mmmmm
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
amber
hue
under
a
thick
white
2
finger
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
last
leaving
some
uneven
spots
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
lovely
fruit
spice
malt
and
hop
all
mixed
together
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
heavy
with
sweetness
and
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
stick
at
all
crisp
and
fresh
the
taste
is
a
cornucopia
of
sensations
from
candy
to
mint
to
malt
to
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
champagne
to
it
dry
yet
sweet
the
dry
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
accompanied
by
a
touch
of
fruit
sweetness
very
good
brew
somewhat
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
still
a
after
dinnersipping
beer
pours
a
beautiful
honey
amber
with
a
billowy
offwhite
head
that
is
slow
to
settle

fruity
notes
and
alcohol
over
belgian
hops
some
sour
acidic
qualities
flavor
is
a
bit
stronger
on
the
alcohol
but
is
still
not
overpowering
for
10
5
a
very
nice
brewthe
acidity
lasts
throughout
and
the

almost
berry
notes
mixed
with

are
very
pleasant
very
worthwhile
comments
i
dont
think
i
could
say
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
it
certainly
demands
respect
for
both
its
strength
and
its
complexity
however
i
certainly
had
no
problem
easing
my
way
through
an
entire
750ml
bottle
but
the
sheer
power
of
this
beer
prevents
it
from
being
anything
you
would
likely
drink
all
night
long
as
sooner
or
later
youll
fall
off
your
chair
i
had
heard
many
things
about
this
beer
mainly
good
so
had
to
try
it
on
tap
last
night
pours
a
goldorange
color
with
a
big
fluffy
headthe
aroma
has
big

very
herbal
and
grassy
taste
is
very
citriusy
and
tart
with
some
late
hop
coming
thruvery
grassy
and
herbal
aftertaste
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
not
a
top
notch
belgian
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
clear
golden
streams
of
co2
surface
at
a
nice
clip
the
head
is
fluffy
and
airy
and
eggshell
colored
retention
is
very
good
aroma
is
of
must
lime
peel
dough
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
too
gaseous
makes
me
burp
too
much
and
its
hard
to
swallow
the
flavors
really
do
not
do
much
for
me
harsh
citric
tones
of
lime
and
lemon
very
little
yeast
or
dough
contributions
and
theres
a
husky
astringency
to
it
as
well
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
pours
a
fluffy
thick
white
threefingered
head
fades
very
slowly
and
leaves
gobs
of
lace
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
color
is
a
light
golden
nose
is
malty
and
has
raisin
overtones
starts
and
finishes

with
some

330ml
bottle
hazy
peachy
honeyyellow
hue
it
was
served
with
a
very
small
white
head
about
half
a
finger
in
height
the
bartender
filled
my
glass
to
the
maximum
with
this
nectar
i
guess
i
cant
fault
him
for
that
the
head
that
was
presented
did
last
for
the
entire
consumption
as
i
quaffed
a
good
amount
of
lace
was
produced
this
is
a
fine
looking
beverage
the
nose
is
plenty
pleasant
with
fresh
cut
grass
hay
spicy
alcohol
and
yeast
peppery
and
fruity
it
is
a
wellrounded
nose
albeit
typical
for
the
style
the
palate
is
wonderfully
complex
grass
marijuana
pears
grapes
pepper
spice
and
notes
of
wheat
apples
and
hot
candy
yet
sweet
this
is
an
absolutely
lovely
drink
i
cant
help
but
sip
and
savor
the
alcohol
heat
becomes
great
as
it
warms
oh
it
hurts
so
good
the
hops
bitterness
is
very
noticeable
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
especially
at
the
finish
mediumfull
mouthfeel
this
was
surprising
at
how
filling
it
was
modest
and
natural
carbonation
what
a
very
enjoyable
quaff
i
dont
think
this
is
comparable
to
duvel
or
orval
it
is
damn
good
and
unique
recommended
more
of
a
specialty
beer
than
a
drinking
beer
bet
this
would
be
great
hot
with
a
cinnamon
stick
it
tastes
a
lot
like

330ml
bottle
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
orange
colored
beer
the
head
forms
to
a
moderate
depth
and
thickness
and
has
wonderful
staying
power
a
strong
aroma
here
and
odd
in
a
great
way
its
a
bit
musty
also
pungent
citrus
and
penetrating
alcohol
alcohol
dominates
the
flavors
of
this
beer
also
well
noticeable
is
a
dark
spicyness
and
dark
fruityness
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
while
being
a
bit
syrupy
i
cant
really
say
i
would
want
another
one
after
having
just
one
small
bottle
of
it
its
very
strong
with
alcohol
flavor
and
warms
my
stomach
up
enough
to
be
pleased
with
just
one
but
everything
else
about
it
is
great
yummy
the
nice
bitter
hop
finish
on
the
palate
pleases
me
i
couldnt
find
a
chilled
ipa
and
that
is
what
i
wanted
but
this
satisfied
my
need
for
a
hop
monster
for
now
anyway
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
done
solid
and
fantastic
tasting
ale
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
still
is
quite
warming
in
the
mouth
on
the
finish
lots
of
tropical
fruits
but
still
somewhat
bready
and
yeasty
with
an
interesting
malt
flavor
super
beer
to
linger
over
for
all
kinds
of
reasons
enjoy
notes
this
is
a
wonderful
belgian
strong
pale
ale
goat

is

quick
and
perfect
pairing

the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
whitish
head
forming
which
quickly
resided
leaving
a
blotchy
lace
pattern
the
smell
had
a
sweet
honey
and
fresh
lawn
grass
qualitywith
pleasant
hop
aromatics
subtle
coriander
yeast
and
a
strong
alcoholic
component
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
beer
pulls
in
somewhat
thin
but
immediatly
becomes
silky
and
full
triumphantly
carrying
a
parade
of
flavor
onto
the
palate
a
semisweet
honey
and
candysugar
backbone
with
notes
of
grass
and
pepper
finishing
with
a
welldone
cap
of
bitterness
which
lingers
on
with
the
honey
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
were
not
overdone
and
the
flavor
was
so
delicious
arrgg
i
am
love
the
way
that
this
beer
poured
out
the
color
was
a
burnt
orange
and
the
head
was
light
and
creamy
the
lacing
was
massive
and
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
carbonation
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
was
a
wonderful
wheaty
honey
sweet
start
to
this
beer
and
the
finish
was
crisp
for
being
10
5
i
cannot
pick
up
any
alcohol
taste
whatsoever
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
it
is
a
distant
second
from
something
like
don
de
dieu
overall
another
winner
from
the
makers
of
gulden
draak
crystal
clear
amber
with
full
white
head
that
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lace
even
after
receding
to
a
film
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
very
little
aroma
but
what
there
was
was
fruity
and
sweet
crisp
carbonation
and
strong
hopping
keep
it
from
feeling
syrupy
candy
sweetness
pepper
and
alcohol
fill
out
the
taste
very
nice
for
such
an
agressive
beer
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
abv
but
this
was
a
good
beer
served
in
11
2
oz
bottle
dark
amber
with
a
nice
ample
white
head
first
impression
is
malt
and
alcohollots
of
it
lots
and
lots
of
yeast
in
this
one
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
hop
hint
at
the
end
caramel
color
and
taste
one
of
my
favorites
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
lingering
taste
of
candy
if
it
didnt
have
so
much
alcohol
i
would
drink
lots
of
this
at
any
sitting
oh
and
sort
the
fucking
backward
sails
out
on
the
viking
longboat
label
chaps
its
really
annoying
me
either
that
or
put
a
proper
picture
of
a
pirate
ship
on

just
ask
captain
russell
crowe
hell
help
you
out
with
pictures
lol
the
taste
is
pure
belgian
clean
strong
complex
if
only
i
were
more
experienced
i
could
begin
to
describe
this
beer
when
it
comes
to
belgian
ales
i
feel
limited
in
my
ability
to
accurately
write
what
its
like
to
drink
them
just
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
find
piraat
try
it
just
enjoy
it
in
moderation
its
quite
the
heavyhitter
hazy
golden
orange
colored
with
a
thick
beige
head
interesting
aromas
smells
like
theres
more
hops
than
your
average
belgian
vinous
yeasty
and
malty
aromas
as
well
as
a
big
alcohol
nose
that
is
almost
organic
and
musty
sweet
candi
sugar
hits
the
palate
first
then
the
10
5
abv
kicks
in
finishing
of
a
bit
dry
and
a
bit
sweet
alcohol
lingers
begging
for
another
sip
this
beer
has
quite
the
fan
base
at
my
work
ones

a

there
is

the

there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
a
little
tart
at
first
not
expected
overripe
grapes
dominate
and
bits
of
sweetness
are
present
an
overload
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
no
hiding
it
in
this
one
also
a
little
bit
of
peppery
spices
linger
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
and
heavy
the
drinkability
lacks
a
little
due
to
the
high
alcohol
taste
not
a
bad
belgian
comments

probably
too
strong
and
alcoholic
for
most
dont
make
this
your
first
of
the
night
and
dont
make
it
your
last
an
aggressive
triple
this
is
less
complex
and
refined
than
some
triples
namely
the
more
trappiststyled
but
not
a
loss
because
of
it
a
good
turn
on
a
classic
style
hoppier
and
thinner
in
taste
than
most
but
easy
enough
to
drink
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
moderate
head
smells
of
mostly
alcohol
and
hops
tastes
very
strongly
of
alcohol
which
is
not
a
good
thing
this
is
the
fourth
beer
i
had
out
of
this
sampler
and
it
the
least
pleasant
one
to
date
still
very
good
comparitively
better
than
100
of
the
macro
brews
out
there
pours

mediumbodied
extremely

very
sweet

and
very

turns

and

bitterness
the
warming
is
incredible
very
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
but
not
one
of
my
top
favorites
drinkability
is
scored
as
average
as
the
heavy
body
and
very
noticeable
alcohol
makes
this
as
a
one
or
two
beer
session
taste
initially
of
lemon
but
soon
the
alcohol
began
to
overpower
this
citrus

offering
this
330ml
bottle

been
aging
in
my
basement
for
about

just

am

the

in

proves
to
be

a

the
bartender
had
warned
me
that
the
beer
tended
to
be
a
little
flat
compared
to
the
bottle
version
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
this
keg
it
had
a
light
fee
in
the
mouth
with
some
nice
fizziness
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
if
not
excellent
draft
beer
if
it
had
not
been
10
5
i
would
have
gone
back
for
another
one
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
dies
off
into
a
rocky
shape
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
grassy
and
hoppy
with
some
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
very
strong
and
is
composed
of
peppery
spices
and
some
sweetness
the
flavor
seems
a
little
too
aggressive
for
my
tastes
compared
to
the
others
by
this
brewer
not
smooth
enough
to
thoroughly
enjoy
drinkability
i
got
this
as
a
belated
yen
from
talk
like
a
pirate
day
wish
i
had
had
it
then
its
not
a
bad
drink
its
got
some

interesting
beer
a
warming
afterglow
taste
smoothes
with
time
imho
an
enjoyable
brew
but
its
intensity
overwhelms
the
drinkability
and
it
is
lacking
in
a
wellbalanced
character
somewhat
twodimensional
a
very
sweet
start
and
a
very
dry
finish
its
got
a
crisp
hop
bite
with
a
sweet
flavor
sort
of
spicy
and
an
excellent
aftertaste
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
prevailancy
of
the
sweeter
flavors
come
out
more
i
would
have
to
say
its
a
medium
to
fullbodied
beer
with
a
thick
finish
definately
a
must
try
and
then
try
it
again
just
to
make
sure
this
beers
appearance
is
totally
awesome
rich
thick
billowy
creamy
plumes
of
white
froth
top
this
little
beauty
the
head
lasts
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
and
laces
in
a
way
not
often
seen
in
many
beers
the
foam
imparts
a
very
sweet
flavor
followed
by
the
deliciousness
of
the
amberhued
body
the
flavor
is
indeed
complex
giving
the
impression
of
many
different
foods
in
there
are
raisins
and
plums
a
little
spice
some
herbal
hops
and
fruit
from
the
vine
unbelievably
late
in
the
glass
the
smell
of
pure
honey
begins
to
emerge
and
mask
the
malty
goodness
truly
a
lovely
feel
and
great
drinkability
complex
this
is
definately
a
solid
4
0er
its
got
a
beautiful
rich
head
that
lasted
forever
that
is
one
of
my
biggest
things
its
gotta
have
a
good
head
to
even
begin
to
get
somewhere
with
me
here
it
is
like
15
minutes
after
i
poured
it
and
the
head
still
thick
and
frothy
i
guess
the
only
bad
thing
about
the
appearance
is
the
fruity
looking
pirate
on
the
bottle
with
a
viking
ship
whats
up
with
that
oh
well
guess
you
cant
have
everything
the
taste
was
a
nice
complexion
of
various
fruits
ie
citrus
and
grapes
mixed
with
maltiness
it
also
had
to
presence
of
alcohol
but
i
dig
that
the
smell
was
similar
but
still
had
the
alchololiness
to
it
its
cheap
so
i
think
i
could
drink
this
some
more
arrr
shiver
me
timbers
a
top
tier
triple
in
my
book
poured
out
a
golden
wheat
like
color
smell
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
yeast
overtone
taste
is
complex
with
the
fruity
hints
melding
with
clove
and
honey
a
little
hop
kick
in
the
end
quite
drinkable
despite
the
abv
one
of
the
best
triples
ive
tasted
to
date
just
delicious
it
drinks
pretty
well
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
session
if
just
feels
a
bit
heavy
even
though
it
looks
light
this
belgian
ale
poured
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
white
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
and
left
lace
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
candy
sugar
citrus
and
hints
of
fruit
flavors
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
the
characteristic
belgian
ale
tangy
flavor
there
were
also
hints
of
fruit
figs
and
raisins
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
airy
on
the
tongue
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
feel
low
the
finish
and
aftertaste
were
slightyl
hoppy
this
was
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
strong
ale
deceptively
easy
to
drink
poured
a
hazy
darkorange
with
a
large
creamywhite
head
smells
of
yeast
and
alcohol
and
clove
bubbly
on

present
and
not

hidden
i
drank
all
11
2
oz
but
ones
enough
for
me
this
brew
pours
a
large
head
of
fine
and
medium
sized
white
bubbles
with
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
body
its
aroma
is
very
mild
indeed
buit
from
what
i
could
smell
of
it
nice
in
a
malty
banana
way
the
flavor
is
powerful
and
well
backed
by
its
105
abv
it
has
acomplex
flavor
that
includes
nots
of
bread
citrous
spice
malt
and
maybe
a
few
other
things
it
doesnt
take
long
for
the
alcohol
to
hit
you
either
this
is
a
powerful
complex
brew
poured
a
medium
offwhite
creamy
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
this
brew
had
a
clove
aroma
to
it
the
body
was
cloudy
and
it
was
golden
in
hue
with
some
carbonation
observed
i
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
wow
the
lacing
was
fair
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
there
is
a
strong
bitter
taste
that
lingers
with
this
brew
this
is
definitely
a
brew
to
be
sipped
and
not
guzzled
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
good
buzz
pours
nicely
medium
golden
clear
yellow
no
cloudiness
unless
you
swirl
the
very
last
bit
very
clean
smelling
somewhat
tart
apple
or
grape
can
also
smell
the
alchohol
i
drank
this
fairly
warm
taste
also
had
some
good
fruit
taste
backed
by
some
malt
not
quite
a
tripel
warm
to
the
tummy
mouthfeel
was
numbing
and
oily
i
have
had
this
before
and
will
have
again
very
tasty
beer
but
i
prefer
duvelfor
the
type
nice
looking
beer
faded
amber
in
color
30
head
in
off
white
lace
was
not
as
rich
as
i
expected
as
far
as
drinking
ive
got
to
say
that
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
better
than
its
taste
and
that
knocked
the
drinkability
down
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
coulda
been
a
contenda
pours
a
rather
dark
golden
color
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
make
of
this
beer
from
the
get
go
it
has
a
wacky
looking
label
with
really
no
description
of
the
contents
inside
so
naturally
it
was
time
for
an
adventure
piraat
overall
is
a
very
drinkable
trippel
that
leans
more
towards
the
dark
trippel
side
my
main
complaints
about
it
is
that
its
10
5
abv
is
very
apparent
lacking
a
real
balance
additionally
it
is
very
malty
which
if
you
like
that
sorta
thing
is
fine
many
do
not
however
i
was
not
disappointed
in
my
purchase
however
my
aroma
was
a
nice
mix
of
lemon
with
phenolclove
spiciness
big
full
head
active
bubble
action
from
the
bottom
some
lacing
mine
was
less
cloudy
than
others
have
described
rather
bright
gold
color
flavor
is
explosive
and
intense
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
as
beer
flavor
goes
taste
of
alcohol
is
present
throughout
and
lingers
good
mix
of
flavors
with
malt
spices
some
mild
fruitiness
and
a
shot
of
bitterness
too
intensity
of
the
drink
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
but
a
nice
ale
smoothness
helps
it
go
down
more
easily
some
mild
carbonation
action
with
the
drink
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
including
the
goofy
picture
on
the
bottle
taste
is
quite
strong
of
alcohol
with
a
lemonyorange
spice
and
a
bit
of
a
nutlike
malt
very
milky
grainy
pulpy
in
the
feel
with
a
smooth
alcoholic
bite
that
cleansed
my
head
drink
this
bad
boy
pirate
slowly
pours
a
solid
orange
color
with
an
ultrathin
offwhite
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
spices
with
a
faint
skunky
presence
here
and
there
flavor
is
almost
dominated
by
the
alcohol
but
there
are
nice
malt
and
grapefruit
flavors
apparent
as
well
overall
not
a
bad
experience
but
this
beer
isnt
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
belgians
i
have
had
pat
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
though
definatly
not
a
session
beer
i
had
it
for
desert
and
i
would
do
so
again
this
beer
is
a
rich
golden
color
and
is
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
there
is
a
slight
haze
to
the
beer
as
well
the
aroma
is
light
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
mostly
a
malt
sweetness
coupled
with
a
strong
alcohol
note
there
is
a
decent
hops
bittering
in
the
finish
but
this
is
all
about
sweet
fruity
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
good
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
was
an
ipa
it
is
a
very
good
beer
that
malt
lovers
will
enjoy
first
bottle
in
my
valentine
6
pack
sampler
was
this
offering
a
pirate
beer
golden
color
with
a
good
head
the
hops
were
outstanding
it
head
a
spice
perhaps
cloves
that
was
odd
at
first
but
grew
on
me
as
i
continued
drinking
excellent
beer
well
worth
it
a
very
good
brew
i
will
thoroughly
enjoy
this
one
its
taste
is
very
fruity
with
a
touch
of
clove
the
estery
essance
is
also
present
here
in
the
same
way
as
duvel
i
have
to
say
its
not
impressing
me
overly
much
but
its
still
a
good
and
complex
brew
very
spicy
first
sip
cloves
are
most
dominant
much
drier
than
i
was
expecting
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
you
know
its
there
but
you
can
barely
taste
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
nicely
so
very
well
balanced
left
a
lingering
lace
on
my
glass
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
slightly
creamy
and
excellently
carbonated
way
to
drinkable
for
10
5
abv
mouthwatering
nose
of
melons
and
lime
in
a
burlap
bag
that
once
transported
peppercorns
starts
sugary
but
the
sweets
are
soon
snagged
up
by
a
brutal
alcohol
bully
and
his
sadistic
hop
sidekick
theyre
ruffians
sure
but
troubled
youth
always
has
a
softer
edge
that
warms
ones
soul
deep
toasted
golden
fields
under
fleecy
clouds
edging
a
spritzy
river
of
carbonation
thats
quick
yet
mellow
and
my
mind
lazed
back
for
a
picnic
lunch
of
piraat
simply
put
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
of
the
tripel
style
wow
this
beer
is
a
treat
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
beware
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
might
be
nuts
but
the
first
impression
in
the
aroma
department
was
of
baked
beans
after
a
few
minutes
the
yeasty
clove
accented
smell
came
through
a
very
impressive
head
adorned
a
hazy
golden
liquid
as
expected

was
plentiful
i
have
tried
to
get
in
to
belgians
and
i
think
i
can
take
em
or
leave
em
this
one
was
my
favorite
of
the
three
i
have
tried
i
know
thats
not
a
big
sample
but
i
really
think
they
are
not
for
me
this
was
a
good
brew
though
and
i
liked
it
more
than
this

on
surprising

shiver
me
timbers
you
scurvy
dog
the
bottle
says
ale
but
i
have
to
catagorize
this
as
a
belgian
triple
big
alcohol
in
the
beginning
as
well
as
the
end
alcohol
nose
overwhealming
the
spices
very
little

but
somewhat
intrigueing
keeps
you
coming
back
spices
are
there
but
you
have
to
seek
to
find
the
hidden
treasure
sorry
about
that
with
all
the
belgians
out
there
i
would
look
for
something
different
before
i
would
try
another
330
like
most
belgium
beers
ive
tried
the
smell
and
apperance
are
great
then
its
down
hill
from
there
but
this
beer
after
a
few
sip
got
better
it
has
a
fruity
aroma
and
taste
not
real
bitter
on
the
after
taste
flavorful
as
you
drink
this
brew
and
it
grows
on
you
after
each
sip
or
gulp
one
of
the
better
belgium
beers
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
winter
afternoon
infact
anytime
when
i
first
had
this
beer
compared
with
duvel
lucifer
and
a
few
of
the
other
more
balanced
strong
golden
belgians
i
found
it
to
be
aggressive
and
rough
with
a
bold
sweetness
an
apparent
alcohol
and
a
rough
edge
of
bitterness
and
acidity
ive
since
changed
my
opinion
on
that
in
so
far
as
those
qualities
give
it
a
bold
unique
character
there
are
times
when
you
want
something
that
will
reach
out
and
grab
you
this
is
it
beautiful
deep
gold
with
a
bright
white
rocky
head
that
holds
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
that
caresses
and
tingles
the
aroma
is
huge
complex
fruity
spicy
and
sweetly
malty
the
flavor
starts
with
a
bright
sweet
malt
revealing
some
spice
coriander
and
light
acidity
followed
by
a
brash
bitterness
plenty
of
alcohol
here
a
very
strong
highly
flavored
ale
that
tours
your
mouth
and
takes
no
prisoners
deep
gold
with
fruity
aroma
and
taste
think
i
noticed
some
honey
flavor
in
there
as
well
medium
bodied
and
very
strong
this
one
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
from
you
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
though
love
this
beer
especially
nice
on
a
cold
winters
day
has
a
huge
head
and
hoppy
aroma
the
alcohol
is
very
noticable
from
the
first
sip
but
you
adjust
to
it
after
a
couple
of
sips
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
if
youre
looking
to
have
a
great
tripel
its
worth
trying
careful

beer
to
me
but
it
didnt
have

characteristics
that
are

me

this

triplestrength

a
powerful

punch
with
a
mild

yeast
flavor
brings
to
mind
bread
dough
spices
and
tropical
fruits
quite
drinkable
but
the
nose
and
the
palate
have
too
much
alcohol
on
them
its
ok
though
and
a
great
way
to
get
drunk
this
can
be
good
or
bad
anyway
not
the
best
belgian
beer
i
recently
had
piraat
on
draught
and
am
raising
the
results
of
my
review
as
a
result
i
found
that
the
alcohol
didnt
dominate
the
flavor
as
is
it
did
from
the
bottle
i
also
noticed
some
subtle
flavors
that
werent
so
detectable
in
the
bottle
beautiful
hazy
golden
beer
nice
and
floral
on
the
nose
nice
sweetness
that
covers
the
high
alcohol
of
the
beergreat
balance
and
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
tastes
wheaty
at
first
then
the
hops
then
the
sweet
maltyness
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
as
a
side
note
i
won
6
piraat
glasses
from
global
beer
a
long
time
ago
and
was
delighted
to
finally
fill
one
of
those
vessels
with
the
correct
nectar
food
match
ibuprofen
panadol
and
aspirin
pick
your
poison
or
cheese
platter
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
heres
to
life
o
mellowed
as
it
went
on
but
not
a
subtle
beer
i
would
describe
this
as
belgiums
equivalent
of
special
brew
i
think
ill
put
the
remaining
3
bottles
away
and
hope
that
age
calms
them
this
poured
a
translucent
copper
colour
and
produced
a
thin
white
ring
of
head
the
nose
leads
with
toffee
and
malt
there
is
a
sweet
fruitiness
as
well
along
with
dates
and
dark
fruit
the
flavour
is
much
of
the
same
along
with
an
alcohol
warmness
not
the
burn
that
you
might
expect
with
a
11

abv
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
but
that
adds
to
the
experience
because
the

it

was
an
outstanding
beer
with
plenty
going

overall
a
very
well
balanced

the

and
the

doesnt

quaffable

not
chuggable
do
not
limit
this
to

only
this
has
just
hit
the
list
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
nothing
negative
to
say
about
this
beer
i
will
buy
again
a
worry
free
sipper
that
allows
for
pure
enjoyment
if
you
take
your
time
unlike
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
in
your
face
bigger
fig
and
prune
notes
the
maltyness
is
prominent
with
a
slight
and
i
mean
slight
alcohol
in
the
back
a
classic
belgian
strong
amber
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
the
most
impressive
thing
about
it
is
the
feel
and
how
well
it
hides
its
intense
alcoholic
strength
its
barley
there
not
the
least
bit
hot
and
rather
smooth
drinking
as
a
result
slightly
hazy
orangey
amber
in
color
with
a
patchy
white
head
that
lasts
i
smell
a
lot
of
residual
sugar
here
sweet
dusty
almost
english
type
grain
on
this
with
a
robust
belgian
yeast
strain
that
gives
off
some
dried
apricot
notes
and
maybe
even
a
little
apple
the
sweetness
is
there
but
its
short
lived
the
finish
is
still
pretty
quick
on
it
and
the
big
carbonation
makes
it
drink
a
little
cleaner
too
i
like
the
elegant
simplicity
of
this
beer
despite
also
being
dynamic
and
very
strong
it
comes
across
well
refined
and
completely
dialed
in
they
do
a
refermented
in
the
bottle
addition
of
this
which
i
have
to
imagine
is
even
more
enjoyable
with
the
rest
of
its
sugar
gone
but
i
like
the
little
brother
edition
here
definitely
an
underrated
brew
odnot
something
i
would
ever
buy
happy
i
didnt
pay
for
this
and
i
sampled
from
a
friend
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
but
i
can
see
why
someone
who
loves
their
belgian
sweetbrews
would
love
its
hot
sticky
goodness
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naplesflorida
for
15
99
for
a
4
pk
o
the
best
belgian
beer
i
have
had
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
glass
the
appearance
was
okay
nothing
special
but
also
not
bad
the
taste
was
not
good
in
my
opinion
not
balanced
too
heavy
alcohol
taste
for
my
taste
very
strong
sweetness
the
beer
was
nice
and
thick
though
overall
not
bad
but
also
not
great
o
must
try
this
one
noted
for
its
alcohol
presence
but
is
a
good
belgian
as
well
a
little
too
much
alcohol
for
my
liking
but
i
love
its
uniqueness

with

o
the
ideal
sipper
to
relax
with
at
the
end
of
the
day
afterall
a
good
special
strong
pale
ale
from
dubuisson
bush
ambrée
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
to
have
with
food
bitter
sweet
and
rich
beers
work
well
with
more
complex
food
profiles
salty
foods
in
general
is
something
i
would
suggest
serving
type
bottle
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
the
flavor
of
this
belgian
is
malty
with
tropical
yeast
which
has
a
ripe
banana
element
with
slight
spice
almost
peppery
but
still
has
a
mild
caramel
flavor
with
gentle
sugary
background
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
not
in
an
offensive
way
just
adds
to
the
complexity
with
some
woody
hop
and
mild
citrus
elements
in
the
peripheral
taste
i
am
not
sure
why
i
passed
on
this
before
it
is
a
festive
beer
that
i
could
have
shared
but
i
am
glad
i
didnt
the
overall
drinkability
for
a
beer
this
strong
is
exceptional
it
is
pretty
warming
but
that
is
part
of
the
charm
since
the
malt
flavor
and
obvious
candy
sugar
usage
are
utilized
so
well
overall
a
solid
strong
ale
but
would
taste
better
with
less
booziness
overall
this
is
closer
to
a
finishing
brandy
or
a
barelywine
than
a
beer
wish
i
had
more
to
say
about
this
as
it
received
some
great
reviews
from
others
and
i
want
to
like
it
but
the
alcohol
dominates
mouth
feel
is
rich
thick
and
solid
as
you
would
expect
with
such
a
high
gravity
beer
full
semi
sweet
luscious
and
frothy
as
the
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
this
is
what

pa
but
far
from
the
best
its
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
satisfying
but
not
necessarily
extremely
memorable
omy
expectations
of
a
simple
highly
boozy
pale
ale
were
met
here
the
flavors
are
not
bad
but
are
mostly
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
which
leaves
you
with
a
sweet
sortof
cough
syruplike
approximation
of
a
pale
ale
i
wont
go
searching
for
this
brew
again
but
it
was
not
terrible
by
any
means
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
yeast
fruits
and
grape
juice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
and
makes
the
flavor
a
bit
abrasive
o
packs
a
punch
without
being
too
overwhelming
certainly
a
sipper
but
is
refined
enough
to
greatly
appreciate
this
beer
takes
the
strong
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
to
heart
it
is
much
stronger
than
other
beers
of
this
style
and
therefore
has
some
traits
that
i
havent
seen
in
similar
beers
some
will
be
put
off
by
this
beers
strength
but
if
that
doesnt
bother
you
it
is
a
fine
beer
to
slowly
enjoy
o
off
balance
as
it
falls
into
the
pits
of
becoming
a
liquor
the
warming
of
the
liquor
didnt
help
the
tastes
which
were
hard
to
get
into
the
mouth
because
of
the
burning
eyes
at
12
the
alcohol
is
wacky
but
nothing
i
havent
seen
before
heavy
handed
which
leaves
the
brew
rather
a
novelty
instead
of
a
drinkable
delight
o
this
beer
is
rather
sweet
more
so
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
not
cloying
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
in
the
tastesmellmouthfeel
enjoyable
but
definitely
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
over
a
couple
of
hours
this
would
be
perfect
to
sip
in
front
of
the
fireplace
with
a
nice
cigar
on
a
cold
winter
evening
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
has
a
real
weak
body
that
doesnt
seem
to
carry
the
palates
flavors
it
feels
lighter
than
12
abv
but
does
come
off
just
a
little
boozy
and
tasteless
its
ok
but
i
dont
think
its
also
very
easy
to
drink
or
enjoy
pours
out
a
semi
dark
copper
color
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
could
float
a
anvil
the
head
is
an
off
white
color
and
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
and
is
accompanied
by
some
good
lacing
the
floating
fermentation
looks
very
inviting
the
aroma
is
rather
light
but
very
complex
theres
plenty
of
yeast
dark
fruits
esters
caramel
fig
mild
grape
and
malts
in
the
smell
it
has
a
much
lighter
body
than
you
would
expect
very
drinkable
but
still
on
the
lighter
side
of
being
medium
bodied
oddly
enough
all
of
these
flavors
blend
together
into
one
wave
that
just
slowly
rides
over
the
tongue
no
cloying
sweetness
crisp
finish
with
a
dash
of
medicinal
herbs
mixed
in
this
beer
is
just
simply
incredible
in
its
subtlety
and
complexity
d
a
sipper
o
really
poor
drinkability
because
of
the
overpowering
alcohol
it
really
spoiled
my
tasting
fortunately
aromas
are
exceptional
and
bring
this
brew
above
the
average
3
55
o
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
and
makes
for
a
good
choice
to
finish
the
night
with
it
almost
seems
like
a
hybrid
between
a
whiskey
and
a
beer
oreally
balanced
and
flavorful
exceptional
for
the
alcohol
content
o
great
beer
belgian
to
the
bone
i
would
give
this
a
five
but
i
believe
it
was
expired
can
someone
explain
how
to
read
the
expiration
thanks
okay
ill
write
more
i
love
the
little
bottle
love
that
it
is
from
belgium
i
love
that
is
12
percent
alcohol
it
looked
nice
in
a
glass
the
smell
was
wonderful
fruity
the
expiration
is
impossible
for
me
to
read
i
think
it
actually
from
10
if
so
it
was
still
amazing
wife
asked
why
there
was
stuff
floating
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
it
was
expired
it
was
still
drinkable
overall
holy
booze
this
beer
might
need
some
age
to
tone
down
the
alcohol
flavour
still
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
not
something
id
grab
again
its
basically
like
a
barley
wine
but
without
the
sweetness
b
incredible
incredible
brew
d
this
is
a
pretty
intense
beer
alcohol
and
sugar
battle
it
out
for
twelve
rounds
with
sugar
winning
by
decision
this
8
oz
bottle
is
the
perfect
serving
size
for
this
potent
beast
as
any
more
would
be
a
bit
too
much
having
a
tulip
with
a
025l

makes
it

a

but
nothing
really
outstanding
o
good
but
pretty
intense
and
not
for
regular
drinking
o
incredible
for
alcohol
overall
while
this
bottle
is
i
suspect
quite
a
few
years
beyond
the
best
by
date
it
is
still
drinking
very
nicely
and
as
others
have
noted
takes
on
barleywinelike
characteristics
o
good
but
kind
of
weird
in
a
way
i
cant
put
into
words
easily
it
has
all
of
the
makings
of
a
good
beer
of
the
style
but
it
was
missing
balance
or
something
doa
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
all
of
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
even
the
very
noticeable
alcohol
presence
seemed
to
fit
well
into
the
flavor
nice
enough
to
the
eye
but
makes
very
little
effort
to
appeal
to
the
other
vital
senses
dull
notes
i
was
expecting
less
so
this
was
definitely
a
surprise
none
of
the
astringent
notes
i
found
in
other
bushscaldis
offerings
and
instead
a
rather
assertive
but
enticing
brew
nothing
to
make
a
milestone
of
but
rather
notable
old
aleish
at
points
even
english
barleywine
with
some
central
european
hints
drinkability
this
definitely
gets
two
thumbs
up
but
i
now
understand
why
it
is
offered
in
250
ml
bottles
though
it
is
very
well
masked
the
alcohol
is
still
potent
poured
a
2
beige
head
with
decent
retention
body
is
a
cross
between
golden
yellow
and
amber
and
held
to
the
light
it
shows
clouding
from
fine
particulates
smell
is
really
good
with
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
rich
with
malt
caramel
and
toffee
and
its
creamy
and
sweet
theres
a
mediumlong
finish
which
feels
like
you
just
ate
a
sweet
dessert
good
stuff
scaldis
is
roughly
what
i
expected
altogether
a
beer
with
good
flavor
and
a
great
amount
of
heat
more
of
a
digestif
than
a
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
from
a
personal
standpoint
the
presence
of
the
belgian
funk
common
with
belgian
yeast
is
barely
there
which
is
a
good
thing
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
beer
that
i
would
not
only
drink
again
but
recommend
my
sorta
brew
o
the
balance
is
off
in
this
beer
its
not
going
to
be
something
i
drink
often
o
overall
a
belgium
of
the
bat
perfectly
subtle
and
spiced
perfect
cant
wait
to
drink
my
noel
a
quality
brew
but
not
to
my
taste
just
too
sweet
overall
decent
nice
malts
and
hint
of
hops
a
bit
on
the
hot
and
boozy
side
but
expected
for
12
scaldis
is
strong
and
solid
but
not
that
impressive
in
the
end
overall
this
was
a
surprise
i
thought
it
was
a
quad
if
it
is
it
would
have
to
be
like
a
golden
quad
as
it
has
none
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
of
a
typical
quad
its
pretty
nice
though
i
was
going
to
bitch
more
about
the
small
bottle
but
its
the
right
serving
size

this
and

very
flavorful
and
so
tasty
it
has
a
kinda
port
more
of
a
sipper
not
a
session
o
looks
great
smells
insanely
great
but
starts
falling
off
from
there
the
taste
is
good
but
not
like
the
nose
says
it
should
be
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
like
the
smell
thin
whimpy
and
a
bit
to
boozey
even
for
me
really
glad
i
tried
this
and
plan
to
get
more
to
stock
away
for
a
cold
wet
damp
rainy
day
next
to
the
fire
place
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
overall
def
worth
trying
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
though
a
nice
beer
but
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
while
drinking
this
you
can
tell
it
is
the
real
deal
this
was
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
but
i
would
consider
buying
it
again
after
a
few
tries
and
sips
i
threw
the
rest
away
the
flavors
are
creamy
so
it
only
makes
sense
that
the
mouthfeel
is
too
the
style
calls
for
more
carbonation
but
the
relative
lack
of
it
in
scaldis
makes
sense
overall
this
is
a
solid
aboveaverage
beer
it
is
too
unique
to
be
corralled
into
the
world
of
duvel
clones
its
a
belgian
strong
amber
ale
with
all
of
the
unique
flavors
that
would
come
from
such
an
imaginary
style
definitely
worth
a
try
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
bland
or
just
strong
tasting
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
foam
on
the
beer
was
somewhat
big
but
it
disapated
quickly
to
leave
just
a
thin
scattered
foam
on
top
of
a
medium
amber
colored
beer
that
i
poured
into
a
goblet
to
enjoy
i
thought
the
smell
was
clean
but
it
did
not
give
a
hint
of
the
nice
taste
of
the
beer
which
was
smooth
with
some
carbonation
with
some
hops
and
a
light
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
enjoying
causing
one
to
really
savor
the
taste
overall
bush
is
really
a
good
beer
and
i
hope
to
get
to
brussels
to
bring
more
home
if
only
the
smell
were
a
tick
more
pleasant
notes
awesome
beer
a
gargantuan
brew
that
is
delicate
and
complex
fruity
and
spicy
and
even
hoppy
as
well
as
amazingly
light
even
with
the
blatant
booziness
a
deft
hand
brews
this
bad
boy
overall
good
tasting
but
a
little
too
sweet

boozy
for
me

its

actually

a

the
only
bad
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
can
over
power
the
flavors
a
bit
at
times
but
the
flavors
do
shine
through
at
some
points
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
would
be
impossible
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
given
time
in
my
opinion
pretty
good
o
decent
beer
with
drinkability
not
as
smooth
as
would
have
liked
d
too
much
bitter
honey
in
its
taste
for
me
and
although
it
rather
smooth
even
with
the
noticeable
alcohol
a
couple
of
these
would
be
too
much
for
most
drinkabilityworth
13
much
past
that
and
it
wont
matter
solid
beer
but
not
exceptional
while
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
belgium
has
far
more
to
offer
drinkability
is
not
great
but
thats
somewhat
expected
for
such
a
strong
style
the
almonds
notes
were
not
appealing
to
me
d
very
delectable
but
at
12
how
many
can
one
have
this
is
a
tastey
beer
but
on
the
downside
it
leaves
a
heavy
sugary
aftertaste
which
drags
the
drinkability
factor
down
d
big
sweet
and
boozy
makes
it
tough
to
have
more
than
one
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
d
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
its
a
strong
one
and
you
can
taste
that
along
with
all
the
other
complex
layers
of
this
delightful
beer
enjoy
very
enjoyable
strong
ale
mighty
at
12
abv
a
great
sipper
not
something
you
would
gulp
or
session
though
id
like
to
have
it
again
jd
in
small
doses
however
this
is
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
m
d
mediumheavy
with
a
viscous
feel
the
alcoholic
strength
will
moderate
the
pace
of
consumption
for
most
d
one
of
the
belgiums
must
have
i
like
it
scaldis
is
a
beer
you
should
only
buy
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
its
very
expensive
i
think
i
got
four
250ml
bottles
for
around
16
possibly
more
and
its
also
very
distinctive
if
you
want
the
burn
of
hard
liquor
and
some
whiskey
reminiscent
flavor
profiles
along
with
subtle
belgian
yeast
and
hops
and
some
big
bready
malt
this
beer
is
exactly
what
you
want
d
this
beer
delivers
on
what
is
promised
by
the
aromaa
big
boozy
celebration
of
malted
barley
it
proves
a
big
beer
doesnt
need
spices
or
fruit
to
make
a
statement
this
is
as
simple
and
direct
as
it
gets
i
wouldnt
advise
having
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
ill
take
it
any
day
as
a
substitute
for
brandy
or
an
afterdinner
liquor
by
the
fire
this
to
me
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
more
potent
trappist
beers
maybe
its
just
the
phenolic
overtones
but
this
tastes
to
me
more
like
a
triple
than
a
pale
ale
tricky
taste
to
unlock
but
well
worth
the
effort
now
if
only
this
was
a
mere
8
d
low
drinkability
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
but
i
must
give
it
a
4
because
its
delicious
i
could
definitelyobviously
not
session
with
it
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
the
one
im
drinking
the
taste
is
apricot
belgian
hops
and
malt
the
beer
is
rather
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
nice
mouth
feel
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
strong
one
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
reasonably
priced
as
well
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
the
small
pour
that
i
did
get
i
actually
had
to
share
to
finish
the
alcohol
just
strikes
me
as
too
poweful
i
dont
know
if
the
brewers
were
going
for
boozy
for
the
sake
of
boozy
just
to
lay
claim
to
the
title
of
strongest
beer
in
belgium
but
it
seems
that

outstanding
beer
in
my

one
of
the
best
references
for
a

blond
ale
as
other
dupont
it
is
intense
in
spices
complex
and
with
a
relatively
good
amount
of
herbal
hops
o
i
liked
the
sourness
i
find
the
sweetness
of
some
belgian
blondes
and
strong
ales
a
bit
off
putting
this
beer
is
more
tarty
than
others
with
a
similar
abv
but
the
crisp
finish
is
all
i
remember
the
spiciness
is
potent
which
im
not
fully
sold
on
very
enjoyable
belgian
beer
this
one
was
reminiscent
of
a
saison
early
on
and
not
being
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
i
was
initially
worried
but
the
funk
tart
and
belgian
yeast
died
down
some
and
the
fruit
flavours
and
spice
slowly
took
over
the
beer
was
a
well
balanced
some
and
despite
the
alcohol
content
it
still
managed
to
go
down
easily
while
its
not
a
beer
that
id
go
back
to
time
and
again
i
would
definitely
consider
trying
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
o
granted
this
is
not
technically
in
the
same
style
but
i
might
prefer
this
to
their
classic
saison
dupont
this
is
just
so
wonderfully
dry
balanced
and
layered
flavors
that
would
make
this
ideal
to
have
bottles
around
when
grilling
in
the
backyard
in
summer
time
must
try
along
with
all
great
belgians
absolutely
lovely
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
good

carbonation
on
it
o
pretty
good
beer
could
use
a

and
carbonation
o
has
some
great
elements

the
weird

flavor
is
overall
dupont
always
manage
to
come
up
with

stuff
and
this
is
no
exception
ive
got
a

of
it

its
not
going
to
last
me
half
as
long
as
id
like
it
to
the

side
is
going

this
winter
o
a
very
drinkable
and
flavourful
brew
keeps
to
the
tenets
of
the
style
would
love
to
have
a
brew
like
this
on

heavy
side
of
light

creamy

and
mouthfeel
this

really
nicely
belgian
brews
are
so
hit
and
miss
for
me
this
one
was
definetely
good
worth
trying
ooutstanding
ale
with
great
flavors
and
balance
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
dont
be
fooled
by
the
blonde
ale
on
the
labelthis
is
anything
but
your
run
of
the
mill
bland

ale

pulled
the
cork
from

found
that

it
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
has
held
up
after
almost
7
years
it
opened
with
a
fairly
loud
pop
it
pours
a
fairly
clear
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much

aroma
is
good

a
bit
subdued
definitely
yeasty
and
bready

lighter

this
beer
is
nice
to
drink

more
carbonation
would
have
really
helped
out
the
brett
flavor
carries
the
beer
as
the
rest
is
pretty
light
i
was
surprised
at
the
taste
when
i
pulled
the
cork
and
saw
it
was
a
2009
overall
very
good
bright
and
citrussy
with
an
astringent
finish
that
makes
this
very
refreshing
a
good
food
beer
another
winner
from
dupont
o
i
consider
this
beer
a
very
strong
saison

it

the

do
really
an
all

great

the

certainly
a
strong
blonde

its
also
boarding

o
this
beer
is
about
100
times
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be

i

good
but
i
wasnt

i
would
think
so
highly
of
it
bravo
moinette
im
going
to
become
a
regular
drinker
of
this

overall
amazing

easily
the
star

awesome

it
is
a

a
wonderful
companion
with

turn
into
a

highly
drinkable

this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
consider
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
luckily
it
is
easily
found
here
in
maine
so
i
can
get
a
bottle
nearly
any
time
i
want
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
it
is
recommended
o
a
very
drinkable
belgian
blonde
ale
a
little
spicy
good
o
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
nice
to
have
it
on
tap
at
sycamore
overall
surprising
but
very
enjoyable
ill
definitely
order
this
one
again
and
will
surely
review
my
tasting
with
more
experience
i
would
however
give
preference
to
a
chouffe
over
this
one
overall
the
carbonation
level
was
very
very
high
the
beer
made
my
mouth
tingle
the
flavours
are
not
subtle
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
definitely
an
above
average
beer
that
warrants
trying
at
least
once
overall
what
a
beer
will
buy
again
od
seems
like
theres
too
much
spice
and
yeast
mixed
together
for
my
tastes
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
cant
really
enjoy
this
too
much
a
classy
and
characterful
belgian
ale
with
a
fruity
overtone
with
balance
of
spice
and
herbs
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
quentessential
of
well
made
belgian
ales
o
this
stuff
is
dangerously
sessionable
for
the
abv
feels
quite
basic
but
is
just
delicious
gets
better
as
it
warms

moinette
blonde
proves
to
be
a
very
tasty
belgian
pale
ale
with
great
strength

and
body
was
not
expecting
the
hop
presence
to
be
so
strong
reccommended
if
you
like
your
belgian
pales
and
goldens
dry
then
drink
this
beer
its
a
classic
classic
the
only
thing
holding
its
drinkability
back
is
the
abv
totally
delicious
awesome
stuff
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
should
i
run
into
it
o
very
nice
i
really
love
duponts
beers
and
this
one
is
also
very
enjoyable
o
fairly
complex
bordering
on
saison
but
not
as
bitter
worth
the
drink
this
was
a
great
pale
ale
with
a
twist
big
abv
and
flavors
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
would
like
to
have
a
bottle
or
two
around
the
house
worth
a
try
not
many
people
are
buying
this
at
my
liquor
store
so
we
put
it
on
clearance
a
shame
pours
pale
gold
with
a
towering
growing
head
nose
shows
light
fruit
mainly
lemon
pears
and
green
apples
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
mixing
with
spicy
phenols
flavours
are
not
so
great
quite
sweet
at
first
with
more
light
fruit
and
candi
sugar
along
with
a
doughy
yeast
character
then
the
booze
creeps
through
and
mixes
with
a
sharp
bitterness
to
create
a
slightly
offputting
finish
carbonation
is
too
high
o
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
due
to
its
dryness
and
strength
although
the
alcohol
is
mostly
masked
from
the
taste
a
strong
pale
ale
or
a
saison
i
would
say
the
second
sure
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
will
become
my
goto
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
class
of
the
style
sampled
sofar
o
very
complex
and
well
done
strong
pale
ale
the
smell
exceeds
expectations
and
perhaps
causes
the
taste
to
be
a
little
disappointing
however
the
taste
is
great
and
mouthfeel
is
beautiful
this
is
a
wellbalanced
and
delicious
brew
o
very
nice
blonde
da
definitive
example
of
the
style
not
to
be
missed
d
medium
an
enjoyable
enough
strong
belgian
pale
ale
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
with
the
alcohol
just
percolating
under
the
surface
i
would
imagine
that
this
would
be
an
agreeable
way
to
see
the
sights
and
get
high

hainaut

blasted
in

this
a
dangerous
brew
quite
a
well
made
brew
i
initially
tried
this
beer
straight
from
my
frig
doesnt
smell
strong
smelled
like
belgian
sweetness
my
first
impression
of
it
was
fine
but
it
got
way
better
as
it
warmed
up
i
thought
it
was
the
best
when
almost
room
temp
around
the
60
degree
ballpark
beer
is
sweet
and
light
in
body
heavily
carbonated
on
the
mouth
if
this
wasnt
on
the
best
of
belgium
list
i
wouldnt
have
bothered
its
nothing
special
its
a
moderately
dry
moderately
spicy
moderately
yeasty
moderate
beer
who
cares
highly
drinkable
and
would
pair
very
well
with
shellfish
or
fatty
white
fish
mackerel
snapper
halibut
etc
lacks
a
little
complexity
compared
to
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
e
g
those
by
de
dolle
but
still
an
exceptional
ale
a
unique
and
very
nice
beer
experience
pours
a
light
yelloworange
initial
hard
pour
yields
a
nice
tall
head
that
falls
down
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
pretty
diverse
with
citrus
lemon
grass
hay
and
some
earth
the
taste
really
brigs
head
components
to
life
and
integrates
it
all
quite
well
a
nice
bit
of
grassy
earth
is
carried
by
ample
carbonaion
and
results
in
a
moderately
dry
finish
drinks
quite
well
and
makes
an
excellent
choice
alone
or
with
a
good
number
of
foods
overall
good
it
seems
to
have
a
slight
lager
finish
this
is
a
definite
wheat
and
yeast
prominent
beer
dextremely
well
balanced
with
a
great
level

creating
an
extremely
tasty
beer

brings
notes

and
hints
of
funk
wow
give
me
more
drinkability
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
not
generally
a
style
i
typically
reach
for
but
im
enjoying
it
it
goes
pretty
good
with
his
warm
fall
evening
weve
got
lined
up
here
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
brew
again
though
i
do
admin
i
wouldnt
go
on
a
late
night
beer
run
just
to
score
some
i
can
think
of
a
few
american
breweries
that
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
bds

everything
i
ever
had
from

even

the

the

float
from

me
wish

was

10
for

what

d
i
dont

i
could
have
more
than
one
bottle
as
it
seems
like
it
would
cheapen
it
but
just
that
amount
seems
perfect
to
appreciate
has
a
bit
of
oomph
to
it
with
the

and
definitely
continues
to
have

even

enjoy
d
refreshing

delicious
with

although
higher
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer

nice
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
not
really
like
the
other
bspa
that
i
have
had
it
has
some
aspects
of
a
bspa
but
also
some
of
a
tripel
and
a
saison
well
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
fruity
flavors
not
amazing
or
stand
out
but
a
solid
beer
d
fantastic
beer
a
sip
draws
you
in
more
a
great
beer
to
welcome
the
coming
spring
reminds
me
that
there
is
more
than
the
soul
crushing
darkness
of
the
winter
months
out
there
another
winner
from
dupont
ideas
from
fellow
taster
d
fair
to
good
due
to
the
abv
which
is
well
hidden
but
still
at
8
5
is
still
up
there
and
the
relative
big
feel
as
well
3
5
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
strong
pale
very
strong
very
unique
very
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
earthy
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
bitter
earthy
character
thats
quite
genuine
and
well
integrated
with
the
basic
pale
malt
bill
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
light
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
traditional
belgian
pale
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
excellent
yeast
character
wonderful
bspa
but
a
little
less
interesting
than
either
the
duvel
or
the
delirium
tremens
moinette
is
more
subtle
very
drinkable
but
the
bold
mouthfeel
of
duvel
and
the
rich
flavors
of
the
delirium
are
both
more
muted
in
the
moinette
wonderful
beer
but
not
best
in
its
class
the
nose
is
floral
and
well
hopped
like
the
mouth
is
just
as
much
and
is
reminiscent
of
a
westmalle
triple
by
force
of
hops
used
several
varieties
are
probably
present
the
finish
is
dry
but
still
powerful
not
at
all
sweet
it
is
earthy
reminiscent
of
earth
roots
and
usually
hops
in
its
most
pure
apparence

a
thin
skin
of
bubbles
yeast
particulate
is
left
floating
in
the
beer
my
first
pour
from
a
330ml
bottle
was
slow
and
deliberate
and
left
vitrually
zero
head
the
second
bottle
i
aggressively
poured
and
got
the
small
head
but
also
all
the
yeast
either
way
i
was
not
impressed
much
more
impressive
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
departments
i
get
a
nice
spicey
aroma
of
cloves
pepper
and
other
yeasty
smells
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
with
the
same
charactoristics
excecpt
with
the
addition
of
some
yeast
esters
that
add
some
sweetness
and
fruit
flavors
no
sign
of
alcohol
in
either
aroma
or
flavor
medium
body
and
a
spritely
carbonation
the
bubbles
added
a
needed
lift
and
life
a
good
beer
but
when
it
is
compared
to
the
granddaddy
of
bspas
duvel
i
would
take
duvel
every
time
espiecially
when
duvel
is
5
cheaper
a
4pack
md
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
creamy
smooth
and
well
carbonated
drinkabilty
is
very
high
seeing
as
how
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
out
through
the
delicious
flavor
d
i
will
buy
this
again
and
will
enjoy
it
often
i
think
that
the
balance
on
this
beer
was
great
the
flavors
were
all
enjoyable
and
rich
but
the
beer
did
not
overpower
on
tap
at
the
olde
forge
in
lanesboroughmass
served
from
the
tap
in
a
goblet
type
belgian
glass
outstanding
beer
taste
reminded
me
of
nilla
wafers
this
is
an
absolute
highbrow
comparison
had
to
order
another
just
to
make
sure
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
again
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue

1
finger

belgian
yeast
clove
and

dominate
lacing
is

and
lingers
for
just
a
bit
worth
mentioning
is
that
i
swear
i
saw
a
dinosaur
silhouette
in
the
lacing
brachiosaurus
i
believe
allowed
the
beer
to
warm
to
desired
temperature
while
i
researched
the
name
of
the
dinosaur
that
i
saw
in
the
lacing
anywho
taste
is
all
that
and
a
bag
of
chips
amazing
masking
of
8

abv
sweet
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
dominates
the
taste
just
beautiful
simply
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
blond
ales
i
can
remember
trying
pick
it
up
if
you
get
the
chance
a
very
good
beer
overall
the
alcohol
comes
through
towards
the
end
but
is
not
overpowering
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
leads
to
trouble
since
its
light
and
tasty
and
has
8
5
abv
my
advice
is
pick
one
up
and
get
in
trouble
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
bspasaison
lots
of
subtle
complexities
something
that
i
would
recommend
thick
dense
head
that
leaves
great
chunky
lace
cloudy
and
orangeamber
the
aroma
is
earthy
grainy
and
dry
the
flavor
is
complex
smooth
and
light
some
sourness
but
there
is
a
solid
hop
kick
at
the
swallow
although
the
aftertaste
has
the
sourness
show
up
again
drinkability
a
great
beginning
belgian
for
the
uninitiated
as
for
belgian
lovers
its
still
very
nice
this
is
a
great
and
crisp
ale
but
the
funky
aroma
doesnt
go
along
with
the
taste
which
was
a
good
thing
smells
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
some
good
apple
and
pear
flavors
for
me
i
noticed
the
alcohol
in
this
but
it
wasnt
too
strong
i
also
pickedup
some
spice
in
this
overall
a
good
beer
not
my
thing
but
still
pretty
good
d
refreshing
for
the
summer
but
complex
and
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
anytime
medium
to
high
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
chalky
finish
couldnt
really
taste
the
alcohol
very
decent

man
this
was
a
heck
of
a
beer
to
start
the
night
with
not
much
else
i
drank
could
keep
up
with
it
big
spicy
vanilla
toasted
bread
rolls
with
citrus
zest
and
biting
hops
lots
going
on
and
compared
to
other
beglians
like
the
long
strange
tripel
from
boulevard
which
is
also
a
great
beer
i
had
afterward
the
flavors
are
very
rich
the
beer
doesnt
overpower
your
taste
buds
like
a
dipa
but
its
not
all
mellow
subtle
flavor
clearly
an
excellent
belgian

poured
from

bottle
this
experience
was
great
from
the
moment
the
top
came
off
immediately
i
noticed
big
floaters
and
a
lot
of
sediment
that
poured
from
the
bottle
theres
no
mistaking
that
this
is
bottle
conditioned
it
is
a
beautiful
tangerine
color
that
lets
plenty
of

through

wouldnt

it

to

but
it
does
so
with
a
delicate
touch
like
the
label
states
on
the
back
its
a
bit
fuller
and
sweeter
than
its
cousin
beer
which
i
assume
means
the
dupont
this
works
well
and
would
be
a
great
beer
with
some
good
grub
opinion
wow
now
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
i
am
pretty
surprised
how
the
brewer
got
such
a
contrast
in
the
hops
i
was
expecting
a
harsh
astringent
and
bitter
finish
by
the
middle
of
the
profile
but
the
malt
ends
up
winning
in
the
end
amazing
this
is
a

one
that
i
will
definitely
be

shows
further
lots

probaly
many

yes
this
is
a
great
beer
though
maybe
litle
bombastic
and
highly
fuelled
for
the
beertype
as
i
see
it
more
of
a
saison
then
a
blonde
beer
as
it
off
course
also
is
highly
enjoyable
brew
that
i
certainly
see
again
soon
great
to
just
sit
sip
and
enjoy
drinkability
as
said
before
something
needed
to
complete
this
beer
as
it
is
just
blah
one
thing
that
i
notice
is
the
beer
is
hot
a
very
noticeable
phenol
taste
more
then
i
expected
from
a
8
5
beer
really
reminds
me
of
wine
and
even
has
a
white
grape
essence
to
it
the
body
is
in
the
mid
range
and
the
taste
is
smooth
but
dry
overall
a
decent
beer
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
be
careful
a
wonderful
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
keeps
me
going
back
to
belgain
pale
ales
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
by
now
that
i
think
a
lot
of
moinette
blond
i
really
have
nothing
else
to
add
except
to
say
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
and
to
drink
what
else
brasserie
dupont
has
to
offer
pours
a
thick
yellowed
peach
hue
and
makes
a
dense
white
head
with
lots
of

aroma
is
a
musty
banana
with
a
subtle
hint
of
cloves
flavor
opens
with
some
bittering
and
a
peppery
spice
yeasty
banana
character
dominates
the
middle
and
there
is
a
bit
of
buttery
toffee
finishes
with
a
strong
peppery
bite
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
to
fully
body
and
a
slightly
sticky
finish
this
is
a
nice
offering
it
seems
to
deviate
a
bit
from
what
i
am
used
to
in
a
belgian
strong
pale
with
the
extreme
peppery
spice
but
i
like
it
i
would
try
again
but
sadly
i
have
but
this

a

this

an

i

more
than
one
or

i
thought
i
was
drinking

is
just
above

truly
a
wonderful

just
the
way
i
love
them
bottle
from
my
wife
for
my
birthday
here
goes
nice
milkyyellow
haze
in
the
glass
though
not
as
disgusting
as
that
sounds
smells
strong
of
a
wild
yeast
brew
kind
of
tangy
and
sour
taste
is
good
strong
belgian
ale
heavy
malt
and
high
gravity
there
is
a
sourness
to
this
beer
though
that
i
dont
care
for
too
much
kind
of
like
cantillon
only
not
as
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
nice
lots
of
bubble
but
not
overly
tinglysharp
this
is
a
good
brew
but
the
sourness
will
keep
me
away
330
ml
bottle
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
creamy
but
the
sharp
end
in
the
flavor
profile
keeps
it
from
being
really
drinkable
enjoy
the
little
blond
nun
makes
me
feel
good
with
this
beer
aroma
opens
with
thoughts
of
home
a
wood
stove
and
baking
apples
in
the
oven
very
nice
it
pours
delicately
with
a
straight
up
yellow
appearance
reminiscent
of
drying
straw
its
initial
taste
is
pleasant
but
with
strong
alcohol
remember
it
is
8

yikes
with
wheatiness
its
big
but
still
leaves
room
for
food
finish
is
hops
id
like
more
in
the
mouth
but
due
to
its
strength
its
quite
amazing
the
beer
feels
so
light
goes
down
easy
and
wakes
up
groggy
nice
lightmedium

that
made
it

terrific
and

impress
geeks
and
newbies
alike
not

either
much
to
like
from

whatever
try
it

it
this
beer
was
part
of
the
brasserie

and
dewulf
beer
dinner
at
monks
on
may
10th
moinette
literally
means
little
nun
a
play
on
not
paying
service
to
an
abbaye
its
aroma
opens
with
a
reminder
of
baked
apple
and
was
poured
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
very
little
head
retention
however
each
refill
from
a
pitcher
poured
more
carbonated
and
with
a
better
layer
of
disappearing
foam
tasting
notes
included
notions
of
high
alcohol
a
light
body
wheaty
a
great
and
enjoyable
beer
whos
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
amply
big
in
flavor
drinkability
extremely
high
but
watch
out
at
8
5
youd
better
watch
out
for
the
little
nuns
sneak
attack
a
pitted
crinkly
head
of
pure
white
foam
consisting
of
perfectly
round
and
uniform
spheres
fills
half
the
goblet
on
the
pour
this
is
just
really
nice
to
watch
as
it
subsides
to
a
quarterinch
collar
and
clings
soapily
atop
its
brilliant
bananayellow
liquid
in
the
sun
the
beer
absolutely
shimmers
with
golden
highlights
with
no
sediment
to
be
seen
floral
nosefeel
is
spoton
for
style
if
slightly
thin
overall
flowery
and
stemlike
smells
waft
from
the
goblet
warming
to
become
more
rustic
and
raw
as
of
straw
bales
and
wet
hair
the
flavors
are
anything
but
delicate
though
the
bitterness
is
almost
shocking
even
for
the
style
fierce
green
peppercorn
and
thyme
drying
out
over
a
minerallimestone
base
still
there
is
a
ricey
malt
character
to
be
found
in
here
somewhere
mouthfeel
is
strangely
sudsy
considering
the
lack
of
visible
carbonation
the
biting
bitterness
lasts
for
ages
in
the
aftertaste
and
sort
of
impedes
the
drinkability
my
tastebuds
are
getting
blasted
this
is
no
table
beer
very
muscular
even
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
from
dupont
not
as
good
as
duvel
in
the
strong
pale
ale
category
but
very
close
imo
my
3rd
dupont
brew
they
have
all
been
high
quality
much
props
to
them
drinkability
and
overall
what
a
nice
beer
truly
a
treat
to
enjoy
and
i
enjoyed
it
heartily
quite
taste
and
quite
drinkable
definitly
one
to
try
overall
impression
wow
impressive
belgian
beer
complex
well
crafted
tasty
cant
seem
to
make
complete
sentences
the
alcohol
stepped
right
on
top
of
me
im
a
bit
numb
after
a
half
glass
but
i
never
saw
it
coming
this
has
farmhouse
characteristics
but
uptown
refinement
i
guess
it
is
the
farmhouse
qualities
that
make
this
a
bspa
rather
than
a
tripel
with
which
i
think
it
shares
many
qualities
should
be
paired
with
a
fine
meal
or
snack
rather
than
on
its
own
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
this
wellhopped
spicy
belgian
pale
ale
was
an
excellent
pairing
with
a
dinner
of
grilled
beef
potatoes
and
seasoned
squashes
seductively
drinkable
and
able
to
hold
its
own
when
paired
with
seasoned
foods
ive
developed
a
real
liking
for
the
creations
from
brasserie
dupont
and
moinette
blond
is
no
exception
well
worth
the
money
tall
crispy
white
merengue
forms
over
honeycolored
liquid
the
aromas
are
heady
and
sweet
steeped
in
grassy
herbs
butter
mashed
nuts
and
ripe
pears
i
had
prepared
for
something
sweeter
in
taste
while
this
is
not
as
astringently
hopped
as
this
brewerys
famous
saison
it
is
quite
dry
big
broad
aerated
chunks
of
dry
biscuit
flavors
are
seasoned
with
roasted
yellow
resins
and
a
fleeting
whitefleshed
fruitiness
stony
earthiness
lingers
before
succumbing
to
finishing
flavors
of
bitter
raw
nutshells
nicely
framed
bitterness
one
of
the
driest
8
5
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
plowed
through
this
750ml
time
for
some
scordalia
tastes
big
and
wicked
and
funky
as
funky
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
as
ive
ever
had
like
a
sweeter
saison
sort
of
it
still
has
the
larger
hop
presence
and
general
funkiness
that
im
used
to
from
a
saison
but
with
a
greater
sweetness
i
dig
it
its
amazing
how
the
aroma
hints
at
lemon
and
spice
and
fruit
but
the
taste
is
all
grassiness
and
barnyard
funk
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
chunky
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
hebal
and
floral
spicy
peppery
and
somewhat
honeyish
a
very
nice
aroma
the
flavor
is
yeasty
and
spicy
with
an
herbal
phenolic
taste
very
drying
and
somewhat
alcoholic
it
is
mediumfull
in
body
a
very
good
brew
on
tap
at
monks
this
beer
is
served
in
a
tulip
its
body
has
a
peachgolden
color
and
a
tight
head
of
an
inch
has
average
retention
active
carbonation
the
initial
smells
are
of
spicy
phenols
pepper
and
sharp
citrus
or
corriander
below
these
lingers
a
muted
funk
smell
somewhat
moldy
somewhat
lactic
the
taste
is
very
clean
it
first
hits
with
a
dry
sweetness
and
some
sharp
sour
citrus
notes
of
lemon
maybe
ginger
these
quickly
back
off
as
the
spiciness
shows
finally
the
taste
and
aroma
of
hops
wrap
the
ending
together
and
give
a
long
satisfying
aftertaste
the
sweetsourspicyhoppy
combination
is
wonderfully
complex
and
quite
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
easy
to
love
a
great
beer
from

i

alcohol
taste
is

a

strong

damn
this
beer
has
a
bite
to
it
dry
and
bittersweet
fruitiness
alcohol
flavors
a
strident
bitterness
but
not
form
hops
as
far
as
i
can
tell
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
taste
but
it
dominates
the
palate
almost
like
campari
juniper
berries
spicy
clove
in
there
taste
is
nothing
like
the
smell
amazing
complexity
bitter
and
smooth
sweet
in
the
nose
and
dry
on
the
tongue
really
excellent
could
have
stood
to
be
aged
and
i
really
wasnt
expecting
that
from
this
brew
lingering
dry
btterness
stays
around
forever
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
and
it
has
definitely
peaked
my
interest
to
go
back
for
more
this
is
the
definition
of
drinkability
pours
a
very
clear
gold
color
it
is
well
carbonated
and
the
bubbles
that
dance
through
my
beer
support
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
spicy
and
aromatic
with
notes
of
grass
grain
alcohol
lemon
and
coriander
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
is
followed
by
a
sharp
astringency
and
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
mediumlight
on
the
palate
there
is
some
spiciness
her
though
it
is
not
as
complex
as
the
saison
dupont
my
tongue
picks
up
a
certain
lemony
acidity
that
makes
this
beer
quite
refreshing
there
is
a
nice
fruity
yeast
character
and
some
simple
straightforward
malted
grain
notes
this
beer
picks
up
more
sweetness
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
up
and
loses
its
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
brew
though
i
must
admit
that
i
prefer
the
saison
dupont
from
a
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
its
a
vibrant
gold
with
an
immense
white
head
that
ends
up
looking
like
the
top
of
a
laundry
load
the
smell
is
nicely
fruity
most
noticeably
apricot
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
balances
the
dry
fruitiness
the
taste
of
belgian
yeast
is
comforting
especially
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
it
goes
down
well
for
an
8
5
beer
very
creamy
head
on
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
body
with
some
glittering
reflects
the
smell
is
nice
yeasty
highly
citric
with
some
peaches
maybe
some
anice
cookies
grassy
apple
juice
and
figs
the
taste
is
sweet
and
strong
apple
cider
with
hints
of
sourness
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
very
full
and
round
mouthfeel
strong
and
enjoyable
i
could
open
one
after
another
of
these
incredible
beers
after
pouring
carefully
take
a
few
minutes
to
bask
in
the
gorgeous
golden
glow
of
this
glorious
beer
the
thick
head
gradually
dissipates
leaving
a
permanent
film
over
the
hazy
beer
and
lovingly
laces
the
glass
the
room
fills
with
a
fresh
floral
aroma
the
first
taste
is
so
complex
malts
hops
and
spices
all
distinct
yet
experienced
simultaneously
alcohol
is
present
but
welcome
this
beer
pairs
well
with
patience
be
sure
to
drink
with
enough
time
to
truly
appreciate
all
this
wonderful
brew
has
to
offer
11
2oz
bottle
with
rust
around
the
crown

when
i
pop
the
cap
lets
out
a
big

of
carbonation
so
i
think
it
was
sealed
properly

got
the

again
preferrably
a

oh
yeah
head
is
huge
and
even
but
with
a
very
uneven
slow
collapse
the
beer
is
almost
clear

with
an
orange
tinge
and
a
dark
yeast
pour

is
sticky

middle
a
little

finishes
nice
and
bitter
dry

alcohol
and
tangy
fruit
this
seems
to
be
apples
as
i
reflect
theres
a
very
bittersour
aftertaste
thats
almost
overwhelming
and
certainly
distracting
the
alcohol
is
not
all
that
well
hidden
though
it
tames
with
temperature
i
tried
this
the
other
day
at
my
friend
daves
house
from
a
fresh
750ml
green
glass
bottle
i
had
loved
the
moinette
rougebruin
that
we
had
on
tap
at
the
bier
circus
in
brussels
so
i
thought
that
this
would
be
good
too
and
it
is
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
foam
that
lasts
and
provides
excellent
lacing
the
aromas
are
of
spicy
slightly
skunked
herbalmedicinal
hops
belgian
candy
sugar
yeast
and
some
nice
light
biscuitlike
malts
the
taste
is
suprisingly
hoppy
for
a
belgian
with
the
interesting
herbalmedicinal
hopping
running
the
show
the
middle
reveals
the
nice
biscuity
malt
flavors
and
in
the
finish
the
hops
reappear
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
fullbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
stronger
beer

mixed

initially
on

moving
towards
a
drier
fruitier
finish
at
the
end
a
bit
peppery
and
spritzy
the
whole
way
troughout
the
experience
very
good
stuff
overall
an
exceptionally
good
pale
ale
that
has
many
of
the
better
traits
from
the
other
artisanal
dupont
beers
most
notably
the
saison
highly
impressive
this
one
should
be
sought
out
pours
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
massive
head
this
bottle
was
a
gusher
for
some
reason
i
warmed
this
bottle
up
for
a
bit
and
when
i
popped
the
top
it
just
came
out
nonstop
for
nearly
a
minute
still
after
it
calmed
down
and
i
poured
it
the
head
was
unbelievable
the
aroma
consists
of
a
strong
sweet
yeasty
smell
with
fruit
spices
and
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
the
head
is
still
there
and
has
barely
dissipated
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
yeast
very
pronounced
spicing
that
is
rises
above
all
the
other
characteristics
somewhere
in
there
is
some
fruitiness
and
tapers
into
a
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
again
very
spicy
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
as
i
feel
the
spicing
is
a
bit
overthetop
but
i
cant
help
but
be
attracted
to
it
op

dept
like
the
saison
and
the
head
stays
throughout
the
journey
as
does
a
nice
clumpy
stick
very
hoppy
in
a
spicy
citrusy
way
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
snappy
and
somewhat
peppery
this
beer
is
highly
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
all
this
while
the
beer
exhibits
a
definate
sweet
malt
component
that
is
hidden
way
in
the
backgroud
just
as
the
abv
is
hidden
i
think
of
this
as
a
saison
at
mach
speed
better
balanced
than
some
other
saisons
i
have
tried
still
not
my
cup
of
beer
too
much
bite
and
not
enough
charcter
to
back
it
up
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffysticky
headaroma
was
spicey
and
citruisy
and
lightly
grassy
the
taste
is
lemony
with
some
pepper
notes
some
yeastiness
in
there
as
wellvery
refreshing
tasting
for
the
alcohol
content
this
is
very
easy
to
drinki
really
like
this
beer
i
have
to
say
i
paid
4

an
11
2
oz
bottle
in
omaha
blondeorange
color
with
a
meringuelike
head
that
imparts
huge
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
truly
a
sight
to
behold
nose
is
spicy
and
herbal
with
notes
of
earthy
hops
pear
and
green
apples
a
melon
aroma
even
appears
as
the
brew
warms
taste
is
a
magnificent
melding
of
herbal
earthiness
ripe

vaguely
tart
apple
honey
and
a
minor
hop
twang
on
the
finish
fullbodied
and
palatecoating
the
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
yet
subdued
truly
artisanal
as
the
8
5
abv
is
never
really
an
issue
drinks
incredibly
easily
certainly
one
of
duponts
top
offerings
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
banana
colored
and
it
had
a
slight
cloudhaze
to
it
and
when
held
to
the
light
carbonation
was
present
the
head
that
was
produced
was
white
in
color
and
had
good
retention
about
half
glass
then
fell
to
a
film
and
a
ring
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
had
the
consistency
of
thick
dense
foam
with
this
pillow
of
foam
sitting
on
the
top
it
produced
a
delicate
lace
that
stretched
down
the
glass
the
aromas
that
i
nosed
were
of
lots
of
spices
pepper
cilantro
clove
hops
fruit
and
malt
complex
nose
from
this
beer
the
flavors
that
i
tasted
were
of
rich
malt
fruit
green
apple
pear
lots
of
spices
and
herbs
floral
hops
some
yeasty
notes
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warmed
finished
alittle
dry
alittle
sweet
alittle
bitter
all
through
the
tasting
and
very
satisfying
medium
bodied
great
complexity
and
combination
of
flavors
and
smells
a
real
good
beer
and
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
will
search
out
again
a
great
saison
in
fact
take
anything
by
dupont
on
your
next
picnic
im
happy
i
did
nice
bold
golden
body
the
good
white
soupy
head
is
less
exuberant
than
many
similar
belgians
since
it
is
easily
controlled
and
it
fades
incompletely
but
it
has
exellent
lacing
good
fruitiness
mild
spiciness
good
crisp
maltiness
slightly
bitter
finish
lingers
an
indistinct
grapefruit
yellow
color
on
the
pour
the
head
modest
is
size
spumous
in
texture
the
color
a
bright
white
after
the
erosion
has
taken
place
a
thin
sheet
of
lace
covers
the
glass
malt
dominates
the
nose
somewhat
tart
also
quite
clean
and
fresh
with
the
start
sweet
but
the
tartness
hits
you
at
the
skeletal
top
finish
is
spiteful
in
its
bitterness
astringent
dry
aftertaste
drinkable
but
ive
had
much
better
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
magnificently
pillowy
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
almost
forever
and
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
thick
sheets
of
white
lace
an
absolutely
beautiful
beer
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
notes
of
clove
pepper
and
floral
hops
very
aromatic
medium
in
body
and
very
very
smooth
taste
is
sweet
and
spicy
at
first
with
flavors
of
fresh
fruit
mild
banana
juicy
orange
coriander
and
pepper
followed
by
a
raw
yeastiness
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of

this
is
an
excellent
belgian
ale
the
taste
is
fresh
and
enjoyable
i
have
had
this
one
several
times
and
i
enjoy
it
more
each
time
i
prefer
the
750ml
bottle
over
the
12oz
bottle
the
larger
bottle
allows
for
more
action
from
the
yeast
during
bottle
fermentation
and
the
large
space
allows
for
the
beer
to
mature
more
effectively
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
a
bite
the
nose
is
very
satisfactory
this
beer
poured
a
head
like
shaving
cream
thick
and
creamy
with
a
distinct
hoppiness
and
bitterness
to
the
foam
takes
quite
a
bit
to
settle
too
i
find
this
to
be
a
well
balanced
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
as
an
example
of
fine
belgian
brewing
good
stuff
overall
good
head
thin
and
white
even
if
a
little
compact
the
smell
is
floreal
that
explodes
in
the
nose
fresh
and
delicate
the
smell
is
somewhat
different
from
the
expectation
stronger
and
compact
white
a
note
of
bitter
notes
a
killer
saison
the
dreamy
flavours
nearly
numbs
the
senses
of
the
taste
buds
a
prize
brew
to
be
had
and
one
i
will
make
sure
to
have
around
golden
in
hue
with
a
slight
haze
topped
by
a
dense
porcelain
white
head
that
rises
peaks
then
slowly
settles
attractive
textured
lace
is
left
in
its
wake
pungently
sweet
citrus
fruity
esters
along
with
peppery
alcohol
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
malt
becomes
more
prominent
and
asserts
itself
aromawise
as
dryish
white
bread
like
graininess
mellow
clove
and
mild
mineral
notes
round
the
aroma
out
a
bittersweet
combination
of
candyish
sweetness
and
black
pepper
like
alcohol
is
perceived
at
first
in
flavor
then
is
ensued
by
a
melange
of
clove
phenol
vodka
soaked
semi
sweet
ripe
orange
fruit
and
bready
grain
similar
to
that
of
the
aroma
surprisingly
mild
in
esters
for
style
contrasting
bitterness
is
supplied
both
by
mild
hops
and
ethyl
alcohol
flavor
overall
sweetness
is
mild
and
is
mostly
derived
from
residual
sugars
not
caramel
malt
spicy
alcohol
couples
with
the
light
sweetness
to
lend
a
black
licorice
undertone
to
this
brew
deceivingly
light
in
body
w
a
quasi
crisp
quenching
mouthfeel
that
helps
lend
excellent
drinkability
considering
the
strength
finishes
dry
w
prickly
yet
pleasant
alcohol
tickling
the

moinette
blond
is
a
very

and
somewhat
raw
belgian
strong
that
manages
to
integrate
ethanol
flavors
with
sweet
fruitiness
its

around
delcious
and
certainly
another
unique
belgian
worthy
of
a
serious
tasting

maybe
a

the

but
bolder
in

carbonation

controlled
a
little

is
in

for
me
though
im
sure
this
brew
has
its
fans
as
much
as
i
like

dupont
i
may
like
the
blonde
moinette
even
more
with
its
higher
8

abv
as
opposed
to
the
saisons
6

i
view
it
as
a
sipping
version
of
the
saison
a
number
of
belgian
brewers
seem
to
make
a
stronger
version
of
their
normal
beer
rodenbach
and
de
koninck
come
to
mind
similar
to
the
saison
in
appearance
nose
palate
and
mouthfeel
moinette
boasts
just
a
little
bit
more
of
everything
a
smooth
and
powerful
blond

beer
mild
banana
and
clove
in
the
taste
dry

crisp
with
a
steady

and

huge

so
i
bought
18
of
these
one
left
to
age
my
favorite
band
from
my
favorite
brewery
ill
be
honest
though
it
taste
more
like
a
belgium
ale
there
is
a
creamy
note
to
this
beer
with
a
bit
of
spice
not
much
on
the
hoppy
note
ill
update
once
it
has
a
little
age
on
it
pours

be
the
currants
light

flavor
good
fruity
back
citrus
in
there
really
good
nicely
balanced
worked
for
me
think
this
beer
is
average
at
best
and
likely
the
reason
dfh
supposedly
retired
it
pours
gold
in
color
with
okay
head
and
suspended
particles
throughout
smells
of
currants
but
thats
about
it
pretty
tame
otherwise
tasted
pretty
bland
and
usual
not
quite
offcentered
enough
for
dfh
felt
easily
drinkable
but
was
completely
letdown
by
a
commentarive
beer
for
one
of
my
favorite
bands
needs
more
character
or
spunk
like
the
band
o
interesting
take
on
a
bspa
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
fruit
in
this
one
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavoring
the
nose
actually
started
out
a
bit
cheap
with
the
grain
taking
on
a
pseudoadjuncty
feel
this
thankfully
faded
with
warmth
giving
more
genuine
grain
fruit
and
sweetness
with
the
inclusions
of
the
black
currants
we
were
expecting
a
much
more
fruity
beer
but
instead
were
delivered
something
much
more
akin
to
a
sour
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
this
is
not
to
say
that
this
was
a
wildsour
but
the
tartness
of
the
fruit
took
us
off
guard
to
note
we
are
drinking
a
batch
1
november
2011
bottling
so
the
sweetness
has
had
time
to
settle
with
the
grain
coming
much
further
to
the
front
with
warmth
this
beer
gets
better
remaining
dynamic
and
something
unique
for
the
brewery
o
this
would
probably
have
been
much
better
fresh
however
i
dont
know
the
style
very
well
but
it
tastes
decent
i
bought
this
because
it
was
a
dfh
brew
that
i
hadnt
had
yet
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
today
was
a
bad
day
for
beer
but
this
was
probably
the
best
of
the
night
o
the
nose
is
very
fruitforward
and
sweet
but
thankfully
faithfull
ale
shows
more
balance
in
taste
the
belgian
aspects
of
it
are
very
downplayed
as
the
yeast
takes
a
passive
role
complexity
suffers
as
a
result
and
it
feels
a
little
dumbeddown
a
decent
beer
in
the
end
though
dogfish
head
perhaps
played
this
one
a
little
more
safely
than
they
should
have
sometimes
we
build
beers
up
to
be
bigger
than
they
should
be
perhaps
i
have
done
that
here
with
all
of
the
oceans
of
other
beers
out
there
this
one
did
not
make
me
smile

largely
because

of

its
easy
to
expect
a
heavy
and
complex
display
of
flavors
to
conjoin
the
fussion
of
peal
jam
and
dogfish
the
truth
is
that
the
demands
of
the
band
are
quite
banal
and
the
quality
of
dogfish
head
carries
the
collaboration
towards
success
i
didnt
expect
the
notion
of
pearl
jam
to
influence
the
beer
a
heavier
direction
but
the
beer
that
dogfish
head
creates
is
a
very
cream
ale
taste
but
with
a
fruityspicy
interplay
and
a
zesty
dry
finish
thats
much
commemorated
gread
job
to
dogfish
head
with
a
limited
scope
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
and
appeared
to
have
the
right
carbonation
for
the
style
which
is
to
say
very
carbonated
the
beer
did
end
with
a
dry
finish
overall
less
than
average
beer
that
i
had
high
expectations
for
i
am
glad
that
i
only
bought
the
one
bottle
as
i
could
not
even
finish
that
one
overall
very
interesting
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
overall
a
nice
belgian
with
honey
and
fruit
currants
i
assume
tastesweet
orchard
fruits
faint
black
currant
note
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
their
is
a
notable
lack
of
hops
in
the
flavor
profile
more
sweet
than
anything
a
good
dose
of
saaz
or
something
a
little
more
pronounced
would
have
worked
wonders
in
my
opinion
decent
at
best
o
solid
beer
nothing
over
the
top
impressive
about
it
but
one
that
drinks
fairly
easily
overall
this
is
a
really
mediocre
and
weird
beer
i
hate
not
being
specific
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
i
wouldnt
have
another
overall
this
beer
was
enjoyable
based
on
the
style
yes
it
is
milder
in
flavor
but
sometimes
this
is
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
overall
it
really
tastes
like
dogfish
adjunct
lager
it
exists
in
this
beer
some
nice
currant
notes
are
lost
amid
the
spice
and
adjunct
flavors
theres
potential
in
this
beer
but
it
got
lost
overall
great
brew
for
an
amazing
band
not
my
favorite
dfh
offering
but
definitely
interesting
and
well
done
currants
work
well
with
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
the
sweetness
is
controlled
well
and
never
becomes
overwhelming
i
would
look
to
try
this
again
d
certainly
drinkable
but
was
expecting
more
of
a
pronounced
curranttaste
and
a
bit
more
creativity
the
reasons
why
i
purchased
this
worth
a
try
if
the
price
is
right
meh
i
no
smell
hops
or
malt
but
i
did
smell
some
spiciness
pale
golden
color
with
moderate
head
and
a
bit
fluffy
belgo
i
guess
but
it
lacked
complexity
some
fruit
on
the
tongue
but
it
dies
pretty
quickly
its
better
than
that
triplehopped
foolishness
you
see
on
the
giant
billboards
around
town
but
dfh
has
done
better
a
lot
better
very
good
beer
not
something
id
seek
out
based
on
the
price
for
quality
ratio
but
still
i
love
pearl
jam
and
i
love
beer
so
no
regrets
750

from

westminster
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
lasting
white
head
aromas
of
straw
yeast
and
light
currants
mouthfeel
was
ligt
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
flavors
of
straw
yeast
and
light
currants
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
yet
another
boring
dogfish
experiment
i
like
the
unique
dogfish
head
connection
between
musicians
and
beers
the
bluesjazz
connections
have
made
sense
this
one
not
quite
so
much
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
ale
bright
malt
flavor
with
pleasant
lively
carbonation
i
really
didnt
detect
much
of
the
currant
influence
beyond
that
there
was
much
to
make
this
beer
particularly
memorable
pleasant
but
not
impressive
faithfull
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
goldenrod
with
about
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
crowning
the
beer
head
retention
isnt
bad
but
lacing
is
hard
to
come
by
the
nose
is
a
bit
dull
which
in
the
end
is
probably
doing
me
a
favor
but
what
aroma
is
perceptible
is
dominated
by
the
currants
theres
also
a
slight
peppery
phenolic
presence
but
all
it
really
does
is
hint
that
maybe
currants
dont
belong
in
this
style
of
beer
the
flavor
is
still
dominated
by
that
dark
raisiny
flavor
but
a
little
bit
of
pear
shows
up
and
joins
the
pepperclove
notes
to
provide
a
slight
belgian
strong
pale
framework
for
the
currants
they
dont
belong
here
any
more
than
they
did
in
the
nose
though
the
flavor
clashes
horribly
with
the
base
beer
the
body
is
nicely
dried
out
but
the
carbonation
isnt
as
expansive
and
lively
as
would
be
ideal
for
the
style
im
a
dogfish
head
fan
and
ill
try
just
about
anything
they
brew
at
least
once
because
more
often
than
not
i
can
dig
it
every
once
in
a
while
though
they
come
up
with
something
thats
just
a
complete
miss
for
me
and
this
is
one
of
those
times
very
good
worth
having
not
super
drinkable
or
particularly
worth
seeking
out
i
like
the
smell
of
this
ale
nothing
screams
out
belgian
strong
pale
to
me
though
the
fruitiness
from
the
currant
is
a
little
forward
in
the
nose
now
the
taste
is
where
im
stumped
on
where
to
place
this
beer
the
currants
hit
you
a
little
at
the
front
but
the
back
is
very
light
not
much
flavor
and
salty
yes
salty
now
thats
not
saying
i
wont
like
drinking
the
whole
bottle
because
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
7
percent
abv
beer
im
really
impressed
by
that
excellent
body
to
this
beer
too
very
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
so
i
guess
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
but
to
grade
it
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
now
thats
a
little
hard
to
do
smooth
and
wellbalanced
and
easydrinking
was
surprised
to
find
its
lower
rating
on
ba
above
average
there
was
a
ton
of
people
asking
for
this
limited
beer
weeks
before
it
arrived
is
it
a
good
beer
yes
absolutely
is
it
worth
all
the
phone
calls
trying
to
find
the
store
that
has
a
bottle
and
the
20
mile
drive
meh
probably
not
but
i
will
say
you
should
grab
one
if
you
get
the
chance

head

into
a
solid
18th

skim
some
spots
of

poor

nose
seems
a
bit
off
a
combination
of
grassy
skunky
and
citrusy
with
perhaps
a
trace
of
coriander
taste
is
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
nose
citrus
currants
pale
malts
and
a
suggestion
of
candi

theres
also
a
plesant

character
that
comes
out
towards
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
assertive
almost
prickly
carbonation
theres
also
a
slightly
oily
texture
which
is
quickly
dispersed
by
the
carbonation
a
slightly
acidity
around
the
edges
is
also
overshadowed
by
the
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
solid
bspa
not
mindblowing
by
any
means
but
a
good
domestic
example
of
the
style
at
7
abv
i
wouldnt
sit
on
this
bottle
too
long
right
now
it
is
pleasant
and
bright
however
i
would
be
concerned
that
some
of
the
off
aromas
might
eventually
translate
into
the
flavor
profile
c
while
this
brew
did
hide
the
abv
very
well
it
just
didnt
taste
very
good
and
its
hard
to
believe
that
im
disappointed
with
a
dogfish
head
beer
but
this
was
a
huge
letdown
the
sweetness
makes
it
drinkable
and
while
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
has
no
redeeming
qualities
to
make
it
anything
bust
just
an
average
beer
something
is
missing
as
the
flavor
just
remains
average
and
on
life
support
based
on
the
price
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
as
its
just
a
hair
above
a
macro
brew
lager
which
makes
this
honest
assessment
difficult
as
i
love
this
brewery
i
guess
this
shows
that
some
offcentered
experiments
do
actually
miss
the
flavor
mark
this
is
my
dfh
mulligan
my
advice
is
only
get
this
if
you
really
like
pearl
jam
or
are
trying
to
collect
everything
from
dogfish
head
horribly
overpriced
at
15
99
a
bottle
reminded
my
wife
of
budweiser
and
she
cant
stand
budweiser
like
a
light
belgian
gone
bad
no
taste
of
currents
or
aftertaste
whatsoever
really
disappointed
in
this
one
from
dfh
and
i
like
a
lot
of
their
stuff
pearl
jam
still
rocks
though
dogfish
head
does
quite
well
when
taking
fairly
common
and
contemporary
styles
and
jazzing
them
up
just
a
bit
i
think
they
did
fall
a
bit
short
in
this
rendition
however
simply
due
to
the
lack
of
noticeable
traits
from
a
primary
ingredient
listed
on
the
beers
jacket
the
wife
and
i
enjoyed
the
dry
finish
but
were
hoping
for
just
a
bit
more
complexity
from
added
fruit
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
fits
right
in
with
the
dfh
family
of
slightly
offcentered
from
style
beers
a
good
one
to
pair
up
with
cheeseandcrackerlevel
appetizers
or
white
grapes
it
just
doesnt
get
high
marks
relative
to
other
bspas
overall
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
i
liked
it
adn
would
drink
it
again
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
the
entire
bottle
but
nothing
that
i
would
especially
remember
o
this
was
an
interesting
try
by
dfh
i
know
they
were
trying
to
mix
styles
for
this
specialty
beer
while
it
was
a
decent
beer
its
not
one
id
go
running
back
to
immediately
m
d
pretty
standard
medium
body
carbonation
is
good
offering
a
nice
and
refreshing
drink
this
is
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
towards
the
end
of
summer
as
a
bit
of
a
chill
out
after
a
day
on
the
beach
kind
of
beer
not
lawnmower
but
refreshing
and
mellow
i
dont
know
if
id
return
for
another
but
i
might
give
it
some
consideration
perhaps
a
little
lackluster
but
alright
overall
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
better
than
it
was
the
currants
didnt
add
a
ton
and
it
all
turned
into
a
boring
belgian
golden
ale
i
would
pass
on
this
big
glowing
apricot
bright
orange
body
with
an
off
white
creamy
colored
head
with
a
fluffy
billowing
texture
the
body
was
slightly
clouded
and
the
head
formed
fine
even
lacing
as
it
dwindled
i
remember
au
courant
never
quite
taking
off
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
a
new
7
abv
currant
beer
the
nose
has
a
dry
powdered
yeast
note
that
falls
flat
a
bit
of
a
mineral
character
with
some
mild
earthiness
the
nose
isnt
very
expressive
with
the
currant
fruitinesstartness
i
was
expecting
flavor
is
actually
pretty
nice
with
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
tart
fruit
currants
mixing
together
with
a
wave
of
warmth
in
the
alcohol
and
a
dry
belgian
yeast
finish
not
much
in
the
way
of
spices
or
yeast
spiciness
there
is
a
textureflavor
that
i
just
dont
care
for
amongst
the
currant
jam
sweetness
that
almost
has
a
milky
powdered
crushed
calcium
tablet
note
about
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
something
in
texture
weighs
on
the
palate
between
each
sip
making
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
quaff
on
overall
this
beer
lacks
cohesive
flavors
that
would
be
expressive
of
such
a
great
and
timeless
band
like
pearl
jam
maybe
they
were
going
for
a
currant
jam
but
i
feel
this
beer
was
a
rehash
of
an
old
release
with
less
creativity
behind
than
their
other
album
releases
like
bitches
brew
or
hellhound
on
my
ale
overall
miss
o
ill
start
off
by
saying
that
i
listened
to
sam
calagiones
quick
blurb
about
this
beer
on
the
dfh
website
the
basic
intention
was
to
incorporate
pearl
jams
two
favorite
beverages
on
their
tours
fruitful
pinot
noirs
and
mexican
lagers
thats
a
pretty
tall
task
to
combine
but
i
think
dfh
accomplished
this
with
some
success
this
beer
no
doubt
has
lager
qualities
as
well
as
dry
fruity
wine
notes
from
the
addition
of
currants
the
flavor
certainly
isnt
the
best
ive
had
especially
from
dfh
but
this
does
have
a
nice
drinkability
quality
for
sure
a
big
challenge
was
taken
on
here
and
while
the
result
wasnt
a
big
hit
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
creativity
put
forth
to
celebrate
pearl
jams
20th
anniversary
pours
super
clear
super
golden
with
a
minimal
amount
of
pale
head
the
smell
is
very
currant
forward
with
not
a
lost
else
going
on
still
very
inviting
tastes
a
slight
of
booze
currants
and
sweetness
very
light
overall
has
a
bit
of
effervescence
and
sweetness
that
lasts
and
then
clears
off
the
palate
nicely
overall
a
bit
above
average
o
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
wasnt
true
to
style
nor
was
it
very
good
one
of
the
only
dfh
beers
i
will
put
in
my
do
not
buy
again
list
sad
really
especially
with
the
collaboration
with
pearl
jam
o
after
bitches
brew
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
release
but
it
was
definitely
a
let
down
the
addition
of
currents
was
an
odd
choice
imo
pearl
jam
deserves
better
o
i
liked
faithfull
ale
its
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
and
an
experiment
that
was
worth
a
taste
not
really
sure
why
its
pearl
jam
related
but
hey
it
works
if
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
dfh
ale
while
its
good
its
definitely
not
one
of
dogfish
heads
best
and
the
black
currants
are
likely
to
be
divisive
among
its
consumers
if
you
like
currants
give
this
one
a
try
o
this
was
a
disappointing
beer
but
could
have
been
more
disappointing
i
feel
the
currants
do
save
this
beer
just
wish
you
could
taste
them
more
i
am
a
big
fan
of
both
dogfish
head
and
pearl
jam
and
just
thought
that
they
would
make
a
better
beer
i
am
happy
that
i
got
a
bottle
but
will
not
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
nothing
and
leaves
little
or
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
candied
yeast
and
currants
the
aroma
is
there
but
it
is
fairly
weak
and
hard
to
get
a
good
feel
for
the
taste
mainly
follows
suit
it
starts
slightly
malty
and
then
gives
way
to
candied
yeast
and
the
back
end
gives
a
sweet
currant
taste
the
taste
was
a
little
weak
the
mouthfeel
was
lowly
to
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
average
for
the
style
i
would
have
liked
to
get
a
little
more
from
the
aroma
and
the
taste
on
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
their
best
d
i
guess
i
can
buy
the
integration
of
berries
into
this
one
but
im
not
too
enthusiastic
about
it
i
expected
to
hate
this
one
and
ended
up
being
able
to
finish
the
bottle
so
thats
a
definite
plus
o
decent
enough
beer
luckily
i
shared
this
with
my
brother
because
i
dont
think
i
could
do
this
all
alone
o
a
strange
beer
i
bought
it
cause
i
am
a
dogfish
head
and
perl
jam
fan
but
i
was
really
expecting
something
more
than
a
better
sa
blackberry
witbier
it
would
be
a
solid
basic
beer
from
any
other
brewery
but
from
dfh
it
is
dissapointing
faithfull
ale
is
alright
beer
but
isnt
great
i
had
hoped
for
a
little
better
frankly
it
just
seems
to
be
a
little
lacking
in
every
department
it
could
use
a
little
more
of
everything
the
flavor
really
needs
a
bit
more
pizzazz
a
bit
more
fruit
flavor
or
more
hops
might
do
the
trick
its
alright
though
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
crisp
and
dry
interesting
beer
very
very
yeasty
and
bready
with
more
currant
in
the
aroma
than
there
is
in
the
taste
more
accurately
the
currant
is
probably
more
forward
in
the
aroma
than
it
is
in
the
flavor
because
of
all
the
breadiness
in
the
taste
pours
golden
with
a
somewhat
thin
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
i
expected
a
darker
beer
probably
because
of
the
currants
so
that
was
a
surprise
quite
fruity
in
the
nose
with
noticeable
currant
notes
aside
from
the
breadiness
in
the
taste
the
currants
make
a
midpalate
appearance
followed
by
a
late
hoppy
bitterness
interesting
but
the
slightly
raw
yeasty
flavors
contribute
to
a
thicker
mouthfeel
i
actually
dont
mind
the
flavor
itself
primarily
since
i
like
a
yeasty
note
and
i
like
currants
but
i
could
see
how
this
could
easily
hit
the
wrong
notes
for
a
lot
of
people
o
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
brew
but
interesting
nonetheless
just
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
this
is
more
or
less
a
typical
belgian
ale
its
simple
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
for
an
anniversary
ale
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
this
definitely
wasnt
worth
the
15
price
tag
not
one
i
will
seek
out
again
it
has
several
things
going
for
it
its
drinkable
its
welldone
and
it
certainly
isnt
what
i
expected
as
for
the
currants
hmm
regardless
you
cant
go
wrong
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
enjoyable
but
honestly
there
is
not
much
going
on
was
enjoyed
accompanied
by
pearl
jams
ten
in
the
background
o
a
good
beer
but
not
amazing
not
all
that
complex
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
dogfish
head
but
overall
i
would
recommend
it
my
wife
liked
it
a
lot
given
the
light
body
and
subtle
taste
o
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
that
masks
its
alcohol
rather
well
cheers
overall
again
why
is
this
labeled
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
an
unremarkable
beer
by
all
accounts
perhaps
pearl
jam
likes
pbr
and
wanted
dfh
to
make
a
clone
needless
to
say
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
so
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
and
honestly
if
you
close
your
eyes
and
drink
it
expecting
a
macro
lager
it
is
quite
enjoyable
i
realize
that
dfhs
willingness
to
take
risks
often
results
in
beers
about
which
people
will
have
varying
opinions
but
still
not
quite
sure
what
dfh
was
thinking
with
this
one
marketing
seems
to
have
trumped
quality
control
d
easy
drinking
good
summertime
beer
and
goes
great
with
any
pearl
jam
album
you
have
not
heavy
and
enjoyable
o
good
beer
and
some
amazing
notes
a
little
to
warm
for
a
7
and
not
enough
hop
flavors
to
be
a
great
bpa

d
its
not
the
most
impressive
brew
but
i
do
think
its
quite
tasty
at
12bottle
i
likely
wont
ever
buy
it
again
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
was
easy
to
drink
the
whole
750
o
a
cool
idea
but
this
one
comes
across
a
bit
styleoversubstance
corona
plus
pinot
may
have
sounded
like
a
cool
tribute
idea
on
paper
but
this
didnt
work
out
so
well
as
a
finished
beer
this
is
very
weird
and
it
doesnt
entirely
work
somehow
despite
the
belgian
influences
and
the
currants
this
kind
of
tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
plenty
of
corn
insert
pearl
jam
joke
here
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
overall
not
bad
shame
on
you
dogfish
its
gonna
take
a
while
for
me
to
begin
forgiving
you
all
for
this
monstrosity
overall
turned
out
to
be
better
than
i
anticipated
i
got
a
nice
fruit
aroma
and
taste
which
was
great
definitely
will
drink
another
one
cheers
o
glad
i
tried
tried
one
and
was
able
to
share
with
a
pack
of
friends
whove
i
have
also
shared
time
with
at
several
pj
shows
well
this
is
slightly
underwhelming
but
no
real
complaints
ive
got
a
second
bottle
well
see
if
it
does
anything
with
age
nothing
special
but
ive
had
much
worse
i
wish
the
currant
was
featured
more
prominently
but
still
solid
o
a
good
beer
a
nice
beer
with
enough
unique
qualities
to
make
me
satisfied
with
the
effort
im
not
sure
the
style
was
the
right
choice
here
im
not
even
sure
this
beer
fits
this
particular
style
but
im
not
one
to
question
what
dfh
does
with
their
brews
they
are
good
at
what
they
do
and
i
appreciate
each
one
for
its
special
offcenteredness
and
this
one
is
no
different
dont
it
make
me
smile
yes
it
does
but
thats
all
it
makes
me
do
its
nice
its
even
nicer
if
you
like
midas
touch
i
do
and
especially
nice
if
you
wanted
this
bottle
for
your
personal
pearl
jam
collection
i
did
but
really
pearl
jam
deserves
a
way
better
more
exciting
more
complex
beer
but
hey
its
the
thought
that
counts
crisp
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
and
has
an
undertone
of
yes
currants
it
pours
a
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
yeasty
and
currant
notes
just
a
little
fruity
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
smooth
syrupy
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
a
firm
persistent
tingle
keep
on
pearl
jammin
overall
not
my
favorite
strong
pale
ale
and
my
least
favorite
yet
from
dfh
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
12bomber
i
definitely
expected
more
blah
i
drank
this
one
while
listening
to
the
album
that
inspired
it
i
can
see
why
the
album
inspired
it
as
i
find
it
easy
to
compare
the
2
there
was
flavor
there
but
it
wasnt
overwhelming
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
and
perhaps
slightly
overrated
it
poured
gold
smelled
wheat
like
and
had
a
hint
of
some
fruit
in
it
taste
was
wheaty
with
a
thin
finish
of
the
fruit
for
a
belgian
strong
ale
it
wasnt
very
strong
it
was
kind
of
thin
and
just
not
as
exciting
as
some
of
dogfishes
which
in
some
ways
was
a
good
thing
overall
it
was
drinkable
not
offensive
and
pleasant
to
sip
omain
2
reactions
i
spent
way
too
much
on
this
15
and
i
do
not
want
this
whole
bottle
to
myself
i
dont
know
what
dfhs
aim
was
here
but
they
missed
it
this
isnt
good
i
bought
a
a
12
pack
of
celebration
for
less
than
this
one
bottle
and
it
has
caused
me
to
rethink
how
i
buy
beer

notes
not
only
pretty
standard
and
unimaginative
but
a
tad
bland
almost
like
the
bottle
design
which
is
a
actually
worse
good
drinkability
though
for
a
mainstream
audience
maybe
they
were
going
for
that
maybe
that
is
its
better
quality
but
socially
unless
there
is
a
pearl
jam
fetish
involved
id
rather
offer
something
else
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
most
unremarkable
dfh
offering
ive
tried
in
a
long
while
easily
the
weakest
dfh
brew
ive
ever
had
tastes
like
an
average
lager
with
a
splash
of
white
wine
thrown
in
for
good
measure
belgian
strong
ale
pours
a
translucent
gold
color
with
a
nice
column
of
bubbles
arising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
they
fuel
the
growth
of
a
half
inch
of
frothy
pure
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
ring
and
legs
of
bubbles
across
the
surface
scattered
patches
of
white
bubbles
remain
as
lacing
it
smells
of
lager
yeast
various
grains
straw
wheat
faint
currants
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
more
earthy
with
an
emphasis
on
the
grains
straw
hay
wheat
and
a
more
pronounced
currant
flavor
especially
on
the
finish
some
lemon
yeast
grass
clove
and
alcohol
are
also
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
clean
and
finishes
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
well
done
overall
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
more
of
this
a
good
beer
but
def
not
that
great
as
far
as
style
goes
idk
why
dogfish
would
do
a
belgian
ale
for
pearl
jam
they
gould
have
done
something
intense
and
grungy
like
a
stout
porter
or
ipa
a
good
beer
but
not
that
interesting
overall
what
a
huge
disappointment
i
know
the
reasons
behind
making
this
beer
and
all
and
i
like
the
idea
but
come
on
why
even
bother
making
a
shit
beer
just
because
that
is
what
pearl
jam
drinks
at
the
end
of
the
day
buy
faithfull
for
the
bottle
if
youre
a
pearl
jam
fan
if
youre
a
beer
fan
stay
away
i
was
extremely
excited
to
try
faithfull
but
ended
up
pouring
out
about
34
of
the
bomber
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
the
smell
turns
me
off
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
and
its
easy
to
drink
still
a
let
down
coming
from
dfh
o
beer
is
ok
the
band
is
awesome
the
aroma
was
very
nice
lots
of
yeast
and
coriander
here
almost
a
peppery
like
note
bouncing
around
in
there
as
well
hints
of
grass
and
honey
as
well
as
some
light
touches
of
wheat
and
lemon
the
flavor
was
very
peppery
with
a
pronounced
zing
on
the
tongue
from
the
first
sips
nice
and
lively
feel
which
was
good
as
i
was
afraid
it
was
going
to
come
off
dull
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
coriander
riddled
throughout
this
one
which
on
its
own
this
would
be
an
excellent
belgian
ale
but
with
this
added
level
of
spice
it
just
got
that
much
better
very
dry
finish
with
the
moisture
zapped
from
the
tongue
and
a
nice
bitter
taste
left
behind
to
balance
and
play
around
o
drinkable
but
overly
sweet
and
lacking
the
complexity
i
was
expecting
i
guess
they
all
cant
be
winners
owas
expecting
more
from
dfh
it
seemed
to
taste
like
a
white
wine
to
me
what
bothered
me
was
the
mouthfeel
it
had
a
almost
stale
character
something
i
am
not
used
from
this
brewery
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
one
and
will
not
touch
it
again
especially
for
that
proud
price
therefore
my
rating
is
low
i
still
love
dogfish
o
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
expecting
to
get
curranted
to
death
but
instead
dfh
used
a
light
hand
with
the
fruit
and
created
an
aboveaverage
sweetish
bpa
of
medium
strength
not
a
gotta
have
type
of
beer
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
the
fruit
realy
does
enhance
the
aroma
and
flavor
while
nothing
extraordinary
i
really
dont
understand
some
of
the
low
scores
for
this
beer
its
a
tasty
enough
beer
and
one
i
would
definitely
consider
ordering
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
an
easy
drinking
and
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
was
overly
outstanding
or
interesting
the
currents
didnt
come
through
enough
to
really
add
anything
truly
interesting
for
me
either
first
time
ive
had
this
and
it
does
have
that
flavor
that
appears
in
a
lot
of
their
more
pushtheenvelope
beers
like
pangaea
but
the
currants
work
with
it
i
strongly
suggest
drinking
this
with
a
meal
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
pours
sort
of
a
gold
yellow
small
head
smells
fruity
apples
banana
pears
sort
of
fruity
up
front
finishing
pretty
smooth
a
little
carbonation
not
much
hops
very
smooth
thick
feel
to
it
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
nothing
to
rave
about
and
not
worth
15
bucks
but
if
it
were
cheaper
it
would
be
better
d
just
seems
like
something
is
missing
with
this
brew
or
maybe
it
was
a
little
rushed
either
way
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
music
collaboration
release
from
a
brewery
that
is
known
for
making
consistently
tasty
big
bodied
beers
this
is
disappointing
grab
something
else
for
the
price
o
pretty
forgettable
and
very
little
of
a
belgian
character
to
it
the

0
abv
is
well
hidden
and
i
would
not
have
guessed
that
it
was
this
high
but
i
dont
see
me
going
back
for
seconds
unlike
pearl
jams
ten
i
wasnt
hooked
on
the
first
trylisten
maybe
if
i
age
it
twenty
years
ill
reconsider
o
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
decent
beer
at
best
with
and
certainly
not
anything
that
will
blow
you
away
it
is
quite
drinkable
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
not
bad
but
i
think
i
was
just
expecting
a
little
more
sometimes
i
feel
that
way
with
pearl
jams
music
these
days
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
special
and
id
rather
see
something
that
stands
out
a
bit
more
for
one
of
my
favorite
bands
growing
up
but
its
far
from
bad
there
was
more
of
a
demand
for
this
beer
at
my
local
store
than
for
cbs
damn
i
gotta
see
what
this
stuff
brings
it
pours
a
clear
gold
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
corn
syrup
more
of
a
vague
sweetness
than
anything
but
this
is
a
close
enough
approximation
vague
berries
and
light
dank
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
those
berries
coming
in
even
lighter
and
with
a
bit
of
a
plastic
twinge
honestly
not
much
going
on
on
my
tongue
at
all
but
what
is
there
aint
all
that
appealing
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
and
boring
beer
given
the
greatness
of
ten

can
understand
why
some
people
dont
like
this
beer
that
much
or
its
nothing
special
but
for
the
style
of
it
being
a
golden
ale
its
amazing
i
think
the
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
people
dont
like
golden
ales
with
that
being
said
i
recommend
this

a
bit
of
a
disappointment
an
interesting
yet
rather
dulling
beer
by
that
i
mean
that
the
mild
astringency
bitterness
and
overbearing
dryness
makes
this
rather
flat
and
onedimensional
drinkable
sure
big
booze
buzz
check
memorable
and
wanting
you
to
drink
more
not
quite
fair
enough
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
to
get
really
excited
about
overall
this
is
a
big
bold
and
balanced
brew
that
gets
the
job
done
i
actually
preferred
it
a
little
on
the
cooler
side
as
some
of
the
flavors
start
to
tip
the
balance
as
it
warms
although
that
really
is
nitpicking
id
be
hardpressed
to
declare
any
significant
faults
enjoy
nice
tight
bubbled
foamy
2
fingers
of
head
that
leave
a
persistent
lacing
through
the
drink
aroma
is
very
hefeweizenlike
imo
banana
and
clove
come
through
in
the
yeast
peppery
tones
and
belgian
phenolics
are
also
present
taste
is
a
bit
flat
not
a
lot
of
nuance
but
im
not
mad
at
it
either
its
crisp
and
somehow
refreshing
for
a
10
brew
quite
dry
as
far
as
mouthfeel
very
tripellike
overall
a
decent
example
and
im
glad
this
is
readily
available
here
in
spain
the
taste
is
smooth
satisfying
and
beyond
reproach
o
some
aspect
of
this
beer
you
will
find
very
hard
to
beat
its
been
a
while
since
ive
tried
this
but
its
a
great
beer
and
recommended
there
is
not
much
more
that
you
could
want
from
a
beer
in
this
style
murky
orange
with
a
big
white
head
notes
of
pears
chardonnay
clove
and
bananas
very
classic
european
hop
gives
a
nice
earthy
and
grassy
counterbalance
in
the
finish
nice
carbonation
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
certainly
a
decent
bspa
i
might
try
this
again
in
the
future
a
very
good
belgian
ale
but
not
fantastic
worth
trying
but
id
ultimately
rather
have
a
piraat
or
dt
if
only
there
were
more
like
this
one
a
really
smooth
drinking
beer
especially
considering
its
high
alc
content
bottom
line
good
brew
with
too
much
carbonation
rjt
kind
of
an
earthy
subdued
version
of
the
style
drinkable
but
not
something
id
clamor
for
o
with
its
modest
3
97
ba
rating
currently
i
see
this
as
very
underrated
and
i
doubt
my
bottle
was
100
fresh
either
seeing
as
i
bought
it
on
the
grey
market
here
in
korea
overall
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
with
an
abv
of
10
i
should
be
just
sipping
it
but
the
taste
was
so
good
that
made
that
very
difficult
i
am
reviewing
a
beer
thats
been
stored
safely
since
2008
and
its
january
of
2014
if
ever
there
was
a
champagne
of
beers
this
is
it
fruity
zesty
a
bit
of
banana
grape
skins
and
honey
reminds
me
of
a
mead
i
made
back
in
1999
and
continue
to
cellar
to
this
day
very
heavily
carbonated
yet
with
a
round
mouth
feel
two
fingers
and
terrific
lacing
flavors
linger
and
slowly
fade
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
there
are
some
solids
in
the
deep
golden
brew
but
its
mind
over
matter
as
this
beer
warms
the
belly
with
the
obviously
present
yet
somehow
balanced
alcohol
what
a
treat
bottle
from
belgianbeershop
com
malheur
10
is
clear
golden
with
a
thick
and
stable
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
fruity
aspects
citrus
and
with
a
clear
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
very
like
the
aroma
this
beer
has
a
fresh
character
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
very
present
and
dominates
a
bit
too
much
overall
a
good
beer
that
goes
very
well
with
meat
dishes
d
a
good
but
not
fantastic
example
of
the
style
that
still
better
than
most
hint
it
does
get
much
better
once
it
warms
up
and
not
only
because
of
the
abv
kicking
in
sorry
just
lacks
balance
for
me
too
much
of
a
yoyo
experience
smell
is
a
bit
faint
theres
a
bit
of
spice
but
mainly
malt
equal
in
the
taste
with
that
theres
a
big
amount
of
boozyness
hardly
a
good
sign
alcohol
should
be
covered
by
aroma
and
flavour
and
here
its
not
happening
the
alcohol
is
sweet
and
warming
not
harsh
that
makes
up
for
something
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
boring

great

for
sipping
while
reading
a
great
book
or
just
sipping
what
am
i
thinking
overall
another
great
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
this
one
is
a
little
heavier
in
the
abv
at
10
so
that
should
be
respected
ws
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
smells
like
a
wit
tastes
like
an
american
wheat
beer
combined
with
a
maibock
very
unique
to
say
the
least
a
nice
presentation
though
a
bit
fetching
as
for
the
stalwarts
of
the
style
nonetheless
a
recommended
brew
that
improves
with
warming
and
exposure
and
at
10
percent
this
brew
offers
a
solid
stealth
mode
a
good
beer
if
not
that
interesting
a
high
alcohol
thirstquencher
good
beer
though
more
subtle
than
i
had
been
expecting
overall
a
nice
belgian
there
are
a
lot
of
layers
to
this
one
perhaps
if
this
one
wasnt
so
sticky
on
the
mouth
i
might
give
it
better
scores
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
a
sipper
i
dont
imagine
wanting
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
o
amazing
basically
tastes
like
an
unfiltered
wheat
with
a
strong
caveat
the
10
abv
beautiful
beer
t
astringent
lots
of
alcohol
some
sweet
and
acid
notes
long
final
a
very
good
golden
style
ale
with
plenty
of
character
d
drinkability
is
decent
the
smoothness
helps
to
mask
the
ten
percent
abv
well
medium
bodied
actually
a
bit
tingly
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
evident
in
the
towering
head
from
a
pour
helps
in
drinkability
very
decent
beer
boozy
and
chemical
element
might
be
a
turn
off
to
some
fits
the
style
overall
a
very
impressive
example
of
the
style
though
just
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palate
taste
is
sweet
matching
up
with
the
honey
flavor
it
has
hint
of
of
a
wheat
beer
taste
towards
the
end
of
the
swallow
say
no
to
morons
o
this
is
good
but
certainly
not
anything
special
d
as
it
warms
the
booze
starts
to
come
out
a
bit
more
but
this
is
still
a
fine
enough
beer
d
an
above
average
bspa
not
as
complex
as
many
in
style
but
still
well
made
a
cost
efficient
beer
for
style
d
this
beer
is
definitely
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
dryness
and
high
alcohol
content
lovely
beer
a
really
smooth
and
mellow
but
spicy
and
complex
belgian
strong
pale
such
beers
are
rare
indeed
and
more
often
than
not
you
have
to
take
the
intense
heat
and
spice
as
part
of
the
package
im
glad
this
one
mellows
it
so
much
jd
overall
this
beer
is
good
the
aroma
is
wonderful
but
the
alcoholic
flavors
are
quite
strong
i
think
this
beer
would
get
much
better
with
some
age
this
is
a
really
tasty
brew
goes
down
very
easy
complex
rich
well
crafted
i
would
buy
it
again
and
recommend
you
try
it
drinkability
a
strong
not
overly
boozy
belgian
pale
i
happen
to
like
dry
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
pretty
tasty
glad
i
got
to
try
it
bottle
split
and
paired
with
moules
bleu
at
granville
d
exceptionally
drinkable
i
still
cant
believe
the
gravity
indicated
on
the
label
and
apart
from
abv
the
balance
and
craftmanship
are
just
right
on
well
constructed
carbonation
is
stupidly
high
pretty
warm
even
for
a
belgian
strong
but
nice
enough
for
a
nightcap
overall
ill
probably
try
it
again
just
to
check
d
apart
from
the
nose
this
beer
makes
for
quite
the
belgian
strong
quite
a
bit
fruitier
than
duvel
and
almost
veers
into
belgian
ipa
territory
imo
but
does
not
detract
from
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
in
the
least
drinkability
i
find
this
one
really
growing
on
me
its
extremely
drinkable
considering
the
abv
i
could
really
find
myself
getting
in
trouble
with
this
one
thats
a
sure
sign
of
greatness

this

a

beer
its
drinkable
for
what
it
is

its
definitely
one
and
done
overall
it
is
decent

not
an

version
of

big
kick
of

flavors
in

beer
that
didnt
appeal
to
me
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
to
it
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
give
it
a
try
a
good
beer
which
was
complex
and
flavorful
although
im
not
sure
i
could
have
one
per
session
drinkability
was
average
as
it
was
good
but
to
me
would
only
be
good
in
limited
quantities
d
wow
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
great
with
food
too
this
beer
is
thick
but
effervescent
its
not
afraid
to
make
its
alcohol
known
though
this
only
adds
to
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
the
smells
hinted
at
in
the
nose
bloom
into
something
else
when
the
alcohol
comes
in
its
very
deep
and
warming
adding
a
layer
of
caramel
malt
that
was
not
originally
detected
in
the
nose
very
honeylike
it
tastes
delicious
it
reminds
me
incredibly
of
champagne
as
well
as
mead
though
it
seems
less
onedimensional
than
most
champagnesmeads
ive
had
this
has
spice
and
kick
and
a
great
sweet
warmth
that
the
carbonation
takes
right
off
your
tongue
so
it
does
not
become
too
cloying
even
at
5
for
330
ml
i
could
easily
see
myself
buying
this
again
d
i
really
didnt
like
this
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
although
its
better
than
what
i
remembered
it
still
becomes
to
cloying
with
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
taste
theres
much
better
bspas
out
there
f
a
little
more
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
dryness
but
a
lingering
bittersweet
taste
way
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
more
lemon
peel
and
lingering
bitter
hops
with
some
citrus
lemongrass
and
floral
tastes
i
also
get
a
touch
of
honey
which
seems
to
come
out
a
bit
on
the
finish
and
could
account
for
some
of
that
dryness
for
10
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
too
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
that
drinks
a
lot
smaller
than
it
is
very
easydrinking
and
well
worth
a
shot
i
like
this
its
a
good
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
blonde
still
like

easy
drinker
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
moreish
however
i
could
see
this
one
getting
too
cloying
after
a
couple
floral
nose
citrus
record
but
also
with
more
subtle
flavors
of
apples
it
is
at
first
sweet
palate
a
little
spicy
but
it
quickly
becomes
bitter
for
us
to
offer
a
persistent
finish
transmitting
the
palace
of
the
bitterness
and
dryness
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
like
an
apple
liqueur
and
accompanied
by
delicate
flavors
of
rose
it
stands
out
as
a
beer
very
well
balanced
where
high
rates
of
alcohol
does
not
supplant
its
flavor
nor
its
delicious
flavor
drinkability
big
beer
with
hidden
alcohol
content
id
serve
this
with
scallops
or
shrimp
scampi
too
strong
for
me
and
i
had
a
terrible
headache
the
following
morning
this
wasnt
the
only
beer
that
night
but
i
am
sure
it
did
the
damage
pretty
interesting
just
seems
a
bit
blah
to
be
given
a
better
review
dnot
very
drinkable
due
to
the
abv
but
after
the
beer
really
warms
it
goes
down
real
smooth
overall
im
afraid
not
bad
not
good
almost
like
a
mead
tastes
like
honey
and
booze
mostly
but
for
10
you
get
your
worth
however
for
a
belgian
pale
i
think
of
lost
abbey
inferno
and
thats
way
more
delicous
than
this
bottle
poured
into
maredsous
goblet
has
nice
golden
hues
and
a
bigtime
head
that
explodes
out
the
goblet
like
a
pillowy
mushroom
smells
fruity
and
boozy
with
peach
and
lighter
fruit
esters
and
yeast
on
the
nose
tastes
very
nice
good
malt
presence
tarty
fruit
flavors
with
alcohol
underneath
a
nice
sourbitterness
on
the
finish
has
a
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
bitey
carbonation
drinkability
its
pretty
strong
but
its
fine
for
the
style
a
good
brew
but
the
nose
is
weak
a
brew
more
for
the
eyes
and
teeth
than
the
nose
and
tongue
d
great
sipper
one
must
sip
it
to
appreciate
all
the
complexities
and
not
let
the
aftertaste
of
phenols
overwhelm
you
overall
a
great
crowdpleaser
no
strong
or
offensive
flavors
and
appealing
even
to
the
nonbeerdrinker
dabove
average
good
brew
smooth
complex
enjoyable
drinkability
is
good
but
i
find
the
alcohol
somewhat
distracting
at
the
finish
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
a
standby
classic
that
wont
do
ya
wrong
craving
a
belgian
golden
or
a
tripel
hit
this
one
up
the
price
tag
on
the
750
isnt
exactly
one
you
could
trip
over
but
that
aside
a
fine
solid
belgian
golden
brew
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
belgianstyle
beers
that
ive
had
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
select
first
its
a
decent
beer
but
expensive
for
it
is
overall
a
wonderful
brew
the
alcohol
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
finish
a
750
by
yourself
but
it
is
worth
the
effort
pours
a
golden
yellow
colored
body
some
cloudiness
huge
white
frothy
head
diminishing
with
good
lacing
light
floral
sweet
aroma
fruity
like
pears
and
apple
juice
some
maltiness
too
dry
sweet
taste
not
overly
strong
but
some
good
flavor
some
light
maltiness
sweet
fruity
and
floral
taste
some
sharp
bite
maybe
the
alcohol
hides
the
10
very
well
though
strong
carbonation
some
spiciness
and
a
little
alcohol
as
it
warms
more
in
the
aftertaste
had
this
after
work
tonight
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
faded
slowly
and
left
good
lacing
smelled
fruity
and
yeasty
and
slightly
sour
tasted
sweet
tangy
fruity
and
yeasty
smooth
and
carbed
well
with
nice
alcohol
warmth
drinks
easily
but
no
more
than
a
couple
this
was
a
surprise
and
a
half
my
girlfriend
and
i
went
to
the
liquor
store
looking
for
something
new
and
this
was
the
only
belgian
golden
one
of
her
favorite
styles
that
we
had
yet
to
try
out
of
the
selection
i
was
skeptical
but
intrigued
so
we
gave
it
a
shot
both
of
us
have
found
an
instant
new
favorite
and
most
importantly
one
that
we
can
both
enjoy
together
since
she
rarely
likes
the
same
ones
i
do
d
the
high
abv
limits
the
drinkability
of
this
one
but
it
is
a
nice
sipper
overall
malheur
10
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
recommended
malheur
means
misfortune
i
appreciate
the
belgian
penchant
for
sly
humor
in
the
naming
of
beer
but
i
feel
extremely
fortunate
in
having
found
this
750
ml
bottle
of
malheur
10
oh
i
get
it
its
irony
this
offering
is
almost
as
good
as
brouwerij
de
landtsheers
biere
de
champagne
biere
brut
brut
reserve
bottom
line
this
is
an
easy
recommendation
for
all
those
who
love
big
bold
bspas
and
tripels
i
like
the
beer
it
not
one
to
have
too
many
of
in
one
night
but
a
good
strong
beer
to
end
the
evening
pour
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
from
a
750ml
bottle
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
with
healthy
looking
head
head
is
a
creamy
white
but
thins
quickly
but
does
hang
on
side
of
glass
as
consumed
color
is
an
amber
yellow
aroma
yields
notes
of
some
honey
but
definite
notice
of
alcohol
notes
warmth
of
alcohol
comes
at
initial
sip
and
as
a
long
finish
tastes
of
some
honey
and
citrus
i
consider
this
drink
fairly
drinkable
even
with
a
10abv
but
like
most
within
its
style
it
can
come
and
bite
you
in
the
end
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
it
was
definitely
fruit
overtones
but
i
could
not
pin
down
seems
to
be
a
variety
of
things
going
on
here
while
fruity
it
is
not
overly
sweet
which
for
me
is
a
plus
drinkable
yes
but
i
could
not
have
more
than
2
at
time
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
fine
bspa
indeed
sweetness
dissapates
nicely
as
the
brew
warms
leaving
the
final
few
sips
even
more
enjoyable
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
lots
of
floating
sediment
small
little
head
to
it
minimal
lacing
smell
is
boozy
very
boozy
actually
as
in
it
makes
me
almost
cringe
smelling
it
and
ive
had
dfh
120
which
is
half
the
alcohol
smell
of
this
taste
is
lots
of
alcohol
taste
it
overpowers
about
everything
else
in
the
beer
taste
is
apple
juice
like
typical
of
any
belgian
bleh
not
very
good
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
belgian
id
just
go
for
a
unibroue
for
half
the
price
and
twice
the
taste
d
very
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
nice
light
belgian
beer
good
for
a
spring
or
summer
picnic
this
beer
will
do
better
paired
with
food
than
alone
if
you
are
looking
for
a
complex
belgian
look
elsewhere
definitely
a
good
beer
slightly
overhyped
in
my
opinion
but
worth
the
try
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
added
this
to
my
single
bottle
sixer
at
the
local
liquor
store
not
expecting
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
d
this
is
a
beer
thats
solidly
made
with
some
good
attributes
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
decent
brew
bottle
labeled
best
by
31009
not
sure
how
old
that
means
it
is
golden
colored
orange
and
yellow
playing
throughout
big
but
not
too
thick
head
that
lasts
a
while
smells
sweet
like
peaches
and
mandarin
oranges
with
a
yeasty
zest
same
in
the
flavor
with
some
buttery
not
diacetyl
notes
sweetness
is
very
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
though
no
hops
detectable
in
the
flavor
i
get
some
honey
notes
as
well
which
usually
comes
when
the
paler
strong
beligians
have
some
age
on
them
noticable
alcohol
flavor
at
the
end
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
burn
the
alcohol
is
the
only
thing
preventing
the
4
5
on
taste
finishes
kind
of
dry
medium
to
high
carbonation
a
sipping
beer
but
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
the
bspa
style
is
pretty
broad
as
far
as
i
know
and
this
one
leans
more
towards
the
tripel
end
than
say
the
duvel
end
either
way
its
a
great
beer
drinkability
for
a
10
pt
beer
this
is
curiously
quaffable
great
beer
better
belgian
ive
had
in
a
while
an
excellent
tripel
with
good
spice
and
fruit
notes
the
beer
pours
a
bright
slightly
hazy
yellow
golden
appearance
with
a
big
sticky
head
the
flavors
are
crisp
with
both
citrus
and
spice
there
is
a
greater
hop
presence
than
ive
had
before
in
a
tripel
it
doesnt
dominate
but
the
presence
of
lemony
hops
is
very
nice
the
feel
is
creamy
and
rich
and
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
warming
its
a
very
good
beer
that
drinks
easily
but
should
be
savored
for
its
complexity
overall
a
nice
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
more
mellow
lemon
and
a
tinge
more
alcohol
showed
up
as
i
finished
the
bottle
this
one
might
be
worth
splitting
with
a
friend
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
for
solo
consumption
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
an
outstanding
belgian
pale
ive
had
the
malheur
12
as
well
and
was
equally
as
impressive
its
a
shame
this
brewery
kind
of
goes
under
the
radar
at
least
around
where
im
from
this
was
one
of
the
more
unique
brews
especially
belgian
ive
had
recently
and
was
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
poured
a
golden
body
with
cloudiness
and
a
voluminous
soapy
head
that
was
about
three
fingers
and
took
forever
to
die
strong
citric
notes
in
the
smell
along
with
some
spices
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
very
mild
malt
smell
a
fullerbodied
pale
ale
that
not
only
contains
some
caramelhoney
and
other
sweet
sticky
malts
but
had
some
spice
to
it
along
with
both
a
citric
kick
and
heavier
fruits
like
orange
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
the
10
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
as
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
and
the
backbite
is
pleasant
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
pale
ale
my
preference
for
pale
belgians
is
slightly
lower
alcohol
and
more
sweetness
ie
tripels
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
outside
of
basic
pils
malt
and
drying
alcohol
like
i
say
if
you
like
duvel
youll
love
this
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
definitely
warms
as
it
goes
down
though
not
as
warming
as
a
good
ris
on
a
cold
winter
day
but
still
warming
oily
is
right
when
held
in
the
mouth
there
is
definitely
an
oily
character
to
this
one
finish
is
semidry
complimenting
the
earthy
woody
flavor
and
aroma
that
is
found
in
this
beer
body
is
mediumfull
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
again
and
ill
gladly
finsih
my
glass
but
its
not
one
id
like
to
pay
around
15
a
four
for
its
a
great
beer
dont
get
be
wrong
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
as
mindblowing
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
make
a
regular
or
fall
back
i
could
sip
this
all
night
and
i
pretty
much
did
i
drank
this
beer
over
the
course
of
almost
two
hours
and
loved
every
sip
not
as
complex
as
some
bspas
but
i
love
how
the
flavor
changes
throughout
the
course
of
drinking
this
do
to
temperature
changes
and
the
introduction
of
more
oxygen
very
good
drinkability
considering
the
abv
which
is
scary
i
could
down
two
in
the
course
of
a
night
then
sleep
like
a
baby
pours
a
nice
gold
color
lightly
hazy
with
a
white
towering
head
that
has
been
beaten
to
stiff
peaks
by
the
time
it
goes
from
the
bottle
to
the
glass
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
yeasty
flavor
is
champagne
and
alcohol
up
front
with
a
yeastiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
is
far
and
away
one
of
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
it
is
wonderfully
complex
if
a
fan
of
the
style
seek
out
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
incredibly
well
made
bspa
so
tasty
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
light
body
and
restrained
flavors
make
it
very
dangerous
drinkability
is
amazing
for
a
10
percent
abv
great
balance
awesome
taste
and
a
smooth
drink
all
the
way
swung
over
to
discount
liquor
while
my
wife
and
i
had
a
rehearsal
for
her
college
roommates
wedding
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
malheur
brut
from
a
friend
in
the
mj
rare
beer
club
so
i
was
super
excited
when
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
for
a
reasonable
price
this
bottle
conditioned
strong
golden
ale
pours
out
a
glowing
gold
with
a
very
slight
haze
heavy
yeast
sediment
was
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
initially
a
thick
quilt
of
airy
snowy
white
foam
lay
on
top
as
it
leaves
traces
of
its
remnants
on
the
side
of
the
glass
my
chimay
chalice
keeps
a
solid
layer
of
foam
the
entire
glass
a
slightly
peppery
and
yeasty
aroma
lifts
from
the
glass
the
nose
is
not
super
strong
on
this
one
but
it
almost
seems
appropriately
subdued
the
flavor
speaks
for
itself
on
this
one
the
sugary
sweet
and
dry
flavors
match
wonderful
against
the
yeast
presence
a
strong
finishing
hop
presence
reminds
you
of
the
bitterness
as
it
seems
to
blend
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
the
heavy
carbonation
and
bottle
conditioning
lends
a
creamy
and
delicate
mouthfeel
an
almost
floral
softness
is
balanced
with
a
slight
metallic
feel
this
is
textbook
strong
golden
ale
at
its
finest
the
popularity
of
duvel
and
delirium
seem
to
overshadow
all
the
wonderful
goldens
out
there
but
that
is
just
fine
with
me
a
gem
like
this
should
be
enjoyed
and
moderately
with
the
10
abv
and
shared
with
those
whom
appreciate
a
lovely
belgian
ale
in
its
finest
form
d
very
drinkable
and
lighter
than
one
might
expect
of
10
abv
palate
is
fluffy
and
warming
on
belgian
yeast
spice
finish
is
on
yeasty
bitterness
smoke
some
tangerine
and
rust
finish
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
taste
is
crisp
pear
apple
peach
and
grape
not
over
sweet
yeasty
carbonation
and
some
citrus
overall
a
nice
beer
one
ive
been
needing
for
a
while
i
think
its
a
good
example
for
the
style
with
a
saison
bit
of
a
twist
i
like
it
d
could
i
session
this
if
i
had
two
livers
possibly
a
wonderful
beer
worth
the
price
of
admission
im
feeling
like
im
on
the
top
of
the
world
and
im
barely
half
way
through
drinkability
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
is
distinctive
in
its
lack
of
distinction
theres
nothing
here
that
warrants
a
5
rating
but
it
is
a
solid
4
5
in
every
aspect

another
treasure
from
belgium
i
enjoyed
the
malheur
10
although
it
failed
to
ever
really
capture
me
its
by
no
means
the
most
impressive
example
of
this
wonderful
style
but
like
everything
in
the
malheur
series
its
still
something
well
worth
buying
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
strong
pale
ales
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
that
is
active
with
carbonation
and
produces
a
terrifically
tall
bright
white
rocky
head
that
sticks
well
the
tall
head
leaves
a
fine
sheet
of
belgian
lacing
in
the
tulip

the
nose
is
quite
lively
slightly
floral
sweet

and
contains
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
the
palate
is
deadon
with

throughout
a
pleasant

on
the

mouth
feel

quite

with
some
lingering
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
finishes
slightly
alcoholic
and
acidic
but
is
really
quite
wellbalanced
for
the
most
part
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
to
be
honest
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
id
go
for
again
clear

in
the

with
a
few

that

like

in

despite

easily
only
because
its

will
have
to
try

at

10
abv
brew
this
beer
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
especially
in
the
middle
of
august
i
just
love
the
way
belgian
strong
pale
ales
come
out
of
the
bottle
looking
all
foamy
begging
me
take
a
sip
before
i
can
finish
typing
up
notes
on
how

look
malheur
10
had
that
classic
pilsner
float
appearance
down
pat
the
aroma
was
mild
with
a
lemony
and
floral
scent
promising
a
subtle
puch
to
come
so
on
to
the
first
sip
i
went
the
taste
sweet
tart
earthy
and
a
little
more
bitter
than
anticipated
there
was
a
lot
of
interplay
between
the
dry
fully
attenuated
malt
the
dusty
yeast
and
aged
hops
the
peppery
hot
alcohol
was
a
lot
more
up
front
than
the
likes
of
sneaky
duvel
and
there
were
no
pretensions
on
this
being
a
beginners
drink
mouthfeel
was
medium
full
and
warming
this
was
a
classy
golden
ale
all
the
way
i
will
now
be
picking
up
more
of
their
offerings
as
one
330
ml
bottle
just
wont
do
i
picked
this
up
at
bermans
in
lexington
ma
of
all
places
the
liquor
store
is
definitely
upgrading
the
pour
is
prodigious
youll
get
a
nice
cloudy
orangy
yellow
with
a
very
thick
and
frothy
white
head
that
retains
and
retains
the
lacing
is
about
as
thick
and
long
lasting
as
any
youll
find
the
smell
is
candied
sugars
sweet
malts
tangy
fruits
and
cloves
the
taste
is
a
burst
of
orange
full
bodied
strong
sweet
malts
typical
belgian
candied
sugars
some
citrus
a
bit
of
a
yeast
punch
in
the
middle
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
an
aftertaste
that
is
warming
alcohol
and
more
lingering
yeast
the
downside
is
probably
the
aftertaste
that
lingering
sweet
alcoholy
yeastiness
is
what
typically
gives
me
heartburn
if
i
have
too
many
lchaim
the
feathery
floral
and
citrus
hints
are
pleasant
surprises
its
got
a
subtle
complexity
that
delivers
a
lilting
multidimensional
flavor
profile
the
abv
is
gaudy
and
bold
but
the
fuzzy
warmth
is
a
willing
accompaniment
basically
this
is
everything
youd
want
in
a
good
big
belgian
complete
with
some
impressive
highlights
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
delicate
slightly
creamy
with
a
medium
dry
finish
perfect
for
the
style
i
think
this
makes
a
relatively
good
food
beer
for
fish
or
even
cheese
and
peppery
crackers
great
interpretation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
pleasant

overly
sweet
could
be
better

i
feel
pretty
satistied
after
just
the
one
but
wouldnt
refuse
another
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
actually
like
this
version
better
than
the
michael
jackson
commemorative
edition
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
is
much
more
reasonably
priced
than
some
of
the
others
in
this
line
i
would
drink
it
again

drinkable
for
the

thankis
to
brickstore
dave
for
this
one
overall
impression
this
is
a
kick
in
the
head
alcohol
is
really
raw
but
held
up
by
enough
malt
and
other
flavors
as
to
make
it
bearable
this
falls
into
my
personal
belgian
malt
liquor
category
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
but
its
really
not
bad
poured
into
a
belgian
beer
snifter
the
malheur
appears
a
pretty
opaque
golden
hue
with
a
fullbodied
head
that
has
serious
stayingpower
and
leaves
some
lace
i
also
see
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
in
the
glass
and
a
strong
steady
stream
of
carbonation
rising
up
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
spicy
orangepeach
aroma
with
hints
of
citrusy
yeast
and
a
smooth
malty
scent
the
taste
aptly
follows
suit
presenting
heavy
spice
and
orange
and
peach
flavors
also
notable
is
a
strong
honey
presence
which
balances
the
fruitiness
quite
well
and
mellows
the
whole
thing
out
man
what
a
tasty
beer
this
is
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
slight
citrus
tang
on
the
whole
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
forget
the
high
alcohol
10
abv
and
just
dive
in
this
is
a
brew
to
be
enjoyed
yearround
and
should
be
just
as
easily
consumed

celebrate
a
special

it
would

that

a
pretty
good

but
not
a
standout
in
this
style
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
would
reach
for
others
first
i
poured
it
in
a
tulip
glass
and
man
oh
man
did
the
foam
come
forth
at
least
four
fingers
of
head
on
the
glass
and
when
it
settled
a
it
remained
a
respectable
one
inch
and
it
gave
off
a
variety
of
flavor
the
dominating
was
the
slight
horse
blanket
odor
that
many
belgians
have
but
the
picture
i
had
in
the
back
of
my
mind
as
i
drank
was
of
a
lemonlime
soda
it
had
the
tang
of
a
carbonated
drink
but
it
was
not
fruity
i
found
little
bitterness
but
a
distinct
hop
flavor
lingered
on
the
tongue
there
was
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
that
was
very
pleasant
its
been
awhile
since
i
have
had
a
belgian
strong
pale
so
i
decided
to
go
with
this
one
for
a
fixpoured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
medium
to
deep
golden
with
a
large
blooming
head
that
left
alot
of
brusselsstyle
lace
behind
like
in
sheets
somewhat
mild
in
the
nose
not
overly
phenolic
which
in
my
mind
is
goodsome
light
citrus
fruit
and
honey
notes
mainly
milder
but
quite
flavorful
the
phenols
are
again
in
check
pretty
well
with
just
a
light
clove
note
some
refreshing
tangerine
and
ripe
orange
flavors
with
a
green
herbal
finish
this
was
a
nice
beer
somewhat
refreshing
and
light
for
such
a
big
beer
it
looks
very
nice
in
a
chalice
and
unlike
the
last
few
belgian
belgianstyle
beers
that
ive
had
recently
the
head
calms
down
soon
after
the
pour
and
maintains
a
perfect
thickness
on
top
of
the
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
to
really
wow
me
in
nearly
a
year
since
the
chouffe
ipa
complex
interesting
and
very
very
yummy
drinkability
now
that
the
10
abv
has
numbed
the
lower
half
of
my
body
i
must
warn
you
that
this
beer
is
criminally
sneaky
drinking
a
750ml
alone
for
reviewing
purposes
is
wonderfully
exciting
but
i
would
emphatically
suggest
a
partner
for
the
undertaking
this
is
malheurs
masterpiece
overall
its
pretty
nice
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
much
of
the
nice
thing
about
it
is
that
the
sweetness
tastes
like
honey
not
implying
they
use
honey
in
the
beer
rather
than
just
gobs
of
candy
sugar
like
some
belgiansbelgian
interpretations
medium
bodied
tingling
mouthfeel
to
start
things
off
notes
of
banana
and
pear
with
a
touch
of
dough
dominate
the
flavors
to
begin
but
a
blast
of
bitterness
takes
over
as
the
sip
progresses
finishes
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
the
lingering
bitterness
an
intriguing
beer
that
while
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
sharing
as
the
whole
bottle
is
a
little
much
for
one
to
consume
on
their
own
as
far
as
the
strong
belgian
pales
go
this
is
a
good
example
but
better
examples
are
available
here
the
flavour
varied
nicely
between
sweet
candi
sugar
spicy
coriander
and
bitter
hops
the
alcohol
warmed
but
never
burned
going
down
making
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
for
10
per
cent
abv
if
anything
detracted
from
the
drinkability
it
was
the
overly
dry
powdery
finish

a
very

has
a
creamy
character
i
appreciated
this
combination
but
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
is
drinkable
25cl
is
already
too
much
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
head
cloudy
golden
color
the
glass
presentation
is
great
smells
good
but
i
cant
pick
out
any
individual
aromas
nice
flavor
you
cant
tell
that
you
are
drinking
such
a
strong
beer
there
is
some
taste
that
i
just
cant
describe
that
lingers
after
you
swallow
smooth
going
down
definitely
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
bottle
poured
a
golden

beer

taste
is
also
hoppy

alcohol

hidden
which
im
starting
to

is

good
carbonation

me
want
to

quirky

in
flavor
the

yields
to
a

and
clove
sweetness
reemerges
promptly
albeit
in

bitterness
is
soft
overall
but
there
remains
a
sharp
pithlike

overshadowed
underripe
honeydew
melon

tartness
moderate
in
body
with
a
lightly
syrupy
but
not
cloying

finishes
simply
sweet
with
an
abrupt
minerally
twang
ethanol
warmth
pokes
through
the
residual
sugar
after
a
several
second
deliberation
perhaps
not
an
ideal
brew
for
aging
but
its
nonetheless
a
fine
satiating
brew
it
lacked
the
dangerous
briskness
of
many
fine
tripels
id
love
to
try
this
near
the
source
this
was
from
one
of
the
750
ml
bottles
that
was
designated
mm
for
the
millenium
it
has
a
big
head
and
a
spicy
hoppy
aroma
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
and
it
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
the
taste
of
fresh
lemon
zest
a
spectacular
beer
but
i
feel
that
drinking
too
much
of
this
in
a
sitting
would
not
be
a
good
thing
because
it
goes
down
so
easily
and
packs
quite

the
initial
glass
is
fairly
clear
but
it
becomes
quite
hazy
with
subsequent
pours
as
the
rising
carbonation
stirs
up
the
yeast
sediment
a
tall
head
of
brightwhite
foam
rises
up
over
the
goldenorange
body
as
if
it
wants
to
escape
from
the
glass
the
retention
is
excellent
and
it
maintains
a
short
creamy
cap
and
leaves
some
fairly
solid
sheets
of
lace
throughout
the
entire
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
light
note
of
vanilla
a
lowkey
fruitness
some
peppery
spiciness
alcohol
and
a
surprisingly
bright
hoppiness
its
initially
gently
zesty
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
combination
of
its
exceptionally
fine
and
natural
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
but
it
becomes
more
cottony
and
lightly
creamy
as
it
warms
across
the
palate
the
flavor
delivers
everything
that
the
aroma
promises
with
some
lightly
fruity
and
sweetish
malt
upfront
a
softer
maltiness
and
floral
hop
flavor
across
the
middle
solid
rising
bitterness
towards
the
swallow
and
a
distinctly
dry
and
bitter
finish
thats
heightened
by
a
wash
of
peppery
drying
alcohol
it
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
hot
and
peppery
alcohol
amidst
the
occasional
reminder
of
sweet
honeyish
malt
or
floral
hops
its
quite
charming
and
leans
towards
a
dangerous
level
of
drinkability

the
alcohol
is
noticeable

let

overall
a
good

a
good
take
on
a
classic
tasted
a
bit
like
a
fruity

really
good
o
a
really
unusual

youd
taste
in

carbonation
was
present
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
really
enjoyed
the
dry
earthy
after
taste
i
could
easily
put
this
down
with
a
sushi
roll
and
enjoy
the
complimenting
flavorings
in
a
nutshell
it
like
was
a
bastard
child
of
a
wheat
or
sake
and
an
ale
i
had
no
problem
giving
it
a
home
with
me
overall
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
good
and
interesting
ill
revisit
this
one
again
hmmm
not
brilliant
that
said
the
age
of
the
bottle
probably
doesnt
help
looks
ok
if
rather
cloudy
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
pretty
lacklustre
husky
malt
and
stewed
leaves
are
the
main
course
body
is
alright
and
relatively
thick
drinkable
but
unexciting
it
just
doesnt
have
that
much
going
for
it
no
need
to
seek
it
out
o
this
is
it
excellent
accompaniment
for
sushi
this
was
an
outlier
this
is
usually
a
bit
more
sparkling
and
crisp
but
still
nectary
more
vibrant
fruitiness
always
a
treat
though
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
youve
never
had
it
pours
a
nice
orange
red
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
has
a
great
aroma
lots
of
dark
sediment
which
i
assume
is
the
red
rice
this
is
a
living
beer
what
is
so
great
is
that
the
bubbles
continuously
move
the
rice
particles
around
cool
nice
slightly
sweet
smell
good
taste
with
the
slightest
of
sweetness
at
the
backend
due
to
the
rice
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
lots
of
substance
o
i
was
anticipating
a
sake
tasting
beer
but
this
is
nothing
of
the
sort
it
is
however
quite
interesting
and
i
think
its
quirky
beers
like
this
that
are
going
to
put
japan
on
the
craft
beer
map
instead
of
their
middle
of
the
road
faux
american
stuff
very
mundane
version
of
belgium
pale
ale
meets
the
basic
description
but
nothing
special
unless
you
consider
that
its
made
with
red
rice
o
very
unique
a
curious
beer
for
the
curiously
minded
neat
find
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
ive
had
to
date
and
could
almost
be
its
own
style
if
oatmeal
stout
is
sufficiently
different
to
qualify
as
distinct
a
beer
made
with
red
rice
and
sake
yeast
damn
straight
qualifies
as
well
dont
get
me
wrong
it
does
have
some
belgian
character
this
brew
is
an
unusual
color
that
i
can
best
describe
as
red
apple
juice
not
quite
as
sparkly
as
the
darker
pale
ales
and
ipas
with
a
decent
quantity
of
noticeably
large
white
bubbles
smells
like
nutty
malt
rich
sweet
yeast
and
fermented
honey
along
with
some
banana
and
spice
esters
the
taste
diverges
from
belgian
though
butterscotch
and
strawberry
vanilla
custard
again
with
a
hint
of
banana
with
a
pungent
nuttiness
like
wild
rice
the
unique
grist
is
really
adding
something
distinct
to
the
flavor
although
not
aggressively
boozy
the
latter
does
reveal
itself
over
time
i
can
also
detect
some
floral
grassy
hops
in
the
middle
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
there
is
a
sakelike
graininess
that
scrubs
the
palate
clean
after
each
sip
wow
fruity
and
yet
still
quite
dry
with
the
wild
rice
nuttiness
persisting
right
up
until
the
finish
this
one
is
a
keeper
and
ignore
the
price
point
try
it
at
least
once
the
head
is
just
fabulous
copious
amounts
and
decent
lacing
hazy
light
golden
fluid
with
a
few
specks
here
and
there
aroma
is
light
bodied
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
yeast
sweet
honey
notes
flow
in
bring
out
the
light
malt
taste
is
flat
out
great
red
rice
malt
gives
the
flavors
of
light
pilsner
malt
and
its
sweet
grain
character
subtle
amounts
of
light
fruits
from
apples
to
a
hint
of
strawberry
and
bubblegum
trace
honey
and
mild
pepper
lead
into
a
dry
finish
with
a
mild
saaz
hop
signature
super
mellow
belgian
yeast
presence
that
ties
it
all
together
the
belgofruit
notes
are
here
but
in
mild
form
as
with
the
funk
i
mentioned
the
dry
finish
it
is
hard
to
do
it
justice
as
it
is
perfect
and
delicately
done
a
super
quenching
and
refreshing
beer
that
begs
you
to
quaff
as
much
as
you
like
while
packing
a
respectable
alcohol
wallop
feel
is
light
and
creamy
in
the
carbonation
with
a
just
right
weight
to
the
liquid
light
and
supple
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
session
ale
ive
had
period
flat
out
great
beer
i
may
not
fir
they
typical
bspa
profile
but
wow
is
to
good
overall
its
okay
nothing
i
think
id
buy
again
but
nothing
i
regretted
trying
7
is
an
admirable
level
of
alcohol
the
taste
continues
the
theme
of
bizarre
and
intriguing
it
is
absolutely
on
the
sour
side
with
a
fungusy
yeast
tone
but
an
oddly
familiar
flavour
right
behind
it
it
tastes
like
youre
chewing
on
a
flower
i
want
to
say
honeysuckle
it
has
an
obvious
sweetness
to
it
while
not
seeming
all
that
sugary
it
has
a
very
smooth
thin
mouthfeel
which
unfortunately
means
no
fun
but
the
thin
smoothness
goes
well
with
the
sweet
flowery
flavour
despite
this
the
alcohol
is
oddly
not
present
its
7
and
has
just
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
to
hide
behind
along
with
a
very
present
funky
yeast
flavour
im
not
sure
why
it
doesnt
taste
hotter
as
a
fan
of
alcohol
flavour
im
a
little
disappointed
but
its
hard
to
be
when
this
beer
is
such
an
allaround
treat
it
is
very
out
there
very
different
from
what
ive
had
before
and
very
outofthebox
experience
mo
refreshing
on
the
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
the
flavour
profile
is
quite
simple
yet
fragrant
and
nice
while
the
alc
content
is
definitely
there
to
assert
its
presence
without
any
pretentiousness
all
in
all
a
very
fragrant
and
distinctive
beer
worth
tasting
once
in
a
life
time
really
o
pretty
weak
smell
but
allaround
a
decent
beer
overall
this
beer
was
so
good
i
went
out
and
bought
a
case
from
dq
in
houston
jd
overall
again
this
is
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
i
actually
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
white
ale
from
hitachino
nest
despite
it
being
the
highest
rated
japanese
beer
period
too
spicy
for
my
liking
but
this
little
gem
is
a
keeper
its
perhaps
the
most
difficult
beer
to
describe
and
break
down
in
terms
of
smell
and
flavor
but
it
is
quite
amazing
even
at
its
price
point
its
worth
having
when
you
can
one
of
my
favs
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
these
beers
from
hitachinos
nest
beers
keep
an
eye
out
and
give
them
a
try
o
for
a
beer
that
uses
adjuncts
this
beer
has
an
interesting

seems
a
bit

brain
sensory

overload
or
bsao
for

specifically
a

would
be

with
this
brew
overall
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
beer
and
will
be
trying
other
hitachino
brews
very
soon
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
well
hidden
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
interesting
that
it
is
made
with
red
rice
bottle
it
pours
an
offwhite
head
over
a
hazy
dark
golden
body
the
label
says
it
should
have
a
pink
tint
the
aroma
is
mostly
fruity
but
theres
also
a
little
touch
of
cooked
rice
in
a
pleasant
way
that
is
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
some
berries
and
some
sweet
pale
malts
as
a
base
medium
to
full
body
feeling
a
bit
papery
the
finish
has
a
balancing
bitterness
a
nice
one
unusual
but
nice
amazing
with
sushi
drinkability
taste
okay
i
guess
wont
return
to
it
though
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
but
it
fell
short
in
all
other
categories
honestly
not
worth
the
5
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
overall
quite
enjoyable
id
have
it
again
but
i
wont
spend
time
seeking
it
out
o
this
doesnt
try
to
hit
you
with
well
any
of
itself
its
very
balanced
and
satisfying
it
seems
like
a
lighter
kind
of
brew
but
leaves
a
warmth
thats
very
satisfying
definitely
drink
again
when
a
more
subtle
beers
called
for
11
2
ounce
bottle
served
in

snifter
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark

color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite

that
that
didnt
stay
around
for
too
long
theres
also
a
decent

of

aroma
is
bready

rice
raspberries
strawberries
and
some

it
tastes

a

flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount

i
think
its
a
solid
overall
brew
but
nothing
about
this
really
impressed
me
at
all
but
with
that
being
said
id
certainly
drink
it
again
and
it
is
worth
trying
a
unique
brew
to
be
sure
glad
i
tried
it
when
i
had
the
chance
o
quite
different
and
glad
i
tried
it
check
it
out
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
cloudy
golden
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
there
are
aromas
of
rice
and
yeast
there
is
a
mild
alcohol
smell
as
well
as
some
sweet
malts
there
are
flavors
from
the
rice
and
the
yeast
like
a
previous
reviewer
said
this
does
remind
me
of
cooked
rice
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
i
can
also
taste
some
of
the
malt
and
some
alcohol
kick
there
is
some
citrus
tartness
to
this
as
well
its
definitely
interesting
in
the
flavor
department
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
abundant
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
drinks
fairly
well
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
overpriced
for
what
it
is
i
probably
wouldnt
purchase
this
one
again
but
you
might
like
it
more
than
i
did
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
finallya
kiuchi
beer
that
i
enjoy
i
dont
know
whether
ive
gotten
unlucky
with
badold
bottles
up
until
now
but
i
did
not
enjoy
their
white
ale
espresso
stout
or
sweet
stout
im
really
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
shot
though
very
tasty
and
wellbalanced
a
great
beer
to
try
if
youre
wanting
something
a
bit
different
cloudy
goldenamber
body
with
a
big
yeast
load
and
a
soapy
white
head
unusual
and
distinct
aroma
reminds
me
of
cocoa
nuts
guava
and
cherry
plus
an
underlying
adjunct
signature
lightly
sweet
waxy
flavor
with
rye
notes
and
hop
characters
suggesting
dry
tea
leaves
also
has
some
acidity
as
if
from
tart
berries
finish
is
drying
and
moderately
bitter
interesting
beer
the
palate
is
so
light
crisp
and
fresh
this
must
be
the
rice
zinging
across
teh
palate
with
hints
of
sourness
balanced
really
well
with
that
crisp
malt
and
just
enough
bitterness
in
teh
finish
unusual
and
very
refreshing
and
delicious
this
is
a
great
and
much
more
flavorful
alternative
quaffer
to
go
with
your
yakitori
or
grilled
hamachi
collar
i
wish
more
japanese
places
would
serve
it
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
yet
crisp
with
a
light
body
light
crisp
carbonation
and
a
light
feel
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
this
went
down
smooth
and
easy
hiding
the
abv
very
well
a
very
nice
beer
that
was
quite
enjoyable
and
very
different
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
really
wouldnt
consider
it
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
though
but
is
was
tasty
and
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
me
with
its
unusual
brews
this
poured
out
with
a
really
cool
looking
red
color
it
almost
looks
artifical
the
head
is
fizzy
and
with
a
pinkish
color
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
decent
i
wasnt
really
able
to
get
much
out
of
the
aroma
on
this
beer
besides
some
light
spicy
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
bit
on
the
spicy
side
with
some
sweet
malts
in
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
drinkable
overall
i
thought
the
beer
looked
really
cool
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
kind
of
a
let
down
i
would
still
drink
it
again
though
this
is
the
first
rice
based
beer
that
ive
actually
enjoyed
good
flavors
and
the
body
actually
holds
up
well
its
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
not
bad
certainly
worth
a
try
interesting
to
say
the
least
though
probably
not
a
repeat
purchase
overall
drinkability
neat
to
try
out
at
first
when
i
had
this
i
thought
that
putting
into
the
category
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
was
incorrect
but
as
i
drink
more
of
it
i
think
thats
a
reasonable
place
for
this
beer
which
is
distinctly
japanese
and
very
unique
in
flavor
and
style
glad
to
try
but
not
sure
i
would
call
this
highly
drinkable
its
an
acquired
taste
interesting
challenging
to
define
delicate
and
complex
and
to
that
end
good
overall
but
i
cant
see
myself
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
still
as
i
look
at
the
other
ratings
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
so
despite
my
counterarguments
on
only
trying
it
once
ill
rate
this
as
good
overall
very
interesting
beer
i
would
drink
this
if
i
was
out
having
sushi
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
i
give
two
schlitz
for
this
awesomely
unique
ale
from
japan
had
this
at
an
asian
restaurant
in
boston
pours
a
reddish
brown
tint
with
little
to
no
head
in
the
nose
i
was
picking
up
some
malt
sweetness
and
dried
fruit
aromas
the
taste
was
very
floral
with
a
little
tartness
as
well
pleasantly
light
cant
tell
this
is
a
7
abv
beer
the
rice
really
comes
through
in
the
finish
as
an
avid
sake
drinker
i
really
enjoyed
this
thebeeralmanac
com
very
nice
poured
into
a
nondescript
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazy
orangepeach
color
with
a
goldenhued
fluffy
head
that
retained
well
throughout
the
session
aroma
was
pretty
much
what
id
expect
sweet
rice
to
smell
like
notes
of
citrus
zest
a
bit
grassy
nice
crisp
taste
somewhat
reminiscent
of
sake
up
front
with
tones
of
lemon
zest
apple
skin
peach
and
white
grapes
just
a
touch
of
sourness
bready
and
grassy
very
light
and
enjoyable
lightbodied
and
very
drinkable
pours
an
appetizing
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
fairly
thick
finebubbled
light
tan
head
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
and
a
teeny
bit
fruity
if
not
strong
flavor
is
hmmm
this
is
interesting
not
malty
really
rather
fruity
quite
different
from
other
beers
i
have
tried
not
sweet
and
not
bitter
just
tasty
some
yeasty
hints
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
aboveaverage
body
an
interesting
beer
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
was
challenged
by
my
guy
at
the
beer
store
to
enjoy
it
and
i
did
its
not
great
but
im
glad
i
finally
had
my
first
kiuchi
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
good
bit
the
taste
is
really
great
very
subtle
but
complex
and
well
balanced
i
think
im
in
the
wrong
season
for
it
though
first
time
i
had
seen
single
12
oz
available
so
i
picked
it
up
would
enjoy
this
in
the
summer
months
a
little
more
i
think
this
has
everything
i
love
in
a
belgian
beer
i
am
not
good
with
adjectives
but
this
beer
has
what
i
like
overall
this
beer
was
interesting
as
an
experiment
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
this
price
point
as
a
side
note
it
didnt
exactly
scream
sake
to
me
but
im
not
a
connoisseur
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
little
gem
of
an
ale
the
rice
really
adds
a
lot
without
masking
or
detracting
from
the
inherent
quality
of
the
base
beer
it
tastes
authentically
japanese
since
it
is
and
not
artificial
like
many
of
the
american
attempts
at
this
or
similar
japanese
styles
a
must
try
if
nothing
else
so
you
can
say
you
had
a
red
rice
ale
o
im
not
sure
if
my
taste
buds
changed
over
time
or
if
the
freshly
imported
batch
tastes
different
than
what
id
had
previously
but
i
was
stricken
how
different
it
was
from
what
i
remembered
however
i
still
love
this
ale
i
relish
any
opportunity
to
taste
this
fine
complex
ale
as
often
as
i
am
able
it
is
just
superb
orangish

poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
moderately
hazy
brownamber
beer
with
a
very
small
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
vinous
very
fruity
with
some
sweet
malt
flavor
is
not
terrible
but
not
very
interesting
either
strong
sweet
malt
with
moderately
high
bitterness
not
even
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
though
alcohol
is
lightly
hot
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
highly
fruity
yeast
character
as
the
aroma
indicated
ive
had
sekihan
but
this
doesnt
resemble
the
flavor
far
as
i
remember
do
they
mean
purple
rice
it
doesnt
taste
like
that
either
i
dont
think
the
rice
contributes
much
to
the
flavor
but
im
not
sure
absent
the
label
i
would
have
guessed
this
is
just
a
strong
undistinguished
ale
overall
unique
with
some
complex
attributes
decent
abv
very
pleasant
to
drink
o
an
interesting
beer
pretty
tasty
didnt
know
it
was
a
bspa
until
i
logged
onto
ba
when
i
got
home
kind
of
surprised
me
but
wasnt
sure
what
style
i
thought
it
would
be
anyway
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
oh
and
it
features
a
cartoon
owl
on
the
label
so
that
immediately
boosts
the
score
right
there
o
a
very
good
beer
unlike
anything
i
have
every
had
very
drinkable
almost
sessionable
which
is
remarkable
given
the
abv
finish
short
but
full
of
burst
sweetness
and
some
light
hops
at
he
end
truly
an
achievement
the
reddishpinkish
hue
right
off
the
back
is
pretty
unique
to
this
beer
nice
lite
sweet
smell
and
very
pleasent
taste
make
this
a
good
session
beer
def
must
try
if
this
is
available
in
your
area
o
im
not
sure
this
beer
really
knows
what
it
is
or
wants
to
be
so
many
things
going
on
here
without
any
one
thing
taking
the
lead
in
the
flavors
i
feel
like
i
could
come
up
with
new
descriptors
for
the
flavors
in
here
all
night
long
i
give
this
high
scores
for
uniqueness
and
and
a
fun
and
different
drinking
experience
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
suppose
it
is
a
bit
of
a
catchall
sort
of
category
and
i
dont
really
have
a
better
idea
what
to
call
it
but
it
isnt
like
any
other
one
ive
ever
had
tasty
and
a
bit
confounding
worth
a
try
nothing
great
to
say
about
this
beer
nothing
bad
either
it
just
did
not
make
an
impact
either
way
for
me
pretty
light
flavor
with
an
odd
undertone
would
drink
just
fine
very
cold
so
maybe
a
good
one
to
have
after
doing
some
yard
work
my
wife
thought
the
bottle
was
cute
o
very
interesting
and
will
stick
out
in
my
mind
and
im
likely
to
return
to
the
novelty
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
si
meduim
light
and
the
finish
is
a
little
long
this
is
a
good
beer
wonderful
flavors
and
well
balanced
i
really
enjoyed
the
crispness
of
the
beer
at
the
end
d
i
could
bath
in
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
salty
sake
and
rice
in
the
taste
sweet
rice
malty
almost
like
a
really
sweet
red
ale
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
dry
rice
malt
in
the
aftertaste
ok
sweet
taste
hides
the
7
i
sincerely
hope
this
was
a
bad
bottle
as
it
seems
most
others
have
really
liked
it
but
this
was
just
not
good
looking
for
something
else
overall
i
have
to
admit
this
is
my
kiuchi
beer
and
im
very
impressed
most
of
the
european
and
american
beers
that
ive
had
have
a
similar
taste
or
feel
with
their
own
unique
spin
not
hitachino
red
rice
ale
the
unique
taste
and
even
more
unique
smell
is
worth
the
price
alone
yes
indeed
what
is
to
say
this
is
a
fantastically
unique
beer
that
really
has
some
interesting
points
i
cant
say
its
something
id
enjoy
regularly
but
kiuchi
have
come
up
with
something
yet
again
as
they
did
with
their
cedaraged
japanese
classic
ale
that
is
unique
and
memorable
not
my
thing
but
starts
to
grow
on
you
probably
wont
be
revisiting
though
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
by
far
the
mellowest
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
like
the
beer
because
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
really
doesnt
have
much
flavor
going
on
maybe
i
have
been
drinking
too
many
beers
with
a
big
kick
in
your
mouth
flavor
maybe
this
is
one
of
those
good
normal
beers
that
the
latest
beer
advocate
magazine
is
talking
about
where
you
dont
need
to
have
these
extreme
flavors
so
overall
i
like
the
beer
and
i
really
have
not
faults
at
all
with
it
i
would
like
to
buy
this
again
after
a
while
and
see
if
i
have
the
same
results
d
stuff
is
pretty
solid
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
here
there
is
a
very
unique
flavor
profile
going
on
here
with
the
rice
and
some
fun
crazy
semidark
fruit
flavours
great
mouthfeel
on
this
stuff
id
try
it
again
the
high
carbonation
not
only
lifted
the
ale
off
the
palate
nicely
but
aided
drinkability
and
kept
the
mouthfeel
very
light
this
did
not
taste
like
7
abv
the
drinkability
reminded
me
a
lot
of
duvel
although
the
hop
character
is
very
different
between
the
two
beers
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
it
and
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
unique
beer
t
the
rice
is
definitely
there
comes
through
with
an
almost
sakelike
flavor
slight
earthiness
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
for
some
reason
i
got
the
idea
in
my
head
that
it
tasted
like
budweiser
and
that
kind
of
killed
the
experience
for
me
its
still
a
good
beer
and
undoubtedly
better
than
bud
d
an
unusual
yet
totally
drinkable
take
on
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
final
thoughts
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
intriguing
brew
i
mean
rice
it
seems
like
such
an
obvious
ingredient
for
beer
but
you
almost
never
encounter
it
this
was
unique
for
sure
but
didnt
wow
me
the
flavors
were
nice
though
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
kiuchi
note
their
website
states
that
it
uses
a
sake
yeast
drinkable
easy
to
down
this
i
dont
know
if
it
has
sorachi
hops
but
the
tangy
is
refreshing
not
sure
it
fills
my
beer
lust
but
its
a
plus
for
unusual
while
not
being
nasty
d
so
unusual
and
approachable
that
it
makes
you
want
more
very
nice
offering
ill
be
on
the
look
out
for
other
products
from
this
brewery
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
i
could
easily
sit
on
this
beer
all
night
if
funds
were
not
a
problem
very
easy
and
satisfying
to
drink
d
clearly
a
unique
brew
whatever
the
red
rice
is
i
think
it
is
giving
it
that
expensive
but
a
solid
effort
and
well
worth
a
try
cheers
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
its
interesting
but
i
doubt
id
go
it
again
bottle
solicited
from
mediya
japanese
supermarket
liang
court
at
clarke
quay
singapore
drinkability
just
a
weird
beer
although
i
did
warm
up
to
it
after
a
little
while
plus
it
did
go
well
with
the
sushi
i
was
having
the
light
flavours
could
really
use
higher
carbonation
drinkability
well
this
beer
is
far
from
perfect
but
it
has
enough
interesting
characteristics
to
keep
it
refreshing
though
i
wont
be
pounding
it
all
night
pretty
decent
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
amber
color
with
very
little
head
at
first
glance
you
might
mistake
this
brew
for
a
barleywine
the
aroma
is
very
floral
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
front
of
the
palate
is
met
with
a
slight
hop
note
followed
by
a
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
has
notes
of
hibiscus
flowers
this
beverage
goes
down
so
smooth
especially
for
having
a
slightly
higher
abv
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
tried
medium
bodied
with
low
but
effective
carbonation
this
was
unique
and
decent
but
nothing
id
flock
back
to
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
didnt
really
seem
to
fit
in
a
specific
category
both
the
fruit
and
the
malts
were
subtle
and
it
would
have
been
entirely
forgettable
if
not
for
the
fine
carbonation
not
worth
seeking
out
but
its
not
worth
turning
down
either
anyone
with
an
introduction
to
good
sake
and
a
taste
for
good
beer
should
appreciate
this
beer
i
can
see
where
some
of
the
lower
marks
for
this
beer
come
from
it
has
an
overall
character
that
puts
it
a
notch
away
from
the
beers
most
people
have
tried
it
has
a
tartness
organic
character
and
floral
quality
that
is
unique
and
to
me
very
enjoyable
pours
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disapates
to
nothing
but
some
clingy
bubbles
in
the
glass
i
smell
fruit
strawberry
and
sne
other
tart
fruit
bubble
gum
lager
yeast
character
sweet
oak
apple
tastes
like
tart
strawberry
lager
grainy
notes
drys
out
on
the
finish
medium
carbing
light
body
quite
drinkable
for
this
abv
not
for
this
a
really
nice
and
rather
uncommon
beer
the
fruity
tones
mixed
very
well
with
sushi
at
raw
in
stockholm
this
slightly
reminds
me
of
a
regular
budweiser
but
with
real
flavor
i
never
agreed
with
them
using
rice
in
their
beer
but
this
example
is
better
i
think
budweiser
lovers
may
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
transition
to
better
beers
the
flavor
is
up
front
and
fades
quickly
to
almost
no
aftertaste
taste
rice
and
starch
dominate
crisp
fruity
and
moderate
bitterness
kind
of
a
chalky
and
herbal
taste
very
unusual
the
beer
pours
a
redorangebrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
smoke
toffee
tobacco
leather
and
toasted
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
i
still
get
a
lot
of
tobacco
and
smoke
but
i
also
get
some
meaty
notes
there
is
also
some
rice
grass
and
fruit
notes
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
wish
this
wasnt
5
dollars
a
bottle
where
i
live
i
would
gladly
switch
hit
between
this
and
noble
pils
all
the
time
this
beer
had
a
great
color
clear
and
red
the
rice
flavor
was
present
and
reminded
me
of
saki
the
carbonation
was
foamy
and
good
and
i
could
easily
sit
back
all
summer
and
drink
this
by
the
fireside
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
reddish
color
ale
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
and
light
sugar
with
dry
malt
base
if
somewhat
unique
taste
is
also
a
strange
mix
between
ester
with
a
balance
sweet
malt
base
the
grain
bill
is
definitely
unique
as
i
had
never
tasted
red
rice
before
body
is
bit
light
with
good
carbonation
and
alcohol
is
really
not
apparent
interesting
experiment
and
definably
something
i
would
drink
more
then
once
d
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
try
again
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
pale
roselovely
colour
with
a
light
head
and
delicate
lacing
aromas
are
sweet
yeasty
and
sligtly
candied
in
a
soft
raspberry
gummy
lolly
kind
of
way
the
rice
adds
an
almost
sake
dimension
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
still
for
its
lightmedium
body
there
is
plenty
of
sweet
malt
and
sake
phenolic
flavour
alongside
light
fruit
flavours
while
managing
to
finish
dry
an
adventurous
beer
that
succeeds
drinkable
but
seems
more
like
a
light
english
pale
ale
recommended
this
is
a
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
theres
no
reason
not
to
try
it
and
quite
a
few
reasons
why
you
should
very
unique
beer
and
its
a
little
confusing
at
times
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
is
most
certainly
a
unique
and
inventive
ale
its
also
not
too
hard
to
put
back
even
if
that
dryness
goes
a
long
way
d
pretty
drinkable
this
is
certainly
an
outside
the
box
sort
of
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
not
bad
carbonation
but
i
dont
think
id
have
this
too
often
its
just
a
bit
weird
comes
in
a
bottle
with
a
whimsical
label
featuring
an
owl
or
maybe
some
kind
of
native
japanese
snow
fowl
the
most
striking
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
color
other
reviewers
call
it
amber
but
i
swear
this
stuff
has
a
deep
magenta
tinge
to
it
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
floating
around
in
it
like
a
snowglobe
i
assume
this
is
the
reason
for
the
snowy
owl
on
the
label
and
this
beer
if
nothing
else
looks
really
great
didnt
like
the
smell
which
i
can
only
say
struck
me
as
a
sour
pilsner
smell
taste
was
not
bad
different
somehow
which
i
guess
is
the
rice
but
just
pretty
soso
pricey
and
not
something
ill
necessarily
seek
out
in
the
future
but
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
has
been
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
drank
its
really
in
a
style
all
of
its
own
kinda
weird
but
still
enjoyable
its
still
worth
a
try
sometime
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
has
about
an
inch
an
a
half
of
head
i
just
love
this
color
it
has
a
dirty
quality
to
it
an
excellent
mixture
of
flavors
first
you
get
that
orangey
zest
which
is
just
perfect
and
then
you
taste
the
wheat
although
a
little
pricey
56
i
believe
it
is
well
worth
it
once
you
snap
off
the
cap
the
smell
alone
will
intrigue
you
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
that
smell
the
red
rice
the
orangey
smell
the
wheatits
damn
enticing
i
will
definitely
purchase
more
of
these
in
the
near
future
first
up
is
the
red
rice
and
holy
this
beer
has
the
most
unusual
smelling
beer
ive
come
across
my
best
attempt
to
sum
up
the
aroma
is
that
it
smells
like
an
alcoholic
starchy
fruit
gummy
bear
yeah
its
weird
but
very
alluring
add
an
orangetangerinepeachy
colour
to
this
you
have
a
oneofakind
beer
it
doesnt
disappoint
it
tastes
less
like
a
gummy
bear
than
youd
think
from
the
smell
and
that
general
fruit
flavour
turns
in
to
a
strawberrylike
flavour
toss
in
some
yeastiness
and
some
graininess
then
some
toasted
rice
and
an
almost
earthilike
quality
and
you
get
kiuchis
hitachino
nest
red
rice
only
the
japanese
could
produce
something
so
weird
yet
so
good
d
goes
down
easy
with
a
great
mouth
feel
and
decent
amount
of
flavor
definitely
a
unique
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
am
really
suprised
it
doesnt
really
taste
7
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
well
concealed
interestingly
tasty
beer
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
me
d
drinkable
sure
but
meh
nothing
too
pushing
either
way
very
impressed
with
this
as
my
first
try
from
the
brewery
a
bold
move
from
the
brewer
im
still
trying
to
work
out
how
this
is
classed
is
as
a
bspa
as
to
be
honest
ive
never
tried
a
bspa
that
has
been
brewed
with
rice
anyways
onto
the
brew
itself
it
pours
a
deep
guava
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
three
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
aroma
is
fruityfruity
riceit
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
grapefruitcococnutcreamy
rice
and
vanilla
all
coming
thru
on
tastesuprisingly
enough
i
really
dig
this
brew
it
is
definately
out
there
but
yet
still
a
beer
and
to
be
honest
i
couldnt
compare
it
to
any
other
brew
that
i
have
triedif
you
havnt
seen
or
tried
i
definately
recommend
was
expecting
more
from
the
hitachino
family
of
beers
especially
after
having
just
discovered
their
white
ale
which
i
now
adore
it
poured
an
interesting
reddish
brown
color
with
minimal
head
smell
was
thin
a
little
sour
and
not
very
sweet
taste
was
a
cross
between
a
belgian
and
a
saporro
not
sure
but
it
wasnt
the
best
and
it
was
a
little
dirty
tasting
too
maybe
i
just
wasnt
expecting
the
strawhay
components
to
come
through
in
this
stylebrand
of
beer
id
have
it
again
but
it
wasnt
a
favorite
unique
to
my
beer
tasting
history
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
it
too
often
style
correction
this
beer
is
not
a
belgian
strong
pale
it
is
a
rice
beer
25of
grain
bill
fermented
with
an
ale
and
sake
yeast
im
definitely
loving
the
hitachino
nest
beers
each
one
is
so
unique
i
dont
believe
i
will
be
buying
any
more
of
this
brew
its
not
terrible
but
both
this
as
well
as
a
couple
others
have
now
left
me
pretty
blah
about
hitachino
nest
in
general
d
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
that
i
often
bring
to
byob
asian
places
pairs
great
with
food
but
not
something
i
usually
drink
by
itself
it
might
be
worth
noting
that
this
beer
might
be
better
than
my
score
reflects
too
for
me
it
was
great
at
first
but
i
got
bored
of
it
plus
im
not
sure
that
it
would
be
worthwhile
as
a
standalone
brew
outside
of
a
food
pairing
a
very
satisfying
well
balanced
and
interesting
in
its
mirror
world
character
strong
yeasty
ale
another
hitachino
offering
that
defies
current
ba
classification
i
suppose
this
would
require
the
existence
of
a
japanese
rice
ale
category
or
the
like
one
better
befitting
this
beer
than
any
particular
belgian
shoehorning
that
seems
to
be
going
on
here
drinkability
hitachino
brews
are
always
so
damn
expensive
and
unfortunately
this
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
its
interesting
and
easy
drinking
but
i
feel
like
the
complexity
is
lacking
again
maybe
this
isnt
meant
to
be
cellared
though
it
was
by
accident
in
some
ways
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
but
am
i
going
to
pay
5
to
see
what
the
deal
is
im
not
sure
as
i
poured
i
noticed
a
pink
tone
in
the
beer
the
head
is
impressive
but
fades
quickly
and
there
is
very
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
pink
in
the
pour
turned
to
a
pink
copper
color
in
the
glass
there
is
a
creamyness
on
the
tongue
that
is
very
pleasant
the
alcohol
does
not
show
through
as
i
thought
it
might
in
a
light
beer
the
red
rice
really
comes
through
well
the
rice
adds
a
distinct
body
when
used
as
the
primary
ingredient
all
around
a
very
nice
beer
interesting
beer
that
certainly
doesnt
feel
like
a
belgian
ale
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
a
different
take
on
a
rice
beer
wow
really
mixed
feelings
on
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
almost
yellow
with
massive
white
head
i
mean
massive
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
was
very
tart
and
sour
i
thought
some
tangy
fruit
and
some
yeast
as
well
taste
was
somewhat
bland
it
was
sweet
a
little
tart
and
slightly
fruity
but
i
thought
nothing
really
took
over
and
i
scored
it
low
because
for
a
belgian
pale
this
was
far
too
sour
i
thought
wasnt
sweet
enough
mouthfeel
was
good
light
and
crisp
overall
it
wasnt
terrible
just
dont
know
how
well
it
fit
the
style
im
all
for
taking
liberties
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
bit
too
many
here
overall
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
if
i
couldnt
acquire
any
more
of
this
one
but
i
enjoyed
it
nontheless
a
unique
taste
and
feel
for
us
americans
this
was
a
visual
beer
poets
speak
of
drinking
in
her
loveliness
with
their
eyes
i
was
drinking
this
beer
with
mine
eyes
that
way
it
was
less
physically
intoxicating
the
finger
of
head
with
good
retention
had
a
pinkish
cast
to
it
very
different
in
my
experience
the
beers
color
was
a
hazy
reddishpink
which
suddenly
put
me
in
mind
of
the
disaster
area
that
is
chelada
the
nose
was
cotton
candylike
in
its
sweetness
like
strawberries
and
sugar
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
this
guy
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
definite
strawberry
presence
on
the
tongue
much
more
drinkable
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
finish
had
the
same
cotton
candy
quality
that
i
had
noted
on
the
nose
not
bad
but
a
little
too
sweet
overall
for
my
taste
this
was
an
interesting
beverage
but
simply
too
sweet
something
new
that
i
wont
be
trying
again
word
of
warning
theres
a
lot
of
sludge
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
be
careful
when
pouring
the
beer
was
reddish
with
an
amber
tint
the
offwhite
cap
produced
some
fine
lacing
and
showed
good
head
retention
the
aroma
was
interesting
a
bit
nutty
with
cereal
notes
a
bit
of
dried
rice
character
and
sweet
malt
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
a
bit
of
caramel
it
was
quite
sweet
and
reminded
me
of
japanese
candy
light
to
medium
bodied
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
very
dry
quite
an
interesting
brew
it
seriously
reminded
me
of
japanese
candy
its
fairly
drinkable
drinkablity
interesting
brew
that
is
full
of
contradictions
hearty
and
refreshing
with
some
qualities
of
a
sour
ale
one
of
a
kind
taste
is
not
too
pleasant
kind
of
harsh
and
leaves
a
deli
meat
after
taste
im
not
really
sure
whats
going
on
here
but
its
not
a
great
taste
its
a
bit
over
carbonated
interesting
to
drink
but
id
go
with
their
white
one
over
this
d
kind
of
weak
the
flavors
are
muddy
and
there
is
nothing
that
jumps
out
to
make
the
beer
interesting
not
an
awful
beer
just
kind
of
bland
and
certainly
not
up
to
kiuchi
brewerys
normal
standards
d
a
very
unique
beer
give
it
a
try
with
sushi
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
of
course
i
havent
tried
that
many
rice
beers
but
it
definitely
makes
me
want
to
find
more
this
reddish
orange
beer
poured
out
with
a
decent
amount
a
finger
and
half
of
foam
and
reduced
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
floweral
hoppy
and
malt
beer
is
a
good
balance
of
characteristics
the
taste
is
an
amazing
sensation
of
floweral
bit
of
colander
peaking
through
and
taste
of
rice
drinkability
different
beer
good
to
try
something
new
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
definitely
a
different
tasting
beer
in
my
book
personally
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
just
because
i
enjoy
more
traditional
tasting
beers
d
this
was
a
very
different
beer
with
some
interesting
appearance
and
flavor
but
the
metallic
flavor
was
too
much
still
worth
a
try
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
there
are
a
lot
of
light
tastes
in
here
that
sharpness
on
the
tongue
plus
the
novely
of
flavors
high
sugar
presence
makes
me
think
i
couldnt
down
too
many
of
these
this
is
an
interesting
complex
brew
with
something
new
to
offer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
color
is
off
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
but
its
unique
composition
explains
that
very
drinkable
but
watch
the
abv
it
has
a
strawberry
and
peach
flavor
to
it
that
ive
never
really
had
before
quite
unique
and
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
transparent
and
slightly
hazed
pale
golden
orange
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
slightly
sour
in
the
nose
a
little
bit
of
grapefruit
musty
melon
peaches
and
possibly
some
funk
fruity
with
a
pretty
unique
malt
structure
due
in
fact
im
sure
to
the
rice
used
in
the
brewing
process
interesting
beer
nonetheless
just
enough
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
souracidity
lemon
and
grapefruit
skin
and
tart
hard
candy
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
ones
complex
enough
to
keep
me
very
interested
mfd
the
feel
is
great
carbonated
yet
heavy
enough
to
convey
enough
flavour
to
satisfy
even
the
most
discerning
belgian
connoisseurs
hopefully
since
i
really
like
this
beer
the
drink
is
great
something
i
could
have
for
breakfast
lunch
dinner
and
more
the
only
thing
holding
the
feel
back
imo
is
it
is
a
bit
too
piercing
and
crisp
the
carbonation
should
be
bigger
ive
gotta
admit
the
interesting
label
is
what
caught
my
eye
about
this
one
and
made
me
purchase
it
pours
a
pinkishtan
color
one
of
the
oddest
colored
beers
i
might
have
ever
poured
heavily
carbonated
maybe
a
bit
too
much
some
fruity
flavors
are
definitely
tastes
as
well
raspberrystrawberry
like
to
be
specific
has
a
tart
taste
as
well
and
finishes
very
dry
definitely
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
before
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
too
and
is
pretty
drinkable
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
would
never
get
this
again
especially
for
the
price
tag
gotta
love
the
different
beers
across
the
globe
mouth
flavor
is
citrusy
with
some
mild
berry
notes
some
peppery
spicing
and
an
earthy
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
carbonation
is
a
bit
coarse
and
theres
a
bit
too
much
of
it
body
is
just
about
right
not
too
delicate
and
not
too
heavy
finish
is
dry
from
astringency
interesting
beer
but
not
something
im
going
to
revisit
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
a
little
green
appley
and
a
little
yeast
pale
yellow
gold
that
is
a
little
cloudy
with
some
yeast
from
the
bottle
big
foamy
white
head
that
has
staying
power
flavor
is
fruity
with
more
apples
and
yeast
bread
dough
malt
flavors
rice
character
comes
through
in
the
finish
and
keep
the
beer
very
dry
high
carbonation
this
would
be
a
refreshing
summer
beer
d
an
ok
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
but
the
mouthfeel
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
work
for
a
beer
of
such
high
abv
i
was
expecting
a
bit
smoother
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
rather
similar
but
worse
yeasty
sourt
bitter
with
shrap
sulphury
dried
apricots
rancid
pears
and
old
bananas
a
little
straight
cooked
grain
in
the
finish
and
unpleasant
bitter
after
taste
with
sour
metallic
hint
its
very
dry
and
sharp
drinkability
is
great
you
would
never
guess
this
is
8
5
overall
this
is
a
great
combination
of
traditional
traits
as
well
as
an
innovative
take
on
ingredients
i
was
a
little
weary
going
into
this
beer
was
it
worth
4
50ish
for
a
single
it
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
this
will
be
a
nice
splurge
beer
in
the
future
d
yeah
its
made
with
rice
but
this
aint
budweiser
give
it
a
try
d
gets
points
for
uniqueness
and
style
overall
a
solid
good
beer
decent
drinkability
on
tap
this
tasted
like
carbonated
vanilla
syrup
i
left
about
half
the
glass
i
would
be
definitely
down
with
getting
this
at
a
japanese
restaurant
it
seems
like
it
would
pair
nicely
with
eastern
cuisine
always
nice
to
stretch
my
palate
on
some
new
and
different
flavors
this
pours
a
beatuful
red
color
with
four
fingers
of
head
that
disapers
fast
now
that
we
have
talked
about
what
i
liked
we
will
discuss
what
i
dislike
the
taste
is
dry
and
tastes
of
soap
and
a
sour
mash
thieir
also
is
a
bitter
ans
spicy
taste
left
in
my
mouth
that
tingels
my
toung
and
not
in
a
good
way
all
i
can
think
is
that
i
am
chuging
dish
soap
liquid
i
hate
this
one
and
will
never
drink
this
one
agan
i
let
this
warm
and
it
started
tasting
like
dirt
this
is
almost
as
bad
as
it
gets
world
class
have
to
try
the
other
hitachino
they
have
in
thier
cooler
box
i
had
this
beer
recently
for
the
first
time
at
umami
in
san
francisco
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
japanese
restaurants
in
the
city
always
looking
to
try
new
beers
our
server
sold
me
on
this
trendy
red
rice
ale
uh
red
rice
sounded
interesting
i
smelled
hints
of
vanilla
and
orange
and
absolutely
loved
this
beer
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
proper
review
upon
a
second
more
concentrated
and
semiunbiased
review
i
still
enjoyed
it
though
maybe
not
as
much
a
friend
of
mine
nailed
the
smell
of
a
jar
of
green
olives
which
doesnt
sound
appetizing
but
if
you
can
get
past
this
you
may
still
enjoy
this
beer
id
compare
it
to
a
japanese
version
of
a
hefeweisen
definitely
worth
drinking
was
a
nice
accompaniment
to
sushi
enjoy
this
beer
has
a
hazy
light
plum
color
with
a
very
thin
head
my
bottle
was
fairly
settled
but
there
seems
to
be
a
largerthannormal
amount
of
yeast
in
suspension
some
nice
sour
aroma
with
a
little
funkiness
in
it
apparently
from
the
rice
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
has
a
little
underlying
cherry
interesting
beer
not
something
i
wold
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
an
awesome
birthday
present
beer
a
little
bit
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
but
uniquely
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
beer
this
syrupy
the
carbonation
aids
in
that
crisp
finish
this
quality
added
to
the
overall
soft
flavors
makes
for
quite
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
fresh
take
on
the
style
d
not
harsh
just
not
tempting
pretty
good
beer
interesting
flavor
profile
this
actually
would
go
quite
well
with
sushi
or
tempura
good
coversational
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
make
this
a
regular
purchase
quite
interesting
not
entirely
sure
if
its
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
or
blonde
but
whatever
oh
yeah
i
think
its
worth
mentioning
that
this
beer
is
listed
here
at
85abv
and
the
label
on
this
thing
says
70
i
really
like
beers
that
twist
my
expectations
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
moderate
with
moderate
levels
of
alcohol
and
decent
flavors
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
a
little
different
but
still
pretty
good
i
could
see
myself
having
it
again
one
day
it
has
its
time
and
place
i
am
sure
as
a
novelty
its
drinkable
as
a
beer
its
not
great
as
for
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
have
no
idea
what
youre
talking
about
taste
is
fun
but
peculiar
of
belgian
yeast
and
it
seems
maybe
souring
yeast
strains
with
a
funky
grain
and
adjunct
bill
of
something
like
light
malts
caramunich
and
beet
sugar
bill
no
idea
really
but
its
quite
peculiar
but
none
the
less
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
drinkabilty
hmm
ill
revisit
when
there
is
a
desire
for
the
eclectic
with
an
equally
good
level
of
drinkability
and
the
hefty
8
5
abv
wellmasked
behind
a
sweet
flavorful
combination
of
unique
flavors
good
stuff
recommended
the
taste
is
a
flavorful
mix
of
seaweed
wraps
sticky
rice
gummibears
citrus
hops
and
saki
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
crisp
and
leaves
behind
a
fresh
bitter
finish
truly
a
japanese
take
on
a
belgian
style
again
its
not
something
i
can
truly
say
ive
enjoyed
but
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
this
beer
d
if
you
luck
out
and
get
a
small
bottle
like
me
id
say
have
a
second
perhaps
a
third
if
youre
dining
with
friends
or
something
stick
with
one
if
you
get
the
big
whole
foods
bottle
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
keeping
the
rice
element
prevalent
while
this
is
one
of
the
better
rice
ales
that
ive
had
im
really
starting
to
get
turned
off
by
these
beers
as
they
typically
just
dont
seem
to
taste
right
even
though
i
keeping
trying
to
give
them
a
fair
chance
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
with
an
off
white
head
with
pink
tones
nose
is
mild
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
very
slight
touch
of
yeast
as
well
flavor
is
fruity
with
an
odd
ricey
edge
pretty
odd
really
very
earthy
and
plant
like
palate
on
it
very
unusual
feel
is
good
with
a
nice
bubble
to
it
borders
on
syrupy
but
isnt
quite
there
yet
drinkable
sure
its
definitely
a
unique
brew
but
yet
again
not
sure
if
this
one
is
worth
going
back
to
for
the
coin
poured
from
a
720ml
bottle
into
a
conical
pub
glass
nice
light
copper
orange
pour
with
small
to
medium
white
head
very
little
lace
cloudy
with
sediment
floating
about
smell
of
cooked
rice
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
of
orange
and
spice
with
a
hint
of
sake
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
brew
ill
probably
rotate
to
every
few
months
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
it
wasnt
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
is
certainly
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
but
i
doubt
ill
get
it
again
i
still
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
pinkorange
with
a
frothed
white
head
that
leaves
some
near
solid
sheets
of
lace
nose
is
fairly
clean
with
notes
of
cotton
candy
apples
herbs
and
eucalyptis
flavor
starts
off
with
a
sugariness
akin
to
as
already
mentioned
cotton
candy
or
even
doughnut
glaze
towards
the
middle
i
get
some
apple
a
big
hit
of
strawberry
and
some
underlying
mint
finish
is
interestingly
grainy
almost
reminds
me
of
steamed
buckwheat
groats
and
drying
extremely
interesting
but
there
is
the
slightest
cough
medicine
background
note
that
bugs
me
just
a
bit
this
kind
of
tastes
like
strawberry
cream
mad
dog
in
the
best
way
possible
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
carbonation
that
is
arousing
but
never
becomes
bothersome
drinkability
is
really
great
but
there
is
a
sweetness
that
lasts
about
the
middle
that
wears
on
me
very
impressive
ive
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
on
and
off
for
a
few
years
now
and
its
always
interesting
drinkability
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
all
the
time
but
it
wasnt
bad
this
is
interesting
stuff
certainly
unique
but
unfortunately
not
all
that
drinkable
on
any
kind
of
regular
basis
theres
something
lacking
here
which
is
only
partially
made
up
for
with
its
more
unorthodox
characteristics
it
stands
alone
as
ive
never
had
another
beer
like
it
but
probably
wont
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
this
is
a
very
japanese
beer
unless
you
are
familiar
with
japanese
culture
and
foods
i
dont
think
you
would
like
it
recommended
for
a
try
dont
know
if
ill
go
back
to
this
but
i
enjoyed
trying
it
unique
surprisingly
quite
appetizing
on
balance
try
some
with
sushi
t
pours
a
dark
orange
gold
with
a
short
foamy
offwhite
head
nothing
bad
nothing
too
remarkable
odd
smells
herbal
and
medecinal
giving
way
to
green
olives
and
pimentos
taste
has
little
of
the
herbal
smells
but
still
has
some
hints
of
the
olive
juice
there
is
a
nice
balancing
hop
bitterness
but
nothing
too
strong
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
almost
prickly
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
terrific
with
a
nice
bruscetta
and
thick
cut
mozzerella
ill
buy
this
one
again
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
count
this
one
among
your
favorite
session
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
unique
brew
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
more
anytime
soon
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
red
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
settles
to
ring
of
bubbles
smells
like
the
inside
of
a
japanese
restaurant
tastes
fruity
with
an
odd
aftertaste
that
reminds
of
the
flavor
of
some
japanese
red
rice
that
i
had
that
actually
was
flavored
with
red
beans
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
definitely
could
complement
certain
asian
cuisine
i
think
this
could
be
good
with
a
barbecued
pork
bun
for
example
the
red
bean
flavor
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
as
a
flavor
in
beer
and
im
not
sure
i
like
it
so
the
drinkability
score
suffers
somewhat
d
very
good
beer
much
better
than
their
white
ale
appearance
was
a
fairly
deep
red
with
a
medium
amount
of
head
which
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
lightly
fruity
with
some
malt
backbone
to
it
taste
was
somewhat
cedarish
with
a
lot
rye
flavors
mouthfeel
was
grainy
or
chalky
in
its
character
which
i
didnt
particular
care
for
allinall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
didnt
have
an
extraordinarily
high
opinion
of
it
ive
seen
these
around
the
are
and
finally
decided
to
plunk
down
a
few
bucks
for
this
pours
a
deep
redorange
color
quite
different
from
your
average
ale
has
an
odd
grainy
sweet
smell
not
too
overwhelming
tastes
a
bit
like
raw
slightly
musty
grainsrice
some
sweetness
in
the
background
which
finishes
sweet
overall
its
different
but
really
exciting
or
overly
appealing
worth
a
shot
for
people
who
like
to
try
something
different
but
i
cant
see
myself
going
back
to
this
one
drinkability
after
warming
to
near
room
temperature
i
could
almost
manage
to
suck
the
remainder
of
this
down
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
liquid
sushi
too
bad
i
dont
like
sushi
im
sure
that
some
people
will
like
it
but
its
just
not
for
me
this
would
probably
pair
really
well
with
lots
of
japanese
foods
including
sasimi
that
is
if
you
like
sasimi
allinall
an
extremely
interesting
beer
but
one
that
i
obviously
wont
be
buying
again
cheers
d
great
beer
i
enjoyed
mine
with
sushi
and
it
fit
nicely
330ml
brown
bottle
from
jokas
in
waterville
murky
redamber
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
cooked
rice
tastes
sweet
and
grainy
similar
to
wild
rice
flavor
has
hints
of
almost
a
roasty
quality
to
it
not
detecting
any
alcohol
which
surprises
me
rather
fullbodied
im
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
one
not
something
id
have
everyday
but
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
may
get
again
sometime
perhaps
to
pair
with
some
sushi
i
like
this
beer
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
brewerys
wit
im
feeling
the
alcohol
after
a
half
glass
which
went
down
quickly
enough
all
in
all
a
worthatry
brew
the
good
parts
of
this
beer
is
the
appearance
which
is
a
beautiful
color
and
nice
presentation
and
its
drinkability
im
glad
i
engaged
in
a
little
experiment
in
trying
two
of
kiuchis
beers
i
wont
be
experimenting
this
way
again
on
my
own
nickel
i
was
ready
to
drainpour
it
but
ms
warmstorage
likes
it
enough
to
drink
it
just
goes
to
show
how
subjective
taste
is
drinkabilitynote
a
most
excellent
and
enigmatic
example
as
befits
a
belgian
ale
style
brewed
in
japan
well
worth
the
effort
to
obtain
many
thanks
to
ba
hardtarget
for
generously
sharing
this
rare
example
it
smells
like
beer
but
has
a
menthol
coughdroplike
kind
of
taste
about
it
this
isnt
really
a
problem
though
since
much
of
it
is
a
peppering
of
honey
and
ginger
type
lightnessprobably
the
rice
then
again
it
isnt
overly
flavorful
and
flavor
accounts
for
most
of
the
reasons
a
nondrunk
imbibes
in
spirits
yet
its
very
drinkable
smooth
and
includes
an
owl
on
the
bottle
and
afterall
we
are
all
servants
of
moloch
in
this
life
and
next
arent
we
a
very
strange
and
distinct
brew
which
i
frequent
at
four
dollars
for
a
12oz
bottle
when
i
am
feeling
sassy
only
qualm
is
a
little
rough
medicine
quality
weirdgood
overall
ok
my
second
beer
from
hitachino
and
i
havent
been
that
impressed
might
go
well
with
sushi
though
given
its
champagne
like
qualities
drinkability
a
unique
if
slightly
unsettling
beer
experience
its
medicinal
lactic
qualities
arent
too
endearing
to
me
either
ill
stick
to
their
celebration
ale
instead
this
is
a
very
unusual
brew
and
i
am
enjoying
its
uniqueness
without
really
being
able
to
tell
if
i
like
it
i
definately
cant
rate
this
to
style
as
the
style
is
supposedly
a
belgium
strong
ale
and
i
see
smell
nor
taste
anything
even
close
to
belgium
in
this
glass
drinkability
definitely
unique
but
enjoyable
worth
trying
this
one
i
got
this
at
hyvee
not
knowing
what
to
expect
seeing
as
how
real
beer
is
a
luxury
in
japan
it
has
a
delicious
fruity
smell
full
of
spices
like
nutmeg
and
ginger
it
also
has
a
buttery
feel
in
the
nose
a
very
complex
appealing
smell
the
taste
is
kind
of
like
brown
rice
sadly
ive
never
actually
eaten
brown
rice
so
i
wouldnt
know
if
its
similar
it
tastes
sweet
and
well
rounded
i
cant
detect
any
hops
whatsoever
what
are
they
using
for
a
bittering
agent
could
it
be
that
the
rice
can
provide
both
silky
sweetness
and
enough
bitterness
that
hops
are
rendered
unnecessary
i
must
investigate
the
appearance
is
like
rust
thats
the
best
i
can
do
on
that
front
i
dont
really
care
about
that
anyway
as
for
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
it
slides
easily
down
the
throat
and
i
could
drink
it
for
a
long
time
its
just
a
little
expensive
maybe
when
i
go
to
japan
hitachino
nest
red
rice
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
one
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
alcohol
is
noticeable
too
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
some
odd
notes
the
malt
is
quite
noticeable
and
there
is
some
sweetness
but
not
a
lot
a
bit
of
tartness
is
present
too
this
beer
is
fairly
hard
to
describe
it
has
a
light
body
and
there
is
some
alcohol
warming
the
aftertaste
becomes
medicinai
as
the
beer
warms
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
mouthfeel
was
quite
thin
and
over
carbonated
and
did
not
settle
the
beer
seemed
to
turn
to
instant
foam
when
it
hit
my
tongue
this
beer
would
really
be
an
interesting
pair
with
food
maybe
seafood
or
even
a
dessert
that
has
fruit
in
it
arigato
gozaimasu
to
yoshiyuko
sato
for
this
gift
very
drinkable
for
me
that
waxy
rich
taste
keeps
leading
me
down
this
road
very
balanced
and
even
though
fairly
high
abv
no
discernable
alcohol
hazy
pinkish
colored
respectable
white
head
smells
a
bit
spicy
and
definitely
of
sake
distinictly
tastes
of
fermented
rice
ie
sake
with
a
supporting
malt
sweetness
and
noble
hops
really
interesting
and
quite
complex
yeast
dominates
the
flavor
profile
a
bit
spicy
and
creamy
through
the
finish
subdued
fruit
esters
on
the
dry
side
with
bitterness
just
to
balance
light
bodied
and
satisfying
i
love
it
d
interesting
brew
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
im
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
try
it
the
mouth
is
rather
dry
and
somewhat
tart
to
prickly
due
to
the
abundance
of
carbonation
it
really
works
for
this
beer
solid
drinkability
if
only
for
its
unique
yet
pleasing
character
cheers
i
think
this
bottle
is
bad
i
cant
believe
that
anyone
would
purposely
make
a
beer
that
has
an
aftertaste
like
this
and
smells
like
this
the
actual
taste
is
fine
but
getting
to
it
and
afterwards
makes
it
hard
to
like
this
will
try
again
in
a
small
bottle
but
itll
be
awhile
drinkabiliy
a
decent
brew
very
unique
a
strange
sweet
quality
that
i
have
not
tasted
perhaps
good
at
breakfast
with
cereals
hard
to
judge
as
a
pale
ale
drinkability
why
the
description
of
this
persists
as
a
bspa
after
so
many
comments
to
the
contrary
is
a
mystery
this
beer
defies
categorization
but
is
definitely
worthy
of
consideration
i
like
it
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
dont
know
if
its
something
id
reach
for
more
than
once
in
a
blue
moon
but
a
must
try
experience
for
any
beer
drinker
overall
impression
infected
i
dumped
it
this
beer
obviously
came
a
long
way
as
its
a
product
of
japan
but
this
has
no
effect
on
this
type
of
infection
the
brewery
should
really
watch
their
sanitation
process
im
really
curious
what
the
beer
would
taste
like
if
it
wasnt
infected
i
will
give
this
beer
another
try
pours
a
hazy
orangereddish
hues
with
a
one
finger
cap
this
dissipated
two
a
14
inch
cap
aroma
is
slightly
sour
cherry
soda
not
like
a
lambic
just
faint
spice
of
cloves
red
table
wine
wheaty
little
citrus
and
belgian
funk
flavor
is
a
sour
wheat
with
cherry
mixed
in
spiciness
from
clove
and
coriander
has
an
old
farmhouse
ale
feel
to
it
almost
like
a
old
aged
ale
lemony
citrus
with
a
odd
aftertaste
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
medium
body
and
finishes
dry
not
quit
sure
about
all
the
flavors
yet
maybe
another
will
help
out
hand
carried
back
from
kc
mo
i
do
have
to
say
the
alcohol
isnt
as
present
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
this
still
doesnt
make
it
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
the
beer
has
a
funky
yeasty
sort
of
kick
the
beer
has
a
light
body
this
beer
is
very
thrist
quenching
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
this
is
a
special
brew
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
a
japaneese
brewery
would
describe
better
as
a
flanders
red
this
beer
starts
off
with
a
very
tart
sour
berrylike
aroma
and
flavor
decorated
with
tart
cherry
raspberry
and
ciderey
notes
the
beer
delivers
a
full
flavor
throughout
beginning
with
a
dense
eggshell
head
that
remained
creamy
the
full
flavor
shows
strong
winelike
qualities
and
low
lying
sweet
malts
the
color
is
a
hazy
cherry
or
berry
red
color
the
body
falls
a
bit
weak
from
the
souring
musky
and
earthy
with
yeasty
and
almost
moldy
the
beer
stays
crisp
and
clean
approaching
astringent
levels
it
is
very
good
and
thirst
quinching
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
in
the
finish
and
lightly
hoppy
it
could
have
a
better
sweet
malt
flavor
and
a
heftier
body
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
really
good
beer
da
low
not
really
sure
if
this
is
how
this
ale
is
supposed
to
be
im
also
having
a
hard
time
placing
it
with
belgian
strong
pale
ales
let
me
know
if
you
have
the
scoop
on
this
one
overall
is
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
i
like
the
adventuresome
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
drinkability
no
wonder
im
a
japanophile
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
toned
down
flanders
red
ale
it
was
interesting
and
fairly
enjoyable
this
was
a
really
hard
beer
to
pin
down
i
wavered
a
bit
on
the
scores
but
in
the
end
i
think
the
overall
score
comes
out
about
right
a
great
and
unique
beer
to
keep
around
r
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
offering
working
through
it
all
i
wanted
was
a
flanders
red
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
its
definitely
interesting
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
nests
for
repeat
visits
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
isnt
very
tasty
but
gets
some
points
for
being
weird
and
interesting
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
color
kind
of
a
redgold
thats
been
tinged
pink
the
head
is
a
pinktinged
white
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
cherry
lambic
in
appearance
the
nose
is
pretty
unappetizing
it
smells
of
sour
rice
and
some
asian
fruit
that
is
obscure
to
my
american
palate
but
that
ive
smelled
before
at
the
world
of
coke
exhibit
in
atlanta
believe
it
or
not
the
taste
brings
some
complexity
but
also
lots
of
sourish
red
rice
thats
a
bit
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
actually
the
carbonation
is
nicely
balanced
and
the
finish
is
good
but
overall
this
brew
reminds
me
of
some
of
those
challenging
lambics
and
sour
red
belgian
ales
i
can
appreciate
them
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
choose
to
drink
them
unless
they
were
very
carefully
paired
with
a
particular
food
clear
with
a
woody
amber
gold
color
there
is
no
lace
but
it
still
has
that
nice
floral
belgian
smell
the
taste
is
smoother
than
before
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
like
it
did
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
again
as
the
last
samplewhich
i
did
not
review
left
me
not
too
enamored
with
this
beer
it
is
a
good
un
beware
of
some
inconsistency
though
ill
not
be
getting
this
again
id
easily
get
this
again
a
heavy
pour
and
got
a
twofingered
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
hazy
golden
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
nose
is
barely
there
maybe
vanilla
starts
with
a
typical
malthop
mix
but
then
the
finish
there
is
an
incredible
kick
of
sweet
vanilla
nothing
like
i
have
had
before
and
quite
different
from
other
japanese
beers
3
89
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
went
nicely
with
the
vegetarian
tempeh
reuben
and
asian
slaw
drinkability
youre
kidding
right
seriously
is
this
even
beer
i
was
hoping
this
was
skunked
but
i
see
others
have
felt
my
pain
god
this
cant
possibily
be
the
flavor
they
were
shooting
for
can
it
if
youd
like
to
pay
4
to
drink
11
2
ounces
of
orval
with
a
mouthful
of
cocktail
olives
youve
arrived
oh
the
horror
the
horror
this
was
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
and
a
style
that
people
do
not
generally
associate
with
japanese
brewers
makes
me
want
to
have
another
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
reddish
hue
along
with
a
1
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
warm
malty
scent
that
is
dry
and
slightly
musty
i
guess
this
brew
is
made
with
red
rice
im
really
not
sure
how
to
detect
rice
aroma
it
smells
of
alcohol
and
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
flavor
that
resembles
cough
syrup
its
smooth
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
thats
warm
on
the
way
down
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
has
a
unique
flavor
a
good
flavor
could
go
well
with
japanese
cuisine
and
possibly
mediteranean
could
take
a
little
getting
used
to
i
would
love
to
attend
a
talk
on
the
cultural
importance
of
this
brew
hitachino
nest
red
rice
ale
doesnt
impress
me
i
love
kiuchis
white
ale
sweet
stout
lacto
and
this
one
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
according
to
my
three
minutes
of
google
research
red
rice
lowers
cholesterol
so
at
least
i
can
take
something
positive
away
from
this
experience
at
3
49
per
12
oz
bottle
however
lipitor
is
considerably
more
cost
effective
cant
really
say
how
this
stacks
up
against
anything
else
since
this
is
the
only
one
i
have
had
of
this
kind
seems
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
but
could
be
a
good
match
with
sushi
or
for
someone
who
really
enjoys
sake
it
does
kind
of
grow
on
you
and
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
was
thoroughly
enjoying
this
very
drinkable
with
a
unique
flavor
still
a
bit
too
expensive
to
be
included
in
my
normal
stable
of
beers
d
this
beer
is
very
soft
and
mild
i
didnt
pick
up
the
fruity
notes
as
strong
as
i
would
expect
in
this
style
for
8
12
abv
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
for
some
reason
this
beer
just
reminds
me
of
oriental
food
appropriate
considering
its
from
japan
poured
out
to
a
slighly
cloudy
amber
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
around
the
glass
smell
reminded
me
of
sweet
rice
almost
rice
pudding
flavor
was
bland
slightly
sour
and
dry
some
maltiness
noted
but
it
was
kind
of
like
spoiled
milk
finished
watery
and
slightly
grainy
a
unique
experience
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
have
again
anytime
soon
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
will
definitely
order
one
sometime
with
my
sushi
this
beer
was
very
different
from
anything
that
i
have
had
before
and
therefore
tough
to
rate
it
went
down
quickly
but
im
not
sure
if
that
was
because
it
was
highly
drinkable
or
that
it
had
my
curiousity
so
highly
piqued
its
not
bad
at
all
though
i
think
it
would
take
a
few
before
it
would
really
start
to
grow
on
me
im
confused
this
was
an
unpleasant
and
somewhat
pricey
experience
pours
a
dark
cloudy
orange
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
average
whiteish
head
that
held
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
horrid
and
i
have
nothing
i
can
compare
it
too
perhaps
a
waxy
wet
leaf
or
something
but
something
really
weird
it
was
about
as
bland
as
you
can
be
without
being
offensively
bland
and
it
was
thin
the
acidity
was
noticed
and
it
was
a
dryish
clean
finish
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
its
not
really
likable
that
smell
was
horrid
though
and
im
wondering
what
those
floaters
were
i
swallowed
color
is
a
pink
tinted
amber
with
a
moderate
amount
of
haze
head
is
ultra
white
and
a
little
below
average
in
size
but
fortunately
has
a
nice
retention
for
the
short
layer
of
foam
aroma
is
sweet
almost
sugary
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
interesting
and
for
some
reason
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
new
belgiums
biere
de
mars
a
moderate
tartness
begins
a
sip
and
is
joined
by
a
light
sweetness
the
sweetness
has
a
fruity
quality
but
of
exactly
what
fruit
i
do
not
know
the
interplay
between
the
tart
and
sweet
elements
is
interesting
tartness
seems
to
diminate
at
first
however
after
the
brew
warms
up
more
sweet
character
is
apparent
just
a
bit
of
spice
is
noted
towards
the
middle
of
the
sip
finish
is
milder
and
has
an
interesting
grainy
yet
winelike
quality
which
i
guess
is
the
rice
red
rice
is
definently
an
interesting
concoction
but
not
something
i
think
id
want
very
often
though
this
is
usually
expensive
it
is
well
worth
a
try
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
the
smell
not
bad
but
i
didnt
know
what
iwas
expecting
there
was
very
little
flavor
at
first
sweet
but
not
annoyingly
so
a
cherry
type
flavor
dominates
good
carbonation
decent
aftertaste
this
isnt
bud
rice
beer
but
it
is
still
rice
beer
while
the
flavor
grew
on
me
by
the
end
i
dont
think
i
could
have
had
too
many
more
drinkability
i
guess
if
you
like
beer
that
tastes
like
martinis
this
is
your
style
i
read
lots
of
reviews
that
said
it
tasted
like
saki
at
first
taste
i
have
never
had
saki
so
i
cant
judge
on
that
point
but
i
did
read
at
least
one
person
who
had
the
same
exact
smell
and
taste
experience
that
i
did
this
is
100
not
my
style
and
i
apologize
if
this
brings
down
the
average
the
only
positive
things
i
have
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
doesnt
look
that
bad
in
a
glass
and
at
the
very
least
its
way
better
than
crazy
eds
chili
beer
which
truthfully
means
you
can
eat
human
excrement
and
it
would
still
be
better
than
crazy
eds
so
i
guess
thats
not
saying
much
at
all
ill
remember
this
beer
for
a
long
time
but
ill
try
my
best
not
to
hold
it
against
hitachino
because
i
have
had
a
few
of
their
beers
that
have
been
just
fine
if
not
actually
dare
i
say
good
this
offering
pours
a
hazy
pale
auburnish
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
creamy
egg
white
head
the
head
holds
up
well
lots
of
carbonation
going
on
aroma
is
really
fruity
and
has
a
7grain
bread
note
going
on
theres
also
some
acidity
in
there
and
a
little
alcohol
punch
might
be
some
floral
bitterness
as
well
the
body
on
this
beer
is
really
smooth
and
creamy
almost
too
creamy
as
the
flavors
takes
a
backseat
like
it
came
from
a
nitrocan
or
something
starts
out
sweet
with
rice
notes
and
some
grainy
malts
then
it
really
dries
out
with
yeasty
flavors
a
vinegar
like
flavor
is
there
finish
is
really
dry
honestly
reminiscent
of
sake
i
could
see
how
some
people
love
this
beer
but
its
just
not
my
thang
props
for
originality
though
in
the
end
im
noncommittal
if
i
want
a
sour
beer
ill
look
to
belgium
one
small
item
of
note
though
the
bottle
is
considerably
heavier
than
most
american
12
oz
bottles
notes
i
dont
know
exactly
what
type
of
beer
this
is
but
its
definitely
not
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
was
an
odd
beer
definitely
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
a
local
micro
carrying
bar
just
got
in
ive
seen
the
bottles
of
it
in
a
local
beer
retailer
before
but
never
thought
much
of
it
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
has
a
very
clouded
honey
color
to
it
it
poured
with
almost
no
head
and
slightly
swirled
left
no
lacing
the
thought
on
my
first
taste
was
interesting
this
beer
has
a
very
unique
flavor
to
it
then
after
a
while
the
flavors
started
coming
through
it
has
a
unique
underlying
strawberry
tone
to
it
the
taste
is
almost
bitter
but
it
leaves
a
fruity
pleasant
finish
i
would
say
its
an
okay
and
interesting
to
try
brew
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
rush
out
to
get
more
though
i
would
gladly
accept
one
if
offered
one
for
free
somewhere
the
body
was
light
and
dry
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
not
because
its
bad
but
rather
i
dont
think
this
is
my
style
i
do
love
their
anniversary
ale
the
first
question
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
where
is
this
beer
when
i
go
out
to
japanese
restaurants
for
sushi
i
would
love
to
order
this
over
the
typical
macro
japanese
adjunct
beer
options
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
like
it
well
this
was
another
unique
offering
from
hitachino
this
one
is
going
to
be
an
acquired
taste
but
at
the
high
price
i
probably
wont
bother
i
like
their
classic
ale
aged
in
cedar
much
better
try
this
one
if
you
want
some
sake
and
rice
in
your
beer
a
different
brew
for
sure
and
a
bit
scoredefiant
of
that
reason
but
its
one
that
id
get
again
on
occasion
24
3
ounce
silk
screened
bottle
opened
this
one
because
i
thought
it
would
be
light
had
no
idea
it
contained
such
a
high
alcohol
level
and
that
it
would
be
sour
and
then
it
would
transform
into
something
completely
different
my
first
taste
said
to
pour
it
out
later
i
found
myself
strangely
drawn
to
the
bottle
the
beer
disembarks
the
brown
330ml
bottle
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
minimal
frothy
off
white
head
that
depletes
quickly
leaving
a
blotchy
coating
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
plum
like
fresh
and
clean
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
moderate
as
is
the
feel
at
the
top
finish
is
pleasantly
acidic
and
the
hops
forthright
in
their
spicy
presence
quite
dry
aftertaste
that
covers
the
palate
also
appears
to
be
some
alcohol
bitterness
at
the
back
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
malt
laden
beers
a
new
beer
and
brewery
to
me
its
very
rare
to
find
this
on
draft
in
southern
indiana
thank
you
roger
but
if
it
comes
around
again
i
will
order
it
again
pours
a
hazy
pale
funky
color
that
there
is
no
name
for
yellow
pink
airy
white
head
dissapears
quickly
minimal
lace
funky
aromas
of
belgian
yeasts
lemony
citrus
wheatmalt
and
slightly
sour
apple
tastes
odd
to
say
the
least
its
like
a
wheat
beer
trying
to
go
belgian
fruity
soft
and
effervescant
with
crisp
flavors
of
apple
pear
and
apricot
light
mouthfeel
dry
finish
does
not
taste
like
an
8
5
beer
at
all
i
really
dont
know
what
to
think
theres
not
another
beer
on
the
planet
that
this
reminds
me
of
worth
trying
for
the
sheer
weirdness
of
it
a
cloudy
darkish
yellow
beer
has
an
off
white
head
that
dissapears
quickly
there
is
a
very
nice
fruity
sweet
character
along
with
an
inviting
spiceyness
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
sour
dry
and
reminds
me
of
fruit
going
bad
none
of
the
belgian
spiceyness
promised
in
the
aroma
more
like
a
gueze
than
a
strong
ale
came
in
a
25oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
has
a
grainy
character
backed
by
some
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
leaves
a
bit
of
citrus
bitterness
on
the
palate
medium
drinkability
and
medium
body
this
was
an
ok
beer
nothing
too
wonderful
but
good
surprisingly
this
pours
with
a
pink
tinged
head
that
is
frothy
for
a
bit
but
then
settles
down
with
time
the
beer
has
a
hazy
light
amber
color
the
aroma
is
quite
grainy
with
some
qualities
that
i
cant
quite
pick
out
it
is
also
a
little
bit
fruity
in
the
nose
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherry
hmm
very
interesting
taste
the
finish
is
quite
unique
and
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
almost
has
a
menthol
character
to
it
maybe
a
bit
like
wet
grain
the
beer
is
light
with
a
solid
grain
character
to
it
according
to
the
label
all
of
the
color
has
come
from
the
rice
which
makes
sense
as
i
dont
taste
any
crystal
malt
notes
that
would
usually
accompany
a
beer
of
this
color
i
definitely
like
this
beer
it
is
quite
interesting
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
as
it
has
some
unique
character
to
it
managed
to
sample
this
while
i
was
in
vegas
came
in
a
bigassed
24
3
oz
dark
green
bottle
poured
out
a
clear
amber
colour
small
tight
foamy
white
head
it
had
a
very
musty
odor
to
my
nose
that
was
predominantly
what
i
could
pick
up
a
sweet
acidic
flavour
almost
sakelike
due
to
the
grains
used
to
brew
it
i
couldnt
pick
up
any
real
nuances
beyond
that
the
flavour
tends
to
turn
a
little
astringent
after
a
while
somewhat
soapy
mouthfeel
an
interesting
experiment
but
just
not
my
bag
baby
the
boys
working
the
counter
at
lees
discount
the
night
i
picked
this
up
were
right
i
should
have
grabbed
more
stone
instead
nice
white
head
sticks
to
the
glass
but
doesnt
produce
much
lacing
body
is
orange
to
golden
with
a
lot
of
sediments
original
fruity
aroma
yeasty
pears
apples
cherries
grapes
rather
sweet
but
well
made
yeasty
bread
filling
dry
and
grainy
slight
sour
spades
very
unique
and
tasty
of
course
but
not
quite
as
demarcative
as
i
hoped
nice
foamy
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
musty
finish
where
i
was
thinking
hmm
they
could
have
hidden
that
5
abv
a
tad
better
then
i
noticed
its
8
5
good
job
all
in
all
i
would
happily
buy
this
beer
again
its
as
good
inside
as
it
is
outside
the
bottle

the

anything
close

a

24
3

a
huge

aroma
sweet

medium
to
full
bodied
with

very

its
hard
to
believe
this
is
8
5
this
ale
pours
a
weird
orange
brown
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
light
malt
accents
the
flavor
is
absoultly
mind
boggling
in
nevada
there
is
a
native
plant
called
indian
tea
or
mormon
tea
which
is
an
ephedra
relative
i
have
drank
this
tea
many
times
and
red
rice
has
a
flavor
very
much
like
the
indian
tea
in
that
it
has
a
creamy
medicinal
quality
reminds
me
of
sake
this
ale
has
a
flavor
that
is
strange
and
enticing
at
the
same
time
the
finish
has
a
medicinal
graininess
to
it
that
i
can
only
equate
to
red
rice
an
excellent
ale
to
experience
as
it
showcases
the
prowress
of
japanese
brewers
hitachino
nests
red
rice
ale
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
available
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
gold
body
that
streams
with
effervescent
carbonation
beneath
a
34
cap
of
fluffy
brightwhite
foam
the
head
retention
is
very
good
and
it
leaves
some
nice
spots
and
thins
splashes
of
transient
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
quite
unusual
with
an
aroma
that
expresses
wheat
but
is
also
similar
to
that
of
a
dry
white
wine
combined
with
a
touch
of
playdoh
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
very
delicate
effervescent
carbonation
that
lends
a
mild
zest
to
the
tongue
before
it
warms
in
the
mouth
becoming
airy
and
slightly
creamy
theres
an
odd
almost
medicinal
lightly
tart
and
slightly
candyish
note
in
the
flavor
thats
quite
unique
its
kind
of
like
delicate
spice
wrapped
in
soft
creamy
candy
all
tied
together
with
a
twine
of
dried
flowers
it
finishes
with
its
sweetness
rapidly
fading
as
its
tartness
and
bitterness
rise
and
a
mild
bitterness
spicy
hop
light
phenolic
and
some
astringency
linger
in
the
mouth
as
odd
as
it
is
its
also
quite
delicate
and
in
that
way
it
becomes
quite
enticing
there
are
some
harsh
notes
to
it
but
there
are
also
harsh
notes
in
the
best
belgian
gueuze
theyre
what
gives
it
its
character
and
this
beer
is
nowhere
near
as
intense
as
a
gueuze
you
may
not
love
it
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
i
find
it
intriguing
and
perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
in
the
world
my
highest
praise
to
mr
toshiyuki
kiuchi
overall
i
am
not
one
for
style
infractions
having
stoned
the
style
police
van
when
it
drives
anywhere
near
me
but
i
have
to
say
that
the
belgium
strong
pale
ale
description
may
be
a
tad
misleading
to
those
who
have
not
tried
this
before
think
more
of
light
pale
ale
with
hints
of
citric
acidity
and
zesty
red
berry
fruits
mixed
with
some
saki
soaked
malts
whatever
you
want
to
refer
to
is
as
its
my
third
brew
now
from
kiuchi
and
this
is
just
as
damn
tasty
and
impressive
as
the
other
two
expensive
but
recommended
this
one
takes
some
getting
used
to
it
is
kind
of
an
odd
looking
and
tasting
beer
it
pours
a
light
amber
with
some
evident
reddish
hues
it
had
a
shortlasting
head
and
only
minor
lacing
the
aroma
is
primarily
ricey
with
some
spices
underneath
the
taste
is
very
complex
it
is
sweetish
throughout
with
some
vanilla
and
coriander
tastes
near
the
end
it
is
sweet
than
a
sweet
malt
the
beer
is
effervescent
cleansing
and
light
the
beer
is
a
on
the
sweet
side
to
drink
more
than
one
but
it
was
a
very
interesting
tasting
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
once
was
enough
for
me
worth
trying
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
a
sweet
and
sour
dish
still
not
great
but
quite
an
interesting
approach
smooth
yet
still
spicy
and
lively
but
very
drinkable
quite
a
quencher
with
a
kick
taste
was
oddly
sweet
and
slick
to
start
syrupy
almost
hints
of
fruits
strawberries
raspberries
and
lots
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
certain
crispness
toward
the
finish
that
attribute
to
the
rice
no
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
budweiser
but
not
what
i
expected
either
seems
to
me
more
sweet
than
anything
almost
one
the
way
to
being
a
tripel
medium
to
light
bodied
noticable
alcohol
kick
and
flavors
not
a
guzzler
to
be
sure
but
an
interesting
beer
probably
wont
go
searching
it
out
again
for
a
while
truly
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
i
applaud
the
brewers
for
their
inventiveness
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
light
head
that
leaves
some
light
lacingaroma
is
of
grain
alcohol
and
some
green
apple
i
have
had
saki
only
a
few
times
but
i
pick
up
a
big
saki
flavor
to
this
brew
in
the
finish
along
with
a
light
smokiness
and
like
a
few
others
a
light
olive
juice
flavor
as
well
a
real
odd
and
perplexing
beer
but
it
kinda
grown
on
ya
after
a
few
drinksglad
i
gave
it
a
try
source
liquid
solutions
good
drinkability
very
clean
not
hugely
complicated
but
nothing
i
could
pick
out
as
being
wrong
nice
to
see
rice
used
for
once
in
a
good
way
its
here
to
improve
the
beer
and
make
it
unique
this
was
an
interesting
brew
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
orange
with
a
pinkish
hue
in
the
foam
the
combination
of
prune
juice
and
seltzer
water
came
to
mind
the
foam
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
definitely
has
a
rice
or
bean
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
with
effervescent
carbonation
rice
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
plus
some
sour
notes
that
finished
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
i
have
enjoyed
some
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
but
i
dont
believe
i
will
be
trying
this
one
again
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
hard
to
decide
it
is
different
it
is
a
must
drink
just
because
of
how
different
this
stuff
is
big
tamarind
character
on
this
one
maybe
with
some
saffron
unique
and
very
evident
of
wild
rice
but
offputting
and
offensive
on
its
own
as
one
who
loves
sake
i
can
see
where
hitachino
is
coming
from
with
this
and
i
think
theyve
made
something
remarkably
complex
paired
with
sushi
or
any
peanuty
thai
dish
this
could
be
very
special
not
a
good
beer
i
have
no
problem
with
a
tart
beer
even
a
sour
beer
when
that
is
appropriate
but
here
my
impression
was
a
wheat
beer
with
a
good
measure
of
green
olive
juice
tossed
in
the
beer
had
an
odd
acidic
backdrop
to
the
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
something
cured
in
brine
i
like
a
dirty
martini
with
a
bit
of
olive
juice
but
the
flavor
turning
up
in
beer
was
not
pleasant
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
grow
on
me
and
i
gave
the
beer
every
chance
but
in
the
end
it
was
a
sink
dump
perhaps
this
is
one
of
those
loveitorhateit
beers
i
fall
in
the
latter
category
this
is
one
odd
and
very
unique
drinkin
a
deliciously
good
way
as
the
finish
from
my
last
sip
lingers
on
and
on
an
on
i
have
to
ruminate
rather
deeply
about
what
to
say
here
the
color
is
much
that
of
a
framboisehazy
blonde
ale
color
yet
with
a
raspberry
tinge
the
head
is
sushi
rice
color
and
sticks
to
the
glass
rather
well
the
aromatics
are
lovely
clean
and
fresh
with
the
delicate
fruitines
one
finds
in
fine
sake
the
rice
gives
off
an
almost
tapioca
like
odor
with
some
vanilla
melon
faint
strawberry
and
definate
sake
flavors
the
alcohol
is
at
once
warming
yet
the
beer
is
wonderfully
refreshing
at
the
same
time
again
like
the
white
ale
this
beer
screams
out
for
food
and
im
talking
japanese
food
the
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
the
flavors
redolent
of
sushi
i
can
taste
clean
rice
flavors
and
even
a
meatyfishy
flavor
almost
tuna
like
this
is
really
fun
to
drink
and
im
now
planning
my
meal
to
accompany
this
fine
beverage
bravo
medium
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
kind
of
champagne
like
its
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
sake
somewhat
sweet
somewhat
sour
there
is
a
subtle
hoppyness
that
builds
on
the
palate
light
a
refreshing
carbonation
is
also
champagne
like
lots
of
small
quickly
disappearing
bubbles
interesting
beer
has
a
definite
ricelike
taste
to
it
but
in
a
good
way
not
at
all
like
bud
etc
interesting
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
hides
the
7
alcohol
well
i
like
it
when
brewers
take
chances
with
their
beers
very
different
and
worth
trying
another
unusual
offering
from
kiuchi
honeyamber
colored
with
a
fast
dissipating
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
reminiscent
of
cooked
rice
and
white
bread
the
body
is
light
and
clean
tasting
a
mild
hop
taste
mingles
with
a
slight
astringent
fuminess
a
seltzery
effervescence
remains
throughout
the
glass
how
do
they
do
it
the
8
5
abv
is
not
noticeable
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
gold
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
white
head
that
left
some
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
some
floral
aspects
a
flavor
of
citrus
rice
and
some
grain
elements
the
finish
was
sprite
and
somewhat
sudsy
i
really
can
place
this
beer
style
wise
so
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
good
feelopinion
for
this
beer
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
light
straw
color
with
tall
fluffy
persistent
foam
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
initially
reminscent
of
sake
with
hints
of
lactic
acid
and
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hops
and
some
grapes
the
initial
flavor
was
very
tart
almost
sour
but
after
a
few
drinks
i
became
accustomed
to
it
and
it
reminded
me
of
a
sour
lambic
in
that
regard
over
flavors
detected
a
vinous
taste
slightly
musty
floral
hops
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
initially
tart
with
a
good
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
body
was
mediumlight
with
modest
carbonation
feel
surprisingly
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
this
ale
was
8

abv
this
ale
was
quite
drinkable
and
really
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
an
interesting
and
unusual
ale
from
japan
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
ale
intriguing
little
beer
that
packs
lots
of
flavors
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
alcohol
8

not
an
everyday
brew
for
me
but
one
i
would
buy
again
just
for
its
difference
transparent
peach
color
with
extremely
active
head
surprised
at
the
lacing
despite
the
soda
like
carbonation
there
is
very
little
aroma
the
flavor
is
neither
hoppy
malty
nor
ricey
i
do
not
get
the
hype
i
do
not
think
this
is
more
than
a
gimmicky
budweiser
bud
use
a
lot
of
rice
has
an
odd
body
odor
flavor
highly
carbonated
lame
i
would
not
bother
trying
this
again
f
the
second
time
around
it
had
a
bittersour
finish
on
the
tongue
and
palate
it
poured
a
deep
orange
yellow
with
no
difference
in
the
foam
as
the
first
time
i
have
down
graded
this
beer
by
one
point
all
around
what
a
funky
little
brew
hazy
goldenbeige
with
a
fluffy
white
head
as
others
have
noted
the
carbonation
ensures
that
a
nice
sticky
lace
stays
around
for
the
duration
what
an
odd
aroma
wild
rice
a
touch
of
tart
fruitiness
strawberry
kiwi
more
rice
enveloping
the
aroma
also
something
else
in
there
green
olives
which
is
strange
and
yet
intriguing
everything
about
the
taste
is
subtle
yet
also
intriguing
first
theres
a
mild
malt
undertone
that
holds
up
the
brew
with
starchy
wildrice
flavors
creamy
some
medicinal
flavors
intoxicating
alcohol
seems
hardly
there
which
is
ninjadangerous
except
for
the
slight
peppery
finish
where
i
also
noticed
the
closest
resemblance
to
sake
this
would
have
been
perfect
with
my
dinner
tonight
takeout
from
the
local
japanese
steakhouse
and
oh
yeah
the
owl
is
very
cool
retasted

no
change
in
scores
its
like
a
cross
between
a
hefeweizen
and
a
sparkling
vouvray
or
prosecco
this
is
one
of
those
off
the
wall
yet
extremely
interesting
brews
not
something
id
buy
all
the
time
but
for
more
of
a
treat
or
a
conversational
brew
paired
well
with
my
tuna
sushi
roll
note
be
respectful
of
this
beer
itll
kick
your
ass
with
its
unique
type
of
alcohol
and
its
content
decent
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
worth
trying
for
the
intense
herb
lovers
very
spicy
when
cold
but
improved
a
lot
as
it
warmed
up
happy
new

let
it

is

what

no

good

not

nice

no

one
might

not
here
so
whats
left
meh
d
a
decent
brew
quite
bitter
which
takes
this
down
a
notch
in
my
book
clashes
too
much
with
the
style
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style

with

offers
apricot

some

notes
and
a
big
bitter
finish
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
bottleconditioned
so
big
carbonation
d
i
will
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
this
isnt
the
most
christmasy
beer
at
least
in
the
traditional
sense
of
dark
spiced
and
generally
heavy
ales
nevertheless
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
given
that
i
love
belgian
pales
ill
pick
one
up
around
the
holidays
whenever
i
have
the
opportunity
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
taste
both
2010
and
2013
vintages
side
by
side
at
the
bull
and
bush
holiday
event
last
night
and
my
take
on
this
beer
is
that
time
does
not
flatter
it
at
all
it
pours
a
dark
honey
color
with
rusty
orange
hues
and
a
robust
whitish
head
with
excellent
retention
the
nose
is
strange
juicy
rotting
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
an
odd
combination
it
smells
like
compost
when
its
half
ready
less
earthy
but
equally
sort
of
sweet
and
vinegary
not
fully
appetizing
the
flavor
is
fresher
but
still
with
a
juicy
fruity
element
that
doesnt
really
fit
what
i
thought
knew
about
holiday
beer
not
overly
spiced
but
some
herbal
flavors
hit
as
does
some
bitter
citrus
in
the
finish
belgian
yeast
seems
out
of
place
for
the
flavor
profile
too
this
is
all
over
the
place
the
2013
vintage
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
bubbly
and
cleaner
than
the
messy
taste
but
the
2010
had
lost
its
vigorous
carbonation
and
came
across
particularly
thin
as
a
result
i
didnt
really
care
for
either
one
as
they
lacked
that
winter
warming
property
that
i
love
about
holiday
beer
i
would
pass
this
up
if
i
encounter
is
again
rjt
strong
flavors
in
every
area
hops
spice
farm
sweetness
make
this
seem
a
little
all
over
the
place
but
its
good
overall
complex
and
somewhat
intense
flavors
for
7
classy
packaging
typical
of
de
ranke
light
amber
mostly
clear
with
a
thick
clumpy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
tulip
just
a
nice
spicy
belgian
ale
big
black
and
white
pepper
notes
along
with
a
wallop
of
grassy
hops
a
hint
of
liquorice
adds
some
intrigue
but
isnt
obvious
or
overwhelming
very
dry
and
digestible
a
snappy
almost
chalky
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
finish
this
doesnt
scream
of
the
holiday
season
but
certainly
screams
of
a
quality
enjoyable
belgian
ale
de

i
wish
we

more

swaths

around
the

the

down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
spice
and
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
isnt
too
good
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
slightly
foamy
smooth
never
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
blends
unobtrusively
with
the
flavors
closes
quite
dry
with
modest
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
orange
golden
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
retreats
the
beer
smells
of
barley
malt
with
some
nice
fruity
notes
i
get
lemon
and
banana
as
well
as
some
clove
and
pepper
spiciness
im
also
picking
up
some
grassiness
as
well
the
grassy
hop
notes
provide
a
nice
flavor
for
this
beer
as
well
as
back
end
bitterness
i
get
the
spice
from
the
nose
but
more
of
those
pepper
notes
than
the
clove
notes
but
the
clove
notes
do
come
out
more
in
later
sips
i
also
get
plenty
of
that
bready
malt
after
the
first
sip
i
dont
notice
the
7
abv
at
all
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
theres
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
hops
from
this
beer
while
the
alcohol
isnt
present
in
the
flavor
it
brings
a
nice
warming
feel
after
a
few
sips
this
is
a
very
good
beer
d
i
dont
know
about
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
seems
all
mixed
up
overall
not
a
bad
brew
not
sure
if
its
christmas
worthy
worth
trying
but
not
keeping
hope
you
have
enjoyed
better
than
me
salud
jd
the
mixed
up
flavor
profile
really
set
this
back
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
good
balance
i
recommend
trying
it
out
altogether
lacking
in
complexity
and
it
at
best
shows
moderate
depth
the
little
dextriny
roll
on
the
tongue
and
dry
snap
is
something
to
be
positive
about
nothing
to
recommend
here
o
it
is
definitely
a
quality
bpa
where
both
the
belgian
yeastiness
and
pale
ale
hoppiness
are
married
well
however
nothing
really
speaks
to
this
beer
related
to
santa
or
the
hoiday
seasons
in
any
way
other
than
the
label
which
is
a
little
disappointing
de
ranke
get
it
right
again
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
winter
ale
its
perfect
for
a
snowy

if
id
pay
13

for
this
again
with
that
being
said
i
think
its
worth
trying
overall
this
is
not
too
bad
for
a
belgian
but
i
dont
find
much
unique
about
this
or
distinct
for
a
seasonal
beer
one
of
the
better
bspas
that
i
have
yet
encountered
but
also
one
that
has
little
to
do
with
anything
remotely
christmaslike
ok
maybe
i
grind
pepper
onto
my
potatoes
and
turkey
but
that
isnt
quite
the
idea
here
a
good
tipple
just
maybe
not
one
to
that
directly
complements
all
those
endemic
holiday
baked
goods
pere
noel
pours
a
hazy
dark
tangerine
color
two
fingers
of
lightly
whipped
foam
rise
up
atop
the
beer
but
neither
head
retention
nor
lacing
do
anything
to
distinguish
themselves
the
nose
is
wonderfully
complex
aromas
of
straw
crackers
light
peachy
stone
fruit
and
a
bit
of
pepper
all
show
up
with
any
one
of
the
above
seeming
to
be
dominant
each
time
i
take
it
in
the
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
vibrancy
that
was
found
in
the
nose
theres
a
good
amount
of
cracker
malt
sweetness
up
front
and
a
fair
bit
of
freshly
cracked
black
pepper
in
the
finish
unfortunately
theres
not
much
else
whats
present
is
nice
i
just
found
myself
wanting
a
little
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
the
body
is
a
touch
chewy
and
the
carbonation
is
decidedly
muted
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
aside
from
the
aromatics
de
rankes
pere

fairly
hohum
bspa
oim
usually
hesitant
to
purchase
belgians
i
havent
heard
of
sometimes
im
met
with
a
great
surprise
but
there
are
times
when
the
beer
scares
me
they
scare
me
because
i
think
about
how
this
bottle
has
possibly
been
on
the
shelf
forever
since
most
people
will
just
walk
past
something
in
a
bland
label
that
theyve
never
heard
of
this
bottle
though
clearly
states
it
is
drinkable
until
mid
2013
so
im
left
to
believe
this
is
just
truly
a
terrible
beer
that
ill
never
give
another
chance
tastes
like
a
science
experiment
a
bad
science
experiment
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
thats
very
easy
to
drink
without
a
hint
of
booze
at
any
point
at
all
i
didnt
know
it
when
i
grabbed
this
from
the
fridge
but
its
just
what
i
was
craving
on
this
snowy
chilly
day

quite
smooth
to

on
a
fairly
enjoyable
offering
overall
average
and
good
bspa
enjoyable
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
go
to
first
overall
an
interesting
tasting
beer
cant
say
ive
had
one
quite
like
it
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
that
lingers
after
there
beers
gone
down
not
really
a
christmasy
beer
but
still
quite
good
not
something
id
pick
up
again
however
o
decent
but
not
too
spectacular
o
an
interesting
spicy
brew
its
pretty
drinkable
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
pours
a
cloudy

dark

spicing
mild
flavor
of

malt
and
fruit
immediate
hop
kick
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
nonspecific
hop
bitterness
kind
of
low
key
for
flavor
and
the
hops
are
nice
but
not
very
aromatic
a
pleasant
but
not
that
memorable
belgian
hopped
ale
this
one
lacks
the
special
qualities
one
normally
seeks
in
a
holiday
beer
however
it
is
satisfying
on
a
rainy
spring
day
o
this
a
really
hoppy
belgian
ale
it
almost
tasted
like
a
belgian
ipa
different
and
interesting
not
you
usual
belgian
christmas
beer
thats
for
sure
overall
i
like
this
very
much
12
50
for
a
large
bottle
is
a
little
prohibitive
but
its
a
lovely
splurge
as
well
done
as
any
fine
belgian
ale
that
country
truly
has
a
lock
on
fine
beer
good
zesty
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
decent
beer
but
a
bit
hard
to
drink
a
whole
one
unless
you
get
a
330ml
bottle
somewhat
disappointing
in
that
its
not
like
other
holiday
offerings
the
taste
is
run
of
the
mill
bpa
with
only
moderate
abv
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
disappointing

from

its

some

has

overall
a

is
strong

taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
black
pepper
some
nutmeg
and
plenty
of
dark
greens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoothish
feel
overall
a
generally
nice
beer
but
one
that
doesnt
really
impress
in
any
meaningful
way
its
tasty
and
solid
but
nothing
special
taste
was
big
as
well
packed
a
lot
of
hoppiness
in
there
with
lots
of
the
yeast
phenols
very
dry
slightly
bready
every
sip
was
big
time
there
wasnt
much
in
the
way
of
nuance
the
yeast
flavor
didnt
impart
any
banana
or
fruityness
cant
really
tell
what
makes
this
a
xmas
beer
its
pretty
much
just
hops
and
standard
belgian
yeast
its
enjoyable
and
all
its
just
kinda
puzzling
why
they
put
santa
on
the
label
but
then
again
theres
nothing
xmasy
about
lagunitas
sucks
o
good
stuff
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
but
in
a
good
way
merry
christmas
o
this
ale
had
a
great
head
and
lacing
but
the
nose
was
a
bit
off
to
me
and
i
thought
the
bitterness
was
a
bit
overpowering
i
liked
the
grand
cru
winter
reserve
slightly
better
in
the
taste
there
is
the
same
caramel
touch
not
much
though
taste
is
a
bit
too
thin
and
i
worder
why
this
is
called
a
christmas
beer
o
i
love
belgian
beers
and
enjoy
the
christmas
seasonals
this
was
a
good
blend
of
both
o
overall
gets
the
job
done
as
far
as
belgian
xmas
goes
nothing
too
robust
again
pretty
sure
something
was
wrong
with
this
pour
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
be
beer
was
pretty
nice
it
doesnt
have
any
aromas
of
a
christmas
beer
i
was
really
surprised
by
that
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
fresh
sweet
grains
in
there
along
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
had
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
ever
say
that
this
is
a
christmas
brew
though
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
at
the
same
time
not
extremely
intriguing
either
a
solid
belgian
strong
ale
from
the
folks
at
brouwerj
de
ranke
o
the
nice
brett
character
is
a
bit
clean
and
the
fizz
hides
some
of
the
character
but
the
grapefruit
flavor
really
grows
as
the
beer
warms
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
mediumbodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
easydrinking
if
a
little
underwhelming
the
name
implies
a
holiday
ale
of
some
kind
but
it
isnt
really
its
a
strong
yet
smooth
ale
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
pleasantly
hoppy
and
somewhat
yeasty
in
the
nose
and
to
the
tongue
with
just
a
tinge
of
spice
smoother
than
a
witbier
not
to
heavy
or
bloating
nice
allaround
selection
very
good
ale
would
definitely
like
to
try
it
fresher
as
i
just
purchased
on
the
closeout
rack
at
the
local
total
wine
more
i
finished
this
and
it
was
worth
the
2
and
decent
not
sure
how
fresh
unfresh
this
was
so
a
bit
annoyed
at
that
but
still
de
ranke
makes
great
beers
this
is
maybe
the
weakest
offering
from
them
ive
tried
would
try
again
but
nearer
to
the
source
a
very
murky
cloud
of
amber
brown
colored
brew
with
a
modest
white
cover
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
polite
but
definitive
evergreen
yeast
and
subtle
citrus
hop
and
some
mild
cinnamon
nutmeg
nice
the
flavor
makes
a
mark
with
lots
more
yeasty
lemon
hop
with
a
clove
hint
on
the
tongue
its
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
lively
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
it
seems
pretty
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
this
belgian
ipa
idea
this
is
a
bit
grassy
which
detracts
for
me
but
its
a
nice
blend
with
some
subtle
ideas
floating
around
including
some
banana
and
corriander
but
its
mostly
a
polite
but
edgey
belgian
hop
brew
and
i
have
no
idea
why
this
is
billed
as
a
christmas
brew
no
complaints
though
worth
a
try
though
maybe
not
the
price
this
bomber
typically
goes
for
o
well
balanced
interesting
not
too
heavy
and
impressivey
hoppy
for
a
belgian
de
ranke
has
my
respect
drinkability
very
interesting
good
beer
complex
and
interesting
great
holiday
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
creamy
dense
head
that
reaches
several
fingers
high
lots
and
lots
of
lacing
though
not
necessarily
the
best
retention
the
nose
is
pretty
plain
with
some
mild
spicingmaybe
a
sprucelike
character
the
taste
is
a
bit
astringent
and
harsh
really
there
is
an
odd
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
really
dry
finish
this
is
pretty
odd
overall
and
im
not
quite
sure
what
they
were
going
for
tastes
like
a
fabulous
combination
between
an
american
and
belgian
pa
you
got
the
fruity
barley
of
a
belgian
starting
things
off
moving
into
a
rusty
earthy
middle
then
into
dry
and
citrusy
hops
and
then
a
finish
that
smacks
of
coriander
white
pepper
and
grass
d
engaging
drinking
i
surely
want
it
another
but
at
a
good
level
of
maturation
cant
say
ive
ever
tasted
anything
like
this
very
different
belgian
flavors
mixed
together
but
with
plenty
of
hops
interesting
brew
d
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
makes
this
beer
relatively
easy
to
drink
it
smelled
strong
of
citrusy
hops
the
beer
was
light
and
smooth
to
the
taste
you
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
good
holiday
brew
750ml
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
2014
so
this
must
be
a
2009
darn
no
wonder
it
was
discounted
hazy
orange
color
and
smells
like
citrus
and
spices
just
ok
though
the
taste
is
more
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
this
is
good
as
far
as
the
style
is
concerned
but
it
still
wasnt
worth
the
10
i
spent
on
it
d
high
drinkability
not
to
heavy
and
with
the
7
not
noticeable
one
wouldnt
have
to
much
of
a
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
ontap
at
tap
and
table
got
a
very
full
tulip
glass
for
8
with
very
little
head
the
beer
was
tasty
enough
however
that
i
was
happy
to
have
the
headspace
filled
the
was
a
spicy
almost
herbal
cherry
aroma
probably
from
the
licorice
and
flavor
with
a
little
apricot
and
pear
before
a
peppery
borderline
grassy
finish
it
was
fairly
drinkable
for
the
strength
but
it
was
also
complex
enough
to
leave
me
satisfied
to
slowly
sip
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgians
ive
had
lately
and
completely
worth
checking
out
the
character
is
like
that
of
a
cleaned
up
farmhouse
ale
not
a
standard
spicedup
christmas
beer
the
beer
was
cloudy
amberorange
not
a
good
look
but
the
beer
tasted
exquisite
spicy
with
citric
hops
and
a
great
long
bittersweet
finish
yum
had
this
one
last
night
at
a
christmas
party
and
enjoyed
it
poured
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
citrus
and
spices
light
to
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
drinkable
with
a
light
sweetness
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
mild
bit
of
tartness
d
a
decent
belgian
pale
possibly
regarded
as
a
winter
brew
because
of
the
abv
elevation
clocking
in
at
7
and
the
darker
fruity
sweeter
flavors
generated
as
opposed
to
other
belgian
pales
no
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
one
of
those
really
delicious
and
complex
beers
that
i
simply
cant
score
highly
in
the
bspa
category
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
of
noble
hops
and
light
maltbread
exceptional
taste
noble
hops
up
front
followed
by
malt
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
delicious
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
give
me
more
poured
from
a
75
cl
into
a
tulip
glass
big
head
with
a
deep
golden
hazy
hue
mild
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
an
old
farmhouse
grassy
and
earthy
the
flavor
is
a
drying
bitter
bite
all
the
way
through
to
finish
there
is
touch
of
spicy
hops
but
the
drying
effect
is
dominant
the
body
is
full
for
7
and
i
find
myself
thinking
that
this
is
a
great
hopped
ale
from
beligum
overall
the
beer
has
the
same
progression
and
intensity
as
achouffe
houblon
dobblet
ipa
but
with
slightly
different
flavors
throughout
still
this
beer
is
on
par
with
the
better
hoppy
belgian
ales
from
that
region
pours
a
dark
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
though
it
decreased
a
bit
remained
until
the
final
sip
i
would
almost
prefer
to
smell
the
beer
than
drink
it
a
brilliant
aroma
of
hops
fruit
and
something
that
i
could
not
trace
and
will
bother
me
for
a
while
that
something
maybe
sugarcane
really
stands
out
the
taste
primarily
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
too
grassy
for
my
liking
drinkabilityoverall
lemony
and
slightly
funkyspicy
belgian
ipa
tasty
dont
particularly
want
another
glass
of
it
though
i
could
see
it
going
very
well
with
something
in
the
middle
of
a
meal
maybe
steamed
muscles
a
heavy
salad
or
some
well
spiced
chicken
nathan

a
magnum
of

vintage

night

a

amber
with
a

with

and

the

fresh

mildly
hoppy
mildly
musty
with

i

this
is
13

with

overall
good
but
unbalanced
without
the
mild
belgian
funk
youd
think
this
was
an
american
ipa
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
this
but
it
isnt
special
enough
for
me
to
seek
again
a
one
trick
pony
good
beer
not
sure
about
an
xmas
brew
though
would
do
well
in
the
summertime
dnice
beer
the
sweetness
starts
to
take
over
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
carbonation
blows
off
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
moderate
strength
the
7
doesnt
make
itself
known
pretty
delicious
feel
and
drinkability
medium
body
with
what
seems
like
it
used
to
be
higher
levels
of
carbonation
i
think
theyve
dropped
over
the
years
carbonation
is
very
very
fine
tiny
bubbles
that
dont
attack
the
tongue
but
add
to
the
beers
feel
and
flavor
all
in
all
ill
most
likely
finish
the
bottle
wouldnt
want
to
have
paid
for
this
bottle
being
the
way
it
is
now
still
aged
its
something
that
i
can
drink
im
positive
that
its
better
without
any
age
on
it
d
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
the
pere
noel
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
very
nice
1
finger
head
and
some
lacing
along
the
glass
the
pour
is
very
pretty
smells
of
citrus
spices
and
hops
quaff
surprised
me
a
bit
there
is
a
distinct
red
wine
dryness
to
the
taste
a
little
alcohol
is
noted
as
well
as
a
base
of
malts
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
slick
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
a
good
belgian
ale
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
holiday
ale
good
work
de
ranke
drinkability
highly
overall
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
but
mostly
not
that
good
aroma
is
the
best
part
but
everything
else
is
average
or
just
a
bit
above
so
interesting
but
disappointing
a
nice
belgain
winter
ale
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
the
malty
flavours
hit
the
palate
initially
then
ends
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
light
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
not
a
heavy
winter
ale
like
most
winter
ales
suggest
this
for
a
change
to
a
light
winter
ale
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
clean
the
feel
is
smooth
though
i
give
it
that
very
easy
going
down
with
the
feel
of
light
but
rightly
proportioned
carb
there
is
some
spicy
alcohol
throughout
this
though
that
somewhat
kills
it
for
me
id
say
this
is
close
to
being
on
the
medium
side
i
would
not
get
this
again
if
i
wanted
a
bspa
i
would
of
ordered
a
fucking
duvel
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
dryness
towards
the
end
d
not
my
favorite
style
of
christmas
beer
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
d
definitely
a
top
christmas
beer
unusual
for
its
hoppiness
and
lack
of
sweetness
d
im
going
to
give
this
one
a
pass
since
breweries
are
pretty
much
allowed
to
do
what
they
want
with
the
christmas
style
of
beer
but
there
is
nothing
christmas
about
it
just
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
overall
a
nice
belgian
pale
with
a
pretty
pronounced
hop
profile
a
nice
beer
this
was
a
nice
brew
that
for
me
served
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
flavor
of
the
american
pale
ales
and
india
pale
ales
im
used
to
good
atmosphere
appearance
is
pretty
representative
great
nose
combination
of
a
lot
of
components
very
pleasing
well
done
flavor
is
more
basic
but
very
full
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
m
a
little
thin
almost
no
carbonation
this
beer
seems
like
it
was
a
good
idea
gone
bad
poured
with
a
slight
head
and
a
tiny
bit
a
lace
color
isnt
copper
but
a
slightly
hazy
light
to
medium
amber
aroma
is
spicy
malty
a
hint
of
hop
yeasty
caramel
nougat
toffee
marshmallows
and
toast
flavor
is
similar
add
pretzels
heavier
on
the
yeast
bitterness
and
a
tang
that
i
cant
identify
great
carbonation
and
good
body
finish
is
fairly
long
and
bitter
not
bad
very
slightly
boozy
not
a
quaffing
beer
but
not
really
a
sipper
either
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
slightly
malty
and
just
a
little
bit
sweet
flavor
is
sharp
fruity
somewhat
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
and
slightly
sweet
texture
is
lively
and
tingly
so
it
seems
to
dance
on
the
tongue
and
down
the
pipes
overall
this
was
a
unique
beer
and
was
surprisingly
bitter
however
i
didnt
find
it
completely
out
of
place
worth
a
shot

think
maybe

it
was
also
very
thin

my

i
seriously

it

at

per

probably
never
find
out
if
you
run
across

try
that

of

a
cloudy
dark
copper

is
fantastic
grassy

grainy
with
some
citrus

other
light

as
well
as
a
bit

the
taste
is
equally
nice
with

of

where
met
with
a
change
of
pace
brew
very
good
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
md
refreshing
on
the
carbonation
mediumbodied
reasonably
yeasty
and
marvellous
hoppy
against
a
balanced
performance
bw
yeastiness
and
sourfruity
touch
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
bit
less
pleasant
than
the
sister
product
xx
bitter
which
is
always
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
ales
although
i
fail
to
find
this
ale
in
line
with
the
idea
behind
any
other
belgian
xmas
ale
that
tends
to
be
highly
malty
spicy
fruity
estery
or
heaveyweight
i
personally
think
this
is
a
lovely
tasty
brew
that
should
be
enjoyed
all
year
round
on
any
occasion
including
the
special
season
of
xmas
of
course
notes
this
is
a
solid
bspa
this
beer
is
very
strong
in
flavor
and
was
hard
to
ignore
it
has
spice
and
allot
hops
with
a
very
bitter
clean
and
dry
finish
if
you
are
a
hop
head
and
a
big
belgian
fan
this
one
might
be
for
you
the
mouth
fell
was
a
little
lacking
but
the
smell
and
appearance
with
its
massive
head
certainly
made
up
for
it
a
very
tart
and
dry
beer
with
light
spice
and
a
bit
of
brett
almost
within
saison
territory
but
hoppier
drinkability
not
as
sweet
as
id
have
my
christmas
beers
but
pretty
good
stuff
all
in
all
overall
just
ok
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
worth
the
try
pours
an
opaque
and
cloudy
orange
brown
color
with
small
froth
puffs
of
foam
on
its
surface
leaving
some
sticking
fresh
oily
and
citrusy
hops
right
up
front
in
the
nose
slightly
resinous
and
piney
with
a
subdued
grapefruit
aroma
that
reminds
of
a
west
coast
ipa
this
is
to
go
without
mentioning
the
slightly
herbal
medicinal
classic
belgian
hop
character
dancing
beside
bright
in
flavor
big
fruity
juicy
hops
and
a
bready
belgian
yeast
character
grainy
and
obviously
unfiltered
to
the
tongue
it
makes
the
beers
body
and
overall
flavor
profile
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fresh
but
bitter
finish
this
beer
will
remain
one
of
my
favorites
for
years
to
come

it

have

this

full

with
limited

great
carbonation
and
no

interesting
experience
but
maybe
a
tad
too
dry
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
repetitive
basis
overall
i
was
rather
disappointed
by
this
one
it
was
just
too
bland
for
me
and
really
never
did
get
off
the
ground
it
is
not
really
terrible
in
any
way
its
just
not
really
exciting
either
i
wished
there
could
have
been
a
little
more
depth
to
it
some
more
complexity
its
not
a
bad
call
but
for
the
price
i
would
look
elsewhere
despite
the
nice
look
and
pretty
good
nose
the
taste
just
isnt
balanced
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
maybe
not
but
its
not
one
im
itching
to
try
again

like
for

here
maybe
this
should
be
an
easter
beer
d
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
was
a
hot
spicy
and
hoppy
belgian
that
really
warmed
the
soul
and
drank
much
bigger
then
its
advertised

of
the

with
ripe

and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
ending
with
a
little
clove
and
a
metalic
aftertaste
got
this
in
the
shelton
bros
xmas
bundle
it
is
a
nice
bitter
ale
i
think
it
is
a
little
darker
and
just
a
little
fruitier
and
a
bit
more
complex
than
de
rankes
xx
bitter
but
i
dont
see
what
is
so
xmasy
about
this
one
it
would
be
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
evening
good
choice
for
an
xmas
in
july
party
if
you
save
it
until
then
from

good
a
750ml
bottle
with
best
by
92012
on
the
label
poured
into
a
tulip
glas
it
was
an
orange
color
nicely
carbonated
a
fairly
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipated
it
had
a
sweet
honeylike
aroma
with
a
bit
of
clove
spiciness
initially
sweet
to
the
taste
with
a
fairly
big
hops
presence
soon
following
some
clove
there
was
a
lingering
bitterness
to
the
taste
i
was
very
ambiguous
about
this
beer
the
bitterness
really
persisted
and
while
not
unpleasant
it
wasnt
exactly
pleasant
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
overall
not
bad
but
i
would
have
just
one
i
might
try
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
though
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
thick
creamy
head

big
bubbles
but
quickly
falling
the
aroma
is
cereal
earthy
grainy
and
definitely
spicy
the
taste
is
also
spicy
earthy
and
cereal

quite
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
seems
very
appropriate
for
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
smooth
spicy
and
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
it
didnt
do
anything
for
me
though
i
thought
it
was
rather
middle
of
the
road
i
did
like
the
malty
surprise
in
the
flavor
overall
not
bad
but
seems
too
simplistic
to
enjoy
that
often
seems
like
not
so
much
flavor
other
than
light
malt
and
hop
bitterness
overall
worth
trying
i
would
say
but
not
because
of
any
particular
thing
it
is
just
a
very
mysterious
beer
here
there
but
nowhere
i
suggest
trying
to
mix
up
the
sediment
in
the
beer
as
it
seemed
to
provide
a
more
even
and
smooth
experience
d
a
nice
surprise
after
liking
but
not
being
that
impressed
with
the
de
ranke
xx
bitter
the
flavours
here
work
better
and
are
less
astringent
than
the
former
a
hopped
up
bspa
is
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
christmas
beer
in
belgium
but
it
works
pretty
well
palate
is
spicy
earthy
fruity
complex
pale
malts
and
yeasty
esters
spicy
hops
and
peppery
finish
litemedium
body
and
prickly
carbonation
helps
tie
the
flavors
together
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
pick
up
another
bottle
if
i
could
very
much
like
xx
bitter
but
without
the
palate
bombing
bitterness
definately
from
the
same
brewery
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
drinkability
overall
a
very
easy
drinker
but
im
taking
points
off
a
little
for
the
unique
flavors
that
i
think
might
put
some
people
off
a
bit
the
beer
is
very
hazy
and
unfiltered
pale
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
frothy
head
there
is
so
much
foam
that
it
slowly
gushed
out
of
the
bottle
after
popping
the
cork
the
aroma
is
of
a
hopped
belgian
beer
with
some
spices
kind
of
la
chouffeish
or
maybe
urthel
hopitish
the
taste
is
more
of
a
bitterer
version
of
duvel
nice
and
easy
drinking
but
not
an
everyday
beer
i
prefer
the
bitterness
of
american
pale
ales
or
ipas
to
this
drinkabilitygreat
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
although
the
christmas
theme
throws
me
off
a
little
bit
i
always
can
appreciate
a
hopped
up
belgian
beer
the
best
holiday
beer
of
the
season
for
me
get
some
i
have
a
year
old
750ml
that
i
might
crack
soon
definitely
an
interesting
brew
i
have
to
give
de
ranke
credit
for
one
thingthey
always
make
something
i
can
form
an
opinion
on
but
this
is
harder
to
do
so
than
the
others
i
like
it
but
theres
something
about
that
peppery
hop
character
that
is
a
double
edged
sword
imo
i
imagine
this
could
be
paired
very
well
with
certain
sweet
foods
glazed
meats
and
such
on
its
own
the
peppery
hops
just
kinda
bug
me
though
if
you
like
bitter
nonoily
hops
that
dont
have
that
profound
tart
character
check
this
one
out
if
youlike
anything
from
de
ranke
this
is
definitely
required
drinking
overall
not
really
a
bspa
i
like
its
not
bad
but
its
leaving
me
wanting
a
fuller
and
sweeter
beer
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
wouldnt
think
about
getting
it
again
so
sorry
pere
noel
still
not
loving
you
hops
are
subdued
in
the
taste
but
definitely
present
light
bitterness
in
the
background
with
a
soft
cheesy
hop
character
orange
peel
and
fruit
esters
are
also
present
yeast
gives
a
certain
level
of
smoothness
carbonation
is
soft
the
750
was
split
two
ways
which
is
probably
the
ideal
serving
the
hops
seemed
to
build
up
and
numb
the
palate
a
little
bit
last
year
i
remember
this
being
more
earthy
and
spicy
without
much
of
hop
character
maybe
this
is
a
fresher
bottle
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
in
what
i
would
hope
to
be
the
brewers
best
effort
at
a
festive
ale
almost
flat
feeling
medium
body
carbonation
isnt
where
it
should
be
i
made
it
through
about
half
of
this
750ml
bottle
but
have
no
desire
to
finish
it
its
a
shame
really
because
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
i
liked
it
a
new
style
a
hoppy
belgian
winter
warmer
spices
dont
beat
you
over
the
head
sweetness
is
faint
and
the
body
is
rather
light
a
bit
like
a
saison
odd
winter
offering
abv
reasonable
spices
light
not
sweet
or
heavy
mouthfeel
very
soapy
and
overly
astringent
hard
to
drink
notes
so
hard
to
think
of
this
in
a
belgian
category
as
the
hoppy
craze
is
catching
on
even
in
a
traditional
style
i
liked
the
way
it
worked
and
will
buy
one
again
on
occassion
but
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
which
hides
its
abv
pretty
darn
well
ill
gladly
buy
another

it

there

shows
thru
as

like
not
overly
yeasty
with
a
nice

profilei
would
buy
again
for
sure
a
nice
treat
on
tap
what
a
great
beer
complex
bitter
and
hoppy
neat
dryness
and
complex
this
is
not
entirely
different
in
feel
and
complexity
of
the
st
bernardus
beers
that
i
have
recently
had
do
they
share
the
same
primary
yeast
strain
anyway
the
minerally
oranginess
gets
tiring
for
me
it
is
a
topnotch
beer
but
that
flavor
profile
is
not
usually
what
i
am
looking
for
i
think
i
will
stick
with
my
xx
for
the
most
part
pours
a
hazy
pale
amber
with
a
good
head
smells
slightly
metallic
and
hoppy
with
some
citrus
background
taste
is
very
hoppy
but
with
soft
hops
and
lemon
citrusy
bubblegum
and
other
yeasties
on
the
finish
fairly
unusual
and
interesting
soft
mouthfeel
but
crisp
quite
drinkable
d
im
finding
that
im
not
a
fan
of
bitters
outside
the
us
i
guess
i
find
them
boring
and
uncomplete
this
beer
did
grow
on
me
over
time
though
d
easy
drinking
but
im
not
sure
thats
how
one
would
like
to
start
out
rating
the
drinkability
i
wasnt
wowed
by
this
brew
it
wasnt
bad
but
nothing
amazing
or
out
of
the
ordinary
spicy
in
the
nose
but
nothing
in
the
taste
although
this
is
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
would
take
out
the
strong
noel
no
christmas
spices
here
id
pass
on
this
as
its
not
worth
the
1213
mouthfeeldrinkabiliity
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
biting

the
finish
drinkability
but
would
be
better
if
it
were
not
quite
so
dry
d
this
is
an

brew
quite

more
as
the
bottle
emptied
it
is
really
an
intriguing
beer
that
i
would
recommend
trying
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
its
not
exciting
yet
i
doubt
i
could
call
it
bland
beers
like
this
inconvenience
me
because
of
this
problem
though
i
routinely
enjoy
them
body
is
medium
well
carbonated
with
a
fluffy
airey
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
and
not
overly
complex
comments

i
got
a
ton
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
gotta
love
it
aroma
is
slightly
musty
with
spicyfruity
notes
just
beneath
orange
tinted
tan
in
color
with
a
diminishing
thumb
thick
white
head
has
a
crisp
tartness
in
the
fore
and
ample
orange
peel
notes
that
arent
truly
bitter
but
none
the
less
hold
that
citrusy
peel
flavor
some
wholesome
sweetness
that
is
breadsweet
rather
than
candysweet
though
there
is
a
fruity
apple
mostly
sweet
twang
in
the
finish
the
mustiness
of
the
aroma
is
evident
again
in
the
flavor
carbontion
is
medium
to
low
but
complimentary
to
the
beer
had
a
bottle
a
year
later
at
cellar
temperature
and
observed
a
nicely
cellared
spicey
yeast
melange
good
drinking
a
year
and
a
half
later
just
as
good
hazy
light
tangerine
in
color
with
a
light
head
of
white
foam
that
coats
the
glass
fairly
well
strongly
floral
slightly
metallic
lightly
smoky
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
and
bright
fruits
which
give
an
orangetangerine
scent
airy
coating
feel
light
spice
flavor
bright
yeasty
tones
with
bright
fruit
flavors
with
a
hint
of
herbs
very
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
tangerine
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
that
disappates
quickly
the
smell
is
of
candied
fruit
orange
citrus
peach
grassyhay
wheat
notes
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
apricot
flavor
then
hits
you
with
a
slight
alcohal
essence
then
follows
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
that
compliments
the
whole
beer
merry
christmas
this
was
my
2005
christmas
beer
of
choice
based
solely
on
my
affinity
for
the
xx
bitter
and
guldenburg
not
being
home
with
my
usual
drinkware
i
was
forced
into
using
a
standard
wine
glass
the
instant
after
uncorking
a
mountainous
fizz
overflowed
and
consistently
did
so
until
the
pour
it
poured
a
lighter
caramel
color
with
an
off
white
head
thats
dense
and
frizzy
with
very
good
lace
the
nose
is
woody
clovish
and
pale
enticing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
acidic
grit
to
it
the
flavors
are
many
appley
and
casklike
up
front
with
lingering
clove
spiciness
all
tied
neatly
with
a
citrus
hop
character
that
is
hardly
subdued
the
finish
is
peppery
with
hints
of
oaken
wood
and
a
dryness
that
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
that
would
be
well
served
to
lay
down
for
a
year
in
fact
i
may
grab
myself
another
one
today
for
next
christmas
offering
prosit
my
brother
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
for
xmas
as
well
at
first
maybe
i
thought
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
nope
tasted
exactly
the
same
he
couldnt
even
drink
it
and
hes
just
as
much
a
beer
nerd
as
me
again
i
could
maybe
undersand
it
but
thought
the
flavors
just
didnt
meld
the
drinkability
is
very
good
very
smooth
and
complex
hazy
yellow
orange
with
decent
fluffy
white
head
light
sweet
fruit
notes
with
a
light
spicing
not
much
else
maybe
a
little
yeast
stands
out
as
it
warmed
but
it
was
a
very
mild
aroma
more
fruit
with
the
flavor
that
was
also
backing
with
a
light
dusting
of
spices
a
nice
subtle
grassy
hoppiness
melds
in
well
ends
with
a
dry
spicy
finish
decent
enough
body
and
easily
drinkable
it
wasnt
bad
it
just
seemed
a
bit
too
mild
for
its
own
good
drinkability
yummy
brew
that
makes
one
think
of
a
belgian
ipa
if
there
is
such
a
thing
glad
i
got
to
try
it
ill
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
it
again
750
ml
bottle
with
a
cork
and
cap
pours
a
cloudy
glowing
orange
with
a
huge
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
flowery
musty
lemon
aromas
apple
pear
citrus
and
spicy
pepper
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
perfect
finishes
dry
and
bitter
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
on
this
thing
is
creamy
magical
caressing
simply
amazing
overall
the
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
now
i
can
only
thank
god
that
there
are
still
6
ounces
or
so
left
in
the
bottle
for
me
to
enjoy
this
was
a
gem
i
was
enjoying
it
too
much
to
take
good
enough
notes
the
mouthfeel
hit
me
as
exceptional
as
the
start
was
crisp
and
the
finish
was
lightly
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
spices
last
long
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
holiday
brew
taste
a
light
airy
fruitiness
gave
way
immediately
to
a
sharp
hops
bitterness
that
really
dried
out
the
beer
in
the
middle
some
sharp
acidic
fruits
rose
up
on
the
finish
these
became
a
little
sweeter
in
the
aftertaste
where
they
were
joined
by
a
light
amount
of
roasted
malt
overall
dry
with
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
being
bitter
and
sharp
best
before
september
2008
so
about
1
5
years
of
aging
pours
in
perfectly
clear
with
good
head
and
a
nice
bronze
colour
smell
is
delightingly
fruity
mostly
yeast
but
still
litle
hops
there
most
of
the
nose
though
is
very
creamy
orange
peach
first
sip
makes
you
notice
the
used
hops
in
high
amounts
and
still
present
2
nd
sip
made
me
get
the
nice
and
fruity
arome
that
reminds
me
of
good
tripel
after
that
i
found
also
litle
malt
and
hops
hops
great
brew
also
to
lay
down
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
the
style
in
conclusion
this
beer
was
unimpressive
and
overpriced
by
about
9
99
money
better
spent
on
something
else
such
a
shame
for
a
beer
with
a
great
picture
on
the
label
750
ml
bottle
opened
on
122504
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
an
excellent
treat
for
christmas
night
drinkable
id
say
god
i
love
belgian
strong
pale
ales
this
offering
isnt
as
forceful
as
most
in
this
case
that
is
a
good
thing
liquid
gold
amazing
i
purchased
a
750ml
in
burnsville
mn
one
bottle
was
not
enough
holiday
brew
this
is
liquid
jesus
this
was
my
reason
for
going
to
richos
today
it
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
sweet
fruity
strawberry
and
caramel
with
a
nice
peppery
background
the
flavor
is
great
wonderful
sweet
caramel
balanced
with
a
spicey
pepper
and
a
great
spicey
hop
on
the
finish
that
sits
on
my
tongue
good
good
beer
the
feel
was
moderatly
thick
and
velvety
smooth
drinkability
is
awesome
so
easy
drinking
sweet
and
balanced
i
really
liked
it
a
lot
definately
refreshing
a
big
changeup
in
the
christmas
beer
lineup
i
enjoyed
the
full
hop
bitterness
and
fruity
nose
but
cant
help
but
think
that
the
flavor
could
have
been
better
definately
one
to
try
out
again
next
year
or
even
let
another
bottle
lie
for
awhile
had
this
at
the
moan
and
doves
2nd
birthday
party
what
a
fun
time
pours
with
a
fairly
big
head
nice
and
puffy
clearish
light
amber
color
soft
looking
smells
a
bit
funky
definate
wheat
presence
with
a
tad
of
dirt
in
there
also
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
and
a
floral
hop
profile
tastes
almost
watery
but
not
in
an
bad
way
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
beer
with
a
shot
of
wheat
grass
thrown
in
very
musty
and
yeasty
indeed
sweet
malt
notes
here
and
there
with
a
bitter
dry
hop
finish
for
the
mouthfeel
drinkable
yes
but
you
probably
want
to
take
your
time
with
this
one
id
say
as
its
pretty
complex
got
this
is
the
dark
brown
bottle
with
the
tissue
wrap
the
cork
was
very
dry
almost
broke
off
into
the
beer
when
opening
very
unimpressive
looks
like
a
beautiful
unfiltered
gem
but
doesnt
back
it
up
in
the
taste
only
recommended
for
purists
looking
to
sample
it
all
this
bottle
seem
to
contain
quite
a
bit
of
foam
just
waiting
to
flow
out
the
top
one
the
cork
was
out
it
formed
a
very
murky
light
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dispated
quickly
considering
all
the
foam
that
flowed
out
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
was
of
yeast
hops
and
some
spices
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
spices
hops
and
some
breaddough
aspects
the
body
was
fairly
light
and
the
finish
was
complicated
with
aspects
of
spices
with
a
small
bit
of
astrigency
very
light
finish
750
ml
wrapped
in
paper
without
a
label
on
the
bottle
the
first
pour
from
a
longstanding
750ml
bottle
is
surprisingly
clear
and
its
amber
body
displays
orange
and
gold
highlights
beneath
a
magnificent
pillow
of
soft
and
creamy
white
foam
the
second
glass
becomes
murky
with
the
lees
but
the
brilliant
head
remains
and
it
holds
exceptionally
well
leaving
some
very
nice
rings
of
lace
about
the
goblet
the
nose
is
fresh
exciting
and
enticing
with
a
combination
of
lightly
fruity
earthy
and
mildly
musty
yeast
delicately
sweet
malt
and
bright
grassy
hops
in
the
mouth
its
very
finebubbled
carbonation
is
not
as
effervescent
as
might
be
expected
but
rather
median
and
its
medium
body
combines
with
it
to
leave
it
just
lightly
tingly
and
then
velvety
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
to
the
contrary
it
slowly
draws
you
in
bit
by
bit
some
light
juicy
and
subtly
tart
fruit
appears
upfront
immediately
backed
by
a
soft
delicately
candyish
malt
that
wraps
it
like
a
blanket
as
a
pillow
of
grassy
lightly
floral
and
somewhat
spicy
hops
appear
or
are
they
spicy
bolder
peppery
notes
appear
almost
at
the
same
moment
and
a
flick
of
alcohol
is
present
as
well
so
is
the
peppery
spiciness
coming
from
the
alcohol
spices
hops
or
a
combination
of
all
three
who
knows
who
cares
it
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
pepper
and
a
combination
of
citrusy
and
driedapricotlike
fruitiness
that
leaves
you
only
partially
satiated
and
wanting
more
raspy
pinelike
notes
and
a
bolder
bitterness
develop
at
the
back
of
the
throat
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
almost
begging
you
to
go
back
to
the
supple
juciy
and
citrusy
fruit
found
at
the
start
wow
what
an
enticing
beer
its
certainly
not
what
one
might
expect
of
a
holiday
ale
think
bolder
spicier
as
its
so
much
more
the
seductress
refined
elegant
regal
perhaps
a
brilliant
pale
ale
that
should
be
available
yearround
and
welcome
on
the
dinner
table
at
any
time
very
nicely
done
overall
impression
i
guess
im
just
not
sure
what
makes
a
christmas
beer
a
christmas
beer
to
me
it
should
be
quite
different
from
the
norm
more
flavor
more
spice
more
color
and
some
archivability
this
just
seems
like
a
usual
belgian
beer
its
good
though
hops
still
mellowing
in
this
i
think
another
year
wouldnt
have
hurt
at
all
3
4
years
in
a
bottle
might
be
best
for
this
gem
a
creamy
peachlike
orangeish
hue
with
a
lovely
creamy
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
the
aromas
are
of
melon
different
fruits
spicy
alcohol
yeast
belgian
candi
sugar
and
fresh
floral
just
cut
hops
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aromas
and
follows
thorugh
wonderfully
as
loren
said
this
stuff
is
a
hop
heads
version
of
duvel
that
is
definately
a
good
way
to
sum
this
beer
up
it
tastes
of
candy
coated
hops
honey
different
spices
and
flowers
belgian
candy
sugar
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
light
on
the
tongue
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well

the

an
off

with
the

a

cover
the

fruit
laden

to
me
an
over
ripe

also
somewhat
musk
like
or
musty
like
an
old
wine
cellar
not
bad
mind
you
just
quite
different
some
malt
tones
at
the
back
with
the
start
sweet
nicely
malted
tart
and
somewhat
vinous
top
is
light
but
rich
in
feel
meekly
carbonated
finish
bitter
hops
understated
alum
dry
aftertaste
different
from
what
i
would
normally
drink
so
it
takes
a
lot
of
contemplation
to
be
accurate
in
my
judgment
drinkable
but
something
id
not
want
to
sample
on
a
regular
basis
but
after
some
serious
decanting
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
more
pleasing
to
my
palate
so
if
your
not
into
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
even
if
it
means
pouring
a
bit
of
the
beer
back
into
the
bottle
you
may
make
a
serious
misjudgment
of
taste
had
on
tap
at
redbones
made
me
sing
father
christmas
the
rest
of
the
evening
anyway
pour
was
a
dark
gold
color
no
head
very
clean
aroma
i
didnt
pick
up
much
action
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
darn
smooth
and
even
though
i
knew
it
had
some
punch
alcohol
wise
i
really
couldnt
tell
when
drinking
it
definitely
some
candi
sweetness
in
the
finish
while
good
and
definitely
well
blended
there
wasnt
so
much
going
on
with
this
one
might
be
a
good
choice
for
a
novice
no
off
notes
detected
with
this
one
pat
this
beer
is
damn
good
so
far
de
ranke
has
really
impressed
me
this
is
a
really
good
mix
of
flavors
very
well
balanced
walks
a
wonderful
line
between
sweet
on
the
one
hand
and
dry
on
the
other
appearance
amber
orange
cloudy
with
an
effervescent
bubbly
carbonation
this
one
was
done
in
small
batches
reminscient
of
some
hard
to
find
farmhouse
ales
lacing
is
excellent
fine
belgian
webbed
patterns
aroma
a
bouquet
of
floral
hallertau
blended
with
a
piney
honey
tinged
tone
with
a
streak
of
spicing
to
bring
holiday
cheers
taste
i
absolutely
fell
in
love
with
this
belgian
rarity
possibly
up
there
on
my
all
time
favorite
belgian
ales
as
well
as
christmas
beers
ive
tasted
fruity
tones
accented
and
surrounded
by
the
rush
of
pine
cone
like
hops
so
excellent
this
kind
of
hopping
with
the
lucious
malt
backbone
this
is
the
ruination
of
belgian
bier
just
a
step
below
properings
hommel
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
champagne
like
carbonation
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
drinkability
my
lord
i
indulged
in
this
beer
at
the
sharp
edge
on
a
thursday
by
saturday
this
beer
was
sold
out
there
they
moved
two
cases
like
nothing
found
it
at
ds
sixpack
and
picked
up
their
last
two
bottles
just
excellent
for
a
dinner
brew
or
just
if
chilling
around
and
the
snows
coming
down
crack
one
of
these
babies
it
will
put
a
smile
on
your
face
pours
a
magnificent
cloudy
burnt
siennaorange
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
strange
aroma
can
discern
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
peppermint
malt
and
possibly
some
other
spices
but
subdued
taste
is
most
unique
unlike
anything
else
ive
tried
i
recommend
that
if
you
find
a
bottle
buy
it
cant
miss
the
pale
green
wrapper
on
it
mouthfeel
is
most
excellent
effervescent
and
crisp
a
lingering
astringent
aftertaste
of
lightly
zesty
hops
and
dull
peppermint
leaves
totally
unique
for
a
christmas
beer
floored
by
it
man
this
is
good
awesome
deep
honeyedtan
color
with
plenty
of
mouthwatering
sticky
beige
head
to
welcome
one
and
very
adequate
lace
that
leaves
a
patch
of
web
throughout
on
the
nose
malty
sweetness
meets
beeswax
scented
hop
the
smell
of
the
candy
sugar
is
also
evident
as
is
a
very
inviting
while
subtle
fruitiness
in
the
mouth
the
beer
hits
all
the
buds
sweetness
can
be
found
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
while
bitter
teases
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
literally
attacks
the
sides
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
great
strong
pale
ale
and
reminds
me
of
a
saison
on
roids
this
is
a
big
hoppy
brew
that
is
oh
so
refreshing
and
clean
the
finish
with
its
bitter
hop
and
grapefruit
zest
like
burn
goes
on
and
on
and
on
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
this
year
no
question
get
as
much
as
you
can
of
this
beaut
the
surprise
of
the
holiday
season
so
far
and
probably
will
be
for
the
whole
season
simply
fantastic
and
an
excellent
use
of
hops
and
certainly
one
i
will
have
again
if
i
ever
find
it
again
thanks
to

for
splitting
this

with

to
improve

the

are
more
pronounced
than
they
are

not

but
easy
drinking
for
those
easy

as
its
sister

it
is
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
though
this
one
is
heavily

a
pleasant

i
would
happily
partake

this
is
a
delight
to

with

very
difficult
to
believe
that
this

mellow

is

completely
covered

o
this
beer
has
a
nice
amount
of
dryness

complex

from
the

poured
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
a
12
oz

into

poured
a
hazy

produced

of

nice
version
of

nice
session
beer
o
this
would
be
a
fantastic
first
round
in
a
belgian
tasting
this
beer
would
set
the
stage
beautifully
to
be
followed
by
a
dubbel

quad
this
beer
is
like

overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
think
its
a
really
good
value
if
youve
never
tried
it
there
is
no
reason
to
hesitate
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
across
the
board
but
nothing
really
special
smells
sweet
taste
is
good
strong
bite
for
such
an
easy
flavor
a
bit
astringent
i
like
leffe
a
lot
and
this
does
not
quite
meet
that
because
of
the
bitterness
leffe
is
smoother
i
do
like
the
label
of
the
beer
and
the
brewery
does
seem
to
offer
traditional
belgian
styles
i
will
try
some
of
there
other
beers
smells
strongly
of
belgian
yeasty

of
funky
belgian
yeast
with
a
middlingsized
dollop
of
spicy
phenols
over
the
top
of
a
blend
of
light
pear
and
apple
esters
with
a
certain
raw
cereal
graininess
and
a
very
light
minty
hop
garnish
in
the
finish
its
pretty
good
but
the
bottled
version
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
hazy
memory
from
a
certain
special
night
of
revelry
in
which
i
had
it
fresh
from
the
tap
sadly
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
my
notebook
along
that
evening
and
i
am
left
with
naught
but
hazy
and
nostalgic
glowing
memories
of
a
draft
pour
that
this
bottle
did
not
quite
live
up
to
ah
memories
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
pour
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
for
a
head

was

bland

lifeless
very
light

like
a
light
lager
notes
of
mild
yeast
pear
and
stone
fruit
a
hint
of
grass
and
tealike
hops
on
the
plus
side
this
beer
sure
went
down
easy
lightbodied
low
carbonation
and
a
barelynoticeable
8abv
but
the
lack
of
any
good
flavor
just
made
this
a
downer
for
me
and
for
the
price
it
just
wasnt
worth
it
at
all
pours
a
slightly
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy

that
settles

on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruits
spices
and
some
perfumelike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
soapy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
but
smells
better
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
is
listed
on
the
bottle
as
7
5
on
tap
at
jacs
madison
underwheiming
a
nice
flavor
to
be
sure
and
refreshing
on
this
hot
summer
afternoon
but
although
it
resembles
other
belgian
pales
with
its
belgian
yeast
and
round
sweetness
like
atomium
piraat
and
delirium
tremens
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
others
in
character
or
distinction
on
tap
at
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
o
good
beer
for
summer
well
drinkable
and
a
short
finish
picked
up
a
bomber
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
new
and
belgian
this
brew
turned
out
very
much
like
i
expected
and
that
is
a
pretty
good
description
overall
rock
solid
no
surprises
pours
a
cloudy
light
bronze
with
a
fizzy
white

that
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
of
light
fruit
telltale
belgian
yeast
and
coriander
taste
is
light
with
noncitrus
as
well
as
light
noncitrus
fruit
also
coriander
and
other
earthy
but
light
spice
the
elevated
abv
is
very
well
buried
very
nice
i
will
buy
again
overall
good
beer
overall
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
grab
a
330
if
you
can
im
not
too
deep
into
this
750
and
not
so
excited
about
the
finish
kind
of
a
confusing
drink
where
some
elements
really
rise
above
the
average
blonde
while
others
simply
fall
short
however
the
alcohol
level
is
hidden
very
well
overall
it
seems
to
be
less
than
the
sum
of
its
pieces
its
not
bad
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
were
offered
but
its
nothing
like
competitive
with
duvel
or
don
de
dieu
in
the
style
so
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
looking
yellowish
gold
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
grains
and
some
bready
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
wheat
beer
more
than
a
pale
ale
the
flavors
were
soft
and
finished
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
drinkable
and
had
a
lot
of
sporatic
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
decent
i
think
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
was
nice
to
try
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
work
really
well
together
this
beer
is
ideal
for
the
warmer
weather
and
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
for
sure
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
just
not
enough
to
keep
my
interest
very
long
nose
quite
well
fermented
yeast
citrus
perceives
in
the
background
the
taste
is
average
not
great
folly
just
with
a
peach
syrup
rough
but
not
that
exciting
and
gives
a
too
syrupy
beer
this
is
not
to
do
him
honor
slight
aftertaste
unappetizing
a
beer
just
average
o
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
delicate
and
lightly
flavored
but
an
easy
drinker
as
well
beer
is
light
in
body
and
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
nice
yeast
and
floral
flavors
of
the
beer
throughout
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
but
not
overly
so
this
is
a
solid
decent
beer
from
a
good
brewery
used
to
be
a
staple
of
mine
when
i
was
stranded
in
the
former
beer
desert
of
florida
i
would
and
have
had
this
again
i
expect
of
a
beer
to
bring
real
joy
this
is
a
classic
example
the
sun
starts
shining
even
when
it
is
midnight
a
big
soapy
white
head
of
3
fingers
appeared
before
the
pale
gold
body
with
a
light
haziness
revealed
itself
splothcy
lace
nose
is
typical
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
reminiscent
of
duvel
in
many
respects
spicy
light
floral
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
prevalent
sweetness
and
some
light
fruity
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
pear
taste
is
spicy
with
a
high
carbonation
to
compliment
it
sweet
malts
take
over
as
the
carbonation
trickles
away
with
a
flash
of
alcohol
that
isnt
too
subtle
some
mild
graininess
also
high
carbonation
with
some
good
drinkability
not
something
to
usurp
duvel
of
its
title
in
the
style
but
certainly
pleasant
and
a
nice
example
o
not
bad
aromaflavor
were
good
but
seemed
a
little
weak
based
on
other
reviews
i
would
give
it
another
try
the
cpj
overall
this
beer
does
not
stand
out
as
much
as
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
at
that
point
i
had
only
tried
3
or
so
belgian
ales
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
dangerously
drinkable
highly
recommended
really
tasty
and
balanced
with
only
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
aroma
was
afraid
this
would
be
a
little
too
sweet
but
it
was
really
easydrinking
had
a
sort
of
sweet
duvel
quality
to
it
d
a
well
made
very
drinkable
beer
d
high
abv
but
very
nice
on
a
sunny
evening
o
not
the
best
of
its
style
and
i
cant
justify
the
price
o
very
tasty
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
the
finish
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
but
overall
it
is
very
enjoyable
overall
not
bad
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
but
very
drinkable
especially
for
8
d
good
and
unique
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
more
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
sip
after
sip
a
pleasant
wellrounded
strong
belgian
ale
no
edges
here
outgoing
and
plays
well
with
others
until
i
suppose
that
hidden
alcohol
strength
becomes
blindingly
apparent
and
engenders
cravings
for
more
heady
darker
belgian
offerings
drinkability
a
good
belgian
brew
you
get
some
upfront
sweet
maltiness
a
complex
spice
character
and
a
nice
display
of
fruitiness
a
little
bit
of
everything
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
me
being
one
of
the
few
bspas
i
havent
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
double
wit
may
be
a
more
suiting
title
for
this
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
possessing
a
good
nose
taste
and
feel
its
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
worth
a
try
but
as
long
as
duvel
is
readily
available
to
me
ill
be
sticking
to
it
very
wheaty
in
fact
the
brewery
owner
told
us
the
beer
is
a
20
wheat
brew
the
beer
is
named
after
adolphe
sax
inventor
of
the
saxophone
who
was
from
the
nearby
town
of
dinant
jd
d
very
drinkable
not
a
whole
lot
to
ponder
and
nothing
to
complain
about
either
rather
average
overall
drinkabilityoverall
i
tasty
beer
if
you
like
sour
type
fruits
not
especially
complex
or
refined
but
tasty
unfortunately
the
tastes
build
up
quickly
so
not
a
real
drinker
the
sum
of
the
parts
just
dont
quite
add
up
for
me
with
this
beer
its
not
unpleasant
but
neither
is
it
impressive
d
very
good
indeed
this
was
a
favorite
at
the
parkway
tavern
an
overly
sweet
and
to
be
frank
simple
belgian
strong
ale
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
d
this
is
a
complex
layered
beer
that
is
flat
out
well
done
it
is
not
a
session
beer
for
me
as
after
a
couple
of
these
one
might
get
a
little
worn
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
though
maybe
not
as
ones
first
bspa
as
it
is
rather
aggressive
with
some
of
its
flavors
and
with
the
alcohol
warmth
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
bspa
that
is
more
on
the
spicy
than
fruity
side
extremely
stiff
competition
in
this
category
so
the
beer
is
obviously
way
better
than
its
rating
may
suggest
definitely
recommend
d
while
initially
really
impressive
it
started
to
peter
out
early
on
the
cherry
coming
out
in
the
taste
was
really
pleasant
but
on
the
whole
this
beer
is
jarring
in
how
different
its
smell
and
taste
are
id
probably
recommend
it
more
as
an
autumn
brew
than
for
spring
or
summer
overall

very

its
still
a

overall
i
was
quite

this
beer
it
was
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
time
i
have
it
again
reviewed
from
my
notes
it
has
an
opaque
dirtytarnished
gold
color
and
a
white
foam
head
there
is
some
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
good
combination
of
earthy
yeast
and
floral
hops
saxo
has
a
great
smooth
malty
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
it
has
a
clover
honey
sweetness
that
i
really
like
its
a
full
bodied
beer
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
feels
lighter
than
it
is
its
as
close
to
a
perfect
mouthfeel
as
i
can
recall
having
it
is
also
sumpremely
drinkable
this
glass
in
front
of
me
will
go
down
very
easily
i
could
drink
saxo
all
night
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
frothy
two
finger
head
that
stays
around
and
leaves
lace
a
classic
sour
yeasty
funk
of
orange
and
citric
notes
along
with
hints
of
sweet
malts
a
prickly
lively
beer
thanks
to
carbonation
that
citric
flavors
like
orange
and
dark
fruit
flavors
hints
of
apricot
and
pear
poke
through
in
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
some
caramel
and
candy
sugar
sweetness
as
well
mix
with
the
beer
for
a
smooth
ride
that
finishes

easy

quite
pleasant
bspa
the
8
quite
well

fruity
and
refreshing
this
beer
served
as
the
steaming
liquid
for
some
clams
and
then
went
great
with
the
clams
and
a
plate
of
pasta
the
finish
has
notes
of
pepper
spiced
apricots
phenolic
yeasties
and
more
then
ample
belgian
tastyness
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
offering
mouthfeeldrinkability
one
of
the
finest
textures
of
any
belgian
beers
ive
sampled
the
mouthfeel
is
stunning
smooth
and
rolling
foam
that
only
gets
better
the
longer
its
there
a
pleasant
surprise
from
the
depths
of
the
fridge
ill
gladly
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
the
style
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
everyday
belgian
beer
d
great
smell
and
balanced
taste
d
quite
drinkable
at
8
not
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ale
ive
had
but
its
still
very
good
and
very
solid
and
does
it
earn
an
extra
point
for
having
a
snail
playing
a
saxophone
on
the
bottleglass
yes
yes
it
does
d
a
rather
nice
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
since
the
belgians
make
lots
of
better
strong
pale
ales
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
mediocre
belgian
strong
pale
that
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
elite
brews
like
delirium
and
duvel
dont
be
afraid
to
give
this
one
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
top
notch
beer
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
though
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
billowy
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
only
a
short
while
holding
it
up
to
the
light
one
can
see
light
through
it
but
little
else
shapes
and
images
are
not
readable
aromas
of
light
fruit
mainly
apple
spices
and
a
mild
maltiness
are
detectable
its
not
a
strong
aroma
but
it
is
pleasant
the
taste
is
full
of
lighter
flavors
including
but
not
limited
to
apple
and
pear
cardamom
and
cinnamon
and
a
nice
earthy
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
that
blends
particularly
well
with
the
lingering
fruit
flavors
the
warming
alcohol
is
pronounced
after
the
taste
has
subsided
a
bit
which
is
something
i
certainly
appreciate
its
a
bit
fizzy
for
my
taste
but
its
light
and
refreshing
while
adding
enough
complexity
to
be
interesting
drinkability
a
good
belgian
brew
you
get
some
upfront
sweet
maltiness
a
complex
spice
character
and
a
nice
display
of
fruitiness
a
little
bit
of
everything
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
but
none
of
the
flavors
were
intense
enough
to
be
anything
more
worth
a
shot
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
belgian
strong
pale
ale
would
take
some
of
its
contempoaries
namely
duvel
over
it
any
day
but
i
think
i
would
put
it
slightly
above
delirium
tremens
notes
plenty
of
carbonation
made
for
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
saxo
since
i
am
a
big
fan
of
belgian
paleblonde
ales
and
it
did
not
disappoint
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
well
suited
for
either
dinner
or
casual
drinking
saxo
really
celebrates
the
succulent
sweetness
of
malt
with
candy
sugar
but
balances
with
yeasty
spice
with
little
influence
from
hops
spice
additions
or
unruly
off
flavors
this
beer
signifies
whats
best
about
belgian
beer
overall
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
i
just
wish
cacacole
beers
were
more
widely
available
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
spicy
aroma
with
light
fruit
and
slight

presence
very
quaffable
slightly
carbonated
and
spicy
with
a
sweet
dry

nice
balance
of

and
light

notes
apple
pear
grape
with
a
creamy
mouthful
my
bottle
was
7
5
not
the
8
quoted
above
taste
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
there
are
some
higher
alcohols
solvent
notes
and
a
warm
alcohol
feeling
one
of
these
belgian
superbalanced
beers
which
are
hard
to
describe
you
just
know
this
is
right
pours
an
amber
golden
colored
body
with
a
very
fizzy
medium
head
creamy
white
in
color
but
diminishing
good
lacing
has
a
flowery
aroma
and
some
fruit
has
a
spicy
flowery
taste
some
light
fruit
like
apple
pear
light
taste
pale
golden
color
that
appears
clear
decent
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
and
little
lacing
a
clearly
dominate
fruit
aroma
with
a
tinge
of
honey
fits
the
style
if
not
just
a
little
weak
crisp
body
with
a
sweet
initial
feel
and
a
dry
finish
average
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
easy
drinkability
but
a
little
weaker
than
then
the
belgian
blondes
im
used
to
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
pricy
but
quite
good
smells
nice
and
tart
with
a
lot
of
citrus
esters
immediately
apparent
then
hints
of
the
malt
backbone
tastes
quite
similar
though
hop
bitterness
comes
through
to
balance
the
tartness
some
earthy
malt
rounds
it
out
quite
well
balanced
overall
a
good
refreshing
belgian
d
very
drinkable
the
complexity
of
the
malt
and
yeast
profile
make
for
an
interesting
beer
that
goes
down
easily
due
to
its
dryness
nice
blend
this
time
around
same
color
with
lighter
belgian
sugar
cane
light
and
lemony
a
strong
clove
and
some
fruit
light
orange
mellow
hop
quite
refreshing
much
better
when
not
too
dated
overall
great
beer
glad
i
finally
reviewed
it
after
drinking
it
many
times
hints
of
fruit
maby
some
grapefruit
and
a
nice
yeastey
flavor
thier
is
a
strong
alcohoal
taste
in
the
finish
this
is
a
siper
for
sure
that
improves
as
it
warms
up
i
dont
know
if
it
was
worth
16
bucks
for
a
4
pack
but
i
had
to
have
it
for
the
art
work
on
the
bottle
i
would
drink
agan
and
have
added
one
bottle
to
my
cellar
overall
got
this
on
sale
for
104
pack
at
beers
of
the
world
i
found
this
an
excellent
belgian
blonde
very
well
balanced
flavorful
and
easily
drinkable
alcohol
is
hardly
detected
at
all
until
the
end
where
the
temperature
increases
it
may
sneak
up
on
you
would
pair
well
with
a
light
lunch
tuna
melt
ill
let
the
others
cellar
a
bit
before
cracking
another
one
open
for
some
reason
the
past
two
bottles
sampled
were
highly
over
carbonated
they
started
bubbling
and
producing
head
as
soon
as
i
popped
open
the
top
so
be
careful
with
yours
will
buy
again
though
drinkability
was
outstanding
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
light
yet
packed
with
flavor
furthermore
the
7
5
abv
was
hardly
noticeable
pair
this
one
with
a
mussel
pot
and
some
spicy
shrimp
or
drink
it
solo
for
a
refreshing
treat
on
a
warm
summer
day
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
20oz
pint
glass
firm
pour
results
in
a
3
finger
head
that
slowly
diminishes
color
is
a
hazy
amber
with
light
sediment
smells
of
yeast
citrus
fruits
and
an
underlying
sweet
funk
light
funk
and
wheat
on
the

lots
of
carbonation
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
carbonation
cleanses
the
palate
highly
drinkable
sweetness
could
become
cloying
this
is
a
simple
but
tasty
beer
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
rich
with
fruity
citrus
flavors
i
want
to
make
this
an
ice
cream
its
so
tasty
and
candylike
really
its
like
beer
and
fruit
smoothie
still
theres
enough
balancing
bitterness
and
carbonation
to
make
this
a
great
warmweather
beer
good
for
a
fruity
nonfruit
beer
mediumcolored
amberishgold
with
a
small
white
creamy
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
a

good
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
mild
mostly
belgian
yeast
and
some
malts
a
little
fruit
in
there
and
a
hint
of
spice
taste
is
bigger
than
the
aroma
but
not
big
by
any
means
more
belgian
yeast
straw
strawberry
it
starts
out
malty
and
on
the
sweet
side
but
finishes
dry
with
a
small
short
hit
of
hops
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
lightly
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
ooandah
about
pours
a
hazy
dark

color
with
a
nice
consistent
white
foam
cap
aromas
of
honey
butterscotch

sweetness
is

some

a

bitter

and
funky
belgian

moves
in
midway
the
yeast
is
a
bit
dirty
or
earthy
maybe
nice
level
of
carbonation
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thickish
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
particularly
for
8
taste
mouthfeel
closely
mirrors
the
smell
with
a
big
spicy
banana
bread
flavor
undertones
of
orange
peel
green
apple
and
clove
lighttomedium
in
body
sweetness
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
and
i
could
see
it
becoming
slightly
cloying
in
large
quantities
dcould
have
a
few
though
my
wallet
may
not
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
adds
a
fairly
drinkable
element
to
the
brew
the
carbonation
level
is
just
perfect
the
odd
must
flavor
still
nags
me
in
the
back
of
my
head
if
i
knew
what
it
was
maybe
it
wouldnt
bother
me
so
much
overall
i
have
had
much
better
in
the
past
it
was
just
not
my
thing
what
so
ever
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
just
way
too
bland
of
a
belgian
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
this
is
pretty
much
just
average
d
i
like
this
beer
alot
for
7
5
abv
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
lightness
makes
it
even
easier
nice
interesting
flavours
and
a
crisp
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
ive
bought
it
before
and
i
will
buy
it
again
call
me
crazy
but
it
really
reminds
me
of

chips
well
done
caracole
overallmisses
the
bar
compared
to
other
belgians
almost
sickly
sweet
to
me
and
lacks
the
complexity
of
others
belgians
cellering
might
improve
it
not
my
favorite
version
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
id
rather
have
with
food
definitely
not
a
beer
i
prefer
to
drink
on
a
whim
by
itself
drinkability
is
high
as
youd
expect
all
in
all
nothing
terribly
standout
here
but
no
real
weakness
either
easily
enjoyable
beer
will

of
a
belgian

not
particularly

highly

the

is

in
the
ultrasweet

light

flavor
has
a
strong
floral

grapefruit
essence
with
esters
and
a
grainy
candy
taste
not
completely
blown
away
by
this
sample
but
a
pleasing
depiction
nonetheless
a
very
sweet
sugarladen
brew
not
bad
at
all

some

tangy
with
a

like
flavor
seems
to
be
a
touch
of
mint
on
there
as
well
feel
is
nice
and
even
with
a
smooth
level
of
carbonation
oh
so
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
is
so
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
a
damn
good
bspa
though
lacking
the
complexity
that
other
heavy
hitters
carry
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
saxo
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
this
brew
pours
a
bright
golden
colour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settled
down
to
a
thin
skim
in
my
duvel
tulip
glass
in
relatively
short
order
the
smell
is
excellent
almost
liek
a
saison
its
got
a
bit
of
that
funky
sparp
belgian
character
that
i
love
the
taste
is
rather
light
fruity
and
a
bit
sharp
and
the
8
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
still
i
keep
thinking
saison
with
this
beer
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel

mediumly
carbonated

lively
a
sweet
aftertaste
stays
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
id
never

one
up

was
a
plus
big
thanks
to
the
thirsty
traveler
kevin
brauch
for
turning
me
on
to
this
little
brewery
in
belgium
i
first
had
this
at
a
beer
tasting
at
a
new
market
in
south
florida
and
ended
up
buying
a
six
pack
have
had
other
caracole
all
of
which
were
enjoyable
and
this
one
also
falls
into
that
group
i
guess
i
better
try
more
of
their
beers
if
you
havent
done
so
already
try
this
beer
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
good
solid
beer
very
drinkable
barely
showing
its
8
alcohol
superenjoyable
glad
i
got
a
4pack
this
time
hey
belgium
i
love
you
bham
uk
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
dies
down
quickly
smell
is
typical
belgian
with
a
yeasty
sweetness
and
no
hint
of
hops
the
initial
taste
is
refreshing
as
there
is
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
as
it
goes
down
a
slight
yeast
consistency
starts
to
develop
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
like
honey
as
well
a
hint
of
pepper
and
coriander
toward
the
end
this
beer
finishes
with
a
refreshing
and
near
neutral
taste
but
it
leaves
behind
a
syruplike
film

quickly

around

some

towards

the

lowish
carbonation
with
a
medium

and
a
bit
of

very
enjoyable
overall
theres
some
complexity
here
but
it
didnt
detract
from
the
drinkability
at
all
overall
a
decent
warm

option
a
little
pricey
but
wouldnt
turn
1
down
a
solid
belgian
ale
in
every
regard
very
good
drinkability
the
abv
is
hidden
and
didnt
prevent
me
from
finishing
the
entire
750
easily
myself
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
beer
in
this
style
for
the
price
if
you
have
access
to
this
snag
it
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
appears
a
cloudy
golden
color
head
is
quite
large
and
fluffy
initially
but
dies
down
to
a
thin
trace
after
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
hints
of
berries
and
banana
are
present
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
and
spicy
but
then
finishes
with
a
sweet
alcohol
flavor
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
well
above
average
overall
served
cool
not
cold
this
one
is
a
flavorful
warmweather
quencher
definitely
recommended
with
a
refreshing
sail
d
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
even
though
its
8
abv
a
great
beer
very
nice
drinkability
refreshing
despite
the
8
abv
something
ill
pick
up
again
if
i
see
it
a
good
beer
overall
but
not
caracoles
best
its
well
worth
the
7
i
paid
for
the
corked
and
caged
bottle
but
dont
expect
a
huge
wow
factor
expect
a
well
made
beer
that
i
think
needs
a
bit
more
hops
to
be
right
a
little
remaining
head
or
lace
wouldnt
hurt
much
either
a
very
nice
belgian
blond
i
like
the
shoutout
to
the

and
even
if
the

arent

at

along
with
notes

perhaps
coriander

is

d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
alcohol
does
not
stand
out
in
smell
or
taste
i
can
tell
it
is
there
after
taking
a
drink
and
now
that
i
have
finished
one
on
an
empty
stomach
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
strong
so
far
maybe
the
artesian
water
gives
this
beer
the
little
extra
kick
it
has
m
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
good
for
the
style
but
not
one
for
me
personally
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
probably
a
good
summer
beer
its
a
nice
beer
that
went
well
with
a
summer
day
the
dry
finish
was
very
thirst
quenching
i
like
this
beer
and
i
would
get
it
again
easily
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
it
goes
down
really
well
i
should
admonish
against
more
than
one
750
ml
per
session
due
to
abv
and
hence
lowering
drinkability
points

i
dont
think
i
can

this

is

works

id
recommend
this
to
anyone
go
out
and
try
it
i
think
its
the
best
so
far

this

very
drinkable

a
beautiful
blonde
color
with
a

head
that
hangs
around
and
dissipates
slowly
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
gives
a
combination
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
the
first
taste
on
the
palate
is
sweet
with
the
hop
bitterness
coming
and
going
complex
yet
it
tastes
a
little
like
a
saison
this
blonde
is
awesome
and
would
be
great
as
an
afterdinner
drink
the
alcohol
is
present
but
mild
as
it
mingles
with
the
sweetness
and
the
herbal
spicyness
of
the
hops
a
swirl
of
the
glass
actually
rejuvenates
the
aroma
a
good
froth
on
the
palate
releases
a
good
sour
taste
that
adds
to
the
sweetness
and
the
wellrounded
hops
this
was
very
drinkable
and
i
am
starting
to
appreciate
belgians
more

more

that

i
have
had

a

a

beer
its

it
disguises
its

abv
quite
well
approximately

for

case
of

x
330ml
ill
have
to
have
a
4pack
every
now
and
then
as
i
am
but
a
pauper
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
really
well
made
and
very
well
balanced
i
feel
it
is
slightly
underrated
because
of
the
brand
name
but
this
is
really
good
the
taste
brings
a
nutmeglike
woody
spice
with
pear
and
mild
nutty
malt
with
light
tangy
yeast
balanced
by
a
slight
alcohol
creeping
in
mid
palate
wtih
subtle
wheat
sweetness
and
toasted
flavor
with
a
bit
of
pepper
and
some
other
indistinct
spice
w
date
and
light
sweet
caramel
w
warming
accent
of
sugar
in
the
finish
which
has
a
flavor
of
alcohol
drying
the
palate
this
is
a
very
good
ale
better
than
i
expected
but
a
little
strong
alcoholwise
in
the
taste
with
heavy
yeast
and
spice
with
some
grain
in
the
taste
but
enjoyable
in
general
with
nice
combination
of
yeast
and
spice
o
much
better
than
the
standard
hoegaarden
but
there
are
touches
of
witbeer
in
here
the
fruity
and
spice
taste
and
variability
kept
me
back
at
this
for
more
sips
the
only
very
slightly
negative
comment
is
the
very
low
carbonation
o
its
a
fine
beer
feels
like
a
perfect
version
of
this
style
its
great
no
real
faults
and
for
that
i
will
rate
it
higher
but
nothing
really
interesting
here
feels
like
ive
had
this
brew
a
dozen
times
at
that
its

overall

belgian
strong
pale

that
is

all
year
round
overall
impression
a
richer
and
fuller
version
of
the
classic
wit
style
using
darker
malt
and
fuller
and
more
satisfying
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
achieved
othis
beer
is
a
nice
surprise
i
wasnt
entirely
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
beer
provides
a
nice
highoctane
summer
drink
the
lemon
and
orange
flavors
are
intense
but
this
brew
is
not
simply
a
highabv
wit
there
is
some
real
flavor
and
balance
here
nicely
done
o
this
beer
manages
to
hide
its
alcohol
rather
well
considering
its
strength
so
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
bustinwheels
very
tasteful
witbier
or
belgian
blond
ale
or
whatever
it
is
i
really
liked
it
that
is
a
whole
different
league
than
their
regular
stuff
doesnt
come
across
any
better
than
the
standard
hoegaarden
o
nice
one
its
nice
in
balance
with
the
alcohol
fruits
o
well
balanced
nice
belgian
ale
maybe
not
so
complex
as
others
but
very
refreshing
good
value
o
i
generally
like
this
beer
the
price
is
right
and
it
is
refreshing
it
isnt
the
best
of
its
style
but
it
is
drinkable
and
hoegaarden
pulled
off
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
i
think
they
went
overboard
on
the
banananess
but
in
fairness
im
drinking
this
at
a
slightly
higher
temp
maybe
around
5055f
perhaps
a
cooler
serving
temperature
would
show
better
the
carbonation
style
isnt
up
my
alley
too
foamy
o
very
decent
but
i
cant
stand
coriander
so
i
tipped
most
of
it

roast

this
beer
a
lot
more
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
seem
to
recall
thinking
it
tasted
like
a
hoegaarden
on
steroids
then
i
found
a
bottle
that
had
aged
about
a
year
in
my
cellar
and
it
definitely
wasnt
as
good
as
i
remember
now
that
im
drinking
a
fresher
bottle
it
still
does
not
taste
as
good
as
i
remember
perhaps
my
taste
has
changed
or
the
beer
has
id
guess
on
the
former
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
againway
too
many
better
beers
in
belgium

com
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
high
abv
wit
but
without
the
flavor
amped
up
o
pretty
much
everything
about
it
is
good
or
even
great
but
im
not
in
love
its
like
being
able
to
appreciate
how
good
a
renaissance
painting
is
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
on
your
wall
how
do
you
explain
perfection
how
do
i
explain
to
my
wife
that
i
found
something
in
a
bottle
that
does
for
me
what
she
can
never
do
i
wish
i
had
synesthesia
that
operated
by
taste
somehow
instead
of
sounds
or
words
this
is
the
closest
i
have
found
to
it
bought
a
bottle
at
the
seibu
department
store
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
at
seibu
hoegaarden
is
ranked
as
the
topselling
beer
however
i
noticed
this
grand
cru
standing
on
the
shelf
above
it
neglected
yet
inviting
i
took
it
home
ripped
its
clothes
off
and
drank
it
with
a
passion
it
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
wonderfully
creating
a
nice
thick
white
head
the
aromas
dancing
off
this
brew
were
out
of
this
world
fruity
and
hoppy
and
like
how
i
imagine
pixies
smell
the
taste
was
how
i
imagine
pixies
taste
fully
of
earthy
tones
that
have
been
doing
the
bump
with
fruits
from
enchanted
forests
i
couldnt
put
this
brew
down
i
couldnt
stop
and
i
wont
stop
try
this
beer
out
and
you
will
find
yourself
partying
with
puck
in
a
flowery
meadow
in
no
time
o
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
a
little
boozy
the
best
part
is
the
mouthfeel
it
has
heffe
qualities
and
im
not
sure
i
like
that
o
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
would
help
if
the
local
beer
prices
were
more
in
line
with
reality
for
having
traveled
half
way
around
the
world
this
beer
still
has
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
grand
cru
wit
beer
i
have
had
i
would
definitely
like
to
see
more
domestic
attempts
at
this
brew
style
o
reality
is
that
this
is
a
stronger
or
improved
version
of
the
classic
hoegaarden
in
usa
we
would
call
it
a
imperial
witbier

a

with
a
columptious

smells
very

yeasty
with
some

and

taste
is

complexes
well
with

as
the

great
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbination
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
d
considering
the
abv
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
be
visiting
again
soon
purchased
as
part
of
hoegaarden
gift
pack
that
had
been
sitting
on
my
cellar
for
some
time
the
beer
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
active
carbonation
body
into
a
snifter
and
had
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
had
some
very
present
hop
nose
with
some
good
citrus
tones
the
taste
was
an
enjoyable
mix
of
citrus
hops
bite
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
round
things
out
all
lined
by
some
spice
from
the
present
alcohol
touch
md
softly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
somehow
its
in
line
with
the
styles
of
tripel
or
strong
pale
ale
minus
the
assertive
perfumy
fruity
edge
a
rather
understated
and
mild
pale
ale
very
approachable
hoegaarden
grand
cru
pours
an
opaque
orangy
gold
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
smell
is
of
medicinal
phenols
and
bright
tropical
fruits
taste
is
very
nice
with
some
peppery
spice
showing
up
in
the
beginning
then
mroe
light
fruit
characters
such
as
orange
banana
pear
many
more
im
sure
that
im
not
getting
not
too
much
carbonation
but
the
hop
presence
gives
this
beer
one
hell
of
a
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
never
really
realized
how
well
until
now
sip
after
sip
all
i
want
is
more
one
is
simply
not
enough
for
me
maybe
a
few
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
although
i
havent
sampled
a
wide
variety
of
witbiers
this
one
comes
through
for
me
with
flying
colors
also
although
people
have
complained
that
this
one
is
too
similar
to
its
counterpart
i
still
firmly
believe
that
it
exceeds
it
and
is
certainly
worth
picking
up
cheers
looks
just
like
the
commercial
export
perhaps
a
touch
darker
smells
the
very
similar
if
not
the
same
taste
is
all
clementines
coriander
lemons
and
wheat
not
too
complex
or
interesting
and
really
seemingly
too
similar
to
regular
hoegaarden
to
deserve
its
own
name
alright
for
a
euro
or
two
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
incredibly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
and
still
a
solid
entry
in
the
witibier
style
this
one
is
fantastic
highly
recommended
tastes
a
litle
more
intense
although
the
higher
abv
works
well
with
the
flavor
this
is
obviously
stronger
than
the
original
flavor
has
a
lot
of
character
complex
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
to
thick
overall
this
is
a
good
one
for
sipping
but
i
dont
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
its
certainly
enjoyable
but
theres
an
inbalance
which
holds
this
beer
back
from
being
something
really
good
quite
an
interesting
beer
its
also
very
pleasant
and
its
light
enough
to
be
sessioned
easily
i
like
this
a
lot
bham
uk
this
is
definatley
the
big
brother
of
the
wit
notes
very
good
and
tasty
a
smooth
frothy
sudsy
mouthfeel
plenty
of
carbonation
wildly
refreshing
this
is
regular
hoegaarden
to
the
nth
degree
very
drinbkable
very
tasty
nicely
balanced
yes
notes
excellent
different
and
similar
to
the
original
at
the
same
time
the
only
complaint
is
the
alcohol
is
quite
strong
in
this
it
was
fairly
new
when
i
tried
it
but
it
really
detracted
from
the
subtle
and
spicy
flavors
i
just
wish
i
had
an
older
bottle
just
so
the
alcohol
could
mellow
out
drinkability
well
layered
flavors
make
this
a
beautiful
beer
this
does
not
taste
like
a
normal
wheat
beer
that
were
used
to
from
belgium
but
it
is
full
flavored
and
tasty
all
the
same
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
summary
a
fantastic
beer
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
platter
of
cheese
and
smoked
salmon
which
complemented
it
perfectly
highly
recommended
tastes
of
citrus
and
alcohol
bitter
spice
and
peppery
tasty
but
not
overly
complex
crisp
and
nice
bitter
finish
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
bought
in
a
st
barths
grocery
i
find
it
nice
to
drink
but
probably
would
not
bring
it
back
next
time
a
drinkable
beer
anyway
aint
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
focused
on
creating
a
more
complex
version
of
their
standard
wit
bier
and
they
did
a
heck
of
a
job
at
8
5
abv
you
wouldnt
know
it
was
so
high
the
flavors
own
this
beer
not
the
alcohol
try
it
on
the
beach
in
st
martin
if
you
can
there
is
grand
cru
i
have
liked
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
fresh
from
belgium
it
looked
nice
and
fresh
beautiful
head
and
a
whiff
of
cardemon
and
cloves
but
it
went
down
like
medicine
and
i
could
not
finish
much
at
all
tangerine
and
melon
harshness
every
flavour
i
avoid
regular
hoegaarden
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
this
was
a
treat
to
find
this
pours
with
a
very
generous
head
and
the
effervescing
of
the
bubbles
never
seems
to
stop
the
smell
is
very
citric
with
a
hint
of
wheat
much
like
the
original
the
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
it
is
much
less
sweet
than
regular
hoegaarden
or
hoegaarden
speciale
it
is
almost
as
if
the
lemon
is
taken
out
to
make
way
for
a
more
serioustasting
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
a
witbier
without
the
traditional
citrus
then
this
is
for
you
a
more
balanced
and
mature
version
of
hoegaarden
one
of
the
best
beers
from
hoegaarden
if
you
ask
me
i
dont
really
like
their
other
stronger
beers
julius
verboden
vrucht
but
this
one
on
the
contrary
is
very
tasty
powerful
yet
refreshing
recommended
tasty
all
the
way
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
hoegaarden
and
this
really
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
not
entirely
the
same
but
offers
some
similar
qualities
similar
to
a
belgian
strong
pale
than
a
witbier
but
its
still
a
winner
in
my
book
i
fear
that
i
may
never
taste
this
beer
again
this
is
a
fresh
fruity
beer
with
a
nice
big
taste
clearly
a
good
brew
so
what
is
this
one
of
hoegaarden
somehow
always
seems
to
be
blind
nothing
to
see
throug
sometimes
like
a
snowstorm
somtimes
like
a
london
fog
like
this
time
no
great
smell
a
litle
fruit
but
lots
of
oxidation
botle
refermentation
and
hardly
any
yeastsmell
what
a
dull
beer
and
that
for
that
content
of
alcohol
most
taste
comming
from
orange
peals
and
koreander
not

taste

sweet
aroma
some
spices
pepper
and
herbs
too
flavour
is
fairly
malty
with
a
distinct
peppery
touch
hints
of
oak
some
alcoholic
warmth
not
unpleasant
moderate
but
sufficient
bitterness
not
bad
at
all
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
like
hoegaarden
witbier
on
steriods
and
in
many
ways
it
is
the
strong
alcohol
tastes
makes
it
not
as
enjoyable
though
ill
stick
to
fin
du
monde
well
carbonated
with
a
very
smooth
fairly
filling
presence
in
the
mouth
id
never
have
guessed
the
abv
on
this
one
a
surprisingly
complicated
and
really
lovely
beer
thanks
to
frank4sail
for
this
one
the
head
was
dense
and
fine
it
faded
slowly
on
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
very
enjoyable
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
some
straw
a
hint
of
fresh
tomato
and
a
light
hint
of
bacon
fruity
very
lightly
citric
the
taste
is
decent
more
grapefruit
than
in
other
witbiers
nicely
floral
too
my
only
reason
to
complain
is
that
the
8
5
abv
become
a
bit
too
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
smooth
and
round
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
way
its
poorly
hidden
reduce
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
bottle
poured
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
huge
thick
head
with
great
retention
aroma
is
quite
spicy
with
what
seems
to
be
some
wheat
i
was
quite
surprise
by
the
taste
which
includes
a
fair
share
of
spices
some
sweet
malt
and
again
something
similar
to
wheat
i
thought
the
taste
was
closer
to
a
tripel
then
a
regular
belgian
ale
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
which
make
this
beer
even
more
enjoyable
god
i
wish
american
macros
would
taste
like
this
sometimes
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
considering
the
strength
not
too
interesting
overall
crisp
and
apply
like
a
drunken
apple
crisp
a
big
flavourful
wit
the
taste
very
pleasant
is
sweet
and
fruity
between
banana
and
citrusy
feels
malt
is
very
present
and
the
finish
slightly
hoppy
in
its
robust
body
comes
in
properly
i
could
have
definitely
had
a
few
of
these
unfortunately
i
only
had
one
a
friend
carried
back
from
belgium
for
my
birthday
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
head
mainly
because
id
poured
it
so
shittely
the
smell
was
quite
good
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
found
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
very
overpowering
which
tainted
an
otherwise
tasty
beer
normally
i
find
that
the
belgians
are
quite
skilled
at
hiding
the
alcohol
but
not
in
this
case
an
exotic
beer
but
probably
not
an
everyday
sort
of
drink
especially
for
the
price
the
grand
cru
is
yet
another
very
fine
brew
brought
from
a
friend
while
in
england
wow
what
a
pleasant
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
thick
orange
with
an
explosive
carbonated
white
head
that
maintains
itself
to
an
eighth
inch
all
glass
long
while
a
trail
of
lace
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
floral
with
stong
citric
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
the
taste
follows
the
citric
path
while
bringing
out
more
zest
with
tastes
of
tropical
banana
a
sweet
malt
and
soft
hop
a
soft
foamy
mouthfeel
swirls
the
taste
giving
no
hint
of
the
8
7
abv
that
provides
a
slight
gentle
warming
an
excellent
nonintrusive
must
try
brew
not
to
be
rushed
but
take
the
time
to
enjoy
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
just
very
very
strong
and
has
trouble
hiding
it
like
strong
belgian
ales
can
still
recommened
this
is
a
truly
wonderful
beer
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
beware
for
as
easy
as
it
is
to
drink
it
packs
a
punch
and
is
not
as
friendly
the
next
morning
thanks
goes
to
jeffboo
for
the
bottle
drinkability
a
solid
beer
not
outstanding
nothing
to
rave
about
but
its
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
pale
burnt
orange
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
is
very
busy
the
mouthwatering
aroma
consists
of
fruit
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
is
repetitive
of
the
smell
and
also
has
a
crisp
carb
bite
it
has
a
very
light
body
yet
bold
punch
and
it
finishes
just
lightly
dry
it
is
a
very
nice
warm
weather
brew
op

overall
impression
since
standard
hoegaarden
has
mostly
lost
its
appeal
to
me
gone
a
bid
bland
im
happy
to
report
that
this
is
quite
a
respectable
beer
the
brewery
retains
a
reasonable
amount
of
clout
with
this
one
and
forbidden
fruit
but
without
meneer
celis
there
to
hold
the
reins
the
beers
tend
to
change
very
nice
cloudy
orange
colour
with
a
big
white
head
rich
smell
of
citrus
smells
a
little
pepper
too
the
taste
is
very
peppery
with
some
hints
of
citrus
it
is
stong
but
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
you
just
feel
the
warmth
of
it
a
beer
for
warm
summer
evenings
dark
yellow
body
slightly
cloudy
very
effervescent
i
poured
and
a
hug
head
formed
i
went
to
use
the
restroom
and
when
i
came
back
yes
i
did
wash
my
hands
thank
you
the
head
was
bigger
very
nice
appearance
very
elegant
and
sparkling
although
heads
so
large
that
you
get
nothing
but
foam
for
the
first
few
sips
irritate
me
they
do
look
good
though
back
to
the
beer
the
coriander
is
subdued
a
bit
more
orangey
here
the
wheatmalt
is
bigger
here
and
appropriately
this
is
a
heavier
beer
i
get
a
little
oats
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
the
tiniest
bit
thick
good
beer
but
something
about
it
gives
it
lower
drinkability
than
the
looks
would
suggest
the
alcohol
content
is
noticeable
on
the
creamy
palate
of
this
smoothly
spicy
beer
full
bodied
and
moderately
long
lasting
it
is
overwhelmingly
wheaty
with
the
slightest
hint
of
tropical
fruit
something
about
this
beer
just
does
not
come
together
for
me
it
is
a
tasty
beer
but
something
about
it
just
did
not
gel
the
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
it
tastes
clove
and
alot
i
thought
to
myself
is
this
a
gingercookie
or
something
in
sweden
we
also
use
to
put
cloves
in
oranges
and
hang
em
up
in
red
strings
to
create
a
nice
christmassy
smell
but
in
beer
no
i
didnt
like
this
at
all
looking
at
the
other
reviews
i
see
most
people
liked
it
to
those
who
havent
tried
it
judge
for
yourself
this
is
just
my
opinion
brownishorange
with
a
cream
colored
head
and
a
nice
bit
lace
about
the
glass
the
weak
aroma
hinted
of
friuts
a
heavy
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
banana
seemed
to
be
a
bit
harsh
towards
the
end
overall
a
good
beer
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
however
will
not
be
excited
about
purchased
and
drunk
while
in
the
netherlands
cloudy
amber
color
rich
looking
brew
that
doesnt
dissappoint
with
its
flavor
complex
blend
of
yeast
wheat
spices
that
create
a
masterful
brew
that
satisfies
every
taste
sensory
and
some
others
as
well
yum
put
me
on
the
list
of
those
who
wish
we
could
get
it
in
the
us
a
very
nice
beer
but
maybe
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
or
something
and
has
certainly
seemed
to
dropped
off
a
bit
lately
but
still
very
nice
notes
ouch
this
beer
is
a
gift
from
the
gods
and
it
shall
smite
thee
and
then
make
the
drinker
feel
its
ever
holy
wrath
of
esters
and
alcohol
once
the
light
is
seen
then
the
mortal
shall
be
one
with
beer
serious
beer
a
beer
to
respect
and
enjoy
to
the
fullest
of
course
similar
to
its
commercial
counterpart
but
twice
as
tasty
a
bit
darker
and
strong
had
this
bought
for
me
at
kaffee
de
hopduvel
in
ghent
belgium
by
a
gentleman
named
vincent
and
family
he
mentioned
that
the
grand
cru
is
more
like
the
original
hoegaarden
prior
to
its
becoming
commercialized
wonderful
estery
aromas
with
banana
and
spice
notes
very
malty
sweet
with
loads
of
esters
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
wow
what
a
beer
most
of
rrs
brews
are
amazing
this
one
just
seemed
to
fall
short
of
the
standards
so
highly
set
by
the
others
ive
had

it

in
my

i
picked
this
up
at
my
local
grocery
store
600
miles
from
the
brewery
i
couldnt
believe
they
had
it
i
almost
passed
out
grabbed
a
bottle
rushed
home
to
taste
it
and
it
is
amazing
great
belgian
strong
pretty
much
seems
like
duvel
mini
almost
as
good
but
not
quite
as
much
as
i
want
to
say
damnation
is
in
the
shadow
it
is
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
bought
it
at
alpine
liqour
too
bad
i
only
bought
one
will
definitely
get
it
again
21915
got
a
bit
of
fruit
on
this
i
wasnt
expecting
opened
too
cold
so
really
evolved
as
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
very
smooth
taste
and
finish
a
very
balanced
and
refreshing
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
i
enjoyed
thoroughly
pretty
bitter
im
not
really
a
strong
ale
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
this
is
like
a
really
high
quality
shock
top
but
not
really
worth
the
money
was
not
expecting
such
a
smooth
strong
pale
really
enjoyed
this
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
yet
another
offering
from
rr
that
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
my
least
favorite
from
the
cork
in
cage
series
from
russian
river
not
true
belgian
strong
to
light
on
flavor
and
body
split
bottle
wmy
sis
in
law
whos
a
big
belgian
pale
fan
one
of
the
best
american
made
ive
had
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
belgian
yeast
lemon
biscuit
great
mouthfeel
carbonation
this
is
an
exceptional
belgian
strong
pale
ale
similar
brews
duvel
nebco
668
this
might
be
as
perfectly
put
together
as
any
in
the
style
ive
ever
had
truly
exceptional
balance
and
overall
feel
m
absolutely
fantastic
on
this
front
and
it
progresses
wonderfully
with
each
stage
feeling
a
little
different
crisp
the
flavors
pop
then
its
creamy
and
smooth
then
it
ends
a
little
dry
but
not
too
much
good
carbonation
fairly
light
bodied
notes
i
drank
this
with
just
over
year
of
age
on
it
outstanding
the
flavor
follows
with
orange
peel
a
refreshing
quality
despite
its
sweetness
then
onto
clove
sweet
apricot
and
peach
a
clean
drying
quality
in
the
back
o
this
is
extremely
refreshing
i
wish
this
came
in
a
6
or
even
a
12
pack
sadly
rr
doesnt
offer
their
beers
this
way
this
one
is
really
unique
the
banana
and
citrus
peel
notes
give
it
that
classic
belgian
taste
the
dry
finish
from
the
pale
ale
style
really
gave
this
a
refreshing
finish
that
left
me
wanting
more
moreover
the
star
of
this
beer
was
the
yeast
it
flawlessly
combined
both
of
these
great
styles
into
one
wonderful
and
unique
beer
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
is
a
fan
of
the
style
its
no
duvel
but
this
is
attempt
at
a
strong
belgian
pale
a
bit
sweeter
and
less
dry
than
most
belgian
versions
but
still
quite
good
deep
into
the
flight
of
all
beers
at
the
brewery
this
is
a
excellent
golden
ale
great
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
hop
back
nice
belgian
flavor
smooth
and
consistent
beautiful
presentation
big
fluffy
head
cloudy
and
golden
very
typical
of
the
style
dry
mediumlight
bitter
finish
fruit
candy
element
in
the
aroma
and
taste
this
one
poured
a
nice
dark
golden
with
a
minimal
head
even
though
it
seems
plenty
carbonated
the
smell
is
faint
but
pleasant
with
a
light
cirtus
peppery
smell
the
taste
is
dry
and
spicy
with
a
funky
aftertaste
and
a
dry
effervescent
mouthfeel
it
has
a
champagne
feel
to
it
what
started
as
a
merely
satisfying
drink
turned
into
a
very
enjoyable
one
by
the
finish
this
is
my
first
taste
of
something
from
russian
river
and
i
must
say
that
they
live
up
to
the
hype
on
this
one
o
disappointing
but
would
be
pretty
good
if
the
sourness
didnt
ruin
it
overall
really
delicious
beer
that
i
wasnt
all
that
excited
for
since
this
is
what
i
got
when
i
passed
through
santa
rosa
but
missed
out
on
pliny
but
i
just
feel
totally
blown
away
by
it
makes
me
really
eager
to
try
some
other
strong
golden
ales
overall
a
delicious
treat
blew
away
any
expectation
i
had
went
in
not
knowing
really
what
to
expect
but
coming
away
quite
pleased
yum
opened
cold
into
a
chilled
pilsner
glass
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
haze
great
looking
beer
little
to
no

nose
consists
of
chocolate
tobacco
lemon
zest
with
a
healthy
dose
of
wet
dog
funk
up
front
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
dry
ropy
and
sticky
with
mild
carbonation
crispness
taste
is
astringency
balanced
with
malty
sweetness
and
hints
of
vanilla
citrus
fruit
tobacco
and
oak
a
very
nice
emulation
of
a
true
belgian
with
rrs
trademark
funk
in
the
mix
o
nice
beer
i
dont
drink
a
lot
in
this
style
but
its
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
in
recent
memory
this
inexplicably
sat
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
bottled
4222013
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
it
has
held
up
will
get
again
next
time
i
am
within
their
distributors
range
im
mostly
an
ipa
guy
but
this
is
a
very
pleasing
summertime
ale
the
name
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
beer
however
it
should
be
something
like
summer
shade
good
stuff
though
o
aged
well
for
a
lowish
alcohol
beer
i
wasnt
quite
sure
how
well
this
one
would
turn
out
so
i
find
myself
pleased
this
night
this
isnt
the
best
golden
strong
ale
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
a
contender
overall
this
is
a
really
well
executed
belgian
strong
ale
but
im
not
blown
away
the
flavors
seem
to
be
lacking
in
depth
and
nuance
all
other
aspects
are
near
perfect
overall
eh
its
not
bad
not
one
of
my
favorite
rr
beers
but
its
decent
had
this
beer
twice
at
monks
cafe
in
phila
maybe
it
was
the
setting
because
monks
is
one
of
the
best
bars
you
can
ever
find
but
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
great
banana
esters
some
spice
and
rounded
out
with
pleasant
yeast
character
watch
out
it
has
a
kick
if
your
a
fan
of
duvel
youll
love
this
it
poured
a
hazy
orangey
yellow
color
with
an
uneven
head
smelled
floral
with
a
bit
of
pepper
and
banana
the
taste
was
the
best
part
banana
apple
clove
pear
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
well
rounded
and
medium
bodied
great
example
of
a
strong
golden
ale
done
well
in
america
o
ages
better
than
i
expected
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
however
i
think
i
liked
it
a
little
better
fresh
this
russian
river
take
on
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
is
right
there
with
duvel
and
ommegang
i
have
one
more
in
the
cellar
to
see
if
a
longer
wait
brings
anything
different
prost
overall
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
but
it
fit
the
category
quite
well
i
would
take
the
peppery
funkiness
of
a
saison
over
the
peppery
hoppiness
of
damnation
o
4
25
not
the
best
belgian
ive
had
but
damn
good
totally
a
keeper
in
my
book
worth
trying
so
indepth
and
yet
so
drinkable
its
amazing
how
rr
can
craft
beers
like
this
simply
an
awesome
beer
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
even
non
craft
drinkers
the
fruitiness
is
insane
and
enjoyable
for
anyone
rr
has
mastered
the
sour
game
and
is
kicking
ass
in
the
belgian
ales
as
well
would
love
to
try
this
years
release
a
few
years
from
now
and
see
how
it
develops
o
beautifully
spicy
fruity
belgian
ale
really
showcases
the
yeast
the
bottle
i
got
seemed
a
little
bit
overcarbonated
the
body
and
taste
improved
the
longer
i
left
it
in
the
glass
ill
definitely
let
the
next
one
come
up
in
temp
a
little
more
next
time
before
i
pop
the
cork
o
this
is
billed
as
russian
rivers
version
of
a
duvel
on
their
website
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
higher
gravity
hefeweizen
similar
to
bells
wheat
love
that
i
had
a
few
months
ago
a
nice

makes
it

pretty
easy

refreshing
nice
flavors
but
not
so
packed
that
it
distracts
you
thumbs
up
pours
slightly
cloudy
rich
gold
in
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
smells
like
fresh
fruit
pears
citrus
golden
raisins
with
some
mild
grassy
hoppiness
the
typical
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
there
but
does
not
overpower
the
beer
the
taste
is
slightly
more
spicy
and
earthy
in
flavor
slightly
floral
and
a
bit
boozy
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
expected
fullbodied
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
slightly
less
belgian
than
expected
drinkable
and
warming
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
have
it
o
solid
beer
from
rr
very
sessionable
with
a
nice
apple
back
would
definitely
buy
again
crisp
and
refreshing
with
tasty
faint
fruit
flavor
solid
across
the
board
o
awesome
full
flavor
but
smooth
and
mellow
at
the
same
time
the
main
thing
i
wanted
out
of
this
beer
was
just
a
little
more
sour
on
the
finish
just
enough
to
finish
off
the
full
rich
flavor
a
little
cleaner
despite
that
still
an
amazingly
well
developed
flavor
profile
overall
not
as
enjoyable
as
many
of
russian
rivers
other
beers
but
solid
none
the
less
great
buy
for
4
o
complex
unique
and
a
damn
good
beer
im
looking
forward
to
reviewing
more
beers
in
the
same
style
to
see
how
it
compares
to
others
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
duvel
delirium
tremens
lulz
etc
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
one
puts
up
some
good
competition
and
has
its
own
unique
characteristics
that
make
it
stand
out
its
also
nice
that
its
one
of
the
cheaper
rr
offerings
and
i
really
appreciate
it
when
brewers
use
these
awesome
375
ml
corked
bottles
so
bonus
points
for
that
o
very
solid
a
lot
of
the
cedar
flavor
pretty
complex
mixture
of
fruit
hops
grain
and
spices
not
what
i
expected
from
a
belgian
golden
ale
but
better
the
craftsmanship
is
what
really
sells
this
beer
and
takes
it
to
the
next
level
great
stuff
cheers
overall
its
very
deserving
of
its
reputation

this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
style
by
an
american
brewery
very
well
done
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
like
it
more
than
duvel
and
a
little
less
than
delerium

its
definitely
better
as
it
warms
the
flavors
really
begin

wonderfully

overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
dry

similar
to

dry

of

and
some
hints
of
sweet

honey
strange
dry
finish
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
with
prickly
carbonation
i
really
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
there
was
something
that
seemed
off
in
the
flavor
and
perhaps
ill
have
to
try
again
some
other
time
as
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
o
this
is
a
good
beer
its
got
great
characteristics
but
as
far
as
russian
river
goes
for
me
so
far
nothing
has
stuck
out
much
the
big
rare
brews
they
have
arent
common
in
my
area
so
maybe
thats
why
im
missing
the
hype
of
rr
total
4050
overall
excellent
easily
drinkable
well
put
together
beer
in
this
style
lower
in
alcohol
and
slightly
less
harsh
then
some
other
examples
enjoyable
o
fruity
spicy
well
balanced
i
enjoyed
this
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
liked
it
you
would
think
that
with
a
name
like
damnation
it
would
be
roiling
shouting
from
the
depths
or
something
with
all
kinds
of
strong
flavors
clamoring
it
is
the
exact
opposite
of
that
its
depth
is
in
the
grain
and
how
that
sweetens
fully
and
naturally
and
without
any
sugary
quality
showing
that
the
earth
is
deep
and
golden
in
its
nature
drinks
easily
and
its
only
flaw
is
that
there
isnt
more
fruit
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
even
that
fits
the
concept
of
damnation
as
it
leaves
a
bit
of
longing
easy
and
refreshing
nothing
heavy
about
this
one
it
has
a
silky
texture
and
excellent
balance
it
sparkles
with
depth
and
complexity
rather
than
with
carbonation
and
has
a
softness
on
the
palate
that
is
tangible
all
of
the
qualities
are
only
lightly
forward
making
this
one
a
very
demure
drink
o
phenomenal
experience
i
would
possibly
put
this
american
take
on
the
belgian
style
at
the
top
spot
for
american
offerings
i
definitely
have
to
respect
the
care
and
attention
that
this
delicate
recipe
has
received
looking
forward
to
a
few
more
months
of
bottleaging
the
others
o
my
second
time
having
damnation
and
i
liked
it
much
more
the
first
time
when
i
had
it
ontap
at
the
brewery
maybe
i
should
have
aged
this
a
little
bit
longer
or
let
it
sit
out
a
bit
to
let
it
warm
and
let
some
of
the
carbon
dioxide
off
to
taste
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
nonetheless
it
is
another
good
belgianstyle
from
rrbc
worth
obtaining
a
bottle
and
cellaring
it
for
a
bit
pours
a
murky
gold
with
thick
fluffy
lasting
white
head
and
lacing
that
protrudes
from
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
of
sweet
hay
honey
wheat
and
some
light
floral
hops
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
lemon
notes
with
wheat
honey
yeast
really
smooth
drinking
golden
ale
overall
the
best
american
version
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
have
tasted
on
par
with
duvel
hell
maybe
a
slight
bit
better
if
this
were
readily
available
locally
i
would
always
have
some
on
hand
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
every
aspect
of
it
is
on
point
and
is
simply
amazing
which
each
sip
take
i
am
still
in
amazement
over
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
and
feel
o
a
gift
on
a
trade
and
this
was
a
winner
the
phenolics
are
kept
in
check
by
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
and
its
got
a
nice
dry
finish
making
it
very
drinkable
and
balanced
pours
a
bright
golden
color
into
a
tulip
glass
has
a
citrus
aroma
with
floral
undertones
you
can
smell
a
little
lemon
zest
and
yeast
taste
is
very
lite
and
crisp
like
a
saison
summer
beer
or
a
cider
rather
than
a
strong
pale
ale
you
can
barely
notice
any
of
the
alcohol
in
it
and
the
rich
flavor
completely
mask
what
ever
alcoholic
taste
there
is
it
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
the
best
belgian
pale
ive
had
to
date
granted
there
arent
many
in
my
arsenal
but
its
a
style
i
normally
avoid
drinking
something
like
this
on
a
daily
basis
could
change
my
mind
personally
its
another
win
from
my
favorite
brewery
o
incredibly
tasty
complex
brew
amazing
light
color
beautiful
appearance
lots
and
lots
of
complex
flavors
make
peace
together
and
sing
cumbaya
on
my
palate
pored
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
good
steady
streams
of
carbonation
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
and
has
an
alcoholic
fruity
smell
like
a
cider
and
a
very
slight
but
pleasant
hop
aroma
that
comes
through
right
at
the
end
really
amazing
aroma
on
this
beer
i
would
say
its
the
high
point
of
this
brew
but
honestly
its
great
all
around
moving
on
to
taste
the
spice
comes
across
on
the
palate
quite
strong
at
first
but
gives
way
to
earthy
malty
notes
almost
reminiscent
of
straw
a
very
pleasant
fruity
aftertaste
ends
the
experience
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
double
pale
ale
lots
of
interesting
stuff
going
on
in
this
beer
by
all
means
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
stumble
upon
it
and
this
seems
to
be
the
easiest
russian
river
brew
to
track
down
final
thoughts
a
good
beer
by
russian
river
and
nice
example
of
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
the
first
of
the
nonsour
ales
that
ive
tried
from
russian
rivers
line
of
belgian
style
beers
and
im
mildly
impressed
there
are
certainly
some
better
authentic
belgian
pales
out
there
then
again
id
also
choose
damnation
over
many
other
authentic
belgian
pales
too
one
of
the
best
things
about
the
brew
is
the
somewhat
low
price
point
45
a
bottle
isnt
bad
for
this
tasty
brew
overall
an
excellent
bspa
one
that
approaches
the
majesty
of
duvel
but
the
smelltaste
arent
quite
as
intoxicating
to
my
senses
given
duvels
relative
ease
of
access
and
damnations
relative
difficulty
for
me
i
cant
say
i
will
likely
try
this
one
again
soon
unfortunately
o
good
not
great
feel
like
its
a
little
uninspired
was
very
excited
and
a
tad
let
down
rr
is
great
however
they
really
have
set
their
own
bar
high
overall
i
think
this
bottle
if
from
2011
and
perhaps
it
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
still
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
i
will
have
to
track
down
a
fresh
one
it
doesnt
taste
as
refreshingvibrant
as
i
was
expecting
o
judged
on
rr
status
alone
i
can
see
why
this
is
rated
so
high
its
not
one
of
their
best
beers
but
their
best
beers
are
pretty
damn
good
my
issue
with
belgian
strong
pale
ales
is
that
im
always
comparing
them
to
the
generally
infallible
duvel
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
russian
river
however
given
how
epic
the
average
russian
river
beer
is
damnation
doesnt
really
stand
out
o
solid
but
not
lifechanging
one
of
my
least
favorite
rr
offerings
solid
for
the
style
but
loses
something
given
the
pedigree
o
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
true
to
style
and
is
complex
this
one
gets
looked
over
because
it
is
so
easy
to
find
and
made
in
abundance
still
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
relax
with
and
contemplate
another
great
from
russian
river
these
bottle
conditioned
beers
never
cease
to
impress
super
complex
and
flavorful
o
yet
another
very
solid
offering
from
russian
river
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
pleasant
but
subtlety
flavored
brew
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
7
7
certainly
worth
giving
a
try
verdict
a
very
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
from
russian
river
and
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
american
brewers
who
are
trying
to
replicate
this
style
the
balance
is
on
point
and
while
the
complexity
isnt
stunning
this
beer
hits
the
mark
a
classic
american
take
on
a
traditional
belgian
style
cheers
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
session
beer
patience
with
each
sip
was
helpful
for
me
and
rounded
out
the
experience
the
more
i
reflect
as
im
drinking
it
patience
is
perfect
for
this
beer
keeping
the
carbonation
from
making
you
feel
full
giving
it
a
94
because
i
just
think
its
better
than
a
92
and
it
carries
a
sentimental
preference
as
it
was
my
first
intro
to
rr
shout
out
to
kathy
for
sending
it
along
with
the
pliny
and
damn
you
fedex
for
breaking
one
of
them
for
the
price
under
4
and
ready
availability
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
authentic
yet
slightly
experimental
take
on
bspas
around
here
honestly
i
havent
found
a
better
deal
and
when
i
need
a
quick
fix
on
the
style
i
go
for
this
one
the
alcohol
burning
sensation
removes
a
bit
of
the
mellowness
that
i
enjoy
in
these
beers
but
luckily
the
flavor
is
very
tasty
and
juicy
as
they
should
be
recommended
a
try
to
fans
of
rr
poured
a
pale
gold
with
good
looking
head
on
top
an
of
aroma
that
has
typical
light
belgian
charateristics
such
as
touches
of
funk
some
spices
and
yeast
as
well
as
touches
of
tropical
fruit
or
at
least
apples
and
pears
and
there
is
a
candisugar
type
sweetness
underneath
it
all
lightbodied
easy
to
drink
goes
down
realy
easy
and
enjoyable
and
finishes
with
crisp
hop
bite
that
isnt
cutting
or
bitter
but
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
sweetness
so
you
keep
wanting
more
overall
the
beer
is
wellbalanced
and
while
drinking
it
i
was
not
only
getting
some
hoppiness
but
fruit
notes
from
orangey
citric
banana
to
spicy
clove
as
well
as
some
sweet
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
great
beer
and
did
not
realize
how
high
in
alcohol
because
it
does
not
bleed
into
the
beer
at
all
and
this
is
a
must
for
any
beer
snob
overall
anyway
i
enjoyed
this
offering
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
redemption
which
i
had
later
that
night
its
a
pretty
sessionable
belgian
pale
ale
that
doesnt
come
across
as
too
rich
or
strong
but
remains
incredibly
tasty
and
thirstquenching
without
filling
you
up
too
quickly
4
russian
river
puts
out
so
many
great
beers
this
seems
to
me
like
a
session
beer
there
trying
to
make
and
it
just
lacks
a
lot
overall
a
well
done
light
golden
ale
o
a
great
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
the
ale
was
a
golden
color
with
a
generous
white
head
it
left
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
a
manner
appropriate
for
the
style
in
the
aroma
one
detects
an
almost
grapelike
wine
aroma
in
the
mold
of
wine
it
projected
notes
of
a
dry
wine
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
notes
of
grape
grape
skin
wheat
dry
biscuit
yeast
and
banana
the
ale
was
smooth
yet
pleasantly
bubbly
when
the
fruits
of
the
initial
tastes
evaporate
a
dry
aftertaste
becomes
apparent
in
my
overall
impression
this
is
a
complex
beer
with
several
tastes
occurring
at
once
though
this
is
not
the
most
respected
russian
river
it
holds
up
nicely
against
other
beers
o
quaffable
strong
belgian
ale
not
to
duvel
standards
especially
when
the
price
is
considered
disappointing
for
the
price
o
overall
this
was
a
very
very
nice
beer
was
actually
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
oa
very
enjoyable
belgian
beer
they
are
not
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
defiantly
stands
out
for
me
highly
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
none
existent
in
the
taste
not
much
nose
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
huge
creamy
white
head
lacing
abound
as
the
beer
travels
down
the
glass
aromas
of
tart
apple
and
some
grass
taste
begins
with
some
tart
apple
then
some
light
grain
finishing
with
an
acidic
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
the
color
of
lemonade
with
a
dash
of
bourbon
head
disappears
quickly
with
moderate
lacing
smell
is
yeasty
grassy
the
flavor
is
malty
and
earthy
the
sweetness
is
there
too
but
only
enough
to
mask
the
alcohol
which
is
difficult
to
detect
very
high
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
style
though
a
really
nice
belgian
strong
pale
very
balanced
with
a
creaminess
to
it
on
both
the
aromas
and
feel
o
my
first
russian
river
brew
and
a
great
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
very
very
nice
beer
was
actually
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
just
returned
from
a
day
april
2013
at
the
russian
river
pub
where
i
was
delighted
to
experience
a
fresh
damnation
draft
forger
everything
i
said
before
the
fresh
draft
is
nothing
short
of
wonderful
and
a
real
flavor
experience
so
i
bought
a
case
of
mixed
bottles
including
damnation
of
course
a
few
pliny
elder
to
share
with
friends
but
the
fresh
bottled
damnation
is
splendid
my
regret
why
didnt
i
buy
2
cases
o
i
tend
to
like
big
bold
and
complex
flavors
so
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
i
was
going
to
like
this
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
vinnie
makes
amazing
beers
and
ones
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
more
than
this
one
but
i
think
this
beer
was
executed
flawlessly
if
anything
at
all
it
could
have
had
a
larger
head
really
really
good
belgian
golden
ale
not
a
style
i
normally
gravitate
towards
but
this
is
yummy
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
very
drinkable
nice
one
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
o
a
great
example
of
a
bspa
not
my
favorite
style
but
definately
one
id
enjoy
after
a
long
day
of
work
in
the
son
met
expectations
a
very
well
crafted
belgian
refreshing
and
balanced
with
crisp
light
spices
and
earthy
yeast
o
very
nice
belgian
style
ale
with
a
wonderful
champagne
like
mouthfeel
very
balanced
flavor
profile
with
some
nice
brett
character
this
most
reminded
me
of
green
flashs
rayon
vert
other
than
that
i
really
havent
had
another
beer
with
this
flavor
profile
wish
i
had
a
fresher
one
to
compare
too
but
that
will
wait
for
my
next
west
coast
trip
aged
this
does
very
well
o
great
beer
for
this
style
great
for
a
hot
day
enjoying
some
sun
refreshing
brew
that
unlike
other
rr
beers
is
quite
common
which
is
always
a
great
thing
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
nonbelgian
beer
drinkers
balance
is
great
and
drinkable
russian
river
ales
are
always
fun
and
special
because
they
are
bottled
and
presented
well
initially
the
ale
itself
poured
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
dissappated
in
mere
moments
the
color
was
of
an
apple
cider
like
tint
cloudy
and
yellow
but
almost
reddish
in
a
way
the
aroma
is
of
apple
and
cloves
but
the
taste
follows
on
the
apple
the
taste
is
more
complex
than
just
apple
as
three
distinct
stages
were
present
it
felt
as
the
first
taste
disappeared
quickly
a
new
taste
emerged
at
the
swallow
and
the
aftertaste
linger
softly
for
some
time
i
simply
could
not
describe
each
taste
and
it
seemed
i
wanted
more
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
feel
was
quite
carbonated
and
bubbly
almost
thin
overall
this
was
an
experience
and
a
good
one
at
that
o
this
is
pretty
good
not
up
there
with
beers
like
la
chouffe
but
good
pours
a
hazy
golden
apricot
with
a
solid
quilt
of
fine
light
cream
foam
smells
of
belgian
yeast
grain
bread
hints
of
tangerine
some
clay
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
flavor
has
a
clean
belgian
golden
flavor
with
plenty
grain
fruity
grapy
esters
some
banana
a
bit
of
funk
and
some
peach
body
is
heavier
than
id
prefer
with
a
decent
sharp
and
yet
soft
carb
with
an
overall
creamy
feel
nice
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
its
very
drinkable
and
the
the
abv
is
well
hidden
which
could
be
dangerous
on
a
summer
day
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
cheers
overall
very
good
very
similar
to
duvel
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
books

o
solid
belgian
ale
has
characteristics
of
a
tripel
and
is
very
enjoyable
oit
is
a
pretty
beer
with
a
pleasing
smell
but
i
felt
a
little
let
down
by
the
taste
it
came
off
a
little
too
tepid
for
me
i
mean
its
not
a
true
belgian
beer
obviously
but
it
hangs
with
the
north
american
elites
of
belgian
styles
such
as
ommegang
and
unibroue
from
russian
river
i
expect
no
less
though
frankly
it
still
surprises
me
how
good
all
of
their
beers
are
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
has
a
complex
taste
its
a
lot
easier
to
drink
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
especially
since
there
are
no
traces
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
thanks
to
my
awesome
wife
for
toting
this
one
home
from
california
on
a
business
trip
o
a
good
effort
but
all
things
being
equal
id
rather
have
a
duvel
overall
it
leaves
a
nice
twang
on
the
outsides
of
the
tongue
is
exactly
what
it
tries
to
be
and
is
an
excellent
offering
if
strong
light
belgian
ales
are
what
you
crave
it
just
doesnt
have
that
belgian
signature
and
tastes
so
much
like
the
unibroue
ales
but
very
decent
in
its
own
right
and
from
california
o
just
kind
of
meh
for
me
to
be
honest
i
expect
more
from
russian
river
just
a
fair
bspa
for
me
lots
of
better
options
from
rr
underwhelming
nose
and
flavor
profile
this
is
just
awesome
perfectly
balanced
and
excellent
its
been
a
while
since
i
added
a
beer
to
my
top
five
but
this
one
did
it
o
i
think
its
just
the
freshness
of
this
beer
i
was
getting
more
vegetal
and
hard
spice
notes
than
anything
hopefully
i
can
try
an
aged
one
at
some
point
o
id
definitely
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
i
think
ive
had
everything
in
it
was
very
well
done
from
the
appearance
down
to
the
mouthfeel
there
were
very
nice
well
balanced
flavors
that
provided
for
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
beer
not
only
that
but
beer
felt
very
good
on
the
palate
and
looked
very
good
in
the
glass
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
another
great
offering
that
i
would
highly
recommend

it

although
it
masks
the
alcohol
well
dry

wins
out
this
is
a
classic
o
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
that
much
it
isnt
bad
it
isnt
great
an
good
belgian
strong
pale
very
effervescent
this
has
loads
of
carbonation
medium
body
and
a
nice
lightly
sweet
finish
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
and
i
really
like
it
overall
the
smell
is
really
about
a
4
25
so
i
rounded
up
i
love
just
how
belgian
this
one
is
i
always
have
high
expectations
from
russian
river
and
they
are
always
met
this
is
usually
a
bad
thing
to
have
but
i
am
not
disappointed
with
this
one
overall
great
for
the
style
but
the
style
isnt
suited
for
my
tastes
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fairly
modest
head
i
did
a
slow
pour
due
to
the
bottle
fermentation
and
could
have
easily
been
aggressive
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
pepper
along
with
a
large
amount
of
fruity
flavors
the
taste
is
very
good
its
a
well
composed
belgian
ale
its
got
the
whole
bananas
pepper
and
yeast
thing
youll
expect
paired
with
crisp
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
fine
overall
its
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
the
style
still
doesnt
thrill
me
but
this
is
about
as
fine
an
example
as
im
liable
to
taste
o
i
love
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
damnation
is
a
near
perfect
example
great
flavor
and
balance
o
ive
been
damned
this
one
is
good
a
must
try
american
version
of
a
very
tasty
belgian
beer
style
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
its
sad
that
russian
river
beers
are
so
limited
in
their
distribution
they
make
wonderful
beer
my
first
russian
river
belgian
and
consider
me
impressed
cant
wait
to
open
the
rr
sours
i
have
stashed
in
the
cellar
from
this
same
trade
if
drinking
this
is
what
eternal
damnation
to
hell
holds
id
be
more
than
willing
to
go
for
the
ride

the

isnt
as
pronounced
as
the
smell
i
expected
lots
from
the
aroma
of
the
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
and
id
like
to
try
aging
this
for
a
second
chance
overall
very
good
brew
this
is
my
first
russian

beer
and
if
they
make
all
their

this

i

great
match
to
style
if
you
dont
know
what
to
expect
from
a
strong
belgian
and
just
order
this
because
of
the
cool
name
and
tshirt
it
may
be
too
much
like
my
favorite
at
the
brewerypliny
the
elder
not
the
type
of
beer
i
could
have
several
glasses
of
in
a
sitting
but
a
treat
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
great
light
body
well
carbonated
this
is
an
exceptional
golden
ale
get
it
if
you
can
i
brought
it
back
from
california
to
boston
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
bspa
good
balance
of
yeast
and
other
flavors
with
a
really
nice
finish
o
this
is
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
beeras
sessionable
as
it
gets
from
russian
river
o
this
is
my
first
introduction
to
the
russian
river
beers
and
i
was
very
impressed
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
great
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
and
only
shows
up
in
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
the
best
way
for
alcohol
to
show
up
a
terrific
example
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
if
russian
rivers
other
brews
are
anything
like
this
i
need
to
get
more
of
these
beers
had
a
friend
traveling
near
the
brewery
and
she
picked
me
up
a
few
bottles
the
beer
was
relatively
new
even
though
the
bottle
is
corked
and
made
to
age
i
was
a
little
suprised
by
the
level
of
carbination
i
thought
the
beer
had
a
nice
aroma
with
floral
and
lighter
fruit
undertones
i
could
even
pick
out
the
banana
flavors
it
was
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
despite
the
7
75abv
i
could
have
drank
the
beer
all
daya
strong
offering
from
russian
river
good
balance
in
this
beer
showing
off
really
nice
fruity
and
spicy
belgian
flavors
in
a
style
that
isnt
overly
hoppy
definitely
a
nice
earthiness
to
it
that
i
dont
find
in
a
lot
of
belgian
style
beers
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
the
flavor
is
also
super
yeasty
it
has
a
sharp
phenolic
character
and
some
vegetal
flavors
at
first
sip
but
then
it
mellows
out
it
is
spicy
with
a
decent
malt
baking
that
adds
some
basic
honeysugar
flavors
it
is
fruity
like
the
smell
mostly
banana
and
citrus
o
a
real
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
often
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pleasant
and
tasty
if
not
amazing
overall
the
website
says
that
damnation
was
inspired
by
duvel
i
have
to
say
it
beats
the
crap
out
of
duvel
and
is
much
more
rich
complex
and
full
bodied
that
said
it
just
isnt
my
style
so
i
am
sure
i
am
not
appreciating
it
as
much
as
some
others
will
a
well
done
example
of
the
style
but
ill
take
pliny
or
blind
pig
any
day
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
fairly
high
prickly
carbonation
perhaps
the
only
point
where
this
beer
actually
stumbles
a
bit
but
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
still
alright
particularly
after
a
bit
of
time
elapses
an
the
carbonation
decreases
i
liked
damnation
a
lot
nice
and
crisp
the
sweet
aftertaste
really
had
me
coming
back
for
more
pretty
fast
thanks

in
my
glass
aroma
citrusy
astringent
grainy
spicy
with
hints
of
banana
as
well
the
taste
is
very
nice
im
picking
up
a
fruity
pear
taste
thats
dominant
yet
something
i
did
not
detect
in
the
aroma
its
got
yeastyspicy
elements
to
the
taste
as
well
with
a
clean
semidry
finish
medium
bodied
and
decent
coating
of
the
palate
going
on
although
it
warms
on
the
way
down
the
alcohol
presence
goes
very
much
unnoticed
overall
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
as
this
is
russian
river
were
talking
about
maybe
i
will
try
this
again
on
the
chance
that
the
cork
loosened
and
let
some
air
in
before
purchase
this
was
very
expensive
though
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
its
just
not
one
i
get
that
excited
about
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
beers
but
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
believe
the
strong
fruit
and
low
hop
presence
makes
this
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
would
drink
it
again
0
was
good
but
for
the
price
not
one
for
me
to
buy
very
often
i
have
to
compare
this
beer
to
duvel
as
any
reasonable
person
would
rather
than
attempt
to
emulate
the
famous
belgian
beer
rr
seems
to
have
gone
their
own
way
with
this
style
successfully
it
lacks
the
crisp
stony
dryness
of
duvel
but
makes
up
for
it
with
a
delightful
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
its
an
excellent
beer
and
fans
of
duvel
should
give
it
a
try
just
dont
expect
a
clone
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
pretty
nice
overall
this
might
not
quite
be
a
duvel
but
its
a
pretty
solid
bspa
this
is
a
perfect
relaxing
beer
and
i
can
honestly
see
drinking
this
regularly
if
it
were
available
here
a
nice
abv
for
a
very
light
tasting
and
feeling
beer
hazy
deep
gold
with
some
yeasties
in
it
minimal
head
retention
and
low
carbonation
from
the
looks
of
it
aroma
is
slightly
sour
earthy
sweet
estery
a
bit
of
cloves
and
vanilla
taste
is
full
and
sweet
but
cut
by
a
slightly
tart
edge
with
lots
of
yeast
esters
fairly
full
body
with
a
creamy
finish
i
almost
wonder
whether
this
batch
didnt
carbonate
fullyproperly
its
a
tasty
beer
but
seems
like
higher
carbonation
would
do
good
things
for
it
overall
still
very
good
and
worth
trying

finish
was

this
increased
as
the

warmed
pleasant

not
really
in

of

and
the
finish
is
lacking

overall
an
exquisite
belgian
ale
with
a
complexity
of
flavors
blending
together
extremely
well
forming
a
fantastic
tasting
brew
the
medium

really
allows
the
flavors
to
strike

never
becomes
coating
or

the

fizzes

makes
a

wich

a
great
beer
for
the
style
wich
i
expected
from
rrsomewhat
refreshing
even
with
a
higher
abv
o
the
appearance
is
so
nice
but
everything
else
is
lacking
from
true
greatness
this
beer
was
so
light
and
tasty
that
i
could
drink
it
all
day
o
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
picked
this
up
during
a
recent
trip
to
ca
and
im
glad
i
did
o
damnation
is
one
of
the
best
strong
pale
ales
ive
had
its
extremely
well
done
and
complex
without
being
overwhelming
it
may
not
blow
you
away
at
first
but
as
you
drink
it
you
realize
that
this
is
beer
made
at
the
pinnacle
of
ones
craft
highly
highly
recommended
this
is
a
helluva
good
beer
about
as
close
to
a
real
belgian
as
ive
head
wish
i
had
more
than
one
overall
if
you
enjoy
the
begian
golden
ale
style
you
should
enjoy
this
offering
from
russian
river
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
tasted
anything
below
average
from
this
brewery
i
have
a
few
more
around
and
look
forward
to
drinking
them
o
solid
drinkable
though
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
rrs
other
beers
this
isnt
quite
my
style
but
i
like
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
thumbs
width
head
a
mild
but
smooth
aroma
of
some
yeast
pepper
maybe
a
little
floral
and
fruity
flavor
is
pretty
subdued
as
well
a
little
bready
some
pepper
some
fruit
and
a
hint
of
hops
you
kind
of
have
to
look
for
the
flavor
it
definitely
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
it
works
though
because
its
nice
and
balanced
light
to
medium
body
some
carbonation
a
nice
feel
to
this
overall
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
give
another
round
or
two
as
i
think
there
is
more
to
discover
with
this
one
o
a
delicious
beer
but
not
overly
complex
but
a
damn
good
brew
not
sure
how
the
aging
had
on
it
but
was
still
quite
tastey
recomend
for
beginning
belgian
drinkers
o
wow
i
love
this
beer
it
is
wonderfully
made
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
has
the
chance
o
a
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
i
like
the
funky
fruity
belgian
yeast
could
use
a
little
more
heft
in
the
malt
department
for
my
taste
but
would
be
glad
to
have
this
one
again
o
i
have
always
liked
damnation
although
i
enjoy
it
more
ontap
than
in
the
bottle
the
flavors
are
good
and
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
rr
beer
but
still
a
solid
offering
to
make
a
possibly
stupid
analogy
this
isnt
the
artist
whose
work
steals
the
show
and
towers
above
everyone
but
rather
the
kind
of
thing
youd
expect
from
any
artist
in
a
wellestablished
healthy
active
culture
of
artists
its
a
genre
work
that
makes
me
think
about
what
it
would
be
like
if
all
the
people
creating
generic
work
were
brilliantly
talented
hopefully
this
makes
at
least
a
little
sense

poured
from
a
375ml
bottle
into
a
koningshoeven
chalice
even
less
remarkable
than
previous
incarnations
if
you
want
something
like
this
go
with
the
superlative
redemption
o
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
but
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
probably
will
not
have
again
but
definitly
worth
a
try
o
a
very
solid
strong
pale
ale
the
abv
was
non
existent
and
the
combination
of
flavors
was
solid
special
no
good
yes
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
not
transparent
murky
looking
lots
of
belgian
yeast
on
the
nose
some
slight
biscuit
and
floral
scents
mixed
in
taste
starts
sweet
and
malty
ends
with
a
bit
of
a
mild
hoppy
bite
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
in
an
overwhelming
way
the
carbonation
is
really
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
goes
down
fairly
smooth
has
a
very
slight
smoky
feel
to
it
overall
i
feel
like
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
pretty
complex
on
this
beer
quite
enjoyable
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
another
one
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
but
no
other
complaints
have
had
this
on
tap
and
found
it
enjoyable
but
i
may
have
preferred
it
conditioned
in
the
bottle
a
little
bit
more
again
russian
river
doesnt
wow
me
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
by
them
id
rather
just
pay
a
little
more
and
pick
up
a
stubby
bottle
of
duvel
worthy
of
a
try
if
digging
into
strong
belgian
pales
though
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
reviewed
on
03272011
014550
o
overall
i
consider
this
one
a
miss
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
batch
but
my
assumption
is
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
because
its
a
russian
river
product
now
dont
get
me
wrong
rr
makes
some
fantastic
brews
however
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
not
in
the
same
league
as
duvel
hell
its
not
even
playing
the
same
game
and
delerium
tremens
remains
my
favorite
in
the
style
cannot
recommend
and
wont
buy
again
o
this
beer
is
my
go
to
beer
of
its
style
i
like
belgium
beers
but
some
are
too
intense
for
my
pallet
and
are
often
only
sold
in
larger
bottles
this
beer
is
always
available
at
my
work
and
i
enjoy
its
drinkability
doa
russian
river
is
a
brewery
that
remains
head
and
shoulders
above
all
comparable
examples
i
liked
the
beer
none
the
less
it
was
quite
good
o
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
but
i
paid
way
too
much
thin
quickly
vanishing
head
doesnt
have
the
most
appealing
appearance
to
me
like
another
review
said
looks
like
piss
fruity
apricot
aroma
with
dirty
funk
smells
belgian
tastes
belgian
not
my
favorite
style
but
an
easy
drink
and
has
a
nice
fruity
spicy
taste
is
that
clove
in
there
im
not
the
best
at
picking
out
spices
ill
have
this
again
i
bought
two
bottles
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
had
redemption
after
this
and
actually
preferred
it
more
i
brought
this
to
a
beer
tasting
and
poured
it
around
golden
in
color
as
some
website
have
it
listed
ads
a
stong
golden
ale
ba
has
it
listed
as
a
belgian
stong
pale
ale
yep
it
was
stong
rolling
in
at
above
7
not
bitter
at
all
not
really
like
any
beer
ive
tasted
very
flavorful
with
floral
undertones
and
sweet
i
love
belgians
so
i
loved
this
one
but
it
was
uncharacteristic
of
anything
else
ive
tasted
oa
very
great
example
of
a
belgian
style
brewed
in
america
however
it
is
still
clearly
brewed
in
america
and
not
belgium
its
missing
a
certain
raw
aspect
that
the
belgian
ales
have
it
also
doesnt
seem
to
hold
up
to
well
the
carbonation
really
bothered
me
with
this
one
also
pours
a
cloudy
straw
golden
color
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
heavy
on
belgian
yeast
spice
pepper
and
mild
fruit
sweetness
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
spicy
belgian
yeast
throughout
the
palate
mildly
hoppy
in
the
finish
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
if
mildly
boring
golden
belgian
medium
bodied
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
my
favorite
russian
river
brew
great
for
any
session
despite
being
less
known
than
other
russian
river
beers
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
is
constantly
easy
to
find
in
denver
i
drank
this
out
of
my
new
belgium
tulip
glass
and
while
not
exactly
an
ideal
beer
still
proves
that
russian
river
can
brew
just
about
anything
damn
well
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
in
denver
but
bottle
will
do
for
now
russian
river
damnation
is
a
very
clear
golden
beer
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
like
banana
bread
and
clove
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
and
a
dry
finish
it
tastes
like
cloves
and
must
almost
like
gewerztraminer
its
sweet
and
fruity
toward
the
end
with
a
note
of
pear
the
aftertaste
is
musty
and
phenolic
this
is
a
solid
and
well
done
beer
its
very
spicy
enjoyable
beer
highly
drinkable
with
a
few
exceptions
there
are
not
many
bspas
that
i
have
the
urge
to
drink
often
if
this
were
readily
available
to
me
i
would
certainly
purchase
it
a
few
times
a
year
o
perfect
score
from
me
this
beer
is
not
letting
me
down
even
in
the
slightest
if
this
is
what
californians
are
treated
with
daily
im
jealous
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
domestic
belgianstyled
spa
and
to
my
palate
within
spitting
distance
of
the
genuine
article
given
it
blind
i
might
have
even
mistaken
it
as
having
come
directly
from
belgium
very
much
a
belgianstyle
ale
very
strong
alcohol
taste
and
wheat
well
carbonated
this
beer
encroaches
on
being
too
over
the
top
with
wheat
and
strength
but
doesnt
go
over
the
line
very
well
done
i
can
see
how
it
could
go
wrong
if
the
bottle
is
not
kept
in
optimal
conditions
but
when
at
its
best
this
is
a
fine
offering
had
this
without
reading
bottle
and
thought
it
was
same
style
bpa
abbey
style
single
as
redemption
but
this
aint
a
bpa
comes
on
like
a
tripel
for
sure
as
a
bpa
its
way
out
of
style
in
many
ways
as
a
tripel
it
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
many
others
easily
available
as
a
bspa
it
is
really
good
but
not
great
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
fairly
minor
head
and
distinctive
belgian
aroma
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
decent
but
never
enough
hop
profile
big
beers
are
not
the
best
choice
when
you
have
to
return
to
work
though
yum
i
let
this
bottle
warm
a
bit
first
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
medium
sized
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
settled
and
some
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
loads
of
medium
size
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
caramel
malt
hop
flavor
is
much
like
nose
but
amplified
vineous
great
interplay
between
bitter
sweet
and
carbonic
tang
body
and
carbonaton
are
just
perfect
very
well
balanced
in
all
regrards
finish
tends
towards
more
bitter
than
sweet
and
leaves
me
wishing
for
another
sip
masterful
beer
a
decent
enough
ode
to
the
belgian
style
its
just
with
all
the
hype
id
rather
have
a
6
dollar
bomber
of
unibroue
vs
a
6
dollar
bottle
of
this
which
entails
a
long
trip
across
the
border
at
that
situational
ya
know
first
russian
river
brew
batch
number
65
poured
a
uniformly
hazy
golden
wheat
color
with
a
large
but
delicate
white
head
into
a
wine
glass
classy
packaging
and
mercurial
carbonation
makes
this
beer
look
exquisite
the
nose
is
telling
me
its
a
nice
belgian
but
not
much
more
than
that
the
taste
is
sharp
and
white
wine
like
with
a
gentle
display
of
hops
a
slightly
floral
and
patient
finish
tops
it
off
and
a
little
sweetness
probably
from
the
bottling
sugars
left
over
the
mouthfeel
here
is
divine
bubbly
and
yeasty
and
fuller
bodied
than
the
style
usually
delivers
this
is
a
damn
fine
glass
of
ale
and
i
look
forward
to
my
next
russian
river
brew
o
i
think
this
is
up
with
duvel
as
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ales
i
think
damnation
has
more
juicy
citrus
than
duvel
but
both
are
excellent
o
wonderful
lively
and
light
tastes
great
mouthfeeloverall
light
mouthfeel
again
the
carbonation
seems
low
not
bad
though
overall
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
may
have
been
an
off
bottle
o
a
good
belgian
strong
the
yeast
character
is
good
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
little
more
complexity
would
have
been
nice
on
a
positive
note
the
7
75
abv
is
very
well
hidden
o
excellent
brew
very
tasty
and
great
depth
o
just
a
real
nice
refreshing
and
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
good
mouthfeel
nothing
that
knocks
you
overthehead
but
everything
is
so
nicely
proportioned
i
liked
it
better
here
ontap
than
when
i
had
it
in
the
bottle
the
is
very
well
balanced
mellow
and
smooth
with
a
nice
spiciness
as
youd
expect
from
the
nose
overall
its
way
better
than
the
bottles
ice
had
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
not
bad
o
great
bspa
i
dont
like
many
of
them
but
this
one
is
quickly
among
my
favorites
o
for
style
i
dont
love
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
very
subtle
flavors
and
extremely
easy
drinking

poured
into
a
maudite
goblet
this
beer
is
a
bright
golden
color
with
white
head
that
oh
so
slowly
settles
the
aroma
is
not
overly
strong
but
getting
some
peach
pear
and
a
light
banana
along
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
somewhat
simple
but
in
a
good
way
you
get
the
belgian
yeast
gum
like
flavor
then
some
sweet
fruits
and
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
it
has
a
light
dry
finish
that
pretty
much
begs
you
to
take
another
sip
the
alc
is
very
hidden
this
was
very
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
pours
a
yellowgolden
color
id
hate
to
say
this
but
it
reminds
me
of
budweiser
or
pbr
no
points
knocked
for
this
though
has
a
halfinch
of
white
head
no
retention
and
no
lacing
this
smells
of
belgian
yeast
spices
and
the
ocean
for
some
reason
belgian
ales
always
remind
me
of
the
ocean
the
taste
is
spicy
up
front
and
out
back
leaves
a
tingling
sensation
in
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
really
good
on
this
one
pretty
effervescent
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
decent
representation
of
this
style
nothing
overly
special
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
overall
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
rr
this
is
no
exception
but
its
below
their
usual
standards
i
cant
find
any
reason
to
say
any
category
is
less
than
good
but
i
cant
find
a
reason
to
say
its
any
better
than
good

unlike
unibroques
alcohol
is
masked
well
o
good
for
the
style
yet
it
doesnt
stand
out
enough
still
very
satisfactory
defiantly
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
nice
well
balanced
bspa
lots
of
flavor
and
nice
representation
of
the
style
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
as
directed
by
the
bottle
pours
golden
straw
color
with
white
foam
that
sticks
around
smells
floral
with
light
citrus
very
good
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
but
not
fizzy
taste
is
an
elegant
belgian
ale
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
but
wanted
to
try
a
rrbc
beer
this
was
the
only
one
i
could
find
i
this
area
and
it
didnt
disappoint
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
wheat
and
some
citrus
flood
the
nose
on
the
beer
the
taste
of
the
brew
has
some
interesting
floral
and
fruity
flavors
going
on
in
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
silky
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
feel
this
brew
it
quite
impressive
much
like
everything
from
russian
river
i
like
that
this
one
isnt
a
sour
because
everyone
just
raves
about
their
sours
so
much
this
one
is
really
good
and
its
something
a
little
different
from
them
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
think
fluffy
head
that
refuses
to
go
away
great
lacing
throughout
the
drink
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
that
are
both
present
but
working
together
taste
follows
the
nose
makes
for
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
brew
tastes
a
lot
like
redemption
but
more
full
bodied
and
complex
o
overall
very
nice
a
somewhat
lighter
flavor
but
still
quite
interesting
another
beer
that
seems
to
come
off
as
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
like
it
just
happened
o
overall
a
great
brew
not
to
heavy
not
to
light
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
belgian
beers
however
this
might
have
been
what
i
needed
to
go
over
the
top
cant
wait
to
try
rrbcs
other
belgians
stay
thirsty
my
friends
i
really
like
the
carbonation
in
this
one
just
thick
enough
with
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
beer
but
im
really
enjoying
it
i
wont
go
out
looking
for
it
but
if
i
found
it
in
the
fridge
i
would
be
pleasantly
surprised
o
solid
version
of
the
classic
belgian
pale
where
the
pale
malts
really
dominate
but
the
yeast
adds
just
the
right
blend
of
authenticity
and
breadiness
notes
a
little
too
strong
on
the
bready
malty
flavor
compared
to
the
fruity
and
yeasty
flavors
its
a
good
and
tasty
beer
but
not
a
go
to
beer
for
either
the
style
or
the
brewery
overall
experience
with
so
many
other
golden
ales
to
grab
i
am
not
sure
this
would
be
my
go
to
golden
ale
i
did
however
enjoy
the
bitter
dryness
that
it
possessed
a
west
coast
hop
character
that
fits
well
and
a
mouth
feel
that
would
throw
anyone
for
a
loop
these
characteristics
however
make
it
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
dinner
with
friends
bottle
of
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
rr
tulip
the
color
is
a
faint
yellow
with
a
slight
orange
tinge
with
just
a
faint
head
with
faint
lacing
very
effervescent
and
bubbly
faint
taste
of
tobacco
with
a
nice
tartness
taste
of
green
apple
crisp
and
clean
taste
not
my
favorite
tion
but
glad
to
try
it
lacks
a
little
bit
of
oomph
for
my
taste
solid
beer
will
not
seek
out
a
crisp
belgian
golden
ale
but
for
me
the
bitterness
cuts
through
just
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
a
very
pleasant
beer
this
is
my
introduction
to
tasting
russian
river
and
i
hope
it
is
not
the
last
they
have
a
flair
for
belgians
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
from
what
ive
heard
of
it
i
tried
it
as
my
second
beer
of
the
night
and
i
just
thought
it
was
good
but
nothing
special
ehh
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the
belgian
originals
o
not
sure
if
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
but
it
is
really
good
and
more
then
anything
extremely
unique
i
just
dont
think
my
palate
was
ready
for
all
that
flavor
will
definitely
revisit
this
in
a
few
months
overall
really
enjyed
this
beer
from
russian
river
its
delicate
and
complex
yet
another
great
belgian
style
ale
by
russian
river
over
all
a
very
nice
middle
of
the
road
belgian
ale
oa
wellbalanced
beer
a
good
accompaniement
to
food
the
rest
great
balance
and
an
awesome
mouthfeel
make
this
a
really
enjoyable
beer
other
than
a
slight
medicinal
note
in
the
nose
its
not
hot
at
all
for
being
almost
8
another
winner
from
russian
river
skål
o
good
beer
would
definitely
have
again
not
as
intense
as
some
of
its
other
ation
brethren
form
russian
river
overall
a
decent
beer
but
ive
had
better
from
this
style
i
suppose
its
only
natural
that
i
compare
this
to
duvel
as
its
an
archetype
of
the
style
and
well
i
drank
this
from
a
duvel
tulip
on
the
basis
of
that
comparison
this
falls
short
but
overall
this
is
a
fine
if
unspectacular
russian
river
offering
nice
not
must
have
o
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
that
can
hold
its
own
against
any
other
bspa
the
taste
was
great
fresh
on
this
one
again
all
i
can
really
say
is
how
crisp
and
clean
this
is
never
a
favorite
style
of
mine
damnation
is
certainly
a
favorite
within
the
style
so
cool
to
have
tried
this
fresh
i
really
want
one
of
those
growlers
now
o
quality
brew
from
rr
but
far
from
my
favorite
offering
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
head
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
floral
aroma
with
some
estery
notes
from
the
yeast
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
as
well
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
very
nice
balance
between
acidity
and
sweetness
in
fact
that
balance
to
me
is
what
makes
this
beer
a
success
some
beers
of
this
style
can
get
a
bit
sweet
also
there
might
be
a
bit
more
hops
than
you
would
find
in
a
traditional
belgian
beer
but
thats
just
fine
by
me
overall
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
one
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
had
more
access
to
it
o
a
good
typical
belgian
pale
that
is
quite
refreshing
and
does
what
i
believe
it
was
intended
to
do
great
drinkability
and
overall
a
great
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
golden
color
off
white
fizzy
head
retains
very
well
and
lacing
is
evident
on
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
belgian
yeast
citrus
candy
sugar
mild
floral
notes
in
the
flavor
a
nice
balance
of
yeast
fruityness
bubblegum
citrus
hops
and
pale
malts
alittle
belgian
yeast
spiciness
lingers
on
the
palate
hint
of
apple
skin
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
a
damn
fine
belgian
pale
ale
almost
bordering
into
tripel
territory
in
either
case
a
nice
belgian
golden
ale
batch
054
another
unnecessary
though
greatly
appreciated
extra
bottle
at
the
tasting
right
on
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
lemon
zest
light
coriander
and
a
tough
of
belgian
yeast
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
lemon
zest
orange
rind
lime
zest
and
a
very
light
touch
of
caramel
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
fairly
solid
bspa
but
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
its
good
but
it
doesnt
bring
anything
special
to
the
table
bit
of
a
disappointment
if
you
ask
me
and
clearly
you
did
i
paired
this
beer
with
some
lightly
barbequed
jerk
chicken
and
it
went
extremely
well
enhancing
a
lot
of
the
spices
in
both
the
beer
and
food
the
calming
bready
and
yeasty
qualities
were
great
and
even
on
its
own
this
is
a
very
solid
demonstration
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
refreshing
and
interesting
but
with
all
i
had
hear
about
rrbc
i
had
hoped
for
more
onot
my
favorite
by
russian
river
but
definitely
a
quality
brew
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
close
to
8
abv
beer
pours
a
light
amber
14
white
head
nose
is
fruit
and
spice
taste
is
much
the
same
fruit
and
spice
however
there
seems
to
be
a
battle
between
bitter
and
sweet
which
throws
me
off
a
little
bit
oversweet
up
front
mildly
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
heavily
carbonated
o
not
as
impressive
as
redemption
which
was
the
other
beer
from
their
belgian
line
that
i
had
but
nonetheless
a
good
solid
beer
ogreat
beer
and
the
price
is
right
too
ill
drop
one
in
the
cellar
and
see
what
it
does
in
a
few
years
m
medium
body
medium
carbonation
o
excellent
american
brewed
belgian
strong
pale
ale
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
brew
that
pairs
well
with
food
light
to
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
a
nice
dose
of
carbonation
make
for
an
inviting
mouthfeel
it
is
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
certainly
something
id
drink
again
another
nice
offering
from
russian
river
o
a
very
tasty
beer
in
a
beautiful
bottle
and
for
half
the
price
of
either
consecration
or
supplication
this
beer
is
the
best
taste
for
the
best
value
that
i
have
seen
from
russian
river
a
real
winner
o
very
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
however
not
at
all
special
corking
this
was
wasteful
another
solid
showing
by
rr
nose
and
taste
is
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
everything
is
balanced
and
works
well
together
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
like
today
for
the
style
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
o
pretty
good
bspa
the
peppery
presence
kinda
threw
me
off
it
was
a
nice
surprise
another
good
beer
by
rr
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
would
have
liked
the
flavor
to
linger
more
between
each
sip
yet
this
is
still
a
fine
ale
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
belgian
and
quite
mild
given
the
abv
quite
well
balanced
and
ill
have
another
when
given
the
chance
overall
a
nice
brew
not
extreme
or
off
the
wall
and
would
go
great
with
pasta
final
thought
at
4
a
bottle
and
a
nice
7
abv
you
have
to
try
this
one
and
maybe
age
another
doverall
this
brew
was
good
very
drinkable
and
the
flavors
came
together
nicely
rr
has
alot
of
other
brews
in
this
style
i
would
pick
before
this
one
but
cant
complain
its
a
good
brew
imho
i
like
this
better
than
duvel
it
goes
down
smoother
and
seems
more
complex
well
done
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
beers
i
popped
the
cork
on
damnation
and
poured
it
into
my
glass
and
felt
happy
though
being
damned
i
really
liked
the
fuzzy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
nice
and
pearly
white
i
first
put
it
to
my
nose
and
inhaled
pleasantly
surprised
light
and
citrusy
with
a
definite
hint
of
banana
and
just
a
speck
of
spice
very
pleasing
upon
tasting
again
was
quite
pleased
has
a
very
light
feel
in
the
mouth
mild
carbonation
nice
linger
that
gets
all
the
taste
to
the
senses
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
heavily
the
taste
comes
across
like
the
smell
citrus
notes
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
back
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
but
very
good
overall
i
really
like
damnation
and
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
been
in
the
bottle
for
nearly
a
year
according
to
the
rr
website
really
a
nice
treat
hope
to
find
again
was
bored
last
night
so
i
went
to
apex
in
portland
with
7
dollars
in
my
pocket
was
more
than
surprised
to
see
12
oz
pours
for
3
50
got
two
i
love
this
beer
if
i
was
someone
looking
to
start
drinking
belgians
this
is
the
best
tasting
around
i
normally
like
bottle
conditioned
beers
better
but
this
was
outstanding
it
looked
good
from
the
start
it
smelled
great
not
too
much
funkiness
and
slight
spice
notes
present
really
makes
me
want
to
drink
instead
of
regret
like
some
belgians
the
taste
is
amazing
nice
sweet
tones
with
a
touch
of
spice
that
is
expected
but
not
too
strong
the
good
mouthfeel
really
helped
this
quench
my
thirst
on
a
warm
summer
night
amazing
beer
with
the
high
abv
it
is
not
present
at
all
it
almost
made
me
wonder
if
russian
river
is
accurate
with
their
calculations
nevertheless
this
is
a
beer
to
have
bottled
or
on
draft
and
normally
i
designate
one
or
the
other
but
never
both
exceptional
experience
and
most
likely
will
go
back
for
more
this
week
only
my
second
beer
from
russian
river
liked
them
both
so
far
this
is
rrs
belgian
offering
its
got
that
belgian
flavor
immediately
its
tripely
but
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
many
tripels
seem
to
be
the
citrus
probably
helped
knock
that
down
a
bit
its
certainly
the
best
american
belgian
style
ive
had
beating
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
which
was
not
an
easy
feat
it
was
amazingly
drinkable
for
its
high
abv
murky
straw
colored
pour
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
with
banana
clove
and
a
light
citrus
nose
the
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
and
citrus
notes
to
it
the
hops
come
through
in
the
end
of
the
taste
and
make
it
very
refreshing
the
beer
is
mediumtohigh
carbonation
which
is
what
i
expect
with
this
style
of
beer
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
alcohol

wonderful
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
pretty
moderate
for
the
style
overall
it
was
an
excellent
beer
very
nice
flavors
and
also
well
balanced
probably
the
best
version
of
the
style
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
very
nice
overall
overall
a
really
nice
and
pleasant
belgian
style
golden
ale
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
the
funk
develops
over
time
but
it
drinks
well
as
a
refreshing
golden
ale
now
balanced
and
suitably
complex
o
very
tasty
hides
the
7
75
alcholol
well
it
went
down
smooth
and
quickly
o
very
refreshing
drinking
experience
solid
golden
ale
very
smooth
easy
drinkability
just
a
solid
example
of
a
belgium
style
beer
nice
and
complex
o
overall
a
solid
bspa
a
little
sweeter
wouldve
made
it
perfect
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
the
further
i
got
into
this
beer
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
very
tasty
and
smooth
with
lots
of
complexity
and
balance
this
was
the
first
rr
beer
other
than
pte
that
ive
tried
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
for
its
style
its
pretty
damn
tops
i
highly
recommend
this
one
another
legit
us
made
belgian
beer
the
look
is
golden
with
a
soda
pop
head
that
slowly
disappates
to
a
quarter
inch
layer
of
head
that
retains
through
the
whole
drink
lacing
is
very
good
the
smell
is
pleasantly
yeasty
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
with
honey
mild
lemon
vanilla
and
bread
really
drinkable
damn
i
wish
they
had
this
in
chicago
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
was
initially
worried
that
this
bottle
might
be
undercarbonated
based
on
the
strange
lack
of
head
but
as
it
turned
out
it
was
very
well
carbonated
i
cant
explain
the
lack
of
foam
as
this
sort
of
beer
is
usually
capped
by
a
tenacious
head
of
sticky
suds
especially
in
bottle
conditioned
versions
aside
from
the
foam
issues
everything
else
shapes
up
nicely
there
is
some
of
the
obligatory
fruity
yeast
character
present
but
the
emphasis
is
really
on
the
soft
bready
malt
and
the
intense
spicy
hop
profile
this
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
most
successful
belgain
strong
golden
ales
that
i
have
had
which
tend
to
emphasize
bright
fruit
notes
and
yeasty
spice
along
side
the
hops
and
malt
it
works
fairly
well
here
but
i
feel
like
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
with
a
stronger
yeast
profile
to
fill
things
out
pretty
nice
and
reasonably
priced
for
something
from
rr
but
i
still
prefer
classics
like
la
chouffe
to
this
one
overall
this
is
a
really
great
american
rendition
of
a
belgian
style
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
come
across
not
quite
world
class
but
flavorful
and
exceedingly
drinkable
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
russian
river
beers
it
is
reasonably
priced
and
is
so
solid
in
all
aspects
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
brewi
really
enjoyed
if
you
enjoy
belgian
style
ales
then
this
is
a
nice
brew
to
seek
out
o
light
and
refreshing
yet
complex
and
delicious
a
perfect
take
on
this
style
finish
long
and
and
some
what
dry
it
really
finishes
complex
and
layered
with
plenty
of
flavor
oa
great
beer
light
and
refreshing
but
with
enough
hop
backbone
and
great
clove
flavors
this
particular
bottle
didnt
have
much
head
or
any
lasting
lacing
which
is
why
i
dropped
the
appearance
score
slightly
very
dry
with
a
prominent
white
pepper
component
that
leads
to
a
tart
and
crisp
delivery
of
flavor
finishes
with
some
acid
but
the
tart
notes
and
high
carbonation
scrub
the
palate
fairly
well
body
is
fairly
in
the
medium
range
surprisingly
full
for
the
acidity
this
is
a
strong
entry
into
a
style
loaded
with
heavyweights
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
when
it
is
90
degrees
outside
it
was
highly
effervescent
and
very
refreshing
i
prefer
duvel
over
this
variation
of
a
strong
golden
ale
but
how
can
one
bead
perfection
in
that
category
overall
it
was
a
fantastic
bottle
that
i
will
seek
out
again
good
spices
in
this
beer
surprising
beer
from
this
very
good
brewer
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
that
is
not
reflected
in
my
ratings
my
ratings
reflect
the
solid
craftsmanship
this
brew
presents
giant
frothy
head
that
takes
several
mminutes
to
subside
smells
pretty
good
nice
and
light
taste
is
very
good
for
the
category
nice
and
light
and
bubbly
amost
champagne
like
everything
is
on
point
with
thsi
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
less
shitty
than
a
lot
of
blondes
i
have
had
clean
and
crisp
so
if
you
like
the
style
give
it
a
go
this
will
most
likely
be
my
first
and
last
of
these
until
my
roving
freaking
palate
changes
again
a
fine
drink
for
the
style
overall
nice
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
i
see
this
beer
as
either
a
nice
abv
session
beer
or
an
entry
level
micro
that
packs
a
punch
for
beginners
keep
in
mind
i
am
a
hop
head
and
love
flavors
and
bourbon
barrels
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
captures
the
essence
of
a
belgian
beer
yet
still
has
enough
complexity
in
the
finish
to
make
it
stand
out
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
so
used
to
having
this
on
tap
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
from
the
bottle
oi
really
like
it
and
would
get
it
all
the
time
if
i
lived
in
california
but
here
on
the
east
coast
there
are
some
substitutes
that
are
worthy
enough
for
me
pristine
golden
now
with
very
litle
head
aroma
similar
to
above
with
a
slightly
pinier
aroma
much
less
carbonated
than
batch
22
which
makes
the
mouthfeel
less
lively
sweeter
and
in
general
not
as
good
ratings
based
on
batch
22
i
may
give
this
another
shot
but
i
wasnt
impressed
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
very
quick
dry
sharp
finish
as
i
said
before
its
a
bit
like
chardonnay
in
that
sense
an
experience
i
havent
had
before
with
any
beer
and
not
really
one
i
want
to
repeat
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
above
average
but
it
didnt
really
rock
me
its
mimicked
a
belgian
flavor
very
well
but
whatever
spice
is
in
here
was
a
little
offsetting
for
me
would
try
one
of
the
oak
aged
versions
though
to
see
if
it
improves
any
o
wow
this
one
is
something
special
wish
russian
river
was
available
back
home
as
this
would
be
a
brewery
i
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
havent
had
one
yet
i
didnt
love
m
d
alcohol
not
as
hidden
as
id
like
it
to
be
creamy
due
to
the
lace
smooth
the
slight
sweetness
balances
the
alcohol
almost
d
this
is
an
overall
pretty
solid
belgian
there
are
nice
spicy
notes
that
are
well
balanced
with
the
citrus
and
malts
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
for
everyone
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
overall
this
beer
goes
into
my
once
is
enough
category
not
my
favorite
style
and
the
price
was
steep
not
worth
it
drinkability
best
belgian
pale
ive
vere
had
love
it
not
a
big
fan
of
thwe
style
o
very
nice
beer
if
it
were
cheaper
id
drink
this
quite
often
much
enjoyed
overall
worth
it
for
me
to
try
out
but
i
like
the
sours
and
ipas
much
better
o
this
beer
is
a
solid
representative
for
the
style
but
its
hard
to
rate
it
against
the
best
as
much
as
i
enjoy
russian
river
i
cant
give
it
full
marks
but
its
close
onot
my
favorite
by
russian
river
but
definitely
a
quality
brew
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
close
to
8
abv
beer
o
absolutely
delicious
extremely
balanced
easy
drinking
and
a
medium
complexity
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
each
flavor
represented
d
fantastic
belgian
golden
style
ale
made
for
the
perfect
summer
day
or
the
coldest
of
winter
nights
this
is
the
most
perfect
representation
of
a
golden
from
the
u
s
excellent
drinkability
the
abv
is
well
masked
and
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
complex
enough
to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
this
but
youd
have
to
move
on
after
a
couple
due
to
the
abv
cheers
the
drink
on
this
brew
is
great
it
is
not
overbearing
by
any
means
bit
has
a
great
blend
of
flavors
that
make
it
a
great
brew
for
any
time
of
the
year
it
has
a
great
dry
finish
and
its
beautifully
clean
an
amazng
brew
by
russian
river
and
probably
one
of
the
best
represenations
of
the
style
by
an
american
brewery
o
good
beer
if
not
my
favorite
definitely
a
strongly
belgian
flavored
ale
overall
this
is
damn
fine
in
its
own
right
but
it
wouldnt
be
worth
a
trip
to
california
to
get
it
with
so
many
other
great
examples
of
the
style
available
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
the
most
drinkable
belgian
ive
ever
had
usually
with
most
others
i
enjoy
it
up
until
the
aftertaste
thats
where
the
skunked
weak
rotten
yeast
taste
comes
in
but
not
with
damnation
the
finish
remains
strong
in
the
bread
department
sweet
biscuits
and
fruity
spices
are
a
nice
change
from
that
uncomfortable
belgian
finish
i
am
used
too
but
maybe
ive
just
been
drinking
the
wrong
belgians
i
have
not
enjoyed
a
belgian
beer
this
much
since
st
bernardus
tripel
which
damnation
completely
destroys
medium
bodied
and
extraordinarily
enjoyable
i
may
have
to
ask
madvermin
to
send
me
another
of
these
in
the
near
future
mouthfeel
is
very
diverse
and
welldone
starts
creamy
and
rich
as
mentioned
earlier
almost
like
a
milkshake
then
moves
to
a
gritty
chalky
middle
and
finally
to
a
dry
bitter
end
its
a
nice
cycle
of
feels
that
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
initial
feel
is
good
but
a
bit
too
much
combined
with
the
sweetness
at
that
juncture
for
me
though
drinkability
is
solid
due
to
the
variation
in
textures
and
flavors
although
hindered
by
the
start
affordable
good
beer
from
russian
river
and
a
great
american
brewed
belgian
strong
pale
ale
had
a
great
experience
with
this
after
longmounting
anticipation
a
nice
wheaty
beer
thats
labeled
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
tastes
similar
to
a
dubbel
hoppy
mildly
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
tanginess
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
priced
at
15bottle
i
dont
know
if
ill
have
another
soon
especially
since
i
liked
the
redemption
a
good
bit
more
all
the
same
look
forward
to
having
this
again
down
the
road
its
really
all
about
the
yeast
though
that
is
the
overriding
flavor
profile
for
me
it
has
that
unique
belgian
yeast
taste
and
feel
this
would
be
a
great
racetrack
beer
or
at
a
game
i
would
liken
it
to
hennepin
and
direct
your
attention
to
cooperstown
though
this
was
certainly
not
perfect
could
have
used
better
clarity
a
stronger
aroma
and
higher
carbonation
it
was
quite
good
and
the
flavor
is
complex
and
delicious
its
also
relatively
light
on
the
palate
and
dry
which
only
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
i
could
drain
several
of
these
which
is
probably
not
a
good
thing
give
its
nearly
8
alcohol
content
bravo
russian
river
d
very
high
due
to
such
high
taste
marks
alcohol
is
a
perfect
amount
pours
a
pretty
wimpy
head
not
much
there
not
even
a
fingers
worth
the
color
on
it
is
very
nice
though
its
orange
and
cloudy
looks
like
its
one
step
away
from
being
a
belgian
wheat
beer
it
is
a
very
unique
appearance
in
some
ways
the
color
has
hints
of
white
very
interesting
if
it
werent
for
the
head
this
would
get
a
great
rating
to
its
credit
though
the
frothyness
and
bubbles
have
stayed
at
the
top
of
the
glass
where
they
were
poured
its
leaving
a
nice
foam
rim
around
the
top
of
the
glass
almost
like
huge
lacing
or
something
ill
go
ahead
and
give
this
a
4
just
because
i
know
it
deserves
it
the
smell
is
very
nice
it
smells
very
crisp
you
get
that
sour
smell
on
the
nose
but
it
is
not
offensive
at
all
in
fact
it
smells
like
it
compliments
the
beer
very
well
you
dont
get
much
other
smells
other
than
that
on
the
nose
maybe
in
the
distance
you
can
pick
up
a
little
but
of
that
beer
smell
wow
this
beer
is
bursting
with
flavor
you
get
that
sour
taste
but
like
i
said
it
is
not
overpowering
or
offensive
then
you
get
a
nice
sweetness
at
the
end
not
too
much
though
im
definitely
picking
up
hints
of
fruit
in
here
as
well
maybe
mango
tangerine
or
peach
its
hard
to
tell
there
is
also
a
nice
spice
or
herb
flavor
its
very
hidden
but
it
balances
out
the
fruity
flavor
well
not
too
much
hop
or
malt
here
you
maybe
get
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
in
the
front
end
but
not
much
at
all
overall
the
taste
is
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
good
not
amazing
but
good
drinkability
is
very
high
for
it
being
7
75
abv
they
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
in
this
beer
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
all
around
nothing
is
wrong
with
it
and
there
is
a
lot
that
is
right
with
it
are
my
socks
blown
off
no
but
its
a
solid
beer
cheers
based
on
my
prior
readings
about
this
beer
i
expected
more
from
the
flavor
its
hard
to
give
a
beer
such
a
good
overall
review
with
a
summary
that
hints
to
dissapointment
but
after
all
that
i
read
the
flavor
just
did
not
pack
the
depth
i
saught
with
all
of
that
said
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
even
7
75
it
didnt
leave
me
feeling
full
as
some
other
overly
carbonated
examples
do
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
this
in
a
750ml
bottle
instead
of
the
375ml
bottle
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
good
for
this
style
but
to
me
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
overall
a
solid
beer
that
should
be
respected
d
very
drinkable
at
a
price
7
25
according
to
their
board
d
incredibly
smooth
an
quaffable
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
just
overall
pleasant
to
consume
wish
we
had
more
here
on
the
east
coast
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
subtle
orange
tint
and
a
couple
fingers
of
light
fluffy
head
smells
of
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
both
of
which
are
prominent
in
the
first
and
every
subsequent
taste
a
medium
bodied
brew
fruity
with
little
hop
character
but
the
powerful
yeast
is
balanced
nicely
by
a
little
note
of
alcohol
at
the
end
great
lacing
all
the
way
down
which
would
have
been
a
nice
sight
at
the
end
if
it
werent
for
the
empty
glass
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
an
ideal
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
price
drinabilty
much
better
then
redemption
but
honesty
still
to
mild
very
very
drinkable
and
tasty
still
doesnt
seem
like
its
even
close
to
8
alcohol
wish
it
had
a
malt
presence
to
it
to
give
it
some
kick
not
bad
at
all
but
cant
touch
duvel
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
flavors
are
addicting
and
mesh
great
but
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
help
compensate
for
the
bone
dry
finish
d
like
its
sister
beer
redemption
this
is
one
that
could
be
drank
all
night
another
great
brew
from
rr
the
beer
smelled
of
clove
yeast
pepper
a
little
zest
and
a
malty
sweetness
the
taste
was
clean
and
pleasantly
spicy
citric
and
sweet
with
a
lightly
hoppy
bitter
and
resinous
finish
it
was
edium
mcarbonated
oily
light
and
refreshingly
easy
to
drink
poured
from
bottle
batch
23
into
snifter
glass
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
pour
with
a
lasting
rocky
white
head
aroma
is
a
little
funky
and
musty
with
lemon
banana
thyme
vinegar
and
spice
flavor
has
the
same
funky
musty
quality
but
the
fruit
notes
arent
as
prominent
with
the
herbal
spicy
notes
standing
out
more
and
with
hints
of
wood
and
sourness
light
dry
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
soft
carbonation
and
a
lingering
bitter
slightly
sour
finish
this
is
a
particularly
good
belgian
style
ale
very
faithful
to
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
with
restrained
sweetness
and
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
delicious
d
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
its
almost
unsafe
the
alcohol
is
completely
nonexistant
and
the
dry
finish
makes
sure
you
keep
coming
back
for
more
dr
id
definitely
have
it
again
especially
at
its
price
and
abv
i
find
myself
hitting
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
while
its
upside
down
to
make
sure
i
get
every
drop
youd
never
know
it
was
7
75
its
pricey
but
worht
it
for
celebration
the
cpj
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
ale
no
surprise
that
russian
river
made
another
great
beer
d
i
have
really
enjoyed
this
stateside
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
cheers
to
russian
river
mouth
is
medium
and
somewhat
slick
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
its
crazy
a
very
clean
refreshing
take
on
the
bspa
style
drinkability
the
best
belgian
i
have
had
at
the
brewhouse
tonight
id
buy
it
again
t
nice
and
crisp
with
the
yeast
again
making
up
the
body
of
the
flavor
the
only
thing
off
for
me
in
this
beer
was
the
carbonation
it
felt
like
this
beer
was
a
little
too
flat
for
me
still
a
good
beer
and
another
achievement
for
russian
river
d
reasonably
good
im
not
an
avid
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
well
done
by
russian
river
crisp
and
bright
up
front
but
then
quickly
fading
to
matted
numbing
tartness
and
chalky
yeast
on
the
palate
the
fine
bubbles
then
fizzle
up
a
bit
at
the
end
and
brighten
up
the
lingering
sourness
characteristic
of
many
rr
brews
the
mouthfeel
really
steals
the
show
and
makes
all
the
difference
in
accentuating
the
best
attributes
of
this
brew
a
balances
mellow
yet
complex
beer
makes
for
high
drinkability
in
my
book
i
saw
this
beer
as
a
solid
homage
to
the
likes
of
duvel
pours
a
pale
slightly
clouded
golden
hue
into
a
chalice
the
bright
white
head
layered
up
nicely
forming
fine
belgian
style
lacing
that
formed
even
layers
as
it
dwindled
aromatics
provided
a
nice
malt
driven
honey
drizzled
biscuit
pale
malt
with
hints
of
spice
and
dry
yeast
notes
tropical
fruit
with
a
spicy
alcoholic
tone
as
well
finishes
with
herbal
spiciness
from
both
the
hops
and
the
yeast
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
flavor
was
actually
not
as
complex
as
the
smell
which
i
was
surprised
by
expected
a
tropical
fruit
flavor
also
accompanied
by
pale
malt
breadiness
with
citricherbal
hops
shining
through
nice
dry
yeast
finish
with
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
perfect
this
is
where
must
brewers
screw
up
a
belgian
style
ale
this
one
hits
it
with
a
nice
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
perfect
for
the
style
drinkability
was
effort
lesst
this
is
definitely
textbook
solid
belgian
style
ale
everybody
else
take
notes
because
this
is
the
training
wheel
level
belgian
ale
from
russian
river
once
they
start
with
wild
yeasts
and
barrel
aging
things
get
even
better
thanks
god
this
is
a
really
great
place
to
start
i
want
more
very
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
very
smooth
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
d
as
good
as
can
be
for
a
beer
with
7
75
abv
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
second
best
bspa
i
have
had
if
only
duvel
was
not
such
a
great
beer
this
could
have
a
chance
still
a
great
change
of
pace
and
a
clearly
wellcrafted
brew
overall
impression
excellent
body
and
aroma
for
the
style
but
too
metallic
carbonation
is
fairly
high
but
right
on
for
the
style
flavor
coats
your
palate
for
quite
a
while
without
being
too
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
enjoy
this
one
big
thanks
to
a
nonba
friend
in
philly
for
sending
this
gift
along
d
light
delicious
and
well
balanced
what
more
needs
to
be
said
this
was
a
late
christmas
present
from
my
sister
in
seattle
my
first
rr
bottle
refermentation
experience
poured
slowly
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
yellowgold
cloudy
color
smell
apple
butter
chardonnay
a
hint
of
clove
taste
apple
cider
flavors
belgian
yeast
is
very
present
nice
refreshing
carbonation
some
spices
and
there
is
that
clove
again
mouthfeel
i
love
the
big
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
drinkability
i
had
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
on
this
and
let
it
warm
up
this
is
amazingly
drinkable
overall
im
impressed
i
also
got
supplication
and
temptation
in
this
package
i
cant
wait
to
try
those
how
is
it
that
the
brewery
that
makes
the
best
ipa
on
the
planet
is
also
capable
of
doing
something
this
different
and
still
have
it
be
worldclass
its
unfair
that
we
cant
get
rr
in
texas
another
tick
on
my
rr
tion
quest
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
jerriko
for
sending
me
multiple
bottles
of
this
in
a
past
trade
batch
047
so
close
served
from
bottle
into
a
surly
darkness
snifter
thanks
for
this
glass
lunch
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
three
finger
pure
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
earthy
dark
fruit
and
very
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
lowmild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
the
flavors
of
this
one
were
very
close
to
the
ones
i
picked
up
on
when
i
tried
a
23
while
in
cali
but
without
the
wood
and
everything
in
this
one
seemed
muted
in
comparison
however
for
a
beer
of
this
style
it
was
quite
excellent
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
very
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
this
one
d
good
definitely
the
lesser
of
the
russian
river
beers
that
ive
had
but
not
a
bad
one
by
any
means
these
guys
really
know
what
theyre
doing
has
good
flavors
that
er
on
the
spicy
side
for
sure
bitting
up
front
the
pepper
has
been
doubled
and
covers
alot
of
the
fainter
fruits
that
were
on
the
nose
surprisingly
dry
with
a
noble
hop
earthyness
an
awesome
tasting
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
very
floral
fruity
banana
and
yeast
taste
light
and
dry
floral
body
mellow
and
sweet
fruity
notes
very
earthy
beer
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
excellent
beer
d
not
a
hint
of
booziness
very
smooth
and
light
on
the
tongue
while
its
a
good
beer
its
not
great
that
being
said
its
probably
one
of
the
better
americanmade
versions
ive
had
da
good
beer
but
not
russian
rivers
best
production
or
interpretation
of
a
beer
style
ill
be
damned
i
have
finally
had
a
russian
river
beer
i
wont
care
to
have
again
not
my
favorite
bsa
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
can
taste
and
appreciate
drinkability
is
pretty
high
overall
its
tasty
and
not
too
agressive
on
the
palate
as
stated
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
per
suggestions
on
the
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
bright
orangeyellow
coloring
cloudy
and
vibrant
there
was
a
thin
sparsely
foamed
head
that
dissipated
quickly
there
is
a
sourciderapple
type
smell
blended
with
malty
notes
bits
of
spice
in
the
nose
also
the
beer
has
a
lowgrade
light
malt
forward
flavor
with
some
spice
and
citrus
sweet
offshoots
very
mild
flavors
and
not
overspiced
like
some
belgians
tasty
the
spice
sticks
through
to
the
aftertaste
and
there
is
a
smooth
slightly
sour
finish
to
the
brew
pretty
tasty
throughout
but
a
creepingly
strong
flavor
that
makes
this
a
tough
one
to
followup
immediately
with
because
of
the
hard
availability
of
this
though
i
wouldnt
be
knocking
down
grandma
to
get
it
its
good
but
i
am
not
blown
away
by
it
at
all
d
made
me
wish
i
had
just
bought
another
bottle
of
this
instead
of
angry
boy
brown
ale
very
drinkable
amazing
damn
good
damnation
one
of
the
better
belgian
strong
pales
ive
had
yet
not
to
be
my
last
drinkable
but
not
as
enjoyable
to
my
palate
as
the
more
balanced
crisper
redemption
and
maybe
my
least
favorite
russian
river
to
date
note
least
favorite
rr
is
still
winning
then
again
bspas
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
have
a
hard
time
immediately
thinking
of
one
i
prefer
375ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
this
bottle
is
from
batch
62
but
there
is
no
info
for
this
batch
on
russian
rivers
website
yet
pours
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
an
inch
of
lumpy
foam
an
lots
of
carbonation
but
the
foam
quickly
dissipates
and
there
is
no
lacing
spicy
and
sweet
nose
with
classic
belgian
notes
of
banana
medium
bodied
with
spot
on
carbonation
rich
and
full
on
the
palate
there
is
an
earthy
quality
to
it
that
is
unique
its
not
a
roasted
malt
taste
i
enjoy
it
honey
and
banana
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
long
and
sweet
but
not
syrupy
or
resiny
very
pleasant
even
though
it
doesnt
exit
the
palate
cleanly
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
whole
750ml
bottle
to
myself
easily
aroma
is
floral
and
vibrant
like
the
first
day
of
spring
rosewater
corn
i
get
that
from
sugar
adjuncts
and
fruit
fresh
from
the
vine
stalk
bush
wherever
taste
follows
up
the
fruity
cornucopia
beautifully
i
pick
up
green
apple
cantaloupe
and
fresh
pear
champagneish
carbonation
and
delicate
body
fits
the
sinisterly
sessionable
character
perfectly
drinkable
dangerously
so
batch
60
appearance
is
clear
golden
with
an
almost
vortex
of
turbidity
in
the
center
sweet
standard
belgian
smell
very
nice
a
great
taste
nicely
sweet
lingering
bitterness
then
dry
a
solid
belgian
style
but
for
some
reason
more
appealing
freshness
id
get
it
again
but
would
be
nice
to
find
something
more
easily
attainable
with
this
taste
will
have
to
keep
looking
drinks
off
the
charts
theres
not
much
including
the
2012
end
of
the
world
event
that
could
ever
make
me
not
want
another
one
of
these
wonderful
brews
i
know
what
im
drinking
come
the
end
of
the
world
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
i
was
worried
about
it
but
it
ended
up
pulling
through
in
the
end
what
a
great
beer
russian
river
my
hats
off
to
you
drinkability
going
through
this
way
too
fast
wish
this
was
a
750
d
very
good
i
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
as
they
are
among
the
better
of
the
belgian
strong
pales
a
tasty
citrus
malty
backbone
makes
it
a
refreshing
drink
for
a
warm
day
d
a
great
easy
to
drink
belgian
style
ale
good
complexity
i
really
wish
i
had
more
verdict
good
beer
worth
trying
for
its
complexity
but
not
elite
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
and
a
wonderful
beverage
but
i
expected
a
tad
more
from
rr
amazing
to
say
the
least
but
this
is
just
a
little
let
down
i
was
very
excited
to
finally
try
something
from
russian
river
a
friend
of
mine
shipped
some
home
for
the
holidays
it
poured
a
watery
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
light
light
white
head
it
had
some
slight
cloudiness
and
bubbled
the
entire
time
it
smelled
of
yeast
and
alcohol
i
wouldve
expected
and
preferred
something
more
it
taste
fine
but
wasnt
spectacular
it
was
good
but
not
life
altering
it
drank
smoothly
and
pretty
thin
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
you
wouldnt
know
that
this
was
near
8
at
all
it
was
good
but
not
anything
too
special
pungent
ripe
oranges
with
some
belgium
yeast
and
spices
the
refermented
yeasts
give
a
dense
punget
ripe
taste
but
the
balance
of
the
spice
and
fruit
balances
it
out
perfectly
best
golden
ale
ive
ever
had
wish
i
could
get
some
more
drinkability
very
pleasant
with
well
hidden
alcohol
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
just
enough
of
an
aftertaste
to
entice
another
appearance
has
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
healthy
head
and
good
lace
smell
has
a
light
yeasty
farmhouse
belgian
aroma
with
citrus
notes
taste
is
spicey
floral
and
pretty
much
a
straight
forward
belgian
style
with
minimal
alchohol
present
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
easy
drinking
but
not
to
complex
belgian
style
ale
overall
i
loved
this
beer
its
semireadily
available
so
i
will
turn
to
this
often
for
me
it
jostles
with
bruery
premiere
for
my
favorite
beer
had
this
on
tap
a
couple
times
on
my
trip
i
reviewed
it
twice
in
my
phone
without
realizing
luckily
i
basically
wrote
the
same
thing
so
this
is
combining
of
the
two
notes
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
smells
fruity
i
think
i
get
sweet
pear
to
go
with
belgian
yeast
very
dry
flavour
overall
i
get
some
spices
more
in
the
aftertaste
almost
like
a
saison
d
this
is
an
all
around
great
brew
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
access
to
them
and
a
pub
to
get
draft
pulls
a
nice
all
around
brew
overall
a
very
nice
beer
in
the
style
personal
preference
is
for
more
floral
spice
think
pranqster
but
this
was
very
good
this
beer
is
a
winner
great
representation
of
the
style
abv
well
hidden
drinkability
a
fine
drinking
brew
from
russian
river
the
first
one
ive
had
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
usually
have
at
least
one
of
these
in
my
cellar
this
is
my
last
one
guess
i
gotta
go
buy
more
and
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
anybody
cheers
i
would
drink
this
much
faster
if
i
know
i
could
get
them
more
readily
or
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
in
my
area
really
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
that
i
might
drink
tonight
d
a
nice
subtle
take
on
the
style
quite
refreshing
drink
if
this
was
cheaper
i
could
drink
4
in
a
row
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
like
this
offering
much
better
from
the
bottle
than
the
tap
this
is
a
wonderful
belgian
style
american
ale
lots
of
bright
citrus
with
a
slight
funky
note
from
the
belgian
yeast
banana
clove
spice
and
citrus
all
combine
to
form
a
rich
yet
refined
brew
medium
weight
not
too
heavy
perfect
alcohol
content
for
the
body
finishes
very
smooth
immensely
drinkable
and
satisfying
poured
in
a
glass
it
is
golden
yellow
in
color
the
aroma
is
like
fresh
bread
and
some
fruit
like
characteristics
like
applepear
lemon
zest
possibly
from
the
belgian
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
sweet
but
hints
of
lemon
and
citrus
in
terms
of
body
its
very
light
and
had
about
a
2
finger
head
and
medium
carbonation
theres
a
lot
of
complexity
and
flavors
for
what
i
would
consider
a
pretty
light
ale
light
and
refreshing
for
the
summer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
although
it
was
not
my
favorite
of
the
beers
i
tried
that
day
at
russian
river
brewing

but
a
good
treat
every
now
and
then
solid
throughout
overall
a
decent
belgian
but
the
taste
alters
a
bit
too
much
from
the
nose
in
an
unwilling
favor
nice
mouthfeel
but
ends
too
dry
for
me
decent
drinkability
wasnt
particularly
sure
if
this
would
be
sour
or
not
it
wasnt
but
it
was
a
really
good
brew
in
my
opinion
light
zesty
refreshing
it
reminds
me
of
a
spring
beeractually
in
the
same
vein
as
fantome
printemps
though
not
as
good
light
bodied
well
carbonated
great
drinkability
lemons
some
grassiness
and
light
maltyeast
notes
are
the
big
players
here
the
taste
is
lemon
alcohol
and
slight
biscuit
the
alcohol
is
definitely
but
almost
in
a
good
way
and
is
covered
pretty
well
for
the
most
part
light
to
medium
bodied
finishes
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
well
carbonated

great

nice

with
good

the
sip
yields
a
nice
flavor
of
fruit
cocktail
with
the
aformentioned
fruit
but
without
too
much
sweetness
some
alcohol
notes
some
bitterness
kicks
in
in
the
middle
and
stays
arond
until
the
end
drinks
fairly
dry
ends
nicely
with
a
subtle
warming
effect
i
went
into
this
beer
without
expectations
and
i
find
this
is
quite
a
nice
drinking
beer
without
being
overly
cloying
or
boozy
this
brew
pours
a
golden
straw
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
whipped
three
finger
head
and
heaps
of
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
mainly
banannas
and
belgian
yeast
mixed
with
tropical
punchit
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
yeasty
bread
the
first
flavour
i
get
followed
with
a
banannacoconutpaw
paw
hit
very
tropical
flavours
and
is
rounded
out
with
a
barley
sugar
sweetness
right
at
the
endoverall
not
bad
but
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
but
glad
ive
tried
it
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
drink
another
if
it
had
a
little
more
flavor
d
highly
drinkable
this
one
does
not
exhaust
your
palate
after
a
sip
d
i
tend
to
think
of
this
brew
as
the
baseline
brew
for
rrs
sour
beer
offerings
eg
supplication
temptation
consecration
etc
dont
expect
a
jawlocking
sour
experience
here
and
if
one
were
to
do
a
rr
sour
beer
tasting
i
would
recommend
to
start
with
this
one
i
honestly
couldnt
image
a
more
refreshing
craft
drinker
d
this
beer
is
a
faithful
but
characteristically
american
interpretation
of
the
style
thats
delicious
and
continually
invigorating
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
felt
before
it
is
tasted
in
line
with
other
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ales
of
quality
capable
of
taking
the
place
of
a
dry
white
wine
in
pairings
the
presence
of
too
many
heavy
savory
flavors
would
bury
the
delicate
nuances
found
here
o
a
definite
sipper
this
one
definitely
drinks
like
a
strong
pale
ale
ddelightful
just
a
great
beer
highly
drinkable
and
i
would
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
inoffensive
example
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
but
there
are
too
many
outstanding
alternatives
out
there
to
convince
me
to
revisit
this
one
d
awesome
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
solid
showing
clean
sweet
and
only
a
few
flaws
above
average
by
far
id
love
a
few
more
of
these
just
to
enjoy
while
playing
some
lol
very
drinkable
and
dangerously
sessionable
drinkability
a
wonderful
and
delicate
beer
that
gets
the
flavor
out
one
of
the
most
pleasant
citrus
beers
i
have
had
this
might
be
my
favorite
in
the
style
i
do
want
this
again
an
enjoyable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
could
go
for
one
or
two
more
in
a
sitting
d
just
the
right
amount
of
drinkability
for
me
enjoyable
and
easy
to
keep
drinking
but
rich
enough
to
make
you
savor
the
flavor
i
have
never
been
an
outspoken
fan
of
this
beer
but
rating
its
components
i
keep
coming
back
to
them
all
being
very
good
strange
i
suppose
that
as
a
whole
it
just
doesnt
make
that
much
of
an
impression
on
me
while
still
being
a
superbly
well
crafted
brew
mind
you
i
do
enjoy
this
with
some
regularity
d
a
delightful
beer
something
id
buy
again
if
it
wasnt
such
a
rare
find
here
drink
im
sure
its
not
an
everyday
beer
however
it
was
a
good
beer
and
for
what
it
is
a
great
example
of
what
rr
can
do
with
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
1
or
else
a
second
would
sneak
up
on
you
and
make
you
forget
a
section
of
time
despite
the
mouthfeel
you
continue
to
drink
to
try
to
discern
and
enjoy
the
underlying
flavors
pours
a
heady
golden
color
lots
of
lingering
frothy
goodness
aroma
is
sweet
earthy
flowery
and
spicy
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
notes
of
banana
clove
and
some
spice
followed
by
bready
malts
a
real
nice
balance
to
this
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
damn
good
example
being
my
first
russian
river
beer
i
will
have
to
say
im
impressed
by
the
overall
presentation
of
their
products
these
people
really
care
about
beer
and
it
is
seen
in
their
craftsmanship
excellent
job
overall
a
very
drinkable
complex
ale
the
flavor
is
very
good
and
makes
for
a
nice
palatefriendly
beer
it
has
some
good
funk
to
it
and
tastes
like
a
really
good
white
ale
d
when
you
pour
a
beer
called
damnation
you
expect
something
dark
and
strong
strangely
it
wasnt
however
the
taste
really
made
up
for
it
no
flavors
really
jumped
out
but
the
blend
was
very
good
would
have
drank
a
couple
more
of
these
if
i
could
a
light
wheat
but
very
tasty
it
is
similar
to
duval
d
eady
to
drink
great
offering
from
russian
river
i
see
how
its
a
classic
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
d
easily
drinkable
just
another
solid
russian
river
beer
d
this
beer
was
nicely
drinkable
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
straight
up
4
beer
good
but
nothing
about
about
it
really
stood
out
as
remarkable
drinkability
this
is
certainly
a
good
beer
but
not
worldclass
this
beer
may
in
a
small
way
suffer
from
comparison
to
the
plinys
and
its
tion
brethren
subtle
quite
drinkable
but
it
really
doesnt
compare
to
much
of
the
pales
from
the
old
country
for
the
price
one
would
be
better
off
with
its
obvious
inspiration
duvel
this
is
very
drinkable
and
an
overall
solid
brew
however
it
is
not
the
finest
rr
has
to
offer
poured
this
into
my
snifter
and
noticed
a
thick
foamy
head
that
soon
dissipated
to
leave
a
thick
cap
smell
is
of
banana
cloves
honey
and
of
course
yeast
taste
is
of
honey
spice
and
slight
hoppiness
that
is
hidden
by
heavy
yeast
mouthfeel
is
immediately
crisp
and
tart
with
high
carbonation
smacking
you
in
palate
drinkability
is
high
goes
down
easy
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
have
been
impressed
with
neary
everything
i
have
had
from
russian
river
ample
carbonation
and
a
light
full
mouthfeel
initial
banana
sweetness
balanced
by
lemon
bitterness
and
some
creaminess
with
a
touch
of
wheat
character
finish
doesnt
linger
too
long
but
is
very
nice
with
some
sour
apple
tartness
and
just
a
bit
of
metallic
character
very
nice
overall
with
a
solid
balance
of
flavors
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
a
wine
drinker
making
the
transition
overall
a
big
thanks
goes
out
to
wisrarebeer
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
sanfran
russian
river
damnation
is
amongst
the
finest
beers
ive
tasted
it
has
an
elegant
appearance
with
a
persistent
head
and
a
strong
hops
nose
the
taste
is
a
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
barley
with
a
distinct
belgian
bite
and
smooth
feel
give
this
beer
a
shot
and
youll
be
glad
you
did
lightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
medium
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
small
particles
floating
freely
and
thin
sheets
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
potent
fruit
banana
and
melon
and
yeast
mediumbodied
and
tart
with
fruit
and
peppery
spices
along
with
some
hops
and
malt
the
finish
is
spicy
and
short
with
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
of
banana
and
clove
the
palate
opens
sweeter
than
the
nose
would
suggest
with
a
rather
prominent
blend
of
spices
and
fruit
pear
and
citrus
come
to
mind
and
the
spice
is
rather
prominent
with
white
pepper
and
an
almost
astringent
drying
spice
character
that
i
cant
quite
place
mildly
sweet
theres
a
blend
of
sugar
and
honey
the
midpalate
also
has
a
floral
character
with
some
rose
water
medium
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
is
really
zippy
on
the
palate
more
than
i
like
and
more
than
i
remember
it
being
i
wonder
if
the
elevation
here
in
breckenridge
is
causing
more
carbonation
to
be
liberated
than
would
be
expected
at
sea
level
the
finish
is
drying
and
spicy
which
while
intense
is
not
too
much
solid
stuff
i
really
like
this
beer
but
when
i
can
get
a
duvel
for
144pack
i
wouldnt
drink
this
too
often
not
as
hoppy
as
duvel
either
clear
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
had
very
good
retentionn
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
lacing
was
a
little
weak
spicy
aroma
of
cloves
some
fruit
and
honey
elements
but
the
spice
is
the
big
player
a
little
more
complex
in
flavor
still
plenty
of
spice
but
i
also
get
some
white
wine
mead
lemon
zest
and
some
earthy
hops
the
more
of
this
bottle
i
drink
the
drier
it
seems
to
get
medium
body
with
a
lovely
carbonation
love
the
texture
of
this
beer
if
anyone
could
challenge
duvel
or
delirium
tremors
it
would
be
russian
river
an
excellant
example
and
finely
crafted
beer
that
comes
close
to
those
belgian
greats
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
left
wanting
i
have
another
bottle
from
this
batch
in
the
cellar
hopefully
it
will
stand
up
to
the
expectation
i
have
of
a
russian
river
golden
after
a
few
years
down
there
drinks
well
fruity
spicy
and
pretty
tasty
alcohol
is
integrated
and
barely
detectable
would
drink
again
as
a
refreshing
alternative
to
bigger
beers
though
thats
impossible
due
to
my
location
relative
to
its
distribution
when
im
finished
with
this
bottle
id
love
to
have
another
first
exposure
to
the
belgian
side
of
russian
rivers
portfolio
and
damn
are
we
off
to
a
good
start
d
well
its
certainly
strong
its
got
a
lot
to
like
mainly
the
fact
that
its
about
as
dry
and
warming
as
a
single
malt
scotch
not
sure
that
its
all
that
sessionable
but
then
what
pioneering
american
beer
is
these
days
im
not
a
fan
of
that
smell
though
it
belies
a
funkiness
the
taste
doesnt
actually
deliver
on
thankfully
damn
drinkability
very
drinkable
enjoyed
very
much
russian
river
does
it
again
with
another
great
beer
notes
really
really
tasty
a
little
too
expensive
i
think
but
beer
costs
what
beer
costs
i
can
understand
that
drinkability
suffers
a
little
due
to
such
high
carbonation
level
glad
to
have
drank
this
one
and
would
gladly
drink
another
mfd
highly
carbonated
that
quickly
dissipates
could
drink
as
a
session
beer
too
bad
its
not
available
in
the
midwest
hard
to
believe
its
7
75
poured
from
a
bomber
batch
54
into
a
sniftertulip
glass
its
a
goldenyellow
color
with
a
moderate
thumbsized
white
fluffy
head
excellent
lacing
faint
smell
of
belgian
spices
and
citrus
the
taste
is
very
mild
and
somewhat
tangy
belgian
spices
and
yeast
almost
tastes
like
muted
fruit
loops
cereal
it
has
that
mash
of
flavors
that
are
complex
but
dont
allow
you
to
pick
out
what
is
going
on
since
they
are
so
subdued
its
an
interesting
taste
difficult
to
describe
its
slightly
lightbodied
but
mouthfeel
is
still
adequate
its
certainly
drinkable
nothing
tremendously
outstanding
here
but
its
well
crafted
d
had
this
once
a
while
back
and
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
because
it
wasnt
anywhere
as
good
as
this
very
solid
brew
that
is
easy
any
enjoyable
to
drink
but
its
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
belgian
ones
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
department
still
yet
another
amazing
rr
beer
drinkablility
is
excellent
i
expected
less
than
the
7
75
russian
river
does
an
excellent
job
at
replicating
an
already
excellent
style
love
the
price
compared
to
other
rrs
will
seek
out
again
d
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
especially
from
an
american
brewery
russian
river
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
carbonation
is
not
overdone
and
the
beer
is
not
extra
heavy
drinkability
is
superior
with
little
alcohol
burn
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
bspa
if
i
didnt
see
the
bottle
i
would
have
guessed
it
wasnt
brewed
in
the
us
the
bottle
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
edit
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
more
prominent
grape
and
vinous
flavor
especially
white
wine
it
is
slightly
tart
and
delicious
an
enjoyable
domestic
take
on
a
classic
style
though
not
quite
on
par
with
the
better
belgian
examples
t
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
very
well
lots
of
spicy
white
pepper
very
juicy
with
light
fruits
like
green
apple
and
pear
a
chalkiness
from
the
earthy
spicy
yeast
comes
around
at
the
end
just
before
a
refreshing
blast
of
pear
juice
taste
has
assertive
carbonation
the
yeast
has
a
good
presence
but
isnt
overwhelming
the
citrus
is
refreshing
a
decent
amount
of
spice
kick
md
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
light
but
not
surprising
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
it
didnt
have
a
lot
that
stuck
out
to
me
pours
well
golden
with
a
little
one
finger
white
head
dense
bubbles
and
fades
to
a
thin
white
ring
around
my
glass
aroma
is
of
fruity
yeasty
esters
specifically
apple
pear
and
apricot
and
a
little
wet
dog
tastes
crisp
clean

green

wow
the
taste
is
very
divine
ive
had
this
beer
fresh
but
this
ones
got
a
bit
of
time
on
it
the
flavors
are
very
complex
with
such
subtleties
that
make
it
an
awesome
belgian
style
ale
initially
you
get
the
crisp

theres
a

is
in

really
liking

is
extremely
high
with
alcohol
hidden
perfectly
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
impressed
with
my
first
offering
from
russian
river
i
will
definitely
be
trying
more
from
them
a
stellar
brew
and
another
star
from
this
incredible
brewery
quite
tasty
although
a
bit
funky
for
me
funk
heads
would
not
be
disappointed
db
a
nice
balanced
belgian
flavor
not
too
spicy
with
a
good
fruit
aspect
and
some
hops
hard
to
describe
because
it
is
really
just
another
variation
on
the
often
unbalanced
belgian
flavor
set
i
dunno
nothing
really
struck
me
as
great
for
this
one
a
rarity
for
russian
river
then
again
bspa
has
never
been
my
favorite
style
ddrinkablility
as
with
just
about
any
other
rr
beer
ive
had
this
is
top
notch
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
with
a
good
take
on
the
style
this
is
worth
finding
to
try
sometime
pretty
easy
to
have
several
of
these
and
not
notice
that
its
a
fairly
strong
beer
this
was
my
first
russian
river
and
now
im
more
jazzed
up
to
eventually
try
the
plinys
than
ever
im
lucky
enough
to
live
in
pa
where
i
get
to
at
least
try
some
of
this
brewerys
offerings
on
the
east
coast
but
ive
still
yet
to
find
either
the
elder
or
younger
maybe
someday
this
will
certainly
do
in
the
meantime
poured
a
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
left
good
blotchy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aromas
were
wonderful
which
consisted
of
pears
apples
banana
slight
spice
belgian
yeast
and
a
good
malt
presence
the
flavors
on
the
palate
were
very
similar
to
the
nose
but
the
fruit
characters
were
a
bit
more
potent
which
was
a
great
thing
for
me
it
was
nicely
balanced
and
had
nice
pear
apple
banana
and
spice
notes
that
really
complimented
each
other
the
malt
was
not
as
but
did
help
out
to
stabilize
the
sweetness
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
fruity
and
slight
crisp
finish
it
drank
very
well
and
was
super
tasty
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottle
and
have
to
say
i
like
it
better
out
of
the
bottle
im
glad
i
have
access
to
this
beer
on
a
daily
d
okay
but
i
think
i
would
rather
switch
over
to
some
of
the
drier
and
cleanerfinishing
examples
of
the

duvel
afflgem
blond
before
having
many
of
these
in

still
a
great
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a

that
is
made

the
only

so
i
can

put

d
almost
want

on

d
great

really
loved
this

i
would
drink
it

if
i
could

a

that
wont
bog
you
down

may
start
to
feel
like
a

much
though
at
nearly

but
i
feel
that
if
time
is
taken
this
could
be
drank
all

taste
is
mildly
sweet
pretty
highly
carbed

brewed

tasty
brew
for
sure
poured
from
a
330ml
corked

has
a
ridiculous

and
a
really
nice
honey
yellow
orange
color
going
on
smell
is
very
fruity
and
has
a
touch
of
floral

going

very
very
nice
has
a
fruity
taste
with
sour
peaches
and
nectarines
slight
hop
profile
to
balance
out
the
body
of
the

really
spectacular
mouthfeel
is
nice
also
with
that
belgian
style
floral
hops
going
on
drinkability
is
also
high
as
this
is
really
just
delicious
and
balanced
my
second
russian
river
beer
and
love
it
d
different
for
the
style
but
i
really
like
what
russian
river
has
done
with
this
it
is
very
earthy
smells
strongly
of
cedar
when
cold
and
as
it
warms
the
fruit
flavor
and
smell
come
out
i
will
be
having
this
again
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
d
yes
very
drinkable
thanks
colonelforbin
for
an
amazing
extra
f
dries
well
with
some
lingering
wheat
and
belgian
malts
some
citrus
and
orange
as
well
touch
of
a
malty
finish
with
slightest
hint
of
bready
flavors
this
is
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
something
i
enjoyed
though
it
has
just
a
bit
to
much
soapy
hops
for
me
if
you
can
get
past
that
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
drinks
with
ease
russian
rivers
choice
to
distribute
some
of
the
bigger
beers
in
375
ml
bottles
is
welcome
as
it
makes
these
epic
brews
that
much
more
affordable
attainable
and
easy
to
drink
in
one
sitting
a
375
of
damnation
sits
atop
the
list
its
a
damn
good
example
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
and
while
not
vinnies
best
it
may
just
be
his
most
drinkable
overall
good
beer
russian
river
has
yet
to
disappoint
however
this
beer
was
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
golden
ale
i
think
that
its
just
different
enough
to
be
more
innovative
than
disappointing
if
that
makes
sense
dhighly
drinkable
and
delicious
but
its
so
hard
to
obtain
in
maryland
i
can
get
it
in
the
philly
area
suburbs
but
thats
still
a
good
hour
drive
its
a
great
version
of
this
style
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
as
with
just
about
any
other
rr
beer
ive
had
this
is
top
notch
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
with
a
good
take
on
the
style
this
is
worth
finding
to
try
sometime
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
rr
damnation
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
pour
and
a
very
pillowy
sticky
head
aromas
are
doughs
and
lemons
with
some
banana
and
yeast
taste
is
pretty
light
but
refreshing
palate
is
lemon
peels
yeast
subtle
alcohol
notes
and
pines
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summer
brew
that
is
very
refreshing
damnation
is
a
fine
beer
to
say
the
least
drinkability
is
great
though
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
im
definitely
feeling
it
on
one
hand
i
kind
of
wish
i
split
this
with
someone
else
then
again
my
drinking
buddy
that
would
most
appreciate
it
moved
to
seattle
told
me
a
few
days
ago
about
a
bar
that
had
this
on
tap
on
second
thought
no
regrets
about
enjoying
this
by
myself
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
feels
like
a
quencher
and
the
abv
doesnt
show
up
pretty
good
drinking
but
i
can
see
slapping
some
ice
cubes
in
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
just
isnt
that
complex
to
me
it
drinks
like
a
like
a
lower
abv
beer
and
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
fine
belgian
ale
it
doesnt
have
any
features
that
make
the
beer
stand
out
in
the
style
but
its
a
solid
beer
that
cant
quite
stand
up
to
the
classic
belgian
beers
like
la
chouffe
and
duvel
i
love
this
beer
damnations
incredibly
wellbalanced
profile
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
and
endlessly
repeatable
md
thin
body
and
nicely
balanced
carbonation
this
is
a
pleasant
ale
but
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
it
all
the
time
especially
if
its
between
this
and
a
duvel
d
i
may
not
be
one
to
buy
this
again
and
again
but
if
its
offered
to
me
ill
never
turn
it
down
im
glad
that
one
of
russian
rivers
belgians
got
into
my
preocs
beer
experience
this
seems
almost
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
bspa
the
alcohol
has
no
presence
at
all
no
spice
no
heat
as
my
first
of
the
style
it
has
left
a
favorable
impression
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
levels
are
very
high
probably
too
high
overall
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
no
off
flavors
d
easy
drinking
and
totally
cant
detect
the
7
75
abv
just
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
profile
the
first
rr
beer
that
hasnt
wowed
me
it
was
bound
to
happen
sooner
or
later
d
very
good
drinkability
given
the
abv
the
carbonation
and
light
body
make
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
ill
also
add
that
while
people
seem
to
be
going
nuts
over
sofie
and
matilda
from
goose
island
damnation
has
been
around
and
is
just
as
good
of
an
example
of
the
style
is
damnation
as
good
as
duvel
not
to
me
but
thats
a
hard
standard
to
live
up
to
damnation
is
one
of
the
finest
belgian
strong
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
i
like
that
it
is
available
in
smaller
bottle
size
id
buy
it
for
meal
pairings
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
not
my
style
but
good
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
certainly
no
duvel
cheers
to
psiweaver
for
the
750
ml
bottle
damnation
pours
a
nice
looking
nearly
opaque
tangerine
a
voluminous
frothy
white
head
forms
and
lingers
but
the
lacing
or
lack
thereof
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
aroma
is
good
clove
and
some
sweet
fruits
but
im
hoping
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
more
to
it
my
prayers
are
answered
as
in
addition
to
the
flavors
present
in
the
nose
theres
a
distinct
lemongrass
flavor
that
works
well
for
the
beer
its
still
not
quite
a
5
in
terms
of
flavor
but
warrants
a
bump
from
the
smell
score
vinnie
and
co
absolutely
nailed
the
mouthfeel
flawless
i
cant
speak
an
ill
word
towards
either
the
body
or
the
carbonation
damnation
tastes
good
enough
that
id
like
to
sip
and
savor
it
but
the
otherworldly
mouthfeel
makes
it
hard
to
restrain
myself
and
do
so
just
more
evidence
that
russian
river
is
one
of
the
top
breweries
in
the
country
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
just
not
really
up
to
the
standards
i
have
come
to
expect
from
rr
i
could
easily
finish
a
whole
bottle
myself
though
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
good
frothy
head
good
lacing
and
lively
carbonation
belgian
yeast
and
spices
in
the
smell
taste
was
much
the
same
with
some
citrusy
lemon
hints
light
bodied
with
a
thin
slick
texture
moderately
sweet
finish
with
short
flavor
duration
good
but
not
great
d
this
was
a
very
delicate
but
flavorful
beer
that
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
better
to
sip
i
honestly
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
with
the
waxy
character
but
it
was
still
very
well
brewed
and
mostly
enjoyable
d
a
solid
beer
that
is
great
and
refreshing
for
the
warm
summer
months
crisp
yet
has
a
good
dryness
and
fruit
to
keep
it
interesting
update
after
the
carbonation
drops
out
you
can
actually
taste
a
lot
more
in
the
beer
but
im
still
not
adjusting
my
scores
id
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
style
great
balance
refreshing
and
a
good
complexity
d
a
very
good
belgian
strong
ale
good
complexity
with
light
alcohol
warmth
not
too
heavy
but
definitely
not
one
you
can
down
easily
enough
strength
of
alcohol
and
flavors
to
keep
it
a
nice
somewhat
slow
drinker
one
to
be
savored
i
often
fear
with
american
craft
brews
especially
specialty
ones
that
ill
get
something
thats
way
over
the
top
this
beers
not
that
way
at
all
subtle
complex
balanced
big
thumbs
up
for
russian
river
here
d
i
wish
i
would
have
sprung
for
the
750
or
a
few
more
375
ml
bottles
of
this
its
a
fantastic
beer
with
even
better
drinkability
trade
anyone
my
god
does
this
beer
drink
smooth
based
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
alone
second
maybe
only
to
duvel
this
might
be
the
best
of
this
style
ive
ever
had
rr
good
d
it
was
great
to
sip
on
but
i
couldnt
wait
to
enjoy
every
last
drop
its
only
drawback
is
that
it
makes
you
just
want
it
too
quickly
feels
a
bit
foamy
a
little
bit
of
sizzle
and
quite
dry
on
the
back
decent
for
the
style
but
doesnt
amaze
me
overall
it
feels
a
bit
harsh
at
times
drinks
almost
like
a
lemon
slice
has
been
dropped
in
but
not
overall
offensive
a
decent
beer
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
bland
and
the
finish
is
unpleasant
after
drinking
pliny
the
elder
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
i
am
quite
disappointed
with
it
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
the
bay
area
dozens
of
times
and
i
found
it
to
be
so
much
better
perhaps
the
carbonation
was
dialed
in
by
their
taps
for
our
benefit
the
carbonation
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
style
d
interesting
but
a
bit
light
on
flavors
and
a
bit
over
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
though
12
finger
light
golden
clear
body
minimal
visible
carbonation
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
big
banana
and
clove
hit
with
the
taste
more
clove
than
bananas
tart
dry
finish
with
good
effervescence
good
attenuation
be
careful
re
drinkability
high
abv
creeper
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
jd
a
very
drinkable
beer
abv
is
hidden
well
its
not
the
most
complex
or
adventurous
rr
beer
ive
tried
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
just
how
solid
russian
rivers
brewing
expertise
is
this
could
easily
be
confused
for
a
genuine
belgian
d
sort
of
the
flagship
of
russian
rivers
belgians
and
with
good
reason
a
well
balanced
and
really
flavorful
beer
d
this
is
spot
on
as
far
as
a
belgian
golden
ale
is
concerned
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
crisp
no
hint
of
alcohol
makes
this
a
damn
good
beer
highly
recommended
d
this
may
be
better
than
most
of
the
belgian
brews
of
the
same
style
its
vibrant
flavorful
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
if
i
were
to
have
tasted
this
blind
i
would
have
sworn
it
was
from
belgium
poured
from
a
12oz
corked
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
amazing
head
on
the
pour
three
and
a
half
fingers
of
it
rich
golden
color
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
hazy
smells
like
bread
and
earth
with
some
citrus
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
the
yeast
is
sedated
but
adds
a
nice
sour
bread
note
to
the
whole
deal
nice
medium
body
very
easy
to
drink
ill
have
to
go
find
it
on
tap
and
give
it
another
go
very
drinkable
beer
very
belgian
in
style
very
nicely
done
ill
be
damned
taste
is
nice
and
delicate
moreso
than
i
thought
it
would
yeast
spiciness
and
esters
come
through
first
and
are
finished
off
nicely
with
a
hoppy
bite
there
is
some
sweet
grains
in
the
middle
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
overall
it
is
very
well
balanced
very
soft
beer
and
oh
so
drinkable
not
as
highly
carbonated
as
perhaps
a
duvel
but
the
carbonation
is
so
fine
that
it
is
very
silky
going
down
the
hatch
i
split
the
750
with
a
friend
and
my
half
disappeared
with
astonishing
rapidity
id
probably
say
that
i
like
duvel
better
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
makes
a
perfect
first
beer
of
the
day
another
example
of
incredible
beer
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
in
california
keep
up
the
good
work
this
beer
seems
far
easier
to
find
in
the
stores
than
blind
pig
or
pte
both
of
which
are
fantastic
d
at
7
75
abv
i
can
see
why
the
restaurant
was
pouring
8
oz
drafts
but
this
one
is
deceivingly
drinkable
a
great
springtimesummer
brew
especially
with
the
soft
dry
finish
this
is
one
extremely
drinkable
beer
low
carbonation
fairly
light
in
body
and
thus
pleasant
enough
to
drink
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
these
although
this
time
around
it
was
only
one
flavors
work
well
as
none
are
competing
with
each
other
good
harmony
the
tropical
fruit
flavor
burst
is
delicious
and
the
mouthfeel
accentuates
the
taste
highly
drinkable
and
very
well
crafted
drinkability
i
usually
can
not
drink
this
type
of
beer
for
more
than
one
750
ml
bottle
however
for
this
brew
i
could
drink
about
two
bombers
d
easy
enough
drinker
nice
tasting
wouldnt
mind
this
one
again
heres
a
lighter
strong
belgian
pale
for
you
aficionados
of
belgianstyled
beer
just
be
aware
that
the
375
ml
bottle
may
not
be
enough
for
some
overall
this
a
a
nice
beer
its
a
notch
or
2
under
duvel
for
the
style
but
very
drinkable
d
an
easy
drinker
but
not
something
i
want
a
bunch
of
in
a
night
reminds
me
a
lot
of
duvel
only
with
slightly
less
body
d
goes
down
easy
above
average
belgian
style
beer
from
a
good
brewery
recommended
for
sure
overall
great
will
buy
again
nice
balanced
well
done
belgian
golden
strong
not
unique
but
really
well
done
pale
yellow
body
with
a
thick
white
head
light
floral
notes
on
the
nose
along
with
belgian
yeast
and
maybe
a
hint
of
clove
on
the
palate
bready
malty
yeasty
flavors
cut
with
a
hint
of
spice
citrus
easy
to
drink
belgian
style
golden
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
d
excellent
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
d
very
drinkable
a
beer
id
definitely
go
back
to
d
excellent
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
begging
another
sip
or
to
be
paired
with
just
about
any
food
need
to
try
this
next
to
a
saison
because
this
reminded
me
very
much
of
dupont
but
perhaps
lacking
the
rustic
barnyardedge
an
awesome
belgianstyle
beer
that
can
stand
with
the
best
of
them
imported
or
not
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
its
smooth
and
elegant
and
complex
enough
to
invite
serious
imbibing
the
8
abv
doesnt
make
a
real
presence
except
for
a
very
slight
warmth
once
the
beer
reaches
temperature
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
this
beer
only
has
an
a
on
beeradvocate
com
i
give
it
a
solid
a
i
would
take
this
over
la
fin
du
monde
and
possibly
even
duvel
depending
on
my
mood
well
i
wouldnt
take
it
over
these
but
it
would
work
in
rotation
with
these
excellent
beers
over
all
very
reminiscent
of
the
style
good
job
by
russian
river
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
its
lightness
is
deceptive
though
the
7
75
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
and
unique
golden
belgian
ale
that
has
a
nice
array
of
flavors
and
hits
the
spot
a
touch
meaty
and
earthy
indeed
this
tastes
fantastic
i
definitely
get
the
standard
bready
taste
but
also
lots
of
hops
and
banana
there
are
layers
to
this
ale
you
get
the
sweet
flavors
at
first
and
finish
with
the
bitter
flavors
now
dont
get
me
wrong
this
isnt
an
extremely
hoppy
ale
but
you
do
get
it
towards
the
end
and
makes
it
exciting
to
drink
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
pale
ale
looked
great
and
had
a
very
nice
light
belgian
taste
didnt
get
much
bitterness
or
alcohol
taste
to
it
like
some
people
would
definitely
have
again
d
very
drinkable
not
much
else
to
say
deasy
drinking
doesnt
show
any
alcohol
pretty
big
flavors
ripe
golden
fruits
and
a
notes
of
spice
well
done
again
the
alcohol
is
minimally
detectable
this
has
good
flavor
and
is
one
you
can
easily
have
a
few
of
d
well
balanced
but
thought
it
would
have
a
little
more
flavor
still
this
one
gets
an
overall
noms
from
me
overall
impression
it
smelled
amazing
but
the
flavor
did
not
meet
expectations
i
expected
more
from
this
devilish
brew
still
its
a
hell
of
a
good
beer
and
its
definitely
worth
trying
d
at
nearly
8
abv
its
a
good
one
i
have
no
issues
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
light
on
the
stomach
and
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
food
or
just
to
have
after
a
long
day
d
great
overall
medium
bodied
surprisingly
low
carbonation
on
the
tongue
beer
is
fuller
than
i
thought
it
would
be
there
is
some
yeasty
esters
in
there
and
a
bitterness
with
a
citrus
lemon
like
character
to
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
fine
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
was
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
decent
the
aroma
was
bright
and
appealing
with
belgian
yeast
notes
bananas
lemon
and
spices
the
flavors
were
equally
enjoyable
a
wellbalanced
blend
of
citrus
hops
tangy
yeast
toasted
malt
pale
malt
spices
and
a
touch
of
grain
the
alcohol
was
well
folded
into
the
brew
and
it
had
a
nice
arc
of
starting
sweet
and
then
heading
towards
bitter
finishing
on
the
yeast
note
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
slightly
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
for
this
side
of
the
pond
but
still
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
real
belgian
article
d
awesome
belgian
american
beer
very
good
example
of
the
style
if
it
were
available
around
me
id
definitely
buy
it
definitely
worth
trying
m
good
body
a
little
more
carbonation
that
i
would
have
liked
but
im
certainly
not
going
to
let
that
ruin
what
is
otherwise
an
excellent
beer
d
could
drink
a
bottle
on
my
own
not
my
favorite
offering
from
rr
and
arguably
quite
overated
imho
especially
given
its
premium
pricepoint
d
very
well
balanced
this
750
ml
bottle
and
i
will
be
just
fine
overall
pretty
decent
and
highly
drinkabile
tripel
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
an
american
belgianinspired
however
it
is
not
a
superior
example
of
the
style
lacking
some
complexity
i
would
enjoy
the
chance
to
pair
it
with
a
mild
curry
and
see
what
pops
or
i
will
drink
it
again
on
the
merit
of
the
brewery
itself
and
be
rather
unimpressed
for
a
second
time
bummer
overall
a
fantastic
beer
a
great
beer
from
russian
riverone
with
refreshing
and
pleasant
fruityyeast
characteristics
that
dont
get
overwhelming
as
some
do
drinkability
first
off
this
beer
was
nothing
like
i
expected
i
thought
it
was
a
dark
belgium
turns
out
it
is
not
so
but
still
a
freaking
tasty
ass
brew
my
favorite
russian
river
brew
is
redemption
but
this
is
still
a
super
nice
brew
thanks
much
jeff
great
golden
color
when
poured
the
bitter
flavor
hits
you
at
the
back
of
the
jaw
and
lasts
throughout
the
drink
pours
well
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
excellent
smooth
flavor
and
body
that
is
really
enjoyable
its
a
classic
golden
ale
that
shouldnt
be
missed
very
enjoyable
beer
a
credit
to
rr
quite
tasty
the
only
thing
reminding
me
to
slow
down
is
the
slight
taste
and
warmth
from
the
alcohol
highly
recommended
and
something
i
would
love
to
try
again
thanks
to
raider
for
bringing
this
back
and
taking
it
out
of
his
cellar
d
highly
drinkable
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
great
balance
and
subtle
flavors
that
tend
to
be
lost
in
a
belgian
strong
especially
stateside
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
the
carbonation
has
a
tight
effervescense
my
only
complaint
is
the
yeast
gives
me
a
bit
of
heartburn
i
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
batch
51
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
turbid
golden
yellow
with
a
long
lasting
fizzy
white
head
the
nose
is
fruitysweet
with
lemons
being
the
dominant
smell
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
lemons
and
tart
apples
also
a
bit
spicy
it
has
a
somewhat
dry
finish
the
beer
has
a
wine
like
mouthfeel
it
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
damnation
is
a
damn
fine
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
d
well
balanced
goes
down
easily
slightly
prickly
carbonation
but
works
for
the
style
belgians
arent
my
goto
style
beer
but
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
pints
of
this
in
a
night
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
good
carb
white
head
some
cloudyness
but
very
welcome
with
decent
lacing
aromas
of
lemon
citrus
some
spice
and
floral
notes
very
lively
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
not
too
light
but
is
a
little
earthy
with
a
zesty
edge
a
very
satisfying
brew
and
although
it
isnt
as
good
as
batch
23
i
wish
it
were
around
me
all
the
time
pours
a
golden
color
typical
of
belgian
ales
sea
foam
disappears
quickly
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
very
flowery
with
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
again
flowery
with
a
bitter
bite
up
front
some
spiciness
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
burn
very
light
and
drinkable
extremely
enjoyable
overall
very
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
the
first
rr
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
loved
it
overall
with
all
the
hype
i
had
been
hearing
about
russian
river
beers
it
didnt
really
attain
those
high
marks
id
be
curious
to
see
if
the
long
travel
for
the
keg
had
this
beer
in
philly
had
anything
to
do
with
my
overall
impressions
would
like
to
try
this
straight
from
the
brewery
d
i
lke
this
beer
it
is
tasty
refreshing
and
very
quaffable
it
reminds
me
of
stones
calibelgie
without
the
bitter
hop
bite
in
the
finish
i
will
definitely
be
enjoing
more
of
these
in
the
future
the
beer
is
mediumtohigh
carbonation
which
is
what
i
expect
with
this
style
of
beer
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
alcohol
content
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
of
the
style
damnation
is
openly
an
ode
to
duvel
the
reported
original
of
belgiums
characteristic
strong
golden
ales
it
compares
very
favorably
perhaps
more
so
than
any
other
commercial
example
ive
tried
whether
from
inside
or
outside
of
belgium
increasingly
american
brewers
are
catching
up
to
their
belgian
counterparts
but
there
still
arent
many
who
can
beat
them
at
their
own
game
vinny
cilurzo
however
is
definitely
one
of
them

thanks
to
larrylsb
for
getting
this
one
from
the
brewpub
yesterday
rich
deep
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
starts
pretty
big
but
settles
into
a
thinner
layer
after
a
couple
minutes
the
aroma
has
some
pear
and
green
apple
some
light
lemon
cinnamon
and
spicy
alcohol
and
some
leafy
hops
pretty
sweet
honeylike
malt
flavors
with
fruity
accents
and
light
citrus
finishes
a
little
peppery
and
bitter
but
there
is
a
lingering
sweetness
too
medium
bodied
with
fizzy
bubbles
and
a
little
stickiness
in
the
end
nice
flavors
but
i
would
prefer
it
just
a
little
bit
dryer
d
i
crave
this
beer
and
order
it
whenever
it
pops
up
in
my
area
i
would
not
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
but
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
is
perfect
picked
up
a
bottle
rr
on
a
recent
road
trip
poured
into
tulip
slightly
hazy
and
golden
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
amazing
a
very
sweet
malt
candi
syrup
some
sweet
fruit
too
a
little
grain
as
well
taste
is
good
very
sweet
malt
with
some
bread
and
yeast
then
a
refreshing
blast
of
fruit
pear
and
apple
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
too
think
very
smooth
and
velvety
overall
a
great
beer
and
great
us
interpretation
of
the
style
my
only
dislike
was
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
but
not
too
much
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
very
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
really
sessionable
but
23
in
a
sitting
is
definitely
doable
very
mellow
calm
flavor
definately
picked
up
some
grapefruit
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
light
and
drinkable
with
a
low
to
mild
booze
taste
had
ontap
and
served
in
a
tulip
glass
at
a
local
bar
d
highly
recommended
were
this
ever
to
be
made
available
in
texas
i
would
frequent
this
more
often
on
tap
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelphia
pours
a
pale
gold
with
about
a
finger
of
head
which
has
good
lacing
and
retention
throughout
the
drink
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
little
bit
of
spiky
carbonation
aroma
is
sweet
fruits
orange
lemon
apple
some
peppery
spiciness
taste
is
a
fantastic
balance
of
sweet
fruit
pepper
and
light
bitterness
from
the
hops
yeast
was
a
little
more
upfront
than
i
would
like
in
a
belgian
pale
but
overall
the
brew
was
quite
good
i
would
take
this
over
a
duvel
any
day
of
the
week
drinkability
is
extremely
high
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
this
is
an
awesome
belgian
interpretation
and
although
its
not
that
hard
to
drink
i
could
see
it
taking
a
toll
after
a
few
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
generous
head
that
faded
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
musty
the
taste
was
sweet
pears
the
flavor
not
over
powered
by
excessive
carbonation
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
reasonable
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
warming
was
a
definite
benefit
for
this
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
general
a
strong
representation
of
the
style
nothing
im
seeking
actively
but
would
drink
again
if
given
the
opportunity
d
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
off
for
being
a
goto
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
russian
river
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
was
excellent
its
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
damnation
isnt
a
flavor
or
alcohol
bomb
and
its
complex
drinkable
and
so
delicious
alongside
orval
as
the
best
belgian
well
belgianinspired
in
this
case
beer
ive
had
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
would
rate
rather
well
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
the
only
fault
i
could
give
it
is
that
it
doesnt
add
up
to
other
things
i
have
had
from
them
but
since
thats
only
pliny
than
its
understandable
a
hazy
golden
body
with
a
pretty
tall
white
head
aroma
was
bready
with
some
light
yeasty
and
pearlike
esters
flavor
was
more
bready
than
anything
else
but
again
had
light
and
pleasing
fruit
and
yeast
esters
mouthfeel
was
light
and
effervescent
really
good
drinkability
incredibly
dangerous
two
bottles
of
this
would
have
me
ready
to
invade
northern
california
singlehandedly
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
overall
is
something
i
would
try
again
d
easy
to
drink
dangerously
easy
has
everything
it
needs
but
just
seems
to
come
up
a
little
short
of
outstanding
for
me
nice
beer
and
i
may
consider
aging
one
a
bit
recommended
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
quaffed
this
while
eating
and
while
i
probably
shouldnt
have
it
was
easy
to
do
so
did
not
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
overall
a
nice
beer
from
rr
though
i
do
not
think
i
would
seek
it
out
specifically
again
granted
i
have
a
bottle
in
storage
right
now
nb
i
like
it
a
bit
more
than
duvel
drinkability
is
solid
this
strong
pale
ale
goes
down
too
easily
if
you
forget
its
abv
so
sip
this
great
beer
drinkability
certainly
drinkable
but
a
little
too
much
sweetness
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
more
importantly
it
lives
up
to
my
memories
clearlight
yellow
when
poured
with
head
that
quickly
decreass
but
does
not
disappear
leaves
lace
to
let
you
know
what
was
there
and
what
remains
smells
slightly
sweet
but
not
overpowering
my
words
and
skills
cannot
adequately
desecribe
this
beer
it
is
deceptively
poundable
and
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
properly
stored
downstairs
well
wish
i
had
at
least
another
bomber
of
this
delight
easily
among
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
recommended
music
pairing
neil
young
after
the
goldrush
d
tasty
and
quenching
enough
to
allow
for
prolonged
drinking
but
the
abv
does
sneak
up
a
bit
feeling
a
little
silly
after
my
750
ml
d
very
great
drinkability
perhaps
one
of
the
best
belgian
golden
strongs
made
in
america
a
quality
brew
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
on
draft
than
the
bottle
but
that
speaks
to
the
style
generally
easily
drinkable
good
flavors
and
easy
on
the
palate
you
could
have
this
high
abv
beverage
with
a
slew
of
dining
options
and
it
wouldnt
wreck
your
palate
unless
you
decanted
the
beer
with
the
yeast
in
it
drinkability
is
good
for
a
belgian
pale
this
brings
the
flavor
albeit
a
bit
sharp
on
the
finish
well
done
but
not
great
pleasant
on
the
palate
until
the
finish
cheers
very
much
like
duvel
and
excellent
overall
like
duvel
as
well
belgium
beers
have
been
sought
after
for
centuries
in
the
great
beer
producing
country
of
belgium
the
brewers
have
made
some
what
of
a
tradition
to
give
their
brews
an
unusual
name
sometimes
the
names
are
curious
other
times
diabolical
and
then
again
they
can
just
be
silly
the
russian
river
brewery
out
of
california
has
prided
themselves
on
their
belgium
style
ales
and
have
out
done
themselves
with
the
damnation
this
belgium
strong
golden
ale
is
7
0
abv
has
extraordinary
aromas
of
banana
and
pear
with
mouth
filling
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
lingering
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
but
very
very
smooth
very
solid
strong
golden
ale
offering
without
being
cloying
almost
seems
as
to
have
some
wheat
and
banana
and
clove
taste
but
doesnt
offer
the
peculiarity
of
a
true
belgian
perhaps
this
is
due
to
a
colder
fermentation
almost
more
similar
to
a
german
hefe
or
old
english
ale
in
the
tastes
imparted
by
the
yeast
very
basic
malt
profile
just
enough
low
alpha
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
beautiful
beer
drinkability
is
rather
high
due
to
the
light
body
and
not
overpowering
flavors
d
a
good
bspa
russian
river
has
very
good
belgians
in
general
and
this
as
their
regular
offering
showcases
why
and
i
like
that
this
is
cheaper
yet
better
than
true
belgians
or
even
unibroue
d
complex
but
not
overwhelming
flavor
drinkability
6
ounces
in
i
wouldve
gone
higher
but
as
this
went
along
i
realized
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
of
by
yourself
probably
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
port
wine
as
its
almost
like
a
dessert
in
my
book
its
a
synergy
beer
for
sure
where
the
sum
of
the
parts
doesnt
add
up
to
its
own
entirety
but
id
love
to
have
another
bottle
on
the
shelf
for
a
given
special
occasion
as
id
imagine
itd
age
well
too
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
nice
will
be
drinking
it
again
and
again
opens
with
a
spirited
pop
that
sent
my
cork
to
an
as
of
yet
unknown
location
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
pillows
around
and
sticks
itself
to
the
entire
glass
on
the
way
down
aromas
of
sweet
bready
grain
fruity
spicy
estery
yeast
aromas
slight
pepper
tastes
of
lemon
with
a
slight
acidity
mix
in
esters
some
funk
and
spice
finishes
dry
leaves
a
spicy
funky
taste
on
the
palette
huge
lively
carbonation
slick
almost
resinous
in
the
mouth
medium
body
certainly
a
belgian
strong
pale
this
one
is
a
bit
much
for
my
taste
but
to
style
its
probably
spot
on
a
good
beer
that
i
will
not
seek
out
but
will
enjoy
if
presented
d
much
more
impressive
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
which
is
weird
for
a
belgian
beer
the
more
amazing
thing
is
all
the
ladies
and
no
experienced
beer
people
who
ordered
this
and
were
impressed
it
really
is
a
beer
with
mass
appeal
im
not
a
often
a
fancier
of
belgianstyle
beers
so
i
might
not
have
developed
the
palette
yet
to
completely
dissect
a
beer
like
this
that
said
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
not
order
again
honestly
i
am
not
sure
how
much
more
i
can
expect
from
this
style
or
what
is
it
exactly
that
i
am
looking
for
to
be
able
to
give
it
a
few
5s
maybe
after
a
couple
more
tries
i
will
have
to
revisit
o
very
good
beer
perfect
for
lays
afternoons
this
is
a
benchmark
bpa
as
good
as
if
not
better
then
the
ones
from
belgian
i
have
tried
such
wonderful
sweet
complexity
that
constantly
evolves
with
time
i
wish
this
was
accessible
in
ontario
silky
smooth
crisp
and
dry
so
easy
to
enjoy
drink
this
all
day
every
day
drinkability
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
bit
too
one
sided
for
my
tastes
but
it
still
is
a
fantastic
piece
of
work
i
had
a
pleasure
sipping
this
one
and
thankfully
have
another
bottle
i
will
enjoy
pours
out
a
cloudy
bright
orange
color
with
pillowy
white
head
leaves
some
sticky
patchy
lacing
on
the
edges
the
nose
is
fruity
and
floral
the
taste
is
very
fruity
and
flora
just
like
the
nose
there
is
bitter
hop
taste
and
som
spiciness
as
well
a
slight
yeast
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
zesty
it
kind
of
bounces
around
the
mouth
overall
this
was
pretty
good
i
nice
belgian
pale
worth
a
shot
in
my
book
overall
damnation
is
a
dry
lemony
moderately
strong
belgian
pale
ale
good
flavor
but
its
soft
and
reserved
without
a
tight
balance
to
tie
it
down
pours
a
murky
gold
with
some
orange
hues
throughout
the
offwhite
head
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
then
dissipates
leaving
a
nice
stripe
of
lace
all
around
the
snifter
with
a
few
skinny
fingers
jutting
toward
the
rim
belgian
strong
ales
always
have
an
appeasing
aesthetic
to
me
and
this
one
is
no
different
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
with
a
fruity
floral
undercurrent
some
sweet
candy
exists
as
well
tastes
fruity
and
malty
with
a
good
hop
kick
toward
the
end
some
subtle
sweet
bread
spice
and
underneath
it
all
some
sour
apples
find
their
way
out
an
almost
indiscernible
phenolic
essence
is
noted
some
notes
of
alcohol
present
themselves
as
the
beer
warms
up
mouthfeel
lies
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
and
its
fairly
highly
carbonated
making
for
a
smooth
easily
drinkable
beer
nice
one
for
sure
and
although
there
are
a
few
others
i
prefer
over
this
one
i
cant
find
any
big
faults
with
this
damnation
as
much
as
i
love
the
trappist
ales
duvel
is
still
my
favorite
belgian
ale
and
possibly
my
favorite
beer
altogether
damnation
is
the
only
beer
that
i
think
is
as
good
as
the
beer
it
is
styled
after
everything
about
it
is
similar
great
carbonation
outstanding
flavor
and
aroma
perfect
belgian
mouthfeel
the
only
difference
is
that
damnation
may
be
a
little
bit
fruitier
i
had
this
instead
of
bloody
marys
this
morning
and
it
was
a
great
choice
big
thanks
to
wastrinkensie
for
this
one
thick
bone
white
froth
on
the
pour
looks
like
you
swirled
it
with
an
egg
beater
lots
of
lacing
streaks
across
the
glass
light
bronze
orange
in
color
not
much
hue
change
towards
the
rims
clear
enough
to
se
the
pinpricks
of
bubbles
rise
upwards
sort
of
a
beery
nose
yeasts
and
raw
pie
dough
predominate
then
theres
orange
blossom
clove
stick
apricot
pits
and
pear
skins
comes
across
as
remarkably
openly
knit
and
airy
very
restrained
sweetness
mediumbodied
the
foaminess
in
the
mouth
is
gentle
however
takes
up
a
considerable
amount
of
space
before
finally
settling
down
the
clove
cinnamon
spices
offset
by
notes
of
sharper
white
pepper
in
turn
sweeter
orange
citrus
met
by
more
sour
white
grapefruit
not
a
lot
of
esters
the
apricot
pear
peach
fruit
succinct
and
dry
the
yeasts
too
are
dry
and
not
overly
leesy
and
creamy
not
bitter
on
the
finish
but
has
a
certain
astringency
which
might
throw
off
some
imbibers
almost
shy
about
its
complexity
overall
a
great
belgian
style
beer
from
a
famed
west
coast
brewer
and
it
is
delicious
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
actually
went
looking
for
bottles
of
this
and
they
are
to
be
had
only
a
case
price
was
120
thats
high
even
for
a
bspa
if
it
were
cheaper
i
would
have
a
case
in
my
cellar
great
beer
notes
a
really
fine
beer
amazing
with
the
balance
and
masking
the
abv
a
pleasure
to
have
and
something
i
will
get
whenever
i
can
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
by
russian
river
belgian
style
beers
arent
typically
my
style
but
this
was
more
than
comforting
to
my
palate
make
sure
its
served
in
a
sifter
to
get
the
full
frontal
exposure
of
this
strong
belgian
style
ale
medium
dark
honey
color
with
a
thick
white
head
lovely
citrus
and
peach
nose
flavors
are
well
integrated
fruits
and
hop
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
fully
layered
but
integrated
flavors
a
very
pleasant
drink
with
a
medium
hop
and
medium
long
finish
this
is
one
of
those
all
around
good
beers
it
becomes
a
bit
soft
and
almost
elegant
as
you
drink
it
this
beer
goes
with
almost
all
food
and
is
pretty
universally
good
pours
luminous
gold
with
slight
haze
with
generous
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
silky
thin
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
good
tripel
with
light
fruits
especially
apple
on
the
palate
the
tripel
resemblance
emerges
again
with
soft
malt
light
fruits
again
and
a
semitart
and
dry
finish
drinkability
this
is
one
very
drinkable
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
complex
well
balanced
and
invite
further
sipping
and
tasting
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
and
still
be
ready
for
more
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
little
haze
pours
with
a
lot
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
and
fruity
with
notes
of
pear
the
taste
brings
on
the
same
flavors
as
the
smell
very
smooth
good
balance
nice
smooth
hop
finish
it
is
light
and
very
carbonated
on
the
tongue
overall
damnation
has
a
great
balance
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
been
drinking
this
one
for
years
and
this
may
have
been
the
best
bottle
i
have
ever
had
the
year
and
a
half
being
aged
probably
doesnt
hurt
will
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
and
continue
to
see
how
they
age
d
i
couldnt
detect
the
7
0
abv
so
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
drinkability
i
had
to
go
easy
on
the
drinkability
score
because
damnation
was
an
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
belgian
style
ale
that
had
some
good
flavors
to
it
if
i
ever
saw
this
beer
again
would
i
buy
it
you
know
what
i
probably
would
because
i
would
like
to
see
what
a
later
batch
would
taste
like
d
it
does
taste
great
and
goes
down
like
a
champ
but
after
drinking
one
bottle
i
had
enough
d
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
without
losing
drinkability
abv
is
well
hidden
finish
is
remarkable
md
nice
carbonation
that
helped
make
this
one
seem
very
light
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
with
alot
going
on
in
flavor
i
recommend
it
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
nice
level
of
flavor
and
a
very
clean
presentation
a
solid
american
effort
at
the
belgian
style
clear
golden
color
thin
head
that
dissipates
into
nothing
fruity
yeast
smellcan
make
out
some
lemon
and
some
banana
tastes
great
very
smooth
not
what
i
was
expecting
funky
mouth
feelagain
smooth
nothing
lingers
drinkability
is
too
high
i
think
im
changing
my
mind
on
these
belgians
review
of
batch
044
pour
looks
somewhat
light
in
color
lighter
than
a
saison
almost
wit
like
but
not
murky
really
pilsner
flavor
hop
could
be
more
musky
but
a
nice
mellow
sweet
palate
is
minty
rosemary
light
dusty
walnut
bread
with
a
light
sun
tea
sweet
at
the
bottle
of
the
bottle
lemon
grass
not
as
sweet
as
la
fin
de
mod
but
not
as
complex
a
hop
character
as
i
would
like
quite
crisp
light
great
interpretation
d
this
is
damn
good
beer
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
bspa
as
i
know
them
but
that
doesnt
matter
this
is
a
dirty
nasty
funky
biatch
and
im
diggin
it
poured
a
yellowgold
with
the
amount
of
carbonation
that
makes
this
beer
look
refreshing
the
head
got
retained
in
that
stubbly
sort
of
way
leaving
lace
as
it
slowly
dissapaited
the
smell
was
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
different
spices
pepper
cloves
mixing
with
some
fruity
notes
the
taste
was
spicy
with
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
appearance
of
refreshing
held
true
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
wasnt
the
most
dense
or
complex
beer
but
it
was
a
perfect
accent
to
a
lazy
sunday
afternoon
where
something
more
complex
in
taste
might
have
offended
a
really
nice
pale
ale
d
move
over
blondes
i
have
a
new
summer
ale
i
cant
imagine
a
more
perfect
beer
on
a
hot
day
the
flavors
arent
too
overwhelming
its
great
cold
it
doesnt
leave
your
mouth
dry
nor
fill
you
up
and
the
finish
is
remarkably
clean
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
and
i
would
recommend
it
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
a
complex
yet
light
beer
it
is
not
completely
in
the
refreshing
category
but
who
needs
that
unless
youre
sitting
around
watching
the
game
and
munching
on
chips
and
guac
the
color
when
poured
was
light
golden
yellow
with
very
little
foam
but
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
sort
of
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
the
taste
had
a
sweetbitter
carbonation
on
the
palate
with
a
good
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
citrus
not
a
lot
of
favor
on
the
aftertaste
just
the
taste
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
d
dangerously
drinkable
each
sip
demands
another
so
i
can
see
what
comes
next
dvery
drinkable
this
may
be
come
a
favorite
of
mine
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
the
alcohol
is
not
so
prevalent
to
mask
the
other
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soft
but
with
a
bit
of
crispness
medium
bodied
really
nice
beer
one
of
those
that
gets
better
the
farther
into
the
bottle
you
get
well
rounded
if
not
spectacular
note
while
this
beer
is
listed
at
7
on
the
website
it
says
7
75
right
on
the
label
i
think
this
beer
is
good
not
great
except
for
its
appearance
its
much
more
dry
than
i
would
have
thought
for
a
belgian
strong
ale
maybe
thats
where
the
pale
part
comes
in
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
that
pop
i
was
hoping
for
i
found
it
to
be
quite
high
on
the
drinkability
meter
sign
me
up
for
another
even
if
it
is
a
14
bottle
around
here
drink
is
pretty
high
if
given
the
chance
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
tmd
yum
tastes
like
it
smells
light
and
slightly
fruity
and
candy
sugar
sweet
but
not
overly
so
a
bit
of
a
malty
taste
up
front
and
delicate
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
back
fantastic
id
write
more
but
this
one
is
calling
for
my
attention
drinkability
nicely
balanced
and
a
spicy
hoppy
example
of
the
style
very
nice
overall
this
is
certainly
a
very
good
staple
of
rr
worth
a
shot
great
stuff
a
solid
example
of
the
style
drinkability
very
nice
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
the
750s
alone
russian
river
almost
never
disappoints
not
even
close
to
a
clunker
in
the
bunch
very
good
after
years
of
hearing
about
rrs
beers
weve
recently
started
seeing
them
in
stores
up
here
in
the
fourth
corner
lets
see
if
they
live
up
to
their
reputation
shall
we
poured
into
chalice
poured
a
clear
bright
goldenyellow
poured
with
about
an
inch
of
bright
white
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
thin
solid
layer
that
stuck
around
for
the
duration
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
which
is
apparently
an
issue
with
some
rr
brews
a
nicely
subtle
spice
and
fruit
aroma
the
typical
spicyness
of
this
style
is
quick
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
clove
note
on
the
finish
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
as
usual
for
the
style
nicely
drinkable
while
not
on
on
the
level
of
chimay
white
or
duvel
this
is
an
acceptable
version
of
this
style
which
i
will
probably
try
again
overall
an
average
example
of
this
style
never
had
this
before
but
i
knew
this
beer
was
supposed
to
be
good
when
i
bought
it
it
didnt
disappoint
im
a
big
belgian
fan
but
pretty
much
every
american
beer
ive
ever
had
which
attempted
to
be
a
belgian
style
was
just
a
pale
imitation
not
this
one
ill
certainly
revisit
it
again
an
excellent
brew
from
our
friends
out
west
d
i
liked
it
but
r
r
has
better
that
you
can
get
but
good
noticeable
belgian
aroma
coming
off
the
devotion
distinct
belgian
spiciness
excellent
and
excellent
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
something
your
non
beer
advocates
friends
may
like
i
shared
the
bottle
with
two
friends
and
that
seemed
about
the
right
amount
of
this
hoppy
california
interpretation
of
the
style
d
would
only
have
one
a
nice
beer
but
it
doesnt
strike
me
with
anything
particular
or
fantastic
im
glad
that
alcohol
isnt
present
in
the
taste
like
many
american
attempts
at
belgian
ales
but
the
balance
between
the
fruity
smell
and
yeasty
taste
doesnt
really
merge
anywhere
d
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
and
amazing
on
tap
d
was
really
nice
to
drink
easy
going
down
delicious
d
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
for
some
reason
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
my
notes
made
it
sound
like
i
did
perhaps
i
was
just
in
a
negative
frame
of
mind
a
solid
offering
nonetheless
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
one
it
is
easy
to
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
in
a
session
but
alcohol
will
quietly
sneak
up
on
you
i
mailordered
this
one
out
of
san
diego
and
so
maybe
my
hopes
were
disproportionally
high
it
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
smells
mildly
of
apples
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointinga
mild
flavor
of
apples
and
pears
but
on
the
weak
side
carbonation
was
a
bit
on
the
weak
sidethe
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
drinkable
and
decent
but
nothing
special
ive
still
not
had
anything
from
rr
that
really
impressed
me
overall
this
is
my
first
offering
from
russian
river
and
i
was
indeed
pleased
i
ordered
this
only
knowing
that
it
was
from
rr
and
nothing
else
this
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
duvel
but
toned
down
a
notch
could
use
a
touch
more
in
flavor
but
it
paired
nicely
with
a
grilled
chicken
sandwich
with
cheese
and
portobello
mushrooms
after
a
quick
roundabout
amongst
some
fellow
brewers
standing
around
the
weekends
wort
it
was
decided
the
we
liked
this
ber
so
much
that
we
want
to
make
it
notes
this
is
very
good
beer
its
complex
crisp
wellbuilt
and
very
satisfying
a
very
good
example
of
a
bspa
tally
up
another
winner
for
russian
river
definitely
recommended
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
scant
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
somewhere
between
apricots
and
peaches
and
slightly
floral
like
orange
blossoms
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
good
hop
presence
but
not
overpowering
in
the
least
sweet
flavors
of
orange
and
honey
almost
kind
of
herby
like
savory
finish
is
nice
and
lingering
but
not
dry
or
sweet
now
i
need
to
trade
for
redemption
to
see
what
that
has
in
store
for
me
a
great
great
domestic
interpretation
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
a
nice
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
curious
about
the
belgie
experience
but
i
feel
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
after
reading
up
about
this
beer
and
its
sister
beer
redemption
and
trying
them
in
the
same
night
i
cant
see
wanting
to
reach
for
redemption
although
redemption
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
to
me
this
is
just
a
superior
version
of
it
slightly
more
robust
with
more
pronounced
flavors
and
a
slightly
higher
abv
overall
a
great
offering
from
russian
river
and
a
fine
belgian
ale
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
beers
in
their
lineup
an
easy
drinker
with
some
excellent
flavors
another
solid
beer
from
russian
river
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
id
drink
this
one
again
but
i
do
prefer
other
russian
river
beers
over
this
one
for
the
price
id
also
pick
something
up
over
it
too
but
overall
not
bad
d
somewhat
soft
carbonation
and
lack
of
any
bold
unbalanced
flavors
makes
for
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer

d
sweet
but
not
cloying
subtle
but
complex
very
tasty
feel
is
good
initially
but
the
carbonation
releases
prematurely
yielding
a
somewhat
slick
finish
that
shows
the
alcohol
rather
drinkable
nonetheless
and
probably
not
the
best
example
of
this
beer
as
i
think
the
keg
may
have
been
on
its
last
legs
serving
type
bottle
d
excellent
beer
i
probably
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
as
it
hits
pretty
hard
but
id
like
to
try
sometime
bright
golden
pour
with
cloudy
yeast
and
good
carbonation
yeast
carries
over
in
aroma
with
some
nutmeg
and
fruit
taste
is
light
for
this
kind
of
brew
malt
and
banana
kind
of
like
bread
pudding
but
with
a
crisp
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
the
star
very
smooth
and
light
drinkabilityvery
drinkable
good
tasting
beer
wheres
the
hops
jk
haha
i
tried
this
while
in
the
pac
nwnamely
the
bier
stein
in
eugene
and
i
am
really
pissed
that
i
cant
get
this
beer
out
here
in
nc
i
loved
this
brew
and
being
a
disciple
of
duvel
i
had
a
hard
time
deciding
which
was
better
the
only
thing
i
figured
was
that
i
need
more
real
world
data
after
duvel
this
is
the
best
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
i
have
had
and
i
need
to
get
omre
of
this
in
nc
d
great
drinkability
and
spicing
a
great
example
tasty
sweet
and
spicy
and
a
joy
to
consume
overall
very
good
american
example
of
a
belgian
style
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
yellow
in
color
it
only
produced
a
coating
of
a
head
with
some
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromo
was
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
was
very
floral
with
sweet
malt
flavors
a
hint
of
alcohol
does
come
through
in
fact
i
can
still
feel
the
slight
alcohol
burn
long
after
the
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
coating
the
entire
palate
the
carbonation
leaves
a
bite
on
the
tip
of
tongue
this
is
a
grwat
sipping
beer
in
the
taste
youll
get
sweet
grain
spicy
lemon
honeysuckle
and
a
slight
vienous
whitewine
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
and
is
damnnear
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgians
ive
had
the
complexity
makes
this
one
enjoyable
in
large
quanities
or
atleast
over
a
long
time
period
i
stretched
this
750ml
out
through
a
couple
hours
and
had
left
the
bottle
out
after
my
second
tulip
glass
as
it
warmed
it
got
tastier
d
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
i
marvel
at
the
way
russian
river
makes
such
complex
beers
simple
and
accessible
but
still
utterly
enjoyable
and
able
to
stand
up
with
the
best
in
any
style
taste
mouthfeel
dry
and
grainy
floral
hops
green
apple
hints
of
lemon
rind
pear
and
banana
high
carbonation
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
pleasantly
bitter
in
the
finish
and
quite
dry
i
can
understand
why
this
is
russian
rivers
flagship
belgian
style
beer
its
complex
but
very
accessible
and
well
balanced
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
yeast
and
fruit
with
alcohol
at
the
end
tastes
of
pears
and
other
fruit
flavors
this
one
finishes
very
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
an
enjoyable
brew
probably
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
me
but
pretty
tasty
overall
a
very
solid
brew
overall
good
first
experience
with
rr
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
huge
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
crisp
fruits
like
apple
banana
and
pear
as
well
as
hops
and
alcohol
very
crisp
quaffable
beer
lots
of
citrusy
lemon
and
orange
as
wll
as
apple
pear
and
banana
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
and
dry
an
amazingly
smooth
wonderful
tasting
beer
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
quickly
fading
head
that
laces
the
glass
aroma
is
spice
taste
is
pretty
gross
mix
of
fruitcoriander
and
some
other
garbage
spices
i
would
have
been
angry
if
i
had
spent
two
dollars
on
this
but
the
fact
that
i
spent
15
00
makes
me
feel
like
i
was
robbed
total
rubbish
overall
a
above
average
brew
the
taste
goes
right
along
with
the
smell
citrus
and
malty
flavor
a
little
clove
and
a
little
banana
flavor
as
well
nothing
to
totally
rock
my
world
but
a
great
overall
good
tatse
had
a
super
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
crisp
finish
and
a
little
carbonation
at
the
end
d
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
anyway
and
while
this
is
my
first
shot
at
this
beer
ontap
service
probably
hurts
its
drinkability
some
more
due
to
the
coldness
and
lack
of
head
which
detracts
from
the
aroma
and
thus
the
unique
flavor
of
a
belgian
ale
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
think
i
would
like
the
bottle
version
much
better
md
lightly
textured
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
works
really
well
with
the
flavor
here
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
would
be
interested
in
trying
again
to
see
if
my
taste
buds
were
distracted
very
well
crafted
belgian
pale
ale
high
drinkability
another
great
beer
from
vinnie
and
the
folks
at
russian
river
glowing
golden
in
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
superb
retention
steady
carbonation
and
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
glass
lightly
honey
glazed
biscuits
and
crackers
with
a
peppery
essence
earthy
hop
presence
and
light
yeast
taste
is
of
fruits
and
has
a
delicate
bitterness
some
woody
flavors
intermingle
as
well
adding
complexity
to
the
brew
apricot
and
peach
light
apple
medium
body
with
tingling
carbonation
and
a
moderate
dryness
in
the
finish
so
smooth
and
a
treat
to
drink
i
have
yet
to
find
a
russian
river
brew
that
i
didnt
enjoy
this
was
provided
as
an
extra
by
brandoman63
in
a
trade
a
while
back
thanks
beer
is
a
very
watery
yellow
color
which
hides
a
hellaciously
sweet
candied
nose
taste
is
a
mite
disappointing
after
that
like
the
color
the
taste
is
a
touch
weak
watered
down
for
a
belgian
strong
the
sweetness
is
still
there
but
the
beer
doesnt
have
the
depth
impressiveness
of
most
russian
river
brews
ive
sampled
nice
drinkability
really
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
definitely
have
this
again
the
abv
is
perfect
for
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
an
over
the
top
bspa
at
all
very
wellbalanced
soft
subtle
and
overall
very
pleasing
overall
please
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
and
arent
strapped
for
cash
mine
was
around
10
just
a
fabulous
beer
approachable
and
very
drinkable
theres
no
forcing
this
one
down
in
fact
i
found
myself
forcing
to
drink
more
slowly
excellent
in
nearly
every
regard
d
good
have
had
it
a
couple
times
and
will
continue
to
do
sopretty
sessionable
for
a
belgian
pours
a
bright
clean
gold
with
a
super
thick
and
wonderful
head
the
appearance
is
outstanding
but
my
only
knock
on
it
is
that
the
head
is
not
rocky
like
the
belgians
nevertheless
if
i
could
review
on
personal
preference
and
not
on
style
it
would
most
definitely
be
a
4
55
on
appearance
the
aroma
is
uplifting
spicy
fruity
and
a
hint
towards
a
bit
of
tartness
the
flavor
closely
mimics
the
scent
but
adds
much
more
complexity
and
character
to
the
beer
a
lot
of
citrus
hops
and
pepper
comes
through
fresh
green
grass
also
what
an
incredible
beer
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
it
is
fluffy
and
light
yet
very
complex
at
the
same
time
awesome
russian
river
keeps
amazing
me
how
do
they
do
it
d
on
the
light
side
which
makes
it
drinkable
not
my
favorite
rr
brew
but
very
tasty
nothing
quite
lives
up
to
the
salvation
on
draft
at
falling
rock
my
mouth
is
still
watering
just
thinking
about
it
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
with
some
good
carbonation
nose
is
fruity
with
yeast
taste
is
fruitycrisp
with
the
yeast
making
a
big
surprise
mouthfeel
has
medium
carbonation
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
with
the
alcohol
only
barely
noticeable
drinkability
is
good
but
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
such
a
big
deal
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
it
is
delicious
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
is
tasty
but
not
too
strong
with
an
american
touch
it
has
a
bitter
touch
that
keeps
the
sweetness
balanced
enough
a
delightful
brew
good
easy
drinking
strong
pale
ale
could
easily
knock
a
few
back
russian
river
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
yet
another
belgian
style
ale
in
all
honesty
this
beer
is
better
then
my
score
would
indicate
but
the
nose
brought
it
down
slightly
that
could
be
me
being
picky
again
though
thanks
for
the
beer
unanimous
trader
i
honestly
believe
vinny
at
russian
river
would
have
to
work
his
ass
off
to
make
a
bad
beer
ive
had
nothing
less
than
fantastic
beers
from
them
for
whatever
reason
they
have
an
uncanny
ability
to
brew
belgian
styles
that
are
rivaled
by
probably
one
other
brewer
in
the
u
s
maybe
two
once
again
this
is
another
fine
example
highly
recommended
overall
its
not
very
balanced
or
complex
its
far
too
much
towards
the
sweet
side
but
i
find
myself
liking
it
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
dont
think
itll
stand
out
in
my
mind
as
something
i
have
to
have
again
but
at
the
same
time
its
something
id
be
happy
to
revisit
when
im
craving
the
style
d
from
a
guy
who
worships
belgian
tripels
and
duvel
style
strong
pale
ales
i
am
happy
to
say
that
this
was
a
damn
good
example
in
my
opinion
this
is
among
the
best
2
or
3
american
versions
of
this
style
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
beer
with
good
complexity
to
make
it
intriguing
and
wellworth
drinking
for
a

big
and
golden
with
a
fine
head
the
beer
smells
yeasty
with
a
lot
of
sweet
fruit
the
flavor
is
ripe
banana
with
some
light
citrus
and
more
yeast
there
are
also
some
good
earthy
and
bitter
notes
to
balance
things
and
impart
that
belgian
flavor
the
flavor
is
more
complex
than
im
able
to
effectively
describe
but
i
deeply
enjoyed
the
experience
the
feel
is
spot
on
the
carbonation
brings
out
some
bright
tones
and
the
alcohol
is
welltoned
but
pleasantly
warm
its
a
very
drinkable
belgian
with
a
good
light
aftertaste
and
a
great
flavor

hugely
drinkable
and
a
favorite
at
the
pub
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
american
attempts
at
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
that
ive
sampled
thus
far
kudos
to
russian
river
pours
cloudy
light
apricot
long
lasting
and
puffy
eggshell
white

lots
of
nice
looking
lace
on
the
glass
nose
of
tropical
fruits
wheaty
malts
and
grainy
hops
yasty
complex
thoroughly
enjoyable
offering
notes
of
more
fresh
fruits
belgian
yeasties
gobs
of
drying
hops
all
over
the
place
love
the
rr
creations
only
problem
is
you
cant
get
em
in
the
nyctnjmavtnh
area
but
philly
sometimes
gets
em
drinkability
solid
but
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
like
pliny
still
a
great
brew
i
cant
wait
to
see
more
russian
river
come
out
this
way
if
and
when
it
does
happen
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
too
bad
russian
river
doesnt
distribute
here
i
would
have
a
new
go
to
beer
for
chicken
dinners
and
lighter
pork
meals
rr
seems
to
live
up
to
the
hype
i
havent
had
a
mediocre
let
alone
bad
brew
from
them
yet
recommended
as
one
of
the
best
american
depictions
of
this
particular
belgian
style
you
should
try
it
but
dont
expect
a
revolutionary
beer
just
a
rewarding
and
delicious
one
d
this
is
another
great
bspa
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
am
sad
that
i
cant
get
this
in
my
area
though
there
are
examples
i
like
better
both
rr
brews
i
have
had
are
in
the
top
5
for
the
style
for
me
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trading
for
more
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
offering
is
just
a
step
below
the
real
standouts
i
feel
like
its
a
little
too
bready
and
i
could
have
gone
for
a
little
more
booze
that
said
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
rr
bev
another
stellar
rrbc
product
this
one
is
an
everyday
drinker
thankfully
the
bay
area
has
plenty
of
bars
that
stock
it
pretty
good
but
seems
like
its
lacking
in
carbonation
for
a
belgian
style
ale
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
yelloworange
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
dissipated
quite
quickly
and
left
spotty
lacing
on
my
glass
i
get
a
good
dose
of
fruit
in
the
nose
including
apples
pears
oranges
and
some
belgian
style
yeast
in
the
nose
the
fruit
is
the
most
dominant
flavor
in
the
flavor
profile
with
pears
and
apple
being
the
main
players
and
there
are
also
flavors
of
lemon
pepper
and
a
slight
hint
of
banana
as
well
the
mouthfeel
has
medium
carbonation
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
with
the
alcohol
only
barely
noticeable
the
drinkability
is
quite
nice
even
at
7
75
and
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
was
that
high
if
i
didnt
read
it
on
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
meaty
with
a
strong
bite
of
carbonation
that
highlights
the
citruslike
bitterness
d
ill
easily
enjoy
this
bomber
myself
dont
think
i
could
open
another
one
in
the
same
nite
but
i
would
think
to
buy
more
also
very
ironic
that
salvation
is
dark
and
damnation
is
light
irony
anyone
overall
pretty
good
prosit

pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
not

all

but
excellent
for
mixing
things
up
and
introducing
people
to
craft
belgian
beer
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
while
i
had
the
intention
of
just
giving
it
a
try
i
know
now
i
will
have
to
remember
to
pick
this
up
in
the
future
i
figured
damnation
would
be
appropriate
on
the
eve
of
the
large
hadron
colliders
debut
and
these
crazy
scientists
trying
to
find
the
god

if
we
do
get
sucked
into
a
black
hole
all
i
know

out

ill
probably
give
it
another

could

pretty

i
got
a

nice
golden

with

it
smells
like
faint
hints
of
banana
bubblegum
esters
belgian
very
nice
nice
flavors
that
diverge
from
the
nose
but
are
hard
to
describe
a
dryness
that
works
well
easy
to
drink
but
i
will
still
sip
it
because
i
want
to
savor
the
whole
bottle
bspa
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
id
still
prefer
a
salvation
or
perdition
but
this
was
well
worth
the
5
per
bottle
it
will
be
interesting
to
taste
this
again
in
a
year
or
two
you
know
to
be
honest
considering
the
hype
i
was
expecting
a
tad
more
drinkablity
is
damn
good
as
much
as
i
love
belgian
blondes
im
frankly
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
simpler
spicy
duvel
style
bspas
but
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
and
has
really
won
me
over
only
my
2nd
belgian
style
russian
river
and
4th
of
theirs
over
all
and
i
have
to
say
im
a
real
believer
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
clean
excellent
offering
overall
this
is
the
first
rr
beer
that
i
have
tried
and
i
am
impressed
damnation
is
a
great
bspa
that
stands
up
to
some
of
the
better
originals
from
belgium
recommended
taste
is
pretty
light
some
belgian
yeast
some
butter
and
a
bit
of
citrus
but
it
is
pretty
muted
i
dont
get
a
heck
of
alot
from
this
beer
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
though
i
dont
think
i
would
search
it
out
to
do
it
again
i
did
have
this
beer
right
after
i
had
a
saison
atheneiwhich
was
incredible
and
very
fullflavored
so
it
may
be
a
bit
unfair
the
folks
at
russian
river
definitely
tried
to
put
an
american
twist
on
a
belgian
style
ale
and
they
did
it
very
poorly
this
beer
lacked
severely
in
almost
all
categories
definitely
one
of
the
most
disappointing
brews
i
have
tried
in
a
while
hv
a
nice
sour
flavor
with
much
complexity
its
like
liquid
bred
poured
into
a
wine
glass
only
thing
avalable
at
my
cousens
house
a
two
fingered
head
formed
and
slowley
disapated
the
beer
was
a
rich
popcorn
kernal
yellow
with
much
sedement
floating
around
in
this
one
this
one
hides
the
aolchol
well
i
like
golden
monkey
better
but
this
one
is
good
i
have
to
thank
wastrinkensie
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
drinkability
got
through
the
whole
bottle
there
and
it
was
very
good
the
effect
this
had
on
my
palate
was
similar
to
the
effect
that
stones
ruination
had
that
is
to
say
made
everything
taste
a
little
more
bland
right
after
drinking
it
making
me
mutter
to
myself
damn
in
a
good
way
d
a
good
bspa
but
the
amount
yeast
character
can
get
in
the
way
at
times
its
kind
of
the
allagash
white
of
this
style
still
its
a
good
version
and
quite
cheap
compared
to
belgian
versions
at
the
store
kudos
to
vinnie
cilurzo
and
the
rr
gang
for
brewing
some
of
the
greatest
tasting
beers
around
aside
from
sheer
alcoholic
strength
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
fantastic
balance
and
a
superbly
dry
finish
sweet
malts
spicy
phenols
and
fruity
esters
marry
together
perfectly
perhaps
a
tad
more
bitterness
would
push
this
to
an
a
this
to
me
is
a
beer
in
two
parts
the
initial
first
smell
was
west
coast
hops
and
the
taste
reflected
a
hoppy
presence
as
the
beer
warmed
up
and
opened
up
the
belgian
notes
came
to
the
front
and
the
hops
seemed
to
drop
off
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
full
of
lots
of
complex
flavours
including
citrus
dried
fruit
and
yeast
very
well
made
and
unlike
any
other
example
of
the
style
perhaps
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
given
the
fantastic
things
ive
heard
about
russian
river
but
thats
an
expectations
problem
not
a
beer
problem
this
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian
pa
which
is
always
a
style
i
enjoy
seeing
domestic
breweries
pull
off
and
this
one
is
pulled
off
well
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
if
you
see
any
russian
river
pick
it
up
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
goes
well
with
fowl
and
game
again
since
it
is
high
abv
it
will
put
you
on
your
bottom
after
one
bottle
from
a
cagedcorked
750
batch
36
just
an
absolutely
beautiful
beer
deep
golden
and
somewhat
cloudy
a
tremendous
head
that
takes
awhile
to
dissapate
and
as
it
does
it
leaves
beautiful
chunky
lacing
all
over
the
inside
of
my
glass
smell
is
of
belgian
spices
and
some
pears
and
light
hops
too
taste
is
follows
up
the
smells
with
more
yeasty
belgian
spice
up
front
followed
by
some
ripe
green
apples
and
pears
on
the
finish
a
nice
bittering
hop
flavor
pokes
through
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
bodied
more
so
than
other
bspas
perhaps
with
a
very
creamy
feel
to
it
maybe
a
little
less
carbonation
than
duvel
or
delirium
tremens
very
drinkable
cleans
off
the
palate
well
nothing
out
of
balance
to
slow
you
down
right
up
there
with
duvel
and
better
than
delirium
tremens
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
belgian
pa
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
very
drinkable
because
of
the
excellent
balance
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
i
expected
and
more
than
the
style
normally
indicates
the
other
aspects
are
all
there
but
not
as
pronounced
as
i
had
hoped
it
finishes
very
very
clean
and
doesnt
linger
at
all
the
alcohol
isnt
completely
masked
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
it
the
body
is
a
little
fuller
than
most
belgian
strong
pales
but
the
carbonation
helps
to
lighten
it
up
a
bit
and
still
gives
it
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
fantastic
light
bodied
but
not
thin
with
ample
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
but
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
as
my
first
exposure
to
russian
river
the
taste
is
nice
fruity
orange
tangerine
bitter
earthy
spices
bread
grass
tangy
citrus
bite
that
finishes
soft
crisp
dry
and
very
spicy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
russian
river
i
hope
to
have
more
access
to
some
more
of
their
stuff
d
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
found
it
more
enjoyable
as
i
drank
it
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
at
first
and
then
finishes
bitter
it
seems
sweeter
in
the
aroma
than
it
is
on
the
tongue
great
complex
flavor
profile
here
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
not
overly
clovey
or
spiced
spicing
is
nicely
done
and
this
beer
would
make
for
an
ok
session
thanks
to
dbatch
and
our
ca
friend
for
hooking
up
a
shipment
of
limited
release
russian
river
to
the
east
coast
750ml
bottle
marked
batch
36
pours
a
creamy
gold
color
with
a
big
soapy
head
even
with
a
slow
pour
recedes
steadily
to
leave
a
nice
surface
film
and
lacing
the
aroma
up
front
is
an
almost
winelike
sweet
fruit
bouquet
behind
that
there
was
citrus
and
hops
the
taste
was
quite
complex
i
was
curious
why
the
site
listed
this
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
the
rr
label
showed
belgian
golden
ale
there
are
definitely
characteristics
of
each
the
fruits
and
spices
from
a
golden
ale
are
there
and
the
more
than
expected
hops
pushed
it
more
towards
the
pale
ale
spectrum
although
i
would
agree
with
the
brewers
this
is
a
unique
golden
ale
it
is
bottle
fermented
for
a
little
extra
carb
but
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
fairly
smooth
with
just
a
little
bite
nice
warm
alcoholhops
aftertaste
i
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
if
they
werent
so
hard
to
get
where
i
am
very
solid
offering
from
the
guys
at
rr
overall
a
very
good
beer
relatively
mild
nose
and
flavor
smooth
and
dry
its
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
dont
quite
know
where
to
categorize
this
to
me
it
skews
close
to
the
belgian
ipa
category
either
way
i
consider
it
very
drinkable
my
first
russian
river
beer
is
not
disappointing
nice
mouthfeel
nothing
great
very
drinkable
a
bit
sour
i
like
this
but
want
to
try
others
from
this
maker
not
my
favorite
of
this
type
but
good
d
very
drinkable
but
not
completely
deadon
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
rr
experience
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
brew
solid
belgian
style
but
a
still
a
little
too
much
body
for
a
golden
ale
d
a
good
beer
to
try
but
its
not
one
i
get
excited
about
anymore

liberal
sips

just

towards
the
end
of
the
glass
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
thick
heavy
lacing
the
smell
was
typical
of
a
strong
pale
there
were
light
fruits
apples
and
grapes
with
some
sweet
malt
and
honey
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
with
a
grassy
hops
presence
that
was
a
little
overpowering
the
balance
between
hops
and
fruity
malts
was
not
put
together
well
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
with
good
carbonation
and
definitely
drinkable

had
it

with
some

a

character
hint
of
dusty

in
the

overall
not
stellar
but
good
a

shows
a

of

it
hosts
a
massive
three

off

some
scattered
lace
as
it
slowly
fades

is
very
soft
and
subtle
with
hints
of
yeast
raw
wheat
deep
citrus
and
sweet
hops
as
you
tade
first
sip
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
spicey
richness
that
is
both
creamy
and
bold
i
am
amazed
at
the
fullness
and
balance
of
this
beer
for
a
golden
ale
it
really
blows
my
expectations
out
of
the
water
nice
even
spicey
sweetness
has
notes
of
cinnamon
pepper
and
sweet
dough
mwllow
phelonic
tones
are
also
carried
throughout
a
bit
of
hop
presence
is
noticeable
in
the
backround
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
ultimately
refreshing
this
is
wonderfully
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
well
done
beer
and
one
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
not
exceptional
in
any
particular
way

very
good

with

yeast
and
bottled
on

instead
of
conditioning
with

yeast
like
most
batches
of
damnation
they
finished
this
one
with
the
same
abbey
yeast
it
pours
a
nice
solid
gold
hue
and
appears
unfiltered
but
it
could
just
be
some
yeast
particulates
the
beer
has
adequate
carbonation
and
is
capped
with
three

that
deposits
lots
of
lacing
sweet
and
toasted
malts
in
the
nose
sprinkled
with
flashes
of
orange
banana
and
perhaps
some
pineapple
on
the

its
the

with

ibus
the
beer
has
a
slightly
musty
character
along
with
some
yeast
a
touch
of
clovey
phenolics
apples
and
a
late
citric
quality
that
imparts
oranges
and
light
lemon
medium
to
full
body
with
tingly
carbonation
and
a
dry
lingering
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
which
is
great
for
the
palate
but
at
9
bucks
a
bottle
is
a
pain
on
the
wallet
although
i
havent
tried
this
beer
fresh
i
feel
the
aging
has
had
a
positive
effect
on
this
brew
definitely
a
brew
worth
visiting
and
revisiting
very
worthwhile
the
body
is
sweet
up
front
but
does
dry
out
as
you
finish
although
probably
could
have
finished
a
little
bit
more
the
carbonation
is
a
high
even
for
style
and
accentuates
some
of
the
hop
bitterness
the
wine
characteristics
are
nice
and
add
a
new
characteristics
i
do
have
a
bottle
and
plan
to
age
but
on
tap
this
is
a
great
beer
bottle
said
this
was
actually
7
75
abv
first
time
i
have
tried
russian
rivers
staple
beer
pretty
much
what
i
expected
recommended
even
though
i
think
a
lot
of
their
other
beers
are
better
would
drink
again
nice
american
twist
on
a
belgian
ale
damnation
the
name
basically
sums
it
all
up
this
beer
has
all
of
the
duvel
and
leffe
components
but
in
a
much
more
aggresively
malted
hopped
and
fermented
way
its
basically
amped
up
pale
belgian
the
difference
here
is
that
the
balance
remains
firm
and
unwaivering
a
very
tart
belgian
berrylike
vineous
chardonay
flavor
is
balanced
with
big
perfumy
hop
additions
and
a
soft
nectarlike
quality
kinda
like
youd
expect
to
find
in
a
mead
then
throw
in
some
peppery
spices
basic
pilsner
maltiness
and
fresh
tropical
fruits
pineapples
apricots
mangos
and
folks
we
have
a
super
complex
beer
quite
dry
and
warm
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
numbing
effect
not
that
its
better
than
those
beers
metioned
before
but
its
a
good
choice
if
you
want
more
strength
with
a
similar
profile
but
dont
want
to
sacrifice
unnecessay
fusals
or
phenols
overall
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
way
too
complex
to
be
this
drinkable
this
beer
is
dry
but
the
hops
really
amplify
that
dryness
but
i
didnt
notice
anything
bad
about
these
hops
this
was
super
clean
all
the
way
around
it
has
a
great
fresh
hop
character
as
well
i
could
have
said
much
more
about
this
beer
if
i
wasnt
enjoying
it
so
much
they
must
have
used
a
saison
yeast
for
this
but
it
covers
a
range
far
broader
than
duvel
to
dupont
to
symposium
i
loved
2004
symposium
but
this
is
far
better
in
my
book
enjoy
d
not
the
most
drinkable
as
i
really
enjoyed
the
overall
taste
i
was
really
full
after
just
a
few
sips
d
for
me
this
was
a
moderatetovery
drinkable
ale
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
the
initial
fruit
notes
were
nicely
offset
by
the
hops
almost
too
much
for
me
but
i
was
able
to
finish
her
off
without
too
much
effort
i
hope
to
try
more
russian
river
beers
in
the
future
drinks
easy
a
nice
american
hop
slant
on
the
style
that
doesnt
go
too
far
complexity
the
style
slowed
me
down
a
bit
my
highest
rated
beer
this
style
very
soft
and
mellow
mouthfeel
with
fluffy
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
extremely
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
brew
from
the
moment
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
and
saw
the
beautiful
color
and
bountiful
head
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
treat
i
would
absolutely
love
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
top
notch
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
spicy
peppery
and
herbal
hops
balanced
well
by
a
nice
bready
malt
presence
the
fruity
yeast
character
shines
through
super
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
a
fairly
spicy
dry
finish
carbonation
is
spot
on
its
a
hell
of
a
beer
this
one
im
privileged
to
have
tried
it
bottle
from
coit
liquors
in
san

a
glowing

with
a

banana
and

i
describing

here
sweet
bubblegum
flavour
with
honey
and
cinnamon
good
level
of
carbonation
and
a
great
body
round
off
a
solid
brew
d
i
dont
think
this
is
anything
to
rave
about
a
bit
to
strong
on
the
bananas
with
no
other
fruit
to
balance
it
out
d
insanely
drinkable
the
750ml
was
no
problem
need
to
get
some
of
this
out
in
nj
this
matched
what
i
had
hoped
for
and
as
a
person
not
locked
into
the
belgian
style
this
is
such
a
pleasure
i
may
soon
be
more
hooked
on
this
what
a
great
representation
d
this
was
my
first
from
russian
river
and
i
very
much
look
forward
to
more

coating

is
pale

spices
which
is
replicated
in
the
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
ohso
smooth
and
drinkability
is
tantalizing
always
glad
to
revisit
this
one
hasnt
lost
much
if
anything
in
its
later
iterations
try
if
you
can
d
great

dangerously

ended
up
having
two
more
immediately
after
tasting

one

a

is

off
mellow
and
sweet
with
a
different
than
usual
alcohol
flavor
to
it
on
the
end
i
get
an
earthy
flavor
no
doubt
from
the
yeast

is
slightly
bubbly
extremely
drinkable
d

would
very
easily
become
a
staple
in
the
cellar
if
easier
to
obtain
o
i
think
this
may
be
the
best
belgian
style
beer
ive
had
certainly
right
up
there
with
the
chimay
grand
reserve
the
flavor
is
complex
but
easy
to
drink
the
dryness
leaves
you
wanted
more
and
for
such
strong
flavor
the
alcohol
is
really

with

some

when

brought
the

to

the

tasted

i
had
expected
but
the
malts
left
a
creamy
feel
on
my
palate
with
subtle

notes
the
entire
time
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
high
as
my
friend
and
i
ordered
two
more
during
the
night
overall
very

i
thought
this
was

fantastic
my

goodie
from

i
can
see
why
people
pine
over
these

they
do

pliny
showed
me
that
anyway
this
was
a
fine
example
of
both
the

would

better

d
fairly
drinkable
brew
that
tastes
quite
a

better
when
it
warms
up
i
made
the
mistake
of
starting
off
with
it
fairly
cold
and
was
disappointed
but
as
it
warmed
i
liked
it
more
and
more
this
is
my
first
russian
river
brew
and
needless
to
say
im
impressed
and
desiring
more
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
there
were
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
it
like
the
nose
suggests
nevertheless
very
good
brew
that
id
be
glad
to
have
again
russian

to
have
trouble
putting

this
is
about

a
750ml
corked

into
my

it
opened
with
a
very
loud
pop
it
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
carb
fountain
in
the
center
it
had
a
good
sized
white
head
that
settled
into
a
constant
thin
film
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
spices
with
fruit
and
malt
in
the
back
really
liked
the
smell
on
this
one
the
spices
reminded
me
of
a
saison
the
taste
was
pretty
good
and
had
a
good
spicy
bite
but
the
alcohol
was
just
a
little
too
prevalent
figured
the
spices
would
mask
it
more
but
was
there
in
the
aftertaste
didnt
kill
it
but
kept
the
score
down
a
5
pt
for
me
mouthfeel
was
good
with
right
amount
of
carb
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
that
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
the
bspa
style
for
me
for
now
is
one
that
i
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
enjoy
as
opposed
to
a
drink
it
anytime
style
with
that
said
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
every
so
often

is
not
present
in
the
taste
nor
in
the
aroma
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
falls
short
of
the
best
although
its
obviously
going
up
against
some
very
stiff
competition
i
did
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
this
and
damnation
they
both
had
the
same
amber
straw
colored
body
with
a
bit
of
white
head
the
aroma
on
the
damnation
has
a
bit
more
hop
profile
than
the
redemption
there
is
also
a
good
malt
profile
and
a
slight
yeast
funk
it
has
a
good
malty
slightly
sweet
taste
with
good
hop
bitterness
and
some
flavor
as
well
perhaps
slighly
sweeter
than
the
redemption
both
are
good
beers
though
and
i
cant
choose
a
favorite
drinkability
is
high
for
the
style
the
alcohol
factor
is
there
but
it
doesnt
make
it
hard
to
envision
the
further
exploration
of
the
lively
flavors
d
yes
an
exceptional
version
of
a
very
likable
style
a
spoton
version
of
the
best
of
the
belgians
of
thhis
style
perfectly
balancing
malt
spice
and
dry
hoppiness
i
could
drink
this
regularly
an
excellent
way
to
end
a
visit
to
the
famed
toronado
overall
i
think
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
definitely
find
this
and
spend
an
evening
drinking
it
d
very
drinkable
very
tasty
last
swigs
reminds
me
a
little
of
orval
with
less
leathery
funk
excellent
drinker
that
is
supreme
with
virtually
any
food
less
peppery
than
a
duvel
thanks
to
drseamus
for
the
trade
it
may
not
quite
be
up
to
snuff
with
bos
keun
or
duvel
but
this
heres
a
fine
beer
that
deserves
plenty
of
kudos
probably
the
best
american
attempt
at
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
batch
012
it
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
orange
highlights
the
head
was
white
with
a
nice
size
until
my
hotel
glass
killed
it
yeasty
bready
smell
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
a
little
pepper
spiciness
the
taste
starts
out
doughy
with
hints
of
pepper
lemon
and
orange
the
carbonation
is
perfect
it
really
lets
the
flavors
linger
and
mix
on
my
tougue
and
then
gives
a
dry
refreshing
finish
it
is
very
drinkable
the
driness
makes
me
want
more
bottle
courtesy
of
moejuck
poured
a
deep
yellowwhitish
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
some
great
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
pear
is
quite
intense
with
some
light
spices
and
light
candy

definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
interesting
and
particular
taste
is
dominated
by
the
pear
and
even
peach
like
taste
with
some
subtle
spice
in
the
background
and
nice
creamy
texture
body
is
above
average
with
some
low
filtration
and
some
adequate
carbonation
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
overall
for
my
own
taste
but
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
exceptional
american
brewed
belgian
ale
definately
one
of
the
best
complexity
and
drinkability
make
this
a
pure
pleasure
to
drink
cheers
nicely
carbonated
runs
from
creamy
to
a
tad
prickly
very
good
drinker
i
should
of
bought
more
of
these
when
i
saw
them
went
down
very
easy
on
a
warm
afternoon
the
pour
seemed
lightly
darker
this
time
a
slightly
more
rich
gold
color
rocky
frothy
head
is
still
fantastic
fruity
and
very
earthy
belgian
yeast
nose
this
batch
should
be
very
close
to
the
017
d
extremely
drinkable
the
7
75
might
catch
up
to
you
but
not
very
quickly
or
at
least
in
my
case
i
love
it
poured
into
my
damnation
tulip
glass
that
i
ordered
avec
beer
lovely
straw
colored
golden
hue
head
was
nice
and
full
aroma
sweet
belgian
candi
sugar
taste
and
mouthfeel
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
belgian
candi
rolling
off
the
tongue
light
and
fruity
some
white
grape
and
subdued
wood
finishes
dry
with
a
hint
of
hops
upon
futher
reflection
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
some
booze
present
there
is
a
touch
of
sourness
but
quite
minimal
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
great
american
brewer
d
it
seems
that
the
name
of
the
game
with
this
beer
is
nuance
subtlety
and
balance
this
is
so
good
it
commands
you
to
keep
sipping
it
from
the
glass
what
a
fantastic
beer
courtesy
of
chris
at
ebenezers
pub
this
was
a
750ml
bottle
batch
020
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
gold
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
and
a
little
lacing
a
fruity
aroma
mainly
banana
much
more
interesting
taste
banana
pear
and
a
citrus
tang
with
some
warming
spice
coming
in
later
fairly
substantial
for
a
7
abv
this
is
a
very
good
beer
dpretty
good
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
share
with
my
easter
dinner
guests
from
a
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
purchased
from
the
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
and
consumed
just
two
days
later
so
much
for
aging
bottle
conditioned
so
you
have
to
decant
it
fairly
carefully
it
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
to
orange
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
settled
fairly
fast
and
left
moderate
lacing
nose
is
first
banana
and
then
a
swirl
of
the
glass
brings
forth
citrus
spices
and
flowers
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
flavors
mirror
the
nose
only
a
little
more
muted
than
you
might
expect
finish
shows
a
hint
of
the
hops
and
brings
a
nice
bitterness
and
again
the
fruits
come
into
play
a
very
good
belgian
ale
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
slant
on
a
belgian
golden
ale
d
quite
tasty
and
one
id
have
again
all
in
all
great
beer
from
russian
river
drinkability
is
great
its
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
is
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
7
abv
beer
yet
another
winner
from
russian
river
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
nicely
balanced
sweet
but
dry
with
a
low
enough
abv
to
make
it
sessionable
if
only
i
could
find
more
my
best
advice
if
sharing
with
a
friend
throw
a
little
of
the
yeast
into
each
others
glass
it
really
helps
balance
the
flavor
imo
d
this
is
my
first
russian
river
beer
and
this
brewery
lives
up
to
its
impressive
reputation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
smooth
belgium
strong
ale
with
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
fruit
spices
and
hops
very
pleasing
aftertaste
that
is
refreshing
but
short
high
carbonation
is
the
only
knock
on
this
fine
ale
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
with
a
light
carbonation
it
almost
comes
off
a
bit
lighter
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
for
me
its
almost
a
little
too
fruity
otherwise
this
is
a
really
good
beer
d
this
is
my
first
beer
from
russian
river
and
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
my
second
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
dont
think
id
guess
it
was
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
it
leans
a
bit
more
toward
the
bitterearthygrassy
saison
camp
not
fully
mind
youits
not
a
saison
but
it
definitely
has
some
saisonlike
characteristics
nice
beer
of
the
russian
river
beers
ive
tried
this
is
perhaps
the
least
intriguing
but
the
most
approachable
good
solid
stuff
but
their
reputation
has
preceded
them
in
the
way
that
i
expect
oddball
avant
garde
beers
every
time
still
its
capital
good
to
know
that
these
folks
can
make
a
super
solid
drinkin
beer
for
the
beer
geek
id
happily
drink
this
again
drinkability
is
quite
good
with
a
more
modest
abv
and
smooth
refreshment
it
offers
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
excellent
example
of
the
style
quite
crisp
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
nice
and
complex
with
a
decent
body
as
i
suspected
this
is
a
great
food
beer
i
can
just
image
a
midday
snack
with
some
peppered
crackers
and
aged
cheese
huh
so
good
im
so
depressed
i
cant
get
this
stuff
in
chicago
looks
like
i
might
have
to
trade
for
a
case
needless
to
say
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
style
strong
pale
if
you
can
get
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
verdict
lived
up
to
and
exceeded
my
expecations
i
really
loved
the
as
i
put
it
in
my
notes
tropical
but
not
quite
flavors
of
many
different
fruits
that
were
kept
in
check
by
the
yeasty
flavors
outstanding
cheers
edit
i
originally
labelled
the
batch
as
002
when
it
really
is
011
it
has
been
updated
accordingly
pours
a
clear
golden
huge
white
head
nice
lacing
and
excellent
retention
what
i
like
to
see
from
a
belgian
style
smell
is
sweet
honey
yeast
citrus
very
nice
lots
of
complexity
taste
is
honey
toffee
bready
yeast
spices
some
vanilla
bit
of
funky
goodness
nice
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
nice
shot
at
the
style
enjoyed
more
than
most
belgian
pales
thanks
for
hooking
us
up
jay
a
very
good
belgian
golden
here
i
love
the
banana
and
peach
flavors
in
it
also
the
carbonation
isnt
overkill
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
too
often
beers
of
this
style
have
far
too
much
carbonation
which
intereferes
with
tasting
it
properly
a
recommended
belgianstyle
golden
ale
for
sure
overall
im
reminded
again
of
duvel
this
time
because
the
taste
seems
to
recall
a
wilder
freaky
inbred
third
cousin
of
that
beer
it
does
seem
to
lack
that
certain
something
to
push
it
over
the
top
into
the
realms
of
the
belgian
ales
it
aspires
to
like
a
wilder
yeast
strain
but
its
still
good
stuff
and
being
my
first
russian
river
beer
id
easily
buy
more
from
these
folks
drinkability
very
sippable
despite
the
alcohol
detection
overall
a
good
go
for
my
firstever
bottled
rr
brew
ive
heard
so
much
about
vinces
ales
and
considering
this
is
the
most
readily
available
and
arguably
one
of
less
favored
of
his
offerings
i
must
say
its
pretty
darn
impressive
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
would
certainly
put
it
in
the
category
with
orval
the
flavor
is
mild
and
clean
with
a
wealth
of
complexity
deep
within
the
beer
that
certainly
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
and
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
if
i
get
the
opportunity
pours
yellow
golden
color
and
i
swear
as
it
was
coming
out
of
the
bottle
there
was
a
pink
color
to
it
like
a
blush
wine
small
white
head
but
it
maintains
nicely
its
bolstered
by
the
steady
flow
of
carbonation
off
the
bottom
of
my
chimay
glass
smell
and
taste
are
full
of
apple
very
faint
pepper
taste
that
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
very
dry
finish
from
what
i
recall
not
as
bold
and
fruity
as
the
other
russian
rivers
ive
had
but
certainly
very
enjoyable
a
rr
is
always
worth
trying
and
ive
never
been
disappointed
have
a
happy
new
year
bottle
split
with
dirtylou
on
my
3rd
stay
in
mad
town
drinkability
high
poured
out
a
golden
yellow
about
90
head
at
first
with
a
white
chunky
bubbly
white
head
mmm
lacing
like
crazy
all
over
this
house
the
nose
is
malt
and
belgian
spice
a
bit
of
citrus
even
some
hearty
yeast
the
taste
had
hops
alcohol
pine
yeast
spice
light
fruit
malt
and
honey
has
a
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
very
tiny
prickly
bubbly
sensation
nearly
clear
straw
yellow
colour
with
a
dense
white
cap
of
foam
the
fine
bubbles
clung
to
the
glass
producing
thick
lace
and
the
head
retention
was
quite
good
the
aroma
was
mostly
sweet
malts
with
notes
of
citrus
bread
and
spice
mild
flavour
with
a
low
bitterness
spicy
sweet
malts
and
lemony
citrus
low
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
very
tasty
mellow
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
delicious
amazing
could
have
this
every
day
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
semisweet
for
the
most
part
with
a
light
mild
bitter
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
full
and
rich
but
the
drinkability
was
hindered
by
the
strangeness
of
the
brew
i
applaud
the
brewers
tenacity
but
for
me
the
hoppiness
and
the
belgian
sweetness
did
not
mesh
good
beer
and
interesting
aggressively
stylized
this
is
no
duvel
copy
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
its
worth
getting
your
hands
on
one
music
bette
middler
im
not
joking
i
had
wind
beneath
my
wings
stuck
in
my
head
after
hearing
it
on
a
tv
show
thanks
to
dogfooddog
for
sending
this
i
am
very
thrilled
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
among
other
quality
california
brews
april
the
smell
is
great
with
a
rich
spiciness
and
some
cedar
and
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
nicet
with
a
banana
flavor
stepping
forward
as
it
warms
unfortunately
the
taste
score
was
affected
by
the
fact
the
hops
are
too
prevalent
especially
for
the
style
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
wouldnt
hurt
but
its
a
fine
tasting
beer
with
a
pleasant
but
unremarkable
mouthfeel
drinkable
certainly
but
wont
find
its
way
onto
my
desert
island
list
drinkability
went
down
really
nice
if
somebody
else
was
buying
i
would
have
another
bottle
but
at
13
bar
price
ill
go
home
content
that
i
got
to
sample
another
excellent
beer
from
vinnie
at
rr
drinkability
i
doubt
id
reach
for
this
again
anytime
soon
as
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
fired
up
about
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
active
a
zesty
foamy
champagnelike
texture
however
it
was
not
too
much
it
was
just
right
polished
brass
pillowy
tall
eggshell
colored
foam
that
splotches
the
glass
with
big
bubbled
lace
and
curtains
of
fine
veils
rushing
lane
of
fine
bubbled
carbonation
fruity
aromas
of
pear
washed
cloves
lemon
pith
and
a
splash
of
alcohol
as
well
as
a
touch
of
fresh
honey
sweet
honey
glazed
banana
slices
as
well
as
some
pear
flesh
leads
into
a
light
clove
candied
orange
peel
and
pepper
finish
possessing
that
fine
bubbled
rr
carbonation
this
is
a
touch
sweet
up
front
before
drying
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
the
spiciness
accumulates
on
the
tongue
before
rushing
down
the
throat
all
at
once
but
still
remains
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
lightness
to
it
the
honey
sweetness
is
not
at
all
cloying
i
was
surprised
that
this
had
not
dried
out
more
over
the
last
18
months
i
am
wondering
if
prehaps
the
tap
was
a
bit
off
and
i
didnt
get
a
good
sample
of
the
beer
a
very
mediocre
offering
from
a
great
brewery
i
was
dissapointed
in
this
6
50
pint
very
complex
but
hard
for
me
to
describe
a
perfect
belgium
this
is
my
frist
experience
with
russian
river
definitly
wont
be
the
last
d
this
beer
has
the
complexity
flavors
of
a
strong
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
dry
notes
the
hops
are
really
kicked
up
but
they
are
well
blended
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
and
give
it
more
depth
in
the
malts
perhaps
that
is
why
they
call
this
damnation
and
not
salvation
oelergud
very
solid
beer
all
around
great
american
example
of
a
belgian
style
beer
i
was
hoping
to
score
some
pliny
while
out
here
in
norcal
but
it
looks
like
damnation
is
all
the
rrbc
im
going
to
get
this
brew
certainly
did
not
disappoint
i
noted
a
little
demerit
for
mouthfeel
something
about
astringency
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
could
go
for
a
few
pints
of
this
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
die
lots
of
fruit
in
the
nose
along
with
a
good
amount
of
spicy
yeast
taste
begins
lightly
sweet
with
fruity
notes
of
banana
and
apple
followed
by
yeasty
bread
dough
and
spice
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
in
a
dry
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
very
tasty
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
flavor
was
overly
sweet
while
it
was
still
cold
from
the
refrigerator
other
flavors
such
a
a
citrus
and
something
akin

out

this

pours
a

poured
correctly
the
smell
is
sweet
much
like
a
tripel
with
the
same
spices
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
bit
awkward
much
like
a
tripel
with
the
same
spices
and
carbonation
but
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
body
which
makes
it
hard
to
really
get
a
grasp
on
another
of
my
beer
drinking

called
it
simple
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
lack
of

the

is

with

bitter
flavor
well
done
let
me
first
say
that
my
rating
is
biased
by
nostalgia
for
the
first
time
i
had
ozzy
the
predecessor
the
beazly
in
baltimore
md
i
was
at
a
fantastic
bar
and
was
interested
in
the
local
brews
and
choose
the
ozzy
based
solely
on
the
type
of
beer
it
was
my
expectations
were
normal
for
a
beer
enthusiast
that
is
it
was
poured
for
me
out
of
a
can
i
was
surprised
by
how
good
it
was
since
then
i
made
a
trip
to
brewers
art
in
baltimore
and
enjoyed
the
beer
again
on
tap
in
their
marvelous
cellar
atmosphere
it
felt
very
right
the
beer
is
exquisite
even
now
that
ozzy
has
been
rebranded
as
beazly
the
look
smell
taste
feel
and
might
i
mention
nostalgia
remain
the
same
it
is
a
great
belgian
style
pale
ale
and
always
a
refreshing
delight
to
enjoy
i
highly
recommend
do
not
be
turned
off
by
its
container
a
can
is
more
environmentally
sound
protects
it
better
from
uv
and
when
poured
into
a
glass
does
not
take
away
from
the
experience
overall
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
overall
45
beazlyozzy
is
a
very
good
easydrinking
belgianstyle
pale
ale
that
works
in
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
i
particularly
like
how
it
goes
from
fruity
to
slightly
bittergrassy
to
earthy
and
dry
in
the
finish
good
transition
of
flavors
i
do
wish
that
this
beer
was
slightly
more
carbonated
after
it
sits
in
the
glass
for
a
while
were
talking
45
mins
it
tastes
flat
and
still
this
can
easily
be
remedied
so
im
hoping
the
good
folks
at
brewers
art
do
so
o
excellent
beer
and
stands
up
to
the
classics
in
this
style
o
a
tasty
beer
overall
the
phenols
are
kept
in
check
even
though
the
yeast
is
the
star
in
this
beer
the
hop
character
comes
through
more
so
when
it
warms
up
and
it
gets
more
drinkable
overall
this
beer
isnt
a
winner
the
aroma
and
appearance
thought
this
would
be
an
out
of
the
park
home
run
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
left
me
disappointed
brewers
art
makes
much
better
stuff
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
brew
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
ive
had
before
definitely
a
kludge
of
styles
thumbs
up
od
good
stuff
nailed
the
style
in
the
ways
that
i
wanted
it
to
dangerously
drinkable
strong
belgian
pale
ales
dont
need
to
be
really
complex
or
over
the
top
just
have
the
requisite
components
that
have
made
this
style
world
famous
this
was
better
than
most
north
american
takes
on
the
style
prost
a
well
made
belgian
brew
that
is
packaged
in
a
cool
can
with
a
fist
taste
also
shows
alot
of
yeasty
phenols
banana
papaya
pepper
and
cloves
the
malt
is
light
maybe
some
biscuits
and
the
hops
have
a
nice
little
snap
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
a
little
less
lively
than
say
a
duvel
but
it
is
hearty
enough
with
a
nice
creaminess
easy
to
drink
belgian
style
brew
one
of
the
better
american
made
versions
and
in
a
can
revisited
my
review
when
having
the
beer
again
and
yes
right
on
for
a
beer
that
you
can
find
for
9
99
a
six
this
is
an
absolutely
awesome
beer
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
for
sharing
with
those
who
want
to
experience
a
belgian
overall
good
warm
weather
beer
for
people
who
like
wheat
beers
blue
moon
fans
meet
your
king
d
not
bad
not
great
finding
this
very
middle
of
the
road
wish
i
knew
what
this
crap
was
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
working
past
that
this
thing
still
doesnt
have
anything
that
really
grabs
me
o
i
like
this
one
a
lot
its
vibrant
and
tasty
while
remaining
fairly
approachable
perhaps
because
its
a
bit
less
phenolic
than
some
other
belgianstyle
pales
a
fruity
dry
and
drinkable
winner
i
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
like
duvel
since
the
description
said
it
was
their
answer
to
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
served
in
a
chimay
like
goblet
glass
touch
of
apple
on
the
nose
some
alcohol
and
malt
halfone
finger
head
for
me
it
didnt
feel
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
it
tasted
more
of
a
saison
with
a
boozy
bite
to
it
that
didnt
mean
the
beer
was
bad
but
it
was
not
described
properly
would
i
get
it
again
probably
not
o
im
always
skeptical
of
any
belgianstyle
ale
in
a
can
they
always
seem
syrupy
and
strange
this
however
really
does
a
deft
job
of
skating
around
the
fact
that
its
not
bottle
conditioned
by
successfully
pulling
off
a
sweeter
more
cidery
bend
even
better
it
keeps
the
epic
drinkability
i
look
for
from
the
style
its
not
quite
duvel
but
i
reckon
its
as
good
as
a
canned
bspa
can
get
12oz
can
clear
gold
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
patches
swathes
of
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
mix
of
sweetness
fruit
and
spice
this
is
quite
zippy
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
similar
bready
sugars
fruit
getting
a
good
bit
of
tart
apple
and
spicy
throughout
the
finish
is
especially
dry
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
sharp
and
lively
feel
to
the
carbonation
that
pops
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
little
alcohol
here
ive
always
thought
that
ozzy
was
a
decent
beer
but
im
happy
to
see
that
you
can
now
enjoy
it
in
a
12oz
portion
instead
of
having
to
commit
to
a
750ml
bottle
this
translated
to
the
canned
packaging
well
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
agree
with
another
ba
that
the
abv
seems
higher
than
the
label
indicates
a
flavorful
complex
devil
beer
that
is
a
delight
to
drink
seems
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
advertised
the
alcohol
strong
spice
and
good
amount
of
hops
makes
this
a
strong
ale
that
takes
the
palate
for
a
serious
tasty
ride
o
deliciously
simple
and
a
bargain
to
boot
a
case
purchase
is
imminent
for
sure
i
wonder
if
a
little
something
was
lost
without
the
bottle
conditioning
i
need
to
buy
a
bottle
some
time
to
find
out
the
crack
once
more
revealed
a
brimful
cantainer
and
i
cannot
hold
back
my
joy
at
this
seeming
trend
among
craft
canners
an
inverted
glug
later
and
we
were
on
a
roll
i
had
a
solid
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
boiled
and
bubbled
like
any
good
witchs
brew
and
slowly
fell
leaving
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
suddenly
king
midas
and
croesus
were
wrestling
with
me
not
over
the
beer
but
over
our
new
favorite
nebraska
native
val
midwest
nose
was
spicy
but
not
from
adjuncts
but
undoubtedly
from
the
yeast
which
also
imparted
a
pleasant
mustiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
a
canglomeration
between
juicyfruit
and
big
red
gum
it
was
mixed
fruity
but
also
hot
and
spicy
jeezo
man
i
may
need
a
laydown
after
this
one
the
lacing
that
had
begun
to
appear
was
going
to
require
a
jackhammer
to
remove
and
i
just
returned
my
rental
the
other
day
my
mind
is
starting
to
smooth
out
and
this
is
not
helping
in
fact
it
may
be
paving
the
way
finish
was
dry
thanks
to
the
yeast
having
done
its
job
in
a
big
way
im
done
overall
i
really
like
this
coming
from
the
can
great
flavors
and
bspa
qualities
just
missing
a
bit
more
malt
flavoring
in
taste
the
dry
yeasty
finish
is
quite
pleasant
and
not
overly
dry
even
some
honey
taste
it
seems
like
a
nice
balance
of
yeast
flavors
the
bitterness
fruit
and
dry
sensation
from
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
bought
at
whole
foods
in
washington
dc
overall
its
pretty
good
bspa
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
thats
a
minor
knock
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
fruity
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
the
same
but
milder
still
fruits
some
hops
and
malts
alcohol
is
well
hidden
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
and
good
quality
beer
poured
out
as
a
very
nice
clear
golden
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
with
a
thin
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
floral
fruity
and
very
bready
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
metallic
up
front
the
more
you
have
the
less
of
that
you
get
the
beer
has
a
nice
bready
sweetness
with
a
bananalike
fruit
flavor
the
hops
give
this
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
good
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
really
quite
good
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
it
turned
out
to
be
really
good
cheers
insanely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
fantastic
bspa
overall
i
am
buying
shitloads
of
this
one
my
new
favorite
also
it
is
now
available
in
cans
o
a
very
enjoyable
above
average
belgian
style
offering
glad
to
see
this
on
tap
as
a
full
bottle
would
be
a
little
much
for
me
golden
colored
pour
pristine
clarity
topped
with
a
small
rocky
white
head
low
retention
and
just
a
bit
of

quite
belgian
in
the
nose

spice
herbal

with

peppery

light

pretty
easily

but
nothing
amazing
not
really
sure
what
this
beer
has
to
do
with
ozzy
unless
its
a
prince
of
darkness
reference
or
something
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
smells
of
sweet
and
candy
sugar
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
light
caramel
pepper
and
spice
the
flavor
is
malty

with
sweet
sugars
up

that
are
sandwiched
between
tangerine
and
orange
peel
light
pepper
and
spice
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
funk
before
a
sweet
lingering
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
nice
belgian
ale
a
bit
sweet
and
fruity
but
so
easy
to
drink
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
poured
a
clearish
gold
with
good
head
that
stuck
around
forever
had
a
decent
aroma
of
yeastiness
touch
of
orange
and
citric
and
bitter
hops
tad
bit
of
fruit
and
some
sweet
sugary
malts
easy
to
drink
has
a
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
fruit
as
well
as
some
spiceiness
for
a
little
kick
a
bit
on
the
plush
juicy
side
with
a
filling
mouth
cant
really
pinpoint
the
fruits
other
than
something
like
applepear
and
a
touch
of
tropical
as
well
some
sweet
malt
as
well
but
ultimately
finishes
dry
with
a
crisp
kick
and
is
an
excellent
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
terribly
hot
summer
day
o
another
great
belgian
beer
by
brewers
art
i
liked
this
more
on
tap
than
the
bottle
notes
flavors
are
spot
on
but
the
mouthfeel
gets
a
little
cloying
after
a
few
sips
decent
but
not
duvel
doverall
this
was
a
good
bspa
but
it
wasnt
as
good
as
i
hoped
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
just
wasnt
balanced
enough
for
me
the
spices
and
hops
and
champagne
flavors
just
didnt
mesh
as
well
as
i
hoped
it
was
still
an
easy
drinker
but
not
the
mind
blowing
flavors
and
complexity
that
i
had
hoped
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
a
good
amount
of
white
frothy
head
very
pretty
smells
yeasty
and
lightly
flowery
hops
are
barely
detectable
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
little
citrusy
floral
flavors
coupled
with
some
nice
hoppiness
the
sweetness
masks
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
well
good
carbonation
solid
mouthfeel
overall
very
enjoyable
again
i
say
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
available
enough
complexity
that
i
would
want
to
buy
again
and
i
think
that
this
has
great
potential
for
interesting
food
pairings
i
have
had
the
entire
bottle
in
one
sitting
and
i
think
i
now
know
why
these
beers
are
considered
devilish
appearance
is
a
light
gold
color
with
a
bright
white
head
the
first
pour
with
the
pressure
from
the
cork
left
two
fingers
of
it
ozzy
has
a
nose
with
spices
belgian
yeast
malts
and
citrus
it
is
very
pleasant
and
balanced
the
taste
has
more
malts
caramel
some
hops
lemon
and
grass
mf
is
medium
and
nice
carbonation
level
from
this
bottle
from
the
u
s
produced
bspas
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
was
one
of
the
best
o
this
one
was
a
great
introduction
to
brewers
art
if
it
was
available
to
me
i
would
snatch
it
up
for
dinner
parties
as
a
wine
alternative
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
makes
its
accessible
in
somewhat
larger
quantities
this
is
one
of
the
first
belgian
golden
ales
i
have
really
enjoyed
nicely
done
notes
i
was
looking
forward
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
but
since
it
is
not
particularly
a
style
im
after
i
was
setting
it
aside
and
setting
it
aside
that
was
quite
a
mistake
this
is
very
quaffable
rich
and
pleasing
and
makes
for
a
great
quality
social
brew
regional
touch
to
it
and
if
for
people
getting
the
nod
to
black
sabbathosborne
it
even
adds
an
extra
nice
touch
to
it
d
if
didnt
already
know
this
one
was
from
baltimore
md
i
would
have
truly
mistaken
this
for
an
authentic
belgian
brewed
pale
ale
worthy
for
all
bas
to
seek
out
this
one
comes
highly
recommend
next
trip
to
md
ill
be
stocking
up
on
a
couple
of
these
bottles
this
one
goes
down
easy
gulp
after
gulp
this
beer
flat
out
kicks
ass
im
putting
it
on
my
wants
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
i
expected
with
lots
of
tight
carbonation
and
earthy
bitter
hops
up
front
that
linger
throughout
into
a
dry
finish
well
balanced
with
a
good
bit
of
earthy
tart
flavor
countered
by
zesty
spice
light
fruit
sweet
alcohol
and
dry
champagne
yeast
effervescence
hints
of
pepper
and
clove
as
well
as
some
apple
pear
grass
straw
and
alcohol
similar
to
duvel
but
not
quite
as
good
with
a
fuller
body
stronger
hop
presence
and
less
alcohol
bite
it
has
more
of
a
spicy
and
herbal
presence
than
i
prefer
and
all
of
the
flavors
are
a
bit
much
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
all
these
factors
make
for
very
high
drinkability
excellent
beer
glad
i
bought
it
will
buyhave
again
the
bspa
was
a
joy
to
savor
i
found
this
to
be
the
most
intriguing
ales
of
the
night
at
brewers
art
the
hop
flavor
works
so
well
with
the
yeast
with
the
dry
finsish
and
moderately
strong
alcohol
a
very
quenching
beer
w
lots
of
hops
much
like
a
belgian
ipa
this
is
a
class
act
uh
is
there
any
way
to
sublet
our
souls
to
be
able
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
sure
it
ranks
very
well
within
the
devil
beer
realm
but
it
comes
across
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
devil
beer
hybrid
which
makes
us
salivate
that
much
more
dangerously
drinkable
another
glass
please
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
f
finishes
very
dry
again
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
more
hops
and
some
of
the
spices
some
lingering
belgian
golden
malts
and
light
fruit
a
light
lingering
off
bitterness
though
that
isnt
as
pleasant
as
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
it
drinks
very
well
too
especially
for
7
25
abv
and
pretty
dry
i
loved
the
place
and
look
forward
to
trying
other
offerings
notes
from

golden
liquid
bread
nice
golden
glow
in
the
glass
smells
like
fresh
bread
with
something
spicey
on
top
good
lacing
with
perfect
carbonation
improved
as
it
warmed
to
room
temp
just
a
little
sense
of
the
alchohol
not
objectionable
tho
will
be
buying
this
again
most
definatly
overall
just
solid
as
could
be
love
the
style
and
it
was
super
drinkable
nothing
at
all
to
complain
about
here
d
a
pretty
good
belgian
i
enjoyed
the
citrus
fruit
in
the
taste
and
thought
the
spices
and
yeast
made
for
a
typical
belgian
style
beer
would
try
again
pours
a
pale
golden
color
nice
and
clear
lots
of
bubbles
bubbles
rising
up
through
the
beer
from
the
pour
to
the
last
sip
nice
looking
the
final
pour
yields
a
little
haze
i
split
this
one
into
a
couple
pours
a
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
is
great
powdery
milled
grains
a
little
spice
and
grassiness
lemongrass
and
herbs
are
strong
very
leafy
but
also
the
pale
grains
are
nice
crackery
a
little
bready
the
taste
is
good
a
very
nice
malty
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
first
along
with
a
pleasant
fruity
flavor
and
some
peppery
yeast
then
you
start
to
get
this
spicy
herbal
leafiness
as
it
warms
the
herbal
flavors
start
to
come
alive
more
and
mix
in
well
with
the
dry
crackery
flavors
the
yeast
character
is
also
very
nice
provides
excellent
dryness
almost
a
little
chalkypowdery
with
a
nice
spice
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
thin
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
it
bites
as
you
swallow
a
bit
the
alcohol
sort
of
slowly
gets
to
you
im
glad
i
shared
a
bit
with
my
roomate
but
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
a
very
nice
take
on
a
belgian
style
beer
brewed
stateside
and
a
nice
beer
that
i
wouldve
never
tried
otherwise
thanks
paul
thanks
chad
for
the
trade
was
a
great
way
to
kick
off
the
trip
to
wbf
raleigh
2010
the
beer
looks
really
good
clear
golden
pilsner
appearance
but
with
a
large
rocky
drylooking
foam
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
duvel
otherwise
it
tends
to
mimic
the
profile
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
its
hard
to
notice
the
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
with
this
beer
that
grows
its
cereal
and
not
pleasant
unfortunately
there
is
some
sweetness
and
good
yeast
character
coming
through
some
estery
components
it
finishes
a
little
dry
overall
its
ok
its
not
duvel
d
an
okay
version
of
the
style
overall
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
can
give
its
belgian
brethren
a
run
for
their
money
recommended
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
very
nice
blonde
the
went
great
with
burritos
and
stood
strongly
on
it
own
as
well
really
nice
and
wonderfully
drinkable
ive
really
enjoyed
all
the
beers
ive
had
rom
brewers
art
d
dangerously
drinkable
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
while
alcohol
character
is
fairly
muted
its
effects
are
not
felt
until
standing
up
good
beer
good
drinking
overall
a
pretty
solid
shot
at
the
style
on
the
part
of
the
brewers
art
and
im
happy
i
got
to
try
an
offering
from
a
brewery
ive
never
tried
before
that
being
said
it
was
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
there
are
other
examples
id
turn
to
first
when
seeking
out
a
belgian
pale
ale
a
750ml
corked
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
poured
into
matching
shaker
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
around
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
foam
aroma
and
flavor
consist
of
spicy
yeast
fresh
black
pepper
lemon
zest
caramelized
pears
and
apples
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
alcohol
to
speak
of
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
this
was
a
great
warm
weather
ale
my
glass
was
empty
rather
quickly
shared
by
gford217
at
one
of
our
brick
store
pub
gatherings
thanks
for
the
opportunity
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
pours
a
relatively
light
golden
with
lots
of
suspended
particles
okay
head
smells
very
grainy
with
some
late
creaminess
tastes
a
bit
like
a
saison
certainly
far
more
than
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
but
with
a
lot
of
graininess
thrown
into
the
mix
that
distracts
somewhat
from
other
flavors
and
muddies
the
taste
a
bit
not
as
sweet
as
a
tripel
but
sweeter
than
most
belgian
pales
there
are
some
grassy
hops
here
as
well
as
a
touch
of
lemon
citrus
but
the
grain
kinda
dominates
everything
else
medium
bodied
and
fairly
pleasant
but
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
picked
up
for
me
by
dyan
thanks
man
and
i
look
forward
to
meeting
you
saturday
afternoon
the
original
price
on
this
was
nine
dollars
split
with
my
dad
tonight
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
tonight
light
golden
yellow
color
with
some
small
orange
highlights
two
inch
white
bubbly
and
soapy
head
some
retention
lacing
at
first
aroma
is
made
up
of
hoppiness
belgian
yeast
mild
citrus
pepper
coriander
orange
peel
and
berries
flavor
starts
off
sweet
with
yeasty
accents
citrus
in
the
middle
some
nice
hoppiness
in
the
finish
to
give
the
belgian
yeast
a
nice
balancing
point
spices
come
out
later
on
as
it
warms
and
pretty
peppery
too
gets
sweeter
by
the
end
but
the
hops
are
still
there
to
mediate
sweet
spicy
and
dry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
well
could
have
drank
this
bottle
myself
not
too
strong
and
does
not
taste
like
it
either
pretty
smooth
actually
smoother
as
it
warms
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
this
style
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
was
pretty
good
one
of
the
closest
things
i
have
had
to
duvel
would
drink
again
recommended
overall
this
is
a
solid
bspa
nothing
overly
exciting
but
well
done
worth
a
shot
d
way
too
drinkable
this
is
only
my
second
beer
from
brewers
art
and
like
the
first
its
a
wellconstructed
brew
that
shows
extremely
good
drinkability
good
stuff
both
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
good
has
a
dry
woody
finish
with
a
healthy
aftertaste
fairly
smooth
with
average
drinkability
a
good
brew
but
from
what
my
friend
tells
me
id
probably
like
the
other
brewers
art
beverages
more
d
very
good
beer
thats
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
if
your
not
careful
definitely
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
once
the
carbonation
settles
a
little
it
is
even
nicer
solid
belgian
pale
pours
a
very

lots
of
fruit
to
back
it
up
apple

a

in

some

pretty

with
high

a
little
rough
going
down
because
of
the
carbonation
but
still
quite
nice
i
dig
this

from
such
a

reasonable
and

a
little
over
carbonated
for
me
it
was
also
way
too
sweet
and
had
a
strong
coriander
flavor
that
made
drinking
more
than
one
too
much
for
me
o
overall
the
yeasty
character
definitly
defines
this
beer
an
aspect
so
many
american
brewers
are
afraid
to
charter
into
not
at
all
timid
musky
damp
fruit
with
a
dry
tart
lemon
touch
really
pulls
all
the
punches
here
the
belgian
malt
is
biscuity
doughy
and
crisp
its
a
beer
that
slowly
reveals
itself
to
you
overtime
gaining
appreciation
and
complexity
with
each
savory
sip
the
yeastiness
really
feels
like
an
authentic
belgain
style
and
it
comes
in
a
can
d
a
great
ale
i
love
the
melding
of
big
hops
and
belgian
flavors
this
is
the
best
offering
that
the
brewers
art
produces
d
says
its
just
over
7
i
say
once
you
let
it
settle
down
it
drinks
quite
nicely
this
is
one
of
the
better
duvel
styled
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
im
glad
i
was
given
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
bottles
in
the
near
future

overcarbonation
is
distracting
making
this
the
clear
weakpoint
of
the
beer
if
you
want
to
enjoy
the
beer
the
best
i
would
suggest
letting
it
settle
considerably
in
the
glass
which
might
also
warm
it
slightly
which
mutes
the
sourness
and
brings
forward
the
pilsnerlike
malt
character
d
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
they
did
a
good
job
with
it
d
at
7
2abv
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
damn
what
is
up
with
brewers
art
all
three
beers
i
have
had
from
these
guys
have
been
outstanding
why
am
i
not
hearing
more
buzz
about
these
guys
they
certainly
deserve
it
this
is
a
fantastic
take
on
a
duvel
inspired
beer
fruity
and
spicier
than
duvel
the
added
character
definitely
works
wonderfully
especially
considering
that
this
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
duvel
that
added
flavors
definitely
help
to
tame
the
sweetness
quite
well
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
had
this
on
the
can
and
its
much
better
just
as
i
was
told
it
would
be
at
the
foodery
not
so
earthy
this
time
but
still
very
thick
on
the
profile
id
get
this
in
cans
if
it
was
readily
available
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
and
the
high
abv
might
make
this
a
oneanight
kind
of
beer
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
brewers
art
beers
that
having
been
said
i
still
think
id
drink
it
agian
just
an
excellent
beer
from
the
folks
at
brewers
art
d
very
drinkable
for
such
an
alcoholic
beer
very
refreshing
cheers
drinkability
is
good
would
definitely
have
another
drinkability
nicely
balanced
belgian
pale
love
the
finish
in
the
top
echelon
of
us
brewed
belgian
style
beers
d
considering
that
this
tastes
more
like
a
mild
picante
salsa
than
a
beer
this
is
pretty
good
it
is
definitely
unique
i
would
imagine
there
are
a
lot
of
foods
with
which
this
would
go
well
tortilla
chips
stands
out
in
my
mind
sessioning
would
be
difficult
but
not
unimaginable
this
is
one
worth
seeking
out
this
one
is
definitely
duvelish
not
as
complex
and
certainly
more
mild
mouthfeel
seemed
to
me
like
it
could
have
benefited
from
a
little
more
carbonation
moderate
body
from
the
sweetness
drinkability
is
good
but
it
seems
a
little
rich
to
be
a
true
sessioner
tried
this
beer
before
oriolesred
sox
game
at
a
local
baltimore
bar
appearance
is
of
most
other
belgian
strong
pales
golden
with
a
little
haziness
and
a
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
some
peppery
spices
the
taste
is
of
citrus
fruit
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
aftertaste
lingering
not
too
powerful
or
complex
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
but
a
good
local
brew
for
sure
on
tap
at
ujs
on
the
manatawny
nice
to
see
a
brewers
art
beer
in
the
philadelphia
area
as
they
dont
come
around
that
often
the
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
medium
thickness
white
head
that
lasted
for
a
bit
the
aroma
of
the
ozzy
was
a
nice
malty
sweet
smelling
bouquet
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
nice
malty
bready
taste
with
some
sweetness
and
a
good
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
with
a
medium
body
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
drinkable
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
wisp
of
white
head
the
nose
of
grainy
malts
and
peppary
spiciness
come
through
rather
good
in
the
flavor
as
well
sweet
citrusy
and
dry
finishing
this
is
just
an
all
around
good
pounder
finished
one
or
four
while
watching
the
yankees
recently
lose
in
the
postseason
the
best
of
both
worlds
substantial
goes
down
good
tasty
finish
a
beerdrinkers
beer
had
this
on
tap
in
the
brewers
art
pours
a
liight
gold
with
a
thin
finger
of
head
and
pretty
good
retention
nose
is
a
grainy
malt
with
a
slight
bit
of
pepper
taste
is
a
pretty
rich
malty
bread
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
and
a
citrussy
hop
finish
which
is
strong
for
the
style
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
a
really
dry
finish
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
alcohol
content
and
goes
great
with
the
garlic
fries
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
head
this
gives
off
the
expected
sweet
lemon
and
spicepepper
aromas
with
some
hints
of
cracked
dried
coriander
and
light
malt
similar
flavors
with
a
bit
of
a
rindlike
bitter
twist
on
the
end
which
threw
me
for
a
bit
of
a
loop
not
nearly
enough
body
this
really
did
taste
and
feel
just
a
bit
watered
down
perhaps
its
a
bit
too
filtered
i
didnt
notice
any
haze
at
all
drinkability
is
very
good
smooth
and
lush
on
the
palate
with
nice
transitions
between
grain
pale
malts
and
the
citrusy
hops
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
at
brewers
art
unlike
many
belgians
i
find
this
one
if
very
well
balanced
and
definitely
has
some
noticeable
hop
character
of
course
the
malts
take
precedence
but
do
not
to
over
the
top
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
care
must
be
taken
since
it
is
a
bit
stronger
than
the
usual
beer
unbelievable
to
be
able
to
get
a
belgian
of
this
quality
at
a
2
happy
hour
price
drinkability
very
other
no
spices
are
used
in
the
making
of
this
at
all
its
all
from
the
yeast
from
the
tap
at
the
grey
lodge
this
beer
poured
a
clean
and
clear
gold
color
a
thinning
white
head
topped
off
this
brew
low
carbonation
from
this
beer
emits
a
strange
egg
like
aroma
or
it
can
maybe
be
described
as
a
sanford
felt
tip
marker
the
taste
is
light
fruity
and
has
a
spicy
almost
peppery
hop
bite
lemon
cough
drop
notes
come
out
medium
malt
bodied
beer
and
finishes
sharp
and
clean
with
a
light
and
peppery
dryness
and
a
dry
spicy
hop
sting
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
has
a
distinctiveness
about
it
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
straight
4s
down
the
line
on
this
solid
brewpours
a
lighter
shade
of
gold
with
a
nice
big
fluffy
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
very
citriusy
seemed
to
be
a
very
malt
accented
brew
tastes
of
citruis
and
some
light
smokiness
with
a
big
malty
finish
i
have
had
3
or
4
of
the
brewers
art
beers
and
all
seem
to
be
pretty
solid
the
beer
was
gold
in
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
aroma
was
nice
with
some
floral
citrus
and
other
sweet
notes
the
taste
was
as
expected
malty
and
yeasty
with
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
mellow
version
of
duvel
a
clear
yellowgold
body
displays
streams
of
very
tiny
bubbles
rising
steadily
beneath
a
brightwhite
head
of
creamy
foam
the
retention
is
decent
and
although
it
eventually
drops
to
a
thin
but
creamy
collar
it
does
leave
some
very
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
offers
a
distinct
applepear
fruit
note
amidst
sweetish
malt
slightly
citrusy
floral
hops
and
a
gentle
spiciness
coriander
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
in
the
flavor
all
of
the
elements
found
in
the
nose
are
carried
over
it
starts
crisp
and
fruity
some
light
cherry
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
lowkey
fruitlike
tartness
develops
some
malty
sweetness
and
delicate
spicy
character
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishes
with
a
firm
bitterness
a
drying
wash
of
alcohol
some
lowkey
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
residual
fruity
malt
very
wellbalanced
with
a
restrained
spiciness
flavorful
smooth
yet
crisp
and
deceptively
drinkable
impressive
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
an
amber
color
that
had
yellowred
hues
to
it
when
held
up
to
the
light
that
was
fairly
clear
it
produced
a
creamy
white
head
that
lasted
fairly
well
to
mid
glass
then
formed
a
small
film
and
ring
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
fruits
sweet
malt
caramel
spices
and
floral
hops
nice
balance
to
the
aroma
each
aroma
seemed
to
be
well
pronounced
the
tastes
were
full
of
flavor
good
fruits
apples
oranges
pears
some
spices
clove
rich
malts
floral
hops
citrus
alcohol
and
some
yeast
the
aftertaste
was
rich
in
malt
and
fruit
it
was
medium
bodied
and
big
flavored
all
flavors
seemed
to
be
very
well
pronounced
and
blended
very
well
a
smooth
drink
and
somewhat
sneaky
because
the
flavors
disguise
the
alcohol
very
well
a
really
good
beer
from
this
brewery
