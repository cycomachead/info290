looks
like
a
stout
smells
like
a
minnow
bucket
tastes
like
minnow
bucket
water
ok
the
last
part
is
a
stretch
but
truthfully
this
is
a
pretty
weak
offering
as
a
milk
stout
very
little
sweetness
cream
cocoa
or
coffee
very
thin
feel
and
no
alcohol
to
boot
another
disappointment
from
lazy
magnolia
i
tol
ya
bout
lazy
magnolia
not
really
that
good
kinda
sweet
and
relatively
bland
meh
ps
being
forced
to
write
a
review
weak
sauce
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
light
a
fingernail
of
khaki
head
covers
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
about
13
of
the
top
aroma
is
faint
but
i
get
starchy
sweet
potato
and
lactose
the
flavor
is
lactose
and
the
sweet
potato
almost
gives
it
a
smoky
note
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
silky
a
roasted
milky
stout
gladly
not
overly
sweet
and
with
predominant
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
lazy
magnolias
description
included
this
the
sweet
potatoes
provide
the
background
to
an
impressive
taste
with
added
notes
of
roasted
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
i
detected
no
chocolate
or
coffee
in
this
it
tastes
like
an
amber
lager
o
i
just
wish
it
had
a
fuller
body
this
was
surprisingly
smooth
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
lighter
body
than
some
of
the
other
milk
stouts
on
the
market
as
it
sits
the
taste
changes
from
heavier
chocolate
tone
to
a
lighter
one
and
the
sweet
potato
undertone
makes
its
appearance
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
overall
this
beer
is
an
enjoyable
stout
with
some
areas
for
improvement
in
the
appearance
and
aromas
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
tasting
and
decently
original
take
on
a
stout
though
the
beer
has
a
few
inconsistent
hiccups
along
the
way
its
overall
character
is
charming
raw
and
creative
isnt
that
what
you
want
out
of
a
southern
gem
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
and
pours
very
smoothly
with
only
a
halo
of
light
tan
head
on
the
surface
looks
heavy
aromas
of
cream
chocolate
coffee
and
earthy
notes
all
leaning
towards
the
rich
and
sweet
side
flavors
are
bittersweet
forward
with
hints
of
smoke
all
on
a
richly
sweet
backbone
notes
of
sweet
potato
bakers
chocolate
cream
and
coffee
all
blend
together
to
provide
a
balanced
palate
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
sharp
undertone
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
more
on
the
bitter
and
roasted
side
with
a
bittersweet
linger
into
the
smooth
clean
finish
interesting
brew
and
an
easy
drinker
tasty
and
very
unique
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
stout
that
goes
down
easy
the
flavors
are
nice
and
rich
without
being
overbearing
thanksgiving
day
beer
tasting
at
bros
house
overall
this
is
by
no
means
great
but
id
certainly
drink
it
again
i
am
beginning
to
like
lazy
magnolia
more
and
more
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
for
a
sessionable
milk
stout
overall
a
solid
attempt
and
different
than
any
other
milk
stout
ive
had
successful
when
it
comes
to
infusing
that
sweet
potato
characteristic
without
overpowering
but
the
feel
of
this
one
impacts
negatively
in
a
way
that
influences
the
smell
and
taste
overall
this
beer
is
just
ok
the
vegetable
added
to
a
stout
may
just
not
be
my
style
recommended
for
outdoor
barbecues
or
get
togethers
overall
this
was
an
ok
brew
not
my
favorite
overall
the
beer
is
worth
trying
simply
due
to
the
novelty
of
a
sweet
potato
stout
the
beer
smells
fantastic
but
the
tasteflavor
was
lacking
the
brown
head
of
the
beer
makes
it
look
like
its
going
to
pack
some
flavor
think
old
rasputin
but
it
simply
doesnt
rjt
this
is
easily
the
blackest
pour
ive
seen
with
regards
to
the
low
abv
jeff
stout
pours
out
pitch
black
with
two
fingers
of
dense
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
roasty
and
ever
so
slightly
earthy
the
taste
is
pretty
standard
sadly
there
are
not
yams
everywhere
they
might
attribute
a
slight
bit
of
earthiness
that
could
also
be
attributed
to
hops
theres
a
bit
of
stale
coffee
in
the
middle
to
go
with
some
sweet
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
jeff
stout
is
a
pretty
decent
sweet
stout
not
my
favorite
but
tasty
enough
should
appeal
to
guinness
drinkers
a
little
more
complex
than
city
slickers
would
ever
want
to
admit
comes
out
of
the
south
a
little
chocolate
coffee
lactose
sweet
potato
even
the
potato
i
suspect
has
an
oatmeal
like
lending
of
smoothness
to
the
beer
gotta
like
the
low
abv
that
makes
this
an
even
moreso
effortless
beer
to
drink
maybe
mid
bodied
just
a
tad
thin
the
flavors
just
dont
linger
too
long
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
bunch
of
this
easily
the
quintessential
session
sweet
stout
would
have
it
probably
only
for
this
purpose
however
good
atmosphere
dark
hue
nice
albeit
fleeting
head
but
no
lacing
nose
and
flavor
are
characteristic
of
the
style
roasted
coffee
bean
and
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
sweet
pungent
tone
from
the
sweet
potatoes
and
a
thick
syrupy
character
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
shot
for
sure
overall
this
is
good
but
not
my
favorite
from
lm
served
from
growler
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
lactose
roasted
malt
earth
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
this
one
had
a
pretty
good
nose
going
on
with
it
with
a
nice
touch
of
lactose
that
you
would
expect
and
a
nice
roastiness
as
well
the
flavor
however
was
much
more
roasty
than
i
prefer
for
my
milk
stouts
the
sweet
malt
and
cream
aspect
couldnt
shake
a
stick
at
all
the
earth
dark
chocolate
and
roastiness
worth
trying
to
say
that
you
have
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
high
on
my
list
of
the
style
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
wildly
uneven
drinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
great
to
finally
see
this
in
the
upstate
ive
had
it
on
tap
a
time
or
two
and
have
been
looking
forward
to
the
bottled
version
im
glad
lazy
magnolia
was
able
to
finally
make
this
available
in
an
accessible
format
and
anticipate
packs
on
their
own
the
beer
appears
opaque
black
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
i
also
did
not
pick
up
the
sweet
potatoes
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
but
they
did
contribute
to
the
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
on
the
milder
side
of
sweet
with
some
nice
malt
backbone
i
detected
the
chocolate
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
for
this
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
beer
this
was
enjoyable
to
drink
and
its
a
solid
beer
from
the
guys
at
lazy
magnolia
appears
an
opaque
black
with
light
tan
colored
head
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
a
sweet
sugary
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
roastiness
very
similar
flavors
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
bitter
cocoa
balanced
though
not
overly
sweet
or
dry
medium
thickness
creamy
body
pours
a
beautiful
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
has
notes
of
roast
coffee
and
molasses
as
well
as
burnt
malt
flavor
has
coffee
licorice
and
chocolate
tones
with
a
hint
of
smoky
wood
fullbodied
texture
has
some
good
fizz
didnt
get
any
sweet
potato
or
milk
notes
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
stout
mouthfeel
is
leans
just
a
little
towards
the
heavier
side
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
big
malty
sweetness
the
sweetness
doesnt
really
seem
out
of
place
for
the
style
either
i
liked
the
candied
sweet
potato
aspect
of
it
at
under
5
abv
i
wasnt
expecting
a
big
bold
stout
and
i
didnt
get
one
i
did
think
though
that
it
was
a
pretty
good
drinking
nicely
flavored
interesting
beer
for
the
low
abv
o
another
with
pecan
beer
mildly
disappointing
offering
from
this
brewer
but
better
than
the
pecan
ale
and
certainly
a
decent
brew
o
a
really
interesting
and
drinkable
stout
big
rich
sweet
flavors
but
the
roasted
coffee
notes
help
cut
the
sweetness
from
being
cloying
there
were
some
big
metallic
notes
at
first
but
they
went
away
as
it
warmed
up
served
in
a
tulip
nonic
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
creamy
two
inch
tancolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
18th
inch
skim
thick
textured
bands
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
session
nose
reveals
espresso
roast
lactose
and
peanut
butter
there
is
also
a
suggestion
of
cocoa
and
something
metallic
taste
expresses
char
and
cocoa
the
metallic
quality
in
the
nose
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
light
acidity
i
dont
see
a
lot
of
milk
stouts
being
produced
so
im
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
them
when
they
present
that
said
i
found
this
one
decent
but
somewhat
lacking
in
the
traditional
lactose
sweetness
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
that
as
well
as
the
metallic
notes
detract
from
this
beer
overall
good
smooth
stout
with
lots
of
flavor
but
avoids
a
complicated
palate
highly
accessible
3
5
the
comments
from
others
are
spot
on
for
me
clean
simple
and
perhaps
lacking
in
presence
sometimes
when
i
grab
a
stout
i
do
want
a
deeper
flavor
profile
on
the
other
hand
there
are
times
that
this
one
would
be
just
right
the
abv
is
good
enough
to
get
that
relaxed
feeling
plus
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
taste
of
alcohol
the
texture
sets
a
good
background
for
eating
cuisine
that
already
has
bold
flavors
such
as
that
local
nola
eatery
and
my
memory
is
that
there
is
a
nice
finish
to
this
beer
a
safe
and
secure
beer
that
has
its
place
having
said
that
i
do
wish
that
they
would
experiment
to
let
one
note
stand
out
while
still
maintaining
a
good
balance
nothing
provocative
but
something
slightly
more
distinguished
would
be
in
order
if
this
is
a
beer
in
progress
i
sure
hope
that
it
makes
its
way
to
kentucky
in
bottles
or
tap
i
would
definitely
keep
it
in
stock
a
very
gentle
stout
even
for
a
milk
stout
pours
pitch
black
with
a
slight
head
smells
very
lightly
roasty
a
touch
watery
and
milky
very
soft
in
the
mouth
with
flavors
that
are
very
soft
lightly
milky
and
roasty
in
parts
and
with
a
slightly
metalic
finish
not
bad
but
a
bit
simple
and
light
overall
a
pedestrian
brew
lacking
presence
it
left
my
hankering
for
something
better
so
i
opted
for
a
bells
kalamazoo
for
the
next
round
overall
a
very
smooth
stout
wish
it
came
in
bottles
i
see
why
this
is
one
of
lms
most
popular
offerings
back
to
the
beer
midnight
black
with
a
layer
of
lingering
cream
head
no
lacing
and
mild
legs
aroma
was
hard
to
catch
in
that
restaurant
light
chocolates
toffee
brown
sugar
sweet
potato
everything
is
toned
way
down
as
the
tongue
follows
the
nose
with
a
moderately
heavy
body
to
it
nice
sipper
earthy
sweet
potato
notes
take
some
adjusting
and
feel
out
of
place
overall
a
nice
sipper
a
quick
bite
up
front
from
something
like
dark
chocolate
it
smooths
out
quickly
with
some
caramel
but
mostly
molasses
maybe
some
toffee
lactose
spreads
out
the
flavors
and
adds
more
silkiness
but
still
has
some
pull
coffee
on
the
end
lingering
sweetness
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
lazy
magnolia
i
would
likely
try
it
again
to
pick
up
on
more
of
its
subtleties
very
simple
but
all
around
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
highly
recommended
overall
a
different
type
of
stout
this
growler
will
not
last
long
overall
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
lm
beers
it
is
perfect
on
a
hot
southern
afternoon
this
has
a
nice
combo
of
the
biting
coffee
and
super
sweet
sugar
i
could
have
several
of
these
a
unique
beer
that
may
be
my
new
favorite
in
the
style
notes
a
decent
beer
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
alot
little
complexity
and
light
on
taste
and
body
but
not
bad
i
am
still
proud
of
our
ms
brewery
dnot
drinkable
whatsoever
only
my
respect
for
beer
kept
me
from
spilling
this
down
the
drain
i
dont
know
if
its
because
im
used
to
drinking
big
beers
the
southern
style
they
have
or
if
its
the
terrible
beer
laws
they
are
forced
to
abide
by
here
but
most
every
beer
has
been
fairly
lackluster
and
disappointing
great
drinking
beer
served
with
a
thick
creamy
fine
tan
head
and
some
lace
color
was
an
opaque
brown
black
aroma
was
chocolate
a
bit
of
coffee
roasted
malts
flavor
was
like
aroma
plus
nut
meats
and
a
great
bitter
to
sweet
balance
body
and
carbonation
were
appropriate
to
style
and
good
finish
was
like
flavor
and
medium
in
length
session
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
light
effervescence
overall
a
middleoftheroad
kind
of
brew
given
the
other
reviews
i
hope
that
this
one
might
just
have
been
off
a
bit
i
will
look
for
others
from
this
brewer
in
hopes
they
are
better
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
excellant
for
a
stout
the
low
abv
coupled
with
the
sweetish
coffee
taste
is
a
great
combination
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
lazy
magnolia
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
stouts
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
by
lazy
magnolia
this
needs
to
be
bottled
and
sold
along
with
their
other
flagship
offerings
a
good
concept
and
great
execution
by
lazy
mag
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
light
and
refreshing
this
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
has
always
left
me
wanting
more
my
favorite
offering
from
lm
so
far
and
one
that
ive
been
coming
back
to
a
lot
lately
d
the
drinkability
of
this
stout
is
up
for
debate
the
body
i
am
not
particular
fond
of
in
my
stouts
but
the
abv
level
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
something
that
i
could
have
a
couple
of
before
filling
up
d
low
abv
with
a
good
flavor
and
aroma
makes
an
easy
drinking
beer
insanely
easy
to
put
down
and
a
joy
to
drink
you
can
actually
trick
yourself
into
believing
there
is
no
way
that
this
a
small
beer
because
it
does
have
such
nice
and
big
flavors
and
aromas
if
you
ask
me
this
should
be
bottled
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
seller
for
lazy
mag
and
it
is
very
accessible
for
noobs
imo
i
wont
belittle
it
by
calling
it
a
gateway
stout
its
just
a
great
beer
this
beer
is
an
example
that
you
dont
need
a
stupid
high
abv
to
have
a
great
beer
with
good
flavor
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
its
relative
light
body
make
it
very
drinkable
and
one
could
have
a
ton
of
these
in
a
drinking
session
drinkability
is
very
high
i
would
guess
the
abv
around
5
56
0
abv
there
is
a
bit
more
kick
in
this
beer
than
most
from
lazy
mag
its
tasty
and
ill
definately
come
back
for
more
for
a
abv
of
3
5
it
has
quite
a
kick
to
it
compared
to
other
stouts
it
has
alot
less
prominent
after
taste
it
has
full
roasty
aromas
of
coffee
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
chocolate
and
the
signature
sweet
potato
i
would
definitely
recommend
drinkers
to
visit
kiln
mississippi
and
try
all
of
their
beers
i
hear
they
have
a
habanero
beer
i
love
lazy
mag
on
tap
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
faint
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
toffee
and
chocolate
with
an
overall
sweet
character
taste
is
quite
sweet
as
well
again
with
chocolate
coffee
and
cream
quite
earthy
in
the
background
very
nice
thick
feel
lots
of
character
and
body
for
such
a
light
abv
very
good
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
and
one
of
the
better
sessionable
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
pick
this
up
and
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
my
home
state
of
mississippi
d
this
stout
has
a
pretty
low
abv
and
is
nice
a
flavorful
that
equates
to
many
many
jefferson
stouts
in
a
session
excellent
brew
from
an
excellent
brewer
the
party
pig
is
woorth
the
money
to
have
js
available
when
the
urge
arises
many
thanks
to
the
j
clyde
for
having
this
on
cask
last
night
i
had
three
and
all
were
great
this
is
a
great
light
feeling
stout
poured
an
opaque
brownblack
head
seemed
to
dissipate
after
the
shock
of
hitting
the
glass
being
brewed
with
sweet
potatoes
added
a
different
feel
coffe
and
chocolate
lay
down
but
are
present
this
is
a
very
smoothe
drinking
stout
its
a
crying
shame
this
is
a
seasonal
as
it
would
be
a
great
summertime
sipping
stout
as
one
of
me
fellow
free
the
hops
member
stated
great
beer
it
arrived
with
just
a
few
wisps
of
head
that
swirled
and
went
away
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
the
color
was
an
extremely
dark
brown
sort
of
a
cola
color
but
with
ruby
highlights
it
did
not
allow
a
lot
of
light
to
penetrate
but
there
appeared
to
be
good
clarity
the
finish
had
a
lingering
sweetness
this
was
definitely
a
sweet
stout
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
intrigued
by
this
one
mississippis
brewery
indeed
ive
had
all
but
one
of
the
lazy
magnolia
brews
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
poured
a
beautiful
black
color
with
white
creamy
head
that
hung
around
until
the
end
made
with
sweet
potatoes
and
a
bit
of
milk
lactose
i
cant
say
that
i
taste
either
one
but
this
is
one
smooth
stout
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
but
excellent
try
it
this
beer
pours
very
dark
almost
black
which
scares
away
anyone
who
doesnt
like
dark
beer
but
they
are
truly
missing
out
because
this
is
a
very
smooth
stout
it
smells
of
coffee
and
definitely
has
a
nice
coffe
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
this
is
an
excellent
after
dinner
drink
many
restaurantsbars
will
serve
it
too
cold
let
it
sit
so
the
many
flavors
have
a
chance
to
come
out
it
is
a
seasonal
so
be
sure
to
try
it
if
you
see
it
this
is
a
solid
stout
overall
simple
and
flavourful
and
certainly
easy
drinking
a
nice
introduction
to
the
lazy
magnolia
family
for
sure
that
makes
me
eager
to
eventually
sample
some
more
of
their
brews
notes
lazy
magnolia
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
down
in
the
south
always
making
excellent
beers
and
excelling
at
what
they
do
this
brewery
is
going
places
the
wife
who
is
normally
only
marginally
stout
prone
went
absolutely
nuts
for
this
one
she
drank
half
of
mine
and
ordered
two
more
for
herself
afterwards
i
think
this
is
a
testament
to
its
smoothness
and
balance
it
will
definately
be
a
plus
when
and
if
the
brewery
starts
to
offer
their
brews
in
the
bottle
this
poured
dark
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
it
smelled
light
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
the
sweet
potatoes
used
in
this
beer
are
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
and
quite
interesting
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
i
would
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
chocolate
it
certainly
is
good
tasting
beer
for
when
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
not
to
sweet
though
some
might
compare
it
to
chocolate
milk
i
am
not
to
sure
about
that
but
it
does
make
a
good
beer
for
a
mixer
i
dont
really
need
chocolate
in
my
beer
but
i
have
to
admit
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
excellent
beer
very
well
balanced
great
taste
cant
complain
about
anything
always
have
this
in
the
fridge
explosive
upon
opening
best
to
open
standing
straight
up
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
has
a
bubbly
head
but
not
what
i
expected
for
a
stout
still
its
just
a
visual
issue
sometimes
hard
to
pair
with
food
better
as
a
dessert
beer
was
excited
to
try
this
one
due
to
previous
reviews
however
was
quite
a
bit
sweeter
then
i
was
expecting
and
didnt
have
the
body
that
i
usually
look
for
in
a
stout
overall
my
favorite
craft
beer
this
is
something
i
would
show
up
to
a
friends
house
with
on
game
night
so
that
they
drink
one
and
quit
so
that
i
can
save
the
rest
for
myself
if
youre
not
crazy
about
chocolate
you
might
want
to
skip
this
one
if
you
are
crazy
about
chocolate
however
and
happen
to
also
love
beer
this
is
an
awesome
brew
just
drink
it
slowly
got
this
in
a
sampler
pack
with
the
india
ale
and
oatmeal
stout
wouldnt
have
bought
it
on
my
own
as
im
not
much
of
a
stout
drinker
as
printed
on
the
bottle
smooth
chocolate
flavor
not
very
bitter
if
thats
your
thing
then
its
a
great
beer
just
ok
for
me
very
strong
chocolate
taste
great
beer
tasty
beer
a
must
for
any
chocolate
stout
lover
this
is
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
imagine
boiling
down
chocolate
chips
and
inhaling
a
big
whiff
of
chocolate
goodness
it
is
similar
to
the
smell
of
ssocs
with
a
hint
of
malt
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
dark
brown
brew
has
a
modest
head
that
shrinks
to
a
ring
of
small
bubbles
around
the
outside
of
my
glass
that
remaining
throughout
the
beer
the
taste
is
lead
by
chocolate
and
although
it
is
excellent
there
is
a
hint
of
something
being
off
a
fake
quality
but
i
am
being
very
picky
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
an
outstanding
beer
like
carbonated
chocolate
milk
dont
know
if
it
would
work
as
a
desert
beer
on
its
own
due
to
the
overcarbonation
but
this
paired
phenomenally
with
aldens
chocolate
chocolate
chip
ice
cream
amazing
my
new
favorite
beer
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
this
is
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
love
it
overall
a
very
good
worldclass
beer
but
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
palate
to
consider
it
one
of
my
alltime
bests
good
beer
poured
in
a
pint
and
let
it
rest
for
a
while
tastes
great
good
for
dessert
great
for
a
day
after
work
while
im
not
much
of
a
stout
fan
i
cant
help
but
love
this
beer
very
light
and
easy
mouthfeel
not
as
heavy
and
dry
as
some
stouts
and
makes
for
a
great
desert
as
much
as
it
does
a
breakfast
addition
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
chocolate
stout
and
while
it
wasnt
the
most
balanced
i
thought
those
nice
chocolate
aspects
made
up
for
it
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
rich
a
little
crisp
slightly
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
cold
weather
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
chocolate
aspect
its
very
nice
and
its
just
what
i
want
in
a
chocolate
stout
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
chocolate
stout
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
it
isnt
something
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
its
nice
for
when
i
want
my
chocolate
fix
its
now
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
its
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
beer
keep
it
up
smooth
sweet
taste
no
bitterness
at
all
its
just
liquid
goodness
poured
from
the
pint
2
7
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
opaque
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
about
two
fingers
of
khaki
foam
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
milk
chocolate
yes
milk
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
cherry
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
milk
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
malty
biscuity
taste
at
the
end
nearly
too
sweet
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
evspdcially
a
chocolate
stout
overall
decent
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
as
say
a
southern
tier
mokah
45
o
one
of
the
best
chocolate
beers
ive
ever
tasted
cant
believe
i
waited
this
long
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
another
winner
from
sam
smith
s
reasonably
priced
at
only
3something
for
the
bottle
wowvery
nice
the
scent
and
taste
scream
milk
chocolate
the
muthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
as
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were
a
bit
more
creamy
the
color
is
opaque
with
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
overall
very
nice
tadcaster
does
it
again
is
what
i
thought
as
i
slowly
sipped
this
incredible
beer
amazing
if
you
like
chocolate
stouts
or
anything
to
do
with
chocolate
and
beer
please
at
least
do
me
the
favor
and
seek
this
one
out
absolutely
amazing
smells
like
you
were
stuffing
your
nose
in
cocoa
and
tastes
just
like
the
smell
only
better
its
5
so
it
wont
knock
you
off
your
rocker
but
itll
go
down
easy
and
youll
want
more
get
it
if
you
see
it
dont
tthink
twice
i
was
really
excited
for
this
one
but
it
somehow
left
me
questioning
if
chocolate
and
beer
were
meant
to
be
together
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
18
7oz
into
a
brandy
sniffer
pours
a
dark
deep
chocolate
brown
with
2
full
fingers
of
tan
mocha
head
delicious
notes
of
rich
chocolate
override
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
lightweak
coffee
toffee
maybe
caramelized
sugar
light
and
not
as
thick
or
creamy
in
the
mouth
as
you
would
like
thin
actually
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
the
overriding
taste
being
chocolate
milk
chocolate
the
other
flavors
are
buried
underneath
they
fight
the
chocolate
but
fail
low
abv
very
drinkable
after
taste
is
chocolate
with
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
and
malts
very
smooth
delightful
wow
thats
it
in
a
nutshell
jet
black
in
low
light
the
glass
shows
dark
ruby
brown
clarity
when
held
up
to
a
brighter
illumination
an
egg
cream
like
head
of
prodigious
proportions
rises
up
majestically
leaving
thick
layers
of
lace
after
a
flow
fade
as
i
drink
the
glass
shows
streaks
and
spots
the
brew
has
a
light
covering
that
stays
nose
is
bordering
on
criminally
chocolate
a
perfect
melding
of
stout
and
and
cacao
it
has
a
lovely
sweetness
that
makes
you
think
the
cup
should
have
steam
rising
up
and
a
marshmallow
melting
down
inside
the
taste
follows
suit
luscious
chocolate
slathered
on
top
of
a
lightly
roasty
glass
of
sweet
stout
mild
earthy
finish
leaves
more
chocolate
and
some
traditional
samuel
smith
yeast
and
water
flavors
light
stout
graininess
lingering
giving
a
dark
sweet
roll
laced
with
cocoa
a
full
velvety
creaminess
that
envelopes
the
mouth
has
you
sipping
and
savoring
and
back
again
as
soon
as
you
can
bear
it
goes
too
fast
but
luckily
its
only
five
percent
if
you
like
southern
tier
choklat
but
wish
for
a
more
sessionable
brew
your
ship
has
come
in
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
year
so
far
for
me
i
dont
get
it
a
score
of
94
and
this
might
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
its
like
they
threw
in
random
amounts
of
chocolate
cocoa
malt
sugar
spice
and
everything
nice
and
just
went
with
it
more
power
to
them
if
so
many
people
like
it
but
my
experience
with
this
was
horrible
i
drainpoured
it
after
two
ounces
or
so
best
chocolate
stout
a
must
try
i
never
give
out
a
5
for
taste
but
thid
is
literally
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
ever
had
totally
recomend
it
i
only
wish
it
had
a
higher
alch
to
pick
a
con
a
ot
of
chocolat
mayer
tot
much
o
im
reviewing
this
as
a
sweet
stout
far
too
sweet
for
any
other
style
but
very
good
for
what
it
is
excellent
dessert
beer
classic
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
great
beer
tasted
okay
but
was
had
a
thin
feel
when
i
drank
this
is
the
second
organic
ive
tried
that
had
a
similar
thin
feel
look
opaque
no
light
gets
thru
this
baby
tan
head
quickly
dissipates
and
then
rings
around
the
glass
i
love
a
large
frothy
head
especially
on
my
stouts
and
that
is
the
only
disappointment
here
smell
awesome
high
quality
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
cream
no
hops
here
taste
great
you
get
some
nice
dark
chocolate
with
a
roasted
malt
character
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
chocolate
lovers
dream
low
abv
keeps
this
nice
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
luscious
and
creamy
a
slight
carbonation
at
the
end
sip
and
enjoy
this
fine
import
overwhelming
artificial
dark
chocolate
extremely
sweet
both
this
is
a
beer
drinker
that
loves
chocolate
dream
this
would
not
be
an
every
day
stout
but
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
crack
one
open
youll
be
sad
when
you
realize
you
have
none
left
this
beer
tastes
delicious
with
that
in
mind
it
does
not
have
a
lot
of
real
beer
bite
to
it
it
would
be
perfect
with
a
stronger
stout
flavor
its
surprising
how
much
this
beer
tastes
like
chocolate
milk
and
not
beer
its
delicious
but
i
would
like
more
of
a
stout
flavor
and
a
higher
abv
o
pretty
damn
awesome
beer
that
is
exactly
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
great
beer
for
the
chocolate
lovers
out
there
this
is
as
close
to
chocolate
milk
as
beer
should
ever
be
in
the
best
way
possible
does
not
taste
like
beer
its
kind
of
a
dessert
i
feel
myself
getting
fat
just
drinking
it
very
good
rather
have
a
milk
stout
o
excellent
chocolate
stout
awesome
desert
beer
the
closest
thing
to
chocolate
milk
in
beer
form
that
i
have
experienced
super
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
next
to
no
bitterness
or
an
overpowering
cocoa
flavor
overall
im
not
even
a
fan
of
gimmicky
chocolate
stouts
but
this
is
one
done
right
you
can
tell
its
organic
just
by
smelling
and
tasting
it
none
of
that
artificial
flavoring
some
breweries
are
guilty
of
this
is
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
to
people
who
dont
even
like
beer
in
fact
my
brother
who
isnt
in
to
beer
but
takes
sips
of
mine
tasted
this
and
immediately
said
its
his
favorite
beer
to
date
its
the
perfect
dessert
beer
and
imagine
it
going
perfectly
with
chocolate
truffels
or
something
this
is
what
i
will
judge
all
chocolate
beers
by
from
now
on
o
great
beer
it
doesnt
overpower
you
on
the
coconut
front
but
delivers
plenty
of
it
to
make
any
mounds
lovers
happy
i
dont
like
sweet
stouts
i
dont
like
coconut
in
my
beer
i
love
3
hour
tour
they
nail
this
beer
its
like
drinking
a
mounds
bar
but
not
too
sweet
not
overwhelmingly
coconutty
i
honestly
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
beer
but
loved
it
it
was
only
1
of
4
that
i
had
multiple
pours
of
worthy
of
hype
o
super
smooth
and
sweet
a
delight
to
drink
served
with
a
thin
finger
of
beige
head
topping
off
a
dark
brown
brew
aroma
is
first
and
foremost
coconut
followed
up
with
sweet
chocolate
dessert
is
served
taste
is
like
the
aroma
all
i
can
think
of
is
this
is
a
like
a
liquefied
mounds
bar
with
minimal
sweetness
absolutely
delicious
each
drink
is
as
exciting
as
the
first
an
amazing
beer
carbonation
is
light
which
works
well
for
this
beer
body
is
silky
but
not
at
all
overpowering
this
is
easily
the
best
milk
stout
i
have
had
well
worth
the
hype
too
busy
enjoying
this
beer
to
take
good
notes
this
is
an
easy
one
to
ratei
know
ill
be
getting
at
least
one
of
these
every
time
i
find
it
on
tap
at
one
of
the
town
hall
locations
coconut
coconut
with
a
trace
of
coconut
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
proprietors
every
time
overall
good
but
im
clearly
missing
the
hype
top
milk
stout
for
sure
o
this
was
a
great
milk
stout
that
found
the
perfect
balance
between
sweetness
and
creaminess
after
being
in
the
growler
for
almost
a
month
this
beer
held
up
fairly
well
in
every
aspect
except
the
retention
of
the
head
and
a
slight
loss
of
carbonation
but
other
then
that
it
tasted
and
smelled
fantastic
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
especially
if
you
like
sweet
milk
chocolate
that
isnt
too
rich
overall
unique
and
absolutely
delicious
probably
the
best
feel
ive
come
across
and
that
coconut
fantastic
thanks
again
ryan
perhaps
my
favorite
part
about
three
hour
tour
is
how
the
roast
feels
like
it
melts
away
into
a
coconut
taste
worth
tracking
down
thanks
for
shipping
gord
big
thanks
goes
out
to
cassino
for
sharing
this
one
during
the
one
year
anniversary
of
my
wreck
tasting
and
to
mbrausen
for
sending
it
to
him
served
from
growler
into
a
crooked
stave
crooked
line
tulip
poured
pitch
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
coconut
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
cream
coconut
subtle
roasted
malt
and
bread
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
great
brew
as
stated
in
a
few
other
reviews
including
aasher
who
was
drinking
off
the
same
growler
think
mounds
that
pretty
much
nails
the
aroma
almost
exactly
the
flavor
was
very
nice
as
well
with
a
very
nice
sweetness
aspect
going
on
loads
of
coconut
going
on
in
both
areas
wish
it
would
have
been
a
little
thicker
on
the
mouthfeel
to
take
it
up
another
notch
very
well
done
brew
that
i
would
suggest
to
any
craft
beer
veteran
or
n00bie
alike
been
after
this
one
for
a
full
year
finally
landed
a
growler
and
was
disappointed
across
the
board
aroma
lacked
depth
showing
minimal
vanilla
and
only
traces
of
coconut
taste
is
similarly
shallow
begs
for
more
lactose
coconut
and
overall
depth
of
flavor
last
snow
puts
three
hour
tour
to
shame
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
loads
of
coconut
but
not
so
much
that
i
cant
taste
the
rest
of
it
a
stunning
delicious
dessert
of
a
beer
i
dont
even
really
like
coconut
that
much
but
its
so
fine
and
gentle
in
this
beer
that
i
cant
help
but
enjoy
it
cost
18
for
a
64
oz
growler
m
medium
bodied
drinks
easy
absolutely
wonderful
i
could
easily
take
down
two
full
growlers
of
this
for
myself
great
balance
in
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
dream
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
one
and
this
rates
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
style
this
one
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
beige
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
coconut
and
milk
chocolate
with
an
ever
so
slight
roast
wowzers
so
much
coconut
the
flavors
too
are
full
of
chocolaty
coconut
aka
mounds
it
isnt
complex
but
damn
is
it
effective
it
drinks
kind
of
light
in
body
with
an
off
dry
finish
its
a
really
easy
light
yet
sweet
stout
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
im
glad
it
was
as
advertised
o
not
sure
here
i
think
this
one
went
bad
but
i
have
nothing
else
to
compare
it
to
here
barely
drinkable
pours
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
roast
malt
chocolate
and
coconut
quite
good
but
given
the
way
some
people
have
raved
about
the
smell
not
quite
up
to
that
level
flavor
however
is
quite
fantastic
i
absolutely
love
coconut
and
this
is
incorporates
it
into
the
roasty
and
chocolate
flavors
so
well
it
manages
to
taste
like
a
candy
bar
without
being
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
damn
tasty
and
doesnt
disappoint
it
manages
not
to
be
a
gimmick
beer
despite
the
fun
flavors
overall
a
very
interesting
and
well
made
beer
worth
seeking
out
if
they
make
it
again
o
if
you
like
coconut
and
chocolate
you
will
love
this
not
the
best
drinkability
since
it
is
a
dessert
beer
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
smells
amazing
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
maybe
not
something
for
everyday
but
a
very
tasty
treat
overall
a
very
good
milksweet
stout
a
sweet
dessert
beer
that
is
big
on
flavor
but
manages
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
the
coconut
brings
a
nice
kick
draft
at
the
brewery
black
pour
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
up
front
chocolate
and
coconut
flavor
is
just
blatant
coconut
with
a
bit
of
lactose
and
chocolate
behind
finishes
too
sweet
extremely
cloying
yet
good
carbonation
i
couldnt
finish
even
half
of
my
pint
this
beer
is
far
too
sweet
i
have
a
feeling
a
5
ounce
glass
would
have
been
a
much
better
serving
size
but
even
that
might
be
a
bit
much
even
for
a
dessert
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
eat
a
mounds
bar
and
i
sure
dont
want
to
drink
the
liquid
form
of
it
o
one
of
the
best
beers
at
abr
if
you
like
coconut
beers
this
is
a
must
try
not
sure
if
i
could
consume
this
is
large
amounts
due
to
how
rich
it
is
but
still
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
had
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
after
being
somewhat
disappointed
with
mango
mama
and
czar
jack
i
was
hesitant
to
trade
for
any
more
of
their
special
beers
this
one
however
really
wowed
me
and
i
loved
that
it
was
so
unique
and
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
before
the
coconut
was
so
good
in
it
and
complimented
the
sweet
stout
flavors
perfectly
for
the
style
id
definitely
say
that
this
is
a
new
favorite
of
the
style
for
me
not
being
a
big
coconut
fan
i
was
completely
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
one
o
a
really
nice
accomplishment
with
the
coconut
milk
on
this
one
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
coconut
so
the
fact
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
speaks
volumes
to
how
well
it
was
crafted
the
blend
of
flavors
here
is
expertly
done
and
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
stouts
ive
had
in
recent
memory
especially
considering
how
complex
it
is
very
good
on
tap
at
town
hall
tap
this
beer
arrives
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
solid
inch
of
brown
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coconut
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
like
drinking
a
mounds
bar
but
better
i
will
make
it
a
point
of
finding
this
beer
whenever
it
is
available
o
this
beer
was
really
great
i
wouldnt
want
to
polish
off
a
whole
growler
of
it
as
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
but
this
is
the
best
use
of
coconut
ive
seen
in
a
beer
yet
very
flavorful
highly
recommended
body
was
light
to
medium
surprisingly
so
for
a
milk
stout
which
i
though
would
be
a
bit
thicker
some
decent
carbonation
from
the
growler
pour
decent
for
a
porter
without
being
excessively
bubbly
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
toasted
coconut
o
i
would
give
a
lot
to
try
this
one
again
i
would
not
have
had
a
problem
finishing
the
entire
growler
myself
this
one
is
a
step
above
maui
coconut
porter
there
was
so
much
going
right
in
this
beer
it
was
sweet
milky
creamy
chocolately
coconuty
everything
a
mounds
bar
is
thanks
again
josh
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
looks
the
part
coconut
fills
the
glass
and
really
brings
out
the
light
chocolate
flavors
as
well
smells
really
enticing
the
taste
is
fantastic
especially
when
it
warms
a
bit
strong
coconut
is
well
integrated
into
a
light
slightly
chocolatey
stout
this
has
much
more
coconut
flavor
than
maui
coconut
porter
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointing
really
thin
and
light
i
think
this
beer
would
be
an
epic
homerun
if
it
had
some
of
the
creaminess
that
really
brings
around
the
style
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
really
fantastic
that
suffers
from
only
one
flaw
that
said
i
could
absolutely
drink
a
ton
of
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
nice
light
brown
head
looks
great
smells
sweet
and
malty
not
a
lot
going
on
on
the
nose
tastes
very
very
coconut
heavy
a
nice
chocolatey
sweetness
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
well
carbonated
overall
the
coconut
is
phenomenal
very
enjoyable
brew
i
dont
want
to
bust
up
anyones
trade
bait
but
this
is
a
good
wellcrafted
beer
with
a
very
pretty
twist
very
good
but
not
elite
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
try
it
whats
great
about
this
no
holds
barred
doesnt
hold
back
but
neither
goes
too
far
perfect
balance
not
subtle
in
the
cocoanut
flavor
delivers
it
all
in
just
the
right
amount
just
about
perfect
yu
um
o
awesome
beer
the
sweet
milk
stout
body
works
well
with
the
coconut
and
dark
roast
to
form
an
awesome
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
coconut
beer
i
have
ever
had
o
really
enjoyable
and
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
thanks
to
mike
for
sending
this
one
down
to
me
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
in
the
future
another
winner
from
th
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
an
exceptionally
smooth
feel
it
is
lightly
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
if
sweet
brews
are
your
thing
there
was
seemingly
no
alcohol
heat
here
just
a
faint
twang
of
alcohol
flavoring
not
really
roasted
or
grainy
this
was
seriously
a
beer
version
of
mounds
candy
bars
if
you
enjoy
that
sort
of
chocolate
candy
approach
to
this
style
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
this
was
one
of
the
more
memorable
and
unique
brews
i
have
had
in
awhile
while
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
very
much
of
this
before
the
sweetness
got
to
me
diabetics
beware
overallprobably
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
now
town
hall
is
the
king
of
coconut
porter
and
i
have
had
maui
brewing
as
well
o
a
delicious
beer
the
lack
of
body
was
somewhat
disappointing
but
if
you
like
coconut
this
is
a
must
try
the
taste
is
everything
you
expect
after
smelling
the
coconut
after
a
quick
swirl
of
the
glass
there
is
a
nice
nutty
element
and
toasty
tinges
which
give
a
sweet
vanilla
backing
to
the
coconuts
almost
floral
flavor
very
clean
and
has
a
moderate
level
of
sweetness
to
achieve
a
nice
balance
this
is
more
about
the
coconut
than
the
base
stout
which
is
a
little
lost
in
all
the
coconut
flavor
but
i
enjoyed
the
way
it
came
together
and
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
coconut
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
time
i
was
not
let
down
this
beer
is
so
easy
drinking
its
scary
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
huge
coconut
and
chocolate
flavors
come
out
perfect
dessert
beer
point
blank
if
you
dont
like
coconut
i
suggest
passing
on
this
if
you
do
like
it
i
would
say
this
is
like
a
liquid
mounds
bar
truly
wonderful
o
a
mos
def
must
try
very
good
beer
you
must
like
coconut
cuz
its
a
coco
nut
punch
to
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
extremely
smooth
and
silky
the
lactose
makes
a
nice
heavier
body
and
definitely
adds
some
stickiness
to
your
lips
very
well
crafted
but
i
could
only
have
one
pint
per
sitting
the
coconut
flavor
would
become
too
much
for
me
what
a
great
beer
i
finally
opened
my
growler
from
oct
and
it
let
out
a
nice
little
hiss
as
it
opened
pours
jet
black
and
viscous
with
next
to
zero
head
i
had
this
one
on
tap
when
it
came
out
too
and
i
dont
remember
it
having
much
of
a
head
at
that
point
either
smells
of
sweet
coconut
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
an
explosion
yet
so
smooth
i
think
it
was
even
better
out
of
the
growler
with
a
couple
of
month
on
it
the
coconut
took
a
small
step
back
and
allowed
the
chocolatly
malt
and
roasted
flavors
to
take
a
stronger
part
in
the
flavor
people
describe
it
as
drinking
a
mounds
bar
and
its
not
too
far
from
the
truth
this
thing
simply
coats
your
mouth
and
envelops
all
of
your
senses
with
a
roasted
chocolatecoconutvanilla
smootheness
i
could
drink
this
on
and
on
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
a
growler
might
be
a
bit
much
in
a
day
but
i
didnt
want
to
waste
any
of
this
delicious
treat
the
chocolate
and
bourbon
characteristics
come
out
really
well
in
the
flavor
ultra
smooth
and
tasty
good
notes
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
roast
as
well
as
some
light
cherry
and
toasted
coconut
really
enjoying
this
very
nice
feel
between
the
bourbon
and
a
bit
of
booze
perfect
carbonation
level
a
really
nice
brew
that
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
up
and
as
i
went
through
a
few
small
glasses
well
done
th
d
having
only
a
sip
of
this
would
be
like
only
eating
one
m
m
who
the
hell
does
that
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
milk
stout
not
as
much
coconut
as
i
expected
but
i
liked
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
would
like
to
try
again
sometime
personal
note
at
the
time
of
this
review
this
beer
is
a
milk
sweet
stout
and
not
on
the
top
sweet
stout
list
due
to
lack
of
reviews
d
terrific
stuff
but
probably
best
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
d
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
wonderful
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
every
last
sip
is
delicious
this
is
worth
trying
get
it
on
draft
if
you
can
i
had
a
growler
that
was
a
week
or
two
old
and
the
brightness
of
the
flavors
dropped
considerably
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
beer
nearly
as
much
as
i
did
a
very
good
base
stout
is
key
here
as
is
the
fact
that
the
coconut
influence
isnt
overpowering
a
huge
flavor
profile
in
a
relatively
small
abv
that
is
well
worth
a
shot
the
palate
shows
a
touch
more
complexity
though
its
still
dominated
by
sweet
coconut
and
milk
chocolate
the
finish
brings
flavors
of
licorice
and
roasted
malt
that
help
balance
the
initial
blast
of
sweetness
but
its
decidedly
a
dessert
beer
that
said
it
never
became
cloying
even
after
several
pours
worth
trying
and
quite
unique
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
really
is
a
testament
to
what
flavors
you
can
get
in
a
beer
i
felt
that
it
was
very
well
balanced
with
nothing
too
overpowering
i
cant
give
it
a
5
on
drinkability
only
because
i
could
never
see
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
will
buy
it
again
and
again
if
i
can
find
it
i
only
wish
it
came
in
bottles
rather
than
a
whole
growler
wow
pretty
rich
stuff
cant
say
ive
had
anything
similar
and
glad
i
was
able
to
grab
one
of
these
would
rate
this
a
bit
higher
if
it
wasnt
so
mouthdrying
but
a
standout
for
the
style
if
you
like
coconut
and
chocolate
this
should
be
high
on
your
list
of
beers
to
try
a
great
tick
awesome
for
a
second
to
try
the
coconut
but
this
is
way
to
sweet
to
be
anything
than
a
46oz
sipper
d
highly
drinkable
for
something
this
dark
and
sweet
a
great
beer
that
was
very
nicely
done
ontap
at
town
hall
tap
yup
it
sure
does
taste
like
a
mounds
bar
the
coconut
character
was
richer
with
mild
toasted
notes
over
the
sweet
candy
flavors
i
dont
get
much
milk
stout
here
theres
a
chocolate
character
in
the
background
and
a
small
but
distinct
taste
of
lactose
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
frankly
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
20
oz
pint
its
a
great
dessert
beer
if
you
like
a
good
mounds
bar
or
just
like
coconut
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
flavor
that
wasnt
coconutbased
still
its
easily
the
best
coconut
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
am
having
a
hard
time
putting
my
glass
down
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
th
5
0
d
this
goes
down
super
easy
i
wasnt
sure
about
coconut
and
stout
but
it
worked
out
well
i
shared
this
with
four
other
guys
a
portion
of
me
wishes
i
just
drank
it
myself
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
decent
milk
stout
with
a
nice
twist
with
the
coconut
still
bit
more
complexity
and
less
sweetness
would
suit
me
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
their
beers
tap
ahhh
3
hour
tour
so
we
meet
again
i
have
been
craving
this
beer
ever
since
i
had
it
last
year
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
tan
1
finger
head
the
aroma
is
coconut
right
off
the
bat
and
in
your
face
followed
by
mild
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
liquid
mounds
bar
through
and
through
the
coconut
flavor
is
present
the
entire
time
but
you
also
do
get
some
dark
chocolate
vanilla
and
roast
coffee
notes
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
some
people
i
talked
to
have
said
1
is
enough
as
it
can
be
a
little
sweet
but
for
me
this
by
far
is
the
best
coconut
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
everyday
all
day
this
is
just
an
amazing
beer
that
i
could
drink
nearly
all
night
never
had
anything
like
it
if
you
like
coconut
you
must
try
this
beer
cant
say
enough
about
how
much
i
enjoy
it
very
good
d
way
too
easy
i
could
mix
this
in
with
my
ceral
i
drank
my
glass
so
fast
that
i
almost
felt
bad
and
but
again
almost
because
i
have
32oz
to
drink
should
seek
out
if
possible
d
awesome
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
i
have
come
across
incredible
dessertbeer
wish
they
would
bottle
this
many
thanks
to
ba
beerloco
for
bringing
this
to
the
tasting
overall
top
5
beers
ive
had
from
town
hall
easily
great
stuff
d
i
must
have
been
about
twoandahalf
sheets
by
the
time
i
reviewed
this
because
my
notes
indicate
that
this
is
some
yummy
ass
shit
not
exactly
overly
verbose
or
scholarly
but
definitely
the
truth
this
is
easily
competition
for
maui
coconut
porter
although
i
find
three
hour
tour
to
be
even
more
smooth
and
milky
dthis
stuff
is
maui
coconut
porter
turned
up
to
11
man
o
man
this
stuff
hits
home
with
me
and
rocks
my
world
thanks
so
much
to
adam
for
sharing
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
quaffable
a
real
treat
to
have
this
beer
is
one
of
most
expertly
crafted
beers
i
have
come
acrossed
drinkability
if
you
want
an
incredible
cocunut
stout
this
is
it
overall
this
was
just
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
no
question
in
my
mind
i
would
drink
this
everyday
if
i
could
it
was
just
perfect
drinkability
this
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
as
i
write
this
review
on
my
iphone
ive
almost
finished
two
and
thats
definitely
a
first
id
bathe
in
this
beer
if
it
was
socially
acceptable
and
money
wasnt
an
issue
this
beer
is
what
maui
coconut
porter
should
be
freaking
amazing
had
this
on
tap
at
town
hall
yesterday
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
was
gone
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
aroma
is
deep
in
your
face
chocolatycoconut
goodness
definitely
sweet
in
the
nose
plenty
of
sugary
caramel
and
nuttiness
taste
is
perfect
for
what
they
were
going
for
i
asked
if
they
had
used
toasted
coconut
but
the
bartender
assured
me
it
was
fresh
but
theres
something
about
this
brings
out
a
nice
toasty
edge
to
the
coconut
milk
chocolate
is
the
first
thing
to
smack
me
across
the
tongue
and
its
followed
up
by
a
nice
coconut
finish
roasty
nutty
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
im
even
picking
up
something
that
tastes
a
little
bit
like
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
so
damn
delicious
i
give
this
a
6
out
5
for
tastes
creamy
soft
mouthfeel
viscous
and
lightly
warming
great
beer
here
i
had
two
pints
of
it
and
that
was
enough
for
me
as
the
sweetness
did
become
a
bit
much
after
awhile
but
the
first
pint
went
down
super
easy
and
quick
fantastic
stuff
black
bodied
beer
with
a
creamy
deep
brown
head
the
head
recedes
to
a
collar
in
about
a
minute
spotty
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
incredible
milk
chocolate
and
very
light
roasted
malt
toasted
coconut
is
very
subtle
on
the
nose
i
doubt
id
pick
it
out
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
in
the
beer
hazelnut
and
mocha
and
coffee
accent
as
well
fantastic
i
pick
up
the
coconut
a
little
more
on
the
palate
with
my
first
sip
but
it
is
in
no
way
overbearing
it
really
blends
nicely
with
the
milk
stout
base
the
base
flavor
is
chocolatey
and
roasty
and
sweet
the
toasted
coconut
accents
beautifully
and
leaves
a
nice
lingering
toasted
coconut
coconut
milk
flavor
long
after
this
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
an
about
medium
in
body
very
easy
drinking
and
very
flavorful
a
one
of
a
kind
distinct
coconut
meatmilk
flavor
lightly
toasty
backed
by
some
chocolate
milk
sweetness
ultra
smooth
with
the
consistency
of
chocolate
milk
also
more
than
a
pint
would
be
overindulgence
but
one
is
just
right
well
put
together
and
far
more
than
just
a
novelty
this
was
exceptional
despite
my
hatred
for
grated
coconut
in
foods
a
texturebased
hate
the
best
coconut
beer
ive
had
to
date
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
a
ton
of
it
thanks
to
d0b
for
the
chance
d
the
sweetness
gets
a
little
overwhelming
but
the
thinner
texture
and
great
taste
make
it
pretty
easy
drinking
still
i
can
feel
my
pulse
quickening
from
the
sugar
content
so
this
is
a
one
pint
kind
of
brew
im
drinking
yet
another
gem
from
the
guys
at
town
hall
they
can
brew
some
beer
up
there
in
minneapolis
i
wouldnt
hesitate
in
buying
a
few
pints
of
this
if
i
was
sitting
at
the
brewery
right
now
on
a
chilly
night
have
to
give
it
up
to
those
guys
and
their
constant
ingenuity
with
each
release
d
good
really
tasty
beer
smooth
and
delicious
great
taste
and
reminds
me
more
of
a
cake
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
great
dessert
beer
share
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
kinda
a
weird
fake
strawberry
aftertaste
a
truly
sessionable
dessert
beer
i
could
enjoy
1
or
8
either
way
would
be
fine
chocolate
and
strawberry
stout
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
nice
sweet
milk
stout
that
might
appeal
to
even
those
who
dont
generally
enjoy
stouts
verdict
quite
the
interesting
beer
definitely
a
unique
and
spot
on
interpretation
of
neapolitan
ice
cream
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
and
the
oddly
roasted
quality
at
the
finish
doesnt
seem
to
fit
though
it
helps
to
balance
the
beer
at
least
lovers
of
a
dessert
stout
will
find
this
right
to
their
liking
pours
dark
black
with
nice
head
retention
smells
of
roasted
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
milk
taste
is
complex
starts
out
sweet
and
smooth
then
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
recommended
for
a
try
bought
4pack
in
berrien
springs
for
9
99
this
beer
is
one
the
rise
in
the
midwest
it
is
an
up
and
coming
stout
i
guilted
my
cousin
back
in
michigan
to
send
me
some
i
am
currently
nursing
the
last
of
a
six
pack
smell
this
stout
breathe
it
in
then
put
the
cap
back
on
and
mail
it
to
me
its
so
so
so
sk
medium
bodied
with
a
lighter
effervescence
come
off
as
more
of
a
porter
but
thats
picking
nits
really
good
stuff
overall
if
it
were
feasible
to
have
my
blood
replaced
with
this
then
i
probably
would
its
absolutely
amazing
sadly
it
was
a
chance
inclusion
in
a
mixed
case
of
american
beers
that
i
bought
recently
and
the
folks
that
i
got
this
from
dont
list
any
saugatuck
ales
at
all
which
is
a
pity
i
suspect
that
this
is
going
to
take
some
hunting
down
but
given
the
chance
ill
have
it
again
amazing
beer
i
couldnt
get
enough
the
beer
gets
silky
as
it
warms
balanced
coffee
chocolate
and
raspberry
only
tasted
on
tap
small
brewery
great
effort
overall
the
more
the
beer
warms
the
more
i
enjoy
it
and
the
feel
becomes
silkier
an
interesting
beer
you
should
definitely
try
once
for
yourself
warm
i
like
this
beer
and
it
does
smell
and
taste
like
neapolitan
ice
cream
but
artificial
flavor
and
color
added
really
i
guess
the
ice
cream
is
probably
artificially
flavored
also
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
craft
beer
and
this
just
feels
like
a
shortcut
scores
would
be
way
higher
if
they
could
make
this
naturally
great
aroma
must
drink
at
4550
degrees
in
order
to
pull
out
the
strawberry
and
vanilla
flavors
o
a
great
dessert
beerprob
couldnt
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
pretty
fresh
120114
if
im
reading
the
second
line
of
the
code
correctly
i
can
see
having
one
of
these
every
so
often
as
a
nice
alternative
to
a
desert
its
relatively
light
in
taste
and
body
i
have
no
idea
how
to
rate
lookit
looks
like
stout
duh
not
a
lot
of
head
anyway
yesi
thought
the
label
which
is
gorgeously
retro
and
the
name
were
a
joke
but
no
it
really
does
taste
and
smell
like
neapolitan
it
has
a
chocolateystrawberryy
taste
and
a
feel
in
the
mouth
of
dairyvanilla
and
it
is
fun
really
fun
to
drink
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
milk
stout
before
and
i
suppose
i
expected
something
stronger
and
heavier
but
this
was
fine
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
it
looks
like
a
stout
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
laces
the
glass
as
you
drink
this
truly
smells
like
neopolitan
ice
cream
the
taste
follows
with
a
light
strawberry
creaminess
blending
perfectly
with
the
roasted
malttextbook
stout
flavor
that
dominates
but
doesnt
overpower
smoother
and
less
bitter
than
most
stouts
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
balance
is
perfect
wow
is
this
my
new
favorite
stout
very
well
done
very
sweet
desert
style
milk
stout
overall
too
sweet
for
me
but
coupled
with
some
cheesecake
or
similar
desert
would
be
good
delicious
full
bodied
stout
with
hints
of
chocolate
strawberry
and
vanilla
just
like
the
label
says
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
flavor
but
its
not
enough
to
detract
from
richness
of
the
stout
itself
o
for
a
dessert
beer
or
as
a
stout
refuge
away
from
the
relentless
and
unending
array
of
hopforward
beers
out
there
this
is
quite
tasty
will
repeat
creamy
taste
smooth
finish
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
poured
from
a
chilled
12oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
aroma
fits
the
spirit
of
the
beer
perfectly
although
the
stawberry
is
a
little
on
the
artificial
side
tastes
of
a
wonderful
mixture
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
strawberry
again
the
stawberry
reminded
me
of
freeze
dried
stawberry
ice
cream
instead
of
fresh
strawberries
but
i
think
this
plays
into
the
neapolitan
theme
wonderful
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
wow
great
beer
saugatuck
pours
an
opaque
with
ecru
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
carried
hints
of
chocolate
strawberry
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
a
nice
medium
bodied
stout
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
artificial
strawberry
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
dont
get
the
high
rating
good
sweet
stout
not
cloying
or
overpowering
sweetness
o
not
too
bad
the
strawberry
comes
through
the
most
and
the
chocolate
is
more
of
a
coffee
but
pretty
decent
overall
this
is
a
bitter
synthetic
mess
that
isnt
worth
the
time
to
try
just
caught
the
end
of
the
keg
and
the
2
ounces
i
had
was
pretty
good
will
look
forward
to
a
second
chance
with
this
beer
this
starts
off
rough
around
the
edges
at
first
but
everything
basically
comes
together
at
the
end
this
is
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
i
went
into
this
thinking
i
would
love
it
but
i
ended
up
just
liking
it
it
even
had
moments
when
i
was
questioning
it
but
i
give
them
credit
for
this
one
they
basically
deliver
exactly
what
they
advertised
it
ultimately
reminds
me
of
neapolitan
ice
cream
quite
weird
i
think
this
is
actually
what
they
intended
but
it
truly
tastes
like
icecream
not
convinced
i
like
it
but
its
definitely
something
to
try
o
this
is
the
adult
version
of
neopolitan
ice
cream
while
it
leans
heavy
on
the
strawberry
there
is
enough
balance
to
make
this
an
above
average
milk
stout
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
much
it
tasted
like
neapolitan
ice
cream
o
sure
it
is
gimmicky
idea
for
a
beer
but
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
neapolitan
beer
milkshake
the
strawberry
flavor
is
definitely
reminiscent
of
the
the
little
ice
cream
cups
with
the
wooden
spoons
but
in
this
case
i
dont
mind
that
artificial
taste
thanks
to
my
buddy
mike
for
this
one
a
pitch
black
pour
with
a
finger
or
so
of
creamy
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
indeed
as
advertised
milk
chocolate
vanilla
red
berries
and
caramel
with
a
whiff
of
ash
the
sweet
cream
and
berry
notes
become
more
prominent
as
one
sips
although
the
opposite
is
true
on
the
palate
with
the
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
notes
increasing
in
salience
this
crossover
effect
between
nose
and
palate
added
to
the
experience
to
me
perhaps
the
strawberry
is
overdone
although
the
sweet
cream
vanilla
coffee
and
caramel
elements
gave
me
something
else
on
which
to
focus
and
there
was
a
robust
charred
barley
note
poking
out
that
prevented
things
from
becoming
too
sweet
i
am
reminded
of
dehydrated
astronaut
ice
cream
rather
than
the
stuff
in
the
big
yellow
bucket
wonderful
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
and
rich
but
not
overly
thick
finishes
with
faint
grassy
hops
and
light
ash
quite
tasty
all
told
with
some
childhood
nostalgia
thrown
in
for
good
measure
its
true
you
can
smell
and
taste
a
hint
of
strawberries
fun
labeling
on
the
bottle
too
it
tastes
exactly
like
it
should
vanilla
chocolate
strawberry
and
sweet
nice
little
stout
smells
like
if
you
mixed
together
all
the
flavors
in
the
carton
of

by
the
strawberry
artificial
strawberry
up
front
with
a
lingering
chocolate
bitterness
in
back
this
is
just
ok
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
a
pleasant
enough
rendition
of
a
milk
stout
one
which
well
captures
the
essence
of
that
youthful
ice
cream
treat
too
bad
then
like
many
of
those
4l
pails
of
yore
im
sure
that
artificial
flavours
are
listed
as
an
ingredient
a
most
excellent
effort
i
love
this
beer
and
am
glad
to
see
it
back
in
distribution
in
toledo
a

ing
love
this
beer
amazingly
delicious
and
sweet
best
on

taste
all

phenomenal
this
beer
is
great
enjoyed
it
at
whole
foods
while
shopping
a
while
back
served
on
nitro
cant
wait
for
it
to
be
back
in
distribution
this
fall
love
it
had
this
beer
at
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
in
chicago
and
was
extremely
surprised
at
how
complex
the
flavors
were
in
this
beer
it
tasted
just
like
the
ice
cream
had
to
get
a
few
refills
on
this
one
the
body
was
medium
density
and
creamy
adequate
carbonation
smooth
and
well
carbonated
but
not
too
crisp
this
beer
has
a
nice
body
a
certain
robustness
without
being
huge
and
a
great
creamy
feel
overall
didnt
expect
it
to
be
outstanding
and
would
call
it
so
i
am
a
beer
snob
and
brewery
owner
who
is
not
ashamed
to
say
this
novelty
beer
is
a
great

and
very

to

a

odecent

the
strawberry
flavor
is
a
little

artificial
this
stout
had
just
the
right
amount
of
the
fruity
strawberry
and
vanilla
that
i
expected
perfect

on
the

i
had
it
at
about
50

f
the

was
exceptional
the
finish
was
nice
not

malty
or
hoppy
carbonation
was
just
a

too
much
it
is

of

i
even
liked

overall
a
very
tasty
take
on
a
rich
chocolate
milk
stout
with
the
addition
of

this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
and
makes
for
a
wonderful

poured

in

again
dark

and
cocoa
were
dominant
moderately
roasty
with
a

nothing

came
out

this
was
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
milk
stout
not
usually
my
favorite
style
to
me
the
coffee
flavors
were
so
forward
they
tended
to
overpower
any
of
the
neapolitan
that
the
brewer
was
looking
for
overall
a
decent
beer

but
at
the
sacrifice
of
making
a
good
beer
in
actuality
it
is
kind
of
a
sweet
mess
of
a
beer
although
they
could
stand
to
tweak
the
recipe
a
bit
to
achieve
better
balance

great

nice
color
and
nice
dark
head
when
poured
o
a
good
milk
stout
simple
and
to
the
point
and
well
balanced
got
it
because
the
quirky
packaging
caught
my
eye
was
not
disappointed
its
an
oddly
smooth
for
how
thick
it
is
and
its
got
an
amazing
foam
to
it
so
smooth
i
cant
remember
another
stout
thats
gone
down
so
easy
great
beer
would
buy
again
i
really
enjoy
the
creaminess
of
this
beer

pours
dark

with

and
little

smells
of
toffy
and

light
on
the
tongue
but
decent
roasted
flavors
linger
with
no
discernable
alcohol
very
tasty
overall
very
nice
notsosweet
sweet
stout
better
than
their
popular
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
a
tolerable
cheap
beer
what
i
got
was
a
surprisingly
pleasant
cheap
beer
a
little
sweet
a
little
roasty
no
hops
to
speak
of
this
ones
pretty
simple
and
goes
down
easy
and
aint
nothing
wrong
with
that
overall
a
rather
tasty
somewhat
but
not
overly
driermilk
stout
which
packs
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
into
a
little
bit
of
abv
this
is
a
rather
nice
more
winter
style
sessionable
brew
just
plain
good
also
love
the
cans
impressive
milk
stout
moo
thunder
will
be
on
the
shopping
list
for
future
beer
runs
as
long
as
i
see
it
in
orange
county
o
the
nose
gave
it
away
with
its
lack
of
luster
the
flavor
profiles
are
pleasing
but
far
too
subtle
the
mouthfeel
is
the
final
straw
its
too
light
too
watery
honestly
one
of
the
first
beers
i
feel
i
can
clearly
identify
the
influence
of
the
water
used
in
the
brewing
process
not
terrible
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
milk
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
vanilla
and
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
char
and
slight
cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
flavors
in
this
one
are
quite
char
forward
to
me
this
is
a
quite
tasty
stout
in
fact
im
having
trouble
typing
this
review
because
i
keep
grabbing
my
glass
instead
this
is
the
to
me
perfect
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
such
that
i
cant
taste
any
hops
only
their
closing
bitterness
so
far
this
is
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
butternuts
o
a
very
simple
stout
it
imparts
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
characteristic
of
most
stouts
however
the
lack
of
complexity
may
turn
off
beer
aficionados
that
are
used
to
thick
complex
stouts
that
linger
on
the
palate
o
a
decent
everyday
stout
that
id
try
again
far
from
the
best
of
the
style
but
definitely
worth
a
try
o
i
had
hoped
for
this
to
be
a
winner
i
am
always
pulling
for
beer
from
my
area
this
is
an
okay
brew
but
not
my
favorite
in
this
category
overall
this
is
honestly
way
better
than
i
expected
ive
had
pork
slap
pale
ale
and
was
thoroughly
underwhelmed
but
this
stout
is
pretty
excellent
its
not
the
best
milk
stout
in
the
world
but
its
near
the
top
of
my
budget
beer
list
o
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
its
a
good
balance
between
the
roast
and
sweetness
not
much
depth
but
this
is
simply
a
milk
stout
o
not
bad
not
memorable
ok
if
you
have
no
interest
in
the
extreme
stout
arms
race
then
this
is
a
beer
for
you
if
you
are
a
veteran
of
those
beers
however
youll
probably
find
moo
thunder
a
bit
bland
a
very
sessionable
milk
stout
simple
but
still
exciting
to
drink
overall
this
tastes
like
a
stout
its
a
fine
light
tasty
stout
but
not
like
a
saison
or
usual
farmhouse
ale
also
while
its
good
will
not
be
craving
it
any
time
soon
overall
a
nice
well
balanced
very
drinkable
stout
not
really
remarkable
in
any
way
other
than
how
well
rounded
it
is
worth
picking
up
a
can
a
really
underappreciated
stout
here
the
best
of
both
words
as
it
has
some
light
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
also
a
bitter
malt
profile
that
balances
this
brew
perfectly
dense
dark
brown
from
the
can
rising
pillowy
tan
head
great
lacing
i
smell
cocoa
powder
and
vanilla
both
subtle
but
there
behind
dense
chocolate
malt
bitter
barley
and
a
touch
of
char
the
taste
is
much
less
aggressive
and
angry
than
the
nose
with
the
lactose
sugar
really
bringing
this
together
beautifully
especially
in
the
finish
which
is
soft
and
rich
desserty
without
being
diabetic
huge
body
but
an
unbelievably
delicate
feel
creamy
and
velvety
on
my
palate
and
finishing
clean
and
satisfying
scary
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
to
me
a
beautiful
example
of
a
style
that
is
often
tried
and
infrequently
executed
well
this
is
really
a
lot
better
than
its
scores
indicate
here
one
of
new
yorks
hidden
treasures
o
great
milk
stout
no
part
is
more
overpowering
than
the
others
very
enjoyable
this
actually
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
while
youngs
can
be
quite
offensive
in
flavor
this
packs
tons
of
flavor
for
a
4
9
abv
beer
im
really
happy
with
having
tried
this
not
my
favorite
stoutporter
but
a
really
good
session
option
overall
a
decent
sweet
stout
a
really
nice
session
stout
which
ill
be
visiting
again
soon
o
a
winner
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
but
very
pleasantly
drinkable
it
pours
a
dark
opaque
black
with
a
datk
brown
frothy
head
with
large
bubbles
it
has
some
particles
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
has
a
slight
bready
smell
with
a
little
booze
in
the
nose
as
well
i
get
a
lot
of
spur
which
makes
me
wonder
if
this
batch
was
a
little
off
i
was
expecting
more
malty
taste
it
has
a
decent
body
and
decent
carbonation
i
want
to
try
a
different
batch
of
this
beer
at
another
date
but
if
this
is
how
this
beer
usually
tastes
i
would
not
recommend
over
some
of
the
others
that
are
better
this
is
a
strange
beer
it
has
some
notes
that
indicate
a
milk
stout
but
it
also
has
some
strange
off
notes
the
tart
finish
is
definitely
off
putting
the
faint
citrusy
character
is
also
a
bit
off
putting
i
think
the
citrus
could
work
but
it
seems
to
accompany
the
tartness
in
the
finish
which
i
think
is
what
makes
it
unwelcomed
im
not
sure
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
get
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
overall
its
slightly
below
average
for
me
i
see
that
people
are
raving
about
it
but
i
need
to
be
honestit
isnt
a
taste
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
with
so
many
good
milk
stouts
out
there
these
days
i
will
pass
on
moo
thunder
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
sessionable
milk
stout
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
stands
out
as
smooth
satiny
and
surprisingly
light
without
being
watery
the
dominant
smell
is
sweet
dark
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malt
taste
is
simple
a
bit
of
milky
sweetness
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
tasty
roasted
character
nothing
overwhelming
but
overwhelmingly
pleasant
throughout
a
great
session
stout
and
you
cant
beat
it
at
8
a
6
pack
oouch
this
is
just
horrible
its
actually
gross
its
sour
not
a
good
sour
the
sort
of
sour
that
old
milk
is
yuck
going
down
the
drain
o
this
was
a
decent
stout
that
i
would
have
again
o
a
nice
stout
in
a
can
good
flavors
but
it
was
a
little
thin
o
this
starts
off
well
and
if
it
was
described
as
a
dry
stout
i
may
have
rated
it
higher
its
not
entirely
unpleasant
to
drink
but
im
just
not
sure
butternuts
knows
what
theyre
doing
so
im
docking
them
for
the
incorrect
description
of
this
beer
style
a
very
nice
beer
and
great
way
to
end
my
variety
pack
would
definitely
have
it
again
odsurprisingly
good
i
have
avoided
this
beer
and
all
beers
by
butternuts
after
this
i
feel
as
though
i
may
need
to
try
some
others
by
butternuts
this
is
neat
beer
in
a
cool
can
far
exceeded
my
expectations
notes

solid
and
drinkable
cheers
moo

stout
pours
a
solid
black
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
caramel
foam
crowning
the
beer
theres
decent
head
retention
on
display
as
well
as
some
lightly
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
smells
of
light
sweet
coffee
with
a
slightly
heavy
roast
edge
to
it
the
flavor
profile
retains
that
coffee
note
but
leans
a
little
bit
heavier
on
the
roast
the
result
is
that
the
taste
comes
across
as
a
little
too
dry
and
roasty
at
times
the
body
is
solidy
full
especially
for
a
low
abv
beer
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
creamy
though
and
is
paired
with
a
slightly
overactive
carbonation
moo

is
a
passable

than
the

had
before
from
butternuts
o
decent
given
its
style
and
smooth
but
lacks
complexity
and
flavorfragrance
intensity
o
not
impressed
by
any
means
overall
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
keeps
it
nice
and
simple
which
makes
it
refreshing
great
to
either
start
or
end
a
night
had
this
on
cask
but
id
like
to
try
the
canned
product
hopefully
it
is
just
as
good
decent
milk
stout
nice
texture
very
light
slainte
like
many
milk
stouts
it
doesnt
wow
or
break
boundaries
but
its
solid
and
satisfies
that
craving
for
a
lighter
stout
the
price
and
can
format
are
pluses
definitely
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
it
deep
roasty
stout
nicely
carbonated
that
creates
a
slightly
bitter
dry
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
with
hints
of
chocolate
biscuit
and
herbal
character
overall
loved
it
maybe
my
go
to
cold
weatherdessert
beer
poured
at
the
local
bar
huzzah
ill
be
the
first
to
review
it
on
tap
sadly
its
sort
of
underwhelming
it
seems
like
the
beer
went
sour
burnt
chocolate
taste
is
still
there
like
it
was
in
the
can
but
not
really
much
in
the
creamy
stout
department
such
a
disappointment
o
another
extremely
sessionable
beer
by
butternuts
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
as
per
the
style
but
aside
from
that
this
is
an
above
average
milk
stout
and
it
comes
in
a
can
sweet
o
a
wellcrafted
stout
that
is
less
sweet
and
more
smokey
than
average
for
style
for
your
own
good
do
not
drink
this
ice
cold
or
directly
out
of
the
can
overall
a
decent
milk
stout
to
come
out
of
a
can
you
dont
too
much
of
these
here
on
the
east
coast
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
short
lineup
of
them
i
could
revisit
this
again
in
the
future
most
certainly
worth
a
try
a
really
nice
tasty
stout
its
an
unseasonably
cool
january
evening
in
nyc
opposed
to
a
bitter
cold
january
evening
and
this
is
the
perfect
match
for
my
wifes
beef
stew
very
good
milk
stout
this
is
an
ok
stout
especially
for
the
price
point
9
99
for
a
six
pack
on
long
island
that
said
id
probably
look
elsewhere
for
something
that
has
stronger
milk
stout
characteristics
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
frothy
light
foamy
light
brown
head
that
is
roughly
a
half
an
inch
and
it
clings
to
the
glass
like
crazy
mild
chocolate
tones
sweeten
up
the
toasted
barley
backbone
and
the
smooth
malty
presence
flavors
are
light
and
mild
on
a
slick
thin
body
smokey
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
throughout
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
that
balances
everything
out
nicely
the
aftertaste
is
more
on
the
coffee
side
with
some
roast
and
bitter
qualities
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
the
mouth
quickly
with
a
slight
astringency
from
all
the
bitter
qualities
good
solid
stout
overall
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
stout
that
i
could
drink
multiple
of
in
one
sitting
but
does
not
blow
me
away
enough
to
purchase
if
i
had
other
options
overy
enjoyable
not
jaw
dropping
but
very
delicious
overall
smooth
and
straightforward
but
it
is
difficult
to
identify
the
flavor
profile
as
none
of
the
flavors
truly
present
themselves
fully
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
not
memorable
either
d
rich
cocoa
lactose
sweetness
but
also
nicely
roasty
not
complex
but
impressive
depth
very
solid
everyday
stout
highly
drinkable
overall
a
decent
good
stout
definitely
on
the
burned
side
o
the
first
impressive
offering
that
ive
found
in
this
4pack
which
is
now
finished
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
modest
tan
head
smells
megaroasty
almost
burnt
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hazelnut
also
in
the
nose
the
roasted
flavors
and
the
lactic
sweetness
in
the
palate
are
bold
and
pronounced
tasty
but
might
benefit
from
more
subtle
flavors
and
greater
complexity
light
carbonation
with
a
thinner
mouthfeel
than
most
milk
stouts
decent
beer
overall
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
if
i
got
a
six
pack
for
say
8
00
it
would
not
be
something
i
would
avoid
a
decent
offering
dpretty
tasty
and
another
low
abv
yet
flavorful
from
butternuts
very
nice
i
poured
this
cool
looking
can
of
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
opaque
beer
with
a
nice
brown
head
the
beer
had
a
thick
coffee
smell
the
beer
tasted
like
it
had
burnt
malt
in
it
and
the
mouthfeel
was
chewy
the
beer
tasted
like
a
milk
stout
with
a
hint
of
smoke
in
it
i
like
and
will
buy
again
very
decent
stout
quite
surprised
by
this
not
a
fan
of
butternuts
so
far
give
it
a
shot
great
value
for
sure
overall
it
is
fairly
unique
compared
to
other
stouts
id
say
if
youre
curious
enough
to
read
a
review
its
worth
trying
this
beer
its
good
and
i
might
consider
buying
it
again
but
its
not
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
i
prefer
imperial
stouts
but
this
is
better
to
session
with
it
was
a
tasty
brew
and
i
dont
mean
to
offend
the
brewers
but
it
is
easily
forgettable
however
i
am
curious
about
some
other
beers
this
company
offers
craft
brew
in
a
can
is
something
im
becoming
strangely
fond
of
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
would
hunt
down
regularly
solid
not
must
have
od
maybe
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
around
a
campfire
but
thats
about
it
lacking
a
robust
flavor
and
fuller
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
under
appealing
o
i
never
tried
anything
from
butternuts
because
i
think
their
graphics
are
cheesy
my
mistake
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
bargain
to
boot
od
it
has
some
off
flavors
and
unfortunately
they
are
up
front
once
over
that
hurdle
the
positives
give
way
a
decent
cocoa
powder
flavor
is
introduced
but
cant
tell
if
its
fake
or
natural
overall
not
the
greatest
stout
in
the
world
not
even
the
best
canned
stout
tenfidy
but
for
a
dark
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
sure
kicks
the
crap
out
of
guinness
this
was
the
last
can
from
a
mixed
12
pack
that
i
picked
up
and
is
definitely
the
best
one
of
the
bunch
nice
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
some
more
of
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
and
relatively
lightbodied
nature
make
it
a
very
sessionable
stout
o
quite
a
good
stout
really
nothing
that
knocks
you
over
the
head
but
the
flavors
are
all
there
and
quite
well
balanced
a
very
drinkable
yet
distinct
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
the
cpj
overall
pretty
good
milk
stout
not
sure
if
i
would
get
again
but
nonetheless
it
was
good
to
try
reminds
me
of
my
first
guinness
sans
the
nitro
solid
and
worth
a
try
a
very
tasty
beer
that
went
down
smooth
and
easy
the
flavor
had
a
lot
more
depth
than
i
expected
especially
from
a
can
and
while
this
might
have
been
on
the
thin
side
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
and
i
doubt
there
are
many
from
a
can
that
could
be
said
to
be
much
better
the
beer
boasts
good
flavors
and
in
decent
quantities
one
of
the
only
faults
is
a
faint
metallic
bite
around
the
edges
though
im
not
sure
if
thats
due
to
the
can
or
something
related
to
the
brewing
process
either
way
this
is
a
stout
worth
trying
final
thoughts
its
decent
it
would
be
the
perfect
stout
for
a
first
timer
big
malts
light
hops
light
body
smoky
a
good
start
point
and
your
not
starting
them
on
the
best
so
theres
plenty
of
room
to
show
them
the
better
just
hope
the
turning
milk
smell
does
turn
them
off
bought
this
beer
because
i
needed
decent
craft
beer
that
came
in
a
can
for
an
afternoon
at
a
private
lake
the
beer
didnt
disappoint
me
its
a
thick
black
color
frothy
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
grain
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
nice
aroma
the
flavor
is
balanced
but
maybe
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
full
in
body
this
is
a
nice
beer
o
ok
pretty
good
as
go
the
3
i
have
sampled
this
is
the
best
and
might
not
still
order
another
a
bit
small
on
taste
as
far
as
the
style
goes
there
are
a
few
really
great
ones
out
there
and
this
is
a
bit
over
average
for
me
d
not
the
greatest
beer
overall
but
i
could
certainly
take
this
one
down
like
a
lager
overall
o
k
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
pretty
forgettable
this
is
a
good
stout
particularly
if
one
is
looking
for
a
lighter
more
drinkable
stout
rather
than
a
monster
update
the
very
unpleasant
sour
milk
experience
may
have
been
an
aberration
i
recently
tried
a
different
beer
at
a
restaurant
and
got
a
similar
taste
but
i
tried
another
beer
from
the
pack
and
it
tasted
much
better
i
will
rereview
this
someday
and
hopefully
get
a
better
result
burnt
black
patent
malt
flavor
relatively
thin
for
the
style
nice
stronger
hop
finish
that
makes
this
notably
different
from
most
stouts
a
fairly
average
stout
not
bad
if
looking
for
a
budget
stout
except
this
isnt
cheap
enough
to
be
considered
budget
in
my
books
cute
label
though
overall
i
like
this
brew
as
its
a
nice
combonation
of
stout
flavors
for
a
milk
stout
the
earthier
flavors
mix
well
with
the
lactose
overall
not
really
impressed
by
this
stout
flavors
are
average
at
best
there
is
certainly
no
wow
factor
to
this
stout
at
all
the
aroma
lied
to
me
making
me
believe
this
was
going
to
be
a
tasty
brew
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
into
average
stouts
nice
feel
on
this
one
creamy
feel
with
a
full
body
overall
this
one
impressed
me
quite
a
bit
a
very
well
done
stout
and
a
fun
canned
offering
pours
black
and
brown
edges
light
tan
frothy
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
aromas
are
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
follow
but
theres
a
tinge
of
an
oldish
earthy
characteristic
that
comes
and
goes
medium
mouthfeel
and
no
complaints
about
the
carbonation
can
easily
put
a
few
of
these
down
and
will
definitely
go
back
for
more
pours
a
deep
brown
black
with
no
head
and
reasonable
lacing
aroma
is
light
some
coffee
beans
earthy
some
light
chocolate
and
slightly
earthly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
of
coffee
beans
some
hops
a
hint
of
slices
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
some
sort
of
burnt
taste
i
cant
identify
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
from
a
mixed
twelve
pack
of
cans
odecent
example
of
a
milk
stout
very
drinkable
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
row
the
flavor
is
simple
but
not
boring
or
one
dimensional
deep
dark
brown
light
shines
through
on
edges
disapointing
lack
of
head
scent
is
of
dark
roasted
and
charred
malts
with
lactose
comming
though
in
the
end
first
sip
is
heavily
roasted
and
charred
faint
thoughts
of
dark
cocoa
powder
lactose
is
very
subdued
lacks
the
sweetness
expected
from
a
milk
stout
towards
the
end
of
the
can
the
char
is
the
dominant
note
and
obliterates
the
palate
medium
bodied
watery
at
times
lacks
creamynes
from
style
long
lingering
char
notes
not
a
great
milk
stout
due
to
the
overwhelming
char
and
lack
of
lactose
sweetness
and
weak
body
o
i
liked
this
one
i
wouldnt
rank
it
up
their
with
surly
four
moloko
or
anything
like
that
but
it
did
the
job
good
stuff
notes
for
what
this
is
its
very
nice
will
buy
again
when
i
want
to
drink
multiples
in
a
night
or
in
the
mood
for
something
roasty
and
light
d
this
was
a
very
simple
stout
but
it
was
clean
and
enjoyable
not
much
to
it
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
but
not
easy
to
remember
drinking
was
expecting
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
not
as
dry
from
a
milk
stout
d
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
and
goes
down
very
smooth
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
body
but
is
really
smooth
and
light
and
not
empty
as
it
is
drinkability
is
well
good
this
would
make
a
good
summer
stout
for
me
favorable
with
out
being
big
and
heavy
which
can
be
a
bad
thing
out
in
the
middle
of
summer
when
u
looking
for
something
to
quench
our
thirst
this
is
an
acceptable
stout
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
is
enjoyable
if
you
are
curious
you
may
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
overall
i
can
see
what
butternuts
wanted
to
accomplish
with
this
stout
but
i
think
they
might
have
gone
too
overboard
with
the
hops
the
beer
was
not
too
bad
but
i
think
there
better
uses
of
time
my
biggest
complaint
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
way
too
watery
however
i
do
love
the
container
and
there
are
sure
to
be
times
i
would
drink
this
right
out
the
can
so
maybe
that
would
be
less
noticeable
low
abv
makes
this
a
decent
option
if
youre
looking
for
a
nonlager
kickball
beer
notes
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
dont
really
know
why
its
just
a
great
beverage
to
drink
it
may
not
seem
like
much
but
for
whatever
reason
it
goes
down
really
easily
and
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
taste
is
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
smell
some
light
roast
coffe
in
there
maybe
burnt
chocolate
but
it
leaves
a
stale
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
which
is
slightly
offputting
mouthfeel
is
definitely
watery
and
takes
away
from
the
experience
i
expected
a
creamier
and
heavier
feel
its
not
terrible
by
any
stretch
but
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
ill
try
their
others
though
for
sure
o
an
average
stout
with
a
below
average
mf
what
saves
this
beer
is
being
in
a
mixed
12
pack
o
decent
overall
but
forgettable
i
love
this
style
and
i
have
had
much
better
but
i
have
also
had
worse
i
would
be
interested
to
try
this
on
a
nitrotap
like
left
hand
or
youngs
double
chocolate
both
of
which
i
had
the
same
night
grab
one
laugh
at
the
can
and
enjoy
a
very
good
session
brew
would
consider
drinking
this
often
at
less
than
5
drinkability
would
be
exceptional
if
not
for
the
body
d
very
drinkable
possibly
too
drinkable
if
there
such
a
thing
personally
i
like
to
feel
like
i
should
be
savoring
my
stouts
while
this
one
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
future
outlook
nothing
about
this
beer
jumps
up
and
grabs
you
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
solid
easy
drinking
stout
as
beer
that
doesnt
come
here
not
one
to
seek
out
but
certainly
not
one
to
avoid
if
you
happen
upon
it
d
quite
drinkable
actually
very
tasty
its
nice
to
find
another
canned
beer
better
packing
in
the
fridge
thats
pretty
tasty
i
am
loving
the
new
can
craze
and
especially
the
stouts
i
would
love
to
take
some
of
these
on
a
cold
hiking
trip
that
is
if
ten
fidy
isnt
available
d
definitely
the
strong
point
for
this
brew
low
abv
with
a
good
amount
of
taste
a
jet
black
fluid
with
a
brown
head
good
retention
and
a
moderate
fade
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
of
coffee
and
dark
roasted
grains
sweet
caramel
and
light
molasses
taste
is
like
a
great
cup
of
coffee
touch
of
mocha
a
bit
of
sweet
lactic
sourness
dry
earthy
finish
with
dark
roastyness
feel
is
light
with
a
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
good
one
for
winter
or
summer
simple
and
very
well
done
i
will
be
keeping
this
one
around
the
house
great
beer
here
nothing
too
flashy
but
a
pretty
decent
stout
with
some
mild
but
pleasant
flavor
as
long
as
the
price
was
within
reason
id
purchase
this
again
taste
is
a
milky
smooth
darker
malt
with
very
light
hop
throughout
moderate
carbonation
very
evenly
balanced
and
quite
tasty
blackdeep
brown
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
persists
throughout
aroma
is
of
chocolate
dry
roasted
malt
some
wood
notes
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
a
chocolate
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
an
earthy
roast
character
getting
some
chocolate
milkshake
and
caramel
flavor
as
well
creamy
smooth
body
with
a
clean
toasty
finish
very
drinkable
very
well
priced
average
drinkability
notes
quiet
brew
but
quite
recommendable
nothing
extraordinary
but
it
is
a
notch
well
above
average
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
but
not
watery
the
carbonation
levels
are
on
the
lower
side
but
work
out
well
this
is
a
very
nice
comforting
milk
stout
no
gimmicks
involved
just
straight
up
well
made
beer
moo
thunder
brings
the
thunder
to
your
glass
a
wee
bit
watered
down
and
a
little
sourness
to
the
finish
which
is
a
little
unpleasant
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
and
a
novelty
out
of
a
can
pitch
black
with
thick
creamy
light
brown
head
and
great
head
retention
and
lacing
rich
roasty
malt
aroma
with
plenty
of
chocolate
sweet
smelling
more
chocolate
flavor
less
roasty
but
still
some
coffee
and
burnt
malts
there
thin
tasting
though
with
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
pours
deep
black
two
finger
cream
head
pretty
standard
stout
aroma
immediate
roasted
notes
flavor
is
deep
chocolate
and
bright
not
quite
sure
how
to
really
describe
it
graham
cracker
notes
as
it
opens
up
some
almost
savory
notes
appear
as
well
finishes
very
clean
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
if
this
was
regular
offering
around
me
i
would
buy
it
from
time
to
time
pours
black
with
a
lasting
thick
brown
head
and
nice
lasting
aroma
of
bready
roasted
malt
dry
fruit
and
some
coffee
body
is
light
for
a
stout
high
carbonation
flavors
are
light
coffee
vanila
dry
fruit
and
roasted
malt
short
bitter
finish
somewhat
light
for
a
stout
but
not
bad
for
the
price
goes
down
easy
and
is
an
easy
session
beer
for
the
price
but
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
coming
back
is
the
fact
that
its
local
nothing
too
special
d
a
nice
canned
stout
thats
lighter
in
abv
would
love
to
try
this
super
fresh
drinkability
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
terms
of
a
milk
stout
from
this
brewery
the
sour
astringent
taste
and
dry
finish
were
more
prominent
than
what
i
would
have
liked
i
probably
will
not
be
revisiting
this
one
in
the
near
future
i
love
this
stout
for
the
taste
perfect
with
a
nice
porter
house
on
the
grill
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
has
a
bit
of
staying
power
the
nose
brings
forward
some
roasted
malt
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
as
well
mouthfeel
is
of
a
medium
body
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
all
around
nothing
too
bad
here
which
i
was
quite
fearful
of
12oz
can
pours
a
deep
brown
color
any
head
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
slight
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malts
sweet
smell
i
taste
some
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
the
malt
flavors
somewhat
of
a
thin
stout
drinkable
and
tasty
damn
decent
milk
stout
wouldnt
mind
a
few
of
em
allinall
a
pretty
simple
and
tasty
stout
nothing
to
complain
about
but
nothing
really
to
rave
about
either
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
a
very
nice
aroma
the
flavor
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
i
get
some
roasted
malt
and
toffee
but
i
also
get
something
that
resembles
earthdirt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
nothing
too
special
but
worth
a
taste
and
another
purchase
deep
black
in
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
after
the
pour
that
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
no
cap
or
lacings
roasted
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
smooth
and
creamy
feel
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
which
made
it
less
filling
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
beginning
with
a
touch
of
milky
sweetness
that
tapers
to
a
pleasant
toasty
malt
character
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
beer
people
beer
that
reminds
us
that
sometimes
simple
can
be
best
and
its
marketing
reminds
us
that
beer
is
and
always
has
been
fun
flavorful
extremely
drinkable
and
fun
nice
to
see
a
milk
stout
in
a
can
moo
thunder
with
this
crazy
cartoon
cow
okay
ill
drink
it
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
nice
mocha
tan
head
forms
nicely
with
lacing
strung
evenly
between
sips
body
is
dark
nearly
black
light
toffee
brown
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
just
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
aromatics
offer
up
dark
roasted
malt
with
creamy
lactose
sweetness
hints
of
anise
a
touch
of
meaty
soy
sauce
with
herbal
hops
in
the
background
flavor
has
a
rounded
creamy
sweetness
with
dark
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
from
the
nearly
burnt
malted
barley
additions
herbal
hops
underlying
a
nice
session
milk
stout
out
of
the
can
what
complexty
and
nice
flavors
from
a
canned
stout
this
is
excellent
soft
even
carbonation
creates
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
again
i
was
scared
to
try
these
beers
base
off
of
sidts
nightmare
tasting
show
they
had
but
im
glad
i
gave
these
guys
a
fair
shake
im
wondering
if
theyre
case
was
out
of
date
or
not
drinkability
again
great
stuff
sessionable
and
packed
with
flavor
what
every
beer
drinker
out
there
is
looking
for
d
a
decent
brew
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
it
is
not
a
bad
stout
and
doesnt
take
up
that
much
room
in
your
belly
this
beer
is
also
not
a
palatecleanser
with
its
mild
flavor
and
feel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
though
recommended
from
the
12
fl
oz
can
with
no
lot
code
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
august
28
2010
the
pour
is
a
rich
black
with
a
quick
one
inche
tan
head
that
dissolves
down
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
lacing
is
shortlived
too
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
dark
chocolate
modest
malts
and
milk
the
taste
has
a
fullbodied
chocolate
bitterness
with
a
sharp
hoppy
bite
toward
the
finale
a
stout
from
a
can
what
do
you
know
d
great
drinkability
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
at
all
this
could
be
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
drinkability
got
this
is
a
mixed
12
predominantly
because
i
wanted
to
get
some
pork
slap
pale
ale
for
a
friend
who
says
beer
geeks
are
not
subject
to
marketing
a
robust
and
flavorful
carry
me
through
all
the
reading
i
need
to
do
for
the
start
of
school
tomorrow
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
some
might
call
it
boring
but
im
really
starting
to
appreciate
subtle
restrained
beers
like
this
its
far
from
perfect
but
if
youre
in
need
of
some
dark
roasted
flavor
in
a
sessionlike
beer
this
one
fits
the
bill
bonus
points
for
beer
in
a
can
not
to
mention
the
fun
artwork
on
the
label
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
near
two
finger
head
of
light
sand
head
into
a
snifter
as
the
head
receeds
it
leaves
layers
of
lacing
really
nice
looking
and
its
opaque
enough
to
block
out
the
sun
smell
has
smoke
stale
cinnamon
dare
i
say
whole
milk
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
are
present
as
well
taste
has
sweet
malt
and
bittersweetbakers
chocolate
up
front
coffee
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
back
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
viscous
but
has
a
thinness
to
it
that
could
be
made
up
for
on
tap
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
gorgeous
looking
brew
in
the
glass
opaque
black
with
a
huge
dark
mocha
colored
head
having
massive
longevity
the
nose
is
mmmooooooo
like
smoked
fresh
heavy
cream
mixed
with
just
ground
fresh
espresso
beans
smoked
over
beechwood
simply
fabulous
the
taste
is
akin
to
the
nose
dark
heavily
french
or
italian
roasted
beans
with
some
dark
chocolate
nibs
thrown
in
for
good
measure
very
malty
and
milk
like
in
flavor
its
an
oddity
that
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
quite
lithe
thin
in
the
mouth
with
little
body
the
mouthfeel
is
totally
out
of
synchronous
with
the
rest
of
the
factors
this
is
unusual
statistically
speaking
one
would
expect
some
additional
creaminess
and
weight
in
a
brew
as
well
endowed
as
this
and
i
must
say
it
was
obvious
when
i
poured
it
from
the
can
that
this
would
be
the
case
although
a
fairly
negligible
demerit
this
is
nevertheless
a
well
made
and
enjoyable
milk
stout
that
has
a
bit
of
a
bamberg
brewing
influence
this
my
friends
is
one
way
to
get
your
vitamin
d
dyou
can
pound
these
a
nice
diversion
in
the
hot
weather
bravo
to
these
guys
for
making
a
sessionable
stout
very
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
because
of
its
light
feel
and
taste
on
my
list
for
future
purchases
when
my
batch
of
cream
stout
gives
out
d
very
good
but
i
might
want
to
quit
the
sweetness
after
a
couple
drinkability
decent
surprise
other
than
the
mouthfeel
this
was
a
solid
beer
i
would
probably
have
again
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
this
milk
stout
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
lactose
chocolate
and
cocoa
this
brew
is
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
and
pretty
light
for
the
style
the
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
as
well
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
had
some
nice
roasty
and
bitter
flavor
to
it
and
was
pretty
smooth
overall
the
aroma
is
thick
with
roasted
malt
and
a
sweetness
of
brown
sugar
there
is
also
a
faint
antisepticbandaid
like
aroma
the
flavor
is
almost
entirely
roasted
malts
slightly
sweetened
fairly
smooth
low
but
present
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
moderate
still
id
say
its
fairly
drinkable
d
really
shines
here
a
nice
beer
from
a
cool
company
with
a
great
image
nice
designs
cans
and
overall
just
breaking
for
the
norm
seem
to
be
getting
me
picking
up
certain
beers
more
and
more
i
would
definitely
grab
a
6er
of
this
one
after
the
single
can
trial
run
butternuts
moo
thunder
is
a
pitch
black
beer
with
a
dense
light
brown
head
that
thins
a
bit
and
leaves
thick
sheets
of
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
smells
like
a
jamocha
shake
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
it
leaves
the
tongue
a
little
chalky
and
numb
its
a
tad
watery
its
lightly
flavored
and
just
a
touch
sweet
it
never
becomes
cloying
it
tastes
roasty
more
like
coffee
than
chocolate
not
dark
roast
coffee
a
note
of
caramel
is
detected
theres
no
bitterness
really
this
is
a
simple
and
easy
to
drink
beer
its
definitely
the
best
ive
had
from
butternuts
pours
a
nice
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
beige
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
like
a
fine
roast
coffee
rather
smoky
and
inviting
flavor
is
like
a
cold
mocha
with
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
tones
and
just
a
hint
of
molasses
texture
is
smooth
just
a
little
tingly
and
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
this
is
the
beers
weakest
aspect
all
in
all
a
decent
stout
not
the
best
but
still
palatable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
stout
with
enough
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sessionable
stout
710
poured
a
darkishbrown
almost
black
body
with
some
offwhite
head
that
disipates
slowly
a
good
roasted
and
sweet
malt
presence
but
some
aluminum
funk
as
well
smooth
creamy
light
on
the
malts
but
still
has
a
dark
cocoaroasted
malt
taste
alonf
with
some
caramel
and
coffee
for
an
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
with
a
dry
finish
nothing
exceptional
but
for
the
cost
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
only
bc
of
the
cost
basically
this
is
a
milk
chocolate
beer
and
i
prefer
dark
chocolate
theres
a
bit
of
coffee
in
there
and
there
is
basically
a
whole
lot
of
malt
lacks
a
bit
of
the
balance
i
would
have
wanted
sweetness
or
bitterness
a
little
lighter
body
then
i
would
have
expected
and
this
beer
is
incredibly
dry
which
hinders
its
drinkability
in
my
book
overall
its
alright
but
not
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
d
if
the
acid
taste
doesnt
bother
you
i
can
see
this
being
very
easy
to
pound
very
smooth
and
creamy
pretty
dark
in
colornot
quite
a
solid
black
small
tight
tan
head
moderate
amount
of
roasted
aromatouch
of
sweetness
as
well
really
nice
roastedgrainy
flavor
good
level
of
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
lot
of
flavor
here
good
body
as
well
very
very
drinkable
easy
going
downi
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
for
me
d
i
would
be
happy
to
see
this
at
a
party
i
would
also
buy
one
or
two
at
the
bar
however
it
is
not
tasty
enough
to
be
an
all
night
drink
the
moo
thunder
stout
pours
a
deep
cola
brown
with
a
1
5
finger
tan
head
that
bubbles
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
in
on
the
glass
aromas
consist
of
burnt
coffee
with
a
musky
aged
smell
that
lingers
no
malts
are
noticed
not
the
best
smelling
taste
is
somewhat
watery
with
coffee
dominating
the
flavors
not
much
comes
through
on
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
and
creamy
drinkability
is
meh
easy
drinker
but
not
much
to
the
nose
or
the
palate
may
skip
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
stout
that
took
me
by
surprise
nothing
flashy
or
fancy
but
fairly
well
done
ill
definitely
have
another
d
a
decent
representation
of
style
not
a
fabulous
beer
but
a
highly
drinkable
beer
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
the
body
was
not
quite
so
watery
save
for
the
finish
decent
beer
especially
one
from
a
can
tried
this
at
a
new
spot
near
my
apartment
called
the
passenger
it
was
pretty
good
hard
to
tell
though
because
of
the
can
for
a
lot
of
it
i
kept
tasting
the
can
the
smell
was
of
aluminium
surprise
and
toffee
and
chocolate
taste
was
less
bitter
than
i
had
expected
a
nice
stout
to
finish
off
the
night
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
but
in
a
glass
next
time
d
this
wasnt
as
good
as
an
experience
as
i
had
hoped
for
the
first
time
i
drank
this
beer
was
on
the
day
i
bought
it
straight
from
the
can
and
it
was
good
the
can
i
just
reviewed
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
i
dont
know
if
thats
going
to
affect
it
though
brewery
lists
lactose
sugar
as
brewing
ingredient
so
this
might
be
better
considered
a
milk
or
sweet
stout
the
dancing
cow
and
name
suggest
the
same
pours
a
deep
black
nice
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
with
well
balanced
bittering
wheels
sort
of
come
off
the
bus
at
the
finish
however
with
a
rather
sharp
acidic
sourness
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
also
mild
again
malts
with
some
chocolate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
but
unspectacular
beer
average
stout
which
has
a
pretty
looking
cow
on
the
front
of
the
can
overall
i
would
not
waste
my
money
buying
this
beer
single
from
ye
olde
spirit
shop
frederick
md
d
one
would
suffice
an
excellent
tasting
beer
with
a
lot
to
offer
fills
up
fast
though
my
first
experience
with
a
canned
stout
turned
out
to
be
very
pleasant
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
6
pack
at
my
local
store
of
choice
once
again
andover
liquors
this
is
a
very
good
stout
if
you
want
a
session
beer
it
pours
a
very
typical
nice
black
stout
color
and
has
not
much
head
with
a
little
spotted
lacing
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
a
nice
malty
chocolatey
aroma
the
moo
thunder
has
a
creamy
chocolatey
taste
and
i
would
recommend
it
probably
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
a
can
along
with
a
creative
name
the
design
on
the
can
is
also
quite
eye
catching
i
definitely
will
drink
this
again
pours
a
straight
jet
black
with
a
light
halo
of
khaki
head
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
matls
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
follows
almost
exactly
though
the
coffee
takes
first
precedence
followed
by
the
malts
and
the
chocolate
comes
in
as
a
side
flavor
in
the
back
nice
lightly
medium
body
makes
for
a
nice
straightforward
highly
drinkable
stout
d
even
though
there
were
some
offflavors
i
still
found
this
enjoyable
nice
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
stout
especially
if
you
going
someplace
that
only
allows
cans
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
this
stout
feels
a
bit
watery
and
thin
but
it
is
no
imperial
so
this
is
acceptable
to
me
carbonation
is
great
with
this
one
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
brews
to
come
from
a
can
overallnice
stout
not
knock
your
shoes
off
good
by
any
means
but
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
drinkable
based
upon
flavor
but
the
smell
is
hard
to
get
past
probably
will
not
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
certainly
a
lighter
stout
almost
what
i
would
call
a
summer
stout
decent
enough
d
a
fine
brew
and
a
fairly
good
stout
i
am
really
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
thanks
to
ericwo
for
sending
this
extra
off
of
my
wants
list
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
faded
out
pretty
quickly
i
saw
that
someone
had
described
the
beer
as
having
a
cigarette
butt
smell
and
now
its
all
i
can
smell
its
also
all
i
can
really
taste
cigarettes
and
booze
some
roasted
malts
not
much
more
going
on
here
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
light
body
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
thin
for
me
but
over
all
it
passes
speaking
of
mocha
yum
this
was
somewhere
around
5055
degrees
when
i
popped
it
open
and
it
tasted
like
drinking
a
cool
cup
of
carbonated
mocha
absolutely
delicious
i
had
another
one
that
was
colder
later
in
the
day
and
there
was
a
lot
less
coffee
to
it
so
depending
on
whether
you
like
a
good
cup
of
joe
or
not
just
drink
this
one
at
the
right
temperature
and
youll
get
what
you
want
drinkability
low
mouthfeel
fair
not
a
repeat
for
me
into
a
guinness
glass
poured
nearblack
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
laced
fairly
well
the
smell
was
of
cocoa
powder
toffee
nuttiness
and
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
revealed
a
very
nice
blend
of
chocolatecovered
nuts
from
the
getgo
dissolving
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
creamy
which
added
to
the
flavor
sensation
but
did
end
on
a
slightly
thin
note
definitely
a
good
session
stout
this
is
a
fine
stout
in
can
yes
thats
stout
in
a
can
thats
fun
to
say
d
great
sessionable
stout
probabaly
wont
go
seeking
it
out
but
i
would
deffinately
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
solid
offering
here
nothing
crazy
but
very
good
for
a
stout
in
a
can
for
sure
the
plus
side
is
that
with
its
easy
drinking
taste
and
its
low
abv
4
90
this
would
be
a
great
session
stout
very
drinkable
indeed
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
mocha
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
layer
throughout
the
session
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
and
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
this
one
is
in
my
opinion
the
perfect
example
of
a
simple
american
stout
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
thick
or
cloying
and
i
sucked
it
down
way
too
fast
these
showed
up
in
pa
recently
so
i
will
definitely
be
stocking
up
on
these
overall
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
stout
but
more
body
and
deeper
flavors
would
help
it
out
immensely
i
let
the
artwork
get
the
best
of
me
here
this
one
is
so
bad
i
dont
think
ill
ever
try
another
from
this
brewery
let
me
know
if
im
wrong
tastes
like
a
weak
watered
down
oatmeal
stout
pour
and
head
are
unimpressive
why
bother
mass
producing
this
if
it
was
a
home
brew
i
would
say
keep
trying
buddy
but
they
brewed
this
in
a
brewery
bah
always
happy
to
try
a
craft
beer
in
a
can
and
this
one
also
lists
some
nutritional
info
makes
me
wonder
what
effect
that
would
have
on
the
consumption
of
big
huge
beers
but
i
digress
opaque
notquiteblack
weak
head
that
faded
to
some
shadowing
on
the
surface
smells
like
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
oily
coconut
the
flavor
resembles
the
aroma
closely
especially
up
front
but
then
the
taste
just
kinda
drops
off
some
bitterness
sneaks
back
as
it
warms
some
fruitiness
comes
in
to
add
a
little
something
but
its
still
not
quite
enough
to
make
this
something
id
reach
for
again
not
horrible
but
not
so
exciting
i
might
only
think
about
this
one
again
if
someone
is
specifically
looking
for
a
nonimperial
stout
in
a
can
d
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
it
is
just
not
good
enough
to
really
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
final
thoughts
its
a
pretty
basic
thick
milkoatmeall
stout
not
bad
nonetheless
i
was
surprised
how
nice
it
ended
up
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
this
can
is
also
about
a
year
old
so
i
wonder
if
that
changed
the
beer
drinkability
one
to
skip
alright
so
butternuts
thinking
outside
the
brew
box
aimed
for
a
notsostout
milk
stout
so
look
for
a
beer
thats
washed
out
and
watered
down
in
terms
of
taste
and
peppered
with
a
few
offflavors
this
one
is
easy
to
consume
and
interesting
enough
to
handle
a
discussion
12oz
can
purchased
at
the
liquor
shoppe
in
tygsboro
ma
pours
a
pitch
black
opaque
body
with
an
inch
of
khaki
head
smells
nutty
burnt
some
smoky
tobacco
all
i
taste
is
smoky
tobacco
too
bunt
planty
moderate
in
both
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
astringency
hurts
the
drinkability
greatly
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
d
this
beer
goes
down
well
and
its
a
decent
stout
but
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
definitely
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
pours
very
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smells
slightly
roasty
and
quite
grainy
with
a
somewhat
thin
grainy
sourness
that
intrudes
a
bit
into
the
more
pleasant
top
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
could
have
a
bit
more
body
and
if
this
were
shifted
a
bit
more
eithwr
to
the
dry
side
with
more
body
or
as
is
to
the
sweet
side
perhaps
with
some
added
lactic
sugars
then
this
would
hit
the
mark
a
bit
closer
as
is
its
drinkable
but
fairly
forgettable
drinkability
this
is
a
surprisingly
sessionable
stout
i
like
the
nutty
taste
i
could
have
several
of
these
especially
around
a
campfire
d
modest
abv
and
nice
mellow
roasted
malt
flavors
allow
this
stout
to
be
a
nice
afterdinner
brew
or
latenight
sipper
with
summer
rapidly
approaching
find
a
little
space
for
this
stout
in
your
cooler
or
camper
very
simple
but
well
done
stout
in
a
can
no
complaints
very
rich
roasty
and
toasty
great
stuff
for
a
fall
camping
trip
or
a
cool
summer
night
the
brew
is
lightbodied
with
plenty
of
extremelyfine
carbonation
were
it
not
for
the
stout
word
on
the
label
id
be
convinced
i
just
had
a
nice
mild
quaffable
belgian
ale
did
i
who
cares
at
any
rate
moo
thunder
is
a
tasty
interesting
beer
that
comes
in
amusinglooking
cans
and
i
could
drink
a
few
at
a
sitting
for
sure
thanks
for
the
canstas
lumsta
after
dinner
at
a
local
restaurant
i
ordered
one
of
these
5
and
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
combo
poured
into
a
tall
juice
glass
dark
black
color
surprised
to
see
really
no
head
form
no
lacing
either
not
much
smell
to
report
and
the
taste
was
sub
par
it
had
a
somewhat
roasted
barley
flavor
with
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
only
problem
was
that
it
seemed
very
watered
down
both
the
flavor
and
the
body
were
extremely
thin
not
what
i
expected
or
hoped
for
i
guess
you
could
say
it
was
easy
to
drink
because
it
was
so
mild
and
watery
but
i
would
not
call
this
a
great
example
of
a
craft
stout
though
it
did
leave
me
curious
as
to
what
their
other
beers
taste
like
in
these
funny
looking
cans
poured
from
a
12
ounce
can
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
stout
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
lingering
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
grain
both
bittersweet
and
milk
chocolates
bitter
grassy
hops
a
bit
thin
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
worth
a
try
definitely
worth
a
try
i
may
have
this
again
d
not
bad
this
would
be
a
very
good
golf
course
beer
the
people
i
shared
this
beer
with
did
not
like
the
sweetness
but
to
me
it
was
no
different
than
having
a
soda
to
knockout
a
thirst
not
that
i
am
comparing
this
beer
to
a
sodajust
it
delivery
in
the
heat
sure
goes
down
easily
as
its
not
heavy
of
texture
has
an
undemanding
flavor
and
is
lightbodied
for
the
style
nothing
offensive
about
it
either
hey
the
can
design
totally
suckered
me
in
i
admit
it
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
canned
beer
would
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
easy
drinking
beer
funny
name
for
a
beer
too
all
in
all
a
reliable
and
tasty
stout
d
hmm
this
was
surprising
with
the
lactose
addition
i
expected
a
smoother
sweeter
stout
what
i
got
was
more
roasted
and
bitter
with
a
touch
of
souring
still
its
good
enough
to
have
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
and
somehow
found
a
can
in
oregon
or
travels
took
me
to
ny
thanks
john
pours
out
black
with
a
lot
of
dark
ruby
colors
coming
through
where
light
passes
it
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lace
and
actually
has
hood
retention
the
aroma
is
very
mild
and
of
dark
roasted
malt
nothing
burnt
or
charred
the
flavor
is
nothing
special
its
not
bad
but
its
just
a
normal
stout
in
fact
i
think
this
is
the
best
butternuts
beer
ive
had
i
give
them
a
lot
of
cred
for
canning
their
beers
great
move
d
i
could
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
but
not
sure
if
id
want
to
have
much
more
than
2
not
my
favorite
stout
but
still
fairly
impressive
definitely
went
a
long
way
to
dispell
the
myth
of
no
good
beer
comes
in
a
can
mouth
feel
is
thick
fullbodied
and
a
joy
to
drink
really
god
brew
here
must
try
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
a
lightly
medium
body
that
is
creamy
and
flat
the
finish
is
light
and
quick
i
must
admit
the
name
on
the
can
had
me
laughing
but
the
beer
in
the
can
doesnt
have
me
laughing
the
beer
is
rather
uninteresting
flat
and
the
burnt
character
is
a
little
overwhelming
it
is
just
okay
not
bad
especially
compared
to
a
couple
other
offerings
from
butternuts
and
i
actually
finished
the
can
i
just
wish
that
the
overall
flavor
had
given
up
some
more
drinkability
this
is
on
the
same
plane
as
those
big
3
from
ireland
ok
this
is
not
what
i
remember
i
remember
a
beer
that
was
thin
but
flavorful
read
above
this
is
just
a
thin
watery
mess
smells
strange
like
the
inside
of
a
rubber
boot
and
is
virtually
tasteless
what
flavor
can
be
detected
has
an
off
quality
maybe
they
add
ginger
to
this
one
too
like
they
do
with
the
pale
ale
not
sure
and
dont
care
wont
be
buying
it
again
its
good
butternuts
comes
out
and
says
that
this
isnt
meant
to
be
heavy
or
viscous
it
might
otherwise
have
been
confusing
with
thunder
in
the
name
im
sure
there
are
people
who
would
prefer
a
stout
this
light
bodied
im
simply
not
one
of
them
i
didnt
dislike
moo
thunder
i
enjoyed
it
an
average
amount
which
seems
about
right
considering
its
an
average
stout
silky
dark
roast
really
comes
through
minimal
coffee
smooth
milky
mouthfeel
a
prefectly
uncomplicated
and
balanced
stout
freindly
and
pleasant
though
a
bit
watery
thanks
john
this
is
another
brew
that
i
probably
never
would
have
traded
for
and
now
i
gotta
try
their
others
galt
loves
a
good
canned
micro
mouthfeel
is
not
as
light
as
a
dry
stout
but
no
where
near
a
milk
stout
creaminess
very
smooth
and
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
guinness
easy
friendly
doesnt
have
to
be
the
center
of
attention
really
a
delight
i
thought
notes
from
3608
note
avoid
at
all
costs
butternuts
website
its
pretty
darn
lame
drinkability
probably
my
favorite
from
the
butternuts
mix
pack
more
carbonation
would
help
this
brew
out
a
lot
but
as
far
a
flavorful
stout
i
could
drink
a
few
of
on
a
cooler
day
this
works
for
me
id
definitely
have
this
once
in
a
while
if
it
was
local
solid
beer

poured
into
straight
pint
glass
poured
with
almost
no
head
im
not
a
fan
of
a
lot
of
head
but
even
splashing
this
from
the
can
into
the
glass
brought
an
absolutely
minimal
head
aroma
was
very
nice
had
that
roasty
smell
that
good
stouts
and
porters
have
flavor
followed
the
expectations
that
the
aroma
set
nice
body
although
slightly
thin
for
the
style
very
drinkable
of
the
4
styles
that
came
in
a
sampler
pack
i
found
this
to
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
this
stout
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
weird
flavor
the
other
3
styles
had
i
would
certainly
drink
this
more
regularly
if
it
was
locally
available
d
this
brew
has
some
things
going
for
it
and
then
some
things
holding
it
back
it
is
a
very
easily
drinkable
brew
just
a
good
taste
and
good
look
but
the
feel
and
nose
is
lacking
still
this
is
not
a
let
down
in
any
way
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thanks
again
larry
drinkability
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
probably
my
favorite
of
the
sampler
fourpack
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
the
alcohol
was
manageable
and
completely
hidden
the
tastes
textbook
enjoyable
and
balanced
give
this
one
a
shot
t
m
d
modest
but
still
flavourful
some
light
chocolatey
flavours
along
with
modest
coffee
and
a
tasty
maltiness
that
is
certainly
accessible
its
on
the
lighter
side
as
is
the
body
though
it
comes
with
a
nice
little
carbonation
kick
to
turn
it
up
a
notch
the
abv
is
presumably
rather
low
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
though
i
havent
searched
too
deep
yet
and
drinkability
seems
hellishly
easy
goes
down
extremely
smooth
this
could
make
for
a
reasonable
session
candidate
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
not
much
sticky
lacing
though
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
toffee
caramel
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
the
dark
stuff
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
recommended
dark
black
in
body
and
a
tan
one
finger
head
the
head
fell
quickly
to
a
transparent
lace
over
the
body
lacing
left

from
the

is
almost
completely
solid

a
little

taste
has
a
strong
smoke
flavor
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
boring
on
this
one
the
most
i
get
are
the
smoked
malts
though
the
carbonation
picks
up
the
more
i
go
through
it
another
guy
in
a
can
that
im
excited
to
try
can
features
a
hilarious
cartoon
cow
dodging
a
black
lightening
bolt
i
gotta
show
this
pack
around
for
the
some
laughs
i
dont
know
why
they
felt
it
necessary
to
print
on
the
side
that
the
beer
contains
150
calories
8
grams
of
carbs
and
1
gram
of
protein
and
0
grams
of
fat
but
it
just
adds
to
the
fun
quirkiness
pours
your
standard
stout
black
with
a
brown
foaming
head
smells
of
dark
chocolate
but
not
much
else
tastes
great
yes
on
the
dark
chocolate
expresso
charred
steak
thick
mouthfeel
but
not
as
dense
as
some
in
its
class
which
i
suppose
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
most
in
its
class
ill
buy
another
pack
and
bring
it
out
with
friends
an
enjoyable
stout
sweetish
turning
dryish
some
complexities
going
on
for
a
lighter
easydrinking
stout
an
okay
stout
it
has
all
the
good
characteristics
but
i
felt
the
flavor
and
aromas
were
a
bit
muted
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
size
sticky
tan
head
a
fair
helping
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
subtle
but
zingy
hop
character
smooth
and
creamy
enough
to
make
this
one
sessionable
stout
for
sure
just
enough
going
on
to
keep
interest
solid
malts
give
off
notes
of
chocolate
and
light
coffee
all
this
is
set
atop
of
a
fresh
fruity
hop
balance
good
semisweet
grainy
finish
as
well
over
all
a
very
nice
beer
d
nice
drinkable
stout
here
nothing
world
class
but
also
nothing
to
complain
about
either
very
sessionable
d
this
is
one
of
the
easier
drinking
stouts
out
there
nothing
remarkable
but
perfect
for
the
camping
trip
where
you
dont
want
to
get
shitfaced
with
ten
fidy
md
a
surprisingly
refreshing
stout
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
in
any
aspect
a
good
introductory
stout
a
rare
sessionable
stout
pours
black
with
a
light
tan
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
mostly
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
noting
that
reaches
out
and
grabs
you
but
a
nice
mix
of
the
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
heavier
on
the
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
its
covered
by
a
slightly
higher
carbonation
this
like
all
the
other
butternuts
beers
is
extremely
drinkable
i
enjoy
the
easy
drinking
simple
brews
from
this
brewery
and
wish
they
were
more
readily
available
around
here
overall
this
is
a
nice
simpler
stout
and
i
will
revisit
i
would
recommend
pours
black
from
the
can
with
a
very
short
tan
head
and
a
very
light
coating
of
lace
roasted
malt
and
strong
bitter
coffee
aromas
taste
is
same
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
good
nice
stout
just
lacking
in
appearance
a
bit
would
buy
again
d
a
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
that
led
to
this
being
a
really
good
stout
definitely
a
very
drinkable
stout
droast
flavour
is
good
at
the
start
but
then
yawn
this
one
is
a
one
trick
pony
the
lack
of
body
hurts
and
the
whole
thing
becomes
boring
and
one
dimensional
as
you
taste
the
same
bitter
roast
over
and
over
and
over
this
beer
has
no
depth
at
all
certainly
the
best
of
the
four
butternuts
beers
but
that
isnt
saying
much
overall
not
an
enjoyable
beer
it
wasnt
toxic
or
anything
but
glad
i
only
bought
one
can
and
not
a
6pack
cant
recommend
this
one
d
average
drinkability
much
better
examples
out
there
limited
in
complexity
and
while
simply
dark
and
rich
it
wont
hold
your
attention
for
long
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
lively
off
color
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
roasted
malt
with
an
almost
soy
saucelike
intensity
the
flavor
however
is
milder
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
character
woody
cherrylike
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
enough
cling
to
emphasize
the
slight
bitter
finish
a
nice
drinkable
stout
though
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
genre
feels
milky
smooth
a
little
bubbly
too
really
nice
feel
to
this
beer
its
a
good
drinkable
stout
mild
sweet
and
pleasant
this
is
a
slick
looking
can
definitely
a
collectible
nothing
beats
a
dancing
cow
this
stout
is
pretty
damn
good
too
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
the
usual
stout
but
i
think
it
still
works
well
plenty
of
flavors
and
carbonated
well
enough
to
make
this
an
easy
drinker
the
best
of
the
butternuts
line
up
i
probably
would
pass
on
this
beer
again
but
i
would
be
interested
to
try
it
off
draft
rather
than
out
of
a
can
recommended
i
bought
this
as
a
tailgating
beer
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
ok
for
that
purpose
but
the
fact
that
i
found
the
other
butternuts
beers
to
be
pretty
solid
makes
this
one
a
big
disappointment
i
wont
revisit
this
again
after
this
6er
is
consumed

caramel

usually

stouts

it
is

why
i
waited
so
long

drink
this

of

the

is

o
this
is

my
favorite
from
the
case
and
probably
more
along
the
lines
of
what
we
expected
love
it
this
is
a
nice
stout
ive
had
many
beers
however
that
taste
exactly
like
this
i
think
coffee
stouts
need
a
big
body
to
stand
up
to
the
coffee
flavor
and
this
isnt
quite
chewy
enough
for
me
i
saved
this
beer
camp
beer
for
last
with
hopes
that
it
would
be
a
proper
goodbye
to
camp
i
am
happy
to
find
that
it
is
i
am
a
sucker
for
beers
that
manage
to
taste
like
dessert
without
tasting
like
they
are
going
to
cause
some
form
of
rapidonset
diabetes
other
than
some
issues
with
the
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
beer
camp
pack
overall
very
good
stout
aromas
of
roasted
malts
dominate
along
with
some
cold
brewed
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
with
some
warming
taste
notes
are
similar
and
finish
with
a
coarse
spice
character
then
a
lingering
roast
coffee
flavor
more
cold
coffee
notes
after
settling
but
a
return
to
rich
roasted
malts
with
some
agitation
overall
better
than
i
feared
that
being
too
much
on
the
coffee
side
of
the
equation
which
is
why
i
hesitated

now

and
was
outstanding
i
did
not
want
it
to
end
if
sierra

or
ninkasi
want
to
produce
this
beer
again
then
i
would
seek
it
out
and
buy
as
much
as
possible
it
was
that
good
best
beer
by
far
in
the
beer
camp
across

series
this
was
everything
i
hoped
for
in
a
milksweet
stout
my
last
beer

across

offering
a
vigorous
pour
yields
a
fingers
worth
of
late
to
develop
medium

modest
retention
the
color
walks
a
fine
line
between
deep
dark

and
flat

in
either
case
a
bit
of
light
leaks
in
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
still
with
no
discernible
carbonation
a
good
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
dominated
by
dark
roast
gourmet
coffee
as
it
should
be
next
in
line
are
whiffs
of
vanilla
there
are
also
some
light
roasted
malt
notes
as
well
the
flavors
that
materialize
on
the
palate
are
a
mirror
image
of
the
aromas
described
above
there
is
a
slight
addition
of
black
licorice
on
the
deep
finish
very
pleasing
on
the
lighter
side
of
full
bodied
chewy
and
viscous
a
light
carbonated
bite
a
rock
star
milk
stout
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
this
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sierra
nevada
lineup
at
least
in
my
humble
opinion
coffee
is
well
balanced
within
the
flavor
profile
kind
of
thin
head
but
mildly
syrupy
mouthfeel
might
be
a
bit
boozy
to
drink
by
itself
but
great
with
a
chipotle
burrito
very
ok
all
these
beer
camp
beers
have
tasted
about
the
same
with
only
minor
changes
from
style
to
style
this
is
ok
but
not
something
i
would
ever
brag
about
lacks
taste
yet
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
strong
coffee
flavor
chocolate
aroma
a
little
chalky
and
winey
at
the
same
time

b
overall
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
a
wonderful
coffee
stout
just
carries
a
smooth
roast
flavor
with
low
bitterness
in
the
bean
all
the
way
and
very
drinkable
and
still
intense
considering
it
is
a
relatively
low
abv
milk
stout
i
loved
trying
this
and
would
drink
it
year
round
overall
a
very
nice
beer
my
last
review
from
the
beer
camp
mixed
pack
i
really
enjoyed
the
experience
and
thought
the
choice
of
styles
and
brewers
was
great
yea
there
were
no
whalesloonz
in
the
box
but
it
was
still
probably
the
best
mixed
pack
ever
made
arguably
the
best
all
around
stout
i
have
had
definitely
recommend
trying
it
if
you
have
the
chance
o
best
of
the
pack
imo
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
pick
up
as
a
6er
but
ill
have
to
enjoy
it
now
i
wish
i
had
opened
it
earlier
to
try
and
get
more
coffee
because
i
just
had
a
fbs
and
having
a
hard
time
picking
a
favorite
fresh
fbs
definitely
has
more
coffee
but
i
think
double
latte
is
thicker
oh
well
they
are
both
great
so
im
a
happy
person
overall
this
is
one
bold
beer
the
aroma
hits
you
like
a
ton
of
bricks
and
the
flavoring
doesnt
disappoint
while
the
feel
is
in
keeping
with
the
style
albeit
a
little
light
it
doesnt
do
the
strength
of
flavoring
enough
justice
you
get
this
intense
chocolatey
coffeed
malty
roast
akin
to
your
big
russian
imperials
for
example
but
this
little
dinky
feel
to
carry
it
the
flavoring
is
so
present
however
that
you
dont
really
spend
that
much
timing
worrying
about
it
beyond
a
simple
critique
this
is
the
best
beer
of
the
bunch
thus
far
with
a
fantastic
representation
of
both
beer
and
coffee
as
was
intended

rocksolid
coffee
stout
it
just
seems
a
bit
too
mild
o
i
was
expecting
a
creamier
feel
and
the
finish
tastefeel
was
just
a
little
off
still
a
great
beer
and
a
great
collaboration
overall
this
is
a
delicious
brew
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
12
pack
to
date
coffee
stouts
can
be
risky
sometimes
bringing
out
the
burnt
and
bitter
notes
while
leaving
the
richness
behind
this
beer
does
no
such
thing
rich
creamy
notes
combined
with
underlying
maltiness
make
it
a
winner
i
had
mine
with
a
steak
meal
and
it
was
well
paired
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
fresh
roast
coffee
aromas
joined
with
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
pour
from
the
bottle
as
the
glass
fills
with
a
deep
dark
black
coffee
colored
brew
topped
with
a
2
latte
hued
cappuccino
creamy
foam
cap
the
foam
cap
blends
beautifully
with
the
beer
below
as
you
drink
softening
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
just
the
right
amount
of
lactose
added
to
keep
it
interesting
a
hint
of
fruit
appears
midpalate
and
then
the
beverage
glides
to
a
drying
slightly
espresso
astringent
finish
with
a
touch
of
tartness
and
lingering
coffee
bitterness
this
is
a
very
creamy
big
bodied
beer
supported
with
a
very
fine
soft
carbonation
that
is
as
close
as
a
beer
will
ever
come
to
a
double
latte
this
beer
needs
to
be
brewed
again
and
in
stores
year
round
awesome
stout
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
seriously
one
of
the
top
5
stouts
ive
had
i
loved
it

into
a

small
snifter

appearing

coffee
finishes
with
toasty

and
a

of

excellent
creamy
mouth
feel
quite
nice
i
saved
this
favorite
of
the
pack
for
the
last
and
it
is
a
worthy
way
to
see
the
finish
of
a
very
ambitious
12
pack
that
i
enjoyed
a
great
deal
overall
this
is
one
of
the
stand
outs
a
well
balanced
and
blended
combination
of
milk
stout
and
coffee
with
a
superb
mouth
feel
on
par
with
barrel
aged
oatmeal
stouts
ninkasi
and
sierra
nevada
did
a
great
job
on
this
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
any
of
ninkasis
stand
alone
stouts
maybe
a
bit
more
than
narwhal
great
beer
and
a
great
series
to
try
its
been
a
great
trip
overall
a
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
this
needs
to
go
into
full
time
production
o
decent
but
has
some
flaws
everything
just
doesnt
come
together
well
enough
to
make
this
outstanding
compares
favorably
against
founders
breakfast
stout
this
is
a
really
great
offering
from
sierra
nevada
that
i
wouldnt
be
mad
about
if
they
decided
to
release
a
beer
with
a
similar
recipe
as
a
yearround
or
even
seasonal
brew
delicious
roasted
coffee
mingles
with
chocolatenotes
barley
and
milk
sugar
to
make
a
highly
satisfying
pick
me
up
very
glad
i
decided
to
go
after
this
one
overall
definitely
evokes
the
flavors
of
a
double
latte
with
its
milky
sweetness
coffee
bitterness
and
smooth
foamy
feel
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
beer
camp
12pack
for
sure
it
pours
black
w
an
offwhite
head
the
ingredients
are
very
apparent
in
the
aroma
you
can
smell
the
coffee
chocolate
it
tastes
of
roasty
malt
the
aforementioned
coffee
chocolate
lactose
is
very
apparent
too
helps
the
silky
mouthfeel
likely
going
to
be
one
of
my
faves
from
the
box
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
to
the
cloying
level
but
a
nic
elingering
sweetness
with
a
bitterness
that
snaps
at
the
tongue
the
aroma
on
this
is
just
wonderful
with
a
big
coffee
aroma
that
has
a
sharp
almost
acidic
lactic
contrasting
note
the
flavor
is
sharply
acidic
with
a
mellow
coffee
character
that
combines
with
the
chocolate
and
lactic
souring
to
make
for
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
i
enjoyed
every
sip
of
this
immensely
overall
i
am
going
against
the
grain
on
this
beer
in
part
as
it
doesnt
fit
the
profile
on
the
label
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
lactose
and
a
much
fuller
and
creamier
mouthfeel
and
also
because
the
acrid
finish
is
slightly
unpleasant
taste
definitely
strong
sturdy
and
coffee
some
chocolatecocoa
notes
are
most
definitely
there
but
this
is
far
and
away
a
beer
for
coffee
lovers
serious
and
worldclass
mouthfeel
is
great
and
overall
a
great
beer
huge
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
feels
like
a
mix
between
a
mocha
and
boulder
brewings
shake
chocolate
porter
not
a
big
fan
of
coffee
in
my
beers
but
this
is
a
great
exception
oa
decent
beer
but
nothing
stellar
tastecoffee
and
cream
smooth
yet
robust
with
a
faintly
sweet
finish
overall
4

this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
start
to
finish
its
not
as
big
rich
deep
or
complex
as
a
massive
american
doublerussian
imperial
stout
but
it
retains
a
lot
of
the
best
qualities
from
those
styles
and
imparts
it
on
a
relatively
moderatelysized
extremely
satisfying
milk
stout
its
not
syrupy
or
as
sweet
as
some
milk
stouts
can
be
instead
its
a
smoother
balanced
take
on
an
americanstyle
coffee
stout
it
definitely
benefits
from
being
a
little
larger
than
other
milk
stouts
as
it
wraps
in
more
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
than
others
overall
its
just
an
extremely
good
beer
and
i
wish
it
were
a
regular
overall
a
delicious
beer
gives
fbs
a
serious
run
for
the
money
inky
black

with
a
thick

powder

a

sweet
but
not
too
finishing
with
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
and
distant
piney

well
balanced
and
tasty
a
rare
noteworthy
brew
from
the
beer
camp
twelve
pack
got
to
be
honest
i
was
a
little
scared
but
the
double
latte
description
but
it
was
excellent
with
a
nice
coffee
stout
taste
and
hint
of
milk
in
the
finish
o
exceeded
my
expectations
really
well
done
overall
ok
but
nothing
too
special
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
black
opaque
without
any
ruby
red
highlights
at
the
edge
the
dark
tan
head
holds
well
and
is
very
thick
tastes
is
a
nice
interplay
between
roasted
notes
and
coffee
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
lingers
sweetness
the
mix
of
coffee
roast
chocolate
and
sweetness
is
balanced
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
and
want
but
it
isnt
thin
very
good
beer
and
im
surprised
and
the
abv
love
you
sierra
nevada
this
is
coffee
stout
first
and
milk
stout
second
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
the
coffee
was
roasty
and
lightly
bitter
without
any
of
the
sourness
some
coffee
beers
have
there
was
a
bit
of
lactic
sweetness
towards
the
end
which
worked
well
with
the
dark
chocolaty
malt
this
is
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
one
of
the
best
from
the
pack
bottle
poured
a
light
color
black
stout
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
coffee
notes
with
some
dry
roasted
malt
is
quite
interesting
taste
is
dominated
by
nice
flora
coffee
notes
which
are
dry
but
not
astringent
chocolate
notes
are
also
quite
interesting
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
one
of
the
best
beer
from
this
beer
camp
series
smooth
from
start
to
finish
long
lasting
aftertaste
slow
sipping
but
a
meal
in
a
glass
damn
good
nearly
excellent
i
nice
beer
but
just
a
bit
over
done
with
the
coffee
in
my
opinion
o
they
really
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
really
well
made
and
tasty
hopefully
this
one
is
brewed
sometime
again
d
the
pick
of
the
litter
winner
winner
double
latte
dinner
that
seems
to
be
the
consensus
at

so
one
can
only
hope
they
make
more
of
this
a
real
nice
treat
and
the
best
of
the
bunch
bravo
o
ive
got
two
left
from
my
twelve
pack
and
i
gotta
say
this
has
been
my
favorite
camper
thus
far
well
done
roasty
and
nutty
with
an
ample
coffee
presence
and
a
light
lingering
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
astringency
though
still
creamy
from
the
lactose
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
from
the
series

i
loved
this
stout
and
would
by
a
12
pack
if
the
sold
it
best
beer
in
the
beer
camp

o
quite
possible
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
ever
had
4
25
o
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
12
but
there
were
some
other
notables
as
well
o
right
up
there
with
founders
breakfast
stout
and
terrapin
wake
n
bake
a
little
less
coffee
forward
though
with
more
emphasis
on
the
latte
side
of
the
flavor
satisfying
easy
drinkin
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
12pack
o
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
lactose
could
easily
be
a
substituent
for
morning
coffee
definitely
in
the
running
for
the
best
in
the
12pack
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
coffee
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
bought
the
beer
camp
across
america
for
the
mix
the
double
latte
is
a
great
start
overall
i
dont
really
love
milk
stouts
so
this
one
is
tough
the
flavors
are
rich
i
just
dont
like
that
sweetness
o
i
am
not
a
big
stout
fan
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
milk
stouts
generally
have
a
great
mouthfeel
and
this
one
is
no
exception
if
the
taste
mimicked
the
nose
a
little
closer
this
would
be
top
notch
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
in
every
regard
no
hops
over
whelming
the
beer
again
best
one
of
the
12
pack
which
was
not
worth
it
imho
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
coffee
stout
great
taste
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
some
nice
cream
and
smokey
notes
o
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
from
the
beer
camp
compilation
lots
of
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
very
enjoyable
overall
not
very
happy
with
this
beer
maybe
it
was
just
the
bottle
i
had
but
it
was
sub
par
imo
overall
a
musttry
beer
im
sorry
its
a
oneoff
very
tasty
milk
stout
here
makes
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
one
hell
of
a
deal
for
the
variety
you
get
i
am
very
glad
i
saved
this
one
for
last
a
stellar
beer
that
is
not
only
the
shining
star
of
beer
camp
but
is
a
superb
beer
on
its
own
an
excellent
example
of
why
you
shouldnt
write
off
a
brewery
as
they
may
surprise
you
with
their
next
brew
easily
the
best
in
the
12
pack
this
has
a
nice
staying
power
that
may
cry
for
a
permanent

followed
by
some

the
conventional
bitter

whoa
after
taking
a
sip
im
confused
if
its
a
dark
roast
coffee
or
a
beer
quite
an
intense
coffee
flavor
a
little
dry
hop
at
the
end
and
some
sweetness
but
coffee
coffee
coffee
lighter
than
expected
on
the
mouthfeel
which
is
always
nice
with
these
big
stouts
not
exactly
my
type
of
go
to
beer
but
its
advertised
as
a
double
latte
and
boy
did
they
hit
it
right
on
kinda
crazy
that
the
two
stouts
in
the
beer
camp
turned
out
to
be
the
best
beers
o
was
expecting
more
coffee
and
sugar
and
less
hops
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
could
have
used
more
flavor
overall
though
o
the
base
beer
is
a
decent
milk
stout
but
the
real
attraction
is
the
absolutely
masterful
use
of
the
famed
stumptown
coffee
a
few
tweaks
here
and
there
to
the
base
recipe
and
youd
have
a
worldbeating
beer
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
balance
of
black
coffee
bitterness
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
olove
this
beer
make
some
more
o
starts
out
like
a
strong
cup
of
espresso
but
then
the
sweetness
of
the
lactose
comes
through
i
personally
enjoy
both
aspects
very
enjoyable

vanilla
here
lasting
coffee
notes
and
very
pleasant
on
the
tongue
silky
and
smooth
but
only
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
drinkable
milk
stout
ill
have
more
overall
a
big
and
robust
smooth
mocha
latte
flavored
brew
that
soothes
the
mouth
as
well
as
the
soul
this
is
a
quite
delicious
sweet
lactose
and
coffee
flavored
brew
overall
o
this
is
a
treat
to
drink
its
my
last
of
the
camp
and
my
favorite
the
coffee
is
the
superstar
in
here
and
its
balanced
so
well
within
the
beer
that
each
sip
is
a
delight
not
as
good
as
an
fbs
but
still
a
really
really
nice
beer
to
drink
if
you
dont
like
coffee
beers
stay
away
if
you
do
dive
right
in
o
pretty
good
offering
not
the
best
in
the
series
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
good
stuff
for
sure

this
is
an

all
around
great

flavors
and
very
smooth
to

on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
coffee
and
double
cream
stout
is
how
i
would
characterize
this
one
drinks
easy
and
i
would
definitely
bring
a
bottle
of
this
to
work
every
morning
if
i
was
permitted
and
it
was
more
readily
available
m
smooth
but
oddly
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
the
strength
overall
i
can
see
why
this
one
has
come
with
a
good
reputation
flavorwise
it
is
one
of
the
more
assertive
beers
in
the
beer
camp
pack
and
it
seems
any
beer
with
coffee
is
sure
to
get
a
bump
in
enjoyment
these
days
not
that
i
blame
peoplei
love
coffee
beers
too
that
said
i
prefer
my
coffee
in
non
milksweet
stouts
because
i
love
the
drier
characteristic
but
to
this
beers
credit
it
is
a
conceptual
success
with
the
lactose
and
coffee
playing
to
make
double
latte
as
close
to
a
double
latte
as
beer
can
get
o
a
great
stout
best
of
the
12
pack
imo
overall
pretty
great
roasty
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
i
think
it
could
just
a
bit
less
attenuation
to
add
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
that
is
just
nitpicking
o
a
good
stout
brings
a
lotta
classic
stout
elements
to
bear
the
espresso
the
bittersweet
cocoa
in
a
milk
stout
with
enough
smoothness
and
lactose
to
make
sure
you
know
what
youre
drinking
overall
decent
yet
missing
a
real
punch
too
tame
and
mild
for
its
own
good
nothing
to
revisit
again
with
so
many
better
other
milk
stouts
out
there
pours
black
with
massive
tan
head
that
sticks
around
quite
a
bit
smells
roasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
with
some
light
roasts
and
chocolate
notes
slightly
acrid
aftertaste
bitter
and
roasty
feels
full
could
have
this
with
breakfast
lunch
or
dinner
feels
lush
and
velvetlike
great
beer
among
the
best
in
the
beer
camp
sampler
o
this
one
is
exactly
as
advertised
a
nice
big
coffeeforward
stout
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
that
plays
well
off
the
coffee
bitterness
o
one
of
the
better
uses
of
coffee
i
have
had
in
a
stout
very
tasty
on
the
tongue
the
coffee
is
sharper
and
more
bitter
than
in
the
nose
the
body
is
very
pleasantly
smooth
with
a
clean
dry
finish
overall
not
really
my
bottle
of
beer
but
if
you
like
java
beers
im
certain
youll
love
it
go
grab
the
12
pack
o
this
beer
starts
off
tasting
like
a
black
coffee
but
if
you
give
it
a
chance
to
warm
up
the
lactose
peeks
through
and
it
starts
to
resemble
something
closer
to
a
latte
i
love
dark
beers
and
this
had
some
amazing
flavors
the
pour
was
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
coffee
colored
head
that
lasts
the
smell
was
full
of
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
was
my
favorite
part
with
a
lot
of
sweet
flavors
like
chocolate
and
cream
in
the
beginning
with
great
coffee
and
espresso
flavors
finish
the
brew
giving
it
a
semisweet
bitter
ending
i
thought
it
was
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
also
really
good
with
a
thick
beer
that
coats
your
mouth
but
isnt
overly
syrupy
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
beer
camp
i
think
overall
i
would
have
to
crown
this
one
king
of
the
beercamp
series
even
without
trying
the
other
three
i
could
be
wrong
and
if
i
am
i
will
certainly
correct
myself
in
those
reviews
it
would
be
fun
to
have
a
few
of
these
but
alas
i
only
have
one
more
and
it
isnt
cold
yet
the
point
is
this
is
a
nice
one
o
this
is
a
great
beer
to
finish
off
the
beer
camp
snbills
order
was
a
great
one
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
whole
experience
i
really
want
a
12
can
mix
pack
the
verdict
excellent
rich
creamy
and
delicious
this
is
the
star
of
beer
camp
its
so
good
i
dont
want
to
finish
it
because
then
it
will
be
gone
and
all
ill
have
left
is
a
memory
great
rendition
of
a
coffee
beer
it
lacks
the
acrid
character
of
hot
pressing
and
cheap
beans
im
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
and
wish
the
chocolate
were
more
pronounced
a
bit
bitter
for
me
as
it
warms
more
chocolate
flavor
comes
out
but
the
bitter
aftertaste
isnt
me
fave
overall
a
milk
stout
that
is
just
done
to
near
perfection
the
way
i
like
it
one
of
the
styles
i
am
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
and
very
picky
of
fantastic
brew
pours
out
black
with
ruby
highlights
moderate
sized
khakicolored
head
nose
if
coffee
nice
stout
backbone
but
smells
so
strongly
of
coffee
flavor
is
big
on
coffee
as
well
slight
tartness
big
sweetness
nice
roasted
malts
with
chocolate
tones
almost
saline
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
soft
carbonation
and
full
mouthfeel
awesome
coffee
stout
runs
sweet
but
thats
par
for
the
style
bitter
edges
try
to
balance
good
but
lacks
the
general
high
drinkability
of
the
rest
of
the
pack
a
little
shot
of
warmth
in
the
gut
and
that
is
to
be
expected
i
like
this
drink
o
really
nice
coffee
flavored
milk
stout
nice
flavors
pours
pitch
black
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
is
okay
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
sweet
roasted
malt
predominate
the
aroma
with
coffee
and
hints
of
milk
chocolate
roasted
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
coffee
like
bitterness
followed
by
a
slight
chocolate
taste
there
is
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
great
beer
but
it
is
like
most
other
similar
stouts
nothing
new
with
this
one
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
i
can
certainly
appreciate
how
well
rounded
well
crafted
and
full
of
various
flavors
this
beer
is
this
would
be
nice
as
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
the
sweetness
from
the
bourbon
would
complement
the
sweetness
from
the
lactose
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
dead
of
winter
type
of
beer
for
me
ocoffee
themed
beers
are
some
of
the
most
exciting
and
stimulating
experiences
craft
beer
has
to
offer
on
that
note
i
enjoyed
double
latte
very
much
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
would
enjoy
a
better
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
o
good
coffee
stout
aroma
is
the
hight
point
here
but
everything
is
pretty
good
i
certainly
would
drink
more
of
this
if
i
am
able
to
find
some
overall
impressive
from
the
first
to
last
sip
i
wish
every
beer
in
the
pack
felt
like
thiswhat
a
great
beer
a
well
executed
coffee
milk
stout
maybe
the
best
beer
in
the
box
i
am
down
to
my
last
few
and
this
could
be
the
winner
here
its
a
beautiful
dark
almost
black
brown
with
a
full
inch
of
what
literally
looks
like
latte
foam
milky
and
stained
slightly
from
the
coffee
but
fully
thick
and
structurally
intact
the
nose
is
clad
pressed
minimally
acidic
coffee
first
maybe
a
little
stale
but
giving
life
to
robust
roasted
barley
character
in
the
beer
i
dont
smell
sweetness
from
milk
sugar
rather
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
like
raw
chocolate
the
flavor
shows
only
minimal
milk
sugar
too
and
its
all
in
the
finish
balancing
the
compound
bitter
aspects
of
both
the
coffee
and
the
grain
bill
its
dynamic
and
well
integrated
nothing
stands
out
but
all
additives
can
be
tasted
as
accent
flavors
in
a
delicious
base
brew
alcohol
strength
is
subtle
but
keeps
me
drinking
it
slow
which
allows
it
to
warm
up
to
room
temperature
and
i
find
it
even
more
complex
then
with
the
coffee
standing
out
a
little
more
smooth
beer
but
not
enough
body
for
me
it
seems
to
thin
to
support
all
the
flavor
packed
into
it
and
the
same
with
the
booze
it
needs
more
weight
not
much
but
its
a
few
points
light
for
me
overall
though
an
enormously
delicious
beer
makes
the
whole
box
worth
it
not
that
it
wasnt
before
this
is
primo
overall
on
its
own
this
is
on
of
the
best
beers
to
come
from
sierra
nevada
o
i
think
this
is
great
so
smooth
and
balanced
all
the
flavors
play
very
well
together
nothing
too
dominant
wish
theyd
put
this
out
again
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
the
beer
camp
box
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
one
a
solid
milk
stout
for
real
nice
collab

great
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
after
a
few
sips
the
coffee
starts
to
fall
back
into
a
bigger
picture
i
do
indeed
like
it
but
it
might
be
even
better
with
just
a
smidge
less
coffee
overall
this
is
a
very
good
coffee
stout
this
12
pack
just
keeps
impressing
me
12oz
bottle
served
in
a

pours
one
shade
shy
of
black
with
a
tight
14
inch
khakicolored
head
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
solid
18th
inch
skim
with
semiconcentric
half
bands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
coffee
roast
and
a
hint
of
lactose
towards
the
back
taste
follows
nose
a
pleasant
coffee
milk
flavor
profile
with
a
little
chalkiness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
crisp
even
carbonation
just
an
all
around
great
coffee
milk
stout
too
bad
its
a
oneoff
would
live
to
see
it
in
cans
o
i
generally
like
this
style
and
this
does
not
disappoint
at
all
great
effort
the
beer
pours
a
decent
creamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
thin
tannish
head
on
the
beer
the
beer
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
a
very
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black
obviously
the
beer
is
opaque
because
of
the
color
the
beer
smell
has
strong
roasted
notes
and
bitter
coffee
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
the
coffee
notes
comes
in
two
varieties
dark
and
roasted
the
lactose
also
adds
a
slightly
sweet
note
but
gets
lost
in
the
coffee
the
taste
has
the
same
notes
but
the
coffee
notes
are
not
as
strong
and
as
a
result
the
lactose
is
stronger
but
still
slightly
faint
the
roasted
coffee
is
also
closer
to
the
point
where
you
get
a
better
sense
of
where
the
coffee
starts
and
where
the
malts
start
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
and
thick
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
collaboration
the
beer
is
a
lot
more
roasted
than
the
average
milk
stout
but
the
addition
of
the
coffee
makes
it
taste
really
indulgent
i
kinda
wish
i
could
drink
this
for
breakfast
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
a
2
inch
tan
head
that
sticked
around
for
a
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
lactosecream
and
some
nuts
i
think
the
taste
is
mostly
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
vanilla
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
tied
for
being
my
favorite
beer
in
the
beer
camp
12
pack
id
like
to
see
this
brew
brought
back
at
some
point
fresh
pour
into
tulip
glass
looks
inviting
no
to
bubbly
but
lots
of
head
here
looks
lends
to
a
creamy
and
bold
full
bodied
beer
smell
is
definitely
not
latte
up
front
as
the
label
reads
double
latte
however
i
do
get
the
coffee
bean
for
sure
milk
stout
wlactose
taste
is
smooth
no
too
boozy
roasted
malts
red
malts
carmel
malts
some
roastiness
and
coffee
is
more
apparent
on
the
tongue
more
than
the
nose
hops
are
present
lending
some
buttering
notes
to
the
finish
more
of
german
or
english
hops
than
american
seems
which
keeps
the
profile
on
point
i
like
the
character
of
the
beer
and
the
full
body
helps
pull
throughout
the
strong
coffee
and
roasty
flavor
overall
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
blackened
piece
of
fish
bangers
and
mash
or
lamb
stew
desserts
will
pair
very
well
here
o
overall
this
beer
is
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
ive
had
much
much
worse
milk
stouts
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
ninkasi
but
i
did
enjoy
this
typical
jet
black
stout
pour
with
a
semidirty
head
the
nose
was
not
as
full
in
terms
of
coffee
or
chocolate
but
one
i
tasted
it
i
realized
how
incredibly
smooth
this
was
its
like
taking
a
nice
stout
couple
of
pieces
of
good
rich
chocolate
one
or
two
aromatic
coffee
beans
start
to
digest
all
of
them
and
then
slowly
have
a
small
glass
of
rich
creamy
milk
for
me
it
would
be
vanilla
almond
mik
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
across
america
double
latte
45
overall
a
decent
coffee
milk
stout
there
are
better
cheaper
options
available
year
round
here
in
the
chicagoland
area
so
ill
stick
with
something
else
overall
i
like
the
coffee
flavors
in
this
beer
but
it
is
way
too
roasted
for
me
its
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
of
the
roast
overall
really
good
beer
and
a
good
representation
the
only
thing
that
is
off
is
the
mouthfeel
but
everything
else
is
well
done
definitely
worth
a
try
transient
cafe
brown
head
fades
quickly
over
a
murky

o
this
is
the

of

series
i
have
had
i
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
in
my
area
a
fullbodied
beer
great
to
drink
for
dessert
but
with
that
depth
of
flavor
a
heartier
body
is
expected
i
would
like
to
see
what
damage
this
beer
could
do
at
near
tenpercent
alcohol
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki

that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the

foamy
swaths
of

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

cocoa
powder
brewed
coffee
and
lactose
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
roasted
malt
bittersweet
cocoa
and
burnt
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
mixture
of
cocoa
and
coffee
qualities
all
around
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
of
the
beer
camp
12pack
for
2014
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
enjoy
the
hops
overall
decadent
sipping
stout
without
resorting
to
crazy
alcohol
levels
great
job
the
coffee
notes
explode
into
the
taste
and
then
there
is
a
roastiness
paralleling
with
some
lingering
dry
bitterness
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
overall
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
balance
and
body
that
id
like
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
pours

deep
dark

to
go
along
with
bitter

and
heavy

and
earth
keeps
it
from
being

damn
this
is
a
great
sweet
stout
with
ballsthe
best
of
the
beer
camp
across
american
pack
so
far
for
me
by
a
wide
margin
a
very
well
done
stout
i
really
wish
i
could
get
a
6pack
of
this
pours

a

with

sweetness
joined
by

slowly

more

reminiscent
of
dark

by
dark

lightly
bitter
espresso
mellows
to
milky

mediumbodied
with
moderate

a
nice
solid
stout
the
coffee
does
well
to
emphasize
qualities
of
the
base
beer
rather
than
overpowering
it
o
great
stuff
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
a
coffee
beer
without
being
overly
sweet
overall
3

great
stout
with
excellent
balance
and
flavor
focus
however
this
was
a
stout
that
was
just
a
bit
too
much
of
a
chimera
for
me
an
unequal
melding
of
parts
i
thought
the
finish
was
too
sweet
and
the
smoothness
seemed
a
bit
forced
and
artificial
this
is
a
delicious
brew
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
the
best
milk
stout
that
i
have
ever
tasted
but
thats
not
much
of
a
complement
also
why
add
actual
coffee
it
eliminates
the
possibility
of
making
your
brew
a
session
beer
who
wants
to
be
buzzed
and
wired
at
the
same
time
you
can
mimic
coffee
flavor
with
varieties
of
toasted
grains
overall
delicious
beer
allaround
thus
far
the
prize
of
the
snbcaa
12pack
of
course
when
you
love
stouts
like
i
do
theyll
almost
always
be
my
fave
in
a
mixed
pack
another
gem

the

upfront
medium

also
has
really
nice
flavors
of
roasted

vanilla

espresso
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
very
end
overall
a
nice
coffee
beer
i
like
the
lactic
chocolate
and
coffee
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
much
harsh
bitter
roast
o
personally
i
felt
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
good
until
i
got
about
half
way
down
as
the
beer
warmed
the
lactose
seemed
to
fade
away
leaving
a
somewhat
unexciting
but
still
drinkable
bitter
coffee
stout
i
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
due
to
the
fact
that
i
disagree
with
the
overwhelming
positive
reviews
this
beer
is
getting
more
power
to
those
who
enjoy
this
but
this
is
the
weakest
milke
stout
ive
ever
had
comparing
this
to
say
mikellers
milk
shake
is
like
comparing
night
and
day
this
brew
touts
its
inclusion
of
lactose
and
coffee
the
coffee
is
apparent
when
tasting
but
there
is
little
to
no
aroma
to
be
had
for
a
beer
that
pushes
the
coffee
as
for
the
milk
all
i
get
is
a
fake
tasting
milk
like
overtone
there
are
plenty
of
milk
stouts
out
there
that
can
make
an
authentic
tasting
milky
flavor
but
lactose
or
not
this
is
not
it
the
after
taste
is
where
the
coffee
really
settles
in
but
its
not
enough
to
hold
together
this
brew
i
had
the
maillards
odyssey
from
the
same
pack
which
was
very
well
done
so
i
was
a
bit
more
than
a
little
disappointed
when
i
tried
this
an
unfortunate
brew
the
consensus
best
of
the
beer
camp
and
i
wholeheartedly
agree
this
is
a
delicious
beer
perfect
for
dessert
or
breakfast
o
a
fine
delicious
example
of
a
milk
stout
i
wish
it
were
available
yearround
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
airy
overall
its
quite
good
peace
pours
a
brownish
black
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
spots
on
the
glass
a
decent
amount
of
coffee
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
evident
as
well
as
the
standard
sn
yeast
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
a
decent
amount
of
lactose
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
coffee
the
finish
has
a
light
roastiness
as
well
as
a
light
bitterness
medium
body
mediumlow
carbonation
this
has
been
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
ive
had
besides
a
barrel
aged
or
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
this
is
full
of
big
coffee
and
chocolate
this
is
a
very
smooth
stout
with
a
great
texture
in
the
mouth
this
is
the
best
in
the
beer
camp
pack
o
superb
i
hugely
enjoyed
this
wouldwill
have
again
o
impressive
flavor
and
aroma
the
beer
drinks
silky
smooth
id
consider
it
an
awesome
milk
stout
i
must
knock
it
on
the
booze
according
to
style
but
i
prefer
beers
boozy
anyway
c
12
oz
bottle
from
whole
foods
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
billowing
head
of
khaki
froth
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
ground
coffee
beans
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
features
a
black
coffee
roasted
bitterness
though
a
little
warming
helps
balance
things
out
hops
are
earthy
and
meld
fairly
seamlessly
with
the
bitterness
of
the
roast
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
which
helps
along
with
the
lactose
to
moderate
the
bold
bitterness
great
balance
light
and
tasty
is
a
rare
combination
that
deserves
extra
points
love
the
low
abv
this
one
is
an
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
from
stone
that
had
a
good
balance
and
went
down
easy
enough
but
ultimately
failed
to
excite
it
was
quite
an
average
beer
for
me
really
and
not
one
id
be
likely
to
go
back
to
again
while
it
definitely
wasnt
a
bad
one
from
the
brewery
it
never
really
hit
the
heights
of
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
or
even
left
hands
milk
stout
but
it
was
nice
enough
i
guess
bittersweet
surprisingly
mild
coffee
flavor
though
thats
still
the
dominant
note
not
cloying
but
definite
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
though
not
as
thick
as
i
usually
expect
from
a
stout
overall
wasnt
impressed
by
this
one
at
all
seemed
a
little
short
in
all
areas
with
the
exception
of
the
appearance
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
prefer
a
bit
more
coffee
and
a
bit
less
milk
and
a
fuller
body
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
the
smell
and
taste
of
milky
coffee
are
why
i
marked
it
so
high
very
nice
way
too
sweet
this
beer
was
difficult
to
finish
completely
clack
viscus
and
with
a
thin
nearly
nonexistent
head
this
has
an
almoist
oily
appearance
the
smell
is
of
coffee
roasted
grain
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
creamy
texture
and
a
little
coffe
sensation
full
and
luxurious
very
good
overall
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
all
flavours
are
there
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
of
the
lactose
sweetness
to
shine
through
other
than
that
good
roasted
malt
and
coffee
bean
profile
o
this
one
is
a
bit
disappointing
but
when
i
step
back
and
look
at
it
for
what
it
is
it
makes
sense
i
came
in
expecting
a
richer
sweeter
beer
but
at
around
4
thats
pretty
tough
to
achieve
as
a
lighter
body
session
stout
with
a
little
something
extra
in
the
flavor
department
it
does
pretty
well
this
is
odd
i
understand
the
point
was
to
create
a
light
easydrinking
milk
stout
but
even
with
stones
warning
it
still
feels
light
and
underwhelming
this
is
worth
a
try
but
its
not
great
overall
no
balance
all
burned
coffee
and
a
bit
oxidized
at
that
remember
this
is
a
milk
stout
folks
low
abv
with
that
said
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
the
coffee
is
wonderful
a
fun
but
not
outstanding

heavy
coffee

i
had
the
honor
of
drinking
this
draught
from
the
keg
at
the
columbus
winter
beer
fest
very
impressive
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
night
a
pretty
bland
coffee
stout
unfortunately
pretty
easy
to
forget
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
had
on

at

this
afternoon
dark
chocolate
looks
with
a
roasted
and
brown
sugar
nose
a
fuller
feel

roasted

good
but
not
top
notch
although
this
beer
did
hit
the
spot
for
a
cold
winter
day
next
to
the
fireplace
i
was
a
little
disappointed
ive
had
other
milk
stouts
with
more
pronounced
creamy
lactose
sweetness
this
one
lacked
the
aroma
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
began
drinking
tj
from
the
fridge
and
it
seemed
watered
down
i
was
hoping
that
would
subside
with
temperature
it
didnt
bummer
its
loaded
with
lactose
but
the
body
falls

me
good

the
coffee

can
be

this
is

honestly
cant
taste
the

at
all

super
easy

a

id
recommend
it
to
any
dark

drinker
first

around
i
didnt

this

gave
it

it

id
have
it
again
very
milky

delicious
would
drink
again
m
average
i
was
expecting
something
light

i
found
this

its

this

expected
the
scent

taste
werent

they
were
enjoyable
the

the

it
was

expected

things
with
the
pedigree
of
this
brewery
starts
well
with
a
dark
body
and
decent
aroma
of
coffee
but
the
flavor
was
lifeless
watery
coffee
residual
cocoa
very
boring
and
disappointing
i
was
really
surprised
at
the
great
smell
and
loved
the
taste
of
the
beer
its
not
that
great
of
a
stout
style
beer
disappointing
even
though
it
didnt
have
a
high
rating
to
begin
with
a
decent
beer
overall
but
the
combination
of
the
words
coffee
and
milk
stout
simply
carry
so
much
more
promise
and
in
that
sense
this
is
a
touch
disappointing
still
im
glad
to
have
found
out
for
myself
i
was
expecting
good
things
from
this
beer
the
smell
was
that
of
a
coffee
beer
i
thought
it
was
kind
of
thin
or
watery
for
a
stout
it
was
definitely
not
thick
the
taste
was
what
it
claims
to
be
coffee
although
it
was
very
subdued
and
not
pronounced
like
some
other
coffee
stouts
i
maybe
expected
some
sweetness
and
maybe
that
it
why
the
coffee
was
not
in
your
face
as
with
others
it
was
kind
of
nice
to
have
a
milder
coffee
option
out
there
the
flavor
was
good
but
not
earth
shattering
the
bitterness
on
this
was
mild
and
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
would
not
seek
this
out
overall
it
is
an
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
stout
pours

tastes
of
coffee
vanilla
roasted
malts
slight
chocolate
thin
mouthfeel
fine
but
the
coffee
is
too
subtle
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
think
of
it
as
a
session
stout
complex
flavor
and
nice
smell
overall
a
damn
fine
stout
this
is
amazing
beer
a
very
dark
coffr
milk
stout
the
taste
of
coffe
is
not
overpowering
its
looks
too
good
to
be
ture
in
a
glass
love
read
the
others
because
mined
never
do
just
great
beer
o
great
available
session
stout
for
the
ride
home
better
than
i
expected
based
on
the
previous
reviews
if
youre
a
coffee
aficionado
and
like
your
stouts
on
the
bitter
side
this
isnt
half
bad
though
i
would
have
liked
a
fuller
mouthfeel
with
that
said
it
remains
a
sessionable
stout
on
par
with
what
i
would
have
expected
out
of
a
sixpack
from
stone
o
a
no
frills
sessionstrength
coffee
stout
that
gets
the
job
done
worth
trying
not
your
usual
stone
beer
i
was
expecting
espresso
to
a
certain
extent
but
what
i
got
was
more
of
a
latte
its
creamy
coffeelike
cocoaish
milk
chocolatey
and
gently
nutty
with
an
edge
of
sweetish
dark
caramel
thats
almost
like
a
bit
of
candyish
almostburnt
sugar
theres
some
dark
malt
acidity
to
it
but
not
much
and
the
bitterness
level
is
restrained
to
what
id
call
moderate
theres
just
enough
to
balance
it
in
combination
with
the
soft
roasty
dryness
its
easily
drinkable
and
i
guess
it
should
be
at
just
4
2
abv
a
tasty
treat
that
goes
down
to
easily
and
leaves
you
wondering
where
your
beer
went
single
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
very
dark
essentially
pitch
black
brew
with
a
thin
layer
of
rich
tan
creamy
bubbles
on
top
and
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
chocolate
and
coffee
in
approximately
equal
measure
with
some
toffee
notes
as
well
interesting
on
the
palate
there
is
plenty
of
chocolate
but
also
dry
roasted
coffee
bean
to
cut
much
of
the
sweetness
along
with
some
distinct
dark
roasted
barley
notes
chocolate
malt
all
the
way
silky
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
a
notably
dry
roasted
finish
with
little
residual
sweetness
i
probably
would
not
be
able
to
pick
this
out
as
a
clear
milk
stout
as
everyone
says
its
a
diversion
for
stone
and
probably
a
worthwhile
pickup
for
the
english
stout
lover
i
find
myself
yearning
for
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
0
meh
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
it
is
what
it
is
nothing
more
f
this
is
possibly
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
a
beer
like
this
should
be
thick
creamy
and
stick
to
the
inside
of
your
mouth
you
should
still
taste
it
minute
or
two
later
but
sadly
none
of
this
describes
said
beer
its
thin
holds
no
real
body
and
leaves
much
to
be
desired
sorry
stone
love
you
guys
however
this
ones
a
miss
overall
this
was
ok
i
think
the
beer
should
just
be
called
stone
coffee
stout
instead
but
thats
just
me
i
didnt
find
this
one
to
be
too
creamy
or
anything
like
that
i
keep
mentioning
the
bitterness
but
it
was
on
the
verge
of
being
too
much
i
wish
stone
listed
the
ibus
on
their
website
at
4
2
abv
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
your
pals
and
not
get
wrecked
so
for
a
low
abv
beer
this
is
an
absolute
winner
coroandos
blue
ridge
coffee
stout
beats
this
one
hands
down
for
me
try
that
one
if
you
can
find
it
ill
stick
with
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
my
favorite
beer
and
left
hands
milk
stout
nitro
if
im
looking
to
drink
a
beer
in
this
style
as
well
2014nov28
this
is
an
decent
beer
especially
for
those
that
like
coffee
the
beer
has
surprisingly
decent
body
for
a
4
abv
i
still
prefer
my
stouts
with
more
body
but
this
is
good
the
taste
and
scent
are
undeniably
coffee
the
beer
pour
a
pitch
black
with
tan
head
that
is
not
lacing
overall
it
is
decent
o
its
a
good
beer
it
is
not
over
the
top
as
one
would
expect
from
stone
this
is
more
of
a
good
everyday
beer
love
stone
beers
hands
down
but
this
was
not
my
deal
overall
this
is
not
always
my
style
of
beer
i
love
stouts
but
sometimes
an
aggressive
coffee
addition
can
be
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
to
me
in
this
case
however
the
sweetness
balances
it
out
very
nicely
making
this
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
pour
is
black
with
a
brown
sugar
colored
head
nose
is
coffee
and
roast
taste
follows
the
nose
coffee
and
roast
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
drying
quality
and
not
the
smoothness
one
would
expect
of
a
milk
stout
overall
not
a
bad
effort
but
ive
definitely
had
better
in
style
and
far
better
from
stone
very
dark
as
stout
should
be
scents
of
roasted
malts
tastes
like
of
roasted
barley
balanced
with
sweetness
of
the
malts
a
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
very
full
body
and
lingers
on
the
palette
overall
an
excellent
stout
and
very
enjoyable
in
the
cold
winter
months
a
little
bitter
in
the
beginning
but
a
great
finish
overall
a
good
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
overall
a
bit
too
burnt
a
bit
too
milky
a
bit
too
thin
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
coffee
if
you
like
a
coffee
beer
this
one
will
do
it
an
eyeopening
quaff
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
o
sessionable
a
great
brunch
drink
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
thicker
mouthfeel
but
its
still
a
solid
milk
stout
o
the
amount
of
flavor
packed
into
4
2
was
impressive
with
plenty
of
coffee
chocolate
and
sweet
lactose
id
definitely
buy
more
of
this
stone
coffee
milk
stout
was
a
very
nice
way
to
start
my
sunday
morning
what
an
easy
ride
anything
brewed
at
stone
is
done
so
under
the
watchful
eye
of
a
skilled
team
of
people
so
its
no
surprise
to
me
that
this
recipe
found
the
perfect
balance
between
coffee
beans
and
milk
sugar
i
was
expecting
more
i
found
myself
wanting
something
else
with
this
particular
stout
so
i
dropped
some
vanilla
ice
cream
in
there
and
that
helped
overall
not
that
impressive
o
the
flavor
was
fine
no
off
flavors
it
was
just
pretty
bland
the
body
was
very
light
and
lacking
overall
this
is
a
very
underwhelming
offering
from
stone
the
roastiness
is
very
low
for
a
coffee
stout
major
mehh
on
this
one
best
part
was
the
initial
pour
which
provided
a
stunning
inch
tall
light
chocolate
colored
head
stout
itself
was
swallowing
light
which
is
to
be
expected
with
a
stout
but
turned
out
to
be
shocking
that
it
did
given
the
thinness
of
this
one
smell
was
lightly
of
coffee
but
little
else
taste
followed
the
same
line
but
was
thin
in
taste
like
it
was
folgers
coffee
that
was
used
i
am
also
a
coffee
snob
dark
french
roast
from
like
starbucks
is
my
start
point
for
good
coffee
finish
was
equally
thin
with
a
decent
lingering
aftertaste
i
typically
swoon
over
anything
with
a
gargoyle
on
it
but
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
miss
overall
i
realize
that
this
beer
is
not
going
for
imperial
type
presence
and
i
suppose
it
does
a
pretty
damn
good
job
at
delivering
a
lot
of
flavor
in
a
small
package
i
just
wish
the
taste
was
as
nuanced
as
the
smell
i
couldnt
help
but
feel
the
charred
malt
roastiness
really
shot
down
the
complexities
i
found
in
the
nose
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
overall
promising
but
ultimately
disappointing
the
flavor
starts
off
delicious
but
soon
fades
into
mediocrity
leaving
mostly
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
along
with
the
persistent
hop
and
probably
roasted
malt
bitterness
the
aroma
is
rather
nice
but
expresses
little
more
than
coffee
and
cream
otherwise
very
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
this
turned
out
to
be
considerably
better
than
my
first
impression
good
flavor
and
aroma
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
enameled
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
this
is
a
remarkably
poor
beer
imo
the
label
says
its
popular
at
the
brewery
and
that
its
creamy
the
six
pack
i
had
were
all
extremely
thin
no
head
or
lacing
and
far
from
creamy
this
is
a
nicely
done
session
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
its
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
and
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
its
just
not
quite
an
excellent
example
of
either
however
its
certainly
what
i
expected
when
i
popped
the
bottle
and
its
stone
so
obviously
its
going
to
be
pretty
good
even
if
its
not
their
best
ever
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
milk
stout
m
overall
drinkability
by
itself
its
a
good
stout
but
this
beer
would
be
better
paired
with
dessert
i
wish
i
had
some
cookies
to
go
with
this
i
like
how
the
milk
sugars
and
coffee
are
distinct
flavors
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
an
evening
but
this
is
a
good
complimentary
dessert
beer
that
wont
be
a
super
rich
beer
experience
but
still
a
very
good
one
ill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
again
the
nose
is
filled
with
lactose
cream
molasses
marshmallow
dry
chocolate
and
light
espresso
bean
the
flavor
is
light
but
delicious
lots
of
coffee
dry
roast
chocolate
syrup
malt
and
lactose
creaminess
this
is
incredibly
thin
which
is
detracting
especially
for
the
style
but
from
a
flavor
standpoint
its
very
good
amazing
for
such
a
low
abv
just
not
feeling
this
beer
for
a
few
reasons
the
coffee
is
not
nearly
as
smooth
robust
or
portrayed
as
well
as
many
of
the
great
coffee
brews
out
there
nowadays
an
acidity
also
comes
into
play
on
the
palate
which
clashes
with
the
heavily
roast
grains
while
i
like
the
idea
of
a
lowabv
coffee
stout
the
body
here
does
not
fully
support
the
flavors
even
with
the
added
lactose
smells
of
faint
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
follows
suit
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
but
certainly
a
pleasant
level
of
flavor
it
tastes
like
chilled
mediumstrength
coffee
after
a
bite
of
dark
chocolate
definitely
nice
for
when
you
want
to
have
stout
flavor
without
the
accompanying
heavy
body
and
abv
personally
i
am
not
yet
so
heavily
into
coffee
in
my
beer
or
otherwise
but
i
wouldnt
say
ill
never
have
it
again
i
found
this
one
to
be
mediocre
not
a
ton
of
complexity
the
flavor
seemed
like
it
was
lacking
at
times
cant
win
em
all

it
may
be
blasphemy
to
say
but
to
me
this
is
the
session
version
of
old
rasputin
stout
the
pour
is
of
a
deep
black
with
brown
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
toasty
goodness
along
with
coffee
earthy
and
a
bit
of
black
currant
taste
is
not
of
what
i
would
co
wider
a
milk
stout
but
it
is
a
mild
back
end
sweetness
that
is
barely
there
good
session
beer
for
winter
will
buy
again
the
pour
is
a
thin
black
with
some
dark
beige
foam
the
nose
is
great
chocolate
coffee
the
taste
is
roasted
bitter
coffee
definitely
thin
for
my
liking
o
good
coffee
flavor
thats
light
as
expected
for
the
style
but
i
wish
it
was
sweeter
and
had
more
of
a
lactose
presence
just
not
a
well
balanced
stout
and
proof
that
not
everything
under
the
sun
needs
to
be
released
to
the
public
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
black
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
toasty
and
roasted
with
a
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
follows
suit
with
roasted
tones
faint
coffee
and
more
smoke
flavor
lactose
sugar
adds
to
the
creamy
feel
of
the
body
and
perhaps
a
faint
creamy
sweetness
hops
are
barely
noticeable
letting
the
grain
and
coffee
flavor
take
center
stage
its
a
nice
little
beer
even
if
tame
pours

with

overall
good

body
and

this
is
my
first
milk
stout
i
think
i
like
it
a
lot
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
tasty
brew
if
you
like
your
beer
to
taste
like
coffee
instead
of
well
beer
didnt
really
taste
much
of
the
milk
stout
part
of
this
one
probably
a
good
fit
if
you
are
one
of
those
who
is
always
trying
to
figure
out
which
beer
goes
with
ice
cream
or
chocolate
chip
cookies
mmmmm
cookies
a
decent
version
of
the
style
the
nose
promising
a
sweet
sickly
affair
which
was
soon
kiboshed
by
the
sour
and
ashy
characters
rendering
a
pleasantly
drinkable
experience
overall
in
fact
as
things
wound
down
to
the
end
i
found
myself
starting
to
marvel
at
how
light
it
all
was
despite
what
it
still
looked
like
neat
very
drinkable
but
wish
it
presented
a
little
bit
more
o
not
very
impressed
its
thin
and
astringent
and
just
not
very
good
on
the
thin
side
for
a
milk
stout
a
little
coffee
a
little
chocolate
medium
carb
a
little
thin
sessionable
overall
nice
stout
best
if
you
enjoy
a
combination
both
strong
coffee
and
malts
flavors
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
i
do
prefer
stones
imperial
russian
stout
though
smells
and
tastes
very
similar
with
strong
notesflavors
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
smooth
to
drink
and
refreshing
for
a
stout
definitely
a
decent
beer
worth
a
second
try
jet
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
light
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
covers
about
half
of
the
top
aroma
is
of
lactose
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
a
nice
complementary
blend
of
moderately
bitter
and
slightly
smoky
coffee
and
sweet
lactose
the
mouth
is
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
o
a
recommended
coffee
stout
given
the
rarity
of
its
low
abv
o
i
thought
this
was
tasty
but
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
has
some
seriously
roasty
flavors
and
big
black
coffee
as
someone
who
drinks
his
coffee
black
i
enjoyed
this
one
though
i
think
it
could
use
more
milk
in
the
milk
stout
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
style
wise
i
cant
find
a
flaw
in
it
also
for
a
brewery
known
for
huge
abrasive
beer
with
giant
abv
and
crazy
ideas
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
simple
style
done
with
a
modern
variation
and
done
expertly
well
i
dont
read
others
reviews
before
i
write
my
own
but
im
interested
to
see
where
it
lost
points
for
its
overall
if
they
ever
exists
on
nitro
i
would
buy
a
plane
ticket
to
get
it
well
done
stone
now
that
your
building
a
facility
in
va
im
looking
forward
to
access
to
more
of
your
offerings
ok
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
way
over
priced
at
20
a
6er
here
in
alberta
this
might
be
a
hard
sell
beside
their
ipa
on
the
same
shelf
for
the
same
price
pours
deep
black
with
a
thick
creamy
darker
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
leaving
some
light
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
combination
of
the
lactic
sweetness
the
coffee
and
a
slight
roasted
malt
astringency
the
taste
is
not
a
punch
in
the
mouth
as
the
style
could
be
but
a
subtle
balancing
of
all
the
flavors
in
a
lower
abv
body
it
really
comes
in
to
its
own
as
it
warms
to
about
50f
the
body
is
lighter
as
a
milk
stout
should
be
with
a
nice
silky
quality
to
it
a
sessionable
and
flavorful
stout
overall
decent
flavor
but
thin
and
watery
this
would
be
a
good
light
session
beer
if
you
wanted
more
flavor
from
a
light
beer
but
if
youre
used
to
fullbodied
stouts
this
will
not
satisfy
you
rjt
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
lighter
bodied
than
i
expected
modestly
carbonated
providing
a
nice
smooth
feel
not
quite
silky
but
nice
flavors
mesh
together
nicely
has
a
long
lingering
flavor
despite
the
light
feel
ing
the
tongue
not
overly
drinkable
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
its
more
of
a
sipper
but
kudos
on
the
big
flavor
for
a
a
beer
thats
badly
over
4
abv
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
it
tasted
more
what
id
expect
if
they
did
a
smoked
porter
series
brewed
over
coffee
beans
also
really
expensive
for
a
low
alcohol
six
pack
still
a
good
beer
though
glad
i
got
to
try
it
very
light
stout
with
a
very
minimal
coffee
flavor
after
taste
amazingly
flavorful
for
4
2
abv
nicely
done
stone
id
pass
on
this
one
my
peeps
this
was
unfortunately
stale
coffee
in
nose
and
taste
almost
too
smokey
and
roasty
almost
burnt
lacked
enough
sweetness
and
balance
surprised
by
this
sadly
disappointed
overall
if
you
like
coffee
and
want
something
low
in
abv
then
this
is
certainly
your
brew
it
packs
tons
of
coffee
flavor
in
and
leaves
you
with
a
taste
that
is
almost
as
though
you
had
just
taken
down
an
iced
coffee
for
the
abv
i
must
say
it
is
a
rather
decent
go
too
as
long
as
you
want
a
cup
of
coffee
with
your
beer
overall
even
at
only
4
2
abv
in
classic
stone
style
it
is
over
the
top
in
at
least
one
characteristic
with
this
one
being
coffee
i
must
say
though
actually
that
it
is
a
rather
interesting
and
tasty
brew
tried
it
on
draft
for
the
first
time
tonight
a
decent
stout
effort
from
stone
but
not
their
best
brew
medium
bodied
not
very
coffee
flavored
which
is
a
good
thing
imho
better
to
start
the
evening
with
than
to
end
it
with
for
the
abv
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
rated
it
3
25
compared
to
bigger
beers
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
if
you
want
to
quaff
a
few
i
would
buy
it
again
the
texture
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
sorry
stone
this
one
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
overall
cool
intro
beer
sounds
extreme
but
probably
a
great
brew
to
convert
the
guinness
crowd
overall
impression
an
average
thin
stout
misses
the
mark
on
multiple
levels
for
me
overall
i
really
like
milk
stouts
so
ive
tried
stones
coffee
milk
stout
several
times
in
bottles
and
draft
but
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
too
bitter
too
much
coffee
not
enough
sweetness
i
like
the
low
abv
but
the
beer
doesnt
lend
itself
to
having
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
decent
but
i
was
expecting
more
taste
is
not
surprisingly
cold
black
coffeee
its
a
very
smooth
drink
no
doubt
due
to
the
milk
lactose
very
enjoyable
and
worthy
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
milk
stout
and
the
added
coffee
worked
well
with
this
beer
since
it
didnt
completely
dominate
it
and
it
kept
this
beer
very
balanced
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
a
little
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
especially
around
a
nice
fall
bonfire
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
the
coffee
was
a
part
of
this
beer
but
it
didnt
take
it
over
and
i
thought
the
appearance
was
very
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
think
its
worthy
of
getting
a
six
pack
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
like
milk
stouts
its
pretty
true
to
style
it
just
has
a
little
twist
from
the
coffee
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
starting
to
get
a
little
frustrated
with
stone
since
i
havent
really
been
into
there
last
few
releases
besides
that
quad
but
this
beer
turned
out
to
pretty
good
and
it
reminded
me
that
stone
can
also
make
a
tasty
low
abv
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
stone
recently
and
i
this
its
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
that
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
for
the
low
abv
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
i
am
not
sure
people
are
rating
this
relative
to
the
style
and
low
abv
but
i
thought
it
was
decent
and
not
as
bad
as
most
make
it
seem
glass
stout
glass
final
score
3
56
o
a
very
topnotch
stout
this
first
session
stout
that
ive
really
enjoyed
o
if
youre
into
coffee
this
beer
will
be
perfect
for
you
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
abv
and
extremely
coffee
and
roast
forward
could
easily
be
a
morning
beer
with
those
characteristics
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
overall
not
bad
but
pretty
under
whelming
not
much
coffee
overall
its
a
lot
less
stout
than
i
was
expecting
coffee
for
sure
but
milk
and
stout
no
so
much
final
thoughts
a
nice
offering
from
stone
are
there
better
coffee
milk
stouts
out
there
of
relatively
low
avb
sure
but
theres
plenty
of
room
for
competition
would
i
drink
it
again
yeah
the
name
promises
lots
of
flavor
what
you
get
is
a
thin
body
soso
stout
easy
to
dink
at
4
2
abv
but
you
keep
waiting
for
the
coffee
to
show
up
its
in
there
but
quite
faint
pours
dark
with
a
finger
of
brown
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
overall
not
worth
picking
up
again
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
not
sure
of
the
hate
they
tried
something
new
and
even
if
wasnt
loaded
with
flavor
or
not
as
sessionable
it
should
be
at
least
honored
as
being
one
of
the
few
english
milk
stouts
on
the
market
try
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
small
beige
head
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
close
to
rings
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
black
coffee
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
pretty
much
for
the
taste
as
well
great
flavor
with
the
perfect
balance
of
the
above
mentioned
flavors
with
a
light
hint
of
smoke
but
just
a
bit
which
added
to
this
brew
in
my
opinion
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
good
tasting
brew
one
for
the
best
i
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
medium
bodied
and
perfect
carbonation
a
really
good
brew
aroma
is
milky
coffee
and
creamy
look
is
deep
chocolate
brown
and
refuses
to
let
light
through
taste
is
smooth
and
silky
and
yet
allows
the
slightly
charred
coffee
beans
taste
come
through
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffe
throughout
with
a
back
of
milk
overall
despite
how
notbad
things
sound
above
both
vdubb
and
i
agree
that
this
beer
just
falls
very
flat
for
us
due
to
the
pedigree
of
the
brewer
makers
of
the
inimitable
stone
ris
or
irs
whichever
and
the
tasty
sound
of
the
constituent
flavors
this
should
have
been
a
slam
dunk
instead
theres
definitely
some
coffee
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
milk
stout
base
really
more
of
a
standard
or
even
an
english
stout
base
and
a
thinnerthaneverexpected
body
all
combining
with
some
hefty
initial
interest
and
hope
to
produce
a
massive
disappointment
again
i
must
state
that
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
i
drank
half
the
sixer
with
no
real
qualms
about
flavor
or
anything
like
that
but
it
reeks
of
disappointment
and
malaise
something
ive
unfortunately
experienced
a
lot
of
from
stone
recently
despite
not
being
bad
im
not
likely
to
ever
have
another
of
these
especially
at
that
higherthanmost
price
point
to
sum
things
up
this
stuff
is
okay
but
somehow
still
finds
a
way
to
be
mediocrity
incarnate
overall
i
picked
up
a
single
and
man
am
i
happy
i
made
that
choice
this
one
is
a
pass
they
need
to
work
on
this
one
stone
has
the
ability
to
do
much
better
and
they
have
this
looks
better
and
has
a
more
full
mouthfeel
than
expected
however
the
flavor
and
nose
are
rather
lacking
bitter
coffee
notes
with
slight
lactose
o
roadty
but
not
overpowering
o
a
decent
milk
stout
that
focuses
on
a
smooth
roastcoffee
bitterness
and
displays
that
flavor
profile
with
clean
simple
effectiveness
the
pleasant
coffeecream
overtones
make
this
stout
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
offers
up
a
very
sessionable
brew
worth
a
try
i
think
this
gets
the
job
done
if
youre
looking
for
an
easydrinking
stout
with
straightforward
coffee
notes
but
without
any
excess
sweetness
if
however
you
were
expecting
an
overthetop
complex
stout
in
the
same
vein
as
say
a
stones
irs
with
only
the
abv
dialed
way
down
then
youll
want
to
look
elsewhere
o
enjoyable
pleasantly
bittersweet
well
balanced
sweetnessbitterness
still
too
thick
to
feel
truly
sessionable
2014

how
light
of
a
stout
this
is
it
still
maintains
the
roasted
flavors
and
the
hints

the
lactose
come
through
as
well
the
linger
is
what
i
would
expect
with

where
the

this
is
a

id
label
it
a
coffee
stout
and
not
a
milk
stout
there
is
none
of
the
sweetness
id
expect
on
a
milk
stout
the
primary
notes
are
coffee
and
chocolate
but
there
is
something
in
there
that
the
closest
i
can
describe
is
a

not
really
my

but
it
is

i
have

that
i

this

not

better
showing
than

man
what
a
perfectly
brewed
beer
kudos
to
the
brewers
feel
fits
the
profile
for
a
stout
fullbodied
heavy
and
a
little
oily
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
this
5
all
across
was
that
i
had
already
been
drinking
before
i
tried
it
and
maybe
my
senses
were
skewed
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
very
balanced
and
complex
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
would
do
bad
things
to
try
this
again
this
is
a
wonderful
mocha
stout
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
spices
makes
your
mouth
water
the
flavor
was
even
better
than
the
aroma
the
taste
of
deeply
roasted
malts
and
a
combination
of
coca
spices
and
the
balance
of
sweetness
and
tart
put
a
wonderful
spin
on
the
mocha
stout
im
on
my
way
out
to
buy
more
before
they
run
out
sat
on
it
a
little
too
long
perhaps
but
still
very
good
beautiful
blackbrown
color
with
excellent
mouthfeel
taste
subtle
hints
of
smoke
coffee
chocolate
spices
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
hoping
the
brew
again
drinkability
a
very
interesting
and
unusual
stout
that
i
enjoyed
from
bottle
to
cold
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
creamy
head
complex
aromas
of
chocolate
spices
and
coffee
feels
much
lighter
than
many
other
stouts
the
flavors
are
diverse
with
the
most
noticeable
being
the
slightly
bitter
coffee
rounded
out
by
the
sweat
and
creamy
chocolate
notes
of
spices
remind
me
of
drinking
mexican
hot
chocolate
overall
a
fantastic
beer
with
lots
of
flavors
that
balance
beautifully
one
of
stones
best
very
impressed
with
this
beers
cooperation
ingenious
blend
of
chocolate
and
spices
that
creates
a
wellbalanced
taste
if
you
like
this
you
might
want
to
also
check
out
clown
shoes
chocolate
sombrero
o
tasty
and
very
complex
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
want
something
different
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
expecting
a
normal
mocha
stout
not
a
mocha
stout
with
mexican
chocolate
this
is
a
lot
better
knowing
what
to
expect
going
in
poured
from
22
oz
into
snifter
quite
a
nice
find
for
my
little
western
pa
bottle
shop
midnight
black
with
little
to
no
head
some
slick
transient
lacing
a
beauty
lots
of
peppergreen
pepper
on
the
nose
with
some
nice
cinnamon
nutmeg
coffee
dark
chocolate
cocoa
ridiculous
if
they
said
it
was
there
it
was
the
spices
were
prominent
in
the
taste
an
overarching
pepper
note
sans
heat
and
some
nice
chocolate
velvety
mouthfeel
with
some
of
those
lovely
lingering
spices
delicious
the
reason
that
i
love
craft
and
a
terrific
homebrew
inspiration
a
little
light
but
very
nice
coffee
notes
a
lot
of
great
coffe
stouts
out
there
and
this
is
a
damn
good
one
for
sure
dark
brown
body
2
finger
head
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
peppers
and
cinnamon
leaps
out
flavor
has
peppers
with
even
bit
of
heat
and
lots
of
cocoa
body
is
thin
though
and
affects
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
i
still
enjoyed
this
made
for
a
perfect
christmas
eve
had
it
with
some
tres
leches
cake
and
let
me
tell
you
that
was
the
best
beer
pairing
with
food
ever
get
one
if
they
arent
all
gone
best
beer
of
2014
and
its
a
collaboration
first
beer
with
peppers
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
spicy
and
that
the
peppers
added
flavor
little
thin
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
expected
nose
was
full
of
peppers
but
not
spicy
or
overwhelming
smooth
finish
as
well
overall
a
world
class
chocolate
stout
mouthfeel
is
slick
a
little
buttery
overall
pretty
good
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
loose
18th
inch
khakicolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
broken
sudsy
skim
some
small
spots
and
swaths
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
cocoa
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
just
a
hint
of
chili
pepper
taste
follows
nose
with
a
hint
of
oxidation
and
more
bakers
chocolate
than
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
assertive
carbonation
that
coupled
with
the
chili
peppers
leaves
a
mild
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
understand
the
hype
on
this
one
pours
dark
with
a
very
small
head
smell
has
lots
going
on
i
get
some
dark
fruits
sweet
chocolate
maybe
some
cinnamon
taste
is
pretty
complex
it
leans
towards
sweetness
you
can
pick
up
the
chili
without
being
spicy
also
the
cinnamon
lots
going
on
here
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
o
a
pleasent
experience
for
an
ipa
fan
this
stout
would
be
purchased
again
if
seen
it
has
been
over
a
month
since
i
tried
this
beer
yet
i
still
find
myself
thinking
about
it
regularly
creepy
right
this
beer
was
such
a
pleasant
surprise
the
combination
of
ingredients
made
this
a
truly
specialoneofakind
experience
i
really
hope
they
release
this
again
the
cinnamon
gave
it
a
nice
sweetness
while
the
peppers
balanced
that
with
a
nice
level
of
heat
very
well
made
o
personally
i
dislike
sweet
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
beer
this
one
is
exactly
that
my
wife
loved
it
and
she
hates
beer
so
yeah
lots
of
warm
cinnamon
and
chocolate
mocha
pretty
sweet
but
still
has
a
nice
edge
very
easy
comfortable
stout
very
pleasant
balance
of
bittersweet
chocolate
stout
coffee
and
green
chilies
nice
aroma
of
chili
as
well
noted
as
a
milk
stout
but
i
found
the
usual
sweetness
of
such
to
be
lacking
the
taste
is
like
a
mexican
mocha
lots
of
chocolate
not
to
bitter
warmth
and
sweetness
from
the
spices
i
hope
they
bring
this
beer
back
it
is
my
favorite
stone
beer
i
found
a
stash
of
this
in
morro
bay
and
bought
all
the
bottles
they
had
as
it
is
impossible
to
find
this
in
san
diego
if
you
find
it
buy
it
drink
it
then
trade
some
bottles
and
save
it
it
is
a
powerful
beer
currency
a
crazystrong
smelling
beer
with
loads
of
spices
and
sweetness
cookie
doughesque
loved
the
cinnamon
kick
to
this
one
i
wonder
what
this
on
nitro
would
taste
like
dark
black
in
color
with
only
the
faintest
hint
of
light
seeping
partially
through
a
fingernail
of
dark
brown
covers
the
rim
and
about
two
thirds
of
the
top
dazzling
aroma
of
coffeechili
peppersand
chocolate
the
flavor
is
packed
with
coffeechocolatecinnamonand
just
a
hint
of
chili
and
vanilla
prior
to
the
fade
the
mouth
is
a
bit
oily
and
chewy
with
a
faint
bit
of
heat
at
the
back
of
the
palate
this
beer
is
a
great
idea
but
needs
some
fine
tuning
would
buy
again
due
to
the
relative
cheapness
of
a
bomber
but
its
not
world
class
for
me
well
worth
experiencing
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
delightful
beer
somuchcinnamon
this
is
true
across
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavoring
where
it
meets
as
it
does
so
well
with
a
white
sugar
sweetness
this
makes
the
beer
very
very
cinnamonsugar
otherwise
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
outstanding
each
advertised
flavor
is
so
perfectly
represented
with
nothing
seeming
to
cheap
out
and
nothing
seeming
synthetic
or
false
all
of
this
makes
the
beer
disappear
so
quickly
in
the
parts
where
we
purchased
this
there
was
a
widespread
onebottle
minimum
so
we
had
to
split
our
efforts
we
ended
up
getting
only
one
bottle
on
that
first
day
of
the
release
here
locally
but
as
soon
as
we
could
picked
up
a
second
once
that
wave
came
through
now
after
tasting
it
we
are
infinitely
glad
we
did
but
simultaneously
kind
of
sad
that
we
didnt
get
any
other
bottles
alas
oh
well
but
perhaps
stone
will
rerelease
this
one
as
an
ultraanniversary
beer
and
it
will
once
again
humble
us
in
its
presence
was
mot
doing
it
for
me
nose
was
dirty
i
had
higher
hopes
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
but
stone
never
really
disappoints
very
tasty
mocha
coffee
flavor
o
5
a
oneofakind
unique
stout
experience
i
wish
so
bad
this
could
be
aged
as
i
would
love
to
stock
up
on
this
i
could
drink
this
stout
just
about
every
single
day
and
never
tire
of
it
been
sipping
my
glass
for
an
hour
now
as
well
as
while
i
write
this
review
dreading
finishing
this
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
porters
or
stouts
this
will
be
an
adventurous
tasty
and
unique
change
of
pace
to
the
style
absolutely
phenomenal
a
good
fill
in
for
better
beers
but
never
really
replaces
them
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
were
just
too
much
for
me
this
is
solid
stout
and
i
certainly
appreciate
trying
something
different
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
o
tasty
it
grows
on
you
a
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
thoroughly
it
seemed
all
the
flavors
worked
well
together
delicious
combination
of
spices
and
chocolate
complex
flavor
that
leaves
you
needing
more
if
only
to
discern
each
layer
attempts
to
imitate
mexican
hot
chocolate
are
almost
spot
on
a
great
winter
treat
right
on
the
mark
this
beer
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
with
moderate
carbonation
has
a
cocoa
and
peppers
aftertaste
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
overall
decent
brew
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
based
on
the
description
this
beer
was
a
cinnamony
mess
of
a
stout
pours
a
deep
black
with
tons
of
sandytan
head
that
held
pretty
well
and
faded
into
decent
lacing
good
wisps
and
a
medium
collar
aroma
is
chocolatey
a
grainy
medium
malt
lots
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
a
hint
of
indistinct
earthy
spice
pepperschilis
taste
is
bitter
coffee
up
front
nutmeg
and
vanilla
playing
well
together
and
a
malty
sweetness
nice
warmth
from
the
peppers
kinda
high
carbonation
for
a
stout
and
definitely
thin
in
the
body
good
beer
but
lacks
in
too
many
ways
to
be
great
honestly
there
is
no
shortage
of
praise
that
can
and
should
be
rained
down
on
all
parties
responsible
for
this
exceptional
and
so
far
as
im
concerned
unparallelled
stout
the
level
of
flavour
and
drinkability
achieved
is
indeed
deityworthy
i
can
only
pray
stone
has
the
good
sense
to
make
this
one
a
regular
or
at
least
seasonal
release
truly
unbelievable
stuff
overall
theres
a
lot
of
favors
and
aroma
going
on
and
the
brewer
has
done
an
amazing
job
of
balancing
all
the
flavors
ultimately
i
really
didnt
like
the
pepper
so
i
wont
drink
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
if
you
like
pepper
flavor
in
your
beer
you
will
probably
like
this
similar
in
style
to
prairie
bomb
less
spicy
tasty
brew
perfect
unique
like
no
other
overall
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
i
am
not
a
fan
of
stone
i
think
they
overhop
everything
but
i
can
honestly
say
without
reservation
that
they
have
produced
one
of
the
most
magnificent
beers
i
have
ever
drank
if
you
can
find
it
anymore
you
need
to
buy
it
and
drink
it
regardless
of
price
its
that
good
a
total
gamechanger
i
would
highly
recommend
they
run
it
as
a
seasonal
beer
or
even
a
production
beer
i
actually
taste
every
element
they
say
is
in
the
beer
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
amazingly
well
balanced
beer
my
only
negative
would
be
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
d
this
was
a
nice
spiced
stout
the
scent
made
me
think
it
would
be
really
hot
but
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
the
body
was
good
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
stone
collaborations
tons
of
vanilla
and
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
smell
and
taste
pepper
is
noticable
in
my
esophagus
long
after
swallowing
would
be
perfect
if
the
coffee
stood
out
a
little
more
and
had
a
fuller
body
and
a
creamier
mouthfeel
this
bottle
is
4
months
old
so
the
coffee
may
have
faded
slightly
excellent
beer
overall
good
head
leaves
a
moderate
lace
nose
is
coffee
with
vanilla
and
cinnamon
notes
slight
cherry
finish
has
a
slight
pepper
bite
but
cinnamon
lingers
nice
color
nice
nose
creamy
malt
and
stout
just
too
much
other
craziness
going
on
for
my
tastes
it
does
balance
out
surprisingly
but
the
cinammon
with
the
spice
with
the
vanilla
is
just
a
lot
to
cope
with
i
want
it
to
be
a
little
less
biting
cheers
o
an
awesome
coffee
stout
get
it
if
you
can
well
done
pretty
good
not
a
good
as
bomb
or
mexican
cake
but
for
price
pretty
nice
i
feel
like
i
got
the
session
coffee
milk
stout
in
my
bomber
instead
of
what
everybody
is
raving
about
all
i
got
was
lactose
and
weak
coffee
let
it
warm
to
room
temp
as
i
tasted
it
and
still
didnt
get
anything
on
paper
this
was
a
winner
great
flavor
complexity
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
more
often
in
nc
great
beer
excellent
mouth
feel
love
the
cinnamon
and
while
not
a
huge
fan
of
peppers
in
beer
it
absolutely
works
in
this
excellent
offering
from
stone
o
ive
been
looking
forward
to
cracking
this
one
and
it
didnt
disappoint
fantastic
brew
sweet
solid
but
nothing
i
got
particularly
excited
by
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
but
that
is
about
it
really
one
of
the
nicest
beers
ive
ever
had
more
of
this
needs
to
be
brewed
a
little
sweet
a
little
spicy
a
little
heat
rich
mouthfeel
while
being
extremely
drinkable
overall
kudos
to
chris
banker
for
coming
up
with
this
innovative
recipe
the
flavor
layering
cant
get
much
better
than
this
cheers
to
chris
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
did
not
get
any
of
the
heat
from
the
peppers
all
i
got
was
the
sweet
spices
that
were
in
the
beer
o
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
great
flavors
and
fantastic
complexity
stone
makes
some
great
beers
and
this
one
is
worthy
of
the
origin
pours
a
four
finger
light
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
black
color
mahogany
highlights
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
coffee
chocolate
and
pepper
nose
flavor
is
same
chocolate
with
chile
pepper
and
baked
chocolate
pricey
at
8
49
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
big
deal
irving
spofford
nh
mouthfeel
is
really
good
nice
heavy
medium
feel
yet
a
long
lingering
flavor
well
carbonated
without
being
too
strong
a
real
flavor
explosion
going
on
here
but
with
such
a
strong
flavor
it
maintains
some
smoothness
while
going
to
a
dry
earthiness
then
ends
with
a
dry
finish
then
some
heat
lingering
afterwards
from
the
peppers
nice
drinkable
beer
at
8
1
and
all
that
flavor
its
still
really
a
beer
any
stout
lover
could
handle
easily
another
great
stone
collaboration
if
this
were
brewed
again
id
definitely
get
it
a
rare
treat
pours
pretty
black
some
caramel
highlights
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
is
short
but
nicely
creamy
dropping
to
a
bubbly
band
and
patchy
film
big
deep
spicy
aromas
waft

of
the
glass
cocoa
vanilla
bean
cinnamon
nutmeg
dark

pretty
much
exactly
as
advertised
and
well
executed
flavor
opens
with
a
smooth
blend
of
dark
cocoa
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
followed
by
vanilla
and
a
pleasant
fruitiness
not
particularly
spicy
but
the
chili
flavor
is
there
in
a
supporting
role
this
beer
is
really
more
about
the
spices
and
malty
mocha
flavors
than
the
heat
chocolate
pudding
whipped
cream
and
berries
mediumfull
bodied
and
sort
of
fluffy
drying
out
completely
and
not
allowing
it
to
get
too
sweet
nicely
done
m
extra
smooth
melted
chocolate
and
not
too
sticky
soft
almost
heavy
and
in
general
whipped
up
overall
i
am
really
loving
this
beer
beers
like
this
can
so
easily
go
awry
but
here
the
balance
is
wonderful
and
the
flavors
just
really
grab
me
bottle
from
trade
and
shared
with
the
wife
pours
dark
brown
from
the
bottle
and
settles
nearly
black
in
the
glass
with
a
two
finger
khaki
brown
head
honestly
looked
on
the
thin
side
as
it
poured
aroma
is
big
on
the
chili
peppers
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
in
the
background
dont
get
a
lot
of
roast
or
sweetness
in
the
nose
though
flavor
is
a
different
story
with
lots
of
cinnamon
and
chocolate
kick
of
peppers
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
lingering
nutmeg
too
much
vegetal
pepper
and
some
metallic
notes
not
spicy
really
just
vegetal
flavored
medium
plus
bodied
smooth
with
medium
plus
carbonation
as
expected
from
the
look
this
is
on
the
thinner
side
for
the
style
needs
that
big
sweet
depth
to
stand
up
to
the
spices
but
is
lacking
that
overall
this
isnt
a
poor
beer
but
its
pretty
disappointing
after
having
mexican
cake
hunahpu
abraxas
bomb
and
barrel
aged
variants
of
all
of
those
this
one
really
isnt
close
overall
i
liked
this
a
lot
i
thought
it
has
an
amazing
nose
with
a
ton
going
on
the
taste
is
lighter
and
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
and
i
wish
the
body
was
a
bit
thicker
but
it
is
very
good
worth
buying
for
sure
glad
to
see
this
sitting
on
the
shelf
do
you
really
need
3
different
peoplebrewers
to
create
this
this
stuff
is
horrible
way
too
much
pepper
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
low
b
good
strong
coffee
taste
but
could
use
some
creamer
for
my
taste
it
was
too
bitter
for
a
finish
o
this
fulfilled
its
role
as
a
chile
stout
without
wielding
the
chiles
like
a
club
would
repeat
yes
this
was
strong
but
the
alcohol
could
only
be
felt
and
not
tasted
the
transition
from
fall
into
winter
involves
the
marzens
and
pumpkin
ales
giving
way
to
stouts
and
porters
and
if
any
beer
could
bridge
that
divide
this
would
certainly
be
it
the
spice
reminded
me
of
a
pumpkin
ale
without
the
burn
while
the
body
of
this
beer
was
clearly
a
milksweet
stout
that
wasnt
jacked
up
on
lactose
and
sugar
if
you
love
beer
get
this
its
not
the
best
stout
out
there
and
probably
the
best
seasonal
currently
on
the
shelf
but
its
damn
close
to
being
either
of
those
and
the
most
unique
brew
that
you
could
grab
before
the
winter
firmly
sets
in
a
wonderful
mesh
of
flavors
could
be
found
here
as
this
easily
deserves
to
be
added
to
stones
fulltime
rotation
a
subtly
fabulous
brew
that
pushes
the
boundary
of
whats
possible
while
tasting
as
familiar
as
the
recurring
seasonals
that
dont
quite
measure
up
to
this
incredible
very
surprised
by
this
one
amazing
taste
and
great
mouth
feel
i
didnt
like
mexican
cake
but
this
really
takes
it
a
bit
thinner
and
bubblier
than
expected
definitely
better
flavor
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
too
much
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
for
my
taste
eric
the
spice
was
weak
for
me
just
a
whiff
of
nutmeg
in
the
aroma
and
a
splash
of
generic
spice
in
the
taste
i
didnt
really
catch
the
cinnamon
still
it
was
a
very
good
beer
not
too
dry
not
too
bitter
well
round
and
full
of
flavor
heres
a
stout
for
the
sweet
tooth
one
that
can
appeal
to
beer
geeks
and
casual
beer
drinkers
the
beer
smells
like
a
spiced
chocolate
dessert
and
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
note
of
coffee
chocolate
and
cinnamon
a
sliver
of
a
rubbing
alcohol
note
remains
the
only
fatal
flaw
that
this
beer
delivers
otherwise
forget
about
going
to
coldstone
and
open
a
bottle
of
xocoveza
dark
brown
thin
head
maintains
with
moderate
lacing
down
the
glass
cinnamon
overwhelms
the
scent
hint
of
herbal
green
pepper
but
the
cinnamon
makes
the
smell
a
little
unpleasant
cinnamon
carries
through
in
the
taste
though
chocolate
and
smokey
chile
nicely
round
out
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
smooth
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
flavors
from
becoming
muddled
interesting
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
probably
not
something
where
ill
crave
another
though
alright
so
i
lost
a
lot
of
interest
in
stouts
lately
unless
its
barrel
aged
ill
usually
avoid
it
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
one
its
complex
sweet
bitter
and
everything
in
between
this
beer
is
extremely
wellmade
and
id
definitely
have
another
very
good
perfect
mexican
hot
chocolate
in
beer
form
strives
to
do
something
very
specific
and
does
it
perfectly
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
one
of
these
if
you
see
it
or
two
or
three
overall
very
tasty
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
onetime
brew
o
very
very
complex
beer
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
thicker
of
a
bodyless
carbonation
but
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
stone
has
ever
made
o
excellent
twist
on
a
milk
stout
tons
going
on
here
with
spices
and
coffee
and
pepper
flavorful
without
overwhelming
pepper
warmth
without
getting
spicy
interesting
fruit
and
cola
undertones
too
sweet
and
earthy
with
quite
the
bitter
finish
gentle
carbonation
yeah
im
sure
a
bigger
body
wouldnt
hurt
but
damn
this
is
good
as
is
meh
definitely
well
crafted
and
unique
but
i
dont
see
all
the
hype
i
love
this
beer
all
caps
love
overall
this
is
a
magnificent
collaboration
beer
from
stone
cervezeria
insurgente
and
chris
banker
a
tip
of
the
cap
to
stone
for
spotlighting
a
homebrewers
recipe
this
is
a
great
brew
and
unlike
other
spiced
stouts
and
porters
ive
had
very
cool
o
4
25
stone
has
done
an
excellent
job
here
there
are
a
lot
of
really
good
flavors
going
on
and
despite
not
being
the
most
balanced
beer
it
seems
to
work
well
also
the
addition
of
lactose
makes
this
an
interesting
variation
in
the
world
of
stouts
with
coffee
spices
etc
there
was
just
something
really
wrong
with
this
beer
something
tastes
off
to
me
like
medicine
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
my
class
had
soap
or
something
in
it
but
i
cant
imagine
this
is
the
same
beer
everyone
else
has
been
raving
over
could
it
all
be
hype
great
layers
of
spice
malts
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
like
you
just
stuck
a
small
amount
of
nutmeg
and
cocoa
powder
in
your
mouth
and
washed
it
down
with
a
chile
stout
ogreat
flavors
in
this
stout
really
enjoyed
it
overall
what
a
great
complex
beer
so
much
going
on
and
somehow
it
all
works
wonderfully
one
of
the
beer
beers
stone
has
produced
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
solid
two
finger
frothy
tan
head
that
shows
great
retention
aromas
of
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
dominate
with
the
spicy
peppers
poking
through
a
bit
especially
as
this
warms
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
subtle
but
again
poke
out
a
bit
more
as
my
sample
warms
great
aroma
rich
chocolate
and
vanilla
hit
my
palette
in
spades
coffee
and
pepper
sweep
in
to
cleanse
the
sweet
maltiness
milk
chocolate
with
spices
linger
with
a
sweetness
long
after
the
end
of
every
sip
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
silky
velvety
mouthfeel
damn
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
creamy
rich
flavorful
brew
so
glad
i
was
able
to
find
some
of
this
a
well
done
stout
the
peppers
and
spices
are
a
very
tasty
addition
i
dont
know
what
a
mexican
hot
chocolate
tastes
or
smells
like
so
while
i
respect
the
brewing
expertise
and
clever
ingenuity
used
to
make
this
beer
i
sadly
must
admit
that
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
it
was
good
but
not
my
thing
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
close
to
oddsides
mayan
mocha
stout
and
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
crisp
slightly
creamy
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
very
good
and
to
me
it
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
higher
level
of
bitterness
i
wouldnt
mind
less
bitterness
with
just
a
little
more
sweetness
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
spiced
stouts
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
just
a
little
impressed
stone
can
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
one
was
pretty
close
to
being
a
hit
its
not
my
favorite
stone
beer
and
its
up
there
with
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
good
and
creative
work
an
enjoyable
stout
and
one
where
the
added
flavours
dont
overwhelm
the
beer
i
would
happily
endure
in
this
beer
again
though
ill
admit
i
may
soon
forget
it
as
memorable
pours
a
dark
blackish
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
and
chocolatey
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
cocoa
and
coffee
notes
giving
away
to
a
spicy
cinnamon
aftertaste
reminding
me
of
cinnamon
mocha
coffee
alcohol
is
well
disguised
by
all
the
flavors
full
bodied
well
carbonated
ale
that
is
a
bit
chewy
overall
this
is
a
unique
fresh
take
on
a
coffee
stout
i
can
recommend
this
this
one
sold
out
quick
and
you
are
bummed
if
you
missed
out
quite
impressive
given
the
ingredients
and
great
in
its
own
right
o
this
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
the
flavors
really
do
well
to
mimic
mexican
hot
chocolate
very
rich
and
definetly
worth
trying
on
tap
at
trumbull
kitchen
in
hartford
absolutely
delicious
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
taste
and
nose
of
cinnamon
coffee
chocolate
and
nutmeg
just
a
brilliant
beer
this
is
an
assertive
stout
with
notes
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
and
a
noticeable
bite
on
the
back
end
from
the
chiles
i
love
spicy
food
and
hoppy
beers
and
this
stout
really
hit
the
sweet
spot
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
smooth
milk
stout
youre
really
not
going
to
like
this
one
but
i
thought
it
was
fantastic
overall
a
fantastic
beer
if
im
able
to
locate
a
second
bottle
id
love
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
over
a
year
or
two
overall
although
the
aroma
is
a
bit
rough
and
assertive
the
adjuncts
blend
nicely
in
the
flavor
profile
one
of
the
better
collaboration
beers
i
have
tasted
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
stout
i
wish
there
was
more
sweetness
in
the
end
it
stands
out
and
is
worth
trying
out
taste
nutmeg
cinnamon
ginger
bread
a
touch
of
mint
sage
at
the
end
beautiful
pepper
and
alcohol
hotness
lingers
on
the
palate
poured
from
bomber
into
glasses
and
shared
with
a
friend
a
black
beer
with
minimal
tan
head
looks
like
a
pretty
typical
stout
aroma
is
of
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
some
pepper
this
was
my
first
spiced
stout
so
to
me
the
taste
was
really
unique
very
much
like
a
mexican
chocolate
milk
chocolate
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
with
the
added
complexity
of
vanilla
and
peppers
nothing
over
the
top
this
has
very
well
balanced
flavors
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
not
super
heavy
or
syrupy
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
need
to
be
sipped
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
kudos
to
chris
banker
and
stone
on
this
one
chocolate
coffee
and
pepper
forward
dry
not
sweet
very
nice
o
exceptionally
integrated
flavors
and
smooth
execution
no
one
character
stands
out
this
drinks
incredibly
well
and
does
taste
similar
to
mexicanhot
chocolate
dry
unsweetened
cocoa
taste
up
front
theres
a
touch
of
mint
too
chewy
body
low
carbonation
theres
also
a
spiciness
to
this
beeralmost
like
hot
sauce
overall
a
very
good
beer
great
mix
of
flavors
you
get
a
taste
of
everything
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
few
to
be
able
to
enjoy

not

overall
a
quality
spiced
stout
thats
widely
available
yes
please
o
id
think
with
stones
capacity
that
they
could
make
this
a
rotating
beer
it
really
delivers
and
fills
a
void
for
all
the
htf
beers
in
this
style
it
much
more
than
just
holds
a
candle
to
the
top
five
rated
beers
it
actually
fared
finer
than
one
said
beer
ive
tried
in
the
top
five
excellent
beer
with
great
flavors
try
it
cold
and
let
it
warm
tasting
it
every
so
often
flavor
profile
changes
greatly
but
always
good
cinnamon
and
vanilla
on
the
cold
side
chocolate
in
the
mid
temp
range
and
coffee
on
the
warmer
side
excellent
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
certainly
hangs
up
there
with
other
stouts
that
use
similar
ingredients
that
ive
had
and
the
price
point
far
surpasses
any
other
comps
just
when
i
thought
stone
was
only
producing
dumpers
as
of
late
they
go
and
do
thisand
totally
redeem
themselves
stone
has
typically
let
me
down
not
living
up
to
their
reputation
but
i
liked
this
one
very
much
personally
my
favorite
stone
beer
very
interesting
mix
of
flavors
the
flavors
all
complemented
each
other
well
o
well
done
stone
the
balance
is
just
stunning
to
me
overall
very
nice
quite
tasty
with
a
nice
spice
character
that
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
and
actually
blends
nicely
with
the
other
flavors
vanilla
cocoa
coffee
and
dark
malts
all
blend
nicely
as
well
as
the
cinnamon
pepper
and
mild
nutmeg
all
come
together
nicely
and
even
blend
well
with
the
other
flavors
booze
is
hidden
fairly
well
behind
the
flavors
and
heat
from
the
pepper
and
cinnamon
quite
enjoyable
verdict
a
definite
success
from
stone
banker
and
insurgente
i
just
really
wish
that
the
body
was
richer
and
silkier
less
carbonation
and
a
bigger
feel
would
take
this
beer
a
long
way
the
balance
of
flavors
and
the
showcase
of
the
adjuncts
is
great
quite
a
bit
of
depth
as
well
i
love
how
the
spices
are
the
forefront
rather
than
the
pepper
but
it
just
needs
that
extra
bit
of
body
to
carry
it
to
true
greatness
overall
a
very
good
spiced
up
take
on
an
imperial
stout
the
spices
add
a
nice
kick
without
overwhelming
the
rich
dark
malt
notes
they
really
nailed
it
here
wow
dark
pour
not
to
thick
the
coffee
mocha
and
peppers
come
through
and
all
work
vey
well
together
im
sorry
i
only
bought
one
bottle
if
this
were
a
bit
thicker
in
the
hips
it
would
reach
the
top
tier
but
as
is
no
complaints
from
me

and
very

for
the

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
beer
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
try
westbrooks
mexican
cake
but
am
really
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
beer
delicious
and
i
dont
see
how
you
could
do
the
style
much
better
o
not
as
good
as
everyone
is
saying
it
is
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
there
isnt
a
lot
of
complexity
on
the
nose
and
palate
and
its
a
bit
too
thin
to
boot
3
75
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
i
doubt
if
i
can
find
it
again
but
i
will
seek
it
out
o
the
mexican
hot
chocolate
concept
has
been
done
a
few
times
by
now
but
stone
and
company
really
nailed
it
down
with
this
one
balance
is
crucial
with
all
the
different
adjuncts
in
play
and
it
really
cant
be
done
any
more
perfectly
than
this
even
the
body
and
texture
mimic
the
mexican
hot
chocolate
to
a
tee
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
right
down
to
the
last
drop
overall
hmm
not
much
a
fan
the
flavors
werent
really
as
cohesive
as
i
wouldve
liked
too
much
bitter
astringent
coffee
character
causing
too
much
unbalance
its
getting
rave
reviews
here
but
its
got
me
scratching
my
head
not
my
cup
o
tea
i
suppose
very
dark
brown
with
tan
head
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
early
on
with
chocolate
mixed
in
and
chilies
warm
at
the
end
as
the
beer
warms
vanilla
becomes
more
present
and
all
the
flavors
mix
very
well
the
beer
is
slightly
boozy
but
not
overly
sweet
very
good
beer
i
imagine
this
would
be
great
on
a
snowy
day
this
beer
had
impeccable
style
and
balance
the
biscuit
sweet
light
and
dry
combined
perfectly
with
the
chocolate
and
they
could
not
be
separated
in
the
tasting
then
the
coffee
added
a
something
almost
smoothing
to
the
flavor
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
also
combined
perfectly
so
that
they
could
not
be
separated
in
the
tasting
the
pepper
did
not
detract
or
seem
too
loud
too
hot
or
too
bold
but
it
was
colorful
i
found
that
the
flavors
in
this
beer
reminded
me
of
festive
colors
and
i
thought
that
was
whimsical
because
the
beer
is
pitch
black
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
stone
collaboration
beer
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
spot
on
the
description
and
was
a
joy
to
drink
glad
i
grabbed
an
extra
one
that
one
will
be
all
mine
xocoveza
is
a
delicious
beer
thats
actually
quite
reasonably
priced
in
a
craft
beer
world
full
of
excessively
priced
bombers
this
reminds
me
after
the
debacle
that
was
their
coffee
vanilla
stout
or
whatever
its
called
that
stone
bottles
some
of
the
best
beer
out
there
whats
amazing
about
xocoveza
is
that
you
can
taste
all
of
the
flavors
individually
youll
get
the
cinnamon
chocolate
and
chili
up
front
but
you
get
the
roasty
sweet
stout
taste
on
the
finish
this
beer
could
have
gone
totally
wrong
but
stone
balanced
the
long
list
of
ingredients
perfectly
this
is
my
new
goto
beer
if
i
am
looking
for
something
with
added
flavors
good
flavors
although
it
gets
a
little
heavy
drinking
a
whole
glass
a
very
dark
lovely
black
stout
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
quickly
but
holds
a
small
ring
very
clear
coffee
aroma
with
spice
notes
the
taste
is
a
dinner
coffee
this
is
called
a
mocha
stout
they
mean
it
more
coffee
than
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
sweet
malts
and
spice
then
a
clear
vanilla
bean
in
the
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
which
makes
sipping
difficult
an
easy
drinker
this
could
get
dangerous
on
a
cold
night
dark
brown
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
this
is
an
exceptionally
balanced
beer
given
all
the
exotic
adjuncts
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
nicely
bitter
with
great
flavors
from
the
spices
and
coffee
stone
does
it
again
o
a
fantastic
beer
the
aromas
are
out
of
this
world
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
category
nonetheless
an
outstanding
brew
that
should
be
tried
by
all
overall
an
excellent
beer
by
stone
and
collaborators
really
loving
all
the
spices
in
the
beer
tastes
like
a
spiced
hot
chocolate
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fluffy
3
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
chocolate
coffee
and
nutmeg
are
detectable
by
the
nose
the
roasted
malt
base
has
a
layer
of
dark
chocolate
nutmeg
some
hint
of
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
coffee
on
top
of
it
some
pepper
arrives
late
in
the
taste
moderate
bitterness
herer
too
easy
to
drink
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
black
body
with
slight
brown
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
one
finger
tan
head
appearance
is
quite
nice
very
well
done
for
a
stout
scents
of
coffee
dark
coffee
grounds
roast
malt
cocoa
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
vegetal
spicy
pepper
aromas
up
front
cinnamon
cream
and
hints
of
vanilla
and
nutmeg
mingle
in
the
background
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
rich
coffee
stout
that
has
an
interesting
pepper
presence
from
the
chilies
and
a
nice
spiciness
from
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavor
begins
modestly
sweet
like
sweetened
coffee
with
cream
balancing
this
is
a
vegetal
chili
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
heat
not
enough
to
impart
but
the
slightest
heat
and
a
bit
of
a
dark
coffee
flavor
and
a
light
cinnamon
presence
a
bit
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
cocoa
are
discernible
in
the
background
though
not
heavily
the
middle
moves
into
a
more
dark
coffee
flavor
with
notes
of
rich
semisweet
chocolate
a
slight
pepper
that
takes
on
a
mild
burning
character
and
a
bit
of
a
cinnamon
flavor
finish
is
semisweet
with
notes
of
semisweet
chocolate
cocoa
powder
dark
coffee
grounds
coffee
with
cream
vegetal
spicy
chili
hints
of
cinnamon
a
light
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
mildly
spicy
chili
and
cinnamon
swallow
aftertaste
is
spicy
and
dark
with
notes
of
cinnamon
chili
cocoa
dark
coffee
grounds
and
roast
malt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
very
complex
milk
stout
that
has
a
variety
of
very
good
flavors
mingling
together
into
a
wonderful
cohesive
whole
that
has
the
aimedfor
character
of
traditional
hot
chocolate
it
is
rich
and
deep
spicy
yet
semisweet
and
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
creamy
feel
and
a
slight
burn
from
the
chili
and
cinnamon
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
wonderfully
rich
and
full
stout
with
a
nice
burn
from
the
added
ingredients
that
is
warming
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
very
good
experimental
stout
it
has
a
nice
milk
stout
base
that
is
aided
by
the
addition
of
chili
cinnamon
cocoa
and
coffee
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
its
mouthfeel
aids
drinkability
and
is
warming
and
nice
the
only
downside
is
the
general
lack
of
vanilla
and
especially
nutmeg
two
of
the
ingredients
in
the
aroma
and
especially
in
the
flavor
a
very
good
stout
nonetheless
and
well
worth
trying
overall
awesome
brew
your
mission
is
to
seek
and
destroy
grab
your
favorite
beer
glass
and
inhale
salud
overall
this
is
awesome
i
love
it
and
wish
i
could
have
this
all
the
time
it
would
make
an
awesome
dessert
beer
but
would
be
good
pretty
much
whenever
if
i
could
change
one
thing
i
would
try
to
make
it
a
little
less
sweet
in
the
middle
but
im
splitting
hairs
here
truly
great
m
nicely
medium
to
thick
and
coats
the
palette
well
not
overly
carbonated
quite
interesting
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
its
almost
a
west
coast
porter
in
its
bitter
strength
which
also
tends
toward
acrid
to
me
id
be
willing
to
give
this
another
chance
but
unless
i
was
totally
mistaken
in
this
tasting
that
could
be
enough
for
me
i
didnt
quite
love
this
one
after
all
the
hype
im
a
bit
disappointed
obviously
my
rating
shows
that
i
enjoyed
it
overall
but
it
was
not
worldclass
in
my
opinion
i
mostly
got
coffee
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
i
got
coffee
and
a
spicy
bit
of
heat
in
the
background
eh
the
nose
on
this
is
great
full
and
robust
and
a
clear
and
sharp
character
upon
first
whiff
you
just
hope
that
the
beer
tastes
the
same
and
yes
it
is
pretty
much
on
that
level
strong
mocha
with
all
the
spices
and
accents
hitting
just
right
a
bit
thin
but
not
so
much
that
its
detracting
great

i

like
the

theres
also
some

vegetal

flavors
the
peppers
seem
spicer
in

there
isnt
much

heat
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
at
all
maybe
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
it
to
be
spicier
with
that
being

i
still
think
its
a
pretty

a
bomber
wow
i
was
expecting
a
great
stout
but
this
exceeds
expectations
i
recommend
picking
one
up
if
you
see
it
the
spice
aroma
mixed
with
the
sweet
coffee
flavor
profile
is
awesome
stunning
simply
stunning
to
quote
my
favorite
under
appreciated
academic
this
is
so
cool
and
even
though
it
starts
a
little
weird
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
love
it
its
appearance
is
magic
muted
black
luster
milkshake
thick
grayish
brown
head
with
a
creamy
look
and
a
patient
feel
that
just
makes
me
want
it
more
the
nose
shows
way
more
chili
pepper
than
expected
and
plenty
of
coffee
too
with
the
bitter
roast
being
way
back
and
the
other
additives
just
highlighting
the
grain
bill
is
awesome
full
bodied
and
rich
but
dry
as
heck
which
means
i
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
long
flavor
journey
here
perfect
blend
of
each
component
coffee
is
earthy
peppers
flare
up
just
a
bit
vanilla
sweetens
and
unites
cocoa
goes
earthy
again
marrying
dark
malt
and
bakers
chocolate
bitterness
at
first
it
seemed
weird
but
by
the
bottom
of
the
bomber
im
sad
there
isnt
another
drop
in
there
perfect
alcohol
strength
too
cant
smell
or
taste
or
feel
it
but
right
above
8
abv
is
where
it
should
be
creamy
as
anything
in
feel
so
rich
and
smooth
but
being
dry
too
makes
it
special
one
of
the
best
takes
on
this
chili
thing
its
way
smoother
than
cigar
citys
and
even
more
well
integrated
than
perennials
something
special
here
good
on
the
homebrewer
who
thought
this
up
youre
a
legend
mate
prost
not
too
hot
good
balance
i
really
like
this
not
overtly
coffee
but
the
coffee
is
strong
but
held
in
check
thanks
to
some
sweet
malts
and
interesting
flavors
come
out
with
combonation
of
the
spiceschiles
total
dessert
beer
smells
like
a
glazed
cinnamon
bun
beautiful
mocha
flavor
with
a
touch
of
pepper
head
pairs
well
with
leftover
taco
bell
fourthmeal
o
if
youre
looking
for
a
very
traditional
milk
stout
look
elsewhere
otherwise
this
is
a
unique
well
made
and
intensely
flavorful
beer
i
just
couldnt
figure
this
one
out
it
was
different
to
me
for
sure
it
started
off
chocolate
heat
and
of
course
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
it
was
like
a
pumpkin
stout
with
no
pumpkin
the
heat
was
there
but
not
terrible
to
be
honest
i
dont
like
spicy
foods
and
this
was
fine
your
mouth
gets
used
to
it
very
quickly
and
it
dissappears
into
the
mix
quite
nicely
i
couldnt
tell
how
much
i
liked
it
and
then
i
looked
down
and
it
was
gone
it
would
be
an
occasional
sipper
not
a
daily
drinker
though
glad
i
got
to
try
and
looking
forward
to
trying
others
of
the
style
to
compare
while
i
would
not
really
categorize
this
as
a
milk
stout
it
is
definitely
not
a
double
or
imperial
either
i
suppose
that
it
is
in
its
own
category
like
many
stone
concoctions
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
stone
right
up
there
with
the
v
e
101010
belgian
stout
gonna
have
to
get
some
more
i
have
decided
that
i
just
dont
like
cinnamon
that
much
in
my
brews
really
solid
stout
by
stone
as
always
but
give
me
ris
and
i
will
be
just
as
happy
o
now
its
not
quite
as
stellar
as
mexican
cake
but
it
has
its
own
thing
going
on
which
is
indeed
fantastic
its
supposed
to
mimic
mexican
hot
chocolate
and
they
did
a
damn
fine
job
pairs
well
with
cornbread
and
chili
overall
wow
this
brew
is
an
inyourface
flavor
bomb
its
flavors
are
so
individual
yet
mingle
and
integrate
nicely
just
to
throw
a
small
gripe
out
there
id
have
liked
the
spice
notes
to
be
a
little
more
subtle
still
an
awesome
unique
brew
just
absolutely
chalk
full
of
tasty
flavor
poured
very
dark
almost
black
with
just
a
very
thin
head
aroma
was
coffee
cinnamon
slight
dark
chocolate
and
peppery
the
taste
was
big
cinnamon
coffe
and
spice
up
front
with
a
nice
sweethot
chocolate
and
pepper
bite
in
the
finish
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
thought
it
was
a
little
thin
overall
this
was
an
excellant
beer
i
read
the
label
after
my
first
smelltaste
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy
with
the
chile
smell
this
is
one
ill
return
to
while
its
available
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
brew
and
one
ill
probably
pick
up
more
of
when
im
off
island
this
week
but
not
as
life
changing
as
the
hype
made
it
out
to
be
overall
this
is
the
worst
stone
beer
ive
ever
had
and
ive
had
my
share
its
also
as
bad
a
stout
as
i
can
remember
particularly
a
mocha
stout
particularly
a
milk
stout
of
which
this
clearly
isnt
other
than
look

who

for
a
falltime
sipper
when
you
have
this
beauty
o
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
hot
pepper
beers
but
this
one
worked
for
me
would
love
this
on
a
cold
winter
evening
poured
from
bomber
bottle
while
cooler
the
chocolate
and
spices
hit
the
nose
as
it
warms
the
peppery
notes
come
out
kind
of
a
dry
silky
smooth
texture
on
the
tongue
kind
of
like
powdered
cocoa
the
coffee
strikes
me
as
subtle
the
pepper
on
the
palate
comes
out
as
it
warms
but
is
not
overwhelming
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
stands
up
to
the
hype
ive
been
hearing
thats
probably
why
i
had
to
work
so
hard
to
find
it
this
is
a
fantastic
spiced
stout
at
a
relatively
low
abv
for
the
style
if
i
were
to
nitpick
id
prefer
to
ratchet
up
the
pepper
and
down
the
cinnamon
just
a
hair
in
about
equal
proportions
certainly
a
stout
overall
damn
good
beer
i
hope
they
can
turn
this
into
a
regular
offering
down
the
road
its
too
good
to
make
it
just
the
one
time
overall
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
the
cinnamon
flavor
is
very
overwhelming
which
masks
the
stout
or
actual
beer
flavor
if
you
are
a
fan
of
cinnamon
holiday
coffees
then
this
would
probably
be
right
up
your
alley
in
fact
i
would
recommend
saving
a
bottle
for
the
winter
months
overall
i
am
running
back
to
the
store
to
buy
three
more
of
these
might
be
a
little
generous
with
the
scores
good

overall
very
nice
a
little
like
mexican
cake
i
think
a
slight
nod
to
mc
bottles
easily
the
best
new
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
i
am
pretty
sure
this
beer
is
rated
so
highly
because
it
is
near
the
top
of
most
peoples
budget
for
a
single
beer
and
for
a
810
beer
it
is
unique
overall
great
adjunct
stout
beats
out
prairie
bomb
in
my
opinion
but
not
quite
as
good
as
huna

crwnb
reminds
me
of
a
bastard

an
orgy
involving
the

to
show
you
dont
need
to
incite
a
riot
or
kiss
a
liquor
store
owners
ass
to
enjoy
a
great
beer
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
im
tasting
for
the
first
time
right
after
tasing
ten
fidy
for
the
first
time
tastes
a
little
thin
to
me
its
flavorful
but
reminds
me
of
cola
more
so
than
a
stout
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
if
it
lives
up
to
my
expectations
after
reading
all
the
reviews
ill
try
again
at
a
later
date
by
itself
for
a
more
honest
andd
fair
review
it
aint
easy
to
follow
ten
fidy
while
still
managing
to
hit
all
the
bases
at
the
same
time
two
thumbs
up
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
contributes
to
the
not
so
heavy
feel
of
the
beer
drink
it
was
tasty
and
unique
i
had
hunaphu
before
and
this
was
slightly
beneath
it
not
as
big
or
layered
i
said
it
in
untappd
and
i
will
say
it
again
barrel
aged
this
and
its
gold
delicious
one
gets
the
malt
taste
up
front
on
the
back
end
the
peppers
kick
in
complex
o
excellent
spiced
stout
maybe
i
should
have
bought
more
than
2
bottles
mexican
cake
killer
something
of
a
lightweight
version
of
mexican
cake
this
is
still
a
well
made
well
crafted
stout
from
stone
overall
4

this
might
be
one
of
stones
best
beers
to
date
im
obviously
predisposed
to
like
it
given
the
style
and
ingredients
but
i
still
think
they
have
executed
it
quite
well
theyve
managed
to
capture
my
favorite
parts
of
the
big
mexican
stouts
while
making
it
unique
enough
that
its
not
just
a
knockoff
of
other
beers
i
know
its
not
often
that
stone
decides
to
redux
a
collaboration
beer
but
im
really
hopeful
that
they
will
decide
to
produce
this
one
regularly
even
if
not
i
have
made
sure
to
stock
up
on
bottlesan
easy
thing
to
do
at
such
a
reasonable
price

wide
availability

primarily
spiced

dry
and

a

with
a
hit
of

small
bit
of
lactose
sweet
as
well
coated
very
well
nice

thick
with
just
a
bit

overall
a
surprisingly
solid
beer
a
good
milk
stout
with
a
twist
that
worked
o
this
is
good
for
the
style
i
am
glad
i
got
a
few
of
these
for
the
occasional
opening
this
winter
big
hits
of
cinnamon
i
had
it
at

and

full

smooth
and
very

seek
this
one
out
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a

theres
a
lot
going
on
here
great
smooth
milk
stout
with
coffee
chocolate
spices
and
chili
pepper
heat
all
combined
into
one
complex
without
becoming
overpowering
unbalanced
or
muddled
pretty
stellar
beer
overall
i
picked
this
up
thinking
it
would
be
solid
but
not
spectacular
im
happy
to
say
i
was
wrong
and
will
be
returning
to
acquire
more
bottles
stat
among
the
best
of
the
trending
mexican
chocolatechilespice
stout
category
ive
had
aroma
is
exceptional
coffee
and
chocolate
then
peppers
and
cinnamon
raisin
bread
cinnamon
a
hint
of
pepper
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
at
the
finish
wow
great
beer
but
the
coffee
is
more
than
i
prefer
theres
also
a
hint
of
acrid
character
and
the
finish
is
a
touch
too
bitter
wish
it
were
a
little
more
full
in
body
i
hope
this
is
brewed
again
because
at
9
a
bomber
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
for
the
money
overall
so
many
delicious
ingredients
come
out
this
beer
was
delicuous
first
time
in
a
long
time
ive
had
and
reviewed
a
stone
beer
but
im
glad
i
had
this
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
lighter
imperial
stout
not
one
youd
have
trouble
drinking
a
whole
bomber
of
love
the
vanilla
cinnamon
and
cocoa
powder
flavors
in
it
could
use
with
a
bit
less
pepper
astringency
but
its
not
a
big
distractor
at
all
heck
it
may
actually
even
help
round
out
the
beer
and
keep
it
from
feeling
thin
but
i
wouldnt
know
unless
i
had
the
same
beer
without
the
peppers
recommended
if
youre
craving
something
with
some
cinnamon
and
vanilla
flavors
the
sheer
quantity
of
chocolaty
goodness
in
the
beer
is
absurd
it
smells
like
some
kind
of
magical
cookie
this
is
a
treat
to
say
the
least
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
interesting
but
this
is
a
nice
homage
to
the
inspirational
drink
spice
runs
a
bit
much
and
it
could
use
a
bit
more
heat
but
its
worth
drinking
at
least
twice
in
a
word
impressive
this
style
mexican
hotchocolatecoffee
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
times
with
a
number
of
breweries
exploring
this
flavor
combination
what
stone
has
created
is
an
absolute
beauty
of
a
coffeehot
chocolatecinnamonpepper
stout
without
a
question
this
is
the
best
beer
from
stone
that
ive
tried
and
easily
deserving
of
a
place
in
the
list
of
my
the
top
5
stouts
i
can
only
hope
that
they
decide
to
bring
this
back
on
a
regular
basis
as
it
would
regularly
find
its
way
into
my
refrigerator
at
8
9922oz
this
surely
has
to
be
a
more
economical
and
equally
delicious
alternative
to
the
likes
of
a
number
of
hardtofind
breweryonly
mexicanhotchocolatestyle
stouts
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
or
two
go
for
it
i
only
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
a
couple
more
overall
this
brew
is
ok
yet
again
when
i
see
stout
i
picture
the
beer
coating
my
palate
with
its
viscosity
the
flavor
is
light
and
a
bit
muddled
i
can
kill
the
bottle
so
i
guess
its
not
that
bad
this
brew
is
worthy
yeah
im
buying
a
case
o
for
the
price
got
mine
for
6
50
this
was
a
really
solid
beer
prefer
mexican
cake
but
it
is
twice
as
much
as
much
as
stone
is
known
for
the
ipas
i
really
like
when
they
travel
to
the
dark
side
with
a
new
eastern
brewery
in
the
works
i
hope
they
continue
great
beers
and
great
prices
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
wow
so
flavorful
and
the
flavors
balance
each
other
perfectly
its
sweet
bitter
and
even
a
tad
spicy
its
an
awesome
beer
this
is
an
intense
flavor
packed
drinking
experience
aroma
flavor
and
feel
all
are
pushed
to
11
a
bit
of
bitterness
especially
in
the
taste
is
all
the
holds
this
beer
back
from
being
truly
elite
overall
i
wish
this
was
a
beer
that
was
available
year
round
rather
than
a
one
off
brew
bottle
pours
black
light
is
too
feeble
to
pierce
this
brew
the
head
was
initially
a
huge
airy
puffed
and
brown
in
color
it
dies
off
to
a
very
thin
ring
that
has
leaves
long
lacing
islands
what
an
interesting
aroma
coffee
and
cinnamon
really
come
out
the
pepper
spice
is
right
there
too
the
flavor
is
less
dynamic
but
i
actually
prefer
its
more
rounded
flavors
im
happy
the
peppery
heat
isnt
as
intense
its
got
some
excellent
mocha
and
coffee
and
chocolate
the
cinnamon
is
as
soft
as
the
pepper
vanilla
is
also
detectable
body
matches
the
octane
pretty
well
medium
to
soft
carbonation
far
more
drinkable
than
i
was
expecting
i
wasnt
overly
in
love
with
the
flavors
but
i
liked
it
well
enough
new
stone
offerings
keep
me
and
many
like
me
come
ping
back
and
back
and
back
i
have
yet
to
have
a
stone
beer
collaboration
or
otherwise
that
has
disappointed
if
your
a
stout
drinker
you
cant
pass
this
up
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
schooner
the
beer
is
a
dark
almost
jet
black
coloring
with
mahogany
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
tall
dense
foamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
tight
surface
coating
beautiful
the
aromas
are
toasty
and
cinnamon
forward
with
subtle
chocolate
and
mocha
coffee
in
the
background
it
almost
smells
like
a
chai
latte
nice
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
forward
with
a
blast
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
as
well
as
a
healthy
dose
of
cinnamon
some
pepper
heat
slips
in
the
background
not
to
overpower
but
to
enhance
everything
vanilla
highlights
help
round
everything
out
too
pretty
layered
and
rich
palate
the
chocolate
and
subtle
heat
join
the
cinnamon
spice
in
the
aftertaste
this
smooth
slightly
dry
brew
provides
a
smooth
almost
creamy
finish
with
a
cinnamon
and
roast
linger
some
of
that
coffee
bitter
lingers
too
great
beer
o
another
very
nice
chili
peppermexican
hot
chocolate
styled
beer
i
really
think
these
flavors
work
great
in
the
base
of
a
milk
stout
easy
to
drink
with
very
well
hidden
alcohol
is
matching
very
well
with
the
chili
im
making
and
ive
added
a
small
amount
to
the
batch
of
chili
as
well
total
4350
oseriously
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
all
make
a
presence
and
blend
perfectly
nothing
is
overpowering
perhaps
stones
best
beer
and
they
have
a
damn
arsenal
of
great
beers
overall
its
a
style
that
doesnt
always
appeal
to
myself
but
the
complexity
on
this
beer
and
melding
flavors
is
incredibly
impressive
overall
a
fantastically
unique
take
on
a
traditional
style
ill
be
buying
as
many
bottles
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
really
what
is
the
big
deal
with
this
one
if
this
didnt
say
stone
on
it
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
from
a
far
smaller
and
lessregarded
brewery
will
not
drink
again
very
sweet
but
overall
fantastic
milk
stout
this
is
a
great
unique
stout
its
fitting
for
the
fall
and
has
a
pumpkin
stout
type
vibe
it
would
be
great
during
the
holidays
as
well
this
is
a
winner
stone
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
its
incredibly
tasty
and
well
done
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
unlike
montezumas
revenge
creeping
up
on
you
like
a
babys
diaper
after
its
morning
porridge
this
latin
masterpiece
is
a
welcome
sight
black
like
a
mamba
with
a
glorious
hint
of
chile
spice
like
that
modern
family
chick
in
a
two
piece
taste
has
said
nice
spice
also
with
delicate
caramel
and
all
that
other
stouty
stuff
only
let
down
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lacking
but
hey
you
cant
expect
gold
everyday
jet
black
with
a
rich
brown
head
very
little
lace
as
i
drink
it
and
head
retention
is
minimal
smells
strong
of
chocolate
more
milk
chocolate
than
dark
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
so
much
going
on
here
some
chocolate
with
a
lot
of
spices
and
sweet
vanilla
the
spices
maybe
nutmeg
take
over
but
not
in
a
bad
way
tastes
like
christmas
eve
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
close
to
thick
chocolate
milk
overall
an
incredible
beer
so
unique
and
complex
so
much
going
on
but
nothing
really
fights
for
attention
everything
just
falls
into
place
definitely
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
to
stock
and
store
overall
this
stout
is
not
one
to
be
missed
it
is
definitely
a
seasonal
stout
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
shine
through
but
this
is
a
chocolate
dominant
stout
a
lot
of
times
chocolatemilk
stouts
go
terribly
wrong
due
to
too
low
of
an
abv
or
too
high
at
8
this
offering
is
alluring
and
satisfying
this
is
not
a
big
stout
or
something
akin
to
an
russian
imperial
as
the
drinkability
is
astounding
this
fluffy
and
tasty
collaborative
stout
is
one
of
a
kind
o
really
awesome
creation
of
a
mexican
hot
chocolatecoffeebeerthing
love
the
lower
abv
drinkability
balance
of
allaround
great
flavors
just
pure
tasty
goodness
great
as
a
autumn
breakfast
andor
dessert
beer
this
will
probably
be
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
this
season
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
pitch
black
appearing
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
very
aromatic
dominated
by
mexican
chocolate
with
the
cinnamon
typical
of
this
style
of
chocolate
coffee
sweet
dark
malt
spicy
and
appealing
flavor
is
sweet
dark
malt
lactose
light
mexican
chocolate
and
coffee
pie
spices
lightly
nutty
nice
medium
creamy
body
amazingly
well
balanced
with
the
spices
and
milk
stout
components
complimenting
each
other
perfectly
and
a
nice
note
of
coffee
in
the
background
this
could
have
easily
been
dominated
by
any
of
the
strong
flavors
but
everything
is
in
harmony
abv
well
covered
this
could
be
a
rich
chocolate
infused
horchata
recommended
overall
a
rather
nice
stout
lots
of
spice
and
with
a
little
less
lactosemilk
then
would
have
been
expected
for
the
style
but
quite
nice
none
the
less
a
good
thick
roasted
coffee
and
spicy
stout
serving
type
bottle
really
nice
no
obnoxious
or
overpowering
notes
in
here
all
the
ingredients
play
their
part
and
are
balanced
and
delicious
definitely
captures
the
mexican
mochahot
chocolate
feel
this
will
be
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
holiday
season
o
uniquely
enjoyable
overall
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
drinkable
my
first
chance
at
a
spiced
stout
in
the
hunapuhabraxasmexican
cake
vein
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
new
beers
of
the
year
the
flavor
has
a
light
peppery
entry
with
mild
hint
of
cinnamon
and
cocoa
sweetness
coming
through
fresh
with
an
element
of
vanilla
and
light
coffeenutmeg
woody
earthiness
and
light
malt
roastiness
mingling
with
the
spice
pretty
close
to
the
description
of
a
mexican
hot
chocolate
with
peppers
adding
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
heat
with
the
coffee
and
cocoa
in
a
cohesive
mocha
taste
with
a
nice
fresh
maltiness
and
hints
of
char
and
vanilla
that
blend
well
with
the
spice
overall
a
wonderful
coffee
and
cocoa
stout
with
nice
blend
of
pepper
with
cinnamon
and
a
very
enjoyable
base
stout
to
make
a
beer
that
is
better
than
individual
interests
combined
it
really
works
as
a
blend
of
spices
integrated
exceptional
o
amazing
7
22oz
beer
will
pick
up
a
few
more
of
this
one
overall
this
is
a
tasty
milk
stout
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
overall
im
glad
i
didnt
pass
on
this
but
probably
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
the
best
stone
collaboration
i
can
think
of
to
this
day
balance
is
key
and
all
of
the
added
ingredients
have
their
share
of
the
flavor
give
me
a
na
version
for
breakfast
and
im
a
happy
man
cheers
stone
maybe
their
best
new
beer
in
years
my
biggest
complaint
and
score
dinger
is
the
viscosity
the
base
beer
feels
exactly
like
their
coffee
milk
stout
to
me
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
i
realize
that
it
is
lower
in
abv
and
i
appreciate
that
more
often
these
days
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
great
flavor
profile
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
an
outstanding
beer
at
a
great
price
too
6
since
taste
is
still
the
most
important
part
i
gave
it
a
4
25
overall
easily
my
second
favorite
chili
pepper
beer
make
sure
to
try
it
no
oxford
comma
this
beer
is
now
terrible
o
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
this
closer
to
christmas
time
a
surprisingly
refreshing
stout
not
heavy
very
medium
bodied
i
would
love
to
see
this
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
22oz
bottle
8
99
dark
black
not
much
of
a
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
spice
not
bad
flavor
is
cinnamon
vanilla
coffee
spice
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
very
nice
mocha
stout
incredibly
interesting
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
another
winner
from
stone
o
i
am
quite
happy
that
i
decided
to
give
this
bottle
a
chance
thanks
beer
advocate
reviews
it
was
really
good
i
will
be
back
to
get
another
one
tomorrow
afternoon
o
a
very
nice
and
complex
mocha
stout
with
plenty
of
subtle
nuances
and
spice
notes
that
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
quite
a
treat
to
drink
and
enjoy
slowly
if
it
were
a
little
heavier
or
thicker
this
would
be
the
perfect
dessert
beer
o
excellent
not
a
fan
of
pepper
beers
but
this
one
does
it
perfect
like
all
wellcrafted

couldnt
really
put
into
words
what
this
beer
did
for
me
i
guess
it
is
because
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
found
shoocovaysah
to
be
very
unique
and
delicious
i
can
only
hope
that
greg
koch
realizes
that
he
is
potentially
sitting
on
goldmine
should
he
decide
to
make
this
a
regular
release
believe

hype
that
has
spawned
around
this
stout

with
the
spices
becoming
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
falls
a
bit
flat
unfortunately
way
thinner
than
expected
i
get
the
coffee
up
front
and
the
cinnamon
lingers
in
the
finish
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
more
rich
and
complex
almost
no
pepper
or
vanilla
flavor
the
body
is
also
lighter
than
expected
a
simmering
spiciness
bellows
up
from
underneath

great
roasted
malted
aroma
however
it
is
overly
roasted
and
bitter
in
flavor
its
not
creamy
or
milky
at
all
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
overall
product
pours
thick
and
rich
a
very
dark
1finger
head
quickly
falls
theres
a
viscous
coating
on
the
glass
as
its
tipped
the
aroma
is
big
and
enveloping
full
of
deep
fruity
smells
the
beers
taste
is
what
one
might
expect
of
a
sip
of
dessert
wine
with
dry
burntcoffee
notes
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
big
stout
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
hard
to
distinguish
from
many
imperials
quite
an
accomplishment
for
a
7
5
libation
mouthfeel
lives
up
to
the
name
pours
a
nice
light
creamy
brown
head
with
decent
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
malt
malted
milk
roast
marshmallows
taste
is
subtle
chocolate
milk
nice
smoke
presence
with
darker
chocolate
residuals
overall
a
very
nice
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
smoky
flavor
that
dominates
only
gets
to
the
typical
milk
stout
sweet
creaminess
on
the
finish
but
too
smoky
for
my
taste
the
name
says
it
alltoo
cream
a
great
stout
overall
this
is
an
ultrasmooth
and
drinkable
roasty
stout
one
of
the
more
sessionable
stouts
ive
come
across
12oz
bottle
poured
into
nonic
this
beer
is
opaque
black
with
a
quarter
inch
of
light
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
carried
by
roasted
malts
and
coffee
plus
creamy
lactose
sugar
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
it
has
a
subdued
vanilla
cream
sweetness
that
rolls
in
after
a
strong
wave
of
coffee
molasses
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
mediumlight
body
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
that
are
disappointing
soft
carbonation
and
a
long
roasty
finish
that
are
quite
nice
coffee
t
t
t
t
pours
darker
than
i
expected
deep
dark
chocolate
color
almost
no
head
stronger
chocolate
in
the
nose
than
i
anticipated
but
not
a
truly
strong
chocolate
smell
taste
is
of
chocolate
that
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
maltiness
in
the
background
reminds
me
of
boulder
beers
shake
only
this
is
its
older
more
intense
brother
imperial
stoutish
without
the
coffee
nor
the
higher
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
very
easily
i
will
buy
again
and
suggest
those
who
havent
tried
it
to
seek
it
out
pours
a
nice
deep
black
with
no
light
getting
through
theres
a
nice
dark
brown
head
that
comes
with
it
and
settles
down
quickly
leaving
some
oily
lacing
the
aroma
is
big
rich
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
a
little
light
missing
the
big
rich
flavors
of
the
aroma
but
does
have
a
nice
light
hops
finish
the
body
is
also
a
little
light
even
for
a
milk
stout
but
it
has
almost
no
carbonation
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
very
solid
brew
from
these
guys
o
im
enjoying
it
kinda
but
its
not
really
making
an
impression
on
me
from
the
soil
overall
its
a
nice
enough
stout
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
though
the
creaminess
i
was
expecting
wasnt
apparent
at
all
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
in
the
sweet
sense
but
instead
this
stout
has
a
very
distinct
smokey
oak
taste
to
it
the
aroma
isnt
as
pleasant
as
i
would
have
liked
and
very
lingering
smokey
aftertaste
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
like
most
stouts
if
you
are
fan
of
the
very
earthy
oak
and
smoked
flavors
you
would
like
but
ive
had
much
better
stouts
flavor
excellent
sweetbitter
balance
with
the
light
sweetness
overcome
by
mild
bitterness
by
the
finish
lingering
dark
roasted
malts
and
black
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
is
smooth
charred
malts
and
dark
fruit
duking
it
out
on
the
palate
for
dominance
finishes
with
more
of
the
bittersweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
delicious
and
smooth
stout
that
approaches
some
russian
imperial
stouts
even
superb
not
too
heavy
on
the
lactose
for
a
milk
stout
but
it
is
sweet
the
roast
is
mild
overall
its
a
rich
robust
complex
very
enjoyable
stout
this
was
visually
stunning
coming
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
it
looked
like
high
viscosity
engine
oil
40weight
as
it
did
its
pseudocascade
and
then
formed
a
finger
of
dense
deepbrown
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
allowing
zero
light
penetration
this
is
their
interpretation
of
a
cream
stout
nose
was
rich
and
chocolaty
more
towards
dark
chocolate
with
a
charcoal
smokiness
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
creamy
and
the
taste
was
incredibly
smoky
which
while
appealing
to
me
is
stylistically
incorrect
why
would
they
make
fore
and
this
i
left
a
bit
in
the
bottle
so
as
to
be
able
to
stir
up
the
lees
for
an
additional
pour
but
it
really
did
not
change
things
by
much
except
to
intensify
the
smokiness
if
that
is
possible
finish
was
bitter
smoky
dry
all
of
which
adds
up
to
something
other
than
a
milksweet
stout
i
am
not
a
style
maven
by
any
stretch
but
this
was
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
o
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
elements
of
the
aroma
in
the
flavor
as
it
smells
wonderful
but
the
taste
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
still
its
drinkable
enough
and
theres
nothing
necessarily
wrong
with
it
just
feel
like
it
could
be
so
much
better
o
based
on
the
appearance
and
nose
i
expected
big
things
the
taste
was
way
off
the
nose
and
not
really
in
a
good
way
i
am
desperately
sipping
and
hoping
for
hints
of
chocolate
and
more
coffee
but
i
am
just
getting
smoke
there
are
other
stouts
in
this
series
from
dark
horse
i
have
them
and
will
try
them
i
think
there
is
one
that
is
a
smoked
porter
i
cant
imagine
something
smokier
than
this
dark
horse
too
cream
stout
3
55
of
the
numbers
stouts
in
this
series
that
ive
had
all
but
fore
this
ranks
3
behind
tres
blueberry
and
plead
the
5th
and
slightly
better
than
one
oatmeal
not
overly
bitter
or
roasty
with
a
great
chocolate
presence
the
tinge
of
tartness
adds
complexity
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
chocolate
very
rich
malt
character
bottled
pours
pitch
black
with
an
average
sized
creamy
head
aroma
of
slightly
roasted
malt
and
note
of
chocolate
light
coffee
and
vanilla
sweet
flavor
that
ends
up
quite
dry
with
notes
of
malt
bitterness
medium
bodied
oily
to
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
an
excellent
stout
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
winter
months
big
roasty
quality
will
leave
you
wanting
to
sip
this
one
all
night
quick
edit
i
recommend
getting
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
as
it
thickens
up
the
brew
considerably
and
really
pushes
it
over
the
top
after
doing
that
it
turned
a
very
good
beer
into
a
great
one
you
gotta
get
that
all
in
the
bottle
its
thick
and
rich
with
a
moderate
viscosity
that
gives
great
body
and
smoothness
without
sitting
like
a
brick
theres
just
the
slightest
crispness
enough
to
keep
it
lively
and
interesting
and
the
smoothness
pulls
even
into
the
roasty
finish
overall
a
great
stout
i
like
them
dark
and
roasty
and
this
one
delivers
one
of
the
blackest
pours
ive
seen
viscous
and
thick
bubbly
dark
brown
body
with
average
retention
wisps
of
creamy
coffee
fill
the
air
as
well
as
dark
chocolate
and
some
bittersweet
variety
as
well
strong
oatmeal
taste
chocolate
upfront
transforms
into
smooth
creamy
coffee
medium
bodied
and
overall
a
nice
stout
overall
really
loved
the
look
and
aroma
that
this
one
brought
but
was
very
disappointed
once
i
began
to
drink
it
chocolate
flavors
are
off
dairy
tones
are
oddly
sweet
and
bitter
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
perfect
for
smoking
a
pipe
and
reading
turgenev
while
feeling
like
a
boss
dark
thick
head
when
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
the
taste
was
incredible
chocolates
but
not
overpowering
you
could
smell
the
creaminess
quite
liberally
if
that
makes
sense
heartily
recommended
o
a
big
improvement
over
one
oatmeal
a
nice
representative
of
the
cream
stout
style
buts
almost
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
the
incredible
mouthfeel
especially
for
a
nonimperial
stout
elevates
this
already
delicious
brew
to
a
level
beyond
that
of
an
ordinary
stout
bells
double
cream
was
quite
tasty
but
this
one
leaves
it
in
the
dust
and
is
much
easier
to
find
to
boot
awesome
beer
at
a
bargain
price
to
boot
really
good
beer
if
not
the
creamiest
of
the
style
solid
stout
offering
i
prefer
one
oatmeal
to
this
its
missing
something
in
the
middle
perhaps
some
lactose
sweetness
of
which
i
did
not
get
and
its
a
bit
watery
if
the
cream
aspect
was
talking
about
lactose
i
did
not
get
much
of
it
if
it
was
referring
to
a
cream
mouthfeel
its
halfway
there
but
it
is
not
anything
like
bells
double
cream
stout
an
interesting
stout
to
try
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
cinnamon
colored
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
there
is
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
cream
the
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
being
the
most
dominant
there
is
a
subdued
sweetness
and
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
i
did
not
expect
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
expected
it
to
be
a
good
bit
sweeter
o
a
solid
stout
from
dark
horse
definitely
better
than
one
from
the
stout
line
d
this
was
a
better
stout
than
one
with
nice
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
finish
was
smoother
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
still
nothing
special
but
more
enjoyable
to
try
overall
great
cream
stout
up
there
with
bells
double
bottle
picked
up
recently
in
michigan
pours
a
silky
oily
black
with
a
coffee
coloured
head
that
disappears
more
quickly
than
i
expected
given
its
visual
density
beautiful
aroma
of
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
plus
roasted
dark
and
chocolate
malts
the
whole
chocolate
spectrum
with
vanilla
and
coffee
tones
lightly
riding

silky
sweetness
in
more
pronounced
in

flavour
which
is
very
suitable
for
the
style

might
be
challenging
to
enjoy
more
than

than
dark

oatmeal
stout
closes
dry
with
mild
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
mild
astringency
from
the
roasted
malts
overall
my
favorite
milk
stout
to
date
a
really
excellent
smooth
chocolate
taste
combined
with
the
sweetness
and
slight
metallic
puckering
of
the
lactose
i
was
surprised
that
i
liked
this
one
so
much
would
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
solid
sweetmilk
stout
great
mix
of
chocolate
espresso
and
roast
to
create
a
wonderful
tasting
and
smelling
brew
this
is
where
the
tannin
makes
a
slight
appearance
you
can
feel
its
mild
character
a
creaminess
is
present
but
challenged
by
a
tingle
that
doesnt
let
your
mouth
get
too
relaxed
while
enjoying
it
beautiful
job
dark
horse
above
average
stout
good
flavor
and
body
at
a
nottoohigh
abv
definitely
worth
having
hadnt
had
a
good
stout
in
a
while
this
hit
the
spot
pours
dark
as
expected
with
a
minimal
bronze
head
the
smell
is
very
bitter
with
a
kind
of
tin
nose
as
well
much
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
extremely
bitter
chocolate
this
is
not
for
me
but
if
you
are
a
bitter
chocolate
fan
than
you
will
definitely
like
this
the
upfront
taste
is
not
bad
but
really
the
downfall
of
this
beer
is
the
aftertaste
very
bitter
and
leaves
a
faint
harsh
taste
on
the
tongue
i
dont
find
this
creamy
or
a
milk
stout
if
there
was
a
bitter
stout
category
this
would
be
a
prefect
fit
would
not
buy
this
again
pours
dark
with
a
tan
head
smells
of
burnt
chocolate
tastes
like
bitter
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
silky
smooth
overall
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
if
you
like
your
cream
stout
bitter
this
is
for
you
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
would
have
this
higher
than
a
4
but
the
taste
is
way
too
close
to
a
ris
to
really
rank
it
super
high
in
this
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
just
doesnt
quite
fit
as
a
cream
stout
to
me
that
being
said
i
will
purchase
more
of
this
and
enjoy
every
drop
o
a
good
sweet
stout
however
i
did
like
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
a
bit
better
i
was
getting
more
bitter
than
sweet
in
this
beer
a
solid
stout
that
i
would
have
again
but
would
seek
out
o
while
it
definitely
comes
off
like
a
cream
stout
there
are
many
times
drinking
this
where
i
think
it
might
be
an
imperial
stout
and
a
rocksolid
one
at
that
certainly
its
much
better
than
their
one
oatmeal
stout
o
id
try
this
one
again
at
some
point
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
looking
forward
to
trying
all
of
their
other
entries

very
well
balanced
with
extremely
robust
roasted
flavors
and
moderate

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
meh
this
one
didnt
wow
me
by
any
means
not
sweet
enough
there
are
many
other
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
i
enjoy
a
lot
of
dark
horse
beers
just
not
this
one
this
is
my
first
review
and
i
felt
it
had
to
be
for
this
cream
stout
because
this
one
was
very
disappointing
i
rarely
ever
drainpour
anything
but
this
one
lasted
just
enough
sips
to
review
very
light
body
for
a
cream
stout
and
not
nearly
sweet
enough
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
drowned
out
the
sweetness
a
cream
stout
should
have
the
smell
was
present
but
not
strong
enough
at
first
smell
not
well
done
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
milksweetcream
stouts
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
noir
with
a
thin
ring
of
a
head
reminiscent
of
espresso
its
lightly
carbonated
and
there
is
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
mostly
of
coffee
notes
with
sweet
cream
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
opens
very
sweetly
of
vanilla
and
creme
but
gives
way
to
some
bitter
hops
light
tobacco
and
bread
crust
the
finish
has
very
charred
ashy
and
burnt
characteristics
to
it
for
the
mouth
feel
its
very
light
the
abv
is
felt
slightly
on
the
way
down
pleasant
but
the
appearance
head
and
finish
could
use
some
improvement
overall
an
acceptable
cream
stout
though
a
bit
thin
and
not
quite
sweet
enough
to
suit
my
palate
not
one
i
would
suggest
seeking
out
but
definitely
worth
trying
if
its
sold
in
your
area
a
quality
brew
two
words
sour
milk
overall
this
is
a
very
good
milk
stout
featuring
a
very
powerful
arrangement
of
finely
assorted
flavors
that
will
be
sure
to
please
fans
of
the
style
the
ashycoffee
notes
are
perhaps
a
bit
too
strong
here
the
sugars
not
quite
able
to
keep
up
and
the
beer
could
have
used
a
bit
more
abv
to
add
a
greater
vanillabourbon
overtone
as
well
as
a
little
less
carbonation
but
even
without
those
changes
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
very
delicious
overall
decent
mild
and
very
easy
to
drink
balance
is
good
usually
milk
stouts
are
so
sweet
this
one
is
more
mild
and
malty
worth
a
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
not
digging
this
as
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
the
label
does
say
too
creamnot
feeling
it
gave
it
a
shot
though
and
i
feel
im
a
bit
generous
with
the
points
here
i
guess
if
you
are
looking
for
a
less
sweet
cream
stoutthis
ones
for
you
its
ok
not
great
meh
o
overall
straight
forward
and
to
the
point
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
one
its
a
solid
stout
but
nothing
fantastic
pours
pitch
black
with
a
brown
head
smells
of
huge
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
has
more
bitter
bite
than
i
expected
up
front
but
finishes
sweet
an
chocolatey
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
for
the
style
that
takes
away
from
its
creaminess
but
doesnt
interfere
with
the
flavor
too
much
solid
brew
notes
overall
this
is
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
cheers
rich
dark
coffee
hits
your
tongue
as
slide
down
bitter
while
taking
all
your
saliva
with
it
upon
swallowing
the
strange
odor
attacks
rich
heavy
stout
this
ales
greatest
asset
is
the
aftertaste
it
lingers
nicely
with
that
creamhopssweetness
it
works
nicely
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
great
brewery
like
dark
horse
gets
their
milk
stout
right
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
i
like
sweet
stouts
a
lot
and
this
one
is
good
not
quite
as
sweet
as
i
expected
but
pretty
well
balanced
the
head
is
simply
the
best
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
it
is
still
a
solid
layer
of
foam
on
top
so
much
so
that
it
looks
like
its
been
nitro
poured

man
ive
been
enjoying
this
holiday
stout
series
so
far
im
hoping
the
tres
in
my
fridge
continues
the
trend
o
solid
stout
with
some
good
flavors
accurate
for
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
bottle
to
drink
would
i
seek
it
out
again
depends
what
else
is
available
o
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
between
the
flavors
of
sweet
lactose
and
roasted
malts
its
also
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
good
stuff
o
if
this
beer
had
a
bigger
body
i
would
be
in
love
however
i
will
stick
with
bells
cream
stout
as
my
goto
for
this
area
i
prefer
a
creamier
fuller
body
with
such
flavors
dark
brownblack
with
a
mocha
head
dense
retention
and
some
sheets
of
lace
nose
has
roast
some
mocha
character
cocoa
and
some
creamy
coffee
underneath
taste
has
a
whole
load
of
roast
some
balancing
creamy
sweetness
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
in
some
regards
and
dark
chocolate
full
body
alcohol
wasnt
perceptible
a
nice
creammilk
stout
but
didnt
stand
out
as
exceptional
very
nice
nonetheless
this
is
an
incredibly
full
beer
thats
sharp
rough
and
exhibits
overall
burnt
character
far
greater
than
the
lactose
additions
can
balance
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
but
its
pretty
damn
good
the
smoked
flavors
in
the
middle
are
subtle
but
add
a
whole
other
element
to
the
brew
other
than
just
being
a
generic
milk
stout
very
tasty
o
this
was
a
nice
stout
however
i
definitely
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
milk
stout
there
definitely
wasnt
as
much
of
a
milk
or
creamy
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
i
was
also
a
little
bit
surprised
at
the
faint
smokiness
that
i
encountered
this
definitely
wasnt
the
smoked
stout
though
overall
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
however
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
your
typical
milk
stout
and
definitely
doesnt
compare
to
other
topnotch
milk
stouts
such
as
the
three
hour
tour
that
i
had
last
week
i
recommend
trying
this
out
especially
if
you
like
bitter
chocolate
and
stouts
that
arent
overly
sweet
o
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
winter
stouts
along
with
the
other
dark
horse
specialties
however
i
find
that
some
of
my
bottles
of
this
beer
taste
a
lot
better
and
more
cream
stout
than
others
o
very
easy
drinking
no
hint
at
all
of
the
alcohol
really
nice
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
really
wish
i
could
get
this
in
ny
overall
a
very
nice
stout
not
sweet
and
creamy
feeling
like
many
milk
stouts
but
a
nice
stout
all
the
same
edit
as
an
afterthought
i
reckon
this
would
really
benefit
from
aging
going
to
cellar
a
couple
of
these
o
a
solid
beer
overall
though
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
with
a
bit
more
depth
this
beer
gets
much
better
with
age
my
buddy
gave
me
a
four
pack
over
a
year
ago
and
when
i
tried
it
it
was
just
ok
i
left
one
of
the
beers
in
the
fridge
and
forgot
about
it
i
just
found
it
tonight
and
tried
it
fantastic
it
is
deceptively
bitter
when
i
was
expecting
a
milk
stout
strong
hints
of
tobacco
and
toasted
chocolate
overall
this
is
the
first
milk
stout
ive
ever
tried
im
giving
it
a
good
rating
because
i
know
that
its
good
for
its
style
i
just
personally
hate
coffee
lol
but
everything
else
is
great
for
a
style
i
dont
particularly
care
for
this
one
is
fantastic
my
second
favorite
of
the
fivepart
dark
horse
stout
series
i
loved
this
and
thats
saying
something
from
someone
who
isnt
a
big
fan
of
cream
stouts
here
ye
here
ye
4
0
bitter
malts
take
over
in
the
finish
but
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
sweep
in
to
save
things
finishes
very
nicely
and
is
definitely
the
highlight
of
the
beer
o
lacks
the
depth
and
character
of
some
of
the
other
stouts
that
dark
horse
brews
it
feels
a
little
generic
very
easy
to
drink
though
you
wouldnt
guess
that
its
8
abv
not
a
bad
buy
especially
given
the
relatively
limited
selection
of
milk
stouts
on
the
market
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
little
bitter
from
the
grain
on
the
finish
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
as
creamy
or
as
sweet
as
i
expect
a
milk
stout
to
be
the
body
is
big
so
im
not
going
to
mistake
this
for
an
fes
but
i
dont
quite
get
milk
stout
i
like
these
dark
horse
beers
though
and
id
have
this
one
again
overall
im
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
its
pretty
decent
worth
a
try
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
that
little
smidgeon
of
chalkiness
that
appears
in
the
finish
comes
across
as
slightly
awkward
when
in
a
cream
stout
not
quite
as
creamy
in
texture
as
most
cream
stouts
that
ive
had
quite
good
and
a
different
take
on
milksweet
stouts
that
i
anticipated
but
should
have
expected
nice
roasted
flavors
in
this
stout
but
heavy
on
the
coffee
flavor
which
im
not
that
into
excited
to
try
their
blueberry
stout
next
if
you
cant
get
it
on
tap
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pour
your
bottle
into
a
nice
pint
glass
of
some
kind
and
admire
the
beautiful
java
head
and
enjoy
immensely
the
flavor
mimics
the
smell
except
that
there
is
more
burnt
malt
taste
to
it
the
body
is
creamy
but
not
too
sweet
like
most
cream
stouts
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
nutty
with
a
linger
coffee
ground
taste
overall
very
nice
addition
to
the
four
part
series
cant
wait
to
try
out
tres
next
dark
horse
has
yet
to
dissapoint
me
with
this
series
overall
really
solid
brew
my
first
dark
horse
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
taste
evolution
is
great
the
aftertaste
is
fantastic
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
notes
of
flavors
that
youve
had
before
but
is
just
executed
and
put
together
much
better
than
before
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
milk
stout
solid
all
the
way
through
with
nothing
spectacular
but
no
real
faults
either
definitely
on
the
charredroasty
side
and
lower
on
the
sweetness
than
many
milk
stout
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
dh
stout
series
but
still
a
good
one
overall
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
opaque
brownblack
in
color
with
a
nice
inch
of
foam
head
disappeared
after
a
few
minutes
smell
of
very
roasted
malts
with
the
hint
of
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
the
nice
java
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
bitternes
to
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
c
to
b
overall
i
enjoyed
one
more
but
this
isnt
bad
for
a
milk
stout
i
try
not
to
hold
my
opinion
of
lactose
additions
against
these
beers
and
this
one
at
least
gave
me
a
decent
stout
behind
it
hard
to
get
but
seems
to
be
reasonably
priced
and
very
accessible
in
other
states
i
paired
the
beer
with
some
tuscany
grilled
ham
and
sharp
provolone
which
seems
to
have
worked
well
id
recommend
the
beer
to
others
and
im
glad
i
received
it
as
an
unexpected
extra
oim
pretty
impressed
with
this
stout
its
solid
tasting
yet
its
super
smooth
and
really
drinkable
even
dangerously
drinkable
i
would
say
this
borderlines
the
taste
of
an
american
imperial
stout
it
has
the
flavor
profile
i
recommend
this
and
will
get
this
again
if
i
see
it
overall
this
is
very
similar
to
one
oatmeal
stout
with
a
little
more
malt
character
it
lacks
the
sweetness
for
the
style
but
makes
up
for
it
with
a
solid
malt
presence
wellcrafted
and
creamy
overall
a
good
big
blast
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
lots
of
complex
flavors
a
sipping
beer
and
one
is
enough
so
not
really
for
sessions
but
a
good
one
if
you
just
want
one
big
dark
malted
brew
i
would
drink
one
of
these
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
nice
milksweet
stout
good
flavors
with
an
interesting
hop
presence
a
bit
of
alcohol
gives
a
nice
warmth
solid
finish
and
something
i
would
definitely
have
again
overall
this
is
a
real
solid
entry
from
dark
horse
lots
of
flavor
for
the
palate
and
extremely
drinkable
the
lack
of
any
milkiness
in
the
taste
detracts
from
its
overall
rating
for
me
as
that
extra
milkiness
would
have
made
this
one
stand
out
rather
than
seeming
like
another
imp
stout
albeit
an
above
average
imperial
a
good
drinking
beer
with
a
bold
smooth
and
sweet
taste
o
another
very
good
stout
from
dark
horse

d
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
love
the
aftertaste
my
favorite
part
pretty
good
other
than
that
though
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
smoke
flavor
overwhelms
a
bit
and
the
good
creaminess
of
the
milk
stout
is
missing
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
maybe
a
bit
strong
for
a
milk
stout
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
great
its
nicely
balanced
not
too
malty
and
sweet
and
not
too
roasted
and
bitter
o
its
quite
good
super
creamy
and
decadent
ill
have
to
try
baking
with
this
someday
o
overall
this
one
has
some
time
on
it
as
i
received
it
a
while
back
and
it
tastes
pretty
fantastic
still
seems
more
ris
to
me
than
milk
stout
either
way
another
fine
beer
from
dark
horse
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
me
word
on
the
street
is
that
they
will
be
hitting
ny
soon
so
fingers
crossed
and
cant
wait
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
the
lactic
qualities
keep
it
from
drinking
more
than
12
at
a
time
but
good
to
go
back
to
again
especially
at
a
low
price
similar
to
one
and
plead
the
fifth
very
good
not
quite
elite
but
absolutely
worth
having
and
a
pretty
good
value

very

drink
just
like
a

should
be
not
to
overdone
on
the
flavors
just
right
ill
think
i
will
get
another
o
pretty
good
cream
stout
will
buy
these
when
i
cant
find
bells
special
double
cream
this
winter
i
know
its
a
milk
stout
but
i
wish
it
had
a
thicker
body
to
it
o
this
is
again
a
good
beer
from
dark
horse
however
it
has
its
flaws
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
too
high
for
a
milk
stout
and
the
lacto
lingers
for
far
too
long
after
o
it
seems
to
be
lacking
something
but
not
sure
what
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
would
recommend
it
it
was
a
great
take
on
the
milk
stout
i
also
thought
it
was
much
better
then
dark
horses
one
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
this
one
second
in
the
series
and
second
on
the
day
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
pitch
black
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
subtle
roasted
malt
and
slight
cream
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
cream
subtle
coffee
and
subtle
smoke
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
really
didnt
get
me
excited
about
this
one
very
much
however
the
flavor
proved
to
be
quite
nice
and
complex
i
really
like
the
smoke
aspect
i
picked
up
on
as
it
was
definitely
a
first
i
have
gotten
in
this
style
a
well
done
brew
but
could
use
a
few
tweeks
to
be
excellent
overall
excellent
aroma
and
decent
flavor
although
the
sweetness
was
just
a
bit
onedimensional
at
times
also
the
sting
from
the
co2
detracted
from
the
perception
of
creaminess
in
the
beer
i
think
a
sidebyside
w
bells
double
cream
would
highlight
this
fact
overall
definitely
one
to
try
but
not
an
a
level
beer
in
my
opinion

of

ive
had
a
very

good
stout

not

the

was

from
this

the

fairly

impressed
this

not

does
an
excellent
job
of
presenting
a

without

a

that
also
seems
to
go
down
fairly

d
its

not

heavy
like
a
ris
would
be
the
sweetness
makes
this
easy
to
take
down
overall
a
solid
tasty
brew
but
not
worth
going
crazy
over
i
set
the
bar
pretty
high
for
this
brew
and
despite
falling
short
im
pleased
with
the
brew
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
compares
to
the
rest
of
the

notes
cant
tell
too
much
difference
between
this
and
the

opportunity
to
try
overall
a
rather
tasty
brew
decently
drinkable
but
too
heavy
for
a
session
beer
but
if
you
want
a
nice
heavy
strong
flavored
stout
then
this
is
for
you
definitely
worth
a
try
easy
drinking
stout
not
a
memorable
one
really
but
the
lack
of
a
head
makes
me
think
this
was
old
and
stale
d
a
good
beer
to
have
one
or
two
of
definitely
not
a
session
brew
feels
to
me
like
this
is
high
abv
for
the
style
also
pretty
filling
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
love
stouts
and
the
flavors
and
subtleness
of
the
cream
really
make
it
a
joy
to
drink
overall
really
great
sweet
stout
i
wish
i
had
a
newer
example
to
compare
the
flavors
with
but
will
be
happy
knowing
i
was
pleased
with
this
and
dark
horse
doesnt
seem
to
disappoint
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
small
tan
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
cream
the
taste
is
full
of
graham
cracker
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
cream
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
which
might
be
a
little
high
for
a
stout
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
enjoying
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
mighty
nice
cream
stout
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
cream
stout
d
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
it
just
isnt
that
great
either
still
the
coffee
maltiness
is
sort
of
interesting
if
you
forget
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
probably
not
something
i
will
buy
again
dmoderate
the
roasty
blackness
takes
a
clear
centerstage
in
this
beer
so
it
seems
to
lack
somewhat
the
creamsweet
stout
character
i
think
that
the
complexity
when
i
could
peel
off
the
layers
of
roast
to
see
whats
underneath
was
very
enjoyable
d
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
one
this
was
dead
on
for
its
style
without
being
a
one
note
song
it
maintained
a
nice
mix
of
chocolates
along
with
some
nice
herbal
notes
to
make
this
a
beer
i
would
look
out
for
this
beer
is
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
head
that
looks
like
blowing
bubbles
into
chocolate
milk
with
a
straw
some
average
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
but
this
looks
perfect
for
a
sweet
stout
nice
semisweet
aroma
light
chocolate
and
roasty
notes
but
nothing
spectacular
slight
lactic
sourness
in
the
background
flavor
is
nice
chocolatey
sweetness
creamy
light
roasted
flavors
almost
no
bitterness
at
all
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
so
creamy
on
the
the
tongue
but
doesnt
quite
reach
full
bodied
for
such
a
dark
beer
carbonation
is
light
but
only
adds
to
the
silkiness
this
is
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
can
barely
be
felt
a
very
nice
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
so
far
from
dark
horse
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
goose
island
shaker
glass
appears
a
super
dark
brown
color
with
around
a
finger
of
creamy
dense
caramel
colored
foam
smells
of
rich
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
liqueur
tastes
of
both
bittersweet
and
semisweet
cocoa
rich
roasted
grains
and
a
mild
lactic
sourness
towards
the
finish
a
notch
below
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
still
pretty
tasty
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
the
beer
poured
black
and
the
brown
headlacing
disippated
quite
quickly
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
bitter
roastness
and
sweet
lactose
the
taste
seemed
a
little
too
sweet
milk
chocolatey
and
kind
of
onenoted
it
doesnt
linger
after
your
sip
not
much
complexity
and
the
body
was
a
bit
weaker
than
anticipated
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nearly
black
pour
with
a
light
brown
head
nice
roasty
aromas
small
amount
of
milk
chocolate
full
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
nearly
creamy
heavy
roasted
malt
and
coffee
but
balanced
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
milk
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
thought
this
was
excellent
but
i
seem
to
like
many
brews
ive
had
of
this
style
this
like
the
other
top
of
the
style
really
balance
out
the
sweetness
which
makes
them
have
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
too
is
a
very
very
good
beer
ive
got
a
small
qualm
with
the
style
label
irrespective
of
that
it
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
improvement
on
the
nose
and
it
would
benefit
from
a
thicker
body
small
complaints
damn
good
beer
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
this
is
so
damn
good
highly
recommend
m
medium
body
carbonation
is
a
tiny
bit
lacking
but
soft
carbonation
is
present
i
would
consider
using
this
beer
to
introduce
people
to
darker
beers
although
id
take
left
hand
first
and
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
these
for
an
evening
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
a
sweet
and
delicious
milk
stout
unimpressive
drinkability
carbonation
leaves
beer
somewhat
lacking
overall
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
holiday
stout
series
but
its
still
pretty
good
not
the
best
cream
stout
but
its
a
solid
choice
this
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
brew
but
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
a
couple
without
wanting
to
go
onto
something
else
with
a
bit
more
complexity
in
flavor
perhaps
with
a
little
more
carbonation
the
rich
flavors
hinted
at
in
the
nose
could
really
come
through
d
meh
one
bottle
is
enough
maybe
my
hopes
for
dark
horse
were
high
but
this
one
didnt
impress
me
its
pretty
basic
nothing
offense
about
it
but
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
either
even
the
purest
light
cannot
penetrate
this
creamy
beers
pitch
black
exterior
just
a
small
brown
film
of
suds
after
the
pour
that
diminishes
to
nothing
very
quickly
very
dark
roasted
aroma
brings
to
mind
black
coffee
from
711
but
with
a
touch
of
milk
poured
in
well
roasted
rich
flavored
kona
coffe
starts
the
taste
of
right
then
add
some
very
rich
milk
straight
from
the
cows
udder
very
raw
creamy
texture
just
a
little
sweetness
added
to
this
bitter
roasted
black
as
night
malt
bomb
dark
horse
too
is
somewhat
of
a
mixed
bag
on
the
pour
it
fails
to
produce
any
head
but
on
the
plus
side
its
one
of
the
darkest
stouts
ive
seen
even
while
holding
it
up
to
direct
light
its
completely
pitch
black
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
graham
crackers
and
faintly
alcoholic
in
the
mouth
its
very
thin
very
still
and
has
little
if
any
aftertaste
for
a
cream
stout
id
expect
a
bit
more
creamyness
but
fortunately
it
isnt
overly
sweet
you
could
definitely
drink
alot
of
these
and
they
werent
expensive
8
for
6
i
believe
if
youre
new
to
stouts
you
might
enjoy
this
for
its
mildness
for
a
cream
stout
this
is
not
real
sweet
well
you
cant
win
em
all
id
definitely
seek
out
something
else
drinkability
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
its
intensely
flavorful
and
full
of
roasted
maltiness
that
i
didnt
even
know
was
possible
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
big
thanks
again
to
jon
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
almost
too
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
milk
stout
with
a
surprisingly
fruityhoppy
aspect
pours
pitch
black
with
a
shortlived
mocha
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
leaving
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
lactose
in
the
form
of
bakers
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
coffee
bitterness
up
front
before
giving
way
to
a
substantial
burnt
malt
backbone
the
finish
brings
back
the
bitterness
but
in
a
pretty
unpleasant
chalky
way
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
average
stout
and
not
as
enjoyable
as
the
first
in
the
series
for
me
im
hoping
for
more
with
the
rest
of
the
series
the
thickness
and
bitterness
make
this
beer
a
delightful
sipper
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
put
more
than
two
of
these
away
at
a
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
this
pours
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
roasty
malt
and
cream
smell
with
a
similar
taste
along
with
a
faint
smokiness
too
medium
to
light
carbonation
and
a
nice
lightly
rich
body
solid
cream
stout
wow
what
a
beer
its
edgy
enough
to
get
your
attention
but
smooth
enough
to
be
a
pleasant
sipper
bottoms
up
mouthfeel
could
be
thicker
but
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
an
oil
black
color
with
very
tiny
tan
head
that
fades
almost
instantly
leaves
very
little
lacing
and
a
bit
of
an
oily
residue
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
plums
licorice
and
coffee
tastes
of
bitter
bakers
cocoa
dark
fruit
and
molasses
with
a
touch
of
lactose
and
coffee
finish
with
a
hint
of
anise
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
low
in
carbonation
a
little
metallic
and
not
very
creamy
due
to
the
bitterness
and
roastiness
throughout
a
little
disappointing
to
me
i
was
expecting
more
creaminess
than
it
delivered
but
ill
revisit
this
one
again
next
year
when
i
have
the
chance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
delicious
the
name
doesnt
lie
the
head
is
great
to
swish
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
n
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
sweet
stouts
i
have
had
rich
in
complexity
and
low
in
bv
it
is
the
perfect
session
able
stout
for
the
evening
i
would
be
happy
t
have
this
one
again
any
day
d
i
believe
these
are
about
8abv
but
the
bottle
doesnt
you
really
dont
taste
it
but
i
feel
it
hitting
me
as
i
write
this
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
would
be
tops
overall
a
good
beer
overall
there
are
many
great
brewers
in
the
midwest
and
dark
horse
is
often
over
looked
when
people
start
talking
about
the
midwest
they
should
not
be
they
brew
great
beers
as
i
sample
beer
after
beer
i
become
more
amazed
the
continually
put
out
top
notch
beers
that
many
never
get
to
sample
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
some
you
will
be
happy
you
did
d
a
damn
fine
milk
stout
i
find
oatmeal
and
milk
stouts
far
more
drinkable
than
dry
stouts
due
to
the
thicker
sweetness
and
this
is
no
exception
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
session
this
one
though
its
more
of
a
sipper
dgood
stuffcouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
but
thats
the
style
worth
checking
out
d
overall
this
is
a
stout
that
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
that
is
where
this
beer
stands
out
however
on
the
whole
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
had
really
no
nose
which
was
surprising
give
all
of
the
flavor
in
it
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
could
be
a
bit
thicker
this
would
be
a
good
stout
to
have
with
a
big
piece
of
chocolate
cake
as
it
has
big
flavors
but
it
is
not
heavy
at
all
as
you
could
easily
finish
the
4
pack
of
this
in
no
time
d
it
was
thin
and
light
with
a
dry
body
it
lacked
creaminess
and
was
not
particullarily
well
belened
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
mild
porter
with
the
coffee
strongly
emerging
but
not
overwhelming
the
caramel
and
molasses
this
is
certainly
tasty
cream
stout
its
also
a
piece
of
cake
to
down
smooth
and
rich
very
good
stuff
another
hit
from
dark
horse
not
quite
the
equal
of
crooked
tree
but
this
is
no
lightweight
all
in
all
well
worth
a
try
a
nice
dessert
beer
d
a
decent
offering
from
dark
horse
i
cant
drink
anymore
of
these
this
is
less
than
impressive
and
barely
toleralble
for
me
perhaps
if
the
carbonation
were
better
it
would
be
easier
to
drink
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
black
body
with
a
small
khaki
head
that
quickly
falls
away
just
a
spot
or
two
of
patchy
lace
aroma
has
waves
of
milk
and
dark
chocolates
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
roast
smooth
and
creamy
body
with
low
carbonation
taste
has
a
ton
of
chocolate
some
coffee
bitterness
from
the
dark
roast
and
a
mild

note

pretty

an
opaque

medium
bodied
with

almost
feels
milk
chocolatey
drinkability
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
but
this
is
not
a
very
nuanced
or
remarkable
beer
even
for
a
session
you
cant
see
through
the
pour
darkness
follows
in
the
foamy
dark
tan
head
that
resists
fading
little
lacing
present
the
smell
is
interesting
because
you
get
that
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
sauce
pan
of
over
cooked
milk
thats
ready
for
cocoa
the
combination
of
that
and
a
light
chocolate
note
lessens
a
roasted
malt
character
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
but
first
off
creamy
in
nature
full
flavored
the
entire
business
going
on
in
the
nose
is
mirrored
in
the
taste
as
well
this
is
really
nice
another
one
out
of
the
park
by
the
folks
at
dark
horse
big
thanks
to
bigdaddywil
for
the
opportunity
cheers
thanks
to
jjayjaye
for
the
experience
d
pretty
solid
this
is
a
step
up
from
one
easy
drinking
and
worth
checking
out
pours
a
sludgey
black
with
hints
of
brown
on
the
stream
of
pour
quickly
settles
to
an
ink
black
with
no
head
just
a
ripple
of
head
that
fades
as
you
pour
nose
is
dark
and
broading
with
hints
of
anise
toffee
and
smokey
sweet
burnt
malt
a
smokey
sweet
hue
creates
a
cloudy
smooth
feel
on
the
mouth
on
the
first
sip
rich
full
and
biscuit
like
flavor
graces
the
entire
tongue
hints
of
dryed
cherries
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
linger
around
on
the
mouthfeel
a
very
dry
but
not
obtrusive
bitter
is
there
also
a
nice
sipping
stout
for
those
who
enjoy
the
dark
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
milk
stout
d
pretty
high
on
alcohol
content
and
kind
of
bitter
i
give
it
an
average
rating
for
drinkability
d
a
solid
cream
stout
for
a
cold
winters
day
alcohol
is
not
too
high
to
be
much
of
a
factor
and
the
flavor
stays
enjoyable
throughout
tastes
just
as
smooth
as
it
smells
and
its
smooth
all
the
way
through
cant
stress
that
enoughits
like
silk
tastes
fairly
rough
though
and
the
clash
is
just
a
little
bit
offputting
theres
some
dark
chocolate
some
harshly
roasted
maltburnt
more
than
roastedand
a
decent
hop
finish
pretty
good
but
like
i
said
it
just
clashes
a
little
with
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
very
solid
cream
stout
a
very
drinkable
well
made
stout
flavor
is
quite
rich
and
satisfying
d
great
mouthfeel
but
the
smell
and
taste
arent
the
best
overall
a
great
rendition
of
the
style
although
this
stout
is
almost
a
year
old
its
been
cellaring
properly
and
undisturbed
to
say
the
least
i
likey
mucho
dark
horse
has
really
made
a
mark
on
the
midmichigan
micro
scene
whew
pours
near
black
in
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
surface
ring
around
the
top
of
the
body
aroma
consists
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
toffee
caramel
some
fruitiness
akin
to
raisins
and
some
alcohol
thats
buried
underneath
it
all
fullbodied
mouthfeel
thats
smooth
in
front
and
carbonated
toward
the
back
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
many
of
the
same
flavors
from
the
nose
are
layered
throughout
very
enjoyable
this
doesnt
quite
have
the
creaminess
of
a
milk
stout
as
it
plays
more
of
the
roasted
flavors
but
regardless
its
very
good
pours
a
midnight
onyx
black
with
a
half
finger
dark
tan
head
that
instantly
dies
down
to
just
about
nothing
well
the
just
about
nothing
leaves
nothing
on
the
sides
who
woulda
thunk
smell
is
a
rich
raspberry
chocolate
aroma
with
mild
oak
like
scents
black
french
roast
coffee
leaves
its
mark
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
malt
sweet
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
milky
caramel
malt
that
covers
the
french
roast
flavors
a
weak
smokey
flavor
is
present
throughout
entire
taste
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
with
a
cappuccinolike
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
almost
waterlike
but
with
more
density
no
bubbles
in
the
cheeks
at
all
no
kalamazoo
but
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
this
looks
like
some
really
thick
stuff
as
it
pours
pitch
black
color
thin
dark
brown
head
good
retention
and
lace
properties
the
aroma
is
pretty
damn
nice
some
of
that
smooth
oatyness
also
some
char
and
black
malt
goodness
on
the
nose
the
flavor
really
coats
the
tongue
thoroughly
big
rush
of
roasted
malt
goodness
mixed
with
some
dark
berries
and
anise
oil
cherries
come
to
mind
as
well
actually
more
like
bitter
cherry
chocolate
very
pleasing
flavor
profile
creamy
and
velvety
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
very
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
cream
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
served
in
a
shaker
pint
a
dark
stouty
blackbrown
with
a
brown
ring
of
head
odor
is
of
chocolate
and
cappuchino
not
too
complex
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
roasty
smooth
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
or
maybe
not
nice
overall
if
theres
something
lacking
its
that
the
sweetness
and
roasty
flavor
together
become
distracting
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
is
as
dark
as
black
can
be
with
a
niticable
lack
of
head
only
mustering
a
slight
ring
around
the
top
clarity
is
impossible
to
judge
and
there
is
no
visible
carbonation
in
the
beer
the
aroma
is
solid
roasty
malt
base
with
a
moderate
pineyness
and
a
lactic
acid
sharpness
apparent
when
i
take
a
deep
sniff
over
top
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
a
solid
and
nicely
bitter
roasted
malt
that
melds
into
a
creamy
lacto
sweetness
that
then
finishes
with
a
nice
ashy
roast
again
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
no
carbonation
it
has
a
mild
slickness
to
it
drinkability
is
fantastic
the
flavors
are
really
well
blended
i
like
how
the
heavy
roast
is
mellowed
by
the
lacto
character
this
is
a
nice
brew
cheers
d
this
is
the
kind
of
sweeter
stout
i
can
enjoy
in
the
summer
months
im
not
going
to
session
this
one
but
i
could
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
i
would
call
this
a
solid
sweet
stout
a
good
beer
but
one
would
be
enough
the
taste
does
get
a
little
much
after
one
got
this
one
in
a
trade
from
emerge077
and
id
like
to
thank
him
again
for
an
excellent
trade
it
included
a
dark
lord
this
one
pours
jet
black
with
a
very
dark
mocha
head
it
was
hard
to
determine
exactly
what
color
the
head
was
because
it
disappeared
very
quickly
roasted
malt
dominates
this
fairly
weak
aroma
and
is
backed
up
a
bit
by
some
coffee
the
flavor
is
predominated
by
dark
chocolate
but
it
is
too
bitter
there
is
some
coffee
in
the
background
some
astringency
that
is
present
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
cream
stouts
in
that
it
isnt
very
sweet
i
do
taste
some
lactose
in
there
i
believe
though
so
i
guess
the
style
is
correct
an
average
beer
all
around
d
i
couldnt
finish
it
bummer
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
little
tan
head
and
little
retention
aroma
is
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
sweet
malts
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
fruits
being
the
primary
components
very
creamy
mouthfeel
not
the
most
drinkable
cream
stout
from
michigan
but
a
very
solid
beer
now
that
im
halfway
through
the
one
too
tres
fore
series
of
dark
horse
stouts
i
have
to
say
that
im
impressed
too
is
easily
the
equal
of
one
and
is
so
drinkable
that
ive
finished
the
beer
before
finishing
my
review
something
that
doesnt
happen
very
often
snag
this
one
if
you
have
the
opportunity
its
excellent
beer
easily
one
of
the
darkest
beers
ive
ever
seen
dark
horses
cream
stout
pours
an
opaque
stream
of
oily
black
into
the
glass
steadily
raising
a
frothy
dark
brown
head
that
drops
shortly
to
a
wide
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
its
intensity
of
color
however
is
not
carried
over
into
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
nose
is
in
fact
more
fruity
with
a
berrylike
yeastiness
than
it
is
roasty
only
as
it
warms
does
the
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
character
begin
to
rise
the
mouthfeel
is
certainly
full
though
leaving
it
somewhat
viscous
supple
and
creamy
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
mild
veryfine
bubbled
natural
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
in
the
flavor
its
mainly
coffeelike
with
mild
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
but
no
sweetish
caramel
or
nuttiness
and
the
expected
harsh
and
bitter
super
deep
roastiness
like
an
ashtray
is
entirely
missing
this
is
actually
quite
smooth
and
rounded
theres
not
a
lot
of
complexity
to
it
but
it
is
rich
and
it
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
for
minutes
after
its
gone
quite
nice
a
great
cigar
beer
overall
a
good
stout
right
in
the
meaty
part
of
the
curve
one
is
good
for
me
its
a
rare
treat
d
very
different
for
the
style
not
surprisingly
dark
horse
chose
not
to
have
this
constrained
within
the
style
guidlines
very
bitter
and
tart
but
extremely
enjoyable
i
get
a
kick
out
of
the
unassuming
boring
white
labels
dark
horse
uses
it
is
a
great
contrast
to
the
liquid
gold
on
the
inside
slight
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
quickly
replaced
with
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
sugary
dark
fruits
dries
out
with
notes
of
coffee
baking
chocolate
and
peat
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
full
body
and
modest
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
bit
rougher
than
the
other
holiday
stouts
by
dh
but
still
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
clean
dark
brownblack
color
some
carbonation
no
head
or
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
sweet
roasted
malts
slight
vanilla
and
some
toffeecoffee
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
sweet
malty
and
a
nice
touch
of
toffeecoffee
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
milksweet
stout
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
check
this
brewery
out
this
is
my
first
but
i
do
have
another
from
them
and
hopefully
a
couple
of
others
coming
in
trade
recommended
ultra
drinkable
d
this
beer
has
a
pretty
light
thin
body
and
the
taste
is
pretty
dry
for
this
style
d
pretty
good
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
and
hearty
milk
stout
it
is
more
of
a
dessert
beer
but
one
could
session
it
i
suspect
the
abv
is
too
high
for
that
though
dark
horse
impresses
me
yet
again
i
should
note
that
this
might
have
had
a
really
strong
hop
profile
or
a
ton
of
bitterness
i
wouldnt
know
since
i
had
devil
dancer
a
few
hours
ago
overall
this
is
a
fine
if
unexceptional
stout
from
dark
horse
its
a
moderately
bitter
sweet
stout
with
all
the
right
elements
but
they
dont
really
come
together
all
that
well
this
was
a
good
beer
i
picked
up
a
few
singles
and
will
seek
out
a
full
6
pack
now
seems
to
hit
the
spot
if
you
want
something
sweet
after
dinner
and
want
a
beer
take
the
bottle
and
pour
it
deep
into
the
glass
and
when
the
last
bubbles
froth
and
foment
at
the
festering
fizz
top
shake
the
last
drips
of
the
bottle
onto
the
surface
of
the
beer
youll
see
little
bubbles
shoot
off
the
top
and
slide
like
electricity
to
the
glass
sides
and
die
there
this
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
beer
but
its
something
ive
noticed
from
doing
this
a
few
times
now
all
right
deep
hued
chocolate
coffee
smoke
burnt
wood
and
a
mild
sweetness
in
the
taste
of
the
dregs
at
the
roof
of
your
mouth
one
of
the
best
stouts
and
cream
stouts
ive
ever
had
opaque
black
color
just
as
every
single
dark
horse
stout
but
with
a
thin
and
quickly
diminishing
light
tan
head
espresso
and
chocolate
aromas
with
hints
of
vanilla
roast
and
brownies
quite
the
vibrant
little
blend
of
malt
aromatics
flavor
has
some
oxidation
just
like
the
aroma
but
this
is
also
a
2004
example
body
is
slightly
undercarbonated
and
it
is
thin
but
not
watery
slightly
bitter
and
astringent
malt
but
still
decadent
and
enjoyable
with
chocolate
and
cream
flavors
quite
the
treat
drinkability
quite
easy
drinking
damn
this
is
one
creamy
stout
they
say
its
brewed
with
real
milk
and
by
god
you
can
tell
not
much
of
a
head
i
guess
i
mean
none
really
just
like
their
oatmeal
stout
deep
deep
dark
in
color
the
mouthfeel
is
exquisite
i
dont
normally
like
melted
milkshakes
but
in
this
case
ill
take
it
strangely
enough
i
had
this
while
eating
a
slice
of
banana
cream
pie
now
i
normally
dont
care
much
for
banana
cream
pie
but
holy
cow
did
this
pairing
go
awesome
together
really
these
guys
can
make
some
stouts
doesnt
seem
to
have
as
much
of
the
dark
vinous
fruit
qualities
present
in
many
of
the
richer
stouts
instead
it
hones
in
on
the
interplay
between
the
roasted
malt
and
creamy
sweetness
and
nails
it
massive
coffee
and
malt
aroma
pours
deep
black
with
no
real
head
rich
dark
bakers
chocolate
flavors
followed
by
coffee
other
than
a
marked
lack
of
roastiness
this
doesnt
feel
like
a
sweet
stout
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
so
no
false
advertising
here
i
am
hoping
to
visit
this
brewery
soon
and
get
beer
fresh
from
the
tap
this
trio
was
from
corral
liquors
granite
city
ill
another
proof
the
michigan
has
perhaps
the
best
micro
breweries
anywhere
in
the
country
poured
out
to
a
flat
thick
black
color
of
day
old
coffee
nearly
no
head
or
carbonation
only
traces
of
dark
reddish
brown
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
beer
and
touches
of
lace
of
the
same
aromas
of
roasted
malts
wood
bourbon
and
a
definite
smoke
element
nice
taste
was
very
well
crafted
and
complex
flavors
of
earth
wood
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
spice
and
molassas
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
chewy
with
a
smoothness
to
it
that
is
almost
silk
like
a
good
level
of
drinkability
for
being
a
heavy
beer
like
it
is
a
recommended
brew
drinkability
is
nice
very
good
brew
from
the
bottle
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
aroma
sweet
dark
chocolate
coffee
caramel
cocoa
flavor
the
blend
of
the
chocolate
and
coffee
was
right
on
for
me
than
got
those
nice
roasted
malts
a
little
on
the
chaulky
side
but
good
this
is
the
2nd
dark
brew
from
dark
horse
i
have
had
got
one
more
to
go
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
apparently
they
dont
date
these
puppies
no
dating
pitch
chocolate
brown
with
a
bit
of
caramel
head
in
tight
form
that
mainly
was
a
thin
ring
and
a
tiny
dusting
just
in
the
center
deep
dark
and
rich
aroma
thick
and
heavily
scented
of
coffee
chocolate
and
hops
creamy
smooth
feeling
it
just
glides
along
your
tongue
schweet
carbonation
is
just
barely
present
in
the
background
wonderful
flavors
deep
and
dark
roasty
and
lovely
black
strong
coffee
vanilla
bean
bittersweet
chocolate
hoppiness
caramel
malts
such
good
flavors
and
feeling
in
this
nice
one
for
the
lovers
of
ports
and
stouts
as
it
has
a
lot
to
give
to
you
remarkable
for
its
easy
drinkability
especially
considering
the
color
easily
the
most
drinkable
of
the
dark
horse
black
biers
and
probably
the
lowest
in
alcohol
very
nice
i
like
a
nice
head
on
beer
but
everything
else
is
very
good
quality
milk
stout
not
top
of
the
pack
by
any
stretch
but
worthy
of
a
try
another
thanks
to
trbeer
for
setting
me
up
with
such
a
fine
display
of
brews
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
beer
a
solid
creammilk
stout
that
features
a
nice
lactose
bitter
taste
hope
im
not
lactose
intolerant
quite
good
and
one
id
have
again
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
midnight
black
with
two
fingers
of
dark
brown
head
not
tan
i
mean
brown
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
burnt
malt
chocolate
and
espresso
a
little
light
though
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
some
black
coffee
bitterness
it
is
rounded
out
by
a
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
finish
not
too
many
hops
present
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
as
well
not
a
bad
cream
stout
very
good
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
gives
some
life
to
an
otherwise
slightly
boring
midpalate
and
helps
lengthen
the
finish
my
hope
is
that
this
bottle
is
simply
a
bit
past
its
prime
regardless
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
picking
up
this
is
just
a
good
stout
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
very
dark
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
came
off
as
coffee
with
a
lot
of
cream
in
it
roasted
coffee
dominated
the
taste
lactose
or
milk
sugar
followed
chocolate
and
caramel
were
also
there
it
had
a
grainy
finish
that
mixed
with
the
creaminess
quite
enjoyable
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
realale
for
the
bottle
at
any
rate
this
thick
oily
completely
opaque
black
beer
forms
a
thin
ring
of
cinnamoncolored
bubbles
this
appears
to
be
an
imperial
stout
from
the
looks
of
it
the
aroma
is
potent
lots
of
strong
dark
coffee
maplesyrup
blackstrap
molasses
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
very
subtle
cologne
note
wow
mildly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
oily
with
a
firm
chewy
body
the
taste
starts
out
with
lots
of
french
roast
coffee
gobs
of
black
patent
and
roasted
barley
astringency
especially
in
the
finish
a
very
unique
whisky
character
with
some
phenolic
alcohols
and
potent
grains
becoming
evident
in
the
long
spicy
bitter
finish
dunno
what
the
abv
is
but
it
packs
a
punch
pleasantly
surprised
if
you
like
kzoos
stouts
try
this
pretty
good
coffee
stout
not
bad
for
an
everyday
offering
o
i
know
there
is
not
a
difference
really
in
a
stout
and
a
porter
but
if
i
were
to
define
it
id
say
this
would
be
a
porter
more
than
a
stout
i
think
the
thin
mouthfeel
would
classify
it
as
such
for
me
and
with
a
stout
itd
be
thicker
overall
its
a
good
beer
especially
if
your
looking
for
a
coffee
stout
im
not
disappointed
and
have
really
wanted
to
try
this
but
there
are
better
representations
of
this
style
on
the
market
alewerks
does
produce
some
really
good
beer
and
i
would
pick
those
over
this
in
their
lineup
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
is
has
the
chew
or
richness
i
really
want
in
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
great
flavors
of
malt
and
coffee
nicely
balanced
with
some
good
sweetness
very
nice
strong
taste
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
served
best
at
room
temperature
wonderful
expresso
aftertaste
wonderful
full
bodied
flavorful
beer
with
a
great
taste
from
beginning
to
end
pours
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
nice
with
hints
of
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
is
slightly
milder
than
i
anticipated
with
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
coffee
and
some
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
watery
which
i
have
found
a
lot
in
milk
stouts
overall
a
nicely
flavored
beer
with
the
good
creaminess
and
mouthful
of
a
milk
stout
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
low
enough
abv
to
be
just
about
sessionable
i
really
enjoy
coffee
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
definitely
glad
that
i
found
it
and
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
will
gladly
get
it
again
in
the
future
flight
size
at
the
brewery
im
not
a
big
milk
stout
fan
this
is
ok
pretty
decent
brew
full
flavored
and
easy
drinking
o
a
bit
disappointed
since
the
aroma
and
feel
are
both
there
but
the
flavor
just
does
not
deliver
im
actually
starting
to
believe
that
the
house
yeast
might
be
at
fault
here
since
ive
had
similar
experiences
with
other
beers
of
theirs
overall
a
great
cream
stout
and
one
i
enjoy
having
every
year
the
notes
really
feeel
and
taste
like
a
nice
cup
of
coffee
its
a
good
milk
stout
in
my
realm
a
style
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
but
its
not
overly
sweet
has
a
good
waffery
light
cookie
quality
and
chocolate
hints
strangely
though
of
all
the
things
it
should
hint
at
coffee
isnt
one
of
them
but
i
dont
care
it
drinks
well
either
way
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
expecting
as
much
sweetness
since
it
was
labeled
as
a
coffee
stout
it
is
classified
correctly
as
a
milk
sweet
stout
i
believe
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
with
a
touch
more
coffee
o
the
smell
on
this
one
was
deep
and
complex
the
flavor
seemed
to
linger
on
for
a
really
long
time
i
could
drink
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
rank
it
as
outstanding
just
a
good
solid
above
average
beer
o
you
dont
see
a
lot
of
coffee
flavored
milk
stouts
but
i
think
that
this
one
worked
well
the
sweetness
of
the
milk
stout
mixes
nicely
wight
he
bitterness
of
the
coffee
overall
very
nice
coffee
milk
stout
that
brings
a
nice
sweetness
on
the
backend
nice
va
local
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
a
tiny
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
and
more
coffee
and
slight
raisin
tastes
of
coffee
with
slight
fruit
taste
such
as
grapes
beer
is
a
tad
over
carbonated
but
light
bodied
and
finishes
well
overall
a
good
beer
bottle
as
an
awesome
extra
in
trade
thanks
first
virginia
rate
pours
black
with
a
small
light
brown
or
off
white
head
huge
coffee
aroma
just
like
a
cup
o
joe
some
lactose
like
sweetness
a
little
cocoa
roasted
malts
mmmm
flavor
is
very
espresso
forward
some
lactose
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
super
earthy
bitter
coffee
light
chocolate
and
roast
this
is
sweet
but
nicely
integrated
with
the
earthy
espresso
loving
the
coffee
and
lactose
sugar
combo
medium
mouthfeel
on
the
thinner
side
not
a
knock
as
this
isnt
an
impyplus
i
burned
the
shit
out
of
my
mouth
today
so
it
may
be
the
carbonation
on
the
burns
that
make
it
feel
thinner
as
it
is
super
smooth
and
rich
on
my
lips
and
given
the
low
abv
this
has
a
nice
body
going
on
with
a
nice
velvety
mouthfeel
there
is
some
nice
prickly
carbonation
on
this
dark
brown
pour
nearly
black
with
a
midsized
creamy
taupe
head
excellent
mocha
aroma
with
a
generous
measure
of
vanilla
mediumbodied
and
creamy
with
lazy
carbonation
the
flavor
is
a
sweet
medley
of
coffee
chocolate
crème
and
vanilla
bittersweet
mocha
finish
it
is
a
little
thin
but
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
o
despite
somewhat
lower
scores
i
see
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
relatively
low
abv
for
style
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
happily
go
through
several
of
these
in
an
evening
strong
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
some
cream
and
roasted
malt
chime
in
as
well
in
the
taste
coffee
bean
and
vanilla
cream
mild
leafy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
mostly
like
a
good
iced
coffee
getting
some
mocha
from
this
medium
bodied
feel
medium
carbonation
with
waning
retention
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
coffee
beer
i
will
have
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
one
try
and
i
was
hooked
during
a
one
week
visit
i
enjoyed
two
samples
and
two
pints
as
i
only
drink
on
occasion
this
is
my
limit
wanted
to
take
a
growler
home
and
would
have
if
i
wasnt
traveling
so
far
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
a
way
to
get
more
overall
i
would
give
it
a
b
pretty
good
overall
beer
the
only
deficiencies
i
felt
were
the
mouth
feel
and
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
little
more
head
retention
very
drinkable
o
silky
texture
makes
this
so
easy
going
down
with
a
roasty
freshness
makes
this
a
must
try
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
brewery
this
is
a
little
different
a
coffee
stout
that
tastes
like
actual
coffee
not
roasted
espresso
aromas
but
the
bitter
eye
opening
drip
coffee
taste
it
makes
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
big
high
abv
stouts
and
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
residual
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
bitter
dark
surprise
coffee
color
light
lacing
high
points
for
originality
but
not
necessarily
a
worldchanger
o
good
coffee
stout
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
with
the
combination
of
low
abv
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
a
hair
thin
but
still
substantial
enough
a
very
pleasant
drink
overall
i
may
have
had
better
impressions
with
a
fresh
batch
since
this
was
bottled
on
113
a
few
months
may
have
really
impacted
the
deep
coffee
flavor
that
might
have
been
in
this
beer
may
try
it
again
sometime
down
the
road
i
like
my
coffee
black
and
my
beer
to
have
a
decent
malt
presence
so
coffee
stouts
are
generally
right
in
my
wheelhouse
this
one
makes
a
fine
but
common
first
impression
with
the
pour
producing
a
deep
nearlyblack
brown
color
but
it
is
topped
by
only
a
fine
wisp
of
a
coffeefoam
head
the
aroma
drastically
improves
my
expectations
with
a
rich
roasty
icedcoffee
aroma
over
more
subtle
notes
of
bittersweet
cocoa
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
lets
me
down
though
by
being
surprisingly
sweet
compared
to
the
aroma
with
a
heavy
caramel
malt
backbone
that
overwhelms
the
roast
and
coffee
characteristics
the
texture
likewise
detracts
with
a
lowlevel
of
carbonation
that
results
in
a
moderately
syrupy
feel
that
further
enhances
the
sweetness
overall
the
beer
showed
promise
but
the
oversweetness
and
undercarbonation
were
harmful
flaws
to
the
experience
nice
coffee
tones
more
of
a
mellow
ride
than
a
blast
in
the
mouth
consistent
which
i
appreciate
since
a
lot
of
coffee
beers
seem
to
drop
off
too
quickly
feels
good
going
down
though
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
excessive
at
certain
points
nice
drinker
liked
this
one
black
with
a
very
fine
point
rim
of
light
tan
foam
black
mirror
atop
otherwise
smells
of
coffee
cocoa
more
coffee
and
pretty
much
just
cold
coffee
flavor
is
coffee
soil
some
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
bread
some
bits
of
unsweetened
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
a
little
less
body
and
a
little
much
carb
for
the
style
overall
decent
quite
a
bit
of
coffee
which
makes
it
one
dimensional
o
this
is
a
very
satisying
milk
stout
that
ill
have
again
another
solid
offerring
from
aleworks
o
pretty
solid
once
i
realized
this
wasnt
designed
to
be
a
coffeebomb
fbs
killer
i
could
appreciate
its
subtleties
a
lot
more
thoroughly
hardly
my
favorite
coffee
beer
but
good
enough
where
id
considering
getting
a
6
pack
of
in
the
future
the
best
milk
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
after
ma
kessons
triple
stout
from
england
was
retired
very
smooth
and
no
bitter
aftertaste
the
coffee
from
guatemala
is
an
excellent
choice
to
flavor
this
coffee
stout
along
with
the
cocoa
flavor
not
too
high
of
an
alcohol
content
either
just
right
excellent
o
very
good
coffee
stout
not
overpowering
with
the
coffee
but
rather
blended
in
nicely
i
had
been
looking
to
buy
some
new
stouts
to
try
and
a
friend
of
mine
told
be
to
pick
this
one
up
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
a
very
average
to
good
stout
if
your
looking
for
something
a
little
different
dont
look
here
a
little
flat
when
it
came
to
taste
and
feel
they
could
do
better
by
adding
something
to
give
it
more
of
a
kick
thin
with
almost
no
head
and
i
couldnt
really
taste
any
of
the
coffee
notes
it
was
more
sour
than
sweet
average
is
the
key
word
im
a
fan
of
coffee
stouts
and
this
one
although
passable
is
not
in
the
upper
tier
of
this
style
this
is
an
excellent
stout
great
tasting
and
goes
down
too
easy
overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
i
cant
say
ive
every
had
a
coffee
milk
stout
nice
7
910
if
you
arent
a
coffee
fan
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
not
bad
coffee
was
pretty
subdued
except
in
the
aroma
i
actually
like
the
lactosemilk
chocolate
notes
better
than
the
coffee
o
guatemala
needs
to
be
noted
by
craft
breweries
who
want
to
pump
out
a
sweet
and
savory
coffee
stout
the
antigua
coffee
beans
put
a
new
characteristic
into
this
brew
that
is
hard
to
parallel
its
one
of
my
favorite
light
stouts
on
the
market
and
the
bonus
factor
goes
to
that
its
only
an
hour
from
me
keep
pumping
out
the
stouts
alewerks
they
far
surpass
anything
else
you
make
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
silky
on
the
tongue
pretty
impressive
for
a
milk
stout
especially
with
the
coffee
adding
a
completely
new
dimension
to
the
profile
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
is
worth
a
look
at
10
a
six
pack
o
i
really
liked
this
one
and
it
makes
me
anxious
to
try
to
the
cafe
royale
definitely
would
recommend
if
you
are
into
milk
stouts
o
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
i
like
it
pretty
well
for
a
lower
abv
stout
first
beer
i
have
enjoyed
from
this
brewery
of
course
i
have
yet
to
taste
cafe
royale
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
easy
to
drink
could
use
a
little
bit
more
coffee
flavor
if
its
calling
itself
a
coffeehouse
stout
o
this
is
no
doubt
the
best
low
abvless
than
7
abv
coffee
stout
ive
had
to
date
it
tastes
like
a
mini
breakfast
stout
with
a
milkier
body
outstanding
overall
a
nice
coffee
stout
recommended
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
slightly
smooth
and
creamy
decent
enough
mouthfeel
not
too
big
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
primarily
the
aroma
and
first
tasting
but
was
left
feeling
like
it
could
have
been
better
again
the
flavor
seems
to
vanish
too
quickly
leaving
you
wanting
something
more
a
definite
recommendation
for
coffee
fans
though
glad
i
got
to
try
another
williamsburg
beer
i
cant
thank
hanzo
enough
o
a
good
milk
stout
coffee
is
very
strong
in
the
aroma
but
more
balanced
in
the
flavor
sweet
as
it
should
be
but
nicely
balanced
with
some
more
bitter
flavors
this
brewery
has
made
another
casked
realale
called
chocolatte
that
blew
this
one
out
of
the
water
hope
they
begin
to
brew
it
regularly
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
though
not
my
favorite
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
some
time
next
to
some
of
my
favorites
just
for
fun
i
mixed
a
little
half
half
in
with
the
last
couple
of
ounces
like
i
would
with
a
strong
cup
of
coffee
it
actually
helped
overall
a
very
drinkable
evening
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
well
into
the
spring
especially
for
all
of
you
fellow
devout
stout
fans
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
to
without
having
to
overthink
anything
about
the
beer
one
was
plenty
for
me
glad
to
tick
another
brewery
this
is
among
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
if
not
the
best
with
cafe
royale
selling
out
so
quickly
its
nice
to
have
this
beer
available
as
well
since
it
actually
sits
on
the
shelves
for
a
couple
weeksmonths
during
the
winter
id
like
to
see
the
brewer
pump
this
offering
up
into
a
double
it
would
have
the
potential
to
be
outstanding
if
williamsburg
kicked
it
up
a
notch
seek
this
out
with
haste
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
really
really
good
williamsburg
alewerks
surprises
me
again
first
surprise
was
their
pumpkin
ale
with
another
solid
beer
o
a
pretty
decent
coffee
stout
overall
it
smells
great
though
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
the
aroma
still
its
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
overall
if
youre
looking
for
a
coffeeforward
beer
i
would
say
that
this
one
is
slightly
above
average
the
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
for
me
and
detracted
overall
o
i
have
enjoyed
every
brew
that
ive
tasted
from
williamsburg
alewerks
and
this
one
continues
that
trend
while
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
are
solid
the
smell
is
definitely
the
highlight
for
me
i
have
never
been
one
to
drink
coffee
but
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
get
sick
of
this
aroma
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
certainly
try
again
and
one
thats
getting
me
excited
to
try
another
alewerks
offering
cafe
royale
the
beer
is
a
really
deep
opaquee
brownblack
the
smallish
head
is
mocha
colored
and
substaining
to
a
degree
aroma
is
rich
black
coffee
beans
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
cream
from
the
lactose
probably
maybe
some
bittersweet
chocolate
the
sweetness
of
the
lactose
in
this
milk
stoudt
help
to
mellow
out
the
acidic
bitterness
i
like
that
the
coffee
essence
smells
like
fresh
roasted
coffee
beans
instead
of
black
coffee
richly
roasted
malts
add
to
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
milky
creaminess
it
drinks
smooth
with
a
velvetty
thickness
pretty
good
beer
more
towards
a
sipper
or
desert
say
with
a
creame
burlee
o
sweet
and
easy
drinking
with
plenty
of
coffee
notes
to
go
around
this
is
an
excellent
sweet
stout
a
decent
session
ale
for
those
who
like
their
stouts
sweet
and
also
like
coffee
this
could
go
well
in
a
vanilla
milkshake
or
with
some
muffins
blueberry
would
be
interesting
for
some
flavor
contrast
o
overall
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
it
tastes
more
like
coffee
than
anything
unfortunately
it
feels
overcarbonated
but
thats
about
it
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
but
its
a
tossup
it
tastes
more
like
a
coffee
stout
than
it
did
last
year
but
it
has
a
sodalike
carbonation
which
makes
it
hard
to
drink
o
a
solid
likeable
drinkable
beer
really
overall
its
pretty
good
but
could
use
a
little
more
i
would
buy
a
sixer
probably
would
be
a
nice
warm
weather
dark
brew
i
dont
know
a
ton
about
coffee
but
i
do
know
my
palate
and
these
harsh
coffee
stouts
do
not
agree
with
me
maybe
a
different
batch
would
be
better
especially
because
i
have
liked
all
of
the
other
williamsburg
stuff
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
says
coffee
smells
of
coffee
and
tastes
of
coffee
my
love
of
coffee
may
have
me
biased
to
think
highly
of
this
beer
but
wow
i
really
like
it
i
truly
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
this
tm
burnt
malts
and
strong
coffee
honestly
i
find
it
kind
of
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
though
and
too
thin
to
hold
its
own
o
man
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
im
seriously
impressed
and
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
ever
tried
by
williamsburg
alewerks
ill
be
sure
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
in
the
next
few
weeks
4
5
o
this
is
a
very
high
quality
fairly
low
octane
coffee
brew
that
is
definitely
amongst
the
best
ive
tried
in
its
style
class
nicely
done
its
nice
not
offthewall
or
outstanding
but
definitely
nice
decent
for
the
price
point
too
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
the
nose
taste
and
carbonation
are
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
heavier
but
it
doesnt
detract
it
has
a
pleasant
appearance
over
its
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
this
one
again
delicious
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
coffee
to
it
and
a
touch
less
sweet
but
i
like
my
coffee
black
not
loaded
with
cream
and
sugar
so
maybe
thats
why
im
not
completely
sold
that
being
said
id
definitely
seek
this
one
out
if
i
could
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
smooth
there
is
very
little
carbonation
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
do
to
the
lower
alcohol
and
very
well
balanced
flavors
d
very
tasty
and
an
easy
drinker
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
the
alewerks
and
definitely
one
that
i
think
could
compete
at
a
national
level
poured
a
dark
brownish
black
with
a
small
tannish
head
pretty
standard
coffee
stout
aroma
dark
malts
coffee
dark
chocolate
basic
coffee
stout
taste
as
well
following
the
aroma
with
roasty
malts
coffee
slightly
bitter
creamy
sweetness
not
quite
fullbodied
but
still
nice
and
smooth
and
very
drinkable
good
selection
d
i
was
pleasantly
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
of
the
two
bottles
i
bought
there
was
a
noticeable
amount
of
variation
the
first
was
spectacular
while
the
second
was
only
above
average
maybe
it
was
something
i
ate
on
the
day
of
the
latter
pours
a
near
black
color
with
quick
rush
of
bubbly
brown
head
gone
quickly
leaving
little
spots
smell
combined
notes
of
spent
coffee
grounds
and
melted
semisweet
and
milk
chocolate
not
the
best
notes
individually
but
pleasant
taste
brings
an
initial
dry
and
roasty
coffee
character
but
it
is
quickly
covered
up
by
notes
of
mocha
and
chocolate
fudge
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
solid
creamy
feeling
combines
with
a
light
powdery
quality
a
nice
sweet
stout
with
some
quality
flavor
notes
overall
a
solid
coffee
beer
definitely
worth
trying
though
if
you
can
afford
it
bells
java
and
fbs
are
going
to
be
much
better
options
for
the
coffee
beer
lover
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
12
inch
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
spots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
rich
chocolate
syrup
chocolate
bars
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
of
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
covered
in
chocolate
syrup
a
nice
roasted
coffee
bean
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
still
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
though
12oz
bottle
from
grape
gourmet
pours
slightly
thick
and
utterly
black
as
night
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
and
sheet
lacing
aroma
blew
me
away
huge
dark
roasted
coffee
praline
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
flavor
was
amazing
as
well
and
truly
matched
the
aroma
tastes
of
rich
black
coffee
dark
chocolate
sweet
caramel
and
hints
of
vanillawith
a
lingering
bitter
coffee
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
watery
which
is
the
only
true
knock
on
this
beer
overall
a
delicious
brew
like
a
poormans
breakfast
stout
geoff
is
certainly
doing
solid
work
at
alewerks
and
if
this
one
is
any
indication
i
cant
wait
for
the
new
brewmasters
series
update
new
batch
from
january
2010
wow
has
this
one
gotten
even
better
much
more
expressolike
on
the
nose
and
the
flavor
boasts
new
subtleties
of
toffee
cinnamon
graham
cracker
and
ash
the
palate
which
may
have
been
a
bit
thin
in
the
first
batch
is
much
silkier
and
rich
on
the
tongue
great
work
geoff
o
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
i
love
the
massive
dose
of
coffee
o
nice
enjoyable
beer
wishing
the
taste
was
a
little
more
bold
but
tasty
none
the
less
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
deep
rich
looking
black
color
theres
a
decent
brown
head
that
comes
and
goes
within
a
few
minutes
there
is
a
light
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
coffee
there
isnt
too
much
else
happening
on
the
nose
here
the
taste
is
semi
sweet
upfront
but
fades
into
a
burnt
toast
bitterness
with
a
lot
of
coffee
throughout
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
overall
check
it
out
you
may
like
it
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
first
ive
had
from
this
brewery
solid
and
worth
a
try
i
prefer
both
the
left
hand
milk
stout
and
the
lancaster
milk
stout
to
this
offering
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
its
not
bad
its
not
cloying
or
overly
sweet
its
just
not
what
i
expected
given
how
it
was
labeled
if
youre
being
introduced
to
coffee
stouts
for
the
first
time
or
find
them
to
be
too
bitter
or
over
the
top
usually
this
is
probably
right
up
your
alley
however
if
youre
like
me
and
want
a
coffee
stout
thats
big
bold
and
has
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
to
it
pass
this
one
by
d
a
good
offering
nice
job
this
is
not
really
doing
it
for
me
its
too
sweet
especially
at
the
finish
kind
of
a
onedimensional
beer
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
slightly
coffee
flavored
beer
this
wouldnt
be
bad
but
it
is
no
where
near
an
a
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
some
richness
problems
o
very
nice
brew
does
everthing
as
expected
needs
more
robust
flavor
profile
to
be
considered
elite
overall
a
really
awesome
brew
that
exemplifies
an
underrated
brewery
will
drink
many
times
in
the
future
and
will
definitely
recommend
to
everyone
drinks
well
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
after
dinner
type
beer
notes
nothing
extraordinary
but
rather
quaffable
the
coffee
itself
without
being
extraordinary
feels
good
and
adequate
and
all
in
all
it
comes
together
nicely
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
in
particular
in
light
of
some
recent
flops
with
coffee
stouts
poured
nearly
jet
black
except
for
a
garnet
tinge
in
the
bottom
of
the
glassa
one
finger
mocha
colored
head
that
was
gone
in
a
flash
atopa
well
formed
head
it
just
didnt
stick
around
at
all
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffeevanillaand
light
bitter
chocolatenot
much
earthiness
wich
i
expected
if
this
wasnt
a
milk
stout
i
would
have
given
it
a
lower
taste
score
because
its
quite
sweet
after
awhilestarting
out
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
they
are
soon
taken
over
by
sugary
sweet
lactose
notes
in
a
long
finish
to
me
it
gets
too
sweet
after
mid
glass
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
good
oyeah
we
all
like
this
one
a
lot
i
would
like
a
few
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
smell
is
weak
and
has
a
subtle
coffee
smell
the
taste
isnt
heavy
but
is
sweet
at
first
then
the
coffee
flavors
finish
could
use
some
more
carbonation
but
its
flavorfull
overall
is
good
stout
different
and
deffenlty
worth
a
try
o
very
enjoyable
quality
craft
beer
and
it
is
a
local
which
makes
it
even
better
very
nice
sweet
coffee
stout
could
easily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cool
evening
like
tonight
get
it
the
flavor
is
not
quite
good
as
the
nose
but
is
quite
extravagant
the
chocolate
is
layered
and
reminds
me
of
virtually
everything
chocolaterelated
that
i
could
possibly
enjoy
loads
of
chocolate
cake
and
a
good
amount
of
coffee
as
well
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
lovely
with
lowish
levels
of
carbonation
love
love
love
the
fact
that
this
is
only
5
4
abv
damn
is
this
drinkable
and
overall
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
o
drinkable
but
this
bottle
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
draft
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
the
best
part
of
the
taste
is
the
chocolate
and
malt
which
is
quite
plentiful
downside
is
the
coffee
which
can
be
overpowering
and
also
the
flat
nature
of
the
beer
it
just
misses
on
mouthfeel
overall
this
one
is
fine
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
d
with
such
a
tasty
taste
and
sweet
mouthfeel
on
top
of
a
6
brew
this
is
a
great
session
stout
with
lots
of
flavor
im
digging
this
newer
label
what
with
the
faux
wax
seal
and
all
fancy
the
beer
inside
pours
a
deep
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
ashyecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
a
sweet
coffee
mixed
with
a
velvety
rich
dark
chocolate
some
roasted
malts
a
clear
prerequisite
as
per
usual
finish
things
up
in
the
back
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
small
amount
of
maple
syrup
in
there
as
well
just
sayin
the
taste
leans
a
bit
more
toward
the
chocolate
end
but
the
coffee
remains
staunch
as
ever
its
a
very
simple
combination
but
its
done
to
near
perfection
here
very
tasty
the
body
is
a
sleek
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
straight
up
the
cpj
skål
pours
black
as
night
with
a
small
shortlived
tan
head
the
nose
offers
a
heavenly
blend
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
the
flavors
are
good
and
largely
consistent
with
the
nose
and
also
feature
roasty
notes
and
perhaps
more
sweetness
than
the
aromas
suggested
starts
out
with
a
lot
of
coffee
and
then
finishes
sweet
and
cocoalike
medium
full
body
is
appropriate
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
beer
d
this
had
a
fantastic
coffee
scent
and
taste
but
weak
body
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
ultimately
only
really
good
it
would
have
been
among
the
top
of
the
style
if
it
had
fuller
body
still
definitely
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
the
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
appreciate
coffee
as
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
prevalent
however
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
d
some
coffeefeaturing
stouts
seem
a
little
thin
beneath
the
coffee
character
but
thankfully
this
has
a
nice
chocolate
and
lightly
fruity
background
presence
as
a
result
we
get
a
balanced
appropriately
sweet
approachable
stout
i
would
definitely
drink
again
if
i
were
to
visit
virgina
as
a
coffee
drinker
myself
i
liked
the
way
this
tasted
and
would
buy
again
drinkability
if
you
like
coffee
beer
then
you
should
enjoy
this
one
quite
well
it
is
an
easy
drinking
good
coffee
stout
with
a
nice
low
abv
i
will
say
upfront
that
this
beer
surprised
me
with
being
as
good
as
it
was
i
looked
at
other
reviews
in
advance
along
with
my
thoughts
on
alewerks
in
the
first
place
decent
but
nothing
special
this
beer
poured
a
sexy
looking
black
abyss
into
the
glass
topped
off
by
a
wonderful
brown
foam
that
had
decent
head
retention
the
smell
was
of
quality
coffee
and
you
can
tell
from
stout
to
stout
which
one
was
made
with
burnt
leftover
gas
station
coffee
and
who
uses
the
premium
stuff
this
is
premium
stuff
aside
from
the
obvious
coffee
aroma
there
was
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
perhaps
some
nutmeg
the
taste
was
quality
like
the
aroma
but
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
much
sweeter
than
i
take
my
coffee
but
im
putting
this
beer
on
par
with
the
cw
brewhouse
coffee
stout
this
thing
is
up
in
that
pantheon
for
coffee
stouts
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slick
with
the
standard
medium
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
that
most
stouts
should
have
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
take
down
i
wish
i
had
this
around
me
at
all
times
but
alas
i
have
to
hope
for
it
in
extras
if
you
see
it
buy
it
its
that
good
and
usually
im
pretty
picky
as
to
what
stouts
i
find
to
be
quality
d
decent
sweet
coffee
flavor
but
not
much
else
to
recommend
it
impression
i
am
sure
to
try
and
get
this
again
buy
this
if
you
see
it
quite
tasty
above
average
for
sure
glad
i
have
another
bottle
d
great
drinkability
there
was
an
excellent
balance
of
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
throughout
this
is
a
great
coffee
beer
and
im
glad
its
local
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
coffee
stout
and
is
not
too
sweet
or
dry
im
almost
curious
if
one
were
to
let
this
go
flat
then
heat
in
a
microwave
you
could
pass
it
to
someone
and
they
would
think
it
was
just
a
fresh
cup
of
good
coffee
overall
id
buy
a
6pack
of
this
to
have
a
respectable
coffee
beer
around
good
ones
like
this
are
hard
to
find
d
solid
coffee
stout
although
its
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
still
there
is
enough
of
a
coffee
presence
to
please
overall
this
was
a
nice
introduction
to
this
brewery
d
its
tasty
but
not
great
the
coke
thing
puts
me
off
a
bit
but
for
a
super
drinkable
coffee
stout
its
pretty
solid
d
i
think
i
could
have
this
one
for
breakfast
i
enjoyed
the
coffee
presence
in
the
beer
they
were
strong
and
straight
forward
the
only
reason
i
didnt
score
it
higher
was
because
of
the
slight
lactic
flavor
i
was
picking
up
coffeehouse
stout
has
great
coffee
character
but
lacks
the
kind
of
feel
that
makes
great
stouts
memorable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
medium
bodied
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
heavy
carbonation
is
moderate
probably
about
the
maximum
id
like
it
to
be
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
found
it
to
be
an
excellent
beer
overall
the
sweetness
of
the
milk
stout
mixed
with
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
perfectly
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
more
then
i
anticipated
going
in
and
really
think
its
one
of
the
best
coffee
flavored
beers
ive
had
d
one
or
two
max
i
found
that
this
was
very
very
filling
d
loaded
with
flavor
a
relatively
low
abv
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
a
williamsburg
alewerks
offering
d
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
well
not
dangerously
since
the
abv
is
low
but
you
get
the
point
really
really
good
easily
drinkable
d
one
of
the
few
beers
that
ive
had
from
these
guys
but
this
one
sort
of
missed
the
mark
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
must
say
poured
a
dark
as
night
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
definitely
had
some
big
coffee
notes
with
burnt
char
slight
oatmeal
grians
and
faint
chocolate
notes
the
taste
has
more
chocolatey
flavor
mixing
real
good
with
the
coffee
notes
alongside
roasty
burnt
char
and
oatmeal
grain
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
roasty
burnt
char
slight
astringent
and
silky
finish
the
beer
was
more
roasty
and
smokey
than
anticipated
but
still
drank
decent
i
still
think
it
would
have
had
a
better
balance
if
it
had
more
chocolate
flavors
d
wishing
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
bottle
right
about
now
a
solid
milk
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
on
a
long
time
d
definitely
could
have
this
breakfast
no
doubt
great
beer
but
its
main
down
fall
is
that
the
flavor
could
have
been
richer
love
it
could
drink
a
6
pack
easily
if
the
flavor
had
been
a
bit
more
complex
i
would
say
it
would
have
been
up
there
with
surly
coffee
bender
pours
a
light
black
into
a
pint
glass
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
coffee
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
again
mostly
coffee
its
very
sweet
but
not
very
heavy
certainly
a
tasty
beer
and
because
of
the
light
body
i
could
drink
several
at
a
time
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
coffee
stout
the
bottle
went
down
much
too
quickly
great
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
well
balanced
with
a
smooth
body
williamsburg
has
a
winner
on
their
hands
with
this
brew
one
of
the
best
sessionable
coffee
stouts
ive
had
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
minimal
head
what
head
there
is
is
a
chocolate
milk
color
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
beer
is
brewed
with
roasted
guatemala
antigua
coffee
and
the
aromas
of
that
are
pretty
evident
in
the
nose
other
aromas
include
chocolate
vanilla
and
leather
strong
coffee
flavor
to
this
one
for
sure
pretty
much
just
like
drinking
an
iced
coffee
bitterness
throughout
medium
mouthfeel
not
the
best
coffee
stout
our
there
but
definitely
a
solid
performer
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
was
very
surprised
at
the
flavor
i
have
heard
horror
stories
about
williamsburg
ale
works
beers
but
every
one
i
have
tried
so
far
has
been
fantastic
i
am
really
falling
in
love
with
this
small
brewery
i
think
their
current
beers
could
easily
take
on
the
top
breweries
in
the
us
this
is
a
wonderful
coffee
stout
plenty
of
coffee
without
tasting
like
cold
carbonated
coffee
very
enjoyable
d
pretty
darn
good
id
like
more
coffee
roast
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
still
good
and
very
drinkable
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
felt
it
was
packed
with
great
character
while
being
easy
to
drink
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
overall
a
very
good
stout
if
youre
looking
for
a
flavorsome
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
i
enjoyed
this
d
i
enjoy
this
beer
its
great
for
breakfast
or
after
dinner
drinkability
straightforward
coffee
i
rather
like
that
in
this
beer
d
i
could
easily
settle
in
for
a
night
and
have
a
good
number
of
these
the
coffee
is
the
highlight
and
definitely
is
what
carries
this
beer
big
surprise
given
the
name
d
went
back
at
least
3
times
to
drink
this
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
at
the
beer
fest
coffee
was
never
over
powering
great
balance
would
love
to
see
this
barrel
aged
ala
kbs
mouth
and
drink
are
both
really
good
i
could
drink
a
few
there
is
some
bitter
astringent
in
the
finish
but
not
much
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
with
some
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
deep
scent
with
roastd
grains
and
a
noticable
coffee
aroma
good
taste
a
nice
stout
with
roasted
grain
flavors
a
bit
too
much
coffee
for
me
and
it
did
have
some
astringency
went
down
fine
if
slightly
dry
tastes
strikes
a
much
different
balance
however
sweet
lactose
maltiness
screams
milk
stout
and
combines
with
the
roasty
coffee
to
provide
a
frappaccinoesque
tasting
beverage
very
rich
very
creamy
and
nearly
decadent
chocolate
both
dark
and
milk
are
there
aplenty
packs
a
helluva
lot
of
flavor
for
a
5
4er
interesting
and
tasty
beer
but
probably
could
only
tank
one
in
any
given
sitting
d
smells
and
tastes
like
an
8
imperial
stout
but
drinks
like
a
common
english
sweet
stout
this
one
is
very
very
quaffable
and
deserves
a
place
in
the
mainstream
market
d
a
pretty
good
stout
had
a
nice
sweet
vanilla
taste
that
mixed
well
with
the
coffee
would
try
it
again
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
the
aroma
rings
like
a
bell
clear
and
crisp
and
coffeelike
it
smells
exactly
like
a
wellroasted
dark
bean
cracked
with
a
hammer
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
strongly
authentically
coffeeish
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
like
an
extreme
dark
roasted
cafe
au
lait
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
are
in
excellent
balance
the
coffee
flavor
perfectly
counterpoised
with
the
roasted
malt
this
is
an
excellent
coffeebased
beer
great
pick
up
a
pint
or
12
wow
i
poured
this
black
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
opaque
and
poured
a
really
dark
head
the
smell
was
like
pecan
pith
the
beer
tasted
like
coffee
it
had
great
lacing
but
tasted
like
coffee
very
dry
mouthfeel
if
you
like
cold
coffee
you
will
like
this
i
did
not
overall
i
think
id
enjoy
one
of
these
as
a
regular
beer
out
at
the
pub
with
the
lads
but
more
than
that
would
be
way
too
much
and
i
also
think
its
complexity
and
nuances
would
be
lost
and
wasted
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
with
a
sipper
a
nightcap
a
dessert
beer
it
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
well
worth
trying
dark
pour
with
minimal
head
smells
strongly
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
coffee
aroma
taste
is
good
very
good
smooth
coffee
flavor
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
softer
than
most
coffee
beers
not
too
much
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
a
decent
stout
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
high
not
an
overwhelming
coffee
flavor
very
smooth
not
too
strong
of
an
abv
a
sessioncoffeestout
fairly
thick
and
yet
simultaneously
light
bodied
something
like
a
soda
that
gone
the
teensiest
bit
flat
which
sounds
unpleasant
but
felt
appropriate
pretty
easy
drinking
m
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
a
tasty
example
of
a
coffee
stout
and
loaded
with
flavour
yet
it
still
manages
to
be
a
fairly
light
bodied
smooth
and
a
little
slick
with
a
sparkling
carbonation
quite
good
i
just
wish
their
seasonals
were
available
in
individual
sixpacks
as
its
one
id
like
to
pick
up
alone
from
time
to
time
drinkability
good
the
rare
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
ruin
your
tastesbuds
so
you
can
keep
drinking
it
or
have
something
else
single
bottle
from
grape
gourmet
virginia
beach
va
drinkability
is
extremely
high
such
huge
taste
but
pretty
low
abv
highly
recommended
especially
for
anyone
who
likes
stouts
brewed
with
coffee
the
best
thing
from
williamsburg
alewerks
that
ive
tasted
i
wonder
if
its
because
of
the
new
head
brewer
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
a
real
good
find
i
would
drink
this
again
had
it
on
tap
so
the
initial
pour
looked
fantastic
but
by
the
time
i
made
the
30
walk
back
to
the
table
the
head
completely
disappeared
decent
legs
but
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
carried
a
little
bourbon
but
wasnt
an
overwhelming
aroma
taste
is
where
this
thing
wins
and
i
guess
all
that
really
matters
right
never
had
a
more
balanced
ba
stout
ever
bourbon
was
certainly
there
but
not
overwhelming
little
to
no
heat
at
all
and
not
cloyingly
sweet
just
a
damn
fine
tasting
beverage
period
other
than
being
a
little
thin
this
is
a
little
jackpot
of
a
beer
a
very
enjoyable
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
fit
its
style
as
much
as
id
like
aroma
of
coffee
vanilla
mild
bourbon
wood
malt
taste
sweet
creamy
coffee
malt
vanilla
faint
bourbon
oak
chocolate
nice
o
great
offering
of
a
sweetmilk
style
its
not
cloying
and
really
lets
all
the
flavors
shine
through
great
barrel
notes
on
this
beer
just
beware
of
aging
seems
like
there
are
other
reports
of
sourness
beyond
mine
draft
pours
dark
black
with
creamy
brown
head
think
lingers
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
good
italian
coffee
taste
good
strong
espresso
coffee
with
chocolate
cinnamon
and
vanilla
something
bitter
buried
deep
best
taste
is
the
strong
espresso
heavy
stout
no
carbonation
strong
espresso
and
malt
aftertaste
smooth
though
very
drinkable
like
it
as
much
or
better
than
evil
twin
donut
break
very
good
imperial
stout
fantastic
flavor
from
start
top
finish
i
felt
this
particular
batch
was
slightly
under
carbonated
as
it
produced
very
little
head
when
poured
pretty
good
sweetmild
stout
that
is
worth
trying
really
a
beer
to
get
excited
about
if
you
see
it
i
think
this
is
an
absolute
homerun
for
the
boys
out
of
williamsburg
last
time
i
got
this
bottle
i
liked
it
so
much
i
cellared
one
for
about
14
months
it
was
still
very
good
when
i
opened
it
but
lost
some
of
the
vibrancy
and
balance
that
make
this
beer
and
i
didnt
think
the
mellowed
flavors
were
an
improvement
nor
worth
the
wait
i
may
still
stock
up
but
it
wont
be
for
the
long
hall
overall
its
not
bad
at
this
point
and
the
tartness
might
even
be
seen
as
somewhat
pleasant
but
i
cant
imagine
this
was
intentional
definitely
something
starting
to
take
over
here
which
is
unfortunate
as
id
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
something
id
like
to
try
again
sometime
but
not
this
particular
batch
o
this
one
definitely
flies
under
the
radar
its
got
more
coffee
than
bourbon
but
it
balances
out
very
well
lucky
to
occasionally
find
this
one
on
the
shelf
this
beer
is
just
a
superb
balance
of
roasted
malts
bourbonbarrel
flavors
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
it
gets
better
and
better
as
it
goes
down
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
and
while
a
tad
thin
in
mouthfeel
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
enjoyment
at
all
i
have
a
bottle
for
aging
so
ill
give
that
a
try
to
see
what
it
does
for
the
sweet
flavors
outstanding
bottle
from
trade
with
ken
thanks
pours
black
with
a
half
finger
creamy
mocha
head
aroma
of
bourbon
earthy
coffee
chocolate
oak
a
bit
heavy
on
the
sharp
bourbon
smell
flavor
is
roast
up
front
a
little
sweet
lactose
with
a
straight
bourbon
finish
not
much
coffee
to
taste
there
isnt
much
else
going
on
here
velvety
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
overall
i
am
psyched
i
got
to
try
this
but
these
lighter
stouts
and
porters
just
cant
stand
up
to
the
bourbon
i
cant
get
into
this
one
meh
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
and
cream
brown
head
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
chocolate
black
and
appears
a
little
slick
on
the
surface
the
beer
smells
tend
to
be
distinct
but
mix
very
well
the
smells
vary
from
milk
chocolate
bourbon
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
note
as
well
the
alcohol
note
is
very
minor
but
the
bourbon
smell
is
fairly
strong
compared
to
the
other
notes
however
the
milk
chocolate
taste
takes
over
it
as
it
warms
up
the
taste
is
a
different
from
the
smell
in
that
the
bourbon
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
the
milk
chocolate
taste
actually
dominates
the
tongue
instead
with
the
bourbon
complementing
the
taste
other
slight
notes
include
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
taste
as
well
the
beer
feels
surprisingly
smooth
such
that
it
also
feels
creamy
and
heavy
bodied
overall
a
pretty
good
sweet
stout
and
worth
getting
when
its
available
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
was
decent
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
all
the
advertised
flavors
are
present
in
equal
levels
but
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
it
memorable
o
loved
it
wish
i
could
have
bought
more
but
the
2013
vintage
is
already
sold
out
fully
expect
that
this
beer
will
be
sought
out
nationwide
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
done
to
style
loads
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
goes
down
very
smooth
hints
of
oak
and
bourbon
as
it
warms
definitely
a
well
done
stout
and
one
to
seek
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
coffee
and
chocolate
coffee
is
more
subdued
and
played
well
thanks
davetreat
for
the
opportunity
to
revisit
o
a
definite
after
meal
sipper
a
pretty
darn
good
one
too
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
mocha
head
the
smell
is
sweet
bourbon
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
starting
out
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
finishing
with
coffee
undertones
and
a
sweet
bourbon
finish
this
is
where
the
fact
that
its
a
barrel
aged
milk
stout
really
comes
out
solid
brew
doug
and
i
were
both
very
impressed
with
this
one
its
a
beer
where
the
barrel
treatment
makes
a
definite
contribution
but
still
allows
the
base
beer
and
its
adjuncts
to
stand
out
this
was
a
delicious
beer
with
a
lot
of
depth
highly
recommended
if
you
enjoy
milk
stouts
after
awhile
and
plenty
of
swirling
the
carbonation
died
down
and
the
mouthfeel
became
medium
heavy
with
a
really
nice
finish
this
also
allowed
for
more
of
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
to
come
through
bumped
the
mouthfeel
from
2
25
to
3
5
since
the
issue
was
present
and
the
flavor
up
from
4
to
4
5
overall
a
really
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
coffee
stout
with
a
light
bourbon
influence
the
coffee
adds
a
really
great
flavor
and
is
elevated
by
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
barrels
a
really
nice
surprise
and
awesome
value
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
coffee
stouts
highly
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
m
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
loose
lacing
and
a
thin
tan
halo
of
head
the
nose
is
a
potent
caramel
sweetness
upfront
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
little
coffee
or
booze
the
taste
is
obviously
great
caramel
sweetness
upfront
with
a
hint
of
bitter
roasty
coffee
and
very
little
bourbon
roundedout
chocolatey
fullbodied
smooth
sweetness
without
bitterness
or
booze
defines
this
potent
coffee
ba
milk
stout
id
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
but
think
it
lacks
the
bourbon
and
coffee
ive
come
to
expect
with
its
worldclass
drinking
status
sweet
smooth
and
decadent
this
raises
the
bar
for
sweet
stouts
o
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
drinking
experience
its
not
an
overly
complex
beer
and
i
didnt
think
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
stood
out
that
much
but
the
beer
works
as
a
whole
to
me
that
is
more
important
than
any
gimmick
or
process
used
to
make
the
beer
this
one
just
tastes
wonderful
im
definitely
going
to
get
another
of
these
correction
im
going
to
buy
several
more
of
these
for
future
consumption
this
beer
is
awesome
i
had
heard
good
things
about
it
but
this
is
a
great
combination
of
coffee
and
bourbon
kmwith
a
nice
tan
head
awesome
nose
coffee
stuck
out
huge
with
a
touch
a
bourbon
drank
really
smooth
lots
of
flavour
and
thr
perfect
beer
with
derby
pie
huge
chocolate
and
cofee
of
course
loves
this
beer
great
for
desserts
its
an
amazing
beer
all
around
great
smells
a
little
complexity
in
the
taste
and
drinkable
this
is
probably
the
best
milkcoffee
stout
hybrid
ive
ever
had
its
a
great
compliment
to
the
flavors
and
style
this
turned
out
exceptionally
well
and
drinks
like
nothing
one
of
the
easiest
barrel
aged
stout
beers
to
drink
ive
ever
had
after
note
i
am
not
a
milk
stout
fan
so
that
says
something
right
there
overall
this
is
delicious
why
this
isnt
more
hyped
up
im
not
sure
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
o
again
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
im
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
overly
sweet
brews
even
for
a
milk
stout
its
definitely
above
average
in
that
category
is
that
a
byproduct
if
the
lactose
or
barrel
8
610
o
a
nice
overall
beer
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
has
good
coffee
flavor
a
nice
sweetness
and
hints
of
bourbon
it
reminds
me
of
a
baby
bcbcs
o
for
everything
i
wish
had
changed
about
this
beer
i
still
think
its
outstanding
for
a
milk
stout
probably
my
second
or
third
favorite
ive
ever
had
for
this
style
4
5
opaque
black
appearance
which
fades
to
a
reddish
mahogany
around
the
rim
pours
with
little
head
but
nice
lacing
aromas
open
with
vanilla
coffee
and
then
a
distinct
bourbon
note
that
contains
oak
and
more
vanilla
initial
tastes
of
vanilla
and
coffee
bean
then
finishing
with
bourbon
and
bitter
chocolate
mouth
feel
is
viscous
but
not
overly
syrupy
and
some
nice
effervescence
keeps
it
from
being
too
heavy
other
than
the
bourbon
notes
this
does
not
taste
overly
alcoholic
and
is
very
drinkable
a
great
brunch
beer
or
with
or
for
dessert
after
dinner
o
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
alewerks
has
really
outdone
themselves
with
this
beer
the
beer
completely
changes
notes
once
its
warmed
up
which
i
think
is
for
the
better
the
bourbon
compliments
the
sweet
vanilla
and
chocolate
notes
perfectly
even
though
im
not
a
huge
bourbon
fan
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
these
other
bottles
age
my
only
issue
with
the
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
the
base
beer
feels
amazing
but
the
bourbon
flavors
translate
into
a
strong
upfront
bite
that
is
the
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
virginia
whale
delivered
by
blackie
really
a
decadent
beer
lots
of
fudge
layered
chocolate
cake
cookie
dough
chocolate
covered
espresso
bourbon
hazelnut
brown
sugar
luminescent
of
an
iced
cappucino
or
something
other
sugarjacked
starbucks
creation
this
one
drinks
dangerously
easy
but
after
a
few
servings
youll
likely
need
to
be
screened
for
diabetes
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
could
have
had
more
coffee
intensity
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
a
bit
more
chocolate
depth
and
longer
barrel
aging
could
also
have
improved
this
brew
the
hop
additions
were
acceptable
but
could
have
been
slightly
more
bitter
for
my
taste
overall
just
freaking
great
surpassed
lefthands
milk
stout
which
i
never
thought
would
happen
well
worth
the
time
and
money
fantastic
beer
the
2012
version
was
drank
on
tap
at
the
tasting
room
and
had
a
great
balance
of
bourbon
and
flavor
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
stouts
i
have
had
recently
excited
to
try
it
out
of
the
bottle
as
this
beer
tasted
so
good
on
draft
cheers
cafe
royale
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
nice
to
have
in
your
backyard
with
easy
access
to
a
very
delightful
stout
that
any
stout
lover
should
try
and
get
a
ho
smooth
and
remarkably
soft
on
the
palate
not
too
sweet
with
the
years
worth
of
aging
mellow
sweetish
nightcap
great
as
a
dessert
by
itself
would
also
be
good
with
a
cheese
plate
to
bring
out
the
lactose
a
bit
more
probably
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
and
the
bourbon
is
assertive
yet
mellow
smells
great
and
drinks
like
a
dream
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
o
café
royale
was
a
total
sleeper
hit
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
knew
what
to
expect
the
second
time
around
and
this
complex
beer
still
surprised
me
with
loads
of
nuances
and
depth
masterfully
blended
the
barrel
aging
adds
quite
a
bit
to
the
beer
a
dessert
treat
to
be
sure
this
is
one
beer
you
dont
want
to
miss
o
this
is
a
beer
for
the
candy
addicts
and
those
with
a
major
sweet
tooth
its
good
but
its
way
too
sweet
for
me
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
this
again
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
little
fizzy
dark
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
lot
of
chocolatetoffee
nice
little
bourbon
note
and
a
very
nice
touch
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
lots
of
dark
stuff
going
on
here
slight
bourbon
note
medium
body
pretty
complex
brew
really
overall
this
one
really
surprised
me
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
dick
overall
a
choice
alternative
to
kbs
at
half
the
price
o
very
good
ba
stout
with
all
around
great
characteristics
sits
right
behind
surly
four
as
far
as
milk
stouts
go
well
received
by
this
guy
williamsburg
alewerks
is
2
for
2
in
my
book
recommended
for
milk
stout
fans
very
highly
recommend
this
brew
pours
a
jet
black
hue
with
a
thin
head
that
recedes
quickly
absolutely
zero
lacing
the
smell
on
this
is
robust
but
sweet
a
nice
combination
of
roasted
coffee
and
vanilla
intermingling
with
some
nice
bourbon
notes
the
taste
is
all
coffee
all
the
time
nice
and
roasty
malty
with
a
load
of
sweet
vanilla
the
bourbon
is
completely
absent
in
the
taste
which
is
unfortunate
fortunately
the
rest
of
the
flavors
pick
up
the
slack
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
such
is
life
with
porters
otherwise
its
quite
smooth
with
just
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
coffee
overall
this
is
solid
im
not
a
fan
of
porters
as
a
rule
of
thumb
but
this
is
awesome
bottle
generously
shared
by
a
friend
poured
into
a
pint
glass
huge
coffee
and
bourbon
aroma
smell
also
contains
some
yellow
cake
batter
coconut
and
smooth
rich
malt
taste
is
rich
sweet
malt
tempered
by
coconut
bourbon
and
coffee
this
beer
is
average
when
compared
to
the
other
coffee
beers
on
market
overall
fantastic
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
has
plenty
of
character
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
puppy
this
is
an
enjoyable
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
i
think
i
read
that
they
age
this
in
seconduse
bourbon
barrels
this
gives
cafe
royale
the
pleasant
character
ofwood
bourbon
without
overpowering
the
many
great
layers
of
well
integrated
flavors
d
very
well
done
beer
big
coffee
notes
mingle
well
with
the
bourbon
should
try
harder
to
get
this
when
it
releases
next
year
bottle
to
oversized
tulip
thanks
to
ksurkin
for
this
one
looks
good
black
with
thin
lacing
smells
good
too
malty
and
bourbony
tastes
very
good
i
like
how
the
bourbon
flavors
married
with
the
milk
stout
i
had
my
concerns
about
this
mouthfeel
is
good
would
improve
with
age
overall
a
tasty
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
o
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
and
i
was
nonplussed
with
my
first
few
sips
as
it
warmed
though
it
really
opened
up
and
wowed
me
a
very
unique
brew
that
is
more
than
just
a
coffee
or
barrel
aged
stout
the
milky
lactic
finish
really
makes
this
stand
apart
it
drinks
much
like
its
namesake
id
swear
i
was
having
an
iced
mocha
from
starbucks
with
a
pinch
of
bourbon
here
here
for
a
beer
well
done
edit
i
liked
the
second
bottle
i
had
a
lot
more
bourbon
character
came
out
more
in
the
aroma
and
taste
overall
feel
was
smoother
body
was
fuller
dont
know
what
they
did
different
in
this
batch
but
it
bumped
the
rating
right
up
from
a
4
0
to
a
4
25
easily
thanks
to
pdeepak
for
the
share
i
knew
this
would
focus
coffee
but
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
balanced
out
with
a
stronger
bourbon
barrel
presence
good
but
to
me
this
was
just
more
of
a
thinner
coffee
stout
without
much
more
to
it
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
drinks
very
nicely
and
the
coffee
and
barrel
flavors
arent
too
overboard
this
poured
out
as
a
thick
black
looking
brew
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
fades
rather
quickly
just
leaving
a
foamy
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
pretty
impressive
lots
of
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
coffee
notes
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
notes
with
some
sweet
roasted
malty
caramel
and
coffee
to
bitter
it
out
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
feeling
with
a
light
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
im
starting
to
like
williamsburg
alewerks
more
and
more
the
cafe
royale
milk
stout
is
fantastic
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
easy
of
course
it
is
a
rather
heavy
beer
but
delicious
it
drinks
so
easy
that
i
anticipated
it
having
a
very
low
abv
and
pleasently
suprised
to
see
that
it
is
an
8
beer
williamsburg
makes
solid
beers
and
this
on
is
right
up
there
with
their
best
thick
chewy
full
bodied
great
carbonation
its
a
delightful
beer
typical
dark
black
stout
minimal
head
smell
is
of
bourbon
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
nuts
in
the
background
as
well
a
little
chocolate
flavor
is
bourbon
vanilla
chocolate
all
somewhat
subtle
but
blending
together
nicely
slightly
sweet
silky
and
slick
but
not
oily
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
a
nice
different
take
to
have
a
milk
stout
that
is
barrel
aged
and
it
works
nicely
o
i
totally
agree
with
the
williamsburg
alewerks
website
when
it
says
cafe
royale
is
a
high
octane
version
of
our
coffeehouse
stout
the
balance
of
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
is
very
well
done
allowing
the
coffee
chocolate
milky
sweetness
bourbon
and
hops
to
blend
together
almost
perfectly
having
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
i
thought
the
bourbon
flavoraroma
would
come
through
more
than
it
actually
does
however
this
doesnt
disappoint
me
at
all
as
i
prefer
the
bourbon
to
not
steal
the
spotlight
of
the
beer
overall
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
thats
brewed
right
here
in
the
state
of
virginia
it
may
not
be
until
next
year
but
when
i
see
this
beer
again
i
am
stocking
up
thumbs
up
an
enjoyable
and
tradeworthy
brew
slightly
chewy
medium
body
with
a
good
balance
of
roasted
coffee
bourbon
oak
and
dark
malt
the
barrel
character
is
well
integrated
into
the
beer
without
becoming
a
one
dimensional
bourbon
bomb
decent
amount
of
sweet
bourbon
flavor
without
much
heat
as
well
as
some
vanilla
and
dry
toasted
oak
that
meshes
very
well
with
the
coffee
flavor
deep
and
roasted
without
ever
approaching
acridburnt
or
harsh
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
countering
the
coffee
flavor
hints
of
lactic
sugar
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
oatmeal
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
mid
palate
but
overall
this
beer
is
really
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
could
use
a
bit
more
bourbon
but
still
pretty
impressive
o
alewerks
does
some
really
nice
brews
but
i
think
this
is
their
crowning
accomplishment
for
you
traders
ive
heard
that
multiples
of
this
one
trades
for
some
brewery
only
releases
cool
o
a
very
enjoyable
well
done
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
recommended
a
great
coffeesweet
stout
with
very
subtle
barrel
aging
one
of
the
more
interesting
flavor
profiles
ive
found
for
the
style
3
5
d
good
but
not
as
impressive
as
the
reputation
in
all
honesty
this
is
pretty
much
average
through
and
through
like
3
0
average
but
my
love
of
milk
stouts
and
barrel
aging
has
kicked
it
to
the
upper
limit
of
average
o
this
is
damn
tasty
and
the
abv
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
i
would
stock
up
on
this
one
if
it
was
available
to
me
locally
highly
recommended
overall
just
as
advertised
loads
of
bourbon
and
coffee
with
a
lot
of
booziness
awesome
beer
that
we
all
enjoyed
thick
oozing
amount
of
coffee
sweeter
aroma
and
just
one
of
the
fullest
smells
i
have
ever
come
across
in
my
life
lots
of
lactose
in
here
as
well
with
hints
of
sweet
roasted
coffee
just
stronger
then
anything
you
could
possibly
imagine
the
flavor
followed
suit
perfectly
sweet
coco
lots
of
carbonation
here
never
let
go
and
never
had
a
dull
moment
to
it
you
could
literally
drink
this
one
all
night
long
hot
very
warming
in
the
throat
not
bad

pours
a
silky
thick
black
with
a
full
twofinger
dark
beige
head
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
leaving
beautiful
lacing
aroma
is
utterly
fantastic
with
big
woody
bourbon
notes
at
the
outset
that
settle
beautifully
into
the
background
of
huge
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
cake
vanilla
and
light
coconut
with
subtle
touches
of
dark
fruit
and
toffee
flavor
is
spectacular
and
im
a
homer
so
its
perfect
with
an
absolutely
flawless
balance
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
mocha
with
a
light
creamy
lactosweetness
sliding
through
ahead
of
smooth
oak
vanilla
and
spicy
bourbon
with
a
long
ashy
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
finish
palate
is
sublimely
full
bodied
silky
smooth
and
damn
near
milkshakeesque
creamy
with
perfect
carbonation
and
incredible
drinkability
overall
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
five
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
bravo
geoff
rerate
aww
hell
this
brew
is
just
getting
better
and
better
every

just
a
thin

band
around

nose
expresses
roast

a

some

mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
consistency
with
an
even
carbonation
from
start
to
finish
not
mild
but
not
quite
prickly
a
decent
brew
didnt
realize
it
was
a
milk
stout
but
not
much
of
the
barrel
is
present
overall
i
found
it
fairly
tasty
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
fairly
easy
to
get
down
wouldnt
mind
it
again
and
im
not
a
milk
stout
fan
though
i
initially
wrote
this
off
as
a
pleasant
but
unremarkable
sweet
stout
the
bourbon
qualities
of
this
beer
make
it
more
interesting
im
not
sure
of
this
bottles
vintage
but
i
imagine
it
could
benefit
from
a
touch
more
aging
though
i
worry
the
coffee
flavors
would
fade
accordingly
all
in
all
this
is
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
bal
aged
stout
that
id
be
interested
in
trying
again
o
d
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
beautiful
brown
with
a
nice
reddish
tint
a
touch
of
light
tan
head
very
very
pretty
with
a
reddish
tint
smells
phenomenal
lots
of
coffee
and
a
light
bourbon
hint
on
the
nose
smells
sweet
with
lots
of
milk
sweetness
on
the
nose
taste
is
similar
coffe
milk
sweet
sugary
goodness
and
bourbon
but
light
and
perfect
for
the
base
beer
this
is
a
damn
near
perfect
beer
overall
impression
incredibly
easy
to
drink
right
on
jet
black
pour
with
a
solid
fingers
worth
of
mocha
head
coffee
and
bourbon
dance
across
my
nose
this
beer
is
sweet
and
pleasantly
so
coffee
and
chocolate
and
of
course
some
bourbon
this
beer
is
very
smooth
everything
played
very
well
here
enjoyable
a
really
nice
one
the
coffee
bourbon
and
creamy
vanilla
are
all
wonderfully
integrated
graciously

robert
pours
a
solid
dark
black
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
looks
kinda
lifeless
but
there
is
some
carbonation
bubbles
popping
up
along
the
edges
fantastic
aroma
of
dark
and
milk
chocolate
lactose
roast
and
coffee
which
is
probably
slightly
mellowed
because
of
the
age
wow
this
thing
taste
amazing
loaded
with
rich
milk
chocolate
lots
of
sweetness
a
touch
of
lactose
twang
molasses
caramel
and
loads
of
coffee
which
are
much
more
prevelant
than
what
the
nose
suggested
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
bourbon
notes
but
there
is
a
touch
of
vanilla
toasty
nuttiness
in
the
background
just
an
allaround
well
rounded
taste
everything
mingles
together
perfectly
absolutely
tasty
medium
bodied
close
to
full
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
and
wish
i
could
many
more
bottles
of
this
thanks
again
robert
o
this
one
completely
blew
me
away
i
figured
it
would
be
good
but
not
this
good
o
nice
beer
very
easy
to
drink
felt
like
the
flavor
was
missing
a
little
omph
though
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
again
to
get
it
and
i
think
their
coffee
stout
is
better
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
i
was
hoping
to
net
one
o
these
bad
boys
before
leaving
nova
but
the
release
was
painfully
delayed
just
to
screw
with
me
or
so
the
voices
tell
me
thankfully
awesome
bas
populate
bifs
this
bit
o
haul
pours
a
pure
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
oak
whiskey
blackened
pretzels
rather
light
roasted
malts
and
a
layer
of
char
some
chocolate
syrup
comes
in
if
you
inhale
deeply
enough
the
taste
also
focuses
on
the
whiskeydrenched
oak
with
some
light
chocolate
syrup
light
roasted
malts
and
very
light
molasses
backing
that
up
dont
get
me
wrong
this
shit
is
good
its
just
dominated
by
the
barrels
the
body
is
on
the
heftier
side
of
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoothly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
solid
stout
though
i
think
if
the
stout
characteristics
were
enhanced
to
further
counterbalance
the
barrels
it
would
truly
shine
edit
memorial
day

across
the
board
his
the
spot
even
on
a
warm
sunny
day
overall
this
is
among
the
best
coffee
stouts
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
who
can
say
no
to
a
barrel
aged
imperial
vanilla
coffee
milk
stout
i
sure
cant
and
im
glad
i
didnt
this
beer
pours
a
black
liquid
into
the
glass
initially
has
a
sandy
froth
on
the
top
but
that
doesnt
stay
around
too
long
it
smelled
darn
tasty
from
the
descriptor
above
you
can
assume
that
there
was
a
distinct
coffee
and
vanilla
presence
there
wasnt
really
any
milk
stout
aroma
due
to
the
strong
aroma
of
the
roasted
malts
the
simplicity
of
roast
and
vanilla
together
for
some
reason
is
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
smells
in
beerdom
to
me
the
flavors
resemble
a
smooth
iced
coffee
with
a
distinct
oak
and
vanilla
flavor
to
it
this
is
coffee
with
creamer
mind
you
i
felt
for
the
strength
of
this
beer
that
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
but
it
wasnt
bad
in
the
slightest
my
overall
opinion
of
this
beer
is
that
if
it
was
thickened
up
i
would
never
be
able
to
get
enough
of
the
beer
as
it
currently
stands
its
not
that
doesnt
slight
this
beer
in
any
way
this
is
a
damn
tasty
brew
and
should
be
appreciated
by
more
individuals
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
nice
medium
size
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
very
nice
aromatic
coffee
notes
with
some
light
bourbon
notes
and
light
vanilla
taste
is
a
very
smooth
mix
of
bourbon
and
aromatic
coffee
with
well
rounded
roasted
malt
with
light
vanilla
and
bourbon
finish
body
is
quite
full
with
nice
creamy
texture
and
some
good
carbonation
very
well
brewed
with
great
balance
and
easily
drinkable
while
being
quite
complex
at
the
same
time
okay
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
coffee
flavor
and
aftertaste
i
just
wasnt
blown
away
with
this
beer
a
bit
sweet
even
for
the
style
pour
is
pitch
black
with
little
hint
of
any
carbonation
head
is
a
solid
12
cm
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
smell
is
of
fresh
coffee
and
vanilla
pretty
tame
but
elegant
vanilla
and
coffee
blend
seamlessly
together
with
the
roasted
malts
toffee
and
chocolate
combine
with
the
vanilla
and
coffee
and
hit
your
palate
with
a
complex
array
of
flavors
that
beg
you
to
want
more
slight
bitterness
toward
the
finish
this
is
a
sipper
that
goes
down
easy
its
not
heavy
but
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
into
the
medium
body
carbonation
is
moderate
to
low
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
had
there
are
a
handfull
over
cafe
royale
still
but
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
id
gladly
drink
more
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
thin
bread
head
some
mild
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
coffee
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
i
only
notice
a
trace
of
the
bourbon
in
this
but
it
is
there
a
really
smooth
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
imperial
stout
or
not
since
the
abv
isnt
listed
but
it
doesnt
taste
boozy
i
really
enjoyed
this
radeks
bottle
d
a
great
beer
experience
all
around
abv
not
listed
on
the
bottle
but
this
did
not
strike
me
as
boozy
or
excessive
still
not
a
session
beer
but
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beeer
2010
bottle
in
the
fridge
about
a
year
now
pours
a
nice
deep
mahogany
brown
light
peeks
through
around
the
edges
and
not
much
head
is
generated
the
thin
tan
foam
quickly
subsides
but
the
beer
is
definitely
still
alive
aromas
are
of
bourbon
and
wood
faint
coffee
wafts
underneath
the
roasted
wood
and
mellow
boozy
front
taste
is
rich
and
chewy
good
balance
with
sweet
chocolatey
malt
and
a
tingling
bourbon
finish
that
leaves
a
nice
coating
on
the
tongue
the
booziness
is
well
diguised
by
the
rich
sweet
malt
and
the
finish
lingers
of
ground
coffee
and
a
bourbon
heat
best
cellarable

i
have
found

from
some
wf
awhile
back
drinkability
this
is
the
second
time
having
this
beer
the
first
being
about
a
month
after
the
release
wasnt
blown
away
by
the
coffee
flavor
then
either
a
bit
sweet
even
for
the
style
but
otherwise
its
pretty
good
there
is
enough
going
on
to
keep
one
engaged
i
distinctly
remember
enjoying
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
more
bottle
variation
im
getting
some
syrupy
cherry
here
but
in
an
coffe
rather
than
a
fruit
way
a
bit
sweet
maybe
for
some
but
its
nice
to
see
coffee
flavor
without
too
much
of
a
roasted
chocolate
flavor
worth
seeking
out
as
a
different
take
from
the
way
others
approach
the
style
very
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
thick
with
good
carbonation
level
great
beer
from
williamsberg
alewerks
somewhat
light
bodied
and
creamy
with
moderatelow
carbonation
unsure
of
the
abv
on
this
but
its
an
easy
drinker
d
an
exquisite
offering
from
the
folks
at
williamsburg
alewerks
a
brewery
that
continues
to
impress
me
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
good
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
wordly
this
is
also
a
wonderful
example
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
i
highly
recommend
and
look
forward
to
attempting
to
grab
some
more
for
myself
didnt
know
what
to
expect
here
but
not
bad
at
all
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
good
as
other
beers
of
this
style
like
kbs
not
a
ton
of
bourbon
flavor
either
a
great
bourbon
beer
this
needs
more
distribution
another
homerun
from
this
up
and
coming
brewery
this
is
a
nice
stout
big
booze
flavorful
roasted
malt
sweetness
mixed
in
im
all
over
this
d
i
shared
some
of
this
but
i
could
have
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
impressive
considering
the
sweetness
i
think
it
really
helps
that
everything
else
is
so
subtle
including
the
abv
just
a
really
nice
beer
here
this
is
a
big
beer
that
doesnt
shun
balance
smooth
with
a
medium
viscosity
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
without
the
burn
of
many
other
bourbon
barrel
stouts
additionally
the
abv
is
reasonable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
but
i
would
not
go
into
it
expecting
a
super
boozy
bourbon
barreled
beer
i
also
really
like
the
fact
that
this
is
still
a
milk
stout
and
retains
the
coffeehouses
sweetness
d
pretty
enjoyable
imperial
stout
nothing
that
really
wows
me
about
it
but
good
wish
i
could
have
picked
up
a
bit
more
of
the
oak
and
whiskey
though
d
very
balanced
id
love
to
keep
drinking
this
blackened
with
a
mocha
head
appealing
but
typical
of
the
style
coffee
and
creamy
sweetness
are
prominent
on
the
nose
theres
a
ton
of
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
it
smells
very
sweet
for
the
relatively
low
abv
the
coffee
character
isnt
reminiscent
of
freshly
roasted
beans
like
founders
breakfast
stout
its
more
like
brewed
coffee
perhaps
a
bit
stale
smelling
in
contrast
and
somewhat
acidic
its
coffee
forward
on
the
tongue
but
equally
sweet
and
quite
creamy
the
combination
of
coffee
and
milky
sweetness
makes
me
think
of
one
of
those
syrupladen
starbucks
espresso
drinks
bourbon
barrel
aging
has
contributed
a
ton
of
vanilla
though
little
oak
or
heat
its
a
mellow
beer
very
sweet
but
not
particularly
heavy
the
finish
is
mild
creamy
and
never
quite
dries
up
this
is
solid
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
clearly
wellmade
beer
the
bourbon
is
wellintegrated
and
the
flavors
mesh
well
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
anytime
good
job
alewerks
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
end
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
very
nice
coffee
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
to
it
everything
really
came
together
very
nicely
in
it
im
really
looking
forward
to
see
how
this
develops
in
the
future
another
very
good
barrel
aged
beer
from
williamsburg
that
i
enjoyed
greatly
d
a
bit
bourbon
heavy
but
good
i
wouldnt
have
believed
it
but
this
is
a
routinely
good
barrel
aged
big
coffee
stout
i
had
no
idea
that
this
being
existed
in
the
wild
very
good
beer
the
similarity
to
the
eclipse
continues
on
the
palate
initially
a
little
sweet
more
vanilla
honey
and
brown
sugar
than
the
caramel
that
the
eclipse
the
similarity
ends
here
as
the
coffee
dominates
rich
fruity
and
quite
espressolike
chocolate
and
cocoa
are
present
as
well
working
quite
well
with
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
not
really
tannic
this
beer
finishes
a
little
sweet
with
vanilla
and
caramel
unfortunately
this
is
just
a
little
bit
watery
on
the
finish
but
the
flavors
are
quite
excellent
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderatelow
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
excellent
recommended
highly
recommended
pours
a
rich
deep
dark
near
black
with
thin
cap
of
mocha
head
leaving
great
lacing
scent
is
of
dark
roasted

with
faint

notes

chocolate
and
fainter
notes
of
alcohol
and
oak
full
bodied
creamy
and
silky
smooth
slightly
coating
excellent

of
carbonation
a
fantastic
tasting
brew
although
its
not
overly
complex
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
doesnt
add
as
much
as
in
other
brews
it
is
one
of
the
better
coffee
tasting
beers
out
there
thanks
to
shane
injuredreserve
for
graciously
sharing
with
me
d
probably
nice
with
chocolate
cake
id
like
about
8oz
in
a
sitting
but
its
great
for
sharing
although
i
didnt
get
much
barrel
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
will
seek
more
sometime
soon
overall
a
good
local
seasonal
that
ill
pick
up
again
lots
of
bitterness
from
the
coffee
and
the
forward
sweetness
from
the
bourbon
eh
as
far
as
bourbon
barrel
beers
go
its
kind
of
mediocre
otherwise
its
a
decent
beer
d
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
that
integrated
the
coffee
with
the
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
nicely
it
was
bold
and
complex
with
nice
body
and
a
clean
taste
it
was
a
little
hot
fresh
so
it
was
better
to
sip
but
age
could
help
mellow
this
out
reminiscent
of
kbs
id
love
to
try
them
side
by
side
along
with
the
wa
bourbon
barrel
porter
the
porter
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
group
m
a
really
good
brew
and
shows
that
williamsburg
alewerks
can
put
out
the
big
brews
with
the
best
of
them
their
everyday
beers
need
the
same
kind
of
attention
to
push
them
up
a
level
or
two
but
this
brew
and
grand
illumination
barleywine
are
both
excellent
examples
of
their
respective
styles
and
well
worth
finding
and
giving
a
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
slight
break
on
the
price
tag
would
be
nice
for
a
local
brew
but
all
in
all
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
that
approaches
blue
mountains
dark
hollow
for
a
quality
imperial
stout
a
little
more
roast
edge
and
this
would
compete
with
kbs
pour
brings
a
nearblack
liquid
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
has
some
pretty
good
staying
power
this
is
definitely
a
coffee
bombthe
nose
really
loads
in
some
nice
fresh
coffee
that
is
fairly
dark
and
roasty
the
taste
scales
the
coffee
down
a
tad
bit
in
exchange
for
some
dry
roast
and
hints
of
chocolate
feel
is
quite
nice
this
is
somewhat
thick
but
dry
and
roasty
finishes
well
i
havent
had
that
many
beers
from
williamsburg
at
this
point
although
the
ones
i
have
tried
have
been
quite
good
overall
a
pretty
solid
coffee
stout
the
coffee
is
fresh
and
the
bourbon
shows
enough
but
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
it
is
pretty
drinkable
as
well
this
was
a
fun
one
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
it
bottle
courtesy
of
dregs78
from
ba
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
semidark
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
dark
roast
coffee
leather
and
slight
bourbon
notes
the
booze
notes
that
i
do
pick
up
i
think
can
be
contributed
to
the
aging
in
barrels
some
lace
as
the
head
settles
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
the
bourbon
flavor
is
fairly
evident
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
nice
blend
of
flavors
the
dark
chocolate
is
mor
evident
at
the
end
and
lingers
on
for
a
while
slgith
warming
and
taste
of
alcohol
as
well
overall
a
really
nice
beer
with
some
pretty
good
balance
i
really
like
the
bourbon
flavors
in
that
they
arent
too
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
as
well
great
brew
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
in
va
or
md
for
me
id
be
hard
pressed
to
describe
why
id
spend
2
5
times
more
for
the
beloved
bcbcs
when
this
is
just
as
tasty
and
much
more
drinkable
as
a
milk
stout
should
be
seriously
drinkability
is
good
a
lot
of
flavor
not
much
of
an
alcohol
blast
and
very
smooth
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
not
ten
fidy
or
the
abyss
but
it
goes
down
a
lot
easier
than
these
beers
there
are
times
when
i
want
a
less
intense
but
still
flavorful
stout
this
would
do
it
d
pretty
good
for
dessert
if
it
was
any
warmer
outside
i
would
not
be
drinking
a
pint
i
think
a
touch
less
sweetness
would
go
a
long
ways
here
still
an
excellent
boubon
barrel
aged
coffee
stout
although
fleeting
in
feel
for
a
stout
cafe
royale
was
remarkably
delicious
with
more
unique
flavor
notes
than
ive
tasted
in
any
beer
of
any
kind
each
flavor
stood
on
its
own
and
stood
out
at
distinct
moments
it
was
an
outstanding
experience
d
overall
this
was
a
good
stout
i
thought
it
smelt
great
lots
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
only
thing
that
brought
this
down
for
me
was
the
taste
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
luckily
i
split
it
with
a
buddy
because
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
full
22
oz
bottle
by
myself
because
of
the
sweetness
either
way
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
try
it
again
d
kevin
at
grape
gourmet
was
raving
about
this
beer
but
it
didnt
really
wow
me
its
a
very
solid
impy
that
occasionally
comes
close
to
approaching
greatness
but
it
doesnt
really
justify
the
minihype
its
been
receiving
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
but
it
wont
redefine
your
view
of
stouts
or
anything
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
glad
to
see
williamsburg
continuing
to
branch
out
in
to
this
type
of
thing
i
loved
the
bourbon
barrel
porter
and
think
that
this
is
actually
a
slight
though
not
enormous
step
down
and
i
hope
they
continue
to
do
so
let
this
one
sit
in
the
barrels
for
about
twice
as
long
or
simply
add
a
little
less
extra
fermentable
material
next
time
as
id
rather
have
a
dryer
beer
with
more
bourbon
punch
than
a
beer
that
sacrifices
balance
for
the
sake
of
covering
up
what
to
some
may
be
a
potentially
desirable
note
though
i
do
agree
that
spirit
balance
is
also
key
perhaps
the
second
cut
of
the
barrels
will
leech
a
little
less
whiskeybourbon
in
to
the
mix
and
that
leeway
can
be
afforded
more
easily
regardless
an
excellent
beer
and
one
id
gladly
try
again
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
new
offering
so
despite
the
warm
sunny
afternoon
i
forge
ahead
with
opening
a
bottle
from
my
experience
with
the
bb
porter
im
expecting
a
smooth
sessionable
barrel
aged
stout
and
this
delivers
on
that
pours
a
thick
sludgy
milk
chocolate
color
with
a
dense
thick
coffee
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
surprising
amounts
of
wet
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
the
highlights
for
me
the
aroma
immediately
brings
a
slightly
lesser
kbs
to
mind
with
a
strong
bourbon
and
vanilla
presence
balancing
chocolate
molasses
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thick
and
viscous
syrupy
on
the
palate
with
a
watery
finish
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
an
initial
lactic
sweetness
from
the
base
beer
and
finishes
with
a
strong
oaky
and
vanilla
sweetness
overall
very
balanced
but
there
is
much
less
bourbon
or
coffee
flavor
as
the
nose
suggests
not
quite
as
complex
or
interesting
as
kbs
but
also
much
easier
drinking
and
nearly
the
same
price
for
a
22
oz
bottle
instead
of
a
12
a
very
exciting
new
beer
from
williamsburg
alewerks
pick
some
up
when
you
see
it
but
probably
not
worth
hunting
down
particularly
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
bourbon
or
coffee
fix
you
know
right
away
what
this
beer
aims
to
be
but
with
this
style
represented
so
well
by
other
breweries
it
falls
a
bit
short
still
a
nice
beer
theres
an
acrid
sour
taste
to
this
that
is
unappealing
the
flavor
isnt
unpleasant
but
not
robust
some
cofee
some
chocolate
almost
sour
chocolate
milk
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
i
can
drink
it
and
its
not
unpleasant
but
there
are
far
better
beers
out
there
that
are
easily
available
a
very
nice
minnesotan
stout
another
factor
for
the
lower
rating
was
probably
the
mental
comparison
to
a
solid
barrelaged
stout
earlier
that
evening
not
fair
but
just
accentuated
the
weaknesses
moo
joos
pours
black
with
a
1
dark
tan
head
roast
and
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
grain
aromas
rise
from
the
glass
a
mild
sweetness
runs
throughout
with
some
chocolate
that
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
the
roast
is
mild
and
is
moderated
by
a
pinch
of
caramel
there
is
a
little
oatmeal
body
feel
on
your
tongue
but
overall
the
body
is
little
thin
o
a
nice
milk
stout
that
i
would
really
enjoy
with
breakfast
not
really
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
pass
up
given
this
i
would
like
to
try
this
if
there
was
a
coffee
version
of
this
brew
first
bottle
to
a
tulip
glass
even
though
the
pour
was
moderately
aggressive
no
head
at
all
just
a
tan
ring
no
visible
carbonation
second
bottle
to
a
pilsener
glass
very
aggressive
pour
to
better
cause
a
head
and
view
any
carbonation
2nd
time
a
1
inch
tan
head
bubbly
dissipates
relatively
quickly
with
lacing
carbonation
is
virtually
nonexistant
an
occasional
bubble
is
visible
rising
up
and
i
have
to
hold
it
to
the
light
to
see
that
after
a
few
minutes
no
visible
carbonation
at
all
dark
brown
to
black
color
very
nice
roasted
aroma
taste
follows
the
aroma
dominated
by
roasted
malts
transitioning
to
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
only
slightly
bitter
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
flat
very
flat
overall
this
is
a
very
blah
beer
not
very
good
at
all
it
is
not
drainpour
bad
but
there
is
nothing
special
at
all
in
this
beer
and
the
lack
of
mouth
feel
makes
it
really
a
struggle
to
try
to
enjoy
given
the
reviews
i
expected
a
lot
more
i
gave
this
beer
2
full
bottles
before
writing
this
review
while
the
2nd
made
perhaps
a
slightly
better
impression
than
the
first
this
does
rank
as
the
worst
stoutporter
ive
had
to
date
admittedly
not
a
huge
sample
population
but
i
definitely
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
lactose
cream
oat
biterness
light
bodied
and
a
touch
creamy
a
pretty
decent
melding
of
oatmeal
and
milk
stouts
thanks
overall
4
27
i
was
super
impressed
with
this
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
and
yes
in
a
six
pack
to
share
it
around
a
fireplace
or
with
friends
on
a
chilly
night
heck
id
just
buy
it
to
drink
and
relax
with
a
good
tv
show
or
a
nice
book
this
is
the
borders
of
beer
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
oatmeal
milk
stout
all
i
can
taste
is
the
coffee
aspect
it
lacks
the
lactose
sweetness
and
oatmeal
silkiness
which
are
usually
present
in
them
as
stated
previously
this
bears
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
iced
coffee
i
guess
this
isnt
a
very
professional
review
but
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
this
brewery
o
it
is
actually
better
than
i
anticipated
it
has
some
nice
coffee
notes
and
i
like
the
creamy
mouthfeel
ch33rs
overall
its
not
a
bad
milk
stout
beautiful
appearance
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
would
buy
it
again
a
very
very
tasty
beer
sweet
and
chocolaty
very
drinkable
no
flaws
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
good
and
true
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
and
i
would
put
it
just
about
on
the
same
level
as
left
hands
milk
stout
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
creamy
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
getting
bored
with
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
this
pretty
much
the
definition
of
a
milk
stout
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
would
change
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
and
keep
some
around
in
the
fridge
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
nitro
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
had
no
weak
points
this
made
for
a
good
first
impression
for
the
brau
brothers
and
ill
have
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
their
beers
good
job
guys
i
liked
the
taste
that
wasnt
quite
dark
chocolates
but
you
seemed
to
take
another
drink
to
try
find
more
of
those
dark
chocolate
tastes
its
a
bit
frothy
maybe
even
spritzy
thats
off
even
though
the
full
body
is
achieved
it
leans
very
very
close
to
medium
carbonation
is
just
too
high
for
a
stout
particularly
an
oatmeal
stout
and
it
isnt
as
smooth
as
it
should
be
because
of
it
o
very
nice
crossover
milk
oatmeal
stout
with
a
super
aroma
overall
drink
this
warm
for
best
results
but
the
aroma
was
definitely
better
than
the
flavor
overall
pretty
standard
profile
but
a
very
wellexecuted
brew
above
average
for
the
style
but
not
something
id
seek
out
overall
not
bad
i
really
like
the
toasted
flavors
thought
the
acidity
is
a
bit
too
high
for
my
tastes
its
smooth
but
not
as
thick
as
id
like
o
definitely
a
lighter
style
of
stout
hits
every
point
of
a
sweeter
style
stout
with
milky
overtones
yet
musty
cheers
nice
easy
drinking
stout
a
really
drinkable
stout
combining
the
best
elements
of
a
milk
stout
and
an
oatmeal
stout
the
pour
is
the
darkest
brown
with
no
light
able
to
pass
through
and
a
few
fingers
of
off
white
bubbles
that
slowly
fade
to
a
thin
film
the
nose
is
definitely
sweet
from
the
lactose
sugars
but
also
bitter
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
i
pick
up
a
little
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
too
the
flavor
roasted
barley
heavy
dark
and
bitter
without
as
much
sweetness
as
the
nose
suggests
until
the
very
end
this
is
a
hearty
warming
cold
weather
beer
with
a
velvety
smooth
texture
from
the
oatmeal
and
a
fuller
soft
body
there
is
a
little
chocolate
flavor
in
the
finish
enough
to
counteract
the
bitterness
an
elegant
stout
that
would
be
extremely
well
suited
t
the
nitro
tap
my
first
beer
from
brau
brothers
looking
forward
to
my
next
this
is
very
well
done
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
yellowish
head
on
top
it
faded
really
quickly
leaving
hardly
any
retention
and
definitely
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
strange
side
not
really
appealing
to
me
there
are
some
subtle
chocolate
and
roasted
aromas
but
there
is
something
else
in
there
im
not
really
caring
for
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
harsh
and
burnt
right
away
but
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
becomes
a
little
more
chocolaty
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
decent
carbonation
also
overall
this
beer
was
ok
but
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
glad
i
got
to
have
it
though
also
nice
label
we
love
it
when
breweries
take
the
time
and
effort
to
market
with
am
imaginative
and
informative
label
final
thoughts
im
can
appreciate
a
good
low
abv
stout
however
i
have
trouble
truly
enjoying
an
unbalanced
one
its
a
valiant
effort
and
one
that
some
may
like
but
i
just
cant
say
im
pleased
with
this
one
would
i
drink
it
again
no
but
i
would
try
an
imperial
version
moo
joos
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
strong
smokey
coffee
aroma
with
small
hints
of
cholate
malts
mixed
in
the
taste
is
smokey
and
has
a
strong
malty
backbone
with
strong
coffee
flavors
good
full
flavor
nice
dry
felling
overall
a
very
good
bold
strong
milk
stout
overall
decent
quite
creamy
and
nice
lactose
and
oats
light
chocolate
not
chalky
which
is
nice
but
just
a
bit
of
acrid
char
a
nice
milk
stout
both
roasted
and
a
touch
bittersweet
in
the
finish
and
just
all
around
tasty
d
an
extremely
drinkable
and
satisfying
brew
my
new
favorite
session
beer
nicely
complex
but
not
overly
so
would
pair
well
with
heavier
meat
fare
e
g
filet
mignon
and
great
conversation
a
flavorful
version
of
an
oatmeal
milk
stout
which
i
enjoyed
o
b
its
ok
o
this
is
a
stout
through
and
through
the
smoky
woody
flavour
appeals
to
me
but
maybe
not
for
everyone
o
a
tasty
milk
stout
that
offers
up
a
solid
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
well
worth
a
try
and
a
delicious
treat
indeed
i
really
liked
this
one
and
it
goes
down
good
this
is
a
quality
beer
its
interesting
to
me
because
it
smells
strongly
of
chocolate
and
coffe
but
tastes
more
fruity
the
feel
is
superb
and
id
love
to
have
this
again
o
a
good
milk
stout
defeinitely
worth
trying
for
my
first
venture
into
the
milk
stout
style
this
was
enjoyable
the
sweetness
was
restrained
just
enough
to
find
balance
any
more
would
approach
cloyingly
sweet
overall
a
good
beer
and
the
third
ive
enjoyed
from
these
folks
o
i
pegged
moo
joos
to
be
a
good
breakfast
beer
but
even
as
a
heavily
roasted
black
coffee
lover
i
find
this
beer
at
the
risk
of
beating
a
dead
horse
over
the
top
on
astringent
roasted
bitterness
there
are
some
really
nice
things
going
on
in
this
beer
the
undertones
of
coffee
chocolate
dark
fruit
esters
and
even
the
oats
and
lactose
but
these
things
are
all
overshadowed
too
greatly
to
elevate
the
beer
to
something
really
enjoyable
id
knock
the
roasted
malt
back
a
bit
and
get
some
more
caramel
notes
in
there
personally
holy
black
beer
batman
very
rich
and
creamy
as
it
should
be
right
this
perfectly
named
beer
is
practically
a
meal
unto
itself
i
love
stouts
porters
the
rich
stuff
this
beer
makes
the
grade
as
alluded
to
earlier
this
beer
pours
black
with
longlasting
lattice
and
head
it
has
a
good
deal
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
its
taste
and
the
rather
low
alcohol
content
lets
other
flavors
shine
through
i
had
a
glass
with
a
grilled
cheese
my
arteries
were
screaming
but
my
taste
buds
were
slapping
high
fives
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
moo
joos
is
black
in
the
glass
with
just
the
faintest
crimson
red
border
to
it
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
mocha
in
color
very
big
and
looks
like
you
could
bounce
a
quarter
off
of
it
the
nose
is
rather
subdued
bits
of
burnt
chocolate
are
all
that
is
discernable
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
to
it
although
the
burnt
chocolate
does
take
center
stage
not
as
sweet
as
some
oatmeal
milk
stouts
ive
had
before
nor
as
creamy
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
pretty
flat
for
a
oatmeal
milk
stout
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
not
impressive
either
o
its
an
interesting
beer
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
fresh
mellows
nicely
with
a
few
months
on
it
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
clear
fairly
pitch
black
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
milk
cream
toast
oats
and
light
coffee
pretty
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
and
balance
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
the
first
stout
i
have
had
that
has
a
true
milk
aroma
component
taste
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
cream
toast
oats
caramel
and
light
coffee
slight
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
cream
and
oats
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
quite
dry
on
the
finish
good
balance
of
flavors
but
it
is
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
of
things
as
far
as
robustness
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
as
expected
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
very
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
a
little
bland
but
has
nice
balanced
flavors
and
is
certainly
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
smooth
balanced
stout
i
really
like
brau
brothers
new
lineup
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
not
quite
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
liked
but
i
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
a
simple
but
tasty
breakfast
beer
a
good
example
of
a
style
well
suited
to
the
midwest
overall
a
decent
milk
stout
very
enjoyable
and
a
solid
offering
id
drink
more
and
with
that
i
throw
my
hands
up
in
the
air
in
dismay
i
would
love
for
another
minnesota
brewery
to
step
up
and
make
like
surly
and
thb
and
be
great
and
i
would
love
for
it
to
be
brau
but
theyre
not
frankly
im
baffled
by
the
ratings
for
this
beer
in
my
book
if
you
cant
get
milk
stout
right
you
cant
really
be
redeemed
i
cant
tell
you
how
many
times
ive
seen
a
brau
beer
and
said
maybe
this
is
the
one
they
turn
it
around
with
no
more
this
timei
mean
it
if
it
was
any
thinner
id
think
people
were
cutting
this
with
like
water
and
nonfat
milk
o
one
of
the
most
surprising
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
components
come
together
optimally
to
provide
a
huge
flavor
and
aroma
experience
in
a
relatively
low
abv
package
moos
joos
proves
that
you
dont
need
high
gravity
to
have
big
aroma
and
flavor
great
job
brau
brothers
o
havent
had
many
milk
stouts
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
not
a
fan
of
anise
but
it
wasnt
over
the
top
like
stones
belgo
anise
overall
nice
sessionable
milk
stout
easy
drinking
and
simple
beer
make
it
a
little
thicker
and
a
little
more
robust
it
is
an
enjoyable
stout
an
interesting
combo
and
a
pleasant
easydrinking
stout
my
main
complaint
is
that
i
want
more
flavor
for
a
beer
with
this
much
involved
the
taste
should
have
more
potency
or
more
variety
or
both
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
that
is
really
hit
or
miss
for
me
id
recommend
this
to
any
stout
fan
disclaimer
45
years
ago
i
ripped
this
brewery
for
serious
issues
when
it
came
to
bottlingpackaging
after
buying
a
bunch
of
badinfectedhorrible
beers
ive
been
reluctant
to
purchase
anything
from
brau
bros
since
then
but
moo
joos
has
restored
my
confidence
in
the
libations
from
lucan
two
in
a
row
now
from
them
that
i
enjoyed
o
an
easy
drinker
with
a
sweet
choccoffee
taste
real
dark
with
a
strong
roasted
chocolate
aroma
subtle
chocolate
on
the
palate
with
your
typical
roastiness
expected
in
a
stout
coffee
in
the
endfinish
that
i
really
enjoy

from
brau
bros
for
sure
this
hooked
me
the
brau
bros
are
really
coming
up
in
minnesota
brewing
im
becoming
more
enamored
with
them
ever
day
o
very
solid
beer
like
oatmeal
stouts
and
milk
stouts
and
this
was
a
good
combination
of
the
two
doesnt
try
to
get
cute
with
the
flavors
but
very
good
all
the
way
around
could
drink
this
all
winter
thanks
ryan
for
the
beer
d
an
average
milk
stout
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
disappointed
the
pour
was
rather
flat
the
taste
is
more
coffee
than
oatmeal
picked
up
a
single
of
this
to
try
since
i
like
sweeter
stouts
it
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
as
the
sweeter
flavors
were
overshadowed
by
the
roasted
coffee
flavors
not
too
bad
though
overall
its
a
good
milk
stout
beer
flavorwise
it
isnt
simple
but
neither
is
it
complex
and
thats
fine
those
looking
for
a
good
stout
beer
should
check
this
out
its
my
second
beer
from
brau
brothers
and
so
far
they
have
a
solid
track
record
in
my
book
lets
hope
more
offerings
are
just
as
good
o
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
the
oatmeal
elements
are
nice
id
the
this
again
o
good
tasting
beer
just
doesnt
seem
to
pack
the
flavor
that
a
stout
should
o
a
great
beer
the
addition
of
lactose
really
helps
to
add
some
body
into
this
5
8
beer
was
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
head
so
the
appearance
took
a
knock
on
points
but
overall
a
wonderful
offering
from
brau
brothers
drinkability
it
is
a
stellar
example
of
oatmealmilk
stout
with
a
nice
roasted
edge
very
enjoyable
decent
little
milk
stout
i
am
happy
not
to
get
too
much
of
that
sour
milk
flavor
that
i
get
at
times
medium
to
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
really
helps
the
drinker
experience
all
of
the
flavors
it
has
to
offer
the
body
is
nice
and
thick
without
being
syrupy
or
sticky
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
but
certainly
does
not
detract
from
the
flavors
just
like
most
milk
stouts
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
a
treat
to
drink
overall
maybe
not
a
whole
lot
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
but
they
seem
to
have
gotten
everything
right
for
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
stout
well
made
o
ok
but
thats
as
far
as
it
goes
wouldnt
seek
out
again
as
the
finish
was
too
medicinaly
and
the
feel
was
thin
and
watery
pours
pitch
black
seriously
i
held
it
up
to
light
and
could
not
see
through
it
brownish
tan
head
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
molasses
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malts
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
and
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
i
enjoyed
this
milk
stout
through
and
through
overall
this
was
a
miss
for
me
lacks
any
real
sweetness
or
creaminess
that
is
necessary
for
the
style
unbalanced
toward
the
roasted
flavors
there
are
much
better
examples
specifically
lancaster
just
to
name
one
pass
overall
a
really
great
oatmeal
or
milk
stout
i
guess
you
could
call
it
either
as
it
really
gets
a
lot
of
character
of
both
styles
really
spot
on
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
if
it
were
local
o
never
expected
to
try
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
im
curious
as
to
how
this
would
be
on
nitro
its
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
and
really
has
great
flavor
its
bold
and
heavy
but
it
doesnt
set
as
a
meal
quite
good
bitterness
very
mild
plays
first
on
the
palate
then
folds
back
sweet
milky
creamy
malt
flavor
runs
in
and
takes
over
theres
a
brief
pitstop
where
the
bottom
falls
out
and
the
cream
and
the
milk
is
standing
tall
bitterness
never
leaves
sweetness
never
takes
over
a
great
feat
of
balance
oats
bring
in
the
smooth
drop
the
silky
and
the
cream
is
all
gravy
here
comes
the
anise
now
and
theres
some
of
the
coffeeits
getting
goingall
the
parts
are
in
play
a
thoroughly
satisfying
stout
perhaps
my
favorite
bbbc
beer
so
far
o
a
good
dessert
stout
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
overall
a
very
good
stout
that
is
rich
and
complex
but
not
heavy
d
although
the
flavor
profile
is
a
tad
onedimensional
it
hits
the
profile
of
this
style
very
well
really
nice
chocolate
flavors
dominate
the
flavor
however
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
any
other
flavor
in
there
to
take
away
from
the
richness
of
the
chocolate
recommended
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
super
smooth
almost
slick
to
the
finish
it
is
modestly
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
in
this
brew
one
of
the
more
roasted
and
bitter
examples
of
the
style
that
gets
increasingly
more
sweet
with
each
sip
it
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
the
mineral
aspect
i
could
do
without
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
the
taste
starts
with
roasty
chocolate
malts
some
milky
and
coffee
notes
oatmeal
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
full
overall
its
pretty
good
but
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
and
it
would
probably
lend
well
to
nitrocans
or
nitrotap
for
the
student
of
stouts
in
all
their
variations
this
is
a
musttry
i
would
think
its
a
matter
of
chance
whether
any
normal
person
would
like
this
or
not
im
not
so
crazy
about
it
bought
with
a
bunch
of
other
random
stuff
at
international
beverage
selections
in
grand
rapids
smooth
creamy
modest
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
again
with
ease
the
aroma
is
great
though
a
bit
thin
its
tasty
and
a
very
nice
milk
stout
just
a
tad
over
carbed
and
a
little
thiner
probably
still
medium
body
not
bad
drinks
easy
though
quite
dry
to
me
it
was
just
a
hair
off
from
being
upper
tier
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
5
oz
snifter
pours
opaque
with
but
the
wispiest
head
coffee
toffee
and
vanilla
dominate
nose
the
taste
follows
suit
with
some
cherry
along
for
the
ride
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
really
thin
few
detractions
overall
ready
for
another
d
a
solid
oatmeal
milk
stout
that
smells
quite
good
quite
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
brau
brothers
would
pair
nicely
with
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
pitch
black
with
little
lacing
around
edge
smells
like
a
typical
oatmeal
stout
taste
has
a
great
balance
between
both
milk
and
oatmeal
sweet
from
the
sugars
and
mild
dark
chocolate
in
the
after
taste
smooth
and
chewey
leans
to
the
heavier
side
in
the
mouth
great
example
of
two
styles
blended
worth
seeking
you
can
taste
the
milk
sugars
in
this
oatmeal
stout
the
roasted
malts
adds
coffee
and
chocolate
to
the
mix
interesting
oatmeal
and
milk
stout
mix
for
a
nice
long
session
this
may
be
the
one
time
in
my
life
that
a
tap
beer
played
second
fiddle
to
a
bottle
for
one
reason
or
another
the
bottle
mellowed
everything
out
tap
was
basically
more
aggressive

didnt

overall
this
is
the
brew
that
made
me
a
believer
in
brau
bros
even
if
i
only
find
one
more
offering
from
them
that
is
built
as
well
as
this
beer
it
will
have
been
worth
it
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
by
anyone
and
everyone
enjoy
enjoy
o
i
think
this
beer
overextended
itself
i
didnt
get
the
creaminess
of
the
lactose
or
the
distinct
flavour
of
rolled
oats
nothing
really
stood
out
a
pretty
solid
milk
stout
overall
and
nicely
drinkable
do
despite
the
seeming
mass
appeal
of
stouts
among
those
with
a
taste
for
artisanal
beer
styles
the
bottled
nonimperial
variety
may
be
an
endangered
species
this
oatmeal
and
milk
sugar
hybrid
is
a
real
winner
with
full
and
interesting
qualities
that
are
packed
into
a
a
fairly
small
package
at
sub6
abv
the
smell
reminds
of
a
dairy
product
that
has
been
left
out
a
bit
too
long
yet
it
works
the
finish
is
particularly
compelling
with
a
satisfyingly
intense
host
of
dark
qualities
that
will
lodge
in
the
memory
and
hopefully
grow
into
a
favorable
reputation
for
the
brewer
overall
very
good
beer
i
would
certainly
want
to
have
this
again
probabaly
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
certainly
enjoyable
overallvery
impressed
fits

i
would
absolutey
pick
this
one
up
if
i
had
access
to
it
skal
o
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
had
while
its
certainaly
no
moloko
its
still
a
great
representation
of
the
style
well
done
brau
brothers
overall
a
very
nice
dark
session
beer
a
little
light
compared
to
its
big
brothers
in
the
field
but
a
fine
brew
none
the
less
o
a
nice
and
creamy
milk
stout
the
oat
addition
makes
it
all
the
better
pretty
good
drinkability
too
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
o
not
really
digging
this
one
too
much
oi
really
like
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
grays
oatmeal
stout
of
years
ago
that
i
liked
back
then
not
sure
if
that
one
is
still
around
but
this
is
a
fine
example
o
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
as
well
as
the
lactose
coming
through
well
on
the
flavor
profile
the
cpj
o
really
good
beer
overall
layered
flavors
great
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
in
scent

textured
mouthfeel

stout
no
but
good
sweet

the
right
places
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
about
1
cm
of
head
and
a
deep
black
color
the
nose
on
this
brew
is
great
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
chocolate
and
aromatics
that
only
oats
can
bring
to
the
table
the
taste
is
has
some
nice
smooth
chocolate
with
some
creamy
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
velvety
very
very
smooth
but
somewhat
light
overall
i
honestly
cant
find
anything
that
i
really
dont
like
about
this
brew
its
incredibly
drinkable
awesome
stuff
m
slightly
watery
for
an
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
quite
compliment
the
creamy
flavors
like
i
would
hope
on
the
plus
side
it
is
very
drinkable
and
the
carbonation
is
good
too

i
am
aware
samuel
smiths
isnt
a
milk
stout
it
is
however
an
oatmeal
stout
im
rereading
some
of
the
other
reviews
of
this
and
i
cant
possibly
believe
this
is
the
same
beer
they
drank
its
not
possible
given
what
im
reading
but
im
looking
right
at
the
label
on
the
bottle
and
its
the
same
this
stuff
is
watered
down
swill
in
my
opinion
and
i
cant
believe
they
had
the
same
stuff
im
having
sorry
d
highly
drinkable
a
great
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
brau
bros
i
just
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
i
came
back
to
bump
up
the
overall
slightly
because
as
this
beer
went
down
it
got
better
in
the
end
it
really
is
a
nice
oatmeal
milk
stout
good
work
brau
bros
thanks
to
mnbearsfan
for
this
12
oz
bottle
via
trade
poured
a
thin
black
with
a
mochatan
small
onefinger
head
nose
was
some
smokeash
chocolate
molasses
and
brown
sugar
taste
was
vanilla
oatmeal
chocolate
and
coffee
as
was
expected
but
also
some
fruit
cherries
body
was
smooth
but
thin
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
offering
in
a
style
i
like
but
i
have
found
others
i
like
more
saw
this
a
few
days
ago
for
only
7
99sixer
and
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
considering
this
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
its
locally
made
i
did
have
reservations
though
since
ive
been
less
than
impressed
with
most
offerings
from
this
brewery
that
being
said
pours
a
dark
brown
color
almost
completely
black
in
the
glass
and
despite
a
hard
pour
it
produced
little
head
with
no
lacing
this
was
the
only
part
of
this
beer
that
was
less
than
amazing
full
luxurious
aroma
of
chocolate
cream
light
coffee
and
sweetness
with
no
alcohol
coming
through
smells
heavenly
and
the
chocolate
and
lactose
really
dominate
the
aroma
which
i
really
love
taste
is
a
home
run
creamy
milk
chocolate
up
front
a
touch
of
graham
cracker
a
hint
of
espresso
and
just
enough
enough
charred
malts
to
make
this
interesting
its
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
just
a
perfect
amount
of
balance
between
the
sweetnesstoffeechocolate
and
the
roast
that
really
make
this
stand
out
there
is
a
slight
twang
from
the
lactose
in
the
middle
but
is
then
washed
away
by
a
semidry
chocolaty
finish
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
milk
stout
nothing
stands
out
too
much
away
from
the
rest
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
and
its
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
silky
smooth
probably
from
the
toasted
and
rolled
oats
used
in
the
mash
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
but
that
only
serves
to
reinforce
the
slick
mouthfeel
damn
this
beer
is
winning
i
can
hardly
believe
this
has
come
out
of
brau
borthers
a
very
much
underwhelming
brewery
for
me
and
i
imagine
this
is
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come
from
this
brewer
if
this
truly
is
a
new
year
round
beer
i
can
see
myself
buying
at
least
a
couple
sixers
a
month
great
great
stuff
here
really
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
and
the
cask
yeast
seems
to
add
a
little
extra
character
bold
but
still
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
kind
you
need
to
have
2
or
3
of
really
good
stuff
d
its
about
as
easy
to
drink
as
they
come
this
will
be
a
beer
i
reach
for
once
the
snow
starts
to
fly
and
so
should
you
the
glass
becomes
a
vessle
for
this
ominous
looking
mass
that
is
so
dark
theres
just
a
hint
if
brown
on
the
edges
the
aroma
is
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
perhaps
cinammon
its
taste
wow
the
cocoa
and
milk
are
most
of
the
flavor
and
are
very
sweet
with
some
roasted
malt
on
top
this
is
like
drining
a
chololate
brownie
its
so
tasty
this
is
absolute
repeat
buy
and
im
glad
its
in
the
build
a
sixpack
section
o
this
is
a
very
good
sweet
stout
at
any
price
and
even
better
since
it
retails
at
about
7
per
6
pack
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
for
sure
really
an
excellent
beer
from
brau
brothers
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
near
black
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
sticky
tan
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
strong
graham
cracker
cream
roasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
very
nice
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hing
of
chocolate
and
some
very
faint
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
really
like
the
way
it
straddles
between
two
styles
one
sip
makes
me
think
it
is
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
than
a
milk
stout
while
the
next
sip
makes
me
think
the
opposite
i
can
see
this
beer
becoming
one
of
my
go
to
stouts
a
good
balanced
stout
that
has
a
lower
abv
possible
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
solid
milk
stout
with
good
aroma
and
flavor
and
impeccable
mouthfeel
probably
my
favorite
brau
bros
brew
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
stout
especially
once
you
factor
in
the
price
thanks
geoff
o
goes
does
very
easy
quite
tasty
not
very
filling
mild
kick
great
representation
of
style
i
enjoy
milk
stouts
and
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
hit
this
one
up
regularly
if
it
were
distributed
here
a
superb
stout
especially
for
the
price
will
definitely
purchase
again
to
be
honest
i
was
not
very
impressed
to
start
out
but
this
is
one
tasty
brew
i
will
definitely
seek
out
in
the
future
good
luck
trying
to
find
a
better
sweet
stout
for
this
price
wish
this
were
a
bit
more
fuller
bodied
could
use
a
touch
of
a
revision
for
next
years
brew
but
this
was
an
excellent
effort
give
it
a
try
and
support
small
mn
breweries
notes
interesting
milk
stout
nice
flavors
with
an
interesting
smokey
kick
great
body
and
nice
flavor
not
amazing
but
very
nice
note
i
tried
another
bottle
this
time
straight
from
the
fridge
at
this
lower
temperature
a
smokey
flavor
dominated
the
palate
i
definately
suggest
drinking
moo
joos
at
50
degrees
f
or
warmer
to
enjoy
it
in
its
glorious
complexity
overall
a
really
really
delicious
beer
the
drinkability
is
phenomenal
and
the
mouthfeel
is
unbeatable
its
tasty
and
complex
without
being
a
chore
to
consume
great
job
guys
pretty
solid
milk
stout
here
can
and
will
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
this
stuff
extremely
drinkable
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
with
ease
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
sweet
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
while
great
job
brau
bros
this
one
is
an
absolute
winner
and
i
look
forward
to
having
more
all
in
all
not
a
bad
offering
nothing
earthshaking
but
definitely
well
made
and
worth
revisiting
regularly
ill
buy
it
again
d
brau
brothers
has
done
a
really
nice
job
of
providing
very
drinkable
complex
beverages
at
a
great
price
point
this
moo
joos
sixer
was
6
99
was
was
the
ring
neck
braun
ale
which
i
picked
up
at
the
same
time
wrapped
around
a
cold
minnesota
evening
moo
joos
is
a
great
beverage
to
enjoy
so
surprised
by
this
beer
i
almost
didnt
think
anything
about
it
as
ive
walked
by
it
off
and
on
for
a
year
or
two
i
grabbed
some
finally
wow
amazing
beer
two
thumbs
up
great
flavor
well
worth
the
money
very
good
beer
slight
chocolate
taste
creamy
smooth
hope
i
can
find
it
in
town
super
underrated
cream
stout
this
is
without
question
the
best
milk
stout
to
pair
with
fried
food
on
the
planet
love
stouts
and
sports
this
beer
is
perfect
to
pair
with
your
game
day
faves
overall
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
this
feeling
right
here
yes
solid
stout
but
nothing
too
memorable
imo
fantastic
oatmeal
milk
stout
for
5
this
beer
is
spot
on
fantastic
silky
mouthfeel
a
light
sweet
oat
and
chocolate
nose
and
a
nice
sweet
chocolate
and
cream
taste
had
this
at
a
local
bar
after
a
couple
rounds
of
fireball
i
asked
if
they
had
any
stout
and
this
was
recommended
i
really
enjoyed
it
after
pouring
from
can
into
16
oz
pint
glass
has
a
sweet
taste
great
taste
and
the
smell
is
really
nice
like
roasted
coffee
with
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
which
was
really
disappointing
but
expected
with
a
lower
abv
oatmeal
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
overall
a
really
fine
example
of
the
oatmeal
stout
from
the
big
head
to
the
gently
sweet
roastiness
and
the
full
smooth
body
the
savory
soy
notes
are
a
definite
bonus
i
would
happily
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
all
maltiness
and
sweetness
with
just
hints
here
and
there
of
more
bitter
flavors
its
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
doesnt
necessarily
encourage
sipping
so
much
as
drinking
anyone
criticizing
this
for
being
too
sweet
is
confusing
milk
stouts
with
some
other
kind
of
stout
will
repeat
o
very
drinkable
and
plenty
of
flavor
in
a
smooth
milk
stout
this
was
sweet
and
disgusting
i
love
stouts
but
this
one
was
very
grosstasting
this
is
the
very
first
beer
i
have
every
poured
down
the
drain
everything
else
they
make
at
tallgrass
is
quite
good
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
smell
is
strong
of
chocolate
sweet
taste
is
of
chocolate
a
good
bit
of
coffee
that
was
not
apparent
in
the
smell
slightly
sweet
tasty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
quality
beer
worth
trying
o
this
fit
the
hallmarks
of
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
in
terms
of
the
body
and
fullness
though
a
little
less
body
that
i
had
hoped
the
coffee
and
vanilla
paired
well
balancing
any
bitterness
from
the
coffee
roast
from
the
website
this
stout
is
brewed
with
cream
sugar
so
that
may
explain
it
tried
this
at
a
local
beer
expo
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
creamy
and
delicious
bitter
end
but
not
too
bitter
can
pour
into
pint
glass
pours
a
pitch
dark
color
with
a
thin
and
reedy
off
white
head
nose
is
milk
chocolate
and
filter
coffee
a
very
smooth
cream
stout
with
a
great
lactose
feel
to
it
solid
great
beer
great
taste
had
with
a
prime
rib
dinner
paired
well
was
on
tap
thin
for
a
stout
no
head
retention
drinkable
but
forgettable
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
has
a
thin
fizzy
quicklydissipating
head
a
dark
brown
appearance
and
no
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
of
creamy
chocolaty
darkroasted
barley
malt
coffee
and
brown
bread
crust
the
flavor
is
of
that
with
a
touch
of
char
sugar
and
very
mellow
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
velvety
and
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
finishes
semidry
and
highly
drinkable
rjt
love
this
beer
the
vanilla
option
last
year
was
even
better
wish
i
could
get
this
one
at
home
dont
be
put
off
by
the
name
if
you
enjoy
stouts
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
very
smooth
stout
but
very
ordinary
if
somebody
would
give
me
one
i
would
drink
it
purchasing
i
will
take
a
left
hand
milk
stout
any
day
of
the
week
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
was
retired
i
wonder
how
old
this
can
was
o
great
beer
id
call
it
the
perfect
transition
beer
from
summer
to
fall
very
drinkable
nice
complexity
to
it
cant
wait
to
pick
it
up
again
a
decent
stout
rich
chocolate
taste
thick
and
smooth
smell
unassuming
beer
in
scent
notes
of
milk
cream
and
oatmeal
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
tastemouthfeel
incredible
creamy
dark
oatmeal
and
roasted
barley
it
is
so
dark
and
thick
that
it
felt
almost
chewy
in
texture
and
taste
notes
of
chocolate
and
slight
caramel
come
through
part
way
into
the
glass
the
creaminess
lingers
in
the
mouth
long
after
i
expected
overall
spectacular
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorites
o
very
well
constructed
creamy
oatmeal
stoutoaty
milk
stout
ill
buy
this
again
at
the
right
price
it
is
always
available
as
a
mix
6
9
99
at
my
local
grocery
store
which
is
nice
a
little
thin
and
very
straightforward
but
a
pleasant
and
easydrinking
beer
it
doesnt
particularly
stand
out
in
any
way
however
black
in
color
with
a
head
that
was
minimal
and
rapidly
faded
entirely
delectable
aroma
of
oatmealchocolateand
dark
malt
there
is
plenty
of
oatmeal
chocolateand
dark
malt
in
the
flavor
but
the
oatmeal
clearly
dominates
the
mouth
is
a
bit
oily
and
thick
overall
pretty
good
milk
stout
but
id
prefer
there
to
be
more
roastcoffee
to
compliment
the
sweetness
theres
also
a
werid
waterymilky
finish
that
lingers
a
bit
on
the
tongue
and
the
top
of
the
mouth
which
detracts
for
me
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
stouts
on
the
sweeter
side
82100
the
bar
is
lowly
lit
but
the
beer
appears
near
black
and
opaque
with
approximately
a
half
inch
of
beige
head
big
chocolate
aromas
with
some
milk
presence
chocolate
milk
flavor
throughout
elegant
and
light
on
the
palate
but
by
no
means
thin
a
tad
sweet
complimented
by
some
bitter
chocolaty
tones
in
the
finish
really
tasty
on
tap
at
bernies
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
light
brown
foamy
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
that
is
perfect
in
texture
a
must
try
very
delicious
and
a
nice
find
from
a
state
thats
not
as
well
known
for
their
craft
beer
a
lot
of
tallgrass
fans
which
i
absolutely
am
swear
by
this
beer
as
their
favorite
from
this
great
brewery
i
am
not
one
of
them
a
nice
beer
but
just
not
enough
body
in
my
humble
opinion
for
me
to
give
this
as
outstanding
rating
to
date
i
think
tallgrass
pale
ale
8bit
and
their
ipas
ethos
and
oasis
are
better
dont
get
me
wrong
the
taste
itself
is
great
the
whole
minus
here
is
the
fact
that
the
overall
body
is
thin
perhaps
a
bit
more
of
a
transitional
stout
over
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
pretty
meh
as
far
as
a
milk
stout
is
concerned
but
i
will
say
this
it
makes
a
great
beer
shake
pours
a
very
deep
reddishbrown
which
is
almost
black
in
color
a
thin
beige
head
is
seen
that
just
settles
to
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
of
roasted
malts
right
up
front
with
oatmeal
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
taste
has
even
more
great
flavors
with
some
black
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
very
tasty
and
is
a
easy
drinker
perfect
carbonation
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
overall
a
great
oatmeal
cream
stout
8
for
a
4
pk
of
16
oz
cans
enjoy
i
went
easy
on
my
ratings
because
perhaps
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
way
too
much
carbonation
nasty
smell
and
taste
that
was
just
not
something
i
enjoyed
no
one
ever
accused
me
of
being
a
beer
snob
at
least
not
yet
in
fact
im
new
to
craft
beers
and
am
still
learning
ive
only
kegged
my
second
batch
of
home
brew
just
today
what
i
do
know
is
what
i
like
this
beer
along
with
the
vanilla
counterpart
are
my
current
all
time
favorite
brews
im
sure
that
nobody
would
fault
me
if
this
valentines
day
i
took
my
woman
to
a
private
place
and
enjoyed
a
little
buffalo
sweat
in
fact
i
highly
recommend
that
you
do
the
same
you
wont
regret
it
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
45
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
example
of
the
style
its
not
for
everyone
though
and
the
sweetness
can
be
overwhelming
if
youre
used
to
other
styles
if
you
can
find
it
pick
it
up
overall
a
pretty
awesome
example
of
the
style
dark
sweet
balancing
bitterness
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
to
see
this
cranked
up
to
an
imperial
level
with
a
ton
more
malt
and
booze
then
we
would
be
talking
about
a
downright
awesome
imperial
stout
i
feel
like
i
had
this
too
soon
out
of
the
fridge
as
it
was
lacking
some
of
the
creaminess
i
was
expecting
foam
disappeared
quickly
after
the
pour
and
it
had
a
definite
oatmeal
nose
without
being
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
smooth
tasting
creamy
without
being
rich
a
solid
beer
but
cold
it
wasnt
as
great
as
it
could
have
been
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
outstanding
but
i
think
the
ba
score
is
pretty
appropriate
overall
pleasant
enough
but
a
bit
too
sweet
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
in
any
quantity
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
and
very
smooth
stout
as
a
bonus
it
clocks
in
at
only
5
o
this
beer
has
a
great
aroma
that
really
reminded
me
of
founders
breakfast
stout
so
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
when
the
taste
did
not
match
it
too
much
tobacco
for
me
and
really
reminded
me
of
the
way
an
ashtray
smells
the
finish
was
quite
pleasant
however
descent
stout
would
definitely
hit
the
spot
around
the
holidays
or
as
a
dessert
beverage
its
worth
a
try
first
and
foremost
love
the
name
secondly
this
is
a
decent
stout
for
the
abv
to
be
where
its
at
and
the
taste
to
be
where
its
at
it
just
works
well
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
nice
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
milk
chocolate
with
hints
of
mocha
the
taste
is
a
creamy
almost
nestle
start
then
finishes
slightly
bitter
to
leave
an
espresso
flare
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
very
nice
sessionable
stout
very
drinkable
with
a
good
taste
that
doesnt
over
do
anything
but
leaves
you
wanting
another
drink
o
this
is
a
revisit
and
decided
to
review
solid
effort
here
from
tallgrass
i
really
like
the
lighter
feel
to
this
stout
i
could
drink
this
several
times
a
day
overall
damn
i
really
liked
this
stout
all
of
its
subtleties
really
add
up
to
a
really
damn
fine
stout
overall
its
a
spot
on
oatmeal
stout
vanilla
bean
one
is
better
though
this
one
is
very
very
drinkable
and
sessionable

overall
a
very
decent
stout
though
perhaps
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
in
body
i
like
the
fact
that
the
beer
comes
in
an
aluminum
can
which
is
much
easier
to
recycle
besides
i
like
tangy
metallic
ambience
provided
by
the
can
overall
a
little
disappointed
as
it
looked
great
coming
out
of
the
can
feels
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
if
you
want
to
knock
a
few
back
this
is
a
good
beer
but
if
you
want
something
bold
and
palateable
look
elsewhere
after
finishing
the
beer
from
the
glass
the
glass
had
a
nice
aroma
of
malt
and
chocolate
no
cola
smell
present
last
of
the
beers
i
brought
home
from
kansas
o
im
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
and
it
all
is
from
the
mouthfeel
it
drinks
like
a
soda
just
way
too
carbonated
and
light
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
unless
it
was
on
a
nitro
tap
this
beer
i
bought
in
cans
and
poured
into
a
frozen
mug
could
hardly
see
any
light
through
the
mug
pretty
dark
color
it
smelled
pleasant
it
had
a
medium
texture
in
the
mouth
for
a
stout
beer
lots
of
flavor
as
soon
as
it
hit
my
tongue
chocolate
coffee
and
malty
but
didnt
leave
any
strong
aftertaste
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
balance
dark
beers
ive
ever
drank
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
these
o
buffalo
sweat
may
seem
menacing
based
on
its
cans
artwork
and
black
appearance
but
this
lowerinalcohol
stout
is
fullflavored
and
robust
delicately
balancing
between
its
smooth
seductive
side
and
its
aggressive
roasted
qualities
try
and
tell
me
you
could
put
a
few
of
these
delicious
brews
back
buffalo
sweat
is
a
delicious
cream
stout
with
a
mild
profile
smooth
feel
and
balanced
profile
the
flavor
is
a
mild
roasted
grain
stout
flavor
which
is
deservingly
overshadowed
by
the
creamy
texture
and
smooth
quality
of
the
beer
many
cream
beers
are
just
a
little
wetter
tasting
than
their
noncream
counterparts
but
this
one
definitely
has
a
genuine
cream
feel
a
well
crafted
and
easy
to
drink
beer
buffalo
sweat
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
their
is
a
very
creamy
malty
slightly
smokey
and
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
very
creamy
and
rich
just
hints
of
coffee
and
cream
and
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
very
nice
full
flavors
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
fantastic
milksweet
stout
very
well
built
together
oa
pretty
good
milk
stout
i
personally
liked
left
hands
better
as
this
one
lacks
complexity
and
is
a
bit
too
dry
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
consumed
from
spiegelau
snifter
aroma
is
unexpectedly
organic
almost
sugarbeets
and
cut
grass
dominating
taste
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
hollow
like
something
is
missing
almost
feels
watered
down
more
sweet
than
bitter
thin
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
but
overall
bland
and
average
for
style
this
beers
pours
with
little
to
no
head
theres
a
slight
brown
skim
across
the
surface
theres
limited
carbonation
the
scent
is
coffee
roasted
nuts
etc
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
the
cream
but
its
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
the
biggest
flavor
is
the
roasty
finish
just
a
ton
of
roast
flavor
that
lingers
in
your
mouth
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
bitter
though
its
a
quality
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
oagain
when
poured
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
if
you
buy
a
4pack
in
cans
i
definitely
recommend
pouring
the
first
one
you
try
into
a
glass
if
it
is
too
bitter
to
your
liking
wait
a
few
months
and
try
again
this
last
can
redeemed
the
others
o
loaded
down
with
vanilla
bean
this
beer
just
pops
and
really
one
i
would
reach
for
time
time
again
the
regular
is
good
in
its
own
right
but
manoman
that
vanilla
bean
is
much
better
overall
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
was
thinking
of
something
bigger
to
chew
on
overall
this
isnt
something
to
wax
overly
poetic
about
but
yet
lays
down
a
solidly
smooth
profile
typical
of
the
style
enjoyable
overall
fairly
good
while
light
in
the
aromatics
department
it
was
solid
in
flavor
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
anticipated
not
that
i
found
that
to
be
disagreeable
dark
brown
with
clarity
at
the
edges
light
brown
head
nose
has
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
grains
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
sweeter
malt
lending
to
a
creamy
stout
nose
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
nose
roast
grains
coffee
grains
and
a
light
bitterness
that
rolls
into
the
finish
but
the
sweetness
prevails
thin
body
and
lighter
than
id
like
but
still
serves
the
beer
well
low
carbonation
overall
i
can
think
of
several
stouts
i
would
choose
in
front
of
this
one
but
i
would
certainly
enjoy
this
one
if
it
came
as
part
of
a
tallgrass
sampler
or
something
similar
d
not
a
bad
stout
from
tallgrass
would
be
really
awesome
if
they
could
nitrogenate
this
brewthese
cans
would
add
an
appreciated
dimension
to
the
body
d
fairly
basic
milk
stout
but
done
well
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
like
all
the
firkins
tallgrass
is
putting
out
of
this
beer
with
different
ingredients
in
each
one
they
have
all
been
a
nice
surprise
at
a
fest
or
bars
o
very
smooth
sweet
and
drinkable
meh
wont
have
it
ontap
again
but
i
can
see
it
being
popular
overall
not
bad
nice
malt
flavors
except
a
bit
of
burnt
metallic
acrid
roast
but
not
a
lot
nice
mocha
nice
creamy
oats
and
plenty
of
lactose
and
another
negative
with
that
charred
powdered
chalky
gritty
feel
o
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
not
overly
complex
but
is
very
well
brewed
o
almost
exactly
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
complex
nose
straight
forward
taste
another
good
beer
from
tallgrass
its
a
little
flabby
a
little
sweet
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
really
get
on
board
with
it
but
pretty
easy
drinking
o
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
the
flavors
that
are
present
are
wellrounded
and
very
enjoyable
its
become
my
goto
stout
when
i
want
something
familiar
and
available
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
o
nice
stout
with
some
chocolate
and
roast
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
too
many
new
milk
stouts
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
ill
say
smooth
delivery
and
feel
with
a
flavor
profile
that
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
not
the
most
aggressive
characteristics
on
the
flavor
but
all
the
lactic
and
stout
tones
are
there
a
real
easy
drinker
drinkability
a
solid
clean
oatmealsweet
stout
the
sweetness
comes
through
but
is
never
overly
seet
glad
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
i
could
have
several
of
these
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
amazing
in
nitrocans
or
on
nitrotap
just
the
right
bodymouthfeel
that
the
nitro
would
be
a
pleasant
edition
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
might
even
consider
this
one
a
sessionable
stout
which
i
do
not
find
a
lot
of
beers
which
qualify
final
thoughts
this
is
a
good
stout
definitely
one
to
try
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
the
buffalo
sweat
name
doesnt
exactly
get
my
taste
buds
watering
however
taking
a
closer
look
at
our
travel
pic
the
two
tone
color
of
the
beer
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
an
actual
buffalos
coloration
i
have
no
idea
how
tallgrass
came
up
with
the
name
so
its
just
an
observation
creative
names
are
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
find
in
the
booming
craft
beer
industry
but
this
one
doesnt
leave
me
dreaming
about
the
next
one
the
taste
is
well
the
can
is
right
theres
nothing
like
it
heavy
on
the
burned
charred
malt
for
sure
lots
of
coffee
bitterness
with
just
a
hint
of
overly
bitter
dark
chocolate
all
those
flavors
make
it
feel
like
black
coffee
bitter
upfront
the
lactose
only
really
adds
a
bit
but
too
late
to
matter
very
dark
pour
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
smell
is
coffee
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
some
brown
sugar
molasses
smooth
and
easy
drinking
stout
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
not
overbearing
heavy
lacing
on
my
glass
throughout
the
beer
glad
to
have
this
stout
around
iowa
the
nose
is
heavy
with
toasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
there
is
a
bit
of
tobacco
and
toffee
and
just
the
faintest
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
a
pretty
wellbalanced
blend
of
toasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
with
the
emphasis
about
6040
on
toasted
malt
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
beer
is
sweet
all
the
way
the
high
carbonation
makes
this
a
decent
session
beer
it
is
not
heavy
in
the
least
each
sip
is
juicy
and
thirstquenching
and
highly
flavorful
the
arrived
from
the
tap
a
black
color
with
the
darkest
brown
hues
on
the
fringes
a
modest
cap
of
tan
foam
floated
above
the
aroma
is
of
reminiscent
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
very
little
hops
in
the
aroma
these
dark
flavors
continue
on
the
palate
the
beer
moves
across
smoothly
the
flavor
profile
dwindles
a
tad
through
a
slightly
thin
center
this
is
a
nice
stout
and
very
good
with
dessert
had
it
at
velocity
five
in
arlington
in
a
16oz
can
for
6
it
was
a
pretty
good
stout
for
its
volume
and
price
the
usual
description
of
stouts
coffee
vanilla
its
better
than
a
guinness
i
even
find
it
better
than
the
gold
medal
winner
hoppin
frog
boris
the
crusher
oatmealimperial
stout
overall
i
will
keep
this
one
on
the
fridge
o
a
good
purchase
though
mostly
for
fun
than
for
actual
wanting
to
try
it
despite
the
rather
yucky
name
the
brew
is
pretty
decent
m
thick
body
very
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
a
bit
drier
than
i
expected
in
the
finish
for
a
milk
stout
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
sweet
stout
sweet
but
well
balanced
by
the
roasted
coffee
flavors
overall
if
you
like
them
sweet
you
will
find
little
to
be
disappointed
with
here
this
is
just
a
solid
cream
stout
and
at
5
it
is
one
you
can
keep
on
enjoying
i
found
that
the
smell
was
ok
the
lactose
sugars
remind
me
of
the
smell
of
a
local
dairy
processor
the
taste
was
nice
and
smooth
no
bitter
or
harsh
after
taste
i
found
that
drinking
this
beer
a
few
minutes
after
sitting
gave
it
a
little
more
flavor
drinkability
it
is
pretty
decent
stuff
it
is
not
overly
bold
and
has
everything
going
for
it
can

itself
in
a
thin

minimal

left

the

starts
with
a
rush
of
roasted
barley
and
creaminess
from
the
milk
sugar
layers
of
oats
roast
and
vanilla
come
to
the
surface
very
nice
aroma
right
on
for
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
starts
of
with
the
lactose
sweetness
this
is
followed
by
a
dry
and
sturdy
punch
from
the
roasted
barley
this
features
loads
of
flavor
and
is
exactly
to
style
the
moutfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
delicious
milk
stout
the
roasted
malt
profile
is
front
and
center
while
the
lactose
sugar
features
that
touch
of
creaminess
which
joins
the
party
of
flavor
very
nicely
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
sweet

your
thing

a

and

with

this
is
a
medium

brew
that
is
moderately
carbonated
it
has
a
slick
feel
about
it
that
lingers
inside
the
mouth
with
almost
a
filmy
coating
that
i
dont
particularly
care
for
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
one
is
not
the
sweetest
i
have
had
but
it
is
on
the
higher
end
of
the
range
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
i
would
return
to
again
if
given
choices
a
very
goodlooking
mediocre
stout
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
and
having
just
drank
a
flavorful
mild
ale
at
the
same
abv
i
know
its
possible
to
bring
flavor
without
a
huge
grain
bill
overall
very
drinkable
i
normally
dont
drink
beer
from
a
can
but
i
will
make
an
exception
for
this
my
brother
gave
me
a
can
to
try
and
now
i
want
some
more
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
everything
going
right
for
it
o
overall
a
fine
beer
for
a
5
stout
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
its
by
no
means
bad
on
a
lot
of
levels
this
is
a
very
likable
milk
stout
it
does
lack
the
punch
in
the
initial
taste
to
make
this
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
beer
is
really
smooth
great
mouthfeel
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
from
the
roast
a
nice
milk
stout
for
sure
id
have
this
again
both
my
wife
and
i
loved
it
the
lead
off
is
this
mild
sweetness
and
the
finish
is
this
wet
bitterness
and
roast
like
coffee
the
midpalate
is
the
creamy
smooth
beer
well
done
this
is
a
perfect
session
stout
light
feeling
light
on
abv
and
very
tasty
it
was
a
bit
too
mellow
for
my
liking
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
robust
this
one
just
had
subtle
hints
of
everything
overall
a
great
easydrinking
stout
thanks
to
duff27
for
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
stout
give
it
a
shot
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
slight
coffee
roast
in
the
taste
a
sweet
to
dry
coffee
roastiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
coffee
presence
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
coffee
roast
yet
thin
for
what
it
is
overall
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
its
a
dandy
a
session
stout
in
a
tall
boy
can
awesome
stuff
here
from
kansas
of
all
places
this
buffalo
sweat
and
redband
stout
are
my
two
favorite
picks
for
stouts
in
a
can
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
geez
i
am
really
not
sure
why
this
beer
gets
such
low
ratings
o
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
the
look
smell
and
taste
are
all
really
nice
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
also
really
high
i
could
see
myself
kicking
back
with
a
few
can
in
a
sitting
buffalo
sweat
is
a
balanced
smooth
milk
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
good
beer
o
a
solid
stout
nothing
terribly
complex
but
might
make
me
rethink
my
overall
opinion
of
milk
stuts
o
an
interesting
beer
that
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
is
not
bad
the
feel
and
flavor
is
similar
to
a
porter
gone
wrong
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
i
will
easily
forget
all
in
all
a
superb
beer
best
enjoyed
on
a
cool
fallwinter
evening
with
a
fire
handy
full
bodied
this
beer
wants
you
to
keep
your
fingers
warm
and
snuggle
up
with
a
book
andor
loved
one
d
a
great
alternative
for
the
guiness
crowd
somewhat
fizzy
carbonation
with
that
milkiness
and
a
medium
thin
body
makes
for
an
unusual
but
effective
mouthfeel
black
coffee
with
a
mocha
head
of
soft
foam
that
leaves
some
trace
legs
on
the
glass
fresh
dark
roasty
malt
and
java
in
the
aroma
charred
malt
and
sweet
cream
with
flavors
of
cocoa
and
fudge
a
little
light
bodied
even
for
a
5
alc
stout
with
effervescent
carbonation
tasty
beer
for
an
everyday
kind
of
stout
overall
an
easy
drinking
easy
to
appreciate
and
enjoyable
milk
stout
o
overall
an
easy
drinking
smooth
stout
tasty
normally
i
dont
go
too
much
for
this
particular
style
of
stout
but
this
one
is
just
fine
my
first
taste
of
a
kansas
brewed
ale
and
it
was
a
good
one
we
need
more
tasty
beers
that
are
5
abv
and
more
beers
in
16oz
cans
as
well
id
say
this
is
even
an
upgrade
from
youngs
flavor
balances
sweet
with
bitterness
didnt
pick
it
for
a
milk
stout
although
it
is
light
of
body
and
quite
smooth
to
drink
airy
carbonation
and
full
body
chocolate
and
coffee
prominent
in
the
flavor
but
little
acidity
sweet
but
not
sickly
bomb
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
brew
an
excellent
sweet
stout
onot
bad
but
i
just
dont
get
much
else
for
flavor
other
than
the
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
good
just
chilling
in
the
evening
or
with
a
few
friends
type
of
beer
pours
a
tar
black
with
a
twofinger
coffee
cream
head
solid
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
delectable
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
notes
super
sweet
chocolate
notes
up
front
in
the
flavor
profile
tastes
like
out
of
the
bag
semisweet
chocolate
chips
a
really
creamy
caramel
flavor
on
the
back
end
with
the
slightest
touch
of
tongue
tingling
hops
at
the
finish
nice
soft
mouthfeel
a
great
sweet
and
silky
beer
without
being
too
much
great
chocolate
milk
substitute
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
to
enjoy
with
a
chocolate
desert
as
it
warmed
the
sweetness
dominated
tallgrass
has
tall
cans
pours
out
that
nearly
black
variation
of
dark
brown
that
we
all
know
and
love
our
stouts
to
be
two
fingers
of
fluffy
sand
colored
head
leaves
behind
some
really
nice
lacing
and
has
decent
retention
for
a
stout
smells
and
tastes
appropriately
true
to
form
of
a
milk
stout
as
well
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
mixed
with
a
very
light
mineral
tone
the
flavor
starts
out
on
the
more
roasted
bitterness
signature
of
a
normal
stout
and
transforms
into
the
sweeter
profile
of
a
milk
stout
while
held
in
the
mouth
medium
body
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
in
a
can
just
a
normal
can
no
gas
cartridge
to
be
found
color
me
impressed
easy
drinking
stout
would
work
even
in
hotter
weather
othis
is
my
first
taste
of
tallgrass
and
it
aint
bad
good
representation
of
a
sweet
stout
i
think
id
still
reach
for
left
hands
rendition
but
this
guy
has
some
nice
roasty
flavor
and
a
killer
smooth
body
o
great
brew
from
tallgrass
it
is
a
really
chocolatey
beer
and
embodies
what
i
think
a
good
stout
should
taste
like
finally
a
kansas
beer
not
a
sentence
i
figured
i
would
say
i
do
however
loves
me
the
sweet
stouts
so
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
the
appearance
is
that
of
a
dark
brown
ale
or
perhaps
a
lighter
porter
it
has
a
deep
caramel
color
but
not
much
more
than
that
the
aromatics
have
a
very
sweet
cornmaple
syrup
aroma
with
some
raisins
hanging
around
in
the
back
the
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
a
good
mark
for
the
first
thing
that
ive
ever
had
from
this
brewery
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
an
addition
of
what
seems
to
be
toasted
malts
and
oats
the
body
is
rather
thin
but
the
flavors
do
a
good
job
of
helping
with
that
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
especially
considering
the
high
level
of
sweetness
that
this
beer
gives
off
overall
impressive
something
for
the
sunflower
state
to
hang
their
hats
on
buffalo
sweat
pours
a
super
dark
brown
w
an
amazing
two
finger
chocolate
head
the
head
is
super
dense
and
pillow
like
and
really
looks
fantastic
very
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
a
little
sweet
with
coffee
and
chocolate
being
the
main
things
i
get
out
of
this
the
taste
is
wild
its
very
creamy
almost
like
a
beer
cream
soda
in
consistency
definite
chocolate
coffee
and
something
else
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
in
the
taste
feel
is
smooth
creamy
and
super
smooth
w
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
not
great
but
a
good
session
lager
definitely
worth
trying
cheers
overall
a
pretty
simple
beer
but
done
very
well
and
very
nice
to
drink
sessionable
the
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
stout
rather
than
a
milk
sweet
stout
still
a
very
good
stout
whatever
you
want
to
call
it

poured
into
an
irish
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
nice
charcoal
black
with
an
oatmeal
colored
head
that
dissipates
to
a
light
film
random
sticky
lacing
stays
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
smokey
charcoal
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
beer
tastes
of
charred
grains
with
a
creamy
sweat
milk
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
too
watery
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
from
my
home
state
starts
dry
and
roasty
and
then
tries
to
get
sweet
and
chocolaty
but
never
quite
gets
there
it
somehow
manages
to
be
somewhere
in
between
an
irish
dry
stout
and
a
milk
stout
it
even
has
a
slight
sourish
twinge
that
many
dry
stouts
exhibit
moderate
hopping
leaves
the
finish
tight
and
quick
not
bad
an
interesting
quaff
to
say
the
least
a
fourpack
of
this
could
disappear
pretty
rapidly
in
the
fridge
tallboy
cans
are
a
good
package
for
a
tasty
stout
d
this
beer
tastes
like
it
should
be
higher
in
abv
but
its
not
i
like
it
a
lot
very
drinkable
but
i
like
to
enjoy
it
over
the
course
of
an
hour
overall
this
didnt
do
much
for
me
the
body
is
the
culprit
its
harsh
carbonation
really
hampered
my
enjoyment
d
drinking
this
one
doesnt
feel
right
almost
like
im
drinking
a
chemical
or
something
i
dont
know
judging
by
their
websites
description
ill
assume
that
they
were
going
for
a
lighter
bodied
stout
that
would
be
easily
drinkable
and
more
appealing
to
nonheavydarkbeer
drinkers
real
stout
fans
however
may
find
this
one
to
be
seriously
lacking
serving
type
on
tap
at
the
blue
door
pub
st
paul
mn
hits
the
spot
for
a
milk
stout
easy
to
drink
and
really
good
love
this
beer
much
preferred
from
the
can
a
real
treat
to
drink
quaffable
for
sure
but
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
some
chocolate
the
obvious
choice
of
the
6
sampled
this
was
2nd
best
behind
the
abyss
and
in
a
virtual
tie
with
odell
bourbon
slightly
ahead
of
brooklyn
black
chocolate
and
bells
expedition
didnt
offer
a
lot
of
aroma
little
cream
a
little
chocolate
but
was
a
big
surprise
in
terms
of
flavors
great
mixture
of
lactose
sweets
roast
coming
in
behind
as
a
milk
stout
id
expect
it
to
be
cloggingly
thick
and
buffalo
sweat
did
not
disappoint
this
is
good
it
does
kind
of
coat
your
tongue
but
a
swoosh
of
water
addresses
that
very
good
stuff
o
i
liked
this
much
more
than
who
i
shared
it
with
it
was
easily
the
creamiest
milkiest
milk
stout
that
ive
had
wouldnt
want
a
bunch
of
them
but
enjoyable
from
time
to
time
bring
out
a
little
more
roast
and
this
will
improve
greatly
slainte
i
really
like
this
beer
the
only
issue
with
a
solid
milk
stout
is
that
often
the
first
sip
is
the
best
bc
it
soon
covers
your
tongue
and
dulls
my
palate
try
this
beer
overall
a
easily
quaffable
stout
not
bad
better
than
i
was
expecting
o
goes
down
very
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
nice
representation
of
style
i
highly
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
definitely
snag
it
again
a
solid
offering
in
a
style
i
pretty
rarely
drink
id
imagine
that
this
would
be
absolutely
delicious
on
nitro
picked
up
a
can
to
try
i
didnt
realize
this
was
classified
as
a
milk
stout
otherwise
i
would
have
been
more
disappointed
i
thought
this
was
more
of
a
straightup
us
stout
than
milk
stout
it
is
very
drinkablemore
drinkable
than
flavorful
maybe
a
good
substitute
for
guinnessless
bitter
than
that
worth
a
try
this
beer
does
everything
its
supposed
to
do
transcendental
and
delicious
while
avoiding
being
cloying
and
remaining
quite
drinkable
simply
put
this
is
awesome
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
not
knowing
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
with
a
name
like
this
the
beer
poured
really
black
and
had
a
tan
head
however
that
did
not
hang
around
for
long
the
beer
had
a
nice
subtle
smoke
hint
to
it
but
was
not
overpowering
i
liked
the
beer
and
will
buy
again
finally
making
my
way
into
the
kansas
beer
scene
taken
me
long
enough
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
bright
dirty
light
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
light
roasted
malts
light
maple
syrup
and
a
general
oatmealraisin
cookie
vibe
very
pleasing
to
the
strils
indeed
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
with
a
touch
more
roast
more
chocolate
a
hint
of
molasses
and
a
vein
of
vanilla
bean
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
stout
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
recently
were
it
slightly
darker
and
just
a
smidge
thicker
and
heavier
this
would
be
fantastic
still
its
pretty
damn
good
now
overall
this
was
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
sessionable
milk
stout
only
ordered
it
because
it
was
the
only
beer
i
hadnt
had
on
the
lackluster
beer
menus
at
daves
taverna
during
homecoming
this
past
weekend
this
beer
is
what
it
is
and
only
what
it
is
it
does
what
it
is
well
if
that
is
that
is
what
you
it
to
be
bottom
line
give
it
to
your
buddy
who
is
petrified
of
anything
darker
than
an
amber
and
watch
him
raise
his
brow
at
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
poured
a
almost
blackish
body
with
semitan
head
that
died
quick
but
left
lace
going
down
the
glass
mostly
toasted
roasted
and
bitter
chocolate
on
the
aroma
although
some
sweetness
comes
off
as
well
somewhat
thin
and
not
so
sweet
for
a
sweet
sstout
but
it
is
good
you
get
some
sugariness
and
dark
chocolate
just
a
little
too
dry
and
roasted
for
my
pleasure
as
it
is
not
as
smooth
and
sweet
as
others
in
this
genre
finishes
dry
w
a
very
lowkey
hoppy
crisp
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
cheap
so
no
complaints
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
that
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
way
the
thinness
detracts
from
the
flavor
profile
o
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
the
next
time
it
makes
around
to
me
overall
its
okay
but
im
not
sure
i
pick
up
any
sweetness
is
it
really
a
milk
stout
overall
good
beer
to
drink
while
putzing
around
the
house
doesnt
require
and
doesnt
really
deserve
a
lot
of
concentration
but
its
still
a
decent
drink
overall
a
solid
beer
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
overall
a
nice
beer
not
outstanding
but
tasty
especially
for
warmer
weather
o
meh
i
dont
think
this
is
really
all
that
bad
but
its
not
all
that
great
i
would
rather
have
left
hands
milk
stout
over
this
could
be
a
decent
stout
for
people
looking
to
expand
their
horizons
a
bit
o
it
reminds
me
of
a
less
deep
sierra
nevada
stout
with
a
cream
and
vanilla
character
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
drink
again
but
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
part
of
the
labor
day
round
the
pool
tasting
session
like
the
previously
reviewed
hoptimus
prime
poured
brownblack
with
a
small
but
sturdy
tanned
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
as
would
be
imagined
bready
with
some
chocolate
notes
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
bready
malty
roasty
semisweet
chocolate
nutty
heavymedium
body
smooth
tasty
and
quite
nice
to
drink
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
rather
easily
i
think
i
found
my
new
favorite
milk
stout
in
a
can
easy
drinking
that
would
be
a
easy
dessert
beer
for
many
overall
just
an
average
stout
would
have
liked
the
flavor
to
be
a
little
more
interesting
not
a
lot
of
depth
in
taste
taste
is
disappointing
much
like
the
nose
it
is
full
of
coffee
and
without
a
whole
of
balance
maybe
a
little
chocolate
but
not
particularly
smooth
it
has
a
full
body
was
hoping
for
a
more
enjoyable
drink
but
its
not
bad
particularly
as
a
winter
stout
nice
body
on
this
milk
stout
it
is
a
medium
body
with
very
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
milk
stout
people
tend
to
go
craycray
over
left
hand
milk
stout
but
i
think
this
beer
is
better
mild
and
creamy
watery
gas
station
coffee
and
nutty
malt
sweetness
flavors
are
similar
toasted
marshmallow
and
watered
down
coffee
mild
sweetness
and
very
mellow
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
light
bodied
easy
to
finish
the
pint
didnt
want
another
thanks
for
the
beer
jr
overall
this
is
a
stout
that
i
might
try
again
as
i
remember
it
on
tap
it
might
be
a
bit
more
lively
in
flavor
an
mouthfeel
ill
look
for
it
drought
for
more
review
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
dark
mocha
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
roasted
and
smoky
malt
and
coffee
also
has
sweet
notes
of
chocolate
taste
has
the
smoky
and
malty
backbone
with
all
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
coming
through
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
the
smoky
flavor
the
flavors
come
through
big
and
deliver
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
the
beer
is
smooth
but
could
be
thicker
i
would
really
enjoy
trying
this
one
as
a
nitro
can
since
it
isnt
too
heavy
it
is
one
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
without
getting
full
overall
a
beer
worth
checking
out
a
great
big
stout
flavor
done
well
beautifully
balanced
and
easy
drinking
stout
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
cheers
im
not
so
sure
i
really
like
the
name
of
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
yuck
but
i
sure
do
like
the
beer
its
smooth
and
sweetish
but
balanced
and
i
love
how
the
berrylike
yeastyfruitiness
stands
out
against
the
caramelish
nutty
and
fudgelike
maltiness
and
its
also
very
toasty
like
darkly
toasted
bread
crust
its
not
particularly
roasty
although
it
does
have
a
coffeelike
edge
and
it
doesnt
have
any
of
the
biting
darkmalt
acidity
that
can
sometimes
be
detracting
the
bitterness
is
limited
but
it
somehow
holds
together
without
ever
hinting
at
becoming
cloying
and
the
hops
are
kept
to
a
minimum
allowing
the
malt
to
be
the
main
focus
i
do
get
some
of
the
milk
stout
sugary
sweetness
but
apart
from
that
its
almost
like
a
porter
or
a
darker
and
more
malty
brown
ale
its
a
little
bit
unique
and
readily
drinkable
well
worth
trying
decent
stout
not
the
dry
irish
kind
which
works
for
me
not
too
remarkable
but
not
bad
not
a
bad
milk
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
away
to
a
ring
a
little
light
and
sweet
in
the
nose
but
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
and
a
light
roastiness
along
with
the
characteristic
creaminess
the
taste
is
quite
creamy
with
a
delicious
nuttiness
and
some
light
roasted
notes
following
a
bit
like
an
eggcream
on
the
finish
and
all
around
very
pleasant
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
just
a
very
pleasant
beer
overall
i
think
its
great
smooth
not
too
big
bold
and
well
balanced
flavors
im
a
fan
this
stout
is
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
but
i
must
give
it
bonus
points
for
drinkability
it
has
a
low
abv
and
even
drinks
light
for
a
stout
unlike
most
stouts
its
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
without
feeling
like
i
ate
a
loaf
of
bread
o
overall
a
decent
milk
stout
thats
quite
drinkable
and
low
enough
abv
to
be
nearly
sessionable
its
nice
to
have
an
easy
drinking
stout
out
of
a
can
o
i
could
brink
this
as
an
allnighter
m
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
stouts
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
though
pours
a
dark
coal
color
with
hints
of
brown
at
the
edges
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
ice
cream
taste
is
a
hint
of
charcoal
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
mild
sweetness
followed
by
some
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
although
the
carbonation
is
a
little
weird
almost
seems
like
nitrogen
honestly
its
weakest
point
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
strange
carbonation
or
nitro
is
the
only
detracting
factor
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
second
offering
from
this
brewery
a
very
nice
refreshing
light
styled
stout
only
measuring
up
at
5
00
if
this
was
readily
available
to
me
i
would
probably
make
this
my
session
stout
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
this
freebee
o
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
that
kinda
works
pours
a
midnight
black
body
with
a
puffy
khaki
colored
head
that
slowly
fades
aromas
of
dark
sugar
and
black
malts
slightly
moderate
carbonation
with
a
lightly
silky
mouthfeel
flavor
is
somewhat
weak
given
the
appearance
aroma
and
name
of
the
beer
a
very
accessible
stout
this
isnt
a
classic
example
but
it
has
some
good
flavors
and
hits
some
spots
nicely
nice
cream
ale
finish
easy
to
enjoy
as
a
single
or
through
the
course
of
an
evening
a
decentlyflavored
roasty
stout
though
it
needs
a
bit
more
body
tasteblack
coffee
dark
chocolate
very
dry
finish
faintly
sour
and
astringent
tastes
more
like
a
dry
irish
stout
than
a
sweet
milk
stout
a
bit
confusing
but
an
o
k
brew
nevertheless
comes
off
as
a
mass
market
attempt
a
producing
a
proper
stout
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
little
thin
but
that
wears
off
the
longer
you
drink
combined
with
the
taste
just
right
for
either
quiet
enjoyment
or
a
session
at
1
99
a
pint
can
a
very
inviting
experience
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
yet
favorable
enough
brew
not
sure
i
would
specifically
seek
it
out
again
but
all
in
all
not
bad
overall
this
beer
just
looks
amazing
i
can
no
say
i
have
tried
every
tallgrass
i
have
found
and
it
is
a
great
brewery
this
isnt
stellar
for
what
it
is
but
theres
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
good
i
like
it
and
would
pick
it
up
again
overall
like
the
other
3
in
the
variety
pack
this
beer
is
barely
above
average
or
just
average
the
16
oz
cans
are
cool
but
that
doesnt
help
make
it
a
better
beer
until
i
hear
differently
about
the
quality
i
likely
wont
buy
tallgrass
again
i
would
recommend
that
you
seek
this
stout
out
it
will
never
be
in
the
same
category
as
a
dl
or
ktg
but
it
should
be
a
stout
that
any
ba
will
enjoy
o
nice
and
complex
for
a
milk
stout
deep
dark
pour
here
black
as
night
with
a
big
head
of
foam
on
top
reaching
a
height
of
around
two
fingers
before
settling
back
down
to
earth
nice
lacing
coating
the
sides
and
making
it
super
sticky
aroma
is
coffee
and
sweet
sugary
notes
hints
of
chocolate
coming
through
now
it
was
an
odd
coffee
aroma
almost
a
dark
french
press
kind
of
smell
which
played
off
the
sweetness
in
the
milk
stout
extremely
well
really
impressed
here
as
even
as
it
warmed
it
seemed
to
never
dull
rich
creamy
feel
almost
as
thick
as
a
milk
shake
creamy
chocolate
and
rich
velvety
coffee
notes
slide
together
perfectly
and
leave
the
palate
soaked
in
sweetness
that
is
simply
wonderful
and
that
is
an
understatement
each
sip
becoming
richer
then
the
one
before
long
lasting
flavor
of
coffee
balanced
on
the
tongue
and
left
a
slightly
dry
finish
soaked
in
vanilla
notes
this
and
their
dipa
are
the
only
beers
ive
had
from
kansas
but
im
glad
to
discover
this
brewery
particularly
since
they
are
canned
pint
can
poured
into
pint
glass
appears
typical
stout
color
with
a
poor
head
and
0
lacing
aroma
is
nearly
nonexistent
although
pleasant
taste
is
flavorful
however
weak
there
are
next
to
no
hops
in
this
thing
and
surely
not
quite
enough
malt
either
kind
of
watery
and
bland
this
beer
is
certainly
better
than
many
macros
however
needs
more
ingredient
to
make
a
proper
beer
it
tastes
good
however
it
doesnt
taste
enough
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
overall
it
has
a
bunch
of
taste
but
some
issues
i
do
not
intend
to
buy
it
again
o
overall
its
an
alright
beer
but
its
a
bit
bland
the
malt
character
doesnt
stand
out
much
the
head
is
very
substantial
but
it
looks
way
too
large
for
a
stout
it
is
sweet
which
is
expected
but
theres
no
real
bitterness
to
counterbalance
it
i
would
not
buy
it
again
if
getting
a
sweet
stout
but
its
not
a
bad
or
awful
stout
by
any
means
o
pretty
good
drinks
really
easy
pretty
much
what
i
hoped
for
out
of
this
beer
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
bit
thin
but
relatively
smooth
drinks
pretty
easily
but
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
the
flavor
profile
everything
felt
a
bit
muted
hate
the
name

the

bitter
flavors

is
lightmedium
its
a
little
on
the

but
also
a

its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
overall
brew
id
buy
this
again
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
a
deep
dark
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
initially
had
a
twofingered
glistening
tan
head
that
slowly
faded
to
a
thin
ring
with
some
lacing
smell
is
stronger
than
the
taste
strong
aroma
of
chocolate
with
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
nice
flavor
again
chocolate
dominates
with
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
and
something
that
i
cant
quite
identify
but
something
pleasant
smooth
mediumbodied
but
not
watery
a
little
different
take
on
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
milk
stout
does
not
have
the
heavy
body
i
expected
very
light
drinking
beer
drank
from
the
can
while
out
on
a
little
camping
trip
and
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
was
loving
the
heavy
coffee
aroma
coming
through
but
i
did
see
something
i
didnt
like
the
beer
seemed
a
little
watery
not
the
tast
but
the
thickness
of
the
liquid
and
i
prefer
my
stouts
to
be
a
little
thicker
but
the
actual
taste
put
that
to
rest
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
toned
down
breakfast
stout
with
the
heavy
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
taking
and
up
front
and
center
part
in
this
beer
and
the
sweetness
and
smoothness
was
outstanding
would
have
liked
to
gotten
this
when
i
had
appropriate
glassware
available
for
use
but
it
seems
to
be
readilly
available
near
me
so
we
will
meet
again
body
seems
a
little
light
and
there
is
not
much
of
a
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
for
the
style
alcohol
is
hidden
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
leaving
the
driveway
the
other
day
my
wife
and
i
passed
a
tallgrass
van
and
became
instantly
curious
as
to
what
was
soon
to
be
seeing
the
4
pack
on
the
shelves
yesterday
we
now
know
poured
a
good
black
color
with
a
small
ring
of
light
brown
foam
aromas
of
milk
and
bitter
chocolate
coffee
and
cream
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
appears
deep
dark
ruby
tinted
black
with
a
light
beige
tan
head
forms
fine
even
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
standard
pint
glass
its
nice
to
have
a
tallboy
of
a
kansas
brewed
sweet
stout
aroma
has
sweet
creamy
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
going
on
with
each
sniff
no
real
herbal
hop
profile
just
nice
sweet
dessert
like
notes
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
lactose
additions
drinks
very
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
chocolatecocoa
and
mild
coffeee
notes
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
and
a
tad
more
earthiness
would
help
dry
out
the
overt
sweetness
a
bit
the
lactose
additions
give
it
a
super
creamy
factor
enjoyable
flavor
just
overtly
sweet
compared
to
most
of
the
stouts
out
there
mouthfeel
is
again
not
to
be
repetitive
but
this
beer
is
super
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
ample
but
works
well
with
this
medium
bodied
session
stout
overall
thoughts
thus
far
are
best
of
the
lot
from
what
ive
had
i
enjoy
ipas
and
dipas
with
the
best
of
the
beergeeks
out
there
however
this
is
one
rockin
cream
stout
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
creamy
head
aroma
is
light
smoke
taste
is
chocolatesmoked
malts
and
light
cream
flavor
is
very
light
and
wateryalthough
it
does
go
down
relatively
smooth
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
once
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
again
this
stout
pours
out
nicely
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
the
color
a
very
deep
brown
with
some
burnt
orange
highlights
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
the
aroma
was
of
some
heavy
roasted
malts
and
a
slightly
soft
aroma
of
some
chocolate
milk
in
there
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
enjoyable
its
got
a
big
roasted
malt
base
and
the
aftertaste
bring
in
a
little
bit
of
a
creamy
buttery
flavor
pretty
interesting
stuff
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
for
this
style
of
beer
pretty
good
though
overall
o
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
special
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
did
enjoy
drinking
the
4pack
i
had
this
is
a
solid
sweet
stout
simple
and
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
drinkability
light
smooth
and
sweet
not
bad
for
a
milky
stout
but
tastes
too
much
like
cola
for
me
i
believe
the
description
on
the
can
that
reads
dangerously
dark
is
a
little
exaggerated
easily
drinkable
and
light
bodied
d
great
try
one
love
how
different
the
flavor
profile
is
pushes
the
limit
of
what
this
style
dictates
drink
about
average
for
the
style
the
only
stout
on
the
menu
to
pair
with
dessert
so
i
went
for
it
probably
wont
go
for
it
again
in
the
future
one
dimensional
its
a
nice
beer
for
a
little
while
but
a
lack
of
balance
and
depth
sapped
my
enthusiasm
gets
boring
pretty
quick
probably
best
to
enjoy
when
you
already
have
a
buzz
going
and
are
no
longer
as
descerning
as
you
were
earlier
in
the
evening
overall
buffalo
sweat
despite
the
can
which
some
people
just
cant
get
past
is
a
decent
sweet
stout
but
nothing
to
sweat
over
cant
say
i
dont
still
prefer
samuel
adams
cream
stout
but
i
enjoy
this
one
o
not
really
a
sweet
stout
although
there
is
plenty
of
lactose
to
go
around
d
overall
a
nice
sweet
stout
lots
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
would
like
to
have
again
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
not
much
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
nose
and
then
hits
a
bit
harder
in
the
flavor
the
chocolate
and
coffee
interacted
better
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
lacked
that
complexity
feel
was
nice
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
overall
pretty
nice
and
enjoyable
m
most
interesting
of
any
sweet
stouts
ive
had
the
carbonation
isnt
crazy
and
it
is
rather
light
not
creamy
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
it
makes
it
much
better
for
a
session
beer
very
dark
brown
tiny
bits
of
lighter
tinges
around
the
edges
head
was
a
nice
two
fingers
of
medium
brown
head
the
head
must
have
been
late
late
for
a
very
important
date
as
it
dwindled
down
before
i
made
it
back
to
the
computer
leaving
practically
nothing
in
its
wake
no
matter
the
aroma
was
brilliant
and
i
quickly
stopped
caring
what
the
damn
thing
looked
like
not
a
coffee
stout
but
fresh
dark
roast
coffee
filled
my
personal
space
big
roasted
notes
and
bittersweet
chocolate
vie
for
limelight
as
well
along
with
sweetness
and
brown
sugar
quite
intoxicating
the
taste
didnt
disappoint
either
though
didnt
wow
quite
as
much
coffee
tastes
were
not
as
prevalent
giving
way
to
more
of
the
chocolate
sweetness
roasted
malty
notes
and
sugary
bits
the
feel
brings
it
down
a
notch
felt
a
bit
too
watered
down
and
lacked
a
bit
of
substance
that
would
have
aligned
the
planets
and
knocked
this
out
the
park
in
the
end
though
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
this
brew
as
a
whole
its
an
amazing
smelling
very
tasty
stout
worthy
of
keeping
at
hand
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
it
compares
well
with
some
of
the
midtouppertier
of
the
style
a
little
bit
more
body
and
smoothness
and
this
would
challenge
the
best
sweet
stouts
the
16oz
tall
boy
is
a
nice
change
and
welcome
cool
name
tasty
beer
that
makes
this
a
solid
purchase
if
the
beer
is
available
in
your
area
d
a
decent
stout
kinda
straightforward
but
easy
enough
to
enjoy
an
easydrinking
sessionable
stout
from
tallgrass
though
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
my
taste
d
very
easy
to
drink
flavors
are
mild
and
not
too
strong
almost
leaves
me
wondering
how
this
would
be
on
cask
or
nitrotap
d
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
stout
but
the
good
overall
mix
of
flavors
and
relatively
low
abv
make
this
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
which
is
a
plus
to
me
good
brew
personally
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
stout
i
e
flavor
body
and
carbonation
i
must
note
that
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
milk
stout
when
i
bought
it
and
have
not
had
too
many
of
this
style
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
compared
to
the
few
others
that
ive
had
it
would
probably
be
better
on
cask
or
at
room
temp
overall
not
a
great
stout
pours
dark
brown
small
white
head
light
lacing
fantastic
aroma
mostly
roasty
malts
and
lightly
sweet
taste
has
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
bitter
roastiness
the
sweet
malts
and
the
nice
malty
background
light
chocolate
and
some
lactose
presence
keep
everything
in
balance
but
i
like
how
the
roast
is
the
star
but
not
overdone
body
is
mediumfull
for
the
style
which
i
really
like
incredibly
drinkable
i
think
ive
already
gone
through
a
case
and
half
of
this
stuff
only
a
few
months
after
it
became
available
here
fantastic
beer
from
a
can
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
others
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
with
lot
of
creamy
sweetness
robust
roasted
flavors
and
some
fresh
hoppy
character
that
added
complexity
and
balance
to
this
there
is
a
nice
easygoing
drinkablility
to
this
as
well
considering
the
heft
of
the
flavors
at
times
another
nice
effort
from
tallgrass
md
light
bodied
watered
down
light
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
any
strong
flavors
d
easy
drinking
stout
flavors
are
smooth
well
integrated
workable
abv
palette
is
not
overwhelmed
by
the
flavors
a
sessionable
stout
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
not
as
full
or
creamy
as
it
could
be
but
at
5
abv
i
think
the
folks
at
tallgrass
did
a
nice
job
not
every
stout
has
to
have
10
abv
and
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
way
it
is
light
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
slight
cardboardy
edge
carob
and
graham
cracker
sweetness
percolate
through
the
palate
light
coffee
flavors
as
well
tobacco
and
milk
chocolate
near
the
finish
faint
bitterness
in
the
end
but
this
is
a
mainly
sweetish
stout
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
thin
feel
pretty
good
but
could
be
better
dnicely
drinkable
more
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
lots
of
b4
mentioned
flavor
recommend
this
one
thanks
barrett
for
bringing
this
brew
to
town
this
beer
pours
a
nice
oily
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
evaporates
into
just
a
inkling
of
a
line
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
no
lacing
and
no
head
retention
the
aroma
is
interesting
astringent
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
tobacco
smoke
whats
interesting
is
that
ive
read
tobacco
as
a
descriptor
but
never
had
experienced
it
now
i
have
and
its
a
bit
distinct
the
flavor
is
a
watered
down
version
of
the
aroma
the
chocolate
is
there
but
its
weak
coffee
flavor
reminds
me
of
the
work
coffee
where
people
only
use
about
12
of
what
they
are
supposed
to
the
aroma
is
enjoyable
but
the
flavor
is
just
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
also
rather
watery
no
body
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
pick
up
again
ill
stick
with
their
ipa
or
oasis
next
time
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
would
i
buy
more
of
it
definitely
ive
got
one
more
can
and
i
will
be
said
when
i
have
to
say
goodbye
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
there
is
probably
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
not
the
best
feel
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
tallgrass
best
selling
beer
and
i
can
understand
why
very
enjoyable
still
solid
brew
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
big
bubbles
dominate
the
head
with
little
retention
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
dominate
the
beer
with
a
more
sweet
flavor
than
other
stouts
finishes
mostly
smooth
with
a
little
harshness
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
good
cold
despite
me
sounding
negative
this
is
a
very
good
budget
stout
and
especially
a
good
one
for
bridging
people
over
to
stouts
this
was
an
ok
beer
for
me
not
too
good
and
not
that
overly
bad
either
i
would
purchase
it
again
but
definitely
not
on
a
regular
basis
great
beer
tallgrass
brewing
value
6
85
for
four
16
oz
cans
a
good
deal
drinkability
is
pretty
good
tasty
but
light
bodied
it
goes
down
quite
easily
definitely
better
the
name
medium
body
tastes
a
bit
watery
it
has
hardly
any
carbonation
this
really
kills
the
beer
in
my
book
maybe
i
got
a
bad
can
if
that
is
even
possible
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
bother
trying
this
one
again
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
stout
pours
a
thin
head
over
an
opaque
black
brew
carbonation
seems
relatively
active
though
as
is
always
the
case
with
stouts
its
hard
to
tell
inky
blackness
being
inky
and
blacky
the
nose
is
pretty
typical
too
roasty
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
mostly
with
notes
of
molasses
the
flavor
is
also
pretty
typical
charred
ends
of
fresh
baked
bread
a
note
of
bakers
chocolate
off
the
back
a
little
herbal
hop
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
maybe
a
little
too
light
for
a
stout
and
semidry
just
a
tad
one
dimensional
this
beer
might
be
better
thought
of
as
an
introduction
to
stouts
or
even
as
a
session
beer
since
it
doesnt
seem
that
alcoholic
not
bad
but
not
that
distinctive
i
do
like
that
this
is
one
of
a
growing
number
of
canned
craft
beers
very
sweet
milky
smoothness
but
ends
with
a
bitter
finish
much
drier
than
any
other
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
chocolate
and
roast
on
the
palate
not
bad
for
a
5
stout
they
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
in
it
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
rocky
light
tan
foam
that
recedes
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
vanilla
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
burnt
malt
there
are
some
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
in
the
finish
with
a
moderare
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
isnt
overpowering
but
it
doesnt
try
to
be
it
is
complex
nonetheless
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
if
you
were
to
give
us
the
object
beer
to
go
with
the
comfortingly
onedimensional
nose
and
flavor
tallgrass
might
have
a
massive
winner
here
for
drinkability
this
is
a
sweet
stout
that
i
could
drink
on
a
fall
or
winter
weekend
all
weekend
even
with
some
major
flaws
i
gulped
this
one
down
and
really
want
another
drinkability
this
lacks
the
depth
and
the
balance
of
maltlylactose
sweetness
that
other
top
milksweet
stouts
have
none
the
less
it
is
still
an
easy
drinking
stout
all
in
all
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
could
be
fuller
could
be
richer
but
this
is
what
it
is
and
its
pretty
nice
id
have
one
again
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
theres
richer
fuller
stouts
thatll
grab
my
dollars
d
a
pretty
decent
sweet
stout
the
best
part
about
it
for
me
is
that
it
isnt
too
sweet
like
some
others
ive
had
unfortunately
some
of
roasted
malts
give
too
much
of
a
burnt
characters
at
times
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
sweet
stout
dmaybe
the
best
sweet
stout
i
have
had
i
could
session
this
for
awhile
as
i
despite
the
sweeter
flavors
i
think
it
drinks
fine
ill
have
to
give
a
few
at
a
time
a
try
because
i
do
plan
on
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
one
would
love
to
a
sidebyside
tasting
with
left
hand
hey
kids
what
time
is
it
nope
not
howdy
doody
time
sorry
its
crack
glug
time
yay
i
initially
got
a
fingerandahalf
of
mochatan
head
but
it
was
fading
pretty
quickly
in
the
face
of
tonights
humidity
color
was
an
inky
dark
not
quite
black
thanks
to
the
deepbrown
at
the
edges
but
dang
close
nose
was
what
did
i
say
about
chocolate
this
was
like
a
liquid
milk
chocolate
bar
save
the
reeses
for
a
dry
stout
this
would
be
at
home
with
a
simple
hersheys
bar
a
quick
diabetes
reading
and
i
am
good
to
go
i
cannot
take
too
sweet
a
beer
as
a
hophead
mouthfeel
was
full
almost
creamy
and
now
i
am
shaking
the
can
for
the
presence
of
a
widget
nope
just
naturally
that
thick
zounds
finish
was
equally
creamy
and
sweet
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
winner
i
probably
would
not
want
more
than
one
but
this
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
with
dessert
may
be
a
new
standby
for
me
replacing
surly
bender
since
it
is
about
2
cheaper
per
4
pack
glad
i
have
3
more
to
enjoy
solid
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
the
head
settles
to
a
thin
cap
light
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
just
what
i
would
expect
a
stout
of
this
style
to
smell
like
balanced
between
the
roasted
malt
and
the
lactose
sweetness
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweeter
than
almost
any
other
stout
and
that
is
what
i
guess
the
brewer
was
shooting
for
some
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
but
overall
this
is
a
rather
tame
stout
the
body
is
also
just
a
touch
thin
in
my
opinion
a
little
overcarbonated
as
well
a
very
approachable
stout
that
is
nicely
crafted
just
a
little
too
sweet
without
enough
malt
character
drinks
well
and
represents
the
style
nicely
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
well
done
milk
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
solid
malty
and
drinkable
sweet
stout
good
session
beer
overall
even
if
there
is
no
wow
factor
probably
would
be
better
with
a
slightly
bigger
body
and
a
touch
more
bitterness
pours
a
black
body
with
a
decent
sized
brown
head
however
it
fizzes
away
not
what
id
expect
from
a
milk
stout
buy
only
a
minor
flaw
nice
aroma
chocolatey
and
roasty
body
and
mouthfeel
are
very
weak
watery
and
thin
hardly
any
body
at
all
not
very
creamy
very
little
carbonation
flavor
is
pretty
dull
as
well
baseline
roast
and
coffee
but
pretty
weak
this
one
does
not
impress
me
the
other
two
i
had
from
this
brewery
did
however
their
canned
ipa
and
canned
english
dipa
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
somthing
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
drinks
easy
but
was
better
in
the
bottle
seemed
creamier
smell
is
a
blend
of
milk
chocolate
and
cappuccino
aromas
the
taste
brings
out
more
of
the
lactose
milk
sweetness
the
body
is
lighter
like
the
consistency
of
1
milk
it
still
has
a
creamy
texture
and
goes
down
very
easy
a
dark
black
color
with
a
fair
chocolaty
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
says
goodly
malt
and
charcoal
with
deep
grass
decent
the
grass
holds
on
to
dominate
the
flavor
with
more
sweet
molasses
malt
theres
lots
of
charcoal
with
meager
carbonation
smooth
and
mediumplus
bodied
and
reasonably
drinkable
theres
some
red
wine
and
charred
oak
qualities
of
the
aromal
dominates
but
the
taste
is
decent
a
nice
try
at
a
stout
worth
sampling
for
sure
d
not
something
that
i
could
have
many
of
in
one
sitting
but
still
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
pours
a
black
color
12
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
decent

smells
of
sweet
malt
roasted

slight
oatmeal
yeast
slight
coffee
grain
slight
hop
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of

fits
the
style
of
a

feel
is
sharp
and
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
oatmeal

slight
roasted

a

roasted

with
hints
of
chocolate
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
nice
roasted
flavor
with
a
slight
thin
mellow
finish
very
high
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
overall
no
to
bad
drinkability
a
wonderful
enjoyabe
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
great
brew
from
the
tallgrass
brewing
company
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
would
be
great
on
a
cool
day
still
good
on
a
warmer
day
buffalo
sweat
is
more
flavorful
than
say
yuengling
black
and
tan
but
the
texture
keeps
it
in
the
same
vein
pours
a
light
black
or
very
dark
brown
light
tan
head
that
looks
good
enough
to
drink
aromas
of
chocolate
vanilla
oat
and
husky
grains
i
dig
it
tastes
of
chocolate
malts
with
lots
of
bread
and
doughy
finish
some
phenolic
bandaidlike
offflavors
medium
to
thin
for
a
milk
stout
though
nice
smooth
lower
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
especially
the
aroma
though
some
minor
offflavors
hindered
my
enjoyment
a
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery
a
nice
little
milk
stout
a
good
nightcap
paired
with
a
chocolate
or
vanilla
dessert
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
id
like
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
chewier
pours
a
standard
black
with
a
respectable
tan
head
about
23
of
an
inch
thick
head
settles
to
a
fine
ring
within
a
minute
smells
of
deep
roasted
chocolate
light
amounts
of
alcohol
mingle
with
creamy
vanilla
also
noted
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
carbonation
is
good
soft
roasted
malts
dominate
the
palate
but
not
too
aggresively
light
amounts
of
sweetness
noted
a
touch
of
creaminess
aftertaste
hangs
around
for
a
while
but
doesnt
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
very
easy
drinking
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
an
unknown
brewery
out
of
kansas
would
drink
it
again
and
am
willing
to
try
the
ipa
from
the
pour
it
is
a
very
thin
beer
especially
for
a
stout
however
the
smell
is
unbelievable
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
it
has
a
nutty
caramel
smell
it
tastes
like
a
caramel
milk
stout
yum
i
could
give
up
junk
food
for
good
if
i
just
had
this
beer
to
drink
for
an
average
drinker
they
would
probably
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
all
night
but
i
sure
can
thanks
geoff
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
very
good
beer
especially
if
you
like
the
taste
of
coffee
the
only
improvement
that
could
be
made
is
to
tone
down
the
coffee
flavors
allowing
the
sweet
maltiness
to
stand
out
a
little
more
drinkability
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
again
might
be
too
much
for
some
but
man
i
love
this
beer
d
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
do
not
think
id
really
want
to
have
this
one
again
that
said
it
gets
bonus
points
for
a
very
creative
name

solid

one
of
the
better
tallgrass
offerings
mouthfeel
is
offputting
very
thin
and
uncomfortable
on
the
tongue
drinkability
i
wouldnt
drink
bottles
back
to
back
but
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
for
the
1
bottle
good
stuff
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
stout
enjoyable
for
sure
i
just
prefer
a
bigger
rounder
more
assertive
stout
ive
enjoyed
the
beer
and
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
the
young
brewery
ill
be
looking
forward
to
new
beers
as
the
brewery
grows
roasty
and
toasty
brew
glad
to
have
the
sixer
brought
to
me
by
my
niece
from
lawrence
ks
d
this
tastes
and
drinks
more
like
a
dry
stout
still
it
is
a
pretty
good
and
easy
drinkingsessionable
brew
liked
this
maybe
more
than
snow
driftbut
it
is
a
little
bitteronly
could
get
at
guus
a
local
tavern
i
loved
this
beer
it
was
pretty
thin
and
drank
more
like
a
session
stout
but
the
nose
and
taste
was
spectacular
really
strong
notes
of
vanilla
and
coffee
throughout
very
enjooyable
and
drinkable
this
beer
was
a
major
disappointment
poured
from
a
tallboy
into
a
glass
nice
dark
body
sweet
slightly
roasted
aroma
tasty
beer
some
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
lot
of
vanilla
flavor
o
very
tasty
sweet
stout
that
does
not
overdue
it
the
16oz
can
is
a
cherry
on
top
of
this
great
dessert
beer
overall
seek
this
one
out
if
you
want
something
that
is
sweet
and
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
cloying
very
cool
beer
thanks
so
much
for
sending
this
one
as
an
extra
regular
buffalo
sweat
is
a
very
good
stout
and
the
vanilla
bean
variety
does
not
disappoint
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
delicious
overall
thus
far
ive
been
in
areas
where
this
beer
sees
distribution
twice
and
i
brought
some
home
both
times
its
a
rather
refreshing
adjunct
milk
stout
almost
what
one
could
term
a
session
dessert
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
im
a
fan
overall
im
conflicted
on
this
beer
the
base
buffalo
sweat
stout
is
fantastic
and
this
beer
has
all
of
the
fantastic
base
buffalo
sweat
stout
flavors
however
because
this
is
billed
a
vanilla
bean
variant
brewed
with
vanilla
beans
and
because
there
is
very
little
vanilla
in
both
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
comes
in
more
than
a
little
disappointing
it
needs
more
vanilla
overall
condor
recommended
and
approved
for
a
small
brewery
located
in
essence
in
nowheresville
kansas
tallgrass
really
has
some
solid
offerings
anchored
by
the
buffalo
sweat
line
i
also
enjoy
the
8bit
pale
ale
the
have
carved
a
niche
out
for
themselves
i
hope
to
see
them
do
well
and
expand
their
product
lines
before
too
long
not
as
sweet
as
most
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
overall
a
very
nice
brew
although
i
still
prefer
the
original
buffalo
sweat
this
was
enjoyable
smelled
the
vanilla
in
this
one
which
can
be
hard
to
pick
out
of
a
stout
the
flavor
was
nice
very
close
to
a
peanut
butter
to
me
better
than
the
regular
version
imo
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
some
vanilla
taste
is
rich
chocolate
vanilla
a
bit
of
malts
somewhat
sweet
and
very
flavorful
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
a
solid
sweet
stout
to
say
the
least
and
an
improvement
over
the
standard
buffalo
sweat
which
i
also
enjoy
the
vanilla
adds
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
though
i
wouldnt
drink
this
regularly
its
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
heavier
boozier
stouts
out
there
my
go
to
winter
beer
creamy
smooth
perfect
balance
of
coffee
and
vanilla
o
the
vanilla
kills
this
beer
it
was
poorly
done
overly
sweat
and
destroys
any
balance
o
a
solid
variation
with
the
vanilla
added
not
overly
sweet
yet
with
plenty
of
richness
o
had
a
tallboy
of
this
in
a
wine
shop
after
a
nice
plate
of
chicken
vesuvio
at
the
italian
restaurant
next
door
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
a
fine
stout
that
i
hadnt
had
before
but
will
definitely
try
again
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
foamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
malts
coffee
and
molasses
but
not
much
of
a
vanilla
smell
the
taste
is
smooth
sweet
and
robust
the
texture
is
lighter
and
not
as
thick
or
heavy
as
the
regular
buffalo
sweat
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
but
its
not
as
evident
as
other
vanilla
stouts
in
the
market
o
this
is
a
nice
stout
so
rich
and
roasty
and
the
vanilla
plays
well
of
the
roastiness
i
just
wish
the
flavors
came
together
a
bit
better
with
something
to
balance
the
sweet
finish
of
that
vanilla
its
alright
complex
yet
easy
drinking
ale
works
fine
with
me
o
this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
i
really
tried
to
give
this
one
a
chance
it
was
initially
chilled
and
as
i
drank
allowed
it
to
warm
to
see
if
it
would
change
in
flavor
depth
and
complexity
all
i
got
was
a
vanilla
chocolate
fizziness
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
batch
but
im
a
little
afraid
to
try
it
again
when
there
are
so
many
other
outstanding
beers
fits
the
stout
family
nicely
very
dark
very
smooth
a
creaminess
to
it
the
chocolatecoffee
taste
is
there
the
overall
flavor
is
wonderful
the
only
thing
lacking
in
this
one
is
the
same
as
the
regular
buffalo
sweat
is
in
the
body
its
a
bit
thin
imagining
this
beer
as
an
imperial
stout
makes
me
dream
it
would
be
worldclass
i
think
hopefully
someday
such
a
version
of
this
from
tallgrass
will
exist
this
is
an
excellent
easy
drinking
stout
with
good
vanilla
flavor
low
abv
means
you
can
enjoy
multiple
of
these
at
one
setting
my
favorite
from
tallgrass
pours
a
bitch
black
in
color
and
is
darker
than
their
oatmeal
stout
a
thin
beige
head
is
seen
with
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
oatmeal
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
coffee
the
taste
is
about
the
same
and
is
like
a
vanilla
latte
even
very
smooth
with
great
flavor
and
creaminess
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
here
is
another
great
brew
from
this
company
dark
as
night
and
impenetrable
to
light
a
good
half
inch
head
of
khaki
colored
foam
rests
on
top
aroma
of
oatmeal
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
theres
a
bit
of
a
coffee
note
present
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
for
what
im
looking
at
the
taste
is
initially
dark
malt
and
oats
and
then
it
quickly
fades
perhaps
it
needs
a
bit
more
body
or
bittering
hops
to
get
to
the
next
level
9
for
a
4pk
of
16
oz
cans
you
wanna
end
a
drought
with
a
solid
beer
you
wouldnt
be
alone
to
choose
a
variant
of
the
fantastic
buffalo
sweat
this
one
looks
just
like
its
progenitor
a
garnettinged
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
slate
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
mild
cocoa
sweet
coffee
beans
a
stiff
vein
of
vanilla
bean
and
a
touch
of
heavy
cream
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
vanilla
doing
what
its
supposed
to
do
and
serving
as
an
extra
topping
rather
than
oerpowering
the
base
the
coffee
shines
through
fairly
strongly
here
but
in
a
good
way
playing
quite
nicely
with
the
vanilla
the
body
is
a
staunch
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
smooth
feel
and
a
nearly
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
one
i
hope
to
have
plenty
of
in
the
coming
months
overall
accessible
not
expensive
and
a
nice
vanilla
bean
presence
in
an
otherwise
solid
stout
base
would
definitely
be
willing
to
drink
again
if
i
see
this
on
tap
enjoy
o
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
love
the
amount
of
vanilla
in
this
bad
boy
quite
tasty
just
how
i
figured
it
would
be
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
rated
it
pretty
high
it
is
outside
of
my
zone
but
if
i
saw
a
four
pack
not
sure
how
they
sell
it
i
would
buy
one
overall
this
should
be
the
standard
for
sweet
stouts
primarily
sweet
yet
with
some
dark
flavors
thrown
in
there
all
without
being
an
imperial
makes
this
a
beer
i
want
to
drink
several
of
in
a
sitting
o
fantastic
beer
from
tallgrass
the
original
buffalo
sweat
is
great
but
the
vanilla
bean
adds
more
great
character
to
an
already
solid
oatmeal
stout
glad
ive
got
three
more
of
these
bad
boys
mouthfeel
is
good
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
stout
but
its
not
claiming
to
be
imperialdouble
and
it
really
showcases
all
the
decadent
flavors
while
still
remaining
sessionable
and
drinkable
dark
brown
color
nice
head
smell
is
in
your
face
vanilla
and
not
much
else
huge
huge
vanilla
aroma
here
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
also
massively
infused
with
vanilla
but
it
doesnt
taste
artifical
like
a
lot
of
beers
with
vanilla
added
it
tastes
legit
the
chocolate
is
also
there
of
course
but
the
vanilla
is
what
really
stands
out
here
extremely
creamy
beer
as
well
the
body
is
not
heavy
whatsoever
that
may
be
a
detractor
in
some
cases
but
here
it
works
very
well
very
much
recommended
if
youre
a
fan
of
vanilla
overall
i
really
dig
this
offering
from
tallgrass
if
this
was
readily
available
in
my
area
i
would
have
it
in
my
regular
rotation
a
very
easy
drinking
enticing
stout
absolutely
love
the
smell
of
this
one
recommend
if
you
are
a
fan
of
vanilla
and
stouts
o
very
nice
stout
with
some
vanilla
to
add
complexity
ill
have
to
try
the
regular
buffalo
sweat
stout
at
some
point
pours
out
really
dark
brownblack
with
really
healthy
head
that
was
really
light
brownwhitish
that
had
really
good
retention
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
and
some
sweetness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
vanilla
taste
is
pretty
mellow
as
far
as
a
stout
but
quite
tastey
definitely
taste
all
the
things
from
the
nose
but
quite
a
bit
more
vanilla
really
makes
it
tasty
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
as
one
would
expect
from
a
low
abv
stout
right
on
for
the
style
really
a
good
beer
its
hard
to
not
like
something
with
vanilla
id
never
even
heard
of
tallgrass
before
moving
to
stl
but
i
must
say
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
pretty
much
every
offering
of
theirs
ive
had
as
i
noted
up
top
i
appreciate
their
base
buffalo
sweat
and
i
like
a
well
done
vanilla
brew
personal
preference
i
prefer
the
flavour
of
vanilla
bean
to
extract
or
whatever
the
other
ways
of
presenting
it
are
it
just
seems
rounder
creamier
oilier
i
dont
really
know
how
to
explain
it
just
that
it
appeals
more
to
me
this
is
a
combination
of
a
good
base
beer
modified
well
i
dont
know
if
you
can
get
it
outside
of
their
variety
8
pack
but
even
if
you
cant
its
well
worth
it
i
mean
ethos
8bit
and
regular
buffalo
sweat
are
also
super
delicious
so
theres
no
filler
there
tallgrass
vanilla
bean
buffalo
sweat
45
neither
terribly
filling
nor
high
alcohol
could
make
this
a
fairly
sessionable
brew
balanced
and
flavorful
but
not
over
the
top
despite
my
normal
dislike
of
this
brewery
this
one
met
my
expectations
high
b
overall
a
definite
improvement
over
the
base
beer
now
how
about
a
double
version
if
you
are
on
the
fence
about
getting
it
i
would
its
not
bad
by
any
means
cheers
the
vanilla
bean
has
sweetened
up
this
already
good
stout
however
the
vanilla
character
is
not
nearly
as
robust
or
decadent
as
one
could
imagine
and
that
roasted
quality
of
buffalo
sweat
is
in
no
way
diminished
by
the
addition
of
vanilla
if
anything
it
takes
away
slightly
from
the
experience
still
vbbs
is
a
fine
beer
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
somewhat
creamy
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
worthy
addition
to
all
the
stouts
i
have
tried
cheers
ointeresting
stout
lacks
body
and
depth
of
flavor
but
enjoyable
a
very
tasty
lowabv
stout
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
its
all
vanilla
and
no
stout
if
it
were
called
vanilla
beer
thatd
be
okay
but
as
a
vanilla
stout
im
a
little
disappointed
another
solid
beer
from
tallgrass
the
vanilla
might
be
a
little
much
for
some
it
was
pushing
the
threshold
with
me
but
delivers
what
it
claims
o
while
i
really
enjoy
the
quality
and
flavor
of
buffalo
sweat
the
vanilla
bean
version
doesnt
add
enough
beyond
the
aroma
for
me
to
get
jazzed
up
over
the
interwoven
aspects
of
spice
and
fruit
to
the
aroma
are
exceptional
but
the
incredible
subtlety
of
flavor
evolution
leaves
something
to
be
desired
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
advance
buffalo
sweat
in
any
significant
way
its
significantly
better
than
regular
buffalo
sweat
i
am
starting
to
dig
tallgrass
anything
this
is
one
beer
that
i
could
drink
to
try
and
get
fucked
up
and
enjoy
it
for
ten
minutes
and
then
pass
out
this
is
still
though
buffalo
sweat
a
dry
stout
which
i
dont
know
if
this
jives
with
vanilla
vanilla
bean
buffalo
sweat
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
lacing
white
head
their
is
a
nice
roasted
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
the
same
a
nice
sweet
roasted
malty
backbone
with
nice
hints
of
vanilla
good
full
flavors
and
the
vanilla
is
nice
and
mellow
overall
a
nice
vanilla
flavored
beer
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
freshly
prepared
oatmeal
and
brown
sugar
a
little
bit
of
coffee
aroma
in
there
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
slight
smokey
flavor
then
some
caramel
after
that
a
hint
of
vanilla
then
a
big
milk
finish
the
aftertaste
is
rather
smoky
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
plenty
of
flavor
in
a
relatifvely
low
abv
final
thoughts
a
good
milk
stout
with
a
nice
hint
of
vanilla
im
not
sure
if
its
the
cool
logos
on
the
cans
or
the
low
price
point
but
tallgrass
brews
always
seem
to
catch
my
eye
in
the
store
id
be
interested
to
try
this
one
next
to
the
original
buffalo
sweat
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
o
a
solid
beer
overall
most
low
abv
stouts
are
bland
and
watery
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
milksweet
stout
the
vanilla
beans
add
a
nice
shot
of
flavor
o
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
regular
buffalo
sweat
but
this
one
made
me
a
true
believer
the
vanilla
beans
smooth
out
the
rough
edges
of
regular
bs
and
intensify
the
chocolate
flavoring
a
new
favorite
tis
good
o
loaded
down
with
vanilla
bean
this
beer
just
pops
and
really
one
i
would
reach
for
time
time
again
the
regular
is
good
in
its
own
right
but
manoman
that
vanilla
bean
is
much
better
adds
a
nice
dynamic
the
coffe
gets
muted
a
bit
but
th
vanilla
is
good
mouthfeeloverall
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the
original
buffalo
sweat
and
i
like
the
original
this
is
a
pretty
solid
milk
stout
and
i
will
definitely
look
have
it
again
not
bad
not
bad
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
mammoth
foamy
brown
head
that
quickly
settled
and
no
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
dark
brown
aroma
has
very
little
vanilla
but
does
have
hop
roast
malt
and
a
bit
of
earth
flavors
like
nose
with
hop
more
subdued
vanilla
coming
out
a
bit
more
well
balanced
in
kind
of
an
odd
way
body
is
chewy
but
despite
the
huge
foam
upon
pouring
a
little
flat
finish
has
an
off
vanilla
thing
that
isnt
an
asset
longish
and
on
one
hand
intriguing
but
on
the
other
not
curiously
weirdly
drinkable
still
trying
to
figure
this
out
very
good
and
easy
drinking
love
this
one
o
this
beer
is
smooth
smooth
smooth
its
smooth
in
flavor
from
the
vanilla
as
well
as
smooth
in
the
feel
everything
about
it
is
just
smooth
that
coupled
with
the
lower
abv
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
not
completely
sure
if
i
like
this
better
than
the
original
or
not
but
im
leaning
towards
a
yes
just
like
the
original
however
i
still
feel
like
it
leans
more
towards
an
oatmeal
stout
rather
than
a
milk
stout
although
i
definitely
understand
why
its
classified
as
a
milk
stout
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
enjoy
vanilla
overall
i
like
milk
stouts
and
sweet
stouts
so
this
hit
the
spot
nice
vanilla
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
nicely
complementing
the
stout
easy
to
drink
and
always
good
to
see
the
cans
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
love
the
addition
of
vanilla
beans
nice
head
formation
over
this
stout
though
it
settles
down
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
very
inviting
aroma
sweet
milk
molasses
and
cocoa
taste
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
very
drinkable
5
smooth
and
sweet
this
milk
stout
goes
down
easily
and
the
addition
of
vanilla
is
a
perfect
touch
subtlety
done
too
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
hand
with
it
this
is
a
light
easydrinking
stout
at
the
moment
id
like
more
flavor
but
if
i
had
a
few
more
in
the
fridge
id
probably
enjoy
it
just
fine
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
the
original
to
see
how
different
it
is
overall
worth
a
try
this
a
nice
iteration
of
the
style
that
hits
most
of
the
marks
depending
on
my
mood
it
would
be
a
toss
up
if
i
drank
this
or
the
regular
version
which
i
enjoy
profusely
what
im
really
hoping
to
see
imperial
buffalo
sweat
a
good
drinker
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
quite
a
bit
but
nothing
that
strikes
me
as
outstanding
i
could
see
the
original
being
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
as
a
preferable
alternative
do
at
5abv
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
packs
the
flavor
very
good
beginner
stout
in
my
opinion
one
negative
is
that
i
dont
find
it
too
much
different
from
the
regular
buffalo
sweat
minor
complaint
though
overall
yeah
they
did
exactly
what
they
set
out
to
do
its
buffalo
sweat
with
more
vanilla
flavor
i
think
i
like
buffalo
sweat
and
vanilla
bean
buffalo
sweat
equally
i
am
not
sure
that
the
addition
of
the
vanilla
beans
really
made
buffalo
sweat
any
better
ojust
like
tallgrass
buffalo
sweat
this
is
a
very
creamy
and
richly
flavored
milk
stout
well
done
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
because
they
get
the
vanilla
down
perfectly
but
its
watery
still
worthy
and
very
drinkable
overall
it
goes
down
easily
it
could
use
more
aroma
and
have
more
body
i
will
buy
more
but
only
because
it
is
a
limited
run
the
base
buffalo
sweat
is
in
my
opinion
a
greatly
overlooked
beer
high
hopes
for
this
one
looks
great
smells
something
like
a
boozy
nilla
wafer
tastes
like
the
inside
of
a
can
the
metal
fades
somewhat
as
it
warms
but
what
rises
up
in
its
place
is
somewhat
bitter
the
vanilla
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
the
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
comes
up
short
where
it
matters
most
taste
merely
an
ok
beer
worth
having
at
a
reasonable
price
o
a
really
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
i
was
worried
that
the
vanilla
would
be
too
prominent
but
it
blends
really
well
with
the
chocolatey
notes
without
being
too
sweet
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
take
down
a
full
4
pack
in
a
night
so
much
flavor
for
a
5
beer
i
just
might
drink
the
whole
four
pack
truly
a
terrific
milk
stout
offering
here
i
highly
recommend
this
one
this
beer
is
one
of
breckenridges
better
offerings
its
basically
a
milkshake
with
alcohol
you
definitely
taste
the
cream
and
the
chocolate
up
front
and
its
pretty
smooth
too
seems
like
they
do
their
best
work
with
the
darker
beers
as
im
also
a
fan
of
the
vanilla
porter
and
the
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
smallbatch
offering
sold
in
4packs
so
if
you
find
it
pick
some
up
if
you
like
this
style
33
pours
very
dark
black
light
ring
of
tan
foam
dark
chocolate
nose
espresso
coffee
too
hearty
creamy
taste
bold
coffee
bitter
swirls
into
creamy
milky
smoothness
not
unlike
chocolate
milk
beyond
smooth
loaded
with
flavor
brew
pours
pretty
close
to
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
just
a
hint
of
rubyhighlights
near
the
top
close
to
a
1finger
foamy
beige
head
is
seen
a
good
amount
of
ringlacing
is
seen
after
each
sip
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
is
of
sweet
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malts
for
the
most
part
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
some
milk
sugar
as
well
as
a
light
hint
of
coffee
in
the
mix
also
very
smooth
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
mediumbodied
with
lower
carbonation
which
most
milk
stouts
have
really
tasty
and
would
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
run
right
out
and
buy
again
but
glad
i
bought
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
on
draft
a
solid
beer
to
say
the
least
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
highly
recommended
there
are
a
lot
of
good
ones
out
there
in
this
style
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
its
worth
your
time
and
money
good
beer
worth
buying
to
try
it
but
not
worth
6
for
12
oz
big
flavors
wrapped
up
and
nicely
joined
together
with
a
creamy
smooth
velvety
package
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
barrels
were
used
for
the
barrel
aging
but
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
bourbon
whatever
the
case
the
barrel
aging
quality
is
subtle
adding
to
the
basic
sweet
stout
styling
without
stealing
the
show
with
too
much
alcohol
heat
and
woodiness
deep
complex
and
wellbalanced
throughout
a
very
nice
stout
pretty
good
id
likely
get
it
again
poured
a
black
body
with
one
finger
head
and
some
lace
a
chocolatey
milkey
aroma
with
some
roasted
malts
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
a
little
sticky
combines
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
milk
presence
and
retains
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
and
balance
pretty
solid
milk
stout
tons
of
sweet
chocolate
honestly
its
like
dessert
beer
perfect
at
the
right
time
and
place
sweet
stout
with
a
little
chocolate
bites
awesome
beer
if
you
just
want
to
relax
after
a
cold
day
on
tap
at
world
of
beer
thick
luxurious
and
very
dark
smell
is
dominated
by
sweet
mocha
and
cream
coffee
and
a
mild
roast
note
taste
is
similar
sweet
creamy
with
a
bready
roasty
finish
mouth
feel
is
superb
very
thick
and
velvety
fits
perfectly
with
the
style
a
great
desert
beer
all
aspects
in
balance
and
not
overpoweringly
sweet
thumbs
up
totally
surpassed
my
expectations
light
body
but
a
great
beer
overall
for
drinking
multiples
at
a
party
no
for
sipping
after
dinner
or
as
a
nightcap
hell
yes
the
reviews
are
not
accurate
for
this
beer
ive
had
just
about
the
best
stouts
out
there
this
stout
taste
almost
like
founders
breakfast
stout
its
great
i
really
like
this
there
is
coffee
and
some
nut
at
first
but
ends
with
a
very
sweet
taste
the
smell
is
superb
it
certainly
is
sweet
in
the
finish
and
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
these
back
to
back
but
it
is
a
great
sipper
for
sweetness
rather
than
strength
its
wonderful
and
smooth
a
dessert
beer
id
certainly
drink
it
again
i
smelt
the
chocolate
from
the
beer
right
from
the
get
go
of
pouring
review
httpwp
mep5urg4fe
very
dark
with
a
strong
2
fingers
of
surprisingly
light
head
smells
a
bit
sweet
almost
malty
taste
is
way
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
and
almost
nothing
else
almost
too
sweet
by
the
end
of
the
glass
feels
thicker
than
it
should
be
finish
is
actually
a
very
nice
coffee
taste
looks
good
smells
good
finishes
good
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
finish
creamy
tart
light
bitterness
on
tap
at
the
brewery
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
a
deep
dark
stout
not
overly
sweet
from
the
addition
of
milk
sugar
and
not
overly
chocolaty
but
the
contributions
of
both
make
this
beer
unique
i
like
that
its
not
overdone
there
lets
me
drink
a
stout
first
rather
than
a
flavored
beer
like
their
vanilla
porter
is
the
accents
are
subtle
and
the
beer
is
rich
without
being
too
sweet
dense
matte
black
brown
in
color
with
just
an
inch
of
tan
head
in
the
stubby
tulip
the
nose
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
coffee
there
but
definitely
grain
first
the
flavor
is
similar
but
instead
of
a
dried
powder
cocoa
on
the
chocolate
side
its
more
of
a
melty
dark
chocolate
still
bitter
but
much
more
silky
and
decadent
the
body
here
is
only
medium
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
through
at
all
i
really
like
this
one
in
a
holiday
context
think
its
far
better
than
some
of
the
other
breck
beers
and
would
rank
it
up
there
with
the
best
chocolate
beers
around
right
now
sturdy
without
being
filling
very
well
put
together
here
awesome
sigh
great
look
to
this
beer
completely
black
with
no
light
at
all
finishes
with
a
chocolate
taste
and
hints
of
coffee
overall
poured
a
2
finger
head
surprisingly
has
a
slight
spice
feel
on
the
mouth
but
still
remains
smooth
overall
pretty
good
beer
nothing
to
rave
about
but
its
good
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
it
its
there
i
may
pick
some
up
pours
an
opaque
brown
black
with
a
frothy
mocha
head
that
lingers
chocolate
and
cocoa
counter
nutty
and
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
theres
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
tartness
and
a
hint
of
tar
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
initially
with
chocolate
melding
with
light
tart
cherry
underpinnings
finishing
slightly
roasty
and
a
touch
bitter
nutty
toasted
malt
waves
throughout
but
chocolate
sweetness
rules
the
day
the
tart
character
prevents
it
from
being
cloying
a
little
short
on
the
roasty
stout
character
and
heavy
on
chocolate
guilty
pleasure
of
a
beer
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
and
a
great
start
for
me
from
breckenridge
i
do
believe
this
is
my
first
milk
stout
also
so
cheers
certainly
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
breckenridge
would
pick
it
up
again
mouthfeel
clean
up
front
lingering
sugar
toward
the
back
and
dry
in
the
very
back
carb
is
fairly
light
o
milksweet
stouts
are
not
a
style
i
often
go
for
but
the
idea
of
an
imperial
chocolate
cream
stout
was
very
inviting
great
body
and
feel
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
but
then
again
i
knew
to
expect
that
decadent
sweetness
and
chocolates
in
creamy
black
ale
like
an
ice
cream
float
great
dessert
ale
it
has
a
richness
to
it
and
has
the
body
of
an
imperial
stout
big
and
full
its
thick
but
not
terribly
heavy
the
robustness
is
felt
as
well
as
the
roast
as
it
leans
toward
the
dry
end
when
wood
and
underlying
roasty
effects
kick
in
more
strongly
than
sweetness
from
middle
to
finish
this
is
a
very
simple
beer
but
its
good
lives
up
to
the
supposed
style
and
yields
a
satisfying
drink
o
like
i
said
new
to
stouts
so
this
was
a
new
taste
for
me
not
my
favorite
but
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
the
smokiness
up
front
was
different
but
had
a
nice
subtle
chocolate
taste
to
finish
off
o
amazing
stout
as
it
warms
it
surprises
every
sip
amazing
o
my
opinion
is
semibiased
i
loath
licorice
with
a
burning
passion
any
trace
of
it
which
it
is
potent
in
this
one
ruins
my
palate
aside
from
that
its
too
sweet
a
little
boozey
and
lacking
on
balance
overall
very
good
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
didnt
think
it
was
going
to
be
as
sweet
but
you
adapt
very
quickly
to
it
i
would
pick
it
up
again
but
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
row
is
a
real
question
to
ask
yourself
salud
pours
a
nearblack
with
minimal
chocolate
covered
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
a
surprisingly
muted
aroma
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
with
coffee
tones
the
flavour
is
more
robust
with
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
milky
creaminess
and
coffee
grounds
bitterness
in
the
finish
roasted
dark
and
chocolate
malt
tones
in
the
body
transition
nicely
from
caramel
sweetness
to
hop
bitterness
theres
enough
dark
and
milk
chocolate
flavours
to
suit
the
name
without
being
cloying
mouthfeel
is
oily
as
befitting
the
7
2
abv
but
increased
carbonation
would
help
my
personal
enjoyment
of
this
bottle
o
this
is
a
good
beer
cheers
o
this
beer
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
it
has
a
good
amount
of
lactose
and
some
added
flavors
of
roasted
malts
to
lend
complexity
this
is
a
creamy
tasty
stout
that
would
taste
great
all
by
itself
or
with
a
chocolate
andor
nutty
dessert
the
sweetness
isnt
overbearing
and
the
flavor
offers
some
good
contributions
from
several
complex
tastes
its
a
little
more
alcoholic
than
its
taste
would
lead
you
to
believe
so
you
do
need
to
take
this
one
seriously
its
a
solid
tasty
stout
all
around
and
one
that
should
satisfy
the
stout
lovers
and
others
among
us
this
has
nice
flavors
that
blend
well
and
drinks
easy
esp
for
the
abv
overall
its
a
well
done
beer
very
enjoyable
ill
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
one
soon
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
light
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
vanilla
and
slight
chocolate
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
nice
balance
with
slight
berry
and
vanilla
beer
is
carbonated
well
and
for
its
full
body
it
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
poured
into
a
12
oz
tulipish
glass
pours
a
slick
black
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
place
and
takes
its
time
settling
smell
is
dark
chocolate
coffee
beans
hints
of
tobacco
and
maybe
a
little
leather
taste
is
mainly
chocolate
and
coffee
body
is
medium
perfect
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
awesome
drinkability
this
was
really
nice
a
fairly
session
able
flavor
able
stout
this
was
probably
the
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
most
it
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
sweet
coffee
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
bean
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
cocoa
is
a
tough
more
bitter
now
its
not
quite
dark
chocolate
but
it
definitely
seems
to
approach
that
designation
meanwhile
the
roast
takes
a
stronger
role
and
the
vanilla
nearly
vanishes
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
stout
one
that
doesnt
overdo
it
with
the
chocolate
and
yet
still
maintains
a
healthy
dessertlike
quality
good
times
taste
is
nutty
chocolate
with
a
dusty
finish
wierd
roasty
for
a
milk
stout
and
does
not
have
enough
sweetness
to
call
itself
a
chocolate
cream
stout
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
and
never
really
come
together
coherently
mouthfeel
is
not
an
issue
here
as
it
displays
a
full
body
and
low
carbonation
not
sure
what
it
is
but
i
do
not
like
this
beer
very
much
i
am
going
to
have
trouble
finishing
my
4pack
wont
buy
again
the
taste
is
good
with
immediate
chocolate
and
sweetness
but
more
than
anything
there
is
booze
for
only
being
7
2
this
tastes
incredibly
boozy
crowding
out
some
of
the
flavors
that
should
be
there
you
get
hints
of
cream
and
vanilla
but
i
would
like
them
to
be
winning
the
battle
with
the
alcohol
which
they
are
clearly
not
the
feel
is
good
and
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
think
i
would
wait
a
little
bit
for
the
alcohol
to
mellow
a
very
delicious
stout
sweet
with
the
taste
of
a
dark
chocolate
o
might
be
my
favorite
breckenridge
beer
to
date
a
solid
stout
that
you
can
easily
kick
back
o
i
really
liked
the
aroma
here
wish
i
could
say
the
same
about
the
flavor
profile
and
palate
feel
while
its
not
bad
it
doesnt
come
together
nearly
as
well
as
it
should
overall
complex
and
a
bit
messy
dont
need
my
beers
this
sweet
want
some
heavy
cream
cheeses
and
smelly
rind
to
go
with
this
dessert
beer
yes
winter
beer
yes
tastes
like
an
aged
stout
not
as
good
as
youngs
double
or
imperial
stouts
i
have
tried
an
agreeable
enough
milk
stout
the
alcohol
well
sublimated
and
thus
a
certain
balanced
attained
however
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
certain
complexity
that
might
carry
this
higher
and
farther
into
ones
good
graces
surprisingly
good
chocolate
beer
from
steve
in
warren
he
added
this
one
in
july
2012
and
i
received
in
december
really
nice
chocolate
pudding
flavour
that
went
well
with
my
chocolate
brunch
dark
chocolate
bodied
with
a
nice
head
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
from
them
this
brew
has
a
slight
tan
head
color
is
dark
brown
with
crimson
edges
has
a
distinctly
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
aroma
with
black
coffee
and
plum
playing
lesser
roles
tastes
of
palpable
darkmilk
chocolates
roasted
nuts
and
dark
fruits
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
that
was
a
bit
unexpected
but
quite
welcome
a
subtle
contrary
woodiness
is
noticed
deep
down
and
the
rebel
in
me
digs
it
medium
to
heavy
with
a
full
on
creamy
body
that
lives
up
to
its
name
has
an
abundance
of
alcohol
heat
but
smooth
overall
mikey
likes
it
the
flavor
is
good
with
nice
chocolate
notes
and
some
caramel
malt
backing
with
a
mild
hint
of
spice
or
the
impression
after
the
carbonation
washess
over
the
tongue
this
is
a
pretty
decent
flavor
of
stout
with
mild
creamy
sweetness
from
lactose
i
am
assuming
the
finish
is
semidry
from
the
sugary
almost
syrupy
aspect
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
the
best
but
it
has
nice
flavor
and
it
hides
the
7
abv
well
o
a
tasty
one
sweet
but
not
annoyingly
sweet
tasty
chocolate
notes
and
dessertlike
thoughts
still
a
good
stout
body
and
slick
feel
o
worth
buying
again
but
not
the
best
ccs
ive
had
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
the
added
chocolate
aspect
was
nice
and
true
to
its
name
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
well
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
this
isnt
the
type
of
beer
i
would
session
it
has
good
drinkability
for
the
style
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
was
just
what
i
want
and
expect
from
the
style
and
it
had
good
balance
the
appearance
was
also
pretty
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
would
be
nice
if
it
was
just
a
little
thicker
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
milk
stout
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
priced
right
so
i
would
buy
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
ive
been
let
down
a
couple
time
by
breckenridge
but
this
one
turned
out
pretty
good
and
i
would
for
sure
be
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
brews
its
not
a
favorite
milk
stout
but
i
think
its
good
and
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
good
job
guys
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
very
dark
pour
with
a
tan
head
and
a
burnt
sugar
nose
the
taste
continues
the
burnt
sugar
but
also
cocoa
caramel
roast
coffee
more
sugar
and
dark
chocolate
all
of
the
right
flavors
for
a
dessert
stout
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
but
almost
too
sweet
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
although
its
a
good
dessert
stout
that
would
probably
be
fun
to
pair
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
stout
glass
clean
brown
pour
jet
black
in
the
glass
with
visible
carbonation
lets
no
light
through
fizzy
dark
tan
head
which
dissipates
leaving
lovely
lacing
and
film
smell
is
sweet
smooth
coffee
and
chocolate
all
in
balance
taste
is
similar
coffee
and
chocolate
bitterness
predominate
up
front
with
a
sweet
silky
finish
that
goes
perfectly
with
the
velvety
mouthfeel
glad
i
tried
this
but
it
probably
wont
be
anything
i
seek
out
again
unless
im
having
a
milk
stout
tasting
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
overall
very
decent
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
beige
head
the
head
retains
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
is
mildly
roasty
the
consistency
is
creamy
and
the
flavor
includes
mild
chocolate
notes
the
finish
is
slightly
astringent
and
includes
a
note
of
alcohol
presence
which
is
odd
considering
that
this
is
a
relatively
low
abv
imperial
an
above
average
stout
rich
flavor
on
the
sweet
side
with
decent
body
there
are
a
few
better
stouts
out
there
for
sure
but
this
one
is
still
worth
trying
and
quite
enjoyable
pours
dark
and
black
cream
colored
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
strong
sweet
chocolate
with
dark
malts
flavor
is
consistent
with
dark
malt
flavor
up
front
vanilla
in
the
middle
and
finishing
with
the
chocolate
nice
vanillachocolate
balance
fairly
low
abv
for
an
imperial
stout
o
nice
drinking
beer
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
as
i
dont
see
much
chocolate
resemblance
as
stated
in
the
label
however
a
decent
stout
regardless
this
is
a
fairly
direct
stout
with
constant
sweet
tones
that
work
pretty
well
not
blowing
me
away
or
anything
but
whats
there
is
nice
enough
the
beer
nerd
in
me
would
certainly
like
more
complexity
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
o
a
really
good
dark
beer
from
breckenridge
brewery
after
their
iipa
i
had
not
really
found
a
lot
of
their
packaged
beers
to
pack
much
punch
but
old
72
does
with
a
tight
package
of
chocolatey
stout
goodness
o
i
like
this
beer
because
its
an
imperial
cream
stout
and
i
havent
had
too
many
of
those
tastes
like
an
above
average
stout
the
alcohol
in
this
was
wellhidden
and
only
at
the
end
could
i
feel
the
buzz
kicking
in
this
was
not
that
sweet
but
certainly
fit
the
bill
of
a
cream
stout
while
keeping
a
thinnerthanexpected
body
and
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
could
have
been
a
bit
higher
since
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
lot
for
it
to
compete
it
as
it
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
fine
in
its
own
as
a
dessert
but
almost
calls
for
something
more
bold
and
tart
to
counter
it
and
help
kick
the
subtle
flavors
up
a
notch
overall
an
ok
beer
nothing
amazing
there
are
better
beers
in
this
category
would
i
buy
it
again
for
the
price
of
the
fourpack
no
there
are
much
better
stouts
available
but
definitely
worth
a
grab
for
something
new
to
try
overall
its
ok
i
didnt
have
to
choke
it
down
but
nothing
id
trip
over
myself
to
obtain
again
too
many
other
better
takes
on
the
style
out
there
imo
lots
of
darkened
toast
flavors
up
front
bordering
on
burnt
slightly
sweet
but
there
is
no
real
chocolate
flavor
here
wellbalanced
presence
of
hopsthey
take
the
back
seat
but
prevent
the
beer
from
being
to
coy
think
porter
with
a
higher
level
of
hop
smooth
aftertaste
of
toasty
darker
malts
rich
body
with
a
spritzy
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
as
a
hophead
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
i
would
call
it
a
good
beer
nothing
is
bad
at
all
a
style
that
i
am
just
not
used
to
but
i
appreciate
the
complex
tastes
that
comes
along
with
it
this
beer
showcases
all
the
good
things
a
stout
brings
to
the
table
overall
an
okay
beer
theres
something
about
it
that
just
doesnt
seem
right
i
feel
like
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
cheap
booze
flavour
but
maybe
i
just
have
a
bad
bottle
d
not
bad
the
elaborate
compound
named
description
implies
something
a
bit
more
complex
than
what
you
get
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
really
just
a
slightly
smoky
chocolate
stout
overall
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
nice
amount
of
coffee
and
cream
although
the
coffee
is
mild
and
not
too
bitter
certainly
a
nice
combination
of
drinkability
and
flavor
for
the
style
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
color
there
was
a
dense
tan
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
lighter
than
expected
chocolate
some
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
some
milkiness
also
the
taste
is
nice
there
was
a
milkysilky
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
chocolate
malts
some
roastiness
a
hint
of
citrus
malts
and
a
bit
of
lactose
nice
good
choice
if
you
like
milk
stouts
which
just
arent
that
common
around
here
o
not
the
best
chocolate
cream
stout
but
a
solid
one
that
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
some
sweetness
and
chocolate
but
dont
like
to
be
overpowered
by
it
say
for
example
choklat
would
have
these
overpowering
characteristics
for
a
lot
of
people
then
this
is
a
stout
for
you
definitely
an
enjoyable
stout
especially
for
desert
bottle
pours
creamy
dark
and
rich
looking
with
a
small
brown
head
aroma
with
big
chocolate
notes
light
roast
and
definite
lactose
presence
flavor
follows
with
massive
chocolate
and
lactoselike
some
chocolate
milkbut
with
a
nice
roast
that
balances
this
out
and
keeps
it
from
cloying
sweetness
this
could
be
a
dessert
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
have
to
be
nice
all
around
deep
brown
with
a
ring
of
tan
head
some
lace
as
well

is
quite
roasty
with
lots
of

some

in
the
finish
roasted
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
medium

smooth
creamymilky
feel
solid
stuff
and
went
down
quite
quickly
something
i
could
revisit
gladly
not
too
shabby
rich
and
decadent
but
it
would
certainly
be
better
if
it
were
just
fermented
with
cocoa
powder
instead
of
chocolate
i
would
also
ferment
it
with
a
yeast
that
has
more
esters
just
with
a
high
mash
temp
to
ensure
enough
residual
sugars
a
friend
of
mine
had
a
car
like
this
back
in
the
mid70s
we
thought
it
was
ugly
but
it
was
built
like
a
tank
this
beer
is
not
really
tank
like
its
a
little
thin
and
watery
with
not
much
carbonation
it
has
a
slightly
boozy
aroma
and
taste
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
taste
hoppy
maltly
not
very
roasty
but
a
bit
very
nice
a
bit
pricey
m
medium
body
creamy
and
smooth
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
solid
brew
from
breckenridge
boozy
but
not
without
some
nice
chocolate
and
cream
notes
maybe
it
was
an
aged
keg
still
was
quite
drinkable
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
it
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
for
others
it
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
for
me
i
could
drink
it
in
any
weather
at
any
time
of
day
overall
i
very
good
sweet
stout
from
a
brewery
that
i
usually
enjoy
o
this
is
a
really
good
milk
stout
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
i
would
go
back
to
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
fairly
pitch
black
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
good
soapy
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
caramel
toast
bread
and
dark
fruitiness
ok
aromas
but
are
quite
muted
and
overly
fruity
taste
of
milk
chocolate
toast
biscuit
roasted
malt
caramel
raisin
prune
and
light
herbal
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
toast
caramel
roasted
malt
dark
fruits
and
herbal
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
pretty
good
flavor
balance
but
not
as
roasted
as
i
was
expecting
with
a
bit
too
much
fruitiness
minimal
cloying
sweetness
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
nice
creamy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
overall
this
is
a
decent
cream
stout
was
not
anywhere
near
what
i
was
expecting
in
flavor
profile
for
a
stoutand
i
just
looked
on
their
site
and
there
is
no
roasted
malts
whatsoever
so
there
is
my
answer
a
fairly
enjoyable
offering
though
onot
a
bad
sweet
stout
i
think
i
prefer
southern
tiers
version
but
i
will
still
get
this
again
the
dark
cereal
grain
red
fruit
and
alcohol
interplay
actually
balances
fairly
nicely
for
the
second
half
of
the
beer
it
feels
like
a
lot
more
than
7
2
though
i
could
easily
guess
this
as
10
a
bit
of
a
drop
in
the
carbonation
could
go
a
long
way
to
bring
this
from
good
to
memorable
smooth
full
bodied
lightly
effervescent
almost
creamy
texture
warming
with
a
hint
of
dryness
at
the
finish
a
medicinal
note
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
delicious
beer
that
does
this
style
justice
tasty
chocolate
stout
aroma
is
lacking
flavor
makes
up
for
it
bottom
line
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
snifter
served
at
cellar
temperature
so
black
that
no
light
would
shine
through
with
a
slightly
brown
layer
of
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
that
it
was
going
to
be
insanely
sweet
but
the
guys
at
breckenridge
do
a
great
job
making
beer
first
then
adding
the
right
amount
of
flavors
that
wont
over
power
what
its
supposed
to
be
great
flavor
with
a
ridiculously
smooth
almost
velvety
feel
on
the
aftertaste
you
start
to
taste
the
lingering
flavor
of
dark
chocolate
a
nice
milk
stout
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
from
these
guys
ive
had
in
a
long
time
fairly
good
drinakability
for
the
style
abv
solid
milk
stout
that
boasts
some
great
roasty
character
and
suggestions
of
things
sweet
sticky
and
rich
o
overall
not
bad
but
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
within
the
style
nothing
i
would
purchase
again
this
is
a
great
looking
stout
it
pours
out
black
with
a
thick
mocha
colored
head
the
head
retains
and
laces
very
well
the
aroma
isnt
doing
it
for
me
its
a
bit
faint
and
im
mostly
just
getting
garden
variety
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
excellent
this
is
really
a
superiour
milk
stout
it
has
great
creamy
lactose
and
malt
flavors
that
pair
nicely
with
the
smooth
milk
chocolate
and
roasty
coffee
the
finish
is
just
like
chocolate
milk
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lightly
carbonated
and
the
drinakbility
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
pitch
black
body
smooth
creamy
light
beige
khaki
head
forms
thick
with
fine
bubbles
even
speckled
lacing
left
behind
aroma
comes
off
a
bit
muted
with
shades
of
dark
chocolate
and
cream
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
dark
roasted
malt
base
this
smells
balanced
not
too
dessert
like
sharp
sweetness
cream
based
with
roasted
malts
bringing
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
mild
coffee
smooth
balanced
and
drinkable
flavors
are
well
coordinated
its
a
very
nice
beer
especially
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
even
more
flavor
bursts
a
hint
of
sourdough
tartness
or
yogurt
like
quality
is
in
there
and
it
actually
works
with
the
sweet
and
lactic
notes
that
come
with
a
good
creammilk
stout
impressive
beer
from
breckenridge
im
glad
i
didnt
give
up
on
them
their
imperial
series
typically
doesnt
disappoint
mouthfeel
even
flowing
carbonation
creamy
textured
medium
to
full
bodied
not
a
harsh
bone
in
its
body
smooth
all
day
very
nice
impy
cream
stout
overall
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
dedicated
beer
drinkers
alike
excellent
quality
from
first
to
last
sip
o
on
the
whole
this
is
an
enjoyable
well
done
beer
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
milk
stouts
but
this
was
a
winner
this
is
an
opaque
inky
black
beer
with
14
inch
creamy
tan
head
that
was
shortlived
the
predominate
smell
is
roasted
chocolate
malt
coffee
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
creamy
mocha
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
thin
for
a
stout
and
probably
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
beer
the
7
2
abv
is
well
hidden
there
is
no
bitterness
i
much
prefer
southern
tier
chokolat
or
mocha
to
this
effort
by
breckenridge
this
was
a
nice
milk
stout
where
i
enjoyed
the
milk
chocolate
instead
of
dark
chocolate
flavor
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
a
light
mouthfeel
made
this
a
very
easy
drinker
brewery
says
it
is
brewed
with
chocolate
fuggles
hops
california
ale
yeast
and
several
malts
pale
munich
caramel
and
victory
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
breckenridge
i
think
from
the
12
oz
single
bottle
bought
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
for
too
long
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
and
coffee
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
molasses
however
for
a
chocolate
stout
i
was
expecting
more
chocolate
in
the
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
its
a
decent
enough
brew
overall
i
think
its
worth
trying
single
bottle
purchased
from
liquor
barn
a
beer
that
is
not
as
interesting
as
the
name
makes
it
out
to
be
give
it
a
try
if
you
enjoy
cream
stouts
but
do
not
expect
to
be
blown
away
o
severely
disappointed
with
this
one
although
ive
experienced
the
lack
of
aroma
and
flavor
with
other
stoutsporters
and
i
havent
rated
them
as
poorly
because
i
wasnt
as
realistic
with
my
rating
system
as
i
am
now
3
is
average
and
this
is
an
average
milksweet
stout
nice
beer
for
breckenridge
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
for
the
most
part
there
are
still
qualities
i
liked
and
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
a
pretty
nice
sweet
stout
that
got
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
a
little
more
attenuation
or
more
hops
would
have
went
a
long
way
in
making
this
a
better
drinker
would
go
well
with
chocolate
desserts
id
love
to
see
this
bourbon
barrel
aged
with
some
booze
and
vanilla
addedin
the
profile
tastecoffee
and
cream
cocoa
a
bit
of
a
hop
profile
leading
to
a
dry
finish
for
a
sweet
stout
not
too
bad
overall
overall
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
with

chocolate
taste
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
buy
a
4pack
of
with
the
added
abv
they
could
have
added
in
some
more
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
dark
khaki
head
the
nose
is
roasty
with
a
moderate
bitterness
there
isnt
much
chocolate
but
there
is
definitely
a
moderate
amount
of
coffee
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
cola
and
slightly
chocolate
syrup
the
flavors
are
initially
a
lot
of
chocolate
syrup
and
cola
with
a
light
roast
in
the
finish
it
certainly
is
a
sweet
stout
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
leaving
behind
a
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
it
drinks
nicely
and
isnt
cloying
its
a
solid
beer
its
worth
a
try
but
i
prefer
the
drier
bells
special
double
cream
stout
all
over
the
board
with
this
brew
great
nose
and
appearance
but
the
flavors
are
a
hot
mess
of
chalky
flavors
recommended
at
the
right
price
of
around
3
5draft
1
512oz
but
i
paid
2bottle
and
i
over
paid
o
a
very
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
nothing
earthshattering
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
by
breckenridge
o
enjoyable
flavor
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
for
this
style
give
me
a
founders
breakfast
or
a
terrapin
wb
over
this
but
id
be
glad
to
have
it
served
to
me
anytime
overall
this
stout
does
well
for
me
my
biggest
complaint
is
in
the
carbonation
which
goes
a
bit
too
far
for
this
beer
otherwise
this
is
an
excellent
offer
from
breckenridge
and
worth
a
shot
for
any
milk
stout
lover
4
pours
black
with
a
34
thumbs
width
mocha
head
that
completely
disappeared
before
i
had
a
chance
to
put
my
glass
down
little
if
any
lacing
rich
and
semisweet
aroma
of
chocolate
cream
and
some
coffee
though
the
chocolate
does
not
shine
like
i
would
have
hoped
kind
of
a
weird
flavor
profile
to
this
throughout
the
sip
there
is
this
thin
but
sharp
sweetness
that
hits
you
alongside
the
regular
flavors
of
some
roasted
malt
liquorice
and
coffee
a
mild
chocolate
shows
itself
in
the
after
taste
thinnish
mouthfeel
like
i
have
come
to
expect
from
breckenridges
dark
beers
overall
an
alright
beer
that
probably
isnt
worth
buying
again
better
breck
beers
to
choose
from
and
far
better
milk
stouts
to
choose
from
overall
it
goes
down
deliciously
smooth
and
makes
for
a
great
sipper
o
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
i
was
worried
by
the
smell
it
would
be
overly
sweet
but
it
is
not
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
well
done
milk
stout
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
as
with
many
of
the
earlier
examples
of
chocolate
stouts
and
porters
the
chocolaty
flavors
seem
to
come
from
the
use
of
darker
roast
grains
and
not
from
actual
chocolate
additions
themselves
newer
examples
typically
use
actual
chocolate
extracts
for
dominant
chocolate
flavor
this
beer
favorably
competes
with
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
and
rogues
mocha
porter
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
deep
warm
sable
with
a
thick
and
frothy
tan
head
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
sweet
chocolate
plus
notes
of
licorice
and
molasses
and
a
hint
of
quality
roast
coffee
flavor
has
firm
chocolate
licorice
and
molasses
notes
plus
undertones
of
caramel
and
coffee
and
is
rather
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
for
a
beer
firm
smooth
body
has
a
good
amount
of
fizz
worth
a
drive
to
the
package
store
overall
very
nice
indeed
soutern
tier
has
perfected
the
chocolate
imp
stout
imo
but
this
guy
gives
me
a
run
for
their
money
12oz
bottle
i
picked
up
for
2
99
dark
balck
color
thin
brown
head
looks
like
a
stout
to
me
smells
very
very
faintly
of
chocolate
tastes
more
like
a
cream
stout
and
im
not
sure
the
chocolate
is
even
noticeable
i
am
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
because
this
was
mediocre
i
just
cant
get
into
breckenridge
brews
at
all
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
but
by
no
means
is
it
an
imperial
stout
of
any
kind
note
to
ba
72
imperial
is
the
car
on
the
label
not
a
description
of
the
beer
im
rating
it
as
if
it
were
appropriately
placed
with
the
milk
stouts
overall
this
was
a
nice
roastymore
bitter
stout
it
has
nice
chocolate
flavors
and
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
not
to
shabby
overall
breckenridge
is
a
brewery
that
well
often
fails
to
satisfy
but
this
72
is
pretty
good
well
crafted
and
quite
enjoyable
stuff
happy
to
get
to
try
this
one
on
draft
and
in
nice
shape
ale
pours
black
with
a
huge
dense
brown
head
that
leaves
all
kinds

felt
like
i
had
to
break
through
the
head
upon
first

of
dark
chocolate

the
nose

sweet
dark
chocolate
cocoa

is
thick
chewy
velvety
smooth
and
super
creamy
overall
very
well
done
maybe
a
little
more
abv
would
have
been
nice
not
complaining
though
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
this
beats
both
the
samuel
adams
chocolate
stout
and
the
penn
brewery
chocolate
meltdown
by
a
mile
flavors
are
balanced
and
complexly
layered
its
a
shame
this
isnt
brewed
all
the
time
bold
but
not
pushy
complex
but
the
smoothness
makes
it
sooo
drinkable
damn
good
fullbodied
with
minimal
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
more
of
a
dessert
beer
due
to
the
heavy
nature
of
it
very
tasty
and
recommended
notes
nice
beer
with
big
chocolate

is
disappointing
but
the

overall
this
is
a
great
stout
that
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
if
it
were
offered
in
ca
one
of
the
best
beers
i
was
able
to
try
in
co
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
the
body
was
very
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
though
it
was
on
the
sweet
side
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
imperial
stout
nice
enough
beer
but
maxs
happens
to
have
the
youngs
double
chocolate
on
tap
as
well
and
this
beer
is
no
where
close
to
that
great
beer
had
this
one
on
tap
tonight
at
the
breckenridge
bbq
location
at
471
kalamath
in
denver
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
little
slightly
offwhite
head
aromas
of
roasted

bitter

and
coffeecream
medium
to
full
bodied
creamy
with
flavors
of
roasted

i
had
had

to
stay
for
another
sour

up

vanilla

chocolate
bourbon

medium

minimal

pretty
delicious
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
overall
not
bad
but
nowhere
near
my
list
of
great
barrel
aged
stouts
this
beer
must
have
got
infected
tastes
sour
overall
complete
mess
of
a
beer
and
with
a
price
tag
of
15
its
a
never
again
buy
fool
me
once
revolution
brewing
very
mad
cow
45
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
looked
straight
black
and
smell
had
hints
of
coffee
taste
was
smooth
and
sweet
made
me
think
créme
brûlée
honestly
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
not
as
thick
as
i
would
normally
like
a
stout
this
alcoholic
to
be
still
a
really
good
beer
overall
but
not
one
ill
be
hunting
down
o
i
bet
id
like
regular
mad
cow
a
lot
but
the
ba
version
didnt
do
it
for
me
id
say
the
barrel
flavors
arent
integrated
with
the
base
beer
so
that
it
tasted
more
like
a
milk
stout
with
an
ounce
or
two
of
bourbon
thrown
in
consequently
the
bourbon
overwhelms
all
the
sweet
creamy
cocoa
and
vanilla
flavors
that
i
suspect
are
present
in
mad
cow
as
this
is
my
third
disappointing
ba
beer
from
rev
ill
be
passing
on
all
such
future
releases
from
them
except
of
course
straight
jacket
this
beer
was
pretty
good
best
of
the
barrel
aged
series
from
revolution
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
holds
a
whiskey
sour
cocktail
tone
strong
milk
chocolate
coconut
and
vanilla
this
is
strong
smooth
and
delicious
overall
i
like
the
bourbon
which
makes
this
enjoyable
but
theres
not
much
else
to
it
overall
decent
stuff
but
not
overly
special
i
remember
enjoying
the
original
mad
cow
a
bit
more
than
this
version
the
milk
stout
has
taken
a
bit
of
a
back
seat
here
and
the
barrel
isnt
all
that
impressive
anyways
making
this
somewhat
mild
and
mundane
still
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
id
drink
another
if
it
were
offered
cheers
again
masterski
o
cellared
for
1
year
i
honestly
couldnt
ask
for
more
great
brew
overall
this
is
among
the
best
bourbon
aged
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
you
are
able
get
it
217th
overall
a
very
nice
beer
there
are
some
clear
distinctive
flavors
going
on
nice
balance
and
not
hard
to
drink
for
the
booze
content
poured
into
22oz
snifter
jet
black
with
a
thin
fizzy
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
into
a
thin
ring
of
foam
smell
is
big
bourbon
fermented
bananas
and
dark
fruit
vanilla
oak
sweetness
and
some
dark
sweet
chocolate
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
bourbon
slightly
boozy
dark
fruit
burnt
sugar
and
slight
bitter
coffee
very
sweet
but
balanced
with
a
perfect
dash
of
chocolatecoffee
bitterness
and
very
slight
alcohol
heat
especially
for
9
5
mouthfeel
is
creamysmooth
and
pretty
full
this
is
the
second
best
ba
stout
ive
had
beat
only
by
bcbs
so
far
awesome
pretty
good
sweet
stout
and
it
has
me
curious
to
how
the
base
stout
tastes
without
the
barrel
aging
sweet
enough
to
be
a
sweet
stout
without
reaching
chocolate
rain
or
dark
lord
levels
of
residual
sugar
though
the
bourbon
notes
were
lowkey
im
taking
that
to
be
a
positive
as
i
was
pretty
happy
with
the
flavors
that
were
pronounced
in
this
one
certainly
worth
trying
i
bet
this
is
even
better
on
draft
m
medium
to
full
bodied
o
nice
bourbon
barrel
milk
stout
dont
get
a
lot
of
barrelaged
milk
stouts
this
one
is
nice
bourbon
is
quite
prominent
but
very
tasty
i
believe
woodford
reserve
my
favorite
bourbon
so
im
biased
interesting
mint
flavor
pretty
mild
but
im
curious
where
it
comes
from
its
similar
to
the
mint
chocolate
flavor
from
the
stone
mint
chocolate
stout
collaboration
from
last
year
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
this
was
pretty
nice
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
but
i
like
it
a
damn
fine
barrel
aged
sweet
stout
that
i
would
definately
buy
again
at
half
the
price
quite
enjoyable
but
the
cost
makes
it
a
one
time
purchase
cheers
o
exceptional
and
underrated
when
considering
the
overall
score
this
beer
is
a
real
find
very
enjoyable
beer
will
likely
be
an
annual
purchase
although
its
not
as
cost
justifiable
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
deep
wood
series
had
the
2014
on
tap
and
remember
it
seeming
a
little
richer
m
medium
body
but
somewhat
watery
at
times
moderate
carbonation
o
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
but
still
a
good
beer
not
worth
the
price
tag
in
my
opinion
the
bourbon
and
base
beer
dont
tango
well
together
and
leave
a
kind
of
confused
mild
product
bottle
purchased
at
the
revolution
tap
room
poured
in
a
fff
teku
aromas
very
boozy
with
some
vanilla
and
general
sweetness
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
appearance
notquiteblack
sweetness
youll
know
this
is
a
milk
stout
i
found
the
carbonation
level
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
very
drinkable
barrelaged
milk
stout
the
sweetness
is
really
good
at
complementing
the
bourbon
and
malt
flavors
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
after
dinner
and
thats
really
its
main
role
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
relative
balance
of
sweetness
and
bourbon
4
a
damn
damn
tasty
beer
that
at
16
bucks
a
bottle
is
worthy
of
a
try
though
splitting
it
might
be
a
good
idea
as
this
isnt
upper
echelon
overall
a
nice
beer
that
suffers
from
a
bourbon
barrel
character
that
isnt
completely
integrated
into
the
base
beer
i
feel
that
a
little
more
time
in
the
barrels
or
in
the
bottle
would
have
helped
the
beer
come
together
better
the
bourbon
character
is
really
nice
though
and
the
whole
experience
is
a
lot
like
sipping
a
bourbon
very
tasty
but
with
some
noticable
flaws
o
overall
a
superb
barrel
aged
stout
so
smooth
and
creamy
yet
having
great
bourbon
barrel
notes
sadly
this
might
get
overlooked
by
all
the
other
bigger
barrel
aged
stout
releases
out
there
but
this
is
one
great
offering
by
revolution
overall
clearly
revolution
knows
what
theyre
doing
when
it
comes
to
barrel
aging
this
is
a
very
balanced
well
done
beer
yet
it
doesnt
do
enough
to
really
stand
out
from
other
options
o
i
was
left
hoping
for
a
bit
more
refinement
just
didnt
feel
like
it
was
completely
integrated
and
developed
a
bit
raw
on
the
bourbon
barrel
elements
honestly
i
was
disappointed
with
the
16
99
price
tag
too
but
i
try
not
to
factor
that
into
my
reviews
o
a
nice
brew
for
sure
but
its
shockingly
light
on
the
feel
which
pushes
this
beer
just
slightly
off
its
complexity
is
lacking
but
it
definitely
works
for
this
beer
the
bourbon
and
the
barrel
notes
are
truly
the
main
players
in
this
brew
if
this
was
just
a
bit
more
viscous
it
would
definitely
be
an
a
in
my
books
overall
nice
to
try
this
one
and
actually
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
the
feel
was
the
only
real
let
down
for
me
this
was
sent
time
from
mjmadsen21
major
thanks
on
this
one
man
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
black
color
with
a
brown
head
on
top
there
is
a
moderate
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
huge
it
screams
bourbon
its
sweet
and
boozy
and
strangely
addictive
the
taste
of
the
beer
follows
the
nose
lots
of
bourbon
chocolate
and
vanilla
with
a
boozy
wooden
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slick
lightly
carbonated
and
finishes
with
some
ethanol
heat
overall
i
loved
it
i
think
if
anything
there
is
maybe
too
much
bourbon
and
it
masks
the
a
dual
beer
but
either
way
i
thought
it
was
great
o
too
bourbon
forward
overpowers
base
beer
i
have
been
impressed
with
both
ba
offerings
i
have
now
had
from
revolution
milk
stouts
arent
usually
my
style
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
ba
stout
by
revolution
i
like
bean
gene
much
better
though
my
biggest
hold
up
is
the
thin
body
other
than
that
this
was
a
great
brewery
only
offering
from
the
windy
city
why
would
you
wanna
piss
a
cow
off
that
much
anyway
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
cake
bourbon
and
a
twinge
of
coffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
cardboard
and
some
mild
roasted
malts
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluidish
feel
overall
a
generally
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
barreling
really
injected
the
base
with
a
significant
amount
of
betterness
but
it
certainly
didnt
hurt
it
very
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks
dsal
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
we
are
fans
of
mad
cow
and
had
hoped
that
more
of
the
characteristics
of
it
wouldve
shown
through
we
werent
disappointed
in
the
least
more
like
we
are
intrigued
as
to
what
this
will
be
like
in
a
few
years
and
what
the
next
batches
of
this
will
be
like
a
nicely
made
bourbon
stout
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
was
still
enjoyable
to
drink
the
bourbon
characteristics
in
this
beer
are
incredibly
high
in
aroma
flavor
and
aftertaste
so
much
that
it
throws
the
base
off
balance
in
a
sense
additionally
it
is
quite
light
on
that
signature
decadently
silky
creaminess
that
is
a
staple
of
milk
stouts
perhaps
its
too
young
of
a
beer
and
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
the
intense
bourbon
will
fade
from
being
overbearing
to
a
pleasing
balanced
component
one
year
has
done
wonders
for
thisglad
i
cellared
ratings
reflect
actually
has
become
more
complex
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
bourbon
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
smooth
bourbon
finish
and
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
really
tasy
and
smooth
i
thought
this
was
a
really
solid
b
a
milk
stout
in
fact
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
milk
stout
from
a
barrel
everything
about
this
was
subtle
but
in
a
good
way
o
a
nice
ba
milk
stout
that
could
use
a
bit
more
time
before
its
really
on
that
said
i
easily
finished
my
pour
and
would
have
again
if
offered
up
o
this
is
the
second
barrel
aged
treatment
i
have
tried
of
mad
cow
and
i
must
say
this
one
leans
towards
dissapointment
while
this
wasnt
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
revolution
has
been
holding
it
to
such
a
high
standard
and
i
feel
this
one
is
a
little
short
of
that
a
quality
stout
full
bodied
with
more
complexity
on
the
aromas
than
the
flavors
any
nuance
that
mad
cow
had
is
completely
obliterated
by
the
barrel
this
time
around
its
straight
up
woodford
with
some
feeble
cocoa
and
mild
roasty
stout
notes
peeking
through
definitely
lost
any
smooth
creaminess
and
sweetness
its
astringent
and
boozy
from
the
barrel
flavors
are
still
good
just
a
bit
harsh
and
bourbon
focused
seems
like
it
would
benefit
from
a
little
blending
with
standardissue
mad
cow
to
smooth
the
rough
edges
very
dark
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
this
is
heavy
on
the
whiskey
and
oak
notes
with
the
lactose
only
showing
up
in
the
taste
and
that
late
i
like
the
bourbonintosugar
development
in
the
taste
but
ultimately
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
much
i
guess
i
like
my
milk
stouts
sweet
creamy
rich
mouthfeeli
was
happy
to
drink
my
snifter
but
probably
would
not
want
another
d
like
this
a
lot
more
than
most
milk
stouts
found
it
very
good
and
went
back
for
at
least
one
more
pour
before
the
night
got
hazy
good
stuff
i
would
like
to
have
again
d
this
stuff
is
awesome
i
went
back
for
numerous
pours
throughout
the
event
i
hope
it
makes
a
reappearance
at
the
pub
soon
and
that
they
allow
growler
fills
t
if
i
had
six
livers
i
would
drink
this
all
day
pours
near
black
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
persists
for
a
bit
before
falling
to
a
thin
cap
the
nose
brings
a
very
strong
bourbon
presence
a
bit
heavy
on
that
and
the
booze
right
now
though
it
is
nice
i
think
this
will
develop
well
it
just
needs
a
bit
more
time
the
taste
adds
a
bit
more
complexity
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
a
bit
of
sweetness
counteracts
the
boozy
nature
of
the
beer
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
in
the
feel
but
is
nice
and
rich
drinks
pretty
well
overall
wish
i
had
a
bottle
or
two
to
age
for
a
bit
another
above
average
barrel
aged
from
cibak
this
is
worth
trying
overall
another
solid
offering
for
revbrew
glad
to
see
them
consistently
creating
good
new
brews
p
s
separately
i
mixed
some
with
kahlua
and
it
turned
into
an
amazingly
delicious
beverage
pours
black
with
deep
tan
head
that
held
fairly
well
before
fading
into
a
medium
collar
aroma
is
sweet
milk
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
but
not
much
else
taste
is
like
milk
chocolate
coffee
water
pretty
thing
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
very
low
the
flavor
is
much
weaker
watered
down
coffee
some
cacao
bitterness
a
good
amount
of
lactose
in
general
the
beer
is
quite
watery
and
lacking
on
the
back
palate
it
however
linger
well
for
6
but
about
as
well
as
the
abv
can
do
d
i
wonder
if
some
of
the
coffee
flavor
has
diminished
i
know
coffee
is
something
that
fades
significantly
with
time
still
tasting
good
just
more
on
the
chiato
side
of
things
overall
good
but
nothing
going
nuts
to
find
smells
great
but
tastes
and
feels
watery
both
regular
and
white
chocolate
were
mediocre
and
this
is
similar
but
with
a
bit
more
espresso
roastiness
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
milkchocolate
stout
i
really
enjoyed
the
strong
flavors
of
chocolate
and
malt
and
the
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
good
beer
terrapin
o
nice
coffee
milk
stout
great
coffee
aroma
nicely
balanced
flavors
of
coffee
chocolate
and
creammilk
very
easy
drinking
due
to
the
light
body
as
well
wish
it
were
just
a
little
heavier
but
im
nitpicking
tasty
treat
i
reviewed
2
beers
today
and
both
were
sub
par
not
great
terrapin
is
a
terrific
brewing
company
but
i
really
did
not
like
this
beer
i
had
to
drain
pour
a
small
growler
maybe
my
glass
was
dirty
maybe
not
i
have
a
rule
to
always
try
a
beer
twice
before
complete
avoidance
therefore
i
will
try
it
again
super
disappointing
was
very
excited
great
flavor
but
ever
so
thin
for
a
stout
theres
just
no
body
at
all
to
support
the
flavor
not
bad
lots
of
good
smells
but
lacking
in
taste
if
they
could
get
the
flavor
up
with
aroma
this
would
be
highly
rated
this
is
medium
bodied
smooth
feeling
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
sounds
amazing
on
paper
but
was
a
real
let
down
in
the
glass
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
reiteration
of
depth
charge
not
even
close
much
better
than
the
white
chocolate
moo
hoo
this
has
the
nice
chocolate
notes
of
the
regular
moo
hoo
with
the
added
dimension
of
fresh
espresso
very
nice
hope
they
decide
to
make
this
one
again
pours

under
a
solid

sheets

along
with
a
good
amount
of
coffee
beans
marshmallows
malted
milk
balls
and
nuts
nice
mocha
flavor
with
plenty
of
deep
coffee
bean
roast
and
less
chocolate
than
the
aroma
chocolate
nuts
and
lactose
sweetness
that
never
gets
cloying
finishing
with
some
lingering
berries
feels
a
little
better
than
medium
fluffy
in
texture
drying
out
in
the
end
very
nice
a
quality
blend
of
fresh
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
syrup
this
is
an
epic
beer
but
all
of
the
moo
hoo
ones
are
i
think
the
coffee
here
makes
a
big
difference
adding
an
earthy
complexion
and
a
richness
to
this
that
just
inst
there
in
the
base
beer
as
good
as
it
is
dense
and
dark
the
milk
sugar
is
anything
but
subtle
bringing
body
and
a
lasting
finish
making
the
coffee
last
longer
than
it
ever
does
so
fun
so
solid
dense
in
feel
fuller
bodied
but
never
heavy
hard
to
do
but
brought
to
beauty
here
coffee
cream
is
the
dominant
flavor
cocoa
in
the
background
enough
bitterness
and
while
some
of
the
special
barrel
variants
of
this
have
blown
my
head
off
i
love
this
and
could
drink
it
almost
infinitely
which
is
uncommon
for
me
in
beer
this
robustly
flavored
and
dark
terrapin
is
legendary
already
but
tweaks
to
classics
like
this
make
them
immortal
average
not
very
different

it

cant

at

its
hard
to

the
good

this
garnered
and
it
was
overpriced
and
a
pain
to
track
down
to
boot
i
would
pass
on
this
and
any
variations
on
the
milk
stout
from
this
brewer
o
nice
coffee
infused
milk
stout
glad
i
got
to
try
a

nothing

very

the

i
like

overall
very

fairly

intensely
flavored
coffee

chocolate
really
shine
amp
up
the
body
a
bit
and
this
one
would
really
stand
out
for
me
i
have
enjoyed
most
of
the
terrapin
limited
releases
lately
and
this
is
no
exception
actually
probably
towards
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
o
a
great
espresso
beverage
overall
every
now
and
again
terrapin
produces
a
beer
that
makes
me
think
the
initial
promise
i
had
hoped
for
this
brewery
might
in
fact
be
realized
this
is
one
of
those
beers
final
score
4
35
o
after
being
severely
underwhelmed
by
the
imperial
pumpkin
porter
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
turned
this
entire
series
around
for
me
i
highly
recommend
you
get
you
some
o
dis
overall
i
was
thrilled
to
catch
this
on
draft
at
fatheads
and
i
figured
why
not
when
i
saw
it
at
dz
six
pack
yesterday
at
a
reasonable
price
around
12
bucks
to
go
o
the
milk
stout
style
isnt
terribly
compelling
but
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
it
worth
a
shot
notes
dated
2014
moo
hoo
you
may
kinda
miss
it
when
you
finish
one
bottle
but
it
still
tastes
like
a
cold
strong
coffee
with
no
milk
with
a
little
hint
of
dark
chocolate
i
found
it
expensive
though
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
sweet
finish
overall
this
brew
is
worth
a
shot
its
not
adventurous
yet
pretty
solid
there
is
no
offensive
offflavors
just
wanted
a
bit
more
sweet
chocolate
than
just
a
cup
of
coffee
with
carbonation
just
my
petpeeves
going
wild
again
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
but
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
its
well
crafted
just
not
all
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
say
try
it
see
if
its
to
your
liking
this

is

a

none

it
reminded

only
toned
down
in

aspects
at

i
would

any

this

its
a
delicious
beer
for
sure
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
and
see
if
it
has
any
more
of

it
is
not
one
of
the

it
is
well

and
a
solid

love
this
beer
but
im
a

guy
so
i
may
be
a
lil
bias
deep
dark

in

with

big

amp
up
the
profile
as
close
to
a
chocolate
milkshake
as
you
can
get
here
there
is
a
bitterness
that
ensures
that
this
stout
does
not
go
into
the
deep
end
on
the
sweetness
scale
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
hands
down
even
though
i
had
it
on
a
hot
sticky
day
in
chicago
in
august
i
wish
i
could
have
grabbed
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
held
onto
it
until
winter
because
if
this
was
that
good
when
it
was
hot
and
gross
outside
i
cant
imagine
how
much
id
like
it
on
a
chilly
damp
winter
evening
o
tasty
and
easy
drinking
it
could
use

around
light
coffee
beans
grain
and
grainy
spice
and
a
light
sweetness
all
floating
in
a
big
luscious
creamy
texture
that
is
a
delight
to
drink
the
flavors
are
rich
complex
layered
and
well
balanced
got
a
weird
smokiness
off
of
this
beer
still
a
fine
if
average
beer
but
surprising
to
find
that
in
a
milk
stout
with
no
mention
of
smoked
malt
or
other
adjuncts
o
not
bad
at
a
milk
stout
but
not
worth
the
huge
price
tag
just
go
get
another
milk
stout
i
think
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
the
flavor
was
just
outstanding
i
would
purchase
again
great
milk
stout
has
a
good
creamy
feel
with
a
toasty
taste
light
in
the
carbonation
and
goes
down
smooth
cheers
minus
the
ultraviolence
of
course
a
big
rich
wonderful
milk
stout
i
dont
even
like
sweet
stouts
but
this
was
awesome
toasty
roasty
creamy
and
sweet
just
enough
hop
bite
to
balance
and
a
tad
bit
of
alcohol
heat
to
add
character
without
discrediting
this
work
of
art
i
love
this
stuff
i
will
be
buying
more
perfect
camp
fire
beer
final
score
4
25
no
abv
on
bottle
but
listed
at
8
here
i
would
swear
it
to
be
45
one
of
my
favorite
in
this
style
for
sure
just
wish
it
was
in
12oz
bottles
or
lagunitas
priced
bombers
paid
12
for
this
one
so
this
is
probably
my
favorite
milk
stout
if
not
according
to
my
rating
its
close
to
it
this
beer
isnt
a
sipper
by
definition
but
youre
gonna
want
to
enjoy
each
and
every
sip
of
this
beer
smoky
and
tarlike
in
aroma
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
citrus
underlies
a
lightly
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
base
with
a
hint
of
lactose
sweetness
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
for
its
drinkability
not
always
the
easiest
to
find
like
all
3
floyds
but
i
pick
up
1
or
2
whenever
i
see
them
o
other
than
my
disappointment
in
the
nose
this
bad
boy
was
done
right
drinks
really
well
for
the
style
straight
forward
flavor
profile
and
smooth
as
can
be
the
moloko
stout
is
another
extremely
solid
offering
from
3f
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
black
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
not
leaving
much
of
a
lace
the
scent
carries
roast
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
espresso
the
taste
is
much
like
the
scent
roasty
with
touches
of
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
full
in
body
and
very
creamy
luv
it
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
solid
stout
very
nice
o
really
sweet
and
creamy
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
sweetest
milk
stouts
ive
had
this
was
so
good
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
share
i
love
sharing
good
beers
but
this
is
one
i
dont
want
to
tell
anyone
i
have
so
i
can
enjoy
the
entire
bottle
mmmm
good
work
3
fs
overall
a
very
good
milk
stout
overall
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
really
nice
balanced
and
not
sickening
sweet
like
most
milk
stouts
has
a
really
nice
addition
of
smokey
malts
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
others
nice
easy
drinker
glad
ive
got
to
try
theres
a
roasty
note
under
the
lactictartness
with
a
full
milkchocolate
character
i
get
an
amped
up
lactic
tartness
atop
a
milk
chocolaty
sweetness
this
is
an
intense
and
sweet
milk
stout
one
for
sipping
and
sharing
a
well
made
milk
stout
and
the
best
ive
had
so
far
possibly
the
best
compliment
one
can
give
a
3f
beer
is
that
it
tastes
like
a
3f
beer
theyre
that
good
this
is
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
stout
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
small
cappucino
colored
head
smells
like
chocolate
milk
with
a
bit
of
roast
slightly
prickly
carbonation
with
a
smooth
finish
creamy
milk
chocolate
a
bit
of
coffee
roasted
grain
with
a
slight
bite
very
nice
and
not
too
sweet
light
bodied
for
the
style
and
pretty
easy
drinking
stout
though
the
carbonation
almost
makes
it
feel
like
a
soda
mouthfeel
is
really
thick
but
its
cut
with
some
moderate
small
bubble
carbonation
gives
it
a
velvety
smooth
feel
thanks
to
smchenry75
for
the
trade
pours
inky
black
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
strong
coffee
notes
on
the
nose
unexpected
but
not
unpleasant
cocoa
and
malt
notes
follow
much
like
the
aroma
coffee
is
the
first
flavor
to
hit
the
palate
followed
by
bittersweet
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
theres
a
faint
bitterness
throughout
the
taste
not
overwhelming
but
enough
to
notice
the
flavors
evolve
as
the
beer
warms
quite
complex
very
velvety
and
smooth
with
a
full
body
and
light
carbonation
overall
although
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
a
well
crafted
milk
stout
fff
continues
to
impress
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
black
with
a
very
thin
mocha
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
mainly
milk
chocolate
and
espresso
some
slight
dark
fruit
notes
around
the
edge
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
heaping
helpings
of
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
much
like
the
aroma
add
to
that
a
nice
hint
of
smokey
goodness
and
very
soft
fig
note
very
drinkable
but
at
the
same
time
thick
very
sticky
on
the
palate
abv
is
completely
hidden
ive
never
dug
to
deep
into
the
milk
stout
world
but
i
have
to
say
from
the
milk
stouts
ive
had
this
one
is
among
the
best
o
3
75
milk
stout
is
my
2nd
favorite
style
behind
ipas
and
this
one
is
very
good
i
dont
find
it
outstanding
but
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
is
an
awesome
stout
its
not
overly
flashy
or
super
unique
but
its
just
extremely
well
crafted
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
they
nailed
this
one
highly
recommended
three
floyds
moloko
milk
stout
4
55
overall
its
definitely
a
milk
stout
no
mistaking
the
style
probably
too
sweet
for
my
everyday
consumption
but
i
can
see
why
it
makes
a
good
base
beer
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
able
adult
milk
chocolate
thick
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
roasty
lingering
aftertaste
that
demands
another
sip
of
sweetness
its
black
as
night
and
is
so
dense
you
cant
see
through
the
beer
a
night
cap
smores
and
a
moloko
i
think
so
touché
three
floyds
well
done
o
very
nicely
balanced
a
great
sipper
and
one
of
my
favorite
dessert
beers
not
too
sweet
but
some
great
malted
milk
ball
flavors
sip
and
enjoy
92
overall
this
is
a
yummy
brewi
bought
it
a
few
months
back
and
even
then
it
was
a
few
months
old
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
pulling
this
out
of
the
closet
but
what
i
got
was
very
good
no
surprise
it
is
a
three
floydsits
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
is
a
bit
light
for
the
class
but
brings
tremendous
flavor
that
makes
up
for
any
mouthfeel
flawsive
heard
this
was
one
of
3
floyds
more
popular
seasonals
and
its
understandable
whyif
you
see
this
one
floating
around
your
local
beer
store
its
definitely
worth
picking
upstashing
a
second
in
the
closet
for
a
later
date
is
also
recommended45
edit
after
sitting
a
while
to
breath
it
did
get
better
o
i
usually
havent
enjoyed
milk
stouts
in
the
past
because
the
ones
ive
had
were
too
sweet
fffs
strikes
a
really
nice
balance
to
offset
the
sweetness
solidly
balanced
but
missing
something
novel
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
three
floyds
pedigree
a
solid
benchmark
this
is
a
solid
solid
milk
stout
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
i
realize
that
is
intentional
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
bomber
of
this
but
i
would
be
happy
to
split
another
bomber
in
the
future

some

this

usually
ends
up
tasting
cheap
but
this
is
very
good
the
texture
is
silky
smooth
and
its
not
too
sweet
definitely
worth
picking
up
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
not
too
complex
just
good
d
the
over
the
top
sweetness
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
solid
brew
this
is
an
older
bottle
and
it
still
tasted
good

its

will
definitely
be
trying
it
fresh

abv
youd
never

better
be
careful
with
this
one
i
had
several
of
these
and

love
it
i
felt
this
to
be
so
creamy
i
experimented
and
made

darn
tasty
as
more
of
the
bitterness
came
through
if
you
like
left

and
i
do
i
find
this
to
be
a

by

could
almost
be
a
smoke
beer
i
was
expecting
a
southern
teir
type
beer
and
it
doesnt
do
that
its
not
the
thick
excellent

of
st
instead
you
get
a
smokey
sweet
thinner
stout
good
for
what
it
is
oreally
delicious
beer
worth
savoring
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
one
damn
fine
milk

packed
with

and
roast
moloko
is
pretty
much
spoton
for
the
style
if
youre
a
fan

this
is
dedinately
worth
a
try
a
great
milk

of
dark

perfectly

by
sweet
chocolate
notes

ive
enjoyed

tried
so
far
and
this

is
a

standout
for
me
along
with
left
hands
milk
stout
o
4

great
beer
and
i
wish
i
could
give
it
a
4
75
for
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
overall
delivers
for
the
style
though
i
have
had
better
it
seemed
to
lack
a
little
oomph
but
overall
is
a
good
pick
this
has
been
a
want
for
a
while
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
without
bias
overall
i
dont
love
lactose
stouts
and
this
is
way
over
the
top
too
much
carbonation
too
this
has
a
great
flavor
profile
tremendous
balance
and
great
drinkability
its
rich
smooth
and
complex
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
o
another
great
beer
from
fff
fantastic
flavors
of
malt
and
chocolate
with
great
balance
and
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
damn
near
perfect
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
beer
tonight
this
may
be
the
best
representation
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
i
highly
recommend
it
o
this
is
an
outstanding
offering
from
fff
nothing
short
of
amazing
o
just
as
outstanding
as
i
was
expecting
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
going
to
watch
a
clockwork
orange
to
celebrate
cuz
thats
how
i
do
o
this
was
a
nice
milk
stout
although
probably
not
my
favorite
personally
id
probably
take
left
hands
over
this
it
was
very
nice
and
definitely
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
trying
it
out
if
you
like
stouts
looking
forward
to
trying
the
cognac
version
tomorrow
o
this
milksweet
stout
is
crafted
to
perfection
as
most
fff
brews
are
they
allow
the
craft
man
to
experience
a
different
version
of
a
stout
with
this
one
a
must
try
for
stout
guys
as
this
one
is
about
the
best
you
can
try
of
this
style
its
all
around
qualities
are
pure
class
and
ill
have
this
one
every
year
its
available
this
one
is
hard
to
explain
for
me
sweet
but
not
over
powering
milky
but
not
weird
or
disgusting
coffee
notes
but
not
overdone
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
balanced
wonderful
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
so
much
i
bought
out
my
favorite
bottle
shops
stock
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
provides
a
sweetness

being
too
sweet

prickly

in
the
finish
verdict
solid
milk
stout
very
true
to
the
style
which
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
surprise
from
fff
as
they
love
to
make
not
normal
beer
nice

and
the
alcohol
is
well

despite
being
a
little
higher
for
a
milk
stout
overall
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
and
i
mean
that
both
in
taste
in
as
a
positive
descriptor
something
about
three
floyds
and
lactose
sugar
just
seems
to
click
i
loved
apocalypse
cow
for
me
i
could
drink
this
stout
pretty
often
if
i
had
access
to
it
regularly
but
for
now
very
happy
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
thanks
again
to
ryan
tut2528
for
this
extra
this
is
a
surprisingly
boozeforward
sweet
stout
whose
alcohol
sweetness
gives
the
sensation
of
it

a
much
bigger

on
top
the
head
had
a
good
retention
and
a
sticky
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
and
sweet
the
taste
is
sweet
very
nice
roasted
malt
finish
with
a
very
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
creamy
and
slick
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
fff
a
very
nice
sweet
milk
stout
i
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
latte
with
a
semidry
vanilla
bean
aspect
popping
up
in
the
background
intermittently
sweetness
levels
are
just
high
enough
to
place
the
brew
as
a
milk
stout
yet
restrained
enough
by
roastedness
to
remain
relatively
userfriendly
for
those
beer
drinkers
new
to
milk
stouts
well
worth
trying
o
overall
i
think
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
i
think
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
even
though
i
find
that
this
brew
is
very
big
on
the
milkcreaminess
i
find
it
well
integrated
with
the
chocolate
coffee
and
hop
notes
it
leaves
me
wishing
that
i
had
a
variant
of
this
one
because
i
think
they
would
be
freaking
awesome
all
in
all
another
fantastic
brew
by
3f
overall
its
an
amazing
beer
its
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
can
recall
everything
about
it
is
first
rate
and
its
got
good
alcohol
to
boot
easily
one
of
the
5
best
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
world
class
definitely
my
favorite
milk
stout
the
burnt
coffee
chocolate
oatmeal
and
bitter
hops
work
so
well
then
add
in
the
silky
mouthfeel
and
its
so
damn
drinkable
im
already
a
bit
sad
that
this
is
only
a
seasonal
and
the
place
i
bought
it
only
had
this
one
served
in
snifter
picked
up
from
big
red
liquors
bloomington
in
i
have
had
this
on
tap
multiple
times
and
bottled
various
times
as
well
thick
head
about
two
finger
with
a
light
brown
foam
black
medium
body
the
roasted
malt
is
what
stands
out
for
me
in
the
taste
also
have
tastes
of
chocolate
milk
and
nuts
the
aroma
gives
the
chocolate
lactose
and
possibly
a
nutty
flavor
a
lot
thinner
taste
than
i
though
the
lactose
help
balance
the
roasted
malts
to
give
a
nice
balance
solid
beer
o
really
nice
beer
and
a
classic
offering
from
3f
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
i
have
had
awesome
bottle
art
as
well
overall
i
have
been
on
an
ipa
kick
as
of
recently
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
exactly
what
i
needed
now
a
perfect
balance
of
sweetness
roasted
malts
and
bitterness
oalthough
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
lactose
the
oats
coffee
and
chocolate
work
well
together
overall
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
its
not
too
hard
to
find
and
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
fff
best
beers
overall
really
nice
milk
stout
will
definitely
get
again
from
bomber
to
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
out
dark
as
night
a
nice
creamy
brown
colored
head
stands
two
inches
tall
taste
and
smell
are
both
very
lactic
milky
a
little
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
cold
coffee
bitterness
alochol
pokes
thru
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
consistent
for
the
style
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
fuller
overall
very
happy
with
this
milk
stout
o
definitely
a
solid
milk
stout
albeit
one
that
would
benefit
from
a
lower
abv
overall
this
is
a
stout
from
three
floyds
that
gets
me
excited
to
eventually
try
dark
lord
pretty
darn
good
this
is
what
milksweet
stouts
should
model
themselves
after
o
got
to
stock
up
on
this
one
again
this
year
pub
to
go
for
8
worth
every
penny
shiny
black
body
and
served
with
a
one
finger
dark
tan
head
great
retention
and
significant
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
the
smell
of
roasted
malt
notes
of
cocoa
and
a
light
sweetness
opens
with
light
roastiness
joined
by
a
mild
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
light
mild
malted
milk
balllike
sweetness
that
is
perfectly
balanced
with
roasted
malt
medium
to
fullbodied
extremely
creamy
and
silky
smooth
in
my
opinion
moloko
sets
a
standard
for
milk
stouts
extremely
balanced
between
sweetness
and
roastiness
with
a
velvetly
smooth
presence
on
the
palate
just
remember
it
certainly
packs
a
punch
with
an
undetectable
8
abv
higher
than
might
be
expected
especially
for
a
milk
stout
its
exceptional
drinkability
can
make
moloko
deliciously
dangerous
overall
very
complex
and
well
balanced
and
each
flavor
is
well
represnted
perfect
degree
of
sweetness
this
is
an
excellent
mill
stout
o
this
beer
has
a
flavor
that
is
very
unique
to
three
floyds
which
i
also
found
to
a
small
degree
in
darklord
very
tasty
milk
stout
had
during
the
2nd
annual
redneck
racin
tastin
while
tailgating
at
the
dirt
track
race
big
thanks
goes
out
to
jzmhector
for
this
one
2011
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
noda
snifter
poured
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sugar
cream
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
dark
chocolate
and
milk
chocolate
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
this
brew
is
what
i
think
of
when
someone
asks
me
to
describe
a
good
milk
stout
all
of
the
right
flavors
are
there
in
all
the
right
intensities
and
balances
i
really
wish
that
would
have
tossed
something
into
this
one
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
really
great
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
o
well
now
this
one
was
way
better
than
i
expected
seems
they
added
some
oatmeal
which
gives
it
a
nice
silky
smooth
heartiness
feels
bigger
than
it
actually
is
in
fact
i
happen
to
love
sweetmilk
stouts
chocolate
stouts
and
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
all
three
in
one
its
got
a
perfectly
balanced
sweet
creamy
chocolate
character
to
it
easily
the
top
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
bravo
three
floyds
o
special
delicious
taste
drink
well
and
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
hard
to
find
o
overall
a
great
beer
from
the
3
floyds
brew
crew
loved
it
and
left
me
wanting
another
o
unique
and
delicious
take
on
a
style
i
dont
see
enough
of
pretty
delicious
brew
well
crafted
flavors
that
play
well
with
each
other
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
fff
pulled
it
off
pretty
well
overall
impression
very
nice
brew
by
fff
well
blended
and
didnt
overpower
me
with
hops
the
creaminess
was
my
favorite
part
of
this
brew
im
not
sure
when
this
was
brewed
but
would
love
to
find
again
o
aside
from
a
knock
you
out
amazing
smell
this
one
lacks
the
lushness
for
me
very
glad
i
got
the
taste
but
not
a
stand
out
beer
from
three
floyds
in
my
opinion
dark

the

of

really
nice
and
creamy
stout
three
floyds
continues
to
impress
o
i
have
wanted
to
try
a
three
floyds
beer
for
so
long
i
never
thought
this
day
would
come
and
now
here
it
is
and
it
is
so
good
this
is
the
best
commercial
milk
stout
i
have
had
hands
down
if
you
can
get
it
get
it
o
had
been
holding
onto
this
bottle
for
awhile
and
just
randomly
opened
it
the
other
night
really
really
impressed
thought
it
was
going
to
be
just
average
d
highly
drinkable
not
a
trace
of
the
8
abv
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
starts
out
a
bit
sweet
and
is
met
with
the
roasted
feel
immediately
this
is
a
nice
milk
stout
fff
moloko
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
their
standouts
has
a
subdued
imperialstout
taste
nutty
roasty
grainy
in
a
good
way
not
bad
at
all
i
could
drink
this
all
day
all
morning
anyway
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
the
fermentation
allowed
for
the
production
of
ethanol
which
when
consumed
along
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
constituents
intoxicated
me
reminds
me
of
a
liquid
whopper
candy
its
easy
drinking
with
a
terrific
mouthfeel
making
for
a
very
solid
milk
stout
very
drinkable
and
delicious
creamy
milk
stout
with
some
roast
to
it
o
a
very
nicely
done
imperial
milk
stout
very
high
drinkability
showcases
the
malts
and
dark
fruit
character
of
this
beer
overall
i
honestly
am
not
impressed
with
this
beer
i
found
the
flavor
profile
a
bit
muddled
and
sweet
to
the
point
that
it
was
a
more
distracting
than
it
was
good
i
am
however
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
o
i
like
this
great
balance
enjoyable
flavors
fantastic
mouthfeel
do
this
stout
is
fairly
decadent
without
feeling
overpowering
on
the
palate
chocolate
and
sweetness
are
major
themes
here
offering
dessertpairing
opportunities
without
the
usual
attendant
heavy
booze
presence
of
russian
imperial
stouts
score
for
flavor
may
have
been
even
higher
if
acidity
had
a
smaller
presence
but
the
overall
taste
is
still
strongly
positive
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
having
this
but
it
would
take
a
lot
for
me
to
try
this
again
i
ended
up
giving
my
glass
to
my
husband
who
just
ended
up
pouring
it
out
does
not
taste
smell
or
feel
like
a
milk
stout
in
any
way
very
disappointed
this
is
a
damn
fine
milk
stout
i
would
just
consider
this
an
imperial
stout
but
either
way
it
is
quite
good
i
really
like
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
and
this
one
does
it
nicely
nicely
warming
fullbodied
with
a
nice
light
effervescence
overall
a
style
that
i
havnt
had
alot
of
that
being
said
this
is
a
very
good
beeronce
again
fff
doesnt
dissapoint
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
moloko
matches
up
well
with
many
of
the
qualities
i
like
in
stouts
the
8
isnt
perceptible
and
i
could
happily
session
this
brew
another
winner
from
three
floyds
wish
it
were
available
more
than
once
per
year
o
an
excellent
easydrinking
stout
the
8
abv
was
masked
well
highly
recommend
overall
im
really
impressed
three
floyds
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
and
this
beer
is
at
the
top
of
its
category
the
mouthfeel
strikes
me
initially
as
a
bit
thin
but
i
have
to
remember
that
this
isnt
an
imperial
stout
not
truly
its
just
so
flavorful
that
i
want
to
treat
it
like
a
crazy
imperial
stout
overall
this
is
one
of
the
absolute
best
examples
of
the
milksweet
stout
style
that
we
have
the
sweet
coffee
flavor
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
no
trace
of
the
8
overall
an
excellent
milk
stout
i
love
how
drinkable
this
style
is
and
wish
more
brewers
did
it
although
not
sure
they
could
match
this
effort
by
tf
overall
an
exquisite
stout
with
the
flavors
contributing
to
each
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
a
truly
delightful
drinking
experience
o
this
should
be
called
a
chocolate
milk
stout
very
smooth
rich
creamy
and
extremely
drinkable
thanks
again
cy
for
send
this
one
my
way
moloko
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
the
smell
has
alot
coffe
flavors
strong
choclate
flavors
almost
sweet
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
sweet
creamy
nice
choclate
flavors
very
rich
there
is
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
milk
stout
very
enjoyable
o
as
i
mentioned
a
really
well
made
milk
stout
works
nicely
and
is
really
well
made
no
complaints
with
it
yet
not
the
most
amazing
beer
ive
ever
had
works
nicely
together
overall
a
supreme
milk
stout
tastes
like
a
smore
and
it
goes
down
waaayyy
too
easy
o
a
very
flavorful
beer
really
enjoyable
on
a
cool
fall
night
im
not
sure
why
this
is
a
seasonal
though
i
would
love
to
drink
this
stuff
year
round
nicely
done
poured
from
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
typical
jet
black
with
roughly
a
2
crown
at
the
top
scent
is
both
smokey
and
sweet
some
burnt
caramel
and
sugar
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
and
smokey
burnt
sugars
and
fruit
dominate
the
palate
im
not
quite
getting
the
milk
part
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
despite
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
likely
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
cheers
o
fresh
pour
starts
off
good
but
goes
down
hill
a
bit
when
it
warms
up
o
the
flavors
on
this
beer
leave
your
mozg
all
razrezzed
i
mean
this
beer
gives
you
a
solid
tolchok
full
on
the
rot
with
its
ringy
rooker
my
humble
appypolly
loggies
for
the
chepooka
nadsat
but
seriously
this
beer
is
sodding
delicious
im
not
big
on
milk
stouts
but
the
flavor
on
this
beer
is
done
perfectly
and
is
highly
drinkable
i
cant
even
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
on
nitro
but
really
people
who
dont
try
this
truly
outstanding
beer
should
end
up
in
the
staja

a
big
fan
of
beers
from

this
beer
lived
up
to
my

i
really
liked
this
beer

a
nice
blend
with
the
coffee

complaint
is
that
it

little
thin
feel
to
it
a
very
good
milk
stout
very
solid
for
the
style
overall
i
really
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
was
let
down
just
a
bit
i
know
that
this
is
a
milk
stout
but
i
was
expecting
more
than
just
the
lactose
sugar
not
very
complex
at
all
not
a
bad
pick
up
if
you
can
though
thanks
to
cruisac
for
this
trade
o
nice
milk
stout
the
taste
is
nice
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
off
to
me
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
but
woudnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
set
uo
a
trade
for
it
o
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
milk
stout
the
sweetness
is
definitely
there
but
the
beer
is
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
hops
solid
milk
stout
real
horrorshow
quite
sweet
and
one
of
the
best
brews
my
droogs
and
i
peeted
that
evening
couldnt
keep
me
rookers
off
it
cant
wait
to
try
the
starry
old
barrel
aged
version
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
milk
stout
creamy
malty
thick
and
dark
the
extra
bit
of
sweetness
at
the
end
pairs
wonderfully
with
chocolates
and
desserts
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
my
class
had
collected
streaks
of
foam
the
whole
way
down
a
sure
sign
of
proper
carbonation
drinks
painfully
easy
with
no
sign
of
the
8
abv
overall
this
stout
goes
down
exceptionally
smooth
but
seems
overly
sweetened
not
a
huge
fan
of
milk
stouts
in
general
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
quaffable
o
buy
it
if
you
see
it
excellent
milk
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
as
creamy
as
bells
double
cream
stout
and
without
the
slightest
taste
of
it
8
abv
its
combination
of
strong
sweetness
rich
maltiness
and
creamy
feel
is
hard
to
match
in
this
style
o
good
beer
nice
taste
pretty
easy
to
get
down
probably
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
had
d
to
tell
you
the
truth
im
not
really
much
of
a
sweet
stout
fan
but
i
must
say
that
this
was
truly
an
enjoyable
drink
great
blend
of
roasted
malt
and
lactose
flavors
keep
this
beer
full
of
character
and
palate
excitement
o
i
generally
find
milk
stouts
to
be
too
thin
but
this
one
is
very
nice
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
but
not
cloyingly
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
nice
and
drinkable
for
an
8er
well
done
overall
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
lactose
flavor
a
great
milk
stout
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smoothdrinking
beer
the
body
is
coating
and
just
a
tad
sticky
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
but
does
well
to
give
this
beer
a
nicely
creamy
mouthfeel
cheers
moloko
pours
a
stout
black
with
a
viscous
tan
crown
of
foam
perched
three
fingers
high
atop
the
beer
it
just
sits
there
for
a
minute
and
looks
like
a
chunk
of
caramel
colored
cake
theres
a
pretty
nice
ring
of
lace
that
shows
where
the
beer
hit
its
high
point
but
lacing
is
a
bit
spotty
below
that
the
nose
takes
a
minute
to
really
start
to
shine
through
but
when
it
does
it
smells
like
what
id
imagine
a
good
strong
coffee
does
after
its
been
cut
with
some
cream
and
sugar
the
flavor
carries
that
same
general
idea
theres
a
sugary
creamy
edge
to
the
coffee
flavor
too
much
so
in
fact
its
almost
as
if
vanilla
is
the
primary
flavor
here
and
coffee
is
just
a
supporting
player
when
it
should
be
the
other
way
around
the
body
is
superbly
creamy
with
a
nice
low
level
of
carbonation
that
stays
out
of
the
way
the
result
is
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
beer
almost
like
drinking
a
dessert
i
dont
know
theres
just
a
touch
too
much
lactose
or
its
something
else
but
moloko
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
that
could
be
great
if
a
bit
more
roasty
flavors
come
through
i
just
opened
one
of
these
this
beers
name
is
a
reference
to
the
stanley
kubrick
movie
a
clockwork
orange
i
didnt
expect
to
see
one
today
let
alone
buy
two
its
a
very
drinkable
complex
moloko
is
a
rare
commodity
they
got
their
new
shipment
this
week
the
first
two
cases
in
six
months
and
half
the
total
stock
is
already
gone
if
they
have
any
next
week
im
buying
more
d
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
milk
stout
not
quite
as
good
as
moo
hoo
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
detracts
a
bit
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
made
it
to
my
want
list
probably
from
searches
for
sweet
beers
lacking
hop
bitterness
it
certainly
fit
those
requirements
i
taste
a
simple
sweetness
which
i
actually
dont
care
for
its
like
sugar
cubes
were
diluted
into
the
beer
prior
to
bottling
i
also
taste
a
roasted
flavor
but
thats
about
it
i
was
expecting
some
other
flavors
sneaking
in
to
provide
some
complexity
nope
too
bad
o
i
havent
had
many
milk
stouts
but
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
fff
sweetness
was
not
overwhelming
which
was
good
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
next
time
o
solid
sweet
stout
plenty
of
flavors
nothing
too
out
of
the
norm
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
they
really
did
a
great
job
blending
all
the
flavors
and
closing
on
a
dark
fruit
note
overall
this
is
quite
nice
but
my
opinion
of
it
has
changed
a
little
for
the
worse
since
my
bottle
review
maybe
there
is
a
batch
variation
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
in
either
case
i
likethis
beer
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
i
did
dark
color
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
smell
is
surprisingly
ale
like
but
heavier
initial
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
hint
of
coffee
to
me
the
mouth
feel
is
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
with
a
milk
stout
i
think
it
has
to
much
of
a
carbonation
kick
and
not
as
creamy
as
for
the
final
taste
the
finish
is
very
good
with
a
lingering
taste
of
chocolate
and
coffee
that
is
very
smooth
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
o
another
impressive
beer
from
fff
a
great
flavor
profile
with
the
mouthfeel
to
back
it
up
o
this
really
isnt
bad
but
man
if
there
isnt
some
really
strange
flavors
to
be
had
in
here
i
really
cant
shake
the
ijustbrushedmyteeth
flavor
after
i
thought
of
it
this
really
tastes
like
i
am
trying
to
drink
an
oatmeal
stout
after
brushing
with
some
toothpaste
some
strange
almost
chemical
dryness
that
only
slightly
suggests
milk
fat
or
sugars
some
nice
carob
and
chocolate
notes
that
mix
well
but
the
carob
wins
out
where
it
might
be
better
for
the
chocolate
to
the
way
the
carob
lingers
accentuates
a
light
hop
note
this
combines
with
some
dryness
makes
for
a
strange
mustardlike
linger
i
dont
know
what
to
say
the
flavors
arent
bad
but
where
it
takes
me
is
questionable
good
but
not
decent
but
missable
easy
to
drink
but
hard
to
buy
cheers
overall
a
delicious
rich
sweet
stout
through
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
but
it
admittedly
gets
a
bit
cloying
toward
the
end
no
problems
whatsoever
in
finishing
the
bottle
though
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
even
if
you
might
have
to
split
it
with
someone
else
o
a
good
stout
especially
when
wanting
some
dark
flavors
in
the
summer
months
but
dont
want
to
deal
with
heavy
mouthfeel
and
taste
so
in
that
regard
this
beer
is
perfect
for
that
so
overall
thats
what
i
enjoyed
the
most
a
couple
of
more
flavors
integrated
in
to
add
some
complexity
would
be
about
my
only
gripe
overall
fantastic
milk
stout
by
3f
yum
overall
while
i
typically
enjoy
milk
stouts
i
especially
enjoy
moloko
the
roasted
malt
and
slight
hop
finish
balance
this
ale
into
a
very
drinkable
milk
stout
o
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
beer
on
tap
but
until
then
i
figure
i
wont
be
seeking
out
this
beer
again
my
quest
for
fantastic
milk
stouts
goes
on
and
leaves
moloko
behind
the
cpj
o
great
example
of
the
style
i
am
so
glad
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
fridge
to
consume
would
love
to
get
this
yearround
if
you
see
it
buy
it
overall
i
will
be
drinking
this
almost
religiously
when
im
in
a
mood
for
a
sweet
stout
or
a
stout
in
general
i
have
a
few
22oz
bombers
that
i
will
be
sampling
in
the
near
future
when
not
drinking
it
fresh
on
tap
great
offering
from

22

this
beer
pours
dark
and
displays
little
head
smells
of
alcohol
lactose
taste
is
sweet
nutty
and
has
some
irishlike
maltiness
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
smooth
and
easy
the
finish
is
clean
for
a
stout
overall
this
beer
is
decent
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
has
a
reddish
tint
while
flowing
from
the
bottle
it
settles
pretty
black
with
an
inch
of
mocha
colored
head
bubbly
lacing
is
spread
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
incredibly
roasty
with
chocolate
and
oats
some
coffee
aromas
linger
as
well
the
taste
is
much
the
same
very
roasty
and
full
of
sweet
milk
chocoalte
coffee
resonates
throughout
very
pleasant
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
stout
but
its
super
drinkable
because
of
it
overall
super
stoked
to
have
tried
this
and
ill
be
grabbing
more
next
time
i
see
it
o
great
after
dinner
drink
leaves
you
wanting
more
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
but
can
definitely
feel
it
i
will
buy
this
i
find
it
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
been
looking
for
it
locally
and
only
recently
came
across
it
nice
example
of
the
style
and
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
o
for
being
from
a
brewery
whose
motto
is
not
normal
moloko
is
rather
normal
other
than
seth
saying
over
and
over
how
good
it
is
i
was
blown
away
with
the
integration
from
the
lactose
to
soften
this
flavorful
stout
this
held
its
own
a
few
other
big
name
beers
we
had
that
day
i
cant
wait
to
see
if
this
makes
it
to

with

the
ginger
seemed
artificial
to
me
this
one
was
at
the
end
of
ebf2015
but
it
still
stood
out
and
i
loved
it
ebf
sample
poured
black
or
something
close
to
it
small

i
remember
that
the
smell
does
have
a
legit
gingerbread
tone
to
it
it
also
smells
chocolatey
holiday
spices
flavor
has
the
conventional
roast
and
chocolate
these
flavors
are
accompanied
by
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
actual
ginger
none
of
these
are
overbearing
flavors
play
well
together
and
it
actually
isnt
as
sweet
as
i
was
initially
expecting
relatively
full
bodied
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
interesting
and
i
surely
doesnt
fall
into
the
category
of
being
hokey
the
flavors
are
natural
it
doesnt
come
off
as
artificial
im
thankful
for
that
this
is
awesome
gingerbread
isnt
overwhelming
but
a
nice
balanced
stout
need
to
see
more
of
these
guys
overall
okay
i
guess
cant
believe
this
one
is
held
so
highly
actually
the
look
is
certainly
wanting
and
the
base
stout
not
surprisingly
seems
to
be
rather
weak
but
the
adjuncts
make
it
interesting
enough
wish
they
had
put
a
little
more
effort
into
a
solid
stout
base
before
they
went
around
throwing
stuff
in
it
we
moved
on
to
the
bourbon
barrel
version
afterwards
and
to
be
honest
that
one
wasnt
much
more
impressive
either
perhaps
a
touch
of
oak
but
it
was
much
the
same
a
disappointing
set
unfortunately
still
these
things
are
always
fun
to
try
so
cheers

the
brews

for

the
beer
hits
up

milk

but
then
gets
dominated
heavily
by
cinnamon
and
that
ginger
cookie
flavor
but
quite
intense
the
flavor

it

the

that
would
be
delicious
as
is
it
is
very
yummy
and
highlights

much
stout
maybe
i
just
dont
get
it

was

i
felt
the
gingerbread
was
way
too
overwhelming
this
beer
surprised
me

are

very

flavor
in

it
hits
the
spot
definitely
worth
getting
your

on
a
big
bottle
when
you
can
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
really
its
not
bad
but
the
taste
to
me
was
just
not
great
as
far
a
dessert
beers
this
one
is
not
for
me
if
you
love
gingerbread
it
would
likely
be
good
quality
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
if
it
was
in
my
distro
lives
up
to
the
hype
must
like
ginger
taste
overall
this
is
among
my
favorite
milk
stouts
and
a
great
holiday
beer
this
beer
had
a
pronounced
ginger
and
cinnamon
smell
it
tasted
like
ginger
and
hot
cinnamon
and
alcohol
i
did
not
taste
any
stout
flavor
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
as
i
am
underwhelmed
by
all
these
newbies
who
love
koolaid
beer
you
used
to
have
to
acquire
the
taste
for
beer
but
now
many
brewers
cater
to
the
narrow
pallets
of
children
smooth
mouth
feel
hints
of
chocolate
and
spicy
ginger
drink
warm
for
full
flavor
reviewed
after
aged
for
1
year
i
dont
quite
get
this
one
but
apparently
im
in
the
minority
based
on
other
reviews
fresh
ginger
is
definitely
present
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
but
its
quite
lacking
in
gingerbread
cookie
and
milk
stout
flavors
like
i
was
hoping
for
instead
it
tastes
and
smells
more
like
somebody
mixed
a
light
stout
with
cocacola
and
a
jamaican
ginger
beer
soda
its
also
quite
thin
with
more
carbonation
than
it
should
have
i
was
hoping
for
a
thicker
body
with
more
robust
and
cookielike
stout
flavors
so
this
is
very
disappointing
i
love
this
beer
its
the
tittaes
my
girlfriend
wow
was
this
one
a
great
trade
item
pours
beautifully
with
a
thick
dark
caramel
head
lots
of
roastiness
to
this
one
along
with
small
hints
of
gingerbread
while
the
taste
is
not
a
huge
gingerbread
hit
i
enjoyed
that
as
i
was
scared
it
would
be
too
strong
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
this
one
was
treat
now
to
find
the
variants
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
the
only
thing
that
doesnt
give
it
a
better
score
is
that
its
a
bit
thin
seeking
more
of
this
out
very
satisfying
well
integrated
additives
one
of
the
best
gingerbread
beers
i
ever
had
try
going
7030
mix
on
this
with
bourbon
county
stout
awesomeness
this
beer
is
amazing
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
so
hard
to
get
also
if
i
could
rate
the
smell
above
a
5
i
would
i
literally
keep
smelling
the
empty
glass
after
its
gone
amazing
ginger
again
is
prominent
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
cinnamon
gets
a
little
sticky
in
the
lips
super
smooth
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
feels
magnificent
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
and
tastes
just
as
advertised
gotta
love
that
get
it
the
first
few
years
of
this
beer
were
worth
the
wait
2014
was
a
disappointment
and
not
worth
the
hype
overall
this
is
the
perfect
beer
i
can
find
very
few
flaws
but
event
those
arent
worth
mentioning
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
stouts
ever
produced
the
the
way
the
ingredients
work
together
to
create
a
wonderful
and
complex
yet
simple
taste
and
smell
is
amazing
you
really
have
to
buy
this
beer
to
understand
just
how
good
it
is
o
this
beer
is
special
and
certainly
deserves
the
high
rating
stouts
are
my
favorite
style
and
this
beer
really
brings
something
new
to
the
table
i
need
to
get
another
bottle
or
maybe
a
case
xmas
in
your
mouth
better
at
almost
room
temp
this
reminds
me
of
a
smooth
imperial
stout
that
has
a
smooth
creamy
draw
that
leaves
a
satisfying
stick
to
your
lips
to
tease
you
for
another
drink
drier
than
i
expected
with
some
heavy
handed
spicing
however
it
still
remains
very
decadent
and
rich
hides
the
9
2
well
i
wanted
to
like
it
much
better
than
i
actually
did
oh
well
overall
this
certainly
is
a
holiday
beer
lots
of
good
strong
flavors
very
reminiscent
of
a
ginger
bread
cookie
but
not
the
type
of
beer
i
will
go
crazy
for
definitely
a
cool
experience
or
o
outstanding
is
too
loose
a
word
an
almost
perfect
beer
masterpiece
i
would
only
ask
for
a
more
heavier
mouth
feel
perfect
for
cold
nights
and
a
warm
fire
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
you
had
better
like
ginger
and
spiced
beer
in
general
if
you
want
to
try
this
beer
this
is
a
very
fresh
bottle
maybe
sitting
on
this
for
awhile
would
have
helped
but
not
up
my
alley
delicious
seasonal
beer
cinnamon
and
ginger
spices
with
amazing
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
a
dessert
beer
in
the
sense
that
its
worth
having
alone
or
only
paired
with
dessert
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
some
sweet
beer
knockoff
that
isnt
a
great
beer
on
its
merits
this
was
a
perfect
beer
tasted
a
bit
more
like
dark
coffee
beer
but
the
ginger
flavor
comes
in
as
an
aftertaste
the
flavor
really
grows
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoy
in
small
doses
its
a
dessert
beer
for
me
due
to
the
aggressiveness
of
the
ginger
and
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
wouldnt
quite
describe
it
as
cloying
but
its
close
now
i
need
to
try
the
ba
version
definitely
a
decent
beer
and
a
fairly
unique
one
to
my
experiences
im
not
sure
it
resonates
with
me
but
i
can
appreciate
why
others
like
it
wont
avoid
it
in
the
future
for
sure
nice
gingerbread
flavor
this
is
a
real
dangerous
and
addictive
brew
i
can
see
why
people
can
easily
get
into
it
its
also
wonderfully
conceived
and
brilliantly
executed
that
really
hits
on
the
food
character
so
perfectly
no
wonder
its
rated
it
so
highly
great
stuff
what
more
needs
to
be
said
pretty
good
very
delicious
all
the
flavors
are
there
relatively
balanced
and
never
cloying
comparable
to
xocoveza
with
the
big
cinnamonvanilla
flavors
it
makes
me
really
want
to
try
the
bbl
version
definitely
a
great
christmasy
treat
recommended
look
im
a
hometowner
and
long
time
fan
of
hardywood
but
i
just
dont
see
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
on
this
one
its
interesting
but
just
too
sweet
and
gingery
its
fine
but
it
just
didnt
keep
me
interested
like
for
example
xocoveza
just
had
the
gingerbread
stout
for
the
first
time
two
words
awesome
awesome
like
a
liquid
cookie
in
my
mouth
everyone
absolutely
loves
this
stuff
whereas
i
merely
like
it
a
lot
its
nearly
impossible
to
get
your
hands
on
because
its
so
popular
but
it
is
absolutely
worth
a
try
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
their
first
year
was
the
best
second
year
it
went
down
a
little
bit
probably
due
to
increased
brewing
capacity
third
year
it
is
back
on
top
simply
delicious
creamy
lots
of
ginger
bread
flavor
overall
the
spices
elevate
this
beyond
the
what
the
base
stout
seems
to
deliver
side
note
a
growler
of
this
beer
was
given
to
me
around
christmas
and
so
its
been
about
three
months
since
then
the
carbonation
help
up
very
well
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
overall
really
nice
holiday
beer
its
not
overly
sweet
and
balanced
really
well
each
element
stands
out
but
mixes
in
with
eachother
well
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
and
has
more
vanilla
then
i
figured
this
should
be
a
staple
holiday
ale
for
anyone
that
can
get
it
full
body
o
i
can
really
understand
the
hype
behind
this
beer
especially
coming
out
of
va
a
state
thats
just
getting
started
in
the
craft
brew
world
o
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sweeter
stouts
will
be
looking
forward
to
this
beer
next
year
i
ended
up
pouring
out
my
pour
after
a
while
i
just
couldnt
finish
drinking
my
pour
due
to
the
strength
of
the
ginger
overpowering
the
rest
of
the
components
of
the
beer
good
idea
terrible
execution
not
recommended
on
my
part
apparently
i
dont
like
strong
ginger
flavours
serving
type
bottle
not
bad
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
intense
that
being
said
a
very
unique
beer
with
great
flavors
overall
oa
wonderful
beer
grateful
that
i
was
able
to
try
it
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
fresh
i
will
seek
to
consume
this
on
every
christmas
from
here
on
out
o
decent
gingerbread
stout
that
had
a
bit
too
much
astringency
from
the
dark
chocolate
that
overpowers
the
gingerbread
aspect
also
i
found
it
to
taste
slightly
artificial
seek
it
out
drink
swoon
and
thank
him
and
the
great
folks
at
hardywood
overall
great
brew
a
nice
mix
of
holiday
spice
winter
warmer
types
and
a
tasty
creamy
milk
stout
spice
is
spice
but
this
is
nice
o
gingerbread
in
full
force
nicely
done
very
good
o
i
only
recommend
this
one
if
you
are
truly
in
love
with
ginger
luckily
i
am
so
this
beer
is
amazing
this
one
is
perfect
went
to
the
tasting
room
for
this
highly
reviewed
beer
since
when
did
richmond
become
the
craft
beer
mecca
pours
to
a
nice
2
finger
head
dark
mahogany
color
nice
head
retention
aroma
is
to
die
for
gingerbread
nutmeg
chocolate
vanilla
and
sweet
caramelized
sugars
drink
in
the
aroma
hits
the
lips
with
a
very
smooth
and
clean
entrance
taste
gingerbread
vanilla
nutmeg
and
chocolate
instantly
others
have
said
it
but
it
is
true
christmas
in
a
glassbottle
i
have
had
both
now
but
on
tap
is
a
upgrade
if
you
can
believe
that
goes
down
smooth
with
a
nice
after
taste
of
gingerbread
nutmeg
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
ive
bought
a
case
of
750ml
bottles
since
trying
this
beer
im
hooked
however
it
does
not
age
all
that
well
so
drink
it
while
it
is
fresh
i
cracked
open
a
properly
stored
750ml
bottle
that
was
a
year
old
and
while
good
it
definitely
loses
some
of
the
spices
kegs
really
dont
age
well
had
a
draft
from
a
newly
tapped
year
old
keg
and
it
was
quite
bland
compared
to
a
fresh
draft
i
hoarded
bottles
to
trade
however
ill
need
to
trade
them
within
45
months
or
they
person
acquiring
them
will
be
disappointed
still
really
good
even
a
year
later
but
just
not
blow
you
away
good
the
lactose
sugars
and
rich
chocolatey
coffee
malt
characteristics
provide
an
incredibly
smooth
velvety
base
for
the
vanilla
toffee
and
molasseslike
honey
that
springs
forward
then
that
ginger
punch
at
the
end
that
just
lingers
around
after
the
silky
finish
just
makes
it
perfect
this
is
the
first
overall
5
ive
given
and
i
did
it
without
thinking
twice
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
swing
through
richmond
during
the
winter
of
see
the
opportunity
to
get
this
in
a
trade
dont
you
dare
pass
it
up
as
an
aside
i
would
be
interested
in
what
hardywood
could
do
with
the
base
of
this
beer
that
is
what
does
their
straightforward
milk
stout
taste
like
it
seems
like
it
is
structured
around
a
very
solid
milk
stout
formula
and
that
could
be
interesting
for
a
yearround
offering
i
really
appreciate
big
beers
or
experimental
beers
that
underneath
remain
relatively
true
to
style
i
feel
as
though
gbs
has
that
quality
to
it
overall
this
is
probably
better
fresh
but
is
still
a
very
solid
spiced
stout
which
is
enjoyable
by
the
fire
on
a
nice
cold
night
overall
this
was
a
very
good
stout
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
picked
this
up
from
a
great
trade
with
mike
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
a
beautiful
caramelcolored
two
finger
head
with
super
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
nutty
and
roasty
with
nice
ginger
and
cinnamon
notes
along
with
hints
of
coffee
mocha
and
some
subtle
nutmeg
and
clove
the
taste
is
roasty
nutty
and
spicy
with
loads
of
cinnamon
ginger
bread
and
coffee
along
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
tobacco
cocoa
vanilla
and
some
subtle
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bitter
finish
overall
this
really
exceeded
my
expectations
i
figured
it
would
be
sickly
sweet
but
it
was
beautifully
balanced
complex
and
flavorful
my
first
hardywood
beer
but
definitely
not
my
last
awesome
beer
poured
from
a
750
into
a
pint
glass
comes
out
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
you
can
smell
the
gingerbread
flavor
right
away
goes
down
smooth
get
notes
of
chocolate
ginger
on
the
way
down
great
winter
beer
in
the
cold
taste
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
highly
recommended
thanks
to
kwaide
for
this
trade
yes
that
rhymed
a
good
beer
but
a
little
dull
i
expected
more
othis
was
a
delicious
stout
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
allowed
this
beer
to
have
a
nice
complexity
and
balance
o
this
tastes
pretty
nice
and
compares
favorably
to
other
gingerbread
stouts
ive
had
due
to
a
bit
of
restraint
in
the
spice
department
its
overcarbonated
though
so
the
mouthfeel
suffers
huge
thanks
goes
to
miikezombie
for
sending
this
my
way
apparently
this
ones
quite
highly
rated
here
by
both
users
and
the
bros
so
im
looking
forward
to
it
despite
the
recommendation
of
a
pint
glass
im
pouring
this
9
2
abv
stout
into
a
snifter
from
cigar
city
dark
brownblack
in
color
with
a
thick
mousselike
light
tan
head
ginger
comes
up
quickly
in
the
aromas
with
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
theres
a
picture
of
a
gingerbread
cookie
on
the
label
and
they
certainly
nailed
the
aroma
more
of
this
cookielike
quality
comes
through
in
the
flavor
with
cinnamon
taking
a
bigger
leap
forward
still
lots
of
ginger
milk
chocolatey
certainly
hop
flavor
was
an
afterthought
here
though
theres
enough
bitterness
to
keep
things
from
going
offtrack
silky
velvety
texture
with
sufficient
carbonation
while
it
may
be
5
months
past
christmas
this
is
still
tasting
fantastic
certainly
one
id
like
to
revisit
again
down
the
road
perhaps
in
the
appropriate
time
of
year
and
a
tad
closer
to
bottling
the
people
i
was
with
didnt
love
gingerbread
cookies
like
i
did
so
they
werent
as
crazy
about
this
beer
as
i
was
i
love
gingerbread
cookies
and
i
thought
this
was
damn
good
a
little
more
complexity
or
development
wouldnt
hurt
but
they
were
going
for
a
gingerbread
cookie
beer
and
thats
pretty
much
what
they
got
sweet
without
being
cloyingly
so
very
solid
stout
for
those
that
love
the
little
cookiemen
o
a
very
unusual
and
flavorful
combination
highly
recommended
d
this
thing
certainly
has
plenty
of
elements
of
gingerbread
however
a
few
are
missing
nutmeg
for
sure
and
cant
say
im
getting
too
much
clove
either
thats
me
being
picky
otherwise
a
very
tasty
very
unique
stout
from
gingerbread
i
recommend
drinking
it
around
the
holidays
im
surprised
the
additions
of
ginger
and
honey
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
this
just
seemed
too
gimmicky
and
really
disappointing
worst
christmas
ever
overall
well
this
is
my
first
gingerbread
stout
but
i
say
its
spot
on
with
what
you
would
expect
the
only
thing
is
maybe
it
could
use
more
of
a
presence
of
gingerbread
and
cinnamon
and
other
seasonal
spices
an
awesome
beer
cheers
very
good
thanks
colin
d
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
in
mass
quantities
but
achieves
exactly
what
it
sets
out
to
do
enjoyable
for
a
few
ounces
albeit
a
tad
undersized
for
the
listed
abv
curious
how
the
bourbon
barrel
version
compares
although
id
be
concerned
the
body
didnt
stand
up
o
a
really
nice
beer
definitely
unique
and
something
that
those
who
loved
a
christmas
ale
but
got
burnt
out
should
try
bottle
shared
with
a
few
friends
poured
into
a
snifter
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
color
with
a
short
tan
head
while
the
taste
of
it
is
brown
sugar
cinnamon
cocoa
roasted
malts
amongst
some
other
spicesflavors
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
it
seems
like
a
lot
but
is
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
towards
heavy
a
creamy
finish
it
leaves
you
with
a
sweetness
on
your
palate
going
into
this
beer
from
hardywood
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
but
for
what
it
is
they
really
did
a
nice
job
a
perfect
beer
to
serve
alongside
most
desserts
overall
a
fantastic
brew
that
tastes
like
what
it
was
intended
to
taste
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
stout
after
drinking
this
brew
the
boston
beer
co
should
be
ashamed
of
their
horrid
tasting
gingerbread
christmas
stout
this
brew
would
be
allworld
if
the
carbonation
was
turned
down
a
bit
which
was
too
high
for
my
liking
the
high
carbonation
keeps
the
beer
from
getting
heavy
and
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
makes
it
too
pillowy
in
the
mouth
for
the
rich
flavors
to
grab
hold
and
be
enjoyed
to
their
fullest
anyway
i
am
glad
i
have
2
more
bottles
of
this
brew
in
transit
to
me
as
we
speak
as
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
the
beer
works
because
it
is
a
stout
first
knowing
that
the
dryness
will
expose
flaws
in
taste
and
throw
off
the
balance
it
is
propped
up
with
an
enormously
creamy
texture
and
taste
proving
to
this
skeptic
that
stout
and
gingerbread
can
indeed
play
nicely
with
one
another
surprising
how
much
this
tastes
like
a
ginger
bread
cookie
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
with
strong
ginger
and
english
biscuit
flavor
tastes
just
like
the
cookie
with
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
ginger
snap
followed
by
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
oatmeal
and
subtle
roast
nicely
balanced
with
a
well
masked
abv
making
it
easy
to
drink
sweet
but
not
boozy
or
cloying
great
gingerbread
cookie
flavor
but
still
tastes
like
a
stout
very
good
label
says
gingerbread
stout
and
it
delivers
aroma
and
flavors
are
spoton
tastes
like
freagin
christmas
in
a
bottle
actually
with
layer
upon
layer
building
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
hell
they
even
nailed
the
damn
sugary
frosting
on
the
gingerbread
man
run
run
as
fast
as
you
can
we
want
more
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
wish
i
would
have
received
two
bottles
though
so
i
could
have
put
one
away
to
cellar
it
reminded
me
of
christmas
as
a
kid
when
i
would
eat
ginger
bread
men
instead
of
putting
them
on
the
tree
i
would
also
love
to
see
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
cost
12
for
a
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
flat
raisin
colored
body
with
no
head
no
lace
damn
near
flat
looking
sweet
honey
ginger
and
spices
on
the
nose
ginger
dominates
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
more
caramel
sweetness
than
suggested
ginger
again
dominates
alongside
chocolate
caramel
gingerbreadlike
spices
and
a
bit
of
honey
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
very
low
and
tight
carbonation
this
basically
tasted
like
gingerbread
with
chocolate
and
honey
very
delicious
and
unique
overall
while
this
was
a
nice
beer
it
is
not
a
100
its
a
solid
example
of
a
spiced
stout
but
it
lacks
a
little
balance
and
this
comes
from
someone
that
loves
spice
pumpkin
and
holiday
beers
i
think
the
hype
train
may
have
gotten
a
little
off
the
tracks
on
this
one
which
is
why
i
ignore
those
review
numbers
on
the
top
of
the
page
and
so
should
you
o
this
beer
is
excellent
i
am
now
on
the
lookout
for
the
barrel
aged
version
o
obviously
not
a
traditional
milk
stout
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
and
really
well
executed
gingerbread
beer
o
unreal
just
super
delicious
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
i
will
probably
cellar
down
as
contrary
to
what
jlindros
said
allegedly
the
inaugural
batch
is
drinking
outstanding
even
better
than
fresh
a
year
later
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
cocoa
and
lots
of
gingerbread
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
gingerbread
cookie
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
smells
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
big
thanks
goes
out
to
sincerenc
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
past
random
sunday
tasting
2011
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
pitch
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
ginger
cookie
sugar
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
gingerbread
ginger
sugar
and
spice
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
brewery
really
nailed
the
gingerbread
cookie
aspect
here
if
i
am
honest
it
almost
tasted
like
you
were
drinking
a
gingerbread
man
in
all
his
glory
very
well
balanced
and
complex
this
made
it
quite
inviting
and
would
make
it
a
perfect
candidate
for
a
dessert
beer
very
well
done
and
i
hope
i
get
to
try
more
of
it
in
the
future
overall
a
great
beer
so
much
gingerbread
cookie
its
ridiculous
a
great
amazing
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
cases
in
the
cellar
and
i
might
try
to
find
some
except
that
i
dont
think
this
will
hold
up
thanks
again
matt
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
a
thin
ring
of
retention
this
had
a
very
thing
lacing
the
smell
is
spicy
with
sweet
vanilla
and
wood
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
excellent
the
spice
is
perfect
is
subtly
roasted
and
had
a
fantastic
sweetness
to
balance
out
everything
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
nice
carbonation
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
very
good
stuff
fantastic
beer
id
like
more
and
am
definitely
interested
in
the
barrelaged
version
now
o
coming
into
this
i
really
didnt
think
this
would
like
up
to
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
happily
it
lived
up
and
even
exceeded
my
expectations
this
beer
is
a
winner
all
around
from
the
handsome
labelling
and
the
cc
presentation
to
the
most
importantly
liquid
inside
the
bottle
this
is
a
winner
definitely
not
something
id
want
every
day
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
been
fortunate
to
sample
in
quite
a
while
i
can
only
imagine
what
the
ba
version
of
this
must
be
like
o
this
was
a
very
good
gingerbread
christmas
themed
sweet
stout
that
i
definitely
hope
to
have
again
it
is
very
well
executed
with
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
ginger
honey
and
cocoa
the
only
aspect
that
could
definitely
be
improved
a
little
bit
is
the
aroma
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
had
this
right
after
an

well
ive
heard
both
positive
and
negative
opinions
as
to
how
gbs
might
age
after
one
year
and
have
now
finally
found
out
for
myself
as
expected
the
ginger
spice
did
not
win
the
battle
against
father
time
what
i
didnt
expect
but
still
rather
enjoyed
was
this
beers
transformation
into
what
i
think
most
resembles
a
malty
barleywine
the
emergence
of
caramelized
sugars
molasses
tobacco
and
dark
fruits
is
pretty
fascinating
having
said
all
of
this
i
think
gbs
is
without
a
doubt
best
consumed
on
the
fresher
side
though
id
still
recommend
trying
it
with
some
age
if
seeking
out
a
different
experience
dont
go
into
this
expecting
a
heavy
bold
stout
it
is
quite
a
bit
thinner
and
more
subdued
o
this
will
forever
be
my
favorite
christmas
beer
i
will
be
attending
the
release
every
single
year
from
now
on
dont
pass
on
this
one
folks
it
is
a
delicious
and
unique
stout
my
wife
got
sick
on
christmas
eve
night
so
i
drank
the
entire
750ml
bottle
by
myself
loved
every
minute
of
it
this
is
as
authentic
with
gingerbread
as
southern
tier
gets
with
their
blackwater
flavors
start
to
finish
this
is
an
excellent
holiday
gingerbready
treat
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
bourbon
version
overall
this
is
a
nice
desert
beer
its
not
as
spice
forward
as
i
expected
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
was
impressed
i
went
to
richmond
with
the
hopes
of
getting
to
try
this
and
a
bunch
of
other
hardywood
beers
and
i
was
not
disappointed
one
of
the
best
tasting
christmasspiced
beers
ive
ever
had
0
awesome
beer
maybe
the
best
beer
for
beer
lovers
and
novices
to
drink
together
the
taste
is
so
good
anyone
can
approach
it
and
any
beer
geek
can
taste
the
genius
that
goes
into
every
glass
i
have
a
case
of
the
2012
ready
to
be
aged
and
2
bottles
of
the
ba
version
cant
wait
to
see
how
they
taste
with
a
bit
of
father
time
on
them
o
this
was
a
really
great
milk
stout
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
did
impress
me
for
the
style
but
overall
i
dont
think
id
go
for
another
bottle
kudos
to
you
hardywood
for
making
a
well
thought
out
and
well
execute
release
overall
i
thought
t
was
a
great
beer
and
i
especially
loved
the
uniqueness
of
it
i
thought
everything
came
together
almost
perfectly
in
it
they
managed
to
completely
capture
a
gingerbread
cookie
in
a
glass
without
overdoing
it
on
the
sweetness
or
spices
im
not
usually
big
on
spiced
beers
but
this
one
is
easily
the
best
holiday
spiced
beer
ive
had
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
around
the
holidays
poured
from
bomber
into
tulip
glass
pours
blackbrown
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
had
some
staying
power
aroma
is
baked
gingerbread
some
chocolate
slight
roast
flavor
was
spot
on
gingerbread
cookie
ginger
spice
bread
crust
chocolate
roasted
coffee
thick
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
throughout
this
beer
is
an
eptiome
of
what
a
christmas
beer
should
taste
like
overall
absolutely
delicious
way
too
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
like
a
dessert
very
good
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
holiday
spiced
ale
ive
had
but
really
the
mouthfeel
prevents
it
from
being
world
class
i
like
a
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
in
my
stouts
the
sweet
spot
where
the
carbonation
had
died
a
bit
but
not
warm
enough
for
the
spices
to
take
over
was
too
brief
looking
forward
to
trying
the
ba
version
of
this
on
draft
multiple
times
in
richmond
the
2012
version
is
a
bit
lighter
bodied
that
the
2011
version
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
the
2011
counterpart
i
couldnt
finish
a
12oz
pour
of
the
2011
but
the
2012
is
a
very
sessionable
9
6
stout
the
taste
is
very
unique
and
very
spicy
on
draft
not
a
big
appearance
person
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
divine
had
this
on
draft
at
mekong
in
richmond
va
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
almost
black
with
a
deep
brown
head
smells
of
vanilla
and
gingerbread
very
sweet
although
sweet
it
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
great
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
and
just
a
great
beer
overall
very
smooth
just
enough
carbonation
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
refrigerated
for
about
510
minutes
before
serving
poured
into
a
hardywood
goblet
a
dark
brown
color
lighter
around
the
edges
with
about
two
fingers
of
beige
head
that
dwindled
to
a
thick
ringlet
this
was
very
strange
at
first
the
aroma
was
very
acrid
and
it
seemed
oxidized
to
me
with
a
bit
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
caramel
coming
through
after
letting
it
sit
for
a
while
this
changed
quite
dramatically
becoming
more
full
of
gingerbread
cookie
vanilla
icing
and
all
the
harshness
almost
completely
removed
the
taste
was
extremely
bitter
up
front
extremely
bitter
there
was
a
definite
gingerbread
cookie
sensation
in
there
but
the
bitterness
overwhelmed
it
completely
and
again
there
seemed
to
be
offflavors
indicative
of
oxidation
so
i
let
it
sit
some
more
the
cookieness
came
out
a
bit
more
but
it
was
still
quite
bitter
and
stale
woody
and
kind
of
unpleasant
all
the
way
into
the
aftertaste
its
almost
as
if
a
good
yummy
cookie
flavor
wants
to
come
to
the
forefront
but
it
just
never
gets
there
body
was
about
medium
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
more
like
an
english
stout
or
even
a
brown
ale
fairly
smooth
but
just
too
harsh
in
flavor
to
be
enjoyable
i
cant
imagine
these
bottles
being
bad
already
the
alternative
theory
is
this
is
just
another
overhyped
beer
not
impressed
pours
a
ruby
tinged
cola
brown
with
a
light
camel
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
collar
with
no
lace
and
minimal
retention
smells
like
a
container
of
mccormicks
cinnamon
and
light
vanilla
powdery
indeterminate
spice
mild
vanilla
nutmeg
mild
and
balanced
but
artificial
medium
light
soft
carbonation
and
a
powdery
finish
thin
throughout
flavor
is
a
little
sweeter
up
front
honey
and
chocolate
with
an
all
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
finish
balanced
and
not
cloying
but
i
dont
get
it
if
i
want
a
stout
ill
drink
one
this
tastes
nothing
like
one
watery
gingerbread
and
cinnamon
in
a
glass
not
for
me
watery
maroonish
black
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
unreal
like
gingerbread
men
tastes
the
same
gingerbread
happiness
very
festive
like
a
cookie
light
bodied
wild
and
different
extremely
unique
and
mad
tasty
a
little
much
to
probably
take
on
a
bottle
to
yourself
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
blow
your
family
away
with
this
holiday
season
this
is
it
o
i
was
wondering
if
this
was
going
to
be
hype
but
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
and
perfect
beer
for
what
they
were
looking
to
do
i
am
immediately
going
out
to
look
for
more
in
trade
it
was
that
good
overall
hardywood
nailed
this
beer
its
amazing
perfect
integration
of
gingerbread
flavors
into
a
stout
this
is
the
best
christmas
beer
that
i
have
ever
drank
o
overall
a
very
good
stout
and
my
favorite
milk
stout
to
date
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
going
in
here
to
make
it
more
complex
while
at
the
same
time
helping
to
mask
any
flaws
but
as
a
full
package
i
dig
it
o
a
superb
holiday
beer
would
recommend
to
anyone
even
to
nonbeer
drinkers
overall
this
beer
delivered
a
really
unique
experience
id
love
to
know
the
recipe
of
this
one
to
see
how
they
pulled
it
all
off
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
really
easy
beer
to
screw
up
but
they
have
brought
it
all
together
to
make
a
great
holiday
beer
cant
wait
to
crack
one
of
these
again
on
christmas
eve
the
beer
sports
a
black
body
with
a
half
inch
of
beige
cap
the
aroma
is
awesome
gingerbread
cookies
roast
cookie
dough
brown
sugar
cinnamon
the
taste
follows
suit
with
additional
notes
of
chocolate
and
chocolate
milk
no
lactic
sourness
whatsoever
super
smooth
and
creamy
with
everything
coming
together
beautifully
a
work
of
art
sweet
but
never
cloying
an
ideal
beer
to
enjoy
over
the
holidays
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
i
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
from
hoppedup
for
those
who
remember
him
from
this
site
and
decided
to
drive
to
richmond
for
the
release
glad
i
did
as
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
nicely
differentiated
from
a
lot
of
the
other
big
stouts
that
get
released
around
these
parts
ive
had
this
straight
from
the
tap
out
of
a
growler
and
out
of
their
massive
corked
bottles
i
prefer
it
on
tap
or
from
the
growler
the
bottles
seem
to
have
an
excess
of
carbonation
which
makes
pouring
an
drinking
immediately
less
pleasant
fortunately
i
can
take
my
growlers
direct
to
the
source
beer
pours
a
dark
brownalmost
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
there
are
a
ton
of
bubbles
making
it
actually
look
almost
like
a
glass
of
coke
smell
is
of
winter
baking
spices
primarily
with
some
roasted
malt
in
the
background
i
dont
think
i
would
think
gingerbread
based
on
the
smell
if
this
beer
wasnt
called
what
it
is
that
said
it
smells
quite
nice
flavor
takes
it
to
the
next
level
however
as
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
chocolatey
gingerbread
cookie
the
same
winter
spices
from
the
nose
combine
very
nicely
with
the
stout
base
to
create
something
very
tasty
and
welldone
its
sweet
but
far
from
being
overly
so
and
still
maintains
the
roasty
stout
aspects
of
the
beer
without
letting
the
spices
take
over
very
nicely
balanced
i
get
much
more
gingerbread
in
the
flavor
though
i
still
wonder
if
i
wouldve
come
to
that
conclusion
on
my
own
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
works
well
for
the
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
every
day
but
its
pretty
damn
impressive
for
what
it
is
a
great
wellcrafted
unique
beer
for
the
holidays
o
too
bad
about
the
mouthfeel
otherwise
this
would
get
a
5
0
regardless
this
beer
is
freakin
spectacular
a
real
achievement
and
a
totally
unique
idea
that
hardywood
pulls
off
with
aplomb
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
them
and
i
cant
wait
for
the
bourbon
treatment
that
is
rumored
to
be
making
an
appearance
in
the
fall
its
not
one
i
can
say
i
would
want
a
bottle
of
alone
so
those
of
you
who
are
wondering
whether
they
should
share
this
delicacy
i
would
recommend
you
absolutely
open
this
with
a
friend
as
drinking
this
by
itself
would
put
you
into
a
coma
that
said
it
is
a
great
achievement
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
the
hype
is
for
real
on
this
one
folks
o
its
a
great
beer
no
doubt
not
an
in
your
face
specialty
beer
a
well
put
together
beer
with
a
mix
of
great
flavors
that
do
not
overpower
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
the
bottlea
few
times
each
way
fantastic
off
the
top
of
my
head
theres
no
beer
that
absolutely
nails
a
recreation
of
dessert
or
any
type
of
food
the
way
this
does
as
hopbully
stated
you
can
keep
drinking
this
beer
and
will
probably
want
to
whereas
with
other
dessert
type
beers
i
feel
like
ive
had
all
i
need
after
12
a
pint
nice
job
with
the
booming
gingerbread
cookie
flavors
without
being
overpowering
well
done
hardywood
o
whats
there
not
to
like
its
gingerbread
in
a
glass
through
and
through
brilliant
great
dessert
beer
that
you
can
actually
drink
more
than
one
very
black
pour
great
nose
lots
of
cinnamon
and
chocolate
and
spices
you
get
that
ginger
like
you
are
about
to
bite
into
a
ginger
snap
or
gingerbread
cookie
the
finish
is
like
you
just
ate
a
gingerbread
cookie
incredible
recreation
of
a
snack
unique
and
one
of
a
kind
looking
forward
to
next
bottling
and
some
wild
variations
o
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
it
tastes
and
smells
like
chocolatecovered
gingerbread
cookies
great
beer
from
a
new
brewery
o
as
mentioned
before
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
wish
this
one
wasnt
just
a
seasonal
and
with
the
rate
at
which
it
sold
im
sure
im
not
alone
on
that
front
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
treading
a
fine
line
between
imperial
stout
and
holiday
beer
its
a
nice
enough
stout
that
i
would
drink
it
normally
but
spiced
enough
to
celebrate
the
season
will
be
very
curious
as
to
how
this
agesmellows
o
oh
hardywood
how
i
love
you
this
new
hardywood
reserve
series
is
absolutely
amazing
im
just
sad
itll
only
be
around
for
the
holidays
the
gingerbread
and
honey
flavor
is
fantastic
and
its
perfectly
complimented
by
all
of
its
other
parts
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
that
everyone
should
try
4
5
overall
this
is
a
money
stout
guys
seek
it
out
and
get
it
excellent
beer
from
this
new
brewery
had
it
at
the
brewery
at
their
illumination
party
they
also
had
some
small
batch
brews
all
stouts
flavored
with
various
different
ingredients
as
those
will
probably
not
go
into
production
ill
just
review
this
one
its
an
imperial
stout
9
5
or
around
that
sweet
although
well
balanced
you
dont
really
taste
the
high
alcohol
level
lots
of
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
ginger
never
had
a
stout
with
ginger
in
it
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
these
guys
look
to
be
taking
over
the
virginia
market
as
the
best
brewery
looking
forward
to
more
from
these
guys
overall
a
fantastic
variant
on
the
gbs
even
though
the
new
notes
are
frequently
buried
overall
like
the
base
beer
this
is
no
better
than
okay
the
adjunct
character
is
interesting
enough
but
the
base
stout
is
rather
weak
and
the
barrel
aging
is
pretty
mundane
still
these
pairs
are
always
fun
to
try
and
id
say
this
one
was
slightly
more
interesting
than
the
base
beer
so
thats
something
at
least
cheers
again
for
the
brews
siddfinch
wow
though
it
tastes
great
soft
chocolate
hints
of
dead
yeast
also
a
bit
of
booze
i
love
this
beer
not
much
from
hardywood
that
doesnt
make
you
say
wow
a
perfect
winter
stout
slight
hints
of
bourbon
and
a
gingerbread
finish
it
drinks
incredibly
smooth
and
viscous
this
seemed
to
lose
a
bit
of
luster
from
the
base
beer
which
is
unusual
for
anything
in
a
barrel
but
maybe
i
love
the
original
too
much
fell
short
for
me
in
the
taste
category
wished
there
would
have
been
more
of
a
bourbon
presence
vs
an
undertone
wow
spectacular
from
start
to
finish
no
bitterness
but
a
great
deal
of
flavor
i
gave
the
regular
gbs
a
5
and
this
is
just
a
little
better
with
a
little
more
of
an
alcohol
kick
but
this
is
not
an
over
the
top
bourbon
barrel
beer
still
very
drinkable
and
not
hot
at
all
ready
to
drink
now
no
aging
required
like
hunahpu
a
lot
surprisingly
very
spicy
from
the
cinnamon
had
on
tap
at
ccb
milkmaid
release
i
had
the
regular
gbs
and
the
got
this
on
tap
pour
is
deep
brown
not
quite
black
and
gingerbread
spice
is
still
present
in
the
nose
the
main
thing
to
point
out
here
is
that
the
bourbon
is
not
overwhelming
or
present
up
front
its
just
slight
on
the
back
end
for
most
people
drinking
bourbon
ba
stouts
i
could
see
this
being
underwhelming
but
as
person
that
doesnt
love
bourbon
i
thought
this
was
great
the
ba
added
a
nice
compliment
and
didnt
go
to
far
not
a
100
but
something
id
iso
in
the
wintertime
flavor
is
far
more
melded
the
bourbon
counters
the
ginger
nicely
this
is
christmas
in
a
bottle
its
more
mellow
than
its
regular
cousin
i
like
it
a
lot
more
and
the
fact
that
the
bourbon
become
a
flavor
not
the
dominate
force
is
its
strongest
attribute
very
impressive
quite
similar
to
the
unbarrel
aged
version
but
the
barrel
process
just
adds
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
rich
complex
and
subtle
barrel
character
that
is
not
overwhelming
all
the
xmas
notes
of
the
regular
with
maybe
a
touch
of
mint
coming
through
big
thanks
alexhw
for
this
trade
one
of
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
ginger
is
amazing
d
this
was
a
nice
brew
with
relatively
simple
but
really
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
weak
but
the
finish
was
super
smooth
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
all
too
easy
to
drink
not
sure
how
it
would
age
but
its
already
so
mellow
it
doesnt
need
it
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
complexity
but
this
was
a
solid
drink
overallan
outstanding
beer
the
original
gbs
is
excellent
and
they
found
a
way
to
improve
and
enhance
it
without
changing
the
classic
tastes
you
except
very
impressive
review
is
very
similar
to
the
regular
gbs
review
except
that
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
knocks
off
some
of
the
sugar
and
sweetness
making
a
much
more
complex
and
flavorful
beer
i
prefer
this
over
regular
gbs
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
bourbon
not
overpowering
but
just
enough
to
calm
the
sugar
down
appropriately
very
smooth
and
drinkable
in
response
to
greesyfizeek
this
should
be
medium
bodied
this
is
a
really
decadent
and
tasty
treat
everything
about
this
beer
was
pleasing
it
had
a
great
nose
beautiful
balanced
flavors
and
a
really
nice
medium
carbonation
that
played
well
with
the
spices
in
the
beer
my
only
knock
was
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
felt
a
little
thin
overall
i
would
seek
it
out
again
second
chance
at
this
beer
and
enjoyed
it
more
the
second
time
which
is
less
normal
these
days
glad
i
have
one
in
the
fridge
at
home
really
nice
beer
hardywood
does
it
right
o
in
years
past
ive
criticized
this
variant
of
gbs
for
not
adding
anything
to
the
base
beer
i
stand
corrected
the
subtle
complexity
added
by
the
barrels
here
makes
this
an
improvement
over
the
original
albeit
a
very
slight
one
bourbon
gbs
is
a
remarkable
beer
derived
from
a
similarly
remarkable
beer
from
a
brewery
that
knows
it
has
a
golden
goose
on
its
hands
and
is
squeezing
every
penny
they
can
out
of
it
and
they
should
as
this
is
utterly
unique
and
inspires
years
worth
of
sentiment
and
fond
feelings
of
christmases
past
present
and
to
come
fluffy
and
velvety
a
vast
improvement
over
the
regular
to
me
very
good
better
bigger
creamier
and
boozier
than
the
base
the
bourbon
flavors
only
come
out
in
the
finish
but
it
definitely
added
a
smoothness
to
the
whole
experience
my
complaint
about
gbs
is
that
its
a
bit
to
thin
but
that
problem
has
been
solved
here
otasty
but
i
would
like
just
a
little
more
bourbon
barrel
character
sugary
gooey
goodness
real
gingerbread
in
a
glass
all
mixed
in
with
bourbon
and
theres
hints
of
vanilla
sprinkled
in
there
nice
and
sweet
but
never
cloying
this
one
delivers
on
its
promise
very
very
good
stuff
a
great
beer
for
spice
lovers
though
not
much
bourbon
character
comes
through
really
nice
beer
what
really
gets
me
about
this
beer
is
how
hugely
drinkable
it
is
very
sweet
with
nice
complexity
but
at
10
6
this
drinks
like
its
about
half
of
that
feel
is
rich
without
being
overwhelming
and
the
thinner
body
actually
works
great
here
a
pretty
undertheradar
stout
and
definitely
one
to
seek
out
pours
a
clear
super
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
gingerbread
christmas
spice
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
gingerbread
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
great
gingerbread
and
barrel
aged
presence
that
comes
across
much
better
in
the
smell
to
me
overall
about
as
big
as
a
milk
stout
gets
it
seems
and
quite
tasty
much
better
than
i
had
in
the
past
too
very
nice
overall
the
slighest
of
barrel
characters
wish
there
were
more
but
its
still
very
good
very
tasty
and
a
beer
i
never
thought
id
get
a
chance
to
taste
much
appreciated
and
quite
tasty
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
my
favorite
offering
from
hardywood
to
date
was
quite
dissapointed
by
the
standard
version
upon
popping
the
cork
you
can
immediately
tell
that
overcarbonation
wont
be
an
issue
here
not
a
particularly
robust
aroma
hints
of
ginger
cookie
bourbon
spice
the
flavor
profile
opens
up
a
bit
with
clear
defined
notes
of
ginger
molasses
chocolate
coconut
bourbon
and
the
like
to
me
the
intended
flavor
profile
works
a
lot
better
in
this
version
not
without
its
flaws
though
a
bit
thin
and
12
weeks
in
a
barrel
seems
a
little
rushed
o
overall
a
damn
fine
brew
i
like
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
and
i
like
the
subtlety
of
the
bourbon
as
it
plays
with
the
ginger
and
dances
around
the
chocolate
fine
work
a
very
delightful
beer
i
enjoyed
the
base
but
felt
it
was
overcarbonated
this
one
hits
on
all
counts
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
one
without
getting
tired
of
it
poured
from
bomber
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
along
with
a
thin
lacing
head
that
lasts
slightly
throughout
aromas
are
cocoa
toffee
gentle
roast
and
toast
mellow
cinnamon
ginger
and
spice
touches
of
oak
vanilla
more
gentle
barrel
experience
but
it
still
covers
up
the
spice
a
bit
initial
is
sweeter
darker
cocoa
and
vanilla
gentle
spirit
ginger
cinnamon
some
vanilla
life
middle
is
sweeter
cinnamon
and
ginger
presence
some
creamy
vanilla
and
nice
sweetness
at
times
spirit
toast
toffee
a
touch
sweet
cinnamon
and
spice
assert
into
finish
nice
flavors
gingerbread
some
spirit
vanilla
gentle
spiciness
lingers
with
mellow
heat
toffee
and
creamy
sweetness
overall
a
fine
beer
and
cannot
go
wrong
this
one
or
the
regular
although
i
do
prefer
the
latter
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
slightly
more
complex
than
the
standard
gbs
but
not
notably
better
vanilla
flavors
by
far
poke
out
of
this
more
than
in
the
standard
version
and
the
nice
heat
from
the
bourbon
gives
a
notably
good
addition
to
the
total
package
here
glad
to
have
tried
this
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
most
amazing
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
it
will
leave
you
feeling
in
a
state
of
utopia
until
youve
crashed
and
yearning
to
have
another
taste
lets
see
if
hardywood
will
do
it
better
next
time
oh
yeah
the
first
line
was
nearly
two
hours
before
i
got
my
limit
of
two
bottles
who
knows
what
itll
be
like
next
season
o
as
this
beer
has
aged
the
overall
flavor
has
really
bumped
up
a
notch
the
complexity
of
the
original
gbs
is
starting
to
fill
back
in
while
the
ba
falls
off
but
is
still
present
overall
i
enjoyed
this
version
much
more
than
the
original
version
which
tasted
way
to
gingerforward
and
almost
like
a
messy
homebrew
the
barrel
aging
has
imparted
very
little
bourbon
flavors
which
is
good
imo
for
this
style
of
beer
and
adds
a
pleasant
vanilla
and
maple
sweetness
with
a
light
ginger
spicing
in
the
background
glad
i
didnt
dismiss
this
after
not
loving
the
original
o
i
enjoyed
this
but
expected
more
after
having
had
the
regular
version
recently
barrel
was
very
subtle
and
didnt
add
to
the
base
the
way
that
i
hoped
it
would
mahogany
brown
pour
deep
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
tan
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
and
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
bottle
was
open
well
before
i
got
to
it
and
thus
had
a
few
moments
to
breathe
sweet
aroma
caramel
cinnamon
ginger
booze
more
like
flavored
vodka
than
bourbon
as
in
the
regular
version
there
was
a
definite
cookie
taste
going
on
like
a
little
debbie
oatmeal
creme
pie
but
it
wasnt
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
hoped
and
in
this
version
it
was
also
competing
with
the
vanillabourbonbooze
flavors
regardless
of
that
i
do
think
that
this
version
tasted
better
and
the
bourbon
aging
improved
it
though
there
was
still
a
bitter
woody
unpleasant
aspect
to
the
beer
again
like
the
original
my
main
beef
with
this
beer
was
the
body
its
quite
thin
for
a
stout
and
leaning
more
towards
an
english
stout
or
brown
ale
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
they
tweak
gbs
and
try
to
improve
it
in
the
future
but
considering
the
hype
over
it
its
probably
not
going
to
change
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
but
its
not
worth
standing
in
line
for
however
many
hours
to
get
it
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
this
odd
coconut
flavor
to
it
that
grows
with
every
sip
until
it
is
all
i
can
taste
i
heard
this
tasted
different
on
draft
and
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
it
but
ultimately
the
beer
was
not
ginger
enough
too
much
coconut
or
whatever
that
was
and
too
thin
not
a
repeat
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
almost
no
headlacing
the
nose
is
a
pungent
nutmeg
with
none
of
the
other
spices
or
notes
of
bourbon
that
id
expected
the
taste
brings
a
lot
more
ginger
and
spice
forward
but
the
bourbon
still
doesnt
make
an
appearance
as
id
expected
from
the
beers
appearance
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
mildmedium
bodied
but
does
have
a
lot
more
spice
specifically
ginger
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
with
great
spice
and
the
ginger
i
was
hoping
for
but
the
nose
didnt
pop
with
the
christmas
season
or
bourbon
as
id
hoped
overall
this
was
about
on
par
with
the
regular
version
not
really
better
or
worse
the
bourbon
added
a
nice
dimension
to
it
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
to
come
through
also
some
of
the
flavors
from
the
original
beer
were
just
a
tad
muted
overall
hardywood
makes
another
crazy
awesome
beer
honestly
i
hope
that
gbs
and
ba
gbs
are
going
to
be
a
winter
tradition
for
the
brewers
at
hardywood
gbs
ba
gbs
are
the
best
christmas
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
and
no
other
beer
even
comes
remotely
close
the
barrel
really
complements
the
beer
it
still
lets
alot
of
the
flavors
of
the
base
beer
shine
through
and
accent
all
of
the
regular
gbs
flavors
very
unique
solid
hard
to
describe
better
than
that
thanks
for
the
share
egrace84
truly
outstanding
a
great
example
of
an
already
fantastic
base
stout
being
taken
to
new
heights
by
bourbon
barrel
aging
if
you
can
get
this
do
o
my
anticipation
was
high
for
this
beer
as
i
was
curious
as
to
how
the
gingerbread
flavor
would
react
to
the
introduction
of
bourbon
barrel
character
im
actually
pretty
floored
in
how
well
this
turned
out
sure
the
ginger
flavor
is
no
longer
in
the
spotlight
but
a
good
bit
of
complexity
takes
its
place
to
take
this
beer
to
a
completely
new
level
if
sticking
strickly
to
the
holiday
theme
the
original
gbs
is
probably
the
better
choice
overall
though
i
think
the
bourbon
gbs
brings
the
best
overall
packagecomplexity
and
is
no
doubt
a
fantastic
bourbon
barrel
offering
o
this
beer
is
outstanding
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
stouts
ive
ever
had
perfect
beer
for
christmas
day
with
the
family
i
will
seek
out
more
hardywood
in
the
future
overall
i
prefer
this
to
the
regular
version
the
balance
was
spot
on
the
spice
level
was
great
id
definitely
have
more
o
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
is
a
lot
better
than
gbs
in
my
opinion
while
some
of
the
spices
have
been
lost
to
the
barrel
aging
the
bourbon
has
added
more
than
it
has
taken
away
enough
of
the
base
beer
remains
to
be
appreciated
which
is
a
key
for
me
with
barrel
aging
youve
outdone
yourselves

the
bourbon
version
of
gingerbread
stout
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
2011
version
of
the
regular
gingerbread
stout
but
with
some
oak
and
bourbon
taste
to
it
the
spices
are
a
bit
subdued
after
12
weeks
in
a
barrel
the
mouthfeel
smell
and
taste
are
all
great
from
the
bottle
i
tried
the
draft
at
the
release
party
and
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
the
bottle
version
the
beer
is
opaque
with
a
thick
beige
head
the
head
lasts
for
a
few
moments
before
fading
to
nil
the
aroma
offers
cinnamon
vanilla
nutmeg
oak
barrel
the
flavor
is
a
step
up
from
the
aroma
lots
of
holiday
spices
with
only
a
touch
of
bourbon
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
beautifully
balanced
like
eating
a
gingerbread
cookie
sweet
but
never
cloying
a
great
beer
for
the
holidays
this
is
a
solid
chocolate
milk
stout
its
not
as
exciting
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
was
still
extremely
satisfying
odell
is
a
solid
brewery
and
this
is
a
solid
brew
its
really
smooth
and
not
overly
carbonated
great
mouthfeel
and
thought
its
strong
for
a
stout
8
5
its
not
overpowering
in
fact
there
wasnt
a
the
alcohol
bite
you
normally
get
from
an
8
5
beer
id
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
stout
that
wont
disappoint
you
pours
a
black
color
with
a
two
finger
brown
sugar
color
head
aroma
is
roast
coffee
chocolate
and
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
is
chocolate
light
roast
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
mediumthick
a
bit
thinner
than
some
stouts
but
that
by
no
means
takes
away
from
this
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
had
and
the
chocolate
makes
it
all
the
more
so
very
chocolaty
great
milk
stout
overall
great
tasting
nice
aroma
hits
all
the
right
notes
throughout
pretty
well
made
stout
overall
very
good
beer
if
you
like
the
style
check
it
out
condor
recommended
and
approved
love
when
beer
tastes
exactly
as
advertised
tasted
like
drinking
a
hershey
bar
without
being
overly
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
wasnt
to
heavy
finished
creamy
yet
also
pretty
carbonated
drank
like
a
chocolate
soda
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
really
different
and
pretty
delicious
big
fan
im
drinking
this
for
the
second
time
in
a
week

abv

a

definite
chocolate
notes
in
the

as
well
as
roasted
coffee
tastes
of
milk
chocolate
without
being
sickly
sweet
and
has
coffee
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
feels
like
you
actually
had
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
drinks
really
easy
for
a
nice
abv
this
was
just
tapped
at
the
ginger
man
here
locally
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
draught
cheers
very
chocolaty
a
little
boozy
yet
somewhat
poundable
sweet
stout
with
milk
chocolate
taste
not
as
dry
or
bitter
as
other
stouts
smooth
drinking
for
the
high
abv
o
nicely
put
together
in
all
areas
excels
in
taste
and
feel
probably
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
had
so
many
of
these
taste
like
someone
dumped
cocoa
into
a
beer
the
depth
and
richness
of
flavor
here
stands
out
i
rarely
ever
pour
a
beer
out
and
i
love
odell
but
this
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
so
much
so
it
tastes
artificial
like
2
milk
mixed
with
nutrasweet
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
if
you
let
this
beer
age
in
the
refrigerator
for
a
year
a
miracle
will
happen
it
lost
all
of
its
alcohol
taste
became
a
little
more
sweeter
and
the
chocolate
was
much
more
intense
the
consistency
seemed
to
be
thicker
as
well
and
so
much
smoother
thought
i
was
drinking
a
five
dollar
shake
this
was
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
only
second
to
stranahans
aged
yeti
overall
a
tasty
stout
worth
a
try
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
this
is
an
excellent
stout
dark
as
night
packed
with
milk
chocolate
flavor
and
high
enough
alcohol
to
really
get
your
attention
many
stouts
are
bitter
but
this
one
is
not
available
in
fourpacks
and
a
bit
more
expensive
than
most
similar
beers
but
very
much
worth
it
fairly
light
milk
stout
very
drinkableeven
id
think
on
a
warm
eveningbut
best
of
all
the
layers
of
chocolate
shine
through
much
clearer
and
cleaner
than
many
other
chocolatepremised
stouts
ive
had
nice
sweetness
toeing
the
line
nicely
between
clean
and
cloyingand
aided
in
this
by
the
very
detectable
presence
of
the
chocolate
notes
and
their
attendant
bitterness
not
much
nose
outside
of
dry
malty
sugars
and
the
faintest
hint
of
lactose
carried
though
out
of
the
tulips
curve
very
dark
and
slightly
mahoganybrown
when
held
to
light
this
somewhat
still
light
mouthfeel
stout
seems
to
fairly
well
achieve
its
endsthough
i
think
given
the
sweetness
itd
pair
much
better
with
a
hunk
of
meat
than
a
dessert
thick
and
dark
with
a
nice
amber
head
though
it
doesnt
stay
around
very
long
this
is
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
had
to
date
and
my
personal
favorite
beer
as
of
yet
odell
does
it
right
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
4
pack
seasonal
big
time
edit
i
just
realized
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
stout
i
know
that
porters
are
stouts
and
stouts
are
porters
but
this
changes
things
this
is
a
little
weak
for
a
stout
too
carbonated
too
light
still
good
carry
on
o
its
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
and
solid
execution
its
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
as
well
o
if
you
like
chocolate
and
you
like
stouts
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
tasty
as
hell
almost
enjoyed
this
more
closer
to
bottle
date
than
aged
overall
wow
this
is
so
good
definitely
would
have
this
again
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
lactose
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
lactose
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
cocoa
and
lactose
characteristics
o
this
is
great
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
the
chocolate
is
prominent
but
its
just
about
the
only
flavor
i
get
wish
this
was
more
complex
i
know
there
are
so
many
other
milk
stouts
out
there
that
are
great
but
this
is
the
best
chocolate
milk
stout
i
have
tasted
so
far
if
you
want
the
next
best
thing
to
chocolate
milk
with
alcohol
then
this
is
the
beer
to
give
it
to
you
this
is
one
of
my
every
day
beers
to
drink
on
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
but
it
is
one
the
far
side
of
sweet
for
the
style
odell
lugene
chocolate
milk
stout
45
pours
out
a
very
deep
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
the
color
of
chocolate
milk
smells
of
chocolate
chocolate
malt
bready
malts
and
a
bit
of
euro
hops
chocolate
isnt
as
strong
as
the
nose
as
i
would
have
expected
this
beer
is
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
nice
chocolate
flavor
but
it
needs
some
bitterness
either
from
roasted
grain
or
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
get
a
kind
of
jelly
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
that
im
not
fond
of
mouthfeel
is
moderatefull
and
sticky
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
does
an
exceptional
job
of
hiding
alcohol
needs
more
balance
with
the
sweetness
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
wish
the
nose
was
a
little
more
inductive
of
the
nice
taste
but
thats
my
only
real
criticism
smooth
and
dreamy
like
a
sickeningly
sweet
pop
song
that
ends
with
an
unexpected
kick
love
it
i
can
forgive
the
higher
abv
for
my
liking
cause
this
is
so
flavorful
and
enjoyable
to
drink
a
really
good
imperial
sweet
stout
highly
recommended
o
excellent
beer
not
much
out
there
like
it
very
good
i
wouldnt
call
it
easy
to
drink
as
its
a
sipping
beer
thanks
go
to
craig
for
the
beer
initial
pour
is
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
first
sniff
i
cant
detect
anything
then
it
hits
you
in
the
backend
of
creamy
chocolate
a
nice
fairly
sweet
beer
really
tastes
like
milk
has
been
used
in
the
brewing
process
not
a
strong
chocolate
taste
at
all
but
the
milk
is
highly
detectable
fairly
strong
alcohol
finish
i
really
liked
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
chocolate
obviously
and
hazelnuts
o
i
never
bothered
to
get
a
4
pack
of
this
beer
but
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
on
tap
i
think
the
nitro
tap
helped
this
beers
mouthfeel
and
appearance
i
bet
the
bottled
version
wouldnt
drink
nearly
as
well
great
stuff
one
of
my
new
favorite
milk
stouts
up
there
with
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
aside
from
that
i
do
like
this
o
a
great
session
stout
a
very
good
milk
stout
true
to
form
for
the
style
mmmm
have
now
enjoyed
3
bottles
of
this
at
various
temperatures
cold
warming
and
nearly
room
temperature
and
it
works
at
all
3
levels
a
nearly
silkly
smooth
stout
about
as
close
to
nitro
as
you
can
get
wo
being
nitro
and
a
perfect
level
of
chocolate
flavor
i
cant
stand
chocolate
stouts
that
are
too
heavy
on
the
chocolate
its
beer
not
yoohoo
ok
well
thats
more
like
it
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
just
how
incredibly
creamy
and
smoothe
it
is
its
decently
carbonated
too
so
to
have
the
effervescence
playing
off
your
tongue
and
still
have
an
overwhelmingly
creamy
experience
its
a
good
un
the
flavours
are
as
you
would
expect
sweet
creamy
chocolate
dominates
everything
else
with
the
sweet
being
bolstered
by
a
definite
lactose
sweetness
i
figured
this
would
be
dessert
and
it
fits
that
bill
quite
well
theres
some
general
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
the
thought
of
considerations
of
coffee
perhaps
though
that
could
just
be
a
pavlovian
response
to
expecting
to
find
it
in
dark
beers
milky
syrupy
goodness
through
and
through
glossy
sable
black
decent
head
of
mocha
that
dissipates
quickly
great
looking
beer
smell
is
an
initial
flash
of
piney
crispfruit
hops
like
grapes
no
real
chocolate
but
some
coffee
lightly
taste
is
an
odd
thing
initial
taste
is
of
vinous
fruitiness
like
grapes
not
what
im
expecting
from
a
selfdeclared
chocolate
milk
stout
throws
off
the
whole
beer
there
is
some
light
pseudo
cocoa
tates
but
the
overall
impression
is
of
apple
sweetness
herbaly
hops
and
an
odd
finish
taste
is
poor
i
do
not
care
for
this
beer
this
is
odells
winter
milk
stout
made
with
chocolate
overall
the
beer
smells
good
and
taste
decent
but
its
the
flabby
wet
finish
that
really
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
just
prefer
my
stouts
to
finish
a
tad
more
dry
for
being
8
5
the
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
just
not
really
my
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
strongly
sweet
beer
not
quite
a
creamy
and
sweet
as
other
chocolate
stouts
but
still
very
chocolatey
in
a
darker
way
malt
flavors
and
higher
alcohol
combine
to
make
this
the
adult
version
of
lighter
and
sweeter
chocolate
stouts
o
4
0
its
good
but
not
amazing
pours
very
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
small
instantly
disappearing
beige
head
seems
quite
fizzy
too
leaving
a
nice
sugary
layer
on
the
glass
aroma
has
milky
chocolate
some
fruity
dark
malts
and
caramel
flavor
is
quite
chocolaty
too
faint
vanilla
caramel
malts
and
lingering
fruitiness
on
the
finish
strong
carbonation
creamy
roasty
sugary
and
chocolaty
palate
could
have
been
a
bit
heavier
on
the
body
and
a
bit
less
carbonated
still
quite
nice
though
overall
pretty
nice
not
the
best
chocolate
stout
in
my
opinion
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
that
has
an
actual
milk
chocolate
taste
to
it
and
is
balanced
with
a
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
i
could
sit
around
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
drink
a
couple
no
problem
its
smooth
and
pleasant
and
not
pushy
definitely
worth
a
try
and
in
a
try
i
mean
you
might
as
well
buy
a
four
pack
overall
i
dont
love
the
style
but
this
has
a
great
chocolate
flavor
lugene
pours
a
black
color
with
very
little
head
at
all
there
is
a
boozy
chocolate
like
aroma
the
taste
is
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
wwith
a
strong
milk
or
lactose
sugar
flavor
a
lot
of
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
well
good
full
flavors
nice
body
crisp
carbonation
overall
its
a
boozier
chocolaty
stout
i
enjoy
left
hands
milk
stout
so
i
thought
i
would
really
be
happy
with
this
imperial
milk
stout
i
like
the
flavor
profile
it
is
sweet
rich
and
complex
as
hopped
for
and
of
course
you
can
sense
the
alcohol
at
8
5
abv
however
all
other
aspects
of
the
beer
fall
short
the
aroma
isnt
particularly
inspiring
and
the
carbonation
is
way
too
fizzy
not
only
does
this
give
the
beer
a
head
more
reminiscent
of
a
soda
than
a
craftstout
but
the
mouthfeel
is
no
longer
creamy
perhaps
doing
this
on
nitro
would
correct
that
for
me
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
not
quite
good
good
enough
to
warrant
purchasing
another
premiumpriced
4pack
in
the
near
future
hated
this
beer
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
oh
well
went
very
well
with
a
chocolate
cheesecake
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
milk
stout
a
complete
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
cant
taste
the
abv
at
all
all
hail
odell
d
this
one
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
on
several
levels
the
abv
is
8
5
much
higher
than
your
typical
milk
stout
and
it
was
also
amazingly
smooth
not
too
complex
but
what
it
does
it
does
very
well
an
outstanding
brew
seek
it
out
onice
beer
i
bought
a
single
of
this
and
thought
it
read
chocolate
mint
stout
time
for
reading
glasses
i
guess
nicely
done
beer
could
drink
a
couple
or
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
reminiscent
of
guinness
in
terms
of
appearance
as
dark
brown
as
you
can
go
without
being
black
does
not
let
light
through
smell
that
roasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
its
dessert
time
like
carbonatedalcoholic
chocolate
milk
sans
milk
viscous
mouthfeel
somewhat
of
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
tasty
brew
paired
well
with
the
chocolate
cupcakes
we
had
for
dessert
a
nice
way
to
finish
the
night
great
beer
with
a
wonderful
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
if
it
wasnt
for
the
abv
great
story
behind
the
name
as
well
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
ive
had
in
bottle
nitro
and
draft
as
well
as
a
few
firkins
i
keep
going
back
o
excellent
milk
chocolate
stout
not
too
sweet
like
a
lot
of
these
are
but
sweet
nonetheless
nice
full
smooth
body
lends
to
excellent
drinkability
a
little
savory
umami
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
to
an
otherwise
pure
chocolate
milk
stout
nice
brew
consumed
on
61413
overall
i
will
definitely
purchaserate
this
again
ive
had
it
before
and
remember
it
being
so
much
better
im
not
familiar
with
infected
beers
but
this
could
be
my
first
perhaps
my
senses
were
shot
after
that
mycenary
i
know
this
is
a
far
better
brew
than
my
rating
has
shown
im
saddened
well
see
overall
i
think
the
longer
i
drink
this
the
more
chocolate
milk
comes
out
at
first
it
seems
like
a
bunch
of
individual
parts
thrown
together
but
in
the
end
it
made
more
sense
do
relatively
strong
for
a
milk
stout
this
beer
hides
its
8
5
abv
well
as
it
delivers
the
promised
chocolate
while
the
smell
is
simplistic
the
taste
is
focused
on
chocolate
but
with
enough
room
for
other
features
it
is
texturally
very
strong
doing
everything
that
a
stout
should
o
exceptional
beer
i
could
drink
this
any
time
of
the
year
so
i
am
sad
that
it
is
a
seasonal
if
you
see
this
and
havent
had
it
you
should
overall
delicious
this
just
became
my
favorite
milk
stout
o
boozy
chocolate
milk
this
one
is
balanced
well
and
complex
ill
pick
more
of
this
up
and
other
odell
finds
whenever
im
in
mn
next

produced

was
not

retained

fell
down

good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
have
again
overall
an
incredible
enjoyable

how

kids
as
well
o
solid
milk
stout
and
one
i
would
go
to
again
i
was
expecting
more
but
still
a
good
beer
o
milk
chocolate
and
easy
drinking
solid
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
and
pretty
creamy
again
though
it
turns
a
bit
hot
on
the
end
and
drinkability
is
not
high
at
all
very
much
a
oneanddone
type
of
beer
overall
a
very
flavorful
milk
stout
that
is
pretty
enjoyable
and
unique
would
probably
buy
again
at
some
point
if
given
the
chance
i
remember
when
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
was
first
tasted
i
thought
it
was
the
most
sultry
thing
i
had
ever
tasted
though
there
have
been
more
advancement
in
chocolate
body
alcohol
and
sweetness
none
has
yet
to
capture
that
type
of
taste
in
elevated
form
til
now
this
should
be
a
highly
celebrated
ale
for
such
humble
underpinnings
i
have
a
feeling
lugene
has
a
pint
or
two
waiting
for
him
and
not
on
his
dime
overall
this
is
my
favorite
chocolate
stout
i
like
the
sweetness
i
like
the
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
and
its
just
delicious
to
sip
on
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
say
this
a
must
try
final
thoughts
ive
been
a
fan
of
odell
brewing
company
ever
since
getting
into
craft
and
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
a
stout
from
them
lugene
milk
chocolate
stout
does
not
disappoint
if
you
enjoy
dark
creamy
beers
then
give
it
a
try
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
the
body
is
sweet
to
me
its
too
sweet
would
have
liked
it
toned
down
but
that
is
part
of
the
appeal
there
is
a
oatmeal
like
texture
as
well
carbonation
is
soft
which
helps
the
milky
feel
linger
overall
nice
chocolate
notes
but
could
use
some
more
stout
characters
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
o
overall
this
brew
is
fantastic
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
i
could
easily
toss
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
nice
to
find
a
rich
brew
higher
in
abv
that
can
be
easily
sessioned
i
wish
my
inlaws
were
able
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
but
im
definitely
glad
they
were
able
to
get
the
one
highly
recommended
really
enjoyed
this
the
abv
is
well
hidden
if
you
like
chocolate
this
a
stellar
offering
ill
take
this
over
the
uberhyped
boulevard
chocolate
ale
true
to
style
but
wish
this
wouldve
delivered
a
bit
more
on
the
asthetics
serve
in
tap
at
the
brewery
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
full
of
deep
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
vanilla
chocolate
and
lactose
sugar
the
taste
starts
with
chocolate
and
roast
and
is
followed
by
hefty
vanilla
extract
notes
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
with
low
carbonation
overall
nice
flavors
here
with
a
light
overall
character
for
such
a
strong
milk
stout
o
a
solid
and
well
balanced
beer
maybe
not
as
aggressive
with
the
chocolate
flavors
as
some
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
tangy
and
surprisingly
drinkable
though
you
really
have
to
like
chocolate
a
lot
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
jubilation
fine
wines
in
albuquerque
pair
this
with
the
cd
isaac
hayes
chocolate
chip
then
move
on
sweet
stout
really
pairs
well
with
desserts
or
as
one
the
chocolate
notes
are
spot
on
and
deliver
what
is
promised
on
the
label
slow
sipper
and
falls
right
in
line
with
the
other
good
offerings
in
the
odell
series
overall
a
really
good
sweetmilk
stout
good
creamy
chocolate
flavor
with
a
moderate
sweetness
really
nailed
the
style
overall
a
really
great
milk
stout
oi
like
this
beer
but
it
is
suffering
from
something
of
an
identity
crisis
when
i
think
of
milk
stouts
i
think
of
lower
abv
creamier
style
beers
this
brew
however
drinks
more
like
a
chocolateinfused
ris
than
a
sweetmilk
stout
the
flavors
here
are
intense
and
the
alcohol
is
vocal
and
while
these
are
not
bad
things
i
found
myself
looking
for
a
bit
more
subtlety
and
nuance
overall
i
really
liked
it
it
is
the
sweetest
beer
i
have
had
yet
which
is
to
a
degree
that
is
its
only
downfall
very
good
though

this
was
my
first
milk
stout
and
it
lived
up
to
its
promise
appearance
was
chocolatey
dark
with
very
little
head
taste
at
first
favored
a
roasty
nature
but
as
i
drank
more
the
chocolate
and
sweetness
came
through
virtually
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
which
suited
me
i
did
not
match
this
well
with
dinner
salmon
but
it
went
perfectly
with
dessert
a
chocolate
coconut
caramel
cupcake
that
was
an
ideal
combination
a
really
nice
beer
definitely
nails
the
chocolate
milk
but
has
enough
beer
to
it
that
i
dont
feel
like
an
elementary
school
kid
watching
afternoon
cartoons
quite
good
and
one
ill
pick
up
again
overall
solid
all
around
nice
balance
very
drinkable
overall
absolutely
delicious
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
ever
this
is
a
big
brew
12oz
bottle
took
a
while
to
conquer
though
i
did
not
complain
once
seek
this
one
out
for
something
completely
different
this
beer
was
sent
to
me
by
ghb
thanks
man
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
looking
brown
head
on
top
the
retention
is
decent
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
and
has
a
subtle
sweetness
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
good
a
very
nice
balanced
roasted
creamy
sweetness
with
a
chocolaty
bittersweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
overall
its
a
very
good
brew
cant
wait
to
have
more
good
but
the
overly
pressing
lactose
puts
me
off
some
overrides
the
rest
of
the
otherwise
quality
flavors
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
melted
milk
chocolate
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
beneath
the
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
notes
rounding
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
silky
chewy
texture
and
appropriately
mild
carbonation
overall
this
might
not
be
a
mind
blowing
chocolate
stout
but
it
is
a
damn
good
one
i
like
lugene
quite
a
bit
im
glad
odell
put
out
this
kind
of
beer
i
think
i
prefer
it
over
samuel
smiths
new
chocolate
stout
overall
this
was
a
nice
extra
great
on
this
cold
snowy
nh
night
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
beer
brewed
with
lactose
sugar
behind
three
floyds
apocalypse
cow
though
of
course
both
are
completely
different
beers
point
being
when
i
saw
the
odell
type
label
but
one
that
i
didnt
recognize
i
scooped
one
up
to
buy
before
i
even
knew
exactly
what
it
was
and
this
is
for
good
reason
odell
really
does
not
disappoint
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
have
more
of
this
overall
im
a
big
milk
stout
fan
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
big
flavors
while
being
very
drinkable
glad
i
picked
up
a
4
pack
and
i
might
have
to
get
another
one
before
its
gone
odelicious
stout
with
lucious
chocolate
flavor
and
gr
eat
smoothness
really
enjoyable
after
dinner
overall
do
not
drink
this
beer
unless
you
really
enjoy
chocolate
because
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
chocolatiest
beers
that
i
have
drank
another
really
enjoyable
beer
from
this
brewery
that
stilll
seems
to
remain
a
secret
i
have
no
idea
why
either
the
are
always
brewing
fantastic
everyday
beers
that
are
approachable
for
the
craft
beer
newbie
but
still
satisfy
a
dercerning
palate
of
a
vertern
craft
beer
drinker
nice
beer
odells
this
one
is
just
as
good
as
moo
hoo
by
terrapin
maybe
even
a
little
better
overall
an
ok
milk
stout
with
a
few
off
notes
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
pricey
at
10
per
4
pack
medium
to
full
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
the
palate
immediately
reminds
me
of
southern
tiers
chocolate
stouts
rather
artificial
creamy
and
sweet
some
kind
of
metallic
cocoa
powder
on
the
finish
maybe
a
bit
of
coffee
is
buried
in
here
somewhere
as
well
im
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
of
this
one
o
a
great
beer
its
definitely
a
desert
beer
best
milk
stout
i
have
tried
yet
let
it
warm
up
the
chocolate
flavors
become
more
defined
as
is
warms
o
this
is
a
really
good
odell
has
blown
me
away
with
all
their
new
awesome
beers
o
tasty
if
a
bit
sweet
hey
this
is
a
sweet
stout
milk
chocolate
and
lactose
comes
through
brilliantly
pretty
nice
my
take
a
sweet
and
excellent
beer
not
overpowering
enough
to
make
a
bad
day
great
but
the
perfect
compliment
to
other
quiet
joys
this
beer
makes
me
happy
overall
this
is
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
chocolate
notes
to
come
through
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
something
id
drink
much
of
too
high
on
the
abv
scale
for
me
feels
sweet
and
smooth
carbonation
is
just
right
to
get
the
feel
of
the
chocolate
nice
beer
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
pours
thick
and
dark
with
a
brownish
head
wowchocolate
jumps
from
the
glass
first
sip
tells
you
this
is
something
to
be
savored
velvety
mouthfeel
and
full
deep
rich
flavor
this
beer
is
decadent
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
1
okay
3
in
a
sitting
the
vanilla
character
complements
the
chocolate
and
sweet
lactose
flavor
very
well
wish
is
was
a
bit
drier
rather
than
sweet
but
after
all
it
is
a
milk
stout
chocolate
milk
for
adults
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
find
it

dark

with
a

powder
alcohol
slightly
sweet
ive
read
lots
of
comparisons
to
chocolate
milk
and
while
this
is
indeed
chocolate
heavy
i
really
dont
agree
its
just
chocolate
beer
honestly
a
glass
of
horizon
chocolate
milk
tastes
better
than
this
does
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
does
taste
like
chocolate
milk
so
i
guess
i
should
have
had
different
expectations
in
any
event
this
is
a
tasty
brew
if
a
bit
odd
pours
a
dead
sexy
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
tall
foamy
head
the
color
believe
it
or
not
of
nesquick
chocolate
milk
a
few
inches
tall
and
really
bubbly
i
smell
sweet
chocolate
and
lactose
sugars
as
promised
its
not
sugary
though
like
a
normal
milk
stout
its
just
balanced
out
like
a
bar
of
semisweet
chocolate
of
the
finest
quality
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
earthy
dark
malt
character
maybe
some
dark
german
malt
would
have
rounded
this
out
a
bit
for
now
its
just
really
chocolate
heavy
the
feel
though
itsnt
heavy
at
all
the
alcohol
is
invisible
and
the
body
is
quite
light
for
a
big
stout
plenty
of
carbonation
also
keeps
it
light
but
id
like
to
try
this
one
from
the
bottle
before
i
make
any
permanent
judgements
overall
a
clever
new
odell
brew
who
can
really
do
no
wrong
as
far
as
im
concerned
overall
this
is
exactly
as
advertised
a
chocolate
milk
stout
quite
enjoyable
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
bite
andor
dryness
this
is
wonderful
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
beer
odell
does
it
again
dessert
in
a
bottle
much
like
those
chocolate
cream
liquors
godiva
etc
you
can
buy
now
wow
am
i
digging
this
d
i
love
the
chocolate
character
but
its
too
restrained
and
largely
unremarkable
pretty
average
this
brew
is
fantastic
it
would
be
amazing
with
a
drop
shot
of
baileys
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
highly
recommended
and
should
be
tried
by
everyone
appearance
and
aroma
are
the
only
things
lacking
a
great
brew
with
a
great
logolabel
another
home
run
odell
keep
it
up
o
i
had
been
dying
to
see
this
on
the
store
shelves
i
am
not
disappointed
it
is
a
great
stout
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
will
enjoy
the
4
pack
another
great
offering
from
odell
pours
a
dark
deep
brown
with
a
nice
mocha
head
not
much
if
any
lacing
though
a
sweet
mildly
rich
aroma
of
some
melted
milk
chocolate
lactic
sugars
and
just
a
touch
of
some
roasted
malt
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
chocolateystarts
off
with
the
sweetness
from
the
sugar
the
chocolate
builds
and
midtsream
it
is
coming
at
you
full
bore
like
the
taste
of
a
melted
milk
chocolate
bar
sitting
in
your
mouth
and
a
kiss
of
vanilla
in
as
it
finishes
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
some
roastiness
there
as
well
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidden
in
this
one
this
is
pretty
much
chocolate
milk
for
those
older
than
21
a
fuller
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
odell
with
another
winner
that
shines
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
having
tried
a
few
of
the
pilot
batches
that
lead
to
lugene
this
was
definitely
not
my
favorite
overall
variation
thpugh
it
is
certainly
up
there
chocolate
oar
with
it
being
roastier
and
not
as
sweet
was
my
favorite
and
id
have
loved
for
them
to
have
kept
that
type
of
sweetroasty
balance
for
this
one
that
said
i
am
certainly
happy
with
what
they
did
finally
come
up
wih
and
its
about
time
odell
has
a
nice
bottled
stout
on
the
shelves
if
you
like
sweeter
milk
chocolate
if
you
like
beer
you
should
like
this
great
milk
stout
has
kind
of
an
imperial
taste
tastes
more
alcoholic
than
it
is
ogreat
beer
with
a
great
mixture
of
aromas
and
flavors
i
would
call
this
a
chocolate
stout
before
i
would
a
milk
stout
its
definitely
tasty
and
easy
drinking
not
overly
sweet
and
not
complex
i
would
recommend
this
and
will
buy
it
again
ive
really
enjoyed
their
offerings
and
look
forward
to
finding
more
of
their
brews
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
over
the
weekend
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
not
as
thick
or
as
dark
as
some
other
milk
stouts
i
have
seen
the
flavor
is
sweet
definitely
some
cocoa
taste
but
not
overly
so
for
the
genre
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
again
was
not
as
heavy
as
many
milk
stouts
but
still
smooth
as
you
would
hope
i
really
liked
it
o
decent
milk
stout
but
lacking
a
bit
in
the
milk
department
it
drinks
like
a
generic
stout
for
the
most
part

here
ive
liked
all
that
ive
tried
from
against
the
grain
so
far
extremely
dark
brown
appears
jet
black
in
the
glass
pours
with
a
huge
tan
head
the
head
dies
down
and
leaves
an
uneven
layer
foam
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
sticky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
sweet
smell
with
scents
of
coffee
and
chocolate
rich
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
coffee
and
malt
and
a
velvety
smooth
finish
on
your
tongue
delicious
medium
body
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
overall
an
excellent
stout
that
i
would
gladly
purchase
again
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
foamy
tight
bubbled
fizzy
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
out
into
an
uneven
surface
coating
aromas
of
coffee
and
cream
were
pouring
out
of
the
glass
as
soon
as
the
beer
hit
it
and
upon
further
inspection
there
is
a
heavy
dose
of
coffee
and
cream
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
milk
chocolate
highlights
and
hints
of
booze
smells
delicious
flavors
are
roast
forward
with
a
heavy
bitter
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
backbone
solid
lacto
overlay
creamy
highlights
and
hints
of
smoke
and
wood
this
is
a
deep
drink
more
layered
than
your
typical
milk
stout
pleasant
and
weighty
the
body
is
full
robust
and
smooth
with
a
dry
undertone
to
remind
you
this
is
still
a
stout
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
roast
and
bitter
but
hints
of
cream
linger
the
finish
is
smooth
clean
and
slightly
dry
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
well
put
together
beer
and
it
tastes
damn
good
at
the
same
time
22

the
beer
pours
dark

with
an
inch
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
molasses
cream
and
dark
fruit
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
but
at
18
99
i
will
never
purchase
again
i
bought
this
over
the
phone
and
had
my
brother
pick
it
when
he
was
at
redstone
liquors
didnt
bother
to
ask
the
abv
when
he
told
me
that
price
once
again
good
but
wanted
to
be
floored
for
that
price

o
very
solid
milk
stout
you
wont
be
disappointing
if
you
can
snag
one
from
a
bottle
shop
poured
dark
brown
almost
black
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
patches
both
roasted
and
milklike
aromas
greet
my
nose
as
i
smell
and
then
same
flavors
greet
my
tongue
as
i
drink
i
found
the
beer
to
be
mediumbodied
smooth
even
silky
with
good
balance
as
the
roasted
malts
are
in
the
background
and
the
beer
has
a
light
not
overpowering
milk
and
milk
chocolate
like
sweetness
with
the
sweetness
being
the
major
taste
sensation
not
to
minimize
the
other
tastes
this
might
not
be
a
beer
for
everyone
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
it
pleased
my
sweet
tooth
o
an
enjoyable
brew
true
to
style
and
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
glass
produced
a
huge
34
fingers
of
an
off
white
khaki
head
smell
up
front
is
smokiness
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
milk
sugar
sweetness
that
usually
accompanies
a
milk
stout
taste
up
front
is
all
smoke
then
it
starts
to
mellow
out
into
a
nice
flavored
classic
milk
stout
mouth
feel
was
silky
smooth
slight
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
this
was
intended
to
be
a
smoked
milk
stout
but
that
s
the
impression
i
get
along
the
lines
of
there
bo
luke
only
creamier
and
not
barrel
aged
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
best
beer
ive
had
from
kentucky
so
far
poured
into
a
reubens
brew
snifter
pours
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
thick
brown
film
and
healthy
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
dark
toasted
malt
lots
of
chocolate
and
light
coffee
hints
of
vanilla
flavor
is
sweet
toasted
malt
with
light
lactose
hot
cocoa
hints
of
charred
coffee
finishes
somewhat
thin
with
pleasant
light
milky
cocoa
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
a
nicely
made
milk
stout
that
starts
out
rich
and
creamy
but
finishes
a
bit
lighter
but
well
balanced
pleasant
aftertaste
of
milky
cocoa
o
compared
to
other
milk
stouts
the
taste
of
this
beer
didnt
seem
to
be
as
sweet
and
have
as
much
flavors
of
lactose
nonetheless
it
is
an
enjoyable
stout
that
has
nice
smoothness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
blend
of
lactose
and
roasted
malt
flavors
pitch
black
with
a
khaki
head
surprising
for
a
beer
this
strength
sweet
dark
chocolate
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
char
the
flavor
is
roasted
dominant
with
burnt
wood
flavors
and
burnt
sugar
a
lot
of
chocolate
in
this
beer
very
dark
and
earthy
dry
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
coffee
a
good
bitteerness
rom
the
dark
chocolate
balances
out
well
drinks
really
easy
and
has
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
awesome
stuff
from
atg
overall
a
really
nice
representative
of
the
style
it
has
all
the
features
one
looks
for
bitter
flavors
from
the
roasted
malt
and
some
nice
creamy
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
hop
character
is
fairly
nonexistent
this
is
about
malt
and
roast
excellent
afterdinner
sipper
on
a
chilly
evening
i
wish
it
came
in
6packs
instead
of
pricey
bombers
this
is
a
spot
on
rendition
of
an
english
milk
stout
whether
thats
your
cup
of
tea
or
not
o
i
consider
this
a
thin
stout
im
not
sure
of
abv
but
its
well
hidden
if
its
high
great
nose
and
taste
very
coffee
forward
and
smoothed
out
with
the
lacto
a
session
stout
overall
above
average
to
good
but
mostly
good
i
would
give
it
a
try
but
it
falls
toward
the
lower
end
of
all
the
milk
stouts
ive
had
lately
i
would
probably
rather
have
a
guinness
and
definitely
a
murphys
still
pretty
good
though
glad
to
see
dave
is
grabbing
some
of
those
atg
kegs
floating
around
out
there
this
one
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
brown
foam
the
nose
comprises
darklyroasted
malts
light
coffee
and
very
light
dark
cocoa
powder
despite
the
seeming
ethereality
of
some
of
those
elements
things
come
across
rather
pleasantly
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
roast
comeing
through
a
bit
milder
the
cocoa
coming
through
more
powerfully
and
a
bit
of
lightlytoasted
oats
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
milk
stout
one
that
atg
somehow
managed
to
not
go
too
crazy
with
allowing
a
tasty
beer
to
shine
on
its
own
good
times
smell
is
sweet
sugary
malts
taste
is
sweet
lacto
malts
not
much
roasted
flavor
but
very
sweet
and
sugar
forward
its
very
sweet
and
a
definite
lacto
flavor
is
obvious
i
like
a
good
sweet
stout
but
this
was
very
sweet
but
i
guess
thats
the
style
its
a
good
sweet
stout
one
is
good
but
its
a
good
one
it
seems
that
im
quick
to
detract
their
more
experimental
beers
because
of
the
unusualness
of
their
creative
spirits
and
the
unsettled
palate
thats
then
created
though
they
didnt
go
against
the
grain
here
i
kinda
miss
the
game
of
whats
new
in
this
glass
perhaps
i
just
need
to
turn
the
brain
off
and
simply
drink
the
damn
beer
delicious
like
chocolate
milk
blended
into
a
milk
stout
not
overly
sweet
though
the
cocoa
and
roasted
barley
add
a
bittering
dryness
to
compliment
this
beers
drinkability
delicious
beer
with
balance
and
consistency
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
tried
it
from
the
can
sweet
creamy
taste
with
loads
of
chocolate
ebf
sample
pour
pours
dark
brown
smell
is
goddamn
chocolate
milk
nails
its
intended
purpose
milk
chocolate
with
some
coffee
and
cream
flavor
is
the
same
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
with
a
strong
of
chocolate
syrup
some
softer
coffee
flavors
coffee
with
a
lot
of
cream
lactose
body
is
light
but
the
feel
is
creamy
executed
very
well
here
4
hands
has
quickly
become
a
brewery
that
caught
my
attention
good
job
again
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
cannot
remember
a
chocolate
beer
that
tasted
so
much
like
chocolate
o
not
a
bad
beer
flavor
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
but
they
got
what
they
were
aiming
for
so
i
cant
flaw
that
but
its
just
a
little
light
for
a
stout
for
me
nice
chocolate
flavors
for
such
a
low
abv
o
great
beer
for
the
chocolate
lover
i
may
buy
this
from
time
to
time
o
good
but
not
great
chocolate
milk
stout
cola
taste
dominates
more
than
the
chocolate
little
bit
thin
and
too
carbonated
from
a
12
oz
can
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
good
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
chocolate
as
one
would
expect
though
not
particularly
strong
upon
sipping
a
delicious
smokiness
surprised
me
because
i
did
not
detect
it
in
the
aroma
a
rich
chocolaty
flavor
with
a
sweet
finish
feels
very
light
and
smooth
for
such
a
dark
beer
not
creamy
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
name
overall
nice
and
refreshing
like
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
easily
sessionable
and
very
enjoyable
pours
deep
black
in
color
with
little
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
tastes
of
it
as
well
not
my
favorite
chocolate
stout
but
very
drinkable
best
chocolate
stout
ive
had
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
alright
brew
after
a
couple
straight
reviews
where
i
kind
of
thrashed
some
4
hands
products
i
have
found
one
i
like
condor
recommended
and
approved
especially
for
the
cold
dark
winter
nights
ahead
taste
exquisitely
smooth
the
lactose
infusion
makes
this
one
sooo
easy
to
drink
and
mellow
chocolate
flavors
all
the
way
here
with
some
roastiness
rounding
out
the
flavor
profile
absolutely
delicious
so
much
so
that
we
grabbed
growlers
to
bring
some
more
home
as
bottles
were
all
sold
out
during
our
visit
very
impressed
true
to
its
name
nice
cocoa
presence
in
this
drinks
easy
the
good
is
taste
taste
and
taste
one
of
the
best
tasting
chocolate
stouts
that
ive
had
its
drinkable
and
the
flavor
doesnt
become
overbearing
or
to
sweet
now
for
the
other
side
its
very
thin
and
carbonated
almost
like
a
chocolate
cola
mouthfeel
is
the
equivalent
of
water
with
that
all
said
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
drink
it
again
4
hands
is
legit
i
enjoy
their
resurrected
ipa
cash
money
imperial
ipa
they
are
starting
to
become
an
exciting
brewery
and
if
they
ever
decide
to
turn
this
into
a
double
chocolate
milk
stout
i
think
it
will
be
a
game
changer
plenty
of
sweet
chocolate
to
be
found
here
and
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
well
weve
gotta
do
something
now
that
weve
left
the
new
bigbys
so
why
not
crack
open
a
chocolate
milk
stout
that
vdubb
tells
me
is
quite
tasty
it
pours
a
straight
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
confirms
the
name
comprising
cocoa
powder
mild
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
sweet
coffee
for
the
everloving
sake
of
it
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
milk
chocolate
character
shining
in
all
its
cocoay
glory
the
body
is
a
litheleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
rather
tasty
stout
one
ill
likely
purchase
several
times
in
the
near
future
get
some
cool
label
thats
about
the
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
frankly
i
dont
even
taste
chocolate
i
taste
and
smell
burnt
espresso
beans
also
kind
of
watery
i
expect
a
stout
to
feeltaste
thick
and
rich
this
one
seems
thin
and
weak
there
is
so
much
potential
for
a
beer
like
this
but
it
seems
this
brewery
and
many
others
like
it
are
just
trying
to
ride
the
profit
wave
with
uninspiring
products
too
bad
i
suppose
theres
a
chance
it
somehow
became
skunked
bottled
on
32514
pours
brown
with
some
clarity
tan
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
features
heavy
milk
chocolate
and
roast
smells
like
a
decadent
candy
bar
kind
of
reminds
me
of
southern
tiers
choklat
taste
is
not
as
flavorful
and
full
of
chocolate
as
the
nose
promises
plenty
of
roast
present
mild
bitterness
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
nose
is
great
the
flavor
isnt
bad
just
falls
short
of
what
i
was
hoping
for
based
on
the
aroma
overall
good
beer
and
well
balanced
for
sure
a
little
light
on
the
palate
maybe
but
drinks
easily
the
nose
was
perhaps
somewhat
more
impressive
than
the
taste
was
but
this
is
still
a
solid
sweet
stout
and
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
for
the
box
totoropanda
very
smooth
as
a
milk
stout
with
a
mild
chocolate
flavor
i
tasted
a
very
slight
coffee
undercurrent
which
many
like
in
a
stout
but
me
not
so
much
not
real
strong
but
enough
to
knock
my
rating
down
a
half
step
as
reference
my
favorite
of
the
chocolate
stouts
is
definitely
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
black
in
color
with
no
light
penetrating
this
brew
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
i
smell
lactosechocolate
and
dark
malt
the
flavor
is
bitter
dark
malt
in
the
front
of
the
palate
theres
a
restrained
amount
of
chocolate
and
lactose
present
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
solid
sweet
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
cant
wait
to
try
it
at
the
brewery
next
week
overall
wish
that
this
beer
tasted
like
it
smells
its
a
good
milk
stout
but
a
better
flavor
profile
and
a
thicker
mouthfeel
will
make
this
beer
very
desirable
and
make
it
a
beer
at
the
top
of
its
style
overall
not
bad
lots
of
great
chocolate
and
cookie
dough
nice
cocoa
and
lactose
milk
chocolate
even
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
too
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
thanks
matt
overall
a
really
good
chocolate
stout
enough
chocolate
to
know
it
is
there
nice
roasted
malt
character
as
others
have
noted
the
carbonation
takes
it
down
a
notch
great
creamy
chocolate
flavor
and
aroma
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
chocolate
stout
not
too
subtle
at
all
this
is
a
great
balance
of
malts
and
chocolate
with
the
mouthfeel
was
not
as
sharp
as
it
was
more
of
a
hindrance
than
anything
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
good
chocolate
flavor
that
is
not
overly
sweet
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
pinch
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
a
very
good
very
smooth
stout
that
would
make
an
absolutely
fantastic
dessert
beer
i
would
like
to
have
a
bit
more
roasted
grain
coffee
taste
to
compliment
the
chocolate
and
lactose
but
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
characterize
this
as
a
stout
since
it
doesnt
really
have
any
of
the
flavors
i
normally
associate
with
a
stout
but
4
hands
brewing
is
definitely
on
my
brewers
to
watch
list
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
with
copious
amounts
of
chocolate
it
could
stand
to
have
a
smoother
mouthfeel
but
tasty
none
the
less
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
chocolate
stouts
out
there
goose
islands
big
john
is
the
only
other
chocolate
stout
that
is
comparable
to
this
one
as
i
said
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
they
were
not
met
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
a
particularly
good
one
overall
nice
chocolate
maybe
i
had
this
beer
too
late
in
the
tasting
but
i
dont
get
a
lot
else
out
of
it
has
a
nice
body
for
the
low
abv
creamy
but
clean
nice
chocolate
flavors
not
too
sweet
with
a
nice
balance
quite
enjoyable

nothing
impressive
about
this
one
as
i
said
above
its
not
terrible
but
im
not
loving
it
o
eh
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
in
the
end
it
taste
like
a
brown
ale
with
cacao
nibs
added
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
especially
four
the
price
thanks
to
mark
kathy
for
this
one
o
this
is
a
really
delicious
beer
i
cant
say
enough
about
how
much
every
4
hands
beer
impressed
me
keep
em
coming
decent
overall
good
stout
easy
to
drink
overall
very
good
brew
imo
there
is
a
nice
milk
stout
backbone
to
this
brew
dark
malt
sweetness
and
richness
with
some
coffee
comes
in
then
the
nice
coca
nib
notes
are
present
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
yet
extremely
flavorful

overall
awesome
will
revisit
pdubs
is
the
real
deal
brewery
right
here
in
chicago
find
it
drink
it
a
very
good
beer
but
a
bit
strong
and
oily
for
my
personal
taste
still
very
tasty
though
lots
of
flavor
and
body
and
the
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
i
just
prefer
the
58
range
loved
this
batch
545546
creamy
rich
and
smooth
verdict
a
simple
but
balanced
and
enjoyable
stout
from
pipeworks
the
abv
is
hidden
well
and
for
a
bigger
beer
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
but
it
almost
works
against
itself
as
nothing
really
leaps
out
off
the
tongue
definitely
a
nice
stout
for
the
cold
weather
o
another
great
pipeworks
brew
tasty
and
slightly
sweet
o
pipeworks
continues
to
impress
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
m
really
smooth
oily
and
creamy
real
appealing
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
really
well
a
bit
sweet
but
expected
with
a
milk
stout
mediumfull
body
o
a
damn
good
stout
for
the
chocolate
lovers
in
the
stout
fan
base
overall
better
than
jones
dog
but
mostly
because
of
all
the
chocolate
in
it
o
this
beer
is
amazing
i
have
two
downstairs
in
my
cellar
and
i
am
thinking
about
going
back
to
get
more
because
i
want
more
for
now
taste
is
also
sweet
with
chocolate
up
front
and
some
coffee
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
lingering
roastiness
ok
carbonation
though
it
feels
a
little
thin
pretty
drinkable
i
liked
imperial
hyper
dog
better
but
this
was
pretty
good
overall
milk
stouts
have
never
been
a
favorite
of
mine
but
pipeworks
does
them
well
this
one
is
sweet
almost
too
much
so
but
drinks
well
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
of
the
dog
series
in
my
opinion
great
chocolate
complexity
offering
both
creamy
and
bittersweet
chocolate
aromas
and
flavors
this
is
another
really
solid
offering
from
pipeworks
it
has
a
really
smooth
milk
chocolate
taste
with
a
good
malty
body
i
like
the
deep
dark
coloring
and
it
has
a
sweet
vanilla
nose
on
it
plus
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
label
art
and
love
that
they
incorporated
game
of
thrones
like
this
really
well
done
its
a
big
sweet
stout
thats
drinkable
and
packed
with
dessert
like
flavors
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
o
very
tasty
milk
stout
from
pipeworks
ive
not
had
many
in
this
style
but
its
among
the
best
i
have
had
on
any
given
sip
the
10
is
hardly
detectable
but
it
accumulates
very
nicely
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
only
quibble
is
i
wish
the
vanilla
was
more
prominent
nicely
done
pipeworks
game
of
jones
45
o
overall
a
pretty
good
sweet
stout
that
would
make
a
damn
fine
dessert
beer
poured
into
upland
snifter
pours
a
deep
brownish
black
with
medium
visual
weight
dark
brown
head
forms
upon
pour
and
retains
a
thin
layer
no
lacing
present
the
nose
is
cacao
forward
with
a
strong
influence
from
the
lactose
sugar
presenting
a
bit
of
cream
vanilla
comes
in
at
the
finish
and
is
paired
with
a
helping
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
very
chocolatey
up
front
with
roastiness
picking
up
in
intensity
with
each
sip
the
roast
provides
a
little
bitterness
but
it
quickly
rounded
out
by
vanilla
and
cream
there
is
a
slight
boozy
presence
at
the
very
end
which
will
inevitably
mellow
out
once
this
beer
has
had
a
few
months
on
it
mouthfeel
is
hearty
with
moderate
carbonation
another
tasty
brew
from
pipeworks
incredibly
smooth
and
delicious
this
beer
doesnt
even
hint
at
the
fact
that
its
double
digit
abv
great
chocolatey
taste
pleasant
aroma
i
plan
on
picking
up
an
extra
bottle
for
the
cellar
posthaste
i
might
be
presumptuous
in
saying
this
right
now
but
i
believe
this
is
the
best
of
the
stouts
pipeworks
has
made
enjoyed
them
more
this
time
around
i
love
white
russians
and
this
certainly
does
not
stand
up
to
the
name
but
is
definitely
unique
and
very
smooth
not
as
good
as
i
remember
as
good
as
the
movie
does
not
taste
like
a
white
russian
too
much
banana
ester
and
cloying
belgian
sweetness
light
for
a
stout
but
delicious
excellent
flavor
of
vanilla
and
coffee
with
a
creamy
texture
sweet
and
satisfying
points
for
originality
in
terms
of
appearance
but
i
didnt
get
any
cacao
or
vanilla
just
a
lingering
sweetness
this
reminds
me
of
an
iced
vanilla
latte
sweet
with
a
cloying
quality
to
it
this
is
the
only
white
stout
i
have
had
and
at
first
the
appearance
does
take
you
aback
if
you
like
milk
stouts
then
this
is
a
must
try
if
only
for
the
curiosity
level
m
creamy
and
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
yeah
jonnycakes
should
be
here
for
a
stout
flavored
after
his
favorite
mixed
drink
but
vdubb
will
do
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
faded
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
hazelnut
liquor
light
heavy
cream
heh
i
made
a
funny
and
a
touch
of
caramelized
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
that
odd
disoronno
flavor
really
confusing
me
shouldnt
there
be
some
sort
of
coffee
flavor
here
or
maybe
more
roast
dammit
pipeworks
i
love
you
guys
but
you
really
confuse
me
sometimes
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
not
a
bad
stout
really
but
the
attempt
at
recreating
white
russian
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
work
out
for
me
leading
instead
to
some
strange
hazelnut
marzipanlike
nonsense
and
a
nearly
complete
disregard
for
stoutness
but
thats
just
like
my
opinion
man
t
definitely
better
than
the
smell
chocolate
milk
right
away
with
a
lot
of
cream
vanilla
custard
and
light
roast
coffee
a
touch
of
burnt
coffee
grounds
and
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
a
pretty
difficult
task
to
take
on
but
i
think
they
did
pretty
well
with
this
glad
i
got
to
try
this
a
white
russian
imperial
stout
sign
me
up
poured
into
snifter
step
one
is
beer
light
in
color
check
appears
a
moderate
copper
tone
with
nice
clarity
ring
of
white
head
forms
and
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
by
far
the
lightest
colored
stout
ive
witnessed
step
two
does
it
smell
like
a
stout
check
notes
of
caramel
cacao
cream
coffee
and
vanilla
all
come
through
notes
of
burnt
sugar
linger
throughout
not
getting
the
depth
of
roast
that
i
would
expect
in
an
imperial
stout
but
the
combo
of
vanilla
coffee
and
cacao
imply
sweet
stout
alright
step
3
does
it
taste
like
a
stout
check
ish
up
front
i
get
notes
of
coffee
and
cacao
which
give
you
the
implication
that
you
are
drinking
a
stout
this
is
quickly
taken
over
by
a
heavy
sweetness
cream
vanilla
and
caramel
dominate
through
the
end
of
the
palate
the
finish
is
incredibly
sweet
almost
too
sweet
for
my
enjoyment
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
step
4
does
it
feel
like
a
stout
not
so
much
while
this
is
no
light
bodied
beer
it
just
doesnt
take
on
the
viscosity
that
i
love
so
much
in
big
stouts
carbonation
is
spot
on
mild
to
moderate
overall
this
is
a
fun
beer
while
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
for
repeated
tries
it
was
worth
the
experience
i
dig
the
big
lebowski
reference
and
i
love
the
ambition
of
pipeworks
o
overall
this
was
a
fun
beer
guess
its
harder
to
nail
this
profile
than
i
thought
all
the
elements
are
there
just
wish
they
were
in
different
degrees
still
not
a
bad
beer
and
quite
drinkable
great
beer
though
o
i
get
it
but
i
dont
get
it
this
beer
is
more
weird
for
the
sake
of
being
weird
than
weird
in
a
good
way
i
dont
regret
having
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
pipeworks
hey
careful
man
theres
a
beverage
here
45
overall
pretty
good
all
the
flavors
combine
to
a
nice
white
russian
like
flavor
although
the
coffee
was
a
bit
too
strong
but
tasty
the
oats
and
lactose
made
a
nice
creamy
cream
feel
coffee
and
cocoa
nibs
for
the
kahlua
and
overall
beer
was
a
nice
big
flavorful
drink
that
was
enjoyable
and
even
the
beer
blended
in
nicely
a
noble
experiment
that
indeed
has
echoes
of
the
infamous
white
russian
which
i
was
too
poor
to
drink
when
i
wanted
to
drink
that
kind
of
thing
but
ultimately
this
is
a
scalding
mess
of
a
beer
still
interesting
pretty
good
certainly
worth
sampling
o
well
if
the
bottle
didnt
explicitly
say
it
id
say
this
beer
doesnt
know
what
its
trying
to
be
i
have
a
hard
time
comprehending
it
as
a
milk
stout
and
even
harder
time
trying
to
comprehend
it
as
anything
approaching
a
white
russian
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
dont
feel
like
theyve
replicated
mimicked
or
given
tribute
to
the
white
russian
and
i
can
say
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
8
year
olds
dude
deep
amberburgundy
color
with
no
head
at
all
and
minimal
bubbles
you
can
pick
up
the
vanilla
coffee
and
booze
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
somewhere
between
a
boozy
stout
and
barleywine
very
different
and
interesting
blonde
stout
it
certainly
hits
on
the
flavors
present
in
a
white
russian
and
the
booze
is
very
upfront
nice
warming
winter
beer
very
inventive
and
interesting
beer
thats
worth
a
try
but
not
quite
something
i
need
a
lot
more
of
quite
a
perplexing
beer
to
review
nothing
is
conventional
for
the
style
but
makes
sense
with
what
theyre
going
for
the
components
are
lackluster
individually
but
a
fun
beer
as
a
whole
this
dude
abides
overall
this
was
great
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
a
white
ris
super
rich
brew
but
better
then
the
dog
series
in
my
opinion
extra
kudos
on
creativity
just
another
great
beer
by
pdubs
and
one
people
should
try
if
youre
looking
for
these
experimental
stouts
overall
pipeworks
seems
to
love
these
additive
heavy
stouts
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
so
far
every
drink
seems
to
bring
out
different
accents
of
this
brew
love
the
coffee
and
cacao
aspects
with
everything
being
a
great
supplementary
player
had
to
get
this
one
not
only
due
to
pipeworks
genius
and
creativity
but
im
a
huge
big
lebowski
fan
wish
i
could
be
bowling
right
now
with
walter
donnie
and
the
dude
dark
black
with
a
thin
dark
brown
head
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
complex
with
a
strong
vanilla
and
oak
character
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
taste
was
semisweet
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
coffee
followed
by
a
strong
vanilla
wave
concluding
in
an
oaky
alcohol
burn
a
little
bit
thin
for
a
13
stout
but
the
taste
definitely
lingers
and
coats
the
tongue
this
definitely
lived
up
to
its
billing
an
outstanding
barrel
aged
stout
damn
glad
i
was
able
to
get
it
at
an
independent
store
as
the
big
box
chain
in
the
area
didnt
have
it
when
i
called
at
2
but
somehow
got
it
and
sold
out
by
315
the
same
afternoon
pours
dark
mahoganyalmost
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
good
retention
and
minor
amounts
of
lace
aroma
is
sweet
rye
whiskey
chocolate
molasses
and
vanilla
flavor
follows
aroma
a
lot
of
whiskey
chocolate
and
vanilla
some
sweetness
on
the
back
end
but
finishes
dry
and
boozy
very
well
balanced
absolutely
phenomenal
mellow
carbonation
mediumbodied
with
some
heat
and
dryness
on
the
finish
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
and
as
it
warms
im
thinking
i
may
have
rated
it
a
bit
low
this
is
an
excellent
barrel
aged
chocolate
stout
pours
dark
with
a
good
light
touch
of
carbonation
upon
opening
a
wave
of
bourbon
from
the
buffalo
trace
barrels
hits
you
with
a
huge
boozy
aroma
this
is
a
beer
to
serve
at
room
temperature
where
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
notes
can
be
felt
the
best
outstanding
and
worth
every
penny
o
i
went
into
this
with
low
expectations
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
was
sipping
this
i
saw
that
it
won
an
award
at
fobab
so
thats
cool
too
hopefully
my
next
pdubs
experience
will
be
like
this
one
batch
209
o
very
nice
offering
from
pipeworks
this
is
certainly
a
very
good
but
not
quite
excellent
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
4
thin
black
pour
with
little
head
aroma
is
all
bourbon
most
whiskey
smelling
beers
ive
ever
smelled
taste
is
milky
chocolate
with
a
lot
of
bourbon
very
good
but
very
strong
o
outstanding
ba
stout
this
is
perfect
for
a
late
summer
sunday
afternoon
watching
football
only
wish
i
was
able
to
get
more
than
one
take
jones
dog
to
the
promised
land
o
quite
delicious
wish
i
had
one
to
age
because
it
wouldve
mellowed
out
a
little
and
blended
everything
together
perfect
amount
of
time
in
the
barrels
well
done
mouthfeel
is
really
rich
and
creamy
a
nice
sipping
beer
completely
costs
the
mouth
with
sticky
sweet
goodness
verdict
an
absolute
stunner
from
pipeworks
a
textbook
example
of
improving
upon
a
base
beer
using
barrels
adds
not
only
complexity
but
depth
the
balance
of
flavors
is
wonderful
everything
in
harmony
both
sweet
and
earthy
this
is
easily
my
favorite
pipeworks
beer
to
date
and
a
remarkably
good
stout
really
awesome
pipeworks
brew
not
suprising
as
the
regular
games
of
jones
is
so
good
tastes
like
a
good
barrel
aged
beer
but
with
some
sweet
chocolate
flavor
unique
barrel
aged
offering
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
i
love
that
the
bourbon
characteristics
in
this
brew
are
so
familiar
to
actually
drinking
buffalo
trace
a
definite
alcohol
sting
with
perfect
accents
of
cherries
and
oak
are
all
too
familiar
i
love
a
big
barrel
character
which
this
brew
brings
yet
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
tones
come
through
very
clearly
as
well
awesome
overall
glad
the
bottle
was
free
just
another
mediocre
overpriced
beer
from
these
guys
taste
has
more
nuance
though
still
plenty
of
whiskey
heat
packed
in
woody
drying
aftertaste
much
like
a
sip
of
bourbon
middle
has
notes
of
earthy
roasted
malt
toffee
caramel
toasted
almond
dry
tobacco
leaves
chewy
and
rich
but
not
without
some
sting
and
numbing
alcohol
overall
a
little
more
balance
would
be
nice
though
it
tastes
good
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
nearly
no
head
the
nose
is
spirit
forward
with
huge
oak
and
char
notes
paired
with
strong
vanilla
next
comes
some
fudgy
brownie
notes
that
pair
nicely
with
he
barrel
notes
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
heavy
vanilla
notes
paired
with
fudge
and
cocoa
the
barrel
aging
has
really
smoothed
the
base
out
and
has
intensified
the
chocolate
notes
my
only
slight
issue
with
the
beer
is
the
body
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
big
flavors
the
flavors
are
there
no
doubt
but
it
is
just
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
i
like
where
things
are
going
for
pipeworks
will
be
excited
to
see
what
other
barrel
aged
brews
are
on
the
horizon
o
a
very
good
version
of
this
beer
also
had
this
at
fobab
and
its
even
better
than
i
remember
please
let
this
one
warm
up
its
worth
it
batch
209
fresh
from
the
oak
this
is
very
barrel
forward
with
tons
of
whiskey
and
in
every
way
fantastic
pours
very
dark
with
a
light
frothy
head
looks
kind
of
like
a
glass
of
cola
on
the
nose
is
pungent
alcohol
bakers
chocolate
and
notable
sweetness
taste
is
rich
and
intense
bourbonsoaked
raisins
and
dates
creamy
chocolate
and
lots
of
burnt
brown
sugar
but
the
barrel
character
tends
to
overwhelm
those
more
subtle
flavors
its
a
milk
stout
so
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
but
not
too
thin
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
overall
this
one
suffers
from
the
overpowering
barrel
character
and
all
the
flavors
of
the
original
jones
dog
get
snuffed
out
rather
than
enhanced
well
done
dispute
the
price
tag
im
glad
its
a
12oz
serving
its
quite
filling
but
delicious
overall
if
you
like
bourbondominated
beers
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
to
taste
the
beer
back
there
this
is
not
for
you
i
happen
to
really
like
bourbon
although
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
drink
it
straight
over
this
i
came
back
to
this
beer
had
to
updateedit
my
review
this
beer
is
perfect
this
stands
just
as
tall
as
bcbs
if
you
miss
out
on
this
beer
its
a
shame
because
this
is
amazing

o
really
impressed
with
this
one
if
you
love
big
bourbon
characteristics
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
really
impressed
with
pipe
works
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
has
been
amazing
total
4150
pours
with
a
visible
viscosity
looks
flat
only
the
tiniest
bit
of
light
tan
colored
head
very
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
sweet
syrupy
bourbon
taste
is
more
of
the
same
very
sweet
and
very
chocolatey
bourbon
and
barrel
are
there
too
but
the
sweetness
takes
center
stage
full
bodied
and
viscous
very
low
carbonation
creamy
smooth
it
was
very
sweet
but
had
a
really
big
kick
on
the
back
end
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
hot
but
you
could
get
a
good
sense
of
the
whiskey
influence
in
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
very
well
done
and
would
love
another
opportunity
to
try
this
one
chocolate
milkshake
with
a
bitter
coffee
finish
overall
pretty
solid
milk
stout
would
be
nice
to
try
this
out
on
nitro
that
would
be
awesome
great
milk
stout
another
great
beer
from
tree
house
so
bold
and
full
flavored
great
pour
and
rich
taste
pours
a
very
dark
brown
thats
settles
with
a
black
body
and
a
frothy
mocha
colored
head
aroma
is
roasted
malts
milk
chocolate
sugary
vanilla
and
a
dash
of
coffee
taste
includes
flavors
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
and
hints
of
bitter
coffee
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
frothy
with
a
medium
body
very
good
example
of
the
style
with
pronounced
flavors
for
a
5
6
abv
beer
well
done
my
first
taste
of
tree
house
beer
a
delicious
milk
stout
a
surprisingly
full
mouthfeel
for
such
a
low
abv
stout
overall
really
good
milk
stout
with
a
surprising
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
flavors
but
which
are
balanced
nicely
by
subtle
vanilla
and
chocolate
well
worth
picking
up
when
at
treehouse
brewery
i
am
sucker
for
left
hands
milk
stout
and
pretty
much
use
that
to
gauge
the
style
this
is
definitely
the
best
local
example
of
milk
stout
i
have
had
and
perhaps
second
best
to
left
hand
so
far
for
me
that
doesnt
count
beers
like
life
is
like
and
xocoveza
because
those
are
pretty
much
imperial
stouts
with
some
lactose
thats
what
she
said
is
an
amazingly
tasty
and
immensely
quaffable
milk
stout
leave
it
to
the
folks
at
tree
house
to
take
a
typically
pedestrian
style
and
make
it
awesome
i
prefer
a
more
standard
not
sweet
or
milk
stout
but
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
here
its
a
meal
with
a
gorgeous
head
no
complaints
quality
stuff
as
far
as
a
milk
stout
goes
this
is
near
the
top
certainly
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
o
overall
not
a
bad
milk
stout
nice
lactose
and
chocolate
notes
easy
drinking
would
be
a
fine
stout
to
drink
in
the
warmer
months
pours
black
with
dark
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
soft
khaki
head
its
a
thick
blanket
of
small
bubbles
great
lacing
good
head
retention
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
with
some
gentle
roast
nice
lactic
edge
loads
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
its
medium
sweet
with
lots
of
cocoa
flavor
the
relatively
mild
lactic
note
keeps
the
beer
from
getting
cloying
plus
there
is
very
little
of
the
cola
flavor
that
i
tend
to
find
a
bit
overbearing
in
other
examples
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
gentle
they
filled
this
growler
right
up
to
the
top
leaving
nearly
zero
head
space
and
the
beer
kept
very
well
pretty
much
perfect
for
the
style
very
impressive
stuff
im
not
the
biggest
milk
stout
fan
but
this
is
just
how
i
like
them
the
taste
is
big
on
the
coffee
almost
like
a
cafe
au
lait
mmmm
poured
from
a
750ml
growler
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
highlighted
blackish
color
with
a
frothy
light
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
chunky
sparse
surface
coating
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffee
sweet
caramel
smoke
dark
chocolate
a
touch
of
charcampfire
and
a
hint
of
cream
smells
like
a
bitter
robust
rich
beer
flavors
are
cream
forward
quickly
underscored
by
a
bitter
roast
coffee
character
chocolate
and
caramel
blend
in
the
backbone
to
sweeten
the
brew
a
bit
further
but
the
scales
still
tip
to
bitter
and
smoky
this
is
a
campfire
beer
and
a
very
drinkable
one
at
that
tasty
light
smooth
body
that
is
slightly
dry
to
remain
within
the
style
parameters
the
aftertaste
is
cream
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
the
campfire
smoke
still
present
slick
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
solid
drinkable
beer
excellently
crafted
i
love
this
beer
and
will
drive
the
hour
from
boston
again
soon
o
this
is
the
essence
of
a
milk
stout
outta
bounds
so
delicious
everything
that
you
want
is
there
and
more
great
name
for
the
beer
too
tree
house
stop
it
this
is
the
style
nailed
i
had
this
again
after
a
long
while
wow
i
dare
you
to
name
me
a
better
milk
stout
o
all
in
all
nice
light
flavors
as
expected
from
a
lower
abv
brew
but
lots
of
flavors
bouncing
around
each
balanced
very
well
great
introduction
to
this
new
brewery
o
its
a
pretty
classic
milk
stout
solid
enough
but
a
few
minor
tweaks
would
go
a
long
way
to
enhance
the
drinkability
stiffer
carbontaion
would
provide
the
lift
that
the
body
needs
overall
pretty
nice
very
creamy
lactose
a
bit
of
choccocoa
decent
malt
profile
nice
light
but
noticeable
hops
tasty
and
very
drinkable
drank
while
my
wife
brews
her
first
all
grain
batch
a
well
made
milk
stout
with
a
unique
spin
highlighting
roastcoffee
over
top
of
the
lactose
sugar
this
works
really
well
and
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
popular
o
i
really
wish
i
bought
to
growlers
of
this
stuff
as
the
750ml
was
definitely
not
enough
this
was
very
tasty
and
had
an
extremely
nice
balance
to
it
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
glasses
of
this
and
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
local
ma
beers
being
produced
i
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
as
well
as
other
beers
from
tree
house
taste
follows
the
nose
coffee
and
sweet

closes
lightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is

and
drinkability
is
easy
another
good
one
from
tree

one
of
my
favorite
stouts
as
of
today
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
thin
caramel
head
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
more
thanmedium
thickness
o
nice
punch
of
alcohol
and
chocolaty
sweetness
in
this
you
will
definitely
taste
the
abv
and
it
lingers
once
done
but
the
sweetness
really
balances
it
nice
job
tasty
brew
pours
a

the
style
of
a

mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average

there
is
also
a
noticeable
bitterness

the
roasted

tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hops
hint
of
yeast
chocolate
hint
of
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
a
complex
beer
a
little
too
much
hops
for
my
taste
but
good
chocolate
flavors
though
o
milk
stouts
have
never
been
my
favorite
due
to
the
souring
lactose
this
one
is
quite
sweet
but
its
not
too
bad
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
tried
check
it
out
overall
pretty
decent
milk
stout
but
not
something
to
drink
in
quantity
as
it
becomes
a
chocolate
overdose
after
a
while
o
brashs
smoglifer
drew
me
in
with
its
incredible
label
that
features
a
crypicyetcartoonish
comic
bookstyle
illustration
that
suits
the
beer
quite
well
pouring
inky
black
and
foreboding
this
chocolaterich
aromatic
beer
is
enticing
but
its
robust
bitter
malt
flavor
leans
a
little
too
bitter
and
harshfinishing
for
my
taste
i
enjoy
the
complexities
of
smoglifters
combination
of
styles
if
you
will
but
in
the
end
theres
a
fine
line
i
teeter
on
and
the
lack
of
sweetness
throws
me
off
from
really
getting
into
this
beer
served
in
a

additions
a
really
great
beer
as
a
whole
it
gets
a
bit
cloying
sweet
be
sure
to
share
with
fellow
beergeeks
four
to
eight
ounces
is
enough
for
me
22
ounces
is
unbearable
mouthfeel
mellows
out
a
bit
just
a
touch
of
booze
notes
going
on
with
full
bodied
malts
even
flowing
carbonation
going
on
down
through
each
sip
overall
its
a
nice
beer
big
chocolate
malts
enough
sweetness
to
induce
diabetes
disperse
this
amongst
friends
super
strong
stout
with
some
amazing
flavors
looked
great
with
a
black
as
ink
pour
with
a
nice
brown
head
the
smell
was
amazing
with
hints
of
heavy
cream
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
the
taste
was
full
of
malt
with
the
chocolate
and
milk
flavors
coming
near
the
end
for
a
semi
sweet
finish
the
beer
was
noticeably
strong
drank
at
room
temp
and
very
thick
love
this
kind
of
super
dark
beer
othis
beer
has
a
an
outstanding
taste
and
aroma
o
definitely
lifts
the
smog
with
a
coffee
alertness
that
kept
me
awake
during
the
really
bad
travolta
scenes
in
battlefield
earth
at
least
the
beer
was
good
well
well
i
have
to
admit
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
am
theres
a
lot
of
depth
and
flavor
profiles
that
i
really
enjoy
in
stouts
im
a
milk
stout
guy
but
often
they
become
too
sweet
not
here
the
roast
rules
the
roost
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
o
disappointing
for
the
price
a
study
in
viscosity
and
not
much
else
i
will
not
purchase
this
again
i
got
a
single
pour
not
an
entire
bomber
so
im
happy
with
my
portion
22

that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
milk
stout
all
around
great
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
cream
and
cocoa
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
example
of
an
imperial
milk
stout
which
is
what
brash
claims
it
is
on
the
label
its
very
similar
to
a
well
done
milk
stout
but
all
the
expects
are
bigger
then
they
would
normally
be
and
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
of
showing
what
an
imperial
milk
stout
is
all
about
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
creamy
a
little
rich
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
a
full
bomber
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
so
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
and
it
made
for
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
night
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
all
the
aspects
of
this
beer
were
kicked
up
to
make
it
pretty
fitting
as
an
imperial
milk
stout
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
an
imperial
milk
stout
my
buddy
said
it
was
a
little
pricey
so
i
dont
think
i
would
get
it
often
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
milk
stouts
or
big
stouts
in
general
it
seems
to
fit
pretty
well
in
those
categories
and
i
think
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
impressed
with
this
beer
and
it
made
for
a
pretty
good
first
impression
for
brash
brewing
company
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
and
would
expect
out
of
a
good
imperial
milk
stout
and
i
thought
it
delivered
in
all
aspects
with
no
weak
points
this
may
be
the
best
imperial
milk
stout
i
have
had
great
job
guys
you
can
be
sure
that
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
of
your
beers
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
roasty
characteristics
overall
a
good
not
great
sweet
stout
with
just
enough
char
to
offset
the
sweetness
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
would
not
rush
out
for
it
sure
theres
some
evident
sweetness
to
this
brute
but
the
overall
flavor
character
brings
way
more
to
the
table
bold
and
delightful
overall
very
nice
take
on
an
imp
stout
according
to
brash
drinkin
this
is
like
making
love
to
your
mouth
like
a
horny
sorority
girl
thankfully
that
aint
true
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
ohhh
taste
is
nice
not
overly
sweet
or
rich
but
has
a
nice
roasty
presence
most
milk
stouts
lack
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
well
done
the
booze
kills
this
beer
for
me
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
well
at
all
o
a
very
straightforward
but
enjoyable
milk
stout
from
a
brewery
that
im
starting
to
warm
up
on
makes
me
want
to
buy
hot
fuzz
next
not
as
much
lactose
character
that
id
expect
from
an
imperial
chocolate
milk
stout
tastes
rather
average
for
what
it
is
save
yourself
some
money
and
buy
some
old
rasputin
medium
heavy
body
nicely
carbonated
creamy
holds
together
well
im
really
enjoying
this
one
a
nice
presentation
of
bitternesssweetnesschocolatecoffeetart
the
bitterness
lingers
and
the
finish
is
clean
enough
to
keep
on
sipping
the
label
is
interesting
are
we
to
take
this
beer
with
us
into
the
breach
the
zone
the
quarantined
radioactive
nomansland
so
that
it
will
give
us
life
and
the
power
to
believe
this
beer
had
all
the
makings
for
a
great
beer
but
it
was
far
too
heavy
and
by
after
a
fourth
of
the
beer
i
was
over
it
if
it
wasnt
too
thick
this
beer
would
of
been
amazing
frankly
i
was
very
disappointed
by
it
i
still
have
faith
in
brash
though
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
almost
black
coloring
with
chestnut
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
frothy
dense
half
inch
chocolate
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
tasty
looking
brew
that
pours
rich
and
smooth
aromas
of
coffee
and
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
with
some
hints
of
booze
and
earthy
highlights
flavors
are
rich
roasted
and
super
smooth
wow
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
creamy
backbone
balancing
both
rich
sweetness
and
bitter
notes
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
doing
a
good
job
to
blend
robust
flavors
with
a
kick
of
booze
the
beer
is
smooth
creamy
and
rich
in
mouth
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
palate
drying
slightly
the
finish
is
rich
sweet
and
roasty
but
avoids
cloying
with
the
subtle
bitter
dryness
very
tasty
very
quaffable
brew
a
rich
stout
very
boozy
but
enjoyable
i
didnt
think
the
alcohol
was
too
intrusive
it
seemed
to
enhance
the
taste
i
continue
to
enjoy
the
various
offerings
from
this
relatively
new
contract
brewer
they
have
nice
takes
on
classic
styles
in
bold
flavorful
brews
this
is
a
great
imperial
milk
stout
with
pleasent
notes
of
cocoa
well
worth
a
shot
for
fans
of
the
style
this
is
really
a
tremendous
big
stout
and
nice
to
see
a
different
angle
on
the
usual
ris
and
strong
stouts
the
alcohol
seems
perfectly
integrated
one
of
the
best
stouts
ever
on
my
list
from
the
750
ml
belgianstyle
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
o
excellent
a
very
solid
brew
this
is
my
first
sweet
stout
and
i
am
impressed
the
only
quandary
is
that
smell
that
reminds
me
of
roast
chicken
big
boozy
smooth

at
the

the

inviting
way
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
taste
is
on
point
you
know
youre
drinking
a
big
bad
high
alcohol
beer
but
semi
sweet
chocolate
sugar
and
roasted
malts
still
come
through
and
they
smooth
out
the
initial
harshness
overall
very
well
done
and
something
i
would
pick
up
again
o
usually
i
avoid
milk
stouts
but
an
imperial
milk
stout
like
this
delivers
pours
a
dark
as
night
black
hue
with
a
khaki
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
slowly
recedes
to
look
like
a
cake
gone
wrong
with
dimples
everywhere
and
lacing
everywhere

has
beenthe
smell
is
boozedark
chocolatea
touch
of
vanilla
and
tobaccothe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
and
the
taste
is
definitely
dominated
by
the
dark
chocolate
it
really
is
big
but
i
still
get
some
vanillahazelnut
and
oak
and
as
it
warms
some
booze
and
dark
fruits
aswell
and
overall
its
definitely
a
choc
sweet
stout
but
id
like
to
see
this
with
less
chocolate
as
it
dominates
abit
too
much
for
me
cheers
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
with
some
visible
carbonation
from
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
and
malt
with
some
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
breadiness
and
roastiness
of
the
malt
is
more
forward
in
the
flavor
than
it
is
in
the
aroma
it
blends
well
with
the
milk
chocolate
in
the
flavor
theres
some
nice
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
flavor
but
its
not
overwhelmingly
boozy
the
body
is
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
leaves
a
nice
roasty
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
but
it
aids
the
drinkability
of
this
big
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
needs
a
creamier
mouthfeel
o
nothing
overly
sweet
about
this
one
just
enough
sweetness
to
satisfy
a
sweet
tooth
but
never
gets
cloying
packs
quite
the
punch
at
10
too
a
little
pricey
at
8
99
a
bomber
but
if
you
like
milk
stouts
with
a
good
bit
of
cocoa
without
the
cloying
sweetness
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
you
delivers
successfully
on
its
premise
an
imperial
chocolate
milk
stout
and
it
is
all
there
recommended
and
i
will
seek
more
from
this
brewer
t
thick
chewy
and
loaded
with
dark
flavor
lots
of
roasted
malt
upfront
laced
with
bitter
chocolate
flavor
theres
a
hint
of
sweetness
here
and
there
but
it
seems
to
be
held
back
by
a
lot
of
roasted
bitterness
some
anise
and
charred
wood
before
a
finish
of
cinnamon
and
more
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slightly
creamy
but
i
would
definitely
like
a
bit
more
creaminess
from
a
chocolate
milk
stout
still
this
is
good
stuff
at
tjs
everyday
today
decided
to
try
something
new
going
with
the
brash
smoglifter
it
had
everything
going
for
it
looks
nose
taste
this
was
easily
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
i
ever
had
tjs
listed
it
as
an
imperial
milk
chocolate
stout
i
tend
to
let
this
style
warm
up
but
even
cold
out
of
the
tap
this
demonstrated
a
fine
palate
pleasing
profile
poured
a
blackish
body
with
decent
head
that
died
quick
with
no
lace
again
a
decent
but
not
spectacular
aspect
of
the
beer
is
the
aroma
as
i
pick
up
hints
of
roasted
malts
but
not
much
else
in
the
malts
or
anything
really
in
the
hops
department
beer
is
smooth
slightly
creamy
but
unfortunately
offbalance
for
a
sweet
stout
or
any
stout
really
in
my
opinion
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
the
alcohol
or
the
strong
presence
of
roasted
even
possibly
some
toasted
or
coffee
malt
maybe
toffee
but
the
bitter
chocolate
and
caramel
sugary
sweetness
is
overpowered
by
a
dry
harsh
malt
tasting
sensation
and
there
really
isnt
much
hoppiness
to
balance
or
give
off
that
rare
fruit
flavor
the
beer
is
balanced
enough
to
avoid
being
sticky
cloying
or
in
this
brews
case
just
too
dry
and
a
taste
bud
killer
so
i
cant
say
its
that
bad
and
i
did
enjoy
it
as
a
sipper
just
wish
they
could
mellow
out
the
beer
a
little
to
let
the
sweetness
come
through
and
then
it
would
be
a
great
beer
this
poured
poured
a
rich
syrupy
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
on
top
the
retention
fades
quickly
and
there
is
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
deep
roasted
aroma
with
a
good
amount
of
molasses
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
chocolatey
its
rich
with
dark
malts
and
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
its
creamy
and
oily
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
not
the
prettiest
looking
beer
but
all
and
all
its
a
tasty
brew
o
well
the
label
describes
this
as
an
imperial
chocolate
milk
stout
thats
exactly
what
it
is
pretty
onenote
lots
of
chocolate
flavors
from
start
to
finish
that
doesnt
make
it
bad
in
fact
its
quite
enjoyable
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
southern
tier
choklat
pure
chocolate
with
lots
of
sweetness
this
isnt
quite
so
sweet
it
actually
has
a
little
bitter
cocoa
aspect
but
its
close
at
the
same
time
it
just
doesnt
hold
up
quite
the
same
maybe
not
quite
as
rich
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
thin
compared
too
i
didnt
mean
for
this
to
be
a
comparison
element
but
if
youve
ever
had
choklat
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
o
good
beer
i
dont
like
sweet
beers
and
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
me
its
not
so
good
like
i
want
a
very
good
stout
good
stuff
good
english
stout
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
cream
stout
i
really
enjoyed
it
cool
looking
bottle
too
overall
by
and
large
i
do
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
it
started
very
well
and
the
middle
flagged
a
little
before
a
very
pleasing
finish
this
is
an
odd
way
to
describe
a
beer
and
i
have
not
had
many
beers
that
seemed
to
drink
differently
as
the
bottle
goes
down
it
pares
well
with
dried
sausage
and
gouda
cheese
o
i
think
st
peters
make
some
of
the
best
bottled
beer
in
britain
overall
not
my
favorite
stout
by
far
but
its
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
i
think
there
are
better
stouts
for
the
money
but
definitely
worth
trying
sidenote
i
found
myself
not
impressed
what
so
ever
when
i
first
poured
got
exponentially
better
as
it
warmed
ode
to
a
cream
stout
one
downfall
i
noticed
immediately
was
this
beer
isnt
much
of
a
stout
but
good
none
the
less
strong
malt
and
chocolate
taste
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
a
great
dessert
beer
to
finish
a
meal
o
in
two
minds
on
how
to
write
this
up
this
is
like
a
very
good
version
of
guinness
with
no
real
flaws
goes
down
super
easy
my
criticism
would
be
does
it
have
to
be
6
5
to
achieve
that
buy
it
if
you
are
a
general
stout
fan
you
will
enjoy
it
without
being
blown
away
if
you
are
an
stout
fan
from
england
looking
for
our
equivalent
of
founders
et
al
this
is
nowhere
near
o
excellent
overall
excellent
stout
every
note
fits
perfectly
with
the
others
its

excellent

ill
definitely
have
this

o
world

2nd
best
beer
ive
had
to
date
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
a
worth
once
maybe
on
sale
but
still
kinda
a
bad
beer
il
probably
never
try
it
again
and
do
not
recommend
it
get
double
cream
ale
instead
its
a
far
better
made
brew
overall
this
was
my
first
cream
stout
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
was
a
lot
brighter
and
hoppier
than
any
other
stout
ive
had
but
the
tastes
came
together
well
making
it
enjoyble
to
drink
pours
almost
black
with
just
a
tad
of
a
beige
head
which
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
perfect
carbonation
and
not
real
fizzy
like
i
like
them
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
coffee
the
taste
is
the
about
same
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
simply
love
this
one
this
is
the
best
that
it
gets
in
my
opinion
my
favorite
cream
stout
to
date
o
great
beer
nice
to
mix
it
up
o
this
review
is
old
so
notes
are
pretty
minimal
i
do
remember
liking
this
a
lot
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
beers
its
definitely
worth
the
4
price
tag
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
reminded
me
of
an
irish
beer
i
used
to
be
able
to
find
in
the
90s
cant
remember
then
exact
name
but
it
started
with
a
w
something
like
warners
it
was
a
sad
day
when
the
nice
man
at
the
beer
store
told
me
they
stopped
making
it
it
was
the
first
stout
i
had
besides
guiness
and
i
thought
it
was
amazing
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
ill
be
looking
for
more
to
me
this
a
quite
light
imperial
stout
very
nice
and
pleasant
however
not
a
match
to
e
g
samuel
smith
pours
with
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
and
a
very
small
offcolor
head
theres
virtually
no
bubbles
present
the
aroma
is
very
gentle
some
malts
and
some
alcohol
aroma
the
taste
is
contrary
to
expectations
not
very
strong
pleasantly
creamy
with
quite
some
roastiness
and
some
little
coffee
due
to
lack
of
carbo
it
has
a
slightly
stale
feel
but
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
almost
like
a
foreign
export
stout
sweet
and
laced
with
more
alcohol
than
anticipated
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
the
taste
was
certainly
one
that
grew
on
me
although
its
unlikely
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
o
this
was
one
of
my
first
favorite
stouts
thats
probably
because
it
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
leaned
to
the
sweeter
side
of
things
today
i
see
it
more
as
a
summertime
stout
fruity
and
light
i
can
definitely
envision
drinking
during
a
bbq
cookout
not
as
consistent
or
smooth
and
i
hoped
for
but
a
fair
experience
i
will
probably
give
it
another
good
try
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
while
not
being
adventurous
enough
to
try
something
new
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
slight
char
aromas
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
soy
sauce
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
much
the
same
with
bittersweet
cocoa
and
char
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
solid
roasty
and
cocoa
presence
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
smell

3
5
d
good
beer
but
i
rather
like
st
ps
other
offerings
more
this
is
really
a
creamy
delight
the
nice
taste
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
coats
the
tongue
its
an
excellent
milk
stout
i
would
get
this
again
this
is
a
remarkably
smooth
beer
creamy
silky
and
velvety
the
only
offense
any
beer
lover
could
find
is
that
they
might
expect
more
body
in
a
stout
the
thing
is
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
if
you
want
to
be
destroyed
pick
up
a
properly
made
ris
but
its
no
real
shortcoming
here
o
kind
of
a
plain
cream
stout
not
as
creamy
as
id
like
and
not
nearly
enough
roasted
malt
to
back
it
up
just
kinda
meh
all
around
rjt
rich
creamy
body
but
with
lively
carbonation
as
well
lactic
sweetness
throughout
with
sweet
chocolate
notes
and
nutella
and
grainy
toasted
biscuit
finishes
with
a
roast
and
coffee
bitterness
smooth
and
nicely
balance
not
overly
sweet
with
a
unique
body
i
like
it
pours
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
sparse
khaki
colored
head
aroma
is
mild
and
roasty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
roasted
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
but
the
character
is
not
particularly
like
coffee
or
chocolatejust
a
general
roasted
flavor
lactose
comes
through
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
moreso
as
the
beer
warms
some
alcoholic
warmth
is
also
noticeable
but
its
not
especially
strong
hop
flavor
is
fairly
mild
just
enough
to
lend
some
balance
carbonation
feels
a
shade
higher
than
necessary
for
the
style
and
the
body
could
be
a
little
fuller
with
that
said
this
remains
a
safe
and
drinkable
english
stout
d
heavy
but
nice
definitely
up
to
snuff
as
they
say
fast
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
calling
it
a
cream
stout
is
a
bit
misleading
in
my
opinion
its
more
of
a
dark
ale
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
fruit
it
is
fairly
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
in
a
creamy
sense
i
almost
dont
know
what
to
say
about
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
wine
o
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
smoky
yet
sweet
with
a
bitter
chocolaty
finish
my
only
complaint
was
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
for
me
o
what
a
great
beer
simple
and
to
the
point
this
one
lacks
complexity
but
complexity
isnt
what
im
after
by
coming
to
a
milk
stout
st
peters
delivered
a
very
distinc
stout
it
pours
a
mean
dense
black
color
with
a
nearly
two
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
ring
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
little
sweet
can
definitely
smell
those
milk
sugars
left
over
as
well
as
an
oddly
potent
alcohol
content
for
a
beer
under
7
abv
some
dark
chocolate
and
creamy
vanilla
are
in
the
first
flavors
i
taste
it
would
be
sweet
but
the
bitter
burnt
malts
temper
the
sweetness
perfectly
there
again
is
that
booze
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
in
terms
of
body
but
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
very
light
and
this
feels
traditional
to
me
in
some
way
also
love
the
packaging
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
a
nice
illustration
of
the
milk
stout
genre
o
not
a
super
tasty
beer
but
still
one
that
you
can
drink
with
ease
and
great
pleasure
o
very
drinkable
quite
smooth
and
pleasant
stout
recommended
o
this
is
a
good
cream
stout
lots
of
character
and
flavor
overall
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
hard
to
top
which
the
smell
couldve
been
richer
however
its
very
easy
to
overlook
its
flaws
just
because
it
tastes
so
damn
good
even
if
you
dont
like
stouts
you
need
to
try
this
out
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
i
find
this
is
the
way
a
milk
stout
should
be
like
i
wish
the
writing
on
the
label
wasnt
so
small
so
i
could
actually
read
it
this
is
entirely
too
metallic
and
it
stays
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
no
me
gusta
the
hop
bite
is
a
bit
more
predominant
in
the
taste
but
overall
it
still
embodies
a
sweet
dark
malt
and
licorice
character
still
a
likable
enough
beer
a
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
really
good
example
of
the
type
cheap
too
gonna
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
pours
a
nice
black
tan
as
a
cream
stout
should
nothing
too
strong
on
the
nose
nice
a
creamy
taste
but
surprisingly
not
as
creamy
of
a
feel
there
is
a
touch
of
carbonation
which
is
odd
but
it
doesnt
really
diminish
the
quality
of
the
stout
its
also
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
style
suggests
but
the
chocolate
coffee
flavors
are
still
quite
tasty
overall
not
quite
as
good
as
suggested
dont
get
the
sweetness
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
a
tinge
of
mahogany
when
held
to
the
light
one
finger
head
that
quickly
faded
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
definitely
leans
more
towards
sweet
than
roasty
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
vanilla
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
with
just
a
touch
of
banana
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
nose
but
still
leaning
to
the
sweet
side
dark
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
coffee
dominate
along
with
hints
of
bubblegum
toffee
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
not
as
creamy
as
i
was
expecting
with
a
nice
subtle
bitter
smooth
finish
not
really
all
that
familiar
with
the
style
and
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
solid
offering
nonetheless
taste
is
very
mellow
roasted
malts
nothing
exciting
nothing
to
clamor
about
it
gets
slightly
more
sweet
as
it
heats
up
a
little
sweet
rum
flavor
to
go
with
the
maltiness
probably
a
good
introductory
beer
for
someone
branching
out
from
macro
brews
poured
virtually
black
thin
dark
head
that
left
littleno
lacing
smell
was
a
hard
to
pick
up
on
but
consisted
mostly
of
the
roasted
tones
and
those
of
alcohol
an
almost
wine
like
essence
tasted
good
screamed
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
the
overall
feel
could
have
been
creamier
considering
the
style
overall
good
beer
but
the
job
i
purchased
it
for
to
pour
over
vanilla
ice
cream
was
better
suited
for
a
stout
counterpart
cheers
black
colour
with
a

head
not
too
big
for
a

also
it
doesnt
hold
as
much
as
other
stouts
though
it
leaves
a
ring
that
never
dissappears

maybe
to

for

but
it
makes
a
difference
i
think
ill
buy
some
more
of
this
one
o
it
was
ok
almost
felt
like
drinking
a
wine
though
didnt
get
the
flavor
or
sweetness
i
was
expecting
from
a
sweet
stout
conclusion
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
is
quite
good
and
a
very
fine
english
stout
my
first
sip
blew
me
away
and
i
thought
it
might
be
a
new
favorite
but
after
the
glass
was
drained
i
wasnt
was
sure
if
anything
i
like
this
beer
because
it
is
interesting
and
different
from
the
usual
fare
overall
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
i
think
of
this
stout
different
yes
bad
no
will
acquire
again
to
see
what
my
thoughts
are
in
the
future
overall
a
great
flavor
and
a
great
beer
an
everyday
beer
maybe
not
but
great
for
a
winters
night
full
bodied
light
effervescence
a
nice
warming
aspect
to
it
mostly
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
finish
is
smooth
and
mellow
nice
stuff
all
around
overall
enjoyable
but
it
could
use
a
little
improvement
needs
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
stout
but
i
would
have
liked
the
taste
to
be
smoother
o
a
good
choice
overall
i
selected
it
randomly
after
seeing
it
on
menu
and
checking
reviews
here
very
tasty
enjoyed
it
as
after
dinner
treat
with
my
buddy
at
local
pub
would
recommend
for
someone
looking
for
a
flavorfull
beer
that
wont
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
really
liked
how
it
meshed
well
as
night
was
winding
down
the
beer
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
lasting
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
a
light
roast
chocolates
english
malts
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
and
i
am
reminded
how
much
i
like
it
silky
smooth
and
creamy
feel
chocolate
and
a
delicate
roast
character
finishing
with
a
milk
chocolate
creaminess
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
and
mild
bittering
hops
light
bodied
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
though
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
overall
a
solid
beer
to
which
i
will
return
o
this
is
an
above
average
creammilk
stout
and
i
love
the
bottle
but
i
did
like
the
sam
adams
one
better
areas
for
improvement
are
the
head
and
the
mouthfeel
still
a
solid
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
good
after
dinner
beer
or
a
nightcap
overall
good
beer
i
will
pick
this
up
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
said
i
am
new
to
cream
stouts
but
i
liked
it
this
is
a
difficult
beer
for
me
to
rate
because
its
flavorful
and
because
i
find
it
enjoyable
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
cream
stout
it
still
holds
up
well
for
a
stout
though
d
i
dont
know
the
abv
but
this
is
surprisingly
quaffable
even
though
a
bit
rich
i
like
this
one
enough
to
drink
it
on
tap
or
for
less
than
the
4
99
i
spent
on
it
i
dont
think
this
is
really
a
go
to
beer
and
perhaps
it
isnt
meant
to
be
it
is
a
good
example
of
english
flavors
in
a
tout
for
the
american
whos
not
given
beers
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
a
try
when
i
worked
retail
i
had
a
guy
whod
come
and
buy
this
one
three
cases
at
a
time
cleaning
us
out
with
each
visit
he
rarely
bought
anything
else
he
later
ended
up
as
a
neighbor
and
i
discovered
that
he
rarely
drank
alcoholic
beverages
of
any
kind
i
do
not
like
sweet
beer
but
this
one
manages
to
come
off
as
slightly
sweet
but
not
at
all
sticky
with
a
nice
dry
finish
all
at
once
pleasant
fuggles
bitterness
with
a
lush
creamy
chocolate
flavor
and
mouthfeel
mostly
roasty
malt
in
the
nose
which
is
strong
in
the
flavor
profile
along
with
the
milk
chocolate
vague
toffee
i
got
much
less
coffee
than
most
other
tasters
not
complicated
or
overly
busy
just
smooth
and
delicious
highly
recommended
as
liquid
dessert
rich
and
a
little
naughty
i
guess
but
not
the
icky
treat
your
nose
prepares
you
for
seven
thumbs
up
o
i
am
not
digging
this
beer
its
like
drinking
liquid
licorice
to
me
and
i
dont
like
licorice
not
a
beer
i
cared
for
surprising
since
i
did
like
it
at
a
tasting
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
deep
brownmahogony
very
close
to
black
small
1
finger
head
that
vanishes
quickly
with
some
okay
spot
lacing
smell
is
coffee
and
sweet
milksugar
falls
in
line
with
a
milk
stout
with
some
dark
chocolate
coming
through
on
the
end
some
fig
notes
as
well
nice
complex
taste
feel
is
of
silk
and
cream
iced
coffee
with
a
mild
hint
of
carbonation
good
medium
mouthfeel
to
add
to
the
great
smooth
taste
overall
wow
really
a
surprise
a
very
good
milk
stout
with
complex
flavors
and
great
feel
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
could
drink
a
few
without
a
problem
nice
body
and
a
solid
all
around
effort
very
tasty
overall
maybe
im
spoiled
by
american
stouts
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
punch
its
good
but
not
great
o
not
too
bad
at
all
i
like
the
tastes
and
flavors
but
would
love
them
to
jump
out
a
bit
more
but
definitely
tasty
o
this
brew
does
nothing
great
but
everything
well
its
solid
all
the
way
around
and
a
very
nice
value
will
have
it
again
as
i
would
deem
it
sessionable
affordable
and
of
good
quality
o
not
the
most
multidimensional
beer
out
there
but
very
sessionable
and
just
a
great
drinking
experience
a
lot
going
on
in
this
stout
too
much
for
me
to
be
honest
boardering
on
sickly
sweet
and
just
a
little
to
creamy
for
me
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
cream
stout
ive
ever
had
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
prime
example
of
a
cream
stout
no
attributes
are
forced
with
a
good
progression
and
decent
mouthfeel
despite
a
notable
thickness
d
not
a
bad
milkcreamsweet
stout
by
any
means
just
average
it
is
what
it
is
nice
enough
but
nothing
outstanding
here
move
along
st
peters
models
itself
as
the
classic
image
of
the
english
brewery
drawing
from
its
locale
and
surrounding
environment
to
spin
together
a
truly
english
brew
its
the
image
americans
seek
as
they
sojourn
around
the
english
countryside
hunting
for
the
uberlocal
beers
that
distinguish
one
pub
from
another
the
bottle
and
label
for
st
peters
line
of
beers
adds
to
this
local
and
anglosaxon
flavor
and
to
be
honest
the
flavor
too
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
cloying
though
without
the
dark
chocolate
malts
or
roasted
flavors
i
typically
associated
with
stouts
and
their
style
offshoots
this
is
sweet
and
light
packed
with
scents
of
sugary
grapes
and
cough
medicine
for
those
beer
drinkers
who
enjoy
welloperated
historical
events
and
museums
this
tastes
like
something
youd
receive
as
a
sample
to
illustrate
what
the
original
root
beer
recipe
tasted
like
i
even
imagined
it
tasting
like
an
oldtimey
panacea
curing
all
your
aches
pains
and
even
stubborn
cases
of
polio
the
flavor
has
a
similar
taste
with
sassafras
and
the
raw
herbal
quality
of
a
homemade
root
beer
its
a
singular
taste
but
one
im
unaccustomed
to
with
a
palate
and
flavor
that
distinguish
this
beer
as
an
oldfashioned
flavor
looking
to
impact
modern
palates
would
definitely
recommend
nice
lots
of
flavour
a
stout
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
character
and
a
hint
of
lactose
sweetness
to
add
balance
the
only
minus
is
the
body
which
could
have
been
a
tad
more
substantial
that
said
its
a
great
beer
and
well
worth
sampling
o
an
average
stout
check
it
out
if
you
want
to
not
necessarily
a
must
have
but
you
can
certainly
do
considerably
worse
m
medium
to
heavy
body
carbonation
is
good
as
it
was
held
in
check
good
warming
a
little
alc
bite
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
top
of
the
class
for
me
not
enough
of
that
yummy
lactose
milkycreaminess
you
get
in
other
better
examples
like
lancaster
which
is
still
tops
in
my
book
good
but
not
great
a
classic
in
the
sweet
stout
category
and
i
can
see
why
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
are
both
mellowly
sweet
with
just
enough
roast
to
balance
and
make
me
believe
that
it
is
in
fact
a
stout
delicious
and
smoothi
love
it
o
with
6
5
abv
this
is
a
great
pint
if
you
only
have
time
for
one
but
its
flavor
is
not
tiring
on
the
palate
tasty
cream
stout
with
unique
flavors
which
make
up
for
the
smell
overall
i
was
surprised
how
gd
this
was
a
nice
solid
stout
that
i
will
be
having
again
again
as
it
stands
it
is
still
a
very
worthy
cream
stout
and
one
that
should
be
tried
if
found
sitting
in
your
local
brew
store
o
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
it
looked
great
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
didnt
pack
to
much
with
its
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
good
with
the
best
part
being
the
malty
after
taste
id
recommend
checking
out
this
beer
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
a
real
smooth
creamy
feel
to
it
that
just
makes
it
go
down
very
easily
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
i
havent
had
many
milk
stouts
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
would
drink
it
again
taste
was
incrediable
smooth
couldnt
help
but
notice
a
dry
vanilla
finish
delightful
for
a
stout
will
buy
again
although
wont
share
it
with
my
husband
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beerit
was
a
great
treat
after
my
21mile
hike
today
overall
a
very
characteristic
british
stout
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
sweetish
and
malty
very
biscuity
if
youre
an
english
dark
beer
fan
yes
if
youre
looking
for
a
drier
irish
stout
i
wasnt
pass
poured
into
a
leffe
goblet
a
dark
brownblack
with
not
quite
a
finger
of
light
brown
head
that
receded
to
a
patchy
layer
good
aroma
though
not
very
pronounced
as
id
imagined
it
would
be
roasty
malts
and
coffee
beans
with
some
hints
of
dark
chocolate
taste
was
not
what
i
expected
either
subtle
caramel
pumpernickel
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
citrusy
notes
much
more
bitter
than
is
typical
for
a
stout
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
and
a
finish
perhaps
more
suited
to
a
dry
stout
medium
mouthfeel
a
lot
lighter
than
it
seems
it
should
be
drinkable
but
not
quite
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
o
very
tasty
and
refreshing
easy
drinker
my
only
real
compaint
is
with
the
price
tag
at
6
usd
this
beer
is
too
expensive
for
me
to
like
any
more
than
this
im
having
trouble
finishing
the
one
bomber
i
started
i
cant
imagine
trying
to
down
another
in
fact
this
beer
may
have
ruined
me
for
the
night
was
worth
a
try
and
had
high
hopes
but
thats
where
it
ends
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wonder
if
they
have
this
on
tap
anywhere
around
here
i
wonder
if
that
would
add
that
level
of
carbonation
i
am
looking
for
overall
im
not
heavy
on
stouts
but
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
attempt
at
a
cream
stout
a
great
starting
point
for
anybody
interested
in
the
style
o
do
all
bottles
have
this
odd
flavor
to
them
if
so
im
not
a
huge
fan
if
not
i
need
a
noninfected
bottle
to
try
havent
had
this
beer
for
some
time
so
my
memory
may
be
a
little
foggy
on
this
one
but
they
no
longer
sell
it
where
i
bought
it
so
i
cannot
obtain
it
anymore
regardless
it
has
a
unique
bottle
looks
very
home
made
in
appearance
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
on
this
one
as
well
the
mouth
feel
it
was
heavy
but
extremely
smooth
sweet
in
all
of
the
right
places
with
raisin
type
sweetness
i
could
also
taste
of
chocolate
a
much
more
friendly
stout
compared
to
others
who
do
not
like
the
more
agressive
stouts
it
is
among
my
top
beers
that
i
have
had
highly
recomended
m
very
creamy
and
smooth
could
be
a
bit
less
carbonated
pours
a
pitch
black
with
medium
head
smells
of
lactate
since
im
assuming
thats
what
they
added
since
its
a
sweet
stout
its
sweet
so
there
is
no
alcohol
taste
even
though
its
only
6
5
percent
abv
so
there
shouldnt
really
be
any
alcohol
taste
to
begin
with
its
a
nice
smooth
stout
and
the
creaminess
adds
a
whole
another
texture
its
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
immense
stouts
i
drink
supremely
disappointed
considering
what
i
couldve
bought
with
this
4
bucks
lets
hear
it
for
the
good
ol
u
s
a
who
has
proven
they
are
the
new
stout
kings
of
the
planet
this
watery
alcohol
ridden
oversweetmess
can
stay
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
for
all
i
care
i
just
cant
get
over
the
sourness
of
this
beer
its
like
someone
took
a
good
american
stout
and
poured
a
coors
light
silver
bullet
into
it
d
dark
and
fairly
complex
with
a
low
level
of
roasted
character
there
is
a
distinct
note
of
licorice
present
throughout
that
blends
well
with
the
molasses
like
malt
some
roast
character
does
finally
come
out
in
the
finish
with
a
light
coffee
note
that
helps
to
balance
out
the
significant
sweetness
not
bad
but
like
everything
else
that
i
have
had
from
st
peters
i
cant
help
but
think
that
many
other
breweries
make
a
better
version
of
the
same
beer
overall
this
beer
is
not
overly
special
at
about
5
per
bottle
its
better
to
just
stick
with
a
10
four
pack
of
some
other
cream
stout
nice
bottle
and
labeling
but
overall
not
worth
its
price
o
this
is
one
helluva
stout
take
whatever
means
necessary
to
acquire
one
of
these
and
try
it
as
soon
as
possible
very
enjoyable
stout
good
roast
and
balance
its
on
the
dry
side
but
is
very
balanced
o
a
really
good
beer
and
probably
the
best
milk
stout
ive
had
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
poured
pitch
black
with
brown
around
the
edges
and
a
one
finger
mocha
head
each
time
i
smelled
it
i
got
something
different
everything
from
fruit
bread
sweet
toffee
to
roasted
coffee
taste
had
the
fruit
up
front
with
the
bread
followed
by
a
slight
smokey
flavored
coffee
taste
mouthfeel
was
slightly
creamy
but
not
tooo
much
with
medium
amount
of
carbonation
went
down
pretty
smooth
my
overall
impression
was
this
is
a
decent
stout
and
glad
i
tried
it
this
stout
pours
out
as
a
black
color
with
a
rich
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
big
with
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
in
the
mix
too
the
taste
is
slightly
salty
from
the
smokiness
the
roasted
malts
give
off
a
really
nice
toasted
burnt
quality
that
really
nice
the
beer
doesnt
have
too
much
in
way
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
overall
this
turned
out
to
be
better
than
i
had
anticipated
and
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
i
think
any
stout
lover
will
enjoy
it
overall
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
smooth
or
sweet
as
many
milkcream
stouts
but
is
still
a
very
solid
beer
the
british
hops
really
come
through
but
in
a
pleasing
and
delicate
way
they
arent
overly
bitter
or
intrusive
i
have
had
this
before
and
i
will
have
it
again
this
is
definitely
very
drinkable
i
think
the
bitterness
might
put
off
some
but
the
medium
body
means
its
easy
to
get
down
this
beer
was
better
than
i
anticipated
its
one
of
the
most
balanced
cream
stouts
ive
ever
had
its
far
from
a
mindblowing
beer
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
particularly
since
it
isnt
very
filling
and
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
i
havent
tried
much
cream
stouts
but
this
the
best
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
dquite
easy
to
drink
in
terms
of
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
good
but
doesnt
leave
me
asking
for
more
dvery
drinkable
good
example
of
a
cream
stout
d
much
more
drinkable
than
commercial
stouts
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
a
night
without
feeling
overpowered
st
peters
makes
a
drinkable
milk
stout
but
not
one
that
id
ever
seek
out
with
the
plethora
of
great
options
available
its
good
but
there
are
many
that
are
better
drinkability
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
but
would
only
enjoy
one
at
the
middle
to
end
of
the
night
awesome
and
would
point
a
stout
drinker
into
the
direction
of
this
stout
for
sure
pours
black
with
a
slight
head
and
quite
a
few
moderatelysized
bubbles
head
recedes
quickly
without
leaving
too
much
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
a
pretty
strong
buttery
component
another
off
flavor
is
not
what
i
need
from
this
brewery
after
the
pale
ale
there
is
some
slight
roast
and
chocolate
as
well
so
at
least
theres
something
to
cover
the
diacetyl
up
a
bit
im
not
that
fortunate
with
the
taste
as
this
is
more
buttery
than
the
nose
though
there
still
is
a
slight
roast
component
that
shows
up
somewhat
dry
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
buttery
mouthcoating
component
not
something
i
would
try
again
taste
starts
a
chocolately
sweet
then
gets
roasty
and
dry
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
hops
in
there
lower
carbonation
very
smooth
mouthfeel
easy
drinkin
classic
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
beer
mug
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
decent
midbrown
colored
foamy
head
the
smell
is
oaky
sweet
and
bitterfruit
the
beer
is
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
and
the
tastes
are
heavy
in
cream
coffeestyle
bitter
flavors
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
sour
undertones
the
beer
is
quick
and
light
on
the
finish
with
a
semisweet
aftertaste
the
light
bodiedness
for
a
stout
makes
it
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
sweet
stout
conclusion
the
taste
was
basic
but
well
put
together
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
and
other
st
peters
brew
wow
this
beer
is
really
sweet
it
has
this
candy
midpalate
and
late
flavors
probably
from
caramelization
of
the
wort
its
medium
in
body
i
just
cant
get
past
that
caramel
flavor
its
awesome
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
this
brewery
is
redeemed
in
my
mind
green
bottles
and
all
seriously
though
buy
some
brown
bottles
drinkability
this
one
went
quite
fast
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
went
very
well
with
welsh
rabbit
and
i
think
would
be
good
with
many
other
meals
since
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
sneaks
up
on
you
making
this
beer
a
bit
dangerous
and
yet
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
overall
quite
the
flavor
packed
stout
for
being
so
light
and
watery
more
ester
and
fig
notes
in
this
one
rather
than
chocolate
or
coffee
over
all
this
is
a
solid
stout
pint
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
finger
of
creamy
head
which
leaves
a
little
lacing
nose
is
caramel
sweetness
hints
of
roast
open
up
in
the
flavor
bitter
chocolate
milky
sweetness
nice
barley
roast
caramel
biscuit
a
real
nice
english
stout
remarkably
drinkable
drinks
more
like
a
4
5
and
yet
full
flavored
balanced
sweetness
surprised
me
i
recommend
to
try
but
i
do
not
plan
on
buying
again
overall
a
decent
stout
its
a
pretty
filling
drink
though
d
rather
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
finishing
this
one
but
im
not
sure
id
rush
to
get
another
one
right
away
drinkability
relatively
so
one
of
the
few
creammilk
stouts
ive
had
though
i
am
enjoying
it
tonight
d
well
aside
from
the
very
classy
pirate
rum
smuggler
bottle
and
the
nice
feel
theres
not
a
whole
lot
outstanding
about
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
worth
a
special
trip
great
atmosphere
deep
dark
intimidating
appearance
with
a
churning
head
nose
is
rich
and
deep
although
not
complex
but
a
great
mix
of
components
flavor
is
rich
and
robust
and
creamy
and
bitter
and
sweet
what
a
combo
done
very
well
as
nothing
really
tries
to
take
first
place
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
m
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
body
the
only
downside
is
that
the
stout
aftertaste
can
be
bitter
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
it
goes
great
with
a
shot
of
cofee
liqueur
and
a
nice
apple
pie
d
goes
somethin
like
this
its
4am
ready
for
bed
havin
a
beer
right
quick
then
im
out
i
figured
this
one
would
be
bout
4
25
0
abv
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
so
i
just
keep
chuggin
away
then
i
look
at
their
website
and
see
this
bad
boy
is
6
5
and
the
beers
gettin
warmed
up
by
now
and
i
get
a
whiff
of
alcohol
and
my
thoughts
are
beginning
to
wander
and
im
writing
meaningless
shit
like
this
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
this
is
a
big
brew
in
every
category
and
it
drinks
like
a
guinness
or
something
much
less
potent
went
down
so
easily
that
i
could
easily
get
into
trouble
easily
after
a
few
pints
of
this
potion
easily
see
im
already
being
obnoxious
nite
you
could
never
tell
when
staring
at
the
green
bottle
that
this
beer
would
be
pure
black
when
it
pours
into
a
clear
glass
but
even
when
held
toward
the
lght
i
dont
see
any
ruby
highlights
head
is
a
light
tan
in
color
wih
a
great
billowing
doughnut
texture
going
on
lacing
is
fine
and
even
and
i
cant
get
over
these
medicine
bottles
a
bit
different
then
they
used
to
be
but
still
unique
nose
has
some
dark
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
black
licorice
an
some
smoked
malt
or
peat
kilned
malts
going
on
also
hints
of
coffee
and
creamy
dark
chocolate
come
out
in
the
aroma
flavor
brings
on
some
acidity
between
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
the
addition
of
the
lactose
this
beer
finishes
slighty
tart
and
smokey
with
again
peat
smoked
malts
kicking
in
earthy
fruitines
and
subdued
bitterness
from
the
fuggles
and
challenger
hop
additions
very
fresh
tasting
this
beer
just
came
in
at
my
local
the
sharp
acidic
notes
and
fruity
undertones
really
make
this
an
interesting
experience
solid
cream
stout
from
across
the
pond
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
but
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
the
bruising
american
or
russian
versions
of
this
style
mellow
carbonation
works
well
with
the
style
this
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
up
drinkability
overall
is
great
a
nice
flavorful
and
easy
to
consume
stout
this
one
wont
weight
you
down
like
many
big
stouts
on
the
market
though
this
may
sound
a
bit
odd
for
its
style
this
beer
is
definitely
a
good
option
if
you
are
craving
russian
imperial
stout
flavor
wrapped
in
a
lighter
and
lower
abv
package
d
very
drinkable
if
you
are
into
english
stouts
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
with
the
relatively
low
abv
exceptionally
well
bottled
and
packaged
and
exceptionally
good
as
well
you
can
judge
the
book
by
the
cover
here
you
will
notice
the
nice
bottle
and
label
and
when
you
crack
it
open
it
does
not
disappoint
the
beer
itself
is
relatively
light
for
a
stout
with
lower
than
usual
abv
for
a
stou
bu
it
has
a
huge
taste
these
guys
really
know
how
to
make
a
good
stout
balanced
beer
good
taste
and
looking
good
low
carbonation
and
slick
body
perhaps
st
peters
would
do
better
with
a
darker
bottle
just
great
its
as
english
as
monty
python
black
sabbath
and
bangers
mash
but
in
a
way
that
would
appeal
to
beer
drinkers
who
prefer
big
flavor
lots
of
depth
and
some
kind
of
unique
character
that
no
other
beer
has
this
one
has
all
that
if
youve
ever
doubted
youre
into
english
beers
this
one
could
very
well
change
your
mind
smells
like
cola
and
vanilla
the
mouth
feel
jumps
out
at
you
as
a
bit
viscous
and
slick
but
this
is
the
first
sweet
stout
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
probably
the
worst
part
of
the
experience
i
have
to
admit
for
someone
me
who
normally
isnt
a
big
residual
sweetness
sort
of
person
this
works
no
roast
or
toast
mainly
dark
malt
with
a
little
caramel
some
fruit
and
a
creamy
sweetness
that
hangs
around
in
your
mouth
a
while
the
total
experience
is
quite
nice
but
i
could
only
drink
one
at
a
time
all
in
all
not
too
much
special
in
this
brew
might
be
ok
to
try
once
but
not
worth
multiple
purchases
rich
full
body
with
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
sweet
and
quite
so
however
as
the
luxurious
fruity
and
somewhat
cocoaflavored
liquid
oozes
over
my
palate
i
am
eventually
left
with
a
mild
bitter
almost
tart
and
definitely
drying
finish
that
somehow
balances
the
sweetness
and
keeps
the
beer
well
short
of
cloying
if
there
is
diacetyl
i
am
not
able
to
identify
it
as
such
if
i
am
quibbling
it
is
to
say
that
the
beer
could
have
more
darkchocolateroast
stereotypical
stout
character
as
the
fruitiness
is
pretty
dominant
the
carbonation
is
soft
the
body
medium
or
higher
but
never
overly
filling
and
it
is
creamier
than
many
big
stouts
really
really
well
done
notes
best
before
nov
2010
seems
like
it
is
somewhere
in
between
a
milksweet
stout
and
a
normal
stout
but
it
shades
closer
to
a
milksweet
nice
balance
of
flavor
mixing
the
earthyroasted
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
also
enjoyable
to
have
the
chocolate
taste
go
from
dark
toward
milk
chocolate
during
the
taste
nice
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
want
a
sweeter
stout
but
not
one
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
worth
trying
if
it
is
reasonably
priced
but
not
one
you
necessarily
have
to
try
d
as
opposed
to
the
porter
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
a
great
example
of
this
all
to
rare
style
a
very
enjoyable
pint
drinkability
very
good
alcohol
well
hidden
nice
interpretation
very
distinct
no
apparent
flaws
not
coying
nice
pricequality
ratio
had
this
with
a
blue
dauverne
cheese
matched
great
thsi
cream
stout
just
wasnt
as
creamy
as
i
was
hoping
for
taste
good
i
enjoyed
it
carbonation
is
off
like
some
one
else
said
i
agree
with
him
all
in
all
i
liked
it
not
my
favorite
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
special
for
flavor
i
would
drink
again
looking
for
a
good
winddown
beer
after
work
excellent
example
of
a
prime
burtonstyle
stout
d
the
mildness
makes
it
both
very
drinkable
and
very
passable
were
the
flavor
a
little
deeper
t
would
be
better
wish
this
one
was
a
little
thicker
and
creamier
still
a
good
stout
final
thoughts
well
for
the
most
part
st
peters
continues
to
disappoint
me
this
may
be
worlds
better
then
their
english
ale
but
this
offering
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
i
think
fundamentally
the
issue
here
is
it
comes
off
as
milky
instead
of
creamy
i
sadly
would
not
suggest
this
one
pours
an
opaque
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
thick
if
not
persistent
dirty
beige
head
aroma
is
smoky
with
a
strong
molasses
overtone
and
hints
of
chocolate
flavor
has
a
hickory
smoke
tone
and
firm
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
licorice
texture
is
rough
edgy
and
a
little
thick
the
way
a
good
stout
should
be
worth
finding
i
would
try
it
again
but
definitely
wouldnt
buy
it
very
easy
to
drink
you
can
really
lay
this
one
back
aroma
of
roasted
barley
mild
coffee
flavor
a
huge
roasted
barley
smack
then
a
nice
mild
and
full
malt
body
makes
its
way
to
your
palate
a
lingering
sweetness
is
present
but
balances
well
with
the
roast
caracter
that
sticks
around
as
well
finished
quite
dry
and
begs
you
for
another
sip
absolutely
delicious
try
it
pint
bottle
from
life
source
salem
very
handsome
looking
ale
darkest
mahogany
with
a
small
yet
persistent
tan
head
loved
the
chocolatyroastytoasted
aroma
on
this
one
coffee
brazil
nuts
dark
choclate
very
earthy
wonderful
scent
taste
is
much
the
same
very
wonderful
great
creamy
mouthfeel
to
this
silky
and
easy
over
the
taste
buds
overall
a
very
nice
stout
indeed
will
buy
more
really
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
not
bad
and
a
nice
bottle
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
do
i
feel
its
intriguing
or
just
weird
i
find
it
being
somewhere
between
a
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
and
im
sorry
but
i
dont
like
it
very
much
d
a
very
fine
example
of
a
sweet
stout
and
one
i
will
recommend
to
all
of
my
friends
st
peters
hit
a
home
run
with
this
brew
d
easy
to
drink
would
have
more
than
one
or
a
larger
format
much
better
than
the
english
ale
d
pretty
drinkable
tasty
and
little
trace
of
alcohol
i
think
that
one
25oz
bottle
is
enough
for
one
sitting
but
if
i
had
started
earlier
and
had
a
larger
appetite
i
could
have
more
d
oh
yeah
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
do
90
of
stouts
though
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
was
expecting
a
higher
level
of
sweetness
and
a
slightly
more
viscous
body
not
bad
in
the
drinkability
department
this
is
not
so
thick
or
sweet
that
it
couldnt
be
sessionable
should
go
well
with
any
dessert
d
not
that
great
of
a
beer
fell
short
of
all
my
expectations
and
wasnt
that
pleasant
to
drink
it
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
bitter
water
with
some
chocolate
pretty
nice
bottle
i
think
it
would
be
well
paired
as
dessert
with
christmas
fruitcake
or
with
some
game
with
some
kind
of
fruit
i
recommend
giving
a
good
space
between
sips
because
the
aftertaste
evolves
beautifully
ive
walked
by
this
beer
several
times
in
various
grocery
stores
and
flirted
with
the
idea
buying
it
i
finally
received
it
over
christmas
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
incredibly
disappointed
it
could
be
that
this
particular
unit
that
i
tried
was
old
and
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
new
seasons
for
too
long
but
somehow
i
doubt
that
the
disappointment
began
with
very
unimpressive
foamy
head
in
that
there
was
very
little
of
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
reminded
me
of
the
smell
of
rubber
dirty
car
tires
the
taste
overall
was
drinkable
but
very
unimpressive
nothing
creamy
about
it
in
fact
from
the
start
this
beer
is
considerably
overcarbonated
however
at
the
end
when
the
carbonation
was
significantly
less
which
revealed
a
flavors
that
i
can
only
describe
as
subpar
and
actually
quite
unpleasant
resist
the
temptation
and
avoid
is
what
i
tell
my
friends
about
this
beer
this
was
an
ok
drink
for
me
i
wasnt
wowed
by
it
but
it
also
wasnt
bad
at
all
the
bottle
is
not
flashy
but
overall
this
is
worth
a
pick
up
to
try
the
cream
stout
experience
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
ive
walked
past
it
a
few
times
at
the
lcbo
and
finally
picked
one
up
a
fine
stout
and
a
handsome
bottle
as
well
d
really
nice
and
pleasing
to
drink
a
very
solid
restrained
oldfashioned
tasting
beer
in
the
traditional
english
style
overal
a
nice
beer
certainly
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
id
have
this
in
middleupper
of
the
pack
for
me
good
cream
stout
a
little
more
brisk
than
some
the
others
that
ive
had
which
is
good
because
when
it
comes
to
stouts
i
like
a
bitter
roastiness
more
than
a
sweet
maltiness
but
thats
me
and
i
keeps
it
reals
had
a
fresher
bottle
and
it
comes
out
like
a
export
stout
expanded
in
time
it
has
a
very
mild
earth
very
rich
vanilla
bean
and
grape
esters
the
earth
is
pure
toasted
malt
of
nougat
and
coffee
the
earth
is
delicate
but
prevalent
doesnt
not
subside
in
comparison
to
the
beer
this
is
much
brought
about
with
the
light
but
fluffy
body
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
had
a
deep
black
body
that
shines
with
dark
ruby
brilliance
when
backlit
the
tan
foam
piled
atop
it
doesnt
last
very
long
but
leaves
a
nice
sticky
lace
behind
as
it
goes
smells
of
milk
chocolate
nuts
and
a
hint
of
breakfast
roast
coffee
underneath
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
fruit
finishing
with
black
coffee
very
mild
acidity
its
a
little
roastier
on
the
tongue
than
it
seems
in
the
nose
roasted
bitterness
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
feels
soft
and
slick
balanced
and
flavourful
its
very
easy
to
like
this
stout
a
lot
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
curling
up
with
on
a
winters
night
especially
around
the
holiday
season
pours
opaque
with
cinnamon
head
that
dissipates
quickly

creamy
in

lightmedium

with
refreshing
traits
highly
quaffable
and
a
good
milk
stout
one
worth
checking
out
decent
aroma
a
bit
of
the
lactose
malts
appearance
is
splendid
thick
and
creamy

no
real

though
black

with
some
ruby
highlights
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
taste
is
a
bit
milky
bitter
and
a
great
chocolate
malt
aspect
the
feel
is
a
bit
thick
and
overcarbonated
but
the
only
real
complaint
is
the
carbonation
level
i
think
it
is
fine
with
this
body
the
aftertaste
is
perfectly
bittersweet
really
is
an
excellent
sessioning
beer
taste
is
sweet
and
roasty
with
wellbalanced
hop
bitterness
adding
just
enough
flavor
for
this
dark
wonder
mouth
is
smooth
to
the
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
winter
is
coming
and
this
is
a
highly
recommended
sweet
stout
for
those
cold
nebraska
nights
notes
im
drinking
this
stuff
after
spending
the
last
week
drinking
peche
mortel
and
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
so
i
think
the
bar
got
set
pretty
high
and
this
stuff
makes
me
feel
like
another
bottle
sometime
it
was
interesting
and
approachable
and
just
overall
a
really
solid
beer
overall
a
really
solid
brew
probably
the
least
sweet
milk
stout
i
have
hadthat
just
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
most
to
me
this
went
down
real
easy
d
no
complaints
here
as
advertised
one
stellar
creamy
stout
indeed
not
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beers
so
this
will
probably
be
my
last
but
it
will
fade
with
fond
memories
d
very
balanced
and
a
very
good
stout
beer
poured
with
a
thick
carmel
head
that
was
relatively
slow
to
dissipate
the
color
of
black
coffee
this
beer
was
beautiful
when
freshly
poured
and
aromatic
too
this
in
not
an
overwhelmingly
sweet
cream
stout
it
has
a
nice
balanced
body
and
pleasant
aftertaste
although
somewhat
watery
i
have
sampled
this
beer
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
in
three
states
nynjpa
and
found
that
there
was
some
inconsistency
amongst
the
bottles
mainly
that
some
possessed
the
watery
feel
while
others
did
not
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
if
there
was
an
award
for
best
bottles
this
brewery
would
prob
get
55
for
their
originalitythe
beer
pours
a
dark

that
could

alot

oelergud
d
a
very
nice

the
sweetness

the
dry
irish
ones

this
is
a

i
plan
on
drinking
again
pours
a
cola
color
with
two
inches
of
light
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
sheets
of

first
appear
before
receding
to
spotty
lacing
has
an
aroma
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
oh
yea
those
lovely
english
hops
the
flavor
is
not
at
all
sweet
for
a
socalled
sweet
stout
has
flavors
of
roasted
malt
moca
charcoal
and
finishes
with
some
herbal
and
floral
hop
flavors
definate
hop
bitterness
is
noted
as
well
as
some
alcohol
warmth
the
body
is
not
that
substantial
i
would
say
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
carbonation
is
low
so
the
beer
has
a
soft
texture
lacks
the
body
to
give
a
good
creamy
stout
feel
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
that
packs
some
serious
english
hop
action
if
i
could
be
assured
of
getting
this
fresh
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
a
bit
on
the
edge
of
actually
being
a
milksweet
stout
at
least
compared
to
ones
i
have
had
in
the
past
either
way
i
am
disappointed
absolutely
pitch
black
thick
tan
head
which
is
slow
to
dissipate
and
leaves
generous
lacing
all
the
way
down
my
pint
glass
almost
looks
too
good
to
drink
aroma
is
delicious
roasted
malts
coffee
and
general
stoutiness
flavor
and
mouthfeel
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
smooth
creamy
roasty
malty
yummy
i
could
drink
this
all
day
possibly
my
new
favorite
stout
but
i
have
three
more
to
try
today
d
a
fantastic
cream
stout
easily
the
best
and
most
flavorful
i
have
ever
had
i
will
be
picking
this
up
many
more
times
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
smoked
meet
prunes
and
sweet
malt
clinging
to
the
palate
pours
deep
dark
brown
with
light
amber
hues
noticeable
on
the
sides
very
thin
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
cream
and
roasted
malts
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
which
harbors
a
delicate
sweet
cream
flavor
against
a
deep
roasted
malt
backdrop
finishes
lightly
hopy
along
with
burnt
coffee
and
earthy
notes
making
their
way
forward
as
well
d
i
like
this
one
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
drinks
really
easily
not
your
biggest
stout
though
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
that
either
mouthfeeldrinkability
body
was
a
bit
thin
but
that
only
makes
it
more
drinkable
this
is
a
stout
you
can
drink
in
hot
summer
weather
like
today
90
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
due
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
pretty
solid
drinking
beer
and
fairly
smooth
worth
a
shot
if
you
get
the
chance
rich
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
overrall
milk
stout
a
good
brew
that
was
well
worth
trying
but
its
calling
itself
a
cream
stout
and
if
i
wanted
dark
fruit
id
have
cracked
the
bottle
of
old
rasputin
ive
got
in
the
fridge
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
stout
like
this
and
it
sure
was
a
pleasure
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
grainy
or
bubbly
maybe
the
light
flavors
really
make
this
a
drinkable
beer
though
wonderfully
drinkable
could
enjoy
this
any
time
of
day
any
time
of
year
highly
recommend
this
one
t
smooth
almost
subdue
flavor
starts
with
a
sweet
creamyness
followed
by
a
small
hop
bit
and
finishies
with
a
well
roasted
malt
another
great
milksweet
stout
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
st
peters
cream
stout
but
the
first
time
ive
been
able
to
review
it
nonetheless
each
time
has
been
quite
enjoyable
decently
complex
stout
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
treat
to
drink
i
can
definitely
recommend
this
beer
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
stout
very
smooth
feel
with
a
nice
creaminess
nice
full
body
very
good
beer
classic
gladihadit
case
for
me
its
a
nice
stout
pleasant
characters
and
a
smoothness
that
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the
interest
to
make
it
truly
brilliant
unfortunately
d
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
british
for
my
tastes
notes
from
and
tasted
on
42309
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
stout
thats
mild
but
not
too
mild
and
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
a
pleasant
drinking
stout
md
nice
and
sticky
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
stout
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
makes
this
one
drinkable
not
that
i
would
want
to
slam
a
bunch
of
them
but
hey
its
a
stout
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
and
it
will
probably
be
my
standby
nonimperial
stout
this
is
a
solid
english
stout
though
some
of
the
little
nuisances
make
it
go
down
the
hatch
a
little
slower
poured
nicely
into
a
20
ounce
pint
glass
so
i
could
get
the
whole
beer
in
there
i
didnt
chill
it
down
too
much
and
i
was
rewarded
with
a
nice
tan
creamy
head
that
stayed
throughout
chocolate
and
caramel
aromas
accompanied
by
a
sweet
molasses
a
slight
notice
of
hops
in
the
back
keeps
this
beer
from
being
too
sweet
a
very
well
balanced
cream
stout
sorta
subtle
and
lets
you
know
that
someone
really
took
the
time
to
make
this
balanced
a
creamy
texture
and
the
maltiness
of
it
sticks
to
your
lips
after
each
sip
a
must
try
if
you
like
stouts
drinkability
is
impressive
an
exceptional
combination
of
strong
flavors
a
nice
light
creaminess
a
solid
mouthfeel
and
a
fairly
nice
looking
brew
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
as
a
solid
stout
and
a
fair
example
of
a
cream
stout
definitely
worth
having
again
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
so
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
in
terms
of
heaviness
for
a
cream
stout
but
it
seems
like
it
gives
you
a
buzz
easily
is
it
really
just
6
5
overall
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
one
but
having
a
second
one
right
afterwards
isnt
of
interest
to
me
one
of
my
favorites
beers
have
a
black
color
putting
it
against
the
light
theres
a
reddish
very
dark
color
thefoam
is
creamy
and
abundant
looks
like
ice
cream
with
coke
the
smell
have
essences
of
prunes
toast
malts
and
blueberries
the
taste
is
exquisite
its
smooth
bitter
with
some
coffee
chocolate
and
blueberries
the
mouthfeel
is
like
american
coffee
have
a
great
body
a
creamy
consistency
and
decent
level
of
alcohol
very
good
to
accompany
cookies
and
also
to
take
it
alone
if
i
was
an
english
priest
i
would
always
drink
this
beer
still
a
drinkable
beer
though
goes
down
smooth
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
might
get
this
once
in
a
while
as
something
different
but
overall
i
have
other
milk
or
cream
stouts
id
rather
be
drinking
a
drinkable
stout
i
enjoyed
this
beer
dont
need
to
have
one
again
right
away
but
would
enjoy
it
if
i
did
drinkability
smokyroasty
flavor
is
overdone
and
makes
this
one
difficult
to
drink
at
first
that
flavor
eases
up
a
bit
with
time
and
gives
way
to
sweeter
flowerier
notes
still
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
seems
to
be
flavored
similar
to
an
irish
dry
stout
d
very
pleased
with
this
beer
as
reflected
in
my
scoring
not
a
super
expensive
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
what
an
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
pours
a
nice
dark
almost
black
mahogany
with
a
thin
caramel
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
molasses
while
others
here
have
complained
that
this
beer
is
not
especially
complex
i
would
agree
to
a
point
while
it
might
not
be
the
most
complex
beer
i
found
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
delicious
flavor
i
could
drink
many
of
these
happily
and
i
think
i
will
d
goes
down
smooth
but
probably
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
overall
its
a
good
stout
thats
definitely
worth
adding
to
your
regular
selections
drinkability
not
my
every
day
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
glad
i
had
someone
to
split
it
with
as
im
not
sure
i
wouldve
drank
the
whole
thing
in
one
sitting
overall
this
does
more
of
the
stout
and
less
of
the
cream
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
cream
stouts
d
drinkable
but
certainly
needed
to
be
throw
into
a
mix
i
dont
know
that
i
could
put
more
than
one
down
in
a
night
as
i
tend
to
like
to
jump
around
it
is
very
good
and
should
be
tried
by
any
stout
lover
ill
go
for
one
again
in
the
future
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
many
flavors
dance
across
the
tongue
bitter
chocolate
raisins
smoked
malt
and
coffee
beans
smooth
creamy
and
nicely
balanced
with
a
toasty
malt
and
english
hop
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
the
next
time
i
have
it
pours
a
small
head
on
a
black
body
and
minimal
lace
very
thick
malt
smell
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
large
amount
of
cocoa
malt
for
a
sweetness
that
is
always
on
the
palate
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
also
the
beer
is
balanced
with
roasted
and
some
coffee
malt
for
a
pleasantly
dry
backbite
although
it
is
a
little
too
much
i
wish
the
sweetness
and
creaminess
could
just
taper
off
on
the
backend
rather
than
be
overpowered
a
great
session
beer
this
brew
is
a
very
good
offering
from
st
peters
if
i
had
to
log
a
complaint
it
would
be
that
this
stout
is
too
thin
and
less
of
a
cream
offering
however
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
despite
being

as
i
explore
more
and
more
of
the
styles

like
i
stumbled
upon
this
little
gem
well
balanced
and
flavorful
definitely
a
hit
nose
is
smoky
and
malty
distinctly
toasty
or
burned
to
taste
dominated
by
malts
with
a
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
this
is
offset
somewhat
by
a
hint
of
creaminess
most
of
the
presence
of
this
beerseems
to
be
in
its
mouthfeel
after
that
a
fairly
average
stout
well
made
but
not
remarkable
dark
brown
out
of
a
pint
bottle
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
was
nice
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
started
out
a
very
nice
chocolate
but
after
a
few
sips
the
bitterness
increased
and
it
had
a
hint
of
bitter
through
the
rest
on
average
this
beer
was
average
not
bad
but
there
are
others
id
rather
drink
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
gave
me
one
either
d
good
beer
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
if
you
want
something
different
than
this
would
be
a
good
pick
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brownblack
with
the
consistency
of
a
watery
stout
the
smell
is
predominantly
smoky
which
flows
into
the
taste
the
taste
is
the
sharp
bitter
smoky
taste
noted
previously
but
has
a
bit
of
light
fruity
characteristics
with
a
bit
of
a
plum
and
cherry
does
not
have
enough
smoothness
for
a
cream
stout
and
the
finish
is
a
good
indicator
of
this
with
a
slightly
sour
smoky
flavor
to
the
tongue
its
not
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
d
the
bottle
is
a
goner
no
problems
with
drinkability

want
more
than

a

up
again

normally
hate

every

then
you
get

make

it
makes
you
wonder
why
the

are
so
bad
d
definitely
not
a
standout
in
the
cream

class
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down

either

alone
you
gotta
love
their

while
more

i
still
love
popping
into

i
first
discovered

now
as

you
might
expect
it
has

a
nice

that
is
easy
to
keep
drinking
there
is
a
nice

with

although

extraordinarily
complex
resinous
hop
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
that
reminded
me
more
of
an

than
a

the

was
best
up

around

the

is
weak

fades
into

the
aroma
is
odd
something
like

sour

that
sour
cream
thing
had
me
concerned
though
the
sweetness
is
definitely
here
and
provides
for
a

for
the

surprisingly
amazing
at

five
words
lovely
sampling
from

i

this

one
of
my
favourites

with

settles
into

as
very
dark

with

aroma
is

right
off

with
roasted

chocolate
flavor

sweet
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
a
nice
roastiness
to
balance
out
the

mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium

for
a
higher
abv
milk
stout
overall
a
great
and
unique
take
on
the
style
not
too
sweet
very
nice
outstanding
body
great
aroma
with
a
chocolate
finish
that
is
not
too
strong
rather
sweet
good
bit
of
semi
artificial
vanilla
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
good
beer
but
somewhat
sweet
i
do
like
the
high
abv
on

in
a
tulip
glass
in
dallas
at
blind
butcher
tartar
and
jalapeño
sausage
get
some
o
like
drinking
a
fizzy
chocolatecovered
berry
this
is
a
stout
that
i
have
failed
to
find
anyone
to
dislike
even
if
they
are
the
light
lager
types
that
doesnt
mean
they
can
drink
2
of
them
but
everyone
agrees
the
flavor
is
like
a
chocolate
bar
made
love
to
a
coffee
bean
then
their
child
grew
up
to
make
love
to
a
world
class
stout
and
now
we
have
this
11
for
a
4pack
hurts
but
its
really
priced
fairly
as
advertised
the
temptress
has
some
nice
lactose
and
vanilla
notes
going
on
i
found
the
bitterness
somewhat
distracting
and
it
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
is
bad
at
all
this
is
a
really
great
milk
stout
and
im
not
what
you
call
a
milk
stout
fan
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
at
meddlesome
moth
in
dallas
nitro
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
with
this
stout
o
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
so
glad
to
have
it
readily
available
on
the
shelves
in
my
hometown
silky
feel
chocolate
and
caramel
taste

ive
ever
had
this

fill
you
up
and
leave
you
with
a
headache
in
the
morning
do
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
highlight
for
me
was
the
creamy
mouthfeel
thats
how
all
stouts
oughta
be
thanks
kojevergas
smooth
best
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
smooth
sweet
drinkable
and
just
downright
delicious
for
a
stout
low
b
this
is
one
of
the
creamiest
milk
stouts
ive
ever
had
it
was
very
good
almost
tasted
like
whoppers
or
a
malted
milk
shake
rich
flavor
and
very
delicious
tmo
really
comes
alive
in
your
mouth
roasted
milk
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
burnt
really
well
done
super
tarty
big
bold
flavor
full
bodied
and
chewy
but
super
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
wonderful
drinking
overall
i
love
it
this
is
a
great
milkstout
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
proud
of
my
homeland
for
producing
such
a
wonderful
beer
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
its
certainly
not
the
best
milk
stout
ive
had
i
still
rank
beachwoods
udder
love
and
left
hands
nitro
the
two
best
that
ive
had
still
a
decent
beer
cheers
not
a
style
i
typically
seek
out
but
this
is
wonderfully
crafted
and
really
interesting
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
look
is
absolute
black
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
settles
into
thick
cream
and
stubborn
lacing
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
wallop
of
chocolate
up
front
then
recedes
into
a
woody
dry
finish
very
nice
indeed
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
great
deep
flavor
without
being
as
acidic
as
some
beers
malted
this
darkly
can
be
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
promises
a
great
time
besides
who
cant
love
a
beer
that
says
right
on
the
bottle
that
it
pairs
well
with
sin
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
just
missing
on
some
parts
for
me
the
finish
is
a
little
to
dry
and
missing
some
of
the
creaminess
i
was
hoping
for
id
like
a
bottle
date
as
well
you
dont
see
imperial
milk
stouts
all
the
time
and
this
is
a
good
representation
i
enjoyed
it
o
this
is
the
first
imperial
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
and
its
inspiring
me
to
look
for
more
i
love
how
its
sweet
but
not
overly
syrupy
and
has
enough
bitter
zing
to
finish
cleanly
o
yum
a
great
contrast
of
very
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
then
the
crisp
bitter
burnt
toast
flavors
in
the
finish
great
milk
stout
medium
mouthfeel
medium
carb
o
im
not
one
for
the
milk
stouts
but
this
is
very
pleasant
i
love
the
relaxing
flavor
and
the
creamy
mouth
feel
this
beer
definitely
deserves
its
rating
cheers
o
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
oily
smooth
with
creamy
carbonation
great
with
dark
chocolate
coffee
beans
with
this
tasting
this
is
the
type
of
imperial
milk
stout
i
like
im
only
surprised
i
didnt
seek
it
out
earlier
especially
given
i
reside
in
the
town
in
which
the
brewery
is
based
a
delicious
beer
though
the
finish
is
not
quite
there
o
nice
beer
to
start
the
night
out
while
visiting
my
son
in
texas
thought
i
would
try
a
few
beers
from
the
state
while
i
am
here
o
as
this
got
to
proper
serving
temperature
this
one
shined
much
more
big
milk
chocolate
with
some
caramel
flavors
and
a
nice
aftertaste
overy
tasty
nice
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
beer
has
some
wonderfully
sweet
characteristics
but
the
booze
is
a
little
out
of
place
and
i
feel
like
the
char
hits
the
palate
too
hard
it
just
distracts
from
the
marshmallowy
vanilla
goodness
that
i
do
not
want
to
go
away
the
lacto
also
makes
for
a
really
nice
feel
on
the
tongue
i
would
love
to
put
some
age
on
this
beer
and
see
what
happens
lots
of
milk
chocolate
up
front
quite
sweet
lots
of
cocoa
which
lasts
through
the
aftertaste
rich
body
more
than
the
irish
dry
stouts
low
carbonation
this
could
be
be
chocolate
porter
as
there
are
no
burnt
elements
still
its
a
wonderfully
flavorful
beer
to
seek
out
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
it
avoids
the
one
dimensional
sweet
aspect
of
many
milk
stouts
and
is
really
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
overall
very
good
beer
but
i
do
prefer
it
on
nitro
compared
to
the
bottle
definitely
a
great
cold
weather
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
summary
super
good
one
of
the
better
texas
offerings
ive
had
this
is
a
fantastic
milk
stout
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
black
with
amber
edges
in
the
light
thin
mocha
head
that
disappears
quick
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
as
the
glass
goes
down
smells
of
mild
alcohol
a
little
coffee
and
cream
with
a
touch
of
caramel
very
nice
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
sugar
vanilla
and
some
caramel
but
with
all
that
said
its
not
overly
sweet
at
all
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
good
carb
overall
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
im
very
happy
to
see
coming
out
of
texas
especially
the
style
due
to
the
lack
of
here
9
994
packs
make
this
beer
quite
a
deal
well
done
lakewood
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
milk
stouts
in
general
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
most
enjoyable
one
ive
had
yet
still
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
style
but
i
could
drink
the
temptress
every
once
in
a
while
if
it
were
available
to
me
o
too
much
roasted
malts
in
this
for
my
liking
but
a
very
well
balanced
beer
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
or
coffee
version
as
i
think
it
would
balance
the
malt
bill
and
compliment
the
flavors
very
well
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
but
the
combination
of
imperial
and
milk
stout
suggested
a
beer
that
just
couldnt
miss
although
this
doesnt
blow
me
away
its
certainly
a
worthwhile
offering
try
it
i
understand
that
a
milksweet
stout
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
but
this
is
a
bit
much
its
literally
more
sugary
than
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
there
is
some
nice
depth
to
the
malts
and
some
roast
but
overall
this
is
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
like
the
aroma
starts
out
with
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
lingering
sweet
and
roasty
notes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
that
is
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
overall
very
sold
milk
stout
i
could
easily
have
another
atmosphere
is
good
dark
hue
nice
bubbly
head
and
very
little
lacing
nose
is
simple
and
subtle
combination
of
coffee
malt
peat
and
some
sweet
tones
syrupy
roasted
malt
flavor
pungent
peatiness
and
some
sweetness
for
balance
right
in
the
middle
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
this
is
an
extremely
solid
milk
stout
the
lactose
is
light
and
subtle
which
i
really
prefer
this
does
have
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
char
and
the
sweetness
with
just
enough
vanilla
well
played
tx
well
played
o
a
solid
brew
and
a
nice
milk
stout
theres
a
really
nice
silky
sweet
chocolate
milk
quality
to
this
beer
theres
a
hint
of
sour
lacto
that
can
at
time
be
a
bit
surprising
on
the
nose
but
works
very
well
with
the
taste
o
very
drinkable
despite
the
9
1
abv
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
for
such
a
new
brewery
love
to
see
a
texas
brewery
making
stouts
this
is
an
enjoyable
imperial
milk
stout
i
am
enjoying
sipping
on
this
though
the
tinny
flavor
is
a
bit
off
putting
for
me
maybe
just
variation
from
bottle
to
bottle
something
worth
a
try
and
i
will
be
sure
to
finish
the
four
pack
without
a
problem
very
well
done
tasty
milk
stout
drinkable
no
real
booziness
this
is
an
interesting
one
i
am
having
a
tough
time
albeit
an
enjoyable
one
picking
out
the
individual
characteristics
of
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
brew
however
there
is
one
thing
that
stands
out
it
is
excellent
i
just
dont
know
why
and
its
not
just
the
gratuitous
abv
the
feel
of
this
drink
is
so
smooth
and
creamy
its
rather
incredible
the
taste
is
excellent
maybe
that
is
a
roasted
chocolate
flavor
i
just
cant
tell
the
key
thing
is
that
whatever
components
are
in
this
it
makes
an
allaround
wellmixed
overlyenjoyable
brew
this
is
now
my
favorite
milk
stout
i
will
get
this
again
as
soon
as
a
friend
from
dallas
brings
it
to
me
once
more
stouts
not
being
my
bag
i
still
can
recognize
the
greatness
in
this
beer
lots
of
alcohol
though
so
for
me
it
may
always
be
a
1
or
2beer
session
at
most
something
to
savor
from
time
to
time
not
to
throw
down
at
a
bbq
entirely
too
sweet
overall
dial
back
the
lactose
a
touch
and
it
would
be
a
solid
milk
stout
very
solid
o
overall
a
great
imperial
milk
stout
while
i
cant
say
i
have
had
many
i
have
had
my
fair
share
of
stouts
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
if
it
were
available
in
jersey
i
can
see
me
drinking
this
for
desert
even
in
the
warmer
weather
cheers
love
this
o
other
than
the
disappointing
lack
of
nose
and
the
slightly
contrary
flavors
this
beer
is
pretty
great
it
could
use
a
little
balance
and
i
sure
wish
i
could
smell
this
thing
but
all
around
it
delivers
some
complexity
some
body
and
for
the
price
it
does
its
job
well
do
very
drinkable
this
is
an
outstanding
offering
from
a
young
brewery
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
is
definitely
better
seriously
beergasm
but
the
regular
version
is
still
excellent
taste
starts
with
chocolate
and
mild
roast
followed
up
with
a
surprising
amount
of
grassy
hop
the
finish
is
long
and
dusty
with
the
alcohol
finally
making
its
presence
known
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
the
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
the
body
is
silky
smooth
it
is
not
as
heavy
and
sweet
as
i
thought
from
the
aroma
but
it
is
more
than
enough
to
compliment
a
8
5
abv
this
is
quite
a
tasty
treat
i
am
looking
forward
to
getting
some
more
of
this
on
my
next
trip
up
to
the
metroplex
not
the
actual
temptress
but
the
bourbon
barrel
temptress
had
a
glass
at
the
brewery
on
12222012
this
was
a
wonderful
stout
must
admit
that
the
entire
tasting
experience
was
very
nice
but
the
temptress
either
aged
in
a
bourbon
barrel
or
not
was
wonderful
while
this
effort
by
the
fledgling
lakewood
brewing
co
in
garland
is
not
the
best
imperial
russian
stout
i
have
had
it
certainly
is
distinct
and
holds
its
own
against
the
top
us
brews
in
this
style
i
have
tried
and
rate
highly
north
coast
brewery
fort
bragg
ca
etc
overall
a
very
impressive
imperial
stout
that
brings
a
rich
chocolate
flavor
with
a
coffee
twist
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nitroinduced
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
expected
the
flavor
features
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
some
light
smoke
as
well
as
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
notes
slick
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
its
an
alright
beer
but
certainly
leaves
me
wanting
more
specifically
more
chocolate
caramel
coffee
lots
of
potential
but
ultimately
falls
a
bit
flatshort
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
thin
almost
black
coloring
with
no
head
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
hints
of
cream
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
decently
balanced
aromas
with
hints
of
smoke
in
there
too
flavors
are
roasted
forward
with
a
sweet
blend
of
cream
and
caramel
to
follow
the
backbone
is
bitter
roasted
coffee
supporting
all
the
sweetness
and
making
this
a
layered
experience
on
the
palate
fairly
smooth
light
dry
bodied
with
a
sweet
cream
and
caramelchocolate
mocha
aftertaste
the
finish
has
a
subtle
lactose
linger
on
a
dry
feel
not
bad
i
want
to
like
this
almost
no
aroma
taste
is
lactose
there
is
a
light
touch
of
dark
cacao
and
some
stinky
oats
light
almost
watery
mouthfeel
ughh
keep
up
the
good
saison
work
very
thin
feel
and
taste
a
bit
of
a
letdown
i
thought
it
was
very
tasty
not
a
bomb
but
great
for
the
price
its
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
any
fan
of
a
good
milk
stout
is
sure
to
enjoy
this
lightly
sour
notes
in
flavor
perhaps
their
rogue
yeast
has
had
a
hand
on
the
sweet
side

underattenuated
with

had
it
on
draft
and
it
was
just
kind
of
onenote
really
was
hoping
for
more
out
of
it
it
really
doesnt
come
off
like
a
milk
stout
so
much
which
probably
explains
my
enjoyment
of
it
is
probably
far
higher
than
expected
decent
brew
but
the
chocolate
angle
is
a
little
indistinct
and
buried
too
but
theres
plenty
of
goodness
here
in
a
stout
market
dominated
by
russian
imperials
and
bourbonbarrel
aged
monstrosities
this
sessionable
milk
stout
is
a
pleasant
reminder
that
beer
even
from
the
latest
and
greatest
breweries
can
still
be
simple
and
delicious
the
worst
that
ive
had
from
prairie
thin
undercarbonated
with
no
discernable
chocolate
fail
o
just
not
hitting
on
all
cylinders
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
often
when
compared
to
other
milk
stouts
i
am
surprised
people
are
so
down
on
this
one
usually
it
is
me
who
knocks
the
over
hyped
prairie
stuff
not
the
other
way
around
i
like
this
for
being
a
little
different
and
while
i
dont
think
its
their
best
work
its
certainly
quality
beer
what
i
like
about
it
is
the
milk
stout
part
its
different
in
that
while
you
can
taste
the
lactose
it
isnt
all
that
sweet
in
fact
its
quite
dry
uncommon
for
the
style
to
have
the
flavor
there
but
have
it
dry
out
like
that
in
the
finish
i
credit
a
dusty
cocoa
type
malt
unsweetened
bakers
chocolate
notes
and
a
very
hearty
yeast
strain
for
this
phenomenon
i
am
used
to
crazy
yeast
in
their
beer
and
although
this
isnt
crazy
in
the
usual
funked
out
barny
sense
of
the
term
its
crazy
because
of
its
completeness
even
in
a
sweet
stout
style
i
like
the
frothy
feel
and
all
the
body
and
i
like
that
its
gone
on
the
swallow
a
cool
release
for
spring
too
as
we
are
now
moving
away
form
stout
season
but
this
one
seems
to
fit
prolonging
the
seasonality
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
well
done
this
time
around
from
prairie
thanks
for
making
something
a
little
out
of
your
comfort
zone
personally
i
felt
that
this
beer
is
underrated
as
a
sucker
for
stouts
i
picked
up
a
bottle
despite
the
subpar
ratings
poured
black
with
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
i
picked
up
a
little
malt
on
the
nose
but
more
of
the
lactose
came
through
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
very
easy
drinking
i
loved
it
it
was
extremely
smooth
and
sweet
tan
head
with
a
dark
complex
wow
i
really
like
this
beer
pours
a
mocha
head
of
creamy
thick
foam
that
lasts
on
an
opaque
burnt
caramel
dark
brown
body
leaves
sheets
of
shimmering
lace
as
you
drink
nose
is
roasty
milky
sweet
cream
on
roasted
malts
leather
cocoa
powder
a
nice
light
chocolate
scent
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
big
roasty
malt
that
is
so
smooth
and
luscious
it
tiptoes
up
to
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
that
roast
but
stays
shy
a
silken
caramel
seems
to
come
out
of
nowhere
and
glide
over
the
back
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
silken
creamy
soft
medium
full
and
a
touch
chewy
at
times
finish
is
sweet
cream
and
roasted
grains
with
chocolate
on
top
overall
really
disappointed
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
was
slat
watery
and
uninspiring
however
the
aroma
was
pretty
solid
ill
revise
my
review
if
my
next
bottle
is
better
o
aside
from
prairies
most
famous
and
hyped
beers
ive
been
pretty
disappointed
with
their
more
normal
offerings
i
dont
know
that
ill
be
paying
the
hefty
price
for
many
more
of
their
beers
after
feeling
like
i
spent
too
much
on
yet
another
cool
looking
well
marketed

a

disappointed

not
gonna
lie
seemingly
full
but
reasonably
so
to
the
initial
taste
its
waning
memories
are
dry
toasty
and
roasty
with
just
enough
malt
support
to
resist
ash
roastderived
astringency
or
harsh
bitterness
echoes
of
bakers
chocolate
and
coffee
extend
into
aftertaste
and
heighten
my
cravings
for
blackened

chicken
wings
really
disappointed
i
almost
want
to
blame
the
growler
but
it
popped
with
a
big
initial
tan
head
and
i
shop
at
premium
draught
regularly
and
have
never
had
any
issues
this
just
seems
poorly
made
cant
believe
i
paid
3
for
a
12oz
i
would
dump
this
if
it
was
homebrew
overall
a
decent
milk
stout
the
cocoa
for
being
from
prairie
i
was
hoping
for
more
yet
it
was
still
a
perfectly
fine
milk
stout
i
would
be
interested
to
see
this
one
with
some
coffee
in
it
tastemilk
chocolatecoffee
a
bit
thinbodied
an
ok
stout
o
i
was
expecting
more
but
this
disappointed
i
paid
4
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
thats
24
a
sixpack
way
overpriced
i
did
not
get
the
chocolate
i
was
expecting
but
its
okay
the
price
just
throws
me
off
this
should
run
about
910
a
sixpack
no
more
theres
better
or
equal
milk
stouts
on
the
market
for
this
price
compared
to
others
its
just
alright
but
it
is
decent
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
for
sure
decent
brew
decent
taste
not
the
best
of
the
milk
chocolate
stouts
but
not
bad
either
id
grab
another
one
of
these
if
the
price
was
right
a
good
milk
stout
but
defiantly
not
one
of
the
best
from
prairie
chocolate
feel
that
sticks
but
very
light
meant
to
be
a
refresher
tastes
good
light
milky
heavy
cacao
presence
with
linger
nothing
tastes
right
here
theres
a
lack
of
flavor
besides
a
slight
tartness
the
mouthfeels
extremely
thin
something
went
wrong
in
the
brewing
process
and
shame
on
prairie
for
dropping
it
on
their
customers
pours
black
with
a
slight
khaki
head
that
totally
recedes
before
i
get
around
to
taking
my
first
sip
aroma
is
decent
sweet
and
slightly
roasty
with
lactose
sugars
milk
chocolate
and
some
caramel
probably
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
flavor
tastes
like
water
with
milk
chocolate
mixed
in
mouthfeel
is
offensively
thin
and
prickly
if
the
watered
down
flavor
didnt
kill
the
beer
this
horrible
mouthfeel
certainly
would
overall
i
dont
know
what
happened
here
but
this
one
is
no
good
my
impression
is
that
this
is
the
product
of
bad
brewing
not
a
bad
recipe
it
will
be
a
struggle
to
get
through
this
4
pack
and
2
of
the
bottles
if
not
3
will
likely
be

12

the

with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
pretty
much
no
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
like
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and

taste
is

theres
also
some

flavor
noticeable
too
just
too
much
of
an
artificial
chocolate
flavor
i
liked
this
when
i
first
started
drinking
it
but
unfortunately
it
only
got
worse
after
the
first
sip
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
seems
a

watery
and
thin
to
me
this
isnt
a

at
all
but
i
expect
better
out
of
prairie
however
at
2
99
a
bottle
i
guess
i
shouldnt
complain
too
much
worth
a
try
once
but
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
anytime
soon
overall
o
k
nothing
to
blow
you
away
but
a
decent
stout
nonetheless
d
what
with
the
low
abv
have
at
it
the
the
thick
richness
tend
to
make
me
think
this
is
a
sipper
black
as
a
dark
night
or
dark
knightif
you
will
and
no
light
seeps
through
a
fingernail
of
khaki
covers
the
rim
and
about
a
quarter
of
the
top
odd
blend
of
bitter
roasted
barley
and
sweet
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
complicated
blend
of
bitter
roastedsmoked
barley
and
chocolate
the
body
is
thick
and
somewhat
sticky
i
think
there
might
be
a
trace
of
peppers
or
chilies
as
theres
a
touch
of
heat
this
beer
is
confusing
sweet
or
bitter
pick
one
this
seems
like
bombs
little
underachieiving
brother
every
thing
that
is
right
with
that
is
pretty
much
wrong
with
this
glad
i
got
to
try
it
drinks
easy
but
not
anything
you
would
want
to
stay
on
this
will
work
with
texmex
or
breakfast
better
than
as
a
standalone
beer
very
smooth
and
delicious
always
great
things
from
prairie
plain
boring
some
weird
taste
on
the
back
end
feels
a
little
thin
too
i
am
not
going
to
buy
again
maybe
tried
a
bit
cold
but
still
very
nice
example
very
very
dark
mild
good
beer
not
overpowering
finish
good
try
for
something
different
and
the
price
isnt
a
huge
factor
but
you
might
try
to
get
your
hands
on
one
from
a
friend
before
you
go
all
out
8
bucks
which
is
still
more
than
minimum
wage
in
oklahoma
i
was
disappointed
got
a
nutty
nose
and
some
bitter
chocolate
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
dessert
beer
taste
was
odd
reminiscent
of
coke
with
spices
in
it
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
had
the
sixpoint
peanut
butter
shop
ale
in
2013
and
duclaw
sweet
baby
jesus
porter
in
2014
and
i
really
enjoy
this
peanut
butter
style
of
beer
i
eat
peanut
butter
with
a
spoon
straight
from
the
jar
so
this
is
a
real
treat
combining
two
of
my
favorite
foods
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
like
peanut
butter
its
a
great
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
and
enjoy
the
taste
of
peanut
butter
decent
pb
flavor
not
as
strong
on
chocolate
notes
big
roast
finish
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
of
peanut
butter
cocoa
and
grains
like
reeses
puffs
cereal
the
flavor
starts
with
chocolate
malts
blending
into
peanut
flavor
ending
dry
and
toasty
full
bodied
ale
with
medium
carbonation
almost
creamy
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
i
will
not
actively
seek
it
out
peanut
butter
bomb
and
i
loved
it
i
let
my
wife
try
it
and
it
was
the
first
time
she
has
asked
me
if
i
can
get
some
more
paired
this
with
new
glarus
belgian
red
for
a
faux
pbj
next
time
will
try
with
ng
strawberry
rhubarb
for
the
ultimate
pbj
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
its
a
sweet
desert
stout
not
something
i
would
always
grab
for
when
looking
for
a
stout
but
i
can
imagine
many
times
when
id
want
to
sip
one
of
these
and
experiment
with
pairing
it
to
other
foods
although
i
dont
have
the
same
sweet
memories
from
childhood
towards
peanut
butter
and
how
weird
it
sounds
adding
beer
to
the
picture
i
did
enjoy
this
it
is
an
unusual
combination
that
worked
quite
well
22
oz
bottle
pours
a

layer
of
brown
head
fantastic
and
unique
aroma
lots
of
lacing
chocolate
milk
peanuts
cocoa
caramel
honey
coffee

the
taste

peanut

dark
chocolate
roasted

coffee
and
sweet
lactose
finishes
with
more
chocolate
milk
and
peanut
butter
not
overly
sweet
lightly
carbonated
with
a
light
mouthfeel
somehow
this
beer
works
very
well
overall
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
i
have
ever
had
overall
disappointing
especially
after
so
many
people
said
this
is
a
great
peanut
butter
stout
i
figured
this
being
a
milk
stout
it
might
be
pretty
good
maybe
like
a
peanut
butter
cup
no
such
luck
weak
on
flavor
in
my
opinion
give
me
sweet
baby
jesus
over
this
any
day
very
delicious
wish
it
was
easier
to
come
across
especially
in
new
york
awesome
peanut
butter
aroma
and
taste
go
get
it
wast
expecting
more
but
still
not
bad
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
liked
glass
imperial
pint
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
walking
by
a
coffee
shop
the
flavor
is
chocolatey
peanut
buttery
with
the
standard
stout
coffee
notes
great
beer
overall
o
possibly
the
best
tasting
peanut
butter
stoutporter
that
ive
had
seemed
to
be
some
carbonation
issues
but
other
than
that
very
good
this
brew
has
a
really
good
creamy
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
but
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
not
exclusively
fantastic
look
and
feel
not
a
very
distinct
peanut
butter
flavor
but
a
good
smooth
stout
lots
of
chocolate
peanut
butter
and
boiled
milk
aromas
same
with
the
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
got
in
a
trade
with
raulmondesi
22
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
clear
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
2
finger
fairly
dense
dark
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
huge
milk
chocolate
cocoa
peanut
butter
vanilla
caramel
toast
light
coffee
cream
and
roasted
earthiness
fantastic
aromas
with
great
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
and
peanut
butter
notes
with
great
strength
taste
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
caramel
toast
vanilla
peanut
butter
light
coffee
cream
and
roasted
earthiness
light
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
caramel
toast
vanilla
peanut
butter
light
coffee
and
cream
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
complexity
balance
and
robustness
of
darkroasted
malt
and
peanut
butter
flavors
with
a
good
roasted
bitternesssweetness
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
peanut
butter
flavor
is
not
as
big
as
i
expected
given
the
aromas
but
still
has
good
presence
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
smooth
and
fairly
creamychalky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
no
warming
present
after
the
finish
as
expected
of
5
3
overall
this
is
an
excellent
peanut
butter
milk
stout
all
around
great
robustness
complexity
and
balance
of
darkroasted
malt
and
peanut
butter
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
not
pleasant
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
way
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
did
in
fact
taste
like
peanut
butter
the
peanut
butter
though
was
nicely
integrated
into
the
beer
thank
god
my
buddy
brought
it
over
i
will
drink
this
any
time
i
can
find
it
o
when
you
looked
at
the
label
and
imagine
how
the
adjuncts
all
work
together
you
probably
did
not
have
a
good
first
impression
fortunately
i
am
a
man
with
very
weird
taste
and
weird
outside
the
box
adjuncts
are
of
my
interests
if
done
right
cheers
to
you
belching
beaver
and
all
my
so
cal
traders
that
keep
sending
these
as
extra
if
you
like
peanut
butter
ya
gotta
try
it
aroma
is
strong
peanut
butter
this
is
fantastic
at
first
glance
i
thought
this
sounded
horrible
peanut
butter
flavored
beer
was
i
wrong
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
at
first
taste
and
i
cant
get
enough
it
tastes
best
with
a
steak
or
any
other
meal
with
beef
as
one
review
said
it
tasted
so
good
i
ate
the
bottle
he
wasnt
kidding
absolutely
love
love
love
by
far
one
of
my
top
favorite
5
dark
brown
pour
and
an
off
white
head
smells
like
a
peanut
butter
chocolate
bomb
taste
is
mainly
peanut
butter
and
a
little
chocolate
on
the
back
end
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
very
good
a
little
better
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
more
chocolate
in
there
would
make
it
world
class
in
my
opinion
but
still
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
brownblack
color
stout
with
a
medium
size
offwhite
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
butterscotch
and
hazelnut
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
is
a
bit
surprising
taste
is
also
dominated
by
butterscotch
notes
with
some
hazelnut
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
own
taste
and
i
could
see
the
butterscotch
notes
becoming
over
the
top
if
i
was
to
drink
too
much
of
this
beer
i
love
peanut
butter
and
i
love
beer
two
great
tastes
that
tastes
great
together
peanut
butter
beer
who
knew
i
know
that
this
many
people
say
this
is
not
real
beer
but
i
cant
help
but
love
this
beer
honestly
it
is
amazing
going
down
creamy
mild
and
quite
pleasing
with
a
velvety
peanut
butter
finish
i
really
really
like
it
this
beer
will
become
a
huge
huge
national
hit
ive
had
a
few
peanut
butter
beers
in
my
time
this
one
did
not
impress
to
me
the
peanut
butter
tasted
too
fake
like
that
cheap
halloween
candy
you
used
to
get
as
a
kid
the
mouthfeel
was
a
but
thin
for
me
smell
was
decent
enough
promised
more
than
it
delivered
the
flavor
was
really
nice
very
smooth
full
body
with
acceptable
light
carbonation
o
this
beer
reminds
me
of
2
other
great
desert
beers
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
hardywood
gingerbread
stout
and
southern
tier
creme
broulee
yes
it
is
sweet
but
just
about
the
time
the
flavor
leaves
your
mouth
youre
reaching
for
another
taste
i
have
to
get
more
of
this
beer
smells
delicious
it
also
tastes
delicious
its
like
a
dessert
for
my
taste
buds
sampled
on
tap
at
lth
in
oceanside
pours
a
very
rich
dark
brown
nearly
black
beautiful
fluffy
tan
head
and
salty
roasted
but
nose
taste
is
fudgey
brings
to
mind
a
dq
buster
bar
mouth
feel
is
viscous
and
slick
very
much
dessert
in
a
glass
interesting
for
a
change
of
pace
overall
very
tasty
well
rounded
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
not
overly
sweet
unique
and
delicious
partly
because
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
overrun
by
peanut
butter
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
16
oz
snifter
a
nice
dark
colalike
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
with
almost
no
lacing
afterward
s
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
deep
chocolate
and
toasty
goodness
almost
reminds
me
of
my
sisters
coffee
drinks
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
in
this
one
my
only
complaint
is
the
peanut
butter
is
almost
at
the
back
end
of
the
smell
you
kind
of
have
to
search
for
it
t
very
good
flavor
on
this
peanut
butter
flavor
is
kind
of
masked
on
the
flavor
as
well
hop
bitters
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
do
this
beer
very
well
and
with
a
sweet
finish
it
tastes
very
well
balanced
i
could
definitely
drink
multiple
beers
without
getting
tired
of
this
m
feels
nice
and
thin
but
not
watery
a
very
nice
feel
even
for
a
stout
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
exceptional
stout
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
maybe
multiple
bottles
at
a
time

definitely

more

than
the

strauss
version
which
is
a

but
very
good
overall
this
beer
did
not
taste
as
much
like
peanut
butter
as
other
peanut
butter
beers
i
have
had
wow
amazing
beer
loved
it
rite
when
poured
u
get
the
strong
smell
of
peanut

nice
dark
brownish
color
taste
nice
coffee
peanut

chocolate
not
overpowering
just
rite
thick
smooth
finish
leaves
a
great
aftertaste
of
peanut
butter
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
seek
it
out
if
you
are
in
the
san
diego
area
strong
peanut
butter
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
best
milk
stout
id
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
overall
a
great
beer
exactly
what
it
sounds
like
which
is
great
to
me
really
smells
like
peanut
butter
and
works
really
well
all
around
i
loved
this
highly
recommended
decent
stout
this
is
a
little
lighter
on
mouth
feel
than
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
color
is
black
as
night
this
beer
scores
points
for
its
peanut
butter
nose
and
taste
first
sip
coats
that
palate
with
a
delicious
peanut
buttery
stout
beer
combination
which
continues
throughout
o
im
a
traditionalist
as
far
as
beers
so
i
find
this
beer
gimmicky
but
very
good
if
that
makes
sense
i
love
peanut
butter
and
this
beer
delivers
but
i
feel
like
it
was
added
to
the
beer
instead
of
blending
i
want
a
beer
to
just
naturally
exude
a
peanut
butter
flavor
rather
than
it
being
afterwards
added
and
overbearing
very
bizarre
review
i
know
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
20
oz
firestone
glass
a
dark
black
color
the
smell
was
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
up
front
the
taste
was
peanut
butterchocolate
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
very
original
taste
which
i
have
to
say
i
liked
very
much
some
people
might
say
it
sounds
bad
but
with
these
flavors
blended
together
it
is
really
quite
good
give
it
a
try
at
first
glance
im
giving
this
a
4
im
hearing
there
is
another
peanut
butter
stout
with
a
slight
edge
over
this
one
looking
to
compare
the
two
and
rereview
belching
beaver
has
spurred
the
milk
stout
into
something
that
is
more
than
a
mere
novelty
item
this
wont
be
the
last
time
i
have
a
peanut
butter
milk
stout
from
these
guys
this
is
an
interesting
brew
my
peeps
i
suggest
yall
peep
it
taste
great
to
me
finishes
sweet
buttery
fizzy
and
dissipates
quickly
the
bottle
suggests
using
the
beer
in
an
ice
cream
float
and
i
will
definitely
purchase
it
again
and
try
it
nice
dark
hops
smooth
with
just
a
slight
taste
of
peanut
butter
not
overbearing
where
it
is
gimmicky
a
very
good
choice
for
a
milk
stout
lover
one
in
a
long
line
of
beers
that
smells
like
nirvana
without
the
smoking
gun
tastes
good
still
i
chose
to
have
it
twice
in
the
span
of
one
week
bottle
up
that
smell
beaver
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
is
perfect
a
great
smell
you
get
the
peanut
butter
on
the
nose
and
taste
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
dessert
some
milk
slight
milk
chocolate
notes
as
well
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
would
be
better
if
better
carbonated
o
better
than
the
regular
stout
the
combination
of
peanut
butterchocolategrahamlactose
in
here
balances
out
nicely
its
only
5
3
so
it
drinks
pretty
easy
yet
manages
to
give
a
little
bit
of
stickiness
in
the
mouth
normally
i
dont
like
the
amount
of
fizziness
level
that
this
has
but
it
actually
works
well
to
cut
the
richness
from
the
peanut
butter
chocolate
flavors
great
peanut
nose
taste
has
a
great
peanut
base
not
overly
though
very
thin
bodied
for
a
stout
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
bigger
body
seemed
more
like
a
porter
to
me
really
enjoyed
it
though
would
definitely
have
again
o
outstanding
beer
very
similar
to
big
gruesome
by
spring
house
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
the
moment
i
took
a
whiff
and
my
first
sip
the
world
needs
more
low
octane
delicious
beers
like
this
easy
creamy
mouth
feel
love
the
coffeedark
chocolate
on
the
palate
hint
of
peanut
butter
for
a
peanut
butter
lover
is
magic
ill
be
sad
if
this
beer
ever
disappears
from
the
face
of
the
earth
pours
up
opaque
black
no
head
only
quickly
fading
dark
brown
bubbles
no
lacing
no
problem
aroma
is
big
ol
peanut
butter
big
chocolate
dark
roast
coffee
vanilla
extract
smells
like
a
chocolate
store
and
a
coffee
house
had
a
friggin
baby
taste
is
peanut
butter
as
well
as
all
the
flavors
in
the
nose
full
body
low
low
carbo
making
it
a
smooth
operator
ive
only
had
one
other
peanut
butter
beer
and
that
beer
didnt
even
taste
or
smell
like
peanut
butter
this
brew
is
the
tits
wishing
that
i
lived
in
cali
right
about
now
if
i
ever
have
another
brew
calling
itself
a
peanut
butter
beer
that
doesnt
involve
doughnuts
and
bananas
it
has
a
big
chore
ahead
of
it
to
come
close
to
what
this
here
brew
has
accomplished
on
first
buying
this
i
thought
why
not
great
name
and
heard
heaps
about
so
why
not
but
after
the
look
and
smell
i
thought
im
in
for
something
else
anyway
it
pours
the
darkest
kola
hue
with
a
cappuccino
laced
two
finger
head
and
lacing
here
and
thereon
smell
its
just
like
smelling
a
jar
of
crunchy
peanut
butter
along
with
chocolate
and
nutsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
with
strong
tastes
of
peanut
buttermilk
chocolatecoffee
and
finished
with
a
salty
dryness
and
overall
this
has
to
be
the
most
truest
to
style
of
a
peanut
butter
stout
and
being
a
peanut
butter
fan
i
would
def
drink
this
again
cheers
i
like
this
brew
as
one
to
just
have
a
few
or
a
nice
after
dinner
dessert
beer
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
im
usually
skeptical
of
novelty
or
niche
beers
but
this
one
is
outstanding
beautiful
cola
color
smooth
mouthfeel
and
subtle
profiles
of
roasted
peanuts
coffee
and
caramel
malt
a
great
treat
from
a
great
find
overall
pretty
nice
a
big
time
dessert
beer
nice
peanut
butter
mostly
aroma
but
some
flavor
nice
cookie
dough
and
wafer
biscuit
cookie
caramel
chocolate
and
milk
chocolate
layers
of
candy
bar
and
malted
milk
ball
although
still
maintained
a
decent
milk
stout
and
stouty
beer
base
fairly
enjoyable
although
the
peanut
butter
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
hoped
in
the
flavor
overall
i
find
this
an
excellent
intro
to
the
world
of
milk
stouts
a
great
dessert
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
subdued
but
it
tastes
great
feels
great
and
doesnt
have
the
offensive
bitterness
ive
experienced
with
other
stouts
ill
be
coming
back
for
some
more
overall
this
beer
is
what
you
expect
from
the
name
itself
its
a
good
beer
to
share
with
friends
that
want
to
get
into
craft
beers
if
you
dont
like
peanut
butter
its
not
for
you
cheers
overall
good
medium
bodied
stout
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
so
much
to
prevent
me
from
taking
big
gulps
nuttiness
distinguishes
it
but
does
not
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
a
very
interesting
effort
strong
peanut
butter
taste
and
aroma
with
faint
chocolate
and
bread
flavor
ive
read
comparisons
of
the
flavor
to
that
of
a
reeses
peanut
butter
cup
i
feel
that
this
tastes
more
like
a
liquid
nutter
butter
cookie
this
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
beer
with
a
much
higher
abv
very
tasty
and
i
dont
even
like
peanut
butter
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
peanut
butter
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
powder
and
chocolate
covered
peanut
butter
cup
candy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
comes
across
as
a
bit
astringent
in
the
taste
and
more
balanced
in
the
smell
what
an
absolute
treat
and
underrated
brew
overall
its
okay
ill
try
the
regular
milk
stout
to
see
how
that
is
for
the
5
3
abv
i
suppose
its
quite
what
i
expected
ooverall
its
a
reese
in
a
bottle
awesome
overall
outstanding
stout
worth
a
try
and
a
i
am
not
sure
if
i
like
the
peanut
butter
but
its
a
stout
worth
sharing
and
drinking
again
first
time
for
belchin
beaver
and
i
will
have
to
give
their
other
beers
a
try
d
very
tasty
would
have
more
nut
up
in
your
mouth
it
is
all
about
this
beer
i
cant
say
it
is
a
technically
peanut
butter
flavor
more
just
a
nutty
flavor
interesting
finish
almost
more
like
a
brown
ale
more
carbonation
than
usual
fantastic
smell
of
peanut
i
have
had
it
3
times
now
from
a
22
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
i
am
imagining
it
on
nitro
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
about
half
of
my
beer
after
that
the
taste
got
real
medicineey
on
my
tongue
just
something
wasnt
quite
working
for
me
here
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
milk
stout
for
sure
but
the
peanuts
on
the
taste
are
rather
lacking
wish
the
nose
translated
over
more
t
opens
with
a
mild
roasted
malt
mixed
with
a
touch
of
peanut
butter
light
milk
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
lactose
really
helps
things
out
here
nothing
insane
but
a
pretty
tasty
beer
eventually
there
is
a
little
nutty
taste
slipping
into
the
sweet
burnt
sugar
malt
flavors
quite
an
interesting
brew
you
just
need
to
be
in
the
mood
really
smooth
and
sweet
without
being
sugary
an
undertone
of
bitterness
keeps
it
from
cloying
but
without
raising
much
attention
to
the
subtle
hops
one
of
the
best
flavored
stouts
ive
had
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
milk
stout
but
crazy
not
as
much
peanut
butter
as
i
would
have
helped
but
still
very
very
good
id
have
it
again
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
of
spices
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
with
a
coffee
like
essence
and
a
bit
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
clove
and
spices
round
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
roasted
with
a
yam
like
vegetable
flavor
but
ample
roast
as
it
warms
vanilla
and
cinnamon
roasted
malt
slight
bitterness
full
bodied
and
smooth
pretty
decent
taste
is
gingerbread
fig
grape
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
if
is
an
interesting
beer
but
falls
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
appearance
is
a
black
liquid
with
a
foamy
sudsy
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
just
like
gingerbread
cookies
spicy
ginger
and
sugar
backed
with
a
little
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
firm
malt
structure
and
lots
of
spice
and
ginger
i
a
usually
dubious
of
spicy
gimmick
holiday
brews
this
one
however
is
well
made
and
a
real
treat
enjoyable
and
flavorful
i
have
liked
a
lot
of
the
sam
adams
bigger
stuff
and
this
one
was
also
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
others
a
decent
beer
fun
for
the
holidays
but
not
much
else
a
9
0
tasty
brew
liquid
gingerbread
this
beer
literally
tastes
exactly
as
described
its
got
all
the
traits
of
a
stout
malts
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
lovely
cakey
cookie
breadyness
gingersnaps
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
definitely
the
perfect
christmas
brew
i
had
a
cold
today
tasted
good
but
i
reserve
the
right
to
change
my
opinion
in
future
when
i
have
full
olfactory
and
taste
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
ginger
up
front
with
some
gently
roasted
malt
and
slight
caramel
quality
but
the
flavor
of
ginger
stays
steady
while
the
malt
seems
to
thin
or
dry
out
mid
palate
with
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
residual
and
mild
yeast
in
the
flavor
with
some
dry
spicy
flavor
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
with
medium
full
body
overall
this
is
pretty
solid
for
those
who
like
ginger
relatively
clean
but
somewhat
thin
in
the
realms
of
stouts
i
like
the
way
the
ginger
and
dark
malt
are
utilized
a
pretty
decent
base
stout
that
has
a
medium
sweet
quality
i
would
be
open
to
having
this
again
i
consider
this
a
good
winter
warmer
type
ale
mediumfull
body
maybe
a
bit
over
carbonated
great
taste
a
little
strong
on
the
alchol
in
my
opinion
but
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
love
anything
gingerbread
this
stout
is
nice
and
smooth
and
being
9
i
can
enjoy
it
slow
and
feel
good
this
holiday
this
to
me
is
a
great
take
on
a
seasonal
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
winter
long
this
would
be
a
perfect
desert
beer
after
a
meal
this
is
like
a
liquid
desert
i
highly
suggest
trying
this
i
know
i
will
be
stocking
up

overall
this
was
a
good
beer
that
is
worth

i
thought
this
had
a
great
nose
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
was
lacking
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
interesting

that
was

dont
understand
why
this
new

rating
system
will
not
save
wout
a
review
typical
malt
a
little
sweet
not
as
much
spices
as
i
would
have
liked
very
faint
hint
of
ginger
bubbly
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
gingerbread
flavor
is
kind
of
subltle
and
overall
the
flavors
arent
quite
as
bright
as
i
would
have
liked
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
holiday
beers
though
super
sweet
but
i
do
enjoy
this
as
a
desert
beer
beautiful
gingerbread
and
current
nose
thick
boozy
fruitcake
and
molasses
taste
throughout
sweetness
and
richness
may
be
a
bit
much
in
a
pint
might
be
better
sipping
in
small
glass
still
no
bad
really
thick
almost
syrupy
if
you
like
pepperidge
farms
ginger
man
cookies
this
is
right
up
your
alley
very
tasty
dessert
beer
overall
not
bad
for
a
winter
warmer
a
good
blend
of
spices
like
a
great
pumpkin
ale
a
good
stout
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
these
spicy
winter
beers
but
this
one
makes
for
a
good
sipper
the
mouth
is
thick
and
chewy
no
problem
there
well
sam
you
finally
put
out
a
decent
beer
i
heard
this
was
drinkable
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
stout
is
what
its
all
about
so
when
i
went
in
search
of
a
ba
pumking
i
saw
this
on
the
shelves
grabbed
one
and
had
it
for
thanksgiving
breakfast
not
bad
sam
not
bad
probably
the
best
yet
ive
had
from
you
not
to
bad
still
stouts
dont
seem
to
be
sams
strong
suit
not
worth
the
9
a
bottle
22oz
imo
i
enjoyed
harpoons
ufo
gingerland
a
few
times
on
my
last
visit
to
boston
and
i
was
hoping
that
the
boston
beer
company
could
pull
off
a
related
style
with
similar
affect
but
this
isnt
to
my
taste
nice
spiced
beer
from
sam
adams
you
cant
tell
it
is
9
pours
a
dark
black
color
in
a
pint
glass
no
lacing
and
very
little
head
that
fades
quick
spice
notes
come
out
up
front
and
a
little
alcohol
on
the
back
end
but
nothing
to
define
the
9
goes
good
in
a
cold
winter
day
pours
black
as
a
starless
night
world
class
head
lacing
and
retention
especially
for
a
9
abv
as
advertised
the
nose
is
full
of
ginger
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
roughly
that
order
of
composition
slightly
above
medium
in
body
the
texture
is
slick
with
hints
of
creaminess
above
average
carbonation
with
effervescence
throughout
the
outstanding
flavor
profile
is
intense
quite
complex
and
has
a
good
bit
of
balance
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
blended
spice
that
flows
into
a
mild
bitterness
the
bitterness
has
roast
and
hop
characteristics
as
the
bitterness
fades
the
spices
begin
to
separate
against
a
sweet
caramel
background
as
it
warms
the
caramel
gains
in
intensity
clove
and
nutmeg
dominate
the
end
but
a
light
dark
fruit
plumraisin
is
underneath
the
finish
is
quite
complex
as
it
fades
so
many
flavors
become
evident
the
9
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
the
only
traces
of
it
are
that
nice
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
if
you
want
to
taste
the
alcohol
you
have
to
sip
the
massive
head
the
only
fault
keeping
this
from
a
4
5
world
class
is
their
decision
to
classify
this
as
a
stout
there
just
isnt
enough
roast
character
had
they
called
it
a
porter
they
would
get
a
4
5
from
me
this
one
is
a
true
masterpiece
of
the
brewers
art
i
bought
the
1pint
6oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
i
let
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
trying
in
case
anyone
cares
always
on
the
lookout
for
the
most
recent
niche
style
brew
samuel
adams
rarely
gets
the
nod
not
to
discredit
any
of
their
many
enjoyable
brews
they
just
never
seem
to
be
quite
appealing
as
another
but
seein
lil
gingerbread
homie
with
his
broken
leg
had
me
sold
one
of
my
first
winter
warmers
of
this
season
and
it
poured
quite
thick
already
a
great
sign
especially
with
its
beautiful
2
inch
dark
tan
head
it
seemed
to
have
minimal
carbonation
but
its
hard
to
tell
due
to
the
opacity
of
the
brew
also
the
retention
of
the
head
and
the
lacing
were
both
above
average
immediately
on
the
nose
was
a
nice
heap
of
gingersnap
with
a
pleasant
cinnamon
spiciness
amongst
hints
of
cloves
and
wheat
as
it
first
graced
my
tongue
the
spice
was
the
most
prominent
feature
followed
by
a
hefty
gingerbread
flavor
the
stout
fullness
wasnt
as
pronounced
as
expected
with
the
finish
definitely
containing
some
roasty
malts
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
to
round
everything
out
the
mouthfeel
complimented
the
beer
nicely
as
the
gingerbread
wasnt
overpowered
by
any
other
aspect
and
the
carbonation
level
made
for
a
nice
enjoyable
drink
every
time
the
spices
reminded
me
of
many
marzenoktoberfest
style
beers
but
the
sweetness
balanced
out
this
nice
stout
i
found
this
beer
to
be
more
of
a
dessert
style
brew
which
was
surprising
for
a
stout
but
none
the
less
i
feel
like
this
would
be
a
great
way
to
end
a
holiday
evening
another
good
brew
cheers
pours
a
dark
rusty
brown
with
a
large
slowly
fading
creamy
brown
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
ginger
bread
and
sugar
cookie
molasses
nutmeg
taste
the
same
as
aroma
with
mild
toasted
malt
and
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
good
carbonation
mildly
creamy
finish
the
same
as
taste
with
a
full
flavored
and
mildly
burnt
toasted
bitterness
and
dry
ending
overall
would
probably
go
well
with
some
sugar
or
ginger
bread
cookies
a
nice
holiday
brew
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
some
sticky
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
like
gingerbread
cookies
which
i
would
eat
all
year
around
if
available
no
other
aroma
really
the
taste
is
a
less
bit
intense
than
the
aroma
with
some
roasted
hops
in
there
as
well
you
dont
taste
the
higher
alcohol
content
goes
down
easy
and
really
like
this
one
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
either
o
it
started
out
with
all
the
marks
of
a
really
fantastic
beer
until
i
tasted
it
i
just
doesnt
have
any
flavor
nothing
when
the
beer
first
hits
the
palate
nothing
midrange
nothing
on
the
back
nothing
in
the
aftertaste
just
an
extremely
light
roasted
flavor
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
it
would
work
well
as
an
aromatic
candle
for
christmas
but
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
quality
stout
and
doesnt
even
touch
the
flavor
of
a
cheap
store
bought
gingerbread
man
this
beer
leaves
me
kind
of
bummed
out
surprisingly
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
decent
smell
of
raisins
and
spices
no
gingerbread
heavy
beer
but
the
9
abv
is
very
noticeable
and
is
so
prevalent
that
it
is
hard
to
enjoy
cool
bottle
and
drinking
half
of
this
gave
a
nice
buzz
high
b
eric
overall
great
beer
with
a
great
spin
off
the
normal
i
really
apreciated
the
effort
the
the
boston
beer
company
takes
to
mix
up
the
holidays
with
an
outthere
beer
poured
into
a
reubens
brew
snifter
pours
pitch
black
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
finger
of
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
cap
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malt
slightly
toasty
and
gingerbread
as
advertised
flavor
is
sweet
dark
malt
hints
of
lactose
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
a
light
hop
finish
which
actually
gives
the
impression
of
the
spicier
types
of
gingerbread
with
bite
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
i
waited
to
drink
this
because
it
seemed
a
little
gimmicky
but
i
have
to
say
they
pulled
it
off
nice
sweet
malt
body
supports
the
gingerbread
spicing
which
is
well
done
the
alcohol
is
well
covered
much
better
than
i
expected
and
a
very
nice
winter
stout
id
buy
this
again
o
very
good
this
is
a
great
winter
seasonal
its
most
similar
to
another
of
my
favorites
st
arnolds
pumpkinator
overall
a
nice
beer
glad
to
try
it
i
may
have
served
it
a
little
too
warm
mouthfeel
a
slight
roughness
but
overall
satisfying
full
enough
to
satisfy
as
one
would
want
a
milk
stout
to
do
but
perhaps
a
bit
thinner
than
one
might
expect
cheers
o
you
have
to
like
sweet
beers
to
like
this
one
but
if
you
do
youll
love
it
it
took
me
some
searching
to
find
but
it
was
well
worth
the
time
and
effort
im
glad
its
a
yearly
release
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
from
the
tap
pours

with
a
nice

of

sme
cinnamon
tastes

gingerbread
chocolate
and
spices
beer
is
full
bodied
good
carbonation
nice
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
for
sipping
on
cold
evenings
overall
this
beer
is
decent
enough
but
it
could
be
a
lot
smoother
the
spicing
works
out
great
in
the
aroma
not
so
much
anywhere
else
dark
brown
pour
settled
into
a
near
black
liquid
into
the
glass
and
the
head
above
that
was
khaki
in
color
and
two
fingers
thick
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
malty
and
had
aromas
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
the
smell
wasnt
particularly
like
gingerbread
but
the
taste
was
a
little
closer
the
ginger
was
heavier
in
the
taste
and
the
malt
was
most
like
brown
sugar
there
were
also
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
taste
making
it
more
complex
than
the
cookies
the
wheat
in
the
malt
was
also
evident
in
the
bock
like
bready
flavor
the
label
mentions
cloves
but
those
were
not
easily
detectable
for
me
under
the
other
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
a
lot
thinner
than
most
stouts
and
the
finish
had
some
lingering
spice
this
beer
was
nice
winter
seasonal
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
goes
down
rather
quick
and
easy
leaving
a
little
residue
on
the
back
and
middle
of
the
tongue
carbonation
is
easy
going
o
while
merry
maker
scores
well
in
three
out
of
four
categories
it
lacks
in
the
most
important
departmentthe
flavor
this
brew
truly
lives
up
to
its
name
as
a
gingerbread
stout
and
even
though
i
have
nothing
against
gingerbread
men
theyre
my
favorite
holiday
treats
sam
adams
has
gone
slightly
overboard
in
the
sweetness
department
if
they
tone
down
the
sugariness
is
that
a
word
of
this
brew
i
can
see
it
being
one
of
my
seasonal
musthaves
until
then
however
one
bottle
of
merry
maker
has
been
more
than
enough
to
last
me
a
lifetime
merry
maker
pours
a
blackish
color
with
no
head
there
is
an
aroma
filled
with
gingerbread
and
cinnamon
the
taste
also
has
a
strong
gingerbread
flavor
with
cinnamon
and
frosting
notes
very
good
flavors
but
overall
its
a
bit
light
overall
its
a
very
tasty
beer
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
richer
in
taste
overall
if
only
the
flavors
lived
up
to
the
aromatics
but
this
beer
lacks
depth
and
body
surprising
for
a
9
percenter
this
looks
really
good
in
the
glass
but
for
me
the
spices
overpower
the
aleiness
imho
this
is
just
another
sweet
drink
covering
a
modest
amount
of
ethanol
overall
a
fantastic
smelling
and
tasting
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
really
hinder
those
two
characteristics
from
being
the
stars
they
would
otherwise
be
i
will
say
thisim
likely
to
seek
this
one
out
for
at
least
one
drink
each
season
especially
since
sam
adams
is
the
only
brewer
doing
a
gingerbread
stout
that
im
aware
of
this
is
an
interesting
seasonal
beer
by
the
boston
beer
company
i
would
buy
this
again
o
i
give
sam
adams
credit
on
this
one
many
of
their
newer
beers
they
sell
in
those
bombers
are
just
ok
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
at
a
reasonable
price
very
tasty
stout
thats
highly
drinkable
and
not
overly
filling
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
stout
fans

do
not

this
is
a

more
of
a

of

d
not
bad
but
for
a
78
bomber
i
expect
a
better
product
black
in
color
forms
a
moderate
sized
creamy
dark
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
unsurprisingly
gingerbread
moderate
sweetness
ginger
brown
bread
molasses
with
a
dark
caramel
maltiness
taste
is
similar
mildly
sweet
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
again
ginger
and
molasses
mild
breadiness
dark
malts
full
bodied
lower
carbonation
sort
of
reminiscent
of
gingerbread
but
not
quite
sweet
enough
ends
up
tasting
like
a
spiced
winter
beer
which
i
guess
it
is
notes
the
spices
are
powerful
the
sweetness
is
a
little
cloying
in
small
doses
this
is
fine
o
for
only
a
mere
few
bucks
this
was
a
really
nice
christmas
entry
i
like
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
bakery
spiciness
that
makes
up
the
character
of
the
taste
dark
sweet
malts
are
there
but
more
subtle
decent
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
pulls
up
from
behind
the
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
but
i
would
still
define
this
one
as
a
sipper
black
in
color
poured
with
a
huge
thick
dark
beige
foam
that
hung
around
for
a
while
foam
slowly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
thick
sheets
of
lacings
on
the
glass
undeniable
sweet
gingerbread
aroma
is
immediately
noticeable
along
with
cinnamon
clove
and
spice
sugar
and
spice
aromas
tend
to
overwhelm
the
roasted
malt
aromas
but
they
are
there
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thick
creamy
smooth
feel
and
light
subdued
carbonation
at
the
back
end
sweet
gingerbread
and
cinnamon
flavors
up
front
spicy
hop
flavors
through
the
middle
followed
by
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
to
the
end
finishes
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
followed
by
lingering
roasted
malt
aftertaste
you
pretty
much
get
what
the
label
says
youre
gonna
get
gingerbread
and
spice
certainly
not
your
everyday
go
to
stout
but
a
pleasant
holiday
brew
nonetheless
o
a
nice
winter
beer
stronger
that
i
was
expecting
share
with
friends
throw
in
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
or
cheddar
cheese
great
christmas
brew
im
not
a
ginger
in
my
beer
fan
but
the
malt
and
sweetness
counter
nicely
making
this
enjoyable
the
ginger
is
just
a
touch
overdone
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
an
oversized
1
pint
6
ounce
bottle
6

per
bottle
dark
stout
with
a
nice
half
inch
tan
head
smells
delicious
tastes
almost
as
good
9
abv
but
it
doesnt
taste
boozey
expensive
but
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
winter
beer
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
on
the
thin
for
a
stout
but
this
beer
still
has
great
flavor
profile
for
a
sam
adams
im
really
happy
with
this
its
easy
to
drink
has
a
wellhidden
alcohol
level
and
has
great
flavors
really
nothing
not
to
like
o
and
really
the
flavor
feels
watered
down
too
im
not
quite
sure
what
happened
here
the
nose
is
a
big
fat
cheap
gingerbread
cookie
there
is
really
nothing
big
fat
or
decadent
in
the
taste
or
feel
id
almost
welcome
a
more
cloying
version
that
was
so
sweet
it
was
hard
to
finish
it
would
be
more
true
to
the
promise
as
is
this
beer
is
not
really
offensive
but
it
is
somewhat
disappointing
this
beer
was
treat
and
i
really
liked
it
had
all
the
dark
and
big
roast
of
any
well
made
stout
plus
the
pleasant
cookie
spices
the
malt
was
stalwart
and
unflinching
the
earth
was
subtle
it
leaves
dry
and
with
a
slight
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
to
contrast
the
sweet
and
silken
molasses
o
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
the
pumpkincinnamonmildly
sweet
vein
pretty
good
stuff
the
festive
spices
so
commonly
associated
with
gingerbread
and
pumpkin
pie
are
this
ones
main
attraction
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
for
sure
overall
overall
i
enjoyed
the
marry
maker
from
the
appearance
to
the
taste
the
after
taste
to
me
is
very
important
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
beer
gives
off
a
nice
after
taste
taste
like
gingerbread
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
strong
kick
slightly
filling
not
the
best
representation
of
style
but
the
flavor
makes
sense
for
a
christmas
beer
o
merry
maker
is
a
solid
spiced
milk
stout
that
is
appropriate
for
the
season
its
a
bit
boozy
and
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
heavy
stout
but
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
spices
and
smellslooks
great
an
enjoyable
beer
that
you
should
check
out
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
with
spice
over
all
i
guess
this
beer
is
like
waking
up
and
getting
coal
for
christmas
you
go
down
stairs
all
excited
expecting
greatness
and
are
left
with
a
dark
piece
of
disappointment
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
buy
beer
to
drink
it
not
smell
it
o
a
decent
stout
on
its
own
accord
but
not
impressive
as
a
christmas
beer
certainly
not
reminiscent
of
gingerbread
thats
not
to
say
it
wasnt
good
just
that
it
fell
short
of
my
expectations
especially
after
the
rather
enjoyable
fat
jack
pumpkin
ale
they
turned
out
a
few
months
ago
the
single
worst
beer
that
i
have
had
this
year
two
sips
then
down
the
drain
the
bottle
went
horrible
metallic
taste
with
absolutely
no
nutmeg
ginger
etc
i
like
hardywood
an
decided
to
try
this
as
an
easy
to
obtain
alternative
bad
move
do
not
waste
your
time
with
this
slop
pours
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
decent
retention
and
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
ginger
spice
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
full
bodied
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
just
an
explosion
of
spices
with
hints
of
chocolate
very
smooth
yet
there
is
quite
a
nice
burn
excellent
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
just
had
a
rival
gingerbread
ale
from
blue
moon
and
this
one
killed
it
nice
aroma
with
cinnamon
ginger
and
cloves
up
front
and
center
mouthfeel
is
terrific
and
goes
down
with
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
at
the
end
very
drinkable
beer
wanted
another
after
i
finished
highly
recommend
what
a
disappointment
it
has
no
distinct
flavor
of
anything
it
tastes
like
a
watery
mix
of
spice
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
robust
ginger
stout
i
cant
even
get
a
hint
of
ginger
anywhere
in
this
beer
pass
on
this
one
it
is
the
total
personification
of
liquid
gingerbread
that
wins
the
all
5s
for
this
brew
was
hoping
for
more
ahh
very
very
nice
o
overall
a
great
seasonal
spin
on
a
sweet
stout
i
am
a
fan
and
will
be
buying
more
throughout
the
season
especially
with
friends
over
o
the
sweetness
and
spices
in
the
nose
are
overpowering
but
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
the
gingerbread
flavor
is
striking
but
at
the
same
time
merry
mischief
manages
to
fit
the
bill
for
a
stout
different
but
delicious
pours
a
deep
chocolate
brown
with
deep
walnut
brown
showing
thru
when
held
to
the
lighta
nice
looking
creamy
near
mocha
colored
head
atop
alot
of
roast
in
the
nose
along
with
spicy
ginger
and
sweet
alcohol
lingering
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
bit
of
char
at
the
onsetthe
spiced
notes
come
in
the
back
end
with
gingerand
clove
standing
out
mainlyalot
of
roast
and
dry
earthiness
to
this
milk
stout
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
as
well
the
sweetness
derived
from
itnot
overly
spiced
but
not
a
bad
beer
should
go
well
with
most
holiday
deserts
especially
gingerbread
o
another
beer
where
the
palate
cant
quite
match
the
nose
overall
though
it
turned
out
alright
still
not
one
id
seek
out
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
for
me
it
was
spicy
and
sweet
overpowering
on
both
but
again
would
of
went
well
with
fooddesert
alcohol
was
there
but
the
sweetness
masked
it
a
bit
i
am
definitely
gonna
pick
up
another
bottle
and
sit
on
it
for
a
while
although
i
would
recommend
drinking
it
with
friends
and
food
drinkability
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
9abv
i
wished
the
sweet
gingerbread
was
slightly
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
good
nonetheless
a
nice
suprise
glad
to
have
found
this
one
o
overall
this
is
a
spicy
holiday
chocolate
dessert
style
beer
the
ginger
comes
on
strong
at
times
though
is
managebale
perhaps
in
servings
smaller
then
original

the
malting
was
nice

this

great
balance
of
dark

flavors
with
good

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
really
enjoyed
this
one
atmosphere
is
really
good
dark
hue
giant
head
and
fair
enough
lacing
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
fall
spices
with
some
nice
lightly
roasted
coffee
flavor
is
a
bitter
roasted
malty
combination
with
a
consideration
of
spice
but
ultimately
nothing
really
there
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
i
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
it
has
a
black
color
body
with
a
2
tan
head
which
hung
around
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
very
spicy
of
ginger
nutmeg
and
some
cinnamon
the
taste
has
a
very
strong
ginger
flavor
that
follow
with
the
nutmeg
and
clove
then
the
roasted
malt
come
in
behind
it
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
kinda
thick
but
not
too
thick
it
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
a
after
taste
but
not
too
much
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
i
couldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
them
at
a
time
but
once
in
a
while
is
good
certainly
not
subtle
on
the
spicing
here
the
ginger
was
perhaps
too
dominant
im
reminded
more
of
an
assertive
pumpkin
ale
than
a
sweeter
gingerbread
holiday
flavor
that
said
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
stout
aftertaste
cleaned
up
nicely
and
the
body
was
smooth
d
this
was
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
it
had
tons
of
ginger
scent
and
taste
but
was
still
balanced
by
other
elements
it
had
a
big
body
and
a
fairly
smooth
finish
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
really
sure
how
it
would
age
but
i
like
it
now
recommended
to
at
least
try
o
the
only
beer
ive
had
better
than
this
is
pumpkinator
and
theyre
both
so
similar
i
can
honestly
say
that
desert
imperial
stout
is
a
fantastic
idea
so
come
on
with
it
folks
gimme
some
apple
pie
stout
so
ill
never
waste
money
on
desert
again
not
a
bad
experience
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
the
one
bottle
unless
you
love
ginger
then
you
wont
really
like
this
beer
as
with
all
stouts
as
it
warmed
up
more
flavor
came
out
unfortunately
the
flavor
was
ginger
which
is
great
with
sushi
but
not
in
this
beer
this
was
very
disappointing
for
me
as
i
had
very
high
expectations
tough
to
finish
this
bomber
alone
so
sadly
some
was
poured
down
the
drain
o
this
would
be
fine
if
split
3
or
4
ways
an
entire
bottle
is
too
much
ginger
for
one
human
i
have
liked
most
of
these
sam
specials
this
one
may
be
my
favorite
its
black
with
a
head
the
color
of
ginger
bread
cookies
the
smell
is
full
of
spices
and
brown
sugar
smells
like
ginger
bread
cookies
the
taste
is
bitter
followed
by
sweet
spices
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
christmas
bottle
was
5
50
for
a
pint
at
9abv
its
a
steal
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
gets
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
but
for
me
it
never
really
seems
to
come
together
maybe
it
would
improve
with
a
bit
more
aging
o
overall
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
it
is
just
a
little
too
light
in
the
mouthfeel
to
be
as
enjoyable
as
i
hoped
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
very
pleasant
and
remind
me
of
gingerbread
this
poured
out
as
a
dark
black
color
kinda
thick
looking
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
was
minimal
and
very
little
lacing
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
loaded
with
spice
not
much
of
anything
else
really
showing
through
here
the
taste
of
is
also
spicy
with
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
in
there
while
finishing
dry
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
not
overly
smooth
like
i
think
it
should
be
there
is
a
decent
thickness
to
the
beer
though
overall
its
a
decent
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
its
an
interesting
idea
and
it
smelled
good
but
it
came
up
a
little
short
in
the
gingerbread
beer
concept
o
this
is
a
decent
stout
the
spices
that
are
listed
on
the
bottle
are
certainly
apparent
and
are
actually
a
little
overpowering
with
all
the
spices
many
classic
stout
features
are
masked
or
lost
nevertheless
it
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
that
is
wellsuited
for
the
holidays
pours

an
interesting
stout
overall
one
of
the
better
sa
small
batch
series
in
terms
of
being
what
it
aimed
to
be
this
is
a
good
conversation
piece
and
has
some
extremely
complex
elements
to
it
im
not
sure
the
recipe
is
perfect
yet
and
im
convinced
they
wont
improve
or
alter
it
for
the
future
but
the
focus
on
spice
is
a
bit
too
narrow
in
my
opinion
i
have
to
say
i
had
my
doubts
at
first
but
samuel
adams
has
really
pulled
off
a
good
one
this
beer
is
so
gingerbread
like
it
is
scary
like
someone
put
a
pulverized
gingerbread
man
into
a
stout
i
really
wish
i
wouldve
tried
this
earlier
so
i
could
have
picked
up
another
bottle
to
age
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
there
is
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
to
a
thin
cap
which
persists
for
the
duration
the
aroma
is
strong
of
gingerbread
cookie
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
gingerbread
spices
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
brew
had
a
spicy
mouthfeel
with
a
faint
pleasant
burning
sensation
on
the
lips
and
a
lively
presence
on
the
palate
delicious
i
hope
that
sa
will
make
this
more
widely
available
in
the
future
id
gladly
pick
up
a
6er
of
this
if
it
was
available
if
you
dont
care
for
the
taste
of
gingerbread
you
probably
wont
like
this
beer
though
overall
wellintegrated
alcohol
and
the
spice
character
was
pleasant
without
being
overthetop
i
thought
it
was
better
than
i
had
expected
o
this
beer
has
an
interesting
taste
and
does
resemble
gingerbread
but
overall
i
thought
it
would
be
much
better
if
it
had
a
fuller
mouthfeel
to
support
its
strength
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
opretty
solid
beer
definitely
strong
gingerbread
presence
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
but
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
body
and
creaminess
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
almost
black
with
a
creamy
brown
head
aromas
of
figs
and
a
hint
of
ginger
taste
begins
with
some
light
chocolate
followed
by
some
plums
then
some
dark
bread
then
some
herbal
and
nutty
flavors
the
finish
has
a
big
ginger
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
light
but
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
though
it
is
somewhat
surprising
that
it
is
not
richer
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
added
milk
sugar
pours
a
light
tan
fourfinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
jet
black
color
no
highlights
good
carbonation
and

bodied

and

nose
flavor
is
almost
like
gingerbread

7
25
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
not
a
bad
beer
from
sam
adams
opaque
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
spicy
aroma
its
not
a
full
blown
gingerbread
cookie
but
i
got
cinnamon
ginger
primarily
you
know
christmasy
winter
warmery
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
dark
malts
cocoa
powder
a
touch
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
kind
of
reminded
me
more
of
a
heavier
winter
warmer
or
a
spiced
strong
ale
than
a
stout
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
brown
head
there
is
a
semimalty
and
spice
aroma
the
taste
is
decently
bold
with
mostly
malts
and
spices
its
fairly
decent
for
a
stout
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
different
taste
for
something
that
was
suppose
to
have
gingerbread
spices
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
slight
cocoa
and
a
variety
of
spices
like
cinnamon
and
clove
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
mild
spices
and
a
salty
soy
sauce
flavor
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
sounds
good
on
paper
but
isnt
done
all
that
well
in
my
opinion
so
i
really
am
not
a
fan
of
samuel
adams
but
when
i
saw
that
this
was
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
i
picked
it
up
it
pours
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
with
nice
retention
the
lacing
is
magnificent
it
clings
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
and
then
performs
a
slow
elegant
dance
as
it
retreats
back
into
the
black
depths
from
which
it
came
aesthetically
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
the
aroma
carries
strong
aromas
of
alcohol
along
with
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
hint
of
clove
is
also
present
the
taste
carries
hints
of
dark
toasted
malt
and
classic
holiday
spices
the
cloves
and
nutmeg
really
shine
through
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
laced
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
the
previously
mentiontioned
holiday
spice
the
mouthfeel
thick
with
low
carbonation
man
this
beer
is
a
home
run
every
holiday
beer
should
be
this
good
this
one
pours
like
motor
oil
with
a
jet
black
body
topped
by
a
two
finger
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
gingerbread
caramel
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
very
seasonally
appropriate
flavor
is
well
done
and
i
was
shocked
it
wasnt
too
sweet
with
breads
cinnoman
vanilla
mild
roasted
malt
gingerbread
full
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
i
was
actually
really
surprised
by
this
one
its
flavorful
but
not
overdone
an
excellent
seasonal
fascinating
beer
this
unlike
any
ive
ever
tried
and
id
gladly
have
it
again
the
recently
opened
nevins
brew
house
had
the
merry
mischief
on
tap
and
it
was
goood
the
beer
was
poured
into
an
8oz
sniffer
it
was
black
opaque
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
did
not
lace
the
smell
was
bolstered
by
black
licorice
sp
the
taste
had
hints
of
anis
but
i
tasted
more
chocolate
and
ginger
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
full
in
body
with
subtle
cabonation
overall
this
was
a
great
seasonal
stout
and
i
would
have
this
over
and
over
o
decent
enough
but
the
flavours
did
not
produce
a
gingerbread
like
profile
as
expected
o
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
dominating
spice
drowns
out
the
chocolate
character
i
had
a
second
pint
to
make
sure
i
loved
it
as
much
as
i
thought
i
did
on
the
first
yes
i
do
now
i
need
to
go
round
up
any
bottles
i
can
still
find
out
there
hope
its
close
to
being
as
good
from
the
bottle
overall
a
nice
tasting
and
interesting
version
of
a
sweet
stout
it
could
of
used
a
little
more
roast
to
balance
the
spices
but
what
is
there
is
pretty
good
anyways
an
oily
midnight
black
body
with
a
foamy
mocha
cap
the
head
falls
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
some
mild
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
abrasive
at
first
molasses
is
prominent
with
ginger
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
tow
a
touch
of
roast
hangs
in
the
background
on
the
palate
syrupy
molasses
coats
the
tongue
with
spices
quickly
overwhelming
the
palate
nutmeg
and
ginger
stand
out
most
with
some
cinnamon
in
the
background
some
very
mild
roast
comes
through
as
this
warms
overly
sweet
cloyingly
so
with
the
molasses
just
pummeling
the
taste
buds
everything
is
secondary
a
touch
of
english
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
syrupy
body
with
some
robust
flavors
but
this
was
offputting
for
me
i
couldnt
handle
the
whole
bottle
myself
the
gingerbread
flavors
are
all
there
heavy
on
the
molasses
though
so
it
definitely
hits
the
style
points
but
this
didnt
quite
jive
with
my
palate
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
light
tan
head
above
average
retention
abundant
splotchy
lacing
alot
of
spice
on
the
nose
ginger
being
most
prominent
followed
by
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
hints
of
clove
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
added
chocolate
but
the
spicing
is
far
too
strong
and
completely
dominates
as
the
base
beer
is
difficult
to
discern
moderate
to
low
carbonation
smooth
with
a
hint
of
velvet
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
promise
however
the
amount
of
spices
used
is
excessive
with
some
changes
in
the
recipe
this
beer
could
become
an
excellent
holiday
treat
overall
a
rather
tasty
stout
with
a
nice
sweet
and
spiced
flavor
while
rather
heavy
in
the
gingerbread
cookie
spices
up
front
they
dwindle
down
as
the
taste
advanced
never
really
getting
the
chance
to
overpower
the
brew
and
producing
overall
a
rather
nice
and
flavorful
stout
o
i
enjoyed
this
take
on
a
sweet
stout
though
it
wasnt
as
balanced
as
i
wouldve
liked
with
a
bigger
appearance
from
the
roasted
malts
this
could
have
been
much
better
as
is
it
is
a
flawed
but
unique
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
that
ill
try
again
on
occasion
overall
a
very
good
beer
im
glad
i
sought
it
out
a
strong
wintertime
beer
not
a
beer
id
have
on
a
regular
basis
but
an
enjoyable
annual
christmas
cookie
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
have
been
underwhelmed
its
just
another
stout
with
spice
and
poorlyhidden
alcohol
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
alright
and
i
thought
it
was
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
style
the
spices
really
showed
up
in
this
beer
and
that
made
it
a
little
unbalanced
it
needs
more
stout
flavors
and
aromas
to
bring
some
balance
to
this
beer
and
make
it
more
stout
like
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
but
i
think
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
after
that
the
sweetness
and
spices
might
become
too
much
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
9
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
good
and
it
had
some
gingerbread
like
qualitys
to
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
unbalanced
it
was
if
this
beer
had
more
balance
it
would
be
pretty
damn
good
i
would
buy
a
bottle
of
this
if
its
released
next
year
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
going
back
to
get
another
bottle
for
this
season
the
price
was
good
and
i
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
all
in
all
this
was
another
solid
beer
from
samuel
adams
it
wasnt
as
great
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
just
wish
it
had
more
stout
aspects
to
it
good
job
guys
this
is
a
nice
christmas
time
beer
beer
is
gingery
but
not
overwhelmingly
spicy
it
is
fine
but
thin
very
thin
dry
finish
too
dry
mild
aftertaste
of
cloves
and
ginger
mild
nutmeg
it
was
fine
but
as
stated
previously
this
could
have
been
better
o
this
is
a
good
brew
for
the
season
i
did
however
find
myself
wishing
some
of
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
bold
and
pronounced
for
9abv
it
is
very
drinkable
and
pairs
well
with
all
of
the
various
chocolate
desserts
that
come
with
christmas
time
overall
sam
adams
beers
arent
always
up
my
alley
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
great
beer
for
the
holidays
d
the
spices
are
prominent
and
they
initially
promise
to
work
well
with
the
dark
bready
malt
but
in
the
end
it
is
just
too
much
the
sweetness
is
excessive
and
this
makes
the
spice
character
feel
cloying
as
well
it
needs
some
sharpness
to
counteract
the
cloying
flabby
malt
and
spice
character
overall
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
bad
flavored
coffee
drink
than
a
stout
with
too
much
spice
too
much
sweetness
and
nothing
to
balance
o
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
i
thought
it
was
a
bust
at
first
with
the
strong
spics
up
front
as
this
beer
opens
up
the
richness
of
the
stout
becomes
more
prominent
it
is
a
very
well
made
stout
and
the
spices
give
it
a
holiday
spin
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
gingerbread
and
stouts
if
you
do
not
like
spices
then
stay
away
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
beige
head
good
retention
on
a
black
body
oily
and
soapy
lacing
tiny
bubbles
aroma
includes
nutmeg
slight
coffee
some
faint
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
nice
roasted
quality
with
a
moderate
sweetness
some
vanilla
and
nutmeg
really
nice
flavor
thick
mouthfeel
very
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
no
alcohol
taste
high
abv
and
delicious
is
a
very
dangerous
combination
overall
its
a
pretty
rich
complex
dessert
beer
the
9
abv
is
almost
undetectable
good
interesting
beer
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
25oz
snifter
is
black
like
molasses
with
a
frothy
tan
head
great
retention
excellent
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aromas
are
spicy
like
gingerbread
clove
ginger
cinnamon
nutmeg
as
they
reveal
on
the
label
not
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
tastes
are
clove
ginger
cinnamon
nutmeg
roasted
barley
cream
molasses
cookie
dough
seems
to
be
there
too
alcohol
is
well
concealed
especially
for
9
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
medium
body
overall
good
for
what
it
is
it
actually
tastes
like
gingerbread
nice
work
over
all
a
fantastic
beer
well
suited
for
the
holidays
looks
like
motor
oil
pouring
into
a
glass
absolutely
pitch
black
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
tan
head
smells
very
nice
cloves
ginger
and
a
touch
of
citrus
strike
the
nose
very
clean
aroma
very
smooth
taste
clove
and
cinnamon
followed
by
a
touch
of
sweetness
with
a
spiced
aftertaste
alcohol
taste
is
well
hidden
though
i
feel
a
warming
effect
after
the
third
sip
so
this
is
definately
strong
just
a
touch
heavy
on
the
clove
i
think
and
could
benefit
from
just
a
little
more
sweetness
cinnamon
and
old
leather
on
the
most
pleasently
creamy
body
and
relatively
smooth
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
upfront
followed
by
holiday
spices
faintly
reminiscent
of
a
ginger
bread
cookie
but
not
as
much
as
you
expect
slightly
burnt
tasting
at
times
simple
but
has
flavors
that
go
together
a
nice
sweet
stout
that
doesnt
push
limits
or
offend
alcohol
is
undetectable
which
is
nice
made
for
people
who
drink
only
sam
adams
but
wont
venture
any
further
into
the
craft
world
overall
not
the
most
complex
of
the
sam
adams
special
releases
but
a
quality
beer
if
you
like
ginger
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
once
a
winter
but
craving
it
more
than
that
83
b
the
beer
pours
proper
stouty
black
with
a
nice
big
tan
head
on
it
the
bubbles
are
tight
and
creamy
but
the
body
is
pitch
black
and
opaque
but
looked
relatively
clear
as
it
went
into
the
glass
the
lacing
on
my
glass
is
really
quite
droopy
and
thin
leaving
little
dots
across
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
spicy
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
and
a
touch
of
ginger
which
really
isnt
surprising
seeing
as
how
those
are
the
spices
that
were
used
in
the
beer
the
cinnamon
is
the
strongest
in
smell
as
far
as
the
spices
go
but
below
the
spices
sits
a
strong
helping
of
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
black
coffee
which
is
really
quite
inviting
hot
alcohol
is
also
present
and
accentuated
with
the
spices
though
that
isnt
really
a
bad
thing
the
slurry
of
all
of
these
smells
helps
to
suggest
slight
dark
fruit
notes
in
the
beer
as
well
the
beer
tastes
terrifically
bizarre
and
spicy
the
beer
begins
with
roast
mingling
with
dark
raisin
notes
these
flavors
continue
especially
the
roast
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
opens
into
ginger
bread
hints
that
quickly
build
and
climax
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
before
petering
out
into
a
stale
cinnamon
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
of
watered
down
spices
and
comes
far
too
quickly
making
me
wish
the
gingerbread
flavors
would
stay
for
awhile
on
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
body
is
medium
with
hints
of
being
both
lighter
and
thicker
and
after
the
beer
passes
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
with
pooling
spittle
just
barely
ebbing
over
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
great
holiday
beer
with
a
nice
gimmicky
flavor
i
do
wish
the
gingerbread
flavor
would
stick
around
longer
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
brew
in
a
balanced
way
a
solid
holiday
brew
from
sam
adams
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
taste
or
a
christmas
tasting
a
very
nice
winter
sipper
alcohol
wellintegrated
it
has
nice
stout
features
recommended
overall
a
decent
holiday
beer
although
for
something
advertised
as
a
gingerbread
stout
i
was
looking
for
more
gingerbread
flavor
the
malt
seems
to
cover
up
the
spices
a
little
bit
comparable
to
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
o
its
not
necessarily
bad
persay
just
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
overall
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
thrown
into
the
holiday
mix
pack
just
wouldnt
buy
a
bomber
again
though
flavor
is
very
heavily
spiced
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
almost
like
pumpkin
pie
spicing
roasted
malts
a
mild
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
caramel
and
a
hint
of
lactose
round
out
the
flavor
its
wellcarbonated
the
body
mediumlight
but
lacking
some
of
that
smooth
and
fullbodied
creaminess
that
i
look
for
in
a
milk
stout
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
thick
dark
brown
coloring
that
borders
on
black
with
an
opaque
character
that
is
devoid
of
highlighting
colors
a
small
low
profile
head
of
dark
tan
rests
on
top
but
quickly
settles
into
a
sparse
filmy
coating
as
the
beer
sits
for
a
bit
good
looking
beer
aromas
of
sweet
gingerbread
roasted
and
baked
dough
a
spice
profile
rich
in
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
banana
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
booze
as
well
smells
like
a
rich
warming
brew
flavors
are
round
and
robust
in
mouth
and
gingerbread
is
in
the
forefront
nutmeg
and
ginger
quickly
coat
the
taste
buds
with
an
underlying
boozey
backbone
that
flows
over
and
then
whisks
the
palate
clean
molasses
sweet
in
the
background
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
as
well
but
both
are
subtle
and
supporting
the
beer
is
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
but
the
flavor
profile
packs
a
wallop
on
your
sense
of
taste
a
very
fulfilling
and
grandoise
brew
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
compared
to
what
has
been
experienced
thus
far
with
a
touch
of
ginger
buttery
bread
and
a
hint
of
sugary
sweet
all
blending
together
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
and
the
higher
abv
helps
to
once
again
clean
everything
up
very
strong
stout
both
in
flavor
and
substance
very
tasty
and
a
great
wintertime
imbibe
good
beer
o
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
and
my
girlfriend
hated
it
too
much
pine
and
sprucechristmas
tree
in
the
nose
for
me
and
it
lingered
in
the
taste
as
well
seems
like
people
like
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
look
to
have
it
again
o
better
than
expected
blend
of
milksweet
stout
and
spiced
holiday
brew
recommended
o
with
a
nicely
blended
not
overthetop
mélange
of
spices
and
full
base
of
roasted
malt
samuel
adams
merry
mischief
puts
a
welcome
spin
on
an
imperial
stout
thats
not
so
imperial
feeling
if
you
find
yourself
spending
extended
time
in
the
cold
this
winter
season
trade
in
your
mug
of
hot
cocoa
for
a
delectable
merry
mischief
when
you
get
back
inside
this
was
an
ok
stout
there
was
some
good
initial
flavor
but
the
syrupy
texture
was
too
much
to
make
it
enjoyable
overall
very
pleasant
surprise
didnt
exactly
knock
my
socks
off
only
because
i
dont
really
think
a
gingerbread
stout
no
matter
how
well
done
would
manage
that
that
said
i
cant
imagine
a
better
gingerbread
stout
overall
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
pretty
accurate
representation
of
the
style
and
definitely
a
gingerbread
stout
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
it
got
sickening
near
the
end
of
the
bomber
but
i
difinitely
got
what
i
paid
for
d
excellent
appearance
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
let
down
the
net
result
is
a
very
nice
and
slightly
unique
holiday
offering
from
the
fine
folks
at
boston
beer
surprisingly
quaffable
and
hides
its
9
abv
rather
well
ill
gladly
indulge
this
one
each
holiday
season
but
may
drink
more
if
it
came
in
12
oz
bottles
merry
mischief
pours
out
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
sizable
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
its
really
got
a
nice
gingerbread
spice
thing
going
on
here
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
the
taste
is
really
gingerbread
all
the
way
through
beneath
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
cloves
from
the
nose
theres
a
bit
of
a
brown
sugar
flavor
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
thin
to
me
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
chewiness
on
this
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
delivers
on
the
first
part
of
the
label
theres
plenty
of
gingerbread
here
and
less
traditional
stout
flavors
tasty
meh
after
a
few
sips
i
cant
stand
the
mouthfeel
im
going
to
go
with
a
drain
pour
even
if
the
abv
should
allow
some
aging
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
brown
foam
sits
a
top
some
lacing
smells
like
a
gingerbread
man
shocker
cinamon
nutmeg
ginger
taste
is
lightly
sweet
cookieish
with
a
light
hop
finish
roasted
at
the
end
too
nice
blend
good
seasonal
really
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
the
smell
was
the
best
part
and
then
it
just
took
a
drastic
turn
tastes
like
a
bitter
gingerbread
cookie
not
because
its
burnt
but
as
if
it
has
no
sugar
this
misses
the
mark
on
the
stout
side
its
full
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
level
the
aftertaste
is
chocolatey
with
plenty
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
i
really
liked
the
aroma
and
thought
they
nailed
the
gingerbread
flavor
the
taste
though
seemed
to
get
overshadowed
by
the
spices
a
little
less
spice
and
more
of
the
stout
flavors
would
have
gone
a
long
way
in
the
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
though
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
medium
brown
head
head
had
a
bit
of
side
cling
and
left
a
tad
of
lacing
predominant
aroma
was
definitely
reminiscent
of
gingerbread
mostly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
bit
of
the
sweet
lactose
aroma
came
out
as
time
went
on
taste
was
very
slightly
sweet
up
front
before
ending
with
a
peppery
bitter
note
coated
the
mouth
as
it
should
but
needed
a
tad
more
carbonation
in
the
mouth
unfortunately
didnt
really
work
as
a
milk
stout
nor
did
it
live
up
to
the
gingerbread
title
o
overall
a
very
well
done
gingerbread
stout
i
had
gbs
from
hardywood
brewing
earlier
this
week
and
this
is
nearly
as
good
easier
to
find
and
cheaper
hard
to
compare
of
course
but
the
one
thing
that
i
do
not
pick
up
in
here
are
the
frosting
like
flavors
there
are
however
more
roasted
caramelized
sugars
and
toffee
flavors
present
which
seem
to
be
more
well
done
than
the
hardywood
gbs
overall
this
is
a
good
offering
i
dont
understand
why
there
is
not
more
spice
in
the
taste
when
the
spices
are
present
in
the
smell
it
is
sweet
like
a
milk
stout
should
be
but
a
few
more
hops
would
be
nice
to
balance
the
sweetness
im
honestly
quite
impressed
by
this
one
im
really
not
a
hater
but
samuel
adams
normally
fall
a
bit
flat
for
me
this
is
sweet
flavorful
and
it
delivers
on
the
gingerbread
spices
it
may
not
be
earth
shattering
or
ground
breaking
but
this
is
a
very
good
holiday
seasonal
stout
that
i
plan
on
enjoying
several
more
times
in
the
future
the
bottle
art
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
oits
a
holiday
stout
from
sam
adams
dont
expect
an
epic
concoction
of
flavors
to
be
satisfied
just
expect
an
average
christmas
flavored
ale
its
a
bit
too
artificial
tasting
to
be
a
great
imperial
stout
minus
the
gingerbread
and
autumn
spices
its
still
just
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
definitely
drinks
like
a
9
beer
with
its
thickness
i
suggest
to
drink
this
with
a
friend
few
people
here
will
want
the
whole
bottle
of
this
only
get
this
if
youre
very
curious
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
there
was
an
interesting
smoke
to
the
malts
with
relatively
genuine
gingerbread
spice
and
breadiness
what
was
really
surprising
actually
was
the
licorice
bite
through
the
taste
this
helped
to
cut
the
cloying
white
and
cooked
brown
sugar
sweetness
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
drinkability
was
a
bit
hindered
by
this
sweetness
making
the
drinker
ease
up
and
slow
down
for
the
last
half
this
is
more
of
a
dessert
beverage
and
would
be
best
suited
to
split
with
someone
after
a
meal
or
with
a
nice
fudge
brownie
o
a
different
approach
from
the
usual
christmas
time
stout
i
liked
it
but
it
was
from
a
tap
had
to
let
it
sit
for
10
mins
well
worth
the
wait
though
personally
prefering
a
heartier
roast
beer
for
such
assertive
spice
addition
i
think
that
this
fine
ale
suffers
from
being
a
little
too
dry
and
roasty
which
exposes
a
slight
ashy
and
burr
textures
that
could
have
been
rounded
out
by
a
little
extra
sweetness
from
barley
malt
or
from
more
confident
milk
sugar
taste
for
a
christmas
offering
its
pretty
decent
the
ginger
might
be
a
little
much
for
my
taste
though
o
a
pretty
impressive
showing
from
sa
christmas
in
a
bottle
kind
of
a
gimmick
as
its
hard
to
find
any
other
flavors
beneath
the
spices
but
its
done
so
well
that
i
enjoyed
it
despite
its
flaw
probably
a
repeat
buy
for
me
next
winter
o
the
smell
has
a
nice
gingerbread
note
without
showing
the
base
beer
enough
the
flavor
allows
the
base
beer
to
come
through
more
appropriately
but
has
a
ginger
flavor
that
overwhelms
with
some
tweaks
this
good
be
good
as
is
its
mediocre
o
3
75
not
bad
but
underwhelming
and
doesnt
quite
come
together
seemingly
trapped
between
cohesive
styles
theres
also
a
hole
in
its
middle
where
the
flavor
goes
diffuse
and
vague
3
5
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
rich
bold
and
sweet
the
ginger
bread
comes
in
sort
of
tart
which
makes
it
easier
to
drink
plus
the
sweetness
balances
with
the
spices
really
nicely
if
it
tasted
just
a
bit
more
like
the
graham
cracker
crust
itd
be
perfect
but
its
still
an
amazing
beer
the
ginger
shines
and
i
really
like
ginger
so
i
really
like
this
beer
especially
mixing
in
with
the
amazing
sweet
malts
they
chose
for
this
a
cool
winter
brew
but
this
was
a
let
down
to
me
in
a
few
ways
the
pour
is
sensational
really
dark
and
thick
with
a
delicate
but
excitable
dark
brown
head
the
nose
is
more
spice
than
gingerbread
i
think
lots
of
nutmeg
and
clove
a
touch
of
ginger
and
dark
roasty
coffee
smelling
malts
the
taste
is
also
more
spiced
than
necessary
lots
and
lots
of
nutmeg
it
doesnt
taste
like
gingerbread
to
me
but
it
tastes
good
nonetheless
lots
of
burnt
malt
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
and
a
velvety
smooth
texture
that
really
makes
this
beer
as
a
holiday
stout
or
something
id
like
it
better
but
i
was
hoping
for
fresh
baked
gingerbread
and
the
malt
profile
and
the
spice
blend
fail
to
deliver
that
a
good
beer
overall
though
with
an
abv
that
is
just
right
this
time
of
year
worth
the
price
per
bomber
but
dont
come
into
this
expecting
gingerbread
overall
not
really
worth
a
repeat
offering
but
i
felt
for
7
dollars
for
16oz
of
this
was
worth
it
one
of
the
better
beers
i
had
from
samuel
adams
ginger
bomb
and
some
other
stuff
on
the
side
pairs
well
with
ginger
snap
o
this
is
a
suprisingly
wonderful
beer
this
weird
bottle
series
from
sa
is
a
little
hit
or
miss
but
this
is
a
hit
for
sure
this
baby
is
worth
checking
out
i
dunno
why
but
sa
does
christmas
beers
right
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
well
done
i
shared
the
bomber
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
a
perfect
brew
to
enjoy
around
the
holidays
i
hope
it
makes
a
return
next
year
black
as
coal
with
a
sudsy
brown
head
strong
aroma
of
gingerbread
accompanied
by
spice
and
florals
the
gingerbread
flavor
is
spot
on
and
has
a
creamy
aftertaste
not
unlike
icing
the
high
abv
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
effect
the
flavor
this
is
a
really
wunique
wellbalanced
christmas
brew
this
beer
after
a
while
it
develops
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
whether
its
due
to
warming
or
my
palate
being
exhausted
by
all
the
spice
i
dont
know
but
i
think
this
one
would
be
better
shared
among
a
few
friends
rjt
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
black
with
a
little
more
than
a
fingerlength
tan
head
the
head
retreats
slowly
leaving
a
little
bit
atop
the
beer
and
a
circular
ring
of
lace
i
detect
some
of
those
spice
aromas
of
ginger
clove
and
nutmeg
i
get
some
of
those
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
i
definitely
do
get
those
milk
stout
notes
with
the
chocolate
mild
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malt
notes
the
ginger
is
pretty
forward
and
i
do
get
some
of
those
other
spices
it
definitely
does
taste
sweet
which
lends
itself
more
to
sipping
thats
not
a
bad
idea
with
the
9
abv
the
body
is
medium
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
sipper
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
series
o
the
finish
to
this
beer
is
extraordinary
it
tastes
just
like
those
old
gingerbread
loaves
from
my
college
days
there
is
a
big
nostalgia
factor
to
this
beer
not
just
what
ive
mentioned
earlier
but
the
fact
that
the
huge
spice
flavour
is
heavily
reminiscent
of
a
circa
2006
old
fezziwig
ive
always
loved
this
offering
but
i
feel
its
lost
something
over
the
years
this
effort
is
bringing
it
back
really
good
stuff
i
wish
theyd
market
this
in
6packs
at
9
99
or
so
over
a
6
99
bomber
but
ill
take
it
this
is
classic
sam
adams
fans
of
spiced
winter
beer
will
love
this
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
of
spice
sweet
sugary
malts
light
chocolate
the
flavor
is
ok
a
bit
cloying
and
certainly
best
in
small
quantities
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
hardywood
gingerbread
stout
we
had
just
prior
medium
bodied
with
relatively
low
carbonation
alcohol
presence
not
as
well
disguised
as
it
could
be
overall
this
was
middle
of
the
road
mdo
a
nice
thick
stout
herbed
up
quite
nicely
and
balanced
with
the
molasses
like
sweetness
above
a
fabulous
bedrock
of
malt
and
rye
a
tough
combination
but
tackled
very
well
usually
these
gimicky
flavored
beers
end
up
tasting
like
crappy
beer
with
fake
flavor
tacked
on
not
so
in
this
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
much
better
than
i
scored
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
gingerbread
taste
kinda
like
picking
one
up
and
ripping
the
legs
off
of
those
little
bastards
and
screaming
in
victory
as
the
amputated
cookie
begs
for
its
life
but
alas
it
is
not
its
good
though
made
me
smile
but
that
may
also
have
been
the
9
abv
poured
thick
and
dark
brown
with
a
fizzy
quickly
dissappating
brown
head
smelled
of
gingerbread
appropriate
cinnamon
and
licorice
the
flavor
really
comes
out
as
this
warms
as
served
too
cold
brings
out
too
much
booze
the
gingerbread
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
anise
come
out
on
the
palate
to
create
a
great
winter
warmer
o
one
of
the
better
spice
beers
that
i
have
had
then
again
i
havent
had
too
many
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
it
is
the
perfect
after
dinner
beer
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
suffers
from
low
ratings
i
was
very
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
lots
of
gingerbread
spices
and
whatnot
cloying
sweetness
looks
good
smells
spicy
ginger
and
clove
cinnamon
is
clearlythere
i
dont
usually
like
beers
that
lack
any
semblance
of
hops
or
malt
and
this
one
doesnt
have
much
of
either
i
dont
know
what
i
expected
but
i
wasnot
impressed
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
good
inch
of
dark
tan
head
coffee
nut
and
spice
jump
out
of
the
aroma
dark
chocolate
hits
the
palate
first
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
rushing
in
to
support
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
a
rich
sweet
treat
thats
an
absolute
delight
for
the
holidays
o
if
the
ginger
were
kicked
up
dried
ginger
candied
ginger
throw
some
root
in
late
boil
throw
in
some
black
pepper
and
up
the
bitterness
id
call
this
an
allaround
winner
a
bit
of
bitter
orange
wouldnt
hurt
either
if
you
are
on
the
fence
about
spiced
beers
dont
try
this
one
overall
this
is
a
nice
christmas
beer
that
is
great
in
cold
weather
slow
sipping
but
very
flavorful
overall

pours
dark
with
little
head
smells
like
heavy
ginger
and
cinnamon
not
much
else
going
on
mouthfeel
more
like
a
porter
with
heavy
gingernutmegcinnamon
flavors
hit
what
they
were
going
for
thought
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
this
one
worked
out
with
the
stout
base
tastes
like
christmas
not
bad
very
dark
brown
to
black
in
the
glass
somewhat
opaque
but
it
does
have
faint
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
dark
khaki
and
rather
thick
but
it
will
fall
eventually
while
leaving
a
good
deal
of
lace
the
smell
is
great
for
a
spiced
winter
ale
all
of
the
spices
included
in
the
brewing
process
are
evident
in
the
aroma
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
malt
or
hops
in
smell
however
more
on
that
to
follow
like
the
smell
all
of
the
spices
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
the
stout
base
is
mediocre
at
best
as
a
result
i
have
to
say
that
the
balance
here
is
lacking
while
i
do
liked
spiced
ales
there
tends
to
be
a
very
fine
line
between
a
good
one
and
an
unbalanced
one
and
this
one
is
slightly
unbalanced
i
should
note
that
as
it
warms
it
does
seem
to
get
better
the
body
is
moderate
to
just
a
touch
light
of
moderate
with
a
finish
that
leaves
a
bit
of
the
spice
but
is
otherwise
clean
overall
while
i
like
it
i
think
this
could
have
been
a
bit
better
had
the
stout
been
more
assertive
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
didnt
mind
having
this
to
finish
a
thanksgiving
dinner
thi
sis
a
fun
beer
to
share
for
the
holidays
o
overall
this
beer
fits
the
season
very
well
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
served
in
a
tulip
pours
one
shade
shy
of
black
with
a
dense
three
inch
mochacolored
head
that
eventually
dissipates
into
a
broken
skim
and
a
tight
band
around
the
edges
thick
strands
of
lacing
are
revealed
and
exhibit
excellent
retention
nose
expresses
nutmeg
and
allspice
however
it
is
quite
overpowering
taste
consistent
with
nose
taste
is
just
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
with
a
suggestion
of
lactose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
even
carbonation
with
just
a
slight
prickle
and
some
residual
heat
attributable
to
the
overabundance
of
spice
well
this
is
a
gingerbread
cookie
punch
in
the
mouth
if
thats
your
thing
you
will
really
enjoy
this
beer
however
the
overly
spiced
character
really
takes
away
from
any
possible
subtleties
or
nuances
dark

rich
and
full
mouthfeel
decent
beer
overall
overall
excellent
stout
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
this
brew
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
bitter
for
the
style
it
really
needs
some
more
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
i
dont
need
any
more
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
i
like
the
concept
of
a
gingerbread
stout
unfortunately
my
complaint
here
is
this
beer
fell
short
of
its
mark
i
get
the
ginger
but
it
really
lacks
in
other
spices
that
would
bring
the
gingerbread
aspect
out
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
i
just
felt
it
needed
a
little
something
extra
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
thought
the
spices
were
pretty
good
and
it
really
did
smell
like
gingerbread
if
the
body
was
stronger
i
would
have
liked
it
even
more
i
would
still
probably
drink
it
again
o
didnt
enjoy
once
i
got
past
the
smell
would
not
drink
again
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
out
of
this
beer
black
pour
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
gingerbread
is
there
but
the
flavor
tasted
like
they
emptied
the
spice
cabinet
a
little
too
much
overpowering
on
the
cloves
and
ginger
taste
too
much
for
me
ill
pass
on
this
one
o
id
drink
this
during
the
winter
a
few
times
o
the
spices
really
clicked
for
me
making
this
beer
a
pretty
good
spiced
stout
for
the
holidays
overall
hard
to
drink
because
of
the
overwhelming
spice
notes
tastes
like
christmas
at
yankee
candles
make
sure
you
have
some
water
handy
overall
it
was
an
interesting
experience
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
again
at
least
it
had
a
cool
label
great
dessert
beer
overall
decent
attempt
at
the
concept
coming
from
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
many
sam
adams
this
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
better
products
that
ive
had
from
them
o
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
im
sure
i
judged
it
much
higher
than
my
peers
truth
be
told
for
a
9
beer
it
didnt
totally
live
up
to
its
name
but
it
wasnt
a
disappointment
this
beer
needs
to
be
served
during
the
holiday
season
among
other
flavorful
beers
its
not
overly
impressive
its
not
overly
impressionable
but
it
definitely
serves
its
purpose
overall
pretty
good
stout
very
interesting
combination
of
spices
with
a
stout
feels
and
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
stout
than
a
milk
stout
solid
not
must
have
o
this
beer
is
fun
its
experimental
its
very
christmasy
but
one
thing
it
is
not
is
tasty
weird
medicinal
nyquill
taste
almost
made
this
fucker
undrinkable
i
really
wish
the
taste
mimicked
the
smell
but
it
doesnt
pours
a
solid
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
forever
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
ginger
with
a
hint
of
clove
sneaking
out
there
might
be
more
in
there
but
i
cant
get
past
the
ginger
sauce
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
but
not
much
ginger
again
is
a
dominant
flavor
here
with
some
nutmeg
and
all
spice
rounding
out
the
spice
palette
theres
some
caramel
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
touch
of
lactose
and
a
bit
of
wet
dog
in
here
to
make
an
attempt
at
some
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spice
laden
mouthfeel
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
rank
it
right
up
there
with
cherry
wheat
the
ginger
is
strong
enough
that
instead
of
thinking
gingerbread
men
im
thinking
japanese
steak
house
ginger
sauce
great
idea
lackluster
results
overall
a
really
good
new
beer
from
sam
adams
love
some
spice
mixed
in
with
a
stout
body
kind
of
a
miss
on
this
one
while
i
like
the
spice
profile
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
gingerbread
cookie
and
the
stout
base
is
weak
for
a
holiday
brew
i
would
want
something
a
touch
more
warming
perhaps
use
their
holiday
porter
as
a
base
ive
decided
not
to
try
cellaring
this
one
because
the
abv
seems
under
control
to
my
palate
from
the
start
also
a
large
proportion
of
the
flavor
and
nose
balance
in
this
brew
depends
upon
spicing
elements
notorious
for
falling
apart
rapidly
in
the
cellar
this
beer
does
not
have
the
spicing
levels
exaggerated
enough
in
proportion
to
withstand
that
sort
of
degradation
it
drinks
to
my
palate
as
though
it
was
meant
to
be
consumed
fresh
despite
the
label
on
the
bottle
specifically
mentioning
cellaring
to
develop
flavors
im
happy
with
it
the
way
it
is
already
thank
you
very
much
o
great
concept
but
it
didnt
materialize
too
well
smell
is
incredible
but
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
damn
o
not
a
bad
holiday
brew
a
bunch
going
on
with
all
the
spices
but
still
a
sweet
enjoyable
sipper
that
i
would
try
again
this
one
appears
jet
black
upon
pour
thin
cocoa
colored
head
with
decent
retention
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
cloves
are
present
too
beneath
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
the
stout
character
is
hidden
beneath
the
assertive
spice
profile
and
doesnt
add
much
in
the
way
of
chocolate
or
roastiness
the
taste
is
again
heavy
on
spice
and
it
does
resemble
a
gingerbread
cookie
milk
sugar
also
makes
its
presence
know
as
there
is
a
smooth
creamy
sweetness
that
pairs
nicely
with
the
spices
i
get
some
roasted
barley
on
the
finish
but
this
is
largely
undermined
by
the
spice
profile
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
prickly
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
overall
pretty
nice
brew
from
sam
adams
i
was
attracted
by
the
novelty
of
this
brew
and
i
must
say
it
delivers
plenty
of
gingerbread
character
my
only
issue
is
the
forwardness
if
the
spices
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
over
the
top
this
type
of
beer
has
a
low
ceiling
so
ill
give
sam
adams
props
for
this
one
actually
at
times
tastes
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
it
was
interesting
although
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
may
be
something
good
with
more
body
o
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
and
it
wasnt
overly
expensive
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
anytime
soon
overall
this
beer
is
a
an
imperial
pumpkin
that
meets
a
imperial
stout
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
because
of
how
unique
it
is
why
i
am
rating
it
high
i
am
not
knocking
this
brew
at
all
i
would
grab
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
search
for
it
like
the
holy
grail
grab
a
glass
and
pour
and
try
it
yourself
salud
o
a
solid
stout
overall
i
wish
the
gingerbread
were
a
bit
more
present
in
the
flavor
and
the
body
was
a
bit
smoother
but
still
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
seasonal
style
o
this
a
my
first
sam
adams
in
about
56yrs
i
wish
their
regular
releases
would
mimic
these
special
small
batches
very
nice
job
even
though
i
believe
somebody
else
has
already
done
this
and
succeeded
kudos
o
the
ginger
is
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
taste
while
the
base
stout
is
too
thin
to
stand
up
to
the
spices
tastes
pretty
good
but
could
have
been
better
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
notes
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
similar
the
ginger
and
strong
cinnamon
notes
really
come
through
strongly
they
are
joined
by
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
character
that
melds
well
with
the
spices
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
spicy
stout
oh
yeah
like
i
could
pass
up
a
gingerbread
stout
this
one
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
highlighted
in
mahogany
topped
by
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
and
toasted
gingerbread
straightforward
but
decidedly
alluring
the
taste
generally
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
cocoa
but
everythings
toned
down
pale
in
comparison
to
what
my
nostrils
lapped
up
so
willingly
this
was
a
real
downer
lemme
tell
ya
the
body
is
a
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
pretty
tasty
little
stout
though
one
that
comes
across
slightly
muted
on
the
tongue
a
true
disappointment
for
me
i
still
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
but
i
believe
i
could
have
seriously
relished
this
stuff
had
things
gone
differently
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark

with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
gingerbread
cinnamon
nutmeg
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
sweet
and
spicy
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
molasses
and
cloves
to
the
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
a
bit
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
solid
overall
brew
i
might
have
to
buy
another
bottle
not
too
bad
for
7
99
its
a
goodbeer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
sure
if
i
will
revisit
this
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
just
to
give
it
another
go
but
it
just
doesnt
deliver
for
me
at
least
not
this
bottle
well
balanced
aroma
and
flavor
nice

roasted

nice
balance
and
not

very
sweet

taste
no
hop
presence
no
bitterness
drinks
like
a

great
transitional
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
bitter
beers
o
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
nice
and
smooth
with
big
roasted
flavors
nice
and
rich
goes
down
smoothly
with
plenty
of
flavor
great
tasting
chocolate
stout
the
best
out
of
the
beers
from
their
brewery
i
never
expected
one
so
divine
very
smooth
low

and
has
great
taste
not

has
a

beer

o
pretty
much
the
opposite
expirience
of
all
my
sa
brews
real
nice
mouthfeel
a
taste
is
off
and
smell
is
overwhelming
one
dimensional
brew
i
think
its
just
that
i
dont
like
the
style
i
am
lactose
intolerant
afterall
if
you
like
cream
stouts
try
this
opretty
good
definitely
worth
the
price
not
the
best
of
its
kind
by
any
means
but
definitely
worth
the
try
i
could
easily
see
myself
getting
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
if
i
didnt
have
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
available
locally
this
would
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
good
mouthfeel
thats
just
a
touch
sticky
and
creamy
medium
body
carbonation
on
the
lower
end
could
have
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
perhaps
a
little
watery
increased
creaminess
and
fullness
of
body
would
really
put
this
beer
over
the
top
not
great
but
certainly
quite
good
o
good
beer
might
actually
make
this
my
go
to
cream
stout
settles
great
on
the
tongue
easy
sipper
i
was
expecting
more
cream
flavor
and
im
glad
it
is
the
way
it
is
o
good
milk
stout
that
i
would
recommend
on
tap
at
the
dutch
pours
a
deep
brown
color
off
white
head
with
good
retention
scent
of
chocolate
roastiness
light
bread
taste
has
similar
notes
and
leans
sweet
as
expected
mouth
is
light
to
medium
bodied
but
becomes
drying
after
a
few
over
a
tasty
beer
for
this
rainy
dreary
day
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
im
not
getting
the
sweetness
normally
associated
with
a
cream
stout
although
i
enjoy
this
for
what
it
is
a
smooth
drinkable
stout
affordable
and
quaffable
two
things
i
appreciate
in
any
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
after
it
settles
this
beer
is
a
deep
rich
cookiecolor
of
black
the
head
is
thick
and
fluffy
almost
chunky
looking
like
an
oatmeal
stout
it
dissipates
to
a
thin
spotty
layer
and
leaves
random
lacing
the
smell
is
amazing
think
oreo
cookies
here
the
taste
is
just
as
appealing
as
the
smell
as
hints
of
cookies
sweet
cream
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
play
alongside
each
other
there
is
a
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
making
this
beer
go
down
way
too
easily
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
im
pondering
whether
or
not
it
would
be
wise
to
session
this
as
it
is
awfully
sweet
and
just
too
dessertlike
its
worth
drinking
again
either
way
its
not
topshelf
perfect
but
easily
worth
trying
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
in
terms
of
milk
stouts
this
is
my
second
and
i
much
prefer
the
left
hand
version
though
this
is
a
much
more
drinkable
easy
going
version
its
also
not
incredibly
sweet
though
certainly
noticeable
eating
it
with
a
piece
of
semisweet
chocolate
fudge
definitely
brought
it
to
a
whole
new
level
overall
to
round
it
up
this
is
a
excellent
example
of
a
stout
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
sa
collection
i
often
have
trouble
finding
this
beer
overall
i
am
bumping
the
score
due
to
the
improvements
with
warming
if
you
have
this
leave
it
alone
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
before
you
start
sipping
away
a
great
mouth
feel
and
nice
cream
stout
qualities
they
could
still
smooth
this
out
a
little
more
and
reduce
the
roasted
quality
while
bumping
the
creamer
taste
nice
worth
having
o
i
thought
this
was
an
average
beer
its
drinkable
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
transitional
beer
for
people
just
breaking
away
from
the
lighter
stuff
but
i
was
let
down
by
the
lack
of
aroma
and
flavor
again
not
that
i
picked
up
was
bad
but
they
were
way
too
subtle
for
my
taste
overall
im
still
not
adept
at
explaining
exactly
what
is
going

beers
creme
stout
is
exceptional
but
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
stout
i
like
big
heads
that
last
forever
and
velvety
smoothness
and
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
malts
upfront
followed
by
more
caramel
and
a
long
finish
of
slightly
bitter
chocolate
and
almonds
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
i
think
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout

also

this
is
a

this

almost
seems
like
a

but
really
one
of
the
better
brews
if
not
the
best
from
samuel
adams

that
also
helps
its
drinkability
though
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
for
sure
not
overly
thick
quick
finish
makes
it
very
sessionable
wnhmar

so
i
gave
it
a
high
rating
its
definately
not
disappointing
as
i
find
stouts
especially
to
be
superior
on

mouth
feel
for
this
beer
is
better
than
most
i
have

i
got
this
one
in
a
sams
variety
pack
and
have
been
enjoying
all
of
them
thus
far
tthegreymar

however
the
flavors
are
pretty
solid
the
only
real
complaint
i
have
is
the
smell
it
is
not
appealing
at
all
and
a
definate
coffee
note
has
a
nice
roasted
flavor
with
strong
hints
fo
coffee
has
a
slight

finish
very
well
balanced

love
this

the
look
was

was

the
taste
was

was

on

it

this

not

a
very
dark
beer
that
poured
with
medium
head
cream
i
guess
tasted
a
very
rich
chocolate
malty
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
aroma
was
very
nice
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
this
wouldnt
be
my
everyday
choice
for
me
but
i
liked
it
i
may
give
this
one
another
look
during
the
winter
drinkability
one
of
boston
greatest
beers
and
one
perfect
stout
i
drink
this
year
round
and
have
even
used
as
a
marinade
notes
i
really
should
not
be
having
this
beer
as
i
am
lactose
intolerant
this
beer
did
not
seem
as
milky
as
say
a
mackesonbut
it
was
indeed
better
it
was
worth
having
as
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
despite
the
risk
this
brew
was
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
i
am
used
to
in
a
stout
but
had
solid
stout
flavor
it
certainly
smelled
delicious
with
a
sweet
malty
scent
to
it
my
complaint
with
some
cream
stouts
is
the
diacetyl
but
this
one
was
sweet
without
having
that
buttery
flavor
the
aftertaste
left
a
little
to
be
desired
used
a
semiaggressive
pour
and
got
a
nice
light
browntan
head
that
was
about
two
and
a
half
fingers
thick
and
was
very
bubbly
the
body
of
the
beer
was
very
dark
almost
black
and
i
could
only
see
faint
hues
of
amber
on
the
side
of
the
beer
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
has
a
slight
coffee
aroma
followed
by
brown
sugar
molasses
and
even
some
chocolate
it
has
some
nice
thick
lacing
as
i
swirl
it
around
in
the
glass
its
very
smooth
mildly
art
on
the
side
of
your
tongue
and
sweet
over
all
it
has
a
mediumtolight
body
and
leaves
a
slight
roasted
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
not
my
favorite
stout
but
an
easy
one
to
drink
with
a
tasty
flavor
recommended
as
a
beer
if
you
like
guinness
but
not
russian
imperial
stouts
finish
is
pleasing
and
this
stout
is
very
drinkable
d
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
in
a
sitting
i
dont
think
it
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
but
i
could
enjoy
23
for
dessert
love
this
beer
will
buy
it
again
soon
this
was
a
nice
surprise
many
times
bbc
will
brew
a
flavorful
beer
which
is
still
safe
this
one
is
bold
all
the
way
and
one
of
the
best
sweet
stouts
ive
had
yet
black
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
after
pouring
from
a
bottle
hints
of
coffee
in
the
nose
clean
attack
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
smoky
flavors
and
a
relatively
clean
finish
considering
the
flavors
swirling
around
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
as
creamy
as
the
name
suggested
to
me
i
typically
enjoy
any
of
the
sam
adams
brewmasters
collection
but
this
one
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
a
sweet
brew
sweet
like
a
dopplebock
but
it
doesnt
bite
you
back
like
youd
hope
for
but
then
i
dont
know
that
any
milk
stout
does
its
great
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
even
on
a
cold
night
d
great
this
is
one
of
sas
best
brews
imo
this
beer
was
something
i
havent
had
before
it
smelled
great
and
tasted
good
the
mouthfeel
was
also
pretty
good
what
i
liked
the
most
about
the
cream
stout
is
the
after
taste
it
kinda
stayed
with
me
for
a
little
while
if
offered
this
beer
again
i
would
definitely
drink
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
traditional
appearance
of
opaque
black
body
with
slight
translucent
ruby
red
near
head
foamy
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
into
fine
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
different
than
many
other
stouts
ive
had
in
the
past
as
it
has
a
much
sweeter
smell
the
taste
is
incredible
its
more
carbonated
than
i
usually
like
in
a
stout
but
when
mixed
with
the
sweetness
it
seems
to
counterbalance
one
another
perfectly
a
pepperycarbonated
delivery
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
carries
most
of
the
effect
of
the
carbonation
but
still
feels
a
little
meatier
than
most
highly
carbonated
beers
overall
i
would
have
to
give
samuel
adams
high
praise
for
this
one
while
i
feel
as
though
many
of
their
other
beers
hang
in
the
shadow
of
higher
quality
import
beers
their
cream
stout
is
a
true
force
to
be
reckoned
with
oil
black
pour
slight
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
milk
chocolate
aroma
with
a
hint
of
espresso
much
more
pronounced
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
taste
plus
some
roasted
malt
and
even
a
hint
of
smoke
at
the
end
nice
carbonation
silky
smooth
very
enjoyable
very
good
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
sams
offerings
but
this
is
probably
the
second
best
if
not
the
best
bbc
offering
ive
had
goes
down
very
smooth
could
drink
this
all
night
good
carbonation
smooth
taste
of
toasted
chocolate
bread
hops
hops
and
malt
well
balanced
finished
almost
a
maple
syrup
as
it
warmed
excellent
brew
by
the
guys
at
sam
adams
this
was
a
tasty
brew
here
i
would
definitely
revisit
the
cream
stout
from
sam
adams
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
as
well
a
fine
sweet
stout
if
ever
i
had
one
other
than
that
a
good
beer
my
first
stout
and
definitely
not
my
last
d
definitely
would
drink
more
of
this
im
drinking
this
in
summer
and
its
actually
easier
to
drink
this
than
youd
expect
from
a
stout
would
happily
purchase
sixers
and
drink
this
straight
up
for
a
while
d
easier
to
put
back
than
a
lot
of
stouts
robust
but
not
overdone
on
the
roastedblackened
malts
excellent
balance
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
my
first
sweet
stout
so
i
may
just
not
be
a
fan
of
the
style
sweet
flavor
that
is
very
mild
there
is
a
bite
to
it
that
is
also
very
mild
creamy
medium
bodies
very
drinkable
this
is
definately
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
sam
adams
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
sweet
stout
but
it
is
still
quite
good
it
is
a
near
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
subtle
hops
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
balance
well
with
the
dry
burnt
malts
a
thin
body
also
make
sme
see
this
as
more
of
a
dry
stout
a
good
pub
beer
and
excellent
on
tap
dstyle
considered
this
would
not
be
the
1st
stout
i
reached
for
but
it
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
sam
adams
cream
stout
pours
a
deep
black
with
an
ample
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
faint
roastiness
as
well
as
some
caramel
the
flavor
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
bit
of
roasty
astringency
and
a
smooth
creaminess
i
dont
know
if
its
the
power
of
suggestion
but
the
beer
tastes
a
bit
milky
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
but
nothing
too
exciting
in
my
opinion
overall
this
was
a
very
good
stout
somewhat
lighter
than
most
but
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
i
will
definitely
drink
again
d
this
is
a
fine
beer
from
sam
adams
and
i
good
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
setting
i
dig
this
beer
the
most
with
over
600
reviews
nuff
said
a
salud
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
at
a
given
time
good
as
an
after
dinner
pint
pours
nice
and
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
great
smells
of
coffee
roasted
maltand
chocolate
blend
perfectly
together
did
not
have
a
heavy
feel
like
i
expected
and
was
easy
to
drink
tasted
as
it
smelled
with
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
hopps
and
espresso
overall
a
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
effort
for
the
style
made
a
good
addition
to
my
breakfast
after
a
17hour
workday
one
of
my
top
3
beers
from
sam
adams
i
love
this
beer
nearly
everything
you
want
in
a
milk
stout
drinkability
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
cream
stout
it
feels
a
little
more
fun
to
drink
than
a
stout
almost
how
great
it
felt
to
get
a
quarter
and
get
a
soda
from
the
gas
station
the
carbonated
tingle
and
the
distinct
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
keep
every
sip
fresh
in
my
mind
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
the
next
best
enjoyed
by

notched

with

and
a
half
tancolored
head
webs
of
sticking

with
excellent

present
during
the
session
scents
of

followed
by
a

intensive

flavors
of
roasted

a
hint
of
cream
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter

smooth

good
consistency
without
being
too
fullbodied
and
a
touch
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
brew
extremely
sessionable
ive
already
had
four
good
beer
that
my
bro
turned
me
on
to
would
drink
again
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
stout
it
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
it
has
lots
of
personality
and
is
nicely
complex
d
for
a
stout
this
is
the
most
drinkable
ive
ever
had
i
could
have
this
thing
anytime
any
place
stouts
dont
make
for
good
session
beers
but
this
one
comes
as
close
as
any
ive
had
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
stle
its
not
the
best
milk
stout
out
there
but
it
is
a
quality
brew
that
is
easy
on
the
pocket
drinkability
this
is
a
good
ale
and
it
is
entirely
sessionable
taste
is
also
weird
some
coffee
tones
chocolate
notes
and
more
of
a
bubbly
feel
than
a
smooth
stoutesque
consistency
not
sure
how
to
judge
this
i
dont
have
many
milkcream
stouts
and
i
didnt
much
care
for
this
didnt
seem
much
different
from
a
porter
actually
pours
black
with
a
descent
layer
of
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
tame
but
pleasant
with
notes
of
sweet
barley
molasses
coffee
and
faint
general
fruit
character
tastes
of
dark
roast
coffee
dried
dark
fruits
dates
cherry
and
drying
bitter
hops
imparting
a
little
citrus
towards
the
end
finishes
with
notes
of
dry
cocoa
powder
and
fruity
sweetness
full
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
weight
and
a
good
creamy
carbonation
nice
addition
to
the
winter
sampler
using
a
slow
pour
the
beer
develops
two
fingers
of
a
nice
brown
sugar
colored
head
beer
is
opaque
with
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
beer
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
a
rich
dark
chocolate
undertone
taste
was
about
the
same
malts
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
a
very
smooth
beer
creamy
but
not
real
heavy
carbonation
is
pretty
light
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
since
its
a
relatively
low
abv
definite
recommendation
paired
with
a
nice
cheesecake
or
afterdinner
cigar
and
youd
be
pretty
happy
this
is
certainly
good
enough
for
me
to
consider
putting
on
tap
next
fall
id
compare
it
with
berkshires
coffeehouse
overall
this
stouts
dark
appearance
hides
a
pearl
of
creamy
fruity
sweetness
pours
mostly
black
with
a
nice
medium
sized
lasting
head
smell
is
roasty
malt
and
sweet
cream
taste
is
nicely
medium
to
dark
roasty
malt
semi
creamy
milkiness
and
the
body
is
nice
and
neither
thin
nor
thick
pleasant
creamy
roasty
hazlenut
like
taste
with
soft
carbonation
and
extremely
mild
bitterness
that
is
hardly
there
at
all
no
harsh
or
strong
burnt
tastes
either
and
it
makes
this
a
delicious
and
friendly
beer
thanks
greg
its
a
good
beer
overall
but
nothing
spectacular
if
you
see
it
try
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
not
a
session
beer
as
most
stouts
are
not
but
i
would
drink
more
than
one
a
good
choice
for
the
winter
drinking
or
with
a
chocolate
dessert
a
decent
example
of
this
style
sam
adams
cream
stout
is
a
fantastic
tasting
beer
and
the
sam
adams
name
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
domestic
beers
with
this
selection
mmm
this
is
a
tasty
brew
the
beer
poured
with
a
deep
black
body
and
a
huge
light
brown
head
it
has
lots
of
rich
roasted
malt
and
strident
grain
with
hints
of
chocolate
it
also
featured
a
good
deal
of
english
hops
that
kept
the
beer
well
balanced
sa
has
a
very
good
beer
here
id
get
it
again
pretty
good
ale
theres
no
reason
to
make
excuses
for
having
this
beer
at
the
top
of
your
list
of
favorites
in
my
humble
opinion
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
body
is
full
but
i
feel
that
it
missing
something
not
sure
what
though
perhaps
its
the
carbonation
and
even
though
it
is
low
i
think
that
it
takes
away
from
the
would
be
otherwise
velvety
body
this
is
a
beer
that
id
not
be
opposed
to
buying
again
im
not
sure
how
this
is
sold
but
i
dont
think
that
is
in
sixers
dont
quote
me
on
that
though
i
dont
buy
or
drink
alot
of
sam
adams
beers
i
acquired
this
one
through
a
friend
i
think
that
id
rather
explore
more
of
this
style
before
coming
back
to
it
though
definitely
a
good
beer
though
dont
pass
this
one
up
notes
this
is
one
of
the
better
brewmaster
collection
brews
ive
had
from
sa
i
wish
it
had
better
bar
distribution
as
it
would
make
a
great
alternative
to
the
usual
dry
stout
triumvirate
of
guinnessmurphysbeamish
on
offer
at
most
places
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
very
creamy
and
smooth
its
carbonated
very
well
and
is
extremely
drinkable
its
tame
abv
adds
to
its
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
perhaps
samuel
adams
at
its
finest
drinkability
disappointing
to
say
the
least
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
good
sam
adams
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
stout
to
keep
in
your
fridge
to
hit
up
a
few
times
a
week
there
are
better
options
st
peters
cream
sierra
nevada
anchor
steam
are
just
a
few
that
provide
a
better
experience
in
my
opinion
drinkability
pretty
happy
with
this
brew
overall
think
ive
found
another
solid
go
to
for
mainstream
stouts
sa
usually
comes
through
pretty
solid
and
this
was
no
different
d
the
coffee
flavor
is
strong
but
its
a
good
beer
d
it
was
a
rich
and
creamy
brew
with
lots
of
chocolate
flavor
however
its
fine
malt
richness
also
made
it
a
very
one
dimensional
drink
one
and
done
brew
that
is
best
stocked
for
a
winter
brew
or
as
an
after
dinner
treat
overall
a
very
good
and
well
balanced
stout
well
worth
a
try
easy
to
finish
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
product
and
there
are
some
good
ones
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
top
notch
i
would
gladly
purchase
this
if
the
forementioned
were
not
available
taste
nice
roasted
coffee
introduction
that
quickly
mellows
out
into
a
thick
and
creamy
chocolate
character
finishes
with
more
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
dark
breads
this
cream
stout
has
a
nice
dark
color
and
a
rich
foamy
head
which
doesnt
last
real
long
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
both
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
creamy
taste
there
is
a
medium
mouthfeel
which
is
good
but
nothing
special
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
drinkable
beer

the

not

the

tastes
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
guinness
draught
quite
dry
for
a

but
goes
down
well
there
is
a
chocolate

taste
to
this
beer
which
lingers
long
after
a
sip
it
has
a
smooth
silk
feel
to
the
tongue
it
is
is
dark
as
night
color
it
is
an
easy
beer
to

and
one
well
worth
keeping
on

for
special
occasions
like
getting
off
from
work
pours

good

with

outstanding
looking

roasted

smell
with

of
chocolate
taste
is
great
with
roasted
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
touch
of
hops
to
round
it
out
only
drawback
is
what
i
perceive
as
lack
of
thickness
and
over
carbonation
mouthfeel
aside
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
ease
of
drinkability
allows
me
to
enjoy
several
in
one
sitting
great
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
truly
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
fantastic
beer
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
dvery
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
not
get
tired
makes
me
wonder
why
they
arent
pushing
this
line
more
than
some
of
there
other
beers
maybe
one
of
there
best
styles
brewed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
i
poured
this
into
my
sam
adams
glass
where
it
rested
a
nice
black
with
a
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
of
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
chocolate
and
some
hazelnut
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
is
roasted
malts
with
some
light
hops
nice
finish
with
some
bitterness
really
nice
brew
d
the
brew
was
very
rich
tasting
there
was
some
time
and
effort
that
went
into
making
this
d
i
find
the
cream
stout
to
be
a
very
good
offering
from
sam
adams
and
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
boston
brewer
it
tastes
good
looks
good
and
goes
down
smooth
to
recap
easily
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
and
very
nice
on
this
unusually
cold
winter
day
in
georgia
color
is
caramel
with
deep
ruby
hints
displaying
a
creamy
cocoa
milkshake
head
that
falls
quite
quickly
from
the
vigorous
pour
amazing
aroma
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
and
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
solid
taste
of
espresso
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
medium
bodied
with
nice
bitterness
that
surrounds
the
mouth
but
leaves
little
creaminess
this
cream
stout
is
an
impressive
representation
of
the
style
and
a
crowning
brew
in
sam
adams
rich
and
very
diverse
portfolio
plush
satisfying
and
delicious
the
sweetness
and
cream
parts
dont
exactly
translate
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
i
was
led
to
believe
bitter
chocolates
and
coffee
beans
are
still
present
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
richer
and
sweeter
from
this
one
its
still
a
quality
brew
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
though
i
usually
drink
beer
with
food
after
trying
several
miserable
pairings
with
food
its
hurting
the
drinkability
score
for
me
im
hard
on
creammilk
stouts
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
drank
alone
this
beer
isnt
bad
d
although
i
would
prefer
a
regular
stout
over
a
cream
version
definitely
one
to
fall
back
on
a
fine
brew
indeed
d
definitely
a
nice
stout
for
starters
black
colored
beer
with
a
chocolate
and
caramel
aroma
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
seen
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
foamy
head
with
good
staying
power
taste
also
is
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
its
as
smooth
as
helli
definetly
will
buy
this
again
and
will
hide
if
any
of
my
friends
are
over
d
really
liked
this
and
will
buy
again
hopefully
before
next
years
variety
pack
this
is
a
very
good
stout
though
it
seemed
more
like
a
dry
stout
than
a
cream
to
me
it
tasted
a
bit
like
a
cigar
which
makes
me
imagine
it
would
go
quite
good
with
one
not
sure
if
milksweet
stout
is
really
the
right
category
it
is
really
smooth
but
could
use
a
more
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
decent
readily
available
brew
for
a
cold
winter
night
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
wow
this
a
nice
stout
and
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
had
from
sam
adams
a
great
taste
and
low
abv
make
this
a
perfect
winter
sessioner
go
for
this
is
you
dig
stouts
its
decent
and
a
particularly
good
call
for
cold
winter
nights
which
this
is
not
and
which
seem
to
be
rarer
and
rare
lately
dont
they
dont
drink
and
review
poured
out
with
a
huge
head
that
was
wicked
dark
brown
but
surprisingly
laced
quickly
almost
looking
like
a
frappe
at
one
point
sharp
aromas
of
malt
and
chocolate
in
general
with
its
smell
more
caramelcoffee
flavors
in
the
taste
but
its
a
bit
weak
and
too
hoppy
near
the
finish
the
moutfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
it
has
decent
carbonation
overall
nothing
too
strong
or
out
there
for
typical
drinkers
but
i
wish
it
was
more
spectacular
notes
i
love
this
beer
not
only
my
stout
of
choice
but
maybe
the
beer
id
mention
in
the
whats
your
favorite
sam
adams
adds
and
unlike
most
stouts
not
a
bad
session
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
a
pleasing
aftertaste
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
good
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
a
glass
the
head
quickly
disappeared
it
appeared
kinda
syrup
like
while
flowing
out
of
the
bottle
the
smell
was
semi
sweet
but
not
too
overwhelming
it
taste
some
what
of
a
oatmealchocolate
stout
more
of
a
heavy
feel
to
it
but
not
too
heavy
that
you
couldnt
have
2
or
3
the
sam
adams
cream
stout
pours
a
nice
dark
ebony
black
with
a
frothy
brown
milkshake
looking
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
mocha
hints
of
espresso
the
taste
is
incredible
milky
smooth
with
roasted
aftertones
the
best
stout
ive
had
and
one
to
always
have
in
my
fridge
this
is
a
perfect
winter
beer
fire
sweats
and
a
nice
cream
stout
excellent
pours
a
dark
ebony
with
plenty
of
red
hues
went
put
against
the
light
nice
light
brown
two
finger
head
forms
at
the
top
of
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
muted
mainly
rich
malts
and
some
fruity
esthers
the
taste
was
slanted
towards
a
choclate
caramel
sweet
malt
base
however
by
the
middle
roasted
malts
and
charred
coffee
beans
broke
through
the
finish
was
rather
sweet
with
some
bitterness
like
i
said
dry
stouts
are
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
if
offered
one
of
sas
best
beers
true
to
its
namesake
this
brew
has
a
creamy
and
slightly
thick
consistency
along
with
moderate
carbonation
for
a
stout
slick
and
somewhat
juicy
in
the
finish
really
nice
as
i
said
probably
my
first
choice
from
sam
adams
d
a
very
good
beer
would
be
good
with
dessert
or
for
relaxing
they
need
to
make
the
mix
pack
bigger
for
the
holidays
or
i
need
to
buy
more
next
year
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
stout
i
wish
it
had
been
a
little
thicker
but
definitely
worth
drinking
again
and
could
certainly
be
used
for
session
drinking
given
the
abv
black
with
a
nice
pillowy
light
tan
head
roasty
chocolaty
with
a
lactoselike
sweet
smelling
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
sweet
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
mix
with
only
a
tiny
bit
of
roastiness
in
there
as
well
giving
it
a
stout
feel
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
thick
making
this
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
and
not
too
hard
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
sa
notes
a
nicely
done
englishstyle
stout
low
in
alcohol
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
character
d
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
but
the
sweetness
kind
of
kills
it
for
me
too
much
of
a
good
thing
d
while
this
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
prefer
my
stouts
and
porters
it
is
a
fairly
nice
beer
i
think
this
would
make
a
better
stand
alone
beer
or
an
after
dinner
beer
due
to
the
flavors
and
sweetness
pours
black
with
a
small
tan
head
with
good
lacing
on
the
sides
and
surface
nose
is
chocolatey
with
dark
fruit
notes
and
an
underlying
sweetness
dark
roasted
malt
in
the
front
with
a
bit
of
coffee
flavor
becoming
sweeter
with
some
herbal
hops
light
lingering
bitterness
mostly
from
the
roasted
malt
pretty
balanced
and
tastey
medium
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
a
very
solid
beer
overall
and
one
of
my
dads
favorites
i
tried
this
in
late
december
its
freezing
cold
outside
and
this
is
a
great
stout
for
the
season
i
was
expecting
something
smooth
light
and
sweet
but
what
i
got
was
a
deep
rich
complex
bitter
roasted
and
smoky
treat
that
i
will
definitely
search
out
in
the
future
drinkability
very
good
had
this
from
the
winter
pack
but
is
brewed
year
round
would
purchase
this
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
could
stand
to
be
a
tad
sweeter
but
it
makes
for
good
drinking
on
a
cold
winter
evening
part
of
the
winter
seasonal
pack
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
smokestack
chalice
poured
a
strikingly
dark
black
with
a
3
inch
billowy
head
head
subsided
and
left
an
off
white
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
all
the
way
down
aroma
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
a
little
weak
there
is
definitely
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
it
but
it
fades
to
an
astringent
taste
almost
like
overly
strong
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
dry
finish
well
im
not
going
to
buy
a
sixer
of
it
but
i
will
drink
it
if
its
in
the
winter
mix
again
next
year
last
of
the
bottle
of
my
winter
mixed
pack
and
i
think
i
saved
the
best
for
last
pours
dark
as
night
with
nice
offwhite
head
almost
looks
nitrolike
with
the
thick
creamy
head
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smell
has
much
more
of
a
dark
sense
to
it
than
some
other
stouts
a
dark
coffee
and
some
chocolate
taste
is
exceptional
roasted
grains
coffee
chocolate
all
the
flavors
you
expect
to
have
in
a
stout
and
then
a
touch
of
cream
as
expected
by
the
name
its
subtle
but
there
is
a
sweetness
to
it
full
bodied
and
thick
leaves
a
somewhat
oily
feeling
overall
a
terrific
beer
and
i
think
the
highest
yet
ive
rated
from
sammy
a
i
have
to
admit
ive
had
this
brew
a
bunch
of
times
over
the
years
and
have
never
given
it
enough
respect
it
is
a
seriously
dialed
in
milk
stout
now
i
have
to
think
about
this
one
really
pretty
nice
d
although
id
like
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
my
stomach
disagrees
with
that
thought
still
it
goes
down
easily
enough
and
more
would
definately
be
an
option
if
eating
a
meal
poured
this
beer
into
a
tasting
glass
it
is
a
very
nice
looking
beer
dark
and
hearty
looking
creamy
tan
head
that
stands
2
inches
in
the
tasting
glass
and
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
the
nose
is
initially
coffee
and
fig
notes
then
some
faint
burnt
smokiness
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
first
a
hit
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
then
a
nice
subtle
hoppy
bite
to
round
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
and
creamy
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
i
drank
2
over
the
course
of
this
review
and
plan
on
keeping
going
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
complex
and
well
balanced
and
indulgently
sweet
and
creamy
nice
dark
black
coffee
color
and
thick
foamy
tan
head
i
detect
a
sweet
carmel
and
coffee
aroma
and
i
think
im
picking
up
a
smokey
scent
as
well
tastes
like
toasted
sweet
malty
coffeecarmel
with
a
very
nice
lowcarbonation
creamy
texture
quite
easy
to
drink
the
beer
that
this
beer
most
reminds
me
of
is
mackesons
xxx
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
this
is
a
very
good
example
mouthfeel
here
is
not
what
i
was
looking
for
feels
pretty
thin
for
a
regular
let
alone
a
cream
stout
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
as
well
though
it
has
its
faults
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
you
like
darker
beers
pick
up
the
sam
adams
winter
mixed
pack
and
give
this
one
a
try
d
this
is
just
another
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
i
love
their
winter
seasonals
better
than
their
summers
eric
how
exactly
this
is
a
cream
stout
is
beyond
me
but
its
a
solid
stout
with
all
the
usual
offerings
dark
character
roasted
malt
with
coffee
undertones
set
in
taste
is
full
and
goes
down
with
a
malty
finish
nice
balance
of
hops
at
the
end
slightly
thin
tasting
for
a
stout
which
i
usually
find
to
be
fuller
in
character
a
nice
beer
though
solid
as
any
stout
and
a
great
addition
for
the
winter
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
jet
black
body
with
brown
tracings
of
a
halfinch
headattractive
toasted
vs
roastedcaramel
chocolate
and
a
bit
buttery
creamy
indeed
lightly
carbonated
medium
bodied
light
alcohol
notes
lightly
sweet
and
bitter
balance
subtle
in
character
too
subtle
the
brew
cut
through
my
cold
to
present
a
wellbalanced
stout
that
is
softly
drinkable
and
a
quality
beer
that
is
readily
available
a
nice
inclusion
to
the
brewerys
winter
sampler
d
overall
a
good
beer
if
i
ever
saw
a
six
pack
probably
not
i
might
pick
one
up
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
softer
as
the
carbonation
is
a
little
much
its
also
pretty
thin
for
a
stout
but
it
is
light
in
the
alcohol
dept
after
all
still
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
would
make
a
solid
session
beer
this
really
isnt
a
bad
stout
at
all
not
sure
its
up
there
with
the
sammy
smith
oatmeal
as
far
as
sweet
stouts
go
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
drinkability
quaffable
wellbalanced
and
tasty
otherwise
give
me
a
left
hand
milk
stout
over
this
any
day
d
pretty
smooth
for
a
stout
but
a
little
acrid
for
my
tastes
d
quite
drinkable
it
works
as
a
dessert
but
would
pass
during
a
night
of
stout
drinking
too
very
drinkable
low
alcohol
with
robust
bitter
characteristics
and
nicely
balanced
malt
flavors
quite
tasty
and
very
smooth
the
beer
took
a
little
getting
used
to
but
like
all
good
things
to
come
it
won
out
in
the
end
flavors
lasted
and
sip
after
sip
became
more
satisfying
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
one
of

adams

offerings

a
complete
black
with
a
tan
colored

slowly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer

is
pretty
good
some
spotty

is
a
milky
coffee
aroma

some
gooey

for
some
reason
a
faint

of
alcohol

flavors
up

aftertaste
is
dark
coffee
with
a

nice
solid
flavor
that
fits
the
style
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
well
creamy
with
an
almost
full
body
carbonation
is
mild
at
most
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
glad
this
is
easily
available
in
my
area
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
i
would
definetly
recommend
and
look
forward
to
having
a
few
more
of
in
the
future
d
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
drinkability
very
high
very
good
beer
that
drinks
very
smoothly
i
am
thrilled
that
this
beer
is
available
in
the
winter
mix
pack
since
it
has
been
discontinued
in
my
area
one
of
my
first
favorite
beers
and
still
holds
up
very
well
after
a
few
years
absense
highly
recommended
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
mfd
very
creamy
indeed
almost
nitro
creamy
powdery
feel
stays
on
the
palate
medium
low
carbonation
this
feels
like
a
meal
in
itself
pours
out
a
dark
almost
purplish
brown
with
a
creamy
cafe
au
lait
head
and
some
hereandthere
lacing
smell
is
roast
forwarded
with
more
subtle
whiffs
of
chocolate
and
an
odd
sweaty
sock
aroma
flavor
has
a
colalike
sweetness
with
bigger
chocolate
than
in
the
smell
the
sock
offflavor
is
not
as
prominent
in
the
taste
roast
comes
out
more
towards
the
middle
and
sticks
around
on
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
not
all
that
thick
considering
the
sweetness
ok
drinkability
i
was
interested
in
having
this
after
not
having
drunk
it
in
years
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
again
any
time
soon
wow
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
boston
brewing
this
really
goes
to
show
that
larger
breweries
can
still
produce
outstanding
products
i
think
other
american
brewers
could
take
a
note
from
the
relatively
low
abv
of
this
brew
big
flavors
can
come
in
smaller
packages
delicious
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
give
me
this
beer
again
any
day
highly
recommended
you
wont
taste
much
if
you
drink
it
cold
straight
from
the
fridge
but
if
you
let
it
sit
out
510
minutes
and
start
on
it
when
its
cool
it
will
be
an
absolute
treat
flavor
holds
a
bitterness
up
front
of
the
hops
which
mellow
allowing
the
malts
and
chocolate
notes
come
through
nearly
perfectly
balanced
flavor
a
very
nice
beer
this
was
part
of
the
winter
12
pack
as
an
added
bonus
the
12er
was
only
9
99
at
my
local
supermarket
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
medium
sized
head
the
aroma
was
swet
roasted
malt
and
coffee
a
taste
of
espresso
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
nice
and
sweet
a
little
hop
bitterness
late
a
very
smooth
enjoyable
beer
the
roasted
malts
are
very
soft
in
this
stout
its
a
glass
of
velvet
really
mediumbodied
rather
than
thick
thats
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
d
extremely
drinkable
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quite
well
with
dark
chocolate
or
a
nice
smoked
meat
yeah
im
impressed
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
medium
head
smells
like
burnt
malt
and
caramel
but
slightly
taste
is
very
smooth
creamy
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
unsweentened
cocoa
in
the
background
overall
a
definite
winner
this
is
something
i
hope
is
available
all
year
around
this
is
the
kind
of
stout
guiness
should
be
making
damn
good
beer
go
get
it
now
drinkability
very
nice
this
is
a
good
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
it
is
a
smoothe
drinking
stout
that
is
low
in
alcohol
and
has
lots
of
deep
flavors
a
good
choice
for
a
milk
stout
overall
its
a
beer
id
drink
again
but
not
really
seek
out
im
happy
to
see
it
in
the
winter
classics
12
pack
this
year
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
not
too
sweet
just
the
right
blend
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
malts
to
make
for
a
great
selection
any
time
of
year
the
roasted
coffee
flavor
is
very
strong
in
the
taste
too
strong
probably
it
dominates
everything
else
its
a
smooth
drink
though
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
another
just
wish
it
wasnt
quite
so
one
dimensional
drinkablity
is
high
very
tasty
but
light
and
low
abv
this
one
pours
a
nice
black
with
brown
around
the
edges
and
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
the
head
sticks
around
nicely
the
smell
is
upfront
roasted
black
coffee
and
black
malt
followed
by
chocolate
malt
its
slightly
fruity
and
a
bit
smoky
as
well
the
taste
is
dominated
by
coffee
like
flavors
it
is
actually
a
bit
astringent
if
its
too
cold
but
as
it
warms
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
malt
comes
through
but
again
it
is
dominated
by
bitter
dark
malt
there
is
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
in
there
too
but
it
is
definitely
hidden
underneath
the
roasted
black
malts
do
all
the
talking
here
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
especially
and
soft
especially
when
warm
not
as
soft
as
a
nitro
stout
but
remains
a
bit
more
prickly
which
i
like
this
beer
leaves
a
long
lingering
coffee
flavor
in
the
mouth
for
me
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
im
not
the
biggest
coffee
fan
and
after
one
or
two
i
could
see
the
coffee
flavor
turning
me
off
a
bit
but
still
this
is
a
great
stout
one
that
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
earlier
and
will
probably
try
again
overall
this
was
a
good
cream
stout
i
would
be
interested
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
mackeson
they
are
made
at
the
same
brewery
this
seemed
a
bit
light
and
might
be
my
choice
if
i
want
a
sweet
stout
that
wont
fill
me
up
but
i
would
take
a
mackeson
or
st
peters
if
want
a
bit
more
flavor
i
think
i
found
a
new
beverage
to
have
for
breakfast
and
thats
sam
adams
cream
stout
its
drinkable
not
heavy
and
damn
tasty
looking
for
a
beer
to
turn
a
coffee
lover
onto
this
would
be
my
pick
strong
smell
of
roasted
malts
tastes
like
roasted
malts
and
coffee
then
turns
to
a
flavor
i
cant
quite
place
molasses
or
burned
caramel
quite
flavorful
and
interesting
but
it
isnt
quite
as
tasty
as
it
smells
at
least
for
me
first
cream
stout
ive
had
though
so
i
have
no
comparison
or
feel
for
the
style
mouthfeel
has
the
same
consistency
as
most
of
the
other
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
id
have
this
again
this
beer
is
very
rich
making
it
hard
to
drink
a
large
amount
of
however
a
good
drinkability
for
a
cold
winter
night
drinkability
if
this
beer
didnt
have
an
infatuation
with
sour
roasted
malts
i
would
have
consistered
this
beer
more
drinkable
i
might
give
this
beer
another
chance
down
road
i
just
hope
by
that
time
they
have
stopped
souring
their
roasted
malts
in
this
beer
hooray
for
the
appearance
but
neh
for
everything
else
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
every
time
i
have
one
i
wonder
why
its
not
in
my
fridge
more
often
drinkability
a
pleasant
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
down
for
me
its
one
of
the
top
samuel
adams
beers
my
second
sampling
from
the
07
winter
sampler
pours
a
dark
almost
pitch
reddishblack
w
a
frothy
tan
head
and
bubbles
of
oilslick
black
floating
in
it
dissapates
too
quick
to
enjoy
this
visual
quality
some
broken
lacing
as
well
not
a
strong
smell
mostly
a
vinous
chocolatyburnttoast
aroma
no
hop
to
speak
of
a
thin
tart
roasted
malt
flavor
some
almost
smoky
notes
burnt
chocolate
perhaps
if
the
flavor
was
stronger
it
would
be
more
identifiable
dry
light
bodied
brew
decent
co2
level
very
drinkable
tho
not
as
good
as
most
of
this
style
ive
tried
since
this
is
most
likely
the
first
sweet
stout
many
drinkers
will
have
it
is
a
good
introductory
effort
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
bitter
chocolate
charcoal
and
mocha
the
taste
is
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
roasted
coffee
a
slight
rustlike
characteristic
and
some
milky
sweetness
the
feel
is
surprisingly
crisp
which
leads
to
a
lighter
feel
finishes
on
the
bitter
side
a
solid
stout
more
on
the
bitter
side
than
i
expected
but
good
flavors
this
is
such
a
refreshing
beer
it
is
very
different
from
other
stouts
and
it
has
a
smoothness
like
no
other
highly
recd
drank
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
march
2008
bestby
date
pours
a
delicious
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
small
offwhite
head
pretty
good
retention
smells
sweet
milky
oats
hints
of
coffee
toasted
grains
taste
is
much
of
the
same
some
dairy
coffee
dark
grains
clean
almost
dark
chocolatey
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
for
a
stout
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
like
still
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
2
finger
tan
head
dark
brown
almost
black
color
smell
is
toasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
a
little
sweetness
taste
is
also
of
toasty
malts
coffee
with
a
little
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
decent
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
then
a
couple
overall
not
my
fav
but
goes
well
with
the
holiday
sampler
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
mildly
bitter
and
dry
stout
but
is
well
crafted
and
complex
in
flavor
somewhat
unique
in
character
this
is
a
stout
that
brings
out
the
dark
brew
lover
in
any
drinker
cheers
this
is
an
excellent
stout
it
pours
a
really
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
caramel
head
that
isnt
too
thick
but
not
too
thin
either
it
smells
of
rish
dark
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
phenomenal
it
tastes
like
rich
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
chocolate
and
cream
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
just
as
good
and
it
goes
down
really
smooth
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
which
makes
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
try
this
if
you
have
the
chance
delicious
good
allaround
stout
from
sam
adams
winter
classics
this
pours
a
thick
finger
of
nice
frothy
tan
head
over
a
deep
brown
body
and
has
a
prominent
chocolate
coffee
aroma
its
flavors
are
good
with
the
chocolate
mixing
well
with
strong
sumatra
coffee
all
wrapped
in
a
nice
roasted
taste
overall
cream
stout
is
easy
and
smooth
to
consume
a
good
steady
stout
and
solid
addition
to
the
winter
classics
other
stouts
are
bolder
in
taste
and
flavors
such
as
coffee
but
cream
stout
is
easily
accessible
for
stout
lovers
and
newcomers
alike
not
overpowering
but
a
good
beer
and
for
strangers
to
stout
a
very
nice
introduction
one
could
do
much
worse
well
worth
a
try
creamy
with
a
profound
chocolatesweet
taste
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
this
is
defintely
a
unique
beer
great
with
chocolate
or
anything
sweet
this
is
a
robust
sugarey
and
pleasing
sample
of
a
really
good
stout
despite
not
being
a
particular
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
after
already
having
a
couple
of
beers
so
that
the
bitter
aftetaste
was
cancelled
out
and
the
sweet
roasted
chocolate
flavor
predominated
my
taste
buds
had
this
with
a
butterfinger
and
a
snickers
and
really
enjoyed
it
certainly
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
stouts
a
good
classic
sam
adams
brew
drinkability
i
like
it
and
could
drink
maybe
2
of
these
but
slowly
cause
this
beer
isnt
my
personal
taste
the
taste
is
so
complex
that
its
best
savored
dont
know
the
style
that
well
but
this
seems
to
hit
it
well
sweet
but
retains
the
elements
of
a
stout
thick
mouthfeel
not
too
complex
d
a
fair
stout
pretty
good
a
nice
beer
to
put
in
the
mixpack
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
a
sixer
of
it
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
overall
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
the
freshness
really
comes
across
in
the
mild
nutty
flavors
its
a
very
soft
and
dainty
stout
with
lots
of
full
flavors
nice
job
bbc
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
approachable
stout
had
this
with
a
couple
of
fresh
baked
cookies
that
were
still
warm
very
very
good
dark
chocolate
brown
color
very
opaque
as
well
the
color
of
the
head
reminds
me
of
the
color
of
the
foam
from
a
root
beer
float
and
left
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
bottle
can
definitely
smell
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
coming
of
it
very
fragrant
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
a
bout
what
i
would
expect
for
a
stout
it
is
kinda
sweet
at
the
beginning
with
a
kick
of
alcoholic
bitterness
at
the
end
yet
there
seems
to
be
a
strange
carbonation
that
runs
over
the
tongue
that
just
doesnt
sit
with
me
quite
right
taste
wise
has
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
for
sure
yet
i
feel
that
one
can
taste
the
coffee
more
than
anything
else
maybe
a
little
bit
of
caramel
as
well
can
really
tell
that
there
are
some
malts
in
here
yet
they
dont
seem
to
be
too
strong
sam
adams
has
pleased
me
once
again
this
is
a
great
brew
nice
to
drink
and
very
affordable
for
the
price
i
rank
this
highly
i
prefer
hitachino
lacto
stout
but
cannot
afford
to
drink
that
daily
once
of
the
better
milk
stouts
out
there
impressive
this
beer
is
damn
good
and
my
local
kroger
stocks
it
religiously
so
im
in
luck
sam
cream
stout
pours
an
opaque
espresso
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
sweet
malt
in
abundance
with
a
warm
roasting
element
in
the
mouth
relatively
thin
in
the
mouth
this
stout
lacks
the
body
and
form
of
its
more
masculine
competitors
but
not
a
bad
version
nevertheless
easily
drinkable
decent
stout
character
and
mass
availability
make
for
ez
relief
when
in
need
of
a
dark
one
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
goes
down
a
lot
smoother
than
most
of
the
stouts
i
enjoy
d
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
light
and
clean
stout
that
packs
in
just
enough
flavor
to
justify
its
color
i
would
almost
think
of
this
as
a
nut
brown
stout
pours
black
as
night
with
a
very
think
tan
head
lasting
a
long
time
full
of
roasted
aroma
as
if
you
were
drinking
a
pot
cof
dark
roasted
coffie
there
is
hints
of
munich
malt
and
plenty
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
with
not
much
hop
aroma
or
flavor
but
enough
to
balance
this
beer
out
creamy
and
a
full
body
mouthfeel
lighty
carbonated
very
tasty
nice
dark
color
along
with
good
stout
head
and
lacing
has
an
excellent
scent
very
deep
and
rich
with
wonderful
coffee
and
roasted
barley
aromas
it
has
a
good
flavor
nice
and
deep
along
with
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
although
its
not
the
best
stout
on
the
market
its
worth
a
try
definitely
in
the
holiday
pack
and
even
as
a
six
pack
by
itself
d
highly
drinkable
session
beer
a
lighter
stout
that
goes
down
easy
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
forming
a
thick
creamy
1
inch
tan
head
medium
spots
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fantastic
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
also
does
not
dissapoint
roasted
malts
chocolate
light
coffee
and
a
hint
of
caramel
not
too
complex
but
completely
delicious
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
low
abv
and
incredible
flavor
makes
for
extremely
high
drinkability
and
an
ideal
session
ale
overall
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
ever
since
i
started
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
and
i
can
safely
say
that
i
was
not
dissapointed
wonderful
full
flavor
and
decent
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
a
great
sam
adams
brew
and
my
favorite
by
far
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
a
slight
cherry
tint
in
the
light
there
was
a
nice
cream
colored
12in
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
even
some
dark
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
taste
of
coffee
but
no
real
sweetness
to
this
beer
the
hops
were
absent
as
well
leaving
a
coffee
flavored
after
taste
lightly
carbonated
this
was
a
heavier
beer
not
recommended
for
a
night
of
drinking
but
on
a
cool
fall
night
it
hit
the
spot
nicely
i
will
have
to
say
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
though
a
solid
beer
most
of
sas
older
examples
i
dont
care
much
for
but
this
is
right
on
the
style
final
note
ive
only
had
a
few
milk
stouts
and
i
dont
really
care
much
for
them
but
of
what
ive
had
this
seems
pretty
much
run
of
the
mill
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
comes
up
short
on
flavor
and
body
i
think
its
worth
a
try
and
its
an
easily
drinkable
but
there
is
lots
of
room
for
improvement
wow
pours
coke
black
with
a
tan
head
creamy
head
leaves
a
great
sheet
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
tastes
the
same
as
smell
but
no
sign
of
bitterness
just
a
great
smooth
stout
finishes
a
bit
sweet
but
i
like
that
in
a
stout
drinkability
great
beer
enjoyed
it
a
lot
very
easy
to
drink
which
is
surprising
considering
how
much
is
going
on
in
this
beer
this
is
yet
another
great
offering
from
sam
adams
definitely
try
this
one
i
hope
my
bottle
didnt
go
bad
or
anything
i
now
see
the
drink
by
date
is
september
2007
so
im
technically
in
the
range
but
i
think
ill
give
this
another
chance
soon
d
a
very
sessionable
stout
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
get
sick
due
to
the
light
nature
of
the
brew
overall
impression
nice
and
drinkable
this
is
a
quality
offering
with
a
high
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
should
be
fuller
for
a
crean
stout
in
my
opinion
i
think
i
lucked
out
on
some
very
good
brews
from
sam
adams
based
on
such
a
random
selection
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
looks
a
deep
mahogany
on
the
pour
but
appears
black
in
the
glass
with
a
tan
twofinger
viscous
head
the
smell
is
very
malty
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
with
the
chocolate
being
pretty
pronounced
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
dont
find
the
taste
as
good
as
the
smell
the
initial
taste
has
a
bit
of
nondescript
hops
to
it
and
the
chocolate
is
more
of
an
aftertaste
than
anything
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
this
beer
was
almost
gone
by
the
time
i
finished
the
review
making
it
very
drinkable
indeed
overall
a
very
excellent
offering
by
sa
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
abv
could
be
knocked
up
a
little
very
sessionable
as
a
result
however
overall
very
very
pleasing
and
a
nice
surprise
in
this
offering
it
was
my
first
one
of
the
mixed
pack
and
kinda
glad
it
was
as
this
was
outstanding
i
wished
i
had
it
a
little
later
as
it
would
have
made
for
a
fine
dessert
offering
however
where
it
placed
was
just
perfect
i
really
look
forward
to
having
another
at
some
point
try
this
one
if
you
can
really
good
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
this
was
another
great
offering
from
boston
beer
i
enjoyed
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
today
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
nice
sweet
stout
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
coming
winter
for
sure
this
was
my
first
cream
stout
ill
have
to
get
some
more
guinness
extra
stout
and
compare
very
smooth
and
creamy
as
you
would
expect
another
fine
brew
from
sam
adams
nice
thick
dark
pour
deep
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
extremely
crisp
malt
aroms
are
present
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
body
is
full
but
not
too
filling
taste
was
nice
bittersweet
with
just
a
hint
of
a
lactose
flavor
not
bad
at
all
the
finish
is
dry
with
undertones
of
tabacco
and
cocoa
powder
it
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
was
surprised
at
how
flavorful
this
sam
adams
brew
turned
out
to
be
12oz
brown
bottle
from
rsvp
in
portland
pitch
black
body
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
rubyred
highlights
with
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
with
vanilla
and
lactose
notes
tastes
roasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
vanilla
and
lactose
with
no
one
flavor
overwhelming
another
a
rich
full
body
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
to
cleanse
the
palate
though
the
roastiness
sticks
around
for
a
while
an
outstanding
stout
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
m
the
flavor
hits
the
front
of
the
mouth
with
some
nice
acrid
coffee
notes
backed
by
plenty
of
chocolate
and
a
noticable
hop
note
i
cant
bring
myself
to
call
the
taste
amazing
but
its
pretty
good
the
moutfeel
is
somewhat
of
a
low
point
but
it
does
get
the
job
done
for
the
style
its
a
mediumlight
body
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
it
has
a
great
bitter
finish
all
in
all
this
is
a
super
aromatic
tasty
complex
stout
for
a
sweet
stout
it
definately
captured
my
attention
and
ill
most
likely
have
one
again
sometime
soon
12oz
fresh
samplenov
07
notched
that
pours
the
darkest
mahogany
and
almost
black
the
head
is
semicreamy
with
bubbles
too
big
to
give
a
mousselike
extra
creaminess
found
on
say
a
nitrotap
stout
or
a
bottle
conditioned
russian
imperial
still
a
swirl
of
the
glass
shows
enough
creaminess
to
warrant
the
name
as
i
dont
believe
lactose
is
used
in
this
recipe
aroma
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
is
just
superb
its
roasty
and
semisweet
taste
showcases
the
semisweet
roastiness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
from
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
for
the
style
but
doesnt
detract
right
away
my
mind
swims
with
food
pairings
ranging
from
starters
such
as
beef
stews
to
main
courses
of
roasted
or
bbqd
caramelized
meats
to
desserts
of
chocolate
or
vanilla
at
the
moment
its
best
pairing
is
my
glass
and
my
company
because
its
also
a
great
sipper
taste
is
quite
balance
nuanced
and
full
this
isnt
the
in
your
face
impy
stout
its
a
subtle
buddy
roasty
malts
blending
with
a
creamy
lactose
like
chocolate
milk
and
coffee
there
must
be
some
hops
creating
this
nice
bittering
but
the
theme
here
is
smooth
oh
so
smooth
creamy
silky
with
the
fairest
of
effervescence
this
is
a
tasty
stout
as
easily
enjoy
in
june
as
in
january
beautiful
dark
pour
with
nice
creamy
head
roasted
malt
flavors
are
evident
with
hints
of
coffee
very
smooth
and
drinkable
slightly
sweet
finish
possibly
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
very
good
beer
that
i
have
had
on
numerous
occasions
reasonalbly
priced
and
easy
to
find
even
in
beer
purgatory
mississippi
poured
a
pitch

with

that
settled
fairly
quickly

lightly
roasted

tastes
amazing
chocolate
coffee
a
cloying
sweetness
all
compete
for
your
attention
nice
and
smooth
mouthfeel
good
body
nice
creamy
texture
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
could
easily
make
this
an
everyday
beer
d
i
can
probably
drink
2
of
these
a
bit
thicker
but
not
in
a
bad
way
everything
tastes
so
good
though
i
would
probably
want
to
drink
more
but
would
also
probably
feel
full
aroma
is
very
strong
and
smoky
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
just
screams
drink
me
it
pours
a
beautiful
sable
nearly
black
and
opaque
with
a
thick
tan
head
flavor
does
not
disappoint
it
is
rich
and
smoky
with
whispers
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
goes
down
smooth
and
lively
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
like
burnt
coffee
that
has
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
it
a
must
for
any
stout
and
porter
fanatic
d
for
drinking
it
on
a
summer
night
i
was
somewhat
surprised
it
was
great
i
am
a
big
stout
fan
and
will
probably
down
quite
a
few
of
these
this
summer
and
continuing
on
i
loved
it
delicious
solid
representation
and
fairly
inexpensive
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
and
has
good
head
formation
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
for
a
sam
adams
beer
aroma
is
suprisingly
roasty
and
sweetly
pleasant
flavor
has
a
lot
of
off
notes
the
roastiness
is
there
but
the
entire
presentation
is
a
bit
off
i
get
some
chemicalness
some
sourness
and
some
supersweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
quite
dry
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
sam
adams
products
but
i
found
this
one
quite
passable
definitely
recommended
d
this
would
be
an
excellent
fallwinter
beer
or
served
with
something
heavy
roast
beef
stew
or
irish
stew
i
can
drink
this
by
itself
but
probably
wouldnt
for
too
long
ky
summers
get
hot
and
sometimes
you
cant
drink
as
many
stoutsporters
as
i
would
like
d
notes
for
some
damn
reason
this
brew
cannot
be
sold
in
texas
as
i
had
to
purchase
it
in
missouri
while
visting
family
this
beer
is
so
good
it
would
nearly
be
worth
the
drive
to
get
more
okay
i
am
kidding
about
that
seriously
though
the
smootheness
of
this
brew
with
the
complex
flavors
is
awesome
best
of
all
nothing
is
overdone
or
meant
to
overwhelm
you
so
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
and
it
still
be
very
enjoyable
d
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
however
i
dont
like
to
drink
too
many
stouts
makes
me
feel
full
aside
from
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
drinkability
fair
i
could
see
putting
away
maybe
two
pints
of
this
but
probably
more
of
an
occasional
beer
still
a
pretty
nice
example
of
style
the
beer
is
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
room
temp
a
fluffy
creamy
tan
head
of
2
cm
foams
up
easily
and
fades
very
slowly
the
color
is
pitch
black
and
no
light
passes
through
aroma
is
roasted
malt
molasses
and
some
cocoa
no
real
hop
presence
on
the
nose
first
sip
reveals
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
liter
than
expected
body
with
slightly
thin
texture
flavor
is
all
malt
with
roasted
malt
some
coffee
bean
and
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
no
sweetness
that
i
would
expect
from
a
cream
stout
but
a
decent
beer
i
do
get
some
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
dont
expect
the
typical
sweetness
of
a
milk
stout
drinkability
i
dont
know
a
lot
about
milk
stouts
but
this
stuff
taste
pretty
good
d
i
really
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
not
terribly
heavy
but
the
combination
of
taste
and
mouth
feel
make
it
something
you
want
to
sip
on
without
being
really
complex
and
flavorful
enough
to
justify
how
slow
im
drinking
it
fairly
average
there
are
some
really
nice
flavors
here
nice
roasted
malt
presence
creating
some
nice
coffee
flavor
there
is
also
some
very
sweet
chocolate
flavor
in
there
caramel
is
present
in
the
background
and
some
fruity
hops
help
balance
out
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
but
is
a
touch
more
thin
and
carbonated
than
i
would
prefer
nice
drinkability
and
overall
a
solid
beer
its
a
good
mellow
stout
the
astringency
might
be
a
bit
much
but
overall
its
very
well
rounded
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
sweet
stout
style
best
before
july
2007
dark
chocolate
brown
nearly
black
with
a
mammoth
head
of
khaki
foam
soft
cocoa
aromas
like
maltomeal
with
slight
vanilla
and
coffee
notes
smells
promising
watereddown
chocolate
syrup
flavors
comingle
with
a
bit
of
malted
milk
ball
and
roasted
grain
coffee
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
thin
and
sloppy
with
nothing
very
interesting
going
on
actually
while
being
thin
it
simultaneously
seems
sticky
and
syrupy
but
in
a
nonsubstantial
way
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
faded
but
left
a
light
lacing
across
the
top
of
the
glass
a
roasted
malt
smell
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
delicious
taste
a
strong
roasted
flavor
once
it
hits
your
mouth
then
a
coffee
aftertaste
that
lingers
in
the
back
of
your
throat
with
the
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
the
aftertaste
is
the
proper
mix
of
sweet
and
bitterness
goes
down
creamy
and
has
the
right
touch
of
light
carbonation
a
nice
wet
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
very
drinkable
and
even
though
this
beer
fills
you
up
i
wanted
another
taste
is
like
a
sweetened
cappuccino
medium
mouth
feel
mild
cocoa
coffee
flavors
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
of
one
of
them
to
be
present
hops
are
mild
and
floral
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
flavors
sticking
around
too
i
think
im
tasting
an
oak
flavor
as
i
reach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
carbonation
is
medium
the
beer
has
a
dry
finish
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
dark
body
with
a
tan
head
slow
retention
typical
of
a
sam
adams
brew
that
reduces
into
a
nice
lacing
it
smelled
a
very
roasted
smell
with
chocolate
present
that
gave
it
a
very
grungy
feel
too
it
the
smell
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
nice
porter
it
tasted
a
toasted
chocolate
taste
the
chocolate
was
not
very
sweet
like
a
milk
chocolate
more
like
an
unfilitered
cocoa
taste
being
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
that
was
very
satidfying
very
smooth
going
down
a
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
overall
dont
look
to
pound
these
back
they
are
better
than
that
enjoy
one
while
you
are
just
hanging
out
or
looking
to
mellow
out
overall
a
good
brew
d
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
with
its
strong
flavors
and
sweet
undertones
this
beer
pairs
nicely
with
dessert
dark
chocolate
or
cheese
plateor
have
it
in
lieu
of
dessert
best
sipped
and
savored
itd
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
2

a
sitting

a
little
burnt

this
faded

leaving

fruit
and
chocolate
character
roasted
dry
finish
medium
body

carbonation
sort
of
creamy
pretty
good

it
all

glad
its
brewed
year
round
because
i
could
drink
it
year
round
for
sure
a
nice
offering
from
sa
i
was
surprised
by
the
full
flavor
of
this
stout
i
expected
something
much
more
sweet
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
balanced
and
creamy
very
drinkable
nice
session
stout
d
far
more
drinkable
than
many
sweet
stouts
because
of
the
thin
mouthfeel
i
think
ill
have
another
this
is
a
heavy
beer
limiting
its
drinkability
but
a
good
after
dinner
drink
d
very
good
not
too
heavy
or
syrupy
very
good
entry
level
stout
sessionable
for
those
that
like
stouts
d
overall
quite
nice
would
get
it
again

yet
not
too
heavy
served
slightly
chilled
in

about
a

a
half
of

thick
offwhite
head
head
dissapeared
quickly
into
a
bubbly
blob
in
the
center
of
the
glass
smelled
faintly
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
tiny
hints
of
vanilla
tasted
of
chocolate
faintly
of
burnt
coffee
and
some
charcoal
notes
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
almost
watery
drinkability
was
average
seems
like
a
beer
that
could
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
not
great
but
not
bad
could
drink
this
again
d
a
very
wellcrafter
beer
i
am
very
happy
with
it
i
will
add
it
to
my
rotation
a
good
beginners
stout
cheers
dcrafted
with
attention
to
detail
and
a
real
joy
to
drink
i
think
it
is
the
best
tasting

appearance
dark
liquid

big

smell
of
chocolate
and
malt
taste
of
cofee
and
cocoa
light
mouthfeel
and
smoothness
like
a
guiness
not
very
carbonic
so
no
serious
bite
or
tingle
just
smoooth
in
and
down
signature
well
balanced
sam
adams
beer
notes
decent
all
around
taste
is
much
more
appealing
than
the
smell
either
way
its
worth
a
try
and
a
decent
session
beer
to
boot
i
would
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
but
as
my
first
cream
stout
im
more
interested
in
exploring
what
else
the
style
has
to
offer
as
i
was
not
overwhelmed
probably
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
the
boston
beer
co
and
i
really
wish
more
local
places
would
carry
it
as
it
would
probably
have
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
a
great
offering
that
shouldnt
be
missed
mouthfeel
is
sessionable
and
heavy
but
not
syrupy
well
done
drinkability
a
good
sipper
not
one
ill
stock
but
will
reccomend
to
friends
and
enjoy
if
offered
i
was
ecpecting
more
of
a
stout
but
this
is
good
in
its
own
right
deep
brownbordering
on
black
in
color
nice
tan
head
on
top
some
great
lacing
as
it
goes
down
very
nice
nutty
and
roasted
aromas
greatsomewhat
mellow
roasted
flavor
hint
of
nuttiness
and
a
slight
trace
of
sweetness
the
aroma
and
flavor
really
meld
together
for
a
singular
experience
velvety
creamy
mouthfeel
despite
the
roasted
flavor
extremely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
havnt
had
this
in
years
damn
nice
to
have
again
excellent
brew
from
sam
adams
i
was
very
impressed
but
maybe
not
surprised
that
they
use
a
different
yeast
strain
than
their
usual
brews
i
wish
this
beer
was
as
widely
available
as
guinness
it
is
dark
and
frothy
darker
head
than
guinness
but
very
acceptable
for
the
style
it
has
a
nice
roasty
smell
and
taste
that
complements
it
as
well
i
think
it
is
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
for
the
style
i
cannot
immediately
distinguish
the
hops
but
i
can
taste
the
bitterness
that
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
may
be
better
if
infused
with
nitrogen
no
alcoholic
or
estery
flavors
at
all
so
it
is
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
any
one
who
doesnt
like
guinness
because
this
is
more
to
style
for
a
stout
and
is
not
sour
one
bit
then
again
it
is
a
sweet
stout
style
instead
of
regular
stout
i
always
am
pleased
with
anything
from
boston
brewing
company
and
this
just
confirms
it
again
cheers
drinkability
first
time
with
a
cream
stout
and
i
must
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
can
not
wait
to
try
others
this
beer
pours
into
a
pint
glass
looking
like
it
smells
like
fresh
brewed
espresso
hints
of
chocolate
occasionally
break
through
the
nose
as
well
this
beer
is
referred
to
as
the
cappuccino
of
beers
on
the
samuel
adams
website
and
i
cant
improve
on
that
the
taste
of
mild
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
travel
throughout
from
start
to
finish
hints
of
warm
caramel
also
ribbon
through
this
roasted
malty
offering
the
creamy
mouth
feel
and
finish
add
to
the
drinkability
and
appeal
of
this
stout
pairs
great
with
hearty
chili
especially
as
an
ingredient
beef
stew
or
steak
i
have
however
consumed
a
few
for
dessert
enjoy
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
sly
fox
pint
glass
appears
a
nice
dark
deep
shade
of
brown
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
thick
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
coffee
mild
grains
and
sweet
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
cappuccino
smooth
and
velvety
with
a
medium
body
im
glad
this
is
fairly
easy
to
find
as
i
can
always
count
on
this
beer
to
satisfy
kinda
frustrating
to
review
these
s
a
brews
the
flavors
are
good
but
leave
me
megging
for
more
richness
boldness
and
flavor
sure
the
brew
is
solid
and
probable
fit
the
style
well
however
in
this
one
i
wanted
a
heavier
cream
character
a
bolder
richer
milk
chocolate
capuccino
flavor
and
a
bit
more
overall
weight
what
i
got
was
a
cleanly
brewed
well
formed
recipe
that
is
not
offensive
yet
risks
little
though
timid
for
my
taste
i
thought
the
brew
fell
dangerously
close
to
a
drystout
chalkiness
and
with
a
thin
body
fortunately
but
beer
steers
clear
of
obvious
lactose
additions
and
artificial
sweetness
this
s
a
brew
does
very
well
i
just
wanted
more
out
of
it
poured
into
a
guinness
glass
from
a
bottle
nice
vigorous
dark
tan
head
above
a
pitch
black
liquid
roasted
malts
sweet
caramel
and
char
very
rich
and
smooth
and
it
leaves
a
nice
burnt
taste
in
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
bold
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
as
it
warms
up
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
plus
sam
adams
always
maintains
a
reasonable
price
6
99
for
a
6er
pours
black
thin
tan
head
not
much
retention
but
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
malts
smell
was
on
the
weak
side
body
was
thin
with
some
carbionation
and
somewhat
watery
taste
is
like
the
smell
with
a
dry
finish
more
like
a
weak
dry
irish
stout
than
a
milk
stout
low
abv
so
drink
it
all
night
but
why
majestic
black
with
a
great
coffee
head
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
burnt
toast
thick
and
chewy
coffee
flavors
everywhere
some
nutty
goodness
hazelnut
pretty
good
goes
down
smooth
i
recommend
trying
it
a
very
good
stout
for
the
price
and
another
good
product
from
sam
adams
an
easy
drinking
rounded
edges
stout
maybe
a
bit
undersweet
for
the
style
but
thats
not
a
complaint
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
beer
poured
well
with
a
nice
head
that
unfortunately
dissipated
too
quickly
and
the
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
instantly
made
my
mouth
water
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
redundant
of
the
scent
but
slightly
dulled
while
the
carbonation
was
definitely
present
it
was
not
overbearing
and
it
finished
softly
and
somewhat
dry
it
might
not
be
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
it
gets
an
e
for
effort
at
the
least
the
aroma
promises
more
than
the
flavor
delivers
but
the
end
result
is
a
decently
drinkable
earthy
stout
though
it
might
not
provoke
a
host
of
fond
memories
so
its
enjoyable
just
not
notable
could
be
worse
im
sure
drinkability
i
think
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
because
they
arent
too
heavy
or
syrupy
but
im
not
sure
sweet
stouts
are
my
thing
this
is
basically
a
lighter
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
but
i
think
i
would
rather
take
a
mackeson
over
either
d
for
what
is
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
a
good
drinker
however
not
even
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorites
samuel
adams
cream
stout
was
black
in
color
with
a
hint
of
ruby
when
held
to
a
light
the
tan
head
was
thick
rocky
and
had
good
retention
leaving
rings
of
lace
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
sweet
dark
malt
and
roasty
the
taste
was
dark
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
finish
was
dry
and
quite
nice
the
body
was
medium
sort
of
creamy
and
the
carbonation
was
about
medium
drinkability
was
good
overall
this
a
good
stout
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
d
clean
finish
and
highly
drinkable
really
stands
up
well
with
others
stouts
like
rogue
shakespeare
etc
with
the
low
abv
on
this
one
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
night
is
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
bottom
line
a
very
tasty
sample
of
the
style
that
i
can
easily
recommend
this
is
a
great
beer
for
just
about
any
time
especially
for
sessioning
highly
recommended
two
scoops
of
french
vanilla
ice
cream
in
addition
would
satisfy
d
very
drinkable
rich
and
full
so
probably
cant
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
the
most
without
feeling
full
but
would
otherwise
love
to
just
sip
on
one
of
these
all
evening
d
i
dont
mind
this
cream
stout
actually
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
quite
drinkable
and
smooth
drinkability
was
good
by
default
watery
beers
with
weak
flavors
are
usually
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
lacks
the
warming
characteristic
found
in
other
beers
of
the
style
its
ok
but
not
great
notes
not
much
to
critique
here
pretty
straight
forward
with
nothing
offensive
probably
the
best
cream
stout
ive
had
to
date
this
brew
is
fairly
meaty
for
such
a
low
abv
amazing
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
stout
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
and
bitter
balance
that
leaves
a
lingering
coffee
aftertaste
i
would
try
this
one
again
drinkability
is
great
for
such
a
thick
and
creamy
beer
the
abv
obviously
helps
this
beer
is
just
so
tasty
and
aromatic
that
its
hard
not
to
drink
bravo
samuel
adams
you
definitely
have
a
winner
on
this
one
even
my
girlfriend
likes
this
beer
i
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
and
dark
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
the
head
though
that
might
be
due
to
the
detergent
on
my
glass
nice
and
sweet
caramel
flavor
chased
by
a
toasted
barley
feel
very
nice
and
drinkable
solid
mouthfeel
i
will
buy
this
again
picked
some
of
this
stuff
up
the
other
day
finally
and
i
was
very
impressed
i
even
took
a
picture
after
i
poured
it
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
say
the
least
it
poured
a
nice
black
that
you
could
barely
see
through
and
an
amazing
head
that
stuck
around
smelled
like
caramel
and
roasted
malts
it
had
a
sweet
creamy
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
goes
down
great
this
has
become
one
of
my
new
favorite
stouts
give
it
a
shot
if
you
havent
already
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
thick
persistent
head
that
had
a
nice
little
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
bitter
and
has
a
slightly
burnt
odor
the
taste
is
bitter
and
smooth
with
a
coffee
type
overtone
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
kind
of
chewy
and
creamy
this
is
a
great
beer
that
id
consider
very
drinkable
but
it
might
be
a
little
rich
for
several
in
a
row
drinkability
the
easiest
to
down
stout
ive
ever
had
the
best
of
sam
adams
a
worthwhile
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
samual
adams
brewery
additionally
since
it
has
the
name
appeal
this
would
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
people
interested
in
exploring
more
fullbodied
complex
drinks
recommended
d
really
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
you
can
beat
it
at
sam
adams
prices
an
awesome
brew
from
sam
adams
poured
a
thick
black
with
a
halfinch
of
head
good
lacing
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
nuts
and
florals
too
very
sweet
which
is
a
little
odd
but
makes
it
surpringly
drinkable
for
a
stout
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
one
but
i
will
be
buying
it
again
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
boldly
bitter
finish
but
doesnt
make
you
queasy
after
three
or
four
so
drinkability
is
high
unfortunately
with
beers
this
bold
its
difficult
to
make
a
session
out
of
them
and
still
have
any
real
appreciation
for
its
character
but
definitely
more
drinkable
than
most
sweet
stouts
altogether
highly
recommended
and
with
a
pretty
reasonable
price
tag
as
well
enjoy
folks
its
well
worth
it
da
nice
with
food
nice
for
dessert
da
highly
drinkable
sammy
right
here
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
as
a
cream
stout
this
sits
fairly
heavily
in
the
stomach
but
is
still
incredibly
drinkable
has
the
nice
smooth
quality
of
a
great
cream
stout
a
worthy
member
of
the
sam
adams
brewmasters
collection
drinkability
is
great
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
session
stout
the
smell
is
misleading
i
was
expecting
and
overly
sweet
stout
but
was
presently
surprised
by
the
balance
of
flavors
cheers
d
this
is
pretty
good
id
have
another
but
i
only
bought
one
bottle
id
definitely
buy
this
again
dark
rusty
maroon
and
a
great
ochre
head
take
your
time
looking
at
this
beer
because
its
much
better
as
it
warms
with
the
sweet
roasted
character
really
coming
out
near
the
end
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
milk
a
pretty
simple
blend
but
it
works
sweetness
hits
first
but
its
quickly
balanced
out
by
a
little
bitterness
ending
on
a
mild
but
welcome
hop
note
in
the
aftertaste
smells
a
little
flat
and
sournothing
like
the
taste
but
for
a
cream
stout
its
surprisingly
thin
making
it
far
more
drinkable
even
if
it
doesnt
really
suit
the
style
or
the
flavors
very
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
deep
dark
brown
like
a
walnut
from
the
deepest
darkest
woods
huge
tan
head
settles
to
an
18
of
an
inch
and
lasts
for
most
of
the
duration
sweet
dark
toffee
and
loads
of
it
in
the
aroma
ice
cream
chocolate
peanut
brittle
and
honey
it
is
a
truly
wonderful
aroma
carbonation
is
blistering
body
is
medium
with
mild
chocolate
bitterness
taste
is
sweet
espresso
bakers
chocolate
caramel
and
a
mild
burntness
mild
lactic
qualities
all
the
elements
are
here
and
it
drinks
fairly
well
but
for
reasons
i
just
cant
explain
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
had
the
s
a
cream
stout
pours
nicely
into
a
glass
i
love
the
dark
beers
and
their
off
white
heads
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
head
like
roasted
coffee
with
some
dark
bitter
chocolate
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
or
hops
here
the
body
leans
more
heavily
towards
the
chocolate
end
of
things
although
there
is
some
nice
spice
and
a
mollasses
like
flavor
the
hops
do
show
up
a
bit
but
in
a
supporting
role
only
although
i
do
enjoy
the
beer
i
feel
a
cream
style
beer
should
have
tighter
carbonation
and
a
smoother
mouthfeel
this
finishes
fairly
strong
but
not
overwhelming
you
can
put
a
few
of
these
down
before
it
becomes
too
much
to
handle
back
in
the
mid
90s
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
it
still
is
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
it
is
not
a
ghost
of
its
former
self
still
rich
and
satisfying
i
would
be
happy
to
spend
a
night
sipping
a
few
pints
of
this
brew
dthis
being
my
first
stout
i
thought
it
was
nicely
balanced
the
fairly
full
body
made
for
an
interesting
brew
very
dark
pour
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
of
coffee
and
caramel
leading
to
a
taste
of
a
pleasant
nutty
coffee
sweeter
and
smoother
than
many
stouts
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
typical
for
a
stout
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
probably
not
drink
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
d
this
beer
has
nice
depth
of
malt
and
a
good
fragrant
beer
at
that
it
has
some
nice
creaminess
in
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
it
is
note
a
really
big
beer
so
it
will
make
a
pleasant
session
beer
dvery
drinkable
dark
beer
smooth
and
finishes
clean
which
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
would
recommend
highly
sam
adams
comes
through
once
again
thanks
jim
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
the
stuff
poured
one
of
them
in
a
pint
glass
and
right
away
could
smell
the
chocolate
and
coffee
very
good
smell
the
head
on
it
was
like
chocolate
ice
cream
colored
and
stayed
long
enough
the
color
was
very
dark
and
could
see
the
carbonation
the
taste
was
definetly
not
as
good
as
the
smell
but
it
was
still
quite
good
it
had
a
full
mouthfeel
you
definetly
could
tell
you
were
drinking
a
stout
overall
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
as
it
was
a
very
good
beer
d
while
this
isnt
the
strongest
stout
it
is
still
good
and
something
i
can
see
myself
getting
again
a
good
beer
to
initiate
someone
into
the
wonderful
world
of
stouts
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
dosnt
pack
too
much
flavor
a
really
enjoyable
stout
with
flavors
that
arent
too
intense
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
last
bottle
of
a
six
pack
pours
cola
black
with
decent
sized
head
which
after
a
minute
or
so
turns
into
a
ring
with
lacing
all
over
abundance
of
carbonation
bubbles
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
taste
is
just
like
smell
with
some
hints
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
creamy
while
somehow
managing
to
be
on
the
light
side
nice
dry
bittering
but
not
overly
so
finish
putting
away
a
few
of
these
would
be
no
problem
solid
brew
drinkability
is
above
average
but
again
thinness
and
overall
muted
tones
make
this
ok
not
great
but
definitely
drinkable
this
stout
left
lots
of
lacing
down
my
glass
and
really
had
a
nice
head
on
the
pour
one
thing
sam
adams
has
going
for
them
is
theyre
beers
look
really
good
and
smell
good
the
head
on
this
beer
never
goes
anywhere
has
a
full
rich
mouthfeel
youd
think
with
all
the
flavor
it
would
have
a
higher
abv
but
is
a
nice
session
beer
had
a
nice
bitterness
touch
which
lingered
a
bit
that
being
said
this
beer
is
fairly
complex
very
opaque
color
with
toffee
caramel
and
coffee
ringing
through
on
the
smell
and
taste
for
that
matter
this
stout
is
as
good
as
any
you
will
find
pours
into
a
pint
glass
black
in
color
with
a
whispy
lace
on
the
top
not
much
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
of
coffee
with
a
lot
of
creamer
sweet
but
not
overly
so
mild
oder
of
smoke
taste
is
very
coffee
like
with
some
rich
dark
chocolate
nice
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
to
balance
the
sweetness
taste
very
good
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
dry
finish
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
should
always
be
in
the
fridge
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
low
abv
makes
this
an
excellent
session
beer
big
beer
taste
without
the
big
beer
alcohol
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
the
taste
contains
hints
of
oatmeal
and
there
is
a
bitterness
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
there
is
a
lasting
aftertaste
that
is
a
nice
finish
i
could
drink
this
beer
more
often
a
nice
example
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
chocoloate
and
coffee
color
nice
two
finger
tan
cap
that
dissipated
to
a
14
inch
cap
leaving
nice
sticky
lacings
up
sides
aroma
is
coffee
caramel
molasses
chocolate
orange
and
fusal
hops
and
very
light
esters
in
undertones
flavor
is
sticky
sweet
caramel
chocolate
and
lots
of
coffee
so
much
coffee
i
almost
think
theres
added
coffee
a
little
fusal
hop
bitterness
but
is
overwheled
by
the
coffee
astringency
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
medium
body
and
watery
finish
drinkability
doesnt
go
down
very
easy
because
of
the
bitter
dry
quality
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
doesnt
make
it
any
easier
even
though
it
probably
should
overall
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
very
drinkable
and
at
6
50
for
a
sixer
an
amazing
value
i
should
have
gotten
some
more
boston
lager
this
isnt
really
creamy
at
all
just
a
slightly
above
average
american
stout
is
the
world
of
dark
beers
limited
to
the
irish
dry
stout
what
a
tossup
this
beer
on
the
one
hand
it
looks
terrific
with
a
huge
rocky
head
have
to
watch
how
fast
you
pour
it
and
a
pitch
black
stout
color
it
smells
like
a
unique
blend
of
roasted
malts
which
is
what
one
expects
from
a
sweet
stout
mouthfeel
is
good
with
decent
carbonation
and
smoothness
the
flavor
though
it
starts
with
a
sweet
palecaramel
malt
flavor
but
is
almost
instantly
obliterated
by
harsh
astringent
charcoal
every
sip
is
like
that
starts
sweet
turns
charred
the
aftertaste
is
all
charcoal
too
dry
is
one
thing
i
can
drink
guinness
and
i
dont
mind
the
sour
dryness
but
this
charcoal
astringency
is
too
much
this
was
one
of
the
first
stouts
i
tried
over
a
year
ago
and
in
retrospect
i
cant
remember
why
i
didnt
hate
it
then
maybe
i
just
didnt
know
any
better
this
poured
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
huge
foamy
tan
head
which
lingered
for
several
minutes
about
the
glass
and
left
incredible
lacing
very
impressive
the
aroma
was
a
typical
stout
malty
with
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
hints
the
taste
was
very
smooth
with
cream
sweet
malts
caramel
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
more
watery
than
i
would
have
liked
but
it
was
still
creamier
than
it
was
bitter
relatively
wellbalanced
great
sipping
beer
samuel
adams
scores
again
i
was
cooking
eggs
and
sage
sausage
for
breakfast
and
realized
i
was
too
lazy
to
make
coffee
hey
its
hard
work
so
i
decided
to
open
one
of
these
that
i
just
got
yesterday
and
have
it
with
breakfast
it
does
say
the
cappuccino
of
beers
afterall
the
eggs
and
sausage
were
forgettable
the
cream
stout
was
awesome
i
was
impressed
by
the
bulky
demonstrative
head
that
stuck
around
and
even
now
as
my
glass
is
almost
emptyleaves
a
heavy
lacing
and
crown
smells
lovelyvery
appetizing
creamy
smell
as
i
would
expect
from
a
good
rep
of
this
style
and
the
taste
is
very
enjoyableextremely
smooth
and
mild
creamy
and
sweet
just
what
i
was
looking
for
who
needs
coffee
i
admit
i
take
mine
with
cream
and
sugar
and
this
sweet
creamy
brew
was
a
perfect
replacement
this
cream
stout
should
be
americas
breakfast
drink
of
choice
a
well
balanced
complex
cream
stout
yet
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sweet
a
great
dessert
choice
or
to
have
on
its
own
d
i
think
this
is
the
best
sam
adams
ive
had
yet
this
will
be
my
goto
stout
from
now
on
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
samuel
adams
cream
stout
pours
a
dark
not
quite
black
color
with
plenty
of
ruby
highlights
to
be
seen
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
ok
mostly
roasted
malt
no
real
coffee
or
chocolate
notes
stand
out
always
a
dissapointment
to
me
if
drinking
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
creamy
seems
like
a
good
beginner
stout
to
me
but
for
serious
stout
drinkers
id
look
elsewhere
pours
pitch
black
with
mahogany
highlights
the
color
is
almost
totally
opaque
but
becomes
extra
clear
when
held
in
front
of
a
bright
light
creamy
biege
head
of
one
and
a
half
fingers
shows
decent
retention
and
an
abundance
of
spotty
lacing
strong
coffee
aroma
with
charred
chocolate
malt
and
background
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
dextrinous
sweet
upon
first
sip
then
some
roasted
notes
mingle
in
and
then
the
flaovr
is
wonderfully
balanced
by
a
mellow
coffee
chocolate
malt
and
barely
perceivable
fuggles
hops
semidry
in
the
aftertaste
the
medium
carbonation
is
enough
to
match
the
rich
dextrinous
mouthfeel
a
touch
crisp
ut
good
texture
there
is
some
excess
residual
sugar
in
the
finish
but
its
dry
enough
to
retain
a
high
drinkability
a
great
example
of
style
with
superb
balance
d
to
much
of
a
burned
flavor
on
this
offering
i
honestly
expected
a
milk
stout
to
be
sweeter
or
at
least
less
burned
or
bitter
mouthfeel
moderate
creamy
only
lightly
carbonated
tastes
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
with
sweet
and
bitter
sooo
nicely
balanced
leaving
a
dry
cocoa
powder
on
the
finish
it
is
easy
to
savor
or
to
gulp
down
satisfying
brew
dark
brown
body
over
a
good
size
tan
head
that
doesnt
quit
even
after
vigorous
swirling
the
smell
is
a
bit
musky
but
toasty
coffeeish
malt
undertones
are
present
a
very
mature
taste
the
malt
and
creamy
flavors
are
forward
and
quite
pleasant
there
is
a
bit
of
an
offness
at
the
finish
like
instant
coffee
but
it
doesnt
really
hurt
the
overall
effect
d
i
suggest
this
brew
to
any
dark
beer
fan
they
are
harder
to
find
than
the
boston
lager
but
worth
it
it
took
me
awhile
to
get
this
beer
because
the
first
time
i
did
try
to
buy
it
someone
stole
it
from
my
shopping
cart
when
i
was
not
looking
i
happened
to
have
the
last
6
pack
in
the
store
but
they
had
plenty
when
i
went
back
a
couple
weeks
later
another
good
brew
from
sam
the
mouth
is
pretty
smooth
but
it
may
be
a
touch
over
carbonated
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sa
beers
im
hoping
it
gets
wide
spread
distribution
and
has
some
success
as
i
would
hate
to
see
this
one
disappear
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
complaint
about
the
drinkability
at
all
mfd
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
kinda
thick
and
creamy
but
not
too
syupy
at
all
fairly
light
in
weight
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
do
2
or
3
of
these
cheers
the
beer
pours
dark
really
really
dark
i
put
this
beer
near
a
light
and
could
not
see
the
light
at
all
through
the
beer
that
was
one
good
sign
to
me
the
head
of
the
beer
was
a
creamy
brown
and
very
frothy
like
a
stout
should
be
no
real
smell
at
all
though
distinct
coffee
roasted
malt
flavor
on
the
mouthful
very
soft
milky
beer
excellent
flavor
this
beer
is
one
of
my
oldest
beer
memories
getting
one
of
my
first
mix
packs
and
diving
into
a
world
that
would
soon
consume
my
life
by
far
my
favorite
beer
in
the
old
mixpacks
2000
i
suppose
it
pours
out
a
black
beer
with
ruby
edges
in
the
light
the
head
is
light
tan
with
a
good
froth
staying
afloat
throughout
and
beautiful
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
it
has
a
fruity
apple
peel
smell
with
a
good
hint
of
roasted
malts
the
beer
is
a
little
more
watery
than
id
like
but
it
still
has
a
delicious
roasted
coffee
like
malt
with
a
nice
sweetness
to
balance
it
just
enough
hops
in
the
beer
so
that
i
notice
them
but
not
to
overpower
anything
in
fact
the
hops
are
more
of
an
afterthought
that
they
were
there
while
drinking
mouthfeel
is
unimpressive
a
little
to
light
and
clean
just
not
what
i
expect
from
the
style
oh
the
memories
and
it
is
fine
to
drink
just
cant
live
up
to
the
amazing
flavor
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
it
in
a
time
when
my
towns
selection
included
only
sam
adams
saranac
mackesons
and
weihenstephaner
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
really
like
it
although
it
doesnt
have
all
the
extreme
characteristics
of
some
other
styles
imho
thats
what
makes
this
beer
so
appealing
i
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
this
is
a
great
offering
from
sam
adams
boston
beer
adds
its
15th
beer
to
my
list
they
keep
coming
at
me
with
viable
choices
d
i
have
had
this
before
albeit
a
very
long
time
ago
and
to
be
honest
my
opinions
then
werent
very
good
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
shot
because
this
is
actually
quite
good
probably
one
of
the
better
regular
offerings
from
sam
adams
that
is
regularly
available
i
enjoyed
having
one
very
much
but
i
was
thinking
if
i
was
going
to
have
another
beer
i
would
probably
have
something
else
poured
from
a
12oz

comprised
of
chocolatecaramel

flavors
starting
sweet
and

bitter
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
smooth
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
incredible
smell
of
this
stout
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
feels
slick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
as
it
coats
the
mouth

lacks
some
complexity
simpler
than
it
seems
it
should
be
still
a
very
good
beer
would
seek
out
again
drinkability

just
a
good
staple
stout
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
what
more
do
you
need
drinkability
the
first
few
sips
are
the
best
and
it
wears
on
you
a
bit
after
would
buy
again
but
no
more
than
a
6
pack
very
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
tangy
aftertaste
a
very
upfront
simple
beer
without
a
lot
of
subtle
flavours
but
extremely
drinkable
and
a
nice
surprise
for
me
as
most
of
the
sam
adams
experiences
ive
had
have
been
better
than
macro
but
nothing
fantastic
verdict
it
looks
great
and
the
aroma
is
complex
and
alluring
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
promise
though
its
a
finetasting
beer
sweet
and
roasty
but
its
not
exceptionally
rich
note
i
prefer
this
a
bit
cooler
as
it
gets
too
sweet
as
it
warms
for
a
bitter
beer
this
has
very
good
drinkability
id
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
if
stout
is
your
thing
and
the
sweetness
doesnt
turn
you
off

is
another
amazing
beer

the

aroma
is

reminds
me
of
mashing
in
time
at
a
brewery
thats
what
the
aroma
is
taste
is
nice
slight
twang
that
i
chalk
up
to
the
cream
stout
style

could
use
some
work
a
thicker
beer
would
be
nice
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
and
all
a
quite
good
stout
just
the
right
mix
of
sweet
and
hop
and
coffee
to
make
me
want
more
well
worth

try

smooth

day
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
rather
easily
to
me
it
tastes
almost
identical
to
anchor
porter
for
some
reason
very
good
as
a
session
beer
this
seems
to
be
a
lot
less
filling
than
guinness
or
other
dry
irish
stouts
if
you
dig
the
taste
you
could
easily
knock
down
a
few
of
these
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
as
ive
come
to
expect
exceptional
things
from
the
bbc
as
stouts
go
i
prefer
guinness
extra
and
mackesons
but
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
stout
i
cannot
figure
out
why
there
are
haters
of
this
brewery
on
this
site
i
love
everything
i
have
tried
by
bbc
have
not
tried
the
cherry
wheat
or
cranberry
lambic
the
two
most
maligned
beers
by
this
brewery
as
far
as
im
concereced
bbc
is
the
best
widely
available
brewery
out
there
this
brew
pours
a
black
color
the
head
is
huge
and
marvelous
in
color
light
tan
with
white
speckles
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
it
is
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
other
stouts
i
have
had
but
it
works
well
for
this
beer
in
fact
i
think
it
cuts
through
some
of
the
thickness
and
makes
this
more
of
a
session
stout
overall
this
is
hands
down
samuel
adams
best
year
round
offering
and
a
solid
standby
thoughts
i
am
not
afraid
to
say
that
there
are
some
sa
brews
that
i
really
like
to
me
theres
a
thin
line
between
micro
and
macro
sams
lager
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
stable
beers
around
i
also
love
the
old
fezziwig
with
the
cream
stout
i
will
add
another
to
the
list
macro
or
micro
this
is
a
great
beer
a
winner
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
wish
it
were
eaiser
to
find
poured
out
to
a
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
mocha
cream
head
that
ended
up
being
little
more
than
a
blanket
for
the
top
of
the
beer
lower
carbonation
nice
thick
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
aromas
of
cocoa
coffee
and
dairy
were
light
but
inviting
taste
was
darn
good
flavors
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
mild
dark
pepper
and
grain
permeated
the
palate
nice
mouthfeel
was
full
and
rich
a
good
level
of
drinkability
what
else
can
i
say
samuel
adams
kicks
out
good
beers
period
recommended
special
thanks
to
battlekow
for
the
sample
drinkability
with
the
low
abv
this
is
highly
slammable
i
see
it
as
more
of
a
go
to
beer
for
stout
lovers
nothing
exciting
but
nothing
offensive
either
pours
up
with
a
two
finger
head
that
stays
with
the
beer
a
lighter
head
with
more
of
a
brownish
tint
than
some
other
stouts
the
smell
is
of
mocha
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
full
burnt
and
smoky
with
a
nice
coffeesweet
creamy
finish
creamy
on
the
cheek
and
tongue
from
the
word
go
very
nice
on
the
way
down
fun
to
drink
i
will
buy
this
one
again
i
really
like
the
fact
that
sa
can
make
quality
beers
and
distribute
them
nationwide
at
affordable
prices
props
to
sa
drinkability
one
of
these
makes
a
fine
dessert
two
would
make
a
fine
meal
any
more
than
that
and
you
might
have
problems
but
thats
good
because
stouts
arent
supposed
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
you
drink
by
the
case
therefore
no
docking
of
points
in
this
category
drinkability
is
all
right
this
is
my
first
cream
stout
and
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
the
creaminess
but
i
will
try
another
one
to
compare
to
considering
what
i
find
to
be
a
pronounced
hop
finish
im
not
sure
i
would
serve
this
with
anything
chocolate
it
might
cause
the
chocolate
to
appear
bitter
on
the
other
hand
a
good
sweet
milk
chocolate
might
help
to
mellow
the
hoppiness
on
the
finish
pours
black
with
large
brown
head
i
definitely
taste
chocolate
but
not
over
sweet
along
with
that
i
taste
caramel
roasted
coffee
its
all
pleasent
to
the
taste
buds
for
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
amazing
i
will
revisit
the
beer
again
and
agian
overall
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
largely
due
to
the
unpleasant
aftertaste
on
this
one
this
was
the
first
milksweet
stout
i
ever
tried
and
led
me
to
try
various
others
of
the
style
that
i
liked
better
but
as
a
whole
its
not
nearly
up
to
the
standards
of
mackeson
xxx
or
rogue
chocolate
stout
its
a
great
intro
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
the
style
though
and
i
suspect
that
plenty
of
newbies
who
think
guinness
is
too
bitter
might
find
themselves
very
happy
with
this
the
mouthfeel
here
really
complemented
the
flavor
and
added
to
the
drinkability
of
the
brew
there
was
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
perhaps
a
very
even
feel
of
a
well
carbonated
commercial
product
that
may
be
the
only
drawback
but
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
again
i
would
certainly
consider
this
at
least
as
good
if
not
better
than
guinness
in
my
opinion
as
the
beer
flowed
from
the
bottle
it
created
a
beautiful
dark
almost
black
pool
im
glass
that
was
topped
with
a
delightful
tan
head
that
had
true
staying
power
smell
is
an
intoxicating
mixture
of
chocolate
coffee
caramel
plums
prunes
raisins
and
figs
taste
is
superb
with
just
the
right
combination
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
fruit
finishes
with
a
magnificent
dryness
to
create
a
perfect
ending
as
you
may
guess
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
black
but
not
completely
with
ruby
highlights
big
tan
head
excellent
lacing
smells
like
coffee
with
cream
and
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
bitter
coffee
and
lactose
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
lacking
kinda
watery
but
the
carbonation
gave
it
a
nice
smoothness
im
glad
i
was
able
to
save
a
bottle
of
thisthanks
go
out
to
the
girls
for
hating
it
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
with
a
beautiful
2
finger
creamy
head
that
lasted
the
entire
beer
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
woody
vanilla
and
barley
malts
taste
is
woody
roasted
coffee
with
vanilla
and
dark
cherry
notes
and
maybe
a
little
milk
chocolate
rather
sweet
overall
could
maybe
use
some
more
balancing
hops
but
i
dont
mind
a
sweet
beer
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
fullbodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
could
drink
about
2
of
these
and
the
fulness
would
set
in
i
tasty
cream
stout
here
for
sure
and
a
bargain
at
5
99sixer
definitely
worth
a
go
my
first
cream
stout
and
i
think
that
it
is
excellent
keep
up
the
great
work
boston
beer
company
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
anytime
of
the
year
drinkability
is
not
bad
this
is
a
good
slow
sipping
brew
to
enjoy
with
some
chocolate
cake
or
a
rich
cigar
another
winner
in
the
sam
adams
family
of
brews
overall
i
dont
have
a
craving
for
stouts
too
often
but
when
i
do
i
would
consider
buying
this
again
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
offering
drinkability
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
one
sessionable
i
can
usually
find
sam
adams
for
5
49
to
5
99
somewhere
and
i
will
definitely
have
to
get
this
one
again
i
recommend
it
my
new
choice
as
best
beer
in
the
sam
adams
family
of
beers
very
well
brewed
not
as
complex
as
kalamazoo
stout
but
certainly
surprizing
for
a
high
volumn
brewer
dated
nov
05
pours
a
very
dark
blackbrown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
leaves
a
nice
trace
of
lacing
scents
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
i
do
like
this
better
than
a
guiness
but
i
guess
stouts
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
medium
body
and
i
could
drink
two
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
is
good
even
with
the
carbonation
and
is
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
last
year
overall
enjoyable
offering
from
a
brewery
that
can
stagger
off
the
path
once
in
a
while
with
overpriced
and
overhyped
brews
as
well
as
rather
staid
boring
underachievers
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
their
better
brews
me
thinx
but
im
no
brewer
and
an
english
patriot
so
i
guess
my
thoughts
dont
count
for
much
here
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
no
problems
with
recommending
that
you
pick
up
a
6pack
of
these
serviceable
stout
the
gimmick
is
the
load
of
cream
in
the
head
the
taste
of
the
body
was
nonobjectionable
passable
stout
drinkable
drying
with
some
coffee
grinds
burnst
grounds
not
much
roastiness
much
malt
bit
of
graininess
well
carbonated
this
cream
stout
comes
from
the
samuel
adams
brewmasters
collection
and
a
lovely
addition
it
is
lactose
chocolate
and
caramel
up
front
then
it
moves
on
to
a
more
milk
chocolate
taste
with
the
hops
coming
through
at
the
same
time
these
flavors
linger
for
quite
some
time
in
the
finish
this
beer
pours
black
with
very
little
light
shining
through
the
head
is
brown
it
fades
slowly
leaving
very
thick
laces
it
smells
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
also
slight
hints
of
coffee
there
is
a
very
subtle
hop
aroma
also
it
tastes
strongly
of
milk
chocolate
it
has
a
very
slight
taste
of
coffee
also
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
but
it
is
still
good
this
beer
is
very
creamy
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
it
is
carbonated
very
nicely
it
leaves
a
coffee
taste
on
the
palate
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
because
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
it
is
mild
this
is
not
the
best
cream
stout
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
still
quite
good
if
you
happen
to
see
this
one
you
should
give
it
a
try
it
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
boston
beer
companys
better
beers
tastes
wonderful
with
a
noticable
hop
bitterness
once
you
get
past
the
hops
the
malt
taste
pokes
through
and
reflects
the
smells
medium
carbonation
makes
this
feel
great
in
my
mouth
this
is
one
i
like
to
keep
on
hand
and
drink
a
few
of
during
the
course
of
an
evening
not
my
favorite
stout
but
one
of
the
better
stouts
to
drink
in
session
the
roasted
notes
dominate
the
taste
theres
a
hop
inspired
finish
but
not
much
else
nice
milky
mouthfeel
sessionable
if
youre
a
fan
of
roasty
beers
i
recommend
this
beer
particularly
to
those
who
are
interested
in
the
milk
sweet
stout
style
its
not
the
best
example
of
it
but
its
pretty
damn
good
this
beer
surprised
me
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
frig
it
is
black
in
color
and
a
nice
creamy
covering
remained
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
which
provided
some
impressive
lacing
the
smell
is
what
surprised
me
the
most
with
lots
of
caramel
and
some
milk
chocalate
aromas
and
just
a
hint
of
toast
coming
through
all
the
sweet
smells
and
did
i
say
caramel
oh
yeah
the
taste
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
since
i
have
been
drinking
lots
of
stouts
lately
but
i
havent
drank
any
sweet
stouts
for
a
while
so
it
feels
a
little
lighter
in
the
mouth
almost
crisp
the
english
hops
come
through
with
a
little
bit
of
a
leafy
taste
and
also
the
caramel
malts
are
strongly
present
there
is
a
bit
of
an
astrigent
roast
taste
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
balanced
stouts
ive
ever
had
which
would
make
this
an
easy
session
beer
surprised
and
impressed
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
is
the
appearance
and
by
worst
i
simply
mean
it
is
average
i
compare
the
head
on
this
to
the
head
of
some
big
name
stouts
and
it
is
lacking
a
bit
head
is
lacy
and
clings
well
to
the
glass
but
light
overall
for
the
style
color
has
more
red
to
the
black
than
most
stouts
smell
is
sweet
and
creamy
unusual
for
a
stout
but
very
appetizing
taste
is
very
good
slightly
chocolaty
slightly
fruity
very
quaffable
and
drinkable
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
compared
to
stouts
i
have
previously
sampled
is
an
exceptional
quality
almost
a
dessert
beer
but
sweetness
is
complementary
to
the
flavor
and
not
overwhelming
one
of
the
boston
beer
companys
best
strong
chocolate
aroma
pours
smooth
with
an
average
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
lacing
bitter
taste
with
a
hint
of
strong
coffee
more
carbonation
that
your
average
stout
not
the
flat
mouthfeel
of
a
guinness
aroma
and
bitter
coffee
tast
were
a
bit
much
for
me
i
prefer
a
smoother
stout
such
as
guinness
pours
a
very
dark
brown
garnet
color
that
allows
a
bit
of
light
to
pass
through
topped
off
by
a
frothy
head
typical
of
sam
adams
very
aromatic
nose
lots
of
cream
and
chocolate
milky
smooth
flavor
with
sweet
chocolate
balanced
by
roasted
grain
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
this
is
another
strong
offering
from
sam
adams
appears
a
solid
dark
brown
color
with
a
floaty
beige
head
that
lasts
for
a
little
while
but
eventually
fades
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
chocolate
dust
and
some
coffee
grounds
taste
includes
those
flavors
and
more
with
a
nice
mellow
milky
creaminess
thrown
in
there
hence
the
name
perhaps
fair
amount
of
roasty
malt
yet
this
beer
has
hardly
any
bitterness
to
it
with
some
sweet
molases
flavoring
as
well
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
though
maybe
a
little
lighter
than
your
average
stout
a
good
one
cream
stouts
arent
my
preference
but
theres
nothing
shabby
about
this
beer
disappointed
expected
a
lot
more
from
a
milk
stout
initial
take
looked
promising
excellent
almost
black
pour
with
tan
head
nice
lacing
aroma
started
the
downhill
slide
almost
no
maltly
quality
to
it
the
taste
was
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
way
too
hoppy
no
smoothness
or
cream
to
the
brew
way
too
thin
and
carbonated
all
in
all
you
can
find
better
stouts
out
there
all
in
all
this
is
an
enjoyable
cream
stout
and
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
have
this
again
the
aroma
was
mildly
roasty
with
a
whiff
of
graininess
the
taste
was
better
than
the
aroma
suggested
with
dry
creamy
roasty
chocolaty
and
coffee
flavors
swirling
around
this
was
very
soft
and
a
little
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
a
lot
of
complexity
this
beer
has
a
typical
stout
appearance
in
that
it
is
opaque
it
pours
a
small
head
that
stays
around
for
a
brief
period
of
time
the
smell
is
almost
an
exact
replica
if
smells
is
replicatable
of
a
mild
coffee
i
am
not
a
big
coffee
drinker
but
i
love
the
smell
of
fresh
coffee
and
this
is
pretty
close
if
it
looks
like
a
duck
smells
like
a
duck
it
probably
is
a
duck
this
beer
looks
like
coffee
smells
like
coffee
so
naturally
it
tastes
a
bit
llike
coffee
possibly
with
a
bit
of
milk
or
cream
in
it
and
maybe
a
piece
of
fine
chocolate
an
intense
chocolate
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
heavy
and
sticky
for
my
taste
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
myself
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
large
sticky
tan
head
smells
like
coffee
bitter
chocolate
and
faint
spicy
hops
the
burnt
coffee
malts
hit
the
tongue
first
soon
followed
but
a
dry
chocolate
flavor
has
kind
of
a
salty
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
the
drinkablility
is
great
what
a
great
session
beer
maybe
this
stout
is
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
taste
otherwise
a
fine
brew

good

something
i
could
mistake
for
a
pnw
stout
if
it
didnt
have
such
exceptional
balance
not
only
in
regard
to
hopsmalt
but
also
in
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
it
affects
the
senses
equally
across
the
board
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
lighter
than
some
stouts
small
and
typical
stout
head
with
little
lacing
apparent
smells
of
autumn
woodfires
and
harvest
barley
with
enough
hops
to
keep
it
lively
taste
is
sublime
candied
fruits
give
way
to
a
tasty
charcoal
denseness
that
fizzles
out
onto
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
hoppy
conclusion
that
fades
ever
so
slowly
mouthfeel
may
be
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
the
smooth
coating
effect
a
creamy
feeling
if
you
will
is
just
stupendous
great
for
an
icy
high
desert
night
drinkability
is
wonderful
and
as
with
most
sam
adams
products
this
is
a
pleasure
to
quaff
for
all

now
im
ready
for
bed
sa
cream
stout
is
black
in
color
with
a
nicesized
creamy
head
decent
brussels
lace
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
i
wish
the
aroma
was
more
powerful
the
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
flavors
with
sweet
chocolate
notes
hops
mainly
come
into
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
sip
otherwise
they
serve
as
a
balancing
agent
the
finish
is
when
the
chocolate
flavors
are
strongest
ending
the
beer
on
a
sweet
note
very
drinkable
this
stout
poured
a
very
dark
redbrown
almost
black
with
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
settled
but
coated
the
glass
nicely
the
smell
was
richly
malty
and
hoppy
with
notes
of
licorice
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
very
malty
with
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
poking
through
and
with
a
nice
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
malt
and
hops
were
nicely
balanced
there
was
a
hint
of
yeast
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
full
body
and
good
carbonation
the
malty
flavors
lingered
pleasantly
on
the
palate
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
stout
a
bit
more
dry
and
lacking
the
hint
of
acidity
often
found
in
milk
stouts
but
a
very
good
stout
nonetheless
a
fine
meal
in
a
glass
great
brew
well
balanced
and
generally
just
damn
smooth
smooth
no
harshness
from
the
dark
grains
a
slightly
bitter
but
enjoyable
aftertaste
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
a
real
surprise
in
our
stout
tasting
a
smooth
drinkable
stout
not
the
best
but
solid
in
all
respects
drinkablity
is
among
the
best
of
the
beers
ive
had
goes
down
very
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
all
in
all
a
very
good
and
drinkable
stout
that
gave
me
everything
i
expect
in
this
style
i
will
definitely
check
it
out
again
and
i
think
it
has
something
to
offer
to
darkbeer
newbies
and
stout
aficionados
alike
overall
its
a
drinkable
brew
i
could
definitely
see
myself
getting
to
know
this
beer
having
a
few
pints
of
it
that
is
this
stout
has
a
slightly
lighter
mouthfeel
than
other
stouts
and
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
others
as
well
all
and
all
it
had
a
pretty
nice
body
to
it
and
was
enjoyable
possibly
my
favorite
bbc
brew
this
beer
pours
to
a
deep
brown
color
that
does
not
let
much
of
any
light
thru
the
head
is
a
light
tan
color
that
has
good
resiliency
and
retention
which
leads
to
great
lacing
through
out
the
brew
the
aromas
from
this
brew
are
very
pleasant
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
chocolate
esters
they
seem
to
have
a
nice
balance
and
not
overpowering
this
is
a
nice
tasting
brew
as
i
said
probably
my
favorite
from
bbc
the
predominant
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
with
highlights
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
charcoal
you
will
notice
the
hops
it
does
not
bite
but
offsets
the
sweetness
perfectly
this
is
a
nice
brew
one
that
is
a
standby
for
the
cooler
months
this
is
a
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
winter
because
of
this
and
fezziwig
sam
adams
definitely
has
impressed
me
as
an
american
beer
company
i
am
partial
to
english
ales
and
lesser
known
american
breweries
but
sam
adams
overwhelms
with
this
rich
black
as
night
stout
that
is
creamy
in
every
sense
a
wonderful
beer
thanks
sam
adams
for
another
exceptional
beer
pours
an
inky
black
hue
although
still
slightly
translucent
when
held
right
up
to
the
light
with
a
very
small
coffeecolored
head
rich
nose
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
coffee
and
a
touch
of
licorice
deep
dark
taste
of
chocolate
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
with
an
underlying
brininess
pervading
the
entire
palate
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
very
rich
and
creamy
on
the
whole
though
its
a
bit
much
and
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
mouthfeel
i
suppose
it
could
be
a
bit
thicker
it
is
a
stout
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
otherwise
this
beer
is
great
mouthfeel
there
is
a
lot
of
body
to
this
beer
especially
not
to
be
snooty
but
for
the
price
it
has
a
great
milky
texture
very
very
nice
stout
but
not
a
milk
stout
i
like
this
a
lot
but
its
not
at
all
sweet
the
label
tries
to
weasel
out
of
it
by
saying
its
the
cream
of
stouts
sorry
but
im
knocking
a
point
off
for
misleading
the
humble
beer
drinker
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
somewhat
thin
as
expected
but
nice
flavor
retained
a
foamy
head
throughout
and
the
last
sip
tasted
better
than
the
first
has
a
powdery
chocolate
taste
much
like
the
8
ball
i
followed
it
with
samuel
adams
makes
pretty
good
beers
just
not
as
good
as
they
claim
an
average
stout
re
drinkability
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
imo
without
a
doubt
one
of
sam
adams
best
offerings
poured
a
clear
dark
burgundy
with
an
off
white
head
the
lack
of
opacity
in
this
brew
surprised
me
because
stouts
should
never
let
even
the
slightest
bit
of
light
through
the
head
subsided
pretty
quickly
and
the
aroma
was
very
lacking
in
all
that
i
desire
from
a
stout
the
flavor
hit
a
little
closer
to
home
but
was
lacking
in
roasted
character
as
well
as
malt
complexity
basically
it
tasted
like
a
1554
black
ale
from
new
belgium
with
a
touch
more
malt
mouthfeel
was
bad
as
it
tasted
pretty
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
way
to
high
not
smooth
not
creamy
this
stout
is
not
one
i
would
ever
buy
again
but
i
was
glad
that
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
beautiful
dark
brown
color
like
dark
chocolate
thin
head
which
dissipates
slowly
with
moderate
lacing
the
smell
was
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
slight
sweetness
to
the
aroma
very
good
smell
taste
very
slight
bitter
rather
a
bit
light
tasting
considering
the
color
but
very
smooth
definite
chocolate
notes
mouthfeel
was
good
as
this
beer
sat
well
on
the
tongue
wellbalanced
also
overall
one
id
seek
out
again
not
quite
a
black
as
night
color
there
is
a
hint
of
red
when
held
up
to
the
outdoor
light
the
head
was
not
very
large
but
is
leaving
a
bit
of
a
lacing
down
my
glass
smell
is
good
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
pretty
similiar
the
cream
was
evident
at
first
but
the
hops
are
taking
over
as
i
drink
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
not
too
thick
for
a
stout
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
good
as
this
is
a
nice
tasty
stout
drinkabilitynotes
an
excellent
and
substantial
cold
weather
beer
which
exhibits
a
rich
complexity
perhaps
not
the
best
milk
stout
but
still
well
worth
a
try
this
cream
stout
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
some
amber
tones
showing
through
the
light
a
small
head
tops
off
my
pour
and
doesnt
stay
around
long
but
leaves
some
lace
in
its
wake
chocolate
malt
notes
invade
my
nose
as
well
as
some
coffee
undertones
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
and
inviting
almost
sugary
the
first
sip
is
also
quite
sweet
with
a
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
and
a
some
hints
of
coffee
and
a
little
hops
on
the
back
of
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
for
me
i
prefer
a
bit
more
body
to
my
stouts
but
it
goes
down
smooth
all
the
same
this
is
a
good
drinking
stout
when
you
are
not
looking
for
something
too
heavy
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
sams
brews
that
ive
tried
so
far
nice
full
beige
head
good
sticky
foam
opaque
black
in
color
a
complex
nose
toasted
coffee
with
cream
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
notes
in
the
aroma
smooth
initial
taste
creamy
is
the
only
adjective
i
can
come
up
with
the
carbonation
is
perfect
a
little
tingle
not
fizzy
fire
roasted
malt
gives
it
a
nice
thick
stout
taste
more
mellow
and
better
than
guinness
in
my
opinion
well
disguised
hops
round
out
the
experience
that
lingers
on
the
palate
excellent
drinkability

this
was
a
nice
cream
stout
that
is
light
on
the
cream
an
ok
beer
from
sam
adams
i
think
it
is
too
thick
not
to
say
i
dont
like
a
good
dark
beer
but
this
is
a
bit
too
dark
for
my
taste
very
creamy
and
cofeelike
not
horrable
taste
but
nothing
exceptional
either
not
bad
if
nothing
else
to
drink
but
i
would
pick
up
another
sam
adams
beer
before
this
one
a
beautiful
black
beer
that
has
a
nice
rocky
tan
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
my
glass
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
toffee
are
strong
and
inviting
the
creamy
texture
and
sweetness
are
well
balanced
with
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
that
bite
through
at
the
very
end
i
may
be
biased
as
samuel
adams
boston
lager
was
my
introduction
into
the
world
of
good
beer
so
samuel
adams
brews
have
always
been
among
my
favorite
brews
though
this
beer
is
a
bit
heavy
it
tastes
so
good
so
i
have
no
problem
with
it
being
a
session
beer
on
a
night
where
i
truly
deserve
a
treat
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
this
one
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
great
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
roasted
with
a
roasted
malt
and
nut
scent
as
well
as
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
excelent
and
smoothe
with
a
bit
of
toffee
flavor
and
a
underlying
sweetness
that
was
just
right
and
not
cloying
at
all
this
a
stout
to
use
to
convert
people
to
better
brews
for
sure
d
one
of
my
favorite
brews
by
sam
adams
solid
beer
i
just
wish
i
saw
it
on
tap
more
often
in
the
boston
area
all
in
all
quite
a
drinkable
beer
the
light
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
surprising
but
it
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
wont
weigh
you
down
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
guinness
nitrodraught
but
with
a
much
more
pronounced
coffee
note
and
a
wee
bit
more
body
but
all
the
silky
smoothness
of
the
nitro
otherwise
this
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
surprisingly
i
could
definately
see
myself
putting
a
good
number
of
these
away
im
impressed
that
this
stout
doesnt
have
the
harshness
tasted
in
other
stouts
there
is
a
creamlike
quality
to
this
stout
i
can
see
why
a
friend
spoke
so
highly
of
this
stout
too
bad
it
only
seems
to
be
available
in
florida
in
the
mix
pack
this
is
one
of
sas
better
brews
seek
it
out
poured
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
ruby
tinges
on
the
sides
impressive
dark
tancolored
head
persists
and
offers
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
are
excellent
lots
of
coffee
toasted
malt
smoke
and
caramel
flavor
mirrors
the
aromas
but
with
a
pinch
of
hop
bitterness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
starts
out
sweet
the
middle
brings
in
a
chocolatecovered
toffee
and
finishes
with
a
snap
of
bitterness
that
quickly
succumbs
to
the
roasted
coffeechocolate
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
it
could
be
a
bit
bigger
but
it
does
the
job
nicely
creamy
a
tasty
night
cap
after
a
long
postwedding
cookout
poured
a
beautiful
tar
black
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
about
34
of
an
inch
thick
quite
nice
looking
the
smell
is
very
coffee
and
slightly
dark
chocolate
very
nice
the
taste
is
absolutely
excellent
i
can
think
of
nothing
that
needs
changing
faintly
sweet
coffee
like
taste
at
first
that
quickly
turns
to
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
a
most
excellent
stout
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
just
plain
good
if
you
are
fan
of
portersstouts
you
really
need
to
give
it
a
try
nice
dark
color
and
good
head
predominant
smell
is
coffee
with
some
dark
chocolate
taste
is
mostly
of
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
personally
im
not
a
huge
fan
and
think
its
a
little
too
bitter
good
mouthfeel
pretty
balanced
ive
brought
the
drinkability
score
down
a
little
because
the
finish
is
a
little
too
harsh
or
bitter
for
me
not
bitter
in
the
good
sense
of
an
esb
but
rather
too
unpolished
like
bad
coffee
overall
though
a
fairly
decent
cream
stout
if
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
too
often
nice
a
dark
witha
craggy
tan
head
smells
malty
with
bitter
coffee
and
faint
dark
chocolate
slightly
burnt
aroma
id
like
to
see
it
be
a
little
more
pungent
but
it
smells
good
grainy
and
nutty
with
coffee
and
burnt
bitter
chocolate
malts
some
hoppiness
to
round
it
out
good
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
from
sam
adams
a
bit
on
the
lackluster
side
but
good
a
very
easy
stout
which
certainly
sometimes
welcomed
pours
a
nice
dark
reddishbrown
into
the
glass
a
nice
tan
head
settles
into
a
healthy
lace
smells
incredible
chocolates
ground
coffee
roasted
barley
a
slight
fruitiness
too
taste
silkysmooth
chocolaty
malty
and
nice
nice
coffee
tones
just
enough
hopping
to
make
the
presence
felt
a
nice
gentle
carbonation
with
a
long
delicious
finish
urges
you
to
take
another
sip
finishes
brashly
roasty
witha
javalike
closing
smack
not
too
sweet
for
a
sweet
stout
but
just
enough
to
make
you
smack
your
lips
and
say
hell
yeah
this
a
my
first
creammilk
stout
and
i
got
it
in
the
brewmasters
collection
the
color
is
a
very
dark
black
and
the
aroma
has
a
burnt
smell
to
it
there
is
a
sweetness
at
first
but
is
followed
by
a
very
burnt
chocolate
and
nut
flavor
pretty
light
tasting
for
stout
this
heavy
not
bad
this
cream
stout
pours
a
moderately
dark
color
there
was
very
little
head
formation
the
smell
is
a
mixture
of
both
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
a
smooth
mixture
of
sweety
malty
chocolate
and
coffee
a
rather
pleasant
cream
stout
but
nothing
i
would
develop
a
craving
for
and
rush
out
to
the
beer
store
to
pickup
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouth
feel
very
distinct
roasted
taste
with
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
medium
body
ends
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
is
very
welcome
as
far
as
stouts
go
id
pick
this
over
guinness
bottle
any
day
this
beer
didnt
pour
as
dark
as
most
cream
stouts
it
was
still
a
deep
hazel
that
was
not
entirely
opaque
it
has
a
thick
tan
creamy
head
and
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
heavily
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
relatively
unimpressive
with
the
cream
taste
not
being
strong
and
the
alcohol
left
entirely
uncovered
this
also
doesnt
feel
that
great
in
the
mouth
because
it
isnt
very
hearty
still
a
good
beer
thanks
to
it
being
a
cream
stout
but
not
great
not
bad
but
not
what
i
particularly
look
for
in
a
stout
for
a
cream
stout
though
right
on
the
money
its
a
stout
i
could
drink
for
a
long
session
and
the
best
sa
ive
tried
those
who
are
quick
to
disregard
sa
on
the
grounds
of
the
mass
distribution
of
their
boston
lager
need
to
sample
this
beer
before
they
label
the
brewery
as
pedestrian
i
could
go
for
one
right
now
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
into
stouts
and
you
should
be
the
low
abv
and
easy
going
down
makes
this
a
good
session
stout
while
guinness
was
my
first
stout
it
led
me
to
this
one
and
i
got
stuck
on
it
for
a
while
this
is
my
first
one
in
a
while
and
its
still
up
there
for
me
ill
have
to
seek
this
out
again
one
hell
of
a
beer
for
such
a
big
company
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
malts
near
black
but
the
light
makes
it
through
this
one
my
friends
big
heavily
carbonated
tan
head
nice
and
chunky
texture
to
it
forms
little
mounds
leaves
heavy
lacing
nice
not
bad
at
all
aroma
very
nice
cream
texture
wow
slight
coffee
espresso
mix
with
soft
creamy
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
lactic
acid
semi
subdued
hopping
but
nice
subtle
flowery
mix
in
the
background
taste
a
very
very
tasty
balanced
cream
stout
awesome
mix
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
with
that
creamy
edge
you
just
cant
go
wrong
wow
this
is
a
winner
sam
adams
has
been
trying
to
come
out
as
a
macro
in
the
past
year
pushing
the
light
and
crazy
commercials
and
what
not
but
this
brewmasters
collection
is
a
gift
to
us
original
good
beer
drinkers
mouthfeel
creamy
texture
medium
to
full
bodied
but
carbonation
is
dead
on
very
smooth
drinker
here
drinkability
cant
really
be
touched
one
of
the
best
cream
stouts
ive
tried
in
general
great
representation
way
too
easy
to
sip
on
all
day
nice
brew
i
am
impressed
great
beer
for
any
brewer
good
job
to
the
folks
at
boston
brewing
sam
adams
cream
stout
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
with
staying
power
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
chocolate
and
sweet
vanilla
chocolate
coffee
and
malted
milk
dominate
the
taste
with
a
bittersweet
finish
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
like
on
the
palate
but
that
is
a
minor
quibble
a
smooth
nicely
balanced
quite
drinkable
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
unfortunately
the
boston
beer
co
didnt
do
it
for
me
this
time
the
beer
poured
black
in
color
with
a
condensed
tan
head
that
held
together
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
was
decent
enough
very
roasted
the
taste
however
seemed
very
uninspiring
to
me
quite
watery
in
body
roasted
grains
are
noticeable
and
a
definite
coffee
taste
as
well
not
much
in
the
line
of
sweetness
or
creaminess
which
seemed
odd
given
the
name
a
little
bitter
even
quite
a
dry
finish
and
forgetable
as
well
ill
stick
with
mackeson
drinkability
probably
my
favorite
sa
product
id
hazard
their
best
bottled
one
too
damn
this
stuff
is
fine
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
beer
probably
the
best
readily
available
cream
stout
made
possibly
the
best
beer
that
boston
beer
company
makes
a
solid
cream
stout
with
a
good
lactose
bitterness
and
though
id
likely
find
others
of
this
type
before
this
one
id
still
have
it
again
if
someone
handed
me
one
the
smell
was
kind
of
plain
for
a
stout
the
taste
was
pretty
good
with
some
cream
somewhat
apparent
it
gives
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
really
opens
up
the
drinkability
sampled
11504
drink
it
at
room
temperature
for
sure
i
started
mine
slightly
chilled
and
was
not
impressed
by
the
flavors
upon
reaching
room
temp
it
was
a
smooth
beauty
i
was
quite
glad
to
see
this
sixer
at
jungle
jims
just
north
of
cincy
this
beer
is
actually
my
favorite
bbc
product
ive
tried
it
pours
a
deep
rich
black
with
a
smooth
tan
head
aroma
was
full
of
coffeeroasted
malts
first
taste
didnt
let
me
down
tons
of
roasted
malt
was
easily
apparent
the
fantastic
flavor
of
coffeetoffee
followed
a
very
very
smooth
stout
that
manages
to
avoid
a
thin
mouthfeel
i
feel
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
sessions
beers
if
only
it
were
easily
available
in
lafayette
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
i
could
finish
a
6pack
of
this
pretty
quickly
only
complaint
i
have
is
paying
78
for
a
six
pack
for
a
low
abv
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
a
meal
though
a
very
nice
stout
good
lacing
the
whole
way
good
balance
of
sweetness
without
being
sickening
revisit
maybe
i
got
an
off
bottle
but
im
not
seeing
all
the
flaws
i
noted
earlier
in
this
brew
still
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
have
to
kick
it
up
in
mouthfeel
and
taste
i
got
some
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
still
a
bit
ragged
and
disjointed
in
my
book
though
there
are
still
better
stouts
drinkability
notes
easy
to
quaff
by
far
one
of
my
top
stouts
as
i
seem
to
have
it
around
a
lot
also
the
fresh
batches
seem
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
bite
to
them
try
and
find
bottle
of
this
when
it
is
at
its
ripe
point
where
the
month
is
notched
on
the
side

seems
to
be
a
bit
more
mellow
notes
a
very
good
stout
its
not
too
bitter
and
it
isnt
too
sweet
its
just
right
this
is
less
aggressive
than
some
of
the
outstanding
stouts
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
features
a
nice
combination
of
mediumlight
black
malt
bitterness
and
medium
creaminess
without
getting
too
butterythick
or
sweet
an
exceptional
light
stout
and
session
material
all
the
way
it
is
black
with
a
ruby
tinge
and
a
thin
tan
head
there
is
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
fairly
thin
for
a
stout
with
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
it
sort
of
disappears
in
the
finish
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
just
average
for
a
sweet
stout
the
beer
as
it
splits
from
the
bottle
a
deep
black
walnut
color
with
some
nice
ruby
high
light
the
head
humongous
creamy
in
texture
and
a
nice
light
chocolate
brown
with
the
lace
forming
a
thick
cover
to
conceal
the
glass
lightly
toasted
grain
aroma
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
vanilla
quite
a
pleasant
sniff
and
start
is
sweet
and
thick
with
malt
top
is
middling
to
full
in
feel
finish
is
judicious
in
its
carbonation
and
the
hops
deliberate
in
their
spicy
bite
droughty
aftertaste
that
is
long
lasting
a
drinkable
beer
but
one
i
sample
rarely
as
there
are
just
too
many
great
stouts
and
i
sometimes
forget
that
these
are
quite
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
worthy
of
a
sample
now
and
then
this
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
in
the
future
i
was
disappointed
especially
since
i
liked
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
had
last
week
so
much
glad
to
see
this
getting
some
build
up
this
year
in
the
the
winter
classics
and
the
brewmasters
collection
i
worry
about
this
and
boston
ale
getting
neglected
you
shouldnt
overlook
either
overall
a
good
drinkable
stout
nothing
really
special
but
one
of
the
more
available
ones
thats
also
reasonably
priced
its
no
shakespeare
but
in
this
bud
lightmiller
lite
saturated
world
its
good
to
have
around
sam
cream
stout
while
still
enjoyable
is
not
as
big
and
bold
as
i
once
remember
it
it
starts
out
great
with
a
nice
dark
dark
brown
colour
with
amber
hints
throughout
this
is
complimented
by
a
big
chunky
tan
head
thats
nice
and
sticky
the
smell
is
quite
thin
here
chocolate
and
malt
are
apparent
but
almost
a
backdrop
to
the
main
smell
of
well
almost
nothing
smells
kind
of
watery
at
times
this
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
starts
off
smooth
and
a
bit
sweet
and
finishes
dry
with
a
smokey
wood
flavour
that
hints
at
a
touch
of
coffee
nice
there
is
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
here
for
a
cream
stout
this
one
is
still
good
but
again
not
as
great
as
in
the
past
when
it
was
seemingly
a
bit
more
adventuresome
note
very
sweet
after
a
few
sips
and
becomes
more
bitter
sam
adams
cream
stout
when
poured
has
a
very
nutty
scent
to
it
at
first
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
coffee
smell
to
it
but
after
a
few
sips
the
coffee
taste
subsides
and
this
beer
is
great
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
at
all
but
i
dig
this
beer
althought
i
can
only
drink
one
or
two
more
of
it
before
it
would
get
to
me
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
flavorful
and
aromatic
id
love
to
place
it
in
a
session
with
other
cream
stouts
to
see
how
it
would
compare
sidebyside
samuel
adams
cream
stout
is
decent
but
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
coffeedominant
beer
cut
that
part
of
the
flavor
profile
back
a
few
notches
bulk
up
the
body
a
little
and
this
would
be
a
very
good
milk
stout
dark
brownblack
creamy
head
not
too
thick
but
inviting
smells
nice
with
big
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
and
some
charcoal
flavors
follow
with
roasted
malts
and
another
touch
of
charcoal
mellow
at
first
with
a
nice
bite
on
the
finish
a
good
easy
drinking
stout
one
of
sam
adams
better
offerings
this
pours
a
jet
black
with
slight
brown
tints
on
the
edges
there
is
a
thick
fluffy
head
with
little
lacing
the
smell
is
a
earthy
blend
of
rosted
malts
and
a
slight
coffee
note
taste
is
a
burnt
toffee
with
a
creamy
chocolate
and
mocha
taste
very
nice
blend
of
burnt
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
round
it
out
the
aftertaste
is
a
sublte
coffee
taste
with
a
milky
smoothness
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
silky
brew
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
ive
come
to
have
a
rather
jaundiced
view
of
this
brewery
seeing
it
as
a
macro
with
acceptance
issues
i
expected
a
really
lame
attempt
at
a
stout
this
is
the
first
beer
from
the
deep
dark
recesses
of
my
past
that
hasnt
proved
disappointing
in
the
cold
light
of
day
i
guess
ill
have
to
check
out
more
boston
beer
co
products
not
the
light
beer
though
and
see
if
they
surprise
me
too
beef
notes
one
of
my
alltme
favorites
this
beer
almost
leaves
me
speechless
its
even
one
that
many
nonbeer
drinkers
dont
mind
and
at
7
a
six
pack
youre
not
going
to
find
better
bang
for
your
buck
ill
be
drinking
this
for
some
time
to
come
as
part
of
the
the
winter
classics
case
i
can
say
that
along
with
the
old
fezziwig
ale
this
is
the
best
of
the
lot
a
good
daily
drinking
stoutnot
too
heavy
sweet
or
complex
it
still
has
enough
going
on
to
satisfy
my
stout
cravings
smoke
coffee
cocoa
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
it
would
probably
go
well
with
bbq
and
smoked
sausages
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
coffee
baking
chocolate
and
ice
cream
tasted
rich
and
creamy
the
aromas
follow
up
in
the
taste
with
soft
chocolate
milk
shake
flavors
and
dry
finsh
good
balance
in
the
malthops
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
that
hits
the
mark
as
advertised
note
i
think
this
is
the
only
cream
stout
ive
ever
had
so
i
can
only
compare
it
to
other
stouts
i
read
that
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
pretty
nice
since
quaffing
this
regularly
in
days
past
ive
certainly
discovered
far
more
appealing
stouts
nonetheless
respectable
and
its
nice
to
see
bbc
is
still
making
quality
beer
drinkability
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
so
far
goes
down
surprisingly
easily
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
nearly
opaque
body
with
a
reasonable
head
albeit
not
as
dense
as
i
would
hope
laces
very
nicely
down
the
glass
as
contents
empty
thick
coffeemalt
essence
and
the
taste
follows
right
along
those
lines
a
good
stout
but
not
a
smooth
as
i
expected
from
a
cream
stout
and
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
a
few
other
stouts
ive
had
definitely
worth
your
time
pours
a
with
a
beatiful
tan
cascading
head
that
holds
up
well
the
beer
itself
black
with
ruby
highlights
strong
sweet
coffee
aroma
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
taste
is
dominated
by
coffee
bitter
chocolate
some
caramel
maltiness
pokes
through
as
well
not
too
complex
here
this
is
thinner
than
expected
making
this
a
fairly
drinkable
stout
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
a
fairly
good
stout
enjoyed
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
good
sam
adams
brew
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
appearance
poured
a
nice
head
but
soon
disappeared
within
a
minute
or
two
but
on
the
other
hand
the
lacing
around
the
beer
was
there
the
entire
time
pour
out
a
medium
black
in
color
smell
consisted
of
coffee
chocolate
and
some
cream
taste
was
quite
good
started
out
with
some
espressocoffee
then
finished
with
some
milkcreamy
aftertaste
quite
good
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
during
the
winter
nights
i
would
recommend
this
beer
go
for
it
sam
what
are
you
waiting
for
burnt
caramel
with
a
fluffy
coco
head
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
notes
on
the
nose
medium
creamy
body
that
stays
full
despite
its
lack
of
girth
soft
roasted
flavors
accentuated
with
notes
of
chocolate
finishes
dry
and
clean
and
very
satisfying
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
stout
ive
ever
had
restores
some
of
my
faith
in
sam
adams
my
new
favorite
sa
brew
pours
with
a
thick
namesakey
head
dark
enough
not
to
let
any
light
through
the
glass
excellent
threading
head
is
persistent
yellowtannish
and
globby
smooth
mouthfeel
and
taste
creamily
thick
but
taste
is
a
little
thin
tastes
of
malt
strangely
it
says
it
uses
unmalted
barley
i
have
no
explanation
coffee
and
i
couldnt
identify
the
sharp
dark
chocolate
until
i
checked
the
label
but
it
is
there
like
i
said
it
is
an
excellent
flavor
but
not
exceptionally
complex
or
rich
very
enjoyable
and
id
like
another
but
it
is
not
one
id
drink
to
be
overly
philosophical
about
the
taste
its
just
good
a
great
stout
that
is
full
of
flavor
very
drinkable
and
wont
knock
you
for
a
loop
after
a
bottle
or
two
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
creamy
finish
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
black
barley
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
tastes
a
lot
like
milk
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
drinking
beer
a
good
stout
ithis
is
the
second
stout
i
ever
had
way
back
in
1993
or
94
it
is
as
good
as
ever
today
i
am
glad
they
are
still
making
it
a
very
goodlooking
stout
that
tastes
great
pours
to
a
deep
rubyblack
color

had
that
stays
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
with
vanilla
butter
cookies
and
maple

is
a
good
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
with
roasted
coffee
abnd
dark
chocolate
and
creamy
flavors
throughout
nice
full
mouthfeel
finishes
roasty
and
bittersweet
with
a
bit
of
dryness
a
luscoius
well
made
stout
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
mediocre
i
was
very
surprised
the
taste
is
very
good
full
of
dark
and
burnt
malts
witout
being
overly
bitter
big
gobs
of
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
are
followed
by
a
nice
cascade
of
slightly
bitter
burnt
malts
body
and
mouthfeel
are
on
the
mediumfull
side
an
easy
drinking
stout
and
readily
obtainable
another
from
the
2003
winter
pack
from
sams
poured
a
cloudy
black
in
the
glass
and
the
head
was
healthy
large
and
clingy
the
taste
was
cream
coffee
stouty
if
thats
a
word
great
brew
from
the
bbc
really
smooth
going
down
one
of
sams
better
offering
imo
the
head
is
mediumsmall
fast
and
tan
it
collapses
coarsely
the
beer
is
pretty
much
black
with
dark
brownred
highlights
against
the
light
a
very
nice
aroma
of
roasty
mocha
chocolate
the
light
roasty
bitter
front
passes
through
a
fizzy
yet
thickish
middle
quite
bitter
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
metal
bit
of
a
smoky
aftertaste
overall
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
after
the
great
aroma
very
dark
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
if
you
hold
it
to
the
light
tan
head
that
dissapates
rapidly
aroma
is
fairly
potent
comprising
of
coffee
roastiness
and
to
a
lesser
extent
malt
and
chocolate
coffee
is
fairly
evident
to
the
taste
along
with
a
rich
maltiness
hops
are
probably
in
there
somewhere
but
hidden
by
the
malts
they
balance
out
well
goes
down
very
smooth
suprisingly
good
effort
from
sam
notes
a
fairly
tasty
stout
albeit
a
tad
unbalanced
it
pours
a
browntinged
tar
color
with
a
solid
light
tan
head
the
mild
aroma
is
of
smoke
sweet
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
the
creamy
malt
is
loaded
with
a
sweet
coffee
with
a
good
dose
of
half
half
chocolate
and
light
smoky
taste
a
tealike
bitterness
and
a
faint
taste
of
limes
offers
a
touch
of
citrus
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
very
dark
brown
pour
with
a
medium
beige
head
which
collapses
into
a
very
rings
of
lace
nose
is
bitterweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
not
very
strong
initial
sip
reveals
a
creamy
and
rich
mouthfeel
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
background
taste
echos
the
nose
and
burnt
coffee
taste
comes
in
at
about
mid
glass
seems
a
bit
watered
down
for
a
stout
finish
is
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
aromas
of
roasted
chaff
seem
to
promise
some
level
of
concentration
but
on
the
palate
it
just
sits
there
is
an
adequate
balance
of
roasted
grain
sugar
and
bitter
burned
coffee
flavors
but
they
are
dilute
and
uninteresting
the
texture
is
watery
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
sam
adams
lineup
a
soild
black
with
a
thin
but
persistent
tan
head
leaves
behind
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
of
chocolate
and
espresso
rich
flavor
with
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
slight
metallic
note
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
good
stout
year
after
year
a
great
beer
pours
black
with
a
just
a
hint
of
ruby
color
around
the
edges
of
my
glass
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
ring
of
foam
and
some
lace
aroma
of
burnt
grains
and
espresso
coffee
beans
the
first
sip
is
full
of
fairly
intense
roasted
flavors
hops
play
a
supporting
role
here
and
are
in
the
background
a
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
stout
much
more
of
roasted
coffee
character
than
i
remember
and
not
as
sweet
an
odd
flavor
towards
the
finish
that
i
cant
express
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
with
the
bitterness
coming
from
the

it

flattens

after
the

creamed

the
mouthfeel

of

emerges
midway
through
finish
has
lingering
flavors
of

and
a
mild
bitterness
remains
from
the
hops
odd
soy
sauce
like
taste
mingles
with
the
flavors
in
the
finish
for
an
undesirable
quality
less
sweet
and
a
touch
drier
than
i
anticipated
with
so
many
stouts
available
this
one
doesnt
rank
as
a
favorite
drinkabilitynotes
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
its
bitterness
and
relatively
light
body
make
it
almost
refreshing
maybe
not
summer
barbecue
refreshing
but
it
might
be
a
good
morethanone
choice
for
an
après
skicigarfire
kind
of
night
not
the
heartiest
stout
out
there
but
quite
tasty
albeit
a
bit
bitter
at
about
5
abv
it
wont
last
forever
but
i
might
go
back
in
a
month
or
so
to
see
if
the
hops
mellow
out
a
bit
its
even
better
on
tap
sometimes
available
at
doyles
in
jamaica
plain
near
the
brewery
dark
brown
with
small
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
creamy
smooth
and
slightly
hoppy
taste
is
same
as
aroma
but
its
much
too
weak
mouthfeel
too
thin
this
would
however
make
a
good
session
stout
im
just
a
little
bitter
because
for
9
a
six
i
was
expecting
more
should
have
gone
with
their
double
bock
drinkability
a
solid
stout
but
not
as
creamy
or
soft
as
it
should
be
imo
worth
trying
at
least
once
pours
with
a
fairly
good
tan
head
and
an
almost
black
color
just
a
little
hint
of
ruby
brown
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
sweet
malty
creamy
aroma
with
hints
of
roasted
grains
and
mocha
balanced
taste
and
fairly
smooth
until
you
get
the
explosion
of
carbonation
in
your
mouth
imo
this
beer
has
too
much
carbonation
and
it
takes
away
from
the
flavor
and
balance
of
this
beer
some
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
good
but
not
one
of
there
best
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
regular
stouts
but
i
dont
see
it
much
in
sixpacks
up
here
a
welcome
part
of
the
sampler
one
of
bbcs
better
beers
id
have
to
say
ive
always
been
fond
of
this
beer
my
first
favorite
from
this
brewery
and
its
status
hasnt
changed
this
poured
a
black
color
with
a
caramel
colored
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
bit
the
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
was
evident
but
not
overpowering
the
body
was
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
definitely
had
a
soft
texture
on
my
tongue
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
jump
out
and
little
bitterness
is
detected
some
chocolate
flavors
sneeked
through
after
swallowing
a
nice
sweet
stout
just
wish
the
body
was
a
little
thicker
f
deep
dark
brown
body
but
paired
with
a
very
small
light
brown
head
bottle
not
100
smells
of
roastysweet
malts
a
little
chocolate
and
some
hops
taste
is
roasted
vanilla
semisweet
chocolate
malts
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
creamy
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
the
best
sa
product
ive
had
so
far
yep
a
very
nice
and
flavorful
stout
that
left
me
wanting
more
very
small
head
very
grainey
intial
smell
a
little
cocoa
on
the
2nd
very
coffeeish
on
the
third
first
taste
mocha
like
with
a
roasted
coffee
aftertaste
actually
had
sort
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
just
thought
there
would
be
a
creamier
texture
texture
even
got
a
little
harsh
in
the
middle
settled
down
ok
towards
end
the
names
a
little
misleading
but
its
a
good
enouh
brew
super
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
with
a
tannish
thick
medium
sized
head
that
retained
well
for
a
time
eventually
fading
to
a
solid
skim
lacing
in
ink
blot
patches
and
spots
smell
is
roasty
deep
and
sweetly
and
coffeeish
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
overlays
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
smooth
body
with
an
overall
sweetish
dark
roastyness
with
a
dark
caramel
thats
pretty
nice
and
easy
to
handle
as
the
beer
warms
the
chocolate
tones
appear
more
so
towards
the
middle
and
finish
with
some
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
an
overall
creamyness
that
slides
right
down
but
has
some
carbonation
along
the
way
that
doesnt
fit
with
what
flavors
very
well
a
nice
stout
that
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
i
tried
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
and
thought
it
was
absolutely
terrible
i
bought
the
sams
winter
sampler
pack
and
my
old
nemesis
was
inside
i
tried
it
again
and
this
time
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
more
palatable
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
coffee
which
this
beer
tastes
like
from
sip
to
aftertaste
still
is
pretty
good
warmed
me
up
on
a
cold
minnesota
night
this
cream
stout
is
completly
black
some
light
will
reveal
a
hint
of
amber
around
the
edges
there
is
a
nice
sized
tan
head
topping
it
off
with
nice
amounts
of
lacing
coating
the
glass
the
aroma
is
great
with
strong
chocolateroasted
malts
doing
the
talking
as
for
the
taste
it
is
dominated
by
roasted
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
hops
for
good
balance
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
fairly
light
bodied
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
sam
adams
cream
stout
yummm
this
beer
is
excellent
i
found
a
case
on
sale
for
12
99
yes
24
bottles
that
had
an
expiration
date
of
next
month
score
one
for
the
little
guy
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
solid
tan
head
that
if
poured
correctly
will
last
the
entire
glass
i
find
that
this
beer
is
much
more
enjoyable
if
allowed
to
warm
up
also
i
reccomend
keeping
it
in
your
fridge
and
then
pulling
it
out
about
30
minutes
before
to
let
it
warm
to
a
few
degrees
below
room
temperature
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
substantial
and
there
is
a
slight
malt
bitterness
that
gives
it
a
backbone
upon
which
it
props
roasted
barley
choco
burnt
nut
and
sweet
sugar
tastes
the
finish
is
lengthy
and
full
this
is
worlds
better
than
guinness
and
has
a
certain
sweetness
not
overwhelming
in
the
least
that
gives
it
a
more
full
character
the
best
sam
a
brew
ive
had
to
date
this
might
be
an
easier
drinking
stout
than
guinness
as
the
roasted
bitterness
is
much
more
accessible
to
your
average
drinker
in
this
beer
i
would
see
no
problem
in
substituting
this
for
guinness
while
enjoying
the
classic
stout
accompaniment
oysters
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
first
allow
me
to
say
that
i
drank
this
two
months
past
its
prime
damn
you
martignettis
nonetheless
this
was
a
nice
stout
poured
a
black
stout
color
with
an
adequate
tan
head
aroma
was
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
not
terribly
strong
smelling
taste
was
of
burnt
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
burnt
malts
and
hops
gave
it
a
bit
of
a
zing
still
this
was
a
very
smooth
stout
the
roasted
flavor
almost
like
peanuts
remains
on
the
palate
long
after
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
and
i
wish
i
could
have
tasted
it
before
its
expiration
date
this
was
actually
a
little
better
than
i
was
expecting
dark
brown
but
not
opaque
with
a
medium
thick
and
creamy
beige
head
thin
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
coffee
and
is
slightly
smoky
mediumbodied
and
creamy
with
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
flavor
it
is
a
little
on
the
carbonated
side
unfortunately
the
finish
is
mostly
bitter
with
coffee
and
hops
overall
this
is
an
admirable
attempt
at
the
style
by
sam
adams
im
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
and
am
even
more
surprised
with
the
results
poured
from
the
usual
sa
12ounce
bottle
its
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
lingers
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
make
for
a
very
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
full
that
wonderful
roasted
malt
that
lets
you
know
youre
drinking
a
real
stout
this
is
a
much
better
stout
than
i
expected
and
one
ill
happily
drink
again
nice
chocoalteroast
taste
in
it
with
the
right
balance
of
hops
thrown
in
for
good
mieasure
sweet
after
taste
feels
greatcreamy
and
smooth
in
your
mouth
clean
taste
all
around
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
full
of
flavor
rich
creamy
robust
great
dessert
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
sittin
in
my
chair
watching
football
but
i
could
easily
drink
it
with
some
rocky
road
ice
cream
from
braums
mmmmm

wow
i
am
blown
away
i
never
thought
that
this
stalwart
of
the
boston
beer
co
would
be
this
good
where
do
i
start
the
amazing
frothy
bubbly
head
the
insanely
captivating
chocolatey
roasted
malt
aroma
the
dense
balanced
and
bursting
with
malt
cavalcade
of
flavors
oh
forget
it
just
go
buy
it
its
a
nobrainer
a
truly
perfect
stout
i
had
seven
of
these
last
night
at
the
pub
and
its
amazing
that
i
waited
this
long
to
try
something
that
has
been
out
so
long
and
is
so
widely
available
i
think
i
found
my
new
favorite
session
beer
excellent
the
only
thing
i
was
not
pleased
with
with
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
little
less
that
i
had
expected
this
was
my
first
cream
stout
and
it
was
great
a
nice
chocolatecoffecreamy
flavor
much
more
mild
than
a
normal
stout
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
apperance
is
great
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
reminded
me
of
a
nice
snowy
christmas
day
i
think
this
flavor
would
go
great
in
icecream
beautiful
dark
chocolate
color
with
lingering
head
nice
coffee
aroma
with
a
taste
that
matches
the
aroma
full
bodied
flavor
with
a
decent
rounded
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
suggests
a
good
iced
coffee
with
an
excellent
malt
balance
a
nice
brew
to
end
the
night
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
this
is
an
amazing
and
often
overlooked
sam
adams
its
not
as
astringently
bitter
as
some
stouts
extremely
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
full
flavors
it
almost
reminds
me
of
mackeson
xxx
or
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
but
taken
down
a
notch
a
must
try
not
your
normal
sam
adams
hmmm

with

a

and
a

semichewy

transports
a
nice
mocha
flavor
to
the
gut
a
favorable
black

astringency
stays
behind
to
keep
your
buds
company
awhile
a
tasty
easy
draining
stout
and
one
of
sams
finest
dark
brown
nearly
black
head
is
light
brown
and
frothy
but
very
small
and
runs
away
quickly
aroma
is
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
coffee
with
hints
of
raisin
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
and
molasses
with
a
coffee
finish
not
as
bitter
as
the
smell
would
suggest
smooth
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
uneven

comes
down
the
glass
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
decent
beer
but
perhaps
not
my
first
choice
pours
out
thick
black
and
creamy
however
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
aroma
it
smelled
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
but
had
an
acrid
metallicness
in
the
nose
as
well
nothing
really
seemed
to
stand
out
in
the
flavor
decent
chocolatey
maltiness
but
hops
were
tough
to
find
an
average
stout
deep
and
dark
brown
color
with
a
finely
rising
rocky
head
of
12
an
inch
and
coating
lacing
properties
a
sense
of
mocha
and
milk
to
the
deep
aromas
rising
on
a
swirl
mellow
and
thick
chocolate
and
toffee
begin
the
malt
assertion
a
roasty
and
smoky
bite
does
most
of
the
balancing
here
with
little
noticeable
hops
nice
full
finish
with
a
broad
and
pleasant
sweetness
to
the
aftertaste
so
i
still
wonder
what
lock
thought
was
missing
nice
pour
velvety
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
smokiness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
eminently
drinkable
with
a
nice
aftertaste
i
tend
to
prefer
my
milk
stouts
a
bit
sweeter
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
trun
one
of
these
down
nicely
done
i
just
hope
it
sticks
around
poured
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
with
a
beautiful
white
head
head
faded
quickly
but
lace
struck
on
the
glass
rich
malty
flavor
with
an
adequate
amount
of
hops
to
balance
very
complex
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
i
had
in
my
mind
for
some
weird
reason
that
this
would
not
be
a
good
beer
happy
to
say
i
proved
myself
wrong
abia
2003
sweetish
start
with
some
nice
roasty
coffee
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
lightly
creamy
texture
nothing
extravagant
but
solid
a
very
drinkable
stout
in
away
i
was
surprised
that
the
finsih
had
a
bit
of
length
quite
ok
by
me
and
better
than
a
lot
of
stouts
from
the
bigger
brewers
this
was
a
really
nice
little
stout
poured
a
deep
brown
that
unlike
many
stouts
actually
looked
brown
not
black
to
me
about
a
quarterinch
of
creamcolored
head
when
poured
in
a
pint
glass
light
scents
of
malted
milk
balls
which
reminds
me
i
should
eat
some
whoppers
soon
and
coffee
beans
this
beer
starts
with
a
creamy
almost
chocolatemilklike
taste
and
feel
and
carries
a
roasted
flavor
to
the
slightly
bitter
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
all
around
its
not
terribly
fullbodied
for
a
stout
but
as
a
cream
stout
you
kind
of
expect
that
more
milky
texture
anyhow
very
wellexecuted
beer
deep
brownish
red
thin
off
white

and

of

careful
this
stuff
goes
down

a

its

this
is
not
bad
pours
a
dark
dark
dark
dark
brown
with
a
nice
big

nice
roasty

balance
the
beer
well
so
it
is

overly
sweet

creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
its
nice
to
see
an
american
macro
like
sam
adams
brew
quality
beer
like
this
a
very
good
stout
this
cream
stout
poured
a
velvety
black
color
with
a
medium
sized
sandy
brown
head
which
dissapated
to
a
thin
film
that
stayed
the
length
of
the
beer
sweet
roasted
chocolate
malt
aroma
a
little
chalky
and
a
tiny
hint
of
chemical
smell
also
very
thick
rich
mouthfeel
with
low
level
carbonation
awesome
roasted
taste
mostly
mocha
with
toffee
and
unsweetened
cocoa
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
lace
clung
to
the
entire
glass
all
the
way
down
a
very
delicious
stout
that
left
my
motuh
watering
for
another
very
decent
sweet
stout
it
poured
black
with
a
pretty
fair
sized
tan
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
a
sweet
melted
chocolate
and
malt
aromas
on
first
taste
there
was
a
fair
bit
of
toffee
and
coffee
as
well
with
the
chocolate
becoming
a
little
more
bitter
my
only
complaint
was
this
may
be
a
tad
too
chalky
in
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
stout
what
a
highly
drinkable
stout
this
is
pours
pretty
dark
brown
almost
opaque
and
a
moderate
tan
head
dissappears
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
chocolatey
malt
flavor
a
slightly
sharp
bitter
coffee
comes
in
on
the
finish
i
enjoy
this
stout
very
often
always
a
perfect
session
stout
this
is
a
beer
that
i
revisit
a
lot
a
very
good
offering
from
bbc
in
my
opinion
the
apperance
is
very
nice
its
a
nice
dark
black
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
head
tasted
and
i
know
that
your
going
to
think
that
i
am
crazy
but
it
kind
of
tasted
like
blood
the
actual
beer
itself
was
very
nice
too
it
was
a
little
bitter
at
first
taste
but
mellowed
out
quickly
is
this
stuff
actually
brewed
with
milk
it
kind
of
has
a
milkycreamy
taste
to
it
so
i
would
think
so
the
aftertaste
was
of
a
chocolatey
origin
and
also
clung
to
the
tastebuds
in
my
mouth
since
its
a
cream
ale
it
coated
my
mouth
pretty
good
and
left
a
lasting
taste
its
my
first
cream
ale
but
i
would
rank
it
pretty
high
poured
a
very
very
dark
brown
on
the
verge
of
black
with
a
tan
head
of
foam
the
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
that
is
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
roasted
coffee
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
a
grainy
malty
flavor
this
was
a
well
balanced
and
complex
cream
stout
i
will
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
cream
stouts
that
ive
tasted
so
far
pours
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
spotty
layer
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
are
the
aromas
jumping
out
at
me
taste
is
also
coffee
bitter
notes
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
too
smoky
aftertaste
compliments
the
other
flavors
well
a
little
thinner
mouthfeel
that
i
had
hoped
for
but
smooth
none
the
less
the
best
samuel
adams
offering
i
have
had
and
i
will
buy
this
one
again
cheers
what
an
awesome
brew
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
an
extremely
fluffy
cream
colored
head
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
i
even
picked
up
on
some
maple
syrup
in
the
aroma
the
chocolate
and
malts
come
through
the
most
in
the
taste
with
a
coffee
flavored
aftertaste
this
beer
is
especially
smooth
and
creamy
just
as
the
name
would
suggest
this
was
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
great
brew
and
there
is
no
doubt
it
will
become
a
regular
the
color
was
rich
and
deep
dark
blackishbrown
fluffy
tan
head
rests
attractively
on
top
of
brew
aromas
and
flavors
of

coffee

the

the
flavor
profile
is
world
class
intense
somewhat
complex
and
nicely
balanced
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
espresso
that
slowly
subsides
to
reveal
a
rich
underlying
malt
sweetness
with
chocolate
notes
the
middle
has
a
slight
roast
bitterness
that
fades
allowing
a
nice
burst
of
lemon
to
come
forward
the
finish
is
a
slightly
sweet
lingering
espresso
flavor
that
is
slightly
tart
the

is
completely
hidden
o
a
good
overall
brew
nice
coffee
flavor
but
not
as
unique
as
i
imagined
it
to
be
does
not
compete
with
many
other
coffee
stouts
served
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
looked
almost
exactly
like
a
flat
glass
of
cocacola
right
down
to
the
thin
spotty
head

of
espresso
roasted

with

flash
of

fairly
thin
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
alcohol
almost
completely
disguised
but
you
start
to
taste
it
and
feel
it
a
few
sips
in
this
is
a
beer
without
many
flaws
and
without
many
memorable
features
either
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
pouring
an
splash
of
iced
coffee
with
a
twist
of
lemon
in
a
milk
stout
might
end
up
with
the
same
result
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
find
it
to
be
one
dimensional
12
oz
bottle
poured
in
a
snifter
coffee
flavor
was
just
not
as
enjoyable
in
this
one
for
me
in
my
opinion
the
lemon
peel
possibly
because
of
something
i
drank
before
it
added
a
bitterness
that
made
this
undrinkable
for
me
base
flavor
of
corn
and
wheat
hefty
amount
of
dry
espresso
lemon
peel

faint
finish
is
dry
with
some

im
not
getting
a
lot
of
espresso
but
its
a
great
tasting
beer
so
i
really
dont
care
decent
brew
definitely
something
different
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
feel
full
though
not
rich
not
memorable
fit
the
stout
profile
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
with
3540
ibus
i
may
have
to
use
this
as
a
starting
point
to
create
my
own
the
lemon
and
stout
go
together
quite
nicely
surprisingly
1
bottle
is
plenty
for
a
while
but
recommended
if
you
want
to
try
something
decidedly
different
big
coffee
and
toasty
dark
brown
malts
for
the
most
part
comes
short
on
the
body
and
roast
for
me
a
bit
but
cant
complain
on
the
fresh
espresso
tones
lemon
peel
doesnt
do
much
and
i
fail
to
seen
the
point
in
using
it
yes
the
taste
taste
like
beer
well
constructed
beer
and
enjoyable
on
a
wintry
day
deep
dark
brown
in
color
the
nose
has
definite
coffee
notes
the
flavor
profile
includes
both
roasted
malts
and
coffee
the
finish
is
nicely
roasted
and
with
a
bitter
cocoa
essence
eric
overall
not
bad
it
is
much
different
from
most
of
the
stouts
and
porters
ive
had
but
maybe
not
one
that
id
seek
out
going
forward
o
one
of
my
biggest
letdowns
to
date
this
is
the
third
craft
beer
in
10
years
that
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
just
couldnt
muscle
thru
it
however
it
was
my
first
time
drinking
it
and
i
am
hoping
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
will
be
giving
it
another
try
and
if
its
any
better
review
will
be
adjusted
highly
disappointing
considering
southern
tier
really
impresses
me
otherwise

this

i
probably
exaggerated
about
how
bad
it
was
above
truth
be
told
as
i
progressed
through
my
glass
it
grew
on
me
still
wont
get
it
again
overall
a
good
winter
seasonal
that
stops
short
of
really
hammering
down
on
any
one
particular
flavor
i
would
have
loved
more
coffee
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
never
been
let
down
by
a
southern
tier
offering
so
obviously
i
enjoy
the
sweetness
they
add
to
their
beers
this
one
is
interesting
enough
but
i
see
it
as
nothing
more
than
a
creative
recipe
that
is
fun
to
try
but
doesnt
exactly
leave
you
wanting
more
the
taste
of
the
beer
seemed
very
artificial
to
me
you
can
definitely
taste
all
the
flavors
advertised
i
am
just
of
the
opinion
that
its
not
very
well
done
the
coffee
is
definitely
there
as
is
the
lemon
peel
they
just
feel
fake
and
the
thinness
of
the
beer
does
not
help
the
cause
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
to
me
but
fun
to
try
if
you
are
sick
of
traditional
style
stoutsporters
o
a
very
interesting
beer
with
strong
black
coffee
roots
but
enough
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
to
keep
things
varied
and
interesting
a
touch
more
bitter
than
my
favorite
coffee
brews
it
still
works
well
and
offers
a
nice
contrast
to
other
stouts

being
the
strongest

with

definitely

but
i
think
it
turned
out
good
its
worth
trying
at

once
i
know
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
1
84
for
a
single
bottle
well
its
noon
so
about
time
to
try
a
breakfast
type
brew
and
this
has
espresso
in
the
name
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
waft
of
sweetness
of
malt
and
a
roasted
malts
pours
to
a
barely
tranlucent
motor
oil
with
a
three
fonger
multisize
bubble
tan
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
the
bitterness
of
coffee
upfront
with
the
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
solid
middle
of
a
nearly
balanced
cocoa
and
earthy
hops
finishing
with
a
slight
alcohol
twinge
and
a
fading
chaulky
bitter
finish
tasty
indeed
more
hop
twangy
than
i
expected
in
a
good
way
great
mouthfeel
a
spot
on
brew
for
brunch
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
coffee
tastes
burnt
to
me
the
slight
lemon
in
the
finish
is
quite
refreshing
though
purchase
value
a
i
was
able
to
secure
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
fantastic
price
of
1
99
which
is
well
worth
it
according
to
our
grading
matrix
a
sixpack
was
being
sold
for
just
under
10
00
which
is
a
steal
considering
the
quality
of
this
brew
o
awesome
beer
the
nose
could
use
some
work
imo
wow
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
brew
smooth
love
the
coffee
stout
taste
pours
dark
and
creamy
coffee
in
your
face
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
nice
and
delicious
overall
it
is
quite
a
good
beer
much
better
than
their
standard
2x
stout
i
would
get
it
again
overall
enjoyable
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
the
coffee
should
compliment
the
lactose
and
the
lemon
peel
should
compliment
the
coffee
too
much
acidity
from
the
coffee
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
just
wasnt
alot
of
coffee
to
this
one
not
heavy
enough
on
the
coffee
and
just
to
much
bite
the
coffee
flavor
is
off
semi
burnt
it
does
not
mix
well
with
what
little
chocolate
flavor
is
present
and
how
this
is
a
milk
stout
i
do
not
know
and
it
was
watery
and
not
very
sweet
i
cant
wait
until
a
little
later
today
when
i
will
have
another
of
these
enjoyable
a
nice
sweet
take
on
the
style
well
worth
a
go
o
much
different
from
your
typical
coffee
stout
i
wasnt
sure
if
truly
enjoyed
it
at
first
but
after
making
my
way
through
most
of
a
sixpack
this
is
a
great
beer
that
offers
a
different
approach
from
the
usual
o
this
is
a
good
coffee
stout
lots
of
strong
roasted
flavors
throughout
nice
beer
not
bad
but
not
awesome
would
drink
again
if
it
was
sitting
in
front
of
me
o
this
is
relatively
fresh
and
the
coffee
is
going
strong
nice
beer
not
really
a
milk
stout
more
a
regular
stout
great
nose
that
leads
to
an
equal
amount
of
coffee
nice
robust
loads
of
it
i
love
coffee
beers
but
most
just
dont
come
off
quite
right
this
is
pretty
much
what
you
want
out
of
one
i
dont
get
any
lemon
peels
though
looks
like
a
coffe
stout
smells
like
a
coffee
stout
and
tastes
like
a
coffee
stout
tastes
of
coffee
and
roasty
malts
very
little
sweetness
for
a
milk
stout
its
not
very
bitter
as
you
are
drinking
it
but
leaves
an
unpleasant
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
kinda
like
if
you
get
soap
mouth
bitter
the
lemon
peel
which
i
looked
for
and
looked
for
with
both
my
nose
and
my
taste
buds
is
so
well
hidden
that
i
only
knew
it
was
there
because
the
label
told
me
so
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
with
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
many
other
better
coffee
porters
and
stouts
out
there
deep
brownblack
into
the
snifter
literally
no
head
ive
seen
prettier
stouts
the
aromas
however
were
spot
on

bitter
and
roasty
coffee
nose
dark
roast
coffee
to
a
t
lemon
peel
check
as
advertised
i
love
bitter
this
beer
brings
the
bitter
big
time
nice
balance
between
roast
and
lemon
peel
coffee
nice
coating
mouthfeel
nailed
the
coffee
aspect
my
only
question
is
arent
2x
brews
supposed
to
be
doubleimperial
just
asking
excellent
brew
really
bitter
coffee
is
about
all
im
getting
here
didnt
detect
the
lemon
at
all
flavor
meh
very
lacking
no
pop
wheres
the
roast
malts
and
sweetness
heck
wheres
the
bitterness
from
the
coffee
or
esspresso
pretty
damn
bland
even
after
warming
for
a
good
half
hour
lame
yet
again
s
t
the
only
thing
you
do
consistantly
well
is
make
me
curious
and
let
me
down
hard
thanks
for
nothing
again
s
t
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
but
i
tried
it
at
the
brewery
it
was
drinkable
tasted
like
coffee
with
a
lemony
after
taste
good
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
overall
a
really
good
coffee
stout
big
roasty
taste
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
light
touch
of
lemon
o
a
very
nice
iteration
of
2xstout
with
plenty
of
coffee
and
extra
roastiness
far
from
an
imperial
stout
as
well
really
bringing
out
the
lactose
and
coffee
in
full
force
kinda
wish
this
was
yearround
along
with
the
regular
double
stout
12
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
on
12102014
pours
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
dense
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
around
the
glass
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
lemon
peel
caramel
toast
cream
light
char
light
herbal
and
roasted
earthiness
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted

coffee
lemon
peel
and
light
herbal
hop
notes
with
solid
strength
taste
of
milk

light

and
roasted

fair

notes
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
lemon
peel
caramel
toast
light
char
light
herbal
and
roasted

on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
complexity
robustness
and
balance
of
darkroasted

coffee
lemon
peel
and
light
herbal
hop
flavors
with
a
good

bitternesssweetness
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
smooth
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
stickychalky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
coffee
milk
stout
all
around
good
robustness
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
coffee
lemon
peel
and
light
herbal

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
my
favorite
beer
is
founders
breakfast
stout
so
i
tend
to
buy
any
stout
i
see
with
coffee
in
it
if
you
like
fbs
i
would
recommend
this
beer
strong
coffee
flavor
thick
and
syrupy
just
like
i
likes
mstouts
really
its
probably
the
closest
thing
ive
tried
to
fbs
that
wasnt
actually
fbs
which
is
nice
because
fbs
sold
out
incredibly
quickly
at
my
store
this
year
basically
saw
it
bought
it
came
back
two
weeks
later
and
they
were
already
out
this
beer
is
also
considerably
cheaper
since
it
comes
in
a
sixer
which
is
nice
though
its
also
a
mere
7
5
abv
which
may
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
the
situation
good
stuff
from
st
but
breakfast
stout
remains
my
go
to
coffee
beer
o
the
sweetness
of
it
eventually
overtakes
the
coffee
roast
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
its
very
drinkable
and
enticing
especially
to
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
overall
when
life
gives
you
lemons
make
lemon
coffee
beer
okay
admittedly
i
wasnt
fond
of
this
flavor
combination
this
is
one
instance
where
i
would
have
preferred
to
have
one
of
the
flavors
that
is
listed
on
a
beer
label
not
come
through
but
the
lemon
flavor
and
aroma
is
really
in
there
in
force
if
youre
the
type
of
person
who
thinks
do
you
know
what
would
go
good
with
coffee
lemonade
and
beer
then
this
one
is
for
you
for
a
coffee
stout
it
is
decent
with
the
flavor
combination
as
a
whole
i
would
not
buy
this
again
and
i
would
not
recommend
it
this
is
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
its
basically
mokah
lite
nice
brew
and
its
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
2x
series
in
my
opinion
recommended
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
most
milk
stouts
are
too
sweet
but
the
lemon
helped
cut
the
sweetness
very
good
coffee
milk
stout
smooth
and
creamy
the
citrus
is
not
overpowering
but
present
this
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
one
of
the
better
new
beers
from
southern
tier
lately
o
very
pleased
with
this
offering
from
southern
tier
not
a
big
fan
of
their
other
stout
offerings
im
not
sure
how
those
fans
will
respond
this
is
lighter
and
less
heavysweet
with
a
bright
lemon
character
to
lighten
the
stout
the
coffee
and
lemon
peel
got
to
be
very
acidic
gave
me
heartburn
tasty
beer
but
the
lemon
was
way
overpowered
by
the
coffee
as
the
fullishbodied
stout
trails
to
suggest
dryness
and
roasted
angles
another
type
of
bitterness
emerges
from
the
roast
and
is
gentle
of
grapefruit
orange
and
lemon
though
the
stout
celebrates
its
lemony
tone
in
its
description
its
actual
taste
is
hardly
more
than
it
achieved
by
pacific
northwest
hops
overall
this
is
an
interesting
concept
for
a
beer
and
overall
its
solid
however
with
all
of
the
phenomenal
coffee
stouts
out
there
i
probably
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
think
its
a
decent
example
of
a
coffee
stout
but
in
the
end
i
found
it
to
taste
more
like
regular
black
coffee
than
a
espresso
and
the
aroma
made
this
beer
rough
around
the
edges
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
a
little
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
would
be
my
limit
any
more
than
that
and
i
might
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
good
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
good
and
it
had
some
off
aspects
to
it
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
nice
to
try
once
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
feel
the
need
to
revisit
any
time
soon
if
you
really
like
coffee
stouts
it
might
be
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
standout
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
this
wasnt
bad
beer
but
in
the
end
i
just
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
it
and
i
found
the
off
aromas
to
be
a
little
surprising
its
not
a
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
its
not
a
favorite
for
the
style
either
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
and
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
bit
of
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
f
well
carbonated
despite
head
dissipation
rather
thin
feeling
though
comes
across
with
a
very
bright
flavor
a
slight
bit
of
booze
on
the
back
and
finishes
with
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
for
some
reason
i
also
got
a
slight
hint
of
pepper
but
maybe
that
was
just
the
alcohol
or
the
lemon
finish
easy
drinking
and
very
very
good
my
staple
brewery
hasnt
let
me
down
again
one
of
my
highest
ratings
ever
excellent
stout
huge
on
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
the
espresso
beans
very
forward
in
the
profile
not
subtle
i
loved
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
the
time
probably
my
new
favorite
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
coffee
colored
head
the
smell
is
full
of
coffee
and
espresso
beans
that
liven
the
palate
quite
easily
the
taste
is
very
rich
and
sweet
from
the
toasted
malt
giving
off
a
creamy
sweetness
of
dark
chocolate
and
then
a
rush
of
espresso
flavors
brightens
up
the
finish
it
was
heavy
in
mouthfeel
although
had
a
very
clean
aftertaste
would
definitely
try
again
and
hope
this
stays
around
pour
into
a
tulip
dark
mahogany
with
12
inch
head
that
laced
the
glass
nicely
sweet
nose
with
a
bitterish
coffee
finish
smooth
well
carbonated
tasty
the
taste
has
plenty
of
coffee
yet
still
enough
base
of
dry
roasted
malt
to
anchor
the
slight
bitter
flavors
with
mild
acidity
from
the
beans
and
light
earthy
flavor
it
is
really
a
coffeedominant
taste
wtih
slight
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
you
it
has
lemon
rind
in
it
except
for
the
label
but
perhaps
that
adds
to
some
of
the
bitterness
from
the
coffee
in
the
roast
flavor
that
lingers
overall
a
good
stout
with
lots
of
espresso
very
good
but
more
bitter
than
it
needs
to
be
somewhat
dry
for
the
style
and
medium
strength
extremely
good
very
balanced
the
espresso
comes
through
quite
mildly
fuller
at
warmer
temperatures
im
sure
would
be
more
pronounced
on
tap
the
lemon
peel
must
just
be
enough
to
stimulate
the
flavors
much
like
lemon
zest
in
cooking
so
dont
go
looking
for
or
get
put
off
by
the
prospect
of
coffee
lemonade
personally
i
would
like
a
more
intense
coffee
experience
nevertheless
another
superb
brew
from
southern
tier
flavor
reveals
roast
malt
and
coffee
slightly
acrid
and
bitter
with
raw
bean
notes
the
finish
is
harsh
sweet
lactose
saves
the
day
along
with
that
characteristic
chocolate
from
southern
tier
theres
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
wouldnt
have
picked
it
out
of
a
lineup
between
that
weird
chemicallike
flavor
im
subtly
getting
almost
nonstop
coffee
and
sharp
sweetness
im
left
with
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
some
coffee
heavy
beers
are
excellent
this
just
isnt
one
of
them
worth
a
try
but
thats
about
it
its
just
too
eh
with
too
much
of
a
threepacketsofsugarinablackcupofcoffee
vibe
this
is
a
very
good
beer
smells
of
malts
and
coffee
pours
dark
almost
black
delicious
very
happy
to
see
a
coffee
stout
offering
from
southern
tier
best
ive
had
since
sixpoints
3beans
a
couple
years
ago
the
aroma
along
with
the
taste
makes
this
beer
exceptional
they
accomplished
their
goal
and
the
beer
is
what
it
sounds
like
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
as
a
sipper
though
i
saw
that
this
was
going
to
be
sweet
but
i
wasnt
prepared
for
the
prominence
of
vanilla
they
really
hit
the
mark
on
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
but
its
definitely
a
novelty
type
beer
that
i
probably
wont
go
for
again
with
all
the
candy
and
chocolate
his
easter
morning
i
was
compelled
to
finally
open
this
and
satisfy
my
curiosity
just
too
sweet
and
intense
maybe
you
could
pour
some
over
vanilla
ice
cream
i
put
some
in
my
coffee
and
it
tastes
like
vanilla
creamer
but
theres
no
way
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
drink
much
more
than
a
shot
glass
at
one
sitting
first
half
is
amazing
second
half
just
turns
into
a
normal
stout
perhaps
not
for
the
traditionalist
but
as
a
dessert
offering
this
is
a
fine
selection
dont
try
and
pair
it
with
a
main
course
it
really
would
be
a
poor
match
also
if
you
dont
like
a
sweet
note
in
your
beer
then
this
would
be
one
to
avoid
heavy
stout
great
flavor
you
can
definitely
taste
the
vanilla
like
trying
to
drink
alcoholic
coffee
creamer
far
too
sweet
to
be
at
all
enjoyable
drainpour
again
i
find
milk
stouts
too
rich
for
me
it
seems
like
there
is
a
protein
element
present
that
is
off
putting
this
one
looks
great
and
the
body
is
nice
and
thick
the
nose
is
strong
butterscotch
which
would
be
quite
nice
if
it
were
toned
down
a
bit
its
just
too
sweet
and
strong
the
taste
is
similarly
overloaded
to
the
point
that
i
finds
self
just
trying
to
get
it
down
instead
of
spending
any
time
with
it
i
dont
want
to
knock
it
too
much
since
others
seem
to
be
high
on
it
just
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
this
family
is
not
for
me
the
ipa
drinkers
say
its
the
best
stout
theyve
ever
had
but
they
dont
know
what
the
fuck
a
good
dark
beer
tastes
like
overall
this
is
meant
to
share
with
friends
dont
serve
it
too
cold
have
it
as
dessert
mf
med
heavy
body
with
a
sweet
finish
3
would
be
perfect
if
the
high
alcohol
level
didnt
show
at
all
if
it
were
a
78
would
be
perfect
a
tad
too
sweet
and
rich
o
a
good
beer
i
sure
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
it
good
to
share
nice
couldnt
imbibe
a
lot
of
these
but
maybe
one
for
breakfast
or
dessert
nice
vanilla
and
chocolate
bitterness
on
the
back
end
strong
coffee
notes
and
the
promised
sweetness
and
vanilla
obviously
a
bit
on
the
dessert
side
good
and
not
just
for
what
it
is
although
youve
definitely
got
to
be
in
the
right
mood
as
far
as
imperial
milk
stouts
go
this
one
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
strong
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
complement
and
somewhat
tame
the
high
level
of
sweetness
although
this
is
one
of
the
sweetest
milk
stouts
i
have
had
it
is
not
overpowering
as
long
as
you
only
have
one
or
two
an
excellent
dessert
beer
very
hard
to
find
in
my
area
but
well
worth
the
search
quite
sweet
great
dessert
beer
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
beer
was
barely
palatable
to
me
very
artificial
tasting
and
very
cloying
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
certainly
my
favorite
milk
stout
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
delicious
buy
this
if
you
see
it
i
love
this
as
a
dessert
beer
yum
this
might
be
my
favorite
aromatic
beers
painfully
sweet
love
vanilla
but
not
like
this
had
this
beer
at
the
amazing
restaurant
in
bethlehem
called
corked
on
31015
my
wife
wanted
me
to
rate
this
beer
because
its
her
favorite
beer
ever
so
per
her
this
is
a
55
thin
taste
almost
feels
like
its
robbing
such
a
great
beer
with
such
a
thin
mouth
feel
poured
from
pint
and
a
half
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
little
less
than
room
temp
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
not
quite
black
very
minimal
head
probably
due
to
the
temp
smells
great
smells
of
vanilla
carmel
brown
sugar
malt
and
coffee
most
notable
is
the
carmel
to
me
tastes
good
at
first
like
vanilla
and
carmel
but
the
after
taste
is
very
alcoholic
and
medicinal
nearly
ruins
it
the
carbonation
is
slightly
less
than
what
i
prefer
and
it
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
overall
its
nothing
that
great
but
the
smell
is
remarkable
great
smell
nice
porter
taste
creme
brulee
taste
not
over
powering
sweet
and
delicious
not
a
drinker
i
love
this
stout
totally
worth
the
diabetes
this
beer
is
absolutely
horrible
the
smell
is
obnoxious
and
unappealing
the
taste
is
worse
it
has
one
of
the
worst
aftertastes
ive
ever
experienced
somewhat
medicinal
and
just
downright
nasty
the
beer
looks
good
however
its
opaque
almost
black
and
pours
a
nice
tan
one
finger
head
unfortunately
its
all
looks
and
no
taste
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
i
read
other
descriptions
and
i
guess
my
taste
buds
arent
refined
enough
because
i
didnt
taste
cocoa
chocolate
creme
brûlée
vanilla
or
anything
else
described
in
this
beer
its
horribly
sweet
and
unappealing
wont
be
buying
this
again
sweet
like
candy
but
with
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
that
kind
of
kills
the
beer
for
me
tastes
slightly
less
sweet
than
it
smells
but
both
smell
and
taste
are
very
sweet
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
making
it
a
one
12
pint
drinker
let
me
be
clear
i
enjoy
sweet
beers
but
this
one
was
a
bit
much
and
it
overpowered
the
good
flavour
profiles
nice
black
pour
into
the
glass
thin
wispy
head
very
potent
smell
of
caramel
and
vanilla
it
tastes
like
it
smells
with
the
caramel
really
shining
through
as
the
biggest
flavor
only
problem
is
it
takes
on
a
bubblegum
taste
as
it
warms
overall
i
really
like
it
and
will
get
it
again
nice
sweet
dessert
stout
great
as
an
after
dinner
drink
dark
black
body
no
head
lovely
vanilla
heavy
nose
smells
so
good
boozey
warming
and
some
vanilla
kinda
bitter
too
much
booze
decent
body
for
an
imperial
stout
smells
better
than
it
tastes
i
wanted
to
like
this
as
much
as
choklat
booze
killed
it
for
me
aggressive
pour
in
my
sniffer
glass
with
minimal
head
jet
black
vanilla
and
maybe
caramel
nose
bold
vanilla
and
pretty
sweet
full
body
would
have
liked
to
share
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
me
drinks
better
after
sitting
awhile
alcohol
well
hidden
definitely
a
dessert
beer
with
a
good
nose
but
the
splendafake
aftertaste
really
killed
this
beer
for
me
lots
of
vanilla
and
fairly
sweet
the
name
fits
definitely
good
for
dessert
good
very
sweet
make
for
a
perfect
after
dinner
drink
got
some
potently
to
it
way
too
sweet
for
me
i
was
shocked
how
much
this
reminded
me
of
artificial
sugar
and
fake
vanilla
this
was
the
first
large
format
that
i
didnt
continue
past
half
a
glass
one
word
vanilla
and
tons
of
it
way
too
much
vanilla
for
my
liking
an
excellent
imperial
milk
stout
the
name
is
spot
on
smell
is
of
all
caramel
and
delicious
the
taste
gives
more
roastiness
just
like
a
creme
brulee
this
stout
is
just
as
advertised
a
nice
dessert
this
beer
is
amazing
a
friend
bought
it
on
a
whim
since
he
enjoyed
creme
brulee
creamer
i
was
skeptical
until
i
smelled
ityoud
swear
it
was
a
cup
of
dessert
nicely
sweet
awesome
roast
not
boozy
this
is
a
panty
dropper
i
have
had
a
few
thousand
beers
in
my
day
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
as
my
second
favorite
beer
of
all
time
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beer
or
butterscotch
this
beer
isnt
for
you
i
am
a
stout
guy
by
the
way
and
i
like
sweet
stouts
but
any
sweeter
then
this
one
and
its
to
much
founders
big
luscious
for
example
is
to
sweet
but
this
one
is
on
the
mark
one
the
best
stouts
there
is
very
smooth
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
even
used
a
bottle
for
a
batch
of
ribs
on
did
in
the
crock
pot
that
gave
the
ribs
a
nice
sweet
note
to
them
that
even
carried
through
sometime
in
the
smoker
murky
dark
tootsie
roll
brown
with
khaki
head
toffee
and
caramel
candysugar
beet
notes
toffee
and
caramel
candy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
big
chewy
candy
tongue
coating
rich
sweet
malt
toffee
and
caramel
like
drinking
liquid
creme
brûlée
dessert
very
good
beer
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
vanilla
influence
very
sweet
at
first
but
the
slight
bitterness
really
mellows
it
out
very
nice
after
dinner
drink
nice
warm
feeling
from
the
alcohol
but
it
is
masked
very
well
nice
change
of
pass
wow
the
label
doe
not
lie
not
one
bit
this
is
dessert
in
a
glass
its
a
beautifully
dark
stout
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
that
laces
a
bit
at
the
beginning
the
aroma
well
creme
brulee
almost
says
it
all
it
smells
just
like
the
sweet
vanillacustardcaramelized
goodness
youd
order
as
a
desert
the
vanilla
bean
really
comes
across
in
the
nose
the
flavors
are
like
nose
but
more
hidden
behind
huge
sweetness
it
would
be
too
sweet
if
not
for
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
and
some
mild
alcohol
heat
the
full
bodied
mouth
feel
is
quite
surprising
at
first
because
of
the
thickness
but
its
very
creamy
and
smooth
glad
i
bought
this
at
9
5
abv
it
gets
even
better
as
it
goes
had
fakechemical
taste
i
love
st
but
really
disliked
the
taste
of
this
beer
wow
big
beer
delicious
sweet
vanilla
fresh
brewed
coffee
aroma
and
black
pour
with
virtually
no
head
super
rich
sweet
and
unfortunately
im
burdened
with
the
task
of
finishing
this
big
bottle
of
black
power
would
be
better
in
a
standard
strength
abv
offering
been
waiting
for
this
to
come
out
for
months
ive
been
warned
that
it
was
too
sweet
but
its
not
smells
wonderful
pours
a
beautiful
dark
color
and
tastes
even
better
overall
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
it
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
it
is
creamy
and
sweet
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
one
would
have
to
rank
it
in
its
own
category
for
what
it
is
a
delicious
stout
that
actually
tastes
like
creme
brule
its
very
close
to
perfect
way
to
sweet
for
my
liking
i
really
enjoyed
this
thinking
of
getting
a
growler
fillup
of
this
soon
seems
like
you
could
add
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
and
have
a
fine
dessert
lots
of
fans
of
this
beer
just
found
out
that
i
am
not
one
looks
great
with
a
pitch
black
body
and
ring
of
tan
head
served
good
and
cold
as
suggested
nose
was
exactly
like
a
werthers
original
candy
which
is
ok
by
me
could
barely
get
past
the
first
sip
hypersweet
astringest
horrible
mouthfeel
was
basically
a
guess
cant
do
it
wife
thinks
it
is
fine
if
it
wasnt
for
her
there
goes
an
8
99
drain
pour
bottom
of
the
barrel
for
me
i
am
a
stout
guy
and
this
hit
way
off
the
mark
for
me
liquified
cookie
dough
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
wifey
likes
it
so
easy
to
split
a
bomber
thanks
to
the
traders
who
helped
me
get
both
13
and
14
editions
poured
from
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
bornon
date
of
7122013
and
tasted
1112015
pours
dark
as
a
good
stout
should
but
almost
nonexistent
head
despite
aggressive
pour
scent
is
wonderful
pronounced
sweetness
of
vanilla
caramel
burnt
sugars
to
be
honest
it
not
only
smells
but
tastes
remarkably
like
baileys
irish
cream
just
minus
the
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
as
with
all
other
flavorspecific
beers
ive
had
from
southern
tier
it
pretty
much
nails
creme
brulee
in
flavor
im
really
enjoying
the
finish
of
caramelized
sugar
feel
is
not
quite
fullbodied
nicely
carbonated
and
not
nearly
as
astringent
as
youd
expect
from
an
imperial
this
is
a
delicious
milk
stout
that
i
would
highly
recommend
for
dessert
well
done
overall
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
and
im
not
totally
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
its
not
as
cloying
as
i
was
expecting
and
is
actually
fairly
wellbalanced
its
been
years
since
ive
tasted
this
fresh
so
perhaps
the
age
helps
tone
it
down
some
either
way
a
unique
beer
worth
a
shot
even
if
not
one
of
my
favorites
v
bought
in
a
single
bomber
worth
it
at
any
price
is
say
this
was
my
first
southern
tier
i
cant
believe
how
close
they
got
this
to
tasting
like
actual
creme
brulee
excellent
very
tasty
flavorful
and
changes
as
you
let
it
warm
up
awesome
totally
unique
decadent
dessert
beer
money
baby
served
on
tap
year
round
at
a
bar
back
home
not
overly
sweet
on
taste
in
my
opinion
and
the
smell
always
makes
me
feel
good
thats
when
i
know
im
home
first
beer
i
ever
had
at
a
bar
so
maybe
im
a
bit
biased
but
it
will
always
be
my
favorite
very
thick
and
very
dark
but
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
which
is
why
i
docked
a
bit
on
look
alcohol
doesnt
overpower
the
variety
of
flavors
which
is
impressive
for
a
beer
that
is
almost
10
maybe
not
for
everyone
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
ever
find
it
this
was
a
very
sweet
stout
and
best
served
with
a
similar
desert
heavy
on
vanilla
overall
pretty
good
im
completely
enamored
with
the
smell
of
this
beer
alone
this
is
the
best
milk
stout
you
will
ever
drink
once
you
try
it
you
are
hooked
i
think
last
season
myself
and
wife
bought
a
case
ourselves
such
a
sweet
stout
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
taste
but
by
god
is
it
cloying
dessert
in
a
glass
good
pour
good
head
rich
and
dark
very
tasty
on
the
early
winter
months
t
it
has
sweetness
but
also
bitterness
and
some
earthy
roast
going
on
a
lot
of
vanilla
bean
on
back
so
much
it
has
an
herbal
bitter
aftertaste
i
love
the
vanilla
notes
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
gives
stouts
so
id
be
a
hypocrite
to
say
i
dont
like
this
beer
i
love
it
but
it
is
awfully
sweet
its
for
dessert
interesting
beer
overall
exceptional
this
has
instantly
become
a
favorite
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
perfect
as
a
dessert
beer
yes
it
is
pretty
sweet
but
thats
what
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
very
well
done
southern
tier
a
very
good
specialty
beer
good
with
dessert
i
had
it
with
cheese
and
light
fruit
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
overall
its
delicious
and
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
but
not
the
be
all
end
all
of
milk
stouts
this
is
plenty
sweet
on
its
own
to
stand
up
to
the
rigors
of
home
made
ice
cream
what
a
great
float
tasted
like
chocolate
cake
i
will
buy
this
again
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
had
this
and
have
not
found
it
locally
again
o
3
50
this
is
an
unorthodox
brew
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
polarizing
with
some
people
loving
it
and
some
hating
it
it
is
really
sweet
and
candylike
and
that
might
not
be
your
thing
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
offering
to
mix
things
up
a
bit
i
could
not
drink
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
so
much
sugar
that
it
is
not
drinkable
sickly
sweet
i
couldnt
get
past
a
few
sips
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
was
just
too
much
for
me
maybe
ill
revisit
and
bake
with
it
some
time
fantastic
very
sweet
and
good
for
dessert
much
to
my
surprise
i
really
liked
this
first
beer
i
ever
had
that
truly
fit
into
a
desert
beer
category
unique
experience
excellent
if
you
like
the
sweet
taste
no
trace
of
alcohol
at
all
overall
it
is
a
very
good
desert
beer
intense
creme
brulee
taste
completely
takes
over
the
palate
very
rich
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
heat
despite
its
9
6
abv
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
pretty
damn
good
it
pours
a
deep
black
there
is
a
strong
sweet
taste
of
vanilla
and
caramel
the
nose
is
strong
you
could
basically
have
this
thing
for
dessert
i
dont
know
how
great
it
would
be
with
normal
foods
heavy
alcohol
content
heavy
stout
on
tap
at
the
brewery
itself
delicious
pours
dark
black
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
cream
and
vanilla
the
taste
changes
when
drank
from
the
bottle
starting
off
soft
and
sweet
and
then
getting
more
boozy
as
you
drink
through
the
bottle
thick
mouthfeel
which
is
always
good
for
a
sweet
stout
thought
it
was
very
good
poured
black
as
night
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
texture
was
full
bodied
very
thick
nit
as
much
creamy
as
oily
taste
is
dominated
by
the
vanilla
though
other
malt
flavors
such
as
coffee
and
molasses
linger
there
as
well
very
sweet
was
interesting
to
try
but
would
not
buy
it
again
o
i
like
a
glass
or
two
of
this
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
it
because
of
the
sweetness
i
can
understand
that
it
isnt
everyones
cup
of
tea
given
the
almost
single
note
of
vanilla
and
being
so
sweet
o
no
dont
drink
this
beer
this
may
not
be
anyones
favorite
stout
but
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
when
you
buy
this
and
it
absolutely
delivers
pretty
darned
sweet
to
tackle
a
bomber
in
one
tasting
captured
in
my
glass
are
a
classic
though
light
stout
with
high
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
nothing
slaps
your
face
except
the
uniqueness
and
as
martha
stewart
used
to
say
thats
a
good
thing
about
as
miraculous
a
dessert
beer
as
you
could
dream
of
sweet
delicious
yet
without
being
bogged
down
in
its
own
self
satisfaction
slight
edge
to
keep
you
drinking
as
if
more
enticements
were
needed
a
great
beer
for
after
dinner
the
one
draw
back
is
that
the
24
oz
bottle
of
this
stuff
is
a
little
too
much
you
pretty
much
have
to
split
it
with
someone
if
it
is
available
in
a
12
oz
bottle
i
would
get
that
to
start
other
than
that
it
has
a
very
sweet
taste
with
caramel
and
vanilla
being
prominent
o
very
good
dessert
beer
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
more
on
the
lines
of
a
mix
drink
than
a
beer
very
unique
though
this
is
a
unique
beer
its
a
sweet
stout
that
smells
and
tastes
like
youre
dining
on
an
actual
crème
brulee
the
aroma
is
overwhelming
with
vanilla
and
caramel
the
taste
follows
the
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
slightly
viscous
with
low
carbonation
you
can
skip
ordering
dessert
and
just
have
some
of
this
instead
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
after
a
fine
meal
it
would
perfectly
hit
the
spot
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
a
real
eye
opener
turns
out
pretty
dang
good
you
wont
be
pounding
this
brew
as
both
the
heavy
creamyness
as
well
as
the
high
abv
content
make
that
a
bad
idea
but
as
an
evening
sipper
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
desert
in
a
glass
this
is
almost
too
sweet
but
glorious
at
the
same
time
definitely
a
desert
or
after
dinner
drink
not
something
you
will
drink
fast
or
plenty
of
the
pour
is
nice
and
dark
plenty
of
sweet
aromas
coming
out
of
the
glass
the
taste
is
phenomenal
the
sweetness
and
warmth
of
the
alcohol
go
really
well
together
not
much
more
i
can
say
about
this
beer
other
than
the
fact
that
they
nailed
it
perfect
for
what
it
is
overall
okay
so
which
camp
do
i
fall
into
well
i
do
find
the
flavors
interesting
and
i
definitely
pick
up
the
creme
brulee
flavors
but
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
one
again
this
gets
a
3
71
from
me
as
i
understand
and
appreciate
the
brewers
intentions
but
this
is
something
to
have
as
a
desert
beer
during
the
holidays
with
34
guests
getting
about
a
6oz
pour
i
will
finish
this
bomber
myself
but
i
will
also
return
my
glass
to
the
freezer
a
few
times
to
keep
the
temp
down
it
is
still
a
fiercely
sweet
stout
there
are
some
nice
roasted
and
charred
sugar
flavors
here
but
the
sweetness
seems
to
intensify
with
each
sip
and
becomes
a
bit
of
a
chore
after
half
the
bomber
and
the
alcohol
becomes
hot
making
the
roast
and
char
flavors
become
almost
astringent
i
love
a
subtle
sweetness
that
just
balances
but
this
is
the
opposite
i
find
my
palate
desperately
searching
out
and
clinging
to
the
roasted
flavors
and
the
dried
vanilla
bean
but
the
next
sip
just
coats
everything
with
another
layer
of
sweet
vanilla
custard
so
while
my
grade
is
generous
and
understanding
of
the
flavors
i
will
now
officially
join
the
camp
that
will
never
purchase
this
beer
again
but
i
will
not
bash
it
as
some
members
of
this
camp
are
apt
to
do
try
this
if
you
must
but
i
strongly
recommend
oat
and
choklat
they
are
excellent
vanilla
bean
character
dominates
this
beer
both
in
smell
and
taste
its
got
more
on
the
nose
than
it
does
on
the
flavor
pallet
though
the
first
time
i
had
this
deliciousness
was
out
of
the
tap
back
in
2010
the
fragrant
aroma
poured
from
the
glass
as
three
of
us
just
stood
over
the
pint
drooling
in
disbelief
over
the
years
the
creme
brulee
has
some
times
shown
to
be
a
bit
artifical
and
chalky
tasting
the
mouthfeel
has
also
varied
from
delightfully
medium
to
syrupy
heavy
i
dont
think
nothing
will
ever
compare
to
that
first
meeting
but
all
in
all
its
a
delighful
beer
overall
definitely
a
nice
onceinawhile
dessert
treat
not
something
to
be
had
every
day
but
like
with
a
delicious
rich
sweet
dessert
something
to
savor
every
now
and
then
worth
trying
but
dont
walk
a
mile
for
it
o
too
fizzy
to
start
i
actually
let
it
open
up
in
the
refrigerator
for
a
couple
hours
and
it
was
much
better
but
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
dessert
beer
it
was
pretty
sweet
but
not
anywhere
near
as
bad
as
people
on
this
site
make
it
seem
this
stout
drinks
well
for
being
almost
10
percent
but
it
needs
more
malts
or
alcohol
to
cut
the
sweetness
not
my
favorite
of
the
southern
tier
stouts
poured
the
stout
into
a
snifter
glass
and
an
offwhite
tan
colored
head
did
form
but
quickly
retreated
to
a
slight
layer
along
the
top
first
aroma
and
most
pronounced
is
the
vanilla
if
there
is
any
others
im
not
getting
them
well
i
guess
the
milkcream
aspect
is
quite
prevalent
too
tastes
like
a
very
sweet
vanilla
creme
brulee
as
it
should
the
carbonation
is
quite
decent
for
a
stout
and
the
smooth
creamy
texture
is
pleasant
as
it
finishes
warming
from
the
alcohol
is
a
yes
and
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
considering
all
you
taste
is
sugar
sweetness
in
the
end
this
was
a
delight
to
drink
though
i
only
could
do
half
the
22oz
cause
it
was
so
rich
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
but
the
highlevel
sweetness
is
probably
not
for
everyone
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
7202013
o
when
southern
tier
labels
this
as
a
sweet
stout
they
truly
took
this
to
heart
this
brew
is
very
sweet
but
i
think
the
intent
was
executed
perfectly
the
fact
that
the
smell
truly
eludes
to
the
taste
is
wonderful
the
mouthfeel
being
as
creamy
as
it
is
is
also
wonderful
i
think
the
only
thing
this
could
benefit
from
is
being
a
tad
less
sweet
but
honestly
it
works
well
ive
had
creme
brulee
once
and
this
is
most
certainly
it
in
liquid
form
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
black
with
a
very
thick
head
great
lacing
smells
like
creme
brulee
and
tastes
like
creme
brulee
nice
and
sweet
thick
and
creamy
most
beers
that
advertise
as
being
sweet
are
not
but
this
one
definitely
delivers
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
but
gives
you
a
nice
kick
a
very
good
desert
beer
dark
creamy
vanilla
smooth
heavy
body
however
still
refreshing
caramel
malts
vanilla
bean
similar
to
some
cream
ales
tasted
recently
i
e
cali
creamin
mother
earth
only
its
a
stout
very
friendly
desert
thank
you
probably
the
best
beer
to
have
with
vanilla
icecream
gonna
go
buy
another
22
oz
just
for
that
probably
a
good
candidate
for
the
cellar
program
cheers
yall
o
im
sorry
but
i
just
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
southern
tier
has
some
other
excellent
brews
but
this
they
really
out
thought
themselves
o
out
of
all
of
sts
blackwater
stuff
this
is
by
far
the
richest
and
all
of
them
are
equally
good
dessert
beers
but
this
one
is
just
really
awesome
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
because
im
such
a
fan
of
the
dessert
but
i
didnt
have
very
high
hopes
for
it
i
figured
it
would
be
too
sweet
or
like
melted
ice
cream
with
a
bit
of
a
malt
taste
to
it
the
balance
of
the
beer
really
struck
me
it
was
beerfirst
though
by
no
means
was
the
cremebrulee
a
minor
flavor
it
didnt
taste
fake
like
some
chocolate
stouts
or
gimmicky
like
voodoo
doughnut
it
just
tasted
like
a
better
than
average
stout
with
some
very
naturaltasting
flavors
added
in
it
would
make
the
perfect
dessert
beer
but
really
its
not
so
sweet
that
it
couldnt
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
ill
likely
buy
again
black

with
a
healthy
dark

foam
that
slowly
dissipated
intensely
sweet
vanilla
aroma
with
mocha
butterscotch
dark
caramel
and
cream
in
tow
boozy
notes
also
begin
to
peek
through
as
this
warmed
this
honestly
smelled
like
a
pastry
maybe
tiaramasu
incredibly
smooth
slightly
thick
feel
with
rich
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
a
milky
stickiness
at
the
end
creamy
sweet
vanilla
flavor
up
front
that
slowly
tapers
as
a
tangy
bitter
hop
bite
rides
overtop
charred
malt
flavor
beneath
that
slowly
intensifies
to
the
finish
accompanied
by
smooth
vanilla
the
feel
and
candylike
sweetness
is
reminiscent
of
pumking
overall
smells
sweet
tastes
sweet
and
is
still
sweet
i
like
it
but
the
sweetness
could
be
a
bit
overbearing
for
most
still
an
enjoyable
beer
though
o
its
sweet
but
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
drinking
12oz
loved
the
aroma
unlike
anything
ive
experienced
base
stout
was
mostly
sweet
the
butterscotch
aftertaste
was
what
made
this
one
a
winner
great
beer
this
was
unique
and
kind
of
amazing
that
said
the
sweetness
limits
the
overall
drinkability
worth
a
try
if
it
appeals
to
you
owhat
a
digestif
top
shelf
milk
stout
southern
tier
makes
the
literal
sweetest
brews
around
enough
hops
as
well
to
cut
against
the
super
sugar
blasts
make
crème
brulee
a
bittersweet
treat
anyone
who
doesnt
like
sweet
desserts
wont
like
this
beer
that
being
said
i
thought
it
was
delicious
the
vanilla
character
is
so
powerful
its
mind
blowing
id
have
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
but
its
also
necessary
to
share
overall
goes
together
well
with
desserts
like
pudding
and
ice
cream
but
still
too
sweet
for
my
taste
its
nice
to
try
unusual
brews
every
once
and
awhile
but
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
anymore
overall
hands
down
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
when
im
out
and
see
bombers
sold
separate
i
pick
one
or
two
up
despite
how
much
i
like
it
i
cant
bring
myself
to
buy
a
case
price
probably
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
many
people
think
beer
is
just
beer
but
this
is
one
of
the
craft
brew
scenes
beers
that
could
make
them
think
otherwise
make
people
realize
theres
more
to
beer
than
the
handful
of
light
beers
served
everywhere
dark
brown
in
color
average
carbonation
in
the
glass
and
in
the
mouth
some
sharp
notes
which
we
may
thank
the
carbonation
for
bitter
aftertaste
adds
to
the
confusion
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
overall
the
ultimate
dessert
beer
im
not
even
sure
if
i
can
finish
this
entire
bottle
its
so
rich
i
can
see
why
theyd
want
you
to
pair
this
with
vanilla
ice
cream
heck
even
a
bit
of
milk
might
go
along
way
i
cannot
underestimate
how
rich
this
beer
is
five
ounces
in
and
i
think
i
just
developed
diabetes
amazing
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
id
want
to
drink
on
any
sort
of
consistent
basis
i
decided
to
crack
this
with
my
breakfast
in
place
of
coffee
today
and
am
quite
glad
i
did
this
stout
pours
an
almost
black
mahogany
color
with
almost
no
head
and
very
little
silky
lacing
the
nose
is
delicious
butterscotch
vanilla
coffee
and
just
a
little
booze
it
is
actually
one
of
the
most
satisfying
smelling
beers
that
ive
ever
had
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
unfortunately
the
butterscotch
flavor
overpowers
the
coffee
flavor
that
would
of
perfectly
balanced
this
stout
it
is
still
very
tasty
and
satisfying
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
sticky
but
this
is
actually
a
good
thing
because
the
lingering
flavors
of
butterscotch
and
the
small
amount
of
coffee
that
lives
just
in
the
tail
this
was
great
with
breakfast
but
would
be
equally
awesome
with
or
even
as
dessert
an
interesting
take
on
milk
stout
a
sweet
dessert
drink
with
a
light
alcohol
kick
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
snifter
with
a
deep
brownblack
with
some
transparency
around
the
edges
and
a
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
true
to
its
namesake
with
a
powerful
scent
of
burnt
caramel
taste
very
much
mirrors
the
nose
with
a
burnt
caramel
taste
dominating
hints
of
vanilla
and
sugary
fruit
come
through
has
it
warms
up
a
bit
nice
consistency
in
the
mouth
leaving
a
sweet
caramel
coating
behind
i
enjoyed
it
truly
a
desert
beer
as
its
name
indicates
o
i
must
say
this
is
a
decent
desert
beer
in
small
quantities
i
almost
feel
like
i
need
to
go
run
several
miles
to
deal
with
the
guilt
of
having
drank
what
amounts
to
basically
a
creme
brulee
watered
down
with
alcohol
i
would
drink
it
again
if
a
friend
offered
after
dinner
looks
decent
upon
first
pour
rather
thin
looking
but
still
very
dark
and
black
smell
is
actually
very
good
smells
like
a
small
batch
cake
batter
spiked
with
booze
infused
butterscotch
super
sugary
and
sweet
taste
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
nose
and
was
somewhat
sad
great
smell
mediocre
taste
the
smell
lives
up
to
the
name
sake
100
fold
the
smell
of
butterscotch
punches
you
in
the
face
it
is
so
pungent
that
it
overwhelms
you
it
smells
like
desert
you
get
hints
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
but
that
is
masked
by
the
overwhelming
sweetness
of
the
smell
the
pour
is
solid
black
but
the
froth
and
the
head
lack
the
beer
needs
carbonation
the
taste
fails
to
deliver
on
the
smell
it
lacks
viscosity
and
for
a
beer
at
9
6
abv
it
does
not
have
the
mouthfeel
you
would
desire
the
finish
is
poor
leaving
you
with
a
chalking
and
uncomfortable
aftermath
of
blah
o
pretty
damn
good
head
could
last
a
bit
longer
heat
could
be
a
bit
more
mild
nose
reeks
of
vanilla
as
advertised
it
doesnt
pretend
to
follow
the
style
exactly
and
it
delivers
some
great
aspects
with
a
basis
in
the
big
milk
stout
i
like
it
muchly
i
cant
say
anything
about
the
flavors
in
this
ale
that
havent
been
said
before
all
i
can
add
is
my
general
impression
that
i
have
died
and
gone
to
ale
heaven
tomorrow
i
make
an
aleice
cream
float
while
it
is
a
dessert
ale
it
also
works
well
with
burgers
and
sweet
potato
fried
mouth
feel
is
just
as
creamy
as
it
should
be
nice
and
thick
smooth
alcohol
is
well
hidden
bravo
o
3
75
its
a
good
beer
and
is
what
it
is
but
i
feel
like
somethings
missing
to
push
it
to
the
9294
level
more
complexity
the
flavors
are
a
bit
cloying
for
a
dessert
beer
this
one
is
near
the
top
its
a
smokey
butterscotch
and
vanilla
bean
offering
that
masks
the
ac
well
drinks
like
a
6
5
or
7
stout
if
i
had
to
summarize
the
experience
i
would
say
that
drinking
this
beer
was
like
smoking
a
sweet
quality
cigar
that
had
been
dipped
in
vanilla
served
at
the
brewers
kettle
in
high
point
this
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
black
with
about
one
finger
of
light
tan
creamy
head
minimal
head
retention
but
a
little
lacing
all
the
same
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
strongly
vanilla
for
me
its
almost
too
sweet
the
taste
closely
matches
the
aroma
and
i
was
wishing
for
more
stout
and
less
vanilla
the
vanilla
is
almost
too
much
and
overpowers
the
subtle
milk
stout
it
has
a
nice
feeling
in
the
palate
from
the
lactose
overall
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
i
wish
the
bottle
notes
had
more
prominently
highlighted
that
this
was
strictly
a
dessert
beer
as
a
dessert
beer
this
is
fabulous
as
it
has
the
smell
taste
and
feel
of
an
after
dinner
drink
this
is
much
better
served
over
50f
as
straight
out
of
the
fridge
restricts
some
of
the
flavor
i
cannot
say
enough
about
the
smell
of
this
beer
they
should
make
scented
candles
out
of
it
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
higher
score
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
on
its
own
for
me
however
if
you
mix
it
with
a
coffee
style
stout
its
unbelievable
like
starbucks
made
a
beer
i
will
absolutely
buy
this
and
serve
it
as
a
dessert
beer
or
to
mix
with
various
stouts
or
porters
and
fyi
i
think
the
ladies
with
a
sweet
tooth
would
love
this
one
too
especially
the
ones
who
say
they
dont
like

this
is

balance
and
extremely

to

on
for
the
big
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
sm
a
lover
of
the
thick
sweet
and
dark
beers
more
thzn
the
hoppy
ones
as
a
note
the
high
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
is
well
hidden
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
dark
brown
color
no
head
has
an
amazingly
sweet
vanilla
sugar
and
caramel
aroma
taste
is
the
same
sweet
vanilla
but
also
has
a
bitterness
that
prevents
it
from
being
too
sweet
i
cant
help
wish
this
was
a
pure
sweet
stout
but
maybe
it
would
have
been
too
rich
has
a
full
body
feel
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
seems
this
is
best
served
slightly
colder
than
most
stoutsthe
flavors
are
strong
enough
to
come
through
at
a
lower
temp
as
it
warms
the
vanilla
can
be
a
bit
syrupy
and
cloying
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
much
more
so
than
st
choklat
but
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
10
oz
or
so
as
the
sweetness
is
best
in
moderation
i
brought
it
to
a
dinner
party
to
share
as
a
dessert
beer
and
it
served
that
purpose
admirably
overall
excellent
for
those
who
love
dessert
beers
i
really
appreciated
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
picking
it
up
on
occasion
this
makes
me
really
want
to
try
their
choklat
offering
as
the
only
others
ive
had
by
them
is
warlock
and
pumking
id
heard
various
things
about
this
beer
from
outrageously
bad
to
overwhelmingly
good
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
for
myself
this
does
taste
a
good
deal
like
its
namesake
but
not
so
much
that
you
forget
its
a
beer
the
9
5
is
a
bit
sneaky
and
since
it
only
comes
in
a
bomber
id
recommend
sharing
very
well
done
and
worth
seeking
out
in
the
late
winter
early
spring
on
tap
at
beer
run
in
cville
obsidian
in
color
with
a
micro
lace
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
what
a
nose
its
like
getting
punched
in
the
face
by
the
candy
man
wearing
butterscotch
boxing
gloves
taste
follows
the
nose
but
relatively
toned
down
smooth
sweet
lingering
on
the
back
in
a
way
that
stays
with
you
but
is
nice
bis
thick
and
uniform
poured
inky
black
into
pint
glass
with
small
toffee
colored
head
aroma
is
coffee
and
creme
brulee
go
figure
taste
up
front
is
bitter
coffee
that
becomes
very
sweet
sugariness
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
feels
a
little
thin
very
delicious
beer
if
you
can
stomach
the
sweetness
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
the
smell
is
ridiculously
good
as
noted
before
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
with
some
vanilla
icecream
or
some
sort
of
desert
the
only
negative
is
that
it
becomes
too
sweet
towards
the
end
although
my
opinion
isnt
raving
its
definitely
worth
the
powerful
punch
of
intense
flavors
o
the
amount
of
vanillabutterscotch
in
this
took
me
by
pleasant
surprise
i
was
hoping
for
more
roasted
coffeechocolate
and
a
bit
more
thickness
but
overall
the
beer
to
me
is
very
balanced
and
definitely
something
to
seek
out
again
o
i
was
surprised
how
big
the
vanilla
was
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
drinkable
dessert
beer
this
is
one
to
lookout
for
wish
maybe
it
was
more
roasty
that
vanilla
but
still
a
great
beer
overall
creme
brulee
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
by
southern
tier
the
familiar
qualities
creme
brulee
mix
well
with
the
typical
stout
characteristics
to
make
a
very
enjoyable
beer
while
not
an
everyday
drinker
its
enjoyable
to
break
one
out
while
in
season
should
be
pretty
easy
to
find
and
at
the
price
of
8
99
per
bottle
its
tempting
to
pick
one
or
two
up
on
each
release
overall
pretty
nice
milk
stout
but
could
not
finish
the
entire
bomber
by
myself
it
tastes
like
a
creme
brulee
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
the
dessert
i
am
then
youll
love
this
beer
would
love
to
pair
this
with
a
carmelized
banana
dessert
as
southern
tier
suggests
overall
i
can
see
this
beer
as
not
being
for
everybody
it
is
enormously
sweet
and
absolutely
crazy
perhaps
that
is
why
i
like
it
hands
down
amazing
not
my
typical
kind
of
beer
but
my
sister
brought
it
over
one
night
i
was
stunned
stunned
ill
have
to
review
in
more
depth
when
i
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
the
beer
store
by
us
says
theyll
have
it
sometime
this
month
its
like
waiting
for
christmas
overall
this
beer
is
deliciously
sweet
and
satisfies
all
of
my
senses
i
would
100
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
even
thinking
about
trying
it
it
will
be
going
down
as
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
well
i
am
really
mad
at
myself
for
cracking
this
by
myself
if
i
somehow
get
through
the
whole
bottle
i
wont
sleep
for
weeks
but
at
least
ill
probably
go
for
a
5
mile
walk
or
clean
the
garage
as
ill
be
so
hyped
on
sugar
hmmmm
maybe
my
brazilian
wife
will
like
it
since
its
so
sweet
let
me
see
her
consensus
not
too
sweet
not
surprisingly
as
she
drinks
ice
wine
and
puts
more
than
a
14
cup
of
sugar
in
one
cup
of
coffee
just
a
bit
too
boozy
and
the
espresso
flavor
is
too
much
guess
she
wont
be
helping
me
finish
it
im
on
my
own
too
late
to
call
in
reinforcements
i
guess
ill
just
cut
it
with
lots
of
snacks
and
try
to
work
my
way
through
it
serving
type
22oz
bottle
poured
into
snifter
love
this
beer
but
be
warned
you
can
only
drink
in
small
doses
you
wont
be
able
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
of
this
pour
a
glass
and
sip
for
an
hour
or
two
type
of
beer
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
light
medium
brown
head
the
taste
is
very
sweet
much
sweeter
than
your
typical
milk
stout
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
place
with
an
amazing
selection
of
micros
appearance
is
very
dark
which
i
was
not
expecting
the
smell
is
amazing
truly
smells
like
crete
brûlée
which
was
a
pleasure
the
taste
was
very
good
and
more
surprising
since
some
beers
smell
like
the
targeted
goal
but
taste
does
not
always
follow
definitely
a
dessert
beer
so
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
too
much
of
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pleasant
my
girlfriend
bought
a
bottle
and
we
plan
to
drink
it
tonight
read
another
review
in
which
they
mixed
it
with
southern
tiers
pumpking
i
happen
to
have
two
22oz
bottles
of
that
so
i
will
try
that
as
well
very
good
beer
in
small
doses
highly
recommend
at
least
a
try
i
highly
recommend
this
one
appearance
if
it
appears
in
my
glass
im
happy
poured
black
with
some
dark
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
no
head
just
some
stray
bubbles
here
and
there
on
the
surface
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
right
off
the
bat
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
duncan
hinse
yellow
cake
mix
being
poured
into
a
pan
and
baking
which
for
me
is
fantastic
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
but
then
turns
sour
and
bitter
like
pure
vanilla
without
any
sugar
faint
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
the
bitter
and
sour
flavors
do
linger
like
chewing
on
a
hunk
of
bakers
chocolate
the
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
and
it
warms
very
well
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
a
local
restaurant
is
serving
floats
made
with
the
creme
brulee
stout
and
vanilla
ice
cream
i
have
yet
to
try
it
but
look
forward
to
doing
so
in
the
near
future
pours
a
deep
pitch
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
incredible
smells
like
sugar
and
vanilla
just
like
a
creme
brulee
taste
follows
suit
there
is
a
deep
rich
oak
like
character
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
tastes
very
much
like
caramelized
sugar
and
cream
low
carbonation
very
viscous
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
milk
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
overall
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
it
tastes
amazing
at
first
but
it
is
difficult
to
drink
more
than
4
oz
of
t
his
beer
it
is
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
yourself
definitely
a
beer
to
share
with
others
pair
it
with
vanilla
ice
cream
o
delivers
on
the
name
but
becomes
cloying
after
awhile
unique
flavor
combination
in
my
experience
but
not
necessarily
one
i
care
to
have
again
bitterness
offset
the
malt
sweetness
too
much
for
me
to
consider
this
a
good
dessert
brew
my
wife
and
two
grown
daughters
agreed
one
poured
some
over
vanilla
ice
cream
and
found
the
net
taste
still
unpleasantly
bitter
overall
not
going
to
be
everybodys
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
an
amazing
dessert
beer
super
sweet
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
cant
drink
a
ton
which
is
why
finding
it
on
tap
is
good
its
not
bad
but
would
be
much
better
split
with
a
few
friends
this
rating
would
have
been
lower
if
not
for
the
redeeming
quality
it
has
when
mixed
with
southern
tiers
pumpking
as
for
the
creme
brulee
on
its
own22
ounces
is
just
too
much
for
it
to
be
enjoyable
what
i
mean
by
that
is
the
first
few
sips
seem
good
enough
you
get
the
sweetness
and
the
taste
of
creme
brulee
then
the
alcohol
flavor
hits
and
keeps
hitting
by
the
time
you
get
halfway
through
the
22
ouncer
which
it
is
only
sold
in
it
is
just
overpowering
and
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
harsh
amazingly
however
when
mixed
with
southern
tiers
pumpkingalso
available
only
in
22
ounces
it
becomes
what
is
known
as
a
creamy
pumpkin
and
it
is
outstanding
one
of
the
best
beer
mixes
i
have
had
to
be
honest
but
unfortunately
for
the
creme
brulee
i
am
rating
it
mostly
on
its
own
merrit
which
is
subpar
at
best
very
good
overall
its
an
unapologetic
dessert
beer
with
some
complexity
id
have
it
again
without
hesitation
just
opened
a
2010
bottle
and
have
to
totally
disagree
with
the
cellaring
recommendation
wish
i
would
have
waited
longer
this
beer
is
extraordinary
has
mellowed
a
bit
since
2010
all
for
the
better
just
glad
i
still
have
one
bottle
of
this
vintage
in
the
cellar
three
years
is
definitely
not
too
long
to
cellar
oone
of
my
most
favorite
stouts
heavy
on
the
malt
light
on
the
hops
smells
fantastic
and
gets
you
a
good
buzz
without
feeling
horrible
when
your
done
especially
because
the
bottle
is
so
large
this
could
definitely
be
a
stuck
on
a
desert
island
beer
for
me
o
vanilla
is
the
word
o
a
vanilla
bean
bomb
the
way
people
talk
about
this
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
concoction
and
it
wasnt
the
taste
is
also
as
vanilla
bean
forward
as
the
aroma
but
there
is
an
obvious
sweetness
and
a
slight
bitterness
hailing
from
behind
worth
a
high
grade
overall
people
told
me
this
was
sickeningly
sweet
and
it
not
as
bad
as
i
anticipated
in
the
sweetness
category
but
its
close
the
sweetness
is
an
interesting
flavor
but
maybe
a
little
too
much
overall
its
too
sweet
without
darkness
or
anything
to
balance
it
it
makes
me
feel
bloated
and
a
little
bit
nauseated
drinking
so
much
of
it
it
does
a
great
job
of
mimicking
a
brûlée
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
puree
such
a
dessert
and
quaff
it
such
thickness
and
sweetnessi
found
it
difficult
to
finish
despite
its
many
fine
attributes
o
i
know
this
beer
will
be
divisive
so
my
overall
will
follow
suit
its
fantastic
and
if
you
dont
think
so
then
you
are
an
idiot
for
either
1
picking
it
up
without
reading
the
bottles
description
and
expecting
something
other
than
a
sweet
creamy
toffee
vanilla
liquid
desert
or
2
dont
like
creme
brulee
so
why
did
you
pick
it
up
in
the
first
place
i
too
however
am
an
idiot
for
not
keeping
a
few
bombers
of
these
around
ready
for
when
that
hankering
calls
again
and
i
know
it
will
pours
a
bold
and
close
to
four
finger
head
of
dark
foam
airy
but
not
wispy
has
better
retention
than
youd
think
only
minor
surface
dimpling
the
lacing
is
thin
and
haphazardly
spread
across
the
glass
sides
clean
liquid
if
predictably
opaque
like
buffed
onyx
tiny
hint
of
orange
at
the
rims
the
nose
is
like
having
a
german
chocolate
cake
smashed
into
your
face
coconut
caramel
butterscotch
chocolate
only
a
slight
roasted
edge
some
candied
oranges
this
has
a
take
no
prisoners
approach
fullbodied
same
story
in
the
mouth
unbearably
sweet
like
a
hose
force
feeding
you
toffee
caramel
and
butterscotch
this
almost
makes
it
hard
to
register
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
carbonation
is
super
soft
and
adds
to
the
fluffy
character
heavy
on
the
maraschino
cherries
and
again
candied
oranges
does
an
odd
bitter
twist
at
the
end
cant
fault
it
for
intensity
of
flavor
but
it
was
a
concerted
effort
to
finish
the
bomber
this
ones
on
the
sweet
side
but
delicious
nonetheless
it
really
does
taste
like
a
liquid
creme
brulee
another
fine
beer
from
southern
tier
overall
this
is
definitely
a
desert
beer
the
wife
loves
it
in
the
right
company
this
would
be
a
hit
o
it
is
what
is
says
it
is
its
a
creme
brûlée
in
a
glass
cheers
overall
good
beer
for
a
relaxing
night
to
enjoy
with
someone
on
a
cool
night
like
i
said
slightly
too
sweet
for
me
but
good
for
someone
not
use
to
stouts
overall
well
for
starters
i
think
i
may
have
diabetes
now
putting
that
aside
though
my
opinion
on
this
one
is
tough
to
describe
the
flavors
on
this
are
pretty
nice
and
it
really
does
taste
close
to
liquid
creme
brulee
however
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
very
quickly
and
drinkability
is
extremely
low
itd
be
nice
to
have
in
a
45oz
serving
but
anything
beyond
that
is
too
much
this
has
no
business
being
sold
in
a
22oz
bottle
o
chewy
share
with
friends
sweet
and
intense
o
interesting
brew
way
too
sweet
had
to
mix
it
with
pumking
to
mellow
it
out
o
for
what
i
envisioned
this
is
a
dessertish
stout
it
stands
up
pretty
well
i
think
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prevalent
and
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
maltiness
to
it
i
realize
it
is
an
imperial
which
is
why
i
rated
it
a
little
higher
than
my
tastes
would
have
dictated
overall
i
do
not
want
to
ever
drink
this
again
or
anything
else
with
that
guinnesslike
metal
tasting
bitter
finish
i
do
like
to
smell
it
but
i
guess
that
is
just
a
tease
o
so
i
have
to
admit
i
personally
am
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
however
that
being
said
the
name
creme
brulee
is
perfect
and
it
lives
up
to
its
name
if
you
like
over
powered
flavored
beer
you
will
love
this
if
you
dont
proceed
with
caution
regardless
it
is
worth
a
taste
to
expand
your
flavor
profiles
and
what
can
be
done
with
beer
i
rated
it
highly
because
the
name
fits
the
taste
and
although
i
dont
really
like
it
i
am
sure
others
will
love
it
o
amazing
i
love
this
brew
and
would
order
it
over
and
over
again
but
at
the
same
time
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
divides
people
and
i
can
see
why
o
delicous
and
delightful
dessert
beer
if
i
had
ordered
a
pint
i
probably
would
have
asked
for
either
kahlua
or
cointreau
as
an
accompaniment
hard
to
tell
that
this
was
an
alcoholic
beverage
this
is
the
stout
that
turned
me
into
the
addict
i
am
today
i
first
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
tour
it
was
super
smooth
and
had
a
taste
unlike
i
had
had
before
it
is
a
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
like
no
other
if
the
vanilla
sweetness
was
turned
down
just
a
pinch
this
beer
would
be
taken
to
a
5
the
smell
of
this
fine
stout
might
be
the
best
of
any
beer
out
there
and
makes
you
close
your
eyes
and
breath
in
deep
again
and
again
they
should
make
it
into
an
air
freshener
o
fantastic
beer
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
the
alcohol
presence
to
not
be
as
strong
for
the
first
sip
or
two
but
very
sweet
i
love
sweets
and
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
truly
is
dessert
in
a
bottle
if
you
enjoy
sweets
as
much
as
i
do
this
is
a
must
have
if
not
i
would
recommend
splitting
with
a
friend
or
tasting
it
first
overall
fantastic
for
what
it
is
a
dessert
beer
and
a
real
treat
i
recommend
splitting
a
22
ounce
bomber
with
a
friend
after
dinner
so
sweet
but
so
good
overall
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
could
taste
it
again
and
again
when
i
burped
just
got
the
feeling
it
aint
done
till
its
overdone
o
a
great
after
dinner
drink
a
definite
dessert
beer
recommended
moooo
o
southern
tier
has
explored
the
intersection
between
confection
and
stout
before
to
great
effect
crème
brulee
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
balance
as
the
vanilla
ultimately
took
over
overall
great
tasting
really
sweet
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
could
defiantly
buy
more
then
one
bottle
this
one
explores
the
uncharted
waters
of
stoutbrewing
territory
and
reaps
gloriously
unique
and
resplendent
rewards
southern
tier
creme
brulee
45
overall
drinkability
very
well
done
beer
and
definitely
a
dessert
complimenting
beer
when
i
had
this
with
vanilla
ice
cream
as
recommended
on
the
bottle
the
bitterness
really
came
out
and
complimented
the
ice
cream
sweet
aroma
with
bitter
roast
compliment
to
the
ice
cream
once
i
finished
the
ice
cream
and
let
my
palate
rest
a
bit
then
all
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
came
out
even
then
the
sweetness
was
tempered
by
the
roasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
while
i
want
another
bottle
to
crack
open
right
now
i
know
i
should
not
have
a
second
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
that
being
said
a
big
glass
of
this
beer
with
dessert
is
fantastic
hate
it
or
love
it
you
have
to
appreciate
it
its
very
unique
and
one
of
the
most
polarizing
beers
out
there
i
definitely
like
it
more
than
i
dislike
it
its
good
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
wow
this
beer
is
extraordinarily
sweet
and
intense
just
like
the
desert
it
is
named
after
it
truly
is
uncanny
how
strikingly
similar
the
aroma
is
to
actual
creme
brulee
i
was
hoping
that
some
of
the
stout
elements
would
be
a
bit
more
forward
in
the
aroma
but
they
definitely
shine
through
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
overall
this
beer
is
too
intensely
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
i
can
definitely
see
this
beer
as
a
fitting
after
dinner
treat
very
unique
great
desert
beer
definitely
not
a
session
beer
too
sweet
heavy
and
high
abv
o
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
beer
is
delicious
it
lives
up
to
its
name
of
being
a
big
and
bold
imperial
milk
stout
if
youre
a
fan
of
roasted
characteristics
in
a
stout
over
sweet
characteristics
you
might
want
to
stay
away
from
this
one
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
definitely
check
this
one
out
i
think
the
thing
that
puts
this
one
above
other
very
sweet
stouts
eg
imperial
biscotti
break
is
that
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
this
has
nearly
10
abv
and
is
immensely
sweet
but
is
still
very
very
drinkable
i
think
southern
tier
has
a
winner
here
cheers
o
fantastic
dessert
beer
this
does
well
after
a
meal
on
its
own
this
was
kind
of
a
jekyl
and
hyde
for
me
i
really
got
my
hopes
up
but
the
taste
is
disappointing
this
is
definitely
a
desert
beer
its
velvety
and
smooth
but
it
has
a
hard
edge
to
it
from
the
strong
vanilla
and
the
alcohol
its
creamy
and
tastes
a
lot
like
cream
as
it
warmed
the
malt
became
nutty
and
toasted
on
the
nose
i
cant
say
i
would
buy
this
again
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
small
pour
i
had
but
it
seemed
to
grow
on
me
tasted
like
a
liquer
and
not
really
like
a
beer
overall
rather
tasty
have
had
this
one
a
couple
of
times
now
and
found
that
i
like
it
best
with
a
drink
or
two
already
under
my
belt
probably
wouldnt
want
to
start
the
night
off
with
it
definitely
would
call
it
a
desert
beer
a
bit
sweeter
than
my
general
preference
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
slice
of
cake
not
something
you
could
drink
every
day
because
its
very
sweet
but
its
good
o
i
loved
it
i
do
like
sweet
things
i
have
read
a
lot
of
reviews
stating
that
this
is
too
sweet
it
is
def
pleasing
to
consume
but
share
the
love
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
its
for
sure
not
a
great
example
of
an
imperial
stout
but
as
a
dessert
beer
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
was
exactly
as
advertised
this
beer
had
pretty
bad
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
filling
and
the
flavors
did
a
decent
job
at
holing
my
attention
but
the
sweetness
was
so
high
that
theres
no
way
that
i
could
every
drink
a
full
bomber
of
it
half
the
bottle
was
a
bit
of
a
struggle
and
i
think
that
splitting
a
bottle
between
four
or
five
people
would
be
good
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
pretty
good
and
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
just
way
too
high
and
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
sweeter
beers
i
have
had
and
that
really
hurt
the
drinkability
i
wouldnt
by
this
beer
again
maybe
if
i
was
going
to
a
tasting
and
i
thought
some
people
would
like
but
other
than
that
i
wont
be
buying
another
bottle
anytime
soon
and
i
dont
think
age
would
improve
this
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
sweet
dessert
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
at
first
but
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
it
wore
on
me
the
flavors
were
nice
but
i
wish
more
of
that
stout
base
come
through
and
that
the
sweetness
was
really
toned
down
i
felt
like
i
may
need
an
insulin
shot
after
i
drank
half
of
the
bomber
i
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
to
make
this
beer
but
in
the
end
it
just
didnt
come
together
as
good
as
it
could
have
better
luck
next
time
guys
dark
as
midnight
but
just
a
bit
of
light
will
get
through
a
very
minimal
bit
of
foam
rests
on
top
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
absolutely
incredible
totally
nailed
the
smell
of
creme
brûlée
im
blown
away
that
vanilla
aroma
is
mixed
with
caramel
and
isabsolutely
amazing
with
undertones
of
dark
roast
the
caramel
flavoring
dominates
but
the
vanilla
sneaks
in
to
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
creamy
this
is
dessert
in
a
bottle
very
rich
and
decadent
o
sahfuckingweet
sure
its
actually
flavor
is
nice
but
this
is
so
hard
to
imbibe
its
not
even
funny
share
this
with
about
46
people
and
youll
thank
me
later
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
messy
i
dont
mind
its
messiness
or
the
booze
if
youre
not
expecting
crème
brulee
in
a
bottle
it
could
be
enjoyable
for
you
i
dont
regret
trying
this
but
i
might
not
repurchase
i
would
consider
it
specifically
for
a
desert
beer
i
like
it
despite
its
faults
overall
not
my
cup
of
beer
but
to
each
his
own
i
was
surprised
how
boozy
this
one
was
had
it
a
bit
cold
at
first
and
didnt
taste
the
sweetness
at
all
let
it
warm
up
for
a
while
then
it
changed
and
became
a
better
beer
not
quite
creme
brulee
and
not
dessert
like
the
smell
was
really
sweet
however
like
creme
brulee
has
a
sort
of
harsh
and
bitter
finish
that
lingers
on
your
palate
which
i
didnt
expect
not
the
best
not
the
worst
give
it
a
bb
if
i
want
dessert
beer
i
will
stick
with
chocolate
rain
yikes
very
robust
beer
packed
with
flavor
although
unfortunately
all
the
flavor
tastes
very
artificial
vanilla
and
butterscotch
butterscotch
butterscotch
also
quite
bitter
at
the
end
smells
like
it
tastes
i
tried
to
make
a
butterscotch
beer
once
and
just
dumped
a
lot
of
extract
in
it
of
course
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
doing
and
it
was
lousy
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
that
abomination
i
brewed
cant
say
much
other
than
its
strictly
a
lovehate
brew
if
you
want
a
novelty
beer
that
tastes
like
really
cheap
bitter
candy
youll
love
it
wow
where
to
start
after
reading
some
pretty
harsh
reviews
i
had
to
give
this
a
try
when
i
opened
the
bottle
the
vanilla
sweetness
filled
the
room
mouth
feel
was
fine
not
too
syrupy
definitely
a
dessert
beer
ill
easily
finish
the
bottle
but
then
agin
i
have
a
serious
sweet
tooth
you
really
should
try
it
once
if
i
had
to
describe
southern
tiers
creme
brulee
in
one
word
it
would
be
awkward
definitely
not
to
be
consumed
with
a
meal
its
far
too
sweet
i
can
easily
smell
its
overpowering
vanilla
scent
sitting
several
feet
away
from
my
glass
the
flavor
is
slightly
less
objectionable
the
taste
is
somewhat
more
subdued
than
the
smell
as
it
blends
with
the
sharp
chocolatemocha
flavors
of
the
roasted
malts
in
the
stout
medium
bodied
a
bit
chewy
good
things
but
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
this
style
i
felt
mouth
feel
would
probably
improve
on
nitro
overall
not
my
mug
of
beer
southern
tier
went
for
something
insane
but
got
something
ludicrous
instead
its
just
a
little
over
the
top
for
my
taste
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
for
9
6abv
and
although
it
was
sweet
it
was
fairly
easy
to
finish
a
bottle
dark
as
night
creamy
lattelike
froth
along
the
top
smells
like
bitter
chocolate
and
caramel
its
incredible
if
you
like
flavored
stouts
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
its
far
more
intense
opens
like
a
high
abv
stout
ends
like
an
iced
frappacino
what
impressed
me
most
was
the
finish
your
mouth
is
left
with
a
feeling
similar
to
finishing
a
satisfying
desert
not
a
beer
that
alone
makes
this
beer
worth
being
revisited
o
true
to
its
name
the
beer
drinks
like
liquid
crème
brûlée
the
caramel
sweetness
is
so
strong
making
it
a
perfect
dessert
beer
but
in
small
doses
i
was
glad
to
have
help
with
the
bomber
but
still
there
was
too
much
sweetness
drinkable
well
i
guess
unless
youre
diabetic
overall
very
tasty
beer
the
flavors
mask
the
abv
very
well
i
would
definitely
by
this
again
o
4
0
i
think
i
would
actually
like
this
better
if
i
wasnt
comparing
it
to
creme
brûlée
the
flavors
blend
perfectly
up
front
but
fade
a
little
unpleasant
id
have
this
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
sweet
desert
beer
like
an
irish
car
bomb
but
in
a
beer
great
hard
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
to
yourself
though
i
like
it
a
lot
on
tap
i
would
bet
that
it
is
also
good
in
a
bomber
overall
this
was
good
but
so
incredibly
rich
that
i
could
never
drink
more
than
a
small
glass
excellent
for
food
pairing
i
tasted
it
with
chicken
and
a
salad
with
vinaigrette
poured
into
a
large
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
black
with
thick
light
tan
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
along
the
side
of
the
glass
cracking
the
cap
open
revealed
tons
of
vanilla
in
the
aroma
that
is
the
case
when
the
beer
is
smelled
and
theres
some
nice
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
this
is
a
very
vanilla
forward
stout
the
best
description
for
the
flavor
is
dessert
in
a
glass
the
vanilla
from
the
aroma
is
present
in
the
flavor
with
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
like
roastiness
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
almost
tastes
like
a
brownie
the
body
is
full
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
moderate
this
is
an
excellent
beer
definitely
one
of
a
kind
sweet
sugary
and
milky
a
really
unique
take
on
an
imperial
stout
and
it
really
does
taste
like
creme
brulee
my
only
complaint
to
the
brewery
is
that
it
is
a
summer
and
early
fall
release
only
should
come
out
for
fall
and
winter
8
99
for
22
oz
bottle
o
i
cant
say
i
understand
the
hate
on
this
one
yes
it
has
lots
of
sweet
candylike
flavors
but
it
is
meant
to
mimic
a
dessert
and
it
does
that
in
my
opinion
it
actually
has
a
decent
amount
of
balance
because
of
the
big
roast
presence
a
unique
musttry
i
think
america
fuck
yeah
ointeresting
imp
stout
but
too
much
vanilla
for
me
may
be
better
aged
with
a
little
bourbon
to
tone
down
the
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
somewhat
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
enough
for
vanilla
to
stay
on
the
palate
for
a
long
while
after
the
last
sip
was
take
o
a
very
delicious
beer
just
crazy
different
from
most
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
glad
i
split
this
one
with
the
wife
this
is
for
sure
a
dessert
beer
as
it
is
way
to
sweet
to
have
more
than
1
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
9
6
abv
and
288
calories
per
bottle
i
was
attracted
to
tasting
something
different
and
surprise
how
well
it
smelled
after
opening
the
bottle
the
taste
was
extremely
offputting
vanilla
and
coffee
sounds
attractive
but
the
blunt
caramelbutterscotch
favor
that
kicks
in
does
not
match
well
with
the
combination
easily
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
ive
ever
had
to
be
fair
you
get
used
to
it
the
more
you
consume
but
it
was
just
a
weird
taste
at
first
this
is
one
combination
ill
probably
never
see
again
and
i
do
not
regret
trying
it
however
i
would
not
purchase
again
a
really
delicious
and
decadent
stout
but
overwhelmingly
a
beerasdesert
experience
this
isnt
even
trying
to
be
anything
but
rich
and
sweet
if
that
doesnt
sound
like
your
cup
of
tea
er
beer
then
you
wont
like
it
personally
im
enjoying
this
very
much
it
hides
its
strength
pretty
well
too
but
even
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
something
that
youll
want
to
share
and
not
just
because
of
the
potency
the
9
5
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
in
this
beer
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
i
would
reach
for
it
gets
better
as
you
go
through
the
bottle
but
be
ready
for
the
first
sip
cause
its
really
sweet
overall
a
little
too
intense
for
me
in
the
sweetness
department
which
says
a
lot
a
must
try
for
people
that
like
sweetdessert
style
beers
o
the
taste
is
very
strong
and
i
think
it
took
away
from
the
experience
a
little
bit
i
will
try
it
again
later
at
a
different
temp
when
i
had
this
it
was
over
50
degrees
im
sure
it
still
wasnt
bad
i
think
you
actually
get
used
to
the
taste
as
you
drink
it
the
smell
and
mouth
feel
are
incredible
in
fact
the
smell
itself
makes
it
really
worth
a
try
if
u
like
something
really
sweet
im
also
gonna
try
it
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
next
time
overall
my
god
this
is
the
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
had
i
know
a
lot
of
people
must
like
this
to
achieve
the
rating
it
has
gotten
but
holy
shit
it
made
me
cringe
it
was
so
sweet
it
made
me
cringe
when
i
even
thought
about
tasting
it
the
next
day
my
tasting
buddies
tried
to
salvage
it
by
putting
vanilla
ice
cream
scoops
in
it
eventually
we
chose
to
drain
pour
it
smells
nice
it
has
good
mouthfeel
and
it
looks
fine
but
i
cant
get
over
dat
sweetness
o
reviews
had
made
me
think
this
was
a
very
polarizing
beer
and
now
that
i
have
tasted
it
i
can
see
why
if
they
dialed
back
the
sweetnessvanillacreme
brulee
flavor
by
half
and
made
it
more
of
a
sweet
stout
with
some
of
those
flavors
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
as
it
is
this
comes
across
as
a
horrible
mess
i
cant
imagine
drinking
even
a
6
or
8
ounce
pour
it
is
just
too
sweetoverwhelming
this
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
o
this
is
what
a
stout
should
be
a
sweet
dessert
beer
i
absolutely
love
it
and
will
absolutely
be
getting
it
again
atmosphere
is
really
nice
dark
with
a
tight
foamy
head
only
slight
lacing
though
nose
is
roasted
coffee
charred
grains
and
strong
character
of
vanilla
coffee
licorice
and
peat
cut
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
would
i
buy
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
though
no
not
unless
i
happened
to
be
sharing
it
this
is
pretty
much
the
very
definition
of
a
dessert
beer
sweet
tasty
awesome
stuff
the
abv
doesnt
come
at
all
in
the
aroma
and
it
may
only
be
traceable
in
the
taste
due
to
a
very
slight
warmth
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
southern
tier
and
one
that
any
dessertchocolate
fan
should
enjoy
its
just
hard
to
see
me
buying
this
again
knowing
that
its
only
in
22oz
bottles
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
admittedly
stouts
are
not
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
but
ive
had
enough
of
them
to
understand
the
style
thought
the
beer
smelled
great
but
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
the
alcohol
was
not
masked
and
overpowered
the
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
definitely
a
desserty
beer
but
good
910
would
drink
again
sourcing
purchased
at
specs
in
austin
texas
in
june
of
2013
for
9
99
plus
tax
for
a
twentytwo
ounce
bomber
overall
very
sweet
good
for
what
it
is
couldnt
drink
this
everyday
but
still
damn
good
probably
the
best
dessert
beer
ive
ever
had
excellent
job
southern
tier
good
beer
o
enjoyed
it
not
an
everyday
beer
for
sure
and
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
but
definitely
another
solid
beer
from
southern
tier
this
is
a
very
sweet
smooth
and
well
balanced
brew
i
have
been
waiting
on
this
beer
to
get
here
to
alabama
this
brew
should
be
paired
with
a
good
dessert
or
just
alone
after
a
great
meal
this
brew
is
most
definitely
a
panty
dropper
chicks
must
really
love
this
brew
as
well
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
brew
you
need
to
stag
a
few
bottles
most
definitely
worth
it
i
would
recommend
sharing
this
with
4
people
because
its
so
darn
big
of
a
beer
im
into
interesting
beers
so
this
was
a
great
treat
not
for
everyone
probably
will
enjoy
or
hate
this
one
overall
a
very
good
imperial
milksweet
stout
big
rich
and
creamy
very
sweet
but
still
pretty
smooth
overall
a
unique
and
delightful
beer
would
be
perfect
with
the
right
desserts
or
as
dessert
to
be
honest
very
tasty
but
i
do
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
so
be
warned
definitely
a
sipping
beer
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
that
is
more
of
a
sipper
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
my
biggest
thing
is
it
was
a
little
sweet
had
it
in
summer
and
probably
better
in
the
winter
but
they
nailed
the
taste
just
a
tad
too
much
o
awesome
beer
im
really
quit
blown
away
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
interesting
and
unique
i
cant
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
i
appreciate
what
st
is
doing
here
o
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
i
love
this
beer
then
again
i
do
have
quite
the
sweet
tooth
pairs
great
with
vanilla
ice
cream
as
the
label
suggests
i
poured
a
little
bit
over
the
ice
cream
and
the
combo
creates
a
rumlike
flavor
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
lighter
color
head
that
fizzed
and
went
away
fairly
quick
not
much
lacing
as
my
glass
goes
down
damn
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
ridiculous
it
smells
like
i
could
get
a
cavity
from
drinking
it
huge
butterscotch
scents
tons
of
sugar
very
intimidating
the
taste
doesnt
follow
the
scent
as
much
i
thought
it
would
im
getting
more
coffee
roasted
malts
little
sugar
its
almost
like
putting
some
butterscotch
creamer
in
your
coffee
with
a
couple
sweetnlows
this
ones
not
for
me
it
was
fun
to
try
but
i
wont
be
back
poured
entire
bomber
into
34oz
mug
dark
brown
pour
black
in
the
glass
with
toffeebrown
around
the
edges
and
a
thin
brown
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
with
spotty
lacing
smell
is
huge
caramel
and
toffee
with
malts
hidden
in
there
somewhere
and
a
tiny
hint
of
alcohol
taste
isnt
as
heavy
on
the
carameltoffee
as
the
smell
but
its
definitely
there
sweetness
explodes
up
front
with
the
trademark
bitter
coffeechocolate
of
a
stout
only
coming
in
to
finish
off
leaves
a
bit
of
sticky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
its
a
slow
drinker
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
this
wouldnt
be
an
every
day
beer
but
it
would
pair
amazingly
with
desert
or
as
a
nightcap
overall
its
the
polarizing
beer
that
i
expected
theres
no
balance
here
none
at
all
if
youre
a
fan
of
an
aggressive
vanilla
profile
than
this
is
for
you
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
subtle
a
bit
more
balanced
and
more
complex
this
brew
isnt
for
you
it
certainly
wasnt
for
me
a
polarizer
for
sure
i
can
take
a
small
amount
a
year
and
be
happy
with
it
o
i
dont
know
what
to
say
so
you
like
your
pine
cones
dipped
in
vanilla
icing
this
is
your
beer
do
you
like
expensive
vanillaheavy
desserts
but
hate
the
whole
chewing
thing
grab
a
bottle
i
actually
liked
this
experience
though
and
thats
the
weird
part
my
brain
tells
me
this
is
too
sweet
but
i
keep
drinking
its
a
strange
beer
but
its
mesmerizing
at
the
same
time
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
this
beer
is
great
really
smells
like
creme
brulee
its
has
a
sweet
taste
but
then
it
doesnt
the
smell
is
sweet
but
the
beer
has
a
nice
stout
taste
and
feel
i
put
some
in
a
snifter
then
put
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
in
itand
it
was
great
a
must
try
overall
wow
this
beer
aged
well
accessible
yet
complex
multifaceted
but
it
emphasizes
the
vanilla
just
really
darn
good
would
definitely
buy
again
a
decent
beer
but
i
got
sick
of
it
pretty
quick
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
really
heavy
with
intense
flavor
this
may
hit
the
spot
i
hope
this
helps
you
to
enjoy
one
of
the
most
unique
and
flavorful
beers
on
the
market
and
i
do
believe
that
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
used
must
be
outstanding
next
time
pass
this
is
an
all
around
great
beer
if
you
like
milk
stouts
try
this
sucker
out
it
has
a
rich
and
creamy
color
and
tastes
great
too
even
at
nearly
10
abv
it
goes
down
smooth
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
is
at
one
sip
it
will
leave
you
with
some
dank
coffee
breath
for
the
rest
of
the
night
consider
yourself
warned
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
actually
pair
with
creme
brulee
sometime
as
it
would
match
quite
well
this
is
most
definitely
a
desert
beer
this
is
not
a
beer
for
every
day
asthe
namesake
would
suggest
it
is
a
dessert
beer
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
i
read
some
of
the
reviews
that
were
extremely
critical
they
qare
failing
to
recognize
that
this
is
a
dessert
beer
just
a
the
name
would
suggest
yes
it
is
sweet
but
so
are
mose
desserts
itis
an
outstqaning
beer
for
its
intended
purpose
o
loads
and
loads
of
my
favorite
flavor
on
earth
vanilla
so
of
course
im
going
to
give
it
an
a
overly
sweet
yes
but
still
absolutely
delicious
overall
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
it
everyday
however
for
special
family
occasions
its
a
great
dessert
southern
tier
doesnt
disappoint
again
overall
this
is
goodits
very
sweet
and
flavorful
but
its
almost
too
much
to
still
be
considered
a
beerthe
alcohol
is
covered
with
tremendous
flavor
though
i
know
one
will
do
me
goodi
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
routine
selectionit
would
be
tough
to
drink
more
than
22
ounces
in
one
sitting
thus
the
overall
doesnt
necessarily
match
up
with
the
individual
parts35
o
a
really
delicious
beer
easy
drinking
great
great
beer
o
this
proved
to
be
an
elusive
beer
for
me
finally
lucked
out
at
villages
draft
house
in
raleigh
nc
i
went
to
the
bar
for
the
sole
purpose
of
trying
this
on
beer
only
to
be
told
that
they
had
sold
out
shortly
before
my
arrival
the
waitress
was
kind
enough
to
convince
the
bar
tender
to
squeak
out
just
enough
from
the
keg
for
a
sample
glad
she
did
because
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
and
the
trouble
i
will
admit
it
was
much
better
from
the
tap
than
it
was
from
the
bottle
in
both
cases
it
was
exceptional
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
with
the
fairly
high
abv
extremely
well
hidden
super
enjoyable
i
think
of
this
beer
as
dessert
with
the
sweetness
and
it
delivers
on
the
namedescription
i
have
enjoyed
this
one
since
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
many
of
my
family
have
grown
to
enjoy
it
as
well
after
having
me
suggest
they
try
it
o
knowing
that
a
lot
of
people
arent
big
fans
of
southern
tiers
emulation
style
of
brewing
i
did
rather
like
their
oat
choklat
and
mokah
when
i
tried
them
this
however
is
just
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
me
a
big
swing
ill
grant
them
that
and
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
probably
go
well
with
people
that
have
either
an
immense
sweet
tooth
or
just
well
sorry
i
cant
begin
to
imagine
how
anyone
could
like
this
that
is
however
just
my
opinion
and
i
like
the
fact
that
southern
tier
either
goes
big
or
goes
home
big
kudos
on
that
o
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
know
what
you
are
getting
yourself
into
and
enjoy
this
one
edit
this
beer
is
crazy
polarizing
its
a
ton
of
fun
to
read
all
the
polemical
reviews
in
closing
try
it
if
you
must
it
was
one
of
those
pure
curiosity
things
for
me
will
never
buy
again
this
beer
is
pitch
black
with
some
red
tints
around
the
edges
a
foamy
brown
head
sits
on
top
for
a
shirt
while
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
at
first
i
was
expecting
a
roasty
sweet
stout
which
it
is
but
its
more
different
then
you
may
think
this
beer
has
a
good
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
dry
feel
that
lasts
all
the
way
through
there
is
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
a
possible
hint
of
vanilla
some
coffee
notes
and
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
strongest
flavor
in
this
beer
is
unlike
anything
i
have
had
in
a
beer
before
imagine
a
liquid
form
of
oreo
icing
mixed
with
coffee
and
served
on
a
hershey
bar
an
extremely
sweet
beer
its
best
in
small
portions
because
it
is
so
sweet
the
beer
is
not
too
thick
but
has
a
velvety
smooth
feel
this
beer
does
not
go
well
with
a
meal
and
is
sure
to
be
the
only
thing
you
can
drink
in
a
single
setting
a
great
desert
beer
so
treat
it
as
such
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
with
enough
caramel
to
make
it
distinctive
and
reminiscent
of
a
crème
brûlée
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
tastes
a
lot
more
of
beer
than
i
expected
everybody
told
me
its
like
drinking
a
liquidized
crème
brûlée
but
its
not
its
sweet
and
has
a
nice
vanilla
flavor
but
is
quite
well
balanced
compared
to
other
milk
stouts
that
ive
had
very
tasty
and
special
however
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
i
like
many
10
beers
but
this
one
tastes
a
bit
of
alcohol
also
its
not
pretty
looks
like
water
from
a
dead
lake
from
notes
it
was
something
to
try
wouldnt
have
a
whole
bottle
4
or
6
oz
is
plenty
and
think
i
will
pass
on
getting
this
another
time
i
should
start
by
saying
a
bomber
of
this
for
a
single
person
is
more
than
challenging
its
downright
difficult
however
this
is
a
clever
one
totally
distinct
from
anything
else
ive
ever
had
out
there
the
pours
is
inky
black
just
a
little
brown
left
visible
with
zero
head
just
a
think
mocha
colored
film
the
nose
is
brilliant
burnt
sugar
scorched
chocolate
malt
brown
butter
brutal
sweetness
this
has
all
the
elements
of
a
delicious
french
dessert
the
flavor
too
is
very
akin
to
the
genuine
article
although
it
is
a
diminishing
marginal
return
really
as
the
sweetness
starts
to
rot
the
teeth
and
the
gut
after
about
a
third
of
the
bottle
vanilla
beans
heavy
through
the
front
end
while
the
brnt
sugar
custardy
component
comes
in
later
the
dark
malts
last
throughout
alcohol
also
becomes
quite
potent
as
it
warms
up
the
feel
is
thick
as
any
beer
ive
had
i
think
super
dense
quite
custardesque
really
as
it
well
should
be
minimal
carbonation
exacerbates
this
feature
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
because
it
truly
is
yummy
and
unique
but
this
is
not
a
beer
that
can
be
consumed
with
any
kind
of
efficiency
or
regularity
it
is
indeed
a
monster
the
sugar
just
makes
it
gnarly
to
drink
much
of
the
label
is
brilliant
and
the
beer
is
just
as
good
a
must
try
but
proceed
with
a
couple
of
buddies
b
wonderful
smell
wonderful
idea
i
love
creme
brulee
however
i
feel
the
execution
was
off
on
this
one
it
was
a
little
too
overpowering
with
the
vanilla
and
the
sweetness
wasnt
balanced
thus
making
it
difficult
to
drink
during
the
lower
half
of
the
glass
id
like
to
see
this
one
toned
down
and
refined
a
bit
i
think
it
has
a
chance
to
be
very
good
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
slight
light
brown
head
the
scent
is
a
rich
sweet
stout
with
a
fantastic
vanilla
aroma
the
taste
is
rich
complex
and
delicious
initially
you
get
the
bold
taste
of
the
robust
malts
but
then
a
finish
that
is
sweet
from
caramel
malts
and
vanilla
has
a
strong
vanilla
linger
after
taste
this
is
something
you
have
to
try
for
yourself
no
words
can
describe
the
unique
flavor
of
this
brew
o
its
dessert
in
a
glass
but
is
sickly
sweet
im
going
to
have
a
hard
time
drinking
this
all
to
myself
o
sort
of
an
odd
beer
it
would
taste
better
if
the
roasted
malthop
bitterness
werent
as
astringent
not
very
drinkable
o
i
enjoy
the
black
water
series
from
st
they
are
really
great
paired
with
desserts
something
to
grab
with
a
friend
and
sit
back
and
enjoy
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
how
southern
tier
actual
got
this
beer
to
smell
and
taste
like
creme
brulee
is
pretty
amazing
and
while
it
may
not
be
supercomplex
all
the
flavors
are
solid
and
in
good
proportion
to
one
another
i
really
enjoyed
pretty
much
everything
about
this
beer
im
just
wondering
how
it
took
me
this
long
to
actually
try
it
o
this
is
a
true
dessert
beer
that
nails
the
taste
of
creme
brulee
that
in
itself
makes
this
beer
worth
a
try
after
a
good
meal
the
extreme
sweetness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
overall
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
this
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
little
tan
head
its
nose
was
awesome
from
the
getgo
strong
coffee
and
vanilla
very
sweet
its
flavor
was
somewhat
less
powerful
but
still
very
delicious
it
was
full
bodied
and
definitely
one
ill
have
again
id
especially
like
to
try
it
on
tap
o
this
beer
delivers
on
all
it
advertises
and
more
i
recently
discovered
a
new
love
for
milk
stouts
but
this
one
goes
above
and
beyond
maybe
its
the
vanilla
or
caramel
but
this
is
a
beer
you
cant
put
down
o
a
few
rough
edges
especially
the
hops
notes
i
think
they
could
have
toned
them
down
or
picked
a
different
variety
and
the
strong
presence
of
ethanol
but
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
next
time
i
think
ill
share
it
among
a
group
of
about
4
guys
as
a
bottle
is
a
bit
too
rich
and
heavy
to
consume
alone
in
one
sitting
update
as
im
continuing
to
sip
it
and
as
its
warmed
im
getting
some
hazelnut
coconut
and
pecan
notes
the
aroma
is
also
really
picking
up
the
butterscotch
and
getting
a
little
more
boozy
as
it
warms
o
pretty
cool
beer
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
definitely
sweet
i
like
vanilla
stouts
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
maybe
a
tad
sweet
to
have
in
large
volumes
but
damn
good
odthe
only
other
southern
tier
stout
i
have
had
in
this
format
is
their
choklat
i
liked
choklat
but
found
it
to
be
a
bit
overrated
i
enjoyed
this
one
considerably
more
here
i
find
less
sickening
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
flavor
diversity
creme
brûlée
coarser
but
delicious
nonetheless
i
get
off
on
unique
drinkable
beers
this
falls
into
that
category
i
would
not
drink
this
every
night
but
im
both
glad
it
was
made
and
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
open
a
22
and
share
it
with
4
people
and
everyone
will
get
the
idea
and
enjoy
it
i
am
amazed
this
is
drinkable
take
home
message
if
youre
curious
its
worth
giving
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
its
good
for
a
novelty
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
getting
more
than
once
d
dessert
beer
from
outer
space
i
dont
have
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
so
its
hard
to
drink
this
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
overall
this
beer
would
be
killer
if
that
alcohol
wasnt
so
dominating
there
are
great
tastes
notes
and
the
beer
stays
true
to
what
the
name
incites
after
the
alcohol
dissipates
there
is
a
bitterness
that
seems
to
come
from
nowhere
the
finish
is
so
bad
i
have
to
knock
it
down
to
a
3
5
so
much
potential
though
o
its
a
good
imperial
stout
its
quite
clearly
off
the
wall
but
its
enjoyable
o
maybe
the
most
unique
beer
ive
ever
had
enjoy
a
few
bottles
of
this
every
year
not
for
everyone
but
for
a
dessert
beer
they
really
nailed
this
one
o
deliciously
sweet
it
met
and
exceeded
my
expectations
but
in
doing
so
it
might
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
definitely
not
something
you
could
drink
all
day
maybe
not
even
something
you
could
have
more
than
a
small
glass
of
in
one
sitting
a
slow
sipping
dessert
beer
that
o
another
solid
stout
from
southern
tier
but
id
take
a
mokah
or
java
before
this
one
its
still
a
good
one
to
sit
down
sip
and
just
relax
to
i
think
the
vanilla
intensity
might
be
just
a
bit
much
for
me
but
its
still
worth
a
try
something
i
would
try
again
overall
it
is
decadently
rich
and
for
the
most
part
it
pulls
it
off
i
would
label
this
as
a
dessert
beer
it
starts
off
great
but
the
sweetness
and
richness
become
tiring
before
a
full
glass
is
finished
if
you
dont
have
a
dessert
to
pair
with
it
o
this
is
a
good
dessert
beer
would
be
a
good
one
for
a
810oz
pour
a
bomber
by
yourself
is
just
too
much
though
creamy
vanilla
and
dark
caramel
notes
cover
the
palate
its
sweet
but
that
is
to
be
expected
of
this
style
definitely
one
packing
such
amazing
flavors
just
like
the
aromas
it
truly
delivers
the
flavor
amazing
dessert
beer
o
not
at
all
drinkable
but
this
is
a
very
good
dessert
beer
and
this
would
be
a
very
difficult
beer
to
replicate
i
give
stbc
credit
for
this
beer
dont
start
off
with
the
beer
though
it
will
likely
ruin
your
experience
with
all
other
beers
this
is
something
to
sip
at
the
end
of
your
night
overall
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
for
the
simple
reason
that
its
pretty
over
the
top
in
flavor
awesome
idea
for
an
imperial
milk
stout
for
sure
i
do
think
the
abv
stuck
out
a
little
too
much
though
and
at
9
a
bomber
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
it
again
unless
i
buy
it
to
age
it
which
seems
like
itd
be
a
great
idea
id
imagine
a
lot
of
veterans
have
beenwill
be
bashing
this
beer
because
of
the
overly
sugary
syrupy
boozy
flavor
but
hey
thats
what
you
get
for
buying
an
imperial
milk
stout
i
try
to
rate
the
beers
according
to
which
category
they
fall
under
and
for
an
imperial
milk
stout
id
say
southern
tier
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
o
pretty
delicious
if
youre
looking
for
a
sugary
sweet
dessert
beer
very
enjoyable
like
most
of
the
bomber
stouts
from
southern
tier
its
exploding
with
adjunct
flavors
which
is
never
a
bad
thing
note
that
this
years
batch
2012
had
a
bit
better
appearance
and
a
longer
lastingbigger
head
appearance
bumped
half
a
point
this
smells
great
but
the
flavor
is
way
to
cloying
to
have
more
than
4
to
6
oz
at
a
time
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
ive
had
id
like
to
mix
this
with
a
solid
stout
to
cut
the
sweetness
down
a
bit
good
for
a
4oz
dessert
cap
overall
a
nice
sipper
after
dinner
for
dessert
the
flavors
transition
well
and
complement
each
other
nicely
a
good
sweet
stout
if
i
must
say
tastes
just
like
creme
brûlée
too
maple
syrup
vanilla
dominate
its
very
sweet
right
up
front
and
through
the
finish
it
almost
tastes
a
bit
doughy
and
is
thick
too
lower
end
of
carbonation
but
a
full
body
make
this
beer
a
true
desert
beer
when
you
combine
that
with
its
other
qualities
i
like
it
a
lot
southern
tiers
creme
brulee
pours
totally
black
theres
about
a
finger
or
so
of
mocha
foam
crowning
the
beer
head
retention
is
pretty
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
head
retention
the
nose
has
lots
of
vanilla
and
some
burnt
sugar
but
not
much
else
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
aromas
from
actual
beer
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
as
burnt
sugar
comes
to
the
forefront
and
is
a
bit
acrid
vanilla
is
also
still
there
and
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bit
of
roasty
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
becomes
apparent
the
body
is
nice
full
and
just
a
little
bit
creamy
and
paired
with
a
nicely
subdued
carbonation
creme
brulee
is
an
interesting
idea
for
a
beer
but
in
execution
the
flavoring
is
a
bit
over
the
top
the
beer
is
quite
dark
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
tan
i
could
smell
vanilla
it
was
quite
a
strong
smell
first
taste
vanilla
cream
some
roasted
malt
and
coffee
for
an
aftertaste
a
little
sweetness
the
beer
feels
like
im
drinking
a
creme
brulee
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
so
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
other
people
might
not
be
able
to
drink
as
much
in
one
sitting
o
ill
go
with
this
being
a
bit
sweeter
than
id
like
the
vanilla
vapors
lent
it
some
dryness
on
the
finish
but
it
was
very
richly
filling
i
e
i
only
wanted
a
little
after
id
had
some
southern
tier
has
a
talent
for
making
strong
sweet
flavordriven
beers
this
is
a
beer
for
someone
who
wants
to
be
drenched
in
vanilla
rather
than
say
hinted
at
overall
i
think
choklat
and
mokah
are
better
but
this
one
comes
pretty
close
just
too
sweet
overall
55
oddly
this
has
been
one
of
the
favorite
beers
of
the
summer
and
has
found
its
way
into
my
fridge
and
glass
more
often
than
any
other
and
while
the
warm
months
arent
the
typical
time
one
gets
a
hankering
for
a
big
roasty
black
ale
the
number
of
times
ive
had
southern
tier
crème
brûlée
this
summer
is
a
testament
to
its
greatness
i
recommend
this
beer
highly
it
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
this
beer
was
absolutely
delicious
a
ton
of
flavor
all
well
balanced
its
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
because
it
is
very
filling
and
sweet
but
one
is
all
you
need
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
again
drinkability
its
just
two
sweet
for
me
to
drink
much
of
it
i
think
southern
tier
got
exactly
what
they
wanted
for
this
and
i
agree
its
a
great
beer
i
suppose
im
just
not
as
big
of
a
sweet
tooth
as
i
thought
i
was
o
awesome
stout
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
dessert
beer
one
bottle
am
im
ready
formthe
recliner
overall
this
is
sure
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
if
ever
there
was
one
and
i
loves
it
awesome
do
you
like
your
beer
to
taste
like
beer
or
like
dessert
that
will
decide
how
much
you
enjoy
this
beer
i
quite
like
it
just
for
being
so
interesting
d
very
drinkable
very
much
a
dessert
beer
super
bold
but
also
very
tasty
o
a
great
beer
for
dessert
afterdinner
food
pairings
or
for
a
beer
drinker
that
has
a
sweettooth
i
enjoyed
the
first
glass
poured
out
of
a
32oz
growler
the
rest
was
regretfully
drained
to
the
mouth
from
price
obligations
i
would
never
recommend
this
beer
stout
and
imperial
stout
are
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
but
this
was
disgusting
ive
never
reviewed
a
beer
before
but
after
opening
this
one
and
the
southern
tier
chokolat
which
is
equally
awful
i
had
to
review
them
this
is
something
else
wow
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
tried
intense
to
say
the
least
i
think
about
half
the
16oz
growler
will
be
enough
for
tonight
drinkability
takes
a
hit
just
because
it
is
so
rich
but
very
tasty
in
small
doses
quite
the
feat
in
craft
brewing
super
sweet
but
super
good
treat
it
as
a
dessert
beer
and
you
wont
be
let
down

my
hat
goes
off
to
this
brewery
i
have
never
had
anything
like
this
before
od
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
know
how
to
really
judge
it
it
is
so
sweet
so
strong
and
it
meets
the
name
however
as
a
strong
milk
stout
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
there
as
far
the
beer
it
is
filling
with
a
good
hit
of
alcohol
o
better
than
last
year
sweetness
is
still
the
main
attraction
but
the
malt
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
actually
allows
it
to
drink
like
more
of
a
stout
excellent
big
malty
brew
with
lots
of
interesting
complex
flavors
tasty
stuff
i
dont
find
it
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
some
say
in
fact
its
fairly
wellbalanced
and
the
recreation
of
custard
dessert
flavors
with
nothing
but
vanilla
and
lactose
is
pretty
impressive
good
stuff
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
went
well
with
a
slice
of
cheesecake
key
here
is
to
pair
it
with
something
even
sweeter
say
a
slice
of
turtle
cheescake
because
in
comparison
the
beer
is
not
as
sweet
the
aroma
is
amazing
and
the
initial
taste
is
sweetchocolatevanilla
but
then
in
the
end
all
i
could
taste
was
bitter
dark
chocolateburnt
malt
flavor
and
it
wouldnt
go
away
that
ruined
the
beer
for
me
too
over
the
top
in
the
aftertaste
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
mouthfeel
was
motor
oily
very
little
head
in
the
glass
if
burnt
coffee
taste
is
your
thing
then
you
would
love
this
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
it
does
get
better
by
adding
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
but
its
not
enough
to
save
it
for
me
tried
this
guy
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
i
picked
up
at
the
local
boozery
very
stoutlike
in
its
color
and
pour
it
had
almost
no
head
at
all
and
a
powerful
vanilla
smell
the
flavor
is
amazing
but
very
sweet
thanks
to
a
heavy
dose
of
lactose
the
only
negative
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
finishes
thick
and
sticky
and
even
someone
who
really
likes
stouts
would
have
trouble
drinking
alot
of
it
overall
a
great
dessert
beer
get
yours
now
today
check
all
beer
places
and
buy
as
many
bottles
as
you
can
well
save
some
just
get
3
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
absolutely
1
in
a
million
insane
great
beer
overall
a
fine
if
onedimensional
stout
the
nose
is
really
the
standout
part
of
this
drink
othis
is
a
pretty
good
beer
very
powerful
this
was
a
total
shock
to
my
nose
and
mouth
but
it
is
nicely
sweet
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
on
the
finish
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
amazing
southern
have
made
a
beer
that
tastes
exactly
like
creme
brulee
if
i
was
in
a
resteraunt
with
the
wife
this
would
finish
it
off
nicely
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
but
a
22oz
was
perfect
first
of
all
i
gotta
say
wow
this
beer
is
amazing
i
poured
it
into
a
tulip
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
nose
i
get
tons
of
vanilla
and
custard
up
front
taste
again
a
bunch
of
vanilla
custard
vanilla
cake
and
finishes
with
roasty
notes
its
got
a
pretty
good
and
full
mouth
feel
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
and
totally
hits
the
creme
brulee
right
on
the
head
ive
sorta
steered
clear
of
southern
tier
here
lately
but
their
dessert
beers
this
and
choklat
are
second
to
none
edit
i
almost
ended
up
pouring
this
down
the
drain
but
i
found
that
it
meshes
strangely
well
with
peanut
butter
as
long
as
you
dont
accidentally
smell
it
drinking
this
while
eating
peanut
butter
is
kind
of
pleasant
much
more
drinkable
and
delicious
than
expected
i
really
like
this
one
creme
brulee
pours
a
black
color
with
very
little
lacy
head
there
is
a
very
creamy
nice
sweet
aroma
like
dessert
the
taste
is
very
creamy
and
starts
sweet
with
lots
of
vanilla
taste
then
it
finishes
with
a
boozy
and
bitter
taste
very
easy
to
drink
and
overall
a
very
nice
and
unique
beer
fantastic
for
dessert
as
the
name
suggests
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
auburntoblack
coloring
with
a
dense
foamy
beige
colored
head
the
supersweet
caramel
aromas
waft
off
the
glass
while
you
pour
on
closer
inspection
there
are
layers
of
cream
sweetness
roasty
notes
and
rich
caramel
flavors
are
rich
and
uber
sweet
dark
roasty
coffee
backbone
supports
a
rich
ribbon
of
darkly
sweet
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
this
is
a
rich
extremely
sweet
brew
tons
of
flavor
packed
into
a
smooth
light
bodied
stout
the
aftertaste
is
hard
to
discern
initially
due
to
the
abundance
of
sweet
flavors
but
it
is
a
mild
bitter
roasted
blending
rich
slightly
cloying
finish
this
is
one
for
those
with
a
large
sweettooth
that
is
for
sure
if
you
like
impy
stouts
or
thick
sugary
desserts
this
belongs
on
your
gotta
have
list
nothing
else
comes
close
color
is
deep
and
brown
opaque
nothing
special
on
the
pour
but
the
smell
wow
practically
all
vanilla
with
some
cocoa
and
light
nut
the
taste
is
just
as
powerful
tons
of
vanilla
with
a
great
left
over
taste
the
perfect
after
dinner
beer
forget
dessert
beer
this
thing
is
dessert
im
going
back
to
my
local
pub
just
for
this
because
it
is
so
unique
hats
off
to
southern
tier
for
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
here
its
a
very
specific
beerone
that
you
would
specifically
seek
out
not
just
because
youre
itching
for
an
imperial
stout
lots
of
sweetnessa
perfect
dessert
beer
if
you
so
choose
would
pair
very
very
well
with
ice
cream
o
fantastic
dessert
beer
love
it
and
got
three
bottles
to
cellar
and
will
keep
adding
next
year
you
have
to
like
the
sweet
stuff
to
appreciate
this
tried
brewing
my
own
clone
which
is
good
but
pales
in
comparison
to
this
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
year
of
aging
does
this
beer
pours
out
black
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
on
a
serious
creme
brulee
tip
burnt
sugar
caramel
milk
chocolate
its
diabetariffic
the
taste
is
a
bit
roasty
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
at
first
but
goes
quickly
to
the
super
sweet
burnt
sugar
milk
and
caramel
flavors
i
cant
really
fault
it
on
taste
it
really
does
taste
like
creme
brulee
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
lightly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
strange
here
it
absolutely
does
mask
the
alcohol
completely
yet
the
beer
is
so
sweet
that
it
is
still
rather
difficult
to
drink
overall
this
is
really
what
the
label
says
its
a
creme
brulee
stout
its
a
good
dessert
beer
just
dont
go
into
it
thinking
youre
going
to
be
able
to
drink
all
22
ounces
because
you
wont
be
able
to
get
it
on
tap
or
split
it
with
a
friend
or
two
o
overall
fantastic
if
i
could
buy
a
case
of
this
beer
i
would
two
months
ago
i
came
within
five
minutes
of
getting
this
on
tap
at
dexters
pub
during
mad
craft
beer
week
im
so
lucky
to
find
this
on
the
shelves
today
so
far
into
summer
thank
you
star
liquor
i
have
to
give
this
beer
a
good
review
because
its
so
unique
and
distinct
i
havent
found
anything
else
quite
like
it
plus
i
think
it
tastes
good
the
sweetness
brought
on
by
the
vanilla
and
the
addition
of
lactose
sugar
is
so
extreme
you
sometimes
forget
youre
drinking
a
beer
that
said
this
beer
is
one
that
a
beer
drinker
will
either
love
or
hate
theres
not
much
middle
ground
try
it
if
you
like
imperial
stouts
and
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
do
note
i
hope
southern
tier
keeps
brewing
this
and
other
extremely
crazy
beers
there
are
many
people
out
there
with
tastes
that
match
up
with
this
stuff
if
you
like
sweeter
brews
or
want
to
try
some
overthetop
vanilla
seek
this
one
out
overall
easily
one
of
the
most
unique
imperial
stouts
a
great
dessert
beer
always
enjoy
an
opportunity
to
drink
it
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
stouts
on
tap
during
philly
beer
week
at
misconduct
tavern
looks
jet
black
with
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
tastes
just
like
creme
brûlée
the
bartender
even
said
this
one
is
disgustingly
good
i
agree
it
hides
all
the
alcohol
wonderfully
and
almost
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
more
of
a
desert
well
duh
the
only
thing
taking
away
from
this
beer
is
the
overly
sweet
mouthful
besides
that
this
one
is
a
real
treat
overall
if
you
like
big
beers
and
creme
brulee
this
is
for
you
makes
me
crave
that
dessert
now
overall
a
sweet
beer
but
damn
is
it
devilishly
good
o
well
it
certainly
stands
up
to
its
name
its
creme
brulee
in
a
glass
what
more
do
you
want
to
know
very
sweet
almost
sickly
but
not
as
bad
as
something
like
a
jw
lees
o
this
beer
is
beyond
excellent
im
not
sure
how
they
get
away
with
it
as
it
tastes
nothing
of
alcohol
or
even
beer
pure
deliciousness
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
lives
up
to
and
in
some
cases
exceeds
the
hype
i
want
more
a
originally
reviewed
12082010
o
i
find
this
beer
amazing
with
one
condition
it
must
be
shared
a
bomber
of
this
is
too
much
imho
it
is
so
damn
rich
but
the
flavors
are
extremely
well
balanced
would
be
a
fantastic
choice
after
a
nice
steak
this
one
actually
took
first
place
out
of
17
other
random
beers
in
a
family
blind
tasting
in
december
i
find
this
one
more
complex
and
more
well
balanced
that
the
chokolat
overall
another
exceptional
beer
from
southern
tier
it
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
it
to
be
pours
pitch
black
with
no
head
into
my
tulip
glass
smells
just
like
creme
brulee
the
taste
is
just
too
much
syrupy
and
overly
sweet
with
an
artificial
vanilla
aftertaste
more
vanilla
molasses
candy
sugar
vanilla
yikes
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
and
no
need
to
put
it
in
a
22
oz
bottle
would
have
been
fine
with
4
or
5
ounces
just
too
cloyingly
sweet
certainly
unique
though
and
i
would
like
to
pour
this
on
ice
cream
some
time
overall
what
we
found
to
be
the
best
component
of
this
brew
was
how
well
it
represented
both
the
dish
and
the
style
the
nose
was
insanely
sweet
but
perfectly
attuned
to
all
of
the
flavors
with
butter
white
sugar
vanilla
and
a
crispy
char
at
the
same
time
coffee
and
chocolate
flavored
malts
crashed
throughout
giving
a
depth
of
flavor
and
a
seriousness
to
the
palate
the
nose
was
crazy
sweet
and
made
the
drinker
cautious
at
first
but
the
following
sip
was
excitingly
bold
and
fitting
to
the
beer
and
the
desired
flavoring
goals
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
within
the
southern
tier
imperial
stout
series
overall
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
more
weird
than
good
you
could
tell
how
much
sugar
was
in
there
but
it
didnt
quite
make
it
completely
to
the
surface
just
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
sweet
milk
stout
t
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
but
its
still
really
amazing
stuff
big
layers
of
vanilla
and
burnt
brown
sugar
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
with
some
charred
brown
sugar
tastes
like
a
creme
brulee
really
nicely
done
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
and
would
compare
it
to
a
mixed
youngs
chocolate
stout
with
a
left
hand
milk
stout
will
share
my
other
bottle
with
at
least
4
friends
o
a
bit
too
sweet
but
after
all
it
is
a
creme
brulee
exceptionally
smooth
unique
flavor
great
dessert
beer
o
im
sure
for
some
its
too
sweet
as
a
big
fan
of
milk
stouts
i
love
the
sweetness
cremey
sweet
goodness
on
a
nice
bodied
beer
o
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
what
should
be
expected
from
a
beer
named
creme
brûlée
i
suggest
having
at
least
one
other
person
to
share
this
with
because
one
glass
was
enough
for
me
o
its
a
liquid
desert
this
one
could
creep
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
if
youre
not
careful
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
one
finger
fine
medium
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
delicious
crème
brulee
aroma
wafts
out
of
the
bottle
as
this
is
poured
dark
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
vanilla
aroma
smells
delicious
very
sweet
butterscotch
brown
sugar
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
with
a
very
light
hop
kick
at
the
end
very
creamy
and
full
bodied
this
is
a
bit
sweet
but
absolutely
delicious
overall
sweet
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
make
you
think
something
seems
artificial
here
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
my
thing
overall
recommend
buying
treat
yourself
after
dinner
f
your
dessert
this
is
the
real
treat
salud
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
snifter
like
the
bottle
says
to
it
has
a
nice
black
body
with
about
a
1
mocha
colored
head
the
smell
is
fabolous
some
chocolate
and
some
butterscotch
the
taste
is
chocolty
with
vanilla
and
butterscoth
very
sweet
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
defently
a
sipping
beer
cuz
of
the
sweetness
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
this
beer
was
way
too
sweet
for
me
the
aroma
was
over
the
top
and
way
to
candy
like
this
was
a
onetime
try
for
me
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
the
high
abv
and
slight
dark
coffee
taste
keep
the
sweetness
at
bay
enough
to
be
able
to
comfortably
drink
this
definitely
worth
a
try
o
nice
dessert
treat
not
as
good
as
it
warms
but
still
quite
enjoyable
cloying
sweetness
after
a
while
so
make
sure
to
share
overall
i
this
is
a
great
take
on
an
imperial
stout
very
creamy
and
sweet
extremely
drinkable
well
done
southern
tier
well
done
overall
its
enjoyable
expected
it
to
be
sweet
but
was
even
sweet
than
expect
no
way
i
could
have
drank
alot
of
it
rx
a
for
effort
not
so
much
for
execution
i
like
some
of
these
blackwater
beers
but
this
one
is
too
damned
sweet
d
unlike
many
sweeter
high
alcohol
beers
ive
had
this
one
has
a
finish
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
im
not
much
of
a
sweettooth
so
its
quite
surprising
how
much
i
enjoy
this
beer
12
oz
would
be
a
better
serving
as
this
big
beer
does
wear
on
you
but
i
cant
penalize
the
beer
a
bunch
for
that
its
an
absolutely
beautiful
smell
and
an
interesting
thing
to
take
one
mouthful
of
but
im
out
after
that
a
well
executed
double
cream
stout
great
depth
and
balance
good
stuff
overall
nice
for
a
little
bit
but
hard
to
drink
much
of
this
i
certainly
wont
make
it
through
the
whole
bottle
needs
to
be
shared
by
several
people
o
this
was
a
fascinating
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
thought
that
it
worked
for
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
it
i
think
that
the
people
who
have
given
this
a
crazy
low
rating
have
not
taken
into
account
the
style
or
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
with
the
beer
it
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
if
someone
gave
me
some
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
but
i
just
would
not
pay
9
bucks
for
something
that
is
more
of
a
novelty
than
a
regular
sipper
d
in
no
way
shape
or
form
is
this
an
american
doubleimperial
stout
as
listed
and
it
hasnt
been
reviewed
as
such
its
a
milk
stout
strong
and
sweet
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
too
but
excessively
sweet
the
creme
brulee
premise
overwhelms
the
stout
base
instead
of
complementing
it
and
the
vanilla
is
overdone
it
feels
like
a
novelty
but
its
still
worthy
of
serious
consideration
if
youve
got
a
friend
thatd
fancy
splitting
a
bottle
for
dessert
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
novelty
beer
not
one
that
will
make
its
way
into
my
regular
buys
but
ill
probably
get
it
again
for
a
special
occasion
yum
yum
yum
overall
a
really
neat
taste
a
great
dessert
beer
but
just
not
a
lot
of
beer
here
still
worth
seeking
and
checking
out
pours
jet
black
with
a
paperthin
head
that
disapates
almost
instantly
aroma
of
vanilla
heavy
vanilla
but
in
a
nice
way
taste
is
too
much
overly
sweet
thin
for
a
stout
to
thin
for
my
liking
im
sure
some
people
like
this
but
no
one
at
my
table
could
enjoy
it
my
wife
is
going
to
bake
brownies
with
it
i
hope
it
goes
to
good
use
o
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
and
a
hell
of
a
specialty
its
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
in
my
opinion
its
fantastic
for
the
style
but
its
not
for
me
i
can
only
take
it
in
small
small
very
small
doses
way
too
sweet
for
me
i
think
this
may
benefit
from
some
aging
to
take
the
bite
out
of
the
beer
and
meld
flavors
for
a
more
malty
beer
however
i
love
the
burnt
sugar
flavor
that
really
came
through
and
its
a
fantastically
unique
flavor
ruined
by
an
unfortunate
linger
alone
its
not
that
good
however
we
did
mix
with
pumking
for
a
black
and
tan
sort
of
thing
which
was
fairly
good
mix
about
25
creme
brulee
with
about
75
pumking
nice
desert
brew
despite
its
overall
sweetness
and
rich
nature
i
find
this
imperial
stout
very
drinkable
as
a
dessert
beer
or
digestif
another
solid
effort
from
southern
tier
will
go
back
for
more
and
try
mixing
with
a
choklat
do
this
strong
stout
is
a
specialty
beer
dedicated
to
dessert
service
it
has
a
smell
that
is
able
to
conjure
powerful
sensory
images
of
its
namesake
dessert
but
the
other
sensory
qualities
sem
unremarkable
when
considered
alone
one
can
imagine
how
it
might
prove
overpowering
when
unaccompanied
but
it
shows
great
promise
and
flexibility
when
taken
in
the
company
of
sweet
foods
it
measures
up
to
be
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
though
it
is
in
large
part
thanks
to
the
heavenly
smell
o
great
not
the
best
beer
ever
made
but
a
beer
like
nothing
else
ive
had
sooo
sweet
a
overall
simply
not
a
favorite
its
different
for
sure
but
not
a
beer
ill
be
drinking
again
bottom
line
its
too
sweet
not
a
rebuy
feels
full
in
body
moderately
carbonated
and
has
a
mild
warmth
in
the
end
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
opinion
dont
let
the
lighter
mouthfeel
fool
you
this
one
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
because
of
the
high
sweetness
and
extreme
taste
factor
but
it
is
very
close
to
what
the
name
suggests
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
can
finish
an
entire
bomber
myself
but
its
really
a
beer
thats
better
if
you
split
it
overall
not
bad
a
good
winter
beer
for
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
to
enjoy
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
heaviness
associated
with
the
beer
would
drink
again
overall
buying
a
beer
named
creme
brulee
i
was
expecting
sweetness
howeverit
was
little
too
over
powering
for
my
taste
stronger
coffee
or
bitter
chocolate
would
have
added
some
needed
balance
avoid
overall
this
was
overwhelming
recommend
sharing
a
bomber
with
a
minimum
of
4
people
i
will
give
it
some
credit
as
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
true
to
its
name
and
as
advertised
sweet
aftertaste
also
happy
to
be
drinking
a
10oz
snifter
and
no
more
starting
to
get
too
sweet
for
my
palate
towards
the
end
but
no
arguments
did
what
it
said
on
the
tin
o
the
name
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
this
is
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
of
which
i
will
return
my
wife
does
not
even
care
much
for
beer
but
she
loved
it
she
couldnt
hardly
put
the
glass
down
due
to
the
richness
of
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
fairly
low
i
dont
think
i
would
want
much
more
than
a
pint
of
this
beer
in
the
future
i
will
buy
a
bomber
to
split
for
dessert
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
actually
made
it
through
the
entire
sweet
bomber
another
unique
southern
tier
brew
that
exemplifies
all
that
is
good
about
craft
beer
o
im
honestly
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
although
admittedly
im
not
a
connoisseur
of
stouts
this
one
has
so
much
to
offer
not
only
is
the
novelty
flavor
apparent
in
such
a
rewarding
way
but
it
still
can
give
hopheads
something
to
appreciate
too
this
brew
is
so
skillfully
balanced
its
no
surprise
southern
tier
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
nobody
said
that
was
bad
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
deserts
again
this
one
is
worth
a
try
wow
awesome
aroma
for
this
beer
smells
like
butterscotch
caramel
and
vanailla
really
nice
pour
medium
tan
head
flavor
was
very
good
but
got
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
the
vanilla
in
particular
was
a
little
too
overpowering
for
me
bomber
bottle
is
way
too
much
for
me
really
unique
brew
o
this
beer
was
pretty
good
at
first
but
that
ridiculously
heavy
mouthfeel
and
that
exaggerated
cream
flavor
conspire
to
ruin
the
experience
southern
tier
obviously
has
no
problem
creating
big
beers
but
they
seem
to
lack
the
ability
to
consistently
craft
them
with
balance
as
is
creme
brulee
isnt
horrible
but
is
difficult
to
drink
and
tastes
synthetic
other
breweries
do
this
type
of
beer
better
o
unique
and
pretty
tasty
as
a
dessert
beer
not
one
that
youd
want
to
put
back
a
lot
offatigue
sets
in
after
about
6ozbut
it
works
o
no
good
try
but
no
overall
i
was
expecting
an
extreme
beer
and
got
one
but
even
as
a
sweetmilk
stout
this
was
over
the
top
i
admit
drinking
the
whole
bomber
was
way
too
much
maybe
as
a
small
pour
desert
beer
this
could
work
but
i
highly
doubt
id
buy
it
again
its
a
really
interesting
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
as
i
said
earlier
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
bomber
on
my
own
but
this
is
certainly
a
beer
ill
drink
once
or
twice
a
year
once
or
twice
will
be
it
though
i
cant
wait
to
eat
the
brownies
my
girlfriend
is
going
to
make
with
the
other
bottle
o
good
but
fing
sweet
i
think
splitting
this
bomber
4
ways
is
probably
best
a
sipper
and
a
darn
unique
beer
appearance
is
chocolate
brown
almost
black
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
has
some
retention
there
is
definitely
toffee
flavors
in
the
nose
the
initial
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
like
creme
brulee
call
me
captain
obvious
it
is
followed
by
some
dry
roasted
hop
bitterness
that
becomes
more
potent
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
as
expected
caramel
over
the
top
vanilla
sugar
and
burnt
brown
sugar
rounds
things
out
nicely
it
is
sweet
but
not
quite
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
i
love
their
blackwater
series
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
most
of
the
others
finish
is
burnt
and
a
little
bitter
lingers
a
long
time
abv
is
totally
hidden
it
is
dessertlicious
for
sure
but
i
could
drink
this
anytime
including
breakfast
very
nice
delicious
beverage
here
overall
definitely
a
dessert
beer
i
can
see
how
this
is
a
polarizing
beer
but
i
like
it
o
an
amazing
and
really
original
beer
youd
never
guess
its
abv
because
its
such
a
smooth
and
drinkable
brew
o
incredibly
balanced
dessert
beer
with
big
flavors
definitely
a
dessert
beer
but
not
worth
the
effort
o
weirdly
delicious
a
fantastically
unique
brew
glad
i
tired
this
one
i
will
note
that
i
did
not
review
this
beer
to
style
i
reviewed
it
based
on
the
fact
that
it
is
named
creme
brulee
and
judged
it
based
on
how
well
it
held
up
to
its
name
the
beer
tastes
just
how
it
smells
like
a
delicious
creme
brûlée
obviously
very
strong
with
vanilla
and
even
some
hints
of
alcohol
on
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
certainly
a
novelty
beer
but
very
delicious
and
im
excited
about
it
each
year
a
very
drinkable
milk
stout
even
at
the
high
abv
it
would
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
evening
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
unlikely
to
revisit
it
couldnt
finish
more
than
a
snifter
full
because
its
so
syrupy
sweet
cool
attempt
at
a
radical
beer
though
but
hey
its
still
outstanding
and
unbelievable
enough
to
be
drunk
or
rather
sipping
in
the
corner
of
a
good
fire
southern
tier
is
a
brewery
that
either
hits
or
misses
this
is
the
biggest
miss
in
their
lineup
in
fact
it
might
be
the
biggest
miss
ive
ever
had
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
wasted
over
half
the
bottle
the
second
time
i
had
a
sample
pour
given
to
me
at
the
bar
and
had
to
immediately
drink
water
to
get
the
disgusting
taste
out
of
my
mouth
complete
failure
in
my
opinion
o
liked
it
more
than
i
was
expecting
actually
no
way
i
could
drink
a
whole
22
let
alone
a
pint
but
with
a
rich
dessert
this
could
be
really
good
my
wife
wanted
to
try
this
one
so
i
was
happy
to
share
it
with
her
it
pours
like
any
good
imperial
stout
with
a
deep
opaque
brown
color
and
a
modest
ring
of
foam
this
beer
smells
absolutely
incredible
with
an
aroma
of
vanilla
and
caramelized
sugar
that
is
as
close
to
actual
creme
brulee
as
i
can
imagine
the
flavor
is
likewise
dominated
by
vanilla
and
caramel
which
isnt
as
pleasant
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
and
there
is
also
some
earthy
dark
roasted
malts
and
an
undercurrent
of
booze
that
dont
connect
well
with
the
decadent
sweetness
the
texture
is
pleasant
enough
with
a
light
carbonation
to
help
break
up
the
dense
sweet
flavor
profile
in
the
end
though
despite
the
unique
flavor
profile
the
distinctive
potent
sweetness
is
just
too
much
and
i
likely
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
a
nice
beer
that
is
quite
a
treat
however
you
probably
only
want
3
4
or
5
oz
a
solo
pint
might
be
too
over
the
top
nonetheless
quite
an
experience
really
like
the
way
the
crème
brûlée
came
through
great
beer
to
open
and
share
with
23
others
i
was
told
this
beer
would
be
an
explosion
of
sweetness
i
was
told
it
would
be
over
the
top
sugary
sweet
and
more
dessert
than
anything
else
out
there
im
instead
getting
an
ok
beer
with
too
much
vanilla
for
its
own
good
im
not
really
sure
how
to
judge
this
one
there
are
so
many
ways
this
beer
could
really
become
excellent
but
it
just
falls
short
on
all
directions
needs
to
be
thicker
creamier
use
different
hops
and
just
frankly
different
o
a
am
so
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
one
out
i
am
not
dissapointed
i
am
planning
to
go
back
and
grab
a
few
more
bottles
to
cellar
one
of
the
best
sweet
stouts
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
this
year
instantly
to
my
top
10
list
love
it
im
a
fan
of
southern
tier
crème
brûlée
and
proud
to
admit
it
dont
like
it
because
you
think
its
too
sweet
good
more
for
the
rest
of
us
afraid
to
buy
a
bomber
in
fear
that
it
may
give
you
diabeetus
good
more
for
the
rest
of
us
the
taste
matches
the
nose
butterscotch
up
front
extremely
sweet
beer
almost
too
sweet
i
give
this
a
high
rating
because
it
is
delicious
however
it
should
be
noted
that
i
can
only
really
have
this
in
about
a
6oz
portion
anymore
and
it
is
too
much
perfect
to
split
a
bottle
between
a
couple
of
friends
great
dessert
beer
southern
tier
has
really
impressed
me
lately
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
its
a
dark
fully
black
thick
liquid
with
a
dense
tan
head
really
remarkable
exceptional
really
is
the
aroma
the
sweet
dessertlike
aroma
is
unlike
almost
any
other
beer
i
was
afraid
that
the
aroma
would
be
artificial
with
too
much
vanilla
but
somehow
this
strikes
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
creamy
maltedmilk
qualiities
of
a
milk
stout
and
huge
proportions
of
vanilla
its
intense
sensegrabbing
and
fantastic
i
love
it
its
like
a
chocolate
malt
woodyvanilla
and
cream
pie
creme
brulee
indeed
some
toasty
roasty
scents
are
present
as
well
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
get
a
kick
out
of
just
sniffing
the
flavor
is
strong
with
a
firm
bitterness
that
provides
some
balance
sweet
on
the
lips
thick
and
intense
but
not
cloying
huge
hefty
body
spectacularly
satisfying
too
sweet
really
for
anything
other
then
a
desert
sipper
but
this
beer
would
work
good
in
desert
recipes
too
i
think
this
would
make
a
fantastic
ice
cream
too
o
they
dont
call
it
creme
brulee
for
nothing
this
is
more
of
a
novelty
stout
imho
and
very
artificial
tasting
o
good
overall
i
liked
the
smell
a
lot
but
thought
it
could
use
a
bit
less
carbonation
d
i
generally
avoid
reviewing
st
because
they
are
so
hit
or
miss
this
beer
continues
the
trend
of
intense
fun
and
inviting
aroma
but
falling
short
in
taste
ive
never
actually
ate
crème
brulee
but
a
few
of
my
friends
claimed
that
this
beer
is
truly
onpar
with
the
food
so
take
that
for
what
its
worth
overall
truly
enjoy
this
beer
everytime
i
have
it
a
must
share
beer
very
hard
to
finish
a
bottle
by
urself
becomes
pretty
overwelmingly
sweet
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
cheers
o
a
very
complex
beer
indeed
the
only
advice
i
offer
is
to
share
it
with
at
least
4
to
5
people
because
even
a
little
more
than
a
few
ounces
will
make
it
unpleasant
great
if
your
a
fan
of
sweet
beer
beer
would
pair
well
with
thanksgivingchristmas
desert
overall
ok
would
i
want
to
have
this
everyday
no
is
it
an
ideal
dessert
beer
yes
if
you
willingly
drink

called

not
a
bad
beer
a
little
sweet
for
myself
but
definitely
a
desert
beer
that
is
tasty
especially
on
a
cold
fallor
winter
night
prefer
the
mocha
to
this
one
all
day
o
this
beer
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
great
ill
defiantly
be
buying
it
again
but
not
in
bulk
d
overall
this
was
better
than
i
expected
not
as
thick
and
rich
as
i
had
been
told
and
anticipated
the
creme
brulee
is
a
nice
touch
but
not
overpowering
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
finsh
this
entire
22oz
by
myself
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
dessert
beer
it
is
called
creme
brulee
and
it
delivers
enjoy
notes
i
was
skeptical
about
this
beer
at
first
because
i
found
choklat
to
be
highly
overrated
this
one
is
different
its
a
sweet
beer
but
not
overly
so
that
it
resembles
liquid
candy
the
only
complaint
that
i
have
is
that
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
and
has
a
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
overall
quite
tasty
truly
dessert
in
a
glass
very
rich
and
sweet
small
light
brown
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
dark
brownblack
color
tastes
of
caramel
vanilla
and
burnt
chocolate
smells
amazing
tastes
almost
as
good
burnt
taste
lingers
a
little
like
i
said
a
bit
rich
but
still
a
delicious
sipper
overall
rich
and
delicious
cloying
and
sweet
a
definite
desert
sipper
to
share
overall
this
is
straightforward
very
sweet
pretty
good
22
oz
of
this
got
a
to
be
alot
thats
not
to
say
that
everyone
is
going
to
like
this
beer
it
packs
and
alcoholic
wallop
and
the
flavor
will
be
offsetting
to
many
while
this
isnt
the
best
brew
that
ive
had
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
there
isnt
anything
else
on
the
shelf
today
thats
remotely
like
this
for
anyone
who
doubts
that
beer
tastes
like
bitter
hops
and
water
this
will
challenge
that
notion
pretty
strongly
everyone
should
give
this
a
sample
once
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
see
whats
possible
and
expand
hisher
palate
this
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
experienced
definitely
a
dessert
beer
it
tastes
like
dessert
i
cant
really
decide
whether
i
like
it
or
not
and
i
go
back
and
forth
depending
on
my
mood
i
could
easily
give
this
an
a
or
a
c
right
now
im
finding
it
overwhelming
but
dang
its
interesting
overall
not
bad
but
a
little
to
much
with
the
alcohol
this
is
to
be
a
dessert
beer
but
its
really
intense
i
still
prefer
there
chocolate
stout
to
this
its
not
so
sugary
sweet
and
more
stout
flavored
also
i
wish
this
was
in
12
oz
bottles
cause
for
me
this
22oz
is
a
chore
to
finish
overall
when
looking
for
a
sweet
bomb
dessert
beer
this
is
an
excellent
choice
my
rating
of
3
5
reflects
the
fact
that
after
a
bomber
of
this
you
wont
likely
be
reaching
for
another
in
the
next
few
months
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
12
ounce
bottles
to
make
it
a
less
overwhelming
experience
o
this
is
a
dessert
beer
dream
very
sweet
so
i
dont
think
it
would
be
more
than
a
glass
unless
its
really
your
thing
also
due
to
high
alcohol
butterscotch
flavors
and
high
alcohol
content
also
make
it
reminiscent
of
a
liquor
so
this
also
docks
its
drinkablity
for
me
had
a
nice
lambic
type
ale
after
and
it
was
a
good
beer
set
for
the
night
an
enjoyable
draft
treat
overall
a
phenomenal
dessertbeer
hybrid
that
is
just
begging
for
some
aging
if
its
this
delicious
now
i
can
only
imagine
what
a
year
or
so
would
do
to
mellow
out
the
overly
sugary
sweetness
and
alcohol
burn
that
hold
this
beer
back
poured
thick
black
with
a
huge
khaki
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smelled
of
vanilla
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
maybe
taste
was
vanilla
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
heat
from
alochol
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
bubbly
from
carbonation
overall
i
thick
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
do
this
some
good
my
throat
burned
from
too
much
sugars
and
booze
overall
too
sweet
for
me
pleanty
strong
as
all
the
other
blackwater
souther
tiers
are
but
this
just
wasnt
my
favorite
of
them
all
amazing
worth
trying
o
great
beer
and
i
think
this
would
do
well
with
about
6
months
or
so
of
age
on
it
might
round
out
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
a
little
o
for
those
of
you
that
dont
dig
sweet
imperial
stouts
i
understand
but
please
quit
buying
up
this
beautiful
brew
so
that
i
can
get
your
share
i
only
wish
they
would
barrel
age
some
of
this
fantastic
brew
i
know
for
a
fact
this
one
gets
better
with
age
as
ive
had
it
with
a
few
years
on
it
but
it
is
unreal
fresh
as
well
pour
this
over
some
cherry
or
strawberry
ice
cream
for
the
best
float
youve
ever
had
im
gonna
get
a
couple
bottles
of
this
and
get
it
flat
and
make
ice
pops
out
of
it
on
the
tongue
all
of
the
flavors
noted
in
the
nose
are
present
in
great
strength
but
are
joined
by
a
torrential
onslaught
of
toffee
and
milk
chocolate
with
strong
currents
of
tobacco
and
chocolate
malt
the
vanilla
beans
are
especially
strong
on
the
tastebuds
as
well
as
are
the
flambeed
marshmallows
i
can
neither
fathom
nor
adequately
describe
the
amount
of
sugar
in
the
brew
nor
can
i
stress
enough
that
this
tastes
nothing
like
beer
ive
tried
dozens
of
beersthattastelikesomethingelse
but
none
have
been
so
complete
and
delicious
as
this
no
doubt
some
will
criticize
this
stout
for
not
tasting
like
beer
but
i
think
its
marvelous
but
beware
this
brew
is
so
sugary
that
you
might
not
be
able
to
finish
it
in
one
sittingand
at
10
abv
you
might
not
want
to
try
anyway
instead
split
it
with
a
loved
one
over
dessert
overall
on
taste
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
also
in
taste
not
as
sweet
i
thought
it
would
be
and
didnt
come
out
as
a
big
sugar
blast
however
there
is
an
unpleasant
almost
acrid
and
strange
hop
bitter
to
this
that
doesnt
make
the
drink
particularly
enjoyable
the
intoxicating
and
inviting
aromas
of
south
tier
creme
brulee
stout
draw
you
in
the
second
you
pop
the
top
tons
of
toffee
butterscotch
and
milk
in
the
nose
and
a
gorgeous
dark
tan
head
floating
on
a
sea
of
black
sweet
sugar
with
a
little
bit
of
char
to
go
along
with
the
butterscotch
and
warm
milk
and
a
very
creamy
texture
theres
also
a
hop
bite
at
the
back
end
to
remind
you
its
a
beer
never
having
had
creme
brulee
i
know
how
bourgeois
of
me
i
cant
say
how
close
it
is
to
creme
brulee
in
a
bottle
but
gosh
is
it
tasty
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
think
its
delicious
the
burnt
flavor
lingers
more
than
anything
but
it
goes
very
well
with
the
sweetness
not
even
a
hint
of
the
whopping
9
6
abv
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
that
is
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
it
is
blended
too
sweet
even
for
a
desert
type
beer
the
balance
is
off
in
all
aspects
other
than
appearance
o
its
different
very
strong
vanilla
and
butterscotch
aroma
and
flavors
o
the
smell
is
intoxicating
the
first
sip
is
delicious
its
just
too
much
dessert
in
a
glass
od
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
love
the
sweetness
that
being
said
you
can
only
do
half
a
bottle
to
yourself
have
a
bite
to
eat
and
split
this
big
beer
for
dessert
with
someone
you
like
the
overall
go
buy
a
case
o
i
must
say
never
been
a
fan
of
southern
tier
but
all
the
black
water
series
arehave
been
delicious
two
thumbs
up
saving
another
for
winter
side
notes
probably
will
be
much
better
with
age
going
to
buy
one
or
two
more
to
age
o
this
brew
definitely
has
potential
with
some
age
it
is
descently
drinkable
but
like
i
said
its
a
little
hot
right
now
id
prefer
the
javah
from
st
im
going
to
come
back
and
review
this
again
in
a
few
months
to
a
year
to
see
how
it
improves
with
age
because
i
feel
like
it
would
improve
greatly
o
this
really
truly
is
the
definition
of
a
dessert
beersweet
stout
the
flavors
are
tremendous
the
booziness
brings
you
back
to
the
fact
it
is
alcohol
and
not
really
dessert
its
quite
good
but
the
sweetness
would
get
to
you
after
a
while
considering
the
name
there
is
no
misleading
marketing
here
this
is
creme
brulee
with
alcohol
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
and
crosses
up
with
the
flavors
quite
a
bit
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
light
crimson
highlights
and
a
thin
wispy
tan
head
spotty
random
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
snifter
the
aroma
wow
one
can
detect
this
beer
from
several
feet
away
huge
aroma
of
coconut
flan
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
the
label
speaks
truth
this
is
creme
brulee
good
flavor
though
less
enjoyable
than
the
aroma
booze
is
prevalent
throughout
sweet
and
rich
this
brew
is
akin
to
a
gourmet
dessert
a
small
portion
is
perfect
honestly
this
is
an
intriguing
and
creative
beer
well
worth
trying
o
yum
yum
4
5
well
i
have
no
reason
to
lie
i
love
this
beer
im
a
big
vanilla
bean
fan
though
so
if
youre
not
a
vanilla
person
you
should
skip
this
i
for
one
wish
this
was
available
all
the
time
as
i
have
a
hard
enough
time
finding
the
vanilla
beers
i
lust
after
this
is
well
made
and
makes
a
delicious
desert
or
sweet
snack
beer
just
look
out
for
the
abv
next
time
i
get
a
bottle
of
this
beer
floats
are
definitely
happening
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
for
it
than
this
one
o
first
try
of
this
and
i
am
extremely
impressed
this
is
a
clone
of
a
real
crème
brulee
it
is
just
a
rich
and
creamy
brew
but
not
too
sweet
glad
i
bought
a
few
amazing
beer
i
need
to
get
some
more
on
tap
major
improvement
from
when
i
had
it
in
a
bottle
again
poured
a
thick
chocolate
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
retained
for
a
little
while
but
almost
disappeared
middrink
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
nose
cream
and
dark
malts
unlike
the
bottle
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
more
and
was
more
enjoyable
with
almost
no
aftertaste
it
tasted
sweet
and
creamy
and
well
like
creme
brulee
as
the
name
would
imply
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
and
nicely
drinkable
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
taste
is
damn
good
nice
switch
from
you
normal
american
doubleits
like
a
dessert
great
for
after
dinner
i
would
reccommend
splitting
with
a
buddy
this
has
got
to
be
my
absolute
favorite
southern
tier
release
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
very
thick
black
goop
that
lets
off
a
thick
creamy
brown
head
on
it
the
smell
is
unreal
the
burnt
sugar
aroma
mixed
to
perfect
with
the
sweet
vanilla
extract
smell
my
nose
could
stay
in
the
glass
all
day
on
this
one
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
roasted
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
that
is
supposed
to
resemble
another
food
of
somekind
the
mouthfeel
is
a
slippery
and
thick
worth
while
for
a
long
night
of
sipping
from
a
snifter
glass
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
know
a
ton
of
people
dont
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
gem
really
want
to
get
this
one
ontap
someday
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
small
12
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
amounts
of
lacing
slide
back
down
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
on
the
drink
down
smells
exactly
like
creme
brulee
very
sweet
milk
vanilla
and
caramelized
sugar
aromas
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
i
was
expecting
up
front
there
is
a
pretty
bitter
roasted
malt
taste
that
develops
into
a
sweet
cream
vanilla
and
caramelized
sugar
aftertaste
the
bitterness
fades
after
each
sip
leaving
the
creme
brulee
flavors
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
definitely
less
sweet
than
it
smells
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
creamy
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
smells
and
tastes
very
similar
to
the
creme
brulee
dessert
i
split
this
one
with
my
wife
and
she
absolutely
loved
it
this
and
the
choklat
are
the
best
st
black
water
series
beers
that
i
have
tried
taste
follows
the
nose
it
is
really
sweet
this
is
an
after
dinner
beer
not
one
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
sip
it
and
enjoy
the
dessert
o
this
is
nearly
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
and
even
though
this
is
true
the
large
format
would
limit
me
to
enjoying
one
bottle
every
now
and
then
its
so
rich
and
sweet
that
its
something
that
needs
to
be
shared
really
and
really
fills
me
up
however
from
a
creative
standpoint
this
is
imo
one
of
the
best
products
to
be
found
anywhere
and
i
absolutely
love
it
perfect
dessert
beer
southern
tier
rocks
and
this
is
best
in
genre
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
think
i
would
get
over
the
sweet
flavor
really
quick
but
after
3
im
sure
your
senses
would
dull
since
this
bad
boy
is
10
abv
great
beer
nonbeer
drinking
women
would
maul
a
baby
panda
to
try
this
beer
again
o
delicious
this
is
probably
the
best
dessert
beer
i
have
had
i
had
this
on
top
last
summer
for
the
first
time
and
fell
in
love
i
dont
think
id
pound
it
all
night
but
a
couple
of
these
guys
really
caps
off
a
meal
o
wish
i
split
this
not
super
drinkable
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
lets
on
overall
this
one
is
really
interesting
and
pretty
much
nails
a
creme
brulee
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
or
want
often
but
great
to
have
every
now
and
then
finish
some
dryness
and
loss
of
complexity
this
beer
is
all
as
until
you
get
to
this
point
the
sweetness
kinda
goes
away
all
the
flavor
seems
to
have
disappeared
kinda
of
a
let
down
but
still
better
than
most
stouts
on
the
market
doverall
this
beer
has
soo
many
things
good
going
for
it
it
looked
great
smelled
great
but
did
not
taste
great
it
was
just
way
too
sweet
im
glad
i
opened
this
between
4
people
or
i
would
of
never
been
able
to
finish
it
i
think
next
time
they
should
only
add
2
pounds
of
sugar
to
the
batch
instead
of
20
im
excited
to
try
other
stuff
from
them
but
this
was
too
much
i
can
sip
on
about
8
oz
or
so
of
this
but
then
im
done
creme
brulee
imperial
milk
stout
is
an
excellent
dessert
beer
not
a
session
beer
at
all
ive
only
seen
this
available
in
large
pint
bottles
and
is
a
seasonal
summer
release
brewed
by
the
wonderfully
creative
folks
at
southern
tier
pours
a
dark
brown
with
decent
clarity
and
a
negligible
head
the
smellnose
is
incredible
the
second
you
pour
this
your
slapped
in
the
face
with
overwhelming
aromas
of
real
vanilla
beans
a
first
sip
confirms
what
you
smell
and
the
back
notes
are
full
of
toffee
java
and
roasted
nuts
the
mouth
feel
is
very
common
of
other
milk
stouts
creamy
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
the
only
downfall
to
this
is
that
it
is
overwhelming
after
a
whileas
any
real
creme
brulee
is
if
you
like
vanilla
and
good
coffee
i
highly
recommend
this
i
also
recommend
that
you
split
it
with
some
friends
as
the
abv
is
around
10
and
finishing
a
whole
pint
yourself
will
leave
you
feeling
a
little
gluttonous

i
hate
sweet
beers
this
is
a
sweet
one
this
is
dessert
i
knew
it
coming
in
and
i
love
creme
brulee
so
i
enjoyed
this
one
can
you
really
call
this
a
bear
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
eat
the
real
thing
overthetop
with
the
sweetsyrupyburnt
sugar
theme
lacks
sufficient
balance
to
make
a
drinkable
beer
good
for
small
sips
but
serving
this
in
a
bomber
seems
to
be
beyond
overkill
overall
a
desert
turned
into
a
beer
and
it
lives
up
to
its
name
very
sweet
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palette
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
butterscotch
smells
and
tastes
as
well
i
was
impressed
as
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
just
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
because
the
name
caught
my
eye
a
very
good
stout
from
southern
tier
that
delivers
on
all
fronts
d
this
is
a
great
imperial
milk
stout
if
youre
into
sweet
beers
the
taste
and
the
aroma
dont
match
up
perfectly
but
it
is
still
a
great
experience
i
say
you
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
try
it
out
mouthed
malted
milk
balls
bitterness
from
the
chocolate
and
i
would
guess
the
hops
there
may
b
vanilla
beans
up
in
this
beer
but
the
butterscotch
hides
it
a
great
beer
but
not
one
to
be
drinking
multiple
bottles
of
however
even
if
youre
looking
for
creme
brulee
this
one
is
a
sipper
and
its
hard
to
get
through
more
than
a
few
ounces
share
the
bomber
overall
this
stout
is
no
doubt
a
dessert
beer
through
and
through
it
is
very
difficult
imagining
drinking
more
then
one
pint
in
a
row
however
as
a
dessert
beer
it
does
the
job
exquisitely
i
would
certainly
reccomend
this
brew
to
others
as
a
dessert
beer
only
to
those
who
do
not
like
sweet
brews
keep
your
distance
i
wouldve
scored
this
brew
higher
if
it
werent
so
one
dimensional
862010
o
sooo
sweet
definitely
needs
something
to
counter
balance
the
profile
like
a
big
blue
cheese
pretzels
salted
nuts
or
a
spicy
asian
snack
mix
dangerously
drinkable
sweet
for
sure
would
go
great
with
some
type
of
semisweet
chocolate
dessert
fantastic
very
unique
loved
it
drinkability
a
bomber
might
be
good
enough
while
it
is
delicious
and
i
would
recommend
for
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
22
oz
is
enough
for
one
sitting
drank
nicely
to
the
finish
with
a
nice
lace
down
the
glass
d
sweetness
makes
it
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
more
than
just
a
few
ounces
given
that
this
one
comes
in
a
bomber
i
definitely
have
to
share
this
one
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
it
is
not
overbearingly
sweet
like
some
beers
i
almost
did
not
buy
this
because
i
though
it
would
be
far
too
sweet
i
am
very
glad
i
bought
this
beer
it
is
amazing
how
southern
tier
made
this
beer
taste
just
like
crème
brulee
this
beer
is
an
experience
and
one
they
would
do
well
to
offer
in
smaller
bottles
drinkafrickinbility
ha
this
brew
is
10
abv
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
thats
an
underestimate
both
me
and
my
bro
agree
that
this
brew
is
something
to
keep
around
for
life
its
very
drinkable
at
10
abv
not
to
say
its
a
great
sessions
beer
but
this
could
definitely
be
a
night
cap
dessert
black
with
big
creamy
head
smells
delightful
creamy
sweet
sugary
a
little
too
sweet
and
thick
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
chocolatey
tough
to
get
down
on
no
alcohol
to
this
big
beer
dominated
by
the
thick
sweetness
drinkability
super
nice
just
like
the
mouthfeel
well
balanced
never
overwhelming
despite
the
fairly
onedimensionality
of
the
body
pure
joy
this
is
a
dessert
beer
if
ive
ever
had
one
and
ill
rate
the
drinkability
accordingly
ie
as
a
dessert
beer
way
too
sweet
to
be
a
regular
drinker
but
definitely
worthy
of
being
pulled
out
occasionally
after
a
dinner
with
friends
bonus
points
for
mostly
living
up
to
the
name
i
couldnt
imagine
a
beer
called
creme
brule
being
much
more
appropriate
than
this
one
a
little
too
sweet
its
a
good
sipping
beer
perfect
for
dessert
or
a
nightcap
in
all
an
interesting
one
to
taste
but
cant
imagine
going
into
this
looking
to
do
more
than
that
cant
recommend
a
purchase
but
if
someone
offers
you
some
give
it
a
smell
and
decide
if
its
for
you
for
the
record
my
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
which
saved
having
to
pour
it
down
the
drain
now
this
is
a
tasty
beer
the
smell
will
knock
you
right
out
of
your
socks
as
well
as
satisfy
the
sweet
tooth
i
have
actually
added
a
scoop
of
bryers
ice
cream
to
this
for
a
beer
float
it
is
very
thick
and
high
in
alcohol
so
maybe
only
two
or
three
will
satisfy
i
recommend
this
to
all
women
stout
drinkers
of
the
world
d
i
bought
this
beer
based
mainly
out
of
curiosity
ive
had
the
choklat
before
and
i
thought
that
was
the
tastiest
beer
ive
ever
had
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
as
well
and
i
may
try
it
again
sooner
or
later
overall
i
really
do
like
the
blackwater
series
from
southern
tier
i
will
keep
trying
the
blackwater
series
i
am
a
fan
of
southern
tier
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
from
southern
tier
taste
was
almost
a
4
5
but
the
harsh
and
overly
bitter
finish
detracted
it
a
bit
unfortunately
drinkability
maybe
something
that
should
be
sold
in
24
oz
increments
as
a
curiosity
could
never
use
this
as
a
session
beer
d
low
drinkability
i
taste
alchohol
on
my
breath
now
and
my
stomach
is
full
a
22
oz
is
good
for
a
night
overall
very
strange
brew
but
very
impressive
offering
im
impressed
by
southern
tiers
creativity
and
how
well
crafted
this
beer
is
d
drinking
this
beer
is
practically
like
having
dessert
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
theres
not
a
trace
of
the
alcohol
content
in
the
smell
and
taste
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
an
addicting
amount
of
vanilla
with
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
the
taste
wasnt
as
great
as
the
aroma
but
was
still
very
enjoyable
it
wasnt
too
sweet
but
had
an
incredible
vanilla
creamy
flavor
to
it
it
was
also
very
drinkable
considering
the
style
and
the
alcohol
content
i
wish
they
would
make
a
cologne
or
a
candle
or
something
so
i
could
smell
this
beers
aroma
all
the
time
this
was
a
phenominal
beer
im
really
starting
to
love
how
over
the
top
many
of
souther
tiers
beers
are
the
pumpking
pushed
the
boundaries
of
how
pumpkin
a
pumpkin
beer
can
be
and
this
beer
does
the
same
for
a
beer
with
vanilla
id
highly
recommend
this
d
not
very
good
took
me
a
while
to
put
down
one
glass
i
dont
consider
myself
as
being
able
to
explain
everything
i
taste
and
smell
when
i
drink
a
beer
but
i
would
recommend
any
beer
drinker
give
this
one
a
go
overall
an
excellent
and
very
original
stout
not
something
you
could
drink
a
lot
off
but
highly
recommended
dvery
sweet
but
not
sweet
to
the
point
of
no
longer
drinkable
hides
the
10
abv
very
well
da
little
too
sweet
and
cloying
to
be
anything
other
than
a
slowsippingsplit
a
bomber
for
dessertone
and
done
d
wow
no
not
more
than
a
glass
sugars
and
abv
will
get
to
ya
i
am
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
at
all
but
this
is
amazing
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
cheers
drinkability
there
is
no
way
i
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
its
rich
and
very
deep
in
flavour
glad
i
tried
it
but
thats
where
it
ends
d
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
offering
some
very
unique
flavours
that
being
said
its
a
little
too
much
for
one
person
and
i
suspect
it
wouldve
been
more
enjoyable
to
split
this
one
definitely
a
dessert
beer
d
just
like
the
entire
black
water
series
from
st
this
one
is
a
dessert
beer
that
should
be
sipped
because
of
the
sweetness
and
fairly
high
abv
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
so
a
whole
bomber
is
no
problem
for
me
although
i
can
see
where
the
sweetness
would
be
a
problem
for
many
no
no
no
both
too
bitter
and
too
sweet
yuk
no
balance
of
flavours
tastes
like
sweet
stout
with
butterscotch
syrup
added
afterwards
a
fake
its
definitely
10
though
try
innis
and
gunn
oakaged
if
you
like
the
vanilla
undertones
without
the
sickly
cloying
fakeness
overall
an
impressive
beer
but
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
im
inclined
to
use
it
in
place
of
port
at
the
end
of
a
meal
im
not
certain
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
i
will
sleep
better
tonight
knowing
that
such
flavour
artistry
is
available
and
relatively
widely
accessible
this
is
a
beer
i
cannot
get
into
i
was
so
pumped
when
it
came
out
i
drove
to
the
brewery
and
found
that
it
was
the
worst
tasting
beer
at
soutern
tier
it
tasted
so
fake
like
they
used
some
real
cheap
off
flacoring
to
give
it
that
sweet
taste
and
it
was
more
vanilla
tasting
than
i
thought
it
should
be
it
does
look
nice
and
smell
pretty
good
but
it
end
there
overall
a
unique
stout
very
flavorful
and
with
great
mouthfeel
a
must
try
considering
the
high
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
it
is
a
unique
beer
taste
this
is
the
quintessential
dessert
beer
so
rich
so
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
that
it
is
a
turnoff
tons
of
vanilla
all
over
this
took
out
some
vanilla
ice
cream
threw
some
of
this
on
it
even
better
just
awesome
very
unique
very
different
this
is
like
drinking
a
cookie
its
my
favorite
dessert
beer
ill
definitely
be
trying
it
again
its
got
everything
you
want
in
a
dessert
stout
lots
of
vanilla
thick
sturdy
malt
bill
espressocoffee
lightness
overall
this
is
an
interesting
novelty
beer
the
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
level
make
this
a
beer
to
savor
its
too
sweet
to
be
a
regular
drinker
though
a
true
luxury
i
think
the
mokah
is
the
best
in
this
series
but
for
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
its
hard
to
fault
d
ive
had
this
a
few
times
always
split
at
least
4
ways
i
feel
thats
a
perfect
serving
size
for
this
beer
any
more
an
id
probably
get
sick
obviously
meant
to
be
a
dessert
beer
paired
great
with
the
creme
caramel
wow
a
novelty
for
sure
and
many
will
probably
be
turned
off
by
its
overly
sweet
flavor
profile
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
at
least
try
one
time
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
dessert
beer
if
you
serve
this
after
a
meal
all
by
itself
i
would
gladly
accept
that
as
a
pleasant
way
to
wrap
up
a
delicious
meal
especially
in
the
presence
of
good
company
with
whom
i
could
share
this
bottle
d
nice
very
beautiful
nose
otherwise
a
bit
plain
on
the
dry
side
great
novelty
beer
chicks
probably
dig
it
buying
more
of
this
one
this
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
blackwater
beers
ive
had
from
st
not
overly
sweet
like
the
choklat
got
and
not
overly
bitter
like
the
mokah
got
to
be
and
it
smells
like
cookie
dough
as
you
drink
it
bonus
pours
black
with
a
tan
foam
head
the
nose
is
very
sweet
vanilla
caramel
toffee
cream
candy
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
heavy
vanuilla
toffee
flavours
sugary
mildly
bitter
finish
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
very
sweet
an
extreme
variation
on
a
stout
not
a
revist
for
me
flavors
become
more
intense
as
it
warms
might
be
a
tad
overkill
for
some
as
the
sweetness
and
high
abv
hurt
drinkability
however
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
drink
i
wasnt
dissapointed
which
is
great
some
people
will
love
this
some
wont
this
deserves
to
be
tried
as
something
different
that
i
think
people
will
come
to
appreciate
now
to
trade
for
another
one
pours
black
with
a
finger
or
two
of
khaki
head
mild
retention
sticky
lace
nose
is
huge
loads
of
graham
cracker
burnt
sugar
pie
crustpastry
crust
and
vanilla
with
some
alcohol
hanging
out
in
the
back
taste
is
fairly
complex
lots
of
stuff
thrown
together
here
caramel
sweet
creme
brulee
dark
chocolate
burnt
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
all
find
their
way
in
there
with
some
alcohol
on
the
back
end
great
mouthfeel
thick
and
real
chewy
drinkability
takes
a
hit
this
is
super
sweet
and
a
real
dessert
beer
half
a
bomber
was
more
than
enough
almost
too
much
for
me
interesting
stuff
and
really
gives
the
impression
of
some
creme
brulee
cheers
creme
brulee
stout
was
a
major
disappointment
ive
liked
everything
else
ive
tried
from
southern
tier
but
they
missed
the
boat
on
this
one
it
could
be
a
winner
if
they
toned
down
the
over
the
top
amount
of
vanilla
m
thick
and
smooth
and
creamy
quite
good
medium
to
heavy
bodied
mouthfeel
a
little
below
average
carbonation
for
reasons
already
stated
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
hugely
drinkable
brew
the
10
can
really
be
felt
though
its
not
noticeable
thats
really
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
tastes
on
par
with
the
smell
sweet
syruppy
and
delicious
no
alcohol
taste
but
a
great
warming
from
the
10
kicks
in
quickly
pours
a
nearly
jet
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
dissolved
rather
quickly
leaving
a
few
tan
spots
in
the
corners
of
the
glass
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
to
die
for
tons
of
burnt
cream
vanilla
caramel
slight
chocolate
and
a
faint
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
exactly
like
creme
brulee
cream
and
vanilla
are
right
up
front
a
little
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
there
were
points
where
i
picked
up
a
little
coffee
and
a
chocolate
caramel
flavor
but
that
came
and
went
creamy
mouthfeel
i
did
think
it
would
be
a
little
thicker
though
great
desert
stout
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
but
1
a
month
or
so
would
be
fantastic
my
favorite
of
the
blackwater
series
so
far
d
delicious
and
goes
down
really
smoothly
will
be
even
better
in
6
months
to
a
year
so
i
guess
im
on
the
lookout
for
another
couple
of
bottles
a
vibrant
sweet
smell
and
desertlike
taste
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
pack
pours
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
expected
with
a
head
which
disappears
very
quickly
im
a
fan
of
vanilla
so
this
beer
really
went
down
well
can
also
taste
caramel
and
maybe
even
a
little
coffee
not
sure
if
a
beer
float
has
been
invented
but
this
would
be
the
beer
to
use
pours
a
three
finger
pillowy
light
tan
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
some
lace
black
color
no
highlights
nose
is
very
sweet
crème
brûlée
good
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
flavor
is
crème
brûlée
and
some
coffee
very
balanced
thought
it
would
be
cloying
it
isnt
would
go
good
with
chocolate
9
00
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
this
is
definitely
not
a
sixpack
beer
it
would
go
great
with
rich
holiday
meals
or
with
desserts
or
as
a
dessert
d
love
this
beer
def
in
my
top
10
at
the
moment
surprised
by
the
hops
but
it
fits
well
i
will
be
getting
this
again
soon
smooth
rich
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
light
effervescence
an
amazing
root
beercaramelized
sugar
aftertaste
a
subrle
warming
this
is
truly
dessert
in
a
glass
an
amazing
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
flavors
are
certainly
in
line
with
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
southern
tiers
blackwater
series
these
stouts
are
stouts
that
are
highly
flavored
that
push
the
limits
of
what
i
am
comfortable
with
enjoying
but
are
fairly
decent
intro
beers
for
people
to
try
that
might
not
necessarily
enjoy
dark
beers
d
this
is
a
dessert
beer
that
has
to
be
sipped
so
drinkability
is
ok
also
due
to
it
being
extremely
sweet
one
glass
should
be
enough
overall
amazing
what
st
does
with
their
specialty
beers
this
is
no
exception
a
great
sipper
to
be
shared
with
friends
in
small
quantities
next
time
skip
the
dessert
and
grab
a
glass
of
creme
brulee
you
will
enjoy
it
taste
nice
mix
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
for
a
stout
at
10
it
goes
down
very
smooth
but
more
than
a
glass
would
be
too
much
a
tasty
dessert
very
which
went
very
well
with
vanilla
ice
cream
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
it
smells
like
creme
brulee
and
tastes
like
creme
brulee
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
desert
are
too
overpowering
for
me
to
actually
sit
and
enjoy
the
beer
i
like
flavor
in
my
beers
but
not
this
much
flavor
like
drinking
a
beer
custard
the
last
10
ounces
were
a
real
battle
very
filling
tasty
but
way
too
sweet
for
me
d
ok
annoyingly
cloyingly
sweet
d
i
believe
i
have
just
found
my
new
favourite
stout
so
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
or
sip
i
just
dont
know
about
this
maybe
as
an
apertif
but
its
still
a
little
too
imbalanced
to
truly
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
dvery
ive
purchased
this
many
times
and
i
always
enjoy
every
bit
of
it
the
taste
stays
extremely
well
abv
does
hit
sorta
quickly
tho
overall
i
liked
it
but
price
is
a
bit
steep
yet
i
will
most
likely
buy
another
pours
black
with
a
slight
mocha
head
the
nose
is
really
quite
extremeeven
for
this
seriesas
it
brings
forward
loads
of
sweet
cream
and
vanilla
along
with
burnt
sugar
in
the
back
are
some
roasted
malts
coffee
and
light
chocolate
flavors
the
taste
really
brings
the
sweetness
forward
and
it
gets
to
be
quite
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
sets
in
toward
the
end
i
would
really
have
a
difficult
time
drinking
more
than
4oz
or
so
of
this
though
the
nose
is
incredible
this
beer
smells
absolutely
amazing
once
the
cap
is
off
it
pours
a
nice
dark
stout
body
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
on
this
is
that
of
butterscotch
also
in
the
nose
are
some
notes
of
booze
and
even
some
roasted
notes
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
is
really
overtaken
by
the
aroma
very
good
smooth
stout
however
it
becomes
more
harsh
as
it
heats
up
definitely
serving
it
at
42
like
described
is
a
good
idea
the
overall
taste
on
this
beer
is
classic
stout
some
hops
loads
of
malt
and
some
cream
however
the
real
thing
here
is
the
aroma
not
a
beer
to
drink
quickly
or
often
but
a
nice
winter
warmer
when
the
snow
is
falling
and
you
need
some
heat
d
i
am
really
fighting
this
bottle
d
from
what
i
understand
this
is
a
lovehate
type
stout
i
most
certainly
dont
hate
this
really
really
delivers
what
it
promises
while
i
couldnt
drink
this
every
single
night
i
wish
id
picked
up
some
more
to
enjoy
midwinter
in
front
of
the
fire
d
wow
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
it
is
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
ever
need
to
drink
it
again
anytime
soon
thanks
michael
and
thats
exactly
what
you
will
smell
intense
balanced
aroma
of
caramel
and
vanilla
the
added
sweetness
by
lactose
is
fantastic
as
lactose
is
an
unfermentable
sugar
so
youre
definitely
drinking
sugar
the
taste
of
caramel
and
vanilla
carries
right
over
and
the
sweetness
hides
the
alcohol
content
you
expect
this
to
be
a
dark
beer
with
mysterious
ingredients
but
i
cant
smell
or
taste
anything
that
isnt
labeled
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
as
hard
as
i
try
to
believe
they
have
a
secret
ingredient
the
carbonation
is
there
but
very
light
almost
creamy
like
a
nitrogenated
beer
so
big
plus
for
that
i
wouldnt
even
say
its
quite
a
mediumbodied
beer
and
doesnt
stick
to
the
inside
of
your
mouth
which
is
a
feel
of
beer
that
i
prefer
in
darker
beers
next
time
i
drink
this
id

it
over

cream
definitely
a
musttry
dont
overendulge
on
this
one
this
is
where
it
gets
sticky
no
pun
intended
ok
maybe
a
little
i
had
no
problem
polishing
off
a
bomber
on
the
other
hand
i
could
easily
go
a
year
or
more
without
the
desire
to
have
another
bottle
and
seeing
as
i
had
to
have
a
good
friend
bring
it
back
from
nyc
that
wont
be
at
all
difficult
d
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
and
i
bemoaned
the
fact
that
i
had
no
more
of
this
after
i
drank
it
all
from
my
cup
an
incredible
beer
and
one
that
ill
definitely
return
back
to
if
i
find
it
again
in
the
store
tastes
pretty
much
like
i
though
it
would
this
is
one
big
flavourful
beer
sweet
roasty
warming
and
one
hell
of
a
dessert
beer
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
but
they
sure
are
good
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
mini
goublet
pours
black
with
no
head
as
it
was
placed
in
front
of
me
you
can
smell
the
sweet
vanilla
aroma
just
like
a
real
cremebrulee
the
taste
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
vanilla
and
reflects
its
name
there
is
a
slight
malt
flavor
and
you
can
taste
the
presence
of
the
high
abv
overall
a
great
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
will
have
it
again
though
drinkability
as
i
said
it
got
a
little
tougher
to
drink
and
the
glass
empties
plus
the
high
alcohol
content
knocks
it
down
for
me
slightly
good
to
have
one
at
a
time
sometimes
overall
this
isnt
the
best
of
the
southern
tier
stouts
ive
had
so
far
but
its
still
very
tasty
and
very
unique
certainly
worth
a
go
on
tap
at
hob
thanks

poured
into
a
6oz
snifter
black
as
night
with
a
white
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
awhile
you
can
smell
this
beer
from
the
other
room
the
most
intese
vanilla
have
ever
seen
in
a
beer
the
flavor
was
the
same
it
tasted
like
vanilla
extract
with
a
little
dry
hops
i
like
the
idea
but
southern
tier
needs
to
consult
ccb
before
trying
this
way
too
intense
switched
over
to
a
loose
cannon
immediately
as
a
suggestion
i
wouldnt
try
this
in
a
glass
bigger
than
a
flight
sipper
without
a
doubt
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
known
smells
of
sweet
cream
vanilla
caramel
and
roasty
coffee
taste
was
just
as
remarkable
as
smell
tastes
of
creme
coffee
caramel
and
vanilla
coated
the
palate
with
a
creamy
goodness
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
all
ingredients
compliment
each
other
in
perfection
drinkability
suffers
just
a
bit
because
of
its
desert
like
nature
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
at
one
sitting
but
damn
i
wish
i
could
unfnbelievable
love
it
i
could
probably
drink
one
of
these
but
would
have
a
tough
time
drinking
the
whole
22oz
in
one
sitting
thanks
dan
for
the
opportunity
to
try
something
new
something
i
would
definitely
not
want
a
whole
bottle
of
for
myself
pours
an
intriguing
dark
brownblack
color
with
the
bare
minimum
of
tan
head
aromas
of
vanilla
roasted
malt
burnt
caramel
and
cream
on
the
palate
this
one
was
sickly
sweet
with
rootbeer
schnapps
imitation
vanilla
extract
and
milk
chocolate
undrinkable
even
in
moderation
i
was
told
this
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
and
i
believe
it
unfortunately
for
me
i
hated
it
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
finally
tried
this
tonight
at
emmasdads
bdaypassing
the
bar
celebration
poured
pretty
dark
nice
with
a
very
sweet
nose
tasted
sweetnesslots
of
sweetness
almost
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
do
more
than
a
few
ounces
i
guess
if
you
like
creme
brulee
this
might
be
to
your
liking
kinda
iffy
for
a
beer
though
glad
i
tried
this
but
seriously
doubt
id
bother
trying
again
d
such
a
rich
beer
and
kind
of
gimmicky
great
on
the
flavors
and
aromas
especially
for
a
dessert
beer
but
much
more
than
a
big
glass
of
this
stiff
would
be
hard
to
put
down
very
enjoyable
though

if
you
have
wives
or

if
there
was

something
that
could

be
called
a

vanilla
after
that
it
goes
down

when
enjoyed
in

large
of
a
quantity
it
starts
feeling
and
tasting
unpleasant
it
is
so
sweet
that
it
starts
cloying
but
im
ok
with
this
beer
if
it
is
supposed
to
invoke
creme
brulee
then
it
should
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
like
its
namesake
generally
it
is
served
in
small
ceramic
dishes
so
ill
stick
with
just
a
small
snifter
full
of
this
beer

sip

a

draft
sample
of
this
last
night
and
honestly
i
cannot
believe
that
this
was
even
beer
it
more
or
less
tasted
like
liquified
cheesecake
or
tiramisu
there
was
a
heavy
cream
taste
with
strong
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
the
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
and
the
taste
really
is
a
lot
more
like
kaluha
than
anything
else
nonetheless
this
sample
was
more
than
enough
for
i
would
not
want
more
it
is
the
a
good

beer
but
if
anyone
can
seriously
take
more
than
this

drinkability
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
i
was
expecting
an
overly
sweet
beer
which
i
got
but
i
did
not
expect
the
awful
burnt
bitterness
that
lingers
i
put
a
wine
stopper
in
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
and
put
it
back
in
the
fridge
ill
probably
dump
it
edit
i
went
back
to
it
an
hour
or
so
later
this
stuff
is
undrinkable
drain
pour
overall
this
beer
seems
like
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
and
i
happen
to
not
like
it
there
are
huge
creme
brulee
flavors
but
i
found
it
unbalanced
and
at
points
undrinkable
not
something
i
will
have
again
but
it
could
be
good
for
some
creme
brulee
lovers
notes
good
beer
but
if
you
do
not
like
vanilla
i
would
think
twice
before
purchasing
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
but
heavy
and
thick
a
little
sticky
or
clingy
despite
its
strength
and
sweetness
the
coffeechocolate
bitterness
keeps
it
from
being
overwhelming
pours
a
thick
brownblack
into
a
10oz
goblet
no
head
but
i
didnt
see
it
poured
so
that
might
have
been
the
bartender
the
smell
is
almost
overpowering
extrenely
sweet
tastes
exactly
how
it
smells
very
thick
very
sweet
i
would
drink
it
as
an
afterdinner
liquer
more
than
anything
else
the
large
format
bottle
it
usually
comes
in
would
probably
be
too
much
for
me
but
wonderful
in
the
right
quantity
and
situation
10
hides
it
very
well
and
is
very
smooth
overall
this
is
the
second
brew
that
i
actually
quite
like
from
this
brewer
all
the
others
i
have
reviewed
before
the
pumking
i
didnt
like
very
much
now
i
look
forward
to
my
mokah
i
have
been
sitting
on
for
about
6
months
this
is
truly
like
black
bottled
crème
brulee
all
the
aromas
are
there
vanilla
caramelized
sugar
the
eggcrème
amazing
flavor
is
also
there
gets
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
12
oz
bottles
may
be
more
appropriate
but
just
find
someone
the
share
it
with
i
think
this
may
be
almost
as
good
as
the
kuhnhenn
crème
brulee
id
love
to
sample
them
sidebyside
i
cant
believe
some
people
gave
this
a
low
review
because
it
tastes
like
it
should
a
sweet
creme
brulee
stout
beer
d
moderate
to
low
almost
almost
too
sweet
to
drink
the
last
pint
is
harder
than
the
first
takes
real
determination
i
enjoyed
it
might
buy
a
bottle
again
but
would
be
fine
if
that
was
a
year
from
now
a
truly
imperial
beer
and
a
real
eyeopener
not
the
tastiest
smoothest
or
best
but
interesting
for
sure
d
too
strange
and
too
sweet
to
ever
get
interesting
its
definitely
one
of
a
kind
ill
give
the
brewery
that
and
the
fact
that
it
tastes
so
much
like
creme
brulee
is
quite
impressive
but
it
still
isnt
a
good
beer
its
basically
just
a
cloyingly
sweet
dessert
disguised
as
a
stout
and
if
i
want
a
dessert
ill
get
a
dessert
not
a
beer
if
you
like
creme
brulee
then
you
must
try
this
beer
if
not
you
will
think
it
is
too
sweet
job
well
done
souther
tier
d
drinkability
is
decent
considering
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
by
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
couldnt
really
detect
any
alcohol
presence
through
the
sweet
backbone
of
the
beer
like
mentioned
above
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
cloying
sweetness
not
the
alcohol
this
is
dessert
this
is
one
of
the
most
inriguing
beers
ever
made
the
candlelight
dances
off
of
her
furrowed
brow
and
our
eyes
lock
together
we
smile
and
i
dream
of
one
day
overall
this
was
a
really
fun
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
must
admit
however
that
while
the
first
glass
was
great
the
full
bomber
was
a
little
much
and
it
got
a
little
tiring
by
the
end
this
is
one
id
have
to
share
and
since
i
dont
have
anyone
to
share
with
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
very
often
another
one
i
wish
was
sold
in
12oz
bottles
id
probably
pick
it
up
regularly
as
a
treat
regardless
this
beer
tastes
exactly
as
its
advertised
and
it
doesnt
beat
around
the
bush
either
bold
flavorful
and
very
interesting
either
you
love
it
or
you
hate
it
i
think
and
i
certainly
found
it
very
enjoyable
absolutely
lives
up
to
its
name
this
is
like
drinking
creme
brulee
also
not
all
that
easy
to
imbibe
due
to
high
abv
and
the
sweetness
that
can
be
cloying
at
times
its
called
creme
brulee
its
sweet
guess
what
it
tastes
like
youll
never
guess
ok
ill
tell
ya
it
tastes
like
creme
brulee
if
you
like
creme
brulee
you
will
likely
dig
this
beer
pay
attention
to
serving
temperature
as
with
most
good
beers
the
flavors
really
come
out
in
the
low
to
mid
forties
a
novelty
beer
for
sure
tread
lightly
my
friends
unless
you
are
a
huge
fan
of
vanilla
flavoring
and
have
your
dentist
on
retainer
d
this
would
be
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
if
the
vanilla
wasnt
so
overpowering
while
not
quite
a
drain
pour
i
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
overall
its
nothing
i
would
hunt
down
but
nothing
i
would
turn
down
either
solid
brew
from
a
solid
brewery
so
this
beer
is
great
in
the
main
sensory
aspects
taste
smell
but
not
really
in
all
the
finesse
things
its
opaque
black
but
there
isnt
much
head
retention
or
lacing
it
smells
like
pure
butterscotch
delicious
it
tastes
like
it
too
like
butterscotch
candy
sandwiching
a
fleeting
bit
of
dark
maltcoffee
taste
this
is
a
beer
hidden
within
candy
good
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
however
and
its
overcarbonated
i
could
still
drink
it
for
most
of
the
night
though
another
robust
offering
from
southern
tier
i
will
buy
this
again
d
very
nice
sweet
this
is
a
beer
that
will
take
some
time
to
get
through
but
would
be
totally
great
in
a
small
snifter
with
a
slice
of
cheesecake
i
give
this
2
thumbs
up
d
drinkablity
was
as
good
as
you
can
get
for
a
drink
that
tastes
like
dessert
if
you
love
dessert
than
youre
going
to
think
this
is
a
great
addition
to
any
meal
or
a
good
substitute
when
a
pint
of
ben
jerrys
just
wont
do
the
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
were
pretty
much
in
line
with
any
good
milk
stout
tastes
extremely
sweet
toasted
chocolate
burnt
sugar
vanilla
been
overdose
and
malty
goodness
malt
is
really
an
aftertaste
with
so
much
sweetness
off
the
front
i
would
describe
this
as
a
starbucksized
beer
everything
has
been
added
to
this
beer
to
sweeten
enhance
and
uplift
a
delicious
beer
that
would
make
a
great
after
dinner
drink
with
company
over
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
rest
of
this
beer
another
hit
in
southern
tiers
blackwater
series
is
it
shockingly
sweet
yes
is
it
decadent
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
yes
i
submit
that
this
beer
well
achieves
the
essence
of
its
namesake
totally
disgusting
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
highly
alcoholic
brew
im
very
impressed
in
how
this
brewery
replicated
such
a
complex
dessert
as
creme
brulee
so
faithfully
bottom
line
if
you
like
creme
brulee
you
will
enjoy
this
offering
if
your
not
a
fan
you
might
find
this
to
be
too
sweet
pours
a
deep
and
opaque
black
although
some
reddish
highlights
are
in
the
corners
very
thick
light
tan
head
forms
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
and
thin
layer
lace
streaks
on
the
glass
looks
good
smell
is
great
very
rich
butterscotch
big
vanilla
caramel
corn
raisin
more
toffee
cream
lactose
sweetness
very
malty
a
hint
of
roast
but
basically
big
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
taste
is
similar
milk
chocolate
hazelnut
vanilla
caramel
and
butterscotch
more
vanilla
more
caramel
just
insanely
rich
like
dessert
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
love
this
beer
never
really
experienced
the
caramelized
and
vanilla
flavours
as
rich
as
this
in
any
other
beer
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
however
it
is
a
lot
to
drink
at
once
i
shared
it
was
some
family
but
it
was
still
very
heavy
after
reading
some
reviews
i
expected
this
to
not
taste
like
creme
brulee
but
it
did
a
definite
must
try
drinkability
one
and
done
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
sure
id
have
another
though
the
beer
is
improving
as
it
warms
up
perhaps
i
started
this
with
it
being
too
cold
though
the
recommendation
is
42
degrees
this
is
scary
drinkable
that
said
it
is
a
bit
sweet
to
session
i
will
however
find
another
bottle
to
enjoy
cheers
d
well
after
a
strong
start
to
our
relationship
thats
two
awful
brews
in
a
row
from
st
chokolate
being
the
other
as
i
said
earlier
this
was
just
a
complete
mess
it
tried
to
a
beer
a
dessert
beer
and
a
stout
at
the
same
time
and
ended
up
accomplishing
neither
im
starting
to
think
i
need
to
stay
away
from
dessert
flavored
beers
they
just
dont
seem
to
work
for
me
try
this
at
your
own
risk
d
a
unique
stout
with
the
addition
of
being
brewed
with
vanilla
beans
very
sweet
but
is
somewhat
balanced
by
the
roasted
malts
share
the
22oz
with
a
friend
almost
too
rich
and
sweet
to
drink
by
yourself
i
was
expecting
something
creamier
but
this
stout
has
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
it
tends
to
get
better
as
it
warms
up
though
worth
a
try
at
least
once
but
st
makes
better
boundarypushing
imperial
beers
choklat
for
example
for
someone
like
me
who
enjoys
beers
that
arent
too
hoppy
this
is
a
great
drink
thanks
to
the
wonderful
smell
and
balanced
taste
with
very
wellhidden
alcohol
content
this
is
something
i
would
most
certainly
drink
again
definitely
have
to
check
out
the
other
southern
tier
offerings
after
this
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
what
you
would
expect
for
something
called
creme
brulee
tons
of
vanilla
and
caramel
taste
is
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
burnt
sugar
very
sweet
this
one
is
tough
to
drink
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
by
myself
it
became
too
much
the
second
time
i
wisely
shared
it
with
a
group
of
people
and
it
was
much
more
enjoyable
with
a
small
glassful
as
a
nightcap
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
stouts
i
have
ever
had
purchased
this
22
oz
bomber
from
big
z
beverage
in
huntington
ny
you
are
either
going
to
love
this
concoction
or
hate
it
i
actually
enjoyed
every
moment
of
this
gem
from
the
first
sip
to
its
last
even
if
imperial
milk
stouts
arent
your
thing
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
at
least
once
you
will
not
be
disappointed
the
10
abv
is
undetectable
so
drink
carefully
wonderful
beer
this
poured
an
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
some
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
crazy
sweet
like
marshmallows
and
vanilla
and
confectioners
sugar
with
some
heavily
creamed
coffee
and
a
bit
of
oak
it
tasted
like
burnt
sugar
and
french
vanilla
and
rich
caramel
with
coffee
and
cream
and
toffee
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
wow
this
beer
is
so
sweet
i
had
read
other
accounts
of
it
and
theyre
not
exaggerating
luckily
i
have
a
pretty
big
sweet
tooth
so
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
i
could
definitely
understand
if
others
cant
stand
it
its
a
polarizing
beer
it
actually
reminded
me
more
of
tiramisu
than
creme
brulee
due
to
the
hints
of
coffee
still
despite
the
sweetness
i
thought
it
was
surprisingly
complex
many
different
types
of
sweet
and
enjoyable
it
hid
the
alcohol
super
well
but
this
beer
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
id
easily
buy
this
again
and
im
curious
how
it
might
age
d
not
particularly
drinkable
to
me
i
dont
particularly
like
it
but
my
wife
definitely
feels
the
opposite
the
appearance
is
typical
for
the
style
with
a
dark
red
brown
color
bordering
on
black
with
an
average
head
for
the
style
the
head
is
foamy
and
fizzy
making
it
not
quite
right
bu
still
nice
the
aroma
is
probably
the
best
i
have
ever
encountered
it
has
the
richest
creme
beulee
i
have
ever
encountered
maybe
even
more
than
the
real
thing
outstanding
the
taste
is
not
as
impressive
but
still
quite
good
it
has
cream
chocolate
coffee
caramel
molasses
toffee
and
bitter
hops
the
bitter
hops
ruin
what
could
possibly
be
one
of
the
best
combination
of
flavors
in
any
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
only
average
bordering
on
thin
and
not
right
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
seriously
hurt
by
the
astringent
hops
but
this
is
a
seriously
good
beer
drinkability
is
also
questionable
while
i
liked
the
flavor
initially
this
gets
harder
to
drink
with
each
sip
or
swallow
would
have
been
better
had
it
not
been
in
a
bomber
bottle
i
was
going
to
share
this
with
someone
she
took
a
few
sips
and
wanted
no
more
notes
i
enjoyed
the
more
simple
choklat
from
the
same
brewery
more
than
this
one
which
tends
to
be
all
over
the
place
this
is
the
8th
and
final
soutern
tier
beer
that
i
have
drank
and
rated
since
visiting
there
last
weekend
through
this
experience
i
can
safely
say
that
southern
tier
is
one
of
our
better
craft
breweries
thee
most
aromatic
and
unique
smelling
brew
ive
ever
encountered
a
little
heavy
on
the
palate
but
with
its
deep
hints
of
sweet
vanilla
chocolate
and
molasses
on
the
nose
you
expected
that
it
poured
almost
dark
black
with
a
small
white
head
that
vanished
rather
quickly
its
taste
of
rich
vanilla
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
but
becomes
bitter
with
some
coffee
and
at
the
end
nicely
finishing
of
the
almost
overly
sweet
tone
purchased
from
the
blatz
beer
cave
in
milwaukee
wi
poured
gently
into
a
snifter
this
beer
was
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
of
caramelized
sugar
and
taffy
it
really
does
smell
just
like
creme
brulee
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
this
beer
had
overthetop
flavors
of
burnt
sugar
vanilla
and
cream
it
taste
a
little
too
much
like
real
creme
brulee
im
not
saying
that
is
necessarily
bad
just
that
22oz
is
a
lot
of
it
to
drink
in
one
sitting
and
i
split
the
bottle
with
my
fiancee
its
definitely
a
sipper
plus
theres
totally
cows
on
the
label
whats
not
to
love
d
i
like
sweet
things
and
am
happy
to
have
tried
this
however
this
is
super
duper
sweet
and
after
about
8
oz
i
had
enough
plus
its
10
abv
after
it
warmed
a
bit
from
staying
in
my
glass
for
well
over
an
hour
the
alcohol
came
out
in
the
taste
more
too
but
still
enjoyable
and
a
definite
treat
southern
tier
seldomly
disappoints
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
as
it
exhibits
flavors
i
have
never
experienced
in
a
beer
before
truely
original
this
beer
is
one
to
seek
out
if
this
beer
had
a
little
more
body
this
would
easily
be
one
of
the
best
imperial
stouts
ever
great
stuff
overall
i
love
vanilla
and
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
very
straightforward
beer
if
you
like
stouts
and
you
like
vanilla
you
will
like
this
beer
hell
even
if
you
like
one
out
of
two
you
will
still
still
like
this
this
is
highly
recommened
for
both
the
beer
drinker
and
and
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
craft
beer
of
imperial
style
beers
meh
poured
rich
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
wow
thats
vanilla
thats
the
aroma
the
taste
is
largely
vanilla
and
sweeeet
there
is
some
hot
melted
caramel
in
there
too
which
just
adds
to
the
sweetness
feel
was
just
a
little
thin
but
there
was
carbonation
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
drinkability
aye
theres
the
rub
i
loved
it
but
22
oz
was
way
too
much
about
10
oz
would
have
been
ideal
scs
creme
brulee
is
the
perfect
dessert
beer
as
the
name
would
imply
have
some
coffee
ready
black
no
sugar
please
o
overall
i
am
really
surprised
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
often
as
it
is
very
sweet
but
i
have
to
give
st
credit
this
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
scores
adjusted
a
little
upward
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
like
a
coffee
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
overwhelming
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
there
is
a
sweet
malt
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
overpowering
it
is
very
bitter
but
not
from
hops
like
the
flavors
didnt
all
match
up
there
is
hints
of
vanilla
as
well
as
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
the
taste
and
smell
can
be
overpowering
d
this
is
a
perfect
dessert
beer
that
i
could
see
a
lot
of
non
beer
drinkers
even
enjoying
i
would
only
be
able
to
drink
a
snifter
of
this
at
best
it
does
have
an
actually
good
drinkability
to
it
but
the
sweetness
cuts
down
on
its
actual
drinkability
will
buy
some
more
bottles
of
this
wow
just
as
it
says
this
is
a
creme
brulee
in
a
glass
its
quite
crazy
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
bottle
you
can
taste
this
and
it
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
since
choklat
by
southern
tier
its
not
a
beer
id
want
to
have
on
a
daily
basis
or
even
just
a
beer
id
want
to
sip
alone
but
for
taking
to
a
party
or
tasting
its
awesome
something
very
different
that
very
few
breweries
could
do
well
dthe
only
drawback
if
you
have
more
than
one
of
these
i
applaud
you
being
as
complex
as
it
is
all
across
the
board
doesnt
make
it
as
drinkable
as
most
beers
the
aromas
and
robust
flavor
catches
up
to
you
after
a
few
sips
not
making
it
bad
by
any
means
but
just
teetering
the
line
of
undrinkablility
after
a
while
incidentally
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
would
use
as
an
example
of
just
because
you
can
make
it
doesnt
mean
you
should
really
a
creme
brulee
beer
in
22oz
form
who
thought
that
was
a
good
idea
christ
dgiven
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
or
2
given
the
style
i
dont
think
this
is
a
session
beer
anyway
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
as
i
thought
this
should
be
a
little
creamy
for
all
these
intense
sweet
flavors
the
sweetness
of
this
detracts
from
this
a
little
but
there
is
no
alcohol
flavors
to
deter
either
all
in
all
a
very
interesting
beer
from
st
this
beer
is
just
as
advertised
creme
brulee
it
smells
and
tastes
just
as
the
dessert
does
it
is
unfair
to
compare
this
to
other
stouts
because
it
is
completely
different
other
than
color
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
again
the
southern
tier
brewery
has
made
a
dangerously
smooth
imperial
style
beer
the
high
alcohol
content
10
is
masked
well
and
this
beer
is
exceptionally
smooth
the
flavors
wake
up
all
taste
buds
at
all
points
of
the
tounge
each
sip
is
its
own
adventure
highly
recommended
cheers
d
an
incredible
drink
and
probably
one
of
the
best
per
style
ive
tasted
with
lancasters
milk
stout
a
close
second
only
the
10
0
abv
and
sweet
dessert
type
nature
prevents
this
from
going
down
any
smoother
then
it
already
could
enjoyment
was
near
perfect
second
to
none
my
only
parting
words
would
be
that
this
beer
seems
a
bit
to
sweet
and
potent
to
be
bottled
in
a
bomber
for
one
serving
this
would
be
best
shared
with
a
friend
consuming
a
whole
bottle
by
ones
self
is
like
eating
dinner
then
having
a
whole
german
chocolate
cake
for
desert
a
bit
overkill
volume
wise
but
there
are
some
of
us
who
cant
deny
that
sweet
chocolately
calling
overall
its
a
really
goodunique
beer
sweet
and
sassy
southern
tier
continues
to
impress
they
make
some
out
there
beers
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
black
with
a
little
tan
head
that
disapated
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
the
smell
was
a
very
pleasing
vanilla
and
carmel
the
taste
followed
suit
with
smell
with
the
vanilla
up
front
it
is
also
very
sweet
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
with
low
carbonation
amd
a
little
oily
feelvery
nice
over
all
a
very
good
beer
would
recomend
it
as
an
apertif
because
of
it
sweetness
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
good
sipping
beer
etc
cool
bottles
with
lots
of
info
my
least
favorite
of
their
imperial
stouts
but
still
pretty
damn
good
a
love
hate
beer
for
sure
edit
this
was
much
more
bearable
ontap
the
sweetness
was
tempered
pours
a
dark
black
color
one
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
toffee
sweet
malt
slight
hops
and
slight
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
double
imperial
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
strong
alcohol
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
coffee
hint
of
hops
and
a
resounding
sweetness
throughout
overall
a
very
strong
brew
that
im
glad
i
did
not
try
before
my
other
two
beers
tonight
wow
incredible
flavor
body
and
drinkability
southern
tier
crème
brûlée
is
a
brownish
black
ale
with
a
dense
rich
beige
head
that
leaves
incredible
lacing
it
has
a
very
strong
vanilla
aroma
that
fills
the
room
wowza
its
quite
sweet
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
it
smells
like
crème
brûlée
its
full
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
a
reasonably
clean
finish
its
quite
sweet
and
vanilla
is
the
dominant
flavor
theres
caramelized
sugar
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
finish
it
tastes
like
crème
brûlée
it
makes
for
an
awesome
dessert
beer
d
ive
said
it
a
few
times
already
but
this
beer
is
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
it
hardly
tastes
like
a
beer
and
was
difficult
to
finish
moderate
mouthfeel
a
bit
syrupy
and
thick
not
overly
drinkable
a
bit
much
d
the
cold
temperature
allows
for
a
better
drinkability
than
when
its
served
at
the
correct
temperature
however
i
will
still
have
to
work
to
get
the
pint
down
definity
a
dessert
beer
and
should
probably
be
served
in
a
ten
ounce
snifter
pours
black
with
a
finger
of
head
that
disappears
quickly
from
my
25
oz
snifter
smell
is
holycowvanillaandtoffee
this
truly
is
a
dessert
beer
no
other
way
to
describe
it
the
taste
follows
closely
whipped
cream
toffee
vanilla
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
carbonation
sting
not
really
that
great
for
a
milk
stout
drinkability
is
where
this
one
fails
and
let
me
tell
you
what
it
really
fails
the
taste
itself
is
excellent
but
after
about
4
oz
i
honestly
didnt
want
any
more
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
bomber
this
one
is
cloying
and
annoying
i
know
what
they
were
aiming
for
and
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
but
that
doesnt
make
it
actually
drinkable
i
found
this
to
be
really
amazing
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
anything
sweet
there
are
so
many
flavors
going
on
here
that
the
sweetness
is
balanced
out
pours
dark
black
and
the
aroma
makes
your
mouth
water
it
smells
like
some
dessert
just
pulled
from
the
oven
there
is
vanilla
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
going
on
while
this
is
utterly
delicious
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
the
whole
pint
because
of
how
rich
this
beer
is
needless
to
say
i
truly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
again
if
i
were
tracy
morgan
i
would
take
this
beer
behind
the
middle
school
and
get
it
pregnant
pours
pitch
black
like
a
brand
new
batch
of
coffee
with
a
one
finger
dark
tan
head
the
head
falls
to
a
thin
layer
on
the
beer
after
a
minute
or
two
and
leaves
medium
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
know
this
is
an
imperial
stout
but
the
goal
of
the
beer
is
a
creme
brulee
stout
and
the
smell
is
caramel
vanilla
sugary
awesomeness
this
one
smells
like
a
delicious
dessert
mmm
taste
here
falls
a
bit
shorter
than
the
smell
the
creme
brulee
factor
decreases
a
bit
and
it
becomes
half
dessert
and
roasted
malts
the
creme
brulee
shines
again
in
the
after
taste
maybe
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
too
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
an
imperial
stout
for
me
it
is
smooth
but
doesnt
really
fillcoat
the
mouth
very
well
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
here
not
too
heavy
on
the
stomach
good
taste
and
smell
will
drink
again
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
little
bit
of
redish
highlights
coming
through
if
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
big
very
light
tan
head
at
first
but
pretty
quickly
it
reduces
to
almost
nothing
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
one
is
mainly
vanilla
thats
all
i
really
got
out
of
it
there
may
have
been
a
hint
of
coffee
but
the
vanilla
really
stood
out
to
me
taste
was
the
same
though
the
coffee
came
through
a
bit
more
really
sweet
tasting
and
honestly
had
a
cream
soda
like
taste
to
it
which
im
not
completely
sure
im
down
with
haha
overall
not
a
bad
taste
just
not
what
i
really
want
to
enjoy
in
a
beer
pretty
good
mouthfeel
however
thick
which
is
what
i
want
in
a
stout
drinkability
is
average
above
average
at
best
at
leas
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
night
or
even
often
i
may
pick
it
up
again
but
most
likely
i
would
pick
up
other
southern
tier
products
instead
id
say
its
worth
a
try
but
its
pretty
sweet
tasting
and
strong
on
the
vanilla
nothing
wrong
with
that
if
you
really
like
that
kind
of
thing
drinkability
is
so
so
i
would
never
be
able
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
i
needed
4
people
to
help
me
finish
this
one
this
brew
pours
a
dark
dark
mahoghany
to
black
color
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
diminishes
quickly
to
a
few
bubbles
little
to
no
lacing
on
this
brew
looks
a
little
thin
for
the
style
the
nose
is
simply
amazing
w
boat
loads
of
cracked
vanilla
bean
that
can
be
realized
without
even
completely
bringing
your
nose
to
the
glass
also
has
the
aroma
of
nuttiness
and
caramel
in
the
background
the
taste
is
the
same
vanilla
bean
in
your
face
w
burnt
caramel
coffee
and
licorice
on
the
finish
could
definately
session
this
one
if
i
had
more
of
an
alcohol
tolerance
as
i
once
did
and
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
11
00
i
feel
the
thinness
for
the
style
helps
in
this
aspect
overall
this
is
the
perfect
dessertafter
dinner
beer
and
a
nice
offering
from
southern
tier
as
i
have
grown
to
expect
from
them
dvery
drinkable
as
a
dessert
beer
so
sweet
that
it
might
turn
some
people
off
but
not
me
poured
into
a
goblet
for
a
blackish
body
and
a
onefinger
light
brown
head
buttery
vanilla
milk
a
little
an
intensly
sweet
smell
that
i
started
to
pick
up
as
soon
the
cap
came
off
a
touch
of
bread
and
burnt
malt
are
also
in
there
pretty
close
to
actually
smelling
like
a
creme
brulee
dessert
smooth
ultra
creamy
with
vanilla
caramel
hints
of
spice
and
wood
in
taste
a
dryness
thanks
to
some
burnt
malts
in
a
medium
body
that
was
a
little
sticky
finishes
dry
and
is
complemented
by
the
abv
a
perfect
dessert
beer
and
i
recommend
having
one
and
only
one
after
a
nice
dinner
i
feel
like
this
might
get
a
lot
of
flack
for
being
so
sweet
rich
or
gimmicky
but
i
have
met
few
beers
that
so
thoroughly
accomplish
their
objective
as
this
one
i
feel
like
this
is
something
southern
tier
nails
the
rich
evocative
dessert
beers
pumking
choklat
included
d
i
enjoyed
it
all
night
drinkability
a
novelty
the
nose
was
exceedingly
inviting
but
i
personally
feel
it
didnt
live
up
to
billing
had
it
remained
smooth
throughout
with
a
mild
finish
it
may
have
been
worth
more
than
a
well
i
tried
it
opinion
even
as
it
warmed
the
vanilla
retained
a
medicinal
twang
perhaps
a
small
amount
paired
with
chocolate
or
vanilla
bean
icecream
would
work
overall
this
beer
is
simply
to
sweet
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
it
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
lot
i
can
see
this
being
good
on
ice
cream
or
chocolate
cake
thanks
jnn4v
conclusion
this
was
a
great
after
dinner
drink
its
huge
in
mocha
flavors
and
butterscotch
and
vanilla
its
a
bit
overthetop
and
too
sweet
to
enjoy
much
at
a
time
but
definitely
interesting
went
perfectly
by
itself
and
with
from
scratch
german
chocolate
cake
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
soutern
tier
big
beers
have
become
sort
of
a
hobby
of
mine
my
favorite
being
pumking
on
a
winter
night
i
could
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
one
i
will
try
it
again
but
not
for
some
time
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
big
puffy
tan
head
super
great
smell
of
caramel
vanilla
actually
has
the
aroma
of
creme
brulee
taste
of
maltsvanilla
and
a
little
alcohol
very
smooth
chewy
feel
coats
the
mouth
with
vanilla
and
malts
a
great
desert
beer
but
not
one
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
a
very
unique
beer
would
only
drink
this
as
an
desert
or
maybe
a
night
cap
very
nice
sweet
taste
but
just
far
to
rich
for
what
i
would
actually
want
in
a
beer
overall
id
use
this
with
a
dessert
recipe
in
a
reduction
or
something
like
that
its
a
pretty
rough
beer
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
like
this
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
interesting
looking
brew
at
the
cbx
it
pours
super
inky
black
held
it
up
to
light
and
zero
translucence
virtually
no
head
whats
there
is
merely
a
ring
of
light
brown
the
aroma
is
straight
up
vanilla
ridiculousness
maybe
some
hints
of
caramel
in
there
and
touches
of
alcohol
reminiscent
of
kahlua
for
some
reason
when
i
first
smelled
this
i
thought
pancakes
with
extra
butter
and
syrup
it
hints
at
creme
brulee
but
not
quite
an
exact
match
after
smelling
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
again
heavy
on
the
vanilla
with
some
light
hints
of
coffee
and
alcohol
its
pretty
sweet
up
front
with
a
relatively
lackluster
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
actually
a
little
thin
in
spots
and
unfortunately
doesnt
lend
to
the
idea
of
wanting
to
drink
more
its
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
an
interesting
idea
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
something
ill
come
back
to
after
trying
the
bottle
about
a
week
ago
i
took
the
notap
variation
to
see
if
i
could
find
much
difference
i
found
mokah
to
be
a
bit
lessenjoyable
on
tap
and
my
creme
brulee
experience
suffered
the
same
fate
whereas
the
bottle
begins
with
a
flavor
and
aroma
which
are
so
robust
and
sweet
that
it
may
excite
and
entice
at
first
then
becomes
a
bit
cloying
and
artificial
ontap
i
immediately
found
these
unpleasant
qualities
there
is
a
chalky
quality
to
the
taste
which
contrasts
the
sweetness
but
doesnt
add
any
enjoyment
to
the
drink
drinkability
suffers
from
these
unpleasantries
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
overall
though
im
willing
to
grant
it
3
5s
instead
of
belowaverage
numbers
because
its
certainly
a
better
option
thana
lot
of
things
and
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
very
strong
or
generally
enjoy
sweetness
it
may
be
quite
enjoyable
like
other
st
stout
offerings
im
finding
the
sort
of
artificial
quality
to
the
flavor
shows
through
more
ontap
its
fun
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
full
pints
worth
d
incredibly
good
if
you
like
creme
brulee
but
so
rich
and
sweet
that
i
couldnt
have
a
pint
on
my
own
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
as
well
and
i
feel
like
you
need
to
have
at
least
three
people
to
split
the
bottle
amongst
although
my
wife
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
d
good
after
dinner
beer
although
would
prefer
in
an
812po
serving
the
bomber
was
hard
to
finish
in
one
sitting
bc
of
the
sweetness
cheers
black
hue
in
body
with
light
coffee
head
topping
aroma
of
creme
brulee
vanilla
cream
coffee
with
cream
caramel
not
as
pleasant
as
i
envisioned
on
the
palate
cola
with
pours
of
vanilla
light
coffee
caramel
syrup
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
the
downfall
of
the
beer
lies
in
the
cola
character
with
dabs
of
vanilla
and
coffee
the
upside
is
the
light
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
the
beer
possesses
a
sweet
treat
but
has
room
for
improvement
d
i
would
be
good
with
a
2
oz
sample
glass
of
this
my
10
oz
glass
just
became
too
sweet
but
it
all
boils
down
to
this
tastes
and
smells
like
the
real
thing
southern
tier
does
not
seem
to
let
you
down
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
decent
dark
brown
pour
with
short
lived
mocha
head
smell
unbelieveably
powerful
kind
of
like
the
smell
of
flavored
coffee
beans
taste
is
amplified
even
more
it
is
good
no
denying
its
just
that
it
is
so
incredibly
intense
this
is
the
sweetest
beer
ever
scaldis
framboise
you
are
excused
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
bit
thin
would
add
to
the
taste
if
it
was
a
smoother
beer
but
it
is
not
drinkability
is
a
tough
call
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
sipper
a
bottle
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
its
criticized
for
containing
more
sugar
than
hops
but
this
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
chugger
instead
this
stout
is
the
brewers
version
of
ice
wine
or
port
i
would
not
drink
another
right
after
because
it
is
just
too
rich
and
powerful
instead
i
would
cap
off
a
dinner
containing
a
rich
cream
sauce
with
just
one
pint
or
even
split
a
22oz
bottle
i
can
definitely
feel
my
craving
increase
this
resembles
drinking
a
chocolate
milkshake
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
man
would
this
be
an
outstanding
dessert
drink
drinkability
well
hm
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
come
through
here
in
any
appreciable
way
outside
of
its
effect
if
it
werent
so
roasted
so
heavily
burnt
so
astringent
it
would
be
much
nicer
but
probably
still
even
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
likely
for
most
im
glad
to
have
actually
reviewed
it
following
my
beatification
creme
brulee
debacle
debacle
but
i
wont
be
enjoying
this
one
again
anytime
soon
likely
d
pretty
good
not
a
bad
beer
doesnt
deserve
the
heat
it
gets
a
very
sweet
dessert
beer
tasty
and
smooth
but
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
i
could
swear
there
is
kaluha
in
this
very
drinkable
and
tasty
i
like
it
a
lot
drinkability
is
difficult
to
rate
on
a
beer
like
this
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
with
in
reason
a
bomber
is
too
much
drink
due
to
the
overpowering
sweetness
would
be
perfectly
suited
as
a
dessert
beer
shared
amongst
friends
pours
a
deep
and
opaque
black
although
some
reddish
highlights
are
in
the
corners
very
thick
light
tan
head
forms
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
and
thin
layer
lace
streaks
on
the
glass
looks
good
smell
is
great
very
rich
butterscotch
big
vanilla
caramel
corn
raisin
more
toffee
cream
lactose
sweetness
very
malty
a
hint
of
roast
but
basically
big
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
taste
is
similar
milk
chocolate
hazelnut
vanilla
caramel
and
butterscotch
more
vanilla
more
caramel
just
insanely
rich
like
dessert
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
love
this
beer
never
really
experienced
the
caramelized
and
vanilla
flavours
as
rich
as
this
in
any
other
beer
not
for
everyone
but
i
really
dig
it
thanks
sid
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
astringent
dessertlike
drinkability
d
drinkability
is
decent
the
10
of
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
and
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
pint
after
said
pint
it
gets
a
bit
harder
to
handle
still
drinkable
but
starts
to
become
cloyingly
sweet
at
the
end
of
a
bomber
glad
i
finally
got
to
crack
one
of
these
open
and
kudos
to
southern
tier
for
another
beer
that
pushes
the
envelope
just
a
little
further
not
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
again
unless
the
recipe
was
tweaked
a
little
suggestions
1
12
ounce
bottles
2
more
foam
3
tone
down
the
aroma
or
make
it
more
complex
its
a
little
too
onesided
4
12
ounce
bottles
this
bottle
could
be
hot
hopefully
we
can
sit
on
a
bottle
for
a
while
and
try
it
again
in
a
year
and
hope
for
improvement
for
such
sweet
thick
beer
i
found
it
to
be
easier
to
drink
than
i
thought
i
went
through
one
bomber
by
myself
and
seriously
thought
about
another
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
i
found
myself
sipping
rather
quickly
and
delighting
in
this
intriguing
dessert
in
a
bottle
nice
job
s
t
d
a
great
slow
beer
having
a
few
sips
too
close
together
can
make
the
sweetness
reach
a
cloying
level
wonderful
to
take
large
gulps
spaced
well
enough
apart
feel
jipped
out
of
9
for
the
220z
bomber
but
that
is
how
it
goes
sometimes
i
can
think
of
two
things
that
i
would
love
to
see
in
this
beer
a
barrel
aged
version
and
a
nitro
mouthfeel
average
as
well
not
as
thick
as
i
like
a
stout
but
not
thin
by
any
means
creamy
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
this
was
unlike
anything
i
have
had
and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
be
able
to
finish
an
entire
bomber
of
this
by
myself
without
getting
sick
it
is
just
too
rich
however
it
is
worth
at
least
one
try
for
those
who
are
curious
and
open
minded
bomber
from
whole
foods
vienna
va
split
with
a
friend
in
fayetteville
this
beer
poured
and
intense
opaque
black
with
a
2
finger
of
thick
creamy
head
head
retention
was
decent
and
left
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
an
overpowering
of
artificial
vanilla
butterscotch
and
caramel
smell
to
it
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
are
slightly
detectable
the
taste
follows
the
same
as
the
nose
at
first
there
is
a
pretty
decent
chocolate
and
dark
malt
flavors
however
those
are
quickly
met
with
a
harsh
butterscotch
and
caramel
the
artificial
vanilla
tasting
hits
you
throughout
and
the
booziness
doesnt
help
i
was
hoping
as
it
warmed
the
tastes
would
become
less
harsh
but
alas
it
didnt
this
is
a
heavy
body
lighter
carbonation
with
a
thick
and
creamy
feel
to
it
i
am
generally
a
big
fan
of
southern
tier
but
this
beer
was
far
off
the
mark
for
me
the
harshness
in
the
taste
made
this
beer
very
very
close
to
a
drain
pour
for
me
it
was
very
difficult
to
finish
this
bottle
overallone
of
these
will
do
a
night
what
a
great
beer
well
crafted
and
i
recommend
you
try
it
d
im
kind
of
torn
on
this
on
the
one
hand
i
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
and
theres
something
to
be
said
for
a
beer
that
sets
out
to
be
this
desserty
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
lot
better
if
it
were
taken
down
a
notch
or
two
if
it
were
around
8
or
9
abv
it
would
be
amazing
drinkability
this
one
is
probably
an
aquired
taste
but
i
love
it
this
is
the
most
vanilla
i
have
had
in
any
beer
i
do
love
how
it
mixes
with
the
burnt
malt
i
cannot
wait
to
have
this
again
but
at
most
would
have
two
because
of
the
high
abv
d
i
like
to
think
of
this
beer
as
more
of
a
novelty
its
nice
to
enjoy
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
liqueur
than
a
beer
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
as
i
do
enjoy
drinking
it
i
just
dont
see
myself
going
through
too
much
though
i
think
if
they
blended
a
little
jahva
with
this
it
would
be
divine
i
bought
a
bottle
of
this
tonight
and
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
the
whole
room
filled
with
a
strong
vanilla
and
butterscotch
aroma
like
a
sweet
punch
in
the
face
poured
this
beer
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
is
a
powerful
combination
of
vanilla
butterscotch
and
light
coffee
the
first
sip
hits
like
a
ton
of
bricks
with
huge
vanillabutterscotch
notes
mixed
with
a
light
hint
of
alcohol
it
really
does
taste
like
creme
brulee
its
a
thick
beer
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
pleasant
with
the
alcohol
sneaking
up
at
the
end
to
finish
off
the
almost
too
sweet
taste
there
is
definitely
no
need
for
dessert
if
youre
drinking
this
beer
it
borders
on
being
too
sweet
but
would
go
great
with
a
slice
of
vanilla
cake
or
custard
pie
overall
i
would
say
its
a
beer
you
should
definitely
put
on
your
list
to
try
since
it
is
so
different
from
most
beers
you
find
out
there
but
be
careful
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
especially
if
you
drink
a
bottle
yourself
not
a
selection
you
could
sit
and
drink
all
night
but
enjoyable
as
an
after
dinner
aperitif
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
aromas
of
vanilla
butterscotch
and
mocha
the
taste
is
a
little
off
from
the
smell
and
carries
more
mocha
and
coffee
the
the
traditional
french
dessert
i
have
had
it
bot
on
nitro
i
think
by
mistake
but
awesome
and
reg
pour
you
never
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
but
more
of
the
same
flavors
as
there
mocha
stout
either
way
great
beer
as
long
as
you
only
have
1
or
2
little
sweet
due
to
the
lactic
sugars
great
for
an
appertif
or
before
dinner
drink
i
had
this
beer
at
the
judges
bench
in
ellicott
city
md
on
a
nitrogen
pour
last
year
it
is
a
thick
black
stout
that
made
the
entire
bar
smell
like
creme
brulee
every
time
one
was
poured
this
beer
is
so
over
the
top
you
can
completely
throw
away
your
preconceived
notions
of
what
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
before
you
try
this
this
is
the
essence
of
a
dessert
beer
you
can
substitue
your
dessert
with
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
tons
of
body
and
flavor
caramel
vanilla
chocolate
dominate
with
little
to
no
hop
character
its
big
and
its
sweet
with
10
alcohol
you
wont
be
having
more
than
one
or
two
even
if
you
have
the
room
in
your
stomach
for
it
overall
i
would
recommend
the
beer
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
truly
extreme
beer
i
dont
like
the
direction
that
my
beer
drinking
has
taken
me
lately
im
looking
forward
to
breaking
into
the
cellar
soon
and
bringing
out
some
grade
a
stout
bombs
so
i
can
find
out
if
its
the
brews
or
if
its
me
very
dark
appearance
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
smelled
like
hazelnut
vanilla
and
butterscotch
candy
tasted
like
a
fine
desert
with
sweet
butterscotch
like
flavors
that
would
fade
away
to
alcohol
as
it
slowly
rolled
over
the
tongue
i
would
beware
of
this
beer
i
see
the
potential
of
becoming
inebriated
without
knowing
it
was
very
tasty
and
could
see
this
beer
paired
well
with
a
desert
like
tiramisu
or
cheesecake
the
beer
is
very
unique
took
me
back
to
buying
sugar
daddies
as
a
kid
d
i
give
this
beer
its
lowest
score
for
drinkability
because
its
so
sweet
and
because
it
will
get
you
loaded
really
fast
if
you
guzzle
it
thinking
its
just
sugar
most
people
will
not
want
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
a
little
bit
paired
with
cheese
or
a
rich
dessert
its
fantastic
and
a
great
way
to
end
a
meal
i
love
st
beers
especially
all
of
the
other
blackwater
series
stouts
but
this
was
way
too
sugerydesserty
if
you
love
to
drink
creme
brulee
cb
youll
love
this
beer
it
tastes
exactly
like
it
sounds
exactly
poured
into
a
dfh
snifter
it
looks
great
and
you
smell
the
cb
immediately
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
know
im
supposed
to
consider
that
in
my
review
so
im
just
going
to
leave
it
at
what
i
said
above
its
like
drinking
candy
luckily
my
wifes
girl
friend
liked
it
so
i
gave
her
the
rest
of
the
bottle
the
drinkability
is
a
tough
cookie
to
crack
i
wouldnt
like
this
beer
as
a
drinking
beer
at
any
point
in
my
life
no
way
would
this
taste
good
to
start
any
session
but
after
dinner
this
really
hit
the
spot
i
loved
the
intense
malt
the
huge
hazzelnut
punch
and
the
massive
sugar
overload
its
just
what
i
was
crazing
after
the
big
dinner
with
friends
usual
jet
black
stout
color
very
slight
tan
head
on
top
amazingly
deep
and
complex
aromahuge
vanilla
notes
and
caramelized
sugar
just
insanely
like
a
dish
of
creme
brulee
flavor
is
simply
fantastic
massive
vanilla
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
rich
creamy
chocolate
heavily
caramelized
taste
ever
so
slight
espresso
richness
really
comes
across
as
a
dessert
great
solid
body
silky
smooth
not
a
hint
of
being
10
just
an
incredible
beer
either
you
love
it
or
hate
iti
love
it
have
to
knock
it
down
a
notch
as
it
is
so
rich
and
dont
see
consuming
a
lot
of
it
i
think
this
is
just
a
great
example
of
what
a
brewer
can
do
mmmmmm
crème
brulee
stouts
probably
my
least
favorite
of
southern
tiers
black
water
series
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
is
best
served
in
very
concentrated
amounts
its
extremely
sweet
and
dessertlike
the
flavors
pretty
good
the
first
few
sips
but
it
grows
very
tiring
very
quickly
i
dont
feel
quite
as
strongly
about
as
some
do
i
definitely
dont
love
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
either
i
definitely
feel
that
its
a
novelty
thats
worth
experiencing
even
if
only
once
hey
if
youre
available
i
still
have
a
little
bit
of
a
bomber
that
id
love
to
share
drinkability
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
have
downgraded
but
i
know
its
because
i
just
dont
really
care
for
creme
brulee
and
the
sweetness
this
beer
imparted
i
know
it
probably
is
a
well
crafted
beer
though
wow
that
was
quite
the
trip
best
shared
i
think
a
good
dessert
beer
after
12
oz
i
am
quite
satiated
and
satisfied
the
sweetness
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
something
id
go
back
for
more
for
the
right
occassion
id
drink
it
again
though
not
sessioning
as
this
is
a
bit
heavy
and
with
a
respectable
abv
drinkability
loved
this
on
draft
but
in
the
bottle
it
becomes
a
bit
tiresome
still
quite
an
accomplishment
to
make
a
beer
taste
like
dessert
pours
complete
darkness
of
night
with
no
moon
in
sight
nice
brown
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
throughout
session
smell
is
in
your
face
vanilla
beans
with
alcohol
lurking
far
behind
tastes
like
sweet
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
extremely
sweet
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
little
carbonation
makes
it
seem
thicker
drinkability
because
its
so
sweet
isnt
the
best
i
downed
a
bomber
but
i
dont
think
id
go
further
than
that
very
tasty
though
a
desert
all
in
itself
overall
impression
strange
beer
im
pretty
much
morally
opposed
to
drainpours
but
in
the
case
of
creme
brulee
this
rule
was
meant
to
be
broken
the
beer
pours
dark
dark
brown
to
black
i
can
already
smell
the
vanilla
pouring
out
not
much
head
or
retention
is
sticking
the
aromas
are
prominent
with
vanilla
and
caramel
this
reminds
me
of
a
vanilla
cream
soda
for
sure
on
the
taste
very
sweet
vanilla
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
full
body
with
a
lasting
finish
the
taste
of
vanilla
lingers
on
my
lips
good
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
my
wife
gave
me
her
half
as
she
found
it
too
sweet
i
finished
the
bottle
over
a
three
hour
period
but
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
when
split
with
a
friend
as
its
a
very
strong
distinct
taste
that
gets
old
after
a
glass
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
first
gets
a
bit
tougher
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
d
decently
drinkable
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
creme
brulee
is
best
served
in
small
amounts
not
tubs
so
this
brew
has
its
limitations
in
drinkability
would
go
well
as
a
dessert
accompaniment
drinkability
amazingly
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
drinking
this
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
this
is
one
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
for
as
long
as
the
resistance
to
gulp
it
down
holds
out
what
i
wouldnt
give
to
be
a
fly
on
the
wall
during
a
southern
tier
brew
session
d
if
you
want
a
sweet
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
then
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
definitely
a
desert
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
an
after
dinner
drink
my
advice
is
to
get
the
half
pint
if
possible
unless
you
want
diabetes
drinkability
awesome
i
could
probably
drink
another
few
of
these
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
to
the
sweetness
which
makes
it
very
enjoyable
its
not
just
an
overly
alcoholic
and
malty
beer
say
like
an
eisbock
theres
a
lot
of
character
in
this
southern
tier
has
done
a
great
job
at
beerafying
a
desert
i
havent
yet
been
disappointed
by
their
blackwater
series
keep
it
up
st
and
thanks
for
the
recent
distribution
to
wa
this
is
a
beer
best
enjoyed
in
small
glasses
with
a
dessert
its
actually
pretty
much
a
dessert
unto
itself
drinkability
moderate
to
high
for
such
a
big
beer
drinkability
while
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
something
to
truly
behold
i
would
have
to
put
this
a
little
lower
because
of
the
high
abv
and
strong
sweetness
to
it
this
is
strictly
an
opinion
though
because
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
my
personal
palate
but
still
youve
gotta
appreciate
this
one
d
i
actually
recapped
this
beer
because
my
wife
and
i
couldnt
handle
it
all
in
one
sitting
we
went
back
to
it
2
days
later
and
it
tasted
the
same
so
the
recapping
saved
it
i
would
need
to
have
like
6
people
over
to
have
a
whole
bottle
pours
out
a
beautiful
black
color
even
with
pretty
vigarous
pour
not
much
head
but
it
is
light
tan
in
color
and
laces
sporadically
smell
is
like
candy
burnt
sugary
sweetness
coffee
caramel
malts
and
i
swear
butterscotch
taste
is
disgusting
way
way
way
too
sweet
sticky
caramel
butterscotch
chocolate
and
coffee
lead
to
an
incredibley
hard
to
drink
beer
i
must
say
i
do
not
really
like
sweet
eats
very
much
but
on
occasion
ill
have
one
this
beer
however
is
ungodly
sweet
very
hard
to
drink
this
lots
of
candy
sweet
malty
flavors
but
i
need
some
bitterness
or
some
sort
of
balance
this
is
just
way
too
far
in
the
sickly
sweet
catagorey
definitely
one
to
share
preferably
with
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
because
this
tastes
nothing
like
one
the
label
says
i
should
drink
this
at
42
degrees
maybe
because
this
is
at
43
degrees
that
it
is
this
bad
but
i
doubt
it
ugh
this
is
gross
if
i
want
dessert
ill
get
one
if
i
want
a
beer
i
wont
be
drinking
this
this
beer
i
opened
it
and
thought
i
was
six
years
old
in
a
candy
shop
literally
the
smell
was
so
great
i
wanted
it
for
my
cologne
very
light
head
that
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
left
a
light
lacing
in
the
snifter
i
used
had
a
very
sweet
taste
that
was
similar
to
its
aroma
but
while
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
wishing
i
had
someone
to
share
it
with
i
guess
the
main
downfall
it
has
is
that
its
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
i
highly
recommend
splitting
a
bomber
with
someone
md
these
are
the
only
categories
where
i
gave
a
slightly
lower
score
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
even
though
it
is
a
great
tasting
beer
i
didnt
find
myself
wanting
to
drink
much
of
it
overwhelming
a
bit
maybe
either
way
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
sweet
flavor
of
the
beer
just
tastes
very
fake
and
processed
it
doesnt
taste
like
creme
brulee
it
tastes
like
a
nonfat
yogurt
or
something
if
you
are
new
to
southern
tier
dont
let
this
one
scare
you
away
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
full
body
and
creamy
the
finish
is
sweet
and
linger
no
lie
this
beer
taste
just
like
the
dessert
except
it
is
heavier
with
caramel
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
definitely
a
sipper
i
just
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
have
read
they
either
love
or
hate
a
love
hate
relationship
i
love
it
because
it
is
an
extreme
beer
and
something
many
are
not
willing
to
try
is
it
drinkable
yes
and
no
the
beer
is
difficult
to
drink
but
easy
to
sip
extremely
difficult
to
finish
half
the
bottle
althouth
i
can
appreciate
what
they
were
going
for
a
little
over
the
top
and
im
pretty
over
the
top
the
black
water
series
from
southern
tier
contains
some
of
the
best
beer
on
planet
earth
unfortunately
creme
brulee
misses
the
mark
although
not
by
much
because
it
pushes
the
envelope
too
far
in
one
direction
some
love
it
some
hate
it
i
can
take
it
or
leave
it
really
creamy
mouthfeel
with
slickness
and
sweetness
just
right
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
lower
than
expected
for
the
flavor
as
its
so
heavy
this
is
a
one
off
sipper
the
wife
didnt
like
it
but
if
im
stuck
on
an
island
a
need
a
dessert
beer
this
would
be
the
one
along
with
new
glarus
belgian
red
d
i
probably
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
finish
the
bottle
myself
fun
enjoyable
beer
but
only
on
rare
occasion
with
people
to
share
and
can
handle
the
omgsweet
very
drinkable
where
the
choklat
is
overpowering
later
in
the
beer
and
kind
of
bitter
the
creme
brulee
is
sweet
thick
and
not
overpowering
at
all
a
perfect
balance
of
all
the
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
they
are
so
good
will
revise
if
i
wake
up
at
night
burping
vanilla
like
i
did
the
choklat
good
but
the
immense
sweetness
detracts
somewhat
from
the
drinkability
need
at
least
two
people
for
this
beer
served
in
a
dogfish
head
22
oz
snifter
glass
slow
pour
yielded
very
little
head
save
a
nice
velvet
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
appearance
was
jet
black
smelled
of
vanilla
beans
birthday
cake
and
obviously
of
creme
brulee
southern
tier
does
a
great
job
with
using
great
aroma
type
hops
in
combination
with
unique
add
ins
which
in
this
case
saw
columbus
hops
paired
with
vanilla
beans
taste
was
candy
sweet
with
a
delicious
vanilla
and
fudge
after
taste
which
seemed
to
linger
on
the
taste
buds
detected
a
nice
hidden
bitterness
undoubtedly
from
the
horizon
hops
used
mouthfeel
was
in
the
medium
range
with
sweet
stouts
i
would
say
that
the
mouthfeel
was
not
quite
as
thick
and
creamy
as
youngs
double
chocolate
but
not
as
thin
as
mackeson
or
lancaster
milk
stout
in
regards
to
drinkability
i
would
not
have
anymore
than
one
of
the
650
ml
bottles
that
southern
tier
puts
this
in
for
several
reasons
first
of
all
not
only
is
this
stuff
10
percent
but
as
with
many
other
southern
tier
stouts
oatmeal
and
choklat
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
beneath
the
sweet
candy
like
flavor
in
short
this
stuff
will
knock
you
on
your
butt
if
you
are
not
careful
secondly
one
would
probably
not
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
because
of
the
intense
sweetness
being
a
stout
drinker
i
generally
have
one
of
these
and
follow
up
with
a
nice
hoppy
stout
or
porter
like
guiness
or
victory
storm
king
overall
the
more
and
more
i
drink
souther
tier
beers
the
more
i
appreciate
their
craftsmanship
and
orginiality
it
is
a
shame
that
this
is
a
seasonal
as
i
just
happened
to
luck
out
and
find
a
bottle
at
a
local
liquor
outfit
the
new
batch
comes
out
in
june
and
i
plan
stockpile
i
may
even
try
and
save
a
choklat
and
mix
the
two
together
a
great
sweet
stout
highly
recommended
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
ok
ok
its
not
as
bad
as
some
people
say
im
probably
not
seeking
it
out
again
but
it
may
work
for
people
unconvinced
about
dessert
beers
the
sweetness
is
cloying
and
must
be
matched
up
with
something
like
a
raspberry
and
champagne
white
cake
with
buttercreme
frosting
which
is
what
i
did
drinkability
after
completing
the
bomber
bottle
i
kind
of
lost
interest
in
having
any
more
this
is
a
one
or
two
glass
beer
at
best
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
head
and
ample
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramleized
sugar
and
caramel
with
roasetd
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
was
amazingly
like
the
actual
dessert
huge
caramelized
sugar
vanilla
roasted
malt
wow
a
party
for
the
taste
buds
but
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
for
some
mouthfeel
was
great
with
much
carbonation
to
coat
all
surfaces
drinkability
is
a
little
limited
first
due
to
the
very
high
abv
but
also
this
can
get
a
little
much
with
the
rich
taste
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
a
bomber
really
needs
two
people
at
least
to
maximize
enjoyment
think
of
this
as
dessert
as
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
creme
brulee
the
desert
item
is
as
much
a
tactile
experience
as
it
is
a
taste
experience
when
you
sit
down
and
think
about
it
creme
brulee
in
drinkable
form
is
an
unappealing
thought
which
is
kind
of
what
im
left
with
when
i
look
at
this
brew
overall
thick
but
not
overbearing
the
ideal
dessert
beer
maybe
this
would
be
too
rich
for
some
but
i
thought
it
was
amazingly
drinkable
for
being
such
a
sweet
treat
i
would
love
to
have
to
this
one
again
had
this
again
1
5
years
later
and
it
made
a
good
sweet
dessert
at
the
end
of
a
tasting
but
just
half
a
glass
is
enough
a
bit
overpoweringly
sweet
for
regular
consumption
but
certainly
a
worthy
dessert
beer
d
i
would
highly
recommend
this
wonderful
beer
my
first
southern
tier
and
i
was
blown
away
however
this
is
more
of
a
novelty
beer
and
thats
how
i
am
rating
it
not
something
i
would
kick
back
and
enjoy
a
game
to
but
a
delicious
beer
for
special
occasions
and
that
is
how
i
like
it
surprisingly
drinkable
sweet
but
not
over
powering
srong
but
not
burning
not
something
for
a
regular
diet
but
an
interesting
treat
i
love
southern
tier
brewing
and
all
the
offerings
ive
had
from
them
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
unless
a
hot
chick
that
loves
sweets
is
looking
for
a
brew
a
desert
beer
or
after
dinner
beer
one
i
really
liked
and
would
recommend
di
have
never
had
a
beer
that
tastes
like
this
it
reminds
me
of
melting
vanilla
ice
cream
into
butterscotch
brandy
and
cream
super
thick
and
sweet
a
on
par
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
definetely
a
good
beer
to
share
with
1
or
2
friends
for
dessert
southern
tier
does
a
good
job
with
this
series
in
bringing
the
flavors
to
the
forefront
but
its
a
bit
much
in
this
brew
notes
had
a
small
amount
at
a
tasting
at
the
charleston
beer
exchange
nice
in
a
small
dole
but
tastes
like
something
that
goes
on
pancakes
more
than
in
pint
glasses
i
like
sweet
beers
but
i
dont
think
i
could
make
it
through
more
than
a
pint
date
consumed
21
august
2008
very
slick
feeling
in
the
mouth
drinkability
in
my
opinion
has
to
be
low
even
though
its
very
tasty
im
going
to
have
a
problem
finishing
this
whole
bomber
overall
worth
the
trade
southern
tier
needs
to
get
to
maine
dmoderate
due
partly
to
its
immenseness
the
strong
at
times
overwhelming
vanilla
to
hijack
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavors
but
in
the
end
still
helped
provide
this
beer
its
unique
character
enjoy
as
a
desert
wine
and
share
the
bomber
drinkability
was
very
sweet
but
is
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
which
is
when
it
was
enjoyed
all
in
all
a
complete
disappointment
i
understand
that
i
do
not
like
butterscotch
whatsoever
if
one
who
reads
this
reveiw
does
it
may
be
a
completely
different
story
for
the
price
please
read
the
reviews
and
do
your
homework
boy
is
this
ever
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
i
happen
to
really
like
it
but
it
is
way
over
the
top
and
very
sweet
very
much
a
dessert
beer
i
could
see
how
people
would
hate
it
it
as
well
it
pours
inky
black
with
a
thin
head
smells
quite
sweet
and
exactly
like
creme
brulee
with
burnt
caramel
and
thick
sweet
milk
with
an
eggy
richness
the
taste
is
similar
with
an
even
more
burnt
aftertaste
and
big
rich
vanilla
and
cream
flavors
very
sweet
but
an
uncanny
replica
of
creme
brulee
in
a
glass
with
a
shot
of
brandy
thick
and
viscous
in
the
mouth
its
a
bit
too
rich
and
thick
to
have
much
of
this
but
quite
a
pleasure
as
a
sipper
d
really
heavy
and
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
a
full
pint
but
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
couple
desert
tastes
d
this
beer
really
just
killed
me
when
it
came
to
the
taste
the
creme
brulee
flavors
were
artificial
and
too
pronounced
i
understand
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
extreme
beer
but
you
cant
just
throw
a
ton
of
sugar
into
a
beer
and
pretend
that
its
extreme
i
think
a
better
route
for
this
brew
would
be
to
use
crystal
malts
or
kettle
caramelization
to
impart
a
light
caramel
flavor
and
then
use
vanilla
beans
sparingly
to
add
the
vanilla
notes
im
not
sure
what
they
did
when
brewing
this
but
i
feel
like
some
artificial
flavor
extracts
were
just
tossed
in
at
the
end
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
to
try
and
im
not
saying
it
tastes
bad
per
se
its
just
not
beer
like
in
my
opinion
d
one
half
of
a
bomber
is
enough
for
me

exactly
what
you
would
wantexpect
from
something
labeled
creme
brulee
and
that
alone
makes
this
a
special
beer
mfd
this
is
a
dessert
stout
went
great
as
a
compliment
to
a
great
dinner
i
would
not
consider
this
a
session
beer
by
any
means
way
to
sweet
this
would
be
hard
to
drink
alone
i
split
this
with
three
other
family
memebers
and
barely
finished
mine
due
to
the
sweetness
and
cloyingness
a
good
dessert
beer
and
somewhat
of
a
novelty
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
in
the
future
beware
of
the
sweetness
and
butterscotch
in
this
one
the
body
is
waaay
too
sweet
overall
this
is
not
beer
this
is
a
dumper
how
can
you
drink
this
overall
after
enjoying
southern
tiers
oatmeal
stout
and
choklat
i
thought
that
this
particular
brewing
company
couldnt
brew
any
other
beers
better
than
that
simply
put
i
was
completely
wrong
in
thinking
so
the
crème
brulee
is
one
of
the
most
delicous
beers
to
ever
touch
this
palate
and
i
hope
it
will
again
someday
soon
a
must
must
must
try
cheers
southern
tier
is
not
shy
about
their
unique
flavors
for
beer
and
the
flavors
never
taste
artificial
which
is
what
make
them
even
more
impressive
amazing
job
on
this
one
i
only
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
a
very
interesting
beer
all
around
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
not
sure
ill
be
seeking
out
more
ignore
all
the
critics
try
this
if
you
can
a
very
unique
beer
and
would
pair
well
with
many
desserts
sweet
and
rich
and
a
great
one
to
share
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
for
kicks
but
nothing
spectacular
way
too
sweet
and
sticky
something
new
to
try
for
the
record
books
perhaps
it
would
benefit
from
aging
d
not
overly
drinkable
but
a
fantastic
nightcapdessert
beer
super
sweet
and
is
for
sure
a
creme
brulee
clone
in
liquid
form
how
did
they
get
all
this
into
a
beer
sinful
almost
black
minimal
head
very
inviting
smell
is
butterscotch
vanilla
and
malt
mmm
taste
follows
the
smell
butterscotch
vanilla
shake
molasses
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
and
fullbodied
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
abv
not
a
brew
you
would
drink
all
night
but
like
a
decadent
dessert
absolutely
excellent
i
like
this
brewery
and
i
respect
that
others
may
like
this
but
to
me
it
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
or
alltime
pours
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
very
thin
cap
just
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
smell
vanilla
extract
caramel
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
very
sweet
like
drinking
liquid
butterscotch
alcohol
warming
on
the
finish
nothing
is
there
to
clean
the
palate
so
it
has
a
cloying
sweet
aftertaste
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
bit
of
a
sticky
consistancy
from
the
sweetness
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
very
sweet
and
cloying
and
with
an
abv
up
at
10
best
shared
with
several
people
then
horded
to
oneself
i
will
finish
this
bottle
and
that
will
satisfy
me
of
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
d
wish
i
had
some
ice
cream
to
go
with
this
something
to
enjoy
after
dinner
but
not
something
to
drink
all
nite
its
very
big
and
impressive
overall
an
incredibly
unique
gem
that
needs
to
be
tried
at
least
once
this
is
a
unique
beer
im
not
sure
if
it
is
a
dessert
or
a
beer
but
here
goes
it
looks
good
for
a
stout
and
smells
and
taste
like
butterscotch
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
silky
smooth
stout
i
rate
it
low
on
the
drinkability
scale
only
because
it
was
too
sweet
for
a
more
than
a
rare
occasion
drink
as
long
as
you
have
taste
buds
youll
enjoy
this
its
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
had
has
to
be
the
best
dessert
beer
out
there
if
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
though
you
are
my
hero
its
a
very
filling
beer
job
well
done
southern
tier
d
couldnt
drink
all
the
time
but
it
is
enjoyable
and
awesome
to
share
with
friends
notes
its
just
gross
and
its
just
bad
pours
pitch
black
with
foamy
coffee
colored
head
aroma
of
vanilla
bean
custard
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
maltiness
tastes
like
a
sweet
desert
very
creamy
custard
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
roasted
caramel
maltiness
and
some
butterscotch
sweet
and
roasty
with
a
dry
bitter
hop
finish
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
very
dark
opaque
brown
that
was
almost
black
there
was
no
significant
head
but
instead
a
little
island
of
mocha
foam
on
the
top
with
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
was
mostly
sweet
sugar
with
just
a
touch
of
burnt
to
well
emulate
the
creme
brulee
smell
no
other
aroma
was
noticeable
that
taste
was
smooth
slightly
over
sweet
more
like
store
bought
frozen
creme
brulee
than
a
freshly
made
one
it
had
a
slight
alcohol
after
taste
felt
solid
in
the
mouth
coated
extremely
well
with
no
carbonation
but
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
tongue
alcohol
was
masked
well
but
hit
quickly
and
it
was
too
sweet
to
do
anything
but
sip
slowly
got
this
thanks
to
my
guy
at
binnys
reccomending
it
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
out
of
a
22
oz
bomber
the
aroma
was
like
creme
brule
sweet
and
cinnamony
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
and
was
very
smooth
i
had
to
leave
the
drinkability
down
because
i
couldnt
finish
the
beer
it
was
just
too
sweet
to
knock
out
in
one
sitting
black
but
not
the
darkest
in
stout
appearances
not
too
much
head
smells
like
what
its
titled
thought
it
would
be
too
sweet
from
the
smell
but
the
malt
and
hops
definetly
bittered
the
vanilla
bean
aroma
first
pour
from
the
bomber
was
a
little
sweet
but
the
second
pour
which
had
come
closer
to
room
temperature
was
almost
perfect
in
balance
i
usually
like
my
stouts
to
gain
most
of
their
flavor
from
the
hops
and
yeast
but
southern
tier
makes
some
great
flavored
stouts
i
would
definetly
recommend
this
as
a
dessert
beer
after
a
late
night
dinner
this
beer
had
the
usual
appearance
of
a
stout
nice
tanlight
brown
head
the
first
smell
caught
me
off
guard
with
a
big
wiff
of
dessert
like
sweetness
the
taste
backed
up
the
smell
wholely
dessert
batman
this
is
the
ultimate
after
dinner
beer
mouthfeel
was
very
heavy
close
to
syrup
like
but
great
for
a
dessert
type
sipping
beer
the
drinkability
was
good
but
with
the
alcohol
level
and
heavyness
it
brought
down
the
drinkability
overall
awesome
once
a
year
beer
drinkability
all
kinds
of
fantastic
very
yummy
very
luscious
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
but
beware
as
this
is
a
true
love
it
or
hate
it
brew
hopefully
youll
be
in
the
love
it
camp
drinks
pretty
good
i
could
pound
a
few
with
dessert
a
cheese
tray
or
even
a
red
curry
will
ding
it
a
bit
because
it
would
grown
old
after
about
2
pints
as
a
stand
alone
session
beer
the
abv
is
artfully
hidden
i
could
review
this
beer
all
day
but
i
gotta
get
back
to
planes
trains
and
automobiles
lets
have
some
fucking
beer
already
poured
this
in
to
a
snifter
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
pours
a
very
deep
black
with
a
delicate
pale
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smelling
this
is
all
vanilla
and
caramel
these
are
so
strong
that
i
really
dont
get
anything
else
but
that
is
not
bad
taste
is
a
very
sweet
rich
creamy
caramel
and
vanilla
i
was
expecting
the
sweetness
but
this
is
far
beyond
what
i
anticipated
this
would
par
well
with
pecan
pie
or
enjoyed
for
desert
drinkablity
wise
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
the
sweetness
of
it
made
the
one
glass
i
had
plenty
medium
bodied
lacking
a
bit
of
smoothness
for
something
so
sweet
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
but
quite
close
some
warming
alcohol
is
not
enough
to
balance
you
need
56
people
to
go
through
one
bottle
nice
but
way
too
sweet
body
is
medium
maybe
even
a
tad
on
the
light
side
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
it
should
it
be
heavy
like
an
imperial
stout
or
should
it
be
thin
like
a
milk
stout
nice
in
any
event
drinkable
due
to
its
nice
flavors
and
wonderful
aroma
but
the
alcohol
is
something
to
watch
out
for
i
like
this
stuff
but
the
booziness
is
a
little
much
for
me
the
sweetness
is
very
nice
but
it
may
affect
the
drinkability
overall
a
very
intersting
beer
that
had
a
lot
to
present
and
offer
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
a
bit
too
much
to
have
as
a
regular
drink
but
would
be
a
perfect
after
dinner
sipping
beer
to
converse
over
drinkability
my
wife
had
a
sip
and
said
that
was
nice
but
enough
for
her
given
shes
not
a
dark
beer
fan
i
am
tending
to
agree
i
will
finish
the
22oz
bottle
alone
tonight
since
she
doesnt
want
any
more
but
i
would
see
this
going
over
better
in
smaller
doses
very
much
a
desert
beer
would
be
good
with
some
dark
chocolate
confection
its
a
short
sips
beer
for
me
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
sip
but
not
to
drink
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
often
or
too
much
just
about
a
shot
full
or
a
little
more
is
more
than
plenty
should
be
reserved
for
more
special
occasions
than
monday
night
football
prehaps
thanksgiving
would
have
been
more
appropriate
i
am
satisfied
after
a
small
glass
its
like
a
reward
after
working
hard
perhaps
ill
have
to
find
numerous
neighbors
the
bottle
with
since
it
is
absolutely
way
too
big
for
one
person
d
this
is
strange
to
drink
it
is
sort
of
an
outlander
in
terms
of
style
i
think
the
burnt
malt
taste
is
right
on
with
the
style
but
i
reviewed
this
with
the
knowledge
that
for
the
2
and
3
criteria
this
beer
is
going
to
stray
off
the
beaten
path
of
this
style
of
the
beer
over
all
it
isnt
too
bad
but
not
blow
your
mind
it
is
tasty
though
something
to
sip
on
and
drink
on
occasion
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
brown
head
over
the
barely
translucent
dark
brown
brew
head
recedes
slowly
with
lacing
that
falls
even
slower
aroma
is
vanilla
reminds
me
of
cake
batter
for
some
reason
but
regardless
i
like
it
as
lame
as
it
may
be
the
taste
follows
the
nose
almost
exactly
for
me
with
sweet
dark
maltiness
coming
out
a
bit
more
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
velvet
and
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
the
fact
that
it
might
get
a
bit
cloying
eventually
great
stuff
i
like
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
around
much
i
dont
think
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
big
round
body
this
beer
is
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
stout
its
sweet
but
it
has
balance
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
and
perhaps
this
is
better
considered
a
dessert
anyhow
treated
as
a
beer
it
is
likely
to
be
too
rich
and
too
sweet
for
many
but
to
anyone
who
like
me
have
the
weakness
of
possessing
a
sweettooth
an
uncompromising
appetite
for
dessert
and
just
so
happen
to
also
have
an
appreciation
for
masterful
craftsmanship
brewing
this
is
a
heavenly
thing
drinkability
i
love
the
sweet
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
of
these
for
halloween
it
would
be
the
ultimate
beer
candy
on
the
candiest
night
of
the
year
major
kudos
to
the
good
folks
at
hyde
park
ws
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
bottle
of
this
earlier
in
the
year
an
ideal
night
to
enjoy
it
as
we
have
snow
flurries
in
the
forecast
for
the
first
time
this
season
the
world
series
has
its
first
ever
suspended
game
and
i
mourn
the
loss
of
a
treasured
beer
sweat
beer
glass
it
was
a
freebie
but
a
member
of
the
family
nonetheless
cheers
to
good
beer
good
baseball
and
the
remaining
barful
of
glassware
brotherhood
left
to
carry
on
the
samplingreviewing
tradition
prosit
what
makes
this
a
real
delight
is
the
richness
and
natural
sweetness
of
a
superb
dessertlike
offering
with
the
characteristics
of
a
well
brewed
stout
if
there
is
a
downside
it
emanates
from
those
same
qualities
like
a
toorich
dessert
theres
the
temptation
to
over
indulge
and
that
might
not
be
a
great
idea
if
anyone
is
looking
for
a
fantastic
beer
to
conclude
an
evening
of
fine
dining
particularly
in
mixed
company
i
doubt
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
heartily
recommended
d
the
heavy
alcohol
and
amazing
level
of
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
for
me
a
small
bottle
would
have
been
just
enough
a
bomber
was
difficult
to
get
down
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
its
quite
an
experience
and
the
smell
is
amazing
i
get
the
feeling
its
a
very
polarizing
drink
some
hate
and
some
love
take
all
the
aromoa
scents
and
directly
translate
it
into
the
taste
and
throw
a
little
alcohol
taste
in
there
as
well
it
is
a
good
balance
not
too
heavy
vanilla
up
front
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
followed
by
an
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
flavors
blend
together
more
as
you
drink
more
of
it
nicely
done
not
one
id
go
back
to
often
but
worth
the
experience
served
in
a
tulip
poured
just
one
shade
shy
of
black
zero
light
penetration
half
inch
bubblyfoamy
khakicolored
cap
dissipated
into
a
soapy
skim
some
watery

but
no
legs
nose
is
hands
down
the
best
part
of
this
beer
creme
brulee
in
a
bottle
butterscotch
vanilla
and
booze
taste
follows
nose
with
a
slightly
bitter
hops
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
viscous
and
lightly
effervescent
in
the
background
drinkability
is
somewhat
compromised
brew
is
cloyingly
sweet
and
had
to
be
split
four
ways
an
incredibly
rich
and
decadent
brew
but
certainly
not
for
every
day
consumption
drinkability
might
improve
with
age
if
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
dissipates
over
time
has
great
beer
float
potential
as
usual
southern
tier
does
what
they
intend
to
do
why
they
intended
to
do
this
is
beyond
me
though
i
have
to
try
all
the
southern
tiers
so
i
gave
this
a
try
and
it
was
like
drinking
creme
brulee
poured
dark
with
a
bit
of
a
light
head
smelled
as
advertised
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
tasted
the
same
though
in
my
opinion
too
sweet
a
bit
thin
as
well
but
drinkable
perhaps
worth
a
try
but
not
a
second
may
age
well
so
i
cant
say
i
wont
pick
up
a
second
bottle
to
stow
away
for
christmas
09
black
colored
beer
with
a
poorly
colored
a
bit
too
light
tan
head
nose
is
a
bit
off
balance
with
caramel
and
vanilla
bean
hints
chocolate
and
milk
flavor
is
interesting
and
unique
with
flavors
completely
dominated
by
nonmalt
ingredients
lactose
vanilla
beans
with
other
light
notes
of
chocolate
and
mocha
kind
of
like
it
dont
want
to
pour
it
out
like
choklat
pretty
tasty
just
a
bit
too
sweet
as
well
interesting
beer
for
the
first
time
aroma
like
a
vanilla
cup
cake
laced
with
rum
quaff
is
a
very
sweet
vanilla
rum
ball
with
a
chocolate
coating
including
bits
of
coconut
a
real
desert
beer
to
be
sure
just
a
hint
of
10
booze
in
the
finish
as
a
warm
anise
afterdrink
actually
this
would
be
hard
to
quaff
for
the
long
haul
over
a
couple
hours
but
a
nice
bomber
on
a
cool
fall
evening
d
subtract
points
here
this
beer
is
just
too
heavy
and
sweet
to
be
a
big
drinker
its
dessert
and
its
a
sipper
but
the
sweetness
just
weighs
you
down
and
thus
slows
you
down
the
friend
i
split
it
with
was
right
i
think
a
bomber
would
be
perfect
for
4
people
as
an
afterthanksgivingdinner
drink
im
really
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
on
one
hand
it
is
awfully
sweet
definitely
beyond
my
threshhold
on
the
other
it
is
called
creme
brulee
which
i
hear
is
pretty
sweet
so
you
cant
really
ding
it
for
that
does
it
have
any
glaring
flaws
other
than
sacrificing
drinkability
for
novelty
not
really
check
it
out
if
its
your
bag
hoorah
if
it
isnt
no
big
loss
i
can
say
that
its
not
nearly
as
good
at
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
blackwater
series
i
could
easily
drink
a
bomber
of
this
in
three
swallows
maybe
even
two
its
that
good
dark
dark
ruby
body
very
nearly
black
not
much
light
gets
through
this
one
big
thick
khaki
colored
head
staying
power
is
tremendous
and
the
lace
is
quite
full
strong
thick
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
burnt
cream
its
a
one
of
a
kind
aroma
that
can
be
smelt
from
across
the
room
just
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
big
and
bold
huge
caramel
and
nougat
tones
burnt
cream
and
burnt
coffee
milk
sugars
and
char
contrast
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
some
vanilla
and
chocoalte
as
well
this
is
just
a
one
of
a
kind
flavor
i
dont
know
how
this
brewery
pulls
this
off
with
beers
like
this
and
pumking
to
make
them
so
unique
this
might
be
a
little
too
rich
and
too
heavy
for
some
but
not
for
me
for
a
10
stout
the
drinkability
is
ridiculous
d
i
had
this
beer
by
itself
and
i
loved
it
but
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
an
after
dinner
dessert
wow
southern
tier
makes
good
beer
i
envy
all
you
east
coasters
for
having
easy
access
to
this
stuff
in
the
top
5
of
new
beers
ive
had
this
year
for
sure
this
is
a
sipper
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
i
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
d
it
is
what
it
is
a
sweet
fun
desert
drink
i
was
impressed
by
its
ability
to
be
so
sweet
but
have
enough
dryness
keep
it
from
being
sickly
sweet
not
the
most
complex
but
could
see
having
again
d
quite
drinkable
d
horrible
drinkability
i
cannot
imagine
taking
down
too
much
of
this
in
a
sitting
a
couple
of
sips
were
good
for
me
and
thats
about
all
i
could
do
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
d
this
would
land
a
perfect
10
if
tasting
like
the
food
it
describes
on
the
label
were
a
category
the
flavor
was
huge
and
intense
but
a
bit
to
much
for
a
full
bomber
of
beer
i
think
i
will
try
this
again
but
with
an
espresso
stout
chaser
d
another
big
doubledigit
abv
beer
from
southern
tier
that
blends
envelopepushing
innovation
with
superior
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
stouts
ive
come
across
in
my
beer
travels
good
stuff
here
great
dessert
brew
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
as
scary
as
i
feared
it
wasnt
the
best
thing
in
the
world
but
it
worked
well
enough
something
to
bust
out
every
once
in
a
while
ill
try
cellaring
my
other
bottle
for
a
year
and
see
what
happened
as
im
really
not
sure
what
to
expect
it
probably
will
barely
budge
pours
a
chocolate
cola
colour
with
minimal
head
nose
blast
of
thick
vanilla
taste
creamy
vanilla
super
sweet
with
some
roasted
malts
some
caustic
nuttiness
and
finishes
with
stale
vanilla
thick
too
sweet
booze
is
hidden
i
will
give
it
that
otherwise
uggh
nice
color
amber
brown
not
your
typical
dark
stout
color
awesome
aroma
with
caramel
vanilla
brown
sugar
maple
but
unfortunately
this
brew
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
they
couldve
cut
the
sweetness
in
half
and
still
have
a
lot
of
flavor
if
you
pour
a
small
puddle
in
a
brandy
snifter
an
share
with
friends
youll
be
ok
dont
pour
a
pint
and
expect
to
drink
like
a
beer
a
beer
to
try
great
as
a
dessert
all
on
its
own
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
this
is
a
good
choice
an
above
average
choice
but
not
for
everyone
overall
its
very
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
to
indulge
split
it
with
a
few
friends
after
a
nice
meal
and
you
can
savor
it
bottle
poured
a
deep
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
medium
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
totally
dominated
by
vanilla
and
some
weird
crème
brulélike
syrup
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
vanilla
and
whatever
syrup
theyve
used
and
little
else
is
discernable
full
body
but
could
have
been
creamier
with
good
carbonation
and
no
discernable
alcohol
interesting
experiment
but
a
bit
over
the
top
and
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
a
full
bottle
by
myself
pours
a
thick
cola
brown
to
light
black
no
head
or
foam
what
so
ever
where
d
i
begin
with
the
aroma
you
can
dar
vanilla
ad
caramel
from
five
feet
away
as
you
bring
your
nose
closeryou
get
burnt
cream
milk
chocolate
with
a
warm
baileys
note
at
the
end
sometimes
remids
me
of
christmas
theres
almost
too
much
going
on
in
the
nose
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
no
different
syrupy
caramel
and
vanilla
swirl
together
meeting
at
a
toasted
cream
fork
in
the
road
add
a
splash
of
hersheys
chocolate
dash
of
bailes
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
and
youve
got
creme
brulee
insanely
sweet
and
syrupy
beer
this
is
made
for
desert
only
its
desert
in
and
of
itself
if
you
tried
to
have
this
beer
with
desert
the
beer
would
drown
out
the
flavors
of
ay
desert
i
hink
this
22oz
bomber
will
take
me
at
least
an
hour
to
sip
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
necessarily
the
mouthfell
is
light
but
milky
overall
pretty
good
im
glad
i
tried
this
i
cant
say
its
entirely
my
cup
of
tea
being
to
sweet
but
a
cool
beer
to
try
pours
a
thick
black

this

brew
from
other

way

d
a

disappointed
by
this
and
certainly
something
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
yet
very

overly
sweet
for
me
would
work

get
it
in

trade
i
hate
my
life
drinkability
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
and
in
small
doses
its
not
bad
i
give
southern
tier
credit
for
brewing
outside
of
the
box
however
this
is
just
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
a
22
oz
bottle
customers
should
have
the
option
to
purchase
this
in
12
oz
or
smaller
bottles
unfortunately
im
going
to
have
to
pour
out
more
than
half
of
my
bomber
because
this
just
isnt
very
drinkable
in
large
doses
overall
this
was
all
that
i
thought
it
would
be
huge
butterscotch
aroma
with
a
sweet
vanilla
flavor
that
goes
down
obscenely
easily
definitely
worth
a
try

its

original

slightly
modified
on

d
this
beer
is
sweet
share
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
from
everyones
comments
but
it
does
get
overwhelming
after
a
bit
it
is
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
when
you
have
company
a
few
ounces
with
some
cake
or
something
would
be
perfect
the
smell
is
the
real
show
stopper
here
just
shows
you
what
brewers
are
capable
of
when
they
get
an
idea
great
effort
at
an
extreme
brew
nice
looking
pour
creamy
and
thick
tan
head
smells
very
sweet
over
the
top
sweet
tastes
like
sweet
caramel
more
like
something
my
grandmother
used
to
make
than
creme
brulee
but
i
think
its
pretty
amazing
they
were
able
to
get
that
flavor
into
a
bottle
very
smooth
mouthfeel
some
lingering
licksmacking
sweetness
but
nothing
undesirable
enjoyable
to
drink
but
youre
not
going
to
want
to
sit
and
drink
too
much
at
one
time
nice
beer
to
share
with
someone
especially
if
theyre
not
normally
beer
drinkers
d
its
weirdly
enchanting
in
short
doses
but
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
opposite
of
a
session
beer
then
this
might
be
a
good
candidate
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
d
good
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
bitter
it
gets
they
took
the
brulee
part
a
bit
too
seriously
the
burnt
flavor
is
too
overwhelming
to
drink
more
than
half
a
glass
of
this
22oz
bottle
courtesy
of
tayner
thanks
a
bunch
this
was
dark
black
and
had
a
very
strong
vanilla
and
butterscotch
the
taste
had
very
little
stout
characteristics
almost
pure
butterscotch
i
dont
know
if
that
was
intentional
or
not
but
it
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
choklat
is
a
much
better
offering
in
my
opinion
this
beer
was
an
utter
disaster
in
my
opinion
it
could
have
been
something
nice
if
they
would
have
cranked
down
the
vanilla
extract
cake
batter
taste
about
78th
its
that
outta
wack
it
looks
like
a
stout
without
the
bishops
collar
smell
is
again
vanilla
extract
only
the
taste
is
equally
noncomplex
with
thankfully
some
bitter
roastedness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
irrelevant
as
it
is
too
cloying
to
swirl
in
the
mouth
and
have
more
than
a
few
sips
before
leaving
at
the
bar
again
other
than
appearance
this
beer
was
an
utter
disaster
drinkability
this
is
an
amazing
beer
share
it
d
while
a
really
fun
cool
beer
it
would
get
pretty
unappealing
after
a
night
of
it
dthis
beer
has
a
potent
smell
very
thick
mouthfeel
and
an
off
the
wall
taste
all
of
which
are
decent
but
let
me
explain
my
drinkability
score
well
i
bought
this
beer
before
i
tried
it
on
tap
and
trying
it
on
tap
made
me
wait
a
lot
longer
to
open
it
up
its
not
bad
its
just
way
too
much
esp
a
22oz
bottle
its
hard
to
finish
a
pint
of
this
let
alone
the
whole
22oz
its
my
dads
bday
and
i
let
him
pick
something
from
my
stoutporter
collection
and
this
is
what
he
chose
he
loved
it
its
one
of
his
favorites
not
my
favorite
st
brew
i
would
much
rather
have
uber
sun
and
i
found
creme
brulee
out
this
summer
not
uber
sun
thin
mouthfeel
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
if
you
look
at
my
scores
youll
see
how
schizophrenic
i
found
this
drinking
experience
d
too
big
to
be
taken
on
alone
and
too
sweet
to
truly
enjoy
a
10
or
12oz
pour
this
beer
certainly
tastes
amazing
and
there
are
probably
few
around
like
it
still
does
not
change
the
fact
that
this
beer
may
be
too
big
for
its
own
good
high
rating
as
this
is
what
it
is
creme
brulee
in
a
bottle
sweet
tons
of
rich
carmel
sugar
and
vanilla
take
hold
of
the
palate
and
lingers
for
hours
mission
accomplished
score
reflects
the
essence
of
what
they
were
trying
to
do
22oz
bomber
can
easily
serve
10
people
and
everyone
will
want
to
pour
it
over
ice
cream
this
is
for
sure
an
after
dinner
brew
drinkability
i
didnt
think
this
beer
would
taste
like
creme
brulee
at
all
i
thought
it
would
just
be
a
dark
roasted
beer
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
added
to
it
boy
was
i
wrong
about
that
since
this
was
such
a
sweet
dessert
beer
it
should
really
only
be
drank
once
in
a
great
while
if
it
isnt
then
you
must
have
quite
the
sweet
tooth
this
is
a
very
creative
original
idea
for
a
beer
i
would
like
to
thank
southern
tier
for
having
the
balls
for
brewing
and
distributing
a
beer
like
this
to
the
public
thanks
to
seanpachfddfa
or
however
you
spell
his
crazy
screen
name
for
the
sample
wow
what
an
incredible
beer
of
course
i
got
robbed
for
it
7
for
10
oz
glass
at
the
diamond
in
brooklyn
i
could
have
just
bought
a
bottle
but
in
the
end
i
guess
it
was
worth
it
oh
and
the
bartender
refused
to
give
me
a
sample
first
she
said
that
would
cost
2
but
i
digress
the
10
ounce
glass
was
probably
just
the
right
serving
as
it
is
sweet
and
any
more
would
have
been
just
a
touch
too
much
its
really
a
dessert
beer
although
i
enjoyed
it
right
at
the
bar
none
the
less
massive
amounts
of
vanilla
caramel
and
sweetish
cocoaaccented
malts
are
found
in
the
nose
it
actually
kind
of
smells
like
cake
and
that
carries
over
into
the
flavor
vanilla
caramel
cocoa
sugar
butter
chocolate
and
just
an
edge
of
roastiness
underneath
its
sweet
but
it
somehow
manages
to
keep
from
becoming
cloying
and
thats
at
least
due
in
part
to
the
roasted
malts
remarkably
smooth
creamy
utterly
pun
intended
remarkable
that
said
this
is
a
very
special
beer
and
would
be
perfect
for
special
occassions
valentines
day
christmas
and
it
makes
an
undeniable
eyeopener
for
women
who
dont
like
beer
oh
and
i
wonder
how
this
would
be
alongside
lindemanns
framboise
or
even
mixed
together
i
am
definitely
going
to
buy
more
of
this
hard
to
finish
this
is
a
sipper
if
youre
liking
it
big
if
an
unusual
albeit
failed
attempt
at
an
imperial
stout
imo
a
novelty
that
should
be
filed
listed
as
one
definitely
a
one
timer
no
matter
what
you
pair
it
with
ice
cream
chocolate
vanilla
pudding
maybe
even
creme
brulee
someone
said
you
can
put
lipstick
on
a
pig
its
still
a
pig
this
aint
beer
to
me
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
silky
the
sweetness
would
make
this
an
occasional
treat
for
me
well
worth
trying
would
be
a
good
desert
beer
to
split
southern
tier
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
milk
stouts
are
my
favorite
beers
but
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
im
glad
i
bought
it
but
will
give
the
other
bomber
away
to
a
beerbuddy
and
wont
buy
it
again
if
you
try
it
id
suggest
pairing
it
with
vanilla
or
coffee
ice
cream
to
subdue
the
flavor
a
bit
unless
you
are
looking
for
an
extremely
sweet
beer
that
tastes
like
butterscotch
candy
with
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
i
would
avoid
this
stuff
not
even
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
i
really
tried
but
just
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
one
of
the
few
drain
pours
ive
had
im
gonna
have
to
drink
another
beer
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
pretty
black
eh
offwhite
tan
head
doesnt
last
freaky
aroma
of
flavored
coffee
creamer
cheese
cake
vanilla
pudding
etc
etc
tantalizing
one
moment
artificial
the
next
the
flavor
is
similar
but
a
little
vanilla
pipe
tobacco
as
well
full
body
with
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
perhaps
from
hops
or
roasted
malts
pretty
sweet
too
i
can
see
people
going
apeshit
over
this
and
i
could
even
get
excited
if
it
was
the
finishing
touch
to
thanksgiving
dinner
this
stuff
comes
out
at
the
wrong
time
of
year
provided
i
only
had
an
eight
ounce
glass
but
this
is
a
bit
much
kinda
in
that
category
with
their
pumking
amazing
briefly
but
totally
unsustainable
having
said
that
i
still
commend
southern
tier
for
trying
something
different
it
was
certainly
different
incredible
how
they
did
this
a
creme
brulee
beer
for
sure
an
awesome
dessert
beer
they
replicated
a
creme
brulee
while
keeping
balance
to
the
sweetness
alcohol
covered
reasonably
well
a
nice
smooth
sipper
dwhile
the
smell
is
more
like
butterscotch
the
actual
taste
is
fairly
reminscent
of
the
namesake
dessert
the
charred
malt
really
works
well
as
it
mimics
the
fire
glazed
sugar
and
the
lactose
creates
a
creamy
richness
this
is
not
a
beer
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
but
it
is
tasty
and
they
really
got
what
they
were
going
for
here
share
a
bomber
or
get
this
one
on
tap
because
the
full
22oz
would
get
cloying
fast
i
reccomend
this
beer
highly
pass
on
dessert
and
order
a
creme
brulee
stout
excellent
job
by
southern
tier
wow
southern
tier
has
raised
the
bar
i
thought
choklat
was
the
be
all
end
of
all
but
this
this
is
heaven
in
a
bottle
simply
amazing
big
thanks
to
stevemcqueenjr
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
unique
beer
this
beer
pours
black
in
color
and
has
a
short
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
overwhelming
and
can
be
smelled
across
the
room
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
is
about
the
same
as
the
taste
overall
this
was
certainly
worth
a
try
for
something
different
glad
i
split
this
one
with
a
friend
notes
its
thick
sticky
body
and
its
unchecked
unbalanced
sweetness
made
for
a
very
slow
sipping
beverage
its
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
cheers
to
southern
tier
for
pushing
the
boundary
with
a
very
interesting
beer
dear
christ
this
was
a
sweet
beer
smell
was
like
butterscotch
and
kraft
caramel
squares
just
like
choklat
this
was
very
very
artificial
smelling
reminded
me
of
worthers
butterscotch
candies
as
well
nobody
in
their
right
mind
could
drink
more
than
a
few
ounces
of
this
melted
candy
disguised
as
a
beer
very
milk
and
vanilla
like
with
some
light
hops
that
quiver
at
the
onslaught
of
malt
warriors
overtaking
their
feeble
vines
they
fight
valiantly
but
the
maltacians
rape
and
pillage
their
weak
cones
leaving
them
tattered
vulnerable
and
succeptible
to
disease
the
hops
are
crying
and
the
malts
continue
to
shower
them
with
more
sugar
bombs
oblivious
to
their
screams
noooo
i
literally
saw
a
hop
cone
beheaded
by
a
caramel
square
that
jumped
out
of
this
beer
with
a
maltsword
very
artificial
and
gimmicky
and
tastes
more
like
melted
caramel
and
vanilla
extract
that
creme
brulee
cloying
in
the
smell
alone
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
here
ahhhh
stop
raping
my
mouth
but
i
sort
of
liked
it
in
an
i
was
abused
by
my
parents
as
a
child
and
now
like
really
creepy
men
to
touch
me
in
innapropriate
places
sort
of
way
like
i
said
this
is
totally
like
some
spiked
iced
coffee
drink
if
there
ever
was
one
personally
i
think
this
stuff
rocked
as
i
could
drink
those
starbucks
frappacchino
things
all
day
until
wired
with
caffine
so
goes
with
this
only
id
be
wasted
but
as
a
beer
this
was
slightly
or
i
should
say
very
slightly
missing
a
partial
dark
fruity
tang
or
addition
to
it
that
i
think
wouldve
totally
made
this
even
more
unwholey
wowable
the
10
is
concievable
but
hardly
makes
any
real
break
through
as
is
though
wow
me
likey
and
will
want
more
d
tasty
and
flavorful
goes
down
dangerously
easily
slightly
filling
deceptively
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
since
this
beer
is
so
heavy
its
a
good
sipper
to
sit
down
and
relax
with
and
also
works
well
as
a
desert
beer
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
am
a
bit
torn
about
this
one
its
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
no
doubt
about
that
but
i
think
its
a
bit
too
much
of
a
sweet
novelty
for
my
tastes
i
can
see
why
this
is
liked
though
low
carbonation
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
i
would
have
to
give
this
a
lower
score
on
the
drink
factor
just
because
it
is
so
sweet
and
is
probably
a
beer
you
want
to
share
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
had
this
beer
and
it
was
better
the
second
time
i
will
save
the
third
bottle
for
the
holiday
season
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
but
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
very
sweet
and
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
shared
the
bomber
with
another
friend
and
we
had
a
tough
time
finishing
it
ill
give
credit
to
southern
tier
for
brewing
this
d
nice
after
dinner
beer
for
dessert
but
not
a
session
beer
too
sweet
for
that
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
they
call
it
a
creme
brule
and
imho
it
is
a
close
as
your
going
to
get
without
the
custard
unusually
creamy
for
a
beer
understandable
given
its
roots
in
a
confectory
i
could
not
however
drink
more
than
one
am
glad
i
could
split
this
bottle
this
creation
gets
points
for
originality
if
nothing
else
doesnt
taste
like
anything
ive
tried
before
id
pick
up
a
bomber
of
this
to
share
with
friends
but
some
may
be
turned
off
by
the
sweetness
it
tastes
sort
of
spot
on
as
a
creme
brulee
but
i
think
i
might
have
liked
the
aroma
better
than
the
taste
here
d
i
struggled
with
the
overall
sweetness
of
this
one
smells
wonderful
tm
mouth
is
mediumheavy
carbonation
is
maybe
a
touch
high
flavor
of
lots
of
vanilla
with
some
caramel
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
brings
on
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
vanilla
a
bit
overpowing
and
cuts
down
the
drinkability
to
me
beer
is
a
touch
hot
as
well
which
doent
help
either
bottle
art
love
it
there
arent
enough
beers
that
feature
cows
on
the
label
grey
label
on
black
bottle
is
eye
catching
southern
tier
has
several
great
bottles
oelergud
di
could
drink
this
all
night
for
1
million
dollars
not
a
fan
wont
try
again
glad
to
try
the
novelty
and
thought
it
would
be
good
paired
with
food
but
not
standing
alone
very
sweet
fairly
hot
brew
very
warming
and
delicious
definitely
a
desert
beer
cheers
i
bought
my
bottle
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
unique
and
excellent
brew
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
d
very
drinkable
though
tends
to
ruin
the
palate
to
other
beers
good
night
cap
change
of
pace
beer
creme
brulee
was
so
extreme
that
it
more
closely
resembled
a
beermilkshake
hybrid
than
simply
a
beer
the
folks
at
southern
tier
are
not
at
all
subtle
about
the
use
of
adjuncts
in
their
products
in
this
case
that
means
vanilla
and
lactose
sugar
they
consistently
deliver
exactly
what
the
label
states
and
they
do
it
quite
well
a
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
brew
though
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
the
dessert
that
is
its
namesake
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
something
i
really
want
to
drink
more
than
a
few
sips
of
the
taste
expounds
upon
the
aroma
with
sweet
rich
intense
creme
brulee
flavors
caramel
and
butter
rum
mix
with
milk
chocolate
dark
chocolate
sweet
cream
and
roasted
coffee
sweetness
peaks
near
the
finish
where
it
is
almost
cloying
luckily
some
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
cut
in
a
little
bit
still
a
very
intense
sweet
sipper
fullbodied
with
a
thick
creamy
feel
going
to
be
tough
to
finish
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
southern
tier
keeps
pushing
the
envelope
and
delivering
tastes
dry
chocolate
with
scorch
sugar
and
burned
caramel
butterscotch
and
vanilla
not
so
much
cream
in
the
flavor
as
needed
if
it
were
to
taste
like
the
dessert
aftertaste
is
pretty
accurate
drying
scorch
with
memories
of
the
dessert
hanging
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
creamy
lushious
mouthfeel
until
the
finish
in
which
everything
dries
too
much
needs
to
coat
and
hang
on
the
tongue
imo
leaves
the
mouth
vacant
with
woodylike
grit
on
the
tongue
gives
a
perception
that
the
earlier
flavors
were
empty
burned
flavor
gets
overbearing
as
i
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
making
the
beer
not
so
drinkable
thankfully
im
sharing
this
with
two
friends
overall
a
gigantic
beer
and
a
nice
surprise
from
oftdisappointing
southern
tier
worth
picking
one
up
d
im
really
enjoying
this
but
the
flavor
is
somewhat
one
dimensional
with
butterscotch
im
not
sure
if
this
should
have
more
of
a
stoutlike
quality
to
it
with
more
roastiness
or
if
this
sweet
butterscotch
is
the
way
to
go
i
really
think
as
it
is
aiming
to
be
a
oneofakind
sorta
thing
its
better
off
this
way
so
in
the
end
i
think
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
but
for
drinkabilities
score
i
loved
this
one
glass
and
it
went
fast
but
i
didnt
even
want
to
touch
the
rest
of
the
bottle
pours
dark
dark
brown
that
settles
black
in
the
glass
with
a
dense
tan
onefinger
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
has
an
intense
butterscotch
smell
with
a
little
vanilla
caramel
and
milk
as
well
its
crazy
sweet
smelling
like
a
dessert
the
taste
continues
the
sweetness
and
is
pretty
onedimensional
in
that
respect
there
is
the
milk
and
malt
background
but
its
really
about
the
huge
caramel
butterscotch
and
vanilla
tastes
which
overpower
all
else
the
mouthfeel
is
very
sticky
chewy
even
with
the
sweetness
just
sticking
to
the
mouth
this
is
an
ok
stout
but
id
put
it
near
the
bottom
of
the
southern
tier
impy
series
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
making
drinkability
very
low
damn
near
impossible
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
definitely
dessert
in
a
bottle
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
but
it
doesnt
work
for
me
too
sweet
candy
like
the
beer
is
as
advertised
though
so
no
complaints
drinkability
is
low
it
was
all
the
three
of
us
combined
could
do
to
drink
one
bomber
i
cant
see
myself
ever
having
the
desire
to
crack
open
another
one
either
but
maybe
it
is
just
not
my
thing
drinkability
marked
down
because
it
is
imo
too
sweet
and
at
10
how
many
can
one
have
drinkability
this
is
a
sipping
beer
a
dessert
beer
that
being
said
i
was
quite
happy
to
enjoy
two
after
dinner
it
is
worth
noting
that
after
it
started
to
warm
up
the
vanilla
disapated
and
some
nice
roasted
flavors
came
in
prosit
mk
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
the
flavors
were
nice
but
the
vanilla
aspect
nearly
overpowered
everything
else
if
that
were
toned
down
a
little
and
the
malt
allowed
to
come
through
a
little
more
then
i
imagine
this
would
be
much
more
drinkable
and
overall
better
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
its
definitely
worth
a
try
just
know
that
subtlety
is
not
this
beers
strong
suit
i
wonder
what
some
aging
would
do
to
it
would
be
interested
to
try
this
beer
with
12
years
of
aging
but
i
wont
go
near
it
again
in
the
interim
in
the
context
of
beer
the
rating
for
this
would
be
questionable
in
the
context
of
dessert
this
is
amazingly
good
crack
open
the
bottle
and
butterscotch
aromas
are
already
leaping
at
your
nose
it
pours
deep
brown
black
with
almost
no
head
delicious
flavors
of
butterscotch
caramel
and
burnt
vanilla
lingering
boozy
warmth
sitting
at
the
bar
id
say
maybe
maybe
not
after
a
meal
why
not
have
a
dessert
with
10
alcohol
d
this
is
certainly
an
outstanding
beer
it
seems
st
achieved
exactly
what
they
set
out
to
do
that
being
said
i
feel
like
this
should
be
packaged
in
12oz
bottles
22oz
is
way
too
much
sweetness
for
me
to
handle
creme
brulee
stout
is
a
bottle
to
share
for
sure
a
sipper
for
sure
and
a
desert
beer
at
that
if
this
were
just
a
little
bit
sweeter
id
be
all
over
this
beer
drinkability
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
probably
not
even
a
22oz
bottle
i
need
some
more
d
this
was
very
good
but
the
odd
and
intense
flavors
made
it
hard
to
think
about
having
more
than
one
another
solid
offering
from
southern
tier
well
done
again
southern
tier
another
seasonal
another
rousing
success
perhaps
ill
have
one
left
from
my
stash
for
next
anniversary
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
as
a
side
note
i
have
had
this
from
bottle
many
times
already
from
table
vine
northampton
it
is
a
tad
bit
sweeter
in
bottle
than
on
draft
but
not
overpowering
poured
it
on
some
vanilla
ice
cream
amazing
md
full
bodied
and
incredibly
rich
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
stout
but
the
finish
of
the
beer
leaves
a
somewhat
unpleasant
taste
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
at
least
once
just
not
a
great
beer
a
very
slow
sipper
to
cap
the
evening
d
retardedly
drinkable
for
the
first
few
ounces
then
its
hard
to
get
it
down
d
nice
somewhat
sweet
so
it
is
not
one
you
would
pound
but
i
would
take
it
over
the
real
thing
as
a
dessert
any
day
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
finally
got
a
chance
to
crack
it
open
poured
an
inky
jet
black
with
not
much
head
at
all
very
thick
and
viscous
like
motor
oil
smells
of
loads
of
caramel
vanilla
sugar
lactose
basically
like
dessert
taste
is
overly
sweet
tons
of
caramel
vanilla
cream
lactose
sugar
flan
its
not
that
its
bad
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
enjoyable
its
just
that
it
is
way
over
the
top
sweet
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
oily
not
too
much
carbonation
very
slick
coats
the
mouth
this
is
the
first
beer
that
southern
tier
have
tripped
up
on
in
my
opinion
i
couldnt
get
through
a
pint
of
it
far
too
sweet
i
do
wish
that
i
had
some
vanilla
ice
cream
though
to
pour
this
over
that
would
probably
be
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
22oz
bomber
served
in
a
wine
glass
deep
brownblack
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
fair
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
huge
aroma
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
toffee
full
bodied
with
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
more
vanilla
toffee
and
a
little
coffee
in
the
flavor
alcohol
is
apparent
plenty
of
lacto
sweetness
not
much
bitterness
to
balance
a
good
dessert
beer
i
enjoy
sweet
stouts
so
i
really
liked
this
holy
shit
this
beer
has
some
body
pours
a
nice
thick
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
nice
light
tan
head
quite
vigorous
pour
nose
is
some
cream
slight
coffee
sugar
taste
is
sugar
sugar
sugar
jesus
god
this
is
most
defenitely
a
desert
beer
super
vanilla
cream
and
slight
coffee
flavors
mad
sugar
mouthfeel
is
awesome
outrageously
viscous
and
milky
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
abv
but
is
defenitely
hampered
by
the
ridiculousness
sweetness
if
you
are
looking
for
a
dessert
beer
this
is
most
defenitely
one
for
you
jesus
god
is
this
beer
sweet
quite
delicious
but
dont
expect
to
drink
more
than
one
as
this
bitch
is
filling
as
hell
doing
so
would
induce
a
diabetic
coma
impressed
again
with
southern
tiers
beer
with
extras
a
fantastically
unique
concoction
super
interesting
brew
git
some
di
wish
i
could
make
a
trip
to
souther
tier
and
try
this
on
tap
if
it
is
available
will
be
getting
more
and
sharing
with
friends
d
splitting
a
bomber
is
the
way
to
go
very
much
a
dessert
brew
but
ill
have
again
southern
tier
does
fantastic
work
with
these
over
the
top
coffee
stouts
i
have
previously
drank
jahva
and
found
it
to
be
outstanding
well
done
it
poured
a
nice
very
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
i
served
it
chilled
and
warmed
up
nicely
by
the
end
at
first
the
smell
hits
with
vanilla
minimal
to
no
hop
aroma
the
first
taste
was
vanilla
but
more
of
a
butterscotch
there
was
a
slight
alcohol
sting
at
the
front
of
the
sip
this
confused
me
as
the
bottle
said
10
abv
as
the
beer
warmed
the
butterscotch
taste
became
more
pronounced
and
almost
artificial
in
taste
it
was
nearly
unbearable
i
like
big
offbeat
beers
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
i
would
love
to
see
what
southern
tier
could
do
if
they
toned
down
or
eliminated
the
vanilla
from
this
stout
it
seems
they
brewed
an
ale
for
people
that
dont
like
too
much
beer
taste
in
their
beer
and
nearly
succeeded
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
d
alcohol
is
insanely
well
hidden
this
isnt
by
any
means
a
session
beer
but
its
tremendous
this
can
be
a
touch
cloying
so
splitting
a
bottle
isnt
a
bad
idea
awful
f
get
this
thing
away
from
me
d
this
does
pretty
closely
approximate
creme
brulee
there
is
something
mildly
off
here
that
i
couldnt
get
past
im
glad
i
opened
this
with
several
people
because
i
had
trouble
finishing
one
wine
glass
nice
effort
i
just
didnt
like
it
i
wanted
too
too
alcoholy
and
vanilla
for
me
southern
tier
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
regional
brewing
companies
for
now
ill
stick
to
their
ipa
and
phin
and
matts
and
hope
their
next
big
beer
is
more
to
my
liking
d
well
its
definitely
a
dessert
beer
and
absolutely
delicious
i
shared
it
with
two
nonbeer
lovers
and
it
was
a
huge
hit
well
worth
a
try
but
it
is
a
little
sweet
i
cant
id
the
issue
i
have
with
the
taste
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
mostly
because
of
the
sweetness
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
no
head
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
i
poured
it
properly
and
i
attained
0
head
other
than
the
head
the
beer
looks
very
tasty
the
smell
is
very
powerful
it
smells
like
a
vanilla
cake
with
vanilla
frosting
on
it
with
a
mild
hinto
of
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
very
original
and
well
balanced
you
can
certainly
taste
the
vanilla
in
it
and
it
is
not
overpowering
and
you
can
taste
the
beautiful
toasted
malts
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
comfortable
it
is
nicely
carbonated
it
has
a
high
drinkablility
but
i
doubt
i
could
do
more
than
2
bombers
in
a
night
well
done
beer
st
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
two
finger
tan
colored
head
seems
to
last
forever
before
falling
to
a
thin
creamy
layer
leaving
a
thick
wall
of
lacing
on
the
sides
smell
is
pretty
extreme
a
bit
much
actually
vanilla
extract
werthers
original
candy
with
a
touch
of
smoke
coffee
and
butter
blah
with
lots
of
sugar
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
begins
pretty
boozy
from
start
to
finish
with
similarities
to
amaretto
and
baileys
lots
of
lactose
and
carmelized
sugars
midway
with
super
sweet
white
chocolate
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
with
more
vanilla
and
sugars
i
really
dont
want
to
know
the
calories
in
an
entire
bottle
of
this
beer
may
be
quite
scary
a
big
full
bodied
stout
thats
silky
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
surprisingly
medium
carbonation
which
i
could
use
less
of
this
beer
is
just
insane
plain
and
simple
no
way
can
i
finish
this
bomber
tonight
id
rather
not
gain
a
few
pounds
southern
tier
makes
pretty
outrageous
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
a
beer
to
be
shared
hopefully
future
bas
read
these
reviews
and
understand
that
down
the
road
choklat
is
still
the
black
water
series
champion
in
my
eyes
im
not
sure
this
would
age
well
even
with
the
high
abv
i
just
cant
see
such
a
milky
beer
improving
with
time
definitely
imperial
very
good
but
i
could
not
drink
more
than
two
lets
say
i
almost
said
just
one
but
darnit
this
beer
is
good
probably
one
of
the
thickest
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
was
practically
chewing
each
sip
the
vanilla
flavor
is
a
little
strong
making
the
beer
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
lowing
the
drinkability
its
like
a
giant
liquid
dessert
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
though
one
worth
trying
recommended
drinkability
very
good
unique
beer
it
may
be
a
bit
too
big
to
want
more
than
one
or
even
to
finish
a
bomber
but
it
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
great
beer
that
was
very
well
executed
in
the
brewing
process
beer
should
be
able
to
stand
alone
uhhgggg
just
too
much
drinkability
i
tasted
this
before
and
ran
to
track
84
ri
to
get
it
on
tap
very
good
i
hear
it
is
strong
to
drink
on
your
own
it
should
be
used
as
a
after
desert
drink
md
little
carbonation
and
a
full
body
make
for
a
viscous
brew
drinkability
is
very
limited
due
to
the
sweetness
number
one
but
the
abv
at
10
doesnt
help
overall
good
for
an
after
dinner
drink
but
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
a
very
interesting
brew
skal
very
interesting
idea
for
a
beer
definitely
a
dessert
beer
and
one
that
should
be
shared
cheers
overall
not
bad
at
all
not
the
best
thing
but
for
what
the
style
is
this
was
actually
pretty
damn
good
it
looked
and
smelled
fantastic
it
was
just
the
overall
volume
of
this
bottle
was
a
bit
much
for
me
something
akin
to
a
kre
would
be
much
better
for
this
as
it
is
needs
to
be
sampled
in
limited
amounts
a
must
try
though
for
the
novelty
of
it
pours
a
very
dark
brownoily
black
with
1
pinky
of
thin
burnt
orange
head
very
little
retention
but
some
good
lacing
smells
just
like
creme
brulee
with
notes
of
butterscotch
caramel
vanilla
and
cream
as
well
as
some
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
from
the
start
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
followed
by
vanilla
lightly
roasted
malt
chocolate
lactose
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
medium
full
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
sweet
with
some
roastiness
and
enough
alcohol
to
remind
you
it
is
in
fact
imperial
an
excellent
dessert
beer
and
another
winner
from
southern
tier
great
i
would
revisit
this
one
every
year
it
does
not
drink
like
a
10
beer
to
me
at
all
it
goes
down
easier
than
a
lot
of
regular
stouts
im
sure
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
me
because
i
downed
this
fast
yeah
its
really
sweet
but
i
dont
mind
i
know
some
couldnt
handle
more
than
a
snifter
of
this
but
i
really
didnt
have
trouble
with
a
bomber
whatsoever
well
the
last
46
ounces
were
a
little
work
i
was
tempted
to
pour
some
over
a
bowl
of
ice
cream
but
didnt
want
diabetes
i
hope
im
not
annihilated
by
the
sugar
low
later
on
nonetheless
this
brewery
continues
to
do
great
work
notes
got
this
one
from
dyan
thanks
dogg
this
is
fun
stuff
but
i
recommend
sharing
a
couple
ounces
is
plenty
on
a
side
note
this
would
make
one
seriously
decadent
beer
float
with
a
scoop
of
vanilla
icecream
i
would
imagine
many
will
love
this
and
many
will
hate
it
if
you
dont
want
sweetness
youll
likely
abhor
it
i
on
the
other
hand
while
an
inveterate
hophead
am
a
soul
with
a
dagnasty
sweettooth
and
this
will
capably
cater
to
the
most
intense
sugar
jones
i
shared
the
bottle
and
still
found
it
hard
to
finish
my
share
but
thats
because
of
the
huge
body
and
enamelrotting
sugar
content
as
opposed
to
any
real
faults
simply
in
the
right
context
this
is
nicely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
im
envisioning
actually
trying
it
with
its
namesake
dessert
so
no
matter
love
it
or
hate
it
i
can
think
of
no
reason
someone
would
not
at
least
want
to
try
it
i
did
and
am
quite
happy
ive
recovered
from
the
resulting
diabetic
coma
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
brown
head
into
a
chalice
the
smell
was
of
butterscotch
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
was
a
big
hit
of
butterscotch
and
vanilla
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
slightly
bitter
finish
not
a
bad
approximation
of
a
creme
brulle
in
a
glass
the
alcohol
content
is
masked
quite
nicely
as
well
making
this
a
deceptively
potent
beer
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
opaque
brown
with
just
a
slight
kiss
of
a
beige
head
which
quickly
dissipates
into
a
rim
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
this
beer
is
huge
i
could
smell
it
living
room
when
i
was
in
my
kitchen
i
think
that
this
beer
has
the
strongest
aroma
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
drunk
to
this
point
the
aroma
is
really
just
like
crème
brulee
vanilla
is
overwhelming
subtle
hints
of
toffee
custard
and
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
vanilla
custard
sweet
lacto
coffee
and
a
hint
of
caramelized
sugars
comes
through
on
the
tail
of
the
beer
i
found
it
really
interesting
that
they
got
the
caramelized
sugar
aspect
of
crème
brulee
to
come
across
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
honestly
astringent
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
on
the
palette
this
is
a
good
beer
but
one
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
fire
when
desert
is
in
order
it
really
needs
the
right
circumstances
to
be
outstanding
dnot
something
i
would
even
want
to
drink
all
the
time
although
i
would
love
to
have
it
around
because
when
the
mood
struck
i
dont
think
anything
could
replace
the
want
for
this
one
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
would
enjoy
a
glass
with
a
nice
chocolatey
dessert
hv
d
a
little
on
the
fence
a
small
serving
would
likely
go
over
just
fine
but
likely
nothing
much
over
a
10
oz
snifter
of
it
at
most
it
starts
off
great
scent
is
appealing
in
a
candy
craving
sort
of
way
i
suppose
the
flavour
starts
off
quite
nice
and
body
is
good
as
the
end
of
the
glass
nears
it
becomes
more
cloying
the
flavours
overwhelm
the
palate
a
bit
and
the
novelty
starts
to
fade
well
worth
the
try
and
perhaps
a
good
candidate
to
share
with
company
who
like
such
things
but
not
one
i
can
easily
finish
22
oz
of
d
i
am
by
no
means
a
traditionalist
when
it
comes
to
beer
i
like
fruit
beers
and
brews
that
disregard
the
reinheitsgebot
this
one
however
has
grown
tiresome
after
just
a
few
sips
worth
a
try
but
for
me
not
worth
splurging
on
again
this
beer
is
an
absolute
clone
of
creme
brule
whenyou
smell
it
the
nose
is
creme
creme
creme
the
taste
to
too
strong
for
the
brule
which
takes
away
from
the
nose
of
the
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
and
vanilla
is
not
a
good
match
for
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
creme
brule
tastethe
then
the
high
alcohol
content
hits
you
like
a
lead
balloon
i
am
stillmixed
on
this
one
i
am
a
fan
of
southern
tier
brews
i
want
to
like
it
joe
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
12
brown
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
kick
ass
caramel
and
vanilla
scent
it
smells
like
a
fine
after
dinner
snack
what
a
treat
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
strong
black
and
chocolate
malt
base
along
with
lactose
for
sweetness
and
a
very
nice
vanilla
bean
finish
this
beer
is
outstanding
a
real
easy
drinker
its
sweet
but
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
name
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
southern
tier
has
become
a
premiere
brewering
powerhouse
everything
they
brew
is
top
notch
a
road
trip
is
in
the
works
d
while
you
cannot
taste
the
alochol
it
is
masked
rather
well
it
does
have
a
high
abv
it
is
extremely
sweet
a
decent
dessert
beer
i
could
see
drinking
about
4
oz
of
this
as
a
dessert
the
22
oz
i
tried
to
drink
proved
to
be
far
too
much
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
combination
of
sweet
vanillatoffee
flavor
coupled
with
the
noticeable
alcohol
make
this
one
beer
im
unlikely
to
order
again
any
time
again
soon
this
beer
is
the
holy
grail
of
all
specialty
beers
if
you
find
one
buy
it
on
spot
what
does
it
smell
like
creme
brulee
what
does
it
taste
like
creme
brulee
i
cant
believe
that
a
beer
like
this
was
made
and
made
so
unbelievably
well
at
10
alcohol
it
still
has
no
alcohol
taste
only
sweet
vanilla
you
could
open
a
creme
brulee
and
it
will
make
your
house
smell
like
you
have
a
vanilla
air
freshener
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
hands
down
great
job
to
southern
tier
for
the
effort
they
put
into
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
mellow
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
quite
rich
overall
and
im
glad
im
splitting
the
bomber
with
the
girlfriend
even
though
i
could
see
drinking
it
all
myself
another
bold
crazy
flavorful
beer
from
southern
tier
ranks
up
there
with
kuhnhenns
example
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
small
tan
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
but
that
is
probably
due
to
the
vanilla
the
aroma
is
very
strong
vanilla
is
everywhere
with
cream
graham
cracker
and
hints
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
as
big
as
the
aroma
the
vanilla
is
a
little
tamer
but
still
prominent
there
is
more
graham
cracker
and
milk
chocolate
there
is
also
the
addition
of
a
lingering
roasted
malt
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
one
very
fine
beer
i
can
easily
see
myself
enjoying
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
pretty
drinkable
but
probably
no
more
than
1
or
2
because
of
its
viscocity
and
how
rich
tasting
it
is
very
good
dessert
beer
and
i
really
like
how
southern
tier
delivers
on
bold
flavors
like
this
one
definately
worth
a
try
d
incredible
sweetness
is
balanced
by
dry
roasty
malt
bitter
hops
and
a
touch
of
tingly
alcohol
have
this
one
at
the
very
end
of
your
session
just
like
dessert
served
from
a
22oz
bomber
in
a
delirium
tremens
glass
the
vanilla
aroma
hits
my
nose
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
it
becomes
even
more
evident
as
i
pour
the
color
is
midnight
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
taste
is
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
strong
sweet
vanilla
with
a
little
burnt
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
strong
vanilla
aftertaste
if
i
was
a
big
vanilla
fan
id
give
this
beer
5s
across
the
board
but
its
a
flavor
i
can
only
take
in
small
portions
fantastic
offering
though
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
the
head
goes
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
smells
like
butterscotch
and
vanilla
similar
to
what
a
creme
brulee
would
smell
like
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
but
with
the
addition
of
some
roastedburnt
malt
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
tastes
starts
off
sweet
but
theres
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
that
being
said
its
still
a
mostly
sweet
brew
by
far
mouthfeelbody
is
full
its
very
creamy
rich
and
smooth
alcohol
isnt
very
noticable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
at
a
time
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
dessert
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
tmd
this
is
one
interesting
beer
its
heavy
and
sweet
and
malty
and
even
has
a
bit
of
a
burnt
aftertaste
much
like
real
creme
brulee
the
stout
flavor
and
the
vanilla
and
caramel
are
very
apparent
too
this
would
make
a
nice
surrogate
for
dessert
but
it
is
much
too
heavy
to
drink
much
of
recommended
bottom
line
this
is
an
extreme
beer
for
sure
and
though
i
cant
say
its
drinkability
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
it
is
a
treat
to
drink
i
cant
do
anything
but
place
this
one
firmly
in
the
highly
recommended
category
i
knew
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
sweet
sticky
incredibly
vanilla
laden
beer
coming
into
this
for
that
reason
i
waited
until
i
was
really
wanting
dessert
to
have
it
the
aroma
definitely
satisfied
any
dessert
fix
that
i
might
have
wanted
but
strangely
i
find
the
flavors
not
quite
rich
enough
as
this
could
use
more
roast
malt
flavors
and
a
thicker
more
complex
malt
base
that
strangely
in
that
last
sentence
is
important
because
if
i
was
not
ready
for
the
overbearing
vanilla
and
sweetness
here
i
likely
would
have
found
this
beer
a
sickly
sweet
train
wreck
of
an
imperial
stout
properly
forewarned
with
the
right
occasion
this
beer
while
overly
simplistic
is
not
quite
half
bad
and
is
even
enjoyable
if
had
in
small
doses
southern
tier
has
absolutely
mastered
the
art
of
taking
an
ingredient
or
flavor
component
and
doing
it
to
the
extreme
this
is
just
another
example
of
that
simply
put
they
are
an
amazing
brewery
nevertheless
this
is
not
my
favorite
of
their
imperial
offerings
not
even
close
i
can
appreciate
how
well
crafted
this
is
but
the
chosen
component
to
highlight
vanilla
is
not
one
that
i
care
for
in
this
quantity
for
me
it
just
doesnt
work
terribly
well
in
fact
i
think
this
is
a
huge
miss
i
think
i
may
have
to
put
a
stopper
in
this
bomber
and
revisit
later
because
there
is
no
way
i
can
finish
this
in
a
single
evening
if
at
all
my
palate
is
destroyed
i
need
to
go
cleanse
it
this
beer
is
simply
put
nuts
its
a
great
example
of
extreme
beer
and
american
brewers
pushing
the
boundaries
of
what
beer
can
beer
bravo
southern
tier
note
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
that
ill
hang
on
to
until
the
holidays
it
seems
like
it
would
make
for
a
nice
christmas
time
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
a
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
vanilla
hazelnut
and
cocoa
quite
sweet
as
well
in
the
taste
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
bit
nutty
like
drinking
a
creme
brulee
a
smooth
big
body
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
small
bitter
cocoa
aftertaste
fantastic
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
hides
the
10
and
easy
to
drink
overall
absolutely
loved
this
1
this
is
definitely
something
you
should
drink
with
dessert
but
i
had
2
pints
and
it
was
a
delicious
finish
to
my
evening
if
you
want
flavored
coffee
drink
a
flavored
coffee
im
sure
some
purists
panties
are
bunching
every
time
baileys
gets
added
to
java
however
if
you
want
a
well
crafted
stout
that
tastes
much
like
creme
brulee
drink
this
overall
an
interesting
experiment
but
a
beer
in
nmae
only
personally
i
think
beers
like
this
give
craft
beer
a
bad
name
for
noncraft
drinkers
beers
like
this
potentially
pigeon
hole
all
craft
beer
as
gimmicky
and
undrinkable
this
bottle
was
split
3
ways
if
i
had
more
than
8
oz
at
a
time
that
might
be
pushing
it
as
far
as
drinkablity
goes
worth
a
try
for
sure
ill
be
getting
another
one
to
make
a
float
with
22
ouncer
pours
pretty
much
black
under
a
mocha
frothy
head
that
leaves
tons
of
fine
sheeting
nose
is
loaded
wvanilla
and
sweetsugary
milk
shake
notes
yummy
smooth
easy
drinking
and
most
undeniably
sweet
vanilla
honey
more
vanilla
toasted
sugar
candi
sugar
sweet
sweet
coffee
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
pleasant
desert
stout
id
like
to
try
it
with
a
chocolaty
concoction
taste
the
beer
was
extremely
sweet
with
notable
sugars
on
all
ends
of
the
palet
the
thick
creamy
liquid
was
almost
syrupy
on
the
tongue
and
left
strong
flavors
of
cocoa
butterscotch
and
caramel
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
hints
of
alcohol
overall
the
beer
was
extremely
enjoyable
best
if
served
after
dinner
as
a
desert
the
only
downside
is
that
the
rich
syrupy
texture
and
extreme
sweetness
made
repeat
drinks
difficult
making
a
bottle
best
if
shared
with
friends
cheers
i
liked
this
one
but
i
could
see
how
many
would
not
like
this
the
caramel
and
vanilla
along
with
the
lactose
come
across
as
being
butterscotch
which
isnt
usually
a
likable
trait
in
beer
as
it
is
taken
as
the
usually
unlikable
diacetylwhich
i
happen
to
enjoy
in
sam
smiths
imp
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
beer
is
big
bodied
and
does
cloy
a
great
taster
or
even
finish
to
a
great
meal
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
that
you
can
have
more
than
20
ounces
or
so
poured
black
into
a
pint
glass
with
no
foam
and
no
lacing
good
lord
all
mighty
this
beer
has
the
most
incredible
smell
in
the
world
its
no
wonder
how
they
came
up
with
the
name
creme
brulee
the
big
wafts
of
vanilla
caramel
and
butterscotch
fill
the
nose
and
is
absolutely
delectable
i
could
enjoy
the
aroma
of
this
beer
for
hours
taste
is
of
vanilla
bitter
chocolate
a
bit
of
cappuccino
slightly
creamy
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
rounding
out
the
finish
this
is
like
nothing
ive
ever
tasted
i
could
swear
theres
a
vanilla
bean
floating
in
my
drink
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
low
but
thats
good
for
this
desert
beer
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
somewhat
cloying
which
keeps
the
drinkability
low
but
it
was
fantastic
nonetheless
one
bomber
was
enough
for
me
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
always
like
southern
tiers
more
mild
beers
and
been
back
and
forth
on
their
imperials
but
this
freaking
thing
is
pure
genius
loved
each
and
every
delectible
sip
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
drinkability
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
its
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
however
its
not
the
easiest
drinking
its
a
definite
sipper
and
good
after
dinner
drink
but
bring
a
friend
i
found
the
whole
bottle
to
be
fairly
tough
to
drink
by
myself
the
nose
itself
is
worth
buying
a
bottle
for
though
edit
as
delicious
as
it
is
it
became
really
cloying
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
and
that
was
just
12
of
the
bomber
share
this
with
a
few
friends
unless
they
also
package
it
in
smaller
bottles
this
is
the
most
original
beer
that
i
have
ever
tasted
it
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
caramel
sauce
it
was
sweet
and
delicious
it
had
a
thick
mouthfeel
served
ice
cold
it
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
a
milkshake
i
couldnt
sit
there
drinking
it
all
night
but
i
couldnt
think
of
anything
i
would
rather
drink
with
my
dessert
this
is
the
best
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
and
they
hide
the
fact
that
is
10
alcohol
very
well
from
the
second
i
cracked
open
the
cap
the
room
filled
with
the
sent
of
vanilla
as
far
as
smell
goes
this
the
best
smeling
beer
ever
the
tast
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
this
one
is
sweet
with
a
fair
vanilla
kiss
and
a
carmalised
malt
flavor
this
is
smouth
and
creamy
but
ther
is
just
somthing
i
am
not
real
sure
what
that
is
off
to
me
in
this
one
i
think
it
might
be
the
hop
aftertaste
on
this
one
i
would
rather
have
this
one
finish
sweet
i
think
it
will
mello
over
time
i
will
try
agan
in
a
few
years
well
do
you
want
to
drink
your
dessert
if
so
this
is
a
beer
for
you
this
is
one
of
the
most
unusual
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
color
is
dark
as
night
its
pour
was
absent
of
a
head
it
does
have
a
very
distinctive
nose
that
of
sweet
caramelhow
did
they
do
that
taste
well
it
as
close
as
can
be
to
handing
you
a
spoon
to
crack
the
burnt
sugar
crust
from
the
top
of
the
glass
as
one
can
get
the
question
begs
to
be
asked
is
that
really
a
creme
brulee
nose
or
have
we
gone
way
over
the
top
with
vanilla
is
it
aged
in
wood
giving
off
the
vanilla
is
it
extract
or
did
they
dare
to
use
vanilla
bean
which
ever
this
beer
has
a
sweetness
throughout
that
i
thought
the
alcohol
would
balance
off
all
i
get
almost
all
the
way
though
is
that
singular
taste
of
creme
caramel
with
a
sweet
vanilla
taste
that
leads
into
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
one
trick
pony
i
was
looking
for
balance
but
got
one
flavor
yes
a
very
good
flavor
and
one
which
i
personally
like
for
its
named
after
one
of
my
favorite
desserts
but
is
this
what
a
beer
should
be
shouldnt
it
be
like
a
great
piece
of
literature
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
this
beer
has
a
beginning
the
nose
of
sweetness
a
middle
of
creamy
vanilla
custard
with
no
end
its
a
beer
to
be
revisited
for
at
10
abv
i
suspect
and
hope
that
the
too
much
sweetness
will
subside
for
a
different
taste
do
give
it
a
try
just
a
wonderful
beer
great
for
dessert
and
a
great
addition
to
the
black
water
series
this
is
one
rich
beer
highly
recommend
very
drinkable
this
overall
seems
like
more
of
a
desert
beer
then
anything
else
i
am
aslo
wondering
what
some
age
will
do
to
this
one
d
i
cant
honestly
imagine
drinking
one
by
myself
pours
a
near
black
color
into
my
guinness
pint
with
an
average
cream
colored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
distinctively
butterscotch
with
some
vanilla
perhaps
some
burnt
sugar
as
well
big
on
the
butterscotch
the
taste
is
of
butterscotch
but
has
more
of
a
vanilla
presence
perhaps
a
touch
of
rum
flavor
some
woody
roasted
malt
flavors
peek
through
towards
the
end
does
it
taste
exactly
like
creme
brulee
no
similar
somewhat
this
is
more
butterscotch
than
vanilla
and
caramlizedburnt
sugar
the
taste
is
similar
to
that
of
kahlua
somewhat
like
a
white
russian
the
feel
is
big
and
well
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
silky
texture
the
brew
finishes
sweet
and
bitter
a
tad
sticky
a
big
bold
brew
for
sure
plenty
of
huge
aromas
and
flavors
its
sweet
almost
cloying
if
you
have
too
much
i
must
say
that
the
vanilla
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
another
winner
from
the
bw
series
d
oh
definitely
a
desert
beer
very
sweet
creme
brulee
flavors
are
very
rich
very
pleased
with
this
beer
d
damn
they
did
it
again
simply
amazing
how
the
hell
do
you
get
this
kind
of
smelltaste
out
of
a
beer
i
dont
even
want
to
know
how
they
did
this
another
golden
gem
from
southern
tier
perhaps
a
blend
of
this
and
choklat
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
coffee
cream
than
creme
brulee
but
the
effect
is
similar
of
a
sweet
vanilla
and
coffee
and
chocolate
dessert
beer
very
little
to
complain
about
if
you
dig
that
combination
of
flavors
well
worth
the
effort
if
so
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
im
hoping
the
vanilla
fades
just
a
bit
d
its
delicious
and
drinkable
but
certainly
not
to
quickly
all
the
sugar
gets
the
alcohol
going
a
little
faster
too
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
very
minimal
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
aroma
is
burnt
sugar
caramel
vanilla
a
little
chocolate
and
bit
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
smells
exactly
as
advertised
like
a
sugary
desert
taste
follows
the
smell
to
a
tee
i
had
to
look
at
the
bottle
twice
to
see
if
this
was
artificially
flavored
and
it
appears
not
to
be
tastes
like
dessert
gets
a
bit
sweet
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
thick
sticky
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
grainy
as
in
grains
of
sugar
full
body
and
ample
carbonation
certainly
a
different
beer
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
is
not
something
i
would
drink
often
i
would
call
this
a
dessert
beer
one
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
another
one
outside
the
box
from
southern
tier
great
job
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
quite
cloying
certainly
a
dessert
beer
and
a
sipper
too
good
body
and
carbonation
wonderful
blend
of
flavors
alcohol
is
slightly
noticable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
a
dessert
beer
if
you
wanted
to
be
retarded
you
could
have
it
with
ice
cream
i
suppose
but
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
i
wouldnt
want
to
eat
anything
with
it
edit
only
for
spelling
errors
my
english
teachers
would
frown
so
bad
really
a
great
beer
no
dessert
necessary
as
long
as
you
have
some
creme
brulee
ims
around
comments
i
couldnt
see
drinking
this
as
anything
but
an
afterdinner
digestif
perhaps
not
unlike
one
might
have
a
very
sweet
framboise
at
the
end
of
a
meal
i
couldnt
drink
another
beer
before
or
after
this
one
for
what
thats
worth
it
is
dessert
in
a
bottle
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
glad
i
bought
several
drinkability
obviously
not
a
session
beer
but
this
stuff
is
delicious
sip
and
enjoy
liquid
dessert
indeed
ive
got
some
questions
for
phin
hopefully
i
can
talk
to
him
a
bit
tomorrow
at
the
publick
house
mouthfeel
is
nice
good
carbonation
smooth
feel
but
again
its
very
sweet
being
how
sweet
it
is
i
have
to
make
the
drink
ability
a
3
5
dwas
i
hoping
for
choklat
in
creme
brulee
form
yes
did
i
get
it
yes
this
is
another
fantastic
accomplishment
by
the
brewers
of
st
alcohol
a
bit
more
present
and
limiting
feeling
than
in
choklat
this
is
a
sipper
and
one
to
be
enjoyed
s
l
o
w
l
y
but
enjoyed
it
will
be
d
is
very
nice
and
smooth
has
a
very
sugary
taste
reminiscent
of
its
namesake
dessert
quite
interesting
dthis
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
session
because
of
its
abv
would
go
great
with
lots
of
deserts
dif
youre
looking
to
drink
45
of
these
at
a
frat
party
its
not
going
to
happen
youll
get
diabetes
and
a
mouthful
of
cavities
drink
or
split
one
after
dinner
and
thatll
be
enough
i
have
liked
other
southern
tier
brews
including
other
blackwater
offerings
but
in
our
opinions
this
one
misses
the
mark
d
when
i
first
took
my
initial
sip
i
was
blown
away
what
a
delicious
beer
but
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
became
difficult
to
finish
due
the
sweetness
this
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with
some
typw
of
robust
food
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
overall
a
really
nice
and
different
beer
but
is
probably
best
shared
with
a
friend
or
two
a
glass
would
do
me
just
fine
milk
chocolate
vanilla
and
coffee
the
body
is
medium
and
silky
the
finish
is
rather
sweet
and
hints
of
vanilla
vanilla
is
obviously
the
strongest
component
of
this
beer
which
i
guess
represents
the
milk
a
good
beer
if
sweeter
than
i
like
for
this
style
d
a
sweet
beer
that
makes
a
nice
sipper
for
dessert
anyway
southern
tier
surprised
me
again
with
this
beer
and
how
amazing
they
are
well
done
at
first
sip
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
carmelized
sugars
and
vanilla
rise
up
on
the
palate
this
sweetness
continues
well
into
the
finish
with
a
mild
bitterness
during
the
aftertaste
flavors
of
chocolate
vanilla
toffee
linger
on
the
palate
for
ages
after
the
final
swallow
making
this
beer
a
delight
unbelievable
beer
outstanding
this
example
could
have
used
more
carbonation
to
cut
the
syrupy
texture
will
most
likely
try
another
and
compare
notes
gets
an
a
for
impact
though
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
a
full
finger
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
surface
the
smell
is
aggressive
and
consuming
a
rich
vanilla
sweet
butterscotch
aroma
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
without
being
syrupy
full
flavored
the
taste
matches
up
to
the
smell
directly
with
a
light
hint
of
coffee
the
lactose
sugar
gives
it
a
distinct
over
cooked
milk
character
thats
creamy
a
real
sipper
approaching
over
sweet
a
truly
unique
beverage
take
one
for
a
spin
bring
ice
cream
the
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
the
smell
is
just
fantastic
vanilla
caramel
and
all
things
that
make
a
creamy
dessert
are
present
the
taste
is
just
as
yummy
i
drank
this
one
out
of
a
refrigerator
and
it
started
out
good
and
as
it
warmed
it
got
even
better
although
this
thing
is
delicious
the
drinkability
isnt
its
best
strength
its
pretty
damn
filling
as
it
should
be
its
a
creamy
dessert
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
imperial
stouts
from
what
is
becoming
my
favorite
brewer
in
southern
tier
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
smooth
itll
be
very
interesting
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
beer
just
a
shade
shy
of
pitch
black
with
a
surprisingly
light
tan
slight
head
that
quickly
becomes
just
a
ring
leaves
some
lace
but
not
enough
to
get
excited
about
smell
is
sweet
it
smells
like
creme
brulee
i
mean
almost
exactly
like
creme
brulee
loads
of
vanilla
and
some
cocoa
no
perceptible
alcohol
or
yeast
here
taste
follows
exactly
where
you
would
expect
it
to
loads
of
vanilla
some
marshmallow
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
actually
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
creme
brulee
flavored
salt
water
taffy
but
im
not
sure
why
this
comes
across
as
more
of
a
liqueur
than
a
beer
but
again
no
detectable
alcohol
warming
feel
is
thick
and
somewhat
viscous
drinkability
is
low
mostly
due
to
the
almost
overwhelming
sweetness
well
worth
a
try
if
only
for
the
uniqueness
splendidly
complicated
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
pours
a
pretty
dark
black
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
nose
is
so
heavy
with
vanilla
that
it
reminds
me
of
coffeemate
vanilla
whateveritmaybe
highly
sugared
very
sweet
flavor
is
sweet
as
well
it
really
almost
hijacks
the
experience
but
there
is
a
slight
roasted
edge
that
kind
of
adds
a
slightly
different
dimension
to
it
that
helps
keep
it
interesting
overall
though
it
is
very
sweet
and
knowing
how
big
the
bottle
is
ahead
of
me
im
not
really
sure
how
i
am
going
to
drink
it
all
feel
is
smooth
on
the
liquid
and
i
mean
rrrreeeal
smooth
carbonation
is
low
but
as
it
should
be
this
is
very
drinkable
yes
i
think
the
problem
is
that
the
bottle
is
a
bomber
22
ounces
i
mean
come
on
you
need
to
share
this
with
a
party
of
six
people
to
keep
it
pleasureable
as
a
side
note
to
all
brewers
the
first
person
to
brew
this
kind
of
thing
and
bottle
it
in
say
a
6
or
7
ounce
bottle
might
have
something
interesting
on
their
hands
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
yet
another
well
made
and
interesting
beer
from
southern
tier
i
dont
know
what
happened
to
their
brains
over
there
but
hey
keep
it
up
i
definately
prefered
both
the
oat
and
the
chocolate
over
this
one
edit
have
sample
this
several
more
times
and
have
found
the
drinkability
scale
to
have
gone
down
for
me
a
bit
just
finding
it
too
rich
to
really
quaff
well
also
the
flavors
have
risen
on
the
sweeter
scale
for
me
changing
palate
i
suppose
still
wonderful
stuff
another
winner
in
the
series
st
definitely
hits
a
home
run
here
after
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
for
those
who
thought
that
the
imperial
cherry
saison
should
have
had
bolder
cherry
tones
upward
and
onward
to
pumpking
creme
brulee
pours
a
beautiful
dark
dark
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
a
sticky
quickly
dissapating
head
fills
up
a
bunch
of
the
pint
glass
when
i
pour
the
aroma
is
overwhelming
really
beautiful
huge
vanilla
and
cream
smells
as
intense
as
the
jahva
and
choklat
black
water
brews
before
it
a
rich
intense
beer
drinking
experience
no
real
hints
of
the
huge
abv
here
pretty
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
wise
but
the
flavor
is
so
intense
that
i
would
be
shocked
if
someone
could
drink
two
of
these
in
a
row
kind
of
like
eating
two
creme
brulees
in
a
row
why
even
try
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
lot
of
killer
qualities
that
could
easily
be
cloying
and
terrible
but
just
isnt
another
winner
from
st
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
almost
like
caramel
ice
cream
deep
rich
vanilla
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
malt
very
slight
carbonation
and
a
rich
and
slick
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipping
beer
which
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
southern
tier
is
going
into
uncharted
waters
and
making
some
damn
fine
beers
going
into
my
top
three
along
with
ommegangs
chocolate
indulgence
and
lindemans
framboise
i
took
my
time
with
this
guy
as
i
wanted
to
savor
it
and
it
took
me
nearly
two
hours
to
get
through
the
whole
bottle
i
wasnt
struggling
by
any
means
it
is
just
such
a
rich
flavor
profile
that
i
really
had
to
slow
my
pace
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
lower
carbonation
with
a
flavor
that
completely
coats
the
palate
almost
viscous
without
the
cloying
qualities
this
is
what
extreme
beer
is
all
about
not
to
be
consumed
with
dessert
but
as
dessert
ssmell
is
absolutely
outstanding
butterscotch
tons
of
vanilla
and
a
faint
tootsie
roll
smell
tmtaste
is
fantastic
loads
of
sweet
vanilla
burnt
sugars
chocolate
and
a
tad
of
butterscotch
round
this
out
with
a
nice
alcohol
creaminess
on
the
finish
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
gave
it
a
4
this
beer
is
a
little
rich
and
very
sweet
but
it
is
also
quite
drinkable
considering
its
hefty
10
abv
all
in
all
another
fantastic
beer
from
southern
tiers
black
water
series
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
buy
this
one
as
soon
as
they
can
because
im
sure
there
will
be
a
ton
of
beer
trekys
stockpiling
it
in
the
next
few
weeks
as
long
as
you
have
taste
buds
youll
enjoy
this
its
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
had
has
to
be
the
best
desert
beer
out
there
if
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
though
you
are
my
hero
its
a
very
filling
beer
job
well
done
southern
tier
d
this
may
be
the
most
tastiest
beer
ive
ever
had
it
ranks
right
up
there
w
utopias
because
of
its
uniqueness
but
i
have
a
feeling
one
okay
two
and
done
it
had
to
rhyme
right
how
about
two
and
thru
pours
black
with
the
faintest
brown
highlights
at
the
edges
small
tan
head
fades
pretty
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
smell
in
all
likelihood
this
is
the
most
impressive
smelling
beer
ive
ever
had
the
vanilla
bean
is
just
exploding
out
of
the
glass
sweet
melting
butterscotch
and
just
a
tiny
bit
of
milk
chocolate
trying
to
claw
its
way
through
the
vanilla
bean
taste
is
all
about
the
bean
crazy
amount
of
vanilla
bean
flavor
just
overwhelms
the
palate
with
its
sweetness
this
truly
is
a
dessert
beer
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
on
the
back
end
nothing
overt
silky
mouthfeel
not
too
sticky
given
all
the
sweetness
at
10
this
one
is
perfect
for
sharing
really
just
a
fantastic
effort
from
southern
tier
wow
edit
had
on
tap
at
sunset
bar
and
grill
and
flavors
were
pretty
different
the
sweetness
was
much
more
mild
and
the
maltiness
came
out
a
bit
more
it
also
had
a
drier
feel
to
it
still
good
but
a
good
drop
off
from
the
bottle
o
the
elements
for
a
great
stout
are
all
here
the
main
issue
here
is
that
the
acridity
is
dialed
a
bit
forward
the
sweetness
a
bit
too
far
back
and
the
end
result
is
a
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
had
the
nitro
version
on
tap
alcohol
very
present
in
the
nose
with
the
toasted
malt
honestly
should
be
a
lower
abv
beer
like
most
other
milk
stouts
leaves
an
alcohol
taste
not
bad
but
not
what
i
want
from
a
sweet
stout
other
than
that
good
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
super
easy
to
drink
and
a
really
tasty
beer
good
coffee
taste
on
the
front
had
a
draft
of
this
at
lunch
today
not
sweet
at
all
very
good
overall
a
bit
too
thin
toasty
hoppy
out
of
balance
to
the
hop
dry
side
o
on
the
sweeter
side
but
it
has
all
the
dark
malt
flavours
that
you
could
want
a
bit
bitter
as
well
not
the
greatest
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
great
feel
and
taste
consistently
excellent
not
crazy
alcohol
so
can
enjoy
a
few
readily
available
in
pittsburgh
area
tasted
too
high
alcohol
without
enough
other
flavor
for
me
mm
mm
this
beer
tastes
like
espresso
decent
finish
reasonable
intensity
delicious
sweet
burnt
chocolate
taste
with
a
great
coffee
aftertaste
great
coffeelike
smell
was
a
very
weak
stout
way
two
thin
for
a
double
milk
i
didnt
care
much
for
it
strong
stout
with
substantial
dark
lightly
sweet
flavors
strong
dessert
overall
this
is
another
great
milksweet
stout
and
another
great
beer
from
southern
tier
great
flavors
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
caramel
all
wrapped
up
in
a
creamy
quaff
delicious
ok
no
better
with
age
another
great
beer
from
stbc
nice
smooth
taste
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
milk
well
above
average
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
this
beer
is
by
no
means
bad
but
the
dominant
coffee
flavor
drowns
out
some
of
the
enjoyable
complexities
found
in
many
other
milk
stouts
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
coffee
flavoring
in
your
stouts
this
may
well
be
the
brew
for
you
but
others
may
want
to
look
elsewhere
very
good
milk
stout
enjoyed
it
aromaboozy
jusy
plain
lighy
head
that
disappears
in
minutes
heavy
and
lacking
flavor
creamy
and
just
overall
a
boozy
plain
beer
not
a
fan
this
was
far
too
sweet
for
me
but
pretty
typical
of
the
style
not
a
big
fan
of
milk
stouts
this
one
was
had
too
thin
of
a
mouthfeel
and
the
aroma
was
almost
non
existent
o
i
would
drink
this
again
the
smells
and
the
flavors
werent
overpowering
and
there
didnt
seem
to
be
anything
dominant
only
primary
roast
coffee
i
didnt
care
for
the
mild
bitter
finish
but
it
wasnt
a
deal
breaker
on
tap
creamiest
damn
beer
ive
ever
had
a
really
good
dark
roast
coffee
with
a
slight
espresso
flavor
i
like
this
good
milk
stout
but
not
my
favorite
think
if
i
had
it
on
a
nitro
line
it
would
really
help
smooth
it
out
would
recommend
or
drink
again
definitely
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
out
there
the
color
is
great
and
all
the
elements
come
together
nicely
to
make
a
solid
product
it
finishes
nicely
and
has
a
nice
lingering
taste
nitro
sweet
slightly
roasty
creamy
just
a
little
above
average
its
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
only
got
a
few
swigs
my
girl
drank
most
of
it
pretty
smooth
nice
feel
and
fairly
stouty
overall
straight
simple
and
to
the
point
my
review
that
is
id
like
this
stout
to
be
a
tad
sweeter
but
overall
a
great
beer
pours
opaque
nearblack
mahogany
perhaps
the
labeling
set
my
expectation
though
im
sure
the
aroma
hints
of
sweetness
flavors
of
dark
roast
and
sweet
milk
from
the
teat
of
a
goddess
smooth
and
strong
the
drinkability
portends
to
danger
served
on
nitro
more
bitter
than
sweet
or
smooth
mild
chocolate
finish
this
is
not
a
real
big
stout
and
i
like
the
creamy
sweetness
of
this
one
some
chocolate
in
the
malt
and
maybe
to
much
coffee
not
what
i
would
consider
creamy
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
thin
either
overall
a
nice
little
stout
that
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
that
i
would
seek
out
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
were
offered
one
but
i
dont
see
me
paying
for
another
one
either
dark
chocolate
brown
cow
appearance
and
light
mocha
head
not
that
sweet
in
presentation
but
has
some
nagging
cloying
properties
the
lactose
is
definitely
there
but
the
roast
coffee
flavors
predominate
and
it
finishes
with
a
nice
char
very
breadydark
german
pumpernickle
and
barley
flavors
are
spot
on
a
little
weak
in
the
nose
but
the
too
thin
too
sticky
mouthfeel
hurts
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
up
front
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
middle
with
roasted
malt
notes
smooth
to
the
finish
with
slight
bitter
herb
and
floral
notes
rjt
had
this
from
a
nitro
tap
at
southern
tier
and
it
was
the
best
ive
had
in
some
time
creamy
smooth
and
a
perfect
balance
im
certain
it
isnt
as
good
from
a
bottle
but
if
you
have
the
chance
to
get
it
from
a
nitro
tap
get
it
and
enjoy
wife
loves
it
for
its
lack
of
sweetness
i
tried
this
from
a
nitropushed
tap
which
adds
to
its
creamy
character
this
is
not
a
hophead
beer
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
my
friends
who
like
those
burnt
coffee
tasting
stouts
this
is
just
a
well
made
american
version
of
a
not
quite
traditional
irish
stout
lots
of
roasty
chocolate
in
the
nose
some
lactose
sweetness
as
well
pretty
on
dimensional
but
i
like
it
i
tasted
a
little
milky
sweetness
but
it
was
definitely
in
the
back
round
hugely
sweet
chocolate
and
plenty
of
roasty
char
dominate
this
one
again
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
bottle
another
mediocre
offering
from
southern
tier
the
burnt
taste
is
pervasive
and
has
a
long
hang
time
fortunately
the
sweetness
makes
this
tolerable
incidentally
i
like
stouts
just
not
this
one
the
burnt
taste
is
just
too
overpowering
in
the
absence
of
any
chocolate
or
coffee
flavors
rating
b
black
pour
with
a
tan
onefinger
head
aroma
of
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
creamy
and
sweet
flavor
with
a
light
roasted
malt
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
flavors
upfront
also
has
a
slight
bitter
coffeeespresso
flavor
on
the
backend
medium
bodied
a
bit
too
bitter
imo
but
not
bad
great
if
you
want
to
get
buzzed
quicker
o
very
good
not
one
of
my
favorite
southern
tier
stout
but
certainly
worth
a
try
4
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
i
prefer
my
milksweet
stouts
to
be
a
bit
fuller
in
body
and
a
have
a
little
more
sweetness
from
the
lactose
o
ive
always
enjoyed
sts
stout
offerings
and
never
had
one
let
me
down
what
we
have
here
is
a
nice
sturdy
double
milk
stout
that
hits
all
the
expected
notes
while
clocking
in
at
a
higher
abv
than
what
is
apparent
and
all
while
remaining
remarkably
smooth
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
would
put
the
2x
stout
on
par
with
the
likes
of
sam
adams
cream
stout
lh
milk
stout
nitro
nicely
done
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
large
frozen
beer
mug
bottle
has
dob
of
62714
stamped
below
the
label
pours
a
deep
brown
with
sparks
of
light
coming
through
delicious
sandy
head
with
an
okay
lace
taste
is
of
chocolaty
malt
with
a
good
hop
aftertaste
to
balance
there
is
a
slight
creamy
mouthfeel
i
love
stouts
but
the
hops
make
this
one
the
best
of
both
worlds
i
cant
see
myself
getting
bored
of
this
brew
overall
good
but
not
outstanding
i
would
be
more
interested
in
trying
it
without
the
nitro
i
was
unaware
it
would
be
on
nitro
when
ordering
i
think
the
nitro
may
have
steam
rolled
some
of
the
flavor
a
good
taste
and
good
value
if
you
want
to
both
drink
a
stout
and
catch
a
buzz
overall
a
lot
to
like
with
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
staple
in
my
house
my
wife
is
head
over
heels
for
it
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
snifter
pitch
black
body
with
a
very
minimal
brownish
head
that
was
gone
in
an
instant
def
what
a
stout
should
look
like
in
my
opinion
smelled
of
cocoa
molasses
a
hint
of
coffee
coming
thorough
from
the
dark
malts
with
a
bit
of
agitation
very
coffeeforward
taste
which
might
explain
my
wifes
obsession
and
some
nice
deep
dark
malts
just
enough
bitterness
to
offset
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
low
level
of
carbonation
that
kept
it
from
being
to
viscous
very
excited
that
i
will
be
able
to
grab
one
of
these
out
of
the
fridge
every
once
in
a
while
when
she
isnt
looking
nice
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
is
a
few
shades
lighter
than
black
fairly
opaque
it
doesnt
allow
much
light
through
but
does
throw
some
highlights
on
the
edges
the
head
is
about
a
finger
thick
light
tan
bubbles
that
fall
to
a
thin
layer
in
some
time
the
smell
is
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
combined
with
lactose
sugary
sweetness
and
dark
caramels
or
light
chocolates
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
as
the
lactose
sweetness
leads
the
way
bolstered
by
the
chocolate
notes
and
finished
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
hop
aroma
and
flavor
is
nearly
nonexistent
there
may
be
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
coming
from
hops
with
the
bulk
from
the
malt
trends
a
bit
towards
the
sweet
side
especially
up
front
while
the
body
is
incredibly
creamy
and
smooth
both
due
to
the
lactose
and
a
high
level
of
fine
bubbled
carbonation
overall
a
good
stout
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
so
personally
im
not
thrilled
by
this
beer
but
would
say
that
it
is
well
done
and
should
be
liked
by
fans
of
milk
stouts

but
it
paled
in
comparison
to
choklat
oat
the
palate
opens
with
an
enjoyable
creamy
chocolate
flavor
thats
surprisingly
bold
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
bill
makes
this
taste
closer
to
a
3540
cocoa
chocolate
compared
to
the
nose
some
sweet
coffee
flavor
is
present
as
well
all
told
a
little
sweeter
than
it
needs
to
be
with
the
caramelsugar
notes
dominating
the
lactose
flavor
thats
also
present
a
very
smooth
roasted
malt
flavor
is
present
lending
a
mild
bitterness
in
an
attempt
to
balance
the
sweetness
lactose
lingers
on
the
finish
leaving
sweetness
a
little
bitterness
and
some
coffee
medium
in
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
feels
quite
nice
on
the
palate
ultimately
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
roasted
malt
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
recommended
this
brew
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
is
similar
to
a
starbucks
bold
thats
been
sitting
out
all
day
definitely
a
nice
desert
beer
thats
worth
trying
overall
its
not
the
creamiest
most
smooth
milk
stout
on
the
block
but
its
still
fairly
solid
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
o
reminds
me
of
a
terrapin
wake
n
bake
with
some
lactose
sugar
and
tart
cherry
skins
thrown
in
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
rather
have
a
founders
breakfast
stout
flavorful
stout
more
sweet
chocolate
and
milky
notes
on
the
palate
sweet
but
not
near
cloying
quite
enjoyable
offering
nice
with
any
sort
of
chocolate
dessert
worth
giving
a
try
overall
second
milk
stout
and
it
is
honestly
notch
below
my
previous
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
regardless
a
good
beer
salud
overall
really
a
nice
sweet
stout
not
overly
sweet
at
all
very
well
balanced
and
complex
not
overly
robust
or
heavy
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
would
recommend
and
try
again
overall
very
solid
brew
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
nice
lingering
sweetness
and
pretty
solid
bitterness
abv7

but
by
taste
you
wouldnt
really
know
it
the
roasted
malts
really
meld
nicely
with
the
bitterness
and
is
a
unique
stout
because
of
how
tasty
it
is
yet
not
very
thick
like
a
traditional
stout
definitely
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
my
kind
of
sitting
at
home
or
with
friends
listening
to
music
sort
of
beer
nothing
special
immediately
except
how
good
it
gets
with
warming
and
repeated
sips

12

smoke
mixed
with
some
root
beer
subtle
malts
shine
through
with
a
deep
waft
complex
and
creamy
with
mild
roast
and
mild
smoke
balancing
each
other
nicely
finishes
a
little
sweeter
with
some
caramel
lingering
but
not
overpowering
the
bitterness
of
a
stout
smooth
mouthfeel
as
a
cream
stout
should
be
very
nice
d
not
bad
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
the
flavor
profile
is
full
and
complex
it
is
unusually
dry
for
a
southern
tier
beer
and
this
seems
to
suit
it
well
giving
it
a
drinkability
that
you
would
never
get
in
most
of
their
other
stouts
o
this
was
a
solid
stout
smooth
flavors
and
aroma
with
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
i
guess
this
is
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
style
but
one
can
certainly
appreciate
what
st
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
they
did
a
darn
good
job
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
delicious
and
offers
the
best
of
the
milk
stout
with
the
best
of
the
imperialamerican
double
stout
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
nice
hop
presence
for
a
milksweet
stout
o
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
milk
stout
style
they
tend
to
be
thin
and
uninteresting
but
the
2x
stout
is
an
excellent
enjoyable
beer
overall
you
can
tell
this
is
a
southern
tier
beer
with
the
sweet
and
chocolate
tones
that
have
become
the
trademark
of
their
stouts
i
find
them
enjoyable
in
small
quantities
and
this
is
no
exception
glad
it
is
is
a
12
oz
bottle
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
although
it
has
an
added
kick
with
the
extra
strength
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
it
doesnt
have
the
creaminess
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
it
has
lots
of
chocolate
flavors

bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
while
being
fullbodied
overall
good
take
on
the
style
especially
with
the
extra
abv
way
different
than
i
expected
when
i
saw
2x
stout
but
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
unique
property
of
this
beer
is
the
mellow
roasted
flavor
which
allows
all
the
underlying
flavors
to
come
out
dont
let
to
color
of
this
beer
trick
you
it
is
a
very
mellow
and
drinkable
brew
the
body
is
on
the
heftier
side
of
medium
perhaps
verging
into
heavier
with
a
carbonation
that
is
appropriately
light
while
making
for
a
bit
of
creaminess
theres
a
good
smoothness
to
this
beer
as
well
the
nose
had
me
excited
but
the
flavor
has
a
kind
of
burnt
hoppy
oxidized
feel
that
just
doesnt
blend
out
to
well
i
find
southern
tier
beers
to
be
very
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
is
definitely
a
miss
poured
a
dark
mostlyblack
color
with
a
thin
wispy
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
almost
completely
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
not
much
on
the
aroma
some
roasty
malts
touch
of
cocoa
taste
was
really
very
bland
and
onedimensional
with
simple
dark
roasted
malts
and
distant
notes
of
cocoa
and
mild
hops
tannin
astringency
abounds
dry
finish
with
no
flavor
lingering
thin
and
watery
lightbodied
for
the
style
and
really
nothing
here
that
would
inspire
me
to
order
the
beer
again
o
a
decent
enough
stout
to
enjoy
every
once
in
a
while
o
nice
milk
stout
with
good
amount
of
hoppiness
which
i
like
great
brew
here
i
love
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
only
get
a
little
bit
of
the
abv
in
the
end
almost
like
an
imperial
milk
stout
great
brew
here
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
heavy
for
a
stout
but
certainly
not
too
thin
id
go
with
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
level
with
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
finish
well
balanced
and
full
flavor
nothing
not
to
like
a
solid
offering
from
southern
tier
od
this
is
the
type
of
beer
where
one
aspect
ruins
all
the
positives
the
hop
bitterness
of
this
is
not
only
out
of
style
but
its
off
putting
and
clashes
with
the
sweet
chocolate
and
toast
characteristics
not
something
id
get
again
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
a
sweet
stout
to
be
it
is
a
mighty
good
stout
though
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
double
milk
stout
i
was
skeptical
but
now
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
onot
a
bad
stout
but
not
the
best
from
southern
tier
i
would
get
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
o
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
stout
offering
from
this
brewery
nice
flavors
but
just
not
as
exceptional
as
some
of
the
others
enjoy
the
dryness
in
the
finish
of
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
just
not
sure
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
myself
as
i
prefer
some
other
stouts
more
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
wow
this
is
so
drinkable
its
crazy
its
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
definitely
try
if
you
like
a
sweet
stout
that
is
incredibly
drinkable
a
really
tasty
milk
stout
alcohol
well
hidden
seems
more
session
than
imperial
recommended
another
good
st
brew
overall
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
4
0
more
subdued
than
i
was
expecting
honestly
considering
how
sweet
some
of
southern
tiers
beers
are
especially
the
higherabv
brewsi
think
the
only
really
dry
one
i
can
think
of
is
2xipa
this
is
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
a
nice
wellputtogether
stout
that
any
lover
of
dark
beers
would
enjoy
even
if
theyre
not
blown
away
by
it
but
also
a
very
good
place
to
start
for
anyone
looking
to
develop
a
greater
appreciation
of
stouts
another
quality
offering
from
a
superb
american
craft
brewer
tough
to
disagree
with
most
things
southern
tier
o
about
part
for
the
course
but
still
very
good
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
in
this
one
and
you
get
a
nice
bang
for
your
buck
with
it
most
milk
stouts
cost
roughly
the
same
about
per
sixer
and
have
much
less
alcohol
this
was
the
last
of
my
six
pack
and
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
7
5
abv
is
very
hard
to
notice
just
a
slight
warming
in
the
finish
and
in
the
belly
another
solid
example
from
southern
tier
o
this
is
actually
kind
of
bitter
for
a
cream
stout
there
is
a
good
roasty
quality
to
it
along
with
some
light
tones
of
milk
not
bad
o
a
decent
beer
but
my
feeling
is
this
beer
is
going
in
too
many
directions
the
hops
tend
to
throw
off
the
overall
roast
and
sweetness
a
bit
i
wouldnt
mind
if
the
body
was
just
a
bit
fuller
too
some
detectable
alcohol
on
the
swallow
wouldnt
know
it
was
a
milk
stout
at
all
by
tasting
it
the
palate
is
smooth
lighter
than
a
regular
stout
would
be
coating
the
tongue
are
rich
malt
flavors
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
malts
all
take
center
stage
brewed
with
2
hop
varieties
the
finish
releases
the
perfect
touch
of
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
smoke
2x
stout
is
a
pretty
good
release
from
southern
tier
its
not
among
their
best
but
it
is
okay
the
biggest
issues
with
this
one
are
the
odd
dark
fruit
flavor
and
the
strong
burnt
flavor
on
the
tail
if
those
two
things
were
addressed
itd
be
improved
its
really
not
bad
as
it
is
though
worth
checking
out
yeah
it
is
o
a
decent
offering
from
southern
tier
was
hoping
for
more
having
tasted
several
of
their
other
stouts
perhaps
i
am
judging
this
brew
to
harshly
mouthfeel
is
like
other
cream
stouts
not
very
much
carbonation
medium
bodied
this
tastes
fantastic
in
a
cask
overall
a
decent
milk
stout
that
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
it
is
not
as
big
as
the
2x
ipa
but
it
is
satisfying
i
enjoy
this
its
deep
heavy
good
chocolate
flavor
that
doesnt
taste
fake
that
is
paired
with
a
slight
acidic
componnet
i
also
like
the
alchol
being
slightly
noticeable
but
while
i
enjoy
it
i
also
find
it
distracting
interesting
take
for
sure
though
2x
sout
is
an
ok
milk
stout
but
its
too
big
and
too
hot
for
me
especially
considering
the
actual
abv
isnt
huge
i
tend
to
think
of
milk
stouts
as
being
smooth
and
light
on
the
alcohol
flavors
which
i
like
im
guessing
that
just
isnt
what
southern
tier
was
going
for
here
and
it
reminds
of
one
of
their
big
flavored
stouts
without
a
ton
of
sweetness
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
interested
in
a
big
milk
stout
which
southern
tier
does
a
lot
of
and
does
them
pretty
well
overall
i
like
this
one
but
this
is
a
two
in
a
sitting
max
due
to
the
sweetness
one
of
southern
tiers
better
smaller
bottles
i
really
hope
they
continue
with
producing
quality
beer
in
small
sizes
i
will
look
for
this
again
othis
actually
reminds
me
of
a
pure
old
time
english
stout
i
like
this
a
lot
its
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
in
fact
a
case
of
this
might
not
last
long
if
you
get
this
dont
plan
on
being
blown
out
of
the
water
but
i
bet
youll
be
impressed
overall
i
liked
the
2xipa
so
i
knew
i
would
like
this
wonder
if
a
case
of
this
is
around
40
bucks
like
the
2xipa
since
it
might
be
the
best
stout
buy
in
town
a
good
stout
that
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
stouts
id
drink
it
again
but
like
the
blackwater
series
much
more
o
well
next
time
i
see
the
thread
best
value
or
best
bang
for
your
buck
or
best
cheap
imperial
stout
this
one
will
definitely
have
to
be
mentioned
at
under
2
bucks
a
bottle
for
this
flavorful
and
high
octane
stout
i
encourage
you
to
try
to
find
a
better
deal
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
series
thus
far
from
southern
tier
and
would
like
to
see
more
variations
o
this
is
a
nice
stout
that
is
not
overly
lactic
and
has
good
hop
presence
as
well
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
which
detracts
from
it
somewhat
overall
a
drinkable
stout
that
i
would
have
again
o
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
i
head
good
things
so
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
if
i
run
into
it
at
a
bar
i
may
ask
for
a
swig
to
give
it
another
chance
and
if
someone
has
a
free
one
for
me
id
give
it
an
honest
mulligan
but
boy
was
this
glass
bad
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black

behind

in
the
taste
lots
of
sweet
lactose

sugar

there
is
a
light
smokey
component
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through

creamy
and
oh
so
smooth

this
is
a
very

checking

an

it
is

still
a

youd
expect

o
not

really
not

favorite
representation
of
the
style
i
preferred
terrapin
moohoo
and
riverhorse
oatmeal

stout
a
decent
big
milk
stout
but
the
alcohol
does
not
hide
very
well
in
it
o
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
more
bitterness
to
counteract
the
sweetness
than
i
would
expect
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
not
as
wonderful
as
some
of
this
breweries
other
offerings
but
it
outdoes
the
blackwater
series
in
the
area
of
balance
those
beers
are
entirely
onenoted

if
they

some

a
great

of
a

stout
o
good
stuff
creamy
and
tastes
like
a
milk
stout
should
score
bumped
up
here
to
reflect
overall
impression
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
carbonation
more
on
the
low
side
with
a
surprisingly
slightly
dry
finish
which
i
didnt
expect
considering
its
a
milk
stout
drinkability
was
alright
considering
its
7
5
abv
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
compared
to
other
milk
stouts
id
wager
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
some
room
for
improvement
inceasing
the
mouthfeel
reducing
the
smokeacrid
notes
and
upping
the
lactose
would
improve
this
one
i
was
let
down
a
little
but
had
high
expectations
the
quality
of
this
would
mirror
something
like
choklat
or
mocha
but
alas
it
does
not
4
0
d
very
nice
beer
worth
a
purchase
or
two
solid
all
around
o
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
after
my
friends
recommendation
though
i
wasnt
turned
off
by
it
the
beer
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
as
much
as
id
hoped
it
would
bc
tastemilk
chocolate
coffee
with
cream
subtle
hop
prescence
in
the
back
ground
very
smooth
and
sweet
but
not
overly
so
well
balanced
recommended
all
in
all
a
good
offering
that
i
may
go
back
to
from
time
to
time
if
it
comes
out
again
i
think
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
is
plenty
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
solid
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
a
stout
that
i
would
surely
recommend
d
really
nice
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
it
again
either
the
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
the
heavier
side
and
pretty
creamy
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
stye
the
sweeter
creamy
lactose
was
a
very
nice
compliment
to
the
bolder
roasted
malts
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
nice
one
of
the
style
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
not
too
heavy
but
heavy
enough
overall
the
amount
of
vanilla
and
cream
was
well
done
but
still
not
all
that
memorable
for
me
i
want
to
love
this
beer
i
want
like
this
beer
i
read
the
reviews
man
im
in
a
slump
ita
a
milk
stout
why
does
it
leave
a
boozy
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
oh
but
what
a
frist
taste
and
going
down
is
mighty
fine
dont
know
what
else
to
say
at
7
5
that
too
high
drink
and
enjoy
it
dark
nothing
finer
then
that
all
i
need
ot
remember
is
southern
tier
2x
that
great
im
expecting
the
sweetness
to
come
through
loud
and
clear
with
a
milk
stout
but
its
not
happening
for
me
its
got
more
hopiness
taste
than
what
id
expect
in
a
milk
stout
or
maybe
that
is
alcohol
coming
through
id
call
it
a
big
beer
and
i
pretty
much
like
anything
in
that
category
im
not
picking
up
what
id
call
a
refined
smell
kind
of
rawness
about
it
to
my
nose
contrary
to
some
other
posts
im
not
finding
this
to
be
high
in
smoothness
im
getting
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
if
this
was
a
style
that
would
get
better
with
age
then
that
is
what
id
recommend
to
make
it
better

with

a

a

chocolate

and
a
very
good

solid

no

not

nor
too
roasty
this
should
prove
popular
hoppy
taste
is
rather
subdued
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
im
impressed
with
this
stout
the
sweet
and
sour
lactic
notes
are
muted
it
certainly
has
a
double
stout
taste
and
feel
to
it
and
it
never
comes
across
as
cloying
or
syrupy
after
being
underwhelmed
by
previous
southern
tier
offerings
i
would
consider
this
a
definite
must
try
and
would
highly
recommend
for
winter
time
consumption
overallvery
impressed
with
this
beer
not
your
everyday
stout
has
a
great
drinkability
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
all
together
i
think
this
is
a
decent
milk
stout
but
the
bitter
finish
sort
of
threw
me
off
i
would
have
liked
to
have
kept
the
sweetness
throughout
i
did
it
in
enjoy
this
though
and
hope
that
southern
tier
continues
to
make
more
beers
in
this
2x
series
im
currently
drinking
this
the
day
after
a
snowstorm
and
its
doing
a
good
job
of
hitting
the
spot
pours
a
deep
chocolate
brown
with
a
very
thin
beige
head
not
much
lacing
at
all
smell
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
toasty
and
nutty
medium
bodied
nice
and
creamy
but
just
a
touch
of
hops
nice
chocolate
sweetness
the
lactose
is
nice
with
the
bittering
hops
seems
like
a
dry
finish
but
how
can
that
be
with
a
sweet
stout
it
works
overall
impression
a
big
roasty
milk
stout
seems
a
little
hop
forward
for
the
style
and
definitely
too
big
but
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
overall
the
flavors
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
guess
i
expected
a
little
more
from
southern
tier
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
poured
into
an
overshaped
chalice
i
get
deep
dark
abyss
absorbs
all
visible
light
in
the
body
big
mocha
tan
head
forms
thick
like
a
barista
just
made
me
something
special
with
extra
froth
fine
even
lacing
between
sips
pretty
nice
looking
effort
from
upstate
ny
arom
i
get
dusted
cocoa
creamy
milk
chocolate
candy
offerings
with
some
dry
roasted
malt
notes
flavor
is
super
sweet
coats
the
sides
of
the
palate
rushes
you
with
a
sweet
chocolate
syrup
notes
enough
dark
roasted
malt
character
to
balance
it
out
to
keep
it
from
becoming
sickeningly
sweet
dark
chocolate
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
creamed
coffee
herbal
hops
barely
linger
in
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
definitely
sweet
to
round
out
the
palate
but
its
not
cloying
in
anyway
overall
its
a
12
ounce
offering
from
southern
tier
that
represents
something
different
than
their
mainstream
diabetes
inducing
blackwater
series
which
started
out
amazing
as
a
beer
called
is
that
to
this
day
stands
out
as
an
amazing
imperial
stout
that
theyve
never
recaptured
since
the
first
year
i
tried
that
beer
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
away
from
creme
brulee
choklat
jahva
and
mocha
capping
the
day
off
with
a
new
brew
to
the
area
it
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
cocoa
vanilla
bean
and
the
lightest
possible
touch
of
molasses
everythings
kinda
laid
back
not
wanting
selfexpression
to
get
anywhere
close
to
outofhand
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
darker
roast
some
sweeter
cocoa
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
for
the
sake
of
it
a
touch
more
vanilla
bean
and
a
stronger
though
still
relatively
subdued
vein
of
molasses
right
on
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
little
cream
stout
something
i
could
actually
see
as
a
goto
milk
stout
along
with
left
hand
and
youngs
good
times
definitely
sweet
and
definitely
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
expected
but
terribly
so
chocolate
flavor
mixed
with
a
slight
roast
finishes
fairly
smooth
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
overall
a
solid
stout
but
not
up
to
par
with
southern
tiers
other
bombers
o
not
bad
just
a
slightly
stronger
milk
stout
than
most
lactose
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
not
unpleasantly
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
more
dry
than
expected
with
light
toasted
flavor
and
gentle
cocoa
expression
with
a
mild
caramel
tinge
and
slight
woody
taste
with
light
hop
accent
and
tinge
of
coffee
roastiness
w
a
semisweet
note
as
it
finishes
overall
this
is
a
better
than
average
stout
but
it
loses
me
on
the
2x
concept
i
understand
it
is
bigger
than
most
sweet
stouts
though
it
is
good
for
the
style
but
could
use
more
body
to
be
more
stoutlike
imo
lighter
to
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
a
thin
creamy
feel
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
bad
until
you
get
to
the
finish
i
was
expecting
better
othe
sweetness
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
little
bit
st
usually
hits
the
mark
with
their
stouts
but
this
one
seems
to
have
way
too
much
sugar
o
not
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
sweet
but
not
much
depth
of
flavor
and
the
tobaccoash
really
has
no
place
in
this
style
o
not
quite
as
sweet
as
a
lot
of
stouts
that
ive
had
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
the
southern
tier
creme
brulee
overall
not
bad
would
consider
drinking
again
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
that
ive
had
overall
the
taste
of
the
brew
makes
of
for
some
lacking
in
other
catagories
a
nice
stout
to
try
o
a
really
solid
milk
stout
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
there
are
much
better
beers
made
by
southern
tier
poured
a
dark
brownblack
with
an
offwhite
head
little
retention
and
a
tight
collar
nose
has
some
coffee
grain
dry
and
chalky
dark
chocolate
notes
as
well
taste
has
dark
toasty
grains
bran
light
smoke
coffee
and
some
toastychocolate
notes
medium
mouthfeel
mediumlow
carbonation
a
good
but
not
great
stout
lacks
any
substantial
complexity
or
thickness
in
the
body
left
me
wanting
much
more
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
mocha
colored
head
on
top
there
wasnt
much
lacing
the
retention
wasnt
too
bad
though
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
mellow
roasted
aroma
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
upfront
with
a
solid
bitter
roasted
dark
chocolate
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
in
my
opinion
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
the
most
i
think
i
can
definitely
see
myself
having
this
beer
again
one
day
overallnot
as
sweet
as
id
expect
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
liked
not
what
i
hoped
for
but
still
good
ive
heard
really
good
things
about
this
brewery
so
ill
keep
trying
their
brews
out
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
slight
roast
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
but
nothing
over
the
top
like
some
of
their
other
beers
medium
velvety
mouthfeel
slight
roast
with
a
dark
chocolate
sweetness
almost
has
a
little
smokiness
to
it
as
well
ends
with
a
lingering
bitterness
and
leather
taste
overall
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
them
o
a
solid
milksweet
stout
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
on
draft
but
once
from
the
bottle
is
enough
for
me
notes
overall
a
very
tasty
an
drinkable
beer
start
to
finish
cheers
o
overall
a
good
offering
from
southern
tier
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
if
its
one
that
i
wlll
keep
in
my
regular
rotation
though
overall
id
say
it
is
a
fairly
good
stout
very
drinkable
though
i
usually
prefer
a
stout
with
a
bit
more
character
od
god
the
metallic
taste
wont
leave
my
palate
refuses
to
adjust
to
it
really
surprised
to
dislike
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
i
love
their
2x
ipa
but
this
2x
bothers
me
makes
me
glad
to
have
only
purchased
a
single
i
rarely
rarely
drainpour
but
this
one
is
close
kind
of
a
different
take
on
a
milk
stout
but
not
all
bad
imo
this
could
use
some
more
body
and
less
of
a
grainy
taste
but
drinkable
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
sooner
or
later
pretty
monotone
st
says
2
hops
and
2
malts
and
it
shows
simpler
is
not
always
better
id
like
more
depth
this
is
not
your
typical
milk
stout
heavy
on
the
roast
and
chocolate
and
a
little
lacking
on
the
sweetness
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
think
it
missed
the
style
a
little
too
much
wishing
i
would
have
tried
this
before
buying
a
six
pack
overall
not
bad
but
not
quite
my
style
and
not
great
either
some
ok
flavors
but
some
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
no
real
off
flavors
just
not
very
pleasant
flavors
this
is
a
pretty
solid
milk
stout
the
flavors
mesh
well
and
there
are
enough
hops
to
cut
the
sugary
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
throughout
which
detracts
a
little
bit
from
the
overall
flavor
but
adds
body
so
maybe
it
evens
out
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
nice
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
milk
stout
would
definitely
drink
again
some
things
are
lacking
like
the
aroma
and
appearance
the
taste
is
good
quite
complex
missing
a
little
something
cant
put
my
hands
on
it
otherwise
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
pours
a
pours
a
deep
brownish
black
with
a
1
finger
head
that
thins
to
a
tiny
white
lace
around
the
top
sweet
black
licorice
on
the
nose
with
bitter
bitter
coffee
bean
aroma
toasted
robust
malted
scents
with
a
a
sweet
chocolate
and
toffee
on
the
finish
sweet
chocolates
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
roasted
nut
and
coffee
bean
touch
that
ends
the
sip
on
a
bitter
finish
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
medium
to
full
bodied
bitter
sweet
complex
flavors
all
melding
well
together
at
first
sight
i
was
weary
about
this
beer
but
wow
what
a
taste
this
has
big
nut
and
coffee
elements
to
it
that
just
explode
in
the
mouth
and
a
sweetness
that
only
southern
tier
can
do
right
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
for
sure
o
very
solid
stout
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
try
it
out
moreys
bottom
line
good
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
pretty
tame
and
just
a
little
too
sweet
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
in
a
row
poured
hard
out
of
a
bottle
the
beer
is
dark
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
looking
head
tastes
very
very
smooth
very
evenly
balanced
roasted
flavors
feels
almost
a
little
bit
too
thin
i
really
liked
this
one
really
nice
milk
stout
and
easily
drinkable
has
reallly
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
milk
stout
love
the
nitro
affect
after
you
pour
upside
down
this
brew
was
like
an
imperial
guiness
draught
imo
didnt
care
too
much
for
the
guiness
but
left
hands
was
delicious
very
smooth
and
flavorful
bottle
was
2
50
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
is
hands
down
my
all
time
favorite
bottle
or
tap
its
amazing
on
all
levels
try
this
asap
really
swish
it
around
your
mouth
and
enjoy
every
little
nuance
this
creamy
beer
has
to
offer
this
was
an
absolute
fun
and
delicious
beer
you
have
to
pour
this
beer
aggressively
to
get
the
effect
of
the
nitro
pour
it
worked
really
well
and
looked
like
it
was
poured
from
a
tap
the
volcano
effect
settled
into
a
sweet
smelling
odor
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
the
taste
was
as
smooth
as
silk
it
tasted
like
a
milkshake
at
times
it
was
hard
to
remember
this
was
a
beer
the
smooth
silky
flavors
coat
your
mouth
and
leave
a
nice
feeling
and
leaving
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
sweetness
to
it
i
suggest
pairing
this
with
a
desert
or
after
a
meal
as
a
desert
it
was
really
a
quality
beer
my
beerstout
world
changed
forever
when
i
drank
my
first
left
hand
milk
stout
nitro
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
greatest
stout
on
the
planet
simply
amazing
left
hand
doesnt
distribute
here
in
sioux
falls
yet
so
i
make
state
border
runs
and
stock
up
if
you
love
beer
if
you
like
stouts
this
beer
is
amazing
go
with
the
nitro
soooooooo
smooth
smooth
chocolate
notes
not
highly
carbonated
incredible
was
not
expecting
a
stout
this
good
i
am
usually
harsh
on
stouts
because
most
have
added
carbonation
and
i
personally
feel
that
stouts
are
better
on
their
natural
creamy
froth
like
this
one
a
black
as
coffee
and
not
to
thick
hardly
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
dissipates
to
a
quarter
finger
that
lasts
throughout
with
minimal
lacing
s
definitely
milky
hints
of
mocha
and
chocolate
undertones
of
bread
and
absolutely
no
hint
of
hops
t
milk
and
mocha
are
strong
chocolate
and
bread
come
later
slight
dark
fruit
hops
are
completely
disguised
f
smooth
milky
and
very
little
carbonation
have
to
be
careful
because
of
how
smooth
it
is
it
goes
down
quick
o
superb
stout
definitely
on
my
favorite
list
its
actually
refreshing
pretty
good
stout
tried
the
wake
up
dead
and
had
too
much
alcohols
taste
so
tried
this
one
the
next
night
and
can
taste
a
sweet
chocolate
beer
with
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
feel
smooth
and
full
overall
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
flavor
i
think
this
beer
has
its
time
and
place
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
any
time
soon
i
rarely
invert
a
bottle
of
beer
but
that
is
what
i
was
directed
to
do
thankfully
all
of
the
inverted
glugs
as
a
part
of
the
canquest
tm
left
me
wellversed
in
how
to
pull
this
off
first
the
cascade
as
the
n2
was
driven
off
led
to
the
creation
of
a
finger
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
blackopaque
srm
44
with
cola
highlights
visible
only
at
the
edges
nose
was
very
chocolaty
with
a
touch
of
underlying
smoke
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
creamy
the
taste
was
really
chocolaty
extremely
sweet
especially
for
this
hophead
and
the
combination
put
me
in
mind
of
chocolate
pudding
or
chocolate
mousse
wow
finish
was
likewise
quite
sweet
and
intensely
chocolaty
i
would
definitely
have
this
as
a
dessert
beer
if
i
was
ever
asked
about
a
dessert
beer
out
of
bottle
but
felt
and
tasted
more
like
something
silky
from
the
tap
poured
violently
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
brown
with
tan
foam
and
well
sustained
lacing
smell
very
lightly
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
vanilla
taste
is
sweet
throughout
some
roasted
malts
hint
of
mocha
hint
of
cocoa
barest
hint
of
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
pretty
light
with
no
signficant
carbonation
noted
overall
great
representative
of
the
milk
stout
genre
easy
drinking
pleasant
not
particularly
complex
but
quite
enjoyable
smooth
drinking
need
one
now
this
is
an
amazing
stout
and
the
standard
for
the
style
in
my
book
its
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
few
beers
i
could
see
myself
crushing
a
6pack
of
in
one
sitting
like
guinness
draught
in
terms
of
drinkability
but
a
lot
more
flavor
im
not
a
stout
veteran
and
havent
had
too
many
but
this
was
really
good
smells
of
chocolate
real
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
chocolate
little
coffee
and
bitter
up
front
and
and
a
little
sweet
twards
the
end
excellent
i
recommend
you
do
the
hard
pour
that
they
recommend
you
do
stout
or
pint
glass
crack
the
bottle
and
turn
it
completely
upside
down
and
let
it
pour
violently
into
glass
result
was
creamy
milkshake
head
that
lasted
the
whole
time
would
recommend
had
on
tap
done
really
well
to
style
really
delicious
beer
would
recommend
if
you
ever
see
on
draft
i
love
stouts
but
this
one
fell
short
no
head
was
present
upon
pouring
the
taste
was
smooth
but
unremarkable
o
beautiful
looking
beer
with
really
nice
aromas
and
flavors
overall
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
its
really
thinbodied
unlike
most
souts
thickness
and
heaping
flavor
are
two
of
the
main
reasons
i
love
stouts
and
this
beer
had
neither
what
little
taste
was
there
was
pretty
good
it
just
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfil
alcohol
well
hidden
would
like
more
bite
actually
would
like
a
little
more
on
the
nose
and
maybe
some
coffee
other
than
that
well
done
nothing
special
regular
cream
stout
nothing
bad
to
say
about
though
good
taste
bit
of
sweetness
expected
more
froth
is
all
otherwise
pretty
tasty
like
this
one
about
the
same
as
the
normal
milk
stout
would
drink
again
cool
concept
having
nitro
filled
bottles
the
pour
was
beautiful
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
entire
beer
typical
for
any
beer
on
a
nitro
tap
however
this
came
from
a
bottle
and
is
really
impressive
like
most
nitro
beers
the
nose
is
non
existent
and
all
flavors
are
muted
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
nitro
beers
are
sucked
of
all
of
their
smell
and
taste
and
this
one
isnt
much
of
an
exception
ill
take
the
regular
version
any
day
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
wasnt
what
i
came
to
expect
in
a
stout
more
like
milk
as
in
the
name
overall
a
very
impressive
milk
stout
great
flavor
great
finish
not
sure
why
but
i
think
im
the
only
one
who
is
really
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
just
far
too
thin
for
me
to
get
past
tastes
just
fine
with
some
good
roasty
chocolate
notes
but
the
mouthfeel
here
kind
of
ruins
the
beer
for
me
sorry
left
hand
maybe
to
harsh
im
just
not
a
stout
fan
not
bad
tastes
like
a
guiness
with
flavor
paid
11
49
for
a
6
pack
really
not
worth
it
at
all
id
much
rather
buy
a
riverhorse
milk
stout
for
that
price
this
was
my
least
favorite
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
a
good
beer
spoilt
imho
by
a
thoroughly
unnatural
method
that
makes
an
amazing
looking
beer
but
a
dodgy
consistency
negative
impact
on
flavours
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
hands
down
first
time
ive
done
4s
across
the
board
but
all
are
well
deserved
did
pour
hard
the
2nd
time
to
get
a
slight
light
brown
head
and
release
the
wonderful
aromas
held
within
a
very
mellow
and
flavorful
taste
throughout
will
come
back
to
this
one
i
was
really
disappointed
after
reading
all
the
enthusiastic
reviews
maybe
i
just
dont
like
this
style
the
smell
is
not
a
good
start
for
me
really
does
remind
me
of
milk
mixed
with
beer
that
sweet
milky
lactose
taste
really
jumps
out
at
meand
not
in
a
good
way
feel
is
thin
and
almost
flat
a
bit
more
carbonation
might
help
balance
the
sweetness
if
you
enjoy
imperial
stouts
you
may
not
like
this
great
beer
perfectly
balanced
with
the
taste
of
chocolate
great
look
great
flavors
not
too
sweet
cocoa
and
coffee
bitterness
comes
through
terrific
mouthfeel
as
close
to
nitro
tap
as
one
can
get
in
a
bottle
great
with
desserts
seafoods
burgers
or
on
its
own
very
light
stout
aroma
coffeedark
choc
milk
still
a
large
degree
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
out
of
this
world
very
smooth
but
the
light
carbonation
is
playful
and
sits
on
the
tongue
appearance
is
also
a
highlight
w
the
nitrogen
providing
a
tight
white
head
that
stays
throughout
wow
very
easy
to
drink
drinks
like
a
chocolate
milk
but
much
thiner
smells
of
cocoa
so
smooth
this
is
a
must
if
you
enjoy
syouts
o
solid
stout
very
creamy
and
smooth
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
very
true
to
the
style
this
would
make
a
fantastic
stout
float
overall
its
good
but
i
think
the
flavor
sort
of
takes
a
hit
as
compared
to
the
non
nitro
version
of
this
dark
somewhat
heavy
but
sweet
not
much
carbonation
so
its
somewhat
flat
but
enjoyable
solid
beer
taste
is
lacking
though
got
lucky
enough
to
live
down
the
street
that
carries
this
and
sells
6
packs
to
go
until
3am
oh
man
what
a
treat
so
delicious
dark
but
not
too
heavy
with
a
dark
chocolate
coffee
malt
aftertaste
coming
in
at
a
very
drinkable
6
ill
be
buying
more
so
good
it
never
made
it
to
a
glass
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
milk
chocolate
roasted
malts
earth
and
charcoal
the
taste
is
sweet
milk
chocolate
almost
like
a
chocolate
milk
shake
some
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
smoke
earthy
notes
finishes
with
mor
of
the
roasted
malts
and
milk
chocolate
velvety
slick
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
overall
very
well
done
i
still
prefer
the
draft
but
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
again
glad
it
is
now
available
in
ct
best
beer
ever
made
hands
down
sweet
very
little
carbonation
nice
feel
very
smooth
not
as
burnt
as
i
would
have
expected
based
on
the
color
good
session
stout
nice
finish
with
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
very
pleasant
to
drink
on
a
chilly
evening
wonderfully
smooth
and
a
beautiful
pour
when
poured
hard
the
way
the
brewer
recommends
easily
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
smooth
yet
complex
full
bodied
flavor
one
of
the
best
stouts
on
the
market
the
nitro
adds
a
nicer
creamier
texture
than
the
originalconventional
left
hand
milk
stout
however
it
loses
some
of
more
pronounced
bitter
from
the
original
sweet
well
balanced
in
flavor
and
texture
a
stout
almost
too
easy
to
drink
im
loving
it
the
pour
was
beautiful
with
a
solid
black
body
with
a
khaki
head
slowly
rising
from
the
brew
was
very
inviting
the
smell
was
a
bit
subtle
but
i
did
pick
up
on
some
chocolate
notes
and
some
roasted
scents
the
taste
and
feel
were
awesome
with
semisweet
chocolate
came
through
in
a
deliciously
creamy
stout
thought
it
was
awesome
smooth
and
sweet
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
smooth
stout
with
great
color
but
lacking
somewhat
in
flavor
and
scent
probably
one
of
my
favorites
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
nitro
super
creamy
make
for
a
great
dessert
beer
pretty
solid
milk
stout
and
the
nitro
makes
it
even
better
love
this
stout
its
delicious
it
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
go
to
restaurants
and
buy
it
from
the
store
fantastic
beer
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
roast
that
isnt
too
bitter
not
too
heavy
goes
down
easy
could
drink
this
all
day
heard
it
was
real
good
but
got
to
try
it
and
was
very
disappointed
very
smooth
lots
of
roast
with
heavy
coffee
and
mocha
flavor
big
milk
finish
just
delicious

reveals
cascades
of
beautiful
purging
nitrogen
from

eventually
grows
to
two

it

roasted

is

as
it
enters

but
the
agitation
of
the
nitrogen
creates
the
illusion
of
a
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
stout
i
could
session
this
all
day
long
at
6
abv
taste
is
like
the
smell
but
more
pronounced
roasted
malts
chocolate
milk
then
light
coffee
beanslight
hop
bitterness
lingers
for
a
little
while
overall
im
very
impressed
and
i
like
the
nitro
milk
stout
better
than
left
hands
regular
milk
stout
because
its
so
pretty
to
look
at
and
it
tastes
creamier
yet
less
filling
great
drink
ability
no
bad
after
taste
similar
to
guinness
but
with
more
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
milk
stout
great
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
some
subtle
coffee
accented
with
some
nice
caramel
brown
sugar
and
vanillalike
sweetness
all
wrapped
up
in
an
extremely
smooth
quaff
ill
certainly
be
getting
more
of
this
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
there
is
some
hints
of
darkness
i
gatherd
some
flavor
butnothing
stuck
out
or
over
powerd
some
light
earthyness
and
very
mild
coffee
its
a
well
balanced
beer
far
feel
to
taste
ratio
could
easily
drink
this
again
update
marking
this
one
down
a
little
it
doesnt
live
up
to
my
memory
and
the
sweetness
stands
out
more
than
it
used
to
also
while
the
nitro
is
very
smooth
it
doesnt
seem
to
provide
adequate
bubbles
for
the
right
mouthfeel
it
just
seems
kind
of
flat
still
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
stout
though
had
this
from
tap
at
brown
iron
brewery
and
it
was
pretty
good
liked
the
nitro
version
pretty
sweet
overall
not
much
else
v
a
little
pricy
locally
10
dollars
a
six
pack
but
worth
trying
will
be
a
repeat
stout
for
me
o
one
of
the
most
milksweetness
forward
milk
stouts
ive
had
its
nothing
crazy
but
is
delicious
and
has
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
real
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
roasty
bitterness
in
here
definite
recommend
overall
any
interesting
first
impression
with
milk
stouts
id
much
rather
have
a
fbs
or
other
dark
chocolate
stouts
but
this
milk
stout
leans
towards
a
session
beer
i
could
enjoy
of
a
few
of
in
one
setting
one
of
my
favorites
chocolate
is
very
subtle
yet
there
great
beer
a
must
taste
one
of
the
smoothest
stouts
around
good
aroma
and
coffee
taste
overall
it
was
a
pleasant
drink
nothing
special
but
not
one
to
count
out
id
definitely
pick
it
up
as
a
party
beer
for
me
draft
poured
dark
coffee
black
with
3
fingers
of
lingering
head
significant
lacing
throughout
the
drink
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
little
to
no
sugar
smell
taste
is
like
a
more
fill
bodied
guinness
not
sweet
not
boozy
no
overpowering
coffee
taste
too
light
in
the
mouth
and
taste
for
me
very
light
abv
so
you
can
drink
a
few
not
a
lot
of
taste
actually
i
was
disappointed
but
i
prefer
boozy
bourbon
barrel
aged
russian
imperial
stout
this
is
too
light
for
me
might
be
your
cup
of
tea
though
i
used
a
vigorous
pour
as
the
bottle
instructed
strong
coffeelike
aroma
and
flavor
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
cracked
open
with
a
fizz
but
no
real
head
even
poured
it
straight
down
the
center
of
the
glass
smell
is
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
goes
a
bit
wrong
for
me
i
know
its
only
a
6
abv
beer
but
i
was
expecting
just
a
bit
more
because
its
a
milksweet
stout
taste
is
pretty
typical
for
a
milk
stout
but
nothing
too
special
much
like
the
nose
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
but
it
again
left
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
light
sweetness
for
style
the
taste
just
isnt
there
tastes
watered
down
great
stout
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
on
the
finish
but
none
the
less
i
would
definitely
drink
again
serving
type
bottle
overall
outstanding
beer
one
of
the
best
domestic
beers
in
this
style
im
a
fan
forever
i
dont
like
the
new
scoring
system
i
rate
for
my
memory
not
so
much
for
others
since
i
am
such
a
rookie
at
this
this
was
very
good
indeed
was
not
impressed
at
all
nice
and
dark
almost
black
with
a
slight
brown
around
edge
1
finger
creamy
tan
head
after
a
very
vigorous
pour
into
a
pint
stout
glass
little
to
no
lace
smells
are
good
with
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
little
mocha
but
it
falls
short
on
flavor
and
mouth
feel
flavors
are
good
but
mild
too
subtle
to
rate
as
an
exceptional
stout
a
little
chocolate
very
little
coffee
no
roast
no
hops
little
malt
sweetness
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
good
but
they
are
not
assertive
enough
for
my
taste
mouth
feel
is
watery
for
a
milk
stout
very
thin
light
to
medium
body
frothy
foam
is
correct
for
milk
but
this
is
more
like
skim
milk
than
a
chocolate
milk
shake
so
although
i
thought
it
was
ok
it
just
wasnt
anything
special
mouthfeel
nitro
carbonation
does
wonders
for
mouthfeel
incredibly
smooth
and
silky
fairly
dry
in
the
aftertaste
delicious
creamy
amazing
pours
black
low
carbonation
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
typical
stout
flavors
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
low
hop
bitterness
i
really
liked
this
beer
in
fact
i
like
it
quite
a
lot
and
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
would
have
rated
a
4
75
if
it
had
a
decent
head
this
is
a
great
creamy
delicious
stout
perfect
drink
for
the
winter
ill
definitely
purchase
it
again
overall
my
goto
stout
i
wish
bars
everywhere
across
america
carried
this
stout
as
their
nitro
tap
versus
guinness
a
truly
magnificent
crafted
stout
thanks
left
hand
overall
an
excellent
beer
made
even
better
with
the
nitro
carbonation
o
very
good
for
a
milk
stout
but
not
amazing
think
i
prefer
the
co2
version
better
still
the
mouthfeel
cascade
effect
was
pretty
cool
beautiful
cascade
smells
and
taste
good
coffee
malty
sweetness
mouth
feel
is
very
good
this
has
the
nitro
feel
with
a
heavy
oatmeal
stoutlike
creamy
body
and
it
is
unique
and
pleasant
very
good
stuff
overall
a
pretty
awesome
beer
but
its
dangerous
at
even
a
low
6
abv
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
im
not
as
big
a
fan
of
this
it
seems
a
little
to
chalky
to
me
great
looking
beer
with
decent
aroma
but
as
i
drank
it
i
really
didnt
follow
what
other
reviews
have
been
saying
the
flavors
seem
muted
and
left
an
unappetizing
aftertaste
that
i
just
didnt
like
the
body
was
too
smoothed
out
i
like
a
soft
smooth
mouth
feel
but
this
just
didnt
seem
right
to
me
just
not
for
me
i
guess
overall
a
fantastic
milk
stout
and
worth
getting
i
recently
reviewed
a
gose
the
other
day
it
was
my
first
time
trying
that
style
and
i
was
simply
turned
off
by
the
salty
and
sour
taste
even
if
im
not
crazy
about
a
beer
i
will
almost
always
finish
it
in
this
rare
case
i
had
to
dump
it
i
thought
that
perhaps
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
dumped
a
beer
then
i
recalled
that
i
had
once
ordered
this
milk
sout
months
ago
at
a
beer
i
am
belatedly
reviewing
this
beer
as
i
recall
the
only
other
time
i
was
unable
to
finish
one
the
milky
taste
and
low
carbonation
was
too
much
of
a
turn
off
not
for
me
overall
a
fun
beer
and
even
one
of
the
better
regular
milk
stouts
that
ive
had
for
a
style
i
dont
really
care
for
too
often
make
sure
you
pour
this
aggressively
nice
black
color
and
retains
a
very
nice
creamy
off
white
head
laces
all
the
way
down
to
the
last
drop
with
bit
of
creamy
head
still
left
at
the
bottom
smooth
and
creamy
taste
with
hints
of
mocha
coffee
and
a
hint
of
toasted
nuttiness
one
of
my
favorites
from
left
hand
and
the
nitro
makes
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
look
almost
like
glitter
when
the
glass
is
tilted
you
know
maybe
i
am
the
only
one
who
thinks
this
but
i
am
a
sucker
for
the
original
and
dont
think
the
nitro
format
even
on
tap
adds
anything
in
this
particular
instance
its
great
beer
of
course
the
original
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
or
at
least
into
dark
beers
and
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
it
the
nitro
seems
to
detract
from
rather
than
add
to
the
richness
it
sounds
weird
but
the
viscosity
and
low
carbonation
of
the
original
is
more
appealing
to
me
than
the
thinner
but
more
alive
nitro
version
the
flavors
are
great
but
the
sweetness
which
i
love
about
it
is
balanced
out
a
little
more
here
which
ordinarily
i
would
love
but
here
less
so
the
nitro
version
has
some
advantages
though
i
think
it
makes
a
better
morning
drink
in
fact
one
of
the
best
the
roasty
notes
come
out
more
in
the
absence
of
sweetness
a
great
coffee
substitute
one
of
the
only
beers
this
is
true
for
but
i
like
the
original
better
than
the
nitro
although
the
nitro
bottling
technology
is
cool
overall
really
fitting
of
the
label
dessert
beer
if
it
had
a
tad
less
sweetness
id
be
more
compelled
to
keep
it
in
stock
however
as
it
is
its
pretty
top
notch
my
rating
is
for
the
draft
version
mmmm
nitro
i
just
love
everything
about
this
beer
the
pour
the
rich
flavor
the
smooth
feel
the
nitro
cascade
everythign
and
its
6
0
which
is
fabulous
i
dont
really
want
my
favorite
to
be
a
9
8
or
a
10
its
just
too
much
sometimes
this
is
all
around
delish
so
smooth
and
flavorful
its
unreal
currently
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
only
reason
i
didnt
rate
it
a
5
is
i
am
assuming
someday
i
will
find
a
beer
i
like
more
standard
stout
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
is
a
rich
creamy
milky
beer
that
is
a
little
unusual
upon
first
taste
smells
like
a
stout
tastes
like
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
where
it
gets
weird
but
good
weird
this
is
not
in
any
way
a
complex
beer
but
i
honestly
feel
like
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
is
simple
yet
highly
enjoyable
and
i
would
drink
it
again
so
is
this
a
nitrogenated
beer
simply
bottled
it
seems
to
be
and
it
really
brings
out
the
character
of
the
beer
ive
had
the
left
hand
milk
stout
in
the
regular
version
before
but
this
really
blows
me
away
it
made
me
think
of
mackesons
xxx
which
for
me
was
the
original
as
well
as
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
milk
stouts
and
then
it
lived
up
to
that
and
perhaps
even
surpassed
it
in
a
way
as
its
so
clean
and
focused
is
there
a
little
more
character
to
the
mackesons
or
is
it
just
the
nitro
thats
making
me
think
the
left
hand
is
more
homogenized
regardless
i
am
crazy
in
love
with
this
beer
even
for
people
who
dont
really
like
dark
beer
this
is
an
absolute
musttry
overall
the
mouthfeel
ruins
a
perfectly
good
beer
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
overall
impressions
i
love
this
beer
and
i
cant
think
of
a
better
sweet
stout
to
cater
to
my
hormonal
wonkiness
once
a
month
than
this
chocolate
beauty
shes
a
perfect
ten
in
my
book
or
at
least
a
perfect
eightpointfive
velvety
rich
taste
smooth
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
overall
4

the
hype
is
justified
with
this
beer
as
its
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
had
the
flavors
are
light
yet
balanced
with
roasted
malts
chocolate
lactose
and
oats
this
is
like
an
edmund
fitzgerald
with
lactose
thrown
in
its
so
damn
creamy
i
dont
even
feel
it
going
down
this
is
what
i
wished
guinness
could
be
a
perfect
go
to
or
for
someone
new
to
stouts
i
regularly
indulge
in
riss
and
still
find
this
great
a
world
class
beer
without
a
doubt
and
recommend
this
highly
smooth
black
milky
goodness
notes
of
chocolate
and
mocha
pour
it
hard
and
watch
the
show
o
an
outstanding
milk
stout
now
i
see
what
its
so
highly
touted
wish
i
had
bought
more
ill
seek
this
one
again
for
sure
pours
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
hint
of
coffee
it
tastes
like
rich
creamy
chocolate
with
some
coffee
and
roasted
notes
delicious
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
thick
one
of
the
creamiest
mouthfeels
ive
ever
experienced
i
only
purchased
a
single
and
hope
to
drink
more
in
the
future
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
o
would
recommend
for
oyster
stout
lovers
but
this
taste
nothing
like
a
milk
stout
decent
buzz
for
6
overall
think
of
this
as
an
intense
guinness
can
pour
it
takes
that
style
of
beer
to
another
level
and
the
fact
this
is
a
sweet
stout
makes
it
all
that
more
interesting
to
me
i
think
this
is
the
style
i
have
really
been
looking
for
its
not
too
brutal
like
an
imperial
stout
but
its
not
to
thin
like
a
guinness
or
a
porter
can
be
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
it
will
be
a
winter
staple
love
this
one
a
tasty
milk
stout
the
nitro
treatment
giving
it
ever
more
dessertquality
silkiness
no
hint
of
the
elevated
abv
and
a
pleasure
to
put
back
as
it
seems
like
winter
is
approaching
the
mile
high
city
sooner
than
expected
hide
your
pumpkins
overall
drinkability
ive
always
been
concerned
that
a
nitrobottle
cant
quite
pull
off
a
nitro
tap
or
a
nitrocan
type
of
mouthfeel
but
this
one
comes
quite
close
great
looking
beer
and
one
that
definitely
promotes
the
chocolate
milk
type
of
effect
in
a
beer
but
still
having
the
bitter
finish
of
a
stout
and
you
know
its
a
beer
went
very
well
with
dark
chocolate
chip
wheat
muffins
and
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
other
desserts
ill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
again
someday
my
fav
for
any
time
yummy
for
everyone
that
complains
about
no
head
you
have
to
pour
this
beer
straight
upside
down
into
your
glass
check
their
website
it
shows
how
to
pour
a
nitro
beer
overall
delicious
unique
rendition
of
a
stout
that
feels
less
like
steak
and
potatoes
and
more
like
chocolate
mousse
in
your
stomach
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
and
ctreamy
very
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
trying
this
if
you
get
the
chance
as
i
took
my
first
sip
the
head
felt
like
little
pillows
cushioning
my
lips
as
i
drank
the
nectar
of
the
gods
this
is
truly
an
outstanding
beer
if
you
poor
it
correctly
as
described
on
bottle
the
beer
creates
three
layers
the
colors
and
layers
remind
me
of
a
latte
the
taste
also
similar
to
coffee
strong
mocha
hints
with
maybe
some
sweet
chocolate
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
or
drink
just
one
for
dessert
to
quench
any
sweet
tooth
cravings
winner
left
hand
figured
out
how
to
bottle
this
without
messing
up
the
nitro
and
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
it
tastes
completely
different
than
the
regular
milk
stout
and
i
like
this
one
even
better
this
is
a
huge
achievement
for
nitro
beers
for
all
those
who
are
skeptical
of
nitro
beers
in
the
bottle
this
is
your
proof
that
it
can
be
done
and
it
can
be
done
to
near
perfection
thick
smooth
tasty
nitro
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
wednesday
night
something
you
can
drink
with
ease
and
confidence
im
sure
you
can
get
a
hold
of
something
better
for
friday
though
overall
a
solid
stout
but
slightly
underwhelming
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
very
complex
flavors
milk
and
chocolate
very
very
creamy
not
no
be
missed
if
you
have
the
chance
to
enjoy
so
smooth
and
drinkable
not
to
mention
a
pure
joy
to
watch
the
head
form
after
a
hard
poor
the
only
way
it
could
be
better
is
if
the
flavor
was
a
bit
stronger
creamy
enjoyable
stout
recommended
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
an
extremely
smooth
drinkable
body
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
consistent
throughout
making
for
a
sustained
pleasurable
experience
a
better
cascade
pour
than
guinness
take
the
extra
second
to
pour
it
right
and
get
rewarded
inky

isnt
particularly
strong
but
lots
of
dark

coffee
with
lots

sugar
sweet
and
roasty
taste
and
feel
are
equally
highly
ranked
smooth
sweeter
and
roasty
with
almost
zero
detectable
hops
so
velvety
smooth
and
with
enough
body
really
really
good
beer
this
is
probably
a
new
standard
for
the
style
a
perfect
example
of
how
american
beers
are
the
best
in
the
world
my
favorite
beer
of
the
year
o
as
far
as
chocolatecoffee
type
beers
go
it
just
doesnt
get
all
that
much
better
than
this
im
sure
that
there
is
better
out
there
but
virtually
all
of
it
is
going
to
set
you
back
quite
a
bit
further
financially
compared
to
left
hand
brewings
offering
at
roughly
ten
bucks
a

do
yourself
a

light

medium

slightly

touch
of
chocolate
remember
coming
home
after
a
day
of
school
and
pouring
a
big
glass
of
chocolate
milk
refreshing
right
this
beer
is
like
that
a
blackdeep
brown
pour
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
i
remember
just
how
taken
i
was
with
the
lacing
the
first
time
each
sip
is
measured
for
posterity
along
the
glass
down
to
the
last
gulp
chocolate
and
something
like
a
warm
pumpernickel
rye
greet
the
nose
the
even
smoothness
of
the
creamy
stout
gives
way
to
an
initial
subtle
sweet
latte
flavor
settling
into
a
dark
chocolate
finish
i
cannot
remember
which
of
my
many
preferred
stouts
was
my
favorite
prior
to
my
first
lhmsn
my
next
favorite
will
need
to
be
pretty
immaculate
to
force
me
away
from
this
dairy
queen
i
think
you
could
drink
this
with
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
but
on
its
own
this
is
a
great
after
schoolwork
snack
its
no
dragons
milk
but
its
a
fine
beer
you
get
a
mocha
taste
at
first
but
finishes
with
an
oak
taste
reeealy
smooth
nice
and
dark
can
drink
this
everytime
smooth
coffee
tasting
deliciousness
dark
stout
creamy
and
goes
down
smooth
really
like
this
although
i
need
another
round
to
practice
the
hard
pour
into
the
glass
im
sure
this
is
why
my
head
was
a
bit
on
the
low
end
of
the
scale
easily
one
of
my
3
favorite
beers
left
hand
brewery
has
it
going
on
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
122114
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
coffee
i
think
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
roasted
malt
milkbittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
really
creamy
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
little
bit
better
than
their
original
milk
stout
because
of
the
improved
mouthfeel
on
this
its
a
good
brew
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
2
19
for
a
single
bottle
as
black
as
midnight
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
addition
of
lactose
combined
with
the
nitro
gas
gives
it
a
smooth
finish
if
you
know
anybody
that
loves
guinness
but
is
not
into
craft
beer
give
them
one
of
these
and
see
if
they
enjoy
it
o
fantastic
beer
great
for
an
evening
or
dessert
beer
wow
the
head
and
n
this
is
soft
fluffy
and
tenacious
roaaty
but
easy
drinking
very
smooth
can
your
brewery
bottle
a
nitro
milk
stout
and
ship
it
half
way
across
america
didnt
think
so
and
thats
why
this
beer
gets
a
five
without
taking
a
stance
on
whether
the
beer
is
best
with
standard
carbonation
or
this
new
nitroinfused
version
the
nitrogen
gives
the
beer
a
tighter
weave
making
the
beer
look
and
feel
more
dense
but
the
beer
is
also
slightly
less
aromatic
and
thinner
if
not
drank
quickly
i
honestly
enjoyed
this
version
very
well
chocolatey
delicious
with
a
balanced
amount
of
hops
o
6
which
is
interestingly
slightly
above
the
abv
of
the
original
lh
milk
stout
when
i
reviewed
it
back
then
it
clocked
in
at
5
2
but
the
alcohol
remains
firmly
in
check
making
this
a
pleasant
experience
my
knock
against
the
original
lh
milk
stout
was
that
i
felt
it
was
lacking
in
creaminess
and
body
compared
to
other
milk
stouts
but
the
nitro
offering
resolves
those
gripes
quite
favorably
nicely
done
rjt
appearance
i
love
the
dark
black
color
of
this
beer
one
of
the
darkest
colors
i
have
seen
even
for
a
stout
probably
just
me
not
pouring
it
hard
enough
into
the
glass
but
there
was
little
to
no
head
which
i
found
disappointing
smell
wonderful
notes
of
milk
and
mochaespresso
tastemouthfeel
exceptional
i
personally
love
milk
stouts
and
this
reminded
me
of
my
alltime
favorite
beer
odell
lugene
very
smooth
taste
with
strong
coffee
notes
in
general
the
taste
is
lacking
a
bit
for
me
i
found
myself
wanting
more
flavor
than
i
got
the
aftertaste
is
quite
pleasant
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
with
no
problem
occasionally
i
taste
a
sharp
alcohol
note
usually
upon
the
initial
sip
but
it
disappears
quickly
overall
a
wonderful
milk
stout
that
i
will
purchase
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
im
so
glad
i
was
able
to
find
it
this
weekend
planning
on
drinking
this
one
many
more
times
final
grade
4
07
a
solid
a
left
hand
has
produced
an
exceptionally
highquality
milk
stout
here
its
a
little
too
saccharine
to
be
something
id
consume
on
a
regular
basis
but
to
be
fair
this
is
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
to
begin
with
its
still
a
tasty
little
beer
that
is
well
worth
a
try
if
youre
curious
although
i
doubt
its
very
popular
amongst
the
diabetic
demographic
o
very
good
flavors
are
a
bit
challenging
to
find
other
than
the
lactose
but
they
are
there
very
good
feel
in
the
mouth
seems
to
cover
every
square
inch
of
the
mouth
which
results
in
a
nice
creamy
finish
not
dry
at
all
good
overall
beer
my
go
to
stout
if
there
is
nothing
else
that
strikes
my
fancy
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
standard
pint
glass
after
a
two
course
campground
meal
this
is
a
nearly
black
stout
with
almost
zero
head
and
minimal
lace
theres
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
taste
is
nice
sweet
smooth
malt
with
tons
of
coffee
flavor
and
some
chocolate
just
a
hint
of
roast
but
nothing
brisk
or
sharp
at
all
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
chocolate
milklike
texture
this
is
overall
a
good
after
dinner
dessert
beer
that
would
also
stand
up
fairly
well
on
its
own
overall
a
nice
balance
and
went
well
with
something
sweet
to
eat
ellen
liked
it
too
pours
a
pitch
black
coffee
with
almost
no
carbonation
best
date
was
july
2014
tastes
like
a
typical
milk
stout
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
threw
me
off
to
the
point
that
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
because
i
love
milk
stouts
compared
to
lugenes
the
taste
is
similiar
but
lugenes
has
more
body
and
flavor
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
o
there
is
nothing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
thus
far
in
my
drinking
exploits
excellent
as
a
fan
of
porter
and
stout
beer
i
stumbled
across
this
a
few
months
ago
and
im
glad
i
did
has
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
guinness
this
will
blow
your
mind
the
nitro
truly
does
improve
overall
texture
and
mouthfeel
left
hand
does
make
carbonated
milk
stout
which
is
good
but
doesnt
compare
to
their
nitro
version
highly
recommend

decent
bitterness
evens
things
out
hops
seem
earthy
woodsy
although
mostly
nonexistent
feels
silky
smooth
from
nitro
like
a
milkshake
great
feel
medium
full
to
full
overall
a
very
well
crafted
beer
nitro
makes
it
extra
so
special
o
not
much
to
say
its
just
that
good
will
have
again
and
again
and
again
anyways
i
like
it
and
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
this
is
a
good
value
stout
very
drinkable
ps
i
gave
the
regular
lhms
a
4
14
last
june
so
the
age
on
this
certainly
did
not
hurt
it
any
price
point
2
5012
oz
single
o
satisfies
the
nitro
craving
with
a
great
silky
smooth
feel
pretty
good
roasted
malt
flavor
overall
i
never
thought
a
bottled
beer
could
ever
replicate
the
experience
of
nitro
beer
on
tap
this
well
its
not
every
day
im
jonesing
for
a
nitro
stout
but
its
heartening
to
know
i
dont
even
need
to
hit
up
the
pub
anymore
if
the
craving
hits
me
highly
recommended
even
if
for
the
novelty
alone
overall
this
is
a
perfect
substitute
for
guinness
draught
you
know
for
when
you
desire
something
better
this
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
even
if
the
taste
is
definitely
on
the
light
side
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
nitro
presentation
of
this
beer
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
carbonated
version
kudos
to
be
able
to
present
a
beer
on
nitro
without
a
cylinder
poured
a
gorgeous
deep
black
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
abundant
lacing
nice
nitro
cascade
and
bubbles
throughout
very
good
looking
stout
scents
of
milk
chocolate
roast
malt
cocoa
and
slight
black
coffee
a
very
nice
aroma
quite
chocolateforward
and
sweet
but
with
the
darker
stout
aromas
present
as
well
very
nice
flavor
begins
with
sweet
milk
chocolate
mingled
with
roast
malt
and
bittersweet
cocoa
flavors
moving
into
a
more
pronounced
hit
of
roast
malt
with
some
cream
and
black
coffee
finish
is
dry
with
flavors
of
bittersweet
cocoa
roast
malt
and
cream
aftertaste
is
bitter
roast
malt
and
cocoa
powder
a
very
nice
flavor
rich
and
creamy
with
big
hits
of
chocolate
yet
balanced
by
roasted
and
bitter
flavors
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
modest
prickly
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
its
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
finding
a
nice
balance
inbetween
it
has
a
rich
aroma
and
great
mouthfeel
that
aid
its
very
good
flavor
profile
very
well
done
o
a
welcome
option
i
am
likely
to
pick
up
again
in
the
future
like
some
of
the
better
porters
this
offers
a
good
combination
of
drinkability
with
smooth
roasted
goodness
as
a
stout
id
like
a
bit
more
lusciousness
but
this
beer
is
a
nice
counterbalance
to
the
cellar
of
12
abv
imperials
that
i
like
to
keep
o
nice
stout
overall
id
like
a
second
chance
at
pouring
it
correctly
overall
very
tasty
and
with
the
new
nitro
bottles
i
could
picture
myself
buying
more
of
this
stuff
if
readily
available
overall
very
good
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
stout
lovers
regular
go
to
beer
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
it
is
incredibly
smooth
with
a
high
quality
head
what
i
think
sets
this
beer
apart
from
other
milk
stouts
is
its
mouthfeel
and
taste
im
also
a
fan
of
the
rich
smell
giving
you
the
perfect
introduction
to
the
wonderful
taste
of
the
beer
the
beer
is
alright
would
like
the
nitro
to
be
a
little
more
robust
the
overall
taste
is
very
sweet
and
tastes
of
strong
cream
coffee
chocolate
oats
and
barely
i
do
not
taste
any
hops
in
this
stout
its
not
a
particularly
thick
stout
but
it
is
sweet
and
the
taste
is
very
good
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
would
compliment
desert
very
nicely
i
get
the
impression
that
cherries
or
anything
with
cherries
cherry
pie
cheesecake
or
cordials
would
compliment
this
stout
very
nicely
o
b
d91
delicious
and
great
aroma
must
have
beer
should
be
on
your
want
list
phenomenal
flavors
nice
body
delicious
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
nearly
cried
tears
of
joy
simply
the
best
milk
stout
ive
had
to
date
it
had
the
smoothest
feel
and
the
taste
was
incredible
i
prefer
this
version
to
their
nitro
version
which
is
also
a
good
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
milk
stouts
and
want
one
that
will
rock
your
socks
off
this
is
a
stout
that
you
must
try
simply
amazing
the
only
thing
better
is
the
same
thing
in
nitro
left
hand
milk
stout
nitro
is
the
greatest
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
nuff
said
one
of
my
favorites
great
taste
smooth
as
silk
nice
complex
flavors
and
not
overly
burnt
malty
milky
not
too
sweet
a
solid
but
unspectacular
brew
would
definitely
buy
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
pours
with
a
small
light
brown
head
is
black
in
color
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
is
in
abundance
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
initial
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
milk
hops
finish
the
taste
with
the
roasted
malts
continuing
until
the
end
a
truly
amazing
beer
thee
milk
stout
if
you
ask
me
this
is
my
all
time
fave
the
beer
that
made
me
open
up
to
a
new
world
of
beers
will
always
love
this
one
absolutely
superb
milk
stout
by
left
hand
rich
balanced
and
creamy
with
malt
and
cocoa
notes
a
very
mildly
sweet
finish
heavy
bodied
with
some
moderate
lacing
virtually
no
foam
which
is
about
my
only
disappointment
extremely
drinkable
on
tap
at
the
whiskey
room
in
burlington
vt
best
craft
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
blows
duck
rabbit
out
of
the
water
on
tap
at
mellow
mushroom
i
love
this
stuff
and
cant
get
enough
of
it
im
lucky
enough
to
know
someone
who
works
at
left
hand
and
have
been
to
the
brewery
to
sample
all
of
their
beers
but
the
milk
stout
is
by
far
my
favorite
while
i
hoping
to
get
more
out
of
this
for
a
stout
it
is
a
solid
beer
it
is
a
very
average
beer
it
isnt
bad
it
just
isnt
that
memorable
either
this
beer
was
very
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
other
left
hand
stout
this
one
was
a
little
bitter
not
my
style
of
beer
but
good
espresso
notes
finished
clean
and
lingered
on
the
pallet
nice
not
bad
but
not
my
style
kind
of
watery
compared
to
other
stouts
smell
and
look
is
very
similar
to
most
stouts
out
there
on
the
market
tastes
sweeter
than
most
stouts
but
i
kinda
wish
it
wasnt
as
watery
i
feel
if
it
was
a
tad
bit
thicker
the
sweetness
would
have
worked
better
the
nitro
version
is
far
far
better
but
this
is
pretty
good
too
was
everything
i
look
for
in
a
beer
thought
the
smell
didnt
do
it
justice
but
i
dont
like
beer
because
of
the
way
it
smells
perfect
for
my
tastes
will
definitely
bug
them
to
get
it
to
wv
simply
dark
and
delicious
american
stout
poured
hard
as
usually
instructed
by
left
hand
milk
stouts
to
a
two
finger
dark
tan
head
color
is
a
deep
black
with
decent
lacing
the
taste
of
coffee
and
malt
were
through
out
the
low
carbonation
and
sweet
lactose
made
for
a
really
smooth
feel
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
but
not
as
good
as
their
milk
stout
nitro
nitro
bottle
this
thing
could
not
be
smoother
black
pour
with
thin
creamy
brown
top
aromas
of
so
much
roasted
flavor
is
quite
sweet
delicious
just
a
delicious
somewhat
sweet
beer
very
good
nitro
is
better
creamy
rush
of
flavor
milk
and
vanilla
but
lack
of
nose
and
disappearing
finish
was
disappointing
great
beer
just
held
my
hopes
a
little
to
high
much
nicer
as
it
warms
up
i
tried
it
from
the
bottle
after
a
long
cold
ride
home
flavors
did
not
present
themselves
till
it
warmed
up
after
pouring
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
very
dark
as
it
should
but
with
a
thin
head
and
light
lacing
syrupy
but
a
bit
on
thin
side
for
the
mouth
feel
with
very
light
carbonation
strong
on
sugar
and
light
malt
scent
and
flavor
but
not
enough
notes
present
on
the
tongue
to
make
it
really
interesting
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
needs
a
little
more
complexity
to
balance
it
out
overall
an
excellent
brew
to
introduce
novices
who
are
afraid
of
the
dark
die
hard
stout
vets
may
find
it
wanting
a
bit
definitely
better
as
it
warms
though
little
bit
sweeterless
burnt
flavor
than
a
guiness
though
it
has
a
creamy
taste
it
didnt
have
the
creamy
head
like
a
guiness
that
kinda
bummed
me
out
perhaps
i
shouldve
poured
it
harder
into
the
glass
im
curious
as
to
the
difference
with
the
nitro
version
anyhow
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
the
cap
says
pour
hard
i
dont
know
what
that
means
there
was
maybe
a
quarter
inch
of
creamy
foam
and
it
was
dark
as
expected
the
taste
was
well
balanced
but
just
generally
not
very
intense
they
call
it
americas
stout
on
the
label
i
guess
this
is
probably
as
good
as
it
gets
as
far
as
making
a
stout
with
wide
appeal
except
guinness
on
tap
however
i
think
the
idea
of
a
stout
that
appeals
to
everyone
runs
the
risk
of
removing
the
characteristics
that
make
it
stout
and
i
think
this
goes
a
bit
too
far
in
that
direction
probably
their
best
beer
overall
great
taste
look
smell
etc
highly
recommended
o
great
beer
will
buy
again
this
is
my
favorite
stout
to
get
on
draft
the
head
isnt
as
cream
colored
or
thick
when
poured
from
a
bottle
got
better
and
sweet
towards
the
end
good
beer
will
drink
again
great
taste
color
and
feel
o
you
wont
be
disappointed
great
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
milk
stouts
overall
admittedly
i
had
a
large
number
of
preconceptions
about
this
given
all
the
good
things
that
id
heard
about
it
to
be
sure
its
a
mighty
fine
example
of
a
sweet
stout
and
a
cut
above
many
of
those
found
in
the
uk
and
ireland
im
given
to
understand
that
the
nitro
version
is
better
so
that
may
be
one
to
track
down
definitely
in
my
top
ten
stouts
though
a
much
sweeter
version
of
guinness
i
mean
much
sweeter
i
prefer
guinness
but
this
is
good
stuff
yummy
balanced
tasty
dark
goes
nicely
with
steak
and
ale
pie
or
loaded
baked
potato
light
carboantion
and
sweet
aftertaste
a
great
beer
smoothest
dark
beer
ive
had
quick
review
from
a
hophead
from
tap
after
a
taste
from
wifes
had
to
get
a
pint
quality
beer
very
similar
in
look
feel
and
taste
to
guinness
review
is
outside
after
a
spicy
meal
good
look
nice
foam
retained
throughout
mouth
feel
was
nice
and
smooth
if
you
got
a
little
foam
but
was
a
little
thin
wo
overall
taste
was
of
a
good
dark
stout
coffee
apparent
with
a
smoky
ambience
but
def
not
as
strong
and
robust
as
some
others
i
can
see
how
others
really
like
this
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
esp
at
the
start
it
just
leveled
off
after
but
overall
well
worth
a
try
or
a
6
this
one
has
a
nice
dense
dark
look
as
it
should
the
aroma
coming
off
of
the
top
is
a
little
like
overripe
fruit
and
toffee
with
coffee
notes
the
flavor
is
equal
to
the
aroma
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
much
better
i
think
as
it
gets
warmer
fairly
good
head
retention
my
favorite
beer
at
the
moment
wonderful
flavor
mouth
feel
and
aroma
this
one
is
a
keeper
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
the
great
look
flavor
and
such
a
full
taste
my
favorite
beer
ive
ever
tried
a
quality
stout
refreshing
but
falls
short
compared
to
all
the
rushian
imperial
stouts
i
have
lying
around
while
definitely
a
good
stout
i
find
the
nitro
variant
to
be
much
more
appealing
in
all
sectors
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
love
the
look
just
not
the
taste
this
is
my
favorite
of
all
of
the
nitros
i
love
the
name
and
the
beer
is
just
as
good
absolutely
great
great
balanced
flavor
smooth
and
a
light
stout
option
very
watery
unexpectedly
sweet
not
a
favorite
thick
smooth
smoky
aftertaste
almost
like
youve
smoked
a
decent
cigar
american
craft
beers
on
the
1001
beers
list
are
nothing
if
not
consistent
this
one
is
another
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
very
good
balance
to
it
it
wasnt
quite
as
sweet
as
your
normal
milk
stout
and
the
alcohol
content
was
a
little
higher
than
usual
but
so
to
was
the
standard
the
beer
was
great
drinking
from
the
start
and
a
beer
well
worth
its
place
on
the
list
my
favorite
beer
as
of
yet
hint
of
coffee
beans
in
taste
smooth
and
light
mocha
dry
finish
extremely
smooth
taste
i
love
the
full
body
as
well
notes
of
coffee
and
a
very
creamy
finish
smooth
creamy
taste
very
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
bold
coffee
and
milky
notes
love
this
brew
my
fall
back
favorite
i
absolutely
love
this
brew
even
better
on
nitro
left
hand
milk
stout
brewed
by
left
hand
brewing
company
with
an
abv
of
6
0
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
light
brown
head
it
has
the
look
of
coffee
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
malts
not
much
to
note
on
the
smell
of
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
it
is
smooth
but
rich
with
flavor
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
you
pick
up
on
malts
and
a
mild
sweetness
it
the
taste
of
this
brew
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
no
bad
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
bold
but
clean
finish
left
hand
milk
stout
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
overall
im
giving
left
hand
milk
stout
a
4
out
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
a
solid
ballpeen
smack
of
subtle
nutty
creamy
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
solid
ok
i
admit
it
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
this
is
a
tasty
sweet
stout
not
much
head
on
my
pour
but
rich
and
thick
silky
smooth
mouth
feel
roasted
coffee
chocolate
but
not
a
burnt
taste
or
astringent
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
use
this
as
an
introduction
to
the
dark
side
for
non
stout
lovers
if
you
want
sweet
rich
and
roasted
this
is
it
taste
like
a
guinness
but
maybe
a
bit
more
chocolateymilky
tasting
havent
been
disappointed
by
left
had
either
another
good
brew
smooth
dark
sweet
stout
drank
youngs
english
double
chocolate
stout
for
3
winters
until
i
ran
into
this
beautiful
with
or
without
company
overall
i
think
this
just
better
than
the
nitro
version
a
more
hearty
feel
about
it
better
then
the
nitro
version
imo
short
and
sweet
its
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
out
there
balanced
full
flavor
and
nice
body
pour
hard
it
says
on
the
cap
yes
do
it
forms
a
head
with
beautiful
carbonation
just
like
a
draft
or
can
nitro
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
creamy
flavor
and
no
discernable
bitterness
love
the
milk
stout
in
the
bottle
but
not
so
much
on
draft
i
find
the
draft
has
more
of
a
coffee
taste
perfection
simply
put
the
first
milk
sweet
stout
ive
ever
had
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
cool
concept
behind
this
beer
this
is
a
stout
for
those
who
have
a
sweet
tooth
malty
notes
of
roasted
barley
oats
and
chocolate
i
believe
the
brewers
at
left
hand
say
it
best
milk
sugar
in
your
stout
is
like
cream
in
your
coffee
because
of
the
sweetness
i
found
this
was
a
beer
i
could
drink
over
a
long
night
but
you
definitely
need
to
be
i
an
a
specific
mood
to
drink
this
beer
my
preference
is
more
of
a
straight
forward
stout
i
would
drink
this
again
it
just
might
not
be
my
first
choice
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
coming
along
a
little
stale
due
to
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
begins
with
earthy
malts
along
with
toffee
and
molasse
as
well
as
a
salted
whiff
adding
an
interesting
twist
to
the
beer
roasted
qualities
are
standing
out
in
this
brew
enhanced
by
cream
and
gentle
milk
chocolate
turns
sweeter
during
the
finish
revealing
a
little
heat
caramel
and
syrup
with
a
coffeeish
bitter
impact
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
balancing
the
beer
this
beer
is
a
5
when
on
draft
in
my
earlier
years
i
drank
so
much
of
this
that
i
cannot
now
so
you
go
go
get
some
now
very
dark
with
subtle
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
there
are
smoother
creamier
stouts
than
this
though
i
found
it
to
be
a
much
sharper
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
one
of
my
favorites
ive
got
it
on
nitro
at
home
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
velvety
finish
no
bitterness
feel
very
smooth
medium
body
well
carbonated
pours
dark
and
impenetrable
full
2
g
fingers
of
head
from
draft
smell
grains
and
sugar
coffee
chocolate
very
light
in
the
mouth
not
heavy
definitely
a
light
abv
reminds
me
of
guinness
lighter
hints
of
cream
in
the
mouth
subtle
chocolate
and
coffee
going
down
no
bitterness
very
drinkable
wont
face
plant
you
smooth
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
founders
breakfast
im
not
as
fired
up
about
it
as
others
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
try
and
keep
on
hand
at
all
times
absolutely
delicious
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
not
only
is
it
smooth
it
has
a
full
body
taste
that
fills
your
mouth
with
a
soft
finish
it
also
fun
to
pour
it
hard
just
turn
the
bottle
over
and
let
it
fall
go
to
their
site
and
watch
the
video
o
its
like
the
taste
of
guinness
times
3
and
better
because
of
the
creamy
taste
this
is
a
big
step
up
from
lhs
nitro
milk
stout
the
label
is
awesome
i
wish
i
had
a
poster
of
it
good
but
not
as
much
as
its
nitro
cousin
try
this
and
then
try
the
milk
stout
nitro
and
be
pleasantly
surprised
rating
a
this
is
dubbed
as
americas
great
milk
stout
and
its
easy
to
see
why
excellent
flavor
slightly
sweet
and
without
the
bitterness
of
many
stouts
6
alcohol
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
a
good
one
to
have
in
the
fridge
once
it
gets
cold
this
ones
worth
the
hype
dark
appearance
watery
taste
not
what
i
expected
from
a
stout
easily
my
favourite
stout
first
tried
in
nyc
on
a
hot
day
hit
the
spot
very
drinkable

a
very
dark
very
creamy
very
good
very
dark
not
as
creamy
looking
as
guinness
smells
kind
of
like
a
normal
irish
stout
very
creamy
mouth
feel
some
coffee
flavor
lots
of
caramel
taste
similar
to
guinness
but
better
this
this
is
the
first
one
of
this
style
beer
that
i
have
ever
liked
i
was
amazed
on
tasting
how
appealing
it
was
especially
as
a
dessert
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
rich
thick
smooth
and
so
creamy
this
beer
is
great
on
its
own
or
when
paired
with
other
beers
like
raspberry
lambic
a
white
stout
or
even
something
more
exotic
like
wells
banana
bread
creamy
mouth
feel
from
the
nitrogen
tasting
notes
include
milk
chocolate
black
coffee
brown
sugar
and
toffee
this
is
a
top
notch
milk
stout
that
the
nitro
makes
even
better
this
will
be
my
first
review
bear
with
me
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
smell
of
this
stout
it
smell
of
a
milky
creamy
sensation
the
feel
of
the
beer
overall
was
creamy
and
delightful
but
the
taste
was
a
let
down
compared
to
the
smell
yet
id
enjoy
this
beer
again
but
its
not
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
good
stout
nice
black
color
decent
head
the
creaminess
is
awesome
the
aroma
at
first
was
amazing
and
the
taste
was
also
great
although
not
up
to
par
with
what
i
expected
after
the
smell
overall
a
creamy
enjoyable
stout
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
round
it
all
off
m
creamy
smooth
slightly
below
average
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
will
definitely
buy
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
tastes
in
a
few
months
smoother
than
the
guiness
or
other
stouts
i
am
sure
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
drink
it
slow
to
enjoy
the
flavor
it
does
not
hit
you
over
the
head
subtle
and
complex
glass
shaker
pint
pours
a
near
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
never
quite
vanishes
and
leaves
some
sticky
lace
down
the
glass
smells
like
chocolate
vanilla
little
dark
fruit
and
coffee
taste
is
mostly
bittersweet
chocolate
and
dark
malts
nice
clean
crisp
finish
tho
not
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
smooth
medium
to
full
body
coats
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
nice
bite
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
good
stuff
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
its
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
as
instructed
by
the
bottle
label
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
very
quickly
and
let
the
nitro
do
what
it
was
designed
to
do
a
thick
microfoam
head
formed
on
top
of
a
brownnearblack
body
the
nose
is
all
dry
stout
and
oats
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
surprisingly
light
lush
caramel
and
oats
finishing
with
a
crisp
dry
stout
cleanness
just
lovely
poured
on
tap
the
color
was
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
coffee
head
that
settled
and
left
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
nice
with
hints
of
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
lot
of
malt
the
taste
had
a
lot
more
chocolate
than
the
nose
implied
and
i
thought
it
was
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
my
favorite
part
not
overly
thick
but
still
coated
the
mouth
and
throat
very
well
i
really
liked
this
one
and
thought
it
would
be
great
in
the
fall
but
even
in
the
summer
it
was
a
nice
treat
recently
had
this
on
tap
on
a
trip
to
colorado
it
was
phenomenal
the
pour
was
awesome
with
a
rich
brown
head
and
great
lacing
all
the
way
through
look
was
dark
as
night
the
smell
was
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
chocolatey
but
real
subtle
with
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
and
cream
the
mouth
feel
was
smooth
as
silk
i
would
definitely
drink
this
anytime
overall
a
very
good
stout
i
find
i
chug
this
one
down
faster
than
most
beers
i
do
go
back
and
forth
a
bit
about
this
one
sometimes
it
just
seems
a
bit
plain
othertimes
its
the
best
thing
since
sliced
bread
never
pass
one
up
though
maybe
its
the
fact
we
pulled
through
this
tornado
touchdown
and
im
happy
to
be
breathing
and
indulging
but
i
felt
that
not
only
was
this
an
amazing
stout
it
was
an
amazing
drinking
experience
overall
i
will
be
revisiting
nitro
again
if
i
can
find
it
in
indiana
my
favorite
beer
out
there
right
now
this
stout
sets
the
standard
for
all
other
stouts
a
fine
dark
color
and
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
milk
sets
up
a
smooth
and
think
taste
that
we
all
expect
from
our
stouts
the
chocolate
flavors
leave
a
pleasant
aftertaste
that
keeps
you
coming
back
o
id
try
this
again
on
tap
but
this
beer
reiterates
to
me
that
its
hard
to
go
back
once
youve
gone
imperial
this
might
be
a
nice
step
on
the
ladder
if
you
seek
to
climb
upwards
from
guinness
serving
type
nitrobottle
agree
with
the
guy
below
saying
its
a
good
crowd
option
and
sessionable
had
hoped
for
more
from
the
nitro
fill
pours
black
no
head
smells
nice
sweet
lactose
coffee
beans
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
coffee
tiny
bit
of
cocoa
feel
isnt
anything
special
which
was
a
disappointment
almost
tastes
a
bit
flat
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
im
not
a
beer
connoisseur
i
love
dark
beers
like
guinness
before
trying
guinness
in
college
i
never
liked
beer
still
trying
to
broaden
my
horizons
i
selected
this
beer
after
reading
the
reviews
on
this
site
and
i
was
quite
impressed
dark
chocolate
rich
in
flavor
delicious
i
have
added
this
to
my
favorites
list
to
buy
again
ive
had
the
nitro
version
of
this
beer
which
i
thought
was
unbeatable
but
theres
still
something
deeply
satisfying
about
this
original
version
great
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
would
get
this
beer
again
would
consider
it
for
a
barbecue
option
o
here
it
is
now
that
left
hand
comes
to
md
i
think
ive
found
the
perfect
guinness
substitute
for
st
patricks
day
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
make
that
the
perfect
guinness
substitute
365
days
a
year
this
is
delicious
good
beer
imagine
guinness
or
murphys
with
a
little
sugar
added
and
you
have
this
beer
personally
im
not
a
fan
sweets
this
beers
sweetness
is
mild
but
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
liking
if
guinness
is
black
coffee
this
is
a
latte
great
for
those
who
like
the
texture
of
nitro
beers
without
the
roasted
flavor
odbought
a
single
glad
i
didnt
go
for
a
full
sixer
it
was
a
cool
beer
to
pour
and
the
flavors
were
pretty
on
point
however
the
carbonation
was
very
flat
still
happy
i
tried
this
o
creamy
and
enjoyable
this
milk
stout
is
my
first
beer
from
left
hand
the
nitrobottle
is
something
new
to
me
so
i
found
that
interesting
i
will
look
for
more
from
left
hand
in
the
future
o
its
an
ok
stout
im
really
not
that
impressed
with
it
o
this
takes
me
back
to
my
early
days
as
a
guinness
drinker
but
much
better
the
roasted
maltiness
is
great
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
nice
wish
i
could
pick
up
a
little
more
on
the
nose
overall
a
well
executed
nitro
stout
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
hit
several
of
these
back
to
back
the
lactose
in
this
milk
stout
played
strongly
in
the
foreground
providing
so
smooth
a
mouthfeel
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
accidentally
gulp
and
finish
this
thing
from
the
start
ubersmooth
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
a
typical
soft
mildly
spiced
milk
stout
that
was
again
so
creamy
i
just
couldnt
put
it
down
this
has
absolutely
become
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
poured
into
a
glass
tulip
dark
almost
black
typical
of
this
type
of
beer
fairly
aggressive
pour
doesnt
immediately
yield
a
big
frothy
head
but
seems
to
build
after
its
in
the
glass
nice
tan
foam
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
with
chocolate
and
coffee
overtones
taste
is
a
little
sweet
without
being
syrupy
all
in
all
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
tasted
a
little
better
than
expected
above
average
and
recommendable
cheers
o
one
of
my
first
with
this
style
very
drinkable
and
super
creamy
on
the
palate
sweet
but
not
overly
i
thought
several
times
to
myself
that
this
was
like
grown
up
chocolate
milk
would
seek
this
out
again
as
a
change
up
to
bigger
beers
from
time
to
time
o
this
is
a
delicious
milk
stout
the
lactose
doesnt
drag
down
the
rich
malt
flavors
of
stouts
but
adds
a
nice
undertone
to
it
pours
pitch
black
in
color
that
you
cant
see
through
a
small
beige
head
at
first
is
seen
then
fades
to
just
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
decent
lacing
is
seen
which
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
black
coffee
very
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
at
first
that
slowly
fades
into
a
very
sight
bitter
finish
but
perfect
actually
perfect
carbonation
also
goes
down
easy
and
very
smooth
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
actually
o
extremely
enjoyable
desert
beer
you
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
the
kind
of
beer
you
find
yourself
idly
thinking
i
could
really
do
with
a
milk
stout
right
now
at
odd
times
pretty
unusual
very
tasty
overall
a
damn
tasty
milk
stout
pretty
roasty
compared
to
many
others
ive
had
nice
brew
one
of
the
best
stouts
from
colorado
and
a
treat
to
be
proud
of
the
nitro
bottle
is
pure
beer
innovation
and
changes
their
base
milk
stout
into
a
whole
new
beer
delicious
beautiful
and
so
so
smooth
overall
im
a
sucker
for
stouts
on
nitro
and
milk
stouts
are
the
perfect
beer
to
be
served
this
way
this
is
a
very
good
creamy
chocolaty
beer
it
goes
down
extremely
easily
and
had
i
not
been
driving
i
probably
would
have
had
a
few
more
this
one
pours
a
liquid
smooth
tan
with
a
huge
white
head
looks
delicious
not
getting
a
whole
lot
from
the
nose
on
this
one
milky
little
espresso
some
raisins
notes
as
well
this
is
definitely
a
desert
beer
wow
is
this
one
sweet
to
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
like
drinking
liquid
gold
incredibly
creamy
and
desirable
not
something
you
can
session
or
have
a
lot
of
but
a
very
good
sipper
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
top
5
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
seeking
a
delicious
stout
and
has
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
o
being
my
first
milk
stout
i
might
find
better
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
often
go
back
to
o
would
not
buy
again
im
more
of
thick
stout
kind
of
guy
this
one
just
wasnt
to
my
likings
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
stout
its
not
as
full
bodied
or
overly
flowing
with
coffee
and
cocoa
aromas
as
traditional
stouts
this
beer
is
however
medium
bodied
the
coffee
aroma
is
more
subtle
but
the
flavor
is
very
good
is
silky
smooth
and
just
lingers
on
the
tongue
like
milk
a
very
drinkable
must
try
o
an
excellent
beer
for
anyone
who
enjoys
milk
or
beer
just
seeing
the
nitro
gush
foam
into
my
glass
was
worth
the
price
the
only
real
negative
point
would
be
the
slight
souring
on
the
backend
but
this
was
a
very
minor
component
of
the
flavor
profile
a
drinkable
stout
not
too
heavy
not
too
bitter
creamy
and
flavorful
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
the
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
left
some
nice
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
roasty
and
it
hints
toward
a
strong
roast
flavor
that
does
not
pan
out
as
the
flavor
profile
has
only
a
mild
roastiness
to
it
the
flavor
profile
is
tilted
more
toward
the
sweet
end
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
milky
this
is
a
fine
and
enjoyable
offering
o
a
decent
drinker
of
a
stout
the
nitro
certainly
adds
a
great
deal
to
smooth
out
the
mouthfeel
and
give
this
one
a
bit
of
a
silky
feel
to
the
beer
that
said
i
just
wish
there
was
more
to
the
beer
itself
as
it
is
overly
simple
and
unexciting
upon
my
arrival
home
i
immediately
found
a
pint
glass
i
poured
hard
as
directed
and
found
that
a
heavy
head
of
beer
formed
nicely
i
noted
the
dark
almost
blackish
color
and
the
creamy
dark
head
on
the
pint
glass
not
much
carbination
but
little
bubbles
moving
in
the
glass
the
aroma
had
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
first
sip
was
smooth
to
the
palate
and
had
a
great
initial
taste
but
a
far
better
after
taste
the
beer
was
very
good
overall
this
stout
just
fell
short
for
my
liking
i
prefer
slightly
sweeter
milk
stouts
this
was
too
bitter
they
got
the
milky
texture
right
they
just
need
to
work
on
balancing
this
one
out
this
could
have
just
been
a
bad
bottle
but
it
struck
me
as
nothing
more
than
a
slightly
above
average
stout
ogreat
milk
stout
havent
had
the
non
nitro
in
five
years
since
moving
away
this
was
great
to
have
especially
in
nitro
but
have
to
travel
to
va
for
o
its
good
but
nothing
mind
blowing
all
the
flavors
in
here
are
nice
and
nothing
is
harsh
or
overpowering
i
really
like
the
lactose
sweetness
also
i
swear
i
taste
something
like
weed
in
here
but
i
think
im
just
imagining
that
overall
a
great
widely
available
every
day
drinking
milk
stout
certainly
give
it
a
shot
and
nitro
as
well
good
beer
cool
that
you
can
get
a
nitro
beer
in
bottles
at
such
a
great
price
i
pick
it
up
from
time
to
time
especially
in
the
colder
months
overall
i
prolly
have
a
bad
batch
its
not
supposed
to
taste
sour
is
it
all
i
get
is
jackfruit
like
taste
i
dont
taste
the
dark
chocolate
sweet
black
coffee
like
other
people
have
been
saying
a
stout
that
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
it
describes
perfectly
the
word
milk
stout
very
assertive
milky
and
not
complex
it
could
be
a
dessert
for
the
entire
family
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
left
hand
milk
stout
i
love
bitter
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
this
very
creamy
milk
stout
was
perfect
for
my
liking
this
evening
as
others
have
said
not
much
of
a
head
but
i
was
not
at
all
unhappy
as
the
taste
made
up
for
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
it
was
too
cold
i
was
not
impressed
with
what
i
saw
nooo
head
at
all
and
i
was
like
crap
however
the
beer
smelled
okay
and
i
was
really
surprised
when
i
tasted
it
the
beer
had
a
really
smooth
feel
and
taste
it
was
quite
good
and
i
mean
i
t
tasted
like
a
stout
any
stout
really
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
i
actually
had
the
nitro
version
beautiful
dark
stout
probably
around
40
on
the
srm
scale
i
must
have
not
have
given
it
a
hard
enough
pour
because
the
head
was
weak
aroma
was
like
a
mocha
coffee
nice
taste
included
the
expected
sweet
malty
flavor
cocoa
and
left
little
bitter
notes
on
the
aftertaste
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
oats
it
offered
low
carbonation
viscosity
was
medthick
a
fairly
delicious
beer
that
i
would
give
another
shot
and
recommend
to
all
nitro
or
not
left
hands
milk
stout
has
been
a
goto
for
me
since
i
first
tried
it
at
6
the
flavor
profile
is
robust
enough
but
not
overpowering
if
only
this
were
as
widely
available
on
tap
as
guinness
draught
o
would
not
drink
again
would
not
recommend
dont
understand
why
it
is
so
high
maybe
ill
try
another
bottle
in
awhile
minor
faults
taste
and
mouthfeel
sweet
and
delicious
roasted
malts
mix
well
with
chocolate
and
vanilla
notes
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
i
cant
say
that
i
am
very
enthused
about
the
style
as
i
dont
really
care
for
the
milk
taste
its
drinks
like
its
a
diluted
stout
the
head
never
fell
overall
purchased
on
a
blind
buy
really
glad
i
did
i
would
have
preferred
if
they
let
the
reigns
of
subtlety
go
just
a
bit
but
overall
its
a
delicious
offering
that
while
light
is
still
creamy
and
flavorful
not
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
a
well
balanced
milk
stout
o
a
nice
milk
stout
with
just
the
right
amount
of
lactose
sweetness
it
balances
the
roastiness
of
the
malts
and
coffee
very
well
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
dessert
beer
o
i
still
cant
really
get
past
the
burnt
coffee
flavors
but
the
sweetness
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
must
make
this
quite
a
nice
treat
for
those
who
enjoy
them
purchased
as
part
of
a
mixsix
no
full
sixer
in
my
future
did
not
care
too
much
for
the
smell
but
the
taste
and
texture
is
nearly
perfect
i
am
just
starting
to
get
into
stouts
porters
and
craft
beers
because
guinness
is
my
favorite
beer
or
was
until
i
had
this
this
blows
guinness
out
of
the
water
i
am
in
love
with
how
easily
this
beer
goes
down
while
still
having
an
amazing
texture
and
taste
my
first
beer
ive
had
by
left
hand
brewing
company
and
i
defiantly
will
be
trying
others
o
this
is
a
splendid
beer
with
all
the
right
subtle
complexities
enjoy
after
dinner
overall
damn
good
brew
buy
it
and
try
it
very
pleased
i
bought
this
beer
now
if
we
could
just
increase
the
supply
of
this
beer
to
get
the
price
down
im
tired
of
dropping
12sixer
for
it
but
i
will
most
certainly
continue
keeping
it
in
the
fridge
pours
near
pitch
black
with
an
ample
offwhite
head
that
slowly
falls
leaving
some
quite
a
bit
of
splotchy
lace
and
a
thin
but
solid
layer
of
bubbles
smells
wonderful
milk
chocolate
coffee
a
bit
a
lactic
sourness
milky
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
dry
at
first
but
with
a
milk
chocolate
luxuriousness
coffee
and
cream
sweetness
melds
with
milk
chocolate
oh
my
such
a
luxurious
stout
so
good
what
a
wonderful
stout
smooth
nice
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
not
a
flat
stout
it
has
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
nice
finish
this
stout
is
better
than
the
nitro
that
is
offered
by
left
hand
nitro
is
ok
and
a
must
try
but
it
is
not
as
smooth
and
does
not
finish
like
the
milk
stout
both
are
very
good
but
i
prefer
the
milk
overall
simply
incredible
5000
thread
count
egyptian
cotton
sheets
have
nothing
on
the
soft
smooth
body
this
beer
exhibits
light
enough
to
enough
multiple
in
one
sitting
however
i
highly
recommend
savoring
this
one
if
you
come
across
it
bravo
left
hand
excellent
stuff
but
i
pity
i
could
only
obtain
a
bottle
this
old
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
better
yet
in
the
nitro
bottles
that
theyve
been
distributing
the
lactic
sugars
even
at
this
point
provide
a
stout
that
is
less
on
the
sweet
chocolate
syrupy
side
and
far
more
on
actual
fresh
chocolate
which
is
pretty
much
unimaginable
without
its
vanilla
sweet
counterpart
i
would
gladly
have
more
overall
draft
magazine
called
this
americas
best
stout
at
one
point
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
stout
lover
or
anyone
who
is
looking
for
something
different
in
my
opinion
draft
magazine
was
right
this
stout
is
better
than
most
imports
and
other
american
crafts
pick
it
up
if
you
are
able
this
is
like
a
sessional
stout
always
a
go
to
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
a
great
exemplar
of
the
style
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
it
looks
very
nice
in
the
glass
although
the
head
zipped
away
pretty
quick
a
very
deep
brown
color
promises
depth
and
substance
the
nose
is
surprisingly
unstoutlike
and
reflects
more
sweet
than
malt
notes
the
taste
is
very
robust
with
nice
chocolate
roasty
tones
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
the
word
milk
in
front
of
it
but
the
lactose
adds
a
nice
creaminess
to
the
beer
without
distracting
from
the
rest
of
the
flavors
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
out
on
draft
if
you
are
a
stout
fan
i
highly
recommend
this
one
this
beer
is
simply
fantastic
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
this
is
your
beer
the
coffee
and
chocolate
really
come
through
in
both
taste
and
smell
i
will
say
if
you
really
want
the
sweetness
to
come
through
drink
the
beer
a
little
warmer
than
fridge
temps
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
sweetness
came
through
i
found
this
extremely
easy
to
dink
and
overall
enjoyed
it
very
much
ive
had
the
regular
milk
stout
in
the
past
but
this
nitro
version
was
better
and
easier
to
drink
i
could
session
this
like
a
guinness
and
think
that
this
may
be
easier
to
drink
and
better
tasting
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
at
a
good
price
point
o
awesome
awesome
beer
and
not
even
a
rarity
or
a
specialoccasiononly
due
to
its
price
delicious
milkshakelike
in
body
and
widely
available
this
is
now
my
goto
winter
beer
spend
the
extra
buck
for
the
nitrobottled
version
this
is
a
very
popular
beer
in
my
area
and
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
it
came
in
a
nitro
bottle
and
was
served
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
appeared
to
be
pitch
black
but
others
will
argue
it
is
just
very
dark
brown
the
head
recedes
to
a
sliver
and
holds
the
beer
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
molasses
smelling
more
bitter
than
sweet
the
taste
is
bittersweet
starting
sweet
but
finishing
with
the
coffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
but
finishes
flat
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
and
increased
carbonation
may
have
benefited
the
beer
in
this
area
although
a
thicker
and
creamier
mouthfeel
should
be
expected
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
good
flavors
that
just
didnt
match
all
that
well
for
me
its
easy
to
find
this
beer
at
least
the
nonnitro
version
but
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
with
a
small
off
white
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
nice
strong
aroma
tastes
of
coffee
with
slight
chocolate
aftertaste
slight
milky
taste
beer
is
medium
bodied
that
has
a
creamy
feel
and
goes
down
nicely
overall
a
very
good
beer
will
definfitely
buy
again
an
outstanding
milk
stout
pours
nice
and
dark
with
a
good
brown
creamy
head
the
head
didnt
last
though
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
so
creamy
and
smooth
nice
and
sweet
the
smells
come
though
on
the
palate
chocolate
is
was
i
tasted
the
most
of
with
a
nice
hint
of
coffee
this
milk
stout
is
a
must
have
creamy
mouthfeel
as
it
should
be
a
delicious
beer
i
always
said
that
odells
cutthroat
porter
could
use
a
full
body
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
the
same
roasty
notes
with
an
added
bonus
of
being
sweet
and
silky
smooth
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
the
smell
is
so
inviting
that
you
cant
help
but
down
the
entire
bottle
in
no
time
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
and
eminently
pleasant
brew
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
liven
things
up
and
the
taste
isnt
anything
that
will
blow
your
pants
off
regardless
this
will
become
a
permanent
resident
in
my
fridge
left
hand
milk
stout
nitro
45
d
ridiculously
good
this
a
world
class
example
of
the
milk
sweet
stout
category
i
dont
buy
many
cases
in
a
year
but
this
one
is
definitely
case
worthy
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
exceptional
and
im
not
afraid
to
say
world
class
a
few
minor
tweaks
to
enhance
appearance
and
taste
and
this
one
would
be
one
of
the
best
beers
going
my
best
experience
with
left
hand
by
a
mile
and
more
note
rereviewing
due
to
change
in
serving
format
from
nitrobottle
to
nitrotap
makes
a
world
of
difference
o
flavorwise
it
could
pop
a
bit
more
but
this
is
an
insanely
drinkable
smooth
stout
a
shame
i
hadnt
hit
this
up
sooner
im
not
usually
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
but
when
i
am
i
tend
to
prefer
one
that
is
not
too
bitter
this
beer
is
fantastic
im
hard
pressed
to
say
anything
i
dislike
about
it
but
i
dont
want
to
give
it
all
fives
just
in
case
i
find
one
i
like
better
for
the
moment
this
is
my
favorite
kind
of
stout
the
texture
is
slightly
creamy
and
makes
me
think
of
dark
chocolate
i
guess
the
one
thing
i
would
like
to
see
on
this
beer
is
a
longerlasting
head
well
see
what
i
think
of
the
nitro
version
of
this
guy
soon
just
bought
both
in
a
make
your
own
sixpack
i
quite
liked
this
one
but
i
understand
if
not
everyone
appreciates
it
very
hot
texas
weather
overall
lacks
liveliness
to
the
point
of
being
boring
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
6
abv
isnt
noticeable
good
stout
overall
quite
possibly
my
new
favorite
beer
only
other
brew
i
can
compare
it
to
for
sheer
awesomeness
of
the
taste
is
guinness
foreign
extra
although
they
really
dont
taste
alike
got
this
as
a
single
and
will
be
heading
back
for
a
pack
overall
its
plenty
good
enough
if
youre
wanting
a
milk
stout
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
id
definitely
pick
up
a
sixpack
and
then
another
it
sure
hits
the
spot
without
being
too
sweet
but
i
do
think
it
needs
a
little
refiningsome
more
body
a
bit
more
roast
and
perhaps
some
more
fruit
would
do
the
trick
overall
my
first
experience
with
a
milk
stout
as
opposed
to
regular
stout
beers
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
and
look
forward
to
many
more
while
it
is
smooth
enough
to
go
down
easily
it
is
enjoyable
enough
to
want
to
savor
i
think
that
i
would
order
this
over
a
guinness
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
milky
flavour
is
much
more
pronounced
than
other
milksweet
stout
that
ive
had
and
it
works
pretty
well
overall
yummy
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
left
hand
brews
and
sweet
stouts
highly
recommend
this
beer
food
pairingwhat
we
actually
ate
it
with
we
enjoyed
with
hamburgers
on
ciabatta
buns
it
complimented
the
beef
so
a
more
thoughtful
pairing
might
included
your
choice
of
red
meat
overall
definitely
a
pleasant
drink
could
picture
myself
drinking
many
more
of
this
it
looks
great
smell
is
welcoming
and
tastes
amazing
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
for
sure
opretty
solid
milk
stout
and
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
trying
the
nitro
stout
overall
pretty
solid
stout
i
thought
the
flavors
were
a
little
underwhelming
but
then
again
i
havent
had
a
normal
strength
stout
in
awhile
i
would
definitely
recommend
its
not
an
overbearing
taste
good
drinkable
stout
summary
pretty
great
sweet
easy
to
drink
chocolate
malt
melteddown
no
carbonation
this
and
lakewoods
temptress
are
my
favorite
milk
stouts
overall
a
solid
beer
for
sure
it
tastes
like
it
has
high
quality
ingredients
and
pours
very
nicely
id
buy
a
bunch
of
this
to
have
on
hand
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
a
great
deal
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
a
wellmade
milk
stout
indeed
very
thick
and
creamy
taste
but
not
too
much
almost
a
bitter
taste
but
yet
very
sweet
and
enjoyable
definitely
a
winter
type
stout
thats
good
for
the
snowed
in
folk
i
tried
this
out
of
a
6
pack
in
whidbey
island
wa
from
the
beer
works
highly
recommend
trying
this
stout
if
your
a
fan
of
thicker
beers
definitely
one
to
try
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
if
not
my
favorite
beers
ive
had
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
way
smooth
to
drink
would
definitely
buy
again
and
i
plan
on
getting
a
6
pack
the
next
time
i
make
my
way
to
the
package
store
that
keeps
it
such
an
awesome
beer
overall
this
is
such
a
great
stout
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
a
nice
milk
stout
great
flavor
and
drinkability
a
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
awhile
but
it
pays
off
to
reenjoy
it
like
this
mouthfeel
rich
thick
and
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
for
a
stout
expected
a
lot
more
out
of
this
one
honestly
it
was
very
disappointing
o
i
want
to
love
this
as
i
have
gone
through
my
pint
i
keep
nudging
up
the
taste
score
its
just
too
sweet
to
take
over
as
a
go
to
stout
yep
overall
i
used
to
adore
this
beer
but
now
it
feels
mediocre
its
the
beer
for
people
who
people
who
dislike
beer
love
chocolate
or
who
adore
guinness
for
me
it
was
a
great
introduction
to
beer
but
now
i
feel
ive
moved
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
although
i
now
prefer
the
regular
version
to
the
nitro
version
o
a
very
tasty
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
was
pleased
with
this
one
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
edit
no
wonder
this
beer
is
so
rich
and
sticky
not
only
does
it
contain
lactose
but
after
reading
the
ingredients
list
on
the
label
again
i
found
that
they
included
some
flaked
oats
as
well
a
very
nice
touch
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
first
time
trying
it
with
the
nitro
too
really
excellent
beer
with
great
flavor
and
a
good
feel
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
buy
this
again
which
thats
not
an
easy
mark
to
hit
with
me
pretty
drinkable
as
well
the
pint
was
done
too
fast
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
small
brown
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
mildly
toasted
caramel
malt
and
chocolate
taste
of
sweet
dark
caramel
malt
mildly
toasted
come
cacao
and
milk
chocolate
light
bitterness
a
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
body
on
the
palate
finished
with
some
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
some
cacao
flavor
and
sweet
milk
chocolate
with
some
light
bitterness
for
balance
its
a
good
drinking
after
dinner
brew
appearance
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
in
color
supporting
a
thin
dissipating
head
leaving
nil
lace
smell
of
definate
coffee
roasted
malt
taste
has
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
leaving
a
bitter
mixed
with
the
hops
having
a
light
sweetness
in
the
throughout
mouthfeel
is
full
with
light
fitting
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
enjoyable
stout
a
really
nice
stout
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
there
is
a
sweetness
that
keeps
things
from
getting
too
dry
and
bitter
ends
up
balancing
nicely
i
sampled
this
at
a
beer
fest
over
the
summer
but
only
now
have
the
chance
to
properly
review
and
appreciate
it
and
glad
i
tried
it
a
really
nice
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
i
love
pretty
much
everything
from
left
hand
but
this
thing
is
so
bold
perfect
about
a
hearty
meal
sticks
to
the
glass
like
oil
now
i
have
to
go
get
some
when
i
get
off
work
well
i
dont
want
to
say
anything
else
but
my
comment
has
to
be
250
characters
long
so
this
is
just
a
bunch
of
bs
to
get
there
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
its
nicely
balanced
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
ill
have
to
keep
it
in
rotation
of
milk
stouts
to
get
and
keep
on
hand
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
o
a
very
good
beer
you
can
have
two
of
these
before
you
need
to
change
it
up
well
balanced
not
over
the
top
not
incredibly
interesting
but
enough
to
keep
you
at
the
table
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
o
3
5
lhms
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
very
well
balanced
silky
smooth
o
similar
in
taste
to
the
avery
out
of
bounds
stout
i
had
and
reviewed
recently
but
a
little
more
stoutly
and
more
carbonation
id
take
this
one
over
averys
although
at
least
in
my
area
averys
price
point
deserves
the
a
it
gives
itself
on
their
labeling
1
25
is
always
better
than
2
if
you
are
the
buyer
especially
if
you
are
part
scottish
the
lactose
in
this
stout
adds
a
nice
caramel
flavor
that
cuts
through
the
roastiness
of
the
malt
sippable
soft
texture
with
an
array
of
subtle
flavors
from
front
to
back
a
little
bit
chocolatey
its
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
a
pretty
pour
not
much
head
very
dark
with
low
carbonation
id
drink
this
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
with
a
lighter
feel
that
didnt
compromise
on
flavor
overall
one
of
my
most
enjoyed
milk
stouts
the
head
and
the
carbonation
level
are
the
only
things
i
would
alter
best
guinness
a
chap
can
buy
this
is
my
favorite
beer
so
far
rich
and
creamy
with
a
distinct
coffee
flavor
that
i
love
great
head
after
pouring
and
pairs
very
well
with
a
burger
and
fries
i
really
dont
have
any
criticisms
of
it
its
even
pretty
to
look
at
in
the
glass
with
a
rich
chocolatey
brown
with
the
fluffy
white
head
on
top
if
anything
the
sweetness
and
heaviness
of
it
borders
on
making
it
seasonal
autumn
and
winter
you
wouldnt
drink
this
with
a
salad
or
on
the
beach
its
much
more
cozy
and
filling
overall
love
love
love
o
a
very
easy
drinking
flavorful
milk
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
its
really
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
ive
ever
had
the
beer
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
worthy
of
repeat
purchase
thick
bear
with
a
dark
chocolaty
head
head
less
substantial
than
i
had
hoped
another
creamy
milk
stout
from
the
collection
i
really
do
like
stouts
mild
creamy
chocolate
with
some
coffee
tones
not
too
much
a
good
solid
milk
stout
mouthfeel
is
really
good
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
a
perennial
favorite
with
a
wonderful
chocolate
coffee
and
lactose
smell
a
malty
taste
and
a
creamy
if
not
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
poured
into
pint
glass
jet
black
showing
a
bit
of
dark
brown
in
light
with
a
thick
tan
head
smells
the
same
as
the
nitro
it
should
its
the
same
beer
just
different
gas
tastes
the
same
as
well
the
only
difference
is
the
mouthfeel
really
the
carbonation
really
gives
this
what
it
needs
although
i
may
have
gotten
a
flat
bottle
of
the
nitro
my
ratings
for
this
one
would
be
improved
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
the
same
otherwise
it
certainly
doesnt
line
up
with
what
others
are
saying
in
there
reviews
i
cant
see
how
so
many
are
rating
it
above
a
3
5
o
im
glad
my
local
wegmans
had
these
in
craft
a
six
pack
because
this
is
a
uniquely
wellcrafted
brew
go
out
and
get
one
overall
a
very
solid
milksweet
stout
and
probably
the
best
use
of
nitro
ive
had
so
far
the
nitro
adds
creamyness
without
taking
away
from
the
other
flavors
o
its
not
quite
the
supercreamy
nitro
that
youd
have
on
a
draft
system
and
theres
no
widget
but
it
works
really
well
lots
of
delicious
roast
character
with
a
great
sugar
balance
and
silky
mouthfeel
rich
for
a
stout
of
this
abv
overall
certainly
a
tasty
milk
stout
interesting
to
do
the
comparison
between
the
two
would
say
nitro
wins
out
if
somebody
you
know
is
a
guinness
drinker
invite
them
to
try
this
its
everything
that
guinness
is
but
quite
a
lot
better
this
is
an
excellent
interpretation
of
a
stout
and
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
tasted
not
overly
rich
for
a
stout
but
very
nice
in
flavor
and
body
this
is
an
extreamly
sessionable
easy
to
drink
stout
love
it
would
strongly
recommend
to
any
dark
beerstout
lover
o
nice
version
of
a
milk
stout
extremely
drinkable
and
great
stout
characteristics
cheers
overall
very
smooth
and
rich
in
flavor
will
buy
again
i
had
the
nitro
version
very
delicious
even
better
on
nitro
than
the
regular
left
hand
milk
stout
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
never
have
a
problem
tipping
a
few
of
these
back
also
had
the
nitro
in
the
bottle
not
as
good
as
on
tap
but
still
has
an
amazing
smooth
and
deep
flavor
to
it
pretty
tasty
and
i
forgot
to
buy
ice
cream
i
this
would
taste
pretty
good
with
a
half
scoop
of
french
vanilla
floating
in
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
some
coffee
taste
is
big
on
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
are
present
pretty
good
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ive
had
the
regular
the
nonnitro
version
several
times
but
that
one
takes
the
cake
in
my
opinion
very
fun
to
look
at
and
drink
give
me
dark
or
give
me
death
thanks
to
my
brother
for
brigning
this
keep
reading
its
much
better
on
draft
the
taste
and
feel
meld
nicely
together
as
there
is
a
smooth
creamy
sweetness
touches
of
burnt
malts
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
can
all
be
found
in
a
dry
overall
atmosphere
final
thoughts
the
stout
style
is
a
classic
and
the
modern
milk
stout
is
a
sweet
twist
on
that
style
while
the
nitro
version
is
quite
good
the
carbonated
milk
stout
is
just
average
still
i
like
seeing
breweries
making
this
style
of
beer
i
was
starting
to
think
brewers
forgot
how
to
make
a
stout
without
the
word
imperial
in
the
name
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
but
only
on
nitro
the
sweetness
comes
on
strong
with
the
first
sip
and
remains
sweet
throughout
also
there
are
mellower
mild
hops
in
the
background
ends
slightly
dry
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
good
for
a
more
standard
stout
but
not
over
the
top
i
get
the
lactose
sugar
feeling
in
my
mouth
like
i
just
drank
milk
but
this
beer
is
pretty
basic
for
a
stout
not
bad
by
any
means
not
overall
impressive
though
either
overall
this
was
a
hard
beer
to
rate
for
me
the
looks
and
mouthfeel
were
a
homerun
but
the
taste
and
smell
which
are
far
more
important
were
not
there
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
and
see
the
difference
but
out
of
this
bottle
it
just
a
so
so
brew
i
would
drink
this
again
anytime
cow
on
the
label
or
not
very
solid
sweet
deliciousness
fairly
light
extremely
smooth
slight
sugary
taste
if
youre
told
to
drink
your
milk
this
is
where
you
should
start
better
than
chocolate
milk
wouldnt
mind
just
a
hint
more
of
bitterness
or
burning
taste
but
nevertheless
this
goes
down
so
easy
so
smooth
so
tasty
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
from
left
hand
o
this
is
what
i
always
want
guinness
to
be
like
the
nitro
makes
this
tasty
beer
very
smooth
and
highly
quaffable
without
being
watery
this
is
an
excellent
choice
for
stout
lovers
or
anyone
who
likes
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
my
go
to
milk
stout
the
offering
in
a
nitro
bottle
is
a
plus
as
i
felt
the
end
product
poured
into
a
glass
had
more
of
a
velvety
milkshake
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
everything
a
milk
stout
should
be
toasty
and
roasted
dark
malts
with
a
balanced
milk
sugar
sweetness
with
a
lingering
flavor
of
milk
chocolate
cmon
whats
not
to
like
o
ive
been
told
and
read
this
is
americas
stout
im
not
sure
id
go
that
far
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
its
style
youll
find
and
one
thats
easy
to
find
at
that
this
is
a
real
dandy
of
a
stout
and
while
left
hand
keeps
to
the
basics
of
this
style
thats
what
makes
it
so
good
sometimes
the
good
things
dont
have
to
be
pounded
with
a
high
abv
but
just
crafted
in
a
manner
that
sticks
to
a
styles
roots
thats
what
the
left
hand
milk
stout
is
all
about
something
any
of
us
can
buy
and
left
satisfied
by
the
experience
if
you
are
into
milk
stouts
this
is
a
top
shelf
creation
but
unlike
some
sweeter
stouts
this
one
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
a
wonderful
drinkable
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
as
a
gateway
o
best
milk
stout
ive
had
bar
none
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
taste
this
on
a
nitro
tap
o
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
guiness
draught
with
a
bit
more
creaminess
its
sessionable
but
very
lacking
o
meh
least
favorite
offering
in
a
style
i
love
the
taste
is
very
smooth
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
milk
are
my
first
thought
a
little
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
in
there
as
well
lightbodied
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
solid
beer
all
around
o
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
ever
seen
good
smell
but
the
tapered
off
a
little
from
there
the
flavor
was
just
a
little
underwhelming
good
solid
stout
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
but
not
one
that
will
blow
your
taste
buds
away
a
much
better
version
of
a
guinness
stout
in
my
opinion
i
love
stouts
and
think
this
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
every
stout
does
not
need
to
have
an
abv
10
to
be
considered
flavorful
and
praiseworthy
this
is
an
example
of
such
a
case
overall
its
a
decent
milksweet
stout
something
id
buy
and
do
buy
semi
regularly
but
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
if
you
drink
it
right
after
a
richertastier
english
chocolatemilksweet
stout
the
non
nitro
version
is
a
waste
of
money
but
the
nitro
is
a
decent
buy
for
an
american
made
milk
stout
poured
hard
from
a
nitrobottle
into
a
tulip
glass
all
i
had
great
black
color
and
thick
head
that
you
want
from
a
nitro
beer
taste
was
less
sweet
and
creamy
than
the
traditional
nonnitro
milk
stout
from
left
hand
wanted
to
have
all
the
same
flavors
with
a
nice
creamy
head
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
after
the
recommended
hard
pour
wife
liked
it
more
than
me
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
freshly
brewed
espresso
taste
begins
with
a
coffee
start
followed
by
some
toasted
grain
and
a
sweet
earthy
finish
rich
mouthfeel
overall
quite
a
nice
milk
stout
very
sweet
almost
a
dessert
beer
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
the
nitro
version
this
is
not
nearly
as
milky
as
i
remember
it
being
maybe
because
i
was
half
drunk
but
i
think
its
a
great

in
the

there
is
an
odd
grassy
tartness
that
doesnt
quite
sit
well
in
classic
examples
overall
though
this
is
a
near
worldclass
beer
imo
this
pours
opaque
black
theres
something
really
cool
about
that
the
smell
is
hearty
you
can
tell
its
a
stout
no
fancy
spices
just
good
ol
black
beer
there
is
really
light
carbonation
which
contributes
to
the
smoothness
and
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
there
is
a
creaminess
that
works
well
with
the
light
carbonation
also
there
is
also
a
note
worthy
thick
head
that
coats
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
stout
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
grab
the
beer
pours
like
black
velvet
with
a
beautiful
near
perfect
head
of
tightly
knit
sand
dunewhite
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
dark
and
impenetrable
to
the
eye
though
presumably
clean
the
beer
leaves
a
sheet
of
medium
width
very
tight
lacing
across
much
of
the
glass
that
eventually
stretches
into
a
long
web
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
nicely
roasty
like
espresso
there
is
also
a
great
lactic
soursugar
smell
in
the
nose
that
lets
you
know
its
a
milk
stout
it
actually
almost
smells
like
a
cappuccino
faint
hints
of
a
caramel
and
toffee
can
also
be
detected
in
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
much
like
the
smell
with
rich
sweet
coffee
with
a
touch
of
roasted
bitter
and
a
touch
of
lactic
sour
the
flavor
begins
as
watery
coffee
with
a
touch
of
milk
before
blooming
into
beautiful
almost
cappuccinolike
flavors
touches
of
toffee
vanilla
and
sour
milk
touch
upon
the
tongue
the
finish
is
a
bit
sour
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
lesser
clone
of
the
finish
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
velvety
with
a
creamy
quality
to
it
the
beers
body
is
medium
and
fluffy
thanks
to
the
nitrogen
bubbles
the
mouth
is
left
wet
with
sour
saliva
overall
this
is
a
lovely
nitro
milk
stout
great
complex
flavors
it
is
a
little
watery
in
the
start
and
honestly
this
beer
is
better
when
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
yes
yes
this
is
obvious
but
it
is
especially
prevalent
with
this
beer
try
this
beer
this
is
a
fine
beer
pours
out
to
a
vast
blackness
an
agressive
pour
yielded
a
very
small
head
the
aroma
gives
forth
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
almost
creamy
but
not
heavy
at
all
this
was
very
much
guinnesslike
but
with
a
real
depth
of
flavor
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
sweet
stout
its
not
overwhelming
or
is
it
underwhelming
the
nitro
bottle
is
a
cool
idea
however
for
me
i
like
my
stouts
with
a
little
more
kick
to
them
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
not
bad
but
ill
probably
only
pick
up
one
or
two
in
a
beer
build
a
pack
rather
than
6
at
a
time
very
good
rendition
of
an
already
good
beer
not
overly
sweet
or
roasty
but
theres
a
touch
of
an
acrid
character
that
is
offputting
when
delivered
you
can
see
the
nitro
bubbles
exuding
from
the
middle
of
the
glass
creating
a
beautiful
caramel
colored
head
upon
first
sip
you
realize
that
the
nitro
has
taken
the
original
milk
stout
to
a
whole
new
level
of
creaminess
and
taste
my
wife
is
not
the
biggest
fan
of
stouts
but
she
always
humors
me
and
tries
them
this
one
was
the
one
that
has
changed
her
mind
and
she
even
ordered
her
own
pint
that
is
a
testament
to
how
good
this
beer
is
because
she
is
very
picky
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
she
loves
it
two
word
descripition
somewhere
between
damned
good
or
beer
shake
a
new
benchmark
a
solid
balance
between
sweet
and
roasty
i
can
see
why
this
gets
the
accolades
it
does
im
sad
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
mouthfeel
is
a
full
and
creamy
mediumheavy
body
simple
with
almost
no
carbonation
really
noticed
it
goes
down
without
leaving
a
coating
o
very
nice
baseline
milk
stout
and
i
liked
the
nitro
play
on
things
despite
the
fact
that
i
messed
up
the
pour
would
try
this
again
4
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
long
lasting
creamy

aroma
is
of
bready
toasted

with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
body
is
medium
and
smooth
burned

bready

brown

finish

bittersweet
very
nice
stout
o
good
not
great
stout
i
applaud
left
hand
for
the
nitro
bottle
definitely
nice
but
still
lacks
greatly
to
a
nitro
tap
the
overall
taste
is
very
sweet
and
tastes
of
strong
cream
coffee
chocolate
oats
and
barely
i
do
not
taste
any
hops
in
this
stout
its
not
a
particularly
thick
stout
but
it
is
sweet
and
the
taste
is
very
good
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
would
compliment
desert
very
nicely
i
get
the
impression
that
cherries
or
anything
with
cherries
cherry
pie
cheesecake
or
cordials
would
compliment
this
stout
very
nicely
would
have
given
this
one
a
5
all
the
way
around
but
it
had
no
head
and
i
can
remember
better
beers
o
very
good
milk
stout
great
beer
to
drink
while
smoking
a
pipe
full
of
a
sweet
tobacco
blend
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
in
a
nitro
bottle
othe
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
the
best
parts
as
they
are
very
subtle
and
smooth
taste
is
good
nothing
stand
out
or
is
too
potent
overall
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
very
smooth
smells
fantastic
and
has
a
subtle
noncomplex
taste
founders
breakfast
stout
was
my
top
stout
but
for
half
the
price
i
wouldnt
hesitate
purchasing
more
left
hand
stout
edit
just
caught
the
nitro
version
extra
smooth
but
lacks
head
get
it
fresh
the
flavor
of
this
beer
holds
up
over
the
years
for
any
lover
of
dark
ales
so
i
give
it
a
55
on
nitro
tap
or
nitro
bottle
and
a
45
for
a
regular
bottle
i
bought
a
case
of
this
so
this
is
not
just
a
review
from
just
having
one
been
quite
disappointed
but
the
taste
is
not
offensive
had
on
tap
last
year
and
thought
the
world
of
it
bottom
line
from
me
is
to
stick
to
the
tap
this
is
a
dark
heavy
stout
but
definitely
not
overpowering
if
you
like
dark
beers
especially
stouts
this
is
a
must
try
i
have
only
tasted
one
other
beer
that
is
similar
to
this
one
cream
and
sugar
please
coffee
lactose
porter
both
are
made
with
lactose
sugars

medium

milder

creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
nice
benchmark
for
the
nitro
milk
stout
although
i
could
definitely
appreciate
some
bolder
flavors
d
wooo
this
is
one
sweet
stout
the
nitrogen
makes
for
a
really
nice
addition
to
a
american
made
milk
stout
truly
oneofakind
get
some
in
the
nitroform
great
easy
drinking
sessionable
stout
kills
guinness
as
far
as
a
nitro
stout
is
concerned
o
i
really
like
this
milk
stout
it
still
has
all
the
sweetness
that
milk
stouts
usually
have
but
it
also
has
a
nice
roasted
coffee
element
this
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
milk
stouts
ive
ever
had
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
really
really
nice
beer
overall
i
really
do
love
the
look
of
this
mainly
due
to
the
nitro
sadly
the
nito
seems
to
have
adverse
effects
on
the
mouthfeel
and
even
the
taste
of
a
beer
to
me
nitro
is
just
a
gimic
that
i
can
do
without
otherwise
a
good
beer
that
really
does
look
cool
o
i
feel
like
i
should
get
back
to
my
bottle
shop
and
buy
all
of
these
before
theyre
gone
its
that
good
going
to
pour
my
second
as
i
finish
this
overall
not
a
bad
brew
its
like
having
an
irish
stout
merged
with
a
milk
stout
its
definitely
a
unique
blend
salud
bottle
agressive
pour
as
bottle
suggests
pours
black
with
brown
head
that
slowly
turns
into
a
thick
layer
of
creamy
foam
aroma
dominated
by
coffee
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
flavors
of
coffee
with
a
touch
of
sweet
cream
a
heavy
beer
made
light
by
nitro
makes
an
easy
beer
to
drink
finishes
without
any
bitterness
overall
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
its
let
down
by
how
i
assume
the
brewers
werent
sure
what
a
milk
stout
actually
was
o
i
had
never
tried
a
milk
stout
or
a
nitro
but
this
combo
is
definitely
a
winner
this
tastes
good
and
is
super
easy
to
drink
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
well
done
left
hand
you
have
inspired
me
to
not
fear
the
milk
stout
and
try
nitro
on
tap
when
i
can
so
thank
you
sitting
back
and
enjoying
it
right
now
overall
this
one
is
sure
to
please
and

aroma
of
vanilla

is
not

as

creamy

the
aroma

some
chocolate

finish
is
kind
of
brandy
of
liquor
not
your
tipical
stout
but
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
you
wanting
to
repeat
poured
from
a
nitro
bottle
luckily
met
the
left
hand
rep
who
told
me
that
to
pour
hard
was
no
joke
beautiful
cascade
on

nearly
black

with
very
light
tan

light
roasty
notes
on
the
nose
but
not
very
much
aroma
sweet
malts
on
the
palate
very
little
hint
of
bitterness
but
not
cloying
in
any
way
while
not
a
terribly
complex
flavor
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
beers
ive
had
a
very
long
while
a
6
beer
that
could
easily
pass
for
a
4
wonderful
palatecoating
mouthfeel
creamy
silky
and
satisfying
maybe
not
the
most
complex
flavor
profile
amongst
stouts
but
this
is
a
beer
i
could
be
happy
drinking
most
any
time
pours
a
dark
oily
brown
topped
with
a
frothy
cream
colored
head
i
expected
a
little
larger
of
a
head
considering
the
nitro
the
aroma
is
wonderful
with
smooth
cream
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
candy
the
taste
reveals
additional
roasty
and
coffee
notes
within
the
flavors
are
not
as
powerful
as
i
expected
and
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
light
in
its
body
and
feel
as
well
it
goes
down
quite
easily
however
ultimately
good
but
a
disappointment
if
you
are
looking
for
a
rich
beer
i
prefer
youngs
or
lancaster
milk
stout
as
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
t
just
didnt
work
for
me
way
too
sweet
and
way
too
flat
to
relly
enjoy
properly
overall
a
nice
milkstout
that
is
tasty
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palate
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
would
drink
one
of
these
again
if
available
note
i
drank
a
nitro
version
a
few
months
later
very
similar
review
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
smooth
no
flavor
over
powers
the
other
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
tasty
beer
but
actually
smells
better
than
it
tastes
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
so
it
will
probably
be
a
while
before
i
get
back
to
this
one
after
this
sixer
is
gone
o
nitro
really
makes
this
beer
its
pretty
solid
and
wellpriced
i
would
so
serve
this
to
the
informed
beer
drinkers
who
are
too
cool
for
coors
light
but
dont
have
the
taste
buds
for
bolder
stuff
cant
wait
to
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
near
future
o
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
with
its
low
abv
i
can
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
this
all
day
however
there
is
nothing
extremely
special
or
complex
about
this
a
great
beer
for
leisure
or
to
introduce
your
friends
to
a
milk
stout
but
it
is
just
missing
some
items
that
would
make
it
more
special
happy
to
have
tried
this
neat
to
have
the
only
bottled
nitrogen
infused
beer
sans
widget
price
is
pretty
high

a
sixer
though
so
im
happy
i
only
picked
up
a
single
i
can
enjoy
a
black
butte
just
as
much
for
a
few
bucks
less
edit
just
drank
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
at
home
my
review
above
and
score
stands
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
extremely
smooth
beer
it
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
and
depth
though
overall
a
super
solid
base
beer
with
a
nice
improvement
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
and
the
improvement
on
the
mouthfeel
is
only
making
this
beer
more
and
more
likely
my
favorite
goto
milk
stout
great
lactic
sweetness
and
roasted
character
with
nice
interplay
between
the
earthy
hops
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
o
this
beer
looks
and
feels
fantastic
could
have
had
a
little
more
taste
to
me
but
still
a
great
beer
bought
a
six
pack
to
try
in
summer
no
disappointment
a
perfect
pour
perfect
way
to
end
a
holiday
evening
the
beer
was
consistent
with
my
winter
review
sweet
but
never
cloying
great
mouth
feel
beautiful
head
that
lasts
and
laces
aromatic
overall
wow
this
is
a
superb
beerthe
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
wonderful
or
add
your
favorite
superlative
here
creamy
and
smoothmany
try
a
milk
stout
but
this
one
is
on
an
upper
echelon
top
shelf
servingthe
bottle
calls
it
americas
stout
and
if
this
was
the
one
stout
we
exported
worldwide
id
be
fine
with
that
as
im
sure
japan
would
be
as
wellits
not
a
unique
concept
thats
going
on
but
a
finely
tuned
specimen
that
needs
no
alteration
head
could
be
thicker
but
thats
the
nit
pickiest
thing
i
can
think
of
an
outstanding
brew
that
i
couldnt
recommend
higher
for
anybody
looking
for
a
fantastic
beer
or
an
after
dinner
by
the
fire
sipper4
755
o
the
nitro
transforms
this
beer
from
mediocre
to
very
good
this
really
makes
me
wish
other
breweries
could
bottle
their
stouts
in
nitrobottle
lancaster
milk
stout
nitrobottle
anyone
oi
wish
i
another
bottle
and
definitely
worth
trying
tried
to
make
a
half
and
half
or
black
and
tan
with
the
new
glarus
apple
ale
with
limited
success
this
was
a
case
where
the
sum
was
greater
than
the
parts
as
the
combination
particularly
around
the
separation
line
was
awesome
cheers
o
this
is
a
brew
that
i
will
continue
to
go
back
to
o
this
beer
kicks
ass
its
luscious
and
creamy
and
everything
its
supposed
to
be
i
would
have
scored
this
beer
even
higher
if
they
would
have
made
the
pouring
instructions
more
prevalent
and
obvious
because
it
makes
that
much
of
a
difference
in
fact
if
you
wanted
a
slightly
thinner
beer
with
more
roast
and
coffee
notes
you
can
just
pour
a
little
slower
still
real
hard
just
not
as
violently
you
should
experiment
also
i
would
have
included
chocolate
in
the
description
on
the
packaging
also
i
e
chocolate
milk
stout
because
this
is
a
great
chocolate
milk
stout
unless
terrapin
releases
moohoo
on
nitro
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
now
im
a
sucker
for
milk
stouts
especially
on
nitro
but
i
didnt
think
theyd
pull
it
off
in
the
bottle
i
was
wrong
thank
you
left
hand
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
my
favorite
of
the
night
a
nice
standard
milk
stout
not
overly
complex
and
nice
to
finish
off
the
evening
poured
it
aggressively
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
big
thick
head
thats
and
inch
or
so
thick
smells
so
nice
like
fresh
brew
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
smell
taste
just
like
it
smells
flavors
became
more
pronounced
as
the
stout
warmed
nice
and
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
again
if
youve
passed
on
this
beer
before
i
suggest
you
pick
up
a
six
pack
and
enjoy
an
excellent
beer
my
first
from
left
hand
im
big
into
stouts
but
i
rank
this
as
my
alltime
favorite
thus
far
pours
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
thick
off
white
head
that
leaves
alot
of
lacing
on
edge
of
glass
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
coffee
shop
and
a
dark
chocolate
bar
looks
amazing
taste
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
mild
chocolate
sweetness
balances
with
the
bitter
roasted
coffee
very
good
stout
o
its
a
good
stout
its
well
balanced
flavors
are
good
and
was
about
the
standard
price
per
bottle
for
a
craft
beer
so
it
was
worth
it
and
is
worth
a
try
very
creamy
milky
toasted
stout
a
female
friend
of
mine
who
hates
all
beer
has
become
a
regular
left
hand
stout
drinker
which
says
a
lot
very
drinkable
a
nice
presentation
of
the
style
d
highly
drinkable
good
in
cold
and
hot
weather
o
other
than
bumping
up
the
appearance
score
i
see
no
reason
to
revisit
the
nitro
bottle
option
of
this
brew
i
guess
you
just
cant
underestimate
the
importance
of
a
top
notch
mouthfeel
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
but
my
personal
preference
is
for
a
sixer
of
the
regular
bottles
cheers
o
solid
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
itd
be
a
nice
alternative
to
a
guinness
draft
or
a
good
beer
for
someone
newer
into
craft
or
into
stouts
supersolid
sweet
stout
with
tons
of
flavor
the
nitro
bottle
is
awesome
i
like
taste
and
smell
was
pretty
on
par
with
a
good
milk
stout
sweet
lactose
and
chocolately
with
just
a
bit
of
coffee
notes
ive
had
better
and
worse
but
the
nitrobottle
is
definitely
worth
another
try
overall
a
really
good
dessert
beer
in
which
one
is
definately
enough
but
you
would
still
want
to
drink
it
again
overall
very
smooth
i
would
like
a
little
more
bold
flavor
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
sweet
stout
it
touches
on
many
of
the
key
components
for
a
solid
stout
the
color
is
good
although
i
can
till
see
through
it
and
the
head
retention
is
strong
i
have
had
other
sweet
stouts
and
this
one
is
maybe
not
the
best
but
right
up
there
o
good
stuff
solid
not
blown
away
by
it
but
not
disappointed
either
this
beer
poured
up
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
beautiful
and
lucious
one
finger
head
the
color
of
the
nougat
inside
a
three
musketeers
bar
retention
was
fairly
poor
and
there
was
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
malt
coffee
and
soy
sauce
taste
is
very
sweet
and
errs
to
that
side
rather
than
to
the
bitter
however
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
more
carbonation
than
i
would
have
expected
for
a
stout
not
bad
at
all
an
enjoyable
beer
when
i
am
not
looking
for
the
typical
810
stouts
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
stouts
easy
to
have
a
couple
of
these
on
a
weeknight
and
still
carry
on
a
coherent
conversation
the
sweetness
is
really
nice
on
a
cooler
night
just
a
very
satisfying
stout
o
nice
brew
here
overall
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
good
one
for
when
you
want
a
sweet
stout
fix
heck
my
old
mans
a
die
hard
bud
light
drinker
and
after
he
willingly
tried
a
sip
he
said
hey
thats
tasty
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
thought
this
was
nice
nothing
too
adventurous
about
it
but
very
enjoyable
i
had
the
regular
milk
stout
not
the
nitro
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip

5got
to
give
it
to
left
hand
for
going
with
the
nitro
here
for
some
reason
brewers
seem
to
have
an
aversion
to
nitro
these
days
not
sure
why
could
be
due
to
the
bad
rants
about
it
a
few
years
back
which
claimed
that
nitro
takes
away
from
the
flavor
i
never
agreed
with
that
great
beer
and
smart
move
by
left
hand
taking
advantage
of
the
rarity
ill
try
almost
any
beer
on
nitro
these
days
since
it
doesnt
happen
that
often

but
the
lactose
sweetness
still
showed
up
as
i
remember
and
it
was
just
the
right
amount
this
beer
has
pretty
good
drinkability
i
had
to
hold
it
right
up
to
light
bulb
to
see
the
date
and
even
then
it
was
pretty
smudged
and
not

you
would

four
months
wouldnt
hurt
this
beer
that
much
but
it
is
pretty
obvious
that
the
roast
flavors
faded
quickly
in
this
beer
i
am
going
to
try
and
get
a
fresh

and

it

that

i
was
impressed
with
the
cascade
action
a
creamy
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
its
a
shame
that
it
is
not
a
more
common
style
one
of
the
more
easily
drinkable
beers
i
have
has
despite
it
being
a
stout
and
honestly
the
flavors
lend
itself
to
be
a
great
breakfast
beer
when
you
need
that
little
something
extra
overall
it
hink
it
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
it
is
not
overly
sweet
like
some
of
them
highly
recommended
cost
2
50
for
a
single
12
oz
beer
or
10
99
for
a
six
pack
i
like
this
one
its
a
good
milk
stout
thats
not
too
sweet
the
burnt
notes
really
add
some
balance
where
hops
usually
would
pours
a
black
with
absolutely
no
head
despite
a
rough
pour
not
sure
if
i
have
an
old
bottle
no
date
that
i
can
find
anywhere
on
the
bottle
smells
like
very
toasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
very
roasted
dark
coffee
and
a
moderate
bitter
finish
doesnt
taste
flat
despite
no
head
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
probably
wont
buy
again
pretty
well
made
stuff
and
uh
its
a
nitro
bottle
so
the
mouthfeel
is
supposed
to
be
thinner
guys
dee
duh
dee
dr
quite
drinkable
and
of
pretty
good
quality
nitro
was
an
excellent
choice
i
fancy
it
and
so
will
other
fans
of
stouts
o
a
very
good
dark
beer
would
highly
recommend
i
think
theyre
onto
something
here
a
great
drinkable
stout
now
creamier
and
more
fun
just
plain
drinkable
the
left
hand
milk
stout
was
on
tap
at
the
kendall
pub
in
yorkville
il
the
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
and
was
a
dark
opaque
color
with
a
creamy
froth
head
that
laced
nicely
the
smell
is
sweet
choclate
and
roast
with
hints
of
espresso
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
beer
tastes
amazing
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
mixed
with
a
touch
of
dark
malts
a
great
mouthfeel
makes
this
go
down
very
very
smooth
this
is
the
perfect
session
beer
for
me
its
not
watery
nor
is
it
too
heavy
overall
i
love
this
beer
for
every
reason
its
beautiful
to
loo
at
as
it
goes
down
it
tastes
awesome
and
its
not
too
heavy
at
all
even
at
6
mouthfeeloverall
lightmedium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
overall
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
i
have
tried
by
any
stretch
had
heard
some
good
things
about
this
but
not
super
impressed
this
was
my
first
time
trying
anything
from
left
hand
and
i
was
quite
pleased
just
from
looking
at
it
after
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
could
tell
it
was
going
to
be
a
creamy
and
smooth
blend
i
couldnt
pick
up
too
much
of
a
scent
but
the
flavors
that
came
through
were
that
of
a
light
malt
roast
and
wasnt
too
rough
on
the
tongue
very
sweet
and
tasty
brew
and
overall
a
strong
milk
stout
i
had
a
sweet
pint
of
this
exciting
concotion
at
the
spotty
dog
in
hudson
ny
it
was
a
very
creamy
sugared
milk
dense
stout
whos
flavor
resonated
in
my
mouth
for
hours
after
the
pint
was
gone
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
absolutely
have
another
pint
if
i
came
across
it
in
the
future
a
overall
this
is
a
nice
milk
stout
a
new
style
i
am
trying
to
get
accustomed
too
still
plenty
more
to
try
out
and
i
am
sure
i
will
have
a
few
of
these
when
i
will
be
going
to
denver
in
a
few
days
still
looking
for
a
little
more
sweetness
of
this
still
a
good
beer
though
i
remember
back
before
i
turned
21
and
hadnt
had
much
to
drink
other
than
swill
and
jungle
juice
at
parties
people
would
tell
me
that
guiness
was
like
a
meal
i
was
so
dissapointed
when
i
finally
had
a
guiness
it
was
thin
and
watery
and
sour
and
kind
of
lame
this
is
what
i
imagined
guiness
would
be
like
based
on
other
peoples
description
just
good
nourishing
for
the
body
and
soul
o
worth
a
shot
if
you
get
the
chance
wish
they
could
improve
the
price
point
though
i
guess
someones
gotta
pay
for
all
that
rumored
rd
overall
its
an
absolutely
solid
stout
while
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
rich
as
the
smell
is
it
still
a
great
stout
thats
very
easy
to
drink
and
easy
on
the
mouth
too
overall
i
have
to
say
its
possible
i
had
a
bad
bottle
though
i
didnt
detect
any
of
the
normal
indicators
of
a
bad
bottle
but
this
stout
was
not
up
my
alley
it
had
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
and
taste
which
may
just
be
the
style
but
again
not
for
me
at
all
comparisonreference
like
a
creamier

poured
this

into

had

of
this

beer
about

inch
of

dark

if
it
was

will

this

i
would

seek
out
again
this
is
not
heavy
its
an

drinker
tasty
and
smooth
all
around
taste
is
very
nice
for
about
one
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
to

muliple
reminds
me
of
chocolate

slight
hint
of
roasted

not

chewy
and
would
go
great
with
a

is

body
is

thin
considering
the
creamy

i
would

more
a
great
beer
i
could
make
an
easy
evening
of
this
d
im
sorry
but
i
was
not
impressed
i
like
milk
stouts
but
i
dont
know
if
this
bottle
was
bad
or
not
the
date
was
fine
maybe
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
at
some
point
down
the
road
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout
that
is
only
held
back
on
drinkability
by
the
dominance
of
the
sweetness
still
a

drinkability
easy
to

this
would
be
a
great
stout
for
a
beginner
good
flavor
very
drinkable
due
to
the
creaminess
a
very
dark
stout
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
cream
sugar
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of

the
taste
is

chocolate
milk
brown
sugar
a

of
floral
and
vanilla
and
spice
very
velvety
creamy
mouth
feel

i
like
this
beer
very
much
overalla
well
made
milk
stout
light
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
well
worth
a
purchase
yet
another
damn
good
beer
from
left
hand
i
didnt
care
for
the
first
few
i
tried
but
these
last
ones
are
dead
on
aroma
of
vanilla
milk
and
malt
pour
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
ring
of
a
head
the
taste
was
delicious
milky
and
sweet
with
nice
carbonation
and
just
the
right
mouthfeel
milk
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
in
the
front
and
a
creamy
aftertaste
i
love
sweet
stouts
and
this
is
a
great
one
good
enough
to
enjoy
but
a
little
too
mild
and
a
little
too
sweet
not
real
robust
or
flavorful
mackesons
has
nothing
to
fear
from
this
one
i
am
currently
drinking
this
after
the
pour
the
color
is
very
dark
almost
ruby
in
color
the
head
is
thin
but
typical
for
a
stout
the
taste
is
caramel
chocolate
a
hint
of
the
milk
when
it
finishes
and
is
sweet
for
those
who
drink
stout
it
would
be
considered
on
the
mid
level
end
i
would
put
it
below
guinness
and
way
below
rasputin
a
good
stout
but
not
great
d
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
drinking
it
at
a
colder
temp
them
recommended
but
it
still
tastes
really
good
decent
little
sweet
stout
this
one
is
ive
had
it
a
few
times
and
its
good
but
not
great
a
decent
stout
nothing
overly
complex
but
enjoyable
d
call
me
crazy
but
even
with
the
odd
flavor
this
beer
seemed
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
what
that
overpowering
characteristic
was
but
it
didnt
ruin
it
for
me
it
was
just
different
id
like
to
try
another
sample
a
simple
dependable
straightforward
beer
not
the
most
complex
but
worth
having
a
sixpack
every
couple
months
strange
one
this
not
rich
or
really
creamy
as
a
true
milk
stout
should
be
an
ok
beer
but
missing
something
in
its
style
i
love
the
initial
flavor
i
enjoy
the
sourness
and
coffee
flavor
as
i
continue
to
drink
them
they
get
less
and
less
impressive
though
i
think
this
would
make
a
top
shelf
session
beer
though
i
plan
on
sharing
this
with
friends
at
our
next
tasting
drinkability
is
good
though
nice
enjoyable
easy
drinking
stout
not
over
complex
or
kick
you
in
the
ass
you
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
make
a
good
choice
for
nice
evening
session
brews
pours
a
pretty
darn
black
color
with
some
ruby
hints
at
the
edges
and
a
minimal
and
short
lived
tan
head
smell
is
quite
nice
at
first
this
beer
smells
overwhelming
sweet
but
the
quickly
fades
and
this
beer
evens
out
a
bit
with
roasted
notes
become
dominant
through
not
overpowering
coffee
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
are
present
with
a
very
nice
creamlike
sweetness
lingering
in
the
background
taste
is
like
the
aroma
roasted
flavors
are
dominant
and
take
on
cocoa
and
coffee
notes
in
the
order
bitterness
is
just
sjy
of
moderate
and
sweetness
is
moderate
making
for
an
interesting
finish
where
the
attenuation
of
the
beer
as
well
as
the
roasted
grains
combine
for
a
drying
effect
while
the
added
lactose
provides
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
bit
more
on
the
roasted
side
but
the
sweetness
shines
through
a
bit
more
at
times
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
maybe
a
bit
light
or
the
style
with
what
id
characterize
as
only
a
medium
body
despite
the
residual
sugars
for
the
lactose
the
lactose
seems
to
enhance
the
body
a
bit
but
this
still
seems
a
bit
thin
carbonation
is
spot
on
at
a
lowmoderate
level
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
think
that
the
more
moderate
body
while
a
bit
light
for
the
style
helps
make
this
a
bit
more
quaffable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
yet
interesting
d
impressive
offering
that
coupled
smoothly
with
skeletonwitch
on
the
eve
of
the
coolest
holiday
nice
stout
lean
but
decent
nonetheless
roasted
aroma
with
a
kick
of
sweetness
sugary
and
appealing
poured
a
semitransparent
dark
brown
medium
head
that
quickly
dwindled
and
no
lacing
thin
for
a
stout
but
he
smoothness
helps
alleviate
this
flavor
is
good
creamy
and
sweet
which
really
counters
the
roasted
bitterness
not
blown
away
but
its
a
very
drinkable
tasty
stout
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
a
bit
creamier
than
some
other
milk
stouts
ive
had
not
my
favorite
stout
not
even
my
favorite
milk
stout
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
overall
excellent
choice
future
outlook
barring
unforeseen
circumstances
repeat
business
not
expected
to
occur
thankful
to
have
purchased
only
a
single
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
easy
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
unique
taste
with
the
first
few
sips
but
the
sourness
gains
the
more
you
drink
and
near
the
end
is
nothing
impressive
nor
desired
i
would
not
drink
another
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
than
a
sweetmilk
stout
as
there
isnt
much
lactose
flavor
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
aroma
is
rich
with
chocolate
grains
and
fresh
java
the
flavor
follows
the
same
notes
with
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
almost
like
hot
chocolate
but
with
a
mild
bitter
black
pepper
finish
the
body
is
neither
too
thick
or
thin
call
it
just
right
theres
a
obvious
roasted
taste
and
bitter
feel
in
addition
to
the
hops
and
while
i
wouldnt
drink
this
all
night
its
good
for
a
few
pint
fulls
left
hands
milk
stout
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
thick
heavy
almost
sticky
feeling
in
your
mouth
with
the
characteristic
milk
stout
sweetness
this
is
probably
a
terrific
brew
for
guinness
drinkers
with
a
sweet
tooth
if
youre
looking
for
an
imperial
stout
youre
looking
in
the
wrong
place
d
a
solid
drinkable
stout
though
not
as
sweet
as
id
expected
it
isnt
overthetop
dry
and
provides
a
refreshing
take
on
the
style
emphasizing
coffee
over
chocolate
and
caramel
perhaps
slightly
off
the
beaten
path
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
taste
was
sweet
no
joke
not
candycloying
but
definitely
sweet
what
i
found
astounding
was
the
real
milky
taste
and
mouth
feel
i
liked
the
eversoslight
dry
bitter
finish
overall
just
so
smooth
like
chocolate
milk
i
will
drink
more
a
black
thick
body
with
a
light
tan
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
minor
lacings
a
light

smell
a
little
weak
and
a

medium

a
smooth
and
semicreamy
mouth
texture
there
are
some
sweet
and
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
but
they
are
not
overly
prevelant
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
good
but
i
was
expecting
more
not
the
greatest
of
stouts
not
meant
to
be
a
criticism
this
was
the
first
left
hand
brew
i
ever
had
found
it
in
a
river
in
the
rockies
just
like
busch
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
tasty
milk
stout
very
ordinary
to
look
at
smells
very
milkstouty
tastes
great
creamy
chocolatey
cocoa
puffs
flavor
which
melds
perfectly
with
the
mouthfeel
combine
all
this
with
the
low
abv
and
its
a
highly
drinkable
beverage
m
d
a
nice
shimmer
of
carbonation
and
a
reasonable
creaminess
might
have
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
fuller
but
its
still
a
decent
feel
not
a
big
fave
but
id
give
it
another
chance
d
very
drinkable
stout
definately
worth
a
try
highly
recommended
well
done
boys
appearance
is
pretty
good
a
very
dark
black
with
a
slightly
tan
colored
head
and
some
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
good
this
tastes
like
sweet
milky
coffee
with
a
dry
after
taste
that
dissapates
quickly
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
body
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
after
one
of
these
ive
had
enough
on
to
something
else
d
definitely
has
the
roasty
and
chocolate
taste
that
i
crave
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
pours
a
very
dark
black
color
with
very
little
brown
toned
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
a
very
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
at
first
its
a
tad
bitter
and
tangy
with
small
notes
of
hops
but
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
all
the
way
through
good
beer
smooth
throughout
easy
to
drink
great
stout
very
enjoyable
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
and
i
mean
very
slightly
thin
for
the
style
but
with
flavor
like
this
i
could
really
give
a
damn
this
stuff
is
downright
tasty
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
not
too
bitter
and
quite
tasty
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweetness
and
roastyness
that
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
ok
going
down
but
not
that
remember
or
special
i
dont
think
i
could
reach
for
this
again
but
its
fairly
enjoyable
nice
but
typical
and
typical
is
just
ok
out
of
the
bomber
this
beer
was
an
almostblack
with
some
deep
garnet
highlights
near
the
edges
the
head
was
tan
about
two
fingers
thick
but
quickly
became
a
minimal
skim
that
did
not
lace
very
well
the
aromas
were
sweet
and
rich
hersheys
syrup
milk
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
caramel
malts
the
flavors
were
at
first
dominated
by
the
smoky
roasted
malt
flavors
and
coffee
followed
closely
by
the
chocolate
sweetness
silky
mouthfeel
very
creamy
and
filling
hints
of
vanilla
develop
as
it
warms
well
rounded
drinkable
and
rewarding
in
a
desertlike
way
without
being
overly
sweet
recommended
d
a
good
stout
but
much
less
sweet
than
most
of
the
milk
stouts
i
have
had
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
might
be
a
little
too
rich
and
sweet
for
some
but
outstanding
in
my
book
dgreat
version
of
this
style
goes
great
with
vanilla
ice
cream
smooth
and
silky
without
being
viscous
lactic
twang
emerges
with
the
alcohol
at
the
end
neither
are
distracting
but
rather
welcome
and
the
chocolate
never
subsides
it
is
maybe
more
heavily
toasted
than
what
i
would
expect
from
a
milk
stout
but
i
still
love
it
im
not
a
judge
but
a
guy
who
likes
good
beer
this
does
all
the
things
for
me
i
want
from
a
stout
imagine
if
it
were
stored
cold
and
not
a
year
old
maybe
it
just
ages
nicely
looking
forward
from
more
left
hand
stuff
d
very
very
drinkable
this
one
will
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
from
now
on
unless
i
find
something
better
definitely
a
great
session
beer
not
too
filling
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
start
drinking
this
at
5
p
m
and
still
be
drinking
it
at
2
a
m
overall
a
good
milk
stout
that
is
not
overly
complex
but
has
the
necessities
in
there
drinkability
a
really
great
milk
stout
and
one
im
pleased
to
finally
review
even
though
the
venue
may
not
have
been
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
one
id
love
to
have
at
home
on
a
cold
winter
night
or
paired
with
a
heavy
dessert
the
abv
was
completely
manageable
and
nothing
was
too
sweet
or
cloying
an
excellent
milk
stout
pours
a
nice
black
with
amberruby
highlights
and
a
nice
fluffy
light
tan
head
nose
is
alot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
follows
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
a
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
and
that
lactose
kick
a
solid
malt
profile
with
a
nice
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
suprisingly
refreshing
for
a
beer
of
this
darkness
and
body
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
surely
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
out
there
i
am
glad
to
see
more
of
this
style
getting
some
recognition
good
beer
smooth
brew
its
not
over
carbonated
and
the
flavors
coat
your
entire
mouth
as
you
drink
the
finish
is
a
little
chalky
for
my
taste
but
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
beverage
picked
up
a
six
pack
to
give
the
beer
a
second
try
the
first
try
was
a
single
bottle
in
a
beer
bar
i
have
got
to
say
that
upon
a
second
tasting
the
aroma
was
more
pronounced
not
really
different
than
the
first
time
just
more
robust
same
with
the
taste
except
that
i
got
that
hint
of
sweetness
that
i
was
looking
for
upon
further
review
a
much
better
beer
than
i
gave
it
credit
for
mdmouthfeel
is
extremly
light
with
almost
no
hints
of
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
brew
just
dont
expect
to
be
real
blown
away
overall
i
think
this
is
probably
a
nice
tasty
dependable
beer
not
something
ill
ever
crave
maybe
something
ill
revisit
didnt
blow
my
socks
off
but
essentially
left
me
wanting
to
see
what
others
in
this
style
have
to
offer
this
one
was
approachable
but
i
dont
think
it
will
become
a
habit
from
what
i
have
read
this
may
be
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
i
find
it
to
be
a
nice
pleasant
drinking
dark
beer
i
poured
well
with
a
wonderful
creamy
head
if
smooth
and
creamy
is
what
you
are
looking
for
this
may
be
your
beer
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
as
are
all
milk
stouts
it
first
tastes
like
a
nice
cold
sweet
cream
coffee
then
comes
the
character
of
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
the
finish
is
similar
to
that
of
tiramisu
or
of
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
it
would
make
a
wonderful
compliment
to
a
large
dinner
with
dessert
i
prefer
a
nice
brew
to
scotch
anyway
great
beeralthough
a
little
on
the
light
side
from
a
not
so
great
company
kudos
definitely
recommend
its
a
very
good
low
abv
stout
check
it
out
if
you
can
get
it
its
not
quite
as
good
as
mackeson
xxx
but
this
one
is
still
a
great
milk
stout
this
is
probably
one
of
the
silkiest
feeling
beers
i
have
had
recommended
i
really
liked
left
hands
black
jack
porter
so
i
thought
id
try
this
it
poured
a
deep
black
with
ruby
edges
into
my
pint
glass
and
smelled
like
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
about
the
same
mostly
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
im
a
sucker
for
milk
stouts
and
this
didnt
disappoint
but
ive
had
better
versions
of
this
style
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
prefer
left
hands
porter
to
this
still
a
great
beer
thats
worth
a
try
d
ehh
a
little
rich
to
be
drinking
more
than
one
however
given
its
style
not
bad
d
due
to
the
richness
of
the
flavors
drinkability
loses
some
points
overall
this
is
an
underrated
beer
that
i
will
surely
revisit
again
this
is
my
first
try
of
lefthand
brewery
that
i
got
on
a
whim
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
oh
and
oddly
enough
i
reached
for
an
amish
cookie
while
i
drank
this
made
the
perfect
pair
for
me
aside
from
2
light
bodied
feel
with
and
extra
creamy
airy
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
from
a
milk
stoutnot
a
style
i
normally
would
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
overall
a
decent
stout
ive
never
had
a
sweet
stout
before
but
i
think
there
are
better
stouts
in
the
world
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
id
drink
it
without
much
of
a
thought
notes
a
great
complementing
characteristic
of
malt
and
hop
grainy
oats
smooth
this
brew
out
making
it
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinker
especially
in
the
summer
heat
creamy
and
smooth
body
another
fine
left
hand
brew
dvery
satisfied
will
look
foward
to
having
another
andor
trying
some
of
left
hands
other
products
pours
thick
and
dark
with
a
brown
one
inch
head
in
my
mug
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
stout
burnt
roasty
smell
with
coffee
cocoa
and
cream
a
smokey
woody
hot
cocoa
almost
taste
kinda
smokey
light
coffee
a
sorta
creamy
presence
from
whatever
milk
is
present
really
the
one
word
i
can
come
up
with
this
is
smokey
but
ill
let
it
warm
up
to
let
it
unfold
the
cream
flavor
opens
up
more
as
it
warms
but
again
its
rather
smokey
with
just
a
hint
of
lingering
coffee
bitterness
and
a
tad
minerally
in
the
finish
i
cant
really
detect
cocoa
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
in
the
smell
i
prefered
my
initial
sniff
of
this
stuff
than
its
taste
as
far
as
drinkability
id
say
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
im
a
bit
dissapointed
in
the
flavor
too
much
smoke
i
was
expecting
milk
chocolate
oh
well
drinkability
is
very
top
notch
id
recommend
drinking
these
on
a
friday
night
with
friends
as
well
as
serving
it
to
people
who
want
a
nice
thick
satisfying
brew
what
a
great
stout
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
smooth
and
ended
very
dry
leaving
you
wanting
more
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
too
many
a
great
beer
id
definitely
have
it
again

good
dose

a
moderate
amount

overall
left
hand
milk
stout
is
a
solid
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
recommended
d
not
too
bad
but
its
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
d
pretty
damn
good
im
into
the
dark
beers
right
now
and
in
the
hot
weather
really
hits
the
spot
without
going
too
intense
solid
drinking
time
taste
is
of
mocha
very
smooth
and
creamy
theres
some
nice
coffee
taste
in
there
as
well
as
its
hidden
by
the
sweetness
at
first
very
nice
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
great
taste
and
very
smooth
a
little
heavy
to
drink
before
i
bbq
but
it
would
be
a
good
dessert
beer
worth
trying
d
too
many
might
weigh
down
in
your
stomach
otherwise
quite
good
ill
admit
i
was
scared
of
this
one
but
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
not
bad
a
flavorful
sweetish
milk
stout
but
having
said
that
the
beer
was
smooth
and
velvetly
if
you
can
get
over
the
taste
as
for
drinkability
if
you
like
coffe
in
your
beergo
for
it
drinkability
is
fairly
high
low
alcohol
and
good
flavor
makes
this
beer
easy
to
consume
nice
carbonation
and
a
great
full
body
i
really
dig
this
beer
smooth
i
would
pay
for
more
of
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
chocolate
and
mild
roastiness
in
the
aroma
flavour
is
very
nice
with
strong
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
some
roasty
coffee
and
sugary
milk
notes
smooth
oh
palate
dry
and
sweet
finish
i
can
definitely
pillage
this
beer
very
smooth
and
creamy
a
good
malty
sweetness
to
it
that
is
balanced
well
with
a
slight
bite
rich
and
velvety
but
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
bham
uk
d
well
its
light
bodied
but
the
overthetop
for
the
style
carbonation
hurts
drinkability
for
me
i
think
of
milk
stouts
as
one
of
the
ultimate
smooth
drinkers
but
this
one
just
wasnt
there
im
giving
a
3
because
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
lot
of
these
down
but
it
isnt
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
i
think
a
milk
stout
should
be
see
mackesons
triple
stout
for
a
better
stylistic
example
that
is
widely
available
full
bodied
and
creamy
but
with
nice
carbonation
to
keep
it
light
on
the
palate
slight
lingering
essencefeeltaste
of
a
starbucks
mocha
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
put
down
a
sixer
of
this
without
thinking
about
it
highly
recommend
because
this
is
a
fine
milk
stout
verdict
worth
picking
up
for
the
fact
that
its
easy
to
drink
this
stout
pours
a
cocacola

a
foamy

that
leaves
lots
of

everywhere
the
nose
is

oreo
cookie
the
taste
is
mild
coffee
with
whole
milk
creamerdark
bitter
chocolateand
vinilla
mousse
this
seems
light
for
a
stout
and
a
little
too
sweet
as
wellbut
its
still
deliciousand
highly
drinkable
smells
of
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
pours
to
an
opaque
dark

but
with

taste

surprisingly
light
for

a
very
good

i
would
drink

i
tasted
this
beer
in
a
12
ounce
bottle
milk
stout
didnt
make
much
sense
to
me
at
first
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
an
excpetional
stout
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
dark
with
a
light
head
and
it
had
a
light
burnt
smell
this
beer
is
exceptionally
smoothe
for
a
stout
and
it
is
certainly
another
beer
i
will
suggest
to
all
my
beer
friends
d
very
tasty
stout
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
but
not
bad
at
all
this
had
a
unique
taste
to
it
i
enjoyed
it
slightly
chilled
in
my
warsteiner
mug
poured
a
dark
black
coffee
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
smelled
of
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
hint
of
creamer
and
mocha
tasted
like
dark
roast
coffee
very
chewy
with
that
sweet
milk
aftertase
that
really
intrigued
me
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
chocolatecocoa
and
espresso
aftertaste
is
the
same
after
you
drink
a
sweetened
cup
of
fresh
coffee
this
is
something
i
would
definetly
recommend
and
buy
againalthough
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
at
one
sitting
md
this
is
a
big
bold
chewy
stout
just
the
way
i
like
em
its
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
incredibly
satisfying
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
light
lending
itself
extremely
well
to
the
creamy
texture
that
is
imparted
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
d
very
enjoyable
beer
great
milk
stout
sweet
and
rich
made
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
highly
recommended
pours
a
beautiful
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
dense
rocky
twofinger

and

is
of
coffee
and
caramel
strong
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
heavy
on
the
chocolate
malts
very
light
on
the
hops
very
creamy
and
rich
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
an
all
around
good
stout
d
this
is
not
a
beer
i
can
recommend
as
i
said
its
simply
too
thin
for
a
stout
of
any
kind
with
such
rich
bold
flavors
i
dont
believe
that
i
could
down
the
whole
sixer
i
would
say
drink
this
about
as
much
as
you
would
chocolate
milk
which
for
me
would
only
be
as
a
sinful
treat
to
myself
aroma
is
strong
and
smoky
with
hints
of
fine
coffee
it
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
chocolate
brown
not
quite
as
dark
as
most
stouts
i
have
tried
head
is
very
thick
tan
finebubbled
and
persistent
flavor
is
rich
with
an
overtone
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
strong
smoky
and
coffee
hints
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
like
burnt
coffee
mixed
with
bitter
chocolate
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
sweet
stouts
i
have
had
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
d
a
very
decent
milk
stout
i
prefer
oatmeals
milks
over
a
dry
stout
i
can
see
having
some
of
these
in
the
fridge
d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
due
to
a
nice
mix
of
a
good
taste
and
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
roasted
taste
balanced
by
the
sweeter
aftertaste
makes
the
beer
excellent
overall
this
beer
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
couldnt
detect
much
else
the
taste
was
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
body
was
a
lot
lighter
than
expected
and
the
carbonation
was
medium
overall
this
beer
was
great
i
wish
we
had
this
beer
in
la
i
say
that
a
lot
pathetic
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
with
2
cm
of
foamy
tan
head
that
is
mostly
diminishing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
smoke
initial
flavor
is
is
chocolate
and
cream
flavor
ends
more
malty
after
taste
lingers
for
a
short
time
light
lacing
next
to
no
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
and
alcohol
didnt
really
make
its
presence
known
very
drinkable
beer
that
pretty
much
follows
what
i
expected
not
mind
blowing
but
a
good
solid
easydrinking
stout
reminds
me
a
bit
of
old
no
38
from
north
coast
brewing
drinkability
ive
reviewed
a
few
milk
stouts
and
it
is
nice
to
expand
my
palette
with
another
offering
nice
beer
my
first
introduction
to
the
milk
stout
category
and
ill
gladly
go
back
overall
good
but
not
quite
the
quality
i
expect
from
stouts
a
quality
milk
stout
this
was
the
first
beer
from
left
hand
that
i
have
tried
i
will
be
buying
more
and
recommending
this
to
any
stout
fan
i
know
drinkability
this
was
a
very
fun
stout
to
drink
i
constantly
felt
challenged
with
how
to
define
the
tastes
and
smells
i
was
experiencing
the
smoothness
and
the
sweet
tones
really
make
a
relaxing
experience
d
moderate
abv
and
good
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
interesting
mix
of
qualities
that
combine
for
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
of
good
but
not
great
quality
or
satisfaction
mouthfeel
is
obviously
creamy
and
slick
kind
of
filling
so
one
is
enough
for
now
this
is
a
pretty
good
dessert
beer
and
im
glad
it
is
now
in
kc
pours
a
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
slim
tan
head
nose
is
a
nice
cocoa
powder
flavor
is
nice
and
smooth
good
sweet
tone
nice
milky
edge
mild
cocoa
properties
noticeable
roasted
edge
good
smooth
feel
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
i
might
venture
to
say
that
it
could
be
one
to
sway
nonbeer
drinkers
right
on
over
to
our
side
tastes
smooth
as
it
pours
its
sweet
and
feels
like
chocolate
milk
in
your
mouth
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
back
to
back
its
pretty
sweet
and
id
be
crazing
some
hop
bitterness
after
the
second
one
mfd
a
little
thin
with
a
slightly
carbonated
mouthfeel
it
did
however
manage
to
coat
my
mouth
and
allow
the
flavor
to
hang
around
this
is
a
decent
example
of
this
style
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
if
you
enjoy
milksweet
stout
its
definatly
worth
a
try
tried
this
on
tap
last
thursday
at
the
kinsale
in
government
center
came
in
a
pint
glass
and
the
color
was
black
as
night
no
head
whatsoever
and
the
beer
almost
looked
flat
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
malty
and
aromatic
tastewise
this
was
my
first
milk
stout
and
an
interesting
introduction
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
someone
mixed
half
glass
of
stout
with
half
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
it
was
almost
too
sweet
i
would
be
interested
to
try
another
milk
stout
to
see
if
others
are
as
sugary
even
sweeter
than
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
i
think
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
because
it
is
so
sweet
tasting
which
is
fine
but
a
few
sweet
beers
may
not
be
the
best
session
beer
out
there
a
nice
beer
to
try
once
or
to
have
with
a
dessert
dont
have
this
after
an
ipa
like
i
did
d
not
too
sure
how
drinkable
this
beer
would
be
because
of
the
sweetness
but
i
cant
stop
drinking
this
it
had
all
these
great
flavors
but
i
had
to
work
a
little
to
get
them
out
and
it
left
me
wishing
for
just
a
bit
more
a
great
start
and
it
will
get
me
looking
for
more
left
hand
beers
out
of
curiosity
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
16oz
glass
we
have
before
us
a
dark
opaque
beer
which
lets
almost
no
light
through
even
when
held
up
to
a
light
a
tancoloured
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
not
much
lacing
malty
coffee
aromas
coming
from
the
glass
and
these
are
repeated
in
the
taste
with
some
added
caramel
hints
and
the
merest
suggestion
of
hops
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
not
too
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
just
about
right
id
say
overall
a
very
nice
though
not
exactly
exceptional
milk
stout
id
be
very
content
to
drink
this
all
evening
yum
poured
black
with
a
ruby
hue
the
head
was
tan
colored
and
thick
with
tight
bubbles
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
caramel
the
taste
is
roasted
and
chocolaty
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
this
is
a
nice
smooth
beer
that
id
consider
quite
drinkable
but
widmer

is
much
better

its
light

with

this
one
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
pretty
good
this
is
my
second
milk
stout
and
i
really
liked
it
would
drink
again
i
will
say
that
i
think
the
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
is
superior
but
like
i
said
this
was
served
in
pitcher
form
with
frosted
glasses
ugh
we
only
went
to
this
place
because
my
gf
and
my
friends
gf
both
wanted
wings
so
maybe
that
took
something
away
from
it
either
way
a
good
beer
the
left
hand
milk
stout
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
less
full
than
dictated
by
the
style
but
in
the
end
i
think
that
just
adds
to
the
beers
overall
drinkability
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
will
certainly
recommend
the
milk
stout
to
all
my
friends
a
great
job
done
by
our
friends
in
colorado
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
i
have
tried
i
highly
recommend
this
stout
d
a
one
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
the
flavors
are
pleasing
and
never
push
the
tastebuds
too
far
my
2nd
milk
stout
was
this
one
bottled
82807
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
w
a
decent
tan
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
a
decent
lacing
nose
is
mainly
toasted
nuts
w
alcoholic
and
darker
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
undertones
faint
buttery
diacetyl
present
as
well
a
rich
toasty
nutlike
malt
flavor
w
some
burnttoast
notes
initially
followed
by
a
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
very
faint
metallic
aftertaste
rich
medbodied
brew
w
a
nice
level
of
co2
lots
of
residual
sweetness
quite
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
having
this
and
other
milks
soon
md
full
bodied
very
subtle
carbonation
feels
nice
on
the
palate
and
tongue
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
very
tasty
and
smooth
low
carbonation
makes
this
brew
a
gem
no
aftertaste
even
for
a
beer
as
dark
as
west
texas
crude
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
why
did
i
buy
just
one
very
dark
cola
color
with
dark
red
highlights
and
a
small
but
creamy
chocolate
milk
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
leaving
patchy
lace
some
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
oats
in
the
nose
along
with
toasted
black
malts
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
some
sweet
cream
as
well
with
light
woodsy
earthy
tealike
hops
in
the
finish
light
in
bodybut
a
touch
crisp
and
sharpthe
mouthfeel
falls
two
steps
short
of
creamy
this
one
aint
bad
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
but
its
nothin
to
write
home
about
neither
d
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
probably
not
seek
it
out
the
flavors
were
great
but
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
disappointing
d
though
a
little
light
in
color
i
think
the
malt
content
is
without
question
upon
reading
other
reviews
im
assuming
that
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
than
it
is
from
the
bottle
something
to
keep
in
mind
its
a
great
blend
of
texture
and
flavor
and
perhaps
slightly
more
drinkable
than
other
stouts
that
scored
higher
in
a
s
t
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
but
its
not
terribly
exciting
meh
drinkability
highly
recommended
for
any
fan
of
milksweet
stouts
since
it
delivers
all
of
the
styles
characteristics
to
your
tounge
palate
and
throat
in
a
great
and
prominent
manner
drinkability
may
be
where
this
one
falls
down
a
bit
for
me
i
love
this
beer
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
several
of
a
bit
more
bitter
roast
coming
through
would
probably
help
pours
a
creamy
blackdark
brown
liquid
a
nice
light
beige
head
sticks
with
the
beer
the
aroma
is
a
creamy
sweet
milky
malt
like
malted
milk
balls
sort
of
the
taste
is
at
first
a
malty
sweet
milk
then
a
more
milky
chocolate
with
a
pure
chocolate
with
only
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
body
was
heavy
but
still
very
drinkable
no
thick
very
sessionable
this
is
definitely
one
ill
go
back
to
one
of
the
best
sweetmilk
stouts
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
d
im
giving
the
beer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
raising
my
scores
a
bit
to
adjust
for
the
possibility
of
a
tainted
bottle
regretfully
this
was
the
last
single
on
the
shelf
when
i
mixed
up
the
sixer
hopefully
i
can
get
this
in
the
future
and
adjust
my
review
accordingly
it
does
have
some
good
coffee
undertones
and
some
caramel
toward
the
end
overall
rating
is
that
this
is
a
good
brew
to
buy
if
youve
never
had
it
just
to
get
it
under
your
belt
very
drinkable
could
have
many
of
these
until
they
start
to
hit
the
head
was
very
drinkable
and
will
drink
the
second
one
following
this
review
milk
stouts
are
by
nature
very
drinkable
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
outstandingly
easy
to
drink
probably
could
give
this
to
kids
and
they
would
like
it
pours
very
dark
with
a
smaller
off
white
head
and
average
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
a
good
whiff
of
coco
and
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
has
a
big
hit
of
milk
chocolate
and
light
espresso
tails
off
into
some
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
grains
sticking
out
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
feeling
a
bit
thick
in
my
mouth
but
going
down
like
a
much
lighter
brew
the
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
lightness
presented
my
first
beer
from
left
hand
and
my
first
milk
stout
i
am
happy
with
both
d
my
first
milk
stout
a
descent
beer
but
i
prefer
my
stout
with
more
bitterness
from
a
12oz
bottle
that
i
copped
for
about
1
69
this
spectacular
brew
from
the
left
hand
company
was
simply
outrageous
this
was
perhaps
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
ever
sampled
bursting
with
flavor
appearance
was
a
nice
opaque
dark
color
that
poured
a
nice
frothy
head
smell
was
full
of
cocoa
and
espresso
the
taste
was
awesome
a
strong
espresso
coffee
flavor
that
was
resoundingly
profound
even
after
a
couple
of
brews
the
flavor
is
a
strong
rich
mocha
coffee
flavor
with
a
robust
espresso
taste
that
was
very
noticeable
a
delicious
brew
that
was
easily
drinkable
and
had
a
great
mouthfeel
will
certainly
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
recommended
my
second
favorite
beverage
from
left
handthe
blackjack
porter
being
the
first
this
is
an
exceptional
milk
stoutboth
flavourful
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoy
this
with
a
punch
cigar
whenever
i
get
the
chanceand
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
stouts
flavor
presents
a
fine
brew
of
dark
malts
and
milk
sugars
the
latter
of
which
takes
the
edge
off
the
grain
bill
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
good
this
one
is
very
balanced
which
makes
for
a
very
approachable
milk
stout
if
you
want
a
good
session
stout
this
might
be
the
right
choice
poured
a
dark
rich
color
with
very
little
head
but
that
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
taco
mac
it
was
very
creamy
and
full
bodied
i
could
sense
the
milk
sugars
in
there
not
an
overly
complex
flavour
however
and
about
midway
through
it
became
old
and
redundant
maybe
it
would
help
to
eat
at
the
same
time
mix
things
up
a
bit
drinkability
very
easy
drinker
wish
we
had
left
hand
out
on
the
west
coast
heck
i
wish
we
had
any
milk
stout
this
good
on
the
west
coast
buy
a
4
pack
and
not
just
a
single
d
i
think
the
best
stout
i
have
had
so
far
very
flavoursome
but
a
abv
that
is
still
in
the
sessionable
region
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
this
is
a
great
stout
that
you
can
drink
a
couple
and
enjoy
each
one
more
than
the
last
this
just
happened
to
be
in
a
recent
sixer
of
polestar
pilsner
i
purchased
been
meaning
to
give
it
a
try
for
a
while
so
this
was
quite
propitious
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
with
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
dark
chocolate
burnt
wood
and
some
slight
caramel
sweetness
coming
through
taste
is
very
complex
with
some
sugary
syrup
roasted
almonds
malts
creamy
milkiness
and
chocolate
at
the
forefront
and
some
toffee
in
the
background
thick
and
somewhere
between
medium
and
fullbodied
with
none
of
that
watered
down
feel
some
stouts
and
porters
can
tend
to
give
you
this
is
a
fullon
surprise
of
a
beer
and
one
of
my
new
faves
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easy
a
little
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
nice
stout
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
until
i
get
too
full
and
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
ive
had
this
will
definitely
be
stocked
in
my
fridge
perfect
beer
for
an
after
dinner
treat
especially
during
the
holidays
a
great
converstation
warmer
too
note
every
thing
i
have
tasted
by
left
hand
has
been
exceptional
i
love
the
brewery
as
my
top
5
eidt
i
take
it
back
after
drinking
it
some
more
i
am
definately
getting
that
sweetness
very
well
done
left
hand
i
thought
is
was
a
very
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
overall
impression
this
is
definitely
what
a
milk
stout
should
be
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
left
hand
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
overall
a
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
its
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
pretty
good
it
has
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
and
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
not
the
greatest
stout
in
the
world
but
is
a
real
nice
drinker
d
def
hard
to
stop
at
one
and
stout
i
enjoy
oh
wait
smooth
poured
into
an
american
pint
black
and
opaque
in
appearance
12
inch
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
barely
a
thin
skim
thin
consistent
lacing
throughout
the
tasting
scent
of
sour
milk
malt
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
but
there
was
a
subtle
creaminess
as
well
very
little
carbonation
more
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
malt
and
toffee
not
a
bad
session
stout
this
beer
makes
for
an
excellent
session
the
malt
is
featured
in
the
taste
chocolate
and
espresso
with
a
sweet
kick
leaves
a
burnt
coffee
aftertaste
i
expected
a
beer
with
more
body
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
slightly
flat
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
will
be
returning
to
anytime
soon
the
abv
is
low
so
it
wont
hurt
you
if
this
is
just
one
of
many
in
session
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
translucent
black
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
laces
well
the
smell
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweetness
and
heavy
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
fizzy
and
slightly
light
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
the
best
d
this
is
well
above
average
beer
that
is
great
for
dessert
but
it
is
too
sweet
to
drink
all
day
or
night
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
too
rich
to
drink
more
then
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
would
like
to
try
it
with
some
different
desserts
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
really
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
like
it
prosit
mk
12
oz
brown
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
bottled
92707
beer
poured
with
fairly
thin
head
yet
remained
to
the
end
with
light
lacing
sweet
coffee
smell
that
reminded
me
of
some
candy
my
mother
used
to
eat
did
not
taste
as
sweet
as
i
expected
almost
a
little
thin
but
a
nice
coffeesmoke
profile
with
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
i
would
surely
have
another
the
more
i
sip
on
this
stout
the
more
it
starts
to
taste
like
im
drinking
smoke
flavored
chocolate
milk
i
almost
forgot
at
the
end
that
i
had
been
drinking
stout
and
not
porter
yet
that
was
because
of
the
prominent
flavors
and
the
rich
texture
milk
stout
is
a
good
find
and
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
probably
my
new
sweet
stout
of
choice
live
in
durango
now
and
ska
makes
a
good
one
too
but
have
to
give
edge
to
left
hand
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
silky
freaking
easy
drinking
stout
well
done
i
liked
this
a
lot
in
bottles
but
it
moves
even
higher
on
draft
does
this
brewery
make
a
bad
beer
d
nice
all
the
way
around
very
rich
though
so
drinking
more
that
a
couple
would
be
asking
quite
alot
nice
overall
this
beer
was
very
strange
to
me
i
have
never
had
a
milk
stout
before
ths
one
tasted
pretty
good
although
i
could
not
get
over
the
milk
taste
it
was
like
someone
poured
a
beer
into
my
milk
all
and
all
this
one
i
will
probably
have
again
and
i
am
very
intrested
in
trying
a
milk
stout
again
a
pleasant
and
inviting
beer
initially
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
cocoa
then
a
slight
fruit
wafts
through
the
top
of
my
mouth
the
head
is
quick
to
disapate
and
only
slightly
clings
to
the
glass
taste
is
traditional
milk
stout
only
with
slightly
less
creaminess
than
you
might
expect
nice
malt
roundness
then
cocoa
coffee
and
iced
tea
fruitiness
the
hops
are
delicate
and
just
enough
to
keep
this
from
being
much
to
sweet
this
is
as
drinkable
as
beer
gets
for
me
despite
the
heavy
stout
label
i
often
drink
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
football
game
without
tiring
of
it
at
all
readily
available
to
me
in
my
area
my
beer
fridge
is
never
without
a
stock
of
this
one
thank
you
left
hand
poured
a
dark
brown
with
about
1
inch
of
tan
head
all
in
all
i
was
unimpressed
with
this
beer
especially
coming
from
the
imaginative
people
at
left
hand
the
beer
had
a
pretty
sweet
nose
to
it
but
that
was
the
most
prevalent
quality
of
the
beer
the
front
was
sweet
and
creamy
but
the
flavor
just
died
out
all
the
taste
was
up
front
i
just
didnt
think
that
there
was
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
a
typical
appearance
of
a
stout
nice
and
dark
with
lots
of
depth
its
smell
had
a
faint
dairy
aroma
but
it
was
more
malty
than
milky
however
its
taste
and
mouthfeel
lived
up
to
its
name
the
drink
was
pretty
creamy
but
personally
i
thought
it
had
a
light
structure
comparatively
it
also
had
a
moderately
crisp
aftertaste
overall
i
think
i
would
have
wanted
something
heavier
though
to
many
this
would
be
a
heavy
enough
drink
i
would
recommend
this
as
one
of
the
more
accessible
milk
stouts
if
you
like
this
id
also
suggest
trying
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
which
i
found
to
be
a
better
beer
but
up
against
the
blackout
this
is
like
drinking
a
chocolate
milkshake
the
sweet
is
noticeable
on
the
nose
right
away
and
the
beer
follows
through
on
that
promise
its
thick
sweet
and
luscious
full
of
chocolate
and
dairy
which
is
a
little
redundant
but
true
tasted
strongly
of
roasted
malt
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
the
roasted
malt
was
the
dominant
flavor
in
this
as
well
as
the
extra
sweetness
due
to
the
milk
sugars
used
to
make
it
a
milk
stout
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
dark
heavy
porter
rather
than
a
stout
sort
of
a
stout
on
training
wheels
this
would
be
a
good
beginner
stout
for
those
who
are
new
to
darker
beer
styles
or
think
they
do
not
like
stouts
its
good
but
a
couple
at
a
time
is
enough
sweetness
would
be
good
for
after
dinner
desert
poured
an
attractive
dark
color
with
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
was
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
was
also
of
chocolate
coffee
and
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
nice
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
maybe
not
the
most
complex
but
very
enjoyable
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
very
enjoyable
and
great
session
beer
d
could
drink
this
daily
in
place
of
anything
sweet
or
a
late
night
toddy
this
would
be
great
to
show
those
resistant
to
dark
beers
that
they
are
good
and
harmless
i
recommend
d
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
very
wellcrafted
and
tasty
i
could
enjoy
these
for
a
long
time
i
really
like
left
hands
imperial
stout
as
it
was
really
unique
for
its
genre
this
brew
does
the
stoutmilk
stout
category
very
well
and
plays
by
all
the
rules
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
long
its
delicately
and
subtlely
smooth
and
not
too
much
lactose
was
used
by
the
feel
of
it
very
good
in
respects
to
the
genre
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
really
smooth
and
creamy
it
truely
almost
tastes
as
if
you
were
drinking
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
a
draft
house
near
my
home
the
main
reason
i
tried
it
was
because
it
was
on
special
for
2
50
i
was
instantly
hooked
and
go
at
least
once
a
week
now
the
beer
pours
dark
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
has
a
chocolaty
is
that
a
word
milk
hint
not
something
i
could
sit
back
and
pound
but
great
with
a
meal
d
this
is
very
good
and
a
classic
example
of
a
milk
stout
i
find
it
very
drinkable
my
first
brew
from
left
hand
and
i
am
looking
foreward
to
trying
others
well
done
not
a
very
appealing
beer
closer
to
a
guinness
than
a
milk
stout
d
very
drinkable
provided
youre
in
the
mood
for
dessert
my
dessert
tonight
disappeared
in
about
15th
the
time
i
normally
spend
on
a
beer
chocolate
fans
should
not
miss
this
one
pours
opaque
but
is
reddishbrown
around
the
edges
initially
head
was
tall
and
light
brown
it
did
drop
down
but
lacing
was
excellent
smells
of
coffee
and
earth
as
well
as
some
chocolate
taste
also
comes
off
as
a
coffeechocolate
mix
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
but
i
didnt
find
it
too
sweet
with
hops
rolling
in
toward
the
finish
and
aftertaste
after
a
few
sips
i
also
caught
some
roasted
malt
and
smokeiness
what
really
sticks
around
in
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
mild
resin
quality
wo
too
much
bitterness
mouthful
was
quite
nice
rich
and
creamy
wo
being
thick
and
enough
carbonation
to
balance
everything
else
out
like
the
sweetness
i
didnt
find
this
too
high
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
on
a
cooling
dry
preautumn
afternoon
a
great
warmer
and
nice
taste
reminder
of
fall
weather
dark
black
with
redbrown
at
the
edge
and
a
creamy
foamy
head
the
first
whiff
is
like
chocolate
milk
this
is
good
because
i
consider
myself
a
chocolate
milk
connoisseur
the
taste
follows
suit
and
is
creamy
milky
some
chocolate
excellent
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
which
is
the
first
milk
stout
i
actually
really
enjoyed
drinkability
was
good
for
the
one
pint
i
had
but
i
could
not
see
drinking
one
more
a
bomber
would
be
perfect
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
brown
hues
the
head
is
large
and
tannishwhite
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
cream
nuts
and
roasted
malt
the
is
like
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
intense
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
for
a
milk
stout
and
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
too
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
again
drinkability
the
last
beer
i
that
is
available
in
nebraska
i
think
although
i
did
see
a
brewery
mixed
12
pack
with
deep
cover
in
it
a
very
good
beer
of
which
i
see
few
of
this
style
i
may
opt
for
this
one
again
pours
th
darkest
of
brownswith
a
ruby
hue
when
held
to
light
thin
tan
head
not
much
retentionand
good
lacing
aroma
is

chocolate
body
is
mediumwith
a
bit
of
carbionation
taste
is
of
coffeeand
creamy
chocolate
good
from
start
to
finish
d
i
could
ceretainly
put
more
than
one
of
these
away
in
a
sitting
and
will
revisit
this
one
soon
drinkability
not
my
favorite
sweet
beer
but
pretty
damn
good
i
bought
a
couple
of
them
to
give
a
good
review
and
i
will
gladly
finish
them
all
off
grab
one
if
you
can
d
this
is
a
great
highly
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
excelent
and
the
body
is
thick
and
rich
as
it
shold
be
the
almost
surprisingly
high
level
of
carbonation
really
adds
to
the
character
of
the
beer
by
preventing
the
flavors
from
becoming
oppressive
and
it
especially
aids
the
drinkability
the
aroma
would
be
the
only
disapointment
for
me
as
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
there
brew
pours
a
lighter
shade
of
black
if
thats
possible
aromas
were
strong
with
roasted
malts
big
coffee
presence
there
is
a
slightly
astringent
roasted
flavor
in
there
not
pleasing
to
the
palate
almost
unrefined
but
it
still
drinkable
interesting
soft
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
some
cool
hops
added
to
round
out
the
flavor
not
that
great
this
one
needs
some
work
taste
is
full
of
earthy
roasted
notes
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
there
is
even
some
cacao
which
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
little
dusty
or
grainy
there
is
probably
some
adjunct
in
here
in
the
form
of
raw
barley
because
there
is
an
oily
taste
and
mouthfeel
in
here
body
is
sweet
and
a
little
sticky
and
drinkability
is
good
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
just
shy
of
opaque
with
a
reddish
tint
the
aroma
is
toasty
and
coffeelike
with
some
vanilla
and
woody
characteristics
taste
is
like
coffee
bitterness
with
a
roasty
finish
its
medium
bodied
and
pretty
creamy
but
was
very
carbonated
which
made
it
difficult
to
enjoy
right
away
after
the
beer
sat
for
a
few
minutes
and
warmed
a
little
i
found
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
much
more
having
very
little
experience
in
stouts
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
the
appearance
was
lovely
dark
dark
nearly
jet
black
with
a
nice
deep
roasty
toasty
aroma
taste
was
not
as
overwhelming
as
i
would
have
expected
but
that
was
very
nice
felt
like
i
was
drinking
iced
coffee
but
without
the
coffee
bitterness
flavor
became
even
more
pronouced
when
paired
with
chocolate
nice
job
lets
all
hail
sachin
patel
as
the
god
of
beer
supply
in
athens
ga
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
the
chocolate
sweetness
is
very
good
drinkability
these
can
be
enjoyed
by
a
wide
variety
of
people
nothing
offensive
not
extreme
just
a
good
solid
milk
stout
i
would
have
this
again
mi
probably
wont
specifically
seek
this
out
but
ill
never
turn
one
down
not
that
much
different
than
the
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
i
drink
the
flavor
balances
the
chocolate
malt
with
black
coffee
and
sugary
lactic
sweetness
a
touch
of
pine
hop
in
the
finish
body
is
somewhat
watery
limp
and
with
little
carbonation
very
simple
but
pleasant
as
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
low
levels
of
carbonation
are
appropriate
for
this
beer
and
this
beer
exhibits
them
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
say
ill
buy
it
again
though
id
like
to
explore
what
other
breweries
have
to
offer
in
this
style
i
still
favor
bells
kalamazoo
over
this
one
overall
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
that
ive
had
i
love
milk
stouts
and
would
rate
this
one
of
the
better
bottled
versions
ive
had
lacking
the
freshness
i
crave
from
draft
stouts
yet
still
silky
smooth
and
imminently
drinkable
smooth
and
relatively
fullbodied
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
d
extremely
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
quite
extrodanary
for
a
stout
and
now
that
these
are
available
in
ne
i
will
be
having
a
few
more
sixers
great
tasting
beer
my
first
milk
stout
and
it
didnt
disappoint
its
lightbodied
for
a
stout
with
good
carbonation
the
brew
starts
off
like
dry
dark
chocolate
then
moves
into
a
creamy
still
chocolatey
middle
then
finish
on
a
dryhopped
woody
slightly
nutty
finale
very
drinkable
pretty
complex
stout
solid
overall
proof
that
americans
can
make
a
good
stout
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
overall
good
stout
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
roastiness
and
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
that
leaves
terrific
lacing
behind
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
at
the
beginning
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
roast
flavor
and
finishes
with
some
bitterness
it
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
leaves
you
with
just
enough
flavor
to
take
another
sip
for
that
delicious
flavor
if
you
like
any
kind
of
stout
this
one
is
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
little
pricey
but
that
is
usually
true
of
all
good
beers
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
essentially
black
and
pretty
opaque
large
tan
head
faded
very
slowly
to
reveal
a
thick
layer
of
lace
that
lasted
till
the
bitter
end
smell
was
alot
of
chocolate
to
say
the
least
huge
lactose
mile
profile
but
bigtime
light
chocolate
aroma
the
flvor
picked
right
up
where
that
left
off
very
smooth
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
but
really
very
nice
this
was
more
of
a
chocolate
stout
then
a
milk
stout
to
me
but
the
sweetness
is
very
prevelent
low
abv
makes
this
totally
a
session
beer
overall
very
nice
and
highly
recommeded
for
a
try
really
redeemed
left
habd
for
me
after
the
smoke
jumper
this
is
an
excellent
tasting
sweet
stout
if
only
because
the
flavors
are
so
balanced
there
is
a
nice
creamy
roasted
nut
flavor
followed
by
coffee
beans
and
eventually
sweet
milk
the
finish
is
ever
so
slightly
bitter
from
a
sturdy
hop
bill
that
stays
in
the
background
the
one
thing
that
bring
this
beer
down
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
too
thin
and
watery
id
like
a
little
more
or
a
full
and
creamy
mouth
with
this
type
of
beer
and
its
the
one
area
this
one
is
lacking
in
still
this
is
a
very
good
sweet
stout
drinkability
enjoyed
this
real
nice
on
tap
would
buy
another
one
thanks
to
bitterbill
for
including
this
one
in
our
trade
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
a
white
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
bitter
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
i
expect
from
a
milk
stout
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
sweetness
still
this
is
nicely
bitterroasted
for
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
style
creamy
mouth
coating
but
not
too
think
or
cloying
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
not
a
bad
brew
to
drink
once
in
a
while
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
i
decent
change
of
pace
brew
that
id
drink
when
i
dont
feel
like
getting
pieeyed
a
good
example
of
the
style
also
likely
to
be
a
decent
choice
for
those
looking
to
get
into
stouts
and
porters
as
the
milky
sweetness
really
does
a
great
job
of
mellowing
the
roastiness
of
this
stout
plenty
of
flavour
abounds
however
for
those
acclimatized
to
the
bitter
roasted
flavours
of
the
roasted
barley
or
malt
certainly
sessionable
and
one
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
again
drinkability
only
my
second
beer
from
left
hand
but
another
great
one
this
is
a
nice
and
full
flavored
stout
without
having
an
abv
that
will
knock
you
on
your
rear
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
most
places
that
carry
this
would
probably
have
mackesons
and
thats
probably
the
way
id
go
but
this
was
definately
an
above
average
beer
bottom
line
this
is
just
an
average
example
of
the
style
and
though
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
bother
seeking
it
out
again
this
is
a
great
brew
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
with
a
lot
of
potential
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
ruby
hue
the
head
was
tan
colored
and
thick
with
tight
bubbles

some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
caramel
the
taste
is
roasted
and
chocolaty
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
this
is
a
nice
smooth
beer
that
id
consider
quite
drinkable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
amazing
pitch
black
with
a
fluffy
foamy
creamy
head
that
leaves
some
serious
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
corn
and
roasted
malt
and
barley
taste
for
some
reason
all
left
hand
brews
to
me
taste
like
cream
corn
has
that
cream
corn
base
with
some
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
a
coffee
aftertaste
this
brew
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
was
a
bit
enjoyable
mouth
is
an
chaotic
combination
of
just
short
of
harsh
and
awesome
creaminess
id
like
to
see
what
this
beer
is
like
after
a
few
tweaks
but
overall
i
cant
complain
this
beer
falls
short
of
greatness
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
im
sure
ill
get
it
again
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
pours
an
off
brownblack
with
a
tan
head
smells
like
cardboard
bread
and
sake
tastes
like
roasted
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
but
not
very
bitter
has
a
nice
balanced
sweetness
about
it
mouthfeel
is
very
luxurious
and
pleasant
could
drink
this
stout
all
night
long
opinion
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
has
a
drinkable
balance
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
it
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
be
really
objective
there
are
no
flaws
and
the
balance
is
not
swayed
too
hard
to
the
sweetness
or
the
roast
so
that
is
a
good
thing
i
am
not
sure
what
circumstances
would
necessitate
that
i
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
would
i
would
take
any
number
of
beers
over
this
one
but
that
is
only
because
of
style
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
this
style
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
me
but
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
the
apperance
is
a
pale
black
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
lacing
cascades
on
the
glass
nicely
but
dissapates
very
quickly
the
smell
of
maltballs
and
fresh
milk
the
taste
is
creamy
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
cotes
your
tongue
for
days
the
drinkability
is
less
appealling
for
me
being
lactose
intolerate
dissapointing
appearance
for
a
stout
poured
about
a
half
inch
head
that
reduced
to
almost
nothing
small
spotty
traces
of
lacing
saved
it
from
a
2
5
the
color
is
a
solid
black
very
appealing
aroma
with
alot
going
on
hints
of
mocha
coffee
roasted
grains
sweet
malts
and
hops
im
happy
with
the
5
2
abv
i
do
not
like
my
stouts
to
high
in
alcohol
it
could
use
more
body
being
that
it
is
a
bit
watery
has
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
along
with
a
spicey
hop
flavor
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
can
see
myself
finishing
the
whole
sixpack
has
a
dry
bitter
lingering
coffeelike
finish
it
is
not
overly
sweet
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
doesnt
match
that
of
the
taste
though
overall
a
great
drinkable
stout
worthy
of
a
try
thanks
to
the
wife
for
picking
it
out
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
greater
access
to
bottle
courtesy
of
shp555
poured
a
medium
black
color
stout
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
light
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
coffee
malt
with
a
good
lactose
feel
also
noticeable
the
creamy
texture
was
very
interesting
with
a
nice
full
body
i
thought
this
beer
was
well
balance
between
roasted
coffee
malt
and
the
creamy
lactose
aspect
of
it
im
not
planning
on
having
this
again
its
not
bad
but
there
are
too
many
other
great
beers
in
our
wonderful
world
to
spend
much
time
with
this
one
when
i
first
had
this
i
was
blown
away
then
in
a
later
bottle
i
was
disappointed
so
it
may
vary
from
bottle
to
bottle
its
a
great
milk
stout
though
it
can
taste
a
lot
like
chocolate
milk
sweeter
and
thicker
than
most
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
i
pours
out
a
deep
brownblack
with
a
think
brownishtan
and
foamy
head
some
lacing
the
smell
is
strongly
of
chocolate
malts
the
front
taste
is
mostly
of
malt
but
then
you
hit
that
sweet
chocolate
taste
and
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
good
stuff
itll
get
you
hooked
on
stouts
taste
unfortunattely
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
mark
it
has
the
roasted
flavors
but
not
a
whole
lot
else
mouthfeel
is
nicely
creamy
and
not
too
carbonated
but
otherwise
somewhat
weak
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
porter
than
a
true
milk
stout
could
be
better
could
be
worse
this
one
got
my
hopes
up
and
then
dashed
them
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
and
probably
will
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
with
medium
carbonation
pours
a
nice
clean
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
kinda
sweet
of
malts
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
and
lots
of
toffeecaramel
overtones
medium
body
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
very
enjoyable
to
drink
recommended
one
word
of
caution
though
is
that
i
find
a
huge
amount
of
variability
in
this
beer
this
is
my
second
six
pack
of
the
beer
and
i
find
that
different
bottles
even
from
the
same
six
pack
taste
different
the
first
bottle
tasted
great
the
second
was
pretty
bad
and
the
next
bottle
tasted
pretty
god
again
no
consistency
from
bottle
to
bottle
i
remember
last
years
vintage
of
this
being
pretty
terrible
but
overall
this
year
is
pretty
good
its
a
decent
buy
at
only
7
29
a
six
pack
but
dont
expect
every
bottle
to
be
stellar
for
this
reason
my
scores
dropped
a
bit
mmmmouthfeel
thick
and
heavy
and
real
smooth
it
had
little
bursts
of
carbonation
and
it
flowed
nicely
to
back
of
the
throat
the
first
taste
was
real
soft
with
roasted
malts
coffee
and
caramel
it
fades
real
nice
and
becomes
almost
sweet
with
toffee
chocolate
and
burnt
toast
give
it
up
for
colorado
brewers
and
left
hand
for
this
creation
d
this
is
actualy
a
fairly
easy
brew
to
drink
i
think
it
is
a
beer
for
people
who
want
something
different
this
beer
is
a
change
of
pace
for
those
who
want
some
thing
dark
with
not
alot
of
bitterness
and
not
really
heavy
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
once
in
awhile
but
not
my
favorite
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brownish
black
with
two
fingers
of
cream
fluffy
caramel
colored
head
smells
of
malted
milk
balls
vanilla
and
cocoa
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
stout
drinks
very
easy
im
glad
i
have
access
to
this
whenever
a
craving
comes
around
recommended
drinkability
nearly
a
sessionable
stout
minus
the
sweetness
from
the
style
highly
recommended
da
i
really
dig
this
style
easy
to
drink
and
nutricious
highly
recommended
dtoo
sweet
for
me
no
more
than
one
this
one
could
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
is
quite
enjoyable
overall
cheers
drinkability
goes
down
nice
could
do
two
in
a
night
finishes
sweet
with
the
slightest
hint
of
dryness
very
middle
of
the
road
beer
very
enjoyable
but
nothing
exciting
poured
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
tracings
on
the
glass
the
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
were
good
the
first
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
this
flavor
is
the
first
flavor
you
taste
the
flavors
are
of
coffee
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
smoke
the
lactosesugar
is
not
obvious
as
a
taste
but
there
is
an
overall
sweetness
overall
a
very
nice
and
highly
sessionable
milk
stout
i
believe
this
to
be
an
under
represented
style
among
craft
brewers
tasty
particularly
a
it
warms
the
flavors
are
presented
in
a
well
arranged
fashion
and
meld
together
nicely
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
this
is
an
easy
stout
to
consume
flavorful
and
light
with
a
great
longlasting
aftertaste
overall
this
to
me
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
some
large
and
subtle
flavors
it
is
not
overwhelming
yet
has
a
strong
milk
chocolate
feel
almost
milkshake
like
cheers
to
this
one
i
am
unimpressed
with
this
milk
stout

the
flavors
are
not
bold
enough
and
dont
live
up
to
the
style
standards
this
brew
is
not
bad
it
just
is
not
great
not
what
id
call
udderly
delightful

more
casually
very
drinkable
i
served
this
from
a
12oz
bottle
that
was
bottled
2
5
months
prior
to
drinking
according
to
the
label
it
pours
very
dark
but
not
black
like
some
other
stouts
i
poured
from
a
bit
above
the
bottle
and
got
a
thick
tan
head
about
1
25
inches
thick
that
went
away
in
less
than
a
minute
the
beer
was
a
little
too
cold
but
there
was
a
slight
roasted
aroma
there
is
a
prominent
lactose
flavor
that
i
remember
from
a
cream
stout
i
brewed
once
that
quickly
fades
into
a
roasted
flavor
the
sweetness
of
the
lactose
is
a
tad
much
for
me
but
it
is
enjoyable
none
the
less
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
it
is
initially
very
full
but
quickly
fades
to
a
much
thinner
feel
i
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
around
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
brewed
on
date
on
front
label
color
was
black
with
a
tannish
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
head
and
lacing
smell
was
a
little
off
on
this
sample
compared
to
prior
tastings
but
it
usually
heavy
on
coffee
roasted
malt
and
some
sweetness
solid
mouthfeel
that
was
a
little
creamy
really
enjoyed
the
taste
on
this
one
it
might
not
be
as
strong
as
some
other
milk
stouts
but
thats
fine
by
me
this
one
hits
the
spot
another
excellent
left
hand
beer
that
will
find
a
home
in
my
regular
rotation
highly
recommend
4
rr
ty
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
black
with
a
14
inch
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strong
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
imo
what
a
stout
should
be
the
taste
is
roasted
coffee
with
a
light
milk
chocolate
aftertaste
for
a
stout
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
which
i
have
before
a
very
nice
offering
from
left
hand
everything
a
milk
stout
should
be
not
the
cheapest
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
not
a
session
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
amber
hue
not
pitch
black
like
some
other
stouts
that
i
really
enjoy
the
light
brown
head
made
a
brief
appearance
but
quickly
subsided
leaving
not
a
trace
of
sticky
goodness
on
the
glass
this
beer
is
not
very
complex
its
sweet
alright
but
somewhat
thin
and
watery
and
not
very
aromatic
i
dont
think
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
oily
black
with
very
little
tanish
brown
head
very
little
lace
was
left
on
the
glass
upon
closer
inspection
the
beer
was
actually
a
redish
brown
color
smelled
of
smoke
molasses
and
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
sweet
sugary
molasses
taste
upfront
with
a
bitter
roasted
coffee
finish
with
small
bursts
of
alcohol
had
a
thick
chewy
feel
in
the
mouth
which
was
nice
was
pretty
drinkable
i
have
to
give
this
one
another
shot
dark
chocolate
bitterness
reigns
over
the
palate
accented
by
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
what
i
assume
is
lactose
my
lips
are
sticky
this
stout
is
rather
good
in
my
opinion
i
feel
like
i
could
have
it
with
cookies
or
brownies
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
easily
go
through
three
or
four
of
not
at
all
bad
but
not
as
good
as
mackesons
triple
xxx
stout
drinkability
with
the
strong
coffee
flavors
this
is
more
of
a
porter
heavy
stuff
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
highly
enjoyable
drinking
experience
not
quite
as
big
or
tasty
as
mackesons
but
this
harkens
back
to
the
old
watneys
cream
stout
i
loved
so
much
about
10
years
ago
but
havent
seen
in
the
us
in
many
years
had
this
on
tap
last
evening
it
poured
to
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
but
i
feel
that
there
are
better
options
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
aroma
as
it
had
a
chocolate
and
burnroasted
malt
flavor
left
a
slight
chard
aftertaste
also
was
able
to
pick
up
some
coffee
undertones
as
well
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
brew
feel
that
i
have
others
that
i
would
look
for
before
i
got
this
again
a
very
nice
after
dinner
beer
but
the
sweetness
could
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
enjoyable
beer
nothing
really
to
distinguish
it
from
other
american
milk
stouts
out
there
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
dark
nearly
black
it
had
a
browntanish
head
that
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
nice
lace
that
sticks
around
it
smells
of
burnt
malt
and
a
little
coffee
the
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
some
mocha
that
gets
better
with
every
sip
this
beer
fills
the
mouth
without
being
too
heavy
overall
enjoyable
but
their
are
better
milk
stouts
out
there
an
overall
good
beer
but
a
little
light
on
flavor
and
aroma
give
it
a
try
i
have
to
admit
to
being
a
left
hand
fanboy
but
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
and
highly
reccomend
it
medium
body
and
overall
a
fairly
easy
drinker
this
beer
got
better
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
i
found
myself
wanting
more
but
only
had
one
bottle
id
only
have
a
few
although
inebriation
might
cloud
ones
senses
and
overlook
the
sweetness
just
a
tad
too
rich
for
me
this
is
a
milk
stout
that
could
be
enjoyed
all
night
the
color
is
opugue
black
with
a
tan
frothy
head
that
disappeared
very
fast
it
has
a
light
carbonation
the
roasty
coffee
flavor
with
a
nice
rich
creaminess
is
definately
very
enjoyalbe
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
for
a
long
time
bottle

poured
a
opaque
black
looked
great
little
bit
of
chocolate
brown
frothy
foam
that
quickly
disappeared
no
bubbles
during
drinking
smelt
of
a
slighty
burnt
dark
chocolate
tasted
solid
like
the
same
dark
chocolate
nice
and
thick
it
felt
like
it
was
coating
the
inside
of
my
mouth
left
a
little
aftertaste
maybe
like
coffee
it
was
sublte
and
hard
to
tell
very
easy
to
sip
no
problems
at
all
roasty
coffee
flavors
lightly
sweet
the
sweetness
and
lactose
reveals
itself
slowly
as
it
warms
gets
creamier
and
a
lingering
roasty
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
tasty
stuff
i
love
creammilk
stouts
and
this
one
delivers
what
im
looking
for
a
nice
roastycreamy
balance
another
pretty
good
beer
from
left
hand
but
nothing
amazing
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
reddish
highlights
off
white
head
forms
well
then
falls
into
the
beer
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
the
lack
of
head
retention
is
really
the
only
negative
thing
to
say
about
this
beer
the
aroma
is
a
great
mix
of
sweetness
fruit
and
roasted
malts
in
the
flavor
the
roastiness
is
more
prominant
but
the
sweetness
and
fruits
are
present
and
obvious
the
thick
mouthfeel
thank
you
lactose
is
matched
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
if
not
for
the
ridiculous
amount
of
calories
in
these
i
could
drink
them
all
night
this
is
the
best
milk
stout
ive
had
to
date
i
had
trepidation
about
this
one
due
to
previous
bad
experiences
with
the
lactose
stouts
but
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
my
previous
samplings
of
a
mackesons
stout
a
black
as
pot
of
3
day
old
truckstop
coffee
with
a
moderate
tan
head
with
resilient
lacing
s
the
malts
are
subtle
with
the
sugars
being
very
profound
on
the
nose
t
the
lactose
was
much
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
obviously
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
m
thick
sweet
chocolate
feel
very
viscous
d
this
is
a
drinkable
milk
stout
but
not
a
really
sessionable
for
me
anyway
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
order
it
again
drinkability
i
would
love
to
see
this
on
tap
id
quaff
it
all
night
d
for
a
stout
it
is
very
approachable
not
real
heavy
and
overbearing
on
the
roasty
bits
could
be
a
session
beer
for
some
very
nice
and
shouldnt
be
missed
d
so
tasty
this
is
my
new
favorite
dessertnot
dessert
beer
just
dessert
in
general
sessionable
as
well
do
try
this
one
milky
smooth
chewy
sweetness
full
roasted
coffee
comes
and
finishes
it
off
i
didnt
see
anything
overly
great
about
the
beer
but
the
thre
that
came
in
the
mixer
somehow
just
disappeared
quickly
milk
stouts
are
definitely
superior
to
imperials
on
hot
summer
days
poured
into
my
sam
smith
tulip
the
ale
is
virtually
an
opaque
black
with
slight
ruby
brown
highlishgts
at
the
bottom
where
the
glass
is
the
most
narrow
it
forms
a
beautiful
1
finger
head
that
fizzes
out
quickly
unfortunately
but
still
leaves
slick
foamy
lacing
on
the
glasss
sides
taking
a
huge
whiff
i
inhale
a
thin
but
creamysweet
roatiness
this
smell
is
the
high
point
of
the
beer
upfront
the
taste
is
bittersweet
coffee
which
moves
quickly
to
a
milky
sweetness
ending
in
a
very
roasty
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
pleasant
tingle
of
carbonation
i
feel
that
a
bit
more
thickness
is
in
order
though
as
for
drinkability
its
quite
enjoyable
but
leaves
me
feeling
very
filled
so
that
one
is
all
im
fit
for
poured
to
a
drak
brown
with
hints
of
red
thin
tan
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
was
strongly
malt
chocolate
and
toffee
with
coffee
smell
becoming
more
evident
at
midglass
flavor
pretty
much
follwed
these
same
lines
and
the
finish
was
primarily
the
same
as
i
get
after
finishing
my
morning
coffee
this
beer
is
much
less
sweet
than
i
anticipated
i
have
only
had
one
other
milk
stout
before
snow
plow
and
i
disliked
it
immensly
it
was
far
too
sweet
this
one
has
a
little
better
balance
and
would
make
a
decent
dessert
beer
or
nightcap
this
is
a
great
beer
i
only
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
cannot
attest
to
the
head
or
much
about
the
color
i
loved
the
taste
it
was
very
creamy
and
milky
it
has
actual
lactose
in
it
so
it
is
quite
authentic
and
raw
with
milk
flavor
it
has
a
distinct
coffee
flavor
it
is
a
great
desert
beer
it
is
the
beer
version
of
a
milk
shake
overall
not
an
outstanding
milk
stout
but
falls
short
of
my
expectations
this
beers
pours
black
with
a
tan
to
light
brown
head
thaty
floats
in
my
glass
leaving
nice
sticky
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
sweet
roastslight
coffee
and
maybe
some
brown
sugar
tastes
mostly
of
the
sweet
roasted
malt
and
coffee
followed
by
a
light
bitterness
that
coats
the
mouth
to
a
great
extent
the
moputhfeel
is
almost
drying
to
a
point
but
this
does
not
hinder
the
flavor
of
the
beer
while
pretty
one
dimentional
this
beers
creamy
texture
is
easy
drinkable
especially
as
it
warms
the
alchol
content
is
unhindering
which
makes
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
easy
a
good
representation
of
this
style
that
i
am
loving
more
and
more
as
a
note
the
taste
almost
seems
to
improve
even
more
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
perhaps
i
will
try
it
next
time
not
chilled
i
definately
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
have
really
great
afterdinner
beer
like
i
said
above
dessert
in
a
glass
pours
a
black
clear
body
leaving
a
thick
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
light
sweet
malted
milk
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
fresh
feeling
it
starts
syrupy
sweet
so
nice
and
smooth
followed
by
a
milk
sweetness
with
a
coffee
chocolate
essence
to
round
it
out
it
is
balanced
by
a
nice
spicy
hop
effort
that
really
compliments
this
sweet
stout
the
beer
finishes
again
milky
sweet
this
is
a
session
quality
stout
i
will
be
drinking
this
all
year
around
this
beer
is
quite
a
treat
good
on
tap
but
even
better
in
the
bottle
pours
black
with
slight
browning
around
edges
when
held
up
to
light
raw
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
feels
like
a
gulp
of
skim
milk
and
tastes
full
of
roasted
coffee
and
creamy
chocolate
still
light
enough
with
a
bitter
burnt
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
this
is
the
smoothest
stout
that
i
have
tried
to
date
strong
chocolate
aroma
and
taste
slightly
sweet
but
not
pungent
as
dark
as
100000
mile
diesel
crankcase
oil
do
not
confuse
with
irish
stouts
this
is
smoother
sweeter
and
full
of
complex
layers
of
flavors
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
dark
beers
overall
impression
this
is
defiantly
a
session
beer
can
drink
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
if
you
can
believe
that
i
thought
it
was
a
great
stout
defiantly
crafted
for
those
who
turn
their
heads
at
dark
beers
smooth
easy
drinking
session
beer
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
style
poured
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
head
more
like
nice
knowin
ya
head
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
smelled
chocolatey
with
some
earthy
tones
ive
noticed
this
with
other
left
hand
beers
the
porter
and
the
imperial
stout
the
taste
was
ok
it
seemed
like
someone
poured
a
packet
of
porter
mix
into
my
milk
this
seems
ok
in
theory
but
the
end
result
was
bitter
sweet
i
wish
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
really
lowered
the
drinkability
for
me
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
evened
things
out
for
better
or
for
worse
i
love
all
bas
not
spot
on
for
style
its
more
like
a
decent
porter
than
anything
else
still
pretty
tasty
deep
brown
color
that
appears
black
in
the
glass
until
closer
inspection

is
fairly
rich

of

along
with
a

of

full
of

and
its
attributes
providing
a
creamy
sweetened
blend
of
enjoyable
flavors
such
as
cocoa
coffee
and
raisins
somewhat
overly
bitter
on
the
finish

still
an
impressive

a

ring

im
concerned
this
beer
may
be
overcarbonated

is
actually
just
a
very
very
dark

mdthick

overcarbonated
very
dark
brown
in

with
medium
carbonation
nice
aromas
of
roasted

nuts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
roasted
malt
flavors
are
balanced
out
by
some
thick
lactic
character
minor
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
are
also
present
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
and
although
it
doesnt
realy
take
any
chances
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
fits
perfectly
within
the
traditional
confines
of
the
style
tasted
very
akin
to
the
blackjack
porter
actually
d
highly
drinkable
this
could
get
one
in
trouble
the
mouthfeel
is
really
wonderful
it
is
creamy
and
has
a
nice
oomph
but
manages
to
escape
opressive
weight
wow
nearly
a
perfect
milk
stout
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
pours
out
to
a
porterlike
brownish
black
with

very
low

use

step
up

5
best
tasting
stouts
ive
ever
had
flavors
of
chocolatey
malts
grain
sweet
molasses
mild
creamy
coffee
sweet
wood
elements
wow
excellent
mouthfeel
was
good
id
be
happier
if
it
were
a
bit
thicker
and
had
more
of
a
chewy
texture
to
it
drinkability
amazing
id
have
this
day
in
and
day
out
so
close
to
being
the
benchmark
for
stouts
its
nearly
got
me
in
tears
so
close
highly
recommended
thanks
to
grynder33
for
the
sample
verdict
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
tasty
but
not
quite
as
bulky
as
i
prefer
instead
of
being
creamy
in
a
good
way
it
tasted
like
some
of
the
usual
stout
flavors
are
washed
out
good
but
not
something
im
likely
to
buy
again
not
bad
poured
alot
lighter
in
colour
than
i
was
expecting
it
would
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
ink
black
but
got
something
more
akin
to
slightly
watered
down
cocacola
head
was
decent
overall
for
the
style
it
looked
pretty
good
the
smell
was
very
inviting
very
sweet
with
lots
of
lactose
and
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
incredible
is
this
a
beer
or
a
yoohoo
chocolate
milk
the
only
downside
to
this
was
that
i
feel
it
is
way
way
too
light
for
the
style
concerning
mouthfeel
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
mackeson
xxx
light
this
would
be
it
everything
else
was
fantastic
but
this
light
of
a
body
in
a
milk
stout
is
a
nogo
because
of
the
richness
in
chocolatey
taste
however
i
could
see
this
being
an
occasional
purchase
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
much
prefer
sam
adams
cream
stout
this
beer
might
be
a
good
choice
as
others
have
mentioned
to
give
to
your
friends
to
introduce
them
to
stouts
d
meh
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
impressive
perhaps
a
good
starter
stout
for
novices
very
enjoyable
beer
would
like
to
do
this
one
again
the
drinkability
of
this
one
will
suffer
for
the
same
reason
mackeson
does
that
is
because
its
so
stout
you
could
probly
drink
one
more
left
hand
than
you
could
mackeson
but
i
wouldnt
try
more
than
three
maybe
four
in
an
evening
not
a
session
beer
but
a
rewarding
experience
for
those
who
want
to
taste
something
you
wont
find
everyday
cheers
left
hand
uf
cheers
this
is
only
the
second
milk
stout
i
have
tried
but
i
would
say
i
would
definitely
be
willing
to
buy
this
beer
again
in
the
future
a
good
drinkable
stout
and
were
always
salivating
at
the
prospect
of
getting
more
variety
in
this
state
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
me
like
this
really
hits
the
style
spot
on
if
you
hadnt
told
me
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
milk
stout
i
think
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
overall
i
loved
it
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
i
could
sit
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
next
too
and
after
tasting
have
a
hard
time
figuring
out
which
one
is
the
actual
chocolate
milk
some
will
shy
away
due
to
the
sweetness
but
i
really
liked
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
im
puzzled
with
this
beer
its
neat
cause
its
different
ill
say
that
but
i
mean
this
guy
totally
didnt
know
what
he
was
talking
about
i
think
course
we
live
in
a
minimal
good
brew
area
for
the
most
part
until
recent
two
months
i
must
say
though
if
you
like
coffee
you
would
probably
like
this
im
not
sure
but
my
guess
is
that
since
it
tastes
like
coffee
quite
a
bit
more
than
most
coffee
hinted
brews
and
this
guy
who
is
a
barista
loved
the
hell
outta
it
id
say
it
would
probably
work
im
going
to
say
im
not
buying
it
again
cause
im
not
paying
10
bucks
for
something
this
ok
im
sure
its
someone
elses
thing
though
drinkability
nice
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
a
very
nice
milk
stout
something
i
would
reccomend
with
dessert
this
would
be
great
with
a
nice
piece
of
chocolate
cake
or
black
forest
cake
i
had
seen
this
beer
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
my
local
store
and
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
whirl
poured
nearly
black
with
some
ruby
hues
showing
up
when
holding
it
up
to
the
light
head
retention
was
about
average
with
a
medium
to
light
white
head
that
faded
quickly
smells
i
picked
up
were
sweet
cream
milk
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
there
was
also
a
bit
of
a
burnt
character
to
the
smell
taste
was
very
much
like
drinking
an
ice
coffee
with
the
chocolate
accent
pulling
through
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
although
this
was
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
then
one
or
two
at
a
time
the
sweet
character
of
this
beer
became
a
bit
too
much
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
milk
stout
style
this
is
a
must
try
if
not
still
worth
a
try
cheers
i
like
a
milk
stout
because
its
easier
to
adjust
to
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
the
5
20
is
not
as
strong
as
some
of
the
stouts
ive
enjoyed
recently
and
it
has
the
warming
and
soothing
power
of
a
morning
or
postdinner
coffee
not
a
lot
of
burnt
notes
or
creamy
thickness
here
but
the
mouthfeel
is
still
wonderful
between
the
way
the
beer
foams
up
and
the
slight
roasting
that
lingers
on
and
on
between
the
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
the
balance
and
the
taste
from
start
to
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
it
was
certainly
worth
the
shot
i
took
on
it
d
great
drinkability
i
will
drink
more
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
half
finger
head
diminished
quickly
to
an
offwhite
ring
of
lacing
smells
sweetly
of
cream
adn
coffee
and
a
natural
nutty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
light
yet
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
starting
sweet
and
finishing
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
like
a
weaker
coffee
this
is
my
first
stout
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
beer
appears
to
be
super
black
from
afar
but
put
it
to
the
light
and
you
are
able
to
detect
a
red
hue
this
was
a
good
size
head
that
gave
a
coffee
like
smell
right
off
the
bat
i
am
thinking
this
is
a
smoked
porter
then
the
taste
leans
toward
a
stout
overall
a
great
beer
and
i
am
upset
i
only
bought
the
single
the
sweetness
and
overall
lightness
make
this
an
easy
drinking
stout
not
bad
as
far
as
milk
stouts
go
dark
chocolate
caramel
with
oats
taste
definitely
some
mild
black
coffee
in
there
too
deep
brown
red
in
color
with
suspended
sediment
vanishing
head
spotty
lacing
thin
nutty
milk
chocolate
malt
aroma
and
sweetened
condensed
milk
faint
coffee
smells
right
could
go
with
a
chocolate
doughnut
near
medium
body
leaves
some
burnt
chocolate
malt
on
the
palate
tapers
off
slowly
carbonation
works
just
right
shaking
out
the
flavors
here
exceeded
expectations
didnt
look
especially
bright
after
finishing
this
one
i
wish
i
had
another
a
lot
of
good
smells
and
tastes
built
in
not
exceptional
but
a
sixer
of
this
is
money
wellspent
notes
this
was
my
first
milk
stout
and
it
has
inspired
me
to
seek
out
more
of
the
style
please
give
this
and
other
milk
stouts
like
this
a
try
mackeson
xxx
is
great
too
kind
of
too
rich
to
be
particularly
drinkable
but
fine
enough
for
a
pint
or
two
if
i
saw
it
again
and
was
in
the
mood
for
a
very
sweet
and
heavy
stout
i
would
not
refrain
from
ordering
a
pint
this
is
an
exemplary
milk
stout
from
left
hand
with
a
good
body
and
flavor
profile
generally
this
may
be
imo
the
best
beer
that
left
hand
makes
good
thing
those
bombers
are
cheap
12
ounce
bottle
left
hands
milk
stout
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
oatmeal
sweet
malty
flavor
with
lots
of
cocoa
and
roasted
coffee
thankfully
it
never
gets
too
sweet
lightly
hopped
finish
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
never
sour
or
astringent
enough
carbonation
to
help
the
sweetness
from
being
cloying
pretty
good
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
the
smooth
creamy
flavor
in
this
beer
over
all
drinkability
is
pretty
above
average
but
nothing
amazing
i
can
think
of
lots
of
other
beers
i
would
rather
have
if
you
havent
tried
it
its
probably
worth
a
try
cheers2beers
a
lovely
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malt
caramelized
sugar
butter
and
condensed
milk
the
taste
is
a
bit
unusual
for
this
style
in
a
bad
way
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
apparent
upfront
with
a
very
dry
bready
aftertaste
that
can
best
be
described
as
chalklike
the
hop
profile
for
this
beer
doesnt
not
compliment
the
malt
character
causing
the
beer
to
be
less
sweet
than
it
can
be
distinct
tartiness
in
the
aftertaste
reduces
this
beers
drinkability
and
overall
enjoyment
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
wean
someone
off
of
guinness
draught
with
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
hearty
recommendation
md
sweet
extractlike
coating
my
mouth
with
a
film
of
sugar
with
each
sip
not
my
pint
of
beer
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
heavy
lace
chocolate
dominates
the
nose
with
notes
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
beans
in
the
background
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
is
present
in
the
finish
texture
is
smooth
and
silky
this
is
an
easydrinking
sweet
stout
when
i
got
this
beer
i
was
told
by
the
shop
clerk
that
it
would
be
the
best
milk
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
i
will
have
to
disagree
but
it
should
not
be
avoided
either
i
really
love
this
beer
it
is
gone
and
i
want
another
and
im
not
even
done
typing
i
didnt
mean
to
guzzle
it
i
usually
spend
an
hour
per
glass
it
was
just
too
good
recommended
this
is
a
fairly
dark
beer
with
little
head
it
has
kind
of
a
soured
milk
taste
that
i
do
not
find
very
appealing
it
smells
a
little
more
sour
than
most
other
stouts
i
have
tried
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
affected
by
this
soured
taste
a
couple
of
my
freinds
tried
this
beer
and
liked
it
so
it
may
just
be
that
i
dont
like
a
milk
stout
i
may
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
unfortunately
almost
no
head
whatsoever
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
dark
malts
with
notes
of
cocoa
and
roastiness
the
taste
consists
of
a
richly
sweet
malt
flavor
with
notes
of
coffee
roast
and
chocolate
this
is
bursting
with
sweetness
from
the
added
sugars
and
oats
this
is
another
great
beer
from
left
hand
drinkability
only
suffers
from
the
fact
that
this
beer
can
seem
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
few
beers
balance
the
roast
as
well
as
whats
found
in
this
traditionally
brewed
milk
stout
it
sure
stands
up
to
its
name
and
stylesake
will
definately
seek
this
one
out
to
drink
again
nice
balance
of
typical
stout
kick
and
sweetness
this
one
pours
blackruby
with
a
real
short
latte
colored
head
that
gave
up
on
me
after
about
a
minute
smells
weak
fainly
of
fruit
rasins
maybe
and
a
slight
chocolatealcohol
combo
the
taste
is
slighly
dry
with
a
noticable
dark
fruit
flavor
rasin
fig
plum
and
sweetness
and
a
weak
milk
chocolate
finish
with
a
touch
of
sourtart
feels
a
bit
fizzy
and
thin
for
a
stout
but
not
overly
carbonated
and
minor
creamy
finish
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
just
doesnt
grab
me
i
can
drink
it
its
just
not
special
medium
body
feels
thicker
due
to
pinpoint
bubbles
and
slick
creamy
texture
ng
drinkability
when
i
want
a
good
stout
one
that
will
be
drinkable
this
one
falls
into
the
average
category
but
for
a
stout
thats
excellent
id
buy
this
over
other
stouts
because
of
the
creaminess
this
is
a
wellbalanced
stout
overall
not
too
sweet
the
lactose
sugar
is
evident
but
blends
well
with
the
roasty
malt
profile
very
drinkable
good
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
mix
of
roasted
barley
and
lactose
sugar
nice
work
by
a
solid
brewery
dark
dark
brown
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
bit
too
roasted
for
the
style
though
there
are
pleasant
notes
of
dark
chocolate
sweet
cocoa
malt
is
the
first
noticible
taste
with
a
lighter
roastiness
than
the
nose
implies
but
sufficient
for
some
balance
hop
presence
is
low
a
faint
plumlike
fruitiness
detectable
in
the
finish
with
some
lingering
sweetness
soft
creamy
texture
and
moderate
to
light
body
decent
example
of
the
style
body
is
very
light
for
a
stout
light
easily
penetrates
the
beer
even
in
a
wide
glass
head
is
almost
not
very
large
just
a
few
wisps
on
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
chocolatey
nice
java
presence
taste
is
a
little
drier
than
i
would
have
expected
still
has
a
nice
chocolate
and
hops
presence
to
it
could
use
a
lot
more
body
as
this
beer
is
fairly
thin
better
than
average
but
not
mind
bogglingly
delicious
or
anything
i
find
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
overall
lack
of
negative
qualities
that
would
keep
me
away
from
the
beer
at
worst
this
is
an
eh
beer
perhaps
a
bit
more
bland
than
i
was
expecting
but
fairly
decent
nonetheless
worth
a
try
if
you
like
milk
stouts
and
perhaps
an
easy
entry
into
normal
stouts
for
people
who
dont
like
bitterness
but
a
mackeson
xxx
or
rogue
chocolate
stout
would
be
more
likely
to
hit
my
palate
than
this
one
i
have
found
myself
going
back
to
the
fridge
and
grabbing
one
after
another
of
the
milk
stout
it
really
grew
on
me
and
whatever
the
reason
is
i
like
drinking
this
on
occasion
drinkability
simple
but
delicious
about
as
close
to
a
session
milk
stout
as
it
gets
pours
a

oh
so
easy
to

thank
god
this
is
a
relatively
low
abv
pairs
well
with
chewy
chips
ahoy
i
could
handle
a
couple
of
these
no
prob
drinkability
is
slippery
and
then
some
a
pretty
darn
nice
milk
stout
in
my
book
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishbrown
small
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
long
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
smokey
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
finishes
a
bit
sweet
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
im
definitely
going
to
have
to
try
this
one
when
my
palate
matures
a
little
22
oz
beer
head
was
quite
lacking
color
is
nice
and
dark
ruby
red
through
a
light
the
aroma
was
nice
not
real
strong
but
some
definite
coffee
grounds
a
little
maltiness
the
flavor
is
definitely
sweet
but
not
to
the
extreme
like
a
mackesons
or
at
least
the
way
i
remember
a
mackesons
you
get
a
little
blend
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
roasted
malt
at
the
end
as
well
to
balance
the
sweetness
i
tend
to
think
of
milk
stouts
as
being
a
little
onedimensional
in
some
ways
since
their
sweetness
is
often
not
as
complex
or
deep
as
say
a
malty
bock
this
one
is
kind
of
in
the
lines
of
that
stereotype
but
its
good
for
its
style
and
a
pleasant
drink
for
sure
yeah
i
really
dont
feel
like
knocking
it
but
true
stout
aficianados
wont
miss
anything
if
they
pass
this
by
tried
this
as
a
part
of
a
flying
saucer
flight
since
this
was
my
last
one
of
the
five
it
had
a
perfect
serving
temperature
not
ink
black
but
close
hints
of
chocolate
hops
caramel
not
too
sure
about
the
milksweetness
a
bit
more
difficult
to
finish
dances
on
the
tongue
one
of
my
more
enjoyable
stouts
nice
to
see
left
hand
back
in
the
twin
cities
its
been
a
while
dark
and
clear
not
quite
opaque
black
that
lets
ruby
highlights
through
at
the
bottom
head
is
a
deep
tan
color
of
two
primary
bubble
sizes
but
ends
up
flat
and
thin
after
half
a
minute
laces
in
incomplete
loops
and
dots
malty
aroma
chocolate
milk
and
a
little
cherry
smooth
mouthfeel
with
lower
carbonation
starts
like
sweet
milk
chocolate
nothing
else
much
to
distract
the
flavor
profile
the
beer
finishes
with
a
more
granular
texture
darker
in
tone
more
mousselike
a
bit
sandy
in
the
back
of
the
throat
meets
the
style
well
drinkable
and
simple
in
impression
an
easygoing
sweet
stout
here
this
stout
poure
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
some
red
near
the
edges
with
tan
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
malty
but
very
light
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
light
sweetness
some
cocoa
flavor
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumfull
body
and
good
carbonation
this
was
a
very
porterlike
stout
to
me
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
tasting
it
lived
up
to
its
style
as
a
sweet
stout
it
tasted
rather
chocolatey
but
a
little
bit
less
so
than
other
beers
of
the
same
style
that
i
have
tasted
there
was
even
a
little
bitterness
to
this
beer
not
much
but
it
was
there
for
a
stout
it
was
mediumbodied
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
though
its
not
quite
as
good
as
other
sweet
stouts
those
blackened
malts
rough
up
the
palate
then
smooth
it
out
with
minerally
ash
and
lighter
roasted
barley
flour
with
a
dropper
squeeze
a
few
drops
of
black
cherry
juice
in
grain
alcohol
on
your
tongue
this
manages
to
be
smooth
not
exactly
creamy
more
like
2
milk
mediummedium
light
body
pours
with
a
thick
black
body
with
a
nice
foamy
nearwhite
head
that
lingered
a
while
aroma
is
very
toasted
malt
with
some
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
overtones
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
the
bitter
bite
of
toasted
malt
again
with
some
nice
mochaish
notes
very
smooth
and
sweet
although
it
seems
a
bit
thin
it
could
use
a
bit
more
body
rather
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
better
bottled
stouts
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
dream
silky
smooth
creamy
sudsy
stuff
it
definitely
goes
down
nicely
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
lots
of
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
not
quite
dark
enough
for
a
stout
for
me
the
one
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
the
nose
is
a
nice
chocolate
nd
creamy
just
not
enough
of
the
creamy
for
my
liking
the
flavor
was
a
nice
creamy
milk
chocolate
there
is
not
as
much
of
the
creamy
marshmellow
that
i
have
had
in
others
of
this
style
but
its
nice
the
feel
was
thick
and
creamy
and
smooth
overall
a
nice
beer
not
as
good
as
their
porter
but
a
nice
beer
all
around
finish
isnt
as
long
as
expected
and
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
worth
a
try
maybe
even
a
good
everyday
stout
in
winter
months
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
ale
appearance
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
tone
with
a
decent
sized
quickly
dwindling
tan
head
leaves
some
uneven
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
a
definite
nose
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
powder
with
some
lactic
acid
notes
with
the
musty
tartness
not
overbearing
at
all
actually
melds
into
the
overall
aroma
nicely
chocolate
chip
cookie
dough
like
in
nature
with
mellow
herbal
low
hop
profile
taste
like
drinking
a
cold
glass
of
chocolate
flavored
milk
in
some
regards
the
creaminess
hits
the
tastes
buds
in
an
unoffensive
and
relatively
pleasant
manner
not
overly
sweet
balanced
with
a
the
grace
of
hops
and
darker
malts
definitely
a
decent
brew
from
left
hand
mouthfeel
creamy
texture
coats
the
palate
carbonation
is
just
a
tad
abrasive
with
each
swallow
not
bad
just
could
be
a
bit
smoother
drinkability
one
brew
that
was
better
then
i
was
assuming
i
wouldnt
like
based
on
prior
experiences
with
cream
stouts
not
bad
yet
not
amazing
this
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
pours
out
a
slightly
translucent
black
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
fluffy
foam
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
but
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
creaminess
but
is
overall
pretty
weak
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
off
coffee
and
a
sweet
cream
with
a
backing
of
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
is
roasted
coffee
not
quite
as
rich
as
a
few
other
milk
stouts
ive
had
this
is
still
tasty
body
is
medium
with
average
feel
to
it
for
the
style
pretty
good
drinkability
its
tasty
but
not
as
much
so
as
others
solid
example
of
the
style
that
is
easy
drinking
but
not
one
that
will
wow
you
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
mahogony
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
nice
frothy
light
brown
head
a
most
definite
chocolate
aroma
with
some
coffee
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
again
chocolate
more
of
a
milk
chocolate
than
a
bittersweet
chocolate
at
the
start
with
a
sharp
coffee
like
finish
overall
seems
much
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
but
who
am
i
to
judge
could
have
been
much
more
rich
and
creamy
but
as
is
it
was
fairly
meh
overall
not
bad
good
to
try
once
in
a
while
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
pours
pitch
black
small
tanish
head
forms
after
a
hard
pour
but
quickly
disappears
the
smell
is
full
of
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
an
indication
of
sweetness
very
light
carbonation
strong
sweetness
from
the
lactose
dark
roasty
chocolately
a
tiny
bit
of
coffee
i
thought
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
but
it
finishes
with
a
nice
gentle
bitterness
through
out
the
entire
palate
with
a
sweet
creaminess
definitely
a
good
beer
but
its
no
mackesons
xxx
a
nice
little
sixer
picked
up
by
one
of
my
housemates
pours
a
light
black
color
with
some
loose
cafe
au
lait
head
that
was
mostly
bubbles
the
nose
was
a
tad
indistinct
it
definitely
had
some
warm
sweet
flavors
of
caramel
and
malts
but
there
was
not
any
overpowering
or
unique
smells
the
taste
was
very
tasty
sweet
maltyness
with
the
caramel
morphing
into
a
more
toffee
like
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
as
a
milk
stout
should
be
the
finish
had
a
more
grainy
dry
stout
like
flavor
which
was
good
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
just
carbonated
enough
good
quality
beer
i
was
glad
i
tried
this
one
definitely
recommended
flavor
and
body
is
thick
and
continues
this
milk
chocolate
feel
with
a
healthy
dose
of
body
and
ovaltine
like
flavors
not
a
bad
looking
stout
by
any
means
but
a
tad
thin
looking
in
terms
of
body
and
head
whilst
near
black
the
body
doesnt
have
the
girth
that
youd
expect
from
a
typical
stout
and
the
head
is
a
bit
too
bubby
instead
of
creamy
the
scent
is
quite
nice
if
a
bit
subtle
you
really
have
to
dig
deep
to
pick
up
the
aromas
at
times
which
include
a
nice
roastedburnt
malt
scent
along
with
some
chocolate
oatmeal
and
a
touch
of
coffee
well
done
i
found
a
nice
balance
in
the
flavour
between
the
roasted
earthiness
of
the
malt
and
the
sweet
chocolate
milk
flavour
which
subtly
sneaks
in
toward
the
finish
but
is
quickly
dashed
away
by
some
more
roasted
flavour
this
is
a
silky
smooth
and
creamy
treat
that
in
my
opinion
seems
to
be
a
bit
underrated
by
most
definitely
worth
a
try
and
then
some
overall
a
disappointment
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
left
hand
product
and
never
this
one
was
surprised
to
see
it
and
yes
its
fresh
ill
finish
the
sixer
but
wont
be
rushing
for
another
a
decent
beverage
a
transition
from
a
soda
pop
or
an
ovaltine
looks
like
coke
with
a
snap

where

dark

with
a
very
slight
finely
bubbled
dark

aroma
is
bittersweet
though
more
sweet
than
bitter
chocolate
underlaid
by
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
starts
off
with
a
smooth
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
develops
into
a
finish
which
is
moderately
bitter
with
a
nice
compliment
between
the
hops
and
roasted
grains
body
throughout
is
smooth
fairly

this
beer
is
sweet
which
is
probably
the
flavor
profile
for
all
milk
stouts
if
sweetness
is
not
cloying
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
from
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark

liquid
with

nice

foamy

that
stayed
for

there
was
a
good
amount
of

on
the
glass
at
the
end
smells
slightly
fruity
and
roasted
almost
smells
like
banana
up

this
beer
has
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
then
you
are
hit
with
sweetness
slight
coffee
flavor
as
well
nice
amount
of
hops
but
not
overwhelming
finish
is
dry
this
seemed
fullbodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
nice
balance
between
the
roasted
malt
and
the
sweetness
i
would
have
this
one
again
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
black
patent
scent
but
not
much
else
it
has
a
rather
dry
aroma
the
taste
is
above
average
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
yet
slightly
sweet
finish
it
is
very
dark
and
hides
the
lactose
addition
its
not
as
sweet
as
other
milk
stouts
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
lacking
in
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
more
it
has
a
one
sided
flavor
and
aroma
and
is
undercarbonated
its
one
and
done
for
me
pours
with
a
twofinger

dark
dark

but
not
quite

as
you
might
expect
from
a
stout
very
thin
head
that
disapates
quickly
in
the
first
whiff
you
can
the
smell
of
the
milky
sugar
smell
youd
expect
along
with
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
surprising
when
they
say
milk
stout
they
mean
it
very
little
taste
up
front
with
a
finish
that
is
like
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
milk
with
not
enough
of
the
coffee
syrup
to
give
it
the
proper
coffee
taste
but
still
carrying
the
sweetness
of
coffee
milk
that
you
might
expect
though
it
does
carry
some
sweetness
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
other
milk
stouts
i
have
tryed
even
after
giving
this
a
few
swirls
very
little
fizz
appears
on
the
top
and
there
is
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
that
truly
milky
aftertaste
is
bugging
me
a
bit
making
it
somewhat
ahrd
to
drink
it
might
be
ok
if
it
was
balanced
out
with
some
better
flavor
up
front
but
it
is
really
the
only
flavor
it
has
and
so
i
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
oddly
flavored
skim
milk
thin
and
not
sticky
with
little
hop
character
normally
from
a
milk
stout
i
expect
a
typical
stout
flavor
up
front
with
milky
sweatness
coming
later
but
this
only
has
a
milk
finish
and
not
much
else
notes
good
beer
id
certainly
not
turn
it
down
but
there
are
other
sweet
stouts
id
reach
for
first
if
i
could
this
beer
pours
slightly
lighter
in
color
than
your
average
stout
however
it
is
still
almost
black
in
color
there
was
very
little
head
on
the
beer
which
i
traditionally
want
more
of
in
a
stout
the
head
is
a
creamy
brown
not
khaki
or
tan
like
some
have
it
smells
of
dairysugar
and
a
little
bit
of
toffeebutterscotch
and
tastes
pretty
good
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
bells
double
cream
however
it
is
a
solid
american
microbrew
cream
stout
i
recommend
it
if
you
like
cream
stouts
or
are
a
left
hand
fan
you
could
definately
drink
more
than
one
nice
and
easy
on
the
palate
style
points
for
cows
on
bottle
it
smelled
like
a
stout
with
a
shot
of
heavy
cream
sugar
and
chocolate
the
beers
taste
reflected
this
but
it
wasnt
very
stouty
it
didnt
seem
very
adventurous
it
has
its
hops
and
the
tastes
ive
mentioned
but
its
lack
of
carbonation
and
lack
of
complexity
work
against
it
still
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
quality
beverage
that
would
be
excellent
with
a
chocolate
dessert
one
dimensional
being
all
smokey
dark
roasted
malt
a
good
quality
in
a
beer
but
it
shouldnt
be
the
only
one
this
is
a
good
desert
beer
but
there
are
much
better
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
had
some
misgivings
as
i
observed
the
results
of
my
pour
but
got
past
that
once
i
smelled
and
tasted
it
its
not
a
robust
stout
but
a
nice
rather
light
and
smooth
one
thats
worth
taking
a
flyer
on
overall
a
big
hit
with
my
group
of
friends
this
was
the
beer
that
dominated
last
night
delicious
and
will
be
a
future
purchase
again
color
is
a
nice
molasses
brownalmost
black
not
much
head
at
all
but
just
enough
carbonation
aroma
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
taste
is
a
bit
roasty
at
first
but
becomes
quite
sweet
quickly
with
mingling
flavors
of
coffee
and
cholocate
in
the
bacgroung
milk
sugar
is
apparent
and
lends
a
nice
smoothness
to
this
beer
finish
is
still
sweet
a
little
dry
and
leaves
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
my
mouth
mouthfeel
is
fairly
medium
i
would
say
its
fairly
drinkable
but
not
remarkable
ok
but
not
the
best
stout
many
better
sweet
stouts
out
there
taste
the
taste
is
probably
this
beers
best
quality
and
it
is
only
soso
the
stout
is
as
i
expected
very
thin
there
is
faint
malted
barley
present
covered
with
a
very
slick
and
sugary
milk
remnant
drinkability
it
goes
down
really
easy
its
got
very
minimal
hopping
not
very
much
roast
there
is
a
hint
of
smoke
also
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
sweetest
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
its
also
the
most
borderline
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
ive
tasted
it
goes
down
too
easy
and
tastes
sweet
thats
good
for
some
beers
but
its
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
being
left
handed
im
a
sucker
for
anything
that
is
remotely
related
to
lefthandedness
so
i
had
to
pick
up
this
left
hand
milk
stout
when
i
saw
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
too
quickly
in
my
opinion
smell
contains
roasted
malt
tastes
like
a
stout
milkshake
the
milk
sugar
is
very
pronounced
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
but
delicious
nonetheless
the
sweetness
makes
this
beer
good
for
dessert
but
more
than
one
in
a
session
might
be
a
challenge
this
one
looked
and
sounded
good
when
i
bought
it
but
ended
up
dissappointing
me
color
is
the
usual
near
black
with
a
nice
head
it
smells
pretty
good
but
a
little
too
sweet
the
taste
is
just
lacking
anything
that
gives
me
pause
its
sweet
though
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
indicate
but
not
very
rich
theres
a
touch
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
not
much
else
to
talk
about
feels
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
wha
happen
ive
said
it
before
i
could
probably
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
aroma
is
a
decadent
mocha
and
milk
chocolate
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
lead
the
way
with
an
almost
hersheys
sweetness
drys
slightly
in
the
finish
with
roasted
malt
making
an
appearance
this
would
be
worthy
of
a
4
if
not
for
the
metallic
almost
canned
background
flavor
it
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
sadly
the
head
was
almost
nonexistant
and
what
was
there
quickly
faded
the
aroma
was
malty
and
roasted
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
smooth
as
i
anticipated
as
it
was
slightly
prickly
the
taste
is
accentuated
by
a
bitter
roastiness
that
hints
at
coffee
notes
the
milky
texture
is
more
apparent
in
the
finish
which
is
also
exceedingly
dry
and
toasty
just
an
average
milk
stout
expected
more
light
medium
body
but
thats
pushing
it
makes
it
easy
for
anyone
to
put
down
fast
but
theres
not
much
to
it
deep
ruby
color
and
thin
head
that
dissipates
to
a
hairline
ring
and
wisps
of
tan
foam
aroma
suggests
burnt
grains
and
instant
mocha
mix
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
on
the
front
then
resolves
to
roasty
coffeeish
dryish
and
bitter
on
the
finish
it
has
a
weird
watery
feel
in
the
mouth
after
several
quaffs
is
a
pretty
decent
above
average
easy
drinkin
sweet
stout
nice
dark
almost
black
color
head
left
quickly
with
little
lacing
nice
coffee
roasted
aroma
very
inviting
taste
had
a
nice
burnt
malt
light
coffee
taste
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
a
nice
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
easy
enough
to
drink
a
good
stout
that
is
worth
trying
overall
i
give
it
an
eh
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
fantastic
either
maybe
ill
give
it
another
try
again
sometime
this
beer
was
served
way
too
cold
thank
you
very
much
beer
sellar
so
i
had
to
let
it
warm
to
get
any
flavor
out
of
it
it
was
quite
dark
but
not
quite
opaque
deep
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
very
little
head
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
chocoalte
and
some
herbal
notes
flavor
begins
sweet
with
notes
of
chocoalte
just
a
touch
of
coffee
peaks
through
then
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
with
low
carbonation
all
in
all
not
a
bad
milk
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
very
deep
reddishbrown
almost
black
but
not
quite
the
aroma
was
quite
unusual
sweet
slightly
chocolatey
enticing
flavour
was
a
steady
sweetness
as
a
base
with
hints
of
chocolate
burnt
and
subtle
hop
flavours
coming
through
aftertaste
was
mildly
sweet
as
would
be
expected
different
pleasant
to
drink
good
but
not
outstanding
22
oz
bomber
nice
tan
head
the
nose
was
very
sweet
with
lots
of
chocolate
smells
the
hops
were
extremely
subdued
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
the
initial
taste
was
quite
sweet
this
beer
seemed
more
like
a
chocolate
stout
to
me
the
lactose
was
present
but
balanced
well
with
the
malts
to
make
a
chocolate
flavor
i
would
have
pinned
this
with
the
chocolate
stout
moniker
had
i
been
blindfolded
this
beer
is
good
and
highly
drinkable
i
have
to
give
it
to
the
marketing
group
over
at
left
hand
because
they
do
a
bang
up
job
with
their
labels
this
stout
poured
very
thin
little
to
no
head
was
generated
from
an
aggressive
pour
the
color
is
a
deep
red
when
held
to
light
very
subtle
nose
the
first
taste
was
smooth
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
thin
has
a
sweet
flavor
with
chocolate
notes
throughout
the
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
very
wet
if
that
makes
sense
it
makes
my
mouth
water
which
activates
my
reflex
to
drink
more
and
more
and
more
you
get
the
picture
this
is
a
good
party
beer
not
too
heavy
so
you
wont
fill
up
a
nice
simple
stout
left
hand
milk
stout
is
not
a
stout
i
dont
care
what
the
label
says
a
light
porter
maybe
but
not
even
a
very
good
one
of
those
texture
is
a
little
creamy
with
soft
gentle
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
stout
the
flavors
are
really
tasty
i
just
wish
they
were
a
little
more
robust
drinkability
is
good
because
this
is
quite
light
and
easy
drinking
now
whether
youll
want
another
one
is
another
story
as
its
not
too
interesting
a
very
average
beer
at
best
the
smell
should
have
clued
me
in
as
it
had
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
an
off
brewery
smell
the
smell
of
the
mash
tun
first
sip
reminded
me
very
much
of
heineken
dark
not
a
good
thing
at
all
chocolate
and
coffee
were
present
but
quickly
got
ruined
by
a
lackluster
malt
bill
that
seemed
more
like
an
american
macro
with
some
barley
tossed
in
i
love
milk
stouts
but
this
was
a
real
tragedy
the
milk
stout
poured
black
with
red
highlights
it
had
a
small
head
that
quickly
went
down
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
coffee
roasted
malts
and
some
nuttiness
it
was
a
sweet
creamy
stout
and
tasted
of
sweet
malts
initially
with
a
bitter
nutty
coffeelike
finish
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
stout
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
probably
could
have
been
better
balanced
have
had
it
on
a
regular
tap
and
also
from
a
beer
engine
the
beer
engine
makes
it
very
silky
and
very
nice
the
scores
are
for
the
engine
it
pours
with
a
nice
opaque
black
color
with
a
delicate
white
head
sweet
malt
dominates
the
aroma
and
flavor
with
just
barely
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
body
is
rather
thin
compared
to
most
stouts
after
taste
was
pleasant
malt
very
simple
drinkable
and
pleasant
for
lighthearted
drinking
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
stouts
for
the
bud
drinker
poured
a
dark
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
burned
malts
and
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
very
common
with
the
aroma
and
other
beers
in
this
style
but
the
coffee
taste
was
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
liking
in
this
one
poured
black
with
just
the
smallest
of
headslight
coffee
chocolate
earthy
aroma
sweet
malty
first
taste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
coffeeish
aftertaste
a
raisin
taste
came
on
as
it
warmed
all
those
flavors
yet
it
didnt
seem
that
complex
i
will
buy
single
bottles
occasionally
i
expected
a
sweeter
taste
and
a
little
more
body
this
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
but
its
not
bad
either
it
taste
to
me
more
like
a
coffee
mixed
with
nuts
cream
and
some
chocolate
it
was
stronger
on
the
coffee
though
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
red
but
had
a
brownish
head
to
it
it
was
smooth
ill
give
it
that
much
it
actually
got
better
the
warmer
it
got
its
cheap
and
i
like
it
so
i
will
have
to
get
some
more
pours
a
near
black
with
auburn
highlights
and
a
khaki
colored
creamy
head
that
eventually
thins
across
the
surface
of
the
body
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malt
creamed
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
too
spectacular
roasted
chocolate
malt
dominates
the
palate
definitely
a
sweeter
overall
flavor
finish
is
milder
and
has
hardly
any
bitterness
and
no
lingering
dryness
ala
an
irish
stout
which
this
is
not
anyway
i
suppose
i
only
mention
that
because
i
do
prefer
those
qualities
in
a
stout
left
hand
tabernashs
milk
stout
is
a
good
offering
and
worth
trying
just
with
so
many
options
out
there
this
does
little
to
set
itself
apart
nonetheless
a
worthy
offering
taste
like
chocolate
milk
mixed
w
hops
but
in
a
good
way
very
nice
little
brew
we
got
going
on
here
got
the
creamy
feel
mixed
with
a
hintohopness
sits
well
when
you
get
it
down
very
good
for
winter
or
even
early
fall
i
am
digging
this
as
much
as
i
dig

the

enough
to
drink
repeatedly
it
does
represent
the
style
very
well
try
one
if
it
is
handy
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
almost
black
color
and
formed
a
nice
big
medium
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
coffee
and
and
burnt
chocolate
is
present
a
flavor
of
malt
and
coffee
fairly
light
for
this
style
and
a
slight
burnt
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
id
have
to
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
there
are
better
more
complex
more
intriguing
stouts
but
this
one
sure
was
a
joy
to
drink
this
is
another
beer
i
probably
would
have
passed
on
if
not
for

but
didnt
last

in

right
away
very
sweet
inviting
no
other
aromas
detected
but
man
this
smells
good
taste
lives
up
to
the
name
this
is
one
of
the
most
bizarre
beers
ive
had
starts
off
with
a
mild
malty
coffee
taste
then
gives
way
to
a
truly
milklike
taste
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
if
slightly
thin
for
a
stout
but
still
good
smooth
it
did
have
a
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
feel
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
is
easy
to
quaff
interesting
suprisingly
good
beer
by
the
way
the

is
totally
lost
in
the

a
great

loads
of
roasted

the

bombards
my
palate
with
the
same
flavors
of
coffee

mocha
blended
together
very
smoothly
for
a
nice
bittersweet
finish
that
is
very
creamy
in
mouthfeel
typical
of
the
milk
stouts
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
become
more
intense
but
i
do
not
notice
anything
new
seemed
a
bit
thinner
in
the

than
i
was
expecting
but

definitely
made
up
for
it
i
am
also
very

to

that

after
the

im
a

let
down

its

the

leaves
something
of

there
the

says
that
very

thing
however
the
bier
does
not
in
any

leave
a
heavy

on

how

a

stout
than
this
style
in
general
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
would
be
worth
introducing
to
people
who
believe
that
stouts
are
too
dark
and
heavy
to
session
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
double
chocolate
stout
that
you
can
find
at
the
super
market
here
in
mexico
you
can
find
much
better
chocolate
stouts
in
specialty
stores
great
chocolate
flavors
very
easy
drinking
and
delicate
with
a
great
nitrocan
looks
great
smells
great
slightly
underwhelming
taste
i
may
be
biased
towards
other
chocolate
stouts
but
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
stouts
always
throw
me
as
an
ipa
drinker
it
looks
heavy
and
goes
down
like
water
taste
with
this
one
is
outstanding
looks
great
smells
great
even
tastes
great
for
the
initial
hit
to
the
tongue
aftertaste
on
this
is
not
my
thing
though
mouthfeel
is
only
soso
still
a
solid
stout
first
quarter
of
the
beer
was
tolerable
after
that
it
was
an
overwhelming
hershey
syrup
like
taste
excellent
beer
i
recommend
it
very
dark
brown
to
black
very
nice
foamy
head
cappuccinolike
started
around
52
degrees
chocolate
was
most
present
in
the
aroma
but
not
dominating
with
some
roasted
malt
taste
was
consistent
with
smell
but
with
a
bit
of
coffee
too
was
semismooth
wish
it
was
creamier
alcohol
was
a
little
more
present
than
i
would
have
liked
feel
was
on
the
thinner
side
but
not
too
bad
different
strokes
for
different
folks
if
you
like
chocolate
and
a
smoother
ride
i
suggest
for
example
samuel
smiths
over
this
one
but
if
you
like
your
chocolate
tamed
by
a
more
traditional
beerale
taste
then
give
it
a
try
try
in
cans
it
has
a
much
smoother
taste
nitrocan
malt
and
chocolate
aroma

with
a
creamy
tan

that
coats
the
glass

with
a
touch

thick
and
silky
clean
smooth
finish
o
good
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
some
others
ive
had
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
dont
like
chocolate
but
for
some
reason
really
like
this
stout
you
can
taste
the
chocolate
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
my
favorite
pub
has
this
on
tap
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
ever
nice
and
chocolatey
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
plenty
but
i
cant
say
it
was
everything
i
wanted
it
to
be
too
little
body
and
a
slightly
underwhelming
taste
experience
left
me
wishing
i
had
grabbed
a
bottle
of
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
instead
just
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
i
prefer
to
enjoy
the
chocolate
and
beer
separated
good
but
not
exactly
a
milk
sweet
stout
in
my
opinion
too
toasty
solid
brew
no
complaints
about
this
one
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
good
all
around
and
a
good
rep
for
the
style
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
nose
chocolate
and
coffee
going
down
nice
black
pour
and
creamy
enough
will
definitely
drink
again
and
will
probably
recommend
it
as
a
starting
point
to
the
style
if
asked
reasonably
priced
double
chocolate
stout
always
makes
me
feel
good
as
it
is
accessible
where
im
at
o
one
of
the
two
beers
bourbon
county
stout
being
the
other
that
led
me
down
the
path
to
embracing
and
appreciating
craft
beer
this
is
still
my
favorite
sweetmilk
stout
so
easy
to
drink
yet
fairly
complex
rewarding
at
different
layers
read
a
lot
of
good
reviews
but
it
tasted
like
artificial
chocolate
maybe
i
drank
this
wrong
temp
was
50
maybe
should
be
colder
great
transitional
beer
its
what
got

overall
having

on
this
all

in
a

some
years

i
can
attest
firsthand
to
its

drinking
a

can

is
a

much
but
if
its
ever
on

and
on

this
is
the
type
of
chocolatey
stout
i
often
crave
and
this
one
delivers
big
time
in
a
word
outstanding
hope
they
remove
this
bad
artificial
flavouring
and
return
to
what
this
used
to
be
a
great
brew
this
was
a
beer
that
holds
true
to
the
english
styles
nothing
over
the
top
yet
very
high
quality
was
expecting
a
little
more
mouth
feel
as
the
bottle
claims
oats
were
used
and
the
word
double
is
in
the
name
either
way
a
solid
brew
for
a
nice
treat
during
the
cold
winter
months
here
in

with
hints
of

a

for

tastes
but
still
very

distinct
coffee
on
the
front
yummy
nice
creamy

smooth
and
tasty
as
stated
pure
luxury
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
carbonation
but
with
a
nitro

it
is
like
silk
this
is
one
great
beer
overall
for
me
sam
smiths
make
the
perfect
chocolate
stout
this
runs
it
fairly
close
but
doesnt
quite
match
it
in
my
opinion
its
probably
worth
pointing
out
that
im
definitely
a
stout
fan
and
along
with
the
sam
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
this
is
going
to
become
a
regular
on
my
shelf

color

thin
to
non

slight

mild
taste
think
guinness
lite
hint
of
chocolate
not
a
bad
beer
but
something
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
made
a
float
with
ben
and
jerrys
with
this
stout
and
it
was
delicious
i
had
about
16
oz
left
in
the
bottle
and
by
itself
its
delicious
amazing
perfect
chocolate
flavor
definently
buying
again
this
has
taste
like
few
others
smooth
yet
upfront
tasty
nice
chocolate
malty
aroma
and
ours
with
a
nice
coffee
coloured
head
but
it
doesnt
last
long
good
mouthfeel
with
a
balance
of
carbonation
and
stouty
fullness
the
rich
malt
and
fruity
chocolate
flavours
come
through
well
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
but
just
felt
it
was
missing
a
little
something
to
be
really
great
hard
to
describe
but
a
little
bit
thin
in
some
way
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweet
aftertaste
and
while
chocolate
stouts
arent
usually
my
thing
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
underwhelmed
with
this
one
ive
heard
the
nitro
can
version
is
much
better
perhaps
ill
give
it
a
try
and
rereview
at
a
later
date
the
best
chocolate
stout
bar
none
one
of
my
favorites
amazing
beer
love
mixing
fruit
crafts
with
it
awesome
beer
very
smooth
tasty
overall
frankly
this
stout
could
use
more
backbone
its
not
living
up
to
its
name
d
smooth
drinkable
and
well
balanced
very
creamy
from
the
nitro
flavor
is
most
definitely
dark
chocolate
on
the
back
of
the
palette
but
no
lingering
sweetness
that
would
come
from
actual
chocolate
enjoyable
an
average
beer
with
a
treacherous
smell
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
and
tasted
better
local
chocolate
beers
disappointed
its
ok
more
dark
fruity
than
chocolatey
though
newly
introduced
in
the
local
market
and
glad
to
have
it
available
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
tasted
bland
and
barely
noticed
any
chocolate
flavor
or
aroma
surprised
that
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
it
taste
like
beer
and
chocolate
tin
cans
perhaps
only
because
of
the
broad
availability
and
rated
as
a
comparison
to
other
stouts
compared
to
the
quality
microbrews
of
this
variety
i
find
it
inferior
at
the
strong
end
for
chocolate
notes
with
a
nice
sweetbitter
aftertaste
nice
attempt
at
a
good
beer
just
came
away
lacking
something
overall
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
milksweet
stout
id
have
it
again
as
dessert
had
a
very
outputting
smell
and
taste
pours
near
black
with
a
brown
head
that
doesnt
trail
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
cream
and
chocolate
very
heavy
the
taste
is
equally
heavy
with
chocolate
being
the
star
of
the
beer
with
lighter
notes
of
coffee
on
the
end
pours
near
black
with
a
brown
head
that
doesnt
trail
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
cream
and
chocolate
very
heavy
the
taste
is
equally
heavy
with
chocolate
being
the
star
of
the
beer
with
lighter
notes
of
coffee
on
the
end
very
decadent
but
overall
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
for
more
fun
make
a
black
and
tan
with
this
and
wells
banana
bread
beer
for
a
chocolate
covered
banana
black
and
tan
really
tasty
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
seems
to
do
more
or
less
exactly
what
it
is
setting
out
to
do
well
balanced
and
a
pretty
decent
mouth
feel
this
beer
is
one
i
would
recommend
to
others
and
will
actively
seek
out
again
seems
to
pair
well
with
sweet
dishes
on
nitro
tap
had
this
twice
in
a
couple
of
days
strangely
on
the
2nd
visit
this
seemed
to
lack
all
the
chocolatey
goodness
to
the
point
where
my
gf
and
i
both
questioned
and
received
samplers
of
this
and
other
stouts
on
tap
to
compare
seems
others
have
noted
some
inconsistencies
as
well
anyhow
i
love
chocolate
and
i
love
stout
so
this
really
puts
it
together
well
wow
a
selfbrewing
canadian
friend
recommended
this
beer
so
i
drank
it
right
now
i
bought
this
beer
at
fonthills
lcbo
in
pelham
on
canada
its
colour
and
look
seem
very
strong
but
it
is
not
usually
i
feel
stout
is
little
bit
strong
to
me
but
this
is
not
very
drinkable
and
nice
taste
like
everybody
here
said
it
has
sweet
chocolate
smell
too
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
very
creamy
smooth
stout
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
with
bitter
chocolate
and
again
lots
of
cream
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
distracts
from
the
smooth
overall
impression
chocolate
becomes
very
flashy
in
the
end
mingles
well
together
with
coffee
notes
metallic
carbonation
is
still
a
little
unpleasant
creamy
bitter
long
lasting
aftertaste
overall
extremely
pleasant
can
be
enjoyed
with
a
variety
of
foods
i
drank
mine
with
french
cheeses
and
a
salad
and
it
was
fitting
perfectly
definitely
will
drink
again

football
stout
an
excellent
stout
not
as
dry
as
i
always
like
but
definitely
excellent
in
its
own
way
delicious
rich
smooth
and
chocolatey
as
youd
expect
great
aroma
as
well
not
too
intrusive
and
definitely
a
pure
luxury
as
the
label
implies
o
not
very
good

for

with

a
very
solid

stout
a
bit
thin
on

mouthfeel
but
overall
great
and
definitely
worth
a
try
like
a
guiness
but
thicker
meaty
was
the
first
thought
cocoa
flavor
but
not
sweet
kind
of
flat
mouthfeel
expected
it
to
be
phenomenal
per
a
friends
recommendation
not
what
expected
i
was
expecting
the
strength
of
a
founders
breakfast
stout
but
this
it
is
not
simply
waving
a
hershey
bar
over
a
can
of
guinness
doesnt
make
it
a
double
chocolate
stout
the
closest
this
comes
to
double
anything
is
a
double
of
guinness
which
i
like
the
poor
rating
is
because
it
pretends
to
be
something
else
do
yourself
and
wallet
a
favor
and
just
have
a
guinness
4050
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
semithick
and
very
dark
stout
is
very
tasty
the
name
is
not
a
misnomer
you
can
really
taste
the
dark
undertones
of
rich
chocolate
underneath
a
very
complex
landscape
of
roasted
malt
head
retention
was
decent
almost
a
quarter
inch
that
remained
for
the
entirety
of
the
glass
very
drinkable
not
incredibly
heavy
on
the
alcohol
content
very
highly
recommended
o
a
solid
beer
will
have
again
overall
a
fantastic
winter
evening
beer
which
is
great
accompanied
with
a
mars
bar
not
a
session
beer
as
its
quite
heavy
but
1
or
2
go
down
a
treat
aroma
and
taste
have
hints
of
coffee
but
really
this
is
all
about
that
dominant
dark
chocolate
taste
its
pretty
onedimensional
with
a
thick
sweet
chocolate
malt
and
minimal
hop
contribution
for
chocoholics
like
me
though
this
makes
for
a
wonderful
dessert

im
glad
i
bought
this
and
if
they
stock
more
ill
go
back
again
this
is
a
nice
potent
lovely
aromatic
and
fullflavored
stout
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
chocolate
like
the
name
suggests
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
nonetheless
nice
and
smooth
and
a
great
milk
stout
however
this
stuff
is
foulness
personified
people
can
moon
on
about
the
composition
and
characteristics
but
what
matters
is
the
taste
this
beer
should
be
poured
down
the
drain
you
couldnt
pay
me
to
drink
this
crap
harmonized
with
bonbon
milk
appearance
black
opaque
no
foam
perhaps
be
stupidly
cold
aroma
very
light
chocolate
roasting
taste
i
felt
more
chocolate
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
flavor
but
helped
enhance
harmonization

pretty
good
but
slightly
to

for
my

very
much
a
dark
beer
o

you
get
what
you
pay
for
with
this
beer
you
buy
this
expecting
chocolate
and
thats
exactly
what
you
get
very
tasty
beer
that
i
think
mostly
anybody
could
enjoy
o
a
tasty
beer
with
a
subpar
mouthfeel
was
told
i
had
to
try
this
so
here
it
is
pours
a
light
black
unable
to
see
through
nice
tan
head
that
holds
on
for
a
long
time
aroma
is
of
light
barley
and
hot
chocolate
taste
seems
a
little
watery
but
overall
a
good
flavor
with
highlights
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
nice
and
crispy
and
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
tastes
like
an
actual
cup
of
bittersweet
hot
chocolate
with
some
marshmallows
nice
brew
but
anything
that
could
be
drunk
in
multiples
glad
i
tasted
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
absolutely
beautiful
beer
and
i
appreciate
the
lowabv
but
i
was
definitely
expecting
more
of
a
dessert
stout
with
this
name
actually
it
might
make
a
much
better
breakfast
stout
o
3
75
a
classic
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
nice
to
come
back
to
every
once
in
awhile
koht
estonia
taste
is
like
the
smell
chocolate
mocca
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
awesome
flavor
and
full
bodied
goes
great
with
a
splash
of
kahlua
or
other
coffee
liqueur
overall
a
nice
malty
stout
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
despite
the
big
nose
and
roasted
malt
flavor
the
beer
is
relatively
light
and
easy
drinking
the
beer
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
german
doppelbock
revisiting
this
beer
after
about
a
year
still
one
of
the
finest
stouts
on
the
market
the
double
chocolate
in
name
is
a
little
misleading
chocolate
is
natural
and
faint
much
better
in
the
nitro
can
than
in
the
bottle
just
picked
up
a
case
yesterday
and
the
only
flaw
in
this
case
is
that
they
tend
to
disappear
fast
than
any
other
beer
i
buy
probably
the
kind
of
stout
my
wife
would
like
since
she
doesnt
drink
stouts
decent
but
not
memorable
other
than
the
rootbeer
float
like
creamyness
overall
one
of
the
few
beers
where
i
put
the
mouthfeel
as
a
bigger
draw
to
have
this
beer
again
than
the
taste
i
usually
care
about
taste
most
and
smell
a
distant
second
i
had
this
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
5
days
while
i
went
out
of
town
while
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
i
may
have
hyped
it
up
a
little
in
my
own
head
maybe
a
touch
let
down
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
there
is
a
little
aroma
of
chocolate
but
man
does
it
ever
come
out
in
the
tasting
i
also
probably
served
it
too
cold
i
really
should
set
up
a
dedicated
beer
fridge
even
still
the
aroma
only
intensified
mildly
as
it
warmed
was
not
overly
sweet
and
was
certainly
indulgent
just
as
the
label
claims
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
i
also
think
that
it
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
on
nitrogen
just
to
amplify
the
creamy
texture
they
were
trying
to
achieve
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
superb
beer
o
fantastic
edit
my
tastes
have
changed
since
the
original
review
having
become
a
more
widelysample
stout
drinker
new
scores
reflect
current
opinion
overall
a
good
decadent
stout
thats
well
worth
the
reputation
get
one
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
surprised
me
in
a
very
pleasant
way
the
appearance
is
that
of
a
dark
stout
smell
is
roasted
malts
with
very
strong
scent
of
a
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
is
by
far
the
best
part
with
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
coming
up
front
along
with
the
malt
with
a
slightly
bitter
hit
at
the
end
the
chocolate
stays
with
you
throughout
the
entire
experience
excellent
beer
for
desert
or
with
a
hearty
meal
glass
imperial
pint
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
sweet
stout
ive
ever
tried
and
i
give
it
very
high
marks
it
is
hands
down
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
tried
purchased
as
part
of
a
four
pack
of
440
ml
cans
for
right
around
9something
i
want
to
pass
on
some
kudos
to
hennessey
market
in
butte
montana
for
bringing
more
variety
in
all
good
things
most
especially
in
beer
cheerio
as
the
label
notes
this
is
pure
luxury
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
every
now
and
then
it
is
worth
it
to
me
to
pay
the
extra
buck
or
two
for
fourpack
cans
to
drink
the
youngs
double
chocolate
versus
the
old
standard
guinness
stout
overall
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
buy
again
pours
a
super
dark
black
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
leaves
a
nice
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
awesome
very
sweet
and
chocolaty
taste
is
very
good
i
taste
lots
of
rich
dark
malts
with
the
chocolate
flavor
really
coming
thru
in
this
brew
easy
drinking
and
full
flavored
a
well
balanced
brew
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
good
1
finger
beige
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
and
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
layers
the
aroma
is
very
nice
of
chocolate
cocoa
powder
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
even
better
with
lots
of
good
chocolate
flavor
flowed
up
by
the
roasted
malts
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
really
great
brew
overall
dark
velvety
creamy
and
a
well
balanced
sweetness
notes
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
83
pours
black
with
swirling
creamy
khaki
head
smells
of
tons
of
roasted
malts
and
some
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
very
low
carbonation
taste
of
chocolate
and
tons
of
it
crazy
awesome
good
wowee
wow
wow
wow
super
smooth
and
silky
on
the
old
kisser
pours
pitch
black
with
brown
thick
foamy
head
the
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
never
goes
away
like
it
is
stuck
there
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
perhaps
some
black
licorice
thick
roasted
malty
taste
i
can
definitely
discern
the
dark
chocolate
and
perhaps
some
raisins
very
smooth
thick
taste
almost
like
a
milkshake
but
not
sweet
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
my
first
foray
into
milk
stouts
it
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
the
beer
is
more
filling
than
any
ipa
i
have
had
if
the
acrid
character
were
gone
and
the
vanilla
tamed
a
bit
would
be
truly
exceptional
that
said
great
depth
of
chocolate
flavor
overall
an
amazing
stout
and
a
great
milksweet
stout
i
have
had
this
in
bottles
and
the
nitro
can
wow
makes
a
big
difference
simply
great
i
will
be
picking
up
this
again
soon
its
not
bad
at
all
but
i
expected
more
of
a
chocolate
punch
enjoy
dark
chocolate
clearly
dominates
the
profile
in
this
luscious
silky
brew
with
some
herbal
coffee
and
spicy
undertones
poking
through
palate
wise
the
beer
feels
very
clean
even
if
some
diacetyl
can
be
detected
denouncing
its
british
pedigree
overall
this
beer
feels
and
drinks
like
a
classically
british
complex
stout
its
biggest
flaw
is
its
lack
of
any
real
wowing
factor
or
unique
spin
to
set
it
apart
of
the
other
great
stouts
of
the
world
heard
good
things
about
this
one
looks
good
smells
good
and
has
a
pretty
decent
taste
a
little
light
on
the
foam
and
carbonation
though
my
only
problem
with
this
one
is
the
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
i
personally
believe
that
a
beer
that
walks
and
talks
like
a
stout
should
have
a
little
more
presence
than
this
still
pretty
good
though
in
overall
it
is
a
great
one
take
two
bottles
if
you
see
it
overall
solid
brew
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
than
a
double
chocolate
if
it
were
more
chocolate
rich
it
would
be
a
bestinclass
brew
for
the
style
o
well
you
win
some
and
you
lose
some
with
this
one
i
lost
very
disappointed
with
a
name
double
chocolate
i
was
expecting
a
real
deep
chocolate
taste
wont
be
picking
up
another
one
of
these
any
time
soon
o
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
o
falls
a
little
short
of
the
pure
luxury
promised
on
the
label
but
a
drinkable
enough
chocolatish
stout
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
is
superior
and
in
the
same
price
range
o
i
will
be
having
this
again
for
dessert
i
only
bought
one
this
time
sadly
im
a
tried
and
true
fan
of
chocolate
stouts
and
this
is
among
my
top
10
wow
creeping
through
one
of
my
local
lq
stores
to
find
how
didnt
i
know
about
this
before
an
average
stout
ive
had
before
but
wait
is
that
a
nitro
can
different
beer
altogether
on
nitro
dark
rich
color
creamy
mocha
head
smooooth
creamy
dry
chocolate
not
to
much
but
just
enough
to
smooth
have
3
i
did
just
before
i
reviewed
this
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
english
style
beers
always
kind
of
watery
and
lacking
a
fuller
flavor
to
me
it
is
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
heft
to
my
stouts
o
smooth
smooth
smooth
creamy
and
with
just
enough
sweetness
this
is
a
good
stout
im
not
sure
about
the
addition
of
mineral
water
though
as
the
minerality
can
be
distracting
just
a
bit
more
body
and
more
full
flavor
and
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
but
as
it
is
its
just
pretty
good
o
good
overall
i
like
it
but
i
dont
love
it
overall
this
beer
is
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
there
is
nothing
objectionable
about
it
some
people
hate
on
nitrogen
being
used
in
place
of
co2
when
serving
beer
but
i
am
not
one
of
them
i
think
it
serves
relatively
straightforward
stouts
like
this
one
very
well
by
adding
an
extra
dimension
to
them
obviously
not
quite
on
par
with
a
good
milk
stout
served
via
nitro
tap
but
as
good
as
one
could
expect
i
wont
hesitate
to
enjoy
this
one
again
o
i
like
this
beer
and
id
buy
it
more
often
at
the
right
price
however
for
this
to
be
a
beer
which
really
blows
me
away
it
would
need
to
have
a
sweeter
aspect
more
intense
flavour
heavier
body
to
balance
the
smoothness
of
the
carbonation
which
all
in
all
would
probably
also
involve
a
higher
abv
a
beer
which
i
definitely
recommend
trying
as
it
represents
a
more
unusual
style
milksweet
stout
and
format
nitrous
can
nice
otherwise
it
is
still
a
good
mild
stout
o
i
know
this
is
a
classic
but
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
though
o
it
may
be
fairly
commonplace
but
this
beer
is
delicious
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
recommend
and
go
back
to
often
overall
good
yearround
chocolate
stout
not
outstanding
o
a
delicious
sweet
stout
with
a
great
body
especially
considering
its
5
abv
and
is
very
drinkable
i
would
for
sure
seek
this
out
again
wonderful
beer
o
a
okay
stout
i
believe
there
are
too
many
stouts
out
there
that
are
better
overall
definitely
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
unless
it
has
been
changed
to
include
some
carbonation
or
gained
some
bitterness
good
luck
to
all
who
give
this
stout
a
whirl
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
chocolate
stout
o
a
really
really
tasty
beverage
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
name
would
suggest
a
nice
step
up
to
a
guiness
or
other
mild
porter
or
stout
how
can
you
not
dig
this
stout
its
tasty
and
aromatic
and
subtly
decadent
o
4
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
little
overhyped
nice
and
creamy
different
from
you
standard
american
stout
for
sure
overall
definitely
a
good
beer
that
would
gladly
drink
again
but
personally
i
didnt
see
what
separated
this
from
many
other
stouts
other
than
a
slightly
more
chocolatecentric
beer
o
solid
easy
drinking
stout
does
well
to
include
chocolate
flavors
in
an
easy
drinking
beer
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
i
also
think
this
would
be
incredible
with
nitro
ill
have
to
pick
up
some
nitro
cans
overall
love
it
always
a
treat
great
dessert
beer
my
girlfriend
has
made
brownies
with
this
beer
and
those
are
also
awesome
i
would
recommend
it
huge
head
that
lasts
a
couple
of
minutes
nice
dark
color
bits
of
dark
particles
came
out
of
the
bottle
at
the
end
of
the
pour
not
much
chocolate
taste
or
smell
at
all
compared
to
smiths
however
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
have
easily
had
2
or
3
of
these
without
any
fatigue
the
lack
of
any
real
chocolate
taste
or
sweetness
was
the
only
letdown
for
me
the
label
was
right
when
they
say
that
this
beer
is
not
meant
to
be
overly
sweet
was
not
sweet
at
all
more
of
a
coffee
beer
than
chocolate
a
solid
stout
by
any
standards
recommended
the
legendary
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
it
pours
pitch
black
with
little
to
no
head
but
i
had
it
in
a
bottle
and
not
the
draft
can
which
would
give
it
a
nice
creamy
head
there
is
a
chocolate
aroma
and
a
taste
almost
of
chocolate
milk
but
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
the
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
to
give
it
a
dark
chocolate
finish
and
keep
it
from
being
overly
sweet
the
bottle
is
not
as
creamy
as
on
draft
or
out
of
the
draft
can
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
had
this
award
winning
beer
at
my
local
craft
beer
bar
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
thick
mocha
head
no
carbonation
detected
head
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
good
lacing
all
around
the
glass
smell
is
of
course
chocolate
and
malt
the
first
taste
is
like
an
explosion
of
chocolate
flavors
really
has
that
gourmet
dark
chocolate
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
leaves
a
sweet
bitterness
lingering
on
my
tung
to
savor
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
if
anyone
thinks
chocolate
and
beer
dont
mix
youngs
will
prove
it
does
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
a
bunch
over
the
years
smooth
and
delicious
maybe
try
a
stout
float
feel
it
feels
nice
washing
it
around
makes
it
frothy
and
a
little
fizzy
overall
a
very
solid
offering
easily
had
two
o
killa
brew
ill
recommend
this
one
for
sure
definitely
lives
up
to
the
name
and
definitely
pleases
this
chocolate
fan
o
ive
only
had
a
few
chocolate
stouts
but
this
one
so
far
was
the
best
it
was
in
a
bottle
dated
1012
and
this
is
1013
maybe
the
extra
ageing
added
to
the
balance
and
flavor
because
i
did
not
notice
any
bite
or
alcohol
burn
and
it
had
quite
a
chocolate
character
quite
good
and
will
be
going
back
to
see
if
i
can
snatch
up
some
more
of
the
12
year
excellent
desert
beer
overall
very
average
aroma
promised
something
that
the
flavor
couldnt
deliver
o
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
stouts
owhat
a
nice
dessert
beer
it
is
sweet
but
not
syrupy
or
sugary
and
the
double
chocolate
is
similarly
dry
and
milky
without
verging
into
bitterness
or
coffee
flavors
this
is
not
some
massively
complicated
barrel
aged
monster
but
it
is
a
pretty
delicious
and
easytodrink
beer
this
would
pair
well
with
more
chocolate
or
other
dessert
foods
o
wow
finally
got
to
try
this
and
it
is
a
must
have
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
in
a
good
way
i
was
hoping
for
a
choco
beer
and
turned
out
with
a
normal
stout
not
bad
but
i
feel
like
it
is
almost
incorrectly
labeled
i
will
try
not
to
let
my
disappointment
affect
the
scores
too
much
overall
an
old
favorite
from
time
spent
in
england
this
is
first
time
ive
had
this
from
a
can
seems
less
chocolately
than
i
remember
it
being
on
tap
at
the
kings
arms
in
oxford
but
still
an
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
sweet
stout
o
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
joins
a
short
list
of
my
goto
stouts
that
i
would
encourage
people
to
try
an
excellent
beer
that
will
be
in
the
front
of
my
mind
until
i
come
across
something
better
huge
difference
in
taste
and
body
between
bottle
can
and
draft
draft
by
far
the
best
followed
a
ways
back
by
bottle
and
the
can
was
outright
nasty
not
sure
that
many
more
words
are
necessary
most
reviews
ramble
on
and
seems
like
most
people
just
want
to
hear
themselves
babble
get
to
the
point
youngs
such
a
beautiful
beer
with
its
frothy
mocha
head
prevalent
chocolate
notes
are
a
trait
i
value
in
stouts
unfortunately
the
body
of
this
stout
is
too
thin
almost
watery
and
always
leaves
me
wanting
more
an
above
average
milk
stout
that
remains
a
sentimental
favorite
i
love
youngs
now
wells
and
young
my
first
truly
english
beer
pours
beautiful
foamy
head
that
never
stops
looks
like
a
geyser
heavy
mouthful
smell
cocoa
taste
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
coffee
it
is
very
sweet
i
wonder
if
there
is
some
lactose
in
it
a
typical
english
sweet
stout
one
of
the
first
english
brews
it
holds
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
this
is
my
perfect
beer
dark
rich
beer
that
carbonates
to
a
full
rich
head
which
delivers
a
strong
and
rich
aroma
of
a
proper
stout
its
appearance
also
delivers
on
taste
a
rich
stout
with
a
subtle
chocolate
taste
if
not
also
coffee
i
have
introduced
many
to
this
beer
and
have
never
had
any
complaints
some
have
said
upon
their
first
taste
that
they
usually
dont
like
dark
beers
but
particularly
like
this
one
o
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
come
back
to
again
and
again
had
this
as
a
dessert
some
time
after
eating
chinese
hot
pot
and
it
proved
to
be
a
nice
contrast
to
the
spice
i
had
earlier
o
a
classic
english
ale
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
definitely
wouldnt
buy
again
i
guess
i
could
drink
it
again
if
offered
again
nothing
special
overall
above
average
milk
stout
nothing
that
amazes
but
still
a
highly
drinkable
beer
give
it
a
try
just
dont
expect
a
whole
lot
of
chocolate
it
simply
isnt
there
o
a
change
of
pace
but
was
wanting
more
from
a
stout
the
lack
of
any
head
made
it
look
like
flat
coke
not
bad
but
found
myself
wanting
more
complexity
overall
a
fantastic
winter
beer
or
surprisingly
enough
an
excellent
evening
summer
beer
fantastic
if
paired
with
heavy
pasta
dishes
taste
was
excellent
the
dark
chocolate
really
stood
out
with
great
balance
overall
and
not
too
sweet
as
some
stouts
in
this
category
can
be
it
was
smooth
with
a
great
texture
color
and
feel
it
was
perfectly
stout
the
chocolate
flavors
blend
nicely
its
a
milk
stout
so
its
creamy
and
kinda
sweet
a
perfect
after
dinner
beverage
this
milk
stout
was
awesome
i
am
a
chocolate
fiend
and
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
smell
was
excellent
and
full
of
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
anticipated
though
the
pour
was
extremely
smooth
and
the
consistency
was
thick
the
color
was
very
dark
almost
black
with
virtually
no
head
the
flavor
was
great
again
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
would
have
liked
but
great
none
the
less
it
is
not
very
strong
but
great
flavor
with
great
consistency
brief
review
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
long
i
just
want
to
keep
sipping
this
worth
the
price
of
admission
its
an
excellent
beer
double
chocolate
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
large
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
slight
roasted
and
malty
aroma
but
rather
weak
the
taste
is
strong
with
chocolate
flavors
very
creamy
and
some
roasted
malt
flavors
make
it
through
as
well
nice
and
creamy
just
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
overall
a
very
nice
chocolate
stout
o
very
eay
to
drink
not
overly
bitter
would
make
a
great
compliment
to
dessert
but
does
just
find
on
its
own
this
one
is
a
classic
o
the
chocolate
pairs
well
with
the
stout
base
the
touchstone
of
chocolate
stouts
and
one
that
sports
wonderful
chocolate
notes
without
being
overly
sweet
t
the
chocolate
stout
that
sets
the
standard
for
others
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
from
the
nitrotap
if
you
get
the
chance
seems
even
silkier
than
i
remember
from
the
can
or
bottle
aromas
and
flavors
make
you
feel
like
the
beer
should
be
sweet
while
there
is
some
residual
sugar
in
the
beer
the
light
hop
bitterness
balances
nicely
against
the
richness
of
the
beer
and
keeps
everything
clean
550ml
can
pours
a
rich
thick
black
with
a
medium
beige
head
has
very
good
head
retention
and
lacing
that
last
throughout
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
malt
some
caramel
taste
is
sweet
dark
chocolate
malt
some
mild
roasty
flavor
with
light
bitterness
palate
is
a
full
rich
creamy
slightly
oily
mouth
feel
mild
carbonation
has
a
nice
dark
chocolate
malt
mild
roasty
lightly
bitter
ending
a
very
rich
creamy
and
flavorful
brew
very
enjoyable
o
my
favorite
beer
overall
i
was
disappointed
to
be
honest
but
my
expectations
were
high
it
is
not
a
bad
stout
that
is
for
sure
however
it
falls
short
of
the
mark
in
too
many
areas
the
aroma
isnt
nearly
strong
enough
the
chocolate
taste
isnt
nearly
prominent
enough
there
is
not
enough
sweetness
for
a
sweetstout
the
body
was
too
thin
and
subtle
but
weird
harsh
aftertaste
as
mentioned
by
a
few
other
lessthanpositive
reviews
maybe
it
was
just
an
old
bottle
i
love
the
chocolate
in
the
smell
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
follow
up
on
it
i
think
its
a
good
stout
just
not
great
i
recommend
it
like
a
mack
10
back
yard
boogy
yep
feel
world
class
chocolate
stout
hands
down
always
on
my
shopping
list
and
my
favorite
on
saint
paddys
day
i
definitely
recommend
it
to
others
for
its
taste
but
definitely
not
my
choice
for
a
regular
buy
ogood
tasting
chocolate
stout
smooth
to
sip
and
la
abv
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
when
had
in
the
proper
format
id
highly
recommend
the
nitrocan
as
its
an
entirely
different
brew
seemingly
in
this
format
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
finishes
with
a
curious
bitterness
and
almost
a
pinch
of
redwine
like
acidity
which
really
round
out
the
complexities
and
make
it
an
intriguing
drinking
experience
with
each
sip
would
highly
recommend
especially
on
nitro
overall
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
great
chocolate
stout
this
was
dark
and
tasty
and
ill
definitely
be
having
it
again
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
not
sure
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
bottle
since
i
had
this
one
on
tap
before
on
london
but
the
bottle
was
definitely
a
disappointment
oi
loved
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
and
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
not
a
beer
for
a
long
session
but
would
be
great
with
a
piece
of
cake
or
a
brownie
for
dessert
the
taste
is
rich
with
baking
chocolate
and
smoke
mild
bitterness
toward
the
end
but
the
chocolate
lingers
on
as
well
this
is
the
definition
of
a
chocolate
stout
overall
this
is
extremely
wellmade
and
one
that
is
going
to
be
hard
to
resist
when
shopping
at
the
store
give
its
availability
i
can
only
think
that
this
is
consistent
on
a
regular
basis
dont
pass
up
for
as
long
as
i
did
o
very
enjoyable
but
quite
filling
good
way
to
end
the
day
overall
a
very
good
brew
got
this
bottle
for
1
74
on
clearance
and
would
gladly
pay
much
more
for
it
thoroughly
enjoyed
o
great
beer
wish
the
abv
was
on
the
higher
side
but
allinall
if
you
like
the
taste
and
smell
of
coffee
in
your
beer
this
is
a
treat
o
great
to
cold
days
this
beer
is
delightful
and
complex
but
is
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
anyway
it
is
great
in
its
style
o
reminds
me
of
a
much
more
flavorful
guinness
in
a
nitrocan
not
a
huge
fan
of
nitro
infused
beers
because
it
takes
away
from
the
flavor
however
wells
youngs
made
this
work
i
wont
rush
to
seek
this
out
again
but
would
recommend
it
to
someone
that
is
on
the
fence
about
stouts
o
not
a
bad
creamy
smooth
stout
lacks
a
little
in
intensity
but
nevertheless
very
nice
to
drink
on
a
cold
evening
oa
good
milksweet
stout
not
as
good
as
the
reviews
show
but
still
a
fine
brew
i
believe
buffalo
sweat
and
left
hands
are
still
much
better
because
they
are
smootherhave
a
fuller
body
its
not
what
i
expected
but
knowing
what
youre
getting
it
isnt
a
terrible
beer
either
i
was
excited
at
first
but
the
taste
brought
my
hopes
down
and
the
feel
dashed
them
i
could
probably
drop
my
numbers
more
but
the
look
and
the
smell
were
both
quite
impressive
o
pretty
good
would
be
as
nice
after
meal
drink
not
complex
but
its
a
straight
forward
milk
stout
and
its
right
where
it
should
be
if
your
looking
for
it
to
stand
out
big
time
than
you
might
be
disappointed
o
just
wellcrafted
and
tothepoint
an
excellent
mellowing
out
beer
the
label
reads
pure
luxury
and
id
agree
very
drinkable
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
cult
following
but
its
not
something
i
liked
a
lot
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
can
get
a
lot
better
stouts
out
there
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
buy
it
just
to
have
it
on
hand
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
small
tan
head
has
wonderful
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
aromas
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
sweet
taste
mixed
with
dark
chocolates
in
comparison
to
other
stouts
from
the
uk
it
gives
off
similar
complexities
with
that
of
samuel
smith
oatmeal
and
imperial
stout
note
that
there
is
a
difference
from
the
cans
and
bottles
the
nitrocans
have
less
bold
flavor
and
more
creaminess
that
works
as
a
session
beer
the
bottle
has
bolder
flavor
that
puts
it
back
in
the
big
leagues
so
in
short
if
there
was
a
scale
of
1
out
of
10
id
put
the
bottles
at
a
strong
8
or
8
12
and
the
cans
at
a
solid
7
o
while
the
flavor
wasnt
quite
as
robust
as
i
hoped
id
love
to
rereview
this
in
its
bottle
form
maybe
the
nitro
stole
a
bit
of
the
flavors
thunder
i
feel
like
there
was
a
potential
here
that
was
somehow
cut
short
all
in
all
though
very
good
indeed
rich
malty
chocolate
and
a
dry
graham
cracker
taste
meld
well
hints
of
coffee
help
to
make
a
delightful
after
dinner
drink
the
feel
needs
to
be
slightly
more
thick
and
viscous
to
make
this
a
true
post
supper
sipper
m
fullbodied
and
creamy
this
one
was
ok
but
just
not
serious
enough
of
a
beer
for
me
way
too
sweet
serving
type
bottle
tasteroasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
a
rather
roasty
finish
a
classic
sessionable
stout
this
is
the
real
deal
and
a
treat
any
time
o
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
chocolate
billing
with
great
taste
and
appearance
while
melting
into
a
wonderful
finish
resembling
an
old
gold
bar
of
cadbury
dark
chocolate
this
beer
offers
a
great
introduction
to
chocolate
lovers
and
a
great
change
of
pace
to
beer
drinkers
a
solid
intro
stout
loaded
with
chocolate
but
a
little
thin
overall
seems
to
lose
more
and
more
as
it
warms
o
one
of
my
favorites
a
very
nice
chocolate
stout
that
lives
up
to
its
name
feels
like
an
indulgence
when
i
drink
it
truthfully
i
have
no
idea
if
it
has
any
more
calories
than
any
other
dark
beer
but
it
feels
like
it
but
then
if
i
was
watching
calories
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
a
double
chocolate
stout
to
begin
with
this
does
has
a
good
chocolate
aroma
and
a
decent
chocolate
flavor
but
its
not
what
i
expected
its
very
light
and
drinkable
it
does
get
slightly
more
interesting
as
it
warms
but
its
still
underwhelming
this
beer
is
completely
opaque
and
black
smells
like
a
nice
marriage
of
dark
chocolate
and
ale
this
beer
transcends
the
chocolate
stereotype
of
a
sweet
chocolate
milk
beer
and
offers
something
truly
unique
which
is
an
almost
marriage
of
great
chocolate
taste
with
a
quality
ale
this
isnt
your
kids
chocolate
stout
notes
of
smoked
roasted
dark
chocolate
the
chocolate
malt
definitely
plays
a
center
role
this
beer
sets
the
bar
for
a
chocolate
beer
overall
always
a
pleasurable
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
highly
recommended
and
great
for
those
looking
to
enjoy
darker
beers
nitrocan
adds
a
great
creaminess
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
i
was
impressed
with
how
chocolaty
the
flavor
was
the
coffee
finish
was
also
a
plus
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
may
be
one
that
i
come
back
to
for
a
session
this
is
really
worth
checking
out
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
sticky
and
lightly

on
the
tongue
wellpriced
well
made
benchmark
for
the
milk
stout
without
sending
anyone
into
diabetic
shock
with
cloying
sweetness
i
should
remember
how
tasty
this
is
more
often
dark
dark
brown
pour
almost
pitch
black
but
not
quite
produces
a
medium
mocha
colored
head
about
1
finger
high
that
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
some
nice
patchy
lacing
outstanding
aroma
semisweet
chocolate
with
just
the
right
hint
of
coffee
takes
a
moment
for
the
carbonation
to
settle
before
the
taste
of
chocolate
hits
the
palate
followed
by
burnt
toast
with
little
bitterness
on
the
end
medium

an
excellent
stout
delicious

a
must
try

a
decent
amount
of
patchy
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
recedes
aroma
smells
of
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
i
dont
know
if
my
senses
were
just
quick
to
acclimate
but
the
aroma
doesnt
seem
nearly
as
present
in
the
glass
as
it
did
right
from
the
bottle
the
front
end
brings
a
heavy
dose
of
roast
with
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
steps
up
in
the
middle
and
lingers
into
the
finish
a
roasty
haze
lingers
well
after
just
enough
hops
are
present
to
lend
some
balance
theres
also
a
touch
of
alcoholic
warmth
that
exceeds
what
its
pedestrian
abv
would
suggest
giving
this
brew
a
bigger
character
than
it
would
otherwise
have
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
style
and
complements
the
flavor
profile
nicely
warming
certainly
does
this
beer
a
favor
as
the
roasted
chocolate
elements
become
deeper
and
more
present
overall
youngs
is
a
very
solid
chocolate
beer
that
offers
some
depth
and
never
becomes
cloying
certainly
worth
having
again
o
a
decent
and
drinkable
stout
but
not
as
much
chocolate
flavor
as
the
name
would
indicate
a
really
tasty
beer
pretty
hard
to
set
down
for
too
long
has
a
good
offsetting
bitterness
to
avoid
the
sugars
taking
over
chocolate
is
somewhat
of
a
complimenting
flavour
rather
than
the
whole
beer
itself
works
pretty
well
certainly
interesting
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
milk
stouts
as
i
tend
to
think
that
theyre
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
but
this
one
just
seems
to
work
very
well
for
once
im
not
scrambling
to
try
to
find
more
in
an
aroma
and
taste
than
chocolate
milk
ive
been
sleeping
on
this
beer
for
too
long
this
is
a
really
nice
and
sessionable
stout
yum
great
beer
poured
from
500ml

nice

quite
impressed
with
this
stout
enjoed
te
maestic
look
of
bottle
as
well
o
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
a
little
monotone
but
still
a
good
beer
also
a
little
too
carbonated
feeling
for
me
i
would
definitely
like
to
see
and
taste
the
difference
in
the
can
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
i
give
it
a
slightly
lower
grade
simply
because
as
a
milksweet
stout
it
has
more
chocolate
to
it
than
the
guidelines
specify
and
not
enough
of
the
dark
roasted
malt
character
that
this
style
should
have
still
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
o
good
beer
rich
flavors
mellow
chocolate
toffee
woody
aromas
balanced
with
the
carbonation
great
look
to
it
kind
of
expensive
but
worth
it
and
rewarding
as
well
recommended
by
me
o
certainly
sessionable
but
leaves
a
yearning
for
more
complexity
o
smooth
and
rich
sweetness
is
perfectly
subtle
a
very
good
stout
not
wowed
by
this
but
it
is
a
solid
dessertnightcap
kind
of
beer
that
will
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
from
time
to
time
for
a
taste
of
heaven
try
it
fused
with
wells
banana
bread
beer
offered
at
dohertys
here
in
ri
it
would
be
interesting
to
produce
this
very
same
classic
but
getting
a
little
more
kinky
and
extreme
the
beer
pours
a
murky
milk
chocolate
with
sheets
of
fine
bubbles
cascading
up
the
glass
and
slowly
turning
the
beer
from
a
milk
chocolate
color
to
a
more
proper
fine
black
almost
like
the
black
of
a
tuxedo
the
head
appears
on
the
beer
at
a
good
finger
and
a
half
width
and
has
no
intentions
of
leaving
it
is
also
the
most
uniform
and
beautiful
head
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
beer
with
deep
tan
coloring
and
a
creamy
buttery
texture
this
beer
is
a
looker
and
most
certainly
a
beauty
in
a
glass
lacing
is
thick
creamy
and
sheetlike
covering
entire
portions
of
my
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
roasty
almost
like
a
well
milked
mocha
coffee
roasted
nuts
play
beside
what
i
assume
are
lactic
sugars
and
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
caress
the
nose
beautifully
the
sugar
does
dominate
the
light
roast
but
they
play
together
perfectly
the
beer
tastes
surprisingly
light
beginning
sweet
with
light
cloying
lactic
sugars
before
pulling
strong
milk
chocolate
as
the
beer
opens
and
eventually
turns
to
dark
chocolate
black
coffee
bitters
and
a
wonderful
hazelnutty
taste
that
marries
the
flavors
perfectly
the
aftertaste
is
of
french
roast
coffee
and
light
chocolate
my
only
complaint
with
the
taste
is
that
it
tastes
almost
watery
at
the
beginning
before
the
flavors
build
and
this
does
sometimes
sit
on
the
tongue
beneath
the
flavors
as
you
sip
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
to
light
in
body
and
creamy
with
no
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
nitrogen
nicely
creates
a
satiny
blanket
with
this
beer
but
it
does
suffer
from
being
a
little
too
thin
overall
this
is
a
tremendous
english
stout
with
superb
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
dark
chocolate
hazelnut
sugar
and
everything
else
it
is
highly
worth
trying
and
though
it
suffers
in
score
due
to
its
initial
weakness
in
body
and
flavor
it
is
a
superb
beer
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
my
favorite
chocolate
beer
so
far
though
rogues
chocolate
stout
does
give
it
a
run
for
its
money
try
this
beer
o
overall
this
beer
would
be
hit
or
miss
with
most
people
its
unlike
any
stout
that
i
have
ever
had
and
id
have
another
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
stout
it
flows
smooth
as
glass
has
just
the
right
amount
of
complexity
and
stays
on
the
tongue
just
long
enough
to
remind
you
it
is
a
stout
but
it
never
seems
to
overpower
itself
i
would
most
certainly
buy
again
and
i
think
it
would
be
fantastic
paired
with
perhaps
spicy
italian
food
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
nostalgic
beers
had
this
at
a
bar
in
sommerville
after
a
day
full
of
drinking
it
was
my
last
beer
of
the
night
and
i
fell
in
love
i
think
i
named
it
dessert
beer
it
came
in
a
can
poured
it
into
a
glass
creamy
rich
flavor
a
little
foamy
full
flavor
to
me
it
had
notes
of
a
chocolate
espresso
it
reminded
me
of
having
a
piece
of
tiramisu
yum
have
it
as
a
romantic
dessert
beer
cant
go
wrong
surprised
when
poured
into
mug
almost
looked
like
milk
at
first
very
dark
almost
black
in
color
less
carbonated
than
i
thought
it
would
be
full
of
chocolate
hints
and
some
nutty
flavor
as
well
i
really
couldnt
even
taste
much
alcohol
very
easy
to
drink
now
i
like
these
beers
some
dont
but
if
your
into
a
dark
stout
i
think
you
will
enjoy
this
excellent
finish
abv
is
still
5
2
so
they
do
a
bit
of
a
kick
but
not
overwhelming
if
you
have
a
few
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
again
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
on
tap
enjoy
dark
brown
near
black
in
colour
one
finger
of
tan
head
good
amount
of
lace
here
as
well
smell
is
full
of
chocolate
and
roast
some
liquorice
coffee
with
more
milky
chocolate
to
end
on
taste
is
also
full
of
chocolate
flavours
ranging
from
bittersweet
to
lightly
sweet
milk
chocolate
roasty
with
some
coffee
flavours
mid
palate
bitterness
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
medium
carbonation
lightmedium
body
reall
a
great
chocolate
stout
nice
amount
of
flavour
with
a
low
abv
that
makes
this
easily
drinkable
an
outstanding
example
of
a
heavy
stout
packed
with
chocolate
nuances
and
malthop
goodness
throughout
ecstasy
in
every
sip
pours
deep
black
with
just
a
bit
of
red
glow
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
nice
layer
of
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
perked
coffee
butter
mild
cocoa
and
sweet
cream
palate
is
smooth
but
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
roast
and
coffee
flavors
with
some
burnt
toast
a
little
sour
chocolate
is
very
subtle
up
front
but
has
a
growing
presense
some
chalky
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
imported
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
a
little
watery
but
still
has
a
nice
thickness
to
it
far
superior
to
a
nitrocan
but
no
where
near
as
its
tap
brethren
would
buy
in
the
future
nice
contrast
between
the
creamy
head
and
dark
body
nice
chocolatey
smell
otherwise
nothing
special
at
all
about
this
over
rated
stout
the
taste
is
thin
and
bitter
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
especially
for
a
stout
the
chocolate
barely
comes
through
and
then
only
as
a
bitter
top
note
meh
surprisingly
light
beer
smooth
creamy
with
brisk
carbonation
not
as
much
chocolate
as
one
would
expect
but
rather
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
this
is
actually
a
pretty
nice
tasting
stout
with
nice
roastiness
incredible
drinkability
and
awesome
bitter
balance
just
the
right
touch
of
sweetness
im
even
getting
a
touch
of
smoke
or
oak
this
beer
not
all
reins
supreme
in
the
sweet
stout
category
but
is
an
awesome
stout
in
the
stout
universe
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
and
one
that
came
rather
out
of
the
blue
i
picked
this
up
at
the
last
second
leaving
the
shop
a
few
weeks
ago
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
was
bursting
with
flavour
and
had
great
balance
this
one
turned
out
to
be
on
of
the
better
stout
i
have
had
i
got
a
22oz
glass
of
this
at
hollywood
stadium
inside
hollywood
casino
in
joliet
il
this
pours
as
black
as
can
be
with
a
light
brown
head
it
smells
of
robust
malts
and
sweet
chocolate
the
texture
is
like
most
english
beers
very
light
and
full
of
air
to
the
point
it
drinks
lighter
than
water
the
taste
of
course
is
full
complex
sweet
and
robust
this
beer
is
quite
renowned
but
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
had
a
little
heavier
texture
to
it
drinks
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
chalky
after
taste
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
is
widely
available
o
the
chocolate
is
such
a
good
flavor
in
this
minus
the
booze
of
the
nose
and
with
a
touch
more
body
and
bubbles
this
could
be
a
perfect
beer
makes
for
a
very
nice
dessert
as
is
though
o
4
0
between
the
charforwardness
the
notverysweet
chocolate
note
and
the
thin
chalky
crispness
this
is
a
totally
different
beer
than
the
thicker
round
mild
sweet
chocolate
confection
i
was
expecting
from
and
english
beer
called
a
double
chocolate
stout
im
glad
it
turned
out
this
way
instead
though
its
a
good
one
almost
sessionable
and
full
of
robust
flavor
id
give
it
about
a
3
9
in
the
overall
category
if
i
could
rjt
o
this
is
a
rock
solid
dessert
beer
with
enough
balance
to
make
it
a
bit
more
versatile
than
one
would
expect
i
expected
more
honestly
but
thats
because
i
wanted
choklat
jr
instead
of
something
with
more
nuance
and
subtlety
o
always
superb
not
too
heavy
never
too
light
great
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
nearblack
coloring
with
a
thin
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
that
coats
the
top
of
the
beer
and
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
with
a
deep
roasting
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
highlighting
flavors
are
rich
and
deeply
roasted
with
a
light
dry
body
typical
of
a
milk
stout
smooth
rich
creamy
milk
chocolate
flavors
on
the
forward
tongue
are
followed
rapidly
by
a
touch
of
bitter
dark
cocoa
nibs
underlying
flavor
profile
very
dynamic
whilst
remaining
in
the
realm
of
chocolate
throughout
a
hint
of
coffeemocha
comes
in
as
the
transition
is
being
made
to
the
aftertaste
on
the
palate
which
is
mostly
the
dark
roast
and
slight
bitterness
smooth
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
roast
linger
very
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
have
found
that
this
beer
does
well
transitioning
newbies
into
the
world
of
the
stout
a
classic
and
for
good
reason
o
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
though
i
dont
particularly
like
dark
chocolate
which
is
basically
the
only
flavor
o
my
absolute
favorite
nitro
beer
to
date
lots
more
character
than
other
nitro
stouts
great
chocolate
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
drank
four
pints
in
a
row
so
dont
give
me
that
its
too
heavy
its
perfectly
drinkable
cheers
lampertland
overall
an
awesome
chocolate
stout
fact
that
i
got
it
in
a
growler
adds
to
my
enjoyment
greatly
tastier
than
the
bottle
even
if
also
thinner
bravo
overall
i
always
pick
this
one
up
at
the
local
liquor
store
its
very
good
and
i
recommend
this
good
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
just
feels
like
pure
chocolatey
goodness
with
some
coffee
to
boot
the
only
reason
im
reluctant
to
give
it
5s
across
the
board
is
one
that
echos
another
review
from
a
fellow
advocate
its
not
that
chocolaty
appearance
wise
its
a
stout
so
its
dark
really
dark
but
the
thin
brown
head
gives
it
a
pleasant
appearance
the
smell
plays
a
huge
role
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
if
that
doesnt
sound
strange
and
the
taste
is
very
roasted
and
chicory
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
dont
get
me
wrong
its
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
drank
but
its
not
a
double
chocolate
kind
of
stout
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
though
o
good
stout
with
a
load
of
really
dark
malts
the
chocolate
tends
to
be
rather
low
in
the
taste
not
as
sweet
and
chocolatey
as
the
smell
would
suggest
very
smooth
and
silky
not
a
knockout
flavorwise
but
still
extremely
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
understated
you
get
more
of
the
coffee
roastiness
i
like
the
way
the
chocolate
is
there
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
there
is
very
good
balance
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
stouts
that
i
have
ever
had
o
terrific
nitro
canned
beer
like
dessert
in
a
glass
i
paired
this
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
and
they
went
really
well
together
overall
exceptional
beer
would
be
amazing
with
some
sort
of
chocolate
or
coffee
dessert
note
13
times
if
you
count
chocolaty
o
its
alright
if
you
like
silky
smooth
stout
you
cant
go
far
wrong
with
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
offering
in
the
milksweet
stout
category
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
nitro
not
from
the
tap
actually
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
nitro
can
or
bottle
behind
left
hand
nitro
milk
stout
which
is
now
my
all
time
favorite
and
go
to
for
smoothness
easy
drinking
or
nitro
overall
very
enjoyable
chocolate
stout
i
just
bought
a
bottle
of
youngs
chocolate
stout
from
a
pharmacytype
store
and
poured
it
at
about
30
degrees
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
though
not
particularly
strong
chocolatey
smell
it
looks
pitchblack
like
youd
expect
the
mouthfeel
seems
less
creamy
than
youd
might
expect
which
i
like
it
tastes
great
not
too
chocolatey
overall
id
give
this
a
4
5
because
i
think
itd
be
better
with
a
stronger
smell
and
taste
its
the
best
stout
ive
tried
thus
far
only
had
around
810
brands
highly
recommended
o
very
good
beer
that
is
readily
available
near
me
i
had
this
several
times
but
finally
get
to
review
it
the
combination
of
roasted
malt
modest
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
make
for
a
fairly
easy
drinking
6
5
offering
overall
this
is
a
tasty
little
milk
stout
double
chocolate
suggest
something
biggermore
flavorful
than
this
beer
actually
is
but
you
wont
regret
buying
this
lovely
rich
tan
brown
one
finger
light
cream
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
little
lacing
faint
yeast
and
sweet
meaty
smell
gingery
sweet
overtones
with
light
carbonation
that
lasts
toasted
chocolate
flavor
lingers
smooth
great
beer
that
holds
up
well
on
its
own
and
accompanying
a
pork
stew
came
to
the
table
a
solid
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
sticky
lace
smells
of
bitter
roast
dark
chocolate
chocolate
syrup
caramel
and
earth
and
minerals
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
quite
well
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
the
dark
chocolate
and
chocolate
syrup
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
oily
mouthfeel
ive
had
this
quite
a
few
times
and
im
surprised
i
havent
rated
it
before
now
i
remember
more
chocolate
from
the
bottle
but
i
could
be
misremembering
it
is
good
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
good
example
of
light
abv
stout
odto
stress
simplicity
this
beer
is
akin
to
a
chocolate
infused
guinness
draught
light
bodied
stout
that
can
fill
a
role
in
certain
situations
took
me
too
long
to
try
this
overall
all
i
can
say
is
that
may
be
it
didnt
hold
up
well
in
the
trip
to
australia
poured
from
tap
in
a
guinness
pint
glass
poured
opaque
almost
black
with
brown
highlights
head
was
foamy
khaki
colored
and
stuck
around
leaving
some
fine
lacing
when
it
finally
went
away
nose
was
roasted
malt
coffee
and
sugary
chocolate
the
taste
was
almost
chocolate
milk
sweet
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
there
for
a
complement
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
creamy
but
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
bordered
on
watery
overall
very
good
and
tasty
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
a
bottle
because
i
feel
like
the
nitro
can
is
holding
it
back
in
smell
and
taste
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
milk
stout
would
have
brought
it
sooner
pours
black
the
best
color
a
smooth
taste
that
not
that
sweet
for
some
reason
i
thought
it
suppose
to
look
like
chocolate
milk
but
doesnt
its
dark
so
another
wonderful
dark
beer
sit
back
and
enjoy
othis
is
a
nice
beer
very
good
for
the
price
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
stout
but
definitely
not
getting
the
double
chocolate
in
it
overall
excellent
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
everything
i
wanted
it
to
be
plus
a
little
more
highly
recommended
would
absolutely
drink
and
buy
this
again
i
paired
it
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
with
chocolate
topping
and
ghiradelli
and
it
was
amazing
you
gotta
get
your
hands
on
this
one
i
cant
say
im
all
that
familiar
with
milksweet
stouts
but
this
seems
pretty
darn
good
to
me
it
pours
almost
exactly
the
same
colour
as
coke
except
much
thicker
despite
this
it
still
looks
quite
good
the
head
is
almost
medium
brown
quite
dark
actually
im
sure
anyone
can
guess
what
this
one
smells
like
chocolate
plus
the
normal
stout
malty
goodness
the
taste
isnt
sweet
thank
god
but
it
does
definitely
have
a
hint
of
chocolate
along
with
a
bit
of
coffee
molasses
and
malts
very
dry
finish
overall
great
beer
d
like
an
average
stout
but
neutered
ill
admit
im
both
a
sucker
for
sweets
as
well
as
most
highly
regarded
beers
here
on
ba
but
this
was
pretty
much
underwhelming
by
all
accounts
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
six
pack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
virginia
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
good
sized
creamy
white
head
smells
of
a
normal
stout
not
as
much
of
a
chocolate
smell
as
the
name
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
still
pleasant
tastes
of
a
weak
stout
but
with
a
chocolate
overtone
which
is
very
tasty
smooth
finish
for
this
light
bodied
beer
perfect
carbonation
overall
above
average
beer
o
a
really
nice
chocolate
stout
very
rich
and
tasty
with
just
enough
extra
going
on
to
prevent
it
from
being
totally
straightforward
poured
from
a
nitro
can
beautifully
the
pour
is
so
sexy
you
cant
wait
to
sample
it
its
a
jet
black
with
a
lighter
tan
head
the
nose
is
all
chocolate
the
taste
is
all
chocolate
theres
not
much
more
to
say
than
that
its
a
fairly
regular
stout
with
an
extra
dose
of
chocolate
combined
with
some
nitro
so
the
pour
and
mouth
feel
are
rather
creamy
would
i
get
this
again
depends
may
just
stick
with
chocolate
milk
much
cheaper
hehe
but
this
was
very
cool
this
is
a
pretty
good
stoutvery
smooth
and
flavourfull
o
this
is
a
superb
stout
im
very
impressed
especially
for
the
fact
that
i
was
looking
for
a
milksweet
stout
for
a
cupcake
recipe
that
my
wife
was
asking
about
and
wasnt
necessarily
looking
for
this
though
i
was
looking
for
something
else
and
decided
to
go
with
this
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
tasting
those
cupcakes
soon
this
is
a
top
of
the
notch
brew
i
cant
wait
to
have
again

extremely
well

with
pretty
much
no
warming
noticed
on
the

overall
this
is
a
delicious
nitro
stout
no
real
complexity
present
but
it
is
extremely
enjoyable
and
smooth
very
straightforward
tasting
as
advertised
in
the
name
its
definitely
a
classic
example
of
a
milk
stout
that
brings
the
chocolate
overall
the
nitrogen
pour
fits
this
beer
perfectly
and
i
would
always
recommend
it
over
the
nonnitro
version
great
flavors
and
smooth
body
make
it
a
great
drinking
experience
delicious
and
smooth
wonderful
overall
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
a
good
way
to
get
a
sweet
stout
fix
though
as
it
is
easier
to
find
than
most
milksweet
stouts
i
feel
like
nitro
is
a
good
application
here
even
though
i
cant
tell
you
for
sure
what
it
is
like
without
it
overall
a
great
stout
o
definitely
enjoyed
this
maybe
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
full
of
real
chocolate
flavour
and
actually
quite
refreshing
wich
is
nice
to
be
found
in
a
stout
felt
a
bit
heavy
on
my
stomach
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
smell
and
a
great
flavor
with
such
a
smooth
mouthfeel
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoy
it
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
and
the
nitrocan
is
my
favorite
format
i
drink
it
at
lots
of
family
evenets
as
it
is
my
motherinlaws
favorite
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
chocolate
beer
that
i
have
tried
i
am
very
glad
i
discovered
this
at
the
local
grocery
o
my
girl
friend
picked
this
one
out
from
the
store
and
wanted
to
try
somthing
with
chocolate
in
it
i
am
a
fan
of
the
youngs
brand
and
had
a
feeling
i
would
not
be
disappointed
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
one
after
the
other
the
chocolate
taste
was
unmistakeable
and
along
with
some
roasted
hints
and
very
mild
bitterness
there
was
not
too
much
of
a
coffee
flavor
found
in
so
many
stouts
i
do
not
drink
this
style
much
but
was
a
pleasant
beer
that
i
would
try
again
this
is
a
fine
stout
id
take
it
over
guinness
any
day
but
its
nothing
too
much
to
write
home
about
o
not
awful
but
by
no
means
good
if
offered
one
i
would
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
this
was
my
first
chocolate
stout
and
id
like
to
try
more
before
i
form
any
opinions
on
this
style
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
good
stout
beer
for
a
first
one
it
was
enjoyable
by
all
in
the
room
as
everyone
i
was
with
5
of
them
said
it
was
the
best
dark
beer
they
ever
tried
it
was
sweet
not
overpowering
on
the
abv
and
could
be
enjoyed
by
sipping
or
gulping
it
down
i
would
happily
buy
this
beer
again
for
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
or
pair
it
with
a
good
thick
bacon
burger
or
a
steak
a
very
nice
beer
chocolatey
rich
and
full
just
like
i
like
stouts
a
tad
carbonated
for
my
taste
4
0
mouthfeel
but
im
starting
to
think
that
i
just
dislike
carbonation
more
than
your
average
drinker
ill
definitely
have
this
one
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it

it

as
promised
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
milk
stout
it
had
just
enough
chocolate
flavors
to
stay
true
to
its
name
and
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
really
put
this
beer
over
the
top
this
beer
had
really
good
drinkability
it
went
down
really
smooth
wasnt
too
filling
and
the
taste
really
held
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
without
getting
bored
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
they
were
about
as
good
as
gets
for
this
style
of
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
flavor
wasnt
as
chocolaty
as
the
aroma
was
it
wasnt
a
big
deal
but
if
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
it
would
be
perfect
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
too
expensive
and
is
a
real
nice
representation
of
a
proper
chocolate
stout
even
if
you
remotely
like
chocolate
stouts
this
is
worth
a
try
and
is
a
true
representation
of
the
style
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
have
passed
this
beer
up
many
times
mainly
because
its
so
available
but
after
trying
it
i
for
sure
wont
be
passing
it
up
again
i
think
some
brewers
need
to
drink
this
beer
to
know
what
a
true
chocolate
stout
should
taste
like
lately
i
have
had
a
few
that
have
not
been
that
chocolaty
when
you
claim
your
beer
is
a
chocolate
stout
the
chocolate
should
be
the
main
focus
and
thats
exactly
what
is
was
with
this
beer
and
thats
what
makes
this
beer
so
special
lately
i
havent
had
great
luck
with
english
beers
but
this
beer
broke
the
trend
and
reaffirmed
to
me
that
there
are
some
great
beers
coming
out
of
that
country
this
has
to
be
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
ever
had
a
new
favorite
and
it
made
for
a
good
first
impression
of
this
brewery
this
may
finally
inspire
me
to
bite
the
bullet
and
try
that
banana
bread
beer
good
job
guys
this
is
one
great
beer
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
has
a
great
taste
very
enjoyable
the
beer
sounds
thick
sweet
and
syrupy
but
it
is
rather
smooth
clean
and
mediumbodied
i
could
gush
about
this
thing
all
day
but
i
should
really
just
not
and
crack
open
a
new
one
instead
if
you
like
stouts
like
me
you
will
love
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
it
has
the
stout
part
and
doesnt
have
the
coffee
like
part
to
it
also
i
have
tried
many
chocolate
stouts
and
they
are
just
too
coffee
like
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
has
great
great
hints
of
chocolate
and
stout
nothign
else
but
its
not
too
much
chocolate
to
tolerate
if
you
like
stouts
i
recommend
this
one
id
give
it
an
a
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brownblack
with
the
traditional
nitro
cascade
and
foam
i
dont
really
get
much
aroma
its
a
very
light
milk
chocolate
taste
is
primarily
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
malt
more
milky
at
first
then
darker
as
it
warms
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
nice
beer
somewhat
one
dimensional
chocolate
thick
two
finger
head
on
a
dark
black
body
with
a
little
light
passing
through
nice
lacing
aroma
is
robust
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
a
nicely
represented
chocolate
aroma
flavor
is
similar
with
a
stronger
coffee
bitterness
mostly
in
the
finish
thickening
and
thick
bodied
one
could
drink
this
nonstop
with
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
o
as
mentioned
i
have
wonderful
memories
of
this
beer
and
must
thank
it
for
assisting
in
my
palate
development
thus
the
perfect
score
for
the
overall
rating
i
even
bought
a
couple
of
cases
of
this
and
had
it
as
a
side
beer
at
my
wedding
back
in
2009
a
solid
beer
allaround
that
is
so
smooth
and
well
balanced
you
cant
help
but
enjoy
it
no
matter
what
time
of
the
year
it
is
overall
a
solid
milk
stout
d
its
a
really
good
stout
but
i
find
it
to
be
just
too
mild
to
be
great
with
a
little
work
it
could
be
world
class
o
good
it
was
enjoyable
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
something
i
would
rant
and
rave
about
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
everyone
amazing
brew
and
i
am
ashamed
that
i
had
waited
to
try
it
the
beer
appears
dark
brown
nearing
blackness
the
tan
head
is
enormous
encompassing
the
upper
half
of
the
pint
glass
leaving
a
thick
sheet
of
lacing
stuck
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
straightforward
with
chocolate
malt
leading
the
way
followed
by
hints
of
vanilla
the
flavor
also
delivers
a
healthy
amount
of
chocolate
as
promised
a
nice
roast
character
is
present
throughout
and
pleasantly
lingers
in
the
finish
the
body
is
pretty
thin
bordering
on
watery
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
well
suited
for
one
who
enjoys
both
chocolate
and
beer
best
is
smaller
quantities
i
enjoy
returning
to
this
beer
on
occasion
overall
a
very
sweet
and
tasty
beer
that
i
would
happily
buy
again
m
silky
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
slick
and
viscous
foundation
and
some
medium
carbonation
dry
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
sessionable
stout
i
dont
think
it
would
be
my
first
chocolate
stout
choice
but
it
wouldnt
be
too
far
behind
in
the
pack
o
not
something
i
buy
often
but
if
i
see
this
while
out
and
looking
for
something
like
this
its
something
i
have
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
many
times
poured
a
beautiful
inky
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
just
gorgeous
to
look
at
the
scent
is
subdued
chocolate
and
cocoa
and
the
taste
follows
the
scent
this
is
more
subdued
than
i
would
expect
given
its
appearance
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
the
mouth
feel
is
cream
goodness
overall
a
very
pleasurable
experience
would
have
rated
it
higher
if
the
taste
match
the
gorgeous
appearance
a
smooth
and
solid
black
appearance
with
a
4
inch
beige
head
its
got
a
strong
chocolate
milk
laced
with
alcohol
aroma
which
would
be
a
lot
nicer
if
the
alcohol
level
was
lowered
initial
taste
is
of
chocolate
milk
and
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
some
roasted
coffee
flavor
follow
and
lingers
in
the
after
taste
i
much
prefer
the
second
half
of
this
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
just
as
one
should
expect
from
a
nitro
can
overall
the
strong
alcohol
presence
in
this
one
severely
limits
its
potential
for
me
i
know
i
should
like
it
everyone
else
seems
to
but
i
just
do
not
get
what
everyone
else
is
getting
had
it
a
couple
times
and
each
experience
has
been
the
same
whether
in
the
can
or
om
tap
overall
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
great
chocolate
stout
3
5
d
admittedly
one
of
the
better
nitro
beers
out
there
but
its
still
a
nitro
beer
and
thus
the
nose
and
taste
take
huge
hits
not
too
impressed
with
the
nitro
version
of
this
beer
it
shines
in
some
areas
and
lacks
in
others
average
overall
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
bottled
version
not
real
sure
what
everyone
sees
in
this
one
if
this
is
double
chocolate
im
scared
to
see
what
the
single
version
is
it
honestly
tastes
like
guinness
with
double
the
dark
chocolate
same
body
same
feel
really
forgot
to
add
the
milk
part
of
the
milk
stout
o
it
was
what
i
had
expected
chocolate
from
the
nose
to
the
tongue
it
was
there
all
the
way
right
where
i
wanted
it
very
nice
overall
a
very
good
chocolate
stout
it
is
chocolate
not
just
in
name
but
in
practice
o
a
really
good
beer
that
isnt
super
expensive
like
a
lot
of
premium
stouts
tend
to
be
very
solid
beer
that
id
reccomend
to
anyone
who
likes
sweet
beers
oflavors
are
good
and
fairly
well
balanced
just
not
a
lot
there
o
this
beer
looked
fantastic
but
the
nose
and
flavor
were
too
mild
and
the
beer
wasnt
creamy
enough
in
my
opinion
its
a
tie
between
this
and
cocoa
loco
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
this
one
didnt
have
more
dominant
chocolate
flavors
the
chocolate
that
was
there
was
very
dark
and
good
just
wish
there
was
more
of
it
a
pretty
pour
intriguing
and
pleasant
aroma
decent
taste
but
then
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
watery
finish
in
the
mouthfeel
is
so
drastic
it
affects
the
taste
if
you
can
get
this
fresh
it
is
the
best
chocolate
stout
if
you
get
an
old
one
its
still
ok
but
with
that
said
i
am
tried
of
places
over
charging
or
having
old
ones
in
stock
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
bev
mo
or
a
grocery
store
go
for
it
if
it
is
at
a
ghetto
liquor
store
please
pass
beer
knowledge
o
i
have
had
this
before
and
remember
it
being
better
wonder
if
i
did
myself
a
disservice
by
getting
the
nitro
can
overall
an
excellent
stout
strong
flavors
with
very
slight
bitterness
a
surprisingly
well
balanced
stout
of
high
quality
and
fun
experimentation
not
as
chocolaty
as
i
expected
it
to
be
but
definitely
a
good
brew
recipe
any
fans
of
stouts
should
try
this
one
especially
since
its
nearly
seassionable
likewise
despite
the
slight
changes
i
note
from
my
impressions
of
past
samplings
and
i
now
see
that
ive
reviewed
this
on
nitro
as
well
it
basically
hasnt
changed
i
recall
selling
several
caseloads
of
this
per
week
at
retail
and
just
because
im
not
so
impressed
with
it
doesnt
mean
that
others
are
not
pours
jet
black
into
a
stout
glass
with
a
2
inch
or
more
tan
lacey
head
smells
heavenly
dark
chocolate
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
milk
candy
creamy
feel
flavor
is
great
very
very
chocolatey
but
not
gimmicky
its
incorportaed
into
the
beer
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
amazed
because
i
was
expecting
a
double
stout
strong
but
what
i
got
was
a
double
chocolate
beer
which
caught
me
off
guard
in
a
good
way
there
is
also
a
gentle
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
is
a
nice
contrast
with
the
candy
sweetness
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
syrupy
for
me
not
as
carbonated
as
i
usually
like
in
these
beers
but
i
always
go
back
to
this
i
find
it
much
better
in
the
nitro
can
than
the
bottle
too
overall
well
put
together
easy
to
drink
and
above
all
pretty
damn
good
might
be
little
sweet
but
this
isnt
a
soda
i
would
better
classify
it
as
a
lighter
porter
regardless
hope
you
all
enjoy
cheers
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
and
the
truth
is
i
like
it
more
than
the
can
which
is
perfect
this
is
a
perfect
holiday
stout
im
reviewing
this
on
boxing
day
and
if
you
like
stouts
then
this
is
almost
flawless
in
my
opinion
even
the
artwork
on
the
label
looks
like
something
from
willy
wonka
amazing
overall
a
nice
chocolatey
stout
maybe
better
than
rogue
chocolate
stout
overall
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
and
full
of
nice
flavors
this
should
be
a
crowd
pleaser
pours
an
almost
jet
black
colour
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
thick
dense
two
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
smells
heavily
of
barley
and
chocolate
bit
of
cream
and
coffee
as
well
tastes
heavily
of
chocolate
some
licorice
tad
of
dairy
and
big
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
thick
dense
and
creamy
medium
carbonation
overall
a
beautiful
stout
this
is
a
fantastic
chocolatesweet
stout
and
probably
the
best
one
i
have
ever
had
i
almost
always
snag
a
bottle
of
this
when
i
see
it
for
sale
i
always
enjoy
it
and
it
is
consistently
delicious
watery
thinnish
body
some
creaminess
from
the
nitro
still
fairly
flavorful
though
hershey
kiss
milk
chocolate
mild
coffee
with
cream
and
sugar
somewhat
sweet
though
not
overly
so
some
mellow
roastiness
though
overall
its
a
bit
flabby
and
watery
wheres
the
bitterness
wheres
the
body
not
something
id
revisit
more
of
a
novelty
due
to
the
can
overall
this
is
just
a
very
good
beer
on
tap
it
seems
to
have
more
chocolate
but
its
still
great
from
the
nitrocan
drink
overall
a
really
tasty
and
flavorful
chocolate
stout
has
a
good
profile
with
smooth
flavors
id
come
back
to
this
one
with
a
dessert
overall
wells
young
ltd
really
nailed
this
style
what
a
great
sessionable
stout
i
could
easily
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
much
better
than
guinness
in
every
way
ive
had
it
on
nitrotap
nitrocan
and
in
the
bottle
on
tap
and
from
the
nitrocan
is
the
way
to
go
much
better
than
the
bottle
version
enjoy
been
drinking
this
beer
forever
and
finally
decided
to
sit
down
and
review
it
dark
blackbrown
pour
with
two
finger
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
as
you
would
expect
lots
of
roasty
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
in
the
nose
along
with
hints
of
espresso
vanilla
and
caramel
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
chocolate
definitely
the
star
but
not
to
the
point
to
where
its
too
much
the
roasted
malt
becomes
even
more
prominent
as
it
warms
with
an
almost
smokey
hint
to
it
reminds
me
when
i
toured
the
old
ram
brewery
outside
of
london
and
they
had
us
taste
the
roasted
barley
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
and
oh
so
smooth
that
coupled
with
the
low
abv
makes
this
incredibly
drinkable
a
classic
and
dependable
beer
the
beer
is
super
creamy
and
is
desert
like
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
move
noncraft
drinkers
into
that
direction
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
not
thick
and
mouthcoating
which
makes
this
highly
drinkable
and
enough
roastiness
to
be
refreshing
and
nearly
palate
cleansing
the
5
2
abv
also
makes
this
one
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
o
overall
a
nice
blend
quite
inoffensive
pretty
nice
im
not
a
stout
fan
but
this
one
is
alright
o
very
disappointing
i
remember
having
one
of
these
on
tap
and
enjoying
it
immensely
and
after
pouring
this
beer
and
taking
a
whiff
i
thought
it
would
live
up
to
my
memories
but
the
first
sip
was
an
immediate
letdown
and
it
didnt
get
any
better
i
didnt
even
bother
to
finish
this
one
im
hoping
it
was
just
a
bad
batch
it
wasnt
even
in
my
fridge
that
long
dr
they
should
just
brew
a
cream
ale
and
be
done
with
it
the
emphasis
here
isnt
on
the
chocolate
contrary
to
the
epithet
very
drinkable
but
also
quite
forgettable
at
least
out
of
the
nitrocan
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
again
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
very
smooth
and
delicious
a
good
desert
beer
nice
looking
pour
with
a
giant
head
classic
black
and
tan
aroma
is
a
faint
smell
of
chocolate
milk
taste
of
bitter
chocolate
powder
with
coffee
tones
and
chicory
mineral
presence
is
evident
in
the
hard
water
metallic
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
mouth
is
creamy
and
thin
overall
a
decent
example
of
a
milk
stout
although
this
could
be
sweeter
and
heavier
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
nothing
really
offensive
or
outstanding
but
a
good
stout
and
great
value
love
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
this
one
howeverits
positively
silken
almost
worth
drinking
just
for
that
and
for
watching
the
pretty
picture
that
unfolds
when
you
pour
it
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
much
more
often
in
the
future
a
new
favorite
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
with
a
subtle
hint
of
cocoa
flavouring
with
prominent
notes
of
malty
caramel
and
coffee
it
has
a
thick
creamy
mouth
feel
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
sweetness
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
friends
who
wouldnt
normally
appreciate
beer
the
stout
came
out
in
a
normal
pint
glass
with
a
two
finger
dense
and
medium
tan
head
it
smells
of
you
guessed
it
chocolate
some
coffee
toffee
and
roasted
malts
hops
arent
overly
present
in
the
overall
taste
main
tastes
are
chocolate
and
coffee
its
a
fairly
sweet
beer
with
a
pretty
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
like
it
should
be
i
definitely
need
to
get
this
again
as
im
fairly
new
to
the
craft
brew
world
im
not
as
up
on
my
beer
lingo
as
most
of
the
reviewers
on
this
site
thank
you
in
advance
for
my
unprofessionalism
i
do
know
what
smells
and
tastes
good
to
me
i
am
a
chocoholic
and
have
tried
just
about
every
well
reviewed
chocolate
oatmeal
and
milk
stout
on
this
site
as
i
understand
this
is
the
macro
brew
of
the
bunch
sometimes
things
are
more
popular
for
a
reason
this
is
the
case
here
this
beer
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
sweet
without
being
overbearing
the
double
chocolate
is
certainly
not
just
a
market
tool
i
prefer
beers
of
this
style
to
have
low
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
its
the
nitro
can
or
not
but
this
is
very
low
carbonation
has
a
very
cool
guinness
cascading
effect
when
poured
allowing
the
beer
to
warm
a
little
does
great
things
for
both
the
taste
and
smell
exactly
the
beer
i
hoped
to
find
for
the
style
nice
little
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
malty
bitterness
to
offset
the
overwhelming
milk
chocolate
o
nothing
crazy
going
on
here
just
a
solid
milk
stout
with
lots
of
chocolate
whats
not
to
like
with
that
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
actually
wasnt
as
chocolaty
as
i
expected
but
still
good
nonetheless
overall
an
excellent
stout
notably
in
flavor
and
appearance
a
definite
buyagain
do
drinkability
is
moderate
while
the
look
and
smell
are
nice
on
this
the
taste
and
body
are
lacking
i
have
had
this
beer
a
good
amount
of
times
in
bottles
and
this
is
my
first
nitrocan
so
i
am
not
sure
if
my
memory
of
this
beer
is
skewed
or
the
different
vessel
but
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
out
of
a
bottle
to
refresh
myself
overall
this
is
a
good
chocolate
stout
but
not
the
best
ive
had
it
lacks
complexity
just
a
little
boring
it
was
wonderful
like
an
unsweetened
chocolate
phosphate
this
is
what
i
thought
guinness
would
taste
like
the
first
time
i
tried
it
holy
chocolate
cow
this
beer
is
the
frickin
bomb
i
expect
to
gain
weight
exponentially
in
the
near
future
thank
you
wells
young
fabulous
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
nice
alternative
to
guinness
when
it
comes
to
nitro
stouts
o
a
good
beer
does
everything
well
o
very
tasty
stout
without
some
of
the
roasted
bitterness
seen
in
other
stouts
good
choice
for
someone
who
may
not
be
totally
keen
on
that
type
of
beer
nitrocan
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nitro
is
a
novelty
and
gives
the
appearance
a
boost
nice
blackopaque
pour
with
lots
of
action
leading
to
a
1
finger
tan
head
some
lacing
remains
smell
is
rather
mild
some
coffee
notes
mixed
with
light
chocolate
underwhelming
however
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
i
hoped
a
bit
of
watered
down
chocolate
but
smooth
a
bit
one
dimentional
didnt
pick
up
any
malts
and
just
mild
milky
quality
feels
a
bit
watery
on
the
tongue
as
well
wanted
more
of
a
creamysilk
feel
overall
a
decent
stout
that
was
good
but
not
great
needs
to
be
more
complex
with
fuller
body
and
taste
perhaps
the
nitro
zapped
the
taste
i
really
had
no
real
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
was
surprisingly
good
bad
can
is
it
cause
of
the
nitro
i
dunno
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
drink
it
tasted
as
if
it
had
a
powdery
chocolate
taste
baking
chocolate
this
time
around
its
still
good
but
still
not
great
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
drink
but
its
still
definitely
worth
trying
pours
an
enchanting
multicolored
lively
celebration

bubbles

foam

but
relatively
inviting
cocoa
powderish
taste
cocoa
powder
bitter
chocolate
touch
of
alcohol
sucked
from
inside
a
liqueured
chocolate
novelty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
a
big
letdown
from
how
it
looks
much
better
as
it
warms
good
but
that
wateriness
is
a
huge
detractor
from
its
better
qualities
pours
a
dark
opaque
brownblack
with
a
solid
finger
of
tightly
laced
foam
sitting
atop
theres
a
sweet
chocolaty
aroma
obviously
but
im
also
picking
up
something
akin
to
the
smell
of
stale
burnt
coffee
if
i
wasnt
concentrating
i
would
have
never
noticed
it
and
its
not
present
enough
to
be
off
putting
but
its
not
the
welcoming
roasty
coffee
and
espresso
notes
i
associate
with
a
stout
especially
one
i
enjoy
so
much
interestingly
enough
i
dont
pick
up
on
the
bitter
coffee
when
i
drink
it
only
the
chocolate
sweetness
thats
smooth
and
sippable
without
being
overpoweringly
strong
dessert
has
been
poured
benchmark
for
chocolate
stout
i
dont
think
i
would
order
this
one
again
however
i
wouldnt
discourage
anyone
from
trying
it
i
expected
a
little
more
sweetness
but
that
is
my
fault
not
the
beers
good
beer
o
a
real
treat
dont
drink
many
but
always
enjoy
them
when
i
do
stouts
are
in
my
top
5
style
choices
but
youngs
isnt
going
to
make
my
top
5
stouts
it
isnt
hatable
but
not
lovable

hadnt
had

for
almost

after

it

felt
like
not
ordinary

at

end
of
the

i
felt
little
tired
of
that
coffeechocolate
tandem
all
in
all
this
ale
is
great
and
worth
your
try
on
it
overall
this
is
amazing
you
must
try
this
if
you
havent
yet
its
special
light
in
body
with
a
nice
full
flavor
of
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
dark
roasted
malts
give
it
a
good
baseline
for
the
chocolate
malt
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
to
come
out
and
shine
they
give
it
a
creamy
sweetness
that
is
somehow
refreshing
in
feel
a
light
touch
of
coffee
or
hop
bitterness
resides
in
the
back
and
tingles
a
little
giving
it
a
crisp
finish
that
actually
does
really
well
with
this
style
creamy
in
feel
but
with
a
higher
carbonation
level
that
increases
drinkability
which
is
very
also
high
for
this
beer
at
5
2
it
would
be
extremely
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
very
nice
little
beer
probably
will
be
back
for
more
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
stout
o
one
of
the
finest
examples
in
the
stout
class
in
my
not
very
humble
opinion
o
although
with
all
the
pros
it
falls
slightly
flat
though
it
feels
a
bit
on
the
basic
side
but
its
very
very
tasty
and
anybody
who
enjoys
milk
stouts
will
love
this
one
overall
i
wouldnt
say
it
beats
the
nitrocan
or
if
you
can
get
it
the
nitrotap
but
its
definitely
still
got
some
spunk
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
but
not
quite
as
smooth
as
i
had
hoped
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
a
nice
milk
stout
not
too
sweet
like
these
usually
are
for
me
very
enjoyable
to
drink
on
a
cool
evening
does
not
have
a
chocolate
scent
more
caramel
instead
pours
opaque
brownblack
with
good
beige
head
laces
the
glass
well
taste
does
seem
to
be
a
dark
bitter
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
nice
bite
in
the
aftertaste
improves
as
it
warms
overall
an
awesome
beer
for
my
first
stout
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
beer
chocolate
or
both
i
certainly
could
not
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
this
beer
is
a
style
benchmark
but
will
remain
only
a
occasional
beer
for
me
my
opinion
on
this
beer
is
it
was
served
way
too
cold
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
think
where
i
was
served
it
must
have
been
on
ice
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
aroma
and
just
a
hint
of
the
chocolate
flavor
it
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
i
will
review
again
once
i
let
one
warm
up
a
bit
d
love
the
dark
chocolate
element
here
very
nicely
done
the
drinkability
is
good
and
works
perfect
as
a
dessert
beer
overall
its
a
great
brew
overall
this
is
by
far
the
smoothest
beer
ive
had
personally
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
although
i
definitely
prefer
the
bottle
over
the
can
as
far
as
taste
goes
the
can
kicks
ass
in
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
though
so
i
think
the
ultimate
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
would
be
one
with
the
taste
of
the
bottled
version
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
appearance
and
nose
of
the
nitrocan
version
either
way
you
cut
it
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
certainly
worthy
of
a
comparison
between
the
versions
i
cant
believe
how
different
the
two
beers
areits
hard
to
believe
they
are
the
same
beer
i
would
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
out
this
beer
on
tapnitrotap
as
well
to
compare
with
these
versions
all
in
all
a
superb
brew
if
they
made
a
bottle
conditioned
version
i
would
be
in
heaven
and
probably
buy
my
dad
a
case
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
but
always
a
bit
odd
coming
out
of
a
nitrocan
overall
youngs
is
always
a
good
treat
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
nothing
fancy
here
but
solid
nonetheless
o
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
initially
thought
it
would
be
but
in
spite
of
not
meeting
my
expectations
in
this
aspect
it
was
still
a
very
good
stout
that
i
will
certainly
revisit
again
thin
body
i
would
like
this
to
be
a
bit
thicker
and
sweeter
with
more
flavor
overall
though
its
a
decent
beer
o
as
chocolatey
a
beer
as
youll
find
this
side
of
choklat
however
this
beer
showcases
the
dark
roasty
bitter
side
of
chocolate
and
isnt
ad
sweet
as
other
chocolate
stouts
a
good
beer
overall
though
im
not
a
fan
of
the
nitro
overall
this
is
a
textbook
beer
on
this
style
every
socalled
beer
drinker
should
taste
it
to
see
what
a
sweetmilk
stout
is
supposed
to
be
light
drinkable
creamy
with
lots
of
flavor
and
balance
this
beer
pours
a
really
dark
brown
color
it
has
2figners
of
lighttan
head
resting
on
top
the
retention
is
so
good
that
i
could
go
to
sleep
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
it
would
still
be
there
it
looks
like
a
wonderful
layer
of
cream
the
smell
has
a
nice
roasted
bitterness
to
it
there
are
also
some
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
to
it
the
taste
is
roasty
and
dry
there
are
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
just
like
the
nose
the
finish
is
roasty
and
slightly
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
it
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
has
a
super
creamy
feel
to
it
it
is
roasty
and
a
touch
dry
this
has
great
drinkability
i
could
easily
down
some
pints
of
this
since
the
head
never
goes
away
and
it
is
so
smooth
it
is
like
having
a
layer
of
cream
on
top
wonderful
overall
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
o
overall
very
tasty
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
surely
try
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
overall
i
had
read
such
great
reviews
on
this
brew
and
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
not
a
real
complex
or
bold
beer
drinkability
was
high
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
in
my
opinion
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
but
overall
this
was
still
pretty
good
o
a
very
to
the
point
chocolate
stout
that
touches
on
all
the
flavour
elements
you
would
expect
a
must
for
stout
fans
a
decent
chocolate
stout
but
theres
certainly
far
better
examples
readily
available
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
this
again
couldnt
tell
you
where
i
first
had
this
but
ive
had
it
in
the
nitrocan
and
on
tap
at
various
venues
pours
like
a
good
stout
a
creamy
opaque
black
cascading
bubbles
culminate
in
a
solid
beige
head
aroma
of
chocolate
milk
with
some
coffee
notes
taste
is
well
look
its
not
gonna
taste
exactly
like
chocolate
milk
as
the
name
might
imply
but
its
still
very
smooth
and
chocolatey
with
notes
of
coffee
bitterness
not
much
in
the
hop
department
of
course
just
lots
of
chocolate
malts
and
roastiness
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
and
not
only
drinkable
but
also
good
for
making
carbomb
cupcakes
with
baileys
icing
of
course
o
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
easy
to
find
i
would
of
course
highly
recommend
it
overall
good
stout
lacked
complexity
that
i
enjoy
i
am
fairly
certain
i
sampled
this
before
on
tap
while
travelling
in
atlanta
and
i
remember
it
having
a
much
fuller
body
than
what
i
experienced
from
the
bottle
the
bottle
was
good
but
my
hopes
were
higher
very
enjoyable
chocolate
flavors
that
id
definitely
go
for
again
overall
i
really
have
not
developed
a
taste
for
this
style
yet
much
to
my
own
frustration
though
the
flavors
go
deeply
and
are
well
balanced
its
just
not
lively
enough
for
me
whenever
i
return
to
giving
milk
stouts
another
go
ill
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
of
these
for
sure
pours
a
really
dark
brown
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
that
quickly
disappears
average
carbonation
and
lacing
beer
is
incredibly
dark
almost
black
impossible
to
see
through
nose
is
chocolate
malt
coffee
and
some
hops
in
the
background
nose
is
fairly
weak
and
somewhat
thin
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
present
taste
is
lighter
but
a
really
nice
chocolatemaltsweetbitter
combo
happening
zero
alcohol
noticeable
when
drinking
feel
is
really
silky
smooth
w
some
hops
in
the
background
fairly
low
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
medium
malt
feel
fairly
dry
finish
as
well
overall
this
is
totally
solid
for
the
style
enjoyable
good
session
beer
and
recommended
if
you
like
the
style
cheers
pours
a
dark
cola
like
color
with
a
three
finger
creamy
chocolate
milk
looking
head
which
gives
way
to
gobs
and
rings
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
the
tatse
is
of
milk
chocolate
and
some
sweet
malt
flaovrs
the
end
has
a
coffee
and
roasty
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
sliky
and
creamy
a
very
nice
feel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
the
aroma
is
inviting
and
the
flavor
is
big
and
bold
this
is
an
easy
drink
and
a
flavor
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
o
smooth
chocolate
ale
definitely
worth
trying
i
highly
recommend
it
at
least
once
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
chocolate
stout
but
ive
had
better
still
i
dont
regret
buying
but
as
far
as
buying
again
things
like
peche
mortel
and
southern
tier
choklatmokah
or
others
are
better
choices
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
though
rich
and
flavoursome
plenty
of
dark
flavours
going
on
with
the
chocolate
blending
nicely
into
the
mix
i
sort
of
expected
it
to
dominate
the
flavour
profile
but
it
matches
the
overall
character
well
the
only
quibble
is
a
slightly
insubstantial
body
but
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
tasty
and
well
worth
sampling
overall
a
very
good
desert
beer
a
must
try
d
o
imo
the
best
chocolate
stout
ive
had
with
plenty
of
cocoa
flavors
good
sweetness
a
creamy
texture
and
a
superb
dark
chocolate
finish
o
this
needs
to
be
paired
with
a
sweet
dessert
as
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
drinkable
and
a
beer
i
will
have
again
good
but
not
exceptional
to
me
4
havent
tried
making
a
black
and
tan
with
it
yet
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
such
a
classic
nothing
over
the
top
just
a
well
done
staple
of
a
beer
i
may
have
done
myself
in
trying
this
on
nitro
first
it
may
be
a
little
plain
from
the
can
i
guess
ill
have
to
find
out

i
would
not
suggest
the
nitrocan
it
some
how
mutes
the
flavor
of
the
beer
to
a
point
where
it
is
like
a
watery
stout
i
hoped
it
to
make
the
beer
even
more
creamy
however
it
made
the
beer
lackluster
medium
to
full
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
will
always
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
on
the
market
the
body
has
a
good
thickness
to
it
but
is
not
sticky
or
coating
in
the
least
the
carbonation
is
not
fizzy
at
all
except
for
the
foam
from
the
head
that
sticks
to
my
upper
lip
and
gives
the
beer
an
excellent
creamy
easydrinking
mouthfeel
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
is
like
drinking
5

abv
chocolate
milk
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
the
chocolate
needs
to
be
a
lot
stronger
this
is
ok
but
if
i
really
want
a
chocolate
forward
beer
i
would
go
with
rogues
chocolate
stout
or
southern
tiers
choklat
i
would
be
interested
to
try
this
out
of
a
bottle
to
compare
pours
black
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
frothy
foamy
creambrown
head
smells
of
chocolate
caramel
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
taste
is
rather
thin
consisting
of
chocolate
malt
some
grain
caramel
and
water
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
remember
and
seems
thinner
than
many
other
nitrogenated
stouts
it
finishes
sweet
and
dry
overall
a
decent
stout
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
offerings
also
the
mouth
feel
could
use
some
fine
tuning
other
than
that
feel
lucky
to
be
able
to
try
such
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
more
thing
let
this
baby
warm
to
almost
room
temperature
you
will
not
regret
it
overall
perhaps
a
bit
more
subtle
on
the
nitro
very
drinkable
and
certianly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
likely
my
last
time
knocking
at
youngs
door
d
without
a
doubt
an
a
beer
in
my
opinion
from
the
initial
pour
the
appearance
smell
and
certainly
the
flavormouthfeel
a
great
brew
best
milksweet
stout
ive
had
to
date
and
what
beers
of
this
style
should
strive
for
i
do
give
credit
to
the
nitro
and
if
i
were
them
i
would
only
serve
it
on
nitro
taps
or
in
nitro
cans
makes
the
beer
what
it
should
be
o
i
can
definitely
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
beer
its
classically
delicious
with
more
than
enough
complexity
to
satisfy
me
in
many
different
situations
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
imagine
a
traditional
english
pub
beer
smooth
light
and
uniquely
bitter
overall
fantastic
just
what
i
would
be
going
for
if
i
were
to
create
a
chocolate
stout
great
with
desert
the
appearance
for
a
novice
was
very
goodexactly
what
i
imagine
a
stout
should
look
like
reminded
me
of
when
i
left
motor
oil
laying
around
in
containers
until
i
could
take
it
to
a
recycling
center
the
smell
to
me
was
too
much
i
like
chocolatebut
to
me
this
was
a
cheap
kahlua
imitation
very
hard
to
bring
this
to
my
lips
forturnately
the
taste
was
much
bettera
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitterness
if
only
the
odor
was
different
the
bottle
date
was
31911
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
milk
stout
while
i
love
the
look
that
nitro
gives
a
beer
i
would
rather
have
an
average
head
but
some
legitimate
mouthfeel
still
would
gladly
buy
again
o
probably
the
best
of
this
style
and
a
great
stout
for
food
it
is
an
extremely
drinakable
stout
and
perfect
for
a
stout
drinker
looking
for
something
in
hot
weather
and
other
situations
where
a
heavy
stout
is
not
ideal
m
full
bodied
this
beer
is
a
mouthful
although
carbonation
is
noted
on
the
glass
it
has
absolutely
no
bite
the
beer
isnt
sticky
at
all
and
isnt
overly
drying
either
it
is
very
creamy
though
o
this
is
a
good
one
but
nothing
that
gets
me
going
crazy
very
chocolatey
taste
as
one
would
hope
with
a
little
bit
of
bittersweet
and
a
little
milky
sweet
but
there
are
plenty
of
complexities
in
the
beer
to
make
it
fun
very
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
a
20oz
of
this
can
go
down
pretty
easily
but
its
thickness
can
sink
in
your
stomach
pretty
well
and
one
is
definitely
enough
m
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
and
a
slight
watery
finish
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
though
id
prefer
a
little
more
chocolate
considering
the
name
o
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
brews
on
nitro
but
this
one
was
tasty
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
chocolate
aroma
is
present
and
seems
to
dominate
but
the
roastiness
is
there
with
some
minerals
the
taste
is
quite
good
perhaps
a
little
loose
i
feel
the
nitro
also
thins
it
out
a
bit
good
dessert
beer
or
perhaps
a
beginer
beer
prior
to
some
stouts
o
a
delicious
stout
thats
full
of
flavor
very
well
crafted
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
full
filling
beer
for
a
chocolate
stout
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
a
good
chocolate
malt
beer
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
chocolate
stout
the
right
beer
for
the
right
mood
or
perhaps
time
dessert
its
possible
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
tried
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
which
is
surprising
considering
its
the
type
of
beer
you
can
find
in
a
lot
of
places
maybe
ive
been
hanging
out
in
to
many
beer
bars
that
think
it
isnt
exciting
enough
to
have
on
tap
whatever
the
reason
i
havent
tried
this
one
im
glad
that
i
did
pretty
good
beer
o
a
very
nice
stout
and
definately
up
there
with
the
meantime
and
saltaire
chocolate
creations
a
bit
disappointed
expected
a
bit
more
chocolate
for
my
liking
i
have
7
more
bottles
to
get
through
perhaps
my
review
will
be
altered
by
that
time
looking
forward
to
them
all
o
love
it
wouldve
been
incredible
i
think
with
a
slice
of
mudcake
and
a
dollop
of
ice
cream
pair
with
a
desert
and
dont
drink
it
too
cold
o
perfect
for
a
winters
night
tastes
fantastic
and
highly
drinkable
i
am
truly
impressed
by
this
i
suppose
the
weak
mouthfeel
is
the
only
discernible
hiccup
overall
like
i
said
before
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
the
body
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
not
a
lot
to
complain
about
of
course
ill
have
another
unfortunately
the
stout
is
very
thin
and
it
left
me
wanting
something
with
a
richer
creamier
texture
to
complement
the
flavor
a
very
delicious
stout
id
like
to
see
how
the
bottled
variety
compares
to
a
nitrocan
or
on
tap
cheers
overall
this
is
a
different
but
good
take
on
a
chocolate
stout
with
good
cocoa
and
chocolate
flavors
as
the
main
charactors
a
little
thin
but
it
has
sone
good
points
worth
a
try
o
out
of
the
bottle
this
thing
is
atrocious
but
from
a
nitro
tap
or
nitro
can
its
wonderful
amazing
how
good
carbonation
can
save
a
super
thin
stout
id
like
a
bit
more
from
the
flavor
and
aroma
areas
but
they
are
no
where
near
bad
edit
i
just
tried
it
in
can
form
again
its
got
a
widget
so
theres
a
really
impressive
nitro
feel
to
it
unfortunately
it
does
rob
a
good
portion
of
the
flavor
good
but
too
watery
o
a
classic
that
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
great
for
dessert
and
a
good
way
for
me
to
convince
my
girlfriend
to
try
some
beer
one
of
the
ultimate
dessert
beers
on
the
market
today
this
beer
poured
out
of
the
nitro
can
as
a
milky
brown
color
that
surged
into
a
deep
blackish
brown
color
the
head
was
creamy
and
thick
like
a
guinness
typically
looks
the
smell
is
of
some
roasted
malts
and
a
ton
of
rich
chocolate
the
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
too
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
kickass
when
drank
at
the
right
time
do
very
drinkable
surprisingly
well
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
beer
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
mouth
like
some
stouts
but
is
just
super
sweet
and
simple
genuinely
enjoyable
d
an
excellent
stout
characterised
but
not
dominated
by
its
nuanced
chocolate
flavour
without
it
feeling
too
sweet
or
like
a
novelty
quite
drinkable
despite
the
full
body
its
a
twist
on
the
usual
mealinabottle
stout
instead
its
dessert
this
pours
a
black
color
with
a
light
brown
finger
width
thick
head
with
tiny
nitro
induced
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
smell
is
pretty
mellow
though
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
as
expected
from
the
nitro
can
the
taste
is
more
watery
that
i
remember
an
effect
of
the
nitro
can
or
the
past
best
date
beer
the
main
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
smoked
chocolate
after
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
lingers
for
a
while
this
out
of
a
can
is
smoother
and
more
session
like
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
but
its
also
more
subdued
and
not
as
tasty
ill
stick
to
the
bottles
from
now
on
ill
also
edit
my
can
review
at
a
later
date
when
i
get
a
fresher
can
overall
very
good
i
almost
feel
like
its
a
snack
rather
than
a
drink
a
very
tasty
treat
and
easily
among
the
best
couple
of
chocolate
brews
ive
ever
had
right
next
to
brooklyns
black
chocolate
stout
overall
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
choco
stout
it
might
just
be
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
pardon
me
but
i
have
to
go
and
finish
my
glass
oi
enjoyed
both
but
the
first
one
was
much
more
flavorful
than
the
second
will
probably
buy
again
after
this
4pack
which
i
will
test
for
black
and
tans
o
really
well
crafted
brew
i
can
see
why
this
remains
firmly
in
the
beers
of
fame
list
really
nice
beer
i
havent
had
this
one
in
a
while
but
im
impressed
seems
to
lean
more
towards
coffee
than
chocolate
but
still
is
a
damn
fine
brew
easily
sessionable
available
everywhere
a
great
choice
for
a
tasty
stout
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
pillowy
off
white
head
head
the
smell
is
slightly
slightly
roasty
and
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
watery
and
smooth
with
barely
any
hints
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
super
thin
overall
this
beer
was
a
pretty
big
let
down
compared
to
how
pepople
review
it
overall
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
great
chocolate
taste
but
not
a
sweet
beer
excellent
balanced
mouthfeel
this
is
a
sweet
stout
i
can
say
will
go
over
well
with
any
sweet
tooth
o
not
as
much
noticeable
chocolate
as
id
expected
despite
the
fact
that
its
listed
in
the
ingredients
coffee
being
the
truly
dominant
force
in
this
beer
not
bad
regardless
overall
this
was
a
pleasure
to
taste
and
review
i
wouldnt
know
quite
where
to
rate
this
on
the
list
of
best
chocolates
out
there
but
it
probably
would
rate
on
the
upper
end
of
the
spectrum
youngs
got
it
right
with
this
one
o
what
a
brew
this
is
top
notch
for
sure
great
subup
for
guinness
or
muprhys
ill
return
often
another
please
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
had
my
reservations
a
lot
of
folks
dont
like
these
nitrocans
but
whats
not
to
love
you
get
the
yummy
richness
of
a
nitro
pour
and
all
the
flavor
plus
the
alcohol
is
low
and
the
taste
is
great
so
you
have
an
offthebeatenpath
session
beer
here
overall
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
is
nice
sessionable
stout
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
i
need
something
that
wont
put
me
to
bed
the
perfect
winter
day
drinking
beer
i
have
mixed
it
half
and
half
with
wells
banana
bread
beer
which
is
an
excellent
anytime
after
dinner
beverage
nice
black
color
with
a
small
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
of
dark
roasty
malt
and
cocoa
delicious
milky
chocolate
and
malt
taste
dark
roast
coffee
but
not
sweet
mouthfeel
is
both
carbonation
and
milky
this
stout
is
really
good
and
i
drink
it
often
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
was
not
quite
as
good
honestly
as
the
last
time
i
had
it
which
i
believe
was
out
of
the
regular
bottle
and
not
nitrocanned
i
wonder
if
the
non
nitro
version
has
bit
more
flavor
despite
not
as
good
mouthfeel
and
such
the
beer
was
quite
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
all
the
time
as
was
just
kind
of
more
simple
then
i
remembered
all
said
and
done
though
this
is
still
pretty
nice
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
that
lasts
thin
legs
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
syrup
in
milk
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
syrup
mild
cocoa
bitterness
on
the
palate
quickly
fades
due
to
the
nitrotap
this
beer
is
very
thick
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
get
too
often
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
on
nitrotap
dont
get
me
wrong
i
feel
that
ive
had
better
milk
stouts
but
very
few
o
dominated
by
chocolate
but
not
overly
sweet
o
very
good
chocolate
stout
always
worried
with
beer
like
this
never
know
of
it
will
be
unbalanced
due
to
the
unique
flavor
but
they
nailed
it
here
overall
decent
but
not
extraordinary
i
think
this
beer
is
best
on
tap
the
remaining
beers
from
my
4
pack
of
nitro
cans
will
be
reserved
for
their
original
purpose
cooking
cheers
o
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
brew
the
flavors
were
there
but
they
didnt
grasp
my
taste
buds
and
linger
like
i
want
a
beer
like
this
to
still
ok
but
not
my
favorite
so
good
d
very
drinkable
wo
too
high
abv
could
have
easily
had
another
plan
on
drinking
this
again
as
its
easy
to
find
on
draft
and
in
canbottle
at
my
wob
not
so
sweet
even
though
its
chocolatey
light
to
mediumbodied
grainy
texture
great
drinkability
taste
is
wonderful
coffee
chocolate
malt
are
all
present
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
for
a
beer
this
dark
but
oh
well
after
a
few
beers
at
a
place
with
a
good
beer
menu
this
is
a
great
way
to
end
a
night
decent
beer
especially
considering
this
is
out
of
the
can
definitely
need
to
let
it
warm
so
that
the
taste
can
really
come
through
ive
had
this
before
and
simply
doesnt
recall
it
being
this
good
maybe
it
is
the
larger
bottle
maybe
this
one
is
fresher
maybe
ive
gone
mad
either
way
this
just
really
great
beer
and
worth
of
the
praise
5
2
has
simply
never
been
this
dark
and
this
good
please
read
a
beer
this
dark
has
never
better
this
good
at
that
abv
not
that
this
is
the
best
5
2
or
less
abv
beer
it
isnt
price
on
this
is
a
touch
high
but
well
ignore
that
aspect
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
and
would
drink
this
again
on
a
cold
night
think
cool
creamy
flat
chocolate
milk
delicious
i
have
had
this
in
both
a
bottle
in
england
and
a
can
in
the
us
the
can
being
100
better
for
some
reason
it
looses
something
when
bottled
that
is
captured
when
canned
this
has
a
slightly
sweet
milky
and
definitely
chocolatey
flavor
pour
it
into
a
thin
pint
glass
and
let
it
settle
out
similar
to
a
guinness
sip
slowly
and
savor
worth
the
time
to
pour
and
wait
to
sip
and
money
investment
for
a
4
pack
of
this
o
would
be
great
if
they
packed
a
bit
more
flavor
into
this
brew
i
did
enjoy
it
though
o
a
great
mealtime
stout
paired
well
with
steak
and
chargrilled
veggies
overall
first
time
i
have
had
it
from
the
nitro
can
and
i
do
prefer
it
to
the
bottle
you
do
not
get
this
creamy
head
with
the
bottle
but
the
smell
does
suffer
a
bit
amazing
dessert
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
d
no
reason
not
to
try
this
if
youre
a
dark
or
strong
beer
fan
packs
a
punch
but
apologizes
with
some
sweetness
o
a
very
nice
dessert
beer
that
i
will
keep
readily
available
what
a
treat
i
prefer
this
nitrocan
version
over
the
bottle
for
the
better
mouthfeel
and
appearance
even
though
the
aroma
suffers
a
bit
a
very
tasty
chocolate
stout
o
the
chocolate
sweetness
is
sometimes
too
much
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
session
chocolate
stout
great
for
desserts
or
on
a
cold
evening
in
front
of
the
fire
overall
damn
good
stout
hits
the
spot
notes
i
am
glad
to
finally
buy
drink
and
rate
this
beer
as
it
is
one
of
the
most
frequently
rated
here
on
beeradvocate
and
i
must
admit
that
i
was
curious
o
outstanding
very
impressed
with
this
brew
which
was
unexpected
i
thought
the
chocolate
would
overwhelm
the
flavor
profile
but
thankfully
it
did
not
very
well
done
overall
a
bit
pricey
but
would
be
well
worth
buying
as
a
treat
every
now
and
then
overall
a
delicious
stout
that
makes
a
great
afterdinner
drink
this
is
one
that
i
have
always
put
off
trying
for
some
reason
it
was
worth
the
wait
overall
a
very
good
stout
looks
sexy
smells
sexy
and
the
taste
is
there
to
match
very
good
carbonation
for
a
stout
as
well
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
that
not
to
mention
the
whole
experience
itself
when
i
first
got
this
i
thought
it
was
going
to
taste
like
a
watered
down
stout
aka
guiness
but
once
i
tasted
it
i
was
almost
shocked
this
rivals
a
lot
of
quality
stouts
that
i
have
tasted
before
my
only
gripe
is
the
low
abv
which
is
kind
of
unusual
for
stouts
the
beer
pours
the
expected
blackish
brown
color
with
this
beers
customary
fabulous
mocha
colored
creamy
pillow
on
tap
head
retention
is
exceptional
with
considerable
sticky
lacing
all
around
the
nose
is
attractive
but
this
is
really
the
only
place
this
beer
falls
off
a
bit
nevertheless
i
get
an
attractive
nose
of
light
vanilla
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
however
on
the
palate
this
beer
once
again
flirt
with
perfection
the
beer
has
something
of
a
burnt
toast
flavor
which
is
quickly
overwhelmed
by
cherry
vanilla
and
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
it
gets
this
beer
is
light
soft
and
creamy
with
a
nearly
endless
smooth
finish
drinkability
is
just
stunning
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
noticeable
and
yet
its
nothing
short
of
astonishing
how
much
flavor
this
low
abv
beer
delivers
an
absolute
benchmark
especially
on
the
nitro
just
excellent
o
sort
of
straightforward
but
very
delicious
a
great
desert
beer
for
any
occasion
poures
a
nice
black
color
no
head
just
a
khaki
ring
with
a
little
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
both
the
same
with
chocolate
sweet
malts
and
slight
roasted
bitter
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
tastes
more
carbonated
than
the
lack
of
head
would
suggest
overall
a
good
beer
try
it
as
a
chocolate
truffle
approx
2oz
lambic
framboise
to
12oz
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
o
huge
fan
but
not
as
up
to
snuff
as
its
draught
brother
the
utter
smoothness
of
this
brew
combined
with
its
outstanding
flavor
make
this
one
to
come
back
to
again
and
again
worth
the
cost
o
overall
a
good
stout
not
my
favorite
however
a
bit
strong
on
the
chocolate
taste
especially
going
down
smooth
just
as
i
like
my
stouts
but
id
find
some
better
ones
out
there
before
trying
this
again
overall
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
any
occasion
and
because
of
the
low
abv
one
does
not
have
to
worry
about
getting
overpowered
by
this
beer
the
price
is
also
a
plus
pours
a
small
one
finger
light
light
brown
head
the
head
is
super
creamy
and
isnt
going
anywhere
as
would
be
expected
with
a
nitro
beer
the
body
is
pitch
black
no
hues
of
red
or
anything
completely
dark
completely
nonsee
through
overall
it
looks
pretty
damn
good
but
it
is
a
nitro
beer
so
it
should
look
good
the
smell
is
very
nice
sweet
chocolate
on
the
nose
i
also
get
a
noticeable
deep
malt
smell
and
perhaps
a
sour
smell
like
there
would
be
in
a
guinness
so
i
dont
know
if
that
has
to
do
with
the
nitro
or
not
overall
the
smell
is
chocolaty
its
a
pretty
good
smell
all
around
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
i
think
i
like
it
more
the
nitro
version
has
that
guinness
sour
taste
to
it
kinda
an
unpleasant
taste
i
mean
it
works
in
guinness
because
its
not
a
guinness
without
it
but
i
dont
know
if
it
works
in
this
beer
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
sour
just
interrupts
what
would
be
a
huge
chocolate
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
big
chocolate
punch
and
then
a
mild
sour
taste
but
as
it
is
now
its
50
sour
then
50
chocolate
overall
i
get
a
nice
malt
taste
and
a
nice
chocolate
taste
but
unfortunately
a
decent
sour
taste
overall
the
taste
is
ok
not
a
good
as
i
was
expecting
though
mouthfeel
is
hard
to
describe
because
anyone
who
has
had
a
nitro
beer
knows
that
it
is
a
unique
mouthfeel
its
a
very
thin
beer
but
at
the
same
time
its
really
creamy
and
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
so
its
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
in
fact
its
good
just
not
as
big
as
you
would
expect
with
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
high
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
on
this
beer
good
beer
and
its
actually
gotten
more
chocolaty
as
the
beer
has
progressed
but
still
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
good
beer
but
not
great
o
very
nice
stout
with
a
strong
chocolatecoffee
and
even
licorice
flavor
hidden
there
somewhere
roasted
malt
supply
a
fair
portion
of
the
bitterness
nice
roasted
malt
rich
chocolate
and
classic
stout
flavors
all
combine
to
make
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
d
4
this
beer
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
yet
theres
something
missing
that
has
me
lacking
excitement
over
it
regardless
it
is
solid
overall
id
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
because
it
has
as
light
feel
to
go
along
with
its
good
flavor
d
i
like
this
brew
easy
on
the
palate
very
tasty
o
i
was
immensely
pleased
with
the
nitrocan
version
its
everything
it
claims
to
be
and
more
its
too
bad
we
dont
get
it
in
my
area
there
are
plenty
of
other
decent
chocolate
beers
out
there
pass
this
one
by
and
pick
another
one
up
overall
i
did
not
like
this
one
bit
lots
of
people
seem
to
like
it
but
not
me
i
didnt
like
it
the
first
time
then
a
few
months
later
i
picked
up
another
bottle
and
got
the
same
result
this
beer
has
too
much
of
an
artificial
taste
to
it
i
love
me
some
chocolate
stouts
but
this
was
a
drain
pour
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
plus
but
could
be
more
viscious
still
this
is
a
great
creamy
feel
and
a
wonderful
brew
overall
o
this
beer
is
much
much
better
from
the
nitro
can
than
it
is
from
the
bottle
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
chocolate
seems
lost
and
the
lack
of
the
creamy
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
the
cause
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
but
seems
a
bit
more
subdued
in
most
categories
than
i
was
hoping
for
still
a
really
solid
beer
though
now
just
wishing
i
had
some
dessert
to
compliment
it
the
price
of
the
four
back
is
a
bit
more
than
i
would
want
to
pay
again
but
i
hear
this
is
phenomenal
on
tap
so
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
overall
drinkability
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
you
could
suck
down
the
four
pack
of
cans
easily
alcohol
wasnt
noticeably
present
decent
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
o
great
beer
there
are
better
ones
but
glad
that
i
finally
bought
one
and
gave
it
a
try
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
has
never
disappointed
o
smooth
delicious
dark
chocolatey
great
brew
o
good
delicious
beer
that
is
not
too
sweet
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
overbearing
id
order
this
over
a
standard
irish
stout
anyday
o
not
something
i
would
drink
often
but
well
worth
it
on
special
occasions
or
when
the
craving
hits
you
very
drinkable
this
is
not
an
every
day
beer
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
a
fun
treat
i
would
have
another
one
but
maybe
just
on
christmas
or
a
special
holiday
o
total
turn
off
by
the
mouth
feel
it
takes
away
from
the
flavor
and
is
extremely
disappointing
could
not
finish
it
will
not
buy
this
one
again
i
would
call
this
especially
chocolatey
much
less
double
chocolatey
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
chocolate
stout
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
good
great
beer
to
have
a
couple
of
on
a
cold
night
overall
taste
is
delicious
and
a
great
go
to
winter
time
stout
on
my
top
10
list
and
an
easy
go
to
selection
pours
a
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
mocha
head
very
creamy
looking
black
body
only
a
small
amount
of
lacing
remains
kind
of
disappointing
smells
of
chocolate
roasted
barley
sweet
malts
some
yeasty
funk
tastes
is
dark
chocolate
toffee
coffee
crystal
malts
some
funky
yeasty
after
taste
light
carbonation
medium
bodied
fitting
for
the
style
but
id
prefer
more
body
overall
its
descent
but
a
touch
too
roasty
for
my
taste
and
a
bit
thin
10
a
4
pack
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
a
41111
best
by
date
black
in
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
with
good
staying
power
foam
very
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
and
light
lacings
on
the
glass
as
the
name
suggests
prominent
chocolate
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
light
hint
of
coffee
smooth
and
creamy
feel
with
light
carbonation
but
a
little
thinner
than
i
had
expected
dark
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
with
an
underlying
coffee
flavor
finished
with
a
bitter
hop
edge
which
added
to
the
character
and
complexity
of
this
stout
a
very
good
stout
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
delicious
all
around
o
great
stout
very
good
for
the
style
and
works
beautifully
with
a
lambic
o
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
that
this
was
a
great
beer
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
love
it
and
truly
get
the
chocolate
taste
and
smooth
finish
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
youngs
but
usually
only
on
cask
in
the
uk
for
the
most
part
bottled
british
beers
pale
in
comparison
to
their
cask
equivalents
although
this
ones
on
co2
its
very
very
enjoyable
has
a
great
smell
and
taste
a
very
rich
taste
and
hence
could
probably
have
more
than
23
in
one
sitting
as
it
is
basically
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
however
it
was
a
great
drinking
experience
o
for
a
session
stout
this
is
a
wonderful
pick
not
super
chocolatey
but
sweeter
than
the
traditional
stout
and
just
as
creamy
and
silky
smooth
as
the
rest
had
this
beer
on
tap
this
beer
was
great
black
creamy
off
whte
head
with
exceptional
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
taste
like
bitter
sweet
chocolate
and
is
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
there
isnt
a
very
stong
hop
aroma
that
doesnt
over
power
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
has
great
body
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
just
an
exceptional
beer
and
i
would
have
it
over
and
over
drinkability
i
thought
this
beer
was
really
nice
though
the
lack
of
chocolate
notes
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
think
that
the
overall
smoothness
of
the
beer
as
well
as
the
interesting
mix
between
the
coffee
and
mild
citrus
flavors
were
really
interesting
and
made
up
for
it
it
was
a
really
nice
beer
to
drink
really
slowly
i
had
a
500
ml
more
or
less
a
pint
size
bottle
and
was
still
finishing
it
off
when
we
were
practicing
it
took
me
about
3
hours
to
drink
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
this
beer
was
overhyped
for
me
it
was
pretty
much
just
another
stout
much
like
guiness
and
was
easy
to
drink
a
decently
drinkable
low
abv
stout
very
similar
to
guiness
but
sweeter
and
less
bitter
easy
enough
to
drink
and
worth
a
try
not
fantastic
though
if
you
have
the
option
to
try
it
in
a
bottle
go
that
route
i
enjoyed
it
more
you
just
miss
out
on
the
creamy
head
drinkability
there
is
only
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
this
but
it
is
what
ouns
out
all
the
flavors
a
truly
delicious
beer
chocolately
but
super
drinkable
i
want
to
inject
this
into
my
veins
when
im
sad
complements
freer
jazz
very
well
i
recommend
sonny
rollins
trio
recordings
in
europe
1959
or
watch
a
tottenham
free
flowing
soccer
match
this
is
a
mighty
fine
stout
there
is
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
and
its
multidimensional
i
dont
know
that
i
could
really
enjoy
the
sweet
roasted
chocolate
flavor
all
night
but
its
great
for
a
pint
now
and
then
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
so
tasty
reminds
me
of
the
days
of
being
a
kid
at
school
getting
chocolate
milk
instead
of
just
milk
treat
yourself
to
some
drink
up
dheard
this
beer
talked
up
a
bunch
so
i
was
kinda
let
down
it
was
good
but
really
muted
flavors
and
just
wasnt
the
sweet
goodness
i
was
looking
for
will
give
this
beer
another
try
sometime
and
see
if
i
feel
different
this
ale
deserves
the
high
ba
ratings
that
most
have
given
it
this
is
a
choclate
lovers
english
dark
ale
lovers
dream
full
of
complexity
richness
and
warmth
that
is
perfect
for
a
winters
night
cap
it
is
also
perfect
for
a
desert
ale
i
think
this
will
go
perfectly
with
german
cheesecake
for
4
a
pint
it
is
a
steal
d
the
metallic
component
completely
ruins
the
beer
for
me
i
will
have
to
try
another
one
to
make
sure
this
isnt
a
pervasive
problem
wow
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brownblack
with
an
offwhite
creamy
lingering
head
smells
wonderful
of
relatively
sweet
dark
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
grain
complemented
perfectly
with
a
hop
feel
in
the
nose
feels
incredibly
smooth
just
wonderful
the
head
is
soft
and
the
body
is
silky
a
sexy
beer
really
tastes
of
a
delicious
dark
stout
dark
and
coffeetoffeelike
with
a
strong
hop
presence
which
is
balanced
with
the
delicate
flavor
of
dark
chocolate
to
provide
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
beer
a
great
latenight
after
dinner
beer
wonderful
and
absolutely
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
hearty
this
beer
slides
down
my
throat
makes
me
feel
it
then
makes
me
want
more
my
spouse
and
i
often
have
this
as
a
desert
instead
of
chocolate
or
cola
the
cpj
poured
a
muddy
black
with
a
large
light
brown
rocky
head
with
average
retention
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
chocolate
malts
and
a
light
doughy
yeast
with
strong
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tasted
lightly
sweet
and
quite
malty
in
the
beginning
and
finished
about
the
same
but
with
a
strong
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
that
stayed
on
the
palate
for
a
very
long
while
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
creamy
yet
watery
in
texture
with
a
mild
carbonation
overall
a
brew
with
lots
of
chocolate
flavor
but
not
much
else
d
great
example
of
this
style
definitely
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
stout
and
light
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
stout
if
that
were
ever
possible
a
really
great
beer
with
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
yum
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
name
like
double
chocolate
you
would
expect
this
to
be
a
chocolate
explosion
but
it
is
not
there
is
a
hefty
amount
of
sweet
pipe
tobacco
going
on
and
it
is
the
primary
flavor
of
the
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
frequent
maybe
something
on
the
odd
occasion
taste
was
very
similar
with
chocolate
being
very
noticeable
it
was
sweet
but
very
cocoaish
roasted
coffee
added
a
nice
finish
that
was
also
a
little
bitter
coffee
bitter
roasted
malts
brought
some
sweetness
to
the
finish
as
well
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
better
middle
to
the
body
but
in
all
this
was
a
decent
stout
and
the
name
says
it
all
with
the
pronounced
chocolate
flavors
d
very
smooth
almost
a
creamy
texture
kind
of
a
milk
chocolate
dmmmm
i
want
this
all
night
long
its
so
tasty
and
disappears
so
quickly
taste
stays
and
is
so
easy
to
drink
d
exceptional
not
refreshing
but
lovely
anyway
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
nice
to
drink
over
a
long
conversation
with
friends
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
or
offer
one
to
anyone
who
likes
a
bit
of
chocolate
with
their
beer
overall
i
love
this
stuff
it
gives
a
little
more
than
a
standard
irish
stout
not
a
ton
but
enough
found
the
bottle
4pack
for
7
99
so
i
stocked
up
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
like
i
said
it
goes
down
easy
and
stays
down
without
a
problem
notesi
really
cant
say
this
is
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
hadsince
this
is
my
first
time
having
one
so
with
that
said
this
is
a
damn
good
beerit
is
everything
it
says
to
be
i
also
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
and
again
also
i
highly
recomend
this
for
everyone
who
is
a
fan
of
chocolate
stouts
not
what
i
expected
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
and
depth
pretty
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
in
a
way
the
body
is
solidly
full
without
being
heavy
drinkability
is
very
good
but
that
may
depend
on
your
tolerance
for
sweetness
overall
a
very
good
brew
thats
worth
your
time
grab
one
soon
i
feel
like
this
is
a
little
wimpier
than
i
remember
experiencing
a
lot
fo
things
being
a
little
more
washed
out
somehow
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
have
never
taken
the
time
to
review
it
that
ends
here
it
pours
a
clear
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
chocolate
powder
and
a
light
air
of
coffee
the
taste
simplifies
things
even
further
somehow
highlighting
the
roast
and
the
now
dark
chocolate
its
tasty
but
and
i
hate
putting
it
like
this
but
i
cant
think
of
a
better
way
still
kinda
boring
too
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
amazing
but
eminently
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
this
was
a
good
drinking
lighter
stout
as
far
as
chocolate
flavor
it
does
deliver
but
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
to
it
a
little
one
sided
at
times
in
the
mouth
the
abv
makes
it
a
mutibeer
drinker
the
overall
feel
to
it
doesnt
make
you
feel
full
so
having
a
couple
would
be
no
problem
drinkability
i
must
say
that
this
beer
is
very
good
and
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
however
considering
all
the
hype
that
surrounds
this
beer
and
all
that
ive
read
about
it
i
was
expecting
much
more
some
reviews
put
this
on
par
with
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
but
for
my
money
this
doesnt
even
compare
to
the
overall
satisfaction
of
the
rogue
that
being
said
this
beer
is
still
very
very
very
good
and
is
worth
a
try
d
a
wonderful
specimen
of
a
stout
with
a
flavor
that
demands
to
be
tasted
again
and
again
not
at
all
cloying
even
for
all
its
chocolatey
goodness
and
with
a
low
5
2
abv
approachable
enough
to
enjoy
that
flavor
several
times
in
one
sitting
d
this
does
go
down
insanely
easy
tons
of
milk
chocolate
almost
no
bitterness
and
a
light
body
a
perfect
session
beer
by
definition
but
id
rather
a
stout
with
more
body
mmmm
stout
with
your
stouty
stoutness
nice
chocolate
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
would
pair
well
with
chocolate
anything
and
stands
up
well
on
its
own
id
be
interested
to
see
how
beer
is
out
of
the
nitro
can
definitely
will
be
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
very
nice
pour
on
this
one
head
quickly
settles
to
about
a
half
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
toffee
color
body
was
nearly
black
and
basically
opaque
looked
delicious
and
i
couldnt
wait
to
try
some
aroma
was
somewhat
disappointing
slight
chocolate
milk
odor
but
very
faint
overall
taste
proved
much
better
than
the
smell
started
off
nice
and
sweet
with
nice
chocolate
and
maltiness
finished
dry
with
a
more
roasted
flavor
and
hints
of
coffee
the
finish
was
nice
and
kept
the
sweetness
up
front
from
becoming
too
much
mouthfeel
was
excellent
smooth
and
creamy
for
as
rich
as
this
beer
could
be
the
drinkability
was
good
as
it
did
not
feel
super
heavy
and
the
flavor
was
balanced
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
catching
up
overall
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
stouts
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
feel
like
it
sets
the
bar
fairly
high
overall
this
is
a
great
starting
point
for
stouts
guinness
fans
and
sweet
beer
fans
will
both
enjoy
this
as
well
as
anyone
who
has
an
affection
for
chocolate
milkshakes
cheers
dlike
the
wells
banana
bread
i
can
appreciate
it
for
its
success
within
the
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
incredibly
rich
and
creamy
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavours
and
aromas
its
an
overall
great
stout
i
give
a
schlitz
for
youngs
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
it
is
quite
tasty
but
it
is
also
pricey
if
i
could
buy
it
without
the
import
price
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
regularly
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
poured
from
bottle
no
date
into
an
english
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
opaque
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
very
sticky
lacing
that
coats
and
hardens
in
the
inside
of
the
glass
very
chocolatey
of
course
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
with
a
taste
of
milk
chocolate
and
almonds
very
mild
carbonation
otherwise
a
nice
drinkable
beer
d
very
flavorful
and
really
easy
to
drink
balance
sets
me
up
for
drink
after
drink
with
the
5
2
abv
i
could
see
drinking
this
one
for
an
evening
or
at
least
have
one
with
anything
called
death
by
chocolate
mouthfeel
as
mentioned
above
thick
and
chewy
but
amazingly
light
and
fluffy
at
the
same
time
very
good
very
enjoyable
beer
i
didnt
think
anything
held
a
candle
to
youngs
oatmeal
stout
but
this
brother
is
definitely
on
the
same
page
its
extremely
drinkable
and
is
one
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
contains
actual
chocolate
and
sugar
so
the
taste
isnt
a
surprise
but
it
isnt
excessively
sweet
i
had
a
high
expectation
of
this
beer
but
its
quite
disappointing
as
per
the
above
review
to
be
honest
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
a
very
delicious
fun
stout
that
will
be
enjoyed
by
novice
stout
lovers
and
as
a
novelty
by
serious
stout
lovers
stout
lovers
will
probably
crave
something
with
more
depth
power
and
complexity
but
you
can
always
enjoy
this
as
a
sort
of
stout
light
pretty
yummy
really
d
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
that
i
stumbled
across
at
my
local
brewpubbeer
bar
but
i
have
not
heard
of
it
before
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
it
but
wouldnt
pass
up
another
new
one
if
i
had
the
chance
drinkability
creamy
chocolates
with
enough
balance
of
toasted
malts
make
this
a
very
drinakable
beer
as
it
warmed
the
chocolate
flavors
really
showed
through
nice
aftertaste
in
the
finish
this
is
an
amazing
brew
chocolate
smell
and
taste
the
appearance
was
nothing
spectacular
but
everything
else
measured
up
i
have
decided
now
that
a
beer
really
look
bad
to
receive
low
marks
in
the
appearance
category
will
be
buying
this
soon
again

nontraditional
beer
it
has
a
great
appearance

aroma
upon
initial
contact
the
flavor
was
very
unique
and
the
chocolate
hints
make
it
a
beer
worth
testing
its
perfect
as
a
closer
or
for
something
sweet
and
different
im
glad
i
got
it
and

it

its

im

the

may
be
high

i

for

as

it

for

really
a

a

the

it

a

smell
the
first

was
just
what
i

then
the

kicked
in

actually

a

5had
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
before
i
was
a
serious
beer
advocate
didnt
like
it
at
the
time
since
it
was
given
to
me
and
i
had
to
drink
it
out
of
a
can
i
walk
by
this
beer
every
time
i
am
in
the
beer
store
went
to
the
store
with
my
fiancee
and
she
asked
about
it
i
told
her
what
i
thought
and
she
asked
if
we
could
split
it
anyway
so
i
went
ahead
and
picked
it
up
we
split
the
bottle
at
her
apartment
this
beer
is
much
better
than
i
remember
it
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
creamy
head
smell
is
exactly
like
sweet
chocolate
taste
starts
off
pretty
sweet
and
turns
into
a
slightly
bitter
cocoa
chocolate
very
creamy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
might
be
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one

the
only
downside
to
this

was
it
was
a

thin
i
would

it
to

the
thinness
does
however
make

a

it
was
the
first
thing
i
drank
and
the
last
thing
and
of

some
rich
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
flavors
not
overly
thick
a
little
sweet
malty
aroma
is
about
it
and
no
sense
of
chocolate
goes
down
smooth
it
had
a
cappuccinolike
taste
without
as
much
bitterness

there
is
enough
bitterness
for
good
balancethe
malt
comes
through
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
silk
and
excellent
i
found
it
to
be
a

less
heavy
than
some
other
stouts

i
could

a
few
at

in

this

to
give
it
another
shot

i
figured
my

might
have
not

mature
enough
to
appreciate

again

on
tap
at
nathans
in
washington
dc
poured
a
classic
nitro
stout
black
with
white
creamy
head
smelled
a
tad
sour
classy
quality
when
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
rum
because
it
seems
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
not
covered
up
by
the
malt
a
bit
more
effort
with
the
malt
and
this
could
be
an
excellent
beer
however
but
would
only
drink
one
of
ultrasticky
aroma
is
very
malty
with
rusty
crystal
malt
tones
lifting
almond
but
worth
trying
for
sure

like
coffee
and
cream
cafe
color
fills
the
glass
overall
i
think
this
would
make
a
terrific
dessert
drink
its
probably
not
something
id
drink
a
lot
of
or
frequently
though
despite
the
dark
chocolate
assault
on
the
senses
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
try
again
imho
a
great
thick
full
flavored
stout
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
probably
one
of
the
best
chocolate
beers
out
there
id
take
this
over
rogues
chocolate
great
dessert
beer
that
pairs
naturally
with
chocolate
desserts
or
a
fine
treat
all
by
itself
i
love
watching
the
cascading
effect
on
these
nitros
when
all
is
settled
this
beer
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
tan
color
head
i
could
not
detect
much
aroma
on
this

subtle

i

on

just
subtle
notes
of

once
you
dive
in
and
taste
this
beer
the
chocolate
smacks
you
in
the
face
this
is
basically
a
chocolate
milkshake
in
the
guise
of
a
stout
the
taste
definitely
lends
to
this
beer
being
consumed
as
a
dessert
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
a
nitro
beer
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
lacking
as
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
id
like
to
call
this
a
niche
stout
it
serves
its
purpose
well
when
looking
for
chocolate
and
it
is
interesting
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
midnight
black
with
a
creamy
browntinged
off
white
head
which
subsides
to
a
collar
that
manages
to
stick
around
a
bit
light
roasted
barley
with
hints
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
light
to
medium
read
too
thin
body
sparse
carbonation
still
somewhat
smooth
light
roasted
flavor
with
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
light
bittering
hops
provide
an
easy
finish
not
very
in
your
face
which
makes
it
quite
quaffable
i
think
this
beer
would
be
helped
substantially
by
the
nitro
effect
ill
try
it
in
the
nitro
can
next
time
still
a
solid
easy
drinking
flavored
stout
i
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
this
one
before
i
always
have
it
a
couple
of
times
a
year
at
least
as
it
is
such
a
treat
anway
dark
and
opaque
when
poured
the
overflowing
head
quickly
dissipated
i
thought
the
aroma
was
more
coffeelike
basically
i
find
the
taste
to
be
smooth
and
reminiscent
of
a
tootsie
roll
although
one
made
with
darker
chocolate
a
wonderful
treat
that
chocolate
lovers
should
enjoy
good
stuff
the
king
recommends
drinking
this
beer
with
a
salisbury
steak
extra
gravy
an
extremely
easy
drinking
stout
id
recommend
this
for
anyone
thats
a
novice
to
to
the
style
as
the
chocolate
and
nitro
softens
up
the
roasted
bittersweetness
considerably
not
something
id
want
every
day
but
its
worth
a
pint
when
available
its
probably
not
something
that
id
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
row
but
id
say
that
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
of
all
the
nitrogendelivered
stouts
i
have
had
youngs
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
ranks
at
the
top
its
an
amazing
brew
from
start
to
finish
that
just
pleases
so
many
senses
i
highly
recommend
pairing
this
with
chocolate
the
beer
takes
on
a
wonderful
new
complexion
when
paired
with
it
a
fine
showing
from
youngs
pours
a
dark
black
with
some
reddish
elemnts
if
held
up
to
the
light
moderate
to
mild
offwhite
head
smell
is
ok
nothing
especially
worth
noting
but
taste
is
quite
good
malty
and
sweet
i
taste
hops
sugar
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
good
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
lets
you
know
that
they
really
used
alot
of
dark
chocolate
in
there
as
my
mouth
feels
like
i
have
just
eaten
a
really
dry
dark
chocolate
bar
after
swallowing
what
seems
like
cocoa
particles
resides
in
my
mouth
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
taste
taste
is
more
of
a
mocha
cofee
taste
that
anything
chocolate
i
find
it
great
however
as
this
is
my
favorite
and
my
wifes
favorite
great
to
must
out
on
valentines
day
beer
is
good
happy
brewing
a
fantastic
stout
everything
a
good
stout
should
be
almost
black
in
colour
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
it
had
a
strong
chocolate
aroma
with
a
slight
coffee
scent
the
taste
reminded
me
of
ben
and
jerrys
coffee
coffee
buzz
buzz
it
was
a
fantastic
coffee
flavor
with
strong
chocolate
tones
it
is
a
true
desert
beer
with
a
hearty
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
for
some
reason
i
cant
find
the
bottle
verison
of
this
anymore
did
they
all
change
to
the
nitrocan
well
anyway
who
cares
i
guess
this
is
down
right
terrific
nice
thick
head
on
this
beer
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
to
the
last
drop
smell
consists
of
chocolate
duh
and
some
some
malts
underneath
taste
was
super
nice
chocolate
flavor
with
a
little
hop
bite
quite
creamy
but
just
a
little
thin
but
thats
ok
a
little
bitterness
aftertaste
and
can
still
taste
some
of
that
chocolate
at
the
end
too
very
nice
coco
stout
elegant
25
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
and
opaque
black
with
an
enormous
cocoa
head
globs
of
cocoa
lacing
are
left
down
the
glass
aroma
screams
chocolate
with
burnt
dark
grain
in
the
background
velvety
smooth
rich
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
adequate
but
subdued
carbonation
sweet
dark
chocolate
kicks
off
the
taste
a
complex
mix
of
roasted
coffee
and
more
chocolate
seem
to
be
the
backbone
but
some
fine
english
hops
bitterness
never
let
this
become
overly
sweet
very
tasty
and
finishes
with
a
bittersweet
chocolate
note
a
very
well
crafted
stout
that
has
lots
of
character
my
fridge
is
too
cold
to
keep
beer
as
i
barely
smell
or
taste
much
at
first
and
the
body
seems
rather
thin
for
a
stout
crystal
and
dark
malts
sneak
up
on
my
palate
only
after
a
swallow
then
the
roasted
barley
bite
keeps
me
trying
for
a
while
but
no
im
sorry
lost
interest
about
a
third
of
the
way
in
the
beer
is
a
highly
flavorful
one
but
remains
pretty
light
the
body
is
medium
with
a
cream
like
buttery
texture
to
it
roasted
bitter
finish
im
a
sucker
for
the
nitro
can
this
is
a
real
beauty
of
a
beer
nitro
or
not
black
pour
with
a
generous
tan
head
the
nose
is
nicely
highlighted
by
cocoa
and
mild
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
cocoa
and
light
unsweetened
chocolate
semibitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
lacked
body
richness
as
for
being
a
double
chocolate
stout
i
would
say
that
rogue
and
storm
king
live
up
to
that
name
sake
more
so
than
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
poor
bc
if
i
want
a
stout
i
dont
really
want
something
this
light
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
thick
and
rich
beer
it
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
perhaps
going
best
with
some
strong
cheeses
very
drinkable
for
so
hearty
a
brew
the
double
chocolate
stout
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
not
as
thick
and
balanced
as
id
hoped
and
i
didnt
really
detect
much
chocolate
as
a
dessert
beer
it
was
interesting
but
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
as
well
drinkability
i
find
would
be
limited
due
to
the
sweetness
and
the
body
most
excellent
mildly
bitter
to
drink
malts
a
hint
of
licorice
and
a
savory
lingering
chocolate
aftertaste
a
delightful
glass
of
beer
almost
four
years
later
i
had
this
on
tap
at
coles
and
while
it
is
thick
foam
that
coats
the
mouth
and
there
is
chocolate
and
coffee
there
it
paled
the
new
ommegang
chocolate
and
rogue
imperial
porter
beautiful
chocolate
black
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
stuff
for
about
a
buck
50
awesome
this
is
a
jet
black
colour
with
a
lovely
beige
head
the
aromas
are
of
chocolate
and
roasty
toasty
malts
the
taste
is
chocolatey
and
caramely
with
some
lovely
roasted
malts
and
light
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
ohsoexcellent
and
the
drinkability
is
simply
out
of
this
world
awesome
stuff
plainly
i
love
this
beer
this
being
my
preferred
taste
i
can
drink
these
all
night
long
and
i
think
ill
do
just
that
it
finishes
like
godiva
liquor
sweet
and
chocolatey
drinkability
not
something
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
but
a
very
nice
offering
nonetheless
i
suppose
if
i
were
having
a
chocolatey
dessert
this
beer
would
match
quite
well
but
sitting
here
drinking
it
and
eating
a
piece
of
sharp
cheddar
cheese
its
not
quite
the
same
incredible
head
amazing
staying
power
as
expected
super
malty
nose
dark
look
like
you
couldnt
believe
smoothness
to
die
for
get
if
possible
on
draft
draft
can
or
plain
old
bottle
whatever
you
can
a
nearly
black
and
opaque
brew
with
a
very
thick
and
creamy
head
of
cremecolor
beautiful
beer
and
that
everlasting
nitrohead
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
but
not
as
much
so
as
to
sip
and
get
the
incredibly
creamy
mouthfeel
huge
toffee
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
good
deal
of
cocoa
and
some
mild
hops
roasted
malt
greets
your
taste
buds
and
of
course
the
generous
amounts
of
chocolate
and
toffee
a
nice
mild
english
bitterness
complements
these
perfectly
again
wonderfully
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
but
rich
for
an
english
beer
quite
drinkable
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
good
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
great
dessert
beer
on
the
same
note
a
pleasure
on
tap
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
i
loved
youngs
oatmeal
stout
so
thought
id
try
their
offering
in
the
gorgeous
purple
and
orange
can
it
soon
became
a
favorite
i
recently
tried
it
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
in
denver
and
it
is
even
better
on
tap
than
in
the
nitropack
can
especially
in
a
tall
yard
glass
talk
about
a
creamy
solid
foam
head
it
never
goes
away
the
massive
clouds
of
foaming
brew
forms
slowly
as
the
soft
brown
cascades
of
carbonation
struggle
to
the
top
when
the
beer
settles
down
it
is
an
opaque
coffee
brown

and
the
aroma
contains
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
surprisingly
the
taste
is
more
of
a
stout
experience
than
sweet
just
right
amazingly
good
okay
perfect
this
has
been
my
second
tasting
of
this
beer
and
either
the
beer
has
improved
a
lot
which
i
doubt
or
my
palate
has
improved
a
lot
we
will
go
with
number
2
i
had
the
pleasure
of
this
on
tap
at
the
blue
nile
in
mpls
dark
sultry
with
medium
off
white
head
the
smell
is
dark
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
sweet
milk
chocolate
i
sip
and
its
like
a
candy
bar
in
a
glass
yet
not
cloying
or
too
strong
i
have
had
this
from
a
bottle
and
it
was
not
nearly
so
balanced
or
choco
good
it
fills
and
coats
the
mouth
nicely
so
smooth
and
gentle
after
dinner
as
a
snack
this
one
is
so
nice
some
gentle
hops
hover
in
the
background
as
i
ponder
how
nice
to
be
alive
and
relax
with
youngs
d
c
s
this
beer
has
dethroned
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
and
rogue
chocolate
stout
as
my
favorite
chocolate
brew
at
6
99
for
a
four
pack
a
bit
expensive
for
a
college
student
but
im
sure
ill
be
buying
it
again
and
again
so
smooth
and
creamy
it
was
almost
like
having
a
serving
of
malty
choclate
mousse
this
is
an
oustanding
exceptional
brew
buy
some
now
and
enjoy
overall
definitely
a
cold
weather
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
cocoa
and
a
warm
blanket
my
first
sip
brings
a
silky
malt
taste
its
smooth
roasted
and
enjoyable
the
label
says
double
chocolate
yet
i
find
myself
searching
reaching
for
that
hint
of
chocolate
a
mere
kiss
will
do
this
is
a
very
fine
stout
however
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
my
overanticipation
i
have
to
admit
to
a
bit
of
disappointment
with
this
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
its
very
good
as
my
rating
suggests
its
just
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
it
had
a
wonderful
appearance
and
a
nice
smokeyroasted
taste
followed
by
a
truly
delightful
chocolaty
aftertaste
but
it
was
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
for
me
i
guess
after
some
of
the
wonderful
american
micro
brewed
stouts
ive
tried
im
just
partial
to
a
bigger
beer
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
am
looking
to
try
this
on
nitrotap
poured
from
a
classic
brown
youngs
bottle
with
the
purple
label
its
very
dark
brown
almost
black
the
head
was
minimal
at
the
beginning
and
gone
after
a
few
sips
the
aroma
is
mostly
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
the
taste
is
quite
chocolatey
but
somewhat
on
the
bland
side
inoffensive
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
the
mouthfeel
seemed
slightly
thin
for
a
stout
if
looking
for
a
chocolate
stout
id
pick
rogue
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
black
in
color
almost
opaque
big
foamy
tan
head
chocolate
is
first
to
the
nose
slight
fruit
scent
taste
is
wonderful
bittersweet
chocolate
and
chocolate
the
lable
doesnt
lie
but
there
is
some
complexity
there
great
dessert
and
summooth
oh
my
this
is
becoming
a
staple
in
my
diet
and
the
taste
really
grows
on
you
its
my
comfort
beer
one
of
the
best
nitro
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
a
rich
and
delicious
chocolate
make
this
a
real
treat
quite
good
and
certainly
one
that
ill
have
again
id
be
very
hesitant
to
call
this
strictly
a
desert
beer
as
it
would
go
well
with
hearty
meals
too
its
very
drinkable
and
will
probably
find
a
permanent
home
in
my
fridge
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
as
the
title
suggests
its
a
dark
warm
chocolate
malty
beer
pouring
it
into
the
glass
a
tan
brown
head
rises
graciously
to
the
top
of
the
glass
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
as
it
generally
runs
down
into
the
glass
forming
a
dark
black
beer
at
first
taste
this
beer
might
seem
too
sweet
especially
for
nonstout
drinkers
however
the
aftertaste
has
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
to
make
this
otherwise
all
malt
flavor
very
drinkable
although
it
is
a
very
heavy
beer
it
is
easy
to
down
about
three
of
these
especially
since
the
abv
is
pretty
low
notes
my
favorite
beer
period
and
im
sure
there
are
tons
of
better
beers
out
there
but
i
havent
tried
them
yet
heh
this
is
an
awesome
beer
to
introduce
to
people
who
think
that
budweiser
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
beers
even
people
who
hate
beer
love
this
stuff
pours
a
midnight
black
with
light
tan
head
first
thought
with
the
aroma
was
mint
chocolate
chip
ice
cream
in
a
glass
further
aroma
noted
was
some
light
roasted
coffee
notes
and
touch
of
hop
profile
first
taste
was
milk
chocolate
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
coffee
taste
definitely
real
chocolate
in
there
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
chocolate
somewhat
detracts
from
the
other
flavors
that
are
in
there
simply
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
im
sure
it
is
the
classic
example
of
this
style
an
additional
note
ive
had
this
in
both
bottle
and
can
form
and
personally
feel
that
this
stout
is
better
from
the
can
not
only
do
you
get
the
nitro
charge
but
the
taste
out
of
the
can
is
better
creamy
smooth
and
rich
feel
incredibly
drinkable
especially
after
a
day
of
shoveling
snow
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
hint
of
light
coming
through
here
and
there
nice
frothy
head
that
held
and
laced
well
aroma
was
not
released
until
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
i
then
could
smell
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
hops
were
present
but
barely
detectable
taste
was
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
nice
hop
finish
beer
was
a
lot
thinner
than
i
had
imagined
this
is
very
drinkable
stout
and
not
as
intimidating
as
one
might
think
highly
drinkable
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
is
a
pretty
good
version
ill
definitely
have
it
again
note
to
self
next
time
let
it
warm
to
near
room
temperature
for
maximum
enjoyment
tastes
smoky
and
creamy
smooth
and
milky
with
underlying
sweet
chocolate
flavors
milk
chocolate
is
what
i
am
tasting
slightly
bitter
as
it
warms
a
dry
finish
and
the
bitterness
lingers
after
the
swallow
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
very
smooth
and
sweet
a
really
good
stout
and
thats
always
a
good
thing
ng
notes
far
from
the
decadently
or
sickly
sweet
afterdinner
beer
some
would
make
it
out
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
this
beer
is
rapidly
moving
up
my
favorite
beer
rankings
its
so
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
great
with
a
variety
of
desserts
a
superb
beer
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
from
this
brew
but
it
let
me
down
a
little
dont
get
me
wrong
ill
buy
this
beer
again
now
that
it
is
regularly
available
here
in
wichita
but
it
really
didnt
bowl
me
over
like
i
was
expecting
it
to
the
mouthfeel
was
lacking
and
the
flavor
had
too
much
tartness
for
this
type
of
beer
i
have
paired
this
brew
with
vanilla
ice
cream
and
coffee
very
nicely
as
a
dessert
it
is
a
very
good
brew
to
convert
non
beer
drinkers
although
not
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
this
stout
ranks
high
on
my
list
the
flavors
scents
and
textures
are
right
this
beer
needs
a
kick
of
hops
or
something
to
make
it
truly
incredible
hand
the
recipe
to
larry
bell
and
he
would
make
it
perfect
just
my
opinion
good
with
pastries
etc
not
the
cloying
chocolate
of
some
similar
beers
this
was
definitely
not
what
i
expected
i
expected
a
lot
of
chocolate
but
did
not
find
that
i
got
a
lot
of
burnt
coffee
flavors
and
some
sweet
malt
but
no
chocolate
it
wasnt
even
in
the
nose
the
apperance
was
wonderful
nice
head
and
dark
color
drinkablity
was
not
very
good
since
the
flavor
was
off
it
had
an
almost
metallic
taste
that
really
turned
me
off
one
of
my
bigger
disappointments
in
tasting
new
beers
color
was
ok
small
head
malt
aroma
with
the
smallest
hint
of
chocolate
taste
was
about
the
same
and
that
started
drying
out
pretty
quick
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
chocolate
beer
let
alone
a
double
in
addition
to
that
it
seemed
highly
charged
with
carbonation
i
had
two
bottles
of
this
and
both
were
the
same
drinkability
quite
intriguing
but
not
for
me
the
real
dark
chocolate
both
enhances
and
takes
away
from
this
one
imo
classic
nitro
pour
with
a
huge
lasting
tan
cascade
that
settled
atop
a
viscous
looking
black
body
smell
was
a
cross
between
sweet
creme
and
the
inside
of
a
chocolate
chip
package
so
much
sweetness
the
taste
was
astounding
it
was
like
drinking
a
carbomb
without
worrying
about
the
alcohol
at
all
it
had
huge
flavors
of
caramel
drizzled
cappucino
extra
sweet
chocolate
milkshake
no
astringent
grains
at
all
this
was
pure
velvet
and
a
perfect
after
dinner
drink
drinkability
is
a
little
low
as
the
amount
of
this
i
could
drink
is
very
small
before
i
develop
a
major
cavity
drinkability
smoothness
and
low
abv
make
for
an
easy
session
if
i
had
the
bucks
id
make
a
long
winter
evening
of
it
this
is
just
an
outstanding
chocolate
stout
s
d
dark
as
motoroil
definitely
darker
than
their
oatmeal
stout
nice
thick
cream
colored
head
its
got
a
kind
of
coco
powder
and
roasted
barley
smell
to
it
wow
it
really
is
chocolaty
i
had
this
one
on
tap
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
couldnt
taste
any
this
is
like
the
godiva
of
beers
silky
smooth
nitrogen
and
creamy
milk
chocalate
goodness
doesnt
have
any
bitterness
to
it
making
it
that
much
more
drinkable
this
in
one
fine
beer
so
smooth
and
rich
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
oatmeal
stout
that
i
just
drank
you
might
not
want
to
drink
this
right
after
a
big
meal
but
thats
about
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
it
pours
black
and
thick
with
the
beautiful
cascade
action
smells
of
chocolates
roasted
goodness
big
chocolate
taste
slightly
sweet
and
very
creamy
balanced
and
delicious
very
smooth
and
tastey
its
a
deadly
combo
i
prefer
the
can
over
the
bottle
and
it
isnt
too
expensive
for
a
high
quality
brew
being
1
99
a
bottlecan
or
6
bucks
a
4
pack
good
stuff
there
is
one
other
thing
this
beer
is
good
for
in
addition
to
drinking
i
make
mud
cake
with
this
in
it
and
let
me
say
it
rocks
black
color
a
medium
sized
cascading
head
aroma
is
chocolaty
nice
a
chocolaty
like
drinking
a
chocolate
milkshake
except
it
a
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
malts
is
intensified
by
the
additions
of
real
dark
chocolate
sweet
and
malty
yet
there
is
some
hop
bite
very
smooth
creamy
tasting
stout
great
desert
beer
or
a
great
stout
on
a
cool
winter
evening
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
sampled
this
last
evening
at
a
local
restaurant
big
chocolate
looking
head
and
aroma
roasted
malt
and
some
english
hops
i
liked
this
one
alot
due
to
its
somewhat
unusual
taste
compared
with
my
usual
standbys
i
e
victory
storm
king
sn
etc
very
malty
and
semi
sweet
very
tasty
and
bold
hints
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
all
over
goes
down
so
easily
its
scary
be
warned
this
one
will
quickly
become
one
of
your
standbys
if
you
are
into
stouts
a
fine
example
of
the
style
nice
semidry
finish
leaving
you
wanting
more
hmm
i
think
ill
have
another
one
real
soon
poured
from
that
hardy
500
ml
youngs
embossed
brown
bottle
it
is
a
velvet
pitch
black
creamy
tan
head
that
gracefully
falls
down
to
a
thin
cap
nose
is
of
powdered
cocoa
and
bakers
chocolate
with
a
foundation
of
roasted
malt
goodness
flavour
is
a
silky
combination
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
no
more
or
less
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
it
will
cure
whatever
ails
you
probably
the
easiest
way
ive
ever
known
to
convert
nearly
anyone
over
to
stouts
or
beer
in
general
there
are
angels
in
heaven
earning
their
wings
from
the
production
of
this
double
chocolate
stout
pours
a
nice
black
red
comes
through
when
held
up
to
light
with
a
lovely
thick
rockyfrothy
tan
head
the
very
persistent
head
leaves
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
and
greets
the
mouth
in
taking
a
drink
as
expected
from
the
name
a
fairly
strong
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
comes
forth
as
the
glass
is
raised
tastes
of
chocolate
malt
with
some
very
pleasant
sweetnessnot
overly
sweet
as
one
might
expect
from
double
chocolate
but
well
balanced
some
flavors
of
roasting
are
also
present
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
which
feels
slightly
oily
in
the
mouth
while
not
a
beer
for
consuming
following
working
outside
or
perhaps
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
highly
drinkable
as
an
after
dinner
desert
type
beer
and
is
an
outstanding
accompaniment
to
chocolate
cream
oreos
nitro
can
pour
black
with
a
creamy
head
looks
good
smells
of
chocolate
and
some
roast
malt
taste
is
exceptional
with
a
sweet
maltiness
subdued
by
a
somewhat
bitter
coco
chocolaty
flavor
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
bitter
chocolate
are
balanced
perfectly
with
the
chocolate
taste
coming
out
as
the
winner
almost
like
drinking
a
cold
hot
chocolate
without
all
the
sugar
and
some
alcohol
dropped
in
to
boot
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
could
be
enjoyed
all
day
ya
cant
miss
the
purple
lable
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
roasted
chocolate
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolates
cocoa
powder
and
had
some
musty
appeal
to
it
as
well
the
tastes
were
creamy
and
rich
flavors
of
chocolate
milk
hit
me
first
then
slowly
the
roasted
coffee
came
to
the
front
as
well
as
some
bitter
hops
and
bitter
chocolate
then
roasted
and
slightly
burnt
chocolate
came
in
as
well
as
roasted
dark
malts
i
also
detected
some
faint
fruits
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
taste
was
mostly
dominated
by
chocolate
and
coffee
roasted
the
aftertaste
was
on
the
bitter
side
coffee
and
chocolate
and
slightly
dry
this
beer
was
light
to
medium
bodied
over
all
a
good
combination
of
sweet
roasted
creamy
flavors
in
one
glass
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
represents
its
style
well
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
to
see
in
this
beer
is
more
body
alittle
thicker
i
would
definitely
get
again
plus
i
like
the
idea
that
it
is
in
a
can
so
that
it
can
go
almost
anywhere
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
initial
smell
of
chocolate
hits
right
before
taking
that
first
sip
already
bringing
a
smile
to
my
face
the
head
tastes
just
as
creamy
as
it
looks
the
slightly
sweet
cream
is
then
followed
by
a
bittersweet
chocolate
that
works
very
well
together
i
had
a
tough
time
keeping
it
in
my
mouth
due
to
the
big
goofy
smile
this
beer
put
on
my
face
to
much
fun
to
drink
black
in
color
with
a
nice
size
head
that
has
a
cascading
effect
both
the
aroma
and
taste
is
all
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
it
actually
has
a
way
of
coating
the
mouth
with
chocolate
im
not
a
big
fan
of
using
chocolate
in
beer
but
this
is
outstanding
a
nice
stout
a
fun
beer
it
feels
crisp
and
watery
with
a
fine
drinkability
i
like
this
stout
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
did
over
and
over
and
over
an
excellent
beer
its
thick
and
dark
with
a
big
brownish
head
that
hangs
around
throughout
the
pint
the
aroma
is
inviting
with
its
sweet
chocolately
coffee
aroma
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
that
complements
the
robust
chocolatiness
of
this
stout
once
the
sweetness
wears
off
there
is
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
hops
that
seemed
almost
nonexistant
during
the
beginning
of
the
sip
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
the
nose
is
of
chocolate
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
good
there
is
a
good
balance
between
base
and
specialty
grains
the
chocolate
taste
is
present
but
not
overpowering
the
thick
head
adds
a
creamy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
great
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
a
real
drinker
an
excellant
stout
what
a
great
looking
beer
big
head
but
not
out
of
control
and
a
dark
chocolaty
appearance
hence
the
name
taste
is
dominated
by
chocolate
name
again
but
other
flavors
are
there
i
detect
roasted
grains
in
it
along
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
it
seems
thin
for
a
stout
but
it
is
also
creamy
which
i
like
a
good
beer
for
dessert
or
any
time
a
chocolate
craving
hits
dark
black
beer
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
subsided
quickly
aroma
is
very
mild
with
roast
malt
and
chocolate
the
most
apparent
taste
is
very
intriguing
yet
seems
to
lack
the
luxury
the
label
proclaims
rich
chocolate
with
roast
barley
and
a
touch
of
hops
this
beer
should
be
on
nitro
to
showcase
the
flavors
for
the
bottled
version
the
carbonic
acid
produced
by
artificial
carbonation
fights
the
smoothness
and
makes
this
a
rougher
beer
than
it
should
be
this
stout
poured
from
nitrotap
a
jet
black
color
with
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
modest
but
distinct
dark
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
cocoa
and
a
low
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
tastes
of
burnt
grain
fruity
hops
and
a
chocolatey
finish
a
bit
perfume
like
as
well
this
nice
stout
pours
out
of
the
nitro
can
a
light
brown
color
but
fades
to
an
opaque
black
color
as
the
head
slowly
builds
like
a
reverse
waterfall
atop
it
is
a
12
inch
creamy
tan
head
it
has
a
nice
chocolate
aroma
its
a
very
smooth
creamy
tasting
beer
with
loads
of
roasted
chocolate
flavors
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
a
very
nice
chocolaty
aroma
arose
from
my
pour
of
a
brown
head
full
of
large
bubbles
and
a
opaque
dark
brown
body
that
left
a
clinging
lacing
as
it
receded
down
the
side
of
my
glass
ultra
smooth
initial
taste
followed
by
a
mild
chocolaty
sweet
aftertaste
it
was
extremely
smooth
and
very
much
to
my
liking
wow
dont
plan
on
tossing
back
a
lot
of
these
its
really
more
a
desert
beer
best
to
open
this
one
at
cellar
temperature
i
had
mine
in
the
fridge
when
i
opened
it
it
still
hadnt
warmed
up
to
the
right
temperature
yet
and
took
until
midglass
for
the
flavor
to
be
appreciable
it
had
a
nice
tan
head
with
good
lacing
not
much
scent
beyond
dark
malt
it
was
still
a
little
too
cold
by
mid
glass
you
could
notice
a
chocolaty
scent
in
the
background
creamy
mouthfeel
as
one
would
expect
with
this
kind
of
beer
when
warmed
up
to
proper
temp
has
a
nice
toasty
malt
flavor
and
there
is
a
very
tasty
chocolate
flavor
in
the
background
and
in
the
aftertaste
there
was
a
hop
presence
but
it
is
relatively
subtle
reccomended
after
a
nice
satisfying
meal
i
like
this
beer
i
happen
to
like
rogues
chocolate
offering
better
this
is
as
close
to
a
candy
bar
as
beer
could
be
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
for
overall
effect
this
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
on
the
other
hand
the
taste
is
excellent
and
the
drinkability
high
if
you
like
em
sweet
this
will
do
originally
sampled
on
3
may
2003
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
thiss
starts
out
w
all
the
right
intentions
but
disappoints
at
the
end
it
starts
w
a
nice
chocolate
nose
tan
head
w
a
dark
body
and
some
up
front
chocolate
flavor
but
finishes
a
bit
thin
an
watery
the
body
of
this
beer
is
too
thin
to

tart
a
reddish
black
brew
with
purple
head
appear
aroma
is
raspberry
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
full
body
supports
a
chocolate
covered
raspberry
flavor
that
finishes
with
sweet
roasted
malt
to
make
a
dessert
beer
better
fruit
chocolate
delicious
highly
worth
the
effort
smuggled
a
couple
pint
bottles
into
utah
two
weeks
ago
and
finally
drank
one
last
night
had
high
expectations
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
medium
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
dominated
by
chocolate
shocker
wow
a
little
too
cold
to
start
with
not
much
carbonation
taste
is
also
dominated
by
chocolate
and
sweet
roasty
goodness
very
smoothexceptionally
smooth
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
such
a
sweet
chocolatey
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
kalamazoo
and
the
many
imperials
i
love
this
stout
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
small
ring
the
nose
features
notes
of
caramel
roasted
malt
and
surprisingly
chocolate
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
taste
is
divine
albeit
somewhat
onedimensional
dark
chocolate
is
the
main
event
here
although
notes
of
caramel
cream
and
sugar
run
their
courses
as
well
drinking
this
is
almost
reminiscent
of
sipping
a
chocolate
malt
the
feel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
velvety
only
minimal
carbonation
is
present
here
and
its
hard
to
detect
for
a
stout
with
so
much
chocolate
character
i
thought
this
might
be
too
much
to
handle
but
upon
review
its
quite
drinkable
and
a
real
treat
overall
luxurious
indeed
this
beer
was
a
true
treat
it
was
a
creamy
beer
and
went
down
very
smooth
the
taste
was
exceptional
and
lasted
all
the
way
through
the
drink
the
chocolate
flavor
added
a
lot
to
the
beer
id
drink
it
again
anytime
the
price
wasnt
too
bad
for
the
size
of
the
bottle
a
most
drinkable
stout
very
nice
stuff
indeed
i
had
to
put
my
two
cents
in
as
far
as
this
beer
is
concerned
with
respect
to
the
nitro
can
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
belittled
by
the
medium
in
which
it
is
served
the
draught
can
version
of
this
classic
stout
has
far
less
character
than
the
bottled
version
so
much
in
fact
that
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
baby
step
up
from
guiness
i
tried
this
twice
at
my
local
pub
to
be
resolute
in
my
decisioni
am
try
this
in
bottle
long
before
you
bother
with
the
nitro
can
i
respect
the
physics
of
the
nitro
can
and
belive
it
should
be
reserved
for
guiness
and
massmarketed
english
pub
ales
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
delicate
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
chocolate
and
malt
dominate
the
taste
now
this
one
goes
down
smooth
with
just
the
right
combination
of
hops
malt
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
i
had
this
in
a
5l
bottle
poured
into
a
youngs
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
black
with
a
nice
1
finger
of
tan
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
head
dies
down
a
bit
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
delicate
mix
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
a
bit
chocolatey
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
with
only
a
small
bit
of
hops
in
the
back
there
is
a
bit
of
a
coffee
taste
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
soft
for
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
stout
though
this
really
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
what
an
awsome
stout
this
is
beautiful
dark
chocobrown
body
with
tight
fluffy
beige
head
smell
is
immediately
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
smooth
as
silk
on
the
palate
and
clings
to
the
inside
of
your
mouth
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
with
hop
overtones
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
cool
cascading
effect
very
smooth
and
tasty
with
a
creamy
head
this
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
chocolate
is
very
evident
in
the
flavor
which
i
love
i
would
like
to
have
this
beer
again
and
again
because
it
is
so
drinkable
and
smooth
i
love
it
pours
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
it
forms
a
thick
creamy
light
brown
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
just
hits
you
with
a
huge
fudge
dark
chocolate
smell
there
is
a
bit
of
roasty
malt
and
alcohol
in
the
end
the
flavor
is
wonderful
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
up
front
then
quickly
you
are
hit
wit
the
sweet
dark
chocolate
flavor
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
with
smooth
silky
texture
and
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
would
be
great
with
desserts
this
beer
pours
a
clear
very
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
very
creamy
luxurious
moderately
large
tan
head
the
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
and
oily
quite
nice
the
smell
is
a
tempting
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
a
very
mild
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
that
makes
a
wonderul
drink
after
a
meal
yet
i
could
probablythough
i
have
never
tried
drink
it
all
night
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
ive
had
it
in
the
nitrocan
too
and
it
was
not
enhanced
by
that
gimmick
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
as
long
as
i
didnt
stick
my
nose
in
it
to
smell
it
overall
ok
not
bad
but
not
great
color
of
this
yummy
chocolate
is
deep
brown
almost
black
like
a
dark
chocolate
candy
nice
tan
head
frothy
foam
about
a
finger
high
fades
a
little
leaving
patchy
lace
smells
of
very
sweet
and
rich
chocolate
with
a
nice
creamy
lightness
notes
of
ginger
spice
and
nuts
taste
echoes
the
smell
its
got
a
good
amount
of
chocolaty
flavor
thats
sweetly
bitter
but
not
overbearing
it
stays
nice
and
silky
smooth
the
whole
way
through
with
a
good
chocolatey
twinge
thats
quite
nice
in
the
finish
and
feel
some
faint
notes
of
hop
presence
and
ginger
and
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
this
is
a
great
stout
for
having
around
halloween
and
the
winter
holidays
when
everyone
starts
eating
more
sweets
super
yummy
stuff
overall
it
was
definitely
an
intensely
enjoyable
experience
the
chocolate
was
pleasantly
present
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
without
overpowering
the
malts
after
a
few
bottles
ive
come
to
enjoy
it
even
more
this
beer
has
entered
my
regular
rotation
as
one
of
my
favourites
and
i
expect
itll
stay
there
for
quite
some
time
this
is
such
a
great
and
complex
stout
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
1inch
head
the
head
slowly
fades
down
leaving
a
nice
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
are
full
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
complements
the
aroma
perfectly
theres
a
slight
bitterness
upon
first
taste
but
it
matched
exquisitely
with
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
this
beer
is
exceptionally
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
its
absolutely
delicious
feels
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
just
not
too
many
at
once
ill
be
getting
a
sixer
next
since
the
one
i
tried
was
just
a
pint
bottle
black
actually
very
dark
ruby
with
a
good
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
all
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
when
you
expect
something
cloyingly
sweet
chocolate
in
beer
uff
da
surprise
a
perfectly
rounded
and
well
balanced
flavour
loads
of
chocolate
but
never
sickly
just
the
right
roasted
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
each
and
every
afternoon
but
just
one
bottle
a
day
pour
is
deep
black
large
medium
brown
head
slowly
diminishes
to
leave
good
lacing
aroma
is
strong
on
the
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malts
in
the
back
flavor
starts
almost
like
hot
chocolate
ends
with
some
mild
roasted
bitter
maltiness
body
is
full
and
strong
not
something
i
would
drink
every
night
but
quite
a
tasty
brew
eh
this
was
ok
the
look
was
great
the
smell
was
great
then
there
was
the
taste
there
was
no
taste
what
so
ever
i
got
nothing
out
of
this
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
something
but
i
was
very
disappointed
it
was
kind
of
waterd
down
tasteing
but
had
some
hints
of
maltiness
other
than
that
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
say
very
deep
dark
reddish
brown
appearance
poured
from
an
equally
dark
and
beautifully
shaped
and
labeled
bottle
no
head
to
speak
of
but
what
little
was
there
was
tan
and
thin
this
is
a
very
chocalately
beer
as
would
be
expected
from
its
name
the
label
boasts
silky
smooth
rich
and
creamy
and
that
is
no
overstatement
this
is
very
rich
beer
with
a
clean
chocolate
sense
in
both
taste
and
smell
the
unexpected
finish
comes
from
a
strong
final
rush
hop
bitterness
much
less
than
expected
aftertaste
we
drank
this
after
a
nice
meal
and
found
it
to
be
a
perfect
desert
finish
to
the
evening
surprisingly
enjoyable
after
an
initial
sense
of
being
too
sweet
taste
again
the
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
bitter
after
taste
some
coffie
flavors
did
come
out
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
chocolate
roasted
flavor
not
bad
in
taste
but
nothing
worth
buying
again
it
did
go
down
smooth
over
all
a
o
k
stout
after
reading
the
other
reviews
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
will
try
it
again
to
be
fair
on
another
happy
note
though
my
fathernlaw
enjoyed
it
what
does
that
mean
well
to
put
it
bluntly
hes
a
budman
i
try
to
get
him
to
taste
beers
with
me
but
he
normally
sticks
to
the
norm
maybe
with
this
there
will
be
some
hope
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
a
deep
black
stout
the
head
is
tan
not
very
tall
but
thick
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
is
very
slight
it
takes
a
lot
and
huffing
and
puffing
to
get
a
sense
of
the
beer
the
chocolate
taste
is
there
but
to
me
this
beer
is
dominated
by
a
smoky
almost
burnt
malt
taste
not
as
smooth
as
others
of
the
style
ive
had
with
some
prickly
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
there
but
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
the
first
sip
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
easier
to
drink
than
water
and
if
i
could
breathe
it
i
probably
would
its
extreme
chocolate
flavor
is
its
savior
and
its
lone
problem
there
are
simply
times
when
chocolate
doesnt
go
with
what
youre
eating
or
times
when
it
gets
a
little
too
sweet
for
taste
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
one
of
the
better
chocolate
stouts
available
a
creamy
dark
beige
nitro
head
sits
regally
upon
an
opaque
dark
brown
black
throne
and
refuses
to
abdicate
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
solomonlike
balance
of
dark
malt
and
semisweet
chocolate
with
fleeting
notes
of
cherry
raspberry
and
burnt
metal
the
head
leaves
clingy
tendrils
down
the
glass
as
you
drink
as
it
warms
expresso
flavors
join
the
malt
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
thin
almost
watery
with
little
carbonation
some
other
reviewers
think
this
brew
is
too
sweet
or
gimmicky
but
i
am
not
one
of
them
one
of
my
current
favorites
personal
notes
i
expected
this
to
be
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
there
is
nothing
really
in
excess
here
but
rather
lots
of
flavor
in
the
right
amounts
i
already
reviewed
the
bottle
this
can
obviously
makes
the
nitro
cascading
effect
and
a
wonderful
thick
offwhite
head
the
liquid
is
opaque
this
stout
is
so
super
smooth
i
yearned
for
stronger
chocolate
in
the
bottle
and
i
yearn
for
it
here
too
the
bottle
seemed
to
have
more
overall
flavor
in
it
this
can
seems
kind
of
bland
in
a
way
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
nothing
about
this
beer
is
strong
and
that
is
definitely
a
plus
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
i
could
easily
and
probably
will
drink
the
three
other
cans
right
after
this
one
a
great
stout
to
have
with
desert
or
as
desert
the
smell
is
rich
of
chocolate
of
course
p
coffee
and
raisins
after
the
first
sip
i
noticed
it
had
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
it
too
not
too
surprising
was
it
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
either
its
very
balanced
in
this
matter
the
most
significant
tastes
is
chocolate
and
coffee
very
thick
pleasant
mouthfeel
drinkability
since
this
is
such
a
wellbalanced
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
the
combination
of
the
chocolate
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
complement
each
other
nicely
overall
just
a
notch
below
the
imperial
stouts
in
my
book
love
the
look
of
a
black
stout
as
it
settles
and
this
brew
does
that
nicely
thick
tan
shaving
cream
head
and
deep
brown
black
body
the
smell
not
surprisingly
is
of
chocolate
what
is
different
about
this
chocolate
brew
and
others
is
that
neither
the
smell
nor
the
flavor
goes
overboard
with
the
chocolate
the
other
noticeable
characteristic
in
both
flavor
and
smell
was
malt
again
not
over
powering
in
either
the
only
weekness
for
this
brew
is
in
its
mouthfeel
i
like
a
stout
to
feel
thick
in
the
mouth
and
this
brew
seemed
slightly
on
the
watery
side
this
however
is
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
solid
stout
cheers
this
is
a
terrific
chocolate
stout
i
find
myself
thinking
of
this
beer
often
and
can
remember
its
chocolaty
flavor
days
later
it
reminds
me
so
much
of
chocolate
milk
that
i
forget
im
drinking
a
stout
pours
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
has
a
thin
but
persistent
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
my
glass
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
with
an
abundance
of
chocolate
almost
smells
like
malted
ovaltine
flavor
is
a
wonderful
mixture
of
malty
sweetness
and
slightly
bitter
chocolate
very
smooth
and
rich
hops
play
a
role
of
balance
barely
noticeable
but
doing
thier
job
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
full
bodied
an
excellent
dessert
beer
a
guinness
with
some
chocolate
flavoring
is
my
overall
impression
nothing
fancy
for
a
stout
but
drinkable
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
somewhat
opaque
dark
brown
to
black
nice
brown
head
i
detect
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
smells
like
chocolate
milk
with
alcohol
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
had
anticipated
tastes
much
more
like
dark
bitter
chocolate
although
some
milk
chocolate
sweetness
is
present
malt
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
although
the
sweetness
edges
out
the
bitterness
in
this
battle
good
mouthfeel
not
overly
sweet
with
good
drinkability
id
actually
like
to
see
a
little
more
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
in
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
vertical
pour
of
this
slightly
less
than
ruby
redjetblack
liquid
forms
a
beautiful
yeasty
thick
meringue
pancake
of
a
head
beautiful
to
watch
the
downpour
of
thin
bubbles
sheet
down
the
glass
low
on
carbonation
or
should
i
say
nitrogenation
as
most
nitrocanned
ales
are
aroma
is
suprisingly
close
to
guinness
nitrocan
with
an
added
dose
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
mmmm
velvety
smooth
texture
amazingly
rich
pillowsoft
mouthfeel
crisp
clean
finish
with
a
hint
of
grain
freshly
shelled
walnuts
and
cocoa
powder
hops
are
only
there
to
balance
never
becoming
intrusive
the
only
downside
to
this
heavenly
brew
is
the
subtle
metallic
and
cardboard
notes
in
the
aftertaste
these
become
more
prominent
as
the
brew
warms
but
dont
really
become
a
bother
thank
god
they
are
only
subtle
for
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
sticky
lace
that
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
while
drinking
nose
is
fresh
coffee
sweet
roasted
malts
and
milk
chocolate
smooth
creamy
thick
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
sweet
maltiness
a
very
nice
stout
that
goes
great
with
dessert
pretty
nice
pour
deep
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
dense
velvety
mocha
colored
head
the
head
hangs
in
at
about
14
inch
and
doesnt
change
until
i
drink
it
up
at
the
end
of
the
glass
smells
like
baileys
irish
cremechocolate
milk
with
an
alcohol
kick
tastes
of
semisweet
chocolate
some
malt
character
too
as
the
beer
warms
closer
to
room
temperature
the
tastes
intensify
a
little
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
for
such
a
rich
looking
brew
and
carbonation
is
low
a
good
dessert
beer
it
was
incredibly
silky
in
the
mouth
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
the
beer
was
more
like
chocolate
soda
or
yoohoo
then
i
remember
the
last
time
i
had
this
one
was
early
in
my
days
of
drinking
good
beer
it
seems
my
memory
of
this
one
are
better
than
the
real
thing
but
thats
fine
with
me
this
was
still
a
different
enjoyable
stout
i
recently
tried
rogues
chocolate
stout
and
was
really
impressed
however
this
one
blew
that
out
of
the
water
the
main
reason
for
this
was
probably
the
nitro
charger
in
the
can
which
gave
the
beer
a
icecreamish
mouthfeel
and
also
lended
to
quite
a
show
while
waiting
for
the
head
to
form
in
the
glass
which
remained
the
entire
time
and
was
very
creamy
definite
chocolate
taste
especially
in
the
beginning
slight
bitterness
showing
towards
the
end
but
overall
quite
a
treat
as
one
user
described
rogues
stout
as
chocolate
milk
for
adult
i
would
describe
this
as
the
chocolate
shake
for
adults
pours
almost
completely
black
with
just
hints
of
rubyamber
on
the
edges
a
substantial
foamy
tan
head
with
some
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
creamy
chocolate
scents
with
a
hint
of
underlying
roasted
notes
taste
is
quite
sweet
throughout
the
drink
starting
rather
lighttextured
and
even
a
bit
hoppy
a
rich
taste
of
chocolate
truffles
comes
through
toward
the
end
culminating
with
some
dryness
as
in
the
smell
roasted
grains
are
present
but
somewhat
muted
the
light
but
rich
taste
and
dry
finish
lends
itself
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
betterthanaverage
drinkability
for
a
stout
double
chocolate
it
has
chocolate
but
i
always
want
more
beautiful
black
body
and
chocolate
aroma
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
chocolate
with
just
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
one
isnt
enough
id
like
another
the
nitro
can
version
of
this
stout
was
purchased
along
with
the
bottle
for
comparison
and
review
there
was
a
distinct
difference
in
taste
with
the
nitro
can
version
there
was
much
less
of
the
luxurious
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
chocolate
taste
the
can
version
was
good
in
its
own
right
but
drier
and
of
course
more
like
a
pub
poured
pint
it
also
seemed
less
complex
in
flavors
the
archetypal
stout
color
ebony
the
head
planetary
in
size
creamy
texture
and
the
lace
fine
sticky
sheets
to
cling
to
the
glass
a
nice
light
chocolate
color
for
both
the
aroma
of
coffee
toasted
grains
chocolate
and
sweet
as
can
be
quite
a
pleasure
start
is
sweet
the
top
thick
and
chewy
the
finish
passably
acidic
the
hops
pertinent
to
the
style
dry
long
lasting
aftertaste
and
a
world
class
stout
in
my
book
you
can
smell
chocalate
and
really
taste
it
with
the
first
sip
great
not
real
sweet
some
hops
in
the
finish
velvety
smooth
with
a
nice
creamy
silky
feel
on
the
palate
very
chocolatey
but
not
overdone
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
i
always
enjoy
it
smooth
creamy
and
silky
what
a
great
stout
not
an
overpowering
chocolate
flavor
as
it
does
not
come
until
the
end
very
dark
in
color
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
i
am
sure
that
this
would
be
even
better
on
tap
a
bit
dry
in
the
middle
but
evens
out
in
the
end
this
is
one
that
i
will
go
back
to
this
is
a
very
black
beer
there
is
a
14
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
this
beer
tastes
just
as
it
claims
to
be
chocolate
chocolate
and
more
chocolate
its
almost
like
drinking
a
chocolate
silk
pie
very
rich
but
not
sweet
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
for
a
stout
nice
lace
goes
down
the
bottle
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
just
the
name
of
this
beer
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
pours
a
deep
brown
colour
topped
by
a
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
consists
of
chocolate
malts
taste
couldnt
be
anything
else
but
chocolaty
chocolate
malts
dominate
the
taste
excellent
luxurious
brew
id
say
that
this
is
a
complex
yet
polite
stout
it
would
make
a
most
excellent
choice
for
a
dessert
beer
with
its
pleasant
chocolate
cake
after
taste
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
id
recommend
it
and
drink
it
again
most
likely
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
whitetan
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malt
nice
malt
flavors
with
chocolate
and
caramel
tones
a
little
bit
of
hops
a
very
good
stout
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
very
solid
stout
pours
black
as
night
no
light
can
come
through
big
creamy
tan
head
that
heaves
wispy
lacing
all
the
way
down
aromas
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
some
sweetness
that
goes
with
a
slightly
burntroasted
flavor
big
chocolate
flavour
not
milk
chocolate
but
dark
some
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
licorice
finishes
slightly
dry
very
easy
to
drink
incredible
the
stout
pours
inky
black
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
lingers
and
then
drops
back
to
a
generous
collar
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
chocolate
from
both
the
chocolate
malt
used
and
the
actual
chocolate
added
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
smooth
and
silky
chocolate
with
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
finish
to
balance
the
wonderful
sweet
flavors
in
the
beer
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
specialty
stout
for
cooler
temperatures
and
when
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
just
love
the
way
the
nitrocan
beers
seem
to
have
the
head
cascade
down
through
the
beer
and
back
up
to
the
top
the
head
on
this
beer
takes
well
over
a
minute
to
settle
out
from
the
nitro
can
and
it
stays
thick
and
creamy
throughout
the
entire
time
you
drink
it
when
it
is
too
cold
there
is
very
little
flavor
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
aromas
arise
the
flavor
exhibits
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
or
cocoa
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
a
very
thin
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
that
dark
chocolate
note
a
good
beer
with
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
presumed
it
would
have
which
is
a
good
thing
beautiful
chocolate
beer
here
just
made
for
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
on
top
not
sweet
except
for
a
supple
slither
of
alcohol
sweetness
in
the
midpalate
the
chocolate
is
of
the
hersheys
cocoa
variety
who
can
argue
with
chocolate
in
their
stout
especially
when
it
isnt
over
done
tried
this
beer
three
time
and
have
been
dissapointed
every
time
i
could
not
taste
anything
to
do
with
double
chocolate
or
infact
any
kind
of
chocolate
flavor
or
aroma
it
was
lacking
in
just
about
everything
is
there
something
im
missing
just
a
blah
brew
wheres
the
chocolate
double
this
is
really
good
stout
very
rich
appearance
nice
head
and
less
milky
than
other
stouts
a
strong
cocoa
aroma
sets
the
drinker
up
for
the
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
that
this
stout
is
named
for
very
smooth
glides
across
the
palate
this
is
great
all
around
stout
for
diehard
fans
or
first
timers
outstanding
head
all
canned
nitro
brews
are
like
this
right
smells
of
powdered
hot
chocolate
hint
of
alcohol
kiss
of
roasted
grain
and
some
sweetness
this
pretty
much
goes
the
same
for
the
flavour
but
add
a
vague
fruitiness
a
bitter
twang
from
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
and
a
remarkable
smoothness
i
prefer
this
on
tap
so
much
more
but
this
is
not
too
bad
great
color
thats
the
first
thing
i
noticed
so
dark
its
black
with
a
great
head
tannish
white
about
an
inch
that
stays
almost
to
the
bottom
a
true
bishops
collar
just
a
light
presence
of
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
a
little
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
lace
throughout
with
a
pretty
good
finish
a
good
example
of
the
style
much
more
enjoyable
than
a
guiness
this
pours
with
a
nice
looking
tan
head
over
deep
deep
brownishred
liquid
nose
is
predominately
roasted
malts
with
some
tanginess
noted
taste
is
roasty
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
notes
not
as
fullbodied
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
nice
nonetheless
finishes
a
bit
more
chocolaty
than
malty
no
real
hop
flavors
come
to
the
front
a
nice
beer
but
thats
about
it
black
as
night
with
a
delicious
chocolate
aroma
goes
down
rich
and
smooth
just
like
a
stout
should
with
a
creamy
goodness
then
you
get
a
blast
of
chocolate
that
just
hits
the
spot
theres
a
real
danger
of
overdoing
it
on
the
sweetness
in
a
drink
like
this
but
youngs
managed
to
balance
out
this
beer
quite
nicely
the
chocolate
is
wonderful
and
something
you
wont
find
in
many
other
beers
but
the
body
is
fairly
light
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
for
a
stout
and
the
finish
is
dryer
than
one
would
expect
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
something
billed
as
a
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
but
it
works
very
drinkable
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
all
night
i
have
been
looking
for
a
good
solid
robust
stout
for
a
long
time
and
i
figured
youngs
wouldnt
let
me
down
was
i
ever
right
the
deep
dark
color
and
thick
foamy
lasting
head
were
the
introduction
i
was
yearning
for
the
first
taste
of
this
heavy
bodied
brew
was
just
liquid
heaven
the
smooth
roasted
tootsie
roll
chocolate
flavor
is
jsut
what
i
was
hoping
for
and
made
my
day
the
mellow
latent
bitterness
helps
balance
out
the
sweet
to
create
a
fantastic
stout
toasted
but
not
so
intensive
you
can
found
in
the
smell
the
chocolate
but
you
must
drink
it
for
tasting
the
real
soul
of
this
beer
dark
and
bitter
chocolate
the
smell
is
not
particular
as
taste
but
when
you
drink
it
you
can
find
the
same
flavour
of
the
taste
pure
chocolate
great
after
looking
for
a
while
i
finally
found
myself
a
good
chocolate
stout
and
this
one
is
quality
the
appearance
is
what
you
would
expect
black
with
an
enormous
brown
fluffy
head
for
some
reason
i
found
the
smell
to
be
a
bit
off
and
imo
it
certainly
did
not
fit
with
the
thick
sweetness
of
the
beer
this
stuff
tastes
delicious
however
the
chocolate
is
clearly
present
as
is
a
sweet
flavor
of
coffee
and
vanilla
but
none
overpower
the
beer
and
its
smooth
as
silk
oooh
mama
a
local
resturant
has
this
beer
on
their
menu
and
its
become
one
of
my
favorite
afterdinner
beers
pours
nearly
black
with
a
respectable
lasting
head
that
produces
a
fair
amount
of
lace
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
rich
like
fudge
unquestionably
a
desert
beer
complex
and
enjoyable
but
not
for
every
occation
this
dark
ruby
colored
brew
pours
a
huge
brown
head
foamy
and
rocky
aroma
is
of
cocoa
bean
and
java
you
can
actually
taste
the
chocolate
in
this
brew
maybe
because
they
actually
use
real
chocolate
in
the
recipe
can
taste
baking
chocolate
bittersweet
is
predominant
coffee
and
vanilla
bean
tones
also
surface
pretty
light
in
body
for
a
stout
maybe
medium
at
best
i
used
to
think
more
highly
of
this
beer
years
ago
untill
i
started
getting
a
taste
of
what
the
truly
high
quality
stouts
taste
like
i
e
kalamazoo
after
a
bad
experience
with
breckenridges
chocolate
beer
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
trying
this
but
i
am
glad
i
did
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bottled
version
this
had
the
perfect
hint
of
chocolate
in
my
opinion
the
coloration
was
also
perfect
and
conveyed
what
to
expect
in
the
flavor
exactly
this
is
a
great
example
of
bold
flavor
with
subtle
accents
to
make
a
great
brew
while
stouts
are
not
my
fav
type
of
brew
i
loved
this
one
from
the
dark
brown
appearance
and
thick
foamy
head
to
the
sweet
choc
aroma
had
a
good
mouthfeel
and
i
can
see
why
they
call
it
double
choc
so
smooth
and
sweet
tasting
great
color
of
cans
also
clemson
colors
orange
and
purple
try
this
beer
its
great
cheers

black
with
moderate
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
more
of
roasted
coffee
and
the
chocolate
faded
to
the
background
as
the
beer
warms
the
chocolate
flavor
lessens
and
becomes
more
roasty
with
maltiness
coming
through
a
good
stout
although
i
do
not
like
it
as
well
as
my
drinking
buddy
bigemail
very
deep
opaque
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
holds
up
well
and
gives
some
nice
belgianlace
the
aroma
is
of
a
slightly
sweet
dark
malt
like
bittersweet
chocolate
the
medium
body
and
restrained
carbonation
level
give
a
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
very
lightly
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
roastiness
against
a
light
bitterness
well
balanced
but
somewhat
lacking
in
character
for
it
not
very
much
punch
the
finish
is
light
and
leaves
a
pleasant
lightly
dry
and
roasty
aftertaste
immensely
drinkable
i
once
felt
that
i
preferred
the
nitrocan
version
because
it
has
such
a
soft
silkysmooth
and
creamy
character
but
i
now
feel
that
the
bottled
version
is
more
enjoyable
as
it
appears
less
sweet
and
slightly
more
complex
now
were
talking
great
deep
dark
color
chocolate
malt
scent
like
a
guiness
with
hersheys
syrup
i
love
this
beer
very
smooth
as
well
not
something
you
want
to
drink
all
night
but
a
few
do
the
trick
chocolot
man
dude
wheres
my
chocolate
dude
its
in
my
beer
sweet
pours
a
very
very
dark
color
maybe
black
but
hard
to
tell
in
this
low
light
the
head
started
out
at
2
fingers
and
with
a
rather
dark
color
for
a
head
and
dissipated
fairly
quickly
the
smell
well
theres
definitely
chocolate
in
it
the
taste
well
theres
definitely
chocolate
in
it
and
surprisingly
it
is
rather
good
it
isnt
the
most
balanced
beer
and
as
rich
as
the
chocolate
is
i
would
have
to
stop
with
this
one
after
a
couple
or
four
it
was
a
pleasant
experience
for
a
change
chococheers
i
feel
like
the
grinch
on
this
one
this
was
a
very
sweettasting
beer
and
reminded
me
of
guinness
with
hersheys
syrup
mixed
in
great
aroma
and
appearance
so
ill
score
it
high
there
but
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
overwhelming
on
the
palate
if
you
like
chocolate
or
sweets
then
you
might
like
this
as
it
offers
a
range
of
tastes
that
run
the
gamut
from
bitter
to
sweet
by
and
large
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
on
the
market
the
chocolate
aroma
is
apparent
from
the
very
getgo
the
head
pours
nice
and
thick
and
stays
there
for
quite
some
time
this
brew
is
very
smooth
sweet
and
and
creamlike
in
its
consistency
this
is
what
i
like
to
call
a
knifeandfork
brew
it
is
the
beer
that
drinks
like
a
meal
i
agree
with
the
advocate
review
in
that
there
was
a
hint
of
licorice
towards
the
middle
of
the
glass
if
you
like
this
brew
and
even
better
if

at

local

emporium
like
shangys
here
in
pennsylvania
this
is
a
musttry
bottoms
up
frothy
tan
head
black
body
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
excellent
lacing
wonderful
aroma
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
licorice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
coffee
a
hop
tingle
joins
in
the
mouth
while
the
coffee
and
licorice
fade
away
but
it
is
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
which
dominate
the
taste
an
outstanding
dessert
beer
or
nightcap
chocolate
anyone
downward
cascading
interesting
to
watch
dark
brown
with
creamy
brown
head
and
lace
rich
creamy
chocolate
malt
almost
too
smooth
the
nitro
can
i
had
produce
a
beer
that
was
slightly
weak
and
flat
nevertheless
it
was
still
delicious
inpenetrable
black
color
big
foamy
head
that
died
quickly
nice
chocolate
malt
aroma
like
chocolate
cake
in
a
bottle
higher
than
expected
carbonation
makes
it
slightly
less
smooth
than
i
anticipated
not
very
complex
in
taste
just
a
slight
roasted
bitterness
on
top
of
a
big
bittersweet
chocolate
malt
profile
not
too
sweet
with
a
hop
bite
in
the
background
this
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
very
solid
nonetheless
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
chocolate
and
beer
which
i
am
would
be
delicious
as
a
dessert
beer
with
a
hershey
bar
just
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
had
another
one
this
could
turn
me
into
a
chocoholic
although
there
no
real
chocolate
is
used
in
the
making
of
this
flavorful
stout
plenty
of
chocolate
malt
is
starting
with
strong
roasted
flavors
and
a
good
balance
of
dryness
and
malt
the
chocolate
becomes
very
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
i
am
always
on
the
lookout
for
good
stouts
and
porters
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
chocolate
flavor
in
a
beer
but
i
still
found
this
to
be
a
good
beer
wonderful
dark
brown
almost
black
color
and
a
medim
tan
foamy
head
plus
an
interesting
smell
of
chocolate
that
was
almost
overpowering
the
body
was
a
bit
weaker
than
i
would
expect
for
this
type
and
the
flavor
was
overpowered
too
much
by
the
chocolate
in
my
opinion
i
thing
rogues
version
does
a
much
better
job
of
maintaining
a
balance
lots
of
chocolate
and
malt
flavours
a
good
beer
from
youngs
which
makes
up
for
all
there
bad
ones
quite
rich
not
too
complex
but
damn
tasty
if
youve
got
a
craving

zero
hop
cut
to
my
tongue
one
of
my
favorite
sweet
stouts
but
a
little
limiting
when
youre
seeking
out
complexity
more
nonbeer
drinkers
need
to
check
out
brews
like
this
presentation
package
reviewed
was
the
14
9
ounce
can
with
the

generator
served
in

nice

smooth

good

are
enhanced
as
it
warms
i
had
this
one
in
the
14
9
oz
can
with
the
widget
i
thought
it
was
great
pours
deep
jet
black
with
a
nice
big
creamy
tan
head
the
head
stayed
on
mine
until
the
end
falling
down
the
glass
perfectly
big
chocolate
flavor
didnt
really
notice
much
else
unbelievably
smooth
and
creamy
remember
when
homer
simpson
made
his
deal
with
the
devil
the
first
of
his
3
wishes
were
chocolate
beer
well
this
is
it
the
smell
was
average
other
than
that
this
beer
gets
my
highest
compliment
magic
in
a
glass
pours
a
very
nice
black
w
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
that
long
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavors
suggest
a
light
fudge
creaminess
that
balances
the
sweetness
out
with
nice
bitter
chocolate
notes
in
the
finish
overall
a
excellent
brew
77
when
held
up
to
light
this
brew
is
as
dark
as
a
stout
can
be
without
being
pitch
black
its
actually
very
clear
with
no
haze
and
exhibits
a
very
deep
garnet
hue
beautiful
creamy
light
brown
head
with
excellent
retention
sweet
real
milk
chocolate
aroma
is
nicely
combined
with
a
chocolate
malt
note
the
youngs
signature
yeast
pearish
fruitiness
of
course
adds
to
the
complexity
as
well
medium
to
full
body
that
is
almost
oily
although
the
aroma
may
suggest
that
cocoa
may
dominate
the
flavor
profile
the
combination
of
real
chocolate
chocolate
malt
roasted
barley
dryness
and
hop
bitterness
meld
well
this
is
a
flavorful
stout
and
is
highly
drinkable
like
most
of
youngs
brews
i
do
feel
however
that
this
brew
has
been
dumbened
down
in
the
last
couple
years
it
could
be
my
imagination
or
changing
palette
in
any
case
get
it
in
the
bottle
the
nitro
co2
widget
in
the
can
kills
the
taste
on
tap
amazing
unbelievably
creamy
and
smooth
delectable
and
tempting
like
candy
a
sweet
crisp
milky
and
wonderfully
balanced
brew
alcoholic
kick
nestled
comfortably
within
the
chocolate
dense
head
thick
lustrous
body
like
the
best
the
uk
has
to
offer
i
got
some
surprisingly
fruity
sensations
that
i
couldnt
quite
identify
but
loved
anyway
some
beers
just
make
you
shake
your
head
and
say
wow
this
was
one
of
those
for
me
i
later
tried
the
takehome
versions
the
bottles
good
but
the
can
is
a
disppointment
black
opaque
color
malty
aroma
soft
semisweet
chocolate
taste
malty
aftertaste
full
bodied
satisfying
and
smooth
but
not
great
i
agree
with
the
other
reviews
that
it
was
like
a
tasty
chocolate
milkshake
mmmm
gormet
chocolates
and
a
bit
of
roasted
nut
malty
smooth
burnt
cocoa
flavors
balanced
with
alchohalic
notes
very
filling
youngs
best
stout
in
my
humble
opinion
great
tan
head
and
almost
black
color
roasty
chocolatey
smells
and
flavors
with
only
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
smooth
and
luxurious
indeed
this
is
a
crazy
yummy
beer
so
damn
chocolatey
rich
creamy
and
smooth
the
complexities
are
making
me
drool
and
on
top
of
that
its
an
outstanding
stout
a
perfect
pairing
with
any
dessert
chocolate
or
on
its
own
now
available
in
cans
make
no
mistake
it
is
not
the
chocolate
barley
malt
giving
it
that
flavor
they
throw
in
chocolate
bars
in
the
boil
and
add
essence
after
filtering
it
is
a
tasty
specialty
brew
this
is
a
smooooove
stout
chocolate
malt
gives
this
beer
the
taste
of
a
dessert
that
you
can
begin
the
night
with
or
end
the
night
with
smell
strongly
of
caramel
with
a
chocolate
malt
finish
medium
body
a
delight
cant
wait
to
try
the
youngs
oatmeal
stout
i
revise
my
opinion
which
was
given
under
anonymous
previously
this
is
the
second
best
stout
giving
way
only
to
the
incredibly
smooth
delicious
oatmeal
stout
from
none
other
than
youngs
very
pleasing
to
look
at
as
well
as
drink
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lace
on
my
youngs
glass
these
two
beers
have
made
me
love
winter
time
love
it
on
a
cold
winters
night
after
dinner
with
chocolate
peanut
clusters
very
rich
almost
like
a
milkshake
best
as
an
afterdinner
drink
notes
hands
down
and
incredible
stout
and
deadly
in
its
drinkability
unfortunately
a
bottle
goes
for
about
33
50
making
it
a
brew
for
special
occasions
o
flavor
isnt
very
complex
aroma
is
the
best
part
o
pretty
nice
chocolate
flavor
particularly
in
the
scent
which
gets
a
little
overtaken
by
the
roastiness
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
wish
it
was
a
little
more
harmonized
there
but
a
solid
stout
overall
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
colored
head
that
was
pretty
thin
the
smell
was
great
with
chocolate
being
the
center
star
and
then
the
earthy
scent
of
truffle
started
to
come
through
the
taste
was
heavy
with
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
came
through
strong
in
the
start
and
then
the
earthy
spices
making
for
a
mellow
finish
very
good
but
a
little
filling
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
strong
chocolate
aftertaste
not
bad
thanks
mma
love
the
new

super
good
great

flavor
hotmilk
chocolate
is
the
dominant
aroma
roasted
malts
a
little
smokeyburnt
chocolate
ruffled
that
is
present
but
not
overpowering
finishes
with
a
light
body
medium
to
light
carbonation
and
maybe
a
light
hop
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
hooker
line
but
this
one
was
tasty
and
i
would
buy
it
again

at

notch
the
bittersweet
elements
of
the
chocolate
used
are
fantastic
with
the
sweetness
of
the
stout
big
fan
carbs

o
a
very
good
chocolate
stout
the
inclusion
of
munsons
cocoa
adds
a
nice
touch
to
an
otherwise
decent
stout
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
121013
pours
near
completely
black
with
a
half
of
inch
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
some
webs
of
lace
smell
is
bakers
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
biscuit
and
caramel
taste
is
all
of
that
but
chocolate
dominates
and
isnt
that
aggressive
still
a
nice
milf
flavor
body
is
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
nice
amount
of
life
mildly
dry
and
extremely
drinkable
this
far
from
earth
shattering
but
it
is
a
pleasant
almost
session
able
stout
dark
brown
and
clear
with
faint
edges
and
a
fine
tan
cap
thin
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
left
some
spots
on
the
glass
roasty
aroma
coffee
and
cocoa
kind
of
like
chocolate
cake
sweet
lactose
up
front
cocoa
and
semisweet
chocolate
slight
hop
character
with
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
mostly
in
the
finish
medium
plus
body
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
a
bit
dry
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
decent
texture
pretty
good
but
it
didnt
feel
completely
melded
together
id
hesitate
to
let
it
sit
though
for
fear
of
losing
some
of
the
rich
character
bottled
in
nov
2012
and
opened
in
sept
2013
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
very
small
brown
head
the
initial
smell
was
nice
dark
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
but
as
it
warmed
up
i
started
to
notice
a
little
sourness
the
sourness
definitely
came
through
in
the
taste
also
i
think
i
must
have
gotten
a
slightly
infected
bottle
unfortunately
it
seems
like
it
would
have
been
a
pretty
nice
stout
otherwise
i
didnt
really
notice
any
chocolate
but
that
could
have
been
related
to
the
infection
i
look
forward
to
rereviewing
this
beer
if
i
find
a
good
bottle
pretty
ho
hum
i
dont
like
the
tiny
metallic
flavor
not
out
right
bad
just
average
and
nothing
i
would
recommend
this
tasting
experience
started
out
terrific
but
ended
as
a
downer
overall
there
are
good
notes
in
here
but
they
seem
to
clash
with
each
other
as
if
too
much
is
going
on
the
beer
is
also
slightly
watery
in
mouthfeel
and
the
flavors
weaker
than
they
could
be
especially
those
of
the
underlying
stout
both
of
which
contribute
to
the
colalike
overtone
cheers
finally
a
beer
that
i
can
smell
cocoa
obviously
and
burnt
toast
on
the
nose
a
slight
bittersweetness
on
the
fore
with
hints
of
orange
or
lemonpeel
a
great
silkysmooth
moutfeel
that
really
coats
your
mouth
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
chocolate
or
cocoa
rather
doesnt
really
come
in
until
the
very
end
of
the
finish
its
truly
a
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
only
a
few
full
seconds
after
you
swallow
overall
a
tasty
enough
good
not
great
effort
glad
i
tried
might
pick
up
again
might
not
flavorful
sweeter
stout
with
more
dark
chocolate
and
a
moderatly
dry
dusty
hop
finish
chocolate
lingering
on
the
palate
well
done
and
well
worth
a
try
i
have
recommended
this
one
to
others
and
think
you
should
try
it
to
as
it
is
a
winner
as
a
stout
in
my
book
poured
a
dark
brown
color
deep
and
nearly
opaque
with
a
thin
cap
of
tan
head
aroma
was
pretty
chocolaty
lesser
notes
of
caramel
and
cream
taste
was
similar
sweet
chocolate
caramel
creme
candies
cappuccino
overall
a
pretty
sweet
beer
with
a
touch
of
roast
in
the
finish
where
this
one
suffered
was
in
the
mouthfeel
it
was
nice
and
tasty
but
quite
thin
in
body
definitely
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
the
beer
was
served
somewhat
chilled
and
i
actually
think
that
was
a
good
idea
i
liked
it
overall
this
is
a
sweeter
stout
but
theres
an
element
of
sourness
i
hadnt
expected
im
noting
a
bit
of
dry
raspberry
as
well
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
semisweet
cocoa
finish
so
far
my
1
chocolate
beer
very
enjoyable
and
makes
for
an
excellent
dessert
beer
alkaseltzer
touch
that
leads
to
a
slightly
grassy
bite
and
cherry
sweetness
the
grass
bite
carries
an
herbal
hop
sort
of
quality
that
i
like
very
much
its
nearly
full
bodied
yet
has
a
low
carbonation
somewhat
aqueous
feel
its
all
good
with
this
flavorful
brew
love
the
after
taste
it
was
a
chocolate
lovers
heaven
my
only
criticism
is
that
since
i
do
a
lot
of
cooking
i
could
not
detect
any
truffle
in
this
brew
truffles
have
a
distinct
odor
and
taste
but
i
did
not
get
any
of
that
here
it
is
a
nice
beer
better
than
most
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
it
could
have
more
body
but
it
is
pleasant
the
actually
chocolate
flavor
is
impressive
as
so
often
there
is
a
hint
of
cocoa
flavor
or
a
light
chocolate
scent
at
most
i
recommend
this
highly
in
terms
of
alcohol
this
was
one
of
the
lightest
stouts
that
ive
had
but
theres
just
enough
here
to
make
its
presence
felt
it
was
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
but
still
dark
enough
to
be
a
stout
without
being
full
of
booze
licorice
or
lactose
it
wasnt
enough
to
warm
me
up
tonight
but
certainly
put
a
smile
on
my
face
as
i
kicked
back
and
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
subtly
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
nice
stout
the
munsons
chocolate
adds
a
nice
feature
to
this
stout
odwould
have
liked
this
a
lot
better
via
a
beer
flight
than
a
whole
pint
it
was
just
too
concentrated
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
a
hit
with
someone
who
craved
such
a
chocolatey
brew
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
up
front
some
milk
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
little
caramel
fill
in
peaty
and
even
a
bit
smoky
flinty
especially
toward
the
finish
light
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
into
the
finish
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
bean
linger
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
nicely
done
o
this
is
a
novelty
sort
of
beer
i
like
munsons
chocolates
and
some
of
the
thomas
hooker
beers
but
this
is
not
their
best
showing
cheers
o
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
flavors
without
really
having
any
sweetness
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
o
certainly
the
best
offering
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
i
would
get
this
beer
again
but
it
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
beer
nice
complexity
of
different
chocolates
in
the
taste
and
smell
overall
it
would
be
really
nice
if
not
for
the
burnt
acrid
roasted
flavor
nice
chocolate
creamy
drinkable
nice
malts
other
than
the
acrid
roast
o
overall
a
perfect
chocolate
stout
even
if
it
is
out
of
season
compared
to
other
chocolate
beers
i
have
had
this
one
is
on
the
tops
a
great
anytime
dessert
beer
in
a
new
world
full
of
chocolate
beers
this
one
stood
out
for
me
and
i
will
certainly
be
back
for
more
o
another
chocolate
beer
its
good
but
the
field
of
chocobeers
is
filling
up
pretty
rapidly
and
i
cant
think
of
any
way
this
separate
from
the
pack
a
nice
dessert
beer
but
i
dont
see
it
catching
on
permanently
and
am
willing
to
wait
for
winter
for
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
to
get
my
chocolate
beer
fix
overall
likable
with
a
decent
balance
and
intensity
in
the
chocolate
department
i
think
a
six
pack
would
get
old
fast
but
still
worth
a
try
the
beer
poured
a
rich
chocalot
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
chocalot
malt
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
coffee
than
chocalot
which
given
the
name
disappointed
the
feel
was
light
and
a
bit
watery
a
decent
chocalot
stout
but
the
name
promised
a
bit
richer
more
chocalot
taste
than
was
delivered
another
new
brew
from
dino
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
rich
deep
brown
with
a
nice
1
5
finger
khaki
colored
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
rich
and
powerful
milk
chocolatecocoa
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
nice
more
approachable
than
expected
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
likely
the
richest
beer
ive
ever
had
the
roast
and
chocolate
blend
terrifically
with
a
gentle
sweetness
and
mild
bitterness
creamy
and
smooth
the
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
milk
chocolate
flavor
wee
carbonated
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
serious
treat
very
enjoyable
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
chocolaty
stout
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
another
reminder
of
why
ive
avoided
this
local
brewer
for
so
long
have
a
bottle
of
liberator
to
review
later
that
could
very
well
be
redemptive
but
chocolate
truffle
stout
isnt
getting
my
hopes
up
o
finally
a
stout
from
hooker
munsons
chocolate
stout
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
option
at
a
deceptive
5
9
abv
its
a
relief
to
see
them
take
on
a
style
they
were
albeit
willing
to
conform
to
their
standards
that
is
to
say
the
brewery
is
probably
not
going
to
be
launching
a
big
beer
series
anytime
soon
so
its
nice
to
see
their
offering
for
this
uniquely
americanized
style
done
well
chocolate
truffle
stout
eh
how
can
i
not
give
this
one
a
try
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
7
99
back
home
in
ct
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
taste
is
medium
bodied
smacks
you
with
chocolate
malts
upfront
nice
hoppiness
on
the
back
end
super
smooth
and
drinkable
not
too
sure
about
the
truffle
part
but
one
of
the
better
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
solid
beer
good
taste
not
at
all
hearty
for
stout
the
chocolate
is
nice
but
the
finished
product
is
just
ok
notes
surprised
that
this
one
didnt
hit
our
market
sooner
with
all
the
other
chocolate
beers
conveniently
arriving
around
valentines
day
o
not
a
style
i
ordinarily
go
in
for
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
one
does
the
trick
though
overall
like
opening
a
box
of
valentines
day
chocolates
one
of
the
better
chocolate
beers
out
there
because
the
chocolate
is
so
complex
and
rich
yet
the
beer
element
here
is
also
nice
and
complex
due
to
its
richness
i
only
want
one
or
two
per
sitting
but
would
get
this
again
one
of
the
better
beers
coming
out
of
connecticut
after
a
somewhat
aggressive
pour
this
beer
turns
out
very
dark
brown
just
a
shade
lighter
than
black
with
a
light
khaki
head
of
about
one
finger
the
foam
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
with
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
name
suggests
chocolate
is
in
the
smell
but
it
isnt
alone
as
there
is
also
a
standard
compliment
of
dark
and
roasted
malts
typical
of
a
dry
stout
but
overall
everything
is
a
bit
subdued
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
both
from
the
added
chocolate
and
chocolate
malts
along
with
a
good
deal
of
bitter
roasted
and
black
patent
malt
hop
flavor
is
nearly
non
existent
but
it
is
still
somewhat
bitter
to
astringent
due
to
the
malt
the
body
of
this
beer
is
quite
light
which
surprises
me
for
a
stout
of
this
style
id
expect
something
a
bit
fuller
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
rather
dry
as
astringent
bittering
from
the
roasted
malt
comes
through
again
id
rather
something
a
bit
sweeter
for
this
stout
overall
this
is
slightly
above
average
it
is
an
interesting
concept
but
suffers
because
the
stout
isnt
right
too
best
accentuate
the
chocolate
a
sweeter
fuller
and
more
complex
maybe
higher
alcohol
base
would
have
benefited
this
one
as
a
child
i
grew
up
eating
munsons
chocolates
during
the
holidays
i
find
it
funny
now
to
be
drinking
a
beer
made
with
chocolate
from
this
familyowned
connecticutbased
company
all
in
all
a
nicely
done
stout
hopefully
this
is
only
the
start
of
hooker
brewings
attempt
to
add
some
long
needed
diversity
to
their
current
lineup
of
beers
o
overall
a
great
stout
with
chocolate
hooker
built
a
great
flavored
beer
without
skimping
on
the
base
style
very
drinkable
i
was
surprised
how
easy
drinking
it
was
now
that
ive
tried
it
alone
i
want
to
try
it
again
pairing
it
with
various
foods
well
done
a
light
and
friendly
chocolate
stout
as
opposed
to
a
dark
an
indulgent
version
would
be
great
if
the
base
beer
was
improved
upon
overall
this
is
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
chocolate
stout
offering
whose
flavor
is
terrific
but
its
scent
and
appearance
are
nothing
special
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
20120209
sampled
on
march
6
2012
it
pours
a
very
dark
rich
chocolate
black
with
a
moderate
shortlived
mocha
head
brewed
with
seven
malts
you
get
the
chocolate
oat
and
dark
malts
right
up
front
on
the
nose
with
this
acidic
hop
bite
around
the
back
the
body
was
thin
the
medium
which
was
a
slight
letdown
the
bold
flavor
begins
with
sweet
chocolate
and
cocoa
then
goes
bitter
and
ends
nearly
dry
its
name
sounded
much
more
enticing
than
the
experience
but
it
was
still
a
decent
enough
beer
12oz
bottle
with
a
born
on
date
of
20120215
pours
a
blackish
dark
brown
with
no
head
no
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
vanilla
chocolate
truffles
and
some
coffee
tastes
chocolatey
flavors
of
vanilla
coffee
some
marshmallow
and
truffle
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
thin
for
the
style
but
it
still
works
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
isnt
so
chocolatey
it
slows
you
down
overall
an
interesting
collaboration
well
executed
worth
seeking
out
o
not
a
bad
chocolate
stout
pretty
simple
surprisingly
heavy
on
the
bitter
coffee
and
roast
given
the
name
but
the
chocolate
is
there
to
help
balance
it
out
decently
2
a
single
o
this
beer
was
great
i
am
really
into
my
coffeechocolate
stouts
so
this
was
perfect
for
me
a
nice
change
from
my
regular
sierra
nevada
stout
i
usually
get
i
had
only
had
hookers
watermelon
ale
yuckkk
but
when
i
saw
that
they
collaborated
with
the
delicious
munsons
chocolatiers
i
grabbed
a
six
pack
of
this
and
was
found
that
hooker
can
make
a
great
beer
i
ended
buying
2
more
6
packs
one
for
the
girlfriend
for
valentines
day
since
they
were
flying
off
the
shelves
if
you
like
stout
especially
chocolate
stouts
then
this
beer
is
for
you
i
hope
to
see
this
again
next
winter
pretty
good
ive
had
much
worse
chocolate
stouts
by
more
highly
acclaimed
breweries
good
job
hooker
make
this
regularly
md
the
body
is
much
thinner
than
i
expected
it
honestly
seems
more
like
a
porter
to
me
or
at
least
porters
i
have
had
it
has
a
mild
acidic
bite
a
tasty
brew
but
not
the
bomb
i
had
expected
regardless
a
delicious
wellbrewed
beer
great
brew
not
sure
if
id
want
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
definitely
something
you
should
try
if
you
like
chocolate
to
any
degree
o
i
went
in
with
high
expectations
and
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
was
a
success
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
nose
and
flavors
capture
the
awesomeness
that
is
munsons
chocolates
its
listed
as
a
spring
seasonal
on
hookers
site
so
hopefully
this
will
return
next
year
o
great
beer
which
is
slighly
sneaky
on
the
abv
pours
black
with
head
that
thins
to
less
than
a
lace
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
malts
a
little
mild
kind
of
tastes
artificially
flavored
with
chemicals
starts
smooth
then
turns
bitter
not
much
stands
out
here
and
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
a
true
session
ale
here
but
im
not
leaning
towards
buying
a
lot
more
and
sessioning
very
sweet
stout
low
alcohol
content
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
japanese
stout
easily
the
worst
milk
stout
ever
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
beer
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
but
at
almost
5
a
bottle
i
could
not
bring
my
self
to
do
that
said
in
my
angry
samurai
voice
o
decent
for
a
dry
stout
cant
endorse
it
for
a
sweet
stout
though
kiuchi
has
some
fringe
approaches
to
their
products
it
certainly
did
hold
up
alright
after
2
years
maybe
not
so
surprising
looks
ok
smells
bad
tastes
meh
worth
trying
once
while
sharing
the
bottle
among
46
people
share
the
pain
if
someone
offers
you
one
plead
lactose
intolerance
sweet
stout
has
the
black
and
visibly
bubbly
appearance
of
cocacola
as
it
fizzes
vigorously
on
the
initial
pour
and
its
head
vanishes
only
a
moment
later
for
the
aroma
i
pick
up
caramel
and
only
an
inkling
of
coffee
and
chocolate
unfortunately
theres
what
can
be
described
as
a
metallic
offscent
present
the
taste
however
is
quite
a
bit
better
it
has
a
light
milky
chocolate
flavor
similar
to
a
three
musketeers
candy
bar
but
it
comes
with
a
slightly
chalky
finish
i
dont
really
mind
how
it
is
thin
because
i
knew
that
by
the
abv
and
i
happen
to
like
sessionable
stouts
porters
overall
though
i
expected
more
from
the
kiuchi
brewery
i
am
going
to
try
their
espresso
stout
next
as
the
reviews
are
much
more
favorable
in
regards
to
this
one
reach
for
a
guinness
instead
overall
tasty
enough
and
quite
drinkable
at
less
than
4
i
might
not
put
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
for
a
dark
sessionable
beer
this
is
pretty
good
if
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
bottle
into
tulip
at
hitachino
tasting
2013
deep
black
color
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
nice
roasty
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
roasty
sweet
malt
but
somewhat
chalky
and
super
dry
its
just
way
to
dry
for
me
but
flavor
is
trying
to
make
an
appearance
just
not
quite
there
meh
tmo
it
has
a
very
lame
stout
taste
there
isnt
much
of
a
taste
there
it
is
metallic
and
a
bit
burnt
chalky
and
dry
it
is
medium
bodied
if
not
a
bit
less
it
just
tastes
low
quality
and
the
after
taste
really
is
unappealing
atmosphere
is
decent
dark
hue
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
lacing
though
nose
is
roasted
malt
with
a
really
strong
sweetness
charred
malt
with
very
little
else
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
overall
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
brew
i
didnt
really
have
high
expectations
and
those
were
definitely
not
close
to
being
met
but
ive
enjoyed
the
other
kiuchi
beers
so
i
wont
hold
this
miss
against
them
overall
the
kiuchi
brewery
makes
other
beers
that
are
much
much
better
than
this
one
unfortunately
none
of
them
are
stouts
if
that
is
what
youre
looking
for
black
very
little
bubbles
lightly
sweet
d
the
opposite
of
what
i
expected
not
at
all
like
a
milk
stout
the
sourness
with
the
roasted
grains
is
a
bad
combination
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
one
poured
into
a
lucifer
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
thin
light
brown
head
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
mild
malty
aroma
with
roast
and
biscuit
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
dry
grass
light
flavor
of
malt
slight
roasted
malt
light
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
light
bodied
light
and
attenuated
flavor
which
is
expected
from
this
light
abv
stout
a
pleasant
lightly
flavored
stout
ive
probably
moved
on
past
this
light
a
flavor
in
beer
but
this
seems
nicely
made
for
its
intent
closer
to
a
light
porter
than
a
stout
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
mild
coffee
with
some
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malts
it
smells
slightly
sweet
the
flavor
of
this
beer
follows
the
nose
the
coffee
notes
are
a
little
more
prominent
with
the
chocolate
notes
receding
into
the
background
the
malt
notes
add
to
the
slight
roastiness
of
this
beer
theres
some
slight
sweetness
here
too
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
its
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
coming
across
as
more
of
a
porter
it
seems
like
this
beer
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
its
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
if
you
dont
mind
the
price
tag
o
this
is
not
on
of
kiuchis
finest
ales
which
is
a
shame
since
im
a
fan
of
sweetmilk
stouts
and
many
of
kiuchis
other
brews
not
as
horrible
as
others
feel
it
is
just
really
tough
if
comparing
to
other
beers
just
misses
enough
in
some
areas
and
overcompensates
in
others
ive
had
much
worse
o
meh
its
not
bad
but
it
is
not
that
good
i
wasnt
expecting
a
great
stout
from
a
japanese
brewery
if
this
is
all
i
could
buy
and
drink
in
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
i
would
not
complain
though
interesting
to
try
at
least
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
cream
with
some
lactose
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
mixed
in
there
is
also
a
slight
medicinal
aroma
which
i
am
not
really
caring
for
the
flavor
is
more
straightforward
with
the
basic
characteristics
of
cream
lactose
and
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation

o
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
fuller
body
and
stronger
flavors
o
a
pretty
decent
milk
stout
good
flavors
to
it
however
there
are
a
few
of
things
like
lack
of
flavor
in
the
finish
that
hold
this
beer
back
if
youre
a
fan
of
milk
stouts
its
still
worth
a
try
onot
bad
i
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
lots
of
complaints
about
the
price
but
i
cant
go
to
japan
for
5
but
if
i
ever
do
go
i
will
probably
give
this
another
try
had
it
on
bottle
thick
dense
light
tan
head
moderate
in
duration
tops
a
coalblack
body
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
licorice
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
wet
pine
body
extremely
smooth
and
milky
with
a
light
pervading
fizzy
sourness
a
bit
like
the
faint
underlying
citrus
in
a
cola
and
a
moderately
sweet
chalky
cocoa
texture
overlaying
it
touches
of
anise
and
cherry
relatively
dry
smooth
and
quick
finish
overall
this
was
an
alright
beer
it
was
an
interesting
go
at
something
i
had
never
tried
before
but
i
found
a
lack
of
synergy
between
two
not
so
great
tastes
overall
i
realize
people
do
not
like
this
beer
but
i
wonder
if
they
base
that
on
the
price
its
5
per
bottle
but
it
isnt
that
bad
its
very
drinkable
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
milkchocolate
bar
i
like
it
its
a
good
beer
thats
about
it
not
worth
5
drinkability
i
like
this
stuff
true
to
style
it
is
not
going
to
be
sinister
so
i
think
it
does
its
job
it
is
very
smooth
offers
a
nice
though
subdued
flavor
experience
and
is
on
the
light
side
in
terms
of
abv
it
is
not
however
worth

a
bottle
thin
body
does
little
to
deter
one
from
drinking
this
rather
quickly
nor
does
the
low
level
of
carbonation
theres
a
bit
of
fizziness
early
on
that
provides
a
bit
of
a
tingle
but
it
disappears
rather
quickly
it
doesnt
take
long
to
drain
the
24oz
bottle
but
its
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
o
not
a
beer
that
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
a
little
more
flavor
and
some
body
would
do
this
beer
some
good
date

overall
in
one
word
drainpour
the
only
thing
worse
than
the
thought
of
having
paid
5
50
for
this
bottle
was
the
thought
of
actually
finishing
the
whole
thing
i
dont
dole
out
fs
very
often
but
this
is
regrettably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
its
way
off
the
reservation
stylewise
and
cant
possibly
be
what
the
brewer
envisioned
avoid
its
not
bad
but
its
very
very
unexciting
a
stout
questionable
it
has
the
lightness
and
easy
drinking
of
any
generic
beer
you
choose
to
name
pretty
boring
o
an
enjoyable
and
modestly
distinctive
stout
that
is
neither
heavy
nor
sweet

served
in
a

the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
milk
chocolate
roasted

coffee
and
a
bit
of
soy

the
brew
tastes
like
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
lactose
and
some
coffee
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
theres
nothing
impressive
about
this
one
either
o
up
front
this
beer
lacks
taste
but
i
love
the
iced
coffee
finish
very
drinkable
stout
and
is
very
versatile
even
good
in
warm
weather
i
didnt
find
the
aroma
to
be
very
strong
and
got
almost
no
head
from
the
pour
at
all
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
again
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
other
stouts
i
would
rather
have
very
unremarkable
d
overall
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
great
either
aftertaste
grows
to
be
a
little
weird
well
after
drinking
in
fact
the
lactose
i
think
hampers
the
full
flavor
character
that
rests
in
this
recipe
not
the
best
offering
from
this
brewer
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
from
the
score
for
this
one
theres
something
very
off
about
the
aroma
its
tart
acidic
and
funky
theres
light
roasted
notes
and
some
sweetness
but
its
drowned
out
by
the
former
it
doesnt
look
bad
though
very
dark
brown
with
lighter
tinges
on
the
edges
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
fast
and
leaves
nothing
the
funk
doesnt
really
show
itself
much
at
all
on
the
taste
light
roasted
notes
a
bit
of
milky
sweetness
and
possibly
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
feel
is
creamy
but
jeeze
is
it
thin
theres
just
not
much
substance
to
it
overall
its
a
mess
and
im
glad
i
only
paid
a
dollar
for
it
on
clearance
tastes
of
sour
milk
soggy
french
fries
paper
weeds
white
chocolate
hops
and
albion
sugar
wanted
something
a
bit
more
compact
i
dont
know
but
the
flavors
in
this
didnt
really
work
all
that
well
together
nah
not
really
buy
this
again
once
was
enough

a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
o
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
i
wont
be
getting
more
this
pours
out
as
traditional
black
colored
brew
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
it
that
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
a
little
funky
but
had
some
decent
smokey
roasted
aromas
going
on
in
there
the
taste
of
this
was
sweet
and
roasted
upfront
that
went
into
a
subtle
nuttiness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
could
have
been
creamier
this
was
an
average
stout
at
best
o
the
tart
sour
nature
takes
away
from
the
milk
stout
qualities
i
was
hoping
for
somewhat
disappointed
relative
to
other
hitachinos
ive
tried
330ml
bottle
from
buffalo
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tightly
packed
head
nose
is
a
weird
dark
fruit
sweet
smoke
combo
more
smoke
in
the
flavor
with
a
slight
sweetness
smoke
charred
wood
slight
infectiontype
flavor
notes
worst
part
is
the
carbonation
way
too
high
bites
in
the
mouth
even
after
trying
to
swirl
it
out
could
be
quite
flavorful
for
the
abv
but
there
are
some
major
flaws
here
havent
had
a
beer
this
bad
in
a
while
o
very
strange
brew
i
dont
think
i
like
it
o
a
tasty
offering
but
by
far
the
weakest
of
the
hitachino
flagship
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
date
by
no
means
terrible
but
just
not
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
their
beers
d
certainly
sessionable
at
just
under
4
abv
and
although
theres
enough
flavor
squeezed
out
of
such
little
malt
relative
to
abv
this
stout
is
minimalist
to
the
point
of
exclusion
in
taste
a
pretty
tame
offering
and
id
move
on
after
one
but
some
may
fall
for
the
charm
of
this
sweet
light
stout
o
not
bad
not
overwhelmingly
amazing
for
the
price
of
these
beers
i
wont
buy
again
wish
i
knew
what
this
odd
spice
is
from
overall
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
is
certainly
for
some
people
but
by
no
means
is
it
for
everyone
i
hate
to
review
it
so
low
because
i
actually
kind
of
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
masochistic
way
odd
o
looked
pretty
good
but
failed
to
deliver
on
anything
else
carbonation
is
too
high
no
need
to
try
again
more
soda
pop
character
than
beer
little
to
define
it
as
stout
other
than
perhaps
the
color
which
is
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
at
first
whiff
i
was
expecting
the
worst
however
the
sourness
presumably
from
the
lactose
settles
down
for
the
most
part
whats
left
is
indeed
sweet
and
milky
but
without
a
whole
lot
else
in
term
of
actual
flavour
not
worth
seeking
out
im
not
sure
ill
finish
this
bottle
and
im
certainly
not
tempted
to
buy
another
so
i
cant
give
it
anything
above
awful
in
the
drinkability
category
d
can
be
drank
but
just
not
enjoyable
flavors
are
there
just
not
as
potent
as
they
could
or
should
be
beer
is
way
too
thin
almost
no
flavor
the
primary
flavor
is
ashy
and
dirty
there
is
a
minimal
sweetness
up
front
but
i
really
dislike
this
beer
this
is
okay
as
a
beer
but
not
all
that
exciting
theres
also
a
slightly
odd
note
to
it
that
i
dont
really
like
d
its
to
bad
i
got
3
more
of
these
i
wont
be
drinking
them
would
not
drink
again
unless
my
throat
was
on
fire
d
pass
this
brew
pours
a
dark
as
night
cola
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
mocha
laced
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissapears
to
leave
a
layer
of
froth
across
the
topthe
smell
is
a
mix
of
aromas
of
milky
coffee
and
roasted
maltsit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
which
should
be
definately
thicker
in
my
eyes
and
exudes
tastes
of
dark
milky
coffeeroasted
malts
and
finishes
with
a
slight
tiny
tinge
of
bitterness
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
expectinghopingoverall
its
definately
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
it
does
have
certain
let
downs
in
my
eyes
the
first
being
its
very
low
abv
and
the
second
is
its
very
light
mouthfeel
and
i
think
if
these
2
things
were
sorted
out
it
could
be
right
up
there
the
lactose
just
turns
me
off
and
kind
of
grosses
me
out
ive
brewed
with
lactose
and
know
that
when
used
properly
it
can
add
a
nice
extra
element
to
a
stout
but
it
is
simply
too
overwhelming
in
this
beer
even
without
it
i
would
barely
recognize
this
as
a
stout
for
the
lack
of
any
roasted
malt
drinkability
was
missing
it
was
so
sour
that
i
could
only
take
a
small
sip
every
minute
or
two
overall
not
what
i
expected
from
a
sweet
stout
offputting
sweetness
plagues
this
one
from
aroma
to
taste
to
finish
glad
i
only
got
one
as
i
would
not
want
another
when
compared
to
memory
with
other
breakfastmilksweet
stouts
i
have
had
i
do
not
think
this
is
any
worse
than
other
labels
but
at
about
5
us
where
i
buy
well
i
could
get
similar
for
not
as
expensive
price
4
99
at
whole
foods
d
while
this
beer
has
its
good
points
mainly
its
a
disappointment
kiuchi
is
capable
of
much
better
not
that
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
confused
and
confusing
beer
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
given
the
price
i
would
never
buy
it
again
d
if
it
weren
for
thewildly
inconsistant
nature
of
this
brewer
i
would
saw
they
are
great
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
aroma
but
what
it
does
have
is
slightly
sour
and
stouty
the
taste
is
similar
with
dark
coffee
flavors
and
a
sour
aftertaste
being
mildly
lactoseintolerant
i
poured
most
of
this
beer
out
thinking
it
wasnt
worth
the
possibility
of
a
stomache
ache
pours
black
into
a
pint
glass
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
smells
really
funky
lots
of
sourness
thats
about
it
for
the
nose
taste
is
sour
as
well
with
some
dry
cocoa
in
the
finish
the
cocoa
is
the
only
redeeming
quality
in
my
opinion
body
is
average
at
best
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
funky
yet
boring
stout
i
have
no
desire
to
ever
drink
this
again
funky
little
beer
with
a
low
abv
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
nice
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
notes
with
the
slightly
sweet
finish
which
is
true
to
the
style
i
like
the
sourish
finish
as
it
works
with
the
sweetness
interesting
beer
as
it
is
a
style
you
dont
often
see
around
drinkability
i
am
not
a
fan
and
will
pass
on
in
the
future
the
sourness
is
a
bit
too
overbearing
for
the
style
when
you
mix
that
with
the
background
sugar
sweetness
the
beer
does
not
work
way
different
for
the
stylenot
bad
if
you
want
just
to
try
a
sour
beer
yawner
especially
for
this
beer
style
poured
with
a
short
but
enduring
tan
head
and
good
lace
aroma
is
mild
of
malt
roastiness
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
about
the
same
but
with
some
tartness
and
funkyness
body
is
thin
and
ok
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favs
cant
see
it
as
a
session
i
have
to
say
i
actually
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
it
pour
a
very
dark
black
in
color
with
little
to
no
carbonation
and
a
slight
white
head
its
smelled
of
roasted
malts
and
espresso
nice
yet
not
overwhelming
nose
i
actually
very
much
enjoyed
the
flavor
to
this
stout
nice
sweetness
and
malt
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
very
well
balanced
and
not
off
putting
in
anyway
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
soft
and
smooth
overall
drink
ability
on
this
was
actually
great
and
i
liked
this
as
a
really
nice
session
stout
if
money
was
no
option
its
only
at
4
percent
alcohol
and
the
flavor
does
not
seem
to
suffer
much
from
this
at
all
overall
this
was
more
then
i
would
have
been
expecting
from
a
japanese
stout
this
is
one
i
would
seek
out
again
and
think
would
go
great
with
a
good
meal
or
to
drink
as
something
that
wont
get
you
bombed
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
out
when
you
would
still
have
to
drive
later
and
dont
want
to
be
getting
a
dui
with
out
sacrificing
flavor
in
the
process
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
nose
was
dank
with
notes
of
molasses
prunes
and
dark
chocolate
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
only
cola
highlights
at
the
edges
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slightly
sour
dark
chocolate
flavor
finish
was
slightly
bitter
like
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
for
a
milksweet
stout
this
was
pretty
sour
oof
pours
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
light
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
as
well
as
chocolaty
and
a
little
sweet
flavor
is
more
like
an
ale
than
a
stout
mainly
malty
with
a
chocolaty
undertone
and
nutty
and
coffee
hints
tasty
nonetheless
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
dang
i
really
like
for
a
stout
to
taste
like
a
stout
wow
i
started
this
review
expecting
to
tear
apart
this
beer
but
it
is
very
good
and
well
worth
trying
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
has
changed
as
i
dont
remember
this
beer
tasting
anything
like
this
even
if
you
tried
this
beer
before
try
a
fresher
batch
of
it
and
see
if
it
is
different
than
you
remember
very
good
and
tasty
stout
and
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
almost
exclusively
drinks
imperial
stouts
not
bad
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
seem
right
its
also
somewhat
thin
as
well
worth
a
try
regardless
drinkability
i
personally
like
milk
stouts
but
this
is
a
milk
stout
i
wouldnt
have
again
id
rather
have
a
mackeson
or
a
lancasters
milk
stout
notes
might
wear
on
you
over
the
course
of
a
night
the
light
carbonation
could
be
improved
but
this
beer
still
aint
bad
d
interesting
and
worth
remembering
still
its
far
enough
off
the
beaten
path
to
remain
a
specialty
beer
especially
at
its
price
there
are
occasions
where
itll
be
the
perfect
choice
but
they
are
rare
until
then
there
are
better
deals
if
i
just
want
a
normal
milk
stout
boy
this
was
a
big
disappointment
i
like
some
of
what
kiuchi
does
but
this
beer
is
a
onenote
wonder
pours
dark
ruby
with
an
effervescent
head
that
foreshadows
the
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
the
lactose
sweetness
definitely
comes
through
but
it
has
amost
no
roasted
malt
backbone
to
provide
balance
without
any
roasted
bitterness
or
coffee
qualities
the
lactose
dominates
with
an
unpleasant
soy
metallic
quality
there
just
isnt
enough
here
to
make
this
worth
your
while
interesting
beer
weird
but
interesting
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
has
the
benefit
of
not
being
overly
potent
which
helps
make
it
tolerable
to
have
more
than
one
but
the
taste
and
smell
make
it
seem
like
something
i
would
only
have
once
d
high
drinkability
due
to
good
ratings
on
the
above
low
alcohol
makes
this
almost
a
session
beer
slightly
odd
taste
brings
down
overall
drinkability
d
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
a
very
good
tasting
example
of
the
style
it
makes
something
of
a
comeback
as
it
progresses
but
has
a
sour
undertow
that
doesnt
help
mfd
i
think
i
may
have
finally
found
a
beer
with
a
more
unapealing
consistency
than
guinness
draught
but
seriously
this
beer
could
man
up
and
get
some
body
to
match
its
midnight
black
color
i
would
certainly
not
want
another
one
of
these
beers
mouthfeel
is
decent
creamy
and
smooth
but
somewhat
light
especially
for
a
stout
i
personally
like
sour
ales
funky
brews
but
this
just
missed
its
mark
in
my
opinion
it
was
just
too
much
or
maybe
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
either
way
i
didnt
enjoy
this
very
much
i
guess
its
worth
a
shot
as
it
is
a
pretty
original
and
interesting
brew
however
ah
well
you
cant
win
em
all
at
least
i
can
say
i
tried
it
hitachino
nest
has
always
been
a
homerun
hitter
in
my
book
until
this
one
it
does
nothing
for
me
watery
and
sour
are
two
descriptors
i
dont
enjoy
in
a
milk
stout
not
good
im
amazed
this
is
by
the
same
brewery
responsible
for
the
completely
wonderful
celebration
ale
ill
keep
trying
hitachino
stuffso
far
theyve
got
one
truly
great
beer
one
soso
beer
red
rice
ale
and
this
thing
pours
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
massive
three
finger
creamed
coffee
head
with
good
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
awfully
thick
on
the
pour
like
spent
motor
oil
aroma
of
roasted
malts
some
burnt
caramel
and
hints
of
sweet
lactic
acid
flavor
is
a
bit
watered
down
and
the
slightest
hint
of
sourness
chocolate
flavors
permeate
the
brew
some
nice
roastiness
and
a
biting
bitterness
on
the
finish
some
sweet
cola
flavors
appear
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
seems
kind
of
thin
considering
the
look
upon
the
pour
carbonation
is
light
and
it
goes
down
awfully
smooth
not
a
bad
brew
but
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
drinkablity
different
interpretation
of
the
style
but
very
drinkable
and
intense
kind
of
a
weird
one
and
not
my
favorite
hitachino
offering
but
far
from
bad
the
lactose
or
something
gave
it
a
strange
but
for
some
reason
pleasing
soured
milk
scent
and
taste
a
bit
of
smoke
and
tobacco
in
there
as
well
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
guiness
in
the
can
with
a
spoiled
milk
funk
i
know
that
sounds
terrible
but
it
wasnt
half
bad
ill
stick
to
the
classic
espresso
white
and
ginger
oh
yeah
and
celebration
and
xh
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
one
just
lacks
a
bit
a
strange
beer
i
would
have
it
again
just
to
compare
to
my
first
one
but
overall
it
was
a
little
confusing
and
my
least
favourite
of
the
hitachino
lineup
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
just
slightly
above
average
for
the
price
id
rather
find
something
with
a
little
bit
more
flavor
and
classic
stout
characteristics
that
said
its
worth
at
least
one
try
d
a
tad
sweet
but
good
drinkability
and
unique
at
only
4
abv
it
comes
off
sweet
with
lots
of
flavor
but
is
limited
in
multiples
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
is
a
mess
too
much
lactose
tobacco
flavor
and
twang
avoid
this
drinks
good
a
nice
sweet
stout
a
bit
pricey
paid
about
5
50
for
12
ounces
milk
chocolate
is
apparent
on
the
palate
but
not
as
strong
as
the
nose
also
tastes
of
some
sort
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
sourness
d
ill
pass
on
this
one
d
easy
drinker
i
definitely
could
have
more
than
one
thankfully
it
is
low
in
alcohol
so
that
wont
be
a
problem
maybe
i
should
have
listened
to
the
reviews
on
this
one
well
it
looked
ok
very
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
worth
of
light
brown
head
but
smelled
a
little
weird
kind
of
like
green
olives
had
a
watered
down
light
feel
to
in
the
mouth
and
tasted
a
little
sour
with
a
very
small
amount
of
dark
malts
showing
thru
quite
a
strange
smelling
and
tasting
beer
i
drank
the
entire
bottle
and
have
never
poured
out
a
beer
before
but
this
one
is
closest
i
have
come
to
doing
such
a
horrible
thing
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
and
will
never
try
it
again
however
i
would
not
dismiss
this
brewery
because
i
absolutely
love
their
white
ale
simply
fantastic
meh
interesting
but
i
pass
too
bittersour
for
the
style
at
least
its
something
different
this
little
bad
boy
has
been
sitting
in
my
beer
cellar
for
about
3
years
now
and
i
dug
it
out
tonight
served
at
cellar
temp
in
a
stemmed
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
decent
size
head
that
faded
quickly
though
there
was
a
colalike
fizziness
to
the
carbonation
the
taste
was
pretty
good
but
not
spectacular
had
some
decent
aspects
of
coffee
and
chocolate
to
it
very
thin
body
though
which
was
a
negative
this
is
the
2nd
milk
stout
ive
had
and
this
one
was
surprisingly
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
more
roasted
flavor
than
sweetness
a
slightly
subpar
stout
in
comparison
to
others
out
there
but
a
decent
introduction
to
a
japanese
craft
brewer
copped
a
single
short
fat
stout
bottle
from
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
wasnt
expecting
such
a
weak
3

abv
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
impressive
appearance
which
pours
a
jetblack
ebony
hue
with
an
impressive
foamy
and
frothy
head
that
boasted
some
staying
power
aroma
was
about
average
some
slight
chocolate
and
malt
flavors
but
not
too
dominant
or
overwhelming
flavor
was
somewhat
bland
and
watery
with
obvious
mocha
and
espresso
flavors
apparaent
but
were
overshadowed
by
a
weak
and
unimpressive
watery
aftertaste
certainly
my
least
favorite
brew
from
kiuchi
that
ive
sampled
thus
far
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
pass
it
up
hitachino
makes
much
better
beers
than
this
one
poured
a
21oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
2
pours
poured
a
hazy
opaque
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
that
had
been
left
in
the
sun
for
about
an
hour
to
long
taste
is
very
weak
there
was
a
faint
sweetness
no
creaminess
and
a
strange
tartness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
there
was
a
strange
amount
of
carbonation
i
try
no
to
let
one
beer
set
my
impressions
of
a
brewery
but
it
will
be
hard
to
get
it
out
of
my
mind
upon
opening
the
bottle
dark
chocolate
caramelized
malty
goodness
and
a
slight
citrus
aroma
fill
the
air
as
i
pour
it
into
a
giant
goblet
the
head
grows
and
grows
there
is
highly
active
carbonation
and
now
i
smell
a
bit
of
berry
although
there
is
a
definite
creaminess
the
carbonation
makes
this
beer
taste
lighter
than
it
is
the
head
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
last
well
past
my
drinking
pour
was
great
in
color
and
head
flavor
was
shallow
sweetness
was
hardly
there
at
all
and
mouthfeel
was
really
thin
i
also
didnt
think
the
somewhat
tart
note
in
the
backround
was
appropriate
a
sweet
stout
need
not
be
chewy
to
be
good
but
this
was
too
watery
it
was
worth
a
try
but
ill
not
be
going
back
for
more
im
glad
this
wasnt
the
only
beer
i
bought
today
feels
thin
and
inconsistent
hops
tries
to
give
a
bite
at
the
end
but
doesnt
perhaps
a
sourmilk
porter
is
a
better
description
drain
pour
but
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
version
this
brew
poured
thick
and
almost
flat
out
of
the
bottle
with
no
head
to
speak
of
aromas
were
of
sweet
roasted
malts
some
nuttiness
too
taste
was
on
the
verge
of
too
sweet
sucralose
sugars
somwhat
artificial
with
no
bitterness
to
balance
this
is
just
too
sweet
there
is
a
slick
oilyness
to
the
mouthfeel
is
there
dairy
creamer
is
this
well
whatever
the
case
it
is
somewhat
disturbing
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
coconuts
and
more
sweetness
not
a
balanced
brew
i
could
hardly
finish
the
small
bottle
d
id
drink
this
again
if
it
were
free
the
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
fruit
bouquet
then
herbal
hop
ushers
in
phenols
there
is
a
sourness
i
find
offputting
and
tobacco
in
the
finish
good
if
you
dont
think
of
it
as
stout
awesome
with
lamb
this
stuff
is
definately
different
mouthfeel
gets
points
off
for
stinging
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
sandy
colored
head
that
faded
quickly
to
just
the
beer
looked
like
a
glass
of
prune
juice
aromas
of
burnt
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
same
with
a
sour
acidicness
that
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
a
unusual
tasting
beer
i
asume
from
the
lactose
moutfeel
light
and
carbonation
light
not
a
very
well
put
together
beer
not
one
i
would
recommend
or
buy
again
poured
out
of
a
big
bottle
into
the
glass
a
solid
black
body
that
appears
rather
thinnish
head
is
tan
and
tall
smell
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
lactic
acid
lemon
juice
and
some
funk
the
chocolate
is
surely
present
in
the
taste
but
the
roastiness
mellows
it
out
lots
of
acid
on
the
tongue
with
lemon
juice
flavors
and
lactic
acid
i
pick
up
some
tobacco
in
the
flavor
somewhere
finishes
dry
with
more
roasted
grain
and
some
black
berry
that
sticks
in
my
mind
on
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
light
and
lively
ok
this
is
an
extremely
refreshing
interesting
and
delicious
stout
that
i
could
see
being
a
good
summer
session
stout
especially
since
its
less
than
4
abv
after
i
posted
this
review
and
got
closer
to
finishing
the
beer
i
noticed
quite
a
lot
of
rather
large
particles
of
debris
in
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
hitachino
nest
sweet
stout
has
more
in
common
with
dark
belgians
such
as
vondel
troubadour
obscura
and
de
dolle
export
stout
however
its
balance
and
drinkability
fall
below
these
examples
its
unique
as
others
have
said
but
not
especially
palatable
worth
a
try
if
youre
comparing
oddball
stouts
im
sampling
a
cellar
temp
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
and
allows
no
light
passage
a
small
fizzy
tan
head
foams
up
for
a
second
and
leaves
quickly
leaving
no
evidence
aroma
is
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
but
is
dominated
by
a
tangy
funkiness
first
sip
reveals
a
silky
smooth
texture
and
very
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
starts
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
allows
some
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
and
also
a
bit
of
lactic
funkiness
as
well
the
finish
is
tangy
funk
and
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
normal
or
if
the
beer
is
just
a
hint
past
prime
the
other
beer
flavors
are
enjoyable
and
are
still
easily
discerned
and
i
have
heard
that
hitachino
brews
tend
to
be
funky
this
isnt
really
similar
to
most
sweet
stouts
i
have
had
and
im
not
sure
i
like
it
but
i
know
i
dont
hate
it
i
would
categorize
this
beer
as
a
sweet
stout
or
a
milk
stout
there
is
not
a
lot
of
roastiness
to
it
but
there
is
a
pleasing
sweet
milk
sugar
lactose
flavor
to
it
upfront
like
a
number
of
hitachino
beers
i
got
some
cedar
notes
like
being
in
a
humidor
i
thought
this
beer
was
highly
drinkable
for
a
sweet
stout
even
more
drinkable
than
a
number
of
dry
stouts
like
guinness
color
was
dark
but
not
inky
black
like
some
other
stouts
aroma
was
a
bit
like
condensed
milk
i
would
recommend
this
stout
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
the
next
time
youre
at
your
local
sushi
bar
or
japanese
restaurant
drinkability
as
i
said
earlier
interesting
but
not
sure
i
like
it
not
much
roasted
barley
presence
and
not
as
creamy
of
a
mouthfeel
as
i
look
for
in
a
milk
stout
not
terrible
but
probably
a
one
time
thing
for
me
whimsical
bottle
whimsical
beer
not
so
much
appropriately
stouty
in
appearanceclear
but
very
dark
with
rusty
brown
tinges
around
the
edges
topped
off
with
a
modest
cap
of
fine
brown
head
that
quickly
fell
away
to
a
tight
ring
a
more
assertive
nose
than
anticipatedeven
when
still
well
chilledhighlighted
by
a
tasty
chococoffee
roastiness
those
notes
carry
over
less
to
the
taste
which
is
characterized
by
a
lasting
creamy
sweetness
and
complemented
by
an
unexpectedly
crisp
mouthfeel
there
are
some
funky
things
going
on
here
an
interesting
stout
thats
neither
easily
described
nor
easily
dismissed
somehow
this
beer
is
interesting
and
sort
of
fun
to
drink
at
least
once
not
risking
much
since
the
abv
is
so
low
drinkability
this
one
was
a
complete
bust
unfortunately
there
are
far
better
examples
of
this
style
and
id
wager
most
could
be
had
for
far
cheaper
than
this
one
if
you
must
insist
on
trying
this
one
get
the
smaller
size
a
slightly
above
average
stout
and
a
good
showing
from
japan
makes
for
a
one
time
buy
in
my
opinion
finish
is
sour
and
slightly
acidic
not
something
i
would
waste
my
money
on
again
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wont
be
running
out
to
buy
it
again
soon
but
i
say
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
go
ahead
and
pick
one
up
i
have
a
couple
of
other
hitachinos
in
my
fridge
i
have
higher
hopes
for
them
d
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
incredibly
dissapointed
cant
believe
this
was
recommended
to
me
i
would
hope
their
other
beers
are
better
d
this
might
pair
well
with
a
meal
but
by
itself
its
not
very
special
d
a
weird
brew
not
too
bad
but
a
lot
of
the
taste
i
wasnt
used
to
i
would
have
to
say
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
although
i
would
try
it
again
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
hitachino
nest
sweet
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thick
fluffy
tan
head
from
a
brown
one
pint
five
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
roasted
malt
being
most
noticeable
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
there
is
some
sweetness
and
even
some
tartness
too
the
roasted
malt
is
most
noticeable
toward
the
finish
this
is
a
different
take
for
sure
on
the
style
i
think
its
kind
of
average
to
perhaps
a
bit
above
average
overall
worth
a
try
if
only
for
the
cool
bottle
there
is
a
screened
on
label
with
an
odd
looking
owl
on
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
from
an
interesting
brewery
ive
got
to
say
all
of
the
beers
ive
tried
from
them
have
been
intriguing
and
the
white
ale
is
outstanding
definitely
a
brewery
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
and
different
tasting
beer
with
me
its
like
froachs
heather
ale
not
for
everyone
and
not
to
have
often
but
good
to
try
and
experience
and
revisit
after
awhile
this
was
unquestionably
the
worst
beer
i
had
ever
drunk
worst
of
all
i
paid
3
60
for
this
bottle
of
swill
i
love
this
brewery
taunting
owl
and
all
i
think
its
because
they
make
far
better
beer
than
anyone
expects
comming
out
of
japan
this
lactosweet
stout
is
very
good
for
its
style
but
the
style
is
a
bit
whacked
there
are
lots
of
sweet
malts
roasted
grain
creaminess
and
smoothness
rising
out
of
this
beer
however
the
lactose
sugars
are
very
strong
making
the
beer
overly
sweet
and
a
little
oily
i
often
get
a
grape
koolaid
flavor
from
milk
stouts
when
over
done
the
carbonation
seems
to
make
the
beer
prickly
and
too
efforvescent
on
the
toung
distracting
from
the
creamy
smooth
texture
but
an
easy
drinking
stout
regardless
notes
ehhh
for
the
price
id
avoid
this
forever
crux
obviously
this
isnt
the
same
beer
others
have
raved
about
great
bottle
label
graphics
though
drinkability
let
me
just
say
that
i
have
loved
every
kiuchi
brewery
beer
ive
tried
to
date
thats
why
i
picked
this
to
be
my
150th
review
but
i
must
say
i
am
disappointed
and
i
cannot
quite
recommend
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
okay
typcial
stout
but
the
strange
sour
and
somewhat
astringent
taste
affects
the
drinkability
not
horrible
but
what
exactly
is
this
sweet
stout
no
milk
stout
only
if
you
think
of
buttermilk
as
milk
not
that
bad
a
beer
but
not
that
great
a
beer
either
an
interesting
beer
that
i
just
really
cant
see
drinking
again
its
a
dark
blackishbrown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
shallow
wispy
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
lots
of
roasted
barley
its
got
a
sour
slightly
acidic
smell
also
the
taste
is
full
and
sweet
with
a
chocolate
milk
character
some
coffee
and
grain
as
well
its
a
little
oily
and
has
pretty
low
carbonation
the
sour
acidity
that
was
present
in
the
smell
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
if
it
was
intentional
or
if
there
was
some
bacterial
infection
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
concluded
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
lactic
acid
to
balance
the
lactose
different
thats
for
sure
again
very
little
hops
this
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
to
be
honest
i
was
pretty
disappointed
i
think
there
are
better
beers
of
this
particular
style
this
is
one
that
is
worth
a
taste
but
i
doubt
i
will
try
it
again
as
a
milk
stout
this
is
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
but
as
a
beer
i
just
love
it
it
has
so
many
of
the
characteristics
that
i
find
charming
and
addicting
in
lambics
gauzes
and
winter
saisons
absolutely
unique
and
innovative
this
beer
would
probably
be
a
good
session
beer
it
is
very
low
in
alcohol
so
that
definately
wouldnt
be
a
problem
also
the
flavor
is
not
offensive
or
overbearing
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
the
half
and
half
flavor
took
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
but
not
i
kind
of
like
it
d
i
would
call
this
a
japanese
stout
its
flavors
remind
me
of
the
taste
of
traditional
japanese
cuisine
very
soft
subtle
flavors
yet
complex
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
there
are
nuances
that
are
good
flavors
but
hard
to
describe
nice
beer
that
is
subtle
yet
mysteriously
interesting
dont
get
it
overall
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
there
are
roasted
flavors
but
rather
than
providing
balance
the
milk
sugars
overpower
them
a
nice
warm
up
to
the
evening
the
flavor
is
an
improvementthe
saltiness
is
present
but
muted
not
much
in
terms
of
roasted
flavors
the
body
is
very
thin
for
the
style
this
is
like
a
beginners
stout
for
those
who
are
not
ready
for
the
big
boys
from
ireland
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
weird
black
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
tart
smelling
there
may
be
some
chocolate
malts
in
here
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
tangy
crystal
and
black
malt
flavor
that
is
sweet
with
lactose
creamy
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
a
sweet
stout
i
liked
the
taste
although
it
was
a
bit
tangy
instead
of
retaining
a
true
stout
like
flavor
very
slighly
burned
black
but
not
quite
jet
medium
brown
dense
head
that
held
the
smell
was
fantastic
imo
with
tons
of
coffee
milk
and
brown
sugar
it
even
faded
and
hit
you
again
each
sniff
somewhat
overly
carbonated
causing
the
taste
to
be
a
bit
flighty
definite
milk
and
malt
but
it
comes
of
as
very
artificial
and
not
brewed
as
if
they
had
something
overly
malty
and
decided
to
add
sugar
and
halfandhald
as
an
afterthought
felt
ok
actually
quite
good
but
not
very
drinkable
as
inconsistent
and
generally
weird
as
it
is
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
love
it
or
hate
it
beers
without
much
middle
ground
poured
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
too
much
actually
once
that
had
disipated
sweet
chocolaty
aromas
were
present
taste
lots
of
sweetness
chocolate
some
caramel
and
malt
not
much
hops
you
can
tell
its
a
lacto
stout
very
candychocolate
like
mouthfeel
was
too
carbonated
but
not
bad
a
nice
drinkable
stout
at
3
9
if
you
like
a
sweet
stout
price
however
is
kinda
prohibitive
id
drink
it
again
but
the
cost
would
keep
me
away
when
theres
other
world
class
offerings
out
there
at
that
price
or
less
this
beer
sits
in
my
glass
a
dark
almost
black
color
it
shows
a
rich
brown
clear
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
wispy
and
light
brown
at
first
but
once
roused
shows
a
frothy
brown
head
the
aroma
smells
lightly
of
coffee
with
notes
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
astringent
roasted
grain
the
beer
is
surprisingly
dry
up
front
with
a
certain
acidity
to
it
that
seems
to
be
mainly
contributed
by
the
dark
malts
this
beer
has
notes
of
dark
chocolate
a
bit
of
lightly
acidic
espresso
and
even
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
this
beer
has
a
certain
fullness
to
it
as
it
hits
my
tongue
but
all
in
all
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
this
beer
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
sweet
stout
really
only
lightly
sweet
but
i
probably
like
it
better
because
of
this
interesting
not
bad
a
little
expensive
i
would
drink
this
again
especially
if
somebody
else
were
buying
hitachino
nest
sweet
stout
lacto
is
a
peculiar
beer
to
be
sure
that
peculiarity
rather
than
making
it
good
or
interesting
makes
it
not
so
good
and
not
that
interesting
the
major
culprit
i
believe
is
the
addition
of
the
lactose
it
has
more
than
enough
other
faults
but
losing
that
artificial
sweetness
would
at
least
clear
the
decks
so
that
the
malt
hops
and
yeast
could
be
appreciated
on
their
own
merits
the
beer
emerges
from
the
330ml
brown
bottle
a
soot
black
with
a
minimal
frothy
tan
head
that
vanishes
quickly
leaving
the
lace
thin
and
somewhat
patchy
nose
has
a
modest
roasted
grain
aroma
the
acidity
quite
noticeable
caramel
some
milk
sweetness
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
light
the
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
its
feel
finish
is
ferine
in
its
acidity
the
hops
present
but
light
the
aftertaste
chalky
and
dry
a
different
beer
for
sure
cannot
say
it
did
much
for
me
but
something
different
never
hurts
imho
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
too
its
definetly
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
but
it
probably
wont
be
on
your
most
favorite
list
the
taste
is
much
better
simultaneously
sweet
and
creamy
while
strangely
dry
and
chocolately
theres
nutty
toffee
aspect
and
a
pleasant
cocoa
powder
finsish
its
a
very
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
but
whether
its
worth
the
price
for
the
little
bottle
is
hard
to
say
i
found
this
beer
to
be
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
other
hitachino
beers
ive
tried
and
a
little
disappointing
ive
really
started
to
enjoy
the
flavors
in
sweet
and
milk
stouts
so
i
was
relaly
excited
to
see
this
on
tap
at
richos
the
beer
poured
a
flat
black
color
wtih
a
small
head
that
falls
to
barely
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
really
weak
with
only
some
light
chocolate
tones
coming
through
the
flavor
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
this
beer
was
really
bland
lacking
any
of
the
creamy
sweet
marshmellowey
characters
i
was
hoping
none
of
the
lacto
character
that
i
am
familiar
with
came
through
boo
on
this
beer
the
feel
was
too
thin
being
a
light
moderate
and
i
really
didt
think
the
drinability
was
all
that
good
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
11
2
ounce
bottle
skip
it
it
wasnt
sweet
and
it
wasnt
very
interesting
it
also
was
overpriced
at
4
per
bottle
i
must
have
gotten
a
good
bottle
cause
this
was
pretty
decent
had
a
nice
deep
dark
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
the
head
lasted
a
little
bit
then
died
out
to
a
laceing
smell
was
of
lactose
and
roasted
malts
taste
was
similar
but
a
little
more
with
a
chocolate
hint
in
it
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
not
as
good
as
mackesons
triple
stout
but
still
pretty
good
drinkability
nasty
sourness
makes
this
a
nasty
beer
could
be
a
bad
bottle
overall
pretty
drinkable
considering
i
dont
care
for
the
style
that
much
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
the
thin
tan
ring
of
remaining
head
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
aroma
is
sour
with
a
touch
of
chocolaty
sweetness
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
chocolte
taking
the
fore
and
a
very
slight
bit
of
bitterness
sneaking
in
easy
drinking
but
the
lactose
flavor
gets
old
pours
a
pitch
black
with
an
enormous
light
tan
head
some
deep
redmahogany
hues
dark
malt
aromas
and
some
sweet
milky
tones
noticable
somewhat
sour
nose
sour
metallic
flavors
upfront
sour
and
bitter
throughout
dry
bitter
finish
light
mouthfeel
lingering
quite
bitter
finish
dont
like
this
one
glad
to
try
it
but
wont
try
again
not
my
style
this
poured
out
with
way
too
much
head
it
took
quite
a
while
to
get
the
whole
bottle
in
a
16oz
glass
the
body
was
black
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
dies
fairly
quickly
and
left
some
scattered
lace
in
its
wake
a
bit
of
cream
in
the
nose
and
an
odd
sourness
overall
a
weak
unappealing
smell
taste
is
similar
to
soda
with
an
off
sour
taste
and
a
cream
presence
as
well
body
was
about
medium
with
no
notable
qualities
crap
for
drinkability
considering
the
offness
of
the
smell
and
taste
not
something
i
wish
to
try
again
and
a
huge
let
down
considering
how
excellent
their
celebration
ale
is
pours
a
dark
brown
to
near
black
colour
with
a
moderate
but
somewhat
sticky
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
caramel
and
malt
sweet
and
sugary
but
not
unbearable
the
flavour
is
most
definitely
sweet
and
chocolate
here
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
cut
down
upon
by
the
malt
caramel
intermingles
as
well
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
very
creamy
its
a
bit
thin
of
a
stout
but
its
a
diferent
kind
of
stout
so
its
to
be
expected
a
bit
could
i
drink
this
in
large
quantities
as
a
session
brew
no
way
is
it
a
nice
dessert
brew
or
one
to
sample
from
time
to
time
most
definitely
enjoyable
in
small
doses
id
say
had
this
one
in
a
25oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
died
off
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
has
caramel
malts
and
a
slight
bit
of
chocolate
and
maybe
even
a
little
sourness
the
flavor
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
sour
milk
mostly
and
some
roasted
malts
made
up
the
most
part
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
drinkability
is
low
too
bad
id
like
to
have
a
low
alcohol
beer
in
my
regular
rotation
sinkability

i
couldnt
finish
much
of
this
bottle
overall
not
as
sweet
as
i
first
expected
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
other
hitachino
beers
that
i
have
imbibed
to
date
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
dont
really
care
for
its
not
that
it
is
bad
or
even
revolting
but
it
is
different
worth
a
try
but
only
once
mid
you
drinkability
if
you
like
this
style
it
would
be
very
drinkable
because
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
not
too
filling
i
wont
drink
another
one
though
there
was
a
nice
roasted
foretaste
and
slight
sweetness
with
some
fruitiness
following
not
too
bad
a
beer
but
far
from
what
i
had
hoped
from
a
sweet
stout
drinkability
i
suppose
i
could
drink
several
of
these
just
not
sure
i
would
want
too
not
as
good
as
it
smells
an
off
taste
at
first
almost
sour
followed
by
a
mellow
sweetness
that
has
coffee
and
sugar
aspects
to
it
good
but
for
the
offputting
start
which
lowers
the
over
all
appeal
of
this
one
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
the
more
you
drink
the
better
it
gets
its
still
too
sweet
though
and
that
limits
how
often
youll
want
it
pours
a
deep
brown
colour
with
a
few
ruby
highlights
with
a
slight
tan
head
and
a
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
sharp
acidic
sweetness
a
bit
solvent
hinting
of
sourness
coffe
notes
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
waft
through
the
divide
the
flavour
seems
a
bit
sour
and
off
at
first
although
part
of
the
flavour
profile
the
sourness
takes
some
getting
used
to
lots
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
other
sweet
stout
delights
abound
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
but
maybe
im
distracted
by
all
the
unfamiliar
flavours
this
lacto
stout
is
unveiling
as
for
drinkability
im
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
per
session
its
rather
unique
it
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
roasted
coffe
but
sort
of
one
dimentional
the
taste
is
sweet
and
creamy
also
like
a
cappuccino
there
is
a
weird
sourness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
the
coffee
and
sweet
cream
tastes
highlighted
with
a
slight
sourness
is
worth
another
try
still
im
interested
to
see
what
they
would
do
with
an
imperial
stout
even
an
oatmeal
te
head
on
this
stout
more
of
a
crbonation
head
than
a
thick
foamy
head
found
on
some
stouts
it
was
a
dark
black
color
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
mahogony
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
at
first
a
roasted
malt
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
smell
this
is
a
very
easy
going
stout
in
that
the
flavors
have
smoothed
edges
as
opposed
to
being
aggressive
in
nature
the
roasted
malt
flavor
comes
in
first
and
finishes
with
a
soomth
but
light
sweetness
as
in
the
aroma
with
the
low
alc
and
easy
flavor
i
think
i
could
put
away
several
of
these
at
one
night
at
the
pub
very
interesting
try
it
just
to
see
what
you
think
i
dont
believe
ill
be
getting
this
again
though
i
wouldnt
mind
it
aroma
is
japanese
sour
cream
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
anybodys
stout
but
its
here
and
combines
with
coca
cola
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
to
provide
a
drinkable
and
challenging
experience
its
light
bodied
for
a
stout
and
has
respectable
components
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
notes
to
overpower
the
scalded
milk
notes
a
very
interesting
brew
indeed
if
you
enjoy
chocolate
on
your
cottage
cheese
you
will
definitely
like
this
stout
im
awarding
it
a
5
0
for
peculiarity
not
for
the
squeamish
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
some
of
the
roasted
notes
expected
from
a
stout
on
first
taste
i
get
some
sweetness
and
alcohol
then
a
short
burst
of
roasted
malt
it
finishes
rather
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
yet
coating
there
is
a
little
more
depth
as
it
warmsbut
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
this
its
not
a
bad
stout
but
certainly
not
anything
to
shout
about
a
review
of
a
beer
containing
lactose
milk
sugar
by
a
lactose
intolerant
person
may
be
prejudicial
but
here
it
is
anyway
this
beer
has
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
and
no
head
the
aroma
was
pretty
much
that
of
caramel
it
has
a
smooth
taste
of
sweet
milky
caramel
with
undertones
of
toasted
malt
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
as
well
the
hops
were
pretty
laid
back
with
only
a
little
bit
of
bite
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
doughy
with
not
much
carbonation
i
really
did
not
care
for
the
lactose
milk
sugar
after
taste
however
most
people
might
find
this
a
good
dessert
beer
ok
first
off
this
is
the
24oz
bottles
and
i
was
totally
hyped
on
the
bottle
it
looks
cool
as
hell
it
pours
dark
brown
not
black
and
with
really
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
somewhat
modest
and
contains
cocoa
malt
and
has
an
odd
spoiled
milk
smell
taste
wise
ugh
talk
about
a
let
down
it
honestly
tastes
like
crap
sure
theres
malty
chocolate
notes
but
theyre
smashed
by
the
odd
taste
of
rotten
milk
it
grossed
me
the
fk
out
i
mean
im
always
one
to
finish
a
beer
no
matter
how
bad
but
34
of
the
way
through
this
down
the
drain
it
went
it
was
crisp
but
thin
and
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
stout
total
bummer
and
expensive
not
gona
hit
this
one
up
again
ever
drinkability
im
sorry
to
say
i
finally
poured
this
beer
out
i
do
that
maybe
once
a
year
tops
i
gave
this
tasting
numerous
chances
letting
it
warm
up
etc
but
for
my
taste
this
brew
is
nearly
offensive
thin
dense
espresso
cremacolored
head
sweet
stout
is
very
very
dark
brown
in
color
and
smells
a
bit
like
kahlua
with
chocolate
and
cafe
latte
notes
the
taste
is
creamy
with
strong
coffee
and
cream
flavor
and
a
touch
of
dry
cocoa
the
influence
of
the
lactose
is
easy
to
detect
as
it
makes
this
brew
creamy
sweet
and
a
touch
sour
in
the
finish
nice
full
mouthfeel
this
beer
isnt
at
all
oppressive
especially
for
a
stout
and
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
overall
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
slightly
smoky
kahlua
flavor
ill
have
this
one
again
had
this
at
the
new
bukowskis
in
inman
sq
served
in
the
ceramic
hitachino
nest
glass
so
i
couldnt
get
a
good
look
at
the
color
head
is
the
color
of
a
chocolate
milk
shake
smell
is
distinctly
of
caramels
really
smells
of
caramels
as
the
beer
warmed
up
taste
creamy
and
milky
similar
to
1
milk
consistency
can
taste
the
lactose
and
the
sweet
caramel
and
malt
flavors
finishes
by
coating
the
back
of
my
throat
like
a
glass
of
milk
would
interesting
offering
worth
trying
but
not
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
although
its
quite
dark
it
has
a
hint
shows
a
hint
of
mahogany
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
heady
was
bubbly
but
disappeared
almost
immediately
without
a
trace
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
light
with
just
detectable
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
underwhelming
nothing
about
it
is
particularly
offensive
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
its
undoubtedly
watery
for
a
stout
although
its
only
3
9
it
doesnt
lend
itself
to
session
drinking
ill
pass
on
this
one
this
stout
poured
black
as
soy
sauce
with
a
creamy
tan
head
typical
nitrogen
foam
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
but
modest
the
taste
was
sweet
but
also
somewhat
tangy
almost
a
hint
of
tartness
tastes
of
malt
and
cocoa
were
evident
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
creamy
and
clean
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
feel
was
low
there
was
an
initial
tartness
on
the
tongue
which
gave
way
to
the
sweetness
this
was
a
good
stout
on
tap
i
liked
this
sample
better
than
the
bottle
i
had
sampled
in
the
us
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
moccha
highly
carbonated
fizzy
two
fingered
head
and
from
my
pour
is
leaving
no
lace
at
all
the
aroma
is
a
sharp
slightly
acidic
sweetness
this
is
my
first
time
grappling
with
a
milk
or
cream
stout
so
here
it
goes
underneath
of
the
harsh
sourness
are
light
coffe
tones
and
dark
chocolate
from
the
dark
roasted
barley
malt
the
flavor
at
first
seems
a
bit
offensive
from
the
rush
of
acidity
but
i
think
its
growing
on
me
after
my
fourth
sip
a
little
the
light
flavors
in
the
background
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
are
definitely
overshadowed
from
the
sourness
in
the
flavor
creating
an
unbalance
that
doesnt
form
a
happy
experience
with
me
nice
to
try
a
stout
from
a
japan
micro
but
i
will
try
the
hitachino
nest
wit
and
wheat
before
i
count
them
off
as
bad
brewers
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
this
lucious
style
of
a
stout
and
i
just
cant
get
down
with
this
beer
on
any
level
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sourness
overbears
the
rest
of
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
therefore
ruining
the
pleasures
this
beer
has
to
offer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
topped
by
a
rather
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
faily
modest
sweet
with
notes
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
odd
initially
presenting
a
slightly
sweet
roasted
taste
immediately
followed
by
a
tinge
of
sourness
the
dry
roasted
flavor
comes
back
for
the
finish
and
last
into
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
rejoined
by
the
slight
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
not
having
much
more
body
than
a
typical
lager
drinkability
is
not
great
because
its
just
not
that
enjoyable
i
guess
they
all
cant
be
good
beers
right
i
found
this
odd
since
a
lot
of
my
asian
friends
are
lactose
intolerant
which
and
i
may
be
misinformed
is
common
among
asian
folk
but
anyway
on
to
the
beer
its
a
nice
looking
stout
with
carbonation
galore
and
a
nice
head
boy
i
think
i
smelled
a
sweet
cider
smell
initially
but
then
i
could
detect
a
slight
roasted
malt
chocolate
aroma
come
through
bubbles
dance
on
the
dance
which
is
washed
away
with
a
milky
consistency
a
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
and
kinda
ends
with
a
tinge
of
sourness
each
sip
finishes
with
a
milky
feeling
this
was
a
hard
beer
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
remember
when
the
japanese
could
mimic
any
current
or
new
technology
and
then
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
cheaper
and
better
well
it
didnt
happen
here
what
the
hell
were
they
thinking
milk
sugar
in
a
beer
was
this
an
attempt
to
bring
back
distant
memories
or
should
i
say
mammaries
of
our
early
childhood
this
tar
colored
concoction
is
really
weird
a
sour
off
kilter
chocolate
taste
stands
out
followed
by
a
hint
of
camphor
and
pasty
malt
there
are
hops
somewhere
but
if
im
not
mistaken
tastes
like
old
apple
juice
the
smell
is
strange
as
well
a
cross
between
chocolate
and
sour
balls
candy
the
head
disappeared
too
quickly
for
me
ponder
their
existence
but
i
was
distracted
trying
to
contemplate
what
the
heck
i
was
drinking
i
did
a
double
take
when
i
tasted
it
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
stout
at
all
but
it
looks
like
one
so
its
something
of
a
neat
trick
the
word
lacto
on
the
bottle
implies
that
theyre
going
for
milky
feel
and
taste
and
thats
what
they
get
so
kudos
to
them
on
that
alone
not
entirely
what
id
hoped
for
though
since
i
generally
think
of
stouts
as
a
bit
more
robust
and
well
ballsy
easy
to
drink
because
its
so
thin
not
a
terrible
beer
and
it
is
certainly
unique
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
a
lot
dark
but
not
completely
opaque
nice
chunky
tan
head
starts
off
nicely
but
fades
fairly
quickly
for
a
stout
not
very
big
nose
but
some
cream
the
flavor
is
some
roastiness
and
chocolate
but
its
dominated
by
the
sourness
its
also
fairly
sweet
the
flavor
is
way
too
thin
for
a
good
stout
in
fact
more
malt
would
probably
balance
out
the
sourness
after
all
bells
can
make
great
stouts
despite
the
sourness
the
body
is
also
on
the
thin
side
f
pours
an
almost
completely
opaque
black
with
minimal
hazy
brown
highlights
at
the
rim
a
short
but
creamy
dark
tan
head
soon
drops
to
a
collar
it
does
howwever
last
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
somewhat
limited
but
offers
a
thin
roastiness
and
a
mildly
tart
fruitiness
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
fine
and
mild
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
thats
silky
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
quite
intriguing
and
not
at
all
whats
normally
expected
of
a
sweet
stout
it
starts
lightly
fruity
turning
gently
tart
and
warms
to
reveal
some
dark
toffee
and
bakers
chocolate
followed
by
the
promised
sweetness
before
finishing
with
a
lightly
dry
and
mildly
roasty
finish
its
quite
unique
as
are
all
of
the
hitachino
nest
beers
with
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
refreshing
fairly
complex
and
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
certainly
worth
trying
for
those
who
seek
unusual
beers
this
maybe
the
best
japanese
stout
i
have
come
across
although
it
is
a
bit
watery
it
has
a
lovely
dark
chocolate
aroma
it
has
a
high
acidity
which
i
believe
makes
it
refreshing
which
is
not
a
characteristic
found
in
stouts
it
is
definitely
brewed
with
the
japanese
consumer
in
mind
as
i
have
not
had
beers
from
other
countries
with
such
high
acidity
other
reviewers
stated
they
noted
sour
taste
acidity
is
often
mistaken
for
sour
taste
in
drinks
such
as
wine
and
sake
especially
by
drinkers
who
are
sensitive
to
acidity
i
challenge
you
who
think
this
is
a
sour
brew
to
reconsider
you
position
cheers
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
bit
off
maybe
a
few
too
many
warm
closet
days
but
its
sweetstout
heart
is
still
strong
sweet
toasty
and
earth
stout
cheers
aromas
of
chocolate
skim
milk
and
soy
decent
retention
of
the
lattecolored
head
wispy
watery
chocolate
flavors
surround
mild
bitterness
mexican
mole
moelay
and
water
cracker
notes
not
heavy
if
it
was
not
for
the
addition
of
lacto
sugar
this
brew
would
be
nearly
undrinkable
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
with
a
hearty
meal
and
perhaps
too
full
of
a
brew
that
you
would
want
as
a
session
style
beer
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
notes
kiuchi
brewery
produces
some
outstanding
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
theres
nothing
sweet
about
this
beer
its
horribly
balanced
and
the
use
of
lacto
in
this
beer
is
abusive
and
overwhelming
to
the
point
of
making
it
nearly
undrinkable
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
and
formed
a
medium
bubbly
tan
head
that
receeded
quickly
and
left
some
lace
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
some
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
chocolate
the
lacto
may
account
for
the
sour
taste
and
finish
to
the
beer
any
hopes
of
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
are
hurt
by
that
aspect
of
the
beer
a
weird
concept
to
try
with
a
beer
drinks
nice
but
seems
a
bit
faded
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
sweeter
as
this
is
faily
dry
there
is
some
mild
roast
on
the
ending
really
smooth
and
great
taste
its
ok
it
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
thousands
of
other
stouts
out
there
nothing
exceptional
but
a
great
easy
milk
stout
a
nice
smooth
ale
good
taste
pours
an
almost
black
with
a
khaki
colored
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
subtle
but
there
are
hints
of
milk
chocolate
and
sweet
cream
the
taste
was
nice
with
the
sweet
flavors
coming
through
in
the
beginning
and
then
having
some
of
the
coffee
on
the
end
gave
the
beer
a
nice
balance
that
makes
it
so
the
richness
isnt
too
overpowering
i
dont
want
to
review
a
o
a
calm
and
subtle
milk
stout
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
sweet
cream
profiles
a
likable
example
of
the
style
if
you
enjoy
the
style
and
find
yourself
in
new
york
state
i
would
give
it
a
shot
it
is
super
no
light
can
be
seen
through
it
the
pour
into
a
glass
barely
has
any
head
for
as
dark
as
it
looks
it
doesnt
have
that
heavy
after
taste
dark
brews
have
in
the
bottle
its
good
on
tap
it
is
amazing
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
to
date
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
i
have
ever
tried
keegan
ales
should
be
proud
that
they
make
a
product
this
amazing
great
beer
overall
this
was
enjoyed
as
a
group
with
the
groomsmentobe
from
our
wedding
party
after
enjoying
a
curiously
calming
and
leisurely
200
am
stroll
around
spanish
harlem
we
found
ourselves
in
the
possession
of
a
six
pack
of
this
guy
and
although
not
all
of
the
gentlemen
present
traditionally
enjoy
dark
beers
we
each
were
able
to
enjoy
this
one
our
guess
is
that
it
was
due
to
the
cloying
syrupy
sugariness
of
the
flavoring
but
with
just
enough
balance
from
the
metallics
roastiness
and
lactic
bitterness
to
keep
any
one
thing
from
being
too
offensive
the
nose
smelled
on
the
sweet
side
but
its
main
constitution
was
otherwise
reminiscent
of
a
silky
american
porter
while
most
of
you
wont
find
yourself
on
the
far
north
side
of
manhattan
in
the
middle
of
the
night
this
beer
served
wonderfully
as
a
nightcap
persuading
even
the
toughest
of
customers
serving
type
bottle
o
solid
but
nothing
stands
out
with
so
many
other
great
one
of
the
style
o
really
solid
not
my
favorite
ever
but
quite
nice
and
good
tasting
i
really
like
the
coffee
forward
flavor
price
point
212
oz
single
o
overall
a
simple
but
solid
milk
stout
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
the
style
and
could
see
this
being
a
good
starter
stout
for
some
new
craft
beer
drinkers
this
is
in
the
top
5
milk
stouts
ive
had
quite
good
overall
original
most
smokey
nostalgic
romantic
for
smokers
and
for
wood
fire
builders
hudson
valley
dwellers
or
river
valley
dwellers
down
here
in
the
holler
the
smoke
nestles
i
was
harsh
in
my
initial
review
but
upon
second
and
third
tries
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
the
carbonation
is
still
a
bit
too
much
but
the
overall
taste
including
the
somewhat
hoppy
finish
wins
out
overall
not
the
best
milk
stout
ive
had
thats
for
sure
that
said
the
draft
beers
at
this
bar
seemed
to
be
experiencing
some
problems
in
general
overall
this
was
just
a
little
too
light
and
sweet
it
needed
more
roast
and
more
body
to
get
to
where
it
should
have
been
going
being
a
city
boy
mothers
milk
made
me
feel
like
a
woodsman
relaxing
after
a
long
day
of
work
while
lighter
than
your
typical
stout
keegan
ales
produced
a
truly
smooth
perfectly
balanced
dark
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
great
option
for
a
heavy
beer
without
taking
up
room
otherwise
allocated
for
a
burger
at
the
pub
o
good
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
to
be
fair
sweet
stouts
are
not
my
favorite
style
the
flavor
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
with
subtle
caramel
accent
and
light
roasted
taste
of
barley
with
some
gentle
cocoalike
elements
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
is
not
overdone
and
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
to
keep
it
balanced
with
some
light
alcohol
and
dry
taste
toward
the
finish
this
is
a
beer
i
have
wanted
to
try
and
i
enjoyed
it
it
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
and
was
very
drinkable
without
being
too
sweet
oa
solid
milk
stout
with
good
flavor
and
nice
creamy
feel
delicious
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
stout
i
would
totally
drink
this
again
real
smooth
and
what
i
had
hoped
served
pretty
cold
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
abv
6er
on
a
lawnmower
or
while
chopping
wood
i
want
to
make
some
lactose
type
of
beers
and
explore
their
possibilities
so
i
am
trying
the
available
lactose
beers
overall
interesting
take
on
the
milk
stout
if
you
like
them
a
bit
more
bittersweet
than
lactose
sweet
this
is
a
solid
brew
to
try
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
because
im
a
guy
who
likes
his
milk
stouts
in
the
latter
category
enjoyed
trying
this
one
though
3
5
pretty
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
try
but
would
not
seek
it
out
i
just
love
this
beer
its
sensual
i
want
to
gaze
at
the
richness
and
definitive
color
the
appearance
of
the
beer
inspires
me
to
write
hate
mail
to
stella
and
pbr
the
nose
is
extremely
telling
and
true
to
the
display
of
flavors
rich
sweet
milky
caramel
smooth
a
respectable
body
while
maintaining
delicacy
please
serve
this
to
me
in
the
correct
glass
i
swear
it
matters
the
pour
crests
at
about
a
fingers
worth
of
rich
dark
foam
subsides
swiftly
down
to
a
consistent
surface
coating
then
finally
pulls
away
to
the
glass
sides
the
lacing
is
wispy
and
without
stickiness
the
liquid
is
a
superclean
opaque
black
hints
of
brown
to
yellow
at
the
glass
bottom
and
rims
no
visible
bubbles
the
nose
consists
mostly
of
roasted
cocoa
sweet
baked
bread
anise
caramel
and
cola
bean
trace
of
plum
actually
comes
off
angular
and
dry
so
that
any
milkiness
seems
lost
in
the
shuffle
not
overly
roasted
but
lifts
well
mediumbodied
while
on
the
firm
and
muscular
side
not
softly
textured
the
carbonation
is
light
however
it
does
last
fully
through
each
sip
again
not
that
milky
per
se
more
crisper
cocoa
mocha
to
coffee
notes
along
with
cola
orange
peel
molasses
crisp
and
pine
given
the
higher
level
of
roast
harder
to
discern
clearly
the
hoppy
bite
but
one
suspects
it
is
higher
than
usual
for
the
category
mix
of
black
fruits
sweeten
the
midpalate
overall
falls
on
the
dry
side
so
theres
no
real
naturally
sweet
length
fairly
sessionable
and
neutral
enough
to
be
versatile
at
the
dinner
table
probably
would
benefit
from
slightly
more
sweetness
and
general
liveliness
o
good
beer
but
really
disappointed
in
the
carbonation
pours
smooth
very
black
fast
acting
brown
foam
little
remains
light
roasted
nose
some
dark
chocolate
pokes
through
milky
sweet
roastingbitter
really
takes
a
back
seat
very
minor
carbonation
milky
lactose
finish
which
becomes
more
cumbersome
as
the
beer
is
finished
very
interesting
flavor
profile
but
a
one
and
done
for
sure
odpretty
neat
its
always
a
treat
to
enjoy
a
flavorful
stout
that
is
well
below
8
a
sixer
of
these
would
go
down
with
ease
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
known
or
would
consider
it
a
milk
stout
the
aromas
and
flavor
profile
was
much
more
roasted
than
i
expected
with
less
sweeter
notes
than
i
expected
there
was
a
lacking
sweetness
or
creaminess
to
the
mouthfeel
that
is
neededexpected
for
the
style
overall
an
excellent
milk
stoutid
happily
have
this
again
but
not
with
a
light
lunchitd
be
better
as
an
evening
beer
o
overall
a
very
thin
watery
example
lifeless
flavor
lacks
substance
and
passes
off
the
tongue
without
hardly
raising
an
eyebrow
in
between
a
shade
below
average
enjoyment
becomes
mundane
less
then
half
way
through
a
single
serving
drinkability
could
be
a
good
goto
come
winter
time
easy
drinking
and
balanced
enough
to
go
back
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
milk
stout
id
say
its
worth
a
try
for
anyone
that
is
looking
for
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
is
this
top
tier
in
its
category
not
quite
but
still
good
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
nothingness
on
the
nose
i
noticed
elements
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
moderate
amount
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
quite
roasty
and
not
as
sweet
i
expected
what
i
noticed
most
was
the
taste
of
the
roasted
barley
i
am
not
the
most
fond
of
stouts
and
generally
find
them
quite
heavy
this
is
a
stout
that
i
can
find
myself
ordering
when
i
find
myself
in
a
stout
mood
pours
out
a
dark
brown
but
settles
into
a
jet
black
body
inside
the
glass
a
thin
mocha
colored
head
quickly
disappears
unfortunatly
there
is
no
lacing
or
retention
the
nose
is
lactos
mainly
some
roasted
malts
in
the
background
taste
is
very
sweet
like
adding
cream
to
coffee
picking
up
on
some
roasted
coffee
on
the
finish
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
me
and
carbonation
could
be
better
rich
creamy
feel
with
some
coffee
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
just
not
one
of
the
top
tier
milk
stouts
out
there
i
would
drink
this
again
cause
it
is
good
just
not
mind
blowing
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
creamy
dense
low
profile
tan
head
with
great
retention
aromas
of
blended
cream
coffee
and
subtle
chocolate
flavors
are
dry
with
a
rich
smokey
cream
backbone
and
some
subtle
bitter
coffee
highlights
very
smooth
and
well
blended
with
a
rich
sweet
aftertaste
smooth
creamy
finish
very
well
balanced
very
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
this
beer
could
easily
be
drankdrunk
all
night
long
nice
complexity
to
the
smell
and
taste
picked
up
a
single
at
euro
market
in
astoria
no
surprise
pours
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
milk
chocolate
light
roast
and
lactose
the
flavor
and
feel
however
is
a
drier
with
less
cocoa
there
are
hints
of
mocha
and
brown
barley
the
body
is
medium
a
normal
thickness
and
that
sort
of
sums
up
the
beer
its
a
normal
milk
stout
its
clean
and
hits
the
right
notes
for
an
american
milk
stout
i
find
the
british
ones
to
be
sweeter
not
surprising
it
reminds
me
of
left
hands
milk
stout
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
granted
i
do
not
drink
milk
stouts
all
the
time
and
honestly
i
do
truly
love
how
it
is
presented
it
is
sweet
but
not
like
soda
and
liht
bitterness
and
a
whole
feel
to
it
that
reminds
you
it
should
be
used
to
compliment
desserts
to
the
best
of
the
them
salud
o
pretty
good
stout
offering
nice
balance
between
usual
roasted
taste
along
with
a
certain
amount
chocolate
sweetness
tasty
and
would
drink
again
a
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
likes
but
something
i
would
have
again
overall
really
happy
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
would
have
another
4
good
stout
not
amazing
but
really
nice
and
smooth
drinkable
stout
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
good
stout
for
the
masses
olooks
and
tastes
very
good
i
like
stout
and
ill
go
back
to
this
one
o
i
like
this
stout
a
lot
but
its
not
as
good
as
joe
mamas
milk
stout
overall
man
i
should
have
got
some
more
of
this
about
to
try
a
left
hand
again
to
see
if
its
this
good
but
a
very
solid
milk
stout
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
brew
itself
drinks
like
milk
so
be
forewarned
definitely
good
for
the
winter
months
season
and
is
a
worthy
find
indeed
overall
good
i
dont
know
if
this
would
be
something
i
would
get
again
and
again
but
i
would
have
it
from
time
to
time
35
o
this
is
an
okay
milk
stout
but
the
left
hand
and
lancaster
milk
stouts
are
better
in
my
opinion
the
taste
profile
makes
me
wonder
how
fresh
this
bottle
is
with
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
i
cant
adjust
my
score
to
reflect
any
possible
degradation
from
age
i
can
drink
this
but
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
beer
after
i
finish
the
six
pack
serving
type
ontap
overall
this
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
milk
stout
i
found
it
overly
sweet
but
for
the
price
it
is
worth
a
try
o
pretty
decent
milk
stout
not
in
my
top
5
though
d
dark
and
mild
with
a
nice
combination
of
dark
sugar
and
roasted
malt
overall
this
was
generally
lousy
the
only
saving
grace
was
the
nose
and
thats
just
because
at
least
it
smelt
like
a
milk
stout
the
look
was
atrocious
and
the
feel
disappointing
at
best
while
the
flavor
was
basically
just
flavor
in
name
hopefully
this
was
just
a
lousy
batch
and
other
incarnations
are
not
this
uneventful
on
to
the
bigger
brother
cheers
o
a
completely
enjoyable
totally
drinkable
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
nice
stout
feels
great
smells
great
but
the
taste
seems
a
little
weaker
than
the
aroma
this
is
a
all
around
wonderful
brew
and
should
be
tried
if
given
the
chance
nothing
special
about
this
one
but
nothing
needs
to
be
its
just
a
solid
enjoyable
milk
stout
overall
a
wellbrewed
straightforward
example
of
the
style
touch
of
dark
chocolate
very
straightforward
and
dry
finish
is
earth
and
and
more
earth
clean
and
dry
with
faint
latte
notes
bit
of
mild
molasses
feel
is
crisp
and
mildly
creamy
as
it
is
kinda
light
and
easy
drinkin
a
quaffing
milk
stout
and
a
nice
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
starter
stout
for
those
who
are
looking
for
a
nonguinness
stout
experience
perfect
for
dessert
pairings
chocolate
chocolate
chocolate
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
in
this
one
a
genuinely
great
brew
o
a
bit
hard
to
finish
the
glass
the
sweetness
was
too
much
i
needed
a
bit
more
balance
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
lactose
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
dark
malt
burnt
sugar
and
some
slight
cocoa
flavors
there
is
a
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
with
an
emphasis
on
roast
aromas
and
flavors
overall
drinkabiilty
its
a
bit
like
having
a
thin
chocolate
milkshake
with
a
burger
which
is
what
i
had
with
this
beer
tasty
smooth
what
else
do
you
want
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
and
did
in
this
case
my
friend
who
was
having
one
as
well
commented
that
this
would
be
great
with
breakfast
and
i
agree
cheers
o
way
better
than
i
had
expected
nicely
complex
i
would
see
this
as
a
great
brew
for
a
day
of
being
snowed
in
really
surprised
by
this
one
and
pleasantly
so
excellent
stout
ive
had
a
few
times
at
other
places
since
my
initial
tasting
not
an
enormous
booze
monster
so
it
wont
be
a
favorite
of
some
but
i
enjoyed
this
beers
subtler
aspects
and
ease
of
drinkablility
curious
about
how
it
translates
to
the
bottle
o
could
have
been
my
growler
but
this
seems
to
be
off
ive
had
it
before
and
it
was
nothing
but
sweet
milk
stout
goodness
rereview
in
order
another
well
crafted
sweet
stout
eminently
enjoyable
taste
hits
the
mark
for
right
balance
of
sweetness
to
dryness
has
an
almost
mocha
head
that
holds
nicely
a
milk
chocolate
impression
on
the
taste
buds
another
selection
i
would
add
to
my
braukeller
tommy
keegan
hit
this
one
right
on
the
money
thanks
to
by
buddy
visiting
from
new
paltz
who
brought
me
a
couple
of
sixpacks
of
this
tasty
stout
really
nice
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
foamy
tancoffee
colored
head
aroma
is
a
nice
coffee
scent
a
little
bit
burnt
very
enjoyable
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
the
burntroasted
elements
of
a
stout
goes
down
very
easily
i
wish
this
was
something
we
could
get
on
a
regular
basis
in
connecticut
o
great
beer
thats
extremely
easy
to
drink
whenever
could
definitely
drink
56
of
these
easily
perfect
for
dinner
dessert
or
by
itself
o
a
good
beer
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
but
the
flavor
is
rather
light
has
some
decent
flavor
o
overall
this
is
a
great
local
offering
and
it
is
nice
to
be
able
to
find
fresh
versions
of
keegan
brews
i
would
like
to
see
greater
expansion
for
keegan
but
a
great
extra
for
trades
since
they
are
solid
good
milk
stout
maybe
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
nice
fizziness
takes
away
from
it
quite
a
bit
though
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
milk
stouts
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
tan
headlacing
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
smell
nice
and
rich
really
chocolately
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
taste
of
dark
cocoa
powder
in
the
back
of
the
throat
malted
flavor
like
a
milkshake
very
nice
dessert
beer
beer
is
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
or
liked
but
the
flavor
is
there
and
the
taste
is
long
lasting
cocoa
powder
really
lasts
in
the
flavor
profile
this
would
go
fantastic
with
vanilla
ice
cream
not
the
most
complex
but
the
flavors
are
well
developed
if
it
had
a
richer
mouthfeel
this
beer
would
be
top
notch
this
isnt
terribly
strong
for
a
stout
either
and
i
could
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
because
this
is
so
filling
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
would
probably
be
tricky
there
wasnt
a
strong
hint
of
lactose
or
sugar
in
this
but
this
stays
pretty
true
to
form
and
would
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
looking
to
end
the
day
with
a
tasteful
and
filling
stout
overall
a
really
solid
beer
highly
recommended
great
local
brew
mothers
milk
straight
from
the
source
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
help
but
think
a
little
more
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
would
do
this
beer
some
good
it
kind
of
just
glides
along
without
much
direction
reminds
me
of
something
in
between
a
guinness
draught
and
extra
stout
not
quite
as
roasty
and
flavorful
as
the
extra
but
has
the
smooth
creaminess
and
light
flavor
of
the
draught
i
must
admit
i
am
on
the
fence
with
this
one
rarely
does
a
whole
12
oz
beer
disappear
from
my
glass
before
i
finish
my
review
yet
i
feel
like
i
want
a
bit
more
boldness
and
flavor
out
of
this
one
strange
yet
compelling
brew
overall
not
the
best
example
of
a
sweet
stout
and
though
it
good
use
a
fuller
taste
the
body
makes
it
good
and
worth
a
passing
glance
doverall
i
really
wouldnt
call
this
a
milk
stouts
wasnt
sweet
enough
it
was
ok
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
sweet
and
creamyness
o
not
as
sweet
as
expected
for
a
milk
stout
as
there
is
ample
amounts
of
roasted
coffee
and
charred
wood
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
o
this
is
a
tasty
slightly
sweeter
stout
that
hits
the
right
spots
and
does
a
nice
job
good
flavor
profiles
but
nothing
outlandish
cheers
creamy

the

a

of
the
sweet

come
out

with
the

nothing
terribly
off
about
this

just
not
a
very
strong

profile
or
body
over
a
finger
of
creamy
head
a
nice
dollop
of
retention
but
not
a
whole
bit
of
lacing
aromas
and
flavors
both
bring
out
the
chocolate
oatmeal
and
berries
of
a
lightly
roasted
nature
the
flavors
emphasize
the
bitterness
of
the
chocolate
and
coffee
at
least
for
a
while
it
seemed
after
a
few
minutes
the
flavors
lost
their
edge
and
the
beer
became
a
little
watery
i
dont
know
if
ill
seek
this
out
again
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
overall
a
good
stout
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
body
and
bitterness
thin
for
the
style
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
flavor
has
a
combination
of
toasted
bread
and
burnt
coffee
theres
a
shot
of
bittering
hop
at
the
swallow
but
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
black
patent
malt
flavors
not
really
sweet
or
creamy
but
its
tasty
overall
lack
luster
best
characteristic
was
the
color
way
too
light
and
empty
no
body
to
this
beer
was
its
greatest
dissapointment
not
smooth
on
the
finish
i
had
been
told
but
a
silky
finish
made
sense
overall
very
nice
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
full
flavored
and
quite
delicious
highly
recommended
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
pours
an
enormous

of

if

some

some
roasted

tastes
of
coffee
roasty
some
cream
finishes
dry
and
roasty
touch
of
lingering
bitterness
thin
bodied
light
mouthfeel
not
what
i
was
expecting
1
89
a
single
the
taste
to
me
was
exactly
like
the
smell
it
had
a
roasty
kind
of
taste
with
subtle
chocolatecoffee
hybrid
flavors
infused
as
might
be
expected
this
beer
was
just
a
little
bit
sweet
as
previously
mentioned
this
beer
has
a
really
thick
body
and
a
noticeably
heavy
mouthfeel
its
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
but
it
gets
a
little
sticky
afterward
which
just
encourages
a
followup
swig
overall
decent
but
nothing
exceptional
or
memorable
about
this
beer
might
make
for
a
good
sessionable
stout
but
its
hard
to
know
because
i
cant
seem
to
find
the
abv
anywhere
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
cheers
medium
in
body
with
pretty
decent
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
sweet
stouts
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
work
very
well
together
the
sweetness
is
nice
and
it
does
not
ever
feel
like
too
much
very
smooth
and
creamy
mothers
milk
great
name

dark

not

some

chocolate
tastes
of
roasted

and
milk
chocolate
with
some
dark
chocolate
cocoa
at
the
end
was
not
as
smooth
or
as
viscous
as
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
thin
drinkable
though
keegan
ales
2
for
2
solid
beers
d
great
all
around
beer
and
im
positive
theres
another
six
pack
in
my
future
drinability
is
good
its
a
tasty
sweet
stout
and
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
in
a
session
d
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
i
could
keep
on
drinking
these
all
night
long
drinkability
a
solid
stout
overall
not
outstanding
but
well
worth
a
drink
this
would
make
for
good
afterdinner
fare
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
average
to
good
thinner
body
for
a
stout
some
lingering
dry
feel
pretty
smooth
drinking
although
everything
felt
a
little
dialed
down
drinkability
is
quite
good
not
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
enough
to
merit
a
revisit
a
good
brew
with
which
to
sit
back
and
close
out
the
night
overall
not
a
very
good
stout
nothing
seems
to
work
for
this
beer
way
to
roasted
and
burnt
tasting
i
wont
be
able
to
finish
much
of
this
beer
bottle
poured
into
a
duck
rabbit
snifter
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
tan
tiny
bubbled
head
that
leaves
a
nice
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
settles
dark
roast
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
leather
in
the
nose
reminds
me
of
smelling
a
chocolate
malt
creamy
light
mouthfeel
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
aroma
with
a
sweet
start
followed
by
bitter
leather
and
a
lingering
over
roasted
coffee
flavor
o
i
like
my
stouts
to
have
a
little
more
body
but
the
flavors
are
all
there
a
nice
milk
stout
drinkabilityis
quite
good
im
trying
to
slow
my
pace
down
as
the
beer
is
disappearing
from
my
glass
very
quickly
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
very
nice
milk
stout
with
plenty
of
traditional
character
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
mothers
milk
is
pretty
good
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
a
milk
stout
and
just
a
normal
roasted
single
american
stout
creamy
tasting
with
good
carbonation
the
chocolate
syrup
aroma
lends
way
to
a
bitter
sweet
chocolate
taste
well
balanced
plenty
of
sweetened
roasted
coffee
flavor
the
abv
is
around
5
which
makes
this
stout
highly
drinkable
i
was
told
they
do
an
imperial
version
which
i
need
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
overall
a
good
pleasing
session
stout
very
drinkable
good
session
brew
noy
at
all
heavy
like
a
regular
stout
decent
cream
stout
if
i
wasnt
brewing
a
cream
stout
i
would
buy
more
sometimes
the
hot
season
finds
you
desperate
for
a
winter
beer
who
knows
why
poured
a
chestnut
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
died
quick
and
left
little
lace
strong
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
some
sweet
malts
like
cocoa
in
the
back
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
sweet
malts
like
cocoa
caramel
and
vanilla
are
in
a
medium
body
that
is
slightly
chewey
but
the
biggest
taste
is
of
the
roasted
malts
finishes
dry
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
not
the
greatest
milk
stout
as
it
could
be
slightly
more
sweet
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
yeah
this
is
drinkable
the
taste
is
the
strong
suit
for
this
offering
if
it
was
bigger
or
more
complex
this
would
be
a
great
beer
above
average
as
is
i
would
buy
and
drink
again
overall
a
nice
little
session
ale
not
sure
what
was
up
with
the
look
on
this
one
but
would
drink
it
again
notes
this
is
an
excellent
sessionable
hopefully
considering
no
list
abv
stout
that
i
can
always
fall
back
on
when
its
cold
outside
very
satisfying
beer
on
tap
in
a
rare
move
for
me
i
orderd
a
second
versus
venturing
on
to
the
next
beer
just
so
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
would
i
buy
more
of
it
id
love
to
try
this
on
nitro
tap
it
seems
like
a
great
candidate
drinkability
quite
sessionable
but
id
like
more
flavor
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sweet
stouts
this
one
was
a
little
better
than
most
but
i
dont
think
ill
order
it
again
very
dark
stout
color
sweet
flavor
with
very
little
carbonation
i
really
had
no
idea
what
the
abv
was
but
it
seemed
stronger
than
i
thought
drinkability
is
excellent
very
nice
beer
which
is
enjoyable
and
drinks
easy
the
lower
score
is
partial
due
to
preference
and
personal
opinion
of
the
style
this
beer
may
be
better
than
the
score
i
give
it
while
lacking
a
bit
in
terms
of
my
personal
preference
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
first
impression
of
keegan
ales
is
good
i
am
curious
to
try
the
other
i
have
in
my
possession
finish
is
bitter
coffee
character
all
around
but
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
stout
there
is
just
nothing
really
very
good
about
it
poured
into
a
sampling
glass
at
the
brewery
but
subsequently
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
at
house
of
brews
nyc
with
similar
results
poured
black
with
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
and
great
lacing
it
smelled
of
roasted
malt
smokiness
and
coffee
nicely
balanced
between
sweetnonsweet
the
taste
begins
with
a
robust
roasted
smoky
toffee
flavor
which
dissolved
to
coffee
midpalate
and
then
finished
on
a
sweeter
than
expected
note
very
nice
flavor
progression
velvety
smooth
medium
body
helped
in
part
by
very
little
carbonation
and
creamy
not
a
huge
fan
of
sweet
stouts
but
this
is
one
that
i
can
certainly
session
overall
this
is
by
far
the
lowest
abv
milk
stout
ive
come
across
and
its
also
one
of
the
best
its
definitely
got
more
of
an
edge
than
others
in
the
style
but
its
very
much
worth
a
shot
d
the
incredible
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
lends
itself
to
drinkability
the
flavor
wasnt
as
complex
or
sweet
as
i
was
expected
just
a
slightly
above
average
coffee
tasting
stout
in
taste
imo
i
good
brew
overall
on
another
note
i
also
tasted
it
from
a
tap
which
was
poured
into
a
rocks
glass
the
taste
and
feel
remained
the
same
but
it
didnt
have
the
bubbles
that
were
there
when
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
i
dont
know
what
that
means
very
drinkable
stout
with
great
flavor
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
given
the
smoothness
and
lighter
bodied
nature
of
the
beer
an
excellent
sessiontype
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
smooth
and
refreshing
drinkability
high
it
is
slightly
thinner
in
the
mouth
than
i
expected
but
not
a
huge
deal
no
aftertaste
at
all
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
between
front
palate
sweetness
and
back
palate
bitterness
from
the
roast
there
is
no
hop
character
in
this
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
definitely
worth
a
look
d
very
drinkable
this
is
easy
and
enjoyable
to
polish
off
and
easy
to
polish
off
another
d
this
a
mild
and
drinkable
yet
fullflavored
stout
the
taste
is
where
this
one
stood
out
for
me
although
some
of
the
other
components
could
improve
i
would
drink
this
regularly
were
i
lucky
enough
to
have
keegan
as
a
local
brewery
truly
my
favorite
stout
to
reach
for
on
any
given
night
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
good
this
stout
is
from
keegan
and
pairing
it
with
a
kitkat
candy
bar
would
very
well
it
is
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
any
chocolatley

to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
slightly

tasted
really
thin
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
robust
this
poured
an
opaque
dark
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
there
is
definitely
roasted
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
bread
on
the
nose
at
first
i
dont
get
much
flavour
but
there
is
that
espresso
and
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
short
time
funny
enough
that
as
it
warms
up
the
flavour
profile
does
change
a
bit
almost
reminding
me
of
a
cold
double
double
from
your
local
coffee
shop
the
carbonation
balances
the
mouthfeel
down
a
notch
to
a
high
medium
i
think
this
one
of
those
beers
that
would
benefit
as
a
nitro
just
to
smooth
it
out
a
bit
more
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
darker
beers
i
read
about
milk
stouts
and
was
interested
so
i
went
out
and
got
a
bottle
of
this
confirmed
my
opinion
on
the
brew
on
nitro
at
the
taproom
the
pour
results
in
a
very
slight
fizzy
khaki
colored
head
the
quickly
disappears
what
remains
is
a
very
slight
lacing
and
thin
to
moderate
collar
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
bursting
through
the
surface
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
that
allows
a
bit
of
light
to
leak
in
around
the
edges
providing
a
light
reddish
hue
of
undertones
the
aroma
is
exactly
as
expected
and
rather
enjoyable
mild
espresso
is
at
the
forefront
of
each
and
every
whiff
next
in
line
is
the
roasted
malt
finally
there
are
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
the
flavor
profile
is
much
more
muted
than
i
would
have
expected
based
on
the
stellar
aroma
everything
seems
to
be
watered
down
a
notch
or
two
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
some
fizzy
carbonation
to
start
chalky
throughout
has
some
characteristics
similar
to
espresso
minus
the
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
memorable
either
the
aroma
is
stellar
but
all
other
facets
are
average
or
only
slightly
better
overall
a
spot
on
and
knock
out
of
the
park
milk
stout
the
creamy
sweetness
is
showcased
nicely
in
this
brew
and
the
espresso
bean
and
roasted
malts

nice
supporting
cast
nice

attendant

it

designation
here
the
emerald
city
may
lay
claim
to
a
metric
shit
ton
of
the
two
main
players
here
and
in
so
doing
has
engendered
an
affable
meeting
of
worlds
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
about
two
fingers
of
mocha
head
nice
aroma
of
fresh
coffee
and
a
slight
sweet
essence
taste
is
a
balance
of
fresh
coffee
with
chocolate
and
a
light
sweetness
this
is
not
an
overpowering
coffee
stout
was
slightly
disappointed
in
feel
as
it
comes
in
thinner
than
expected
and
very
carbonated
overall
a
solid
drink
if
you
enjoy
a
coffee
stout
that
wont
be
heavy
handed
recommended
nice
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
a
good
while
awesome
espresso
smell
starts
off
kind
of
sweet
and
finishes
just
like
the
nose
with
a
big
espresso
flavor
feels
pretty
watery
and
thats
gotta
be
the
only
thing
id
hold
against
this
beer
this
is
an
excellent
espresso
milk
stout
the
quality
of
the
coffee
flavor
in
this
beer
is
second
to
none
very
drinkable
with
a
strong
flavor
profile
nice
hit
of
coffee
upfront
that
then
mingles
with
the
sweetish
roast
of
the
finish
very
impressive
and
delicious
especially
considering
that
this
is
much
lower
abv
than
most
coffee
stouts
these
days
i
dont
miss
the
higher
gravity
at
all
bravo
elysian
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
sessionable
millksweet
stout
she
does
everything
that
elysian
wanted
good
job
guys
light
bodied
big
espresso
notes
great
smell
crazy
drinkable
well
done
well
worth
a
try
nice
amount
of
coffee
which
balances
the
milk
stout
sweetness
and
good
body
for
the
moderate
abv
thumbs
up
delicious
taste
and
finish
like
drinking
a
smooth
espresso
overall
no
joke
this
tastes
quite
reminiscent
of
a
quadshot
mocha
complete
with
whipped
cream
topping
from
your
local
coffee
shop
while
not
nearly
that
sweet
its
still
very
rich
and
decadent
tasting
almost
to
a
fault
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
that
being
said
i
would
think
this
is
practically
spot
in
for
the
style
a
pretty
damn
impressive
beer
overall
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
possibly
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
tried
excellent
all
around
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
overall
a
very
tasty
beer

invites
a
session
but
it
may
weigh
a
bit
heavy
lacing
is
an
entertainment
unto
itself
always
a
sign
imo
of
a
well
made
brew
o
a
very
solid
low
abv
stout
at
the
risk
of
sounding
redundant
this
offering
fell
short
of
expectations
lovely
creamy
carbonation
feels
a
little
watery
though
overall
a
beer
that
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
name
with
a
name
like
espresso
i
expect
overpowering
bitter
coffee
grounds
on
the
smell
and
taste
and
part
of
the
problem
is
that
there
are
so
many
really
good
coffee
stouts
out
there
these
days
that
this
one
even
though
its
far
from
a
poor
beer
it
just
doesnt
move
the
needle
in
relation
to
its
comparables
dark
brown
pour
milky
espresso
flavor
mixed
with
bakers
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
retention
is
decent
body
is
a
bit
thin
though
it
does
have
a
nice
bitter
coffee
finish
this
is
my
2nd
time
having
this
beer
smells
like
a
stout
tastes
like
a
big
beautiful
beer
latte
excellent
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
really
smooth
this
is
now
officially
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
ooverall
a
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
that
i
would
get
again
not
sure
how
this
one
ended
in
my
fridge
but
for
some
reason
a
stout
was
sounding
good
already
drank
a
belgian
bomber
so
not
sure
if
that
will
affect
my
review
of
this
one
outstanding
looking
beer
with
a
good
treat
to
the
nose
although
coffee
is
the
most
prominent
smell
taste
really
smooth
with
strong
coffee
taste
but
nothing
overwhelming
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
reasonably
easy
to
drink
but
with
the
low
abv
i
expected
more
i
actually
dinged
it
overall
due
to
low
abv
to
much
coffee
for
that
abv
in
my
opinion
while
it
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
be
not
probably
revisit
although
if
you
were
a
stout
and
especially
a
coffee
stout
fan
then
this
may
interest
you
o
overall
the
espresso
nature
starts
to
pick
up
with
some
rich
deep
coffee
grounds
balanced
by
some
minor
sweet
milk
chocoalte
notes
not
as
sweet
per
style
as
many
but
the
extra
rich
espresso
nature
picks
up
for
some
of
the
slack
making
this
somewhat
interesting
pours

feel

clean
with
an

there
is
also

hint
of

hint
of

hint
of

slight

and
a

overall
weak

but
good
aroma
body
blend
and
complexity
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
nice
aroma
and
tasty
for
such
low
abv
i
shouldve
drank
this
in
the
morning
if
youre
a
fan
of
coffee
stouts
or
prefer
the
taste
of
coffee
rather
than
beer
this
is
right
up
your
alley
i
thought
this
was
better
than
the
lagunitas
cappuccino
stout
i
had
a
couple
days
ago
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
will
seek
out
another
when
i
want
a
beer
for
breakfast
overall
a
really
nice
straightforward
coffee
stout
enjoyable
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
milk
stout
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
philly
stake
sandwich
on
a
spectacular
spring
day
by
the
canal
o
i
fear
i
may
be
slightly
ruined
regarding
nonimperial
stouts
unfortunately
this
tasted
and
felt
washed
out
to
me
but
that
may
not
be
the
beers
fault
in
an
effort
to
rate
to
style
i
rated
25
higher
than
i
was
originally
inclined
on
most
categories
poured
from
a
22
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
appears
very
dark
with
little
transparency
and
has
a
big
light
brown
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
it
has
a
nice
espresso
smell
with
a
hoppiness
its
a
nice
split
shot
between
fresh
hops
and
your
morning
espresso
very
nice
it
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
good
choice
for
breakfast
or
brunch
o
if
you
do
not
like
coffee
this
should
be
avoided
it
is
very
coffee
forward
and
coffee
in
the
mid
and
late
it
is
coffee
everywhere
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
like
that
elysian
just
said
ah
screw
it
lets
not
nibble
around
the
edges
lets
just
make
coffee
with
some
stout
in
there
i
like
this
and
will
drink
it
again
i
am
excited
to
suggest
it
to
a
few
friends
that
are
coffee
drinkers
grabbed
this
stout
at
fatheads
saloon
i
enjoyed
this
stout
a
nice
dark
brownblack
appearance
with
a
sweet
smell
tasted
great
i
could
really
taste
the
espresso
it
wasnt
super
overpowering
which
made
it
great
it
was
light
for
a
stout
but
still
tasted
good
good
coffee
stout
but
not
great
when
i
first
tasted
split
shot
i
thought
now
heres
a
brew
for
the
espresso
lover
it
is
a
perfect
dessert
stout
delicious
served
by
itself
or
with
just
about
any
sweet
treat
particularly
chocolate
it
is
the
ideal
post
prandial
brew
not
a
bit
of
bitterness
just
rich
creamy
silky
smooth
eminently
quaffable
but
why
hurry
this
is
a
brew
to
be
sipped
and
savored
until
the
very
last
drop
in
the
future
split
shot
will
be
my
brew
of
choice
following
a
meal
and
am
looking
forward
to
making
ice
cream
floats
with
it
in
the
summer
overall
delicious
one
of
those
coffee
beers
that
is
excellent
at
imitating
coffee
and
the
lactose
helps
add
some
body
and
sweetness
love
it
a
limited
run
brew
and
my
first
experience
with
elysian
a
new
favorite
while
it
lasts
never
did
this
feel
strong
and
had
there
been
more
here
i
would
have
easily
downed
another
in
one
sitting
most
beers
of
this
style
are
sweet
but
this
leaned
more
towards
the
smooth
and
dark
attributes
that
the
coffee
brought
out
in
it
fine
just
by
itself
as
a
dessert
beer
this
would
be
worth
seeking
out
due
to
its
limited
release
judge
this
beer
by
its
bottle
it
has
a
beauty
and
nuance
on
the
inside
that
matches
its
artful
appearance
on
the
outside
wonderfully
smooth
stuff
this
was
a
nice
beer
a
little
less
rich
than
i
expected
from
the
taste
price
point

oz
single
a
very
enjoyable
coffee
breakfast
themed
milk
stout
overall
outstanding
beer
that
id
love
to
have
again
this
is
amazing
this
brewery
keeps
on
surprising
me
overall
a
a
decent
milk
stout
it
could
be
a
little
creamier
but
its
good
its
also
better
warmer
we
done
guys
great
use
of
coffee
here
with
a
near
perfect
balance
o
pretty
simple
but
quite
delicious
like
a
carbonated
iced
mocha
only
real
detraction
is
the
sudden
and
sharp
dryness
of
the
aftertaste
still
tasty
o
not
a
bad
beer
first
time
i
ever
tried
it
a
nice
balance
throughout
and
nice
warming
effect
as
well
somewhat
filling
this
stuff
is
great
a
sessionable
milk
stout
with
a
bit
of
coffee
subtle
on
that
front
easy
drinking
and
delicious
dark
brown
pour
with
some
viscosity
and
about
an
inch
of
head
close
to
white
that
sticks
around
pretty
well
the
nose
is
more
of
the
lactose
sugar
than
the
espresso
but
i
get
the
classic
bitterness
from
the
coffee
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
stout
the
grain
is
fresh
and
well
roasted
not
super
dark
with
some
chocolate
notes
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
the
coffee
is
up
front
in
the
taste
not
dominant
at
all
but
just
an
accent
similarly
i
dont
get
much
caffeine
from
this
which
aids
drinkability
for
me
the
back
end
is
the
milk
stout
part
the
lactose
sugar
gives
sweetness
and
body
to
an
already
rich
feeling
drink
with
excellent
carbonation
this
is
very
satisfying
elysian
makes
some
great
pumpkin
beer
and
now
its
nice
to
see
some
of
their
other
stuff
on
the
market
here
in
denver
this
is
very
good
milk
stout
worth
a
try
if
you
like
milk
stouts
and
coffee
beers
lots
going
on
and
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
an
impressive
beer
delivering
exactly
what
it
says
it
does
i
actually
found
myself
trying
to
taste
this
beer
in
different
ways
from
chewing
to
popping
a
quick
shot
everytime
fitting
some
new
level
of
flavor
espresso
its
there
milk
stout
absolutely
this
beer
followed
up
in
that
exact
order
too
with
impressive
notes
of
coffee
and
a
creamy
finish
you
would
think
this
beer
was
made
by
starbucks
themselves
what
a
great
brew

overall
a
very
good
stout
not
too
dry
and
not
too
overpowering
in
one
elementcoffee
or
creamy
comes
off
as
well
balanced
between
the
two
o
a
solid
coffee
stout
while
it
isnt
the
most
exciting
its
still
a
nicely
balanced
example
of
the
style
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
and
even
buy
it
again
d
a

with
plenty
but
not
too
much
espresso
and
milk
id
prefer
a
full
on

stout
like
left

or
nitro
overall
this
beer
is
really
really
working
for
me
its
got
the
right
balance
and
it
really
goes
down
easy
kudos
to
the
brewers
bomber
into
traditional
english
stout
glass
perfect
color
decent
head
and
left
some
decorative

aroma
was
a

taste
was
perfectly
balanced
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
not
overpowering
medium
viscosity
wonderful
aftertaste
this
is
one
rock
solid
sweet
stout
im
sure
if
i
was
an
espresso
drinker
i
would
appreciate
it
even
further
good
stuff
the
taste
has
that
lactose
sweet
creaminess
with
a
nice
caramel
tinge
coming
in
as
the
espresso
trails
behind
with
slight
roasted
flavors
more
bean
than
malt
but
mild
in
bitterness
and
is
really
smooth
i
think
they
have
made
a
practically
nearperfect
subtle
espresso
flavored
milk
stout
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
and
if
there
were
any
more
espresso
it
might
disrupt
the
balance
which
i
think
is
what
makes
this
so
drinkable
really
hitting
the
spot
o
a
decent
coffeeforward
stout
for
sure
with
a
light
body
and
good
coffeeroasted
bean
flavors
would
have
loved
to
seen
the
milk
sugars
shine
more
but
its
tough
to
share
the
adjunct
spotlight
with
coffee
im
sure
overall
pretty
much
a
good
and
solid
milk
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
might
pick
this
up
again
i
generally
like
my
stouts
to
be
a
bit
heavier
but
i
can
make
an
exception
for
a
solid
and
very
accessible
example
overall
an
above
average
milk
stout
i
like
the
roasted
flavor
the
coffee
brings
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
as
its
rich
without
being
heavy
and
it
isnt
too
high
in
terms
of
abv
dont
hesitate
to
give
it
a
try
o
super
solid
coffee
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
espresso
chocolate
and
lactose
o
killer
espresso
stout
with
a
different
twist
of
being
a
milk
stout
elysian
does
it
again
with
another
surprise
and
another
dynamite
brew
prost
poured
into
a
schooner
from
a
12
oz
bottle
a
thick
cafe
colored
head
that
sustained
throughout
with
layered
lacing
smells
like
a
late
tastes
like
a
spicedburnt
late
very
good
and
great
example
of
the
style
could
use
more
heat
from
more
alcohol
overall
perhaps
a
year
in
the
bottle
did
not
serve
this
well
but
the
beer
is
not
particularly
impressive
the
body
doesnt
hold
up
and
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
underattenuated
o
an
enjoyable
coffee
stout
overall
especially
for
the
low
abv
robust
and
with
a
lot
of
nice
coffee
notes
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
tasty
o
this
could
be
an
excellent
brew
if
the
mouthfeel
offered
a
richer
experience
on
par
with
the
scent
and
the
taste
overall
still
enjoyable
and
might
still
reach
for
it
with
my
eggs
benny
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
great
potential
but
it
is
mostly
squandered
the
aroma
and
taste
match
up
well
but
are
too
simplistic
to
really
make
for
a
great
beer
this
beer
is
merely
good
before
factoring
in
the
mouthfeel
it
ends
up
just
being
a
typical
average
stout
in
the
end

lampertland
overall
a
pretty
tasty
stout
with
it
not
being
too
heavy
it
having
a
creamier
feel
and
nice
sweeter
finish
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
to
sip
after
a
meal
a
good
not
great
coffee
stout
the
coffee
and
milk
stout
flavors
are
fairly
well
balanced
but
the
dry
sour
aftertaste
keeps
it
a
one
and
done
bottle
not
something
id
want
to
session
it
did
have
a
nice
smoothness
and
a
pleasing
sweetness
so
i
do
think
elysian
has
some
great
stout
making
abilities
but
marrying
it
pleasingly
with
coffee
didnt
work
out
too
well
with
this
one
pours
black
with
brown
highlights
and
a
good
helping
of
tanbrown
head
good
retention
aroma
is
big
on
coffee
i
think
mostly
from
the
coffee
but
also
complemented
by
the
dark
roast
malt
quite
a
bit
of
lactose
in
the
nose
as
well
and
a
small
helping
of
hop
taste
follows
with
big
coffee
and
dark
roasts
sweetness
there
too
though
and
a
balancing
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
bitter
both
coffee
and
hop
i
suspect
overall
a
great
beer
my
first
milk
stout
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
lactose
and
cream
with
some
coffee
notes
the
flavor
is
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
some
lactose
thrown
in
i
also
get
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
bit
more
of
a
sweeter
coffee
beer
which
was
good
but
not
the
best
ive
had
for
sure
overall
great
coffee
stout
smoothe
drinker
i
like
stouts
that
dont
use
a
lot
of
black
patent
this
is
a
good
one
coffee
tones
are
just
right
overall
coffee
taste
was
okay
but
the
beer
wasnt
big
enough
to
back
it
up
o
this
is
as
advertised
a
sweet
stout
with
a
big
coffee
overload
very
robust
and
sweet
flavor
even
with
the
big
coffee
flavor
and
bitterness
the
sweetness
still
seems
to
dominant
more
reminiscent
of
a
mocha
with
tons
of
milk
or
cream
with
whipped
cream
on
top
lots
of
great
flavors
and
little
over
the
top
definitely
worth
seeking
out
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
robust
deeply
roasted
coffee
flavor
thats
countered
by
sweeter
malts
not
acrid
or
overly
roasted
with
subtle
smokiness
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
oatmeal
this
is
countered
by
lighter
chocolate
toffee
and
hazelnut
as
well
as
some
lactic
cream
still
a
heavy
coffee
flavor
but
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
overall
i
loved
the
smell
of
this
beer
its
not
super
complex
but
elysian
definately
made
what
they
set
out
to
do
great
beer
suprised
it
does
not
get
more
love
from
people
who
review
it
been
interested
in
this
one
pours
a
nice
black
coffee
with
a
bit
of
light
mocha
foam
and
no
lace
smells
of
coffee
and
hints
of
lactose
sweetness
the
coffee
is
bold
and
almost
spicy
with
hints
of
soil
and
tobacco
nice
nose
flavor
comes
through
delivering
quite
a
bit
of
lactose
sweetness
actually
so
much
it
reminds
me
of
nondairy
creamer
cocoa
bitterness
coffee
smooth
roastyness
i
like
the
flavor
but
i
can
see
how
some
would
perceive
it
to
taste
cheap
full
bodied
with
a
reserved
carbonation
and
wet
finish
overall
decent
beer
and
something
really
approachable
for
all
but
i
wouldnt
buy
more
than
a
couple
times
a
year
if
always
around
o
overall
this
is
exactly
as
it
sounds
and
a
pretty
good
beer
the
nose
and
taste
have
a
lot
of
espresso
and
sweet
milkcream
and
chocolate
as
opposed
to
more
of
a
coffee
grind
flavor
that
some
coffee
stouts
have
very
good
nose
and
taste
though
the
mouthfeel
is
too
think
and
not
carbonated
enough
worth
checking
out
and
would
have
it
again
3
0
d
normally
id
give
this
a
3
5
but
the
nose
was
borderline
and
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
dark
chalky
black
thin
cap
of
khaki
head
scent
brings
dark
roasted
espresso
bean
cream
and
sugar
light
notes
of
nuttyness
tatste
strong
with
roasted
bean
and
freshly
brewed
dark
coffee
good
sugar
and
cream
notes
finishes
with
a
strong
peanut
buttery
note
fuller
side
of
medium
smooth
with
some
graniness
solid
milk
stout
all
around
more
like
a
dry
stout
fresh
on
tap
at
coles
licorice
and
roast
aromas
off
notes
like
moldwhich
is
likely
the
lactose
milk
part
that
sometimes
emits
this
more
like
goat
cheese
and
coffee
unhappily
married
dry
finish
above
average
mouthfeel
though
oily
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
if
you
are
like
me
and
love
coffee
then
you
will
like
this
beer
however
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
more
beer
like
avoid
this
as
the
coffee
dominates
this
beer
to
an
extreme
degree
its
almost
more
like
drinking
iced
coffee
then
a
beer
the
body
was
average
for
a
milk
stout
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
will
obviously
depend
on
your
taste
for
coffee
if
you
love
the
stuff
you
will
love
this
beer
overall
you
could
get
one
of
these
instead
of
an
iced
coffee
at
starbucks
and
be
just
as
satisfied
i
dont
mind
roasted
notes
in
beer
and
if
there
is
a
hint
of
coffee
to
complement
the
the
malts
and
grain
in
a
beer
thats
acceptable
but
when
the
adjunct
in
a
beer
so
completely
overpowers
the
basic
beeriness
of
a
beer
that
beer
has
gone
off
the
rails
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
to
the
noncoffee
lover
overall
a
nice
coffee
stout
and
a
nice
choice
for
sbw
on
tap
at
elysian
fields
in
seattle

with

from

that
melds

medium
mouthfeel
and
goes

one
of
the
best
i
have
had
of
the
styledid
this
not
turn
out
as
well
in
the
bottle
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
reddish
brown
thin
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
are
not

flavor
is
similar
tastes
like
a

shake
faint
toasted

light
toasted

and
sharp
lightly

coffee
finish
very
smooth
and
integrated
a
nice

coffee
stout
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
nice
creaminess
o
coffee
and
more
coffee
a
good
choice
as
any
for
seattle
beer
week
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
dry
a
little
gritty
overall
this
is
good
but
not
great
overall
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
coffee
beers
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
beer
to
represent
seattle
beer
week
o
really
enjoyable
this
beer
could
be
huge
as
an
imperial
stout
but
nonetheless
the
milk
stout
approach
with
the
lower
abv
was
nice
sweet
milky
body
with
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
complexity
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
2012
seattle
beer
week
will
certainly
be
a
memorable
one
good
milk
stout
but
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
not
bad
at
all
though
feel
light
and
creamy
smell
was
good
lots
of
roast
flavoring
and
some
charredness
the
afterteaste
was
very
unsettleing
i
was
suprised
how
much
bitterness
came
out
of
this
stout
and
which
caused
a
unpleasant
taste
the
feel
was
of
a
waterd
down
stout
with
a
sweet
creamer
blended
in
with
it
i
am
in
disbelief
of
what
i
tasted
from
what
i
smelled
and
how
nicely
it
poured
many
people
seem
to
like
this
so
grab
a
6
pack
and
try
it
for
yourself
overall
this
is
a
decent
milk
stout
possessing
good
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
accented
with
some
caramellike
sweetness
however
theres
a
little
too
much
coffeelike
bitterness
for
my
taste
fans
of
that
kind
of
bitterness
should
like
it
though
o
poured
into
a
stout
glass
but
i
think
i
served
it
a
bit
too
cold
so
i
let
it
sit
a
few
minutes
before
continuing
to
drink
and
reevaluated
overall
a
barely
above
average
milk
stout
must
try
o
a
pretty
good
solid
stout
not
getting
much
obvious
sweet
or
smooth
effect
from
any
added
lactose
however
but
the
nine
months
on
this
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
the
only
negatives
that
prevent
it
from
having
a
higher
score
is
that
it
is
a
bit
watery
in
its
taste
and
it
is
a
bit
sweet
if
you
dont
like
a
sweet
tasting
beer
you
might
want
to
stay
away
from
this
one
i
dont
mind
the
sweet
taste
but
it
could
be
dialed
down
just
a
smidgen
overallnot
somthing
i
would
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
not
an
outstanding
beer
in
my
mind
a
sweet
smelling
dark
stout
the
smooth
creamy
taste
of
a
stout
made
with
milk
sugars
this
is
a
good
one
it
pours
dark
with
a
brown
creamy
head
the
smell
is
very
sweet
like
chocolate
milk
the
taste
is
where
it
gets
you
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
sweet
yet
dry
and
has
the
undertones
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
this
beer
is
exceptional
to
me
my
favorite
milk
stout
and
also
the
first
ive
had
havent
had
any
others
compare
as
of
yet
overall
4
i
found
the
initial
taste
very
uninspiring
but
it
faded
into
an
enjoyable
roasted
malt
character
the
only
thing
i
will
complain
about
is
the
light
body
i
think
its
solid
as
a
regular
or
sweet
stout
but
lacks
as
a
milk
stout
its
tasty
nonetheless
lancaster
location
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
milk
stout
that
still
has
that
nice
roasted
malt
finish
look
no
further
this
and
left
handed
are
at
the
top
of
the
heap
when
it
comes
to
a
smooth
drinking
milk
stout
o
very
well
brewed
and
highly
recommended
in
one
word
melo
taste
palate
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
mellow
toasded
and
roasted
maltiness
it
has
a
nice
molasses
like
sweetness
and
equally
balanced
bitterness
its
palate
is
a
light
medium
and
very
drinkable
o
for
a
milksweet
stout
this
is
not
quite
right
due
to
the
relative
bitterness
and
lack
of
lactose
if
i
take
the
gestalt
its
actually
an
enjoyable
stout
it
must
be
the
fact
that
this
is
english
style
and
presumably
relying
more
on
the
malts
rather
than
the
lactose
to
provide
sweetness
but
this
has
a
lot
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
overall
if
this
were
labeled
as
simply
stout

finger
licking
good
this
was
my
first
milk
stout
and
i
cant
say
i
cared
for
it
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
itpitch
black
with
a
full
finger
of
beige
head
as
soon
as
i
smelled
this
beer
i
knew
i
wasnt
going
to
like
it
smells
extremely
cloyingly
sweet
and
vaguely
milklikenot
like
actual
milk
but
more
like
the
condense
powder
smells
taste
could
only
be
described
as
sour
milk
way
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
an
offputting
puckering
feeling
in
the
middle
and
absolutely
no
bitterness
or
roasted
malts
this
just
tastely
entirely
unbalanced
and
not
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
was
also
a
little
off
with
the
bodied
being
on
the
mediumthin
side
and
the
level
of
carbonation
being
too
low
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
beer
and
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
one
again
dn
im
really
happy
with
this
beer
i
thought
that
it
might
taste
like
milk
forgive
my
noobishness
so
it
is
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
appearance
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
redeems
this
brewery
after
the
strawberry
wheat
experience
shudder
recommended
deep
dark
mahogany
in
a
color
with
a
massive
craterous
light
brown
head
smelled
of
roasted
malts
spice
and
sweet
chocolate
smelled
was
as
expected
but
man
the
taste
wasnt
it
was
damn
near
undrinkable
for
me
started
spicy
with
some
burnt
malt
flavors
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
extremely
sour
tasting
to
the
point
of
questioning
whether
or
not
something
was
wrong
with
the
bottle
i
had
just
horrible
mouth
was
medium
and
not
at
all
full
and
smooth
like
a
stout
should
be
it
was
more
watery
and
acidic
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
until
i
have
one
that
tastes
otherwise
this
review
will
stand
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
roasty
and
creamy
this
is
a
satisfying
brew
a
very
good
beer
i
looked
forward
to
that
silky
sweet
finish
at
every
sip
ill
have
this
one
again
pours
a
rich
dark
color
almost
black
with
shades
of
crimson
the
head
is
about
just
right
in
size
and
is
a
nice
light
brown
full
bodied
and
rich
with
late
hints
of
coffee
and
choclate
a
bit
sweet
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
but
that
is
a
product
of
the
lactose
and
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
not
a
beer
that
you
would
want
to
drink
four
or
five
at
a
sitting
but
it
is
not
too
sweet
to
have
two
12
ounce
bottle
with
just
a
smidge
less
bittering
and
a
bit
less
smoky
flavors
this
would
be
a
beer
that
would
set
the
bar
very
high
pours
a
simple
black
with
a
small
tan
head
heads
gone
within
seconds
and
leaves
no
sign
of
lacing
smells
very
malty
with
loads
of
coffee
undertones
a
ncie
sweet
smell
is
present
also
tastes
very
intersting
with
toffe
and
chocolate
notes
abounding
has
a
unique
taste
and
an
exellent
one
at
that
now
where
this
beer
lacks
the
mouthfeel
its
slimy
and
watery
theres
no
chew
or
stick
to
it
and
no
aftertaste
other
than
that
this
is
a
fine
beer
if
you
can
get
over
the
watery
mouthfeel
tasty
tasty
stuff
much
moreso
than
i
expected
it
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
nice
pillowy
tan
head
which
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
nice
residue
on
the
glass
as
well
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
coffee
with
malt
and
maybe
some
caramel
present
as
well
the
flavour
is
just
spot
on
the
coffee
notes
are
just
subtle
enought
for
my
liking
and
the
sweetness
is
effective
but
not
overpowering
there
is
some
burnt
malt
flavour
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
scattered
thoughout
as
well
the
finish
is
earthy
and
surprisingly
dry
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
and
seemed
to
me
to
fall
between
a
stout
and
porter
in
terms
of
body
which
is
right
where
i
feel
it
should
be
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
again
and
often
oelergud
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
unquie
beer
to
me
at
least
with
the
picture
of
a
cow
on
the
label
you
get
the
taste
of
milk
as
if
the
put
some
in
the
stout
they
might
have
i
know
homebrewers
who
do
crazier
things
the
darkness
of
this
beer
is
a
beauty
but
it
offers
little
head
but
it
might
off
a
tap
on
with
nitrogen
the
roasted
taste
is
followed
imediately
with
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
sour
notes
it
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
sour
milk
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
does
taste
like
soured
milk
only
in
the
after
taste
is
it
lingering
but
not
strongly
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
and
could
drink
a
few

i

it
was
tailgating
at
one
of
the

someone
saw
my
beer
goodness
and
asked
for
a
taste
then
wanted
to
offer
up
a
replacement
i
said
none
needed
but
he
pulled
out
one
of
these
which
i
had
not
tasted
yet
kinda
cool
a
bad
sample
i
dont
think
so
because
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
the

and
its
not
outright
rancid
still
an
unpleasant
beer
im
a

fan
of

im
always
eager
to
try
other
milk
stouts
ill
buy
another

of
this

give
it
a

based
on
this

id
advise

theres

yet
nothing
outstanding
about
this
offering
from
lancaster
its
an
easydrinker
and
makes
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
this
appeared
with
a
standard
black
body
and
a
small
light
brown
head
that
didnt
leave
much
lace
about
the
glass
aroma
was
off
a
roasted
malt
and
cream
with
an
off
sour
scent
to
it
as
well
the
taste
had
that
same
old
sourness
to
it
as
well
which
i
didnt
remember
from
the
first
time
i
sampled
this
other
flavors
were
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
was
standard
with
about
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
what
ever
was
going
on
which
the
sour
characteristics
hurts
the
drinkability
a
lot
i
had
2
separate
bottles
and
both
tasted
the
same
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
in
the
future
and
see
if
that
has
changed
beer
is
good
happy
local
roasty
beering
the
hard
lactic
acid
with
the
cask
conditioning
made
it
hard
going
down
i
rated
the
drinkability
higher
since
ive
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
when
it
is
better
perfectly
opaque
black
body
with
a
volumnious
tan
head
disappearing
quickly
into
a
thin
layer
smells
mostly
of
alcohol
and
a
slight
sweet
coffee
very
thin
body
with
slight
citruslike
acidity
mixed
with
definite
sweetness
of
toasted
malt
slowly
develops
into
a
faint
chocolate
aftertaste
easy
going
down
smooth
and
thin
extremely
drinkable
would
work
well
after
a
meal
and
as
a
summer
stout
flavors
get
better
as
it
warms
pours
out
a
nice
bold
brownish
black
with
a
small
taan
head
tastes
of
malts
sweet
and
toasty
flavor
is
quite
interesting
sweetens
up
as
the
brew
warms
mouthfeel
is
solid
in
the
bottled
form
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
could
be
better
in
other
forms
a
very
drinkable
stout
in
the
summer
im
glad
to
see
milk
stout
is
still
being
produced
in
this
country
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
sample
a
nice
dark
beer
that
arrived
with
a
decent
tan
head
which
retained
well
there
is
a
definite
coffee
scent
present
of
a
nature
that
put
me
in
mind
of
coffee
ice
cream
the
nitrogen
pour
results
in
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
the
finish
reinforced
my
initial
thoughts
of
coffee
ice
cream
this
is
definitely
a
sweet
stout
i
could
see
this
as
an
accompaniment
to
to
a
dish
of
vanilla
ice
cream
and
it
is
highly
recommended
with
strawberry
wheat
as
a
chocolatecovered
strawberry
great
alternative
to
guinness
taste
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
tip
with
a
nic
e
malty
flavor
solidly
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
lighter
than
you
would
think
feel
drinkability
is
endless
one
of
the
finer
stouts
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
this
is
one
helluva
a
milk
stout
i
highly
recommend
allowing
the
beer
to
warm
up
for
a
bit
and
allow
the
malt
complexities
to
pull
through
lovely
stuff
smooth
but
very
thin
on
the
tongue
overly
sweet
lacking
the
complexity
of
other
milks
ive
had
good
but
underwhelming
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
dark
malt
smell
with
a
creamy
yet
dry
aroma
the
lactose
added
lends
an
extra
amount
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dark
feel
to
it
with
a
sweet
finish
it
boasts
of
black
patent
malts
and
a
creamy
lactose
content
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
it
has
a
niche
here
which
adds
to
the
attractiveness
this
is
a
good
drinker
though
it
does
not
replace
any
of
the
irish
stouts
that
i
prefer
lms
is
tasty
with
an
excellent
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
less
bloating
than
most
chocolate
stouts
i
recommend
it
highly
overall
a
decent
stout
that
makes
a
nice
sipping
beer
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
but
not
bad
this
is
my
first
try
at
a
milk
stout
but
it
isnt
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
at
all
the
color
is
a
blackish
stout
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissapates
quickly
there
is
almost
no
lacing
to
speak
of
i
dont
get
much
smell
from
it
other
than
the
usual
roasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
somewhat
sickly
sweetness
on
the
back
end
this
is
very
thin
almost
watery
in
the
mouth
i
tried
a
second
to
be
fair
to
the
beer
but
this
would
never
be
a
favorite
of
mine
i
sampled
this
one
over
the
weekend
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
a
milky
scent
can
be
detected
the
taste
is
sweet
and
creamy
this
is
definitely
a
milk
stout
this
is
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
stout
category
very
little
bitterness
and
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
really
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
alcohol
is
not
too
high
and
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
stout
that
provides
an
excellent
change
of
pace
from
all
of
the
big
overpoweringly
flavorful
stouts
that
i
am
used
to
pours
deep
brown
almost
black
with
garnet
hues
that
show
when
held
up
to
the
light
creamy
cappuccino
colored
head
has
staying
power
and
leaves
behind
nice
lace
aroma
of
light
and
sweet
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
greet
the
nose
flavors
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
smooth
the
way
for
a
roastedbitter
and
dry
ending
medium
in
body
and
velvety
smooth
this
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
overly
rich
delicious
and
highly
enjoyable
drinkability
was
very
high
nice
stout
thanks
to
my
buddy
beerluvr
for
this
great
sample
thanks
to
sir
pissky
of
the
nights
of
the
good
beer
table
for
this
one
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
as
the
flavors
are
nice
even
though
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
its
nice
to
know
that
this
brand
is
the
newest
into
nj
and
that
its
here
for
the
long
haul
good
milk
stout
and
good
pale
drinkability
again
i
like
stouts
so
i
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
not
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
afternoon
its
too
heavy
you
can
definitley
drink
two
to
three
at
a
seating
thick
brownish
tan
head
in
the
glass
very
longlasting
very
dark
brownreddish
liquid
nose
is
chocolatey
coffeeish
nutty
and
slightly
leathery
all
in

of
sweet
smelling
maltiness
tasting
reveals
rich
malty
mouthfeel
with
notes
of
milk
chocolate
weak
coffee
and
a
little
smokiness
finishes
roastydry
with
some
hoppiness
and
slight
tanginess
delicious
this
brew
pours
very
dark
almost
black
an
aggressive
pour
generated
a
frothy
tan
head
that
faded
back
to
swirling
weather
pattern
masking
the
beer
it
had
a
very
light
bouquet
and
smelled
a
bit
bland
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
were
consisitant
through
out
the
after
taste
was
bitter
dry
and
lingered
for
quite
awhile
i
expected
a
milk
stout
to
be
creamy
but
this
one
was
a
little
thin
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
type
of
stout
it
didnt
effect
the
beer
if
true
the
taste
was
smooth
and
creamy
i
drank
right
from
the
bottle
this
beer
quenched
my
thirst
for
a
stout
and
left
plenty
of
room
for
more
too
many
stouts
leave
me
full
and
not
wanting
to
drink
much
more
this
creamy
taste
and
coffee
flavored
brew
was
a
delight
to
my
senses
i
will
further
taste
this
delightful
brew
in
a
glass
and
on
tap
wish
me
happy
hunting
this
is
a
very
smooth
brew
and
i
will
be
buying
more
of
it
next
time
i
am
in
pa
poured
black
with
a
tint
of
ruby
red
at
the
edges
seemed
thin
on
the
pour
and
left
a
very
small
tan
head
aroma
is
a
smoky
roasted
malt
with
coffee
notes
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
nothing
outstanding
and
could
use
more
flavor
in
my
opinion
not
bad
though
overall
dark
ruby
appearance
small
creamy
brown
head
retention
is
minimal
and
lacing
is
negligent
aroma
is
quite
nice
espresso
cocoa
milk
sugar
vanilla
bean
good
stuff
the
flavors
follow
suit
nicely
good
bittersweet
chocolate
thing
going
on
coffee
bean
lactic
sugars
dry
cocoa
this
is
tasty
stuff
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
body
a
little
better
than
medium
if
this
were
available
around
here
ive
got
a
feeling
id
be
drinking
it
regularly
this
beer
is
a
magic
carpet
ride
either
due
to
my
perfect
pour
or
solid
brewing
my
pint
looks
fantastic
nice
12
inch
of
foam
on
a
very
mucky
black
hints
of
espresso
toasted
malt
and
nut
in
the
nose
the
first
sip
yields
that
a
strong
espresso
taste
with
lingering
hints
of
cream
on
my
second
swig
i
know
why
this
is
a
milk
stout
milk
coats
the
back
of
my
mouth
im
quite
impressed
by
the
balance
of
beer
this
is
my
first
of
the
sub
style
and
i
was
a
little
hesitant
as
i
continue
drinking
i
notice
the
great
lacing
that
surrounds
my
glass
well
done
the
beer
has
a
slight
sweet
taste
reminding
me
of
the
cream
ale
i
had
last
night
but
this
sweetness
comes
from
a
very
subdued
chocolate
infusion
the
nutty
flavor
may
be
hazelnuts
two
words
well
balanced
next
time
im
in
philly
ill
be
looking
for
this
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
light
almond
colored
head
that
dissapates
pretty
quickaroma
is
of
french
roast
coffee
deeply
roasted
taste
is
incredably
coffeeish
with
a
slight
malted
milk
taste
i
like
the
intermingling
flavors
of
coffee
and
lactose
very
tasty
beer
i
will
get
again
if
given
the
chance
since
im
not
a
stout
fan
a
4
for
mouthfeel
and
3
5
drinkability
is
really
high
backwash
a
good
rendition
of
this
alltoorare
style
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
which
i
can
compare
this
but
it
isnt
up
to
the
benchmark
imported
mackesons
an
old
favorite
sadly
there
arent
enough
genuine
milk
stouts
around
anymore
so
it
is
wonderful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
with
a
bit
more
body
a
smoother
sweetness
and
finer
carbonation
lancaster
would
have
a
star
offering
as
it
is
it
is
a
good
but
not
great
stout
the
milk
stout
poured
a
dark
impenetrable
black
color
with
a
light
tan
creamy
head
the
head
shrunk
fairly
quickly
and
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
was
visible
the
luxurious
darkness
of
this
beer
made
the
appearance
very
pleasant
heavy
malt
tones
dominated
the
smell
with
lots
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
characteristics
the
taste
had
an
interesting
sweetness
and
a
smooth
creamy
texture
probably
due
to
the
lactose
a
nice
mild
coffee
aftertaste
with
a
smoked
features
lingered
for
a
while
mouthfeel
was
very
soft
and
a
bit
thin
but
did
not
detract
from
the
overall
quality
a
somewhat
mellow
stout
the
creamy
taste
and
feel
make
this
a
good
brew
and
a
nice
step
down
from
the
more
aggressive
stouts
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
smooth
and
nicely
creamy
flavors
of
mildly
bittersweet
chocolate
come
through
the
chocolate
flavors
are
not
as
dark
or
bitter
as
they
are
in
heartier
stouts
such
as
oatmeals
or
imperials
could
use
more
hops
but
then
again
thats
always
my
complaint
a
very
nicely
done
milk
stout
one
that
seems
very
true
to
the
style
thanks
jarod
ps
i
have
had
the
milkstout
in
bottles
as
well
not
as
perfect
as
on
tap
but
tasty
non
the
less
overall
most
milk
stouts
that
i
tried
in
the
uk
were
rather
simple
in
character
but
what
they
had
flavor
wise
they
used
to
great
effect
this
is
true
with
the
offering
from
lancaster
a
lovely
smooth
creamy
milk
stout
with
a
nice
lacticbitter
ending
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
the
sample
i
have
heard
many
good
things
about
lancaster
brewing
and
this
beer
so
i
saw
it
at
ds
and
figured
its
about
time
i
give
it
a
try
pours
a
very
deep
almond

a
fairly
thin
tan
head
on
top
of
the
body
leaves
a
nice
trickled
lace
down
the
glass
with
every
sip
the
aroma
are
soothing
tones
of
mild
chocolate
and
dark
roasts
creating
a
warming
sensation
like
taking
some
freshly
cracked
coffee
roasts
in
very
nice
and
mild
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
a
huskiness
there
in
the
finish
of
the
aroma
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
bitter
sweet
creamy
textured
tones
and
the
harsh
dark
roasts
that
leave
such
a
great
flavor
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
but
not
heavy
or
cloying
in
any
way
very
creamy
textured
mouthfeel
making
this
one
very
good
stout
i
could
sip
on
this
beer
when
in
the
mood
for
a
good
creamy
stout
i
like
the
cap
it
says
lancaster
brewing
better
beer
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
on
the
day
as
so
many
of
the
other
scores
seem
so
high
but
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
beer
perhaps
ill
have
to
give
it
another
try
if
i
go
out
towards
eastern
pa
in
the
future

it

fall
a

this
is
a
great
stout
i
could
see
it
as
a
starter
stout
for
someone
who
hasnt
really
gotten
into
the
dark
stuff
yet
pours
a
clear
very
deep
brown
almost
black
with
reddishmahogany
highlights
the
creamy
light
tan

holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lace

soft
roastiness
greet
the

the
body
is
medium
with
a
soft
veryfine
bubbled
carbonation
that
provides
the
expected
creamy
mouthfeel
and
helps
to
emphasise
the
malty
flavors
the
flavor
is
distinctly
chocolatey
and
caramelish
with
a
firm
roastiness
but
its
not
overly
rich
or
full
which
helps
to
give
it
a
good
drinkability
it
finishes
drying
with
a
short
lingering
note
of
sweet
chocolate
and

excellent

do
it

down

you
swallow
leaving

off

oatmeal
downplayed
to
the
point
where
i
have
to
ask
why
call
this
an
oatmeal
stout
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
lite
for
a
stout
and
goes
down
easy
after
a
long
day
at
work
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
its
a
decent
stout
for
sure
as
stouts
go
im
perhaps
spoiled
by
russian
imperial
stouts
this
stout
was
good
for
the
profile
but
overall
rather
ordinary
the
smell
was
sweet
but
the
first
taste
was
so
unlike
the
smell
that
it
was
initially
offputting
taste
improved
as
it
warmed
overall
not
bad
but
didnt
distinguish
itself
from
other
oatmeal
stouts
to
be
very
memorable
pours
very
dark
black
with
small
foam

nose
that
is
quite
prominent
dark
chocolate
too
rich

milk
back
touch
of
sweetness
at
the

that
blends
into
a

bitter
very
enjoyable
not
overly
lactosed
like
some
milk
stouts
can
be
overall
a
decent
beer
too
much
espresso
for
me
it
really
doesnt
mold
to
well
with
all
the
oatmeal
in
my
opinion
i
love
rover
horse
since
they
keep
making
interesting
beers
and
this
is
no
different
a
nice
deep
milk
stout
that
you
have
to
chew
i
love
them
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
all
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
coming
from
underneath
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
but
you
instantly
get
over
the
sweetness
and
find
the
cream
and
the
earthy
oatmeal
mingling
with
the
hops
and
malt
a
little
thin
but
the
flavors
are
so
good
that
i
thought
it
makes
a
good

but
with
a
hint
of
smoke
more
towards
dark
chocolate
than
milk
chocolate
on
that
note
let
us
address
their
untruth
in
advertising
the
milk
is
derived
from
their
use
of
lactose
sugar
in
the
brewing
process
and
the
oatmeal
is
used
to
cut
some
of
the
burnt
flavor
that
early
versions
took
from
the
extremely
roasted
malts
not
to
add
the
flavor
of
cookies
mouthfeel
was
big
thick
and
silky
and
the
taste
was
more
like
sweet
chocolate
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
so
apparently
their
use
of
oatmeal
worked
finish
was
more
towards
milk
chocolate
and
it
was
certainly
sweet
so
i
have
to
give
it
to
them
in
terms
of
style
i
just
wish
that
their
label
was
more
direct
and
less
misleading
good
tasting
milk
stout
dark
no
light
gets
through
the
glass
of
this
tasty
beer
lighter
and
a
bit
sweeter
than
other
milk
stouts
lower
abv
just
a
good
smooth
stout
good
grade
id
have
another
one
of
these
any
day
i
will
give
this
a
better
rating
than
left
hanss
version
good
head
and
lacing
too
o
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
like
the
combination
of
coffee
malt
tastes
and
the
sweetness
the
abv
is
not
high
so
i
drank
a
couple
glasses
i
will
buy
this
again
serving

12

from

joe

black
with

creamy
beige

is
of
bread
crust
burnt

brown

and
some

taste
is
of
prunes
burnt

brown

and
hint

finish
is
short
and
watery
boring
brew
cant
complain
about
this
one
drinks
solid
and
well
made
overall
pretty
solid
stout
nothing
too
special
about
this
but
its
good
drinking
a
fresh
one
so
im
gonna
let
the
rest
sit
for
a
while
so
the
flavors
can
mature
o
great
not
as
good
as
moo
hoo
but
its
up
there
this
has
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
and
more
coffee
thank
moo
hoo
but
its
great
none
the
less
this
is
a
very
dark
blackish
beer
with
a
tan
head
the
coffeelike
aroma
is
mixed
with
grain
distant
smoke
and
a
bit
of
dark
malt
smells
for
taste
this
beer
is
drier
than
i
expected
but
still
robust
with
a
firm
bitterness
and
some
grain
and
highly
roasted
malt
flavors
it
has
a
heavy
body
with
a
very
smooth
dense
and
mouthfilling
feel
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
believe
river
horse
makes
if
i
ever
order
from
halftime
beverage
again
i
will
pick
up
a
six
pack
great
quality
stout
overall
a
very
well
balanced
oatmeal
milk
stout
i
can
easily
see
having
a
few
in
a
sitting
heck
i
wish
i
had
another
one
right
now
but
sadly
i
only
bought
a
6pack
and
this
was
my
last
one
i
hope
i
can
make
my
way
back
to
the
local
beer
store
to
get
one
more
six
pack
before
this
seasonal
disappears
until
next
year
river
horse
clearly
has
a
winner
here
a
perfectly
done
oatmeal
milk
stout
brewed
in
nj
what
else
can
a
beer
lover
ask
for
o
nice
milk
stout
thats
very
easy
to
drink
thanks
mat
poured
into
a
nonic
got
a
nice
2
finger
dark
tan
head
on
a
black
body
roasty
malts
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
tastes
a
bit
like
chocolate
malt
in
beer
form
with
a
bit
of
tang
nice
bitter
note
in
there
mixes
nicely
with
the
overall
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
small
amount
of
carbonation
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
cant
wait
for
my
next
glass
o
quite
nice
for
an
oatmeal
milk
stout
a
combination
that
i
really
enjoyed
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
and
a
beer
that
was
enjoyed
by
all
of
my
guests
at
the
super
bowl
party
probably
the
best
offering
from
this
brewery
that
i
have
experienced
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
was
perhaps
just
a
little
bit
too
sweet
almost
savory
like
a
dessert
beer
but
maybe
thats
what
it
should
be
used
for
jet
black
silky
in
appearence
with
a
nice
cocoa
head
aroma
of
cocoa
and
grain
nice
flavor
of
chocolate
with
a
very
nice
sweetness
lingering
roasted
flavor
faint
vanilla
hints
nice
soft
and
somewhat
silky
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
all
inone
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
had
from
river
horse
overall
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
may
be
river
horses
best
i
could
certainly
sip
on
a
six
pack
on
a
cold
winters
day
o
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
and
am
hoping
to
see
in
bottles
soon
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
growler
filled
at
joe
canals
in
woodbridge
thanks
to
my
brother
overall
the
drinkability
is
excellent
pretty
filling
though
and
the
roasty
character
might
overpower
the
sweets
after
a
while
another
great
brew
from
river
horse
o
not
much
oatmeal
detectable
in
this
one
still
prettty
good
for
a
milk
stout
would
recommend
to
others
o
im
surprised
im
liking
this
as
much
as
i
am
theres
not
much
going
on
but
theres
a
great
balance
of
creamer
sweetness
with
a
coffee
bitter
finish
the
value
is
great
at
9
a
6
pack
and
its
very
drinkable
mo
wow
this
is
one
smooth
beer
mediumfull
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
full
on
silk
mouthfeel
when
you
see
those
lame
commercials
about
overpriced
chocolate
or
yogurt
or
whatever
and
they
keep
saying
smooth
rich
decadence
ooolala
well
river
horse
oatmeal
milk
stout
is
like
that
very
rich
and
creamy
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
in
succession
but
it
is
quite
tasty

this
brew
was
labeled
as
a
brewers
reserve
when
i
had
it
back
in
2010
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
tanbrown
colored
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasted
even
a
little
chocolaty
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
sweetness
to
it
the
roasted
malts
were
nice
and
left
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
to
me
i
wasnt
too
impressed
there
overall
this
beer
was
decent
i
dont
see
why
it
was
a
brewers
reserve
but
if
they
want
to
say
that
i
guess
they
can
o
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
would
have
this
again
at
least
on
tap
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
halffinger
chocolate
colored
head
the
head
floats
for
a
good
while
on
top
of
the
beer
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
wow
what
a
great
looking
beer
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
a
small
hint
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
mild
hop
profile
very
good
carbonation
but
the
beer
seems
a
bit
thin
overall
a
very
good
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
o
my
first
trying
it
im
looking
forward
to
my
second
time
the
pour
was
decent
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
very
quick
head
of
light
tan
that
left
no
lacing
and
hardly
anything
on
top
this
was
worrisome
for
me
at
first
as
i
was
afraid
it
may
have
been
a
bit
flat
but
it
was
just
the
look
that
appeared
a
bit
off
aroma
of
deep
roasted
malts
light
smoke
and
nice
chocolate
notes
start
to
come
through
right
away
smooth
even
and
as
it
warm
relatively
unchanged
light
vanilla
in
here
now
as
i
take
the
first
sip
a
bit
slick
i
was
expecting
a
bit
fuller
feel
to
it
but
the
taste
still
came
across
nicely
smokey
with
nice
notes
of
peat
and
burnt
sugar
mixing
with
a
light
chocolate
and
creamy
lactose
flavor
nicely
done
each
sip
seem
to
get
more
and
more
smokey
which
was
a
nice
touch
and
the
finish
was
just
dry
enough
and
left
just
enough
sweetness
on
the
tongue
to
leave
me
very
pleased
m
mediumlight
body
but
not
too
light
for
the
style
sweet
finish
d
id
enjoy
a
pint
or
two
of
this
d
to
me
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
they
come
the
flavors
do
not
get
old
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
drink
my
favorite
river
horse
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
all
around
d
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
and
could
have
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
dvery
smooth
and
refeshing
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
an
inviting
palate
and
gentle
robust
flavors
im
not
too
keen
on
the
smell
a
little
funk
there
otherwise
a
nice
beer
malty
creamy
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
on
the
roast
sweet
but
not
cloying
which
helps
drinkability
a
lot
solid
i
dont
know
if
i
will
buy
this
again
but
it
certainly
was
not
a
disappointment
d
nice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
milk
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
glad
to
have
this
as
a
local
brew
for
me
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
pretty
light
overall
for
me
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
not
too
bad
though
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
all
of
the
time
very
good
beery
by
river
horse
d
pretty
sessionable
with
a
decent
abv
great
flavors
and
great
feel
to
it
d
this
is
a
real
solid
beer
shame
ive
never
run
into
it
here
in
pa
would
definitely
get
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
over
all
enjoying
this
beer
but
i
could
not
see
having
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
also
need
to
reevaluate
in
the
future
the
smoked
jerky
aroma
flavor
curious
this
may
be
why
i
think
it
would
go
with
a
good
bowl
of
venisonbeef
stew
for
an
oatmeal
stout
this
isnt
really
that
heavy
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
with
a
6
7
abv
but
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
noticeable
its
very
easy
to
go
down
d
this
awesome
beer
is
very
easy
to
fall
in
love
with
and
drink
a
few
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
river
horse
beers
by
bottle
is
good
but
on
tap
is
even
better
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
and
if
you
have
the
chance
you
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
ive
also
found
this
to
be
a
good
first
stout
for
people
who
havent
tried
it
and
a
rare
exception
for
people
who
usually
dont
care
for
stouts
d
quite
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
bottom
may
grate
on
milk
stout
connoisseurs
overall
the
drinkability
is
good
here
pretty
filling
though
and
the
roasty
character
might
overpower
the
sweets
after
a
while
one
of
the
best
offering
i
have
had
from
river
horse
thats
for
sure
good
hybrid
style
brew
overall
not
bad
but
a
bit
burnt
of
the
tongue
somewhat
drinkable
for
what
it
is
bottle

pours
a
drak
cola
colored
brown
with
a
slightly
tan
12
finger
head
light
roast
coffee
and
leather
aromatics
in
the
nose
some
malty
sweetness
present
in
the
nose
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
sort
of
like
drinking
a
light
roast
cold
press
coffee
with
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
lactose
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
not
bad
but
nothing
super
stellar
either
drinks
easy
and
quick
nice
for
a
brisk
evening
by
an
outside
fire
or
perfect
for
breakfast
i
highly
recommend
this
if
you
can
get
it
one
of
the
better
takes
on
the
style
d
not
a
huge
beer
so
its
pretty
drinkable
i
could
dig
this
beer
with
some
smores
on
a
cold
night
by
the
campfire
beer
is
surprisingly
light
in
body
but
overall
creamy
in
the
mouth
all
the
flavors
are
pretty
subdued
though
some
bitterness
in
the
back
but
only
mild
to
moderate
sweetness
up
front
no
oatmeal
so
i
guess
its
just
a
body
component
but
it
doesnt
really
fill
out
the
beer
its
pretty
mild
and
overall
drinkable
its
pretty
good
md
very
good
tasting
very
creamy
with
good
carbonation
d
very
nice
not
normally
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
loved
the
smooth
nature
of
this
alongside
the
very
nice
balance
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
drinkability
smooth
and
reasonably
wellbalanced
not
a
bad
little
milk
stout
really
pours
a
rich
deep
dark

decent
head
but
minimal
retention
lacing
smell
is
of
dry
hot
chocolate
mix
bitter

but
sweet

an

is

chalky
finish
minimal
aftertaste
good
beer
scent
showed
lots
of

the

defeats
the
lactose
would
be
a
top
notch
beer
if
adjusted

pi
day
overall
i
like
this
one
although
after
finishing
the
whole
pint
you
kind
of
lose
the
milk
stout
feel
good
but
not
great
this
is
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
i
will
be
trying
more
now
overall
a
very
nice
beer
id
like
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
d
a
pretty
decent
stout
by
basic
stout
standards
nothing
offending
but
nothing
eyeopening
either
i
do
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
stout
for
the
first
time
easy
to
drink
but
not
mind
blowing
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
starts
out
with
moldy
taste
and
then
overtaken
by
big
coffee
wierd
and
not
too
drinkable
the
smell
was
not
the
roast
i
was
expecting
rather
neutral
instead
i
should
have
complained
to
try
another
but
have
been
warned
that
you
dont
get
too
far
at
this
bar
regardless
of
your
bad
experience
colour
was
fine
as
was
carbonation
oats
do
a
lot
for
the
body
something
metallic
in
the
middle
thats
not
quite
right
though
d
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
stout
it
seemed
pretty
light
and
i
could
drink
many
of
these
go
phillies
d
i
dont
know
if
i
have
ever
had
an
oatmeal
milk
stout
before
but
i
really
liked
this
one
i
would
recommend
and
will
seek
out
and
other
of
rhs
offerings
i
seem
to
remember
last
years
being
heavier
on
the
cocoa
sweeter
and
denser
however
this
year
is
still
a
good
stout
that
i
would
recommend
pours
a
great
pitch
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
diminishes
slowly
and
laces
nicely
wonderfully
milkyhoney
nose
sweet
and
full
the
taste
is
everything
it
could
be
nice
roasted
malts
that
milky
taste
mixed
with
a
great
sweetness
that
doesnt
overpower
the
roasted
oatmeal
finishes
off
the
taste
interesting
combo
i
really
enjoyed
it
get
it
if
you
can
d
not
as
sweet
as
many
of
the
other
sweet
stouts
ive
experienced
but
overall
quite
enjoyable
o
i
have
to
pick
some
of
this
up
whenever
i
see
it
again
it
should
be
in
production
more
often
a
solid
beer
indeed
d
its
not
exactly
a
sessionable
beer
nothing
too
enjoyable
to
bring
you
back
for
more
very
tasty
nonetheless
dth
drinkability
is
decent
but
im
not
sold
on
this
beer
i
might
give
it
another
go
sometime
but
it
certainly
wont
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
an
over
all
very
good
oatmeal
milk
stout
i
enjoy
a
good
stout
and
i
would
get
this
again
if
you
can
find
this
oatmeal
stout
pick
it
up
d
a
beer
my
wife
and
i
can
agree
on
sneaks
up
on
you
d
the
smokiness
could
get
overwhelming
after
a
while
but
one
or
two
of
these
is
great
poured
from
a

with

some

taste
like
it
smells
oats
and
cream
a
bit
sweet
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has

this
makes
for

pretty
drinkable
a
solid
beer
overall
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
half
finger
fizzy
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
into
nothing
the
beer
ends
up
looking
like
a
cup
of
black
coffee
no
real
carbonation
can
be
seen
no
lacing
is
left
on
my
glass
at
all
either
the
smell
here
is
amazing
smells
like
a
latte
almost
roasted
coffee
and
sweets
mixed
with
roasted
malts
and
oatmeal
the
good
sweets
are
definitely
from
the
oatmeal
taste
is
almost
the
same
roasted
malts
and
coffee
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
a
bit
of
sweets
but
then
there
is
some
weird
watery
taste
that
throws
it
all
off
but
does
not
ruin
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
here
too
pretty
creamy
but
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
and
fizzyness
throws
the
stout
character
off
sweet
oat
flavor
is
left
on
the
tongue
as
a
good
after
taste
drinkability
is
good
here
no
bad
alcohol
flavors
pretty
filling
though
and
the
roasty
character
might
overpower
the
sweets
after
a
while
good
six
pack
for
sure
though
d
pretty
darned
quaffable

with
ruby

an

is

lots
of

in

as
well
some
big
fruit
and
caramel
shore
up
the
middle
smooth
body
and
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
amply
tasty
d
this
is
really
not
a
heavy
stout
but
its
so
ridiculously
balanced
you
must
find
this
one
it
blows
all
non

i
really
like
this

the

happily
drink
again

hv
d
pretty
easy
drinker
could
have
had
one
more
of
these
for
sure
not
too
high
abv
either
not
too
over
powering
on

taste
is

cream
overall
a
little
bit
thin
on
the
flavor
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
i
would
recommend
to
stout
drinkers
and
i
m
pretty
sure
i
would
purchase
again
d
i
liked
this
one
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
something
i
have
no
idea
what
was
missing
d
oh
yeah
very
much
nicely
done
ive
been
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
beers
from
river
horse
within
the
last
year
and
a
half
or
so
and
this
one
really
helps
to
bolster
my
opinion
of
them
river
horse
asks
us
to
break
out
of
the
ordinary
which
may
be
more
of
a
do
as
i
say
and
not
as
i
do
kind
of
thing
all
of
their
beers
ive
yet
to
try
were
very
ordinary
styles
albeit
ones
brewed
fantastically
what
i
do
intend
to
break
out
in
the
future
is
definitely
more
river
horse
offerings
i
hope
theyre
all
as
good
as
this
one
overall
sure
man
anytime
poured
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
faint
some
roast
some
sweet
malt
notes
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
definitely
lactose
present
then
transitions
to
light
roast
and
smoke
and
ends
sharply
bitter
the
body
is
ok
id
expect
a
little
more
from
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
decent
beer
d
pretty
good
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
anymore
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
its
something
i
might
pick
up
if
i
lived
in
the
area
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
seek
it
out
though
flavor
delivers
a
wellbalanced
mix
of
toasted
chocolate
coffee
malts
vanilla
oats
and
lactose
body
is
silky
smooth
with
a
velvet
consistency
and
a
gentle
carbonation
level
that
coats
the
palate
and
allows
the
complexity
of
the
malts
milk
to
shine
all
in
all
a
solid
tasty
milkoatmeal
stout
that
id
be
eager
to
have
again
d
only
slightly
above
average
here
way
overcarbonated
lacked
a
real
milky
and
cremay
nature
and
cant
say
this
was
particular
good
when
compared
to
such
staples
as
youngs
or
even
sam
adams
and
lancasters
milk
stout
which
i
found
to
be
exceptional
much
better
out
there
by
style
this
was
also
a
little
on
the
high
side
abv
wise
which
would
limit
multiples
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
really
nice
black
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
lactose
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
sharp
roasted
flavor
that
boasts
of
black
and
chocolate
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
the
slightest
bit
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
sweet
stout
it
has
excellent
malt
complexity
and
isnt
overly
sweet
just
right
drinkability
very
cool
brew
a
very
distinct
toastiness
with
lots
of
harsh
flavors
i
really
like
it
but
would
have
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
is
mass
quantities
recommended
5
stars
md
light
carbonation
with
a
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
good
drinkability
hindered
only
by
body
of
the
beer
my
favorite
milk
stout
to
date
nice
but
didnt
too
a
whole
lot
for
me
i
can
see
putting
back
a
few
of
these
on
any
given
night
though
d
very
smooth
and
light
bodied
drink
the
taste
doesnt
back
up
in
your
mouth
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
thank
you
for
the
extra
giglemesh
d
bitter
roast
and
strong
alcohol
presence
dont
lend
this
to
being
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
was
enjoyable
but
i
dont
mind
that
this
was
a
one
time
limited
release
md
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
light
enough
to
session

this

is
a
meal
in

i
only
wished
that
i
had
picked
up
another
sixer
it
says
that
it
is
a
limited
edition
offering
the
brewery
should
definitely
bring
this
one
back
again
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
i
think
that
you
will
enjoy
it
d
this
beer
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
6
7
alcohol
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
taste
now
lately
i
have
been
drinking
the
bcs
from
brooklyn
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
it
has
a
very
good
taste
coffee
with
a
very
very
slight
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
no
alcohol
taste
at
all
i
cant
tell
if
i
miss
that
or
not
but
this
is
a
worthy
beer
d
near
perfect
straightforward
presentation
of
2
or
3
chief
elements
no
unpleasant
notes
no
hint
of
nearly
7
abv
dark
black
with
a
mediumish
tan
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
all
chocolate
powder
and
a
little
cappucino
the
taste
is
not
complex
but
oh
so
good
it
is
like
drinking
a
frozen
hot
chocolate
with
some
offsetting
bitterness
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
excessively
drinkable
impossible
to
tase
any
of
the
6
7
abv
well
done
river
horse
now
remake
the
rest
of
the
line
up
update
ive
since
tried
sierra
nevada
stout
and
have
to
say
its
very
similar
to
the
oatmeal
milk
stout
if
anyone
is
having
a
hard
time
finding
the
river
horse
variant
the
sierra
nevada
shouldnt
be
difficult
to
track
down
and
will
give
you
a
very
good
idea
of
what
to
expect
think
of
the
river
horse
as
a
slightly
thicker
slightly
maltier
and
less
bitter
version
of
the
sierra
nevada
serving
type
kegerator
no
detectable
alcohol
which
is
nice
drinkability
is
decent
i
can
have
more
than
1
abv
isnt
too
high
another
solid
offering
from
this
brewery
d
first
sample
ive
had
of
the
newer
river
horse
beers
and
im
impressed
big
balanced
flavors
without
the
intensity
of
some
other
bigger
stouts
more
of
a
session
stout
if
this
is
style
is
your
type
of
beer
body
was
only
thing
that
didnt
quite
mesh
for
me
as
it
finishes
slightly
sodalike
otherwise
a
great
stout
that
i
will
seek
out
again
edit
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
became
very
milky
nice
enjoyable
session
stout
lets
see
some
jersey
pride
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
attractive
red
highlights
and
a
booming
tower
of
a
brown
head
roasty
toasty
goodness
emanates
from
the
nose
big
burnt
coffee
malt
notes
a
lingering
funk
and
a
slight
pungent
bitterness
semisweet
roasted
chocolate
malt
attacks
first
directly
followed
by
a
very
bitter
coffee
bean
flavor
orange
peel
and
a
floral
grassyness
on
the
finish
smooth
oily
slick
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
lightmedium
body
that
is
just
crazy
drinkable
really
liking
the
changes
im
tasting
keep
up
the
good
work
river
horse
this
is
the
best
bottled
river
horse
beers
so
far
they
are
making
some
changes
over
there
and
this
milk
stout
proves
it
it
wasnt
overly
roasted
and
you
even
get
a
tiny
taste
of
milk
if
there
is
one
river
horse
beer
you
need
to
try
this
is
the
one
a
six
pack
of
this
wont
last
for
very
long
d
one
of
the
highest
i
have
had
for
the
style
i
would
guess
abv
coming
in
about
4
so
obviously
well
hidden
and
constructed
keep
em
up
river
horse
well
done
riverhorse
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
and
probably
my
favourite
of
anything
ive
sampled
from
river
horse
i
know
ive
knocked
their
regular
lineup
in
the
past
as
being
mediocre
but
the
seasonals
have
been
breathing
some
life
back
into
the
brewery
and
the
new
ish
brewers
reserve
series
has
been
doing
an
even
better
job
cranking
out
inspired
well
made
brews
skip
the
basics
and
head
for
the
limited
stuff
when
it
comes
to
river
horse
and
make
this
one
your
top
priority
a
very
nice
beer
hmmm
after
puting
in
my
rating
and
then
reading
the
others
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
especially
from
the
flat
pour
to
flatter
body
i
may
have
to
give
this
one
another
shot
recommended
d
a
great
stouti
really
enjoyed
the
full
flavor
combo
of
smooth
malt
and
creamy
milk
stou
in
one
bottle
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
hint
of
cherry
color
large
2
tan
head
smells
of
malted
milk
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
beans
taste
is
more
of
vanilla
toffee
or
coffee
than
the
milk
its
definitely
sweet
with
a
not
malt
background
and
a
tuch
of
hops
at
the
finish
very
smooth
with
a
bit
af
carbonation
at
the
back
of
the
throat
there
is
not
a
hint
of
the
6
7
abv
definitely
one
of
the
better
river
horse
options
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
and
really
enjoyable
to
drink
definitely
recommend
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
stout
despite
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
contents
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
this
brewery
very
drinkable
w
a
slight
hop
bite
i
am
excited
that
riverhorse
is
expanding
their
line
of
beer
w
a
variety
of
special
releases
i
will
enjoy
this
beer
again
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
a
long
time
after
hearing
about
it
from
the
people
at
the
brewery
finally
found
some
yesterday
and
was
very
excited
riverhorse
proved
again
why
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
smooth
feel
with
a
creamy
finish
exactly
what
i
expected
this
beer
was
easy
on
the
mouth
and
had
a
couple
of
surprises
a
slight
taste
of
hops
at
the
end
was
a
delight
combined
with
a
warm
smokey
flavor
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
expand
their
beer
palate
yum
delicious
a
nice
stout
doesnt
quite
have
the
lactose
and
sweetness
that
others
have
but
as
a
sweetish
stout
its
very
nice
alcohol
is
reasonably
but
not
completely
wellcovered
if
it
were
more
so
or
lowered
i
could
easily
drink
plenty
of
this
one
as
it
is
still
very
drinkable
d
easy
drinking
milk
stout
for
sure
river
horse
is
making
better
beers
what
a
find
this
is
heaven
the
best
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
low
alc
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
night
i
love
it
dark
o
very
sessionable
you
just
want
to
keep
sipping
this
one
til
the
cows
come
home
its
changed
slightly
over
the
years
but
then
again
its
been
in
and
out
of
production
allot
yum
slightly
smoky
followed
by
a
nutty
and
chocolate
finish
wish
it
was
sold
in
sc
enjoy
i
know
that
milk
stouts
are
supposed
to
be
sweet
but
the
best
of
this
style
balance
the
sweetness
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
this
offering
falls
too
far
into
the
sweet
category
for
my
liking
o
excellent
overall
nice
stout
that
is
a
touch
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
very
tasty
nonetheless
and
i
understand
why
this
beer
was
the
original
milk
stout
this
may
be
the
classic
milksweet
stout
although
technically
xxx
is
a
stronger
version
brewed
in
trinidad
not
the
same
exact
beer
as
the
lower
abv
version
from
the
uk
but
whatever
mackeson
xxx
pours
an
inky
black
hue
maybe
just
shy
of
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
ample
mocha
colored
head
but
this
breaks
down
quite
quickly
smells
like
coffee
extract
brown
toast
iron
oxide
a
touch
of
smoke
a
whiff
of
earthy
english
bittering
hops
palate
is
chocolate
milk
butterscotch
toffee
cold
coffee
a
little
raisin
and
walnut
ample
malt
character
and
one
can
taste
those
earthy
english
hops
just
a
bit
as
well
silky
smooth
creamy
body
but
not
thick
at
all
high
drinkability
for
such
a
dark
beer
finish
is
sweet
and
malty
but
not
cloying
theres
a
little
husky
astringency
which
provides
a
foil
to
the
other
components
on
the
palate
my
high
ratings
may
reflect
some
bias
towards
sweet
dark
beers
and
this
one
is
super
sweet
minimally
bitter
and
not
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
bomb
like
some
wellcrafted
stouts
hailing
from
other
styles
a
pleasant
diversion
from
my
usual
quest
for
hoppy
and
bitter
or
malty
and
thick
although
i
suppose
this
one
does
evoke
a
chocolate
and
coffee
milkshake
a
healthy
nice
full
drink
gotta
lovem
i
personally
like
stout
and
of
all
the
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
because
they
did
not
skimp
on
the
malt
i
like
this
the
most
huge
malt
taste
dominates
significant
hops
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
drink
that
cries
out
for
a
very
hearty
pairing
smoked
meats
or
fish
robust
multigrained
bread
with
dominating
aged
cheese
such
as
roaring
forties
bleu
like
an
islay
single
malt
it
is
not
a
beer
that
anyone
will
not
have
an
opinion
about
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
in
about
2
years
and
i
am
dismayed
if
it
is
no
longer
brewed
if
anyone
knows
something
similar
let
me
know
wrote
this
review
back
in
1984
was
brewed
by
whitbread
at
the
time
poured
to
a
black
in
color
with
a
rich
head
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
bitter
sweet
malty
taste
at
the

i
gave
it
a
six
mug
rating

of
a
possible
six
so
it
must
have
been
good
mainly
wanted
to
review
this
beer
because
it
still
exists
got
a
sixer
last
week
in
ky
at
the
liquor
barn
beautiful
onyx
black
appearance
with
a
tan
head
sweet
smell
great
mild
chocolate
and
creamy
taste
and
the
lactose
gives
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
hadnt
seen
it
for
years
it
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
sorry
for
the
unofficial
review
but
im
so
passionate
about
this
beer
i
cant
let
this
amazing
community
be
given
incorrect
information
i
would
give
almost
anything
to
have
this
beer
one
more
time
o
overall
pretty
decent
brew
something
i
would
certainly
pick
up
if
i
saw
it
again
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
seeking
out
more
bottles
i
remember
buying
this
beer
because
i
liked
the
look
of
the
label
the
red
black
and
white
was
very
attractive
to
me
i
picked
up
a
bottle
back
in
april
of
2008
and
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
creamy
wooden
barrel
aromas
coming
off
of
it
along
with
some
sweet
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
creamy
and
had
a
very
nice
flavor
all
the
things
i
mentioned
from
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
creamy
overall
ill
miss
this
beer
had
no
clue
it
was
retired
till
now
maybe
ill
stumble
upon
some
again
one
day
down
the
road
and
get
to
try
it
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
smooth
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
poured
it
looked
inviting
creamy
and
bubbly
to
this
it
did
not
disappoint
with
the
mouth
left
coated
and
satiated
actually
what
is
almost
even
more
impressive
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
made
in
the
caribbean
you
certainly
would
not
expect
a
stout
to
come
from
this
region
and
certainly
not
a
decent
one
so
that
was
a
nice
surprise
in
itself
d
one
of
the
most
quaffable
milk
stouts
i
have
had
although
this
version
from
carib
just
seems
to
lack
a
little
bit
of
the
polish
i
remember
from
the
whitbread
mackesons
xxx
i
remember
being
in
love
with
beer
5
years
ago
so
smooth
rich
like
drinking
a
smore
this
doesnt
hold
up
to
those
memories
but
still
pretty
tasty
drinkable
i
wish
this
was
still
more
readily
available
many
thanks
to
hayesez
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
few
more
bottles
i
wanted
to
try
as
many
different
beers
as
i
could
in
st
martinst
maarten
and
the
main
choices
were
pale
lagers
and
stout
guinness
was
the
stout
that
most
bars
on
the
island
featured
but
i
found
this
beer
for
sale
at
lepicierie
de
la
plage
on
boulevard
grand
case
for
1
50
each
this
was
stout
4
that
i
sampled
poured
into
a
tall
glass
had
a
dark
appearance
with
a
tan
colored
head
smell
was
like
roasted
cocoa
and
coffee
really
liked
the
taste
but
it
was
a
tad
on
the
tame
side
nothing
stood
out
the
other
milk
stout
from
carib
that
i
tried
the
royal
extra
stout
was
super
sweet
but
6
5
abv
mackeson
which
is
also
a
milksweet
stout
from
the
same
brewery
tasted
more
like
an
irish
stout
and
did
not
have
that
sweetness
i
expected
plus
the
abv
is
much
lower
in
this
beer
so
if
you
want
a
sweet
stout
my
vote
is
for
royal
extra
if
you
want
a
low
abv
dry
stout
then
mackeson
is
a
good
choice
down
in
the
caribbean
im
not
sure
how
old
this
is
it
was
not
good
at
all
in
my
opinion
d
i
can
see
why
suitcase
jon
told
me
to
drink
this
as
a
beer
float
d
this
was
everywhere
in
dominica
too
bad
it
wasnt
very
good
d
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
seemed
pretty
average
to
me
it
not
a
bad
sessionable
stout
but
id
rather
have
an
americian
stout
over
this
one
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
sweeter
sweet
stouts
but
the
malt
backbone
is
very
balanced
think
of
it
like
a
smoother
sam
smith
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
quite
a
few
of
them
over
the
years
sadly
this
may
be
my
last
one
since
they
are
not
making
it
anymore
from
what
i
hear
i
certainly
hope
that
someone
starts
making
it
again
someday
not
necessarily
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
quite
filling
but
this
is
an
excellent
stout
very
flavorful
and
interesting
picked
this
one
up
in
st
thomas
the
locals
told
me
the
love
it
this
is
my
favorite
milk
stoutits
got
a
terrific
aroma
and
exceptional
flavor
unlike
many
milk
stouts
mackeson
xxx
does
not
start
off
bitter
and
fade
into
sweet
it
starts
off
somewhat
bold
but
without
biting
it
finishes
smooth
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
sweetened
condensed
milk
cant
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
those
one
or
two
are
terrific
nice
mouth
coating
chewiness
big
and
rich
but
very
very
drinkable
i
found
this
in
a
broken
six
and
bought
a
single
i
know
that
distribution
issues
are
preventing
this
from
hitting
the
market
so
this
was
probably
a
stockroom
holdover
i
think
im
gonna
get
the
last
3
bottles
it
would
be
a
shame
if
this
was
the
last
time
i
had
this
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
find
this
try
it
it
is
a
treat
d
this
is
a
great
brew
very
heavy
so
id
have
it
for
or
with
dessert
12
oz
black
pour
small
cream
colored
head
doesnt
last
too
long
very
malty
creamy
sweet
i
dont
get
as
much
chocolate
as
others
here
however
nothing
to
balance
this
out
could
use
a
little
more
roast
coffee
and
or
malts
full
bodied
definetely
a
sweet
stout
could
take
it
or
leave
it
many
others
in
the
style
i
would
prefer
used
to
like
this
one
much
more
until
i
discovered
others
d
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
i
have
started
to
become
a
huge
fan
of
the
milk
stouts
the
sweetness
keeps
this
one
on
the
list
to
come
back
to
appearance
is
pitch
black
with
a
tanned
head
that
dissolves
fairly
fast
aroma
is
pleasantly
sweet
initial
taste
is
full
of
the
sweetness
brought
on
by
the
lactose
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
has
a
very
soft
and
lightly
bodied
mouthfeel
considering
its
very
dark
appearance
pours
a
pitch
black
colored
body
with
a
small
tan
colored
head
that
is
somewhat
lasting
has
a
coffee
chocolate
and
smokey
aroma
with
grapes
maybe
a
very
nice
taste
of
sweetness
smoke
and
some
bittersweetness
very
tasty
satisfying
incredibly
drinking
brew
not
big
on
abv
but
probably
the
nicest
straight
up
stout
or
milk
stout
i
have
drank
in
quite
some
time
very
solid
offering
with
a
relatively
low
abv
and
price
i
will
definitely
get
another
one
of
these
if
i
see
it
again
i
picked
up
the
last
one
off
the
shelf
at
my
local
my
final
thoughts
are
that
this
is
a
good
beer
the
flavor
was
not
mindblowing
but
it
had
the
main
qualities
i
look
for
in
a
sweet
stout
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
compliment
many
dessert
items
or
as
a
dessert
item
a
big
piece
of
chocolate
cake
would
be
perfect
d
not
the
best
tasting
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
but
it
was
outstanding
and
damn
near
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
before
i
knew
what
happened
i
guess
you
call
that
highly
sessionable
d
the
brits
know
their
coffee
and
stouts
good
complex
flavor
pretty
good
atmosphere
just
a
strong
overall
quaff
958416
4
15
pours
a
lovely
opaque
brown
the
smell
is
delicate
coffee
and
cocoa
it
tastes
like
very
nuanced
milk
chocolate
layered
with
subtle
hints
of
coffee
and
fleeting
alcohol
while
its
possible
in
theory
to
improve
the
flavor
i
am
simply
unable
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
how
the
mouthfeel
is
delightful
pleasantly
crisp
and
smooth
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
and
hope
to
have
again
and
again
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
spent
motor
oil
color
and
consistency
with
a
large
dark
tancocoa
color
head
that
leaves
behind
some
chunky
lacing
a
milk
stout
cant
get
any
better
looking
than
this
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
goodness
roasted
malt
with
an
underlying
coffee
and
sour
note
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
creamy
silky
smooth
only
slightly
sweet
and
an
incredible
creamy
flavor
and
feel
milk
chocolate
notes
are
first
and
foremost
only
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
this
beer
is
so
damn
smooth
and
creamy
its
unbelievable
low
abv
makes
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
for
stout
i
wouldnt
mind
putting
back
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
its
so
tasty
and
so
easy
to
drink
very
nice
sweet
stout
and
probably
the
best
ive
tried
i
liked
this
stout
but
did
not
love
it
i
have
had
better
but
i
would
not
mind
drinking
this
again
but
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
gte
it
d
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
stout
i
plan
on
doing
a
side
by
side
of
bells
double
cream
and
this
one
soon
a
bit
hard
to
find
in
my
area
thanks
so
much
to
schellsbeer
for
hooking
me
up
words
cant
do
justice
to
this
beer
so
i
think
i
will
stop
inky
black
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
in
the
glass
pretty
imposing
and
similar
to
an
ris
in
appearance
the
smell
is
of
soft
roasted
grain
coffee
and
cream
and
maybe
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
its
faint
the
taste
isnt
typical
stout
but
subdued
the
roasty
graininess
is
lighter
in
texture
than
a
dry
stout
but
the
flavor
his
also
very
creamy
im
getting
the
full
range
of
chocolates
to
coffee
even
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
body
is
great
with
the
lactose
really
full
and
creamy
finish
is
just
a
touch
dry
and
a
bit
metallic
but
very
nice
and
welll
done
great
sessionable
stout
simple
as
that
aroma
is
milk
chocolate
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
molasses
mouthfeel
is
moderately
heavy
with
almost
zero
carbonation
i
drank
two
watching
football
sunday
afternoon
and
felt
full
afterwords
fairly
low
alcohol
content
flavor
is
milk
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
molasses
a
sweet
brew
but
not
cloyingly
so
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
very
thin
head
smell
sweet
ana
chocolaty
but
not
very
strong
overall
taste
chocolate
milk
cofee
with
some
sweetness
very
interesting
taste
mouthfeel
well
balanced
medium
bodied
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
very
pleasant
overall
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
its
very
good
brew
id
have
couple
more
really
enjoyed
it
very
drinkable
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
much
more
body
than
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
the
taste
is
full
and
mostly
sweet
it
has
a
lot
of
rich
creamy
caramelly
chocolate
wheat
bread
with
a
hints
of
licorice
and
coffee
especially
in
the
finish
there
is
a
light
bitterness
near
the
finish
the
palate
is
thick
full
and
creamy
but
lively
d
is
very
drinkable
d
yep
d
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
too
many
but
again
doesnt
really
feel
like
im
drinking
alcohol
so
itd
be
easy
to
enjoy
a
couple
d
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
have
one
or
two
but
for
me
anything
past
that
would
be
pushing
it
its
just
to
sweet
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
the
beer
poured
a
rich
black
with
a
mahogany
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
chocolate
malt
the
taste
has
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
dark
berries
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
heavy
and
dry
this
is
one
of
the
sweetest
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
run
across
just
a
wonderful
beer
and
im
going
to
run
right
out
and
buy
a
six
overall
an
extremely
sweet
stout
that
wasnt
for
me
but
may
be
your
style
smell
is
roasted
malts
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
molasses
taste
is
much
more
chocolate
than
was
in
the
nose
a
good
amount
of
bittering
hops
and
carbonation
medium
body
on
the
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
and
wont
do
too
much
damage
at
around
12
for
a
twelve
pack
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
deep
chocolate
pour
with
a
tan
foamy
head
smooth
mouthfeel
a
welcome
sweetness
that
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
without
feeling
full
the
low
abv
attributes
to
the
smoothness
sweetness
and
highly
drinkable
aspects
of
this
fine
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
thats
a
good
value
certainly
worth
a
shot
md
carbonation
is
right
on
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
one
is
not
too
sweet
like
a
lot
of
other
milk
stouts
can
be
normally
i
like
to
reserve
this
category
for
desert
but
this
one
is
easily
sessionable
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
is
a
pickme
up
very
easy
going
down
however
not
an
everyday
brew
here
i
highly
recommend
this
one
to
any
fan
of
milk
stout
the
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
better
is
to
taste
this
brew
ontap
served
in
a
tulip
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
half
inch
dense
mochacolored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
broken
film
in
under
30
seconds
leaving
behind
a
tight
band
around
the
bowl
of
the
glass
some
spatterings
of
lacing
present
during
the
session
aromas
of
dark
fruit
toffee
and
molasses
intermingled
as
well
as
something
else
in
the
back
perhaps
lactose
flavor
profile
is
difficult
to
describe
there
are
elements
of
the
nose
present
but
the
balance
seems
off
and
character
seems
muddled
maybe
lactose
maybe
coffee
perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
buttery
feel
at
the
finish
but
seems
a
little
offstyle
drinkability
is
okay
on
this
one
however
it
just
didnt
come
together
for
me
in
the
end
super
easy
to
drink
although
i
dislike
the
buttery
notes
this
one
fits
the
bill
for
a
sweet
stout
the
milkiness
eclipses
most
of
the
roasted
flavors
and
its
sweetness
dominates
the
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
money
out
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
and
overall
sweet
but
delightful
and
easy
drinking
serving
bottle
to
pint
glass
i
saw
this
in
the
grocery
store
today
it
was
on
sale
so
i
picked
up
a
sixer
i
recognized
the
brewery
as
the
same
one
that
produces
sam
adams
so
i
figured
it
had
to
be
above
par
i
poured
the
bottle
straight
down
the
middle
of
a
pint
glass
and
was
rewarded
with
a
deep
dark
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
beer
which
i
was
thankful
for
this
beer
tastes
good
not
great
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
pretty
standard
no
big
thrills
here
i
enjoyed
a
couple
back
to
back
as
they
finish
easily
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
this
is
under
5
i
assumed
a
xxx
stout
would
perhaps
mean
strong
or
at
least
6
5
not
a
big
deal
since
the
beer
held
its
own
that
was
a
while
back
it
was
the
u
k
and
it
was
a
cold
winter
during
a
sweaty
new
england
summer
this
beer
seems
a
bit
too
rich
tasty
but
rich
d
an
excellent
beer
and
a
furthermore
a
very
drinkable
stout
glad
to
see
a
low
abv
as
welll
this
may
enter
into
my
regular
rotation
drinkability
however
is
good
you
can
top
off
a
six
pack
of
these
fairly
quickly
as
theyre
smooth
and
sweet
for
a
stout
good
stuff
deep
black
color
with
a
brown
foam
head
a
hint
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
reminiscent
of
the
banana
smell
in
a
wheat
beer
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
lightweight
stout
i
said
a
b
on
my
personal
scale
compared
to
other
beers
a
lovely
drink
just
as
good
as
the
real
mackeson
that
i
remember
from
my
youth
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
cream
stout
great
tasting
but
i
think
the
drinkability
is
lowered
a
bit
due
to
the
fact
that
its
pretty
sweet
in
any
case
great
tasting
beer
this
beer
has
it
all
fairly
inexpensive
widely
available
amazing
beer
experience
all
around
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
fall
in
love
when
others
had
just
shown
me
a
good
time
with
such
a
low
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkablesessionable
beer
its
a
lighter
milk
stout
than
some
ive
had
and
it
goes
down
easily
i
could
easily
sit
down
and
drink
this
all
night
rich
but
not
overly
filling
a
very
pleasant
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
this
mackeson
triple
xxx
stout
one
of
the
darkest
brews
i
have
seen
in
awhile
the
head
was
absolutely
gorgeous
brown
and
frothy
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
creamy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
wow
this
brew
is
so
smooth
and
creamy
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
vanilla
there
is
a
little
bit
of
coffee
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
the
flavor
and
feel
of
creme
is
awesome
while
the
initial
feel
to
the
tongue
is
thick
and
creamy
the
overall
feel
is
a
little
weaker
than
i
would
have
expected
but
the
smoothness
makes
up
for
that
an
incredible
experience
while
i
didnt
pick
up
on
much
chocolate
at
first
when
i
got
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
it
was
noticeable
i
would
drink
this
all
night
until
i
was
filled
to
the
brim
overall
a
solid
option
and
good
stout
for
all
occasions
especially
as
a
dessert
or
breakfast
beer
d
a
standardbearer
for
milk
stouts
and
maybe
the
best
of
this
category
consistent
and
delicious
creamy
and
sticky
with
good
carbonation
lasting
sticky
bittersweet
finish
d
yes
two
of
these
would
go
down
well
d
very
rich
flavors
and
a
bit
of
a
heavy
body
limit
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
however
it
tastes
so
good
that
it
almost
doesnt
matter
i
drank
this
one
slow
and
enjoyed
it
definitely
need
to
pick
it
up
again
drinkability
good
heavy
definetly
couldnt
get
drunk
enough
to
beat
my
wife
slight
downside
to
an
otherwise
great
beer
may
others
enjoy
this
brew
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
d
not
overly
complex
but
pleasant
and
drinkable
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
damn
good
beer
maybe
a
wee
bit
too
sweet
and
heavy
to
be
sessionable
but
still
a
great
beer
im
probably
going
to
have
this
in
the
morning
sometime
with
some
oatmeal
d
this
is
a
bit
sweet
but
oh
so
tasty
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
i
just
feel
like
a
pig
after
very
drinkable
great
beer
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
delicious
and
leaves
me
contented
with
the
entire
experience
i
crave
more
but
not
in
a
huge
quantity
its
almost
like
a
dessert
and
i
feel
that
i
shouldnt
overdue
it
simply
because
it
is
so
good
its
a
very
fulfilling
beverage
good
stuff
recommended
d
smooth
creamy
goes
down
easily
but
perhaps
a
bit
rich
one
or
two
at
a
time
this
poured
pitch
black
with
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
mix
of
licorice
chocolate
and
barley
it
tasted
more
like
a
regular
stout
with
sweet
coffee
flavors
blended
with
mild
earthy
chocolate
it
was
watery
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
had
a
delicate
and
interesting
flavor
which
was
good
but
i
dont
understand
why
they
called
this
a
triple
most
double
stouts
are
more
potent
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
this
style
it
could
be
for
you
i
can
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
as
theyre
a
little
too
heavy
nonetheless
its
a
good
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
milk
stout
and
i
think
the
best
i
have
had
of
the
style
only
down
side
i
can
think
of
is
its
a
twist
off
bottle
and
i
cant
reuse
it
for
homebrewing
d
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
so
good
i
was
just
adventuring
into
some
odd
territory
in
the
beer
store
and
saw
milk
stout
and
figured
what
the
hell
this
was
an
amazing
beer
the
dark
black
no
head
thick
pour
isnt
very
appetizing
to
me
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
amazing
beer
poured
out
a
deep
brown
to
almost
black
in
my
pint
glass
had
4
fingers
of
head
which
recede
quickly
with
moderate
lacing
tasted
stronger
than
abv
indicates
with
heavy
chocolate
and
coffee
influence
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
limit
myself
to
2
at
most
due
to
its
heaviness
great
in
front
of
a
fireplace
on
a
cold
winter
night
a
very
good
beer
that
is
nicely
priced
at
7
99
for
the
sixer
i
picked
up
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
little
more
substantial
feeling
than
a
general
irish
stout
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
it
d
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
but
is
close
the
smoke
helps
but
i
wish
there
was
more
or
more
bitterness
i
good
substitute
for
dessert
though
on
a
side
note
i
would
like
to
actually
try
one
from
the
original
brewery
the
one
i
have
was
brewed
in
cincinnati
oh
md
good
drinkability
could
maybe
drink
two
or
three
in
a
long
night
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
alcohol
content
could
definitely
be
felt
and
the
brew
was
thick
but
not
crazy
thick
so
it
didnt
take
away
from
the
drinkability
nice
and
chocolaty
and
a
good
desert
beer
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
anyway
it
is
a
good
beer
try
some
overall
i
would
put
this
in
my
top
5
beers
not
one
you
can
pound
but
a
nice
heavy
relaxing
winter
beer
great
starter
for
someone
intimidated
by
stouts
or
porters
i
highly
recommend
it
nice
job
on
this
a
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
this
was
my
first
attempt
at
this
style
to
be
honesy
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
after
i
read
the
description
of
what
a
milk
stout
should
be
like
i
think
this
is
dead
on
overall
a
really
solid
beer
pours
very
black
with
ruby
on
the
edges
but
not
that
jet
oily
black
that
the
imperial
stouts
pour
reddish
brown
head
on
top
that
laced
well
smelled
good
with
the
roast
coming
through
first
sip
is
sweet
with
the
roasted
flavors
and
coffee
coming
through
from
middle
to
the
end
very
mild
hops
add
to
the
bitter
finish
which
cuts
through
the
sweetness
up
front
not
alot
of
hidden
fruit
flavors
fairly
well
carbonatedmore
than
typical
stout
but
still
creamy
which
gave
a
nice
feel
and
added
a
crisper
note
at
the
end
than
expected
carbonation
almost
scrubs
off
the
sweet
flavor
very
drinkable
but
may
get
too
sweet
after
a
couple
i
really
enjoyed
this
beerit
balances
the
sweet
and
roasted
flavors
better
than
the
other
sweet
stouts
ive
tried
drinkability
best
dessert
beer
on
the
market
often
overlooked
as
being
too
common
this
beer
needs
its
due
its
not
rare
and
can
be
bought
in
pretty
much
any
grocery
store
most
beer
snobs
consider
it
too
mainstream
but
ive
had
many
of
the
stouts
in
the
beer
advocate
top
100
and
this
one
stands
toe
to
toe
with
most
all
of
them
no
its
not
dark
lord
but
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
a
damn
fine
sweet
stout
and
one
ill
be
glad
to
keep
coming
back
to
over
all
i
highly
recommend
this
one
d
i
would
revisit
this
again
its
a
pretty
unique
beer
that
i
wouldnt
try
and
pair
with
food
it
stands
well
enough
on
its
own
d
compelling
sights
smells
and
tastes
coupled
with
a
low
abv
make
this
a
fantastic
session
stout
pass
me
another
d
overall
quite
good
and
since
it
is
pretty
easy
to
find
i
could
see
this
being
a
solid
everyday
stout
eric
this
is
the
sweetest
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
smells
and
tastes
great
and
goes
down
almost
too
easily
however
its
sweetness
makes
it
hard
to
have
more
than
one
i
came
across
this
brew
in
a
world
market
store
in
cary
nc
not
a
place
i
usually
shop
for
beer
but
then
again
i
dont
recall
seeing
this
in
my
usual
haunts
what
a
great
stout
its
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
with
great
flavor
and
complexity
ill
be
watching
out
for
it
more
often
from
now
on
d
this
complex
beer
has
so
much
going
on
yet
it
remains
very
mild
and
refreshing
a
definite
a
very
drinkable
but
definitely
a
dessert
beer
a
nice
chunk
of
dark
chocolate
would
be
the
perfect
accompaniment
ultrathick
ultradark
moderate
head
malt
aroma
is
strong
enough
to
impact
yet
not
overwhelming
excellent
malt
character
not
thoroughly
devoid
of
hops
but
they
are
very
subtle
sweetness
shows
well
in
the
aroma
and
in
taste
thick
and
creamy
on
the
palate
with
a
solid
finish
excellent
stuff
to
have
maybe
once
or
twice
in
an
evening
my
first
milk
stout
the
lack
of
dating
was
a
concern
from
the
beginning
pours
dark
reddish
black
w
a
thin
medbrown
head
which
dissipates
immediately
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
pint
a
strongly
vinous
butterlike
diacetyl
smell
w
some
alcoholic
and
toffeecoffeelike
undertones
a
rich
sourish
dark
malt
taste
w
a
poweful
butterscotchtoffeenutty
palate
about
midway
w
a
coffeesherrylike
finish
med
and
creamy
mouthfeel
decent
co2
lets
the
flavor
linger
the
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
but
i
just
dont
quite
like
the
taste
also
ill
have
to
try
more
of
this
style
or
beer
to
be
sure
this
one
wasnt
bad
wheres
the
date
dark
dark
black
color
with
no
real
head
but
a
bit
of
dark
brown
froth
on
top
no
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
sweet
most
notable
are
chocolate
maple
toffee
caramel
its
pretty
much
like
candy
taste
is
a
bit
more
robust
than
the
smell
very
creamy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
much
too
thin
though
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
adequate
surprising
low
abv
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
however
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
one
solid
to
be
sure
but
not
outstanding
very
easy
drinking
nothing
rough
about
it
as
smooth
as
a
beer
comes
finish
so
so
smooth
d
this
is
a
great
stout
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
definitely
a
solid
alternative
to
something
like
a
guinness
more
flavor
overall
i
honestly
knew
nothing
of
this
beer
or
what
to
expect
from
it
when
i
included
it
in
a
mixed
sixpack
as
soon
as
a
poured
it
and
observed
the
dark
color
and
coffeechocolate
aroma
i
knew
i
was
going
to
enjoy
it
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
flavor
coffee
chocolatey
and
malty
yet
it
is
balanced
well
and
not
overpowering
i
would
suggest
drinking
this
after
a
meal
and
saving
it
for
your
last
beer
of
the
night
i
drank
a
celebrator
also
a
great
beer
after
this
and
could
barely
even
taste
it
excellent
beer
thick
up
front
and
on
the
back
end
although
the
body
just
kind
of
meanders
along
for
a
bit
in
between
obviously
the
prototype
for
the
style
although
i
cant
help
but
think
im
missing
something
by
drinking
the
contractbrewed
stuff
deep
dark
blackbrown
with
chocolate
milk
colored
head
the
smell
is
of
slightly
sweet
and
burnt
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
lightly
sweet
chocolate
and
blueberries
a
tealike
quality
with
some
moderate
bitterness
creates
a
unique
and
tasty
flavor
combination
the
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
renders
this
beer
sweet
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
make
a
session
out
of
this
light
and
tasty
brew
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
an
inch
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
aroma
is
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
its
a
nice
sweet
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
smoky
taste
in
this
brew
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
theres
a
nice
mix
of
the
two
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
silky
and
creamy
carbonation
is
average
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
id
recommend
this
to
others
to
try
this
is
my
favorite
milk
stout
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
never
get
sick
of
them
and
at
5
99
a
six
pack
at
trader
joes
im
in
hog
heaven
once
you
get
by
the
initial
sweetness
its
a
nice
beer
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
1
per
sitting
though
mouthfeel
thick
and
chewy
like
a
glass
of
whole
milk
incredibly
fullbodied
for
being
less
than
5
abv
lightly
carbonated
even
thought
they
dont
make
it
in
britain
any
more
this
is
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
had
no
expectations
for
this
one
but
was
extremely
surprised
when
i
tried
it
the
combination
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
are
so
well
balanced
and
the
taste
overall
is
so
smooth
as
is
the
feel
that
i
cant
really
think
of
how
it
could
improve
mouth
feel
is
great
if
not
super
and
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
jet
black
in
color
with
a
huge
coffee
colored
head
on
top
just
a
clasic
looking
stout
if
there
ever
was
one
not
much
aromasome
malt
and
a
sweetish
sort
of
tinge
deep
hearty
flavor
just
enough
sweetness
in
it
to
balance
the
roasted
malt
inky
black
roasted
goodness
to
it
like
a
dessert
flavor
full
bodied
amazing
how
much
flavor
a
beer
of
4
9
can
be
i
have
enjoyed
this
for
at
least
25
years
long
before
craft
beers
were
out
there
like
they
are
now
has
always
been
a
classic
beer
d
really
a
fine
beer
and
as
rich
as
it
is
seems
like
it
would
be
a
bit
boozier
nice
to
see
that
this
one
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
as
miles
ahead
of
a
guinness
noticeable
hop
flavor
and
restrained
sweetness
theres
a
significant
colalike
aspect
that
i
imagine
is
a
result
of
spending
a
little
too
much
time
in
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
i
dont
like
it
when
beer
tastes
like
rc
cola
gross
this
is
up
there
w
my
favorite
milk
stouts
not
the
best
one
ive
ever
tasted
but
its
still
really
good
additional
notes
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
for
me
i
find
myself
always
grabbing
12
packs
of
it
at
bevmo
to
keep
around
for
a
beer
i
like
so
well
its
very
affordable
ranging
from
1012
dollars
for
a
12
pack
depending
if
its
on
sale
or
not
pours
out
a
jet
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
dies
quick
to
nothing
no
lacing
smells
of
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
sweet
cocoa
taste
is
mild
bakers
chocolate
cocoa
and
some
mild
dark
fruit
with
a
slight
coffee
bitter
finish
thin
in
the
mouth
with
a
premium
drinkability
yum
d
i
like
most
stouts
but
this
is
the
best
i
have
tried
its
like
dessert
for
me
d
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
overall
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
again
this
winter
highly
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
this
stout
a
great
deal
and
will
look
for
it
again
and
will
buy
again
notes
although
this
stout
is
sweeter
than
i
would
want
for
a
session
beer
i
could
see
having
one
or
two
in
an
evening
would
pair
well
with
food
which
balances
out
the
sweetness
with
the
chocolate
malt
character
i
would
even
call
this
a
dessert
beer
i
could
drink
anotherand
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
first
dark
midnight
black
with
faint
reds
around
the
glass
nice
thick
espresso
brown
head
makes
this
a
very
presentable
beer
the
nose
was
string
of
sweet
chocolates
and
roasted
coffee
beans
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
the
medium
body
is
well
blended
with
the
sugary
malts
and
english
hops
i
would
not
call
it
a
triple
stout
but
this
is
a
very
good
brew
the
head
is
fair
with
a
dense
beginning
that
changes
to
a
foamier
head
at
the
top
it
disappates
halfway
through
my
session
the
head
is
a
very
light
compared
to
the
color
of
the
beer
first
flavor
is
a
the
almost
burnt
caramel
then
a
sweetness
of
coffee
and
butterscotch
after
that
there
is
very
little
bitterness
and
it
is
only
apparent
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
for
a
second
after
i
swallow
all
in
all
i
was
struck
by
the
easy
drinking
and
friendliness
of
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
seek
a
fullbodies
brew
with
a
laidback
style
on
a
nice
day
while
grilling
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
easily
a
good
beer
when
your
looking
for
easy
drinking
with
some
taste
flat
and
black
thin
burgundy
head
with
lacing
smells
sweet
and
molasseslike
toasted
malt
aroma
as
well
tastes
semisweet
and
kind
of
feels
like
a
melted
milkshake
doesnt
have
that
bitter
aftertaste
that
some
of
the
other
stouts
have
not
much
carbonation
very
good
milk
stout
i
like
it
this
brew
is
as
comfortable
to
me
as
a
pair
of
wellworn
jeans
i
first
came
across
it
about
20
years
ago
when
i
first
began
to
go
over
to
the
dark
side
of
the
brewers
art

true
beer
clean

it
pours

the

with

this

let
me
down
this
is
another
onetrick

beer
with
one
overwhelming
taste
sweet
sweet
lactose
if
thats
your
thing
this
may
be
an
impressive
beer
i
felt
the
sweetness
detracted
from
some
of
the
complexity
that
was
hinted
at
with
the
smell
pours
inkyblack
to
the
eye
like
upending
a
bottle
of
kikkoman
held
up
to
the
light
it
remains
opaque
this
would
appear
to
the
novice
as
some
imposing
weighty
stuff
creamy
burnt
sienna
head
is
visually
impressive
while
it
lasts
it
fades
to
a
token
ring
of
lace
within
a
minute
or
two
the
nose
is
roast
malts
with
notes
of
cocoa
iodine
and
medicinal
alcohol
it
actually
suggests
a
tangy
bittersweet
brew
yep
this
is
the
brew
i
remember
from
some
years
back
or
as
near
as
possible
bittersweet
tangy
roasty
and
lactic
tang
all
on
the
first
sip
i
remember
what
a
switchup
this
was
from
a
guinness
back
in
the
days
when
the
only
stouts
we
could
find
were
imported
sweet
almost
too
sweet
with
a
partway
chalky
partway
oily
mouthfeel
somewhat
viscous
with
its
sugary
sweet
creamyness
cut
nicely
by
the
lactic
tang
not
much
alcohol
in
this
one
but
what
there
is
of
it
becomes
more
apparent
in
both
the
nose
and
aromatics
as
it
warms
notes
of
rum
prunes
and
dates
with
some
sour
cherry
thrown
in
there
for
good
measure
the
cocoa
notes
on
the
nose
are
just
as
subdued
on
the
palate
as
is
that
touch
of
iodine
and
both
the
roasted
and
dark
malts
are
prominent
throughout
nice
carbonation
just
enough
to
keep
from
ever
feeling
overbearing
i
think
of
this
as
a
very
proper
dessert
beer
nightcap
or
digestif
the
sweetness
would
keep
it
from
being
something
id
want
to
session
and
it
would
definitely
be
the
last
beer
id
drink
if
i
were
to
have
more
than
a
couple
its
just
got
that
treacly
roasty
lactose
quality
going
for
it
which
would
no
doubt
intrude
on
lighter
ales
an
old
favorite
from
when
it
was
a
true
import
im
glad
to
see
it
holds
up
so
well
so

years
later

thats

enough
to
session
but
also
has
the
subtlety
and
complexity
to
warrant
more
contemplative
drinking
d
simplicity
at
its
best
a
recipe
that
should
never
change
what
a
great
beer
this
is
the
definitive
sweet
stout
on
the
market
when
i
first
sampled
this
brew
i
really
didnt
like
it
this
is
my
fourth
bottle
in
three
weeks
and
i
like
it
it
could
have
a
wider
flavor
offering
the
sweet
molassesraisin
taste
dominates
all
else
the
selfproclaimed
original
and
genuine
triple
stout
can
wear
the
stout
badge
but
it
shouldnt
flaunt
it
not
bad
this
stout
blows
me
away
nice
brown
chunky
head
one
fingered
the
body
black
with
a
beautiful
dark
red
on
the
edges
chocolate
coffee
caramel
so
damn
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
nice
and
sweet
incredible
balance
excellent
kick
ass
stout
d
very
drinkable
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
low
abv
and
smooth
taste
make
it
sessionable
not
as
strong
as
other
stouts
even
milk
stouts
the
pour
is
a
very
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
matching
deep
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
respectable
lacing
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
a
light
coffee
bean
presence
the
flavors
are
an
enjoyable
balance
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
though
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
with
a
light
lactose
flavor
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
for
a
triple
stout
and
in
my
opinion
a
little
watery
drinkability
is
average
overall
this
brew
is
enjoyable
though
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
triple
stout
due
malty
to
the
over
sweet
flavor
balance
this
stuff
is
phenomenal
one
of
the
smoothest
richest
and
downright
tastiest
stouts
i
have
ever
had
ridiculously
addictive
and
drinkable
not
absolutely
terrible
but
i
will
avoid
this
in
the
future
not
impressed
if
you
like
your
beer
to
taste
like
beer
this
one
may
not
be
for
you
but
if
you
like
your
beer
as
a
dessert
substitute
this
one
will
be
right
up
your
alley
d
a
very
good
stout
one
i
could
enjoy
again
again
thanks
for
the
recommendation
pop
this
was
very
nice
i
enjoyed
it
even
if
youre
not
a
huge
stout
fan
i
would
suggest
giving
this
a
try
i
picked
this
up
for
a
little
over
5
for
the
sixer
making
it
an
outstanding
value
too
definitely
recommended
d
goes
down
nice
and
easily
a
very
good
beer
more
than
makes
up
for
some
of
the
horrid
versions
of
this
style
i
have
tried
hoping
to
find
homebrews
like
this
with
next
event
i
judge
d
its
good
but
its
to
sweet
and
thick
to
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
for
me

this
is

but
really
good
for
what
it
is
a

stout
which
is
a
joy
to
drink
overall
a
fantastic
and
complex
stout
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
and
absolutely
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
sweet
stout
and
i
highly
recommend
it
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
complex
and
inviting

with
a

in

toasted

dominate
the
aroma
backed
by
a
touch
of
coffee

it
looks
and
smells
so
good
i
dont
even
want
to
disturb
it
by
tasting
but
after
a
few
minutes
i
bravely
soldier
on
sweet
coffee
comes
out
much
stronger
in
the
taste
with
the
chocolate
taking
a
back
seat
finish
is
incredibly
smooth
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
but
leaves
an
odd
tingle
in
my
mouth
after
a
while
that
only
goes
away
if
i
take
another
sip
when
i
drink
it
more
quickly
the
hops
become
a
little
more
evident
oh
this
is
really
goodand
i
think
the
most
drinkable
stout
ive
ever
encountered
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
consistency
is
a
little
thin
for
the
flavors

some

at

pretty
good

here
id
recommend
trying
it

quite
good

that
was
enough
i
wouldnt
turn

i

for
it

taste
is

sweetness
from

and
maybe
a
little
tartness
in

this
is
a
great
beer
it
may
be
a

more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
id
highly
reccomend
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
session
stout
its
like
darth
vader
in
a
glass
its
so
dark
the
off
white
head
dies
a
bit
wuickly
though
i
get
chocolate
in
the
nose
along
with
coffee
cream
peanut
butter
molasses
and
a
slight
burnt
rubber
lurking
in
the
background
when
i
taste
it
i
am
overwhelmed
by
a
coffee
ice
cream
flavor
accomanied
by
chocolate
and
nuts
truly
wonderful
flavors
this
feels
smooth
and
slightly
bubbly
in
the
mouth
and
is
as
drinkable
as
any
stout
nice
balance
of
semidense
darker
offwhite
head
with
nice
belgian
lacing
as
the
head
subsides
the
beer
appears
nearly
pitch
black
but
the
lighting
here
is
around
sunset
mmm
i
nice
slightly
sweet
milk
stout
with
some
depth
i
great
balanced
beer
for
the
style
with
tendencies
towards
a
slightly
more
bitter
complex
stout
with
the
light
sweetness
of
a
milk
stout
visually
impressive
sweet
and
malty
at
first
then
meaty
and
satly
and
dry
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
i
love
it
i
will
have
to
have
another
one
of
these
big
black
bastards
again
soon
to
really
experience
all
that
is
happining
in
this
exceptional
beer
an
excellent
brew
notes
this
was
a
relatively
old
bottle
so
the
sweetness
may
have
died
a
bit
as
opposed
to
fresher
bottlings
ive
had
but
it
seemed
less
aggressive
overall
not
bad
for
a
lighter
stout
sweetness
doesent
get
out
of
hand
in
this
balanced
milk
stout
very
drinkable
as
a
dessert
beer
or
change
of
pace
notes
wow
simply
amazing
beer
at
the
time
of
this
review
it
is
my
favorite
stout
of
any
kind
every
sip
was
like
yelling
into
a
canyon
where
there
is
the
initial
flavor
but
there
were
echoes
that
followed
resonating
each
emphasizing
a
different
flavor
d
i
dont
think
that
i
could
make
this
one
a
session
beer
but
it
is
still
very
good
and
would
make
a
great
apeterif
or
dessert
beer
taste
is
more
sweet
than
anything
molasses
chocolate
a
little
caramel
a
surprisingly
nice
blend
without
being
syrupy
finishes
on
the
drier
side
which
i
didnt
expect
but
made
for
a
nice
composition
overall
pours
midnight
black
and
totally
opaque
creamy
brown
onefinger
head
shows
poor
retention
and
worse
lacing
roasted
barley
and
molasses
in
the
nose
with
a
plum
aroma
in
the
background
but
overall
not
a
very
strong
aroma
sweet
roasted
barley
and
dextrins
upfront
raisin
flavor
comes
on
later
but
again
a
milder
taste
hidden
english
hops
dry
out
the
aftertaste
for
a
good
balance
and
just
enough
lingering
molasses
flavor
finishes
mostly
dry
with
only
a
slight
residual
sweetness
the
flavor
is
pleasently
complex
but
it
also
tastes
watered
down
this
would
be
great
if
the
body
were
not
so
light
nad
the
carbonation
no
so
crisp
on
the
other
hand
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
an
interesting
flavor
pours
to
a
opaque
very
dark
brown
without
much
head
smells
very
chocolatey
taste
is
lighter
than
expected
for
appearance
it
has
a
toasted
malt
start
going
into
a
semisweet
chocolatey
finish
without
much
of
any
bitterness
throughout
carbonation
is
good
despite
the
lack
of
head
a
very
delicious
brew
for
my
money
much
better
tasting
than
the
most
popular
stout
that
is
out
there
i
used
to
drink
alot
of
this
stuff
early
in
my
beer
explorations
say
1993
or
94
but
strayed
from
it
long
ago
heres
proof
that
it
still
belongs
in
my
regular
rotaion
still
holds
up
many
quadrupels
imperial
stouts
and
double
ipas
later
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
brews
you
can
get
em
for
about
a
buck
each
so
i
keep
some
on
hand
all
of
the
time
i
drank
this
out
of
a
tumbler
with
very
good
results
pours
with
a
thick
dark
head
very
distinctive
smell
like
roasted
coffee
beans
the
taste
confirms
the
roasted
dark
chocolate
but
it
was
perhaps
a
little
too
much
for
my
tastes
the
strong
milk
taste
was
also
a
little
more
than
i
like
but
thats
all
personal
preference
so
im
trying
to
be
objective
mouthfeel
is
awesome
full
luscious
and
smooth
well
done
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
one
smells
hoppy
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruit
like
berries
taste
is
like
a
sweet
wine
mixed
with
a
beer
with
a
burnt
aftertaste
this
is
super
interesting
nothing
else
like
it
gets
sweeter
as
you
drink
not
super
smooth
almost
carbonated
like
a
wine
cooler
the
mouthfeel
starts
as
a
beer
and
moves
toward
wine
cooler
i
could
drink
these
for
a
bit
but
i
would
always
want
to
go
back
to
a
thick
darker
stout
i
highly
recommend
this
just
for
a
change
of
pace
and
something
different
anything
new
that
can
expand
your
palette
is
worth
trying
enjoy
a
very
tasty
treat
indeed
a
little
too
high
in
rs
compared
to
mouthfeel
for
my
liking
albeit
delicious
this
pours
a
ink
black
color
with
a
beautiful
chocolate
tan
head
i
would
have
given
this
a
5but
the
head
disappears
alittle
too
quickly
the
smell
is
a
sweet
dark
fruit
aroma
with
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
sweet
with
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
not
bad
but
alittle
on
the
light
and
watery
side
the
mf
is
light
and
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
this
is
still
a
quality
beer
that
should
be
tried
light
alcohol
nice
stout
i
was
rather
surprised
that
boston
beer
company
sam
adams
brews
this
although
that
might
explain
why
it
tends
to
be
fairly
low
in
price
for
such
a
high
quality
distribution
batch
size
not
that
sam
adams
necessarily
fits
the
previous
description
considering
its
price
this
beer
is
a
clear
winner
if
you
have
a
friend
who
is
afraid
of
stouts
or
if
you
do
then
this
is
the
beer
to
go
with
absolutely
delicious
and
irresistible
to
the
tongue
properly
consumed
in
generous
helpings
thanks
to
jabocu
for
the
trade
all
in
all
a
very
appealing
beer
and
theres
a
bodega
down
the
street
that
carries
this
stuff
along
with
dragon
stout
and
some
strange
shandies
ill
get
it
again
without
a
doubt
the
sweetness
might
cut
back
on
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
if
anything
the
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
keeps
this
in
check
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
it
is
definitely
a
hallmark
of
the
sweet
stout
style
even
though
i
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
all
that
aside
i
am
sure
that
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
as
not
many
can
compare
to
its
flavor
sometimes
you
want
something
different
which
is
why
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
right
now
this
brew
pours
a
motor
oil
black
color
the
head
is
twofingers
in
height
brown
in
color
and
creamy
in
texture
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
butter
graham
crackers
and
has
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
amazing
everything
from
the
aroma
is
present
with
the
addition
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
encountered
from
a
bottled
beer
mediumfull
bodied
with
low
carbonation
but
oh
so
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
tasted
and
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
having
tried
it
sooner
not
my
favorite
style
but
tasty
nevertheless
pretty
damn
sweet
and
thats
the
way
it
should
be
i
suppose
i
cant
end
this
review
without
mentioning
that
im
constantly
amazed
at
the
cheap
price
on
this
beer
i
can
pick
up
a
6
pack
for
5
50
locally
whereas
guinness
runs
closer
to
7
for
a
far
inferior
beer
in
my
opinion
mackesons
is
so
good
so
drinkable
and
so
cheap
that
its
in
endless
rotation
in
my
beer
stash
and
should
probably
be
in
yours
there
is
really
no
excuse
for
not
trying
it
drinkability
this
is
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
recommend
drinking
this
except
at
room
temperature
pours
a
opaque
black
with
a
thick
orangetan
cap
the
cap
dissipated
through
caverns
to
a
cap
that
rested
on
top
left
belgian
lacings
up
sides
of
glass
smell
is
of
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
nutty
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
hint
of
alcohol
on
nose
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
chocolate
nuttiness
and
coffee
finishes
with
a
light
oily
and
citrus
hops
to
mellow
it
out
a
little
bitterness
hangs
in
the
back
for
a
few
seconds
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
easy
going
down
and
could
finish
several
in
a
sitting
black
looks
fantastic
caramel
colored
head
strong
coffeecream
odor
sweet
chocolately
flavor
almost
like
drinking
a
chocolate
milk
beer
some
smokiness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
even
thinner
than
i
remember
from
my
last
mackeson
but
whatever
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
its
super
good
and
around
here
its
super
cheap
too
solid
and
impenatrably
black
this
liquid
is
topped
with
a
decent
lightbrown
head
notably
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
composed
of
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
roast
grain
theres
coffee
and
caramel
smells
with
a
little
breadyness
as
well
thick
oily
and
a
quite
sweet
the
sweetness
isnt
as
well
balanced
either
with
hop
bitterness
or
burnt
flavors
as
id
hoped
its
satisfying
and
good
but
not
a
standout
decided
to
edit
this
one
rather
that
posting
a
new
review
lots
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
kind
of
like
dark
preserved
fruits
still
the
most
excellent
beer
i
have
tried
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
standing
in
the
glass
the
body
is
jet
black
with
a
dark
brown
rocky
head
smells
sweet
and
nutty
caramel
and
oatmeal
barely
a
whiff
of
roast
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
rich
syrupy
body
and
still
low
on
the
roast
frankly
i
might
call
this
more
of
a
milk
porter
the
roast
flavor
is
so
low
its
just
that
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
there
that
said
its
tasty
thicker
and
sweeter
than
the
platonic
form
of
a
session
beer
even
a
stout
id
probably
have
a
couple
after
skiing
or
something
but
otherwise
no
more
than
one
its
thick
and
sticky
but
goes
down
easy
carbonation
is
mild
but
enough
to
give
a
little
tingle
on
the
lips
and
tongue
surprisingly
easy
to
put
this
one
away
at
one
time
this
was
one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
now
i
find
it
a
little
too
sweet
i
seem
to
remember
it
as
being
a
little
fuller
in
chocolate
and
roast
flavor
this
seems
slightly
one
dimensional
but
still
a
very
fine
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
too
sweet
to
make
a
session
brew
good
intro
sweet
stout
overall
very
nice
a
good
example
of
style
but
in
general
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
personally
drinkability
just
an
outstanding
beer
i
purchased
a
single
on
a
whim
i
will
have
to
get
at
least
another
six
pack
i
could
easily
sit
back
an
enjoy
these
all
night
until
my
belly
was
full
pours
a
jet
black
viscous
brew
with
a
hefty
dark
brown
head
that
retains
well
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
malts
cream
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
only
medium
incredibly
sweet
somewhat
watery
but
the
roasted
flavors
are
particularly
dominant
an
incredible
milk
stout
very
refreshing
in
a
way
that
these
stouts
can
be
i
imagine
this
makes
an
excellent
partner
to
some
mocha
icecream
and
brownie
mmmm
it
pours
out
a
deep
dark
black
tone
with
a
cloudy
thick
head
it
has
a
very
chocolately
taste
there
is
a
slight
coffee
taste
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
smooth
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
not
too
many
at
a
time
that
might
be
to
much
chocolate
pours
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
very
sweet
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
it
tastes
like
dessert
dark
chocolate
coffee
it
tastes
like
chocolate
milk
so
thick
too
like
whole
milk
leaves
the
mouth
and
lips
very
sticky
the
only
drawback
is
this
is
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
pairs
great
with
a
chocolately
dessert
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
quality
stout
i
just
dont
love
it
benjamin
franklin
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
and
takes
charge
this
is
a
compliment
as
it
is
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
or
thick
just
right
just
a
touch
of
charcoal
in
the
background
chocolate
is
mellow
milksweet
stout
you
bet
this
one
kicks
ass
as
the
style
says
this
has
a
milky
smooth
taste
and
feel
to
it
so
cheap
too
i
still
cant
figure
out
how
they
can
make
such
a
fine
beer
and
ship
it
across
the
pond
and
still
sell
it
for
under
7
bucks
a
sixer
unbeleivable
interesting
enough
to
make
a
night
of
it
if
you
know
what
i
mean
about
the
flavor
of
cocoa
in
good
coffee
not
mocha
thats
what
we
have
here
i
recommend
you
try
it
out
if
obvious
chocolate
character
and
sweetness
is
not
interesting
to
you
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
just
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
give
it
a
few
minutes
to
warm
up
and
release
some
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
great
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
especially
for
a
stout
dark
dark
dark
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
darkest
beers
out
there
it
poured
black
very
black
w
an
extreme
head
that
was
tan
i
almost
gave
it
a
5
bc
its
a
good
looking
drink
the
head
lasted
through
much
of
the
drink
and
then
finally
died
down
to
a
light
froth
on
the
surface
there
is
alot
of
chocolate
nut
flavor
to
this
almost
too
sweet
but
not
a
bad
change
its
got
a
good
feel
and
i
can
handle
drinking
a
couple
of
these
but
its
not
something
i
would
drink
as
an
all
the
time
beer
drinkability
a
excellent
choice
for
a
lowabv
goto
stout
dincredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
put
down
the
low
abv
makes
this
an
awesome
session
beer
i
couldnt
drink
these
types
of
stouts
everyday
personal
preference
but
it
is
wonderfully
enjoyable
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
taste
like
a
traditional
english
stout
which
i
dont
particularly
care
for
however
it
was
more
mild
and
drinkable
it
could
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
is
made
in
ohio
but
you
could
definitely
have
2
or
3
of
these
and
not
feel
overwhelmed
by
it
drinkability
when
you
feel
a
craving
for
chocolate
but
want
to
drink
a
beer
try
this
one
and
satisfy
both
cravings
at
once
drinkability
very
affordable
78six
pack
and
would
make
for
a
nice
session
milk
stout
good
thing
i
got
one
more
left
very
good
beer
made
in
good
ol
cincinnati
oh
a
fantastic
sweet
stout
and
one
that
ranks
right
up
there
at
the
top
of
my
list
the
good
price
on
this
one
and
the
bold
flavor
make
damn
sure
you
wont
regret
trying
it
in
fact
youll
probably
keep
going
back
for
more
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
with
no
date
on
the
bottle
a
large
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
black
body
but
soon
fades
to
a
very
thin
cap
leaving
a
nice
bit
of
lace
behind
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
with
a
large
dose
of
cocoa
dominate
my
tastebuds
hops
are
almost
an
after
thought
very
sweet
finish
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
that
a
pint
or
so
d
good
but
nothing
special
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
and
very
creamy
head
it
had
a
very
strong
unsweetened
chocolate
aroma
it
was
very
strong
tasting
full
bodied
and
heavy
very
bitter
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
this
beer
was
very
filling
and
rather
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
actually
midbodied
and
creamy
could
i
drink
this
all
night
long
i
doubt
it
but
for
a
fricken
triple
milk
stout
its
ridiculously
smooth
drinkability
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
a
great
beer
smooth
tasty
what
more
could
you
want
although
im
not
a
huge
stout
drinker
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
bold
full
and
tasty
just
the
right
balance
of
malt
and
sweetness
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
sample
for
one
or
drink
a
few
the
taste
profile
is
again
heavy
in
molasses
with
a
light
coffee
note
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
it
is
barely
noticeable
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
would
recommend
this
with
a
chocolate
desert
of
some
kind
perhaps
a
chocolate
cherry
cake
would
go
down
nicely
drinkability
exceptionally
drinkable
especially
for
4
99
a
sixpack
at
trader
joes
ill
deftinitely
buy
this
one
again
pours
a
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
a
very
good
looking
stoutthe
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
definite
coffee
notes
and
did
i
mention
that
it
smells
sweet
this
is
truly
a
dessert
of
a
beer
its
flavor
is
smooth
and
mellow
it
is
probably
the
milkiest
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
cream

chocolate
and
a
coffee
like

good

you
ask

great
balance
and
the
impressive
look
of
this
brew
make
it
fun
to
drink
there
could
be
a
little
more
depth
to
the
flavor
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
does
what
its
supposed
to
smooth
on
the
intake
creamy
and
milky
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
chocolate
carries
over
well
easily
one
of
my
favorites
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
good
head
with
some
retention
dark
almost
total
black
color
with
no
carbonation
had
a
pretty
good
smell
slightly
sweet
but
still
deep
tones
of
coffee
very
good
taste
especially
as
it
warmed
up
not
as
bitter
as
regular
stouts
and
had
a
nice
aftertaste
stouts
are
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
but
this
one
could
be
a
semiregular
player
overall
excellent
and
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
poured
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
modest
brown
head
that
was
exteremely
attractive
sadly
the
head
quickly
dissapeared
and
was
unable
to
be
revived
smell
is
roasty
coffee
molasses
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
creamy
with
much
caramel
coffee
and
molasses
present
finish
is
slightly
dissapointingn
with
a
bit
too
much
bite
very
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
begins
to
be
overpowering
with
subsequent
sips
yes
this
is
a
good
sweet
stout
yeah
buddy
poured
out
to
a
dark
black
color
with
a
medium
level
of
viscosity
low
carbonation
but
a
nice
14
inch
head
formed
and
calmed
to
a
layer
of
cream
brown
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
fresh
and
fantastic
malts
chocolate
sweet
syrup
and
earth
tones
blend
wonderfully
taste
is
very
good
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
compared
to
the
lead
on
the
aroma
gives
flavors
of
roasted
malts
cocoa
maple
sweet
wood
and
a
touch
of
bready
dough
and
sugar
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
style
but
if
it
had
a
more
chewy
element
this
brew
could
easily
be
the
sweet
stout
to
which
all
others
are
judged
good
drinkability
and
with
the
lower
abv
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
winter
nights
highly
recommended
a
light
brown
frothy
topographical
head
refuses
to
disappear
into
to
the
black
body
the
nose
has
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
creamy
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
chocolate
toffee
and
lactose
the
sweetness
is
nice
and
this
seems
very
quaffable
until
the
last
few
sips
when
much
like
having
a
second
éclair
the
idea
of
another
bottle
is
much
too
much
that
doesnt
mean
the
first
one
wasnt
delicious
a
must
try
for
those
who
like
the
sweet
and
the
dark
pours
deep
chocolate
brown
almost
black
the
tap
was
very
mildly
carbonated
so
the
head
was
nearly
nonexistent
nose
is
sweet
with
very
mild
coffee
hints
reminds
me
of
irish
cream
or
something
taste
is
light
and
creamy
not
your
standard
stout
sweet
not
bitter
dare
i
say
milky
bit
coffeeish
as
well
but
no
bitterness
like
coffee
very
good
smooth
clean
heavy
but
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
very
nice
darn
tasty
but
not
something
you
can
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
on
a
given
night
a
great
sipper
for
after
dinner
on
a
cool
fall
eve
drinkability
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
smooth
yet
robust
with
a
milder
finish
than
i
expected
i
will
begin
buying
this
in
six
packs
instead
of
individual
bottles
highly
chuggable
id
take
this
one
over
youngs
chocolate
anyday
a
nice
milk
stout
can
definitely
drink
this
again
just
one
at
a
time
though
as
the
sweetness
would
start
to
wear
out
its
welcome
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
as
one
might
expect
minimal
carbonation
with
a
chocolate
and
wet
paper
taste
a
good
dessert
beer
smells
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
cherry
tastes
like
a
very
dark
chocolate
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
delicious
a
great
dessert
i
dont
think
milk
stouts
are
meant
to
have
alot
going
on
or
be
overwhelming
with
different
tastes
just
a
welcoming
relaxing
treat
ill
definitely
have
this
again
when
the
time
is
right
despite
my
problems
with
this
beer
it
is
mostly
inoffensive
and
not
so
heavy
that
drinking
a
few
would
present
a
problem
so
long
as
you
can
stand
the
sweetness
notes
one
excellet
stout
this
is
a
quality
brew
but
just
not
my
style
it
is
much
too
sweet
a
nice
tasty
treat
on
a
cool
fall
evening
superb
pour
an
impressive
black
body
with
a
impressive
brown
head
nice
lacing
deep
chocky
aroma
and
taste
a
heavy
anise
flavor
bubbled
up
at
the
finish
kind
of
a
medium
body
for
a
xxx
stout
dry
and
powdery
in
the
mouth
thinned
a
little
towards
the
end
but
still
a
bittersweet
drinking
winner
drinkable
has
its
moments
particularly
the
first
few
sips
and
the
generally
pleasant
mouthfeel
for
reasons
unknown
to
my
meager
mind
this
was
my
first
taste
of
this
ale
after
all
my
years
of
imbibement
and
now
it
has
catapulted
straight
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
dont
be
as
dumb
as
i
was
grab
a
6pack
and
have
a
wonderful
time
wow
this
is
fine
pours
nearly
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
fades
faster
than
id
like
but
the
pour
is
thick
and
substantial
youre
already
enjoying
the
beer
at
this
point
there
is
no
apparent
yeast
residue
here
a
pleasant
and
complex
nose
greets
you
primary
scent
is
of
sorghum
but
a
toasted
malt
is
obviously
evident
taste
is
excellent
malt
sorghum
and
toasted
coffee
dominates
with
an
obvious
chocolate
flavor
as
well
mouth
is
great
with
a
nice
semicreamy
feel
finish
is
again
maltcoffeechocolate
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
again
i
must
rate
this
a
superior
stout
beer
and
highly
recommended
tastes
lightly
roasted
with
the
milk
sugar
sweetness
dominating
over
all
not
too
complex
but
very
drinkable
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
and
smooth
flavor
well
i
had
a
lovehate
with
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
it
was
so
smooth
and
light
but
it
left
an
after
feel
if
you
will
of
swallowing
jello
or
pork
fat
still
it
ws
a
drinkable
beer
just
weird
it
pours
brown
black
with
a
chunky
brown
head
that
falls
to
nothing
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
initially
is
inviting
chocolate
sweet
roastyness
but
it
dies
down
and
becomes
less
noticable
the
taste
was
quite
nice
if
a
little
too
sweet
chocolate
roasted
blended
with
lactic
sugar
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
light
tan
rocky
head
with
cream
colored
hightlights
deep
reddishbrown
liquid
roasty
nose
with
a
faint
molasses
sweetness
under
the
roastiness
with
a
chocolate
hint
as
well
somewhat
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
with
flavors
of
malty
sweetness
and
light
chocolate
finishes
with
a
light
lactic
sourness
after
all
is
said
and
done
overall
i
was
never
even
interested
in
this
beer
until
hearing
today
that
it
was
the
most
underrated
stout
in
the
world
ok
i
personally
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
but
for
only
1
49
a
single
this
is
an
excellent
milk
stout
a
6er
would
be
an
inexpensive
treat
pretty
good
in
the
bottle
but
on
tap
is
a
bit
better
thats
how
we
had
it
in
london
this
june
in
a
pub
about
6
miles
from
the
brewery
at
about
7
for
a
pint
compare
that
to
6
99
for
a
sixpack
at
wilburs
in
ft
collins
co
and
it
seems
pretty
darn
reasonable
even
if
the
stuff
sold
in
the
usa
is
now
made
at
the
old
hudepohl
brewery
in
cincinnati
its
almost
as
good
as
the
original
stuff
and
for
the
price
definitely
worth
it
btw
we
also
found
this
in
bottles
in
london
about
17
for
a
6
pack
we
passed
theres
nothing
spectacular
in
it
but
its
still
a
great
beer
lovely
taste
and
feel
goes
well
with
desserts
recommended
for
anyone
that
likes
their
beer
a
little
thicker
and
sweeter
such
a
beautiful
beer
for
when
you
want
the
flavor
of
a
serious
stout
but
without
the
agressiveness
or
harshness
the
perfect
black
nearly
opaque
colors
dainty
tan
head
that
laced
really
well
soft
roasted
and
sweet
aromas
with
slight
lactic
tones
tastes
highly
malty
and
silky
smooth
syrupy
texture
holds
soft
flavors
of
coffee
cocoa
roastiness
breadiness
and
cream
lactic
acids
provide
slight
souring
but
not
offputting
hops
balances
against
the
sweetness
but
adds
no
flavor
aroma
or
obvious
bittering
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
quicker
than
one
might
think
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
halfinch
of
offwhite
foam
and
an
aroma
of
coffee
with
cream
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
wonderful
chocolate
malt
flavors
punctuated
by
a
creamy
sweetness
what
follows
these
flavors
is
slight
tartness
a
hint
of
molasses
and
a
coffeeish
finish
that
is
surprisingly
dry
this
is
a
wonderfully
smooth
and
drinkable
stout
id
drink
this
instead
of
coffee
or
irish
breakfast
tea
if
it
had
caffeine
good
stuff
although
this
is
brewed
in
cincinatti
this
still
drinks
like
a
true
english
milk
stout
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
cheers
this
is
the
best
desert
beer
ive
ever
drank
it
would
be
great
with
just
about
any
sweet
food
you
can
think
of
pours
midnight
black
with
a
foamy
chocolate
milk
colored
head
about
an
index
finger
thick
the
head
doesnt
last
long
settles
quickly
into
a
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
nestles
quik
chocolate
syrup
more
than
anything
else
taste
is
unexpectedly
light
for
a
stout
and
again
dominated
by
choclate
sweet
tasting
the
sweetness
almost
completely
obscures
any
stoutlike
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
creaminess
i
can
only
liken
this
to
drinking
choclate
milk
with
a
head
on
it
not
bad
at
all
its
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
its
almost
dessertlike
id
have
it
again
but
more
as
an
after
dinner
sipper
than
an
after
work
drink
this
is
the
first
sweet
stout
ive
ever
had
so
i
cant
rate
it
relative
to
its
inclass
competitors
based
on
beer
in
general
though
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
its
literally
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
it
looks
like
it
came
from
starbucks
doesnt
really
smell
like
much
the
taste
isnt
so
much
sweet
as
it
is
alcoholic
even
though
the
apv
isnt
very
high
the
stout
body
and
milky
sweetness
combine
to
give
it
a
distinct
rum
flavor
other
reviews
say
that
this
beer
is
too
sweet
but
i
disagree
i
think
it
is
extremely
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
exactly
sweetjust
not
bitter
and
acrid
aftertaste
is
a
bit
more
roasty
as
the
stout
shines
through
i
must
say
that
id
prefer
a
regular
stout
this
just
tastes
weird
not
quite
as
much
depth
as
beamish
reminds
me
of
wexford
cream
ale
must
be
the
lactose
not
too
shabby
at
all
this
aged
bottle
opens
to
a
big
smell
of
molasses
coffee
and
chicory
pours
the
darkest
brown
head
ive
seen
which
thins
away
quickly
a
slight
lactic
sourness
not
a
prominent
as
a
caffreys
lends
an
orangey
chracter
an
astringent
espresso
roast
flavor
add
to
bitterness
for
its
own
sake
but
toward
the
finish
it
mellows
out
and
leaves
you
with
an
impression
of
rum
general
comments
i
am
a
stout
lover
so
i
have
a
bit
of
a
bias
going
into
this
description
this
by
far
ranks
in
my
top
5
of
stouts
ive
only
had
this
in
a
can
and
tapped
i
could
only
imagine
a
more
wonderful
experience
overall
a
good
beer
certainly
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
ive
had
edit
6252005
i
bought
another
sixpack
of
these
and
tried
them
again
last
night
and
found
that
many
of
my
earlier
caveats
about
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
unfounded
this
beer
is
good
at
virtually
any
temperature
range
and
even
when
i
had
one
at
nearly
room
temperature
it
went
down
smooth
and
clean
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
have
upped
the
drinkability
to
5
and
the
mouthfeel
to
4
5
to
better
reflect
what
my
more
sophisticated
palate
tells
me
about
this
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
thanks
to
all
who
recommended
it
to
me
overall
a
great
beer
try
or
one
to
fall
back
on
i
think
it
is
one
you
need
to
drink
when
in
the
mood
but
it
is
a
good
one
to
have
thumbs
up
picked
this
up
in
the
bargain
bin
at
sams
but
i
dont
think
its
suffered
too
much
pours
a
deep
almost
pitch
black
through
which
almost
no
light
can
pass
a
smallish
creamy
deep
brown
head
tops
the
body
strong
aroma
of
coffee
grounds
chocolate
and
rich
roasted
malt
beautiful
creamy
body
no
doubt
due
in
part
to
the
lactose
palate
is
redolent
of
sweet
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
chicory
the
slightest
touch
of
root
vegetable
and
a
hint
of
a
metallic
tinge
throughout
allaround
a
nice
rich
stout
with
a
wonderful
body
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
light
brown
head
smells
of
malt
and
alcohol
and
an
interesting
earthy
almost
herbal
note
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
never
had
a
sweet
stout
before
so
the
sweetness
kind
of
took
me
by
surprise
first
to
the
palate
is
a
flash
of
acrid
black
patent
malt
quickly
taken
up
by
rich
roasted
barley
and
mocha
then
the
creamy
lactose
taste
comes
in
like
coffee
with
lots
of
creamer
even
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
very
end
pretty
clean
finish
with
a
little
coffee
in
it
mouthfeel
is
milky
creamy
and
malty
smooth
helped
along
by
healthy
carbonation
man
this
is
one
easy
drinking
stout
i
wish
this
was
the
standard
dark
beer
offered
in
bars
instead
of
guinness
i
could
definitely
stand
for
several
of
these
when
going
out
sampled
last
evening
while
out
the
beer
poured
a
deep
deep
brwon
to
black
with
only
slight
hues
of
dark
ruby
that
came
through
there
was
a
nice
2
finger
tan
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
very
nice
with
a
dominant
sweet
and
creamy
chocolate
the
flavor
was
right
at
what
i
expect
a
milk
stout
to
be
sweet
and
creamy
and
chocolatey
not
a
lot
of
marshmallowy
character
but
enough
to
let
me
know
there
is
a
little
there
well
done
the
feel
was
thick
and
creamy
very
drinkable
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
i
like
the
balance
between
extreme
and
not
enough
in
the
flavor
and
nose
overall
impression
despite
my
initial
trepidation
to
learn
this
english
beer
came
from
ohio
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
style
that
not
many
brewers
seem
to
tackle
quite
enjoyable
and
suited
to
many
different
occasions
i
feel
the
quality
of
this
beer
has
significantly
diminished
since
being
brewed
in
cincinati
i
remember
buying
this
in
bottle
5
yrs
ago
and
it
had
the
traditional
3
man
pyramid
but
with
fla
printed
beneath
the
logo
hmmm
i
have
no
desire
to
try
this
in
bottles
again
i
thought
this
stuff
was
a
little
low
in
price
for
an
import
then
i
read
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
that
it
was
brewed
in
the
good
ole
usa
oh
well
its
still
a
quality
brew
triple
x
is
almost
black
in
color
head
is
mediumsized
creamy
and
brown
the
smell
is
of
rich
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
taste
is
more
of
the
same
lightly
bitter
and
rich
of
chocolate
roasted
coffee
taste
is
mainly
noted
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
beer
as
a
whole
this
is
great
stuff
and
as
a
plus
is
a
couple
bucks
cheaper
than
most
of
its
competion
this
ale
is
impressive
and
quite
interesting
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
1inch
tan
head
that
remains
a
thin
lid
on
the
ale
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
but
not
much
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
but
its
got
a
distinct
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
completely
belies
the
appearance
of
this
ale
it
looks
heavy
and
bitter
but
the
taste
while
stout
is
a
bit
sweet
with
the
lactose
completely
smoothing
everything
out
there
is
a
strong
carameltoffee
taste
over
the
deep
roast
flavor
with
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
and
a
bit
of
plum
and
raisin
the
yeast
is
barely
evident
the
moutfeel
is
oily
but
smooth
and
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
could
be
rated
a
4
5
it
is
not
so
drinkable
because
it
is
so
sweet
almost
a
dessert
beer
tastes
like
dessert
in
beer
form
a
solid
milk
stout
notes
who
cares
if
its
made
in
cincinnati
oh
its
still
very
good
very
sweet
has
a
great
slick
mouthfeel
but
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
great
dessert
beer
this
beer
pours
out
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
lactose
the
flavor
is
a
great
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
a
roasted
bitterness
creamy
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
sweetness
one
of
these
is
plenty
enough
for
me
still
this
is
an
interesting
and
all
around
good
stout
its
been
several
years
since
i
had
one
of
these
i
dont
know
why
i
waited
so
long
heavy
on
the
palate
but
not
thick
and
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
a
meal
or
alone
one
i
will
have
again
and
one
i
am
very
glad
i
tried
drinkability
low
abv
mild
flavor
and
inexpensive
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
my
favorite
mundane
stout
poured
a
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
soon
fell
into
a
film
and
left
some
lacing
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
but
just
a
bit
too
weak
the
taste
is
of
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
with
just
a
trace
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
that
i
will
be
keeping
this
in
stock
regularly
in
my
home
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
jet
black
color
with
three
fingers
of
dark
caramel
foam
there
is
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
chocolate
hiding
under
the
rich
roasted
malts
all
wondeful
aromas
that
really
leap
out
of
the
glass
at
you
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
very
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
roasted
almond
very
sweet
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
a
milk
stout
at
4
9
abv
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
brew
for
those
who
like
stouts
and
a
very
good
example
of
a
sweet
stout
ontap
pint
served
from
old
chicago
in
iowa
city
iowa
in
january
2005

tastes

creamy
smooth
with
a
mild

waves
remian
on

the
beer
level
was
after

medium
bodied
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
received
this
bottle
as
a
part
of
a
beers
of
the
world
8pack
mixed
in
with
a
bunch
of
mediocre
lagers
and
this
was
the
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
a
great
surprise
ill
be
picking
up
a
sixpack
soon
drinkability
perfect
for
a
winter
warmmeup
i
was
very
eager
to
try
this
as
i
was
told
by
a
source
that
i
trust
quite
a
bit
that
i
would
enjoy
it
this
beer
looks
excellent
however
i
felt
that
it
just
didnt
taste
the
way
that
i
would
have
liked
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
almost
to
much
going
on
in
my
mouth
the
chocolate
seemed
to
almost
get
in
the
way
of
the
natural
taste
of
the
beer
if
i
were
ever
given
a
glass
of
this
i
would
most
definately
drink
it
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
be
buying
it
any
time
soon
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
with
sweet
malt
hints
of
coffee
a
dessert
beer
almost
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
pours
out
black
as
night
ink
etc
but
little
or
no
head
at
all
what
little
there
was
might
have
been
dark
beige
to
brown
and
just
hung
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
was
quite
light
for
a
stout
there
was
a
light
sweet
malty
aroma
the
flavor
starts
with
anice
sharp
coffee
character
then
slides
into
a
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
and
roasted
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
it
starts
to
develop
a
plumy
sweetness
aroma
is
roast
and
malty
inviting
an
excellent
wonderful
beer
the
only
downfall
might
be
that
i
suspect
its
a
little
too
thick
and
intense
to
be
as
drinkable
as
a
lighter
beer
one
of
these
is
probably
enough
for
a
night
but
would
make
an
excellent
accompanyment
to
a
chocolate
desert
first
swig
is
smooth
and
coats
my
mouth
cocoa
and
coffee
definitely
hit
you
especially
after
it
goes
down
i
definitely
like
the
taste
of
this
stout
but
worry
that
the
coffeecocoa
flavor
could
get
a
little
overwhelming
it
is
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
though
the
bite
is
there
without
it
losing
the
smoothness
for
a
stout
i
like
it
but
in
my
book
it
is
still
a
stout
and
will
never
be
my
preference
a
damn
good
stout
toasty
rather
than
roasty
with
sugar
yet
not
too
sweet
licorice
aroma
bit
of
grain
smooth
clean
without
the
heaviness
oil
or
bitterness
of
other
stouts
understated
carbonation
chocolate
toffe
and
coffee
works
satisfying
balanced
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
those
who
think
all
dark
beers
are
bitter
unfortunately
i
didnt
notice
that
this
was
a
milk
stout
when
i
bought
a
six
pack
i
was
initially
impressed
with
how
well
the
beer
looked
in
my
glass
with
its
head
color
with
that
in
mind
i
proceeded
to
enjoy
errr
stop
right
there
this
wasnt
enjoyable
at
all
this
beer
is
so
sickishly
sweet
that
i
could
only
drink
one
bottle
although
i
tried
on
four
occassions
to
drink
additional
bottles
of
it
i
ended
up
with
just
a
few
tastes
before
i
had
to
throw
each
bottle
out
so
this
is
definitely
not
an
acquired
taste
i
assume
that
this
type
of
beer
is
geared
toward
those
who
dont
like
beer
and
want
the
taste
masked
by
gross
sweetness
i
grabbed
a
12oz
single
of
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
ive
been
meaning
to
try
it
for
awhile
but
didnt
want
to
commit
to
a
full
sixpack
the
body
of
the
beer
pours
out
a
nice
solid
black
that
reveals
rubyred
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
is
tan
nice
and
clumpy
with
good
retention
the
nose
is
nice
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruits
like
plums
i
also
pick
up
some
berries
and
roasted
coffee
wow
first
thing
that
jumps
out
at
me
is
how
creamy
the
mouthfeel
isits
nice
and
fluffy
but
still
goes
down
rather
slickly
in
the
flavor
i
get
a
nice
bitter
roasty
malt
and
a
puff
of
smoke
as
well
the
dark
fruit
and
berry
flavors
are
there
and
i
can
make
out
a
thin
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
tends
to
thin
out
as
the
head
dissipates
this
beer
is
quenching
and
at
under
5
abv
it
practically
jumps
into
the
session
stout
category
i
just
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
frothy
cappuccino
head
that
produces
some
moederate
lacing
inside
the
glass
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
vanilla
oatmeal
chocolate
and
charcoal
the
flavor
of
this
is
exceptional
but
really
shines
through
when
it
is
served
at
just
below
or
at
room
temperature
the
tanginess
from
the
lactose
is
apparent
up
front
but
not
overpowering
and
it
quickly
mingles
with
a
sweet
burnt
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
at
4
90
abv
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
stout
just
great
pours
opaquely
black
with
a
medium
brown
fluffy
head
aromas
are
mostly
of
scorched
toasted
malts
and
a
marshmallowy
syntheticlike
like
sweetness
mostly
thick
and
malty
with
some
slight
lactic
tartness
nearer
the
finish
feels
thin
but
with
adequate
flavor
there
are
better
examples
of
good
milk
stout
out
there
pours
with
an
initially
respectable
12
head
of
dirty
brown
foam
that
decays
almost
instantly
to
spotty
with

good
flavors
not
a
heavy
stout
at
all
really
enjoyed
this
one
beer
is
good
happy
beering
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
let
me
just
say
this
if
i
were
limited
to
only
one
brand
it
would
probably
be
this
one
this
is
such
a
balanced
and
inviting
brew
that
i
just
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
it
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
one
calls
for
another
and
so
on
excellent
stout
this
appears
an
opaque
black
with
a
head
that
sky
rocketed
up
to
a
little
above
the
glass
and
was
a
nice
dark
tan
color
good
retention
on
the
head
as
it
collapsed
into
a
rocky
landscape
and
sheets
of
lacing
were
left
as
this
was
drank
the
scents
of
dark
chocolate
cream
and
roasted
malt
make
up
the
majority
of
the
nose
and
it
is
quite
appetizing
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
hit
the
palette
first
with
this
as
a
creamy
taste
comes
in
after
with
a
nice
sweetness
there
are
notes
of
espresso
in
this
and
it
ends
with
a
nice
bittersweet
finish
while
having
a
nice
silky
feel
in
the
mouth
the
body
seemed
a
bit
thinner
than
it
should
have
been
great
drinkability
as
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
and
the
balancing
bitter
flavor
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
this
wonderful
stout
by
far
the
best
milk
stout
i
have
ever
had
good
drinkablility
starts
tasting
a
bit
sweeter
after
two
or
three
bottles
i
would
have
given
it
higher
on
drinkability
but
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
down
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
in
one
sitting
the
flavor
is
just
so
intense
super
drinkable
brew
with
a
delightful
flavor
a
great
beer
for
those
afraid
of
dark
beer
surprisingly
good
worth
a
try
imagine
what
a
perfect
stout
looks
like
when
poured
mackeson
will
fit
that
imagination
now
imagine
the
perfect
stout
aroma
again
mackeson
fits
the
bill
it
goes
down
buttery
smooth
definately
sweet
but
not
overpowering
personally
i
dont
like
really
sweet
beers
but
this
is
the
best
sweet
stout
ive
had
still
not
a
session
beer
for
me
more
of
a
dessert
beer
a
couple
of
these
and
i
need
to
switch
to
something
less
cloying
what
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
the
original
version
from
england
this
strikes
me
as
an
excellent
beer
for
newbies
trying
out
dark
beers
good
flavor
without
overpowering
bitterness
note
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
or
situation
that
calls
for
a
sweet
beer
drinkability
i
would
not
hesitate
to
order
this
stout
in
a
pub
above
many
other
stouts
very
good
snatched
a
sixer
at
trader
joes
for
5
99
so
that
sounded
like
a
deal
to
me
pours
out
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
oh
snaps
it
smells
lovely
roasted
and
hearty
cocoa
and
coffee
maybe
a
hint
of
maple
velvety
in
the
mouth
smooth
and
silky
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
flavorful
and
upfront
big
chocolate
and
a
nice
sweetness
though
not
overpowering
balanced
with
a
nice
roasty
character
a
touch
nutty
even
overall
a
very
good
stout
that
will
grace
my
fridge
again
another
old
fav
but
this
time
it
stronger
lovelly
beautiful
looking
stout
intense
black
in
colour
mahogany
tints
barely
show
at
the
edge
when
held
to
a
light
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lace
very
sweet
coffee
and
creme
aroma
some
milk
chocolate
wonderful
taste
sweet
fruitiness
black
currant
comes
to
mind
then
its
into
some
creamy
chocolate
and
darker
hints
of
espresso
think
i
can
detect
the
ghost
of
hops
in
the
after
taste
very
nice
on
the
palte
silky
smooth
yet
still
semicarbonated
a
very
nice
stout
and
very
drinkable
this
one
is
better
than
the
original
note
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
if
all
other
beer
production
in
the
world
ceased
but
this
one
i
wouldnt
be
that
upset
poured
black
as
ink
with
a
medium
brown
coloured
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
smell
is
almost
identical
to
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
bit
of
milk
and
chocolate
syrup
absolutely
wonderful
the
taste
as
well
is
quite
strong
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
milk
brilliant
the
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
creamy
and
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
a
most
excellent
stout
indeed
this
is
however
a
bit
heavy
and
quite
filling
but
still
absolutely
amazing
none
the
less
will
buy
again
black
pour
with
a
big
tan
head
creamy
and
foamy
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
milk
aroma
mild
grapey
acidity
on
the
tongue
slight
slice
of
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
smooth
and
quaffable
to
be
sure
but
i
cant
say
i
like
those
milkycreamy
stouts
that
much
the
lactose
make
it
seem
to
me
less
beerlike
than
most
fruit
beers
the
full
body
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
its
almost
still
as
it
is
low
complexity
level
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
very
easy
going
down
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
stout
but
again
i
thought
it
was
too
dry
maybe
i
just
havent
compared
enough
of
these
types
of
stouts
its
definitely
worth
trying
overall
this
brew
was
a
nice
find
for
tjs
inoffensive
and
mellow
with
no
intense
flavors
to
intimidate
those
trying
out
dark
beers
for
the
first
time
this
milk
stout
would
be
ideal
to
use
as
a
introductory
beer
to
initiate
beer
lovers
to
the
world
of
stouts
a
solid
brew
just
a
good
beer
imho
this
is
not
overly
rich
and
sweet
as
some
have
noted
well
balanced
and
nicely
complex
this
fine
stout
finally
turned
up
again
in
my
area
it
had
simply
vanished
for
a
few
years
needless
to
say
i
was
glad
to
be
re
united
it
pours
a
deep
black
and
the
head
is
malted
milk
brown
the
head
retains
fairly
well
and
lacing
is
fair
strong
roasty
aroma
that
is
heavy
on
sweet
malts
taste
profile
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
strong
roasted
notes
and
some
dark
fruit
good
hopping
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
i
think
its
made
in
the
states
now
still
this
old
friend
didnt
let
me
down
a
good
value
at
4
99
a
six
got
this
at
the
local
trader
joes
i
remember
having
this
years
ago
and
the
flavor
was
more
intense
of
course
it
wasnt
made
in
cincinnati
either
nonetheless
at

a
sixer
its
an
outstanding
stout
still
fairly
cheap
easy
to
find
and
quite
tasty
what
else
do
you
need
in
a
stout
when
i
poured
this
stout
i
thought
i
was
pouring
dark
thick
ink
with
a
very
dark
tan
head
that
disapated
with
in
a
minute
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
mixed
with
a
hint
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
was
very
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
like
the
smell
and
aroma
rosted
malts
and
chocolate
a
well
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
best
milk
stout
that
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
all
in
all
a
very
interesting
brew
and
a
great
stout
ill
be
picking
up
this
one
again
for
sure
liked
this
stout
for
years
even
though
its
brewed
in
us
now
it
still
hits
the
spot
good
cream
stout
as
good
as
any
i
have
enjoyed
brew
looks
good
and
dark
nice
smooth
creamy
feel
and
taste
mouthfeel
good
be
heavier
brings
back
old
memories
way
before
i
new
what
a
ba
was
but
enjoyed
good
beer
just
the
same
the
head
is
dark
browntan
noisy
and
doughy
it
leaves
swoops
of
lacing
the
beer
is
dark
black
with
redbrown
highlights
when
held
tight
to
bright
light
a
sweet
sweet
milk
chocolate
nose
hides
some
bitter
cocoa
the
front
is
sweet
toffee
and
milk
sugar
creeps
in
with
chocolate
and
some
butter
in
the
thinnish
middle
the
finish
is
somewhat
bitter
with
tangy
tart
fruit
a
touch
metallic
when
cool
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
i
found
it
a
little
too
sugarywatery
through
the
middle
but
its
very
enjoyable
mackeson
triple
xxx
was
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
definitely
be
buying
it
again
although
i
havent
had
many
milksweet
stouts
before
this
one
seems
to
embody
the
style
as
well
as
or
better
than
any
other
12
ounce
bottle
with
no
dating
pours
black
with
a
dark
tan
puffy
head
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
coffee
notes
medium
body
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
notes
include
sweet
malt
coffee
toffee
light
chocolate
also
some
sugary
burnt
flavors
present
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
stout
worth
seeking
out
an
enjoying
pours
like
used
motor
oil
and
is
nearly
as
black
only
with
garnet
highlights
where
the
light
tries
to
peak
through
even
with
the
attempt
of
a
moderately
gentle
pour
it
still
managed
to
make
a
212
finger
layer
of
tan
dense
foam
beautiful
it
has
a
bold
roasty
malt
aroma
with
underlying
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthwatering
the
taste
is
a
sweet
cocoa
and
bitter
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
hops
and
tapers
to
a
sweet
chocolate
milk
finish
unreal
this
is
a
medium
to
heavy
bodied
brew
that
is
like
silk
classic
i
believe
despite
its
rich
character
i
could
flow
through
these
like
the
wind
wow
did
i
mention
that
this
was
good
cheers
truly
a
fantastic
stout
so
smooth
and
creamy
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
slice
of
cheesecake
and
it
went
beautifully
for
stout
lovers
this
beer
may
disappoint
as
another
reviewer
puts
it
its
dessert
in
a
bottle
but
im
not
sure
that
dessert
is
what
most
beer
connoisseurs
are
looking
for
in
their
drink
the
mouthfeeltexture
is
like
french
silk
pie
silky
and
slick
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
chocolatey
theres
not
enough
bitterness
to
really
make
a
claim
for
coffee
flavors
unless
its
one
of
those
coffee
drinks
or
liquified
sundaes
they
serve
up
at
starbucks
the
aroma
is
promising
it
smells
like
it
could
be
a
rich
but
balanced
stout
yet
without
the
backbone
of
hoppiness
on
the
finish
this
stout
becomes
pretty
monotone
about
half
way
through
id
say
its
a
great
beer
to
suggest
to
nonbeer
lovers
the
kind
of
folks
unfortunately
many
women
i
am
ashamed
to
admit
who
either
get
the
blandest
tasting
mainstream
lite
beer
or
opt
for
a
sweet
cocktail
just
to
remain
part
of
the
crowd
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
almost
gave
the
drinkability
a
5
almost
i
realize
that
is
reserved
for
only
the
highest
quality
and
im
not
sure
when
ill
actually
give
out
a
5
but
i
did
buy
3
cases
of
this
beer
within
this
year
already
so
please
factor
that
into
the
drinkability
tried
and
true
i
love
this
beer
i
found
this
at
the
winking
lizard
columbus
during
my
world
tour
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
out
of
them
so
far
although
this
was
a
dark
and
creamy
stout
with
really
great
chocolate
and
coffee
overtones
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sweet
stouts
this
one
was
a
bit
way
to
sweet
for
my
likes
it
has
a
good
bite
though
and
great
dark
appearance
and
head
perhaps
i
will
like
it
a
bit
more
in
the
bottle
but
i
tend
to
perfer
less
sweet
stouts
and
on
tap
for
lovers
of
sweet
stouts
and
milk
stouts
though
you
will
probably
be
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
wont
diss
this
beer
but
its
just
not
my
bag
my
goodness
how
did
i
not
ever
hear
of
this
stuff
for
the
3
years
ive
been
drinking
better
beer
oh
yummy
this
milky
creamy
sweet
indulgent
fluid
its
just
about
opaque
with
a
solid
and
foamy
dark
brown
head
a
nice
and
mellow
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
and
sweetness
helps
it
to
entice
damn
i
love
this
style
of
stout
this
is
no
schlep
in
the
milk
stout
department
a
wonderful
blend
of
chocolate
malts
hops
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
one
drinkable
damn
stout
since
i
love
the
us
brewed
version
so
much
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
native
brewed
stout
if
i
ever
make
it
to
england
if
youre
a
sweet
or
milk
stout
lover
go
try
this
stuff
if
you
havent
yet
picked
this
up
in
a
winter
brew
sampler
from
cost
plus
what
a
gem
this
is
this
black
as
a
coal
mine
brew
poured
a
nice
little
tan
head
that
unfortunately
did
not
hold
the
chocolate
roasted
malts
hit
you
fairly
strong
the
taste
is
a
slice
of
heaven
on
earth
a
wonderful
blend
of
the
chocolate
malts
lactose
sugar
and
hops
this
has
a
moderately
heavy
mouthfeel
but
not
as
heavy
as
this
appears
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
near
perfect
this
is
one
to
seek
out
and
try
if
you
have
not
already
12
ounce
bottle
brewed
in
ohio
to
my
tastebuds
this
one
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
ones
i
had
consumed
from
the
uk
many
years
ago
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
stout
but
its
quickly
become
one
of
my
favourites
mackeson
pours
an
opaque
brownblack
with
a
medium
brown
head
that
isnt
hard
or
sturdy
like
a
guiness
head
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
smoothness
of
flavor
and
finishing
sweetness
the
only
problem
is
this
beer
has
a
tendency
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
my
husband
used
to
love
it
but
got
sick
of
it
it
finishes
with
a
malt
taste
in
which
the
black
patent
malt
is
evident
in
the
subtle
roast
finish
flavor
pours
a
deep
black
color
and
is
topped
by
a
strong
creamy
brown
head
aromas
of
burnt
malt
and
coffee
dominate
the
aroma
a
roasted
burnt
flavor
up
front
which
finishes
with
a
sweetness
mixed
by
an
acidity
from
the
roast
malt
character
it
is
like
a
strong
bitter
coffee
up
front
but
then
finishes
like
a
coffee
with
a
bunch
of
cream
and
sugar
added
the
last
sensation
after
the
beer
has
left
my
mouth
is
an
astringency
from
the
burnt
character
the
sweetness
from
the
lactose
balances
the
strong
roast
burnt
character
which
otherwise
would
overwhelm
this
beer
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
was
expecting
too
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
sweet
and
creamy
with
a
large
amount
of
chocolate
and
black
malts
the
taste
is
great
it
is
extremely
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
chocolate
flavor
this
is
really
good
it
has
a
really
sweet
taste
probably
achieved
by
the
use
of
lactose
an
unfermentable
milk
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
a
fine
beer
at
an
excellent
price
thanks
to
the
brothers
mackeson
pours
a
rich
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
head
dissipated
quickly
but
left
lots
of
remnants
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
semisweet
front
with
rich
malt
middle
and
a
hint
of
roasted
bitterness
on
the
end
very
nice
balance
very
good
beer
drinkability
good
example
of
a
sweet
milk
stout
would
love
to
try
the
european
version
not
very
sweet
when
compared
to
the
daffy
sweetness
fo
the
belgians
considering
this
is
a
sweet
stout
black
liquid
topped
by
a
thin
tan
head
somewhat
standard
stout
looks
dark
roasted
aromas
coupled
with
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
dark
with
hints
of
sweet
cream
highly
roasted
malt
flavors
dominate
lingering
bitter
coffee
notes
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
in
the
terms
of
body
but
very
smooth
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
strong
roasted
aftertaste
makes
it
more
of
a
sipper
sitting
but
after
dinner
a
damn
fine
beer
finish
is
dry
smooth
and
heavy
a
bit
of
creme
andor
chocolate
flavor
remains
on
your
tongue
long
after
the
beer
has
gone
this
stout
also
tends
to
sit
in
your
stomach
too
youll
remember
it
for
a
good
while
after
you
toss
the
enpty
bottle
i
promise
personally
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
stout
but
i
believe
i
prefer
guinness
extra
stout
or
murphys
instead
tough
call
though
black
color
great
head
oustanding
malt
and
coffee
smells
but
no
bitterness
smooth
taste
was
extremely
wellrounded
and
had
smoke
and
coffee
flavors
mouthfeel
was
great
wellrounded
slightly
chewy
just
right
extremely
drinkable
as
close
to
a
5
0
as
they
come
this
is
a
stout
so
of
course
it
pours
out
dark
with
a
choclatey
head
the
taste
is
something
incredible
for
those
of
you
who
have
had
stouts
before
its
actually
not
bitter
it
really
does
have
chocolate
overtones
i
enjoyed
it
though
i
can
see
why
some
would
say
that
its
too
sweet
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
on
a
warm
day
or
if
i
wanted
to
drink
more
than
one
ore
two
but
if
you
have
one
then
kick
back
and
enjoy
if
youve
ever
been
to
ri
you
might
know
that
the
state
drink
is
coffee
milk
yes
coffee
milk
its
essentially
milk
with
sweet
coffee
syrup
just
like
chocolate
syrup
added
thats
exactly
what
the
xxx
stout
tastes
like
beerflavored
slightlycarbonated
coffee
milk
delicious
im
going
to
head
to
bed
soon
and
have
a
feeling
that
ill
sleep
incredibly
well
mmmm
a
fantastic
stout
and
probably
up
amongst
my
favorite
nonimperials
after
a
few
mentions
on
the
site
i
saw
it
at
the
sharp
edge
beer
emporium
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
and
glad
i
was
definitely
one
of
the
ones
ill
be
having
again
overall
good
a
beer
that
i
would
have
one
of
on
occasion
i
would
definitely
drink
it
cold
though
this
was
a
very
good
stout
it
reminded
me
much
of
the
sam
adams
cream
stout
i
could
definitely
have
this
as
a
session
beer
very
rich
and
creamy
and
full
of
creamy
flavor
a
very
good
cream
stout
the
color
was
nice
a
black
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
was
very
coffee
like
with
a
little
bit
of
molasses
and
the
flavor
was
the
same
a
very
good
beer
beer
poured
a
deep
and
dark
brown
from
the
bottle
the
head
was
a
creamy
tan
with
some
ruby
tints
to
it
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
some
sweet
roasted
notes
in
the
aroma
some
chocolate
caramel
and
also
got
some
sweet
cherry
in
there
too
bittersweet
in
flavor
which
grew
as
the
beer
warmed
a
good
room
temperature
beer
or
slightly
chilled
the
body
was
lighter
than
i
expected
but
kept
its
rich
and
semi
sweet
flavor
throughout
the
drink
finished
dry
a
special
stout
but
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
when
poured
this
beer
had
a
small
sized
dark
tan
head
that
contained
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
diminishing
the
body
was
opaque
and
uncarbonated
with
a
dark
brown
hue
the
nose
was
malty
mild
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
this
beer
had
a
smooth
and
very
mild
coffee
flavor
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
somewhat
of
a
thin
and
watery
texture
and
light
bodied
there
was
a
good
amount
of
lacing
with
this
beer
appearance
dark
ruby
almost
black
body
with
a
nice
two
finger
sized
tan
dark
brown
head
the
foam
startst
to
dwindle
leaving
behind
fine
lacing
around
the
glass
that
forms
the
same
way
with
each
sip
aroma
a
sharp
sweetness
arises
with
the
dark
roasts
backing
it
the
lactose
sugar
has
a
sharp
acidic
quality
about
it
in
the
nose
taste
a
great
mix
of
bitter
sweet
the
lactose
milkiness
is
amazing
in
this
brew
that
creamy
sugary
tone
is
upfront
and
i
am
loving
it
like
a
malt
or
milkshake
very
good
then
the
bitter
deep
roasted
barley
tones
come
around
with
the
likes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
very
nice
brew
mouthfeel
a
tad
thinner
than
expected
definitely
lighter
bodied
compared
to
most
stouts
but
this
one
has
that
trademark
whipped
cream
like
sweetness
drinkability
very
dessert
esque
like
a
whipped
cream
i
am
a
fan
i
personally
believe
this
is
the
best
cream
stout
i
have
tasted
in
my
day
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
or
acidic
perfectly
balanced
a
must
try
in
the
realm
of
any
stout
overall
drinkability
suffers
for
sweetness
i
think
i
would
feel
like
a
real
hop
monster
after
this
bev
i
might
rereview
in
the
deep
of
winter
to
maybe
gain
a
better
perspective

amazing

is
a

roasted

caramel
creamy

just
a

the

said
it
tasted
like
chocolate

high
as
this
is
a
very

just

this
would
be
truly
delectable
as
a
lifelong
fan
of
the
chocolate
maltnot
the
shakethe
malt
i
must
say
i
really
dig
this
stuff
it
is
to
me
like
a
chocolate
maltedexcept
its
beer
wow
two
great
tastes
for
the
price
of
one
the
color
is
cool
too
so
brown
it
is
a
tad
short
of
black
lovely
aromas
of
chocolate
malt
and
some
coffee
extract
in
the
mouth
all
malted
milk
well
a
hint
of
roasted
mocha
too
if
you
love
a
good
malted
you
will
throughly
enjoy
this
stuff
perhaps
one
of
the
best
malteds
ive
hadalmost
as
good
as
moms
highly
drinkable
as
well
one
sip
begs
for
another
and
another
this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
that
dies
off
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
burned
malts
with
chocolate
and
coffee
as
the
other
major
aromas
the
flavor
is
mostly
a
strong
coffee
taste
with
a
little
chocolate
in
the
background
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
much
good
balance
of
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
malty
but
mostly
the
coffee
taste
hangs
around
this
is
a
pretty
good
sweet
stout
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
i
liked
coffee
a
friend
of
mine
raved
about
this
stuff
so
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
nearly
gagged
each
bottle
tasted
like
someone
had
poured
iodine
in
it
went
for
a
second
try
a
week
ago
180
degree
difference
on
my
0
to
100
scale
this
work
of
art
is
in
the
90s
and
i
only
have
about
5
rated
that
high
it
poured
dark
brown
with
a
one
inch
head
that
dissappeared
quickly
chocolately
aroma
wonderful
soft
mildly
sweet
chocolate
mocha
taste
which
faded
into
an
exquisite
roasted
malt
aftertaste
as
you
finish
the
bottle
a
nice
and
smooth
sweetness
lingers
in
your
mouth
there
will
always
be
at
least
one
bottle
of
this
in
my
house
nice
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
very
chocolate
smelling
almost
smells
like
chocolate
milk
at
first
at
first
the
beer
tastes
very
sweet
and
malty
then
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
kicks
in
to
balance
it
some
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
strong
in
my
opinion
but
its
not
horrible
i
can
only
assume
that
the
stuff
brewed
in
england
is
better
than
what
we
have
here
says
its
made
in
ohio
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
not
something
i
would
drink
often
but
definately
something
i
am
glad
i
tried
rather
thick
milky
thick
and
does
not
go
down
the
easiest
with
that
being
said
this
is
a
phenomonal
tasting
beer
tastes
like
a
chocolate
malt
shake
tons
of
chocolaty
goodness
in
it
slight
hops
are
put
into
the
background
to
control
the
sweetness
caramel
and
slight
strawberries
are
also
detected
finishes
with
a
chocolate
milk
sweetness
and
texture
i
wonder
how
this
compares
to
the
original
brewed
in
england
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
light
doesnt
even
penetrate
it
head
is
brown
and
foamy
and
lingers
long
dark
rings
form
around
the
glass
and
slowly
slide
down
aroma
is
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
is
big
and
rich
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
aftertaste
of
sweet
chocolate
with
hints
of
espresso
and
brown
sugar
surprisingly
drinkable
very
unique
for
a
beer
smooth
pour
with
a
dark
brown
head
unfortunately
the
foam
doesnt
last
very
long
tastes
like
a
stout
but
with
a
very
sweet
chocolate
tone
too
sweet
in
fact
and
thats
where
my
marks
drop
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
through
a
whole
pack
of
them
over
all
a
good
beer
but
i
need
a
little
bitterness
to
my
hops
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
a
good
stout
i
have
had
this
unique
twist
on
the
classic
stout
many
times
i
am
a
milk
drinker
and
a
stout
lover
so
i
didnt
hesitate
to
try
the
fabeled
milk
stout
pours
the
deepest
darkest
brown
youd
see
more
light
through
a
brick
wall
with
a
monstrous
mocha
head
that
cascades
for
minutes
making
for
a
circus
of
bubbles
in
my
glass
the
nose
is
exceedingly
sweetroasted
coffe
and
warm
milk
undertones
give
it
a
very
pleasant
smell
the
first
sip
was
uniquely
sweeter
than
most
stouts
and
pleasingly
creamy
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
with
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
warm
milk
all
balanced
perfectly
in
texture
but
is
definitely
a
sweet
stout
this
is
one
of
those
stouts
that
is
enjoyable
at
all
temperatures
but
i
recommend
trying
it
after
it
has
freed
itself
from
the
repressing
chains
of
refridgeration
as
it
has
and
will
build
more
character
one
final
note
this
beer
rates
high
in
an
unseen
category
and
that
is
value
at
78
per
six
pack
it
meets
the
final
requirement
for
a
session
stout
and
yes
in
my
oh
so
humble
opinion
it
is
far
superior
to
guiness
its
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
as
was
the
nicely
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
it
gives
some
of
the
wellknown
classic
dark
stout
characteristics
without
some
of
the
heavy
notes
a
perfect
dessertif
black
and
thick
with
a
tan
fluffy
head
aroma
is
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
great
flavor
almost
like
a
chocolate
dessert
a
slight
dryness
at
the
end
and
very
little
bitterness
one
of
my
favorite
sweet
stouts
this
has
become
my
absolute
favorite
drink
calling
this
beer
would
be
a
disservice
pours
out
as
deep
and
dark
as
molasses
with
a
moderate
head
smoky
chocolate
nose
with
a
hint
of
toffee
milky
opening
in
the
mouth
but
the
chocolate
hints
take
over
with
that
smoky
finish
big
and
beautiful
and
i
can
get
it
for
5
99
a
sixpack
this
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
firm
tan
head
the
aroma
was
the
weakest
part
of
the
beverage
the
maltiness
came
through
the
nose
but
was
muted
the
chocolate
jumped
out
on
the
tongue
and
overpowered
whatever
hops
there
was
the
beer
was
very
creamy
and
clung
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
great
stout
and
one
that
i
would
highly
recommend
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
thick
very
foamy
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
behind
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
a
rather
attractive
beer
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
that
of
burntroasted
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
tastes
very
sweet
and
chocolatey
feels
smooth
and
fairly
heavy
in
the
mouth
the
rather
heavy
feel
and
chocolatey
sweetness
too
sweet
for
my
liking
certainly
acted
to
limit
my
consumption
of
this
beeri
felt
as
though
i
had
eaten
too
much
dessert
in
finishing
my
glass
what
makes
this
so
drinkable
to
me
is
that
the
flavor
is
so
powerfully
deep
that
after
3
or
4
youre
gonna
still
be
able
to
enjoy
and
taste
it
quite
well
thats
only
an
opinion
i
should
test
that
hypothesis
to
be
sure
um
be
right
back
the
publican
claimed
that
this
is
one
of
her
favorites
and
i
can
certainly
understand
why
that
is
so
creamy
dark
and
delicious
this
is
and
beautiful
to
boot
the
lady
poured
this
in
a
lovely
inverted
cone
glass
to
show
off
the
aromas
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
as
well
the
smell
was
nice
if
a
bit
light
the
dark
brown
black
appearance
is
capped
by
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
does
some
lacing
though
not
much
this
one
is
about
creamy
rich
flavor
and
it
delivers
quite
well
all
the
aromas
are
also
in
the
taste
try
it
and
youll
like
it
like
i
said
im
going
to
have
to
try
mackeson
again
just
in
case
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
im
just
not
that
impressed
this
time
around
i
love
this
beer
its
been
one
of
my
favorites
ever
since
i
joined
the
dark
side
meaning
i
dont
drink
anymore
of
that
piss
colored
macro
stuff
it
pours
black
as
night
with
a
orangish
brown
head
that
changes
to
a
brownish
yellow
upon
settling
oh
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
yummy
i
mean
it
combines
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
those
lovely
chocolate
undertones
i
wish
they
had
this
scent
available
at
the
carwash
the
beer
drinks
smooth
with
a
coffee
chocolate
taste
the
roasted
malt
flavor
hangs
around
after
each
drink
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
dynamic
in
that
it
changes
from
the
beginning
of
the
sip
till
after
the
swallow
even
hints
of
some
bitterness
the
is
a
standard
in
my
favorites
wow
this
is
some
wicked
stuff
when
i
found
out
that
it
was
brewed
with
milk
just
blew
my
mind
i
am
a
big
milk
drinker
so
i
guess
thats
why
i
liked
it
the
head
was
a
nice
dark
red
color
and
lasted
a
little
while
the
smell
was
like
an
imperial
but
lighter
the
taste
was
a
dark
chocolate
mixed
with
the
smoothness
of
milk
when
i
say
smooth
i
mean
smoooth
it
coated
the
mouth
too
very
nice
i
will
definately
be
back
for
more
at
1
75
a
pop
the
flavor
is
very
chocolatey
just
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
imagine
there
is
a
great
arrangement
of
roasty
malts
that
leaves
you
with
an
espresso
flavoring
that
is
just
incredible
it
is
full
of
body
and
flavor
the
dry
aftertaste
brings
out
a
combination
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
that
is
truly
a
work
of
art
the
beer
is
not
very
complex
but
it
does
have
a
great
cast
of
characters
that
will
keep
you
interested
till
the
last
drop
an
excellent
stout
this
stout
is
hard
to
ignore
i
am
sure
there
are
better
but
this
one
really
snuck
up
on
me
it
offers
a
legit
stout
appearance
a
malty
aroma
and
a
fantastic
flavor
the
malt
flavor
seems
to
permiate
throughout
but
this
is
not
your
ordinary
stout
it
is
not
heavy
or
overly
rich
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
prost
this
milky
stout
poured
out
deep
black
with
a
thin
brown
lacey
layer
that
stays
like
that
till
the
end
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
you
could
get
some
sense
of
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
was
something
else
there
was
some
coffee
some
chocolate
sweetness
to
it
and
whole
milk
added
to
the
ending
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smoth
and
creamy
there
was
no
bitter
or
over
bearing
sweet
after
taste
it
was
crisp
and
clean
on
the
way
down
felt
like
i
was
drinking
some
chocolate
milk
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
smoothness
and
little
to
no
aftertaste
made
this
easily
drinkable
i
think
ill
have
another
dang
this
beer
is
dark
beautiful
thick
dark
brown
ultrafoamy
head
that
lasts
awhile
smells
wonderfully
of
chocolate
and
other
dark
malts
the
taste
is
absolutely
amazing
i
dont
have
an
expert
palate
but
i
can
clearly
discern
between
the
tangy
fruit
at
start
the
big
chocolate
cream
in
the
middle
and
bitter
coffee
smoke
in
the
finish
it
smooth
and
very
drinkable
probably
no
more
than
one
to
two
a
session
though
because
its
pretty
complex
a
beer
experience
like
this
is
rare
a
total
treat
whoa
nelly
do
i
love
this
stuff
one
hell
of
a
well
crafted
stout
this
was
my
turn
around
beer
for
years
i
drank
lagers
pilsners
and
pales
but
when
i
tried
this
stuff
i
new
i
was
missing
out
on
a
ton
it
also
happened
to
be
the
first
brew
i
ever
tried
from
england
as
well
that
was
about
13
years
ago
it
still
is
one
my
all
time
favorites
just
happened
to
have
some
left
over
from
a
xmas
party
so
i
recently
drank
away
for
me
its
the
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
that
put
this
so
high
on
my
scale
of
yummyness
great
roasty
smokey
feel
and
taste
the
whole
way
through
super
smooth
and
very
appetizing
nice
creamy
smoked
cocoa
flavors
with
a
great
balance
of
roasted
barley
and
hops
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
biting
to
much
or
going
to
sour
deep
deep
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
fades
equally
across
the
top
pretty
quickly
which
opens
nicely
into
the
aromas
of
the
smokey
chocolate
coffee
smell
this
triple
stout
rocks
mackeson
xxx
will
always
be
what
i
hold
my
expectations
of
other
stouts
to
certainly
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
there
jet
black
in
appearance
it
pours
very
nicely
and
develops
a
rich
thick
head
that
stands
the
test
of
time
tasty
chocolatey
and
bold
but
not
overbearing
the
taste
pleases
the
palate
immensely
a
good
session
beer
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
beer
hits
the
mark
from
the
bottle
just
a
shade
less
so
but
still
a
great
choice
when
thinking
stout
this
one
of
my
first
attempts
at
reviewing
a
stout
is
a
beer
i
shall
revisit
i
had
read
a
good
deal
about
this
brew
in
various
publications
and
was
interested
to
see
whether
the
lore
lived
up
to
its
promise
it
certainly
did
triple
x
poured
deep
and
thick
like
whole
milk
it
was
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dissappeared
very
quickly
it
reminded
me
very
much
of
some
imperial
stouts
i
have
had
it
smelled
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
split
between
a
bailys
irish
cream
and
the
bottem
of
a
grille
it
had
a
very
interesting
burnt
charcol
notes
with
very
rich
deep
roasted
flavors
witha
just
a
little
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
i
could
imagine
this
being
what
the
bottom
of
a
coffee
pot
tastes
like
this
is
a
beer
i
recomend
not
only
for
the
novelty
but
for
the
fine
craft
used
to
brew
it
poured
pitch
black
with
nice
caramel
colored
headvery
sweet
bitter
chocolate
smell
very
sweet
earthy
chocolaty
tastemaybe
a
bit
to
sweet
but
is
very
good
low
in
strength
wich
makes
it
very
drinkabledrinking
one
as
i
write
this
sweetest
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
know
what
made
me
try
this
but
im
glad
i
did
this
is
up
there
with
the
those
ive
tried
so
far
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
one
i
was
poured
a
5oz
of
this
by
the
barkeep
but
he
wouldnt
tell
me
what
it
was
until
after
i
finished
it
not
what
i
was
expecting
pours
out
nice
and
dark
with
a
good
head
tastes
like
a
good
stout
but
there
is
a
twist
its
sweet
a
fruity
goodness
with
just
enough
dry
to
keep
it
in
check
this
is
a
solid
stout
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
disappointed
when
i
read
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
cincinnati
and
not
london
tricky
little
bastards
pours
thick
and
black
with
only
a
thin
head
at
first
that
is
quite
deceptive
i
thought
that
i
was
pouring
too
gently
due
to
the
thin
head
and
poured
the
last
third
of
the
beer
more
aggressively
to
develop
a
good
head
however
the
head
continued
to
slowly
grow
and
grow
into
a
tremendous
creamy
and
rocky
brown
head
well
after
i
had
finished
pouring
and
damn
near
overflowed
my
glass
retention
is
great
and
the
head
coats
the
glass
as
you
drink
nose
is
sweet
milk
chocolate
with
notes
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
and
caramel
the
aroma
definitely
lets
you
know
that
youre
in
for
a
real
treat
smooth
and
oh
so
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
full
body
taste
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
aroma
leads
you
to
believe
with
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
coffee
icecream
roasted
malts
and
chewy
toffee
some
fruity
notes
are
also
present
as
well
as
a
trace
of
hop
bitterness
one
of
the
finest
stouts
i
have
ever
sampled
this
was
brewed
in
cincinatti
see
notes
on
whitbread
brewed
there
pretty
good
stuff
poured
a
motoroil
like
texture
that
gulped
and
produced
a
tall
head
that
eventually
reduced
to
nothing
aromas
of
coffeechocolatecaramelprunesand
raisins
were
hinted
at
a
full
body
pouring
at
solid
blackthick
and
creamy
no
signs
of
lacing
slight
crisp
mouthfeel
very
bitter
sweet
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
most
of
the
tastes
touched
on
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
very
good
stoutbut
drinkability
would
cure
me
of
it
too
sweet
and
rich
to
be
drinking
all
night
pours
out
as
black
as
the
devils
soul
the
head
is
a
dark
brown
also
and
settles
out
pretty
quick
this
is
where
looks
can
be
deceiving
the
taste
is
awesome
i
now
have
a
new
favorite
stout
definite
notes
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
smooth
and
very
clean
on
the
palate
this
should
be
a
mandatory
try
for
any
serious
ba
an
above
average
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
compared
to
other
stouts
in
my
book
the
brew
is
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
thick
rocky
head
that
dies
quickly
the
aroma
is
overly
sweet
for
a
stout
at
first
it
smells
nice
like
a
box
of
chocolates
but
gets
a
little
too
sweet
as
you
drink
flavor
continues
to
border
on
the
too
sweet
but
is
tolerable
with
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
caramel
needs
more
hops
a
drinkable
stout
but
i
was
a
bit
let
down
much
better
stouts
to
be
had
out
there
the
archetypal
black
stout
color
the
head
full
and
frothy
in
its
texture
the
lace
a
latticework
of
fine
bubbles
to
coat
the
glass
roasted
grains
sweet
milk
chocolate
light
coffee
tones
and
quite
pleasing
to
the
nose
ambrosial
start
the
top
rich
and
thick
finish
sprightly
acidic
hops
mellow
and
perfect
for
this
style
quite
good
stout
in
its
own
right
and
one
i
sample
often
jason
notes
that
the
uk
version
of
this
beer
is
even
better
while
i
do
not
doubt
that
its
hard
to
imagine
that
this
could
be
much
improved
upon
if
you
dont
expect
a
robust
stout
its
a
milk
stout
people
you
will
love
this
offering
initially
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
im
used
to
a
higher
alcohol
from
a
stout
and
thicker
body
im
very
sensitive
to
overly
sweet
food
or
drinks
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
actually
made
my
teeth
hurt
very
good
beer
nonetheless
but
i
did
not
find
this
one
to
be
overly
sweet
at
first
did
seem
sweeter
after
a
couple
and
more
carbonated
almost
sodalike
good
taste
and
goes
down
easily
does
not
provide
the
overall
warming
quality
of
a
stronger
stout
but
really
nice
to
drink
i
would
not
choose
this
over
shakespeare
or
samuel
smith
but
certainly
worth
trying
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
one
of
the
best
5
beers
of
the
50
i
tried
that
evening
pours
an
oily
black
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
complex
flavor
and
a
light
alcohol
finish
that
made
it
a
rather
cozy
beer
awesome
jet
black
color
small
creamy
tan
head
this
stuff
looks
great
sweet
chocolate
milk
aroma
very
sweet
with
some
burnt
malt
bitterness
milky
mouthfeel
lactose
added
i
dont
like
this
stout
too
much
sweetness
and
milky
feel
this
beer
asserts
itself
immediately
with
an
aroma
which
is
attentiongrabbing
no
matter
how
cold
the
beer
chocolately
with
big
whiffs
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
cherries
very
liquerlike
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
which
dissipates
almost
immediately
leaving
just
thin
wisps
on
the
surface
and
a
lace
on
the
glass
the
flavor
is
rich
and
starts
off
wonderfully
grainy
rather
like
a
schwarz
beer
as
youd
expect
from
an
ale
though
this
beer
develops
a
much
more
robust
presence
in
the
mouth
very
full
bodied
with
a
milky
sweet
mainpalate
followed
by
an
everso
slight
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
is
roasty
mellow
and
pleasant
very
wellbalanced
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
is
inky
black
with
a
nice
brown
head
it
recedes
to
a
thin
film
withnin
30
seconds
provides
adequate
lacing
however
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
tones
on
the
nose
boy
you
can
sure
taste
the
milk
sugar
in
this
one
definitely
a
sweet
character
in
this
one
there
are
some
subtle
bittersweet
chocolate
tones
also
roasted
nut
also
comes
to
mind
body
is
too
thin
for
a
stout
about
medium
overall
this
is
a
nice
tasting
enjoyable
stout
even
if
it
is
brewed
in
ohio
mackeson
triple
xxx
stout
has
a
deep
brown
in
a
sense
almost
black
color
it
has
a
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
its
nose
is
one
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
it
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
with
notes
of
licorice
chocolate
and
coffee
this
milk
stout
is
sweet
malty
and
fullbodied
with
low
carbonation
that
still
leaves
a
nice
lacework
on
the
glass
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
complex
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
the
aroma
is
excellent
with
the
smell
of
chocolate
coming
from
the
glass
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overpowering
a
good
afterdinner
stout
nice
roasted
malt
taste
with
some
lingering
sweetness
on
the
finish
delishious
stuff
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
head
and
a
good
collar
which
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
richly
caramel
and
lightly
cocoaish
with
no
roastiness
or
hops
the
body
is
thinmedium
much
lighter
than
i
remember
with
a
limited
carbonation
level
and
a
silky
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
more
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
than
chocolate
or
roasted
malts
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
with
a
lightly
sweet
lingering
caramel
malt
very
onesided
and
much
thinner
than
i
remember
still
very
rich
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
pours
practically
black
as
night
with
a
coffee
colored
head
and
generous
lace
espresso
aroma
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
and
taste
chocolate
and
espresso
flavors
with
a
sweet
slightly
burnt
taste
would
be
excellent
as
a
dessert
but
works
anytime
i
got
to
go
get
more
a
top
on
my
list
pours
black
but
not
as
opaque
or
as
dark
as
some
surprisingly
dark
tan
head
smell
is
chocolate
milk
and
burnt
toast
flavor
is
more
chocolate
apple
peel
with
a
burnt
bitter
finish
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
reminds
me
of
a
weak
imperial
stout
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
grainy
pours
almost
black
color
with
a
ruby
tint
the
head
is
a
deep
brownish
tan
color
on
the
nose
there
are
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
on
the
palate
all
the
flavors
are
sweet
chocolate
caramel
roasted
coffee
light
hop
bitterness
but
the
sweet
malts
dominate
this
brewemmm
this
stuff
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
extra
smooth
the
stuff
is
deliciousgreat
stout
black
body
and
thick
fuzzy
tan
head
settled
quickly
but
still
fell
down
the
glass
nicely
heavy
roasted
malt
carmel
chocolate
smells
tasted
just
fine
to
me
lots
of
sweetness
creamy
and
smooth
noticable
chocolate
flavor
on
both
the
sweet
and
bitter
side
not
as
silky
smooth
as
say
a
guinness
but
very
drinkable
more
bubbly
and
carbonated
than
i
expected
not
as
robust
and
balanced
flavor
wise
as
other
stouts
but
as
a
sweet
stout
i
thought
it
was
really
good
the
fact
that
this
is
contract
brewed
in
the
u
s
doesnt
matter
to
me
its
made
in
my
hometown
which
is
cool
with
me
very
dark
color
and
dark
brown
head
as
well
head
of
12
inch
but
decreases
pretty
quickly
low
carbonation
smell
has
a
touch
of
blueberry
to
it
starts
flavorful
light
bodied
and
fruity
sweet
finishes
thicker
with
a
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
combination
one
of
the
better
finishes
in
beerdom
tasty
gets
a
high
mark
for
swapping
two
good
flavor
profiles
in
the
sip
okay
this
beer
poured
out
a
lovely
dark
color
a
very
dark
beer
it
formed
a
nice
dark
head
the
aroma
was
hard
to
pick
up
maybe
malt
the
body
seamed
a
little
lighter
than
other
stouts
i
have
had
but
it
still
seamed
creamy
the
flavor
of
it
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
like
i
found
the
youngs
to
be
i
am
horribly
dissapointed
and
i
hope
ive
just
had
bad
luck
thrice
heard
terrific
things
about
this
beer
and
am
disappointed
perhaps
inevitably
perhaps
this
sample
is
old
anyway
certainly
a
serviceable
stout
with
molasses
not
chocolate
and
a
burnt
smoky
undercurrent
plus
what
seems
like
a
bunch
of
sugar
dumped
in
and
stirred
around
is
that
the
result
of
the
lactose
mouthfeel
thinnish
and
sugary
as
if
the
corners
of
sugar
crystals
are
slicing
your
tongue
i
do
like
many
things
about
this
stout
including
the
strong
for
the
style
hop
presence
and
lingering
finish
super
as
a
digestif
but
for
casual
drinking
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
surprising
considering
how
much
i
like
sweet
stouts
taste
is
above
all
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
incredibly
velvety
mouthfeel
silky
almost
very
good
but
almost
too
sweet
for
me
i
can
see
how
this
was
once
called
milk
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
something
akin
to
milk
being
a
stoutman
one
word
tastee
sweet
as
one
would
expect
of
a
milk
stout
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
silky
as
any
beer
ive
had
almost
as
good
as
sex
this
is
an
excellent
stout
and
seems
to
taste
the
same
as
the
original
brewed
in
london
thick
creamy
head
almost
black
smooth
sweetroasted
flavor
good
mix
of
hops
oh
man
its
like
a
milk
dud
and
a
milky
way
in
beer
form
chocolate
kaleidescope
of
aromas
and
flavors
even
a
bit
of
that
awesome
fruitcake
essence
nice
malty
body
ultra
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
perfect
hop
bite
in
the
end
to
cut
off
the
sweetness

chocolate
lovers
delight
cheers
to
frank4sail
for
the
sample
12
oz
bottle
hints
of
hersheys
bitter
sweet
chocolate
bar
great
beer
for
the
winter
months
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
an
above
average
stout
a
great
change
of
pace
in
the
stout
world
and
constantly
enjoyable
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
on
a
daily
basis
but
a
treat
when
i
am
looking
for
something
of
the
sort
dark
as
night
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
the
aroma
was
fairly
reserved
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweetish
as
one
would
expect
of
a
milk
stout
but
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
was
about
as
soft
and
silky
as
any
beer
ive
had
no
coffee
notes
but
a
chocolate
essence
under
the
malt
my
only
ding
against
this
beer
was
that
the
smoky
notes
seemed
to
be
a
little
musty
this
is
my
dream
stout
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
stout
dark
with
a
beutifull
copperblack
blend
head
nice
sweetish
smell
and
the
taste
is
pure
heaven
ive
been
a
cult
follower
of
watneys
cream
stout
for
several
years
and
havent
been
able
to
find
it
for
about
5
years
now
this
may
top
it
perfect
sweet
stout
not
overly
sweet
or
strong
just
an
easy
drinking
extremley
tasty
high
quality
stout
i
could
go
on
and
on
one
of
my
top
10
beers
of
all
time
and
possibly
my
favorite
very
dark
black
color
low
carbonation
initial
pour
the
head
is
thick
and
tan
which
does
not
last
long
the
aroma
is
sweet
hoppy
slightly
burnt
and
mossy
delicious
sweet
malty
coffee
and
bittterchocolate
flavor
chewy
smooth
thick
and
creamy
an
excellent
stout
my
first
choice
as
my
breakfast
stout
because
of
the
taste
and
the
low
alcohol
content
i
read
that
its
only
3
75
always
stocked
in
my
frig
enjoy
cheers
dark
as
dark
can
be
very
sweet
with
just
a
tad
of
coffeelike
bitterness
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
my
sample
was
brewed
by
contract
in
the
us
for
whitbread
an
amazing
stout
it
is
quite
good
but
what
is
this
crap
i
hear
about
it
being
better
than
guinness
mackeson
is
quite
good
but
it
cant
touch
the
good
stuff
from
st
james
gate
one
hell
of
a
stout
the
sweetness
and
slight
smokiness
makes
this
distinct
beer
one
to
remember
a
gift
from
the
beer
gods
though
i
am
giving
it
a
lower
score
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
brewed
in
the
us
and
it
is
not
half
as
good
as
the
real
stuff
ugh
i
know
this
is
par
for
the
style
but
i
just
cant
stand
that
sweetness
it
looks
good
it
smells
good
but
get
rid
of
the
milk
sugar
primo
im
glad
theyre
making
this
in
the
u
s
now
as
good
as
any
ive
tried
this
and
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
are
my
2
alltime
favorites
beer
doesnt
get
any
better
great
as
aperitif
or
paired
with
a
dessert
a
magnificent
and
prime
example
of
a
sweet
stout
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
no
head
at
all
some
very
minor
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
sweetness
for
the
most
part
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
some
chocolate
with
some
very
light
spice
goes
down
very
smooth
and
not
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
but
finished
slightly
dry
mediumbodied
with
almost
no
carbonation
which
is
actually
typical
for
most
milk
stouts
overall
a
tasty
brew
great
beer
smooth
lots
of
flavor
loved
it
possibly
defective
way
too
much
carbonation
a
lackluster
milk
stout
with
little
visual
appeal
other
than
the
body
color
and
a
somewhat
strange
almost
lightweight
stout
flavor
drinkable
and
somewhat
interesting
but
hardly
a
musthave
beer
cheers
bottom
line
a
solid
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
would
buy
this
again
and
recommend
to
those
who
enjoy
stouts
and
other
malt
forward
beers
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
opaque
black
with
quickly
dissapating
tan
head
aroma
is
smokey
dark
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
coffee
chocolate
with
distant
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
with
wet
finish
overall
a
competent
milk
stout
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
decent
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
very
drinkable
tasty
and
id
totally
have
this
one
again
o
very
nice
beer
very
smooth
and
tasty
perhaps
slightly
too
sweet
tasty
a
decent
milk
stout
that
goes
down
a
treat
looks
the
part
with
a
superb
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
a
good
flavour
that
possesses
a
delicate
sweetness
the
body
could
use
improvement
thicker
and
more
velvety
is
the
way
to
go
overall
though
a
nice
brew
that
hits
the
spot
id
have
one
again
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
really
nice
sweet
stout
usually
a
style
i
stay
away
from
but
this
one
was
big
on
flavor
and
kept
the
sweetness
modest
very
drinkable
and
not
too
much
body
carbonation
was
spot
on
great
example
of
the
style
overall
there
isnt
that
much
to
it
like
drinking
a
beer
flavored
soda
overall
steel
toe
stout
is
pretty
solid
while
i
doubt
id
actively
seek
it
out
again
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
it
another
shake
o
overall
its
a
nice
milk
stout
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for

that
quickly
recedes
a
rich

with
some

and
roast
tastes
like
roasted
chocolate

with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
wonderfully
creamy

a
great

the

of

this
is
a

i
would
have
considered
it

light
i
prefer
my
stouts
creamy
at
least
which
this
had
barely
any
of
like
i
said
it
somehow
worked
with
the
mellowness
of
the

it
could
use
a

enjoyed

good

i
would

it

for

although
i
dont

i
will
buy
it
again
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
though

there
are

who

love

the

a

notes
besides
roast

the
steel

goes
down
easily
with
a
big
flavor
of
rock

and
a
smoky
aftertaste
this
beer
is
sweeter
and
smoother
than
other
stouts
i
have
tried
which
is
what
i
gather
one
should
expect
from

a

though
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
nice
balance
overall
though
poured
into
a
standard

the
beer
is
a
dark

color
the

starts
out
dark

and
rather
small
then
dissipates
to
virtually
nothing
minimal

there
is
an
aroma
of

and
roasted

they
dont
mislabel
this
beer
its
definitely
a
sweet
stout
the
sweetness
comes
through
at
the
beginning
with
the
burnt
malt
and
dry
bitter
chocolate
taste
it
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
gets
knocked
because
this
beer
is
watery
and
feels
like
a
cola
to
me
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
add
up
to
much
with
a

expect

a

this

the
label
says
a

milk
stout
great
for
the
end
of
a
hard
day
overall
on
a
positive
note
the
flavors
and
body
of
this
beer
are
great
on
the
flip
side
however
the
serious
lack
of
carbonation
not
to
mention
any
foam
is
a
big
problem
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
good
homebrew
that
ive
tasted
prior
to
racking
to
the
bottling
bucket
its
just
not
a
finished
product
if
you
can
find
it

try
it
otherwise

recommend
avoiding

the

a

the

though
the

muted
a
bit
and
the

has
dropped

still
this

tastes
pretty

the

is
a
straight

with
a
lovely

and
a
subsequently
really
smooth

a

this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
into
a
beer
without
too
much
alcohol
in
it
it
is
very
drinkable
as
well
i
will
be
reaching
for
this

the

black

hints
at
the
deep
enveloping
chocolate
flavors
insude
in
the
nose
i
find
scents
of
freshly
unwrapped
premium
chocolate
the
kind
you
cringe
when
buying
even
if
its
for
a
special
occasion
with
chocolate
malt
and
a
nice
rich
dairy
freshness
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
oozing
with
even
more
chocolate
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
recalls
slices
of
decadent
chocolate
cake
had
at
fancy
dinners
in
the
past
the
boisterous
carbonation
washes
away
the
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
leaving
behind
a
short
but
very
intense
burst
of
chocolate
astringency
milk
stouts
are
engineered
with
lactose
sugar
in
mind
but
the
steel
toe
is
a
special
example
of
just
how
sweet
a
deep
dark
beer
can
get
with
a
heady
dose
of
lactose
i
never
find
it
cloying
but
i
also
know
that
a
drink
that
sweet
doesnt
seem
like
a
beer
sometimes
all
the
same
darn
good
drinking
and
practically
begging
to
be
paired
with
a
nice
vanilla
ice
cream
o
a
fine
milk
stout
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
o
ive
had
better
milk
stouts
but
also
worse
this
one
just
didnt
have
a
lot
behind
it
to
really
make
me
think
highly
of
it
it
was
decent
and
drinkable
but
could
have
been
better
especially
if
the
tartness
wouldnt
have
been
so
prominent
for
first
half
of
the
glass
o
this
brew
is
awesome
definitely
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
super
solid
creamy
and
rich
just
like
the
nose
represents
this
is
an
awesome
wellrounded
brew
a
must
try
if
youre
able
top
of
its
class
worth
trying
this
at
a
good
price
point
should
have
got
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
quality
of
a
milk
stout
and
this
is
no
exception
the
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
very
chewy
texture
though
goes
down
lighter
than
expected
enjoy
o
all

drink
d
easy
drinking
milk
stout
for
the
working
man
you
could
easily
knock
these
back
but
i
tend
to
stop
at
one
or
two
in
a
session
d
pretty
solid
stout
here
nothing
flashy
fits
the
style
and
has
decent
drinkability
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
and
wasnt
too
upset
about
not
having
another
on
reserve
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
though
d
a
decent

id
drink
another
quite

d
definitely

almost
to
the
point
of
being
a
sessionable

not

sweet

at

there
are

overall
the

present
in
aroma
and
the
initial
taste
that
quickly
abates
and
what
is
left
is
reminiscent
of
a
baltic
porter
drinkability
overall
i
give
this
one
credit
where
its
due
and
believe
that
its
definitely
better
than
most
other
milk
stouts
that
ive
had
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
with
that
creamy
and
sweet
flavor
set
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
drinkable
there
is
no
problem
finishing
the
glass
however
it
is
a
bit
too
forward
with
the
lactose
sweetness
more
of
the
roasted
grains
would
have
been
much
more
enjoyable
with
the
lactose
being
a
bit
more
faint
instead
of
being
so
forward
in
the
taste
taste
enjoyable
hits
the
smoothness
of
style
while
not
compromising
any
of
the
chewiness
and
dark
roast
resulting
in
a
solid
yet
smooth
stout
chocolate
stands
tall
as
well
never
massive
a
great
sessionesque
stout
for
the
weekdays
drank
these
while
skiing
mostly
d
not
a
trainwreck
of
a
beer
but
comparing
this
to
the
wonderful
left

milk

its
playing
in
the
minors
d
very
quaffable
and
pleasantly
smooth
a
workingmans
beer
for
sure
i
dont
know
what
took
me
so
long
to
finally
drink
this
beer
im
definitely
glad
i
did
and
it
looks
like
ill
have
to
find
more
soon
d
this
is
a
fine
milk
stout
good
flavor
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
i
liked
this
stout
lots
of
nice
roast
and
coffee
a
nice
surprise
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
fantastic
id
drink
more
than
one
d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
nothing
super
special
but
good
overall
drinkability
high
i
poured
this
beer
then
i
got
a
phone
call
took
it
outside
and
in
10
min
i
looked
down
and
it
was
gone
enjoyed
it
to
the
last
drop
d
exceptional
to
say
the
least
when
im
not
experimenting
with
specialty
porters
and
stouts
this
will
be
my
go
to
every
day
beer
d
very
flavorful
and
balanced
wonderful
mouthfeel
d
pretty
decent
stout
although
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
expected
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
this
one
was
a
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
head
decent
retention
but
good
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
the
flavors
were
chocolate
malt
and
something
creamy
or
milky
definitely
a
milk
stout
with
the
sweetness
good
but
limited
in
depth
decent
body
could
be
richer
and
heavier
moderate
carbonation
could
be
smoother
too
d
though
i
have
had
this
in
the
past
and
liked
it
maybe
this
wasnt
such
a
good
batch
im
just
unsure
and
will
have
to
try
another
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
per
sitting
although
i
prefer
heavier
stouts
the
body
is
not
good
really
for

stout
i
want
more
of

this
is

finish
no
off

like
most
of
the
other
breweries
products
didnt
have
it
fresh
and
was
slightly
oxidized
but
still
enjoyable
wasnt
a
big
fan
compared
to
others
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
this
is
an
excellent
milk
stout
that
is
really
the
benchmark
that
all
other
milk
stouts
should
be
judged
i
love
milk
stouts
ever
since
i
gave
them
a
try
for
curiosities
sake
it
was
at
first
the
brewer
who
drew
me
to
the
beer
wittgensteins
infamous
duckrabbit
nonetheless
the
flavour
struck
me
as
rather
soothing
for
a
beer
it
is
dark
and
a
tadbit
heavy
though
not
too
much
velvety
smooth
stout
with
cheerwine
tobacco
coco
puff
flavors
very
nice
good
regional
beer
not
the
best
but
a
good
way
to
introduce
yourself
to
the
style
overall
this
is
a
really
good
milk
stout
i
really
like
the
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
vanilla
and
malt
that
this
beer
imparts
really
good
overall
pretty
good
milk
stout
its
a
bit
different
from

stouts
ive
had
before
definitely
worth
a
try
pruod
to
have
this
as
a
regional
beer
full
flavorgreat
on
the
palate
overall
not
a
bad
introduction
to
the
style
though
i
think
i
prefer
other
stout
varieties
coffee
ris
etc
its
not
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
well
done
and
very
tasty
pours
from
the
growler
with
an
extremely
dark
brown
tarlike
color
verging
on
pitch
black
the
spongy
mocha
head
falls
quickly
leaving
a
resilient
thin
layer
on
the
surface
and
an
appetizing
collar
around
the
glass
pronounced
cocoa
powder
smell
with
nondescript
fruity
esters
faint
sour
breads
and
mild
smoke
in
the
nose
now
the
first
sip
surprisingly
sweet
milk
sugars
in
the
front
and
an
equally
surprising
tart
sour
cream
taste
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
ashy
with
lingering
burnt
malts
the
lactose
imparts
a
distinctive
table
sugar
sweetness
and
near
spoiled
sour
milk
tang
any
semblance
of
cocoa
is
quickly
overshadowed
by
this
competing
dynamic
the
abv
is
modest
but
i
detect
a
small
amount
of
fusel
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
with
snappy
crisp
carbonation
perhaps
too
spritzy
for
the
style
i
seem
to
recall
this
having
a
much
creamier
texture
and
milder
carbonation
when
i
had
it
from
a
bottle
my
companions
arrived
at
the
same
independent
conclusion
the
last
time
i
had
this
late
2013
i
couldnt
wait
to
grab
another
one
this
time
not
so
much
its
possible
that
my
palate
has
evolved
but
im
fairly
certain
this
has
much
more
to
do
with
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
ideal
selection
for
lovers
of
sweet
beer
i
can
see
where
the
surprising
tartness
could
throw
some
people
for
a
loop
but
without
it
this
would
quickly
become
too
sugary
ill
stick
with
westbrook
or
left
hand
but
wouldnt
pass
this
up
if
offered
i
just
hope
its
offered
in
a
bottle
instead
of
a
growler
from
my
tasting
notes
2009
the
best
sweet
stout
or
milk
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
the
impressive
thing
to
me
about
this
was
the
slight
sourness
to
the
flavor
like
near
spoiling
milk
real
genuine
milkiness
from
a
beer
this
is
a
real
work
of
art
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
also
prefect
the
craving
to
drink
another
and
another
just
doesnt
quit
cant
really
taste
the
lactose
but
it
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
feel
and
a
great
finish
good
wish
i
had
tested
before
tasting
a
better
stout
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
out
there
great
overall
great
sweet
dark
flavor
right
up
my
alley
great
brew
manages
to
be
extremely
flavorful
and
slightly
earthy
yet
sublimely
drinkable
pours
near
black
with
some
redclear
highlights
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
wellcarbed
but
its
all
made
up
for
in
the
taste
with
the
lactose
and
and
the
smooth
dark
malt
flavors
this
is
about
the
only
stout
that
i
can
literally
pound
a
whole
bottle
in
one
slow
motion
and
be
happy
not
because
i
can
but
because
its
just
freakin
tasty
and
drinkably

i
got
some
belgian

like
flavor
which
seemed
odd
to
me
because
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
didnt
get
this
flavor
it
tastes
great
and
has
a
slick
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
drinkability
is
high
because
its
not
too
sweet
and
has
a
relatively
low

this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
and
im
a
little
ashamed
i
havent
drank
more
of
it
since
its
so
readily
available
in
nc
overall
as
far
as
milk
stouts
go
this
one
cant
touch
my
favorites
this
is
my
perfect
stout
easy
drinking
black
smooth
coffee
stout
poured
as
a
dark
brown
with
an
almost
caramel
head
very
nice
coffee
aroma
with
a
hint
of
cream
has
a
upfront
coffee
taste
with
a
nice
creamy
almost
chocolate
after
taste
it
is
heavy
on
the
mouth
almost
milky
not
too
much
on
the
hoppy
side
seems
to
be
a
great
milk
stout
be
one
of
my
go
tos
for
a
milk
stout
what
i
got
to
drink
was
enjoyable
too
bad
every
attempt
at
pouring
it
resulted
in
an
eruption
of
froth
almost
entirely
head
blasting
out
of
the
bottle
like
a
beer
geyser
will
need
to
try
again
wonderful
excellent
dark
color
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
flavor
o
this
one
has
a
nice
mix
of
roasty
malt
and
sweet
sugarylactose
flavor
that
seems
to
compliment
each
other
nicely
highly
drinkable
4
o
this
time
i
will
stick
to
my
guns
and
pass
on
the
duck
rabbit
there
are
so
many
other
choices
that
offer
the
same
taste
profile
but
with
more
of
a
creamy
lower
carbonated
beer
aka
left
handed
nitro
lancaster
milk
stout
terrapin
moohoo
to
name
a
few
overall
i
have
tried
this
and
left
hand
in
the
type
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
look
for
it
ask
for
it
and
demand
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
duck
rabbit
can
do
some
great
things
their
milk
stout
falls
into
that
category
its
creamy
and
rich
with
bold
flavors
but
remains
extremely
drinkable
the
balance
is
there
this
needs
to
be
purchased
by
the
case
o
hugely
disappointed
will
not
buy
again
overall
drinkability
full
flavored
interesting
and
good
with
desert
chocolate
peanut
butter
banana
bread
i
suspect
it
would
be
a
very
good
base
for
ice
cream
floats
and
probably
would
go
well
with
a
burger
also
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
per
evening
though
but
i
think
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
i
see
it
other
than
a
weak
aroma
a
good
beer
o
if
the
carbonation
were
toned
down
a
bit
this
would
be
a
very
enjoyable
and
above
average
beer
with
the
distracting
prickliness
it
is
just
okay
poured
a
nearly
black
with
a
shortlived
light
tan
head
no
lacing
is
left
the
aroma
is
mild
but
does
have
nice
deep
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
little
earthiness
the
taste
is
just
straightforward
deep
roasted
malt
with
just
a
little
sweetness
from
the
lactose
it
has
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
and
a
silky
feel
and
finish
its
another
very
good
dark
beer
from
this
brewery
good
chocolate
and
roast
presence
but
the
acrid
character
spoils
the
flavor
a
bit
not
as
luxurious
mouthfeel
as
some
oa
well
done
milk
stout
never
too
sweet
without
proper
accompanying
bitterness
better
balance
of
flavors
than
many
within
this
style
onever
had
a
milk
stout
before
did
expect
more
creaminess
and
sweetness
but
got
neither
still
a
very
good
beer
with
exceptional
flavor
pours

slight

slight

hint

and
a

overall
good
aroma
feel
and
appearance
but
the
body
was
only
average
total
3050
overall
a
solid
beer
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
that
being
said
it
is
lacking
in
some
areas
the
first
being
the
appearance
i
love
a
nice
head
on
my
stouts
and
this
beer
just
seems
to
not
retain
a
proper
head
well
at
all
i
think
this
affects
my
ability
to
properly
judge
the
smell
but
what
i
can
smell
is
a
bit
of
toffee
or
caramel
the
taste
is
surprisingly
crisp
for
a
milk
stout
but
i
don
t
mind
that
a
great
aftertaste
in
my
opinion
too
some
surprising
biter
notes
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
this
combines
with
the
crisp
initial
taste
to
give
this
milk
stout
a
very
clean
and
enjoyable
character
will
have
it
again
deep
brown
hue
and
is
only
letting
a
bit
of
light
through
when
held
up
to
light
a
quarter
inch
of
tightly
woven
khaki
colored
head
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
cocoa
powder
and
lactose
greets
my
nose
the
body
is
silky
smooth
and
creamy
i
get
cocoa
and
lactose
quickly
fading
away
when
i
take
a
taste
very
carbonated
poured
with
a
very
tall
tan
head
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
you
can
tell
based
on
the
pop
of
the
bottle
cap
the
beer
itself
is
dark
brown
smells
of
roasted
malts
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
nutty
and
bready
too
the
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
as
well
as
chocolate
and
espresso
its
a
medium
bodied
brew
thats
smooth
and
sticky
very
solid
beer
here
i
just
open
a
bottle
of
this
stout
and
up
my
rating
rjt
o
somewhat
similar
to
their
porter
just
a
few
notches
sweeter
and
less
citrusbitter
than
it
reminds
me
mostly
of
moderatelysweetened
malty
darkroast
coffee
or
alcoholic
malta
pretty
dang
good
though
im
not
sure
id
drink
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
overall
a
good
solid
milk
stout
from
the
philosopher
a
bit
too
much
char
up
front
and
a
bit
sticky
of
a
mouthfeel
at
the
end
but
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
beer
it
pours
into
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
substantial
head
and
a
foamy
white
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
the
typical
stout
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
with
a
bit
of
coffee
as
well
the
taste
is
the
same
mix
but
is
actually
alot
more
drinkable
and
sweet
than
most
brews
of
this
style
it
feels
slightly
syrupy
but
with
noticeable
carbonation
and
a
smoothness
that
i
didnt
really
expect
overall
im
not
a
massive
stout
fan
or
anything
but
this
seems
like
a
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
variation
overall
super
yummy
sweet
full
flavor
bold
coffee
scents
and
flavors
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
tasty
and
good
example
of
the
style
makes
the
brewery
worth
another
try
but
doesnt
blow
anything
away
this
is
a
horribly
strong
beer
with
no
redeeming
features
including
the
weak
alcohol
content
this
is
a
horribly
dull
beer
with
no
redeeming
features
including
the
weak
alcohol
content
this
is
a
horribly
dark
beer
with
no
redeeming
features
including
the

content
o
a
very
tasty
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
was
pleased
with
this
one
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
overall

fortunate

a
bit
thin
but
not
watery
by
any

solid
for
the

more

towards
the
end
of
the

thin
dry
body
leading
to
a
bitter
and
roasted
aftertaste
with
a
bittersweet

backbone
the
finish
is
slick
and
smooth
with
a
bitter
and
roasted
linger
remaining
very
drinkable
with
the
lower
abv
and
thin
body
and
the
flavors
come
across
robust
almost
to
the
point
of
huge
i
really
like
this
beer
to
say
i
liked
it
a
lot
is
an
understatement
and
then
i
tried
it
with
of
all
things
a
shoutout
girl
scout
cookie
for
those
that
dont
know
this
is
the
girl
scout
version
of
a
biscoff
speculaas
cookie
omg
this
made
the
beer
sing
the
clove
ginger
notes
really
played
up
the
sweeter
vanilla
undertones
of
the
beer
and
balanced
out
the
bitter
finish
i
think
it
would
be
marvelous
with
tikka
masala
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
it
has
some
characteristics
that
i
really
like
and
some
not
so
much
its
kind
of
weird
but
unique
one
second
im
loving
it
and
the
next
im
questioning
it
overall
its
not
bad
brought
some
bottles
home
from
an
obx
vacation
poured
into
a
chalice
glass
for
review
pours
a
very
dark
amber
wouldnt
have
known
if
not
held
up
to
the
light
otherwise
seems
black
nice
offwhite
head
with
lacing
that
clings
to
the
glass
smells
of
lactose
and
light
roast
some
subtle
chocolate
and
cocoa
hops
arent
evident
besides
bitterness
except
perhaps
a
woody
or
earthy
undertone
tastes
roasty
with
lactose
milk
and
a
nice
velvety
feel
that
coats
the
tongue
feels
mediumfull
bodied
but
drinks
ever
so
smooth
drinks
dry
as
theres
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
overall
a
very
nice
milk
stout
a
quality
beer
with
alcohol
well
in
check
o
the
look
and
the
feel
arent
great
but
this
is
quite
good
otherwise
if
this
was
readily
available
in
my
state
id
definitely
drink
it
again
not
bad
beer
poured
from
a
growler
into
a
16oz
glass
it
is
very
dark
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
aroma
is
just
not
there
you
cant
smell
the
lactose
but
thats
about
it
it
could
have
been
because
the
growler
was
about
10
days
old
saying
that
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
very
sweet
and
malty
the
lactose
takes
over
and
you
get
a
lot
of
it
up
front
in
the
back
end
you
get
hints
of
chocolate
and
it
is
very
sweet
it
goes
down
smooth
at
only
5
7
it
is
a
good
beer
in
any
situation
for
being
such
a
dark
beer
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
and
hits
all
the
high
points
of
the
style
recommendable
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
room
temperature
goblet
smell
is
sweet
hints
of
cocoa
deep
black
color
almost
no
head
first
sip
is
chocolate
and
milky
that
first
sip
is
very
enjoyable
an
adult
chocolate
milk
if
you
will
the
lactose
is
very
present
and
some
roasted
characteristics
come
through
as
well
as
the
chocolate
the
second
sip
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
that
is
where
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
comes
in
there
is
no
second
level
of
flavor
no
added
depth
to
take
it
from
a
good
beer
to
a
great
beer
i
would
however
drink
it
again
but
i
may
not
seek
it
out
bottom
line
ill
have
another
o
a
very
good
easy
drinking
milk
stout
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
fantastic
ending
would
recommend
87
typical
aroma
of
coffee
milk
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
coffee
french
vanilla
oatmeal
and
an
odd
note
of
plum
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
almost
like
syrup
just
a
bit
too
sweet
would
be
better
without
the
plum
a
decent
beer
recommended
overall
creamy
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
decent
beer
but
not
really
to
my
liking
would
drink
again
but
not
often
o
while
im
not
going
to
claim
duckrabbit
are
indeed
the
specialists
of
dark
beer
as
this
is
the
first
stout
ive
had
from
them
i
will
however
lay
claim
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
crafted
milksweet
stouts
america
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
has
to
offer
in
terms
of
keeping
it
below
6
abv
while
ive
enjoyed
many
bigger
milk
stouts
better
than
the
duckrabbit
i
cant
quite
get
over
how
well
made
it
really
is
nearly
all
the
milksweet
stouts
ive
had
have
had
top
shelf
flavors
but
i
just
couldnt
finish
them
due
to
the
intense
sweetness
but
these
guys
somehow
have
created
one
all
the
while
keeping
the
ridiculous
sweetness
and
rich
flavors
but
balancing
it
just
enough
to
get
me
through
the
entire
12
oz
bottle
very
good
milk
stout
and
worth
the
try
for
stout
lovers
and
rich
milky
sweet
stout
lovers
in
general
fine
as
milk
stouts
go
but
not
exceptional
would
not
turn
it
down
it
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
big
enough
body
but
i
feel
a
stout
this
style
included
could
use
a
little
more
of
it
not
the
greatest
drinking
milk
stout
thats
for
left
hand
but
its
a
good
showing
from
a
brewery
that
usually
disappoints
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
the
bottle
in
a
week
but
that
one
is
worth
drinking
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
and
thats
the
worst
of
it
almost
balanced
otherwise
a
pretty
decent
milk
stout
and
definitely
one
of
favorites
to
back
to
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
cheers
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
me
the
highlight
is
the
taste
o
overall
smooth
polished
in
smooth
much
like
their
porter
balanced
overall
duckrabbits
milk
stout
is
so
stylistically
sound
that
id
personally
like
to
give
every
beer
advocate
that
follows
the
friedrich
nietzsche
herding
theory
and
migrates
towards
the
modern
barrelaged
russian
imperial
stouts
a
bottle
of
this
brew
and
tell
them
to
go
learn
something
about
what
a
stout
really
is
absolutely
phenomenal
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
twelve
inch
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
globe
the
appearance
is
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
nice
two
finger
caramel
colored
head
a
little
retention
and
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
chocolate
is
the
predominant
note
there
are
other
things
too
but
my
nose
is
not
always
able
to
discern
what
and
all
is
there
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
and
a
little
syruppy
tasting
the
finish
is
a
nice
mild
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
not
a
game
changer
but
a
nice
offereing
o
a
solid
offering
thy
would
be
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
the
dark
fruit
and
melon
really
made
this
different
but
refreshing
i
like
that
it
was
not
as
rich
and
sweet
as
some
milk
stouts
but
it
really
had
simple
but
good
flavors
i
will
drink
this
again
for
sure
dam
so
wanted
to
taste
this
beer
and
what
a
disappointed
smells
boozy
taste
boozy
but
does
nothing
for
me
i
dont
to
drink
anything
by
duck
rabbit
any
more
yes
its
dark
but
i
dont
taste
anything
in
this
beer
that
makes
want
todrink
it
again
just
taste
like
a
high
octane
beer
read
the
othe
reviews
because
i
did
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
od
quite
simple
but
also
quite
nice
the
lacto
adds
a
nice
element
and
it
stays
balanced
and
doesnt
cloy
well
put
together
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
full
flavored
beer
other
than
a
slightly
thin
body
i
found
this
beer
fantastic
overall
not
bad
although
the
slightly
bitter
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
taste
which
didnt
meld
so
well
with
the
roasted
and
sweeter
lactose
tastes
takes
away
from
the
beer
a
bit
although
not
the
best
milk
stout
in
my
opinion
it
is
well
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
solid
milk
stout
sweet
and
creamy
overall
for
the
price
a
good
reliable
drinkable
stout
a
solid
milk
stout
with
interesting
malty
flavors
upper
class
if
not
for
some
attenuation
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
but
i
will
certainly
drink
the
other
two
bottles
of
it
that
came
as
part
of
the
beer
of
the
month
collection
overall
a
very
tasty
east
drinking
stout
that
has
a
black
coffee
like
bitterness
my
only
surprise
is
that
it
being
a
milk
stout
that
it
wasnt
a
tad
sweeter
not
a
complicated
stout
by
any
means
but
great
flavors
easy
drinking
stout
o
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
easy
and
can
be
considered
as
a
session
able
stout
received
a
12
oz
bottle
as
a
gift
from
magoo
poured
into
two
halfpint
glasses
dark
black
color
not
much
head
decent
lacing
though
nice
smell
of
dark
chocolate
taste
was
very
good
flavors
of
caramel
and
hot
cocoa
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
which
was
the
most
impressive
aspect
of
the
beer
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
this
brewerys
version
should
really
be
considered
one
of
the
benchmarks
overall
love
it
my
favorite
beer
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
fairly
local
to
me
but
ive
never
had
it
before
i
will
definitely
be
buying
some
more
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
small
head
with
low
retention
and
medium
lacing
it
smells
amazing
it
smells
amazingly
chocolately
and
almost
immediately
hoppy
the
initial
taste
is
coffee
and
then
roasted
malts
and
a
cascade
of
hops
it
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
i
love
this
beer
and
will
recommend
to
anyone
who
has
not
experienced
this
great
beer
from
eastern
north
carolina
overall
a
very
nice
stout
was
probably
looking
for
not
sweetness
and
creamy
notes
from
the
lactose
still
an
enjoyable
beer
though
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
i
have
been
enjoying
for
going
on
a
decade
now
and
one
that
i
missed
once
i
left
nc
for
northern
nj
there
is
a
nice
rich
flavor
and
aroma
to
the
beer
that
makes
it
very
enjoyable
and
it
has
just
enough
sweetness
and
low
enough
abv
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
for
the
winter
d
pretty
good
it
is
enjoyable
id
definitely
have
again
overall
i
a
decent
easy
drinking
stout
all
the
roasty
and
milky
flavors
are
there
as
you
expect
a
decent
brew
a
bit
dry
for
my
taste
but
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
nonetheless
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
very
nice
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
although
the
nose
isnt
that
great
i
think
the
taste
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
milk
stouts
ive
had
o
a
good
beer
nice
tasting
the
mouthfeelviscosity
needs
a
lot
if
improvement
to
call
this
great
though
and
it
might
prevent
me
from
buying
this
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
mentioned
above
i
would
suggest
atleast
giving
it
a
go
it
was
nice
and
something
i
am
not
really
used
to
t
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
covered
currants
which
lead
a
touch
of
tartness
some
watered
down
coffee
and
cola
nut
on
the
finish
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
but
still
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
o
delicious
everyday
stout
i
like
others
by
duck
rabbit
better
but
easily
see
why
this
is
their
most
marketable
beer
good
one
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
the
aroma
could
be
improved
but
its
a
solid
sweet
stout
o
nice
color
but
coffee
flavor
a
bit
overpowering
this
one
was
more
of
a
smokey
stout
than
a
milk
stout
the
smoke
really
took
away
from
the
lactose
the
sweet
had
almost
been
used
to
patch
up
the
smokiness
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
milk
stout
if
there
is
another
that
anyone
knows
of
that
is
similar
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
try
it
out
o
this
was
ok
but
left
something
to
be
desired
this
had
some
off
flavors
not
enough
to
ruin
the
beer
but
theres
some
flaws
here
worth
trying
but
my
first
experience
with
duckrabbit
was
less
than
stellar
do
its
fine
certainly
not
something
id
refuse
if
offered
but
i
feel
like
there
are
better
options
available
elsewhere
o
i
enjoy
that
this
beer
is
leans
towards
the
bitter
and
roast
side
but
there
are
several
flaws
that
should
be
corrected
before
i
could
appreciate
the
beer
and
raise
the
score
im
not
that
great
a
describing
the
off
flavors
and
aromas
i
sense
but
something
isnt
right
with
this
one
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
its
very
drinkable
for
sure
but
there
are
a
few
weaknesses
for
one
i
would
like
to
see
better
head
retention
and
lacing
also
the
taste
just
doesnt
have
as
much
complexity
as
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
milk
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
i
mostly
got
fruits
and
milk
sugar
finally
the
body
is
a
bit
too
light
for
a
stout
with
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
a
milk
stout
poured
from
bottle
into
nb
tulip
glass
has
a
dark
cola
appearance
very
little
head
not
great
smell
smells
like
dr
pepper
and
liquorice
not
much
else
taste
tea
leaves
liquorice
dr
pepper
with
a
metallic
and
bitter
ending
this
is
unremarkable
and
falls
short
of
my
standard
for
milk
stout
left
hand
ill
pour
this
out
in
favor
of
something
more
tasty
tonight
also
has
a
stingy
mouthfeel
not
many
great
redeeming
qualities
here
blah
not
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
there
o
overall
that
weird
metallic
taste
and
aroma
really
destroyed
this
beer
for
me
so
unfortunate
d
heavy
and
hearty
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
but
one
or
maybe
two
a
night
is
just
fine
after
finishing
this
up
i
was
definitely
in
need
of
a
pilsner
to
cleanse
the
palate
a
very
drinkable
sweet
stout
i
love
it
its
a
fairly
simple
beer
in
that
i
could
only
detect
a
couple
of
flavors
but
all
the
flavors
were
fully
developed
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
dont
drink
a
lot
of
stouts
as
the
sweetness
balances
out
the
malt
really
well
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
whenever
i
can
and
will
seek
out
other
duckrabbit
beers
hopefully
duckrabbit
will
be
distributed
in
fl
soon
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
session
stout
very
flavorful
which
makes
it
pretty
complex
in
comparison
to
most
milk
stouts
wish
we
got
this
around
nj
served
in
a
16oz
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
hazelnut
appearing
head
that
froths
and
then
disappears
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
rather
astringent
but
with
a
deep
coffee
character
the
body
was
rather
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
but
not
too
light
middle
of
the
road
i
would
say
taste
was
full
of
deep
roasted
malt
lots
of
coffee
flavors
that
carry
over
from
the
nose
lots
of
alcohol
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
the
taste
is
great
at
first
but
that
lactose
really
cuts
though
as
the
beer
warms
and
its
a
little
too
much
overall
its
a
bit
on
the
light
side
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
i
feel
like
the
carbonation
hides
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
and
the
presentation
is
uneventful
to
say
the
least
still
its
a
solid
brew
despite
and
one
id
recommend
for
the
price
but
probably
not
something
id
buy
regularly
anyway
maybe
someone
might
like
the
sour
chocolate
tones
of
this
beer
but
i
found
it
pretty
unpleasant
especially
when
expecting
something
else
smells
better
than
it
tasted
either
there
are
quality
control
issues
or
duck
rabbit
needs
to
address
why
this
isnt
up
to
par
with
what
i
would
expect
from
the
dark
beer
specialist
transparent
dark
brown
with
a
very
light
khaki
colored
head
smoked
sesame
seeds
milk
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
rolled
oats
odd
and
robust
sesame
seed
and
burnt
malt
tang
on
the
initial
sip
followed
by
smoother
tones
of
milk
chocolate
heavy
cream
and
oats
cleaner
drier
chocolaty
finish
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
brew
almost
tastes
like
it
went
sour
but
the
exp
date
is
this
year
o
ahhh
what
a
great
milk
stout
one
of
the
best
maybe
second
only
to
moloko
its
silky
smooth
creamy
and
loaded
with
chocolate
just
what
you
want
for
the
style
if
it
were
a
little
bit
of
a
bigger
beer
it
would
be
a
4
5
in
every
category
i
think
i
like
milk
stouts
generally
but
this
one
is
weird
i
smell
chocolate
and
coffee
and
toffee
like
id
expect
but
it
seems
a
little
too
carbonated
and
not
creamy
enough
for
me
and
strangely
enough
it
tastes
very
strongly
of
toasted
sesame
oil
seriouslythe
beer
tastes
just
like
asian
noodles
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
lactose
and
cream
notes
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
coffee
and
cream
notes
are
front
and
center
with
some
chocolate
and
light
to
medium
roasted
malt
also
thrown
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
overall
much
better
and
more
complex
than
expected
overall
im
fairly
impressed
at
this
one
after
trying
left
hand
and
lancaster
milk
stouts
the
duckrabbit
and
mikkeller
have
me
convinced
to
keep
trying
this
style
i
like
that
i
can
get
stout
aromas
and
flavors
without
getting
the
high
alcohol
content
of
an
imp
stout
a
very
tasty
brew
that
i
would
enjoy
again
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
it
had
just
about
everything
think
i
look
for
in
a
good
milk
stout
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
had
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
and
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
and
if
your
a
fan
of
milk
stouts
i
think
this
is
a
must
try
and
worth
the
effort
to
obtain
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
taste
they
were
right
where
they
should
be
at
for
the
style
and
i
liked
them
a
lot
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
much
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
and
if
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
less
carbonated
it
would
be
pretty
close
to
perfect
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
but
duckrabbit
isnt
distributed
in
michigan
so
who
knows
when
i
will
have
the
chance
to
try
to
this
beer
again
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
and
it
made
for
a
great
first
impression
for
this
brewery
i
am
glad
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
and
i
was
happy
that
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
good
job
duckrabbit
this
was
one
awesome
beer
and
you
can
bet
that
i
will
be
searching
out
more
of
your
brews
i
see
good
things
in
the
future
for
this
brewery
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
d
a
well
made
sweet
stout
from
the
dark
beer
specialist
im
not
mocking
that
cause
they
certainly
do
make
some
good
dark
beers
solid
offering
dark
brown
colour
ring
of
off
white
head
with
no
lace
left
behind
smell
is
milky
roasted
malts
lots
of
coffee
light
milk
chocolate
scents
as
well
as
some
nutty
notes
taste
is
of
sour
milk
and
roast
coffee
chocolate
milk
and
some
mild
bitterness
with
some
sweet
points
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
light
carbonation
with
a
fairly
light
body
not
bad
and
glad
to
have
tried
this
would
like
to
try
something
else
from
these
guys
as
opposed
to
coming
back
to
this
one
though
sour
milk
stout
highly
lactic
yogurt
suggested
improvement
is
to
regain
control
over
that
beyond
that
aspect
a
decent
drinker
of
milk
and
coffee
soso
not
one
i
would
again
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
topping
coffee
aroma
suitable
carbonation
thanks
ken
the
palate
is
dry
but
flavorfully
roasty
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
in
il
somewhere
o
a
good
milk
stout
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
my
local
example
lancaster
brewing
milk
stout
but
few
do
another
solid
effort
for
duck
rabbit
thanks
redliner8
hahahahha
i
found
this
beer
simple
but
in
a
good
way
i
enjoyed
the
texture
and
the
over
all
taste
was
interesting
enough
that
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
easily
had
another
for
sure
a
kick
back
stout
that
does
require
you
to
think
about
it
cost
8
99
for
a
six
pack
o
this
is
the
best
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
worth
my
trip
to
raleigh
to
try
it
overall
i
would
go
back
to
this
beer
but
i
might
wait
until
i
try
all
that
is
out
there
first
but
i
certainly
dont
regret
the
second
bottle
in
the
fridge
that
i
know
my
girlfriend
will
not
drink
drinkability
i
could
consume
this
stout
all
night
long
while
theres
nothing
particularly
moving
about
it
it
has
a
good
priceperformance
ratio
and
is
easy
to
drink
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
its
not
best
of
breed
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
solid
dependable
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
and
to
serve
again
and
again
o
i
liked
this
milk
stout
quite
a
bit
it
was
certainly
creamy
and
smooth
and
had
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
was
far
from
cloying
the
flavor
wasnt
as
bold
or
robust
as
some
others
within
the
style
but
was
still
a
delicious
blend
of
chocolate
and
roasty
character
overall
this
beer
fits
right
in
with
the
style
and
is
one
i
intend
to
try
again
soon
cheers
o
a
tasty
wellmade
beer
i
have
been
a
fan
of
duck
rabbit
for
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
last
decade
that
i
got
my
hands
on
some
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout
very
few
i
can
think
of
that
i
might
be
able
to
drink
an
entire
sixer
of
but
this
is
one
of
em
great
brunt
malt
smell
with
just
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
very
smooth
light
body
that
really
compliments
the
taste
like
many
people
i
too
wish
i
could
pick
this
up
in
ny
maybe
some
day
overy
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
around
iowa
i
like
this
beer
i
think
it
has
a
good
mix
of
sweet
ad
bitter
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
especially
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
the
style
i
recommend
it
i
picked
this
one
up
on
a
recent
holiday
journey
i
dont
have
access
to
a
ton
of
milk
stouts
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
good
i
really
like
genuine
milk
stouts
and
this
is
one
that
is
nicelycrafted
and
relatively
easy
to
find
its
not
on
the
same
level
as
3f
moloko
but
its
a
heckuvalot
cheaper
and
a
heckuvalot
easier
to
find
if
you
like
milk
stouts
dont
pass
this
one
up
overall
a
decent
stout
if
you
do
not
want
to
get
too
crazy
or
just
want
something
lite
to
end
the
night
with
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
malty
but
a
decent
beer
to
start
off
ones
stout
career
with
a
good
pub
brew
as
i
stated
previously
being
from
nc
i
tend
to
find
this
brew
at
just
about
every
bar
with
a
decent
beer
selection
and
makes
a
good
default
beer
to
rely
on
for
a
good
night
out
as
milk
stouts
and
imperial
stouts
seem
to
be
rolling
out
with
the
new
year
from
all
over
the
country
i
highly
suggest
finding
this
dark
ale
as
a
peer
to
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
roasty
flavors
makes
this
one
of
the
most
balanced
sweetmilk
stouts
i
have
tried
very
nice
o
i
only
have
high
expecations
from
this
brewery
as
i
have
not
yet
had
a
beer
that
dissapointed
me
and
i
was
really
stoked
when
i
got
this
as
an
extra
i
havent
had
too
many
milk
stouts
but
from
the
few
that
i
have
had
this
is
probably
one
of
better
examples
i
will
definitely
try
to
trade
for
this
beer
again
overall
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
but
the
overall
smell
and
taste
arent
all
that
exciting
still
good
though
o
good
stuff
a
nice
sessionable
at
5
7
milk
stout
that
packs
in
plenty
of
flavor
without
all
the
weight
overall
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
beer
still
very
drinkable
and
tasty
but
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
more
bitterness
than
i
would
have
expected
which
i
like
though
all
together
this
doesnt
show
a
whole
lot
of
depth
of
flavor
ive
paired
this
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
the
two
are
an
excellent
match
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
glad
to
try
it
solid
effort
ok
thats
enough
quit
reading
my
review
and
go
get
this
beer
if
it
is
soldout
it
is
probably
because
i
was
just
at
the
store
and
picked
up
every
six
pack
of
it
that
they
had
o
overall
ive
noticed
a
certain
signature
flavor
in
duck
rabbit
brews
and
this
beer
has
it
pretty
solid
milk
stout
nice
treat
good
robust
flavors
o
a
really
solid
milk
stout
its
great
to
see
this
variation
of
stout
being
represented
here
it
is
an
underappreciated
style
that
when
done
like
this
makes
for
a
great
session
stout
o
duck
rabbit
is
an
east
coast
brewery
that
never
disappoints
me
this
beer
really
is
great
and
stands
to
its
name
give
it
a
shot
overall
a
very
enjoyable
milk
stout
might
be
a
touch
too
sweet
for
some
but
definitely
recommended
owill
definitely
drink
again
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
watery
but
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
overall
enjoyment
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
im
glad
its
readily
available
here
locally
o
an
average
milk
stout
but
nothing
more
than
that
if
given
the
opportunity
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
still
it
was
decently
enjoyable
o
very
good
milk
stout
with
a
nice
balance
of
milkiness
to
go
along
with
the
chocolates
and
coffee
flavors
of
a
stout
bitter
of
the
hops
is
well
covered
but
just
enough
hints
to
balance
nicely
the
milk
chocolate
creaminess
starts
to
become
more
evident
as
this
warms
taking
this
from
being
a
pretty
good
beer
to
a
damn
good
beer
the
color
wasnt
bad
thats
not
saying
much
though
o
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
even
if
stouts
arent
normally
your
thing
mouthfeel
not
high
carbonation
but
not
thick
either
light
enough
to
be
consumed
easily
but
not
heavy
enough
to
promote
any
real
stout
flavors
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
or
toffee
and
some
coffee
aromas
taste
is
of
toastedroasted
dark
malt
coffee
grounds
and
some
sweet
lactose
flavors
a
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
tasty
milk
stout
o
overall
a
great
tasting
milk
stout
can
hold
its
own
against
left
hand
wish
we
got
this
in
nashville
pours
black
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
the
head
lingers
for
a
little
but
dissipates
as
you
drink
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
and
is
almost
like
a
cold
mocha
cappuccino
drinks
easy
and
feels
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
has
low
carbonation
it
tastes
almost
like
a
cold
cappuccino
that
is
of
good
quality
a
good
beer
after
a
long
day
of
work
really
a
well
done
beer
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
of
everything
i
enjoy
in
a
stout
going
on
overall
a
really
solid
milk
stout
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
the
style
o
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
milk
stout
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
think
this
brew
is
quite
good
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
overall
i
was
really
happy
with
this
beer
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
milk
stouts
and
if
i
can
get
again
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
cheers
oan
interesting
milk
stout
but
overall
one
with
flaws
the
strong
alcohol
is
too
much
for
this
style
oa
i
like
it
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
i
could
sit
and
drink
it
but
if
you
switched
it
with
a
left
hand
ms
i
probably
wouldnt
notice
it
overall
just
too
much
fruit
for
me
and
it
really
takes
away
from
the
sweetened
coffeeespresso
flavors
i
expect
in
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
its
lacking
the
sweetness
normally
associated
with
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
intense
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
great
beer
overall
nicely
done
presentation
of
this
style
flavors
are
solid
and
not
overly
sweet
for
the
style
cheers
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
it
borderlines
on
beging
too
coffee
and
roasted
malt
dominiant
for
my
tastes
but
the
milk
sugar
definitely
helps
to
temper
and
add
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
saturday
morning
of
homecoming
weekend
and
it
made
the
perfect
breakfest
beer
to
start
out
the
day
thanks
again
brian
it
is
an
awesome
beer
all
around
and
will
be
one
of
my
new
go
to
stouts
pours
a
dark
brown

a
sliver
of
a
cocoa

decent
lacing
on
this
brew
nose
is
that
of
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
milk
and
some
mild
hops
not
bad
and
pretty
much
on
point
for
the
style
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
nose
full
bodied
feel
for
the
style
smooth
like
silk
w
a
mild
hop
bitternesscoffee
bitterness
in
the
background
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
and
i
would
drink
this
again
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
the
feeling
i
would
never
drink
a
finer
beer
in
a
certain
style
this
is
possibly
the
finest
possible
achievement
in
this
style
if
you
love
your
taste
buds
treat
them
to
this
it
is
what
it
is
its
decent
i
didnt
enjoy
it
much
but
i
wouldnt
be
against
having
another
bottle
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
which
i
really
dont
care
for
pitch
black
pour
nice
light
tan
head
forms
up
and
lingers
around
with
some
decent
lacing
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
some
coffee
in
the
nose
milk
chocolate
makes
its
presence
as
well
robust
rich
and
roasty
taste
coffee
chocolate
malts
and
ginger
root
merge
together
nicely
nice
mild
and
creamy
sweetness
not
too
overwhelming
like
many
other
milk
stouts
out
there
bit
of
tobacco
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
overall
one
of
my
favorites
time
and
time
again
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
prime
offering
from
the
great
state
of
nc
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
pours
jet
black
with
just
under
two
fingers
of
caramel
colored
foam
crowning
it
retention
is
alright
the
head
cuts
itself
in
half
pretty
quickly
but
lingers
for
a
long
time
the
ring
of
lacing
left
around
the
top
of
the
glass
isnt
quite
solid
but
its
pretty
full
and
nice
looking
nonetheless
the
nose
is
very
heavy
on
coffee
and
vanilla
with
those
two
coming
together
to
smell
like
coffee
thats
had
a
healthy
bit
of
cream
added
to
it
the
flavor
is
again
centered
around
coffee
and
vanilla
but
they
dont
integrate
and
fill
my
palate
as
well
as
they
do
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
comes
across
as
a
little
too
dry
and
theres
a
spot
mid
palate
thats
just
begging
for
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
that
never
comes
despite
the
somewhat
dry
flavor
the
body
itself
is
nice
and
full
the
carbonations
just
a
little
too
active
for
its
own
good
though
taking
away
from
the
malty
center
of
the
beer
at
times
in
general
ive
really
liked
the
duck
rabbit
beers
ive
had
and
while
the
milk
stout
is
good
the
high
expectations
i
have
for
their
beers
now
werent
quite
met
o
was
wanting
more
of
a
sweetmilky
taste
and
it
didnt
happen
for
me
a
little
too
much
coffee
flavor
more
like
a
watered
down
stout
than
a
milk
stout
while
it
was
okay
im
not
sure
i
will
pick
up
anymore
overall
drinkability
a
little
too
thin
bodied
and
one
dimensional
in
the
taste
has
the
skeleton
of
a
mmilk
stout
but
doesnt
flesh
it
out
with
the
desired
characters
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
a
solid
offering
from
duck
rabbit
mediumbodied
start
with
a
light
effervescence
slight
wateriness
finishes
lighter
than
it
starts
aftertaste
is
like
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
cigarette
in
it
and
i
hate
both
of
those
things
wont
be
having
this
again
mouthfeeloverall
body
is
medium
with
very
fine
carbonation
starts
out
a
bit
less
than
creamy
when
cold
but
as
it
warms
does
obtain
that
creaminess
excellent
overall
i
was
very
pleased
to
try
this
beer
milk
stouts
are
one
of
my
under
the
radar
favorites
and
this
is
a
great
example
would
definitely
have
again
o
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
i
like
it
better
as
i
do
with
many
beers
as
it
begins
to
warm
a
bit
the
flavors
become
richer
and
much
more
noticeable
as
the
temperature
rises
o
really
nice
stout
recommended
very
drinkable
if
a
bit
bitter
id
love
to
have
another
overall
an
excellent
beer
sorry
this
isnt
available
in
the
midwest
a
really
nice
beer
not
a
huge
booming
stout
by
any
means
but
a
bit
of
an
easy
drinker
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
but
perhaps
lacking
in
the
creaminess
youd
expect
from
a
milk
stout
solid
though
o
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
so
underwhelming
tons
of
coffee
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
here
creamy
mouthfeel
not
really
that
much
to
write
or
brag
about
here
average
at
best
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
this
is
my
first
milk
stout
and
i
loved
it
will
be
seeking
more
of
this
beer
and
of
the
style
a
medium
to
light
bodied
stout
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
interesting
approach
overall
good
enough
but
not
great
o
clearly
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
come
back
and
try
this
again
next
time
i
can
find
a
bottle
o
strong
flavored
slick
bodied
brew
fairly
deep
flavors
proportioned
appropriately
o
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
company
ive
heard
good
things
about
seems
like
a
middle
of
the
road
milk
stout
that
doesnt
really
pull
me
towards
liking
it
or
hating
it
maybe
with
a
few
small
tweaks
this
would
be
a
bigger
draw
pours
dark
brown
to
the
point
of
black
but
has
very
little
head
about
a
single
layer
of
tan
bubbles
that
dissipates
quickly
a
small
amount
of
wet
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
smell
is
of
white
cane
sugar
roasted
malt
coffee
grounds
and
some
chocolate
taste
is
similar
with
some
sugar
in
the
front
the
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
some
roastiness
almost
a
char
flavor
on
the
finish
perhaps
a
touch
of
vanilla
on
the
exhale
as
well
not
very
complex
as
all
the
flavors
seem
to
be
right
up
front
but
still
enjoyable
mouth
is
very
smooth
with
the
carbonation
dancing
nicely
off
the
tongue
overall
a
very
quaffable
milk
stout
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
thanks
again
jay
looking
forward
to
enjoying
the
other
one
you
sent
o
a
perfect
looking
stout
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
just
great
when
comparing
to
left
hand
milk
stout
i
think
i
like
left
hands
taste
a
little
more
but
duck
rabbit
as
a
whole
gets
the
edge
because
of
the
incredible
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
of
this
beer
o
i
feel
bad
reviewing
this
beer
im
guessing
my
bottle
may
have
been
old
or
compromised
in
transportation
no
dent
on
the
trader
hes
a
great
guy
and
bought
this
beer
only
a
month
or
two
ago
id
be
glad
to
retry
this
incredibly
fresh
but
until
then
not
touching
this
beer
again
o
this
is
an
excellent
milk
stout
and
one
i
would
be
buying
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
in
my
area
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
good
stout
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
sitting
around
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
one
last
final
note
it
tastes
like
a
lighter
version
of
2011
kbs
not
real
sure
if
thats
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
o
overall
not
a
bad
milk
stout
a
little
thin
and
not
very
complex
easy
drinking
and
could
be
considered
a
session
stout
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
a
drinkable
milk
stout
i
like
the
coffee
and
vanilla
qualities
very
filling
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
with
good
availability
in
my
area
i
recommend
trying
it
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
again
and
this
time
enjoy
it
the
stout
pours
black
with
a
hue
of
red
it
also
gives
off
an
aroma
of
sweet
milk
bready
malt
and
slight
raisin
as
for
taste
it
is
extremely
tasty
it
has
a
dark
chocolate
roast
sweet
milk
and
some
nuttyness
for
mouthfeel
it
is
extremely
smooth
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
a
milk
stout
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
sweetness
like
most
milk
stouts
but
a
slight
sweetness
that
accentuates
sweetness
of
the
malt
i
would
definitely
love
to
try
the
coffee
infused
version
of
this
o
a
solid
milk
stout
by
a
solid
brewery
very
enjoyable
ill
have
to
try
and
snag
some
more
in
the
cooler
weather
i
picture
a
fire
pit
and
cigar
o
overall
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
while
cooking
in
the
kitchen
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
another
winner
from
duck
rabbit
i
really
hope
they
make
their
way
to
middle
tennessee
soon
anybody
know
of
a
great
imperial
stout
with
the
texture
and
mouthfeel
of
a
milk
stout
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
strong
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
coats
your
mouth
well
but
vanishes
somewhat
quickly
the
carbonation
is
not
prickly
at
all
but
instead
adds
a
creaminess
that
combines
nicely
with
the
flavors
o
very
solid
offering
i
believe
they
do
know
how
to
make
their
dark
beers
cheers
a
very
nice
smoky
milk
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
main
complaint
is
the
thin
mouthfeel
i
like
how
the
smoked
flavors
combine
well
with
the
dark
malts
and
the
sweetness
all
in
all
pretty
good
not
aggressively
roasted
like
some
others
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
stout
o
overall
a
very
nice
milk
stout
that
i
wish
was
distributed
to
oh
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
while
visiting
a
friend
in
ga
o
solid
stout
i
would
drink
this
again
well
brewed
fellows
overall
a
worthy
contender
especially
if
you
like
a
bolder
hop
profile
in
your
stouts
i
wish
i
could
replicate
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
in
some
others
pours
a
pitch
very
dark
brown
with
billowing
tan
head
slowly
settles
leaving
a
whole
bunch
of
styrofoamy
lace
on
the
glass
smell
sweet
very
mild
roast
and
coffee
edging
towards
brown
bread
and
raisins
taste
milk
chocolate
with
raisins
mild
roast
grainy
twang
feel
is
a
little
bit
more
carbonated
that
id
like
medium
bodied
earthy
and
sweet
but
unexpectedly
drying
finish
pretty
nice
beer
overall
notched
as
best
by

dec
2011
o
a
good
milk
stout
but
not
my
favorite
a
little
thin
for
the
style
o
my
favorite
milk
stout
to
date
has
a
great
flavor
with
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
i
could
session
this
all
night
thought
it
certainly
is
not
what
is
thought
of
as
a
session
beer
creamy
and
smooth
pours
very
dark
beautiful
with
a
nice
milky
head
smells
lightly
toasted
with
a
nice
sweetness
tastes
very
roasted
at
first
but
then
mid
thru
finish
is
sweet
mouth
feel
was
slightly
heavy
to
mid
laces
very
well
very
much
enjoyed
the
stout
the
body
was
fairly
typical
full
without
being
heavy
and
nicely
smooth
with
a
fair
bit
of
bubbly
effervescence
on
the
tongue
drinkability
was
good
and
easy
overall
a
nice
little
brew
thats
worth
trying
when
you
can
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
big
sweetness
followed
by
a
rather
big
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
think
it
is
too
extreme
on
both
ends
but
it
is
above
average
beer
and
if
you
like
your
stouts
to
have
a
big
full
roasted
flavor
then
this
is
your
beer
o
very
interesting
with
more
bitterness
then
i
expected
i
was
expecting
more
sweet
flavors
but
i
enjoyed
this
overall
and
really
dug
the
dark
malt
and
earthiness
the
milk
stout
pours
out
of
the
bottle
as
a
dark
creamy
looking
black
liquid
the
head
is
a
nice
shade
of
brown
that
looks
pretty
thick
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
heavily
roasted
and
had
some
sweet
creamy
malt
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
rich
with
chocolate
malts
and
some
burnt
toast
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
leaving
a
creamy
oily
feeling
in
th
mouth
which
i
liked
a
lot
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
stout
i
would
drink
this
one
again
overall
definitely
a
goto
milk
stout
for
me
i
like
to
compare
it
to
the
left
hand
brewerys
milk
stout
with
duck
rabbits
being
more
coffee
based
while
left
hands
being
more
sweetness
not
exactly
an
educated
opinion
but
mine
nonetheless
overall
an
ok
beer
probably
would
have
it
again
just
wont
seek
it
out
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
actually
pretty
good
but
it
just
didnt
quite
impress
me
as
a
milk
stout
there
is
no
sweetness
whatsoever
its
nothing
more
than
a
regular
stout
o
decent
milk
stout
just
outstanding
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
milkstouts
ive
ever
had
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
only
more
pronounced
lots
of
malty
and
chocolate
flavor
here
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
offering
o
overall
a
good
milk
stout
that
suffers
a
bit
from
having
too
much
carbonation
in
the
body
and
bitter
roasted
malts
present
in
the
flavor
profile
still
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
o
overall
pretty
good
it
lost
a
little
of
its
creaminess
as
it
warmed
but
there
was
a
sweet
chocolate
flavor
that
worked
well
tasty
stuff
o
this
is
fantastic
like
all
other
duckrabbit
stouts
o
solid
milk
stout
probably
the
best
yearround
release
from
duckrabbit
od
easy
drinking
as
a
milk
stout
should
be
the
harsh
roasting
does
start
to
add
a
little
bit
of
a
edge
abv
is
very
manageable
do
drinkability
is
very
good
easy
to
put
away
and
very
satisfying
overall
a
great
sweet
stout
not
the
best
looking
or
feeling
but
the
taste
will
win
you
over
easily
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
was
not
overly
sweet
definitely
a
dessert
type
beer
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
the
one
i
did
have
was
enjoyable
standard
milk
stout
and
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
poured
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
about
halfway
through
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
as
was
the
taste
with
traces
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
somewhat
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
despite
the
decent
color
and
a
bit
of
a
stale
and
bitter
finish
it
was
kind
of
difficult
to
get
all
the
way
through
this
stout
perhaps
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
but
it
didnt
make
a
good
impression
on
me
m
creamy
smooth
but
with
some
tingle
from
carbonation
sip
close
your
eyes
and
savor
o
sort
of
underwhelming
i
expect
milk
stouts
to
be
a
lot
thicker
and
more
lactic
the
components
are
there
but
just
seem
not
to
be
showcased
overalla
stout
that
boasts
a
wellbalanced
not
overwhelming
bite
perfect
for
year
round
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
overall
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
roasty
smooth
and
creamy
with
good
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
finish
would
be
a
good
choice
to
have
with
some
desert
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
i
received
this
beer
as
an
extra
from
alexfields
thanks
for
the
opportunity
poured
in
to
a
wine
glass
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
pours
out
a
black
color
with
brown
hues
at
the
top
of
the
glass
towards
the
head
which
is
about
an
inch
thick
the
nose
is
soft
with
notes
of
lactose
milk
chocolate
aspirin
and
a
small
hint
of
coffee
bean
smooth
drinking
here
the
body
is
like
silk
and
goes
down
incredibly
easy
not
too
thick
either
making
it
a
beer
you
can
put
two
to
three
back
of
this
is
a
style
that
i
rarely
buy
but
when
i
do
i
am
reminded
of
what
i
am
missing
out
on
this
beer
is
right
next
to
my
other
favorite
within
this
style
from
left
hand
overall
nothing
to
get
excited
over
or
to
write
home
about
but
a
decent
brew
nontheless
much
better
than
the
porter
i
just
had
which
was
nice
this
brewery
claims
to
be
the
dark
beer
specialist
and
the
milk
stout
has
slightly
redeemed
them
after
the
abomination
of
a
porter
so
ill
give
it
one
more
shot
before
blowing
the
whistle
maybe
something
imperial
next
time
this
one
was
decent
but
nothing
more
o
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
these
tend
to
be
too
sweet
for
me
at
times
and
can
be
rather
offputting
not
this
one
really
nice
and
definitely
sessionable
pours
black
with
a
nice
head
looks
really
inviting
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
along
with
that
slight
twinge
of
lactic
sweetness
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
punch
in
the
face
of
the
lactic
sweetness
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
quite
a
bit
going
on
as
it
carries
through
with
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
coffee
cream
finishes
with
a
really
clear
dead
on
flavor
that
is
really
pleasing
best
flavor
and
complexity
of
a
milk
stout
i
can
recall
having
assuming
we
dont
count
surly
4
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
for
a
beer
of
this
size
overall
i
am
really
impressed
i
am
always
really
impressed
when
beers
under
6
can
bring
the
flavor
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
pretty
floored
that
i
am
giving
this
beer
such
a
high
grade
o
very
easy
initial
drinking
its
like
a
dessert
beer
there
are
some
interesting
flavors
there
after
awhile
the
sweetness
takes
over
and
its
time
to
move
along
overall
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
and
drinks
as
such
color
is
black
with
some
brown
around
the
edges
the
tan
head
is
pretty
thin
and
fades
quickly
and
there
is
not
much
lacing
down
the
glass
the
scent
is
really
sweet
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
as
well
but
overpowering
more
of
a
bittersweet
cocoa
with
a
bit
of
coffee
mouthfeel
felt
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
to
me
i
enjoyed
this
stout
more
as
i
emptied
the
glass
and
it
warmed
a
bit
d
really
nice
mil
stout
here
as
previously
mentioned
not
uber
complex
but
what
is
there
is
rich
and
delicious
this
is
my
introduction
to
this
brewery
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
d
mediumhigh
its
very
sweet
which
is
typical
of
the
style
duck
rabbit
is
one
of
the
best
representations
of
a
milk
stout
ive
tried
d
this
is
solid
stout
has
some
nice
flavor
a
little
sweetness
in
the
finish
its
a
very
easy
drink
just
about
a
session
beer
definitely
a
solid
beer
overall
overall
a
little
disappointed
wont
be
a
go
to
for
me
when
hankerin
for
a
milk
stout
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
quality
of
the
beers
in
north
carolina
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
eager
to
try
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
a
sweet
but
not
at
all
syrupy
stout
excellent
for
your
after
dinner
dessert
when
tasting
this
excellent
example
of
a
creammilk
stout
you
dont
get
the
sense
that
the
brewer
used
cheap
tricks
to
obtain
the
flavors
and
results
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
d
my
favorite
milk
stout
that
about
sums
it
up
good
moderate
mouth
light
carbonation
bite
on
the
back
end
but
nothing
that
draws
too
much
away
from
the
creamy
feel
good
roasted
malts
sweet
dairy
sugars
light
vanilla
this
isnt
as
bold
as
i
would
expect
coming
from
a
fresh
keg
but
its
still
good
easy
drinking
stout
one
that
i
never
have
a
problem
with
ordering
good
stuff
d
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
either
i
imagine
imperialized
this
beer
is
very
nice
as
it
stands
the
beer
tastes
a
little
off
balance
and
lacking
in
some
more
substantial
interweaving
of
profiles
d
nicely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
a
sound
and
solid
milk
stout
not
a
perfect
one
but
a
decent
measuring
stick
for
the
style
overall
this
stout
is
superb
one
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
up
to
this
point
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
will
leave
you
wanting
another
pours
almost
black
with
1
12
half
fingers
of
brown
foamy
head
it
smells
like
coffee
chocolate
and
toffee
great
mouth
feel
for
a
stout
no
sour
mucky
after
taste
the
flavor
is
dark
and
toasty
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
but
not
so
complex
that
its
hard
to
drink
this
is
great
beer
that
leaves
a
creaminess
on
your
tongue
light
mouthfeel
which
i
would
prefer
a
little
thicker
but
good
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
t
typical
stout
theres
a
hint
of
alcohol
bubbly
on
the
tongue
nice
even
if
pedantic
at
the
moment
my
1
stout
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
would
be
good
with
desert
d
of
course
its
a
milk
stout
overall
this
is
an
above
average
milk
stout
but
nothing
exceptional
dnot
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
previous
characteristics
this
one
is
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
perfect
carbonation
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
very
tasty
drinkable
milk
stout
from
duck
rabbit
claiming
to
be
the
dark
beer
specialists
this
one
had
to
be
good
they
certainly
delivered
d
although
milk
stouts
are
not
my
first
choice
i
didnt
find
this
one
undrinkalbe
the
lactose
flavor
is
just
a
little
overpowering
but
the
initial
roasted
flavor
was
nice
cheers
cheers
d
decent
drinkability
maybe
a
tad
bit
too
filling
for
a
dessert
beer
excellent
drinkability
i
think
i
have
found
a
milk
stout
that
i
actually
like
gonna
have
to
be
something
spectacular
to
knock
this
off
the
pedestal
drinkability
a
great
stout
and
a
superior
beer
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
stouts
the
craftsmanship
is
definitely
evident
in
the
flavors
of
this
beer
i
will
certainly
look
for
it
again
and
highly
recommend
it
i
didnt
suffer
through
this
beer
but
i
think
that
more
than
2
would
be
a
bit
much
d
solid
all
around
not
my
favorite
style
but
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
recommended
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
not
something
that
id
really
care
to
have
again
mediocre
or
worse
in
just
about
all
phases
poured
aggressively
1
5finger
head
reduces
to
impressive
thin

as
well
as
the
awesome
lacing
color
is
black
head
is
caramel
aroma
of
perfectly
roasted
dark
malts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
of
the
chocolate
and
dark

is
fantastic
balanced
perfectly
with

maybe
a
touch
of
smoke
unbelievably
smoothdrinking
very
enjoyable
mine
served
as
a
nice
nightcap
at
this
abv
very
drinkable
if
youve
never
had
this
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
this
one
a
try
if
youre
a
stout
fan
youll
die
when
you
try
it
if
youre
not
much
of
the
fan
like
me
i
still
suggest
you
give
it
a
tryyou
may
love
it
highly
drinkable
but
a
little
short
on
robust
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
duckrabbit
milk
stout
it
is
tremendously
tasty
the
beer
was
an
almost
pitch
black
viscous
topped
with
a
thin
beige
layer
of
foam
the
smell
was
fairly
mild
with
a
little
roast
coffee
and
burnt
toast
but
the
taste
is
where
the
money
is
at
it
was
well
bittered
with
notes
of
dark
rum
milk
chocolate
iced
coffee
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
a
full
bodied
creamy
texture
it
was
delicious
certainly
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
i
drank
4
or
5
bottles
of
this
one
night
watching
football
without
really
realizing
because
it
was
so
good
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
wanting
something
better
goes
down
very
easy
but
leaves
my
tastebuds
wanting
something
more
complex
needs
more
coffee
taste
to
suit
me
d
all
in
all
im
a
little
disappointed
but
its
not
bad
its
a
creamy
stout
id
rather
drink
duck
rabbits
porter
d
not
a
bad
beer
didnt
mind
drinking
it
and
would
have
it
again
if
offered
smooth
feel
with
a
medium
body
and
rather
heavy
on
the
carbonation
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
clean
dry
tasty
but
after
a
couple
pints
id
probably
like
to
switch
it
up
a
little
dunremarkable
d
something
didnt
feel
balanced
this
one
didnt
taste
very
smooth
and
i
probably
wouldnt
have
another
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
first
beer
from
this
brewery
61st
this
beer
is
delicious
simply
put
the
finish
is
clean
but
leaves
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
more
i
will
gladly
trade
for
more
of
this
beer
definitely
seek
out
drinkability
is
not
bad
with
the
low
abv
and
all
and
this
beer
is
def
not
repulsive
drinkability
is
pretty
good
bold
strong
flavors
but
light
delivery
smooth
a
little
creamy
nice
dry
finish
and
overall
drier
feel
with
just
a
hint
of
a
sticky
feel
d
all
in
all
i
would
say
its
not
bad
quite
drinkable
but
probably
would
not
have
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
between
bitter
coffee
and
sweet
chocolates
creamy
but
not
thick
good
stout
d
the
5
7
abv
and
relative
lack
of
lactose
flavoring
make
this
an
unconventional
milk
stout
for
me
i
would
even
consider
it
to
be
more
bitter
than
sweet
but
at
the
least
its
a
nice
roasted
bitter
and
drinkable
stout
somewhere
between
a
true
american
and
specialty
stout
id
give
the
duckrabbit
another
try
maybe
ontap
or
cask
though
i
dont
typically
drink
stouts
but
this
one
puts
me
right
where
i
need
to
be
youd
think
it
would
be
a
little
heavier
alcoholwise
but
it
aint
a
prob
im
not
trying
to
get
wasted
while
im
drinking
some
this
good
spot
on
duck
rabbit
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
dark
color
almost
like
an
untainted
cup
of
freshly
brewed
coffee
was
very
appealing
it
poured
about
a
two
finger
wide
head
that
had
a
toffeeish
hue
to
it
the
aroma
was
strong
with
a
roasted
coffee
smell
on
first
taste
it
was
a
blast
of
flavors
you
definitely
get
the
coffee
flavor
at
first
followed
by
a
rich
caramel
and
ending
with
a
slightly
bitter
semisweet
dark
chocolate
throughout
the
whole
experience
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
to
it
i
definitely
recommend
this
stout
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
ok
retention
but
really
poor
lacing
a
light
roasted
aroma
laced
with
creamy
can
just
tell
its
milky
the
taste
is
also
very
creamy
but
a
stale
bitter
old
coffee
presents
which
is
really
distracting
it
was
probably
meant
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
needs
to
be
brought
down
by
half
prety
boring
drinker
poured
black
into
my
glass
i
get
hints
of
cream
when
i
take
a
big
whiff
tastes
like
a
stout
with
more
hints
of
cream
like
i
can
taste
the
lactose
with
the
way
its
carbonated
though
i
sometimes
feel
like
im
drinking
a
soda
the
concept
of
a
milk
stout
is
very
intriguing
though
and
i
feel
like
theduckrabbit
has
pulled
it
off
very
well
since
i
do
get
hints
of
a
milk
like
flavor
medium
body
a
bit
creamy
good
carbonation
so
easy
to
drink
great
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
chocolate
roast
and
a
tiny
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
brings
on
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
the
feel
bringing
on
a
pretty
good
dose
of
lactose
drinks
fairly
well
but
isnt
too
interesting
d
damn
good
sweet
stout
here
would
be
an
everyday
winter
staple
were
i
inside
of
duckrabbits
extremely
limited
distribution
range
d
i
like
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
score
well
tastes
pretty
good
drinkability
a
basic
combination
of
flavors
and
the
style
is
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
overall
i
found
this
to
be
rather
enjoyable
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
redbrown
colour
and
very
good
carbonation
the
head
died
of
quickly
in
mine
that
was
unexpected
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
the
initial
flavour
is
strong
and
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
there
is
some
hop
flavour
in
the
middle
the
aftertaste
is
milky
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointing
nose
is
a
nice
marriage
of
roasty
and
sweet
plentiful
dark
malts
with
chocoalte
milk
and
malted
milk
balls
the
flavor
scale
tips
more
toward
the
roasted
end
of
things
plentiful
dry
dark
malts
up
front
and
lingering
at
the
finish
chocolate
sweetness
is
controlled
and
challenged
by
a
fairly
stinging
dose
of
bitterness
fluffy
and
fairly
thick
could
perhaps
could
use
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
fit
more
neatly
into
the
style
but
theres
no
doubt
its
tasty
recommended
d
certain
allnighter
would
be
good
alone
or
with
food
pours
black
but
under
the
light
is
almost
ruby
great
sweet
and
roasted
smell
the
taste
doesnt
let
down
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
i
want
to
call
it
sharp
each
aspect
is
very
pronounced
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
very
strong
still
it
has
a
sweetness
the
carbonation
hits
hard
as
well
what
a
great
stout
comes
across
as
a
little
stronger
than
5
7
id
probably
only
be
able
to
rock
2
of
these
at
a
time
d
smooth
not
bad
for
a
stout
d
no
if
this
ever
is
opened
in
front
of
me
again
i
will
only
sip
it
if
im
promised
these
awful
metal
flavors
are
gone
there
is
something
disgusting
about
this
beer
and
i
hope
it
isnt
intentional
if
i
had
no
taste
buds
and
relied
on
feeling
alone
id
be
happy
sad
for
me
i
actually
do
a
dark
beer
with
a
massive
head
and
lacing
a
nice
nose
of
roasted
malts
that
is
light
on
chocolate
nice
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
milk
on
the
palate
high
carbonation
that
takes
away
from
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
bit
high
on
carbonation
so
some
of
the
flavors
are
gone
before
they
need
to
be
cheers
drinkability
sometimes
i
wish
i
was
back
in
north
carolina
just
so
i
can
taste
all
the
offerings
from
duckrabbit
guess
ill
just
have
to
visit
more
often
this
was
my
first
from
them
and
being
a
milk
stout
fan
i
can
see
why
theyve
been
garnering
great
reviews
big
ups
to
this
beer
and
the
people
behind
duckrabbit
poured
a
black
body
w
a
horribly
slow
receeding
mountainous
head
that
actually
ticked
me
off
a
little
a
large
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
with
roasted
malts
that
give
off
a
little
breadiness
and
there
are
hints
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
a
good
mix
of
malts
hit
the
tongue
as
roasted
malts
dominate
but
are
balanced
w
dark
chocolate
caramel
a
touch
of
biscuit
all
this
is
in
a
sticky
medium
body
with
some
sweetness
before
a
really
dry
backbite
envelopes
my
taste
buds
a
good
milk
stout
but
a
little
less
sweet
than
i
prefer
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
in
duck
rabbits
standard
lineup
d
very
easy
to
drink
had
this
at
10
oclock
in
the
morning
before
a
football
game
and
could
have
kept
drinking
these
all
day
deep
brown
color
with
a
creamy
cappuccinofoam
kind
of
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
mostly
light
and
clean
but
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
milkchocolate
some
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
what
seems
like
a
clean
mineral
character
the
flavor
has
much
of
the
same
nutty
chocolate
from
the
aroma
some
milk
sweetness
and
a
very
subtle
undercurrent
of
earthiness
that
keeps
this
one
from
getting
too
sweet
a
fine
carbonation
makes
the
texture
quite
silky
overall
this
beer
is
smooth
yet
flavorful
but
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
less
sweet
a
respectable
attempt
at
a
very
underappreciated
style
overall
i
just
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
bottle
was
drank
before
sept
but
maybe
something
was
wrong
with
it
the
flavors
just
didnt
match
up
really
well
not
something
i
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
mocha
and
briny
peaty
smokiness
medium
body
is
slightly
chewy
palate
is
dominated
by
roasted
malt
up
front
mellowing
into
a
marginally
malty
sweetness
typical
of
a
milk
stout
decent
and
sturdy
although
something
is
missing
for
this
to
be
a
great
beer
d
its
not
the
most
drinkable
stout
i
have
had
but
i
could
still
put
em
down
i
would
like
a
more
full
body
but
it
is
still
decent
overall
this
isnt
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
whats
done
is
done
very
well
an
easydrinking
and
flavorful
example
of
the
style
thats
worth
a
shot
d
very
nice
durability
overall
liked
the
flavors
and
moderate
abv
does
really
deserve
to
be
a
b
at
least
an
a
worthy
beer
love
it
drinkability
up
front
flavors
are
quite
nice
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
roasty
bitter
and
instills
regret
rather
than
fond
memories
perhaps
the
best
beer
of
my
recent
trip
to
georgetown
dc
this
is
a
stout
beer
drinkers
dream
really
has
a
snap
to
it
that
makes
it
better
than
other
microbrew
stouts
plus
the
price
of
this
beer
was
quite
reasonable
even
in
georgetown
only
six
dollars
for
a
pint
if
youve
ever
been
to
georgetown
youll
know
that
this
is
a
deal
drinkability
its
too
heavy
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
make
it
a
starter
beer
or
one
with
a
meal
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
dark
brown
almost
black
smells
like
a
creamy
cappucino
with
a
hint
of
licorice
tastes
much
better
than
it
looks
nice
mixture
of
bittersweet
a
bit
heavy
with
light
carbonation
cant
drink
more
than
a
few
a
bit
overpriced
in
my
opinion
although
i
love
this
brewery
overall
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
buy
it
per
beer
it
is
worth
a
try
if
only
by
six
pack
there
are
better
milk
stouts
for
the
price
d
cant
say
id
try
this
again
unless
i
could
get
it
on
tap
my
sister
loved
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
it
was
just
ok
a
nice
stout
from
a
bottle
with
a
very
simple
label
based
on
a
classic
optical
illusion
great
malt
flavors
off
the
bat
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
and
rich
brown
thick
head
with
excellent
retention
and
a
smell
that
draws
you
in
my
first
sip
was
very
creamy
with
a
nice
malt
character
a
very
nutty
beer
with
some
chocolate
notes
after
taste
is
a
little
bitter
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
enjoyability
of
this
fine
brew
this
is
one
beer
ill
be
grabbing
more
of
when
i
get
the
chance
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
as
expected
taste
was
ok
but
nothing
great
roasted
grains
mixed
with
a
nice
choco
reminder
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
on
both
tap
and
bottle
its
actually
on
of
my
top
five
goto
beers
tap
is
better
but
bottle
is
still
good
d
for
a
stout
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
strong
but
forgiving
flavor
changes
well
throughout
the
beer
keeps
things
interesting
great
beer
i
am
curious
if
its
a
little
thin
due
to
aging
or
if
this
is
how
the
beer
always
is
but
for
a
three
year
old
bottle
this
is
fantastic
this
is
a
decent
beer
bottle
from
chips
in
kill
devil
hills
nc
a
nearly
pitch
black
pour
hints
of
reddish
brown
come
through
the
edge
of
the
glass
when
held
to
a
light
minimal
fast
tan
head
nose
is
coffee
beans
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweet
toffee
in
the
back
beautiful
this
beer
tastes
great
very
flavorful
while
remaining
nonabrasive
in
any
aspect
it
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
piney
flavor
but
mostly
a
great
grainfounded
bitterness
that
is
well
met
with
a
smooth
texture
from
the
lactose
it
finishes
with
a
perfect
blend
of
sweet
and
roast
this
is
very
well
made
stout
buy
this
beer
missing
is
any
semblance
of
harshness
there
is
almost
no
alcohol
taste
its
all
very
pleasant
flavor
is
solid
but
mouthfeel
lacks
a
little
as
its
slightly
on
the
lighter
side
and
high
carbonation
the
flavors
are
milk
chocolate
chocolate
milk
toasted
malts
lightroasted
coffee
beans
and
really
no
booze
at
all
overall
another
decent
beer
in
the
duck
rabbit
lineup
d
amazingly
well
balanced
stout
between
sweet
and
malt
with
a
good
bite
that
makes
you
want
that
next
sweet
sip
i
could
drink
much
more
than
one
of
these
with
no
regrets
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
d
very
drinkable
good
amounts
of
mixing
of
all
the
flavors
very
nice
considering
its
a
nice
abv
notes
while
the
sweetness
was
not
cloying
this
is
still
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
good
d
really
drinkable
the
alcohol
taste
is
nonexistent
the
flavor
is
amazing
it
smells
wonderful
pretty
much
a
perfect
milk
stout
d
this
is
a
winner
great
mix
of
flavors
great
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
a
good
milk
stout
not
the
most
robust
but
definitely
holds
its
own
pick
some
up
if
you
see
this
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
very
very
good
mouthfeel
the
brew
doesnt
look
great
but
it
sure
does
taste
and
feel
like
a
great
brew
very
good
brew
from
the
duckrabbit
i
have
had
this
before
with
chocolate
cake
and
it
was
amazing
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
fairly
dark
tanned
head
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
fairly
clear
around
the
edges
with
a
lighter
brown
hue
not
much
head
retension
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
a
pleasant
roasty
character
of
dark
malt
similar
to
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
has
flavors
in
line
with
what
the
aroma
led
on
very
minimal
sweetness
which
is
what
i
like
with
this
style
opposed
to
the
overly
lactose
impregnated
messes
of
sweetness
that
distracts
from
the
other
flavors
somewhat
of
a
mineral
character
throughout
the
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
yeast
medium
to
light
feel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carb
overall
not
bad
the
flavor
and
sweetness
of
the
lactose
come
out
as
it
warms
and
also
are
more
noticable
in
the
aftertaste
d
goes
down
far
too
easily
very
tasty
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
evening
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
pretty
tasty
milk
stout
from
the
duckrabbit
craft
brewery
this
is
pretty
much
the
beer
that
got
my
friend
into
craft
beer
or
else
i
might
say
it
may
not
be
good
for
beginners
overall
a
great
beer
from
duck
rabbit
id
highly
recommend
it
i
just
didnt
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
it
was
ok
but
was
expecting
more
flavor
and
it
just
didnt
deliver
pours
black
not
terribly
thick
you
can
smell
the
spiciness
and
molasses
but
i
didnt
seem
to
taste
them
maybe
it
was
a
bad
night
for
my
taste
buds
but
this
beer
was
just
average
to
me
d
excellent
milk
stout
i
havent
ever
tasted
a
beer
with
this
type
of
creamy
whole
milklike
mouthfeel
before
this
is
my
second
duckrabbit
beer
their
baltic
porter
made
me
pay
attention
to
porters
again
and
this
milk
stout
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
complex
milk
stouts
i
believe
exist
on
the
market
at
least
at
the
8
a
sixpack
price
tag
on
a
grocery
store
shelf
pay
attention
to
these
guys
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
also
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
awhile
and
im
so
glad
i
got
to
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
are
defined
very
well
it
has
an
overall
good
flavor
d
this
beer
went
down
nicely
with
a
chocolate
cake
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
still
somewhat
rich
this
is
the
best
milksweet
stout
i
have
experienced
in
the
future
id
really
like
to
get
my
hands
on
more
duckrabbit
beer
d
very
good
i
can
barely
put
down
the
glass
i
wish
i
had
more
smooth
sweet
toasted
grain
its
light
but
has
great
flavor
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
had
them
drinkability
reminds
me
of
a
latte
i
had
in
paris
stouts
are
not
my
thing
but
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
great
before
dinner
beer
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
but
lacks
overall
flavor
overall
for
a
beer
this
sweet
the
quantity
of
roasted
malt
is
a
bit
high
for
my
preference
giving
it
a
little
more
coffee
flavor
relative
to
chocolate
flavor
even
still
it
is
a
wellmade
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
well
judging
by
how
smoothly
it
goes
down
and
how
little
i
have
left
at
the
end
of
the
review
i
can
say
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
delicious
flavor
and
flawless
mouthfeel
nice
roasted
flavor
without
the
bitterness
this
beer
is
so
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
aroma
is
chocolate
brown
sugar
roasted
malts
and
is
that
soap
i
would
like
less
carbonation
and
more
creaminess
there
is
definitely
a
sweetness
to
distinguish
this
from
traditional
american
stouts
but
not
enough
of
it
especially
in
the
finish
i
had
high
hopes
for
my
nonfest
first
sample
of
the
dark
beer
specialists
this
one
leaves
me
a
little
disappointed
d
a
well
crafted
brew
the
unfermentable
sugars
are
noticeable
and
make
this
milk
stout
quite
tasty
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
not
sure
what
im
looking
for
to
improve
maybe
lose
the
metallic
tinge
that
it
has
and
it
could
be
quite
good
the
flavor
is
big
coffee
and
cocoa
with
the
hops
showing
up
towards
the
beginning
of
the
profile
and
become
thinner
later
the
milkcrème
flavor
rides
the
tail
end
and
provides
sweetness
throughout
the
cocoa
chocolate
flavor
seems
to
be
on
the
bitter
side
which
isnt
bad
with
the
milk
flavor
to
balance
it
also
a
bit
of
stale
black
coffee
involved
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
of
r
a
stout
imo
but
this
is
a
session
able
and
tasty
brew
although
not
exceedingly
special
sweetness
is
a
little
too
high
to
keep
this
one
from
being
all
too
drinkable
though
its
quite
nice
and
a
couple
could
go
down
rather
effortlessly
the
overall
impression
is
reminiscent
of
a
coffeetinged
milkshake
a
nice
dessert
stout
or
even
a
decent
aperitif
but
not
really
a
session
beer
a
nice
stylistic
representation
though
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
way
to
finish
off
st
patricks
day
this
beer
was
hard
to
drink
at
first
i
like
the
sour
milk
and
sweetness
in
this
type
of
stout
but
this
one
is
too
colalike
the
carbonation
is
off
the
charts
i
would
still
give
it
another
chance
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
that
seems
to
be
the
case
with
some
duck
rabbit
beers
d
smooth
and
drinkable
with
solid
flavors
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
from
a
brewery
that
has
never
done
anything
to
impress
me
its
got
a
lot
of
the
ingredients
right
but
theres
just
something
missing
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
is
worth
trying
d
it
was
decent
im
not
in
love
with
it
id
have
it
again
d
i
like
this
milk
stout
a
lot
very
nice
cream
and
roasted
malts
taste
makes
this
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
high
carbonation
hurt
this
a
little
but
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
to
heavy
body
very
smoothand
a
little
sticky
one
thing
i
did
notice
is
the
carbonation
very
different
for
a
stout
the
beer
is
filling
but
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
though
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
tight
carbonation
which
made
it
harder
to
drink
but
gave
a
very
interesting
sensation
tickling
the
tongue
it
poured
deep
and
dark
with
a
nice
thick
head
wick
stuck
to
the
glass
most
of
the
way
the
smell
was
of
deep
roasted
malt
verry
strong
the
tase
was
a
little
sweet
but
not
to
bad
a
little
bitter
but
kind
of
smooth
not
to
much
very
drinkable
but
also
good
if
you
are
only
having
one
been
wanting
this
for
a
bit
kept
seeing
it
in
the
magazines
but
no
way
it
would
make
it
out
here
thanks
sincerenc
this
is
my
first
sweet
stout
so
i
have
really
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
guess
something
like
a
mirror
pond
but
much
sweeter
and
more
complex
great
beer
easy
to
drink
as
it
warms
it
gets
more
complex
very
drinkable
look
forward
to
the
rest
d
i
could
have
this
as
a
session
beer
with
ease
not
as
heavy
as
most
stouts
i
have
had
i
left
it
out
for
about
10
minutes
after
i
poured
it
and
had
it
at
about
55
degrees
wish
i
has
a
six
pack
dreally
easy
drinking
beer
although
it
would
have
been
a
great
beer
had
it
not
been
for
the
carbonation
issue
d
very
good
as
much
as
i
love
stouts
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
milk
stouts
this
one
however
is
pretty
damn
good
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
no
traces
of
the
alcohol
there
is
just
that
weird
flavor
that
im
not
digging
i
poured
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
the
the
color
was
a
brownamber
it
had
a
tan
two
finger
head
that
went
away
very
quickly
their
is
no
lacing
at
all
it
smells
of
malt
carmel
and
milklactose
it
tastes
roasted
and
malty
with
notes
of
carmel
there
is
a
small
aftertaste
of
malt
milk
and
light
hops
it
feels
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
average
for
the
stlye
large
two
finger
plus
head
of
very
fine
dark
tan
foam
whipped
up
appearance
with
a
good
deal
of
dimpling
as
it
dissolves
some
lacing
pure
black
in
color
faint
trace
of
yellowbrown
at
the
outer
edges
wellstuffed
nose
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
licorice
the
coffee
has
only
a
soft
roast
to
it
plum
cherry
and
a
liitle
bit
of
apricot
no
overt
hoppiness
however
the
breadiness
has
a
whole
grain
natural
roughness
to
it
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
with
a
wiry
woundup
carbonation
which
more
or
less
keeps
things
from
spreading
too
broadly
dry
cocoa
powder
malt
caramel
and
coffee
candy
vanilla
bean
it
offers
a
breadth
of
similar
flavors
without
excess
sweetness
not
roasty
at
times
perhaps
some
nuttiness
the
fruit
is
basic
cherry
blackberry
apricot
fig
not
too
dark
in
complexion
put
best
thusly
easy
to
drink
but
not
simple
pour
opaque
black
with
a
white
dissipating
head
black
malts
dominate
nose
assertive
roasted
barley
with
a
sweet
malt
licorice
aftertaste
no
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
makes
it
true
to
style
smooth
full
bodied
and
very
drinkable
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
enjoyed
this
sample
very
much
edit
011010
after
sampling
various
duckrabbit
offerings
over
the
past
couple
of
years
there
is
unfortunately
some
qualitycontrol
issues
with
this
brewery
its
a
shame
as
when
the
beers
are
good
theyre
really
good
ive
now
seen
the
porter
milk
stout
and
brown
ale
all
pour
10
liquid
90
head
they
also
have
a
tendency
to
go
sour
baltic
porter
included
although
nothing
like
i
saw
with
the
milk
stout
it
went
completely
sour
fresh
is
best
with
dr
and
even
then
there
is
no
guarantee
beer
is
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
the
nutty
flavor
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
is
also
present
as
well
as
a
slight
sweetness
probably
from
the
lactose
drinkability
is
ok
and
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
purposes
of
a
beer
like
this
this
wasnt
my
favorite
milk
stout
and
wouldnt
be
a
repeat
pretty
good
milk
stout
nice
pour
retains
lacing
a
little
less
of
the
coffeechocolaty
overtones
but
i
actually
like
this
so
this
is
a
plus
more
of
a
dark
fruit
with
slight
coffee
undertones
not
as
thick
as
other
milk
stouts
ive
tried
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
greatly
impressed
i
did
not
know
much
about
the
brewery
or
their
beers
coming
in
to
this
one
they
did
not
disappoint
i
look
forward
to
more
from
the
dark
beer
specialists
a
very
complex
milk
stout
with
a
high
final
gravity
no
doubt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
milk
stout
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
wonderful
stuff
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
i
tried
this
in
greensboro
nc
was
a
good
cream
stout
but
nothing
exceptional
not
as
dark
in
appearance
as
it
should
be
nothing
special
in
its
smell
but
this
tasted
good
and
went
down
nice
it
is
not
a
great
stout
but
it
is
good
and
is
worthy
to
be
drunk
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
to
have
too
many
of
these
one
is
probably
enough
a
very
nice
milk
stout
though
if
you
like
milk
stouts
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
nc
brew
havent
tried
too
much
else
from
duck
rabit
but
this
is
a
good
first
impression
deep
mahogany
body
that
looks
more
like
a
dark
brown
ale
around
the
edges
than
a
stout
no
foam
at
all
on
the
pour
but
a
faint
ring
of
larger
bubbles
gradually
collects
i
can
smell
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
as
the
beer
sits
on
the
table
in
front
of
me
lifting
it
to
my
nose
i
get
more
of
a
bourbon
and
peat
note
alcohol
malt
caramel
vanilla
and
smokiness
intertwined
the
initial
sip
is
a
bit
edgy
with
almost
a
sour
note
on
the
finish
subsequent
sips
reveal
more
peat
flavor
almost
like
a
wee
heavy
the
sweetness
gradually
builds
but
the
smoketinged
malt
remains
just
enough
bitterness
to
cleanse
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
heavy
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
is
more
of
a
nightcap
than
a
session
beer
in
my
book
would
drink
it
again
but
not
sure
it
cracks
my
current
30
or
so
beer
rotation
on
the
buy
a
case
list
drinkability
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
solid
stout
nice
roastiness
and
slightly
bitter
flavors
smell
is
a
little
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
but
beyond
those
criticisms
its
a
great
beer
and
i
would
have
no
problem
sipping
on
another
the
abv
is
also
very
doable
pretty
drinkable
a
tad
bit
thin
and
acidic
for
me
much
better
if
served
close
to
room
temp
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
to
have
this
one
but
i
certainly
like
other
milk
stouts
better
when
compared
to
say
moloko
plus
ill
take
the
moloko
hands
down
d
i
really
dont
know
why
milk
stouts
arent
more
sought
after
very
flavorful
easy
drinking
what
more
can
you
want
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
it
has
a
full
dark
tan
head
that
is
rocky
it
has
a
deep
opaque
body
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
the
body
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
adjunct
with
some
coffee
tones
it
has
a
rough
dark
cocoa
bitter
taste
that
is
not
too
roasty
very
smooth
to
drink
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
but
not
as
heavy
as
one
might
think
i
like
it
but
not
as
much
as
the
left
hand
milk
stout
that
i
actually
ordered
orderer
got
confused
so
i
took
this
keg
instead
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
on
a
medium
body
thats
not
too
big
but
just
full
enough
to
carry
the
full
flavors
in
this
beer
solid
carbonation
maybe
slightly
too
high
though
i
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
beer
as
an
excellent
milk
stout
example
12
ounce
bottle
best
by
december
2009
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
some
coffee
and
nuts
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
sweetness
from
the
lactose
shows
up
in
the
beer
well
it
tastes
like
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
also
a
smoky
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
seems
thin
for
a
stout
but
its
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
id
buy
it
again
in
the
future
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
solid
offering
from
duckrabbit
i
would
love
to
try
some
of
their
other
brews
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
introductory
brew
thanks
chris
for
the
chance
im
not
quite
sure
that
the
intense
burnt
roastiness
of
this
worked
as
well
with
this
style
as
it
does
with
some
of
the
other
beers
from
these
guys
as
i
like
my
milk
stouts
a
little
more
creamy
and
sweet
not
bad
at
all
but
ill
stick
to
some
of
the
other
duck
rabbit
offerings
out
there
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
this
before
i
love
all
the
beers
from
duck
rabbit
and
this
is
a
staple
in
my
home
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
could
sit
down
with
all
night
would
make
a
great
23
beer
start
moving
to
your
usual
drink
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
like
this
milk
stout
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
nice
and
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
however
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
opaque
pretty
much
black
with

slowly
leaving
behind

some

faint

in
the

decent
texture
a
nice
drinkable
beer
d
good
this
is
my
first
milk
stout
it
didnt
really
disappoint
just
need
to
get
my
palate
used
to
the
extreme
roasted
flavors
but
it
was
enjoyable
overall
id
have
another
this
is
my
first
dive
into
anything
from
duckrabbit
but
im
going
to
keep
a
look
out
next
time
im
in
some
markets
where
its
available
good
stuff
this
is
an
interesting
beer
im
an
ipa
guy
but
im
becoming
a
bigger
and
bigger
fan
of
duck
rabbit
maybe
not
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
but
it
drinks
pretty
well
solid
nice
beer
just
not
very
complex
d
not
very
good
really
hope
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
on
this
one
ive
enjoyed
the
other
duck
rabbit
brews
ive
had
this
one
let
me
down
d
decent
but
the
creaminess
hurts
this
category
a
bit
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
overall
but
not
a
standout
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
improved
with
time
as
the
intensely
carbonated
head
withered
away
perhaps
with
such
a
volatile
pour
some
settling
time
should
be
exercised
to
appreciate
the
depths
of
the
beer
md
a
little
bit
watery
in
texture
for
a
milk
stout
the
high
carbonation
that
made
this
so
hard
to
pour
disappears
as
soon
as
the
beer
is
in
the
glass
this
is
a
light
and
easy
drinking
stout
while
not
something
i
would
turn
to
on
a
cold
day
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
around
if
you
want
a
stout
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
drinkability
i
am
very
glad
duck
rabbit
has
made
it
to
pa
this
is
a
well
balanced
smooth
easy
to
drink
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
drinkability
great
stout
and
i
would
recommend
it
d
this
was
the
perfect
topper
to
a
long
day
working
on
my
truck
the
flavor
was
awesome
a
little
more
in
the
headlacing
department
and
this
would
be
even
better
definitely
a
new
main
stay
in
my
fridge
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
a
solid
offering
but
i
think
lancasters
milk
stout
is
a
bit
better
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
flavor
is
smooth
with
sweet
malted
tones
and
a
slight
roasted
edge
on
it
a
slight
tang
on
there
as
well
that
seems
almost
fruit
like
very
smooth
a
bit
too
tangy
though
at
times
it
seems
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
lower
carbonation
nice
to
drink
might
be
a
bit
too
far
on
the
tangy
side
for
some
people
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
august
this
is
pretty
lightbodied
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
but
id
predict
the
sweetness
would
get
a
little
tiresome
rather
than
balance
it
out
with
hops
bitterness
the
approach
seems
to
be
to
make
it
thin
enough
that
it
kind
of
washes
itself
away
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
nice
version
of
the
style
that
is
goes
down
nicely
this
was
nice
a
fresh
on
tap
definitely
could
have
drank
a
few
more
wish
i
hadnt
bought
just
one
overall
props
to
the
duckrabbit
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
of
their
brews
however
the
regular
milk
stout
is
much
more
tasty
smokey
nose
not
as
sweet
as
the
bb
style
the
beer
fuzes
nicely
with
the
malts
of
the
stout
and
creates
a
greater
drinkability
taste
is
roast
malt
cocoa
lactic
malted
milk
ball
finishes
with
a
bit
of
that
malted
milk
ball
and
coffee
strong
medium
bodied
drinkable
stout
this
and
the
left
hand
milk
stout
are
kind
of
the
two
barometers
i
would
use
for
milk
stouts
others
better
and
others
worse
but
this
is
well
worth
trying
drinkability
wow
exactly
what
i
wanted
right
now
a
smooth
yet
flavorful
nearsession
ale
that
is
extremely
satisfying
when
will
distro
spread
to
ohio
thanks
again
jon
your
generosity
will
not
be
forgotten
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
nutty
cholcolately
mild
coffee
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
from
the
lactose
not
as
rich
and
creamy
as
some
other
milk
stouts
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
not
too
complex
but
good
at
what
it
does
i
might
pick
this
as
a
nice
session
brew
d
mild
flavor
and
thinner
body
i
guess
make
this
an
easy
drinker
this
is
an
all
around
nice
beer
but
not
outstanding
and
it
goes
down
smooth
all
seasons
milk
stout
for
me
edit
tried
this
101510
again
with
an
1110
bbd
and
everything
is
spot
on
except
theres
no
acidity
that
was
noted
above
thick
and
richly
delicious
and
pleasantly
bitter
d
a
very
fine
milk
stoutquite
tasty
for
the
style
and
rich
w
plenty
of
sweetness
i
wouldnt
say
sessionable
really
at
5
7
buta
quaffable
quality
is
how
i
would
describe
it
the
stout
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
the
numbers
in
this
review
not
only
reflect
the
beer
but
also
how
the
appear
to
run
their
bottling
shipping
and
distribution
easy
to
quaff
md
medium
bodied
a
little
on
the
full
side
compared
to
alot
of
milk
stouts
out
there
carboantion
is
a
touch
high
very
easy
drinking
basically
the
same
i
had
this
laying
around
and
finally
opened
it
up
beside
the
2009
the
flavor
seemed
to
decrease
and
it
lost
alot
of
the
carbonation
compared
to
the
2009
i
definitely
preferred
it
fresh
appears
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
with
a
minimal
tan
head
forming
scant
lacing
as
it
dwindles
aroma
has
some
roasted
malts
with
a
creamy
lactose
mineral
character
caramel
and
toffee
edges
flavor
has
a
creamy
milk
chocolate
with
watered
down
coffee
accents
and
minimal
herbal
hops
seems
very
porterish
but
has
a
super
swet
sugary
note
maybe
from
the
addition
of
lactose
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
not
as
heavy
or
full
of
girth
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
went
in
reverse
trying
duck
rabbit
beers
i
had
the
baltic
porter
and
barleywine
first
and
and
just
now
im
trying
the
milk
stout
carbonation
was
soft
and
even
pretty
tame
in
a
matter
of
fact
drinkability
overall
was
quality
and
i
will
standby
their
claim
of
being
the
dark
beer
specialist
of
the
south
heres
to
beer
in
the
south
i
hope
wv
kicks
it
up
a
notch
with
the
alcohol
law
change
this
is
a
surpisingly
good
stout
considering
this
is
not
one
of
the
major
brewing
areas
of
the
country
i
believe
many
of
these
lesser
know
brew
companies
may
hold
unknown
great
beers
for
a
milk
stout
there
may
be
others
with
slightly
more
flavor
a
little
more
alcohol
or
a
level
more
of
thickness
but
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
overall
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
d
a
very
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
here
very
tasty
and
quite
sessionable
fresh
12oz
bottle
pours
dark
brownblack
with
contrary
to
a
lot
of
other
recent
reviews
a
billowing
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
sheet
lacing
aromas
of
toffee
and
chocolate
milk
nice
dark
roasted
malt
character
tastes
of
light
milk
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
coffee
dark
and
creamy
overall
pretty
nice
creamy
body
a
sipper
for
sure
but
quite
pleasant
an
easy
going
but
somewhat
disappointing
milk
stout
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
something
anything
a
solid
beer
good
taste
but
watery
and
not
very
visually
appealing
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definately
get
more
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
little
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
although
not
as
much
as
i
expected
the
taste
started
off
with
some
semisweet
chocolate
that
gave
way
to
a
bit
of
toasted
coffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
rich
with
a
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
stout
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
while
i
was
in
north
carolina
while
nothing
earth
shattering
i
thought
this
a
very
nice
uncomplicated
easy
to
enjoy
stout
d
certainly
a
drinkable
stout
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
this
one
when
theres
samuel
adams
cream
stout
out
there
which
for
me
tastes
and
smells
much
more
inviting
d
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
overall
very
delicious
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
creamy
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
sweet
coffee
like
finish
the
flavor
lingers
but
the
overall
aftertaste
is
weaker
than
i
expected
however
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
with
a
great
overall
flavor
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
having
another
but
could
use
a
few
improvements
some
smooth
coffee
notes
at
the
start
followed
by
some
milky
smoothness
but
not
as
milky
as
i
expected
smooth
medium
bodied
well
balanced
d
very
drinkable
a
very
light
stout
but
with
considerable
stout
flavor
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
still
a
phenomenal
tasting
beer
pours
a
great
black
color
with
awesome
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
excellent
scent
a
great
burnt
graincoffee
combination
with
a
wonderful
sweet
lacing
from
the
milk
sugars
awesome
taste
a
great
stout
flavor
with
some
nice
coffeecocoa
tones
and
a
wonderful
sweet
milk
flavor
to
smooth
it
out
with
just
the
tiniest
of
hop
bites
to
keep
it
from
being
unbalanced
a
wonderful
beer
d
low
abv
works
for
me
the
taste
does
not
so
i
wont
be
going
back
for
this
one
perhaps
this
was
a
off
batch
either
way
not
a
good
look
in
my
book
overall
not
a
bad
milk
stout
but
not
great
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
look
forward
to
the
other
stuff
duck
rabbit
has
to
offer
sadly
i
find
this
to
be
a
complete
and
utter
dud
this
was
very
nearly
a
drainpour
once
again
i
am
reviewing
this
knowing
that
there
is
something
not
right
with
this
batch
carbonation
for
the
umpteenth
time
however
its
not
limited
to
just
a
single
or
even
a
couple
of
bottles
but
clearly
is
pretty
widespread
given
other
reviews
ive
read
unfortunately
im
not
going
to
come
back
to
this
beer
at
least
not
in
bottles
for
some
time
until
i
have
some
confidence
that
maybe
duck
rabbit
has
thoroughly
fixed
its
qc
problem
this
brew
has
a
very
dark
apperance
with
crimson
hues
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
mucho
lace
average
head
the
main
smell
is
the
alchol
but
also
coffe
and
burntness
full
bodied
chococoffe
taste
and
is
somewhat
creamy
as
well
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
and
somewhat
creamy
hence
the
milk
tingles
the
back
of
the
mouth
went
down
fast
and
smooth
i
could
drink
this
till
the
sun
came
up
im
a
rookie
with
stouts
and
this
was
a
great
beer
to
try
outside
the
guiness
box
a
great
one
to
get
if
you
are
in
a
dark
beer
kinda
mood
tastes
more
firm
and
lively
than
it
smells
smooth
coffee
up
front
moving
into
an
excessively
silky
middle
of
chocolate
and
bittersour
grain
ending
on
a
maltodextrinous
bitterness
of
light
stout
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
carbonation
levels
are
low
easy
drinking
and
delicious
d
exceedingly
drinkable
with
low
carbonaiton
and
a
lightthanmedium
body
makes
afor
a
mighty
drinkable
brew
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
uneven
the
lack
of
head
made
me
wonder
about
packaging
issues
although
the
flavor
was
excellent
this
beer
is
great
a
very
well
crafted
milk
stout
good
not
extraordinary
i
have
a
second
bottle
of
this
because
i
bought
a
few
of
each
duck
rabbit
bottles
since
we
just
got
them
here
if
this
was
a
bad
bottle
i
will
rereview
if
not
my
second
will
be
my
last
d
not
something
i
would
reach
for
everyday
but
i
imagine
this
one
to
pair
quite
well
with
burgers
or
steaks
right
off
the
grill
bacon
cheeseburger
would
be
perfect
now
that
i
think
about
it
this
is
tasty
but
not
exceptional
and
personally
not
enough
body
to
satisfy
the
need
for
a
stout
but
makes
a
great
porter
this
is
my
first
offering
from
duck
rabbit
and
ill
be
sure
to
seek
it
out
if
the
make
it
to
nj
fingers
crossed
d
a
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
a
good
milk
stout
one
of
the
top
3
milk
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
would
def
like
a
sixer
of
these
to
relax
and
watch
a
game
t
m
d
flavour
is
very
much
like
the
nose
though
body
is
a
lot
lighter
than
what
i
may
have
expected
perhaps
i
was
expecting
something
smoother
and
went
into
it
with
unreasonable
expectations
but
it
does
seem
to
be
lacking
as
it
flows
over
the
palate
the
flavour
and
the
aroma
are
just
fine
but
it
almost
begs
for
a
little
more
size
but
thats
just
me
if
it
is
their
most
popular
offering
i
imagine
most
people
think
its
just
fine
a
nice
flavourful
beer
without
a
huge
alcohol
content
not
exactly
a
sessionable
offering
but
i
could
go
with
a
couple
on
a
more
relaxed
evening
drinkability
i
think
this
is
ok
for
a
milk
stout
the
sweetness
i
found
was
more
subtle
that
others
i
would
have
another
but
almost
would
drink
it
more
like
a
regular
stout
d
a
wonderfully
sessionable
milkstout
lack
of
head
was
my
biggest
disappointment
but
i
was
impressed
in
all
other
facets
a
wonderful
introduction
to
duckrabbit
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light
but
crisp
carbonation
mfd
very
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
not
dry
at
all
smooth
going
down
medium
in
body
anyways
if
you
are
in
north
carolina
you
should
definitely
pick
up
a
6
pack
on
the
thin
bodied
side
but
not
too
much
so
everything
here
works
pretty
well
low
enough
abv
where
you
could
have
a
few
and
not
be
under
the
table
more
than
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
happy
and
interested
many
examples
of
milk
stouts
ive
sampled
in
the
past
tend
to
be
a
bit
to
sugary
a
bit
too
much
vanilla
too
sweet
more
on
the
lactic
side
duck
rabbits
brew
incorporates
it
into
a
bitter
jahva
like
brew
with
a
creamy
quality
well
balanced
well
done
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
pours
brownish
black
with
a
gigantic
rocky
head
aroma
is
not
unlike
a
english
stout
aroma
is
slightly
lactic
sour
milk
some
roast
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
a
nice
cream
feel
with
some
good
unexpected
carbonation
flavors
are
chocolate
roast
and
smoke
the
lactose
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
expected
good
thing
and
brings
a
nice
balance
to
the
brew
this
is
a
solid
milk
stout
highly
drinkable
and
recommended
taste
is
full
of
creamy
roasted
chocolate
but
also
has
some
dark
fruit
and
chalky
notes
a
well
balanced
milk
stout
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
the
slight
astringency
is
a
minor
drawback
but
otherwise
a
complex
milk
stout
with
alot
of
character
pours
a
dark
almost
black
in
color
smell
is
smokey
and
lactic
it
has
a
very
distinct
burnt
note
in
the
smell
taste
is
very
nice
the
lacticmilk
notes
are
well
done
and
taste
good
a
tad
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
a
decent
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
without
getting
slammed
by
the
abv
another
solid
beer
from
dr
to
this
date
there
has
been
only
one
beer
from
them
that
has
not
impressed
me
i
dig
but
not
for
everyone
much
like
the
burger
king
rodeo
burger
a
letdown
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
this
beer
fits
to
style
for
the
most
part
except
its
a
bit
thinner
than
i
wouldve
expected
pours
out
brown
with
darkness
concentrated
in
the
middle
of
everything
or
maybe
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
some
lighter
highlights
by
any
means
no
black
a
small
1cm
head
rises
then
disappears
very
quickly
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
at
first
is
pure
carbonation
but
then
you
catch
a
bit
of
sweetness
mixed
in
with
a
tiny
bit
of
an
estery
smell
if
you
try
you
can
smell
a
bit
of
the
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
quite
like
the
smell
you
get
a
mouthful
of
sweetness
which
is
kept
in
check
by
esters
theres
a
tiny
taste
of
chocolate
malt
and
very
little
presence
of
roasted
barley
i
my
opinion
the
roasted
barley
would
serve
as
a
better
balancer
than
the
estery
taste
but
ive
found
a
few
of
these
beers
to
be
a
bit
more
estery
than
expected
but
this
one
still
tastes
nice
theres
even
a
tiny
taste
of
dryness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rich
with
decent
complexity
and
nice
carbonation
even
without
any
head
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
an
everyday
beer
a
decent
attempt
and
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
first
go
at
a
homebrewed
milk
stout
with
room
for
improvement
good
beer
i
was
reluctant
toi
try
this
one
because
i
hate
milk
however
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
and
good
to
try
another
north
carolina
brew
if
you
see
this
in
stores
its
worth
a
try
if
you
dont
like
stouts
you
may
still
like
this
one
so
give
it
a
try
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
stout
not
quite
as
sweet
or
smooth
as
some
great
milk
stouts
but
good
no
the
less
and
worth
a
try
d
overall
a
nice
drinking
stout
enjoyable
and
had
enough
things
going
on
with
it
to
keep
me
interested
from
beginning
to
end
a
nice
milk
stout
rather
unique
in
it
flavor
component
but
drinkable
i
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
milk
stout
even
with
the
odd
flavor
this
is
still
rather
drinkable
it
doesnt
taste
like
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
beer
just
a
weird
flavor
other
than
that
a
decent
milk
stout
this
is
a
relatively
lightbodied
stout
sweet
and
deliciously
smooth
this
beer
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
i
was
hoping
that
this
milk
stout
would
showcase
sweet
lactose
notes
and
a
rich
creaminess
but
that
was
not
the
case
this
might
be
a
decent
american
stout
but
it
definitely
does
not
fit
the
bill
for
the
style
meh
i
wasnt
quite
as
impressed
as
id
hoped
with
this
one
i
love
a
good
milk
stout
but
this
one
doesnt
quite
fit
the
bill
aroma
is
awesome
but
taste
is
just
a
touch
muddled
and
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
sing
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
cant
say
ill
be
attempting
to
track
down
any
more
of
this
one
smooth
dark
malt
taste
that
warms
into
boring
cola
not
as
soursweet
as
most
milk
stouts
good
use
of
lively
carbonation
to
balance
dense
body

d
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
ive
tasted
the
duckrabbit
carries
a
pleasant
balance
between
the
lactose
and
darker
malt
components
i
typically
dont
make
a
session
out
of
stouts
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
on
the
whole
a
decent
beer
that
is
certainly
drinkable
but
not
spectacular
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
definitely
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
it
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
color
with
white
lacing
the
smell
was
absolutely
phenomenal
a
sugary
sweet
milk
chocolate
aroma
perfect
for
a
milk
stout
the
taste
that
followed
was
smooth
and
delicious
not
too
cloying
but
definitely
a
chocolate
maltball
sweetness
the
lactose
is
definitely
present
and
a
roasted
chocolatey
note
follows
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
craving
more
a
great
milk
stout
and
a
great
session
beer
d
a
very
nice
milk
stout
it
has
an
excellent
milk
chocolate
character
and
is
dry
enough
to
avoid
becoming
cloying
in
the
way
that
some
other
sweet
stouts
can
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
easily
impressed
by
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
d
this
didnt
exactly
strike
me
as
a
milk
stout
but
rather
it
drank
more
like
a
coffee
stout
with
plenty
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
bitterness
with
that
said
it
is
still
quite
a
good
stout
overall
pretty
disappointed
up
till
now
i
have
been
a
big
fan
of
milk
stouts
i
guess
i
have
just
been
lucky
in
the
ones
i
have
drank
so
far
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
the
brew
may
be
kind
of
thin
but
at
least
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
pretty
good
overall
very
average
beer
that
had
a
funky
taste
of
spoiled
milk
curds
and
baby
cribs
it
tasted
like
a
shot
of
milk
was
poured
in
a
glass
of
cocacola
and
then
infumigated
with
breast
milk
how
do
i
describe
this
other
than
ick
just
an
average
beer
how
it
got
a
3
8
rating
ill
never
know
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
i
would
enjoy
it
again
given
the
opportunity
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
very
light
bodied
for
a
stout
not
very
interesting
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
d
this
brew
has
a
nice
flavor
and
is
quite
drinkable
its
my
first
duckrabbit
beer
and
ill
definitely
seek
out
others
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
though
as
its
just
a
little
bit
odd
tasting
for
a
milk
stout
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
well
creamy
this
is
a
beer
i
could
sip
all
day
drinkability
is
good
abv
low
enough
to
make
it
session
beer
in
my
book
very
nice
this
milk
stout
has
a
nice
composed
feel
to
it
as
the
ingredients
all
blend
well
and
yield
a
nice
smooth
beer
d
meh
its
nothing
unique
but
a
good
brew
id
like
it
better
if
it
didnt
stick
around
on
the
tongue
and
palate
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
stout
admittedly
im
not
crazy
about
milk
stouts
but
i
know
when
im
drinking
a
well
crafted
beer
regardless
of
style
dthis
is
a
good
milk
stout
wish
i
could
get
it
in
my
area
but
i
will
say
this
any
time
a
make
a
trip
to
nc
i
will
be
picking
up
this
brew
and
id
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
drinkability
i
did
not
finish
it
and
wont
be
purchasing
this
again
this
beer
on
cask
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
d
very
good
stout
balance
and
compexity
make
it
an
interesting
and
easy
drink
ran
across
this
in
hendersonville
nc
while
visiting
a
friend
and
picked
up
a
six
pack
must
say
i
was
overjoyed
with
the
results
and
drank
the
entire
thing
in
one
sitting
hangovers
aside
i
keep
coming
back
for
more
bold
and
chocolatey
pours
with
a
huge
head
creating
brotherly
warm
feeling
a
classic
for
lovers
of
the
dark
stuff
must
say
though
that
it
tastes
a
little
sour
on
draft
although
ive
only
had
this
once
and
oddly
enough
im
finding
myself
switching
to
the
duck
rabbit
porter
as
it
seems
to
be
more
drinkable
less
sour
in
the
long
run
still
the
milk
stout
is
a
classic
and
highly
recommended
tasty
stout
from
duck
rabbit
the
dark
beer
specialists
drinks
easy
tastes
great
an
enjoyable
experience
it
pour
dark
and
black
as
it
should
with
a
large
golden
color
head
that
quickly
depletes
there
are
many
smells
including
coffee
and
molasses
the
flavor
a
sweet
start
and
mellows
out
to
milky
goodness
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
but
it
almost
feels
like
there
is
something
miss
or
something
im
missing
d
i
think
carbonation
would
really
make
the
drinkability
go
up
a
bit
i
have
had
much
more
drinkable
examples
in
the
style
pour
a
pitch
black
body
with
a
tall
tan
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
show
less
lactose
than
youd
expect
from
a
milksweet
stout
so
this
beer
comes
off
with
big
roasted
and
burnt
malts
accompanied
by
the
candyvand
frostinglike
sweetness
of
the
lactose
this
is
a
good
milksweet
stout
to
try
if
you
think
mackesons
is
too
sweet
on
the
other
hand
i
think
the
lactose
masks
too
much
of
the
malt
without
providing
more
flavor
thanks
to
unionturf
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
best
by
0808
notched
on
the
label
poured
the
color
of
cola
opaque
and
almost
black
with
a
four
inch
tancolored
head
the
sizzled
and
popped
as
it
slowly
collapsed
head
eventually
settled
into
a
solid
cap
with
copious
bands
of
lacing
left
behind
as
the
brew
was
consumed
nose
is
very
subdued
a
roasted
character
and
bakers
chocolate
as
well
as
a
tangy
fruitiness
in
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
more
tangy
dark
fruit
at
the
finish
lacks
the
lactose
quality
characteristic
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
not
really
consistent
with
the
style
a
little
too
light
in
texture
and
too
much
effervescence
good
drinkability
but
characteristics
across
the
board
are
not
consistent
with
a
milk
stout
this
is
well
balanced
and
very
sessionable
thans
to
unionturf
for
the
sample
you
know
what
i
mean
coffiee
mollassas
and
a
burnt
malt
flavor
this
one
is
great
every
time
i
go
to
north
carolina
i
pick
up
a
few
6ers
to
take
home
nice
and
dark
a
tuch
thick
and
a
all
around
sweet
milk
stout
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
season
but
it
is
fall
like
temps
hear
in
new
your
today
so
i
figured
i
would
break
one
out
good
choise
pours
a
deep
amber
black
with
a
small
beige
head
aroma
is
medium
sweet
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
almond
flavor
is
sweet
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
covered
cherries
medium
to
large
body
creamy
texture
finishes
dry
and
chocolate
sweet
this
was
stored
pretty
well
so
i
dont
believe
there
can
be
too
much
of
a
problem
with
it
due
to
poor
storage
conditions
drinkability
good
another
winner
from
duck
rabbit
fast
becoming
one
of
the
better
breweries
in
the
south
a
style
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
so
it
should
perhaps
rate
even
higher
than
this
but
still
some
serious
carbonation
going
on
here
i
can
feel
my
teeth
beginning
to
ache
already
even
a
gentle
swirl
brings
some
serious
snapcracklepop
out
of
the
surly
pint
glass
i
wish
duck
rabbit
distributed
to
new
jersey
i
love
the
d
this
beer
is
smooth
and
rich
yet
simple
which
makes
a
nice
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
d
ok
i
could
go
on
all
day
but
would
gain
15
lbs
if
i
keep
downing
these
dont
get
me
wrong
i
could
do
it
with
this
delicious
brew
drinkability
very
nice
beer
another
hit
from
duck
rabbit
thanks
to
everetends
for
the
bottle
pours
dark
brown
out
of
the
bottle
that
looks
almost
completely
black
in
the
glass
the
head
is
fairly
thick
and
dissipates
slowly
to
a
ring
with
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
big
on
sweet
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
oatmeal
in
the
background
there
is
also
a
significant
milk
chocolate
aroma
as
well
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
dominating
the
taste
its
like
liquid
malted
milk
balls
and
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
very
creamy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
and
its
one
of
the
better
sweet
stouts
ive
had
recently
highly
recommended
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
nice
first
a
rich
roasted
malt
a
little
chocolate
and
i
can
imagine
over
cooked
milk
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
there
is
a
substantial
roasted
grainy
expresso
aftertexture
full
flavored
the
roasted
taste
of
coffee
dominates
but
you
can
again
imagine
burnt
milk
because
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
its
not
all
coffee
a
real
nice
drinker
im
usually
put
off
by
a
super
roasted
character
this
one
is
all
bark
the
5
7
abv
makes
this
one
quite
sessionable
light
stout
feel
and
easy
to
drink
not
quite
the
milk
stout
like
mackesons
but
more
coffee
dthis
is
a
pretty
good
stout
i
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
d
i
certainly
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
its
good
but
its
also
a
little
strange
and
the
sourness
is
not
something
i
was
expecting
nor
something
i
think
is
appropriate
with
licorice
or
whatever
it
is
im
tasting
something
about
this
brew
was
just
a
little
too
weird
for
me
to
completely
enjoy
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown

insanely
smooth
very
nice
stout
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
thanks
dan
a
highly
quaffable
sweet
stout
thanks
to
shivtim
for
this
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
reddish
hue
puffy
offwhite
head
falls
off
fast
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
some
chocolate
for
good
measure
deep
almost
fruity
chocolate
flavor
quite
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
some
roasted
malt
flavor
as
well
tastes
better
as
it
warms
pretty
full
bodied
nice
not
quite
as
good
as
some
other
milk
stouts
but
well
made
nonetheless
opaque
pretty
much
black
with
faint
mahogany
edges
generous
foam
off
the
pour
the
fluffy
tan
cap
settled
slowly
leaving
behind
a
few
clumpy
chunks
of
lace
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
roast
faint
cherry
same
in
the
flavour
mild
bitterness
even
from
the
dark
malts
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
filled
out
the
flavour
lingering
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
decent
texture
a
nice
drinkable
beer
drinkability
one
was
enough
i
dont
know
alot
of
other
milk
stout
examples
but
this
is
nice
since
it
isnt
too
full
more
of
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
since
theres
plenty
of
flavorful
and
the
abv
isnt
fatal
i
would
recommend
this
to
others
to
try
and
look
forward
to
having
another
if
i
get
the
chance
taste
when
cold
the
stout
has
a
smooth
taste
and
you
can
really
enjoy
the
flavor
but
once
it
gets
warm
it
loses
some
smoothness
it
would
be
great
for
a
black
tan
smooth
and
milky
in
the
mouth
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
keeps
the
beer
light
and
drinkable
i
had
this
on
tap
at
tylers
tap
room
in
durham
the
beer
was
dark
brown
opaque
in
the
center
with
faint
red
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
thin
but
creamy
tan
foam
the
aroma
was
great
some
coffee
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
nice
chocolate
component
the
taste
is
also
nice
hitting
the
flavors
described
above
and
adding
an
almost
sugary
but
not
cloying
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
coating
and
drinkability
was
no
problem
the
exceptional
flavors
made
this
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
almost
black
aroma
is
rich
smoky
and
coffeeish
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
is
wellrounded
smoky
with
strong
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
components
i
recommend
this
very
drinkable
stout
to
all
fans
of
dark
beers
pours
near
black
a
big
tan
head
comes
up
and
stays
for
the
majority
of
the
session
ending
in
a
thin
ring
before
the
last
couple
sips
smell
is
rich
and
bold
for
a
smaller
beer
such
as
this
creamy
chocolate
dark
bitter
chocolate
under
it
a
little
roast
also
this
smell
that
i
notice
in
all
of
drs
dark
beers
its
like
brewers
licorice
or
something
very
apparent
in
the
rabid
duck
and
even
in
the
baltic
porter
its
here
too
taste
is
great
its
pretty
sweet
up
front
lots
of
chocolate
and
cream
dark
chocolate
comes
in
again
some
dark
fruits
also
add
depth
an
excellent
hop
presence
enters
in
the
finish
making
it
creamy
yet
slightly
dry
at
times
quite
the
drinkable
brew
for
the
style
i
dont
come
across
many
that
i
could
enjoy
multiple
pints
of
when
it
comes
to
a
sweet
stout
but
this
is
surely
one
of
the
few
great
stuff
highly
recommended
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
and
silky
smooth
awesome
drinkability
enough
complexity
and
flavor
to
keep
you
wanting
more
but
not
too
big
of
a
beer
to
weigh
you
down
a
top
milk
stout
in
my
book
this
is
a
solid
brown
color
with
thin
light
brown
head
and
good
lace
it
brings
on
a
deep
raisin
and
oak
aroma
with
also
some
brown
bread
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
tart
and
grapelike
with
some
molasses
and
a
touch
of
charcoal
its
drinkable
but
a
bit
sharp
medium
bodied
a
good
quality
stout
d
i
can
drink
this
i
am
a
big
fan
of
stouts
the
taste
is
amazing
to
make
up
for
the
smell
i
got
off
this
beer
i
might
have
just
opened
an
off
bottle
will
drink
again
d
an
excellent
milk
stout
that
i
could
drink
more
of
pours
opaquely
black
with
a
rocky
light
brown
head
nice
dark
roasty
character
with
some
residual
sweetness
coming
through
some
light
grassiness
and
caramel
notes
the
hops
seem
to
cut
any
richness
or
overly
sweet
sensation
that
milk
stouts
tend
to
have
mouthfeel
is
rich
yet
amply
carbonated
id
certainly
try
this
one
again
d
easily
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
before
having
my
fill
lower
abv
also
helps
a
lot
this
is
my
favorite
from
duck
rabbit
so
far
and
my
favorite
milk
stout
albeit
i
havent
had
tons
get
this
one
if
you
can
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
strong
chocolate
taste
mild
bitterness
and
mild
coffeeish
presence
thanks
wcudwight
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
drinkable
and
something
i
plan
on
picking
up
again
overall
pretty
drinkable
everything
ive
had
from
duckrabbit
has
been
solid
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
as
to
be
expected
a
bit
tannic
a
sipper
very
drinkable
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
passing
this
one
on
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
tan
head
it
smelled
like
spoiled
milk
and
licorice
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
berries
theres
a
chance
this
was
skunked
but
i
think
this
is
just
the
nature
of
a
milk
stout
versus
a
standard
stout
my
first
impression
was
that
it
tasted
like
ragweed
it
had
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
flavor
no
coffee
and
some
slight
hops
in
the
aftertaste
it
had
good
carbonation
but
it
was
still
watery
and
thin
for
a
stout
overall
this
was
a
strange
tasting
beer
and
a
unique
stout
d
easy
drinking
good
tasting
brew
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
very
smooth
light
body
the
carbonation
is
low
but
appropriate
this
was
a
very
satisfying
milk
stout
and
almost
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
nicely
played
duck
rabbit
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
i
feel
like
this
represents
a
milk
stout
well
i
really
want
to
like
duck
rabbit
but
i
have
yet
to
find
one
of
their
beers
i
am
more
than
lukewarm
toward
pours
a
dark
black
but
is
dark
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
a
thick
1
mocha
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
heavy
lacing
smells
of
malt
with
sweet
chocolate
and
cream
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
milk
with
a
slight
bitterness
it
seems
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
there
needs
to
be
more
balance
with
some
smoke
flavors
to
make
it
better
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
it
slides
down
easily
overall
i
could
drink
a
few
more
in
one
sitting
not
bad
for
a
milk
stout
but
a
little
too
sweet
thanks
to
drbayern
for
this
one
deep
dark
brownblack
pour
with
a
big
lasting
puffy
tan
head
on
it
sweet
creamy
milky
roasted
malt
smell
to
it
almost
milk
chocolate
like
taste
was
roasty
less
sweet
than
expected
with
a
nice
light
roasty
bitterness
to
it
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
ideal
in
my
bottle
especially
for
a
stout
but
i
see
the
last
couple
raters
didnt
have
the
same
experience
id
prefer
a
touch
less
carbonation
and
a
tad
more
sweetness
however
it
is
still
a
fine
milk
stout
and
one
worth
trying
d
enjoyable
brew
but
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
have
a
lot
of
this
is
a
unique
and
satisfying
beer
it
had
a
deep
rubyblack
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapated
quickly
but
left
a
good
deal
of
lacing
it
smelled
of
rich
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
ice
cream
the
taste
was
excellent
a
very
rich
and
decadent
mix
of
malt
and
the
yogurt
like
soursweetness
from
the
lactose
very
well
made
beautiful
color
on
this
beer
nearly
opaque
black
to
my
eyes
beautiful
headif
thinthat
drops
out
quickly
flavor
and
smell
were
lux
what
im
looking
for
in
a
milk
stout
coffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
overall
i
thought
this
is
a
very
good
milk
stout
this
is
the
first
duckrabbit
product
i
have
sampled
and
so
far
im
impressed
there
is
a
complexity
of
malty
goodness
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
coming
back
for
more
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
hints
thin
head
aroma
is
roasted
malt
sweet
with
a
touch
of
smoke
pleasing
expresso
roasted
malt
flavor
a
touch
of
lactose
tartness
balances
the
flavor
thick
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
milk
sweet
stouts
from
a
brewery
that
does
dark
beer
well
recommended
a
solid
tasty
stout
note
i
have
also
had
this
on
tap
and
remember
it
as
slightly
better
than
the
bottle
offering
if
you
find
it
on
tap
order
it
overall
a
tasty
and
relatively
complex
milk
stout
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
this
full
dark
brown
beer
is
great
for
any
one
who
likes
genies
it
pours
correct
it
will
have
a
nice
foam
head
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
roasted
flavor
the
smooth
taste
aroma
and
filling
ness
has
allowed
me
to
buy
this
beer
again
again
availalbe
in
bottles
and
but
tastes
better
out
of
the
tap
i
did
not
like
previous
milk
stouts
ive
had
but
duckrabbit
did
the
style
proud
with
this
one
enjoyable
brew
with
a
shocking
visual
effect
d
this
is
an
easydrinking
milk
stout
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
goo
but
not
great
imo
thanks
to
my
boy
kevin
hurleymanvw
for
giving
me
this
one
to
try
this
beer
totally
blew
me
away
others
have
described
the
colors
aromas
and
other
particulars
so
ill
just
say
that
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
milk
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
not
as
thick
and
not
as
sweet
as
others
ive
had
its
the
kind
of
stout
that
you
can
just
enjoy
drinking
without
feeling
bloated
after
the
first
couple
of
bottles
poured
aggressively
into
my
sam
adams
glass
came
up
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
dissappeared
quickly
very
minimal
lacing
really
not
as
black
as
id
thought
it
should
be
dark
with
ruby
highlights
ive
seen
brown
ales
darker
than
this
one
smell
is
of
smokey
roasty
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
candy
in
there
too
taste
is
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
that
milk
sugar
taste
that
i
have
yet
to
figure
out
how
to
describe
taste
is
roasty
and
sweet
the
body
is
medium
high
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
sticky
overall
a
decent
brew
a
little
light
in
color
for
the
style
but
highly
quaffable
just
the
same
my
second
duckrabbit
the
second
good
one
i
am
impressed
with
the
brewery
so
far
call
me
crazy
but
a
stout
should
be
pretty
dark
this
one
isnt
dark
enough
it
has
a
moderately
dark
mahogany
colored
body
that
shines
deep
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
was
initially
very
big
but
fell
really
quickly
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
barbecue
there
is
a
big
smokey
presence
in
there
along
with
dark
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
again
this
aroma
isnt
quite
what
i
expect
for
the
style
roast
is
up
front
and
dominating
in
this
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
smoke
in
there
and
this
still
reminds
me
of
barbecue
a
bit
the
lactose
sweetness
that
essentially
defines
the
style
is
also
definitely
there
in
fact
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
the
body
is
the
only
thing
that
is
dead
on
decently
heavy
but
not
too
much
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
mostly
because
it
is
too
sweet
with
not
nearly
enough
balance
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
from
the
high
carbonation
the
aroma
features
dark
roasted
malts
and
sweet
chocolate
the
taste
is
dark
and
roasty
up
front
with
a
bittersweet
finish
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
heavy
carbonation
detracts
from
the
beer
but
it
is
still
highly
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
is
recommended
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
fairly
opaque
black
slightly
ruby
hued
with
a
good
tan
head
to
start
with
fading
to
a
nice
film
not
much
lacing
though
the
aroma
is
a
little
timid
but
nice
notes
of
lactose
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
perhaps
in
taste
there
is
even
more
coffee
the
lactose
quite
nice
in
counterpoint
again
chocolate
is
nice
but
this
coffee
and
lactose
battling
it
out
is
kind
of
weird
kind
of
good
the
mouth
is
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
not
perfectly
but
good
enough
the
body
medium
full
and
the
carbonation
rightfully
restrained
quite
a
nice
beer
taste
and
mouth
feel
wasnt
doing
much
for
me
until
i
pushed
it
away
and
let
it
warm
the
beer
really
began
to
shine
very
good
feel
and
a
complex
taste
good
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
dark
brown
with
some
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
foams
up
with
a
tan
head
and
that
is
sustained
by
a
vigorous
level
of
carbonation
very
cola
like
in
appearance
smell
of
sweet
malts
and
some
sweet
chocolate
some
whiskey
alcohol
notes
show
themselves
also
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
this
followed
by
a
nice
smokeyness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
overcarbonated
finishes
with
a
little
bitterness
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
top
to
bottom
though
the
duck
rabbit
brews
have
been
somewhat
of
a
dissapointment
they
are
all
better
than
average
but
none
of
them
have
really
shined
they
seam
to
have
a
fairly
consistant
problem
with
overcarbonation
that
detracts
from
most
of
the
ones
ive
tried
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
lactose
sweetness
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
smokey
and
a
small
bitterness
sweet
with
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
sticky
sweet
and
small
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
sweetness
with
a
small
bitter
and
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
either
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
then
im
afraid
they
would
be
too
sweet
so
for
me
not
a
great
session
beer
but
definitely
a
good
dessert
beer
i
would
keep
them
around
all
the
time
if
they
were
something
i
could
get
locally
for
a
milk
stout
i
can
really
see
myself
drinking
this
for
an
entire
night
a
nice
sweetness
keeps
tame
the
robustness
of
the
coffee
and
bite
some
dark
fruits
are
at
work
here
too
black
plum
prune
and
raisin
this
leaves
the
aftertaste
a
bit
fruity
dry
and
remenants
of
sweetness
just
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
more
an
easy
drink
for
a
milk
stout
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
i
werent
allergic
to
it
its
pretty
good
id
buy
this
one
again
or
maybe
order
a
pint
at
the
bar
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
mixed
six
pack
from
total
wine
pours
very
dark
with
a
tan
head
that
went
away
slowly
the
nose
was
chocolate
and
coffee
with
malts
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
at
first
that
fades
to
a
bitter
ending
is
smooth
and
really
good
a
very
nice
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
it
really
really
reminds
me
of
deschutes
black
butte
porter
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
its
a
shame
that
we
cant
get
any
duckrabbit
brews
out
west
they
claim
to
be
the
dark
beer
specialists
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
theyre
doing
a
hell
of
a
job
thanks
again
to
ncvbc
drinkability
very
tasty
very
sessionable
for
the
style
though
its
chances
improve
toward
the
colder
months
of
the
year
thanks
to
lrm
for
the
trade
drinkabilitynotes
drs
milk
stout
is
very
drinkable
plenty
of
chocolatey
goodness
followed
by
a
nice
coffee
like
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
super
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
lactose
lends
a
very
nice
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
a
really
nice
stout
too
bad
its
not
available
in
dc
definitely
one
i
will
buy
again
on
my
next
trip
to
nc
recommended
seek
and
enjoy
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
and
laces
carbonation
bubbles
visible
all
around
the
sides
smells
mild
in
every
way
but
i
pick
out
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
bakers
chocolate
slight
vanilla
and
a
bitter
hop
bite
to
be
honest
a
little
weaker
and
less
sweet
than
i
though
it
would
be
but
still
good
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
tickle
on
the
tongue
from
carbonation
great
drinkability
my
first
drink
from
the
duckrabbit
well
and
a
tasty
brew
that
didnt
dissapoint
d
i
really
cant
come
up
with
one
bad
thing
to
say
about
this
beer
excellent
any
way
you
look
at
it
in
my
book
i
think
this
is
my
first
ever
5
beer
thanks
to
limesmut
for
this
excellent
beer
might
have
to
trade
with
you
again
for
more
of
this
stuff
creamyslightly
grainy
edgesome
smoothness
not
as
smooth
as
most
of
the
milk
stouts
ive
tasted
great
mouthwatering
taste
making
me
crave
more
lots
of
drinkabilitya
little
more
body
than
other
mils
stouts
ive
tried
very
nice
beer
like
the
label
states
the
dark
beer
specialists
had
a
few
of
the
darks
beers
from
duck
rabbit
all
were
excellent
beer
wish
i
could
get
these
beers
in
my
area
give
these
beers
a
trt
if
you
can
enjoyed
them
all
so
far
d
im
a
sucker
for
that
heavy
roasted
malt
arrangement
when
done
properly
and
duckrabbit
seems
to
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
style
bottle
courtesy
of
secret
santa
poured
a
medium
black
color
stout
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
dark
chocolate
notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
slightly
bitter
roasted
malt
with
some
dark
chocolate
body
is
tad
too
light
for
the
style
but
creamy
texture
was
well
enjoyed
very
well
done
overall
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
very
drinkable
brew
and
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
one
of
hte
nicer
offerings
ive
tried
from
duckrabbit
very
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
sticky
on
the
palate
full
bodied
and
very
delightfully
silky
minimal
alcohol
with
nice
mouthfeel
makes
this
entirely
drinkable
as
long
as
the
beer
is
pourable
this
could
become
a
mainstay
for
the
stout
category
in
anybodys
fridge
for
now
i
will
leave
it
out
but
will
certainly
revisist
this
probably
in
the
winter
a
very
fine
milk
stout
indeed
very
dry
finish
with
some
hop
bitterness
mid
palate
is
rich
and
roasty
with
layers
of
lactose
following
through
to
the
finish
plum
and
anise
with
caramel
drops
and
chocolate
coffee
flavors
round
things
out

is
medium
solid
and

abv
a
brew
i
could
drink
many
of
especially
on
an
upcoming
college
football
saturday
unfortunately
i
dont
have
access
to
duck
rabbit
brews
drinkabilitynotes
an
unwaveringly
superb
example
simply
excellent
im
a
big
fan
of
the
bigger
duck
rabbit
offerings
and
i
also
like
milk
stouts
this
is
nmy
favorite
of
the
lower
abv
duck
rabbits
and
while
it
is
merely
a
good
rather
than
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
i
still
like
it
on
ocassion
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
milky
and
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
sour
grain
the
taste
is
equally
as
milky
and
sweet
with
definite
chocolate
notes
blended
well
with
the
milkiness
the
mouthfeel
is
milky
and
just
a
little
sticky
this
version
is
almost
a
dessert
rather
than
a
beer
which
hurts
its
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
wanting
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
black
in
the
center
brown
at
the
edges
and
possessing
a
perfect
light
tan
head
that
starts
out
two
inches
thick
and
drops
to
about
half
that
in
a
minute
or
two
it
smells
slightly
like
milk
chocolate
not
chocolate
milk
the
taste
has
milk
chocolate
flavors
with
some
hop
bitterness
that
made
my
mouth
pucker
slightly
for
beers
under
6
abv
duck
rabbit
beers
certainly
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
much
like
all
duck
rabbit
beers
this
was
a
very
tasty
ale
i
think
i
have
only
had
one
of
their
beers
that
i
didnt
think
was
great
barleywine
that
was
a
drain
pour
m
creamy
with
roasted
dry
finish
nice
carbonation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
very
dark
brown
with
virtually
no
light
showing
through
head
is
minimal
when
poured
properly
short
lived
with
little
lacing
smell
is
a
little
fruity
with
licorice
flavors
of
roasted
malt
oak
cofee
alcohol
comes
through
in
waves
and
noticeable
for
a
fairly
low
abv
mouthfeel
is
oily
foamy
with
a
tannic
sensation
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
highly
drinkable
and
another
fine
example
of
a
north
carolina
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
basically
black
with
a
huge
fluffy
three
finger
tan
colored
head
that
takes
a
while
to
die
down
lacing
is
pretty
good
but
doesnt
hold
to
the
glass
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
smell
has
a
nice
roasted
nut
character
up
from
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
that
tickles
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
chocolate
appears
on
the
tongue
midway
aftertaste
has
a
very
coffee
like
tingle
medium
body
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
this
style
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
still
a
beer
worth
trying
d
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
some
carbonation
huge
two
finger
plus
foamy
tannish
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweetbitter
lots
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
milk
stout
but
would
have
like
a
fresher
bottle
notes
thanks
to
mikesgroove
for
the
12
oz
sample
via
no
name
bif
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
lot
of
foam
even
when
poured
conservatively
smells
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
only
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
as
would
be
expected
in
this
style
mouthfeel
is
luxorius
this
is
not
a
session
brew
but
a
great
brew
to
end
the
day
with
yet
another
great
beer
from
duckrabbit
d
overall
this
was
very
good
and
i
would
score
another
one
for
the
guys
over
a
duck
rabbit
they
really
seem
to
know
wheat
they
are
doing
and
keep
scoring
round
after
round
with
their
brews
great
sessionable
beer
this
is
from
a
bottle
aquired
through
a
beer
of
the
month
club
over
a
year
ago
it
didnt
get
into
the
fridge
until
some
months
ago
i
think
it
suffered
a
bit
as
theres
a
bit
of
a
tang
to
it
that
i
didnt
notice
when
i
first
drank
it
after
it
arrived
did
pour
with
a
nice
foamy
textured
frothy
head
lots
of
lace
light
roasty
malty
sweet
nose
mouth
filling
body
served
a
nice
deep
black
with
a
frothy
cappuccino
head
that
slowly
diminished
but
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
strong
and
was
dominated
by
roasted
barley
the
taste
had
the
typical
stout
flavors
but
was
also
had
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
from
the
lactose
sugar
this
also
gave
it
a
rich
smoothness
and
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
another
great
offering
by
a
great
local
brewery
i
recommend
trying
this
one
with
some
strawberries
trust
me
d
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
the
most
part
and
its
relatively
reasonable
abv
make
it
a
beer
thats
easy
enough
to
put
back
a
few
i
didnt
find
myself
going
gaga
over
this
one
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
too
often
taste
is
definately
a
highlight
of
this
beer
at
first
sip
im
thinking
soy
sauce
with
sweet
caramel
notes
but
the
salty
profile
degrades
after
the
beer
warms
and
im
left
with
nice
a
nice
malty
chocolatecoffee
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
almost
unpleasantly
so
little
aftertaste
and
the
malts
do
little
to
further
the
cause
id
have
this
again
its
definately
worth
the
buy
but
i
cannot
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
of
dr
milk
stout
just
on
the
pour
alone
i
not
only
got
a
big
thick
deeptanlightbrown
head
but
the
nose
was
prevalent
and
attentiongetting
i
caught
notes
of
cocoa
chocolate
and
a
light
smokiness
and
that
was
without
even
leaning
in
in
doing
so
i
also
captured
toffee
and
coffee
perfect
for
midmorning
on
a
snow
day
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thick
and
i
got
a
lot
of
the
chocolate
and
toffee
mix
on
the
tongue
which
reminded
me
of
a
heath
bar
the
finish
had
more
of
a
smoky
coffee
richness
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
a
milk
stout
more
like
a
dry
stout
but
still
very
good
drinkability
better
than
i
expected
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
but
for
me
that
was
a
good
thing
because
i
shy
away
from
the
overt
sweetness
of
some
styles
d
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
i
could
have
several
of
these
especially
paired
with
bbq
wings
a
keeper
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
pint
glass
appears
an
almost
opaque
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
caramel
colored
foam
that
lingers
on
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
and
bittersweet
cocoa
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
medium
body
that
leans
a
little
toward
the
thin
side
a
very
nice
stout
and
one
i
could
see
becoming
a
favorite
part
of
my
rotation
as
supply
dictates
cheers
d
wonderful
selection
made
for
a
great
afterdinner
beer
thank
you
very
much
brouche
thanks
to
oldirtysurfer
for
sending
this
bottle
my
way
poured
into
a
nonic
this
is
stout
is
lighter
in
color
than
others
of
its
variety
dark

with
russet
highlights
and
a
modest
but
dense
sandcolored
head
sourish
black
malt
aromas
mix
with
a
slight
essence
of
vanilla
along
with
a
soft
cocoa
scent
all
with
a
bit
of
mineral
twang
swirling
through
it
some
rather
faint
cocoa
powder
comes
through
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
yogurt
sourness
otherwise
this
is
fairly
roasty
and
dry
almost
like
a
porter
in
fact
i
had
to
check
the
label
on
the
bottle
to
make
sure
i
was
reviewing
the
correct
duckrabbit
beer
as
i
also
have
a
couple
newlyacquired
bottles
of
their
porter
that
said
this
is
a
finetasting
brew
that
feels
full
in
the
mouth
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sharp
carbonation
bite
at
the
finish
leaving
an
overall
impression
of
dryness
on
the
palate
very
sessionable
but
perhaps
not
exactly
what
fans
of
the
sweeter
lactoseheavy
versions
of
this
style
may
be
looking
for
milk
stouts
have
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
one
does
the
style
proud
an
excellent
brew
12oz
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
malts
and
coffee
taste
of
dark
roasted

with
some
coffee
and
cream
notes
mouth
feel
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
is
still
good
with
a
lightmedium
feel
drinkability
is
very
easy
with
the
robust
flavors
and
light
body
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
session
brew
for
myself
another
very
good
beer
from
duckrabbit
and
of
course
a
hip
hip
hooray
to
blackie
for
this
overall
impression
very
nice
one
of
the
best
american
milk
stouts
i
have
tried
thanks
again
mikesgroove
this
was
a
good
bottle
of
beer
d
a
tasty
treat
had
two
and
called
it
a
satisfied
evening
d
i
really
liked
this
a
lot
nice
balance
and
flavors
that
are
robust
and
likable
my
wife
tried
and
found
this
to
be
too
bitter
for
her
tastes
she
wanted
more
of
the
sweet
maltiness
however
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
milk
stouts
ive
had
mouthfeel
was
light
medium
with
a
little
more
of
a
couple
of
things
this
one
could
be
world
class
very
drinkable
a
good
solid
tasty
milk
stout
thanks
oldirtysurfer
for
this
beer
full
of
malt
flavor
with
enough
balance
to
keep
the
defense
honest
sorry
its
college
football
season
coffee
dominated
with
a
smooth
sweet
finish
dry
and
slightly
sour
almost
in
the
oatmeal
stout
tradition
but
without
the
thick
meaty
cereal
character
of
an
os
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
thicken
up
but
still
an
enjoyable
stout
worth
trying
ducks
beaks
dont
look
like
that
its
got
to
be
a
rabbit
this
is
a
very
drinkable
milk
stout
that
doesnt
weigh
down
its
smoothness
and
yet
provides
enough
body
and
substance
to
please
the
stout
enthusiast
the
sweetness
that
is
found
in
the
nose
is
present
but
not
overbearing
in
the
taste
i
much
preferred
this
take
on
the
style
to
a
mackesons
which
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
i
enjoyed
this
so
much
i
had
a
couple
and
did
not
get
too
full
even
though
i
drank
them
soon
after
a
meal
i
have
been
generally
impressed
with
the
beers
from
this
brewery
the
taste
has
a
small
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
beginning
the
bitter
coffee
flavor
is
very
distinctive
after
warming
there
is
a
definite
sweet
tasting
maltiness
mixed
in
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
flavor
dies
down
and
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
smooth
out
a
very
good
stout
this
is
my
introduction
to
duck
rabbit
and
its
been
a
good
one
a
nice
roasty
sweet
stout
very
satisfying
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
few
milk
stouts
ive
sampled
so
my
impressions
of
the
type
is
limited
to
a
xxx
makison
stout
etc
type
very
willing
to
continue
to
sample
from
this
group
as
the
winter
months
approach
the
metalliciron
twang
is
interesting
and
i
hope
doesnt
appear
in
my
second
bottlepack
im
leaving
this
as
part
of
my
review
unless
i
taste
otherwise
on
subsequent
bottles
d
very
drinkable
a
veritable
gem
from
duckrabbit
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
milks
stouts
ive
had
not
bad
poured
nearly
black
with
some
sand
coloured
foam
on
top
that
hung
around
for
several
minutes
nice
moderate
lacing
which
looked
nice
as
well
lots
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
of
course
but
there
was
a
metallic
smell
present
here
that
was
fairly
detectable
enough
for
me
to
give
smell
a
3
0
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
a
bitter
chocolate
taste
dominated
finished
medium
dry
with
no
hops
detectable
anywhere
this
is
certainly
unbalanced
to
the
side
of
malt
good
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
feel
a
beer
of
this
style
should
be
there
was
also
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
would
care
for
overall
you
could
do
much
much
worse
but
this
is
simply
a
good
beer
not
great
or
fantastic
just
good
a
dark
brownblack
beer
with
some
ruby
highlights
has
a
small
creamy
beige
head
and
a
little
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
a
good
dose
of
roasted
malt
with
a
smooth
chocolate
backgroun
and
a
hint
of
coffee
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
to
match
the
chocolaty
start
to
the
taste
has
a
nice
esspresso
note
near
the
end
and
a
light
sweetness
on
the
finish
this
one
is
fairly
drinkable
but
the
richness
may
be
a
bit
much
to
handle
another
solid
offering
from
duckrabbit
great
darkbrown
color
very
minimal
smell
taste
is
very
enjoyable
strong
coffee
almond
and
charcoal
overtones
a
heavy
beer
especially
perfect
for
wintertime
best
enjoyed
alone
as
opposed
to
with
a
meal
definetely
reccomended
for
a
try
for
fans
of
darker
beers
the
taste
is
good
very
dark
malts
coffee
mild
hops
and
molasses
mostly
again
quite
comparable
to
the
triple
x
but
a
lot
less
sweet
and
some
would
argue
therefore
more
drinkable
its
smooth
and
creamy
thanks
to
the
lactose
maintains
a
great
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
and
while
not
quite
as
complex
as
you
know
what
it
still
manages
to
hold
its
own
i
dig
the
fact
that
its
brewed
more
or
less
locally
the
brewer
paul
is
a
great
guy
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
his
beer
interesting
stout
that
is
a
little
different
extremely
coffee
flavored
stout
that
i
really
dont
think
belongs
in
the
milk
stout
category
all
in
all
the
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
if
i
had
around
here
in
michigan
i
would
definitely
keep
coming
back
to
its
a
stout
that
would
have
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
from
allaround
drinkability
to
afordability
i
think
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
just
above
average
not
a
bad
beer
just
missing
something
imo
aroma
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
coffee
very
dark
the
brewhouse
had
low
lightint
so
not
sure
if
light
would
have
given
off
any
unique
hues
very
thin
tan
head
with
very
small
fine
bubbles
minimal
lacing
medium
bitterness
hits
the
palate
but
gives
way
to
dark
malt
flavors
and
espresso
a
good
froth
releases
the
dark
malt
flovors
chocolate
or
balck
patent
maybe
chocolate
milk
and
sweetness
emerge
also
with
the
bitterness
coming
back
around
on
the
finish
there
is
a
bitterness
from
the
darker
malts
and
it
melds
well
with
all
th
other
flavors
very
good
milk
stout
from
the
eastern
nc
brewery
cheers
postscript
18
months
later
and
another
6pack
of
this
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
was
much
less
sticky
but
way
too
carbonated
mouthfeel
remains
troublesome
on
this
one
glad
i
tried
it
but
ill
pass
it
up
next
time
beer
is
good
happy
chocolate

but
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
on
nitrogen
best
before
606
notched
on
the
bottle
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
nice
tan
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
is
initially
sweet
with
lactose
vanilla
and
cream
along
with
some
mild
roastiness
and
a
slight
floral
hops
presence
nearly
perfect
for
a
milk
stout
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
roastiness
followed
by
some
lactose
sweetness
vanilla
cream
some
oily
hops
and
a
slight
metallic
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth

slightly
watery
and
the

is
good
overall
a
solid
dr

all
of

ive
had
so
far
have
been
well
made
this
beer
is
dark
no
light
penetrates
the
beer
there
is
a
thick
tan
head
this
is
what
a
stout
should
look
like
the
smell
is
mixed
roasted
notes
and
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
and
other
roasted
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
good
lasting
roasty
aftertaste
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
good
oatmeal
stout
reccomended
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
limited
flavors
and
body
really
limit
this
beer
carbonation
is
light
as
well
no
off
flavors
at
least
poured
several
12ounce
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
week
to
get
a
good
feel
for
the
beer
came
out
a
dark
brownblack
with
some
reddish
undertones
when
held
up
to
a
light
nice
thick
beigecolored
head
good
retention
from
the
one
that
was
poured
early
in
the
week
the
head
for
the
one
that
was
poured
later
in
the
week
dissipated
fairly
fast
some
moderate
amounts
of
lacing
from
both
though
a
heavy
cream
or
sweet
cream
aroma
is
present
with
burnt
undertones
the
one
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
came
across
creamy
smooth
and
a
little
heavy
on
the
tongue
while
the
later
one
came
out
just
as
creamy
smooth
but
not
as
heavy
not
as
sweet
as
the
previous
one
also
honestly
its
a
very
decent
attempt
at
a
sweet
stout
however
i
would
wait
a
few
days
after
putting
a
sixpack
in
the
fridge
before
popping
one
open
pours
thick
and
dark
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
fades
more
quickly
than
i
would
have
liked
smells
strong
of
coffee
and
milk
but
has
nice
hoppy
notes
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
a
dominance
of
coffee
but
one
can
detect
the
hops
with
every
swallow
feels
pleasent
to
the
palate
aside
from
the
bitterness
which
can
be
a
little
obtrusive
but
for
overall
drinkability
and
price
this
stout
will
please
cheers
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
example
of
a
milk
stout
ive
had
but
still
good
thanks
to
lindsay
and
emily
for
bringing
these
back
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
but
still
made
for
a
smooth
enjoyable
stout
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
this
brewerys
quite
good
porter
for
a
milk
stout
i
really
didnt
get
much
lactose
sweetness
that
should
be
the
characteristic
a
bit
thin
with
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
and
likewise
moderate
roasted
malt
flavors
didnt
bring
to
mind
the
fortifying
aspect
of
a
milk
stout
this
was
rather
bland
and
onedimensional
very
drinkable
as
well
lower
abv
makes
this
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
would
buy
it
again
the
duckrabbit
craft
brewery
claims
on
this
label
at
least
to
be
the
dark
beer
specialists
having
tasted
their
porter
and
this
milk
stout
id
say
that
they
have
every
right
to
make
that
claim
this
is
a
tasty
offering
from
an
upandcomer
from
the
great
state
of
north
carolina
thanks
to
nclifestyle
my
duckrabbit
connection
for
the
bottle
chocolate
and
mild
used
coffee
ground
come

quarter
sized
mocha

very
bitter
in
the
fore
with
mild
chocolate
creamysmoothiness
through
the
middle
and
into
the
finish
a
very
serviceable
if
not
stellar
stout
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
thick
and
chewey
just
right
find
it
now
and
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
this
was
a
pretty
typical
milk
stout
medium
tan
head
and
an
opaque
black
body
aroma
of
roasted
malt
coffee
caramel
possibly
come
chocolate
the
taste
was
more
of
the
acrid
coffeebean
taste
roasted
malts
mild
hops
and
a
semisweet
smooth
aftertaste
indicative
of
a
milk
stout
it
had
mild
carbonation
and
a
relatively
smooth
body
which
made
it
pretty
enjoyable
not
the
best
ive
had
but
gotta
give
a
shout
out
to
an
nc
brewery
for
giving
it
a
shot
not
a
bad

great

with

my
experience
with
this
beer
probably
ended
with
my
club
shipment
i
have
never
seen
them
distributed
in
the
njny
region
but
if
they
ever
are
i
would
surely
consider
purchasing
some
of
their
beers
poured

full
overall

i
would
not
mind
tracking
this
one
down
on
my
next
trip
back
east
while
not
nearly
as
flashy
or
bold
as
other
stouts
its
still
a
good
beer
that
with
a
little
tweaking
could
make
for
a
really
great
milk
stout
being
a
lover
of
milk
stouts
i
had
to
try
this
one
it
looks
creamy
and
opaque
black
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
accompanied
the
last
sip
the
aromas
are
of
black
and
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
lactose
to
add
a
complex
souring
the
flavors
are
strong
bittersweet
without
being
grainy
light
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
rise
out
of
the
barley
malt
showing
mild
astringency
and
lactic
sweetness
and
sourness
light
hops
show
in
the
finish
the
body
is
firm
and
quite
creamy
the
finish
is
similar
but
shows
a
little
graininess
and
harshness
albeit
light
all
in
all
better
than
most
but
i
have
had
much
better
hops
nugget
fuggle
recieved
three
12oz
bottles
of
this
stout
in
a
beer
of
the
month
shipment
striking
label
and
fascinating
story
behind
the
brewer
as
well
a
thinking
mans
stout
to
be
certain
id
buy
it
again
but
wont
break
any
land
speed
records
to
do
it
body
thickness
could
be
a
bit
more
beefed
up
but
the
subtle
impartation
of
hops
and
lactose
sweetness
combined
with
less
acridity
than
usual
for
the
style
makes
this
a
nice
treat
though
not
really
sessionable
overall
impression
very
drinkable
rich
flavors
and
texture
are
a
treat
and
there
are
some
mild
hops
that
give
it
some
complexity
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
not
as
good
as
the
porter
imho
but
probably
my
favorite
milk
stout
nevertheless
id
have
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
sweet
but
not
overly
so
not
big
or
really
complex
but
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
think
its
slightly
underrated
drinkabilty
i
think
more
than
2
of
these
in
one
sitting
would
be
difficult
due
to
its
texture
and
overall
body
drinkability
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
why
you
would
want
more
than
one
is
beyond
me
this
beer
pours
at
what
appears
to
be
a
rich
black
color
but
after
holding
it
up
to
the
light
its
a
deep
deep
ruby
the
smell
is
of
roasted
maltshints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
some
kind
of
nut
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
on
the
pour
the
head
forms
small
and
disappears
pretty
quickly
super
malty
with
maybe
a
hint
of
underlying
hops
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
the
coffee
taste
really
takes
over
over
all
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
will
buy
again
for
sure
been
wanting
to
try
something
from
this
brewery
for
a
while
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
no
lace
nose
is
slightly
toasted
and
sweet
flavor
is
full
of
milk
and
dark
chocolate
slight
toffee
and
caramel
too
nice
subtle
bitter
finish
just
a
tad
short
of
heavy
on
the
toasted
malts
some
heft
to
this
beer
with
a
very
full
flavor
however
the
richness
of
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
exhausting
after
a
bit
drinkability
speaks
for
itself
very
nice
milk
stout
in
my
opinion
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
tan
head
above
the
dark
brownish
burgundy
brew
head
quickly
fades
to
a
scant
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
sweet
creamy
dark
malts
almost
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
here
taste
is
sweet
dark
malts
with
little
to
no
bitterness
seemingly
due
to
the
added
sugar
which
is
as
it
should
be
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
with
smoothness
that
just
invites
another
mouthful
or
two
or
bottle
check
it
out
black
body
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
drops
quickly
no
remnants
of
that
head
are
left
on
the
glass
big
roasted
malt
notes
in
the
aroma
also
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
light
sourness
flavor
starts
off
sweet
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
light
creamy
sourness
plays
well
in
it
finishes
on
a
sweet
toasty
note
body
is
medium
and
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
this
has
enough
going
for
it
that
i
could
have
a
few
in
a
session
solid
example
of
the
style
all
around
thanks
goes
to
my
buddy
jason
for
the
bottles
drinkability
a
nice
sipping
stout
that
grows
on
you
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
regulars
in
the
stout
offerings
very
drinkable
while
maintaining
the
qualities
of
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
this
has
a
crisp
feel
initially
which
i
think
might
be
due
to
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
though
nothing
offensive
about
this
one
just
a
bit
subtle
overall
thanks
dad
for
tasting
and
reviewing
with
me
no
born
on
date
poured
a
dark
color
with
a
small
head
and
very
little
lacing
sweet
smell
malty
and
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
good
guiness
like
stout
from
a
nice
small
town
brewery
here
in
north
carolina
i
would
love
the
chance
to
take
a
tour
of
the
facilities
when
in
the
area
next
even
with
the
thickness
of
the
body
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
even
on
this
hot
summer
day
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
wish
it
had
just
a
hint
more
lactose
sweetness
going
on
slight
14
inch
light
tan
head
semi
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tint
of
red
aromas
of
roast
and
a
creamy
lactose
smell
not
much
more
flavors
of
the
same
earthy
and
roasty
well
carbonated
somewhat
average
mouthfeel
and
a
long
aftertaste
of
roast
flavor
nothing
extravagant
anywhere
with
this
beer
but
well
made
and
drinkable
in
any
case
a
good
idea
to
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
noticeably
thin
on
the
pour
appearance
somewhat
akin
to
pepsi
nice
roasty
lactic
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
candy
sugar
starts
off
with
a
milky
sweetness
which
blends
nicely
into
the
darker
roastier
baking
chocolate
flavors
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
as
well
keeping
this
pretty
fairly
balanced
has
a
mild
touch
of
carbonation
any
more
and
this
would
be
some
kind
of
odd
chocolate
soda
i
will
say
that
i
enjoy
the
flavor
on
this
one
a
lot
thicken
it
up
a
bit
into
manstout
levels
and
its
really
a
nice
brew
a
good
sweeter
dessert
stout
a
session
stout
if
there
is
such
a
thing
drinkability
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
latte
i
got
from
starbucks
this
weekend
not
too
keen
on
stouts
but
i
was
given
this
one
by
a
friend
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
at
the
hickory
hops
fest
on
april
9
2005
had
a
couple
of
sampler
glasses
of
this
one
which
i
really
enjoyed
appearance
is
deep
brown
essentially
opaque
with
a
quickly
vanishing
beige
head
some
patchy
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
but
its
a
bit
difficult
to
judge
overall
appearance
from
the
small
glasses
aroma
is
nice
with
lots
of
burnt
roast
malt
character
tempered
by
carob
and
some
sweet
smelling
lacto
aromas
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
for
a
stout
but
carbonation
is
good
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
bitter
dark
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
some
sweet
lactose
hops
are
difficult
to
discern
and
a
more
assertive
hops
profile
would
benefit
this
one
quite
a
bit
finishes
with
a
dark
roasty
malt
bitterness
that
lasts
several
minutes
very
well
done
for
a
sweet
stout
i
look
forward
to
sampling
the
bottled
version
of
this
as
its
this
small
brewerys
biggest
seller
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
color
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
so
quickly
i
almost
forgot
it
had
one
aromas
are
a
mix
of
roast
and
smoke
like
tones
along
with
a
slight
lactic
note
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
for
taste
this
one
was
quite
a
surprise
after
being
somewhat
dissapointed
by
the
appearance
of
this
brew
there
was
a
nice
intermingling
of
flavors
they
started
of
slightly
sweet
with
a
deep
chocolate
tone
to
it
following
there
was
a
nice
mix
between
the
roasty
flavors
and
the
lactic
milky
bits
to
this
brew
the
finish
was
sweet
and
just
had
a
slight
hint
of
astringency
and
smoke
that
balanced
things
out
quite
nicely
the
body
to
this
brew
was
fairly
light
but
there
was
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
overall
a
nice
tasting
brew
but
they
really
need
to
get
their
problems
with
their
head
retention
fixed
a
bit
i
received
this
beer
in
a
trade
with
a
gentleman
in
north
carolina
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
yellow
and
red
hues
in
it
and
pretty
much
no
head
for
a
stout
it
was
certainly
missing
the
impenatrable
dark
color
and
even
a
decent
head
on
top
the
nose
is
roasty
with
sweet
malt
scents
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
watery
up
front
but
it
is
followed
by
a
burnt
almond
flavor
in
the
middle
along
with
chocolate
and
a
floral
hoppiness
at
the
end
the
hps
could
have
redeemed
some
of
this
beer
but
they
are
just
not
seductive
enough
in
flavor
or
aroma
to
do
the
job
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
sandyearthy
character
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
just
not
that
good
pours
deep
reddish
black
not
as
dark
as
some
other
stouts
moderate
bone
head
quickly
fizzles
into
a
thin
ring
sparse
lace
aromas
of
choc
malt
molasses
peat
and
caramel
flavor
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
nice
lingering
charred
malt
roastinesss
thin
bodied
and
light
on
the
palate
too
light
i
like
a
little
more
meatiness
in
a
stout
ok
overall
but
i
wont
be
writing
home
about
it
pours
black
but
with
some
deep
red
highlights
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
nothing
behindmilk
chocolate
is
very
prevelant
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
smokiness
and
a
roasted
coffee
hint
nice
deeply
roasted
flavor
with
big
doses
of
cocoa
and
smokealot
of
flavor
melding
going
on
but
seemed
a
little
light
in
the
mouthfeel
department
otheriwise
a
top
notch
brew
a
easy
drinker
with
alot
of
flavor
needs
a
little
tweaking
to
be
great
in
my
opinion
pours
a
deep
dark
black
that
allows
just
the
faintest
bit
of
light
to
shine
through
small
tan
head
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
mocha
and
briny
peaty
smokiness
medium
body
is
slightly
chewy
palate
is
dominated
by
roasted
malt
up
front
mellowing
into
a
marginally
malty
sweetness
typical
of
a
milk
stout
decent
and
sturdy
although
something
is
missing
for
this
to
be
a
great
beer
drinkability
a
nice
sipping
stout
that
ultimately
becomes
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
