pours
a
reddish
strawberry
color
with
a
very
small
quickly
dissipating
head
scents
of
cherries
tastes
sour
no
malt
or
hops
present
and
too
sour
for
my
liking
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
during
a
sitting
but
a
treat
nonetheless
refreshing
polarizing
will
get
your
less
experienced
beer
drinking
friends
talking
for
good
or
ill
well
rounded
beer
it
gets
better
as
the
beer
settles
to
the
room
temperature
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
yeast
to
come
through
but
i
get
that
its
not
the
intention
this
one
was
a
very
good
beer
from
dieu
du
ciel
it
almost
seemed
like
a
mix
between
a
fruit
beer
an
ipa
with
some
medium
strength
bitterness
and
good
fruity
flavours
throughout
i
was
definitely
surprised
with
this
one
it
went
down
very
easily
is
definitely
one
that
id
pick
up
again
not
bad
not
too
flavorful
interesting
beer
to
have
as
i
really
couldnt
get
a
handle
on
everything
in
this
beer
tmo
taste
isnt
as
in
your
face
as
the
nose
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
floral
beer
there
is
some
fruit
present
as
well
for
good
measure
peaches
and
mango
it
is
an
interesting
beer
body
is
fairly
full
almost
sangria
like
in
a
way
overall
not
something
that
was
really
my
thing
happy
to
get
the
taste
very
sessionable
and
also
a
really
bright
and
complex
ale
pleasant
spiciness
and
floral
character
more
acidic
and
tart
than
i
would
expect
given
the
body
but
it
keeps
it
from
going
down
the
route
of
the
overly
sweet
fruit
beer
and
for
that
ddc
gets
my
approval
this
is
a
very
unique
and
well
balanced
beer
would
recommend
it
might
not
be
a
regular
beer
but
it
is
a
tasty
and
memorable
beer
aroma
is
quite
floral
and
a
bit
fruity
good
sweettart
balance
in
the
flavor
where
hibiscus
is
also
obvious
but
not
overdone
lively
but
soft
carbonation
lends
a
fine
mouthfeel
o
i
like
but
dont
love
this
beer
i
think
it
is
more
me
and
the
style
vs
the
quality
of
the
beer
in
fact
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
is
probably
a
homerun
for
the
style
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
nicely
done
and
worth
trying
to
me
these
guys
can
do
no
wrong
so
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
their
hibiscus
beer
is
fantastic
its
light
and
tart
and
clean
different
from
the
perfume
forward
intensity
of
others
and
with
the
exception
of
io
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
is
one
of
the
best
hibiscus
beers
around
a
nose
of
soft
flower
petals
mineral
water
and
vibrant
spicy
ale
yeast
thats
not
quite
belgian
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
all
the
hibiscus
and
most
of
the
spice
coming
on
the
back
end
lots
of
pale
malt
up
front
biscuity
but
light
clean
and
delicate
carbonation
is
prickly
and
its
just
right
for
this
beer
body
is
short
of
medium
and
this
is
a
total
summer
refresher
as
the
additives
are
subtle
and
so
the
whole
profile
is
akin
to
a
hot
weather
drink
rose
water
or
limeade
or
something
overall
a
real
well
done
brew
but
they
all
are
from
dieu
ciel
overall
an
interesting
beer
the
spices
are
nice
but
a
little
harsh
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
sipper
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
eventually
calms
to
a
light
foaminess
25
and
general
smoothness
35
could
use
a
bit
more
consistent
carbonation
without
the
fizziness
closes
dry
with
very
light
stickiness
on
the
palate
owill
buy
again
id
love
to
have
this
on
draft
or
have
a
growler
the
color
alone
will
intrigue
you
and
the
smell
will
have
you
nosing
the
glass
down
to
the
last
drop
this
brew
smells
like
a
perfumed
lovely
woman
whos
been
drinking
ha
o
it
was
a
good
beer
overall
and
an
interesting
venture
into
gruit
ales
although
i
didnt
find
it
that
much
of
a
stark
contrast
to
a
typical
beer
of
the
same
style
without
gruit
it
was
interesing
creativity
that
paid
off
it
is
perfectly
balanced
between
all
ingredients
very
refreshing
and
harmonic
which
is
hard
to
accomplish
on
daring
experiments
orather
floral
beer
that
somehow
kept
its
balance
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
other
ddc
beers
though
very
refreshing
with
many
subtleties
if
easier
to
obtain
i
would
consider
making
it
a
part
of
my
regular
springsummer
repertoire
and
i
bet
this
would
be
great
as
the
base
for
a
beer
sangria
not
that
ive
ever
made
one
highly
recommended
someone
who
likes
these
dominant
flavors
would
like
this
beer
unfortunately
i
now
know
i
dont
like
hibiscus
a
refreshing
beer
an
exercise
in
restraint
building
a
delicate
but
complex
ale
it
is
well
thought
out
and
i
am
certainly
glad
we
picked
it
up
atmosphere
is
decent
fair
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
light
and
grainy
with
some
floral
and
citrus
bready
with
some
sweet
orange
and
bitter
orange
rind
and
just
a
bit
of
a
woody
character
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
pink
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
i
get
the
wheat
i
also
get
some
spices
and
some
floral
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
for
the
most
part
i
get
those
spices
as
well
as
some
fruitiness
not
bad
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overally
pretty
good
i
have
not
been
very
fond
of
this
beer
on
a
couple
of
previous
occasions
when
trying
it
but
enjoyed
it
much
more
this
time
for
whatever
reason
o
great
drinkability
another
dieu
du
ciel
masterpiece
very
unique
beer
drinkability
this
is
one
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
one
that
ill
be
coming
back
to
as
well
i
like
this
beer
i
think
it
may
be
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
takes
on
a
belgian
wit
that
ive
had
for
me
its
up
there
with
southampton
double
whitei
got
elements
of
german
hefe
and
belgian
wit
in
that
one
but
really
the
first
beer
that
has
had
a
major
impression
on
me
in
quite
a
while
something
different
and
quite
delicious
get
outside
the
box
and
try
this
youll
be
glad
you
did
glad
this
beer
was
on
the
list
but
it
isnt
really
taking
me
back
to
those
enchiladas
jeremy
and
petulia
were
there
that
nighti
wonder
if
they
remember
i
doubt
it
that
was
a
long
time
ago
cool
label
on
this
one
though
if
you
have
access
to
this
grab
a
single
bottle
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
cheers
overall
quite
a
refreshing
and
interesting
beer
the
hibiscus
is
definitely
present
however
in
no
way
does
it
overpower
a
really
good
balance
between
the
slight
sweetness
berry
tartness
and
herbal
bitterness
brings
this
beer
to
a
higher
score
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
smooth
as
this
style
of
beer
goes
this
was
quite
well
done
would
recommend
for
fans
of
herbedspice
brews
d
a
well
done
interesting
brew
nicely
sessionable
and
very
refreshing
would
pair
well
with
light
picnic
fare
light
with
champagne
like
carbonation
lots
of
initial
wine
like
sweetness
hibiscus
comes
through
nicely
and
dries
the
finish
a
bit
a
really
nice
summer
or
morning
beer
a
little
tiny
tasting
and
slightly
medicinal
but
overall
i
like
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
odifferent
refreshing
and
somewhat
exciting
a
beer
that
makes
you
pine
for
warmer
days
but
is
completely
enjoyable
in
any
setting
ddc
manages
to
pull
off
the
trick
of
subtle
complexity
with
this
beer
nothing
overwhelms
the
palate
but
there
is
a
lot
to
enjoy
here
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
these
guys
at
this
point
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
intense
but
the
underlying
floral
quality
is
there
with
a
slightly
bitter
herbal
flavor
very
drinkable
and
would
be
pleasant
in
the
summer
light
bodied
mouthfeel
and
altogether
ejyable
unique
but
not
overly
remarkable

for
me
rosee

with
tremendous
finesse
and
balance
with
undeniable
girly
overtones
she
seduces
the
palate
with
complexity
and
smooth
textures
and
make
you
gleeful
in
the
oversight
of
her
flaws
overall
first
time
having
the
style
and
pleasantly
surprised
really
enjoy
the
heavy
peach
taste
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
by
dieu
du
ciel
o
it
is
surprisingly
refreshing
it
is
a
great
beer
to
follow
a
day
of
yard
work
i
could
easily
have
another
but
the
price
i
paid
for
it
makes
it
a
little
cost
prohibitive
d
ive
tried
this
beer
twice
now
and
while
this
wasnt
the
outright
disaster
it
was
last
time
i
fail
to
see
whatever
anyone
else
sees
in
this
a
mediocre
profile
of
skunky
grains
and
vegetal
floral
notes
gross
o
this
is
so
so
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
even
better
than
it
was
when
i
first
took
my
sip
either
that
or
im
better
now
i
know
that
this
beer
that
sits
odd
in
its
complexity
is
really
well
balanced
sweet
faintly
bitter
and
slightly
acidicsour
delicious
bright
pinkorange
color
with
a
very
active
carbonation
the
small
head
has
a
poor

the
smell
is
floral
hibiscus
well
recognizable
and
citusy
taste
is
mineral
rather
acid
it
gives
a
rustic
character
mediumbodied
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
has
an
excellent
well
thoughtout
this
is
a
good
drink
for
a
warm
summer
day
solid
brew
o
very
light
and
refreshing
similar
to
a
hoegarden
with
some
floral
notes
definitely
sesisonable
and
one
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
great
beer
for
warm
summer
evenings
a
refreshing
afternoon
beer
well
suited
on
its
own
or
with
food
pretty
complex
beer
with
a
wine
fruit
and
beer
interface
while
complex
it
is
pretty
light
bodied
and
refreshing
not
a
very
common
thing
have
had
this
beer
many
times
killing
time
waiting
for
the
wife
to
get
home
and
this
six
pack
was
bought
for
her
guess
she
gets
five
or
less
of
them
the
best
word
i
have
heard
to
describe
this
beer
patiolicious
this
beer
walks
the
fine
line
between
a
dry
french
rosee
wine
and
beer
with
a
mouth
dry
quality
that
just
makes
this
beer
disappear
oh
look
at
that
the
glass
is
empty
o
i
quite
like
the
hibiscus
very
interesting
and
drinkable
definitely
recommended
o
immensely
drinkable
most
appealing
and
a
wonderfully
executed
fruit
beer
interesting
and
excellent
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
despite
the
high
price
tag
another
great
beer
from
a
superlative
brewery
really
not
bad
it
is
just
a
bit
lacking
and
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
it
i
know
that
is
pretty
generic
but
something
is
missing
for
me
to
love
this
i
have
more
bottles
that
i
will
certainly
finish
and
maybe
it
will
grow
on
me
some
more
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
give
it
solid
5s
but
the
appearance
is
the
only
thing
that
really
takes
away
from
it
also
because
the
beer
says
hibiscus
i
would
have
loved
to
taste
it
in
the
beer
but
i
dont
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
and
recommend
it
to
others
it
is
a
very
great
beer
o
i
like
it
but
its
one
of
those
things
where
i
can
only
have
one
and
then
search
for
something
else
to
drink
o
a
very
easy
drinker
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
definitely
not
a
girlie
beer
i
enjoyed
the
use
of
ingredients
and
the
fact
that
nothing
is
overpowering
very
well
balanced
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
a
pretty
cool
herbedspiced
beer
it
has
a
delicate
but
complex
nature
to
it
that
really
defies
categorization
i
could
certainly
drink
more
than
one
particularly
on
a
warmer
day
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
brunch
to
replace
your
typical
sparkling
beverages
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
a
beer
that
was
a
little
more
floral
than
what
was
offered
sure
there
is
some
of
that
on
the
palate
but
it
is
not
as
dominant
as
say
the
belgian
note
or
the
citrus
feel
i
fully
expected
not
to
like
this
much
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
overall
3
i
usually
like
spiced
beers
but
the
perfumy
estery
scents
flavours
of
this
beer
were
not
easily
drinkable
despite
the
noncomplex
character
of
the
mouthfeel
a
wellcrafted
herbspice
beer
that
wins
and
loses
some
points
for
being
a
little
unique
and
different
good
for
a
oneoff
try
but
likely
not
something
i
will
return
to
o
this
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
from
the
initial
pour
you
know
you
are
in
for
something
different
i
may
purchase
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
but
overall
it
was
just
slightly
above
average
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
o
4
t
very
light
and
floral
flavor
rosewater
a
slight
bit
of
floral
hops
some
pale
malt
and
a
bit
of
lemon
clean
finish
a
really
nice
refreshing
beer
o
quite
a
good
and
refreshing
herbedspiced
wheat
beer
i
especially
like
the
rich
and
fuller
body
slant
dieu
du
ciel
took
with
this
particular
style
this
is
something
ill
be
drinking
again
but
worth
trying
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
a
unique
blend
of
flavors
well
balanced
d
very
drinkable
the
floral
elements
are
really
at
the
perfect
level
here
for
the
style
and
work
so
well
with
the
fruit
flavor
and
the
wheat
base
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
balance
definitely
a
floral
hibiscus
flavor
with
a
background
of
some
lagerish
malt
and
a
tad
of
lemon
zest
and
bittering
hops
ive
been
really
impressed
with
this
brewery
so
far
and
this
beer
didnt
let
me
down
id
certainly
try
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
those
who
can
get
it
o
a
really
strange
beer
but
not
all
that
bad
people
looking
to
try
something
out
of
the
ordinary
and
especially
those
into
herbedspiced
beers
should
check
this
out
it
wont
be
for
everybody
and
it
certainly
wont
be
for
many
occasions
but
its
a
worthy
beer
to
be
sure
poured
a
1
5
pinkhued
head
interesting
hazy
pink
tinge
to
the
body
kind
of
like
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
smells
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
shows
the
spices
has
a
floral
aspect
though
i
dont
know
hibiscus
well
enough
to
place
it
and
kind
of
an
herbal
tea
aspect
in
the
finish
its
a
pretty
beer
a
good
beer
but
in
a
completely
blind
taste
test
im
not
sure
it
would
stand
out
dramatically
from
the
other
spiced
citrusy
beers
93
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unique
and
refreshing
beer
i
became
acclimated
to
the
hibiscus
flavor
over
time
but
it
is
still
a
very
nice
wheat
o
i
went
to
ddc
for
the
bigger
beers
but
this
one
really
surprised
me
very
refreshing
and
never
is
it
too
flowery
or
does
it
taste
forced
or
artificial
definitely
worth
trying
this
beer
was
one
that
i
couldnt
remember
if
i
had
tried
it
in
the
past
or
not
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
and
see
if
i
remembered
it
turns
out
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
characteristics
the
pour
from
what
i
could
tell
in
the
dark
bar
that
i
was
in
looked
reddish
pink
in
the
dim
lighting
they
had
the
head
was
foamy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
herbal
and
floral
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
along
those
same
lines
it
had
plenty
of
herbal
notes
and
some
citrus
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
good
i
thought
o
a
pretty
good
beer
with
the
high
points
coming
in
through
the
smell
and
taste
really
wish
the
mouth
would
have
been
more
of
a
performer
as
i
think
the
flavors
could
have
used
a
bit
of
an
effervescent
boost
i
liked
some
of
the
light
flavor
contrast
from
some
mild
funk
and
green
stems
there
a
reasonable
amount
of
complexity
here
even
with
a
fairly
weak
mouth
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
how
much
better
this
would
be
with
some
real
fizz
a
good
beer
that
isnt
hard
to
get
down
but
it
could
have
improved
every
category
with
an
uplifting
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
surprising
beer
and
thankfully
does
not
taste
just
like
roseswhich
i
was
half
expecting
it
to
the
sourness
instead
brings
a
remarkable
freshness
to
the
brew
changing
it
from
a
sweet
nothing
to
a
decentquality
wheat
beer
it
may
not
win
awards
but
its
worth
trying
overall
this
is
just
what
i
need
on
this
warm
summer
afternoon
easy
drinker
and
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
very
refreshing
ale
nothing
exceptional
about
it
it
is
fairly
two
dimensional
kind
of
disappointed
the
wheat
is
not
apparent
nor
are
the
hops
in
any
way
definitely
worth
a
try
dr
very
refreshing
a
great
hot
day
quencher
now
if
only
it
wasnt
5
a
bottle
i
intend
to
pick
up
some
bottles
of
this
the
next
time
im
in
the
store
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
deep
rose
wine
color
with
a
very
thin
almost
non
existent
pink
colored
head
atop
aromas
had
a
lactic
tinge
to
them
to
go
along
with
some
floral
and
toasted
wheat
notes
light
to
medium
feel
with
light
carbonation
flavors
are
toasted
with
lacticlike
sourness
in
the
backend
wich
isnt
a
bad
things
little
floral
component
in
there
as
well
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
normally
buy
but
its
great
for
sitting
outside
while
grilling
some
jerk
chicken
over
the
coals
mouthfeel
smooth
but
the
sourness
lingers
a
bit
do
i
have
a
bad
bottle
nevertheless
i
probably
wont
revisit
not
very
appealing
o
this
was
interesting
glad
i
tried
it
didnt
love
it
but
liked
it
unlike
any
other
sour
if
i
can
even
call
it
that
ive
tasted
not
sweet
at
all
which
is
a
good
thing
but
not
that
sour
either
perplexing
overall
very
pleasntly
surprised
i
was
expecting
something
overly
sweet
or
artificial
love
the
balance
between
floral
and
sour
definitly
will
seek
out
again
this
will
be
great
for
the
beach
hazy
deep
pink
colour
minimal
white
head
no
retention
and
no
lace
smell
is
spicy
touches
of
yeast
very
floral
orange
zest
and
other
notes
of
citrus
are
present
taste
is
of
spice
and
cove
orange
floral
notes
present
throughout
tart
finish
a
light
acidity
wheat
and
citrus
battle
it
out
in
the
finish
medium
body
medium
carbonation
good
feel
delicious
stuff
complex
very
different
and
refreshing
no
offflavors
but
the
fruityflowery
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
refreshing
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
another
one
masks
its
abv
well
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
uncommon
traits
for
a
fruit
or
an
herbed
beer
this
is
a
wonderfully
floral
ale
that
should
be
tried
overall
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sit
out
on
a
patio
on
a
nice
hot
summer
evening
and
have
a
couple
of
these
as
i
already
said
in
my
review
this
beer
looks
so
cool
ive
actually
never
really
seen
a
pink
beer
before
the
smells
are
that
of
a
typical
wheat
beer
and
the
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
vodka
cooler
at
first
then
the
citrusy
fruits
and
spicy
notes
come
back
which
remind
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
all
in
all
a
great
brew
here
from
dieu
du
ciel
a
definite
summer
one
for
me
and
i
cant
wait
to
be
drinking
these
on
my
patio
this
summer
personally
i
liked
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
midas
touch
but
with
a
funky
finish
refreshing
to
boot
o
not
the
best
floral
beer
ive
ever
had
but
the
girlfriend
will
probably
like
it
overall
this
is
a
pleasantly
refreshing
brew
if
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
it
would
make
for
some
fine
decksipping
this
summer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
glass
but
i
wont
be
tracking
down
every
bottle
in
california
especially
at
5
dollars
a
bottle
worth
a
try
if
only
to
inspire
the
homebrewers
among
us
to
take
this
concept
and
run
with
it
o
glad
i
tried
this
interesting
beer
however
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
for
the
price
only
grabbed
it
because
i
rarely
see
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
at
the
lcbo
and
they
were
out
of
the
weheistephaner
hefeweisse
damn
i
went
to
buy
pours
a
hazy
clear
redpinkish
color
with
a
tiny
12
light
red
cap
that
becomes
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
on
the
glass
that
dissipate
and
slide
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
smell
is
of
a
light
witbier
with
red
berries
hibiscus
flowers
and
some
slight
spices
taste
is
of
sweet
red
berries
hibiscus
cranberry
with
a
traditional
witbier
aftertaste
good
carbonation
with
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
an
interesting
fruityfloral
beer
that
is
pretty
refreshing
overall
certainly
different
and
its
easy
to
drink
while
good
it
doesnt
really
grab
me
this
would
be
good
with
a
sunny
day
rather
than
the
down
pour
were
getting
vi
concluding
thoughts
i
need
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
this
had
to
be
an
old
bottle
i
will
rereview
as
soon
as
i
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
mmm
i
was
afraid
the
age
would
not
be
kind
to
this
one
but
it
seems
to
have
survived
the
long
hibernation
very
well
still
tastes
crisp
and
fresh
the
beer
almost
tastes
like
sweet
flower
petals
very
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
vinous
aspect
comes
forth
with
a
tart
tannic
character
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
well
worth
the
rather
steep
price
tag
that
most
of
the
ddc
bottles
seem
to
carry
i
bet
this
would
be
very
good
on
tap
as
well
drink
just
too
thin
and
light
for
me
to
get
passed
the
lightness
of
the
watery
levels
was
a
bit
different
which
i
liked
but
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
pretty
good
overall
here
not
sure
i
can
compare
much
for
this
style
i
think
the
thing
that
impresses
me
the
most
is
the
beers
appearance
to
say
the
least
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
from
connecticut
avenue
wine
and
liquors
what
a
great
beer
to
be
clear
though
its
not
a
great
beer
because
of
some
quirky
eyebrowraising
infusion
of
hibiscus
that
light
floral
taste
is
there
but
this
beer
isnt
the
festina
peche
of
the
hibiscus
instead
the
flower
is
used
more
in
the
way
that
bfm
uses
tea
its
really
light
and
you
have
to
be
pretty
feeling
pretty
keen
to
find
it
and
after
tasting
it
used
in
this
way
its
just
how
i
want
it
medium
carbonation
rosy
color
and
a
little
bit
of
body
with
refreshing
floralgrapefruit
notes
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
out
of
a
tap
d
i
like
when
brewers
take
a
chance
and
this
is
a
definite
chance
that
pays
off
for
the
most
part
the
overall
flavour
is
of
tomato
in
my
opinion
i
dont
see
anybody
drinking
this
on
the
regular
but
it
is
a
nice
change
up
now
and
then
d
this
is
very
drinkable
theres
a
bitterness
that
makes
me
think
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
chew
on
a
flower
petal
but
its
not
a
strong
bitterness
this
has
a
very
nice
aroma
to
it
but
the
flavors
while
well
balanced
are
very
subdued
overall
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
sitting
on
a
gazebo
on
a
summer
day
its
light
and
tart
enough
to
be
refreshing
especially
when
cold
yet
interesting
and
incredibly
unique
i
ran
a
dieu
du
ciel
tasting
today
at
my
stores
beer
department
and
this
was
the
first
beer
i
used
to
reel
people
in
especially
a
few
ladies
not
used
to
craft
beer
this
beers
uniqueness
really
makes
me
wonder
why
more
people
dont
experiment
with
floral
beers
id
really
like
to
try
a
saison
brewed
with
lavender
or
something
maybe
someone
could
do
an
ipa
with
poppies
haha
there
are
lots
of
possibilities
a
warming
belgian
on
a
cold
winter
day
generally
hits
the
spot
but
this
one
was
lacking
and
did
more
hitting
the
wallet
than
anything
else
i
enjoyed
it
accompanying
my
meal
but
i
definitely
skipped
out
on
dessert
i
still
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
but
ill
be
more
likely
to
discriminate
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
id
recommend
trying
this
if
you
enjoy
wheat
beers
with
creative
spices
the
taste
is
big
on
spice
and
the
white
wine
character
is
still
there
coriander
plays
a
big
role
and
some
additive
maybe
the
flowers
come
off
as
bitter
surprisingly
full
bodied
and
could
be
a
bit
more
crisp
in
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
department
that
being
said
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
d
i
found
this
beer
fairly
undrinkable
the
partner
with
whom
i
was
sharing
the
beer
actually
ended
up
dumping
it
because
of
how
much
she
disliked
it
good
mouthfeel
good
and
interesting
coloring
but
the
flavor
is
perfumelike
and
unbalanced
i
would
never
seek
this
beer
out
and
frankly
i
would
not
accept
it
if
someone
tried
to
give
me
one
overall
impression
tart
sour
and
sweet
this
herb
beer
is
interesting
and
unique
not
worth
a
second
try
drinkability
interesting
and
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
i
would
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
d
really
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
summer
brew
taste
is
pretty
much
what
the
label
describes
had
a
nice
sourness
to
it
though
not
much
carbonation
it
was
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
deep
rosy
light
red
pink
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
whiteyellow
head
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
lacing
smells
of
flowers
wheat
and
maybe
some
citrus
tastes
of
the
hibiscus
flower
some
malts
orange
and
some
sourness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
lively
drinkability
is
fairly
high
drinkability
not
sure
interesting
brew
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
drinkability
not
my
type
of
beer
happy
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
not
something
i
would
go
after
drinkability
was
actually
easy
but
the
flavor
isnt
making
me
want
another
its
fine
for
what
it
is
almost
like
a
champagne
beer
i
could
see
it
having
its
time
and
place
maybe
for
people
who
are
trying
to
slowly
make
the
cross
from
fizzy
fruity
drinks
into
the
beer
world
pours
a
clear
redcopper
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
citrus
sweet
malt
slight
tart
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
grass
floral
aroma
and
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
herbed
spiced
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
tang
to
the
feel
tastes
of
slight
tart
malt
slight
citrus
orange
slight
hop
slight
wood
floral
spice
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
lacing
in
appearance
but
great
aroma
blend
body
and
complexity
d
superb
flavours
and
appearnce
makes
this
one
a
huge
wow
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
and
it
shocked
all
of
us
just
how
nice
this
beer
was
definately
need
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
d
the
only
way
i
can
imagine
drinking
this
is
by
the
pitcher
sitting
at
a
pool
on
vacation
in
france
very
drinkable
a
beer
your
grandmother
would
like
but
not
too
exciting
and
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
and
has
some
thirstquenching
properties
dm
light
bodied
but
crisp
it
has
a
punch
like
quality
but
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
once
in
a
while
d
quite
high
drinkability
nothing
wrong
with
this
at
all
nice
low
abv
and
a
completely
different
flavour
could
mean
good
sessions
if
youre
into
this
drinkability
is
outstanding
very
quaffable
bodegas
menu
said
this
was
9
but
the
website
must
be
correct
because
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
i
could
potentially
drink
all
night
however
the
flavor
is
so
delicate
that
i
would
soon
be
craving
something
with
some
more
umph
to
it
d
sorry
never
having
this
one
again
i
was
disappointed
when
after
1
sip
my
wife
said
no
and
passed
it
to
me
to
drink
overall
im
somewhat
impressed
more
so
than
i
thought
this
was
my
second
bottle
and
i
didnt
remember
liking
it
as
much
as
the
first
time
i
can
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
on
the
deck
in
the
summer
delicious
overall
its
a
novelty
beer
its
not
something
i
will
reach
for
again
and
again
however
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
as
it
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
hibiscus
the
spices
and
the
hops
just
ultimately
not
my
cup
of
tea
peachy
opaque
body
nice
crisp
white
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
hibiscus
peach
very
fruity
and
floral
excellent
mouthfeel
very
nice
amount
of
carbonation
flowers
peach
mango
on
the
tongue
extremely
refreshing
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
or
three
at
a
time
nice
with
a
bowl
of
kush
drink
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
beer
like
this
before
points
for
originality
and
it
actually
tastes
pretty
good
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
a
very
refreshing
twist
on
wheat
ales
to
hell
with
lemons
well
take
our
wheat
with
hibiscus
any
day
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
herbed
and
spiced
beer
i
will
review
this
with
the
knowledge
that
this
is
not
my
kind
of
beer
and
rate
accordingly
first
of
all
this
looks
a
bit
like
a
well
stocked
sangria
colour
this
makes
sense
since
it
is
a
hibiscus
beer
the
foam
is
thin
and
like
a
typical
big
industry
ricecorn
lager
the
scent
also
makes
me
think
of
fruit
punchsangria
which
is
fine
there
is
nothing
cloying
here
which
is
what
i
would
be
wary
of
this
does
taste
like
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
foundation
with
some
sweetness
and
a
vigorous
fruit
flavour
that
being
said
it
is
very
palatable
even
though
it
would
not
be
my
choice
of
a
beer
in
short
if
you
want
a
quality
hibiscus
beer
this
is
likely
among
the
best
you
will
find
i
can
see
drinking
this
at
a
party
on
a
balcony
in
the
hot
humid
summer
poured
a
really
weird
hazy
blood
red
with
very
little
head
spicy
floral
and
kind
of
strange
but
light
and
pleasant
fairly
acidic
it
grew
on
me
from
beginning
to
end
the
spiciness
is
strange
at
first
but
seems
to
come
into
its
own
tending
toward
a
saison
more
than
any
style
medium
bodied
this
is
a
little
chewier
than
i
expected
but
its
lively
carbonation
keeps
it
feeling
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
definitely
not
my
favourite
ddc
offering
but
still
worth
a
try
quite
interesting
d
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
wouldnt
be
hard
to
have
a
couple
of
these
if
it
was
more
readily
available
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
lacking
but
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
i
have
to
admit
when
my
wife
picked
this
out
i
thought
it
would
be
an
interesting
beer
to
try
once
but
i
think
the
only
thing
deterring
me
from
having
this
again
would
possibly
be
the
price
tag
d
quite
refreshing
and
fairly
easytodrink
as
the
spices
and
fruitiness
dont
overwhelm
at
all
a
curiously
interesting
herbal
wheat
beer
poured
a
hazy
light
cranberry
color
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
seen
up
front
a
bit
of
wheaty
tartness
with
vague
fruitpunch
floral
notes
following
mouthfeel
was
full
but
not
chewy
and
finish
was
clean
with
some
lingering
citric
acid
notes
i
found
the
beer
to
be
very
engaging
and
pleasant
to
drink
d
easy
to
down
for
5
9
and
adequately
thirstquenching
brought
a
new
taste
to
the
table
and
i
may
try
it
again
i
like
its
originality
but
didnt
feel
that
it
stayed
within
what
i
consider
to
be
a
good
beer
d
mild
enough
to
be
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
who
knew
flowers
could
play
a
major
role
in
making
a
beer
great
dieu
du
ciel
has
worked
a
wonder
with
this
beer
kudos
for
trying
something
different
this
one
is
for
the
openminded
but
thankfully
its
really
quite
palatable
more
like
soft
drink
or
fruit
juice
than
beer
but
enjoyable
in
its
way
for
the
record
i
had
an
argument
with
another
guy
at
the
spectapular
about
whether
this
was
really
beer
i
said
that
weve
accepted
things
like
orange
and
coriander
spiced
witbiers
so
why
not
this
i
believe
this
is
much
of
the
same
ilk
that
the
combination
of
flavours
works
as
a
beer
and
much
different
from
some
other
sugary
fruitorspice
infused
beers
interesting
beer
poured
a
ton
of
head
and
held
rentention
fairly
well
well
balanced
herb
and
flower
taste
the
nose
was
loaded
with
earthy
aromas
i
really
didnt
expect
mush
from
this
but
it
was
a
well
made
beer
and
a
good
use
of
a
different
item
like
hibiscus
used
i
would
try
this
again
it
was
a
great
beer
d
drain
pour
i
love
wheat
beers
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
it
definitely
has
to
be
an
acquired
taste
d
another
one
of
those
unique
beers
fruity
but
a
very
natural
flavour
lightbodied
a
summer
brew
for
sure
across
the
board
likeable
d
fun
to
try
one
showcase
floral
aromas
and
tastes
flavors
of
subtle
spice
mild
cranberrycitrus
tartness
d
very
interesting
beer
with
different
set
of
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
beer
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
thanks
pino
for
the
throw
in
interesting
but
not
interesting
enough
to
want
to
chase
down
another
hv
mouthfeel
is
full
fresh
bracing
and
it
is
seriously
sessionable
and
drinkable
id
liek
to
fill
the
summer
beach
cooler
with
them
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
ruby
color
with
a
thin
white
that
quickly
fades
away
and
leaves
no
lacing
floral
aroma
with
spices
and
grapefruit
sweet
taste
that
is
fruity
spicy
and
a
little
sour
light
body
and
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
buy
again
d
definitely
unique
and
perfect
for
someone
whos
looking
for
a
oneofakind
experience
had
a
difficult
time
identifying
the
complex
flavours
but
made
for
a
very
memorable
experience
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
well
carbonated
this
complements
well
the
delicate
flavours
drinkability
is
very
high
light
and
refreshing
this
beer
seems
designed
for
hot
summers
i
drank
two
of
these
after
a
hot
cycle
i
would
have
drunk
a
third
if
i
had
another
cold
i
bought
this
as
part
of
the
2010
sample
pack
thank
god
i
can
get
this
in
sixes
as
well
because
i
will
be
trying
it
again
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
will
be
drinking
it
again
as
far
as
fruitspiced
beers
go
rosée
dhibiscus
is
perhaps
in
a
category
of
its
own
there
are
few
beers
so
vividly
pleasantly
and
authentically
flavoured
the
spicing
as
well
enhances
the
beers
dimension
and
makes
for
a
beverage
so
unique
and
flavourful
and
social
and
refreshing
that
its
a
threat
to
lemonades
and
iced
teas
and
sangrias
everywhere
thanks
to
sliverx
from
the
stanley
cup
bif
for
this
very
refreshing
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
nonetheless
well
done
for
bringing
new
flavours
to
my
palette
341ml
bottle
from
the
lcbo
part
of
the
summer
2010
beer
release
pours
a
hazy
and
opaque
pinkish
rose
with
no
head
or
lace
aside
from
the
unique
colour
this
beer
looks
boring
smell
is
sweet
malt
herbs
liquor
and
flowers
taste
is
tangy
salty
and
mildly
sour
fruit
floral
leafy
and
herbaceous
hops
some
spiciness
on
the
palate
and
a
dryly
parched
finish
no
wheat
to
speak
of
mouth
feel
is
very
tart
and
astringent
pushing
toward
cloying
with
a
weird
and
soapy
saltiness
in
the
aftertaste
yuck
perhaps
hibiscus
will
appeal
to
the
antihop
palates
of
mainstream
ontarians
who
dont
actually
enjoy
craft
beer
as
for
me
i
find
this
to
be
an
undrinkable
puckering
fruit
ale
not
worthy
of
attention
deep
saturated
rose
pink
in
colour
extremely
cloudy
and
turbid
a
thin
light
pink
head
forms
as
i
pour
it
then
disappears
right
away
no
lace
that
hazy
pink
colour
looks
amazing
it
smells
of
flowers
peaches
and
fruit
punch
very
aromatic
yet
simple
at
the
same
time
tastes
fruity
floral
and
mildly
tart
with
some
coriander
and
pepper
berries
not
any
particular
kind
of
berries
but
just
berrylike
light
in
body
but
not
thin
soft
carbonation
and
lots
of
particulate
in
suspension
help
it
feel
a
bit
smooth
and
creamy
tangy
and
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
flavoured
wheat
beer
having
more
in
common
with
a
witbier
than
with
fruited
american
wheats
d
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
wouldnt
be
hard
to
have
a
couple
of
these
if
it
was
more
readily
available
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
lacking
but
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
it
is
moderately
interesting
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
tart
beers
part
way
through
and
i
am
ready
for
a
switch
d
a
very
unique
beer
that
was
interesting
to
try
but
not
one
that
i
would
purchase
again
not
enough
to
keep
my
coming
back
but
sure
to
please
some
in
the
group
a
reasonably
tasty
brew
but
there
is
something
going
on
which
means
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
soon
good
but
not
great
d
very
good
beer
that
had
an
intresting
nose
and
taste
pretty
good
well
rounded
offering
from
the
canadians
i
hope
they
brew
more
stuff
like
this
pours
a
murky
bright
red
colour
with
small
pink
head
head
dissipates
quickly
without
lacing
i
get
a
ton
of
fruit
in
the
smell
with
strawberries
and
banana
i
get
some
floral
smell
too
which
i
suppose
is
the
hibiscus
flowers
that
they
say
are
in
this
though
i
dont
know
what
hibiscus
smells
like
for
comparison
taste
doesnt
have
much
of
the
wheat
that
i
expected
but
still
pleasant
lots
of
spices
and
fruit
perfect
for
a
warm
day
on
a
patio
wouldnt
be
my
drink
of
choice
most
days
though
d
its
quite
refreshing
but
i
think
the
thin
feel
and
the
novelty
will
wear
off
after
one
bottle
this
beer
tastes
like
the
name
i
nice
refreshing
summer
concoction
with
a
whole
lot
of
hibiscus
it
fills
your
nose
and
mouth
with
a
cool
and
flowery
character
that
is
very
delicate
yet
pronounced
at
the
same
time
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
totally
unique
and
reminds
me
of
rose
water
theres
a
lot
of
iced
tea
flavors
going
on
here
complete
with
some
tannic
qualities
on
the
end
theres
a
bit
of
peach
and
citrusy
sourness
very
interesting
and
im
sure
if
youre
into
this
kind
of
beer
youd
easily
become
obsessed
with
this
one
im
dissapointed
in
this
one
however
this
is
not
the
first
time
ive
not
been
in
love
with
a
highly
regarded
beer
in
this
category
fantastic
summer
patio
witbier
i
normally
am
not
partial
to
these
fruit
infused
wheats
but
this
is
just
so
unique
and
well
crafted
flavorful
refreshing
and
quenching
you
have
to
love
it
another
fine
offering
from
canadas
premier
artisan
brewery
bottle
pours
a
hazy
ruby
pink
red
colour
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
using
the
dogfish
head
glass
the
taste
has
a
little
spice
to
it
with
a
lingering
yeasty
strawberry
background
some
floral
flower
notes
are
present
too
my
bottle
says
5
9
and
it
drinks
down
pretty
smooth
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
i
am
pleasently
suprised
i
would
consider
this
again
pours
a
hazy
plum
color
with
ruby
highlights
thin
whispy
head
diminishing
quicly
but
leaving
spotty
lacing
scent
is
very
floral
up
front
backed
by
notes
of
vanilla
honey
light
tastes
of
dark
fruit
fresh
baked
whole
grain
bread
the
floral
notes
are
again
the
star
rose
water
hibiscus
notes
of
vanilla
and
honey
compliment
these
notes
well
also
present
is
a
yeaty
and
grainy
fresh
baked
bread
charachter
and
touches
of
spice
along
with
very
light
tartness
and
funkyness
medium
bodied
somewhat
oily
with
a
touch
of
dryness
a
very
nice
unique
tasting
beer
the
second
floral
beer
in
a
few
weeks
for
me
and
would
welcome
more
in
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
at
my
new
favorite
restaurant
in
btown
the
farmhouse
this
beer
was
a
pinkorange
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
skim
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
delicious
blend
of
floral
and
fruit
elements
highlighted
by
the
hibiscus
almost
like
a
scented
candle
the
flavors
were
also
very
enjoyable
a
blend
of
strawberry
pomegranate
wheat
lychee
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
heat
sweet
and
floral
with
a
low
bitterness
refreshing
and
unique
the
mouthfeel
was
semismooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light
a
blush
beer
totally
worth
trying
and
a
great
summer
experience
light
red
in
color
like
a
kriek
in
more
ways
than
just
that
not
much
foam
but
very
drinkable
rose
is
detectable
and
the
fruit
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
but
very
refreshing
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
or
hops
flavors
goes
down
very
easily
unfortunately
if
youre
thirsty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
tart
and
acidic
with
a
cherry
pie
and
cooked
rhubarb
mouth
feel
is
very
carbonated
and
sour
drinkability
is
average
due
to
the
strong
sour
taste
overall
a
decent
drink
not
something
id
buy
often
but
i
dont
regret
getting
this
one
try
it
at
least
once
pours
a
cloudy
plum
color
with
a
small
light
pink
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
looks
like
it
is
made
with
fresh
berry
juice
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
belgian
wit
big
coriander
presence
has
that
post
farmers
market
rotting
vegatable
smell
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
that
is
what
a
wit
smells
like
to
me
some
light
fruit
sweetness
but
the
coriander
just
crushes
everything
the
taste
has
a
light
berry
sweetness
a
bit
tart
followed
by
a
floral
presence
from
the
hibiscus
of
course
there
is
the
coriander
but
it
is
thankfully
muted
by
the
other
flavors
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
has
a
lemon
edge
to
it
the
feel
is
light
with
spritzy
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
astringent
an
ok
brew
definitely
in
the
wit
style
could
use
some
more
berry
and
floral
flavor
and
some
ease
on
the
coriander
not
bad
certainly
good
for
what
it
is
not
something
ill
drink
too
often
but
worth
a
try
nevertheless
always
support
brewers
desire
for
experimentation
good
light
body
and
spritzy
carbonation
d
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
my
bottle
actually
states
that
this
brew
is
5
9
abv
but
has
exactly
the
same
label
anyway
this
brew
pours
a
deep
pink
roseguava
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
some
sporadic
lacingthe
aromas
are
very
typical
of
a
witbier
with
hints
of
corrianderorange
peelcuracao
and
tropical
fruit
punchit
has
an
average
lightish
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
wheatbarleycorrianderorange
peel
and
vanilla
which
finishes
a
little
sour
and
tartoverall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
interesting
to
try
but
dont
see
myself
getting
this
on
any
regular
basis
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
i
hope
not
got
this
on
a
recommendation
from
one
of
the
guys
at
the
local
beerwine
store
and
was
not
disappointed
cant
wait
for
summer
to
really
enjoy
it
in
the
sun
notes
nice
brew
although
more
than
inspired
by
belgium
wheat
brews
like
suggested
it
tingles
my
memory
more
so
of
a
berliner
weisse
maybe
the
tart
and
sour
notes
are
a
bit
more
subdued
here
but
it
has
a
common
general
feel
and
it
is
as
if
the
syrup
used
here
is
the
one
of
the
hibiscus
flower
with
a
nice
and
gentle
meld
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
as
floral
as
i
can
remember
a
beer
smelling
while
still
having
a
good
bit
else
going
on
well
worth
a
shot
this
was
a
very
interesting
offering
for
me
and
one
i
did
not
really
see
coming
very
solid
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
overall
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
not
sure
id
be
able
to
distinguish
it
from
fruit
jucie
if
you
set
both
in
front
of
me
the
taste
becomes
hard
to
bear
after
a
while
the
pour
reveals
a
light
cascade
of
cloudiness
though
somewhat
amberlike
in
appearance
a
rosy
haze
permeates
throughout
giving
an
overall
blood
orange
visual
the
nose
is
genuinely
inviting
the
hibiscus
aromas
asserting
themselves
just
enough
to
be
pleasing
to
the
nostrils
but
once
the
liquid
hits
the
tongue
it
is
clear
that
these
initial
bits
of
hope
are
ordained
to
remain
in
the
realm
of
what
could
have
been
the
taste
recalls
a
weak
wit
with
those
hibiscus
traces
trying
to
assert
themselves
once
again
alas
the
flowers
only
serve
to
give
the
beer
a
sort
of
whispy
grapefruit
quality
resulting
in
a
weakly
citrus
take
on
hoegaarden
this
weakness
is
exacerbated
by
the
weak
slightly
overcarbonated
body
that
effervesces
on
the
tongue
in
a
mildly
annoying
manner
something
akin
to
a
light
citrusy
ginger
ale
comes
to
mind
and
to
tongue
this
is
also
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
good
enough
to
allow
it
to
be
drunk
but
not
good
enough
to
elicit
too
heavy
a
desire
to
consistently
imbibe
it
allinall
a
soso
offering
but
one
with
a
good
deal
of
promise
my
first
thoughts
are
why
would
any
brewery
bottle
this
this
is
like
a
brewpub
oneoff
the
bottle
price
says
4
50someone
got
hornswaggled
pours
orangish
red
with
almost
no
head
no
lacing
either
and
it
almost
looks
flat
smell
is
subtle
but
is
a
nice
mix
of
spices
and
flowers
the
taste
is
like
a
mild
pale
ale
with
a
great
flower
tinge
it
tastes
delicate
mouthfeel
is
brought
down
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
because
of
the
light
nature
of
the
beer
and
the
subtlety
of
the
spicing
very
interesting
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
but
did
not
love
well
if
you
dont
mind
the
wretched
smell
and
taste
this
might
be
more
drinkable
i
think
this
one
is
going
down
the
sink
this
is
definetly
a
unique
beer
the
hibiscus
flower
gives
this
beer
a
unique
acidic
and
fruity
component
while
mingling
well
with
the
typical
belgian
wheatyness
well
worth
seeking
out
just
to
try
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
this
is
one
i
could
sip
on
all
summer
long
mouthfeel
dry
light
body
and
lots
of
carbonation
not
sure
this
is
a
perfect
brew
im
not
one
to
judge
since
i
dont
really
like
fruity
drinks
or
cocktails
but
this
seems
like
its
really
well
executed
considering
it
brings
out
the
hibiscus
character
so
well
try

it

on

its
genuine
and

nothing
artificial
about
this

its
downright
tasty
dieu

does

pours
a
hazy
pink
with
a
minimal
white
head
with
a
tint
of
pink
this
color
is
from
the
addition
of
hibiscus
petals
during
brewing
some
yeast
sediment
from
the
bottle
came
out
at
the
end
as
expected
from
a
bottleconditioned
wheat
beer
the
nose
has
a
distinct
sourcitrus
smell
with
hints
of
vinegar
tannin
green
apple
and
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
this
definitely
has
some
wheat
beer
qualities
with
the
citrus
being
a
large
presence
grass
and
green
apple
show
up
as
well
as
a
perfume
and
floral
quality
with
an
herbal
finish
that
hints
at
the
hibiscus
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
it
is
a
bit
experimental
and
not
something
you
would
expect
a
beer
to
be
but
i
think
it
is
successful
the
light
body
and
effervescent
carbonation
along
with
the
flavor
make
for
a
refreshing
light
and
very
tasty
beer
quite
nice
these
guys
regularly
hit
the
mark
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
very
nice
easy
pick
up
on
the
hibiscus
with
some

hop
a
hint
of

a

citrus
in
a
very
good
way
body
is
very
good
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
nice
super
easy
drinking
and
a
session
beer
for
sure
would
be
killer
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
the
tartness
would
be
very
refreshing
not
sure
its
everyones
cup
of
tea
certainly
not
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewer
but
still
a
well
crafted
spicedfruit
beer
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
the
idea
is
interesting
d
moderate
this
beer
is
good
but
is
a
bit
unusual
and
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
and
taking
a
long
spell
inbetween
this
and
my
next
one
still
really
cool
and
this
would
be
good
for
showing
others
what
a
beer
can
be
very
unique
points
for
originality
d
a
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
better
herbedspiced
beers
out
there
this
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
stinging
carbonation
a
nice
beer
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
drinkability
while
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
beer
as
a
summer
quaffer
with
a
difference
too
bad
it
is
the
end
of
november
now
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
i
think
anyone
who
wants
something
refreshing
different
and
tasty
will
enjoy
this
one
conclusion
definitely
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
that
being
said
its
probably
not
something
id
get
very
often
as
its
a
bit
esoteric
this
beer
finishes
very
nicely
it
is
cool
and
refreshing
with
the
spritzy
character
the
beer
has
and
a
nice
med
body
accompanied
by
that
citrus
twang
a
very
different
beer
than
the
usuals
and
really
worth
a
try
im
dont
like
this
beer
much
it
just
doesnt
have
any
redeeming
qualities
about
it
its
well
brewed
but
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
not
recommended
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
the
carbonation
may
be
on
the
high
end
but
it
is
complimented
well
by
the
hibiscus
unique
brilliant
maybe
its
me
but
i
just
really
like
this
brewery
i
like
their
artwork
on
their
bottles
because
it
makes
the
beer
more
than
a
beer
to
me
its
sort
of
a
self
interprative
concept
great
stuff
d
unusual
and
interesting
but
not
all
that
drinkable
the
floral
notes
are
different
but
everything
eventually
just
becomes
flat
and
cloying
i
split
this
bottle
with
a
couple
of
friends
which
worked
out
well
since
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
a
whole
one
to
myself
d
we
halffinished
a
12ounce
bottle
between
2
adults
i
let
the
remainder
go
flat
overnight
and
today
theres
hardly
any
flavor
in
the
remaining
offpink
liquid
more
like
very
watereddown
cheap
wine
rinse
or
similar
oddly
though
theres
a
lot
more
scent
and
nose
in
the
flat
fluid
remaining
than
any
sort
of
flavor
or
taste
drinkability
average
i
suppose
that
if
you
loved
the
flavor
then
youd
drink
it
again
and
again
not
me
though
very
good
a
very
interesting
and
unusual
flavor
bursting
with
sweet
fruit
herbalfloral
qualities
bring
complexity
the
style
of
herbedspiced
beer
is
always
unusual
however
i
enjoyed
this
novelty
beer
for
what
it
is
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
very
unique
in
my
experience
and
good
but
the
combination
of
its
strangeness
along
with
the
incredibly
high
price
makes
another
one
very
unlikely
this
poured
a
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
strange
floral
hops
assumed
hibiscus
and
maybe
some
rose
and
pears
and
applesauce
with
some
light
yeast
and
earthy
caramel
it
tasted
like
floral
hops
and
pear
and
white
grapes
with
some
light
honey
and
floury
yeast
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
definitely
a
unique
beer
i
had
never
really
had
hibiscus
flavoring
before
it
was
very
clean
tasting
and
seemed
light
at
first
but
grew
wearisome
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
was
kind
of
like
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
blush
wine
to
me
i
prefer
something
with
more
body
and
bite
not
bad
to
try
once
but
certainly
not
worth
buying
again
m
good
body
goes
down
extremely
smooth
i
could
easily
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
while
chilling
out
for
the
day
the
beer
pours
a
rose
color
with
a
12
pink
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
really
nice
wheat
and
hibiscus
flower
aroma
its
quite
fruity
with
some
excellent
yeast
esters
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
refreshing
flavor
that
rivals
raspberries
but
not
as
fruity
the
wheat
character
is
quite
noticeable
along
with
the
flowers
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thats
quite
unique
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
wow
what
an
interesting
beer
its
not
blow
your
hair
back
good
but
its
very
interesting
di
have
no
idea
what
a
hibiscus
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
if
it
tastes
like
this
beer
i
should
try
more
you
know
that
you
are
drinking
beer
but
the
floral
theme
is
front
and
center
i
wont
watch
a
hockey
game
with
the
guys
to
this
one
but
i
would
have
it
again
though
by
myself
a
generally
tasty
and
balanced
herbal
beer
the
kind
where
if
youre
drinking
this
then
theres
no
doubt
about
which
pint
on
the
table
belongs
to
you
i
kid
i
kid
but
i
must
admit
the
floral
character
is
subtle
enough
that
i
might
actually
be
able
to
stomach
more
than
one
of
these
pours
a
cloudy
orange
almost
pink
body
with
a
light
pink
2
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
with
no
cap
smell
is
raspberry
strawberry
and
roses
with
a
tripellike
sharpness
taste
is
raspberry
sour
apple
strawberry
with
a
wheat
finish
to
mellow
out
all
the
fruits
that
then
linger
in
a
more
subtle
manner
the
feel
is
watery
yet
still
creamy
with
a
nice
encompassing
finish
that
only
slightly
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
dry
category
the
spice
is
starting
to
get
to
me
after
a
bit
but
the
taste
is
good
enough
that
it
isnt
going
to
stop
me
from
enjoying
the
brew
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
a
nice
refresher

ive

the

if
i
could
get
this
on

for

it
could
make
for
a
nice
afternoon
session
during
the
summer
give
this
beer
a
try
if
for
nothing
more
than
curiosity
the
hibiscus
flower
really
does
add
two
very
interesting
elements
to
this
style
its
not
just
a
gimmick
with
the

hibiscus

though
dissipates

nothing
too
quickly
would
like
more
volume
nose
is
everything
mentioned
with
some
coriander
hibiscus
is
a
powerful
tangy
herb
here
its
very
well
balance
about
as
potent
as
the
orange
peel
no
heavy
tang
light
tart
with
all
that
said
i
imagine
its
somewhat
hard
to
make
a
tart
beer
with
a
thick
sensation
to
it
my
hat
is
off
to
dieu
du

for
doing
it
before
i
have
some
poor
experimentation
as
a
wit
its
good
solid
good
balance
solid
spiced
wheat
aftertaste
will
have
it
again
without
a
doubt
really
easy
drinking
and
interesting
this
is
one
exciting
beer
although
i
am
sure
geography
has
something
to
do
with
it
i
keep
thinking
that
the
smooth
melding
of
fruity
flavors
and
healthy
carbonation
reminds
me
of
some
unibroue
products
this
is
great
i
love
this
wholly
unique
i
think
quaint
distraction
this
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
afford
it
but
great
for
dessert
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
huge
slightly
pin

head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin

aroma

petals

a

and
slightly

nice

peel
grape
fruit
and
light
crisp
grapes
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
in
body
with
a
fizzy
and
aggressive
carbonation
this
isnt
bad
especially
if
you
like
wits
andor
fruit
beers
but
its
not
really
something
im
likely
to
come
back
to
worth
a
try
d
très
facile
à
boire
et
à
apprécier
encore
une

aussi
goûté

et
elle

goût

je
préfére
en

only
my
second
beer
from
dieu
du

but
im
becoming
a
fan
of
their
beers
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
definitely
like
the
hibiscus
addition
as
it
meshes
well
with
the
base
beer
i
will
admit
that
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
pull
any
particular
belgian
yeast
character
out
of
this
beer
so
in
that
sense
this
might
not
be
the
most
complex
beer
but
i
still
like
it
md
very
light
and
flavorful
very
flowery
what
makes
it
good
also
makes
it
not
that
drinkable
for
me
i
could
sit
down
on
my
deck
in
the
middle
of
summer
and
be
happy
with
a
few
but
its
not
an
everyday
drinking
beer
definitely
youll
either
love
it
or
hate
it
drinkability
like
sipping
a
cloud
d
this
beer
was
just
so
refreshing
it
leaves
no
harshness
at
all
and
is
a
subtle
balance
of
some
very
interesting
flavors
this
is
something
i
could
definately
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
to
wind
down
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
before
bed
this
is
certainly
an
original
beer
like
most
from
dieu
du
ciel
but
this
is
probably
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
frequently
interesting
nonetheless
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
at
about
4
a
bottle
i
will
never
buy
this
again
worth
a
shot
once

this

had

and
i
mean
floral
in
the
most
literal
sense
of
the
word
lots
of
aromatic

happening
in
this

this
beer
is
on

side
lots
of

tropical

going

its
well
carbonated
just
falls
flat
on
body
it
seems
to
airy
im
not
sure
what
to
compare
it
too
so
i
can
only
judge
this
beer
as
i
perceive
it
it
reminds
me
more
and
more
of
a
sparkling
rose
with
every
sip
its
not
terribly
drinkable
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
definitely
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
this
is
one
cool
beer
since
it
tastes
unlike
any
other
pours
a

has
a

the
taste
is
a
light
floral
cirtus
flavour
with
hops
on
the

wit
with
flowers
and
more

the
finish
is
soft
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
considering
the
floral
profile
tastes
like
sonething
from
jolly
pumpkin
drinkability
i
think
the
word
i
used
most
in
this
review
was
strange
and
its
appropriate
the
alcohol
was
low
spritzy
kick
overall
and
naturally
not

is

a
beer
that
literally
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
and
did
so
once
again
when
i
brought
it
home
and
had
it
months
later
with
a
friend
who
also
couldnt
help
but
smile
at
the
citrusy
hops
shimmer
of
pine
interwoven
with
woodsy
sunshiny
spruce
and
a
subtle
carbonation
hazy
burnt
gold
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
fades
to
a
lace
this
one
just
hit
it
on
the
nose
for
me
finishes
sweet
on
the
back
end
complex
ending
here
its
a
great
beer
for
fall
season
and
the
cool
nights
but
still
does
not
hit
the
juniper
notes
ive
still
looking
for
so
to
that
end
ill
still
drop
a
shot
of
gin
into
a
torpeda
ipa
for
full
effect
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
but
thins
a
little
at
the
end
of
every
sip
as
the
booze
sneaks
in
its
got
a
moderate
crispness
and
is
pretty
smooth
overall
a
woody
note
hovering
in
the
finish
is
good
until
a
little
whisper
of
astrincency
sneaks
in
o
not
bad
but
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
needs
more
juniper
found
it
very
similiar
to
belgian
golden
ales
but
also
had
the
bitterness
of
hops
added
to
it
refreshing
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
as
a
lover
of
juniper
and
gin
this
one
matches
some
ginlike
tastes
pretty
well
especially
in
the
finish
it
is
an
enjoyable
experience
and
ill
definitely
be
reaching
for
another
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
o
not
too
much
different
than
the
base
beer
but
still
good
you
really
only
get
the
barrels
at
the
very
front
of
the
taste
nice
to
try
but
once
is
enough
because
it
just
doesnt
differ
much
from
the
regular
by
this
in
a
more
literal
sense
i
mean
that
the
strong
aspects
of
the
mouthfeel
arent
concentrated
in
a
certain
part
of
the
mouth
little
sparks
of
action
seem
to
materialize
in
different
parts
of
the
mouth
albeit
not
so
aggresively
a
fun
beer
to
drink
for
this
reason
and
because
its
a
solid
beer
with
the
added
aspect
of
having
been
ginbarrelaged
o
really
a
quite
odd
beer
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
citrus
ipa
with
brett
the
juniper
berries
and
gin
barrels
provide
a
decent
flavor
but
its
just
decent
overall
an
enjoyable
specialty
variation
very
enjoyable
thankfully
the
flavor
seemed
to
have
a
tiny
bit
more
kick
than
the
aroma
with
light
herbal
hopping
gin
herbals
woody
pine
aspects
over
a
disturbingly
mild
base
beer
profile
in
the
case
of
the
flavor
my
criticism
is
that
it
seems
more
like
a
diluted
gin
than
a
ginaugmented
beer
if
i
were
to
pretend
that
this
was
my
own
homebrew
project
id
be
trying
to
find
a
way
to
amplify
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
base
by
about

and
the

drink
this
again
o
definitely
different
but
the
flavors
mix
well
with
one

and
they
arent
all
competing
for
attention
i
was
surprised
at
how
well
balanced

tame
the

was
some
of
these
flavors
can
be
very
strong

leave
it
to
a
beer
to
open
my
eyes
to
gin
i
wont
be
hopping
onto

any
time
soon
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
have
it
again
and
would
absolutely
consider
it
as
a
fun
component
of

this

a
really
really
good
beer
id
drink
this
all
the
time
its
so
damn
refreshing
give
this
a
chance
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
i
dig
that
the
barrel
aging
takes
the
juniper
pale
ale
to
another
level
more
so
than
the
whiskey
does
for
dead
guy
in
the
other
john
john
varietal
it
has
a
goldenyellow
relatively
opaque
appearance
surprisingly
for
a
spiced
beer
there
is
very
little
smell
with
only
a
faint
hint
of
juniper
and
hops
a
fairly
uncomplicated
pale
ale
with
a
mild
juniper
taste
that
gives
it
a
little
it
a
of
a
rough
feel
o
this
is
a
decent
barrelaged
pale
ale
but
there
is
something
missing
here
i
was
expecting
a
heavy
gin
flavor
but
did
not
get
it
at
all
a
good
effort
but
somewhat
lacking
in
my
book
o
a
cool
experiment
in
weird
flavors
due
to
the
juniper
berries
and
barrel
aging
worth
a
shot
astringent
its
crazy
and
i
like
crazy
but
its
not
too
tasty
the
feel
is
the
worstlike
spiked

smell
becomes
menacing

got
a
finger
of
rocky
offwhite
head
with
limited
retention
from
the
pour
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishamberyellow
nose
smelled
like
wintergreen
like
a
snowy
forest
with
pine
trees
in
abundance
i
had
a
battle
of
the
bulge
vet
in
last
year
and
he
said
that
when
the
heavy
artillery
began
toppling
trees
in
the
ardennes
forest
the
scent
of
pine
put
him
off
of
christmas
trees
for
life
i
had
no
such
experience
and
love
the
scent
of
pine
but
no
love
for
celebrating
christmas
so
no
trees
in
my
house
it
was
hard
to
discern
between
the
wood
of
the
barrels
and
the
minty
smell
of
juniper
but
either
way
i
was
beginning
to
champ
at
the
bit
to
get
some
on
my
tongue
it
was
initially
cool
and
minty
with
a
medium
presence
on
the
tongue
which
was
enjoyable
the
finish
however
gave
off
an
intense
dill
flavor
which
one
previous
reviewer
referred
to
as
picklelike
i
have
to
agree
there
mman
this
was
definitely
not
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
was
not
an
outright
fail
but
nor
was
it
a
repeater
if
you
catch
my
snow
drift
o
cant
think
of
a
reason
to
buy
this
again
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
frothy
head
which
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
junipers
and
malt
the
taste
starts
with
a
juniper
and
pale
malt
taste
but
gives
way
to
a
slight
spruce
flavor
the
end
of
the
beer
has
a
gin
taste
to
it
from
the
barrels
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
as
the
beer
went
on
i
began
to
enjoy
it
more
and
more
the
taste
was
intersting
and
had
just
enough
variety
to
keep
me
interested
i
would
for
sure
pick
this
up
again
this
is
an
interesting
idea
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
is
entirely
undrinkable
and
i
wish
i
could
just
drink
the
same
beer
but
not
brewed
in
gin
barrels
o
this
is
an
unusual
and
somehow
drinkable
beer
its
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
well
made
overall
very
pleased
with
this
rouge
offering
but
i
love
gin
as
well
and
this
has
that
quality
to
it
with
the
addition
of
juniper
berries
and
what
seems
to
be
a
lemon
zest
bitter
orange
peel
and
a
small
bit
of
licorice
in
it
pretty
good
pours
a
pale
light
yellow
color
with
a
soapy
head
and
some
lace
aroma
of
barrel
wet
wood
vegetation
and
spruce
in
the
taste
mild
tannins
on
a
very
bland
body
reminiscent
of
crystal
malts
and
some
herbal
elements
hint
of
a
gin
like
bite
and
then
washes
to
nothing
light
bodied
soft
carbonation
and
a
semi
clean
finish
overall
an
interesting
delicate
ale
with
some
gin
flavor
and
mild
barrel
notes
not
bad
i
had
forgotten
that
this
was
a
regular
strength
beer
somehow
despite
my
initial
misgivings
this
lower
gravity
pale
ale
works
pretty
well
with
this
treatment
this
is
quite
drinkable
the
fact
that
it
finishes
so
dry
though
it
still
has
some
texture
body
to
it
helps
with
this
immensely
too
definitely
worth
trying
this
beer
reminds
me
why
i
rarely
drink
rogue
beers
not
to
be
mean
but
theyre
often
not
high
quality
its
taste
is
very
distinct
once
again
the
juniper
berries
help
create
it
but
the
gin
barrels
seems
to
give
the
berries
and
citrus
notes
an
extra
bite
in
taste
this
package
helps
make
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
surprisingly
refreshing
still
the
pricetag
that
it
commands
8
for
the
pint
mean
that
future
meetings
will
be
scarce
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
nice
and
juicy
at
first
but
quickly
dries
out
as
the
gin
makes
itself
known
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
but
is
impacted
by
the
beer
tasting
more
alcoholic
than
it
actually
is
overall
a
solid
beer
and
better
than
the
hazelnut
john
john
for
sure
recommended
but
i
wouldnt
spend
too
much
on
it
overall
i
do
like
this
one
and
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
ill
buy
it
again
this
a
fairly
simple
beer
there
is
plenty
of
juniper
but
the
balance
doesnt
quite
seem
right
this
was
a
little
better
than
the
regular
juniper
ale
the
pour
was
orange
and
had
some
yellow
highlights
the
head
was
thin
and
didnt
lace
too
much
the
smell
was
a
bit
more
herbal
the
taste
had
subtle
flavors
of
spruce
and
gin
still
not
enough
flavor
for
me
to
love
this
beer
though
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
much
different
it
was
medium
bodied
overall
just
a
touch
better
than
the
original
not
all
in
all
neither
make
me
wanna
run
back
to
the
store
for
more
nothing
extraordinairy
here
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
overall
i
thought
d
would
and
will
buy
again
i
like
this
one
more
than
the
og
juniper
pale
the
gin
barrels
added
more
complexity
and
softened
the
juniper
flavor
tastes
delicious
if
you
like
juniper
that
is
my
husband
doesnt
care
for
them
and
he
could
barely
stomach
this
brew
theres
a
hint
of
pine
flavor
too
which
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
flavor
its
getting
hot
and
humid

in

and
this
brew
will
replace
the
usual
wits
and
heffes
on
yard
work
day
overall
get
to
know
and
appreciate
the
flavor
profile
of
juniper
and
this
berr
will
be
appreciated
much
like
a
sahti
without
the
spicy
rye
flavors
i
will
be
drinking
this
for
walpurgisnacht
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
because
of
the
uniqueness
this
would
have
been
a
great
food
beer
with
a
light
chicken
turkey
or
fish
dish
worth
a
try
for
the
originality
but
nothing
phenomenal
or
a
brew
you
need
to
try
overall
this
brew
is
a
mess
i
am
a
fan
of
juniper
pale
ale
but
this
brew
is
a
huge
side
step
from
it
over
priced
and
under
developed
for
taste
john
john
brings
a
nice
light
balance
of
flavors
hop
spice
is
evident
but
not
pronounced
with
some
nice
bite
of
carbonation
the
juniper
berries
and
spruce
add
some
subtle
spice
to
the
hop
spice
i
believe
i
get
a
sort
of
sour
taste
but
not
something
im
put
off
by
that
lingers
a
bit
along
with
citrus
the
aging
in
spruce
gin
barrels
have
made
the
pale
ale
less
harsh
in
its
hop
spice
something
that
im
obsessed
with
but
the
john
john
ale
is
extremely
drinkable
and
an
interesting
beer
to
try
it
looks
and
tastes
more
like
a
blonde
to
me
though
not
that
thats
bad
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
since
its
so
damn
hot
out
in
texas
i
dont
think
this
is
great
but
it
is
very
good
john
john
ale
has
a
darkish
cloudy
orange
colour
and
a
0
5
cm
soapy
head
that
reduces
to
a
nice
even
lacing
very
quickly
the
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
fruity
berries
with
a
hint
of
yeast
interesting
but
i
dont
love
it
this
beer
starts
with
a
sour
tang
fruity
and
yum
the
finish
is
slightly
woody
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
smoke
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
worth
tasting

an

indeed
try
it
sometime
d
i
despise
gin
now
but
this
was
very
good
and
exceeded
my
expectations
hell
i
liked
this
one
it
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
pretty
drinkable
d
drinkable
but
overall
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
yellow
amber
with
a
wispy
head
smells
like
a
pine
forest
with
lots
of
juniper
and
some
spruce
definitely
somewhat
ginlike
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
softer
and
even
more
ginlike
less
of
an
impact
from
the
spruce
soft
and
sort
of
like
a
watered
down
martini
interesting
and
fairly
enjoyable
d
its
ok
to
try
but
probablt
will
not
drink
again
one
thing
ive
noticed
if
the
review
gets
wordy
it
deserves
a
superior
score
heres
one
to
seek
out
for
something
different
yet
not
extreme
in
any
way
22
ounce
bomber
poured
into
a
basic
pint
glass
color
is
a
bright
golden
yellow
big
pillowy
head
with
some
pretty
darned
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
perhaps
not
surprisingly
flowers
specifically
juniper
light
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
bittersweet
finish
taste
is
very
floral
with
tons
of
juniper
throughout
the
beer
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
cleverly
hidden
its
aged
on
spruce
gin
barrels
but
you
cant
seem
to
find
it
the
beer
is
a
little
out
of
balance
due
to
the
heavy
handed
use
of
juniper
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
alternative
to
your
normal
every
day
fare
an
interesting
diversion

taste
is
pleasant
spicy
with
some

and

i
was
worried
when
i
saw
that
it
was
aged
in
gin
barrels
but
the
gin
flavor
is
a
mild
under
taste
that
didnt
bother
me
wasnt
bad
but
nothing
i
would
have
again
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
this
one
smells
and
tastes
like
a
bucket
of
water
with
household
cleaner
thats
been
laying
around
for
a
couple
of
days
try
for
yourself
but
i
guarantee
you
wont
want
to
try
it
again
also
ive
read
about
people
paying
upwards
of
9
for
a
22

i
paid
6

no
more
excellent

this
taste
like
slightly
hoped
pinot
grigio
aged
in

i
like
that
its
different
but
one
is
plenty
it
definitely
has
that
super
dry
gin
feeling
towards
the
end
john
john
ale
spruce
gin
barrel
aged
is
a
semisuccessful
experiment
if
you
have
a
thing
for
herbedspiced
beer
rogue
pulled
it
off
better
than
most
but
8
99
for
the
bomber
is
not
worth
a
second
purchase
d
interesting
beer
and
very
drinkable
the
herbal
character
is
kept
at
a
good
level
where
its
assertive
but
not
overbearing
it
does
go
down
well
although
i
really
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
more
ginlike
kick
to
this
brew
imagine
this
in
an
imperial
style
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
junipers
they
used
to
make
this
beer
are
very
subtle
and
dont
leap
out
at
you
the
aging
makes
for
a
very
smooth
taste
i
like
it
a
lot
definitely
would
drink
again
d
a
very
fine
mix
of
hop
qualities
with
the
tart
sweetness
of
juniper
berries
and
the
light
pine
hint
from
the
gin
cask
finishing
is
subtle
but
complimentary
d
not
bad
considering
the
potential
to
go
awry
aging
an
apa
in
gin
barrels
kudos
to
rogue
for
the
cajones
actually
a
bit
more
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
deeper
down
the
glass
i
go
going
solo
here
might
go
well
with
some
sharp
cheese
or
even
slightly
spicy
thai
food
the
only
other
juniper
spiced
beer
ive
had
was
the
dipa
from
midnight
sun
and
the
juniper
character
there
was
both
powerful
and
satisfying
none
of
that
here
poured
with
a
nice
golden
to
orange
color
and
a
head
that
lingered
leaving
a
nice
rim
and
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
herbs
and
grass
clean
maybe
minty
it
deffinatly
hints
towards
the
presence
or
affiliation
with
gin
the
taste
was
light
on
hops
and
malty
sweetness
but
had
an
unusual
and
never
experienced
bite
at
the
end
that
was
like
that
of
gin
a
drywetness
lets
say
the
taste
was
unique
and
different
and
i
like
the
idea
of
something
that
has
bitterness
appeal
without
being
overly
hopped
the
color
and
the
unusal
taste
were
the
best
parts
i
would
drink
this
again
an
elegant
herbaceous
drink
pleasant
likely
very
good
with
most
food
profiles
a
very
pale
yellow
color
clear
with
a
fair
white
cover
that
thins
out
quickly
and
very
thorough
lacing
the
aroma
is
intense
but
tasteful
juniper
biscuit
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
juniper
with
a
bright
blueberry
sweetness
and
an
interesting
vinegar
tartness
almost
rhubarb
biscuit
and
wheat
malt
infused
with
juniper
hop
in
a
crisp
lightmedium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
tingly
feel
quite
drinkable
and
successful
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
malt
and
juniper
berry
aroma
the
gin
barrels
give
off
a
nice
character
that
works
well
with
the
tart
fruit
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
good
malt
and
fruit
flavor
however
the
gin
barrel
aging
gives
it
an
undesirable
finish
its
bitter
with
a
touch
of
sourness
im
not
a
huge
fan
but
its
adventurous
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
the
gin
barrel
aging
leaves
me
on
the
fence
with
this
one
keep
trying
though
rogue
has
some
amazing
beers
d
normally
im
not
a
big
rogue
fan
but
i
do
enjoy
gin
so
i
wanted
to
try
this
it
was
actually
pretty
nice
but
not
really
worth

i
would
recommend
this
as
a

d

not

good
representation
of

this
is
a
decent

to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
into
the
juniper
flavor
i
perhaps
had
slightly
elevated
expectations
being
a
gin
lover
i
have
yet
to
try
rogues
gin
and
it
may
be
a
very
subtle
distillation
but
knowing
rogue
i
would
think
not
perhaps
the
gin
barrels
do
not
impart
flavor
as
well
as
others
but
the
juniper
and
lemon
were
so
faint
that
this
just
became
a
fairly
interesting
pale
ale
as
i
said
my
expectations
may
have
been
high
but
at
9
a
bottle
and
being
barrel
aged
perhaps
they
should
be
i
saw
this
one
on
a
recent
detour
to
mondo
vino
and
although
i
thought
it
was
overpriced
at
9bomber
i
hadnt
seen
it
before
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
again
and
gin
barrel
aging
seemed
unique
and
interesting
this
was
a
nice
fresh
somewhat
hoppy
pale
ale
with
loads
of
gin
flavors
juniper
spruce
and
a
little
wood
quick
easy
to
drink
and
ultimately
forgettable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
but
overall
very
solid
making
this
an
interestingly
drinkable
odd
brew
md
well
blended
and
layered
a
smooth
beer
and
easily
sessionable
the
juniper
adds
a
delectable
earthiness
nice
brew
this
beer
is
pleasant
enough
to
drink
and
wellbalanced
but
theres
nothing
to
rave
about
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
more
assertive
botanical
or
barrelaged
character
taste
is
outstanding
balanced
and
complex
very
engaging
and
though
full
of
flavour
is
still
fairly
restrained
it
is
also
slightly
unusual
in
subtle
ways
firm
light
malty
base
of
lightly
sweet
grain
strong
yeastiness
mostly
pear
a
faint
hint
of
banana
definite
herbalspiceywoody
hops
complex
and
hard
to
pin
down
exactly
although
i
can
detect
a
light
but
definite
hint
of
juniper
before
the
spiceysweet
finish
it
has
a
long
aftertaste
feel
is
very
solid
lively
and
engaging
yet
with
faint
creamy
oiliness
drinkability
to
me
is
outstanding
while
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
much
like
the
other
john
john
release
this
doesnt
quite
meet
expectations
and
is
fairly
middle
of
the
road
poured
into
a
dfh
snifter
pours
a
hazy
yellow
wiht
a
bit
of
head
that
stays
the
entire
drink
no
lace
smell
is
pretty
saison
to
me
it
does
that
that
belgium
character
to
it
with
maybe
a
hint
of
spruce
to
it
taste
was
pretty
bland
up
front
with
a
slow
alcohol
waxy
taste
towards
the
back
end
with
a
wood
herbal
type
finish
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
much
better
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
d
the
brew
drank
very
good
and
was
really
tasty
to
me
since
i
do
enjoy
an
occasional
gin
cocktail
im
glad
somebody
got
the
balls
to
age
a
beer
in
gin
barrel
good
call
not
something
to
have
all
the
time
but
certainly
a
wonderful
treat
taste
nice
beer
loved
the
gin
and
spruce
flavors
not
dominat
at
all
i
might
have
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
dig
this
stuff
nothing
great
in
the
smell
the
sip
is
piney
ipa
but
then
you
do
get
the
juicy
bite
of
the
juniper
it
goes
well
with
the
piney
ipa
bite
the
juniper
is
not
sweet
but
tart
which
goes
with
the
bitter
bite
of
the
pine
its
different
but
not
over
the
top
great
i
would
have
again
but
its
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
would
like
to
see
this
tweaked
a
bit
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
although
for
what
i
paid
for
the
bottle
it
will
be
an
every
once
in
a
while
indigence
ive
been
known
to
knock
back
a
few
gin
drinks
in
my
day
so
john
john
juniper
certainly
intrigued
me
first
it
has
a
great
pale
ale
appearance
with
a
golden
yelloworange
color
and
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
was
expecting
a
strange
combination
of
hops
and
herbs
with
all
of
the
aromatic
ingredients
but
there
just
was
not
much
there
the
aroma
was
just
grainy
and
a
bit
musty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
flavor
was
certainly
better
with
a
solid
pale
ale
base
of
pine
earth
and
lemon
the
added
botanicals
seem
to
boost
the
pine
characteristics
and
the
juniper
adds
a
little
something
extra
texturally
it
is
resinous
and
a
bit
boozy
from
the
barrel
aging
but
also
nicely
carbonated
and
mouthfilling
overall
it
is
a
decent
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
intrigue
but
the
ginbarrel
aging
makes
this
one
seem
too
boozy
to
want
to
go
back
for
more
after
all
it
is
never
a
good
sign
when
you
want
to
add
tonic
to
your
beer
easy
almost
too
easy
to
drink
easily
could
have
more
than
one
d
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
it
was
slightly
refreshing
and
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
something
different
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
some
sediment
and
moderate
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
honey
and
vanilla
and
green
oak
with
some
heather
or
wild
clover
and
wheat
and
a
little
sugary
lemon
it
tasted
like
green
oak
and
citrus
with
honey
and
heatherclover
and
a
little
banana
nut
bread
it
was
oily
with
a
little
carbonation
and
had
a
mellow
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
interesting
scent
and
taste
i
really
respect
the
beers
concept
and
execution
but
the
taste
just
wasnt
overly
enjoyable
to
me
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
oaked
ipas
and
this
barrelaged
maibock
seems
similar
to
me
however
it
was
a
fairly
clean
beer
with
decent
body
and
was
easy
enough
to
drink
nice
experiment
to
drink
once
but
thats
about
it
now
im
curious
to
try
dead
guy
whiskey
overall
an
interesting
concept
that
was
fun
to
try
but
now
that
ive
had
it
i
dont
know
if
i
would
order
it
again
on
its
own
merits
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
had
trouble
noticing
the
juniper
flavors
until
i
started
slowing
down
my
sips
its
gentle
as
i
suppose
it
should
be
though
admittedly
i
havent
had
many
beers
with
this
characteristic
drinkability
is
very
good
the
light
body
and
clean
non
overpowering
flavors
make
this
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
90s
d
not
very
offensive
but
just
very
underwhelming
another
good
idea
from
a
forward
thinking
brewery
falls
victim
to
a
lack
of
refinement
as
certain
ingrediants
overpower
and
dominate
the
pale
ale
not
a
beer
id
want
a
lot
of
very
good
beer
original
flavor
and
feel
that
is
definitely
a
high
quality
and
well
thought
out
recipe
drinkability
it
took
a
while
to
drink
because
the
piney
spruce
taste
was
rather
strong
for
a
lighter
beer
a
beer
worth
checking
out
for
the
flavor
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
that
i
like
this
beer
so
much
other
than
i
just
do
i
doesnt
really
seem
to
stand
out
yet
it
stood
out
among
among
all
the
beers
at
beerfest
i
like
it
d
would
i
buy
this
again
probably
definitely
worth
a
try
and
offered
some
very
unique
flavours
making
for
an
enjoyable
and
memorable
experience
at
10bottle
its
a
little
pricey
but
tasty
nonetheless
whats
with
the
mystery
abv
the
drinkability
is
fine
i
like
gin
so
it
goes
down
easily
enough
i
was
hoping
for
something
else
when
i
got
this
and
while
it
isnt
bad
at
all
its
a
little
clumsy
glad
it
tried
it
though
d
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
i
didnt
think
there
was
much
to
the
smell
but
the
gni
really
came
out
in
the
taste
which
was
unfortunate
would
not
buy
again
light
in
color
with
an
interesting
aroma
that
comes
from
the
good
carbonation
juniper
flavor
is
subtle
and
the
beer
does
not
taste
too
strong
although
i
have
no
idea
of
the
alcohol
by
volume
ill
have
this
again
and
would
recommend
it
pours
a
light
orange
with
nice
head
and
lacing
smell
of
the
spurce
immediately
jumps
out
at
me
it
really
does
smell
like
christmas
taste
seems
to
be
much
more
mellow
than
the
smell
and
i
find
the
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
this
beer
could
be
an
awesome
air
freshener
but
i
was
a
bit
tired
of
drinking
as
i
finished
my
glass
yellow
body
with
a
fancy
white
head
some
carbonation
spruce
confers
in
aromas
not
a
bad
drinker
like
the
spruce
and
gin
was
ok
then
again
nothing
special
particularly
the
juniper
taste
low
carbonation
a
little
spicey
thanks
for
sending
presario
the
regular
ale
is
a
little
bland
near
the
start
and
then
the
rush
of
fruit
and
weeds
near
the
end
throws
you
off
balance
this
is
actually
much
firmer
up
front
its
still
not
very
strong
and
if
anything
the
hop
presence
is
remarkably
even
weaker
but
theres
a
bigger
profile
of
herbs
and
since
im
not
an
herbalist
i
really
lack
the
critical
vocabulary
to
describe
it
except
for
that
there
is
indeed
a
little
bit
of
pine
this
moves
into
a
maltier
middle
thats
like
a
lemony
epa
and
then
it
ends
on
a
very
nice
dry
rush
of
pine
and
more
generic
herbs
drinkability
quite
drinkable
im
finding
i
like
this
beer
a
little
bit
better
with
each
sip
ive
had
other
juniper
beers
before
which
had
much
more
juniper
flavor
but
this
one
manages
to
be
good
without
an
overpowering
gin
character
pour
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
piney
but
mild
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
mostly
a
one
mote
flavor
profile
for
me
but
what
is
there
is
decent
well
carbonated
nut
maybe
just
a
bit
thinner
than
is
like
on
the
palate
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
a
full
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
very
balanced
beer
nothing
overpowers
in
it
and
all
the
different
flavors
work
very
nicely
with
each
other
it
would
be
great
to
see
more
beers
like
this
its
a
creative
use
of
barrel
aging
to
create
a
balanced
somewhat
low
abv
beer
overall
one
of
the
worst
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
will
not
be
looking
for
this
one
again
anytime
soon
drinkabilty
is
above
average
its
interesting
enough
to
want
more
and
finishes
clean
enough
to
keep
from
getting
overwhelming
drinkability
good
meh
i
appreciate
the
subtle
nuances
of
the
juniper
spruce
and
gin
in
this
beer
but
these
are
not
bold
enough
part
of
the
problem
is
the
sweetheavy
texture
that
lacks
dryness
or
crispness
these
characteristics
are
why
gin
beverages
are
so
great
opportunity
lost
here
d
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
overall
the
flavor
of
alcohol
makes
it
seem
stronger
than
5
2
which
is
what
was
listed
on
the
tap
menu
the
pale
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
a
first
pint
i
would
order
this
again
if
i
see
it
an
interesting
concept
for
a
spiced
pale
ale
finally
the
drinkability
rates
higher
than
average
but
its
not
a
beer
ill
be
recommending
unless
someones
an
ipagin
lover
but
better
than
i
feared
and
another
hit
in
the
john
john
series
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
with
a
light
herbal
flavor
and
a
well
balanced
malt
richness
that
is
quite
similar
to
the
standard
version
of
rogues
juniper
pale
ale
much
like
the
barrel
aged
dead
guy
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
benefited
greatly
from
its
barrel
aging
the
prospect
of
juniper
pale
ale
aged
in
gin
barrels
sounded
extremely
appealing
but
the
beer
is
not
as
boldly
flavored
as
expected
it
to
be
the
herbal
character
is
more
complex
than
it
is
in
the
non
barrel
aged
version
of
the
beer
but
the
juniper
seems
relatively
subdued
with
a
ghostly
woody
character
the
only
contribution
that
i
can
confidently
trace
to
the
barrel
aging
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
and
some
people
might
find
more
to
like
in
it
than
i
did
but
in
the
end
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
a
unique
beer
and
definitely
worth
revisiting
but
not
something
id
drink
regularly
gin
barrelaged
beer
im
up
fer
it
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
thick
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wet
hay
spruce
tips
pine
sap
and
floral
hops
the
taste
holds
notes
of
juniper
berries
and
twigs
pine
sap
grass
and
a
mild
bitterness
honestly
it
seemed
like
some
cheap
gin
was
watered
down
and
had
hops
added
to
it
and
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
leading
to
a
lingering
of
the
taste
for
a
bit
too
much
time
an
interesting
brew
but
in
my
opinion
not
all
that
great
of
one
taste
light
toast
with
a
slightly
sour
edge
maybe
from
the
barrel
quite
dry
with
a
dark
herbal
undertone
up
front
the
middle
is
even
drier
and
quite
bitter
there
is
a
hint
of
juniper
but
its
faint
very
bready
as
well
as
a
little
yeast
comes
off
as
quite
think
partly
due
to
the
low
carbonation
i
think
the
finish
is
the
most
like
gin
a
bit
of
a
burn
quite
dry
and
definitely
a
juniper
bite
d
interesting
spiced
ale
with
a
fruity
sweetness
and
potpourri
of
hop
character
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
nothing
is
too
overbearing
in
the
flavor
instead
the
flavor
is
rather
subtle
and
pleasant
its
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
gentle
juniperspruce
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
like
bark
tiny
bit
of
hops
taste
is
some
hops
and
peat
no
juniper
in
the
taste
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
could
use
more
juniper
flavor
doesnt
really
make
for
a
great
barrell
aged
but
a
ok
beer
overall
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
theyre
not
filling
and
have
a
pretty
distinguishable
taste
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
rogue
could
have
done
better
i
wish
the
gin
was
more
prominent
and
the
juniper
berries
go
totally
unnoticed
due
to
the
spruce
which
takes
over
the
whole
beer
overall
quite
different
and
well
worth
trying
d
the
alcohol
content
whatever
it
may
be
is
not
apparent
a
unique
beer
im
kind
of
enthralled
with
the
idea
of
throwing
lowerabv
beers
into
barrels
especially
those
that
once
held
gin
while
john
john
isnt
necessarily
a
masterwork
its
still
plenty
enjoyable
worth
a
try
especially
for
the
bas
who
also
enjoy
a
nice
gin
from
time
to
time
i
think
im
going
to
pour
a
little
measure
of
bombay
sapphire
into
my
last
glass
here
and
see
how
it
goes
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
not
too
strong
something
nice
for
a
summer
day
but
i
was
expecting
more
d
all
in
all
a
drinkable
beer
that
leaves
you
with
a
slight
sour
twang
and
coating
on
the
tongue
drinks
like
a
saison
as
crisp
as
a
pale
with
a
generous
amount
of
hops
to
match
and
has
some
berry
spice
appeal
all
rolled
into
one
have
to
recheck
my
original
evaluation
of
their
juniper
ale
but
figure
this
one
surely
benefits
from
the
spruce
gin
barrel
aging
which
does
this
just
fine
worth
a
purchase
parts
of
it
i
enjoy
but
as
a
whole
it
doesnt
seem
to
follow
through
for
me
especially
for
the
hefty
price
tag
paid
for
it
here
in
alberta
kudos
to
rogue
for
the
experiment
it
makes
sense
to
me
however
the
final
product
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
refreshing
but
onedimensional
john
john
juniper
rates
as
above
average
in
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
me
i
wouldnt
drink
multiples
of
this
it
is
drying
to
its
benefit
but
too
subtle
and
spicy
and
sweet
for
me
to
love
it
it
reminds
me
of
the
john
john
dead
guy
ale
in
that
respect
love
the
concept
but
im
iffy
on
the
execution
d
a
solid
brew
from
rogue
i
wanted
a
little
more
barrel
character
as
i
love
gin
and
juniper
but
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
hint
of
spirit
d
good
summer
beer
though
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
one
bomber
in
a
day
a
very
interesting
brew
and
a
gin
barrel
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
drinkability
subtle
and
subdued
though
pleasant
enough
for
a
pint
while
not
a
leap
forward
it
is
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
unbearable
inaugural
beer
from
the
john
john
set
but
this
gives
me
hope
for
the
rest
of
the
series
im
ready
for
more
i
feel
ready
whats
next
id
be
interested
to
see
how
much
alcohol
is
in
this
as
this
beer
had
both
the
taste
and
the
warming
effect
that
stronger
beers
and
sprits
have
on
me
i
love
it
when
the
boundaries
are
pushed
and
even
though
this
isnt
spicy
like
a
pumpkin
ale
lovers
of
gin
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
rogues
pulled
off
here
theres
certainly
nothing
else
liket
this
on
the
market
overall
a
lackluster
and
dissappointing
brew
doesnt
deliver
for
a
barrell
aged
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
here
either
forgetable
in
my
opinion
overall
i
am
very
impressed
wish
it
were
a
painted
bottle
this
is
one
to
have
and
try
extremely
balanced
flavor
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
muggy
day
pale
and
golden
pretty
typical
pale
ale
look
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
lacking
big
time
there
is
very
little
going
on
in
this
beer
period
there
might
be
a
slight
hint
of
juniperhop
bitterness
on
the
back
palate
drinkability
depends
on
if
you
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
an
essentially
bland
beer
other
than
that
i
cant
smell
much
and
i
dont
taste
much
what
a
sad
overpriced
waste
of
time
it
is
pretty
clean
though
this
would
be
great
with
thanksgiving
dinner
i
think
ill
try
to
stow
a
few
away
the
palate
is
dry
and
full
of
bitter
and
uniquely
nuanced
flavors
i
dont
know
the
abv
but
this
is
a
session
ale
with
conversation
piece
written
all
over
it
md
thin
body
goes
well
with
the
light
herbal
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
not
sure
how
much
i
paid
i
think
around
6
overall
nice
beer
that
could
be
a
good
session
beer
though
it
sounds
like
a
lot
went
into
it
and
probably
wouldnt
scale
well
picked
this
up
from
a
great
beer
store
tops
liquor
while
at
a
conference
in
phoenix
hazy
yellow
pour
with
nice
big
but
quickly
fading
head
and
decent
lacing
disappointed
that
the
nose
was
rather
subdued
bready
musty
with
just
a
hint
of
juniper
the
flavor
was
also
disappointing
or
perhaps
my
expectations
were
a
bit
too
high
i
really
loved
the
premise
behind
this
beer
and
was
hoping
it
would
live
up
to
the
hype
the
juniper
is
present
but
barely
along
with
just
a
hint
of
gin
with
that
said
its
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
gets
better
as
your
drinking
it
good
balance
but
over
all
i
was
expecting
a
much
bolder
taste
good
drinkability
as
it
does
grow
on
you
although
it
was
a
bit
disappointing
still
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
the
body
was
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
pale
ale
drinkability
was
nice
but
not
special
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
just
dont
set
your
expectations
too
high
drinkability
nice
hopped
beer
but
really
a
miss
on
the
style
over
hopped
and
not
gonna
satisfy
someone
looking
for
juniper
falls
short
on
that
aspect
of
which
i
expected
enjoyable
but
off
style
d
somebody
suggested
this
might
pair
well
with
rosemary
and
the
web
site
suggests
either
pork
or
a
hot
and
spicy
dish
the
juniper
and
spices
in
the
beer
definitely
make
it
a
nice
beer
to
pair
up
with
the
right
dish
despite
the
spices
its
somewhat
smooth
and
refreshing
d
let
me
start
by
saying
that
im
one
of
rogues
biggest
fans
and
i
would
gladly
pay
a
few
more
for
rogue
beer
than
most
other
beers
because
i
feel
that
their
beer
is
just
better
than
most
others
that
being
said
this
beer
is
terrible
by
far
the
worst
beer
that
ive
ever
had
from
them
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
ive
never
had
a
problem
like
that
from
rogue
before
everything
has
been
very
consistent
in
my
opinion
from
them
this
was
9
down
the
drain
i
was
worried
this
beer
would
be
over
the
top
with
the
juniper
but
the
opposite
was
true
it
was
too
understated
flavor
is
again
good
but
nothing
special
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
has
a
nice
crisp
and
light
mouthfeel
initial
flavor
is
a
mixture
of
yeast
light
berry
and
again
a
mild
spice
zest
carbonation
is
high
which
is
right
on
for
the
style
of
beer
the
warmer
the
beer
gets
the
more
the
flavor
comes
out
but
overall
still
slightly
let
down
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
of
a
booze
flavor
from
the
spruce
gin
barrels
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
gin
it
was
nice
to
see
that
the
gin
barrel
didnt
have
an
overpowering
effect
on
the
base
pale
ale
the
result
is
an
approachable
herbinfluenced
beer
interesting
in
its
conception
but
overall
still
a
bit
too
much
like
consuming
forest
undergrowth
for
me
to
want
another
d
despite
being
a
barrel
aged
beer
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
at
a
steady
pace
its
quite
tasty
and
well
worth
trying
a
bit
highpriced
for
what
it
is
however
this
drinks
pretty
well
this
isnt
much
more
than
a
regular
pale
ale
to
me
the
barrel
aging
isnt
that
noticeable
and
if
i
wasnt
told
i
would
think
this
was
a
pale
ale
with
some
juniper
berries
added
in
its
a
good
brew
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
overall
this
isnt
bad
the
gin
isnt
overwhelming
nor
the
spruce
but
both
give
it
a
clean
quality
not
my
thing
but
good
nonetheless
a
decent
stab
at
something
different
from
rogue
however
i
cant
get
past
the
kink
in
the
mouthfeel
certainly
worth
a
try
either
way
id
describe
this
as
a
decent
pale
ale
with
a
little
added
complexity
warning
to
fellow
gin
lovers
the
effect
of
the
barrel
aging
is
not
huge
like
youd
expect
from
most
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
you
get
plenty
of
the
gin
character
if
its
warm
enough
good
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
and
one
would
buy
again
drinkability
is
very
good
but
being
fond
of
gin
i
may
be
biased
i
could
see
how
this
one
might
rub
some
people
the
wrong
way
i
was
happy
to
find
that
the
gin
is
more
noticeable
than
the
whiskey
was
with
jj
dead
guy
a
lovely
beer
full
of
flavour
distinct
after
taste
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
the
feel
was
assaulting
and
there
was
barely
a
hint
of
juniper
in
it
i
love
rogue
and
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
them
have
been
superb
that
being
said
you
cant
win
them
all
and
this
beer
is
proof
that
even
rogue
produces
duds
every
once
in
a
while
fine
taste
that
makes
me
not
want
stop
drinking
it
keep
coming
back
for
more
overall
not
half
bad
although
like
others
id
be
hard
put
to
pick
out
the
juniper
if
i
didnt
already
know
about
it
a
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
in
stark
contrast
to
some
of
the
hopbombs
ive
had
recently
and
the
juniper
adds
a
nice
twist
the
rogue
in
me
thanks
you
pours
a
mostly
clear
gold
with
average
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
light
smells
between
a
good
pale
ale
and
a
light
ipa
dont
pick
up
much
of
the
juniper
in
the
aroma
taste
is
of
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
with
a
light
touch
of
the
juniper
not
too
much
overall
i
might
not
know
the
juniper
was
in
there
unless
you
told
me
overall
though
a
good
pale
ale
balanced
well
and
feeling
good
on
the
palate
light
aftertatste
pretty
clean
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
the
juniper
flavor
added
a
different
note
that
i
enjoyed
not
a
huge
fan
of
everything
rogue
is
doing
but
this
one
is
a
winner
surprisingly
citrusy
with
enough
bready
malt
backbone
to
counter
the
slightly
bitter
finish
juniper
doesnt
overwhelm
rating
c
overall
really
solid
would
be
easy
to
session
tastes
like
a
mediocre
ale
with
a
shot
of
mediocre
gin
tipped
into
it
say
no
more
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
was
not
impressed
at
first
but
the
tasted
definitely
grew
on
me
i
disagree
with
all
the
average
reviews
this
juniper
ale
was
a
wellbalanced
juniper
pine
spices
were
quite
noticeable
which
went
great
with
the
honey
malt
flavors
and
the
hops
at
the
finish
worth
getting
again
o
decent
lacking
in
aroma
tastes
fine
o
nothing
great
about
this
beer
easy
drinker
but
was
expecting
different
flavors
from
the
herbal
notes
but
didnt
find
them
overall
once
again
an
average
beer
from
rogue
for
an
exhorbitant
price
this
is
the
third
ive
had
and
the
third
that
is
way
overpriced
i
would
compare
this
beer
at
au140
a
case
to
matilda
bays
fat
yak
at
au52
a
case
overall
a
good
pale
overall
nothing
mindblowing
but
great
balance
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
entirely
drinkable
quite
quaffable
a
really
nice
pale
ale
not
overly
complicated
but
well
balanced
and
smooth
drinkability

and
very

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
its
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
put
back
several
of
these
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
draft
this
beer
is
alright
though
not
at
the
same
level
as
other
rogues
nice
to
know
how
a
beer
with
juniper
tastes
which
was
a
more
common
ingredient
in
the
past
the
one
i
had
a
while
ago
seemed
fresher
with
less
papaya
this
is
due
in
6
months
o
just
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
the
bitterness
is
dull
and
not
that
pleasant
and
there
isnt
really
much
flavor
overall
a
nice
beer
o
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
reminds
me
of
spring
time
and
has
a
great
drink
ability
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
because
it
is
surprisingly
light
the
experience
i
have
with
rogue
is
usually
a
large
big
beer
taste
which
i
typically
favor
i
like
the
strong
fruit
flavors
from
this
beer
overall
fruity
and
light
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
out
of
a
winter
seasonal
brewed
with
juniper
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
witbier
a
decent
new
one
for
me
but
cant
say
it
rocked
my
world
juniper
pale
ale
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
dry
fruity
aroma
with
a
sharp
malt
notes
the
taste
has
a
sharp
and
strong
malty
backbone
with
some
juniper
flavors
coming
through
near
the
end
finishes
dry
which
i
like
good
flavors
good
body
but
cheap
beer
base
overall
its
almost
a
good
beer
i
like
the
juniper
flavors
but
the
cheap
beer
base
really
hurts
this
hazy
apple
juice
yellow
with
a
thin
large
bubble
head
smells
pretty
good
a
little
bit
of
crunchy
fruit
and
a
bit
of
grass
that
might
be
the
juniper
im
not
sure
i
would
be
able
to
pick
out
the
juniper
smell
without
knowing
it
was
there
already
likewise
with
the
taste
i
think
i
got
some
juniper
flavor
but
i
was
looking
for
it
tastes
like
a
pilsner
with
a
little
bit
of
lawn
clipping
i
like
it
and
would
not
turn
one
down
but
as
this
isnt
one
of
rogues
most
common
beers
there
will
probably
be
something
id
prefer
if
im
in
a
place
that
has
it
o
a
unique
american
ale
with
some
juniper
flavours
reminds
me
most
of
an
american
ipa
with
slightly
more
bittering
hops
love
the
bottle
a
strange
but
enjoyable
beer
with
an
unusual
balance
between
the
berries
and
the
sweet
malts
that
seems
to
follow
it
in
both
the
taste
and
smell
a
nice
one
but
perhaps
one
that
could
have
been
a
little
stronger
throughout
overall
i
have
had
better
beers
from
rogue
it
was
okay
but
i
will
not
buy
this
one
again

aftertaste
so
much
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
dull
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
there
are
some
nice
bready
malt
aromas
with
some
floral
hop
aromas
i
also
get
some
of
that
juniper
in
the
nose
the
bready
malt
provides
some
nice
flavor
and
theres
some
sweetness
i
get
some
of
that
juniper
as
well
but
its
not
powerful
i
get
some
of
that
spiciness
that
is
presumably
coming
from
the
juniper
which
plays
well
with
all
the
flavors

here
the
body
is
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
and
refreshing
beer
o
good
drinkability
rogues
quality
recommended
pours
a
sunny
yelloworange
hue
with
decent
clarity
the
initial
12
head
is
retained
fairly
well
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
in
the
aroma
i
could
pick
up
sweet
maltiness
a
spray
of
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
the
juniper
after
a
taste
i
get
sweet
bread
out
of
this
and
european
hop
bitterness
the
finish
comes
off
as
herbal
and
is
where
one
mostly
tastes
the
juniper
its
very
subtle
i
wish
it
was
more
dominant
this
beer
is
primarily
an
apa
and
there
are
better
ones
out
there
still
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
dash
of
something
different
in
the
mix
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
quality
brew
a
very
pale
and
lean
apa
more
like
a
lager
nothing
here
tastewise
that
couldnt
have
come
from
an
overdose
of
hops
so
im
not
sure
i
get
the
pine
of
juniper
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
or
wanted
and
far
more
summer
than
winter
overall
in
a
way
i
am
happy
this
beer
is
not
skunked
since
i
left
it
in
the
backseat
of
a
hot
car
overnight
but
its
close
to
it
with
bitters
and
pale
malts
its
just
not
that
great
overall
im
classifying
this
in
the
its
a
good
craft
beer
to
try
for
craft
beer
newbies
weaning
themselves
off
of
bud
light
category
its
nothing
extraordinary
to
a
seasoned
craft
palette
its
got
some
flavor
but
its
got
a
slight
underlying
taste
that
falls
in
line
with
something
that
tastes
similar
to
a
domestic
its
got
better
flavor
and
hoppiness
to
it
though
which
shouldnt
come
off
too
strong
for
a
newbie
palette
would
definitely
be
a
good
lawnmowing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
need
something
crisp
and
refreshing
good
session
beer
o
this
is
light
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
hue
slight
head
and
a
little
lacing
nose
is
bready
and
piney
piney
hop
accentuated
with
a
little
italian
spice
dry
and
bitter
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
juniper
doesnt
really
come
out
as
much
as
it
should
i
dont
think
in
this
brew
not
nearly
as
out
there
as
the
john
john
ale
but
still
a
decent
pale
ale
for
what
it
is
hazy
brassy
colored
with
a
short
white
head
rather
generic
yet
still
really
appealing
with
a
little
foam
running
down
the
side
of
my
frosted
pint
glass
slightly
fruity
nose
slightly
astringent
slightly
bland
american
malted
barley
and
west
coast
hops
in
lower
dose
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
balanced
but
more
malty
than
hoppy
i
think
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
bread
to
it
and
the
juniper
comes
in
at
the
end
with
a
fresh
pine
medicinal
vibe
its
not
out
of
place
really
just
sort
of
a
funny
addition
i
much
prefer
the
john
john
for
juniper
although
i
didnt
love
that
beer
either
bright
carbonation
and
a
drinkably
medium
body
if
it
wasnt
so
funny
in
the
stomach
id
have
several
not
my
favorite
thing
from
rogue
but
i
certainly
appreciate
the
attempt
o
beautiful
looking
beer
not
the
freshest
example
im
sure
aroma
was
modest
and
the
flavor
was
unusual
had
near
the
same
mouthfeel
as
a
good
pale
ale
unique
in
its
own
right
but
i
didnt
especially
enjoy
the
strange
twanginess
to
the
flavor
worth
trying
once
but
not
quite
worth
seeking
out
again
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
an
ideally
fresh
sample
but
i
know
it
has
been
treated
well
refrigerated
the
juniper
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
in
fact
it
seems
barely
there
to
me
but
its
nice
this
is
a
good
tasting
brew
there
is
nothing
really
outstanding
about
any
one
facet
except
that
it
is
allaround
enjoyable
a
great
warm
summer
day
drink
i
would
get
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
however
even
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
that
it
really
just
cuts
off
the
tongue
really
quickly
this
helps
the
drinkability
but
not
what
you
expect
from
a
juniper
pale
ale
not
a
great
beer
for
me
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
lightness
and
drinkability
the
flavors
blend
nicely
giving
a
light
and
fruity
yet
citric
and
juicy
balance
throughout
this
keeps
things
lively
and
drinking
easily
to
the
last
sip
especially
when
coupled
with
the
soft
feel
the
nose
was
comparatively
weak
with
adjuncts
and
corn
ringing
heavily
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beverage
but
we
do
wish
that
the
fruitiness
was
just
a
bit
more
prominent
medium
body
decent
carbonation
crisp
and
clean
on
the
tongue
i
was
able
to
detect
some
juniper
elements
here
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
more
expressive
flavor
especially
in
the
hop
profile
from
a
bomber
this
beer
is
a
clear
pale
golden
color
not
much
of
a
head
medium
carbonation
the
juniper
and
a
little
spice
is
very
dominant
in
the
smell
malt
pae
with
some
flowery
and
resiny
scents
yeast
and
a
little
musty
earthiness
semisweet
and
malty
spice
follows
to
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
to
tonguenumbingness
medium
body
overall
quite
good
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
overall
this
is
ok
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
handed
to
me
but
its
nothing
to
rave
about
great
pale
ale
and
makes
thanks
giving
a
blast
poured
coppery
clear
obviously
fizzy
thick
soapy
head
that
persisted
for
some
time
aroma
didnt
get
much
there
very
light
citrus
no
juniper
maybe
a
little
malty
very
bitter
on
the
taste
not
citrus
and
no
juniper
initially
a
little
sweetness
some
malty
notes
but
extremely
bitter
very
dry
at
the
finish
and
then
get
some
junipergin
flavor
it
was
an
ok
beer
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
to
find
i
wish
it
were
more
intoxicating
what
is
most
disappointing
about
the
mouthfeel
is
that
the
beer
neither
tastes
like
juniper
nor
a
pale
ale
its
just
some
weird
amalgamation
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
know
where
it
is
going
where
its
been
or
what
is
inside
of
it
ultimately
it
is
less
than
average
for
a
pale
ale
a
rogue
beer
or
an
herbspice
beer
pass
i
think
i
like
rogue
generally
more
than
the
average
beeradvocate
but
definitely
not
this
one
hand
me
a
chocolate
stout
instead
please
overall
this
is
basically
an
average
american
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
been
there
done
that
time
to
move
on
juniper
pale
ale
the
bottle
says
na
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
a
bit
malt
forward
and
the
juniper
berries
are
faint
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
im
not
sure
ill
buy
it
again
but
id
never
turn
it
down
poured
a
beautiful
bright
golden
color
with
a
tight
2
finger
head
and
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
faint
but
nice
with
a
hint
of
spice
hops
adn
malt
all
balanced
but
far
from
overdone
or
in
your
face
taste
was
also
subtle
and
that
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
slight
spice
from
the
juniper
light
on
th
ebitterness
but
it
was
there
the
malts
were
very
well
balanced
with
the
bitterness
and
slight
sweetness
refreshing
and
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
o
nothing
special
about
this
beer
overall
not
the
worst
but
not
very
memorable
either
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
o
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
really
not
super
exciting
on
the
flavor
front
especially
for
something
as
promisingsounding
as
a
juniper
pale
by
no
means
bad
but
far
off
the
mark
of
either
my
favorite
pale
ale
or
herbedspiced

pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
medium
slowly
dissipating

some

some

of
nutty
notes
overall
an
average
brew
nothing
special
about
this
brew
o
this
is
a
solid
and
drinkable
pale
ale
the
addition
of
juniper
berries
definitely
makes
the
taste
more
interesting
t
bland
not
bad
but
very
bland
grain
slight
yeast
taste
malt
profile
is
ok
slight
floral
hop
slightly
herbal
i
like
juniper
berries
and
love
them
in
the
only
other
beer
ive
had
with
them
which
is
mammoth
395
ipa
one
of
my
favorites
specifially
because
of
the
juniper
but
this
beer
has
none
that
i
can
really
taste
pretty
disappointing
but
my
expectations
keep
going
lower
and
lower
for
rogue
beers
3
c
o
rogue
sometimes
dosent
get
enuff
credit
imo
bc
they
have
been
making
good
beer
for
a
long
time
there
are
not
the
latest
and
greatest
but
everytime
i
pick
one
up
im
pleased
this
is
the
2nd
or
3rd
time
ive
had
this
brew
and
will
continue
to
pick
it
up
as
the
spring
seasons
come
and
go
its
an
enjoyable
citrus
pale
ale
thats
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
will
satisfy
most
pale
ale
lovers
taste
bubs
year
in
and
out
okay
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
though
o
while
the
flavours
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
this
beer
was
not
memorable
for
either
the
flavour
or
the
scent
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
herbaceous
complex
flavour
or
smell
but
was
left
trying
to
finding
it
all
the
way
through
while
i
didnt
find
the
juniper
anywhere
i
find
this
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
id
reach
for
o
terrible
beer
on
my
palette
it
wasnt
the
quality
just
the
taste
does
not
suit
my
liking
if
it
were
only
available
in
six
packs
id
start
reaching
for
it
instead
of
the
other
stand
by
pales
taste
not
real
strongly
hopped
slight
touch
of
grain
and
sweetness
the
finish
is
rather
dry
without
much
flavor
except
some
sweetness
dry
piney
finish
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
exclusivity
of
being
a
separate
beer
on
the
rogue
roster
overall
this
beer
is
subtle
and
balanced
it
could
have
gone
wrong
in
many
ways
but
it
manages
to
stay
on
track
at
the
same
time
i
wish
the
juniper
was
a
bit
more
pronounced
im
really
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
juniper
flavor
in
this
beer
but
moreover
its
not
really
that
great
a
pale
ale
oone
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
lately
the
tastes
are
smooth
and
clean
this
is
the
second
one
ive
had
and
both
disappeared
way
too
quickly
it
wont
leave
a
lasting
impression
but
youll
enjoy
it
while
youre
drinking
it
singer
finger
white

on
a
hazy
golden
with

aroma
is
nice
but
faint
sweet
juniper
aroma
with
a
slight
almost

is
mildly

with
a
subtle
nobel
hop
musty
almost
wet

light

moderate

if

beers
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrains
and
some
slight
herbal
juniper
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrains
up
front
with
a
finish
that
has
hints
of
herbal
flavors
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
juniper
that
is
supposedly
in
this
one
does
not
stand
out
very
much
o
a
very
differnt
style
of
pale
ale
but
just
average
for
me
there
are
better
ones
out
there
by
far
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
as
the
six
pack
is
pretty
pricey
what
is
left
is
the
base
pale
ale
and
while
this
base
is
not
bad
it
really
needs
that
juniper
to
make
it
one
i
would
want
to
return
to
it
again
overall
its
a
alright
beer
but
its
really
nothing
too
special
even
with
juniper
berries
its
refreshing
but
thats
all
i
can
say
of
what
is
an
otherwise
average
tasting
beer
overall
a
unique
brew
that
would
be
worth
trying
again
next
season
o
a
gentle
earthy
plantlike
pale
ale
with
some
added
fruity
sweetness
and
spice
still
had
body
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
odd
but
this
could
be
a
great
beer
for
an
occasion
or
food
pairing
or
even
to
throw
at
someone
who
typically
prefers
wine
or
sugary
cocktails
maybe
this
could
act
as
a
gateway
beer
d
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
not
really
worth
seeking
in
particular
more
on
the
apa
side
of
that
and
a
herbed
beer
like
i
stated
above
wouldnt
hate
more
juniper
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
drinkable
for
sure
but
leaves
me
longing
more
overall
this
was
a
disappointing
effort
from
rouge
plenty
of
citrus
notes
lemon
rind
most
notably
and
of
course
juniper
the
taste
however
was
too
dry
and
left
almost
nothing
on
my
taste
buds
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
really
watery
even
for
a
spiced
beer
it
is
quite
refreshing
however
and
the
smell
is
pleasant
this
is
the
sort
of
spiced
beer
that
could
have
worked
on
a
hot
summer
day
except
for
the
juniper
christmastreelike
aftertaste
not
bad
but
disappointing
considering
rouge
has
put
out
some
great
stuff
juniper
pale
ale
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
into
my
snifter
only
a
sliver
of
an
offwhite
head
which
disappears
completely
within
a
minute
average
to
below
average
lacing
for
this
brew
the
nose
is
mainly
lemon
pineapple
hops
and
malt
theres
an
earthyness
to
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
fairly
underwhelming
i
get
the
hops
but
beyond
that
not
much
its
also
so
dry
that
i
cant
really
get
much
the
flavors
evaporate
off
your
tongue
so
fast
i
cant
identify
them
the
earthylemon
quality
is
still
there
in
the
taste
as
well
feel
is
super
thin
and
way
too
dry
overall
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
cheers
o
has
a
nice
bitterness
for
a
pale
ale
the
juniper
berries
are
a
nice
little
touch
in
the
finish
nothing
extraordinary
even
for
a
pale
overall
nice
beer
good
bitter
flavours
overall
a
good
ale
but
i
expected
more
juniper
in
this
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
is
sure
to
please
any
rogue
fan
this
brew
is
a
good
companion
for
a
lake
superior
whitefish
broiled
with
fresh
herbs
and
lime
although
i
would
not
feel
the
need
to
seek
it
out
too
frequently
and
thus
concludes
my
first
beer
review
on
this
site
o
yeah
this
is
pathetic
i
hate
beer
that
is
not
tasty
i
hate
beer
even
more
that
is
not
even
close
to
its
labels
indication
in
a
personal
shocker
i
can
say
that
i
dont
give
a
schlitz
for
rogue
juniper
pale
ale
its
about
as
rogue
as
john
mccain
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
soft
hop
flavor
that
worked
well
with
the
berries
taste
is
very
hoppy
the
juniper
berries
come
through
a
little
on
the
back
end
although
is
seems
like
the
hops
slightly
overpower
everything
else
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
well
balanced
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
more
i
would
recommend
it
at
least
to
try
once
o
rogues
juniper
pale
ale
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
an
odd
beer
but
a
fairly
good
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
when
i
picked
up
a
single
12
oz
bottle
the
presence
of
juniper
berries
are
delighting
enough
for
a
person
to
at
least
try
this
experience
its
a
very
odd
and
unique
style
of
brew
and
to
me
this
is
what
rogue
set
out
to
do
create
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
unique
thats
what
theyve
done
with
this
not
world
class
but
its
still
pretty
good
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
rogue
offering
but
its
worth
a
shot
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
august
25
2011
the
pour
is
an
above
average
golden
yellow
with
long
simmering
fizzy
white
head
and
delicate
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
nose
there
are
a
few
malts
a
few
hops
and
a
little
grass
with
a
stronger
berry
element
the
body
was
in
the
medium
range
and
very
comfortable
for
the
style
the
taste
does
embellish
the
bittersweet
berries
and
they
mix
with
your
basic
pale
ale
malthop
character
decent
enough
the
taste
is
a
pale
ale
slight
malts
up
front
biscuit
with
a
slight
drying
finish
the
taste
of
juniper
comes
in
but
it
is
very
light
d
its
quite
drinkable
but
would
i
actually
want
another
well
its
better
than
a
lot
of
other
choices
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
not
something
i
really
see
myself
buying
again
overall
very
solid
brew
its
so
subtle
that
id
have
to
say
that
if
you
didnt
tell
most
people
it
was
classified
as
a
spiced
beer
theyd
never
know
the
difference
thinking
it
was
a
uniquely
hopped
pale
ale
very
drinkable
though
if
i
hadnt
been
told
up
front
about
the
juniper
i
would
have
assumed
it
was
just
the
hop
variety
serving
type
bottle
this
ale
was
a
great
choice
for
me
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
isnt
too
heavy
and
has
a
really
clean
finish
i
highly
suggest
this
choice
im
not
big
on
the
real
hoppy
stuff
but
i
do
want
to
taste
it
this
was
perfect
for
that
like
i
said
it
was
had
a
clean
finish
and
was
very
refreshing
the
place
i
was
at
had
alot
of
taps
and
many
more
i
wanted
to
try
but
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
one
i
had
3
and
was
completely
satisfied
just
having
tasted
this
one
d
very
good
drinking
pale
interesting
and
unique
but
not
overwhelming
or
a
novelty
from
a
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
rather
cloudy
golden
color
with
an
orange
tinge
aroma
is
floral
strong
unmistakable
flavor
of
juniper
berries
stopping
just
short
of
too
much
the
juniper
adds
a
bitterness
much
sharper
than
the
34
ibus
would
suggest
but
this
actually
makes
the
beer
taste
very
clean
almost
refrshing
strong
malt
presence
balances
this
out
nicely
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
nice
spicy
pale
ale
i
could
drink
all
day
o
interesting
juniper
beer
well
balanced
and
the
addition
of
the
juniper
berries
makes
it
an
extreme
beer
overall
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
drinks
like
an
ipa
with
a
touch
of
juniper
which
adds
a
nice
kick
to
the
the
taste
id
buy
this
beer
again
m
thin
body
with
a
juicy
quenching
finish
uncharacteristic
for
an
ipa
good
carbonation
i
doubt
if
this
review
will
be
the
highest
rating
ive
given
to
a
rogue
beer
but
id
say
this
is
the
most
interesting
thing
ive
had
from
the
brewery
so
far
id
buy
it
again
interesting
taste
light
to
medium
body
with
a
small
hop
hit
in
the
middle
and
then
not
much
else
with
the
hops
a
berry
bitterness
is
noticeable
throughout
the
taste
and
even
into
the
aftertaste
which
i
have
to
say
is
different
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
bitter
like
a
berrys
rind
actually
which
never
having
a
juniper
berry
before
i
can
only
assume
is
the
juniper
its
unique
at
the
very
least
and
i
do
give
it
credit
for
that
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
yet
still
enjoyable
for
the
complexities
of
the
berries
and
floral
hop
combination
the
mouthfeel
is
quick
clean
and
dry
lending
itself
to
the
style
nicely
the
hops
actually
come
through
more
and
more
throughout
the
beer
but
they
never
take
over
they
instead
take
a
seat
on
the
side
and
let
the
other
flavors
do
the
work
which
is
a
plus
for
the
style
all
told
im
enjoying
the
easiness
and
yet
thoughfulness
in
the
balance
of
this
one
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
left
me
completely
bummed
the
pour
was
decent
with
golden
colored
liquid
accompanied
by
a
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
really
didnt
give
me
any
reason
to
believe
there
was
any
juniper
in
there
the
taste
was
kind
of
on
the
typical
ale
flavor
side
with
not
too
much
else
really
jumping
out
at
us
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
a
bit
heavier
than
some
ales
but
not
by
much
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
better
luck
next
time
i
guess
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
terribly
exciting
either
theres
a
little
malt
in
the
flavor
which
works
well
with
the
pine
flavors
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
different
o
there
is
nothing
life
altering
about
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
enjoyable
i
may
not
revisit
this
soon
but
ill
probably
purchase
this
again
it
goes
go
down
really
really
i
mean
really
easy
so
for
a
hot
day
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
pick
up
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
ever
since
i
saw
it
at
greens
in
atlanta
back
in
march
as
im
a
gin
lover
and
im
pleased
with
it
it
has
a
nice
taste
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
ill
be
keeping
my
fridge
stocked
with
this
one
but
id
drink
it
again
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
d
the
bitterness
maybe
astringency
is
tingly
on
the
tongue
an
easy
drinking
light
pale
ale
overall
its
a
hot
day
in
ny
and
this
beer
satisfies
drinkable
enough
to
enjoy
when
needing
a
cool
refresher
and
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
i
think
the
brothers
said
it
best
a
good
conversation
beer
however
lets
be
real
here
i
cannot
write
it
off
as
the
best
of
anything
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
a
must
try
for
junipergin
lovers
would
go
nice
with
game
or
as
a
sauce
with
game
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
with
a
nice
refreshing
hop
bitterness
unlike
some
spiced
beers
the
juniper
berries
are
subtle
but
play
a
nice
role
a
good
drinker
very
pleasant
solid
ale
made
to
drink
at
nearly
any
hour
ive
had
tastier
beer
before
yet
this
beer
put
me
in
a
good
mood
during
lunchtime
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
hop
the
glass
is
ringed
from
top
to
bottom
with
white
foam
head
meaning
it
was
freshy
fresh
nice
o
this
was
pretty
good
ive
always
passed
on
it
in
liquor
stores
but
it
was
worth
a
try
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
yellowish
head
it
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
like
any
other
ipa
to
be
honest
after
having
other
beers
brewed
with
juniper
berries
dfh
sahtea
gsb
sleigh
ryed
i
was
expecting
the
juniper
berries
to
come
through
a
bit
more
its
still
really
good
for
a
pale
ale
though
and
i
do
enjoy
it
d
very
nice
pale
ale
rogue
does
a
nice
job
this
is
a
solid
brew
give
it
a
go
you
will
be
happy
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
with
ease
drinkability
nice
balanced
ale
with
plenty
of
complexity
but
very
refreshing
and
definitely
drinkable
herbel
bite
up

a
little
spicy
sappy
and
earthy
grainy
malt

okay
but
not
brilliant
drinkability
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
an
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
one
this
one
definitely
leans
more
towards
malt
as
opposed
to
hops
but
it
has
a
very
unique
character
d
possibly
the
most
drinkable
ipa
for
me
i
feel
like
someone
took
a
bells
twohearted
ale
and
dropped
a
few
berries
in
it
and
now
im
drinking
it
delicious
d
i
got
a
6
pack
and
i
have
had
2
i
will
probably
have
another
but
i
am
not
craving
it
it
is
good
but
nothing
that
id
make
a
night
of
drinking
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
though
sidenote
what
the
hell
is
free
range
coastal
water
is
that
worthy
of
advertisement
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
like
straw
huge
white
head
you
can
really
smell
the
juniper
along
with
herbal
hops
and
a
bit
of
honey
i
can
taste
what
i
smell
very
balanced
and
mellow
with
a
dry
finish
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
yummy
beer
but
the
dryness
hinders
session
ability
another
good
beer
by
rogue
moderate
alcohol
and
no
offensive
hoppy
bite
make
this
a
pretty
smooth
drinking
beer
notes
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
very
heavy
woody
pine
sap
character
but
found
a
well
balanced
and
interesting
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
the
pale
ale
taste
is
supplemented
by
juniper
rather
than
allowing
the
supporting
role
to
take
over
drinkability
a
unique
and
funtodrink
pale
ale
the
addition
of
the
juniper
gives
this
beer
a
nice
kick
to
it
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
your
typical
pale
ale
id
procrastinated
in
having
this
beer
and
am
disappointed
that
i
did
say
what
you
will
about
rogue
as
a
whole
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
in
my
book
poured
a
2
head
which
took
awhile
but
dissipated
completely
hazy
straw
yellow
smell
of
malt
taste
was
strong
lager
with
a
pretty
crisp
finish
they
say
juniper
was
used
in
the
making
and
id
kind
of
expected
hints
of
gin
in
it
but
if
the
labelled
hadnt
said
juniper
id
have
never
known
my
initial
pour
created
just
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
an
earthy
characteristic
less
floral
as
noted
on
the
bottle
and
more
herbal
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
peppery
blast
of
spiciness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
as
advertised
dry
and
spicy
mmmm
lets
see
how
i
feel
about
it
after
a
bombers
worth
all
to
myself
but
i
would
say
that
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
if
not
something
for
an
occasional
drink
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
but
i
dont
think
id
really
want
to
i
would
lilt
it
to
have
a
bit
more
flavor
and
punch
to
it
d
i
do
not
think
that
this
would
beer
i
would
drink
again
enjoyed
about
the
whole
glass
and
thats
a
fine
taste
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
though
its
on
the
lighter
side
and
satisfyingly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
also
pretty
high
at
the
very
least
this
still
remains
somewhat
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
disappointing
beer
from
rogue
i
cant
really
call
it
a
bad
beer
it
just
lacks
flavors
an
amped
up
formula
here
would
be
appreciated
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
sort
of
pricey
for
what
it
is
nevertheless
definitely
worth
trying
and
ill
likely
get
it
again
at
some
point
well
balanced
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
bitter
piney
flavor
medium
body
smooth
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
lacking
almost
everywhere
i
dont
think
id
bother
with
it
again
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangegold
color
with
a
sparse
foamy
head
about
half
an
inch
on
pour
that
disappears
as
i
write
this
not
sure
if
i
was
expecting
a
nose
full
of
gin
smells
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
subtle
aromas
flowery
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
juniper
absolutely
comes
through
on
the
taste
and
actually
overpowers
any
taste
of
hops
it
has
a
weird
dynamic
of
being
flowery
and
sour
at
the
same
time
and
that
doesnt
necessarily
blend
all
that
well
together
there
is
also
a
note
of
roasted
barley
somewhere
deep
down
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
dry
and
a
bit
harsh
in
mouth
with
a
sour
aftertaste
rough
on
the
finish
this
might
be
a
tough
bomber
to
polish
off
very
bubbly
with
a
great
tingling
of
the
citruses
has
the
dry
berrie
feel
to
it
verdict
juniper
pale
ale
is
a
cheery
little
beer
but
ultimately
pretty
forgettable
the
aroma
was
pretty
promising
but
the
flavor
ended
up
being
a
little
too
muddled
and
boring
d
great
hop
character
but
the
bitterness
slows
you
way
down
d
it
is
defiantly
a
drinkable
beer
only
disappointment
was
the
lack
of
juniper
flavour
but
over
all
pretty
average
wouldnt
class
this
as
a
spiced
beer
d
and
notes
very
sessionable
abv
with
good
balance
of
flavor
the
juniper
in
this
is
mostly
lost
on
me
juniper
should
be
very
aromatic
and
i
really
felt
like
i
was
searching
for
it
in
the
flavor
i
guess
if
its
in
the
name
of
the
beer
i
expect
it
to
be
more
present
a
solid
base
beer
kinda
like
a
hoppy
maibock
the
juniper
is
interesting
but
not
for
me
if
you
like
juniper
or
gin
give
this
a
try
d
very
drinkable
just
not
good
i
would
never
pay
money
for
this
again
i
had
high
hopes
since
i
love
gin
so
much
but
this
is
an
enormous
disappointment
more
proof
that
rogue
is
a
mediocre
overpriced
brewery
moreys
bottom
line
rogue
overcharges
for
their
beer
and
for
that
reason
alone
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
its
a
decent
pale
but
id
rather
have
stoudts
pale
troegs
pale
or
southern
tier
pale
and
theyre
all
available
in
my
area
and
cheaper
too
when
you
first
open
it
up
it
smells
of
hops
and
pine
trees
reminds
me
of
home
that
gives
you
an
idea
of
how
you
expect
it
will
taste
starts
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
then
brings
the
hops
to
attention
finishes
with
the
juniper
which
sort
of
hits
you
in
the
mouth
and
lingers
for
a
while
pours
a
golden
color
with
some
nice
head
that
leaves
behind
its
mark
when
you
drink
it
definitely
something
unique
for
the
craft
beer
enthusiast
pours
a
very
clear
very
light
golden
yellow
a
nice
white
head
sticks
around
and
to
the
glass
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
biscuity
malts
and
moderate
hops
the
taste
is
where
things
get
interesting
it
starts
off
tasting
like
a
good
mild
pale
ale
but
as
soon
a
nice
hoppy
finish
begins
the
feeling
turns
much
dryer
in
turn
the
juniper
squashes
the
mellow
finish
and
leaves
the
beer
feeling
flat
and
a
little
barren
kind
of
feels
like
i
chased
a
decent
pale
ale
with
a
shot
of
gin
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
brew
but
it
is
interesting
it
would
pair
well
with
some
sort
of
salad
my
dream
in
life
is
to
hook
up
with
my
friend
fred
savage
and
hitchhike
to
meth
mountain
in
oregon
because
not
only
is
it
a
beautiful
state
but
the
beer
is
divine
my
only
goal
besides
shooting
meth
would
be
to
take
the
rogue
brewery
tour
the
juniper
pale
ale
is
exquisite
reminding
me
of
how
much
i
used
to
love
sipping
hic
after
a
hard
day
of
water
polo
the
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
almost
copper
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
grains
and
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
a
hint
of
pine
to
it
overall
it
is
more
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
very
interesting
i
want
to
say
a
biscuit
malt
flavor
to
it
with
some
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
overall
its
interesting
and
impressive
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
this
one
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
lightly
malted
and
easily
drinkable
beer
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
hint
to
be
desired
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
d
nice
aroma
and
flavors
you
can
slug
this
one
back
i
had
a
several
of
these
at
the
bar
a
milder
looking
pour
of
orange
with
a
head
of
about
1
finger
the
nose
is
fantastic
though
a
nice
herbal
nose
of
musk
and
pine
that
is
something
of
a
hybrid
saison
and
apa
this
is
quality
deterred
by
the
very
one
dimensional
hop
character
the
herbal
note
is
the
only
thing
that
carries
the
beer
with
a
nice
quality
of
fire
ash
this
beer
is
gold
in
color
when
it
is
poured
it
has
your
typical
white
foam
head
the
beer
is
flora
in
aroma
from
the
juinper
berries
a
balanced
crisp
clean
malt
flavor
and
has
a
slight
spicy
flavor
and
a
heavy
dose
of
floral
junipers
at
the
end
easy
to
drink
drinkability
very
drinkable
aside
from
the
touch
of
dryness
at
the
end
decent
enough
of
a
brew
while
i
like
it
i
wont
be
rudhing
out
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
d
drinkable
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
or
desireing
from
a
beer
that
highlights
the
juniper
especially
from
a
brewery
know
for
being
strong
with
flavor
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
biscuity
malt
and
a
bit
of
piney
hops
in
the
aroma
or
is
that
the
juniper
light
to
medium
bodied
dry
malty
finish
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
i
really
did
not
get
the
juniper
at
all
subtle
to
the
point
of
non
existent
decent
base
beer
however
o
nice
beer
will
drink
again
if
found
again
in
my
hometown
no
d
the
juniper
pale
ale
is
a
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
at
any
given
time
but
i
dont
see
myself
spending
my
own
money
to
do
so
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
could
work
equally
well
on
a
cold
day
thanks
to
spice
or
a
warmer
day
thanks
to
the
lightness
and
hops
versatile
and
tasty
a
typically
drinkable
offering
from
rogue
overall
an
ok
pale
its
pretty
bitter
but
no
real
interesting
flavors
and
its
very
watery
just
doesnt
seem
like
it
can
be
called
an
extreme
beer
d
not
a
bad
brew
and
fun
to
try
especially
if
you
like
gin
but
i
expected
a
little
more
from
rogue
if
your
afraid
of
juniper
or
youy
have
previous
gin
nightmares
relax
d
while
very
easy
going
down
i
just
have
to
ask
juniper
for
those
unfamiliar
take
a
whiff
of
your
favorite
gin
thats
juniper
this
beer
is
a
nice
pale
ale
but
i
wonder
if
i
got
an
aged
bottle
for
those
of
you
worried
about
laying
some
down
the
most
i
can
say
is
that
if
the
juniper
faded
at
least
theres
a
good
pale
behind
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
extreme
beer
can
besimple
but
still
extreme
you
have
a
pale
and
add
juniper
berries
to
itright
there
the
brewer
is
thinking
outside
of
the
box
toss
the
turkey
to
the
dogs
a
juicy
glazed
ham
will
do
the
trick
for
the
holiday
pairing
if
not
for
the
pairing
it
is
at
least
a
good
conversation
beer
d
its
a
decent
beer
it
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
anticipated
it
to
taste
like
but
its
still
a
wellcrafted
beer
anyhow
it
makes
for
an
interesting
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
not
one
that
i
would
go
after
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
turn
down
poured
a
hazy
dark
copper
color
with
an
average
frothy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
floral
hop
and
small
malt
aroma
medium
body
with
a
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
spicy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
my
expectations
where
met
d
i
found
it
to
have
a
nice
mix
of
hop
bitterness
and
spicy
juniper
for
a
nice
take
on
a
pale
ale
milder
than
an
ipa
and
fairly
easy
drinking
d
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
juniper
adds
a
nice
layer
of
interest
that
kept
me
going
back
to
the
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
strong
spice
juniper
slight
wheat
slight
hop
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
herbedspiced
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
spice
juniper
slight
sweet
malt
slight
hop
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
very
strongly
spiced
as
far
as
juniper
beer
goes
its
the
best
ive
had
and
only
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
slight
haze
modest
head
but
still
some
residual
lacing
not
all
that
appetizing
nose
has
a
mixed
citrus
aroma
with
a
faint
resemblance
of
cantaloupe
rind
on
the
palate
theres
a
good
dose
of
malt
with
mixed
tropical
fruits
and
some
edgy
bitterness
nothing
much
to
get
excited
about
db
the
rogue
price
is
usually
pretty
good
as
with
this
one
a
decently
good
taste
with
no
real
offflavors
not
a
ton
of
juniper
it
is
hard
to
notice
just
a
semibitter
pale
ale
probably
wont
have
again
but
could
session
it
overall
im
super
impressed
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
so
good
but
its
really
a
nice
balanced
beer
im
thinking
of
making
a
beurre
blanc
or
a
mussel
pan
sauce
with
this
to
see
if
the
lemon
flavor
comes
out
more
and
what
that
minty
aspect
does
also
great
beer
cheers
i
do
not
like
to
see
this
beer
described
as
a
spice
beer
theres
nothing
spicy
about
it
hopefully
calling
it
a
spice
beer
isnt
a
deterent
for
those
who
are
curious
about
giving
this
very
tasty
beverage
a
try
edit
read
the
other
reviews
and
im
seeing
discrepancies
especially
in
regards
to
the
mouthfeel
so
im
guessing
i
may
have
gotten
a
subpar
bottle
drinkability
quite
a
refreshing
and
quaffable
beverage
the
overall
impression
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
d
big
time
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
aroma
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
taste
was
hoppy
and
fresh
but
nothing
overtly
juniperlike
very
pleasant
almost
reminiscent
of
an
amber
such
as
mac
and
jacks
very
drinkable
poured
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
then
earthy
and
piney
hops
behind
taste
was
similar
bready
up
front
then
piney
and
spicey
in
the
finish
well
balanced
a
bit
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
but
quite
good
to
pair
with
a
meal
very
drinkable
doesnt
really
draw
me
into
it
too
much
the
flavors
are
all
there
and
everything
but
not
blended
too
well
to
impart
a
great
kind
of
drinkability
i
find
in
some
other
pale
ales
given
the
fact
i
like
ales
in
general
and
enjoy
chewing
on
pine
needles
whenever
i
get
the
opportunity
its
not
too
surprising
i
do
like
this
brew
despite
its
drawbacks
definitely
worth
my
time
i
do
think
ill
have
another
d
light
and
good
for
a
warm
springsummer
day
especially
the
first
warm
day
of
spring
good
and
low
enough
abv
where
it
doesnt
get
you
going
too
fast
but
really
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
wanting
more
i
really
doubt
i
would
want
another
one
after
the
first
one
disappointing
in
general
i
was
definitely
looking
forward
to
more
pine
tree
in
my
beer
d
i
drink
a
six
pack
of
sierra
nevada
and
im
feeling
like
ive
eaten
a
big
meal
these
pale
ales
go
down
easy
but
leave
your
tongue
wanting
it
bit
more
just
to
say
its
not
too
heavy
but
has
a
somewhat
satisfying
taste
overall
this
isnt
bad
and
for
a
pale
it
certainly
has
a
whole
world
of
flavors
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
tried
it
you
cant
really
smell
the
juniper
on
this
rogue
offering
but
they
make
up
for
the
lack
in
smell
with
flavor
the
juniper
comes
out
in
the
finish
using
juniper
in
brewing
an
ipa
is
damn
innovative
and
scores
major
points
for
creativity
i
usually
go
for
dogfish
head
60
when
looking
for
an
ipa
but
this
is
a
step
up
in
my
book
d
nice
crisp
refreshing
brew
good
all
around
but
i
still
cant
taste
the
juniper
thinking
i
might
be
crazy
i
went
and
grabbed
my
little
can
of
berries
and
crushed
one
between
my
fingers
side
by
side
smelling
the
fingers
of
one
hand
and
tasting
this
beer
with
the
other
and
still
nothing
i
dig
a
good
martini
and
i
keep
these
berries
cuz
i
like
the
flavor
with
saurkraut
so
id
like
to
think
i
could
percieve
the
juniper
in
the
beer
but
i
just
cant
i
know
its
in
there
i
just
think
it
blends
in
too
much
with
the
hops
to
be
noticed
great
allaround
pale
ale
though
drinkability
i
will
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
i
have
a
chance
but
this
is
a
one
at
a
time
beer
this
is
fair
in
the
drinkability
area
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
medicinal
and
if
you
dont
like
juniper
berries
its
not
for
you
the
hops
make
it
worthwhile
finally
i
appreciate
the
brewers
ability
to
incorporate
a
respectable
amount
of
alcohol
hp
into
a
pretty
unassuming
package
like
a
geo
metro
with
a
v6
d
not
familiar
with
the
herbedspiced
beer
style
but
certainly
not
representative
of
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pale
ale
mediocre
at
best
slainte
notes
i
reviewed
this
using
the
american
pale
ale
as
the
style
guide
with
the
understanding
that
the
brewers
believe
that
it
is
a
herbedspiced
beer
i
dont
extremely
enjoy
rogues
offerings
but
this
beer
tastes
how
it
should
watery
but
quite
nice
again
while
i
accept
this
is
not
by
any
means
a
world
class
beer
i
quite
like
it
and
if
it
were
cheaper
id
drink
it
quite
often
i
think
mostly
clear
yelloworange
color
with
a
big
full
foamy
head
that
stuck
around
and
had
decent
lacing
smell
is
interesting
some
citrus
hops
and
a
little
sour
fruit
from
the
berries
balanced
taste
but
lacked
a
little
something
vs
what
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
not
bad
but
lots
of
other
rogues
i
like
better
d
not
liking
bitter
pale
ales
without
a
range
of
spice
flavors
one
bottle
is
more
than
i
really
wanted
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
berries
taste
is
of
sour
berries
with
hops
not
bad
but
nothing
great
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
unspectacular
beer
kind
of
golden
colored
bubbly
smells
very
strongly
of
berries
taste
begins
sweet
of
a
wild
berry
but
finishes
with
a
strong
bitter
taste
that
ends
in
hoppiness
not
a
bad
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
popped
the
top
on
this
bottle
it
would
probably
go
very
good
with
some
boneless
honey
wings
it
goes
down
easy
enough
to
go
back
for
seconds
poured
into
my
samuel
smiths
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
gold
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
left
a
very
big
creamy
head
3
12
fingers
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
in
the
nose
i
get
hops
the
easiest
and
then
some
berries
and
malt
the
taste
is
hops
up
front
followed
by
malt
and
berries
at
the
finish
slightly
watery
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
id
definitely
recommend
this
beer
its
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
d
the
heavy
carbonation
and
bitter
aftertaste
make
it
a
nice
beer
to
sip
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
overall
though
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
d
a
littler
lighter
on
tongue
than
would
be
appreciated
but
very
smooth
and
refreshing
flavor
profile
doesnt
blow
one
away
rather
more
concentrated
in
a
few
well
picked
areas
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
is
both
my
first
juniper
beer
and
my
first
rogue
ale
and
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
rogue
beers
note
perhaps
this
would
work
better
if
you
used
it
to
cook
with
or
paired
it
with
a
meal
that
would
bring
out
certain
flavors
by
itself
however
not
too
enjoyable
tasted
like
a
malty
pale
ale
with
an
added
bitterness
from
juniper
berries
only
had
one
other
juniper
brew
and
this
one
pales
in
comparison
but
it
is
good
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
medium
carbonation
aftertaste
is
mainly
of
bitterness
from
the
juniper
berries
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
would
probably
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
little
like
blending
gin
with
a
pale
ale
an
interesting
blend
of
hops
not
aggressively
bitter
certainly
not
as
bitter
as
my
usual
preferencebut
with
a
pleasant
enough
muted
edge
a
little
thin
on
the
palatte
i
can
imagine
drinking
this
beer
poolside
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
popped
a
lemon
slice
into
my
second
glass
and
it
gave
the
beer
a
mildly
pleasant
sour
taste
like
a
mixed
drink
not
my
favorite
rogue
theres
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
onebut
id
have
another
should
the
occasion
arise
pours

the

gets
better
as
it

is
only
slightly
different

on

i
could

a

this

tasting
the
odd
flavor
may
grow
on
me
i
hope
so
but
i
will
never
seek
it
out
again
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
distinguish
this
it
beats
things
that
dont
try
very
hard
but
its
just
an
off
taste
maybe
it
will
be
better
very
cold
that
is
how
i
intend
to
drink
the
rest
d
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
to
split
a
six
pack
with
friends
but
i
think
the
unusual
floral
accents
might
get
tiresome
after
2
or
3
something
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
and
find
it
this
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
refreshing
and
the
juniper
is
not
at
all
overpowering

good
of
not
basic

gimmicky
idea
for
a
beer
that
rogue
seems
to
do
repeatedly

for
me
juniper
pale
ale
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
bit
hoppy
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
light
i
was
expecting
a
more
intense
hop
flavor
or
for
that
matter
a
more
intense
juniper
flavor
it
is
fairly
hoppy
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
in
the
background
the
juniper
imparts
an
evergreen
like
flavor
which
is
fairly
mild
much
to
my
satisfaction
i
cant
stand
gin
which
juniper
is
the
main
flavoring
and
i
was
almost
dreading
this
one
decent
worth
a
try
a
quite
enjoyable
pale
ale
the
guest
star
complementing
the
standard
bittering
tropes
to
produce
an
interesting
and
rather
drinkable
dry
beer
and
im
glad
that
gin
never
crossed
my
mind
while
i
made
my
way
through
this

brew
pours
an
impressive
nice
semi

colour

looking

then
settles
down
to
a

coming

on
the
taste
and
i
also
can
taste
a
nice
taste
of
the
juniper
berries
in
there
aswell
but
i
dont
find
it
overly
dominant
in
the
brew
just
nicely
paired
and
it
does
finish
quite
bitteroverall
a
nice
brew
that
is
easy
to
session
on
and
afterall
being
a
beer
by
rogue
im
not
suprised
pours
a
clean

some

hints
very
smooth

that
has
a
very
light
malt
base
followed
by
more
herbal
quality
that
cuts
through
the
bitterness
as
it
shows
the
juniper
is
revealed
mostly
as
the
grain
dissipates
the
herbs
and
hops
mix
to
create
a
light
crisp
finish
with
green
grassy
flavors
lingering
the
beer
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
the
herbal
and
green
qualities
of
this
beer
creates
a
very
refreshing
and
delicately
flavored
pale
ale
d
juniper
pale
ale
is
underrated
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
great
flavor
profile
its
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
good
thicker
than
i
expected
and
a
long
lasting
finish
thats
satisfying
bottom
line
rogue
you
make
very
nice
but
not
exceptional
beers
cut
your
advertising
budget
sell
these
beers
for
6
instead
of
8
d
very
refreshing
and
smooth
a
unique
and
successful
spin
on
the
pale
ale
style
d
this
was
an
odd
beer
for
me
you
have
to
give
it
up
to
rogue
for
using
juniper
berries
in
a
beer
there
is
definitely
a
spicy
hoplike
presence
in
this
beer
that
makes
it
likable
but
there
is
something
there
that
makes
it
unusual
for
me
yeah
an
odd
little
beer
but
a
pleasant
enough
one
it
just
jolts
me
in
odd
directions
so
it
keeps
my
interest
while
challenging
me
at
the
same
time
hazy
golden
with
a
frothy
eggshell
head
with
great
retention
and
plenty
of
sticky
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
piney
and
citrusy
with
an
herbal
quality
im
attributing
to
the
addition
of
juniper
berries
well
balanced
flavors
of
mild
citric
hops
pine
resin
and
dry
cracker
like
maltiness
creamy
on
the
palate
and
medium
bodied
finishes
dry
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
for
sure
im
drinking
this
from
a
bottle
labelled
yellow
snow
ipa
which
according
to
the
beer
advocate
is
an
alias
for
juniper
pale
ale
it
has
great
head
retention
smells
of
pine
juniper
i
guess
and
has
a
very
earthy
grassy
hop
scent
im
not
a
fan
of
the
name
but
it
is
good
beer
much
better
than
the
stuff
i
had
earlier
in
a
can
from
belgium
poured
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
34
head
that
maintained
through
most
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
a
hoppy
one
the
taste
was
lightly
citrus
with
an
almost
bitter
after
taste
that
was
odd
maybe
the
juniper
the
feel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
whatever
the
juniper
taste
was
it
was
not
offensive
not
sure
what
it
added
though
either
d
interesting
brew
with
the
addition
of
the
junipers
but
not
enough
top
wow
me
good
but
i
wouldnt
spend
the
high
price
to
try
this
again
this
beer
is
a
little
weak
in
the
aroma
but
certainly
a
solid
brew
plenty
enjoyable
and
quite
sessionable
overall
not
something
i
would
session
with
but
certainly
worth
a
try
i
suppose
it
is
drinkable
a
tasty
beer
for
sure
but
too
unbalanced
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
was
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
to
many
other
great
apas
in
the
market
tm
smooth
with
a
crisp
malt
and
mild
bitter
hop
taste
light
juniper
berry
flavor
mild
fruitiness
with
malty
sweet
light
carbonation
easy
could
go
through
a
lot
of
those
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
for
a
really
long
time
thanks
for
another
solid
showing
rogue
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
pour
appearance
etc
were
all
standard
pale
ale
offerings
while
solid
not
outstanding
the
incorporation
of
juniper
to
this
beer
is
tasty
and
unique
the
flavors
work
well
if
you
dig
juniper
that
is
as
i
drank
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
crisp
refreshing
and
fullflavored
for
a
pale
ale
i
really
enjoyed
how
well
rogue
was
able
to
work
the
juniper
into
this
equation
i
was
searching
for
this
beer
for
a
while
and
am
glad
i
found
a
bomber
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
highly
recommended
i
like
this
a
lot
glad
i
didnt
review
it
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
think
that
bottle
was
old
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
tornado
loaded
ms
day
ill
have
one
any
other
day
too
though
d
good
for
a
hot
day
this
is
a
unique
offering
from
a
brewer
not
afraid
to
experiment
this
one
is
a
success
overall
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
i
think
next
time
i
fall
upon
some
i
might
go
with
their
stronger
fuller
bodied
offerings
for
a
chnage
but
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
if
you
like
spiced
beers
and
rogue
or
you
want
to
check
out
the
style
more
try
this
beer
its
not
the
best
in
the
genre
but
its
a
great
sipper
or
introduction
into
the
style
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
rogue
why
not
try
it
d
as
a
gin
drinker
i
was
hoping
to
experience
a
lot
of
the
juniper
herbalness
but
it
was
absent
the
beer
still
tasted
okay
but
i
dont
think
it
highlighted
the
juniper
at
all
could
have
just
been
any
pale
ale
d
i
liked
this
one
as
the
juniper
berries
dont
overpower
the
beer
it
is
pretty
balanced
brew
throughout
it
wasnt
particularly
fascinating
but
by
no
means
offensive
i
found
myself
swilling
it
quite
hastily
the
juniper
does
not
stand
out
much
at
all
and
being
a
ginlover
i
was
rather
looking
forward
to
a
flavor
explosion
however
its
a
great
pale
ale
i
will
return
to
when
i
feel
like
dropping
the
dough
for
a
bottle
nice
drinking
beer
i
enjoyed
it
pours
golden
with
plenty
of
foam
nose
is
of
vanilla
or
something
to
do
with
baking
besides
yeast
hops
and
spice
seems
pretty
balanced
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
crisp
spicy
and
actually
quite
light
understated
malt
and
hop
flavor
juniper
is
somewhat
difficult
to
detect
although
its
in
there
somewhere
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
again
any
time
soon
not
quite
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
for
especially
for
someone
who
likes
gin
as
much
as
i
do
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
good
for
95
degree
days
like
right
now
4
5
on
the
soft
and
muted
side
moreso
than
would
expect
given
the
relative
dryness
the
hops
hang
back
to
try
and
let
the
juniper
take
a
leading
role
but
the
berry
might
not
be
quite
up
to
the
challenge
perhaps
a
little
dull
at
times
and
i
thought
now
and
then
could
use
a
touch
more
carb
but
still
enjoyed
this
one
an
easy
drinker
with
a
slight
twist
a
certain
german
character
from
the
malt
and
for
some
reason
i
imagine
drinking
this
from
a
stein
at
an
ancestral
family
reunion
definitely
evoking
the
old
world
an
aspect
of
the
brew
i
am
appreciating
more
and
more
as
i
near
the
end
of
the
bomber
just
read
that
its
5
3
abv
which
leaves
me
even
more
impressed
d
a
pretty
good
brew
here
not
fantastically
deep
or
my
favorite
from
rogue
but
definitely
a
good
session
d
not
at
all
unpleasant
but
not
enough
here
to
make
me
crave
more
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
if
you
want
some
bitterness
it
is
one
beer
to
go
not
the
most
bitterness
beer
but
it
is
bitter
rogue
juniper
pale
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
ale
with
a
thin
white
film
of
a
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
bright
fresh
spicy
aroma
that
carries
notes
of
hay
pine
orange
peel
dough
and
well
juniper
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
very
smooth
the
finish
is
so
clean
it
seems
like
it
vanishes
from
the
mouth
the
juniper
isnt
carried
away
at
all
it
provides
a
piny
flavor
that
blends
with
the
citrusy
hops
this
is
a
well
balanced
american
pale
ale
here
quite
impressed
with
my
first
rogue
highly
drinkable
offering
from
rogue
this
beer
has
character
to
it
while
its
not
my
favorite
rogue
i
certainly
would
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
good
but
not
sure
about
the
juniper
if
i
didnt
know
i
was
drinking
a
juniper
pale
ale
i
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
up
the
sweetherbal
notes
still
not
entirely
sure
i
wasnt
reaching
for
it
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
it
is
simply
a
decent
cream
ale
nothing
more
lighter
color
than
i
expectedyellow
and
a
bit
hazy
head
disappears
quickly
leaving
a
light
ring
around
the
edge
smell
is
sweet
and
slightly
alcoholic
light
and
sweet
with
understated
hops
the
picture
of
the
pine
needles
on
the
bottle
had
led
me
to
expect
a
pineyhoppy
exotic
ipaesque
pale
ale
this
isnt
that
its
subtler
tastes
just
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
wheat
beer
the
juniper
berries
i
think
thats
what
im
tasting
brings
a
little
funk
twist
works
well
paired
with
a
flavorful
meal
though
it
takes
the
role
of
a
palate
cleanser
more
than
a
standout
i
actually
quite
like
the
unique
character
imparted
by
the
juniper
a
decent
beverage
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
to
set
it
apart
at
first
i
was
worried
that
there
wouldnt
be
enough
juniper
in
this
beer
but
rogue
manages
to
use
just
enough
to
showcase
the
ingredient
and
make
it
tasty
to
boot
a
very
interesting
concept
and
they
managed
to
pull
it
off
this
isnt
one
i
would
have
regularly
but
it
would
be
nice
to
complement
a
meal
every
once
in
a
while
definitely
worth
trying
d
pretty
drinkable
but
the
strong
grapefruit
and
juniper
might
get
old
after
a
couple
of
these
this
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
recommend
giving
this
a
try
overall
good
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
pretty
drinkable
seeing
as
how
light
it
was
in
taste
not
bad
not
good
for
me
this
beer
is
missing
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
will
opt
for
the
yellow
snow
when
it
comes
to
rogue
pale
ales
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
thought
that
i
had
made
a
terrible
mistake
in
buying
it
the
initial
taste
was
hard
to
place
but
reminded
me
of
mint
and
medicine
after
i
let
it
set
for
a
few
minutes
i
did
warm
up
to
the
flavor
not
too
heavy
but
the
juniper
taste
seems
to
linger
for
a
while
at
least
ill
guess
its
juniper
as
im
not
sure
when
or
where
i
last
had
anything
with
juniper
in
it
light
body
had
a
huge
head
when
i
poured
it
that
stuck
around
for
a
pretty
respectable
amount
of
time
was
an
interesting
drink
glad
i
tried
it
but
no
interest
in
having
another
out
of
a
bomber
this
world
champion
pale
was
hazy
goldenorange
color
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
offwhite
foam
that
displayed
pretty
good
retention
and
very
consistent
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
herbal
hops
along
with
a
notable
spiciness
and
some
sweet
malt
behind
that
the
flavors
were
similar
but
nothing
i
was
immediately
stunned
by
the
balance
was
still
excellent
but
the
hop
profile
starting
on
an
herbal
note
which
was
also
reflecting
the
juniper
they
used
quickly
gave
way
to
more
citrusy
hops
followed
by
the
pale
malt
that
was
a
little
biscuity
it
was
however
also
sweet
enough
to
offset
the
hops
lightly
spicy
and
rather
dry
but
not
too
acidic
the
finish
was
pleasantly
bitter
but
not
biting
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
clean
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
excellent
very
very
sessionable
ive
got
to
be
honest
though
i
could
quaff
this
all
night
i
found
it
unremarkable
it
is
nether
a
great
apa
nor
a
great
rogue
beer
and
the
juniper
berries
were
so
understated
you
wouldnt
know
they
were
in
there
worth
a
try
yes
worth
a
repeat
no
easy
drinking
and
pretty
enjoyable
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
i
can
appreciate
its
character
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
fairly
quenching
if
perhaps
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
goes
down
easily
enough
mouthfeel
was
zippy
and
medium
bodied
some
slickness
after
the
swallow
interesting
but
not
one
i
would
really
seek
out
again
pours
medium
gold
with
a
big
twofinger
head
that
sticks
around
big
nose
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
hits
the
tongue
hard
and
stays
that
way
through
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
spoton
aggressively
hopped
and
very
dry
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
hazy
orange
with
a
tint
of
green
off
white
head
juniper
aroma
for
sure
dry
and
bitter
nice
effervescent
mouthfeel
kind
of
washes
away
weird
no
strong
aftertaste
maybe
gin
though
good
for
one
bottle
to
split
with
a
friend
the
juniper
started
to
wear
on
me
a
bit
too
much
for
me
a
bit
dissapointed
but
not
terrible
overall
very
good
but
not
necessary
my
favorite
ddrinkable
absolutely
but
there
are
so
many
other
excellent
choices
even
from
within
the
brewery
that
i
think
ill
be
reaching
for
something
else
next
d
an
excellent
session
brew
and
quite
unique
this
is
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
that
i
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
fast
with
some
good
lacing
throughout
the
smell
is
a
usual
rogue
with
some
malt
hop
and
spice
notes
the
taste
starts
malty
with
some
nice
spicy
notes
then
stays
malty
throughout
with
a
nice
bitter
and
dry
finish
the
aftertaste
stays
somewhat
bitter
and
a
little
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
in
flavor
this
is
an
easy
drinker
full
of
flavor
that
isnt
overwhelming
and
has
plenty
of
great
attributes
that
contribute
to
a
great
beer
this
beer
like
all
rogues
is
worth
drinking
another
great
beer
from
rogue
highly
recommended
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
dthe
juniper
is
subtle
enough
that
it
melds
enjoyably
into
the
beers
flavor
instead
of
overwhelming
and
drowning
out
the
beer
character
overall
a
good
not
great
brew
i
tried
this
beer
because
ive
been
looking
at
it
for
a
while
and
i
was
having
some
wings
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
pair
i
really
enjoyed
the
little
juniper
bite
in
there
it
was
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
went
well
with
wings
but
not
sure
what
else
id
like
it
with
this
is
a
beer
ill
have
once
a
year
in
the
right
situation
not
bad
drinkability
suffers
its
tastes
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
lot
of
this
at
one
sitting
this
is
one
of
rogues
better
beers
i
didnt
have
problems
with
it
i
might
go
for
another
one
these
a
growler
of
this
might
be
too
much
for
me
a
draft
pint
or
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
should
be
sufficient
one
of
the
measures
that
our
beer
club
uses
is
would
you
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
and
my
answer
would
be
yes
i
believe
this
brew
was
once
called
yellow
snow
in
20012002
as
a
celebration
ale
for
the
winter
olmpics
in
salt
lake
and
the
name
was
changed
after
the
olympics
i
could
be
wrong
either
way
it
was
a
good
beer
poured
a
dark
yellow
out
of
the
bottle
almost
like
a
light
honey
the
head
was
34
inch
and
nice
white
you
could
smell
the
junipers
and
the
taste
was
evident
floral
and
citrousy
worth
a
try
for
sure
poura
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
great
two
finger
off
white
head
decent
lacing
has
a
very
strong
aroma
a
lot
of
berries
malt
hops
pine
and
citrus
has
a
decent
taste
but
nothing
astounding
almost
tastes
like
its
watered
down
with
a
hint
of
malt
at
the
end
definitely
not
at
the
top
or
even
middle
of
the
charts
has
a
great
aroma
but
no
taste
to
follow
easy
drinkability
but
nothing
to
the
mouthfeel
cheers
pours
a
clear
orangy
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
rich
malty
spicy
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
is
quite
appetizing
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
and
surprisingly
hoppy
more
so
than
the
aroma
suggests
texture
is
pleasingly
smooth
d
very
easy
to
drink
will
probably
get
again
when
i
see
it
very
carbonated
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
light
hop
aftertaste
very
drinkable
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
a
rogue
in
my
experience
overally
a
very
good
brew
to
get
into
the
american
craft
beers
it
gives
that
hoppiness
that
seems
to
be
what
the
americans
are
all
about
but
its
not
overly
harsh
a
fantastic
pale
ale
that
has
thus
far
put
most
of
the
australian
efforts
to
shame
from
just
a
glassful
of
it
drinkability
a
surprisingly
unenjoyable
beer
not
much
at
all
going
on
here
not
that
anything
was
offensive
just
very
bland
give
it
a
try
if
you
must
but
i
likely
wont
be
havin
it
again
i
like
it
though
it
is
hard
for
me
to
get
and
i
wont
likely
search
it
out
again
found
this
ale
to
be
full
of
promise
on
the
aroma
but
somewhat
disappointing
in
the
taste
with
the
astringency
of
the
hops
removing
any
hope
of
a
rewarding
complex
and
floral
taste
overall
an
ok
beer
but
for
sessionability
it
is
best
to
followe
it
with
something
slightly
more
balanced
this
was
an
easy
pint
to
drink
refreshing
and
fairly
well
put
together
d
kind
of
underwhelming
juniper
isnt
leaving
much
of
an
impression
fwiw
a
nice
drinkable
beer
though
d
very
drinkable
dont
know
if
i
would
order
it
again
left
me
wanting
more
flavor
22

pours
semi
cloudy

a
nice
looking
loose

then
goes

then
moderate
interest
here
one
of
the
huge
line
of
ba
worthy
rogue
offerings
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
the
advertised
juniper
which
would
have
been
nice
worth
a
try
but
nothing
too
special
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
23
cm
of
white
fluffy
head
that
is
slowly
diminishing
aroma
of
weed
more
so
than
hops
initial
flavor
is
sweet
almost
sugar
sweet
flavor
changes
quickly
to
a
dry
hoppy
bitter
floral
flavor
that
has
a
long
aftertaste
light
to
medium
body
limited
carbonation
light
lacing
and
slight
alcohol
presence
overall
on
par
with
rogue
beers
but
one
of
their
weaker
beers
interesting
brew
from
rogue
what
else
is
new
rogue
is
typically
hit
or
miss
for
me
although
this
one
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
d
very
drinkable
able
to
finish
the
whole
bomber
with
no
problem
and
would
gladly
go
back
for
more
the
beer
smells
a
bit
like
a
lager
sweet
malt
backbones
pretty
much
no
hops
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
head
and
dark
golden
colour
the
beer
is
really
fruity
and
the
junipers
come
out
to
the
end
there
is
also
a
bit
of
bitterness
pretty
balanced
beer
pretty
average
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
decently
drinkable
pours
a
darker
golden
not
quite
red
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
two
finger
head
nice
lacing
marking
ewach
sip
the
smell
definately
carries
more
juniper
than
the
taste
lending
a
sweeter
smell
taste
is
expected
plae
ale
flavors
strong
hops
grains
and
malt
very
light
in
the

feel
due
to
the
high
carbonation

a

a

with
a
small
fizzy
offwhite

aroma
is
mainly
hops
pine
and
a
hint
of
juniper

is
buttery
but
bitter
a
light
malty
but
again
mainly
hop
flavor
finishes
easy
decent
beer
rogue
just
makes
good
beer
drinkability
is
near
perfect
ok
it
doesnt
look
like
yellow
snow
thought
id
get
that
out
of
the
way
its
more
like
a
hazy
copperorange
color
aroma
is
sweet
and
what
i
thought
was
hops
the
flavor
however
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
finishing
it
off
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
d
a
nice
twist
on
a
pale
ale
i
prefer
darker
brews
but
for
a
pale
ale
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
the
juniper
played
nicely
in
the
background
well
balanced
and
im
not
sure
you
can
get
much
more
drinkable
excellent
sessionability
drinkability
i
probably
would
only
drink
one
within
any
drinking
span
it
certainly
is
an
acquired
taste
but
one
atleast
worth
trying
rouge
pulls
through
again
overall
this
beer
isnt
great
but
its
worth
a
shot
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
its
a
little
bit
different
from
your
regular
pale
ale
and
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
to
drink
but
there
are
several
beers
i
would
pick
first
this
was
a
nice
beer
which
ill
return
to
on
occasion
not
too
heavy
but
with
enough
taste
to
make
it
a
great
session
beer
i
just
wish
they
sold
it
in
six
packs
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
grilled
tuna
steak
and
rice
salad
wavacado
tomatoes
etc
the
fish
made
for
a
nice
combo
rogue
always
delivers
this
brew
is
fantastic
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
thick
and
fairly
well
lasting
head
the
bubbles
seem
to
find
permanent
residence
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
unusually
sweet
and
malty
for
a
pale
ale
once
on
the
pallet
there
is
a
distinct
but
by
no
means
overwhelming
bite
the
taste
of
the
brew
has
coolly
strolled
into
my
personal
top
five
casually
sweet
with
remarkably
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
this
beer
delivers
an
easygoing
flavor
that
is
just
too
good
to
treat
with
any
insouciance
with
a
mildly
dry
and
equally
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
one
can
easily
relax
and
enjoy
this
beer
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
with
no
regrets
d
hop
bite
in
finish
keeps
it
from
being
super
drinkable
but
thats
rouge
d
drinkable
and
tasty
nothing
outstanding
but
a
solid
brew
do
try
this
very
nice
and
enjoyable
real
quality
brew
good
for
something
a
little
bit
different
than
normal
while
still
mellow
enough
for
the
not
so
serious
d
much
better
than
expected
i
would
love
another
crisp
mediumbodied
and
refreshing
with
excellent
carbonation
this
pale
ale
works
very
nicely
drinkability
is
good
however
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
goes
quickly
my
suggestion
is
to
grab
at
least
2
or
3
of
these
babies
for
a
great
weekend
for
you
will
not
be
disappointed
poured
a
hazy
amberorange
color
with
straw
yellow
highlights
around
the
edges
two
inches
worth
of
foam
and
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
looks
nearly
perfect
smell
is
not
so
great
smells
like
a
typical
pale
ale
but
not
catching
much
in
the
way
of
juniper
berries
that
are
reminiscent
of
gin
taste
is
of
some
sweet
barley
malts
good
hop
profile
some
pineyness
hints
of
spice
and
juniper
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
dry
finish
light
carbonation
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
more
carbonation
would
make
this
one
zing
a
little
more

like

ales
but
this
one
i
would
probably
not
revisit
as
ive
had
better
much
different
from
a
ton
of
other
ones
nice
balance
of
bite
smooth
and
aftertaste
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
drinkability
easily
drinkable
when
i
saw
juniper
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
something
akin
to
gin
i
know
this
brew
is
vastly
different
than
something
like
gin
but
even
still
i
wasnt
impressed
by
the
juniper
and
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
pale
ale
a
really
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
the
juniper
berriers
but
it
was
more
of
a
complimenting
element
than
a
featured
flavor
drinks
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
d
average
at
best
drinkability
worth
a
try
for
something
new
good
as
a
single
and
to
try
something
unique
but
probably
wouldnt
need
to
sample
and
try
again
d
most
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
very
fresh
tasting
and
definitely
something
that
i
would
seek
out
again
in
the
future
nice
a
solid
beer
from
rogue
drinkability
is
good
for
the
hop
oriented
ba
this
one
comes
off
as
a
mellow
and
deceptively
smooth
brew
with
an
underlying
hop
quality
that
builds
upon
itself
as
the
tasting
goes
on
nicely
crafted
but
nothing
special
here
d
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
that
there
was
more
juniper
rogue
brews
some
big
flavors
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
was
a
bit
ordinary
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
fullbodied
beer
that
goes
rounds
to
a
nice
finish
and
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
drinkability
session
strength
and
body
however
the
hops
and
juniper
will
likely
be
fatiguing
after
more
than
2
glasses
smooth
almost
creamy
fullbodied
pale
ale
good
hearty
pale
that
is
pretty
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
superb
a
real
nice
brew
notes
i
had
this
brew
at
david
copperfields
and
it
was
oknothing
bombastic
and
nothing
to
reget
over
ordering
it
i
would
have
it
again
but
not
in
a
hurry
to
do
so
great
head
thought
it
was
maybe
overfermented
but
could
not
find
a
best
by
date
the
carbonation
was
overflowing
out
of
the
22
but
when
poured
into
glasses
it
had
about
a
one
inch
head
as
a
sidenote
this
beer
was
served
at
around
8000
ft
elevation
and
brewed
at
around
sealevel
nonetheless
this
was
a
delicious
american
pale
ale
from
rogue
not
quite
as
much
juniper
flavor
as
i
had
expected
though
with
the
price
of
beer
rising
and
this
one
was
five
bucks
it
was
well
worth
the
buy
but
only
for
a
try
i
will
usually
buy
based
on
pricepoint
and
this
brewery
usually
aims
just
above
my
line
but
always
worth
a
taste
of
something
new
and
interesting
d
a
nice
pale
that
does
not
go
over
the
top
with
juniper
yet
i
would
only
have
one
at
a
time
d
only
fair
drinkability
on
this
one
it
is
basically
a
pretty
standard
apa
but
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
juniper
berries
too
bad
i
had
wanted
to
like
this
one
pours
mid
gold
with
a
big
head
this
is
a
beer
that
reveals
its
charms
with
time
and
a
little
warming
up
the
nose
is
hoppy
and
slightly
piney
the
beer
at
first
is
a
normal
apa
with
the
tradmark
rogue
yeast
taste
but
after
awhile
the
juniper
comes
out
in
the
finish
as
dry
and
herbal
a
nice
drinking
beer
with
subtle
influence
from
the
juniper
d
all
on
all
a
note
worthy
brew
very
interesting
and
memorable
not
a
session
beer
but
one
i
will
enjoy
again
d
pretty
drinkable
i
got
through
the
whole
bomber
pretty
easily
quite
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
another
in
one
night
just
not
that
level
yet
a
fine
beer
but
nothing
that
id
keep
on
hand
i
havent
had
anything
from
rogue
in
a
while
and
this
one
caught
my
eye
pours
clear
amber
in
color
with
an
initial
big
head
that
hangs
around
a
little
bit
and
leave
some
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
with
some
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
some
bready
aromas
the
taste
starts
of
with
some
light
spice
followed
by
an
average
malt
backbone
well
balanced
by
hops
i
pick
up
some
light
juniper
flavoring
at
the
end
but
if
i
was
not
looking
for
it
i
wouldnt
have
picked
it
up
this
could
pass
as
a
session
beer
if
it
diddnt
only
come
in
5
bombers
some
good
but
not
overpowering
flavor
and
a
high
level
of
drinkability
drinkability
a
worthwhile
experiment
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
almost
completely
clear
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
very
faint
some
sweetness
and
very
light
hops
not
sure
im
getting
any
juniper
from
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
balanced
for
a
pale
perhaps
bordering
on
the
malty
side
noticeable
sweetness
and
light
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
towards
the
finish
with
an
overall
lively
crisp
mouthfeel
pretty
muted
flavor
overall
but
nice
and
very
drinkable
im
not
too
sure
on
the
flavor
of
juniper
but
i
didnt
get
anything
that
bowled
me
over
and
screamed
juniper
berry
nice
pale
ale
poured
a
cloudy
gold
from
a
22oz
bottle
not
a
lot
of
head
i
really
expected
this
beer
to
be
a
lot
sweeter
bit
of
pine
and
fruity
smell
taste
is
good
nice
hop
balance
i
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
my
self
but
hey
it
is
good
after
taste
is
a
bit
of
bitter
hop
then
nice
and
malty
but
not
too
malty
all
in
all
this
beer
is
really
good
will
buy
it
again
for
sure
although
would
be
cool
to
be
able
to
find
it
in
6
packs
really
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
good
job
rogue
i
like
it
this
large
bottle
went
down
easy
nothing
earth
shattering
but
very
pleasant
a
good
blend
of
hop
bite
and
smooth
sweetness
just
picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
perfect
pour
in
columbia
md
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
some
pinkish
hues
had
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
left
some
good
lacing
as
it
dissolved
has
some
nice
maltiness
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
spicy
notes
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
stronger
in
that
department
herbal
initial
taste
followed
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
then
finished
with
a
nice
malty
back
bone
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
clean
finish
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
session
beer
just
finding
it
this
one
time
was
a
big
enough
problem
nothing
im
crazy
about
but
more
than
willing
to
drink
this
again
poured
the
bomber
bottle
into
my
glass
and
received
a
dark
gold
body
with
a
twofinger
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
and
left
minor
lacings
a
dry
hoppy
smell
with
some
floral
aromas
and
some
citrus
to
it
also
but
nothing
too
descript
not
the
greatest
tasting
brew
but
it
has
a
fuller
citrus
flavor
from
the
juniper
and
there
is
a
nice
malt
mix
to
give
it
a
full
body
a
little
too
hoppy
and
dry
on
the
back
end
makes
it
a
little
less
smooth
than
it
should
be
but
it
goes
down
easy
just
a
little
too
dry
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
though
just
not
something
i
would
repeatedly
buy
d
a
delicious
pale
ale
extremely
drinkable
as
well
too
easy
id
like
more
juniper
and
theres
nothing
that
particularly
stands
out
about
this
one
but
id
pick
it
up
again
recommended
dnot
my
favorite
stuff
but
this
beer
is
still
delightful
a
double
deuce
goes
down
smoother
than
most
twelvers
and
its
enjoyable
thought
this
would
be
a
tryonce
bottle
but
weve
had
at
least
a
sixer
very
drinkable
and
not
as
much
juniper
considering
the
name
the
pretty
hop
aromatics
are
assertive
and
complex
would
make
a
great
everyday
pale
ale
if
it
was
local
one
of
my
favorite
rogues
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
pale
head
hopforward
smell
although
i
missed
the
juniper
here
the
taste
brought
out
the
juniper
for
me
but
this
is
a
hopheavy
beer
sharpness
in
the
mouthful
and
a
medium
to
light
body
overall
this
is
a
nice
the
good
nice
not
the
bad
nice
choice
in
terms
of
drinkability
different
and
worth
trying
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
object
to
but
theres
also
no
reason
to
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
one
d
for
hop
or
gin
lovers
this
should
be
pretty
easy
to
put
down
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
for
some
time
and
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
to
find
that
its
ginlike
character
is
not
as
intense
as
i
remember
it
nevertheless
this
is
an
unusual
beer
that
has
some
good
herbal
notes
and
just
enough
sweetness
in
the
finish
to
be
reminiscent
of
a
gin
and
tonic
a
good
but
not
an
aboveandbeyond
selection
from
rogue
their
juniper
pale
ale
is
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
and
is
very
crisp
refreshing
light
and
satisfying
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
copped
a
22
oz
bomber
from
garys
in
madison
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
minimal
or
no
head
and
some
visible
carbonation
smell
was
very
faint
not
too
apparent
and
i
had
expected
more
from
the
juniper
berries
that
were
advertised
on
the
logo
sticker
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
slight
juniper
berry
essence
somewhat
hoppy
with
a
strong
floral
character
pleasing
bread
and
butter
flavor
with
no
bitterness
detected
at
all
vanilla
and
lightcaramel
taste
with
a
pleasing
and
satisfying
taste
laden
with
quality
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
a
step
above
most
other
pale
ales
out
there
recommended
pours
out
an
ambercolor
with
a
thin
flimsy
white
head
and
minimal
lace
has
an
aroma
of
oily
hops
that
remind
me
of
melon
and
sycamore
trees
very
good
smell
tastes
incredibly
well
balanced
the
sweet
foundation
of
malts
stands
up
very
well
to
the
hops
that
taste
exactly
like
they
smell
the
beer
has
a
lightmedium
body
that
lends
well
to
enjoying
this
beer
through
the
night
another
solid
beer
from
rogue
d
very
refreshing
a
good
summer
or
spring
beer
not
so
much
winter
ale
drinkability
maybe
i
need
to
lighten
the
fudge
up
but
unless
the
juniper
berries
ever
decide
to
drop
by
i
say
just
skip
this
one
bartender
served
with
a
head
that
looked
more
like
lacing
dark
olden
in
colour
and
fairly
clear
the
juniper
flavour
seemed
to
get
lost
in
the
excessive
hoppinness
early
on
not
much
malts
and
it
finished
off
a
little
disappointing
to
be
honest
it
did
look
and
smell
nice
if
only
the
flavour
had
more
resembled
its
appearance
interesting
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
a
matter
of
personal
taste
i
like
my
herbed
fruit
oddball
beers
a
little
over
the
top
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
but
grading
within
the
style
it
loses
points
for
juniper
failure
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
very
nice
off
white
head
flavor
is
extremely
smooth
nice
crisp
juniper
edge
that
carries
a
nice
berry
tone
the
juniper
definitely
appears
more
as
time
goes
on
and
it
warms
nice
feel
on
the
mouth
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
sure
it
is
heavy
on
the
juniper
but
ive
never
been
opposed
to
having
an
interesting
ingredient
in
my
beer
if
it
provides
a
unique
drinking
experience
overall
just
ok
decent
ale
but
is
somewhat
watery
to
me
it
may
be
because
this
was
from
the
tap
but
i
will
definitely
give
another
try
to
distinguish
if
this
is
indeed
true
not
rogues
best
thought
it
was
worth
trying
because
i
only
see
it
about
one
month
out
of
every
year
and
it
seems
to
sell
out
pretty
fast
recommended
if
you
are
curious
but
not
the
best
pale
out
there
average
beer
that
did
not
do
to
much
for
me
overall
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
that
when
fresh
would
no
doubt
taste
much
much
better
drinkability
this
brew
is
not
too
shabby
at
all
im
not
really
sure
where
the
juniper
berries
come
into
play
but
something
is
a
bit
different
about
this
brew
another
pretty
quality
brew
from
rogue
drinkability
is
decent
with
this
beer
id
drink
it
again
if
it
were
offered
but
i
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
a
drinkable
pale
ale
but
average
the
juniper
gimmick
doesnt
do
much
for
it
i
think
this
is
just
a
barely
above
average
beer
i
was
expecting
a
harder
juniper
punch
to
it
but
instead
i
got
a
very
malty
and
middle
of
the
road
beer
i
like
that
the
aftertaste
is
this
mix
of
malthops
that
comes
out
at
exactly
the
same
time
giving
it
some
unique
character
ive
never
had
before
really
nice
snowy
head
really
light
mouthfeel
like
youre
drinking
less
than
you
really
are
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
its
worth
trying
d
not
the
worst
just
not
up
to
what
i
expect
from
rogue
as
nothing
really
stood
out
or
distinguished
itself
my
macro
loving
friends
thought
this
was
phenomenal
rogue
has
better
stuff
out
there
to
me
this
starts
out
like
a
fine
apa
but
then
tries
to
be
something
else
something
it
has
no
business
trying
to
be
and
rogue
just
misses
the
mark
with
this
one
not
impressed
at
all
the
initial
taste
is
barely
detectable
sweetness
followed
by
a
metallic
hop
burn
ending
with
a
spicy
juniper
berry
burst
not
too
enjoyable
almost
like
this
ale
started
out
as
a
good
idea
but
ended
up
loaded
with
probelms
im
not
going
to
waste
another
5
bucks
on
this
one
d
very
decent
drinkability
wise
this
is
a
nice
nw
pale
w
plenty
of
hop
flavor
and
the
juniper
is
hinted
at
also
the
balance
is
very
good
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
the
beer
has
a
considerable
bitterness
and
a
nice
sweetness
a
bit
generic
after
reading
the
back
of
the
bottle
i
discovered
that
some
of
that
bitterness
may
come
from
the
juniper
berries
theyre
noticeable
on
the
aftertaste
a
bit
spicy
there
was
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
would
go
good
with
dinner
if
you
happen
to
make
something
thats
a
bit
too
bland
for
your
tastes
a
decent
pale
ale
i
only
wish
the
juniper
was
more
pronounced
i
felt
that
it
was
barely
noticable
d
an
interesting
experiment
that
complements
the
apa
backbone
nicely
i
like
it
when
brewers
do
stuff
off
the
beaten
track
that
works
good
job
rogue
drank
this
ontap
at
the
rogue
portland
brewpub
poured
a
clear
honey
yellow
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
pretty
good
retention
im
not
sure
what
juniper
is
supposed
to
smell
or
taste
like
so
its
hard
to
judge
the
beer
the
predominant
flavor
and
aroma
is
honey
actually
a
sort
of
tasty
sweetsour
combination
some
herbal
elements
is
that
the
juniper
surprisingly
hoppy
on
the
center
of
the
tongue
with
a
distinctly
grainy
finish
appropriate
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
overall
easy
to
drink
just
not
that
amazing
im
not
gonna
lie
the
juniper
character
is
minimal
in
fact
i
would
never
have
identified
a
juniper
influence
it
sure
would
be
nicer
if
it
were
more
noticeable
as
that
would
make
the
novelty
of
the
whole
thing
a
little
more
palatable
i
would
say
there
is
something
i
dont
recognize
but
its
not
enough
to
make
the
beer
great
or
particularly
good
even
poured
out
a
nice
light
tan
color
good
head
good
lacing
it
has
a
great
scent
and
taste
a
nice
crisp
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
with
great
hints
of
juniper
although
its
listed
as
an
herbedspice
beer
it
reminds
me
partially
of
a
fruited
wheat
beer
except
its
a
great
pale
ale
in
place
of
the
wheat
beer
it
goes
down
quite
easily
i
could
drink
one
or
two
all
on
my
own
quite
easily
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
buttery
this
was
really
nice
to
drink
my
notes
from
that
evening
say
deliscious
it
went
down
quite
smoothly
with
a
nice
aftertaste
good
session
beer
but
dead
guy
is
a
better
choice
d
a
little
disappointing
i
will
have
to
get
this
again
when
i
can
be
more
confident
with
the
age
of
it
still
a
worthwhile
beer
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
offerings
nothing
crazy
but
a
solid
well
hopped
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
rogue
doesnt
really
have
an
ipa
they
put
out
regularly
but
id
put
this
as
close
to
an
ipa
as
anything
else
rogue
offers
a
definite
buy
again
a
nice
treat
from
rogue
a
little
bit
of
variety
this
nice
pale
ale
has
a
good
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
citrusy
and
piney
with
some
fruity
notes
that
i
imagine
are
the
juniper
berries
the
malt
also
lends
a
creaminess
and
some
caramel
aromas
the
taste
offers
the
same
notes
as
the
smell
with
more
complexity
fruitiness
maltiness
creaminess
caramel
etc
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
fairly
full
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
easily
sessionable
recommended
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
if
it
would
be
something
id
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
juniper
pours
a
cloudy
light
orangish
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
aromatic
it
tastes
spicy
and
the
hops
are
the
powerful
ingredient
the
mouthfeel
lingers
quite
sometime
my
wife
said
it
reminded
her
of
jubelale
from
deschutes
it
was
the
spice
added
that
gave
the
impression
it
is
a
good
refreshment
and
i
will
try
again
to
see
it
a
second
time
for
some
reason
this
brew
was
not
as
good
the
first
few
times
i
had
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
amber
with
a
decent
pal
ale
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
is
big
and
malty
with
some
nice
understated
hops
there
as
well
like
cut
grass
taste
is
a
little
thin
remember
being
a
bit
hoppier
the
hops
are
there
with
a
citrusy
spicy
bite
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
assertive
a
solid
brew
but
i
may
have
to
revisit
in
case
this
isnt
a
fresh
example
d
wellbalanced
pale
ale
with
nice
blending
of
4
malts
and
2
hops
alcohol
is
wellhidden
not
the
most
outstanding
choice
in
the
pale
ale
category
i
doubt
i
would
have
an
urge
for
a
repeat
tasting
this
stuff
would
be
great
to
bring
along
on
any
summer
outing
who
knew
that
juniper
berries
would
complement
a
nice
pale
ale
the
beer
does
not
appear
to
be
anything
noteworthy
it
has
a
really
pale
yellowly
appearance
but
appearances
arent
everything
this
beer
has
a
nice
combo
of
floral
and
fruity
taste
character
that
is
truly
unique
and
worth
trying
i
would
not
consider
this
an
everyday
beer
but
this
is
perfect
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
unfortunately
i
didnt
think
this
beer
really
worked
the
hop
and
the
juniper
seem
to
have
created
a
perfect
storm
of
astringent
bitterness
that
even
a
rogues
blend
of
malts
could
not
overcome
im
sad
to
say
i
was
disappointed
by
this
one
and
wished
id
spent
my
money
and
sobriety
on
one
of
the
other
delectable
brews
available
that
night
like
the
dryhopped
brutal
bitter
mmm
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
floral
hops
and
slightly
piney
tastes
nice
a
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
balance
i
not
sure
if
i
tasted
juniper
berries
since
i
dont
know
what
they
taste
like
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
and
goes
down
very
smooth
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
will
most
likley
buy
this
one
again
the
feel
leaves
a
film
with
a
nice
coating
a
bit
creamy
and
even
bubbly
not
bad
all
told
its
a
wellbalanced
ale
dry
but
a
little
bitter
and
a
little
sweet
pretty
good
indeed
d
the
disparities
from
my
expectation
made
this
interesting
and
refreshing
in
particular
the
forbearance
shown
by
rogue
in
the
level
of
juniper
was
an
uncharacteristically
subtle
and
excellent
decision
strange
brew
not
unlike
other
coastal
brews
except
this
one
showcases
northwest
hops
that
stand
up
to
any
lightly
heated
malt
interesting
ale
may
come
back
to
it
in
a
pinch
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
thin
but
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
juniper
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
between
earthy
citrus
hops
sweet
malts
and
robust
juniper
flavor
the
beer
is
rather
crisp
and
light
bodied
this
is
yet
another
extremely
enjoyable
beer
from
rogue
another
nice
brew
from
rogue
blends
the
juniper
in
well
with
an
earthy
bitterness
interesting
ontap
at
the
rogue
alehouse
in
portland
quickly
becomes
understood
pours
a
bright
gold
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
light
sweet
a
touch
of
juniper
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
big
malty
flavor
piney
juniper
flavor
is
definitely
noticable
and
rather
nice
some
citrusy
hops
are
also
prevalent
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
different
but
not
all
that
different
juniper
really
goes
fairly
well
as
a
flavoring
in
beer
pretty
drinkable
stuff
d
i
expected
more
from
this
rogue
beer
and
sadly
it
didnt
really
deliver
its
a
fair
beer
but
it
seemed
rather
bland
nice
session
beer
actually
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
sample
this
one
d
yes
please
ill
have
another
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
i
think
its
a
tad
to
sweet
to
session
but
its
fairly
drinkable
carbonation
seems
very
light
overall
its
okay
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
but
its
worth
a
try
dont
drink
and
review
i
was
pretty
dissapointed
in
this
one
being
a
big
gin
fan
i
was
really
hoping
rogue
would
put
out
some
kind
of
ginlike
beer
explosion
but
wow
did
this
fall
short
of
expectations
pours
a
urine
like
yellow
no
real
smell
slight
juniper
but
only
very
very
slight
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
not
overpowering
there
just
isnt
much
flavor
there
to
work
with
maybe
with
a
kicked
up
juniper
flavor
this
could
be
really
enjoyable
but
right
now
it
was
just
great
the
moutfeel
is
dry
and
a
little
slick
with
mild
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
hardly
a
juniper
beer
overall
a
great
craft
beer
pours
a
pale
hazy
copper
with
a
thin
splotchy
top
the
nose
is
of
honey
toffee
malt
sweetness
tropical
fruits
and
some
hoppy
florals
mellow
malt
character
and
ripe
fruit
start
but
a
bitter
astringent
hop
character
moves
in
that
is
metallic
and
then
ends
with
some
big
pine
flavor
as
it
warms
the
bitterness
lays
down
and
becomes
a
more
apparent
juniper
spice
and
toffee
malt
spruce
and
tart
fruit
notes
get
bigger
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
with
some
hop
tones
and
juniper
providing
a
boozy
gin
effect
medium
high
carbonation
and
an
even
mouthfeel
that
is
crisp
on
the
edges
taste
is
much
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
but
piney
resiny
hops
bitter
and
sour
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
its
strange
but
even
though
the
flavour
is
a
bit
awkward
it
reminds
me
of
the
pacific
northwest
in
a
big
way
wet
leaves
pine
forest
grass
earth
there
is
a
little
bit
of
clover
honey
sweetness
in
the
back
but
the
malt
presence
is
light
and
dosent
really
shine
through
much
taste
mellows
as
the
beer
warms
but
this
is
definitely
a
unique
one
not
offensive
just
different
mouthfeel
is
very
drying
and
light
bodied
not
a
heavy
beer
but
its
a
little
sticky
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
high
in
my
opinion
im
not
sure
if
more
than
one
of
these
would
be
in
order
but
its
not
a
dreadful
brew
very
unique
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
it
reminds
me
of
nature
and
all
the
things
my
grandfather
loves
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
strong
of
hops
and
a
bit
floral
the
taste
is
hops
bitter
and
the
juniper
berries
are
just
detectable
enough
to
add
some
interest
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
fits
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
id
consider
quite
drinkable
my
chef
friend
suggests
drinking
this
with
pastrami
d
gin
mixed
with
beer
thank
goodness
that
didnt
turn
out
to
be
true
still
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
really
shared
this
one
with
3
others
as
we
tryed
numerous
beers
that
night
and
all
of
us
like
this
one
drinkability
decent
d
this
beer
has
a
great
fresh
malt
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
big
and
onedimensional
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
very
refreshing
and
well
made
decent
and
easy
to
drink
out
of
the
ordinary
and
worth
advocating
not
really
d
the
slightly
complex
flavors
make
this
out
to
be
better
than
it
is
i
felt
like
there
should
be
more
to
this
beer
still
an
enjoyable
selection
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
another
one
anytime
soon
more
of
an
apa
than
anything
excellent
tasty
smooth
super
easy
drinking
beer
appears
honey
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
layer
of
thin
lacing
smells
of
sweet
bread
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
fruit
taste
is
yeasty
up
front
followed
by
some
citrus
a
hint
of
the
juniper
and
then
a
nice
sweet
finish
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
moreso
when
it
warms
up
easy
to
drink
though
not
something
id
rush
out
to
have
again
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
has
to
be
drank
slowly
for
appreciation
flavor
is
odd
sweet
with
the
first
impression
then
slightly
evergreen
from
the
hops
that
is
quickly
followed
by
a
granny
smith
apple
flavor
and
then
something
else
i
do
not
recognize
i
imagine
that
something
else
is
juniper
berries
however
i
do
not
believe
i
have
ever
had
a
juniper
berry
so
i
am
just
guessing
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
pleasing
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
great
beer
after
a
long
hot
day
working
outside
this
one
doesnt
go
down
too
quickly
for
me
but
does
get
better
as
i
progress
through
the
bomber
not
bad
but
i
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
poors
a
very
nice
clear
golden
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
no
lace
not
very
impressive
to
loook
at
really
smell
is
good
piney
hopey
not
very
strong
though
taste
is
very
nice
smooth
and
a
great
backend
to
it
has
that
nice
piney
grassey
hops
taste
to
it
fairly
well
carbonated
not
overally
so
at
all
though
this
is
a
great
session
beer
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
without
blinking
its
not
your
drop
down
fantastic
hop
explosion
by
any
means
but
a
great
pale
ale
it
may
not
be
too
impressive
on
the
eyes
or
nose
but
i
would
definatly
have
another
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
faint
very
faint
juniper
berry
and
crisp
pale
malt
finishes
clean
almost
no
finish
or
aftertaste
this
is
drinkable
but
very
disappointing
the
juniper
is
very
faint
when
it
could
have
shown
nicely
against
this
malt
profile
barley
distinguishable
from
many
light
pale
ales
boo
a
decent
pale
ale
although
im
a
little
dissapointed
that
a
beer
having
the
word
juniper
in
its
title
is
at
least
to
my
taste
buds
pretty
much
completely
absent
of
juniper
flavors
or
aromas
worth
a
try
and
probably
a
good
sessioning
beer
i
expected
a
little
more
tang
in
this
beer
than
was
actually
there
less
juniper
taste
than
anticipated
but
this
is
actually
just
the
new
name
for
yellow
snow
ale
which
i
have
always
enjoyed
no
recipe
changes
to
speak
of
just
the
name
alone
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
both
better
than
average
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
aroma
actually
contained
more
juniper
than
the
taste
which
was
mild
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
a
gin
like
flavor
much
like
gin
i
cannot
personally
tolerate
too
much
due
to
the
acidity
this
limited
the
drinkability
score
for
me
which
holds
true
as
after
one
or
two
pints
of
yellow
snow
id
usually
switch
to
something
else
those
who
favor
hopped
bitterness
should
really
seek
out
this
beer
i
just
wish
they
had
kept
the
name
hazy
sunset
gold
short
crackling
head
of
loosely
packed
offwhite
bubbles
of
mixed
sizes
slow
to
settle
eventually
falling
to
a
tall
collar
and
a
handful
of
scattered
dust
citrusy
floral
hop
aromas
and
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
floral
citrus
hops
lead
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
raw
bitterness
there
is
a
lingering
spiciness
in
the
finish
that
has
a
tingly
quality
about
it
and
is
a
bit
peppery
no
obvious
signs
of
juniper
berries
the
hops
are
the
main
flavor
contributor
the
finish
is
a
bit
drying
and
the
hops
linger
a
short
while
mediumlight
body
with
nice
tingly
carbonation
as
a
pale
ale
this
was
ok
but
i
could
not
detect
any
juniper
berries
which
was
the
reason
i
decided
to
try
it
in
the
first
place
poured
a
very
hazy
yet
goldish
hue
and
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
you
can
really
smell
juniper
smells
a
lot
like
the
forest
in
my
honest
opinion
very
good
hop
taste
that
is
very
crisp
that
is
really
not
to
overpowering
juniper
tastes
very
interesting
as
well
i
would
say
try
this
at
least
once
but
it
is
definetly
not
an
all
the
time
type
thing
drinkable
and
pleasant
would
definitely
drink
this
out
on
the
town
but
not
earth
shattering
also
being
a
fan
of
gin
i
wont
be
buying
this
brew
again
overall
was
good
but
nothing
special
aftertaste
hurt
my
scoring
of
the
flavor
i
would
not
have

i
really
liked
it
nice
aftertaste
nice
smell
good
all
around
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
really
enjoyed
and
would
buy
again
although
it
is
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
also
i
think
this
is
a
nice
idea
for
a
flavored
beer
that
is
subtley
flavored
and
not
overpowering
and
gimmickey
i
might
throw
some
juniper
berries
in
my
next
batch
of
pale
ale
i
am
making
and
see
if
i
can
make
something
similar
to
this
beer
d
i
was
looking
foward
to
this
one
hoping
that
the
juniper
would
add
a
unique
complexity
to
the
beer
nope
lots
of
better
pale
ales
and
lots
of
better
beers
just
like
the
bottled
version
feels
good
going
down
and
is
very
drinkable
i
wnet
back
for
seconds
and
if
there
hadnt
been
a
widmer
bros
stand
may
have
drank
this
exclusively
nonetheless
it
remains
a
very
refreshing
brew
from
rogue
that
pairs
well
with
creamy
pasta
dishes
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
alba
scotts
pine
ale
except
with
a
little
more
hops
more
hops
than
a
gruit
you
say
ill
definitely
find
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
to
take
up
to
the
cabin
on
the
4th
easy
drinking
firm
summer
session
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
definately
will
put
this
on
my
list
of
favorites
drinkability
this
beer
is
well
done
but
im
not
quite
sure
what
im
supposed
to
get
from
it
either
there
are
many
pale
ales
that
do
more
for
me
and
the
herbed
character
wasnt
especially
impressive
a
fairly
solid
pale
ale
all
around
but
that
extra
peppery
spice
of
the
juniper
on
the
finish
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
in
the
end
im
quite
content
finishing
this
bottle
but
have
no
huge
urge
to
run
out
and
grab
more
an
overall
average
beer
it
poured
into
my
5
l
rastal
stange
decent
amount
of
carbonation
puffy
head
until
i
took
a
sip
then
diminished
into
a
thin
film
it
tasted
like
an
i
p
a
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
of
raw
plant
nothing
special
about
this
beer
rogues
juniper
pale
ale
renamed
yellow
snow
ale
is
good
variation
on
a
pale
ale
recipe
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
all
the
main
aspects
are
in
order
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
but
for
5
50
per
22ounce
bomber
i
expect
a
bit
more
than
above
average
i
will
conceed
that
the
cloudy
nature
and
the
relative
flatness
may
be
evidence
of
an
old
beer
i
will
attempt
to
sample
another
bottle
odd
for
rogue
to
make
an
underhopped
beer
cmon
guys
wheres
the
west
coast
influence
by
the
way
what
the
hell
is
a
juniper
berry
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
gold
with
a
smallish
creamy
head
that
dissipates
in
what
id
call
an
average
period
of
time
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
disappointing
with
some
slight
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
all
that
seperates
it
from
a
very
bland
lager
taste
is
better
though
with
a
sharp
floral
bite
from
the
hops
at
first
followed
by
a
unique
bitterness
which
accompanies
the
sweet
malts
but
the
two
dont
quite
blend
for
me
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
first
but
gets
muddy
as
it
warms
and
drinkability
is
reasonably
good
i
sometimes
think
that
rogue
should
put
a
few
of
their
beers
in
smaller
bottles
and
this
is
one
of
them
not
bad
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
beer
ok
is
this
note
of
diacetyl
given
how
sensitive
i
am
to
this
particular
chemical
compound
actually
here
or
is
it
just
the
manifestation
of
the
juniper
actually
i
have
realized
that
it
is
the
combination
of
the
diacetyl
and
the
juniper
flavors
that
have
mixed
the
two
actually
form
a
spicy
mix
that
makes
the
otherwise
objectionable
diacetyl
all
that
much
more
bearable
and
actually
a
positive
contributor
to
this
beer
d
an
interesting
take
on
a
standard
pale
ale
indeed
although
this
beer
seems
to
have
been
lumped
into
the
spicedherbed
beer
category
the
alcohol
content
on
the
lower
side
is
nice
as
it
helps
to
keep
you
on
the
straight
and
narrow
should
you
choose
to
have
more
than
one
a
nice
springtime
drinker
even
if
a
smidge
rough
around
the
edges
mouthfeeldrinkability
more
than
moderate
carbonation
medium
bodied
i
feel
that
this
is
more
balanced
than
but
still
representative
of
the
american
pale
great
american
pale
ale
im
really
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
and
will
probably
pick
it
up
again
anyways
poured
a
dark
golden
body
with
a
white
head
about
three
fingers
wide
leaving
lacing
around
the
glass
as
it
was
slowly
consumed
a
faint
hopiness
and
a
little
sweetness
to
the
nose
hop
bitterness
is
mellow
and
doesnt
linger
too
long
i
cant
quite
tell
where
the
juniper
is
at
but
this
has
a
sweet
flavor
to
it
something
i
dont
associate
with
pale
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
a
little
fuller
than
most
beers
of
this
style
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
note
this
beer
was
very
good
for
a
beer
brewed
roughly
4
years
ago
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
of
the
style
there
is
very
little
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
almost
no
hop
aroma
is
present
the
beer
is
clean
but
dull
i
guess
that
i
was
expecting
a
more
robust
beer
from
rogue
no
dates
to
indicate
what
when
where
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
was
pretty
fresh
all
its
characteristics
were
very
lively
and
very
jumpy
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
did
very
much
like
this
beer
mouthfeel
a
little
sharp
on
the
bitterness
and
a
slight
hint
of
acidty
the
malt
makes
a
cameo
on
the
palate
mostly
bitter
and
citice
a
little
one
sided
good
dark
yellow
color
with
a
solid
head
with
nice
lacing
left
smell
is
much
that
of
a
usual
pale
ale
nice
crisp
sweet
malt
with
pleny
of
hop
tones
these
being
more
of
a
piney
and
floral
variety
the
taste
doesnt
really
hold
any
of
the
juniper
berry
qualities
too
strongly
if
i
wasnt
really
looking
for
it
i
might
have
missed
it
and
dismissed
it
as
hops
i
would
have
liked
it
a
little
stronger
to
really
display
the
juniper
flavor
it
has
a
good
body
and
it
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
just
wish
they
would
take
the
bolder
step
and
really
go
with
the
juniper
this
was
one
i
had
heard
about
and
never
had
the
opportunity
to
buy
so
when
i
saw
a
1pt
9
6oz
bottle
of
the
yellow
snow
i
had
ot
go
for
it
it
poured
copperorange
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
which
stuck
around
it
had
the
aroma
of
honey
and
malts
mild
hoppiness
virtually
nothing
else
the
taste
was
the
same
lots
of
sweetness
malts
and
mild
floral
hops
and
yeasts
it
was
smooth
and
crisp
but
a
bomber
of
this
was
almost
too
much
to
drink
by
onesself
at
the
very
least
it
was
very
interesting
and
i
once
again
applaud
rogue
for
branching
out
and
trying
something
i
hadnt
seen
before
and
havent
seen
yet
the
bottle
blurb
describes
the
beer
as
saffron
color
and
i
think
that
is
pretty
accurate
good
size
head
that
never
completely
disappears

leaves
some
lacing
sweet
bouquet
with
some
honey
and
a
touch
of
pine
underneath
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
round
malt
tastes
not
as
piney
as
i
was
expecting
hoping
given
the
juniper
berries
really
no
gin
character
perhaps
slightly
underhoped
still
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
round
and
soft
with
a
delicate
finish
i
bought
this
as
yellow
snow
ale
not
the
juniper
as
listed
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
with
a
nice
foamy
2
finger
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
a
very
strong
malt
scentnot
alot
of
spices
but
the
malt
is
huge
taste
wise
malt
is
the
king
this
whole
beer
is
about
malt
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
this
is
an
unsual
beerbut
very
tasty
ive
only
seen
this
onceso
if
you
see
itbuy
it
smooth
malts
and
strong
earth
hops
make
up
the
flavor
profile
with
a
light
juniper
element
accent
the
hops
finish
strong
and
spicy
i
like
this
fairly
unique
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
id
like
to
pair
one
of
these
with
a
gourmet
sandwich
or
salad
a
clean
light
amberorange
beer
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
and
some
lace
there
is
a
very
interesting
cereal
grain
aroma
with
hints
of
corn
in
the
background
not
what
i
expected
from
juniper
as
it
warms
there
is
a
light
floral
character
in
the
background
there
is
a
creamy
character
to
the
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
mostly
a
cereal
grain
maltiness
with
a
light
floral
bitterness
on
the
finish
perfectly
clear
copper
with
a
light
white
head
not
much
aroma
really
just
some
light
grassy
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
lightly
sweet
flavor
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
slightly
dry
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
refreshing
just
nothing
too
exciting
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
the
juniper
berries
are
evident
in
the
smell
juniper
again
dominates
the
taste
but
is
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
hops
but
not
overpowering
like
most
of
rogues
brews
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
has
very
good
drinkabilty
and
ill
buy
it
again
hazy

of

items
orange

citrus
hops

come
out

as
well

is
rather
herbal
and
earthy
with
orange
and
spices
coming
together
that
work
well
together
junipers
come
out
in
the
finish
and
last
into
the
aftertaste
i
like
how
the
flavors
go
together
in
this
brew
mouthfeel
was
mediumish
with
good
carbonation
almost
seems
to
be
a
full
bodied
beer
but
the
carbonation
sets
is
straight
solid
beer
and
perhaps
one
of
rogues
underrated
beers
da
very
drinkable
its
a
nice
and
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
not
for
the
hopped
up
american
drinker
id
say
but
its
def
worht
a
try
right
on
slàinte
pours
cloudy
amber
with
a
short
offwhite
head
looks
like
a
pale
ale
should
smell
bright
fresh
hops
upfront
backed
up
by
a
mellow
malt
sweetness
taste
nice
crackery
yeasts
upfront
followed
by
a
narrow
hop
bitterness
that
rapidly
turns
citrusy
even
juicy
the
finish
lasts
long
as
and
pulls
out
some
piney
accents
and
an
even
more
pronounced
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
clean
with
enough
weight
to
hold
itself
down
poured
into
pilsner
nice
vanilla

with
minimal

hops
the
taste
is
nice
and
buttery
maybe
caramel
lots
of
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
regular
mouthfeel
overall
nice
beer
its
a
rogue
what
can
i
say
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
prickly
despite
its
flaws
it
is
actually
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
probably
will
not
buy
more
but
i
didnt
have
a
problem
sucking
this
down
somewhat
hazy
gold
color
lots
of
carbonation
clearly
seen
streaming
from
the
bottom
head
is
offwhite
and
holds
decently
enough
leaving
bits
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
somewhat
musty
malts
with
some
light
spices
thrown
in
as
well
taste
is
actually
floral
hops
upfront
with
some
piney
spicy
notes
all
resting
on
a
dusty
malt
profile
typical
of
many
rogue
beers
the
juniper
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
other
than
try
and
be
a
purposeful
offflavor
very
clean
finish
and
smooth
all
the
way
down
not
a
bad
offering
from
them
and
an
interesting
pale
ale
but
ive
had
much
better
from
rogue
650

ginger
malty
flavor
but
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
from
the

strong

flavor
but
it
doesnt
completely
overwhelm
the
malty
sweetness
in
fact
this
beer
has
good
balance
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
flavor
perhaps
some
juniper
flavor
but
it
could
be
my
imagination
very
much
a
rogue
beer
in
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
rogue
the
juniper
pale
ale
was
a
light
slightly
transluscent
goldyellow
beer
in
color
with
a
half
inch
head
there
was
some
streaky
lace
it
had
a
nice
floral
bouquet
that
lead
into
a
slightly
sharp
initial
taste
that
led
into
elements
of
fruit
and
evergreen
with
some
malt
sweetness
the
evergreen
and
fruit
tastes
lasted
into
and
throughout
a
dryish
flavorfull
finish
i
had
this
beer
paired
with
the
gumbo
at
the
rogue
brewery
and
it
pretty
much
held
its
own
purchased
this
for
a
beer
tasting
under
the
title
yellow
snow
ale
which
really
caused
a
few
bits
of
laughter
with
the
crowd
paid
only
4
99
for
a
500
ml
bottle
a
bit
on
the
disappointing
side
for
a
rogue

this
one
never
screamed
anything

exciting

me

that
this

only
i
have

slightly
cloudy
color
with
a
good
amount
of

oddly
it
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
to
me
at
times
perhaps
because
it
is
extremely
smooth
but
i
could
be
crazy
ends
with
a
very
slight
bitter
taste
i
find
it
hard
to
taste
the
spices
that
i
can
smell
i
do
however
taste
and
smell
a
bit
of
honey
i
have
no
idea
what
juniper
tastes
like
but
apparently
its
in
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orangred
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
of
juniper
and
pine
with
some
fruit
peaking
through
the
taste
is
like
a
pale
ale
softened
by
juniper
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fraoch
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
brew
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
taste
is
malt
and
more
of
the
citrus
for
me
its
a
nice
taste
that
ive
enjoyed
many
times
before
and
ill
have
again
without
a
whim
good
pale
ale
d
id
have
to
rate
the
drinkability
at
a
later
time
for
sake
of
a
newer
beer
but
not
bad
even
as
such
the
taste
of
the
juniper
was
fairly
subtle
which
i
guess
is
a
good
thing
because
i
know
gin
is
flavored
this
way
which
i
really
dont
like
much
gin
i
mean
i
rated
the
taste
average
because
the
hops
werent
pronounced
enough
to
call
this
a
pale
ale
at
least
not
to
me
the
golden
yellow
colored
pour
out
of
the
22
oz
bomber
labeled
yellow
snow
ale
was
attractive
due
to
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
but
lasting
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
perfumey
with
a
hint
of
wood
the
taste
was
bready
and
sweetish
with
a
mineralized
buttery
flavor
typical
of
english
pale
ales
hops
were
earthy
and
spicy
and
the
juniper
berry
taste
was
not
quite
evident
until
the
sediment
was
poured
in
at
that
point
a
spruce
like
bitterness
crept
in
which
i
presume
was
due
to
the
herbs
used
mouthfeel
was
crisp
initially
but
became
much
softer
and
thicker
after
the
yeast
pour
a
very
sessionable
beer
far
superior
in
complexity
to
its
other
pale
ale
brethren
that
clock
in
around

abv
for
some
strange
reason
not
distributed
in
georgia
pours
a
hazy
goldish
orange
smells
of
malt
and
citrusy
hops
neither
one
to
excess
creating
a
nice
balance
tastes
of
a
faint
honey
sweetness
along
with
a
minimal
hop
bitterness
and
malt
smoothness
with
a
crisp
tart
bite
at
the
finish
different
from
other
rogue
brews
but
good
just
the
same
overall
a
decent
selection
from
rogue
but
i
was
expecting
more
not
their
strongest
brew
but
worth
a
try
nonetheless
average
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasant
drinkability
may
try
this
once
more
but
would
most
likely
go
for
another
rogue
offering
pours
a
deep
golden
color
at
first
smell
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
also
a
nice
white
head
super
smooth
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
leaves
a
small
trace
of
hops
between
each
sip
lacing
is
minimal
but
who
cares
when
the
beer
is
so
tasty
a
great
selection
awsome
beer
i
used
to
drink
this
when
it
was
called
yellow
snow
ale
and
i
seriously
had
no
idea
that
it
had
juniper
berries
in
it
because
i
couldnt
taste
anything
fruity
and
thats
still
the
case
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
practically
no
head
aroma
is
balanced
with
some
citrusy
hop
flavors
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
showing
through
taste
is
really
balanced
too
which
makes
this
a
good
beer
to
introduce
nonbas
into
craft
beer
the
hops
i
would
say
are
a
little
more
powerful
than
the
malt
with
a
lemony
taste
still
on
my
tongue
10
minutes
after
finishing
but
not
over
powering
hop
flavor
like
hazed
and
infused
an
above
average
pale
ale
drinkability
perfectly
fine
pale
ale
almost
towards
an
ipa
nice
and
fruity
and
refreshing
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
think
this
beer
should
be
simplified
a
bit
and
hit
a
little
heavier
with
the
juniper
to
really
allow
this
unique
ingredient
to
shine
i
think
that
the
flavor
combinations
work
against
each
other
and
down
play
the
key
player
in
this
one
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
with
a
thing
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
aroma
is
spruce
and
grapefruit
hops
over
a
big
bready
maltiness
taste
is
a
strong
pale
malt
flavor
followed
by
the
piney
hops
and
clean
berry
aftertaste
which
im
assuming
is
the
juniper
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
just
a
slight
hop
oiliness
this
is
has
a
good
mouthfeel
not
really
familiar
with
juniper
i
was
apprehensive
about
this
but
its
really
just
a
solid
apa
with
a
slight
berry
tastevery
nice
deep
yellow
in
colour
with
minimal
carbonation
mellow
malty
aroma
good
creamy
body
not
a
whole
lot
of
juniper
or
gin
flavor
just
some
nice
munich
malt
and
a
sweet
honey
like
taste
a
good
sweet
v
bitter
balance
too
not
really
what
i
had
expected
juniper
wise
but
still
very
enjoyable
this
beer
is
bangin
its
a
fine
lookin
brew
hazy
sunset
with
a
big
frothy
head
smells
spicy
citrus
up
in
hurr
a
touch
herbal
a
pinch
piney
im
hyped
taste
good
very
good
big
and
malty
yes
its
hopped
but
not
intensly
so
like
some
rogues
a
bit
grainy
with
an
awesome
spicy
hit
different
than
your
ordinary
pale
medium
in
the
mouth
yet
fullfilling
in
all
areas
an
outstanding
beer
beautiful
and
tastey
my
new
favourite
pale
ale
damn
nice
beer
no
surprise
from
roque
the
beer
after
its
release
from
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
translucent
golden
amber
color
with
a
monsterous
creamy
light
tan
head
that
lingers
long
leaving
a
thick
and
sticky
sheet
of
lace
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
spicy
grass
like
with
a
slight
hint
of
juniper
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
sweet
with
a
moderate
grain
profile
and
the
top
thin
to
medium
in
feel
finish
has
a
brisk
acidity
with
the
hops
spicy
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
quite
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
the
body
is
crisply
medium
with
small
dancing
bubbles
resulting
in
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
very
hoppy
and
bitter
with
grapefruit
peels
and
juniper
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
but
just
a
notch
below
what
i
am
accustomed
to
from
these
guys
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentytwo
ounce
brown
glass
bomber
with
a
pop
off
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
i
saw
this
one
in
nashville
and
id
never
seen
it
so
i
picked
it
up
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
wont
hit
this
one
again
i
dont
know
if
its
the
juniper
or
what
but
its
not
my
favorite
orangeamber
color
and
has
a
big
white
head
head
retention
is
good
smells
big
and
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
i
do
not
really
detect
and
berries
of
any
kind
taste
balanced
has
a
big
maltiness
followed
buy
a
oily
hoppy
aftertaste
great
drinkability
a
really
well
crafted
brew
buy
it
too
bad
its
not
called
yellow
snow
anymore
pours
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
which
settles
pretty
quickly
the
color
is
a
murky
deep
yelloworange
haze
the
nose
is
nice
a
touch
of
honey
malt
but
the
spices
juniper
very
faint
i
think
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
spiced
ale
it
could
be
alot
more
forward
in
that
aspect
of
the
profile
right
away
the
taste
reminds
me
of
caramel
and
citrus
fruits
followed
by
raw
honey
into
a
medium
bitter
finish
the
balance
honeyish
and
citrusy
without
being
overly
sweet
goes
to
its
credit
in
my
book
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
full
seems
almost
heavy
coating
the
mouth
yet
it
feels
alot
like
soft
spring
water
too
smooth
soft
somewhat
sweet
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
pale
ale
and
the
price
is
also
very
reasonable
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
gold
almost
amber
color
not
much
head
but
good
lace
the
first
whiff
i
got
upon
opening
the
bottle
was
a
nice
hop
floralness
once
in
the
glass
i
also
got
the
rich
malt
aromas
and
some
slight
citrus
flavor
is
what
i
consider
a
standard
craft
pale
ale
slightly
carmelized
malt
followed
by
a
slightly
spicy
hop
flavor
nothing
special
but
not
macroized
if
thats
a
word
either
a
bit
watery
but
that
makes
it
more
drinkable
to
me
as
i
am
not
a
huge
hop
head
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
i
appreciate
the
concept
inherent
in
this
herbal
beer
however
this
ale
is
less
charismatic
than
most
of
rogues
other
efforts
juniper
pale
ale
also
known
as
yellow
snow
is
clouded
chamomile
color
with
a
relaxed
sudsy
head
and
broad
draping
lace
it
tastes
like
a
clean
and
handsome
pale
ale
in
a
curious
juniper
dress
an
agreeable
curiosity
and
a
welcome
diversion
but
not
a
standout
on
rogues
roster
this
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
a
very
good
mix
of
bitter
and
floral
hops
and
faint
juniper
spiciness
the
taste
was
first
and
foremost
a
pale
ale
pale
malt
with
a
nice
mild
hop
bitterness
and
some
fruity
hops
and
floral
hops
the
juniper
was
barely
noticeable
but
was
there
if
you
concentrated
there
was
the
faintest
taste
of
alcohol
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
low
to
moderate
carbonation
feel
this
ale
was
relatively
clean
overall
this
was
a
rather
nice
pale
ale
with
a
little
something
extra
yellow
snow
ale
is
an
odd
name
for
a
beer
however
but
i
see
from
rogues
web
site
that
they
changed
the
name
to
juniper
pale
ale
in
jan
2005
this
beer
pours
a
yellowish
orange
color
decent
head
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
smell
is
wonderful
a
heavy
dose
of
bread
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
even
better
a
nice
malty
start
followed
by
a
generous
amount
of
spicy
hops
in
the
end
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
bread
left
behind
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
combination
of
a
nicely
weighted
pale
and
is
nicely
carbonated
and
lively
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
with
the
spicy
hops
and
the
bready
finish
nice
job
brewing
this
one
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangegolden
color
and
a
very
small
whispy
white
head
hoppy
yeasty
aroma
holds
notes
of
fruit
and
bread
with
a
vague
spiciness
in
the
background
palate
begins
with
fruity
hops
accented
by
the
juniper
berries
up
front
and
becomes
a
tad
bitter
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
significant
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
nice
and
warming
finish
very
nice
substantial
body
makes
this
a
winner
would
rate
higher
for
drinkability
if
not
for
the
kick
probably
should
limit
myself
to
one
of
these
in
a
session
pours
a
hazy
amber
golden
color
i
can
see
that
theres
good
carbonation
in
this
beer
smell
is
citrusy
and
fruity
but
also
bready
i
didnt
know
what
style
this
beer
was
but
i
could
tell
there
was
some
kind
of
spice
put
in
later
i
see
its
juniper
berries
taste
has
a
straightforward
caramel
malt
flavor
and
its
assertive
the
middle
brings
a
citrusy
flavor
along
with
some
yeast
notes
earthyness
comes
in
then
a
crisp
bitter
attack
hits
the
palate
this
is
noticeably
a
rogue
offering
and
a
good
one
at
that
well
balanced
yet
each
flavor
shows
itself
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
but
not
too
much
going
on
which
makes
me
want
more
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
a
nice
beer
to
have
i
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
locos
deli
and
pub
where
i
work
as
a
delivery
driver
it
was
poured
with
no
head
but
i
assume
it
has
decent
head
as
do
other
rogue
beers
smell
is
of
usual
pacman
yeast
and
malt
theres
a
huge
caramally
maltyness
up
front
in
the
taste
spicy
herbal
hop
finish
overall
flavor
leans
eversoslightly
in
favor
of
the
malt
character
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
tap
wish
there
were
more
rogue
bottles
to
be
had
in
alabama
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
is
nice
and
light
smooth
across
the
tongue
and
well
carbonated
to
carry
its
carefree
stature
it
strikes
me
as
odd
that
this
is
released
as
a
winter
seasonal
but
then
again
something
this
nice
and
drinkable
might
be
the
perfect
choice
to
liven
a
cold
gray
day
excellent
dn
this
would
make
a
great
ipa
as
an
apa
this
beer
rocks
hard
well
done
and
i
was
sad
to
see
the
keg
die
mouthfeel
has
a
creamy
aspect
throughout
along
with
good
carbonation
and
body
its
a
shame
this
is
only
a
winter
seasonal
because
i
could
drink
this
stuff
year
round
a
couple
bottles
would
make
a
nice
session
check
this
one
out
if
youre
a
pale
ale
fan
tastes
very
good
hops
malt
and
juniper
berries
predomiant
good
head
and
nice
lacing
as
well
alcohol
is
well
cloaked
nice
bitter
aftertaste
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
rogues
brews
nice
bright
yellow
colour
with
very
nice
off
white
head
and
great
lacing
very
strong
hoppy
aroma
and
a
nice
fruity
taste
with
a
pear
aftertaste
a
quite
hoppy
ale
more
than
i
am
used
to
but
quite
balanced
would
like
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
to
see
where
they
fit
in
good
mouthfeel
kinda
spicy
and
pretty
drinkable
a
nice
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
tightlypacked
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
some
lace
smell
was
a
piney
malt
with
a
lot
of
hops
more
than
most
rogue
ales
taste
was
a
very
refreshing
hops
up
front
with
the
pineyness
of
juniper
berries
very
long
finish
with
some
maltiness
finally
arriving
very
crisp
yet
fullbodied
i
love
this
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
i
had
better
stock
up
pours
an
amber
colour
creamy
head
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
persisted
floral
aroma
hoppy
berries
hopped
up
fruity
and
dry
sweet
fruit
balanced
by
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
i
always
like
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
and
this
one
suited
me
just
fine
would
drink
this
more
often
but
a
bit
pricey
around
here
anchor
liberty
is
a
better
and
cheaper
alternative
i
had
this
on
tap
at
anam
cara
the
color
was
gold
to
light
brown
and
cloudy
no
head
or
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
had
a
fruity
character
both
from
the
hops
as
well
as
from
something
i
discovered
later
reading
rogues
site
was
juniper
berries
the
taste
had
more
of
the
citrus
character
along
with
a
tartness
that
had
to
come
from
the
berries
the
malt
is
blended
well
to
provide
a
balance
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
tartness
and
flavor
lent
by
the
juniper
carries
through
the
entire
beer
this
had
a
nice
light
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
once
you
get
used
to
the
addition
of
the
berries
this
beer
grows
on
you
this
is
one
great
pale
ale
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
and
an
incredibly
complex
malt
profile
excellent
stuff
nice
beer
i
still
cant
figure
out
the
sourness
but
i
enjoyed
it
dull
copper
hue
a
decent
hop
aroma
with
some
freshly
squeezed
lemon
and
oranges
that
graze
the
nose
creamy
a
quick
in
yer
face
blast
of
citrus
hops
fresh
fruit
in
the
way
of
orange
and
berries

you
try
to
taste
the
juniper
berries
massively
dry
palate
99

rounded
mouthfeel
rich
and
satisfying
very
well
done
pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
color
with
some
amber
highlights
thin
white
head
bready
malty
aromas
sharp
hops
and
a
spicy
yeasty
aroma
faint
holly
bush
aroma
likely
from
the
juniper
berries
malty
and
husky
a
light
fruitiness
and
a
yeast
character
that
comes
across
as
spicy
mixing
well
with
the
light
astringency
of
the
hops
juniper
berries
show
up
in
the
finish
adding
a
light
spruciness
and
complementing
the
hops
well
solid
apa
with
some
winterlike
qualities
in
the
sense
of
the
light
presence
of
juniper
berries
somewhat
disappointing
this
had
all
the
makings
of
an
interesting
beer
but
all
in
all
is
rather
pedestrian
saffron
colour
with
no
head
a
ring
of
lace
settles
where
the
beer
sets
for
a
little
while
despite
that
no
lace
at
all
smells
of
malt
gin
dry
hops
and
cigar
leafs
is
tobacco
brewed
in
this
beer
tastes
okay
earthy
tobacco
and
gin
taste
mellowed
out
by
a
sweet
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
astringent
this
was
my
first
beer
from
rogue
i
was
disappointed
its
actually
a
bit
of
a
bland
beer
personally
i
find
very
little
to
write
about
it
yeah
it
was
drinkable
but
this
is
one
beer
i
wont
be
purchasing
hopefully
my
next
rogue
experience
will
be
a
much
more
pleasing
one
taste
is
light
and
malty
and
cascade
hops
are
noticeably
absent
its
a
pleasant
dry
taste
which
adds
a
little
more
drinkability
but
at
the
expense
of
complexity
fine
beer
even
if
you
miss
the
hint
of
juniper
berries
like
me
because
i
really
dont
know
what
they
taste
like
brown
650
ml
bottle
with
freshness
date
printed
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
and
never
tire
of
it
it
disappeared
quicker
than
i
would
have
liked
22oz
bomber
with
the
signature
painted
label
the
pour
revealed
an
interesting
clouded
goldenorange
ale
with
a
nice
1
finger
tight
fluffy
cap
and
tiny
spiraling
bubbled
carbonation
the
nose
is
a
pleasant
fragrant
hop
bouquet
floral
grassy
fruity
with
a
sweet
undertone
im
reminded
of
anchor
liberty
here
front
side
is
a
mellow
blast
of
sweet
malts
and
fruityfloral
hops
in
almost
perfect
balance
peaches
and
pine
apricots
and
sweet
dough
wonderful
layered
tastes
medium
bodied
silky
with
some
substantial
malts
moderate
finish
where
the
creamypeachdoughy
impression
gives
way
to
a
slow
metallic
drying
with
a
fruity
very
drinkable
character
i
like
this
better
than
anchor
liberty
it
would
be
my
standard
session
ale
if
it
were
available
here
recommened
for
those
who
like
a
fruit
character
in
an
aromatic
ale
bender
factor
solid
to
style
intrepretation
it
isnt
an
ipa
keep
that
in
mind
solid
session
brew
almost
to
drinkable
however
with
saranac
readily
available
and
cheaper
this
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
cart
still
the
compexity
of
the
flavor
range
netted
it
a
4
5
pours
gold
not
really
yellow
with
spicy
and
toasty
hop
aroma
fairly
light
bodied
with
some
great
zesty
hop
flavors
spread
on
top
of
a
toasty
malt
backdrop
the
finish
is
crisp
almost
sweet
with
residual
light
spiciness
of
hops
this
is
a
good
lighter
pale
ale
but
i
fail
to
detect
the
presence
of
the
juniper
berries
listed
as
an
ingredient
on
the
bottle
this
beer
should
be
a
little
more
complex
given
all
the
ingredients
silkscreened
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
still
a
good
beer
though
light
amber
with
a
white
head
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
malt
with
hops
citrus
dominates
but
also
some
earthy
floral
also
nice
west
coast
aroma
little
subdued
though
flavor
is
malt
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
citrus
flavors
coming
thru
but
not
overpowering
nice
earthy
lightly
bitter
finish
not
as
hoppy
as
some
pale
ales
which
i
like
but
little
sweet
with
a
good
hop
flavor
would
be
a
good
cross
over
beer
i
enjoyed
it
mediumish
mouthfeel
a
nice
little
ale
very
drinkable
pleasant
pale
hoppy
creamy
like
an
icemakers
beverage
mild
some
watery
mouthfeel
cloudy
yellow
appearance
good
floral
and
spice
aroma
good
example
of
apa
popular
import
into
ontario
interesting
dry
edge
from
juniper
berries
easy
drink
another
good
balanced
brew
from
rogue
overall
this
is
a
fair
pale
ale
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
rogue
ale
it
seems
very
status
quo
for
a
rogue
beer
the
taste
was
indicative
of
apas
and
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
good
example
of
the
type
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
and
im
sure
most
apa
fans
would
find
it
highly
drinkable
ill
keep
my
stouts
and
porters
thankyouverymuch
medium
to
full
bodied
just
a
great
and
interesting
take
on
the
apa
from
a
22
oz
bomber
comes
a
cloudy
copper
or
bronze
beer
with
a
thin
white
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
a
little
too
quickly
for
me
however
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
citrusy
like
lemon
zest
and
oranges
slightly
herbal
and
piney
it
says
juniper
and
juniper
can
be
smelled
suddenly
i
am
thinking
of
christmas
for
some
reason
nice
malt
flavor
which
seems
to
be
shallow
compared
to
the
hops
and
spices
the
hops
seem
kind
of
musty
followed
by
some
slight
spicyness
and
a
hint
of
what
i
would
again
call
christmas
tree
flavor
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
it
may
be
a
bit
unbalanced
if
you
care
about
that
maybe
not
the
most
drinkable
over
a
session
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless
i
like
this
one
a
lot
one
of
the
most
drinkable
rogue
ales
that
ive
sampled
highly
recommended
its
good
stuff
but
it
could
probably
be
toned
down
a
little
bit
its
not
too
far
from
being
great
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
had
been
on
my
toget
list
for
sometime
now
and
when
i
saw
it
i
just
had
to
grab
it
the
name
alone
is
fancycomically
classy
enough
and
i
have
pasted
it
up
in
the
past
til
today
and
now
i
realize
i
shouldnt
have
done
that
im
rambling
good
stuff
get
it
drink
it
and
enjoy
i
did
poured
very
cloudy
and
orangeyyellow
alot
of
head
quickly
dissapated
into
light
and
fluffy
bubbles
looks
similar
to
natural
unfiltered
apple
cider
scents
of
fruits
and
perfume
tastes
of
hops
and
pepper
juniper
berry
taste
of
gin
good
flavor
was
kind
of
worried
about
trying
this
one
as
it
listed
styrian
hops
and
i
have
noticed
that
i
just
plain
dislike
them
find
those
beers
skunky
but
did
not
notice
the
styrian
in
here
i
have
always
enjoyed
rogue
and
this
one
fits
right
in
nice
drinkability
i
love
rogue
beers
i
have
come
to
cherish
these
beers
especially
the
shakesphere
stout
and
the
mocha
porter
i
am
a
big
fan
of
of
pale
ales
too
and
i
thought
that
this
offering
would
be
an
interesting
twist
to
the
somewhat
mondane
pale
ales
i
am
so
often
presented
with
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
might
try
it
again
only
if
i
see
it
on
tap
again
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
anyhow
this
will
not
stop
me
from
loving
and
trying
as
many
rogue
beers
as
i
possibly
can
just
maybe
this
one
juniper
pale
ale
is
interesting
beer
but
isnt
one
that
ill
pick
up
again
i
give
rogue
credit
for
trying
something
different
but
this
one
doesnt
rise
to
the
level
of
some
of
their
other
better
known
offerings
i
could
drink
three
22s
without
thinking
easy
i
like
this
one
a
lot
both
the
idea
of
it
and
the
taste
i
nice
switch
up
from
a
standard
pale
ale
i
really
regret
not
trying
this
on
draft
when
having
the
chance
theres
always
next
time
though
ok
drinkable
but
an
unbalanced
brew
i
would
pick
a
stone
pale
ale
or
sam
adams
winter
lager
over
this
the
lighter
malt
profile
blends
rather
uniquely
with
the
solid
hops
character
making
it
different
and
quite
good
the
sweetness
is
milder
than
the
hops
would
lead
you
to
expect
in
anticipation
of
balance
and
the
surprise
is
worthwhile
the
basic
elements
are
cleverly
balanced
and
refresh
rewardingly
making
another
a
virtual
certainty
a
fresh
departure
from
so
many
more
complex
beers
its
proud
of
its
simplicity
as
it
should
be
and
so
ill
watch
out
where
those
huskies
go
because
ill
likely
want
to
drink
more
of
that
yellow
snow
ahh
not
bad
but
not
a
worldbeater
thank
you
to
my
youngest
brother
for
a
sample
rogue
makes
so
many
good
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
blow
my
mind
the
same
way
the
others
do
a
little
haze
in
its
golden
color
moderate
white
head
smell
of
juniper
berries
is
very
apparent
paired
with
a
nice
hops
aroma
taste
is
spicy
and
bitter
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
i
split
a
bomber
with
a
macro
drinking
buddy
of
mine
and
he
didnt
have
many
kind
words
for
it
i
thought
it
was
good
and
something
i
would
consider
getting
again
appearance
golden
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
cream
colored
head
leaves
behind
ample
lacing
fluffy
appearance
nice
aroma
touch
of
juniper
berries
brings
about
an
herbal
tea
quality
to
the
flavor
along
with
the
pale
malts
and
mild
citrus
tone
hops
are
light
here
different
from
most
rogue
products
taste
slight
sweet
spicy
golden
ale
with
an
herbal
hop
profile
not
bad
just
nothing
blowing
me
away
i
did
enjoy
mouthfeel
light
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
slightly
fluffy
texture
drinkability
strange
unique
quality
added
from
the
juniper
berries
cant
say
i
would
frequent
drinking
this
beer
but
it
was
nice
for
something
different
bottle

poured
a
yellow
brew
with
a
nice
large
head
with
standard
retention
aroma
is
really
sweet
with
nice
touché
of
hops
and
malts
coming
out
of
my
glass
taste
is
incredible
with
the
usual
sweetness
and
refreshing
taste
of
a
pale
ale
but
with
added
bonus
of
juniper
berries
i
love
the
taste
of
gin
and
i
think
i
find
here
again
but
without
the
strong
alcohol
content
another
truly
great
beer
from
rogue
and
one
underrated
beer
in
my
own
opinion
overall
good
plus
crystal
clear
orangetinted
golden
frothy
white
head
that
dissapates
to
a
minimal
collar
small
patches
of
lace
on
the
glass
earthy
herbal
aroma
almost
cookingspice
like
very
crisp
and
fully
carbonated
big
herbal
malt
flavor
quite
zesty
and
dry
finishes
sort
of
raw
with
a
crisp
tobacco
leaf
hop
snap
an
interesting
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
though
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
something
to
have
when
you
want
someting
different
it
is
surprising
that
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
is
one
of
rogues
lighter
and
more
drinkable
offerings
also
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
classified
as
an
herbedspiced
beer
since
the
only
extra
ingredient
is
juniper
berries
although
juniper
berries
could
be
considered
to
have
a
somewhat
spicy
flavor
there
is
no
actual
spice
in
the
beer
though
a
fruit
beer
perhaps
well
not
really
this
is
essentially
a
lightish
pale
ale
with
an
accented
hop
bite
and
a
bitter
tartness
from
the
juniper
berries
which
are
not
at
all
sweet
berries
theyre
used
to
make
gin
remember
a
light
clear
gold
with
average
head
and
lacing
the
malts
are
the
high
point
of
the
beer
and
are
generally
light
and
biscuity
but
there
is
a
roastier
almost
chocolatey
undercurrent
that
really
appeals
to
me
a
very
crisp
clean
appealing
taste
in
which
no
yeast
intrudes
the
end
result
being
refreshing
if
maybe
a
little
onedimensional
the
hops
close
things
out
with
a
tweak
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
dry
and
a
bit
metallic
not
particularly
good
its
that
malt
that
keeps
me
intrigued
though
this
is
definitely
whacked
out
stuff
its
so
incredibly
bitter
that
its
endearing
and
i
challenged
myself
to
another
pint
i
could
stand
for
a
bit
more
malt
but
for
some
reason
balance
doesnt
seem
like
an
issue
with
this
one
i
have
no
clue
what
juniper
tastes
like
but
its
definitely
piney
and
real
damn
bitter
in
a
floral
vegetal
way
no
one
else
seemed
to
think
this
was
especially
bitter
and
i
recall
being
a
bit
meh
about
the
bottle
when
i
had
it
a
couple
years
ago
the
tap
version
was
seriously
bitter
stuff
maybe
it
was
dryberried
if
you
like
punishment
that
transcends
anything
a
hop
can
produce
seek
this
keg
out
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
boasts
of
pale
ale
malts
and
an
array
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
is
a
light
pale
beer
with
an
awesome
hop
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
it
says
it
is
brewed
with
juniper
berries
but
i
dont
taste
them
it
is
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
very
well
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
these
guys
it
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
only
because
of
the
name
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
thanks
quaffer
for
helping
me
reel
in
my
white
whale
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
bottles
thus
far
pours
a
medium
straw
yellow
with
a
puffy
offwhite
head
smells
of
light
macroish
malt
with
palpable
unmacroish
floral
and
citrusy
hop
notes
taste
is
light
crisp
smooth
malts
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
hops
are
the
main
event
here
very
grapefruitcitrusy
in
flavor
but
not
too
bitter
finish
is
a
touch
oily
bitter
and
thirstquenching
id
rather
drink
this
in
the
summer
than
in
the
winter
reminds
me
a
little
of
new
belgiums
loft
but
i
like
the
loft
more
poured
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
sizable
white
head
that
dissipated
over
time
the
aroma
was
light
fresh
and
sweet
tasting
it
caught
me
by
surprise
as
the
light
aroma
indicated
that
it
would
be
a
delicate
mouthfeel
not
so
it
was
firm
and
almost
chunky
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
and
effervescent
while
the
flavor
was
almost
sugary
its
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
for
something
called
yellow
snow
it
really
seemed
more
appropriate
for
a
summers
day
good
but
not
great
id
buy
it
order
it
and
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
drinkabilitynotes
kind
of
your
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
just
a
good
drink
reminds
me
of
a
not
quite
as
powerful
anchor
liberty
ale
ill
have
to
revisit
it
at
some
time
i
suppose
see
what
i
think
later
on
just
above
average
i
was
kind
of
exspecting
more
nice
yellowish
amber
color
with
a
lacey
head
it
is
kinda
flat
however
subtle
hops
just
barely
there
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
except
the
name
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
the
nose
is
good
and
gives
note
of
the
hops
and
the
nice
malt
base
flavors
tend
toward
citrus
fruit
notes
though
the
lighting
spicing
sharpen
the
edge
and
give
this
brew
some
nice
tight
tartness
the
feel
is
smooth
but
has
nice
crispness
in
the
ending
eminently
drinkable
and
refreshing
pours
a
colour
of
saffron
infused
beer
i
almost
wanted
to
make
risotto
milanese
with
this
at
first
glance
smelled
of
hops
with
a
definate
piney
hoppy
smell
taste
was
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
gin
like
spice
from
the
juniper
berries
fortunately
the
jumiper
didnt
overwhelm
as
i
find
gin
disgusting
it
was
more
of
the
subtle
juniper
used
in
german
or
czech
recipes
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
sticky
due
to
the
hops
but
good
none
the
less
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
another
great
offering
from
rogue
i
wish
it
were
around
more
of
the
year
a
very
odd
ale
but
enjoyable
ill
have
to
try
this
again
but
probably
not
for
a
while
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
head
lasted
through
most
of
the
drink
and
glass
lacing
was
produced
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
honey
tones
the
malt
flavor
is
quite
smooth
and
some
bitterness
and
spiciness
arrived
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
i
noticed
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
sticks
to
the
back
of
your
tongue
well
after
swallowing
enjoyable
and
drinkable
even
though
the
name
of
this
one
gets
you
thinking
this
one
poured
with
a
medium
frothy
head
and
left
frothy
lacing
it
was
yellow
with
a
tinge
of
orange
it
tasted
mildly
hoppy
with
some
subtle
spicyness
perhaps
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
lacked
excitement
a
decent
beer
but
is
missing
the
oomph
and
vibrancy
i
enjoy
a
light
yellow
pour
with
a
good
size
head
it
had
a
semi
floral
smell
nothing
spectacular
i
didnt
care
much
for
the
taste
i
was
upset
with
the
lack
of
balance
that
rogue
usually
exceeds
in
i
like
hoppy
but
this
was
too
much
pours
foggy
yellow
orange
with
quite
a
bit
of
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
citrucy
aroma
that
fades
fairly
quickly
taste
uhhmm
its
bitter
a
bit
grainy
and
bready
in
the
end
before
more
bitterness
puts
a
stop
to
all
that
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
but
not
too
bad
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
e
decent
white
head
resembling
your
average
american
lager
in
appearance
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grainy
side
with
a
good
dose
floral
hops
backing
things
up
taste
is
nothing
special
here
mostly
bitter
from
start
to
finish
there
is
some
grainyness
in
the
background
not
really
malty
just
a
slight
taste
of
cereal
grains
this
beer
could
use
some
balance
mostly
floral
bitter
hops
not
much
else
besides
a
funky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
fairly
clean
but
nothing
special
too
bitter
without
enough
flavor
to
be
very
drinkable
nothing
special
here
your
average
rogue
ale
only
not
as
good
dont
drink
the
yellow
snow
either
now
off
to
see
if
that
whole
violets
thing
is
true
slightly
thinner
bodied
than
i
had
hoped
however
this
would
make
a
good
leftfield
session
beer
just
because
its
a
unique
concoction
a
most
drinkable
beer
at
any
time
of
the
year
drinking
this
beautifully
balanced
beer
is
an
intense
experience
i
can
see
the
hops
on
the
trellis
i
can
taste
the
grain
at
the
end
i
enjoy
the
pretty
cascade
of
lacing
and
look
forward
to
picking
up
some
more
of
these
well
i
was
told
not
to
eat
yellow
snow
but
noone
said
anything
about
not
drinking
it
poured
a
bright
orange
color
with
a
decent
white
head
atop
looks
sticky
and
has
retained
at
a
film
aroma
is
very
floral
full
of
hops
much
like
an
ipa
the
taste
is
as
delicious
as
expected
begins
with
a
bitter
hop
taste
hints
of
roastyness
and
a
sweet
n
spicy
finish
dry
like
the
bottle
says
it
is
as
we
come
into
winter
this
was
a
great
beer
to
break
up
the
monotony
and
also
a
nice
break
from
many
of
the
dark
and
heavy
seasonals
highly
recommended
an
orange
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
the
smell
nicely
hoppy
and
had
a
mellow
fruit
sweetness
berries
and
maybe
some
apricot
as
well
the
taste
had
a
decent
combintaion
of
hops
and
fruitiness
giving
it
nice
balance
fruitiness
is
present
up
front
and
then
becomes
more
dry
malty
towards
the
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
semidry
finish
decent
drinkability
not
one
of
my
faves
drinkability
a
good
easydrinking
offering
from
rogue
juniper
berries
offer
an
interesting
twist
try
this
one
if
you
can
ng
appearance
is
a
typical
yellowamber
color
head
dissipation
is
also
typical
hops
are
immediately
present
in
the
aroma
although
i
didnt
pick
up
on
the
junipers
and
spice
all
that
much
thats
good
that
they
werent
overwhelming
light
and
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
and
i
would
consider
it
highly
drinkable
i
actually
think
this
beer
could
pass
as
a
lager
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
as
well
but
on
tap
is
the
way
to
go
even
though
it
is
not
as
big
as
many
other
rogue
brews
yellow
snow
is
still
quite
good
this
is
a
beer
to
give
someone
you
are
trying
to
bring
into
the
rogue
nation
seems
to
pour
more
of
an
orange
color
than
a
urine
color
but
what
the
hellwith
a
decenthead
that
left
a
light
lacing
on
my
pint
glassdefinent
northwestern
ale
smell
of
zesty
hops
taste
does
have
a
nice
malt
firmness
to
it
with
a
slight
juniper
taste
finishing
with
a
hop
atttack
wich
kinda
brings
this
beer
together
apretty
good
beer
but
rogue
makes
better
good
effort
even
so
the
juniper
backing
gives
this
particular
beer
a
bit
of
a
subtle
spicy
edge
which
other
beers
might
do
well
to
emulate
a
great
example
of
how
one
or
two
unusual
ingredients
can
add
considerably
to
a
beer
not
one
of
rogues
best
yet
still
a
relatively
good
brew
pours
a
light
amberorange
colour
that
is
slighly
hazy
but
has
a
nice
frothychunky
head
to
it
i
was
quite
surprised
to
see
this
from
this
type
of
beer
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
a
bit
citrusy
with
a
sweet
berryness
dominating
the
taste
echoes
the
smell
the
the
hops
are
more
balanced
with
the
sweetness
than
in
the
smell
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
id
certainly
try
again
but
would
rather
just
about
any
other
rogue
beverage
that
ive
tried
thusfar
over
this
one

what
nice
inviting
smell
of
fresh
hop
leaves
cascades
not
sure
what
a
juniper
even
smells
or
tastes
like
but
this
had
a
fresh
crisp
snap
to
the
flavor
slight
fizzyness
dulls
the
flavors
but
the
citrus
snap
comes
back
lots
of
hops
and
earthy
spiciness
to
it
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
really
cleanses
the
palate
and
leaves
you
dry
and
puckering
waiting
for
more
another
quality
product
from
rogue
i
had
this
right
at
the
beginning
of
my
beer
advocating
life
and
was
intimidated
by
it
its
really
very
good
and
well
worth
trying

gotta
love
that

medium

a

maybe
the
least
favorite
ive
had
from

nothing

had

bottle
according
to
the
bottle
this
came
from
the
2002
batch
so
it
may
have
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
too
long
explaining
the
bit
of
funkiness
ill
certainly
give
it
another
chance
overall
impression
regardless
of
advice
you
have
received
in
the
past
dont
pass
up
this
yellow
snow
the
juniper
berries
on
the
label
concerned
me
i
cant
stand
gin
but
i
didnt
note
any
ginlike
tastes
here
like
all
rogue
products
this
is
very
well
made
and
a
tongue
pleaser
drinkability
hmm
thinking
this
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
taste
is
very
drinkable
but
the
aftertaste
and
the
firm
alcohol
level
guessing
around
6
will
probably
slow
you
down
if
youre
a
hophead
scoop
up
some
yellow
snow
22
oz
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
an
oily
quality
to
it
that
is
a
little
unpleaseant
it
drinks
well
with
a
dry
finish
finish
lasts
a
bit
too
long
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
it
has
some
flaws
but
the
good
points
more
than
make
up
for
them
while
poured
from
tap
the
color
of
it
was
a
dark
golden
with
medium
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
this
ale
had
a
floralherbal
and
spicy
aroma
that
really
wasnt
that
good
the
taste
was
of
a
hoppy
spicyherbal
floral
flavor
that
just
didnt
move
me
it
did
nothing
for
me
because
the
spicyherbal
flavor
of
this
ale
just
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
to
taste
this
2002
brew
poured
a
small
head
of
small
bubbles
it
had
a
transparent
light
amber
colored
body
with
carbonation
rising
in
the
mug
it
has
a
floral
aroma
and
a
very
tart
initial
taste
that
was
overcome
by
and
even
stronger
bittertart
finish
that
left
behind
some
spicy
elements
22
oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
slowly
receded
leaving
some
fine

on
the
glass

is
hops
and
some
malt
taste
is
hoppy
with
some
malt
sweetness
good
carbonation
and
a
fairly
strong
mouthfeel
from
the
hops
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
spicy
citrus
aroma
with
a
good
hops
nose
also
just
a
little
too
faint
the
taste
is
spicy
at
first
you
really
notice
the
saffron
in
there
the
strong
hops
help
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
and
the
smoothness
gives
it
a
nice
drinkability
nice
to
enjoy
while
just
relaxing
22

bomber
pours
a
clouded
honey
golden
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
consists
of
spicy
hops
malt
and
hint
of
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
creamy
and
smooth
taste
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
hops
are
spicy
yet
not
overwhelming
use
of
juniper
berries
adds
a
uniquely
subtle
pine
flavor
to
the
beer
great
tasting
allaround
some
of
the
flavor
aspects
mainly
the
hops
but
on
a
lesser
intesity
of
yellow
snow
sort
of
reminded
me
of
rogues
santas
private
reserve
definitely
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
dryness
and
bitterness
are
a
little
much
and
restrain
me
from
giving
this
amazing
beer
a
higher
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
dispite
the
amazing
flavor
poured
with

tiny
bubbles
pretty
orangegold
color
white
head
and
nice
lace
signature
rogue
hoppiness
but
this
one
has
some
floral
spicy
kick
to
it
as
well
the
hops
are
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
very
drinkable

i
could
knock
back
many
of
these
clear
golden
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
when
sipped
down
definitely
not
the
color
of
yellow
snow
the
aroma
is
fruity
grainy
and
bready
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
spice
it
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
beer
smooth
and
tasty
not
a
bad
brew
bottled
in
2002
this
brew
poured
a
very
small
head
it
had
good
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
mug
it
poured
a
good
amber
color
in
my
opinion
it
had
a
fruity
and
citrusy
aroma
it
was
bitter
tasting
and
it
left
a
lingering
aftertaste
not
a
brew
high
on
my
list
this
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
head
that
left
trace
lace
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
spices
the
finish
has
a
tangy
aspect
to
it
also
some
elements
of
wood
that
lend
just
a
touch
of
astrigency
to
it
this
beer
first
poured
into
the
glass
a
clear
well
carbonated
golden
straw
color
but
with
each
pour
it
became
progressively
cloudy
the
head
was
white
in
color
with
a
fairly
decent
head
semidense
and
creamy
it
left
no
lace
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
malt
a
slight
burnt
sugar
faint
milk
chocolate
spicy
and
floral
hops
juniper
berries
caramel
and
earth
tones
the
tastes
that
rolled
across
the
tongue
and
to
the
back
of
the
throat
were
of
sweet
malts
juniper
berries
floral
hops
which
seemed
dominate
yeast
pine
trees
and
some
herb
tones
through
out
some
hoppy
aftertastes
were
present
medium
body
made
this
beer
pleasant
and
not
overbearing
the
flavors
seemed
to
become
more
pronounced
as
it
warmed
i
wasnt
sure
if
this
beer
would
be
my
cup
of
tea
but
after
tasting
it
i
discovered
that
it
is
i
rather
liked
it
another
good
beer
from
rogue
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
balanced
and
had
a
cleaner
drier
finish
to
it
though
a
very
wellbalanced
and
intriguing
beer
clean
crisp
and
highly
quaffable
well
worth
a
try
though
some
may
not
understand
its
restrained
complexities
the
flavor
is
very
welcoming
and
interesting
it
is
sweet
with
nice
malts
and
fruits
at
the
start
as
is
slides
down
it
starts
to
get
bitter
and
spicy
from
the
hops
i
guess
that
the
juniper
berries
have
something
to
do
with
that
also
but
i
am
really
not
familiar
with
juniper
berries
so
i
cant
really
say
for
sure
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
imagine
it
to
be
a
great
warm
weather
drinker
but
i
am
enjoying
it
just
as
much
after
walking
through
knee
deep
snow
maybe
i
will
go
make
some
yellow
to
honor
this
fine
brew
from
rogue
pours
a
brilliant
burnt
orange
color
that
is
hazed
a
bit
and
produced
a
modest
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
light
layer
covering
the
beer
like
a
blanket
it
has
a
very
very
faint
aroma
with
nearly
no
discernable
aromas
this
is
a
very
unique
characteristic
or
lack
there
of
from
an
awesome
brewery
the
taste
reveals
lightly
sweet
malt
with
a
wellpronounced
hop
it
is
light
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
dry
bitter
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
but
it
could
be
a
great
crossover
beer
to
get
a
macro
drinker
familiar
with
hops
without
shocking
their
taste
buds
cheers
the
smell
is
an
amalgam
of
candylike
caramel
malt
herbal
hops
and
some
pungent
pine
which
is
distinctive
and
quite
different
from
the
piney
character
of
pnw
hops
the
taste
is
of
spicy
and
herbal
hops
which
are
accentuated
by
the
green
piney
flavor
of
juniper
some
light
crystal
malt
comes
up
in
mid
palate
peeks
in
the
window
sees
all
the
hops
and
juniper
having
a
party
and
decides
its
in
the
wrong
neighborhood
the
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
a
bit
creamy
the
finish
is
sharply
bitter
which
i
personally
enjoy
but
i
could
see
where
this
would
turn
off
others
a
tasty
brew
imo
but
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
my
first
sample
from
rogue
i
expected
more
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
herbspice
beers
ill
try
a
stout
or
pale
ale
and
see
how
that
goes
this
seems
to
be
a
loveitorhateit
beer
i
place
myself
squarely
in
the
former
category
crystal
clear
and
golden
in
color
this
beer
sports
the
typical
huge
rogue
pillowy
head
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
down
the
side
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
and
a
bit
spicy
flavor
starts
off
with
a
smooth
malty
body
which
soon
develops
a
pleasant
fruitiness
from
the
juniper
berries
slightly
acidic
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
but
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
kicks
in
to
make
this
an
incredibly
wellbalanced
beer
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
but
with
just
enough
complexity
to
make
this
a
great
session
beer
for
genuine
beer
lovers
pours
a
cloudy
deep
orange
gold
the
white
head
dissapeared
almost
as
quickly
as
i
poured
it
aroma
is
musty
and
and
slightly
fruity
with
very
reserved
scents
of
biscuity
malt
and
herbal
hops
flavor
is
quite
bold
especially
considering
how
subdued
the
aroma
is
beginning
with
slightly
sweet
toasted
malt
then
becoming
quite
spicy
and
a
little
bit
fruity
finishing
quite
bitter
with
some
notes
of
gin
obviously
the
juniper
berries
at
work
has
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
rough
mouthfeel
a
very
interesting
brew
that
is
pretty
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
22oz
bottle
labeled
2002
slightly
hazed
brownish
gold
in
color
with
a
small
amount
of
white
head
aroma
comprised
mainly
of
citrusy
hops
but
malt
is
also
detected
yellow
snow
has
a
good
tasting
smooth
malt
backbone
well
hopped
but
not
nearly
as
aggresively
as
i
had
anticipated
citrusy
floral
hop
flavor
barely
edges
out
the
malt
taste
almost
seems
to
bounce
back
and
forth
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
this
balance
of
flavor
keeps
it
interesting
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
as
bold
as
many
other
rogue
offerings
it
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
was
fruit
and
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
doughy
smell
the
flavor
packed
some
spice
but
nothing
overwhelming
like
some
other
spiced
varieties
the
hops
provided
the
most
flavor
in
my
book
making
this
beer
seem
pretty
traditional
to
me
a
solid
brew
pours
a
hazy
bright
orange
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
is
floral
hops
spices
and
is
a
bit
herbal
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
is
a
bit
slick
in
the
mouth
with
notes
of
fruit
juniper
berries
and
sweet
bready
malts
with
a
strong
oily
and
bitter
hop
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
though
the
bitter
hops
seem
to
overpower
the
other
flavors

not

still
a

i
will
have
to
find
a

more

a

another

not

not

but
it
is
drinkable
a
very
fine
brew
from
rogue
a
brewery
that
for
one
reason
or
another
i
have
tried
very
little
while
the
name
may
turn
some
off
this
brew
pours
a
wonderful
golden
color
that
still
offers
more
character
than
your
regular
old
golden
beer
the
head
is
respectable
and
apparent
for
a
short
time
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
brews
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
the
taste
is
extremely
palatable
and
would
go
well
with
just
about
any
fare
in

it

find

try
it

and
buttery
malt
very
inviting
the
flavor
starts
with
a
very
nice
gently
sweet
malt
thats
laced
with
toasty
biscuit
and
caramel
a
creamy
mouthfeel
enhances
the
maltiness
the
body
is
deceptive
seemingly
fuller
than
it
actually
is
and
the
gentle
carbonation
is
very
fine
hops
emerge
with
both
bitterness
and
flavor
earthy
lightly
citrusy
fruity
or
is
that
the
juniper
just
prior
to
the
swallow
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
maltiness
and
some
minor
hops
notes
although
i
cannot
distinguish
the
juniper
berries
there
is
something
very
distinct
about
this
beer
and
i
can
only
assume
that
they
are
the
cause
quite
a
unique
and
charming
beer
that
offers
some
good
malt
character
although
not
alot
of
complexity
but
also
retains
the
rogue
signature
hoppiness
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
winter
beers
pours
golden
very
nice
aroma
smells
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
reveals
a
nice
maltiness
with
strong

bitterness
the
beer
seems
to
change
flavors
as
i
drink
the
glass
at
the
top
was
mostly
bitterness
by
the
bottom
third
of
the
glass
im
getting
more
citrus
taste
i
like
the
very
specific
ingredients
list
on
the
bottle
detailing
the
type
of
hops
malts
and
yeast
used
listed
on
the
bottle
as
a
pale
ale
there
is
a
pleasant
lingering

to

that
offsets
the

but
leaves
the
dextrinous

intact
a

once
the

fades
finishes
slightly

otherwise
clean

is
quite
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
although
the
strong

bitterness
considering
the
low
gravity
does
throw
the
balance
askew
what
else
does
one
expect
from
rogue
all
around
its
a
hoppy
aromatic
and
unique
session
beer
dont
eat
the
yellow
snow
but
by
all
means
drink
it
this
ale
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
hue
from
the
tap
and
features
a
durable
bubbly
head
the
nose
typical
of
most
rogue
products
is
quite
hoppy
leaving
not
much
else
to
the
imagination
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
and
balanced
featuring
a
nice
amount
of
bittering
hops
malt
and
some
fruit
juniper
berries
the
carbonation
is
just
right
on
this
one

yellow

scores
high
a
quality
offering
and
well
worth
seeking
out
on

many
bubbles
ascend
rapidly
to
form
a
frothy

with
great
staying
power
pale

in
color
definitely
pale
ale
sweet
floral
hop
aromas
abound
in
the
nose
hints
of
toasted
malt
and
what
im
guessing
is
the
product
of
juniper
berries
from
the
bottles
statement
but
ive
never
had
juniper
berries
so
i
wouldnt
know
flavors
appear
that
jump
between
malty
and
hoppy
as
it
rolls
over
your
palate
and
combine
in
a
wellbalanced
sweetness
medium
body
hints
of
what
i
again
assume
is
the
juniper
abound
later
on
a
small
amount
of
rindlike
flavor
appears
and
leaves
a
bit
of
bitterness
behind
on
the
edges
of
your
tongue
although
i
expected
more
of
a
spicy
brew
this
is
a
great
wellbalanced
beer
that
i
find
very
satisfying
rogue
beers
never
fail
to
impress
me
this
one
never
failed
to
impress
me
either
nevermind
the
juniper
berrries
this
is
just
good
pacific
northwest
ale
excellent
head
very
tasty
clean
bitterness
i
like
it
pours
out
of
the
22
oz
bomber
a
cloudy
hazy
orange
colour
northwest
hop
aroma
with
some
pale
malt
notes
too
really
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
sessionable
taste
nothing
really
stands
out
over
the
other
balanced
pale
ale
characteristics
definite
rogue
hops
with
an
earthy
dry
finish
that
im
assuming
is
due
to
the
use
of
juniper
a
nice
pale
ale
with
a
twist
the
ultimate
rogue
session
ale
tasty
first
taste
of
amarillo
hops
that
im
aware
of
and
i
like
em
creamy
full
mouthfeel
floral
nose
with
a
definite
malt
presence
a
draught
takes
you
through
a
wide
range
of
flavor
but
this
beers
unique
characteristic
is
the
bitter
juniper
finish
that
sits
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
for
hours
i
wanted
to
drink
it
out
of
a
martini
glass
with
a
fat
garlic
stuffed
olive
rolling
about
quite
tasty
winter
brew
with
a
clean
taste
and
smooth
finish
dad
always
told
me
not
to
eat
the
yellow
snow
he
never
had
this
stuff
orangegold
and
hazy
body
initially
poured
to
a
big
bubbly
white
head
head
fades
quickly
but
the
carbonation
keeps
a
rich
lace
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
here
thick
and
bubbly
there
the
aroma
is
rich
and
earthy
reminds
me
of
being
in
the
woods
at
my
uncles
place
surrounded
by
evergreens
a
hint
of
fruit
is
also
present
in
the
nose
herb
flavors
are
strong
but
not
overpowering
theyre
most
notable
on
the
finish
where
they
blend
incredibly
well
with
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
one
helluva
beer
it
recently
became
available
in
indy
along
with
quite
a
few
other
rogue
brews
and
i
hope
its
here
to
stay
big
head
clearish
orangeamber
fresh
and
deep
malt
aroma
touch
of
evergreen
malty
flavor
but
a
nice
light
body
without
a
lot
of
syrupy
qualities
very
nice
subtle
bittering
aided
by
the
slight
pine
taste
nonassertive
but
gradual
again
rogue
shows
an
uncanny
ability
to
balance
its
brews
flavor
profiles
malts
are
wonderfully
combined
this
ale
is
inherently
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
on
tap
all
night
on
a
cool
evening
after
the
pour
tasting
i
took
a
pull
right
out
of
the
bottle
this
method
concentrates
the
juniper
flavors
more
pours
a
beautiful
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
a
clinging
lace
citrus
aromas
from
th
hops
blend
well
with
the
piney
smell
from
the
juniper
berries
slick
hoppy
flavors
with
a
nice
gin
like
flavor
from
the
juniper
berries
again
a
very
slick
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
to
it
that
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
yet
another
great
offereing
from
rogue
a
pale
ale
with
a
twist
that
definitely
wouldnt
be
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
beer
and
you
like
gin
then
you
will
probably
like
this
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
very
unusual
for
the
type
of
beer
it
was
the
addition
of
the
slight
juniperevergreen
taste
to
the
lighter
beer
was
not
unpleasant
id
have
to
drink
it
again
to
say
if
i
really
liked
it
or
if
it
was
just
another
beer
that
was
a
little
better
than
the
rest
though
rerate
12702
adjusted
the
ratings
a
little
nose
is
unremarkable
kind
of
a
grassy
hop
texture
to
it
the
juniper
is
very
hidden
in
the
taste
and
nose
this
time
it
wasnt
charged
up
at
all
im
not
real
high
on
this
beer
its
ok
but
not
as
good
as
i
expect
a
rogue
winter
seasonal
to
be
the
appearance
is
what
youd
expect
from
the
source
of
yellow
snow
a
pale
straw
color
a
very
nice
unassuming
hop
boquet
on
the
nose
this
beer
tastes
great
the
one
word
that
comes
to
mind
is
delicious
i
think
the
blend
of
hops
and
juniper
berries
give
this
beer
a
very
unique
and
wonderful
taste
i
was
surprised
to
finally
find
this
beer
in
mn
im
glad
its
here
and
will
be
getting
more
big
and
malty
like
all
the
other
rogue
beers
but
theres
something
lacking
hops
are
a
bit
off
too
pungent
with
a
strong
rawoily
aftertaste
what
impressed
me
about
this
ale
was
how
sharp
the
spicyfloral
hops
were
at
the
middle
but
then
became
quite
dry
at
the
finish
with
relatively
little
hops
residual
notes
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
though
hops
seem
to
over
take
the
brew
with
an
earthened
hop
flavour
that
may
not
be
agreeable
with
some
beer
drinkers
pours
with
a
small
white
head
has
a
reddish
brown
color
has
aromas
of
malts
gingerbread
and
hops
initial
taste
is
of
gingerbread
hops
and
malts
the
combination
of
these
flavors
persists
throughout
the
aftertaste
not
a
very
complex
melody
of
flavors
the
gingerbread
flavor
is
somewhat
weak
compared
to
the
hops
and
malts
hops
give
the
flavor
and
added
sweetness
on
top
of
the
gingerbread
while
the
amber
malts
give
it
a
crisp
taste
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
too
impressive
not
very
tasty
so
wont
be
repeating
that
purchase
c
personally
i
really
enjoyed
this
if
youre
into
seasonal
brews
such
as
pumpkin
ales
this
is
for
you
appearance
nice
dark
amber
two
fingers
of
off
white
foam
that
quickly
goes
down
to
a
thin
layer
smells
like
sweet
gingerbread
tastes
like
gingerbread
nutmeg
and
hints
of
pumpkin
spice
finishes
clean
with
a
nice
gingerbread
aftertaste
very
light
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
over
sweet
and
watery
looks
and
smells
decent
awful
when
you
take
a
sip
way
too
much
ginger
for
not
enough
body
dont
usually
like
flavored
beers
but
this
was
interesting
nice
beer
to
relax
with
when
you
just
want
to
drink
beer
o
for
what
they
were
trying
for
they
pretty
much
succeeded
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
gingerbread
cookies
dip
your
plain
gingerbread
cookie
in
some
brown
ale
and
this
is
what
you
get
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
brown
with
ok
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
of
molasses
and
gingerbread
cookies
taste
is
similar
with
touches
of
molasses
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
sweet
maltiness
carbonation
is
just
the
right
amount
from
keeping
this
beer
from
being
flat
nice
balance
and
i
swear
this
tastes
just
like
gingerbread
cookies
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
but
overall
balances
well
and
is
enjoyable
especially
around
the
holidays
on
a
cold
day
nothing
spectacular
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
had
good
carbonation
and
and
a
subtle
nutmeg
nose
to
it
mouthfeel
was
oily
and
uncomfortable
a
whole
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
given
my
recentish
exposure
to
this
brewerys
wares
it
does
indeed
come
across
as
very
gingerbreadlike
but
still
in
a
beer
format
not
that
id
want
a
number
of
servings
of
this
but
hey
that
goes
the
same
for
the
holiday
confection
that
its
aping
as
well
overly
sweet
and
too
thin
ba
is
telling
me
i
need
to
enter
a
review
to
submit
not
sure
why
this
is
typical
shipyard
massmarket
artificially
flavored
bud
lite
nonsense
i
know
this
crap
is
a
money
maker
for
them
but
its
too
bad
because
theyre
a
more
capable
brewery
than
this
interesting
beer
spices
seems
close
but
not
quite
right
ginger
flavor
is
old
not
fresh
tasting
nor
spicy
smells
ok
thin
and
slightly
sweet
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
sour
not
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
not
all
that
impressive
i
will
not
waste
my
money
on
this
one
again
if
you
have
had
shipyards
pumkin
head
and
loved
it
and
you
enjoy
the
flavor
of
ginger
then
this
beer
will
be
enjoyed
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
delicious
treat
to
enjoy
after
a
good
meal
in
front
of
a

it

an
english
brown
ale
if
you
like
gingerbread
u
will
like
this
i
dont
dont
to
drink
this
eeryday
but
once
in
while
would
be
enough
pours
a
medium
brown
color
slight
chill

the
aroma
is
full
of
cinnamon
rolls
sweetness
vanilla

malts
the
taste
has

slight

ginger
cinnamon

work

well
with

and
shipyards
temperamental

drinks
easy
enough
and
has
that

many
are
seeking
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
from
shipyard
like
the
aroma
the
baked
gingerbread
cookie
sensations
are
all
over
the
taste
with
slightly
tart
and
bitter
finish
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
mild
head
looks
very
light
bodied
aroma
is
packed
with
gingerbread
its
completely
dedicated
to
smell
like
gingerbread
it
smells
so
convincingly
onpoint
i
am
sure
its
jampacked
with
artificial
flavoring
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
gingerbread
and
accompanying
spices
light
bodied
zesty
bubbles
lingering
flavor
too
much
flavoring
needs
more
beer
characteristics
overall
this
does
not
even
compare
to
shipyards
pumpkin
brew
i
would
not
try
this
again
nor
recommend
it
to
anyone
unless
they
want
to
experiment
with
flavors
great
beer
had
to
try
it
since
i
love
pumpkin
head
a
very
nice
beer
its
fresh
crisp
beer
enyoyable
a
beer
worth
drinking
overall

as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
its
hard
to
find
one
that
stands
up
to
the
definition
of
craft
but
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
and
it
probably
gets
a
worse
rep
than
it
should
shipyard
applehead
is
a
beer
you
drink
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
but
also
apples
this
is
not
cloying
or
overly
sweet
in
fact
its
more
beer
than
it
is
apples
however
if
you
want
apples
its
there
and
it
will
satisfy
your
craving
for
an
apple
flavored
beer
id
drink
it
again
i
may
even
consider
a
six
pack
on
sale
decent
brew
i
feel
like
ive
described
this
beer
in
the
best
ability
i
can
gonna
finish
this
one
on
the
couch
in
front
of
the
tube
another
fking
screwtop
i
am
wasting
my
mad
cappopping
skills
on
these
things
this
makes
woody
angry
and
much
like
the
incredible
hulk
when
i
get
angry
i
become
even
stronger
inverted
pour
from
a
bottle
that
is
indicative
of
just
how
angry
it
made
me
the
twoplus
fingers
of
ecru
foam
popped
and
fizzed
like
i
had
poured
myself
a
glass
of
pop
color
was
a
deep
golden
yellow
srm
5
7
with
neplus
quality
clarity
allowing
me
to
see
into
the
future
my
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
unholy
trio
of
mammon
midas
and
croesus
all
of
whom
wanted
a
taste
i
took
a
deep
sniff
and
the
apple
odor
was
so
prevalent
that
i
thought
of
golden
delicious
and
when
i
said
this
they
ripped
the
glass
from
my
hands
and
began
chugging
it
in
earnest
too
much
gelt
for
me
so
i
opened
another
for
myself
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
but
the
taste
was
like
apple
pie
apples
certainly
but
underlain
with
at
least
cinnamon
wild
and
completely
unexpected
the
finish
was
dry
mostly
because
of
the
spice
but
this
was
a
very
pleasant
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
would
recommend
this
on
a
seasonal
basis
like
right
now
looks
like
a
carbonated
apple
juice
i
believe
amongst
the
johnny
appleseed
ales
the
reds
apple
ale
and
the
ab
version
of
shocktop
this
was
the
trailblazer
amongst
the
recent
trend
it
pours
with
a
fizzy
white
head
quickly
fading
to
nothing
not
much
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
sweet
candy
apple
upfront
with
some
cinnamon
spice
to
blend
into
a
pseudo
apple
pie
mix
i
could
picture
locals
here
dropping
apple
pie
moonshine
boilermakers
into
this
one
the
flavor
is
spice
heavy
with
cinnamon
sitting
on
the
palate
through
each
sip
and
not
fresh
ground
cinnamon
the
one
thats
been
in
your
moms
spice
cabinet
since
you
were
a
kid
mouthfeel
is
pretty
well
carbonated
tickles
the
back
of
your
throat
becomes
a
bit
hard
to

overall
not

i
would

not

lacking
a
little

stays
firm
and
consistent
keeping
up
nicely
overall
i
had
this
with
an
arepa
and
yucca
fries
and
it
was
a
decent
complement
to
the
meal
its
kind
of
an
odd
seasonal
beer
though
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
squarely
into
any
one
season
my
thing
with
fruit

is
that
i
rarely
get
then
urge
to
have
them
more

once
i
dont
want
to
disregard
them
all
as
gimmicky

its

unique
for
sure
it
was

to
clear
looking
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
apple

cinnamon
aromas
that
got
me
past
the

look
of
the
beer
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
decent
and
thats
certainly
the
case
some
of
the

suggested
make
it

skip

this
is
a

this

a
great

beer
that
manages
to
mimmic
apple
pie
with
the

apples
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
as
a
standalone
pale
wheat
ale
this
one
is
way
off
the
mark
it
is
definitely
more
of
a

its
a

overall
not

too
sweet
and
to
much

o
this
is
an
above

beer
the
spices
come
out
great
in
the
nose
but
tend
to
cross
each
other
up
in
the
flavor
overall
much
better
than

up

offering
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
although
this
is
billed
as
a
spiced
beer
and
it
is
the
spices
along
with
the
high
10
5
alcohol
content
make
it
a
good
choice
for
a
winter
warmer
lots
of
booze
here
which
was
a
bit
of
a
detriment
to
this
beer
it
felt
strong
and
certainly
put
the
warmer
into
this
stylistically
while
this
was
enjoyable
there
wasnt
a
lot
here
that
made
this
stand
out
and
one
would
certainly
be
enough
for
a
sitting
the
spices
werent
overwhelming
like
in
a
wassail
and
on
a
cold
winters
night
this
would
be
a
fair
choice
even
without
any
accompanying
food
the
sweetness
makes
this
more
than
a
dessert
unto
itself
d
drinks
like
a
belgian
tripel
with
the
added
spice
of
the
holiday
season
pretty
fucking
enjoyable
if
you
ask
me
if
you
want
a
strong
belgian
styled
holiday
brew
this
one
should
suffice
and
then
some
o
not
for
me
at
this
age
i
will
cellar
it
and
report
as
my
gut
tells
me
thats
what
it
needs
i
liked
this
one
like
i
said
the
aging
has
helped
this
one
most
likely
but
the
overall
product
is
a
solid
one
great
for
the
holidays
a
complex
full
bodied
drink
a
nice
seasonal
ale
to
be
savored
good
warming
feel
here
nice
big
brew
man
i
saw
this
at
the
only
place
in
pittsburgh
to
carry
it
and
couldnt
wait
to
try
what
a
disappointment
way
too
much
funk
going
on
here
its
flat
and
tastes
like
a
bad
apple
cider
with
tons
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
yuk
its
extremely
boozy
and
doesnt
go
down
easy
tart
sour
it
smells
like
a
caramel
apple
but
in
true
honesty
it
tastes
like
a
bad
version
of
the
brewers
best
belgian
dubbel
home
brew
kit
with
little
to
no
carbonation
and
lots
of
spices
dumped
in
not
a
fan
reading
the
other
reviews
this
could
have
been
a
bad
bottle
confused
the
cork
would
not
twist
out
and
i
had
to
get
it
out
with
a
wine
cork
opener
overspiced
overly
alcoholic
overly
aggressive
a
very
good
beer
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
short
experience
after
the
first
sip
but
this
one
really
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
a
bit
if
i
had
to
drink
a
winter
warmer
it
might
be
this
one
itd
certainly
keep
my
guts
warm
at
least
overall
i
couldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
but
dont
understand
the
complaint
on
too
spiced
seems
just
as
spiced
as
balanced
as
the
devious
pumpkin
beer
i
guess
if
i
could
find
a
four
pack
for
around
10
dollars
this
beer
would
be
quite
a
holiday
favorite
definitely
tastes
like
christmas
and
has
its
high
points
but
it
just
a
bit
too
much
not
really
getting
any
of
the
belgian
influence
though
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
khaki
colored
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
and
edging
the
edging
leaves
some
sticky
lace
strands
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
inviting
there
is
aromas
of
nutmeg
cinnomon
ginger
and
a
candied
yeast
aroma
the
aroma
is
big
and
bold
the
taste
follows
suit
but
isnt
as
big
the
taste
has
a
candied
yeast
up
front
with
notes
of
nutmeg
cinnomon
and
spice
in
the
middle
an
alcohol
taste
comes
through
at
the
back
end
and
there
is
a
big
of
a
cough
syrupy
aftertaste
if
you
leave
it
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
moderately
to
lowly
carbonated
overall
it
is
solid
for
the
style
the
taste
falls
a
little
bit
off
from
the
aroma
but
still
a
good
beer
appears
a
nice
dark
brownishred
smells
very
fruity
with
undertones
of
cinnamon
clove
and
ginger
the
first
half
of
the
taste
was
excellent
but
i
think
this
beer
finishes
weak
i
would
have
liked
the
flavors
to
be
more
bold
to
take
away
the
punch
of
the
alcohol
i
think
with
some
minor
tweaks
this
could
be
an
excellent
holiday
beer
but
for
now
its
just
above
average
in
my
eyes
appears
to
be
a
deep
shade
of
brown
in
my
glass
barely
translucent
its
got
a
slightly
offwhite
soda
head
which
recedes
to
about
14
inch
very
inviting
aroma
in
which
the
spices
dominate
cherry
vanilla
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
reminds
me
of
the
spices
used
in
pumpkin
ales
very
sweet
malty
taste
its
good
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
heavy
on
cloves
and
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
boozy
might
put
some
people
off
im
ok
with
the
amount
of
warming
going
on
here
this
is
a
good
selection
for
being
snowed
in
i
would
drink
this
again
its
a
decent
brew
cloudy
medium
amber
in
appearance
smell
is
foral
to
the
nose
this
smells
nice
mouthfeel
is
nice
leaves
well
and
very
clean
taste
we
got
it
all
here
this
beer
is
a
nice
blend
of
spices
this
is
an
exceptional
belgian
style
ale
get
some
overall
we
found
this
brew
to
be
very
enjoyable
not
to
mention
that
the
abv
is
quite
nice
we
had
this
with
some
scotch
eggs
respect
the
beer
fridge
worthy
d
pretty
good
holiday
brew
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
although
present
its
very
sweet
and
spicy
but
not
cloying
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
i
like
the
idea
of
this
beer
but
not
so
much
the
execution
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
flavors
are
mild
and
there
is
not
much
complexity
o
nice
appearance
and
nose
if
you
look
past
the
booze
although
the
warming
effect
is
quite
nice
the
booziness
is
out
of
control
and
the
spices
are
rather
cloying
enjoyed
at
the
brew
pub
in
downtown
allentown
this
special
brew
is
served
in
a
tulip
glass
it
shows
a
deep
but
clear
rosy
copper
color
with
a
nice
fuzzy
offwhite
head
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
definitive
yet
tasteful
sweet
clove
and
cinnamon
allspice
with
a
bayberry
kiss
very
nice
and
tempting
the
taste
buds
catch
a
beautifully
christmasy
bubblegum
hop
and
grain
mixed
seamlessly
with
a
green
leaf
edge
this
is
pretty
close
to
being
full
bodied
but
it
has
lots
of
active
carbonation
that
makes
the
feel
a
bit
lighter
and
frothy
so
it
goes
down
a
little
easier
almost
overcarbonated
perhaps
the
sweetness
is
definitely
a
bit
cloying
so
i
think
this
would
go
best
with
some
form
of
foodcheese
to
help
cut
it
a
little
the
taste
definitely
suggests
the
holidays
but
it
doesnt
bring
any
clear
cranberry
or
cinnamon
or
whatever
to
me
the
prevailing
flavor
is
the
very
sweet
bubblegum
and
the
rest
is
a
subtle
mix
that
generally
works
but
gets
a
little
old
kind
of
fast
personally
in
small
quantities
its
a
real
nice
christmas
brew
at
12
ounces
it
seems
a
little
tedious
o
the
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
it
does
mask
the
alcohol
level
if
thats
what
you
want
i
would
prefer
a
lower
abv
less
spicy
beer
personally
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
lots
of
christmas
spices
in
it
the
only
real
problem
i
had
with
it
was
the
overt
amount
of
booze
in
it
very
good
worth
getting
poured
with
a
flourish
leaving
a
a
nice
light
tan
head
of
very
fine
bubbles
that
settled
into
a
tight
collar
spicy
nose
with
cinnamonnutmeg
being
most
prominent
then
yeasty
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
i
expected
kinda
on
the
light
side
the
taste
however
was
very
nice
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
then
the
spices
followed
by
a
nice
alocohol
warmth
goes
down
easy
i
like
this
one
its
no
mad
elf
but
warrants
seeking
out
ill
buy
again
your
mouth
feels
clean
at
the
finish
with
a
small
taste
of
spices
leftover
this
a
beer
you
drink
one
of
as
it
is
10
5
abv
it
sure
is
a
holiday
beer
and
very
different
a
nice
job
from
the
small
brewery
in
allentown
and
thanks
to
jason
from
epps
beverage
for
giving
it
to
me
to
try
give
it
a
try
it
is
very
different
i
give
it
a
4
0
overall
rating
not
a
bad
beer
really
it
does
work
to
a
certain
degree
but
it
is
quite
spicy
i
am
not
disappointed
rude
elf
has
a
malty
body
and
a
spicy
finish
the
body
is
above
medium
but
does
not
seem
overly
carbed
up
which
i
feel
works
best
with
this
style
whatever
it
is
just
seems
a
bit
over
spiced
and
a
bit
underattenuated
the
alcohol
heat
does
not
help
i
dont
see
why
this
has
to
be
so
high
in
alc
content
and
i
think
thats
whats
holding
the
rude
elf
back
the
spices
may
be
a
touch
overwhelming
and
are
quite
varied
given
the
style
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
given
the
style
certainly
worth
a
try
ba
crimson
liquid
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
this
beer
is
a
treat
the
smell
is
a
great
mix
of
spices
cinnamonlike
scents
sticks
out
and
malt
toffee
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
crust
the
state
is
quite
strong
lots
of
alcohol
this
is
a
sipping
beer
warming
and
moderately
fruity
dark
rumsoaked
fruit
some
esters
and
belgiansytle
phenols
full
body
this
is
a
solidly
good
holiday
beer
the
flavor
brings
forward
a
large
amount
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
allspice
some
clove
and
booze
are
there
as
well
there
is
some
light
sweetness
in
the
background
moderate
yeast
character
though
not
much
body
is
somewhat
light
for
the
style
though
id
say
more
toward
medium
overall
low
to
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
a
bit
strange
and
full
of
spices
without
much
else
no
real
belgian
character
not
a
big
fan
overall
i
like
that
this
is
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
5
beer
and
it
had
some
nice
spice
to
it
that
being
said
it
lacked
the
complexity
and
blls
that
a
beer
of
this
style
should
have
worth
a
try
if
someone
has
them
in
their
basement
but
i
would
not
pay
for
this
again
either
way
cheers
drinkabilty
its
a
sipper
for
sure
i
think
that
the
body
doesnt
complement
the
high
abv
too
well
but
overall
its
something
worth
trying
do
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
sipper
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
ive
had
beers
that
had
bigger
percentages
of
alcohol
but
they
hid
their
potency
better
than
rude
elf
did
personally
i
would
have
liked
the
spices
and
booze
to
have
been
toned
down
a
notch
and
the
belgian
yeast
characteristics
to
have
been
upped
a
notch
i
imagine
that
putting
this
beer
in
the
cellar
for
one
or
two
years
will
result
in
a
very
good
beer
theres
definitely
better
bsdas
out
there
but
if
you
can
find
a
single
of
this
go
for
it
cheers
d
i
was
never
really
one
to
get
overly
excited
about
winterchristmas
beers
but
this
one
has
resurrected
an
interest
to
explore
this
particular
style
very
enjoyable
i
could
handle
maybe
two
of
these
three
pushing
the
limits
this
is
a
really
well
brewed
beer
great
job
this
beer
needs
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
to
round
out
the
alcohol
heat
and
hopefully
the
spices
will
settle
the
flavors
come
across
as
a
bit
disjointed
but
time
would
likely
help
blend
things
together
i
found
this
highly
enjoyable
overall
and
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
on
tap
at
the
allentown
location
pours
a
deep
red
clear
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
lots
of
spices
ginger
cinnamon
gingerbread
clove
flavor
again
is
dominated
by
the
spices
mentioned
above
heavy
mouthfeel
this
was
just
a
little
overkill
for
me
with
all
the
spices
and
alcohol
the
rude
elfs
reserve
was
definitely
worth
the
trip
everything
you
could
have
hoped
from
a
belgian
holiday
beer
the
green
apple
flavors
were
amazing
and
perfectly
placed
with
the
other
spices
and
candi
a
12
gallon
growler
was
going
for
about
25
so
i
didnt
get
one
but
im
kicking
myself
now
guess
ill
have
to
wait
until
next
year
to
have
one
again
not
a
big
spiced
ale
fan
but
if
they
were
all
like
this
one
it
might
change
my
mind
must
have
been
old
will
revisit
i
have
been
getting
really
really
into
the
italians
lately
and
these
guys
are
among
the
best
this
is
a
cool
little
beer
definitely
overpriced
but
they
all
are
i
feel
like
from
italy
a
wheat
base
it
feels
like
hazy
and
just
bronzed
a
little
with
a
tall
white
head
it
smells
herbal
but
i
cant
place
any
of
the
herbs
its
not
quite
tea
not
quite
dried
flowers
not
quite
citrusy
but
in
proximity
to
all
of
that
still
it
seems
simpler
than
that
on
the
taste
delicate
for
sure
with
a
really
distinct
and
pungent
yeast
strain
and
a
definitely
fruit
quality
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
sweetness
like
clover
honey
brings
it
together
and
the
hops
are
like
dried
straw
in
a
field
carbonation
is
awesome
feel
is
rich
and
round
for
what
it
is
i
had
a
really
hard
time
picking
out
exactly
what
the
spices
in
here
were
but
the
whole
is
a
really
nice
drink
i
wish
we
could
get
four
packs
of
this
for
what
single
bottles
cost
thats
my
only
complaint
o
hmmm
guessing
this
might
be
a
tad
aged
i
would
imagine
this
would
smell
and
taste
much
more
dynamic
fresh
the
way
it
stands
now
ive
had
several
american
beers
ipas
that
taste
quite
similar
to
this
minus
the
peculiar
peppery
element
curious
to
try
it
again
just
have
to
be
willing
to
fork
over
the
dough
otra
vez
dark
cloudy
unfiltered

fairly

great

delicious
i
had
two
glasses
when
at
a
restaurant
tonight
and
want
more
o
very
enjoyable
if
you
like
your
beers
on
the
sweeter
side
o
this
beer
has
an
interesting
mix
of
herbs
and
spices
but
these
arent
overpowering
it
is
a
nice
one
to
sip
and
savor
d
very
good
herbed
beer
wellbrewed
great
spice
taste
not
too
overpowering
and
very
nice
malt
flavoring
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
light
belgian
style
or
herbed
beers
maybe
my
senses
are
off
or
the
style
doesnt
suit
me
not
impressed
i
am
glad
i
saved
this
for
a
special
occasion
as
it
deserved
my
full
attention
this
review
is
a
little
bittersweet
as
this
is
the
last
of
the
brews
i
brought
back
from
my
italy
trip
alas
now
all
i
have
left
are
my
memories
high
carbonation
works
well
thanks
to
cameron
thebishopco
for
this
brew
o
this
is
pretty
interesting
as
the
beer
initially
has
a
smell
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
that
then
the
spicy
notes
really
come
out
and
take
over
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
to
both
enjoyable
but
not
sure
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
o
overall
a
stand
out
beer
and
a
surprise
since
ive
never
heard
of
it
great
melding
of
flavors
with
fruit
and
spice
a
great
beer
to
have
anytime
but
i
would
especially
like
on
a
cold
holiday
night
around
a
fire
with
family
and
friends
o
what
a
unique
brew
i
cant
identify
half
of
the
flavors
in
this
one
no
idea
what
myrrh
or
kamut
is
but
i
can
tell
you
that
is
has
quite
a
complex
variety
of
wellbalanced
flavors
and
they
are
all
pretty
damn
good
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
albeit
quite
unusual
and
unique
not
in
a
bad
way
either
not
sure
id
pay
20
for
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
stands
alone
in
its
category
never
had
anything
even
remotely
similar
to
this
one
2006
edition
bright
sparkly
golden
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
stays
smells
of
tart
cider
apple
pie
but
without
the
crust
little
citrus
tastes
ciderlike
apple
pie
mush
tart
sour
notes
light
cinnamon
pear
light
in
body
with
prickly
carbonation
o
a
very
interesting
and
complex
spiced
beer
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
8
45
oz
bottle
but
thats
all
they
had
in
stock
definitely
recommended
i
am
really
glad
to
have
come
across
this
a
great
beer
and
something
i
will
grab
in
the
future
if
i
see
it
recommended
o
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
complex
and
interesting
golden
orange
clear
body
a
finger
of
quick
dissipation
head
some
visible
carbonation
cedar
dominates
the
nose
significant
myrrh
backbone
with
orange
pith
not
peel
citrus
notes
floral
hops
the
ginger
is
prominent
tastewise
though
the
cedar
and
especially
the
myrrh
adds
complexity
not
very
hoppy
more
botanical
than
spicy
imo
mouthfeel
is
medium
decent
effervescence
a
nice
end
to
a
epic
day
of
beer
tasting
pairs
well
with
italian
cookies
o
an
odd
beer
nice
to
taste
but
immensely
difficult
to
analyse
overall
i
really
enjoyed
nora
the
perfumed
notes
which
i
will
presume
to
be
the
myrrh
added
an
extra
dimension
to
an
already
solid
belgian
pale
ale
if
it
werent
so
expensive
i
would
be
happy
to
buy
this
again
overall
this
has
suddenly
jumped
into
my
top
5
beers
highly
recommended
to
have
with
breadcrackers
absolutely
delicious
this
poured
out
with
a
hazy
golden
color
and
a
decent
sized
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
retention
is
gone
within
minutes
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
a
little
boozy
with
some
nice
soft
wheat
like
aromas
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
spicy
it
has
elements
of
pepper
and
it
also
has
some
hints
of
apple
and
orange
in
there
the
spices
really
set
this
off
the
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
a
sting
to
it
the
tastebuds
are
left
tingling
and
dry
after
each
sip
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
really
interesting
if
the
price
tsg
was
a
little
lower
i
could
see
myself
buyin
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
really
interesting
spicy
ale
o
a
very
interesting
beer
very
different
from
anything
i
have
had
before
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
lot
going
on
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
often
because
of
the
price
but
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
have
this
all
the
time
highly
recommended
a
pleasant
quite
sweet
beer
lots
of
wheat
beer
notes
here
most
of
the
flavours
here
are
really
lifted
from
page
one
of
how
to
brew
a
wheat
beer
exceptionally
fresh
and
drinkable
and
very
very
refined
it
reminds
me
in
some
ways
of
a
bière
de
champagne
certainly
the
dry
finish
and
sophistication
give
it
this
character
the
spices
are
so
beautifully
done
they
complement
the
style
and
the
flavour
of
the
beer
and
never
seem
like
a
gimmick
in
fact
this
beer
almost
makes
you
feel
like
this
is
how
beer
should
be
made
o
ive
known
of
this
beer
for
years
but
never
got
around
to
trying
it
since
its
so
expensive
seeing
it
ontap
i
jumped
on
the
chance
quite
a
good
beer
complex
very
tasty
a
contemplative
effort
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
chewy
sweet
up
front
sugary
filling
out
the
palate
with
a
viscous
wheat
body
and
mild
tart
notes
with
smoothness
running
down
the
tongue
with
a
semi
dry
finish
pours
hazy
tinted
golden
color
with
all
kinds
of
stuff
floating
around
in
there
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
at
first
but
the
more
i
smell
the
more
i
get
a
sweet
citrus
fruit
tangerine
spicy
with
ginger
taste
it
is
hard
to
describe
it
perfectly
it
has
some
sourness
to
it
which
i
wasnt
expecting
but
it
is
balanced
with
sweet
citrus
strange
aftertaste
kinda
metalic
maybe
the
myrrh
medium
body
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
imo
very
clean
tasting
very
good
drink
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
italy
poured
into
a
standard
italian
table
wine
glass
and
drunk
from
the
apartment
terrace
in
spolleto
may
2011
have
been
seeking
to
further
my
baladin
education
and
this
one
is
the
best
for
me
so
far
the
complexities
begin
with
the
nose
honeyed
sour
sweet
excellent
head
on
the
pour
great
glass
lacing
the
belgian
yeast
makes
for
a
candied
carbonation
the
first
sip
discerns
a
taste
profile
that
reminds
me
of
duvel
only
deeper
richer
the
color
and
the
glass
lacing
are
the
same
but
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
wasnt
sure
of
the
spice
notes
thought
ginger
and
per
ba
i
guess
i
am
right
othe
spices
i
cannot
identify
but
find
this
beer
extremely
extremely
drinkable
and
balanced
great
finish
makes
me
more
than
ready
for
the
next
sip
no
discernable
alchohol
burn
the
beer
is
so
smooth
would
pair
with
a
fish
or
chicken
couscous
would
be
so
yummy
a
great
eyeopening
beer
from
a
gamechanging
and
everevolving
brewery
ws
overall
imo
not
that
great
my
friends
thought
so
as
well
someone
mentioned
it
reminded
them
of
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
which
i
agreed
with
definatly
not
worth
the
12
price
tag
and
that
was
on
sale
one
of
the
most
wine
like
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
a
really
well
puttogether
and
easy
drinking
spiced
beer
that
wont
offend
anyone
overall
this
italian
product
of
egyptian
influence
certainly
exceeded
my
expectations
which
were
moderately
high
the
egyptians
must
have
had
it
pretty
good
if
their
beer
was
anything
like
this
this
is
a
prime
example
of
excellence
in
beer
ladies
and
gents

no

too

for
my

and
different

are
hard
to
distinguish
dryness
of
the
acids

carbonation
gives
a
spicy
and
snappy
finish
after
the
fullness
of
the
bubbly
senesation
first
the
mid

is
firm
and
medium
that
allows
for
a
characterful

the
early
expansion
to
the

spicy
dryness

peel
with
some
spices
and
banana
yeastiness
the
body
is
full
and
coating
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
yeasty
orange
finish
there
is
an
acidity
that
makes
this
beer
great
with
food
beer
is
medium
in
bodied
and
finishes
pretty
dry
it
tastes
like
flowers
its
very
flavorful
like
lavender
and
tea
leaves
its
deceptively
strong
flavored
interesting
but
probably
not
my
cup
of
tea
lets
start
with
the
bottle
it
sets
up
the
whole
experience
with
nora
its
a
unique
shape
for
a
unique
beer
the
beer
itself
is
exquisite
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
so
far
i
have
tried
nora
and
super
and
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
brewery
d
very
drinkable
only
knock
is
a
slight
booziness
for
the
6
8
needs
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
but
very
nice
beer
overall
d
high
delicate
and
well
done
it
brings
good
reputation
to
the
new
generation
of
italian
beers
pale
strong
with
herbs
floating
around
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
pour
is
a
cloudy
golden
thought
i
was
getting
a
saison
at
first
but
the
head
was
leaner
nose
was
very
herbal
quite
of
bit
of
licorice
and
peppery
hops
palate
was
just
that
pepper
licorice
coriander
and
a
bit
of
an
astringent
citrus
sweet
extremely
herbal
undetectable
abv
in
all
a
good
beer
but
not
living
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
is
good
a
really
nice
belgian
style
ale
complex
without
being
overwhelming
to
the
palate
digestible
and
smooth
still
one
750ml
bottle
is
plenty
poured
a
moderate
gold
with
a
few
orange
highlights
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
bubbles
the
nose
is
full
of
spices
along
with
some
citrus
and
a
tiny
bit
of
earthiness
flavor
takes
it
up
another
notch
with
loads
of
wellbalanced
spice
and
intricacies
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
good
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
as
the
brew
is
intense
yet
quite
quaffable
d
interesting
but
difficult
to
finish
is
this
really
a
beer
feel
and
drinkability
body
is
mediumheavy
with
low
carbonation
alcohol
seems
to
creep
through
a
bit
low
carbonation
helps
to
complete
this
one
upon
closer
inspection
i
think
that
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
and
the
spicesespecially
the
oakinesspineyfragrant
incensegives
off
a
minty
type
of
deal
like
a
menthol
cigarette
but
not
as
obnoxious
or
as
strong
this
is
one
that
ill
gladly
drink
the
rest
of
and
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
again
such
a
unique
beer
if
you
see
this
grab
it
drinkability
not
a
particularily
memorable
ale
and
not
knowing
the
additives
did
nothing
to
aid
the
drinking
experience
split
a
large
bottle
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
they
say
the
beer
has
some
egyptian
inpriation
but
it
basically
drinks
and
tastes
like
a
spiced
belgian
pale
ale
its
very
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
with
obvious
orange
peel
and
a
white
pepper
finish
there
are
hint
of
ginger
along
with
the
vanilla
spice
and
white
bread
if
you
dont
mind
the
spice
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
orangegold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smells
very
spicy
with
loads
of
ginger
and
something
else
that
im
guessing
is
myrrh
slightly
citric
floral
and
with
an
overall
bready
malt
character
the
same
spices
are
strong
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
floral
notes
and
some
earthy
character
quite
tangy
overall
with
a
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
that
is
pretty
effervescent
interesting
to
be
sure
though
overspiced
d
fine
drinkability
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
baladin
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
last
week
with
a
spanish
dish
of
roast
pork
loin
stuffed
with
figs
prunes
probably
the
best
food
beer
match
i
ever
had
would
do
amazingly
well
with
real
sharp
cheeses
and
the
fruit
perserves
that
are
often
served
alongside
i
reckon
its
expensive
but
i
plan
to
keep
a
bottle
on
hand
at
all
times
i
cant
say
that
i
understand
this
beer
but
i
like
it
just
dont
know
how
much
i
could
drink
ok
still
not
sure
what
to
think
drinkability
is
pretty
good
less
the
phlegm
i
like
it
then
i
dont
like
it
then
i
like
it
again
worth
a
try
purchased
at
whole
foods
on
the
bowery
with
a
bottle
of
sella
del
diavolo
and
nice
chouffe
08
poured
into
a
lucifer
snifter
first
impressions
the
color
is
definitely
a
saison
orangeamber
hue
with
the
color
of
clover
honey
thin
pure
white
head
with
persistent
retention
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
pungently
bitter
herbs
and
orange
this
is
certainly
a
good
looking
beer
but
something
suprising
is
how
little
effervescence
there
is
in
this
its
very
dry
and
the
effect
is
somewhat
flat
on
the
tongue
flavor
throws
a
kind
of
a
curve
ball
too
it
was
barnyardy
haylike
and
with
a
strong
perfume
of
myrrh
i
know
this
beer
is
brewed
with
an
ancient
egyptian
grain
and
this
drinks
like
an
ancient
recipe
i
drank
this
solo
and
i
think
its
better
suited
to
drinking
with
food
than
enjoying
on
its
own
overall
this
is
one
interesting
beer
although
im
on
the
fence
about
how
much
i
like
it
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
i
think
one
will
be
enough
quite
the
holiday
treat
and
a
nice
beer
to
see
on
draft
in
the
nw
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
yeast
malt
spices
and
fruit
the
appearance
is
hazy
amber
gold
the
head
is
decent
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
ok
but
nothing
special
this
is
another
disappointment
with
a
nice
bottle
but
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
other
reviews
well
explain
the
tasteall
i
can
add
is
the
notable
drinkabilityyou
can
justify
it
with
the
curiosity
but
when
you
are
aware
of
the
6
8
abv
all
you
can
say
is
good
beer
good
stuff
d
this
one
was
pretty
drinkable
nice
spice
refreshing
glad
i
tried
this
d
moderate
drinkability
but
failed
to
leave
me
wanting
more
t
my
first
reaction
was
celery
seed
even
cold
the
spices
came
through
nicely
i
dont
know
whats
in
there
exactly
but
it
sure
is
good
theres
a
hint
of
sourness
in
the
background
but
nothing
on
the
level
of
a
lambic
maybe
a
little
coriander
in
there
very
interesting
stuff
like
a
flemish
red
crossed
with
dr
browns
celray
finishes
very
dry
delicious
superdrinkable
i
dont
usually
associate
spiced
beers
with
summer
brews
but
this
one
was
crazy
refreshing
on
a
blazing
hot
day
would
go
great
with
indian
food
i
think
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
with
complex
flavors
slowly
coming
to
the
forefront
the
more
i
tasted
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
sudden
blast
of
bubbles
as
it
hits
the
top
of
your
mouth
it
would
be
very
easy
to
finish
the
bomber
in
one
sitting
this
bottle
was
purchased
at
winchester
wine
and
spirits
poured
in
to
a
wide
mouthed
wine
glass
a
hazy
orange
with
little
heading
and
lively
carbonation
smell
has
essences
of
honey
chamomile
ginger
cinnamon
and
wild
flowers
all
in
all
very
spicy
in
aroma
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
prickly
spiced
character
that
curiously
sneaks
around
the
palate
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
very
little
alcohol
present
in
the
taste
i
must
say
that
it
was
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
the
spice
and
overall
huge
complexity
make
it
one
that
i
would
drink
in
small
samples
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
an
offwhite
head
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
trace
of
itself
it
smell
earthy
and
spicy
but
not
overpowering
there
is
a
hint
of
a
woody
smell
the
flavor
is
wonderful
not
too
sweet
but
a
little
sweetness
i
taste
orange
but
not
citrusy
it
definitely
has
an
earthy
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
mild
herby
spiciness
it
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
definitely
a
quality
beer
for
some
reason
it
makes
me
crave
jamaican
jerk
chicken
recommended
i
had
neglected
this
too
long
and
was
afraid
the
age
would
have
negatively
affected
it
however
this
drinks
beautifully
my
guess
is
those
spices
help
this
beer
keep
d
a
unique
wellmade
spice
beer
find
this
if
you
can
it
really
does
remind
me
of
dfhs
midas
touch
and
id
love
to
attain
another
bottle
for
a
comparison
a
bit
thin
but
incredibly
drinkable
the
color
of
the
beer
is
dark
golden
moving
toward
orange
capped
off
by
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
sweet
with
some
earthy
herbs
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
complex
sweet
fruit
in
particular
oranges
spiciness
dry
with
some
residual
bitterness
and
acidity
the
finish
is
long
and
dry
this
beer
is
complex
and
very
unique
and
i
like
it
for
that
i
could
finish
off
the
750
ml
bottle
in
no
time
this
beer
is
a
a
total
pleasure
to
drink
at
6
8
abv
it
would
be
all
too
easy
to
drink
two
or
three
if
the
price
tag
wasnt
a
bit
on
the
steep
side
12
or
13
dollars
if
i
recall
correctly
i
originally
chose
a
4
for
drinkability
in
the
pull
down
menu
above
but
as
ive
been
sipping
on
this
fine
ale
and
writing
this
review
i
moved
it
first
up
to
4
5
and
then
finally
to
5
id
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
whether
they
be
a
fan
of
beer
in
general
or
even
a
wine
connoisseur
this
is
certainly
one
for
anybody
who
loves
the
spiced
style
drink
up
amazing
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
usually
a
spiced
beer
is
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
this
beer
almost
defies
classification
good
head
that
deflates
quickly
rich
if
murky
color
and
huge
chunks
of
yeast
upon
pouring
not
much
lacing
some
say
it
is
best
with
food
but
i
think
the
opposite
drink
this
by
itself
to
get
the
full
experience
not
much
hop
presence
if
any
aromas
of
rose
water
nutmeg
and
feminine
musk
a
bit
like
sniffing
panties
while
drinking
beer
drinkability
well
im
drinking
it
the
alcohol
isnt
all
that
much
and
it
would
seem
to
go
over
well
with
many
different
foods
i
like
it
and
would
buy
again
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
would
not
recommend
it
the
mouthfeel
was
one
of
the
highlights
for
me
great
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
feeling
make
this
a
great
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
its
not
packaged
or
priced
like
a
beer
thats
a
session
beer
regardless
i
loved
bits
and
pieces
of
this
while
overall
i
felt
like
it
was
missing
something
dvery
nice
outdoorsy
beer
and
very
good
with
some
brie
goat
cheese
and
brasaola
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
one
i
will
get
again
despite
the
high
price
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
with
a
pretty
nice
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
the
smell
is
intriguing
with
the
aroma
of
lightly
fermented
honey
sweet
orange
peel
fresh
ginger
and
light
muskiness
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
a
good
deal
more
intense
than
the
smell
with
bright
orange
a
sweet
and
sour
flavor
reminiscent
of
fermented
honey
ginger
and
perhaps
some
grapes
as
well
there
is
alittle
bit
of
a
sweet
spicy
hit
on
the
finish
mouthfeelis
creamy
and
spritzy
and
on
the
light
side
very
refreshing
and
quite
interesting

definitely
interested
in
their

reminded

there
wasnt

gingery
taste

se
just
the
sugary
and
spice
mix
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
enjoyed
i
was
drinking
some
unibroues
offerings
previous
to
this
and
that
was
more
of
my
speed
interesting
really
like
a
belgian
ale
with
amped
up
carbonation
and
some
mouth
puckeringdryness
very
champagnelike
but
sweeter
with
the
addition
of
malts
worth
a
try
drinkability
lots
of
unusual
and
interesting
flavors
goign
on
hard
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
however
nora
is
expensive
but
well
worth
it
goes
great
with
roasted
pork
tenderloin
this
brew
is
a
hazy
golden
honeycolored
beer
the
head
is
dense
thick
and
quite
sticky
it
sports
an
interesting
aromaa
wheatlike
twang
a
little
cinnamon
and
sugar
lemon
and
orange
peel
yeast
and
a
slightly
wild
vinous
character
its
a
spritzy
aroma
very
much
alive
and
almost
champagne
like
the
beer
is
moderately
dry
with
a
lot
of
malt
and
spice
flavor
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
and
a
refreshing
dryness
the
spice
with
some
peppery
notes
is
accentuated
in
the
finish
although
im
usually
partial
to
more
traditional
beers
this
one
is
sure
an
interesting
and
flavorful
brew
notes
this
was
a
nights
worth
of
depth
so
many
spices
and
fruits
that
im
spent
and
done
for
the
evening
not
sure
what
could
possibly
follow
this
i
liked
it
and
reccomend
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
with
an
initially
robust
white
head
that
leaves
behind
thick
persistent
lace
sweet
malt
and
ginger
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
of
this
one
unlike
so
many
other
herbedspiced
ales
is
pleasantly
dry
and
more
subdued
its
got
a
nice
ginger
spice
that
is
sharp
but
not
too
overbearing
and
a
nicely
balancing
malty
sweetness
that
features
hints
of
honey
some
definite
pale
malt
fruitiness
and
a
light
graininess
the
overall
flavor
is
rich
spicy
but
still
quite
drinkable
be
warned
though
if
you
just
cant
stand
ginger
in
beer
avoid
this
one
otherwise
highly
recommended
served
from
a
beautiful
champagne
like
bottle
this
was
an
excellent
surprise
when
i
went
for
dinner
at
prune
in
nyc
pours
out
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
champagne
like
head
that
dazzles
then
dissapears
this
has
such
a
complex
and
unique
nose
to
it
almost
like
something
between
a
lambic
and
a
saison
it
has
some
apples
ande
incense
and
ginger
in
the
nose
this
continues
to
develop
into
white
wine
some
spice
like
cinnamon
and
sourness
lemon
soap
the
taste
is
so
very
individual
and
expressive
banana
clove
grass
ginger
rain
citrus
zest
corriandercilantro
flowers
honeysuckle
pepper
and
crysanthimum
i
can
go
on
every
time
i
drink
it
i
get
something
new
wonderful
its
a
little
chewy
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
is
full
of
the
honeysuckle
and
crysanthimum
floralness
theres
no
getting
away
from
it
a
nice
treat
but
honestly
i
can
do
only
so
much
of
it
a
great
beer
experience
its
quite
choice
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
reccomend
it
nora
is
yet
another
unique
italian
beer
that
doesnt
live
up
to
its
reputation
from
where
i
sit
any
brewery
can
come
up
with
a
list
of
ingredients
that
sounds
interesting
on
paper
but
turning
it
into
worthwhile
beer
is
a
whole
nother
matter
maybe
super
baladin
will
be
what
im
looking
for
overall
one
of
the
more
or
most
unique
beers
ive
had
very
interesting
and
quite
delicious
mouthfeel
a
palate
of
ancient
times
of
beating
pyramid
building
and
mummification
a
little
yeasty
but
the
moldy
kind
the
bready
kind
has
a
good
overall
nuance
of
acidity
and
dryness
i
cant
say
thanks
enough
to
tom
at
the
blind
pig
in
champaign
il
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
light
haze
soft
peach
with
copper
highlights
topped
by
a
thick
finger
of
clingy
offwhite
head
beautiful
nose
is
fairly
complex
and
inviting
with
notes
of
lightly
sweet
malt
kinda
sugary
and
marshmallowy
wheat
tang
fruit
banana
mostly
pepper
coriander
and
lots
of
citrus
zest
taste
is
centered
around
soft
tangy
sweet
wheat
malts
notes
of
graham
cracker
and
banana
cocktail
before
spice
and
citrus
zest
take
over
finish
is
yeasty
and
peppery
very
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
very
refreshing
and
complex
different
in
a
gruit
sort
of
way
but
way
citrusier
goes
well
with
lots
of
different
foods
i
bet
75
cl
bottle
12
49
at
lee
edwards
in
roanoke
va
thanks
to
merlin48
for
bringing
this
one
our
way
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
off
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
just
wild
tons
and
tons
of
flowery
aroma
with
a
lemony
kick
the
flavor
is
just
as
odd
tastes
like
chewing
on
flowers
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
pepper
just
wild
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thicker
than
expected
but
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
what
a
strange
and
tasty
brew
so
now
i
know
what
horseblankets
smell
like
hefeweizen
color
of
hazy
gold
small
but
lasting
head
of
white
froth
funky
nose
as
i
said
and
at
first
taste
i
didnt
like
this
beer
a
little
medicinal
and
metallic
and
flavors
i
generally
would
describe
as
tart
after
a
while
this
beer
grew
on
me
and
the
mellowing
effects
did
as
well
alcohol
warmth
combined
with
a
saliva
inducing
sourdough
bread
flavor
and
a
dry
tart
finish
notes
really
nice
label
on
all
the
baladin
brews
i
like
this
style
of
750
bottle
too
just
like
the
deus
definitely
a
bit
pricey
at
12
99
harringtons
in
chelmsford
but
it
is
a
fine
italian
beer
a
big
thanks
to
merlin48
for
giving
me
and
clvand0
the
opportunity
what
a
champ
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
nice
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
sweet
lemoneycitrusy
spicey
and
floral
damn
the
flavor
is
very
floral
kind
of
like
im
drinking
flowers
there
is
a
light
spiceyness
in
there
nit
quite
peppery
but
not
something
i
can
put
my
finger
on
very
interesting
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
slightly
creamy
ith
a
moderate
carbonation
i
really
do
like
this
beer
it
is
nice
to
be
drinking
it
with
the
windows
open
here
in
the
spring
this
one
will
keep
me
really
looking
forward
to
the
other
brew
we
have
from
this
brewery
thanks
again
sam
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
flourescent
orange
color
with
a
tall
fizzy
white
head
a
little
lacing
shows
along
the
glass
aroma
is
of
peaches
and
spices
but
theyre
very
light
here
then
theres
an
acidic
note
like
citric
fruit
taste
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
pale
with
lots
of
spices
added
in
its
a
soft
beer
with
soft
flavors
light
fruits
mix
with
pale
malts
and
other
grains
i
cant
find
any
hops
in
here
spices
take
their
place
and
are
really
the
dominant
show
here
there
might
be
coriander
but
im
only
guessing
here
anyways
the
spices
are
complex
but
overtake
the
other
nuances
that
this
beer
has
finish
is
drying
from
the
spices
and
yeast
but
lingers
a
bit
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
worth
it
for
me
to
spend
the
to
get
this
again
drinkability
i
really
like
this
one
definitely
its
different
than
anything
ive
ever
tried
but
overall
it
has
some
characteristics
of
a
fine
saison
tucked
inside
the
myriad
of
exotic
spices
florals
and
fruits
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
brewed
in
italy
if
i
were
tasting
it
blind
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
is
able
to
poke
through
all
the
complexity
here
0304
is
stamped
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
dont
know
if
that
is
a
bottling
date
or
a
drinkby
date
the
baladin
website
says
this
is
modeled
off
of
an
ancient
egyptian
beer
thats
very
cool
in
my
book
nora
is
cloudy
peachorange
in
color
the
head
is
short
and
creamy
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
of
orange
peels
the
smell
also
contains
just
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
citrusy
spices
are
noted
as
a
means
to
balance
out
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
which
leads
to
great
drinkability
this
seems
like
a
good
choice
for
summertime
this
is
a
little
unusual
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
ive
ever
had
before
it
is
however
quite
tasty
it
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
some
tiny
bits
of
what
i
would
guess
to
be
yeast
and
other
debris
nice
fluffy
white
foamy
head
that
subsides
to
a
thin
white
ring
arong
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
and
certainly
contains
alot
of
spice
and
quite
a
bit
of
an
apricot
smell
the
taste
is
much
less
powerful
than
the
smell
the
taste
like
the
smell
has
some
spice
and
some
apricot
to
it
but
much
less
concentrated
than
the
smell
the
mouth
feel
is
very
pleasant
i
cant
tell
if
it
has
no
carbonation
or
if
it
is
carbonated
but
has
tiny
tightly
knit
bubbles
either
way
its
quite
easy
to
drink
very
pleasant
vaguely
hazy
but
it
is
basically
clear
the
liquid
is
a
beautiful
gold
in
hue
with
a
slight
coppery
highlight
the
head
was
an
active
bubbly
white
foamy
mass
that
rested
gracefully
on
top
of
the
beer
head
retention
was
fair
it
quickly
turned
to
a
soapy
island
with
naked
pockets
thin
collar
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
on
a
whole
the
appearance
is
attractive
the
nose
is
soft
the
potency
is
moderate
in
fact
it
seems
a
little
fickle
at
first
anyway
the
more
i
sniffed
the
more
i
noticed
flowers
a
greenhouse
filled
with
flowers
on
a
sunny
day
can
a
beer
smell
sunny
nora
does
traces
of
fresh
honey
light
sweetness
too
peppery
spicy
ginger
it
seems
fruity
apricots
and
peaches
i
believe
malt
is
crackerlike
herbal
the
nose
is
great
it
is
like
duvel
mixed
with
a
saison
if
the
smell
were
more
forceful
it
would
be
perfection
inviting
the
palate
is
unique
i
translated
a
blurb
on
le
baladins
website
but
that
didnt
quench
my
thirst
on
this
beer
regardless
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beverage
it
is
so
light
in
body
so
soft
with
its
touch
and
yet
some
flavorful
there
are
tons
going
on
with
this
beer
yet
my
tastebuds
dont
get
slaughtered
they
get
rewarded
this
beer
is
amazingly
complex
i
can
think
of
very
few
beers
that
have
such
a
vast
flavor
and
none
taste
like
this
one
the
palate
is
dry
and
sweet
and
spicy
and
herbal
and
fruity
details
the
dryness
is
crackerlike
at
times
however
the
overall
dryness
is
like
brut
champagne
nice
the
sweetness
is
soft
and
playful
kisses
of
honey
very
light
caramel
notes
juicy
fruits
are
in
play
there
is
a
citrus
zip
apricots
peaches
and
a
smidgen
of
grapes
spiciness
seems
to
be
in
part
derived
from
ginger
peppery
then
it
becomes
herbal
towards
the
back
before
ending
on
a
sweet
note
and
the
slightest
bit
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
whole
the
palate
is
very
tasty
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
so
delicate
it
is
beyond
comparison
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
moderately
high
but
not
lively
enough
imo
as
this
beer
is
just
a
little
tacky
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
ideal
for
the
flavor
profile
is
this
beer
drinkable
yes
you
ass
havent
you
been
reading
my
review
the
delicate
flavors
could
be
matched
with
equally
delicate
foods
like
fish
or
waffles
at
brunch
maybe
even
a
very
very
mild
cheese
and
some
rye
crackers
maybe
the
best
pairing
for
this
beer
is
a
couple
glasses
so
it
can
be
shared
with
friends
i
really
like
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
drink
it
again
soon
but
i
havent
seen
it
in
my
usual
hangouts
not
in
nebraska
because
we
dont
get
shit
here
i
mean
in
kansas
city
or
iowa
city
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
burnsville
mn
unforgettable
world
class
drinkability
this
a
smooth
drink
for
special
occasions
would
pair
well
with
any
meal
that
is
heavy
in
carbohydrates
and
salty
its
a
little
expensive
versus
the
beers
quality
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
mellow
pale
malt
scent
with
spices
and
a
fruity
yeast
finish
i
heard
from
someone
that
it
is
supposed
to
have
the
aroma
of
an
old
cathedral
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
spices
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
a
bit
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
spiced
belgian
ale
it
has
it
all
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
good
drinker
poetry
the
acidity
and
sweetness
really
accentuate
the
fresh
apple
character
of
this
beer
also
the
acidity
almost
seems
to
have
a
tamarind
character
to
it
this
is
quite
tasty
and
has
an
herbal
quality
to
it
that
only
adds
to
the
beer
pours
out
a
highly
carbonated
copperish
colour
with
a
big
foamy
snow
white
head
lots
of
must
and
fruit
aromas
ample
head
leaves
lots
of
lace
initial
estery
flavours
of
ginger
honey
melon
apricot
and
orange
all
very
subdued
and
intertwined
malt
tilts
toward
the
caramel
spectrum
although
very
lightly
ghostly
spicy
alcohol
lends
some
pepper
there
is
a
flowery
aspect
of
this
ale
that
im
not
sure
comes
from
the
light
hopping
or
the
fruity
essence
the
mouthfeel
is
astounding
with
all
the
charged
up
carbonation
i
was
expecting
a
soda
like
fizzy
mouthfeel
but
i
am
pleased
at
the
silky
smooth
well
rounded
and
succulent
body
of
this
ale
goes
down
exceptionally
well
some
warming
in
the
belly
is
detected
also
finishes
light
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
musty
fruit
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
nice
quaffer
and
a
sweet
treat
in
summer
recommended
medium
gold
almost
orange
with
a
pale
tan
frothy
and
vigorous
head
candy
citrus
and
mild
bread
notes
on
the
nose
similar
to
a
belgian
pale
ale
imo
sweet
spicy
finish
some
ginger
is
noticable
along
with
some
white
peppercorns
sugary
throughout
slightly
yeasty
finish
good
mouthfeel
overall
flavorful
and
coating
but
not
heavy
a
nice
brew
not
sure
of
the
style
they
were
going
for
belgian
pale
ale
meets
a
spice
beer
i
guess
solid
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
it
pours
out
a
hazey
orange
amber
with
a
large
offwhite
head
sweet
is
there
very
much
but
in
an
unusual
way
almost
belgian
in
style
but
with
a
twist
spicey
turns
down
the
sweets
with
some
citrus
and
pepper
and
maybe
ginger
tastes
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
solid
certainly
worth
checking
out
a
very
good
brew
highly
recommended
and
well
worth
the
coin
took
me
a
while
to
find
it
but
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
cheers
sirjim
john
this
is
a
beer
hardly
to
define
and
to
classify
in
a
style
but
it
is
surely
interesting
to
prove
and
very
good
to
drink
be
aware
of
the
yeast
on
the
bottom
as
i
did
not
know
this
was
bottle
conditioned
i
have
to
say
the
bottle
is
what
got
my
attention
right
away
but
the
beer
itself
stole
the
showpours
a
hazy
orangegolden
with
a
nice
blooming
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
aroma
is
yeastyspiceycitruisy
just
a
mix
of
some
really
good
stuff
taste
is
almost
a
cross
between
a
belgain
pale
and
a
german
hefe
weizen
spicey
and
clovey
with
a
yeasty
sweetness
to
it
with
a
great
citruisy
fruity
taste
that
lingers
and
gives
it
a
great
aftertaste
wow
what
a
great
brew
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
morenext
trip
to
premiere
gourmet
in
buffalo
and
iam
grabbing
three
or
four
comments

i
suggest
refrigerating
this
fifthsized
bottle
in
between
pours
this
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
the
carbonation
levels
are
just
right
the
6
8
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
extremely
drinkable
because
of
its
light
refreshing
texture
and
unique
flavor
not
a
cheap
beer
either
12
in
nj
and
15
in
ny
it
drinks
mostly
like
a
wheat
beer
but
with
a
ton
more
character
and
a
spicy
zing
you
wont
have
ever
encountered
before
p
s
i
didnt
check
the
price
until
checkout
time
and
it
was
11
99
for
this
750ml
bottle
awfully
pricey
compared
to
others
but
there
really
are
no
comparisons
to
this
incredible
brew
so
this
high
tag
may
be
deserved
get
it
highly
recommended
penso
che
questa
birra
abbia
un
sapore
magnifico
a
fabulous
beverage
drinkability
notes
extra
points
for
being
some
damn
interesting
so
flavourful
and
expressive
that
it
annihilated
my
taste
buds
for
the
rest
of
the
night
id
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
midas
touch
from
dogfish
head
and
see
what
comes
of
it
nice
presentation
in
a
custom
shaped
and
embossed
25
4
oz
bottle
with
a
nice
label
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenpeach
body
topped
by
a
full
and
frothy
white
head
that
holds
quite
well
the
nose
is
perfumey
floral
mildly
spicy
ginger
and
lightly
fruity
apricot
with
a
gentle
touch
of
alcohol
very
clean
its
medium
body
combines
with
a
fine
carbonation
to
create
a
gently
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
displays
a
strong
floral
character
gentle
spice
and
light
fruit
over
a
softly
sweet
malt
it
finishes
dry
with
a
light
touch
of
malt
and
a
delicate
spiciness
ginger
a
very
clean
and
somewhat
complex
ale
thats
well
done
and
quite
enjoyable
highly
carbonated
and
almost
champagne
like
hazy
gold
with
a
persistent
white
head
only
slightly
bitter
spiciness
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
with
some
sweet
and
fruit
flavors
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
comes
out
a
bit
more
is
it
a
beer
im
going
to
go
out
and
buy
all
the
time
probably
not
did
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
a
beer
that
tastes
like
pizza
absolutely
i
like
it
the
herby
aroma
and
actual
pizza
taste
rating
this
not
against
other
beers
but
more
for
what
the
aim
was
and
this
beer
is
spot
on
great
paired
with
you
guessed
it
pizza
tastes
like
pizza
if
thats
what
you
were
looking
for
in
a
beer
interesting
novelty
beer
if
i
wanted
pizza
i
would
eat
it
and
not
drink
a
beer
o
interesting
to
try
a
novelty
at
best
this
could
actually
be
a
lot
better
if
they
jacked
up
the
spicing
this
was
likely
an
older
bottle
this
aint
flying
off
the
shelves
maybe
added
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
perhaps
some
toasted
malt
to
enhance
crust
flavors
who
knows
if
i
could
go
back
and
give
myself
advice
last
night
i
would
say
order
it
every
time
but
just
one
and
only
drink
about
10
of
the
16
ounces
which
is
exactly
what
happened
i
was
visiting
my
parents
and
saw
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
local
liquor
store
and
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
i
could
only
handle
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
and
yes
it
does
kind
of
taste
like
pizza
i
mostly
remember
tasting
lots
of
oregano
and
a
bit
of
tomato
the
flavor
wasnt
awful
but
just
not
what
i
would
want
in
a
beer
on
the
other
hand
my
husband
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
delicious
i
actually
think
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
slice
of
ny
pizza
that
would
be
awesome
the
taste
here
is
pretty
damn
bad
but
the
appealing
aroma
and
overall
novelty
of
this
beer
save
it
but
its
still
pretty
bad
worse
than
i
expected
glad
i
tried
it
glad
i
never
have
to
try
it
again
the
aroma
really
is
nice
though
o
better
than
other
reviewers
would
have
made
me
believe
not
a
great
beer
on
its
own
but
certainly
not
bad
paired
with
pizza
quite
wonderful
without
being
distracting
o
ok
that
was
interesting
not
nearly
as
offensive
as
i
expected
it
to
be
it
pulls
off
having
obvious
pizza
flavors
without
rising
to
the
level
of
being
obnoxious
this
is
for
sure
a
novelty
or
fluff
beer
and
less
than
a
halfbottle
should
be
more
than
enough
to
try
but
still
its
interesting
and
different
and
expands
yet
again
what
i
thought
a
beer
could
taste
like
an
interesting
novelty
beer
overall
tastes
like
a
cheese
pizza
if
youd
like
to
drink
your
pizza
and
get
a
tiny
buzz
then
this
is
the
way
to
go
if
youd
rather
not
drink
your
pizza
stay
away
its
hilarious
and
interesting
all
in
the
same
overall
it
isnt
terrible
just
isnt
good
or
worth
drinking
overall
this
isnt
horrid
but
i
cant
feel
like
i
would
ever
want
to
have
this
again
it
tastes
like
watered
down
cheap
pie
in
a
glass
however
it
is
what
it
is
o
this
beer
is
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
especially
after
reading
the
reviews
its
drinkable
especially
for
those
who
like
pizza
no
head
really
on
a
gold
and
burnt
orange
body
with
no
lacing
really
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
are
light
overall
for
the
aroma
you
mostly
get
mozzarella
pale
malts
and
pepperoni
flavor
is
more
herbal
with
the
oregano
coming
through
more
also
your
typical
pizza
flavors
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
worse
each
flavor
is
understated
and
actually
far
better
although
not
good
than
i
imagined
we
had
a
big
beer
tasting
tonight
and
saved
this
for
last
it
could
have
been
the
first
we
had
not
at
all
a
palate
recker
light
in
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
pours
with
a
small
white
head
if
foam
on
a
lightly
hazy
golden
body
an
aroma
of
well
pizza
crust
oregano
tomatoes
everything
and
it
is
actually
not
unpleasant
the
flavor
is
a
more
subdued
version
of
the
same
thing
with
bready
crust
notes
and
subtle
tomato
and
herbal
notes
medium
body
moderately
high
carbonation
and
a
balanced
finish
shockingly
not
bad
the
aroma
is
strange
but
not
really
unpleasant
the
flavor
is
just
mild
and
a
bit
bland
i
expected
something
horrible
and
what
i
got
was
a
bit
odd
but
decent
overall
its
a
bland
blonde
ale
spiced
with
oregano
basil
and
garlic
for
a
pizza
beer
its
rather
boring
in
my
opinion
much
better
than
what
the
average
rater
is
saying
smells
like
frozen
pizza
tastes
like
cheaper
frozen
pizza
with
the
unrisen
dough
has
the
generic
vegipizza
sauce
tastes
its
what
we
expected
right
props
for
a
good
description
that
lives
up
to
the
drink
ive
had
way
worse
spiced
beers
this
one
is
average
to
slightly
better
than
average
and
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
ill
probably
have
one
more
or
even
more
later
in
my
life
i
agree
with
a
previous
post
this
is
much
better
on
a
notsofull
stomach
definitely
drink
before
a
meal
not
afterwards
o
different
strange
this
beer
tastes
really
pizzaey
and
that
might
sound
like
a
strange
idea
but
it
actually
works
perfectly
because
the
beer
is
quite
yeasty
and
tastes
like
pizza
crust
so
the
pizza
flavors
fit
with
it
perfectly
i
guess
on
just
pure
beer
merits
this
is
just
decent
but
the
flavor
is
really
delicious
in
my
opinion
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
theres
nothing
at
all
i
would
fault
this
for
and
the
pizza
flavor
works
surprisingly
well
i
drank
this
from
a
chimay
goblet
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
sweet
oregano
pizza
dough
yeast
with
a
bit
grains
and
light
fruity
notes
palate
is
a
medium
body
fairly
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
finishes
with
a
pizza
dough
oregano
yeast
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
margherita
tomato
pizza
i
actually
enjoyed
this
brew
o
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
very
weird
beer
and
very
unique
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
slightly
below
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
flavors
as
advertised
but
the
savory
pizza
flavors
didnt
go
well
in
the
beer
it
doesnt
keep
me
wanting
to
drink
it
this
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
flavors
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
the
pizza
spices
really
started
to
wear
on
me
and
there
is
no
way
that
i
would
want
to
drink
multiple
bottles
of
this
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
close
to
pizza
the
flavors
was
all
the
key
tastes
that
i
look
for
in
a
pizza
show
up
in
this
beer
it
just
didnt
work
out
that
well
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
the
lingering
tomato
and
spices
flavor
it
just
wouldnt
go
away
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
might
be
interesting
to
try
with
pizza
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
i
do
recommend
trying
it
some
beers
are
so
unique
that
they
have
to
be
tried
once
and
this
beer
is
one
of
them
all
in
all
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
in
my
opinion
they
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
and
it
really
does
taste
similar
to
pizza
its
just
those
arent
flavors
that
i
really
desire
in
a
beer
and
i
dont
really
have
an
urge
to
keep
drinking
i
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
to
come
up
with
and
make
this
weird
brew
but
it
just
wasnt
my
kind
of
beer
it
is
really
a
liquid
pizza
dont
drink
this
with
your
stomach
full
quite
interesting
though
not
sure
i
could
hold
another
one
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
a
buddy
of
mine
had
one
at
his
house
that
someone
gave
him
when
i
opened
it
it
definitely
smelled
like
a
pizza
with
pepperoni
i
thought
it
was
pretty
tasty
it
did
take
a
swallow
or
two
for
my
palate
to
adjust
to
the
flavor
but
after
that
i
thought
it
was
great
i
cant
wait
to
go
buy
a
six
pack
tomorrow
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
cool
concept
and
ill
definitely
drink
it
again
wow
this
was
putrid
i
will
not
even
dare
to
give
this
swill
a
proper
review
other
than
to
say
it
tastes
and
smells
like
a
rancid
pizza
burp
getting
past
the
smell
was
a
major
challenge
when
i
finally
worked
up
enough
courage
to
taste
it
chocking
it
down
was
hell
overall
not
that
good
of
a
beer
and
gets
a
bit
tiring
as
the
glass
empties
interesting
but
not
a
beer
i
can
revisit
thanks
to
millerbuffoon
for
pulling
this
one
out
as
a
joke
and
then
actually
opening
it
for
us
to
try
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
typical
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
honestly
smells
a
lot
like
pizza
or
at
least
pepperoni
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
surprising
not
in
a
good
or
bad
way
but
just
interesting
there
is
actually
elements
of
tomato
basil
oregano
garlic
and
crust
in
this
beer
it
tastes
pretty
freakin
close
to
a
pizza
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
carbonated
well
overall
this
is
a
novelty
but
it
does
taste
and
smell
like
its
intended
too
i
wouldnt
drink
the
beer
again
unless
i
had
too
but
it
was
fun
to
try
with
that
said
a
6
pack
between
a
few
friends
to
critique
would
be
fun
o
the
beer
started
out
interesting
enough
sure
i
played
along
an
ok
visual
an
aroma
of
what
was
expected
though
not
necessarily
enticing
in
the
end
the
flavor
is
what
sends
this
over
the
cliff
pizza
and
beer
are
fine
individually
just
not
together
overall
a
gag
drink
that
will
no
doubt
make
you
gag
in
the
end
a
novelty
sale
only
even
daves
chilli
creek
was
a
bit
more
tolerabe
then
this
one
run
do
not
walk
as
far
away
as
possible
when
you
see
this
a
great
gag
gift
for
that
snobbish
beer
drinker
you
dont
like
how
do
you
think
i
got
a
hold
of
this
cant
expect
much
going
into
a
pizza
flavored
beer
but
it
did
the
job
i
could
go
into
detail
about
the
under
notes
of
it
but
lets
be
honest
your
question
is
did
it
taste
like
pizza
pizza
no
pizza
sause
yea
but
watered
down
sause
and
the
flavor
is
one
that
should
not
be
in
the
consistancy
of
such
a
smooth
liquid
and
it
throws
you
off
your
game
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
expecting
a
murky
reddish
tinted
brew
surprised
to
find
a
mostly
clear
dark
gold
liquid
scent
was
mild
and
had
notes
or
oregano
and
light
vegetable
taste
lead
with
oregano
again
but
tomato
sauce
pokes
through
a
lightly
salty
note
mild
bread
other
faint
notes
of
spice
lighter
side
of
medium
bubbly
bought
due
to
the
novelty
and
was
quite
frankly
afraid
of
what
the
outcome
would
be
overall
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
but
wouldnt
need
to
drink
again
so
they
made
what
they
set
out
to
make
congratulations
really
does
taste
like
drinking
a
pizza
albeit
a
pizza
that
was
liberally
dosed
with
oregano
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
for
the
novelty
factor
but
who
in
their
right
mind
would
willingly
want
one
of
these
much
less
drink
anywhere
close
to
a
full
bottle
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
the
pizza
spices
like
oregano
basil
and
garlic
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
isnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
but
definitely
a
novelty
item
in
the
beer
world
pizza
beer
has
a
golden
orange
glaze
to
itself
with
some
faint
white
bubbles
that
die
off
rather
quick
no
lacing
on
the
sides
there
is
some
small
bubbles
rising
up
so
this
is
not
all
together
dead
this
sure
as
shit
smells
like
a
slice
of
pizza
its
all
there
with
the
basil
and
oregano
showing
off
the
most
yep
just
pizza
in
the
scent
tomatoes
as
well
no
real
beer
scents
just
pizza
well
this
tastes
like
pizza
the
spices
used
pop
out
real
bold
like
with
tomato
pie
flavor
not
hoppy
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
finish
delivered
as
promised
body
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
very
light
the
aftertaste
is
tomato
but
not
long
lingering
this
is
not
something
that
i
will
go
to
at
all
the
flavor
does
not
move
me
like
that
but
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
which
scores
points
in
my
book
o
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
even
eating
it
with
pizza
did
not
improve
it
just
a
ton
of
basil
and
oregano
all
over
the
place
which
is
not
what
i
like
in
a
beer
wouldnt
recommend
checking
out
not
a
bad
oneoff
honestly
tastes
like
something
dfh
wouldve
made
actually
its
like
a
light
version
of
saison
du
buff
you
know
when
you
buy
pizza
beer
mouth
but
it
mostly
smells
like
a
pie
i
expected
a
beer
brewed
with
pizza
spice
this
is
pizza
in
beer
form
i
can
see
no
reason
not
to
try
a
bottle
a
novelty
beer

and
garlic
mmm
but
it
really
isnt
much
definitely
worth
trying
once
travel
and
i
sure
took
my
time
finishing
off
the
glass
may
do
a
bit
better
when
served
with
food
the
taste
is
like
watered
down
pizza
sep

2011
ive
been
wondering
about
this
beer
ever
since
being
repulsed
by
the
sound
of
it
years
ago
time
to
take
it
down
once
and
for
all
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
orangeamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
peppery
cantaloupe
light
basil
cilantro
dark
greens
and
lemon
zest
its
not
very
pizzalike
but
its
also
not
all
that
greatsmelling
either
the
taste
is
where
the
pizza
comes
in
notes
of
watereddown
tomato
juice
basil
plenty
of
garlic
light
biscuit
black
pepper
coriander
and
a
hint
of
what
seems
like
it
could
be
swiss
cheese
most
of
this
hits
in
the
front
but
then
fades
away
into
a
sort
of
spicy
melon
flavor
complete
with
rindy
bitterness
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
this
beer
could
have
been
horrific
instead
it
comes
across
as
muddled
watery
thin
and
generally
uninspired
despite
the
cooky
idea
o
i
was
surprised
how
much
this
actually
smells
and
tastes
like
pizza
sauce
its
a
novel
idea
and
quite
good
but
im
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
it
very
often
its
a
little
confusing
to
drink
a
pizza
id
almost
rather
just
cut
to
the
chase
and
eat
a
piece
of
real
pizza
and
drink
a
wheat
beer
to
compliment
it
the
cpj
sip
it
unless
you
like
shoving
a
whole
piece
of
pizza
in
your
mouth
doverall
this
was
drinkable
for
about
8
oz
then
the
last
4
were
gross
it
was
werid
but
not
horrible
prob
wont
ever
seek
this
out
again
but
it
was
good
to
try
liquid
pizza
once
t
gross
basil
and
tomato
along
with
hints
of
grain
and
yeast
honestly
dont
try
this
its
nearly
undrinkable
so
much
pizza
flavor
here
that
its
nearly
unbearable
this
was
a
drainpour
after
about
three
sips
thanks
terri
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
it
smells
like
an
alien
pizza
sauce
huge
tomato
and
basil
notes
blend
with
oregano
and
garlic
the
vegetal
character
is
just
horrendous
awful
smell
the
flavor
is
just
as
bad
with
a
brutal
blast
of
oregano
and
basil
with
a
disgusting
artificial
tomato
flavor
epicly
bad
stuff
i
gotta
drain
pour
it
i
refuse
to
give
a
second
taste
to
see
if
i
can
pick
out
any
other
flavors
d
well
i
dint
really
like
it
but
ill
finish
a
four
ounce
pour
dnot
terrible
but
not
close
to
the
greatest
pours
a
murky
orange
a
bit
of
white
head
not
really
good
looking
smells
like
butter
and
wheat
maybe
some
tomato
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
buterry
its
kinda
gross
but
i
can
definitely
taste
a
bit
of
pizza
in
it
wheat
tomato
and
oregano
are
fairly
prominent
its
not
awful
but
its
certainly
not
good
d
this
is
not
drinkable
at
all
and
shouldnt
be
on
shelves
in
a
beer
store
ive
read
a
few
reviews
of
this
beer
and
people
have
said
it
actually
tasted
like
pizza
im
not
so
sure
im
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this

you
have
the
advantage
of
choosing
your
own
decent
beer
liquify
it
and
turn
it
into
a
beer
some
hops
i
like
pizza
and
beer
but
not
together
not
worth
2
99
for
a
16oz
bottle
from
liquorama
upland
with
a
dry
tomato
and
basil
aftertaste
big
flavors
but
my
brain
started
over
loading
the
flavor
is
very
light
and
thankfully
doesnt
translate
the
smell
i
just
get
bready
yeast
and
very
grainy
corn
adjunct
that
is
short
and
stinging
it
had
a
garlic
aftertaste
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
it
tastes
and
smells
like
pizza
hard
to
put
a
drinkability
score
as
its
so
strange
im
even
more
appalled
sprecher
would
a
sell
it
in
their
gift
shop
and
b
use
their
logoembossed
bottles
for
this
when
they
only
contract
brew
it
which
is
why
i
wont
tarnish
sprecher
with
a
review
this
terrible
i
love
pizza
if
you
dont
like
it
chug
it
but
not

eric
i
honestly
never

ever

all
the

first
sip
accompanies

well

if
anything

i
could

drink
another
one
of
these
loads
of
bubbles
lining
the
interior
walls
of
the
glass
basil
and

with
the

sauce
this
is
a

its
own
this
beer
is
almost
a
drain
pour
how
ever
halfway
through
the
pint
my
pizza
came
out
of
the
oven
and
made
the
beer
more
tolerable
it
is
a
great
compliment
to
pizza
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
wierd
no
question
the
power
of
garlic
as
with
any
pie
looks
like
hazy
clear
apple
juice
thin
white
head
pretty
average
the
nose
is
either
a
5
or
a
1
so
ill
give
it
a
3
it
really
does
smell
like
pizza
sauce
which
is
quite
disturbing
old
tomatoes
garlic
oregano
some
basil
its
all
there
and
its
all
quite
odd
no
hint
of
the
crust
and
cheese
though
just
canned
pizza
pastesauce
so
weird
taste
is
lacking
much
of
what
was
in
the
nose
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
mostly
watery
tomato
beer
metallic
thin
with
perhaps
a
slight
white
pepper
taste
not
appealing
too
weird
to
drink
much
of
it
bottle
purchased
at
city
wide
and
consumed
with
a
pizza
light
amber
in
color
wispy
white
head
looks
like
a
light
lager
smells
hugely
of
tomato
sause
and
oregano
like
ive
opened
a
contained
of
generic
brand
spaghetti
sauce
i
have
to
say
that
it
smells
perfect
for
the
style
taste
is
a
watered
down
tomato
sauce
with
mild
bland
spices
or
oregano
and
garlic
mostly
just
watery
and
not
really
pizza
like
or
beer
like
very
thin
and
reminds
me
of
miller
lite
eh
no
thanks
even
as
a
joke
pours
a
deep
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
below
average
head
and
below
average
lacing
and
slightly
under
carbonated
smells
of
pizza
spices
hops
tastes
of
oregano
onion
and
garlic
thats
complements
nicely
with
a
the
hops
not
too
bad
actually
this
is
surprisingly
fairly
good
dthis
is
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
betastes
better
than
it
soundsunique
and
worth
checking
out
tasted
on
4708
drinkability
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
it
is
interesting
didnt
try
with
pizza
this
time
worth
trying
it
with
some
once
not
something
i
want
to
drink
often
but
i
hope
the
restaurant
had
fun
doing
this
thanks
for
trying
this
sprecher
why
not
have
some
pizza
beer
with
your
pizza
drinkablility
is
not
too
good
this
is
a
unique
mixture
of
flavors
which
does
not
work
well
in
a
beer
the
flavor
says
something
like
pizza
but
even
that
is
somewhat
of
a
stretch
drinkability
unfortunately
this
in
the
standard
16oz
sprecher
bottle
8oz
would
be
ideal
like
i
said
mad
props
to
the
brewers
of
this
beer
they
created
a
very
unique
and
well
crafted
product
i
dont
like
it
but
i
swear
i
hope
the
area
bars
start
serving
this
i
cant
wait
to
bet
a
coworker
10
bucks
to
drink
two
of
these
for
what
its
trying
to
be
it
hits
the
mark
im
just
not
sure
if
beer
should
be
hitting
this
mark
i
split
this
bottle
with
surlysober
who
bought
it
as
something
of
a
lark
carbonation
i
could
have
seen
this
as
more
of
an
amber
ale
than
a
pale
maybe
some
more
hops
to
balance
the
pizza
though
maybe
the
seefurth
family
tried
that
and
it
didnt
work
there
is
nothing
to
compare
this
one
to
so
if
other
pizza
beers
appear
i
will
rereview
you
may
not
like
the
concept
but
you
have
to
try
it
should
not
be
used
as
a
pizza
replacement
as
a
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
also
not
really
a
good
choice
of
pizza
accompaniments
its
pretty
much
just
what
it
sounds
like
pizza
beer
the
color
looks
like
liquid
pizza
beer
tomato
mber
mixed
wth
parmesan
chee
look
very
hazey
and
deep
with
no
visible
bubbles
and
no
head
one
of
the
most
unique
aromas
ive
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
the
only
time
an
aroma
of
cheese
in
a
beer
is
ok
the
combination
of
pizza
spices
just
makes
me
think
parmesan
cheese
you
can
smell
the
spices
very
well
with
this
beer
the
first
sip
is
up
front
herbal
oregano
and
basil
the
tomato
and
garlic
hit
the
middle
then
all
four
meet
at
the
end
of
the
tongue
to
give
a
powedered
parmesan
pizza
finish
very
vegetal
and
herbal
palate
just
like
liquid
pizza
drinkability
is
low
this
beer
tastes
like
an
unbalanced
pale
ale
with
sprinkles
of
italianpizza
spices
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
primarily
novelty
beer
i
could
see
no
reason
to
try
this
again
nor
would
i
recommend
to
any
serious
beer
drinker
this
may
serve
as
a
caution
against
replicating
nonrelevant
food
flavors
in
beer
maybe
this
would
be
complimentary
with
pizza
but
i
couldnt
vouch
for
that
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
fast
moving
carbonation
that
explodes
with
each
sip
the
body
really
disappointed
me
here
as
i
think
if
it
would
have
been
fuller
it
would
accentuated
the
beer
much
better
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
and
fairly
tasty
being
as
the
spicing
is
not
overpowering
however
i
cant
say
it
leaves
me
wanting
to
run
out
and
drink
it
again
overall
a
well
done
beer
b
a
balanced
and
relaxed
strong
ale
for
me
not
a
maple
bomb
i
expected
but
more
refined
still
solid
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
o
overall
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
beer
faint
maple
more
metallic
than
anything
overall
solid
brew
i
think
it
gets
a
bad
rap
on
here
and
frankly
i
disagree
to
each
their
own
i
personally
think
this
is
a
great
fusion
brew
im
wishing
that
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
bomber
of
this
gourmet
vermont
ale
when
i
had
the
chance
but
with
double
sunshine
and
peril
taking
up
most
of
my
budget
at
lawsons
5th
anniversary
celebration
thats
just
the
way
it
goes
guess
ill
have
to
wait
until
next
april
to
score
multiples
of
this
delightful
elixir
o
interesting
ale
i
was
expecting
something
more
from
this
ale
but
it
was
still
decent
overall
very
uninspired
i
like
maple
beer
but
this
is
dull
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
not
as
mapley
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
the
sweetness
is
nice
o
this
was
ok
very
odd
style
of
beer
wouldnt
really
want
to
try
again
this
beer
is
the
beer
for
maple
lovers
if
you
love
maple
syrup
then
you
have
got
to
try
this
beer
and
really
no
better
place
for
a
brewer
to
make
a
maple
beer
than
vermont
after
a
vigorous
pour
this
beer
had
a
2
mm
head
which
faded
to
lace
there
was
a
floating
solid
peace
of
something
in
the
glass
that
i
couldnt
identify
but
it
made
me
excited
first
taste
this
beer
screams
maple
syrup
even
down
the
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
it
is
smooth
and
ohhh
so
tasty
as
you
continue
to
drink
the
maple
falls
to
the
background
but
the
smoothness
stays
with
you
overall
a
delicious
and
uniquely
vermont
experience
its
pretty
basic
but
still
very
tasty
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
opleasant
enough
but
really
lacks
a
kick
of
spices
or
maple
that
would
make
this
much
more
enjoyable
o
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
lot
more
maple
presence
to
this
beer
especially
with
it
being
called
maple
nipple
it
was
an
interesting
and
fairly
unique
beer
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
for
this
big
a
beer
o
i
love
lawsons
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
best
offerings
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
though
i
like
the
flavors
here
but
i
wish
they
were
more
robust
or
maybe
overpowered
by
sweetness
which
isnt
to
say
its
not
enjoyable
i
liked
it
i
did
not
love
it
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
especially
if
you
have
an
infinitely
to
maple
syrup
and
hey
hes
in
the
middle
of
maple
syrup
country
so
why
not
do
it
up
o
this
was
a
decent
offering
from
lawsons
which
is
very
good
but
definitely
a
little
bit
toned
down
on
the
maple
syrup
compared
to
his
other
offerings
the
maple
syrup
still
adds
a
nice
sweetness
which
in
my
opinion
goes
well
with
the
beer
while
this
wasnt
anything
mindblowing
and
definitely
not
one
of
lawsons
best
offerings
i
still
definitely
enjoyed
this
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
underrated
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
i
recommend
checking
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
d
sweet
cloying
a
big
beer
indeed
if
you
like
sweet
maple
syrup
i
highly
recommend
more
of
a
holiday
brew
for
me
but
since
this
was
consumed
so
close
to
christmas
i
cant
say
i
mind
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
maple
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
maple
doesnt
really
come
out
all
that
much
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
heady
topper
stemless
snifter
a
clearish
maple
brown
color
appropriately
with
a
finger
or
so
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
wispy
layer
leaving
some
shortlived
lacing
on
the
glass
woody
aroma
bready
with
hints
of
maple
ive
learned
from
homebrewing
that
maple
is
an
extremely
difficult
sugar
to
work
with
and
after
the
yeast
noms
it
up
its
hard
to
get
any
maple
aroma
or
flavor
remnants
so
all
things
considered
the
maple
in
the
nose
was
adequate
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
woody
bready
malts
caramel
maple
was
more
subtle
at
first
but
came
out
more
as
the
palate
adjusted
moderate
earthy
hops
and
a
decent
booze
kick
for
a
dry
finish
medium
body
tasty
very
good
overall
just
dont
go
in
expecting
to
get
a
pure
glass
of
gooey
sweet
maple
syrup
booze
maple
adds
a
nice
touch
to
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
play
as
nearly
as
strong
a
role
as
it
does
in
some
of
lawsons
other
maple
beers
faystons
stout
biscuity
and
toffee
malt
flavors
pair
well
with
it
a
bit
of
a
full
bodied
feel
to
it
makes
for
a
nice
drink
on
a
cool
fall
evening
the
maple
syrup
is
a
nice
sweetening
agent
but
if
i
tried
this
blindfolded
i
wouldnt
even
know
there
was
maple
in
it
however
the
sweetness
is
smooth
and
as
i
said
not
cloying
at
all
a
very
nice
balance
not
often
attained
the
result
is
just
a
nice
slightly
sweet
dark
ale
with
a
nice
carbonation
fit
for
a
cool
fall
evening
is
it
overpriced
many
would
say
yes
im
glad
i
bought
it
but
moneywise
when
it
comes
down
to
this
or
three
cans
of
heady
well
you
know
overall
i
wanted
this
to
be
spectacular
but
it
was
just
alright
oh
well
still
not
bad
o
nothing
offensive
or
repulsive
just
boring
bland
and
uninteresting
hv
skål
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
nearly
full
feel
it
boasts
a
light
level
of
carbonation
but
is
easy
drinking
it
is
my
understanding
that
maple
sugar
is
highly
fermentable
that
didnt
seem
to
be
the
case
with
this
beer
if
it
was
a
little
more
attenuated
i
couldnt
have
easily
drank
more
but
asis
it
lends
itself
as
a
very
sweet
desert
offering
d
i
must
say
that
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
maple
nipple
this
is
one
nipple
of
which
i
was
quick
to
be
weaned
off
medium
bronze
colpr
light
offwhite
head
decent
lace
aroma
was
sport
of
metallicastringent
and
mapley
taste
was
maple
and
bopze
some
oak
and
odd
astringency
feel
was
medium
creamy
nicely
carbonated
drink
was
average
nothing
special
rashly
nice
to
at
least
try
though
one
of
the
strangest
beers
ive
tasted
in
a
while
not
what
i
expected
much
more
subtle
which
is
a
bit
of
a
lost
art
good
beer
im
growing
fonder
of
lawsons
with
each
bottle
we
pop
d
kind
of
hard
to
drink
as
its
too
sweet
and
not
really
all
that
good
ill
pass
on
this
pass
on
this
d
that
brassymetallic
flavor
dominates
after
each
sip
and
is
really
a
turnoff
to
the
point
it
was
a
struggle
to
finish
to
the
point
also
i
dont
really
want
this
again
unless
much
more
sweet
maple
can
be
ensured
disappointing
but
maybe
because
my
hopes
were
so
high
drinkability
is
nice
sort
of
an
odd
but
interesting
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
completely
to
my
taste
but
it
was
neat
none
the
less
d
i
was
fairly
impressed
by
this
one
not
going
to
end
up
being
one
of
my
favorites
but
for
a
maple
flavored
beer
this
does
a
surprisingly
good
job
of
not
being
too
overpoweringly
sweet
and
syrupy
thanks
again
for
yet
another
great
brew
from
lawsons
finest
michael
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
only
coming
through
now
and
then
in
the
finish
but
it
adds
a
nice
heat
to
it
it
certainly
does
creep
up
on
you
and
i
saw
this
bottle
disappear
dangerously
quickly
however
besides
the
maple
and
hops
this
beer
does
sort
of
drag
on
near
the
end
but
while
it
lasts
it
is
pretty
unique
and
tasty
a
beer
called
maple
nipple
from
vermont
needs
to
be
a
maple
extravaganza
this
isnt
bad
but
could
be
so
much
more
d
an
interesting
idea
and
well
done
but
still
not
very
drinkable
enjoyable
in
very
small
quantities
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
unique
brew
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
halffinger
of
white
head
a
moderate
amount
of
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
a
thin
collar
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
some
slight
maple
character
very
faint
indeed
there
is
a
bit
of
sweet
grain
and
some
brown
sugar
there
as
well
the
taste
is
slight
molasses
and
brown
sugar
in
addition
to
a
bit
of
maple
character
medium
body
with
pretty
good
carbonation
not
my
favorite
lawsons
beer
though
glad
i
got
to
pick
this
bottle
up
beer
has
an
almost
nutty
quality
to
it
lots
of
maple
lots
of
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
in
the
front
half
the
beer
overall
is
medium
in
body
and
has
low
carbonation
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
but
not
overly
so
interesting
its
a
good
beer
for
the
ingredients
a
little
too
hot
but
overall
a
decent
beer
wow
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
that
slowly
worked
its
magic
on
me
and
a
buddy
as
we
got
through
two
bottles
of
this
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
have
to
get
and
this
completely
worked
for
me
i
loved
how
the
molasses
worked
with
the
bright
citric
fruit
notes
and
that
big
but
approachable
body
makes
for
some
fantastic
sipping
during
those
cold
late
fall
nights
this
beer
just
screamed
vermont
to
me
i
nominate
this
as
the
official
state
beer
d
a
decent
spiced
beer
but
something
in
the
taste
was
a
little
weird
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
smell
but
not
the
taste
as
much
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
would
give
another
try
if
i
came
across
it
cheers
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
really
like
the
maple
syrup
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
feels
like
one
or
two
things
are
just
a
bit
off
i
think
if
lawsons
were
to
tweak
the
recipe
a
little
bit
they
could
have
an
a
range
maple
beer
on
their
hands
still
enjoyed
the
bottle
i
had
though
and
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
maple
tripple
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
beer
glad
i
could
try
it
1290
this
tastes
unique
definitely
a
lot
of
maple
syrup
character
sweet
but
not
overthetop
with
a
sort
of
sticky
mouthfeel
as
well
that
defines
it
more
or
less
really
no
counterplay
from
malts
just
clean
pale
malts
i
suppose
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
but
the
burn
comes
through
in
the
upper
digestive
system
making
it
a
sipper
rich
and
delicious
a
good
night
cap
of
a
beer
palate
is
also
dominated
by
cardboard
really
oxidized
and
stale
with
a
bit
of
maple
behind
it
a
little
toasted
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
finish
and
an
odd
medicinal
flavor
the
body
is
thin
this
is
pretty
bad
not
great
overall
definitely
a
bit
off
i
wonder
if
this
is
how
it
always
is
or
if
something
happened
to
this
bottle
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
very
good
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
and
i
will
seek
out
other
lawsons
in
the
hopes
that
this
beer
is
an
anomaly
but
i
dont
ever
think
that
this
beer
will
grace
my
lips
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
touch
of
warmth
but
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
not
really
any
maple
character
but
a
pretty
unique
beer
thanks
alex

offering
well
crafted
delicious
understated
yet
bold
mild
yet
heady
at
9
well
worth
seeking
out
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
one
drinks
a
lot
like
an
american
barleywine
with
an
added
dimension
of
having
maple
i
love
maple
so
thats
a
good
thing
i
shared
this
bottle
with
three
other
friends
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
maple
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
too
long
and
leaves
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
with
just
a
bit
of
maple
to
the
aroma
holy
rich
maple
the
taste
is
toasty
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
really
big
maple
finish
the
maple
is
bold
and
rich
and
finishes
pretty
nicely
i
think
the
maple
isnt
too
overpowering
and
balanced
pretty
well
with
the
toasty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
maple
makes
it
slightly
sticky
its
still
nice
and
the
carbonation
is
well
done
for
a
nine
percent
beer
this
drinks
pretty
well
especially
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
up
front
this
tastes
like
a
decent
brown
ale
but
the
maple
comes
through
perfectly
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
pleasant
sipper
for
a
fall
afternoon
i
shared
this
bottle
with
a
friend
and
was
itching
to
crack
the
other
but
it
was
saved
for
another
day
not
sure
if
sean
lawson
considers
this
his
flagship
beer
but
it
should
be
this
is
damn
fine
drinking
well
done
apparently
you
can
only
purchase
this
beer
by
the
bottle
at
a
small
store
in
warren
vt
they
receive
small
shipments
and
never
know
which
type
they
will
get
each
friday
there
is
a
4
bottle
per
person
per
day
limit
i
was
able
to
get
my
4
bottle
around
4pm
on
saturday
afternoon
shortly
before
they
sold
out
the
beer
pours
into
the
glass
to
reveal
a
nice
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
last
a
while
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
maple
roasted
malt
and
light
apple
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
mildly
silky
there
was
a
slight
buttery
feel
on
the
lips
as
the
beer
was
tasted
the
first
taste
is
mild
maple
with
roasted
caramel
followed
my
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
i
am
more
of
a
dipa
fan
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
it
would
be
almost
perfect
update
the
second
pour
from
the
bottle
i
include
some
floating
yeast
which
gives
a
more
pronounced
fresh
bread
and
maple
feel
mr
lawson
doesnt
lie
as
this
is
both
smooth
and
powerful
with
the
alcohol
approaching
as
it
warms
medium
carbonation
a
nice
sweet
and
spicy
libation
on
an
early
autumn
evening
this
bomber
was
brought
back
from
vt
for
me
by
joshman
thanks
dude
rare
batch
135
bottle
32
poured
into
stemmed
glasses
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
odd
color
the
best
way
to
describe
it
would
be
a
dark
neon
rust
color
a
different
shade
of
color
that
i
have
ever
seen
before
nice
thick
bubbly
head
with
some
good
lacing
smell
was
semisweet
a
bit
like
a
rich
caramel
taste
was
good
but
interesting
had
a
nice
maltiness
to
it
but
on
the
sweet
side
i
did
not
get
the
maple
flavor
but
i
think
that
it
was
added
merely
as
a
way
to
sweeten
the
beer
and
not
necessarily
as
a
flavor
component
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thick
side
which
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
made
with
syrup
drinkability
was
fairly
good
as
it
was
a
great
tasting
beer
and
the
high
abv
was
well
hidden
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
a
beer
from
this
regional
brewer
and
this
was
a
nice
intro
flavor
is
interesting
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
very
sharp
and
boozy
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
i
expected
also
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
anticipated
due
to
the
description
regardless
not
bad
at
all
just
different
lots
of
strong
ale
resemblances
slight
hops
yeast
and
again
more
booze
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
decent
but
not
a
lawsons
offering
id
seek
out
again
looking
forward
to
the
beers
made
with
actual
maplebourbon
barrels
pours
a
cloudy
light
apple
cider
amber
color
with
a
big
stiff
off
white
head
that
resists
fading
and
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
belgian
lacing
behind
i
really
like
the
smell
its
crazy
sweet
maple
syrup
and
pumpkin
or
something
very
slight
spice
thing
happening
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
velvety
smooth
and
mediumfull
bodied
im
starting
to
feel
a
little
heat
very
little
not
distracting
in
anyway
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
maple
syrup
seriously
get
the
pancakes
out
love
it
i
guess
youve
really
got
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
because
i
dont
understand
the
scores
that
its
getting
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
point
me
the
way
to
lawsons
mmm
nipples
p
s
is
this
really
a
fruit
beer
unless
i
am
failing
at
life
again
and
do
not
understand
the
definition
of
fruit
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
maple
sweetness
the
flavors
were
wild
sour
apples
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
sweet
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
with
some
subtle
spices
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
a
nice
little
sweetness
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
o
get
it
its
worth
it
now
in
a
6pk
and
with
a
new
body
profile
o
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
so
this
fit
into
my
wheelhouse
nicely
i
also
dig
the
christmas
flavors
that
this
is
packed
with
nice
solid
brown
spiced
ale
here
not
for
everyone
but
good
by
me
any
day
o
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
overly
sweet
and
spiced
pours
dark
amberbrown
with
a
ruby
hue
in
the
light
and
small
head
smells
like
plums
raisins
sour
cherry
cinnamon
ginger
nutmeg
spices
are
subdued
in
the
aroma
and
it
is
more
fruit
than
anything
else
spices
dominate
flavor
though
with
a
cinnamon
plum
nutmeg
combo
medium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
smooth
finishes
slightly
dirty
about
what
i
expected
a
bit
bland
and
not
something
i
will
have
again
just
cant
get
into
the
studf
with
cinnamonnutmeg
overpowering
the
flavor
they
did
what
they
wanted
here
but
i
would
have
preferred
a
seeeter
brew
with
lots
of
fruit
o
a
rich
and
tasty
holiday
brown
ale
with
a
distinctive
pallet
of
spices
has
great
complexity
and
flavor
dynamics
a
bit
sweet
and
approaches
overspiced
but
then
this
is
a
winter
holiday
ale
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
spiced
beers
cigar
city
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
spices
a
mistake
that
has
befallen
other
brewers
hazy
chestnut
brown
pour
with
reddishpurple
hues
topped
with
a
small
but
dense
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thick
ringlet
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
and
nutty
full
of
ripe
fruit
and
light
spice
taste
of
fresh
fruitcake
candied
plums
and
apricots
sweet
bready
malts
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
lots
of
sweet
elements
yet
overall
the
beer
was
not
cloying
or
sickeningly
sweet
there
was
a
good
balance
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
but
fullerand
much
tastierthan
your
average
brown
ale
liked
this
one
a
lot
and
picked
up
a
bottle
to
take
home
not
bad
i
just
feel
the
same
meh
for
most
christmas
ales
overall
interesting
beer
thanks
for
the
extra
mike
and
im
always
happy
to
try
a
ccb
offering
im
generally
a
fan
of
fruit
or
sourness
but
i
did
enjoy
tasting
this
unique
take
on
a
christmas
themed
brown
ale
overall
very
easy
to
drink
full
of
flavor
fairly
complex
definitly
better
than
your
average
brown
ale
ginger
and
spice
in
aroma
a
cigar
puff
in
the
finish
xmasy
brown
ale
obtained
through
a
mail
order
overall
this
isnt
a
particularly
good
beer
by
any
means
the
bitter
herbal
notes
in
the
finish
didnt
go
very
well
with
the
other
flavors
i
wouldnt
have
another
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
least
favs
from
my
favorite
brewery
similar
to
their
maduro
but
a
little
sweeter
o
perfect
cocktail
beer
which
is
what
i
did
meant
to
be
shared
a
good
novelty
from
ccb
a
good
beer
to
share
overall
an
enjoyable
winter
ale
that
avoids
the
pitfall
of
all
spiceno
beer
o
a
nice
holiday
beer
with
lots
of
spiced
flavors
going
on
not
quite
balanced
could
use
more
of
a
malt
backbone
o
different
interesting
not
a
huge
fan
overall
but
its
not
bad
i
love
cigar
city
and
the
beer
they
brew
but
this
one
just
misses
too
wrongly
spiced
and
oddly
bitter
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
not
a
fan
overall
a
secent
winter
ale
my
buddy
and
his
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
dont
know
if
ill
pick
this
up
again
but
definitely
worth
trying
cheers
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
but
its
just
a
style
of
beer
that
i
havent
found
to
put
out
something
great
yet
worth
trying
particularly
if
you
like
beers
of
this
style
d
pretty
drinkable
pretty
similar
to
the
2011
anchor
our
special
ale
poured
a
mostly
brown
amber
with
an
average
sized
tan
head
the
nose
is
mild
notes
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
with
some
more
subtle
dark
fruit
under
tones
smooth
mouth
feel
with
a
medium
body
and
some
carbonation
flavor
is
spicy
with
loads
more
cinnamon
and
ginger
notes
some
lesser
chocolate
notes
are
present
as
is
the
mellow
nutty
malt
back
bone
some
dryness
on
the
finish
with
an
aftertaste
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
a
great
holiday
brew
i
like
the
warmer
winter
a
little
better
but
this
is
a
good
one
o
very
tasty
brew
that
i
want
to
revisit
and
try
one
aged
overall
very
good
beer
overall
was
not
expecting
much
from
the
negative
reviews
i
was
getting
from
friends
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
overall
very
good
beer
overall
another
fine
offering
from
cigar
city
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
find
it
on
draft
pours
a
hazy
dark
garnet
color
with
two
fingers
of
dense
cream
colored
foam
settles
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
a
few
lines
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
spice
bouquet
for
reals
ground
ginger
and
cinnamon
and
some
floral
notes
base
is
toast
almond
with
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
taste
black
plum
and
brown
sugar
are
buried
under
orange
ginger
and
powdery
cinnamon
toasted
nutty
finish
creamy
feel
but
with
maybe
a
little
too
aggressive
carbonation
for
a
laid
back
holiday
beer
nuts
and
spices
work
together
yep
bottled
nov

2011
d
i
like
this
a
lot
but
i
think
a
little
more
residual
sugars
would
really
benefit
the
beer
i
could
see
a
little
bit
of
caramel
120
or
special
b
malt
here
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
but
it
comes
across
a
little
too
austere
to
be
great
or
too
make
me
want
to
purchase
again
o
not
a
bad
little
winter
ale
thanks
for
sending
this
one
doctorb2b
it
pours
a
deep
dark
red
with
a
thin
foam
head
the
beer
smells
like
winter
spices
tasting
the
beer
is
no
different
from
the
smell
there
is
incredible
winter
spices
that
mix
with
a
sweet
brown
ale
body
this
is
definitely
a
cookie
in
a
bottle
and
it
doesis
nice
job
with
balance
this
beer
is
quite
seasonal
and
tasty
but
just
too
damn
hard
to
get
ahold
of
o
this
has
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
go
these
in
an
evening
overall
i
think
it
is
a
really
nice
and
interesting
beer
the
only
thing
is
i
wish
the
dark
fruit
flavors
made
more
of
an
impact
in
the
flavor
i
would
love
a
bigger
plum
presence
like
i
was
expecting
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
though
and
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
out
awesome
christmas
in
a
bottle
o
i
looked
at
the
menu
and
read
the
words
sugar
plum
and
though
to
myself
oh
boy
here
comes
a
sticky
cloying
dessert
im
happy
i
was
wrong
in
the
aftertaste
i
get
a
leafy
tobacco
feeling
that
is
a
bit
off
i
still
really
enjoy
it
who
would
have
thought
that
i
would
like
tobacco
in
a
beer
guess
im
moving
up
in
the
world
had
a
bottle
on
new
years
eve
that
id
brought
back
from
a
trip
to
florida
earlier
in
december
i
could
not
have
been
more
disappointed
in
it
its
utterly
lacking
in
body
like
a
bud
light
hit
up
with
all
the
spices
in
the
world
more
than
anything
it
just
doesnt
taste
finished
its
possible
that
with
another
several
months
in
bottle
it
would
improve
if
it
was
bottle
conditioned
i
cant
remember
the
way
premature
home
brew
does
but
i
wouldnt
count
on
it
o
not
a
beer
id
drink
again
8
per
750ml
bottle
is
such
a
waste
when
you
can
get
far
better
beers
for
that
this
was
really
disappointing
since
it
was
the
first
disagreeable
beer
i
had
from
cigar
city
this
beer
really
needs
you
to
take
your
time
with
it
especially
if
on
first
sip
it
doesnt
seem
all
that
welcoming
sitting
in
the
glass
and
warming
does
a
world
of
good
to
open
up
the
flavors
o
overall
sugar
plum
is
a
solid
holiday
ale
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
brown
ale
part
is
pretty
much
lost
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
standout
winter
beers
ive
had
it
epitomizes
a
holiday
spice
feel
really
not
a
huge
fan
of
spices
in
beer
for
the
most
part
but
this
ends
up
tasting
like
a
nice
spiced
cake
when
all
is
said
and
done
overall
the
spice
blend
is
quite
nice
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
up
the
malt
a
little
bit
increase
the
body
and
kill
that
weird
bitter
acrid
finish
even
with
some
interesting
flavor
those
are
too
many
improvements
to
warrant
a
really
good
score
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
bodied
and
just
a
little
bit
prickly
this
one
drinks
easily
especially
considering
the
slog
some
spiced
brews
can
be
harpoon
winter
warmer
take
note
this
is
how
you
do
a
heavily
spiced
winter
seasonal
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
going
into
this
one
but
it
turns
out
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
highly
recommended
o
way
too
many
spices
used
for
a
6
english
brown
base
a
higher
octane
brown
or
more
subtle
spicing
would
vastly
improve
this
beer
this
one
is
on
the
verge
of
cloying
and
quite
a
disappointment
overall
a
nice
holiday
sipper
one
and
done
a
bit
too
cloying
and
spicy
one
of
the
few
times
i
have
not
been
impressed
with
cigar
city
o
i
like
it
a
bit
better
than
most
who
have
reviewed
it
but
it
is
way
down
the
list
of
the
maduro
treatments
it
is
interesting
and
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
the
750
cheers
o
unfortunately
this
was
disappointing
i
think
the
base
brown
ale
didnt
have
enough
substance
behind
it
to
support
the
additions
they
tried
to
pull
off
it
was
a
confusing
bland
beer
and
i
dont
think
id
try
again
though
it
was
interesting
to
have
once
i
applaud
the
concept
as
soon
as
i
heard
about
this
beer
being
brewed
and
bottled
i
had
to
try
it
and
im
not
disappointed
it
really
is
one
of
the
better
spiced
brown
ales
although
i
havent
come
across
an
abundance
of
them
nice
offering
certainly
one
worth
trying
when
priced
right
overy
unique
beer
not
what
i
expected
more
of
a
spiced
beer
than
a
fruit
beer
the
750ml
will
go
down
but
i
wont
be
tempted
to
buy
this
again
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
harsh
peppery
spices
that
overwhelm
the
palate
and
overtake
all
of
the
other
flavors
tons
of
ginger
cinnamon
pepper
and
other
spices
kill
the
dark
fruit
and
toasted
malt
notes
that
are
hard
to
pick
up
this
beer
is
a
mess
with
just
too
much
going
on
at
once
im
glad
that
i
split
it
with
a
bunch
of
friends
because
i
had
trouble
finishing
a
few
ounces
dont
shy
from
cigar
city
beers
though
they
have
a
lot
to
offer
o
a
heavily
spiced
seasonal
brew
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
another
quality
brew
from
ccb
beer
a
fair
amount
of
spice
nutmeg
maybe
some
cinnamon
lot
of
bitterness
from
hops
and
i
get
this
slight
pit
bitterness
to
it
as
well
the
nose
is
pretty
good
but
in
the
end
this
combination
of
spice
and
flavors
was
a
little
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
a
sweet
tasty
sugar
plum
but
this
didnt
quite
deliver
o
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
hoping
and
it
was
decent
i
feel
like
they
overhopped
this
beer
and
killed
it
bc
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
if
it
was
sweeter
and
maybe
more
belgian
style
realy
nice
beer
creamy
to
start
with
a
cleaner
than
expected
finish
somewhat
drying
as
well
mediumbodied
with
a
solid
effervescence
i
could
drink
this
seasonal
brew
all
year
round
the
spices
are
wellrestrained
in
the
mouth
slight
coating
on
the
palate
overall
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
good
for
what
it
has
become
i
wish
the
smell
was
better
than
it
is
and
wish
the
taste
of
spices
were
translated
better
into
the
beer
leaves
more
to
be
desired

nice

d
i
could

several
i
have
the
feeling
cigar
city
will
be
known
for
the
big
beers
they
make
but
this
is
one
of
the
examples
of
a
wonderful
sessionable
brew
that
they
will
bring
to
market

solid

warmer
12

poured
into
a
pint
glass
really
didnt
have
any
taste
okay
beer
one
is
all
i
need
easy
drink
a
little
sweet
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
surprising
for
me
because
im
not
normally
a
fatheads
fan
ginger
and
allspice
dominate
both
aroma
and
flavor
cola
notes
become
evident
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
great
label
good
xmas
spirit
just
about
a
carbon
copy
of
great
lakes
christmas
ale
guess
i
gotta
write
a
review
cuz
its
not
letting
me
do
a
quick
score
my
buddy
brought
this
down
from
his
hometown
in
ohio
back
here
to
texas
nice
treat
looks
solid
very
clear
no
head
nose
isnt
too
pungent
nose
and
flavor
are
the
same
except
the
flavor
has
more
malt
flavor
holiday
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
vanilla
medium
body
mellow
carbo
solid
brew
very
similar
to
the
classic
great
lakes
christmas
ale
at
10
99
a
sixer
this
will
definitely
be
added
to
my
annual
christmas
lineup
o
fantastic
probably
in
my
top
three
christmas
ales
will
definitely
be
purchasing
more
o
very
good
spiced
christmas
ale
that
tastes
that
is
heavy
on
the
spices
of
the
season
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
great
lakes
christmas
ale
in
my
opinion
with
holly
jolly
being
just
a
little
more
malt
forward
o
i
feel
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
christmas
ale
very
spice
heavy
not
quite
warming
enough
for
me
though
id
go
winter
warmer
over
herbspice
ale
next
time
taste
mixes
malt
flavors
with
the
spices
better
than
the
nose
would
indicate
still
quite
cookieesque
though
the
honey
comes
forth
in
this
beer
more
so
than
any
other
beer
i
have
had
maybe
even
as
much
as
dfh
midas
touch
the
ginger
seems
to
help
that
perception
as
does
the
rich
malt
mouthfeel
is
great
full
and
silky
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
i
could
see
it
being
too
rich
for
more
than
one
or
two

a
sitting

a

a
bit
of
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
overall
7

oas
it

it

the
spice
is
still
there
but
nothing

a

not
worth

for

look

overall
this
is
a
nice
spiced
ale
and
a
good
holiday
brew
the
spices
were
not
overwhelming
like
in
some
renditions
of
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
as
to
be
expected
from
this
brewery
overall
decent
session
christmas
beer
though
glc
still
rules
the
roost
a
toast
of
this
beer
to
steve
who
introduced
himself
at
the
king
of
the
hill
ipa
tasting
at
incline
public
house
he
needed
a
sitdown
and
i
was
happy
to
share
my
table
joined
by
his
brother
frank
and
sisterinlaw
leanne
i
was
about
to
leave
but
they
bought
me
one
so
thanks
for
that
meeting
new
friends
over
good
beer
is
always
a
keeper
in
the
holiday
memories
department
great
to
meet
you
guys
cheers
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
ive
tried
its
spicy
without
being
overwhelming
piney
without
being
too
pungent
and
has
a
deep
satiny
body
that
goes
down
easily
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
this
beer
is
what
i
had
hoped
st
2xmas
would
be
like
the
aromas
are
similar
but
fh
presents
a
much
smoother
and
more
palatable
flavor
in
my
opinion
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
active
carbonation
and
theres
a
pretty
sticky
finish
that
you
can
feel
for
a
good
30
seconds
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
christmas
ale
not
the
best
style
on
earth
but
this
gets
the
job
done
when
youre
looking
for
something
to
warm
you
up
or
looking
for
something
that
fits
in
during
the
season
six
packs
released
with
a
deep
mahogany
brown
crimson
hue
with
light
khaki
tan
head
forming
nicely
in
intricate
patterns
down
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aroma
has
spices
for
christmas
ginger
cinnamon
etc
with
a
definite
honey
tone
fermented
out
a
bit
strong
spice
character
throughout
each
sip
its
super
spicy
limiting
the
enjoyment
of
each
sip
to
how
high
your
tolerance
is
to
the
honey
cinnamon
ginger
dry
spice
additions
are
mouthfeel
gets
cloying
at
times
be
ready
to
share
this
beer
with
those
folks
who
love
great
lakes
christmas
ale
hell
rim
the
glass
with
a
mix
of
cinnamon
and
sugar
if
you
have
to
overall
i
love
fatheads
this
beer
is
off
my
palates
radar
for
beers
i
truly
love
but
i
consider
it
to
be
a
good
solid
christmas
ale
dark
amber
pour
with
decent
head
and
retention
aroma
is
light
nutmeg
ginger
and
cinnamon
primarily
nutmeg
taste
is
sweet
with
cinnamon
up
front
and
the
other
spices
following
honey
is
in
there
somewhere
i
like
this
as
a
holiday
ale
but
am
not
overwhelmed
by
it
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
i
know
it
is
july
but
it
has
held
up
quite
well
holly
jolly
is
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
from
fat
heads
brewery
here
in
ohio
its
not
a
threat
to
dethrone
great
lakes
christmas
ale
but
its
a
nice
supplement
to
the
christmas
season
if
the
strong
sprucey
piney
flavor
could
be
toned
down
a
little
itd
be
even
better
easy
recommendation
nevertheless
last
year
i
went
overboard
buying
christmas
beers
and
got
tired
of
them
really
fast
this
year
i
only
bought
one
a
sixer
of
this
one
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
not
because
i
dont
like
it
i
simply
prefer
great
lakes
christmas
ale
its
a
little
sweeter
than
this
one
and
feels
a
bit
more
festive
somehow
perhaps
its
the
label
on
the
bottle
pours
a
lightly
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
spice
and
quite
faint
in
the
taste
spices
especially
all
spice
but
mellow
in
the
end
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
nice
spice
but
mellow
and
faint
o
excellent
winter
spiced
ale
very
flavorful
and
balanced
happy
holidays
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
different
style
of
xmas
ale
its
a
brown
ale
with
some
winter
warmer
notes
the
sugars
and
spices
arent
overpowering
at
all
hops
are
minor
fruits
are
mixed
in
with
added
sugars
ginger
makes
up
the
main
flavor
with
the
buttery
malts
good
not
great
worth
a
drink
the
body
is
moderate
the
carbonation
borders
on
high
but
is
kept
in
check
generally
its
pretty
smooth
definitely
plenty
crisp
but
not
biting
alcohol
doesnt
factor
too
much
in
the
feel
which
is
good
great
nose
and
pleasant
flavor
an
accomplished
winter
warmer
or
apparently
a
spiced
beer
a
wellbalanced
holiday
spiced
winter
brew
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
same
beerrecipe
as
their
christmas
ale
of
years
past
seems
very
similar

was
not

with

one
tasted
like
corona
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
not
of
this
one
taste
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
bl
limearita
also
has
an
odd
smell
that
accompanies
the
beer
swing
and
a
miss
on
this
one
i
bought
this
on
grand
opening
day
from
a
big
box
wine
chain
store
some
earthy
fruit
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
mustiness
and
a
shot
of
skunk
pours
hazy
murky
straw
under
a
offwhite
foam
cap
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thick
film
i
try
to
swirl
off
the
skunk
but
it
still
interferes
with
the
big
fruity
flavors
over
white
wonder
bread
that
lead
to
a
tart
finish
and
a
suspicion
of
wet
cardboard
well
carbonated
with
a
very
creamy
medium
body
my
rating
gives
this
beer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
assuming
that
some
of
the
flaws
in
my
bottle
derived
from
mishandling
my

great
stuff
im
sure
id
get
tired
of
it
after
awhile
but
for
this
quick
taste
it
has
been
exceptional
now
i
will
finish
it
while
making
lunch
dinner
a
fairly
tasty
wellmade
wheat
beer
fullflavoured
and
not
too
sweet
i
guess
the
agave
adjunct
is
more
about
helping
the
body
out
or
something
if
i
recall
the
breckenridge
episode
i
just
watched
on
repeat
for
the
past
4
days
at
gabf
perfectly
good
wheat
beer
this
is
an
interesting
flavor
to
put
into
a
wheat
beer
im
not
a
big
wheat
guy
but
i
liked
the
attempt
to
do
something
different
nice
change
from
the
typical
wheats
but
not
one
that
made
me
like
the
style
any
more
pleasant
slightly
citrusy
taste
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
it
goes
down
very
easily
dis
favorite
beer
5
out
of
5
overall
decent
flavors
but
odd
mixture
and
execution
12
ounce

a
friend
gave
this
to
me
recently
and
i
have
no
idea
how
freshold
this
is
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
apples
and
honeyagave
nectar
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
bready
malt
and
apricots
noticeable
too
its
mostly
sweet
tasting
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
an
ok
brew
but
it
really
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
with
that
being
said
its
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
decent
fruit
beer
out
of
breckenridge
could
be
an
interesting
switchup
for
orange
juice
during
breakfast
o
the
light
thin
beer
has
an
odd
tang
to
it
that
might
be
agave
flavor
but
it
is
a
bit
too
soft
to
tell
there
are
some
wheat
hint
s
but
not
much
o
i
was
craving
something
light
after
a
long
day
of
work
this
hit
the
spot
kind
of
its
decent
but
wheat
beers
arent
really
my
thing
altogether
not
bad
but
just
a
little
too

a
good

if
you
like

then
the
price
point
is
good
we
were
sitting
in
the

in

as
further
proof
that
the
canquest

can
take

anywhere
at

the

revealed

another
brimful
craft
can
before
i
could
initiate
the

the
old

looked
over
and
exclaimed
oooh
ive
never
had
it
in
the
can
roflmao
not
wanting
to
waste
another
second
i
got
the
glug
going
and
then
really
gave
it
to
her
color
was
an
extremely
cloudy
goldenyellow
near
pineapple

with
a
turbidity
like

nose
had
a
soft
mandarin
orange
scent
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
nice
orangish
flavor
in
the
mouth
finish
was
semisweet
still
orangish
and
really
much
better
than
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
either
in
a
bottle
or
ondraft
score
one
for
the
cans
it
seems
that
everyone
is
drinking
breckenridge
vanilla
porter
this
summer
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
their
agave
wheat
beer
and
i
had
to
try
it
theres
the
wheat
and
broad
sweetness
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
full
of
the
wheat
with
the
touch
of
agave
which
doesnt
add
much
in
terms
of
flavor
but
does
seem
to
provide
an
unbalanced
sweetness
which
seems
to
be
the
main
problem
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
relatively
dry
with
moderate
thickness
and
a
sticky
aftertaste
overall
it
doesnt
offer
much
and
again
its
too
sweet
and
too
sticky
for
me
to
drink
in
a
session
and
not
interesting
enough
to
seek
out
again
overall
not
a
total
flop
but
not
going
to
drink
it
again
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
highly
sessionable
ale
the
agave
goes
over
really
well
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
underrated
but
i
understand
why
as
it
is
different
and
feels
a
little
weird
for
a
beer
tastewise
personally
i
think
this
agaveflavored
style
has
a
future
and
id
like
to
see
more
of
it
i
could
see
agave
ales
becoming
a
class
of
their
own
it
has
a
good
malty
sweet
characteristic
that
isnt
cloying
and
pairs
well
with
biscuity
malts
while
keeping
a
beer
light
and
sessionable
give
it
a
try
theres
no
wow
factotrhere
but
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
mostly
dull
and
boring
im
sure
more
could
be
done
to
enhance
the
agaveness
or
why
bother
having
it
in
there
at
all
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
nothing
world
class
going
on
but
as
far
as
agave
beers
go
this
is
probably
the
best
one
ive
had
breckinridge
agave

served
on

not

some

but
i
have
had
more
from
lemonade

tea
not
a

just
not
all

memorable
overall
this
was

agave
wheat
is
one
of
the
few
wheat
beers
that
you
come
across
that
does
not
have
a
sweet
fruit
overpowering
the
wheat
and
ale
characteristics
of
the
beer
however
the
agave
sugars
does
bring
a
little
something
extra
to
the
table
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
unfiltered
but
it
still
pours
up
nearly
crystal
clear
with
a
one
and
half
finger
white
lacing
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
smell
is
sort
of
bready
maybe
wheat
even
rye
taste
is
sort
of
spicy
sweet
apples
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
just
okay
but
this
one
would
be
very
sessionable
due
to
low
abv
and
easy
drinkability
i
tried
this
beer
in
comparison
to
wolavers
organic
wildflower
wheat
and
was
quite
disappointed
a
good
unfiltered
wheat
but
i
got
no
hint
of
agave
flavoring
drinkable
yet
unremarkable
smell
was
very
wheaty
and
there
is
a
hint
of
lemon
rind
which
can
be
found
in
the
taste
however
it
is
missing
a
sharp
acidic
sweetness
that
would
have
really
rounded
it
out
in
my
opinion
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
to
jump
up
and
take
notice
of
i
would
have
preferred
a
stronger
wheat
beer
with
a
more
robust
wheat
flavor
to
compliment
the
agave
character
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
odinteresting
enough
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
no
really
my
cut
o
meat
though
poured
into
a
frosty
mug
cloudy

a
fine

i
have
a
cold
do

unknown
nice
micro
brew
bite
with
a
typically
wonderful
wheat
beer
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
need
to
add
more
content
so
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
bitty
blah
there
was
an
old
lady
she
lived
in
a
shoe
man
her
house
smelled
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
which
i
am
drinking
just
to
try
pours
very
hazy
orange
with
a
one
finger
of
a
white
head
this
wheat
beer
has
notes
of
lemon
grass
onion
and
wheat
of
course
a
light
dark
fruit
flavors
not
too
earthy
or
spicy
more
sweet
and
sugary
then
anything
not
too
bitter
or
dry
a
slight
smooth
feel
easy
drinking
a
very
average
wheat
beer
this
beer
is
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
give
it
try
if
you
havent
had
it
solid
win
for
breckenridge
d
nothing
special
the
agave
adds
some
light
floral
and
honey
touches
to
the
flavor
profile
that
make
it
slightly
more
interesting
than
an
average
american
wheat
beer
but
thats
not
saying
much
drinkable
but
unremarkable
overall
a
fairly
typical
unoffensive
hefe
that
tries
to
be
unique
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
again
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
pretty
good
definitely
not
a
combination
you
see
too
often
worth
trying
but
its
not
going
to
make
my
short
list
o
very
refreshing
and
slightly
sweet
take
on
wheat
beer
little
more
sweet
than
most
wheat
beers
ive
had
worth
looking
for
another
good
brew
from
breckenridge
ive
never
been
particular
about
things
like
appearance
and
smell
but
thats
not
to
say
theres
anything
wrong
with
it
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
notable
however
i
basically
dont
care
for
wheat
ales
unless
they
are
loaded
with
fruit
flavors
or
in
some
other
way
augmented
this
is
not
that
unless
youre
a
wheat
beer
fan
or
just
really
want
a
wheat
ale
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
reach
for
this
one
agave
might
be
to
vague
to
pick
out
but
it
does
add
an
underlying
layer
that
you
know
is
foreign
to
beer
not
as
drinkable
as
i
expected
but
worth
a
try
3
0
d
mediocre
brew
that
has
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
second
beer
i
tried
from
them
which
sounded
so
very
good
but
nowhere
near
lived
up
to
expectations
poured
a
1
offwhite
head
of
average
life
the
body
is
a
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
not
much
smell
even
warmed
not
much
taste
beyond
an
average
bmc
the
agave
at
most
adds
a
mild
hint
of
sweetness
but
otherwise
all
i
get
is
very
lightly
toasted
malt
no
finish
to
speak
of
and
the
website
says
this
is
an
herbedspiced
beer
really
i
didnt
know
agave
was
an
herb
or
a
spice
its
just
another
sweetener
really
its
a
fair
beer
tastes
pretty
good
though
it
isnt
going
to
blow
anybody
away
its
combination
of
sweetness
and
wheat
beer
will
at
least
make
it
different
in
a
way
a
soso
pale
wheat
ale
with
a
nice
signature
if
you
like
these
sort
of
brews
youll
probably
get
into
this
one
they
call
it
an
herbedspiced
beer
and
for
that
it
really
doesnt
showcase
the
agave
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
it
doesnt
stand
out
that
much
from
pale
wheat
ales
ive
had
whos
to
argue
styles
its
decent
o
not
a
bad
ale
but
i
was
expecting
more
wheat
andor
agave
presence
seems
to
be
a
touch
of
both
and
mildly
presented
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
a
definite
warm
weather
beer
and
not
much
beyond
that
from
my
perspective
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
on
a
nice
warm
day
it
will
likely
hit
the
spot
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
wheat
beer
that
i
enjoyed
would
be
a
perfect
beer
when
you
want
something
lighter
with
more
flavor
than
the
typical
macro
lager
pours
light
yellow
with
not
much
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
the
wheat
with
some
sweet
notes
to
compliment
the
flavor
is
subtle
but
enjoyable
a
wheat
start
with
the
sweet
notes
following
with
a
very
mellow
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
not
much
depth
of
flavor
but
had
enough
to
make
this
beer
enjoyable
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
great
for
sipping
on
a
hot
day
o
a
very
interesting
beer
must
try
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
a
wheat
beer
the
flavors
were
pretty
bland
and
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
agave
that
was
advertised
which
was
a
big
let
down
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
crisp
but
that
flavors
couldnt
hold
my
attention
at
all
one
is
enough
i
want
something
that
delivers
what
they
advertise
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
they
were
both
a
little
better
then
average
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
bland
flavors
and
the
fact
that
the
agave
didnt
show
up
in
the
aroma
and
taste
at
all
and
that
should
have
been
showcased
in
this
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
an
oberon
i
dont
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
its
a
waste
of
agave
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
breckenridge
and
it
was
another
unimpressive
and
average
at
best
beer
just
like
their
lucky
u
ipa
i
am
still
down
to
try
another
beer
from
them
but
it
better
be
a
good
one
if
they
want
to
hold
my
interest
so
far
im
not
impressed
with
them
overall
drinkable
but
much
is
left
to
be
desired
many
in
this
genre
over
fruit
the
beers
whereas
this
one
doesnt
have
a
distinct
enough
fruit
presence
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
this
bottle
was
given
as
a
sample
from
a
distributor
to
be
honest
an
entire
6pack
might
get
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
i
could
possibly
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
o
id
just
finished
walking
7
miles
in
the
sun
when
i
stopped
and
had
this
ontap
i
liked
the
different
flavor
and
feel
maybe
i
was
particularly
thirsty
but
i
had
a
second
one
with
my
sandwich
the
low
abv
was
nice
as
i
was
able
to
continue
walking
another
5
miles
to
my
destination
it
was
just
the
thing
for
me
today
o
sorry
for
the
short
review
but
i
could
not
find
anything
stellar
in
this
beer
except
for
the
brief
creamy
banana
presence
i
could
see
this
being
popular
for
someone
transitioning
into
craft
beer
o
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
unique
twist
on
a
wheat
beer
which
im
a
huge
fan
of
however
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
all
around
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
having
on
draft
in
az
a
color
light
golden
yellow
s
nose
almost
none
really
sticking
nose
in
glass
to
try
to
get
anything
but
to
no
avail
t
taste
toasted
wheat
bread
sans
butter
a
little
salt
light
creamy
lingering
finish
o
basic
unimpressive
pass
next
a
nice
slightly
sweet
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
sure
i
would
hunt
it
out
on
my
next
trip
to
the
beer
store
d
it
worked
pretty
well
as
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
its
not
special
there
are
much
better
wheat
beer
to
be
had
a
sessionable
beer
even
from
a
tulip
glass
but
probably
better
suited
to
a
frat
party
while
easy
to
consume
i
find
no
reason
to
try
this
or
any
other
agave
beers
for
that
matter
ov
very
cool
take
on
a
wheat
beer
spicy
and
peppery
without
being
overpowering
this
beer
wasnt
too
much
to
rave
over
but
the
originality
of
this
brew
and
natural
taste
make
it
worth
buying
especially
for
a
summer
ale
o
i
wavered
between
a
2
5
and
3
for
an
overall
it
definitely
had
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
wheat
but
it
was
only
average
when
it
came
to
taste
this
beer
is
worth
trying
but
it
not
an
exceptional
beer
would
pair
well
with
a
beef
or
chicken
burger
or
after
a
few
dull
beers
not
a
beer
to
start
off
with
pours
a
thick
cloudy
yellow
color
into
a
frosty
pint
glass
with
a
2
inch
white
head
smells
yeasty
and
is
very
visibly
unfiltered
also
some
bitter
hops
in
there
and
wheat
malts
flavor
is
refreshing
mildly
fruity
and
you
can
definitely
taste
agave
which
by
itself
is
a
rather
difficult
to
describe
mildly
sweet
lush
plant
feel
is
too
thick
for
this
beer
too
full
bodied
to
be
a
good
summer
beer
but
good
carbonation
keeps
it
fairly
easy
drinking
my
pour
was
perhaps
toward
the
bottom
of
the
keg
because
it
was
much
thicker
and
more
cloudy
than
the
bottles
of
this
that
ive
had
either
way
a
creative
take
on
a
wheat
beer
just
not
my
favorite
breckenridge
product
not
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
a
bit
watery
and
thin
lacks
body
and
is
slightly
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
hints
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
on
the
finish
decent
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
minimal
lacing
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
for
this
one
wont
buy
again
i
can
see
this
being
popular
with
people
being
introduced
to
craft
beers
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
notes
a
good
beer
start
to
finish
and
very
drinkable
cheers
not
bad
but
you
can
do
better
perfect
for
someone
whos
never
had
the
style
though
so
good
marks
for
that
doverall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
didnt
have
the
complexity
i
was
looking
for
but
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
i
prob
wont
be
seeking
it
out
bc
i
think
there
are
other
beers
that
are
similar
that
i
like
way
more
but
overall
i
was
pleased
to
try
it
overall
i
like
this
take
on
the
wheat
beer
how
many
agave
wheat
beers
are
out
there
the
low
abv
is
great
for
sessioning
this
anytime
of
year
in
my
opinion
this
is
not
my
favourite
breckenridge
beer
by
any
means
but
it
most
definitely
is
my
favourite
wheat
beer
overall
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
it
was
nice
to
try
something
different
with
the
agave
i
like
it
a
lot
this
beer
has
a
fresh
zing
and
is
wet
enough
to
be
thirst
quenching
this
yeast
flavour
is
more
like
a
light
lager
than
a
heffeweizen
this
might
be
a
suitable
lawn
mowing
beer
o
a
drinkable
wheat
some
smoothness
that
i
did
not
expect
from
wheat
went
looking
for
something
unique
with
the
agave
found
a
smooth
wheat
a
decent
wheat
beer
the
agave
add
to
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
some
very
interesting
flavor
transitions
very
refreshing
an
aftertaste
that
leaves
you
craving
more
i
really
like
this
beer
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
in
the
world
but
it
has
some
unique
characteristics
that
you
wont
come
by
too
often
o
ok
light
and
drinkable
but
not
nothing
spectacular
particularly
for
style
this
beer
actually
has
a
pretty
body
to
it
with
some
depth
that
while
light
doesnt
feel
remotely
thin
its
not
heavy
but
it
has
a
full
creaminess
to
it
yet
still
has
a
crispness
and
unlike
so
many
of
its
like
is
actually
genuinely
refreshing
the
finish
is
very
quick
but
its
a
good
feel
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
head
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
but
nothing
too
exciting
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
its
got
a
nice
minimal
fruitiness
to
it
balanced
with
the
wheat
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
isnt
too
strong
with
the
agave
its
very
subtle
and
tastes
pretty
refreshing
regardless
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
much
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
overall
this
brew
isnt
too
bad
i
think
its
worth
trying
but
probably
wont
knock
your
socks
off
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
hazy
creamy
peach
color
with
a
thin
stable
head
nose
is
mostly
wheat
slight
notes
of
fruit
like
pear
and
white
grape
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
wheat
and
fruity
notes
dominating
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
no
real
noticable
flavor
from
the
agave
however
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
i
had
anticipated
with
a
thin
yet
creamy
carbonation
overall
a
good
wheat
beer
nothing
really
special
if
youre
looking
for
the
agave
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
solid
beer
if
youve
got
an
mgddrinking
friend
that
youd
like
to
introduce
to
real
beer
this
is
a
nice
first
step
for
them
to
take
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
perfect
pint
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
since
the
name
has
two
of
my
favorite
things
in
it
agave
and
wheat
unfortunately
neither
shine
with
this
boring
flop
im
deducting
points
from
the
overall
score
for
getting
my
hopes
up
o
not
bad
but
doesnt
show
any
agave
characteristics
as
its
name
would
imply
which
is
disappointing
drinkable
because
it
is
light
and
clean
good
carbonation
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
75
just
an
okay
beer
there
are
much
better
wheats
out
there
appearance
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
short
white
head
the
nose
on
agave
wheat
has
grass
wheat
and
some
citrus
its
taste
contained
flavors
from
lemon
wheat
malt
fairly
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
while
there
is
an
acidic
quality
to
it
o
not
too
shabby
not
the
greatest
not
the
worse
a
decent
brew
that
i
may
come
back
to
another
time
but
not
one
that
would
be
a
regular
favorite
the
agave
at
least
gives
it
some
character
but
there
isnt
much
flavor
here
its
pretty
tame
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
run
out
to
get
got
a
6pack
on
sale
for
7
99
this
is
normally
9
49
which
it
is
not
worth
that
price
not
even
8
imo
still
a
decent
drink
good
in
the
summer
heat
d
well
it
has
good
marketing
the
rest
of
it
is
sort
of
plain
and
run
of
the
mill
it
is
solid
and
good
but
a
bit
underwhelming
if
you
are
really
expecting
something
just
looking
for
easy
drinking
spot
on
after
all
it
is
a
summer
release
you
arent
going
to
be
sipping
and
contemplating
this
whilst
sitting
before
a
cozy
fire
overall
reminds
me
of
something
on
the
lines
of
a
magic
hat
9
sweeter
characteristics
brought
forth
from
what
i
assume
are
the
agave
notes
combined
with
the
heightened
quality
of
the
malts
makes
this
one
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
wheat
beer
thats
unique
but
doesnt
go
out
of
its
way
to
be
different
its
not
a
novelty
beer
it
fills
a
niche
between
the
lines
of
where
one
craves
a
hefeweizen
a
summer
wit
or
a
plain
unfiltered
wheat
big
on
flavor
but
its
subtle
flavor
refreshing
and
a
harmless
4
2
abv
i
always
try
to
have
a
pint
when
i
find
this
on
tap
as
for
the
alcohol
i
almost
didnt
think
this
was
beer
since
this
was
so
mellow
and
easygoing
while
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
this
will
please
just
about
anybody
and
would
be
a
decent
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
a
something
more
than
a
massmarket
offering
is
called
for
some
more
flavor
would
have
been
great
here
as
this
beer
had
enough
body
to
it
to
cut
whatever
would
have
stood
out
instead
this
proved
the
adage
about
beer
being
liquid
bread
to
be
true
since
i
felt
somewhat
full
after
downing
my
bottle
had
this
on
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
and
poured
it
on
a
hefeweizen
glass
this
beer
showed
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
onefinger
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
almost
no
carbonation
was
observed
in
the
behavior
of
the
body
some
lacing
present
it
was
very
hard
to
define
the
smell
for
this
beer
because
it
was
very
low
but
i
was
able
to
gather
hints
of
wheat
and
grass
taste
also
had
hints
of
grassy
flavors
and
wheat
present
along
with
a
bready
touch
and
a
very
small
spicy
feel
and
aftertaste
poured
a
cloudy
orangetinted
yellow
noticeably
carbonated
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
typical
wheaty
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
and
resin
typical
wheat
profile
on
the
taste
buds
a
bit
acidic
citrusy
with
agave
as
a
subtle
sidekick
left
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
too
bad
light
body
and
generally
drinkable
though
not
really
enough
for
me
to
want
more
overall
this
was
a
pretty
boring
beer
i
really
didnt
pick
up
on
the
agave
nectar
all
that
much
it
tasted
like
a
basic
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
this
stuff
has
always
been
interesting
but
not
enough
for
me
to
buy
any
thankfully
there
are
tastings
at
bliss
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
fake
blueberry
think
pretty
much
any
blueberry
wheat
ale
available
on
the
market
dark
wheat
light
orange
rind
and
a
dash
of
nutmeg
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
coriander
white
grapes
lightly
tart
and
only
just
barely
that
nutmeg
and
grapefruit
peel
a
vague
astringency
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
i
cannot
say
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
agave
nectar
doesnt
do
much
for
it
and
it
comes
off
as
astringent
and
medicinal
regardless
luckily
things
arent
exactly
offensive
either
just
not
very
good
summary
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
try
honestly
i
know
what
agave
is
but
have
never
tried
it
in
anything
beside
tequila
maybe
i
will
after
this
nice
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
brew
i
really
like
the
other
breckenridge
beers
ive
had
and
was
hoping
i
had
found
a
good
afternoon
type
beer
that
is
readily
available
in
my
area
alas
i
probably
wont
get
this
one
again
the
label
is
cool
but
i
can
collect
other
cool
labels
that
cover
better
beers
o
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
nice
and
refreshing
if
it
were
readily
available
here
in
maine
i
think
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
during
the
summer
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
one
i
recommend
it
pours
light
yellow
with
not
much
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
the
wheat
with
some
sweet
notes
to
compliment
the
flavor
is
subtle
but
enjoyable
a
wheat
start
with
the
sweet
notes
following
with
a
very
mellow
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
not
much
depth
of
flavor
but
had
enough
to
make
this
beer
enjoyable
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
great
for
sipping
on
a
hot
day
it
is
light
bodied
and
there
is
a
certain
crispness
present
that
makes
it
really
drinkable
carbonation
level
is
just
right
definitely
interesting
although
id
say
a
bit
of
a
novelty
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
it
again
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
d
an
interesting
ingredient
doesnt
always
make
for
an
interesting
beer
not
completely
terrible
but
not
something
that
i
would
recommend
or
seek
out
again
overall
not
impressed
at
all
some
wheat
flavors
there
but
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
mass
produced
off
flavor
and
the
mouth
is
just
weird
and
unpleasant
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
possibly
from
the
agave
the
flavor
is
pretty
nice
i
get
some
nice
sweet
notes
from
the
agave
and
also
get
some
fruity
notes
that
closely
resemble
grapes
there
is
also
some
nice
wheat
and
grain
notes
in
the
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
pours
like
an
unfiltered
cloudy
wheat
beer
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
stays
throughout
some
highpitched
grasscitrus
in
the
smell
dept
taste
immediately
starts
off
with
some
tartness
from
the
agave
then
dries
out
with
it
as
well
lemon
a
bit
of
apple
fruity
and
refreshing
to
be
honest
not
much
in
the
way
of
the
wheat
but
its
probably
there
more
to
keep
the
body
balanced
than
for
flavor
an
interesting
beer
i
enjoy
tequila
so
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
now
again
o
not
sure
id
drink
a
sixer
of
this
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
a
nice
beer
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
random
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
and
some
fruitiness
from
the
agave
i
would
imagine
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
a
pretty
good
fruity
taste
coming
through
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
i
am
not
too
sure
i
would
drink
this
one
very
often

it
has
a

note
its
pretty
light
bodied

and
pretty
smooth
the
finish
is
a

a

it
tastes
pretty
solid
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
lemony

flavor
that
gets
twangy
at
the
end
of
the
taste
its
pretty
spicy
with
a
note
of

there
is
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
that
seems
kind
of
herbal
for
lack
of
a

the

i
really
dont
know
what

tastes
like

i
couldnt

it

this

a

the

is
more

but
some
ample
carbonation
helps
it
match
the
taste
better
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
fairly
unique
american
wheat
that
i
recommend
very
fresh
tasting
and
refreshing
thirstquenching
and
easily
sessionable
on
a
hot

afternoon
somebody
called
the
flavor
honey
and
aloe
and
i
think
that
sums
it
up
well
im
a
big
fan
of
unusual
flavors
in
beer
but
it
still
does
not
offer
a
completely
unique

experience
this
is
a

that
matches

ive
had
a
couple
hibiscus
beers
before
and
thought
i
would
like
this
one
i
thought
incorrectly
its
ok
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
verdict
a
very
interesting
beer
from
revolution
a
very
nice
presentation
of
hibiscus
but
there
is
little
else
in
terms
of
complexity
or
interest
that
being
said
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
quite
the
thirst
quencher
a
crushable
summer
beer
that
breaks
for
the
norm
of
lighter
pale
ales
session
ales
and
lagers
i
often
find
myself
wondering
why
i
dont
pick
this
up
more
often
in
the
summer
months
a
very
worth
while
brew
overall
pretty
good
really
tastes
like
a
fruit
beer
very
herbal
flowery
influenced
light
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
a
nice
example
for
the
style
worth
a
drink
for
sure
oa
solid
summer
beer
the
flowers
add
a
pleasant
taste
one
of
the
first
beers
brewed
outside
of
belgium
that
pour
a
magenta
hue
with
a
pink
tinged
head
these
rosa
hibiscus
beers
dont
pull
any
punches
fine
speckled
lacing
left
intricately
adds
to
the
beauty
of
the
beer
aroma
has
notes
of
a
citrus
based
wheat
with
floral
notes
galore
so
flowery
in
the
aromatics
that
it
really
rises
up
to
the
rosa
namesake
a
nice
base
beer
maybe
some
wheat
in
the
malt
bill
slightly
citric
tartness
bitterness
derived
from
the
hibiscus
hops
added
color
seems
natural
not
dyed
like
most
unique
colored
beers
out
there
this
proves
that
revolution
doesnt
really
make
any
bad
beer
its
that
good
other
than
the
hibiscus
im
guessing
theres
some
citrus
peel
and
dried
spices
added
to
the
mix
but
i
cant
really
pick
them
out
amongst
the
heavier
floral
forward
notes
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
dryness
not
overtly
sweet
earthy
floral
notes
galore
with
even
carbonation
for
the
style
a
bit
dead
on
and
not
aggressive
in
anyway
id
call
it
lighter
bodied
overall
impressive
canned
offering
from
an
innovative
brewer
i
bet
they
sell
a
ton
of
this
even
if
its
not
the
most
unique
beer
ive
ever
tasted
out
of
these
floral
aka
rose
hips
infused
beer
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
version
of
a
difficult
style
to
make
balanced
o
a
very
nice
and
interesting
herbspiced
beer
which
is
very
well
executed
i
enjoy
both
rose
and
hibiscus
so
this
one
hits
the
mark
for
me
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
but
it
is
not
a
session
beer
as
i
felt
content
after
one
pours
a
hazy
light
red
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
grain
fruit
and
hibiscus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
grain
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
light
and
refreshing
its
slightly
acidic
finish
is
welcome
as
any
hop
contributions
are
scant
careful
not
to
oppose
the
herb
still
the
balance
trends
thinly
sweet
fruity
flowery
and
semidry
resembling
rose
wine
early
and
often
this
tepidly
headed
ale
may
be
an
ideal
crossover
beer
for
fans
of
zinfindale
overall
a
very
enjoyable
unique
offering
from
revolution
the
spiced
tones
are
subtle
and
merely
an
accessory
so
dont
let
that
scare
you
off
creamy
and
sugary
flavors
are
well
received
this
is
a
winner
the
hibiscus
adds
a
gorgeous
ruby
hue
that
imparts
a
pinkish
head
which
is
quite
fluffy
with
great
retention
extreme
floral
notes
trick
your
nose
into
believing
its
in
a
flower
shop
the
hibiscus
is
very
prominent
but
lets
subtle
notes
of
white
peppercorn
honeydew
biscuit
and
honeyed
malt
show
their
presence
a
honeylike
sweetness
makes
up
the
backbone
on
the
palate
delicate
floral
notes
of
rose
petal
and
of
course
hibiscus
pleasantly
grace
and
compliment
the
honey
sweetness
despite
the
fragileness
of
the
floral
notes
the
body
is
quite
strong
yet
super
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
there
were
ever
a
perfect
lawnmower
beer
this
would
be
it
some
people
may
find
rosa
too
sweet
but
i
like
her
how
she
is
the
malt
bill
is
what
really
throws
this
beer
off
nothing
off
the
top
of
my
head
comes
to
mind
as
a
good
sub
for
it
but
the
complexity
and
excellent
blend
of
spiced
flavors
helps
make
up
for
it
the
rosa
hibiscus
ale
from
revolution
is
ok
the
beer
poured
a
amber
with
purple
tinge
there
was
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
scent
had
a
spice
to
it
that
reminded
me
of
raisons
maybe
the
taste
was
slightly
dry
with
mild
spice
to
it
and
had
a
slight
citrus
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
was
good
but
not
one
that
i
would
consider
a
go
to
o
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
some
other
reviewers
perhaps
its
because
it
is
the
first
beer
after
15
miles
of
hiking
on
a
sunny
summer
day
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
not
remarkable
but
today
it
hit
the
spot
revolution
rosa
hibiscus
ale
3
55
o
wasnt
crazy
over
this
one
it
was
fairly
refreshing
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
tea
like
beer
but
unless
you
like
tea
you
probably
wont
like
this
overall
not
a
bad
drink
fairly
refreshing
if
not
just
a
little
odd
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
some
pork
with
some
fruit
chutney
dont
know
that
id
necessarily
drink
it
myself
again
but
could
be
a
nice
summer
offering
for
those
not
fond
of
hops
or
those
with
a
predilection
towards
fruitier
alcoholic
drinks
uh
oh
a
unnatural
looking
pink
brew
red
flags
up
on
appearance
for
me
served
in
a
funny
jointed
pint
glass
at
the
brewery
with
a
very
small
off
white
head
of
thin
bubbles
it
smells
tart
fruity
tart
not
yeasty
tart
and
absolutely
floral
perhaps
one
step
below
perfume
type
it
smells
fresh
and
interesting
but
i
cant
pick
out
much
grain
yeast
or
hops
which
always
makes
me
suspect
of
a
brew
the
first
sip
is
very
different
quite
acidic
thin
front
of
tongue
zesty
and
just
loaded
to
the
gills
with
the
hibiscus
flower
essence
which
if
i
was
unfamiliar
with
before
i
sure
am
not
anymore
the
finish
is
quick
and
dry
without
much
sweetness
but
again
very
little
yeast
grains
or
hops
somewhat
more
like
a
fruit
drink
i
give
points
here
for
creativity
and
for
innovation
but
this
isnt
a
beer
thats
anywhere
near
my
wheelhouse
the
flowers
were
too
dominant
for
me
this
could
use
some
refining
o
there
really
isnt
much
going
on
with
brew
but
it
does
drink
exceptionally
well
to
be
honest
very
refreshing
for
these
dog
days
of
summer
an
interesting
experiment
but
never
need
to
drink
it
again
o
nice
flowery
flavors
thats
easily
drinkable
wouldnt
be
my
go
to
choice
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
its
a
nice
option
if
nothing
else
is
around
overall
surprisingly
enjoyable
fruity
notes
were
nice
and
its
refreshing
o
this
will
be
a
perfect
beer
for
summertime
wouldnt
mind
to
pick
a
sixpack
in
the
future
o
a
nice
summer
beer
somewhat
akin
to
a
berliner
weisse
a
sour
mashlactic
fermentation
would
really
push
this
into
awesomeness
overall
very
disappointing
especially
for
revolution
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
i
think
it
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
instead
of
a
rainy
night
inside
really
interesting
overall
taste
was
pretty
good
and
light
in
comparison
to
the
smell
defiantly
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
recently
o
this
beer
looks
smells
and
feels
like
a
great
fruit
beer
but
the
lack
of
overall
flavor
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
well
as
the
lack
of
actual
hibiscus
flavor
or
aroma
leaves
me
wishing
for
something
more
it
is
a
beer
with
great
potential
that
has
yet
to
be
reached
weird
beer
very
bland
to
me
its
nothing
more
than
something
to
keep
you
refreshed
the
feel
is
as
light
as
id
expect
but
gives
some
depth
the
body
actually
leans
toward
medium
though
it
still
rests
in
lightbodied
territory
crispness
doesnt
disappoint
on
either
the
light
or
heavy
end
pretty
effervescent
but
not
overly
so
and
its
pretty
smooth
as
well
for
the
love
of
god
though
spare
yourself
i
was
excited
over
tasting
a
new
beer
steeped
with
habiscus
and
very
dissappointed
in
the
actual
beer
itself
i
will
not
buy
again
sorry
i
was
expecting
a
stronger
habiscus
influence
that
was
not
present
in
this
beer
i
truly
believe
that
a
habiscus
steeped
beer
can
be
made
a
bit
better
with
a
greater
proportion
of
habiscus
ratio
in
order
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
when
you
are
mowing
the
lawn
or
doing
some
grilling
o
a
light
summer
beer
with
a
semirare
ingredient
that
doesnt
do
much
for
me
definitely
nothing
i
would
order
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
for
its
uniqueness
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
unusual
and
yummy
a
good
beer
nothing
remarkable
or
memorable
but
a
good
beer
pink
peer
is
certainly
interesting
beer
was
just
okay
lacked
much
flavor
at
all
and
the
only
flavor
it
did
have
was
all
floral
no
hops
or
anything
else
to
remind
you
hey
this
is
beer
another
one
of
those
beers
that
sounds
good
on
paper
and
just
doesnt
work
in
practice
it
wasnt
horrible
at
least
it
was
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
o
good
all
around
beer
and
perfect
for
summer
daysnights
o
a
nice
summer
beer
thats
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
something
nice
for
a
changeofpace
but
thats
about
it
a
quaffable
beer
its
nice
for
a
hot
day
but
outside
of
that
i
still
find
it
uninteresting
d
its
a
wellexecuted
herbspice
beer
with
the
adjuncts
integrating
with
instead
of
dominating
the
base
beer
is
the
base
some
sort
of
altbier
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
not
something
id
order
often
as
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
a
whole
mug
the
2011
bachelor
party
extravaganza
moves
south
to
sheffields
the
inaugural
brew
pours
a
clear
pinkruby
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
hibiscus
i
knew
it
was
some
sort
of
sweetsmelling
flower
and
finding
out
which
one
made
my
mind
sleep
slightly
easier
sweet
honey
light
black
cherry
light
red
grape
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
honeydipped
red
apple
dark
cherry
and
that
same
bit
of
caramel
the
hibiscus
comes
back
in
near
the
finish
allowing
for
a
sweet
floral
character
to
break
through
everything
comes
off
as
very
sweet
but
also
kinda
tart
its
a
strange
sensation
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
but
not
one
i
plan
to
revisit
any
time
soon
o
not
a
bad
summer
beer
and
its
light
character
helps
out
on
a
hot
day
lacks
an
overall
polish
for
lack
of
a
better
word
to
bring
all
of
the
components
together
o
this
brew
has
refreshing
qualities
but
not
really
my
favorite
combo
of
flavors
the
food
was
tastier
than
this
beer
but
at
least
they
had
antihero
on
cask
that
is
such
a
great
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
unique
taste
makes
it
hard
to
get
tons
down
fairly
low
spice
tastes
of
cloves
not
bad
at
all
nice
thick
mouthfeel
for
this
low
of
alcohol
beer
overall
a
good
and
quite
interesting
herbal
spiced
saison
complex
yet
well
balanced
i
didnt
love
this
but
am
happy
to
have
had
a
bottle
and
can
easily
see
some
fans
of
farmhouse
ales
loving
it
overall
its
a
solid
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
right
down
the
middle
overall
wow
this
is
another
great
saison
by
stillwater
im
really
really
impressed
with
this
brewer
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
and
could
easily
drink
enough
to
really
get
in
trouble
we
purchase
at
the
wine
source
so
drank
in
bottles
we
gave
an
extra
5
pts
in
look
for
lovely
artwork
on
packaging
floral
and
soft
herbs
with
fruit
and
honey
very
clean
very
well
done
overall
drinks
wonderfully
the
body
and
carbonation
are
a
bit
lacking
but
this
one
is
tough
to
set
down
very
enjoyable
some
nice
funk
a
pear
funk
with
some
good
carbonation
different
than
any
other
beerb
ive
had
kudos
overall
another
one
knocked
out
of
the
park
from
stillwater
a
decent
saison
that
i
actually
really
liked
on
first
sip
in
breaking
it
down
i
find
myself
talking
myself
out
of
liking
it
but
thats
about
the
components
vs
the
whole
the
flavors
that
are
present
are
nice
though
theyre
simple
needs
more
complexity
or
for
those
upfront
characteristics
to
be
better
rjt
way
too
sweet
for
a
saison
in
my
opinion
lots
of
interesting
flavors
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices

i
think
stillwaters
of
love
and
regret
is
a
very
interesting
tasty
beer
thatwhile
it
certainly
has
some
flawswas
a
pleasure
to
try
it
gets
the
earthiness
quotient
right
and
successfully
gets
the
flowerherbal
flavors
to
works
without
being
too
sweet
or
perfumey
a
successful
go
at
an
herbedspiced
saison
o
a
very
tasty
saison
that
is
quite
enjoyable
drinkable
and
refreshing
o
interesting
for
sure
and
quite
the
flavorful
saison
o
everything
works
in
harmony
for
this
beer
with
flavors
yeast
hops
the
creaminess
of
the
wheat
malt
its
beautiful
the
mouth
feel
was
the
disappointment
for
me
it
just
lacked
that
zesty
pop
solid
stillwater
saison
feel
with
a
heaping
bunch
of
added
floral
notes
for
me
it
all
works
out
well
together
and
the
floral
flavors
compliment
the
spicy
base
yeast
this
is
a
very
mysterious
beer
smell
and
taste
have
similarities
but
are
totally
unique
in
the
nose
this
screams
belgian
farmhouse
with
notes
of
brett
and
plenty
of
wheat
malts
but
the
flavor
is
very
fruity
with
lots
of
counteracting
spices
the
wheat
is
almost
non
existent
in
the
flavor
with
the
brett
really
melding
with
the
fruit
a
very
interesting
beer
indeed
a
good
beer
but
would
definitely
limit
to
one
or
two
because
the
flavor
can
become
overpowering
o
a
pretty
interesting
beer
that
is
usually
not
up
my
alley
but
htat
i
enjoyed
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
after
first
whiff
pricey
but
a
good
one
try
brew
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
a
lot
of
complexity
this
bottle
has
some
age
on
it
and
i
wonder
what
it
would
have
been
in
its
youth
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
its
not
a
typical
saisonfarmhouse
ale
the
grassy
hay
flavors
have
been
replaced
by
sweet
fruity
florals
but
the
springsummer
attraction
remains
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
sunny
day
utterly
delicious
o
this
one
doesnt
blow
me
away
however
its
an
easily
drinkable
brew
thats
also
mildly
complex
id
gladly
drink
this
again
appearance
is
golden
brown
to
tan
in
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
and
above
average
lacing
smell
is
sweet
earthy
and
yeasty
taste
is
fantastic
herbaceous
woody
with
a
roasted
barley
up
front
leathery
and
tangy
sweet
all
while
a
honeybrown
sugarbanana
sweetness
shines
through
it
seems
to
be
too
sweet
at
times
but
the
sweetness
yields
to
an
earthyyeasty
spiciness
o
very
interesting
take
on
a
saison
and
quite
unique
in
general
the
spice
flavors
make
for
an
intriguing
twist
on
a
classic
style
i
could
drink
this
everyday
and
be
pretty
damn
happy
another
excellent
farmhouse
brew
from
stillwater
b
flip
top
bottle
pours
a
red
garnet
hue
with
slight
hazing
fluffy
cream
colored
cap
that
settles
to
a
tight
finger
of
foam
on
the
nose
fruity
esters
pop
spicy
belgian
yeast
cardamom
apple
cider
clove
and
a
little
cinnamon
with
slight
sour
barnyard
notes
the
taste
brings
brings
more
of
the
nose
but
a
bit
muddled
and
thin
doesnt
shine
on
the
palate
the
way
the
nose
brings
complexity
i
pick
up
a
little
numbing
szchuan
peppercorn
as
well
interesting
very
nice
until
you
start
to
drink
it
expecting
great
ended
up
being
just
good
and
not
worth
the
price
o
a
great
beer
to
try
if
you
like
herbal
teas
scented
soaps
want
to
step
outside
the
lagerale
framework
over
the
top
in
all
the
right
ways
from
the
750
ml
swing
top
bought
at
bine
and
vine
in
san
diego
for
an
extortionate
17
99
and
then
i
read
the
fine
print
product
of
belgium
the
beer
pours
a
murky
dull
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
slightly
laces
the
nose
presents
big
notes
of
bread
and
herbs
reminiscent
of
lavender
and
white
sage
the
beer
almost
smells
like
a
perfumed
soap
using
the
aforementioned
herbs
for
aromatics
the
taste
is
just
as
potently
herbal
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
pulling
everything
together
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
the
initial
sweetness
of
the
beer
fades
and
finishes
slightly
drier
with
residual
herbs
sitting
on
my
palate
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
im
not
running
back
to
the
store
to
grab
another
bottle
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
stillwater
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
candy
ester
with
light
soapy
notes
with
light
sweet
notes
taste
is
a
pretty
good
mix
between
some
soapy
notes
with
good
candylike
ester
notes
with
light
residual
sugar
and
light
dry
malt
aftertaste
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
good
carbonation
this
particular
bottle
may
be
a
bit
tired
but
very
nice
nonetheless
very
enjoyable
easy
drinker
refreshing
lemonadelike
characteristics
without
being
overly
fruity
although
there
are
definite
fruit
notes
some
flowery
aroma
and
floral
flavor
nice
hops
flavor
almost
ipa
like
maybe
a
little
too
carbonated
but
would
drink
again
deep
bronze
color
on
the
pour
very
bubbly
white
head
some
nice
lacing
very
much
alive
with
the
carbonation
not
quite
fizzy
but
close
nice
hit
of
acid
on
the
back
o
overall
spicy
herbal
and
lightly
candied
sweet
with
a
shadow
of
fruit
tentatively
recommended
poured
into
ommegang
tulip
with
a
very
large

that
develops
to
very
nice
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
smell
is
of
fresh
grass
very
floral
earthy
some
hop
spiciness
taste
is
very
nice
a
wonderful
spring
saison
with
the
herbs
well
balanced
great
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
hit
the
style
quite
well
overall
another
delicious
offering
from
stillwater
o
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
flowery
herbal
components
that
are
well
balanced
the
brewer
achieved
the
goal
of
a
beer
that
captures
the
impression
of
spring
its
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
dark
for
a
saison
but
as
a
specialty
it
works
i
probably
would
have
purchased
this
beer
if
i
know
what
i
was
getting
into
with
a
beer
brewed
with
heather
chamomile
lavender
and
dandelion
i
really
should
brew
up
a
beer
with
some
heather
in
it
one
of
these
days
mouth
feel
is
medium
carbonated
didnt
notice
much
alcohol
i
dont
know
this
one
is
a
little
out
there
for
me
too
minty
actually
upset
about
this
one
paid
14
for
a
beer
that
really
is
not
good
o
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
pretty
much
exploded
something
i
wasnt
prepared
for
its
definitely
an
interesting
earthytype
beer
though
as
i
continued
drinking
it
i
liked
it
less
and
less
perhaps
i
poured
it
a
bit
too
vigorously
and
allowed
too
much
of
the
sediment
to
get
into
my
glass
perhaps
i
picked
up
a
bottle
that
had
gone
bad
i
couldnt
find
a
date
on
it
perhaps
my
palates
not
ready
for
this
one
anyway
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
it
but
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
go
in
the
future
with
nearly
gruitlike
spiciness
the
beer
takes
a
pineheavy
balance
from
nose
to
finish
the
decoration
of
wild
flowers
herbs
and
spice
informs
the
taste
of
pine
in
high
form
im
not
sure
if
the
beer
represents
belgian
spring
but
i
does
take
my
imagination
to
botanical
gardens
in
the
u
s
deep
south
o
a
saison
brewed
on
the
floral
end
of
the
spectrum
poured
this
into
brew
from
stillwater
into
a
wine
glass
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
tone
with
a
couple
fingers
of
an
offwhite
head
looks
quite
nice
excited
to
try
this
of
love
and
regret
smells
of
ginger
lavender
yeast
and
some
citrus
sipping
on
this
and
i
taste
lemon
more
yeast
spices
such
as
that
ginger
a
very
interesting
taste
most
certainly
one
that
is
spiced
and
has
other
characteristics
prevalent
in
quite
a
few
belgian
style
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
very
crisp
and
sharp
overall
a
solid
beer
for
sure
kind
of
expensive
but
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
imo
strange
strange
beer
not
bad
just
not
something
like
id
normally
go
for
there
was
an
odd
spiciness
to
it
and
i
finally
figured
out
what
it
was
towards
the
end
tamarind
this
isnt
something
that
id
like
in
my
beer
or
my
food
for
that
matter
and
i
found
that
it
really
distracted
me
from
the
beer
jd
for
the
second
pour
i
allowed
the
yeast
into
the
glass
and
found
it
had
little
impact
on
the
aroma
and
while
adding
some
fruitiness
it
generally
muted
the
flavors
of
love
and
regret
is
better
if
the
yeast
is
left
in
the
bottle
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
like
the
concept
and
think
the
nose
was
spot
on
taste
was
a
little
less
dialed
in
and
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
o
this
was
most
certainly
a
unique
beer
definitely
more
of
a
herbal
and
spice
forward
drink
than
traditional
hop
and
malt
beers
worth
a
try
and
im
glad
i
did
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
poured
a
hazy
bright
orangeamber
with
a
finger
or
so
of
foamy
white
head
that
retained
well
leaving
some
doily
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
of
pronounced
spice
in
the
nose
bready
yeast
touches
of
fruit
esters
taste
is
definitely
spicedriven
kind
of
exploring
the
whole
spectrum
with
chamomile
the
dominant
factor
yeasty
profile
with
a
medley
of
fruits
and
vegetables
with
notes
of
melon
pear
and
sweet
potato
most
dominant
to
me
a
little
thicker
than
medium
in
the
mouthfeel
with
some
booziness
in
the
finishaftertaste
pretty
solid
beer
could
be
a
ladypleaser
as
my
wife
couldnt
get
enough
of
it
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
spices
herbs
fruit
and
subtle
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
spices
fruit
and
herbs
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
was
a
little
letdown
by
this
one
as
i
went
into
it
expecting
a
nice
and
complex
brew
but
found
it
to
be
very
one
note
with
the
spice
and
herb
character
going
on
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
for
what
it
lacked
in
complexity
it
made
up
for
it
with
the
refreshment
aspect
this
is
a
good
thing
when
you
arent
craving
something
to
challenge
your
palate
worth
trying
to
get
your
take
on
it
but
that
is
about
it
overall
a
unique
beer
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
again

whole
bunch
of
spicy

are
tough
to
place

they

points
fairly
dry

with
a
fairly
pleasant

certainly
an
interesting
brew
that
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
initially
the
spice
is
sever
but
is
integrated
better
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
quite
drinkable
and
fairly
solid
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
yeast
filled
creamy
smooth
texture
it
boasts
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
keeps
things
somewhat
light
in
the
mouth
despite
the
herbal
flavors
and
unhidden
alcohol
inclusion
worth
a
try
but
this
reoccuring
sulfuric
character
i
could
do
without
o
one
of
stillwaters
better
beers
not
as
unique
and
complex
as
southamptons
cuvee
de
fleurs
but
still
has
a
good
combination
of
flower
flavors
and
the
light
body
makes
it
fairly
easy

in
maryland
the
6
i
paid
is
probably
lower
than
many
other
places
and
its
still
a

i
might
pick
this
up
from
time
to
time

i
would
have
said
this
is
a
saison
not
a
herbed
spiced
beer
overall
despite
the
huge
creaminess
i
still
dont
love
the
beer
overall
its
spicing
is
nice
and
subtle
but
its
just
not
a
beer
that
draws
me
in
o
delicate
aroma
and
subtle
flavor
balanced
and
refreshing
decent
brew
another
tasty
and
intricate
beer
from
stillwater
delicate
complex
and
unique
and
they
totally
nailed
that
essence
of
spring
thing
they
were
going
for
my
second
favorite
of
theirs
next
to

with
much
foaming
and
commotion
into
a

i
lost
a

before
i

changes
to

then
finishes
with
floral
notes
a
hint
of
ginger
and
somewhat
dry
an
unusual
flavor
combination
that
almost
doesnt
work
but
the
flavor
progression
kept
me
interested
and
wanting
to
try
it
again
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
i
liked
this
i
have
found
stillwater
beers
to
be
unusual
and
somewhat
challenging
but
usually
very
enjoyable
im
glad
they
make
it
out
west
and
i
will
always
try
anything
new
from
them
o
a
bit
sweet
and
thick
for
a
saison
but
the
spiciness
balancess
the
beer
well
i
enjoyed
this
beer
o
i
find
this
beer
quite
pleasant
full
on
spicy
herbal
earthy
and
dry
paired
with
a
mild
belgian
funk
works
for
me
would
make
a
beautiful
spring
beverage
very
refreshing
now
stillwater
just
has
to
work
on
their
bottles
not
exploding
im
a
bit
torn
i
think
this
is
a
very
interesting
if
offputting
beer
stillwater
is
trying
to
do
something
different
and
i
think
they
could
succeed
if
they
turn
the
carbonation
down
a
notch
really
its
just
the
mouthfeel
that
holds
this
back
i
like
the
complexity
in
the
yeast
held
up
by
a
strong
belgian
pale
backbone
which
knows
how
to
take
a
backseat
to
other
flavors
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
to
see
if
the
feel
is
different
very
interesting
but
for
the
price
and
considering
everything
this
isnt
something
ill
reach
for
much
in
the
future
taste
is
mostly
of
rose
floral
malty
its
not
good
at
all
bitter
in
the
mouth
not
pleasant
at
all
if
i
didnt
pay
9
for
it
and
there
was
a
drain
next
to
me
i
would
have
dumped
it
this
may
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
ever
had
as
the
name
suggests
you
will
regret
it
this
pours
a
cloudy
straw
colored
theres
a
light
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
tastes
reminiscent
of
passionfruit
and
pineapple
a
bit
of
mango
and
an
earthiness
very
fizzy
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
and
a
touch
of
white
tea
earthy
funky
spicy
zesty
its
an
intriguing
brew
with
more
in
store
than
your
typical
saison
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
great
i
am
a
big
fan
of
stillwater
but
this
is
as
big
of
a
disappointment
as
barrelaged
existent
even
though
this
beer
was
a
disappoint
i
am
still
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
and
enjoyed
drinking
it

second

very
nice

glad
to
have
this
in
such
a
small
bottle
format
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
but
much
more
would
have
been
dificult
to
finish
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
overall
this
one
isnt
anything
special
ill
drink
it
but
i
dont
need
more
at
all
bottle
from
rileys
in
madison
heather
chamomile
lavender
dandelion
make
for
a
floral
and
herbal
taste
combination
that
is
interesting
and
different
not
great
taste
but
sippable
and
unique
great
generous
retained
head
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
at
6
for
a
350ml
bottle
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
floral
elements
really
blend
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
some
of
the
other
flavors
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
though
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
bright
orange
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
floral
and
spicy
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
very
unique
herbal
spices
mixed
with
some
floral
hoppy
liveliness
really
a
bright
flavored
brew
for
in
the
warmer
months
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
refreshing
feeling
overall
this
brew
was
quite
nice
in
my
opinion
bottle
shared
at
the

of

series

an
offwhite

flavor
retains
the
heather
the
saltiness
gets
a
little
fishy
some
smoke
comes
through
and
theres
a
fruity
fusely
finish
strange
the
brewers
set
out
to
make
a
saison
reminiscent
of
a
breezy
meadow
but
it
doesnt
really
come
close
like
a
meadow
grassy
and
lightly
spiced
with
hints
of
corriander
and
almost
nutmeg
huge
notes
of
flowers
as
i
reach
in
for
a
whiff
very
floral
and
hints
of
almost
sage
like
smells
bouncing
off
the
glass
really
very
well
done
light
and
airy
and
even
after
a
few
moments
it
really
seemed
to
pull
itself
together
quite
nicely
clean
crisp
light
and
light
grape
skins
hints
of
grass
and
flowers
light
grains
and
a
mellow
and
wonderful
flowery
flavor
that
just
really
set
it
apart
and
left
me
looking
for
sip
after
sip
smooth
elegant
and
very
drinkable
flavor
follows
i
can
certainly
pick
out
a
large
coriander
presence
here
some
nice
vegetal
pepperinessreminds
me
of
certain
species
of
basil
or
asian
cilantro
loads
of
yeasty
phenols
are
present
very
unique
beer
and
tasty
wish
it
came
in
750s
instead
of
12oz
and
in
larger
numbers
edit
i
didnt
know
this
actually
had
flowers
in
it
i
thought
it
was
a
weird
yeast
makes
sense
now
although
score
still
stands
o
im
a
big
fan
of
stillwater
for
my
money
you
cant
find
a
better
saison
possibly
even
beer
than
cellar
door
the
other
offerings
from
brian
are
all
quality
but
hide
in
cellar
doors
shadow
i
like
to
see
other
styles
than
farmhouse
from
stillwater
this
one
is
pretty
good
man
this
beer
was
so
close
to
scoring
a
little
higher
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
out
the
fridgee
poured
with
a
mammoth
billowy
foamy
frothy
fluffy
sudsy
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
settled
down
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
apricot
with
lots
of
very
active
bubble
trails
and
trub
bits
floating
around
aroma
is
like
their
description
herbal
grassy
plus
yeast
musty
and
a
little
malt
flavors
like
the
nose
with
the
herbs
coming
out
more
a
hefty
bite
from
the
yeast
and
a
serious
tang
from
heavy
carbonation
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
well
i
already
said
finish
is
herbal
with
an
odd
sweetness
that
wasnt
there
before
and
is
fairly
short
pretty
good
saison
but
not
a
session
highly
carbonated
the
beer
forms
a
huge
frothy
head
thats
difficult
to
contain
in
the
piraat
tulip
i
poured
it
into
smells
herby
like
oregano
off
the
bat
fresh
garden
floral
notes
as
well
as
strong
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
just
as
herby
this
seems
like
it
would
be
perfect
with
italian
dinner
a
little
zest
and
citrus
very
dry
slightly
funky
a
very
interesting
brew
i
like
the
flavors
but
can
see
this
being
overpowering
i
wish
i
had
some
food
or
cheese
to
temper
it
down
a
bit
as
the
herbs
can
be
strong
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
as
it
was
just
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
though
im
not
sure
that
will
often
be
the
case
as
you
need
to
be
ready
overall
this
is
my
least
favorite
stillwater
to
date
i
think
the
spiciness
is
too
strong
and
results
in
the
phenolic
character
perhaps
itll
mellow
out
with
some
time
o
the
brassy
wheat
and
stale
spiced
dominate
there
is
a
faint
cinnamon
or
ginger
heat
to
the
spice
but
it
is
a
bit
to
oxidized
to
have
much
character
the
yeast
and
brett
notes
offer
some
nice
character
but
they
are
covered
up
well
i
am
all
in
on
stillwater
now
this
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
its
very
tasty
o
overall
this
looked
and
smelled
great
but
was
sort
of
a
chore
to
drink
id
like
to
revisit
this
on
draft
if
at
all
possible
to
reevaluate
absolutely
amazing
brew
for
people
who
like
heavy
herbs
and
spice
elements
in
their
brew
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
its
too
expensive
for
me
to
go
back
and
get
another
worth
the
experience
but
i
wouldnt
buy
more
than
one
or
two
if
i
were
you
you
can
get
similar
brews
for
a
cheaper
price
o
this
is
definitely
a
unique
saison
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
try
again
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
expected
with
a
heavy
dose
of
tight
carbonation
up
front
as
well
as
a
very
earthyfloral
flavor
its
also
heavily
spiced
with
zesty
pepper
and
clove
this
is
countered
by
a
sweet
estery
yeast
presence
with
hints
of
citrus
and
crisp
light
fruit
im
picking
up
hints
of
apple
pear
and
banana
as
well
as
some
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
the
floral
notes
compliment
the
fruit
notes
very
well
and
balance
out
the
heavy
carbonation
and
prominent
spice
character
theres
some
slight
alcohol
sweetness
but
overall
the
abv
is
well
masked
resulting
in
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
clear
orangegolden
poured
with
no
head
taste
and
aroma
very
nicely
balance
traits
of
both
saisons
and
tripels
belgian
saison
seems
redundant
but
theres
definitely
a
blending
of
styles
here
fruity
esters
mild
sweetness
clean
lightly
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
nice
highly
drinkable
beer
o
a
very
interesting
beer
which
i
will
probably
not
buy
again
stillwater
offers
so
many
unique
choices
that
are
far
better
than
this
this
is
a
must
have
simply
because
of
its
complexity
you
may
not
want
it
everyday
or
even
every
month
but
it
has
vast
and
complex
merit
even
for
a
complex
style
of
beer
this
stands
out
mouth
is
light
dry
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
finish
leaves
a
lingering
unwanted
soapy
note
theres
just
something
unlovable
about
this
beer
it
misses
the
farmy
notes
of
a
saison
and
includes
flavors
that
just
make
this
beer
unpleasant
dreally
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
definitely
a
departure
from
what
you
would
normally
get
it
was
very
fresh
and
bright
tasting
but
the
aroma
was
a
little
off
putting
i
also
found
the
flavor
to
be
just
a
little
watery
but
overall
it
was
pretty
good
certainly
not
the
best
from
stillwater
but
worth
a
try
this
is
a
seriously
spiced
up
saison
lots
of
lavender
i
think
i
actually
prefer
the
our
side
for
flavor
and
just
need
to
revisit
it
as
it
builds
come
carbonation
interesting
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
finish
is
bone
dry
this
is
easily
the
best
part
of
the
beer
flavor
does
not
linger
on
the
palate
at
all
thank
god
i
was
excited
to
try
stillwater
as
theyve
just
become
available
in
my
area
this
one
was
a
complete
miss
though
ill
give
them
another
shot
for
sure
just
hoping
the
next
is
a
little
more
subtle
flavored
d
good
nice
floral
mix
here
a
little
too
over
the
top
to
session
but
it
was
quite
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
flavor
is
sweet
fruity
spicy
and
herbal
lots
going
on
here
pretty
complex
and
tasty
brew
spicy
cinnamony
notes
in
the
finish
very
light
bitterness
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
oily
texture
and
soft
carbonation
makes
for
quite
a
pleasant
drink
oh
boy
found
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
village
pump
and
grabbed
it
as
soon
as
i
looked
at
it
had
with
some
lamb
dinner
and
the
pairing
was
pretty
great
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
minimal
carbonation
on
the
head
but
you
can
taste
it
even
if
you
cant
see
it
the
smell
is
where
im
first
grabbed
though
you
can
tell
theres
both
something
sweet
and
spicy
in
the
drink
very
pleasant
those
same
notes
are
the
foundation
for
an
amazing
taste
stillwaters
balanced
that
sweetness
alongside
that
spice
for
a
taste
that
develops
really
quickly
in
the
mouth
the
great
thing
about
it
is
that
these
tastes
come
in
a
sequence
not
all
at
once
and
still
better
i
think
i
get
the
spice
first
which
makes
the
whole
sweet
ending
even
better
loved
the
beer
cant
wait
to
find
more
their
import
series
or
other
small
batches
from
them
cheers
its
quite
a
nice
beer
with
an
eloquent
expansive
aroma
followed
by
a
more
subtle
focused
flavor
you
could
quaff
this
beer
but
you
would
miss
all
of
its
beautiful
nuance
superb
d
i
was
able
to
finish
a
33cl
bottle
which
is
a
feat
considering
i
generally
dislike
this
style
of
beer
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
and
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
if
you
live
for
spiced
beers
though
this
one
is
for
you
d
this
was
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
that
could
be
suitable
for
any
season
spicy
taste
is
better
for
cold
months
but
light
body
is
better
for
warm
months
there
was
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
but
the
beer
is
interesting
enough
to
warrant
sipping
and
savoring
too
high
quality
saison
impressive
the
taste
is
very
saisonesq
with
a
nice
a
creamy
finish
more
than
anything
i
get
pineapple
notes
that
really
make
this
an
exceptional
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
no
alcohol
to
really
be
found
other
than
just
a
bit
of
warming
in
the
stomach
and
a
beautifully
put
together
beer
overall
edit
im
not
changing
the
rating
but
as
i
get
to
the
end
of
this
beer
it
seems
more
and
more
of
a
mess
theres
a
meaty
flavor
autolysis
its
a
shame
because
i
like
the
intentions
and
the
overall
flavor
of
this
beer
but
it
seems
as
if
a
lot
of
things
have
gone
wrong
here
d
another
winner
from
stillwater
the
saisons
that
this
joint
is
pumping
out
are
phenomenal
spicy
complex
overpowering
pours
a
cloudy
rusty
orange
color
with
very
little
foam
at
all
there
is
a
little
bit
of
suspended
bits
throughout
the
beer
aroma
seems
to
be
mostly
coriander
pepper
ginger
and
some
sweet
malts
very
dry
mouthfeel
light
bodied
with
slightly
higher
than
wanted
carbonation
the
flavor
is
very
herby
green
peppercorn
decided
to
come
in
and
tag
team
jesus
this
aroma
is
intense
intense
herbal
and
flora
and
spicy
i
cant
tell
you
if
its
absolutely
fantastic
or
the
most
overwhelming
thing
i
have
ever
smelled
mixed
with
alcohol
the
flavor
is
a
massive
blast
of
lavender
like
sucking
on
fresh
flower
petals
its
herbality
is
toned
down
buts

like
i
stated
overall
a
very
unique
saison
this
one
just
tasted
different
than
many
of
the
others
i
have
had
it
brought
a
few
unique
flavors
to
it
fairly
drinkable
d
in
the
end
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
one
note
for
my
liking
a
trap
many
floral
saisons
run
into
a
solid
effort
though
and
certainly
doesnt
diminish
my
interest
in
stillwaters
import
series
d
like
stillwaters
stateside
this
is
infinitely
drinkable
its
interesting
to
drink
this
and
compare
it
to
stateside
saison
to
see
how
one
can
get
different
flavors
in
the
same
style
beer
from
the
same
brewmaster
but
from
different
breweries
and
other
variables
a
nice
collab
between
countries
with
the
ingredients
kinda
blurred
into
a
weird
saison
not
really
feeling
the
taste
or
feel
of
this
one
perhaps
some
months
in
the
cellar
will
shift
some
things
around
but
for
now
naw
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
spicy
again
i
get
some
tea
earthiness
and
a
little
pepper
what
part
is
the
love
and
which
part
is
the
regret
beer
is
quite
creamy
its
almost
like
a
cask
ale
in
a
bottle
very
nice
mouthfeel
taste
is
complicated
its
not
very
bitter
its
mostly
mildly
sweet
up
front
with
this
spiciness
in
the
midpalate
finishes
a
little
dry
but
not
too
much
its
good
a
fun
and
interesting
beer
hazed
lemony
amber
color
with
a
dense
foamy
cream
colored
head
with
long
lasting
retention
and
foamy
clumps
of
lacing
aroma
is
thick
and
pungent
with
earthy
and
zesty
notes
lemon
grass
dandelion
lavender
and
a
surprising
mild
brown
sugar
sweetness
my
expected
reference
point
for
this
beer
was
southamptons
cuvee
de
fleurs
and
well
this
isnt
really
anything
like
that
there
is
a
strong
caramel
malt
and
sweet
yeasty
body
while
each
sip
showcases
a
different
earthy
and
floral
note
throughout
a
slightly
sour
long
lasting
finish
the
spices
and
zest
are
dominated
alternatingly
by
lemon
zest
feint
grassy
hops
dandelion
cardamom
pear
brown
sugar
etc
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
and
over
carbonated
than
desired
for
the
style
and
overall
the
beer
comes
off
a
little
heavier
and
more
filling
than
expected
very
unique
and
enjoyable
however
something
is
slightly
lacking
in
the
balance
for
these
unique
flavors
to
rate
this
higher
regardless
highly
recommended
to
give
this
a
try
if
youre
able
to
find
it
appearance
is
a
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
was
great
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
lime
scents
coming
through
strong
the
taste
was
nice
enough
with
some
of
those
lime
and
orange
flavors
although
it
seemed
more
of
a
zest
in
the
beginning
than
a
major
part
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
refreshing
nice
for
summer
almost
like
a
lime
radler
but
overall
not
as
impressive
as
i
had
hoped
received
this
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
what
a
pleasant
surprise
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
great
drinking
talking
summer
beer
overall
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
with
good
wheat
flavor
presence
and
unique
aromas
from
the
additions
wasnt
a
big
fan
it
sounded
impressive
from
the
description
and
i
was
excited
about
the
citrus
tones
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
summer
beer
and
this
one
in
particular
sounded
good
unfortunately
i
was
disappointed
the
initial
lemonyhoppy
taste
in
great
but
then
theres
this
lingering
herbaly
aftertaste
that
really
bothers
me
it
kinda
plays
a
trick
on
your
mouth
between
a
refreshing
summer
beer
and
a
rugged
ipa
and
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
rugged
ipas
but
in
this
fashion
it
just
doesnt
really
work
anyway
a
little
disappointed
that
i
still
have
2
of
these
in
the
pack
but
overall
the
beer
is
by
no
means
terrible
the
taste
has
a
nice
toasted
biscuit
malt
character
but
unlike
the
aroma
there
is
more
of
a
citruslike
character
kicking
in
this
works
on
a
hot
day
like
today
overall
interesting
summer
offering
if
you
like
lemons
and
weirdness
youll
probably
big
this
not
a
revelation
but
not
a
drainpour
either
hard
to
describe
this
brew
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
hefeweizen
with
a
wedge
of
lemon
and
a
medium
strength
ipa
ok
but
probably
not
a
repeater
draught
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
decent
sized
white
head
on
it
that
left
some
lacing
it
has
a
lighter
nose
nice
but
not
much
to
it
maybe
some
wheat
lemon
and
spices
the
taste
is
good
but
a
little
light
also
floral
and
earthy
notes
ok
not
your
typical
summer
brewrather
than
just
pushing
out
the
usual
citrusinfused
wheat
or
blonde
ale
baxter
uses
both
lemongrass
and
kaffir
lime
leaves
on
top
of
the
lemon
and
lime
additions
each
sip
smacks
of
all
of
this
stays
drinkable
and
keeps
our
palates
in
check
baxter
making
the
summer
interesting
o
a
delicious
brew
for
a
hot
day
the
spices
are
a
pleasant
addition
overall
not
bad
i
have
had
it
a
couple
times
now
and
i
would
drink
this
if
it
was
offered
to
me
again
this
was
a
decent
offering
and
my
first
beer
from
baxter
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
tip
tap
room
it
was
surprisingly
clear
for
an
unfiltered
offering
the
golden
color
was
still
nice
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
tartness
of
the
citrus
was
a
bit
much
almost
to
the
point
of
being
sour
not
bad
overall
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
summer
beer
this
one
is
not
quite
a
lightthin
as
the
others
in
that
style
maybe
that
is
a
reflection
of
the
slightly
more
temperate
summers
they
experience
in
maine
low
in
abv
but
not
the
easiest
to
drink
and
not
sure
i
would
call
it
sessionable
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
low
abv
summer
beer
brewed
with
lemongrass
and
lime
they
dont
come
through
a
lot
in
the
nose
but
do
in
the
taste
a
nice
crisp
beer
worth
checking
out
o
really
solid
session
beer
for
the
summer
in
a
can
more
lavender
on
the
tongue
lightly
sweet
but
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
a
peppery
hop
kick
more
bitter
than
expected
the
body
is
as
expected
with
an
elevated
carbonation
level
o
another
great
beer
from
baxter
had
this
ontap
in
bar
harbor
as
well
and
its
just
as
good
o
i
think
id
like
this
more
dont
get
me
wrong
i
do
like
it
if
it
werent
so
bitter
throughout
it
makes
it
a
bit
more
difficult
to
really
session
but
it
is
possible
to
get
around
it
it
is
a
summer
ale
after
all
this
is
the
first
baxter
beer
ive
actually
thought
to
be
wellexecuted
it
is
refreshing
and
free
of
defects
an
asadvertised
summer
ale
alas
it
still
does
not
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
personally
odalmost
reminds
me
of
a
gin
and
tonic
with
a
lime
wedge
plugged
onto
the
lid
of
the
glass
very
acidic
rarely
do
you
get
lime
as
a
flavor
in
beer
besides
bud
light
lime
of
course
i
find
this
to
be
baxters
most
well
crafted
beer
but
it
doesnt
suit
my
beer
needs
nevertheless
this
is
a
far
beyond
average
summer
brew
and
it
is
worthy
of
purchase
poured
a
2
white
head
with
medium
life
the
body
is
a
slightly
hazed
light
yellow
it
smells
of
malt
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
but
also
has
a
nice
hops
backbone
and
its
the
hops
that
carry
through
in
a
medium
long
finish
quite
refresing
good
summer
ale
poured
from
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
very
bright
yellow
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
i
was
turned
off
though
by
the
copious
amounts
of
floaties
lemon
chunks
swirling
in
my
glass
i
guess
it
was
meant
to
be
drunk
straight
from
the
glass
as
i
didnt
find
it
very
visually
appealing
great
citrus
smell
very
fresh
and
fruity
flavor
the
huge
amounts
of
lemons
and
limes
come
through
mothfeel
was
not
too
tart
which
was
nice
i
found
this
to
be
a
flavorful
summer
ale
that
id
drink
again
straight
from
the
can
overall
not
bad
interesting
citrus
and
rind
spices
decent
hops
malts
and
wheat
flavors
underneath
add
a
nice
touch
good
carb
but
the
overall
spices
just
seem
not
where
i
want
them
to
be
maybe
cant
really
label
it
more
than
that
hands
down
the
best
summer
beer
ive
had
due
to
low
abv
its
full
of
flavor
despite
that
low
abv
and
it
comes
in
a
take
everywhere
can
my
only
qualm
is
that
the
aroma
is
so
striking
that
you
lose
a
lot
in
the
can
bring
a
solo
cup
the
body
is
medium
and
somewhat
sticky
overall
another
solid
offering
from
these
guys
im
sure
this
will
be
a
summer
staple
for
me
not
a
beer
to
drink
again
i
poured
two
to
see
if
the
first
can
was
an
anomaly
it
wasnt
o
another
good
beer
from
baxters
get
to
the
head
of
the
grill
line
summer
swelter
formerly
named
celsius
well
done
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
the
beer
is
a
bright
hazy
unfiltered
lemonyellow
coloring
with
a
light
frothy
low
profile
white
head
aromas
are
light
and
crisp
with
a
toasted
grain
backbone
and
citrusy
highlights
flavors
are
toasted
cereal
with
a
tangy
sweet
and
slightly
zesty
lemon
and
lime
blended
highlight
spiced
overtones
with
coriander
lemongrass
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
very
well
blended
and
remains
crisp
and
effervescent
overall
smooth
bodied
throughout
with
a
light
feel
despite
the
dynami
palate
the
aftertaste
is
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
graincereal
profile
the
finish
is
effervescent
light
and
has
a
slight
linger
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
sessionable
great
warm
weather
brew
edited
to
add
youll
probably
finish
it
too
fast
to
notice
but
you
get
a
nice
hit
of
lemon
as
it
warms
i
dont
even
like
root
beer
but
this
is
awesome
really
phenomenal
wow
i
cant
even
taste
the
alcohol
taste
just
like
root
beer
and
i
really
dont
know
what
to
say
about
it
but
it
is
really
good
in
a
strange
way
tastes
like
root
beer
not
even
like
alcoholic
root
beer
just
root
beer
cant
wait
to
find
a
higher
abv
version
not
really
sure
how
to
rate
this
beer
but
its
really
really
good
tastes
like
root
beer
not
root
beer
flavored
beer
but
just
straight
up
tasty
root
beer
pretty
incredible
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
tastes
like
very
good
root
beer
but
watch
out
first
couple
sips
i
loved
it
by
the
time
i
was
done
it
had
gotten
weird
basically
a
lower
carbonated
root
beer
soda
how
does
this
have
alcohol
in
it
pretty
good
but
dont
think
i
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
in
one
sitting
i
liked
the
10
better
as
the
alcohol
cut
the
sweetness
a
bit
more
so
wonderful
i
havent
had
a
soda
in
over
a
year
and
this
just
rang
true
o
to
be
honest
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
could
see
how
someone
could
confuse
this
with
a
root
beer
i
loved
it
looks
like
root
beer
smells
like
root
beer
must
be
root
beer
oh
wait
different
than
anything
ive
ever
had
my
favorite
hard
root
beer
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
6
pack
around
here
and
it
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
that
is
if
you
like
root
beer
of
course
unbelievably
similar
to
actual
root
beer
amazing
1st
taste
and
goes
down
smooth
and
tastefully
with
a
slight
boozy
ending
as
great
as
it
is
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
then
2
in
a
day
overall
would
love
to
always
have
a
6pack
handy
in
the
fridge
solid
solid
brew
must
try
taste
like
a
good
root
beer
dont
even
know
there
is
alcohol
in
it
overall
i
would
like
to
pick
the
right
day
and
drink
12
of
these
to
make
sure
it
has
alcohol
bottle
this
recently
and
aggressively
hit
massachusetts
distribution
clearly
all
of
these
root
beer
beers
are
highly
regarded
on
this
sight
so
this
is
apparently
an
actually
beer
brewed
with
flavor
added
is
it
a
mikes
hard
sort
of
scenario
i
truly
do
not
know
the
beer
pours
dark
clear
brown
looks
like
root
beer
the
smell
is
goddamn
root
beer
im
not
going
to
describe
specifics
its
root
beer
bro
sweet
christ
its
root
beer
in
the
tongue
the
only
difference
between
this
and
a
barqs
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
after
each
sip
very
sugary
and
bubbly
actually
made
my
cheeks
flush
this
is
beer
is
it
does
it
taste
good
because
it
tastes
like
root
beer
im
confused
again
im
not
the
biggest
root
beer
guy
anyway
but
hell
they
nailed
it
this
is
actually
insane
it
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
i
guess
i
expected
a
beer
with
root
beerlike
qualities
nope
this
is
a
root
beer
with
no
beerlike
qualities
i
dont
understand
how
it
was
crafted
to
taste
like
this
great
work
small
town
brewery
its
root
beer
almost
perfectly
realized
the
head
is
finer
and
more
uniform
than
the
irregular
foam
of
real
root
beer
and
the
flavor
carries
a
faint
harshness
of
alcohol
to
it
but
otherwise
it
is
spoton
totally
deviant
from
classic
beer
but
totally
delicious
cheers
smell
is
amazing
exactly
what
it
says
its
root
beer
taste
is
really
sweet
i
mean
really
sweet
i
cant
drink
much
of
this
but
im
impressed
with
nailing
what
was
intended
really
good
tastes
a
lot
like
root
beer
i
get
a
little
malthop
taste
on
the
finish
this
would
go
great
over
vanilla
ice
cream
hopefully
it
will
be
available
in
florida
soon
its
freaking
root
beer
people
not
sure
why
people
are
losing
their
gd
minds
over
this
it
tastes
like
root
beer
thats
it
nothing
more
nothing
less
a
good
root
beer
with
booze
in
it
this
is
straight
up
amazing
it
is
exactly
what
you
want
it
to
be
and
i
dont
see
how
it
could
be
improved
at
all
this
is
some
legit
stuff
right
here
looks
like
root
beer
smells
like
root
beer
tastes
like
root
beer
makes
a
good
vanilla
float
like
root
beer
no
alcohol
detectable
and
yet
its
there
dangerous
stuff
would
i
drink
this
all
the
time
no
but
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
much
perfect
after
a
4pk
myself
i
convinced
myself
i
liked
this
beer
more
for
the
novelty
than
the
actual
taste
a
strong
alcohol
odor
wafting
from
this
once
in
the
glass
very
close
to
that
of
vodka
the
vodka
smell
seemed
stronger
while
the
head
was
present
never
leaving
the
nose
throughout
the
drink
this
vanilla
bomb
does
not
taste
at
all
like
anything
an
adult
with
an
even
marginally
developed
palate
would
enjoy
its
a
vanilla
bomb
no
discernible
sarsaparilla
or
traditional
oak
notes
at
all
good
gateway
beer
for
12
year
olds
and
man
children
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
but
you
feel
it
after
a
couple
smells
just
like
root
beer
and
tastes
delicious
not
overly
sweet
and
does
a
great
job
of
highlighting
the
sassafras
i
wish
the
carbonation
would
have
been
higher
to
more
closely
resemble
that
of
a
root
beer
but
overall
this
is
pretty
damn
tasty
big
thanks
to
bshemansky
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
i
rate
this
highly
because
theyve
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
you
can
make
adult
rootbeer
floats
with
this
stuff
this
probably
would
have
been
my
favorite
beer
when
i
was
15
now
not
so
much
rating
it
as
a
beer
is
difficult
because
this
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
exactly
like
a
really
really
good
root
beer
well
i
like
it
and
i
think
they
hit
what
they
were
trying
to
brew
perfectly
so
i
will
rate
it
as
such
this
takes
me
back
to
when
i
was
a
kid
and
my
family
would
get
a
jug
of
root
beet
at
the
root
beer
stand
it
is
amazing
what
people
can
brew
not
a
lot
to
say
it
taste
like
root
beer
i
can
see
where
people
can
really
like
this
one
decent
brew
here
tastes
a
lot
like
root
beer
straight
up
with
alcohol
or
not
this
is
the
best
root
beer
ive
ever
had
epic
not
a
lot
of
say
about
this
one
other
than
that
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
not
a
beer
with
root
beer
flavors
exactly
like
root
beer
i
dug
it
as
did
most
people
and
i
couldnt
taste
any
alcohol
in
it
at
all
really
cool
dont
know
how
they
do
this
fantastic
way
too
sweet
for
me
tastes
more
like
bubble
gum
does
hide
the
alcohol
well
if
that
is
what
you
are
after
everything
else
is
root
beer
a
little
alcohol
aftertaste
if
you
like
root
beer
this
is
for
you
or
you
can
buy
your
favorite
root
beer
and
add
ever
clear
i
dont
know
id
say
its
a
novelty
and
i
can
definitely
see
where
some
would
enjoy
it
i
wasnt
crazy
about
it
though
unique
beer
not
really
something
id
want
all
of
the
time
but
maybe
if
your
in
the
mood
for
some
booze
that
tastes
like
rootbeer
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
should
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
im
the
only
person
i
know
that
isnt
raving
about
this
its
a
cool
idea
but
not
my
fancy
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
to
no
carbonation
the
aroma
is
big
and
rich
with
a
root
beer
scent
with
a
hint
of
booze
the
taste
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
root
beer
flavor
is
very
evident
with
little
bit
of
an
awkward
chalky
aftertaste
very
interesting
and
unique
to
say
the
least
low
b
3

just
like
youd
expect
its
root
beer
you
are
a
pretentious
d
bag
if
you
dont
like
this
brew
root
beer
smell
and
taste
is
spot
on
more
like
a
mixed
drink
than
beer
though
would
like
to
try
the
heavier
versions
it
is
good
but
it
would
be
great
if
they
had
more
carbonation
it
is
basically
like
drinking
a
flat
root
beer
there
is
absolutely
no
alcohol
taste
i
may
try
a
root
beer
float
with
this
overall
i
rated
this
as
world
class
in
smell
and
taste
because
it
does
smell
and
taste
exactly
like
root
beer
not
one
of
the
best
root
beers
but
certainly
isnt
a
mug
or
barqs
well
worth
the
price
and
i
cant
imagine
many
root
beer
fans
being
disappointed
with
this
i
dont
drink
pop
anymore
but
when
i
did
i
loved
root
beer
and
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
old
fashioned
root
beer
very
tasty
loved
this
beer
very
smooth
but
has
a
little
bite
at
the
end
could
be
dangerous
tastes
just
like
root
beer
i
had
no
idea
that
it
would
look
smell
and
taste
this
much
like
root
beer
i
gave
it
a
3
75
because
im
impressed
at
how
much
this
looks
and
smells
like
root
beer
but
i
really
dont
like
it
much
all
that
being
said
id
still
kind
of
like
to
try
the
19
version
to
see
if
all
the
added
abv
balances
out
the
super
sweetness
overall
this
is
awesome
if
you
love
root
beer
i
can
see
some
people
saying
that
this
is
too
sweet
and
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
one
ever
now
and
then
is
a
great
treat
impressive
this
is
not
only
spoton
as
a
root
beer
but
is
the
best
root
beer
ive
ever
had
no
hint
that
this
is
alcoholic
apart
from
the
label
there
is
not
much
to
say
about
this
other
than
it
is
indistinguishable
from
root
beer
it
is
an
interesting
gimmick
of
sorts
but
im
just
left
thinking
whats
the
point
this
is
a
novelty
that
is
way
over
hyped
tastes
like
someone
dumped
some
liquor
in
some
rootbeer
and
bottled
it
if
you
like
wine
coolers
this
is
your
thing
else
stay
away
from
it
drain
poor
yuck
good
if
you
like
rootbeer
this
is
not
your
fathers
root
beer
its
entirely
too
sweet
for
what
a
good
root
beer
aims
at
and
theres
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
sort
of
falls
into
more
of
a
diet
root
beer
one
that
brings
the
mouth
feel
of
artificial
sweeteners
into
the
picture
as
well
you
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
which
is
probably
a
very
good
thing
oh
i
found
it
it
took
a
swishing
and
yeah
this
is
just
not
working
and
its
certainly
not
a
root
beer
that
i
would
want
my
father
to
drink
either
disclaimer
i
love
root
beer
looks
like
a
normal
root
beer
with
its
rich
brown
color
great
carbonation
smells
similar
to
dads
root
beer
initially
with
that
distinctive
root
beer
spice
but
then
opens
up
with
artificial
caramel
and
a
weird
take
on
root
beer
bottle
caps
it
tastes
like
the
smell
of
an
overheating
vacuum
and
cheap
whiskey
with
a
hint
of
burnt
sugar
im
talking
about
a
pot
of
sugar
left
on
the
stove
way
too
long
after
some
ones
first
attempt
at
making
caramel
the
cheap
whiskey
flavor
isnt
the
only
alcohol
flavor
present
by
no
means
the
aftertaste
tastes
like
offbrand
cough
syrup
with
black
licorice
lit
on
fire
with
a
blow
torch
biggest
disappointment
in
awhile
after
this
and
the
abysmal
sprechers
hard
root
beer
i
am
convinced
alcohol
ruins
root
beer
now
i
need
to
go
drink
some
delicious
root
beer
like
boylans
stewarts
frostop
dads
jones
etc
dont
buy
into
the
hype
i
can
honestly
say
that
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
im
surprised
its
rated
so
highly
its
probably
the
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
had
not
crazy
about
it
this
literally
looks
like
smells
like
and
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
aw
root
beer
specifically
thanks
to
a
heavy
vanilla
presence
this
is
a
brewing
marvel
though
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
pound
these
just
like
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
1
root
beer
in
a
sitting
it
really
is
remarkable
though
very
very
tasty
i
found
it
impossible
to
finish
a
8oz
pour
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
and
gives
the
beer
a
cola
like
quality
other
thoughts
i
was
waiting
for
wilford
brimley
to
jump
out
of
my
glass
and
tell
me
i
have
the
diabetes
from
drinking
this
sugar
filled
mess
gimicky
as
shit
but
cool
to
show
people
who
dont
like
or
are
very
picky
about
beer
honestly
if
you
poured
someone
a
glass
of
this
and
didnt
tell
them
it
was
alcoholic
they
would
never
be
able
to
tell
its
handsdown
one
of
the
best
root
beers
ive
ever
had
let
alone
having
booze
in
it
cant
wait
to
try
the
10
and
19
where
has
this
been
all
my
life
not
a
fan
of
rootbeer
this
beer
is
waaaay
to
sweet
for
me
a
novelty
nothing
more
certainly
a
brewing
accomplishment
but
just
comes
across
as
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
im
not
feeling
this
a
brewing
feat
maybe
but
this
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
good
root
beer
let
alone
a
root
beer
with
an
abv
behind
it
glad
i
got
a
crack
at
it
though
this
is
not
beer
way
to
sweet
and
just
not
great
this
is
a
5
as
it
tastes
like
the
name
suggests
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
though
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
was
hoping
more
for
a
root
beer
flavored
beer
instead
it
is
more
accurately
called
an
alcoholic
root
beer
wish
the
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
was
more
like
a
beer
o
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
would
i
ever
want
to
drink
this
probably
not
and
even
if
i
did
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
in
my
opinion
its
just
ok
hard
to
believe
this
is
actually
beer
dug
it
bizarre
o
when
i
had
first
heard
of
the
19
5
version
of
this
i
really
wanted
to
try
it
because
i
love
root
beer
now
that
ive
had
this
version
though
im
not
sure
if
its
something
im
into
i
like
to
chug
my
root
beer
and
i
cant
approach
this
the
same
way
sipping
it
is
fine
but
the
alcohol
throws
off
my
perception
of
what
im
drinking
then
theres
that
cough
syrup
aftertaste
that
just
bothers
me
plus
theres
not
as
much
carbonation
as
in
actual
root
beer
part
of
the
reason
i
like
root
beer
is
for
that
sharp
fizz
but
theres
almost
none
here
fine
for
what
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
though
it
tastes
like
root
beer
cool
but
then
it
becomes
super
cloying
and
annoying
tastes
like
root
beer
but
isnt
beer
great
to
have
a
couple
times
the
20
tastes
close
to
the
6
delicious
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
if
you
like
root
beer
youre
gonna
love
this
i
love
root
beer
only
problem
is
this
thing
is
sickly
sweet
i
could
only
finish
about
13
of
the
bottle
even
my
wife
who
is
a
sugaraholic
could
only
handle
a
few
sips
solid
offering
but
you
may
wanna
break
this
thing
up
into
three
4
oz
pours
with
friends
if
not
for
the
intense
sugar
rush
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
this
beer
is
called
not
your
fathers
root
beer
so
do
not
expect
a
beer
expect
the
best
root
beer
you
have
ever
tasted
but
at
5
9
the
beer
is
hard
to
taste
but
this
is
awesome
the
look
is
nice
i
like
the
old
school
feel
of
it
this
is
just
like
regular
root
beer
but
its
beer
root
beer
all
the
way
slight
hint
of
alcohol
o
4
5
was
surprised
just
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
definitely
something
off
the
normal
beaten
path
if
you
enjoy
root
beer
youll
really
enjoy
this
drinks
like
a
really
high
quality
root
beer
soda
such
as
jones
soda
or
bjs
inhouse
brewed
soda
damn
good
beer
this
coming
from
a
guy
who
hates
root
beer
this
is
by
far
the
best
alcoholic
root
beer
ive
ever
had
tastes
like
root
beer
this
is
crazy
literally
tastes
and
looks
exactly
like
rootbeer
not
quite
as
syrupy
as
the
10
7
but
just
as
good
really
love
this
beer
if
you
like
rootbeer
you
will
like
this
okay
so
my
ratingreview
of
this
is
based
off
of
personal
opinion
of
what
an
ale
should
be
not
what
an
ale
trying
to
be
something
else
is
looks
like
a
carbonated
dark
brown
popsoda
very
little
ale
like
qualities
to
the
appearance
smells
like
a
high
quality
craft
root
beer
also
it
tastes
like
a
great
root
beer
more
like
a
traditional
soda
pop
and
not
an
ale
or
stout
beyond
that
i
really
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
brew
other
than
that
it
is
a
tasty
gimmick
not
really
an
ale
or
stout
bottom
line
is
if
you
enjoy
flavorful
sweet
drinks
and
dont
mind
getting
tipsy
the
this
beer
is
the
perfect
for
you
it
is
called
a
dark
lager
but
it
is
really
just
amazing
tasting
root
beer
in
disguise
please
dont
blame
me
once
you
are
hooked
thank
you
much
better
on
tap
the
bottled
version
is
good
on
tap
is
outstanding
the
bottled
version
is
much
sweeter
and
lacks
the
carbonation
i
found
myself
having
one
bottle
at
a
time
all
the
stomach
could
handle
o
interesting
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
glad
i
tried
it
maybe
i
will
get
the
opportunity
to
try
one
of
the
higher
abv
versions
since
this
might
offset
the
sweetness
somewhat
tastes
really
bad
and
id
rather
not
mix
beer
and
root
beer
ever
again
tastes
bad
would
rather
just
drink
beer
or
root
beer
its
taken
the
time
for
this
to
get
bottled
and
distributed
in
order
for
me
to
try
this
particular
version
it
pours
a
clear
midnight
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
light
tan
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
sweet
root
beer
frankly
with
some
vanilla
and
pie
spices
crackling
along
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
sweet
and
spicy
nature
of
root
beer
shining
throughout
unlike
the
higher
abv
versions
there
isnt
even
the
slightest
twinge
of
booze
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
this
is
damn
tasty
straight
up
o
really
surprised
how
much
this
tastes
like
root
beer
would
love
to
get
a
hold
of
the
bigger
variants
of
this
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
the
bourbon
barrel
is
pretty
mild
but
adds
a
lot
of
vanilla
notes
to
this
beverage
i
dont
know
if
i
would
consider
this
a
beer
though
this
is
a
cool
novelty
item
that
i
think
is
pretty
well
done
12oz
at
a
time
is
plenty
for
me
because
it
is
pretty
sweet
now
i
would
not
mind
trying
the
10
and
19
5
abv
versions
of
this
beer
overall
this
smells
incredible
but
without
the
high
abv
like
its
father
and
grandfather
10
19
5
this
is
just
way
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
great
for
a
root
beer
float
however
good
flavor
but
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
taste
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
1
of
these
per
night
o
this
is
pretty
spot
on
and
a
nice
option
to
switch
it
up
worth
a
try
this
tastes
exactly
like
a
root
beer
should
my
wife
loved
it
as
a
float
this
is
a
ok
beer
if
you
like
root
beer
which
i
do
but
a
one
time
novelty
beer
worth
trying
very
good
as
everyone
else
says
it
tastes
just
like
root
beer
and
cannot
even
taste
the
alcohol
would
give
it
a
5
but
really
sweet
and
hard
to
have
more
than
1
not
a
soda
fan
either
though
so
take
with
a
grain
of
salt
im
not
going
to
spend
time
trying
to
get
all
wordy
here
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
i
actually
like
this
version
better
than
the
10
because
it
removes
the
boozy
aspect
its
pretty
unreal
how
much
this
mimics
root
beer
it
is
root
beer
through
and
through
taste
smell
look
viscosity
its
delicious
and
dangerous
does
not
feel
like
im
consuming
alcohol
at
all
it
tasted
just
like
root
beer
barrels
before
i
knew
it
the
six
pack
was
gone
and
i
was
drunk
when
compared
to
non
alcoholic
root
beer
it
tastes
better
than
anything
out
there
huge
thanks
go
out
to
blue
dream
for
basically
just
sending
this
to
me
for
nothing
top
notch
ba
i
really
couldnt
figure
out
a
way
to
take
points
away
not
only
is
it
one
of
my
favorite
craft
root
beers
out
there
theres
booze
that
is
almost
undetectable
i
dont
understand
the
wizardry
involved
and
maybe
its
best
i
leave
it
a
mystery
all
i
know
is
im
now
seeking
out
all
variations
and
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
got
to
taste
this
and
it
is
the
real
deal
i
did
not
taste
any
alcohol
tastes
better
than
aw
dangerously
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
a
game
changer
id
pick
it
up
in
a
heartbeat
if
it
was
available
in
my
region
poured
basically
like
root
beer
looks
and
smells
like
root
beer
tastes
like
root
beer
and
a
pretty
decent
root
beer
at
that
basically
tastes
like
a
good
root
beer
mixed
with
vodka
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
10
while
the
10
tastes
completely
like
root
beer
this
version
allows
for
the
taste
of
alcohol
to
seep
through
not
as
clean
of
an
after
taste
so
glad
its
in
6
packs
now
but
wish
they
wouldnt
have
messed
with
the
abv
thank
you
for
making
a
great
beer
o
i
am
amazed
at
the
marvel
that
is
small
town
brewing
that
they
can
put
out
this
root
beer
in
different
abv
level
and
it
all
taste
the
same
except
the
higher
you
go
the
faster
you
crash
believe
me
i
found
this
out
personally
well
it
tastes
like
my
dads
root
beer
and
every
other
root
beer
which
is
to
say
that
its
delicious
assuming
you
enjoy
root
beer
wonder
what
ice
cream
would
taste
like
with
it
im
not
opposed
to
brewing
with
adjuncts
but
this
might
as
well
just
be
a
can
of
soda
with
a
shot
of
vodka
added
and
yes
im
dinging
it
on
appearance
for
using
artificial
coloring
growing
up
i
remeber
drinking
dads
rootbeer
with
my
dad
it
was
our
root
beer
of
choice
at
home
so
naturally
even
the
name
not
your
fathers
root
beer
had
me
then
the
taste
incredible
taste
just
like
the
best
root
beer
youve
ever
had
similar
to
the
tastes
of
dads
lots
of
spices
and
bite
and
has
a
great
ale
after
taste
that
is
incredibly
smooth
on
the
palate
if
you
like
root
beer
you
will
love
this
beer
this
tastes
like
some
of
the
root
beer
ive
ever
had
with
alcohol
bonus
you
gotta
try
this
tastes
just
like
rootbeer
have
an
open
mind
that
it
isnt
your
traditional
beer
and
you
have
it
made
tastes
and
smells
so
much
like
root
beer
and
cannot
even
taste
the
alcohol
its
great
in
small
portions
but
it
is
cloying
i
couldnt
finish
my
10oz
pour
because
it
started
to
get
too
sweet
definitely
worth
trying
overall
shitty
smells
like
root
beer
a
touch
of
vanilla
tastes
straight
up
like
root
beer
no
alcohol
taste
a
bit
sweet
wow
an
alcoholic
root
beerbeer
at
10
abv
you
say
i
had
heard
about
this
from
a
colleague
at
work
who
raved
about
it
to
me
saw
it
on
tap
and
had
to
try
for
myself
draft
pour
into
snifter
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
cola
hue
and
very
light
carbonation
present
great
presence
of
vanilla
and
toasted
oak
the
booziness
only
becomes
more
apparent
when
this
one
warms
up
otherwise
it
is
soda
pop
all
the
way
a
unique
tasting
experience
and
one
to
definitely
snap
up
if
you
see
it
in
your
area
i
like
root
beer
i
love
beer
this
is
the
most
overrated
beer
imo
ever
and
people
trade
for
it
this
beer
is
top
notch
o
delicious
it
tastes
good
but
theres
absolutely
nothing
remarkable
about
it
yeah
its10
abv
so
in
high
school
this
would
have
been
deadly
people
either
love
or
hate
this
small
town
accomplished
exactly
what
they
set
out
to
do
brew
the
very
best
root
beer
flavored
strong
ale
it
is
easily
the
best
root
beer
brew
ive
ever
had
it
is
very
very
sweet
but
packed
with
real
root
beer
flavor
very
easy
to
forget
what
youre
drinking
i
prefer
the
10
abvtap
only
version
over
the
5
9
version
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
festival
in
wauconda
illinois
this
taste
was
unexpected
for
sure
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
root
beer
with
only
a
minor
hint
i
was
drinking
an
alcoholic
drink
i
enjoyed
several
glasses
and
the
taste
never
dulled
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
home
made
style
root
beer
unfreaking
believable
ive
never
got
sick
drinking
root
beer
until
now
this
is
a
short
review
because
theres
not
really
much
you
can
say
this
beer
tastes
incredibly
close
to
root
beer
its
sweet
and
syrupy
and
spicy
and
filled
with
herbs
i
have
no
idea
how
they
made
it
did
they
mix
grain
alcohol
into
a
keg
of
barqs
maybe
i
dont
care
its
great
do
you
like
root
beer
you
will
like
this
beverage
if
you
think
that
regular
nondiet
that
is
root
beer
is
too
sweet
then
you
should
not
even
bother
trying
this
this
is
not
beer
what
an
absolute
joke
lets
face
it
this
beer
is
just
a
way
for
people
to
get
loaded
and
pretend
that
they
are
experienced
beer
drinkers
overall
i
honestly
cant
think
of
a
better
way
to
explain
this
beer
its
root
beer
with
alcohol
though
you
cant
even
taste
the
alcohol
or
at
least
i
couldnt
if
you
like
root
beer
you
will
love
this
beer
if
not
then
you
probably
wont
like
it
thats
all
there
is
to
it
since
i
love
root
beer
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
was
in
chicago
last
week
for
some
training
for
work
me
and
my
coworkers
stopped
by
harry
carays
7th
inning
stretch
restaurant
and
i
saw
not
your
fathers
root
beer
on
the
menu
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
i
was
glad
i
ordered
a
glass
of
it
this
brew
is
incredibly
tasty
the
version
i
was
served
was
the
10
abv
like
several
of
the
other
reviews
have
stated
you
do
not
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
the
flavor
is
a
delicious
creamysweet
root
beer
flavor
the
root
beer
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
freshly
poured
aw
root
beer
served
at
the
root
beer
stand
this
is
in
contrast
to
say
a
flavor
like
a
barqs
or
mug
root
beer
the
creaminess
and
hints
of
vanilla
come
through
slightly
at
the
finish
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
excellent
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
looking
at
the
small
town
brewerys
website
it
appears
that
it
is
only
available
in
illinois
with
me
being
in
ohio
i
am
hoping
to
find
a
local
place
that
can
order
some
for
me
small
town
brewery
really
should
consider
a
wider
distribution
than
just
within
illinois
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
big
success
wherever
it
is
sold
can
not
give
anything
a
perfect
score
because
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
but
this
beer
is
exactly
what
u
think
it
is
10
abv
and
tastes
just
like
root
beer
it
is
really
sweet
with
strong
sarsaparilla
and
vanilla
you
have
to
remind
people
that
there
is
alcohol
in
it
had
this
on
tap
in
chicago
last
spring
incredible
root
beer
flavorcouldnt
tell
it
was
anything
other
than
root
beer
very
sweet
and
a
heavy
hitter
if
youre
not
careful
tastes
like
aw
rootbeer
going
to
echo
trifecta1
here
except
to
add
that
this
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
very
good
root
beer
i
e
without
the
cloying
sweetness
of
hfcs
inviting
spicy
aromas
of
vanilla
sarsparilla
taste
follows
i
took
my
time
to
finish
my
3
pint
but
this
is
easily
crushable
may
look
thin
but
very
creamy
overall
its
loaded
with
vanilla
its
just
root
beer
with
alcohol
way
too
sweet
for
me
its
premium
root
beer
looks
like
root
beer
smells
like
root
beer
feels
like
root
beer
tastes
like
root
beer
alcohol
is
well
hidden
any
qualities
that
resemble
beer
are
hidden
how
they
brewed
this
beast
is
a
mystery
but
it
is
tasty
and
no
one
can
deny
that
o
this
beer
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
now
that
i
have
seen
a
picture
of
a
bottle
of
it
on
ba
i
am
determined
to
find
it
and
stock
my
fridge
with
it
if
you
can
find
this
beer
in
bottles
or
if
you
can
purchase
a
keg
buy
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
that
is
if
you
like
root
beer
i
could
see
this
one
as
great
dessert
beer
in
talking
to
the
manager
he
said
this
is
one
of
their
top
five
sellers
which
surprised
me
given
their
great
tap
choices
but
upon
drinking
it
i
can
now
see
why
well
done
lucky
to
try
this
at
a
tasting
event
in
memphis
i
will
simply
echo
what
reviewers
have
said
this
is
ridiculous
i
cannot
believe
this
is
10
abv
i
cant
even
believe
its
alcoholic
it
tastes
like
really
good
craft
root
beer
really
sweet
not
heavily
carbonated
wish
i
could
buy
this
all
the
time
its
one
of
the
most
surprising
beers
ive
ever
tasted
bravo
small
town
brewery
not
your
fathers
root
beer
45
aside
from
my
tasting
glass
i
made
myself
a
root
beer
float
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
and
it
is
a
real
throwback
it
works
perfectly
i
highly
recommend
it
22oz

it

aged
hint
of

sassafras
root

with

must
go
back
to
kroger
to
get
jenis

cream
for
a
5star

now
starting
to
feel
the
coolness
through
my

o
this
is
the
best
craft
root
beer
ive
had
alcoholic
or
not
so
ridiculously
creamy
which
makes
it
stand
above
the
rest
im
not
a
huge
soda
drinker
but
honestly
if
this
were
available
to
me
locally
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
a
few
bottles
on
hand
at
all
times
best
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
brown
with
minimal
head
looks
just
like
root
beer
the
nose
is
ridiculous
is
this
really
beer
smells
like
a
nice
creamy
root
beer
heavy
notes
of
vanilla
saspirilla
and
birch
come
through
literally
nothing
in
here
smells
like
there
is
a
beer
in
there
no
hop
bitterness
no
yeasty
notes
nothing
and
im
totally
okay
with
that
taste
is
surprise
surprise
root
beer
a
pretty
heavy
sweetness
in
the
middle
along
with
all
the
notes
that
a
good
root
beer
delivers
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
somewhat
viscous
aside
from
a
little
hint
of
booziness
at
the
end
this
beer
tastes
identical
to
root
beer
i
cant
believe
that
10
of
alcohol
is
hidden
within
this
beverage
this
could
be
dangerous
i
acquired
this
via
trade
from
bluedream
thank
you
sir
it
was
shipped
to
me
in
swing
top
bottles
securely
fastened
and
taped
so
i
will
call
it
a
growler
for
reviewing
purposes
i
poured
it
into
a
mug
as
i
thought
a
root
beer
should
be
served
it
looks
a
lot
like
root
beer
the
head
isnt
quite
as
frothy
as
a
root
beer
but
that
is
probably
due
to
being
pours
into
a
bottle
and
shipped
two
states
away
basically
this
looks
and
smells
like
a
root
beer
it
smells
exactly
like
it
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
tastes
exactly
like
root
beer
i
am
not
a
big
root
beer
drinker
but
the
thought
of
a
10
abv
root
beer
is
appealing
the
only
thing
that
detracts
is
that
when
it
warms
i
get
a
little
alcohol
taste
as
long
as
it
is
ice
cold
it
is
root
beer
all
the
way
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
but
once
again
that
goes
back
to
the
pouring
and
shipping
overall
it
is
fantastic
i
wish
i
had
some
ice
cream
to
make
a
float
with
it
can
you
imagine
a
10
ice
cream
float
i
am
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
this
this
stuff
is
scary
as
the
drinkability
and
high
abv
make
a
highly
potent
combination
i
tell
you
what
put
this
against
any
of
the
root
beer
brands
in
a
blind
taste
taste
and
watch
out
youll
have
a
bunch
of
drunk
adolescents
the
beer
was
root
beer
in
appearance
no
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
was
root
beer
the
taste
was
root
beer
the
mouthfeel
felt
like
a
slightly
more
body
than
a
root
beer
overall
i
thought
i
was
drinking
root
beer
wait
maybe
i
was
who
knows
i
would
hate
to
think
the
establishment
was
selling
a
glass
of
root
beer
for
8
it
mimics
a
good
craft
root
beer
in
look
taste
smell
and
mouth
feel
the
carbonation
is
refreshingly
low
i
recommend
it
d
as
far
as
hard
root
beer
goes
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
curious
what
the
base
beer
is
as
im
not
sure
id
even
guess
there
was
beer
in
here
at
all
in
any
case
enjoyed
my
mug
and
would
order
again
seems
to
be
ontap
a
lot
in
boystown
for
some
reason
overall
if
i
knew
about
this
when
i
was
younger
i
would
be
an
alcoholic
overall
hands
down
the
best
hard
root
beer
ive
had
to
date
aside
from
their
heftier
not
your
grandfathers
variant
httpsfindmybeer
combeerssmalltownnotyourfathersrootbeer
impressive
and
im
glad
i
had
it
but
i
have
no
desire
to
try
it
again
if
youre
ever
in
the
illinois
area
seek
out
a
place
that
has
this
beer
search
far
and
wide
for
you
while
youre
there
and
try
it
you
may
find
yourself
as
happy
then
sad
as
i
did
file
this
away
next
to
four
loko
limearita
and
mikes
hard
lemonade
pass
the
only
real
critique
i
could
offer
is
that
its
perhaps
too
sweetsyrupy
but
this
is
an
insane
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
do
not
pass
it
up
man
its
taste
just
like
rootbeer
i
couldnt
between
the
taste
of
this
very
smooth
with
no
after
taste
its
even
smells
like
rootbeer
cant
wait
to
taste
the
stronger
one
if
you
have
the
change
to
try
it
and
you
like
rootbeer
you
wont
be
disapponited
at
all
be
careful
with
it
it
would
be
very
easy
to
over
indulge
i
am
thinking
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
as
a
float
you
could
call
it
a
drunken
cow
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
very
unique
style
that
hardly
tastes
like
a
beer
at
all
i
have
found
myself
craving
it
since
i
tried
it
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
find
it
on
tap
a
friend
had
a
keg
of
this
at
his
place
so
i
tried
a
glass
only
had
one
because
of
how
dangerously
drinkable
this
stuff
is
wow
smells
like
a
root
beer
but
better
somehow
taste
is
fresh
root
beer
maybe
a
little
creamier
with
some
vanilla
hints
in
there
no
detectable
alcohol
whatsoever
which
is
what
makes
it
so
dangerous
this
was
definitely
a
hit
at
the
party
seek
this
out
if
you
can
i
will
be
looking
to
buy
a
5
gal
keg
asap
finally
putting
down
my
thoughts
on
the
10
version
of
this
ridiculousness
it
pours
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
molasses
mild
wintergreen
cola
and
even
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
maple
syrup
frankly
it
smells
like
root
beer
yup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
a
traditionaltasting
root
beer
with
a
slight
intimation
that
there
might
be
some
alcohol
back
there
somewhere
imagine
your
uncle
not
the
creepy
one
though
surreptitiously
spiking
his
own
soda
during
an
otherwise
boring
family
party
then
possibly
youre
not
entirely
sure
though
doing
the
same
for
you
despite
your
youth
yup
the
body
is
a
fluffy
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
tasty
beverage
one
that
combines
my
love
for
a
wellmade
root
beer
with
my
love
for
a
goodtasting
beer
i
cant
say
this
vehemently
enough
get
some
alcoholic
root
beer
tastes
like
a
really
well
made
root
beer
no
real
sense
of
any
booze
root
beer
color
dark
smells
like
a
great
root
beer
herbal
fuller
bodied
than
a
nonalcoholic
root
beer
how
they
do
this
is
a
mystery
to
me
i
love
root
beer
and
of
course
i
love
this
stuff

itll
work
in
a
pinch
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
has
a
really
smooth
drinkable
feel
that
goes
down
easy
and
barely
makes
you
blink
before
your
glass
is
almost
gone
there
a
wonderful
crispness
here
that
is
just
a
pleasure
not
one
of
jacks
abbeys
finest
a
decent
beer
to
try
you
know
this
really
makes
me
think
of
a
witbier
more
than
anything
else
good
toasted
malt
coriander
and
lemongrass
character
mild
finish
a
rapidly
dissipating
white
head
caps
this
orange
beer
resulting
in
a
rather
clear
juicelike
pour
the
nose
is
solid
bready
and
clean
with
the
wheat
particularly
noticeable
the
spice
additions
complement
this
aspect
quite
well
lemony
and
citrusy
with
some
herbal
characteristics
this
seems
to
suggest
that
the
brewers
were
striving
to
interpret
a
saison
and
a
witbier
as
a
lager
faint
coriander
character
is
present
as
well
the
palate
opens
juicy
mildly
sweet
with
honey
bread
and
the
orange
peel
lending
a
big
juiciness
the
coriander
appears
midpalate
along
with
the
floral
chamomile
mildly
earthy
too
hop
character
is
light
drying
on
the
finish
mildly
watery
disappointingly
so
this
beer
is
crisp
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
wonderful
lingering
chamomile
flavor
on
the
finish
refreshing
stuff
this
might
just
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
a
tasty
and
unique
beer
strange
beer
not
one
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
or
would
return
to
i
wouldnt
call
it
bad
but
this
recipe
is
illconceived
for
my
tastes
and
it
doesnt
really
deliver
as
a
summer
refreshertype
beer
either
there
really
is
not
much
to
this
beer
but
i
thought
is
was
very
good
i
killed
a
few
of
these
sitting
on
the
deck
of
our
beach
cottege
in
seabrook
nh
jacks
abby
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
brewers
and
they
have
a
way
of
taking
a
very
simple
summer
lager
and
making
it
quaffable
and
interesting
o
i
suppose
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
lager
version
of
a
wit
yeah
i
guess
so
however
while
i
understand
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
light
and
subtle
there
really
just
isnt
much
going
on
on
tap
hazy
pale
yellow
pour
clean
malts
crisp
and
light
but
flavorful
with
citrus
and
mild
herb
element
good
mouthfeel
with
light
active
carbonation
this
is
tasty
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
overall
a
great
summer
beer
very
well
done
recommended
overall
a
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
with
a
perfect
balance
between
wheat
spice
and
beer
pick
one
up
good
beer
repeatable
pours
a
cloudy
and
beautiful
pale
yellow
with
a
short
head
of
loose
white
foam
that
falls
fast
and
does
not
leave
any
lace
the
middle
of
the
beer
seems
to
glow
a
bit
with
a
light
as
it
passes
through
the
haze
the
nose
is
gracefull
and
has
the
malt
up
front
wheat
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
the
corriander
laid
in
earthy
so
its
what
but
a
bit
edgy
theres
chamomille
and
thats
floral
and
sweet
theres
a
soft
breath
of
lemongrass
faintly
in
the
background
and
the
orange
peel
comes
up
earthy
to
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
subtle
but
spicy
as
the
ingredients
combine
they
create
a
very
unique
flavor
the
what
is
dry
and
crisp
the
chamomille
floral
and
sweet
the
lemon
grass
is
also
faint
on
the
palate
the
surprise
is
the
subtle
and
gentle
orange
its
not
loud
but
it
is
powerfull
it
too
has
an
earthiness
but
it
brings
the
sweetness
of
the
orange
t
the
drink
in
a
way
that
is
light
yet
juicy
drinks
softly
and
pleasantly
crisp
lager
carbonation
that
is
perfect
with
a
just
enough
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
in
defiance
of
the
spicy
character
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bells
oberon
not
a
very
impressive
beer
but
definitely
a
good
step
up
from
bells
attempt
at
summer
wheat
alelager
o
a
very
good
lager
would
revisit
on
a
hot
day
i
do
not
like
coriander
and
generally
stay
away
from
it
but
it
is
subtle
here
not
overwhelming
as
is
usually
the
case
pale
gold
color
with
great
head
retention
and
some
nice
patches
of
lacing
the
aroma
and
taste
are
loaded
with
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
bottle
bready
wheat
malt
coriander
orange
lemon
and
peppery
yeast
as
with
all
jacks
abby
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
its
creamy
while
still
being
crisp
and
very
clean
im
surprised
that
this
isnt
rated
more
highly
as
i
thought
it
was
really
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
ive
been
really
impressed
with
all
of
the
jacks
abby
beers
that
ive
had
and
i
hope
that
lagers
become
more
widelybrewed
when
done
well
they
can
be
very
special
thanks
a
ton
for
the
beer
jared
o
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
a
bit
sweet
for
what
i
look
for
but
i
dug
it
overall
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
it
was
really
light
on
flavor
but
also
kind
of
refreshing
a
mediocre
beer
overall
that
could
use
some
more
flavor
solid
stuff
perfect
amount
of
spices
and
fruit
melds
well
with
the
wheat
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
for
that
refreshment
aspect
but
solid
overall
and
quite
unique
i
can
smell
a
lot
of
citrus
and
spicyness
a
lot
like
a
belgian
witbeer
oh
this
is
really
good
not
as
much
spice
as
in
the
nose
but
i
can
definitely
taste
orange
in
there
a
lot
of
floral
notes
as
well
goes
down
really
smooth
and
its
as
refreshing
as
a
hefeweizen
with
all
the
added
crispness
and
cleanliness
of
a
lager
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
i
can
taste
the
lemongrass
in
it
as
well
but
id
rather
drink
this
one
cold
its
definitely
a
summer
beer
o
a
nice
wheat
lager
with
plenty
of
flavor
possibly
a
little
heavy
on
all
the
spices
but
if
thats
your
thing
then
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
you
easy
to
drink
regardless
especially
with
the
abv
price
reflects
that
at
2
69
for
a
500
ml
bottle
as
with
every
brew
from
this
brewery
it
doesnt
hurt
to
pick
up
at
least
a
bottle
notes
such
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
good
anytime
cheers
overall
very
nice
take
on
a
lagered
witbier
and
definitely
worth
trying
o
nicely
put
together
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
pushes
me
to
continue
my
exploration
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
pale
and
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
bright
eggshell
white
head
of
smooth
bubbles
on
top
the
head
sits
at
a
little
over
a
fingers
width
and
leaves
a
lacing
of
medium
thick
sheets
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
properly
cloudy
with
a
wheat
protein
haze
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
that
are
slowly
working
their
way
to
the
beers
head
on
the
nose
the
beer
tastes
clean
and
light
with
whiffs
of
cardamom
and
citrus
orange
peel
interplaying
with
light
wheat
flakes
the
orange
occasionally
steps
over
into
a
more
lemony
flavor
on
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
crisply
sweet
with
light
bitter
spice
and
a
touch
of
citric
tartness
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
clean
wheat
malt
that
slowly
builds
towards
a
full
bodied
wheat
flake
flavor
as
the
wheat
flavor
builds
spices
move
in
on
the
tongue
to
give
big
bursts
of
cardamom
and
then
a
snap
of
citric
orange
peel
and
lemongrass
and
just
a
touch
of
chamomile
the
finish
is
a
whirlpool
of
all
the
flavors
with
a
final
hiccup
of
wheat
flakes
and
the
after
taste
of
light
clean
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
citric
tart
bite
of
lemon
on
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
plus
side
of
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
and
fluffy
carbonation
that
snaps
the
tongue
at
the
beginning
of
the
sip
and
then
cradles
it
the
mouth
is
left
wet
with
acid
neutralizing
spittle
and
begging
for
more
beer
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
summer
beer
and
a
great
light
sipper
with
terrific
flavor
and
complex
simplicity
i
love
the
spices
and
the
citric
snap
on
the
palate
and
i
could
knockback
this
beer
all
day
long
they
should
can
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
put
back
this
summer
try
this
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
this
is
a
brew
that
i
have
found
myself
coming
back
to
time
and
time
again
as
a
personal
preference
for
a
sessionlike
beer
it
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
so
it
goes
down
very
smooth
its
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
which
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
compliment
any
meal
and
my
favorite
part
about
all
jacks
abby
beers
beside
the
creativity
is
its
affordable
as
hell
o
excellent
witbiers
arent
a
very
popular
style
but
when
they
are
done
right
they
are
exceptional
and
this
beer
is
delicious
and
super
drinkable
perfect
for
summer
and
at
4
8
its
something
that
id
love
to
drink
all
day
long
in
the
heat
lawnmower
beer
to
the
max
like
it
a
lot
odjacks
abby
is
my
favorite
ma
brewery
speaking
in
a
very
broad
sense
they
make
two
types
of
beer
1
wacky
yet
decent
lagers
and
2
divinely
hoppy
lagers
that
are
better
than
90
of
all
the
ipas
i
have
tried
this
brew
is
in
the
former
category
but
its
still
damn
good
at

a

mdo
supremely
smooth
lightly

and
a
clean
and
tasty

written

this

its

somewhat

weisse
taste
is
a
bit
subdued
but
is
comprised
of
chamomile
a
light
lemony
quality
and
just
a
kiss
of
wheat
there
is
an
extremely
faint
orange
presence
towards
the
finish
that
drops
off
almost
as
soon
as
you
experience
it
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
and
just
a
hint
of
astringency
expressed
as
a
light
tingle
towards
the
back
and
side
of
the
tongue
overall
a
decent
albeit
not
particularly
flavorful
witbier
there
are
definitely
some
interesting
nuances
but
the
spiciness
ones
tends
to
associate
with
the
style
is
not
really
present
nonetheless
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
i
like
this
one
a
light
yet
relatively
flavorful
summer
brew
that
said
it
doesnt
exactly
grab
me
the
way
i
expected
or
hoped
maybe
i
was
spoiled
by
the
brilliance
of
hoponius
union
well
worth
a
try
though
especially
for
anyone
seeking
a
lighter
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
light
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
bready
pilsner
a
spicy
wheat
malt
spicy
lemony
aroma
with
a
hint
of
grass
the
taste
is
malty
and
grainy
with
spice
from
the
wheat
and
the
spices
lemony
and
honey
sweetness
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
grainy
mouthfeel
nice
clean
well
made
lager
with
a
twist
nice
to
try
but
for
me
lacks
that
wow
factor
overall
an
excellent
summer
beer
outclasses
many
summer
beers
excellent
feel
very
light
body
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
slightly
sweet
finish
but
as
i
said
before
very
well
balanced
and
incredibly
refreshing
instead
of
buying
a
sixpack
of
ufo
or
any
other
cheap
hefeweizen
for
that
summer
beer
vibe
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
leisure
time
and
youll
be
much
happier
drink
it
was
a
nice
little
beer
but
just
lagers
arent
for
me
as
ive
said
before
ill
keep
trying
bound
to
find
one
i
like
overall
i
graded
this
to
style
and
frankly
this
blows
away
most
of
the
beers
in
the
style
if
not
to
style
i
would
still
give
this
over
a
4
this
is
one
of
the
best
jacks
abbey
brews
floral
clean
and
complex
for
the
style
could
easily
throw
back
several
of
these
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
lager
for
summer
this
is
really
light
and
the
flavors
are
slightly
muted
but
what
flavors
there
are
work
well
nothing
too
revoluntionary
here
but
a
great
beer
for
the
season
o
this
is
a
super
tasty
and
super
refreshing
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
so
i
was
almost
scared
off
of
this
one
but
im
so
glad
i
tried
it
i
can
see
myself
reaching
for
this
one
on
a
hot
day
o
an
absolutely
awesome
beer
that
i
will
search
out
to
drink
again
i
must
say
while
taste
is
very
subjective
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
so
the
few
previous
reviews
that
rate
this
below
3
5
must
not
be
rating
to
style
yes
an
american
pale
lager
isnt
as
great
as
all
the
ipas
you
drink
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
damn
good
beer
500ml
bottle
with
summer
2012
on
the
side
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
aromas
of
grass
bread
and
orange
peel
spicy
the
taste
is
of
spices
with
orange
peel
grass
and
sweet
bread
lots
of
wheat
flavor
slightly
sour
certainly
tastes
and
drinks
like
a
summer
beer
its
nothing
special
not
much
going
on
here
overall
i
dont
need
to
have
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
brew
an
interesting
version
of
the
style
but
i
liked
this
smooth
is
an
understatement
exceptional
brewing
company
though
i
plan
to
keep
trying
their
beers
it
definitely
matches
a
american
pale
lager
its
just
awfully
boring
a
nice
wheat
lager
with
good
contributions
from
yeast
hops
and
malts
o
jacks
abby
is
some
kind
of
freak
abomination
of
a
brewery
how
do
they
make
these
beers
i
do
not
know
they
take
something
like
an
american
pale
lager
and
make
it
great
its
literally
ridiculous
at
this
point
this
beer
is
sort
of
an
american
twist
on
a
witbiersaison
combination
its
wheaty
spicy
and
oh
so
refreshing
great
balance
of
spices
just
makes
it
stellar
another
winner
from
jacks
abbey

becoming
one
of
my
fav
breweries
how
the
hell
did
these
guys
come
right
out
of
the
gate
at
full
speed
of
awesome
beers
and
just
lagering
o
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
from
jacks
abby
these
guys
make
so
many
spot
on
beers
and
this
beer
is
right
up
in
line
with
them
such
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
this
really
is
super
sessionable
too
just
gulpable
wonderfully
done
the
taste
has
some
fruitiness
but
the
tale
here
is
the
pleasant
hop
flavor
the
body
is
very
rich
with
a
low
carbonation
the
combination
is
superior
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
complexity
what
a
well
named
beer
its
not
a
true
weis
beer
at
all
but
it
has
just
enough
wheat
to
give
it
that
pale
sipping
weis
flavor
that
combined
with
the
tradional
light
type
lager
and
amazing
very
mild
spices
its
such
a
great
hot
summer
day
leisure
time
lager
the
spice
additions
are
really
what
make
this
beer
rock
though
if
it
was
just
a
wheatlager
itd
be
boring
those
little
spice
notes
are
the
cherry
on
top
actually
you
know
what
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
a
berliner
weis
but
instead
of
adding
syrup
it
was
steeped
with
a
very
mild
tea
of
chamomile
lemongrass
orange
coriander
and
a
very
mild
honeycomb
i
know
theres
none
in
it
but
damn
it
i
taste
honey
cool
beer
i
forgot
my
notes
but
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
5
all
the
way
the
best
pours
pitch
black
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
mild
strong
black
licorice
aroma
with
mild
cinnamonnutmeg
mildly
roasted
taste
with
black
licorice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
more
of
a
licorice
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
to
drink
overall
a
nice
festive
beer
that
is
a
bit
onedimensional
if
you
enjoy
christmas
beers
and
love
holiday
spices
then
this
will
be
really
enjoyable
if
you
want
complexity
then
this
may
not
be
for
you
pours
dark
brown
with
a
strong
aroma
of
allspice
toffee
it
tastes
of
chocolate
bready
caramel
with
a
finish
of
holiday
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
very
smooth
sipper
thats
not
too
over
the
top
perfect
way
to
cap
off
a
day
of
battling
against
black
bart
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
offering
it
looks
great
but
beyond
appearance
it
goes
downhill
after
that
spiced
amber
winter
warmer
nothing
too
special
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
fair
head
which
disappears
quickly
spotty
lacing
fall
spice
and
nuts
make
up
the
nose
bitter
and
spicy
cocoa
nibs
noted
on
the
label
are
barely
evident
in
the
nose
of
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
overall
i
prefer
the
copper
mug
tasting
just
dont
let
the
ale
get
too
warm
on
you
o
if
you
want
a
spiced
stout
tasting
beer
this
is
the
one
for
you
would
definitely
have
again
o
you
want
a
spiced
beer
here
you
go
if
you
dont
stay
away
this
resembles
what
most
of
us
think
of
as
beer
in
the
slimmest
of
ways
overall
not
bad
an
interesting
beer
overall
a
bit
too
much
on
the
spices
and
bitterness
especially
as
it
gets
tannic
salty
and
a
bit
astringent
on
the
finish
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
i
like
the
toasty
biscuit
brown
malts
sweet
flavors
ginger
bread
light
cocoa
etc
and
a
tasty
beer
overall
if
this
were
barrel
aged
it
would
go
to
a
whole
other
level
i
think
got
this
in
a
trade
with
icetrauma

hardly
any

after

overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
winter
warmer
style
great
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
spices
and
extremely
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
i
had
little
expectations
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
coming
out
of
the
glass
strong
flavors
and
very
complex
overall
a
good
first
experience
with
karbach
i
would
say
its
better
than
anything
big
beer
puts
out
but
there
are
so
many
great
holidayfallwinter
beers
out
there
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
this
dark
ale
is
brewed
and
sold
for
only
a
limited
time
so
consumers
need
to
seek
it
out
quickly
while
supplies
last
the
search
will
be
worthwhile
as
this
is
a
complex
and
warming
beer
that
makes
a
great
choice
for
a
cool
winter
day
if
you
like
winter
warmers
you
would
be
remiss
to
not
track
one
of
these
down
if
you
dont
and
the
issue
is
they
usually
are
too
spice
heavy
then
you
may
like
this
bad
boy
also
one
of
the
cooler
theme
i
have
seen
out
there
the
ba
version
fra
gee
lay
is
up
next
overall
i
wouldnt
seek
the
brew
but
id
have
one
if
offered
not
very
impressed
by
it
maybe
ill
watch
a
christmas
story
next
week
with
a
bottle
this
is
just
awesome
i
love
it
and
maybe
the
best
karback
has
to
offer
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
very
highly
recommended
is
a
good
winter
warmer
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
the
flavor
follows
suit
i
get
a
lot
of
cinnamon
and
caramel
malt
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
nutmeg
there
is
also
some
nice
raisin
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
other
dark
fruit
such
as
cherries
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
interesting
and
unique
not
bad
worth
a
try
pours
a
murky
honey
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spice
mint
herb
and
pickle
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
herb
and
pickle
juice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
herb
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
odd
but
interesting
mint
and
pickle
juice
qualities
that
i
wasnt
expecting
bought
a
bomber
from
windham
wine
spirits
in
willimantic
ct
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
bit
of
bubbly
foam
and
lots
of
carbonation
a
pleasant
enough
white
ale
with
definite
coriander
spice
in
the
swallow
that
flavor
lingers
on
a
bit
too
much
for
me
burning
my
throat
after
a
while
overall
it
is
definitely
an
interesting
spiced
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
be
jumping
at
the
gun
for
a
try
of
this
again
very
heavy
gold
lots
of
carbonation
white
head
coriander
and
pale
malt
not
as
fruit
forward
as
expected
clean
and
grainy
grass
and
yeast
some
really
pleasant
sourness
tart
and
soft
the
beer
has
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
spice
flavor
great
on
a
summer
day
o
a
refreshing
spicy
lager
that
was
better
than
expected
recommended
wow
this
brew
is
almost
flawless
there
is
absolutely
nothing
negative
to
say
about
this
beer
clear
faded
orange
glow
billowy
bright
white
head
that
fades
quickly
sweet
and
exotic
spice
upfront
corrinder
ginger
snap
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
rich
feeling
in
the
mouth
but
light
and
fluffy
sweet
pears
and
apples
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
tangerines
belgian
like
spice
tastes
vinous
like
a
chardonnay
finishes
clean
with
a
soft
underlying
bitterness
that
mellow
the
flavors
out
spice
and
ginger
linger
a
really
unique
brew
it
really
does
taste
like
a
belgian
blonde
was
brewed
with
over
the
tope
spices
and
lagered
clean
complex
fun
and
delicious
i
like
it
it
actually
smells
like
a
sauvigion
blanc
no
lie
faint
peppery
finish
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
and
super
unique
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
reminds
me
of
a
witte
but
not
getting
the
coriander
and
citrusy
hops
middle
of
the
road
is
best
i
can
do
on
this
bottle
might
try
again
to
confirm
the
findings
nicelooking
and
smooth
tasting
beer
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
depth
or
complexity
satisfying
but
light
could
use
some
more
spiciness
for
the
style
more
like
a
witbier
to
me
based
on
others
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
decent
brewery
albeit
not
necessarily
the
absolute
elite
o
meh
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
and
i
like
the
idea
of
a
spiced
lager
still
the
flavor
profile
was
so
narrow
that
i
cannot
get
excited
about
this
beer
overall
drinkability
would
be
a
very
very
good
beer
if
not
for
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
ale
or
a
wit
with
more
coriander
d
very
solid
beer
i
would
get
this
again
first
ive
had
from
coney
island
ill
be
delving
them
further
in
the
near
future
this
is
a
real
winner
here
cloudy
golden
liquid
with
a
very
big
white
head
and
a
good
slow
fade
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
and
a
thick
covering
on
top
active
carbonation
smell
is
full
of
spices
and
a
great
doughy
malt
some
zesty
orange
and
light
mellon
like
sweetness
along
with
a
ginger
and
corriander
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
combines
the
crispness
of
a
lager
with
the
broader
palate
of
an
ale
belgian
wit
to
be
specific
it
somehow
maintains
some
of
the
hallmark
lager
cleanness
while
delivering
a
bouquet
of
citrus
and
spice
along
with
a
dry
chalky
quinine
bitterness
finish
is
dry
and
orangey
with
spices
flavoring
a
light
malt
that
lingers
feel
is
wonderful
with
a
velvety
carbonation
and
light
medium
weight
crisp
and
quenching
this
beer
makes
for
a
perfect
beer
to
slake
the
springsummer
thirst
it
is
supremely
drinkable
and
while
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
in
abv
it
sessions
well
this
is
one
heck
of
brew
that
has
its
feet
well
planted
in
two
worlds
and
im
loving
it
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
i
didnt
think
it
was
anything
special
but
i
would
absolutely
give
it
another
try
highlight
for
me
was
the
flavor
full
of
spice
and
citrus
give
it
a
try
albino
python
isnt
necessarily
the
white
lager
it
claims
to
be
but
like
with
other
shmaltz
brewing
products
it
really
doesnt
matter
the
flavor
is
interesting
the
label
features
some
cool
artwork
and
the
taste
is
one
all
its
own
it
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
again
and
again
just
to
enjoy
the
intriguing
combinations
of
spices
and
malts
overall
a
pretty
damn
tasty
white
lager
that
had
a
nice
sweet
citrus
presence
making
it
quite
refreshing
and
giving
it
a
great
drinkability
cheers
lampertland
best
enjoyed
quickly
dont
sit
with
the
beer
in
the
mouth
trying
to
pick
apart
the
flavors
within
but
rather
swallow
tiny
sips
quickly
enjoying
it
as
a
whole
which
is
how
it
works
best
a
unique
freakish
sexy
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
coriander
with
some
orange
and
wheat
notes
thrown
in
i
also
get
some
mint
notes
but
i
am
not
sure
where
they
are
coming
from
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
what
you
expect
in
a
belgian
white
i
get
some
coriander
and
wheat
as
well
as
some
very
light
fruit
and
floral
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
smells
like
an
herb
garden
ginger
and
lemon
cut
through
immediately
but
followed
by
something
like
cloves
or
cardamom
pours
a
great
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
i
dont
find
it
overcarbonated
but
rather
really
refreshing
and
crisp
the
ginger
flavor
is
welcome
especially
when
paring
this
beer
with
food
gives
some
interesting
results
after
the
beer
warms
a
bit
i
think
the
flavors
are
even
more
pronounced
and
delicious
o
i
had
this
one
back
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
and
i
still
like
it
theres
something
to
be
said
for
that
all
in
all
comes
across
as
a
bizarre
lemon
ginger
belgianstyled
spicing
with
the
heavier
body
and
texture
of
a
german
hefeweizen
but
is
actually
a
heavilyspiced
white
lager
i
like
it
but
than
again
ive
always
been
drawn
to
unusual
beers
ymmv
my
nitpicks
are
that
the
vegetal
element
in
the
finish
doesnt
really
fit
in
all
that
well
and
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
that
i
would
be
receiving
something
akin
to
a
berliner
weiss
which
didnt
actually
happen
a
22
oz
bottle
from
back
of
the
cooler
at
boulevard
liquors
in
san
diego
crazy
stuff
overall
easy
beer
to
drink
for
a
lager
i
like
this
one
wont
be
on
my
list
of
beers
to
buy
since
i
usually
search
more
for
ipas
and
stouts
but
if
you
like
lagers
definitely
find
this
one
you
will
not
be
disappointing
i
was
expecting
a
lot
less
although
this
isnt
an
amazing
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
the
purchase
this
poured
a
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
nice
amount
of
foam
some
sweet
gently
pleasing
hop
aromas
come
through
tastes
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
spiciness
on
the
finish
the
surprise
treat
is
the
ginger
that
comes
through
as
it
warmsbarely
noticeable
at
first
after
the
better
part
of
an
hour
it
goes
from
background
player
to
center
stage
delicious
mild
carbonation
and
the
smooth
malty
flavor
make
this
beer
feel
creamy
and
slightly
thick
the
taste
is
very
fresh
and
clean
making
this
a
vey
drinkable
beer
excellent
brew
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
o
alright
i
was
excited
about
this
beer
and
i
feel
let
down
the
smell
and
flavors
are
there
but
its
lacking
something
o
cant
think
of
anything
constructive
to
say
about
this
beer
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
overalli
like
the
idea
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
lots
of
flavor
packed
in
here
but
maybe
they
could
balance
some
of
this
out
it
didnt
really
impress
me
but
the
bottle
sure
was
cool
looking
too
much
ginger
no
matter
what
style
you
decide
to
call
it
i
recommend
this
beer
without
any
reservations
and
as
a
bonus
the
6
abv
is
low
enough
to
let
you
enjoy
more
than
one
hazy
pale
bright
golden
blonde
colour
one
finger
of
dense
white
head
with
some
lace
smell
is
malty
and
spicy
orange
coriander
some
ginger
but
bready
malt
is
the
most
reoccurring
scent
here
taste
is
full
of
ginger
sharp
spicy
notes
lots
of
malts
and
as
it
warmed
some
earthy
root
like
flavours
high
active
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
solid
weight
this
was
quite
unique
similar
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
a
wit
but
is
missing
something
probably
because
its
a
spiced
lager
that
said
i
like
this
better
than
macro
witbiers
like
shock
top
and
rickards
white
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
overwhelming
either
not
terrible
but
dont
think
ill
be
back
for
more
overall
tastes
like
a
soapy
ginger
wit
interesting
but
not
too
appealing
to
me
overall
im
not
really
digging
this
beer
the
ginger
is
overwhelming
and
i
want
more
yeast
character
i
could
see
them
doing
a
wit
with
the
exact
same
ingredients
minus
the
ginger
and
it
would
be
a
damn
good
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
well
carbonated
head
with
clingy
lacingthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
spiceslemon
peelcitruscandied
wheat
and
finished
with
a
herbal
hoppy
dryness
and
overall
an
above
average
white
thats
easy
enough
to
knock
back
cheers
overall
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
spices
really
stand
out
but
are
well
balanced
by
the
lemon
and
malts
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
like
how
shmaltz
takes
traditional
ale
recipes
and
brews
in
a
lager
style
its
unique
and
in
this
case
very
delicious
in
the
end
the
ginger
spice
is
the
only
thing
that
lingers
and
it
does
so
for
a
while
i
think
some
more
hops
and
their
bitterness
could
have
made
the
beer
a
little
more
balanced
but
still
theres
a
still
i
recommend
this
beer
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
glad
i
chose
this
on
tap
at
amity
hall
in
the
village
in
nyc
o
decent
herbal
brew
like
a
mild
spiced
belgian
white
or
pale
as
promised
this
beer
is
weird
but
good
o
this
is
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
easy
drinking
clean
and
great
for
warm
weather
it
tastes
strange
at
first
but
the
flavors
grew
on
me
very
quickly
schmaltz
is
quickly
making
me
respect
lagers
a
whole
lot
more
with
their
coney
island
line
of
beers
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
very
interesting
to
try
a
spiced
lager
rather
than
just
a
spiced
ale
would
like
to
have
this
again
doverall
this
was
a
interesting
beer
had
interesting
flavors
and
super
drinkable
i
actually
kind
of
liked
it
i
would
say
this
is
a
must
try
once
o
overall
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
a
lack
of
robust
character
even
for
a
light
lager
o
this
is
definitely
an
unusual
kind
of
beer
but
is
oddly
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
it
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
more
of
a
beer
to
experiment
with
and
sample
than
to
pound
or
session
with
its
worth
a
try
for
adventurous
beer
drinkers
o
the
taste
is
quite
unique
and
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
but
this
is
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
however
it
might
provide
for
some
interesting
pairings
with
italian
food
overall
im
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
i
think
it
scored
a
b
overall
i
try
not
to
look
so
as
to
keep
independent
but
i
cant
avoid
it
sometimes
but
i
think
it
deserves
better
and
since
my
average
score
is
about
a
c
thats
saying
something
thin
yellow
and
mellow
in
appearance
with
thin
head
that
lasts
only
a
moment
small
hint
of
spice
at
first
taste
with
a
lingering
sense
of
fruit
but
none
of
the
flavors
last
very
long
refreshing
but
not
memorable
its
light
and
i
get
the
sense
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
overall
not
great
spices
are
way
too
overpowering
for
what
it
is
no
malt
or
pumpkin
or
sweetness
or
something
heavier
to
balance
the
heavy
spices
pours
a
clear
peachgolden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
ends
with
a
ringy
collar
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
light
wheat
and
bread
and
also
a
bit
of
odd
spice
that
doesnt
really
fit
seems
like
white
pepper
the
flavor
carries
some
more
of
this
character
white
pepper
and
some
other
spice
very
strange
bread
and
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
body
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
very
strange
beer
not
a
big
fan
appearance
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
thin
dissapating
head
smell
of
a
light
clean
lager
with
spice
and
lemon
taste
of
ginger
is
dominant
with
a
little
lemon
thrown
in
but
light
and
subtle
enough
to
make
for
a
refreshing
lager
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
in
the
end
with
little
hop
lingering
but
still
enjoyable
taste
like
bud
light
lime
on
steroids
if
you
like
the
taste
of
lime
in
your
beer
you
should
definelty
try
this
otherwise
i
would
stay
away
it
had
a
lighter
flavor
and
would
have
a
very
drinkable
quality
if
not
for
the
lime
and
i
actually
think
it
could
have
been
a
decent
tasting
beer
if
they
could
dial
back
the
limelike
flavor
quite
a
bit
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
read
white
lager
brewed
with
spices
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
to
be
a
good
one
either
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
a
lower
abv
bomber
and
is
will
to
try
a
really
different
light
beer
o
the
ginger
twist
is
a
lovely
addition
and
really
makes
this
stand
out
d
with
a
host
of
surprisingly
intense
flavors
this
beer
comes
across
as
interesting
if
a
little
amateurish
in
the
way
it
is
put
together
still
it
is
a
fairly
unique
creation
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
easy
comparison

go

i

the

could
have
done
a

the

i
would
pass
on
having
another

an

followed
by
something
like

pours
a
great
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no

i
dont
find
it
overcarbonated
but
rather
really
refreshing
and
crisp
the
ginger
flavor
is
welcome
especially
when
paring
this
beer
with
food
gives
some
interesting
results
after
the
beer
warms
a
bit
i
think
the
flavors
are
even
more
pronounced
and
delicious
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
well
worth
it
after
having
given
a
pint
of
blood
a
few
hours
earlier
i
have
to
admit
that
i
had
trepidations
in
trying
this
beer
because
well
the
brewery
is
called
schmaltz
and
theyre
labels
are
gimmicky
i
try
not
to
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
but
in
this
case
it
would
have
worked
to
my
favor
luckily
i
didnt
pay
for
this
one
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
different
and
i
sure
got
it
they
advertized
it
as
a
white
lager
brewed
with
spices
and
i
think
they
got
a
little
carried
away
with
the
spice
aspect
when
i
drink
it
i
have
to
remind
myself
im
drinking
a
beer
because
the
flavors
make
me
forget
not
recommended
unlike
saison
du
buff
which
somehow
manages
to
make
an
herbforward
beer
that
pleases
the
spices
here
and
perhaps
thats
the
key
foil
this
beer
d
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
very
wellsuited
for
hot
weather
consumption

i
didnt

what
to

those
freaks
in

sure
are
creative
it
has
a
very
light
and
sweet
smell
with
some
fruity
hop
esters
its
appearance
is
a
light
gold

with
a
thick

the
body
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
full
of
spice
and
citrus
i
love
the
spiciness
but
think
it
maybe
a
little
overdone
on
the
citrus
for
my
tastes
but
not
by
much
it
has
a
great
light
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
its
different
thats
for
sure
there
were
aspects
i
really
enjoyed
flavor
and
aroma
but
the
feel
itself
didnt
sit
right
i
think
if
this
was
readily
available
id
have
it
again

not

d
a

with
elements
of
a

weisse
lager
and
ginger
beer
very
interesting
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
just
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
ginger
for
my
taste
this
beer
is
a
clown
a
goon
a
freak
in
a
fucking
sideshow
we
were
listening
to
slapshots
old

hardcore
while
drinking
this
we
dig
it

theres
no

why
the
world
shouldnt
be
drinking
this
for
breakfast
alongside
your
eggs
bacon

pretty
good
beer
very
drinkable
and

typical
for
shmaltz

was

this
one
surprised
me
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
when
i
saw
it
at
my
local
liquor
store
it
seemed
a
bit
gimmicky
to
mea
white
lager
called
the
albino
python
and
yet
im
glad
my
curiosity
convinced
me
to
pick
it
up
not
particularly
bizarre
or
exotic
actually
and
in
fact
it
tasted
much
as
you
would
expect
a
witbier
lager
hybrid
if
that
makes
sense
cloudy
wheat
appearance
with
almost
no
head
definitely
enjoyed
the
spices
that
dominate
this
brew
consumed
by
the
typical
orangecoriander
witbier
ingredients
but
also
by
the
ginger
that
is
added
to
this
unique
beer
if
you
enjoy
spiced
beer
i
see
no
reason
why
not
to
love
this
one
the
6
is
slightly
above
your
average
witbier
and
yet
not
particularly
noticeable
i
also
found
that
the
spices
become
even
richer
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bit
i
enjoyed
all
22
oz
of
this
and
ill
probably
come
back
to
it
now
and
then
if
it
continues
to
be
available
props
to
shmaltz
who
always
seem
to
be
cooking
up
adventurous
brews
that
usually
seem
to
work
pretty
welli
quite
liked
this
white
lager
overall
this
beer
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
flavors
werent
smooth
enough
to
make
it
above
average
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
especially
in
the
warmer
months
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
high
smooth
and
well
balanced
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
poured
a
hazy
golden
straw
yellow
with
orange
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticky
to
the
glass
right
away
i
did
get
wheat
bready
malt
aromas
with
spices
that
consisted
of
coriander
slight
cinnamon
and
faint
citrus
notes
upfront
on
the
taste
the
spices
were
a
little
bolder
which
were
coriander
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
also
had
some
nice
citrus
accents
that
had
a
nice
wheat
malt
balance
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
had
a
spicey
slight
citric
and
malty
finish
overall
was
a
decent
beer
which
drank
pretty
good
and
was
not
overwhelming
on
the
spice
tastes
ginger
odd
wheat
lemony
soapy
and
herbal
thyme
and
marjoram
licorice
and
mildly
of
oranges
ah
there
is
a
flavor
i
find
in
pepperoni
not
the
meat
or
salt
but
an
herbal
character
the
herb
components
of
this
beer
totally
dominate
a
sort
of
heaviness
over
the
malt
and
what
should
be
refreshing
coriander
and
orange
there
is
a
peppery
zip
that
tries
to
show
but
loses
to
the
earthiness
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
the
orange
shows
pretty
strong
here
light
body
and
strong
fine
carbonation
as
much
as
id
like
to
say
i
hate
it
it
is
very
complex
in
an
odd
and
slightly
intriguing
way
i
cant
imagine
buying
this
beer
in
the
future
but
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
picked
up
at
wilburs
in
fort
collins
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
pours
a
dark
urine
color
that
is
seriously
carbonnated
with
bubbles
dancing
throughout
although
it
quickly
settles
into
an
almost
flat
beer
not
much
nose
just
a
little
subtle
spice
heavy
gingercardamomcoriander
flavors
on
the
palate
lead
to
a
lingering
bitter
finish
not
that
good
d
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
drink
i
couldnt
toss
back
6
of
them
but
theyre
quite
tasty
and
would
be
nice
complement
to
any
beer
tasting
evening
the
spices
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
making
for
a
delicious
balanced
beverage
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
unique
white
ale
that
is
pretty
refreshing
i
kind
of
like
the
ginger
note
pretty
good
stuff
d
quite
drinkable
id
definitely
have
another
one
after
this
maybe
a
bit
simple
but
very
refreshing
a
white
lager
interesting
pours
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
no
head
to
this
one
taste
is
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
lemoncitrus
sort
of
taste
to
it
finishes
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
funky
citrusy
sort
of
after
taste
i
would
have
rather
had
this
just
be
a
white
ale
instead
of
this
new
hybrid
drinkable
but
seems
like
an
odd
concoction
and
certainly
tastes
like
one
ill
pass
got
this
from
my
botm
shipment
golden
in
color
it
has
a
hazy
or
cloudy
look
to
it
the
bubbly
white
head
shows
up
but
fizzes
away
quickly
strong
citrus
notes
im
mostly
picking
up
lemon
kind
of
grassy
notes
as
well
an
acidy
bite
to
it
at
first
definitely
citrus
as
the
main
attraction
i
get
the
feeling
of
spices
but
am
not
advanced
enough
to
pick
any
out
specifically
a
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
upfront
but
it
seemed
to
lose
some
carbonation
as
i
got
further
along
and
seemed
borderline
flat
at
the
end
like
i
feel
about
a
lot
of
beers
i
think
this
beer
could
hit
the
spot
at
the
right
moment
such
as
after
a
hot
day
on
the
golf
course
where
something
thirst
quenching
would
fit
the
bill
probably
wont
pick
this
one
out
again
but
will
try
some
others
from
shmaltz
for
sure
d
easy
to
drink
id
have
one
every
once
and
a
while
but
probably
not
more
part
of
a
recent
arrival
from
botmc
never
been
to
coney
island
but
hey
ive
had
a
coney
dog
lets
give
the
brew
a
whirl
popping
the
menacing
top
yields
a
smell
of
orange
and
allspice
with
more
citrus
pours
into
a
stemless
red
wine
glass
with
a
nice
cloudy
yelow
orange
with
a
very
thin
head
taste
is
almost
like
a
belgian
wit
beer
with
a
serious
carbonation
bite
evident
in
the
taste
is
the
spicing
some
good
dry
bitterness
that
has
a
bite
but
not
a
chomp
and
a
slight
citrus
fruitiness
throughout
great
thirst
quenching
brew
nice
bitterness
very
light
and
refreshing
with
no
sacrifice
to
flavor
i
like
it
i
liked
this
beer
for
its
mild
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
fancy
whites
but
a
nice
drinkable
beer
with
citrus
flavor
dominating
but
not
overpowering
not
bad
overall
some
surprises
some
good
some
notsogreat
made
for
an
interesting
brew
with
some
stuff
id
only
rarely
tasted
before
id
have
it
again
but
theres
no
rush
right
away
d
very
refreshing
could
enjoy
this
at
a
hot
outside
bbq
or
after
yard
work
think
this
beer
is
just
out
of
style
but
it
does
not
hurt
the
drinkability
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
hef
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
imo
the
smell
was
weak
and
tepid
there
is
just
the
faintest
hint
of
spice
the
flavor
is
off
slightly
spicey
up
front
and
it
finishes
spicey
it
does
have
a
lemon
like
sweetness
to
it
the
brew
is
light
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
this
one
did
not
work
for
me
imo
it
tasted
very
little
like
a
wit
and
it
really
didnt
tast
like
a
lager
they
kinda
missed
on
all
counts
notes
this
beer
just
has
an
interesting
flavor
to
me
and
good
balance
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
par
with
lamb
or
pasta
with
italian
sausage
in
the
sauce
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
without
doubt
im
curious
to
what
they
used
making
it
an
overall
solid
beer
that
i
enjoyed
every
sip
of
for
6
bucks
and
an
abv
of
6
its
more
than
a
good
buy
i
cant
wait
to
check
out
the
rest
of
what
shmaltz
has
to
offer
with
their
coney
island
lagers
not
really
to
style
at
all
but
thats
not
shmaltzs
fault
a
standup
fruity
spicy
lager
and
one
that
doesnt
do
you
in
after
a
couple
glasses
d
it
was
a
good
beer
did
something
a
little
different
to
get
some
more
flavor
into
it
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
22
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
with
pale
acidulated
and
carapils
malt
torrified
wheat
and
flaked
oats
hopped
with
warrior
saaz
and
summit
and
spiced
with
ginger
fennel
and
sweet
orange
zest
the
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
orangey
white
with
moderate
carbonation
a
few
floaties
and
no
real
lacing
it
has
a
unique
and
spicy
aroma
that
is
dominated
by
orange
but
ginger
and
a
bit
of
hops
show
up
as
well
a
clean
yeast
lets
all
of
the
flavors
come
through
starting
with
orange
but
moving
to
the
ginger
and
fennel
wheat
a
definite
sour
note
and
lightly
bitter
citrusy
hops
on
top
of
a
light
tingly
almost
creamy
body
that
has
a
very
dry
finish
quite
the
interesting
brew
wellworth
a
try
on
its
own
but
this
would
go
much
better
with
food
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
brewed
with
ginger
my
first
was
the
hitachino
nest
long
before
i
started
reviewing
which
i
found
unpalatably
sour
remembering
that
past
experience
with
ginger
beer
i
was
a
little
hesitant
coming
into
this
one
i
was
really
surprised
though
this
one
won
me
over
overall
im
disappointed
i
do
not
mind
aggressive
spice
however
it
is
not
blended
well
the
spice
mess
with
the
fruity
taste
that
could
shine
and
the
finish
is
not
pleasant
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
thought
from
the
name
it
may
be
a
witbier
it
labels
itself
as
a
spiceherb
beer
but
i
just
tasted
what
seemed
to
resemble
an
offshoot
from
a
bmc
a
lot
of
grain
little
aroma
or
taste
and
a
short
nonmemorable
finish
cute
label
though
d
its
not
for
me
definitely
the
worst
offering
ive
had
from
shmaltz
this
was
part
of
my
beer
of
the
month
ive
got
2
more
of
them
sigh
its
interesting
and
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
mediumlight
bodied
gently
crisp
and
zesty
with
spice
its
unique
and
probably
the
best
balanced
beer
from
shmaltz
worth
trying
not
pretty
to
look
at
but
it
works
a
tasty
flavoured
lager
that
delivers
and
offers
something
different
id
go
back
for
more
good
drinkability
tasty
but
backed
by
unusual
spices
that
might
take
some
time
getting
used
to
out
of
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
and
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazed
golden
straw
yellow
color
with
a
good
two
inches
of
bubbly
bone
white
head
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
citrus
such
as
lemon
ginger
toasted
biscuits
sweet
caramel
malt
somewhat
spicy
medium
in
body
no
noticeable
alcohol
burn
and
amply
carbonated
drinkability
a
really
interesting
experiment
but
i
cannot
say
that
i
was
seduced
by
this
serpent
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hops
slight
sour
hint
of
wheat
hint
of
coriander
and
a
hint
of
all
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
herbed
spiced
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
s
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
wheat
hint
of
pale
malt
slight
all
spice
slight
coriander
hint
of
grass
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
weak
appearance
decent
aroma
but
good
blend
and
body
d
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
of
these
if
you
paid
me
just
some
quick
notes
i
enjoyed
the
ginger
flavor
and
addition
of
crushed
fennel
in
this
beer
i
noticed
some
other
bas
had
some
problems
with
this
beer
being
flat
perhaps
they
are
overcompensating
now
because
my
bottle
was
almost
overcarbed
the
flavor
of
ginger
and
fennel
in
beer
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
but
again
i
thought
it
be
a
unique
flavor
that
works
in
a
light
blond
and
nearly
effervescent
beer
one
more
point
even
though
this
is
a
lager
it
shouldnt
be
served
to
cold
as
the
doing
so
muted
the
fruitier
flavor
of
the
ginger
and
sweet
orange
peel
pours
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
thick
white
head
with
a
few
dollops
here
and
there
nose
is
light
and
with
the
coriander
it
suggest
something
more
familiar
such
as
a
belgian
wheat
on
the
palate
the
impressions
of
an
ale
rather
than
a
lager
are
seen
perhaps
its
just
the
association
with
these
spices
to
another
style
but
it
is
rather
soft
with
some
gentle
fruit
in
there
again
an
ale
on
tap
at
a
local
beer
festival
whiteyellow
color
and
a
thin
white
head
smell
was
alluring
spicy
and
citrusy
fruit
and
ginger
flooded
the
mouth
with
an
onslaught
of
coriander
and
sharp
tangy
citrusy
flavors
that
were
just
not
meant
to
go
together
let
alone
go
together
in
beer
hops
flooded
in
too
and
far
too
sharp
and
subtle
to
flush
out
the
poor
taste
watery
in
the
mouth
and
dry
and
awful
on
the
back
end
it
was
at
best
a
really
badlyconcocted
spice
beer
with
a
witbierwannabe
body
and
without
the
smoothness
or
any
taste
not
sure
exactly
what
to
think
about
this
one
it
smelled
nice
as
it
came
out
of
the
bottle
but
smelled
a
little
stale
when
you
smelled
it
out
of
the
glass
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
brown
by
far
the
best
quality
of
the
beer
it
tasted
wheaty
slightly
spiced
and
flat
it
leaves
a
flat
taste
in
the
mouth
as
the
taste
sticks
in
the
mouth
aftertaste
doesnt
stick
around
that
long
and
the
beer
goes
down
fairly
easily
this
might
fit
some
peoples
taste
but
i
didnt
enkoy
it
md
the
extreme
spiciness
makes
this
hard
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color

the
spot
on
a
hot
day
d
a
very
different
beer
in
comparison
to
my
usual
but
shockingly
its
very
drinkable
im
not
saying
you
could
go
out
and
drink
a
keg
of
this
but
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
a
couple
glasses
rather
quickly
overall
this
is
certainly
something
different
and
ill
give
them
props
for
being
fairly
interesting
and
different
but
i
cant
see
myself
revisiting
this
one
this
one
is
definitely
heavily
spiced
and
anyone
who
cannot
handle
a
beer
that
falls
into
that
category
should
stay
away
however
i
thought
the
spices
worked
well
together
and
created
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
that
is
definitely
interesting
the

uninitiated

alittle
on
the
weak
side
with

sweet

the
taste
is
really
not
that
great
a
nice
lemon
wheat
summer
beer
with
a
bunch
of
spices
hold
the
spices
and
this
would
be
goodbut
the
strong
ginger
flavor
doesnt
make
it
with
me
the
mf
is
light
with
the
strange
mixture
of
flavors
not
really
coming
together
a
strange
beer
not
horriblebut
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
lot
worse
than
it
was
actually
decent
for
its
price
have
not
had
many
heavily
spiced
lagers
but
this
seemed
to
work
fairly
well
might
drink
again
at
that
price
probably
worth
trying
overkill
in
the
spice
department
otherwise
pretty
good
this
had
a
nice
malt
taste
that
blended
nicely
with
wheat
and
some
fruitiness
to
it
just
like
the
look
it
was
well
carbonated
refreshing
beer
i
really
wish
theyd
expand
the
hebrew
line
instead
of
this
coney
island
junk
hmmm
im
going
to
say
this
must
have
ginger
in
it
citrus
peel
hop
flavors
with
a
very
light
malt
profile
really
lets
the
spices
do
their
thing
not
sure
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
in
this
case
unique
fo
sho
i
might
try
this
again
sometime
tastes
like
it
might
be
tasty
on
draft
a
white
lager
beerhmm
somethin
different
poured
into
a
pilsner
all
head
and
foam
even
with
a
gentle
pourit
took
forver
to
finally
come
down
to
pour
more
after
a
long
wait
a
lemony
yellow
color
emerged
with
a
spritzylike
look
to
it
aromas
were
a
little
faint
just
some
toasted
grain
and
mineral
with
a
hint
of
ginger
at
the
beginning
the
flavors
are
light
and
toasty
and
pretty
pleasent
even
a
hint
of
lemon
comes
thru
but
man
that
finish
is
a
little
harshbig
ginger
and
fennel
hit
hard
and
kinda
ruins
the
beer
and
its
drinkibility
this
beer
is
off
kilter
in
a
bad
wayiam
not
sure
how
old
it
is
and
its
from
a
brewery
that
i
respectvery
odd
overall
too
much
ginger
maybe
a
spice
beer
for
my
liking
but
still
drinkable
tyhe
taste
is
a
but
unusual
but
with
wheatale
or
witbier
elements
it
tastes
mostly
of
pear
and
squirt
soda
pop
mixed
lemongrapefruit
soda
pop
flavour
with
the
squirt
taking
over
more
but
a
bit
more
bitter
it
ends
up
being
quite
grapefruti
but
more
in
a
bitter
version
of
squirt
than
the
usual
grapefruit
character
i
normally
encounter
its
also
otherwise
lacking
and
its
pretty
onedimensional
i
surprisingly
dug
this
one
i
say
surprisingly
because
it
was
chilled
quite
a
bit
coming
out
of
the
fridge
and
the
first
few
sips
were
fairly
run
of
the
mill
and
unimpressive
with
not
much
aroma
or
flavour
at
all
coming
through
once
it
warmed
up
that
all
changed
and
a
ton
of
stuff
came
popping
out
of
this
one
so
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
bit
before
enjoying
itll
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
a
nice
second
offering
from
me
after
being
let
down
by
the
blockhead
this
one
works
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
and
uniquely
flavored
wheat
ale

d
albino
python
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
theres
not
much
there
beyond
the
two
most
prominent
spices
the
utter
palate
smack
of
ginger
and
fennel
sip
after
sip
is
making
this
bomber
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
get
there
shmaltz
is
on
to
something
here
though
i
just
wish
they
couldve
deepened
the
malt
character
on
this
beer
so
there
would
something
for
the
spices
to
play
off
of
d
sweet
fruity
and
interesting
would
be
nice
for
a
spring
evening
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
blown
away
dvery
drinkable
highest
points
next
to
taste
i
just
wish
it
had
some
heft
and
staying
power
but
then
the
alcohol
level
takes
care
of
that
its
a
recommended
brew
on
most
counts
i
could
slam
through
quite
of
few
of
these
before
i
realized
the
consequences
but
all
in
all
its
not
a
challenging
thoughtprovoking
brew
nice
spicebill
for
sure
at
least
the
proceeds
i
believe
go
to
an
effort
to
save
pop
culture
icons
like
coney
island
d
unique
for
the
style
as
they
definitley
unleashed
the
spice
rack
frankly
its
drinkability
dimished
as
i
tired
of
the
spices
drinkability
this
is
a
very
pleasant
wheat
ale
i
love
the
sweetness
that
goes
along
with
the
wheat
if
the
abv
was
not
as
high
i
could
session
this
22oz
bottle
poured
quite
clean
golden
some
sediment
large
white
foamy
head
floral
aromas
some
hop
mild
spice
of
some
sort
kind
of
pale
kind
of
white
ale
flavors
of
citrus
with
a
small
almount
of
sweetness
malt
and
sugar
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
spices
coriander
and
ginger
maybe
but
rather
nondescript
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
light
bodied
but
filling
from
the
carbonation
seemed
drinkable
until
i
realized
i
still
had
half
of
it
left
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
overall
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
scmaltz
but
i
wouldnt
dissuade
anyone
from
trying
itas
is
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
overall
a
miss
for
me
due
to
the
ginger
ale
aspect
but
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
beer
if
you
do
like
ginger
ale
one
and
done
can
only
recommend
if
you
love
ginger
ale
if
not
avoid
and
try
one
of
their
other
beers
one
thing
i
did
like
is
that
they
say
the
proceeds
from
this
series
are
going
to
support
the
real
coney
island
which
is
cool
overall
im
quite
surprised
the
bottle
lists
it
as
a
white
lager
not
the
best
representation
of
style

clove
flavors
this
beer
tastes
like
a
wheat
ale
supercharged
wth
a
lot
of
anise
a
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
the
sediment
adds
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
the
palate
is
tart
when
filtered
not
unpleasant
at
all
which
went
along
perfectly
with
the

python
shown
on
the
label
the
carbonation
was
huge
nevertheless

but
there
were
so
many
choices
that
day
cloudy
like
champagne
maybe
a
little
too
gassy
i
started
to
feel
a
little
bloated
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
certainly
unique
perfect
for
summer
the
label
is
also
quite
appealing
but
dont
get
fooled
an
interesting
twist
on
a
witbier
as
it
is
a
lager
this
is
a
better
version
of
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
this
was
an
excellent
beer
not
your
typical
vanilla
porter
the
cinnamon
really
adds
a
great
flavor
to
it
obviously
it
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
but
its
really
good
just
on
its
own
as
well
seek
this
one
out
if
you
want
a
little
something
different
ill
look
for
this
one
again
for
sure
let
me
start
by
saying
i
got
this
beer
after
failing
to
get
my
hands
on
xocoveza
after
saying
that
im
glad
i
didnt
find
it
and
got
this
its

great
taste
amazing
feels

i
give
it

a

dark

incredibly

my
preferred
all

beer
tasting
glass
tasted
july
2014
a
big
ol
bottle
that
pours
black
as
midnight
with
a
creamy
slight
tan
head
smell
is
vanilla
cream
cinnamon
and
the
local
starbucks
taste
is
cinnamon
burnt
biscuits
some
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
cream
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
this
review
seems
to
be
holding
the
record
for
use
of
the
word
cream
not
including
that
one
even
overall
its
interesting
a
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
flavors
for
me
but
probably
this
not
being
my
favorite
style
is
affecting
my
judgement
if
you
like
the
style
give
it
a
shot
if
you
dont
well
you
probably
wouldnt
have
anyway
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
looking
forward
to
next
years
version
the
cinnamon
is
not
overly
powerful
but
this
does
taste
more
like
cookies
than
beer
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
an
ok
imperial
porter
a
big
sweetness
from
the
vanilla
but
not
much
else
no
bad
but
just
kind
of
flat
overall
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
dark
black
decent
head
looks
like
a
tasty
porter
aroma
was
cinnamon
and
malt
flavor
was
as
advertised
cinnamon
vanilla
malt
hint
if
chocolate
on
the
face
of
it
it
sounds
awesome
but
it
was
really
just
ok
glad
i
did
not
purchase
a
bottle
of
this
decent
enough
but
another
beer
thats
remarkably
unremarkable
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
dozens
of
other
decent
porters
on
the
market
o
as
a
porter
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
a
relatively
light
body
but
the
interesting
flavors
almost
make
this
a
beer
that
you
can
pleasantly
sip
the
horchata
porter
lacked
the
reason
i
bought
the
beer
the
horchata
vanilla
and
cinnamon
flavors
were
very
light
and
almost
unnoticeable
the
porter
itself
was
decent
although
a
bit
bitter
the
8
2
was
smooth
though
with
no
signs
of
abv
o
really
nice
porter
wish
there
was
a
little
more
cinnamon
to
spice
this
up
its
barely
discernible
sweet
and
creamy
regardless
nice
flavors
that
meld
together
well
definitely
a
sweet
beer
as
youd
expect
for
the
style
solid
overall
for
sure
glad
i
got
to
try
it
bottle
01754
something
about
watching
iron
chef
and
drinking
a
horchatainspired
beer
just
makes
sense
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
light
molasses
buttercream
very
light
cocoa
and
the
lightest
possible
kiss
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vein
of
straight
vanilla
bean
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
thin
feel
overall
what
is
generally
a
tasty
brew
is
sabotaged
by
its
fartoothin
feel
vdubb86
and
i
agreed
that
if
it
had
more
heft
more
physical
substance
more
chewiness
it
would
be
an
exceptional
beer
we
just
wanted
the
flavors
to
hang
around
for
a
while
rather
than
book
it
like
lubed
jelly
this
is
everything
stones
vertical
epic
series
wished
it
could
be
all
wrapped
up
into
a
single
brew
yeah
i
said
it
a
huge
porter
dressed
up
with
cinnamon
and
vanilla
it
really
is
a
thing
of
beauty
pours
an
intriguing
dark
brown
with
an
obsidian
luster
and
a
noted
density
the
head
is
mocha
in
color
and
quite
fluffy
leaving
sticky
rings
as
it
drinks
the
nose
is
big
surprise
whole
vanilla
beans
and
cinnamon
sticks
in
equal
proportion
take
front
and
center
with
a
massive
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
body
behind
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
detectable
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
the
nose
but
the
prime
position
of
the
additives
is
welcomed
yet
again
the
vanilla
is
sweet
and
earthy
almost
greasy
in
its
contribution
and
the
cinnamon
is
intensely
spicy
in
flavor
and
fragrance
the
bitter
cocoa
character
of
the
malt
calms
both
down
and
unites
them
exquisitely
the
alcohol
only
comes
out
when
the
beer
warms
and
even
then
only
in
the
very
late
stages
of
the
otherwise
sweet
and
mellow
finish
wow
this
is
lovely
full
body
relaxed
but
noticeable
carbonation
and
a
mouth
coating
thoroughness
to
the
mouthfeel
overall
maybe
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
elevation
in
terms
of
both
creativity
and
execution
i
hope
this
gets
some
recognition
truly
one
of
a
kind
excellence
pours
black
with
a
nice
off
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
lightly
roasty
vanilla
beans
some
milk
chocolate
lactose
sugars
and
a
kiss
of
cinnamon
flavor
pretty
much
followed
suit
a
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
another
solid
brew
from
elevation
they
continue
to
impress
me
with
what
they
are
capable
with
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
from
them
and
it
kinda
pales
in
comparison
to
their
regular
porter
imo
little
mo
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
what
i
was
drinking
as
i
drank
it
othis
is
an
enjoyable
porter
there
is
nothing
mindblowing
here
but
some
good
flavors
nonetheless
if
you
like
your
dark
beers
on
the
sweet
and
mild
side
instead
of
the
smoke
and
char
side
senorita
is
a
good
option
pair
this
with
some
dulce
de
leche
or
flan
or
just
drink
it
alone
it
is
sweet
enough
and
desert
is
served
big
head
and
lace
remains
aroma
of
dried
out
brownie
rich
chocolate
flavors
dark
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
stand
out
very
nice
too
thin
and
missing
complexity
for
high
ranks
its
nice
and
drinkable
however
relatively
unremarkable
nice
blend
of
flavors
nothing
is
over
powering
barely
recommended
14
should
have
been
better
but
oh
well
just
an
attempt
by
then
to
make
a
craft
brew
this
is
a
very
delicious
but
not
overly
filling
beer
it
tastes
just
like
cocoa
puffs
im
not
really
sure
what
the
difference
is
being
shockolate
wheat
and
chocolate
wheat
pretty
sure
theyre
the
same
beer
with
a
different
label
since
im
having
trouble
finding
much
difference
now
that
ive
finished
shockolate
same
score
between
the
two
too
how
bout
that
one
of
my
favorite
beers
my
alltime
favorite
flavored
beer
for
sure
the
chocolate
flavor
overwhelmed
everything
else
making
it
almost
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
chocolate
milk
and
i
like
beer
it
is
very
hard
to
review
this
as
a
beer
as
it
tastes
much
more
like
a
chocolate
soda
too
sweet
for
my
taste
who
poured
beer
in
my
yoohoo
interesting
not
what
i
expected
different
but
not
unpleasant
tastes
ok
just
too
sweet
great
tasting
beer
that
is
good
for
a
winter
treat
not
nearly
as
bad
as
most
would
think
scoff
if
you
must
but
heres
the
real
skinny
from
my
perspective
on
this
first
off
the
pour
was
average
at
least
with
a
very
nice
color
to
both
the
beer
and
the
head
opaque
and
black
with
brown
tinges
head
slightly
off
white
but
the
head
does
dissipate
rather
quickly
leaving
some
not
a
lot
but
some
lacing
nose
was
full
of
chocolate
more
than
anything
else
not
an
overbearing
fragrance
but
not
any
where
near
dismissible
by
any
account
taste
followed
nose
exactly
only
giving
way
to
a
hint
of
spice
dash
of
berries
muted
at
best
but
still
there
as
a
characteristic
of
the
malt
used
i
would
guess
think
baltic
porter
backbone
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
cloyingly
so
usually
i
would
be
far
more
rough
on
a
beer
of
this
depth
for
being
watery
thin
but
i
fear
that
if
it
had
much
more
body
the
additional
volume
plus
sweetness
could
have
made
it
difficult
to
finish
my
biggest
complaint
for
this
beer
and
ultimately
what
rode
the
rating
down
was
the
near
terminal
lack
of
balance
this
was
all
over
the
road
without
actually
going
into
the
ditch
overall
its
like
a
bad
german
diesel
this
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
and
its
a
huge
disappointment
in
how
it
comes
out
from
the
nose
and
appearance
they
made
chocolate
cola
instead
drinkable
but
so
is
diet
coke
apparently
for
some
so
keep
that
in
mind
overall
this
is
only
marginally
better
than
the
shock
top
honey
bourbon
cask
wheat
id
say
drink
something
else
even
a
blue
moon
or
this
for
god
sakes
im
feeling
like
a
wasted
money
on
pissspour
shock
top
beer
when
i
could
have
bought
rolling
rock
or
miller
high
life
and
actually
had
a
more
enjoyable
time
drinking
those
for
less
money
a
light
feeling
chocolate
beer
i
thought
it
was
pretty
tasty
and
an
interesting
option
i
had
it
on
draft
at
a
wine
chocolate
festival
a
very
smooth
chocolate
beer
without
coffee
flavors
wow
this
is
just
a
mess
horrible
flavor
no
malt
as
you
would
expect
from
a
chocolate
beer
just
chocolate
and
wheat
but
i
cant
say
that
im
shocked
great
beer
considering
its
shocktop
come
on
outlier
my
only
complaint
with
this
one
is
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
and
for
a
dark
beer
other
than
that
awesome
tastes
like
a
hint
of
a
porter
but
more
like
its
a
chocolate
soda
with
low
abv
nice
taste
its
not
awesome
but
its
not
bad
its
a
lighter
beer
with
chocolate
hints
in
the
sent
and
taste
its
not
overly
sweet
so
it
can
be
sessioned
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
favored
wheats
to
a
novice
overall
not
to
shabby
overall
not
incredibly
impressive
but
it
is
yummy
id
have
it
again
and
again
it
is
more
flavorful
and
colalike
out
of
the
bottle
very
enjoyable
smooth
flavorful
with
an
almost
sweet
stout
like
character
coco
puffs
cheerwine
even
some
grape
come
through
in
this
sessionable
brew
very
soda
like
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
very
good
chocolate
flavor
without
being
cloying
got
a
bottle
for
free
at
work
this
is
pretty
decent
it
does
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
tin
bottle
its
got
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
with
vanilla
notes
i
dont
think
ill
rush
out
and
buy
a
sixer
for
home
but
i
did
enjoy
the
one
i
had
its
not
something
id
drink
if
i
was
thinking
i
want
a
beer

i
waited
about
two
months
too
long
to
drink
this
beer
i
found
it
at
the
local
grocery
store
and
thought
the
chocolate
malt
and
peppers
were
an
interesting
combination
they
were
albeit
almost
like
they
used
grapefruit
vary
bold
flavor
that
left
a
bitter
aftertaste
very
full
bodied
and
heavy
to
drink

now
they
are
giving
us
directions
on
how
to
pour
their
beer
i
am
a
astounded
and
b
disinterested
my
pour
created
a
nice
twofinger
cap
of
dense
shock
top
end
of
the
world
midnight
wheat
seems
slightly
better
than
other
shock
top
products
thanks
to
the
slightly
fuller
body
but
it
is
still
lacking
in
a
few
areas
it
may
not
be
the
end
of
the
world
but
those
who
sample
this
beer
may
very
well
hope
for
more
end
of
the
world
predictions
and
along
with
them
better
beer
products
that
use
this
theme
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
and
spices
taste
is
spicy
wheat
a
touch
of
chocolate
different
and
unique
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
took
me
three
bottles
of
this
stuff
for
me
to
figure
out
if
i
liked
it
enough
to
buy
again
i
think
i
will
i
like
the
spiciness
of
it
and
the
slight
taste
of
chili
even
though
id
like
it
even
more
if
those
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
the
chocolate
maltiness
is
nice
too
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
snappy
tasty
beer
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
the
shock
top
family
i
mean
i
know
its
an
anheuserbusch
product
i
just
mean
i
havent
tried
them
all
and
this
is
the
first
one
ive
reviewed
where
was
i
oh
yeah
so
anyway
its
not
bad
in
fact
its
actually
pretty
good
especially
if
you
remember
to
swirl
the
beer
around
a
little
in
the
bottle
when
theres
about
an
inch
left
in
it
before
pouring
it
all
into
your
glass
that
not
only
gives
you
a
little
extra
head
but
it
definitely
helps
bring
out
more
of
the
spicy
flavor
in
the
wheat
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
yeah
id
recommend
it
not
extremely
good
or
anything
but
better
than
average
and
definitely
impressive
for
abinbev
overall
overall
this
is
a
decent
diversion
from
the
normal
i
could
enjoy
a
6
pack
no
problem
but
12
would
find
themselves
sitting
in
the
fridge
a
bit
im
hoping
this
isnt
my
last
beer
if
the
world
ends
soon
nothing
exciting
overall
much
more
subtle
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
than
anticipated
pepper
is
not
overwhelmingly
hot
just
noticeable
ive
had
light
massproduced
beers
with
more
flavor
oh
wait
its
abinbev
o
not
great
overall
it
is
better
than
i
thought
but
could
easily
be
better
give
it
a
shot
if
your
not
into
anything
bold
a
lowend
entrylevel
brew
for
adventurous
bud
drinkers
still
its
a
try
at
something
different
and
could
be
someones
stepping
stone
towards
better
craft
beer
wow
surprise
what
a
great
beer
taste
like
a
scottish
ale
and
they
are
few
and
far
between
and
a
wheat
my
frist
great
great
look
great
pour
i
highy
recommend
this
beer
dont
know
what
other
want
in
their
but
this
is
what
i
want
what
i
like
so
enjoy
anytime
it
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
filmy
layer
doesnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
i
could
only
detect
some
wheat
citrus
and
hay
tastes
like
it
smells
just
a
little
better
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hop
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
and
is
actuallu
not
bad
now
this
beer
might
please
everybody
but
its
actually
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
more
honestly
this
beer
is
almost
perfect
it
pours
dark
brown
with
an
thick
offwhite
cream
that
quickly
fades
smell
is
of
spice
a
bit
of
pepper
and
the
tiniest
note
of
cocoa
taste
has
a
bitter
wheat
taste
that
fades
into
cocoa
if
you
have
a
small
taste
a
larger
taste
more
emphasizes
the
other
flavors
of
the
spices
as
well
as
the
chili
the
chili
flavor
gradually
grows
as
you
drink
the
beer
whoever
thought
chocolate
and
chili
should
go
together
was
a
culinary
genius
like
driving
past
a
car
wreck
i
just
had
to
try
this
not
something
id
like
to
repeat
o
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
its
an
interesting
take
and
im
glad
to
see
them
trying
new
things
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
any
time
soon
i
think
this
beer
is
far
better
than
any
of
the
other
shock
top
offerings
its
not
tremendously
flavored
and
it
wont
impressive
any
beer
snob
but
from
a
macro
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
that
dares
to
be
different
i
like
the
addition
of
the
cocoa
and
spices
with
a
wheat
base
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
id
also
like
to
see
other
breweries
try
something
similar
o
i
would
probably
give
it
a
3
25
but
i
cant
one
of
the
better
beers
from
shock
top
overall
focus
groups
overall
not
an
outstanding
chili
beer
but
im
going
to
finish
the
six
pack
and
could
see
ordering
this
if
nothing
better
is
available
probably
the
best
beer
in
the
shock
top
beer
series
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
likely
take
on
again
the
flavors
just
did
not
transition
or
even
go
well
with
each
other
not
my
thing
overall
i
bough
a
6
pack
of
this
and
this
is
number
51
bottle
per
sitting
i
kept
thinking
some
other
factor
was
influencing
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
but
i
think
its
just
average
with
some
above
average
marketing
o
shock
top
end
of
the
world
midnight
wheat
has
almost
nothing
going
for
it
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
bland
barely
managing
to
formulate
a
cohesive
direction
especially
with
all
the
ingredients
theyve
added
this
beer
isnt
bad
per
se
but
the
potential
for
it
was
big
and
shock
top
didnt
deliver
on
any
level
taste
is
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
heat
from
the
chilis
and
spices
its
a
different
kind
of
flavor
and
unlike
anything
else
ive
had
but
at
the
same
time
not
one
id
care
to
revisit
either
if
you
like
chili
on
a
chilly
fall
day
this
is
worth
trying
for
the
novelty
factor
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
much
more
than
that
its
also
a
fun
beer
to
try
with
nonba
friends
since
its
not
superweird
or
over
the
top
just
a
nice
beany
chili
flavor
on
top
of
an
easy
going
wheat
beer
base
burping
tastes
like
chili
15
min
after
finishing
half
finger
head
with
some
lacing
on
a
murkymuddy
brown
body
chocolate
malt
earthy
hops
and
breads
flavor
is
similar
with
a
chocolate
malt
base
pepper
earthy
good
and
a
slight
metallic
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
as
expected
a
bit
watery
under
malted
but
decent
flavor
for
the
brewer
this
is
one
of
the
best
three
ab
beers
i
have
had
i
know
there
are
150
micros
that
do
it
better
but
this
is
darn
good
and
will
reach
many
many
more
people
o
this
was
an
okay
brew
it
seems
a
bit
like
a
mix
of
several
different
styles
of
beer
ending
my
day
with
the
end
of
the
world
apropos
no
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
light
toffee
light
green
chiles
and
a
kiss
of
cocoa
powder
things
are
kinda
bland
and
fairly
muddled
the
taste
holds
notes
of
honey
light
toffee
light
cocoa
powder
mildly
spicy
chiles
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
toasted
biscuit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
grainy
feel
overall
not
a
bad
little
spicedchile
beer
one
that
doesnt
let
the
chiles
or
spices
overwhelm
the
background
malts
nor
viceversa
not
bad
actually
kinda
surprising
honestly
o
ok
it
says
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
theres
chili
and
spice
and
once
again
ill
use
that
old
wendys
line
wheres
the
chili
and
spice
so
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
so
complex
with
other
flavors
where
are
they
in
retrospect
i
will
say
fitting
name
as
this
will
be
the
end
of
the
world
for
this
beer
cue
dierks
bentley
what
was
i
thinking
i
was
curious
to
see
what
this
beer
was
about
and
grabbed
a
bottle
at
the
local
shop
it
said
midnight
wheat
hoped
it
was
black
but
it
looks
like
the
chocolate
malts
dominated
its
more
like
a
brownish
dunkel
weiss
if
you
say
there
is
midnight
wheat
make
it
black
as
midnight
lame
the
smell
is
not
amazing
but
its
definitely
different
you
can
smell
something
going
on
in
there
but
its
hard
to
notice
maybe
the
spices
but
not
sure
what
those
are
nutmeg
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
this
beer
is
pretty
good
nothing
outstanding
but
heck
it
kind
of
burns
from
the
peppers
but
in
the
flavor
its
hard
to
really
determine
what
is
going
on
kind
of
like
the
smell
it
totally
drinks
stronger
than
the
6
abv
on
the
bottle
i
have
had
10
beers
easier
to
drink
than
this
there
is
a
hint
of
dark
malts
but
no
hops
of
any
from
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
it
cleans
away
the
flavor
well
to
get
ready
for
another
sip
overall
this
is
not
that
bad
is
it
worth
a
6
pack
no
was
it
worth
a
sample
sure
if
you
are
into
wheat
beers
however
i
really
think
that
the
idea
was
a
good
one
but
at
a
macro
level
this
beer
kinda
fades
into
the
ether
and
i
cannot
see
myself
telling
folks
hey
that
beer
is
a
good
one
i
feel
that
the
label
got
more
time
than
the
formula
but
its
not
that
bad
i
think
i
am
more
or
less
disappointed
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
slight
amounts
of
cocoa
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
very
mild
chili
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
that
quickly
dies
out
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
taste
wise
but
the
smell
is
decent
enough
overall
a
confused
mildly
interesting
tasting
beer
from
the
megabrewer
anheuser
busch
but
far
too
watery
to
be
considered
a
fine
beer
without
some
fullness
or
broader
flavor
it
will
be
the
end
of
the
world
for
this
brew
had
to
do
it
pours
cloudy
tea
colored
with
a
etched
surface
of
tan
smells
of
wheat
coriander
cinnamon
some
milky
smells
tastes
like
powdered
cocoa
wheat
a
bit
of
charcoal
some
more
coriander
and
a
bit
of
fucking
terrible
no
its
just
terrible
thin
with
hi
carb
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
just
really
disappointing
from
such
a
reputable
brewer
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
its
okay
but
ill
stick
with
their
pumpkin
wheat
the
meat
and
chili
taste
was
unique
and
not
bad
but
this
beer
is
just
too
weird
its
not
awful
but
its
not
good
enough
to
want
again
and
again
i
commend
the
uniqueness
but
thats
about
it
overall
a
major
disappointment
given
the
interesting
description
of
this
beer
in
different
hands
i
think
a
dark
wheat
beer
with
chocolate
and
chilis
could
be
very
promising
unfortunately
shock
tops
version
is
just
too
light
and
halfassed
to
go
anywhere
just
a
strange
drink
with
a
mixed
smell
and
taste
did
anyone
at
ab
try
this
before
it
went
to
mass
production
the
feel
is
actually
the
best
aspect
the
body
reaches
medium
and
theres
a
creaminess
that
never
falls
off
along
with
a
crispness
that
is
similarly
steadfast
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
8
49
per
sixer
where
im
at
which
isnt
cheap
but
not
bad
i
know
that
this
will
probably
receive
poor
reviews
for
the
most
part
we
have
mostly
become
snobs
lol
but
it
is
a
easy
to
drink
session
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
for
the
cheap
price
and
the
ability
to
session
enjoy
keep
adding
new
beers
to
this
line
m
full
texture
creamy
final
thoughts
high
on
ingredients
and
low
on
flavor
would
i
drink
this
again
no
overall
not
an
outstanding
chili
beer
but
im
going
to
finish
the
six
pack
and
could
see
ordering
this
if
nothing
better
is
available
probably
the
best
beer
in
the
ab
shock
top
beer
series
perfect
for
the
winter
time
i
could
kick
back
in
a
cabin
in
the
woods
and
drink
this
all
night
enjoyed
form
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
spiced
brew
pours
an
attractive
rusty
red
with
a
light
off
white
head
of
dissipating
foam
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
and
solid
lacing
nose
of
ginger
caramel
malts
brown
sugars
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
are
up
front
spiced
with
ginger
and
brown
sugars
to
the
front
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
to
the
sides
and
rear
with
a
light
fresh
bread
flavor
rounding
it
all
out
smooth
yet
bracing
spice
brew
that
finishes
sweet
surprisingly
decent
for
what
it
is
although
will
admit
it
is
a
pumpkin
brew
minus
the
pumpkin
not
too
shabby
for
a
macro
micro
this
beer
remind
of
a
fall
pumpkin
beer
but
minus
the
pumpkin
its
full
of
the
traditional
spices
that
you
would
normally
get
in
a
pumpkin
beer
i
prob
wont
get
this
one
again
i
would
rather
have
the
pumpkin
added
to
for
the
extra
kick
very
good
beer
but
nothing
beats
ipa
i
just
be
rating
my
beer
taste
the
ginger
on
the
front
end
but
really
seems
like
a
basic
lager
drank
from
bottle
slightly
off
color
than
what
i
expected
it
smelled
like
gingerbread
with
hints
of
cinnamon
it
smells
like
what
the
label
is
promising
although
it
smelled
good
it
was
overly
sweet
and
unbalanced
sweet
upfront
and
a
little
metallic
on
the
back
end
a
little
lighter
than
what
i
expected
from
an
amber
i
normally
like
spiced
beers
but
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
just
average
a
lighter
winter
beer
good
feel
and
smooth
savoring
rjt
not
overpowering
with
ginger
flavor
like
some
of
its
competitors
good
drinkability
ehh
wasnt
really
impressed
gingerbread
flavor
was
light
and
not
over
powering
but
would
never
get
again

this
beer
was
pretty
good
this
one
and
the
cinnamon
horatcha
out
of
the
taster
pack
are
pretty
savage
my
pallet
disapproves
this
beer
is
average
at
best
delicious
was
surprised
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
did
i
wish
i
could
get
a
12
it
is
the
perfect
blen
of
spices
without
being
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
loved
it
i
was
reticent
trying
this
knowing
how
easy
it
would
be
for
coors
to
fuck
it
up
with
too
much
gingerbread
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
i
love
gingerbread
and
was
hoping
for
a
vibrantly
flavored
beer
but
this
one
is
not
that
its
one
of
the
few
in
this
latest
craze
of
flavored
beers
like
shock
tops
and
blue
moons
that
is
not
overly
flavored
and
im
a
little
let
down
by
that
although
its
been
undesirable
in
other
flavors
i
get
a
little
spice
to
it
more
fresh
ginger
than
ginger
bread
but
very
little
else
to
make
this
unique
the
malt
seems
watered
down
and
caramel
based
and
the
yeast
character
is
entirely
absent
its
not
bad
beer
just
really
light
for
something
thats
supposed
to
be
hearty
enough
for
winter
a
hunt
of
brown
sugar
to
it
and
some
wheat
malt
thats
about
all
i
really
get
from
this
thing
its
beers
like
this
that
remind
why
i
drink
the
kind
of
beers
that
i
do
and
its
always
nice
to
flash
back
to
this
world
once
in
a
while
for
that
purpose
defining
clarity
nothing
special
here
except
more
fuel
in
my
already
roaring
craft
beer
loving
fire
blue
moon
gingerbread
spiced
ale
brewed
by
coors
brewing
company
with
an
abv
of
5
90
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
spices
gingerbread
spiced
ale
puts
you
in
the
mind
of
christmas
cookies
not
saying
that
is
a
bad
thing
you
also
pick
up
on
some
gains
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
at
the
end
of
the
is
brew
there
is
a
nice
smoothness
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
coors
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again

c
ill
most
likely
update
this
review
again
later
since
i
want
to
take
notes
while
experiencing
it
but
this
beer
really
clicked
for
me
it
was
perfectly
balanced
in
pretty
much
every
way
the
flavor
was
gingerbread
spice
just
as
the
name
labeled
it
i
hate
when
beers
say
they
taste
like
something
and
end
up
not
doing
so
this
was
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
overall
maybe
better
on
tap
id
give
it
a
shot
if
i
saw
it
but
not
one
id
revisit
otherwise
i
was
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
brew
its
just
too
bad
i
walked
away
slightly
disappointed
advertised
as
a
gingerbread
spiced
ale
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
gingerbread
odor
and
taste
neither
of
which
i
could
pull
out
of
the
beer
the
definite
ale
base
is
there
nothing
overly
spectacular
or
different
from
any
other
ale
but
i
just
couldnt
really
taste
the
gingerbread
and
that
is
one
distinctive
flavor
anyway
ignoring
the
lack
of
gingerbread
flavoring
it
is
a
decent
ale
this
one
i
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
right
off
the
bat
after
opening
was
hit
with
the
aroma
of
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
if
right
on
a
mix
of
gingerbread
cinnamon
nutmeg
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
had
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
its
amber
in
color
and
clear
and
has
a
2
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
of
nutmeg
ginger
cinnamon
tastes
like
it
was
intended
like
a
gingerbread
inside
a
german
wheat
not
bitter
at
all
carbonation
was
minimal
and
the
beer
was
smooth
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
thought
it
would
be
too
sweet
but
it
wasnt
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
embossed
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
light
bodied
well
carbonated
feel
overall
this
is
an
interesting
ale
aptly
named
this
is
reminiscent
of
the
namesake
o
it
is
what
its
intended
to
bea
malty
brew
reminiscent
of
gingerbread
feels
overly
spritzy
despite
a
firmer
body
than
i
wouldve
expected
better
than
i
hoped
but
still
too
much
on
the
thin
side
like
the
aroma
the
gingerbread
is
front
and
center
in
the
taste
but
the
cinnamon
spices
also
kick
in
and
lead
to
a
bitter
bite
at
the
finish
it
really
feels
like
a
winter
warmer
overall
close
to
a
gingerbread
beer
but
it
could
have
been
sweeter
o
too
bad
this
is
a
oneoff
i
would
drink
it
again
sincerely
recommended
darker
shade
of
amber
with
a
transient
light
brown
head
smells
like
ginger
and
bread
biscuits
although
its
mostly
a
one
dimensional
ginger
blast
taste
follows
with
a
tongue
piercing
bite
of
ginger
that
stays
consistently
assertive
underlying
notes
of
cracker
biscuit
nutmeg
caramel
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
aggressive
making
the
spicy
ginger
more
persistent
this
one
is
the
most
drinkable
of
the
sampler
pack
but
the
weak
body
combined
with
aggressive
carbonation
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
like
to
visit
blue
moon
and
sam
adams
from
time
to
time
to
acknowledge
my
roots
and
again
i
had
my
wife
looking
out
for
me
and
this
was
a
very
welcome
beer
i
wish
it
got
cold
here
so
i
could
really
feel
at
home
but
this
gets
me
close
maybe
its
the
label
maybe
its
the
ginger
and
cinnamon
but
there
is
definitely
a
bit
of
nostalgia
with
this
one
id
grab
a
six
if
it
were
offered
improvements
could
be
amping
up
the
lacing
and
the
aroma
not
falling
off
overall
a
decent
and
rather
easy
drinking
ale
for
the
price
a
bit
weak
on
the
body
but
rather
pleasant
on
all
other
fronts
apple
pie
in
a
glass
very
refreshing
nice
surprise
was
prepared
for
this
to
be
awful
but
actually
had
a
pretty
decent
taste
serving
type
bottle
poured
onto
pint
glass
looks
great
golden
honey
color
with
decent
head
smells
slightly
sweet
and
defiantly
cinnamon
and
spiraling
downwards
from
here
it
taste
like
a
blue
moon
thats
been
open
in
the
fridge
for
days
but
still
has
a
strange
cola
type
carbonation
this
is
easily
the
worst
of
the
beers
in
the
spring
sampler
im
gonna
give
the
other
one
to
a
local
homeless
and
i
am
pretty
sure
i
ll
be
lucky
if
he
doesnt
break
out
my
car
windows
for
it
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
but
turned
out
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
an
interesting
mexican
twist
on
blue
moon
try
it
if
youre
a
horchata
fan
for
the
smell
alone
from
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
ale
pours
a
lightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
firm
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
ring
and
light
lacing
nose
of
cinnamon
duh
and
light
caramel
malts
flavors
follow
the
nose
with
cinnamon
and
caramel
malts
a
serious
cinnamon
spiciness
to
the
rear
blending
with
a
small
dose
of
grassy
hops
and
even
more
cinnamon
crisp
and
lightly
dry
mouth
feel
highly
carbonated
while
i
may
not
be
a
fan
of
this
one
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
really
good
taste
by
blue
moon
nice
cinnamon
horchata
taste
without
being
over
the
top
o
its
exactly
what
blue
moon
intended
it
to
be
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
an
enjoyable
brew
nonetheless
smelled
just
like
cinnamon
and
tasted
excellent
sweet
and
tasty
probably
more
for
dessert
prefer
ipa
but
this
beer
does
taste
good
at
first
glance
looked
like
a
decent
beer
it
smelled
pretty
good
can
definitely
tell
there
is
cinnamon
thats
all
i
can
say
is
good
about
this
personally
the
cinnamon
was
overpowering
and
i
was
not
digging
the
rice
i
tried
drinking
as
much
as
i
could
hoping
it
would
get
better
but
in
the
end
it
was
a
sink
poor
for
me
i
twisted
off
the
cap
and
gave
it
an
aggro
pour
until
the
foaming
action
was
too
much
to
handle
backing
off
i
watched
as
it
formed
two
fluffy
fingers
of
snow
white
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
srm

but
the
purity
was
too
flawed
for
my
golddigging
buddies
midas
croesus
and
mammon
to
want
to
show
up
nose
smelled
like
rice
pudding
with
cinnamon
atop
i
have
not
had
mexican
horchata
in
many
years
but
this
was
really
evocative
of
it
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
taste
was
rice
pudding
with
cinnamon
but
not
as
pronounced
as
on
the
nose
that
said
as
it
warmed
it
really
began
to
live
up
to
its
billing
this
was
such
a
pleasant
counterbalance
to
the
previous
beers
this
afternoon
that
i
was
ecstatic
that
i
had
saved
it
until
now
finish
was
semisweet
but
nowhere
near
as
cloying
as
it
couldmight
have
been
i
must
get
theoldlady
to
try
some
and
give
me
her
opinion
so
this
beer
is
like
eating
a
churro
very
smooth
and
the
cinnamon
is
not
over
powering
as
i
expected
body
hits
heavy
but
finishes
light
whatever
that
means
not
what
i
expected
from
coorsblue
moon
but
i
like
this
one
would
seek
out
if
it
ever
made
it
to
sixers
what
a
interesting
idea
that
totally
did
not
work
out
glad
i
only
got
1
in
a
pick
6
imagining
horchata
as
a
beer
is
difficult
and
set
the
beer
up
to
be
either
disgusting
or
surprisingly
good
for
me
this
fell
on
the
good
side
drank
from
a
bottle
it
had
an
almost
overwhelming
and
surprisingly
pleasant
cinnamon
smell
it
actually
got
the
core
taste
of
horchata
without
being
undrinkable
due
to
sweetness
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
light
carbonation
and
a
very
light
tongue
feel
the
traditional
wheat
taste
was
not
strong
but
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
as
a
desert
beer
it
is
pretty
good
i
got
it
out
of
curiosity
and
had
low
expectations
for
it
even
though
i
expected
it
to
be
a
cavity
beer

use
more

and
less

purchased
as
part
of
a

12
pack
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
cinnamon
horchata
ale
i
just
reviewed
kinda
strange
taste
for
a
beer
but
not
bad
the
verdict
not
bad
a
little
different
a
bit
funky
i
dont
see
myself
ever
ordering
one
but
it
is
drinkable
kind
of
a
variation
on
a
pumpkin
ale
more
than
anything
else
decent
this
offering
has
potential
but
in
classic
blue
moon
fashion
the
aromas
and
flavors
come
across
as
watered
down
and
underachieving
overall
2
39
a
fail
i
do
not
like
this
beer
sam
i
am
the
moldy
appearance
on
the
top
after
the
head
recedes
is
so
offputting
its
like
i
left
iced
tea
in
the
den
and
forgot
about
it
for
4
days
the
flavor
is
awful
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
far
ahead
of
it
if
they
sold
this
in
six
pack
bottles
people
would
demand
that
this
be
taken
off
the
market
im
glad
i
only
got
two
of
these
in
my
variety
pack
there
was
an
oddness
to
this
flavor
that
i
just
couldnt
place
slightly
bitter
lacking
something
the
spices
overshadowed
the
usual
pleasant
warmth
and
fullness
of
the
wheat
i
didnt
taste
any
apple
only
a
hint
at
what
should
be
caramel
but
came
off
more
chemical
in
taste
than
treat
not
a
flavor
i
would
choose
intentionally
and
coupled
with
the
farmhouse
red
it
will
probably
keep
me
from
buying
any
more
of
the
fall
cases
even
though
i
enjoy
the
horchata
and
pumpkin
theres
a
reason
this
is
a
limited
autumn
release
as
its
so
far
the
weakest
fall
seasonal
ive
had
i
found
this
hiding
in
my
fridge
when
i
poured
it
it
has
a
carmel
color
body
with
a
very
little
head
the
smell
is
very
faint
of
cinnamon
and
i
get
a
grain
also
the
taste
has
a
cinnamon
up
front
and
as
it
warms
up
the
apple
comes
out
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
it
reminds
me
of
christmas
drink
clear
medium
to
dark
brown
copperish
color
smells
malty
slight
wheat
aroma
with
hints
of
tart
apples
medium
carbonation
apple
and
caramel
flavors
very
muted
taste
more
like
spiced
apple
juice
mixed
with
crappy
beer
in
the
forefront
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
thanks
again
for
the
disappointment
blue
moon
no
caramel
flavor
what
so
ever
lame
o
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
underrated
due
to
the
fact
that
its
brewed
by
coors
their
beers
are
often
decent
even
above
average
this
is
my
personal
favorite
and
it
is
much
better
than
most
of
what
they
make
definitely
worth
a
try
given
the
price
tag
o
this
had
the
potential
to
be
really
good
but
like
most
of
blue
moons
creations
it
just
seemed
watered
down
and
lacking
any
strong
malty
backbone
taste
starts
out
with
a
mild
caramel
malt
front
the
spicing
while
strong
on
the
nose
is
fairly
weak
on
the
tongue
finishes
with
a
weird
metallic
finish
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
with
a
pretty
thin
body
that
makes
this
beer
too
watery
blue
moon
caramel
apple
spiced
ale
has
a
very
thick
creamy
creamcolored
head
a
clear
bubbly
copper
appearance
and
a
fairly
good
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
of
spices
breads
and
some
juice
taste
is
very
spiced
juicy
bready
and
sweet
certainly
flavorful
also
there
is
a
nice
grain
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
slick
and
blue
moon
caramel
apple
spiced
ale
finishes
mostly
dry
sweet
somewhat
cloying
and
easily
drinkable
overall
this
is
good
and
it
is
outstanding
for
a
flavored
beer
rjt
overall
not
a
very
exciting
beer
i
would
not
waste
my
money
on
this
one
again
taste
is
an
artifical
sweet
upfront
a
fleeting
apple
tartness
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
moderate
spices
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
drinkability
is
kind
of
knocked
for
me
due
to
the
spicing
although
hard
to
fault
its
in
the
name
of
the
beer
have
to
admit
not
as
bad
as
i
feared
although
thats
not
particularly
a
glowing
review
to
good
health
and
good
beer
o
a
great
fall
beer
wish
the
caramel
apples
would
come
in
6
pack
instead
of
the
bluemoon
variety
pack
must
try
this
beer
sensational
flavor
overall
i
dont
think
these
flavors
work
well
in
a
beer
this
is
my
least
favorite
blue
moon
offering
and
i
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
spice
caramel
and
slight
apple
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
apple
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
displays
the
characteristics
in
its
name
but
everything
is
quite
subdued
all
around
this
is
just
a
rather
bland
beer
a
friend
of
a
friend
brought
this
over
for
me
to
try
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
well
its
not
bad
it
just
struggles
a
bit
to
be
okay
o
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
again
i
prefer
regular
blue
moon
the
metallic
taste
and
high
malt
is
just
unappealing
i
would
much
rather
have
a
cider
either
hard
or
nonalcoholic
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
is
all
this
has
going
for
it
o
interesting
brew
well
spiced
first
review
in
a
long
while
too
bad
i
didnt
write
one
on
a
better
beer
at
least
i
didnt
buy
it
doesnt
go
well
with
food
either
o
a
great
attempt
at
bridging
the
ciderbeer
categories
but
not
worth
looking
into
when
beer
has
better
autumn
styles
and
theres
the
entire
cider
market
kudos
for
trying
it
though
o
good
blue
moon
doesnt
make
bad
beers
really
but
never
actually
shines
either
this
is
what
one
would
expect
from
such
a
brewery
overall
a
tasty
brew
from
blue
moon
the
spicing
was
actually
pretty
subtle
tasty
summer
beer
o
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
decent
for
the
style
o
overall
i
didnt
really
like
the
beer
i
didnt
get
any
spice
and
im
not
completely
convinced
that
i
even
really
tasted
apple
in
this
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
if
youre
buying
it
based
on
the
packaging
on
a
side
note
my
bottle
says
8
which
it
hides
very
well
im
not
sure
if
the
5
8
displayed
on
ba
is
from
an
old
version
or
what
overall
a
very
nice
seasonal
beer
representation
just
put
on
the
shelve
today
at
the
local
store
part
of
a
make
your
own
6
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
whitishtan
head
very
little
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
cinnamon
apples
and
grain
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
very
tasty
and
goes
down
very
easy
no
bad
aftertaste
and
gets
you
in
the
mood
for
autumn
and
football
baby
really
liked
this
one
2

o
overall
a
good
beer
for
fall
by
the
bonfire
just
chilling
with
friends
or
whatever
great
value
for
the
low
price
really
amazed
this
is
a
coors
product
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
as
clear
as
the
evening
sky
on
a
quiet
and
warm
summer
night
its
slightly
disturbed
by
mild
carbonation
racing
to
the
top
only
to
be
hidden
among
the
many
densely
packed
bubbles
forming
the
thick
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
rather
light
but
traces
of
brown
sugar
raisin
pumpkin
caramel
and
a
few
spices
do
come
through
clearly
the
taste
is
decent
some
apple
and
cinnamon
come
through
a
bit
of
alcohol
can
be
tasted
as
it
hits
the
back
of
your
throat
and
theres
plenty
of
sweetness
i
this
beer
not
as
sweet
as
a
lambic
but
it
is
there
not
a
bad
beer
over
all
i
would
mind
having
this
a
few
more
times
pours
a
clear
amber
little
no
no
head
nose
has
faint
spices
along
with
moderately
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
brings
the
note
of
faint
spice
and
faint
apple
juice
with
sweet
caramel
malts
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
lacking
in
carbonation
lifeless
beer
that
could
benefit
from
a
bigger
dose
of
everything
noting
horribley
off
putting
just
bland
o
i
must
admit
i
probably
waited
to
long
to
review
this
bottle
it
did
not
hold
up
well
i
would
like
to
review
it
fresher
i
like
this
beer
and
would
hope
that
it
becomes
a
regular
seasonal
nice
offering
from
coors
o
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
still
enjoyable
they
achieve
what
they
advertised
there
is
a
definite
subtle
hint
of
caramel
apples
and
spices
easy
to
drink
and
was
a
hit
with
several
of
my
nyc
area
evacuees
and
hosts
inoffensive
and
simple
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
id
seek
out
has
an
autumn
feel
overall
a
pretty
standard
spiced
beer
unfortunately
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
pretty
intriguing
and
promising
name
the
cinnamon
so
overpowers
any
apple
flavor
that
you
really
would
have
a
hard
time
telling
this
apart
from
any
other
seasonal
spiced
beer
still
kudos
to
blue
mooncoors
for
taking
a
stab
at
it
overall
a
decent
attempt
on
a
liquid
version
of
the
seasonal
caramel
apple
favorite
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
added
in
the
mix
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longnck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
o
bland
boring
and
mislabled
seems
just
hastily
or
lazily
put
together
a
misfire
o
meh
this
beer
is
a
letdown
to
me
should
be
more
sweet
and
appley
carmel
apple
come
on
the
beer
goes
well
with
some
shitty
new
age
music
from
windham
hill
records
the
taste
and
the
aroma
have
much
in
common
with
sweet
caramel
malts
apple
spices
and
a
lower
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
moment
and
then
fades
off
altogether
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
blue
moon
overall
coors
did
a
good
job
with
this
definitely
a
winner
as
far
as
novelty
beers
are
concerned
pours
a
beaitiful
deep
red
with
about
an
inch
of
head
heavy
aroma
of
apple
and
spice
caramel
is
suspiciously
absent
in
both
aroma
and
taste
though
i
assume
its
being
used
more
as
a
thickening
agent
making
it
more
beer
than
cider
which
it
succeeds
in
and
much
smoother
very
fruity
but
not
overpowering
though
the
aftertaste
is
a
pleasant
apple
spice
on
the
back
of
the
pallete
large
gulps
reveal
more
body
but
this
is
really
more
of
a
sipping
beer
and
at
that
its
very
appley
nice
alternative
to
pumpkin
ales
of
the
season
though
why
one
should
want
an
alternative
to
pumpkin
ales
is
beyond
me
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
though
i
am
not
sure
i
would
choose
it
over
the
blue
moon
pumpkin
which
this
year
is
fantastic
average
but
not
great
spiced
ale
despite
the
caramel
and
apples
in
the
name
neither
is
really
present
the
spices
come
through
nicely
though
the
biggest
problem
is
the
flavor
which
is
just
a
little
bland
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
too
sweet
but
it
could
actually
stand
to
be
a
little
sweeter
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
kind
of
interesting
i
guess
and
something
i
will
surely
finish
off
but
coors
needs
to
work
a
little
harder
if
they
want
to
compete
with
the
micros
pours
ruby
red
with
half
a
finger
worth
of
head
leaving
no
lacing
smells
of
fresh
baked
apple
pie
crust
with
some
pumpkin
thrown
into
the
mix
is
this
an
apple
pie
in
a
bottle
tastes
like
apple
pie
crust
with
a
huge
hit
of
cinnamon
would
be
wonderful
if
it
werent
for
the
massive
sweetness
that
hits
during
the
swallowing
the
mouthfeel
is
of
strong
cinnamon
and
an
absolutely
choking
sweetness
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
damn
sweet
seriously
tone
it
down
the
flavors
were
pretty
good
though
my
roommate
brought
home
a
blue
moon
autumn
sampler
pack
and
i
couldnt
help
but
try
this
one
it
pours
out
a
redcopper
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
spiced
it
smells
like
a
generic
pumpkin
beer
the
taste
is
again
mostly
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
theres
a
bit
of
clarity
in
the
middle
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
pretty
uninspiring
stuff
its
basically
just
a
different
spin
on
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
they
were
going
for
a
caramel
apple
flavor
and
id
say
they
missed
their
target
it
tastes
more
akin
to
that
last
bit
of
apple
pie
crust
thats
left
in
the
tin
with
just
a
bit
of
the
filling
left
on
the
piece
it
gives
you
hints
of
just
how
delicious
that
pie
was
but
it
leaves
your
craving
completely
and
utterly
unsatisfied
in
closure
this
beer
is
absolutely
an
embarrassment
i
wasnt
sure
whether
to
list
this
as
a
fruit
beer
a
spiced
beer
or
something
else
so
if
anyone
wants
to
change
the
style
feel
free
either
way
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
stuff
since
it
was
put
out
as
a
test
batch
a
while
back
it
pours
a
clear
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
tenuous
dirtybeige
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
caramel
and
way
in
the
back
some
light
green
apple
flesh
yeah
i
could
see
that
being
spiced
caramel
apple
the
taste
focuses
on
the
caramel
and
cinnamon
adding
here
and
there
some
light
clove
notes
theres
a
vague
sense
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
apple
in
there
as
well
but
it
may
just
be
wishful
thinking
based
on
the
label
regardless
theres
definitely
some
sort
of
fruitiness
in
there
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
seemingly
grainy
feel
its
really
not
grainy
but
it
seems
as
though
some
ground
cinnamon
is
floating
about
in
suspension
seriously
overall
this
may
not
completely
live
up
to
the
billing
but
it
does
deliver
on
the
spice
and
in
that
regard
it
aint
half
bad
id
have
another
serving
type
bottle
overall
it
isnt
that
interesting
to
begin
with
but
the
diacetyl
is
a
deal
breaker
hints
of
orange
flavor
falls
flat
not
their
alpines
best
effort
o
a
fine
honey
ale
o
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
for
those
hot
sunny
days
when
you
need
something
that
will
not
hold
you
down
this
beer
is
nicely
spiced
and
easy
to
drink
my
wife
and
her
girlfriend
really
enjoyed
this
brew
during
the
afternoon
simple
drinking
here
pours
a
light
amber
hue
with
golden
edges
fluffy
white
head
decent
retention
with
some
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
german
malt
light
orange
zest
and
spice
flavor
follows
the
nose
real
nice
malt
bill
the
orange
zest
and
coriander
are
subtle
and
the
honey
is
nice
finishes
with
light
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
warm
summer
months
in
california
or
great
for
an
anytime
session
beer
sorry
i
might
just
be
in
a
pissy
mood
but
this
is
rather
bland
with
a
funky
aftertaste
why
go
into
details
kind
of
novelty
tasting
harsh
very
difficult
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
5
oz
flight
taster
sure
but
never
a
22oz
bottle
sorry
guys
still
cant
wait
to
make
the
drive
down
to
taste
your
good
stuff
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
great
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
and
definitely
wouldnt
if
i
was
at
alpine
beer
company
o
such
a
bad
beer
from
a
great
brewery
oalpine
does
such
wonders
with
hoppy
beers
and
then
i
tried
this
ouch
avoid
while
light
this
is
not
what
i
would
call
refreshing
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
yesterday
at
the
brewery
raul
did
it
once
and
he
wont
do
it
again
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
with
negligible
head
the
nose
is
relatively
neutral
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
honey
and
spice
the
taste
is
a
boring
with
a
similar
drabness
very
malt
forward
touch
of
spice
my
major
complaint
is
that
the
beer
is
horribly
undercarbonated
syrupy
reminds
me
of
capri
sun
underwhelming
beer
that
id
probably
pass
on
in
the
future
high
b
pour
is
transparent
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
some
large
bubbles
nose
is
heavy
pilsner
grain
lightly
toasted
with
light
notes
of
citric
orange
and
a
honey
tinge
underneath
taste
is
more
balanced
the
honey
gives
it
a
creamy
body
and
adds
gently
to
the
toasted
grain
also
some
caramel
malt
notes
sweet
but
well
attenuated
with
citrus
notes
and
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
very
interesting
beer
nicely
balanced
and
well
done
pours
golden
orangeyellow
or
is
that
the
power
of
suggestion
talking
grainy
sweet
high
note
on
the
finish
but
not
overall
too
sweet
long
finish
particularly
the
orange
and
honey
honey
is
noticeable
orange
not
so
much
long
finish
is
like
orange
cream
good
not
a
particularly
noteworthy
beer
the
appearence
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
the
smell
is
slightly
better
than
what
i
would
expect
from
a
macrolager
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
honey
in
it
which
might
be
interesting
if
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
more
solid
because
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
so
lacking
the
honey
just
seems
like
its
an
attempt
to
hide
the
impurities
and
imperfections
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
flat
and
unremarkable
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
unless
there
was
really
nothing
else
around
b
o
light
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
odd
t
wasnt
really
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
a
lot
of
sweetness
mainly
like
an
orange
syrup
kind
of
sweetness
with
a
lot
of
honey
throughout
as
it
warms
it
develops
more
of
a
yeast
flavor
i
probably
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
o
ok
beer
very
sweet
and
thick
probably
wouldnt
buy
in
the
store
if
i
saw
it
d
very
drinkable
super
sessionable
on
the
light
side
but
still
has
some
good
flavors
and
very
nice
balance
mediumlight
bodied
with
carbonation
just
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
fairly
crisp
and
clean
in
the
finish
and
overall
mouthfeel
good
summer
refresher
i
suppose
again
this
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
but
not
all
that
memorable
or
exceptional
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
zesty
spice
citrus
sweetness
and
bready
yeast
not
overly
spicy
or
dominantoverpowering
in
any
area
really
well
balanced
with
honey
sweetness
orange
and
apricot
countered
by
spicy
pepper
and
coriander
notes
not
overly
complex
but
flavorful
and
very
quaffable
o
soso
not
particularly
drinkable
which
would
be
the
one
redeeming
feature
of
this
style
of
beer
i
was
also
expecting
more
mandarin
punch
i
think
its
funny
how
average
alpines
regular
offerings
are
overall
nice
beer
to
reach
for
if
you
want
something
light
bodied
and
nice
citrus
and
slight
sweetness
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
pretty
bland
and
boring
from
a
brewery
i
really
respect
ill
be
sticking
with
their
ipas
a
sweet
orange
and
honey
ale
some
might
think
this
is
too
sweet
and
im
almost
in
that
group
alpine
makes
far
better
offerings
to
have
this
one
again
o
a
little
sweet
but
i
was
really
digging
the
flavor
pretty
good
mouthfeel
and
overall
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
far
from
my
favorite
alpine
beer
but
not
bad
all
around
i
hope
it
was
just
an
aberation
from
these
guys
weird
something
like
this
would
ever
leave
the
brewery
weird
stuff
first
the
slight
diacetyl
with
emerson
this
summer
and
then
to
be
followed
by
this
failure
i
guess
ill
stick
w
their
world
class
ipas
from
here
on
out
and
ravens
odin
or
vice
versa
overall
its
very
drinkable
and
not
a
terrible
beer
there
is
just
absolutely
nothing
special
or
distinguishing
about
it
i
think
they
need
to
revise
the
recipe
because
they
have
so
many
other
amazing
beers
o
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
first
brew
from
alpine
that
i
dont
like
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
or
its
just
not
that
great
either
way
this
is
a
swing
and
miss
for
alpine
this
is
pretty
good
actually
after
not
sounding
like
anything
too
interesting
good
for
the
style
at
least
from
a
22
oz
bottle
courtesy
of
a
trade
with
hamilton23
poured
a
light
orangeyellow
with
small
onefinger
head
which
quickly
disappeared
little
lacing
observed
nose
was
orange
lemon
and
some
spice
coriander
and
nuttiness
and
some
belgianlike
yeast
taste
was
very
sweet
with
oranges
and
honey
in
the
forefront
there
is
some
hint
of
spice
in
the
back
but
this
beer
stays
on
the
same
theme
throughout
sweet
since
i
love
the
hoppy
offerings
of
this
brewer
i
was
disappointed
to
find
not
much
here
i
felt
like
it
should
be
syrupy
but
actually
it
has
a
pretty
light
mouthfeel
it
has
very
little
carbonation
and
seems
to
beg
for
more
alpine
has
so
many
good
beers
but
sadly
this
isnt
one
of
them
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
of
these
overall
this
is
just
what
alpine
says
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
a
nice
summer
time
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
hot
days
i
like
it
and
think
its
a
nice
beer
i
would
have
with
some
bbq
actually
a
nice
duck
salad
would
probably
work
great
with
this
beer
since
this
beer
much
lighter
on
the
pallet
i
think
it
would
pair
really
well
since
we
are
all
feeling
the
heat
this
summer
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
appreciating
on
you
local
beer
store
shelf
alpine
mandarin
is
light
and
drinkable
but
displays
great
orange
flavors
that
keep
it
interesting
it
could
be
more
complex
but
for
a
summer
day
its
quenching
and
does
the
job
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
summer
lighter
medium
body
mild
carbonation
sticky
and
light
on
the
tongue
the
orange
flavors
were
nice
but
this
was
too
sweet
for
me
my
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
did
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summers
day
o
one
and
done
this
beer
just
sounded
like
it
would
be
better
than
it
was
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
a
personal
let
down
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
while
working
the
bbq
or
floating
down
the
river
overall
this
is
a
light
fruity
beer
that
while
i
find
nothing
offensive
about
it
it
just
doesnt
strike
my
fancy
drink
it
was
okay
wasnt
bad
just
didnt
blow
me
over
like
i
expected
it
too
drinkabilitythis
is
a
nice
easydrinking
fruit
beer
that
has
good
orange
notes
its
interesting
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
full
bomber
of
this
d
while
not
the
worst
beer
ever
its
not
all
that
good
and
the
drinkability
is
merely
average
at
6
5
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
clean
aroma
with
minimal
fruit
notes
of
orange
light
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
very
clean
with
some
touches
of
fruit
orange
dominates
the
flavor
over
anything
else
with
really
no
hop
notes
to
speak
of
lightly
sweet
start
and
stays
sweet
the
entire
time
a
very
straight
forward
easy
drinking
beer
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
like
though
for
a
fruit
beer
d
one
of
my
least
favorite
from
one
of
my
most
favorite
breweries
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
above
average
drinkability
is
decent
it
was
pretty
light
but
flavorful
and
went
down
easy
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
a
hot
day
however
it
felt
a
bit
big
and
heavy
to
fit
that
bill
perfectly
skip
for
everyone
just
kind
of
a
not
that
great
beer
i
love
alpines
ipadipas
but
this
is
the
second
non
ipadipa
that
i
have
tried
by
alpine
that
just
isnt
that
good
my
pour
created
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
eggshellwhite
head
with
nice
retention
color
was
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
both
orangecitrusy
and
lightly
spicy
like
black
pepper
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
orange
zest
on
the
tongue
the
label
mentioned
honey
but
i
missed
out
on
that
the
finish
was
dry
with
the
pepperycoriander
presence
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
yum
when
i
purchased
mandarin
nectar
i
thought
id
be
getting
a
light
refreshing
orange
wheat
ale
wrong
this
is
a
spiced
orange
ale
with
plenty
of
meat
on
its
bones
a
tasty
wheat
ale
but
the
irony
here
is
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
lighter
yet
another
alpine
brew
that
ive
liked
i
have
an
expo
i
cant
wait
to
try
out
next
d
pretty
sweet
for
my
palate
and
probably
could
not
drink
a
whole
one
by
myself
man
i
wish
i
could
get
more
alpine
brews
closer
to
me
i
could
drink
a
pitcher
of
this
at
the
bar
easily
d
i
suppose
i
should
have
looked
into
this
beer
a
bit
more
before
i
bought
it
but
this
was
one
of
the
few
disappointing
alpine
beers
ive
had
overall
nothing
to
offensive
to
warrant
a
negative
review
its
a
good
beer
just
not
great
drinkability
honestly
pretty
drinkable
in
my
onion
i
am
quaffing
this
down
as
i
type
and
it
is
tasting
pretty
good
right
before
dinner
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
by
any
means
because
of
the
price
and
as
stated
i
feel
i
could
concoct
a
blue
moon
to
achieve
the
same
taste
for
half
the
price
but
a
good
beer
to
try
nonetheless
pours
a
light
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
reasonable
amount
of
belgian
lacing
i
had
an
expectation
with
mandarin
nectar
and
the
smell
didnt
support
that
on
any
level
all
i
got
was
a
roasty
macro
lager
thing
the
flavor
is
a
monochromatic
roast
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the
watery
side
not
going
to
finish
this
one
the
body
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
giving
a
mouthfeel
about
on
par
with
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
id
say
this
was
a
letdown
only
because
i
expected
greatness
from
everything
this
brewery
makes
and
the
label
seems
to
promise
more
than
is
delivered
but
not
bad
if
approached
with
no
preconceptions
a
more
than
solid
pale
ale
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
nice
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
smell
is
somewhat
caramelized
in
the
background
with
some
orange
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
honey
coming
through
fairly
wellbalanced
and
another
solid
fruit
offering
from
alpine
highly
drinkable
nice
and
crisp
d
very
drinkable
but
not
all
that
impressive
might
be
a
good
beach
beer
d
smooth
and
refreshing
enjoying
this
beer
more
as
it
warms
although
it
is
still
lacking
a
bit
in
orangey
goodness
given
the
name
i
expected
more
still
think
would
be
a
pretty
good
summertime
drinker
but
plenty
more
out
there
that
i
would
choose
first
d
nice
sweet
summer
treat
what
do
i
say
about
this
beer
it
tastes
artificial
though
i
doubt
the
orange
flavoring
is
anything
less
than
genuine
its
just
so
overwhelming
and
intrusive
pretty
much
disapointed
in
this
beer
from
a
great
little
brewery
color
is
gold
with
a
rather
small
head
the
aroma
was
that
of
an
orange
extract
not
truly
fresh
no
hop
character
the
flavor
was
pretty
mediocre
with
that
of
malt
and
light
toasted
grain
some
citrus
but
it
is
more
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
low
to
medium
and
could
have
used
a
more
carbonation
d
very
much
so
i
might
have
to
for
a
growled
next
light
to
medium
in
body
interesting
flavor
easy
as
pie
to
drink
a
good
solid
offering
from
a
great
little
brewery
get
some
d
an
interesting
fruit
beer
from
alpine
im
just
glad
it
wasnt
filled
with
artificial
flavour
and
one
could
easily
drink
it
well
done
alpine
not
a
preferred
style
but
surely
have
room
for
this
one
pours
predominately
gold
with
some
orange
highlights
great
citrus
aroma
of
oranges
some
bread
and
grass
as
well
subtle
orange
taste
over
a
bready
malt
backbone
tastes
kind
of
candyfake
instead
of
fresh
oranges
some
honey
and
spice
similar
to
a
wit
refreshing
but
lacking
notes
from
12606
dgreat
summer
brew
to
replace
malternatives
nice
light
bouncy
and
flavourful
a
thirst
quencher
type
brew
not
recommended
a
very
boring
beer
all
around
d
i
found
this
to
be
average
for
my
taste
not
bad
just
didnt
hold
my
interest
for
more
than
one
taste
this
would
be
a
great
summer
drink
almost
like
orange
tea
cooler
w
the
citrus
flavor
meh
i
probably
would
have
appreciated
this
more
had
it
been
more
seasonal
the
next
time
i
try
this
ill
be
sure
that
its
the
summer
time
i
do
not
care
for
this
very
much
too
much
orange
flavor
and
not
enough
beer
anyone
remember
sunkist
probably
very
good
for
the
style
im
learning
that
i
am
not
a
fruitbeer
guy
this
beer
has
a
weird
bright
amber
orange
color
with
a
bunch
of
visible
carbonation
there
was
no
head
from
all
that
carbonation
though
im
not
sure
if
this
was
bottle
conditioned
but
there
were
a
bunch
of
floaties
in
there
also
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
spice
in
it
with
a
complementing
orange
aroma
i
might
be
crazy
but
i
also
smell
some
caramel
in
there
also
i
get
a
bunch
of
caramel
in
the
flavor
also
the
orange
really
takes
a
back
seat
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
nice
and
light
though
and
would
be
a
decent
summer
drink
d
enjoyable
beer
quite
refreshing
not
my
favorite
orange
beer
but
i
still
liked
it
a
lot
a
tasty
beer
one
of
the
better
orangeflavored
beers
ive
had
and
ive
had
my
share
pours
a
kight
brown
minimal
head
some
lacing
present
smell
is
dominated
by
an
orange
perfume
and
honey
which
i
suppose
it
should
for
an
orange
beer
taste
is
sweet
with
the
malt
hitting
you
upfront
followed
by
orange
peels
the
orange
oil
lingers
in
the
mouth
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
as
it
warms
a
spiciness
comes
through
that
was
masked
by
the
cold
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
soda
like
this
will
appeal
to
those
who
like
fruit
beers
but
it
may
just
be
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
one
should
be
enough
this
isnt
bad
for
a
novelty
i
just
dont
think
i
could
sit
here
downing
too
many
of
these
beer
is
good
happy
easy
going
beering
this
ale
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
tall
fluffy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
there
was
a
strong
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
strong
mandarin
orange
aroma
with
some
malt
the
taste
was
dominated
by
orange
flavor
but
there
was
also
a
good
maltiness
it
reminded
me
of
an
orange
milkshake
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
fruity
orange
and
malty
flavors
gave
this
a
nice
feel
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
seems
to
have
held
up
well
stored
at
room
temperature
perhaps
it
actually
improved
with
age
mandarin
nectar
is
the
first
alpine
beer
that
hasnt
either
blown
me
away
pure
hoppiness
or
impressed
me
greatly
alpine
ale
of
course
ive
only
had
those
two
theres
a
great
deal
of
potential
here
for
the
brewers
to
release
a
wonderfully
orange
fruity
beer
rather
than
the
less
than
inspired
one
that
occupies
my
glass
at
the
moment
drinkability
awesome
combinatino
of
flavor
and
quaffability
with
the
orange
flavor
you
could
drink
this
stuff
for
breakfast
and
be
happy
the
whole
day
mouthfeel
is
of
honey
and
tangerine
sweetness
light
orange
amber
small
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
chewable
orange
vitamins
a
strange
yeastiness
slight
bready
malts
and
nearly
nonexistant
hops
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
honey
and
medicinal
orange
mouthfeel
is
light
and
ok
and
drinkability
is
bad
sinkability

i
love
their
pure
hoppiness
but
this
tangy
medicinal
effort
by
alpine
beer
left
me
cold
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
but
carbonation
is
present
enough
to
keep
things
light
all
in
all
an
extremely
drinkable
very
tasty
beer
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
let
down
concitering
how
great
the
alpine
pure
hoppiness
is
it
poured
a
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
that
left
no
hint
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
hard
to
get
but
it
was
mostly
of
sweet
honey
and
a
hint
of
orange
the
flavor
was
average
at
best
with
a
big
sweet
malt
flavor
and
a
good
dose
of
honey
as
well
the
orange
flavor
was
quite
subdued
as
was
any
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
very
flat
and
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
non
offensive
beer
thoughmy
girlfriend
actually
liked
it
and
she
hates
all
beers
but
quite
borring
for
me
pass
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
first
feared
i
found
it
be
a
perfectly
acceptable
fruit
flavored
light
beer
not
overwhelming
nor
strong
on
tastes

more
of
a
light
honeyed
beer
with
a
hint
of
orange
i
rather
enjoyed
it
though
this
is
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
crystalline
amber
color
the
head
modest
and
off
white
in
color
the
lace
left
behind
a
nice
silky
covering
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
coriander
and
other
spices
and
of
course
oranges
along
with
the
malt
makes
a
nice
combo
fresh
and
crisp
quite
pleasant
with
the
start
ambrosial
nice
malt
presence
the
top
middling
finish
has
a
stinging
acidity
hops
are
delicate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
the
first
beer
ive
ever
tried
from
this
fine
brewery
and
a
quite
pleasant
beer
to
quaff
on
a
lazy
sunday
afternoon
thanks
to
xlperro
for
this
bottle
i
thought
that
this
tasted
medicinal
overall
45
had
at
pittsburgh
winter
beerfest
o
looked
good
smelled
not
so
good
i
found
it
to
taste
not
so
good
as
well
good
mouthfeel
overall
not
very
good
it
could
be
that
ive
never
had
good
mole
but
at
the
same
time
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
underwhelming
i
love
the
crap
out
of
xocoveza
and
some
other
offerings
of
a
similar
nature
but
this
beer
is
just
sad
in
comparison
the
peppery
flavor
is
there
but
nothing
else
supports
it
and
the
entire
beer
just
seems
to
fall
a
little
flat
in
the
area
of
flavor
o
a
distinct
beer
that
is
worth
trying
as
long
as
you
dont
completely
object
to
chilies
in
your
ale
allowed
to
warm
for
about
15
minutes
out
of
the
refridgerator
it
still
improved
with
further
warming
off
flavor
to
me
not
good
found
this
to
have
too
much
yeast
on
the
nose
and
palate
mouth
also
feels
way
too
thin
and
too
bubbly
for
what
the
flavors
are
doing
less
than
average
but
not
awful
would
not
try
again
popping
the
cap
reveals
a
tart
nose
scented
with
a
little
ripe
fruit
just
on
the
verge
of
getting
too
ripe
and
some
reconstituted
dried
dark
chilis
the
beer
pours
ruby
chestnut
under
a
1
white
foam
cap
that
dissipates
to
a
quick
film
the
palate
starts
tart
and
fruity
and
then
the
mexican
chocolate
flavors
come
forward
and
a
dried
chili
flavor
possibly
ancho
slight
smoke
a
green
chili
vegetal
taste
a
hint
of
coffee
a
very
light
tartness
suggesting
vinegar
and
pickled
green
chili
to
finish
with
a
touch
of
chili
heat
although
the
idea
of
the
beer
sounds
outrageous
everything
is
restrained
and
very
well
balanced
here
exquisitely
layered
and
deliciously
complex
without
getting
too
muddied
the
beer
contains
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
but
allows
each
to
speak
for
itself
the
beer
is
very
creamy
with
a
medium
full
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
smooth
and
not
harsh
mouthfeel
is
treacley
with
only
minor
notes
of
carbonation
initial
dominant
chocolate
swiftly
fades
into
a
subtle
hint
of
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
coffee
with
a
rising
tide
of
chiles
that
leaves
the
mouth
warm
and
tingling
and
lasts
long
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
with
notes
of
toffee
or
caramel
blending
in
and
creating
a
nighimperceptible
herbal
finish
o
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
again

for

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
not
sure
if
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
since
i
think
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
heavier
and
taste
more
of
the
chocolate
overall
massively
disappointed
not
sure
i
can
finish
it
and
i
never
dump
beer
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
for
the
mole
but
it
just
did
not
work
maybe
this
batch
is
different
from
past
batches
that
were
reviewed
more
positively
overall
it
is
better
than
ok
but
the
likelihood
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
one
again
is
small
but
decent
beer
from
an
awesome
brewery
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
the
mouthfeel
i
must
say
was
done
very
well
nearly
exactly
what
is
right
for
the
flavor
profile
the
flavor
however
while
overall
it
has
nice
individual
components
all
combined
together
it
is
not
really
something
i
found
all
that
appealing
it
was
a
very
good
one
to
give
a
try
to
but
nothing
i
would
go
back
to
again
and
again
reddish
brown
pour
had
a
small
amount
of
fizzy
carbonation
and
formed
a
fleeting
and
small
head
the
overall
look
was
very
similar
to
a
glass
of
coca
cola
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
cherry
in
it
along
with
the
fruit
were
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
showed
off
the
chocolate
a
lot
more
than
the
smell
the
dry
fruit
flavors
prune
raisins
dried
cherries
were
also
there
and
the
chiles
showed
up
strongest
in
the
finish
lots
of
complexity
here
along
with
similarity
to
the
mexican
sauce
this
beer
was
named
after
very
soft
in
the
mouth
with
a
velvety
texture
looking
at
the
other
reviews
this
beer
seems
to
me
underrated
to
me
theres
lots
of
smoothness
with
only
a
little
crispness
but
unvarying
it
leans
on
the
light
side
in
the
medium
body
its
semisweet
the
whole
way
through
almost
breaking
toward
semidry
in
the
finish
okay
i
guess
that
this
beer
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
mole
but
only
because
there
are
both
chile
and
chocolate
notes
but
beyond
that
there
is
not
much
to
evoke
the
complexity
and
depth
a
of
a
mole
far
too
thin
and
onenote
okay
two
note
the
chile
heat
is
at
the
right
level
but
the
chocolate
is
thin
and
watery
and
there
is
no
solid
malt
background
to
support
anything
and
no
other
spice
notes
to
play
off
of
the
chile
and
chocolates
a
nice
idea
for
a
beer
but
needs
some
retooling
o
i
made
the
mistake
of
taking
a
couple
toolarge
sips
and
it
wasnt
pleasant
with
all
the
sweetness
and
booze
but
treat
it
properly
and
there
are
rewards
to
be
had
ill
keep
my
theobroma
but
this
is
just
fine
not
a
bad
chili
beer
with
the
pepper
only
being
a
mild
component
to
a
big
malty
old
ale
overall
el
mole
ocho
is
a
unique
experience
it
is
the
most
complex
chili
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
and
i
think
i
prefer
it
to
theobroma
for
its
big
and
bold
flavors
what
a
bust
this
beer
falls
into
the
steer
clear
category
if
youre
looking
for
something
spicy
and
chocolatey
you
wont
find
it
here
really
digging
on
this
beer
daring
flavors
velvety
texture
great
balance
and
unique
my
one
complaint
is
that
i
would
like
more
chile
heat
but
thats
just
nitpicking
overall
very
interesting
and
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
my
only
real
gripe
is
the
lack
of
hop
balance
putting
some
bitter
sweet
hops
in
there
to
mix
with
the
chocolate
and
coco
flavors
would
have
put
this
beer
over
the
top
overall
too
much
for
one
person
hard
to
drink
the
full
22
oz
maybe
better
as
a
smaller
size
m
good
taste
and
aftertaste
warming
and
inviting
pours
a
brownishcopper
with
a
half
finger
of
head
the
dissipated
quickly
there
is
a
faint
touch
of
malt
in
the
nose
that
is
all
a
bit
sour
upfront
combined
with
light
chilli
pepper
heat
on
the
finish
a
nice
effort
but
finishing
this
offering
was
a
tad
difficult
o
interesting
but
the
aroma
was
quite
unpleasant
and
the
taste
wasnt
much
better
not
something
i
would
try
again
especially
at
this
age
o
i
guess
the
only
thing
i
have
to
really
compare
this
to
is
nb
cocoa
mole
which
was
excellent
and
much
sweeter
this
does
a
better
job
matching
the
flavor
but
isnt
as
good
of
a
beer
to
drink
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
i
believe
this
would
be
a
different
beer
interesting
but
nothing
great
in
its
current
state
this
enjoyable
beer
does
a
great
job
of
reminding
me
of
the
flavors
i
taste
in
the
first
couple
of
bites
of
a
mole
sauces
this
is
a
rich
complex
beer
with
that
strikes
a
balance
between
the
ingredients
of
cocoa
chile
pepper
coffee
and
malt
characteristics
bringing
those
flavors
together
and
makes
them
play
nice
overall
i
may
revisit
again
since
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
by
new
holland
even
better
than
the
2011
vintage
of
dragons
milk
worth
trying
if
you
like
mexican
mole
3

d
im
a
sucker
for
these
types
of
brews
this
is
a
good
one
but
better
ones
exist
still
worth
a
try
o
i
have
had
a
few
spiced
ales
some
of
which
i
have
immensily
enjoyed
others
that
i
found
to
be
complete
flops
the
more
i
drank
of
new
hollands
el
mole
ocho
the
more
i
liked
it
i
feel
that
a
good
spiced
ale
can
often
serve
as
an
excellent
after
dinner
beer
however
this
beers
more
subdued
balanced
less
syrupy
nature
makes
it
more
fit
to
pair
with
a
dish
of
spicy
pulled
pork
or
mexican
fare
interesting
brew
fruity
pepper
flavor
dominated
and
was
nicely
accompanied
by
sweet
chocolate
and
cinnamon
wouldnt
want
a
whole
bomber
though
my
first
chile
beer
had
this
on
draft
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
pours
reddish
brown
with
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
some
chile
peppers
tobasco
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
taste
is
not
pleasant
tobasco
sauce
mixed
with
a
mediocre
amber
ale
rather
thick
and
sweet
but
overall
the
chile
overpowers
really
funky
gave
it
a
chance
and
drank
most
of
the
pint
but
i
got
physically
ill
after
drinking
half
of
this
one
o
wanting
more
chocolate
and
chili
like
a
true
oaxacan
mole
interesting
but
once
is
enough
d
neat
idea
very
interesting
and
sort
of
daring
do
to
try
on
a
commercial
endeavor
and
they
pull
it
off
reasonably
well
it
has
a
pretty
simple
malt
profile
but
with
enough
umph
to
frame
the
beer
well
and
even
aged
it
has
a
nice
level
of
chili
heat
and
a
bit
of
flavor
i
imagine
it
was
more
forward
and
bold
when
fresh
but
even
nearly
a
year
old
it
is
pretty
good
a
well
done
chili
beer
clearly
a
sipper
here
one
to
savor
id
suggest
to
cook
and
pair
food
obviously
even
on
its
own
it
will
garner
some
conversation
long
live
extreme
beer
drinkability
suffers
from
the
hot
alcohol
notes
and
the
disappointing
mouthfeel
this
is
the
2010
vintage
and
im
thinking
it
definitely
helped
the
taste
and
flavor
and
subdued
the
sweet
notes
after
i
pooped
the
cap
it
said
malty
on
the
inside
quite
fitting
indeed
o
i
like
the
idea
of
a
mole
beer
but
this
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
too
sweet
and
not
balanced
enough
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
sliver
of
an
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
a
reddish
tinge
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
is
nice
cocoa
chocolate
malt
caramel
and
chili
very
balanced
and
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
profile
but
the
cocoa
and
chili
really
come
through
not
quite
as
good
as
the
nose
but
still
good
none
of
the
8
abv
comes
through
feel
is
medium
w
little
carbonation
and
a
little
heat
from
the
chili
id
like
a
little
more
malt
body
in
the
feel
overall
a
good
brew
that
has
a
couple
flaws
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cheers
not
a
favorite
but
not
a
bad
effort
either
i
like
that
the
8
4
thats
what
is
says
on
this
bottle
2011
vintage
props
up
the
chili
heat
with
neither
facet
overdoing
it
this
is
a
different
and
enjoyable
beer
that
is
more
subtle
than
you
might
expect
and
exhibits
way
more
balance
than
most
beers
made
with
chili
unique
and
enjoyable
all
the
way
interesting
its
a
nice
warmer

d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
with
well
integrated
molé
characteristics
to
create
a
spicy
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
the
scent
and
taste
and
the
body
was
nice
too
the
spice
helped
hide
the
alcohol
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
but
recommended
to
try
at
least
once
o
a
very
unique
beer
and
while
its
good
its
also
very
simple
true
to
its
name
it
tastes
like
a
mole
sauce
somehow
turned
into
a
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
at
nearly
9
for
a
bomber
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
overall
a
good
beer
a
little
on
the
sour
side
and
im
not
really
a
spicedbeer
person
i
prefer
spiced
wine
to
spiced
beer
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
those
who
were
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
no
lacing
this
lacing
pattern
seems
par
for
the
course
with
chili
beers
the
aroma
is
of
chili
peppers
with
a
backing
of
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
coffee
however
for
an
8
beer
it
is
rather
mild
the
taste
has
considerably
more
cocoa
and
coffee
than
the
aroma
with
the
chili
present
not
overpowering
anything
during
the
sip
it
comes
out
stronger
in
the
finish
and
leaves
some
nice
wanted
heat
i
really
like
this
beers
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
i
really
like
how
the
chili
is
well
integrated
into
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
that
must
be
tried
by
no
means
a
goto
beer
but
something
different
for
a
different
experience
try
this
with
a
spicy
chilli
like
meal
and
you
wont
be
dissaointed
would
not
recommend
especially
at
this
price
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
chili
borders
on
a
bit
too
much
but
never
quite
crosses
the
line
its
something
thats
worth
drinking
once
in
a
while
but
probably
too
something
maybe
onedimensional
maybe
distinctive
to
drink
regularly
tastesweet
malt
faint
coffeechocolate
note
faint
chili
pepper
pretty
thin

with
subdued
if
not
weak
flavors
more
of
everything
is
needed
here
except
the
sweetness
which
borders
on
cloying
disappointing
d
i
was
excited
to
try
this
but
fairly
disappointed
o
not
great
i
liked
it
but
was
glad
i
didnt
have
a
large
bottle
of
it
probably
wont
order
again
just
due
to
opportunity
cost
there
are
so
many
better
beers
even
though
this
one
is
a
good
spiced
beer
o
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
it
took
a
large
percentage
of
the
bottle
to
determine
if
i
liked
it
or
now
im
still
kind
of
on
the
fence
about
it
its
almost
like
a
chocolate
chili
stout
id
try
it
again
id
really
get
excited
about
having
a
fresh
one
to
compare
it
to
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
an
exotic
note
nice
dark
brown
color
and
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
pronounced
coco
nibs
and
unsweetened
chocolate
powder
aspect
slightly
astringent
and
drying
at
the
finish
i
was
unable
to
detect
any
pepper
flavors
to
speak
of
while
the
unsweetened
chocolate
notes
were
appropriate
for
a
moleinspired
beer
it
was
overall
fairly
onedimensional
simply
bizarre
chiles
in
a
bottle
possibly
mixed
with
beer
characteristics
not
bad
but
not
really
beer
bizarre
aroma
is
strong
with
an
overtone
of
quality
coffee
and
hints
of
cocoa
cinnamon
and
licorice
it
pours
a
luscious
semitransparent
mahogany
brown
with
an
average
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
flavor
is
malty
with
tones
of
coffee
cinnamon
caramel
and
licorice
and
a
hint
of
powdery
chocolate
texture
is
smooth
as
soymilk
yet
has
a
firm
tingle
and
a
bit
of
edginess
as
well
as
a
subtle
alcohol
bite
worthy
what
happened
to
the
first
seven
mole
beers
interesting
beer
thanks
joel
drinks
okay
with
a
little
finetuning
of
the
flavor
mix
this
could
be
a
very
good
unique
brew
pretty
good
as
is
feels
medium
to
full
in
body
a
little
dry
to
the
palate
and
warms
with
a
finish
from
the
chili
and
alcohol
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
id
say
that
it
is
pretty
drinkable
it
goes
down
quite
easy
i
was
honestly
hoping
for
a
more
peppery
bite
and
stronger
chocolate
notes
but
oh
well
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
pours
a
reddish
brown
topped
by
thin
offwhite
head
i
smell
dark
fruit
earth
maybe
some
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
l
the
taste
reveals
some
chocolate
fig
roasted
malts
little
hops
medium
to
full
body
with
good
carbonation
not
terrible
considering
i
dont
taste
mole
moleay
not
mole
but
this
isnt
very
drinkable
super
interesting
try
though
d
one
glass
is
good
i
did
not
find
this
very
drinkable
the
third
bad
beer
of
the
night
at
bodega
last
friday
thank
god
for
half
off
happy
hour
pours
a
moderatelydark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
nose
brings
some
light
chipotle
peppers
and
a
bit
of
might
smoke
the
taste
is
dried
chili
peppers
smoke
and
a
little
roast
light
heat
comes
through
interesting
but
not
all
that
tasty
d
this
beer
is
onedimensional
based
around
a
smoky
chipotle
pepper
smell
and
taste
there
really
are
no
other
characteristics
that
break
past
that
one
interesting
but
disappointing
d
interesting
for
sure
but
i
really
didnt
like
it
i
almost
didnt
want
to
review
it
drinkability
interesting
but
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
itd
be
could
use
more
malt
presence
your
usual
brown
ale
sort
of
beersoft
coppery
color
aroma
is
a
mild
mix
of
cocoajalapeno
and
somewhat
boozy
a
fair
amount
going
on
here
though
somewhat
muted
mildly
sour
upfront
lingering
flavors
of
cocoa
and
chiles
very
prevelent
honey
like
sweetness
nice
mouthfeelquite
smooth
quite
an
interesting
beer
but
the
overall
sweetness
and
melange
of
flavors
can
be
a
bit
much
sure
it
is
good
enough
but
lacks
a
bit
in
the
overall
drinkability
tasted
from
bottle
purchased
at
lush
west
town
pours
dark
clear
amber
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
on
the
outside
of
the
glass
aroma
is
green
jalapeno
bitter
chocolate
and
a
lot
of
coffee
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
flavor
starts
of
with
some
sweetness
and
cocoa
and
moves
to
jalapeno
and
then
bitter
coffee
all
of
these
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
to
create
a
very
unique
and
delicious
beer
the
body
is
fairly
heavy
and
coating
with
pretty
light
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
that
is
both
spicy
jalapeno
and
bitter
coffee
i
think
ill
pick
this
up
again
if
i
find
it
new
holland
is
a
very
solid
brewery
d
none
of
the
three
of
us
could
finish
our
split
due
to
the
strangeness
of
the
taste
it
just
became
too
overpowering
d
drinkable
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
but
this
is
pretty
unqiue
in
a
good
way
taste
takes
on
some
of
the
more
bitter
dark
chocoalate
flavors
which
some
might
prefer
personally
i
like
the
sweeter
chocolate
flavors
in
beer
decent
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
not
fantastic
but
worth
a
try
pretty
drinkable
once
you
get
past
the
inyourface
alcohol
smell
id
had
this
on
tap
before
and
it
was
served
too
cold
i
recommend
allowing
it
to
warm
before
drinking
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
what
i
expected
as
well
there
is
still
a
strong
medium
body
that
has
a
malty
stickiness
this
is
a
subtle
beer
the
spices
are
not
overwhelming
i
would
like
to
cook
with
this
beer
i
bet
it
would
make
a
great
base
for
a
mole
sauce
d
very
drinkable
despite
the
unusual
ingredients
this
i
believe
is
accomplished
through
the
brewers
avoidance
of
a
heavy
hand
with
these
flavors
nicely
done
notes
nice
ale
pivoting
on
its
mole
character
if
one
likes
that
touch
this
is
certainly
quite
the
brew
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
flavor
and
the
overall
experience
of
brew
pick
it
up
entirely
tried
this
at
savor
2010
poured
a
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
poor
retention
and
decent
lacing
smelled
of
chocolate
caramel
and
earthiness
as
well
as
pepper
and
other
spices
certainly
tasted
of
cocoa
powder
mixed
with
leaves
with
a
spicy
backbone
that
led
to
a
peppery
lingering
finish
not
as
thick
as
i
had
expected
this
to
be
but
still
fullbodied
nonetheless
with
modest
carbonation
decent
spicy
beer
but
too
unique
to
drink
on
its
own
definitely
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
suitably
spicy
chow
my
what
a
curious
beverage
i
imagine
some
think
its
a
wash
but
i
find
it
a
great
project
drinkability
ok
new
holland
continues
its
streak
of
hit
and
miss
with
el
mole
ocho
this
ones
more
of
a
miss
in
my
book
the
overall
flavors
alright
but
that
might
be
a
little
generous
its
somewhat
boozy
and
the
flavor
gets
old
somewhat
quick
i
guess
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
interested
but
thats
about
as
far
as
i
can
go
a
decent
layer
of
head
deep
amber
with
heavy
reds
in
the
beer
3
50
s
smells
strongly
like
barbeque
chicken
very
spicy
lots
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
dark
pitted
fruits
such
as
plums
i
also
pick
up
a
slight
dark
sweetness
like
raisins
or
molasses
3
00
t
noticeable
alcohol
burn
dates
and
figs
as
well
as
some
chocolate
dipped
raisins
slightly
syrupy
chilies
provide
a
mild
prickle
on
the
tongue
but
it
is
certainly
not
a
strong
flavor
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
skirt
the
edges
of
scotch
ale
to
chili
beer
3

medium
bodied
and
somewhat
silky
3

d
i
really
like
the
concept
of
this
beer
and
it
is
drinkable
but
it
just
didnt
click
with
my
palate
certainly
worth
a
try
3

ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
an
almost
opaque
black
that
shows
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
with
a
thin
khaki
head
aroma
is
slight
roasted
malts
not
much
else
the
taste
is
sharp
chilies
in
front
of
dark
malts
and
cocoa
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
mild
corporation
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
one
id
love
to
have
again
im
not
sure
of
the
translation
so
im
gonna
go
with
the
chocolate
eight
something
like
that
it
pours
a
pretty
much
clear
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
is
a
lambast
of
burnt
cocoa
backed
by
a
strange
melange
of
toasted
caramel
roasted
marshmallows
and
nicely
seered
salmon
something
here
just
doesnt
seem
right
the
taste
echoes
a
bit
starting
with
some
burnt
gingerbread
and
overdone
banana
bread
followed
by
some
caramelized
sugars
mole
sauce
just
as
advertised
i
guess
and
a
finish
of
smoked
nutmeg
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
cinnamon
i
have
no
idea
what
to
think
its
sorta
good
and
sorta
horrible
wow
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
strangely
dry
and
almost
sticky
finish
i
like
the
idea
behind
this
i
suppose
but
the
execution
was
thoroughly
botched
its
almost
drinkable
but
not
very
worth
a
try
if
for
nothing
else
than
bragging
about
the
experience
and
ticking
of
course
d
the
nougaty
flavors
really
overpower
everything
with
they
become
more
offensive
when
it
warms
it
started
out
as
an
interesting
beer
but
by
the
second
glass
i
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
it
novel
concept
but
i
just
dont
think
it
translated
from
paper
to
bottle
d
decent
but
i
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
expected
great
divides
chocolate
yeti
is
the
way
to
go
instead
of
this
beer
el
mole
ocho
reminds
me
a
lot
of
theobroma
but
with
a
sweeter
more
simplified
maltiness
thus
allowing
for
greater
separation
from
the
chili
and
spice
additions
coffee
colored
with
a
creamy
mocha
head
that
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
dark

and
fresh
roasted
coffee
in
the
aroma
with
some
chile
spice
notes
honey
dark
chocolate
and
warm
spice
with
a
coffee
like
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
smooth
with
high
carbonation
a
really
nice
and
different
brew
the
beer
pours
a
clear
redamber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
peppers
with
some
earth
dirt
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
fresh
green
peppers
jalapenos
or
serranos
with
some
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
overall
flavor
of
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
mess
but
i
liked
it
definitely
an
interesting
idea
from
the
brewers
at
new
holland
this
is
an
interesting
sipping
beer
that
is
best
shared
with
open
minded
and
palated
drinking
companions
dgood
beer
my
fault
i
picked
a
hot
day
to
drink
this
nice
balance
between
malty
and
chocolate
as
i
said
earlier
this
could
use
more
heat
otherwise
it
is
just
chocolate
still
very
nice
otherwise
another
quality
brew
from
new
holland
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
my
best
summary
of
this
would
be
a
double
vienna
lager
maltiness
meets
the
fruitiness
and
alcohol
content
of
a
double
bock
meets
the
spicy
twang
of
a
chili
beer
think
rogue
chipotle
definitly
doesnt
drink
like
your
typical
herbspiced
beer
which
is
a
good
thing
d
a
unique
beer
that
drinks
fairly
well
a
bit
sweet
but
unique
enough
to
be
memorable
overall
different
and
worth
trying
quite
an
interesting
beer
not
sure
ive
ever
had
anything
similar
the
aroma
is
very
earthy
like
combination
of
bread
and
malts
but
the
taste
is
very
different
from
the
aroma
taste
has
hints
of
mexican
chile
and
cayenne
peppers
but
blends
it
with
a
lingering
citrus
flavor
that
balances
out
and
ameliorates
the
spiciness
so
you
get
a
smooth
pleasant
taste
that
lingers
goes
down
very
smooth
especially
for
a
big
beer
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
tire
of
it
if
it
werent
for
its
big
alcohol
pretty
good
pretty
much
like
they
say
except
theres
a
notable
mineral
characteristic
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahoganey
aroma
is
cocoa
malt
mineral
and
a
little
ripe
dark
fruit
flavor
is
like
nose
but
a
hint
of
the
spice
added
but
not
as
much
as
expected
body
is
good
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
decent
and
of
medium
lenght
close
to
a
half
finger
of
dark
tan
color
the
bubbles
dont
seem
that
loosely
knit
but
the
heads
gone
in
a
few
seconds
there
is
a
little
stickiness
to
the
lacing
though
curiously
while
the
liquid
is
actually
fairly
clear
the
grimy
reddishbrown
color
more
reminiscent
of
claybased
mud
more
zinc
orange
hues
brighten
the
rims
huge
jelly
roll
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
dominates
the
nose
that
said
cumin
paprika
spices
present
along
with
a
tiny
pinch
of
cayenne
pepper
these
elements
occluded
by
bodacious
prune
plum
black
grape
raisin
black
cherry
fruit
scents
if
you
have
the
patience
you
might
be
able
to
get
some
charcoal
dust
and
peat
moss
overall
the
nose
gets
the
truth
in
advertising
award
visàvis
the
label
fullbodied
and
close
to
heavy
the
sheer
mass
of
it
pushes
the
carbonation
off
the
tongue
and
outwards
towards
your
cheeks
oodles
and
oodles
of
chocolate
accompanied
by
butterscotch
and
caramel
could
be
sold
in
the
candy
aisle
as
much
as
the
beer
aisle
the
mexican
spiciness
gets
sort
of
lost
in
the
shuffle
here
if
anything
more
heat
than
flavor
focus
teases
out
orange
citrus
granola
and
scone
notes
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
that
does
not
deviate
much
from
the
script
arguably
for
the
best
d
an
ok
spiced
beer
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
smell
but
the
taste
was
interesting
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
an
interesting

id
try
again

with
its
high

series
looking
forward
to
seeing
whats
next
in
this
series
really
quite
interesting
and
worth
trying
bought
a

of
this
in

after
trying
it
on

at

the

taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma

with
the
addition
of
a
bit
of

the

gets
slightly
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
but
even
then
the

isnt
really
strong
i
dont

the

mesh

very
well
for

reason
i
just
dont

for
the

of
this

i
dont

this

i
didnt

it

good
either
its
worth
trying
once
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
concept
but
unfortunately
i
didnt
think
the
flavors
were
quite
crisp
enough
to
completely
pull
it
off
still
its
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
its
a
bit
refreshing
to
sampler
a
beer
that
is
flavororiented
and
have
it
still
taste
like
beer
with
beer
traits
encompassing
the
intended
flavor
profile
and
leaving
the
spices
and
adjuncts
as
auxiliary
this
isnt
marinade
its
still
beer
and
delicious
beer
maybe
new
holland
can
send
a
rep
to
southern
tier
to
show
them
how
something
like
this
can
be
pulled
off
deftly
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bad
apple
a
dark
amber
color
but
very
clear
with
a
tan
head
kind
of
watery
not
much
retention
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
and
balanced
with
smoke
and
spice
really
makes
me
hungry
the
taste
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
its
ok
gives
you
the
smoke
and
spice
but
a
little
too
spicy
for
me
light
feel
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
very
rich
amber
colored
beer
it
has
an
extremely
present
smell
it
smells
like
nothing
else
i
have
ever
drank
rich
chocolate
spicy
malt
scent
the
taste
is
solid
with
a
rich
malt
strength
and
a
bit
of
hop
astringency
the
taste
doesnt
really
linger
nor
is
it
that
complex
with
the
aftertaste
it
is
a
delicious
beer
with
a
unique
taste
the
beer
is
too
flavorful
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
share
it
with
a
friend
drink
it
enjoy
it
have
fun
i
would
if
i
were
you
drinkability
would
be
good
if
it
had
a
better
flavor
d
it
is
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
but
it
doesnt
agree
with
my
taste
one
and
done
i
am
usually
not
this
negative
in
my
reviews
so
i
will
end
with
a
positive
i
am
happy
that
new
holland
is
doing
some
interesting
experimental
beers
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
particular
beer
to
see
how
it
turned
out
22oz
brown
bomber
served
in
a
blvd
tank
7
tulip
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
aroma
of
chocolate
green
pepper
and
chiles
medium
bodied
more
chile
peppers
and
chocolate
in
the
flavor
some
vegetal
green
pepper
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
interesting
beer
but
a
12oz
bottle
would
have
been
enough
worth
trying
572010
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
brilliant
garnet
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
off
white
head
that
settles
into
a
creamy
mass
atop
the
aromas
are
a
mix
of
earthbitter
chocolateand
ripe
chilisnot
much
sweetness
is
present
i
have
to
say
the
flavors
grew
on
meat
first
i
thought
it
to
be
a
bit
one
sided
in
its
roastydrier
tones
but
after
awhile
the
roasted
chili
flavor
mixed
with
the
bitter
chocolate
seemed
to
meld
together
betterthe
chili
flavor
really
comes
thru
in
the
finish
its
different
and
thats
a
good
thing
hereit
takes
some
adjusting
to
but
its
pretty
good
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
worth
trying
d
i
bought
this
for
novelty
purposes
not
expecting
to
think
much
of
it
what
a
pleasant
surprise
still
im
glad
i
had
help
with
the
bomber
22
ounces
would
have
been
a
bit
much
the
color
is
a
combination
of
brown
garnet
and
a
touch
of
orange
no
haze
in
this
one
i
was
really
expecting
something
a
little
more
substantial
you
can
smell
a
subtle
pepper
aroma
but
with
the
chocolate
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
of
chipotle
pepper
as
one
who
enjoys
all
things
hot
this
had
less
heat
than
i
was
hoping
for
however
the
subtle
warmth
left
in
the
mouth
was
very
tasty
the
cocoa
was
there
on
the
front
but
id
have
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
prominent
this
had
some
great
characteristics
but
it
was
just
a
little
toned
down
for
me
i
do
kind
of
like
this
beer
but
only
for
the
sake
of
having
tried
it
in
its
uniqueness
and
perhaps
creativity
i
do
not
however
find
it
very
drinkable
as
it
is
a
little
too
heavy
and
the
flavors
trend
on
the
rich
and
out
of
the
norm
like
mole
its
not
for
everyone
but
unique
and
worth
its
existence
in
the
world
interesting
but
not
necessarily
good
i
wont
be
hunting
this
one
down
again
anytime
soon
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
while
we
in
the
area
and
im
interested
to
see
how
it
compares
i
think
that
the
cask
conditioning
might
have
actually
hindered
this
some
as
it
seemed
to
mute
the
flavors
a
bit
and
showed
a
little
more
alcohol
than
i
would
have
expected
interesting
stuff
that
im
willing
to
give
a
second
try
this
is
not
a
very
enjoyable
drink
i
dont
want
any
more
after
splitting
the
bomber
d
not
exactly
a
beer
youd
want
a
lot
of
i
think
it
might
work
with
some
smoky
cheese
or
perhaps
a
pepper
crusted
steak
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
really
drinkable
in
the
long
run
i
will
buy
some
more
of
this
just
to
see
how
some
age
will
treat
it
drinkability
suffered
from
the
finish
with
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
and
the
heat
of
the
peppery
quality
neither
was
particularly
strong
but
they
didnt
pull
me
back
for
another
sip
interesting
no
doubt
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
something
really
different
id
just
recommend
splitting
one
about
23
ways
all
in
all
this
brew
is
not
worth
hunting
down
you
can
try
if
you
have
access
and
enjoy
some
good
sours
but
otherwise
avoid
d
this
one
is
crazy
and
unique
i
have
only
had
mole
a
few
times
but
i
would
say
this
beer
pulls
off
the
flavor
as
good
as
a
beer
could
i
enjoy
the
flavor
combination
but
the
sweetness
gets
intense
after
a
while
drinkability
not
good
a
few
sips
were
plenty
for
me
sink
got
the
rest
taste
dried
peppers
definitely
coming
through
still
kinda
fruity
but
not
dominant
like
in
the
smell
finishes
fairly
dry
mouthfeel
is
moderatetothick
and
the
spice
gives
this
a
bit
of
a
stinging
sensation
on
the
tongue
overall
i
find
this
a
quite
decent
beer
maybe
not
made
exactly
to
my
tastes
id
like
a
bit
more
chocolate
here
giving
this
a
more
stoutlike
character
but
its
almost
certainly
the
beer
that
the
good
folks
at
new
holland
wanted
to
make
decent
drinkability
the
sweet
aspect
knocks
it
down
a
notch
or
two
otherwise
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
md
this
brew
is
a
bit
big
for
its
style
thick
and
fullbodied
its
not
meant
to
be
sipped
by
itself
definitely
a
food
beer
its
very
good
but
needs
something
to
go
with
it
taste
is
deliciously
balanced
rum
raisins
and
molasses
with
cocoa
chile
pepper
and
sticky
toffee
sweet
and
sticky
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
quaff
alongside
small
bars
terrific
chili
drinkability
more
than
a
sipper
but
too
many
flavors
to
go
down
easy
i
cant
imagine
drinking
anything
before
or
after
this
seems
to
overwhelm
any
prior
tastes
and
wrecks
the
palate
for
anything
subtle
after
delicious
complex
beer
that
has
its
time
and
place
taste
starts
with
a
peppery
kick
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
notes
follow
spicy
pepper
stays
as
cantaloupe
candied
banana
and
figs
provide
a
little
muted
sweetness
smoky
throughout
finish
is
a
nice
mix
of
peppery
spice
chocolate
and
fruit
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
a
very
interesting
beer
but
not
one
i
would
drink
very
often
nice
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
radler
but
this
was
pretty
good
overall
very
enjoyable
and
not
overly
sweet
perfectly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
plenty
of
flavor
available
as
well
tall
boy
can
i
was
fairly
convinced
this
would
be
horrible
but
its
not
that
bad
this
is
not
to
say
that
its
particularly
good
if
i
hadnt
known
this
was
lemon
tea
i
might
not
have
noticed
those
flavors
but
they
are
definitely
there
albeit
subtle
the
tea
is
in
the
initial
taste
while
the
finish
is
a
standard
somewhat
aqueous
lager
pours
a
clear
gold
colour
with
a
nice
chunky
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
nothing
leaving
behind
no
lace
smells
of
iced
tea
lemon
and
wheat
beer
apparently
they
used
a
blend
of
orange
pekoe
and
earl
grey
to
make
this
beer
i
could
taste
the
earl
grey
reminded
me
of
when
i
drank
earl
grey
tea
as
a
kid
because
of
jean
luc
picard
in
star
trek
strong
lemon
aroma
with
some
grainy
malts
and
tea
leaves
tastes
a
little
stronger
than
it
smells
like
someone
mixed
in
lemon
iced
tea
with
a
rather
boring
hefeweizen
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
then
again
i
could
also
have
an
iced
tea
after
mowing
the
lawn
as
well
would
i
drink
it
again
if
it
were
offered
would
i
buy
it
again
no
excellent
beer
on
the
whole
super
refreshing
and
very
tasty
if
you
like
beer
and
tea
this
is
a
no
brainer
coors
light
iced
t
can
eat
its
heart
out
the
carbonation
is
average
the
body
light
would
make
a
great
hot
weather
summer
drink
pours
a
hazy
maize
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strong
earl
grey
tea
slight
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
fits
the
style
of
a
herbed
spiced
beer
tastes
of
strong
tea
slight
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
body
since
this
was
a
tea
beer
the
domination
of
tea
in
body
and
aroma
was
very
pleasing
i
also
enjoyed
the
distinct
and
discernible
flavor
of
the
earl
grey
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
light
but
decent
flavors
and
aromas
awesome
to
see
this
as
part
of
the
summer
mixed
pack
for
2012
this
is
a
very
unique
summer
beer
that
uses
the
tea
notes
and
the
lemon
in
a
balanced
and
understated
way
you
can
tell
its
a
wheat
beer
but
the
tea
flavours
add
some
depth
and
dryness
and
the
lemon
adds
a
citrus
note
to
the
finish
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
long
finish
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
as
the
days
get
hotter
overall
a
great
summer
sipper
by
mill
street
the
unique
tea
flavours
make
this
beer
one
of
a
kind
im
pleased
that
the
lemon
and
sweetness
levels
are
well
balanced
and
not
overpowering
session
worthy
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
its
a
great
summer
beer
thats
more
interesting
than
your
average
lager
had
good
carbonation
and
was
easy
to
drink
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
to
try
different
refreshing
flavourful
but
a
bit
too
much
like
iced
tea
for
my
liking
o
it
was
a
neat
experiment
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
heat
but
overall
its
not
my
thing
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
o
an
interesting
brew
however
somewhat
unbalanced
still
plenty
drinkable
d
decent
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
something
different
and
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
worth
revisiting
overall
very
interesting
beer
here
from
a
very
quality
ontario
craft
brewery
i
know
its
not
your
average
beer
and
i
havent
seen
any
other
lemon
tea
beers
out
there
and
i
make
trips
down
to
the
states
monthly
but
for
how
out
there
this
beer
may
be
it
is
something
that
you
probably
dont
want
to
miss
especially
for
you
lemon
and
tea
lovers
this
is
a
no
brainer
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
to
sit
down
on
my
patio
and
drink
it
during
a
hot
summer
night
congrats
mill
st
yet
again
another
very
quality
beer
you
keep
showing
us
ontarioins
what
youre
really
made
of
overall
very
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
flavours
work
much
better
together
than
i
would
have
expected
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
people
either
love
or
hate
and
i
think
i
tend
toward
the
former
if
youre
a
purist
and
dont
like
the
taste
of
tea
or
fruit
in
your
beer
you
probably
shouldnt
bother
with
this
without
those
pretensions
though
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
and
is
worth
a
try
pour
yields
a
murky
light
golden
beer
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
lemon
and
not
too
much
tea
maybe
a
slight
herbal
character
hint
of
toffee
the
flavor
reveals
a
strong
diacetyl
presence
the
lemon
is
completely
covered
up
no
bueno
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bad
with
a
thick
buttery
character
mild
carbonation
yuck
im
surprised
that
this
is
4
9
abv
from
the
light
taste
interesting
and
alternative
beer
but
doesnt
have
enough
kick
to
it
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
check
it
out
otherwise
its
nothing
special
overall
this
beer
is
getting
a
35
worth
a
try
would
say
but
up
to
you
ultimately
whether
its
your
thing
or
not
neat
idea
and
props
to
a
great
canadian
craft
brewery
mill
st
poured
a
filtered
golden
amber
with
3
or
so
fingers
of
fluffy
head
that
fades
as
fast
as
it
appeared
a
thin
ring
of
head
remains
no
lacing
and
no
retention
nose
has
some
lemony
and
grassy
hops
loads
of
lemon
tea
surprise
surprise
a
general
sweetness
to
it
and
darker
almost
earl
greylike
herbal
notes
taste
is
super
fizzy
initially
again
some
thin
and
watery
lemon
tea
sweet
malt
and
very
mild
hops
some
tea
leafiness
in
the
finish
mouth
was
thin
and
watery
super
high
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
horrible
and
definitely
suited
to
the
summer
patio
lemon
tea
for
sure
and
ill
give
it
a
little
more
credit
for
nailing
that
if
unspectacularly
drinkability
is
bad
looked
okay
and
smelled
nice
enough
but
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
overall
not
feeling
it
i
guess
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
groan
this
one
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summer
and
a
good
beer
for
any
old
time
the
lemon
tea
beer
from
mill
street
brewery
is
quite
drinkable
avoiding
being
too
sweet
or
having
an
overpowering
or
unnatural
taste
to
it
di
want
to
drink
these
all
day
at
the
beach
not
what
id
reach
for
all
winter
but
still
great
as
an
afterwork
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
nice
change
of
taste
in
a
beer
drinkability
something
different
to
try
i
would
not
go
out
and
get
it
again
but
was
happy
to
have
sampled
mediumlight
body
but
lightly
carbonated
i
think
that
more
carbonation
might
help
but
the
lemon
probably
kills
it
minor
quibble
drinkability
is
good
makes
a
refreshing
summer
wheat
overall
a
nice
take
on
a
wheat
beer
a
field
dominated
by
wtf
oddities
drink
another
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
points
for
originality
i
can
see
how
it
may
appeal
to
some
especially
on
warm
days
but
it
is
not
my
style
of
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
though
i
could
see
lots
of
people
loving
this
beer
on
a
summer
day
but
its
a
little
and
weird
and
not
what
i
would
think
of
when
im
thinking
beer
sorta
like
someone
added
some
lemon
to
that
snowfresh
beer
but
watered
it
doen
slightly
for
what
its
intended
for
the
patio
in
summer
not
that
i
would
know
after
this
year
its
a
refreshing
take
on
our
favorite
beverage
very
approachable
yet
nothing
remarkable
no
off
flavours
though
hot
summer
weather
lawnmower
beer
at
best
and
it
would
do
the
job
well
in
that
aspect
copper
looking
beer
and
slightly
hazed
even
though
i
did
swirl
the
can
after
pouring
23rd
of
it
the
head
looks
creamy
but
disappear
quickly
the
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
from
citrus
and
tea
couldnt
expect
anything
else
this
is
actually
not
bad
and
it
is
inviting
on
the
taste
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
but
actually
a
lemon
tea
it
is
very
refreshing
and
it
feels
like
drinking
a
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
very
high
drinkability
on
this
one
the
taste
is
not
off
putting
too
so
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
during
an
evening
watching
football
or
a
movie
however
this
is
the
ultimate
beer
for
an
afternoon
at
the
park
d
torn
on
this
if
you
can
get
past
the
fact
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
than
sure
give
er
easy
to
drink
though
while
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
if
i
wanted
a
beer
this
is
a
very
thirst
quenching
and
enjoyable
summer
drink
i
would
hope
that
itd
attract
many
new
nonbeer
drinkers
to
the
craft
beer
world
d
hits
the
spot
and
its
very
accurate
to
the
name
unoffensive
by
any
means
i
would
actually
put
ice
cubes
in
this
one
the
more
beerlike
version
of
a
long
island
iced
tea
this
is
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
label
lemon
tea
beer
if
you
dont
like
real
ice
tea
then
saty
away
this
is
a
beer
for
a
mood
if
you
want
to
sit
back
on
a
sweltering
day
and
have
some
ice
tea
with
a
kick
then
this
is
absolutely
perfect
f
what
you
really
wanted
was
a
beer
then
have
your
beer
i
like
this
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
want
it
to
replace
beery
beer
but
it
is
hitting
the
spot
on
a
43c
august
evening
in
swampy
ottawa
d
good
drinkability
m
a
medium
lasting
ending
not
really
incredible
with
a
bitter
and
dry
feeling
at
the
end
body
is
light
and
drinkability
is
a
good
while
not
first
choice
on
a
patio
there
is
some
appeal
there
and
all
things
being
equal
i
think
mill
st
have
done
a
bang
up
job
with
this
one
its
not
bad
worth
a
shot
pale
amber
orange
in
colour
very
lightly
hazy
its
thin
head
fizzles
out
fast
aroma
of
lemon
and
tea
with
a
slight
floral
edge
to
it
and
a
mild
beeriness
in
the
background
the
packaging
promises
you
it
will
taste
like
lemon
and
tea
and
delivers
on
that
promise
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
its
a
bit
tangy
from
the
lemon
and
wheat
malt
it
has
mild
tannic
finish
that
any
tea
drinker
will
recognize
its
light
refreshing
easy
drinking
and
tastes
very
natural
it
may
not
taste
like
beer
but
it
delivers
on
what
it
promises
to
taste
like
it
seems
well
made
in
that
respect
this
is
no
highly
processed
and
artificial
tasting
alcopop
its
definately
not
bud
light
lime
or
miller
chill
either
though
it
might
appeal
to
the
same
demographics
it
doubt
it
would
appeal
to
the
geeks
a
quality
summer
quencher
with
mass
appeal
interesting
but
not
something
id
go
looking
for
not
quite
in
the
same
league
as
a
proper
fruit
beer
clear
gold
with
a
decent
head
of
foam
honey
tea
lemoncitrus
dominate
the
nose
flavour
has
a
bit
more
general
beeriness
with
a
wheaty
twang
fairly
honeysweet
and
tea
flavour
is
understated
tea
and
herbal
hops
mix
nicely
definitely
interesting
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
strong
points
of
this
brew
are
balance
and
drinkability
good
summer
beer
that
has
a
bit
more
oomph
final
thoughts
another
solid
offering
by
the
folks
at
mill
st
who
are
probably
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
ontario
i
think
honestly
if
they
brought
this
down
to
about
4
5
or
4
2
abv
and
maybe
gave
it
a
bit
more
sweet
malt
it
would
be
a
thing
of
exceptional
greatness
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
very
refreshing
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
still
a
good
summer
beer
nonetheless
if
i
wanted
an
alcoholic
beverage
that
didnt
taste
like
beer
booze
why
drink
then
i
would
get
a
cooler
if
i
wanted
a
beer
i
wouldnt
want
this
either
not
a
bad
seasonal
from
mill
st
certainly
better
than
i
had
expected
but
probably
not
something
ill
pick
up
on
a
regular
basis
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
night
worth
a
try
though

this
beer
has
huge

appeal
curious
and
interesting
well
done
for
what
it
is
and
above
average
refreshment
value
the
mouthfeel
has
a
cleansing
quality
to
it
but
a
slight
artificial
feel
as
well
a
saccharine
element
of
sorts
that
keeps
it
from
being
an
exemplary
beer
still
it
is
far
superior
to
those
coolers
out
there
that
pretend
to
be
what
theyre
not
overall
this
beer
experiment
works
just
fine
and
id
recommend
you
try
it
you
might
well
want
to
have
this
on
hand
for
a
patio
or
pool
party
this
summer
it
would
be
a
big
hit
in
mixed
company
bravo
to
mill
st
for
making
the
effort
a
unique
experiment
but
not
something
i
would
rave
about
a
few
tweaks
could
make
this
quite
nice
though
not
impressed
no
body
to
speak
of
dvery
drinkable
i
was
almost
completely
done
my
can
when
i
was
done
my
review
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
orange
and
tea
is
more
dominant
then
expected
and
very
unique
taste
is
quite
intense
with
lots
of
notes
of
tea
and
orange
with
a
bland
malt
bill
body
is
slightly
fuller
then
i
would
have
expected
with
good
carbonation
i
must
admit
that
this
was
a
more
intense
experience
then
i
was
expecting
and
even
now
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
try
this
often
thought
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
a
bad
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
nor
lacing
it
smells
like
lemon
herbal
tea
if
i
had
my
eyes
closed
i
would
think
this
was
lemon
hearbal
tea
not
beer
taste
has
lots
of
the
lemon
tea
with
a
little
bitterness
and
some
sour
lemon
flavour
nice
carbonation
level
if
you
like
lemon
tea
im
sure
youd
like
this
but
it
is
too
one
dimensional
i
still
could
see
this
being
a
hit
for
mill
street
i
just
dont
have
plans
to
buy
anymore
d
pretty
easy
drinking
reminding
me
of
the
white
beers
that
have
become
popular
in
canada
in
the
last
couple
years
would
make
a
nice
summer
patio
beverage
d
i
must
say
that
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
one
my
expectations
were
not
all
that
high
but
they
well
exceeded
those
although
rather
bland
on
the
appearance
and
scent
the
flavour
came
through
for
the
win
d
flies
down
the
hatch
in
no
time
a
first
class
example
of
the
style
and
probably
my
highestrated
fruit
beer
nice
work
mill
street
really
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
its
incredibly
drinkable
that
said
its
not
something
ill
repeat
as
a
good
lemony
hefe
or
crisp
pilsner
is
more
my
summertime
thing
but
according
to
the
back
of
the
bottle
this
will
come
in
cans
this
summer
and
i
might
have
to
keep
a
small
stash
in
my
fridge
for
visitors
who
say
they
dont
like
beer
this
might
change
their
mind
if
mill
street
was
aiming
for
the
perfect
summer
beer
they
hit
it
almost
spot
on
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
in
the
loose
bin
allowing
me
to
not
commit
to
the
mixed
6
but
with
their
pilsner
thrown
in
id
say
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
in
terms
of
their
bottled
beer
id
say
this
one
sits
on
par
with
the
best
mill
street
has
to
offer
tastes
something
like
a
3070
mix
of
iced
tea
to
beer
i
honestly
think
that
if
i
had
never
tried
tornado
i
would
have
a
different
opinion
of
this
beer
for
what
was
intended
its
a
good
effort
just
not
one
that
im
entirely
appreciating
i
could
see
lots
of
this
stuff
being
consumed
this
summer
but
dont
think
ill
be
helping
out
with
that
if
i
want
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
in
toronto
ill
grab
a
denisons
i
have
to
admit
that
before
trying
it
i
thought
the
only
thing
a
lemon
tea
beer
would
prove
is
that
some
things
are
better
left
alone
boy
was
i
wrong
this
is
an
exceptionally
refreshing
ale
that
is
perfectly
suited
to
warmweather
drinking
provided
the
sound
of
this
beer
sounds
remotely
appealing
to
you
then
i
guarantee
it
will
be
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
was
skeptical
at
first
about
this
but
after
having
it
a
couple
times
it
is
pretty
damn
good
edit
just
got
back
from
volo
the
humidex
is
at
40
and
ive
got
to
say
this
is
the
perfect
summer
seasonal
drinkability
through
the
roof
in
the
weather
its
intended
for
ive
upped
the
drinkability
to
5
a
very
good
approximation
of
when
lemonflavoured
black
tea
and
a
plainass
stock
ale
collide
im
duly
glad
that
the
earl
greys
bergamot
oil
which
im
altogether
less
than
partial
towards
is
well
obfuscated
by
the
lemon
and
equally
buoyed
by
the
workaday
my
days
usually
orange
pekoe
in
the
mix
a
decent
summer
quaff
overall
d
i
could
see
people
drinking
this
on
a
patio
on
tap
at
cest
what
spring
festival
of
craft
brewers
average
beer
yellow
with
lots
of
lace
middlemouthfeel
drinkable
yeah
some
lemon
black
tea
taste
if
i
want
that
i
will
get
my
unsweetened
snapple
probably
some
will
like
it
a
novelty
really
a
fruit
beer
might
be
better
with
honey
i
do
put
honey
in
my
tea
this
is
an
excellent
straightforward
summer
sipper
its
light
in
taste
but
interesting
with
the
understated
tea
flavors
very
easy
to
quaff
another
winner
from
torontos
best
brewpub
overall
decent
change
of
pace
works
best
as
a
summer
night
beer
not
as
sweet
as
id
anticipated
worth
a
look
a
very
unique
flavor
to
this
beer
i
must
confess
that
i
do
no
detect
any
ginger
at
all
which
makes
me
wonder
whether
i
got
a
defective
bottle
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
smoky
forms
a
huge
head
even
when
poured
carefully
lovely
color
the
flavor
is
smoky
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
slight
burn
indicative
of
the
gingers
presence
overall
i
like
the
taste
of
ginger
and
this
beer
features
the
spice
in
all
its
glory
if
you
do
not
like
ginger
stay
away
the
ginger
mixes
well
with
the
base
of
a
pale
malt
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
find
it
to
be
one
of
atlantics
better
small
bottle
beers
o
completely
fresh
and
untainted
this
beer
retains
a
refreshing
fruity
note
along
with
a
malty
yet
light
foundation
with
a
touch
of
spicy
ginger
this
bottle
has
some
of
that
still
intact
though
its
been
first
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
summer
of
07
brought
home
a
sixpack
its
just
a
pleasant
twist
on
the
standard
lightcrisp
blondewheat
summer
ale
had
this
beer
while
on
vacation
in
bar
harbor
main
after
hiking
all
day
stumbled
across
this
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
i
love
the
taste
has
a
fruity
smell
cloudy
amber
color
and
a
slight
hint
of
ginger
i
thought
it
was
good
enough
to
have
my
local
liquer
store
order
me
a
case
o
easy
to
drink
but
i
really
wish
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
fresh
ginger
were
more
prevalent
more
spicy
and
more
intense
refreshing
and
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
the
beer
was
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
and
it
was
a
bright
hazy
orangegold
coloring
with
a
filmy
foamy
white
head
nose
of
subtle
ginger
and
toast
flavors
of
sweet
gingerbread
with
a
roastytoasty
highlight
lemony
ginger
aftertaste
with
a
cookie
character
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
frothy
clean
finish
very
good
brew
the
taste
is
gingerforward
as
to
be
expected
there
is
a
milder
pale
malt
note
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
it
does
have
a
slight
bite
that
the
5
2
abv
would
not
suggest
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
not
for
regular
drinking
caramelcolored
ale
with
a
thin
head
and
yellow
highlights
subtle
flavors
of
ginger
and
yeast
and
do
i
detect
molasses
has
flavors
of
grass
and
yeast
with
a
nice
ginger
kick
the
ginger
flavor
is
odd
but
not
overpowering
im
a
big
fan
of
unique
brews
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
at
first
but
it
breaks
down
as
you
get
used
to
it
and
it
has
a
sort
of
tart
finish
the
ginger
taste
really
makes
it
a
refreshing
drink
this
would
be
a
nice
one
for
a
day
that
was
about
60
degrees
warmer
than
today
cheers
overall
quite
the
enjoyable
brew
certainly
will
be
having
this
one
again
i
see
this
being
paired
well
with
seafood
or
asian
inspired
foods
the
mouthfeel
is
fortunately
not
watery
and
while
by
no
mean
strong
or
heavy
could
easily
be
lighter
it
tends
toward
spritziness
but
doesnt
fall
too
far
taste
is
good
you
can
taste
the
ginger
but
it
is
not
overpowering
beer
has
pleasant
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
is
about
average
overall
beer
is
pretty
good
and
a
nice
specialty
beer
overall
grade
c
just
bland
and
boring
pours
a
fizzy
apricot
color
hazy
with
a
tight
champagne
like
head
that
settles
to
nothing
raisin
dried
fruit
nose
herbal
bitter
spicy
taste
followed
by
a
rush
of
water
soaked
hay
candied
ginger
after
taste
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
could
save
this
for
fans
of
the
style
couldnt
save
it
for
me
theres
actually
a
nice
ginger
bite
as
it
warms
but
the
straw
after
taste
totally
ruins
this
for
me
i
think
it
could
work
better
in
a
different
style
maybe
a
ginger
pale
ale
overall
fairly
meh
plenty
of
off
flavors
sweet
and
syrupy
with
an
extract
like
wheat
flavor
that
im
still
not
sure
if
it
is
extract
or
just
very
poorly
done
wheat
beer
the
ginger
is
barely
there
and
some
phenols
that
dont
belong
pretty
easy
and
interesting
sessionable
brew
the
ginger
is
a
welcome
spiced
flavor
that
is
not
overdone
its
there
but
it
complements
the
beer
flavors
instead
of
overriding
them
definitely
worth
trying
and
as
a
fan
of
ginger
i
would
think
you
couldnt
hope
for
much
better
than
this
out
of
a
ginger
spiced
beer
overall
it
seems
like
others
said
as
a
basic
wheat
ale
with
a
bit
of
ginger
added
not
enough
to
really
notice
but
not
too
little
to
make
this
offensive
i
am
glad
i
tried
an
actual
ginger
beer
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
tastes
like
a
summer
ale
with
a
twist
of
ginger
i
might
have
one
if
offered
but
one
would
be
enough
i
really
wanted
more
giner
than
this
verdict
i
picked
this
up
because
it
looked
like
something
a
little
different
try
and
i
was
right
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
before
in
terms
of
ginger
and
the
spices
that
work
alongside
of
it
good
to
try
once
but
i
would
not
invest
any
more
into
it
d
the
suspended
material
does
frighten
me
a
bit
but
otherwise
the
macro
spiced
beer
flavor
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
the
5
2
abv
and
sweet
light
summery
spiced
flavors
might
endear
some
but
there
are
far
better
styles
and
beers
out
there
than
can
accomplish
this
task
and
so
much
more
d
i
like
this
beer
seems
like
a
decent
summer
offering
to
me
d
i
couldnt
drink
the
whole
bottle
the
ginger
kept
building
up
on
itself
and
the
carbonation
did
little
to
scrup
some
of
the
flavor
off
the
tongue
however
i
did
not
get
to
drink
it
completely
cold
as
i
should
have
as
it
warmed
it
seemed
to
get
skunky
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
while
eating
chinese
food
the
flavors
may
pair
up
better
what
shall
i
do
with
the
other
4
mount
desert
island
ginger
is
a
cloudy
deep
golden
ale
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
it
has
a
lightly
sweet
malty
aroma
it
has
a
smooth
mediumlight
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
finish
it
has
a
simple
light
malty
flavor
with
a
soft
spicy
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
ginger
is
so
subtle
that
i
dont
think
id
detect
it
if
i
hadnt
read
the
bottle
its
pleasant
and
not
really
standout
a
casual
session
ale
terrible
this
beer
was
really
gross
perhaps
i
just
had
an
old
bottle
because
the
average
for
this
beer
was
pretty
high
there
wasnt
much
ginger
flavor
at
all
just
a
musty
lager
with
a
little
after
spice
to
it
i
could
only
drink
a
few
sips
i
think
i
was
expecting
like
a
reeds
ginger
ale
with
alcohol
i
woudnt
order
this
again
poured
from
bottle
into
sam
adams
drinking
glass
amber
color
decent
head
lots
of
particles
overall
not
a
bad
unfiltered
wheat
beer
but
i
expected
more
ginger
flavor
could
be
because
these
bottles
appear
to
have
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
or
on
tap
somewhere
first
impression
is
how
dry
the
beer
is
this
is
not
an
overwhelmingly
strong
ginger
ale
the
ginger
really
only
shows
up
on
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
short
the
liquid
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
typical
ale
i
give
them
an
a
for
attempt
but
an
e
for
effort
this
beer
is
just
not
very
enjoyable
that
odd
bitter
flavor
long
finish
and
strange
aftertaste
just
doesnt
work
for
me
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
it
forms
a
voluminous
head
that
subsides
quickly
typical
cloudiness
of
a
wheat
beer
and
no
strong
impressions
from
the
smell
the
taste
is
again
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
with
some
additional
spiciness
the
ginger
is
not
strong
but
is
clearly
present
it
is
somewhat
astringent
in
the
mouth
and
has
an
aftertaste
that
is
more
characteristic
of
pickled
ginger
than
of
beer
this
is
not
a
ginger
beer
in
the
style
of
true
ginger
beers
i
have
tasted
in
the
south
it
is
a
light
summer
domestic
wheat
beer
with
some
added
spice
i
agree
with
many
other
reviewers
that
the
flavoring
is
not
distinct
not
crisp
i
did
not
find
it
unpleasant
overall
and
was
willing
to
enjoy
the
second
bottle
occasional
beer
consumers
who
like
corona
might
find
this
a
tad
more
interesting
but
beer
aficionados
are
likely
to
seek
something
that
better
represents
the
brewers
art
i
do
not
expect
to
purchase
this
one
again
d
hard
to
imagine
drinking
this
in
multiples
less
then
average
enjoyment
and
ease
of
consumption
it
is
what
it
is
a
ginger
beer
that
comes
off
overbearingly
sweet
malt
wise
limiting
multiples
or
repeatability
if
curious
try
lefthands
ginger
over
this
otherwise
cant
imagine
what
i
would
do
with
a
six
pack
of
this
i
normally
like
wheat
beers
but
im
not
sure
about
this
wheat
normally
sweetens
a
beer
but
the
ginger
was
just
too
much
i
could
never
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
d
not
very
drinkable
this
ended
up
being
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
really
excited
me
all
that
much
its
probably
more
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
in
the
end
it
seemed
like
a
regular
wheat
beer
to
me
with
just
some
extra
spiciness
picked
up
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
at
state
line
poured
into
my
nonic
glass
appears
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
offwhite
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
grassy
grains
with
a
touch
of
real
ginger
root
there
is
certainly
ginger
in
this
brew
theres
a
slight
burn
on
the
tongue
like
a
spicy
ginger
beer
does
crisp
dry
finish
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
im
a
fan
of
ginger
beers
and
ginger
ales
and
thought
this
was
quite
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
revisiting
this
on
a
warm
day
the
aroma
has
fruit
wheat
malt
alcohol
spices
cooked
vegetables
and
some
hops
the
appearance
is
ambergold
with
a
small
head
there
are
lots
of
little
chunks
in
it
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
astringent
with
malt
and
very
little
ginger
the
palate
is
thin
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
interesting
even
if
its
not
really
that
good
notes
from
41205
yes
it
is
a
ginger
beer
yes
it
does
have
alcohol
as
it
should
out
of
the
bottle
the
brew
was
a
cloudy
honey
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
little
retention
however
and
the
lacing
left
something
to
be
desired
the
aroma
was
strongly
of
floral
hops
flowers
in
general
and
a
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
spiciness
the
flavors
were
at
first
semisweet
augmented
by
the
spicy
zip
of
ginger
and
a
good
balancing
pale
malt
herbal
hops
appeared
later
as
a
subtle
but
nice
addition
the
body
was
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
average
well
done
for
a
spiced
beer
and
quite
summery
this
beer
pours
a
murky
swamp
water
brown
color
the
head
is
nonexistent
the
aroma
is
of
ginger
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
of
ginger
too
but
it
is
a
lot
fainter
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
cloudy
dark
amber
color
nice
inchish
head
that
took
a
while
to
recede
the
pour
produced
some
carbonation
reminiscient
of
guinness
just
on
a
smaller
level
a
nice
white
ale
with
ginger
aroma
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
the
taste
is
very
similar
the
ginger
stays
with
you
from
the
first
taste
to
the
aftertaste
but
is
never
overpowering
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
spring
day
out
on
the
front
porch
a
hazy
golden
blonde
color
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
and
no
lacing
smells
slightly
sweet
some
wheat
malt
at
play
it
seems
and
a
very
subtle
ginger
note
taste
is
very
similar
sweet
up
front
taste
of
ginger
is
minimal
but
present
a
very
average
flavor
nothing
really
stands
out
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
very
nice
texture
moderate
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
take
away
from
the
creaminess
drinkable
as
hell
goes
down
very
easy
just
nothing
overlyspecial
or
to
seek
out
pours
a
rich
gold
color
with
little
head
that
soon
turns
into
no
head
mild
if
not
poor
carbonation
to
this
one
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
definitely
malty
the
first
couple
of
drinks
hinted
at
a
touch
of
ginger
but
as
this
beer
sat
a
while
and
warmed
up
a
bit
the
ginger
really
came
through
toward
the
end
not
a
single
bubble
of
carbonation
could
be
found
and
the
ginger
was
overpowering
i
think
this
would
still
be
a
weak
wheat
beer
even
if
the
ginger
was
removed
from
the
recipe
each
sip
reminded
me
more
and
more
of
asian
stir
fry
and
less
and
less
of
beer
this
is
a
tastey
brew
i
love
the
taste
of
fresh
ginger
but
it
can
be
overpowering
this
is
not
the
color
is
very
interesting
a
light
maple
appears
much
heavier
than
it
is
surprisingly
refreshing
as
well
pours
a
hazy
golden
copper
in
color
topped
with
an
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lacing
nose
is
muted
ginger
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweet
crystal
malt
seems
to
be
on
the
sourbitter
side
chunks
of
ginger
and
yeast
partially
suspended
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
less
visually
appealing
than
id
hoped
on
the
first
sip
this
one
is
fairly
crisp
and
spicy
but
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
rounder
smoother
malt
profile
thats
mildly
sweet
residual
ginger
character
lingers
and
provides
some
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
but
its
not
a
very
pronounced
contrast
tanginess
lingers
nicely
along
with
an
even
more
subtle
vegetal
quality
and
heat
from
the
ginger
and
this
is
more
rewarding
than
the
bite
of
the
ginger
on
the
first
sip
no
hops
here
that
i
can
detect
lighter
in
body
and
mouthfeel
this
one
is
also
fairly
low
in
alcohol
along
with
the
sour
aspect
i
detected
on
the
nose
theres
a
good
drinkability
to
this
one
neither
as
strong
nor
as
fullbodied
as
the
last
gingerale
ive
tried
the
real
ginger
from
kiuchi
this
one
is
a
welcome
addition
to
a
style
that
isnt
very
widely
available
in
the
u
s
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
drinkability
great
like
most
wheat
beers
this
is
a
definite
summer
quencher
would
pair
well
with
grilled
foods
or
sushi
d
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
nice
for
something
a
little
different
buy
yourself
a
thermos
or
something
to
keep
it
cold
and
pour
a
few
for
the
sand
and
shore
keep
them
bottles
of
the
beach
beyatch
it
pours
an
opaque
orangeamber
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhitehead
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
strong
undertone
of
orange
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
somewhat
citrus
fruity
with
just
a
whisper
of
hops
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
very
refreshing
and
delightful
this
beer
has
a
very
interesting
flavor
not
really
sure
if
i
really
dig
this
one
though
it
tastes
more
like
a
fruit
juice
than
a
beer
first
time
with
style
of
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
an
orange
hue
not
much
head
or
laceing
aroma
is
of
gingerwheatand
spices
body
is
mediumbut
over
carbonated
taste
is
tangyand
spiced
seems
like
they
threw
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
the
potand
got
it
to
work
d
very
flavorful
once
the
foaming
allows
the
tasting
to
begin
but
more
aroma
attention
was
given
this
is
one
of
the
better
spiced
american
wheats
i
have
taste
in
the
last
year
i
have
had
few
ales
w
ginger
to
compare
this
to
i
appreciated
the
mix
of
ginger
and
wheat
overall
atlantic
brewing
makes
a
nice
variety
of
ales
at
least
the
couple
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
is
probably
a
choice
best
suited
for
those
that
appreciate
fresh
ginger
but
i
think
it
would
go
well
w
a
variety
of
dishes
or
as
a
digestif
music
chris
liberator
live
rotation
in
iowa
city
dvery
unique
and
i
love
the
brewerys
attempt
at
using
ginger
in
a
session
beer
i
have
used
it
in
the
past
but
find
it
works
best
with
high
gravity
belgians
they
did
a
good
job
and
could
see
this
being
decent
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
in
the
marina
overall
just
an
average
spiced
beer
wish
the
ginger
would
be
a
little
more
overpowering
for
the
type
of
beer
its
supposed
to
be
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
no
ring
of
foam
nada
aroma
of
ginger
root
with
a
bit
of
lime
hiding
in
the
background
taste
is
spicy
ginger
root
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
all
quite
nicely
hops
are
way
in
the
background
but
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
attribute
probably
because
i
usually
drink
hoppy
beers
and
this
was
a
nice
change
goes
great
with
asian
food
but
its
enjoyable
by
itself
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
nicely
crafted
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
at
first
you
taste
a
delicate
ginger
blanket
of
flavor
followed
by
your
usual
malts
and
hops
and
in
this
case
some
additional
spices
little
to
no
aftertaste
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
a
spiced
beer
went
well
with
the
asian
takeout
ordered
not
sure
how
great
it
would
be
in
other
situations
though
this
was
a
very
interesting
drink
i
never
had
a
ginger
beer
before
and
this
one
did
a
good
job
to
perk
my
interest
but
it
didnt
give
me
that
unique
taste
i
was
hoping
for
either
d
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
atlantic
brewing
co
well
balanced
and
well
made
excellent
drinkability
particularly
for
an
herbedspiced
beer
nice
and
tasty
better
than
i
thought
and
certainly
much
more
balanced
i
just
cant
really
think
of
a
situation
where
a
ginger
ale
would
be
perfect
maybe
if
i
was
sick
drinkability
a
fine
beer
for
ginger
fans
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
in
succession
though
hazy
pale
amber
color
thin
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
and
some
spiciness
to
it
more
honey
then
ginger
lemony
and
spicy
flavorlike
the
aroma
i
detect
no
ginger
malty
enough
but
the
weird
spiciness
detracts
from
the
overall
flavor
ok
bodysomewhat
thin
and
dull
overall
its
rather
average
but
well
on
its
way
to
not
impressing
me
reminds
me
of
shandy
or
something
strangely
british
not
for
me
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
that
fizzles
to
nothing
smells
very
malty
worty
even
with
faint
ginger
taste
is
similar
but
rather
nutty
as
well
ginger
could
stand
out
more
for
my
tastes
and
would
help
to
make
this
more
refreshing
i
feel
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
yeasty
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
has
kind
of
weak
carbonation
decent
beer
all
around
drinkability
it
was
okay
it
is
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
friends
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
along
the
lines
of
a
refreshing
beer
for
summer
with
the
ginger
and
all
but
this
sort
of
threw
me
for
a
loop
it
wasnt
bad
but
reminded
me
more
of
a
fall
beer
with
the
taste
and
spicing
more
along
the
lines
of
a
pumpkin
flavored
beer
sans
the
pumpkin
of
course
it
just
had
a
real
earthiness
to
it
this
was
good
but
i
cant
see
consuming
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
flavor
isnt
quite
desirable
enough
for
a
session
beer
and
i
cant
think
of
a
situation
where
id
say
hmm
im
the
the
mood
for
a
ginger
beer
worth
trying
at
least
poured
a
very
pleasant
copperamber
color
light

with
a
fairly
shortlived
white

good
taste
with
the
spice
of
the
ginger
being
very
pronounced
but
not
overpowering
added
to
the
spice
of
the
ginger
was
a
noticable
fruitiness
overall
a
very
tasty
choice
and
good
example
of
a
summer
beer
poured
slowly
from
a
12oz
botter
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
this
unfiltered
beer
had
bits
of
ginger
visible

color
and

with

carbonation
definite
smell
of

dry
with

honey
tast
and
just
a
hint
of
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
end

was
medium
with
little
foam
or
acidity
very
drinkable

nothing
that
stands
out

invigorating
brew
finishes
a
little
dry
and
gingery
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
enjoyable
and
fun
worth
a
try
d
its
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
its
worth
a
try
if
its
something
that
you

wellbalanced
with
pleasantly
spicy
ginger
a
little
sweet
wheat
malt
and
a
very
clean
yeast
character
bitterness
is
low
but
the
ginger
takes
the
edge
of
the
sweetness
wellattenuated
crisp
and
dry
texture
drinkability
too
sweet
for
my
taste
not
even
comparable
to
left
hands
juju
ginger
overall
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
certain
if
i
would
buy
again
in
the
future
not
certain
if
ginger
mixed
with
beer
is
my
thing
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
great
in
the
sun
tastes
bready
slightly
sweeta
taste
of
ginger
a
medium
mouthfeelwith
a
slight
bitterness
and
sourness
at
the
finish
this
beer
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
was
a
little
on
the
bland
side
the
ginger
flavor
was
not
overpoweringbut
it
was
there
it
was
better
than
the
last
ginger
beer
i
tasted
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
d
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
not
a
session
beer
but
one
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
one
note
of
caution
however
while
the
ginger
flavor
isnt
overly
strong
the
taste
will
remain
on
the
palate
for
several
hours
even
after
consuming
another
stylebrand
of
beer
mount
desert
island
ginger
is
a
bit
of
a
niche
beer
im
not
sure
if
there
are
enough
ginger
lovers
out
there
for
it
to
sell
like
hotcakes
but
then
i
could
just
as
easily
not
know
what
the
hell
im
talking
about
it
seems
to
me
that
being
a
little
more
ginger
with
the
ginger
root
would
have
made
for
a
better
beer
this
beer
is
an
amberorange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
does
not
last
long
aroma
of
sweet
ginger
and
wheat
lightbodied
and
spicy
with
a
good
amount
of
ginger
flavor
some
malt
and
wheat
in
the
background
as
well
more
spiciness
in
the
finish
again
with
ginger
dominating
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
too
the
beer
seems
onedimensional
although
there
is
just
enough
going
on
behind
the
scenes
to
keep
it
from
being
below
average
atlantic
brewings
ginger
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
the
head
retention
however
is
limited
and
it
leaves
very
little
if
any
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
expresses
exactly
what
youll
find
in
the
flavor
wheat
malt
and
ginger
its
not
complex
but
enjoyable
and
its
nicely
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
beneath
the
zesty
ginger
its
medium
bodied
and
crisp
which
adds
to
its
refreshing
nature
nicely
done
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
full
of
ginger
so
much
ginger
that
i
dont
get
much
else
the
flavor
isnt
what
i
expected
there
is
plenty
of
ginger
in
there
and
not
many
other
spices
theres
also
not
much
residual
sweetness
the
dryness
takes
away
from
the
effect
that
the
ginger
could
bring
the
body
is
moderate
to
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again

12
oz
bottle
beer
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
into
a
tulip
glass
the
aroma
gives
you
some
ginger
hints
but
is
dominated
by
the
malt
tones
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
mainly
malt
tones
but
you
get
a
bit
more
ginger
on
the
tongue
overall
the
body
is
rather
light
and
the
taste
does
not
linger
for
very
long
the
ginger
spice
in
the
beer
seemed
bland
and
washedout
lacking
the
spicy
bite
of
fresh
ginger
root
or
the
aromatic
note
of
candied
ginger
moderate
malt
with
some
caramel
influence
which
tended
to
overshadow
the
vague
ginger
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
did
not
call
for
another
i
must
admit
i
did
take
some
and
mix
with
goslings
rum
and
had
myself
a
very
nice
dark
stormy
i
am
all
for
enjoying
this
beer
on
its
own
but
man
did
it
make
for
a
hell
of
a
ds
its
a
terrific
experiment
wheat
and
ginger
they
combine
for
great
sensations
in
the
flavor
and
feel
initial
sip
takes
on
lemony
a
light
belgian
tartness
and
a
whollop
of
ginger
flavor
the
ginger
plays
hot
on
in
the
mouth
combined
with
the
modest
alcohol
it
becomes
very
spicy
and
dry
the
wheat
takes
on
citrus
and
bready
aromas
that
translate
well
to
flavor
the
wheat
base
also
becomes
very
american
which
thins
the
body
and
weakens
the
flavor
if
a
german
wheat
base
were
used
allowing
the
creaminess
of
offset
the
spiciness
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer

patchy
and
thin
head
over

bubbles
boil
up
making
swirls
apprear
atop

im
amazed
that
the
head
cant
find
a
way
to
form
even
with
the
solid
carbonation
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
gingery
i
get
notes
of
apircot
and
banana
with
a
very
nice
gingery
zing
lots
of
sweetness
i
like
it
flavor
is
a
little
less
bold
than
the
aroma
the
ginger
is
there
on
the
start
it
tastes
like
there
is
a
bit
of
wheat
in
the
base
beer
as
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
flavor
that
i
associate
with
wheat
if
i
would
take
the
time
to
read
the
beer
label
before
i
start
my
review
i
would
see
that
this
one
is
called
a
wheat
ale
brewed
with
fresh
ginger
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
of
very
fine
bubbles
i
think
this
beer
really
hits
a
homerun
with
what
it
sets
out
to
be
it
is
every
bit
a
wheat
beer
brewed
with
ginger
the
ginger
is
very
fresh
and
spicey
but
not
over
the
top
and
offensive
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
and
some
nice
carbonation
it
had
a
sweet
spicy
aroma
it
tasted
malty
with
some
spiciness
ginger
which
was
nicely
warming
fairly
assertive
a
fun
beer
to
drink
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
brew
is
a
light
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
moderately
dense
white
head
bottle
conditioned
the
aroma
is
fixed
with
a
spicy
ginger
character
and
a
bit
of
malt
and
faint
hops
theres
a
little
maltiness
underneath
and
the
ginger
isnt
overdone
its
floral
herbal
and
just
a
little
yeasty
the
beer
is
fairly
light
and
well
carbonated
its
just
slightly
sweet
in
the
foretaste
with
ginger
coming
out
in
the
midtaste
the
herbal
and
spiciness
of
the
ginger
linger
through
the
finish
its
sort
of
refreshing
and
i
kept
thinking
that
it
would
go
well
with
sushi
its
not
a
satisfying
outstanding
beer
in
its
own
right
but
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
use
of
ginger
the
spice
doesnt
overwhelm
the
beer
and
its
something
different
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
great
a
different
beer
that
would
probably
go
good
with
some
chinese
stir
fry
interesting
d
one
and
done
for
me
my
friends
i
recommend
trying
it
but
after
that
its
on
your
shoulders
drinkability
and
overall
wow
what
a
huge
difference
between
the
taste
and
the
smell
one
of
the
best
smelling
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
but
one
of
the
worst
tasting
how
crazy
is
that
oh
well
i
gotta
give
atlantic
props
because
this
is
definitly
a
good
idea
although
not
executed
as
well
as
it
could
have
been
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
the
kid
in
me
wanted
an
overpowering
ginger
sensation
which
this
does
not
deliver
also
i
thought
the
coupling
of
ginger
with
a
wheat
ale
rather
odd
it
seems
like
it
might
be
more
at
home
brewed
in
a
lager
m
d
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
the
taste
of
ginger
is
very
refreshing
kinda
carbonated
but
not
too
overwhelming
drinkability
is
pretty
high
on
this
offering
from
atlantic
brewing
company
depending
on
if
you
like
ginger
or
not
will
determine
how
you
like
this
one
would
be
good
with
sushi
emma
gives
it
two
thumbs
up
as
this
is
mostly
her
rating
im
surprised
to
say
that
an
herbed
beer
is
a
real
smooth
drinking
summer
style
beer
but
this
definitely
is
i
liked
it
taste
is
also
that
grassy
malt
backed
with
a
solid
ginger
bite
i
feared
the
ginger
may
overwheln
the
beer
and
the
palate
but
happily
that
is
not
the
case
quite
well
balanced
with
the
spice
assisting
not
dominating
the
overall
flavor
crisp
and
light
to
medium
bodies
an
easy
drinker
as
well
a
pleasant
surprise
would
be
nice
on
a
cool
spring
evening
drinkability
this
beer
is
great
regardless
of
how
cold
it
is

yes
and
probably
much
better
suited
for
a
summer
day
than
a
cold
night
in

nonetheless
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
gingerspiced
beers
in
general
i
enjoyed
the
beer
very
much
but
maybe
its
a
bit
of
a
onehit
wonder
more
than
two
for
sure
would
be
overdoing
it
time
to
branch
out
and
try
something
else
different
it
poured
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
but
it
rapidly
dissipated
and
then
disappeared
almost
entirely
the
color
was
a
cloudy
medium
to
deep
amber
but
the
color
was
secondary
to
the
smell
man
was
it
ever
rich
with
ginger
i
caught
it
on
the
nose
then
again
on
the
palate
and
one
last
time
on
the
finish
the
bottles
label
identifies
the
beer
as
wheat
ale
brewed
with
fresh
ginger
and
malt
notes
underneath
froths
up
nicely

looking
at
the
bottle
i
can
see
flecks
of
spice
gathered
in
the
bottom
i
poured
this
into
a
standard
pint
glass
which
revealed
a
pale
amber
body
and
a
thin
cap
of
foam
that
recedes
to
a
paper
thin
layer
of
foam
on

i
decided
to
go
all
out
and
just
dump
all
the
stuff
from
the
bottom
straight
in
the
aroma

basically
dominated

only
part
of
this
beer
i
liked
was
the
aroma
since
i
am
not
much
of
a
fruitbeer
drinker
but
no
real
ginger
flavor
except
for
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
flavors
lingered
a
bit
as
an
aftertaste
this
was
an
ok
beer
smells
quite
gingery
because
it
is
fantastic
by
the
way
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
with
about
a
fingers
width
of
offwhite
foam
color
is
difficult
to
determine
because
of
how
murky
it
is
looks
like
a
reddish
brown
color
there
is
an
overwhelming
amount
of
particles
floating
throughout
the
brew
has
a
strong
fig
and
spice
aroma
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
initial
taste
is
of
fig
and
spices
followed
by
slight
orange
peel
flavor
malts
and
hops
enter
the
taste
palate
as
the
fig
flavors
disappear
but
the
orange
peel
and
spices
remain
overall
taste
is
very
unique
but
nothing
impressive
an
above
average
beer
definitely
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
definitely
my
favorite
xmas
brew
here
in
ny
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
great
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
spices
the
only
negative
aspect
of
the
beer
is
that
the
flavor
of
the
beer
doesnt
really
match
the
aroma
meaning
there
is
less
gingerbread
in
the
flavor
than
is
promised
in
the
aroma
that
being
said
its
an
extremely
tasty
beer
and
one
that
i
will
certainly
get
again
next
winter
oyou
want
a
spiced
christmas
ale
well
hear
you
go
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
be
but
lets
just
say
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
single
and
not
a
sixer
too
overloaded
to
drink
more
than
one
still
rating
is
for
style
and
what
is
supposed
to
be
overall
drinkability
definitely
right
that
this
beer
was
labeled
as
an
herbedspiced
beer
rather
than
as
a
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
very
intense
in
the
spices
and
while
ive
not
had
a
swedish
glogg
it
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
highly
spiced
teawinter
drink
if
there
are
hops
in
this
i
cannot
detect
them
over
all
the
spices
overall
a
glass
of
christmas
spice
smell
in
a
glass
drinkability
this
one
was
hard
to
finish
and
while
it
was
good
to
try
for
the
concept
i
could
easily
see
one
either
loving
or
hating
this
beer
i
found
it
interesting
but
i
think
i
would
be
forcing
myself
to
finish
off
a
whole
bottle
so
im
glad
i
shared
it
with
others
so
not
high
drinkability
but
ill
give
it
good
marks
for
depth
and
intensity
of
flavor
smells
and
tastes
like
christmas
thank
you
southern
tier
brewing
company
i
had
never
tried
this
type
of
beer
before
and
when
i
popped
the
top
i
was
kind
of
offput
by
the
smell
very
pot
pouri
smelling
i
didnt
like
the
taste
of
it
at
all
but
i
cant
say
whether
it
was
brewed
badly
or
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
perfectly
balanced
and
not
too
heavy
so
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
you
must
try
this
beer
overall
this
a
great
example
of
a
spiced
beer
especially
one
that
is
brewed
for
the
holidays
o
enjoyable
this
beer
looks
and
smells
great
the
flavor
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
as
its
a
little
bitter
and
almost
too
spicy
but
its
a
good
rich
beer
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
christmas
beer
heavily
spiced
with
nutmeg
clove
and
ginger
overally
hopped
with
little
malt
balance
overall
not
a
style
im
fond
of
but
a
lighter
touch
on
the
spices
would
make
this
more
palatable
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
reflect
a
heavy
use
of
nutmeg
there
are
some
other
spices
in
here
too
but
the
overall
spicing
level
is
just
too
high
largely
masking
the
malts
i
poured
this
one
out
for
my
homies
was
unable
to
do
more
than
2
sips
of
this
this
tasted
like
potpourri
to
me
much
the
same
way
potpourri
stings
my
eyes
this
really
disagreed
with
my
palate
dark
amber
color
with
great
head
and
mild
carbonation
you
can
smell
this
beer
from
across
the
room
lots
of
spice
fruit
like
fig
sweetness
for
aroma
very
strong
flavors
of
black
pepper
spice
fruit
overly
spiced
which
ruins
it
not
good
this
year
someone
had
a
heavy
hand
with
those
spices
heavily
spiced
and
a
little
to
thin
to
support
it
all
causing
the
unbalancing
act
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
swas
amazing
all
the
holiday
spices
you
would
expect
from
a
holiday
beer
it
smelled
like
mulling
spices
twas
good
with
light
spices
following
the
nose
the
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
smell
i
was
expecting
more
ogood
sipping
beer
but
got
kind
of
boring
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
glass
i
would
bring
this
out
for
a
party
as
an
easy
beer
for
the
non
beer
drinkers
that
would
come
over
good
head
a
bit
sugary
malty
thick
feel
which
wanst
too
pleasant
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
good
hints
of
spice
had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
really
nice
deep
brown
almost
a
maple
syrup
sweet
flavor
spices
some
citrus
on
the
tail
end
particularly
orange
reasonable
carbonation
i
actually
think
its
a
bit
underrated
good
stuff
does
not
taste
as
good
as
it
looks
or
smells
slightly
hazy
copperamber
pour
with
an
offwhite
one
finger
head
with
minimal
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
incredible
huge
spice
notes
with
hints
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
ginger
and
orange
peel
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
spices
dominating
huge
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
and
clove
along
with
hints
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
tangy
spicy
finish
overall
maybe
im
just
in
the
christmas
spirit
but
this
is
an
amazing
interpretation
of
the
style
the
spices
are
bold
but
not
overpowering
and
its
hugely
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
beers
yet
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
evaporates
quickly
smells
of
cinnamon
oranges
caramom
ginger
lemon
zest
flavor
is
interesting
quite
intense
it
is
sweet
and
rich
but
it
has
strong
aftertaste
of
hops
and
all
the
other
spices
that
are
present
a
bit
off
putting
it
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
strong
after
taste
overall
this
was
alright
it
wasnt
horrible
but
i
do
need
to
wash
out
this
weird
aftertaste
too
much
bull
going
on
in
this
beer
smelling
christmas
and
tasting
christmas
are
two
different
things
entirely
after
forcing
down
another
half
a
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
i
have
to
say
that
this
jagermeister
diarrhea
with
cloves
absolutely
terrible
overall
very
very
good
beer
its
not
mind
blowing
but
its
very
good
definitely
will
put
you
in
mind
of
christmas
with
the
aromas
and
flavors
blech
way
too
heavy
on
the
ginger
taste
similar
to
a
very
bitter
shaving
cream
not
for
me
way
too
much
spice
i
havent
dumped
a
beer
down
the
drain
since
summer
but
this
was
just
not
enjoyable
for
me
my
ratings
were
generous
overall
easy
drinking
flavorful
complex
a
real
winner
o
this
one
is
tough
i
want
so
much
to
like
this
but
not
sure
i
do
i
do
like
medicine
flavors
that
are
less
sugary
and
normally
along
side
good
bitter
hops
but
this
medicine
flavor
is
just
too
sweet
and
licorice
in
terms
of
nailing
the
christmas
flavor
it
lives
up
to
its
name
and
id
give
it
a
5
0
but
as
a
beer
that
id
like
to
drink
again
i
cant
rate
it
so
high
this
beer
has
a
deep
dark
aged
copper
body
with
a
thick
beige
head
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
dry
ginger
with
some
other
dry
herbal
spices
cloves
notes
in
the
finish
the
taste
has
bolder
powdered
ginger
spice
that
leads
to
more
herbal
dry
spice
flavor
with
some
allspice
hints
and
coriander
dryness
in
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
no
alcohol
heat
the
spice
flavor
really
dominates
and
covers
up
any
malt
character
it
was
ok
to
have
one
but
the
spice
is
just
to
much
to
make
a
second
one
enjoyable
very
spicy
love
it
for
the
season
the
beer
is
very
good
it
pours
very
dark
and
reddish
the
aroma
is
all
about
the
spices
i
get
a
lot
of
ginger
orange
peel
and
maybe
nutmeg
or
allspice
the
taste
is
bold
hoppy
and
sweet
i
can
taste
honey
very
good
mixture
of
everything
you
would
expect
from
a
christmas
beer
or
winter
warmer
i
recommend
it
ginger
and
medicinal
not
what
i
was
looking
for
not
big
on
beers
overly
spiced
with
holiday
flavors
good
but
i
would
not
revisit
more
due
to
the
flavor
profile
than
anything
else
spice
monster
i
actually
enjoy
a
lot
of
the
distinct
flavors
this
brings
to
the
table
with
cinnamon
followed
by
cardamom
and
orange
peels
leading
to
figs
but
it
all
clashes
the
cardamom
seems
to
grow
with
each
sip
and
throws
things
off
i
can
certainly
appreciate
spiced
beers
but
the
after
taste
of
this
beer
is
off
putting
at
times
pours
a
copper
reddish
with
a
very
small
slight
off
white
head
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
smell
is
cloves
and
banana
and
cinnamon
and
bubble
gum
my
god
it
smells
like
christmas
medium
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
interesting
it
was
a
good
bit
pineyer
than
i
expected
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
honestly
theres
a
little
too
much
going
on
tastewise
all
the
smells
are
represented
in
the
flavor
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
not
really
sure
if
i
like
the
taste
but
i
know
i
like
the
smell
a
whole
lot
more
wow
that
is
unlike
an
any
beer
ive
ever
had
i
appreciate
it
but
not
my
favorite
at
all
the
smell
was
pure
pickled
ginger
like
the
one
you
get
when
you
get
sushi
the
overall
taste
was
like
a
cleaning
agent
with
lemon
and
ginger
i
know
that
sounds
weird
but
thats
this
beer
in
a
nutshell
i
usually
love
st
but
this
was
not
for
me
first
ever
drain
pour
almost
a
slight
barrelaged
tinge
to
it
different
and
fun
o
a
good
seasonal
christmas
ale
im
glad
the
spice
profile
in
the
taste
is
toned
down
compared
to
the
nose
this
is
a
good
beer
to
get
a
person
in
the
christmas
spirit
overall
a
fine
xmas
ale
just
enough
spice
to
make
if
different
a
solid
offering
from
st
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
winter
spiced
brew
the
spices
mix
well
with
the
malt
and
subtle
fruit
notes
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
fantastic
seasonal
does
wonders
with
a
year
under
its
belt
i
thought
this
tasted
a
lot
like
pumking
without
the
pumpkin
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
completely
come
together
for
me
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
a
thin
creamwhite
head
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
the
aroma
is
great
with
unique
spice
tones
once
you
know
whats
in
it
you
can
recognize
the
cardamom
and
ginger
amongst
the
others
the
taste
builds
on
the
aromas
and
the
fruit
additions
play
quite
well
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
and
a
little
spicy
tingle
from
the
ginger
on
the
finish
pairs
perfectly
with
thanksgiving
dinner
overall
their
are
much
better
choices
for
this
style
cheers
very
spice
forward
with
an
aggressive
almost
astringent
cinnamon
clove
and
allspice
profile
especially
cloves
huge
cloves
and
cinnamon
theres
allspice
there
too
not
liking
this
not
getting
much
else
beyond
the
medicinal
spices
ugh
im
not
sure
i
can
finish
this
not
recomendied
excellent
xmasxmas
if
you
love
spices
especially
cloves
youre
in
for
a
treat
unfortunately
i
despise
cloves
sadly
its
the
1st
beer
ive
ever
poured
down
the
drain
after
having
2
sips
wish
i
checked
my
ba
app
before
buying
the
6
pack
my
fault
lots
of
spices
perhaps
too
much
i
like
it
better
than
their
pumpkin
beer
tho
overly
spiced
to
the
point
that
its
not
enjoyable
o
a
pretty
interesting
spiced
christmas
ale
the
aroma
was
much
more
spiceforward
than
the
flavor
the
flavor
profile
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
too
cloying
i
wouldnt
really
want
more
than
one
in
a
night
as
it
was
a
little
boozy
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
season
o
this
is
definitely
a
christmas
beer
lots
of
spicinessnutmeg
cinnamon
orange
fig
think
the
way
the
yankee
candle
store
smells
at
christmas
time
then
to
top
it
off
there
is
a
big
alcohol
warmth
the
perfect
beer
for
an
ugly
christmas
sweater
party
its
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
little
over
the
top
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
with
some
age
on
it
ill
have
to
pick
a
pack
up
this
holiday
season
to
see
what
it
is
like
fresh
overall
this
is
a
big
spicy
ale
that
drinks
like
a
smaller
spiced
ale
pretty
good
brew
once
you
get
used
to
it
sampling
this
one
does
not
do
it
justice
2xmas
needs
time
to
build
after
that
its
kinda
nice
taste
is
more
gingerforward
which
isnt
so
bad
but
this
seems
it
would
drink
better
if
it
were
counterbalanced
with
sweet
vanilla
or
creamier
bread
notes
this
ginger
flavor
is
more
in
line
with
the
root
than
with
the
holiday
cookie
clove
in
here
as
well
ends
somewhat
dry
and
peppery
too
the
biggest
disappointment
for
me
was
the
role
the
orange
plays
the
orange
must
contribute
to
the
spicing
because
it
certainly
doesnt
lend
any
actual
orange
flavor
or
citrus
refreshment
for
that
matter
other
than
that
this
beer
seems
to
live
up
to
resembling
the
spicier
mulled
wine
flavors
of
the
norwegian
glogg
for
which
its
named
not
my
favorite
style
but
pleasant
and
one
and
done
c
a
totally
different
holiday
brew
experience
im
glad
i
held
off
reviewing
this
because
the
first
i
drank
last
november
ended
up
feeding
my
drain
this
was
at
least
palatable
but
still
far
from
my
flavor
profile
preference
i
cant
take
off
too
much
just
because
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
because
i
think
they
did
what
they
did
well
but
ill
never
buy
more
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
good
holidaywinter
warmer
type
beer
pours
medium
to
dark
amber
touch
of
foam
on
top
light
sweet
nose
jammy
and
figs
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
orange
fig
flavors
sweet
malt
spiced
finish
a
touch
sweet
but
has
a
little
bitter
balance
works
for
the
season
nice
festive
beer
southern
tier
is
usually
pretty
solid
in
my
book
but
not
this
one
here
what
i
detect
to
be
nutmeg
ginger
cinnamon
cloves
and
conifer
doesnt
work
well
together
well
at
least
not
for
my
palate
overall
im
very
surprised
this
is
so
good
of
all
the
holiday
offerings
this
is
one
of
the
first
im
going
to
try
and
find
an
entire
6pack
of
my
last
2014
christmas
beer
unless
i
pick
up
one
more
krampus
i
saw
my
local
still
has
clear
thin
amber
color
with
light
colored
head
smells
is
strong
nutmeg
and
spice
i
pick
up
some
cinnamon
as
well
taste
kind
of
well
actually
just
like
potpourii
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
and
just
slightly
bitter
but
definitely
not
really
sweet
overall
its
ok
i
think
i
would
have
rated
this
a
bit
higher
before
christmas
but
now
after
the
holidays
somethings
wore
off
with
that
said
i
will
look
forward
to
another
six
pack
next
christmas
but
i
will
drink
all
of
it
before
the
holiday
is
over
guess
some
things
arent
better
if
you
wait
2xmas
packed
to
the
brim
with
spice
like
santas
gift
bag
on
christmas
eve
smells
and
tastes
like
christmas
not
wanting
to
bah
humbug
this
beer
the
sweet
and
decadent
malt
could
be
more
forward
for
an
even
more
delectable
holiday
drinking
experience
great
job
southern
tier
not
my
fave
christmas
beer
but
its
okay
i
really
like
this
seasonal
ale
brewed
with
figs
orange
peels
and
spices
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
on
the
palate
not
a
all
hoppy
and
the
8
percent
alcohol
completely
missed
me
until
i
read
the
label
its
a
very
nice
ale
flavor
not
a
strong
anything
in
the
mouth
except
for
good
flavor
and
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
day
or
night
not
my
first
tasting
to
mention
this
is
my
third
or
fourth
over
the
past
month
and
its
still
a
whole
lot
of
winter
fun
and
flavorful
ale
o
like
black
pepper
on
your
fruitcake
i
didnt
think
so
either
but
this
ended
up
being
a
tasty
beer
i
usually
prefer
holiday
ales
balanced
more
toward
toasted
malt
this
though
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
i
always
feel
like
winter
seasonals
are
a
dime
a
dozen
however
this
one
is
a
bit
more
on
the
sweeter
side
yet
the
spices
complement
do
not
overpower
the
base
one
of
the
better
ones
this
year
two
fingers
of
dark
yet
oddly
glowing
tan
foam
looks
backlit
or
something
full
mix
of
bubble
sizes
and
pretty
good
retention
for
the
category
same
could
be
said
for
the
lacing
sticks
well
crystal
clear
liquid
deep
coppery
brown
inclines
more
towards
red
than
orange
not
that
many
bubbles
but
they
rise
with
swift
insistence
pretty
enough
overall
the
nose
is
all
cardamom
anise
pine
sap
clove
and
cinnamon
huge
cleansing
lift
in
the
nostrils
milk
chocolate
and
orange
peels
not
getting
the
figs
nor
other
fruit
here
basically
smells
like
the
bowls
of
seeds
and
stuff
at
the
entrance
to
an
indian
restaurant

again
has
a
sort
of
mentholated
cleansing
feel
fresh
and
tingly
still
not
getting
much
fig
or
other
dried
fruits
some
light
apple
or
peach
maybe
soft
undercurrent
of
blanched
nuts
easy
to
see
how
the
intensity
of
the
spices
could
polarize
love
it
or
hate
it
finding
it
food
friendly
and
lack
of
sweetness
adds
to
versatility
could
not
do
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
but
they
would
be
enjoyable
start
to

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
madden
beverage
saco
me
possibly
the
best
winter
holiday
beer
this
year
notes
too
sweet
for
me
i
think
i
am
done
with
christmas
flavored
beers
a
nice
winter
warmer
multiple
bottles
would
warm
you
up
nicely
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
spiced
beers
a
handful
of
these
would
make
for
a
happy
evening
easy
to
drink
as
the
spices
approach
the
line
but
never
cross
it
a
good
choice
for
a
seasonal
because
it
would
eventually
wear
on
you
overall
pretty
good
spiced
winter
warmer
ill
grab
another
overall
a
decent
beer
as
noted
the
spices
were
a
bit
overbearing
personally
but
then
again
the
style
is
an
herbedspiced
beer
so
cant
detract
from
that
based
on
what
it
is
still
smooth
however
and
does
have
ample
complexity
claims
it
is
brewed
with
figs
spices
4
malts
and
2
hops
which
accurate
to
the
taste
with
an
xmas
themed
bottle
and
cool
name
why
not
give
it
a
try
tis
the
season
o
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
winter
warmer
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
style
until
i
tried
this
one
will
drink
again
next
christmas
o
definitely
what
i
want
to
be
drinking
in
front
of
the
fire
on
a
cold
day
tasty
brew
the
taste
is
good
with
lots
of
spice
and
and
an
orange
zest
and
slight
toasted
malt
with
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
very
low
alcohol
in
the
taste
with
nice
woodiness
and
a
slight
hint
of
cinnamon
bark
the
taste
has
a
nice
amount
of
dried
fruit
and
hops
bittering
but
not
too
bitter
with
a
slight
dry
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
celebrating
it
is
strong
but
you
dont
really
taste
any
alcohol
since
the
spice
covers
it
pretty
well
talk
about
a
full
bodied
beer
had
this
ale
back
to
back
against
another
christmas
one
and
this
wins
in
the
taste
category

at
the
top
quickly
dissipates
though
nutmeg
and
other
christmas
spices
emanate
from
the
glass
get
a
hint
of
orange
peel
in
the
taste
along
with
a
carmel
toffee
taste
bottle
says
that
it
includes
figs
which
definitely
comes
out
on
the
palate
mentions
that
uses
two
hop
varietals
and
4
malts
not
sure
what
tradition
of
swedish
glogg
brewing
is
but
apparently
thats
the
metho
of
brewing
an
excellent
christmas
ale
while
i
did
not
pick
up
any
booze
in
the
aroma
i
tend
to
pick
it
up
a
b
it
more
in
the
taste
that
could
be
the
ginger
but
it
tastes
more
like
booze
to
me
lingering
finish
still
a
nice
beer
o
as
a
christmas
brew
this
did
the
job
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
grab
one
of
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
sure
you
can
have
too
many
without
tiring
of
it
o
it
left
me
craving
for
a
hoppy
beer
rjt
o
i
enjoyed
the
beer
it
is
just
not
high
on
my
list
of
beers
to
have
if
i
have
the
choice
i
was
glad
to
try
it
and
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
because
with
the
sweetness
more
than
12oz
would
have
been
too
much
for
me
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
so
to
sum
up
its
quite
an
interesting
beer
its
got
some
complexity
to
it
if
you
like
spiced
beers
youll
love
it
i
really
enjoy
them
at
thanksgiving
and
xmas
get
togethers
and
i
always
bring
a
few
with
me
to
pass
around
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
uncle
joe
is
not
going
to
like
this
one
thats
ok
he
likes
old
fezziwig
ill
have
another
one
of
these
overall
its
a
good
beer
for
the
holidays
it
may
not
be
that
i
want
to
follow
this
one
with
another
but
it
is
one
that
would
quickly
come
back
in
the
rotation
say
maybe
not
the
next
but
the
next
one
after
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
complex
and
nicely
spiced
sweet
bitter
and
spice
all
playing
nice
for
the
holidays
overall
not
a
bad
christmas
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cardamom
but
like
southern
tier
using
a
spice
you
or
i
rarely
see
in
other
christmas
brews
they
do
a
great
job
pairing
the
other
flavors
well
with
it
an
enjoyable
offering
that
i
would
order
with
a
seasonal
dessert
or
on
a
cold
night
around
a
fire
pours
a
dark
amber
with
dark
ruby
hue
good
head
with
nice
lacing
that
dissipates
the
nose
is
a
wow
of
spice
ginger
cinnamon
clove
and
either
cardamom
or
allspice
against
a
slight
dark
malt
sweetness
medium
body
and
carbonation
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
an
exceptional
blend
of
spice
against
a
slight
malt
sweetness
well
balanced
with
a
focus
on
christmas
spices
that
is
expertly
taken
to
the
limit
of
flavor
clean
finish
with
a
burst
of
spice
flavor
and
a
nice
warm
burn
if
you
like
spice
this
beer
is
for
you
a
very
tasted
spiced
christmas
ale
good
flavor
and
feel
and
another
winner
in
the
2x
series
from
southern
tier
i
like
this
christmas
ale
but
i
dont
think
its
southern
tiers
greatest
accomplishment
i
do
think
its
good
and
worth
drinking
again
tasted
like
someone
dumped
the
whole
spice
cabinet
into
this
mix
overall
ok
at
first
its
not
too
bad
with
the
syrupy
flavors
and
fruit
spices
are
nice
at
first
too
but
all
that
quickly
wears
out
its
welcome
and
turns
into
a
not
so
pleasant
beer
everything
becomes
too
much
too
syrupy
too
much
bitter
spices
bad
bitter
aftertaste
too
much
fusel
alc
etc
okay
words
cannot
describe
how
bad
this
beer
is
it
has
a
beautiful
color
just
like
the
2x
ipa
but
it
smells
like
a
bad
candle
and
the
taste
what
on
earth
were
they
thinking
first
off
to
take
a
beer
as
hoppy
and
citrisy
as
their
2x
ipa
and
mix
it
with
cinnamon
seems
bad
enough
but
its
like
they
put
half
a
container
of
it
in
every
beer
it
has
a
painful
taste
like
chugging
a
bottle
of
cinnamon
i
truly
have
no
idea
how
anyone
enjoys
this
beer
and
at
the
craft
beer
store
i
work
at
it
is
easily
the
most
hated
beer
among
the
staff
not
just
of
the
seasonals
but
of
any
beers
never
would
expect
this
from
southern
tier
overall
tastes
like
christmas
no
idea
it
was
8
abv
until
i
went
to
write
the
review
it
hides
it
very
well
this
is
a
worthwhile
seasonal
i
picked
up
a
couple
unusual
characteristics
that
were
pretty
neat
the
first
thing
i
smelled
was
freshly
baked
sugar
cookies
im
not
really
sure
how
or
why
but
there
you
have
it
secondly
the
taste
and
maybe
even
mouthfeel
had
the
sense
of
eggnog
who
knows
ill
update
if
for
some
reason
my
sniffer
and
tongue
were
nutty
tonight
overall
this
was
delightful
i
would
probably
get
this
again
low
carbonation
dark
complexion
figs
apparent
in
the
smell
as
well
as
the
spices
faint
touches
of
eggnog
probably
the
spices
nice
medium
mouthfeel
spicy
flavoring
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
solid
spiced
winter
seasonal
o
reminds
me
of
fruitcake
and
gingerbread
though
the
spicing
is
a
little
aggressive
for
my
palate
it
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
christmas
or
winter
warmer
style
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
draft
version
had
less
hot
notes
and
more
sweetness
got
a
growler
of
this
to
share
with
my
music
listening
buds
as
expected
one
of
my
buds
brought
a
growler
of
great
lakes
christmas
ale
which
this
compared
very
favorably
against
it
wasnt
a
competition
rather
just
a
means
of
expanding
horizons
the
spices
of
this
work
very
well
as
do
the
malts
which
underlie
this
o
a
good
take
on
a
christmas
beer
spice
may
be
a
bit
sharp
for
some
but
if
spices
are
your
thing
like
they
are
mine
then
grab
this
offering
its
a
well
crafted
style
and
a
bit
odd
but
tasty
nonetheless
o
love
it
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
leaves
behind
scattered
lace
smell
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
clover
ginger
and
vanilla
taste
all
of
that
a
winter
warmer
that
has
loads
of
spices
body
is
medium
nice
amount
of
life
not
dry
and
goes
down
easy
for
its
8
this
is
solid
a
little
more
spicy
than
i
prefer
but
it
is
a
nice
change
pumpkin
beer
fans
should
like
a
good
beer
that
oozes
christmas
spirit
o
as
i
guy
who
typically
doesnt
like
heavily
spiced
beers
i
can
still
respect
this
especially
since
it
is
taking
its
inspiration
from
glogg
a
drink
that
is
quintessentially
spicy
and
fruity
the
malty
richness
provides
a
strong
enough
base
to
ground
the
spices
even
if
they
do
come
on
very
strong
any
fan
of
spiced
winter
beers
will
enjoy
this
appearance
is
a
deep
clear
red
with
tan
head
nice
retention
and
lace
the
nose
is
all
christmas
tons
of
spices
with
cinnamon
ginger
and
spruce
being
the
most
prevalent
notes
some
fruity
notes
are
present
most
significant
is
orange
taste
is
much
like
nose
plus
some
nice
malty
graham
cracker
notes
moderate
sweetness
here
with
the
spices
hitting
hard
at
the
finish
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
lingering
notes
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
well
carbonated
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
worth
a
try
if
you
like
your
beer
spiced
overy
bold
attempt
by
southern
tier
the
flavors
are
very
in
your
face
but
they
work
well
named
perfectly
since
this
does
taste
like
a
christmas
tree
bit
of
a
spice
bomb
which
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
but
i
could
drink
this
again
if
the
mood
hits
comparable
to
great
lakes
christmas
ale
minus
the
hunt
very
malty
on
top
of
all
the
spices
this
is
an
excellent
excellent
christmas
beer
im
very
impressed
with
everything
they
listed
on
the
label
is
actually
is
in
the
taste
as
well
this
at
the
christmas
dinner
table
would
be
a
great
addition
good
job
southern

ruby
colored

a
billowing
head
khaki

leaves
fine

is
full
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
clover
and
other
christmas
ales
meant
to
attract
some
of
the
great
lakes
christmas
ale
following
but
in
a
higher
alcohol
format
an
ale
brewed
with
figs
orange
peels
and
spices
look
im
getting
super
malts
and
spice
additions
overall
a
super
sweet
cloying
mess
that
should
be
drank
in
moderation
im
willing
to
vogue
for
this
spiced
beer
but
at
the
alcohol
level
and
spice
discomforts
i
would
wait
until
this
is
your
last
option
to
drink
an
xmas
ale
overall
look
forward
to
other
highly
spice
and
highly
drinkable
offerings

with

bit
of
an
bitter
orange

flavor
on
the
end
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
an
interesting
yet
drinkable
take
on
a
holiday
brew
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
coppery
color
with
a
half
finger
slightly
off

which
leaves
a

the

is
christmas
there
is
dark

cinnomon
nutmeg
fruit
cake
and
holiday
spices
with
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
follows
suit
but
not
as
powerful
there
is
a
sweet
dark
fruit
molasses
flavor
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
spices
a
good
flavor
just
not
as
there
as
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
a
little
slick
and
smooth
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
addition
overall
not
the
best
christmas
beer
ive
ever
had
that
goes
to
la
grivoise
de
noel
but
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
doesnt
go
overboard
its
also
fairly
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
if
southern
tier
distributes
in
your
area
and
reasonably
priced
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
nice
winter
spice
beer
easily
drinkable
and
tasty
but
not
really
complex
or
special
here
just
a
good
winter
spice
ale

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
spiced
christmas
ale
great
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
fruit
and
spice
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
extremely
good
session
seasonal
i
only
got
a
few
loose
bottles
this
year
this
ones
on
the
short
list
for
a
few
sixers
next
time
around
not
a
bad
christmas
seasonal
but
needs
a
little
bit
of
cleaning
up
d
this
was
a
nice
holiday
ale
with
lots
of
spice
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
good
with
a
smooth
finish
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
mmm
o
a
very
unique
and
good
spiced
winter
ale
enjoyed
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
it
o
dig
this
beer
for
what
it
is
its
a
very
nice
christmas
drink
or
for
that
matter
winter
brew
i
love
the
spices
in
it
i
could
not
drink
more
then
a
couple
as
it
can
be
a
bit
sweet
at
the
end
but
overall
very
nice
the
feel
is
nicely
thick
with
a
bit
of
heft
in
its
sturdy
body
its
smooth
and
doesnt
offer
so
much
a
crispness
as
a
bite
even
as
it
hits
the
lips
it
does
nip
a
little
hard
initially
but
the
smoothness
wins
out
and
tones
it
down
this
is
fine
enough
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
a
problem
or
a
disaster
either
it
became
a
little
more
annoying
in
time
mdo
a
wonderful
christmas
beer
spices
are
friendly
and
inviting
and
rich
without
being
overdone
too
much
the
fig
complements
the
malt
base
fantastically
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
i
have
had
well
done
st
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
holidaychristmas
style
beer
im
not
surprised
that
this
was
a
good
beer
southern
tier
puts
out
lots
of
good
stuff
this
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
scent
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
spice
and
fruit
the
taste
is
strong
and
bold
but
has
great
complex
flavors
there
is
a
great
blend
of
malts
and
spices
along
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
a
great
brew
for
those
cold
winter
months
extremetly
bold
in
the
baking
spices
like
drinking
spiced
soup
nose
was
pleasant
but
way
too
overwhelming
in
the
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
good
well
balanced
and
overall
a
really
good
beer
just
a
little
heavy
on
the
spices
i
have
had
glogg
in
my
time
and
as
far
as
a
beer
representative
goes
this
is
a
pretty
accurate
rendition
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
and
somehow
the
flavors
harmonize
theres
a
little
bit
of
clashing
that
goes
on
here
and
there
with
some
of
the
more
aggressive
flavors
but
thats
par
for
the
course
fermented
sweetness
a
faint
pine
undertone
slight
warnings
of
a
vodka
and
red
wine
hangover
southern
tier
has
earned
some
more
brownie
points
by
resonating
with
my
semiscandanavian
heart
overall
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
front
of
a
raging
fire
in
the
winter
slow
sipping
but
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
did
taste
like
an
intense
christmas
cookie
so
given
the
name
i
think
they
hit
their
mark
i
do
think
however
that
the
spices
could
have
been
toned
down
a
bit
to
let
some
of
the
malty
flavors
come
out
i
think
it
compares
reasonably
well
to
other
christmas
beers
out
there
though
overall
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
deep
bloodamber
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
cloudy
offwhite
head
that
coats
the
surface
aromas
of
heavy
spicing
and
fruit
with
a
rich
sweet
cherry
and
berries
backbone
giving
rise
to
allspice
coriander
and
fennel
smells
very
festive
and
warm
flavors
are
rich
and
roasty
with
a
cinnamon
and
cider
theme
cherry
cordial
and
licorice
form
the
base
of
the
brew
with
the
allspice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
filling
the
rest
of
the
palate
candied
overtones
with
an
evergreen
highlight
throughout
its
like
yankee
candle
made
a
holiday
beer
flavor
in
drinking
form
screams
christmas
time
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
a
linger
of
the
spicing
with
a
strong
herbal
tea
characteristic
filmy
slightly
lingering
finish
to
the
brew
overall
you
dont
really
notice
the
8
abv
while
drinking
which
makes
it
easier
to
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
in
turn
keeping
you
nice
and
toasty
on
those
cold
winter
nights
interesting
brew
o
it
was
ok
nice
to
sip
on
its
own
at
a
holiday
party
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
there
are
plenty
of
other
great
holiday
beers
out
there
to
drink
instead
o
overall
the
8
0
abv
seems
gentle
at
first
but
does
provide
a
cough
medicine
like
flair
upon
warming
the
spicing
while
event
toned
and
refined
seesm
more
supplementary
hiding
in
the
background
the
malting
is
good
this
drank
more
like
a
bock
with
some
fruity
tones
d
not
too
shabby
of
a
holiday
brew
lots
of
residual
sweetness
and
holiday
spice
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
to
me
enjoy
during
the
right
week
and
you
will
be
happy
o
too
heavy
on
the
nutmeg
and
the
cinnamon
to
really
enjoy
i
had
high
hopes
but
after
2
the
last
4
of
the
pack
are
going
to
be
given
away
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
the
smell
is
cinnamon
sweet
and
roasted
malt
spices
and
flavors
such
as
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
one
is
over
the
top
and
if
your
not
an
adventure
seeking
beer
drinking
look
elsewhere
oa
solid
winter
brew
very
spice
heavy
which
hurt
the
balance
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
figs
nutmeg
and
spice
in
the
taste
light
spice
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
dry
faint
fruitiness
of
figs
and
raisins
a
mellow
spice
bite
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fruitiness
of
figs
and
spice
in
the
aftertaste
a
small
spice
and
dark
fruits
quite
a
sleeper
o
not
a
bad
holiday
spiced
beer
that
showcases
the
spices
but
has
enough
balance
to
still
drinkable
i
was
nervous
when
about
the
brewers
description
saying
this
is
double
spiced
but
is
isnt
as
strongly
spiced
as
other
beers
i
have
both
commercial
and
homebrewed
the
rest
quite
spicy
but
with
enough
body
underneath
to
make
it
tolerable
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
im
usually
impressed
with
southern
tier
beers
they
always
seem
to
be
spoton
challenging
and
very
rewarding
unfortunately
thats
not
the
case
with
2xmas
its
a
clear
reddish
colored
liquid
with
a
thin
tan
head
medium
carbonation
the
smell
is
fruit
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
in
the
background
the
fruit
is
hard
to
place
the
label
says
fig
but
im
getting
a
lot
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
the
peelrind
theme
plays
into
the
taste
as
well
which
is
also
full
of
fruit
and
spice
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
former
as
well
as
the
latter
firm
body
good
balance
the
beer
just
doesnt
really
come
together
though
the
bitterness
is
distracting
not
bad
just
not
up
to
my
expectations
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
aromas
of
pine
clove
cinnamon
and
citrus
zest
aroma
a
little
yeast
flavors
of
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
anise
and
roasty
malts
tartness
and
warmth
is
certainly
supplied
by
abv
and
malt
medium
mouthfeel
along
with
some
soft
carbonation
throughout
finish
offers
a
doughy
feel
and
a
spicy
taste
overall
a
really
nice
holiday
surprise
for
2012

and
bready
malts
with
herbs
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
follows
well
with
caramel
bread
malts
brown
sugar
and
more
spices
mostly
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
again
which
perfectly
go
with
the
season
medium
body
ad
light
to
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
seasonal
not
all
that
different
from
many
of
this
genre
as
a
winter
release
but
still
good
nonetheless
o
ive
never
had
swedish
glogg
but
i
can
imagine
this
being
an
accurate
representation
of
the
style
because
it
goes
well
with
cold
weather
the
flavors
are
strong
as
is
the
abv
but
it
comes
together
to
make
a
good
beer
for
the
season
one
bottle
is
enough
though
and
im
glad
i
didnt
get
a
6pack
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
little
more
complexity
and
balance
than
i
normally
find
in
this
style
i
thought
that
worked
pretty
well
with
this
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavor
held
my
attention
but
i
dont
think
that
i
would
want
to
follow
it
up
with
another
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
its
pretty
intense
with
lots
of
spices
going
on
like
i
said
it
smells
like
christmas
in
a
glass
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
i
could
go
with
out
the
stickyness
i
would
buy
a
couple
bottles
for
christmas
next
year
but
this
isnt
a
beer
ill
be
really
stocking
up
on
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
good
spiced
christmas
ale
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
pretty
fitting
for
the
holiday
season
and
the
aroma
and
taste
seemed
to
embody
christmas
in
beer
form
southern
tier
seems
to
be
a
pretty
solid
brewery
and
i
think
all
three
beers
in
the
2x
series
are
good
i
hope
to
see
some
new
beers
added
to
this
series
good
job
southern
tier
this
is
a
nice
holiday
brew
it
makes
me
want
to
throw
some
logs
in
the
fireplace
o
this
has
become
my
favorite
holiday
beer
this
season
it
was
hard
to
find
but
worth
the
search
it
is
a
rare
find
to
have
a
holiday
beer
that
you
can
come
back
to
over
and
over
without
just
a
one
off
that
was
fun
now
back
to
a
real
beer
attitude
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
holiday
spice
and
malt
slight
alcohol
notes
tastes
similarly
rich
caramel
malts
up
front
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
character
slight
alcoholic
taste
towards
the
finish
along
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
hop
bitterness
is
almost
nonexistent
so
this
beer
is
unbalanced
and
malty
however
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
for
the
style
this
beer
does
a
fine
job
very
good
beer
for
the
cold
winter
season
very
drinkable
medium
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
winter
seasonal
for
those
cold
nights
2xmas
ale
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
decent
size
lacing
head
there
are
strong
hints
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
figs
aroma
there
is
a
strong
malty
backbone
with
lots
of
spices
mixing
together
tastes
like
ginger
snap
cookie
easy
to
drink
and
full
flavor
overall
a
fantastic
christmas
style
ale
full
flavor
sweet
and
a
bit
unique
o
superb
christmas
beer
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
ive
had
o
nice
take
on
the
winter
warmer
style
i
like
how
the
addition
of
orange
peel
brightens
up
the
darker
fruit
flavors
overy
unique
holiday
beer
the
pine
is
something
that
is
typical
of
christmas
but
i
havent
found
in
many
holiday
beers
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
tastes
like
dark
fruit
jam
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
on
cinnamon
raisin
bread
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
finishes
with
holiday
spice
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
an
awesome
beer
with
complimentary
flavors
that
really
work
well
together
the
flavors
are
actually
kind
of
mild
which
makes
it
a
nice
supper
cant
detect
the
alcohol
at
all
o
overall
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
christmas
beer
ive
had
this
year
better
than
anchor
christmas
as
that
stuff
is
just
too
spiced
and
not
quite
as
sweet
as
anderson
valley
winter
solstice
just
a
really
sophisticated
top
quality
christmas
ale
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
o
not
sure
what
swedish
glogg
tastes
like
but
this
is
pretty
good
a
very
christmasy
beer
overall
the
spice
character
was
not
as
offputting
as
some
theres
good
balance
of
the
various
spices
as
opposed
to
some
that
are
more
dominant
in
one
spice
that
said
its
still
a
spice
bomb
the
bready
malt
counters
the
spices
fairly
well
but
the
sweetness
is
also
over
the
top
d
this
southern
tier
offering
screams
christmas
beer
in
a
good
way
if
it
werent
for
the
medicinal
notes
on
the
palate
this
would
be
a
top
notch
seasonal
offering
in
its
current
form
its
a
very
nice
brew
and
likely
worthy
of
a
six
pack
investment
each
and
every
holiday
season
overall
cant
say
i
am
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
dont
like
overly
sweet
beers
and
this
is
one
of
them
in
fact
i
prefer
anchors
holiday
beer
over
this
not
something
im
likely
to
pick
up
again

very

exactly
what
a

be
overall
this
beer
just
screams
christmas
with
its
crazy
spices
and
ultra
sweet
core
but
i
think
it
is
great
o
not
good
kinda
like
drinking
beer
that
someone
had
poured
potpourri
into
poured
the
last
of
it
down
the
drain
deep

in
color

near

followed
by
a

with
a
wonderfully
balances
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
middle
and
a
spicy
finish
southern
tier
brews
always
have
nice
character
overall
a
very
spicy
holiday
beer
well
hidden
abv
and
lots
of
malt
good
choice
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
holiday
beer
o
tried
this
beer
at
both
room
temp
and
out
of
the
fridge
to
warm
along
the
way
and
it
represented
well
at
all
temperatures
a
nice
holiday
beer
in
the
same
spirit
as
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
nice
warming
easy
compliment
to
most
holiday
dishes
great
for
easy
drinking
with
a
little
more
heart
and
holiday
ambience
than
a
pale
or
yearround
beer
overall
an
excellent
christmas
seasonal
all
the
smells
and
tastes
of
christmas
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
warming
finish
overall
not
much
alcohol
warmth
plenty
of
holiday
spice
a
tad
bitter
good
sweater
weather
beer
oid
call
this
a
winter
warmer
its
an
okay
beer
though
i
expect
more
from
southern
tier
i
got
a
bit
too
excited
when
i
first
saw
this
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
when
st
names
a
beer
2xmas
i
expect
it
to
taste
completely
like
christmas
im
not
sure
what
that
would
be
but
it
wasnt
this
beer
definitely
a
decent
drinker
though
im
glad
i
got
this
but
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
again
the
nose
is
where
this
beer
should
stay
do
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
elevated
abv
of
this
8

overall
this
is

you

o
definitely
one

the
best
christmas
ales
ive
had
beautifully

dangerously
delicious
try
a
bottle
fresh
and
then
put
another
bottle
away
for
a
few
months
and
then
try
it
again
i
plan
on
doing
so
except
that
the
next
bottle
i
buy
ill
promptly

it

i
suppose
this
tastes
pretty
close
to
what
i
would
expect
out
of
a
christmas
beer
from
southern
tier
and
thats
a
good
thing
tastespicy

cinnamon
underlying

a
nice
match
for
a
plate
of
christmas
cookies
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
delivers
what
it
advertises
as
a
christmasy
spiced
holiday
ale
sometimes
the
spices
are
horribly
overdone
mainly
with
clove
or
ginger
but
here
they
are
restrained
and
work
in
balance
with
each
other
and
the
base
beer
2xmas
is
your
quintessential
winter
warmer
thats
designed
for
those
christmas
parties
and
with
the
alcohol
strength
to
sooth
the
mind
it
may
just
make
the
office
party
tolerable
this
year
now
off
to
find
those
damn
sugarplums
o
hope
this
becomes
an
annual
offering
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
beers
best
to
let
it
warm
a
little
though
to
let
the
mintiness
blend
in
with
the
other
spices
singed
caramel
up

slight

overtaken
by

a
very
nice
not

winter
warmer
heated
differences
heated
on
the
stovetop
the
head
was
the
creamiest
of
all
with
better
retention
and
lacing
present
aromas
gave
more
of
a
nod
to
the
dark
fruits
figs
than
the
spices
the
taste
when
heated
became
significantly
more
bitter
and
astringent
not
pleasant
aftertastes
are
dominated
by
burnt
roasted
flavors
overall
the
heated
version
was
my
least
favorite
and
was
not
something
id
want
to
repeat
o
great
beer
would
recommend
a
six
pack
every
holiday
season
i
will
100
be
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
many
times
over
the
cold
months
and
might
have
to
buy
another
sixer
soon
overall
i
would
say
its
a
crowd
pleaser
i
had
a
try
from
another
bottle
and
this
beer
was
amazing
this
time
around
it
was
more
bland
and
thin
not
great
for
the
price
but
not
awful
at
the
same
time
wouldnt
buy
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
thats
not
to
say
that
it
wasnt
here
since
i
could
certainly
feel
a
slight
buzz
by
the
end
of
my
session
nice
job
on
southern
tier
here
not
only
with
the
beer
but
for
coming
out
with
something
spiced
that
made
me
forget
about
all
of
the
similar
beers
that
lined
the
store
shelves
in
the
weeks
leading
up
to
halloween
got
a
nice
crumb
cake
or
bowl
full
of
sugar
cookies
at
home
get
this
to
go
with
em
theyll
pair
up
quite
nicely
this
beer
is
typical
yet
unique
it
has
all
of
the
traditional
winter
spices
like
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
ginger
but
the
dark
fruit
makes
all
the
difference
this
beer
has
complexities
subtleties
nuances
its
really
a
well
made
beer
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
very
enjoyable
holiday
seasonal
with
a
good
spicy
taste
will
drink
again
a
wonderful
winter
seasonal
brew
with
a
bite
i
dont
taste
the
figs
as
much
as
as
orange
peel
and
nutmeg
it
definitely
hits
the
mark
as
an
xmas
beer
quite
drinkable
on
its
own
and
wonderful
with
a
warm
bowl
of
curry
pleasant
carbonation
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
normally
like
but
you
cant
tell
this
is
a
triple
caliber
abv
would
definitely
buy
again
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
though
medium
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
and
a
heavy
spice
presence
thats
countered
by
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
medicinal
syrupy
flavor
this
medicinal
flavor
tends
to
be
overwhelming
in
holiday
beers
its
kept
in
check
here
by
the
other
characteristics
lots
of
cinnamon
pepper
allspice
and
clove
along
with
cherry
cough
drop
and
other
dark
berries
slight
alcohol
sweetness
but
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
with
little
to
no
heat
a
little
heavy
on
the
spices
but
its
a
pretty
good
holiday
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
like
the
old
man
winter
one
a
little
bit
better
than
this
but
overall
a
great
festive
brew
at
8abv
you
cant
go
wrong
and
the
high
octane
isnt
even
noticeable
so
thats
a
plus
o
pretty
much
the
holiday
verision
of
pumking
tons
of
in
your
face
seasonal
flavors
good
beer
that
may
be
tough
to
drink
multiples
of
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
fig
really
overspiced
and
somewhat
cloying
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
dark
brownmahogany
color
with
a
fair
tan
head
that
holds
as
a
thin
cover
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
a
definite
holiday
theme
with
sweet
evergreen
and
light
licorice
malt
very
nice
for
a
christmas
brew
the
flavor
follows
with
plenty
of
juniper
nutmeg
and
cereal
malt
sweet
spiciness
and
pretty
thick
malt
presence
a
good
mix
with
medium
body
and
a
resinous
feel
modest
carbonation
a
great
seasonal
brew
that
further
confirms
my
continued
faith
in
southern
tier
bravo
overall
i
loved
this
great
beer
and
its
perfect
for
the
holiday
season
perfect
amount
of
dry
fruit
flavoring
to
go
along
with
the
smell
tastes
like
dessert
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
day
will
definitely
have
this
many
times
again
maybe
im
just
not
cut
out
for
most
winter
ales
but
that
cinnamonnutmeg
combination
really
just
does
not
taste
good
to
me
it
tends
to
emphasize
the
booze
turn
into
a
weird
halfbaked
fruitcake
sort
of
flavor
that
said
i
dont
dislike
all
christmas
ales
but
theres
a
certain
cocktail
of
spices
that
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
too
bad
because
i
really
dug
that
aroma
taste
starts
with
figs
then
some
faint
toasted
orange
peel
middle
has
roasted
malts
toasted
figs
and
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
spices
arent
as
dominant
with
the
flavor
as
they
are
with
aroma
the
palate
is
a
little
syrupy
sweet
overall
and
a
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
do
add
to
the
glogglike
affect
of
this
beer
if
you
like
spiced
beers
this
one
is
worth
trying
for
sure
or
if
you
like
the
taste
of
liquid
xmas
pick
up
a
sixer
2xmas
is
a
nice
spiced
ale
and
is
a
good
brew
to
celebrate
the
holiday
season
2xmas
goes
in
the
glass
a
dark
chestnut
brown
shade
that
is
able
to
be
seen
through
not
to
much
activity
on
the
top
just
a
sparse
amount
of
off
white
bubbles
that
die
down
quick
eventually
the
beer
looks
dead
smell
gives
me
a
mix
of
a
spiced
beer
and
a
winter
warmer
the
fig
representation
is
large
behind
that
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
scents
plum
and
light
chocolate
more
spice
with
warming
this
takes
some
sips
to
get
used
to
off
put
by
the
large
fig
presense
the
caramelchocolate
malt
combo
comes
through
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
spicy
finish
hops
are
minimal
and
not
making
a
dent
body
is
smooth
and
a
healthy
medium
with
almost
no
carbonation
down
the
gullet
this
one
is
nearing
flat
i
think
maybe
this
is
intentional
in
the
glogg
tradition
while
i
enjoyed
this
i
dont
see
myself
making
this
a
tradition
good
for
the
season
though
would
probably
pair
well
with
some
christmas
ham
never
having
a
swedish
glogg
i
am
now
intrigued
to
try
one
out
2xmas
is
a
pretty
good
holiday
release
its
definitely
spicier
than
a
winter
warmer
frankly
its
a
bit
too
spicy
for
me
as
far
as
holiday
beers
go
its
worth
grabbing
a
six
pack
there
are
a
ton
of
great
holiday
releases
though
this
ones
solid
but
doesnt
do
a
great
job
of
distinguishing
itself
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
and
caramel
malt
and
lots
of
holiday
spicing
cinnamon
cloves
ginger
and
a
slight
cola
element
flavor
follows
taste
with
a
substantial
sweet
malt
body
with
a
nice
mixture
of
spices
dominated
by
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
somewhat
nutty
excellent
medium
body
with
pleasant
creaminess
a
nice
warming
winter
beer
not
sure
why
this
isnt
a
winter
warmer
rather
than
herbedspiced
beer
but
it
does
well
on
both
counts
not
that
blown
away
by
this
one
flavor
and
smell
seem
a
bit
strange
ill
stick
to
old
man
winter
or
krampus
for
their
winter
seasonals
overall
i
think
the
spices
and
hops
made
the
finish
too
bitter
the
sweeter
flavors
needed
to
be
featured
a
bit
more
o
a
fine
beer
i
prefer
a
little
less
spice
in
my
winter
seasonals
but
i
would
definitely
not
turn
down
one
if
offered
to
me
a
pretty
clear
reddishbrown
body
with
a
small
eggshell
cap
some
dots
and
lines
of
lace
inside
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
baked
dark
bread
dark
candi
sugar
toffee
caramel
figs
orange
peel
cinnamon
and
coriander
on
the
palate
the
figs
and
toffeecaramel
flavors
lay
a
foundation
for
the
spices
and
orange
peel
to
do
work
the
finish
is
dry
from
the
candi
sugar
with
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
and
some
of
the
bready
malt
to
try
and
balance
it
out
medium
body
a
bit
syrupy
this
is
a
nice
little
christmas
ale
that
surprised
me
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
tightly
wound
into
a
wellcrafted
ale
for
the
season
strong
christmasy
aroma
with
an
overwhelming
cinnamon
smell
overall
good
mix
in
taste
strong
warm
after
taste
definitely
a
quality
holiday
brew
overall
a
very
enjoyable
holiday
beer
the
warming
effect
was
great
i
just
made
a
batch
of
glogg
and
i
love
it
but
this
just
isnt
all
that
good
way
to
spice
heavy
like
chewing
on
potpourri
or
sipping
on
your
grandmothers
candle
a
dark
and
murky
brown
orange
appearance
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
beer
is
very
christmasy
an
absolute
ton
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
there
is
also
clove
and
perhaps
all
spice
the
malts
are
quite
caramel
and
toffee
based
and
are
very
subtle
and
are
mere
accents
to
all
the
beers
spices
the
feel
is
rather
big
and
syrupy
to
this
brew
it
is
a
sipping
winter
beer
that
isnt
quick
to
go
down
this
is
on
par
with
great
lakes
chrismas
ale
in
terms
of
taste
this
is
a
very
very
christmasy
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
this
would
be
excellent
to
baste
a
ham
mix
it
up
with
some
brown
sugar
and
reduce
it
then
glaze
that
ham
man
i
love
a
good
malty
winter
warmer
and
this
one
is
a
beaut
the
2xmas
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
very
small
beige
head
the
head
leaves
some
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
spices
including
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
allspice
and
a
hint
of
ginger
this
is
one
of
the
most
aromatic
beers
i
have
ever
encountered
the
flavor
is
syrupy
sweet
just
a
touch
of
hops
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
smooth
texture
and
medium
body
a
rather
dry
finish
for
the
style
kept
me
ready
for
every
sip
another
quality
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
overall
i
feel
that
this
has
qualities
that
would
win
people
over
even
if
they
are
not
fans
of
spice
beers
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
belgian
style
dark
ales
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
o
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
warmerspiced

beer
category
nice
and
warming
at
8

this
spiced
brew
allows
you
to
get
warm
and
cozy
without
tipping
over
into
the
realm
of
complex
winter
sipper
no
overwhelmingly
good
qualities
but
some
interesting
strong
winter
characteristics
overall
really
tasty
holiday
brew
lots
of
malty
sweetness
and
enough
holiday
spice
one
of
their
better
small
bottle
beers
i
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
little
too
much
grut
beer
flavour
for
me
not
one
of
my
favourite
tasting
style
of
beer
unfortunately
still
pretty
festive
and
tasting
and
its
probably
worth
having
at
least
one
of
these
this
holiday
season
overall
worth
picking
up
if
you
love
the
pumpkin
spice
fall
beers
or
heavily
spiced
christmas
beers
these
guys
know
how
to
brew
great
beer
theyve
all
been
spectacular
d
this
beer
screams
christmas
this
is
how
i
remember
great
lakes
christmas
tasting
years
ago
although
i
had
it
recently
and
it
tasted
like
a
spice
mess
not
sure
if
the
beer
changed
or
my
palette
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
love
figs
and
had
a
hard
time
picking
them
out
dothis
is
a
great
lakes
christmas
clone
that
beats
its
inspiration
at
its
own
game
its
novelty

full
of

to

a
very
interesting
brew
thats
great
for
the
season
has
the
spiciness
that
i
look
for
yet
with
a
nice
drinkabilty
and
a
high
abv
cloudstrife0
will
not
buy
or
drink
again
nice
ginger
aroma
and
flavor
very
refreshing
this
is
probably
my
favorite
session
able
beer
especially
in
the
summer
o
i
bought
this
as
something
different
and
really
wanted
to
like
this
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
but
leaves
much
to
be
desired
i
was
expecting
a
well
rounded
beer
but
this
just
tastes
an
attempt
to
create
something
different
for
the
sake
of
being
different
though
it
has
a
strong
ginger
taste
as
you
drink
more
it
feels
unbalanced
and
unrefined
the
body
feels
too
thin
without
much
complexity
if
your
expecting
ginger
you
get
it
i
dont
really
think
i
would
try
this
again
unless
it
was
free
juju
is
a
seasonal
beer
that
i
usually
look
forward
to
but
now
it
seems
lack
luster
its
missing
the
spices
that
one
would
expect
out
of
a
good
ginger
beer
maybe
a
little
watered
too
its
still
a
low
abv
beer
that
i
dont
mind
saving
for
warmer
days
in
the
springtime
though
prob
not
11
a
6
pack
worthy
either
if
i
may
say
so
very
weak
and
watery
but
has
slight
ginger
flavor
and
it
is
very
refreshing
summer
food
beer
the
taste
is
very
good
i
expected
ginger
but
this
is
really
tasty
with
fresh
spice
and
citrus
with
subtle
malt
sweetness
to
back
it
up
and
the
mild
lemon
element
with
ginger
continuing
in
a
mild
way
throughout
with
clean
yeast
and
light
toasted
flavor
in
the
malt
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
tropical
quality
and
refreshing
taste
in
this
sessionable
ale
recommended
if
you
enjoy
a
summerrefresher
type
of
ginger
beer
i
would
drink
this
frequently
light
refreshing
beer
great
use
of
ginger
a
bold
honey
gold
liquid
with
a
lovely
lacey
foam
topping
with
excellent
sticky
lacing
as
it
dissapates
ginger
in
the
nose
very
sweet
and
fruity
and
spicy
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
upfront
ginger
but
never
with
that
vinegarkick
most
people
associate
with
sushi
ginger
this
is
the
essence
of
ginger
not
overpowring
low
hops
quite
paletteable
this
is
an
unusual
flavor
and
it
goes
great
with
asian
food
because
of
the
ginger
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
look
to
this
one
very
light
on
the
alcohol
but
still
very
flavorful
and
not
what
youre
used
to

great
crisp
taste
very
subtle
ginger
right
up
my
alley
very
refreshing
the
ginger
only
hit
me
on
the
nose
and
first
taste
then
it
turns
into
a
nice
ale
different
and
fun
nice
light
and
effervescent
you
definitely
taste
the
ginger
but
its
not
overwhelming
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
a
pleasant
bit
of
citrus
too
very
good
brew
overall
very
interesting
and
not
everyones
beer
if
you
like
spice
beer
or
any
foodbeverage
with
ginger
be
sure
to
check
this
out
this
flavor
profile
is
just
not
for
me
the
ginger
is
very
strong
and
upfront
i
usaly
like
left
hand
stuff
oh
well
glad
it
was
just
a
single
o
there
is
a
good
balance
here
interesting
brew
but
nothing
monumental
not
bad

clear
amber
pour
that
has
just
a
touch
of
garnet
with
an
acceptable
head
lacing
and
retention
are
typical
for
the
style
and
fade
away
after
a
few
minutes
the
magnificent
nose
is
of
ginger
over
a
biscuit
background
sweetness
light
medium
body
that
is
nice
and
smooth
in
texture
above
average
carbonation
with
a
strong
burst
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
and
focuses
on
ginger
it
delivers
the
ginger
at
just
the
right
level
and
balances
it
against
a
toasty
slight
biscuit
sweetness
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
effervescent
burst
of
ginger
and
hop
flavor
over
biscuit
an
outstanding
clean
crisp
use
of
ginger
in
all
honesty
i
dont
get
it
it
seems
like
an
amateur
offering
one
that
could
use
some
tweaking
before
hitting
the
bottling
line
if
you
like
light
ales
that
border
on
watery
but
have
nuances
of
spiciness
and
onenote
of
ginger
then
i
guess
you
should
get
yourself
some
othat
good
juju
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
couldve
benefited
from
a
little
more
depthcomplexity
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
not
the
worst
beer
ive
rated
probably
wouldnt
purposefully
choose
it
again
o
this
is
the
second
ginger
beer
ive
ever
had
the
other
was
way
too
heavy
on
the
ginger
this
one
balances
it
pretty
well
i
wouldnt
seek
try
again
but
it
was
nice
to
see
what
it
was
like
o
i
love
ginger
and
i
commend
left
hands
usage
of
it
in
this
beer
its
real
good
right
now
it
is
80
degrees
outside
and
i
about
chugged
half
the
glass
in
a
couple
minutes
this
beer
is
fantastic
while
in
the
recommended
4045
degree
range
once
it
started
warming
up
it
started
losing
its
pop
but
i
will
say
it
is
crazy
drinkable
in
this
weather
odrinks
almost
like
a
dry
club
soda
with
ginger
very
interesting
brew
and
i
honestly
enjoyed
that
it
wasnt
complicated
by
a
lot
of
other
flavors
or
sweetness
perhaps
a
ginger
beer
is
not
my
forte
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
ginger
root
even
on
sushi
but
this
seemed
to
have
a
weakness
and
one
dimensionality
that
just
didnt
sell
the
color
was
light
and
watery
but
presented
a
thick
fluffy
head
the
aroma
and
taste
were
the
same
as
ginger
pervades
with
a
watery
herb
twangy
finish
perhaps
ginger
beer
is
not
my
forte
oh
yeah
i
already
said
that
perky
cheerful
and
just
lovely
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
it
definitely
deserves
the
right
food
pairing
to
go
with
it
though
im
thinking
ill
have
a
few
with
my
next
trip
to
my
favorite
thai
restaurant
with
that
being
said
i
cant
see
it
being
a
staple
in
my
refrigerator
for
the
season
it
will
however
be
an
interesting
diversion
from
the
same
session
ales
i
normally
take
to
get
togethers
overall
the
smell
made
it
worth
it
otherwise
i
was
pretty
uninterested
i
doubt
ill
have
again
odnot
a
fan
i
enjoy
ginger
with
my
sushi
as
do
i
love
me
some
ginger
ale
keep
it
away
from
my
beer
though
overall
a
grownup
ginger
ale
not
bad
but
not
something
that
i
would
try
again
pure
simple
natural
ingredients
rocky
mountain
water
malted
barley
hops
yeast
and
organic
ginger
this
beer
tastes
like
ginger
ale
for
grownups
it
is
more
delicate
than
i
expected
balancing
the
carbonation
malt
and
ginger
to
make
it
taste
quite
honestly
more
like
a
real
soda
that
isnt
too
sweet
its
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
summer
beer
if
you
like
ginger
ale
3
5
d
i
will
probably
drink
this
more
than
my
scores
suggest
while
it
isnt
a
great
beer
overall
it
has
a
lot
of
ginger
in
it
which
is
a
flavor
i
cant
get
enough
of
o
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
real
ginger
ale
not
the
sweetened
stuff
like
canada
dry
of
schweppes
with
a
very
light
amount
of
ginger
spiciness
but
enough
to
be
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
with
a
low
abv
this
would
pair
well
with
asian
foods
and
could
be
sessionable
in
the
right
pairing
o
pretty
much
a
pale
ale
with
ginger
the
ginger
is
incorporated
nicely
adding
flavor
without
becoming
overbearing
a
refreshing
quaff
that
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
and
humid
night
this
is
another
pleasant
surprise
for
the
summer
i
am
a
fan
of
ginger
so
i
tend
to
pick
up
ginger
beersales
when
i
see
them
most
of
them
tend
to
be
of
the
novelty
variety
that
no
matter
how
much
i
might
enjoy
them
i
never
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
one
is
different
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
i
spent
most
of
my
early
beer
drinking
summers
with
a
tecate
and
lime
this
has
the
same
refreshment
with
out
the
skunk
this
beer
makes
me
want
some
sushi
nothing
much
going
beyond
the
pickled
ginger
flavor
though
if
its
a
hot
day
and
you
love
the
taste
of
ginger
then
this
guy
is
a
really
easy
drinker
and
at
4
its
an
easily
manageable
session
beer
if
you
dont
like
ginger
id
stay
away
because
youre
not
gonna
find
anything
else
to
review
from
this
beer
othere
is
not
much
going
with
this
brew
once
you
move
past
the
ginger
flavor
i
understand
that
this
is
a
warmweather
sessiontype
beer
but
the
ginger
is
a
bit
cloying
for
allday
drinking
and
regardless
of
the
summertime
intentions
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
beermalt
backbone
to
support
the
surprisingly
real
ginger
flavor
here
save
this
brew
for
the
hottest
dog
days
of
summertime
o
people
will
either
love
or
hate
this
based
on
their
preference
for
the
spice
i
thought
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
that
does
one
thing
and
does
it
very
well
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
best
before

pours
lightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
light
foamy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
lemon
zest
ginger
honey
bread
floral
grass
light
clove
light

and
herbal

nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good

with
good

on
the

for
a
short
bit
nice
balance
of

and
light
hop
flavors
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
robustness
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
no
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
as
expected
overall
this
is
a
nice
spiced
session
beer
good
balance
of
malt
ginger
and
hop
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
this
may
be
light
this
may
be
low
in
alcohol
this
may
be
simple
and
just
citrusy
but
it
surely
is
refreshing
and
tasty
this
could
be
a
great
summertime
session
beer
much
better
than
your
runofthemill
lawnmower
beer
very
fine
flavors
and
superb
drinkability
great
with
food
i
enjoyed
this
give
it
a
try
pours
an
orangish
golden
with
a
slight
white
head
smell
is
pretty
much
straight
up
pickled
ginger
like
i
what
you
get
at
a
sushi
bar
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
is
hiding
out
in
there
too
though
flavor
follows
suit
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
the
beer
is
bright
crisp
and
refreshing
but
you
better
love
pickled
ginger
to
dig
this
unfortunately
for
me
i
dont
like
picked
ginger
you
know
this
is
rated
pretty
low
outside
of
beeradvocate
but
you
know
what
although
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
a
decent
beer
i
only
bought
one
bottle
at
a
store
where
i
usually
buy
a
bunch
of
singles
but
had
i
bought
a
6pack
i
wouldnt
be
upset
i
dont
always
have
the
best
vocabulary
when
describing
beers
but
i
can
at
least
say
that
im
not
one
to
favor
one
style
too
much
over
another
and
ive
tried
over
a
thousand
different
beers
although
ive
only
rated
a
few
and
this
one
doesnt
belong
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
maybe
just
below
the
middle
not
bad
the
beer
pours
a
clear
honeygolden
color
with
almost
no
head
or
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
spicy
profoundly
gingery
with
a
touch
of
molasseslike
sweetness
the
taste
is
as
expected
with
good
malt
sweetness
playing
off
the
ginger
like
a
ginger
snap
unfortunately
this
beer
was
severely
undercarbonated
and
came
across
as
being
a
bit
too
syrupy
it
also
lacked
the
ginger
bite
that
i
was
expecting
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
worth
trying
probably
pairs
well
with
many
spicy
food
options
but
isnt
a
repeat
overall
very
refreshing
and
a
good
summer
beer
if
youre
not
into
ginger
stay
away
but
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
flavor
can
only
imagine
pairing
this
with
some
thai
food
probably
the
first
gingertype
beer
ive
tried
but
i
didnt
hate
it
id
probably
try
it
again
ofirst
time
ive
had
the
style
and
its
not
too
bad
a
good
unique
session
beer
overall
this
comes
across
as
a
rather
watery
pale
ale
into
which
a
large
dollop
of
ginger
has
been
added
the
ginger
notes
by
themselves
are
nice
but
could
use
a
stronger
support
group
on
the
other
hand
the
ginger
and
weaker
beer
notes
mean
this
would
make
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
plateful
of
sushi
and
the
overall
lightness
makes
for
decent
summer
fare
i
got
my
growler
filled
with
this
yesterday
at
my
local
beer
store
i
have
never
had
a
ginger
beer
before
i
actually
like
this
a
pretty
good
bit
the
smell
is
pretty
packed
with
ginger
the
taste
is
good
too
i
think
there
is
a
nice
little
ginger
taste
here
also
the
only
complaint
that
i
have
is
that
there
is
a
pretty
week
finish
i
would
like
for
the
flavor
to
push
on
through
but
over
all
this
is
a
worthy
effort
a
soso
beer
could
stand
to
have
more
ginger
to
it
nothing
bad
about
it
but
it
just
feels
bland
worth
trying
if
you
like
beers
flavored
with
ginger
but
probably
not
otherwise
an
interesting
but
ultimately
not
very
drinkable
beer
i
certainly
would
never
buy
a
6pack
of
this
even
if
i
were
looking
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
it
just
doesnt
strike
that
balance
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
something
i
really
care
for
the
body
is
way
too
thin
and
watery
and
there
isnt
any
malt
to
back
up
the
taste
it
needs
more
residual
sweetness
and
body
if
they
adjusted
the
recipe
to
do
that
it
could
potentially
attract
some
of
the
ginger
ale
crowd
i
had
a
little
bit
of
high
hopes
for
this
beer
cause
i
am
a
fan
of
left
hand
brewing
but
alas
i
was
left
unfulfilled
and
disappointed
there
is
no
body
and
very
little
flavor
there
was
the
essence
of
ginger
but
that
quickly
disapeared
a
bit
of
ginger
in
the
aroma
but
overall
this
beer
was
lackluster
if
not
for
that
little
essence
of
ginger
this
beer
would
be
completely
bland
long
story
short
i
will
probably
never
have
this
beer
again
you
keep
wanting
to
go
in
to
get
that
initial
flavor
but
it
dissipates
so
fast
and
really
needs
to
be
more
well
rounded
decent
ale
overall
o
eh
mediocre
at
best
i
would
not
actively
seek
this
beer
out
review
from
22010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
yellow
amber
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
of
ginger
and
faint
malt
flavor
is
very
dry
with
a
hint
of
honey
with
ginger
at
the
start
then
just
ginger
finishing
with
a
dry
faint
light
hop
and
lager
malt
flavor
the
ginger
is
nice
but
little
else
going
on
light
bodied
how
much
enjoyment
is
had
from
those
beer
depends
on
how
much
you
like
ginger
great
beer
smell
and
taste
of
ginger
really
is
so
soothing
nothing
special
about
the
appearance
or
mouthful
but
it
lives
up
to
the
name
it
is
given
good
juju
i
think
ill
be
drinking
some
more
good
juju
soon
and
often
left
hand
does
it
again
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
ginger
you
might
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
ginger
drink
its
actually
quite
enjoyable
but
as
a
beer
it
fails
in
several
respects
o
overall
though
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
alot
more
ginger
but
instead
i
have
a
much
more
malt
heavy
beer
than
i
prefer
oh
well
for
the
2
it
cost
me
its
not
too
bad
pours
a
hazed
golden
color
fizzy
white
foam
cap
stays
a
while
and
leaves
some
rings
of
lace
in
the
smell
herbs
lemongrass
ginger
and
wheat
a
bit
of
a
bready
smell
lingers
and
the
ginger
is
right
there
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
solid
dose
of
ginger
herbal
tea
lemon
grass
and
earthy
hop
notes
there
is
definitely
some
citrus
and
wheat
malt
flavors
lots
of
ginger
and
a
semi
dry
clean
finish
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
twist
had
it
paired
with
asian
bbq
wings
pretty
decent
overall
interesting
it
almost
doesnt
feel
or
taste
like
a
beer
in
any
way
ill
enjoy
the
sixer
but
wont
be
visiting
this
one
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
seems
to
go
best
with
the
summer
weather
o
not
a
bad
brew
overall
nice
mix
of
ginger
spice
with
the
piney
hops
wouldnt
wanna
have
more
then
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
another
good
job
by
the
guys
at
left
hand
brewing
walking
the
wire
and
experimenting
with
different
flavor
combinations
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
oddly
the
freshness
date
is
blank
on
this
one
this
pours
a
fizzy
short
lived
white
head
this
color
is
an
almost
golden
color
the
smells
are
of
ginger
a
little
sweetness
no
real
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
a
nice
amount
of
ginger
a
little
bitterness
from
the
ginger
okay
not
bad
overall
its
not
really
distributed
around
here
like
every
left
hand
brew
but
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
worth
trying
if
you
like
ginger
ale
o
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
seeing
that
this
was
my
first
herb
beer
i
think
it
was
successful
but
boring
at
the
same
time
flavors
were
good
but
lackluster
i
really
want
to
try
more
of
this
style
to
truly
see
how
this
stacks
up
an
i
will
revisit
it
in
the
future
very
high
d
overall
this
beer
seems
best
suited
to
follow
mowing
your
lawn
or
after
being
in
the
hot
sun
it
has
the
right
balance
of
a
standard
lager
with
a
slight
ginger
twist
its
weaker
than
a
shanty
and
leaves
a
bit
for
any
ginger
beer
lover
o
once
again
i
love
that
the
ginger
shines
the
main
ingredient
should
be
showcased
and
presented
in
its
most
natural
form
in
my
opinion
well
done
overall
this
beer
left
no
positive
impression
on
myself
it
is
comparable
to
a
ginger
flavored
mainstream
lager
such
as
coors
light
etc
i
love
anything
with
ginger
but
could
not
detect
any
ginger
flavor
metallic
smell
that
affected
the
flavor
im
fairly
forgiving
but
this
is
a
real
disappointment
in
order
to
get
to
my
character
minimum
will
add
that
it
is
a
beautiful
evening
along
the
front
range
in
colorado
o
spice
and
ginger
lead
this
brew
in
a
watery
way
its
just
average
and
uneventful
low
abv
makes
it
drinkable
but
not
much
going
on
here
o
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
spice
beer
i
dont
mind
it
but
im
not
sure
im
a
huge
fan
of
ginger
with
that
being
said
its
a
well
made
beer
that
is
mostly
either
love
it
or
hate
it
with
me
im
a
bit
in
between
then
again
theres
probably
a
reason
this
one
sat
in
my
fridge
for
close
to
a
year
very
interesting
brew
made
with
potent
fresh
ginger
in
high
quantities
pours
a
clearish
golden
color
with
the
slightest
copper
hue
and
an
average
thin
white
head
smells
like
fresh
ginger
like
a
canada
dry
ginger
ale
softdrink
no
hops
to
speak
of
here
just
a
sugary
syrupy
ginger
essence
flavor
is
definitely
featuring
the
ginger
but
there
are
some
pale
malts
in
there
to
give
some
body
and
a
gentle
hopping
that
combines
with
the
ginger
for
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
this
isnt
my
favorte
lefthand
beer
but
because
of
its
bright
carbonation
and
refreshing
flavor
it
would
make
a
nice
summer
afternoon
session
i
also
like
it
better
than
any
other
ginger
beers
ive
had
too
strange
for
me
maybe
after
i
finish
all
of
the
six
pack
ill
have
developed
a
taste
for
it
but
not
so
far
pours
a
hazed
gold
lots
of
bubbles
prickly
white
head
gone
quickly
scent
brings
fresh
ground
ginger
root
and
citrus
rind
little
touch
of
acidity
hinted
at
but
little
malt
taste
brings
strong
fresh
ground
ginger
root
mildly
refreshing
touching
on
harsh
adequate
citrus
and
lightly
sweet
malts
splash
of
acidity
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
very
bubbly
alright
brew
not
as
refreshing
as
i
would
have
hoped
from
the
style
o
this
doesnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
there
is
an
odd
sweetness
at
the
end
and
just
too
much
ginger
for
me
overall
i
think
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
im
sure
some
will
enjoy
but
it
just
wasnt
really
for
me
it
is
worth
trying
though
the
toasted
malts
mixed
with
some
earthy
musty
hops
and
the
ginger
make
for
a
musty
earthy
and
light
bodied
beer
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
teh
watery
mouthfeel
but
lacking
in
flavor
o
interesting
beer
tastes
like
a
good
standard
ale
infused
with
gingerbread
or
ginger
candy
being
that
i
like
ginger
i
like
this
beer
taste
is
just
as
boring
i
get
some
almost
metallic
undertones
and
the
ginger
doesnt
show
up
until
the
back
end
not
my
favorite
offering
from
the
good
people
at
left
hand
o
a
pretty
good
beer
rather
refreshing
sweetish
and
sodalike
low
abv
cant
say
id
drink
it
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
my
type
of
beer
poured
pale
golden
with
thin
head
that
didnt
last
i
found
a
light
honeyed
quality
on
the
nose
but
then
a
hint
of
those
hockey
pucks
in
the
mens
urinals
on
the
palate
the
ureic
element
was
there
as
the
ginger
just
wenttoo
far
and
evoked
a
urine
quality
too
much
ginger
light
otherwise
with
little
to
enjoy
if
you
dont
dig
the
ginger
whollop
o
was
expecting
a
much
more
intense
ginger
flavor
but
this
wasnt
overdone
reviewed
from
notes
had
ontap
at
a
bar
in
downtown
columbus
i
was
eager
to
try
this
as
i
am
a
fan
of
left
hands
stuff
and
wanted
to
try
before
buying
a
six
of
good
juju
appearance
upon
arrival
was
golden
in
color
with
very
little
head
that
left
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
of
ginger
is
distinct
and
im
wondering
if
this
will
be
ginger
overload
or
what
as
i
take
a
sip
everything
is
present
in
the
front
though
no
where
near
the
ginger
i
was
expecting
clean
yet
flat
finish
wow
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
underwhelming
mild
taste
of
ginger
and
a
quick
crisp
honey
like
taste
and
even
a
little
hop
before
a
rather
bland
drop
off
im
very
surprised
with
the
mildness
of
the
ginger
its
like
a
hint
of
ginger
more
smell
then
taste
even
this
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
not
bad
just
wanted
a
little
more
overall
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
truly
special
otherwise
overall
drinkability
almost
worth
trying
once
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
terribly
noteworthy
would
be
interesting
if
it
werent
so
watery
o
an
underwhelming
beer
in
almost
every
regard
small
on
aroma
small
on
flavor
small
on
substance
no
complexity
when
i
write
that
it
sounds
worse
than
it
actually
is
the
fact
is
that
there
is
just
nothing
to
recommend
this
beer
honestly
i
would
rather
drink
a
normal
good
ginger
ale
like
vernors
will
certainly
have
again
good
idea
for
a
ginger
ale
substitute
12oz
bottle
pours
a
translucent
golden
color
with
very
little
head
no
lacing
aromas
of
malt
and
spices
a
bit
earthy
and
floral
taste
is
very
thin
and
watery
there
is
some
ginger
flavor
to
it
along
with
some
malt
doesnt
pack
much
punch
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
guess
too
much
ginger
would
be
tough
to
take
bit
of
an
odd
aftertaste
as
well
slightly
metallic
i
guess
this
would
be
alright
in
the
summer
but
i
can
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
a
day
due
to
the
spice
flavor
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
im
even
happier
that
it
was
in
a
mix
12
pack
and
i
didnt
buy
it
on
its
own
not
really
worth
having
again
atmosphere
is
okay
no
real
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
light
as
is
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
what
a
shame
that
all
the
beer
was
enough
with
a
balanced
body
to
establish
itself
as
a
very
large
really
liked
the
revamped
artwork
on
the
bottle
for
this
one
it
caught
my
eye
enough
that
i
didnt
even
think
about
buying
it
i
just
knew
i
had
to
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
not
much
head
or
lacing
on
this
brew
at
all
the
smell
of
this
beer
has
a
healthy
amount
of
ginger
the
taste
of
the
ginger
was
pretty
intense
as
well
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
it
had
a
nice
sharp
and
crisp
feeling
to
it
pretty
refreshing
too
overall
i
am
reviewing
this
one
for
a
second
time
because
im
much
more
impressed
with
this
beer
now
than
i
was
before
in
general
good
juju
successfully
included
ginger
in
the
recipe
and
flavor
profile
without
creating
any
muddled
or
overbearing
qualities
positively
qualifying
it
the
identity
of
a
beer
brewed
with
ginger
and
while
i
feel
that
this
beer
does
the
world
of
ginger
a
great
favor
this
use
of
ginger
does
little
for
the
world
of
beer
right
now
it
just
stands
alone
and
its
not
working
out
it
also
would
do
it
wonders
to
make
this
a
creamier
offering
then
and
only
then
do
i
think
this
would
be
worth
a
try
this
is
a
total
miss
for
me
i
dont
mind
the
flavor
of
ginger
in
general
but
contained
in
a
beer
with
little
else
to
complement
the
flavor
it
just
doesnt
resonate
with
me
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
one
o
even
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
just
doesnt
make
the
cut
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
way
too
light
for
my
liking
the
juju
is
not
strong
enough
in
this
one
pours
a
deep
yellowgold
very
few
carb
trails
to
see
and
but
a
wisp
of
a
ring
hangs
around
smell
reminds
me
of
melons
mellow
and
also
slightly
sweet
taste
rolls
from
some
bitters
into
a
healthy
dose
of
ginger
and
then
back
to
a
nice
malty
backing
mildly
complex
finishes
tart
and
tight
a
decent
brew
interesting
for
sure
this
was
unique
but
just
average
on
the
taste
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
the
right
food
found
this
beer
at
the
beer
store
i
have
never
had
anything
from
left
hand
brewery
which
is
why
i
decided
to
try
good
juju
i
got
it
in
a
bottle
the
appearance
is
rather
traditionl
the
taste
is
surprsingly
good
i
havent
got
a
random
beer
taste
this
good
in
a
while
the
smell
is
sweet
with
ginger
tang
the
beer
is
smooth
going
down
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
has
sweet
taste
but
not
terribly
fruity
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
very
light
which
i
enjoyed
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
light
body
light
carbonation
reminded
me
of
a
radler
from
austria
except
with
ginger
instead
of
lemon
and
less
carbonation
overall
excellent
lawnmower
beer
something
good
to
just
have
around
in
summer
when
the
texas
heat
really
starts
getting
to
you
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
extremes
to
find
if
you
know
somewhere
that
carries
it
go
ahead
and
pick
up
a
six
pack
but
dont
sweat
it
if
you
cant
find
it
that
being
said
the
bottle
artwork
is
worth
the
purchase
price
one
of
my
favorite
beer
labels
bar
none
this
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
topped
with
a
tiny
head
theres
absolutely
huge
visible
carbonation
aroma
has
spicy
ginger
zesty
hops
and
some
bready
malts
the
taste
is
quite
good
the
ginger
is
huge
at
first
its
a
ginger
beer
though
what
else
would
i
really
expect
theres
some
nice
herbal
hops
to
back
it
up
along
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
very
carbonated
and
goes
down
easily
the
drinkability
is
rather
good
but
im
not
sure
how
a
session
with
these
would
go
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
ginger
fan
im
sure
a
huge
ginger
ale
fan
would
love
this
beer
the
beer
is
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
smells
of
nutty
caramel
malt
honey
and
barely
a
hint
of
ginger
the
taste
has
more
ginger
in
it
along
with
flavors
of
lemon
bread
and
a
spicy
aftertaste
it
seems
thin
and
watery
but
has
a
pleasant
dry
finish
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
anything
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
tasty
and
refreshing
definitely
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
easy
drinking
also
would
make
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
d
not
great
not
bad
i
like
ginger
so
i
am
hoping
that
there
might
be
a
better
one
out
there
o
im
a
big
ginger
ale
lover
and
this
would
make
a
great
sessionably
alcoholic
alternative
to
that
kudos
overall
i
would
defiantly
say
this
beer
is
worth
trying
once
another
winner
from
left
hand
id
like
a
little
bit
more
hops
just
to
give
it
a
bit
more
complexity
still
its
very
good
overall
disappointing
the
ginger
is
not
a
gimick
or
afterthought
it
is
well
integrated
into
the
taste
of
this
ale
perfect
for
summer
good
summer
quaff
nothing
experimental
or
highly
flavored
but
i
give
left
hand
credit
for
creating
a
lighter
beer
with
some
interesting
flavor
d
overall
i
liked
this
brew
was
expecting
the
ginger
to
overpower
the
brew
but
it
was
very
subtle
and
everything
was
blanced
nicely
would
get
this
again
taste
is
a
inbetween
mix
of
what
id
think
of
as
a
lighter
blonde
doppelbock
and
sprite
has
a
smooth
background
of
lightly
bready
buttery
citrus
tinted
maltyness
but
a
push
of
ginger
root
and
slightly
biting
carbonation
pull
away
from
the
center
a
bit
making
for
an
ok
experience
for
both
the
taste
and
the
body
which
is
light
medium
and
a
empty
watery
finish
with
all
that
it
does
offer
a
nice
summery
drinkability
and
ease
however
beyond
one
or
two
you
may
find
yourself
seeking
something
else
much
like
i
did
simply
a
basic
englishstyle
ale
the
ginger
touch
is
nice
but
id
like
to
see
it
more
intense
and
the
malt
maltier
o
if
you
hate
ginger
youll
hate
this
beer
if
you
like
it
then
knock
yourself
out
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
although
the
ginger
isnt
really
strong
enough
to
make
this
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
this
again
light
highly
carbonated
pale

with
a

the

taste
definitely
has
a
ginger
presence
along
with
a
breadiness
that
comes
out
more
on
the
finish
the
beer
does
seem
pretty
watery
however
the
ginger
isnt
all
the
powerful
nor
are
really
any
of
the
flavors
hops
are
nearly
nonexistent
in
this
beer
so
it
finishes
rather
thin
and
watery
that
said
what
is
there
is
pretty
nice
it
drinks
extremely
easily
and
is
a
good
quaffer
for
the
hot
months
i
cant
give
it
extremely
high
marks
but
decent
d
very
drinkable
the
ginger
addition
while
not
all
that
strong
is
an
interesting
addition
besides
that
the
flavors
are
pretty
solid
nothing
amazing
but
everything
seems
to
work
this
is
drinkable
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
a
good
summer
beer
with
a
nonhazardous
abv
makes
this
both
refreshing
and
tasty
maybe
a
gateway
to
convert
a
boring
beer
friend
ive
thought
about
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
good
juju
when
i
saw
it
but
rather
than
going
all
in
with
the
purchase
of
a
six
pack
i
instead
decided
to
pick
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mix
six
im
digging
the
label
but
theres
not
much
else
to
go
on
looks
like
it
was
bottled
on
330
so
this
beer
should
be
relatively
fresh
i
love
the
concept
of
this
as
a
ginger
ale
so
lets
see
if
the
beer
measures
up
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
very
sturdy
head
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
helps
support
the
frothy
head
smell
is
a
little
bit
muted
that
could
be
me
im
always
stuffed
up
especially
when
travelling
as
i
am
tonight
taste
has
that
ginger
zing
youre
looking
for
the
bottle
says
refreshing
and
thats
probably
accurate
my
palate
is
a
bit
beat
up
so
its
tough
for
me
to
pick
out
the
nuances
of
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
malt
sweetness
starts
things
off
giving
way
to
the
ginger
as
carbonation
scrubs
that
away
hop
character
comes
through
in
the
finish
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
type
of
style
it
fell
into
which
is
fine
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
classification
id
say
its
somewhere
in
the
pale
ale
category
mouthfeel
is
light
without
ever
being
watery
and
the
beer
finishes
somewhere
between
sweet
and
dry
the
ginger
helps
keep
things
light
and
leaves
you
wanting
to
drink
more
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
especially
on
a
warm
summer
night
pretty
good
overall
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
cant
say
i
like
its
style
or
any
of
the
attributes
with
taste
or
mouthfeel
i
will
give
left
hand
a
decent
grade
on
this
beer
but
doesnt
satisfy
my
buds
and
had
a
weak
aroma
altogether
i
would
suggest
many
other
left
hand
brews
before
this
one
this
may
be
their
only
drain
pour
beer
on
their
list
with
my
face
aflame
from
the
sun
of
dark
lord
day
yesterday
i
could
use
some
good
juju
right
now
the
namesake
beer
pours
a
clear
amberstraw
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
corn
very
light
mint
light
orange
peel
and
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
peel
nutmeg
ginger
coriander
flowers
and
grass
the
body
is
a
hefty
lightlight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
refreshing
finish
overall
a
decently
nice
brew
nothing
special
nor
anything
amazing
but
a
nice
thing
to
sit
and
drink
on
for
a
little
while
o
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
a
great
summer
brew
and
super
refreshing
i
wont
be
buying
it
all
the
timeand
its
not
my
favoritebut
i
enjoyed
it
in
full
a
nice
pale
amber
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
this
gingerspiced
brew
tingles
the
nose
with
its
pungent
ginger
zestiness
and
despite
gingers
natural
health
benefits
proven
to
help
with
nausea
and
digestive
ailments
ill
admit
that
ginger
beer
isnt
much
more
than
a
novelty
at
this
point
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
left
hands
brews
but
this
beer
has
me
torn
its
among
the
better
ginger
beers
ive
had
for
certain
and
its
a
nice
diversion
from
the
usual
fruit
or
spiceladen
ales
but
i
cant
say
its
one
id
pursue
either
overall
i
would
say
this
had
the
potential
to
be
good
but
instead
it
came
out
like
taking
a
lame
pilsner
and
soaking
ginger
rot
in
it
it
meets
its
name
but
is
not
a
repeat
beverage
for
me
certainly
an
interesting
beer
id
like
to
try
some
other
gingerbased
brews
and
see
how
they
compare
if
i
come
upon
this
again
ill
try
it
again
in
the
hopes
that
my
bottle
wasnt
good
d
not
a
terrible
or
undrinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
all
that
great
o
quite
interesting
i
enjoyed
it
as
it
was
very
refreshing
and
a
good
session
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
again
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
o
a
very
good
spiced
beer
in
my
opinion
this
genre
is
open
to
quite
a
bit
of
interpretation
i
am
a
fan
of
ginger
in
general
but
know
too
well
how
it
can
often
be
too
much
juju
pulls
off
ginger
in
beer
very
nicely
loved
the
ginger
flavor
but
not
one
of
the
best
spiced
ales
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
ginger
the
beer
spells
fantastic
its
fresh
and
easy
to
drink
i
had
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
very
little
head
poured
from
bottle
with
a
bottled
on

into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
rich
golden
color
with
very
little
head
that
disappeared
quickly
has
a
wonderful
ginger
smell
that
is
just
right
goes
down
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
the
ginger
sticks
around
just
long
enough
overall
a
good
beer
would
recommend
to
all
who
have
not
tried
before
o
refreshing
quaffable
brew
i
think
this
beer
could
be
so
much
more
but
as
is
its
just
an
ok
beer
o
seems
like
a
sodabeer
combo
in
some
ways
but
the
malt
sweetness
is
more
substantial
and
leaves
a
little
more
better
than
i
expected
by
a
pretty
solid
margin
as
it
was
poured
into
a
glass
you
could
see
the
murky
yellow
form
in
the
glass
it
gave
a
very
fruity
and
very
ginger
smell
to
the
beer
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
beer
that
over
powered
the
senses
this
beer
has
a
robust
flavor
without
over
powering
all
other
senses
it
is
like
tasting
a
very
strong
fruity
beer
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
it
is
a
great
desert
drink
cheers
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
for
some
reason
i
remember
a
couple
years
ago
left
hand
making
a
ginger
beer
that
was
a
little
more
flavorful
and
lighter
and
more
refreshing
ill
give
it
a
b
o
i
am
surprised
that
i
do
not
disdain
this
outright
i
rather
enjoy
it
picked
this
beer
out
because
of
the
design
on
the
bottle
glad
i
did
beer
poured
from
a
twelve
oz
bottle
golden
color
with
one
inch
foamy
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
with
some
ginger
but
not
overpowering
taste
is
impressive
toasted
malt
goes
well
with
ginger
overtones
but
the
spiciness
of
the
ginger
does
not
takeover
good
seasonal
beer
d
not
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
ju
ju
is
a
solid
session
beer
for
fans
of
ginger
or
pale
ale
drinkers
that
enjoy
the
less
hopped
versions
nothing
really
stood
out
as
amazing
on
this
beer
which
is
a
touch
upsetting
tastetoasted
malt
ginger
spiciness
wellbalanced
ginger
not
overdone
very
smooth
and
drinkable
esblike
in
character
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
at

0abv
overall
a
decent
session
beer
but
would
probably
be
more
enjoyable
on
a
warm
afternoon
than
a
chill
evening
pretty
much
ho
hum
nothing
really
stands
out
and
not
something
i
will
drink
a
lot
of
it
is
great
that
this
is
a
low
abv
session
beer
but
really
lacking
in
any
character
o
lets
just
say
i
am
glad
i
didnt
buy
the
full
sixer
of
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
drinking
just
very
lackluster
drinkable
brew
slight
grassy
bitterness
no
alcohol
present
ginger
quality
never
gets
old
i
start
to
feel
better
about
it
the
longer
i
stay
on
this
one
verdict
i
got
the
impression
that
most
of
the
qualities
of
this
beer
were
headed
for
somewhere
but
none
could
agree
on
a
place
to
land
if
they
were
going
for
light
leafy
tea
beer
with
ginger
they
should
have
had
a
more
agreeable
mouthfeel
or
vice
versa
for
a
thick
ruddy
creamy
feel
with
an
appropriate
taste
to
accompany
the
balance
of
stats
are
quite
off
this
is
a
one
time
drink
for
me
i
had
it
im
not
a
big
fan
i
wont
write
ginger
beers
out
of
my
repertoire
but
i
didnt
find
this

memorable

of

as
it
can
be

if
wielded

to
see
this

so
thanks
to

for
reminding
us
this
could

be

def
you
can
have
multiple
of
these

are
pretty

with
a
lot
of
mineral

quality
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light

a
fairly

making
it
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
good
one
to
try
in

d
surprised
me
thought
it
would
be
awful
but
not
bad
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
asian
bbq
meal
perhaps
a
different
hot

beer
worth
trying
once
likely
that
i
wont
buy
it
again
wasnt
bad
however
wasnt
great
might
be
good
when
i
have
a

during

when
im

love

signature
glass
pours
yellow
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
maintains
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cloves
cinnamon
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
cloves
and
pickled
ginger
it
has
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
for
the
style
very
smooth
flavor
and
good
aroma
the
pickled
ginger
flavor
makes
me
think
of
eating
sushi
a
good
pairing
i
have
no
idea
but
might
be
worth
a
shot
for
someone
tried
this
at
fifty
brews
in
orlando
and
wow
is
this
a
nice
surprise
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
classic
ginger
and
the
taste
is
a
clean
ale
with
a
hint
of
ginger
its
not
bland
in
any
respect
but
it
is
also
very
well
balanced
no
overpowering
sweetness
and
no
overpowering
ginger
this
beer
is
a
hit
and
has
become
one
of
our
favorite
tailgating
brews
its
a
shame
we
cant
get
it
year
round
as
i
would
seek
this
out
poured
into
tulip
glass
produces
a
1
finger
head
that
quickly
dissapates
into
nothingness
no
aroma
of
ginger
or
anything
discernable
for
that
matter
taste
is
a
pretty
bland
ale
no
spice
or
ginger
that
i
can
detect
must
be
so
faint
or
sublime
i
just
dont
register
it
weak
is
the
word
the
bottle
is
dated
best
before
122510
so
i
dont
think
its
a
freshness
issue
i
just
think
this
is
really
bland
nothingness
too
bad
was
hoping
for
some
peppery
zing
or
pop
juju
is
a
real
dud
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
much
just
taken
over
by
a
good
amount
of
ginger
the
taste
is
along
the
same
linesits
ginger
ginger
and
more
ginger
its
really
hard
to
describe
much
on
this
as
the
spicy
ginger
is
about
all
that
im
able
to
taste
maybe
a
touch
of
malt
in
the
background
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
toward
the
end
making
this
a
bit
hard
to
drink
all
that
much
of
cheers
this
beer
has
a
good
dark
brass
almost
bronze
color
it
has
excellent
head
and
lace
it
has
a
fruity
then
spicy
aroma
it
has
a
fruity
taste
first
that
is
followed
by
a
ginger
cookie
like
taste
there
are
a
lot
of
grain
tones
to
the
flavor
as
well
with
an
average
amount
of
hops
it
has
a
good
average
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
carbonation
bite
drink
wouldnt
have
another
this
is
one
that
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
cant
possibly
imagine
a
situation
where
im
going
to
say
man
you
know
what
would
hit
the
spot
right
now
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
a
very
little
dryness
with
lots
of
lingering
ginger
spices
in
general
go
with
it
a
very
light
bitterness
and
grassy
hop
taste
but
mostly
just
candied
ginger
again
d
with
a
bit
more
ginger
this
would
be
improved
but
it
still
an
easily
drinkable
beer
unfortunately
in
a
slightly
macro
sense
d
good
brew
for
a
hot
day
not
some
thing
that
i
would

to
have
in

d
better
than
a

lager
but
not
by
much
especially
with
the
mouthfeel
the
ginger
keeps
it
a
little
interesting
but
left
hand
should
have
done
more
with
this
would
make
a
good
starter
craft
at

o
interesting
beer
and
easily
approachable
could
use
more
malt
character
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
hops
gets
to
me
maybe
if
the
ginger
had
been
stronger
hold
your
nose
and
dive
in
and
once
the
taste
kicks
in
it
is
a
nicely
delivered
beer
however
i
feel
it
is
not
one
id
want
to
fill

with
one
is
enough

drinkability
hmmm
decent
beer
but
i
thought
it
woul
dhave
more
ginger
flavor
good
sushi
beer
though
d
so
drinkable
it
is
too
drinkable
i
agree
that
this
is
a
kind
of
girly
beer
light
in
taste
abv
and
mouthfeel
i
expected
a
lot
more
d
easily
drinkable
and
fairly
balanced
i
found
myself
tiring
of
ginger
as
i
neared
the
end
of
a
12oz
bottle
though
for
a
much
better
version
of
this
style
try
kiuchi
hitachino
nest
ginger
brew
ive
also
had
good
results
brewing
dark
malt
with
added
ginger
and
ale
yeast
i
e
dark
ginger
ale
not
in
your
face
ginger
which
i
kind
of
remember
it
being
a
couple
years
ago
as
it
is
now
its
a
slightly
more
interesting
version
of
a
standard
golden
ale
it
paired
nicely
with
a
fresh
mozzarella
flatbread
on
a
hot
afternoon
pours
slightly
golden
yellow
with
a
delicate
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
ginger
aroma
some
citrus
and
some
subtle
malt
sweetness
i
have
had
some
ginger
beers
before
but
as
far
as
ginger
aroma
this
one
has
them
all
beat
i
am
eager
to
take
a
sip
the
ginger
carries
over
into
the
taste
but
is
not
quite
as
dominate
sweet
yet
mild
malt
is
the
other
main
flavor
as
well
as
some
very
noble
tasting
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
beer
has
a
fairly
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
not
a
super
exciting
beer
but
if
you
like
ginger
it
is
a
good
one
to
try
i
bet
it
would
go
great
with
sushi
d
a
nice
lightly
flavored
session
beer
that
is
a
bit
off
the
beaten
path
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
ginger
taste
is
light
caramel
sweetness
up
front
with
a
citrusy
and
ginger
flavor
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
the
low
alcohol
is
a
plus
quite
full
bodied
for
a
true
session
beer
i
would
get
this
again
d
low
abv
but
just
not
very
good
tasting
sadly
the
worst
left
hand
brew
ive
had
a
refreshing
frivolity
quote
on
the
bottle
is
an
excellent
summation
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
mild
zestiness
i
will
not
revisit
this
one
but
i
could
see
where
some
might
enjoy
this
refreshing
session
type
beer
impression
i
like
spice
beers
better
better
in
their
winter
warmer
presentations
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
tasty
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
produced
a
quarter
inch
head
the
brew
is
a
light
golden
color
smells
like
fresh
ginger
root
and
faint
malt
the
taste
to
me
is
all
ginger
i
percieve
very
little
else
in
the
way
of
normal
beer
flavors
that
having
been
said
i
love
the
taste
of
ginger
and
this
is
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
beverage
very
little
aftertaste
save
for
the
lingering
ginger
flavor
i
had
it
with
pork
chops
roasted
in
a
honeymustard
glaze
great
pairing
orange
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fsding
headkind
of
looks
like
an
iced
tea
aroma
is
ginger
taste
is
gingertea
leaves
and
a
hint
of
lemon
overall
a
decent
beer
that
not
only
looks
like
an
iced
tea
but
also
tastes
like
one
i
think
it
should
be
tried
at
least
once
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
if
even
an
entire
one
it
truly
tasted
like
drinking
tea
so
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
only
be
desirable
in
special
circumstances
not
overly
refreshing
due
to
the
dryness
juju
delivers
on
what
it
promises
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
folks
who
like
ginger
it
makes
for
a
light
and
refreshing
summertime
quaff
if
you
like
true
ginger
ale
this
brew
should
satisfy
your
thirst
overall
this
beer
had
potential
but
the
ginger
just
isnt
strong
enough
whats
left
is
a
marginal
macro
brew
deasy
drinking
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
it
tastes
like
they
brewed
a
craft
version
of
a
light
beer
and
then
threw
a
little
ginger
in
just
for
kicks
could
use
more
crisp
aggressive
flavor
for
my
taste
malt
hops
and
spice
seem
muddled
together
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
pretty
good
refreshing
summer
beer
but
id
have
my
reservations
about
having
more
than
2
or
3
based
on
the
ginger
wearing
out
the
palate
good
stuff
easily
quaffable
but
moderately
sessionable
notes
decent
mouthfeel
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
maybe
too
different
overall
not
very
good
in
my
opinion
the
ginger
is
interesting
but
there
are
too
many
offnotes
the
beer
pours
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
ginger
it
smells
about
like
a
batch
of
ginger
snap
cookies
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
this
is
liquid
ginger
snaps
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
sure
how
often
i
would
drink
this
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
least
once
since
it
is
definitely
different
pours
a
light
gold
with
nice
white
head
that
rudely
disappears
without
saying
goodbye
the
aroma
is
incredible
though
with
killer
ginger
up
front
and
mild
floral
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
nothing
to
shout
from
the
rooftops
but
is
exactly
what
this
thai
chili
stirfry
needed
to
battle
the
burn
in
my
chest
refreshing
and
zesty
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
carbonation
is
fizzy
feeldrink
thin
mouth
i
can
only
drink
one
of
these
guys
i
really
dont
care
for
the
taste
drinkable
enough
and
a
nice
thirstquencher
i
cant
see
seeking
it
out
though
drinkability
is
fine
refreshing
you
have
to
like
ginger
though
to
be
able
to
enjoy
it
d
just
okay
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
just
didnt
quite
come
together
d
i
dont
really
know
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
it
isnt
offensive
by
any
means
and
the
ginger
flavors
are
fairly
enjoyable
i
just
couldnt
help
feeling
like
i
was
drinking
a
bmc
with
ginger
added
as
the
base
beer
just
isnt
that
impressive
an
interesting
brew
but
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
anytime
soon
d
its
impossible
to
take
anymore
but
small
sips
of
this
so
drinkability
suffers
not
a
chugging
or
gulping
beer
i
enjoy
the
taste
its
not
horrible
but
its
overpowering
i
would
not
mind
having
this
around
while
im
eating
some
sushi
for
small
sips
in
between
along
with
another
beverage
of
course
too
much
ginger
one
sided
taste
uh
you
know
i
dont
like
ginger
with
my
sushi
and
i
guess
its
something
psychosomatic
but
the
beer
tastes
like
fish
and
rice
mouthfeel
of
that
and
drinkability
must
suffer
like
a
cubs
fan
sorry
for
the
neg
post
but
it
was
that
bad
for
me
not
my
standard
review
d
i
will
say
that
i
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
however
there
isnt
enough
here
to
keep
me
interested
for
more
than
a
pint
d
very
unique
flavor
light
in
body
and
very
clean
in
the
finish
more
of
a
summer
beer
imo
a
very
easy
drinker
medium
bodied
and
moderately
firm
clean
and
quite
drinkable
surprising
given
the
amount
of
spiciness
kind
of
a
onetrick
pony
but
would
make
a
good
food
beer
try
it
with
sushi
d
ive
had
their
stuff
on
tap
but
this
is
my
first
left
hand
review
not
too
great
the
flavor
just
doesnt
come
across
well
even
if
it
is
unique
i
dont
know
that
it
could
be
a
sevenyearold
bottle
i
dont
think
its
bad
in
that
way
just
not
a
delightful
brew
for
me
ill
never
pick
it
up
again
stranger
even
that
i
actually
love
ginger
ale
soda
overall
this
beer
is
weird
i
think
i
like
it
but
im
not
sure
it
would
probably
go
really
good
with
some
sweet
and
mild
curry
i
will
probably
buy
another
single
in
the
future
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
6pack
of
this
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
enough
in
body
and
alcohol
to
be
drunk
in
quantity
but
complex
enough
in
flavor
to
stay
interesting
through
a
session
from
a
drinkability
standpoint
this
beer
is
a
great
success
d
tastes
like
a
miller
high
life
without
the
amazing
head
and
fresh
ginger
added
not
bad
by
any
means
and
the
fresh
ginger
taste
instead
of
a
sweet
candy
like
substitute
is
quite
nice
and
a
pleasant
surprise
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
soon
d
while
i
do
find
this
to
be
a
tasty
beer
i
do
not
think
i
could
session
this
beer
i
love
ginger
and
i
love
beer
so
this
hits
the
spot
when
i
crave
both
but
i
couldnt
make
a
night
of
it
wow
this
beer
is
kind
of
crazy
the
finish
is
definitely
fres
cut
ginger
appears
a
slightly
clouded
golden
apricot
tone
with
a
large
billowing
white
head
with
a
creamy
texture
when
i
popped
the
cap
it
started
oozing
out
and
i
spilled
a
bit
while
trying
to
pour
it
aroma
is
spicy
with
some
mild
citrus
notes
nice
bready
biscuit
malt
character
flavor
wise
that
finish
is
hardcore
with
the
ginger
tone
im
guessing
mild
hops
that
are
pretty
much
impossible
to
recognize
with
the
ginger
overpowering
a
bit
one
sided
on
the
ginger
ample
sweetness
but
sort
of
an
astringent
quality
arises
especially
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
spritzy
but
not
over
the
top
drinkability
overall
this
one
is
a
strange
bird
worth
the
experience
probably
goes
well
with
some
asian
cooking
maybe
some
thai
food
or
some
jerk
chicken
since
the
label
is
all
about
the
jamaica
saying
something
about
this
ale
is
irie
taste
like
a
ginger
ale
ginger
is
in
the
smell
and
unmistakable
in
the
taste
not
much
else
to
look
forward
to
a
bit
lagery
hops
not
very
noticeable
beer
is
spicy
brewed
in
longmont
co
thats
the
only
reason
i
got
it
wouldnt
look
forward
to
this
again
if
somebody
put
it
on
the
table
for
me
to
drink
md
a
bit
spicy
and
monotonous
but
tasty
as
mentioned
medium
bodied
may
be
overspiced
for
some
moderately
drinkable
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
for
me
id
love
for
southern
tier
or
dogfish
to
try
something
with
gingerthat
would
be
interesting
nice
mild
ale
with
a
great
taste
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
still
prefer
the
soft
drink
version
from
the
mountain
mixer
sample
12
pack
drinkability
id
love
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
wouldve
liked
to
see
a
more
robust
version
of
this
more
ginger
more
hops
more
abv
as
is
a
worthwhile
experiment
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
glad
i
didnt
get
a
six
pack
will
not
drink
this
ever
again
would
not
buy
this
again
ginger
is
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
ginger
taste
which
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
with
this
name
further
there
is
a
decent
bitterness
a
slight
sweetness
as
well
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
normally
but
this
one
is
really
nice
recommended
the
carbonation
was
thin
as
was
the
mouthfeel
still
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
for
its
lack
of
flavor
other
than
that
of
ginger
id
have
given
it
higher
marks
d
this
is
a
hard
beer
for
me
to
judge
the
flavor
is
nice
and
certainly
different
the
light
body
and
low
abv
make
it
go
down
quick
would
i
want
another
one
not
really
for
me
this
is
a
beer
im
glad
i
tried
but
not
something
id
seek
out
d
easy
drinking
beer
i
like
the
flavor
of
ginger
in
a
beer
and
this
doesnt
let
me
down
i
might
have
to
try
this
again
would
like
to
try
on
tap
or
very
fresh
evening
at
the
dinner
table
drink
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
light
good
crisp
beer
fairly
refreshing
too
drinkability
this
is
an
aquired
taste
beer
i
will
get
it
again
but
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
think
it
tastes
like
a
mix
between
an
amber
ale
and
an
iced
tea
i
good
beer
but
not
one
i
could
drink
a
six
of
the
flavor
was
a
pleasant
surprise
in
this
one
as
sometimes
ginger
beers
can
be
a
bit
acerbic
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
done
very
well
though
recommended
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
light
but
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
the
beer
gripped
onto
me
use
this
against
the
lighter
bad
juju
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
breadyness
at
the
end
makes
it
better
goes
down
well
and
i
can
see
this
being
a
refreshing
spring
beer
therefore
it
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
would
recommend
this
not
groundbreaking
but
definitely
worth
trying
i
could
go
for
it
again
overall
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
good
though
notesa
beer
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
more
mdvery
light
bodied
which
i
didnt
really
care
for
i
think
if
this
beer
had
a
bigger
malt
profile
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
overall
not
bad
though
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
this
is
a
straightforward
no
frills
ginger
beer
i
find
it
to
be
quite
well
done
though
and
is
flavorful
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
but
not
overdoing
it
on
the
spices
a
smattering
of
hoppy
dryness
creeps
in
near
the
end
and
increases
the
refreshing
factor
of
this
brew
this
would
make
a
fantastic
summertime
evening
quencher
and
at
4
is
a
sessioner
im
having
no
problems
finishing
my
bomber
by
myself
good
beer
drinkability
a
bit
light
on
the
ginger
but
im
down
with
that
i
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
the
ginger
was
pretty
punchy
i
e
obnoxious
this
time
its
pretty
damned
mild
however
if
given
the
choice
of
too
much
ginger
or
not
enough
ill
pick
the
latter
every
single
time
m
watery
and
disappointing
i
was
actually
pretty
surprised
with
this
offering
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
decided
to
give
it
a
go
thinking
it
probably
wouldnt
be
that
great
i
mean
come
on
ginger
but
it
actually
didnt
have
that
strong
as
in
off
putting
ginger
taste
i
expected
to
get
the
flavor
was
pretty
nice
good
smell
to
it
and
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
sure
not
something
i
would
ever
get
on
a
regular
basis
but
for
sure
this
was
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
meets
like
a
reeds
ginger
beer
very
refreshing
if
you
like
ginger
like
i
do
i
could
have
a
few
but
the
beer
is
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
not
nearly
as
frightening
as
i
was
expecting
not
bad
at
all
i
was
intrigued
by
the
use
of
ginger
in
a
beer
and
its
use
was
definitely
intersting
the
strength
of
the
ginger
was
strong
in
the
aroma
and
it
made
itself
even
more
pronounced
once
it
hit
my
tongue
the
lightness
of
the
beer
allowed
the
ginger
to
stay
strong
well
into
the
finish
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
a
nice
crisp
summer
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
ale
with
little
to
no
palate
fatigue
and
a
nice
hint
of
ginger
drinkability
good
session
beer
im
not
into
the
bland
flavor
the
ginger
is
nice
maybe
it
is
better
with
food
md
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
taste
is
pretty
good
and
drinkability
is
very
good
the
taste
is
up
to
the
drinker
the
ginger
is
a
nice
taste
and
something
different
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
helps
it
along
id
try
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeyamber
hue
with
an
average
white
foamy
head
some
lacing
is
noticeable
throughout
aroma
is
big
time
ginger
with
a
backbone
of
pale
malt
and
some
fruity
aromas
in
the
back
ground
flavor
has
some
malt
sweetness
and
toasted
notes
from
the
pale
ale
the
ginger
and
the
hops
then
create
a
semicitrus
fruit
hit
that
is
an
interesting
taste
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
then
spicy
it
is
very
likened
to
a
soda
or
ginger
ale
in
that
it
is
extremely
high
in
carbonation
it
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
simply
not
one
for
my
palate
this
beer
might
be
low
in
alcohol
but
not
in
taste
it
has
a
wonderful
summer
drinking
feel
about
it
it
might
be
a
little
expensive
and
as
far
as
i
can
find
only
in
4
packs
but
it
is
very
good
especially
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
ginger
and
on
a
special
note
this
beer
should
be
the
required
drink
with
sushi
like
red
wine
is
with
steak
and
such
its
a
nice
feel
watery
but
a
tad
fizzy
its
a
very
earthy
drink
interesting
but
not
the
greatest
thing
ever
nice
enough
though
pours
up
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
lots
of
ginger
somewhat
of
a
hop
balance
smell
the
taste
is
very
mellowed
out
ginger
probably
due
to
the
aging
sweet
light
malts
nice
hop
balance
medium
body
low
smoothe
carbo
not
too
shabby
for
a
ginger
beer
if
bought
out
of
sample
pack
the
ginger
seems
not
as
strong
so
while
its
a
decent
ginger
beer
and
something
different
its
nothing
amazing
or
terribly
complex
still
worth
a
try
if
you
like
ginger
or
spice
beers
pours
a
deep
golden
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
thin
white
headwith
good
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
ginger
and
other
spicesand
some
nice
floral
hops
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
all
there
nice
mix
of
sipces
and
sweet
fruits
very
enjoyable
d
one
or
two
would
be
my
limit
on
this
while
crisp
and
dry
it
is
hardly
an
all
day
drinker
flavorwise
the
drinkability
of
this
increases
as
the
serving
gets
colder
and
the
outside
temperature
gets
warmer
decent
but
does
not
warrant
a
six
pack
purchase
even
for
the
curious
pours
a
pale
orange
into
a
pint
glass
theres
a
onefinger
off
white
head
that
settles
down
with
a
slight
lacing
all
around
the
glass
smells
of
malts
ginger
spice
and
a
little
hop
aroma
in
the
background
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
there
tastes
of
smooth
not
overly
bitter
hops
with
a
malt
background
theres
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
subtle
fruitiness
which
is
almost
hidden
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
is
fairly
active
figured
there
would
be
a
little
more
taste
to
this
one
but
theres
just
not
enough
going
on
here
to
get
your
taste
buds
going
this
was
an
interesting
brew
but
i
find
this
category
hard
to
score
appearance
is
a
bit
bland
no
head
or
lacing
and
orangeyellow
color
smell
is
good
a
nice
whiff
of
ginger
comes
through
and
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
similar
to
smell
but
pretty
weak
almost
watered
down
mouthfeel
is
expectadly
light
as
well
but
there
is
some
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
largely
because
it
is
so
light
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
d
low
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
much
ginger
make
this
beer
a
onetime
sipper
d
i
was
locked
on
with
the
aroma
but
was
pretty
disappointed
with
the
rest
the
wet
dog
thing
kinda
fries
me
too
md
pretty
refreshing
effervescent
and
light
bodied
the
taste
is
apparently
much
better
than
the
cloying
nose
makes
me
believe
the
dryish
palate
overall
gives
the
whole
beer
a
substantial
lift
not
bad
overall
but
it
could
surely
use
a
bit
more
hoppyness
and
bitterness
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
d
an
interesting
beer
i
might
pair
one
with
some
gingery
asian
meals
but
this
isnt
a
particularly
good
beer
i
am
impressed
that
they
were
able
to
keep
it
fairly
balanced
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
distinctly
of
ginger
with
lemon
yeast
and
slightly
earthy
malt
it
tasted
like
strong
ginger
with
bitter
floral
hops
and
almost
no
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
ginger
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
neat
idea
for
a
beer
but
it
lacked
subtlety
the
overpowering
ginger
flavor
made
it
a
bit
tedious
to
finish
notes
strange
combo
came
across
this
beer
at
a
beer
fest
not
too
sure
i
am
in
to
the
herbal
beers
have
had
worse
see
any
organic
the
low
abv
good
taste
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
refreshing
beer
extremely
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
im
a
big
fan
of
sodas
made
with
real
ginger
so
this
was
a
real
treat
its
light
and
enjoyable
a
good
summertime
treat
also
a
good
one
to
bring
to
a
party
for
people
to
sample
something
a
little
bit
different
i
dont
know
if
its
something
ill
buy
more
than
once
a
month
but
i
will
be
buying
again
d
average
marks
here
needs
a
nice
sushi
meal
to
go
along
with
it
and
than
it
would
be
ez
going
down
left
hand
brewing
company
juju
ginger
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
short
initial
froathy
head
the
smell
is
mild
and
pleasant
of
ginger
ginger
definitely
comes
out
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
medium
to
high
carbonation
overall
the
drinkability
is
ok
it
doesnt
blast
you
with
with
much
of
anything
but
it
is
unique
and
a
nice
pleasant
change
of
taste
if
this
brew
had
a
little
more
ginger
flavor
and
a
little
less
carbonation
it
would
be
a
great
change
of
taste
d
a
very
nice
summer
drinking
beer
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
relax
and
cool
off
with
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
this
is
a
very
refreshing
i
dont
know
why
these
are
sold
as
a
four
pack
since
this
is
very
sessionable
drinkability
a
pleasant
if
undemanding
and
bland
beer
nothing
memorable
worth
checking
out
but
not
worth
making
it
an
habit
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
light
and
refreshing
a
pleasant
and
pleasing
beer
all
around
this
comes
down
to
a
twist
of
ginger
over
a
fairly
bland
ale
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
pedestrian
blonde
ale
made
in
brewpubs
for
the
less
venturesome
with
a
touch
of
ginger
in
the
nose
and
the
finish
i
got
two
fingers
worth
of
foamy
bubbly
offwhite
head
from
my
pour
the
color
was
a
hazy
medium
amber
the
nose
was
rich
with
a
ginger
snap
and
my
mouth
began
to
water
as
a
result
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
decent
if
not
as
strong
as
desired
ginger
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
slightly
unpleasant
astringency
however
i
have
had
better
ginger
beers
although
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
name
one
at
this
very
moment
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
probably
would
not
return
to
it
i
enjoy
left
hand
brewerys
beers
but
it
was
hard
to
stomach
this
one
it
poured
a
honey
orange
color
with
a
good
head
smelled
of
ginger
and
citrus
the
taste
is
what
got
me
i
sure
many
people
like
it
but
ginger
is
just
not
my
thing
especially
in
beer
had
to
pour
this
one
out
sorry
left
hand
overall
this
is
a
somewhat
disappointing
beer
ive
had
nonalcoholic
ginger
sodassweet
ginger
beers
that
had
a
ton
of
spritz
and
ginger
snap
bite
this
doesnt
have
any
of
that
by
comparison
i
was
hoping
for
more
spice
acid
kick
but
it
never
delivered
perhaps
the
fact
its
almost
a
year
old
affected
itdunno
when
i
bought
this
honestly
just
decided
to
drink
it
as
it
was
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
if
offered
again
perhaps
i
take
another
taste
of
it
but
im
not
seeking
this
one
out
and
can
only
drink
this
with
food
d
this
is
drinkable
however
i
dont
think
i
could
have
too
many
of
them
at
once
taste
is
mainly
ginger
the
yeast
appears
a
bit
belgian
fruity
with
some
solvent
components
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
which
has
some
saisonlike
characteristics
these
ginger
and
somewhat
corky
tastes
are
very
pleasant
and
maybe
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
meaning
that
the
ginger
gives
a
tiny
bit
of
astringency
great
beer
though
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
try
and
i
imagine
it
would
pair
well
with
asian
food
the
ginger
again
is
nicely
balanced
but
unfortunately
the
nature
of
ginger
drastically
reduces
the
drinkability
how
many
people
want
to
slug
down
several
pints
of
ginger
juice
d
its
also
a
session
beer
since
im
not
sick
of
the
ginger
at
all
d
again
better
and
more
drinkable
than
i
thought
it
would
be
very
good
for
a
novelty
beer
carbonation
is
strong
and
pleasant
the
beer
is
too
dry
i
feel
and
could
benefit
from
more
tackiness
id
see
drinking
this
from
time
to
time
as
a
novelty
but
i
think
the
product
could
use
some
improvement
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
full
flavor
doesnt
make
it
well
suited
to
chugging
or
anything
but
im
suprised
how
much
i
enjoy
this
in
spite
of
the
low
abv
probably
would
be
great
sitting
on
the
beach
probably
influenced
by
the
rasta
label
which
maybe
they
used
bc
it
would
probably
cut
cottonmouth
nicely
a
clean
pale
amber
beer
has
a
good
bubbly
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
has
a
good
ginger
snap
to
it
slightly
sweet
but
as
much
as
a
ginger
ale
sody
pop
its
hard
to
place
where
the
ginger
notes
the
hop
notes
and
the
malt
all
start
and
end
there
is
a
snap
of
ginger
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
bite
of
hops
along
the
edges
and
a
nice
light
malt
down
the
middle
i
think
drinking
this
on
draft
at
an
outside
cafe
on
a
warm
summer
day
would
be
ideal
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
ginger
can
be
offensive
when
used
in
extremes
think
of
those
little
pink
slivers
they
give
you
with
sushi
but
this
beer
doesnt
over
do
it
a
unique
refreshing
break
from
your
typical
juju
delivers
a
fairly
light
ginger
spiced
pale
ale
orangegold
in
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
sweet
ginger
in
the
nose
with
some
spicy
hops
and
light
citric
oranges
much
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
a
light
body
and
light
carbonation
not
bad
in
the
least
but
not
really
my
thing
either
one
is
probably
enough
for
me
12
ounce
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldorange
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
aroma
is
mainly
ginger
with
some
orange
apple
and
hops
noticable
too
taste
is
also
mostly
ginger
but
i
can
also
taste
some
lemon
grains
and
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
easy
to
drink
but
with
the
ginger
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
23
of
these
at
a
time
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
drinkable
brew
id
probably
enjoy
this
more
on
a
hot
day
but
its
still
good
on
a
cold
day
as
well
d
probably
the
best
ginger
spiced
ale
ive
had
not
something
id
drink
often
but
i
also
wouldnt
turn
one
down
all
over
the
board
on
this
one
i
like
the
appearance
nice
head
that
actually
retains
well
on
top
of
a
yellow
unattractive
beer
aroma
is
not
real
present
as
it
has
a
sweet
ginger
nose
taste
is
lost
ginger
comes
through
but
i
dont
like
the
profile
of
spices
with
the
ginger
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
chewy
pretty
good
considering
the
appearance
of
this
beer
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
as
it
came
in
a
mixed
pack
and
i
used
the
second
one
for
cooking
better
for
that
date
on
bottle
is
smeared
but
appears
to
be
81007
purchased
112207
today
is
011608
it
may
be
just
a
tad
on
the
flat
side
i
dunno
maybe
not
served
from
a
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
white
head
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
ginger
the
taste
is
like
no
beer
ive
ever
tried
powerful
ginger
flavor
little
bit
like
a
cross
between
a
cough
drop
and
a
chinese
stir
fry
little
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
fairly
thin
once
you
get
past
the
ginger
probably
a
better
summer
beer
than
one
for
a
cold
january
but
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
beer
styles
marvelous
aroma
but
it
cant
keep
that
promise
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
care
for
another
now
maybe
next
month
since
i
have
two
more
of
these
its
lightbodied
and
displays
some
decent
complexity
it
possesses
ample
carbonation
and
is
bright
and
lively
on
the
tongue
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
its
very
solid
for
the
style
d
it
is
drinkable
but
its
flavors
are
all
over
the
board
try
it
if
you
like
to
try
off
the
wall
brews
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
w
this
beer
but
i
actually
like
it
definatly
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
a
beer
that
tasted
anything
like
this
actually
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
a
beer
at
all
an
interesting
change
of
pace
its
best
paired
with
a
food
as
it
was
seemingly
brewed
for
that
purpose
its
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
if
you
like
ginger
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
yellow
color
with
a
sticky
white
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
you
can
definitely
pick
up
some
ginger
in
the
nose
along
with
some
slightly
buttery
malt
the
taste
is
malt
up
front
with
the
ginger
lingering
in
the
finish
with
a
dry
and
slightly
spicy
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
brew
that
is
not
overly
exiting
however
despite
its
simplicity
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
not
something
i
would
like
to
drink
ever
night
but
it
is
something
different
that
gets
extra
points
in
my
book
recommended
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
i
think
that
it
would
go
great
with
a
salad
pacific
rim
dishessushi
and
of
course
island
cuisine
drinkability
not
knowing
what
to
expect
when
i
threw
this
in
the
mixed
6
i
would
say
it
is
ok
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
though
an
interesting
beer
but
not
a
repurchase
drinkability
a
fun
idea
and
more
drinkable
perhaps
than
sas
attempt
at
a
ginger
beer
but
not
something
worth
buying
again
drinkability
a
touch
to
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
the
ginger
is
quite
refreshing
very
light
beer
that
is
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
beer
highly
recommend
you
avoid
this
one
which
is
disappointing
given
the
normally
excellent
left
hand
selections
i
have
to
admit
that
ginger
is
one
of
the
few
flavours
that
ive
not
fond
of
in
food
or
beverages
subtle
ginger
flavours
backed
up
by
garlic
or
a
strongly
flavoured
main
ingredient
are
fine
but
if
the
dominant
flavour
is
of
ginger
im
generally
put
off
thus
this
beer
seriously
doesnt
do
it
for
me
tthe
myriad
of
various
strong
ginger
flavours
put
me
off
therefore
i
didnt
enjoy
this
if
you
are
a
ginger
fan
especially
a
fan
of
nonalcoholic
ginger
ale
then
youll
probably
go
for
this
but
not
me
d
this
beer
is
light
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
a
strong
ginger
character
but
i
cant
say
i
really
enjoy
it
the
problem
for
me
here
is
the
type
of
ginger
character
the
aroma
it
good
but
the
flavor
is
too
medicinal
and
lacks
depth
there
is
none
of
the
spicy
flavorfull
ginger
that
i
have
occasionally
experianced
in
some
other
beers
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
ginger
and
hops
would
really
help
here
obviously
there
is
ginger
present
here
but
it
isnt
nearly
as
powerfu
as
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
which
was
a
pleasant
discovery
too
many
beers
in
this
category
are
overdone
with
incredibly
assertive
smells
of
what
the
beer
is
supposed
to
smell
like
this
was
mild
i
like
taste
is
very
pale
ale
like
with
the
ginger
showing
up
briefly
and
gently
on
the
finish
quite
drinkable
nice
da
ginger
is
really
good
for
you
mon
rastafari
i
have
to
say
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
abv
the
first
time
i
had
a
ginger
beer
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
but
it
had
quite
a
bite
and
really
surprised
me
it
was
a
homebrew
and
a
bit
over
gingered
that
experience
made
me
a
fan
of
gingers
and
this
is
a
solid
refreshing
example
of
the
style
im
glad
i
can
get
a
constant
supply
of
this
over
the
summer
an
interesting
summer
offering
too
heavy
in
citric
hops
and
overcarbonated
but
i
enjoy
the
asian
spices
for
the
novelty
pleasant
and
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
intresting
beer
here
had
a
ginger
beer
in
the
past
and
it
always
came
off
very
hot
to
me
this
was
a
fine
exception
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
signigicant
white
top
head
that
receded
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
sticky
white
lace
smell
was
very
difficult
to
place
lots
of
spice
with
a
light
earthy
smell
taste
was
very
light
and
refreshing
again
lots
of
spice
to
it
but
nothing
overwhelming
very
light
feel
grat
carbonation
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
this
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
actually
like
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
not
bad
at
all
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
pleasant
suprise
one
of
a
few
herbalspiced
beers
ive
had
not
unlike
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
when
it
comes
to
really
getting
big
flavor
out
of
the
chosen
ingredient
with
a
smooth
and
full
body
once
in
a
while
beer
that
has
whet
my
appetite
for
more
ginger
ales
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
and
sure
there
is
a
bit
of
that
but
it
was
a
nice
surprise
and
a
beer
which
id
get
again
certainly
worth
checking
out
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
but
the
ginger
flavor
does
give
it
an
interesting
twist
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
before
i
started
looking
for
something
else
overall
not
bad
at
all
unique
yet
mild
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
holds
well
and
nice
lacing
to
the
finish
aromas
of
ginger
fruit
and
hint
of
spice
malty
ginger
taste
with
slightly
sweet
tropical
fruit
flavors
mouthfeel
light
and
refreshing
carbonation
is
good
nice
beer
very
refreshing
change
of
pace
drink
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
seafood
or
clams
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
nice
persistent
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
floral
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
the
ginger
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
finishes
dry
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
would
think
one
would
be
plenty
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
for
a
spiced
beer
but
this
is
what
left
hand
brewery
is
good
at
this
beer
is
very
light
in
color
but
not
as
light
as
a
true
ginger
beer
it
is
somewhere
between
a
straw
and
light
amber
color
there
are
visible
bubbles
coming
off
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
great
and
full
of
ginger
the
ginger
is
more
subdued
in
the
taste
i
was
kind
of
thinking
this
would
be
a
ginger
beer
with
a
powerful
ginger
blast
but
the
ginger
is
in
more
of
a
background
role
as
it
was
most
likely
intended
for
a
lighter
colored
beer
it
does
have
a
pretty
good
body
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
of
the
ginger
flavor
but
i
would
drink
it
often
if
i
could
get
it
recommended
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
drinkability
a
great
beer
every
now
and
again
a
great
beer
to
order
at
the
local
sushi
bar
overall
this
one
is
pretty
decent
if
you
dont
like
ginger
it
obviously
wont
be
your
thing
but
if
you
do
like
it
dont
shy
away
thinking
it
will
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
because
it
wont
simple
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
soso
the
first
few
sips
were
refreshing
but
it
grew
tiring
as
the
glass
was
emptying
interesting
for
a
rare
occasion
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
spiced
beer
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
trying
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
to
find
this
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
would
be
perfect
to
session
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
excellently
carbonated
and
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
this
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
big
points
for
originality
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
with
sushi
or
stirfry
but
the
spicey
ginger
would
be
a
bit
much
to
session
on
its
own
the
first
few
sips
were
interesting
and
nice
but
after
that
i
found
it
unappealing
i
love
ginger
i
love
beer
i
love
ginger
ale
but
this
didnt
totally
do
it
for
me
its
quite
sessionable
though
at
4
abv
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
unique
flavor
could
get
overwhelming
after
a
few
pours
a
peachy
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
you
guessed
it
ginger
with
mangos
and
other
tropical
fruits
taste
is
of
bitter
ginger
with
a
strong
malt
flavor
pretty
full
bodied
flavor
on
my
palate
this
beer
was
really
hard
for
me
to
finish
once
it
warmed
up
the
ginger
flavor
really
was
very
strong
towards
the
end
and
kind
of
made
me
sick
of
it
d
this
beer
is
unbalanced
and
overall
unimpressive
but
interesting
nonetheless
unfortunately
this
combination
of
traits
is
not
good
for
drinkability
and
i
would
not
pursure
this
beer
again
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
has
some
caramel
and
toasted
bread
notes
along
with
ginger
fruity
esters
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
has
notes
of
caramel
biscuit
ginger
cane
sugar
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
really
light
and
crisp
and
drinkability
is
very
good
an
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
not
really
complex
though
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
fades
leaving
no
lace
cloudy
amber
color
very
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
nose
has
some
hops
and
maybe
a
hint
of
ginger
starts
with
hints
of
ginger
but
more
hops
and
malt
than
ginger
boring
clean
finish
2
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
drinks
very
easy
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
or
just
one
to
knock
back
on
a
warm
day
if
you
dont
like
ginger
you
make
see
it
differently
drinkability
id
like
to
try
this
with
sushi
as
i
think
itd
be
a
good
accompaniment
with
the
taste
and
the
lingering
dryness
otherwise
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
overall
m
d
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
with
a
big
carbonation
blast
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
to
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkable
yes
especially
if
you
have
a
stomach
ache
tasty
would
go
well
with
sushi
or
as
an
after
dinner
desert
to
cleanse
your
palate
good
change
of
pace
offering
from
left
hand
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
this
one
single
i
snagged
at
the
wine
house
aftertaste
lingers
interesting
a
lightly
flavored
ale
with
a
light
body
and
light
malt
sweetness
and
character
very
tealike
herbal
earthy
flavors
that
take
on
soft
spicy
flavors
of
course
loaded
with
ginger
that
is
evident
in
the
aromas
and
flavor
hops
combined
with
ginger
begin
to
take
on
raw
oak
characteristics
light
soft
clean
finish
with
a
light
ginger
oily
tingle
on
the
toung
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
ginger
does
seem
to
work
well
with
beer
this
is
my
second
example
i
have
tried
and
both
have
been
pleasant
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
ginger
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
and
weak
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
a
little
watery
and
finishes
dry
with
some
ginger
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
it
needs
more
body
it
comes
across
a
little
too
thin
for
me
pours
a
drab
hazy
copper
with
a
taut
ring
as
the
only
remnants
of
a
onceglorious
head
aroma
of
suppressed
malts
faint
honey
and
the
everpresent
ginger
similar
to
ginger
beer
but
surprisingly
mellower
overall
flavored
like
a
fresh
pilsner
with
some
breadiness
in
the
finish
and
ginger
essence
defining
the
entire
taste
experience
goes
down
easy
and
is
just
carbonated
enough
was
particularly
good
company
for
my
spicy
chinese
lunch
this
beer
is
better
than
average
still
a
onetrick
pony
if
left
hand
comes
up
with
any
better
beers
to
knock
this
off
the
roster
i
say
do
it
i
gave
the
drinkabilty
a
4
because
it
is
very
easy
to
chug
these
down
the
same
as
drinking
water
i
cant
imagine
a
better
beer
in
this
style
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
highly
recommended
this
one
pours
a
fairly
average
yellow
color
but
with
a
fat
white
head
with
some
activity
the
smell
is
a
bit
spicey
some
ginger
but
not
a
ton
and
a
decent
hop
and
yeast
presence
too
the
taste
is
very
yeasty
to
start
with
a
fair
amount
of
spice
nonginger
spices
as
well
and
finishes
with
a
twinge
of
fruity
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
i
sorta
reminded
me
of
a
white
beer
without
the
orange
flavors
i
have
to
say
i
liked
it
but
im
not
big
on
spiced
beers
so
it
may
be
some
time
before
i
give
it
another
shot
i
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
the
hickory
hop
festival
this
summer
and
the
beer
seemed
to
taste
much
better
then
more
pungent
ginger
and
just
more
freshness
guess
draft
is
better
in
this
beer
drinakability
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
different
to
quaff
and
forget
this
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
budweiser
look
elsewhere
if
you
like
complexity
in
a
brew
pours
a
color
somewhere
between
gold
and
copper
with
a
small
light
whispy
head
plenty
of
carbonation
actually
the
appearance
is
not
unlike
a
good
nonalcoholic
ginger
beer
aroma
is
not
the
most
pleasant
in
the
world
adjunct
lager
with
a
touch
of
ginger
palate
is
again
like
ginger
beer
slightly
spicy
ginger
flavor
up
front
developing
a
bit
of
a
malty
character
midpalate
nice
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
ginger
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
about
perfect
for
the
level
of
flavor
body
can
become
a
bit
foamy
if
youre
active
with
it
but
its
not
too
bad
on
a
95
degree
day
in
north
carolina
this
rather
hits
the
spot
pours
an
almost
clear
copper
color
that
is
topped
by
a
pale
tan
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
of
course
dominated
by
fresh
cut
spicy
ginger
it
is
really
quite
fresh
and
zesty
the
taste
is
light
and
quite
dry
on
the
palate
the
dryness
of
the
beer
tends
to
mute
the
ginger
a
bit
at
least
compared
to
the
levels
in
the
nose
the
ginger
is
still
the
most
evident
character
though
lots
of
spicy
herbal
ginger
notes
almost
make
it
up
through
my
sinuses
as
i
sip
on
this
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
one
dimensional
of
course
but
it
is
refreshing
and
quite
gingery
and
i
like
ginger
im
a
fan
nicely
done
left
hand
im
feeling
higher
than
a
lion
in
zion
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
a
spicy
kick
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
makes
for
a
great
midday
brew
flavor
is
well
rounded
and
not
weighted
down
with
ginger
very
simple
but
works
well
drinkability
not
bad
and
has
lots
of
nice
flavors
i
would
just
like
to
see
this
reformulated
to
taste
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
this
beautiful
deep
gold
ale
clearly
delivers
a
ginger
punch
without
going
overboard
and
backs
it
with
a
lightly
sweet
maltiness
and
firm
bitterness
its
fairly
onesided
as
you
might
guess
but
it
is
refreshing
and
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
biking
or
during
a
fishing
excursion
one
of
these
just
might
be
what
the
doctor
ordered
one
dimensional
trick
pony
that
left
me
wanting
more
12
oz
bottled
on
121404
looks
like
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
with
a
slight
cloudiness
and
a
1
finger
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
aroma
is
ginger
up
front
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
behind
that
the
beer
is
thin
and
metallic
with
a
ginger
kick
kinda
like
carbonated
water
with
some
ginger
flavor
and
it
has
a
hop
bitterness
i
only
found
in
the
last
sip
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
ginger
isnt
unpleasant
i
just
wish
there
were
more
beer
flavors
behind
it
nothing
great
on
its
own
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
decent
with
food
drinkability
would
be
great
if
you
love
ginger
but
i
was
always
a
mary
ann
type
of
guy
i
think
this
would
be
an
interesting
brew
to
serve
with
heavily
spiced
indian
or
nepalese
or
even
asian
food
i
just
wounldnt
make
it
a
regular
in
my
fridge
i
gotta
call
it
like
i
see
it
weak
thematic
brew
with
irie
on
the
label
ooh
and
the
irie
lion
and
the
colors
of
the
jamaican
flag
a
stoners
homebrew
at
first
i
was
going
to
call
it
coors
with
color
and
fresh
ginger
but
thats
a
bit
gratuitous
how
bout
fat
tire
scrubbed
over
a
washboard
with
fresh
ginger
and
coors
light
thats
better
and
this
isnt
cheap
beer
it
was
6
for
a
friggin
4pack
sprtzy
looking
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
overwhelming
ginger
smell
from
the
time
you
pop
the
top
very
sweet
smlling
golden
color
with
little
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
color
seems
to
seperate
perhaps
it
is
the
glass
but
the
top
is
darkermore
bronzed
while
the
bottom
is
more
yellow
the
more
i
sniff
i
can
also
pick
up
the
hops
but
again
the
ginger
is
over
powering
the
taste
is
weird
catching
me
off
guard
sweet
odd
taste
of
ginger
with
very
bubbly
carbonation
and
light
hopping
i
was
expecting
more
toawrds
ginger
ale
but
this
has
way
more
ginger
flavor
then
artificially
flavored
soda
i
dont
know
how
to
grade
the
taste
because
i
dont
have
any
comaprison
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
flavor
but
if
you
like
ginger
you
almsot
certainly
will
it
just
isnt
up
my
alley
light
body
and
high
soda
like
carbonation
make
for
a
fiesta
in
the
mouth
but
that
ginger
taste
jsut
gets
to
me
worth
a
try
just
to
try
soemthing
different
but
not
amazing
definitely
a
different
brew
pours
a
light
copper
with
very
little
head
smell
is
light
and
pleasant
with
mainly
a
ginger
aroma
taste
is
lightly
sweet
on
the
front
light
ginger
falvor
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
low
abv
and
smoothness
make
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasant
a
good
brew
to
have
for
an
occasional
change
of
pace
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
ginger
in
it
but
it
is
backed
by
a
nice
malt
with
a
caramel
smell
the
flavor
is
all
ginger
too
much
in
fact
i
cant
detect
any
other
flavors
because
the
ginger
is
too
strong
thin
as
well
this
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
cover
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
all
ginger
not
much
more
than
that
in
there
the
flavor
is
also
lacking
as
well
giving
just
the
ginger
in
there
and
not
much
beer
to
be
had
the
feel
is
thin
as
well
as
it
warms
there
is
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
base
to
it
wtih
some
citrus
flavors
coming
through
but
the
nose
is
all
ginger
still
drinkability
suffers
from
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
nose
i
want
more
than
just
the
ginger
in
there
drinkablility
is
ok
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
ginger
loving
macro
drinker
i
am
a
big
ginger
fan
and
was
really
hoping
and
expecting
more
from
left
hand
i
suppose
this
would
make
a
good
summer
quaffer
or
lawnmower
beer
with
a
few
fixes
juju
ginger
could
be
good
more
malt
lose
the
saaz
jack
up
the
ginger
and
cut
the
carbonation
by
half
now
thats
a
beer
that
id
buy
in
a
heartbeat
although
i
believe
that
it
has
too
many
faults
as
is
it
may
be
exactly
what
the
boys
at
left
hand
were
shooting
for
ill
happily
finish
the
bomber
however
and
will
dream
of
what
could
have
been
this
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
this
poured
out
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
tall
rocky
white
foam
head
not
much
retention
as
the
head
goes
quickly
leaving
some
sticky
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
aroma
is
fairly
weak
but
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
ginger
standing
out
over
sweet
malt
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
sweet
malt
taste
being
slightly
tweaked
by
the
ginger
and
a
slight
earthy
hops
presence
very
light
overall
taste
with
a
slight
lingering
ginger
after
taste
this
has
about
a
light
to
medium
body
with
a
clean
crisp
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
all
right
i
do
like
ginger
and
without
that
this
beer
has
little
else
to
offer
an
interesting
brew
that
would
probably
pair
up
well
with
sushi
though
it
is
fairly
weak
in
the
smell
and
taste
department
this
could
be
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
kind
of
beer
since
there
is
little
offensive
in
this
not
bad
but
something
i
would
only
drink
again
with
a
meal
that
fits
its
flavor
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
and
sports
litttle
to
no
head
and
only
a
trace
of
lace
aromas
are
first
of
malt
then
subtle
ginger
then
a
splash
of
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
though
id
hoped
for
more
of
a
ginger
bite
flavors
are
somewhat
muted
as
far
as
the
ginger
element
this
comes
off
more
like
a
light
pale
ale
with
some
spice
the
beer
finishes
sweetishly
malty
a
decent
refresher
nonetheless
thanks
for
the
try
bum
is
this
the
joke
beer
of
your
most
recent
shipment
probably
shouldnt
review
this
one
as
i
didnt
think
id
like
it
from
the
get
go
i
love
ginger
but
obviously
not
in
my
beer
it
had
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
white
speckeled
head
the
smell
of
ginger
and
hops
seemed
to
creep
out
it
was
drinkable
but
not
for
my
taste
somewhat
bitter
and
spicey
also
seemed
thin
to
me
some
have
compared
it
to
ginger
ale
which
also
wasnt
a
favorite
of
mine
but
id
rather
drink
that
yes
this
is
very
drinkable
but
it
isnt
great
either
in
the
uniqueness
or
the
overall
experience
departments
not
offensive
but
not
great
either
the
beer
after
departing
the
22
ounce
brown
bottle
takes
up
residence
in
my
glass
a
limpid
amber
color
with
a
portly
light
tan
head
that
is
also
frothy
in
texture
the
lace
forms
a
nice
thick
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
ginger
fresh
and
clean
start
is
sweet
the
malt
acceptable
and
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
mild
acidity
the
hops
personable
and
they
become
a
bit
spicier
as
the
beer
warms
to
the
room
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
big
hit
with
me
drinakability
is
average
imho
very
nice
effort
but
one
was
enough
for
me
id
rather
have
a
ginger
ale
overall
this
is
not
that
bad
an
offering
for
a
ginger
ale
but
i
cannot
see
anyone
who
never
liked
ginger
ale
before
taking
to
this
for
me
i
think
it
is
a
decent
attempt
at
something
that
rarely
seems
to
be
attempted
these
days
a
nice
first
beer
after
work
on
what
has
been
a
hot
day
worth
trying
medium
copper
color
faint
white
head
clumpy
and
quickly
faded
for
a
ginger
beer
really
lacked
any
ginger
smells
nothing
noticable
anyway
and
really
nothing
like
the
ginger
ale
softdrink
to
be
sure
taste
was
moderate
at
best
some
mild
hops
faint
biscuit
malts
underneath
some
toasty
breads
no
real
ginger
presence
for
a
ginger
beer
it
really
lacked
ginger
flavor
not
that
i
am
expert
on
these
beers
but
really
just
tasted
like
an
amber
ale
medium
to
light
bodied
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
alot
of
flavors
here
pours
a
dark
shade
of
orange
with
a
quick
dissapearing
headaroma
of
course
is
dominated
by
fresh
ginger
kinda
sweet
and
and
spicey
pretty
provacative
taste
is
of
ginger
for
sure
with
a
toasted
malt
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
finishtastes
better
as
it
warms
a
little
a
pretty
unique
beer
not
one
i
would
get
to
often
but
not
all
that
bad
pours
a
translucent
apricotgold
color
despite
the
longlasting
effervescence
feeding
it
the
head
is
minimal
and
quite
fine
the
worst
part
of
the
smell
is
that
it
is
so
muted
sweet
but
subtle
malts
are
there
as
is
the
spice
of
ginger
one
would
expect
this
beer
is
crafted
on
a
base
of
nondescript
grains
but
predictably
it
is
livened
up
with
the
infusion
of
ginger
to
left
hands
credit
the
ginger
is
well
integrated
manifesting
itself
first
in
straight
ginger
flavor
as
the
initial
malts
fade
and
then
as
a
spicy
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
good
and
while
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
im
unlikely
to
be
inspired
to
reach
for
it
again
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
like
ginger
and
all
but
id
never
been
a
fan
of
the
nonalcoholic
ginger
ale
and
wasnt
sure
the
alcohol
would
help
it
poured
attractively
enough
a
nice
copperorange
color
with
a
moderatetothin
off
white
head
a
good
start
but
the
aroma
was
disappointing
the
gingers
there
to
be
sure
but
apart
from
that
only
a
very
light
malt
sweetness
manages
to
make
itself
noticed
the
taste
unforunately
is
more
of
the
same
ginger
right
from
the
getgo
with
the
only
relief
to
be
found
in
a
very
mild
slightly
citric
hop
finish
its
not
necessarily
that
theres
too
much
ginger
to
the
flavor
its
just
that
theres
not
enough
else
there
to
balance
or
lend
any
complexity
to
the
brew
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
finish
this
beer
actually
might
be
decent
if
paired
with
the
right
meal
asian
stir
fries
or
gingerspiced
chicken
are
the
obvious
candidates
i
just
dont
think
theres
enough
here
to
stand
on
its
own
though
came
out
a
cloudy
coppery
color
interesting
aroma
of
ginger
with
a
hint
of
aprictos
in
the
background
taste
has
a
subtle
amout
of
ginger
nicely
balanced
with
a
sweet
maltiness
aftertaste
of
apricots
comes
through
very
cleanly
magic
hat
should
make
a
9
with
a
little
ginger
thrown
in
an
excellent
summer
refresher
pleasant
gingersweet
aroma
and
a
nice
color
i
enjoyed
the
light
sweet
flavor
this
was
a
pleasantly
surprising
spice
beer
i
have
been
somewhat
impressed
with
all
of
left
hands
offerings
as
a
matter
of
fact
notes
this
beer
is
brewed
using
a
pale
ale
as
the
base
with
the
addition
of
fresh
organic
ginger
root
which
has
been
used
in
brewing
for
ages
but
is
quite
uncommon
these
days
as
a
such
juju
is
a
rare
treat
and
very
unique
a
most
refreshing
beer
i
can
also
see
this
being
a
great
chick
beer
no
offense
to
all
the
women
out
there
but
you
know
what
i
mean
or
a
great
introduction
beer
for
those
who
dont
really
like
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
definitely
drinks
below
its
abv
and
the
light
hand
used
in
the
spicing
works
well
in
this
application
some
yeasty
fruit
aromas
with
some
spice
probably
nutmeg
dominate
the
nose
it
pours
reddish
gold
to
garnet
chestnut
under
a
finely
bubbled
1
tan
tinted
white
foam
collar
the
palate
begins
with
dried
fruit
flavors
a
trace
of
earthiness
some
toffee
sweetness
dark
sugars
and
a
range
of
spices
including
nutmeg
it
has
a
very
creamy
medium
bodied
texture
driven
by
very
fine
soft
carbonation
besides
being
very
interested
in
this
beer
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
brewed
in
a
medieval
castle
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
with
specs
of
hops
and
spices
floating
around
the
color
almost
resembles
an
iced
tea
right
on
the
first
taste
i
noticed
the
crisp
brightness
it
is
very
refreshing
and
the
spices
blended
work
well
with
the
nonfiltered
brew
belgium
beers
never
disappoint
this
one
is
very
good
the
8
5
alcvol
is
hidden
well
with
the
almost
creamy
aftertaste
but
it
warms
you
nicely
i
would
love
to
drink
this
outdoors
on
a
cold
night
overall
i
would
highly
suggest
trying
this
one
before
the
cold
weather
ends
bottle
poured
a
semiopaque
amber
color
with
a
proud
head
smells
neutral
a
little
sweet
a
little
spicy
malt
forward
no
hops
maybe
a
bit
medicinal
the
first
sip
did
nothing
for
me
the
yeast
brings
a
strong
bite
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
by
any
means
but
they
also
make
me
rear
back
a
bit
the
second
sip
and
those
following
after
are
mostly
more
enjoyable
i
adjust
to
the
flavor
and
pick
out
some
nuances
almost
like
a
spiced
bread
its
not
overly
sweetmwhich
is
a
plus
for
my
palate
the
belgian
aspects
of
the
beer
arent
allencompassing
i
like
that
but
i
am
also
a
bit
confused
as
to
what
the
thesis
of
this
beer
is
its
kinda
belgian
kinda
spicy
kinda
bland
i
dont
know
the
best
part
of
this
one
is
its
body
and
alcohol
masking
the
anne
frank
of
alcohol
i
had
no
idea
this
one
shivd
me
with
its
alcohol
content
to
finish
the
story
this
one
was
not
a
beer
i
would
come
back
to
o
interesting
i
was
expecting
more
body
from
and
winter
seasonal
rjt
decent
definitely
deserves
the
spiced
beer
categorization
though
the
spices
themselves
and
the
beer
in
general
arent
very
remarkable
i
just
couldnt
turn
this
bottle
down
after
seeing
it
on
the
seasonal
shelf
at
total
wine
damn
this
ticking
urge
anyway
it
pours
a
partlycloudy
sunset
bronzeamber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
pumpernickel
clove
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
light
candied
orange
peel
and
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
an
increased
level
of
dark
fruits
though
make
no
mistake
the
rest
particularly
the
spices
especially
newlyarrived
ginger
and
cinnamon
doesnt
fade
without
a
fight
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
spiced
winter
brew
if
nothing
all
that
special
id
certainly
have
another
though
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
hazy
copper
with
a
finger
and
a
half
length
offwhite
head
there
are
bubbles
visible
rising
along
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
malty
aromas
as
well
as
some
scent
of
toffee
fruit
and
some
spice
the
fruity
aroma
is
akin
to
plum
and
fig
the
spice
notes
are
mostly
coriander
the
flavors
are
of
bready
pilsner
malt
with
a
stronger
spice
note
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
nose
the
coriander
comes
out
but
i
also
get
some
hints
of
pepper
orange
peel
and
anise
that
other
reviewers
picked
out
the
sweetness
is
pretty
balanced
out
with
the
abundant
spice
bouquet
in
this
beer
the
fruity
notes
come
out
a
little
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warming
quality
not
much
of
the
aftertaste
lingers
in
this
beer
allowing
a
stronger
drinkability
for
this
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
yeast
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
this
is
a
great
christmas
beer
lots
of
sweet
fruity
flavor
with
a
touch
of
spice
quite
drinkable
but
better
to
sip
and
savor
overall
this
is
one
im
going
to
look
for
each
season
to
go
with
my
other
favorite
christmas
ales
despite
its
giant
references
the
beer
is
small
on
the
palate
and
stomach
making
it
supple
and
elegant
ale
its
both
charming
and
soft
but
its
overall
light
profile
keeps
me
wanting
more
strength
power
and
complexity
o
lots
of
complexity
bu
too
many
disconnected
flavors
to
be
appealing

easy

overall
the
taste
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
fruitcake
which
is
a
good
thing
for
a
christmas
themed
beer
i
guess
problem
is
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruitcake
still
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
this
is
clearly
a
holiday
specialty
but
should
not
be
confused
with
the
more
spectacular
beers
of
the
season
its
one
of
the
best
xmas
beers
ive
ever
enjoyed
and
apparently
its
underrated
its
not
a
kickyou
in
the
head
with
flavor
beer
but
it
really
satisfies
as
a
unique
sipper
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
a
nice
belgian
ale
ive
enjoyed
this
christmas
5
pack
from
shelton
bros
o
since
this
is
a
belgian
noel
i
was
not
expecting
the
large
amount
of
spice
that
dominates
this
beer
the
finish
is
a
bit
abrasive
and
lingering
overall
the
spice
could
have
been
balanced
better
o
strikingly
similar
to
rosee
dhibiscus
but
tastes
a
bit
better
imo
its
a
strange
beer
but
it
worked
for
me
the
abv
level
of
8
5
is
perfect
for
a
beer
and
despite
the
highish
number
it
was
well
hidden
making
it
very
drinkable
id
love
to
have
another
one
in
the
future
o
one
of
the
nicer
winter
ales
overall
this
is
a
neat
christmas
beer
the
belgian
yeast
plays
nice
with
all
the
other
flavors
the
spices
are
in
the
right
proportion
would
definitely
drink
this
again
o
again
this
was
good
but
not
great
wouldnt
buy
this
again
3
5
i
like
it
very
understated
poured
dark
with
a
reddish
hue
head
was
offwhite
and
dissipated
quickly
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
almost
no
aroma
the
carbonation
is
adequate
and
it
has
an
earthy
taste
that
reminds
me
of
good
farming
soil
and
old
shoe
leather
i
did
not
pick
up
some
of
the
plum
and
cherry
mentioned
by
other
reviewers
but
thats
probably
my
palate
and
not
theres
pours
a
dark
brown
color
w
a
thin
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
the
smell
is
really
weak
i
mean
really
weak
i
barely
get
anything
other
than
some
woody
notes
spices
and
some
malt
all
extremely
understated
the
taste
is
slightly
better
the
woodyearthiness
and
spices
are
the
main
thing
here
but
still
a
little
weak
on
taste
feel
is
medium
with
little
carbonation
and
somewhat
dry
finish
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
probably
wont
look
for
it
again
cheers
overall
a
pretty
respectable
brew
and
one
that
is
good
for
cold
winter
nights
o
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
id
buy
it
again
seems
just
right
for
a
cold
winter
night
or
a
holiday
celebration
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
wouldnt
be
my
pick
for
a
fave
but
it
definitely
is
intriguing
and
thought
provoking
this
brew
is
on
sale
at
rollin
oats
for
0
99
a
bottle
right
now
needless
to
say
my
fridge
is
full
of
christmas
giant
beer
the
brew
pours
a
rustic
golden
mauveish
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
fingers
worth
of
antique
white
head
the
nose
is
spicy
and
earthy
and
seems
to
have
notes
of
chamomile
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
flavor
best
described
as
something
between
sahti
and
bspa
it
is
not
terribly
sweet
it
hides
abv
well
and
is
quite
tealike
overall
i
like
it
but
i
could
see
it
being
a
big
turnoff
for
others
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
cloudy
red
colored
body
the
head
was
white
and
fluffy
it
settles
within
a
minute
or
so
and
leaves
a
light
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
spicy
herbal
notes
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
yeasty
and
a
bit
spicy
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
decent
had
a
nice
carbonation
level
and
body
mass
overall
its
not
a
bad
winter
brew
but
i
could
have
been
better
i
would
probably
try
this
one
again
if
i
saw
it
again
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
well
made
the
spices
are
not
overdone
initially
i
thought
i
was
getting
into
a
belgian
dark
strong
ale
but
was
very
surprised
to
be
greeted
by
the
big
spice
nose
so
in
the
first
week
of
may
im
bustin
out
a
holiday
beer
xmas
year
round
bottles
were
on
sale
for
1
99
each
so
i
picked
one
up
during
my
weekly
beer
run
poured
beautifully
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
held
on
for
a
good
long
time
color
was
brown
and
warm
nose
was
fig
like
with
hints
of
spice
cinnamon
mostly
taste
was
comforting
and
christmassy
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
kinda
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
at
this
price
id
be
opening
up
my
second
or
third
by
this
point

the

to
the
max
it
can
be
done
without
being
overpowering
creating
a

drinkability
definitely
takes
a
hit
because
for
me
the
aroma
distracts
from
the
taste
and
makes
it
harder
to

enjoy

this
was
aged
for
a
year
disappointng
was
expecting
a
homerun
by
any
means
but
this
was
just
plain
d
not
bad
for
a
christmas
beer
a
bit
spicy
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
its
one
drink
a
person
should
have
at
least
once
because
of
the
history
behind
the
brewery
but
the
price
of
the
beer
reflects
its
rareness
and
honestly
not
its
quality
the
flavor
is
nice
w
mild
dry
spice
and
woodcinnamony
w
a
hint
of
date
and
light

playing
off
the
spice
and
malt
sweetness
in
a
way
that
melds
well
i
dig
the
mild
tannin
keeping
it
in
the
front
of
the
palate
and
slight
blend
of
raisin
date
and
grassy
elements
with
mild
nuttiness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
seriously
complex
beer
that
i
didnt
think
much
of
til
it
got
warmer
toward
cellar
temp
it
really
opens
up
and
the
last
drops
of
yeast
added
some
nice
belgian
character
along
with
the
malty
spice
i
would
not
drink
multiples
of
but
great
for
what
it
is
d
all
of
the
spices
make
this
beer
a
slow
sipper
even
though
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
the
taste
is
rather
complex
and
the
spices
leave
you
longing
for
another
sip
loving
specialty
belgian
beers
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
its
a
goldenamber
color
completely
clear
with
a
white
thick
tuftladen
head
wonderful
the
smell
is
a
little
muted
a
little
spice
and
a
touch
of
pale
malt
the
smell
could
be
a
much
more
intense
and
interesting
the
beer
however
has
a
very
flavorful
taste
malt
honey
peppery
spice
peppermintesque
great
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
silky
very
soft
and
full
room
for
improvement
sure
but
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
christmas
beer
pours
a
clody
copper
oranges
with
a
deep
thick
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
smells
of
ginger
and
spices
taste
is
a
bit
one
dimentional
it
has
no
body
or
depth
to
it
as
belgian
ales
go
this
one
is
pretty
light
its
seems
like
a
well
made
beer
i
am
just
looking
for
more
when
it
comes
to
a
belgian
ale
d
christmas
my
christmas
im
creepin
up
on
a
mothachristmas
buzz
from
this
bottle
when
the
radiator
is
right
by
your
computer
and
its
18
degrees
outside
without
the
wind
chill
and
you
spent
the
last
7
hours
in
the
mall
and
at
kmart
and
the
store
with
clothes
for
dogs
and
you
picked
up
this
beer
at
world
market
and
it
was
soso
rambling
on
like
this
makes
the
bottle
go
faster
a
bottle
that
i
otherwise
may
have
recorked
capped
and
put
to
the
side
while
i
popped
that
taddy
porter
thats
been
winking
at
me
drink
is
decent
with
light
warming
and
tingly
booze
and
spices
that
come
on
a
little
strong
but
not
overpowering
a
decent
dry
finish
and
for
a
winter
ale
not
too
heavy
d
this
was
more
like
mulled
cider
than
beer
but
it
was
quite
interesting
and
tasty
nice
scent
and
flavor
with
great
body
and
no
noticeable
alcohol
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
all
the
spices
did
become
a
bit
tedious
by
the
end
of
the
glass
this
seemed
like
a
beer
that
would
be
best
fresh
so
dont
bother
cellaring
unless
you
want
to
really
experiment
great
change
of
pace
drink
d
very
a
good
holiday
ale
not
as
heavy
dark
and
warm
as
some
of
my
favorite
christmas
ales
but
a
very
good
one
and
i
will
be
getting
again
d
very
good
seasonal
drink
easy
to
consume
especially
with
the
complex
nature
of
the
herbal
earthy
ingredients
a
perfect
drink
for
the
holiday
season
highly
recommended
overall
impression
unexpected
mouthfeel
for
a
belgian
style
reminiscent
of
a
domestic
style
subtle
alcohol
this
is
more
cloyingly
sweet
after
the
first
glass
while
it
is
a
good
offering
for
the
holidays
id
rather
just
have
one
glass
and
move
on
to
something
else
nevertheless
i
did
manage
to
finish
the
75
cl
bottle
over
dinner
this
was
ok
it
definitely
had
that
festive
gingerbread
cookiefruit
cake
thing
going
on
with
it
that
a
lot
of
these
christmas
beers
seem
to
shoot
for
i
dont
know
i
just
didnt
get
the
complexity
out
of
this
that
some
other
reviewers
did
this
was
a
pleasant
but
ultimately
didnt
leave
a
huge
impression
on
me
i
decanted
it
slowly
ending
up
with
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
deeptan
head
that
quickly
fizzed
its
way
out
of
existence
and
into
wisps
color
was
a
deep
copperyred
with
neplus
quality
clarity
nose
had
a
vinous
grapey
quality
up
front
along
with
the
chewing
tobacco
sweetness
mentioned
by
the
previous
reviewer
mouthfeel
was
very
full
with
a
lot
of
huge
carbonic
bubbles
leading
the
way
the
taste
was
unique
a
blend
of
raisin
bourbon
tobacco
and
lemon
zest
frankly
it
was
like
a
cocktail
more
than
a
beer
oh
those
crazy
belgians
and
the
crazier
shelton
brothers
for
importing
such
beers
finish
combined
the
lemon
zestiness
with
the
vinous
quality
of
the
nose
for
a
dryness
that
would
have
put
many
martinis
to
shame
phew
this
begged
for
an
h2o
chaser
ill
tell
you
i
am
all
for
dry
but
this
was
on
a
sahara
desert
scale
with
the
zephyr
winds
blowing
past
recommendation
let
this
one
warm
into
the
high
50s
before
reviewing
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
showing
a
bit
of
age
around
the
edges
and
is
fairly
complex
but
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
something
to
really
make
it
a
great
beer
overall
enjoyable
but
can
get
lost
in
the
crowd
of
other
belgian
beers
out
there
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
and
because
it
adds
nothing
past
intoxication
potential
i
cant
see
why
this
beer
needs
to
be
8

abv
pours
a
murky
caramel
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
little
yeasties
hang
around
smells
malty
bready
and
boozey
tastes
chocolatey
some
vanilla
plum
even
has
some
rum
raisen
notes
ghost
hops
add
bitterness
medium
to
full

a
little
chalky
due
to
the
yeast
then
finishes
dry
spices
have
died
down
to
a
slight
notion
easily
drank
good
beer
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
enough
going
on
to
hate
or
love
its
just
a
hohum
belgianstyle
ale
with
a
bit
of
spice
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
malt
belgian
earthiness
candi
sugar
and
spice
juniper
berries
but
it
doesnt
amount
to
anything
particularly
exciting
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
actually
the
beer
is
generally
fairly
weak
for
8
5
abv
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
id
recommend
with
so
many
excellent
belgian
ales
around
d
good
for
a
single
serving
the
abv
is
moderate
at
8
5abv
provides
just
the
right
amount
of
warmth
without
hinderance
warm
piney
with
licorice
and
dried
honey
gives
this
a
wintery
feel
worthy
of
a
try
my
only
regret
is
that
i
only
bought
one
bottle
and
will
most
likely
have
to
wait
until
next
christmas
to
drink
it
again
drinkability
it
does
display
a
curious
complexity
but
i
simply
didnt
care
for
the
particular
mix
of
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
like
a
first
date
where
there
was
just
no
connection
no
spark
however
its
one
i
may
potentially
revisit
in
the
winter
of
this
new
year
look
im
putting
in
on
my
365
days
of
puppies
calendar
this
very
moment
dec
5th
a
golden
retriever
pup
d
overall
what
a
great
brew
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
its
not
your
everyday
kinda
beer
even
for
a
belgian
its
unique
thats
what
i
like
about
it
i
will
be
visiting
this
one
again
for
sure
d
its
a
good
sipper
but
more
than
two
would
be
a
stretch
d
this
is
a
tasty
spiced
beer
i
was
tempted
to
pick
this
up
in
december
but
i
waited
and
snagged
a
single
for
1
50
which
was
a
steal
a
spicy
complex
winter
seasonal
that
scores
points
for
originality
pours
a
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
a
full
finger
loose
light
tan
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
the
smell
is
really
nice
and
complex
an
aggressive
earthy
fruity
fig
apple
and
caramel
a
nice
amount
of
creamy
effervescence
bright
and
tangy
the
mouth
feel
is
mediumfull
bodied
the
flavors
arent
as
pronounced
as
the
nose
but
the
earthy
harvest
fruit
and
caramel
characteristics
are
savory
the
8
5
abv
is
a
bit
of
a
warmer
but
otherwise
well
integrated
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
spin
this
beer
is
called
christmas
of
the
giants
because
it
is
brewed
in
the
irchonwelz
castle
in
irchonwelz
belgium
the
gate
stands
high
to
allow
the
passage
of
the
ocassional
visiting
giant
my
visit
with
this
giant
was
a
good
one
and
at
1
99
a
355
ml
i
might
just
have
to
revisit
it
again
good
drinkability
drinkability
a
nice
flavored
beer
that
is
a
bit
of
a
slow
sipper
more
than
one
could
be
enjoyed
in
a
session
but
the
well
hidden
alcohol
will
creep
up
on
you
nice
christmas
brew
that
is
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
spiced
beer
all
the
way
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
and
one
whos
attractiveness
is
enhanced
by

after
that
making
it
one
of
my
better
buys
of
2009
pours
a
rich
goldenorange
color
quite
warm
hues
which
are
nice
on
a
cold
winter
day
minimal
head
but
does
not
really
matter
aroma
and
taste
is
mainly
of
spices
clove
cinnamon
and
perhaps
most
of
all
nutmeg
with
hints
of
fruit
and
vanilla
feel
is
rich
complex
and
warming
very
good
winter
warmer
type
beer
overall
a
solid
brew
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
5
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
beer
but
it
definitely
impressed
me
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
crystal
malt
and
dark
candy
sugar
aroma
along
with
a
classy
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
its
a
smooth
drinker
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
yeast
fruitiness
there
is
a
light
spice
character
in
the
finish
im
detecting
coriander
and
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
belgian
noel
its
mildly
spiced
and
quite
enjoyable
d
my
second
favorite
christmas
beer
of
the
2009
season
so
far
very
nice
indeed
not
bad
nothing
too
dramatic
poured
with
a
nice
large
off
white
to
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
a
while
and
great
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
copper
aroma
is
a
little
malty
and
caramel
a
hint
of
fruit
and
yeast
flavor
is
mild
mostly
caramel
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
perfume
body
is
nice
and
so
is
carbonation
definite
alcohol
in
the
finish
decent
beer
in
a
general
sort
of
way
d
smells
like
a
belgian
but
finishes
very
sweet
rich
ill
look
for
this
in
a
singles
store
but
doubt
id
buy
a
case
because
im
sure
it
fetches
a
pretty
penny
when
i
poured
the
beer
i
noticed
a
lite
head
on
it
almost
as
if
the
beer
appeared
to
be
a
little
under
carbonated
the
color
was
a
light
golden
brown
and
very
clear
aroma
wise
i
picked
up
a
nutty
raisin
like
quality
tasting
this
beer
i
got
a
nice
nutmeg
like
flavor
i
also
picked
up
a
yeasty
character
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
the
after
taste
was
mild
tarty
that
left
very
little
flavor
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
got
warmer
this
was
a
easy
sipper
that
would
be
great
after
spending
a
full
day
shopping
with
the
family
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
a
lot
of
sweet
estery
belgian
yeast
providing
some
nice
dark
fruit
notes
followed
by
an
earthy
toasted
subtle
malt
body
and
slightly
syrupy
cloyingly
sweet
medicinal
flavor
subtle
spice
mostly
peppery
peppermint
and
pine
needle
very
subtly
tart
with
a
bit
of
vinegar
feel
astringent
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
layers
of
dry
sugar
flavors
that
balance
with
the
fizz
notes
and
the
hop
notes
there
are
interesting
apple
qualities
that
remain
in
the
background
very
attractive
hazy
brownishburnt
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lace
nose
is
mild
but
very
nice
lots
of
burnt
toffee
caramel
dark
sugars
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
all
on
top
of
a
bit
of
a
musty
cellary
character
that
is
synonymous
with
proper
belgian
breweries
taste
is
more
of
the
same
ringing
out
in
pretty
good
balance
with
a
dry
earthy
herbal
finish
that
definitely
involves
a
little
bit
of
a
hopping
relatively
slick
mouthfeel
that
carries
a
touch
of
bitter
without
being
prickly
nice
one
shelton
brothers
dont
seem
to
dissapoint
try
goliath
from
the
same
brewer
if
you
can
find
it
dthe
fact
that
this
beer
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
significantly
cuts
into
its
drinkability
for
me
its
a
one
and
done
beer
i
was
glad
to
try
it
but
its
doubtful
i
will
ever
purchase
it
again
d
the
carbonation
and
hops
on
the
finish
crisp
things
up
nicely
and
make
this
very
drinkable
but
the
spices
and
sweetness
force
you
to
slow
down
and
sip
on
this
one
for
awhile
which
is
nice
during
the
colder
months
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
with
nothing
being
over
done
there
is
lots
of
subtle
balance
and
with
moderate
sweetness
that
refreshes
rather
than
cloys
and
dominates
the
operative
words
for
this
beer
are
balanced
and
subtle
i
certainly
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
when
the
opportunity
presents
d
although
this
beer
is
going
down
mostly
smooth
without
the
alcohol
peeking
through
the
intense
spice
component
is
a
little
rough
after
about
half
the
bottle
as
is
the
huge
sweetness
overall
an
interesting
beer
perhaps
a
treat
to
share
with
a
friend
after
dessert
but
on
its
own
its
quite
inyourface
pours
a
five
finger
pale
tan
head
that
fades
very
slowly
to
a
thin
layer

a
some

know
some
folks
like
this
it
may
just
not
be
for
me
the
appearnce
was
a
murky
dark
redbrown
with
a
tan
head
overall
the
beer
is
balanced
but
i
just
dont
like
how
it
tastes
pleasant
drinkability
this
highly
drinkable
ale
is
potentially
dangerous
since
it
would
go
well
with
some
strong
foods
particularly
certain
creamy
cheeses
and
one
might
just
keep
on
going
without
engaging
the
thinking
area
alluring
roasted
vanilla
aromas
tightly
wrapped
berry
phenols
seem
to
lurk
inside
crunchy
ripe
red
and
black
berry
skins
on
the
palate
it
is
very
sweet
with
alcohol
nice
silky
texture
very
low
acidity
i
tend
to
like
more
still
natural
feel
with
sweet
plummy
prune
licuor
flavors
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
with
some
sugary
fruit
and
heat
found
in
the
finish
strong
alcohol
warmth
a
little
too
potent
for
my
tastes
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
indicate
relatively
thin
with
a
respectively
high
carbonation
level
i
cant
detect
any
spices
the
aftertaste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
hop
bitterness
and
the
remnants
of
malt
sugars
still
the
alcohol
overwhelms
all
of
the
subtlety
of
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
nice
head
initially
but
this
fades
to
a
ring
no
real
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
christmas
spices
smells
somewhat
boozy
and
warming
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
also
malty
boozy
spicy
and
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
orange
peel
which
blend
nicely
with
the
holiday
spices
warming
and
moderately
sweet
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
new
brewery
for
me
and
based
on
this
ill
definitely
try
some
other
offerings
from
them
there
is
a
bite
of
ginger
or
some
other
spice
on
the
finish
that
i
particularly
like
a
nice
holiday
brew
a
great
holiday
ale
that
has
depth
and
complexity
while
alcohol
is
not
invisible
it
never
calls
attention
to
itself
inviting
a
session
that
should
never
be
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
a
hazy
brown
ale
has
a
nice
creamy
egg
nog
colored
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
there
sweet
notes
of
peach
and
apricot
up
front
in
the
aroma
hints
of
cinnamon
and
clove
hover
in
the
background
at
first
the
is
a
candy
sweetness
that
brushes
over
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
a
herbfloral
hop
note
that
catches
at
the
back
of
your
throat
as
it
warms
tabacco
and
cinnamon
flavors
dance
around
in
your
mouth
drinkability
is
ok
theres
a
lot
going
on
if
you
try
to
break
it
down
but
they
all
seem
to
almost
neutralize
each
other
leaving
a
peppery
burn
that
isnt
helped
by
the
crisp
foamy
mouthfeel
the
abv
isnt
apparent
however
its
not
to
digestible

whatever
reason

pick
up

a

that

was
a
pleasant
mix
of
spciy
clove

banana
as
well
as
a
hint
of
other
fruitiness
mouthfeel
of
this
mediumbodied
beer
was
carbonated
and
tingly
with
a
spicy
malty
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
fruit
this
all
rounded
to
a
nice
dry
clinging
finish
i
really
wouldnt
consider
this
one
a
spiced
beer
very
subtle
to
nonexistent
still
its
a
solid
belgian
brew
and
a
nice
drinker
d
tasts
good
and
you
could
have
more
but
ill
probably
just
have
one
too
malty
for
me
and
not
enough
spice
nice
cloudy
slightly
translucent
deep
brown
color
with
a
huge
beige
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
lasting
lacing
nose
is
very
sweet
malts
hay
and
anisespices
taste
is
sweet
belgian
malts
bourbon
and
some
vague
nuttiness
good
mouthfeel
nice
wintery
beer
very
drinkable
despite
abv
the
taste
is
very
complex
there
is
definitely
warming
alcohol
fermented
candied
sugars
sweet
caramels
and
maybe
some
florals
spices
that
are
difficult
to
pin
down
but
maybe
fennel
and
maybe
a
dark
licorice
flavor
towards
the
finish
there
is
an
abv
bite
towards
the
finish
and
this
gets
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
fairly
carbonated
beer
with
a
spritely
mouthfeel
a
bit
pricklish
on
the
tongue
the
complexity
of
the
beer
and
waves
of
overlapping
experiences
make
this
a
very
interesting
and
worthwhile
beer
to
sample
very
esy
to
drink
the
alcohol
content
takes
over
at
the
finish
may
you
have
the
happiest
of
holidays
drinkability
has
to
take
a
little
hit
because
of
the
spiciness
its
ok
but
thats
about
it
nothing
that
stands
out
as
memorable
its
not
an
easily
identified
spice
as
clove
or
cinnamon
would
be
for
example
its
more
herbal
fair
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
present
and
there
is
something
odd
about
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
certainly
not
bad
though
this
is
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
the
longer
i
sipped
on
it
and
let
it
sit
in
the
glass
there
is
almost
a
winter
warmer
aspect
to
this
beer
reminding
me
of
spiced
apple
pie
very
very
nice
beer
no
doubt
this
is
one
of
the
top
winter
seasonals
i
have
had
the
complex
flavors
are
there
and
the
drinkability
is
there
as
well
overall
an
exceptional
beer
d
this
was
a
decent
christmas
beer
i
like
the
subtle
hop
accents
in
it
however
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
per
session
based
on
the
sweetness
sampled
from
a
330ml
bottle
pours
deep
caramel
with
ruby
highlights
fluffy
off
white
two
finger
head
adorns
the
top
of
the
glass
aromas
of
candy
sugar
dark
fruit
with
sweet
floral
aroma
first
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
honey
flavors
then
out
of
nowhere
comes
a
strong
herb
flavor
which
reminds
me
of
a
chirtmas
tree
the
shelton
brothers
website
says
they
use
a
special
aromatic
herb
from
the
region
of
the
brewery
the
aftertaste
of
this
herb
is
a
bit
funky
and
it
really
dries
out
the
mouth
nothing
special
on
this
one
in
fact
it
is
tough
to
finish
the
330ml
bottle
okay
lacked
taste
for
a
yards
brew
no
aftertaste
aroma
of
light
wintery
pine
malt
caramel
taste
mild
pine
herbal
malt
spice
nice
o
meh
too
sweet
for
my
preferences
interesting
for
historical
purposes
however
as
its
pretty
likely
that
the
ales
being
produced
in
this
country
around
the
time
of
the
revolution
were
something
like
this
very
different
and
easy
drinking
i
think
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
immensely
but
only
one
at
a
sitting
and
only
every
so
often
one
of
the
best
yards
beers
an
unusually
and
delightful
change
up
session
ale
keeping
in
mind
the
time
that
the
recipe
for
this
and
all
the
other
ales
of
the
revolution
series
this
review
is
for
a
glass
at
a
cellar
temperature
when
i
had
my
first
bottle
right
out
of
the
refrigerator
the
spruce
took
over
and
ruined
the
beer
let
it
sit
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
to
let
the
caramel
bloom
and
balance
the
bitttering
components
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
each
sip
taste
is
sweet
molasses
with
some
sprucepine
at
the
finish
more
spruce
flavor
would
improve
this
imho
overall
enjoyable
to
have
one
now
and
again
my
second
favorite
of
the
ales
of
the
revolution
series
after
george
washington
i
think
i
got
myself
psyched
for
something
this
beer
is
not
is
it
a
good
decent
beer
sure
but
the
spruce
notes
are
very
subtle
i
bought
this
because
i
wanted
spruce
flavor
or
a
unique
taste
and
it
really
does
not
deliver
on
that
account
if
this
were
on
sale
and
i
wanted
beer

the
taste
has
a
nice
flavor
of
malt
up
front
with
a
woody
hop
and
the
spruce
provides
a
subtle
earthy
and
clean
element
to
the
somewhat
sweet
flavor
the
spruce
is
aromatic
and
contributes
to
the
taste
but
the
bready
taste
is
the
malts
primary
contribution
with
a
subtle
molasses
element
adding
flavor
toward
the
middle
overall
i
really
enjoy
beers
like
this
that
have
a
traditional
element
or
a
backstory
as
to
why
the
ingredients
were
used
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
and
would
probably
handle
several
in
a
sitting

nothing

i
could

the

my

becoming
more

did
they
tweak
the
recipe
in
the
last
six

finish
was
semidry
with
the
commingled
flavors
of
pine
and
molasses
really
lingering
well
after
the

but
it
does
yield
a
world
of
flavour
a
lot
of
spruce
with
hints
of
nuts
hazelnut
with
a
bit
of
malt
character
providing
backbone
the
taste
is
more
like
a
brown
ale
with
cinnamon
but
ill
only
need
to
try
one

and
other
sweet
smells
came
through
as
it
dried
the
taste
did
not
suit
me
well
at
all
only
word
i
could
think
of
is
huh
tasted
like
a
soda
mainly
because
i
think
id
be
overwhelmed
by
the
spruce
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
an
actual
colonial
tavern
wont
want
to
drink
another
not
terrible
and
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
but
but
dont
think
id
consider
it
a

the
best
of
the
historical
brews
that
have
been
popping
up
here
and
there
from

definitely

best
pumpkin
beer
out
currently
will
not
seek
out
or
purchase
again
i
dont
know
if
even
the
addition
of
pumpkin
could
have
saved
this
one
it
was
bad
on
so
many
levels
overall
i
rated
it
3
across
the
board
but
this
is
not
good
thats
average
to
most
pumpkin
beers
though
this
is
a
bottle
of
spices
and
little
else
this
beer
poured
with
almost
no
head
nothing
stood
out
in
the
smell
or
the
taste
it
was
not
terrible
taste
just
nothing
stood
out
to
make
me
ever
want
this
again
overall
i
thought
this
wasnt
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
poor
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
instead
of
letting
the
pumpkin
shine
it
was
dominated
by
the
cinnamon
and
that
didnt
let
through
any
nice
supporting
flavors
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
crisp
a
little
watery
not
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
have
no
urge
at
all
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
the
only
aspect
that
wasnt
below
average
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
taste
it
just
wasnt
good
and
it
didnt
really
have
any
redeeming
aspects
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
now
i
see
why
i
havent
had
it
in
a
couple
years
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
its
just
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
didnt
like
this
beer
arcadia
is
a
good
brewery
but
this
isnt
a
good
beer
and
i
dont
understand
why
they
choose
to
release
this
below
average
pumpkin
ale
every
year
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
arcadia
and
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
pumpkin
ales
better
luck
next
time
guys
this

fucking

beer
i
dont
want
to
try
this
again
o
probably
one
of
the
worst
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
no
real
balance
in
the
flavor
and
the
beer
is
pretty
thin
there
are
many
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
guess
one
plus
on
this
one
might
be
its
price
it
comes
in
a
6
pack
and
is
usually
under
10
bucks
pours
clear
golden
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
includes
citrus
and
nutmeg
didnt
taste
the
cinnamon
at
first
but
after
i
had
a
few
sips
it
was
prevalent
could
also
taste
some
mild
wheat
notes
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
drink
while
eating
food
due
to
its
spicy
cinnamon
flavors
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
looks
like
apple
cider
and
the
bottle
has
some
awesome
artwork
the
smell
oddly
similar
to
overripe
bananas
is
offputting
the
flavor
is
lacking
theres
a
harsh
bite
to
it
someone
called
it
sour
and
i
agree
which
makes
it
difficult
to
enjoy
on
balance
i
like
this
beer
maybe
im
just
intoxicated
by
that
pumpkin
pie
smell
the
rest
leaves
a
fair
amount
to
be
desired
o
overall
a
great
beer
lots
of
malty
sweetness
an
a
pumpkin
pie
taste
if
you
think
a
pumpkin
beer
shuld
taste
like
the
pie
this
ones

up
there
in

go
this

out

one
should
be
avoided

elsewhere

initiates

most
discerning
critics
shouldnt
have
much
to
bicker
about
greatly
enjoyed
not
a
great
pumpkin
ale
but
not
terrible
ive
had
worse
ones
has
an
okay
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
slightly
subpar
body
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
against
other
pumpkin
ales
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
spiced
ale
it
keeps
its
ale
character
while
being
spiced
o
when
i
first
saw
that
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
pumpkins
in
it
i
thought
that
the
balance
might
be
off
but
the
beer
isnt
really
too
spicy
its
definitely
a
nice
beer
for
the
fall
especially
if
you
dont
want
something
thats
sweet
o
spicy
seasonal
choice
jawjacker
is
right
doubt
ill
be
able
to
taste
anything
after
this
one
i
do
think
there
is
an
issue
with
this
beer
that
was
not
intended
as
it
is
i
find
this
beer
to
have
belowaverage
drinkability
because
of
the
unbalance
it
really
needs
more
sweetness
the
spice
mixture
seems
to
contribute
the
right
flavors
to
the
beer
but
for
me
there
simply
isnt
enough
sweetness
to
make
it
work
properly
im
afraid
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
o
what
a
joke
good
job
at
making
a
cinnamon
beer
arcadia
i
like
how
you
added
that
faint
hint
of
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
poures
a
light
brown
body
with
no
head
but
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
well
balanced
of
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
some
clove
the
taste
is
the
same
asthe
smell
just
you
taste
the
spices
its
like
a
brown
ale
with
spices
add
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
ok
beer
so
theres
no
pumpkin
in
this
whatsoever
it
looks
like
nothing
on
the
bottle
or
6
pack
box
says
anything
about
pumpkin
being
in
this
weird
they
sure
make
it
look
like
theres
pumpkin
in
it

i
feel
ripped
off
wait
a
friend
bought
these
he
got
ripped
off
o
a
pretty
good
seasonal
beer
its
too
bubbly
for
my
tastes
but
it
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
so
its
worth
a
try
o
pretty
average
pumpkin
style
beer
for
having
no
pumpkin
in
it
just
average
not
a
bad
one
not
my
favorite
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
just
another
spiced
beer
for
fall
yes
this
is
too
strong
and
yes
this
is
too
spicy
nevertheless
i
liked
it
and
it
had
just
a
bit
of
a
toasted
nature
to
it
that
tied
everything
in
nicely
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
types
of
beers
this
was
sufficient
enough
to
enjoy
once
and
not
need
anything
afterward
to
wash
it
down
heck
i
could
even
have
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
with
this
overall
this
beer
was
not
so
bad
going
into
it
pretty
average
nothing
exactly
jumping
out
to
make
you
want
to
explore
the
whole
thing
i
may
try
this
again
but
not
exactly
willing
on
a
regular
basis
i
may
recommend
this
to
another
friend
cheers
taste
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
arcadias
done
a
fair
job
of
spicing
this
one
for
the
season
but
the
pumpkin
itself
is
sorely
missed
kind
of
tastes
and
to
segway
feels
like
a
spiced
octoberfest
considering
the
lightness
of
flavor
coupled
with
the
amberbrown
coloring
and
additional
ingredients
the
mouthfeel
is
too
viscous
this
beer
overall
is
worth
a
try
indeed
id
give
it
major
props
as
an
accessible
version
of
a
pumpkin
ale
but
in
the
end
it
leaves
me
reaching
into
the
fridge
for
a
darker
thicker
and
well
spookier
brew
thin
and
almost
flavorless
faintly
sweet
with
barely
noticeable
earthy
hop
presence
close
to
dead
carbonation
with
a
slight
syrupyness
finishes
with
a
hint
of
allspice
and
cinnamon
otherwise
a
palate
cleanser
drinks
like
water
yet
another
disappointing
pumpkin
beer
feels
medium
in
body
a
little
thirst
quenching
and
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
dirtysticky
o
a
good
example
of
an
english
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
somewhat
tannic
but
still
very
nice
no
i
would
not
recommed
this
beer
to
a
friend
overall
its
ok
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
for
an
autumnalpumpkin
beer
in
the
price
range
the
gritty
overspiced
feel
also
detracts
from
it
even
though
the
flavors
themselves
are
fine
enough
something
a
little
lighter
would
really
take
this
one
over
the
top
i
would
like
to
see
a
similar
malt
base
and
spice
profile
done
as
a
ciderlike
sour
this
looks
hazy
but
vibrant
in
the
glass
a
bright
bleached
cardboard
color
along
with
considerable
foam
the
foam
seems
consistent
with
the
arcadia
ales
ive
sampled
recently
and
despite
trying
a
pumpkin
ale
in
march
2012
it
appears
to
have
held
up
theres
a
noticeable
holiday
spice
on
the
aroma
nutmeg
allspice
some
clovewith
the
flavor
matching
the
aroma
the
spices
are
complemented
by
a
sharp
bittering
its
effervescent
very
light
on
the
palate
its
not
boozy
but
theres
a
boozy
mouthfeel
similar
to
that
from
bigger
beers
ive
sampled
although
this
brew
is
probably
half
a
year
old
its
still
tasty
light
to
medium
in
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
great
drinkable
give
it
a
try
once
for
the
experience
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
streaky
lacing
light
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
caramel
taste
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
light
spicy
yeast
pithy
and
a
bit
vegetal
even
though
there
isnt
actually
any
pumpkin
in
this
one
a
little
bit
bland
but
not
entirely
without
its
charm
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
moderately
drinkable
o
i
like
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
this
doesnt
rate
up
there
with
my
favorites
o
well
at
least
its
appropriately
named
not
awful
but
not
for
me
certainly
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
overall
not
much
of
a
pumpkin
beer
but
is
wellspiced
o
average
spiced
ale
good
but
not
great
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
believe
has
the
right
amount
of
spice
and
does
not
taste
like
an
oversweet
desert
beer
overall
having
recently
had
a
bottle
of
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
and
southern
tier
pumking
its
clear
that
this
beer
isnt
in
the
same
league
seems
like
they
cut
corners
or
something
pass
this
one
up
you
wont
miss
much
otastes
like
thanksgiving
said
waitress
and
it
didnt
disappoint
overall
this
beer
is
really
good
spices
up
front
with
a
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
pleasant
aroma
definitely
recommend
o
very
disappointing
brew
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
arcadias
cereal
killer
and
bought
this
hoping
it
would
follow
that
brews
reputation
for
quality
not
only
is
this
beer
subpar
it
purposefully
misleads
the
consumer
this
is
released
in
the
fall
and
has
a
pumpkin
on
the
label
with
no
accompanying
information
come
on
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
i
wish
i
wouldve
remembered
to
bring
my
phone
into
the
store
so
i
could
check
ba
and
avoid
this
garbage
i
guess
im
glad
i
tried
this
so
i
know
not
to
the
next
time
o
would
like
to
see
more
malt
backbone
to
this
dark
orange
amber
in
color
with
nothing
but
small
spots
of
white
froth
as
a
head
light
scent
mostly
seasonal
spices
like
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
oddly
placed
yet
solid
notes
of
lemony
citrus
lightly
caramely
sweet
and
faintly
musty
malt
profile
taste
a
little
better
than
scent
lead
on
still
not
overpowering
rather
standard
blend
of
spice
and
caramel
malt
with
again
a
quite
oddly
present
splash
of
lemony
hops
comes
across
as
lightly
watery
at
the
end
dry
finish
all
around
a
meh
beer
that
doesnt
do
much
wrong
it
just
lacks
in
most
categories
to
make
it
worth
while
if
you
see
it
id
pass
because
there
are
tons
of
better
examples
of
the
style
this
isnt
a
knock
on
arcadia
because
i
like
some
of
their
beers
but
this
is
a
complete
miss
although
it
couldve
been
worse
o
a
great
october
ale
or
something
to
remind
you
of
the
wonderful
smells
and
tastes
of
fall
i
love
the
picture
on
the
front
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
halloween
ale
quite
good
mouthfeel
and
overall
extremely
plain
and
flat
this
sort
of
tastes
like
water
with
spice
stirred
in
lightbodied
and
overall
a
bit
funky
tasting
this
beer
lacks
complexity
and
taste
one
of
the
most
disappointing
fall
beers
out
there
especially
in
the
spice
department
lightbodied
but
leaves
my
mouth
dry
i
had
this
a
year
ago
and
was
also
not
too
impressed
i
will
not
be
trying
this
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
spice
beer
the
smell
was
really
the
best
part
i
think
it
might
get
a
bad
wrap
because
they
sell
it
as
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
but
could
use
more
pumpkin
maybe
my
bottle
was
tame
but
spicing
wasnt
harsh
on
tap
at
the
hopcat
i
am
starting
to
find
pumpkin
beers
late
summer
this
one
had
significant
and
distinct
pumpkin
as
well
as
other
spices
to
enhance
drinkability
cloudy
yellow
with
some
lace
above
average
mouthfee
not
bad
and
cinammon
and
nutmeg
are
spices
i
like
mildly
spicy
aromas
overall
its
certainly
no
pumpkin
brew
but
it
sure
as
hell
smells
and
tastes
like
a
holiday
autumn
pie
which
is
pretty
nice
but
what
this
brew
is
missing
is
a
big
pumpkin
presence
to
help
even
out
all
of
those
spices
and
sharp
hop
flavors
on
the
end
arcadia
your
better
than
this
o
this
beer
is
not
to
be
confused
with
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
a
spiced
beer
and
should
be
reviewed
as
such
that
being
said
the
spicing
in
this
beer
is
a
little
overpowering
its
hard
to
taste
or
smell
anything
else
with
all
the
spicyness
going
on
here
this
is
the
most
uninspired
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
did
a
search
last
year
to
try
to
find
something
like
what
i
made
with
a
brewer
friend
of
mine
and
did
not
come
close
this
year
im
making
one
and
im
revisiting
my
study
the
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
too
much
bitterness
for
the
style
and
no
good
flavors
are
present
after
the
bitterness
attacks
your
tongue
the
color
is
fine
its
a
lighter
orange
color
and
the
aroma
promises
far
more
than
the
beer
delivers
too
much
alcoholbitterness
this
pumpkin
ale
poured
out
as
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
tan
fizzy
looking
head
the
lacing
is
not
really
noticeable
at
all
here
the
smell
had
some
spicy
pumpkin
aromas
with
some
light
clove
in
there
too
the
taste
was
pretty
light
to
me
there
wasnt
too
much
else
happening
here
the
mouthfeel
was
average
overall
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
wouldnt
have
to
buy
this
one
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brownishorange
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
cinnaimon
and
nutmeg
a
touch
of
pumpkin
taste
is
very
spicy
lots
of
cinnimon
some
nutmeg
a
tad
bitter
no
pumpkin
to
speak
of
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
being
a
bad
beer
i
feel
it
is
just
a
bit
over
spiced
d
i
am
certainly
enjoying
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
nice
to
have
a
beer
with
the
pumpkin
spices
without
the
sweetness
of
many
pumpkin
beers
very
refreshing
and
worth
a
try
ill
say
it
once
again
watch
out
for
arcadia
they
have
some
tasty
brews
moreys
bottom
line
its
not
horrible
but
why
not
have
the
pumpkin
i
know
there
are
no
rules
as
far
as
craft
beer
is
concerned
but
this
beer
seems
to
need
the
smoothness
of
the
pumpkin
in
a
big
way
d
never
again
i
would
give
this
to
friends
as
a
joke
beer
at
best
it
is
probably
the
worst
experience
ive
had
with
beer
as
of
yet
dmcrisp
and
clean
but
packs
a
subtle
punch
strong
flavors
that
blend
together
well
the
label
was
also
really
cool
which
misled
me
to
think
this
was
a
pumpkin
d
the
smell
and
taste
kill
it
im
not
sure
im
going
to
able
to
finish
and
its
not
sitting
well
with
my
stomach
at
all
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
d
again
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
surprised
not
everyone
feels
the
same
do
i
really
want
my
jaw
jacked
in
any
case
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
sunset
russetamber
topped
by
around
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
clove
and
blood
orange
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
orange
rind
light
caramel
and
that
applecinnamon
combination
you
find
in
cereals
and
turnovers
you
know
the
one
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
borders
on
the
dry
overall
a
nice
and
tasty
spiced
brew
nothing
earthshattering
but
definitely
enjoyable
this
beer
looks
a
slight
hazy
brown
orange
with
a
finger
of
puffy
white
foam
the
aroma
is
akin
to
apple
cider
or
perhaps
a
spicy
caramel
apple
there
seems
to
be
lots
of
cinnamon
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
nutmeg
and
clove
the
cinnamon
taste
is
even
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
and
the
green
apple
is
its
main
counterpart
when
mixed
with
the
caramel
malts
it
really
gives
that
fall
flavor
and
is
quite
nice
the
mouth
is
a
tad
too
watery
for
my
liking
but
be
cause
of
the
flavors
you
can
power
through
it
i
feel
its
quite
drinkable
there
really
isnt
anything
too
harsh
about
this
beer
pumpkin
spice
pass
avoid
the
bottle
at
all
costs
but
do
yourself
a
favor
and
stop
in
at
the
pub
to
have
this
on
tap
it
will
be
worth
it
poured
to
a
small
half
inch
head
head
was
gone
in
no
time
ale
itself
was
brown
in
color
no
lacing
at
all
had
a
strong
cinnamon
smell
also
smelled
of
nutmeg
also
notes
of
fruit
maybe
apple
didnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
smelled
i
thought
that
it
actually
didnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
maybe
a
slightly
sweet
apple
and
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
felt
okay
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
a
little
excessive
i
wont
buy
again
there
was
a
lack
in
flavor
almost
like
carbonated
water
d
an
impulse
buy
that
seemed
at
the
time
worth
a
stab
oh
how
helpful
some
wifi
would
have
been
as
fun
as
it
should
be
to
try
a
new
beer
with
seasonal
flair
like
this
wow
just
not
very
good
ive
had
other
arcadias
and
enjoyed
them
but
this
is
a
pass
if
the
opportunity
arose
again
from
the
pumpkin
patch
d
as
many
have
mentioned
there
may
some
false
advertising
going
on
here
the
label
depicts
a
scarecrow
with
a
huge
pumpkin
head
with
jagged
teeth
however
there
is
no
pumpkin
in
this
offering
its
all
spices
d
an
extremely
unpleasant
experience
and
drinking
the
entire
bottle
is
a
chore
a
beer
this
bad
deserves
a
15
in
the
drinkability
category
because
in
such
splendid
company
as
pumking
night
owl
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
why
bother
with
this
eric
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
wouldnt
get
a
case
of
this
but
it
is
worth
a
try
its
hard
to
get
past
the
spicing
here
bringing
in
the
buttery
tone
is
where
this
beer
loses
it
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
and
the
spicing
alone
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
us
if
youre
going
to
attempt
a
pumpkin
ale
do
it
right
notes
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
spectacular
liked
it
enough
that
i
would
buy
it
again
given
the
chance
but
not
so
great
that
i
would
have
it
on
hand
readily
at
all
times
d
i
pass
on
this
one
not
bad
but
not
great
it
does
not
utilize
the
flavors
very
well
very
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
or
season
but
solid
none
the
less
jaw
jacker
is
very
drinkable
with
no
real
offensive
qualities
worth
a
taste
taste
the
initial
taste
isnt
anything
special
there
are
noticeable
spices
but
not
too
strong
it
does
end
up
leaving
a
pumpkin
spice
aftertaste
that
is
pretty
good
pumpkin
ales
are
definitely
a
unique
breed
and
something
that
not
everyone
may
appreciate
but
this
one
is
well
balanced
and
i
think
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
if
youre
not
sure
try
at
least
a
bottle
or
a
6pack
jawjacker
is
worth
a
try
my
brother
recommended
this
to
me
in
a
sixtel
i
am
glad
he
did
this
draft
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
leaves
no
aftertaste
i
poured
it
in
a
chilled
glass
and
the
lines
to
my
beer
meister
were
brand
new
a
perfect
setup
for
a
good
fall
beer
cant
wait
to
get
home
tonight
and
have
another
this
is
a
truly
excellent
fall
beer
the
aroma
when
first
poured
reminds
one
of
a
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
upon
tasting
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
in
the
aroma
it
truly
has
that
pumpkin
pie
taste
hints
of
nutmeg
linger
on
your
tongue
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
at
all
heavy
and
refreshing
on
a
crisp
fall
day
drinks
alright
would
never
buy
another
sixer
of
this
when
i
can
get
ichabod
schaflys
pumpkin
brews
a
very
average
offering
the
spices
seem
the
lend
themselves
to
the
mouthfeel
as
well
giving
the
beer
an
unpleasant
powdery
chalky
quality
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
glass
starts
out
fairly
decent
but
goes
downhill
fast
very
disappointing
drinkability
interesting
decision
to
brew
a
pumpkin
ale
without
pumpkin
ultimately
it
is
missing
something
in
the
depth
of
flavor
beneath
the
spices
d
really
nice
drinkability
i
finished
my
glass
without
any
difficulty
whatsoever
4
5
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
orangelight
copper
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
disappears
very
fast
to
basically
nothing
leaves
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
predictable
pumpkin
and
spices
nothing
really
jumps
out
the
pumpkin
could
be
stronger
but
at
least
you
dont
have
to
look
for
it
the
taste
is
kind
of
bitter
right
away
its
followed
by
some
spices
and
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
the
pumpkin
isnt
really
as
noticeable
in
the
taste
which
is
kind
of
a
shame
the
spices
really
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
think
a
lover
abv
makes
this
one
pretty
drinkable
a
pretty
decent
fall
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
available
at
a
baron
draft
or
if
someone
had
one
for
me
two
thumbs
down
d
not
bad
but
not
awesome
the
medium
bodied
beer
feels
pretty
good
with
a
nice
creamy
quality
to
it
and
a
complimentary
amount
of
carbonation
but
the
spices
pretty
much
ruin
any
redeeming
qualities
the
beer
may
have
just
too
much
imo
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
am
not
overly
disappointed
with
my
purchase
purchased
a
6pack
from
big
z
beverage
in
huntington
ny
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
cooler
temperatures
leaves
changing
colors
and
homemade
pumpkin
pies
are
just
a
few
of
the
things
that
come
to
mind
when
i
take
a
whiff
of
this
beer
aromas
are
of
pumpkin
spices
and
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
way
it
smells
this
was
satisfying
and
i
will
have
no
problems
finishing
off
the
other
bottles
drinkability
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
this
one
is
average
at
best
too
heavy
on
the
spices
not
enough
pumpkin
coming
through
i
was
glad
i
could
try
this
one
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
in
a
hurry
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
the
future
d
nice
and
drinkable
id
say
its
more
drinkable
than
a
couple
other
pumpkin
ales
just
because
it
doesnt
have
so
much
overwhelming
spice
to
it
just
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
d
i
drank
four
of
these
the
other
night
i
have
no
idea
how
normally
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
taste
pretty
much
just
a
cinnamon
ale
the
other
spices
add
a
little
depth
and
complexity
but
the
spices
arent
in
balance
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
big
on
cinnamon
almost
like
big
red
with
some
nutmeg
and
allspice
to
give
that
pumpkin
pie
character
the
taste
is
quite
spicy
with
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
this
is
balanced
against
a
toasted
malt
which
is
a
bit
lemony
and
astringent
some
earthy
hops
round
out
the
profile
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
extremely
fizzy
with
a
lemony
astringency
a
decent
pumpkin
pie
style
brew
would
like
to
see
some
pumpkin
added
in
to
tone
down
the
spice
though
the
malt
does
cut
it
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
and
biting
refreshing
d
hearty
enough
for
cool
fall
evenings
but
light
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
good
seasonal
high
level
of
spices
may
be
a
turnoff
for
some
a
clear
deep
copper
color
body
with
a
two
finger
off
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
barley
and
pumpkin
pie
nice
amount
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
with
just
a
hint
of
baked
apple
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
nice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
notes
a
little
brown
bread
a
light
bitterness
and
citrus
finish
from
the
hops
medium
body
smooth
mouthfeel
a
good
drinker
for
a
style
that
is
not
my
favorite
the
beer
has
the
typical
seasonal
spices
such
as
pumpkin
nutmeg
allspice
the
beer
is
good
it
has
a
pumpkin
pie
like
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
in
the
finish
nothing
exceptional
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
herbal
beer
to
have
there
isnt
much
malty
base
here
more
the
spices
and
some
thinness
its
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
pumpkin
ale
thats
just
a
little
heavy
on
the
spicing
although
i
appreciate
that
they
were
able
to
keep
the
nutmeg
and
allspice
in
the
mix
where
cinnamon
usually
dominates
i
enjoyed
one
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
a
second
and
to
be
honest
although
i
quite
often
look
at
these
beers
as
possible
compliments
to
fall
and
winter
holiday
meals
i
think
id
only
go
for
this
one
merely
as
a
novelty
beer
at
halloween
well
maybe
with
some
sweet
yams
drinkability
fine
in
the
context
of
a
light
spiced
beer
i
guess
but
its
hard
to
refrain
from
letting
out
a
discontented
sigh
for
want
of
pumpkin
but
if
the
pumpkins
available
to
arcadia
are
anything
like
the
ones
featured
on
the
label
then
i
can
fully
understand
their
absence
and
omission
from
the
recipe
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
of
light
malts
with
some
adjunct
cereals
present
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
light
with
the
spices
dominating
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
good
as
the
spices
in
the
taste
are
not
over
powering
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
only
fair
as
it
is
under
carbonated
d
eh
this
one
is
way
overspiced
and
under
pumpkined
the
spices
can
get
very
annoying
and
distracting
if
you
dont
sip
this
very
slowly
so
that
puts
a
session
out
of
the
question
id
pass
on
this
one
next
time
d
an
ok
drinkability
overall
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
a
robust
taste
to
it
a
fairly
decent
beer
overall
arcadia

dense
brownish
orange
with
an
inital

the

like
what
i
would
imagine
the
breath
of
the
pumpkin
on
the
bottle
the

claims
to
have
spices
added
cinnamon
allspice

thats
kind
of

it

an
over
mix

spices

a
bitter
aftertaste
nasty
film
develepment
on
the
gums
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
nice
i
can
enjoy
it
up
till
the
point
i
start
to
taste
the
wicked
culmination
of
spices
feels
dense
like
it
looks
with
a
medium
sharp
carbonation
drinkability
is
worth
putting
one
bottle
in
a
pumpkin
beer
six
pack
mixer
and
only
for
comparison
six
packs
are
over
priced
and
would
not
be
advised
for
purchase
the
key
with
this
one
is
to
drink
very
slowly
so
as
to
catch
what
flavors
do
exisit
and
dont
plan
on
enjoying
it
as
much
as
you
might
have
liked
mouthfeeldrinkability
carbonated
to
the
point
of
being
tolerable
the
volume
and
resulting
burps
are
higher
than
expected
so
its
a
gassy
experience
in
the
belly
ones
enough
for
me
it
could
use
some
taming
with
regard
to
the
spices
i
have
had
this
a
couple
different
times
and
sometimes
it
has
been
great
and
other
times
it
has
been
slightly
off
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
but
it
is
a
good
spiced
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
break
away
from
the
usual
spiced
beer
it
is
quite
bitter
and
you
can
tell
there
is
a
british
influence
it
has
a
deep
bronze
almost
copper
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
the
body
there
is
a
tight
head
and
lace
it
has
a
strong
aroma
of
pumpkin
spice
and
hops
there
is
not
much
for
malt
but
there
is
a
strong
pumpkin
taste
it
is
medium
bodied
beer
notes
from

wow
why
would
a
brewer
put
out
something
like
this
glad
this
was
a
freebie
bottle
supplied
by
me
golfin
buddy
thats
diggin
the
craft
thanks
for
hooking
me
up
this
one
pours
a
orange
hue
with
nice
peach
highlights
the
cap
is
a
small
two
fingers
worth
of
smallmedium
and
large
bubbles
all
bursting
rapidlydeflating
away
to
nothingexcept
for
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
the
nose
is
greatly
understated
in
comparison
to
the
bold
and
spicy
flavors
within
i
smell
only
a
small
amount
of
spice
and
subtle
tangerine
the
flavors
are
not
overdone
keeping
this
one
away
from
some
of
the
artificiality
that
is
sometimes
standard
in
these
pumpkin
offerings
im
glad
that
arcadia
didnt
add
any
pumpkinit
helps
the
spice
to
build
off
of
the
malt
flavors
creating
a
pumpkin
pie
feel
without
taking
anything
away
from
the
natural
flavors
the
body
is
medium
to
thin
with
just
a
touch
of
slicknessthe
carbonation
is
on
the
high
endbut
acceptable
for
the
style
a
subtle
drying
aftertaste
and
slightly
sticky
fruitiness
lingers
for
a
moment
after
the
last
drop
is
gone
very
quaffablea
very
light
seasonal
and
a
bad
ass
name
theres
better
pumpkin
beer
out
there
and
i
just
learned
that
this
has
no
pumpkin
in
it
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
the
macro
beer
people
to
try
something
different
without
freaking
them
out
bring
it
to
a
halloween
party
for
the
cool
graphics
on
the
bottles
and
encourage
those
who
dont
normally
drink
beer
to
try
it
out
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
id
call
a
spiced
ale
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
mostly
clove
in
the
nose
with
some
faint
background
spice
all
of
which
warmedburnt
my
nose
vaguely
spicy
taste
tiny
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
di
wish
i
could
find
6
packls
of
this
one
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
more
d
this
is
a
drain
poor
for
me
i
have
too
much
good
beer
in
my
fridge
to
waste
my
sobriety
on
this
d
its
ok
as
far
as
fall
seasonals
go
drinkability
a
pumpkin
ale
of
last
resort
in
my
book
bottle
code
b3
still
a
good
beer
worth
the
purchase
poured
a
thickish
dark
coppery
with
a
slight
tinted
head
it
smelled
very
spicy
of
pumpkin
and
perhaps
cinnamon
it
seems
moderately
carbonated
and
has
a
decent
body
its
finish
is
greatvery
spiced
but
not
over
the
top
a
great
seasonal
and
another
great
beer
from
arcadia
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
overall
this
certainly
wasnt
bad
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
pumpkin
beers
an
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
festive
ale
here
a
good
representation
of
the
style
clear
amber
with
some
light
beige
foam
that
formed
a
ring
of
coarse
bubbles
with
a
fine
skim
covering
the
beer
some
shortlived
lace
very
spicy
aroma
aromatic
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
low
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
malt
but
mostly
spice
here
too
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
a
little
lemon
with
the
spice
lingering
in
the
finish
mediumlight
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
little
on
the
dry
side
this
was
ok
but
the
character
was
heavy
on
spice
and
thin
on
beer
this
poured
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
a
hazy
orangishamber
the
nutmeg
and
allspice
really
jumped
out
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
bracing
interplay
of
spices
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
more
of
a
cinnamon
flavor
than
i
had
experienced
on
the
tongue
but
it
still
had
a
lot
of
spice
lingering
after
the
swallow
it
was
decent
but
i
have
had
much
better
pumpkin
ales
and
probably
would
not
return
to
this
one
right
away
the
flavor
combination
sweet
pumpkin
pie
characteristics
and
hop
bittering
just
doesnt
work
well
together
for
me
seems
like
it
needs
to
tone
down
one
or
another
the
taste
has
lots
of
similar
flavors
a
solid
malt
beer
with
lots
of
spice
very
flavorful
but
without
being
cloying
or
artificial
tasting
lots
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
then
a
bit
of
clean
hop
bite
at
the
end
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
perfecly
spiced
and
flavored
like
pumpkin
pie
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
which
suits
the
style
this
is
one
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
to
enjoy
as
the
weather
turns
a
good
fall
or
even
a
winter
brew
mouthfeel
is
excellent
this
is
an
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
that
i
believe
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkable
now
through
the
new
year
appealing
dirty
orange
in
the
glass
smells
like
a
spice
rack
upfront
the
taste
is
quite
nice
but
an
outofplace
bitterness
forms
in
the
mouth
at
the
finish
to
support
the
level
of
spice
here
it
seems
that
some
additional
sweetness
is
necessary
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
albeit
a
little
strong
for
me
at
6
alcohol
a
little
less
of
a
percentage
would
make
this
beer
absolutely
super
otherwise
the
taste
smell
and
drinkability
are
topnotch
definitely
a
musttry
for
all
pumpkin
beer
fans
although
this
wouldnt
be
my
firstchoice
i
would
definitely
buy
a
sixpack
again
nice
amberorange
color
and
a
wonderful
autumnpumpkin
smell
packs
quite
a
punch
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
the
bottom
line
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
with
this
one
its
a
spicy
fall
pumpkin
pie
flavoured
beer
of
the
variety
this
is
a
good
example
though
and
i
have
rated
it
by
the
style
which
in
my
mind
is
weak
overall
i
like
a
good
spicy
beer
like
this
though
and
its
whetting
my
appetite
for
the
christmas
spiced
beers
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
something
id
pick
up
again
as
a
nice
fall
drinker
pours
a
deep
orange
smells
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
taste
follows
with
a
nice
spicy
bite
to
it
the
pumpkin
taste
is
present
and
finishes
a
little
more
bitterly
than
i
would
have
liked
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
sorta
prickly
on
the
tongue
not
much
creaminess
to
be
had
here
overall
its
a
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
ale
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
pack
update
this
one
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
a
sweet
hoppy
treat
but
still
not
very
pumpkiny
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fizzy
arcadia
beers
do
tend
to
be
a
little
over
carbonated
however
the
carbonation
does
create
a
creaminess
that
i
have
been
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
light
and
enjoyable
jawjacker
is
delicious
beer
the
trick
is
that
arcadia
has
brewed
a
pumpkin
ale
without
using
pumpkin
the
treat
is
the
quality
and
drinkability
of
the
final
product
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so
pick
up
a
sixer
i
now
wish
that
i
had
purchased
a
single
for
1
49
at
rudys
liquors
lasalle
il
the
aroma
had
me
thinking
that
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
flavor
though
while
not
utterly
discrediting
that
possibility
did
not
represent
nearly
as
well
this
dichotomy
winds
things
into
a
drinkable
but
not
overly
desirable
offering
i
wouldnt
say
no
out
of
hand
to
another
of
these
but
first
youd
have
to
prove
to
me
that
there
was
nothing
better
available
at
the
moment
im
not
sure
how
likely
that
is
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nice
spices
and
flavors
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
well
made
pumpkin
ale
the
spices
are
used
deftly
and
the
feel
is
great
i
prefer
a
skosh
less
clove
but
overall
a
very
balanced
and
quaffable
ale
it
has
session
qualities
w
pumpkin
and
spice
as
accentuation
of
a
very
good
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overly
lightfor
a
pumpkin
ale
on
the
palate
i
find
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
describe
it
its
almost
like
it
evaporates
once
one
starts
to
swallow
it
the
brew
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
and
is
lightly
carboanted
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
is
a
beer
one
could
easily
drink
all
night
and
even
though
it
is
somewhat
enjoyable
i
dont
think
that
id
want
to
specifically
drink
this
pumpkin
ale
all
night
there
are
others
that
id
much
rather
have
over
this
one
most
likely
will
never
buy
this
one
again
im
not
too
impressed
by
any
of
arcadias
brews
pours
a
golden
autumn
color
with
a
little
head
retention
but
not
much
the
nose
is
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
maybe
a
quick
whiff
of
alcohol
it
has
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
as
well
as
hints
of
a
wheat
ale
actually
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
wine
i
had
tried
a
year
or
so
ago
with
the
addition
of
fall
seasonal
spices
its
not
going
to
strike
you
as
a
wheat
ale
of
any
sort
but
when
considering
other
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
tried
it
seems
to
lean
in
that
direction
more
so
than
its
peers
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
fond
of
the
style
i
would
reccommend
trying
this
one
6
abv
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
but
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
appears
dark
amber
with
some
brown
tint
to
it
18
inch
very
thin
white
head
with
very
little
carbonation
bubbles
to
the
top
no
lacing
smells
primarily
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
spices
very
much
like
a
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
pumpkin
spices
and
some
breadiness
with
a
sweet
brown
sugar
pickup
as
the
beer
warms
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
little
carbonation
definitely
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
not
too
overwhelming
in
any
of
the
aspects
nicely
balanced
with
all
of
the
flavors
fantastic
for
a
fall
brew
slight
foggy
orangebrown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dies
down
quickly
to
a
solid
looking
film
of
fine
bubbles
no
lacing
nose
is
tons
of
nutmeg
aromas
some
roasted
malt
maybe
light
citrus
a
good
aroma
flavors
a
lot
like
gingerbread
cookies
definite
nutmeg
presence
giving
it
an
eggnoggy
sort
of
feel
as
well
nice
rough
bready
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
i
actually
liked
this
one
it
lacked
the
standard
arcadia
sourness
which
ive
grown
fairly
tired
of
i
think
its
my
favorite
from
them
overall
tough
to
find
by
me
but
buy
it
if
you
see
it
tasty
stuff
here
d
very
well
done
a
little
on
the
rich
side
but
this
has
replaced
ofallons
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
this
is
the
first
time
my
store
has
carried
this
brew
fall
seasonals
and
pumpkin
beers
come
few
and
far
between
until
this
year
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
with
only
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
and
does
not
seen
to
lace
down
at
all
actually
it
has
no
lacing
down
my
pint
i
have
had
a
few
other
pumpkin
brews
and
this
one
stands
out
great
warming
pumpkin
pie
and
nutmeg
smell
i
wonder
if
a
little
whip
cream
would
be
goodsnout
of
the
whip
cream
canister
in
the
beer
and
easy
does
it
this
beer
in
the
fall
around
a
fire
with
a
light
jacket
and
good
buddies
listening
to
great
rock
music
will
suit
my
needs
and
yours
too
drinkability
good
medium
bodied
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
solid
english
ale
base
complex
and
interesting
without
being
overbearing
this
is
a
world
class
pumpkin
ale
it
may
not
be
the
christmas
season
anymore
but
the
weathers
close
enough
for
me
not
to
care
too
much
right
now
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
midnight
ambertawny
topped
by
a
finger
of
pale
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
candied
orange
peel
light
cocoa
brown
sugar
cinnamon
caramel
allspice
ginger
and
a
touch
of
sweetbread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
caramel
drying
out
to
a
graham
crackerlike
situation
and
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
panoply
of
spices
in
play
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
tasty
spicy
brew
for
these
stillfrigid
times
deep
ambergold
color
with
small
head
and
average
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
nutmeg
and
other
dry
spice
taste
is
similar
with
a
mouthful
of
dry
spice
especially
nutmeg
alittle
too
much
feels
ok
on
thr
palate
and
definitely
has
an
alcohol
burn
overall
not
that
pleasant
of
a
beer
maybe
just
my
taste

spice
nutmeg
why
cant
i
give
a
numerical
value
poured
to
a

glass
nice
amber
color
with
a
1
inch

head
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
taste
of
dark
malt
coffee
and
finished
with
the
taste
of
honey
mild
mouth
feel
overall
a
good
choice
for
the
holidays
pours
a
reddishburnt
orange
in
color
with
a
halffinger
foamy
creamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
about
12mm
along
the
top
with
more
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
glass
in
small
spots
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
spices
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
the
mix
of
spices
cloves
hint
of
ginger
and
juniper
berries
with
some
orange
zest
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
love
the
mix
of
the
above
flavors
on
this
seasonal
brew
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
another
great
brew
from
schlafly
merry
christmas
overall
a
very
standard
christmas
ale
that
is
pretty
drinkable
for
me
though
i
prefer
something
a
bit
heartier
that
packs
a
bigger
punch
in
this
style
good
full
in
the
mouth
taste
beautiful
pour
and
colour
lots
of
winter
spiciness
and
warmness
glad
i

a

basically
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
but
with
christmas
spices
instead
of
the
pumpkin
medium
mouthfeel
smell
of
clove
ginger
brown
sugar
taste
is
more
like
the
smell
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
could
be
better
while
the
notes
are
well
done
theyre
not
as
strong
as
they
could
be
and
that
would
probably
improve
the
beer
however
the
beer
is
pretty
nice
and
i
would
recommend
getting
it
brownish
red
with
a
moderately
fizzy
head
this
beer
is
an
attractive
pour
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt

and
wood
full
flavor
well
balanced
and

o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
based
on
the
pumkin
ale
being
one
of
the
best
out
there
and
for
the
most
part
it
didnt
disappoint
looks
like
i
am
going
to
have
a
rdev
on
this
one
based
on
the
other
scores
i
think
it
could
do
without
the
orangecitrus
aspect
and
it
does
seem
slightly
boozy
for
what
it
is
however
it
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
that
i
would
likely
enjoy
again
if
i
wasnt
surrounded
by
great
lakes
and
thirsty
dog
better
than
their
pumpkin
ale
if
you
ask
me
delicious
spices
and
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
delicious
pretty
good
for
a
christmas
ale
at
8
you
really
dont
notice
it
still
prefer
other
christmas
ales
such
as
great
lakes
though
overall
good

really
well
made
even
if
it
isnt
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
quite
nice
i
have
a
low
tolerance
for
spices
in
beer
but
this
one
works
share
with
friends
on
a
cold
winter
night
fireplace
preferred
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
barely
there
slight
dry
finish
othis
a
great
beer
by
schlafly
for
the
winter
ale
o
disappointed
wanted
to
like
it
but
just
too
thin
add
some
robustness
and
you
have
my
vote
overall
a
good
christmas
beer
and
even
better
for
a
spiced
one
i
enjoy
it
and
would
gladly
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
solid
seasonal
choice
o
ok
spiced
winter
warmer
o
overall
good
christmas
ale
well
flavored
with
spices
and
fruit
notes
however
it
was
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
so
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
another
solid
offering
from
schlafly
nice
deep
mahogany
color
with
some
spice
and
sweet
molasses
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
beautiful
mix
of
christmas
spices
toffee
dried
fruits
and
a
hint
of
honey
a
light
bitterness
helps
balance
the
sweetness
a
nice
showing
from
schlafly
thank
you
kirk
for
the
beer
this
reminds
me
of
the
pumpkin
ale
to
an
extent
but
it
simply
doesnt
measure
up
in
the
thickness
and
robustness
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
has
lots
of
similarities
to
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
with
the
spices
frankly
this
pretty
much
taste
like
pumpkin
ale
without
the
pumpkin
and
maybe
a
hint
more
malt
overall
not
bad
at
all
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
of
the
top
5
christmas
ales
ive
had
before
if
only
it
were
a
little
less
sweet
id
really
like
it
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
o
nice
seasonal
offering
very
well
spiced
not
quite
balanced
enough
by
malt
and
other
flavors
doesnt
taste
of
an
8
0
abv
brew
taste
is
heavybodied
malty
and
spicy
with
a
slight
warmth
at
the
finish
a
perfectly
enjoyable
sipper
and
an
ideal
winter
warmer
overall
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
was
not
let
down
great
beer
to
have
by
a
warm
fire
to
celebrate
the
holidays
smooth
rolling
body
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
soapiness
on
the
front
end
creamy
and
big
finishes
with
a
pumpkin
pie
like
spice
flavor
much
like
their
pumpkin
ale
but
not
as
good
and
with
a
bit
of
a
drier
rather
than
sweet
flavor
good
with
deceptive
alcohol
but
its
similarities
to
schlafly
pumpkin
are
too
apparent
and
this
beer
just
isnt
as
good
as
the
pumpkin
maybe
i
will
take
from
winter
brews
for
a
while
o
i
thick
its
a
descent
christmas
brew
8
abvs
could
be
hidden
a
bit
more
burns
a
bit
more
than
i
wanted
missing
all
forms
of
lacing
solid
carmel
malt
i
would
buy
this
a
christmas
next
year
oa
nice
spiced
christmas
brew
a
good
one
not
the
best
but
good
o
definitely
gets
me
in
the
holiday
spirit
its
the
perfect
beer
to
consume
pre
or
post
holiday
shopping
but
next
year
i
just
need
to
remember
i
dont
shop
enough
to
buy
a
case
of
it
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
so
consider
that
before
you
bust
it
out
at
the
christmas
office
party
delicious
celebrate
the
holidays
properly
overall
very
nice
seasonal
brew
not
usually
a
fan
of
seasonal
beers
but
this
one
is
very
good
and
matches
well
with
the
season
a
cool
christmas
beer
a
drinker
not
a
novelty
the
pour
is
amber
to
red
darker
than
that
but
not
brown
at
all
mostly
clear
and
a
minimal
head
the
nose
is
really
boozy
but
juniper
and
cardamom
permeate
too
love
the
taste
of
this
complex
fruity
spicy
strong
and
as
drinkable
as
any
holiday
ale
or
winter
warmer
out
there
in
terms
of
subtle
and
not
dominant
or
aggressive
spice
notes
sour
fruit
up
front
sweet
finish
daring
but
approachable
at
the
same
time
body
is
thin
too
thin
really
it
lends
to
drinkability
but
it
makes
it
less
of
a
winter
warmer
in
the
classic
sense
its
carbonated
fine
but
its
just
a
tad
too
little
on
body
for
me
especially
given
how
alcoholic
this
is
better
and
better
as
it
warms
overall
an
exceptional
holiday
brew
a
must
try
at
the
taproom
o
overall
a
lot
of
spicy
xmas
nature
here
sweet
and
festive
and
blends
rather
nicely
together
it
is
what
it
is
a
xmas
beer
limit
of
one
is
fine
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
christmas
so
its
quite
fitting
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
copperbronze
color
with
a
good
amount
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
in
bands
all
the
way
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
cloves
nutmeg
cinnamon
caramel
malt
and
some
light
citrus
notes
the
flavors
were
very
enjoyable
to
me
i
tasted
all
the
aforementioned
spices
built
atop
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
with
only
light
hopping
which
gave
it
a
nice
finish
balanced
and
not
overly
spiced
as
many
holiday
ales
tend
to
be
additionally
there
was
almost
no
sign
that
the
beer
was
8
alc
and
i
didnt
realize
it
until
after
id
enjoyed
a
few
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
surprisingly
light
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
o
drinks
like
a
lesser
version
of
great
lakes
christmas
ale
its
a
spice
bomb
without
a
lot
of
complexity
or
character
goes
down
easy
like
sunday
morning
and
is
almost
as
forgettable
as
that
one
girl
you
hooked
up
with
in
college
after
20
games
of
beer
pong
its
certainly
not
bad
though
and
holds
its
own
with
most
of
the
entries
in
the
lets
drink
clove
and
call
it
a
christmas
ale
category
overall
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
beers
very
thick
and
warm
it
feels
like
the
holidays
o
good
beer
i
loved
the
pumpkin
ale
so
why
wouldnt
i
love
this
overall
the
time
has
improved
this
beer
a
bit
the
lack
of
alcohol
is
a
good
thing
the
spices
have
faded
a
bit
but
still
smooth
and
good
o
a
surprisingly
good
beer
that
avoids
being
overly
spiced
it
definitely
tastes
like
fall
and
winter
in
a
bottle
its
not
extremely
complex
but
still
enjoyable
overall
i
just
dont
like
the
sweetness
overload
on
top
of
the
high
alcohol
content
plus
the
spices
are
in
overdrive
so
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
much
all
the
way
around
this
might
be
the
last
schlafly
beer
i
ever
try
overall
this
wasnt
particularly
badtasting
but
the
aromas
meekness
and
bodys
lightness
make
this
a
bit
offputting
as
a
high
abv
winter
beer
overall
a
solid
christmas
beer
from
schlafly
love
this
brewery
d
nice
solid
winter
seasonal
flavors
are
balanced
and
appropriate
o
pretty
awesome
smelling
beer
alcohol
is
a
little
heavy
though
o
the
alcohol
is
blended
very
well
in
this
beer
but
it
loses
points
in
a
few
areas
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
light
it
is
also
on
the
sweeter
side
while
the
hops
are
there
the
sweetness
of
the
orange
combines
with
the
malt
to
create
a
beer
that
can
be
a
bit
of
a
toothache
the
warming
alcohol
at
the
end
does
help
but
the
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
sweet
and
sour
sauce
this
beer
screams
of
fruitcake
which
is
not
the
best
association
im
not
sure
that
i
would
drink
it
other
than
as
a
seasonal
or
with
special
events
but
im
really
impressed
and
i
think
that
it
would
make
a
great
afterdinner
beer
or
even
an
apertif
quite
nice
although
the
flavor
is
not
off
the
charts
nothing
offends
and
it
is
actually
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
there
is
no
real
notice
of
alcohol
i
will
enjoy
this
as
a
dessert
beer
during
the
holidays
and
think
it
will
be
a
good
fit
in
that
role
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
immediately
a
bit
cloying
but
as
it
sits
in
your
mouth
youre
able
to
begin
to
dissect
the
different
flavors
nice
beer
to
try
during
the
holidays
but
anything
beyond
a
12
oz
snifter
is
probably
more
than
enough
trying
the
schlafly
christmas
ale
this
evening
and
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
decent
the
scent
is
very
sweet
and
spicy
i
can
smell
cloves
cinnamon
orange
peel
and
some
ginger
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
but
the
clove
flavor
is
the
strongest
also
i
think
it
tastes
more
spicy
than
sweet
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
is
well
carbonated
overall
it
can
be
a
tough
beer
due
to
the
amount
of
spice
in
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
at
a
time
mouth
feel
is
not
very
carbonated
this
isnt
an
in
your
face
beer
it
reminds
me
of
some
barley
wines
without
the
strong
hops
easy
to
drink
with
hidden
alcohol
nothing
remarkable
though
a
drinkable
holiday
brew
but
nothing
exceptional
overall
a
sweet
spicy
and
warming
winter
beer
not
exceptional
but
definitely
above
average
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
of
the
wintersholiday
treats
that
are
available
overall
a
beer
that
does
not
start
out
very
promising
by
the
way
it
looks
and
smells
but
it
really
kicks
it
into
gear
on
the
palate
and
with
the
mouth
feel
the
best
holiday
ale
i
have
had
yet
poured
from
a
bottle
crystal
clear
and
deep
copper
color
smells
like
a
nice
christmas
ale
cloves
and
other
spices
tastes
like
a
bad
beer
gone
sour
and
tried
to
mask
the
flavor
with
spices
not
a
fan
of
this
one
has
a
slick
body
to
it
and
tastes
sour
at
the
end
of
the
taste
not
sure
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
or
what
overall
impression
not
an
easy
one
to
drink
i
would
say
you
could
have
your
12
ounces
of
this
and
then
can
call
it
a
night
more
of
a
night
cap
go
for
it
if
available
but
only
buy
a
6pack
of
this
if
your
with
5
other
guys
not
one
to
be
enjoyed
one
after
the
other
youll
see
what
i
mean
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
total
loss
but
the
richness
i
expected
for
a
big
winter
ale
wasnt
there
schalfly
let
the
additional
ingredients
do
too
much
of
the
work
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
czech
herbal
lliquor
becherovka
herbs
a
touch
of
liquourice
malts
a
little
sweet
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
its
interesting
but
not
something
i
love
and
as
i
drink
the
beer
i
like
it
less
and
less
i
dig
this
but
i
think
it
worth
mentioning
again
this
really
reminds
me
of
their
pumpkin
ale
good
beer
drink
it
the
aroma
is
a
very
big
blend
a
kitchen
since
or
spice
rack
if
you
will
as
i
am
picking
up
copious
notes
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
ample
apple
notes
brown
sugar
and
touches
of
light
citrus
at
first
you
would
not
think
this
would
work
but
hell
yeah
it
does
as
i
take
the
first
sip
i
am
struck
by
how
well
this
is
working
for
me
really
nicely
put
together
with
light
body
that
is
crisp
clean
and
does
wonders
for
keeping
the
large
amount
of
flavor
in
check
starts
with
a
healthy
dose
of
citrus
like
flavors
that
roll
into
a
spiced
brown
sugar
and
ends
with
a
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
led
charge
of
nice
spiced
holiday
like
flavor
overall
i
really
was
underwhelmed
by
this
one
sadly
enough
i
had
high
expectations
but
it
seems
to
succumb
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
again
if
i
find
it
on
tap
again
i
might
try
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
other
fall
ales
that
they
have
leftover
by
the
time
its
around
that
it
will
probably
get
washed
over
by
the
fall
leftovers
and
the
spring
releases
give
it
a
shot
though
if
you
find
it
not
anything
to
rearrange
your
life
over
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
there
was
a
big
frothy
head
on
it
that
took
a
little
while
to
recede
leaves
a
little
lacing
nice
aroma
a
little
lighter
but
definitely
christmas
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
taste
if
pretty
good
malt
clove
cinnamon
a
touch
of
orange
and
pine
this
is
actually
just
a
touch
bitter
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
start
lots
of
hops
to
balance
the
malts
a
decent
winter
beer
the
palate
opens
with
a
mild
medicinal
sweetness
along
with
a
blend
of
spices
and
herbs
again
this
really
is
like
potpourri
with
a
melange
of
flavors
present
pine
and
citrus
from
the
hops
an
herbal
character
that
i
cant
entirely
describe
and
a
blend
of
spices
with
clove
cinnamon
and
a
little
nutmeg
orange
peel
isnt
as
noticeable
here
for
some
reason
theres
a
bitterness
present
that
reminds
me
of
grains
of
paradise
for
some
reason
the
alcohol
is
rather
noticeable
even
when
cold
making
this
harsher
than
it
needs
to
be
the
booze
also
makes
this
more
noticeably
medicinal
which
isnt
entirely
appealing
medium
in
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
that
is
surprisingly
creamy
this
feels
decent
on
the
palate
mildly
bitter
and
mildly
herbal
on
the
finish
this
is
decent
ultimately
not
terribly
enjoyable
but
i
dont
regret
buying
a
single
md
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
quite
smooth
a
pretty
good
beer
but
had
high
hopes
after
trying
their
pumpkin
beer
in
the
fall
which
was
amazing
d
a
nice
spiced
winter
seasonal
beer
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
but
the
aroma
at
times
seemed
to
be
a
little
muted
the
abv
is
present
toward
the
ending
of
the
beer
but
only
for
a
second
or
two
would
love
to
try
this
stuff
again
i
think
a
little
fresher
bottle
will
do
this
beer
a
little
more
justice
schlaflys
christmas
ale
is
one
the
best
holiday
brews
ive
encountered
like
their
pumpkin
ale
they
really
know
how
to
walk
the
fine
between
too
little
and
too
much
this
is
so
well
balanced
and
it
makes
for
supremely
enjoyable
drinking
like
christmas
itself
ill
be
looking
forward
to
this
one
all
year
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
golden
amber
head
was
a
very
thin
off
white
that
didnt
last
at
all
in
fact
never
really
formed
aroma
was
a
tad
sweet
but
also
spicy
cloves
and
a
hint
of
citrus
as
well
taste
was
fruity
with
some
bubblegum
as
well
hint
of
hops
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
coated
well
but
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
a
different
take
on
a
winter
seasonal
that
was
a
very
solid
sipper
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
i
also
had
it
on
tap
once
in
a
bar
in
dc
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thinmoderate
linen
white
head
that
lasted
through
the
first
quarter
of
the
glass
and
left
partial
lace
pleasant
aroma
of
orange
peel
honey
and
cloves
subdued
holiay
spcies
decent
carbonation
the
flavor
is
mild
malt
with
stronger
orange
peel
honey
and
cloves
black
pepper
emerges
in
the
aftertaste
about
five
seconds
after
the
swallow
and
lingers
for
several
seconds
decent
drinkability
what
with
the
sweet
spiciness
and
the
alcohol
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
drinkability
a
nice
and
malty
holiday
treat
where
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
the
combination
of
spices
is
good
a
sipper
that
is
one
i
will
revisit
this
is
a
solid
winter
seasonal
seems
to
warm
with
each
sip
plenty
of
complex
and
interesting
flavors
that
blend
well
together
one
of
the
best
brews
yet
from
schlaflys
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
medium
copper
amber
color
with
a
slight
off
white
1
finger
head
the
aroma
is
a
a
muted
subtle
citrus
and
spice
of
cinnamon
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
flavorful
than
the
nose
with
a
sweet
gingerbread
like
start
along
with
sweet
citrus
fairly
malty
medium
mouthfeel
ends
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
the
booze
is
only
slightly
noticeable
ok
beer
spices
are
a
bit
much
they
really
clash
with
the
malt
kind
of
messy
pretty
good
beer
that
i
think
a
lot
of
folks
would
enjoy
but
not
something
that
i
would
typically
seek
out
medium
describes
the
body
and
carbonation
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
nicely
done
d
i
probably
wont
have
more
than
one
in
a
setting
i
think
it
loses
its
effect
after
one
but
definitely
worth
a
try
starts
off
spritzy
and
malty
it
transitions
into
white
peppery
spice
the
aftertaste
is
very
dry
and
the
alcohol
warms
the
throat
relatively
thin
body
but
this
may
be
from
the
high
carbonation
very
solid
brew
with
great
carbonation
its
well
made
and
simple
yet
some
nice
flavors
hidden
if
you
dig
deep
enough
a
perfect
christmas
brew
to
have
with
a
nice
turkey
dinner
enough
alcohol
to
get
you
a
warm
buzz
but
not
a
sipper
either
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
which
would
be
dangerous
given
the
8
abv
d
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
a
nice
one
to
try
glad
i
did
not
buy
a
six
pack
overallnotes
the
word
dependable
is
appropriate
ive
never
had
a
brew
from
this
company
that
floored
me
but
ive
also
never
had
one
that
disappointed
this
fits
just
in
that
mold
and
once
again
i
have
a
another
variety
of
beer
to
enjoy
worth
tasting
but
i
recommend
letting
it
warm
a
bit
if
you
dont
have
a
true
beer
fridge
or
cellar
like
me
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
basic
tumbler
glass
aroma
is
primarily
orange
and
clove
not
surprising
considered
those
spices
are
used
in
the
brewing
of
the
beer
first
taste
yields
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
followed
by
a
hefty
and
clear
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
heavy
handed
carbonation
keeps
things
from
getting
overpowered
graham
cracker
sweetness
starts
up
front
giving
way
to
a
cinnamon
bitterness
reminds
me
of
their
pumpkin
ale
though
with
a
slightly
different
spicing
regimin
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
id
go
with
the
pumpkin
though
this
certainly
isnt
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
high
alcohol
and
heavy
spicing
make
this
one
a
bit
tougher
to
drink
however
d
a
pretty
decent
spiced
beer
i
enjoyed
the
taste
a
little
more
than
the
smell
would
be
willing
to
try
again
verdict
really
excellent
and
wonderful
beer
worth
tracking
down
beer
is
light
in
body
and
sweet
at
the
lead
off
and
finishes
with
a
light
cinnamon
flavor
in
the
background
its
nice
not
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
but
a
drinkable
one
the
spices
arent
terrible
its
just
an
average
beer
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
pungent
and
the
mild
spices
are
fairly
tame
and
welldistributed
at
the
same
time
the
beer
is
completely
one
dimensional
and
im
not
sure
im
enjoying
that
dimension
all
that
much
light
cinnamon
and
some
ginger
are
what
i
pick
up
as
well
as
a
bit
of
light
malt
the
spicing
is
nice
on
the
medium
body
this
is
a
fairlydrinkable
winter
brew
but
its
not
all
that
special
in
the
end
mouth
feel
wise
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
to
make
this
lively
and
the
warming
feeling
in
the
end
is
faint
for
the
abv
content
which
is
a
plus
for
me
spicy
but
hard
to
place
a
finger
on
what
spice
they
might
have
used
d
although
this
is
april
this
is
still
drinkable
however
it
really
hits
the
spot
on
those
cold
winter
nights
as
the
8
can
warm
you
up
a
little
d
i
could
have
maybe
two
at
a
time
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
due
to
the
holiday
flavors
i
wouldnt
put
down
4
or
5
worth
the
money
for
sure
ive
had
better
examples
of
this
style
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
next
year
maybe
a
little
fresher
or
on
tap
md
another
great
brew
from
schlafly
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
that
carried
the
right
amounts
of
citrus
and
sweet
blended
well
with
spices
but
over
done
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
end
but
doesnt
ruin
the
experience
a
great
seasonal
from
schlafly
that
comes
highly
recommended
the
spice
and
sweet
malty
character
of
this
beer
hide
the
fact
its
8
abv
i
had
to
consciously
pace
myself
when
drinking
this
six
pack
as
the
inviting
aromas
and
solid
flavor
keep
you
comin
back
for
more
schlafly
rarely
makes
beer
that
wows
me
and
while
christmas
ale
doesnt
wow
me
its
better
than
a
good
many
schlafly
offerings
ive
enjoyed
this
is
a
solid
rather
enjoyable
christmas
ale
that
should
please
and
deserves
a
spot
in
many
a
fridge
over
the
holidays
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
11122009
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
decent
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
spicy
i
can
smell
cloves
cinnamon
orange
peel
and
some
ginger
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
but
the
clove
flavor
is
the
strongest
also
i
think
it
tastes
more
spicy
than
sweet
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
is
well
hidden
however
due
to
the
amount
of
spice
in
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
at
a
time
with
that
being
said
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
and
ill
have
to
pick
some
more
up
next
year
drinkability
for
a
beer
8abv
i
sure
drank
it
fast
drinkability
i
give
it
a
3
because
its
not
awful
but
i
would
certainly
never
seek
it
out
doesnt
really
compete
with
the
likes
of
a
bells
christmas
ale
or
the
hoppin
frog
frosted
frog
bye
drinkability
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
during
the
holidays
and
i
have
no
problem
with
that
whatsoever
although
slightly
overpowering
and
for
that
reason
i
like
to
mix
it
up
with
other
styles
this
also
helps
with
the
abv
level
of
this
beer
which
if
youre
not
careful
can
take
you
by
surprise
not
the
most
unique
beer
in
this
general
style
nor
the
most
flavorful
but
i
am
favorably
impressed
i
havent
had
a
beer
i
liked
less
than
this
in
a
while
and
i
could
easily
pour
it
down
the
drain
but
ill
finish
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
beer
without
much
flavor
and
a
thin
body
this
might
be
for
you
all
in
all
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
d
this
is
a
tasty
little
beer
its
one
that
you
could
have
one
or
two
but
not
sessionable
a
nice
beer
here
says
its
brewed
with
orange
peel
and
cloves
beautiful
color
nice
head
on
it
too
clove
definitely
comes
through
in
the
nose
along
with
some
cinnamon
ginger
and
something
slightly
metallic
thats
offputting
the
taste
follows
almost
exactly
big
gingerbread
clove
and
spiced
notes
metallic
taste
returns
though
mf
is
medium
bodied
not
bad
coating
a
decent
winter
beer
to
enjoy
and
warm
up
with
overall
25
through
this
one
im
not
overly
impressed
it
seems
just
a
bit
too
cloying
for
8

abv
schlafly
doesnt
disappoint
with
its
christmas
ale
probably
the
most
fruity
of
all
the
christmas
ales
i
have
had
this
is
one
almost
anybody
could
enjoy
a
sipper
for
sure
this
would
be
terrific
with
some
gingerbread
or
fruitcake

nice
seasonal
effort

no

some

is
smooth

crisp
with
an

overall
drinkeable
but
a
little
lacking
in

d
moderate
to
low
drinkability
in
my
mind
the
abv
on
this
beer
would
sneak
up
on
you
big
time
the
spicy
edge
makes
it
a
nice
after

thanks
tim
md
nice
tasting
brew
for
the
holidays
but
a
bit
too
sweet
or
clovey
for
my
tastes
very
spicy
hints
of
cinnamon
clove
and
maybe
some
allspice
mouthfeel
was
average
or
above
average
for
a
schlafley
as
was
the
drinkability
maybe
if
it
had
been
a
little
warmer
in
more
of
a
snifter
or
tulip
style
glass
i
might
have
enjoyed
it
more
this
beer
poured
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
3
inch
white
head
that
left
some
seriously
sticky
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
really
spicy
clove
nutmeg
a
hint
of
cinnamon
a
just
a
bit
of
orange
zest
are
apparent
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
what
seems
like
my
wifes
hole
spice
cabinet
thrown
in
clove
and
nutmeg
are
definitely
the
most
prevalent
flavors
with
orange
zest
date
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
a
bit
creamier
then
what
i
expected
absolutely
fabulous
this
is
a
good
beer
and
im
proud
to
call
schlafly
a
local
brewery
mouth
is
thick
oily
and
very
candylike
medium
carbonation
and
easily
drinkable
way
to
go
schlafly
the
lacing
follows
the
beer
with
each
sip
this
is
my
4th
or
5th
schlaflys
and
im
still
waiting
for
one
thats
not
exceptional
this
may
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
its
potent
at
8
alcohol
but
its
terribly
smooth
so
its
highly
drinkable
its
a
shame
its
a
seasonal
brew
conclusion
not
a
bad
winter
beer
and
i
like
the
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
hops
a
lot
of
spiced
beers
seem
to
have
little
to
no
real
hop
presence
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
spices
are
just
a
little
overwhelming
for
this
to
be
truly
great
drinks
easy
nice
mix
of
flavors
here
cheers
merry
christmas
my
favorite
christmaswinter
ale
so
far
this
year
and
lucky
me
that
its
readily
available
everywhere
i
go
i
am
a
newer
person
to
the
craft
beer
population
but
schlafly
still
has
not
disappointed
me
and
this
one
raised
the
bar
for
the
next
drinkability
is
high
for
a
beer
clocking
in
at
8
i
might
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
in
anticipation
of
the
ensuing
holidays
i
really
didnt
like
schlaflys
pumpkin
spice
offering
but
their
christmas
ale
is
the
shit
d
not
bad
a
nice
take
on
the
xmas
offering
d
id
drink
it
a
ton
if
it
werent
for
the
price
tag
i
paid
10
50
for
a
sixer
but
it
does
appear
to
be
worth
it
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
holiday
ale
on
the
evenings
following
this
review
i
also
got
a
nice
sappy
piney
hop
presence
subtle
and
a
biscuity
malt
note
thanks
pmcadamis
and
happy
holidays
d
a
good
sipper
for
a
cold
holiday
season
night
its
33
degrees
and
wet
here
in
central
illinois
the
perfect
time
for
a
spicy
and
boozy
winter
ale
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
not
as
glorious
as
i
expected
from
a
special
release
beer
from
schlalfly
i
do
like
the
sn
celebration
like
take
on
a
winter
brew
now
to
pick
up
some
2008
bottle
from
party
source
this
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
light
beige
head
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
citrus
peel
coriander
and
sweet
cookies
lightbodied
with
a
sweet
spiced
character
flavors
of
clove
caramel
malt
and
mild
hops
the
finish
is
citrusy
with
a
lingering
sweet
spice
aftertaste
slightly
above
average
overall
d
probably
my
favorite
holiday
offering
sadly
ill
have
to
wait
until
near
next
december
for
more
of
these
very
delicious
and
very
affordable
not
an
every
day
refreshing
drinkernot
spiced
for
that
but
id
enjoy
it
fairly
often
this
is
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
on
the
regular
d
excellent
beer
i
think
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
next
holiday
season
shlaflys
special
offerings
usually
fare
well
but
its
the
standard
beers
that
sometimes
fall
short
the
experience
with
this
beer
leads
to
a
wonderful
light
spicy
flavor
but
with
a
lesser
body
opens
with
a
bright
copper
orange
hue
with
great
clarity
initial
head
formation
that
lacked
staying
power
spicy
aromas
of
curraco
clove
and
giner
dominate
the
modest
malt
profile
flavors
bring
more
than
just
a
hint
of
these
spices
but
allowing
a
smooth
caramel
malt
flavor
to
balance
and
smoothen
somewhat
dry
and
thin
in
the
textures
leading
to
a
crisp
grahmcracker
finish
very
nice
drinkable
beer
but
a
more
round
body
would
have
helped
d
amazingly
approachable
for
8
youll
probably
guess
a
theme
touch
too
much
clove
for
me
candied
sugared
malt
backbone
is
supported
with
a
bold
spiciness
that
is
not
overdone
again
orange
peel
being
the
most
prominate
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
sipper
and
im
suprised
to
look
up
and
see
that
its
8
abv
as
i
dont
detect
any
alcohol
d
very
good
beer
one
of
the
better
holiday
offerings
i
have
tried
pours
a
cloudy
red
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
has
a
bunch
of
malt
and
cloves
the
flavor
has
a
bunch
of
clove
in
it
and
a
touch
of
bitter
orange
the
malt
presence
is
strong
but
the
spices
overpower
somewhat
the
body
is
nice
but
im
still
not
crazy
about
this
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
christmas
beer
understated
spices
a
nice
orange
flavor
and
enough
bitterness
to
make
it
very
palatable
d
maybe
im
just
in
the
holiday
spirit
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
warmersholiday
beers
ive
had
this
season
it
isnt
too
sweet
or
spiced
and
allows
hops
to
shine
through
i
could
just
be
a
homer
but
this
and
boulevards
nutcracker
ale
have
really
hit
the
spot
this
winter
pours
a
somewhat
murky
rich
amber
hue
with
a
pillowy
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
frothy
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
decent
bits
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
candy
cane
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
gingerbread
good
variety
of
smells
but
they
seem
a
bit
artificial
malty
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
of
fresh
spices
and
clove
with
a
pumkin
like
taste
what
i
do
enjoy
about
the
flavor
is
that
its
not
overaggressive
like
many
spiced
beers
are
subtle
hop
and
malt
balance
but
theyre
a
bit
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
powerful
carbonation
i
was
hoping
this
one
would
be
a
bit
smoother
in
the
mouth
i
didnt
even
check
the
abv
until
about
half
way
through
the
tasting
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
8
bort11
gave
me
two
of
these
one
to
try
now
and
one
to
cellar
lets
see
what
this
one
is
like
in
about
year
thanks
again
tim
pours
a
gorgous
and
lively
amber
red
color
and
produces
a
nice
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
beer
is
just
slightly
hazy
but
very
rich
in
color
this
beer
just
looks
good
spotty
lacing
is
left
inside
the
large
snifter
im
using
for
this
beer
the
nose
is
the
holidays
in
a
glass
strong
aromas
of
holiday
spices
cloves
cinnamon
and
citrus
behind
the
spicy
notes
is
a
very
pleasant
roasted
malt
character
smells
festive
in
every
way
the
palate
doesnt
disappoint
either
spices
up
front
intermixed
with
aggressive
floral
hops
and
dominant
citrus
notes
bitter
orange
peel
mostly
due
to
the
liberal
use
of
hops
in
this
beer
you
get
an
over
all
dry
taste
with
a
lot
going
on
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
finish
is
very
herbal
and
citric
without
being
medicinal
or
cloying
at
all
beautifully
crafted
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
very
fluid
the
8
abv
is
wellmasked
in
my
opinion
but
opens
up
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
i
believe
this
to
be
one
of
my
very
favorite
christmas
beers
its
very
well
balanced
incredibly
tasty
te
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
spiced
christmas
beer
that
is
quite
enjoyable
its
the
type
of
beer
id
hit
up
for
a
and
a
nice
departure
from
the
typical
winter
warmer
for
me
the
citrus
and
bold
hop
presence
makes
this
beer
these
characteristics
could
well
be
why
some
wont
like
this
beer
but
its
what
makes
it
stand
out
of
the
crown
for
me
absolutely
excellent
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
schlafly
this
year
and
thats
saying
a
lot
d
this
was
a
really
good
beer
it
is
probably
the
best
herbedspiced
brew
that
ive
ever
had
drinkability
a
great
seasonal
ale
good
fireside
brew
let
it
warm
up
a
little
to
let
the
flavors
shine
thanks
hopsaplenty
drinkability
is
for
me
not
great
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
lots
of
no
notice
of
the
8
at
all
very
well
hidden
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
sending
this
one
my
way
i
am
a
winterspiced
beer
fan
to
an
extent
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
i
would
drink
a
few
if
available
locally
i
was
saving
this
for
a
special
occasion
and
i
think
i
found
one
as
this
evening
my
wife
and
i
went
for
a
six
mile
walk
in
15
below
temperatures
on
the
coldest
day
of
the
winter
thus
far
here
in
northern
minnesota
and
witnessed
comet
mcnaught
just
because
we
could
gotta
love
rural
living
clear
burnished
amber
short
persistent
head
of
loose
small
tan
bubbles
punctuated
by
steady
columns
of
carbonation
the
head
falls
to
a
thin
skim
leaving
a
few
spots
of
foam
sweet
orange
and
spicy
clove
aromas
are
brushed
with
the
smallest
hint
of
spicy
hops
orange
peel
more
fleshy
than
rind
meshes
with
a
strong
clove
presence
that
finishes
with
more
cloves
lingering
a
long
while
there
is
a
modest
amount
of
toasty
malt
but
it
is
dominated
by
cloves
and
orange
medium
body
that
feels
thin
at
times
the
carbonation
is
fine
bubbles
relatively
singular
in
its
spice
focus
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
wider
flavor
range
and
a
slightly
bulked
up
body
dark
bright
amber
with
a
thin
sheet
of
white
lacing
that
combs

streaky

sweet
piney

freshly
baked
apple

cloves
gingerbread

all
in

up
for
a
great
first
impression

about
a
full

props
to
schlafly

marketing
this
as
a
winter
ale

to
look
forward
to
each
year

a
light
popourri
ample
spicing
but
not
over
the
top
taste
is
just
what
the
label
indicates
a
zesty
citrus
cut
with
clove
again
moderate
amounts
here
not
falling
for
the
overdo
that
many
spiced
beers
do
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
relative
easy
drinkability
not
the
worlds
biggest
spiced
beer
fan
but
this
one
pulls
it
off
rather
well
pretty
interesting
interpretation
of
a
winter
warmer
i
like
the
spiciness
and
the
clean
bite
added
by
the
hops
good
brew
schlafly
for
folks
who
have
criticized
this
beer
for
having
a
lot
of
spice
that
is
like
criticizing
an
ipa
for
having
a
lot
of
hops
thanks
to
jpm30
vancer
for
this
festive
holiday
brew
prosit
mk
it
was
not
too
good
i
didnt
think
it
was
as
bad
as
some
others
aforbes
did
but
the
taste
pretty
much
kills
this
beer
it
pours
a
deep
clear
red
brown
looks
ok
so
far
smells
like
christmas
piney
nutmeg
cloves
not
bad
the
taste
is
overload
of
ginger
nutmeg
cloves
orange
pine
pretty
much
tastes
like
a
christmas
air
freshener
in
beer
form
on
the
plus
side
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
errr
coveredup
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
bit
dry
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
taste
but
i
bet
if
you
simmered
this
stuff
on
the
stove
it
would
make
your
house
smell
really
good
ive
been
to
schlaflys
i
know
they
make
good
beer
i
also
know
that
this
is
not
one
of
the
ones
that
i
like
yeah
i
know
its
a
christmas
ale
and
i
know
that
some
people
like
to
put
some
spices
in
their
christmas
drinks
but
come
on
guys
this
was
just
they
dumped
in
a
bunch
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
and
orange
rind
and
figured
that
if
you
could
taste
all
of
that
crap
in
the
beer
it
would
make
it
a
good
beer
ive
all
for
those
flavors
in
beer
now
dont
get
me
wrong
but
to
the
extent
that
they
were
all
right
up
there
hitting
me
in
the
tongue
and
it
was
so
muddled
and
unbalanced
its
the
worst
tasting
spiced
beer
ive
had
since
that
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
from
2
yeaers
ago
way
too
many
spices
and
it
was
a
bit
thin
too
looked
ok
and
actually
smelled
fine
but
yeah
downhill
from
there
a
very
well
done
winter
warmer
tasty
and
interesting
but
with
all
the
spices
i
doubt
i
could
finish
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
it
would
be
nice
after
shovling
snow
or
just
for
holiday
enjoyment
mediumfull
bodied
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
but
better
for
sipping
a
little
heavy
on
spices
for
pairing
with
most
food
but
should
be
nice
after
dinner
12

poured
into

a
long
day

eating

very
strong
and

a
slightly
bitter
hardwood
flavor
with
various
spices
mingling
around
the
edges
more
of
the
cloves
a
bit
of
nutmeg
finishes
with
some
hop
notes
even
though
it
is
8
it
doesnt
feel
as
warm
as
some
other
winter
warmers
that
are
lower
in
abv
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
one
i
will
enjoy
this
holiday
season
i
think
this
one
is
better
suited
for
after
dinner
rather
witht
he
meal
thanks
ric
d
because
of
the
huge
spice
note
and
the
little
odds
and
ends
that
i
had
trouble
appreciating
i
would
put
my
personal
limit
at
two
with
this
brew
it
does
hop
bite
just
a
tad
too
strong
a
couple
more
malt
seeds
would
have
worked
wonders
oh
well
it
may
be
8
but
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
long
although
slowly
hats
off
to
steve
hale
and
the
rest
of
the
schlafly
brewers
overall
i
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
good
easy
to
drink
with
nice
holiday
spiciness
that
is
balanced
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
i
could
drink
many
of
these
im
sure
nicely
done
edited
for
spelling
errors
nice

nicely
i
had
this
earlier
in
the
week
and
i
like
it
better
now
i
couldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
isnt
bad
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
ng
beers
are
just
not
my
style
o
im
normally
not
a
big

was

the

the
upfront
wheat
came
as
a
shocker
after
a
while
all
i
could
taste
was
the
wheat
seems
to
be
the
same
weizen
yeast
used
in
dancing
man
wheat
not
a
fan
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
pretty
well
done
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it

i
would
gladly

it
if
it
was

stickyness

is

toward
a
waxy

by
the

the

and
flaccid
the
bones
are

but
the

isnt
could
use
a
touch
more

and
a
little
vanilla
sweetness
to
round
things
out
as
it
is
its
merely
good
its
an

everything
about
this
beer
from
nose
to

its
exactly
as
advertised
it
leaves
me
craving
whipped
cream
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
but
its
quite
enjoyable
overall
an
okay
beer
i
like
it
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
it
is
lacking
a
certain
beer
like
quality
overall
a
pretty
good
german

on
a

though
no

plenty
of

with
a
nice

unique
and
something
different
that
separates
itself
from
many
current
pumpkin
beers
the
first
2
bottles
out
of
the
6er
i
bought
were
more
spicy
than
pumpkin
actually
didnt
really
taste
pumpkin
in
either
one
that
being
said
i
enjoyed
the
hefe
style
of
the
beer
with
the
added
spice
very
drinkable
good
beer
overall
certainly
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
not
sure
im
in
love
with
it
but
at
least
it
is
different
i
could
certainly
use
a
lot
more
pumpkin
and
spices
it
was
nice
to
have
a
pumpkin
beer
brewed
as
as
a
hefeweizen
i
do
wish
the
taste
was
more
pumpkiney
overall
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
but
the
bright
citrusy
flavor
throws
of
the
balance
of
what
wed
expect
to
be
a
smooth
wheatforward
pie
spice
finish
not
bad
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
weve
had
final
score

awesome
that
ng
finally
came
out
with
a
pumpkin
beer
and
did
a
great
job
on
it
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
cloudy
orangish
brown
it
is
a
partwheat
beer
and
brewed
using
weisen
yeast
so
it
is
supposed
to
be
cloudy
nifty
lacing
the
spices
are
there
heaviest
on
the
nutmeg
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
the
style
is
almost
perfect
for
a
pumpkin
beer
which
imho
does
not
benefit
from
a
crisp
lager
treatment
not
very
sweet
but
this
aids
in
the
drinkability
department
i
sure
as
hell
hope
they
bring
this
back
in
future
yearsill
certainly
be
enjoying
it
while
it
lasts
this
season
spicy
aroma
dark
brown
hazy
body
sweet
tasting
has
some
spice
as
well
actually
a
little
tangy
sort
of
like
pumpkin
pie
ive
had
better
and
worse
this
is
average
o
new
glarus
first
pumpkin
beer
long
has
it
been
anticipated
and
instead
of
going
the
normal
route
theyve
carved
out
a
brand
new
path
in
the
world
of
pumpkin
beers
a
pumpkin
weiss
ive
yet
to
experience
one
even
the
pumpkin
beer
connoisseur
i
am
pumpkin
pie
lusts
aroma
is
immediately
different
and
hard
to
pinpoint
with
both
pie
spices
and
weiss
yeast
being
used
in
conjunction
but
this
beer
has
a
great
malt
profile
that
carries
through
the
flavor
into
the
soft
feel
making
it
a
unique
and
quite
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
foamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
rich
with
pumpkin
and
spices
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
rich
with
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
delicious
and
wellmade
this
one
smells
amazing
the
flavor
is
okay
above
average
and
the
body
is
thin
good
enough
to
get
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
bier
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
beer
due
to
the
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
in
the
past
this
one
tastes
great
and
should
be
given
the
credit
it
deserves
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
want
a
pumpkin
beer
that
is
too
in
your
face
with
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
i
could
have
used
just
a
little
bit
more
from
this
one
also
the
appearance
was
very
cloudy
which
reminded
me
of
a
homebrew
that
doesnt
have
proper
clarity
better
than
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
it
is
very
fruit
forward
and
almost
creamy
in
the
mouth
not
bitter
or
abrasive
but
most
notes
of
cinnamon
cardamon
and
clove
are
hidden
deep
within
this

crystal
clear
and
with
no
appreciable
head
smells
like
the
aforementioned
molasses
cookies
tastes
like
a
highly
carbonated
version
of
the
same
actual
ginger
flavor
here
is
to
my
palate
too
washed
out
like
all
too
much
bad
gingerbread
and
unfortunately
this
beer
hasnt
got
much
else
going
for
it
midgrade
overgassed
molasses
cookie
beer
this
brew
is
pretty
tame
and
subtle
it
is
not
a
good
value
and
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
o
its
what
you
might
expect
from
a
gingerbread
stout
minus
the
roasty
flavors
its
pretty
good
but
it
would
likely
benefit
from
the
admixture
of
roasted
malt
o
good
but
may
improve
with
a
little
aging
im
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
thats
what
this
beer
reminded
me
of
since
gingerbread
and
pumpkin
spice
contain
some
of
the
same
spices
in
actuality
this
beer
didnt
remind
me
enough
gingerbread
i
did
enjoy
the
lightness
of
the
beer
but
if
it
was
a
bit
creamier
or
had
more
of
a
ginger
flavor
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
better
d
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
great
flavors
good
abv
perfect
for
the
season
well
worth
looking
for
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
massive
head
that
laces
and
retains
very
well
nose
is
like
a
weak
porter
with
ginger
added
some
hint
of
dark
malts
is
present
but
very
subdued
the
body
barely
makes
it
past
the
light
category
very
well
carbonated
which
helps
bring
forth
what
flavor
is
there
like
the
nose
dark
malt
flavor
is
subdued
resulting
in
a
profile
that
is
mostly
ginger
while
not
overpowering
it
is
rather
mild
the
ginger
needs
to
be
balanced
with
a
background
malt
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
somewhat
crisp
with
a
residual
weak
ginger
astringency
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
be
improved
upon
o
not
bad
but
not
great
i
love
anything
gingerbread
so
i
thought
this
would
be
my
new
favorite
beer
but
i
honestly
didnt
taste
anything
resembling
gingerbread
if
youre
on
the
fence
about
trying
this
id
say
to
pass
i
couldnt
even
finish
my
bottle
which
is
rare
it
wasnt
the
worst
and
if
raul
could
compliment
it
it
actually
tasted
similar
and
a
bit
better
than
newcastle
but
unlike
katy
perry
this
thing
didnt
make
raul
roooooooar
the
taste
what
there
is
comes
across
as
bland
with
a
minor
trickle
of
apple
and
bubble
gum
that
is
stalked
by
a
shallow
spot
of
malt
one
that
is
either
lost
or
unqualified
for
a
real
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
cross
between
being
harsh
and
spectacurlarly
underwhelming
bison
brewing
what
did
the
bison
ever
do
to
you
this
beer
was
terrible
watery
and
flavourless
this
is
the
2nd
bison
organic
beer
ive
had
and
theyve
both
been
awful
this
is
a
drain
pour
glad
i
only
got
1
bottle
the
taste
is
pretty
much
nonexistant
i
dont
taste
ginger
cinnamon
malt
nutmeg
or
even
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
i
tried
from
bison
i
would
be
reluctant
to
buy
another
decent
brew
i
like
the
addition
of
the
ginger
cinnamon
and
other
holiday
spices
overall
this
beer
is
very
well
put
together
it
was
interesting
to
try
its
basically
like
a
winter
warmer
ale
with
a
twist
interesting
concept
i
could
only
drink
one
and
feel
like
i
didnt
eat
a
big
ol
plate
of
cookies
though
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
although
it
turned
out
to
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
it
tastes
kind
of
like
a
pumpkin
beer
without
the
pumpkin
so
if
that
sounds
like
what
you
are
looking
for
then
it
may
be
worth
a
try
o
ok
but
not
as
tasty
as
i
was
hoping
for
pass
on
this
one
bison
gingerbread
ale
pours
brown
with
next
to
no
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
holiday
spices
with
ginger
taking
the
forefront
the
taste
well
the
taste
doesnt
just
quite
work
i
taste
the
porter
base
and
i
taste
the
spices
but
they
never
come
together
at
all
instead
its
like
taking
a
swig
of
ginger
beer
sprinkling
a
little
nutmeg
in
and
chasing
it
with
the
most
generic
porter
body
imaginable
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
watery
and
the
drinkability
is
alright
overall
bisons
gingerbread
ale
is
just
a
slightly
below
average
beer
its
drinkable
but
never
really
reaches
enjoyable
had
this
at
the
parkway
tavern
in
tacoma
dark
garnet
mahogany
in
color
with
a
whitish
head
slightly
spicy
aromatics
ginger
does
seem
to
be
prevalent
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
other
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
perhaps
malty
and
medium
bodied
not
bad
not
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
as
with
many
herbal
andor
spiced
beers
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
without
getting
sick
of
it
o
a
decent
porter
with
a
holiday
touch
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
holiday
spices
and
dark
roasted
malts
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malts
up
front
with
some
sweetness
and
the
spices
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
if
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
little
holiday
porter
that
is
worth
a
try
a
good
holiday
beer
that
i
will
be
drinking
again
good
taste
i
like
this
overall
not
worth
getting
and
very
disappointed
since
this
has
been
on
my
tick
list
for
a
while
not
very
gingerbread
tasting
at
all
just
a
spiced
weak
porter
overall
decent
but
nothing
to
rave
about
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
were
offered
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
holiday
beer
and
really
thought
it
was
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
i
like
the
addition
of
the
gingerbread
spices
and
think
it
really
hits
on
that
flavor
profile
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
not
finding
the
gingerbread
in
here
but
other
flavors
bopping
around
in
there
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
mild
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
spices
coming
through
as
more
earthy
than
sweet
there
is
a
mild
roasty
and
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
more
earthy
than
i
was
expecting
o
its
not
like
i
didnt
enjoy
this
onei
guess
i
cant
complain
too
much
then
its
no
gingerbread
beer
but
it
sure
satisfied
my
roastloving
taste
buds
the
ginger
in
this
one
edges
very
close
to
becoming
overbearing
i
could
use
more
roast
to
back
it
up
good
idea
but
something
was
missed
in
the
execution
o
smooth
and
drinkable
spiced
beer
if
only
it
is
slightly
cheaper
flipping
through
the
pages
of
the
local
brew
pub
and
the
synopsis
of
this
bison
gingerbread
ale
caught
my
eye
now
it
being
after
valentines
day
i
was
still
ready
to
pucker
up
to
this
spicy
note
driven
brew
wow
the
smell
was
incredible
my
partner
drinking
with
me
had
three
separate
sips
from
the
glass
we
were
sharing
before
i
was
ready
to
relieve
my
nose
from
the
empty
bottle
then
i
had
my
first
sip
initially
the
mouthfeel
was
christmas
time
all
over
again
but
within
seconds
i
had
snapped
out
of
my
flashback
my
scores
reflect
my
excitement
as
i
watched
the
ale
being
poured
and
then
handed
the
bottle
my
overall
score
is
my
confusion
of
how
fast
that
taste
was
gone
luckily
ever
sip
it
comes
back
but
at
5
50
a
12
oz
bottle
i
am
just
glad
i
tried
it
medium
bodied
this
beer
would
have
served
well
on
xmas
eve
waiting
for
santa
to
come
down
the
chimney
that
is
if
he
got
by
the
blazing
stove
overall
a
nice
beer
the
organic
label
scares
me
more
than
attracts
me
but
this
comes
off
with
just
a
hint
of
rain
water
and
unwashed
tin
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
but
the
acrid
malt
flavor
is
offputting
im
not
a
ginger
fan
so
not
my
fave
but
o
its
ok
and
above
average
but
not
as
gingerbreadginger
snap
forward
as
i
would
like
plus
the
finish
is
disjointed
and
a
little
unpleasant
watery
bitterness
washes
away
all
of
the
good
aspects
of
the
beer
d
this
was
not
that
great
of
a
beer
with
the
ginger
character
not
mixing
well
with
the
porter
base
the
body
was
pretty
weak
too
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
very
enjoyable
either
not
recommended
tastesoft
flavors
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
gingerbread
rather
thinbodied
and
seems
to
go
flat
in
a
hurry
more
of
everything
would
greatly
help
things
out
here
decent
at
best
maybe
for
washing
down
some
real
gingerbread
cookies
i
poured
this
interesting
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
nearly
black
and
poured
a
really
nice
tan
colored
head
the
smell
was
spicy
and
so
was
the
taste
definitely
could
taste
the
ginger
and
other
holiday
spices
in
this
one
but
it
was
not
so
strong
that
is
blowed
you
away
i
would
buy
again
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
a
dark
body
with
reddish
hues
the
aroma
is
of
light
ginger
bread
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
the
tasting
left
much
to
be
desired
this
ed
a
very
watered
down
beer
with
malt
and
mild
gingerbread
notes
kind
of
disappointing
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
expected
a
lot
more
out
of
this
beer
but
it
is
organic
so
taking
that
into
consideration
i
must
rate
it
as
such
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
pleasant
experience
only
to
be
disappointed
this
beer
is
overspiced
for
my
liking
i
keep
trying
to
imagine
gingerbread
but
i
cant
make
that
stretch
mainly
a
decent
porter
with
a
ton
of
spice
smell
and
a
touch
of
spice
once
it
hits
your
mouth
not
a
bad
choice
to
pair
with
the
hedonistic
inhaling
of
freshly
baked
holiday
cookies
ointeresting
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
anything
fun
to
drink
but
im
not
about
to
buy
any
more
overall
not
bad
but
i
think
that
4
calling
birds
as
far
as
being
a
beer
brewed
with
gingerbread
is
obviously
the
superior
offering
i
like
the
creativity
though
and
i
can
get
behind
bisons
intentions
of
being
all
organic
so
i
am
not
opposed
to
drinking
it
again
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
if
its
available
and
the
price
is
still
right
it
will
make
its
way
to
my
fridge
again
drinkability
my
first
bottle
of
this
i
didnt
care
much
for
tonight
after
baking
up
several
dozen
gingerbread
cookies
i
took
another
crack
at
it
and
liked
it
much
better
could
use
more
breadiness
it
doesnt
hit
me
as
a
full
on
gingerbread
beer
but
its
got
enought
to
merit
some
holiday
props
nice
job
bison
light
body
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
not
as
interesting
as
it
sounds
disappointing
o
this
beer
is
disappointing
because
it
could
be
a
great
winter
beer
bison
should
really
take
a
step
back
and
rework
it
maybe
try
an
imperial
version
overall
drinkable
but
not
as
interesting
as
the
concept
tastes
wonderful
at
first
like
youre
biting
into
a
gingerbread
man
just
about
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
mixed
with
surprisingly
strong
nodes
of
burny
ginger
but
then
the
spice
nodes
just
drop
away
as
if
into
the
aether
and
are
replaced
with
a
rather
generic
heavily
malty
beeriness
the
break
is
disconcerting
and
the
back
end
really
drags
down
the
front
bison
gingerbread
if
you
put
it
on
the
label
it
shoudl
taste
like
it
low
aromas
low
ginger
flavor
but
there
dark
brown
ale
we
had
a
large
xmas
beer
tasting
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
when
you
put
gingerbread
on
the
label
you
should
make
that
noticeale
overall
its
not
for
me
appears
a
deep
dark
almost
black
hue
with
some
mahogany
brown
highlights
coming
through
the
dark
color
of
the
body
this
beer
has
head
forms
thick
foaming
khaki
tan
head
forms
fine
even
lacing
as
it
dwindles
down
aroma
is
super
spiced
especially
after
finishing
an
anchor
osa
with
the
subtle
spice
this
one
is
really
popping
with
christmas
spices
nutmeg
ginger
allspice
cinnamon
with
caramelized
sugars
and
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
malts
flavor
is
really
harsh
with
spices
dark
roasts
and
a
slightly
burnt
roasted
malt
coffee
accent
it
clashes
with
the
base
beer
which
is
an
organic
porter
wtih
my
next
few
sips
im
starting
to
adjust
with
the
high
level
of
spices
and
dark
roasted
malts
minimal
herbal
hops
are
masked
by
those
spice
additions
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
finishes
super
dry
with
the
bitterness
from
the
spice
additions
overall
a
decent
christmas
beer
experience
im
glad
i
just
picked
up
a
bottle
good
in
small
quantities
definitely
a
specialty
holiday
ale
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
does
have
the
promised
gingerbread
effect
but
i
would
like
it
to
be
sweeter
with
a
bit
bigger
body
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
great
one
of
those
beers
that
if
its
cheap
enough
i
could
drink
it
all
the
time
o
this
beer
had
a
great
aroma
but
was
let
down
by
a
lackluster
taste
and
feel
with
some
work
in
these
aspects
this
beer
could
be
quite
good
as
it
is
right
now
it
is
just
slightly
above
average
final
notes
a
solid
runofthemill
porter
its
slightly
spiced
but
i
dont
think
quite
enough
to
consider
it
a
spiced
beer
i
did
enjoy
it
but
would
have
liked
some
more
kick
the
aroma
was
far
too
light
to
be
really
noticeable
lots
of
citrus
hops
here
and
a
nice
touch
of
light
spices
mostly
pepper
but
again
it
was
just
not
strong
enough
to
really
set
itself
apart
from
anything
the
flavor
again
was
light
spices
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pepper
all
mingling
about
very
light
feel
here
now
as
the
flavors
were
all
gone
far
too
quickly
pours
a
clear
very
dark
reddish
brown
almost
black
in
color
smells
unsuprisingly
like
gingerbread
cookies
taste
is
sweet
dough
up
front
followed
by
a
little
caramel
and
ginger
and
finishing
with
a
citrusy
chocolate
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavor
while
good
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
awhile
as
the
beer
sticks
to
the
back
of
your
tongue
an
interesting
beer
nonetheless
d
the
novelty
of
a
beer
that
tastes
this
much
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
makes
this
an
anticipated
seasonal
d
nice
holiday
beer
from
bomc
something
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
definitely
worth
a
buy
next
holiday
season
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
nice
gingerbread
quality
to
it
but
also
has
a
nice
balance
this
was
far
better
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
i
definitely
was
able
to
detect
some
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
allspice
on
the
first
whiff
with
bready
ginger
notes
that
really
make
seem
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
but
in
liquid
form
the
taste
was
a
little
light
on
the
pumkin
spices
and
cinnamon
but
had
gingerbread
man
cookie
notes
and
brown
sugar
accents
really
intresting
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
bready
slight
spice
and
mild
toasty
finish
it
drank
decent
but
it
definitely
a
novelty
beer
that
was
quite
intresting
i
would
one
day
try
to
pair
it
alongside
some
gingerbread
cookies
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
one
ive
had
several
bottles
before
reviewing
it
just
to
be
sure
im
giving
it
a
fair
shot
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
supergingerbready
brew
kind
of
the
st
creme
brulee
of
the
gingerbread
flavors
but
it
just
kinda
fell
flat
to
an

the
only
thing
positive
about
my
disappointing
drinking
experience
was
that
this
beer
is
actually
very
good
once
i
got
past
the
frustration
of
it
not
tasting
anything
like
the
way
the
label
said
it
would
its
a
smooth
somewhat
robust
stout
and
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
it
is
not
gingerbread
ale
dont
let
them
fool
you
buy
their
chocolate
stout
instead
dont
waste
your
time
on
this
d
this
is
quite
a
treat
it
really
delivers
on
the
promised
flavors
its
truly
a
complimentary
blend
between
the
porter
and
ginger
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
though
enjoy
it
after
meal
this
is
a
decent
holiday
beer
smells
malty
with
gingerbread
molasses
and
chocolate
notes
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
moderate
tan
head
spicy
with
a
mild
hop
presence
finishes
with
gingerbread
not
as
strong
throughout
as
i
would
have
liked
not
overly
sweet
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
definitely
fun
for
the
holidays
but
i
have
had
better
seasonal
brews
a
very
appropriate
for
the
holidays
brew
that
arrived
via
botmc
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
waft
of
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
pours
to
a
deep
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
medium
size
bubble
head
on
the
taste
it
starts
off
with
some
metallic
hops
followed
quickly
by
a
sweet
malt
then
the
spices
kick
in
bigtime
lots
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
bold
but
not
overbearing
finishes
relatively
clean
with
a
bit
of
lingering
tangy
bite
ac
of
6
8
not
detectable
in
the
least
mouthfeel
is
average
not
overly
carbonated
nor
thin
but
nothing
you
could
stand
a
spoon
in
a
good
holiday
brew
good
for
the
cooler
days
gets
you
in
the
holiday
spirit
good
not
exceptional
verdict
very
good
and
wellpriced
make
it
worth
tracking
down
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
is
medium
full
i
really
did
not
get
any
traditional
ginger
bread
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
a
cardamom
note
the
beer
is
descent
and
fairly
easy
to
finish
off
the
flavor
has
a
bit
more
depth
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
some
light
cinnamon
and
ginger
and
a
very
mild
chocolate
character
the
feel
is
a
tad
bit
light
with
low
carbonation
it
drinks
easy
enough
though
its
not
terribly
tasty
and
is
a
bit
bland
i
believe
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
so
i
probably
wont
be
purchasing
this
again
at
least
until
next
year
my
girlfriend
is
a
vegan
so
she
really
likes
the
fact
that
buffalo
bills
has
a
good
amount
of
organic
beers
she
could
drink
this
beer
all
year
long
as
she
stated
drinkability
yeah
even
one
of
these
is
a
chore
honestly
it
is
a
good
novelty
beer
to
be
honest
and
actually
does
it
well
however
it
is
a
bit
much
to
be
truthful
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
am
saving
one
for
when
my
parents
visit
and
will
have
them
try
it
with
me
to
see
their
reactions
not
horrible
at
all
upon
first
sip
i
was
greeted
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
molasses
my
cheeks
puckered
a
little
bit
to
the
taste
and
thought
that
it
was
probably
a
good
representation
of
a
gingerbread
beer
i
think
i
was
probably
hoping
for
more
of
a
pumpkin
spice
beer
but
after
two
bottles
think
that
those
who
like
molasses
would
enjoy
this
beer
probably
wont
buy
anymore
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
not
a
bad
offering
but
more
maltyness
is
required
d
i
would
never
drink
this
again
nor
would
i
recommend
this
to
a
friend
i
feel
like
it
was
an
amateur
beer
experiment
gone
very
very
wrong
this
bottle
has
been
around
a
while
on
sale
in
pacific
beach
for
3
99four
surprisingly
pleasant
stuff
let
it
warm
up
from
fridge
temp
just
a
little
and
it
is
actually
a
decent
beer
better
than
some
of
the
recent
anchor
christmas
ales
in
a
similar
style
drinkability
a
bit
reminiscent
of
anchors
osa
though
somewhat
tamer
just
as
their
chocolate
stout
gets
the
job
done
being
a
chocolaty
stout
so
too
does
the
gingerbread
ale
at
being
a
spicy
porter
i
try
to
go
organic
for
a
lot
of
things
i
eat
and
drink
but
this
is
probably
the
first
organic
beer
ive
tried
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
too
hoppy
not
bitter
it
was
a
good
flavor
but
speaking
of
flavor
where
was
the
gingerbread
it
seemed
more
like
a
light
oatmeal
stout
i
love
gingerbread
but
i
did
not
taste
it
in
this
i
will
try
something
else
from
bison
next
time
my
girlfriend
likes
the
chocolate
stout
by
them
this
porter
is
easily
drinkable
and
a
nice
variation
on
the
style
keeping
up
a
nice
balancing
act
while
managing
to
become
a
perfect
beer
for
the
holiday
season
its
possible
the
ice
cream
pairing
enhanced
my
experience
with
bisons
gingerbread
ale
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
pan
out
but
it
has
turned
out
for
the
better
this
is
a
bison
product
i
would
surely
do
again
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
overspiced
aroma
with
in
order
of
intensity
nutmeg
ginger
and
cinnamon
theres
also
this
slight
offnote
that
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
rotten
pumpkin
melting
plastic
its
very
minor
but
its
there
flavor
is
watery
porter
with
the
expected
gingerbread
character
dominating
doesnt
taste
artificial
but
its
just
too
much
for
me
its
like
on
christmas
if
someone
makes
gingerbread
cookies
and
you
eat
like
12
of
them
and
then
you
never
want
to
taste
gingerbread
again
thats
how
i
feel
three
quarters
of
the
way
through
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
bitter
with
roastiness
but
theres
a
significant
astringency
also
cloyingness
detracts
from
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
black
body
with
brown
hues
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
a
rather
soft
pour
produces
a
thin
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
aroma
is
roasted
barley
bread
along
with
ginger
and
some
cinnamon
the
first
sip
imparts
a
roasted
coffee
like
bitterness
from
the
malt
bill
along
with
plenty
of
ginger
spice
the
experience
is
almost
like
taking
a
bit
of
a
gingerbread
cookie
then
having
a
sip
of
a
cold
dark
coffee
the
carbonation
is
ample
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
bodied
i
would
not
want
to
have
too
many
of
these
but
it
is
a
nice
little
nod
to
gingerbread
of
all
the
christmasholidaywinter
spiced
beers
this
one
probably
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
much
better
than
most
drinkability
i
liked
it
but
i
dont
know
how
much
of
the
cinnamonnutmeg
taste
i
could
stand
it
is
quite
delicious
though
for
1
or
2
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
id
readily
drink
again
poured
a
thick
black
hue
with
good
head
on
top
of
a
sharp
ginger
smell
with
hints
of
cinnamon
caramel
and
bready
sweet
malts
with
no
real
hop
presence
the
body
is
mediumtofull
and
a
little
sticky
but
maintain
a
bready
ginger
spice
feel
although
isnt
completely
natural
and
not
as
smooth
as
i
wouldve
hoped
not
as
chewey
as
slushy
and
finishes
with
a
dry
backbite
that
reminded
me
of
faint
bitter
chocolate
or
toffee
a
good
beer
but
just
seemed
like
it
couldve
been
better
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
decent
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
ginger
and
sweet
caramel
malts
with
slight
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
ginger
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
very
reminiscent
of
a
gingerbread
cookie
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
beers
from
bison
ive
had
yet
i
love
gingerbread
love
it
like
cherries
i
can
have
it
in
almost
any
form
bread
cookie
candy
ice
cream
pretzel
the
list
goes
on
so
when
i
saw
the
beer
i
was
like
yeah
im
gonna
drink
that
awesome
we
poured
it
cold
and
as
it
warmed
up
the
gingerbread
aroma
started
to
come
out
and
it
had
this
great
deep
red
color
very
vibrant
actually
thin
head
but
ehn
whatevs
but
i
ended
up
being
disappointed
the
aroma
was
say
from
1
to
10
a
1
when
we
opened
the
bottle
because
it
was
cold
and
then
it
warmed
up
to
about
a
3
maybe
a
4
but
then
it
just
stopped
bitch
is
near
room
temperature
and
you
have
to
swirl
her
and
put
half
your
face
in
the
glass
to
get
the
scent
boo
more
hop
than
gingerbread
basically
if
you
like
ipas
and
gingerbread
but
like
ipa
more
by
several
degrees
then
its
for
you
if
you
think
its
going
to
be
like
gingerbread
in
the
form
of
beer
no
no
you
are
wrong
d
tasty
flavor
experience
and
a
nice
compliment
for
the
season
i
give
props
to
bison
for
the
adventurous
style
of
melding
gingerbread
and
beer
together
i
think
it
works
drinkablity
is
so
so
at
best
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
a
miss
just
doesnt
hit
the
dark
ginger
and
sweet
flavors
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
real
good
one
either
pass
a
much
darker
appearance
than
i
had
anticipated
a
very
slight
amount
of
ginger
in
the
nose
but
not
much
at
all
more
malt
than
ginger
in
the
nose
taste
is
malty
and
spicy
with
very
subtle
ginger
the
carbonation
really
promotes
a
very
complex
mouthfeel
which
is
particularly
tasty
overall
a
very
impressive
and
unique
seasonal
drinkability
perfect
accompaniment
to
any
winter
christmastime
activity
unique
as
it
really
does
taste
like
gingerbread
even
after
the
novelty
factor
wears
off
it
still
comes
through
as
a
very
solid
beer
try
if
you
get
the
chance
plus
its
organic
if
that
means
anything
to
you

the
slightest

surprisingly

i

it
in

june
is

its
pretty
darn
good
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
tight
fluffy
beige
head
that
kept
form
well
for
quite
some
time
ginger
is
the
main
element
in
the
nose
wich
is
expected
along
with
some
earth
and
brown
sugara
little
thin
and
sharp
in
the
mouth
but
it
mellows
after
a
bit
a
good
mix
of
spice
and
earth
on
the
palatethe
ginger
doesnt
overpower
but
is
the
main
attractionther
is
a
solid
dry
earthiness
in
the
finish
bison
makes
some
decent
organic
beers
and
this
is
no
different
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
wiith
the
spices
done
at
just
the
right
level
worth
seeking
out
and
enough
to
show
me
that
organic
doesnt
always
mean
subpar
d
first
i
have
had
from
bison
and
would
recommend
it
similar
to
anchor
xmas
style
but
not
as
crisp
as
theirs
still
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
fair
this
is
a
unique
winter
beer
with
great
spice
profile
there
is
a
bit
of
a
disconnect
between
the
aroma
and
taste
gingerbread
lower
than
expected
chocolate
higher
than
expected
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
but
the
spices
make
it
hard
to
finish
even
the
whole
22oz
bottle
good
recommendation
from
the
guys
on
craft
beer
radio
podcast
but
i
doubt
ill
be
craving
this
any
time
soon
d
an
interesting
beer
one
of
the
more
heavily
spiced
winter
beers
out
there
on
the
market
would
go
great
with
pumpkin
pie
or
a
holiday
meal
a
tasty
beer
from

bottling
has
held
up
reasonably
well
despite
the
oxidation
with
a
bigger

this
could
be
really
interesting
this
brew
seems
to
have
some
root

there

i
am
not

person

this
was
real
nice
continued
gingerbread
notes
with
light
coffee
and
maybe
a
sprinkling
of
some
dark
cocoa
powder
added
sweetness
reduces
almost
all
of
the
bitterness
and
makes
for
an
incredibly
smooth
experience
recommended
thanks
to
nathan15
for
the
bottle
d
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
certainly
not
something
to
sit
around
and
drink
all
night
i
would
much
rather
have
a
balanced
traditional
porter
or
an
anchor
christmas
ale
if
this
is
the
style
i
want
to
taste
very
interesting
spiced
holiday
brew
to
be
sure
and
an
edit
does
coca
cola
use
ginger
in
their
soda
this
beer
just
keeps
on
reminding
me
of
that
flavor
profile
now
ill
have
to
try
bisons
chocolate
stout
which
ive
purposely
been
avoiding
for
some
time
this
poured

dark
dark

with

very
cool
effervescent
bubbles
make

to
the
top
before
dissipating
the
smell
is
er
gingerbread
with
cinnamony
spices
and
a
malty
character
very
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
that
i
enjoyed
this
seems
more
like
a
dark
lager
than
an
ale
but
a
very
good
one
at
that
makes
an
excellent
changeofpace
if
you
want
to
sample
something
new
this
is
a
mohaganycolored
beer
with
a
huge
chocolatecolored
head
maintained
by
vigorous
carbonation
smells
are
very
light
and
prettymuch
smells
like
a
molasses
cookie
with
a
wisp
of
english
hop
in
the
background
ginger
taste
takes
the
forefront
backed
by
cidery
tastes
of
light
molasses
and
brown
sugar
along
with
a
light
roasted
character
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacks
robustness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
i
have
no
specific
complaints
but
didnt
find
this
beer
that
drinkable
i
think
as
much
as
i
like
it
other
places
ginger
is
a
little
offputting
to
me
as
a
beer
ingredient
this
is
a
decent
holiday
brew
i
do
enjoy
the
gingerbread
flavors
i
havent
had
too
many
gingerbread
beers
but
overall
this
beer
can
definitely
hold
its
own
its
a
fun
and
festive
beer
that
tastes
good
too
recommended
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
up
at
first
i
was
mildly
repulsed
but
the
acidity
decreased
and
more
the
nutmeg
came
out
as
it
warmed
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
incredibly
thick
foamy
head
quite
resilient
too
nose
is
the
best
part
for
mefull
of
ginger
flavor
is
like
ginger
bread
at
first
it
was
stale
cookies
but
as
it
got
closer
to
room
temperature
more
of
breadlike
flavor
came
out
just
a
tad
acidic
medium
mouthfeel
and
just
a
tad
sticky
alright
after
it
warmed
after
having
a
few
standard
bison
brews
i
didnt
hold
out
much
hope
for
this
brew
glad
i
made
the
purchase
its
good
beer
begins
with
a
maltiness
that
id
expect
from
sweeter
english
and
scottish
ales
but
with
a
serious
ginger
addition
doesnt
really
come
across
a
gingerbread
but
with
a
fresh
ginger
addition
the
malts
pick
up
on
a
doughy
yeasty
flare
but
not
rounded
with
the
nutmeg
cinnemon
or
allspice
doesnt
have
to
the
beer
is
well
bodied
sweet
characterful
and
balanced
well
with
english
hops
lingers
a
bit
too
long
with
the
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
graininess
late
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
of
this
season
the
smell
is
unique
and
appealing
with
plenty
of
gingerbread
flavor
vanilla
comes
through
too
the
taste
also
has
a
lot
of
gingerbread
but
it
doesnt
come
out
as
well
malt
content
seems
minimal
it
is
pretty
light
in
the
mouth
last
swigs
this
seemed
like
agood
beer
right
in
the
heart
of
christmas
season
intersting
beer
to
say
the
least
a
well
done
novelty
that
is
worth
trying
basically
a
gingerbread
porter
great
head
with
strong
retention
atop
a
smokey
thick
brown
great
smokey
malts
mixed
with
a
much
more
authentic
gingerbread
aroma
than
expected
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
overpowering
the
taste
reflects
the
great
balance
of
a
good
porter
and
the
gingerbread
the
roasty
and
smokey
blend
very
well
would
have
gotten
a
five
in
that
department
except
for
the
fact
that
it
lost
some
of
its
balabce
as
it
warmed
up
as
it
warmed
it
lost
a
little
of
its
pleasant
gingerbread
quality
smooth
palate
with
a
great
linger
that
leaves
a
smaller
and
smaller
impression
of
the
beginning
flavors
bison
organic
gingerbread
ale
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
definitely
spice
cinnamon
stands
out
i
quite
like
the
taste
its
basically
a
brown
ale
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
gingerbread
spicing
a
nice
beer
for
the
holidays
it
makes
me
want
to
get
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
to
go
with
it
overall
this
beer
wanst
bad
but
it
certainly
was
not
what
i
expected
out
of
a
ginger
beer
overall
it
is
a
decent
spiced
beer
needs
something
more
though
to
tie
everything
together
reminds
me
too
much
of
ginger
ale
at
times
rather
then
the
guy
who
ran
around
trying
not
to
be
eaten
maybe
ill
give
it
another
try
around
christmas
when
its
colder
and
the
spirit
is
gingerier
being
the
season
for
the
winter
beers
i
like
to
try
em
all
and
when
this
one
caught
my
eye
i
had
to
grab
it
pour
was
a
bit
shocking
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
lighter
beer
originally
but
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
half
inch
head
that
slowly
receded
to
lacing
smell
was
a
nice
balance
of
gingerbread
and
chocolate
taste
caught
me
offguard
again
i
was
kinda
expecting
this
to
be
lighter
but
was
rather
delighted
by
the
taste
which
was
basically
like
a
gingerbread
porter
really
unique
compared
to
anything
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
bad
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
was
pretty
good
for
me
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
a
dessert
or
just
to
sip
for
a
festive
occasion
a
pretty
tasty
offering
from
bison
a
nice
spicey
indulgence
that
was
not
a
pain
to
drink
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
it
needs
to
be
a
superrecommendable
beer
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
difference
just
nothing
outrageously
good
overall
impression
an
interesting
enoug
beer
but
i
certainly
wont
be
seeking
out
more
drinkability
i
can
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
on
a
cold
winters
eve
id
like
to
try
another
batch
because
this
one
is
just
too
weird
first
beer
rating
after
receiving
my
initiate
mug
woo
hoo
drinkability
a
decent
porter
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
nothing
spectacular
its
missing
some
texture
on
the
palate
and
even
a
bit
of
flavor
besides
the
sweetness
and
roastiness
there
isnt
the
chewy
malt
that
is
claimed
on
the
bottle
while
perusing
the
beer
section
at
my
local
grocery
i
came
across
this
interesting
sounding
beer
gingerbread
ale
but
luckily
i
found
the
review
i
wrote
down
i
also
will
never
forget
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
taste
and
the
smell
of
the
beer
were
very
similar
they
both
had
a
strong
taste
of
ginger
and
spices
thin
white
lace
a
subtle
gingerbread
aroma

5drinkability
a
definite
interesting
brew
not
really
my
favorite
taste
in
a
beer
but
it
will
always
be
specialist
in
its
appeal
i
feel
unfortunately
my
fridge
has
somehow
reset
itself
recently
lightly
toasty
very
good
beer
on
its
own
fantastic
with
a
piece
of
pizza
refreshing
herbal
scent
and
taste
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
o
interesting
brew
seems
well
executed
and
enjoyable
not
a
goto
option
but
surely
one
id
like
to
have
around
o
love
the
basil
but
it
left
me
wanting
some
more
honey
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
seem
to
make
a
good
pairing
with
italian
food
or
a
veggie
burger
d
very
enjoyable
beer
light
refreshing
complex
and
goes
great
with
pizza
ill
start
looking
for
this
one
in
bottles
overall
not
that
i
would
buy
it
again
it
was
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
just
to
see
how
basil
is
incorporated
in
a
beer
its
actually
not
as
bad
as
other
say
its
not
all
that
good
for
a
spice
beer
which
is
not
my
style
anyway
but
i
tried
to
take
that
into
account
plenty
drinkable
but
unfortunately
there
isnt
anything
beyond
the
very
mild
taste
of
basil
to
hold
my
interest
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
no
head
nothing
amazing
but
not
horrible
looking
scents
of
malt
basil
and
a
slight
bit
of
honey
its
got
a
bit
going
on
here
but
its
not
quite
strong
enough
to
get
your
anticipation
up
flavor
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
a
yeasty
ale
character
moves
into
a
slight
bitterness
and
ends
with
the
taste
of
fresh
basil
basil
also
dominates
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
medicinal
quality
that
reminds
me
of
chewing
fresh
basil
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
standard
easy
drinking
feel
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
herbal
flavors
imparted
by
the
basil
really
work
with
the
sweet
malt
flavors
and
the
dryness
from
the
honey
making
it
a
nice
refreshing
beer
its
a
nice
herbed
beer
to
try
if
you
dont
want
something
too
extreme
the
basil
provides
a
perfumey
complexity
though
its
quite
sharp
and
slides
over
to
the
acidic
side
however
this
must
be
the
best
basil
beer
ive
had
its
a
tough
proposition
but
they
made
it
drinkable
also
the
only
drinkable
bison
beer
ive
had
on
tap
at
sea
rocket
in
san
diego
overall
a
strange
beer
i
wish
it
were
a
little
more
robust
if
your
going
to
do
something
weird
that
go
for
it
all
in
even
if
the
flavors
end
up
not
working
at
least
you
went
full
force
with
the
flavor
instead
of
doing
a
psuedo
unique
beer
like
this
overall
if
you
really
want
a
basil
beer
then
absolutely
go
for
this
one
however
dont
be
surprised
at
what
you
get
this
beer
is
absolutely
asadvertised
a
really
good
flavorful
and
unique
ale
drinks
easy
and
tastes
good
something
i
could
drink
regularly
pour
is
a
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
much
like
an
italian
cafe
the
basil
is
subtle
but
somehow
very
apparent
the
honey
is
integrated
well
adding
sweetness
and
depth
also
notes
of
peppery
spice
and
some
oregano
seems
well
balanced
but
just
not
aromas
i
like
together
or
in
beer
taste
is
the
same
with
notes
of
dough
this
is
basil
pizza
esq
the
honey
is
subdued
and
the
basil
is
forward
with
spice
and
oregano
strange
stuff
but
well
made
for
what
it
is
intended
to
be
it
came
from
the
back
of
the
fridge
found
this
lonely
looking
spring
seasonal
hanging
out
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
bison
organic
honey
basil
pours
out
a
redamber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
basically
what
the
nose
says
honey
and
basil
on
the
tongue
though
hey
is
this
a
pumpkin
beer
with
honey
of
course
pumpkin
beers
very
rarely
taste
of
pumpkin
they
taste
of
the
various
spices
and
im
getting
this
bigtime
behind
the
basil
and
the
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
isnt
all
that
great
too
much
on
the
spice
for
me
overall
less
interesting
than
i
expected
to
be
honest
o
a
novelty
a
good
beer
if
you
would
enjoy
a
basil
beverage
i
feel
that
the
basil
could
have
been
more
subtle
and
playful
and
not
overwhelming
dark
amber
orange
with
a
large
fluffy
pale
yellow
head
complicated
mixture
of
honey
pumpkin
basil
and
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
big
pumpkin
and
caramel
flavor
that
floats
into
a
big
hit
of
basil
spice
on
the
first
sip
herbal
earthy
mildly
spicy
body
with
a
malty
creamy
mouthfeel
mildly
bitter
spicy
finish
very
interesting
brew
never
really
had
anything
like
it
overall
probably
not
for
everyone
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
well
balanced
overall
without
being
too
complex
and
i
could
probably
have
2
or
3
in
a
session
love
the
combination
between
the
honey
sweetness
biting
hops
and
earthy
basil
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
spring
or
summer
months
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
basil
and
some
slight
honey
aromas
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
some
maltgrain
flavors
up
front
and
an
earthy
basil
spice
flavor
that
lingers
long
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
definitely
odd
and
not
something
i
would
get
again
honey
basils
a
little
light
for
my
tastes
i
have
to
work
too
hard
to
get
the
flavor
the
basil
is
nice
but
id
like
more
hops
to
mix
with
it
overall
if
the
basil
flavor
attracts
you
give
it
a
try
a
unique
profile
for
the
palate
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
i
would
drink
again
overall
very
pretty
sweet
which
is
probably
due
to
all
the
basil
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
and
smart
summer
beer
tastetoasted
maltclover
honey
herbal
basil
note
rather
delicate
subtle
flavors
in
a
decent
balance
and
interesting
flavor
that
just
manages
to
pull
it
off
a
nice
match
for
some
redsauce
italian
cuisine
a
very
malty
flavor
with
big
hints
at
honey
despite
its
presence
in
the
nose
basil
comes
on
late
but
then
becomes
dominant
malty
and
herbal
without
enough
hop
to
balance
it
lively
carbonation
but
a
small
amount
is
enough
a
weird
mishmash
of
tastes
you
wont
want
more
than
one
notes
a
good

openerchallenge
but
not
a
beer
a
will
buy
again
though
the
brewery
has
used
an
interesting
and
somewhat
surprising
combination
of
flavors
for
this
beer
they
have
done
what
many
others
have
failed
to
do
when
attempting
something
similar
and
that
is
execute
the
concept
to
a
high
standard
ill
be
drinking
this
again
in
future
o
a
intriguing
herb
beer
to
say
the
least
you
dont
see
basil
that
often
fun
to
try
inexpensive
worth
a
shot
some
good
points
some
not
so
good
points
different
and
probably
more
of
a
nice
tick
than
anything
else
not
something
that
will
be
selling
keg
after
keg
of
or
bottle
after
bottle
for
that
matter
but
an
interesting
mix
of
ingredients
and
some
point
of
difference
quite
refreshing
really
grew
on
me
a
bit
over
the
course
after
i
was
initially
ready
to
diss
it
as
a
gimmick
but
it
does
work
t
still
no
basil
i
got
a
lot
of
honey
and
caramel
with
some
malt
breadiness
throughout
not
bad
at
all
but
didnt
have
a
ton
going
on

a
hazy
golden
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing

obviously
lots
of

overall
an

that
would
be
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
spicy
thai
dish
but
to
be
honest
i
would
not
revisit
this
cheers
o
decent

had
been

to

i

i

given

i
definitely
would
have
been
better
off
buying
a

instead
of
4
this
is
a
good
everyday
beer
it
drinks
easy
like
a
macro
brew
with
a
bit
more
flavor
and
alcohol
a
bit
watery
for
me
but
good
overall
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
being
a
specialty
overall
very
decent
brew
not
overwhelming
at
all
but
interesting
in
its
taste
a
very
good
surprise
from
an
organic
beer
this
is
a
very
creative
beer
and
its
worth
seeking
out
though
at
10
a
fourpack
i
wont
be
drinking
it
regularly
o
this
beer
is
good
and
fresh
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
i
mean
i
had
this
at
a
beer
tasting
and
i
enjoyed
it
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
it
was
something
new
and
different
for
me
d
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
all
that
much
as
a
big
fan
of
basil
i
was
excited
to
try
this
offering
the
basil
was
pretty
much
nonexistent
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
uninspiring
on
draught
at
papago
pours
clear
goldenorange
color
with

aroma
has
loads
of

sage

is

bitter
with
a
sweet
honeylike
malt
backbone
medium

with

ok
but
something
i
would
not
search
out
o
sort
of
impressed
but
not
all
that
really
the
roomate
enjoys
these
types
of
beers
with
fruits
and
honey
and
such
but
id
prefer
a
nice
dark
stout
instead
o
not
bad
i
was
expecting
more
honey
taste
however
im
a
fan
of
the
natural
sweetener
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
there
but
this
beer
does
pair
well
with
some
foods
d
eh
not
bad
ill
pass
in
the
future
interesting
enough
to
try
though
o
if
you
want
this
type
of
beer
good
on
ya
neither
of
us
finished
our
pour
cheers
to
bison
for
rockin
tasty
organic
living
brews
very
drinkable
though
only
subtley
distinguishable
from
average
beers
must
be
taken
more
slowly
to
appreciate
the
subtlety
of
the
herbal
malty
character
which
could
easily
be
missed
not
really
a
memorable
beer
itself
although
it
would
be
great
with
food
say
pizza
or
fish
or
perhaps
pasta
could
be
savored
as
a
session
beer
based
on
the
residual
aftertaste
d
this
taste
like
an
amateur
beer
that
needs
more
of
a
malty
backbone
or
hops
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
anytime
soon
final
notes
i
actually
really
like
this
beer
a
nice
sweet
beer
and
one
to
check
out
for
the
honey
lovers
good
beer
to
have
with
breakfast
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
another
good
food
beer
i
like
the
suggestion
of
pizza
another
reviewer
put
forth
12oz
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
pours
a
crisp
orange
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
basil
and
garlic
with
just
a
touch
of
honey
only
a
mild
malt
presence
appears
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
with
an
interesting
spice
balance
the
beer
is
light
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
i
believe
this
beer
would
pair
nicely
with
pizza
ill
have
to
try
that
sometime
pours
a
murky
orange
amber
with
little
head
what
head
there
is
fades
to
a
very
thin
swirl
smells
very
sweet
with
lots
of
honey
and
a
vague
herbal
flavor
on
top
id
like
the
expression
of
basil
to
be
clearer
as
is
the
aromas
are
too
sweet
and
muddled
almost
medicinal
at
the
end
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
with
less
sweetness
and
more
balanced
herbalness
with
a
finish
that
has
some
more
noticeable
basil
flavor
and
some
light
firm
maltiness
drying
toward
the
end
a
little
bit
watery
but
overall
fairly
drinkable
d
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
tastes
much
more
like
a
spiced
winter
beer
than
i
would
have
expected
the
honey
is
present
in
the
aroma
but
only
survives
as
a
background
note
in
the
flavor
the
spice
character
is
all
over
the
place
and
is
clearly
influenced
by
the
caramel
malt
character
the
only
clear
basil
note
i
get
is
in
the
aftertaste
and
even
then
it
is
obscured
by
toasted
malt
and
lightly
fruity
yeast
that
seem
to
produce
spice
notes
such
as
coriander
that
apparently
arent
there
interesting
but
a
bit
cloying
on
both
the
sweetness
and
the
spice
notes
and
not
all
that
drinkable
worth
a
try
but
im
glad
i
dont
have
a
six
pack
of
this
d
enjoyable
mild
ale
with
simple
herbal
flavors
that
doesnt
detract
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
crack
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
beer
really
surprised
me
we
had
it
early
and
i
was
like
this
is
goign
to
suck
wow
great
ise
of
honey
and
the
basil
gave
it
a
nice
herbal
lemon
flavor
not
overpwering
in
any
area
and
a
solid
beer
at
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
probably
more
similar
to
a
saison
very
drinkable
if
you
like
something
a
bit
different
pours
into
a
general
ale
amber
color
with
a
standard
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
similar
to
an
amber
as
well
with
hints
of
hops
a
sort
of
wheatiness
and
and
heres
where
it
starts
to
get
unique
there
is
a
hint
of
surprise
surprise
basil
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
basil
receding
a
good
deal
into
the
background
there
isnt
much
of
a
honey
flavor
involved
though
i
do
believe
it
added
a
bit
of
lightness
to
the
body
without
resorting
to
ubereffervescence
which
made
this
brew
a
rather
drinkable
one
despite
its
overall
lack
of
general
character
i
have
never
had
a
beer
drinking
experience
like
this
so
bison
definitely
gets
props
for
creativity
so
if
you
want
to
try
something
totally
odd
go
find
this
oneif
you
can
as
for
me
im
just
glad
i
bought
a
single
and
not
the
whole
10dollar
4pack
drinkability
i
came
to
this
beer
with
exceedingly
low
expectations
but
wound
up
really
enjoying
it
bet
it
would
pair
nicely
with
spicy
asian
cuisines
d
an
oddly
drinkable
beer
drinkability
i
was
always
hesitant
of
trying
this
beer
because
i
couldnt
picture
what
basil
would
taste
like
in
beer
well
this
one
doesnt
taste
like
basil
but
it
does
taste
very
good
its
one
of
the
easier
drinking
beers
i
have
had
as
well
appearance
was
a
pale
amber
with
decent
carbonation
smells
is
dominated
by
basil
but
not
an
overwhelming
aroma
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
basil
the
honey
is
very
subtle
at
first
but
seems
to
come
through
more
in
the
finish
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
i
really
wasnt
sure
id
like
this
style
but
its
actually
pretty
good
not
a
beer
youd
want
in
mass
quantities
but
still
a
good
change
of
pace
in
the
summer
and
probably
is
an
excellent
food
pairing
for
chicken
and
the
like
drinkability
with
its
oddball
flavor
profile
this
sure
is
one
droll
beer
to
taste
mostly
this
started
great
and
as
you
drink
it
it
gets
harder
to
stomach
the
over
spiced
beer
if
organic
honey
basil
is
a
money
maker
for
bison
they
might
just
as
well
start
a
whole
new
line
of
herbal
beers
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
might
be
good
places
to
start
as
far
as
plants
go
however
i
think
ill
stick
with
hops
beer
is
good
happy
different
beering
crystal
clear
mellow
gold
towering
glassfilling
head
of
loose
packed
dusty
white
foam
of
mixed
size
bubbles
heavily
dimpled
surface
that
slowly
settles
but
leaves
a
thick
chunk
on
top
all
the
way
down
there
were
a
few
wide
thick
strands
of
lacing
minimal
carbonation
streams
drift
upwards
sweet
light
honey
and
zest
comes
through
along
with
a
ginger
ale
soda
aroma
the
lightly
sweet
honey
fills
out
the
initial
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
pale
malt
there
is
a
spiciness
that
shows
up
in
the
finish
that
is
barely
discernable
as
basil
had
i
not
known
to
expect
basil
i
probably
would
not
have
identified
it
as
such
there
is
a
general
saison
component
to
the
taste
that
is
perhaps
more
suggestive
than
actual
the
spiciness
changes
over
to
a
bitterness
which
clings
at
the
edges
for
a
tad
bit
too
long
medium
body
and
smooth
to
soft
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
nice
that
this
is
a
certified
organic
beer
which
includes
basil
from
watanabe
farms
and
honey
from
britts
honey
but
the
basil
was
barely
discernable
still
this
was
enjoyable
this
beer
poured
very
golden
and
clear
with
no
head
not
what
i
expected
from
other
reviews
its
smell
is
very
nice
and
reminds
me
of
the
times
that
i
have
made
mead
very
faintly
but
it
did
really
this
beers
taste
has
little
resemblance
to
mead
though
the
basil
stands
out
a
little
bit
which
makes
me
wonder
where
the
hints
of
garlic
should
i
brew
a
pesto
beer
or
just
add
honey
and
beer
to
my
next
pesto
over
all
this
honey
basil
beer
is
very
welcoming
especially
strait
from
the
freezer
on
this
first
80
day
of
the
year
i
would
recommend
this
for
a
midsummers
day
picnic
serve
as
cold
as
you
can
get
it
cheers
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
think
this
beer
could
be
a
little
better
if
the
malt
and
hops
were
not
organic
i
am
a
true
believer
in
organic
foods
especially
meat
and
milk
products
but
ive
yet
to
have
an
organic
beer
really
wow
me
that
being
said
this
honey
basil
beer
along
with
bisons
chocolate
stout
are
definitely
the
best
organic
beers
that
i
have
tasted
drinkability

i
cant
say
that
i
plan
on
finishing
the
entire
bomber
but
its
not
halfbad
received
a
bottle
from
our
local
rep
the
other
day
and
figured
id
give
it
a
try
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
topped
by
a
big
foamy
white
head
aroma
offers
what
the
name
promises
light
honey
sharp
basil
some
lavender
notes
and
some
astringency
palate
is
more
of
the
same
basil
is
the
dominant
character
with
light
hops
and
a
tinge
of
honey
sweetness
body
is
nice
light
and
refreshing
but
theres
a
good
bit
of
tangy
astringency
thats
slightly
offputting
maybe
this
floats
some
peoples
boats
more
than
others
but
i
found
it
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
nevertheless
an
interesting
offering
poured
into
a
pint
glass
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
head
that
soon
disappears
into
a
few
bubbles
slight
hop
aroma
with
strong
hints
of
honey
and
some
lemony
smells
taste
is
good
had
nice
hop
backbone
with
honey
and
cirtus
flavors
the
basil
flavors
seem
less
noticable
feels
a
little
thinner
in
the
mouth
than
i
would
like
but
still
pretty
good
very
drinkable
this
was
a
great
beer
very
refreshing
great
on
a
summer
day
i
would
bet
nice
drinkability
and
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
spicedfruit
beers
i
have
tried
this
was
one
tasty
little
surprise
sweet
crisp
and
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
looking
to
sample
something
different
recommended
iam
always
looking
to
try
new
and
interesting
styles
of
beer
and
honey
basil
seemed
like
a
diferent
combination
poured
a
dull
golden
with
a
thinner
quick
vanishing
white
head
leaving
no
lacethe
aromas
were
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
in
my
mind
very
floral
with
that
honey
being
a
bit
more
noticable
than
the
basil
flavors
start
out
with
that
honey
sweetness
and
steadily
fades
into
the
quite
noticable
herbal
basil
flavor
also
a
touch
of
mintthe
finish
is
lightly
earthy
and
that
basil
pops
up
again
i
kinda
like
it
its
different
but
not
obtrusive
its
on
the
lighter
side
and
i
think
would
be
food
friendly
overall
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
but
i
found
it
to
be
more
than
pleasant
fans
of
the
range
of
brews
from
heather
ales
fraoch
grozet
ebulum
alba
etc
should
enjoy
this
i
know
did
nicely
done
for
those
that
like
the
style
an
interesting
try
once
beer
but
i
feel
no
need
to
return
o
technically
well
made
a
touch
too
sweet
but
no
bad
aftertastes
an
interesting
drink
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
lacked
some
boldness
and
bitterness
that
i
enjoy
in
a
higher
abv
beer
all
in
all
not
bad
for
the
style
intense
but
great
ancient
ale
very
good
beer
sweet
aroma
and
taste
very
smooth
pours
honey
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
sweet
malt
and
honey
smells
tastes
are
very
interesting
malt
honey
mild
grape
in
the
background
mild
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
finish
a
combination
of
a
malt
forward
beer
but
with
a
mead
blend
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
smells
of
light
spices
and
maltiness
the
taste
is
complex
starts
with
muscat
grapes
that
lingers
into
honey
followed
by
a
malty
finish
this
beer
is
refreshingly
different
almost
like
a
blend
of
mead
moscato
wine
and
beer
very
unique
and
easy
to
drink
you
wont
even
know
that
its
9
abv
id
drink
it
more
often
if
it
wasnt
12
for
4
bottles

is

flavor
is
bright
light
and
really
easy
to
like
in
this
beer
juicy
middle
herbal
back
notes
dry
bubbly
the
honey
on
this
one
is
like
a
raw
floral
scent
and
taste
is
light
orange
and
a
fruit
rind
scent
that
i
cant
place
spice
bread
crusts
and
a
mild
ester
from
alcohol
a
bit
of
alcohol
sweetness
on
the
palate
too
but
not
even
any
warming
delightful
the
malt
was
so
deep
on
this
pale
beer
the
flavors
crisp
and
the
breaddiness
surprising
this
stuff
is
freaking
great
i
only
give
it
this
score
because
i
did
drink
it
but
glad
i
have
an
dipa
to
wash
this
taste
away
quickly
overall
this
is
a
fairly
complex
beer
that
will
please
the
white
wine
lover
the
grapes
and
spices
give
it
a
rather
dry
winelike
flavor
profile
on
the
whole
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
end
just
had
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
and
its
even
better
than
the
bottled
version
midas
has
such
complex
flavors
that
just
tickle
every
single
taste
bud
it
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
if
you
see
this
on
draft
get
it
i
liked
it
very
much
is
that
enough
easy
drinking
not
bitter
flavors
of
grape
and
honey
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
hard
pressed
to
find
a
beer
with
a
higher
abv
and
lower
ibu
beautiful
beer
taste
of
raisins
very
crisp
and
dry
o
interesting
definitely
worth
a
try
pretend
youre
a
pharaoh
not
a
bad
offering
honey
and
grape
on
the
nose
with
some
hints
of
the
advertised
spices
fermented
honey
flavor
plus
butter
allspice
and
raisins
could
have
been
a
dud
bottle
this
was
bought
in
australia
and
was
rather
old
this
has
got
to
be
the
smoothest
beer
to
have
ever
been
poured
down
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
the
taste
though
so
it
was
a
disappointment
i
would
have
loved
more
grape
flavor
overall
its
nice
and
different
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweetness
i
love
dogfish
and
i
was
excited
about
the
line
of
ancient
beers
not
my
thing
with
the
honey
but
it
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
had
a
nice
aroma
o
great
flavor
that
surprised
me
a
super
mix
of
subtle
flavors
and
i
love
the
dryness
o
nice
not
for
every
day
but
good
taste
but
sometimes
the
funky
cheap
lager
taste
surfaces
o
tasty
first
beer
thats
sweet
but
dissent
overdue
it
great
beerwine
feel
described
as
an
ancient
ale
it
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
head
that
foams
up
nicely
but
retreats
quickly
the
nose
is
complex
with
honey
bananas
muscat
grapes
the
hop
character
is
very
subdued
if
present
at
all
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
like
in
a
belgianstyle
again
there
is
good
flavor
of
honey
it
is
full
bodied
with
a
nice
alcohol
heat
that
is
equal
to
the
carbonation
and
cream
i
had
one
of
these
in
my
wine
cellar
for
about
11
months
after
purchase
and
it
was
just
as
good
as
the
first
one
i
ever
opened
glass
perfect
pint
good
but
not
great
beer
definitely
not
one
to
turn
down
when
gven
the
opportunity
v
i
gave
the
lowest
rating
because
this
stuff
is
over
14
dollars
for
a
4
pack
locally
please
enter
at
least
five
tmo
the
first
thing
that
jumps
out
at
me
is
the
feel
fairly
full
bodied
but
smooth
finish
is
kind
of
macro
grainy
and
a
bit
off
putting
the
flavor
is
similar
very
grainy
and
malty
the
white
wine
grape
is
the
only
real
redeeming
quality
of
the
beer
kind
of
like
a
imperial
adjunct
lager
with
some
white
wine
and
honey
hints
not
bad
but
not
great
either
but
good
enough
while
i
find
the
concept
of
ancient
ales
to
be
an
interesting
science
experiment
my
overall
feeling
is
that
if
these
beer
recipes
didnt
survive
time
there
might
be
a
reason
definitely
one
for
the
tickers
and
potential
crossover
beer
for
the
macro
fans
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
wouldnt
choose
it
over
others
strong
grape
taste
yeah
thats
right
its
a
perfect
beer
not
what
i
expected
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
something
just
seemed
off
about
it
i
may
have
to
give
it
another
try
at
a
later
date
just
to
be
fair
very
sweet
floral
and
boozy
with
a
sticky
syrupy
mouthfeel
more
like
a
mead
than
a
beer
worth
trying
but
once
was
enough
for
me
unique
beer
with
lots
of
different
flavors
sweet
from
the
honey
but
interesting
hops
add
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
out
there
seems
almost
a
split
personality
in
mixing
a
melange
of
strong
flavoured
ingredients
and
also
creating
a
beer
with
a
broad
appeal
i
did
really
enjoy
the
skill
that
went
into
crafting
this
given
that
ingrediant
list
i
doubt
i
could
replicate
something
with
this
complexity
and
nuance
for
that
i
will
forgive
some
of
the
critiques
and
say
this
was
a
beer
i
was
certainly
glad
to
try
notes
this
is
simply
an
awesome
classic
the
label
tells
you
it
includes
honey
and
the
honey
is
what
makes
this
so
smooth
if
it
werent
for
all
the
other
ingredients
that
remind
you
youre
drinking
beer
and
not
honey
youd
think
you
were
guzzling
from
one
of
those
plastic
bears
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
by
the
saffron
and
other
fun
stuff
included
and
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
day
for
a
long
time
if
i
could
o
an
interesting
flavor
profile
delicious
highly
unusual
at
9
this
delivers
the
hammer
but
the
alcohol
remains
largely
hidden
it
reminds
me
of
ciders
and
yes
wine
in
its
flavor
profile
but
the
close
is
all
about
grains
and
beer
flavors
not
something
id
grab
often
but
something
i
might
share
with
my
wine
drinking
friends
to
illustrate
the
range
of
what
a
beer
can
be
overall
i
like
this
beer
in
that
like
many
of
dfhs
other
products
it
is
unique
and
challenges
conventional
beer
as
others
have
commented
i
wouldnt
drink
it
everyday
but
would
certainly
buy
again
and
have
on
occasion
would
be
great
with
a
meal
i
am
more
of
a
stoutporter
guy
so
ill
get
straight
to
the
point
you
will
like
this
most
everyone
you
offer
it
to
will
like
this
its
a
bit
pricey
which
is
preventing
me
from
giving
it
any
higher
but
a
great
beer
all
around
heard
others
bring
comparisons
to
bells
venus
this
imo
trumps
it
easily
o
very
cool
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
not
something
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis

one
of
the
better
dogfish
beers
maybe
one
of
the
best
they
have
ever
made
o
unique
look
and
taste
pretty
sweet
and
makes
for
a
great
drink
i
feel
like
its
most
appropriate
in
the
winter
not
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
brews
but
for
a
change
of
pace
give
it
a
try
different
and
interesting
but
doesnt
really
ring
my
bell
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
20
firestone
glass
poured
a
golden
color
with
one
inch
head
smell
is
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
taste
remained
me
of
the
time
i
drank
mead
very
sweet
once
again
this
is
one
of
those
times
where
i
cant
recommend
this
to
a
beer
drinker
because
its
more
like
a
mead
its
just
to
sweet
for
me
i
have
loved
all
the
other
dogfish
head
beers
i
have
drank
before
but
this
one
was
not
up
to
there
standards
motley
out
golden
colored
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
white
foam
covers
most
of
the
top
i
detect
the
muscat
grapes
and
the
honey
in
the
aroma
the
saffron
gives
it
a
slightly
herbal
edge
the
flavor
is
initially
favored
by
the
honey
and
barleybut
the
back
of
the
palate
is
initially
the
muscat
grapes
and
then
the
saffron
really
heads
to
the
forefront
and
it
finishes
with
the
strong
herbal
kick
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
the
honey
lends
dryness
o
i
was
very
intrigued
by
this
beer
and
wanted
to
buy
it
for
a
long
time
but
found
myself
complacent
with
more
contemporary
beer
styles
and
seeing
as
this
beer
is
near
14
bucks
for
a
4
pack
i
found
it
hard
to
justify
the
purchase
however
i
am
glad
i
purchased
this
beer
because
it
really
feels
like
a
timemachine
in
glass
it
is
hard
to
rate
this
beer
because
considering
the
template
they
used
to
make
it
is
archaic
i
dont
really
have
a
viable
frame
of
reference
i
saw
other
reviews
lamenting
about
how
it
didnt
meet
their
expectations
and
how
they
would
rather
drink
an
ipa
but
such
a
comment
sounds
illfounded
to
me
in
all
honesty
this
beer
is
simply
a
tribute
to
the
history
of
beer
and
if
you
cant
appreciate
it
as
that
and
would
rather
judge
it
with
a
contemporary
and
biased
perspective
then
this
beer
obviously
isnt
for
you
if
you
want
to
taste
the
diversity
dogfishhead
has
to
offer
and
their
love
for
the
craft
and
its
history
then
this
beer
is
definitely
for
you
pours
an
interesting
pink
color
no
head
carbonated
more
like
a
white
wine
interesting
smell
is
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
wine
than
beer
little
bit
musty
well
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
wine
very
fruity
along
with
the
sweetness
of
honey
tastes
more
like
a
beer
than
wine
the
mouth
feel
though
is
again
like
wine
most
interesting
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
although
i
dont
think
this
is
actually
classified
as
a
beer
definitely
never
had
anything
like
it
before
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
with
very
little
and
fine
head
a
rich
golden
color
with
very
good
clarity
this
does
not
look
or
taste
like
a
2700
year
old
recipe
at
all
its
a
bold
beautiful
beer
with
hint
of
malt
and
white
grape
aroma
and
sweet
honey
taste
dogfish
head
use
a
wonderful
yeast
that
i
have
come
to
associate
with
a
series
of
wonderful
beers
over
the
years
and
the
midas
is
no
exception
thanks
to
my
friend
who
found
this
beer
at
a
beer
store
and
picked
it
up
for
me
o
an
excellent
beer
that
often
gets
overlooked
as
it
isnt
a
hop
filled
or
deep
and
dark
full
concoction
if
you
appreciate
beer
and
have
an
open
mind
this
beer
will
fulfill
your
wants
a
definite
purchase
for
the
occasional
glass
at
12
99
a
4
pack
bottle
poured
into
glass
there
is
a
thin
white
head
the
appearance
is
golden
hazy
yellow
with
visible
carbonation
bubbles
very
sweet
and
wonderful
aroma
on
the
nose
honey
and
grab
are
prevalent
very
carbonated
in
the
mouth
sweet
can
taste
the
honey
and
the
grape
followed
by
alcohol
interesting
and
unique
quite
tasty
o
a
good
beer
but
nothing
great
i
appreciate
the
taste
of
saffron
but
this
beer
was
quite
expensive
for
me
5
for
a
12
oz
bottle
at
my
local
bottle
shop
and
it
was
not
as
special
as
a
lot
of
people
make
it
out
to
be
definitely
worth
trying
but
nothing
special
besides
its
high
alcohol
content
and
its
white
grape
based
taste
o
this
beer
is
strange
to
say
the
least
but
nevertheless
its
extremely
cool
for
the
one
of
the
most
respected
breweries
to
resurrect
this
ancient
style
i
drink
this
and
daydream
im
king
midas
drinking
with
my
many
wives
and
not
worrying
bout
much
this
beer
is
hardly
a
considered
a
beer
by
todays
standards
and
is
more
closely
related
to
a
mead
or
alcoholic
concoction
of
some
sort
love
it
all
the
same
considering
the
price
i
paid
i
was
hoping
for
a
beverage
with
the
midas
touch
instead
i
got
something
that
was
mediocre
at
best
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
and
very
little
retention
the
smell
actually
reminded
me
of
adjuncts
not
malt
or
hops
the
taste
was
even
on
the
hot
side
particularly
after
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
and
the
mouth
feel
average
at
best
with
poor
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
but
just
marginally
i
am
sorry
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
will
be
going
back
to
90
minute
ipa
if
i
want
something
from
dfh
this
is
not
a
beer
that
is
worth
3
bucks
a
bottle
at
retail
smells
of
white
grapes
and
malt
with
a
small
amount
of
saffron
to
follow
tasting
it
the
grape
is
the
strongest
with
hints
of
honey
and
saffron
the
malt
does
come
through
after
a
few
sips
after
a
while
i
feel
as
i
have
been
drinking
white
wine
as
well
the
finish
is
crisp
and
has
a
aftertaste
of
grapes
i
would
buy
again
overall
i
love
dog
fish
head
and
this
brew
is
from
the
ancient
ale
series
my
first
one
and
i
am
very
excited
to
try
them
all
i
would
recommend
this
brew
and
dog
fish
head
brewery
and
since
they
were
just
on
a
recent
brew
dogs
episode
i
am
sure
they
are
going
to
gain
a
lot
more
popularity
well
done
my
friends
o
unique
and
a
nice
beer
bonus
points
for
the
cool
history
which
cant
be
quantified
in
the
scores
here
lacking
in
a
few
areas
but
i
wouldnt
mind
another
overall
for
being
a
year
old
this
beer
held
up
well
and
tasted
good
i
really
love
this
one
it
is
complex
but
simple
enough
to
get
the
major
notes
of
what
the
beer
is
going
for
i
get
strong
notes
of
honey
and
spice
which
lead
into
a
dry
herbal
finish
its
fresh
and
round
with
a
great
balance
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
drinking
chardonnay
o
really
unique
beer
drinks
more
like
a
wine
or
a
mead
than
a
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
probably
pass
on
it
in
the
future
o
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
love
the
history
aspect
of
trying
to
imagine
what
it
was
like
to
drink
something
similar
to
this
5000
years
ago
would
definitely
pick
up
again
and
recommend
to
anyone
overy
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
def
have
another
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
know
not
everyone
is
crazy
about
the
aa
series
but
i
thing
dfh
did
some
cool
things
with
the
flavors
of
this
beer
overall
this
one
of
those
strange
beers
newage
slash
ancient
beers
which
usually
relegates
it
to
the
category
of
terrible
but
dogfish
head
got
this
one
right
o
ive
got
to
say
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
the
spiced
beer
category
is
incredibly
vast
and
i
have
had
almost
nothing
but
bad
experiences
with
spiced
ales
but
i
was
more
than
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
if
it
has
one
downside
it
is
that
it
might
almost
be
too
rich
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
glass
at
a
time
that
said
it
is
not
bad
by
any
means
and
i
applaud
dogfish
head
for
creating
something
incredibly
unique
props
mouthfeel
the
body
is
medium
but
the
grapes
leave
a
real
buttering
flavor
in
my
mouth
i
love
dogfish
heads
ancient
ales
program
for
many
reasons
but
the
main
one
is
that
opening
up
a
bottle
of
one
of
these
brews
is
a
way
of
trying
to
understand
the
tastes
of
civilizations
past
this
beer
is
as
much
as
it
is
asking
you
to
evaluate
it
based
on
your
contemporary
tastes
try
and
imagine
living
in
a
world
where
while
you
knead
your
bread
and
prevent
the
swirling
dust
from
getting
into
your
eyes
and
the
dough
in
your
hands
it
asks
us
to
reevaluate
our
position
and
our
expectations
of
a
beer
and
of
what
we
can
enjoy
and
by
what
criteria
this
beer
may
fall
a
bit
flat
to
ordinary
standard
but
its
not
an
ordinary
beer
overall
a
really
good
and
interesting
brew
good
fruit
esters
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
is
big
but
far
from
cloying
o
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
after
reading
sacred
and
herbal
healing
beers
i
was
very
happy
to
remember
this
beer
by
dogfish
head
and
get
a
chance
to
experience
an
old
recipe
honestly
it
underwhelmed
me
im
glad
a
tried
it
though
not
something
i
would
buy
again
considering
the
price
but
i
admire
dogfish
head
for
putting
this
out
lemon
honey
color
and
transparent
weak
head
with
minimal
lacing
lots
of
white
grapes
in
the
aroma
sweet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
dense
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
white
grapes
hint
of
honey
ads
to
the
sweetness
weak
hop
character
just
a
mild
leaf
quality
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
sugary
texture
decent
carbonation
overalla
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
ok
for
something
different
following
a
toast
to
those
who
inspired
this
recipe
i
sipped
the
beer
and
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
to
taste
a
beer
with
an
actual
mouthfeel
while
beer
aficionados
frequently
laud
those
brews
with
a
long
mouth
feel
i
tend
to
believe
the
abundance
of
carbonation
precludes
a
mouthfeel
on
par
with
what
a
complex
wine
can
offer
in
contrast
this
honey
heavy
concoction
has
a
buttery
quality
that
coats
the
mouth
and
makes
it
a
great
selection
to
pair
with
food
o
glad
i
bought
a
4pack
but
this
isnt
something
i
will
be
rushing
out
to
repurchase
interesting
tasting
brew
with
a
unique
aroma
and
mouthfeel
profile
3
5
overall
i
like
how
this
toes
the
line
with
quite
a
bit
of
wine
elements
it
is
very
unique
ive
certainly
never
drank
a
brew
that
reminded
me
of
wine
for
all
the
right
reasons
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
fellow
craft
enthusiasts
that
also
want
to
try
out
an
b
c
era
style
also
to
have
it
be
consumed
on
a
golden
autumn
evening
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
when
im
feeling
like
a
truly
unique
experience
overall
i
was
blown
away
by
this
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
brews
i
have
had
so
incredibly
complex
extremely
light
easy
drinking
hard
to
imagine
this
is
9
abv
this
beer
should
be
in
a
style
all
to
its
own
leave
it
to
dogfish
head
to
go
totally
out
of
the
conventional
box
this
will
now
be
among
my
top
list
of
favorite
beers
ill
admit
i
only
bought
this
because
it
was
billed
as
a
handcrafted
ancient
ale
and
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
that
wasnt
an
ipa
stout
or
porter
i
liked
the
aroma
and
the
taste
although
i
had
trouble
identifying
exactly
what
it
was
i
was
smelling
and
tasting
the
only
thing
i
could
reliably
identify
was
honey
i
even
went
and
smelled
different
spices
from
my
spice
cabinet
to
try
to
narrow
it
down
the
bottle
said
saffron
and
white
muscat
grapes
neither
of
which
i
am
familiar
enough
with
to
make
any
sort
of
comment
on
at
any
rate
it
was
enjoyable
enough
and
i
was
happy
to
expand
my
palate
with
it
looks
like
golden
honey
smell
is
of
grapes
and
honey
subtle
but
sweet
notes
almost
like
a
flower
that
i
cannot
directly
name
taste
is
honey
and
grapes
as
well
almost
similar
to
champagnecider
combination
quite
delicious
poured
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
pale
to
copperish
color
small
to
medium
head
taste
of
honey
and
muscat
grapes
an
addicting
flavor
over
taste
is
amazing
and
mouthful
is
that
of
wine
so
i
gave
4
75
instead
of
a
5
another
great
beer
from
dogfishhead
peter
out
final
thoughts
13
a
4
pack
is
crazy
not
stoked
on
that
the
tatse
and
9
abv
makes
up
for
it
a
little
bit
o
although
i
would
certainly
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
for
a
more
accurate
sensory
experience
and
am
fortunate
to
learn
this
is
a
yearround
offering
i
am
nothing
but
blown
away
by
what
i
have
sampled
at
just
over
a
year
old
as
much
as
i
have
endorsed
theobroma
and
sahtea
in
previous
reviews
this
now
stands
to
be
my
second
favorite
to
theobroma
and
just
edging
out
sahtea
in
dfhs
ancient
ale
series
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
just
might
find
its
way
into
my
top
20
if
not
10
beers

alltime

bottle
amber
color
mild
head
fruity
aroma
a
balance
of
fruit
spice
and
sweetness
with
mild
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
a
really
nice
distinctive
balanced
beernothing
i
would
want
a
lot
of
or
often
but
a
very
nice
experience
this
unusual
brew
is
a
welcome
alternative
in
the
high
abv
class
pour
it
like
a
traditional
belgian
but
dont
expect
the
overt
yeastiness
what
awaits
is
more
similar
to
a
double
lager
refreshing
and
gulpable
with
instant
satiety
notes
of
grape
and
honey
permeate
and
bitterness
lingers
the
aroma
is
hard
to
place
is
it
a
similar
smell
or
something
altogether
different
ponder
saffron
as
you
drink
with
king
midas
in
the
afterlife
this
beer
lives
on
and
so
must
he
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
o
not
unbalanced
but
the
finish
could
be
more
agreeable
ive
enjoyed
some
of
the
other
ancient
ales
dogfish
has
done
this
one
doesnt
excite
me
very
much
however
i
think
this
beer
was
worth
buying
i
would
get
it
on
tap
if
i
had
the
opportunity
i
would
suggest
trying
it
once
for
sure
to
decide
for
yourself
overall
good
beer
time
and
time
again
a
little
different
with
high
abv
yet
is
incredibly
refreshing
that
you
almost
forget
o
i
loved
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
but
the
last
time
i
had
it
was
more
than
a
couple
years
ago
my
notes
are
extremely
minimal
and
this
was
tried
im
assuming
less
than
a
hundred
beers
into
my
journey
when
most
of
the
beers
i
had
tried
were
lagers
overall
different
and
enjoyable
im
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
again
but
it
was
kind
of
cool
knowing
that
im
drinking
a
beer
brewed
from
an
ancient
recipe
overall
very
interesting
beer
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
before
seems
like
a
hybrid
of
mead
beer
and
champagne
even
though
the
taste
could
be
a
little
more
complex
ideally
and
the
booziness
and
mouthfeel
arent
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
its
fantastic
smells
amazing
and
tastes
quite
excellent
as
well
not
to
mention
the
idea
of
this
beer
is
really
awesome
will
be
picking
up
again
highly
recommended
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
idea
of
this
beer
the
recipe
is
partly
a
reverseengineered
ancient
mesopotamian
recipe
is
better
than
the
beer
itself
and
for
its
relatively
high
price
there
are
equal
or
even
better
beers
to
be
had
still
it
is
worth
a
try
or
two
or
three
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
crystal
bright
hay
with
a
light
head
that
fades
quickly
with
decent
lacing
anyone
who
rates
any
of
these
ancient
ales
low
on
smell
isnt
paying
attention
grape
forward
very
floral
and
fruit
similar
to
some
of
the
whites
from
california
the
nose
gives
way
to
barley
and
honey
blended
together
in
a
complex
aromatic
together
the
saffron
isnt
as
visible
on
the
nose
for
me
immediately
when
tasting
the
honey
and
barley
come
together
on
my
palate
this
is
honey
nut
cheerios
and
it
is
awesome
the
saffron
is
blended
in
well
and
hardly
noticeable
as
a
direct
spice
the
grapes
themselves
make
the
backbone
of
the
taste
and
lead
it
into
a
long
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
small
bubbles
and
decent
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
saw
this
at
my
local
store
and
thought
it
looked
good
the
description
made
it
sound
like
the
nectar
of
the
gods
but
it
was
a
hige
let
down
it
looked
decent
when
poured
and
smelled
ok
lots
of
grapes
and
sweetness
but
the
taste
is
what
killed
it
it
tasted
like
grape
flavored
bud
light
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
like
water
i
was
severely
disappointed
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
petrus
chalice
o
worth
trying
at
least
once
pours
well
it
is
an
almost
perfect
honey
color
not
much
head
not
highly
carbonated
which
is
nice
this
helps
with
the
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
has
strong
notes
of
the
saffron
used
to
spice
it
it
tastes
sweet
at
first
but
fades
to
a
spiciness
that
finishes
smoothly
good
overall
flavor
sweet
and
spicy
very
malty
aroma
orange
zest
herbs
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
plum
wine
appearance
see
through
copper
with
a
thin
foam
top
taste
grape
juice
overtones
with
fairly
complex
notes
of
slick
molasses
plums
figs
sweet
orange
peel
saffron
herbs
resinous
hop
oils
and
graham
cracker
malt
base
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
huge
grape
fruit
juiciness
to
it
i
can
also
taste
the
honey
and
it
works
well
with
the
graham
cracker
tasting
malts
very
unique
beer
a
rating
this
beer
is
just
in
your
face
bold
and
thick
while
higher
in
alcohol
content
it
is
masked
decently
the
flavors
are
strong
this
is
what
i
imagine
a
concentrated
barleywine
to
taste
like
very
nice
again
from
dogfish
head
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
their
90
minute
ipa
which
goes
to
show
just
how
good
that
particular
offering
was
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
and
more
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
possibly
due
to
the
alcohol
content
but
it
was
certainly
a
good
beer
interesting
brew
with
more
malt
than
i
recall
not
as
complex
as
it
couldve
been
especially
for
the
price
theres
a
diacetyl
note
that
surfaces
in
the
aftertaste
and
detracts
as
well
overall
im
disappointed
by
this
dogfish
and
i
wont
likely
buy
it
again
it
tastes
pleasant
for
its
abv
but
thats
also
not
a
saving
grace
for
a
beer
the
fruitiness
does
not
do
enough
for
the
bitterness
and
strong
taste
of
alcohol
bought
a
4pack
at
table
and
vine
beer
poured
nicely
and
has
a
very
clear
yellow
appearance
definitely
lives
up
to
the
gold
theme
very
thin
head
at
first
until
nothing
much
was
left
and
thin
lacing
fruity
aromas
of
grapes
and
honey
along
with
a
spice
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
definitely
an
attractive
smell
taste
was
decent
the
beer
was
sweet
with
grapes
and
a
citrus
flavoring
with
a
touch
of
that
honey
that
you
can
smell
nothing
that
made
me
go
wow

d
very
drinkable
really
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
nicely
balanced
the
sweet
flavors
are
a
bit
bold
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
flavors
to
balance
dogfish
head
midas
touch
pours
a
dark
hazy
orange
with
just
faint
lightening
at
edges
of
the
glass
theres
maybe
two
fingers
of
off
white
foam
and
neither
head
retention
nor
lacing
are
particularly
impressive
the
nose
is
nice
giving
all
the
special
ingredients
a
chance
to
shine
juicy
muscat
grapes
are
the
centerpiece
sweetened
up
a
bit
by
the
unmistakable
aroma
of
honey
saffron
is
present
as
well
albeit
not
quite
as
immediately
noticeable
as
the
other
two
grapes
jump
out
again
on
the
flavor
palate
its
not
nearly
as
acidic
as
some
beers
ive
had
that
were
brewed
with
them
honey
flavor
comes
through
as
well
as
a
bit
of
apples
to
give
the
illusion
of
sweetness
the
saffron
that
comes
in
on
the
back
end
is
a
bit
too
loud
and
brassy
though
and
ruins
the
delicate
balance
found
at
first
the
body
is
nicely
dried
not
as
much
as
a
well
made
belgian
beer
belgian
strong
pale
seems
to
be
a
good
close
comparison
for
this
beer
but
enough
to
serve
the
beer
well
the
carbonation
falls
a
little
bit
flat
though
midas
touch
is
the
rare
just
ok
beer
for
me
from
dogfish
head
i
usually
tend
to
either
love
or
hate
their
brews
o
alright
i
was
looking
for
a
light
beer
and
this
fits
the
bill
but
with
a
much
higher
abv
than
most
beers
that
tastefeel
this
light
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
again
another
dfh
beer
that
i
would
not
go
back
to
o
good
beer
makes
me
think
of
a
vineyard
making
a
working
mans
beer
with
the
leftover
ingredients
sitting
around
would
highly
recommend
this
may
be
the
only
fruitspice
beer
that
ive
found
bearable
im
still
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
either
but
im
starting
to
think
i
may
never
like
this
style
however
ill
rate
it
according
to
others
ive
had
in
its
category
the
backend
of
this
beers
taste
is
its
highlight
as
you
get
a
lot
of
different
flavors
i
just
never
felt
like
this
beer
knew
where
it
was
going
also
i
would
drink
this
really
cold
as
i
enjoyed
it
less
as
it
heated
up
unlike
usual
overall
good
for
the
pilsner
or
belgian
pale
ale
drinker
one
was
all
i
need
at
9
abv
couldnt
tell
thou
pours
a
dark
golden
colour
viscous
and
looks
like
honey
bottle
dated
dec
2011
has
little
carbonation
aroma
is
surprisingly
malt
forward
given
the
impressive
list
of
other
ingredients
my
palates
not
developed
enough
to
find
the
saffron
but
the
honey
and
grapes
are
definitely
present
in
both
aroma
and
taste
the
flavour
backbone
is
of
sweet
malts
and
champagne
with
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
nicely
bitter
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
comes
across
almost
like
a
wine
to
me
which
makes
me
want
to
drink
only
about
half
a
bottle
in
a
single
setting
o
overall
i
wasnt
a
very
big
fan
but
i
appeciate
the
uniqueness
here
and
how
everything
seems
to
come
together
despite
the
lack
of
enjoyable
flavors
o
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
interesting
flavors
and
very
drinkable
especially
for
9
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
traditional
styles
overall
a
truly
interesting
brew
from
a
brewery
that
makes
just
that
this
one
has
some
interesting
flavours
that
are
great
to
let
the
palette
explore
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
d
its
definitely
a
sipper
and
drinks
like
a
winemeadbeer
combo
worth
a
try
though
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
this
may
be
more
of
a
braggot
and
not
a
beer
though
im
not
sure
the
honey
was
fermented
overall
not
a
bad
beer
good
for
sipping
very
pleasant
fruity
malty
aftertaste
a
pours
a
nice
gold
brown
color
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
scent
of
grape
and
sweet
scents
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
sipping
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
while
watching
a
good
movie
this
was
a
good
presentation
of
the
style
the
alcohol
taste
was
pretty
strong
but
it
fit
nicely
in
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
o
i
do
like
this
beer
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
definite
honey
flavors
but
doesnt
taste
of
mead
like
port
city
tidings
grapes
are
giving
it
the
champagne
taste
very
good
sipping
beer
would
probably
drink
again
for
a
change
of
pace
would
probably
give
it
a
4
2
out
of
5
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
something
i
enjoyed
that
much
though
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
as
the
9
percent
was
really
not
noticeable
at
all
reminded
me
of
most
closely
the
noble
rot
i
had
recently
tried
but
not
quite
as
winy
and
lacking
that
tartness
i
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
i
would
visit
it
again
i
would
say
the
biggest
surprise
for
me
was
the
balance
as
i
think
i
expected
sweeter
beer
interesting
beer
and
really
great
story
behind
worth
the
shot
and
experience
o
too
sweet
for
me
i
guess
this
might
be
a
nice
dessert
offering
like
a
dessert
wine
but
im
not
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
this
is
a
beer
that
you
only
wantneed
to
sip
a
small
amount
to
enjoy
update
4113
tastings
subsequent
to
this
review
found
the
beer
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
and
syrupy
scoring
adjusted
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
try
enjoy
and
enjoy
again
and
its
pretty
damn
cheap
too
go
get
some
o
interesting
silky
spicy
beer
with
a
derived
woody
characteristic
that
makes
it
delightfully
complex
its
really
hard
to
believe
this
is
9
abv
doesnt
show
not
an
everyday
beer
but
an
interesting
bottle
to
bring
to
a
dinner
party
or
to
buy
and
ponder
over
o
interesting
beer
the
winelike
characteristics
really
make
this
brew
special
o
35
although
i
do
lean
toward
tripels
and
ipas
it
was
worth
trying
but
not
one
of
dogfish
heads
better
beers
there
is
too
much
grape
giving
a
wine
taste
without
a
sweet
finish
the
carbonation
was
the
most
pleasant
part
of
the
glass
o
an
interesting
beer
tastes
like
a
winebeer
hybrid
definitely
an
odd
taste
but
one
that
really
works
it
goes
down
easily
with
regard
to
its
gravity
overall
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
fantastic
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
unbalanced
in
the
beginning
it
tastes
more
like
a
beer
that
then
seems
to
turn
into
a
boozy
wine
it
has
some
very
nice
individual
characteristics
yet
the
transitions
of
them
from
one
to
another
dont
really
make
for
a
smooth
drinking
experience
other
than
the
color
saffron
gets
lost
in
the
overall
complexity
of
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
one
of
the
recipes
that
just
works
you
would
think
on
paper
that
is
would
not
be
a
very
strong
concept
but
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
sweet
crisp
lite
tannin
notes
and
a
delicious
skunky
herd
overtone
that
is
adjusted
harmoniously
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
55
for
a
sweet
beer
this
is
far
from
overwhelming
i
think
the
sweetness
is
at
the
right
balance
ive
tasted
many
other
sweet
beers
that
really
put
me
off
but
not
here
this
beer
is
chill
haze
away
from
being
perfect
o
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
found
it
pretty
bland
and
not
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
however
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
there
was
a
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and
fruitiness
in
this
beer
although
it
could
have
maybe
used
a
little
bit
more
the
muscat
grapes
definitely
gave
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
white
wine
quality
if
you
appreciate
white
wines
then
you
will
probably
appreciate
this
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
an
easy
drinker
and
at
9
its
not
a
lightweight
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
but
id
have
to
space
them
this
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
some
light
foam
theres
an
obvious
grape
aroma
muscat
but
also
something
more
akin
to
champagne
tastes
light
more
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
honestly
although
this
doesnt
sound
flattering
it
reminds
me
of
sweet
white
grape
juice
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
negative
way
it
just
has
the
similar
flavor
profile
in
my
mind
effervescent
nuanced
and
enjoyable
o
very
delicious
beer
very
different
than
anything
ive
tasted
wow
im
so
glad
ive
discovered
dogfish
head
beers
this
was
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
and
just
the
right
amount
of
everything
else
truly
a
great
beer
o
delicious
suggestive
of
a
belgian
light
o
midas
touch
is
a
unique
beer
give
it
a
try
and
see
wha
tour
ancestors
liked
strong
drink
that
goes
down
easy
i
enjoy
trying
experimental
beers
and
kudos
for
going
outside
the
box
i
just
dont
feel
its
working
this
time
meh
o
its
far
from
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
something
everyone
should
try
but
for
the
price
tag
a
would
not
pay
for
this
myself
overall
this
is
a
pretty
cool
brew
it
reminds
me
of
the
otter
creek
qvh
and
the
dogfish
theobroma
the
brews
themselves
arent
so
incredible
that
i
lose
sleep
but
they
are
pretty
awesome
interpretations
of
very
unique
styles
a
different
beer
when
i
started
i
thought
this
would
be
a
one
time
thing
but
i
can
see
myself
trying
it
again
although
its
more
of
a
late
summerautumn
beer
for
me
o
not
bad
the
grapes
are
interesting
for
a
beer
though
othis
is
certainly
not
your
average
beer
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
overall
a
truly
unique
beer
and
an
excellent
sipper
deceptively
drinkable
for
its
abv
can
dogfish
head
do
any
wrong
overall
a
very
interesting
and
a
very
unique
ale
but
my
marveling
over
its
greatness
stops
there
i
was
not
impressed
by
it
there
were
some
very
overwhelming
and
offputting
characters
to
this
beer
perhaps
with
time
this
kind
of
beer
will
become
more
appealing
to
my
taste
but
for
now
i
am
having
a
hard
time
getting
into
it
enough
to
return
for
any
other
reason
than
the
concept
overall
its
not
my
favorite
by
dogfish
though
i
really
like
the
idea
behind
their
ancient
ale
series
its
very
drinkable
and
would
be
awesome
on
a
hot
summer
night
with
some
friends
the
pour
had
little
to
no
head
that
dissipated
to
a
minimal
layer
the
smell
was
sweet
reminding
me
of
honey
and
sugar
the
first
taste
was
a
little
different
than
what
i
expected
sweet
with
a
dry
aftertaste
an
okay
beer
enjoyable
one
that
was
recommended
that
i
at
least
try
but
not
one
that
i
will
run
out
to
buy
again
other
comments
i
cant
say
i
detect
any
grapes
in
this
glad
i
finally
tried
it
but
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
it
again
at
least
not
go
out
of
my
way
the
sweetness
is
cloying
but
in
a
very
small
way
dont
know
if
id
wanna
drink
the
whole
4
pack
but
i
could
def
be
down
with
at
least
2
of
these
for
a
nice
night
at
a
sushi
restaurant
serving
type
bottle
ive
been
enjoying
this
off
and
on
for
years
it
was
such
an
eye
opener
when
it
first
came
out
i
think
you
really
havent
lived
until
youve
tried
it
this
is
one
of
the
classics
that
makes
modern
craft
brew
so
fascinating
overall
impression
a
rough
brew
to
drink
my
first
from
dogfish
head
that
i
didnt
enjoy
to
the
fullest
im
hoping
the
next
dogfish
head
brew
i
go
for
or
receive
as
an
extra
will
be
more
fulfilling
dont
recommend
this
one
below
average
and
definitely
not
a
fun
one
to
start
out
the
night
o
great
beer
from
dfh
its
a
fun
one
that
is
really
enjoyable
too
ill
have
to
get
more
the
taste
is
very
unique
and
distinct
it
has
a
lot
of
qualities
not
typically
found
in
beer
but
still
retains
a
strong
beerlike
presence
its
a
bit
sour
in
the
way
that
sour
apples
or
sour
grapes
are
sour
not
the
green
apple
taste
of
a
poorly
brewed
beer
this
actually
compliments
the
beer
quite
nicely
it
has
a
honey
flavour
as
well
and
despite
my
usual
aversion
to
honey
this
flavour
compliments
the
beer
quite
nicely
there
are
some
hops
and
other
spices
that
balance
out
the
beer
very
well
i
cant
place
what
the
spices
are
the
bottle
says
saffron
im
not
an
herb
expert
so
i
dont
know
what
saffron
tastes
like
maybe
thats
whats
making
this
beer
so
awesome
the
hops
are
light
but
present
enough
to
give
the
beer
just
the
light
astringency
it
needs
overall
the
beer
is
sweet
and
light
in
flavour
and
the
alcohol
character
is
quite
discernible
which
i
like
but
no
so
harsh
that
most
beer
drinkers
might
have
a
problem
with
it
i
personally
like
an
alcohol
presence
in
my
beer
so
i
welcome
lots
of
strongly
alcoholflavoured
beers
id
consider
this
one
to
have
a
medium
alcohol
character
its
not
overbearing
basically
this
beer
is
fucking
sweet
if
you
have
the
funds
and
the
availability
try
it
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
in
flavor
and
backstory
o
tastes
a
lot
like
a
high
abv
lager
with
white
grape
mixed
in
maybe
best
described
as
a
winelager
cocktail
i
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
so
lagery
its
interesting
but
not
something
id
have
again
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
head
i
like
the
unfiltered
look
and
bright
gold
complexion
the
nose
was
stronger
than
id
been
expecting
after
reading
some
other
reviews
and
different
in
its
fruity
malt
odor
than
most
other
beers
im
used
to
strong
fruity
flavors
deriving
from
the
hops
but
a
first
taste
reveals
a
smooth
fruit
malt
backbone
instead
of
a
flavor
balance
provided
by
hops
the
malt
counterpoint
instead
seems
to
be
the
champagnelike
aspect
built
into
this
beer
thus
the
grape
and
honey
promised
on
the
bottle
appear
but
not
in
a
sweet
fashion
as
in
a
dry
champagne
much
to
my
delight
the
honey
almost
manifests
in
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
which
is
light
and
crisp
but
full
like
a
golden
alechampagne
cross
overall
excellent
and
i
cannot
recall
a
beer
of
this
style
that
i
would
recommend
any
higher
well
done
dogfish
head
overall
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
with
a
floral
taste
and
fruits
in
a
pretty
good
combination
you
will
tend
to
love
midas
touch
despite
not
smelling
like
much
it
makes
up
in
every
other
category
cheers
to
all
and
hope
you
all
enjoy
overall
this
beer
is
decent
ive
tried
it
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
at
the
same
time
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overallnot
a
bad
little
beer
pretty
solid
tastes
good
something
nice
to
sip
on
overall
for
my
dollar
very
overpriced
i
could
get
camo
for
16
the
price
not
that
id
want
to
mind
you
but
i
could
thanks
to
wyatt
for
this
one
bodyvery
active
effervescence
on
the
tongue
pretty
light
almost
chalky
but
not
unpleasant
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
this
is
really
good
stuff
good
for
slow
sipping
and
also
after
dinner
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
it
a
combination
of
dessert
and
a
nice
drink
though
not
that
sweet
would
get
it
again
even
for
the
price
without
question
truly
an
individual
nothing
ive
tried
quite
like
it
pretty
unique
but
i
dont
think
ill
try
this
one
again
o
very
crisp
and
clean
beer
with
abv
very
well
hidden
i
would
recommend
this
beer
yellowish
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
head
not
much
aroma
to
this
offering
fruit
flavor
up
front
and
along
with
another
sweet
undertone
that
is
difficult
to
place
and
slightly
unpleasant
this
is
an
interesting
concept
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
repeat
or
recommend
overall
how
to
put
this
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
glad
dfh
took
the
time
and
effort
to
brew
it
and
that
they
keep
boldly
trying
new
things
really
not
going
to
be
stocking
up
on
this
one
though
most
likely
a
oneanddone
for
me
just
thankful
it
wasnt
a
drainpour
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
of
belgian
dubbels
minus
the
yeast
this
is
a
great
experimental
beer
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
interesting
ingredients
and
no
hops
pours
a
golden
honeylike
color
into
my
glass
with
no
head
at
all
aroma
of
grapes
honey
and
saffron
taste
follows
the
nose
tasty
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
i
couldnt
drink
this
every
day
but
man
is
this
a
nice
treat
a
great
beer
overall
o
somewhat
intriguing
though
not
a
home
run
by
any
means
probably
could
not
put
down
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
or
every
couple
months
all
4s
is
kind
of
boring
i
know
this
is
kind
of
unremarkable
interesting
but
not
ground
breaking
good
but
not
excellent
interesting
smells
like
a
freshly
opened
box
of
breakfast
cereal
but
its
rather
weak
and
doesnt
really
impress
decent
but
not
a
doorbuster
appearance
well
very
little
bubbling
little
lacing
and
an
absent
head
it
is
apricot
yelloworange
great
taste
white
grapes
sugars
very
spicy
saffron
is
very
present
not
alot
of
hops
for
dfh
but
rather
tasty
nonetheless
the
saffron
is
real
interesting
to
find
in
a
beer
quite
unique
if
you
are
a
fan
of
dfh
this
is
one
to
try
likewise
if
you
are
a
fan
of
spicy
beer
overall
i
so
wanted
what
was
on
tap
the
bottle
is
but
a
shadow
overall
pretty
decent
as
far
as
balance
and
creativity
but
im
pretty
sure
i
wont
be
pickin
this
up
anytime
soon
another
strange
and
ambiguous
brew
from
dfh
o
solid
beer
wasnt
too
excited
by
the
smell
or
look
of
it
at
first
interesting
flavors
that
arent
overwhelming
a
pear
like
honey
and
yeast
like
aroma
very
intricate
golden
orange
appearance
with
a
head
dispersal
to
the
rim
tastes
of
honey
the
muscat
grapes
leave
an
impression
almost
like
a
honeydew
melon
wine
palate
is
medium
creamy
and
soft
to
no
carbonation
finish
is
long
and
sweet
very
complex
and
satisfying
i
will
finish
in
favor
of
the
9
abv
o
quite
pleasant
not
a
lot
of
wow
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
exotic
from
a
2700yearold
beer
recipe
but
definitely
drinkable
and
it
paired
well
with
broiled
chicken
i
had
for
dinner
o
an
enjoyable
beer
86
o
surprisingly
good
although
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
bad
from
dogfish
the
ingredients
caught
my
eye
as
a
possible
poor
choice
this
is
a
great
light
beer
that
would
go
great
on
a
warn
summer
night
a
child
between
a
beer
and
a
white
wine
the
light
sweetness
goes
well
with
the
perfectly
dry
finish
while
the
malt
still
lingers
i
would
definitely
recommend
everyone
to
at
least
trying
a
bottle
even
if
the
style
wouldnt
be
everyones
thing
this
beer
is
great
being
from
ct
and
living
on
li
its
hard
to
find
this
beer
my
girlfriend
and
i
were
up
in
ct
this
weekend
and
found
a
4
pack
at
ct
beverage
im
happy
this
beer
still
exists
i
used
to
be
able
to
get
it
at
my
current
place
of
work
port
jefferson
beverage
but
there
are
apparently
shortages
i
wish
that
they
could
brew
more
it
upsets
me
that
they
leave
us
hanging
overall
this
is
a
cool
beer
but
it
comes
off
a
little
more
like
wine
than
beer
the
grapes
are
a
little
heavy
and
between
the
grapes
and
honey
theres
a
little
too
much
sweetness
its
different
and
definitely
offcentered
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
or
if
youre
a
big
dfh
fan
it
has
a
slick
fairly
thick
feel
i
think
is
a
decent
beer
with
an
interesting
story
ill
keep
a
few
bottles
around
overall
obviously
a
treat
for
those
of
us
outside
dfhs
distribution
range
this
is
also
just
a
treat
of
a
beer
i
think
its
perfect
for
a
just
one
sort
of
occasion
before
or
after
a
meal
on
a
sunny
afternoon
as
a
nightcap
or
maybe
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
the
beer
is
light
drinkable
but
with
a
big
character
and
a
heavier
hit
than
a
first
sip
reveals
a
great
fusion
of
many
styles
that
with
such
a
semblance
to
wine
falls
outside
many
beer
styles
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
sam
o
after
half
the
glass
the
sweetness
becomes
somewhat
overpowering
and
distracting
hard
to
finish
o
excellent
if
you
have
not
had
midas
touch
it
is
a
must
even
if
spice
beers
are
not
your
thing
or
wine
for
that
matter
this
beverage
is
a
must
try
a
very
nice
approach
of
something
different
or
ancient
thats
why
we
all
love
dogfish
overall
this
one
is
really
great
i
get
this
one
pretty
frequently
and
it
pairs
great
with
sweet
and
sour
pork
and
saffron
rice
all
in
all
its
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
pick
it
up
again
if
i
were
midas
a
few
thousand
years
ago
i
might
say
this
is
incredible
but
then
again
king
midas
probably
didnt
have
a
choice
your
majesty
may
i
suggest
a
dfh
90min
ipa
this
is
not
your
average
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
an
every
now
and
then
drink
its
just
extremely
well
done
ive
heard
it
described
as
somewhere
between
a
beer
wine
and
a
mead
this
is
exactly
accurate
and
an
amazing
example
of
what
you
can
do
with
beer
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
world
of
unique
and
different
beers
and
for
that
i
am
very
grateful
thank
you
sam
and
dfh
overall
midas
touch
is
a
unique
and
tasty
beer
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
reach
for
every
time
but
i
will
reach
for
it
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
spice
and
unusual
fruit
flavors
work
remarkably
well
together
this
is
a
great
beer
the
colour
is
a
clear
golden
i
was
quite
surprised
that
this
was
9
alcohol
it
goes
down
remarkably
smooth
i
defiantly
get
the
hint
of
grape
and
honey
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bitter
after
taste
which
i
dont
mind
at
all
the
smell
i
got
from
it
was
a
musty
sweetness
reminds
me
of
a
white
wine
scent
i
couldnt
taste
the
saffron
but
i
could
see
it
having
some
influence
in
the
colour
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
for
sure
well
put
together
enjoyable
solidly
in
the
good
range
the
grapes
and
saffron
does
not
point
out
wich
was
a
small
disapointment
but
its
a
really
good
beer
anyways
taste
presents
very
much
the
same
strong
grape
flavors
and
honey
even
a
bit
of
bitterness
a
hint
of
spiciness
that
i
guess
comes
from
the
saffron
its
like
drinking
a
carbonated
chadonnay
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
regular
beer
flavor
coming
from
the
barley
medium
bodied
witha
slick
oily
buttery
mouthfeel
its
actually
a
pretty
fun
beer
to
try
not
something
i
could
drink
too
any
of
but
its
interesting
and
its
good
its
worth
a
try
every
once
in
awhile
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
and
while
i
did
enjoy
it
i
am
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
i
would
not
shy
away
from
having
more
pours
a
hazy
golden
peach
like
color
with
good
lacing
around
the
beer
smells
of
honey
citrus
white
wine
and
spice
tastes
of
bread
honeywine
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
for
being
a
9
abv
they
did
a
good
job
of
masking
it
i
will
be
buying
some
more
of
this
stuff
cheers
o
having
never
smelt
or
tasted
saffron
this
one
isnt
living
up
to
its
potential
much
more
appreciated
now
than
when
i
had
my
first
bottle
of
this
last
summer
overall
an
very
good
beer
that
has
some
interesting
characteristics
but
this
reviewer
thinks
it
better
as
a
history
exercise
than
a
truly
drinkable
beer
2010
bottle
in
the
hotel
room
in
dc
pours
a
hazy
deep
golden
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
malty
and
grain
forward
very
light
herbal
spice
with
some
fruuity
esters
as
well
flavour
is
similar
sweet
gritty
barley
dry
white
vinous
grapes
honey
and
alcohol
hated
this
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
now
i
really
like
it
this
would
be
an
awesome
fall
beer
pours
a
pale
opaque
gold
color
with
little
head
in
the
tulip
glass
notes
of
coriander
honey
and
lavender
not
much
to
speak
of
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
light
in
the
mouth
with
little
carbonation
which
is
an
interesting
combination
serious
lack
of
malt
almost
like
a
lager
strong
grape
taste
which
fades
to
alcohol
to
light
herby
flavor
bitter
aftertaste
is
the
only
hint
of
hops
in
this
nectar
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
beer
or
a
mead
its
so
sweet
but
the
bitterness
at
the
end
really
saves
it
this
would
be
good
in
100
degree
weather
but
im
not
sure
if
its
something
to
keep
on
the
shelf
for
regular
use
like
most
dfh
brews
this
isnt
much
more
than
a
curiosity
future
outlook
ill
throw
a
few
downstairs
to
forget
about
for
a
long
time
and
see
if
a
magical
transformation
takes
place
overall
drinkability
depends
what
youre
in
the
mood
this
beer
has
a
big
kick
in
the
middle
so
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
its
not
quite
on
the
excellent
scale
but
it
is
a
remarkable
brew
and
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
not
one
i
would
drink
every
day
but
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
hazy
straw
like
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
musty
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bready
with
a
little
spice
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
taste
first
of
alcohol
then
a
little
sweetness
maybe
some
honey
ripe
fruit
and
spice
not
much
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
okay
not
one
ill
get
again
someone
told
me
its
the
direct
opposite
of
their
palo
santo
and
i
think
that
pretty
true
a
little
too
sweet
different
for
my
taste
overall
the
taste
is
unique
and
not
in
a
bad
way
but
also
not
in
an
exciting
way
either
a
nice
beer
to
try
out
but
my
biggest
issue
is
that
this
beer
gets
old
fast
and
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
stale
wine
then
beer
this
one
pours
a
see
through
golden
copper
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
fast
vanishing
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell

sweet

and
finished
with
a
warm
sweet
candy
syrupy
finish
and
overall
i
found
this
drop
very
sweet
and
the
high
abv
very
well
hidden
so
it
definately
would
suit
desert
cheeses
but
lacks
a
herbal
hoppy
punch
for
me
and
probably
would
not
revisit
anytime
soon
as
i
like
my
hops
overall
like
a
perfumy
golden
bock
none
of
us
all
that
impressed
with
it
but
i
wouldnt
pass
up
the
chance
to
try
it
again
it
seems
like
each
successive
time
i
drink
it
the
flavor
improves
or
maybe
im
more
able
to
discern
its
subtle
taste
interesting
and
enjoyable
while
definitely
unique
remarkably
drinkable
ogreat
beer
very
interesting
and
another
unique
beer
from
dogfish
head
very
drinkable
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
beer
experience
just
wish
it
werent
as
pricey
as
it
is
o
very
unique
beer
it
is
good
and
could
be
a
beer
to
sip
on
a
warm
summer
day
its
refreshing
even
though
the
high
avb
ooverall
i
really
like
this
beer
never
tasted
one
like
this
which
makes
it
interesting
and
unforgetable
o
while
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
interesting
after
a
while
i
stopped
finding
it
entirely
enjoyable
great
for
12oz
but
after
that
meh
overall
very
unique
style
its
nectarlike
qualities
make
it
complex
and
pleasant
to
drink
abv
is
good
yet
not
overpowering
either
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
a
heavy
body
and
chewy
heavy
feel
this
is
a
slow
sipper
that
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
probably
my
least
favorite
tastiing
dogfish
head
beer
to
date
the
aging
may
have
made
this
even
more
like
an
old
time
beer
which
while
clever
didnt
do
much
for
the
flavor
to
me
and
made
it
almost
seem
stale
o
good
beer
but
it
cant
quite
justify
the
price
i
wont
refuse
this
beer
from
a
friend
but
im
not
sure
if
i
will
purchase
again
in
the
near
future
overall
really
nice
i
enjoyed
having
an
09
thats
had
a
little
time
to
cone
into
its
own
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
hazy
orange
color
body
with
a
little
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
of
grapes
and
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
starts
off
a
little
weird
i
get
some
honey
taste
then
a
raisin
like
on
the
back
and
a
spicy
finish
mouth
feel
is
ok
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
great
brew
much
more
beer
like
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
good
thing
very
dangerous
at
9
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
im
wondering
what
this
would
be
with
some
wild
bugs
in
the
mix
would
be
a
good
idea
as
the
original
definitely
had
some
funk
overall
a
fine
brew
descriptions
on
their
website
and
elsewhere
lead
me
to
believe
this
brew
would
be
a
little
more
on
the
mead
or
wine
side
but
it
turned
out
to
be
very
much
a
light
bodied
beer
terrifyingly
sessionable
tasty
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
taste
is
like
a
lightbodied
lager
in
its
refreshing
character
but
the
aroma
lets
you
know
how
much
effort
those
yeast
and
their
masters
put
into
it
worth
a
try
but
be
careful
few
9
beers
are
this
easy
too
drink
o
another
beer
that
surprised
me
as
to
how
enjoyable
it
was
will
definitely
have
again
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
recommend
all
beer
drinkers
to
try
it
just
to
get
a
taste
of
the
old
world
this
beer
probably
seemed
like
a
good
idea
but
i
thought
it
was
really
awful
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
o
id
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
and
can
picture
it
taking
the
place
of
reisling
or
other
sweet
wines
on
my
dinner
table
its
gonna
rock
with
spicy
thai
food
ive
gotta
grab
some
of
this
for
my
reisling
loving
mom
shes
gonna
flip
for
this
i
went
with
an
aggressive
pour
since
no
directions
were
given
on
the
bottle
plus
i
did
not
see
any
lees
in
evidence
i
had
a
rocky
finger
of
offwhite
head
briefly
until
it
went
back
into
the
ages
from
whence
it
came
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
that
would
have
made
king
midas
proud
to
have
it
named
after
him
plus
he
would
be
able
to
see
well
into
the
future
with
this
one
i
definitely
caught
the
grape
vinousness
on
the
nose
but
also
the
honey
sweetness
as
well
as
a
dry
mustiness
no
doubt
the
result
of
the
yeast
mouthfeel
was
very
viscous
not
honeythick
but
full
for
beer
and
with
an
effervescence
that
seemed
to
wash
my
mouth
clean
on
the
second
mouthful
following
midas
cleansing
i
was
getting
a
definite
white
wine
dryness
along
with
an
underlying
honey
sweetness
man
i
may
need
a
laydown
after
this
finish
had
a
unique
honeygrapemalt
admixture
that
swirled
around
in
the
back
of
my
throat
it
was
a
mellow
beer
for
its
given
abv
and
that
may
be
its
only
drawback
it
is
too
smooth
to
lay
on
the
unsuspecting
and
even
the
more
seasoned
veterans
may
be
caught
unawares
i
suddenly
began
to
feel
it
coming
on
like
a
freight
train
zounds
overall
i
still
enjoy
this
in
the
taste
and
drink
ive
had
this
many
times
before
but
i
think
i
needed
a
fresher
bottle
or
just
go
for
on
tap
i
seem
to
remember
liking
it
more
in
the
past
perhaps
a
rereview
is
in
the
cards
for
this
one
o
good
but
not
great
worth
trying
but
not
an
everyday
drinker
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
although
i
still
thought
it
was
a
great
brew
as
is
to
be
expected
from
dogfish
head
at
first
site
with
a
nice
somewhat
strong
head
but
later
to
be
paired
with
a
mediocure
appearance
overall
i
expected
more
from
midas
touch
the
first
inhale
was
of
a
deep
honey
mixed
with
a
little
spice
i
expected
the
barley
to
be
one
of
the
main
features
of
this
beer
but
along
the
lines
of
the
3rd
sip
quickly
realized
this
was
a
beer
and
white
wine
match
made
in
heaven
from
my
personal
beer
preference
it
was
flat
out
just
too
winey
for
my
liking
a
giant
fan
of
dogfish
at
heart
but
this
one
is
definitely
60
90
minutes
apart
from
the
ipa
overall
this
is
a
very
onedimensional
beer
and
that
dimension
just
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
o
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
like
white
wine
and
this
is
very
much
like
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
white
wine
had
gotten
this
beer
for
the
first
time
on
tap
a
tthe
brewery
after
the
tour
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
crystle
clear
golden
yellow
brew
with
a
pretty
nice
looking
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
minimal
but
not
bad
the
smell
of
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
fresh
white
grape
aromas
in
the
nose
its
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
had
the
same
sweetness
on
the
nose
had
some
very
subtle
spice
flavors
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
i
think
overall
this
beer
could
be
seen
as
a
braggot
or
something
similar
a
spiced
ale
is
fitting
as
well
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
in
small
quantity
very
tasty
stuff
overall
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
beer
very
easy
to
drink
even
at
9
abv
i
will
purchase
again
and
try
aging
some
as
well
mouthfeelthis
is
a
good
quality
to
the
beer
just
above
medium
bodied
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
well
and
suits
the
beer
well
overall
this
is
a
middling
brew
moderately
enjoyable
though
dogfish
head
churns
out
some
much
better
stuff
imo
good
at
best
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
delicious
while
somewhat
thin
in
body
and
not
overly
aromatic
i
thought
it
was
delicious
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
my
girlfriend
loves
it
i
dont
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
weighs
in
at
9
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
dryness
aside
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
gently
carbonated
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
the
9
alcohol
is
absolutely
100
masked
and
thisd
drink
as
easily
as
an
american
pale
wheat
if
it
werent
so
damn
sweet
overall
this
is
a
good
and
unique
beer
thats
just
a
bit
away
from
being
great
its
just
too
sweet
to
be
a
fullbore
favourite
but
ill
probably
still
pick
up
singles
of
this
every
once
in
a
while
o
an
interesting
beer
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
you
can
tell
this
is
a
high
alcohol
beer
not
something
id
probably
pick
up
again
but
worth
the
try
it
has
a
mouthfeel
very
similar
to
a
miller
lite
which
i
dont
think
is
a
real
beer
and
overall
just
doesnt
work
for
me
like
i
said
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
dfh
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
but
hey
the
girl
i
date
likes
it
so
maybe
its
just
me
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
retains
and
laces
very
well
the
aroma
has
strong
notes
of
floral
and
honey
the
taste
starts
malty
sweet
then
becomes
floral
then
has
hints
of
honey
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
overall
a
very
unique
beer
that
doesnt
conform
to
the
usual
types
i
would
definitely
recommend
o
ummp
ok
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
clear
honeyamber
colorthe
low
carbonation
produces
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quicklybut
leaves
some
lacing
the
nose
has
a
herbal
quality
with
scents
of
honeynotes
of
banana
and
spices
honey
flavor
is
right
up
front
with
sweet
grapes
following
behind
there
is
also
a
nice
spiciness
on
the
tongueand
a
bready
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
and
somewhat
oily
this
beer
has
almost
no
bitterness
but
somehow
avoids
being
overly
sweet
and
it
hides
the
relatively
high
abv
very
well
not
an
everyday
brew
for
mebut
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
must
applaud
dfh
on
turning
back
time
and
bringing
this
one
back
from
history
a
good
mix
of
creativity
and
knowledge
proves
that
not
all
beers
need
a
ton
of
hops
to
pull
off
quality
overall
this
is
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
for
me
regardless
of
the
high
alcohol
content
which
the
beer
hides
decently
its
just
got
such
a
unique
and
out
there
flavor
that
its
a
little
hard
to
drink
tastes
pretty
good
and
maybe
with
some
food
the
rather
annoying
dry
bitterness
would
subside
but
on
its
own
the
weird
bitterness
is
pretty
tough
o
overall
this
beer
is
worth
the
try
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
on
this
one
but
it
wasnt
bad
pretty
decent
o
decent
brew
although
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
worth
trying
out
once
though
the
beer
is
good
the
beer
is
very
good
i
cant
quite
give
it
a
perfect
rating
here
but
its
close
there
needs
to
be
more
on
the
aftertaste
for
me
to
go
for
a
perfect
score
regardless
its
delicious
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
brew
again
well
done
dogfish
well
done
cant
picture
having
more
than
one
notes
great
with
any
dinner
or
a
night
cap
beer
truly
should
be
in
your
weekly
rotation
if
you
have
one
dogfish
has
done
it
again
oc
o
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
it
has
a
unique
flavor
with
a
kind
alcohol
punch
a
nice
sipping
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
visible
carbonation
it
comes
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
my
glass
no
lacing
is
present
the
smell
is
of
grapes
and
an
odd
sweetness
i
cant
pin
down
taste
is
less
potent
than
i
expected
up
front
i
get
that
honey
like
sweetness
then
the
white
wine
flavor
shows
up
in
the
middle
of
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
i
dont
think
ill
drink
this
often
but
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
have
the
taste
is
unique
and
i
am
impressed
at
how
well
it
hides
the
high
abv
o
an
interesting
beer
that
i
believe
is
bet
described
as
a
combo
whitewinebeer
it
is
different
and
i
would
try
it
again
poured
cloudy
goldenyellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
aroma
of
sweet
sugars
and
fruits
taste
of
white
wine
honey
grapes
and
cherries
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
for
balance
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
syrupiness
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
very
complex
and
tasty
extra
points
for
innovation
as
with
many
dfh
brews
this
used
to
be
among
my
favorites
when
i
first
started
my
journey
into
craft
beer
but
its
not
something
i
desire
to
drink
too
often
these
days
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lace
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overbearing
some
belgian
characteristics
for
sure
fruity
and
somewhat
vinous
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
honey
maybe
lightmedium
bodied
and
very
smooth
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
a
great
beer
im
surprised
it
doesnt
have
a
higher
average
rating
drinkability
decent
especially
for
the
abv
on
the
other
hand
this
is
expensive
and
at
9
you
cant
have
more
than
12
at
a
time
d
i
probably
wont
finish
the
beer
t
goes
down
sweet
and
smooth
lots
of
honey
and
white
grapelike
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
sourness
thats
very
reminiscent
of
wine
on
the
finish
bready
malts
and
some
yeast
come
in
the
mouthfeel
is
really
what
saves
this
one
if
it
was
a
bit
thicker
the
sweetness
would
be
overpowering
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
did
attempt
to
keep
this
review
somewhat
subjective
while
listening
to
my
personal
opinions
on
this
beer
i
still
gave
some
leniency
considering
this
beer
was
brewed
according
to
a
2700yearold
recipe
with
little
room
for
variance
by
the
brewer
the
smell
really
intrigued
me
kind
of
like
mead
with
a
little
bit
grape
and
malt
way
in
the
back
i
could
have
used
a
lot
more
hop
in
this
beer
it
was
kind
of
sweet
and
almost
bland
all
the
same
the
grape
and
honey
part
was
really
interesting
because
you
could
actually
taste
that
aspect
so
i
want
to
give
them
credit
for
at
least
that
unique
aspect
although
it
is
probably
my
least
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
i
also
tried
it
on
tap
at
howie
sons
a
few
weeks
later
and
it
tasted
a
little
less
sweet
with
the
extra
carbonation
but
it
just
didnt
change
my
mind
the
batches
varied
alot
it
seems
to
me
overall
this
is
a
white
wine
lovers
beer
and
almost
a
beer
lovers
wine
it
seemed
like
a
belgian
golden
ale
and
white
wine
mixed
together
interesting
flavors
though
not
one
i
would
return
to
often
overall
one
of
dogfish
heads
few
disappointments
it
was
drinkable
and
the
9
abv
was
well
concealed
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
probably
wouldnt
return
to
this
offering
from
dogfish
m
pretty
viscous
and
the
malthoneygrape
juice
backbone
provides
for
a
sticky
mouthfeel
after
each
sip
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
foamy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
smells
much
like
a
saison
or
some
other
lighter
spicy
brew
theres
saffron
grapes
and
honey
very
light
for
this
level
of
abv
hops
are
on
the
sweeter
side
interesting
but
not
my
deal
overall
a
good
beer
not
one
of
dogfishs
best
in
my
opinion
but
definitely
worth
trying
poured
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
an
average
amount
of
tight
white
head
great
lacing
on
this
beer
as
well
some
spice
and
malt
in
the
smell
maybe
a
little
honey
in
there
as
well
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
then
the
herbs
and
spices
come
on
in
the
finish
along
with
a
little
bitterness
as
well
this
is
an
intersting
beer
but
its
growing
on
me
medium
mouthfeel
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
despite
the
9
abv
and
spices
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
didnt
think
i
liked
it
at
first
but
by
halfway
through
it
grew
on
me
i
would
probably
try
this
again
but
not
until
its
available
in
wisconsin
again
overall
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
good
unique
brew
midas
touch
blurs
the
line
between
beer
wine
and
mead
there
were
a
lot
of
different
things
going
on
with
this
beer
that
made
it
pretty
complex
but
not
over
done
this
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
i
am
pretty
adventurous
beer
drinker
so
this
feeds
my
need
to
search
out
the
odd
and
unique
this
inst
a
beer
i
could
drink
more
then
one
of
or
keep
around
in
the
fridge
but
it
is
good
for
mixing
things
up
a
bit
and
i
feel
like
the
wine
like
qualitys
this
beer
has
would
appeal
to
women
if
you
like
unique
beers
and
enjoy
a
glass
of
mead
and
white
wine
on
occasion
then
this
brew
might
be
for
you
i
was
a
little
late
hopping
on
the
dogfish
head
train
but
i
am
really
starting
to
like
their
style
wonder
what
other
odd
beers
they
have
waiting
for
me
to
try
it
reminds
me
of
a
sauvignon
blanc
with
hops
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
dogfish
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
interested
in
the
whole
ancient
ale
thing
dnot
the
best
beer
that
dfh
has
to
offer
my
first
endeavor
into
their
ancient
ales
worth
a
try
buy
not
really
worth
the
price
of
a
4
pack
editafter
having
two
more
the
drinkability
is
not
the
same
level
as
other
dfh
products
the
spices
do
not
make
for
an
easily
sessionable
beer
o
an
interesting
combination
of
flavors
the
honey
gives
the
smell
a
sort
of
sweetness
not
often
found
in
beer
and
grapes
remind
one
of
wine
ive
also
tried
the
60
minute
ipa
from
dogfish
i
thought
it
seemed
good
for
what
it
was
but
ipas
are
one
of
the
few
beers
i
am
still
working
on
acquiring
a
taste
for
it
was
pretty
good
though
which
help
influence
me
to
grab
this
one
i
am
happy
i
did
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
so
like
i
said
this
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
dfh
but
it
was
intriguing
enough
that
i
will
enjoy
drinking
the
other
three
bottles
from
the
four
pack
d
4
a
hair
more
of
the
grapes
than
id
prefer
has
me
thinking
wine
and
not
beer
at
moments
but
there
is
just
enough
going
on
otherwise
to
keep
me
interested
and
generally
enjoying
this
brew
it
is
certainly
different
like
a
lot
of
dfh
brews
but
i
like
it
at
9
abv
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
it
is
a
little
pricey
nonetheless
ill
likely
buy
it
again
its
something
i
could
enjoy
every
once
in
awhile
thanks
sam
overall
a
nice
selection
i
think
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
abv
the
high
alcohol
really
compliments
the
other
flavors
considering
this
is
year
round
brew
i
expected
a
more
complex
taste
not
that
this
is
flavorless
but
id
prefer
a
spicier
tripel
as
appose
to
this
sweet
style
nothing
much
left
to
say
just
wasnt
mind
blowing
as
i
anticipated
stay
thirsty
my
friends
midas
touch
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
off
centered
ales
because
it
is
different
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
is
cliché
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
for
those
in
the
mood
for
something
different
or
looking
for
a
beer
to
give
to
wine
loving
friends
maybe
part
of
my
high
drinkability
score
is
due
to
a
near
religious
experience
i
had
trying
this
at
the
milton
tasting
room
while
on
one
of
the
best
vacations
of
my
life
but
i
am
totally
okay
with
that
o
just
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
have
had
this
a
few
times
and
just
cant
get
over
the
flavorsweetness
combination
it
does
taste
a
little
better
with
some
food
though
probably
because
the
food
mutes
some
of
the
sweetness
i
give
dfh
some
credit
for
making
this
though
i
really
do
like
the
concept
behind
it
overall
this
a
very
unique
beer
doesnt
really
fit
into
any
great
style
but
fits
well
into
just
about
any
white
wine
drinkers
bill
overall
excellent
id
happily
drink
four
of
these
and
call
it
a
night
it
would
take
all
night
to
drink
since
they
sip
so
slow
expensive
i
know
but
worth
it
for
a
special
occasion
into
a
tulip
glass
on
3
6
11
this
pours
a
very
clear
and
bright
amber
highlighted
gold
color
what
a
brilliant
shine
smell
is
that
of
an
earthy
and
tart
fruit
spice
perhaps
from
the
saffron
and
grapes
aroma
is
very
similar
to
a
crisp
and
sweet
white
wine
with
its
bright
malt
sweetness
a
moderate
and
crisp
body
lets
the
earthy
fruit
and
spice
play
on
the
palate
and
empty
on
a
delicate
honey
noted
finish
next
time
i
try
this
id
like
to
pair
it
with
a
light
salad
andor
a
mild
seafood
dish
this
is
also
an
ultra
cool
timemachine
into
the
ancient
past
bottled
1611
do
definitely
glad
this
comes
in
4packs
and
not
6packs
because
of
the
abv
id
be
in
trouble
with
the
latter
this
is
definitely
another
solid
brew
from
dfh
perhaps
it
was
the
particlar
bottle
and
considering
that
its
dfh
im
certainly
willing
to
take
a
second
chance
but
this
brew
was
much
more
sour
than
spicy
served
from
bottle
in
goblet
glass
at
refrigerator
temperature
pours
with
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
much
more
of
a
tart
young
wine
than
of
beer
quite
intriguing
flavor
is
extremely
complex
but
is
mostly
of
the
advertised
muscat
grapes
is
this
a
sparkling
wine
or
a
beer
after
a
few
sips
the
flavor
of
honey
emerges
subtly
adding
to
the
questions
surrounding
this
brew
given
the
9
abv
id
say
wine
not
necessarily
a
session
beer
but
not
one
to
pass
up
this
one
is
too
cool
to
miss
i
would
love
to
quaff
the
next
one
at
a
renaissance
faire
with
a
giant
turkey
leg
recommended
disappointed
i
swear
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
that
it
was
much
better
odd
but
all
4
bottles
in
this
pack
taste
the
same
complex
and
tasty
midas
touch
is
an
ancient
ale
that
transcends
contemporary
styles
superb
much
more
of
a
delicious
malt
to
this
offering
its
been
a
good
six
months
since
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
the
malts
and
grains
here
are
delicious
and
i
get
less
of
that
grape
taste
still
it
proves
to
be
sot
of
a
berrywine
type
beer
i
updated
my
review
for
taste
on
this
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
cant
wait
to
get
it
again
friends
really
liked
this
beer
too
after
drinking
this
and
a
dunkleweizen
i
definitely
have
to
go
for
a
hopbomb
in
about
30
minutes
poured
a
meager
14
head
which
almost
immediately
dissipated
to
nothing
hazy
honey
colored
smells
of
malt
and
honey
and
has
a
slightly
floral
or
herbal
smell
which
im
supposing
is
from
the
saffron
taste
is
basically
a
lager
with
honey
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
little
salty
so
hey
decent
beer
interesting
i
understand
its
based
on
a
historic
recipe
and
all
that
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
what
youve
basically
got
is
a
sweet
pale
beer
d
not
likely
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
flower
herb
adventure
gets
my
thumbs
up
d
this
is
pretty
good
drink
to
just
kick
back
with
the
fizzy
sweetness
gets
you
up
front
then
you
get
a
smooth
roasted
flavor
with
honey
quite
good
though
almost
almost
a
bit
too
sweet
up
front
for
a
beer
really
does
remind
you
of
a
wine
the
beer
is
bright
golden
with
a
tall
fluffy
head
smells
of
honey
grains
and
white
grapes
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
just
a
bit
tart
there
are
flavors
of
honey
bread
and
grape
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
sweetness
makes
my
cheeks
pucker
its
heavy
and
chewy
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
d
although
i
did
enjoy
the
history
behind
the
beer
and
the
different
style
using
grapes
barley
honey
and
saffron
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
beer
i
did
enjoy
trying
something
different
from
my
regular
ipas
but
mixing
white
wine
and
mead
together
not
my
thing
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
unless
i
wanted
to
use
it
to
teach
a
history
lesson
d
not
a
bad
drink
by
any
means
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
like
it
it
has
its
place
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
every
weekend
drink
another
dfh
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
were
unique
this
is
definitely
something
i
will
buy
again
an
offcentered
beer
for
sure
this
blurs
the
line
between
beer
champagne
and
wine
but
that
was
what
the
brewers
intended
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
has
a
great
story
behind
it
my
only
complaint
was
the
alcohol
seem
to
step
over
some
of
the
flavors
you
could
easily
pair
this
up
with
various
dishes
very
interesting
beer
ill
pair
the
rest
up
with
some
good
food
overall
i
thought
that
it
was
an
alright
beer
but
that
strong
steel
reserve
flavor
really
overpowers
the
complexity
of
what
they
have
going
on
here
i
really
liked
it
at
first
but
the
more
i
got
into
the
bottle
the
more
i
started
to
dislike
the
nasty
aftertaste
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
honestly
dont
think
id
ever
buy
this
again
especially
at
the
exorbitant
price
theyre
asking
for
it
this
elixir
pours
a
golden
huelight
straw
color
in
my
glass
the
head
was
a
one
finger
white
cloud
that
dissipated
quick
and
left
no
lace
i
pick
up
some
raisin
honey
a
bit
of
earth
and
grape
juice
in
the
nose
this
ale
leans
on
the
sweet
side
as
i
sip
the
raisins
present
themselves
again
and
it
has
some
white
wine
characteristics
honey
sweetness
all
the
way
through
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
i
dont
feel
they
are
needed
medium
body
medium
carbonation
round
out
the
brew
this
was
better
than
expected
after
reading
the
ingredients
listed
very
sweet
but
good
perhaps
a
wine
drinkers
gateway
to
the
better
beverage
d
great
beer
if
you
have
the
penny
spend
it
for
this
unique
experience
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
appreciate
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
interestingly
a
bit
more
spicy
on
tap
that
from
the
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
very
small
fizzy
head
that
fully
dissapated
and
had
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
light
cereal
malts
piney
hops
and
a
doughy
yeast
with
mild
notes
of
grapes
honey
and
spices
it
tasted
bitter
and
mildly
sweet
at
first
and
ended
with
a
bitter
acidic
flavor
with
hints
of
grapes
and
had
a
strong
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
oily
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
ale
drinkability
too
sweet
to
enjoy
a
second
the
high
abv
is
not
masked
at
all
and
leaves
a
somewhat
unpleasant
alcoholsolvent
note
in
the
aftertaste
d
overall
another
fine
concoction
from
dogfish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
original
and
flavorful
packs
a
good
punch
of
unique
flavors
i
would
have
another
for
sure
d
smoothness
allows
this
brew
to
go
down
easily
not
too
heavy
sweetness
keeps
it
from
being
sessionworthy
but
overall
a
great
beer
to
drink
midas
touch
is
a
very
unique
beer
indeed
the
taste
is
bitter
at
first
but
not
overly
bitter
then
it
changes
to
a
sweet
honeylike
sensation
paired
with
the
grapes
and
saffron
the
finish
of
midas
touch
is
really
smooth
for
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
i
really
love
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
im
quite
disappointed
with
this
brew
from
dogfish
head
since
i
like
just
about
all
of
their
beers
what
a
letdown
d
well
its
not
bad
tasting
but
the
harshness
of
the
mouthfeel
and
the
abv
slow
you
down
a
bit
all
around
a
good
beer
its
not
on
my
short
list
of
must
haves
but
enjoyable
no
less
12
oz
into
a
snifter
this
should
be
interesting
color
is
not
what
i
expected
not
sure
what
i
expected
but
its
a
fairly
normal
color
not
a
huge
head
wow
i
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
its
also
exceptionally
sweet
im
not
going
to
accuse
it
of
being
unbalanced
however
because
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
i
respect
the
brewers
efforts
to
recraft
a
historical
beverage
not
one
i
can
drink
two
of
in
a
row
but
recommended
to
try
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
grapes
and
a
small
spice
in
the
taste
dry
fruit
mainly
grapes
and
spicy
a
spice
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
adry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
quite
spicy
and
lots
of
fruitiness
interesting
but
just
ok
dogfish
is
a
great
brewery
d
strange
beer
but
really
good
to
try
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
have
yet
to
sample
it
drinkability
i
hate
this
part
of
the
review
you
could
potentially
drink
a
6
pack
if
thats
what
youre
in
to
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
taste
very
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
for
9
abv
still
the
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
bright
golden
peach
orange
body
and
head
is
a
tad
thin
but
lacing
is
really
sticky
i
am
actually
getting
more
of
a
really
sweet
non
bitter
pineapple
like
dipa
on
the
nose
smells
really
sweet
and
not
bitter
or
hoppy
at
all
i
am
also
picking
up
a
bit
of
the
grapes
i
am
picking
up
several
things
in
the
taste
first
off
there
actually
does
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
on
the
backend
i
get
lager
like
cereal
white
grapes
and
the
honey
is
not
so
prominent
to
me
mouthfeel
is
very
slick
and
oily
almost
kind
of
sludgy
quality
the
only
downside
for
me
is
the
heat
this
is
one
big
alcohol
burn
overall
i
expected
not
to
like
this
wasnt
near
the
overly
sweet
mess
i
was
expecting
actually
thought
it
was
pretty
well
rounded
and
crafted
doesnt
taste
too
abnormal
to
me
at
all
d
this
was
my
gateway
to
craft
beer
and
i
still
drink
it
regularly
maybe
for
the
purpose
of
nostalgia
also
not
the
cheapest
beer
available
so
thats
another
knock
but
if
i
could
find
it
on
tap
im
sure
id
drink
more
drinks
average
not
super
anxious
to
have
this
one
again
but
its
pretty
good
anyway
overall
a
nice
beer
very
different
from
the
norm
which
is
also
good
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
yeast
grape
juice
and
bready
malt
full
tangy
body
taste
is
of
bready
malt
sweet
honey
some
grapes
herbal
hops
and
alcohol
massive
long
dry
finish
strong
unusual
brew
it
must
be
made
by
dogfish
head
cheers
drinkability
is
great
i
feel
like
i
havent
drank
as
much
as
is
gone
from
my
glass
would
recommend
for
all
dfh
fans
another
great
ale
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
wheat
yeast
malt
fruit
and
spice
the
appearance
is
orange
and
gold
with
a
smaller
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
rich
sweet
and
buttery
finish
the
plate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
the
aroma
does
not
smell
as
good
as
it
tastes
d
for
me
its
a
one
bottle
session
cant
really
see
myself
drinking
one
after
another
still
a
good
brew
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
its
a
little
boring
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
or
straight
out
of
the
bottle
from
notes
a
slightly
hazy
saffron
golden
orange
decent
sized
white
creamy
head
s
a
lot
of
grape
and
honey
also
a
good
deal
of
spice
and
floral
smell
t
lots
of
honey
and
semiacidic
grapes
decent
amount
of
malt
present
a
variety
of
spices
dance
around
along
with
some
floral
and
herbal
taste
sweet
winelike
taste
with
the
spices
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
kick
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
not
overly
so
m
medium
starting
to
go
toward
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
sticky
feeling
and
flavors
d
not
a
bad
beer
d
very
good
drinkability
for
a
9
abv
d
interesting
flavours
refreshing
without
cringing
from
the
9
abv
a
risk
that
pays
off
well
d
low
this
beer
is
not
the
style
that
i
like
i
had
big
hopes
though
but
it
is
just
not
for
me
i
had
had
enough
after
about
half
a
bottle
literally
drank
the
2nd
half
the
next
day
d
between
the
florals
in
the
smell
and
the
dry
grapes
in
the
taste
its
not
one
i
could
drink
one
after
another
that
said
its
still
a
great
brew
and
id
enjoy
having
it
each
time
a
batch
is
made
taken
for
whats
its
made
of
and
the
fascinating
story
behind
it
its
quite
a
treat
while
its
surprisingly
crisp
and
dry
the
mellow
honey
roll
and
kiss
of
malt
gives
it
a
touch
of
weight
leave
enough
space
of
time
in
between
having
a
glass
of
this
in
other
words
if
you
enjoy
it
as
i
do
i
wouldnt
suggest
drinking
this
more
than
once
every
34
months
its
a
tasty
respite
from
the
norm
but
you
cantshouldnt
knock
back
too
many
i
let
this
pour
warm
up
a
little
but
i
like
this
one
better
cold
drinks
like
a
white
wine
but
not
one
to
repeat
often
in
a
session
for
me
due
to
the
sweetness
something
you
should
try
at
least
once
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
drinker
when
you
dont
want
a
normal
beer
nice
for
a
after
dinner
beer
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
on
this
but
doesnt
really
show
until
the
beer
warms
up
a
nice
above
average
beer
from
dogfish
head
dogfish
head
is
known
for
specializing
in
fine
brews
of
nearincomparable
uniqueness
and
midas
touch
to
my
mind
is
one
such
beer
especially
considering
its
historical
background
the
sweet
and
inviting
aroma
opens
up
to
a
most
pleasant
flavor
profile
characterized
by
a
tasty
honey
sweetness
akin
to
a
traditional
mead
accentuated
by
the
sweet
and
tangy
grapes
well
balanced
by
the
barley
which
is
followed
by
a
most
delightful
aftertaste
that
lingers
nicely
from
start
to
finish
i
would
say
this
beer
is
superb
in
many
respects
and
therefore
highly
recommend
it
to
those
who
seek
something
truly
unique
in
a
beer
i
will
gladly
buy
it
again
d
very
drinkalble
beer
if
you
enjoy
the
sweet
stuff
higher
abv
could
sneek
up
on
you
if
you
kept
going
personally
would
prefer
this
more
as
a
meal
finisher
dessert
beer
another
great
beer
from
dfh
this
beer
is
too
sweet
to
be
considered
drinkable
i
will
give
dfh
credit
they
certainly
created
an
offcentered
beer
but
this
offcentered
fella
didnt
get
it
d
it
drinks
smooth
it
goes
down
easy
with
no
taste
of
alcohol
as
stated
above
im
glad
i
took
the
plunge
and
bought
this
ancient
ale
for
nothing
else
it
was
cool
to
drink
an
ale
that
the
recipe
came
from
a
2700
year
old
tomb
cant
beat
that
on
the
cool
scale
i
bought
this
beer
at
uptown
liquor
in
whittier
and
i
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
had
one
of
the
most
complex
tastes
ive
ever
had
every
time
i
took
a
drink
i
noticed
something
new
about
the
flavor
the
slight
crispness
and
the
kick
from
the
grape
after
taste
gives
it
a
wine
feel
to
it
that
is
unexplainable
i
drank
three
at
one
sitting
only
because
i
was
intrigued
by
the
beer
itself
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
get
enough
the
name
itself
really
describes
the
beer
the
first
drink
is
rough
but
if
u
give
it
a
few
seconds
u
will
really
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
i
think
the
only
down
side
is
the
label
not
very
attractive
almost
looks
like
a
mini
bottle
of
wine
dwell
considering
i
buy
this
beer
a
lot
and
have
never
regretted
it
id
say
the
drinkability
is
decent
ive
never
had
more
than
one
in
a
one
sitting
but
i
wouldnt
mind
doing
so
doesnt
drink
too
much
like
other
9
beers
but
its
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
say
a
90
minute
the
taste
continues
to
be
unique
and
satisfying
through
out
the
experience
picked
up
a
loose
bottle
at
the
local
beer
store
the
beer
pours
a
bright
goldenyellow
color
with
a
slight
head
that
quickly
disperses
the
beer
has
an
almost
saison
aroma
to
it
there
are
notes
of
fruit
roast
and
green
spices
which
i
had
a
hard
time
placing
basil
and
something
the
beer
is
sharp
and
crisp
as
it
passes
your
lips
and
quickly
followed
by
a
roasted
barley
and
peppery
flavor
the
spicy
notes
continue
through
into
the
aftertaste
combined
with
a
very
slightly
sour
malt
character
lingering
finish
which
allows
some
time
to
take
in
all
the
different
flavors
before
the
next
sip
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
and
rather
tasty
but
not
one
i
would
tackle
en
mass
wellbodied
never
feeling
too
thick
or
thin
and
the
nice
dry
semisweet
finish
keeps
it
drinkable
d
well
you
arent
going
to
throw
back
a
ton
of
these
its
definitely
a
sipper
still
i
really
like
this
beer
and
applaud
dfh
for
taking
a
chance
on
this
amazing
brew
d
this
is
a
beer
i
drink
a
lot
to
me
it
is
just
like
a
cheaper
readily
available
toned
down
version
of
chateau
jiahu
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
almost
gold
very
little
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
grapes
herbs
and
hone
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
aroma
flavor
is
dominated
by
grape
sweetness
and
floral
honey
big
flavor
impact
from
whatever
herbs
are
used
no
forthright
grain
or
hop
flavor
and
aroma
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
first
third
of
the
glass
but
things
turned
south
quickly
and
it
ended
up
being
a
drainpour
the
bitter
herb
flavor
became
too
dominant
as
the
beer
warmed
and
the
grape
flavors
were
also
unpleasant
and
warmer
temperatures
very
interesting
but
i
would
never
choose
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
or
anything
like
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
for
a
9
this
drinks
very
easy
definitely
not
bad
but
a
bit
overpriced
i
think
still
try
it
if
you
can
it
is
a
refreshing
departure
from
most
beer
and
a
great
offering
of
an
offcentered
ale
d
not
really
something
i
could
take
more
than
one
of
because
of
the
vinous
quality
cool
idea
for
a
beer
and
should
be
experienced
this
gets
considerably
better
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
and
perhaps
that
holds
truer
to
the
original
essence
of
the
brew
being
made
without
nifty
refrigerators
or
electricity
for
that
matter
its
cool
that
they
resurrected
something
ancient
that
tastes
like
a
lightly
carbonated
white
wine
but
im
not
sure
why
theyve
chosen
to
brew
this
yearround
going
by
memory
again
but
i
cant
forget
this
beer
since
ive
never
really
had
a
beer
that
tasted
as
close
to
wine
as
possible
as
this
does
i
dont
like
wine
so
id
take
this
beer
over
wine
any
day
which
tells
you
that
it
still
is
beer
the
first
thing
i
smelled
was
those
white
wine
grapes
and
the
malt
they
used
to
match
the
honey
the
malt
and
the
honey
mixes
in
well
together
the
honey
being
subtle
couldnt
detect
any
hops
at
all
which
also
contributes
to
the
wine
like
character
of
this
beer
light
carbonation
adds
to
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
body
i
really
couldnt
detect
the
9
percent
either
which
means
they
really
used
quality
ingredients
which
makes
it
such
a
top
notch
beer
when
it
comes
to
quality
when
i
smell
wine
the
alcohol
always
comes
out
the
most
but
this
since
its
so
well
crafted
and
almost
as
much
in
alcohol
as
wine
it
smells
of
everything
they
put
into
it
because
of
this
it
makes
me
come
out
liking
this
beer
even
though
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
in
one
night
this
is
good
if
you
want
a
diversion
during
a
session
after
several
bad
beers
i
have
lost
almost
all
hope
in
dfh
for
anything
besides
iipas
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
definitely
opens
your
eyes
to
the
evolution
of
beer
from
the
nearly
2700
year
old
recipe
to
the
beer
we
normally
consume
today
d
alcohol
was
quite
noticeable
not
surprised
that
its
9
abv
and
the
overwhelming
grape
taste
hamper
this
ones
drinkability
a
bit
drinkability
i
wouldve
given
this
a
perfect
5
0
but
thats
only
when
it
is
served
at
cellar
temperatures
if
served
in
the
high
30s
to
40s
like
most
beers
a
lot
of
the
taste
is
closed
off
and
the
beer
becomes
underwhelming
clear
golden
body
with
a
light
head
that
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
the
nose
was
full
of
fruit
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
lime
the
body
of
this
beer
is
very
present
yet
its
a
drinkable
beer
at
9
0
abv
malty
bread
presence
finished
with
a
grainy
bitterness
the
lingering
tasted
like
fried
bananas
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
this
beer
is
its
a
good
conversation
piece
ive
introduced
it
to
friends
that
are
noncraft
beer
drinkers
and
share
the
story
behind
it
and
the
reactions
have
always
been
this
is
a
good
beer
while
its
not
an
exceptional
beer
it
sort
of
embodies
the
craft
beer
culture
a
worthy
experiment
as
many
of
dogfishs
brews
are
i
agree
with
the
bros
that
this
would
go
well
with
spicygarlickymeaty
dishes
not
sure
if
this
goes
with
nachos
and
the
game
but
its
worth
a
shot
regardless
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
a
good
one
to
get
every
once
in
a
while
in
a
mix
sixer
enjoy
oily
slim
but
sharp
bubbles
full
bodied
robust
o
this
one
stands
alone
as
a
unique
beverage
im
all
for
experiments
along
the
lines
of
this
one
dont
expect
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
but
glad
to
have
met
it
along
my
tasting
journey
this
is
a
great
one
clear
beautiful
golden
ale
with
a
good
sized
white
head
and
nice
bits
of
lace
here
and
there
some
light
carbonation
evident
smell
is
light
sweet
malt
fresh
bread
and
a
bit
of
pepper
yeasty
fruitiness
folds
into
faint
pears
and
apples
and
in
the
back
some
grapes
taste
is
like
the
nose
but
bigger
and
broader
subtly
complex
malt
core
is
big
and
bursting
with
golden
ale
flavor
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
vinous
tartness
and
yeasty
bread
center
saffron
adds
depth
to
the
bread
and
is
the
perfect
accent
to
the
artful
malt
blend
light
fruits
flow
in
and
give
a
platform
for
the
muscat
grapes
to
meld
with
the
hops
in
the
finish
hops
are
earthy
and
mild
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
feel
is
crisp
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
the
weight
is
perfect
as
it
flows
like
a
session
ale
but
caresses
the
tongue
like
velvet
something
this
strong
should
not
go
down
this
easily
super
drinkable
and
about
to
become
a
staple
in
my
house
nice
brew
sam
very
expensive
brew
not
what
i
would
look
for
next
time
kudos
to
dfh
for
skating
on
the
edge
and
looking
good
while
doing
it
poured
medium
gold
from
a
12
oz
bottle
decent
white
head
that
faded
quickly
aroma
of
mead
and
young
white
wine
not
much
malt
or
any
hops
flavor
true
to
aroma
with
a
medium
to
light
body
with
a
honey
grape
juice
sweetness
kept
in
check
by
a
light
tannic
and
possibly
hop
bitterness
that
kept
the
palate
clean
a
light
boozy
note
for
an
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
leaning
more
toward
the
wine
end
of
the
spectrum
than
beer
worthy
of
a
sampling
or
as
a
gift
for
the
gastronomically
adventurous
drink
the
first
couple
sips
were
the
best
im
glad
i
could
chalk
this
one
up
ill
have
to
try
the
other
ancient
brew
series
drinkability
is
top
notch
while
it
is
a
sweet
tasting
beer
i
personally
would
drink
it
in
cycles
this
is
a
great
beer
anytime
of
the
year
but
its
definitely
best
around
the
holidays
my
extreme
appreciation
goes
to
the
makers
at
dogfish
head
for
making
such
good
products
keep
it
going
the
aftertaste
lingers
around
for
a
while
great
beer
overall
not
something
you
would
drink
every
day
but
definitely
a
beer
i
will
revisit
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
havent
just
to
say
youve
had
it
it
is
an
interesting
brew
especially
since
its
considered
to
be
one
of
the
oldest
recipes
still
in
existence
i
recommend
trying
it
seasoned
pro
or
amateur
d
a
truly
unique
brew
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
though
i
cant
entirely
recommend
it
its
also
just
a
bit
too
strange
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
d
grape
as
teh
main
flavor
of
a
beer
is
not
my
favorite
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
but
not
one
to
have
all
the
time
very
complex
it
is
not
very
drinkable
because
due
to
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
if
you
do
not
take
this
with
food
you
may
be
choking
down
the
last
gulp
lastly
do
not
let
this
beer
get
warm
it
turns
into
a
beast
okay
atmosphere
appearance
is
pretty
nondescript
nose
is
a
bizarre
balance
of
grain
and
mostly
sweet
and
tart
components
flavor
has
only
a
touch
of
grain
pull
through
but
the
other
components
rule
the
day
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
drinkability
not
to
interested
in
trying
this
one
again
its
ok
i
do
like
the
idea
this
is
a
different
brew
not
in
a
bad
way
easily
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
i
actually
could
session
this
caseworthy
although
the
abv
and
initial
taste
let
it
warm
may
leave
more
for
me
if
im
sharing
giggity
giggity
smells
of
light
honey
sweetness
floral
notes
and
a
general
light
fruitiness
tastes
a
good
deal
sweeter
than
it
smells
but
a
touch
of
crispness
some
husky
grain
and
a
quick
flare
of
grassyherbal
bitterness
at
the
swallow
keep
the
sweetness
somewhat
in
check
fruitiness
of
the
tangy
variety
tart
apple
peel
white
grapes
an
elusive
sweet
spiciness
smoothish
body
with
tight
prickly
carbonation
rather
warming
finish
yet
it
doesnt
taste
big
beforehand
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
beer
should
be
drank
like
wine
but
it
definitely
can
go
down
smooth
and
often
every
dogfish
head
fan
should
give
this
beer
a
try
reminded
me
of
a
spiced
up
hef
in
some
regards
d
easy
drinker
with
great
flavor
ok
ive
never
been
good
at
describing
wine
or
beer
but
here
i
go
its
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
anything
else
nice
saffron
finish
but
if
you
dont
like
saffron
dont
even
bother
it
would
pair
well
with
fish
not
oily
ceviche
blue
cheese
tart
fruit
keylime
pie
and
or
cioppino
i
liked
it
but
would
not
drink
it
alone
d
this
should
be
summer
sipper
can
go
down
very
easily
enjoyed
this
totally
different
beer
every
dogfish
fan
should
give
it
a
go
and
an
adventurous
newbie
who
likes
hefeweizzens
not
my
favorite
pours
an
ultra
clear
golden
honey
color
a
thin
offwhite
microbubbled
ring
occurs
smell
is
very
much
on
the
white
grape
side
with
a
slight
floral
quality
tastes
better
than
the
nose
imo
the
pronounced
grape
is
tart
and
effervescent
like
a
champagne
but
the
honey
smooths
it
out
in
the
end
maybe
it
feels
a
bit
oily
but
this
is
not
a
typical
brew
and
is
suitable
for
what
it
is
the
end
is
bitter
and
reminds
me
still
of
the
bubbly
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
very
sweet
with
grapes
honey
alcohol
perfumey
taste
is
pretty
complex
spice
esters
honey
saffron
grape
skin
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
low
to
medium
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
brew
that
pushes
the
limits
and
i
appreciate
it
i
will
try
this
again
and
finish
the
4
pack
but
probably
wont
buy
it
again
deven
though
this
is
a
9
00
i
dont
really
feel
it
but
the
overly
sweet
taste
is
a
put
off
for
me
d
despite
the
intense
sweetness
it
didnt
become
cloying
or
overbearing
which
is
sort
of
rare
for
a
dogfish
head
beer
the
beer
pours
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
white
thin
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
at
9
abv
it
gives
off
a
slight
alcoholic
smell
mixed
with
fruity
and
sweet
scents
the
taste
is
light
with
grape
honey
and
subtle
hoppy
notes
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
not
overpowering
and
leaves
a
clean
flavor
on
the
tongue
d
a
fun
unique
and
interesting
beer
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
pushing
the
limits
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
few
ounces
of
this
midas
touch
is
an
intriguing
brew
and
worth
a
try
d
almost
a
borderline
sessionable
brew
if
a
little
less
sweeter
all
in
all
a
very
flavorful
imaginative
creation
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
having
again
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
biscuit
malt
flowers
honey
grapes
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
mainly
grapes
and
flowers
with
some
honey
biscuit
malt
and
alcohol
mixed
in
as
the
beer
warms
i
start
to
get
a
little
more
caramel
malt
and
spices
although
the
spices
are
hard
to
identify
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
slightly
brownish
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
really
vinous
with
some
candy
sweetness
honey
slight
spice
and
citrus
notes
lurking
in
the
background
the
honey
and
grape
character
was
also
more
potent
palate
with
sweet
citrusy
notes
but
had
a
candy
sugar
punch
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
citrusy
vinous
sticky
finish
it
drank
very
good
and
was
surprisingly
better
than
i
thought
it
was
from
the
firt
time
i
tasted
it
salud
d
drinkable
not
an
everyday
beer
something

midas
touch
is
a
cool
idea
for
a

its
got
some
interesting

and
some
good
qualities
im
glad
i
tried
it

its
not

like
drinking
a
wine
rather
than
beer
but
its
even
easier
to
drink
thank
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
full
side
there
is
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
this
is
a
beer
that
you
have
to
sip
not
something
that
goes
down
extremely
easily
but
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
a
nice
easydrinking
beer
from
dfh
excellent
beer
served
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
and
good
lacing
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
malt
sweet
vineous
flavor
is
like
nose
but
far
more
rich
really
pick
up
on
the
honey
and
grapes
saffron
not
so
much
perhaps
a
little
in
the
bitterness
body
is
full
and
lush
with
perfect
finish
is
like
flavor
and
actually
fairly
long
with
the
alcohol
mellow
an
ale
made
with
saffron
who
would
do
this
only
dogfish
head
drinkability
a
very
unique
brew
to
say
the
least
i
like
the
concept
and
the
experimentation
but
im
not
sure
this
would
be
in
my
regular
drink
rotation
wow
this
seems
more
like
a
desert
beer
very
sweet
complex
and
unique
to
say
the
least
i
cant
really
even
describe
it
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
sweet
beers
ive
had
if
you
consider
it
beer
at
all
very
pricy
at
about
four
dollars
a
12oz
bottle
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
after
a
heavy
meal
to
finish
the
night
at
9
abv
three
or
four
and
youll
finish
the
night
right
with
a
great
desert
finisher
would
go
great
with
multiple
deserts
like
heavy
chocolate
cheese
cake
etc
only
a
4
on
drinkability
because
i
think
more
than
34
would
overwhelm
most
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
classic
true
above
average
cutting
edge
brew
that
challenges
the
norms
of
beer
making
a
must
try
at
least
once
o
really
disappointed
with
this
one
dr
one
is
good
but
ill
save
the
others
for
another
night
so
i
guess
my
inability
to
come
up
with
250
words
is
some
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
beer
d
regardless
of
how
much
i
hated
it
and
how
even
by
the
end
the
taste
never
evened
out
i
applaud
dogfish
head
for
creating
a
beer
little
have
tackled
it
wasnt
so
bad
that
it
would
have
been
a
drain
poor
but
for
the
price
i
could
have
gotten
something
heavier
better
tasting
and
with
more
covered
up
alcohol
only
drink
this
if
you
love
wine
taken
during
hurricane
alex
served
in
a
bayernpilsener
glass
look
amber
right
color
thin
and
creamy
foam
head
good

head
lasts

smell
green
grapes
and
honey
taste
cascade
of
spices
and
spicy
hops
some
alcohol
too
mouthfeel
fruity
and
spicy
viscous
body
evident
the
abv
drinkability
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
grapes
and
alcohol
i
liked
watching
the
rain
d
this
was
a
cool
beer
to
try
obviously
i
havent
had
anything
similar
to
this
before
but
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
almost
like
a
white
wine
triple
combination
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
loses
some
points
very
enjoyable
in
small
quantities
but
the
honey
sweetness
is
a
little
much
and
means
that
one
bottle
of
this
can
be
a
little
bit
difficult
to
finish
if
one
split
a
bottle
between
two
or
three
this
would
work
well
as
a
dessert
drink
or
possibly
as
an
apperitif
o
a
combination
of
high
abv
and
strong
flavor
makes
this
a
one
and
move
on
type
of
beer
itd
be
best
as
a
night
cap
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
muscat
grapes
saffron
white
wine
malts
godly
tastes
sweet
from
muscat
grapes
saffron
some
citrus
hops
are
there
but
they
only
lighten
the
sweetness
just
a
tad
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
and
drinkability
is
insane
one
could
drink
half
a
gallon
not
good
for
your
liver
that
it
tastes
so
awesome
overall
a
great
brew
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
dfh
probably
my
third
favorite
of
theirs
behind
60
min
ipa
and
their
iba
respectively
this
beer
poured
a
very
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
not
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
was
also
surprisingly
transparent
which
i
thought
made
it
look
really
appealing
you
could
smell
the
yeast
and
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
first
sip
took
me
very
much
by
surprise
it
is
malty
and
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
what
i
have
been
drinking
lately
you
can
really
taste
the
honey
in
this
beer
and
it
gives
it
a
very
nice
sweet
finish
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
just
a
wee
bit
in
there
too
i
was
actually
surprised
when
i
looked
and
saw
that
this
beer
was
9
because
it
is
definetly
hidden
well
in
this
which
is
also
surprising
since
it
is
such
a
nice
easy
going
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
great
on
this
it
coated
the
mouth
nicely
had
a
nice
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
just
awesome
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
will
for
sure
be
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
not
too
distant
future
overall
this
has
a
high
drinkability
pick
up
a
4
pack
and
dip
in
every
6
months
thats
my
plan
anyways
too
close
to
a
fruity
white
wine
for
me
i
appreciate
the
beer
for
what
it
is
but
not
for
me
will
explore
again
im
sure
meh
the
first
sip
was
great
no
joke
but
it
just
degrades
with
every
warmer
sip
as
each
change
in
degree
brings
out
the
alcohol
more
and
more
they
must
have
used
a
crap
load
of
honey
to
clear
this
one
up
so
much
were
any
specialty
grains
used
at
all
am
i
tasting
saffron
is
it
really
worth
trying
to
taste
for
d
more
of
a
unique
beer
and
not
one
i
would
consider
buying
in
bulk
it
has
some
qualities
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
i
love
seeing
breweries
mix
things
up
but
this
brew
just
seemed
a
little
far
off
and
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
on
the
other
hand
for
a
herbalspiced
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
if
thats
your
thing
i
think
youll
like
this
one
a
good
effort
but
not
completely
my
cup
of
tea
d
it
has
its
time
and
place
for
me
id
love
to
work
on
pairing
this
with
food
maybe
thai
i
think
id
prefer
it
as
a
nice
departure
from
my
normal
beers
without
getting
something
ridiculously
strange
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
regard
to
flavor
profiles
and
overall
drinkability
i
feel
that
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
a
few
of
these
as
i
would
get
rather
bored
with
the
strange
taste
that
is
a
relic
of
the
past
i
love
what
dfh
has
done
with
these
ancient
beers
and
do
like
this
one
but
a
very
nice
beer
to
try
not
to
session
overall
drinkability
was
rather
nice
could
have
done
with
more
hoppiness
overall
i
am
mildly
ambiguous
on
midas
touch
on
the
one
hand
its
decent
on
the
other
hand
theres
enough
of
a
balance
here
as
well
as
the
sentimental
value
of
it
being
an
ancient
recipe
to
make
it
something
i
occasionally
indulge
in
and
recommend
greatly
to
beer
newbies
d
if
i
put
away
several
of
these

the

a

aroma
woo
dis
is
a
sweet
beer
the
front
end
features
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
is
really
crisp
that
fades
to
a
sticky
sweetness
with
some
astringent
and
medicinal
notes
and
then
fades
out
with
a

i

to

of

break
it
down
one
was

honeylike
flavor
with
a
little

of

there
is
a
spice
in
there
too
but
i
cant
put
my

on
it
there
is
a
dry
peppery
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
kind
of
nice
the
high
alcohol
in
this
mellows
out
as
you
drink
it
is
drinkable
in
small
doses

is
a

are
going

i
cant

myself
wanting
more
than
one
of
these
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
with
a
minimum
of
fizzy
white
head
and
the
significantly
elevated
alcohol
appears
only
as
a
nice
warming
it
finishes
dry
bunnyhustle
d
its
different
and
worth
a
try
saw
something
on
the
history
channel
on
beer
about
this
two
years
ago
or
so
and
havent
been
able
to
forget
about
it
finally
picked
one
up
real
unique
beer
looks
seems
like
a
lager
or
pilsner
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
does
stick
around
but
doesnt
really
do
much
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nice
honey
and
fruit
ester
tones
same
with
smell
let
this
beer
warm
up
i
had
one
cold
and
it
literally
had
nothing
going
on
i
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
on
the
second
warm
up
and
the
results
were
much
much
better
tastes
is
very
unique
lots
of
fruit
again
grapes
or
raisins
lots
of
light
flavors
similar
to
a
lager
sweets
like
honeys
as
well
unique
different
fun
beer
definitely
not
one
id
expect
to
see
on
tap
or
on
menus
not
really
one
to
have
too
much
of
d
with
no
overpowering
notes
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
dont
let
the
alcohol
creep
up
on
you
this
one
packs
a
9
wallop
but
its
not
readily
evident
driakabilty
was
great
i
found
it
smooth
and
tasty
but
i
do
perfer
slighty
bigger
beers
with
this
level
abv
i
did
expect
it
to
be
a
bit
stronger
but
im
not
complaining
d
this
beer
is
what
you
make
of
it
if
you
expect
the
standard
offering
from
most
craft
beers
then
midas
touch
may
disappoint
if
on
the
other
hand
you
enjoy
both
wine
and
beer
and
expect
a
weird
hybrid
of
the
two
you
will
probably
enjoy
what
dogfish
head
has
done
here
this
could
easily
stand
in
for
moscato
dasti
where
a
somewhat
heavier
offering
is
desired
d
not
very
drinkable
very
boozy
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
beer
as
it
was
certainly
worth
a
try
it
would
make
a
grea
brew
for
a
warm
spring
day
d
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
too
many
nice
to
sip
and
a
refreshing
change
from
my
usual
dipas
not
something
i
would
expend
the
finances
for
considering
the
14

pack
pricing
well
made
nonetheless
which
is
the
norm
coming
from
dfh
d
3

very
sipable
with
spicy
food
or
to
share
a
wine
like
brew
but
not
a
session
beer
for
sure
an
interesting
attempt
for
a
unique
brew
from
dfh
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
aroma
of
dry
white
winegrapesand
spice
must
be
the
saffron
and
pale
malts
flavor
is
sweet
up

to

and
flavorfulwith

honey
notes
medium
to

sticky
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
dry
spicy
finish
a
very
interesting
brewit
took
me
a
few
sips
to
get
into
itand
by
the
end
i
thought
it
to
be
pretty
good
d
goes
down
at
first
fairly
well
but
is
a
little
sweet
for
a
lot
of
consumption
bottle
pour
was
a
medium
gold
head
is
almost
nonexsistent
aroma
was
flowery
and
sweet
taste
was
right
away
sweet
and
flowery
just
like
the
aroma
promised
but
not
overly
annoying
my
wife
enjoyed
this
also
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
sitting
but
good
regardless
d
this
is
very
drinkable
although
it
is
a
bit
pricey
i
imagine
that
is
because
of
the
saffron
worth
the
little
extra
though
d
the
unique
make
up
of
this
brew
is
intriguing
and
provokes
continual
sipping
to
answer
the
question
what
is
that
taste
d
this
really
is
unique
very
sweet
and
yet
quite
spicy
started
the
pour
soft
but
due
to
lack
of
head
forming
i
stepped
it
up
a
coupe
notches
got
a
nice
2finger
white
head
but
it
left
as
soon
as
it
came
no

i

is

reviewpoet

know
itbecause
it
doesnt
fall
into
normal
beer
style
ranges
the
honey
taste
seems
subdued

to

the
grapes
seem
to
come

the

i
could
have
perhaps
three
of
these
before

grow

i
only
bought
1
however
i
must
say
its
really
cool
of

to
give
us
this

it

like
a

beer
kind
of
resembles
a
syrupy
white
wine
nice
to
try
but
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
interesting
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
the
try
dogfish
head
does
it
again
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
id
hit
that
again
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
many
people
that
find
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
too
much
for
high
drinkability
out
of
the
bottle
find
no
such
problem
with
it
on
tap
as
it
becomes
quite
a
bit
more
mellowed
thought
i
find
it
to
be
almost
as
satisfying
bottled
an
exceptional
brew
not
to
be
missed
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
twofinger
beige
head
the
smell
has
some
grapes
and
honey
almost
meadlike
the
taste
is
almost
winelike
with
some
sweet
grape
taste
and
honey
that
gives
way
to
some
spiciness
with
a
dry
finish
and
some
alcohol
warming
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
some
fine
carbonation
a
very
interesting
beer
ill
definitely
be
recommending
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
unique
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
especially
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
compared
to
most
beers
this
is
very
different
the
grapes
give
a
dry
aftertastemouthfeel
similar
to
a
wine
the
lack
of
hops
gives
this
beer
a
very
sweet
taste
the
aroma
also
has
that
distint
stingy
smell
that
a
dry
wine
has
you
can
taste
the
honey
the
color
is
an
amberish
red
with
almost
no
head
very
different
beer
but
i
for
and
i
bought
into
the
hype
that
it
was
revived
from
an
acient
recipe
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
interesting
but
in
a
good
way
d
not
something
that
i
would
drink
a
whole
lot
of
though
i
appreciate
the
efforts
to
reconstitute
history
drinkability
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
i
would
have
this
again
but
perhaps
only
one
in
a
sitting
to
me
it
has
a
chardonnay
taste
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
an
excellent
one
either
medium
gold
in
color
and
has
a
quickly
fading
head
smells
slightly
like
honey
but
the
white
grapes
come
out
in
the
taste
it
actually
has
the
aftertaste
of
a
hoppy
white
wine
which
is
starngely
nice
mouthfeel
is
good
with
medium
carbonation
the
hidden
alcohol
makes
this
quite
a
nice
beer
very
unique

that

some

slight

anything

very

drinkability
as
i
mentioned
above
in
the
taste
this
ones
plenty
interesting
and
unique
though
perhaps
a
little
too
strange
to
be
classified
as
highly
drinkable
also
it
is
starting
to
get
up
there
for
a
beer
though
not
for
dfh
so
at
least
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
in
to
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
though
drinkability
is
hard
to
report
on
this
beer
as
it
is
not
something
that
you
would
drink
a
bunch
of
in
a
sitting
but
i
have
had
no
problem
finishing
this
snifter
poured
into
a
12
ounch
snifter
color
is
light
amber
and
crystal
clear
has
a
scent
of
honey
you
can
taste
the
grapes
slightly
and
honey
and
leaves
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
finish
overall
a
good
offering
from
dogfish
head
but
the
price
was
a
bit
steep
for
a
4
pack
would
recommend
to
try
d
definitely
a
good
brew
worth
a
taste
for
its
pure
deliciousness
not
to
mention
its
historical
significance
i
would
get
it
again
but
not
an
everyday
beer
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
for
originality
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
it
again
just
to
drink
beer
drinkability
the
way
the
taste
fades
so
quickly
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
makes
it
difficult
for
this
to
be
a
sipper
its
not
really
a
session
beer
either
as
it
is
fairly
sweet
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
id
by
this
again
to
have
some
lying
around
but
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
to
drink
it
quite
a
tasty
beverage
from
the
dogfish
head
brewery
i
thought
this
would
be
too
sweet
considering
the
muscat
grapes
and
saffron
however
this
beer
had
almost
everything
needed
to
pull
off
the
right
amount
of
malty
bitterness
to
sweet
after
taste
the
golden
amber
smooth
coloration
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
the
sweet
but
subtle
smell
allowed
for
enjoyment
to
be
had
all
the
way
through
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
as
for
drinkability
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
certainly
cant
fault
dfh
for
experimenting
it
is
pretty
easy
going
down
in
spite
of
the
rich
flavor
m
d
medium
body
but
the
tartness
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
take
down
add
to
that
the
big
9
and
its
not
the
best
drinker
not
too
bad
but
not
really
my
thing
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
an
inch
high
white
head
quickly
recedes
but
leaves
little
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
bready
with
hints
of
white
grape
coming
through
the
lightest
underlying
sourness
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
plenty
of
floral
honey
flavors
more
of
the
grapes
coming
through
on
the
tongue
slightly
sour
and
acidic
bready
and
warming
alcohol
the
flavors
are
very
interesting
together
but
not
sure
if
im
picking
up
any
saffron
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
good
carb
bite
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
not
completely
hidden
but
its
not
overpowering
at
9
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
definitely
one
to
try
at
least
once
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
dogfish
head
the
pour
is
very
nice
its
golden
like
the
name
implies
its
got
a
deep
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
really
is
closer
to
a
wine
it
taste
and
smells
similar
to
what
a
fruit
based
wine
should
be
it
smells
of
rich
sweet
malts
a
few
hops
hints
and
lots
of
sweet
mild
spices
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
has
a
great
crisp
after
taste
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
every
mouth
but
i
would
definately
say
its
a
must
have
on
the
dogfish
line
up
mouthfeel
also
is
a
little
off
for
beer
ill
give
it
a
go
and
because
im
the
perservering
type
ill
try
to
be
openminded
and
make
it
through
the
bottle
but
this
is
not
my
glass
of
beer
cheers
d
this
is
a
nice
unique
beer
with
some
nice
fruity
notes
this
has
plenty
of
food
pairing
potential
its
decently
reminiscent
of
a
sauternes
dthe
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
could
go
for
another
bottle
immediately
that
said
i
cant
imagine
making
an
evening
out
of
this
beer
but
then
again
if
it
was
cheaper
im
very
pleased
with
this
herbedspiced
beer
d
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
too
syrupy
sweet
like
drinking
grape
corn
syrup
i
dont
really
have
anything
comparable
to
compare
this
brew
to
just
too
much
sugar
for
my
palate
first
taste
is
of
grapes
vino
taste
followed
by
some
great
spices
pretty
well
rounded
spices
are
a
litttle
to
strong
with
the
grapes
for
my
liking
overall
pretty
refreshing
the
9
is
masked
reallly
well
while
i
applaud
the
effort
i
will
probably
not
be
a
repeat
drinker
but
alas
i
will
continue
to
spend
my
money
on
their
beers
though
the
bay
area
seems
to
only
have
a
few
in
bulk
to
choose
from
namely
90
minute
ipa
midas
touch
and
palo
santo
marron
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
to
anyone
because
as
my
friends
have
diverse
tastes
and
palates
they
all
liked
it
not
the
greatest
flavor
profile
imaginable
but
it
wasnt
too
hard
to
put
down
easy
to
drink
beer
went
great
with
chicken
and
malanga
rice
super
interesting
concept
from
dfh
aroma
smells
dry
almost
vinous
taste
is
super
super
dry
also
vinous
lots
of
honey
in
there
also
overall
its
not
my
style
at
all
and
i
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
but
i
can
respect
it
for
what
it
is
drinkability
is
moderate
a
decent
overall
brew
strange
and
not
alltogether
amazing
mead
like
at
times
good
for
a
tasting
but
not
for
extended
drinking

this
one
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
bold
sweet
smell
the
saffron
and
honey
are
very
apparent
in
the
taste
with
the
white
muscat
grapes
giving
it
and
interesting
characteristic
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
one
but
i
was
very
impressed
the
only
reason
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
is
because
of
the
price
but
it
is
a
good
one
to
try
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
and
glad
i
tried
it
definitely
shows
the
wide
range
that
beer
can
bring
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
my
girlfriend
a
non
beer
drinker
though
loved
it
though
this
may
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
it
is
far
from
being
excessive
i
bought
this
totally
for
the
historicalnovelty
factor
it
is
based
off
of
a
recipe
derived
probably
with
a
fair
amount
of
liberty
from
beer
residue
in
an
ancient
tomb
imagine
a
dry
mead
meeting
an
asti
spumante
meeting
an
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
pours
not
surprisingly
clear
gold
forced
a
small
white
head
out
of
the
bottle
nearly
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
the
grapes
and
honey
dominate
the
aroma
taste
is
very
sweet
lots
of
honey
and
the
grapes
give
it
a
wine
overtone
some
spice
the
barley
is
nearly
undetectable
i
have
no
idea
why
they
said
an
ipa
drinker
would
like
this
its
barely
a
beer
interesting
beer
and
interesting
concept
i
have
been
rating
on
ratebeer
when
it
is
up
and
on
here
and
i
think
my
rating
here
might
be
completely
different
as
this
one
warms
it
becomes
more
like
beer
with
honey
flavors
whereas
initially
it
tasted
like
mildly
hopped
mead
pours
pale
orange
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
weakly
malty
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
flavor
is
the
funky
part
mead
winey
with
a
strong
layer
that
i
can
best
describe
as
a
less
sweet
tripel
somehow
this
one
all
seems
to
work
ok
but
i
doubt
i
would
beat
down
any
doors
to
get
this
one
regularly
kudos
to
dfh
for
pushing
the
envelope
but
this
isnt
a
direction
that
im
interested
in
d
another
dogfish
head
brew
that
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
though
overall
the
beer
surprised
me
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
that
good
the
taste
was
pretty
fruity
sweet
though
and
i
dont
think
i
could
take
this
in
huge
proportions
d
a
little
heavy
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
that
seems
to
be
intentional
overall
this
is
an
awful
beer
i
bought
one
bottle
because
i
saw
a
segment
about
it
on
the
history
chanel
and
was
interested
yes
it
was
interesting
because
of
the
story
behind
it
and
the
fact
that
it
was
different
but
as
a
beer
this
was
awful
im
so
sure
of
how
bad
this
beer
is
that
i
wont
even
revisit
it
again
too
many
good
beers
out
there
d
unique
imaginative
interesting
while
all
of
these
treats
are
commendable
they
dont
always
come
together
to
equal
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
it
had
a
decent
transient
head
light
copper
color
with
great
clarity
and
effervescence
smelled
primarily
of
grape
some
honey
and
sugar
clean
taste
surprisingly
simple
flavor
profile
begins
with
grape
and
honey
very
briefly
then
gives
way
to
sourdoughesque
barley
and
a
little
spice
saffron
perhaps
pretty
light
body
crisp
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
a
bit
astringent
and
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
my
second
time
first
time
was
about
2
years
ago
having
this
brew
and
i
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
as
it
stands
now
it
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
all
that
impressive
d
too
sweet
for
too
many
but
a
very
good
single
beer
the
taste
begins
with
a
blast
of
abv
and
then
the
other
flavors
emerge
this
is
definitely
a
vinous
compound
with
grape
skin
and
liqueur
like
qualities
there
are
some
raisiny
flavors
in
addition
to
the
grape
plenty
of
orange
rind
and
perhaps
a
fig
like
note
or
two
the
beer
is
strong
a
sipping
type
beer
with
a
high
abv
that
isnt
masked
over
and
one
gets
the
impression
it
was
intended
to
be
hidden
in
any
fashion
the
beer
is
very
smooth
a
bit
syrupy
enjoyable
but
not
great
medium
heft
in
body
with
a
semisyrup
like
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
and
reasonably
drinkable
for
the
big
9
abv
worth
tasting
for
the
style
if
you
can
handle
the
sweetness
d
interesting
grapes
are
quite
strong
but
dont
obliterate
the
rest
tastes
a
bit
like
a
blond
belgian
with
grapes
i
imagine
the
dfh
version
is
much
better
than
whatever
the
ancient
brewers
were
making
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
valdieu
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
almost
no
head
and
left
just
a
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
hints
of
barley
and
honey
but
with
nothing
else
from
the
label
coming
through
the
taste
is
funky
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
or
bad
way
barely
and
honey
come
through
with
an
odd
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
while
i
have
a
4
pack
i
think
i
might
want
to
try
to
unload
this
on
some
of
my
curious
friends
very
drinkable
were
it
not
for
the
abv
personally
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
i
would
feel
it
in
the
morning
definitely
considering
finding
this
for
new
years
eve
d
an
interesting
beer
with
really
neat
flavors
which
would
be
nice
to
have
with
dinner
or
to
have
one
to
try
not
obviously
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
diversion
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
well
i
was
glad
i
gave
this
brew
a
chance
but
i
have
to
say
it
greatly
underperformed
on
all
expectations
wife
hated
it
which
kind
of
ruined
the
purpose
and
i
was
certainly
no
fan
definetly
not
a
brew
ill
be
revisiting
or
recommending
im
glad
that
i
tried
this
product
of
ancient
brewing
techniques
will
it
ever
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
no
why
because
it
is
a
special
beer
best
saved
for
the
right
occasion
midas
vinous
qualities
recommend
it
for
pairing
with
fine
gourmet
it
is
just
as
sophisticated
as
any
good
wine
but
so
much
more
interesting
pours
gold
with
stark
white
head
ok
retention
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
weaker
than
expected
muscat
grapes
honey
and
spices
peek
through
taste
is
sweet
malt
honey
and
spiced
fruit
no
hop
presence
and
maybe
a
lack
of
complexity
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
full
and
nicely
conceals
the
alcohol
a
tasty
brew
that
i
will
revisit
d
hmm
its
interesting
and
worth
trying
but
i
cant
ever
see
trying
it
again
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
was
left
with
a
sweetened
grassy
and
underspiced
brew
its
hard
for
me
because
i
love
experimental
beers
and
im
in
general
a
fan
of
most
of
what
dfh
does
this
one
just
falls
short
and
i
cant
really
find
a
compelling
reason
to
drink
it
the
sweetsyrupy
is
similar
to
a
light
barleywine
while
the
barley
and
light
grape
notes
hearken
more
toward
a
spicy
lager
not
really
feeling
this
one
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
experience
but
thats
about
it
d
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
otherwise
i
would
not
go
for
it
again
decent
but
not
amazing
worth
a
try
just
to
experience
it
overall
not
nearly
as
extreme
as
i
had
expectedhoped
still
worth
a
try
though
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
i
like
the
fact
that
the
history
of
this
beer
is
so
awesome
and
whoever
thought
to
conjure
up
a
beer
recipe
from
a
tomb
is
the
man
the
beer
itself
is
hard
to
judge
just
because
its
so
different
ive
never
had
saffron
so
im
not
sure
what
it
even
smellstastes
like
which
made
it
hard
overall
though
it
smelled
decent
had
a
good
well
balanced
taste
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
for
being
9
abv
worth
a
try
for
sure
hard
to
say
how
this
beer
lines
up
is
it
beer
is
it
wine
is
it
mead
all
the
ingredients
make
classification
hard
either
way
i
find
it
very
good
hrmnnnm
ive
had
this
several
times
and
keep
hoping
it
gets
better
so
far
no
luck
worth
a
shot
for
the
weird
factor
but
the
jiahu
is
much
better
buy
a
single
and
see
for
yourself
a
bit
cloying
in
the
sweetness
department
not
to
say
that
it
is
bad
just
not
for
me
glad
to
try
though
the
taste
is
similar
in
overall
character
and
in
being
reminiscent
of
something
like
steel
reserve
but
more
refined
and
smooth
with
greater
complexity
it
is
rather
sweet
with
a
meaty
pungent
fruity
alcohol
quality
freshly
baked
bread
at
first
plus
grapes
and
raisins
hint
of
grass
and
spices
grape
skins
sweet
wine
and
raw
honey
hint
of
burnt
butter
or
burnt
caramel
alcohol
is
quite
evident
in
oily
spicey
feel
and
warmth
but
mostly
pleasantly
so
after
the
first
few
sips
the
fresh
bread
quality
dies
down
and
the
alcohol
starts
to
take
over
a
bit
threatening
to
become
too
rough
and
interfering
with
the
drink
a
bit
but
never
really
dragging
the
drink
down
the
fresh
bread
element
though
weakening
in
the
front
and
middle
remains
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
beer
different
but
very
good
taste
mouthfeel
light
sweetness
and
esters
up
front
honey
is
faintly
noticed
but
i
cant
taste
the
saffron
at
all
theres
a
touch
of
spiciness
but
coming
more
from
the
yeast
light
acidity
the
finish
is
reasonably
dry
and
only
slightly
bitter
this
isnt
nearly
as
cloying
as
it
sounds
but
its
not
as
interesting
either
not
a
bad
brew
drinkability
is
good
but
id
have
this
only
once
in
a
great
while
as
its
really
to
sweet
and
spiced
for
me
to
have
often
i
dont
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
two
in
a
night
maybe
though
still
a
decent
offering
from
dfh
not
something
i
see
being
a
hit
though
i
dont
think
it
was
meant
for
that
either
experimental
beers
are
usually
interesting
this
one
is
no
different
but
not
one
i
could
drink
very
often
because
of
its
sweetness
another
consistently
well
made
brew
by
these
guys
no
rough
edges
here
and
they
achieved
exactly
what
they
set
out
to
do
unfortunately
this
beer
goes
beyond
beer
snobbishness
something
i
admit
to
right
into
the
kingdom
of
the
beer
nerd
all
palates
are
different
as
is
a
level
of
openmindedness
but
this
is
more
about
conversation
and
image
than
taste
here
i
cant
imagine
someone
enjoying
his
period
overly
sweet
too
damn
much
grape
i
cannot
think
of
what
id
want
to
eat
with
this
maybe
middleeastern
fare
rice
and
currant
dishes
or
even
imagine
sitting
down
with
a
snifter
and
sipping
this
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
absolutely
be
adventurous
and
try
it
mooch
one
if
you
can
but
do
not
buy
this
the
first
drink
had
so
much
going
on
it
felt
like
silk
on
my
tongue
left
a
zing
crisp
taste
tasted
like
a
mix
between
a
pilsner
and
a
kolsch
it
had
a
wheat
taste
but
not
strong
you
could
tell
the
alcohol
was
there
but
it
tasted
smooth
not
overpowering
i
am
very
happy
i
tried
it
and
i
might
get
1
again
but
im
not
sure
about
a
4
pack
try
it
for
me
i
could
only
have
one
of
these
it
was
way
to
sweet
and
just
wasnt
my
kind
of
beer
definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
which
i
thought
id
never
say
for
any
kind
of
dogfish
head
beer
anyway
midas
touch
is
a
light
golden
beer
with
little
head
but
plenty
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
honey
spices
and
grape
the
taste
is
stronger
on
the
barley
with
a
lot
of
sweet
grape
following
it
theres
enough
spice
and
malt
to
balance
things
out
for
most
of
my
way
through
the
bottle
but
not
quite
enough
the
sweetness
lingers
a
bit
like
drinking
too
much
welchs
white
grape
juice
i
used
to
love
that
stuff
but
the
flavor
defines
the
term
cloying
while
welchs
is
an
overcomparison
on
my
part
the
grape
flavoring
needs
to
be
toned
down
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
gets
a
little
sticky
or
that
could
be
a
flashback
to
my
brown
bag
lunches
in
grade
school
drinkability
really
suffered
for
me
as
i
made
my
way
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
was
ready
to
be
done
with
the
lingering
sweetness
its
not
a
bad
beer
particularly
for
the
variety
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
but
i
wont
be
paying
35
cents
an
ounce
for
it
again
da
decent
interesting
brew
but
not
something
i
see
myself
ever
craving
dogfish
head
consistently
delivers
but
this
one
is
far
from
my
favorite
below
average
drinkability
on
this
one
full
flavored
but
a
little
too
busy
and
too
much
abv
to
be
sessionable
maybe
just
one
at
a
time
i
read
about
this
one
when
it
first
came
out
so
naturally
when
i
saw
it
on
a
local
shelf
i
had
to
get
it
bottled
62708
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
mini
snifter
beer
is
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
ring
of
carbonation
that
forms
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
small
amounts
of
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
wonderfull
boquett
of
grapes
a
touch
of
barley
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
honey
and
grapes
transitions
to
a
warming
alcohol
bite
and
finishes
with
a
malty
grainy
finish
what
a
transition
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
i
had
expected
the
carbonation
is
there
but
not
overly
aggressive
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
although
i
believe
one
could
easily
quaff
this
a
very
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
hats
off
to
dfh
very
different
brew
outside
the
box
brewing
while
it
is
respectable
for
what
it
is
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
24
karat
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
visible
carbonation
rising
subpar
retention
but
good
lacing
aromas
are
slightly
sweet
wet
barley
grapes
and
apples
the
flavors
were
impressive
because
they
are
well
blended
especially
because
they
totally
conceal
the
9
alc
honey
sweetness
first
hits
your
palate
followed
by
the
green
grape
and
assorted
spices
gets
a
little
hoppy
at
the
end
when
a
bit
of
bitterness
shows
up
the
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
creamy
at
first
but
a
little
frothy
as
it
goes
down
this
is
if
you
dare
a
sessionable
brew
which
amazes
me
given
its
knockout
punch
alcohol
percentage
easy
to
drink
clean
and
nuanced
without
being
inyourface
a
little
better
retention
is
the
only
thing
it
lacks
this
brewery
makes
some
great
beers
but
this
one
is
a
must
try
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
lasted
until
the
final
sip
sweet
grape
honey
and
a
light
lavender
aroma
grapes
are
the
main
flavor
starting
sweet
like
a
grappa
and
ending
aged
like
a
port
wine
there
is
a
sweet
honey
and
raisin
taste
medium
body
highly
carbonated
this
has
a
very
dry
finish
nice
experimental
brew
but
one
per
sitting
is
enough
if
there
is
one
aspect
of
this
that
stands
out
its
the
absolute
drinkability
the
sweet
grape
smooth
texture
nice
malt
all
combine
to
make
this
one
thats
easy
to
down
its
not
the
best
most
complex
beer
but
its
certainly
good
worth
trying
and
a
good
effort
from
dogfish
head
making
this
review
all
the
more
exciting
if
i
could
remember
where
i
saw
it
i
will
update
the
review
with
a
link
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
much
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
it
is
a
very
interesting
concept
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
too
many
of
these
bottles
an
complex
and
interesting
ale
i
can
honestly
say
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
before
i
have
had
a
few
examples
of
ales
claiming
to
be
made
with
ancient
recipes
those
were
either
too
cloying
or
too
mundane
this
one
has
the
right
balance
for
that
reason
im
going
to
rate
it
higher
than
typical
reviews
you
have
to
be
able
to
pick
out
the
flavor
in
order
to
truly
enjoy
this
ale
as
i
said
it
might
be
even
better
with
some
aging
and
might
take
on
more
of
a
portlike
quality
im
no
expert
there
but
this
is
worth
a
shot
at
least
once
try
it
it
wont
hurt
you
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
not
really
what
i
would
call
drinkable
but
its
pretty
tasty
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
quickly
disappearing
head
honey
is
there
in
the
aromabut
i
also
get
a
slight
soda
sweetness
as
well
taste
reminds
me
of
mead
but
also
i
get
a
7up
taste
from
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
mouthfeel
is
light
and
at
the
same
time
smooth
drinkability
isnt
very
high
for
me
i
cant
see
drinking
more
of
this
soon
i
like
this
beer
from
dfh
but
i
think
i
will
pass
on
having
another
one
of
these
for
a
while
dark
golden
colored
topped
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
a
bit
this
is
sweet
and
tangy
with
lots
of
grapes
and
honey
and
a
bit
winelike
some
alcohol
shows
and
the
whole
thing
seems
a
tad
too
sweet
aftertaste
is
sour
pretty
good
sipper
and
not
surprising
with
dogfish
head
its
a
bit
different
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
interesting
im
picking
up
some
sugary
candy
smells
as
well
as
some
dried
fruits
like
cherry
grape
and
plum
little
bit
of
spicyphenolic
in
the
background
taste
isnt
what
youd
think
from
the
smell
tastes
like
a
port
mixed
with
a
beer
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
then
flavored
with
cooking
spices
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
she
warms
finishes
kinda
sweet
with
a
lingering
spice
that
holds
the
taste
buds
hostage
thick
body
sticky
mouthfeel
ample
carbonation
different
to
say
the
least
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
one
very
often
but
im
glad
sam
brewed
this
for
me
to
try
a
bit
sticky
and
absolutely
chewy
a
lot
of
unfermentable
but
all
in
all
a
great
addition
to
the
wall
drinkability
it
was
great
sipping
beer
and
i
would
dink
it
again
not
my
first
choice
of
a
beer
but
definately
different
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
too
sweet
and
too
expensive
damn
you
king
midas
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
abv
however
its
not
a
great
drink
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
has
a
slightly
rough
bite
and
aftertaste
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
then
one
d
i
couldnt
get
past
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
and
on
the
way
down
it
burned
if
it
was
warm
it
would
be
good
a
definite
sipper
but
good
nonetheless
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
the
honey
in
here
gives
it
some
body
carbonation
is
spot
on
great
beer
one
that
everyone
should
try
this
is
one
for
wine
drinkers
it
would
be
a
nice
crossover
for
them
in
my
opinion
and
if
you
love
mead
than
this
one
is
also
for
you
this
is
one
ill
definitely
be
buying
again
easy
to
drink
however
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
just
a
nice
beer
to
sit
and
relax
with
d
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
pale
i
certainly
note
the
flavors
mentioned
on
the
bottle
but
the
end
result
is
nothing
that
out
of
the
ordinary
everything
about
this
beer
is
well
balanced
though
and
very
nice
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
in
the
flavor
and
feel
but
still
quite
strong
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
aftertaste
everything
else
is
very
well
done
nothing
really
stands
out
but
noting
to
complain
about
either
a
solid
offering
pours
a
lovely
golden
amber
looking
like
a
mead
or
a
pilsner
with
lightly
foaming
white
suds
the
nose
reveals
something
quite
different
then
the
pilsner
expectations
you
may
have
had
grape
and
honey
with
alcoholic
undertones
intriging
the
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
grapes
saffron
honey
you
can
taste
it
all
it
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
and
strong
to
put
away
several
at
a
sitting
but
it
is
outstanding
never
the
less
truely
an
ale
of
kings
the
recipe
is
based
on
2700
year
old
drinking
vessels
found
in
the
tomb
of
king
midas
it
is
a
smooth
sweet
but
dry
ale
can
be
compared
to
a
cross
between
a
wine
and
a
mead
which
is
more
accurate
since
way
back
when
wines
and
meads
were
made
i
found
it
refreshing
and
tasty
another
winner
from
the
head
of
dogfish
d
it
is
just
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
the
concept
is
very
cool
but
i
cant
say
ill
be
having
this
again
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
a
unique
beer
from
a
unique
brewery
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
often
but
i
do
enjoy
experimental
beers
like
this
pours
light
gold
in
color
with
no
head
forming
on
the
pour
at
all
smell
is
winelike
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
mead
like
qualities
coming
through
in
the
taste
a
very
different
beer
this
is
why
i
love
dogfish
head
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
good
mouthfeel
there
is
much
more
of
a
fruity
taste
coming
through
in
subsequent
sips
a
little
coatingcloying
but
doesnt
get
old
i
like
the
secrets
of
the
beverage
were
revealed
by
the
new
methods
of
molecular
archaeology
dr
patrick
mcgovern
of
the
museum
discovered
that
the
residues
inside
the
vessels
belonged
to
a
phrygian
cocktail
which
combined
grape

texture
the

is

directly
in

taste

taste
is
much
of
the

sweet
all
around
with
honey
overpowering
any

taste
this
almost
seems
like
a

the
grape

are
apparent

i
just
dont

what
to

of
it
this

out

from

ive
ever
had
and
i

i
would
get
again
but
i
think
once
is
enough

im
not

that

but
there
is

of
the

and
the

are
vivid
here

i
was

a

the

are
just

over

there
is
little

to

brewing

beer
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
fizzy
just
off
white
head
that
dissipates
after
not
too
long
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
the
white
grapes
and
honey
coming
through
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
honey
folled
by
the
grape
flavor
which
echoes
raison
dextra
a
bit
because
of
its
raisin
flavor
still
the
taste
still
says
beer
despite
these
unfamiliar
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
bodied
with
very
lively
carbonation
due
to
all
of
the
residual
sugar
and
the
sweetness
hides
the
abv
very
well
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
interesting
but
not
sticky
being
neither
tart
i
assume
thats
the
saffron
the
taste
is
very
sweet
as
well
and
some
strange
spice
flavors
im
not
sure
if
its
the
style
but
it
taste
more
like
a
wine
to
me
than
a

is

dr

that

golden

a

with
a

from
a

the
aroma
is
a

the
taste
is
really
interesting
kind
of
fruity
honey
is
noticeable
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
kind
of
a
malty
sweet
beer
i
would
say
i
wouldnt
drink
it
often
but
its
really
pretty
good
i
would
have
to
recommend
trying
it
but
personally
one
bottle
is
enough
i
dont
need
a
four
pack
cheers
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
honey
and
muscat
flavor
lots
of
spice
comes
through
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
sharp
drinkability
is
high
the
big
alcohol
is
not
detected
at
all
this
beer
was
an
intersting
beer
to
say
the
least
it
poured
a
honey
color
body
with
a
white
head
that
disipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
where
very
strongly
filled
with
honey
i
really
couldnt
detect
anything
else
well
maybe
but
i
have
no
clue
what
saffron
smells
or
tastes
like
im
pretty
poor
so
i
could
of
detected
some
of
that
just
not
known
it
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
light
a
carbonated
the
taste
lingered
a
while
it
was
a
slow
beer
that
was
extremely
similar
to
a
mead
my
friend
made
with
a
belgian
strain
of
yeast
as
the
starter
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
had
a
goldenlt
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
fair
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
doesnt
have
your
average
beer
smell
it
actually
smells
closer
to
mead
or
even
wine
but
it
is
a
great
sweet
smell
taste
is
really
good
but
one
is
enough
as
the
sweetness
would
tend
to
overpower
also
has
9
alcohol
so
that
should
stop
you
at
one
anyway
a
great
beer
they
call
it
an
elixir
to
try
once
2namln
d
i
honest
think
if
you
try
and
do
anymore
than
sip
this
beer
your
head
will
blow
from
that
intense
finish
or
youll
choke
this
would
be
a
fun
one
to
keep
around
and
share
with
some
good
friends
while
enjoying
a
good
conversation
i
could
not
bear
to
finish
this
drink
the
egyptians
may
have
invented
beer
but
its
obvious
that
their
recipe
had
changed
for
a
reason
this
beer
is
absolutely
retched
i
first
saw
this
beer
on
pbs
as
they
deciphered
an
ancient
beer
recipe
worthy
of
a
taste
if
only
to
taste
history
notes
i
liked
it
it
wasnt
something
ill
pursue
i
have
to
thank
my
wife
for
lugging
this
back
from
the
east
coast
on
her
recent
trip
to
boston
a
truly
unique
brew
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
here
and
id
definitely
like
to
try
it
again
at
some
point
while
i
wasnt
drinking
with
food
ill
bet
this
would
be
excellent
with
indian
food
many
types
of
greek
and
middle
eastern
dishes
and
lots
of
desserts
especially
anything
with
honey
thanks
rwitter
for
the
opportunity
sam
states
in
his
book
that
midas
touch
was
initially
brewed
primarily
to
appeal
to
wine
drinkers
and
that
he
expected
sales
to
come
from
that
demographic
for
the
most
part
im
certain
that
time
has
proven
that
this
beer
survives
not
due
to
the
support
of
the
wine
community
but
because
of
craft
beer
lovers
dfh
always
has
a
different
stroke
for
a
different
folk
but
why
does
the
label
say
ancient
ale
and
ba
say
herb
beer
drinkability
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
however
id
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
it
like
a
regular
session
beer
its
a
special
occasion
beer
for
me
but
then
i
had
to
beg
borrow
and
steal
to
get
some
as
its
not
available
in
my
area
so
take
that
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
pours
a
traditional
dark
amber
color
the
smell
is
impressive
mostly
like
dark
malts
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
pretty
original
a
lot
like
the
dark
malts
but
there
are
a
few
spices
and
things
added
that
make
it
unique
it
a
lot
of
ways
a
corianderlike
taste
gives
it
a
light
touch
while
the
hops
give
it
a
lingering
taste
on
the
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
would
call
it
a
mead
a
high
breed
of
braggot
metheglin
pyment
the
complexity
of
the
beer
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
more
it
is
a
little
unusual
so
i
like
this
as
a
beer
to
end
the
evening
not
as
a
session
beer
golden
color
no
head
at
all
but
im
not
sure
its
supposed
to
have
one
what
do
you
compare
and
ancient
egyptian
ale
too
smell
of
honey
sweetness
taste
is
also
very
sweet
the
grapes
really
show
up
in
the
taste
giving
it
an
almost
winelike
quality
finishes
with
a
note
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
alone
nothing
about
it
made
me
say
wow
but
hats
off
to
dogfish
for
even
trying
something
like
this
taste
begins
with
a
slippery
fruit
juice
and
honey
tone
and
melds
into
a
prickly
alcohol
coated
hop
bath
sweetness
is
perceived
only
for
a
flash
in
the
middle
the
brew
ends
with
a
organic
grain
laden
aftertaste
taste
is
not
all
that
complex
and
is
reminiscent
of
watered
down
fruit
juice
a
hopped
fruit
juice
not
what
i
expected
but
it
isnt
a
total
loss
worth
a
try
at
best
alchohol
esters
are
noticable
right
away
slightly
malty
with
spicy
tones
grape
sweetness
along
with
hints
of
honey
and
grainy
maltyness
nice
dry
finish
honestly
not
as
strange
as
i
was
expecting
sweet
spicy
flavor
a
bit
slick
on
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
an
interesting
flavor
that
is
fairly
drinkable
all
things
concidered
not
a
typical
beer
at
all
but
i
like
the
historical
value
of
this
beer
a
taste
of
what
it
may
have
been
like
long
ago
pours
honey
colored
with
an
average
white
head
the
smell
is
amazingly
complex
grapes
are
prominent
fruits
sugars
and
malts
and
lots
of
other
things
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
of
this
brew
evolved
quite
a
bit
from
start
to
finish
at
first
i
tasted
lots
of
honey
and
barley
malt
then
some
strange
caramely
tastes
that
reminded
me
of
some
sort
of
fruity
nutty
candybar
but
those
flavors
gave
way
to
sweet
white
wine
and
fruits
however
those
flavors
were
overpowed
by
ciderysugary
alcohol
midway
through
the
glass
which
really
hurt
drinkability
also
im
not
sure
i
tasted
any
saffron
which
seemed
like
a
waste
to
me
since
saffron
is
expensive
the
mouthfeel
was
thing
and
slightly
syupy
with
mediumlow
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
strange
brew
indeed
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
is
not
on
my
christmas
list
opinion
this
beer
is
an
experience
and
one
that
i
think
that
everyone
that
fancies
themselves
as
a
beer
aficionado
should
try
even
though
it
is
an
anomaly
of
beer
and
really
isnt
much
of
a
beer
at
all
it
is
still
something
to
challenge
your
palate
i
am
enjoying
the
mix
of
flavor
but
i
also
know
that
one
will
do
me
for
a
while
i
would
like
to
let
this
one
sit
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
the
fruit
mellows
and
the
spiciness
comes
out
it
really
needs
to
age
cool
so
i
will
hopefully
have
an
update
to
this
post
in
a
year
or
so
d
apart
from
those
who
dislike
sweet
beers
any
beer
lover
should
enjoy
this
beer
and
find
it
highly
drinkable
it
would
be
interesting
to
give
this
beer
to
a
pure
white
wine
drinker
to
see
what
they
had
to
say
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
years
ago
when
the
allure
of
drinking
ancient
brew
let
me
smile
smugly
at
my
coorsdrinking
friends
and
when
i
had
a
bottle
tonight
the
recipe
still
has
that
mystique
for
me
some
may
say
its
the
hype
but
i
think
its
because
it
truly
is
a
different
beer
for
one
i
cant
decide
if
its
more
like
a
barleywine
or
a
mead
it
pours
like
an
elixer
but
more
silky
and
with
a
deep
gold
color
its
taste
reminds
me
of
a
mead
with
a
combination
of
fruity
tones
but
they
are
not
sweet
at
some
points
it
feels
like
a
wine
with
a
dry
grape
flavor
its
a
complex
beer
that
alters
as
you
drink
it
as
the
temperature
changes
and
as
the
alcohol
settles
in
its
a
nice
sipping
beer
but
i
think
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
something
like
a
stinky
cheese
drinkability
is
good
certainly
not
a
quaffable
beer
but
nice
sip
this
as
an
after
dinner
drink
mk
interesting
beer
perhaps
good
for
a
nightcap
pours
a
clean
clear
light
amber
color
with
barely
any
head
that
dissipates
into
a
whisper
aromas
of
riesling
honey
and
an
overall
impression
of
sweetness
flavors
of
honey
a
little
maltiness
and
like
a
sweet
wine
no
hops
detected
saffron
is
hard
to
discern
very
sweet
like
a
tripel
but
more
wine
like
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
describe
because
its
not
very
beer
like
at
all
would
be
a
perfect
dessert
beverage
and
digestive
okay
i
have
to
say
that
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
as
i
have
read
high
remarks
on
it
as
it
comes
from
a
brewery
that
has
produced
so
many
great
beers
but
when
i
actually
sat
down
and
tasted
it
i
felt
a
bit
disappointed
not
cause
it
wasnt
good
but
because
it
was
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
the
colour
was
beautiful
almost
like
an
orange
honey
colour
the
smell
was
heavy
but
not
overpowering
then
came
the
taste
i
couldnt
really
pick
out
one
specific
taste
but
the
alcohol
bite
was
very
noticeable
almost
too
much
similar
to
a
heavy
barleywine
beer
again
not
what
i
had
expected
from
this
beer
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
for
a
beer
of
only
9
it
gave
me
a
wallup
like
a
much
heavier
beer
would
so
i
would
say
that
the
alcohol
rating
was
a
bit
under
rated
i
have
mixed
feelings
if
i
would
consider
drinking
this
beer
again
perhaps
its
a
good
one
to
drink
after
a
good
dinner
sitting
on
the
porch
with
friends
i
dont
think
this
will
make
my
top
15
beer
list
but
i
will
at
least
give
it
a
second
chance
color
is
a
clear
sparkling
golden
orange
head
is
short
creamy
and
just
a
bit
offwhite
retention
is
weak
aroma
is
very
sweet
honey
is
most
noted
mixed
with
malt
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
grape
taste
is
also
sweet
with
honey
being
the
most
apparent
flavor
grape
mixes
in
as
well
a
provides
a
fruity
edge
and
is
joined
by
a
mild
spice
flavor
alcohol
flavor
is
notable
especially
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
however
i
find
this
to
be
more
interesting
as
an
experiment
and
not
as
something
id
want
to
have
very
often
drinkability
very
good
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
although
a
case
will
run
you
60
in
pa
lots
of
caramel
and
sticky
vinous
flavors
raisin
and
honey
grapes
and
sweet
spice
finish
is
very
sticky
carmelized
sweet
raisin
lingers
lots
of
honey
did
i
mention
the
mouth
was
sticky
lots
of
big
flavors
not
alot
of
meshing
of
those
flavors
they
seem
to
battle
each
other
not
that
drinkable
an
interesting
beer
and
one
you
should
probably
experience
once
and
once
was
enough
for
me
the
body
is
big
and
makes
this
beer
unique
almost
like
a
dopplebock
without
the
yeasty
notes
i
think
this
is
as
good
as
an
example
of
a
malt
bomb
as
there
is
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
picking
up
another
4
pack
this
week
i
just
wish
it
had
more
substance
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
lack
of
foamy
head
i
poured
it
like
i
pour
all
of
my
beers
and
this
one
just
didnt
foam
up
otherwise
thats
my
only
complaint
nice
job
dfh
had
this
one
in
the
cellar
since
last
fall
probably
septemberoctober
pours
a
hazy
burnished
golde
with
a
thin
biege
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
the
aroma
has
notes
of
honey
fruits
pear
apple
white
grape
along
with
some
saffron
toasted
bread
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
honey
sweetness
along
with
some
fruits
pear
apple
white
grape
slight
hints
of
saffron
and
toasted
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
little
carbonation
drinkabilty
is
good
and
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
this
beer
has
lost
some
of
its
initial
complexity
while
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
a
good
and
interesting
beer
but
probably
not
one
to
cellar
the
uniqueness
is
appealing
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
now
for
something
different
kind
of
beer
it
is
a
very
rich
thick
brew
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
aromas
are
just
as
complex
as
the
flavors
i
definately
picked
out
the
honey
and
white
grapes
light
orange
color
mild
aroma
of
saffron
and
sweet
muscat
grapes
with
hints
of
honey
layered
fruits
and
booze
flavor
is
really
unique
and
hard
to
describe
strange
but
really
nicely
balanced
and
quite
tasty
as
well
rich
body
heavy
but
not
creamy
hint
of
caramel
and
toffee
muscat
grapes
and
saffron
with
a
definately
herbaceous
tone
light
notes
of
vanilla
and
honey
on
the
finish
md
surprisingly
refreshing
on
the
mouthfeel
thanks
to
the
subtlycarbonated
body
the
overall
body
is
more
than
full
yet
the
alc
hides
pretty
well
behind
the
malty
theme
but
the
structure
is
still
simplistic
all
in
all
this
is
a
barleywinestyle
beer
imo
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
i
suppose
some
ageing
might
bring
about
an
even
more
balanced
performance
still
this
is
a
fine
and
rare
hybrid
beer
i
feel
so
lucky
to
have
tastedall
credit
goes
to
steve
mouthfeel
is
prickly
tangy
and
much
much
bigger
than
the
inital
smellsight
would
have
you
believe
very
tasty
but
watch
for
that
9
i
could
have
a
few
but
the
flavor
kind
of
builds
up
to
be
a
little
much
still
okay
drinkability
this
beer
just
looked
pretty
a
nice
orangey
amber
mix
with
a
solid
but
fleeting
head
served
in
a
snifter
i
believe
or
whatever
the
90
minute
is
usually
served
in
the
smell
is
where
things
got
rocky
as
there
was
a
very
strong
astringent
alcoholcleaning
supply
fume
this
didnt
really
reflect
on
the
taste
but
the
taste
left
me
wondering
i
see
a
lot
of
the
reviews
on
here
got
very
fruity
and
i
got
some
fruits
in
the
end
but
not
before
some
strange
coffee
bitterness
followed
by
what
seemed
to
be
very
sweet
and
swirlin
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
chunkiness
there
but
that
is
welcomed
as
it
rounds
things
out
this
was
a
nice
sipper
which
paired
well
with
my
comfortable
chair
i
swear
and
this
went
down
without
a
hitch
i
might
get
it
again
sometime
once
i
know
more
about
the
beer
this
is
something
else
not
bad
not
at
all
but
too
intense
to
really
handle
i
would
say
this
is
an
eating
beer
though
and
would
be
great
with
a
nice
cheese
and
fruit
platter
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
an
airy
34
white
head
over
the
crystal
clear
light
golden
brew
head
fades
at
a
quick
pace
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
honey
sweet
with
a
touch
of
grapes
taste
is
upfront
pale
malts
then
the
dry
grape
essence
comes
in
and
lastly
the
alcohol
kicks
it
up
a
notch
leaving
a
somewhat
harsh
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
tough
due
to
the
alcohol
being
so
forward
and
drinkability
is
limited
by
that
and
the
fact
that
the
syrupiness
gets
to
grating
after
awhile
another
one
of
those
interesting
experiments
have
to
appreciate
what
theyre
trying
to
do
but
i
dont
have
to
go
there
again
a
very
special
offering
from
dfh
glad
i
was
able
to
get
some
when
it
came
to
houston
this
year
i
see
this
as
being
a
perennial
favorite
of
mine
drinkability
goes
down
like
cheap
white
wine
that
is
its
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
too
strong
i
was
interested
in
this
as
an
interserting
experiment
but
having
had
it
i
would
not
ever
get
this
again
grapey
alcoholey
aftertaste
not
very
drinkable
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
and
had
trouble
with
that
weird
beer
kind
of
a
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
champagne
like
feel
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
but
the
warming
affect
slowly
works
itself
into
the
picture
interesting
beer
and
definately
better
as
it
gets
warmer
there
is
so
much
going
on
though
that
one
in
a
sitting
is
about
all
im
good
for
i
could
never
drink
this
again
and
in
fact
the
only
things
keeping
me
for
pouring
this
right
now
are
a
the
fact
that
im
too
cheap
and
b
the
rapidly
disappearing
thought
that
i
should
pound
it
instead
drinkability
very
unusual
concoction
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
not
something
to
drink
in
quantity
but
i
am
saving
the
rest
of
the
bottle
to
complement
tonights
curried
roast
pork
with
mango
salsa
i
received
this
as
a
gift
for
designated
driving
a
few
carolina
brewmasters
to
the
hickory
hops
festival
this
one
was
well
worth
it
honestly
i
cannot
think
of
anything
to
make
this
one
taste
better
one
of
the
most
complex
tasting
beers
ive
ever
tried
spices
lots
of
honey
at
the
end
fruit
a
little
hoppy
just
beautiful
in
a
tulip
shaped
glass
im
really
falling
in
love
with
dogfish
head
quite
a
complex
beer
here
with
layers
of
easily
identifiable
strata
but
still
needing
to
be
explored
not
a
stand
alone
beer
id
like
to
have
this
with
a
grilled
salmon
fillet
or
something
good
effort
on
a
beer
with
tons
of
character
sampled
through
dnrobert24
and
2mbbif
drinkability
could
be
a
factor
because
of
the
somewhat
obscure
finish
leaves
a
gritty
dirty
tannic
taste
in
the
mouth
that
is
not
so
pleasant
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
overall
its
pretty
complex
and
i
can
smell
and
taste
alot
of
different
things
and
they
work
together
sort
of
well
however
im
left
with
a
feeling
that
there
should
or
could
be
more
these
flavors
should
meld
well
together
but
its
just
not
happening
for
me
ill
keep
a
few
around
to
age
man
this
beer
is
funky
it
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
little
head
the
smell
is
like
a
light
beer
the
taste
reveals
a
touch
of
honey
and
there
is
also
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
funny
bitter
feel
not
a
beer
i
think
i
will
have
again
this
brewer
is
putting
out
some
strange
brews
this
is
one
of
the
wilder
ones
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
good
so
this
might
be
similar
to
some
of
the
worlds
earliest
beers
not
bad
its
like
a
history
lesson
in
a
bottle
the
story
behind
the
drink
really
helps
the
drink
out
but
its
still
a
good
mead
wine
beer
hybrid
this
beer
pours
a
light
amberorangish
color
and
not
much
head
at
all
the
smell
is
of
the
grapes
and
saffron
definately
the
taste
is
very
characteristic
of
all
the
dogfish
head
beers
slightly
sweet
slightly
sour
with
a
very
distinct
yeast
flavor
its
a
good
novelty
brew
to
try
but
not
one
that
i
would
drink
often
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
the
honey
and
spice
create
a
front
and
the
buttery
diacetyl
carrie
the
malt
corn
and
concord
grape
over
the
tongue
and
in
the
finish
is
a
sweet
warmth
from
the
alcohol
and
a
piney
sap
bitter
linger
light
copper
with
rose
colored
hues
high
clarity
no
head
just
a
fine
light
ring
suspended
along
the
edges
that
remains
throughout
the
experience
delicate
streaming
bubbles
present
smell
is
faint
with
notes
of
bready
malt
candy
sweet
fruit
apples
grapes
and
light
spice
the
taste
is
very
sugary
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
honey
the
flavor
kind
of
gently
fades
into
a
slight
alcoholic
finish
that
is
a
bit
herbalplastic
unique
combination
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
almost
winelike
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
is
overly
sweet
with
nothing
to
balance
it
out
and
the
finish
is
unremarkable
interesting
and
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
this
is
quite
an
unusual
brew
a
hopped
honey
mead
this
brew
is
definitely
an
aquired
taste
this
might
be
a
good
summer
brew
im
really
intrigued
with
the
idea
of
a
great
brewery
like
dogfish
remaking
anceint
beer
recipes
drinkability
is
average
this
beer
is
so
unusual
that
it
makes
it
a
little
harder
than
normal
to
drink
but
i
think
it
could
grow
on
me
if
i
got
more
used
to
it
im
not
saying
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
its
simply
not
my
thing
and
maybe
my
palate
is
not
adventurous
enough
to
fully
enjoy
the
midas
touch
slick
feel
on
the
teeth
fairly
full
bodied
average
drinkability
for
a
less
than
average
beer
i
was
very
dissappointed
in
this
beer
at
almost
12
for
a
four
pack
i
feel
i
was
ripped
off
aftertaste
is
very
sweet
and
atypical
the
beer
is
quite
nice
but
not
one
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
the
taste
is
quite
heavy
i
dont
taste
the
9
but
i
do
feel
its
effects
and
moderation
is
advised
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
sugar
most
likely
from
the
muscat
grapesthey
are
very
sweet
but
possibly
honey
like
it
boasts
and
alcohol
the
hops
and
carbonation
are
the
first
thing
that
you
taste
there
is
sweet
fruity
sugarconfirming
that
it
is
mostly
the
grapes
giving
it
the
sweetness
in
the
body
of
the
beer
and
a
strange
but
good
finish
the
finish
remained
me
of
an
oaked
wine
or
a
bourbon
the
oak
was
prominent
slightly
spiced
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
really
helped
to
disguise
it
drinkabilitymouthfeel
drinkablility
is
above
average
for
this
beer
but
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
wine
in
general
in
might
not
be
up
your
alley
mouthfeel
is
very
much
of
a
slightly
carbonated
wine
and
does
have
some
bourbon
characters
another
interesting
brew
from
dogfish
they
always
keep
me
coming
back
an
interesting
beer
worth
the
experience
but
by
no
means
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
an
excellent
summer
drink
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
helps
hide
the
higher
abv
a
little
too
well
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
autumn
05
sitting
on
a
friends
porch
while
watching
a
parade
of
hundreds
of
runners
running
a
raleigh
road
race
glad
i
was
partaking
of
this
fine
brew
and
not
doing
all
that
running
all
in
all
an
awesome
brew
paired
with
a
light
plate
of
fruit
and
cheeses
with
success
this
brew
poured
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
small
head
the
beer
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
winey
spicy
and
i
could
also
pick
up
some
notes
of
malt
on
the
nose
taste
is
very
unusual
grapes
spices
grain
and
honey
were
all
present
in
the
flavor
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
in
the
palate
the
finish
was
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
times
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
beerwinemead
hybrid
isnt
that
the
point
behind
this
brew
to
sample
something
that
ancient
humans
may
have
partaken
of
i
dont
know
how
close
midas
touch
is
to
the
actual
product
that
was
inside
those
unearthed
vessels
but
its
worth
a
try
just
to
have
something
very
different
cheers
to
dogfish
head
for
putting
out
a
very
bold
product
the
uniqueness
and
complexity
of
this
drink
gives
something
beer
lovers
should
try
several
time
before
they
make
up
their
mind
the
background
spicyness
grows
as
one
drinks
this
and
it
contributes
to
a
cap
on
the
number
of
these
one
could
have
in
a
night
one
is
ok
two
is
good
three
may
be
great
but
four
in
a
row
is
likely
to
many
the
carbonation
and
grapes
combine
to
give
this
beer
a
pseudowine
or
champagne
like
feel
others
have
mentioned
this
beer
is
good
upon
occasion
or
if
one
is
in
the
right
mood
i
think
this
beer
should
be
approached
as
if
it
were
a
wine
or
champagne
any
gathering
where
alcohol
is
served
but
the
goal
isnt
be
get
trashed
is
a
good
time
to
bring
out
this
beer
theres
no
way
anyone
could
pound
these
they
sort
of
cap
themselves
but
before
you
get
sick
of
them
they
are
really
good
celebrate
its
uniqueness
at
celebrations
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
one
this
sweet
it
was
a
pretty
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
very
bubbly
it
had
a
sweet
grainy
odor
and
a
very
sweet
fruity
taste
i
thought
it
to
be
quite
carbonated
and
thus
not
very
pleasing
in
the
mouth
the
sweetness
makes
it
only
average
for
drinkability
this
pours
a
yellowred
straw
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
honey
sweetness
to
it
with
a
raisin
or
prune
aroma
also
the
taste
is
a
real
treat
it
starts
out
creamy
with
a
real
alcohol
bite
to
it
the
dark
fruitprune
and
raisinflavor
is
very
prevelant
with
a
almost
white
wine
presence
make
this
a
sweet
beer
that
is
goodbut
not
very
drinkable
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
good
malt
sweetness
that
really
hides
the
high
alcohol
this
is
an
ok
brewbut
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
the
pour
is
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
down
to
a
halo
this
has
a
appealing
aroma
when
im
not
getting
a
nose
full
of
alcohol
white
wine
honey
and
a
ton
of
spice
the
taste
is
off
and
on
in
the
same
way
in
one
sip
im
enjoying
the
honey
candysweet
malts
and
spices
in
an
another
sip
i
get
an
overly
alcoholic
cooking
white
wine
in
theory
the
flavors
should
join
forces
to
create
a
nice
riesling
taste
but
that
never
happens
all
in
all
midas
touch
a
fun
beer
to
try
because
of
its
unique
history
plus
its
from
a
brewery
that
id
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
while
thanks
bross242
cheers
in
all
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
its
a
pretty
good
beer
that
will
wear
out
its
welcome
by
2
so
stop
there
but
in
that
you
can
really
get
some
enjoyment
with
a
few
to
relax
with
pours
a
transparent
golden
amber
i
got
virtually
no
head
at
all
and
very
little
active
carbonation
appearance
of
a
hard
alcohol
such
as
whiskey
nose
was
very
fascinating
as
it
excites
the
palate
with
unusual
aromas
of
figs
raisins
white
wine
as
well
as
some
heavy
musk
laying
in
the
background
taste
is
completely
original
and
very
strong
sweetness
of
honey
with
tart
apple
and
grape
followed
with
a
dry
finish
which
includes
plenty
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
with
very
little
carbonation
which
is
a
shame
but
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
limited
by
a
9
abv
price
tag
but
the
backstory
on
this
ale
check
out
dogfish
com
makes
it
worth
a
try
an
excellent
quality
beer
tastes
are
quite
interesting
they
seem
to
vary
from
sip
to
sip
honey
grapes
alc
saffron
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
the
concept
is
a
good
one
however
that
being
said
this
is
beer
made
me
appreciate
all
the
progress
brewers
have
made
since
the
days
of
king
midas
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
its
something
completely
different
from
anything
else
ive
ever
had
and
for
that
reason
alone
i
believe
it
to
be
worth
trying
disappointed
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
definitely
very
wine
like
its
a
neat
idea
for
a
beer
and
the
execution
isnt
bad
its
almost
a
little
too
strong
overall
a
very
diffeent
beer
what
i
had
seen
on
the
history
channel
was
that
this
recipe
was
taken
from
scriptures
unearthed
from
a
tomb
believed
to
be
king
midass
so
no
hops
but
something
to
seek
out
for
the
adventurous
beer
afiucionado
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
golden
color
has
a
quarter
inch
head
that
goes
to
a
film
after
a
while
smells
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
tried
with
the
grapes
and
saffron
noticeable
taste
is
also
very
unique
has
some
characteristics
of
wine
taste
of
saffron
and
honey
very
different
from
other
beers
i
have
tired
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
that
bad
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
d
this
beer
is
very
soft
and
the
flavors
are
very
foreign
the
notes
of
grapes
are
distinct
but
faint
and
the
malt
is
very
soft
aswell
i
dont
taste
a
lot
of
depth
but
it
is
and
interesting
beer
and
it
starts
to
grow
on
me
after
awhile
one
important
note
even
though
i
find
this
brew
undrinkable
i
do
appreciate
dfhs
experimentation
and
imagining
beerloving
indiana
jones
in
search
of
king
midas
tomb
to
discover
the
secret
of
the
ancient
ale
is
just
plain
cool
ill
add
some
extra
points
to
mouthfeel
as
my
way
of
encouraging
dfhs
contant
search
for
new
and
cool
ideas
in
brewing
mouthefeel
is
kind
of
one
the
thin
side
but
its
one
easy
to
drink
beer
its
disappearing
before
my
eyes
this
is
a
hybrid
beer
mead
that
is
truly
an
undertaking
as
only
dfh
could
do
and
while
it
is
very
good
it
leaves
one
happy
to
be
alive
during
the
current
state
of
beer
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
into
experimenting
with
unique
styles
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
it
was
worth
my
time
and
money
drinkability
if
ever
the
term
sweet
and
sour
would
be
used
for
a
beer
this
would
be
it
very
interesting
style
that
leaves
you
wanting
another
tastes
like
it
could
be
a
great
poolside
beer
or
at
the
same
time
be
a
nice
beer
by
the
fire
this
beer
appears
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
soft
golden
color
and
just
a
bit
of
cream
colored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
honey
grains
bread
and
rice
come
to
mind
very
unique
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
honey
derived
sweetness
with
starch
derived
bitterness
that
just
rolls
over
the
tongue
and
leaves
behing
some
nice
spice
flavors
a
bit
too
dry
in
the
finish
for
its
texture
and
components
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
was
just
too
much
for
me
to
crave
more
than
one
of
these
cheers
i
hadnt
had
a
lot
of
luck
finding
dogfish
beers
that
i
would
rebuy
to
this
point
but
midas
touch
is
a
very
tasty
offering
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
people
who
love
sweeter
beers
with
the
malts
dominating
the
hops
i
love
dogfish
heads
brews
but
im
going
to
have
to
pass
on
this
one
the
next
time
im
at
my
local
store
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
high
carbonation
levels
drinkability
overall
a
nice
sweet
beer
that
was
very
different
ive
never
tasted
anything
like
this
before
an
expensive
brew
that
ever
beer
drinker
should
try
for
themselves
this
also
made
a
nice
representation
of
my
first
dogfish
head
brew
drinkability
is
on
a
par
with
mead
i
enjoy
one
when
i
go
the
the
renaissance
fair
every
year
but
dont
miss
it
in
between
its
sweetness
limits
it
to
a
single
serving
in
my
book
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
if
i
were
more
of
a
wine
person
i
might
enjoy
it
even
more
strange
brew
this
one
kind
of
smells
like
dirty
socks
as
it
warms
up
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
very
fine
carbonation
makes
it
way
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
taste
is
hard
to
describe
initial
thoughts
were
that
it
was
like
a
combination
of
beer
and
white
grape
juice
in
fact
that
thought
still
persists
so
thats
how
ill
describe
it
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
pretty
disappointing
for
the
price
really
like
i
said
i
am
thrilled
to
be
able
to
try
this
ancient
reproduction
but
it
really
isnt
anything
too
drinkable
much
less
good
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
anyway
due
to
the
backstory
not
recommended
for
anybody
but
history
buffs
music
judas
priest
defenders
of
the
faith
drinkability
this
is
a
very
tasty
drinkable
concoction
this
will
probably
be
able
to
replace
wine
with
a
meal
hell
if
you
have
wine
snobs
over
break
this
one
out
this
beer
will
puzzle
the
hell
out
of
them
i
bought
two
more
packs
for
cellaring
purposes
poured
a
sparkly
honeygolden
color
head
was
really
strange
in
that
is
popped
and
fizzed
yet
nearly
instantaneously
disappeared
quite
strange
lots
of
sweetness
in
the
nose
maybe
some
earthy
notes
and
spiced
grapes
flavor
pulls
a
lot
of
the
honey
flavor
out
malt
backbone
and
grape
wine
flavors
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
surprisingly
thick
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
a
different
beer
the
midas
touch
golden
elixir
might
very
well
be
a
great
crossover
beer
for
introducing
your
friends
to
craft
beers
it
is
smooth
very
drinkable
and
light
perfect
for
summer
or
fall
days
overall
this
is
a
very
sweet
little
ditty
but
it
just
doesnt
make
the
grade
when
price
is
factored
into
the
equation
a
perfect
drink
for
before
dinner
or
with
dinner
poultry
seems
like
it
would
fair
well
and
anything
with
fresh
herbs
would
bring
out
the
best
in
this
sipper
i
had
this
with
thanksgiving
dinner
not
for
complementing
flavors
but
for
a
delectible
drink
on
a
special
occassion
nevertheless
the
midas
touch
held
its
own
against
spice
rubbed
turkey
rosemary
flavored
stuffing
mashed
potatos
aromatic
sweet
potatos
tumeric
flavored
corn
and
pear
salad
in
fact
the
unintened
indiantype
flavors
in
the
meal
really
complemented
the
beer
as
it
warmed
up
the
only
thing
that
drowned
out
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
the
cranberry
relish
md
at
9
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
first
experience
with
this
type
so
i
have
nothing
to
gauge
it
against
worth
a
try
i
could
definitely
enjoy
several
of
these
with
something
on
the
dry
side
in
between
the
sweetness
makes
it
prohibitive
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
row
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
its
a
very
interesting
unique
beer
from
dogfish
i
most
lilkely
wont
buy
it
again
though
its
a
little
too
potent
and
sweet
for
me
and
in
its
place
id
rather
drink
a
nice
dessert
wine
or
port
pours
a
dark
honey
color
that
is
slightly
murky
with
a
smooth
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
doughy
with
a
bit
of
teriyaki
theres
also
a
bit
of
citrus
and
pear
but
i
still
get
a
bit
of
teriyaki
but
not
in
a
bad
way
much
maltier
than
i
expected
in
flavor
with
noticable
alcohol
theres
a
plumb
flavor
that
fits
well
with
the
maltiness
this
beer
finishes
very
well
with
an
almost
electric
lingering
sourness
and
spice
that
dances
on
the
tongue
this
flavor
leaves
the
mouth
with
almost
chocolate
taste
to
it
wonderfully
complex
and
dynamic
very
thick
mouth
feel
that
is
deceptively
carbonated
im
thinking
this
would
go
well
with
a
smoked
gouda
i
dont
know
if
id
have
two
of
these
in
a
night
but
its
a
very
well
done
brew
it
had
the
aroma
of
some
citrus
somewhat
malty
hints
and
sweet
fruits
the
taste
however
immediately
hit
me
with
spices
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
taste
it
wasnt
overpowering
but
definitely
there
it
started
bitter
and
ended
up
pleasantly
sweet
can
truly
say
it
was
a
taste
i
had
never
encountered
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
definiely
a
beer
to
be
served
somewhat
chilled
i
have
to
respect
the
creativity
dogfish
head
has
and
the
chances
they
take
in
brewing
it
often
leads
to
exciting
things
this
being
one
of
them
oh
yeah
and
i
paid
18
for
four
of
these
kill
me
nice
and
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
at
3bottle
an
interesting
brew
but
not
sure
i
would
drink
it
again
i
think
the
honey
was
a
bit
overpowering
but
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
once
slick
but
not
overly
thick
heavy
the
carbonation
is
next
to
nonexistant
a
very
tasty
sipper
drinkability
definately
not
a
session
beer
not
due
to
the
alcohol
but
to
the
sweetness
and
complexity
my
taste
buds
were
worn
out
after
this
one
still
it
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
very
good
the
flavor
mouthfeel
and
aroma
all
scream
too
young
mead
to
me
its
hot
harsh
and
not
something
i
care
to
drink
again
perhaps
cellared
for
a
year
or
two
it
would
be
wonderful
if
i
ever
buy
another
bottle
it
will
be
with
that
in
mind
the
beer
after
its
disinterment
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
modest
off
white
head
and
the
lace
a
thin
veil
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
has
the
aroma
of
honey
quite
sweet
with
a
slight
hint
of
fusel
alcohol
also
a
bit
grassy
start
is
sweet
with
a
bountiful
grain
presence
and
the
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
determined
acidity
the
hops
pleasantly
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
dry
alcohol
warming
noticed
a
quite
nice
beer
as
i
need
a
big
beer
today
drinkabiilty
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
metheglin
with
its
strong
honey
flavors
and
spiciness
it
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
that
but
this
kind
of
defies
being
labelled
hey
i
rated
it
even
lower
this
time
around
aint
that
a
hoot
a
unique
brew
from
dogfish
head
poured
out
to
a
deep
dark
gold
color
with
a
hint
of
amber
in
it
head
was
rather
short
lived
but
a
very
thin
layer
of
foam
remained
after
a
minute
no
lacing
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroma
was
similar
to
a
monster
energy
drink
scents
of
herbs
honey
earth
and
sweet
spice
were
all
present
with
only
a
touch
of
malt
toward
the
middle
taste
was
good
but
also
different
flavors
of
buttery
fruit
floral
notes
and
grain
were
all
present
and
well
received
some
minor
malt
and
earthy
characters
were
also
present
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
thicker
syrup
like
character
present
giving
the
beer
a
touch
of
viscosity
decent
drinkability
this
beer
is
probably
not
one
youd
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
likely
one
youd
want
to
revisit
recommended
pours
a
golden
amber
slightly
cloudy
with
a
finger
of
white
creamy
foam
in
my
chalice
fit
for
a
king
smell
is
spicyherbal
up
front
like
baked
goods
taste
starts
with
the
spicy
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
subtle
clove
very
similar
to
their
punkin
ale
then
belgian
pale
fruit
ending
in
a
unique
saffron
tickle
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
syrupy
but
refreshing
an
interesting
mix
of
punkin
ale
spiciness
with
some
unique
belgian
like
notes
i
could
drink
a
few
but
thats
about
it
more
than
just
a
quirky
concept
but
not
transcendent
well
im
reviewing
this
dfh
offering
in
my
dfh
pint
glass
that
i
received
as
a
part
of
a
trade
about
a
year
ago
pretty
sure
i
got
the
glass
from
sulldaddy
as
part
of
secret
santa
04
the
beer
was
obtained
from
total
beverage
as
it
just
appeared
on
the
shelves
there
im
guessing
this
was
recently
brewed
by
dfh
pours
a
one
finger
mostly
white
but
partly
drab
yellow
head
the
beer
itself
is
a
midly
cloudy
light
pumpkin
orange
with
some
particulates
suspended
within
smells
oh
stingy
rough
alcohol
pumpkin
sweet
malty
and
sweet
esters
some
caramel
wax
tastes
sweet
esters
sweet
amlt
thick
body
with
a
rough
alcohol
ending
this
is
a
really
rich
malty
beer
and
ill
bet
it
would
age
really
well
said
to
be
brewed
with
honey
grapes
and
saffron
i
dont
see
the
honey
or
grapes
and
i
dont
know
what
saffron
tastes
like
i
guess
i
just
get
a
malty
dark
flavor
with
a
hint
of
spicy
flower
and
a
late
alcohol
burn
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
an
okay
beer
that
needs
time
for
the
alcohol
to
settle
and
malty
sweet
to
develop
john
notes
wierd
beer
one
that
i
definitely
dont
hate
but
also
dont
love
however
because
its
such
a
unique
flavor
i
can
see
having
an
itch
to
drink
this
every
now
and
then
all
in
all
good
just
not
the
first
or
second
beer
id
pick
for
the
price
on
most
trips
to
the
store
12
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
clear
copped
color
the
aroma
is
candy
sweetness
with
grapes
like
the
grapes
in
grape
juice
this
beer
tastes
really
weird
it
took
me
a
while
to
figure
out
if
i
like
it
or
not
it
sort
of
has
a
cream
ale
malt
flavor
that
i
dont
like
its
much
stronger
than
a
cream
ale
though
and
i
do
enjoy
the
fruity
grape
flavor
some
honey
sweetness
too
this
beer
isnt
great
but
its
certainly
unique
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
and
expensive
for
me
but
very
interesting
considering
the
backstory
this
brew
ours
a
deep
golden
honey
with
a
quickly
fading
head
no
lace
aroma
is
of
grapes
and
honey
i
get
more
of
a
green
grape
juice
sweetness
to
this
than
the
honey
saffron
couldnt
find
it
or
anything
that
could
be
considered
saffron
taste
is
smooth
honey
green
grapes
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
sticky
on
the
lips
and
a
bit
warming
in
the
belly
be
a
good
winter
beer
when
the
cold
winds
blow
for
a
high
abv
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
to
sip
on
while
im
lost
in
t
v
land
or
just
chillintastey
finish
is
long
and
lemony
sweet
tasty
cant
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
tho
however
this
is
a
singular
beer
and
its
more
worth
a
shot
than
most
as
this
is
a
rarity
for
the
most
part
as
far
as
beers
like
this
try
it
definitely
dfh
continues
to
experiment
and
ill
buy
anything
they
put
out
because
theyre
tenacious
and
really
sometimes
it
seems
like
they
dont
give
a
shit
about
how
everyones
going
to
take
it
and
i
love
that
about
them
note
that
midas
touch
is
another
name
for
grog
a
mix
of
beer
wine
juice
and
honey
thats
actually
pretty
much
what
this
is
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
a
bright
copper
color
with
just
a
touch
of
a
fizzy
white
head
decent
carbonation
in
the
form
of
tiny
tiny
bubbles
interesting
aroma
all
ingredients
stated
on
the
bottle
come
through
especially
the
muscat
grapes
hints
of
saffron
honey
malt
and
a
general
sweetness
pervade
the
nose
palate
is
even
more
interesting
sweet
with
honey
and
grapes
offset
slightly
by
the
sweet
malt
and
herby
saffron
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
from
the
honey
but
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
big
alcohol
kick
from
the
start
makes
this
a
longtime
sipping
beer
nice
and
very
interesting
beer
has
no
limits
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
can
get
a
single
bottle
rather
than
a
fourpack
i
split
this
with
another
ba
and
we
had
a
bit
of
trouble
drinking
it
the
different
taste
texture
and
high
alcohol
warrants
you
from
drinking
this
more
than
twice
a
year
this
beer
was
good
but
i
dont
know
if
id
reccomend
this
to
everyone
medium
bodied
sticksweet
and
almost
syruplike
texture
interesting
and
tastey
but
no
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
thanks
to
ski271
for
the
bottle
imbibability
a
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
gets
a
bit
thick
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
to
the
point
that
its
trying
drinkability
this
is
a
weird
one
for
sure
wasnt
sure
if
i
liked
it
at
first
but
once
i
knew
what
to
expect
it
was
much
more
enjoyable
its
surprisingly
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
especially
considering
that
its
9
this
is
a
mood
beer
something
id
enjoy
on
a
rare
occasion
and
thats
a
good
thing
considering
its
price
but
it
was
a
pleasant
break
from
the
norm
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
beer
is
difficult
to
rate
because
it
is
so
strange
dogfish
head
continues
too
impress
me
with
their
creativity
though
shame
i
cant
make
it
to
bocce
picked
up
a
single
12
oz
bottle
for
4
bucks
steep
but
my
curiosity
got
to
me
pours
a
hazy
murky
gold
with
light
carbonation
looks
like
a
big
glass
of
honey
actually
strong
aroma
of
pure
fermented
honey
the
fermented
semisweet
honey
is
the
first
and
strongest
flavor
white
grape
is
next
up
with
only
a
bit
of
malty
ale
character
noticeable
in
the
end
alcohol
warmth
is
strong
and
lasting
seems
to
be
a
mead
first
then
a
wine
and
a
beer
more
of
a
braggot
than
anything
else
bleeding
edge
weird
experimental
beer
this
is
not
something
you
could
drink
often
but
is
certainly
worth
a
try
its
quite
a
neat
drinkthing
its
somewhat
meadlike
but
more
like
a
braggot
with
the
carbonation
and
dainty
head
aromas
are
right
on
a
chardonay
with
honey
and
sweet
spices
tastes
also
chardonay
like
with
more
sweetness
corriander
allspice
and
some
others
that
i
cant
describe
high
alcohol
boarders
on
phenolic
quite
perfumy
and
sweetly
tart
throughout
a
well
formed
experiment
i
like
it
though
only
on
occasions
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
certainly
worth
a
try
but
for
myself
personal
wouldnt
buy
repeatedly
for
the
price
goldenyellow
color
with
no
real
head
but
plenty
of
bubbles
something
like
a
dark
champagne
smells
of
hops
honey
on
the
nose
strongly
and
very
appealing
tastes
roughly
the
same
with
some
malts
and
hoppiness
quickly
giving
away
to
honeymead
tastes
and
very
decent
acidityfeel
very
drinkable
for
a
nineer
and
two
bottles
went
missing
between
innocent
looking
friends
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
the
aroma
is
buttery
bread
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
will
surprise
you
at
first
it
is
spicy
like
gingerale
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
there
is
a
good
deal
of
alcoholic
taste
in
there
as
well
i
found
it
kind
of
hard
to
finish
as
the
alcohol
flavor
was
so
high
definitely
not
your
typical
beer
drinkability
yikes
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
itll
put
you
in
a
fog
if
youre
not
ready
for
it
id
recommend
this
as
an
afterdinner
drink
this
beer
is
very
different
from
other
beers
and
just
as
different
from
dfhs
other
brews
it
is
very
much
worth
the
high
price
and
is
a
great
beer
for
special
occasions
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
this
could
use
a
little
more
body
however
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
goes
down
like
water
i
could
see
myself
finishing
off
a
four
pack
quickly
well
probably
too
quickly
at
9
another
well
done
experimental
brew
from
sam
dfh
i
hope
they
keep
up
the
good
work
the
taste
was
sweetness
up
front
from
the
grape
and
honey
that
finished
slightly
dry
from
the
alcohol
very
wine
like
at
its
essence
very
enjoyable
but
sneaks
up
on
you
kind
of
a
bizarre
beer
i
had
wanted
to
try
it
simply
because
of
its
background
pours
a
light
clear
amber
with
little
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
like
i
dont
know
dried
apricots
malty
earthy
alcohol
and
kind
of
grapy
very
hard
to
place
i
thought
tastes
sweet
can
taste
the
alcohol
kind
of
winish
can
taste
the
grape
influence
at
the
end
of
the
sip
beer
was
pretty
smooth
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
would
maybe
try
this
again
however
the
novelty
has
worn
off
honestly
worth
a
try
though
very
different
thanks
joeyc
winey
aroma
lace
hoppy
plumb
white
grape
content
alcohol
drying
that
cleas
the
palate
meadiness
if
i
want
fruit
wine
i
will
have
that
if
i
want
mead
i
will
obtain
that
apple
taste
on
finish
i
guess
unique
with
some
dinner
ok
had
it
thanks
joeyc
i
can
barely
finish
this
one
i
feel
the
need
to
shoot
up
some
insulin
by
the
middle
of
the
glass
way
too
much
sweets
not
sure
how
to
take
this
beer
i
look
at
it
as
almost
a
braggot
meadbeer
mix
due
to
the
honey
in
it
its
great
that
way
looks
like
a
lightly
carbonated
well
mead
slightly
spicy
aroma
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
probably
saffron
except
im
not
sure
what
saffron
smells
like
taste
is
really
interesting
and
well
layered
first
taste
is
beer
like
slight
hop
bite
there
then
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
aftertaste
i
really
pick
up
the
sweet
muscat
grapes
full
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
burn
that
i
can
pick
up
on
well
put
together
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
chalice
dn
a
nice
beer
to
try
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
anytime
soon
tasty
and
would
never
know
that
it
packs
the
punch
that
it
does
always
enjoyed
the
750s
of
it
shared
750ml
bottle
with
fellow
ba
mtanji
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
there
was
absolutely
no
smell
the
taste
pretty
much
mathced
the
smell
because
there
was
no
taste
either
mouthfeel
was
of
alcohol
i
wonder
if
this
bottle
went
bad
a
one
finger
frothy
head
sits
atop
a
clear
golden
honey
colored
beer
few
streams
of
carbonation
were
seen
aromas
detected
started
with
honey
fruit
grapes
spice
and
a
slight
sourness
the
taste
was
a
complex
mixture
of
malt
and
spice
wine
and
candy
a
mouthful
ends
with
a
nice
honey
coating
on
the
mouth
very
smooth
beer
here
a
great
session
beer
but
too
rich
to
drink
one
after
another
in
my
opinion
this
peer
poured
a
crystalclear
orangish
yellow
a
bit
more
umm
lumiscent
than
most
beers
the
saffron
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
a
bock
with
some
sweet
honey
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
grape
around
the
edge
giving
it
a
fruit
note
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
meadish
but
with
the
muscat
grape
having
a
fairly
strong
presence
in
a
good
way
unlike
say
corcordes
concord
grape
ale
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
its
a
fairly
pleasant
beer
but
with
a
funky
enough
taste
that
its
a
bit
low
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
e
one
of
these
is
plenty
itll
be
awhile
before
i
finish
the
4pack
this
is
a
strange
wild
intriguing
beer
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
sweet
mead
and
a
bock
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
orange
color
with
a
sodapop
head
the
aroma
is
distinctly
honeylike
with
a
strong
alcohol
background
also
mingling
in
the
smell
are
fruit
and
spicesapple
grape
pepper
sugar
the
taste
is
intensely
sweet
with
a
serious
honey
quality
its
a
relatively
heavy
brew
and
i
dont
think
that
id
be
able
to
have
too
many
its
interesting
and
worth
a
try
its
actually
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
but
this
ones
not
something
id
seek
out
cheers
a
chilled
12
oz
bottle
from
a
4
pack
label
notched
jan
no
year
from
corral
liquors
the
color
is
a
pale
slightly
hazed
orange
the
aromas
of
honey
grape
skins
tart
sweet
white
grapes
and
alcohol
spiciness
saffron
the
head
dissipated
very
quickly
with
some
patchy
lace
the
carbonation
is
low
strong
nearly
astringant
alcohol
warming
on
the
swallow
this
beer
merges
with
wine
in
its
characteristics
like
a
snail
crawl
along
the
edge
of
a
straight
razor
that
cuts
beer
from
wine
dfhs
sweet
midas
crawls
slithering
along
the
edge
of
a
straight
razor
and
survives
as
a
beer
very
little
hop
or
malt
flavors
present
super
sweet
sugary
honey
flavor
with
roasted
earthy
grains
in
the
background
buttery
from
an
high
diacetyl
but
tollerable
with
the
sweetness
provided
by
the
grapes
hops
provide
a
nearly
herbal
spice
corriander
and
citrus
the
aftertaste
is
dry
tart
and
crisp
a
moderatetofull
body
with
9
abv
but
drinkable
if
you
like
sweet
liquids
suggest
you
try
one
from
tap
or
just
a
single
bottle
many
reviewers
have
asked
to
have
the
curse
of
the
midas
touch
removed
finding
it
too
overwhelming
probably
the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
a
mead
i
didnt
really
notice
to
much
in
the
way
of
grapes
but
this
beer
seemed
busy
enough
as
is
interesting
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
one
ill
look
for
for
me
drinkability
is
low
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
i
am
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
and
would
try
it
again
if
i
found
it
on
tap
the
color
is
very
nice
a
very
rich
honey
appearance
that
sprouted
a
light
bubbly
head
that
faded
to
a
circle
around
edge
slightly
cloudy
the
aroma
is
less
sweet
than
i
was
anticipating
the
flavor
is
kind
of
earthy
with
subtle
fruit
notes
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
much
drinkable
although
not
a
session
beer
very
unique
and
definetly
worth
a
try
yet
another
big
beer
from
dfh
this
one
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
fell
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
smells
like
bread
and
honey
a
good
combination
the
distince
flavor
of
honey
and
alcohol
at
the
start
then
a
nice
malty
near
the
end
and
finally
a
bit
of
hop
bite
to
cap
it
off
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
with
good
carbonation
and
smooth
feel
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
drinking
this
one
again
the
appearance
is
a
very
beautiful
hazy
copper
with
a
very
thin
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
and
has
a
strong
rotting
fruit
backbone
i
can
also
smell
the
phenols
with
a
belgian
touch
the
taste
is
strange
but
enjoyable
there
is
a
sour
start
followed
by
a
candied
sugar
taste
the
honey
really
shines
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
burning
sensation
left
on
my
tongue
it
almost
felt
raw
after
a
few
sips
either
way
i
cant
let
that
deter
me
from
saying
this
is
one
interesting
beer
that
everyone
should
try
to
experience
i
dont
know
if
i
would
be
buying
this
by
the
bottle
in
the
future
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
donly
problem
here
high
abv
and
not
a
style
where
you
want
more
than
one
at
1st
taste
i
thoght
i
wasted
13
00
for
this
4
pack
and
as
the
beer
warmed
we
got
to
be
friends
poured
golden
amber
with
no
head
aroma
honey
grapes
alcohol
white
wine
fruity
flavor
honey
fruity
alcohol
very
strong
had
to
check
bottle
to
make
sure
i
was
drinking
beer
and
not
wine
this
would
go
well
with
stir
fry
chicken
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
blended
nicely
not
a
bad
beer
to
sip
but
not
particularly
compelling
either
at
9abv
i
dont
think
it
would
make
a
particularly
good
session
brew
drinkability
its
interesting
enough
to
keep
taking
sips
of
as
one
decides
what
it
is
exactly
that
is
being
tasted
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
a
six
pack
or
even
a
four
pack
as
dfh
packages
them
its
an
interesting
beer
or
something
close
to
beer
id
reccommend
everyone
try
one
so
they
can
reference
other
obscure
styles
by
it
gruit
seems
rather
similar
pours
pale
orange
shouldnt
something
named
midas
be
gold
at
least
under
a
very
thin
13
finger
off
white
head
that
fizzles
as
quickly
as
it
forms
purely
from
the
appearance
it
reminds
me
of
some
pretty
bad
russian
beers
of
the
zhigulovskoye
line
the
nose
is
well
distinctive
grape
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
spice
i
assume
thats
the
safron
and
slightly
sour
these
are
not
good
images
here
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
quite
thickheavy
presumably
from
the
fruit
juice
taste
oh
my
grapes
and
safron
are
definitely
noticeable
sweet
and
sour
almost
like
grape
juice
on
drugs
theres
definitely
malt
here
and
even
a
dash
of
coniferous
hops
that
lends
a
dry
bit
element
to
the
finish
but
this
tastes
and
feels
much
more
like
a
mead
than
a
beer
not
a
very
good
mead
either
glad
i
got
just
one
as
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
even
that
much
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
this
dogfish
offering
many
good
things
i
have
heard
it
poured
with
a
big
inconsistent
head
that
was
quick
to
dissipate
and
a
beautiful
amber
body
the
honey
malt
aroma
is
enticing
to
say
the
least
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
seductive
leaves
you
yearning
the
honey
and
saffron
walz
together
on
the
palate
in
perfect
fashion
from
the
mouthfeel
to
the
finish
is
magnificent
a
grape
winelike
flavor
kicks
in
while
the
taste
buds
continue
to
be
pulled
in
several
different
directions
absolutely
a
winner
what
a
beer
12
oz
bottle
packaged
in
month
6
according
to
the
notch
pours
a
slighlty
hazy
orange
with
a
white
thick
head
the
head
disappeared
almost
immediately
some
tiny
bubbles
still
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
lace
smells
like
a
white
wine
grapes
slight
spicy
and
earthy
smell
very
sweet
up
front
from
the
honey
as
it
warms
a
bit
more
of
the
spicy
flavors
come
out
very
thick
on
the
palate
but
fairly
low
carbonation
not
much
bitterness
here
mostly
honey
sweetness
an
interesting
experiment
not
something
to
have
all
of
the
time
suffers
in
drinkability
still
worht
a
try
very
drinkable
at
a
respectable
9
0
abv
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
head
that
barely
hangs
around
to
say
hello
aroma
is
immdiately
interesting
strong
honey
aroma
but
i
also
detect
a
lot
of
that
grape
fruitiness
with
some
faint
spice
sneaking
up
from
behind
taste
is
a
marvel
a
lot
of
grape
flavor
mixed
with
a
bit
of
honey
which
is
all
backed
up
by
a
warm
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
i
can
only
drink
1
bottle
of
this
a
night
but
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
coming
back
often
as
i
always
try
to
pick
up
a
4
pack
when
i
head
down
to
jungle
jims
in
cincy
pours
hazy
medium
amber
with
very
minute
head
that
swirls
around
like
a
little
galaxy
in
your
goblet
if
youre
using
a
goblet
immediately
the
intense
smells
of
honey
and
spice
emanate
from
the
brew
very
nice
and
sweet
taste
did
not
match
the
smell
even
still
mainly
honey
and
grapes
are
maintained
in
the
taste
along
with
some
spice
i
assume
is
saffron
from
the
label
it
is
very
sweet
for
a
beer
seems
a
bit
meadish
to
me
which
i
greatly
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
creamy
and
consistent
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
i
could
barely
finish
one
let
alone
have
another
its
a
bit
too
intense
for
just
slugging
down
a
few
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
carbonation
helps
diffuse
the
syrupy
feel
increasing
the
beers
drinkability
this
beers
honey
syrup
notes
mimic
the
characteristics
of
a
barleywines
malt
character
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
that
drops
quickly
to
cover
the
beer
with
a
nice
ring
around
the
top
i
can
really
smell
the
honey
and
the
grape
in
the
nose
sweet
from
the
honey
and
spicy
from
the
grape
there
is
definately
more
of
a
honey
flavor
that
i
expected
from
the
nose
it
overpowers
the
grape
easily
leaving
me
wanting
a
bit
more
as
i
let
the
beer
warm
the
honey
falls
to
the
back
and
the
spicy
grape
comes
through
more
much
better
the
beer
is
nice
and
thick
in
my
mouth
but
the
honey
is
again
what
dominates
the
mouthfeel
im
just
not
that
crazy
about
this
much
honey
outside
of
a
mead
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
have
a
full
big
bottle
of
this
or
a
full
4
pack
im
glad
i
went
with
the
single
12ozer
i
think
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
once
but
much
more
than
that
is
probably
overkill
medium
bodied
weird
but
interesting
for
awhile
nice
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
ended
the
day
quite
pleased
with
my
find
this
was
i
will
admit
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
drink
750
ml
of
by
ones
self
but
no
one
ever
said
science
was
going
to
be
easy
clear
orange
with
a
substantial
cap
of
white
foam
head
fades
rapidly
and
leaves
just
a
touch
of
head
aroma
is
sickly
sweet
with
a
spicy
herbal
note
flavor
is
sweet
and
all
the
ingredients
make
an
appearance
mouthfeel
is
good
but
sadly
the
flavor
is
really
unbearable
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
because
the
concept
is
beyond
cool
sadly
it
seems
there
is
a
reason
the
recipe
was
lost
for
thousands
of
years
a
bit
too
sweet
considering
the
9
abv
i
just
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
thats
not
stopping
me
for
giving
dogfishhead
the
nod
for
such
a
creative
concoction
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
just
based
on
the
uniqueness
a
bit
hazy
melon
orange
and
rich
dark
gold
in
color
intense
spiciness
incredibly
aromatic
floral
honey
golden
raisins
wrong
dfh
beer
i
know
but
its
there
im
sure
of
it
and
pulverized
dilluted
plum
skin
lending
a
mouthwateringly
unripe
sort
of
fragrance
definitely
alcoholic
a
big
sweetness
honey
and
exotic
spices
i
suppose
that
characteristic
aroma
and
flavor
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
might
be
the
saffron
that
this
is
brewed
with
very
much
a
sensory
overload
sort
of
beer
sheer
experimentation
while
not
all
that
subtle
its
fascinating
stuff
beer
is
good
happy
strong
spicey
beering
definately
worth
trying
both
because
of
the
history
and
because
its
so
out
of
the
ordinary
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
750
ml
bottle
for
2
years
now
but
have
been
afraid
to
open
it
because
they
werent
making
it
anymore
so
i
was
ecstatic
to
these
in
a
4
pack
that
could
be
easily
sampled
with
no
guilt
i
have
to
say
this
is
some
intriguing
brew
this
pleasant
historical
recreation
pours
golden
and
forms
little
head
the
grape
and
grain
aroma
is
interesting
but
not
all
that
exciting
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavors
mingling
mead
and
wine
as
there
were
string
grassy
notes
grape
skin
and
dry
wine
flavors
all
brought
together
with
diacetyl
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
giving
the
beer
a
light
and
dry
mouth
feel
its
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
not
something
that
i
would
routinely
pour
for
my
self
i
would
break
it
out
at
dinner
parties
orangey
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
starts
out
low
and
quickly
drops
very
clear
with
thin
rows
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
up
aroma
is
light
consisting
of
hops
and
honey
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
little
tingle
toward
the
back
of
the
tongue
flavor
is
semisweet
with
notes
of
corn
and
honey
and
a
bit
of
butterscotch
some
white
wine
notes
in
the
finish
probably
from
the
muscat
grapes
but
not
too
overpowering
a
sweet
malt
flavor
lingers
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
but
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
even
so
theres
a
part
of
me
that
cant
help
thinking
that
this
tastes
a
little
like
budweiser
with
sugar
added
it
wasnt
a
bad
drink
just
not
what
i
expected
quite
refreshing
makes
a
great
dessert
not
very
good
in
my
book
an
interesting
brew
but
thank
god
for
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
sickening
and
urges
me
not
to
finish
this
bottle
but
i
must
i
must
for
the
love
of
the
beer
gods
i
would
only
ever
drink
this
with
another
beer
geek
big
does
not
equal
better
it
is
difficult
to
pigeon
hole
this
beer
in
a
specific
style
it
is
interesting
in
that
it
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
it
has
an
orange
gold
color
with
a
slight
haze
the
aroma
is
fruity
winey
perfumey
and
the
saffron
is
evident
the
body
is
coating
almost
syruppy
with
some
grape
and
malt
character
evident
it
finishes
with
a
slight
spice
not
bad
it
is
different
from
anything
that
i
have
ever
had
im
not
sure
there
are
many
occasions
to
drink
this
beermeadwine
but
it
is
something
that
im
glad
i
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
of
thick
malt
and
is
slightly
syrupy
slightly
dry
aftertaste
that
has
a
mild
citrus
bite
very
unique
brew
and
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
again

dogfishhead
continues
to

innovaters
and
risk
takers
try
their
beers
visit
their
locations
and
be
thankful
for
em
quite
an
interesting
attempt
at
resurrecting
a
bit
of
history
i
am
duly
impressed
by
any
brewery
that
is
willing
to
take
the
risk
to
brew
beers
like
this
on
a
regular
basis
how
often
do
you
get
to
drink
of
ancient
history
yes
it
is
cloyingly
sweet
but
theres
considerable
depth
in
its
flavor
elements
and
memorable
for
its
historical
context
the
dense
honey
sweetness
is
no
surprise
in
a
big
dfh
beer
nor
is
the
substantial
abv
but
they
do
limit
this
beer
somewhat
the
blend
of
flavors
make
it
palatable
but
that
alcohol
and
the
fact
it
sips
more
like
a
cordial
than
a
beer
seriously
truncate
how
much
youd
want
sure
it
is
a
curiosity
but
its
also
one
more
intriguing
experiment
from
the
first
states
gutsy
brewery
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
beer
is
a
unique
treat
and
the
historical
mystique
behind
it
if
a
bit
conjectural
makes
drinking
this
that
much
more
interesting
im
only
disappointed
that
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
my
buddies
and
i
saw
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
and
it
looked
very
apealing
to
us
it
came
in
a
4
pack
and
was
high
priced
at
10
99
but
we
decided
to
try
it
anyway
and
it
paid
off
this
stuff
has
to
be
the
smoothest
and
best
tasting
beer
ive
had
stouts
excluded
theyre
pretty
smooth
midas
touch
has
a
nice
honey
flavor
which
is
probably
why
it
is
at
9
i
had
this
beer
about
6
months
ago
and
seeing
it
on
this
site
again
i
am
going
to
get
another
4
pack
tonight
just
because
how
good
it
is
iv
noticed
that
dogfish
heads
beer
seem
to
be
kind
of
harsh
tasting
and
insaine
but
this
is
their
best
work
cheers
to
brewerowner
sam
calagione
this
is
a
beautiful
color
a
true
amber
with
a
wonderful
glow
the
head
isnt
as
impressive
an
off
white
on
the
small
size
but
a
thin
layer
lingers
and
it
laces
nicely
very
winey
aroma
a
bit
earthy
but
not
a
lot
else
the
flavor
is
really
nice
light
caramel
late
summer
grapes
especially
of
the
scuppernongmuscadine
variety
and
honey
light
sweetness
but
not
too
sweet
i
really
like
this
its
definitely
interesting
makes
me
think
of
late
summer
for
some
reason
ng
drinkability
a
very
interesting
brew
both
from
a
historical
and
flavor
standpoint
nothing
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
definately
good
to
have
around
a
surprisingly
good
beverage
12oz
bottle
this
one
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
to
it
there
was
absolutely
no
head
to
it
at
all
and
i
even
tried
halfway
through
the
pour
to
make
one
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
a
bit
spicy
possibly
floral
and
grape
notes
also
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
almost
a
little
syrupy
definite
grapes
and
honey
in
there
the
sweetness
lingers
a
bit
in
your
mouth
very
interesting
and
very
good
i
love
it
when
these
guys
push
the
envelope
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
some
white
particles
drifting
around
the
glass
medium
sized
head
on
top
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
on
the
surface
lots
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
surface
wonderfully
complex
aroma
malty
and
fruity
grapes
are
apparent
and
a
bit
of
apple
is
also
noticeable
i
can
detect
some
spice
on
the
nose
it
may
be
the
saffron
that
is
mentioned
on
the
label
but
i
never
would
have
know
if
it
wasnt
on
the
bottle
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
alcohol
are
also
in
the
aroma
palate
like
the
nose
seems
to
be
quite
complex
theres
a
smooth
sweet
slightly
malty
start
shortly
followed
by
fruity
flavors
some
sweetness
and
smoothness
is
also
added
by
the
honey
grapes
and
grape
skins
are
quite
noticeable
and
im
still
detecting
a
touch
of
apple
the
finish
is
sweet
yet
is
also
slightly
hoppy
and
fairly
tart
the
malt
comes
through
a
bit
more
again
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
as
this
brew
goes
down
full
mouth
feel
with
a
nice
carbonation
great
brew
that
is
pretty
complex
and
definitely
unique
im
finding
it
a
bit
tough
to
piece
together
all
the
flavors
in
this
review
it
would
probably
make
for
a
nice
desert
beer
and
is
certainly
a
nice
change
of
pace
cloudy
orange
colored
beer
pours
with
a
minmal
amount
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
very
earthy
and
reminds
me
of
wild
honeycomb
right
out
of
the
hive
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
strong
honey
notes
also
a
hint
of
grape
jelly
a
slight
graininess
and
earthy
overtone
are
evident
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
full
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
beer
seems
very
filling
this
is
a
unique
beer
one
bottle
was
enough
this
beer
has
a
looong
finish
an
great
mouthfeel
it
hangs
around
your
mouth
for
a
while
and
reminds
you
how
good
it
is
the
buttery
honey
taste
and
a
malty
backbone
keep
it
balanced
a
stupendous
effort
but
like
a
rich
dessert
i
wouldnt
consume
one
after
another
one
at
a
time
is
plenty
for
me
this
beer
poured
a
honeyorangereddish
color
i
assume
the
color
was
somewhat
influenced
by
the
use
of
saffron
it
was
fairly
clear
with
a
slight
chill
haze
to
it
decent
carbonation
the
head
that
was
produced
was
of
a
butter
creamtan
color
that
when
first
poured
rose
and
stayed
for
a
time
before
it
fell
to
a
ring
on
the
edges
its
body
was
cloud
like
fluffy
there
was
some
lace
present
the
aromas
were
different
then
i
expected
sweet
honey
and
grapes
dominated
the
aroma
with
hints
of
spices
allspice
saffron
light
herbs
and
alcohol
the
tastes
were
fairly
simple
flavors
of
honey
and
alcohol
hit
you
first
then
sweet
malts
followed
by
some
dark
fruit
and
apricot
and
sweet
grapes
then
as
it
left
my
mouth
hints
of
saffron
and
wine
were
left
the
aftertaste
was
fairly
faint
mostly
sweet
honey
and
wine
the
body
was
medium
once
warm
it
became
thicker
creamier
and
slightly
sweeter
in
the
mouth
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
would
drink
again
on
a
cool
night
enjoyable
served
cold
and
a
punch
as
it
warmed
which
i
enjoyed
better
to
let
it
warm
a
few
degrees
drinkability

plan
on
drinking
this
just
as
you
would
a
bottle
of
white
wine
and
youll
be
fine
pour
it
in
a
tulip
glass
dont
let
it
warm
and
drink
it
with
fish
or
chicken
or
something
light
this
is
all
over
the
place
when
you
go
through
it
for
me
it
is
rather
hard
to
really
narrow
down
for
a
review
while
i
would
not
have
this
all
the
time
it
is
def
worth
trying
and
enjoying
cheers
12
oz
bottle
with
freshness
date
on
label
reviewing
a
dfh
is
never
boring
and
this
one
is
no
exception
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
amber
no
head
worth
noting
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
label
says
it
contains
barley
honey
white
muscat
grapes
and
saffron
aroma
is
of
course
complex
and
confusing
honey
grapes
vague
spices
and
many
other
fruits
to
confound
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
somewhat
vinous
taste
is
fruity
sweetness
upfront
with
apples
apricots
and
grapes
sweet
caramel
and
honey
also
jump
into
the
deluge
spiciness
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
provide
the
balance
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
i
am
really
developing
a
fondness
and
appreciation
for
dfh
for
their
bold
endeavors
in
experimental
brews
and
pushing
the
envelope
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
very
good
for
this
truly
remarkable
beverage
not
an
everyday
beer
but
great
for
a
special
treat
midas
touch
is
very
different
and
a
touch
strange
but
i
like
it
its
a
lot
like
a
mead
with
the
important
distinction
that
i
can
actually
drink
this
midas
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
brew
used
similarly
to
a
sweet
fullbodied
dessert
wine
definitely
worth
a
try
though
im
sure
not
everyone
will
like
it
i
think
the
recipe
needs
some
work
poured
a
dark
honey
color
with
no
noticeable
head
plenty
of
effervescence
though
the
smell
is
flowery
cidery
and
it
makes
for
no
misgivings
about
its
potency
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
a
vertiable
explosion
on
the
pallate
very
complex
sweet
honey
herbal
notes
almost
a
trappistlike
dark
fruitiness
but
sweeter
exceptionally
tasty
mouthfeel
is
very
sweet
and
the
carbonation
level
is
very
very
fine
very
tasty
beverage
and
a
welcome
change
midas
touch
will
probably
not
please
the
hardcore
beer
traditionalist
a
group
to
which
i
do
not
belong
but
what
from
dfh
will
personally
i
love
this
stuff
you
should
drop
the
5
for
this
brew
just
to
experience
the
incredible
tastes
that
this
one
offers
this
does
not
even
make
it
as
a
novelty
beer
best
to
avoided
at
all
costs
drinkability

interesting

much
flavor
in
here
that
suggests
mead
or
white
wine
a
lot
of
sweetness
overall
it
was
enjoyable
and
a
good
crossover
beverage
for
wine
drinkers
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
habit
of
drinking
the
man
at
the
beer
store
was
correct
this
is
a
rather
interesting
brew
if
you
are
expecting
a
typical
malty
or
hoppy
beer
this
is
not
for
you
but
if
you
enjoy
trying
every
beer
you
can
get
your
hands
on
grab
one
of
these
just
try
one
though
it
is
very
possible
that
you
wont
like
this
one
barely
any
head
to
speak
of
good
taste
up
front
but
it
is
too
sweet
fruity
it
really
lowers
its
drinkability
but
then
again
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
and
i
would
recommend
getting
it
again
avoid
the
expensive
4pack
and
try
to
but
this
one
at
a
time
there
is
a
high
liklihood
you
wont
like
this
but
you
will
definitely
find
this
interesting
in
the
end
i
see
this
as
a
good
offering
from
this
brewery
i
dont
know
that
they
should
be
charging
10four
pack
for
it
but
its
good
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
single
midas
touch
is
wonderful
i
love
the
idea
that
they
got
the
recipe
from
king
midas
tomb
it
was
a
great
move
for
history
and
beer
the
color
is
great
being
a
dark
orange
or
redamber
color
and
i
just
have
to
smile
when
i
start
pouring
im
a
sucker
for
sweetness
and
this
is
sweet
the
taste
isnt
sickeningly
sweet
though
tasting
a
lot
like
spiced
wine
mixed
with
beer
strong
and
thick
it
makes
me
feel
nice
and
warm
inside
midas
touch
pours
with
a
deep
amberorange
color
with
small
head
that
dissipates
soon
after
being
poured
midas
is
extremely
sweet
with
prounced
tastes
of
grapes
and
honey
with
an
aftertaste
of
spiced
apples
very
similar
to
a
hard
cider
a
very
enjoyable
drink
especially
after
learning
the
fabled
origin
of
the
beer
congrats
to
dogfish
head
for
taking
the
chance
and
brewing
something
so
unique
the
feel
is
full
creamy
and
a
bit
syrupy
the
finish
is
a
bit
surprising
in
that
this
is
drier
than
i
expected
from
the
intial
tastes
not
a
beer
that
youd
drink
often
or
have
multiples
bottles
of
this
is
more
of
a
complement
to
special
meals
rather
like
wine
a
good
brew
for
occasions
i
respect
dogfish
head
for
making
this
beer
and
trying
something
completely
different
however
somewhere
from
king
midas
to
the
21st
century
something
much
have
been
lost
in
the
translation
pours
with
quick
fizzle
of
head
maybe
lasts
10
seconds
and
is
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
cloudy
haze
smells
of
fresh
grapes
and
alcohol
with
a
tad
bit
of
grain
coming
to
the
nose
tasted
initially
of
grape
juice
that
had
been
watered
down
a
slight
bit
of
malts
accompanied
by
floral
flavors
show
threw
in
a
somewhat
thin
mouthful
no
real
bitterness
comes
across
the
palate
but
it
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
interesting
to
say
the
least
and
is
quite
good
deep
orange
color
large
orange
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
grapeish
and
fairly
sweet
a
medium
bodied
ale
it
a
very
interesting
tasting
beer
malts
are
sweetish
no
hops
there
is
a
grapelike
and
ciderish
quality
to
this
beer
it
has
touches
of
orange
muscat
honey
and
spices
im
not
really
sure
i
would
call
this
a
beer
if
i
were
handed
some
in
a
blind
tasting
it
has
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
late
harvest
desert
wine
and
some
of
a
dry
cider
it
has
an
interesting
origin
and
i
will
always
try
this
kind
of
beer
i
applaud
brewers
who
are
not
afraid
to
try
different
things
and
this
is
one
thats
out
there
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
very
little
of
the
9
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
taste
light
and
refreshing
fruity
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
appleish
overall
its
a
very
interesting
beer
not
something
id
go
after
everyday
but
i
honestly
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
fruit
honey
safron
its
a
little
weird
but
imo
a
yummy
beer
bought
a
12
oz
single
before
i
could
read
the
previous
reviewers
final
warnings
oh
well
poured
a
fizzy
orangish
color
with
not
much
head
at
all
aroma
similar
to
a
barley
wine
a
sweet
candy
apple
alcohol
scent
along
with
a
grape
juice
aroma
and
a
hint
of
spice
i
noticed
surpisingly
little
taste
until
i
had
swallowed
maybe
just
a
little
grape
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
however
after
swallowing
it
was
a
very
soft
smooth
sweet
finish
with
the
grapes
again
being
the
dominant
flavor
although
i
do
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
that
this
was
like
a
soda
i
was
satisfied
with
the
way
it
tasted
it
was
just
very
subtle
in
its
ways
and
i
noticed
no
apparent
alcohol
besides
the
slight
touch
of
sweetness
if
it
werent
for
the
high
price
on
these
puny
little
4packs
i
would
buy
more
in
my
opinion
this
was
better
than
average
nb
avoid
the
12oz
bottles
in
particular
although
marginally
sweeter
they
are
much
harsher
and
overtly
alcoholic
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
honey
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
quickly
there
is
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
ginger
honey
and
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
also
malty
and
sweet
with
honey
saffron
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
strong
the
drinkability
is
fairly
nice
for
a
9
brew
very
unique
and
very
good
this
one
poured
hazy
into
the
glass
with
almost
no
head
bad
almost
sickening
aroma
an
almost
grotesque
taste
was
accompanied
by
an
even
worse
aftertaste
i
had
this
one
at
a
tasting
with
my
friends
i
wasnt
the
only
unhappy
customer
it
almost
killed
the
whole
night
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
gold
color
with
almost
no
head
this
did
not
impress
me
at
all
the
aroma
was
horrible
it
smelt
cidery
the
taste
was
also
bad
it
tasted
syrupy
there
seems
to
be
little
complexity
it
boasts
a
9abv
the
mouthfeel
was
lacking
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
no
very
drinkable
definitely
a
good
beer
to
start
the
holiday
weekend
with
a
small
sized
creamy
ivory
head
that
consisted
of
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
body
was
cloudy
and
uncarbonated
the
hue
was
a
dull
orange
and
the
lacing
was
fair
the
nose
was
that
of
grape
and
some
fruit
along
with
a
bitter
tart
alcohol
and
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
tingly
and
medium
bodied
pours
to
a
copperorange
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
super
strong
of
sweet
raisins
and
grapes
it
also
has
an
aroma
that
i
cant
figure
out
possibly
the
saffron
the
flavor
has
the
sweetness
of
the
raisins
and
grapes
up
front
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
smoothly
sweet
it
is
light
compared
to
its
strength
it
is
almost
winelike
in
its
sweetness
avery
tasty
complex
brew
another
good
beer
by
dogfish
head
smelled
of
grapes
cumin
though
its
really
saffron
hard
to
detect
much
else
because
of
these
taste
was
sweetly
of
white
grapes
lightly
syrupy
from
the
honey
but
dissappeared
then
a
strange
herby
spice
flavor
from
the
saffron
came
on
not
much
else
couldnt
detect
alcohol
at
all
with
a
softly
dry
finish
nice
easy
mouthfeel
its
different
but
not
compelling
other
comments
not
certain
what
temperature
to
serve
this
at
muscat
wines
are
generally
served
bone
cold
beer
and
mead
less
so
id
recommend
chilling
it
to
almost
freezing
and
see
how
the
taste
develops
as
it
warms
for
kicks
another
interesting
and
genre
bendingbreaking
brew
from
dogfish
head
from
one
of
the
nowrare
750
ml
clear
bottles
this
pours
a
glowing
apricot
hue
with
a
fairly
frothy
white
head
which
retains
much
better
than
expected
leaves
patches
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
mild
sweetness
fruit
notably
the
muscat
grapes
honey
and
alcohol
very
interesting
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
gets
most
interesting
as
its
possible
to
detect
every
ingredient
listed
on
the
label
the
main
flavor
here
is
upfront
sweet
honey
followed
by
notes
of
graininess
winelike
muscat
grapes
mild
saffron
and
an
alcoholic
finish
sweetness
dominates
however
mellow
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
smooth
syrupy
mouthfeel
overall
not
an
overly
drinkable
brew
but
one
ill
sample
again
seemingly
only
dogfish
head
makes
beverages
like
this
a
classy
effort
wow
this
is
something
differentpours
a
nice
hazy
copperorange
color
with
real
nice
sticky
head
that
stays
for
quite
awhilea
pretty
sweet
aroma
of
honey
with
a
slightly
tart
tinge
to
it
taste
is
pretty
sweet
to
begin
with
a
litle
spiciness
lingers
a
pretty
complex
beervery
well
made
dogfish
head
likes
to
try
different
things
and
for
the
most
part
are
sucessfull
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
upon
sipping
this
and
i
must
say
now
that
i
have
that
it
is
indeed
unique
slightly
sweet
fruity
malty
and
has
a
woody
character
and
dogfish
head
makes
no
effort
to
hide
the
alcohol
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
you
know
the
alcohol
at
9
is
there
this
would
pair
well
with
a
meal
as
wine
does
well
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
try
it
that
way
this
is
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
much
of
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
certainly
is
unique
my
numbers
for
this
beer
are
not
that
high
but
beer
lovers
should
give
this
one
a
try
it
rates
high
on
the
uniqueness
scale
great
great
stuff
and
the
9
really
hits
your
head
so
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
amazing
creation
and
just
another
reason
that
dfh
gets
my
vote
as
the
most
revolutionary
american
brewery
that
i
have
experienced
appears
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
an
orangish
peach
tint
to
the
mammoth
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
trickled
lacing
aroma
contains
slightly
musty
grape
notes
with
a
big
aroma
of
alcohol
to
the
nose
along
with
a
sharp
pleasant
honey
richness
to
it
taste
has
a
wine
like
finish
very
sweet
rush
with
slight
hints
of
spice
and
honey
very
good
but
doesnt
tie
it
all
together
for
me
i
may
just
not
be
into
mead
mouthfeel
has
high
carbonation
with
that
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
its
all
contained
in
this
light
to
medium
bodied
slight
syrupy
rich
consistency
drinkability
is
desireable
especially
seems
it
would
pair
well
with
some
good
mediterranean
style
food
but
the
9
abv
doesnt
allow
this
beer
to
be
one
for
session
drinking
originally
sampled
on
29
september
2002
honey
colored
w
a
lemon
chiffon
colored
head
has
an
aroma
of
a
chardonnay
w
a
slightly
sweet
taste
its
alcohol
isnt
hidden
at
all
its
very
different
i
actually
liked
it
big
thx
to
armed
for
supplying
it
not
something
id
have
every
day
but
something
different
for
a
special
occasion
definitely
a
conversation
piece
and
the
9
abv
will
loosen
some
tongues
as
well
pours
a
clear
sparkling
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
fades
into
a
good
amount
of
lace
at
first
that
eventually
completely
vanishes
nose
is
sweet
honey
barley
saffron
and
a
bit
of
perfume
fairly
full
in
body
with
a
texture
similar
to
a
buttery
chardonnay
taste
is
very
complex
with
flavors
of
raw
honey
sweet
grapes
and
saffron
followed
by
some
tart
acidic
notes
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
overall
the
9
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
drinks
i
have
had
and
it
certainly
has
a
remarkable
story
behind
its
creation
a
marvelous
brew
and
truly
a
golden
elixir

purchased
from
vintage
cellar
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
some
slight
carbonation
and
a
small
head
that
turns
into
white
lacing
around
the
rim
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
alcoholic
rather
inviting
with
a
plum
scent
very
warm
going
down
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
here
not
a
great
taste
but
lots
of
taste
honey
pears
apples
and
plums
detected
with
alcohol
vapors
filling
the
sinuses
quite
syrupy
but
there
is
enough
carbonation
to
make
for
a
decent
mouthfeel
considering
i
was
expecting
a
novelty
beer
this
is
fairly
drinkable
while
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
i
love
the
adventurous
spirit
beers
like
this
should
come
around
more
often
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
ever
experienced
the
story
is
worth
trying
the
beer
for
alone
read
the
story
behind
it
if
youre
not
familiar
with
it
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
color
and
doesnt
create
much
head
no
matter
how
its
poured
there
is
no
lacing
from
this
beer
the
aroma
is
very
odd
containing
scents
of
honey
alcohol
and
some
spices
the
beer
is
very
thick
much
more
thick
than
a
wine
or
something
but
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
pouring
characteristics
i
want
to
classify
the
taste
as
a
mix
between
good
beer
and
good
champagne
that
becomes
a
fairly
good
tasting
result
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
pints
of
this
at
a
time
but
the
story
of
the
beer
makes
the
taste
even
more
interesting
than
it
would
normally
be
my
hat
is
off
to
dogfish
head
for
coming
up
with
this
one
it
is
indeed
one
of
a
kind
update
this
stuff
definately
loses
character
in
12oz
bottles
the
aromas
are
subdued
and
the
taste
is
definately
less
fresh
stick
with
the
750s
for
this
one
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
the
spices
and
bitterness
are
kept
in
the
distant
backround
as
sweet
malts
and
honey
are
the
major
contributers
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
gets
fruity
and
very
sweet
like
maracino
cherries
sp
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
but
you
can
pick
it
up
just
a
little
bit
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
is
good
for
any
season
thanks
again
to
miller
my
fellow
sampler
for
this
one
acquired
via
trade
pours
a
foggy
orange
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
very
little
lacing
very
sweet
aroma
of
grapes
honey
and
peach
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
sweet
and
there
are
really
no
hops
to
speak
of
tastes
of
honey
herbs
and
spices
finish
is
rather
dry
definitely
unique
ok
the
bottle
was
cool
with
the
little
story
and
all
so
i
admit
it
this
hooked
me
on
buying
it
really
it
looked
pretty
similar
to
bud
light
but
maybe
a
shade
darker
i
got
no
head
what
so
ever
either
i
figured
if
it
was
good
enough
for
midas
then
it
was
good
enough
for
me
it
actually
tasted
like
a
light
mead
but
with
a
little
more
fruit
in
it
had
a
smooth
finish
but
had
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
to
it
but
not
too
bad
interesting
is
all
i
can
really
say
to
bring
back
a
beer
that
has
beed
dead
for
thousands
of
years
wow
served
to
me
honey
colored
with
no
head
whatsoever
tastes
of
honey
and
thats
gotta
be
saffron
i
bought
a
cup
because
i
knew
that
there
would
be
never
another
chance
for
me
to
try
this
on
tap
and
for
so
cheap
as
the
bottles
run
up
to
15
im
glad
i
had
this
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
im
glad
that
there
are
brewerys
like
dogfish
out
there
that
will
take
a
risk
like
this
with
a
beer
this
is
only
available
in
750
ml
bottles
it
pours
a
clear
gently
sparkling
deep
orangeish
amber
body
with
a
creamy
yellowish
head
that
drops
shortly
but
keeps
a
decent
collar
and
leaves
some
minor
spotty
lace
sweet
and
almost
candyish
grapes
like
concord
grapes
sweep
across
the
nostrils
accompanied
by
a
distinct
honeyish
character
its
very
meadlike
with
some
alcohol
and
a
slightly
herbal
note
the
aroma
is
interesting
not
really
welcoming
but
not
offputting
either
the
full
body
is
enhanced
by
a
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
that
caresses
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
most
reminiscent
of
a
mead
but
also
like
a
fortified
wine
and
it
even
has
some
sherryish
notes
theres
not
much
beer
character
to
it
but
i
think
the
malt
component
helps
to
add
to
the
body
and
also
softens
the
alcohol
component
definitely
interesting
althought
i
view
it
as
more
of
a
wine
or
mead
than
beer
the
high
alcohol
helps
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
becoming
cloying
but
it
had
its
drawbacks
most
importantly
a
lacquerlike
quality
still
fairly
well
done
for
what
it
is
the
whole
premise
behind
this
drink
a
combination
of
a
mead
wine
beer
is
really
innovative
poured
a
golden
tan
in
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
consisted
of
honey
grapes
and
saffron
mouthfeel
was
smooth
taste
had
hints
of
fermented
honey
grapes
and
alcohol
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
at
all
and
flavors
seem
to
balance
well
within
this
complex
elixir
congratulations
again
to
dogfish
head
for
pushing
the
envelope
and
coming
up
with
something
truly
unique
well
a
look
back
in
time
to
ancient
brews
and
brewing
methods
when
served
cold
it
had
a
very
distinctive
nearly
caramel
quality
that
reminded
me
strongly
of
victorys
ol
horizontal
barleywine
ale
while
not
altogether
bad
it
wasnt
altogether
good
either
letting
it
set
awhile
so
it
could
come
close
to
room
temperature
was
the
midas
touch
it
needed
to
really
shine
the
caramel
receded
to
be
replaced
by
a
more
balanced
ale
flavor
vaguely
reminiscent
as
has
been
already
noted
like
mead
while
i
liked
it
well
enough
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
tasting
beer
than
a
drinking
beer
for
me
as
always
your
mileage
may
vary
kudos
for
dogfish
head
for
being
so
experimental
in
bringing
this
brew
to
market
great
stuff
and
reminds
me
of
the
best
belgians
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
honey
grapes
and
spices
a
flavor
of
honey
and
grape
buttery
finish
not
bad
for
an
experimental
beer
opaque
and
thick
yellow
tan
color
head
settles
at
14
of
an
inch
after
some
early
action
grapey
nose
like
a
grape
soda
with
a
cheesy
up
smell
thick
mouthfeel
sense
of
grapes
honey
thickness
as
a
mellowing
agent
and
some
molasses
flavors
little
balance
saffron
gives
it
a
weird
color
since
everything
but
the
kitchen
sink
is
thrown
in
this
brew
maybe
this
does
approximate
ancient
recipes
with
its
thick
meadelike
sweetness
ok
i
suppose
ill
pick
up
another
bomber
the
next
time
i
get
an
invite
to
a
pagan
ritual
kind
of
insipid
this
is
a
very
experimental
brew
very
similar
to
mead
but
much
better
i
have
never
been
a
big
mead
fan
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
so
is
this
very
candy
like
tastand
very
similar
to
a
heavier
dessert
white
wine
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
orange
in
color
with
little
head
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
you
can
definitely
taste
the
muscat
grapes
they
use
in
here
and
not
much
else
for
what
it
is
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
a
beverage
the
only
reason
i
would
dock
it
points
is
if
i
knew
there
were
going
after
a
certain
style
and
did
not
follow
specs
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
enjoy
dessert
wines
pours
with
a
yellow
head
golden
orange
in
color
with
little
bubbles
smells
of
honey
and
grapes
sweet
grape
honey
taste
totally
different
than
anything
that
you
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
they
drank
this
2700
years
age
at
a
grand
funerary
feast
and
it
is
as
unique
as
the
history
it
represents
not
an
everyday
beer
mead
but
a
nice
trip
back
in
history
a
nice
goldenorange
clored
brew
with
plenty
of
apparent
carbonation
it
has
a
thick
rocky
white
head
solid
head
retention
with
residual
lace
almost
completely
coating
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
like
a
mild
mead
grape
comes
through
somewhat
in
the
taste
smell
mixing
with
a
slightly
yeasty
aroma
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
bit
too
meadwinelike
to
become
a
regular
but
a
good
brew
for
a
change
of
pace
this
one
was
a
bit
much
by
itself
but
would
be
superior
escorting
some
grub
i
dig
it

sight

cooler
like

unique
but
not
beerlike
some
honey
sweetness
and
smoothness
emerges
everything
the
bottle
lists
is
here
but
not
a
true
beer
good
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
beer
but
its
decent
very
easy
drinking
for
the
alcohol
load
all
these
badasses
do
is
make
high
alcohol
beers
dont
they
id
hate
to
party
with
these
fers
this
beer
is
golden
with
orange
highlights
nice

nice

sweet

honey
smells
like
a
braggot
this
beer
tastes
fairly
bland
to
me
there
are
some
sweet
honey
tones
the
impressive
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
9
av
if
you
want
an
easy
drinking
high
av
beer
this
is
it
dangerously
smooth
and
easy
drinking
personally
there
is
not
enough
complexity
in
the
taste
for
me
to
sample
this
one
very
often
especially
given
the
price
this
beer
was
to
say
the
leastinteresting
nice
gold
amber
in
color
sight
head
with
fine
champagne
bubbles
light
nose
of
tart
grapes
the
first
taste
is
a
little
tart
then
comes
the
honey
and
barleyyou
cant
go
into
this
beer
with
the
thought
that
it
is
like
any
beer
you
have
ever
tasted
great
beerwinemead
to
be
sipping
on
in
the
summer
this
brew
was
a
bit
different
than
i
expected
i
was
looking
for
a
strong
malty
brew
with
a
harsh
alcohol
character
and
a
finish
to
take
paint
off
the
family
vehicle
what
i
found
was
a
hazy
golden
pouring
with
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
with
a
complex
aroma
of
musky
grapes
and
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
first
taste
uncovered
a
complex
heavy
grape
and
honey
sweetness
with
a
musky
oaky
finish
this
concoction
was
very
smooth
for
teh
alcohol
content
and
is
reminiscent
of
a
fine
aged
wine
nice
work
luminous
hazy
orange
bright
white
head
citrusy
aroma
slightly
winey
like
chardonnay
alcohol
perceived
in
nose
nice
effervescent
flavor
tight
carbonation
could
serve
as
a
great
replacement
for
champagne
slight
belgian
yeast
flavor
creamy
and
smooth
throughout
very
dry
wheaty
finish
unique
gotta
admire
dogfish
head
for
taking
a
shot
at
reproducing
an
ancient
grapebarleyhoney
ale
not
like
anything
ive
run
across
before
the
aroma
is
that
of
wine
or
a
wine
flavored
malt
beverage
like
cold
duck
first
sip
was
sweet
and
very
winelike
only
at
the
end
did
any
hint
of
malt
slip
in
i
was
not
terribly
taken
with
this
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
the
malt
became
more
noticeable
but
the
grapes
never
gave
much
ground
at
about
room
temperature
it
seemed
like
some
strange
hybred
between
a
belgian
dubble
and
a
barleywine
an
interesting
experiment
but
im
ready
to
move
on
notes
great
to
have
an
experimental
brew
here
and
there
bring
this
to
a
dinner
party
to
funk
things
up
after
a
couple
of
bottle
of
this
they
wont
know
up
from
down
or
wine
from
beer
other
than
that
it
is
not
a
beer
that
would
be
considered
an
everyday
beer
nor
a
beer
you
can
drink
much
at
all
more
or
less
a
beer
to
share
with
a
meal
seems
to
pair
well
with
garlic
studded
pork
loin
with
brown
rice
that
could
be
cooked
with
saffron
and
a
sundried
tomato
spinach
and
goat
cheese
salad
i
must
admit
from
what
ive
read
and
the
description
on
the
label
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
brew
it
was
really
more
beer
like
than
i
anticipated
slightly
hazy
peach
colored
liquid
nice
pillowy
lasting
tan
head
grapes
honey
are
evident
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
definitely
sweet
but
not
cloying
considering
all
the
unique
components
in
this
brew
the
flavors
blend
pretty
well
overall
a
unique
worthwhile
treat
i
would
love
to
give
king
midas
some
immort
ale
just
to
let
him
witness
how
far
beer
has
progressed
the
in
past
few
millennia
the
first
sip
that
i
took
of
this
beer
i
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
too
sweet
for
me
despite
the
amazing
complexity
of
mixing
mead
wine
and
beer
not
too
often
you
get
to
try
a
beer
that
has
been
reported
on
by
the
new
york
times
as
a
matter
of
archeological
interest
the
muscat
grapes
do
add
a
tartness
that
was
not
here
the
first
time
that
i
tried
this
beer
i
think
it
detracts
from
the
drinkability
not
as
much
of
a
fan
anymore
but
still
a
great
unique
brew
o
read
patrick
mcgoverns
book
that
discusses
how
this
was
made
and
it
is
an
inceredible
story
a
person
who
like
sweet
wines
will
probably
like
this
one
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
rather
sweet
with
the
honey
coming
through
the
nose
the
taste
was
nice
with
first
the
sweet
honey
and
fruit
notes
and
then
the
grapes
coming
through
on
the
finish
for
a
tart
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
wasnt
as
clean
as
i
would
have
liked
but
very
good
and
an
interesting
beer
i
would
try
again
poured
into
a
snifter
from
the
jiahu
bomber
a
very
cloudy
amber
beer
with
a
head
that
dissolves
quickly
nose
is
sweet
white
grape
taste
is
dominated
by
honey
and
muscat
grape
but
not
cloying
very
well
balanced
interesting
that
the
main
flavors
are
sweet
yet
it
remains
highly
drinkable
with
no
counterbalancing
hopbitterness
profile
though
there
is
a
spicy
underpinning
perhaps
from
the
10
abv
aftertaste
again
is
a
slightly
dry
warm
white
grape
much
like
dfh
red
white
or
poured
3
finger
head
great
flavor
crisp
altough
the
alcohol
is
very
subtle

aroma
is

and
something
akin

and
sweet
fruit
and
there
is
a
hint
of
floral
hops
and
oh
yeah
honey
i
find
that
the
honey
aspect
is
dominant
in
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
the
sweetness
itself
being
the
dominant
aspect
of
the
beer
there
are
touches
of
other
fruit
mostly
grape
and
a
floral
edge
that
i
know
of
thanks
to
the
label
finally
tried
this
after
years
of
passing
and
glad
i
did
bc
i
like
sweet
beers
and
this
a
lighter
drinking
sweet
beer
that
is
not
too
sweet
o
if
you
like
honey
you
will
love
this
beer
i
like
honey
and
this
is
my
favorite
beer
right
now
sweet
sweet
god
nectar
its
good
to
know
that
i
could
take
the
delorean
back
9000
years
and
still
enjoy
magnificent
beer
beerandwhiskeyhq
o
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
definitely
aged
well
o
3
75
enjoyable
but
due
to
the
level
of
sugar
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
pint
at
a
time
overall
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
but
not
one
id
return
to
would
definitely
be
curious
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
though
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
combined
with
the
relatively
high
alcohol
and
tartness
o
interesting
surprisingly
good
for
a
reproduction
of
an
ancient
fermented
beverage
though
i
would
open
another
when
im
more
in
the
mood
for
a
desert
wine
than
a
beer
o
overall
i
really
dig
this
beer
not
sure
its
something
id
made
a
habit
of
drinking
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
in
the
future
if
i
were
looking
for
a
unique
change
of
pace
i
could
see
this
being
a
love
it
or
hate
it
sort
of
thing
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
orange
with
almost
no
head
it
looks
nice
but
is
also
different
quite
unique
in
character
scents
of
sweet
fruit
sweet
sake
and
aromatic
flowers
its
an
almost
perfume
like
nose
extremely
appealing
easily
the
finest
part
of
the
beer
flavors
were
very
sweet
sweet
fruit
sweet
moscato
wine
a
hint
of
sweet
sake
and
a
slight
hint
of
honey
on
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
extremely
sweet
and
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
a
moscato
sangria
or
something
of
that
nature
at
10
abv
the
alcohol
was
not
noticeable
at
all
not
horrible
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
hiding
the
alcohol
quite
well
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
because
of
this
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
quite
sweet
and
in
many
ways
has
more
in
common
with
a
moscato
wine
than
a
beer
in
its
flavor
profile
however
it
does
have
an
appeal
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
i
poured
it
from
a
22
oz
bottle
it
has
a
light
yellow
color
body
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissapers
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grapey
the
taste
is
sweet
of
honey
some
grape
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
wine
liked
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
couldnt
drink
it
everyday
but
once
and
a
while
would
be
good
overall
its
a
very
sweet
beer
and
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
mead
and
history
this
one
is
a
good
one
to
pick
up
we
had
it
a
lot
more
fresh
in
a
sample
at
the
dfh
brewery
and
a
glass
at
the
brewpub
its
definitely
a
lot
better
fresh
than
in
a
bottle
o
interesting
brew
again
from
dfh
lots
of
herbs
and
spices
mixed
with
sweet
honey
and
zesty
grapes
makes
for
pretty
good
ancient
ale
cheers
o
a
fruity
and
slightly
spice
sort
of
a
braggot
with
a
good
amount
of
honey
character
for
me
this
was
just
overly
sweet
and
the
booze
didnt
help
it
either
theres
just
tons
of
honey
that
just
sites
on
the
tongue
which
could
use
some
more
spice
to
clean
it
up
overall
now
this
is
one
fascinating
brew
the
9000
year
old
story
told
on
the
bottle
does
not
disappoint
this
is
one
exotic
tasting
brew
not
quite
like
anything
ive
had
before
i
am
reminded
of
other
beers
brewed
with
grapes
that
i
have
had
before
and
yet
the
other
ingredients
set
this
one
far
apart
from
the
crowd
the
flavor
is
just
that
much
more
complex
and
beguiling
given
the
relative
lack
of
aroma
its
damned
delicious
though
not
a
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
the
alcohol
definitely
sneaks
up
on
you
i
am
absolutely
loving
this
beer
if
you
want
to
take
the
risk
of
indeed
calling
it
a
beer
a
really
interesting
combination
of
flavors
and
one
of
dfhs
ancient
ale
recipes
that
actually
works
by
the
way
did
i
mention
the
grapes
loved
the
idea
but
was
not
expecting
the
sweetness
to
blur
my
mind
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
overall
i
think
i
would
like
this
one
if
it
was
just
not
so
sweet
this
was
an
intensely
alcoholic
but
thin
beer
but
very
well
done
except
for
the
sweetness
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
i
am
well
known
for
being
in
favour
of
sweet
beers
but
this
was
just
over
the
top
amazing
fruity
notes
though
all
over
the
spectrum
it
had
a
very
lagery
tone
to
it
too
very
intense
but
very
light
in
feel
i
know
they
used
sake
yeast
but
i
wonder
what
temperature
it
was
fermented
at
and
for
how
long
because
it
was
definitely
far
more
like
a
really
great
lager
than
like
an
ale
thanks
dogfish
head
for
another
great
beer
but
if
you
could
lay
off
the
sugary
sweetness
that
would
be
great
i
love
this
series
and
i
was
stoked
to
see
this
on
tap
at
the
new
renegade
tap
house
on
university
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
tinted
thicker
color
with
a
colossal
three
inch
white
fizzy
head
on
top
with
fine
retention
the
nose
is
very
unique
and
i
think
i
smell
sake
yeast
although
im
not
a
big
sake
guy
generally
lots
of
interesting
fruits
as
well
and
a
grain
blend
only
dogfish
head
could
come
up
with
the
first
sip
i
notice
the
feel
more
than
the
flavor
its
denser
than
it
looks
not
very
carbonated
despite
the
head
and
has
a
bit
of
honey
type
sugars
on
the
back
end
a
funny
feel
that
i
dont
totally
love
the
flavor
i
do
love
though
floral
and
sweet
bright
and
decidedly
eastern
in
vibe
there
are
ingredients
here
that
i
am
entirely
unfamiliar
with
but
much
like
etrusca
midas
touch
and
some
of
the
others
i
like
the
way
it
all
comes
together
in
an
approachable
but
challenging
way
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
especially
now
that
i
have
learned
this
is
10
abv
a
strength
one
would
never
detect
from
drinking
this
beer
i
hope
these
archeological
brews
continue
they
are
always
a
lot
of
fun
to
sit
down
with
overall
a
little
too
meady
taste
and
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
not
horrible
but
nothing
too
great
for
the
price
low
b
this
was
actually
pretty
good
sweet
with
the
honey
a
good
desert
beer
the
abv
is
non
existent
in
the
taste
i
really
enjoy
these
historic
and
cultural
beer
recreations
this
beer
is
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
hazy
complexion
the
smell
is
flowery
gardenlike
with
honey
and
plenty
of
fruit
peach
and
berries
the
beer
is
extremely
sweet
sugary
honey
fruit
juicea
nod
a
spice
that
lingers
full
in
body
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
interesting
engaging
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
worth
trying
for
the
historystory
behind
it
but
given
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
fruit
and
slight
herbal
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
back
story
but
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
do
enjoy
the
initial
flavor
quite
a
bit
a
lot
more
than
i
do
the
syrupy
mouth
feel
and
subsquent
flavor
that
lingers
in
my
mouth
though
but
that
definitely
isnt
stopping
me
from
finishing
the
bottle
o
well
this
beer
follows
the
others
in
dfhs
ancient
ales
series
it
tends
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
current
tastes
but
i
wouldve
loved
it
2
years
ago
when
i
seemed
more
taken
by
the
novelty
of
the
line
i
had
this
served
through
randal
the
enamel
animal
with
sake
and
some
sort
of
fruit
at
the
dogfish
head
brewpub
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
fruity
overtones
were
a
bit
much
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
dessert
beer
it
tends
to
overpower
everything
else
o
we
all
thought
this
would
make
a
great
dessert
wine
unique
in
a
good
way
from
dfh
single
finger
head
with
excellent
thick
lacing
on
a
golden
amber
murky
body
aroma
of
orange
juice
candied
fruits
honey
and
caramel
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
dogfish
head
brews
the
initial
taste
is
strong
complex
a
few
more
sips
one
can
pick
out
orange
blossom
honey
candied
fruits
up
front
finishing
very
sweet
and
floral
oily
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
pretty
boozy
and
too
sweet
for
me
complex
and
worth
trying
i
would
share
the
bottle
with
a
friend
or
three
repeated
pourings
created
little
to
no
head
so
lets
call
it
a
wash
nose
was
both
fruity
and
flowery
definitely
grape
but
with
springlike
flowers
think
daisies
clover
et
al
wow
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
rather
flat
with
a
very
meadlike
taste
a
tip
o
the
wood
to
my
old
lady
for
her
expertise
in
this
area
lots
of
honey
flavor
on
the
tongue
accompanied
by
whichever
flowers
from
which
it
was
derived
finish
was
breathtakingly
dry
as
you
might
expect
from
a
honeybased
beer
nice
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax

vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
hazy
copper
body
off
white
head
low
retention
clear
minimal
lacing
aroma
includes
caramel
malts
orange
marmalade
grape
juice
and
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
taste
really
dominated
by
grapes
sweet
grapes
amazing
how
all
traces
of
alcohol
have
disappeared
and
now
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
at
a
very
high
abv
paired
quite
well
with
a
spicy
shrimp
risotto
atmosphere
is
good
decent
body
but
nothing
much
to
speak
of
in
terms
of
lacing
nose
is
a
very
interesting
combination
of
components
sweet
and
fruit
plant
and
dairy
flavor
is
syrupy
and
honey
sweet
with
some
solid
fruit
compliments
this
should
probably
come
in
a
smaller
vessel
due
to
its
cloying
characteristics
overall
this
is
a
good
but
interesting
quaff
sam
and
dr
mcgovern
have
indeed
done
it
again
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
almost
winelike
beverage
i
definitely
can
taste
the
flavors
from
the
sake
yeast
they
used
which
creates
a
definite
roundness
in
the
overall
feel
and
flavor

this

nice
experimental
ancient
ale
from
dogfish
head
tons
of
flavor
complexity
and
balance
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
a
9
beer
there
are
also
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
i
cannot
describe
but
they
work
well
very
impressive
as
a
sipping
beer
this
was
pretty
good
like
when
i
was
just
watching
tv
and
not
really
focusing
on
it
it
was
fine
but
when
i
really
got
to
trying
to
appreciate
this
one
it
wasnt
that
great
depends
on
what
youre
looking
for
but
i
think
there
are
beers
that
are
similar
but
better
than
this
one
the
nose
is
very
flowery
and
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
slight
hints
of
fruitiness
like
grapes
and
oranges
honey
sweetness
up
front
dominates
then
a
winelike
fruitiness
washes
over
the
tongue
and
blends
with
a
flowery
brightness
at
the
tail
end
the
sticky
honey
flavors
take
back
over
and
sticks
around
on
the
tongue
leaving
you
with
a
lingering
sweetness
but
a
dry
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
ancient
ales
in
my
opinion
o
a
good
sipping
beer
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
o
just
kinda
there
not
worth
the
12
bucks
i
paid
all
these
dogfish
ancient
ales
have
the
same
base
flavor
and
that
irritates
the
hell

me

pours
clear
orange
amber
slight

nice
aroma
of
fruit
pear
and
apple
among

and

simple

tasty
blend

and
light

flavors
moderate

honey
flavors
are
reminiscent
of
midas
touch
a
bit
sweet
but
very
pleasant
to
drink
im
rating
this
comparatively
low
because
it
tastes
like
a
grossly
overpriced
mead
it
is
good
if
you
can
stand
the
sweetness
but
you
can
make
something
equally
as
tasty
for
far
less
money
at
home
it
doesnt
get
easier
than
mead
and
i
think
dogfish
head
is
really
pushing
it
to
sell
a
bomber
of
this
for
12
there
are
some
distinctions
in
the
taste
because
of
the
ingredients
they
used
but
overall
the
taste
is
simply
too
reminiscent
of
good
ol
mead
i
wont
buy
this
again
pleasant
for
a
couple
sips
but
the
sweetness
overpowers
everything
here
originally

really
nice
and
complex
and
nuanced
good
mix
of
unique
flavors
that
really
come
together
nicely
overall
an
interesting
brew
good
mouthfeel
and
appearance
reminded
me
of
a
popular
german

this
brew
is
not
overpowering
in
flavor
but
not
terribly
complex
for
all
its
unique
ingredients
its
also
a
bit
boozy
worth
trying
you
dont
taste
much
of
it
at
all
it
takes
on
a
white
wine
quality
somewhere
in
there
but
the
layers
of
complexity
outshine
most
wines
the
sweetness
is
counterbalanced
by
a
small
hop
bitterness

a
very
interesting
brew
which
isnt
a
surprise
from
dogfish
head
sweet
mo
very
nice
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
thick
because
of
the
sugars
but
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
750
ml
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
and
much
carbonation
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
honey
and
some
bready
notes
full
creamy
smooth
body
honey
ripe
fruit
sweet
malt
and
some
light
hops
fill
the
mouth
sweet
unusual
but
enjoyable
dfh
like
brew
o
awesome
beer
so
much
flavor
and
really
unique
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
complex
white
wines
i
liked
it
the
when
it
was
a
little
bit
warmer
not
room
temp
but
slightly
elevated
temp
alot
of
the
layered
flavors
started
to
come
through
at
that
point
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
would
drink
it
whenever
i
could
pours
a
vibrant
strawgold
color
that
is
mostly
translucent
but
not
entirely
a
white
frothy
head
settles
to
gives
patches
of
wet
lacing
smells
of
grape
honey
clove
straw
and
various
earthy
grains
it
tastes
very
similar
consisting
of
grape
lots
of
honey
orange
clove
and
a
smattering
of
earthen
notes
mouth
is
smooth
rich
and
possesses
an
intriguing
caramellike
texture
overall
a
great
beer
all
around
o
an
original
brew
complex
and
balanced
profile
a
good
example
of
dfhs
motto
would
have
to
say
that
with
all
the
ingredients
use
its
really
hard
to
distinguish
all
those
different
qualities
as
the
beer
just
seems
to
come
out
rather
sweet
and
strong
pour
is
like
a
lighter
colored
barley
wine
a
finger
of
head
nose
of
grapeskins
and
honey
the
sort
of
malty
bit
o
honey
candy
you
get
with
some
beligian
the
rice
is
pretty
much
a
silky
feel
to
the
addition
to
the
beer
the
yeast
is
something
of
a
sake
finish
to
it
but
all
the
wonderful
details
like
the
chrysanthemum
is
lost
the
hawthorn
berries
have
a
similar
note
of
sourness
as
the
grape
big
beer
with
a
lot
to
offer
to
boldly
sweet
too
strong
that
the
malt
characteristic
overpowers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brightgolden
color
with
a
smallmedium
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
reminds
me
of
another
beer
ive
had
but
i
cant
think
of
it
right
now
is
it
stones
101010
or
is
it
lips
of
faith
super
cru
it
may
be
super
cru
either
way
although
it
reminds
of
that
beer
i
feel
this
one
has
more
balance
to
it
and
more
depth
scent
is
so
strong
with
sweet
herbs
and
spices
some
tropical
fruit
aromas
and
booze
as
well
taste
is
initially
sweet
honey
and
palatetingling
spices
the
herbal
notes
seem
to
dance
around
through
each
sip
gradually
changing
from
sweet
to
earthy
alcohol
is
not
wellhidden
in
this
beer
although
i
dont
think
it
is
meant
to
be
the
grapes
dont
really
come
through
until
this
beer
warms
a
bit
but
still
subtle
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
somewhat
syrupy
finish
drinkability
is
fair
to
fairly
high
overall
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
too
much
of
this
very
rich
with
a
lot
going
on
definitely
out
of
the
ordinary
and
its
guaranteed
that
is
what
dogfish
intended
cheers
o
great
interesting
different
beer
would
definitely
buy
agaid
o
really
enjoying
this
just
a
totally
different
beer
the
only
thing
that
really
comes
close
to
this
for
me
is
the
nomisugi
that
cambridge
brewing
made
worth
trying
this
is
the
last
beer
i
will
be
reviewing
as
a
pennsylvanian
and
before
the
big
move
to
clearwater
florida
personally
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
though
obviously
so
far
off
from
being
a
beer
that
im
not
sure
it
qualifies
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
word
still
it
will
probably
appeal
to
any
wine
drinker
and
even
to
the
more
adventurous
beer
lover
well
worth
a
try
even
if
not
for
the
novelty
of
drinking
from
a
9000yearold
recipe
overall
this
is
another
good
yet
interesting
offering
from
dogfish
head
being
a
recreation
of
a
9000
yearold
recipe
from
the
far
east
it
is
unlike
anything
i
have
tasted
before
it
is
complex
and
well
balanced
full
of
new
flavors
o
very
interesting
brew
from
dogfish
i
like
the
fact
that
is
made
based
on
one
of
the
oldest
recipes
for
beer
some
9000
years
ago
not
my
favorite
from
dfh
but
very
interesting
to
say
the
least
it
pours
a
bright
deep
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
colored
head
leaves
behind
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
smells
malty
and
sweet
with
hints
of
warm
spices
tastes
very
sweet
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
reisling
wine
very
little
hoppy
scent
or
character
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
to
me
mouthfeel
is
not
exceptional
in
any
way
the
alcohol
and
spices
are
muted
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
overall
not
an
exceptional
beer
its
good
but
it
doesnt
appeal
to
my
particular
tastes
unlike
midas
and
theobroma
which
were
quite
similar
this
one
is
a
real
difference
light
easy
drinking
probably
well
pairing
and
so
peary
quite
nice
o
unique
experience
drinking
this
beer
with
an
interesting
blend
of
ingredients
that
being
said
it
was
more
like
a
one
time
experience
and
probably
not
something
that
i
would
grab
again
overall
to
give
this
a
comparison
to
the
wine
world
it
would
have
to
be
sauternes
it
has
tropical
fruit
heavy
body
sweetness
and
slight
syrup
though
a
lot
of
the
best
sauternes
avoid
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
dessert
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
in
sips
and
a
glass
at
a
time
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
beer
cannot
be
recapped
and
saved
for
another
time
it
can
be
a
bit
much
drinking
a
whole
750ml
by
yourself
at
one
time
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
have
as
dessert
or
with
dessert
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
orange
color
expected
red
for
some
reason
the
head
fizzled
away
pretty
quickly
just
leaving
a
white
ring
the
smell
is
sweet
and
has
a
good
herbal
aroma
to
it
the
taste
gives
off
a
wine
like
flavor
along
with
some
floral
and
fruity
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
here
and
its
pretty
smooth
also
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
sometime
because
its
been
a
while
this
deserves
another
taste
for
sure
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
i
would
buy
this
weekly
if
it
was
available
everywhere
o
this
is
a
really
nice
simple
sweet
beer
4
if
you
are
a
fan
of
nontraditional
beers
or
honey
beers
this
is
a
must
try
it
came
out
an
unfiltered
light
tan
orangeish
color
a
slight
head
the
nose
i
caught
a
very
sweet
smell
of
honey
lighter
fruits
like
grapes
apples
and
pears
the
taste
was
pretty
much
spot
on
very
sweet
to
the
palette
lots
of
honey
and
fruits
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
underneath
which
was
expected
with
a
beer
that
has
10
abv
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
full
to
medium
body
i
guess
having
such
a
sweet
taste
but
sort
of
balanced
out
by
the
carbonation
overall
i
like
what
dogfish
head
does
but
this
wasnt
one
for
me
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
almost
like
a
mead
to
say
the
least
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
sweeter
beers
in
the
style
of
a
mead
you
will
like
this
no
you
probably
will
love
this
m
mediumbodied
some
carbonation
that
cleanses
the
palate
getting
it
ready
for
another
sip
the
10
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
give
this
to
wine
lovers
to
get
them
interested
in
craft
beer
had
this
in
a
750ml
bottle
kind
of
similar
to
a
tripel
in
some
ways
id
say
but
with
its
own
flair
poured
honeygolden
with
some
haziness
and
a
very
thin
head
some
carbonation
aroma
is
honey
sweet
with
light
fruits
coming
through
taste
is
similar
honey
sweet
wine
yeast
breadiness
light
fruits
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
bit
of
syrupy
film
left
behind
and
an
alcohol
bite
enjoyable
and
quaffable
but
definitely
an
everyonceinawhile
beer
as
with
many
dfh
beers
it
was
one
of
many
gateway
brews
for
me
that
has
just
lost
its
luster
over
the
years
still
extra
points
overall
for
innovation
d
mild
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
at
first
but
gets
a
bit
sweet
at
the
end
a
very
sweet
finish
t
i
dont
think
ive
ever
tried
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
before
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
white
grapes
honey
and
a
bit
of
orange
it
reminds
me
of
stones
101010
ve
but
i
like
this
one
a
lot
better
it
has
a
lot
of
wine
qualities
while
still
keeping
some
that
make
it
a
beer
really
glad
to
get
to
try
this
one
overall
i
find
this
style
weird
but
very
palatable
like
all
ales
from
dogfish
head
i
never
know
what
to
expect
o
overall
pretty
enjoyable
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
in
bottle
often
but
if
it
is
on
tap
at
dfh
i
will
probably
get
it
again
pretty
easy
drinking
with
no
sign
of
10
this
ale
pours
a
light
gold
color
from
a
750ml
bottle
small
sized
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
grapes
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
light
taste
of
hops
are
citrusy
interesting
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
mixing
and
matching
here
some
orange
some
honey
some
grapes
spices
nice
carbonation
yet
another
beer
in
a
line
of
slightly
weird
off
the
mainstream
beers
from
dogfish
head
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
tastes
almost
like
wine
wont
buy
again
but
it
was
drinkable
and
interesting
this
beer
is
likely
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
enjoy
you
can
always
count
on
dogfish
head
for
an
interesting
beer
chateau
jiahu
is
just
that
how
is
it
not
bad
its
not
great
either
the
sweetness
could
definitely
be
dialed
back
a
little
i
dont
mind
the
grape
flavor
but
the
floral
element
of
it
tastes
a
little
weird
maybe
a
little
less
would
be
more
its
definitely
interesting
and
is
worth
picking
up
at
least
once
overall
this
beer
is
so
typically
dfh
very
damn
tasty
indeed
i
love
the
highly
creative
and
very
different
beer
this
effort
produced
overall
its
a
4
0
beer
very
enjoyable
and
unique
and
pleasant
but
very
dogfish
d
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
but
again
this
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
from
a
dogfish
brew
light
and
sweet
enough
to
have
wide
appeal
but
complex
enough
to
satisfy
the
beer
geek
in
me
d
glad
to
say
i
tried
it
but
not
for
me
way
too
sweet
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
ampedup
midas
touch
pours
a
clear
golden
with
thin
fizzy
head
good
apparant
carbonation
nose
is
tart
and
sour
light
fruits
phenol
grapes
taste
is
similiar
sweet
mild
honey
sour
grape
juice
noticeable
alcohol
warmth
light
to
medium
dry
mouthfeel
drinkable
as
a
bomber
perhaps
for
an
occasion
but
not
to
be
retried
by
me
i
do
own
a
second
bottle
and
will
be
aging
it
to
see
how
it
changes
i
hope
it
was
a
bad
bottle
based
on
what
i
had
heard
on
tap
at
the
mellow
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
goblet
a
medium
to
darker
golden
with
a
thin
quick
to
fade
white
headwhite
grap
juice
aromas
along
with
sweet
honeya
little
leafy
heb
in
there
as
well
sweet
white
grape
skins
and
honey
flavors
dominatethere
is
enough
of
herbal
dryness
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
sweet
its
pretty
goodits
not
nearly
as
complex
as
i
would
have
thoughtnice
to
try
it
but
one
and
done
is
good
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
in
my
opinion
the
beer
comes
off
as
a
touch
undercarbonated
in
the
end
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
probably
ever
go
back
to
its
certainly
an
interesting
brew
and
theres
something
pretty
cool
about
drinking
a
beer
based
off
a
9000
year
old
recipe
perhaps
a
touch
gimmicky
but
worth
checking
out
just
for
the
experience
drinkability
although
i
like
the
character
of
this
brew
its
a
little
two
wine
like
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
its
just
not
for
me
d
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
out
again
d
superior
drinkability
extremely
smooth
10
alcohol
it
could
be
a
bit
of
a
sneaky
drink
overall
an
excellent
bottle
of
beer
was
sad
when
the
bottle
was
empty
its
no
wonder
this
was
the
last
bottle
left
at
the
store
would
probably
go
well
with
some
spicy
stir
fry
notes
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
good
pairing
to
chinese
spring
rolls
with
duck
sauce
d
a
decent
beer
for
casual
sipping
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
one
d
the
taste
is
interesting
and
different
from
other
beers
ive
tasted
i
dont
know
what
to
think
of
it
but
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
drink
too
much
of
this
its
just
a
bit
too
confusing
for
my
taste
buds
and
hard
to
enjoy
because
of
that
reason
im
glad
i
tasted
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
another
bottle
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
in
many
respects
being
a
lover
of
mead
i
appreciate
the
similar
qualities
to
be
found
in
the
brew
along
with
the
lovely
color
and
aroma
the
high
abv
also
makes
this
one
great
too
as
one
may
really
appreciate
this
drink
like
a
wine
as
well
as
a
beer
further
the
antiquity
of
the
recipe
that
the
beer
is
based
on
adds
a
truly
novel
quality
that
gives
me
even
greater
respect
for
dogfish
heads
fine
craft
i
will
certainly
be
buying
a
bottle
of
my
own
soon
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
lacing
is
moderate
aromas
of
grapes
honey
slight
malts
and
raisins
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
an
almost
flat
winelike
feel
before
ending
in
a
creamy
and
slick
finish
flavors
of
grapes
and
raisins
abound
with
hints
of
honey
and
a
nice
light
malt
finish
i
needed
a
break
from
my
recent
binge
of
trappistes
quads
and
i
thought
what
better
way
to
mix
it
up
than
with
one
of
dog
heads
ancient
brews
i
grabbed
this
from
the
hyde
park
market
on
45th
in
austin
best
beer
selection
in
the
city
and
im
glad
that
i
made
it
my
choice
my
wife
and
i
are
about
to
go
see
little
dragon
live
and
are
enjoying
this
sweet
brew
while
watching
radiohead
on
a
directv
channel
101
recording
maybe
its
the
music
but
were
loving
this
jiahu
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
its
amber
golden
but
hearty
its
got
a
high
abv
but
you
cant
tell
its
got
a
hint
of
a
sweet
wine
but
still
has
the
balls
of
a
solid
beer
its
expensive
but
very
worth
it
well
done
dog
fish
d
super
drinkable
all
night
just
exclaimed
that
i
should
have
gotten
three
bottles
instead
of
two
overall
glad
i
tried
it
though
i
definitely
can
see
why
the
ratings
are
all
over
the
map
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
i
have
had
but
that
is
dogfish
for
you
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
love
them
feels
like
a
9000
year
old
recipe
if
that
makes
any
sense
d
not
really
my
bag
fourthbeer
potential
very
high
in
all
honesty
i
was
enjoying
this
beer
way
too
much
and
drank
it
too
fast
the
high
abv
is
completely
unnoticeable
and
is
almost
dangerous
because
more
is
better
for
this
one
an
excellent
effort
by
dogfish
head
but
does
that
really
surprise
anyone
thanks
cam
pours
a
golden
orange
with
almost
no
head
well
carbonated
but
no
head
from
it
smells
grapey
up
the
wazoo
im
disappointed
that
its
so
one
dimensional
tastes
very
grapey
all
i
can
taste
is
muscat
grapes
im
not
sure
what
hawthorn
tastes
like
but
i
dont
taste
much
else
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
dwell
the
tastes
start
to
blend
more
together
but
it
still
tastes
decent
and
it
does
go
down
quite
easily
this
isnt
something
id
buy
a
lot
of
d
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
ever
had
my
absolute
favorite
and
probably
similar
to
what
god
would
drink
if
not
the
same
heavenly
brew
4
0
d
at
first
i
thought
this
wouldnt
be
very
drinkable
due
to
the
sweetness
however
the
palate
becomes
desensitized
to
the
sweetness
very
quickly
which
i
found
surprising
i
only
had
half
a
bottle
but
found
myself
wanting
more
d
eh
weird
d
even
with
the
heavy
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
makes
this
really
slick
and
an
easy
drink
danger
will
robinson
glass
snifter
i
had
no
problem
splitting
the
750ml
bottle
with
my
wife
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
beer
i
am
likely
to
buy
again
in
the
future
notes
love
the
back
story
of
this
beer
but
i
found
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
beer
more
than
the
story
d
the
ancient
beer
series
from
different
breweries
dogfish
especially
are
very
intriguing
although
i
dont
think
ive
enjoyed
one
more
than
this
one
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
spices
and
it
works
not
super
drinkable
a
goblet
is
no
problem
but
i
definatly
wouldnt
want
a
whole
bottle
it
didnt
go
well
with
my
black
and
blue
burger
i
didnt
really
think
it
would
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
nor
would
i
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
light
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
at
least
as
far
as
longevity
is
concerned
the
smell
is
essentially
the
white
grape
tannins
and
a
sweet
rice
aroma
overall
the
smell
is
rather
weak
the
taste
however
is
rather
nice
the
background
is
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
rice
lager
or
happoshu
but
the
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
the
flavor
of
the
white
grapes
really
helps
to
make
this
beer
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
and
i
assume
the
combination
of
sake
yeast
and
white
grapes
would
contribute
to
that
but
this
is
still
a
rather
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
if
offered
to
me
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
personally
buy
another
bottle
of
it
slightly
syrupy
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
pretty
well
carbonated
the
unique
kind
of
beer
that
will
warrant
a
revisit
just
not
a
lot
in
a
sitting
d
too
sweet
the
kind
of
thing
that
girls
who
dont
like
beer
would
like
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
mead
which
is
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
its
a
good
idea
but
a
bad
execution
d
its
best
to
share
the
bottle
and
your
thoughts
with
some
company
it
is
very
sweet
and
kind
of
confusing
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
masked
10abv
pretty
thick
and
chewy
and
very
sweet
so
it
is
going
to
be
a
slow
one
but
this
is
still
very
good
and
was
a
nice
after
dinner
styled
beer
could
i
have
drank
2
hell
no
but
be
sure
to
give
it
a
shot
becuase
its
definitely
one
of
a
kind
now
time
to
pop
a
berserker
and
go
party
with
phish
to
send
out
2010
d
this
was
a
complete
shock
to
me
excellent
and
such
a
differently
refreshing
beer
i
will
definitely
want
to
have
this
beer
again
could
be
a
fine
summer
beer
if
you
are
adventurous
or
just
love
dogfish
heads
search
for
unique
brew
experiences
get
this
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
worth
trying
of
course
the
description
of
making
this
beer
from
a
9000
year
old
recipe
is
quite
appealing
too
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
one
is
not
for
consecutive
consumption
overall
an
absolute
treat
delicious
i
will
be
keeping
a
regular
stock
of
this
brew
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
complex
and
i
am
sure
i
am
missing
some
aspects
of
it
i
get
some
flowers
orange
citrus
bready
malt
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
also
complex
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
but
i
also
get
some
nuttyness
flowers
perfume
orange
citrus
maple
sugar
and
apples
i
also
get
a
nice
dose
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
the
beer
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
although
it
does
get
a
little
bit
cloying
at
the
end
due
to
the
high
sugar
content
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
very
interesting
back
story
of
all
the
ancient
ales
brewed
by
dogfish
head
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
spiced
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
havent
had
many
though
but
this
one
is
top
notch
for
a
style
i
dont
try
too
often
very
good
brew
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
perfectly
i
was
sucked
into
the
hype
of
the
beer
after
watching
the
show
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
from
the
honey
side
all
i
tasted
was
the
sweetness
like
an
apple
cider
without
the
bite
the
more
i
let
it
sit
the
more
i
got
the
syrup
taste
of
sour
grapes
not
my
favortite
beer
by
far
it
was
worth
a
one
off
but
i
wont
pay
12
again
for
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
some
unique
flavors
to
it
i
do
not
think
this
is
one
of
dogfish
heads
better
beers
it
was
worth
trying
though
i
will
not
buy
it
again
d
not
very
drinkable
a
strong
syrupy
sweet
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
know
this
has
barley
in
it
its
just
that
i
cant
really
tell
by
drinking
it
if
you
told
me
this
was
a
meadlate
harvest
white
wine
blend
then
id
be
sold
the
8
points
of
booze
are
well
obfuscated
by
the
strong
sweetness
and
thoughts
of
beer
are
generally
subsumed
its
cool
that
dfh
is
trying
to
revive
lost
beer
styles
but
they
are
also
blurring
the
border
between
actual
beer
and
other
alcoholic
beverages
d
too
sweet
for
me
i
dont
know
how
i
will
finish
this
bomber
however
im
really
enjoying
this
glass
taste
more
like
a
sweet
wine
than
a
beer
im
used
to
dogfish
heads
beer
tasting
very
complex
with
this
beer
a
missed
that
i
know
the
recipe
wasnt
simple
per
se
but
the
taste
was
kind
of
singular
or
dual
i
guess
grape
juice
and
honey
not
that
it
wasnt
fun
to
drink
in
fact
the
apv
snuck
up
on
me
like
a
ninja
at
night
i
like
this
for
a
session
beer
with
someone
whos
not
a
beer
person
its
the
dogfish
beer
that
i
would
suggest
to
a
layperson
a
layperson
who
i
want
to
get
drunk
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
its
a
decent
experimental
brew
though
d
this
midas
touch
and
theobroma
appear
to
be
quite
similar
being
separated
by
few
nuances
complex
and
interesting
but
does
not
initially
compel
me
to
have
another
slightly
flat
on
draft
so
i
want
to
try
this
from
the
bottle
this
once
again
shows
that
dfh
knows
how
to
make
an
offcentered
beer
and
come
through
with
it
im
loving
their
obscure
beers
and
the
chateau
is
no
exception
well
done
id
like
another
amazingly
smooth
with
the
honey
right
upfront
a
nice
balanced
light
malt
body
dominates
with
the
grapes
strongly
pulling
up
the
rear
you
can
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
grapes
when
you
lick
your
lips
after
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
fruit
themed
beers
and
i
know
this
one
isnt
trying
to
be
but
every
brewery
trying
to
get
fruit
down
should
grab
some
ideas
from
this
overall
while
there
are
many
things
to
like
about
this
brew
what
we
liked
most
was
the
idea
itself
of
gathering
a
9000
year
old
recipe
and
the
chic
attractive
label
design
the
aroma
is
wildly
fruity
and
complex
and
the
sweetness
is
while
apparent
mysteriously
well
controlled
for
a
surprisingly
refreshing
brew
d
very
drinkable
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
would
prevent
one
from
finishing
the
bottle
i
was
very
interested
in
trying
this
one
because
of
the
story
behind
it
and
it
did
not
disappoint
in
the
least
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
because
i
appreciate
the
age
and
history
in
the
brew
i
just
think
that
we
are
better
at
brewing
these
days
pours
an
oranish
clear
color
with
no
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
honey
grapes
and
some
other
sweetnees
the
nose
is
appealing
with
a
almost
champagne
smell
the
taste
has
a
tartness
from
the
grapes
with
a
strong
honey
sweetness
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
a
bit
creamy
with
a
slight
bite
to
it
the
creamy
feel
is
in
the
middle
and
then
the
bite
comes
out
the
drinkability
is
good
is
an
easy
drink
with
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
very
similar
to
others
out
there
drinks
like
a
smooth
light
wine
finishes
like
an
approachable
sake
mmm
sushi
or
perhaps
a
spicy
thai
curry
notes
very
tasty
seems
to
have
that
sweetness
than
is
presentn
many
dfh
brews
another
reason
why
they
are
the
best
first
sip
is
interesting
at
first
it
doesnt
really
come
out
to
you
as
very
different
from
any
other
beer
but
there
are
things
to
this
that
are
different
than
what
you
usually
taste
in
a
beer
id
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
really
a
story
about
subtlety
its
in
the
ingredients
that
you
really
find
what
makes
this
so
special
and
although
i
do
enjoy
the
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
over
a
six
pack
of
coffee
stout
or
barleywine
still
with
such
a
history
behind
it
you
really
should
treat
yourself
to
it
sometime
if
molecular
biologist
patrick
e
mcgovern
is
correct
and
neolithic
chinese
shaman
were
connecting
with
the
spiritual
world
through
the
use
of
brews
like
this
i
can
understand
why
they
would
be
eager
to
partake
in
such
undertakings
okay
by
almost
any
standard
drinkable
but
it
seems
like
they
are
treading
over
ground
theyve
already
covered
and
tastes
suspiciously
similar
to
the
other
historical
recreations
perhaps
its
the
honey
and
grapes
that
dominate
the
remaining
characteristic
nuances
that
set
this
apart
because
it
definitely
doesnt
seem
to
be
doing
it
any
favours
in
that
department
unless
its
to
represent
that
most
of
these
beers
in
their
day
were
a
fermentable
carbohydrate
blended
with
fermented
grapes
and
honey
as
well
as
a
standard
on
par
worth
trying
once
and
after
that
it
comes
down
to
personal
whim
although
i
enjoy
most
of
what
dogfish
head
has
to
offer
after
this
one
i
now
await
their
next
historical
recreation
that
spotlights
fermented
honey
and
grapes
as
that
seems
to
be
the
trend
not
really
actually
poured
in
a
chalice
a
hazy
peachorange
color
with
a
pinkish
hue
to
it
it
has
barely
a
head
with
the
moderate
lacing
of
a
tripel
perhaps
looks
welldeveloped
the
smell
is
of
grapes
dominating
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
of
this
brew
its
fruity
and
flowery
and
i
noticed
that
it
has
a
similar
berry
taste
to
the
fort
for
a
10
abv
brew
this
is
wellcrafted
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
on
a
scale
of
heaviness
the
blend
of
exotic
fruit
and
ingredients
is
clutch
as
always
with
dogfish
head
i
have
now
been
able
to
compare
this
to
the
previous
years
and
the
only
difference
is
that
i
noticed
the
honey
a
little
bit
more
last
year
than
i
did
this
time
around
an
all
around
solid
and
interesting
brew
and
this
comes
as
no
surprise
from
dfh
d
old
but
good
this
brew
reminds
me
a
lot
of
midas
touch
with
the
honey
and
white
grape
ive
got
to
say
that
it
holds
up
very
well
with
age
im
gonna
grab
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
for
comparison
but
its
enjoyable
even
after
four
years
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
creamy
white
head
with
good
retentiongolden
amber
in
color
fragrantly
fruity
honey
apple
and
grapes
very
sweet
kinda
reminds
me
of
sweet
apple
cider
drysweet
bitter
mouth
finish
if
your
into
sweet
beer
this
is
defiantly
for
you
big
fan
of
most
dog
fish
brews
but
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
drinkability
its
just
too
sweet
im
glad
i
split
it
not
as
bad
as
sahtea
but
still
just
to
sweet
for
my
taste
d
the
sweetness
results
in
this
beer
being
a
bit
of
a
sipper
well
made
interesting
and
enjoyable
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
into
might
tulip
a
slight
amount
of
haze
and
a
light
head
and
some
lacing
that
falls
a
bit
too
quickly
the
nose
is
spice
with
some
green
apple
grapes
and
honey
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
tad
bit
of
spicing
and
some
mild
fruit
flavors
zesty
feel
with
a
nice
body
drinks
pretty
well
a
nice
and
interesting
brew
light
bodied
beer
with
a
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
that
hits
the
tongue
sharply
refreshing
for
a
beer
with
8
abv
and
decently
drinkable
but
just
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
this
to
be
d
a
little
boozy
at
the
finish
but
otherwise
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
chug
even
if
so
inclined
this
beer
poured
a
nice
medium
amber
color
and
had
a
small
head
that
dissipated
and
left
a
small
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
looked
pretty
carbonated
smelled
of
honey
grape
rice
and
maybe
a
touch
of
alcohol
you
could
really
taste
the
honey
it
was
great
at
first
but
got
a
little
too
sweet
the
more
and
more
i
drank
it
the
sweetness
thing
wasnt
too
much
of
a
deal
for
me
this
is
different
from
what
i
usually
drink
and
it
was
definetly
refreshing
had
a
good
mouthfeel
on
this
it
was
nice
and
creamy
and
had
less
carbonation
that
i
thought
it
would
it
had
a
nice
medium
body
the
drinkability
was
good
on
this
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
another
one
of
these
cheers
d
i
respect
what
they
did
here
and
i
totally
get
it
however
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
glass
surprisingly
sweet
refreshing
and
very
delicious
this
will
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
hopheads
taste
but
fans
of
maltier
beers
might
like
it
a
lot
as
i
am
right
now
really
a
treat
although
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
despite
the
bubblyappearance
this
is
actually
smooth
i
think
it
should
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
but
this
isnt
horrible
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
beer
i
am
glad
that
dogfish
head
is
willing
to
push
the
bounds
so
we
can
taste
something
similar
from
historys
past
it
is
a
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
a
gold
apricot
in
color
no
cloudiness
a
thin
head
white
in
color
that
disaptes
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
low
carbination
sweet
grapey
almost
sakeish
smell
different
you
can
taste
the
the
grape
and
honey
right
up
front
there
is
a
flavor
there
i
do
not
recongize
must
be
the
hawthorne
fruit
descent
beer
but
dogfish
makes
better
d
overall
for
what
it
is
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
such
an
ancient
recipe
would
taste
so
clean
though
i
see
this
one
as
more
of
a
novelty
brew
one
im
happy
to
experiment
with
but
seems
a
little
onedimensional
to
me
very
good
pretty
crisp
when
the
beer
is
chilled
none
of
the
flavors
are
overwhelming
but
when
the
beer
warms
up
the
hawthorn
comes
to
the
front
and
i
dis
not
really
care
for
it
d
an
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
but
its
more
of
a
curiosity
than
anything
else
awesome
beer
its
pretty
unique
very
much
enjoyed
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
pleasent
d
this
would
be
nice
as
a
sweet
dessert
wine
its
priced
like
one
too
and
would
make
a
unique
hostess
gift
for
a
dinner
party
i
would
drink
it
again
but
at
this
price
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
the
flavors
werent
quite
distinct
or
smooth
enough
to
make
it
anything
more
still
worth
a
shot
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
dfhs
other
experimental
beers
i
had
this
brew
during
a
tour
of
the
brewery
and
liked
it
most
of
the
four
they
allowed
us
to
sample
i
bought
a
bottle
and
brought
it
home
i
decided
to
share
it
with
my
wife
since
it
was
very
sweet
after
dinner
we
opened
the
bottle
and
it
was
nothing
like
the
brew
i
remember
from
the
brewery
it
reminded
me
of
a
miller
lite
with
honey
thrown
in
it
was
very
light
highly
carbonated
and
had
that
corn
brewed
taste
the
sweetness
was
not
nearly
what
i
remembered
it
to
be
if
i
were
to
rate
this
during
the
tap
pour
it
would
have
probably
gotten
much
higher
scores
i
love
dfh
brews
but
this
one
that
i
will
pass
on
next
time
cheers
way
to
go
sam
again
i
love
the
ancient
brews
and
this
one
is
exceptional
d
its
an
interesting
brew
but
a
bit
off
of
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
now
with
some
cheese
and
clover
honey
we
might
have
something
in
the
mouth
is
a
full
honey
flavor
in
the
back
balanced
b
a
tart
grape
flavor
that
masks
most
of
the
sweetness
finnishes
with
a
slight
pineapple
flavor
this
was
interesting
and
good
but
not
one
id
drink
all
the
time
overall
this
is
just
not
a
winner
or
repeatable
price
18
d
even
though
i
feel
that
it
lost
something
being
a
year
old
beer
i
still
feel
it
is
good
the
taste
is
not
as
good
but
it
did
not
change
too
much
from
what
i
remember
just
more
of
the
white
wine
comes
out
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
again
will
drink
it
when
it
is
fresher
and
rereview
it
i
cracked
open
a
bottle
dated
from
2006
it
poured
a
murky
gold
with
a
lot
of
sediment
the
sediment
was
actually
pretty
chunky
but
not
a
turn
off
at
all
it
had
a
very
slight
cream
colored
head
the
smell
was
very
strong
of
muscat
grapes
the
smell
was
a
little
faded
however
showing
its
age
but
it
smelled
very
appealing
and
of
a
white
wine
the
taste
was
very
good
it
was
like
a
white
wine
mixed
with
a
light
belgian
the
taste
was
excellent
and
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
the
beer
was
still
moderately
carbonated
it
was
very
drinkable
and
aged
rather
well
i
recommend
this
one
id
hit
it
again
d
decent
drinkablility
except
for
the
abv
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
hard
if
youre
not
careful
all
told
this
is
an
interesting
beer
initially
is
posesses
a
lot
of
characterists
of
beers
that
are
hard
to
drink
though
goes
down
smoothly
despite
the
alcohol
content
a
liked
this
a
lot
better
than
i
did
another
from
the
ancient
ales
series
from
dfh
this
beer
gets
marks
for
its
heritage
and
creation
otherwise
the
score
may
have
been
lower
im
just
glad
this
is
not
the
only
beer
available
as
i
will
probably
only
ever
drink
this
again
once
tastes
like
unfiltered
sake
meets
chardonnay
meets
american
malt
liquor
green
grapes
are
prominent
and
the
rice
wort
is
honeyed
and
plenty
evident
interesting
and
strange
but
intriguingly
drinkable
sharp
brittle
bite
on
the
finish
and
nearly
has
as
much
sake
flavor
as
hitichino
xs
not
as
complex
as
xs
but
plenty
interesting
in
its
own
right
might
not
be
worth
the
price
but
it
was
damn
fun
to
try
at
least
once
d
its
suprisingly
drinkable
with
all
the
strange
flavors
it
packs
cheers
d
pretty
good
beer
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
like
i
said
i
love
the
historic
beers
from
dfh
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
isnt
something
i
would
drink
often
at
all
but
in
the
right
circumstance
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
can
really
tie
things
together
certainly
drinkable
with
the
wife
and
i
happily
splitting
the
bottle
and
putting
it
on
the
grocery
list
to
buy
again
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
as
the
interesting
flavors
will
continue
to
hold
your
palates
attention
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
masked
so
i
think
i
would
try
this
again
i
like
chateau
jiahu
but
i
dont
love
it
it
is
an
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
but
i
sipped
it
for
a
long
time
and
was
thinking
about
what
i
was
going
to
order
next
about
half
way
through
d
highly
drinkable
totally
worth
the
14750ml
5
0
it
still
has
a
syrup
kicker
but
you
know
what
its
st
patricks
day
and
i
am
drinking
a
damn
good
beer
you
cant
beat
that
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
very
small
head
and
appropriately
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
honey
peach
white
grapes
lemon
and
coriander
the
taste
is
similar
with
notes
of
honey
white
grapes
citrus
blood
orange
and
lemon
zest
the
body
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
or
the
lightest
side
of
heavy
whichever
with
relatively
low
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
syrupy
feel
leading
to
a
high
but
hindered
drinkability
it
would
be
a
bit
higher
if
the
body
were
slightly
thinner
and
the
abv
a
tad
lower
those
ancient
chinese
had
a
winner
here
could
have
used
a
little
less
sweetness
apparently
this
beer
wasnt
bottleconditioned
i
think
the
yeast
would
have
helped
to
diminish
the
sweetness
and
also
add
another
layer
of
flavor
complexity
still
pretty
good
though
verdict
as
with
all
of
the
dogfish
head
historical
beers
this
in
an
unexpected
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
treat
a
unique
blend
of
flavors
chateau
jiahu
is
a
worthwhile
and
interesting
brew
this
surpassed
my
expectations
as
a
unique
brew
drinkable
yes
will
i
pursue
it
again
nope
but
definetly
worth
a
try
to
learn
what
this
beverage
is
like
very
cool
background
story
intense
unique
beer
another
well
done
experiment
by
dfh
i
really
like
this
one
overall
id
say
it
met
my
expectations
based
on
reading
the
bottle
fruity
sweet
and
flowery
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
but
ill
wait
til
next
year
to
try
it
again
d
drinkability
was
decent
unique
and
a
good
one
time
treat
not
something
i
could
see
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
but
nice
to
taste
a
part
of
history
share
a
bomber
with
a
friend
and
some
good
beer
stories
and
history
while
drinking
a
part
of
it
d
loses
no
points
in
the
personality
department
but
what
makes
the
chateau
jiahu
so
unique
and
interesting
is
also
what
keeps
the
drinkability
rating
average
halfway
through
the
bottle
the
sweetness
became
bothersome
and
somewhat
cloying
a
bottle
this
big
needs
to
be
shared
several
ways
cheers
to
dfh
for
a
successful
experiment
and
for
the
reinterpretationrecreation
of
a
9000
year
old
brew
d
a
pretty
strong
brew
i
shared
it
with
my
friends
and
since
i
was
in
recovery
from
a
pretty
loathsome
illness
it
hit
me
pretty
hard
but
id
like
to
have
another
now
that
im
on
my
feet
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
light
taste
is
too
sweet
for
high
drinkability
the
mouth
was
really
light
with
low
carbonation
no
bitterness
but
the
sourness
really
does
its
work
its
a
lot
like
a
lambic
too
sour
for
my
taste
but
good
overall
very
interesting
the
beer
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
ok
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
light
with
cinnamon
grape
juice
and
light
brown
sugar
flavors
replicate
the
nose
but
this
beer
is
bit
sweeter
then
id
like
or
was
expecting
with
lots
of
sweet
grape
juice
there
is
some
slight
honey
and
citrus
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
counter
the
grapy
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
while
i
appreciate
the
amount
of
flavor
in
this
beer
the
excessive
sweetness
and
noticeable
booziness
make
this
beer
a
bit
difficult
to
take
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
flavor
is
much
more
pleasing
if
not
terribly
different
from
the
nose
lots
of
white
grape
notes
sweetness
of
honey
some
strong
floral
notes
presumably
from
the
chrysanthemum
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
boost
in
carbonation
but
otherwise
its
a
fairly
welldone
effort
interesting
and
worth
seeking
out
on
its
own
merits
some
of
dfhs
bombers
can
be
hitormiss
but
this
is
one
of
their
best
along
with
midas
there
are
flavors
here
that
you
just
dont
find
in
99
of
beers
and
for
that
reason
alone
its
worth
a
try
not
my
favorite
offering
from
dfh
overall
distinct
and
experimental
i
enjoyed
it
but
others
may
not
due
to
the
sweetness
even
though
its
not
overpowering
d
definitely
an
interesting
recipe
and
one
to
be
shared
with
friends
at
8
abv
its
like
a
mildly
fortified
malty
wine
it
paired
quite
nicely
with
cracked
pepper
and
olive
oil
crackers
topped
with
cheddar
sips
pretty
well
on
its
own
too
this
is
some
great
stuff
thanks
to
edbeer
for
sharing
750ml
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
tulip
poured
a
goldenorange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
skim
clarity
is
hazy
just
shy
of
translucent
nose
is
grapes
and
bubblegum
taste
consistent
with
nose
maybe
the
addition
of
some
orange
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
consistent
and
mild
background
effervescence
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
however
probably
my
favorite
of
dfhs
historical
brews
drinkability
it
was
definitely
a
unique
experience
but
i
cant
see
myself
running
out
and
drinking
this
all
the
time
neat
experience
worth
trying
and
for
sharing
with
others
but
i
doubt
i
could
finish
a
whole
bottle
myself
over
an
evening
overall
jiahu
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
share
this
bottle
between
the
two
dfh
ancient
ales
that
ive
tried
jiahu
is
favored
over
theobroma
i
would
buy
this
from
time
to
time
just
for
something
a
little
different
notes
leans
on
the
expensive
side
for
the
dfh
specialty
bottles
and
that
may
be
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
the
experiment
works
and
its
historical
investigation
is
enticing
enough
part
of
a
foundation
is
shared
with
other
dfh
brews
such
as
midas
touch
or
theobroma
not
a
bad
thing
but
not
a
great
one
either
in
terms
of
the
experience
if
you
are
familiar
with
some
of
those
it
may
have
a
repetitive
echo
to
it
it
remains
a
great
brew
in
any
case
its
not
one
that
i
will
be
having
on
my
own
or
highlighting
often
but
i
sure
plan
to
have
on
my
table
at
group
meeting
and
in
particular
to
provoke
bubbly
drinkers
a
very
interesting
beer
my
only
problem
is
that
it
just
doesnt
stand
apart
from
midas
touch
or
theobroma
the
flavors
that
i
am
looking
for
are
only
hiding
in
the
background
the
creative
current
behind
the
beer
is
quite
interesting
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
body
is
very
light
as
can
be
expected
from
the
rice
a
lingering
soursweetness
hides
behind
mediumheavy
carbonation
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
dogfish
head
rest
and
pub
in
falls
church
va
and
i
must
say
i
was
expecting
the
beer
to
be
poured
slightly
warmer
at
close
to
32
degrees
it
took
a
while
for
this
to
warm
up
enough
to
be
flavorful
and
even
then
it
was
a
bit
light
for
me
regardless
of
the
outcome
i
love
the
ideas
but
forth
by
sam
and
the
team
at
dogfish
way
to
pave
some
new
old
roads
a
great
example
of
something
new
and
exciting
drinkability
overall
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
not
the
best
dfh
this
was
served
on
draught
at
dogfish
head
pub
in
gaithersburg
md
beer
is
clear
light
yellow
orange
no
head
to
speak
of
and
minimal
lacing
low
carbonation
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
smell
of
grapes
this
beer
tastes
like
chardonnay
seriously
white
wine
with
grain
im
not
digging
this
beer
all
and
all
its
a
fine
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
dfh
worth
a
look
hard
to
drink
though
d
interesting
diversion
this
would
not
be
a
regular
beer
pretty
good
overall
and
a
very
interesting
idea
for
a
beer
drinkability
what
an
amazingly
different
beer
to
say
the
least
one
of
the
epitome
of
spiced
beers
that
really
sets
the
tone
for
dogfish
heads
ever
expanding
lineup
of
ancient
recipe
beers
i
love
how
the
grapes
in
this
beer
really
show
characteristics
of
wine
as
this
could
be
served
to
a
wine
drinking
only
person
and
actually
be
liked
the
amount
of
spiciness
is
just
enough
to
keep
me
involved
and
interested
with
the
kick
of
alcohol
doing
the
rest
of
the
work
in
the
finish
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
the
8
abv
well
hidden
behind
all
of
these
beautiful
spiced
properties
and
fruit
florals
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
sam
and
the
dogfish
head
crew
that
deserves
its
ranks
as
one
of
the
best
spiced
beers
in
the
world
i
would
definately
order
this
beer
again
im
a
huge
fan
of
these
old
brews
dogfish
seems
to
find
it
was
a
great
beer
to
end
the
warm
florida
night
overall
i
am
really
glad
i
grabbed
the
bottle
of
this
and
will
buy
it
again
d
one
maybe
two
glasses
please
another
wierd
one
from
dfh
another
interesting
beer
coming
from
dfh
they
certainly
like
to
experiment
with
these
ancient
recipes
and
ill
certainly
give
them
a
go
but
i
probably
wont
go
for
this
one
again
simply
put
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
in
my
life
ive
never
even
heard
of
something
as
crazy
as
this
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
it
and
i
called
friends
before
finishing
my
glass
to
buy
a
bottle
if
they
ever
see
it
on
store
shelves
chateau
jiahu
is
a
unique
beer
that
drinks
like
wine
and
a
must
try
for
anything
just
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
im
impressed
not
only
with
the
fact
that
dfh
recreated
this
beverage
but
that
it
tastes
so
darn
tasty
this
is
really
really
unique
and
should
be
commended
for
being
so
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
is
that
for
all
of
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
i
didnt
once
mention
the
malt
bill
dogfish
head
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
attention
to
detail
and
allaround
batshit
insanity
d
very
nice
and
could
drink
a
bunch
alsmost
wine
like
in
its
taste
dogfish
head
has
had
better
showings
than
the
chateau
jihau
drinkability
for
me
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
a
one
a
night
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
enjoying
this
a
much
as
i
did
because
i
usually
dont
care
for
honey
flavor
in
beer
i
certainly
would
drink
this
one
again
d
depending
on
you
fascination
with
spiced
beers
this
is
a
great
offering
from
dfh
that
can
be
enjoyed
more
than
once
in
an
evening
d
im
gonna
have
to
pass
on
this
one
interesting
and
there
is
a
ton
to
appreciate
especially
from
a
time
perspective
would
i
drink
this
on
a
daily
basis
no
and
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
interesting
and
i
applaud
the
effort
but
just
not
my
thing
very
interesting
flavors
are
present
not
sure
what
it
can
be
compared
to
but
by
itself
its
a
sipping
beer
that
is
worthy
if
youd
like
to
think
outside
the
box
on
beer
conclusion
definitely
an
odd
little
number
i
think
people
will
probably
either
love
or
hate
this
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
however
and
the
history
on
this
beer
is
great
in
small
amounts
it
would
be
really
nice
as
an
aperitif
or
paired
with
hors
doeuvres
cheers
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
i
get
the
grape
juice
and
some
honey
there
may
even
be
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
in
the
back
there
but
its
faint
over
all
this
reminds
me
of
midas
touch
a
lot
just
more
expensive
and
not
as
good
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
pours
up
to
a
two
finger
head
before
rapidly
evaporating
to
lilypads
of
foam
across
the
surface
very
little

mediumbodied
very
low
carbonation
almost
makes
it
drink
like
a
still
beverage
its
sweet
yet
somehow
not
as
sweet
as
expected
from
the
nose
has
a
fruit
juice
feel
grapes
blended
with
pear
apricot

the

the
tangerine
citrus
juicy
and
lends
momentary
tang
very
smoothly
textured
with
a
complete
grip
on
the
palate
you
feel
it
everywhere
the
floral
musk
takes
up
more
space
with
each
sip
theres
a
muscular
lift
to
it
so
perfumed
that
as
it
gathers
around
the
roof
of
your
mouth
it
starts
to
pleasantly
dry
out
on
the
tongue
more
interesting
than
compelling
a
bottle
to
share
not
pound
by
yourself
d
pretty
drinkable
for
8
if
you
can
get
past
or
enjoy
the
grape
sodaness
of
this
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
glass
or
two
or
three
all
in
all
this
is
exactly
what
you
think
it
will
be
coming
from
dogfish
unique
bring
to
a
dinner
party
give
as
a
housewarming
gift
or
drink
by
yourself
in
your
underwear
in
front
of
the
tv
any
way
you
slice
it
this
beer
is
awesome
an
interesting
beer
kind
of
a
novelty
it
is
worth
a
try
however
md
the
mouth
is
sweet
with
a
medium
body
and
some
carb
going
for
it
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
without
any
huge
hops
getting
in
the
way
the
drinkability
was
good
as
well
even
though
the
beer
list
stated
that
this
was
11
i
did
not
taste
it
at
all
well
masked
kudos
to
dfh
for
having
the
balls
to
brew
something
like
this
and
releasing
it
annually
unfortunately
this
is
a
big
beer
otherwise
it
could
easily
be
sessionable
the
nose
had
a
slightly
sour
lactic
note
with
some
great
spices
thrown
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
quite
nice
i
really
picked
up
the
grape
flavor
as
it
warmed
the
spices
were
interesting
the
brew
reminded
me
of
a
tropical
drink
in
some
ways
as
well
i
split
the
bottle
and
recommend
doing
the
same
one
glass
was
fantastic
but
anymore
i
think
the
spices
would
have
overpowered
my
senses
another
interesting
dogfish
head
beer
based
on
an
historical
golden
orangish
color
with
a
thin
white
head
lite
and
bubbely
mouthfeel
taste
is
very
strong
of
grapes
and
malt
has
a
sake
like
finish
it
is
going
down
very
easy
worthwhile
if
you
looking
for
a
slightly
sweet
beer
for
2
note
improved
some
on
warming
the
honey
taste
becomes
a
bit
more
complex
still
very
sweet
this
one
suffers
hard
on
the
drinkability
factor
it
just
isnt
worth
its
own
hype
i
paid
about
14
bucks
for
the
bottle
and
its
taste
does
not
seperate
it
from
other
more
inexpensive
beers
i
applaud
what
dogfish
is
doing
with
all
these
ancient
brews
but
by
todays
standards
this
is
nothing
special
worth
a
try
but
perhaps
this
recipe
should
have
stayed
in
the
tomb
just
kidding
i
admire
any
exploration
into
the
world
of
brewing
the
one
thing
that
i
really
appreciate
about
this
beer
is
the
origin
and
the
courage
it
takes
to
reproduce
a
beer
from
a
9000
yearold
recipe
that
alone
is
reason
to
try
this
brew
i
really
dont
think
these
dfh
brews
are
meant
to
be
drinkable
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
for
example
i
dont
think
any
group
freely
sharing
beers
would
need
to
open
two
of
these
you
get
a
sample
and
its
complex
enough
for
you
to
appreciate
it
sip
by
sip
still
this
is
the
only
one
ive
ever
had
and
im
eager
to
get
another
a
750ml
bottle
great
label
art
shared
with
psycohops
and
brothercannon
poured
into
a
trio
of
snifters
this
beer
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
rich
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
quickly
fading
off
white
foam
tastes
and
aroma
are
of
apples
white
red
and
purple
grapes
skin
and
all
honey
and
spicy
yeast
syrupy
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
works
well
here
rather
unique
and
certainly
worth
a
try
at
least
once
drinkability
it
is
extremely
tasty
i
could
have
finished
the
bottle
by
myself
but
its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
thanks
to
jj21
i
got
to
try
this
beer
a
little
to
sweet
to
session
but
i
drank
about
half
the
bottle
no
problem
i
poured
from
a
25
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
orange
with
a
minimal
fizzy
head
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
grapes
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
and
grapes
the
brew
is
light
bodied
ligfhtly
carbonated
with
an
bit
of
an
acidic
mouthfeel
for
me
the
beer
was
a
sipper
a
bit
too
sweet
the
brew
was
interesting
for
the
historical
aspects
but
it
was
not
for
me
poured
a
capped
750
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
honey
with
just
a
slight
white
head
leaving
no
lacing
if
head
was
just
a
slight
bit
more
pronounced
this
would
be
an
absolutely
beautiful
beer
the
aroma
is
great
honey
is
the
most
dominant
aroma
with
floral
notes
im
guessing
from
the
chrysanthemum
a
bit
of
toffee
and
just
a
slight
alcohol
burn
the
flavor
is
amazing
this
in
my
mind
is
my
favorite
beer
that
dogfish
head
makes
the
flavor
is
huge
wild
honey
flowers
and
muscat
grapes
with
just
a
hint
of
the
8
alcohol
it
all
blends
beautifully
together
magnificent
the
honey
hits
the
palate
on
full
blast
slowly
running
through
all
the
other
flavors
but
never
letting
your
tongue
slip
from
that
initial
blast
of
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
much
fuller
and
creamier
then
i
would
have
expected
of
all
the
crazy
off
centered
beers
that
dogfish
head
makes
this
is
the
first
one
then
i
have
had
that
really
hit
its
mark
drinkability
a
little
much
on
the
fruit
and
spice
high
abv
make
this
a
tough
one
to
down
i
think
one
bombers
enough
i
rate
this
as
highly
drinkable
smooth
good
flavor
and
a
very
well
masked
abv
worth
whatever
outrageous
price
i
paid
for
it
drinkablity
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
obviously
extremely
interesting
to
try
but
not
what
i
would
consider
as
a
go
to
beer
worth
a
try
just
to
experience
something
different
light
and
crisp
enough
to
be
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
warmer
evening
very
good
balance
doesnt
hurt
either
pour
is
light
orangishblonde
with
a
white
head
that
settles
quickly
tastes
like
a
mix
between
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
muscat
wine
again
they
mentioned
muscat
in
the
ingredients
used
tastes
a
bit
like
a
fruitier
version
of
midas
touch
is
a
tad
bit
acrid
especially
in
aftertaste
though
there
isnt
much
aftertaste
like
a
dry
champagne
the
mouth
is
light
but
not
thin
and
is
again
similar
to
a
belgian
pale
overall
its
very
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
and
light
all
around
as
in
i
could
see
drinking
it
in
summer
time
its
sweet
but
not
syrupy
and
not
too
estery
either
not
mindblowing
but
very
good
d
the
sweetness
overpowers
a
bit
and
as
a
result
the
taste
and
drinkability
suffer
however
if
you
are
a
white
wine
lover
who
also
enjoys
beer
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
i
appreciate
the
research
that
went
into
this
brew
the
backstory
is
great
the
end
result
not
so
great
pours
a
golden
light
yellow
cloudy
colored
body
with
some
smallish
white
head
and
small
bubbles
has
a
light
floral
malty
aroma
with
some
grapes
and
alcohol
a
nice
floral
taste
with
sweet
grape
and
malts
has
an
interesting
flavor
edit
the
date
on
the
bottle
was
07
making
this
beer
over
a
year
old
it
is
bottle
conditioned
but
since
ive
only
had
this
one
bottle
i
dont
know
how
aging
might
have
changed
it
overall
very
pleased
with
this
brew
d
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
very
good
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
as
i
noted
above
this
beer
was
aged
for
two
years
and
turned
out
the
be
very
nice
and
smooth
a
good
beer
overall
even
after
a
few
years
of
aging
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
active
head
fizzy
carbonation
sour
malty
aroma
taste
is
bitter
sweetness
some
honey
notes
a
little
sour
overly
carbonated
points
for
a
unique
idea
but
not
a
great
beer
dfh
could
do
better
very
much
worth
the
18
dollar
price
i
paid
for
it
at
the
cork
keg
in
salem
va
and
will
go
there
again
and
get
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
disappears
and
leaves
no
lacing
and
only
sparse
bubbles
that
cling
to
the
sides
some
floaties
in
the
glass
maybe
some
yeast
or
protein
coagulation
smell
is
really
interesting
lots
of
pear
and
grape
notes
of
honey
quite
intriguing
taste
is
somewhat
tart
and
then
finishes
in
a
white
grape
taste
some
residual
sweetness
lingers
on
the
tongue
seems
like
more
carbonation
would
benefit
this
beer
as
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
to
carry
the
alcohol
effectively
definitely
an
interesting
beer
but
one
that
might
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
down
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
a
very
different
beer
from
anything
else
ive
had
pours
cloudy
gold
with
almost
no
head
and
no
carbonation
honey
muscat
grapes
and
earthiness
in
the
nose
drinks
like
a
liquerport
lots
of
honey
and
grapes
solid
malt
back
anmd
a
dirtyvegetablefruit
flavor
throughout
interesting
break
from
normal
beers
but
not
a
regular
in
the
rotation
i
have
conspicuously
avoided
spiced
and
flavored
beers
but
the
success
of
this
tasting
has
opened
a
new
door
of
experimentation
that
i
must
enter
i
fear
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lacing
aroma
of
honey
grape
apple
pear
as
well
as
a
strong
alcohol
presence
very
sweet
with
lots
of
honey
grape
and
apple
up
front
also
hints
of
citrusy
orange
and
alcohol
although
it
is
quite
sweet
the
slight
maltiness
gives
it
a
nice
balance
preventing
it
from
becoming
too
tart
very
refreshing
the
aroma
is
floral
sweet
buttery
and
spicy
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
thin
white
head
the
taste
is
complex
mix
of
grapes
honey
butter
and
rice
sweet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
sweet
and
yet
a
spicy
ending
on
the
palate
as
if
from
hops
but
maybe
from
added
spices
relatively
thick
oily
mouthfeel
i
love
these
traditional
or
historic
ales
and
i
actively
seek
them
out
my
rating
generally
reflects
this
love
of
ancient
beer
recreations
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sharing
beer
to
bust
out
with
some
friends
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
finish
a
bottle
of
this
by
myself
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mellow
carbonation
the
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
refreshing
overall
apart
from
being
a
tad
too
sweet
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
the
fact
that
it
is
recreated
from
an
ancient
recipe
is
pretty
cool
as
well
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
this
was
an
interesting
experience
that
i
liked
but
not
one
that
i
care
to
repeat
any
time
soon
hard
to
find
in
socal
but
id
buy
again
quality
is
it
drinkable
yeah
i
guess
so
jiahu
is
frankly
a
must
try
for
lovers
of
extreme
different
or
just
flatout
interesting
beer
because
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
one
of
sams
crazy
ideas
that
works
this
stuff
is
meh
had
it
on
bottle
down
in
ocean
city
md
one
night
after
buying
it
at
a
singles
shop
poured
it
into
a
tankard
chunks
of
little
stuff
floating
in
the
beer
grape
chunks
i
dunno
sweet
but
very
strong
taste
tastsed
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
definitely
not
a
chugger
this
beer
is
yet
again
another
mindblowinghowdidtheydoit
what
labourous
research
went
into
this
recreation
it
is
really
amazing
to
think
of
drinking
the
same
beverage
as
people
9000
years
ago
in
the
ancient
middle
east
depite
being
extremly
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
an
example
of
mr
calagiones
extreme
level
of
talent
and
ingenuity
he
applies
to
his
craft
drinkability
i
like
juice
and
this
is
amazing
for
something
to
have
with
breakfast
in
place
of
orange
or
some
other
juice
i
love
it
what
can
i
say
somewhat
sweet
nose
crystalized
fruits
banana
smooth
texture
light
carbination
somewhat
like
a
midas
touch
toned
down
sweet
and
funk
though
this
beer
can
age
best
shared
with
friends
an
interesting
brew
and
not
a
lot
of
others
that
are
even
somewhat
similar
hats
off
for
that
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
but
good
marks
for
how
different
it
is
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
does
have
a
lot
of
chardonnay
character
to
it
but
still
retained
some
beer
qualities
to
it
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
at
9abv
which
is
what
was
printed
on
the
bottle
cheers

a
great

an
intriguing

by
a
pioneering

seemlessly
poured
golden
drink
into
a
tulip
glass
which
supported
the
very
small
white
head
for
about
a
half
minute
low
clarity
smells
overtly
of
grapes
fairly
light
body
fizzes
with
grapes
on
the
tongue
leaving
a
distinct
taste
unknown
to
me
maybe
it
is
the
hawthorn
fruit
this
after
taste
slightly
bitter
and
acidic
lingers
and
encourages
frequent
sips
the
alcohol
warmth
is
mild
mostly
in
my
throat
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
expecting
something
sweeter
though
it
is
sweet
it
is
mild
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
glasses
a
unique
beer
worth
a
try
i
just
wonder
how
close
dogfish
head
got
the
recipe
id
like
to
think
its
the
same
as
it
was
9000
years
ago
very
unique
beer

minimal

feel
to

but
i
ouldnt
call
it
an
old
ale
more
interesting
than
good
not
bad
at
all
but
not
worth
the
price
a
wonderful
beer
many
thanks
to
dfh
for
making
this
this
was
a
unique
brew
from
dogfish
head
i
enjoyed
it
chilled
in
my
duvel
bubbler
poured
a
light
golden
color
smelled
of
honey
and
tart
white
grapes
couldnt
really
detect
the
rice
though
the
taste
was
good
i
noticed
the
muscat
grapes
because
i
have
had
muscat
wine
before
there
was
a
hint
of
honey
and
a
slight
tartness
in
the
finish
overall
pretty
unique
but
no
where
near
dfh
best
offering
it
has
a
light
mead
type
character
which
is
nice
its
a
sipper
that
should
be
consumed
in
small
quantites
i
would
have
probably
rated
it
a
bit
higher
in
taste
had
the
metallic
taste
not
been
there
the
combination
of
sweet
and
metallic
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
was
served
to
me
with
no
head
very
little
carbonation
a
flat
gleaming
thick
orange
smells
of
fruit
melons
apricot
apple
the
first
sip
immediately
hit
me
as
apple
juice
but
via
further
tastes
i
really
got
a
lot
of
honey
apple
and
floral
notes
out
of
it
along
with
just
enough
of
a
feeling
of
alcohol
to
remind
you
youre
not
just
drinking
apple
juice
if
maybe
a
little
weak
mouthfeel
is
a
light
to
medium
body
very
refreshing
and
nice
for
springsummer
id
probably
have
another
one
of
these
but
the
dominance
of
honey
and
fruit
flavors
doesnt
really
make
me
think
im
drinking
a
beer
more
like
some
exotic
mellow
wine
very
interesting
though
im
impressed
with
the
label
without
even
trying
the
beer
yet
nice
attractive
topless
woman
with
a
beer
in
hand
what
more
could
you
ask
for
but
back
to
the
task
at
hand
the
first
pour
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
produced
a
moderate
amount
of
head
and
had
an
aroma
of
white
grape
juice
nice
light
golden
orange
color
to
it
that
was
very
clear
and
could
see
the
carbonation
thru
it
when
it
touched
my
lips
i
got
hints
of
honey
and
at
some
points
in
time
i
got
a
budweiser
kind
of
taste
which
might
have
been
due
to
the
rice
that
was
used
in
the
brewing
the
second
pour
yielded
a
very
fine
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
the
color
looked
different
and
had
more
of
a
translucent
orange
look
not
as
crystal
clear
as
the
first
pour
taste
changed
a
little
too
and
i
got
some
sort
of
spice
to
it
but
i
cannot
describe
it
only
that
it
left
sort
of
a
powdery
feel
in
my
mouth
as
i
was
drinking
this
one
it
was
interesting
to
think
that
thousands
of
years
ago
someone
could
have
been
enjoying
a
similar
drink
once
again
i
am
impressed
with
the
unique
brews
that
dogfish
head
comes
up
with
never
been
disappointed
yet
overall
a
fine
brew
drinkability
is
fair
this
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
mead
and
a
cider
with
the
focus
on
honey
and
fruits
interesting
in
small
doses
better
suited
for
afterdinner
sipping
than
social
drinking
an
experimental
brew
that
is
unique
and
tasty
this
is
one
to
have
if
in
the
mood
for
something
different
and
candyish
cloudy
orange
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
head
smell
is
corn
and
rice
like
malty
sweetness
with
notes
of
grapes
as
well
taste
is
fairly
sweet
notes
of
corn
rice
again
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
grape
too
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
sweet
beyond
that
in
the
aftertaste
interesting
but
slightly
cloying
and
very
lagery
corn
like
good
for
sharing
but
probably
not
in
large
amounts
d
its
good
you
would
have
to
adjust
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
to
become
accustomed
to
this
md
smooth
and
light
like
iced
tea
but
not
beer
as
an
archaeologist
i
fully
appreciate
what
dogfish
is
doing
here
and
any
attempt
at
historifal
recreationadaptation
cant
wait
until
the
aztec
cocoa
beer
theyre
coming
out
with
aggressive
pour
barely
gives
a
head
what
it
does
give
goes
away
within
minutes
lacing
is
non
existent
color
is
light
orangish
small
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
smell
is
amazing
fruity
honey
spices
taste
is
sweet
and
then
bitter
as
it
goes
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
but
not
overly
slightly
carbonated
on
the
tongue
after
taste
is
a
little
warm
im
having
no
problems
finishing
the
bottle
a
tasty
beverage
fo
shizzle
note
were
there
muscat
grapes
in
late
neolithic
china
d
i
dont
think
id
go
for
another
but
id
finish
this
one
its
not
something
that
amazed
me
so
much
i
want
to
come
back
to
it
but
it
was
definitely
interesting
and
tasty
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
good
beer
good
flavor
but
can
only
enjoy
a
little
bit
cant
drink
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
too
sweet
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
head
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
a
fruit
smell
is
noticeable
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
meads
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
seems
to
be
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
although
it
does
seem
a
bit
under
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer

but
it
tastes
more
like
a
wine
or
mead
than
a
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
clear
bright
gold
with
a
head
that
builds
up
well
but
falls
very
fast
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
the
aroma
is
until
i
just
learned
there
is
chrysanthemum
in
it
and
thats
what
i
would
describe
it
as
mildly
flowery
as
it
warms
i
sense
some
fruit
maybe
the
grapes
coming
through
the
taste
is
a
bit
floral
and
very
earthy
maybe
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
fruit
overall
the
earthiness
dominates
lighter
mouthfeel
but
the
texture
is
pretty
smooth
and
interesting
flavor
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
a
whole
lot
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
most
gentle
easy
seafoaminess
registers
nicely
on
the
scale
i
would
love
to
have
had
more
texture
though
this
is
very
good
but
it
simply
doesnt
fashion
well
by
itself
a
fresh
crunchy
vegetable
crudité
with
ranch
dressing
would
be
perfect
though
d
again
because
it
was
so
sweet
i
consider
this
an
after
dinner
beer
or
a
dessert
beer
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
again
just
too
sweet
d
an
interesting
beer
historically
and
tastewise
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
although
750mls
was
kind
of
a
lot
at
the
end
of
the
night
a
good
beer
to
crack
open
with
a
friend
and
watch
the
history
channel
drinkability
again
has
to
be
compared
to
a
nice
sweet
white
wine
which
in
my
book
is
high
beer
wine
mead
doesnt
matter
its
a
fine
drink
for
special
occasions
such
as
new
years
day
pours
a
thickly
clouded
gold
that
gives
a
small
amount
of
white
head
off
a
very
aggressive
pour
nose
is
like
sugar
fruit
mild
honey
and
grapes
flavor
is
really
odd
and
unique
sweet
tangy
definite
muscat
grapes
there
heavily
influence
a
lot
of
the
flavor
and
feel
speaking
of
feel
it
is
thick
with
a
syrupy
attribute
falls
off
on
the
edge
and
leaves
a
watery
ending
feel
but
with
a
somewhat
lasting
syrup
edge
on
the
tongue
definitely
drinkable
might
be
a
bit
too
unique
for
a
few
but
overall
definitely
worth
taking
a
shot
at
bottled
82806
kept
in
my
cellar
since
jan
07
pours
a
brilliant
orangeamber
but
hazy
little
head
no
lace
the
orange
character
is
almost
neon
aroma
is
honey
and
hawthorn
with
hints
of
orange
peel
no
hop
aroma
some
slight
mustyyeasty
character
flavor
is
honey
and
hawthorn
again
with
more
orange
peel
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
champagne
flavor
perhaps
from
the
muscat
grapes
overall
it
comes
across
very
balanced
and
complex
sweet
upfront
fading
into
a
pleasant
tartness
body
is
medium
to
full
tail
is
all
balance
with
both
the
sweetness
and
tartness
lingering
and
pleading
for
more
poured
into
my
dfh
glass
a
nice
semihazy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
fizzy
little
white
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
yeasty
some
spices
honey
hawthrowne
berries
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
maltyyeasty
nice
little
touch
of
spicyness
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
a
different
brew
for
me
recommended
drinkability
another
quality
brew
from
dogfish
great
melding
flavors
and
great
texture
think
im
going
to
buy
another
to
take
back
home
with
me
overall
this
was
quite
unique
something
that
was
very
much
different
then
most
other
things
i
had
tried
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
oldness
to
it
kind
of
weird
having
something
that
has
been
consumed
in
one
form
for
thousands
of
years
but
it
works
very
well
lots
of
honey
and
rice
and
a
good
deal
of
sediment
this
was
something
i
would
try
again
with
no
issue
it
was
definitely
interesting
and
was
worth
the
price
drinkability
a
nice
relaxing
beer
to
share
with
someone
and
hold
a
conversation
about
it
drinkability
i
often
feel
in
danger
of
seeming
as
though
ill
drink
anything
but
then
i
reconsider
and
decide
that
enjoying
most
things
i
drink
merely
shows
what
a
discerning
buyer
i
am
i
had
my
doubts
going
in
as
to
whether
this
beer
would
even
manage
average
drinkability
and
my
fears
were
soon
put
to
rest
while
i
wouldnt
necessarily
drink
this
every
day
this
is
a
solidly
enjoyable
beerlike
beverage
that
manages
to
integrate
the
disparate
ingredients
exceedingly
well
its
also
a
perfect
crossover
beverage
with
aspects
that
appeal
to
both
the
wine
aficionado
and
the
beer
geek
as
well
as
your
weird
friend
who
loves
all
things
asian
and
wishes
that
he
were
a
giant
robot
with
breastsyou
know
the
one
im
talking
about
d
not
sure
what
to
say
i
guess
i
would
drink
it
again
it
might
be
a
good
choice
for
a
snowy
afternoon
just
hanging
out
watching
it
come
down
with
a
fire
going
on
the
other
hand
its
hard
to
imagine
drinking
it
often
and
certainly
is
only
good
in
small
quantities
on
the
other
hand
i
only
drank
about
half
the
bottle
and
couldnt
bring
myself
to
drink
the
rest
d
hard
to
get
higher
abv
would
still
love
to
cellar
this
beer
and
try
it
over
the
next
few
holiday
dinners
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
you
like
a
range
of
beers
or
are
open
to
a
beer
with
very
unbeer
characteristics
while
dogfish
head
gets
their
share
of
naysayers
i
generally
like
the
innovative
spirit
of
the
company
this
is
another
interesting
selection
which
like
most
of
their
stuff
has
its
place
on
my
palate
when
looking
im
looking
for
something
beyond
a
well
crafted
selection
of
a
specific
style
oh
and
for
those
who
dont
like
drinking
sediment
simply
dont
shake
up
the
bottle
too
much
and
dont
drain
it
down
to
the
bottom
i
suppose
you
could
also
decant
it
down
so
anyway
pretty
tasty
and
a
pretty
awesome
concept
in
both
brewing
and
historical
terms
flowing
like
the
waters
of
yangtze
before
the
three
gorges
dam
it
fills
the
glass
with
a
slightly
hazy
orange
the
head
a
huge
pile
of
frothy
white
which
erodes
slowly
the
resultant
lacing
a
complete
coat
to
hide
the
glass
nose
a
phenomenal
blend
of
aromas
honey
grapes
barley
rice
hawthorn
fruit
chrysanthemum
flowers
yeast
what
a
lineup
and
they
all
blend
perfectly
ambrosial
start
with
a
twang
at
the
back
top
feels
moderate
to
the
palate
finish
is
modestly
acidic
sweet
flowery
and
dry
aftertaste
nails
itself
to
the
taste
buds
what
a
brew
what
a
marvelous
concoction
of
grains
flowers
and
fruit
a
true
one
of
a
kind
masterpiece
of
the
brewers
art
drinkability
this
is
a
good
ale
its
abv
limits
sessionability
and
also
this
would
seem
to
be
something
to
go
with
dinner
andor
dessert
rather
than
serve
as
a
session
beer
750
ml
bottle
bottled
on
71007
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
clear
gold
with
a
half
inch
white
head
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
it
smells
like
honey
grain
apricots
and
grapes
theres
also
an
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
budweiser
for
some
reason
not
in
a
bad
way
i
cant
exactly
explain
it
taste
is
fruity
and
sweet
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
except
theres
a
bit
of
a
spicy
and
floral
taste
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
feel
drinkability
is
ok
alcohol
is
noticable
but
its
not
overpowering
its
another
unique
brew
from
dogfish
head
thats
for
sure
id
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
drink
this
again
but
i
would
revisit
this
in
the
future
cheers
to
sam
and
everyone
at
dfh
for
a
job
well
done
on
this
one
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
this
strange
fluid
pours
a
medium
yellow
color
with
highlights
of
light
honey
active
carbonation
bubbles
soar
to
the
surface
of
the
liquid
in
the
large
white
wine
glass
im
using
to
review
this
beer
the
rather
thin
head
is
tight
and
quite
sticky
leaving
spots
of
lacing
inside
the
glassware
the
nose
is
quite
simply
otherworldly

is
this
beer
or
possibly
a
complex
white
wine
the
muscat
grapes
used
in
this
beer
are
present
right
from
the
start
and
lend
a
very
unusual
winelike
bouquet
to
the
nose
making
you
think
you
might
be
drinking
a
sparkling
white
wine
instead
of
a
technically
beer
slightly
sweet
on
the
nose
as
well
the
wildflower
honey
is
evident
and
makes
one
think
a
bit
of
a
mead
this
is
either
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ever
or
it
has
a
serious
identity
crisis
slight
floral
notes
which
i
can
only
assume
is
from
the
chrysanthemum
are
very
inviting
as
well
the
nose
is
quite
honestly
more
like
a
wine
or
a
mead
than
a
beer
on
first
blush
the
palate
does
not
pale
in
comparison
to
the
nose
but
grants
a
fuller
picture
of
what
the
nose
only
hints
at
again
a
sparkling
white
wine
comes
to
mind
but
the
mouth
feel
is
obviously
thicker
and
the
initial
flavor
substantially
sweeter
the
sweetness
subsides
a
little
bit
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
mouth
and
yields
to
a
spicier
fruitier
composition
that
reminds
me
of
a
good
belgian
tripel
without
a
doubt
though
the
honey
and
the
grapes
are
dominant
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
moderately
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
just
adequate
to
keep
this
beer
from
being
sticky
and
cloying
in
a
nutshell
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
all
at
once
im
a
little
bit
torn
whether
it
all
melds
together
masterfully
or
its
just
a
little
outside
the
realm
of
congruence
whatever
your
take
is
however
this
is
clearly
a
wellcrafted
and
seriously
complex
beer
that
defies
style
and
stretches
the
palate
in
a
very
good
way
i
think
if
you
really
like
a
belgian
tripel
or
maybe
even
a
saison
youll
at
least
appreciate
this
beer
for
me
i
genuinely
like
it
and
would
like
to
revisit
it
again
like
anything
new
a
beer
that
is
this
unique
takes
some
getting
used
to
dogfish
head
does
it
again
i
bought
this
beer
with
no
expectations
having
tasted
it
i
dont
quite
no
what
to
make
of
it
i
like
it
but
i
cant
quite
recommend
it
the
closest
parallel
i
can
make
to
it
is
9
tasty
sweet
but
not
an
over
the
top
fruity
beer
this
is
unarguably
a
more
serious
beer
than
9
but
its
not
ubiquitous
or
cheap
like
9
so
the
comparison
is
unfair
i
might
need
to
experiment
by
feeding
this
to
a
more
feminine
palate
overall
i
like
the
extremely
old
school
beers
that
dogfish
has
been
brewing
lately
while
most
of
their
modern
stuff
strikes
me
as
merely
ok
both
midas
and
this
jiahu
have
hit
a
sweet
spot
with
me
literally
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
full
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
lightness
interesting
tastemore
of
a
sippergoes
down
easynot
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
seems
like
a
good
beer
to
age
with
the
winelike
feel
throughout
beer
pours
out
a
dark
golden
color
not
too
far
off
from
some
macro
lagers
gives
a
very
small
head
with
a
small
ring
of
lacing
smell
was
mild
some
light
malt
and
rice
with
honey
seeming
to
come
through
in
both
smell
and
taste
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
full
of
that
honey
and
some
spices
mouthfeel
somewhat
syrupy
to
me
all
in
all
above
average
but
not
great
pours
a
hazy
apricotorange
with
numerous
slowmoving
bubbles
distributed
evenly
throughout
the
glass
making
their
way
to
the
thin
ring
of
lace
that
sits
atop
the
beer
aroma
has
a
very
clean
rice
beer
aroma
along
with
some
mild
graininess
and
medicinal
qualities
i
pick
up
some
honey
and
pholics
along
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
starts
off
with
a
punch
of
cloying
sweetness
and
fermented
rice
flavors
think
bud
in
the
middle
comes
a
mild
yet
bright
tartness
along
with
some
floral
notes
and
some
fruitiness
that
does
not
taste
as
if
derived
from
fermentation
byproducts
finishes
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
a
return
of
the
somewhat
heavy
phenlic
edge
aftertaste
is
rather
sugary
in
spite
of
the
relatively
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
sticky
and
jagged
with
concerns
to
the
carbonation
overall
i
enjoy
this
in
a
way
but
honestly
this
reminds
me
of
a
boozier
budweiser
with
a
touch
of
cloying
sweetness
a
mild
tart
presence
and
some
odd
phenolics
and
an
overthetop
price
tag
impressed
i
am
more
so
by
the
idea
rather
than
the
execution
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
fruity
scent
that
smells
of
grapes
and
honey
im
not
sure
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
aroma
but
whatever
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
wine
taste
to
it
there
are
flavors
of
honey
and
fruit
with
a
bland
grape
juice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
im
really
not
impressed
with
dogfish
heads
new
brew
additions
i
guess
theyre
cool
and
innovative
but
im
totally
uninterested
i
dig
the
historical
research
behind
this
and
actually
dig
the
reinterpretation
quite
a
bit
too
i
never
much
cared
for
their
other
foray
into
the
past
midas
touch
but
id
do
this
again
the
numbers
ive
assigned
are
more
or
less
meaningless
because
it
is
incomparable
to
anything
a
mood
beverage
for
sure
but
i
think
it
was
pulled
off
well
a
very
nice
offering
i
will
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
while
this
batch
is
available

overall
very
cool
to
be
drinking
a
9000
year
old
recipein
fact
its
one
of
the
reasons
i
want
to
homebrew
more
is
to
do
historic
recipes
while
this
is
interesting
and
nice
it
doesnt
tickle
my
fancy
that
much
good
but
not
something
ill
buy
again
in
spite
of
my
love
and
respect
for
dogfish
to
make
beer
like
thisthough
i
did
buy
this
one
12
bottle
in
the
name
of
the
cause
nor
can
i
say
i
was
disappointedjust
not
overwhelmed
and
expect
it
was
a
tremendous
ale
9
millenia
ago
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
shallow
wispy
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
fairly
rapidly
very
light
lacing
the
smell
is
kind
of
nice
i
get
honey
and
grapes
mostly
with
a
little
apple
and
spice
light
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
mild
and
creamy
yet
adequately
carbonated
the
flavor
is
soft
sweet
and
fruity
a
little
apple
lightly
spiced
a
little
like
a
mellow
applepear
marainge
finishes
with
a
lingering
orchard
fruitiness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
a
warmer
on
the
way
down
enjoyable
kudos
scores
points
for
imagination
i
am
definitely
going
to
snag
another
or
so
pours
a
pale
orangeish
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
honey
spices
and
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
honey
is
quite
predominate
and
a
lemon
citrus
charicteristic
a
clean
mouthfeel
with
an
aftertaste
of
honey
and
a
small
presence
of
something
like
medicinal
i
liked
the
dry
honey
taste
easy
to
drink
and
quite
different
pours
a
nice
reddish
orange
quite
cloudy
very
little
head
and
no
real
lacing
but
hey
who
knows
what
beer
looked
like
way
back
when
for
now
im
not
complaining
the
smell
is
fruity
with
orange
something
berrylikeand
a
waxiness
and
earthiness
from
the
rice
the
taste
is
smooth
complicated
and
interesting
an
underlying
red
rice
flavor
seems
evident
similar
to
a
red
rice
saki
waxy
and
earthy
notes
there
are
also
substantial
honey
flavors
so
there
is
a
meadlike
feel
as
well
some
slight
astringent
notes
from
the
hawthorne
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
very
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
i
also
love
the
archaelogical
beer
project
lets
keep
them
coming
d
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
i
just
love
it
overall
i
guess
if
you
arent
in
the
mood
for
a
light
sweet
refreshing
drink
then
this
isnt
the
best
choice
but
on
a
friday
after
a
hot
work
day
this
was
perfect
for
me
overall
a
tasty
and
very
interesting
brew
imo
better
than
midas
touch
though
along
the
same
lines
recommended
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
but
my
hopes
werent
so
high
for
it
because
im
not
really
big
on
fruity
spicy
beers
it
poured
a
cool
cloudy
november
orange
with
no
head
at
all
there
was
a
lot
of
suspended
yeast
and
some
precipitate
as
well
smell
was
spicy
and
fruity
a
lot
like
cider
with
notes
of
herbaceous
plants
it
tasted
a
lot
like
a
hard
cider
to
me
the
grapes
were
noticeable
and
so
was
the
honeylent
sweetness
it
was
light
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
though
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
wasnt
very
prevalent
the
feeling
of
it
was
there
i
wasnt
nuts
about
this
one
and
wouldnt
be
inclined
to
drink
more
than
the
pint
i
had
when
i
shared
the
bottle
of
this
with
my
dad
not
a
bad
oneoff
though
it
wasnt
for
me
but
other
people
might
be
more
inclined
to
like
it
drinkability
very
high
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
combined
with
the
midrange
alcohol
make
this
very
easy
and
very
tasty
to
drink
a
very
worthwhile
addition
to
dogfishs
lineup
this
year
highly
recommended
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
clear
goldenamber
with
a
hint
of
orange
aroma
is
crisp
and
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
and
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
is
hoppy
crisp
and
edgy
with
some
malt
element
and
a
strong
orange
hint
rather
different
from
other
beers
i
have
tried
perhaps
because
the
recipe
is
supposed
to
be
9000
years
old
it
is
smooth
with
just
a
little
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
orange
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
usually
i
like
dogfish
head
beers
but
this
one
was
a
little
diffrent
the
wife
and
i
bought
it
along
with
some
other
beers
at
wells
in
towson
and
drank
it
last
night
right
after
the
pour
there
was
a
ton
of
floaties
in
there
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
it
was
nothing
like
this
one
i
remember
dogfish
saying
there
were
really
into
quality
control
but
i
guess
they
missed
one
i
still
drank
it
though
as
it
tasted
ok
smell
was
probably
the
best
thing
about
it
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
one
again
i
guess
based
on
the
uniqueness
alone
id
weakly
recommend
it
another
good
beer
from
dogfish
head
this
is
not
a
drinking
mans
beer
there
is
a
lot
unusual
flavor
to
this
offering
with
an
open
mind
this
can
be
a
great
beer
to
test
that
said
it
isnt
my
style
as
i
prefer
more
hoppy
beers
but
im
glad
i
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
d
very
good
i
usually
dont
like
such
sweet
beveriges
but
this
does
the
trick
on
a
hot
day
d
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
from
time
to
time
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
time
to
time
750ml
bottle
mine
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
fizziness
but
no
head
to
speak
of
and
what
was
there
was
gone
almost
instantly
the
color
is
a
cloudy
orange
hued
dark
golden
the
aroma
is
nice
hints
of
spices
and
slightly
orange
to
the
nose
maybe
pears
and
honey
too
somewhat
sweet
with
notes
of
pears
and
honey
to
the
taste
also
some
spiciness
this
is
really
good
it
is
interesting
that
someone
may
have
been
sipping
a
similar
concoction
9000
years
ago
another
fine
and
creative
beer
from
a
great
brewery
bottle
courtesy
of
plucier
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
ale
with
a
nice
white
head
with
average
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
malt
is
weak
with
some
sweetness
probably
coming
from
honey
taste
is
quit
sweet
with
honey
dominating
and
some
light
spices
also
noticeable
body
is
about
average
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
noticeable
overall
i
thought
this
lack
complexity
and
was
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
palate
definitely
not
the
best
from
this
great
brewery
pours
a
cloudy
lemony
color
mine
had
more
than
a
few
suspended
particles
and
a
minimal
head
faintly
floral
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
nice
crisp
pearpineapple
with
a
good
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
felt
in
a
nice
way
with
a
gentle
warming
at
the
end
and
just
a
hint
of
burn
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
drinkability
thanks
but
no
thanks
so
far
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
these
residue
beers
considering
how
bizarre
this
is
the
relative
sweetness
and
the
fact
that
it
is
80abv
i
feel
that
this
is
rather
drinkable
and
have
no
problem
at
all
finishing
a
750ml
by
myself
certainly
one
of
the
better
strange
or
specialty
offerings
from
dfh
imo
not
something
id
want
to
drink
often
or
even
a
whole
bottle
of
but
not
bad
and
worth
trying
a
very
easy
and
interesting
beer
to
drink
a
bit
of
novelty
not
sure
if
id
pay
the
steep
price
they
charge
for
this
but
more
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
brewing
these
creative
beers
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
i
think
i
would
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
this
brew
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
as
stated
previously
stated
i
want
more
this
750
ml
bottle
passed
very
quickly
thanks
dfh
for
yet
one
more
envelope
pushing
beer
drinkability
i
approached
this
with
some
trepidation
as
dogfish
head
has
been
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
this
one
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
wellblended
with
tremendous
complexity
thanks
to
crwills
for
this
treat
i
never
know
what
to
expect
from
one
of
dogfish
head
craft
brewerys
experimental
ales
midas
touch
to
use
but
one
example
was
less
than
compelling
chateau
jihau
is
another
matter
entirely
it
has
an
interesting
back
story
and
is
much
more
importantly
delicious
beer
it
probably
doesnt
much
resemble
what
the
chinese
were
drinking
9000
years
ago
but
its
fun
to
pretend
i
have
no
regrets
about
spending
8
99
for
the
bottle
i
would
recommend
letting
this
sit
before
drinking
this
was
an
interesting
experiment
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
i
feel
no
need
to
come
back
this
is
one
unique
brew
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
but
interesting
none
the
less
drinkability
surprisingly
good
for
such
a
strange
beer
the
story
is
a
plus
too
this
is
not
much
unlike
some
belgian
brews
being
produced
today
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
goes
down
easily
as
it
is
less
harsh
and
dry
than
a
white
wine
dfh
seems
to
specialize
in
these
winelike
brews
to
awesome
effect
this
is
another
one
that
has
the
potential
to
show
wine
drinkers
exactly
what
beer
can
do
pricey
yes
but
you
should
try
this
at
least
once
if
you
can
find
it
honeysweet
enough
to
be
flawlessly
drinkable
but
yeasty
enough
to
not
be
cloying
you
could
seriously
build
a
civilization
around
this
beer
a
must
try
overall
thanks
go
out
to
ggaughan
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
thanks
again
for
a
great
trade
opinion
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
it
comes
across
to
me
a
bit
like
their
midas
touch
in
that
it
seems
to
be
as
much
of
a
carbonated
wine
as
a
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
in
this
beer
and
the
spices
dont
balance
it
but
challenge
it
i
like
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
how
it
is
difficult
to
pick
out
any
one
thing
in
particular
this
is
a
pretty
good
drink
but
i
cant
imagine
that
i
will
be
making
a
habit
out
of
drinking
this
i
think
that
regarding
these
winebeers
i
like
the
midas
better
still
keep
it
up
sam
poured
a
hazy
yellow
much
like
a
hefeweizen
or
an
apple
cider
little
head
to
speak
of
smells
of
grapes
and
honey
pears
perhaps
of
licorice
as
well
taste
is
sweet
but
not
sweetened
if
that
makes
sense
has
a
bit
of
rice
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
mellow
a
bit
dry
perhaps
as
a
result
of
using
the
sake
yeast
overall
a
nice
and
unusual
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
but
some
others
may
be
put
off
by
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
else
i
can
think
of
quite
different
from
the
other
dfh
brews
chateau
jiahu
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
25
6
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
grape
the
taste
is
also
of
grapes
with
a
beery
aftertaste
definitely
kind
of
an
odd
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
drinkability
pricy
but
interesting
a
good
pick
for
a
tasting
of
unique
beers
very
interesting
ill
admit
im
always
intrigued
by
the
dfh
archaeological
endeavors
but
they
dont
always
translate
to
the
current
day
this
time
though
the
result
is
a
brew
that
if
accurate
would
seem
to
be
as
enjoyable
today
as
it
was
way
back
when
in
china
the
aroma
was
too
busy
and
id
call
it
the
only
real
offnote
and
while
the
abv
is
typically
dogfishobvious
its
not
so
big
that
it
limits
unduly
i
finished
the
one
bottle
willingly
and
while
a
second
might
be
pushing
it
id
drain
another
any
time
i
found
it
in
front
of
me
hey
maybe
they
could
market
this
in
china
and
sam
could
tap
into
the
biggest
potential
beer
market
on
the
planet
d
delicious
beer
but
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
disneyland
good
place
to
visit
but
you
dont
want
to
be
there
every
day
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
but
it
comes
with
the
territory
i
salute
dogfish
head
for
unarchiving
these
recipes
and
i
appreciate
these
beers
certainly
a
unique
concoction
that
defies
the
boundaries
of
style
pleasant
for
the
novelty
but
not
an
ale
that
id
go
back
to
props
to
dfh
for
keeping
the
8
abv
almost
completely
hidden
chateau
jiahu
poured
a
light
cloudy
amber
with
good
head
development
despite
what
appeared
to
be
lazy
carbonation
in
the
glass
aroma
was
fruity
and
alcoholic
with
both
sour
and
sweet
notes
neither
of
which
were
overpowering
pleasant
smell
overall
very
similar
to
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
taste
was
sweet
and
somewhat
winelike
this
beer
has
a
very
mellow
fruitiness
to
it
not
what
i
would
typically
drink
but
good
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
with
well
developed
carbonation
despite
my
earlier
visual
observations
moderate
to
high
alcohol
content
lends
to
a
warming
sensation
not
bad
for
an
herbedspiced
beer
although
i
prefer
midas
touch
over
this
recipe
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
806
laser
printed
on
the
neck
the
label
was
really
neat
and
featured
a
chinese
woman
with
a
tatoo
on
her
lower
back
tasteful
unlike
most
of
the
crap
you
see
out
there
it
had
a
nice
golden
honey
color
with
a
bit
of
orange
slightly
hazy
it
had
about
half
a
finger
of
head
and
a
ton
of
initial
carb
both
settled
down
quickly
the
smell
was
a
strong
fruity
smell
dominated
by
grapes
there
was
also
a
good
spicy
kick
in
there
as
well
the
taste
followed
the
smell
with
really
good
fruitiness
and
spices
to
offset
the
sweet
its
not
what
you
normally
expect
in
a
beer
and
in
my
mind
is
closer
to
a
sweet
wine
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
750ml
is
too
much
for
me
a
12oz
bottle
every
couple
years
would
be
enough
or
a
big
bottle
to
share
with
a
group
recommend
trying
because
of
the
uniqueness
and
history
3
5
rb
ml
o
overall
i
think
this
is
one
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
what
it
is
i
the
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
gives
it
more
uniqueness
that
i
can
see
many
people
not
liking
if
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
i
probably
would
not
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
so
wait
for
your
sugartooth
to
come
before
opening
this
one
up
not
something
i
would
keept
on
hand
but
a
novel
taste
experience
worth
trying
what
more
can
i
say
beautiful
chateau
jiahu
is
the
first
malt
beverage
my
wife
could
actually
down
a
glass
of
calling
this
a
beer
is
probably
not
right
its
more
like
a
mead
to
me
pours
a
cloudy
golden
peach
color
with
orange
highlights
and
a
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
quite
floral
with
notes
of
honeysuckle
rose
and
chrysanthemum
along
with
a
light
fruitiness
of
ripe
banana
and
champagne
grapes
as
well
as
a
bit
of
perfume
taste
begins
with
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
honey
nectar
along
with
flowery
chrysanthemum
followed
and
balanced
by
powdery
yeast
a
grape
tartness
and
peppery
alcohol
quite
unique
be
sure
not
to
have
this
beer
too
coldnear
room
temperature
seems
ideal
e
brad
d
this
says
it
is
fermented
with
sake
yeast
but
i
thought
sake
was
fermented
with
aspergillus
oh
well
honestly
i
think
this
drinks
like
a
crappy
white
wine
i
am
glad
i
didnt
live
in
ancient
china
interesting
yes
worth
purchasing
no
it
isnt
worth
trying
it
seems
like
it
is
but
the
flavor
are
not
exotic
they
are
mundane
mix
of
cup
of
cheap
reisling
with
a
colt
45
and
you
are
pretty
much
on
target
i
definitely
wont
buy
this
again
the
only
way
anyone
should
try
it
is
if
they
buy
it
with
some
freinds
definitely
a
sugary
beer
but
not
cloying
in
a
syrupy
or
alarminglysweet
way
also
not
the
utterly
incredible
concoction
we
tend
to
expect
from
dogfish
head
those
who
dislike
sweet
beers
might
as
well
not
even
bother
with
it
considering
the
price
its
a
different
sort
of
experience
and
theres
something
to
be
said
for
that
when
it
comes
to
dfhs
historical
brews
midas
touch
is
better
but
this
one
is
still
worth
the
time
and
effort
somewhat
interesting
but
not
enough
to
buy
again
tasters
note
thanks
to
amatuerbeerguy
for
sharing
this
one
my
numbers
reflect
my
overall
impression
of
this
brew
nice
appearance
great
nose
overpowering
honey
midtaste
finish
im
glad
i
bought
this
one
was
on
a
recommendation
from
mikes
mom
at
brawleys
in
charlotte
n
c
my
only
concern
was
the
price
15
bucks
a
pop
is
steep
a
little
disappointing
for
fifteen
dollars
but
an
experience
i
wanted
to
have
knowing
the
origin
of
the
recipe
that
being
said
i
wish
this
beer
were
rougher
around
the
edges
it
definitely
displays
the
brewing
knowhow
of
a
highly
respectable
craft
brewery
i
think
dogfish
head
should
have
made
an
attempt
to
make
this
beer
a
little
more
authentic
perhaps
not
filtered
it
as
much
maybe
guessed
at
the
bottling
point
instead
of
measuring
metabolization
rates
interesting
sweet
unique
decent
appearance
head
fades
fast
nice
cloudy
appearance
though
smell
was
very
nice
a
little
bit
of
banana
phenol
taste
was
unique
tastes
a
little
funky
no
hops
detected
however
there
are
some
bitter
notes
only
slightly
however
nice
malt
has
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
a
lot
going
on
and
a
funkiness
with
yeast
very
interesting
a
great
brew
to
give
wine
drinkers
and
beer
drinkers
a
like
dogfish
head
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
they
are
unique
and
adventures
offcentered
ales
for
offcentered
people
well
im
a
little
offcentered
i
guess
and
i
love
there
beers
and
will
continue
to
pay
top
dollar
to
get
them
shipped
to
me
very
nice
the
body
is
medium
and
there
is
something
tannic
about
this
beer
i
am
having
no
problem
drinking
the
750ml
but
i
would
not
pop
another
one
tonight
i
admire
the
effort
behind
this
brew
its
good
and
its
a
really
cool
idea
i
didnt
like
their
midas
touch
as
much
which
was
similar
but
it
was
priced
much
better
at
1213
for
a
bottle
this
is
a
one
off
for
me
if
it
were
7
or
8
i
could
see
getting
it
again
though
i
think
the
concept
of
an
ancient
beverage
is
definite
success
but
its
more
of
a
novelty
unless
it
were
cheaper
i
get
a
bit
of
booze
as
well
and
some
yeasty
dough
notes
the
beer
seems
incomplete
in
my
opinion
did
fermentation
not
run
its
full
course
not
very
impressed
with
this
brew
even
though
it
has
a
good
story
and
interesting
recipe
yet
another
unique
beer
rolled
out
from
the
dogfish
head
brewery
in
delaware
this
one
lives
up
to
their
standards
as
something
you
typically
wont
find
from
any
other
brewer
in
the
world
the
idea
came
when
a
professor
from
the
university
of
pa
asked
to
recreate
an
alcoholic
beverage
that
was
recently
discovered
in
9000
year
old
clay
pots
the
beer
itself
still
tastes
like
a
fruit
or
spiced
beer
but
it
has
its
own
uniqueness
as
well
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
offsetting
spice
no
hops
are
used
in
this
beer
so
it
is
not
susceptible
to
skunking
if
you
are
drinking
one
by
yourself
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
it
isnt
easily
detectable
so
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
recommended
for
a
try
but
im
sure
you
will
like
it
the
spice
in
this
one
are
not
as
blunt
and
overpowering
as
they
are
with
many
other
herbedspiced
ales
out
there
and
personally
i
think
that
makes
it
a
lot
more
drinkable
plus
the
delicate
fruit
flavors
of
the
palate
are
quite
nice
recommended
d
the
ale
is
interesting
worth
a
look
like
midas
touch
for
the
unusual
history
behind
it
this
beer
will
never
be
a
goto
drink
but
it
is
interesting
and
innovative
as
dogfish
head
seems
to
do
consistently
drinkability
i
would
serve
this
as
you
would
a
sweet
sparkling
wine
its
really
an
interesting
beer
but
the
whole
bomber
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
an
excellent
pair
with
white
chocolate
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
definitely
not
a
football
game
beer
it
is
enjoyable
to
drink
but
a
750
ml
bottle
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
sample
regardless
of
the
strengths
or
weaknesses
a
taste
of
sweetness
is
present
first
from
the
honey
and
then
the
spices
kick
in
out
of
nowhere
the
grape
juice
hits
my
palate
it
appears
to
be
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
but
i
am
still
searching
for
hops
i
still
cant
find
them
the
tail
end
of
the
glass
has
a
warm
ciderish
feel
to
it
maybe
its
the
idea
of
a
9000
year
old
recipe
being
accessible
or
maybe
i
am
just
warm
and
tingly
from
another
fantastic
dogfishhead
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orange
honey
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
leaves
no
lacing
and
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
alittle
weak
with
grapeshoney
some
spices
and
some
unknow
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
different
very
wine
like
makes
this
an
unusual
beer
honeygrapes
apples
lemon
sweet
malt
and
a
bisquity
flavor
make
out
this
beer
the
mf
is
medium
and
creamy
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
this
beer
is
a
little
tough
to
drink
more
than
onebut
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
trying
something
different
i
was
a
little
wary
about
this
beer
but
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
i
really
did
not
like
midas
touch
and
thought
this
beer
may
be
like
that
but
this
is
totally
different
worth
a
shot
but
the
price
makes
this
a
one
time
deal
atleast
for
me
i
can
dig
these
wineified
beers
to
some
degree
though
i
think
the
wine
could
stand
to
be
scaled
down
in
favor
of
more
malt
appears

drinkability
a
rare
treat
that
should
be
sampled
with
friends
this
big
bottle
could
become
a
chore
but
definitely
a
beer
i
would
like
to
revisit

it

is
good
tooim
going
to
drink
the
rest
of
the
bottle
and
wish
i
had
more
after
it
drinkability
average
i
was
disappointed
in
the
actual
taste
of
this
beer
the
smell
and
appearance
are
such
wonderful
experiences
that
the
flat
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
however
if
this
is
truly
authentic
then
i
feel
pleased
to
be
tasting
a
part
of
history
i
also
feel
that
this
is
a
necessary
brew
for
the
public
to
be
a
part
of
so
that
more
is
learned
in
the
history
of
beer
d
i
am
having
a
samplerglass
of
this
and
doubt
i
would
want
any
more
d
another
unique
beer
from
sam
this
one
was
enjoyable
but
i
am
starting
to
learn
i
am
not

fan

and
some

pleasant
flavour
with
low
bitterness
and
plenty
of
fruit
character
mostly
fresh
grapes
which
lingered
in
the
finish
it
also
had
a
light
acidity
that
brought
the
fruit
forward
a
little
bready
with
some
peppery
spice
in
the
finish
and
some
earthiness
moderate
carbonation
with
a
medium

soft
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
super
easy
drinking
beer
very
tasty
and
refreshing
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
but
a
bit
odd
and
at
14
for
this
bottle
ill
sip
and
enjoy
slowly
a
unique
brew
that
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
with
a
friend
lightly
carbonated
served
cool
side
of
room
temp
to
maximize
flavor
surprisingly
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
balance
of
acidity
and
sweetness
soft
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
peachy
floral
honey
not
cloying
a
really
pleasant
sipper
before
dinner
the
history
is
fascinating
so
definitely
an
interesting
brew
to
try
i
would
even
buy
this
again
despite
the
fairly
steep
price
a
well
made
beermead
that
was
remarkably
enjoyable
a
super
interesting
beer
that
tastes
unlike
anything

of
interest
to
white

drinkers
poured
a
murky
golden
yellow
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
faded
only
slightly
aroma
was
very
similar
to
a
macro
at
first
very
strong
aromas
of
rice
wafting
from
the
glass
but
later
on
i
could
pick
up
on
some
malt
honey
rose
petals
and
grape
taste
had
a
definite
sourwiney
characteristic
along
with
flavors
of
honey
almond
and
the
previously
mentioned
rice
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
drinkability
was
average
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
sake
mead
wine
and
your
typical
macro
it
was
worth
a
try
i
guess
if
only
to
sample
an
ancient
recipe
but
its
unlikely
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
again
i
am
not
enamoured
of
this
beer
but
presumably
it
is
a
oneoff
from
dfh
and
another
example
of
considerable
research
and
creativity
in
their
beer
mix
drinkability
is
great
a
balanced
and
very
tasty

good

has

leaving
a

the

the
overall

as
not
to
make
it
overly
sweet
but
it
is
still
dominatly
sweet
overall
great
job
dfh
if
this
is
what
they
drank
in
ancient
time
then
pour
me
another
as
it
warms
i
am
starting
to
pick
up
much
more
of
a
sake
taste
and
that
is
what
this
beer
finishes
with
all
and
all
an
interesting
drink
i
actually
prefer
this
to
midas
touch
i
would
drink
this
again
ill
have
to
as
i
have
another
bottle
but
would
prefer
to
share
with
a
couple
of
people
one
glass
is
really
more
than
enough
would
make
an
interesting
before
or
after
dinner
drink
poured
out
a
super
light
golden
honey
color
with
a
bubbly
bone
white
head
that
eventually
fizzed
to
nothing
the
nose
had
copious
amounts
of
honey
in
it
as
well
as
fresh
green
apple
and
flowery
notes
the
taste
was
again
led
by
honey
followed
by
some
near
sickeningly
sweet
floral
flavors
overall
this
was
an
interesting
history
lesson
but
not
for
me
an
enjoyable
beer
if
it
relly
qualifies
as
a
beer
not
bad
but
not
entirely
enjoyable
mouthfeel
a
touch
dry
and
tart
but
mellow
with
some
hints
of
an
odd
alcoholiv
elemnet
that
i
believe
is
brought
about
by
the
sake
i
like
sake
but
i
love
beer
what
an
interesting
combination
thank
you
to
finepaws
who
let
me
try
a
sample
of
this
from
the
bottle
she
won
this
one
definitely
was
a
draw
at
the
carolina
bewmasters
post
meeting
reminds
so
much
of
midas
touch
but
without
the
saffron
according
to
someone
who
knows
their
stuff
hazy
orange
color
with
little
carbonation
lots
of
different
fruits
and
spices
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
its
counterpart
enjoy
the
story
just
as
much
as
the
beer
definitely
worth
trying
and
sharing
with
friends
edit
in
retrospect
the
most
impressive
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
it
completely
masks
its
respectable
8
abv
without
the
help
of
any
obvious
inyourface
flavors
wavz
overall
this
is
an
odd
duck
its
worth
a
try
is
a
great
conversationstarter
and
it
sure
has
a
pretty
bottle
but
know
that
its
definitely
a
niche
beer
nicely
balanced
with
a
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
probably
from
the
honey
and
addition
of
muscat
grapes
the
foundation
of
the
muscat
really
shines
through
with
hints
of
peach
honey
suckle
apricot
and
on
the
finish
an
almost
pineapple
flavor
very
ripe
and
sweet
which
does
hurt
drinkability
but
what
i
would
consider
more
of
an
after
dinner
drink
well
this
thing
is
just
too
sweet
thats
it
honey
and
fruit
sweets
are
the
definitive
tastes
here
all
the
way
nice
carbonation
good
little
head
cloudy
like
a
belgian
wheat
the
flavor
is
soooo
sweet
tho
that
you
cant
drink
even
this
whole
pint9oz
bottle
no
way
i
corked
it
and
ill
leave
the
rest
for
my
roommate
share
this
beer
i
mean
its
not
bad
at
all
just
so
damn
sweet
the
brew
has
a
creamy
texture
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
but
given
the
sweet
rich
nature
of
the
beer
i
couldnt
have
but
one
of
the
1
pint
9
6
oz
well
i
wont
exactly
be
bringing
this
to
any
office
party
except
maybe
archaeologists
it
is
quite
interesting
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
drinkable
hard
for
my
mouth
to
choose
wine
or
beer
here
in
the
end
it
is
a
science
experiment
what
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
work
folks
the
day
before
thanksgiving
after
finding
it
at
new
beer
distributors
in
manhattan
served
in
a
wine
glass
the
half
cloudy
bright
yellow
mixtured
produced
only
a
smidgen
of
head
that
did
not
last
for
much
longer
than
it
took
to
pour
very
fresh
effervescent
aroma
with
some
unsweetened
fruit
scents
upon
the
first
sip
i
got
a
big
mouthful
of
bready
biscuity
yeast
flavors
very
delicious
as
it
warmed
up
i
started
to
get
more
of
the
winesake
grape
flavors
very
refreshing
and
tastey
as
well
i
had
two
small
glasses
of
this
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
another
great
brew
from
dfh
pours
a
hazy
bright
goldenpeach
color
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
that
winds
down
to
some
fine
bubbled
swirls
the
nose
is
alcoholic
with
big
fruity
floral
esters
yeasty
and
some
grapefruit
notes
the
first
sip
is
like
carbonated
white
wine
yeasts
sour
fruit
orange
rind
and
floral
characters
follow
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
intensity
gives
way
to
a
defined
honey
sweetness
very
much
like
a
mead
now
developing
later
is
something
like
pine
and
unripe
bananas
as
well
as
some
sweeter
burnt
sugar
and
malt
characters
lying
underneath
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
concoction
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
my
girlfriend
got
a
case
of
the
750
ml
bottles
for
me
go
figure
this
was
a
just
because
gift
all
i
know
now
is
that
its
going
to
end
up
being
pretty
expensive
for
me
either
way
i
poured
it
into
a
large
pint
glass
and
it
seemed
very
carbonated
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
head
that
had
a
quickish
retention
rate
that
left
the
glass
clean
it
has
a
very
strong
aroma
that
was
kind
of
fruity
and
sweet
like
a
honey
smell
duh
it
was
brewed
with
honey
and
various
fruit
the
color
i
thought
was
rather
orange
not
like
the
color
but
like
the
fruit
lighted
than
the
color
the
taste
was
extremely
complex
with
so
many
flavors
to
many
to
mention
but
really
good
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
rigid
at
first
but
very
smooth
down
the
throat
great
beer
dont
drink
and
review
found
this
at
sams
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
despite
the
suggestion
of
a
tumbler
this
pours
an
extremely
hazy
white
orange
yellow
amber
its
almost
a
peach
color
the
head
dissipated
very
fast
and
only
lingers
around
the
very
edges
of
the
beer
however
this
might
not
be
the
beers
fault
both
the
smell
and
color
are
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
this
far
it
smells
of
white
grapes
pears
grass
it
really
does
smell
like
a
pino
gris
or
a
sauvignon
blanc
the
taste
is
similar
to
wine
so
different
yet
very
pleasing
part
of
me
just
wants
to
say
its
an
extremely
atypical
beer
and
at
the
same
time
i
feel
like
i
can
trace
the
roots
of
it
back
to
certain
varietals
one
things
for
sure
it
is
a
very
special
beer
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
slightly
tart
with
lots
of
light
fruit
and
a
sort
of
crisp
buttery
flavor
the
mouthful
is
nice
and
the
strength
is
just
right
its
not
a
beer
id
get
all
the
time
but
its
totally
worth
a
try
and
for
novelty
sake
show
a
friend
the
recipe
is
9000
years
old
pours
a
hazy
yellow
almost
golden
about
14
inch
head
it
first
smelled
like
a
sauvignon
blanc
with
lots
of
citrus
notes
on
the
nose
although
you
could
tell
it
was
going
to
be
a
bit
rich
as
soon
as
hit
the
palate
i
was
amazed
at
how
much
flavor
this
beer
had
there
was
notes
of
honey
peach
banana
and
a
bit
of
white
grapes
the
finish
is
amazing
i
felt
as
if
the
taste
lasted
for
up
to
a
minute
the
dominant
flavor
was
obviously
honey
this
was
a
bit
rich
in
my
mouth
which
i
think
helped
in
the
lasting
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
suprising
beer
definitely
an
interesting
brew
tasty
at
room
temperature
and
deserves
to
be
sipped
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
lace
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
little
honey
spices
and
alcohol
presence
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
with
some
fruit
flavors
and
a
lot
of
honey
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
brew
mostly
because
of
its
story
the
beer
itself
is
just
slightly
above
average
and
not
something
i
will
likely
go
back
to
especially
considering
its
high
price
tag
single
bottle
for
7
99
at
tullys
it
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
the
taste
was
pretty
much
all
honey
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
too
sweet
plus
it
needs
to
be
drunk
cold
it
loses
flavor
when
it
warms
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
if
its
cool
not
so
much
past
about
50
degrees
enjoy
as
a
light
brew
while
looking
at
the
really
cool
label
hawt
asians
on
the
bottle
are
always
a
plus
not
as
good
as
dfhs
previous
foray
into
historical
beer
midas
touch
but
still
worth
a
shot
murky
yellowlight
orange
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
citrusy
grapey
and
floral
tastes
fruity
floral
honeyish
ricey
medium
bodied
very
complex
actually
rather
pleasant
and
drinkable
the
flavor
gets
extra
points
for
being
complex
and
unique
as
well
as
rather
enjoyable
i
may
very
well
get
this
one
again
kudos
once
again
dfh
for
15
this
one
isnt
a
really
good
bet
its
novel
to
try
new
stuff
from
dfh
and
especially
novel
to
consume
a
9000
year
old
yeast
strain
but
this
one
stops
at
the
novelty
dont
feel
bad
if
you
dont
get
around
to
this
one
d
a
bit
too
sweet
for
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
a
totally
intersting
concept
for
a
beer
would
definitely
drink
recomend
anytime
poured
into
a
heavy
glass

over
the

head
is

taste
is
sweet
upfront
subtle
grape
and
other
fruit
in
the
middle
and
honey
takes
back
over
for
the
close
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
limited
by
syrupiness
and
drinkability
is
quashed
even
more
by
same
another
one
of
the
historic
brews
that
i
have
to
appreciate
their
perserverance
to
create
but
its
just
not
something
id
revisit
d
the
smooth
and
tangy
flavor
is
not
really
a
triple
and
not
really
a
fruit
wine
but
has
a
nice
flavor
that
is
pretty
interesting
maybe
life
9000
years
ago
wasnt
so
bad
cool

pours
a

moderately

juice
bitterness
in
an
otherwise

interesting
and
warming
very
fruity
and
sweet
overall
big
bodied
with
a
syrupy
feel
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
very
different
from
anything
else
out
there
with
one
exception
midas
touch
i
find
quite
a
few
similarities
between
the
two
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
trying
but
personally
at
13
a
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
although
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
this
ages
when
the
alcohol
begins
to
fall
out
seems
to
fall
towards
the
belgian
end
of
things
but
it
sufficiently
unique
to
bring
something
new
to
the
table
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
like
to
grab
again
to
see
how
it
does
with
a
little
bit
of
age
on
it
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
a
very
flavorful
and
unique
beer
id
highly
reccomend
trying
it
i
think
a
full
750
might
be
a
bit
much
to
knock
down
in
one
sitting
but
is
perfect
with
a
friend
or
recapped
and
saved
for
day
2
this
would
be
an
awesome
dinner
pairing
or
perfect
to
introduce
a
winegeek
friend
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
i
find
the
carbonation
a
little
too
intense
for
my
taste
but
it
would
not
prove
a
deterent
to
drinking
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
but
doesnt
really
amount
to
heavy
cloying
overall
its
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
texture
highly
recommended
interesting
beer
its
a
hazy
goldcopper
with
some
chunks
as
you
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
lacing
is
ok
the
smell
is
sweet
grape
wine
maybe
not
the
most
beerlike
but
pleasing
none
the
less
taste
is
somewhere
between
a
mild
barleywine
and
a
fruit
melomel
its
a
sweet
grapey
flavor
with
lingering
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
graininess
leaves
something
to
be
desired
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
would
be
fine
but
is
hampered
slightly
by
the
high
abv
overall
a
unique
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
glad
i
found
this
bottle
at
city
wide
this
week
first
of
all
its
a
d
h
i
havent
seen
before
but
more
importantly
its
a
beer
brewed
with
hawthorns
which
is
a
host
to
the
particular
fly
that
im
studying
for
my
phd
work
ive
had
various
food
items
made
with
hawthorns
before
but
this
is
my
first
beer
very
exciting
so
it
pours
out
looking
like
carbonated
grapefruit
juice
and
has
a
little
tiny
head
that
fails
even
to
cover
the
entire
top
really
looks
like
a
mead
or
melomel
or
something
which
is
essentially
what
i
plan
to
think
of
it
as
more
or
less
considering
its
origins
smells
like
a
cyser
i
drank
at
the
bells
brewpub
hints
of
white
wine
flowers
and
of
course
hawthorns
which
i
can
clearly
pick
out
after
working
with
them
for
so
long
taste
is
delicate
and
thin
squeezed
watered
down
haw
juice
oranges
some
alcohol
noticeable
really
just
very
delicate
and
wine
line
and
not
at
all
overbearing
if
they
were
really
drinking
this
back
way
back
in
the
day
then
they
were
probably
doing
pretty
well
for
themselves
very
nice
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
got
to
give
to
dogfish
head
for
taking
a
risk
in
creating
some
interesting
and
wonderful
brews
while
in
columbus
with
my
wife
i
stop
at
grape
of
mirth
and
found
a
bottle
of
chateau
jiahu
poured
a
thick
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
rocky
white
head
once
poured
a
wonderful
scent
of
pear
honey
and
bread
rush
into
my
nose
my
wife
got
a
good
whiff
of
grapes
banana
and
musty
grass
both
agreed
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
full
body
necture
thick
and
softly
carbonated
this
brew
starts
sweet
honey
fruity
and
malty
bread
and
ended
sweet
spicy
and
peppery
at
9
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
present
but
well
hidden
a
warm
feeling
going
down
reminds
you
its
there
unlike
my
wife
who
loves
drinking
spiced
herbed
beers
i
found
it
hard
to
drink
much
of
it
ill
stick
to
my
dipa
ipa
and
stouts
in
all
this
brew
rocks
the
complex
flavors
aromas
and
a
full
body
makes
it
a
well
balanced
and
tasty
brew
got
to
love
dfh
9
5
is
a
bit
much
for
a
session
beer
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
easy
drinking
beers
out
there
750
ml
bottle
the
label
says

abv
md
smooth
up
front
with
a
dry
finish
decent
mouthfeel
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
nice
honeyherb
balance
a
decent
beer
if
it
were
cheaper
id
buy
it
more
often
overall
an
interesting
beer
its
pretty
good
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
dessert
wine
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
rather
honeylike
with
a
delicate
offwhite
head
aromas
of
honey
and
flowers
theres
a
bit
of
a
sakeish
sour
tinge
to
the
aroma
and
you
can
certainly
smell
the
minerality
and
fruit
of
the
muscat
grapes
used
to
make
this
on
the
palate
very
sweet
initially
with
the
honey
coming
out
along
with
a
cloying
sweetness
that
seems
to
pop
up
in
beers
made
with
grapes
very
coating
mouthfeel
heavy
with
lots
of
sharp
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
very
cool
to
try
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
particularly
tasty
the
historical
novelty
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
though
way
to
go
dogfish
definitely
a
winner
but
somewhat
of
an
enigma
this
reminds
me
of
the
excellent
baladin
nora
in
its
unique
floral
and
spice
profile
very
complex
and
a
pleasant
challenge
to
identify
whats
in
the
recipe
i
look
forward
to
my
next
adventure
with
this
excellent
replication
of
a
9000
year
old
chinese
recipe
medium
bodied
very
fruit
and
drinkable
definitely
a
unique
brew
i
hope
they
keep
on
making
this
d
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
this
definitely
not
outstanding
at
least
when
compared
to
my
favorite
beers
but
definitely
drinkable
although
not
in
large
quantities
share
the
bottle
with
a
friend
im
not
sure
if
ill
buy
this
again
but
props
to
dfh
for
thinking
outside
the
box
on
this
one
newly
distributed
to
central
kentucky
this
is
a
warm
welcome
the
orange
straw
murky
look
promises
honey
sweetness
fruity
flavors
and
a
firm
body
the
beer
doesnt
disapoint
tremendous
honey
sweetnees
without
cloying
very
fruity
with
pears
peaches
and
ripe
apples
very
winelike
with
a
satisfying
malt
base
spices
of
giner
clove
nutmeg
and
corriander
give
the
beer
an
added
complexity
and
compliment
the
beer
well
an
earthy
herbal
quality
persists
the
beer
though
viscous
in
the
start
finishes
with
a
drinkable
tartness
and
dryness
quite
clean
for
such
a
sweet
and
varying
beer
sorta
midas
touchlike
just
better
dogfish
just
won
me
over
again
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
one
very
nice
bottle
it
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
mostly
of
grapes
and
some
honey
sweetness
along
with
a
touch
of
spices
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
wow
the
flavor
is
strange
lots
of
honey
character
along
with
some
spices
but
only
a
very
slight
peppertype
spice
some
grape
flavor
along
with
a
lot
of
other
stuff
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
makes
for
an
extremely
complex
flavor
that
isnt
over
the
top
just
strange
its
much
better
and
extremely
more
drinkable
and
smooth
than
i
expected
the
alcohol
is
only
barely
apparent
the
body
is
on
the
heavy
end
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
wonderful
strange
beer
hazy
honey
glazed
amber
with
sunlight
highlights
at
the
margins
short
collar
of
fine
bright
white
bubbles
and
no
visible
carbonation
streams
sweet
lightly
spiced
aromas
punctuated
with
hints
of
white
wine
initially
sweet
and
sticky
tastes
like
a
sweet
white
wine
fill
the
mouth
there
is
a
good
handful
of
spice
through
the
middle
that
almost
gets
out
of
hand
and
carry
long
into
the
finish
as
does
a
bit
of

body
that
is
heavy
and
a

thick

a
low
level

chateau
jiahu
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
midas
touch
however
it
was
heavier
and
thicker
and
the
spices
were
bit
more
in
the
forefront
interesting
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
in
the
future
ill
probably
break
out
the
bottle
i
have
at
thanksgiving
the
beer
poured
a
somewhat
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
into
a
chalice
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
a
pleasant
nose
of
honey
and
grapes
floral
similar
to
what
i
remember
of
the
midas
touch
but
not
exactly
the
same
the
taste
was
a
pleasing
mix
of
grapes
and
honey
and
more
floral
notes
from
the
aroma
as
others
have
mentioned
very
similar
characterstics
to
a
sharp
white
wine
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
but
seems
to
be
more
than
just
a
beer
gives
a
dry
finish
and
with
a
somewhat
light
body
i
find
it
pretty
darn
drinkable
even
for
a
9000
year
old
recipe
great
job
sam
and
mike
i
will
have
to
give
this
one
a
try
in
bottle
as
well
there
isnt
really
a
whole
lot
to
compare
it
to
so
if
you
dont
mind
tart
beer
give
it
a
go
just
to
say
you
have
because
it
really
isnt
too
bad
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
im
glad
ive
tried
it
d
drinks
well
like
a
decent
wine
seems
unfair
to
compare
it
to
beer
of
any
type
when
it
seems
much
more
similar
to
a
german
white
that
being
said
its
smooth
and
ill
be
getting
more
the
drinkability
is
high
very
nice
indeed

2nd
review
following
having
it
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
when
it
first
came
out
hazy
whitish
yellow
sort
of
color
pleasant
odor
of
fruit
and
spices
with
a
lemon
tinge
to
it
sweet
lemon
and
grass
like
flavors
slight
tartness
to
it
thin
mouthfeelthough
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
overall
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
bodywise
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
seems
a
summery
sort
of
thing
better
then
my
last
encounter
for
sure
while
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
since
its
not
really
my
scene
it
is
good
and
worth
a
try
i
found
this
interesting
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
it
had
a
very
complex
yet
pleasant
taste
a
lot
of
layered
fruits
surprisingly
viognier
like
im
curious
as
to
what
grapes
were
actually
used
in
this
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
however
dont
expect
a
typical
herbspiced
beer
this
is
a
pretty
unique
creation
m
it
is
like
a
mix
between
champagne
and
a
thick
hefeweisen
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
sweet
fruity
foreign
and
different
with
a
starchiness
that
makes
you
ponder
it
upon
its
sweetly
semidry
finish
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
special
treat
overall
a
happy
surprise
i
was
not
holding
out
too
much
hope
for
this
experiment
but
i
do
like
an
adventure
it
is
less
exotic
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
very
pleasing
nonetheless
i
think
midas
touch
has
the
upper
hand
over
the
chateau
jiahu
just
in
level
of
complexity
but
overall
they
are
both
fun
and
drinkable
brews
drinkability
drank
mine
with
some
yellowfin
tuna
that
i
had
caught
just
days
prior
to
this
review
this
would
go
well
with
any
kind
of
fish
or
a
sushi
meal
overall
a
nice
sweetness
balanced
with
the
tart
bite
and
earthiness
throughout
it
went
very
well
with
my
dinner
of
balsamic
vinegar
peach
pork
chops
a
fine
experiment
that
i
hope
they
keep
brewing
the
bottle
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
though
so
i
recommend
sharing
drinkability
definitely
interesting
to
try
these
ancient
beer
recreations
but
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
a
bunch
of
one
is
enough
to
try
and
finishing
the
bottle
in
one
sitting
was
a
slow
process
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
captures
the
imagination
and
shatters
the
boundaries
of
time
the
poignant
sensory
experience
evoked
by
this
libation
transcends
the
effects
of
great
historical
texts
i
liken
this
profound
discovery
to
procuring
an
obscure
long
lost
scroll
from
the
very
ashes
of
alexandria
currently
on
tap
at
the
dogfish
head
alehouse
in
gaithersburg
maryland
9
per
snifter
the
best
way
i
could
describe
this
is
a
cross
between
a
whitbier
and
dogfish
heads
own
midas
touch
ale
its
a
shade
lighter
than
midas
but
it
has
head
unlike
midas
the
spices
and
slight
fruitiness
remind
me
of
a
whit
but
the
flavor
and
feel
of
the
beer
is
complex
and
hard
to
describe
much
like
midas
touch
the
waiter
rattled
off
a
long
list
of
spices
that
are
used
in
making
the
beer
none
of
which
i
remember
at
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
a
pleasant
little
kiss
of
hops
very
interesting
and
quite
outstanding
much
more
drinkable
than
the
aforementioned
dfh
beer
and
possibly
the
nextbestthing
to
dfhs
redandwhite
whitbier
which
i
never
got
to
try
drinkability
well
i
have
to
give
it
a
little
off
for
that
since
it
is
a
bit
strong
and
expensive
and
it
had
a
little
more
wine
character
than
i
would
have
liked
but
it
was
interesting
and
worth
the
experience
i
must
say
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
with
the
first
few
tastes
but
after
about
the
third
sip
i
was
sold
this
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
their
appetizer
the
dog
pile
this
is
a
beer
i
would
serve
with
a
nice
goat
cheese
fish
or
an
aperitif
due
to
its
dryness
its
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
a
very
interesting
addition
to
sam
cs
ever
evolving
beer
portfolio
definitely
worth
a
sampling
unique
i
wasnt
sure
i
was
drinking
a
beer
but
a
sake
infused
ale
almost
no
head
present
but
a
nice
pour
a
nice
smell
but
definitely
overtones
of
rice
based
on
a
5000
year
old
chinese
recipe
the
ricesake
taste
is
to
be
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
flowery
tones
pervasive
to
the
tongue
the
drinkability
was
very
nice
at
almost
10
abv
you
wouldnt
expect
such
drinkability
as
this
but
it
went
down
very
smootly
too
smoothly
overall
a
very
nice
drink
but
i
still
feel
that
i
was
drinking
a
slightly
carbonated
herbed
infused
sakebeer
good
job
dfh
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
no
head
at
all
maybe
a
bubble
or
two
but
thats
it
barely
any
smell
at
all
slight
sweet
smell
came
through
as
it
warmed
some
as
it
was
served
ice
cold
the
taste
was
more
like
a
white
wine
than
a
beer
sweet
tart
some
grape
and
woody
tones
no
carbonation
thin
body
with
a
slick
dry
finish
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
beer
next
time
i
am
there
served
in
a
750ml
bottle
crown
cap
no
label
what
can
you
say
this
is
dfh
at
its
finest
say
what
you
want
about
their
ipas
this
brewery
is
built
on
experimentation
one
of
the
few
that
legitimately
pushes
the
boundaries
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
great
beer
but
its
unique
and
interesting
that
at
least
counts
for
something
dark
straw
colored
massive
wild
head
light
fragrant
chamomile
scent
taste
is
a
bizarre
champagne
and
floral
pungent
fruit
mixture
shades
of
overripe
mango
which
gets
stronger
as
it
warms
almost
a
dinnermint
finish
this
is
hilariously
nonbeer
to
my
tastes
but
after
drinking
it
i
would
absolutely
substitute
it
for
a
celebratory
champagnewine
drink
confounding
never
really
had
anything
like
this
one
quite
delicious
enjoyable
o
interesting
not
much
to
it
but
i
think
thats
the
point
a
little
fruity
and
pretty
bready
a
very
interesting
beer
the
pour
is
a
light
orange
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
seemed
all
over
the
place
at
first
with
hints
of
sage
the
tea
leaves
and
other
herbs
before
i
caught
the
fruits
the
taste
was
very
earthy
with
all
of
the
spices
before
sweet
fruits
coming
out
big
near
the
end
it
was
very
layered
and
complex
and
offered
interesting
insight
to
ancient
beer
flavors
worth
a
try
although
not
an
every
day
kind
of
beer
25
oz
bomber
in
a
tulip
glass
bottled
2012
hazy
straw
in
color
smells
of
sweet
bread
and
fruitcant
tell
what
kind
taste
is
sweet
very
unique
chamomile
is
pronounced
maybe
some
honey
its
unique
a
little
abrasive
with
the
chamomile
so
pronounced
im
also
unsure
what
effect
the
aging
had
better
rating
due
to
uniqueness
and
ambitionprobably
would
not
drink
again
though
chamomile
zaatar
and
doum
fruit
are
perfectly
intertwined
into
this
awesome
but
a
tad
pricey
session
ale
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
taking
into
account
the
purpose
not
just
randomly
tasting
a
bunch
of
beers
thinking
of
it
as
a
liquid
time
capsule
allows
me
to
appreciate
it
to
the
fullest
extent
with
no
offensive
flavors
or
smell
and
a
light
drinkable
body
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
brew
it
has
unique
flavors
i
have
not
experienced
before
and
is
quite
enjoyable
instead
of
walk
like
an
egyptian
you
can
now
drink
like
an
egyptian
perhaps
dogfish
should
have
used
that
line
on
the
bottle
all
those
exotic
spices
and
fruits
i
mentioned
are
evident
in
the
taste
more
so
than
the
toasted
malts
and
crisp
clean
but
mellow
hops
at
the
end
i
felt
like
watching
ben
hur
after
drinking
this
this
one
is
strange
its
thin
and
herbal
its
like
an
alcoholinfused
carbonated
tea
with
a
turmericlike
spice
suspended
in
it
its
not
quite
a
beer
which
i
like
very
muchbut
i
also
definitely
knew
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
when
i
picked
up
this
bottle
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
chalky
a
little
herbal
and
quite
funky
i
will
remember
it
well
but
wont
drink
it
more
than
once
every
couple
of
years
i
think
overall
a
pretty
interesting
beer
pretty
neat
of
dog
fish
head
to
have
an
ancient
beer
line
it
was
good
but
not
12
good
overall
a
very
fun
drink
despite
the
price
of
the
bomber
sweet
light
cornywheaty
this
will
never
be
a
regular
drink
for
anyone
but
its
an
intriguing
candy
tasting
beer
that
will
make
you
smile
i
havent
tried
the
other
historical
brews
from
dogfish
head
but
im
betting
that
this
is
among
the
most
approachable
of
the
lot
thumbs
up
this
is
a
unique
brew
the
flavors
are
plentiful
and
combine
very
well
this
is
something
different
which
is
what
dogfish
head
does
best
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
a
slightly
tartfunky
yeast
presence
that
dominates
the
flavor
this
was
really
strong
in
the
nose
and
stands
out
here
as
well
grassy
and
herbal
with
resinous
hops
straw
damp
hay
and
wild
bugs
followed
by
floral
rose
water
sweet
malts
light
fruit
and
booze
somewhat
dry
chalky
and
earthy
with
sunflower
seed
oil
caramel
malt
toffee
and
biscuit
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
some
dark
and
light
fruit
esters
and
boozy
sweetness
as
well
but
theres
not
much
heat
i
would
have
guessed
higher
than
4
5
but
its
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
decent
complexity
but
some
of
the
flavors
clash
with
each
other
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
its
an
interesting
experiment
and
they
successfully
captured
the
wild
egyptian
yeast
i
dont
think
that
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
poured
a
semicloudy
golden
with
a
tiny
bit
of
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
not
quite
as
thick
as
some
egyptian
beers
are
described
in
tomb
finds
but
ill
take
it
scents
of
fruit
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
some
apricot
notes
a
good
scent
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
is
light
and
crisp
slightly
sweet
with
light
apricot
and
fig
notes
and
a
backbone
of
grain
and
wheat
cracker
with
some
yeasty
bread
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
bready
flavors
and
blends
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
its
an
excellent
beer
and
probably
the
best
of
the
ancient
ales
ive
tried
taste
echoes
the
nose
very
bready
with
a
tinge
of
exotic
fruit
this
is
an
easytodrink
brew
wellbalanced
and
a
little
sweet
but
still
very
much
a
beer
and
an
exceptional
one
at
that
if
this
were
bottled
in
regular
6packs
id
buy
more
a
superb
beer
proving
that
the
ancient
egyptians
apparently
knew
what
they
were
doing
o
as
a
history
lesson
this
is
cool
to
think
maybe
this
is
what
the
egyptians
drank
but
its
not
what
i
drink
or
want
to
drink
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
but
was
good
to
have
it
once
just
for
the
experience
thats
pretty
much
why
i
love
dogfish
head
this
was
brewed
to
push
envelope
and
provide
an
experience
not
just
to
sell
more
beer
ill
probably
try
it
again
at
some
point
when
i
can
secure
a
fresh
sample
maybe
at
the
brewery
itself
the
aromatic
spices
in
this
beer
are
likely
at
first
to
remind
you
of
feet
then
bread
and
middle
eastern
cuisine
if
you
read
the
reviews
no
one
really
knew
what
this
was
supposed
to
taste
like
so
i
recommend
trying
it
anyway
pours
a
golden
straw
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
will
notice
the
spices
in
the
beer
no
real
hops
taste
in
this
and
it
has
has
low
carbonation
as
well
which
makes
it
sweet
in
a
weird
way
the
fruit
whatever
kind
of
fruit
that
was
is
noticeable
because
the
flavor
of
it
seems
to
go
very
well
with
those
spices
its
the
strangest
beer
i
have
had
but
im
not
sorry
i
bought
it
the
bottle
is
freaky
cool
a
little
surprised
at
such
a
low
score
here
on
ba
no
its
not
a
hop
bomb
or
r
i
s
but
this
was
a
delightful
surprise
well
done
overall
a
very
unique
beer
definately
not
one
of
my
favourites
but
worth
a
try
although
im
struggling
to
finish
the
bottle
overall
interesting
brew
not
really
my
bag
but
unique
as
hell
from
my
perspective
worth
a
shot
tastes
as
advertised
o
i
understand
this
was
an
historical
brew
the
earliest
beer
recipe
even
however
it
was
to
worst
tasting
beer
ive
have
so
far
in
2013
o
a
very
unusual
beer
from
dfh
great
for
bringing
to
a
bottle
share
worth
a
try
a
unique
beer
drinkable
taste
is
nice
aroma
is
a
detriment
get
rid
of
that
onion
and
smoke
and
you
have
an
ok
beer
here
an
easy
drinker
with
not
much
complexity
not
bad
not
great
pale
gold
with
a
huge
white
head
minimal
retention
or
lace
nose
has
sweet
bready
malt
herbal
character
chamomile
isnt
distinct
on
the
nose
taste
has
more
sweet
grain
obscure
fruit
and
herbal
qualities
that
im
struggling
to
pin
down
as
with
all
of
the
beers
in
this
dfh
series
medium
feel
medium
high
carbonation
couldnt
find
much
i
enjoyed
from
this
a
struggles
to
put
back
o
this
is
a
wellblended
crisp
beer
that
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
lots
of
very
interesting
flavors
it
was
fun
to
try
but
it
was
a
bit
to
much
for
such
a
big
bottle
i
just
got
a
little
tired
of
drinking
it
perhaps
with
the
heat
of
the
sahara
it
might
fit
the
bill
this
is
a
peculiar
beer
and
it
grows
a
bit
tiresome
after
not
even
half
the
bottle
thankfully
the
abv
is
reasonably
low
if
this
were
a
boozy
creation
its
doubtful
i
could
drink
it
1520
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
especially
in
the
warmer
months
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
and
i
almost
didnt
get
it
because
it
is
on
the
pricey
side
but
upon
seeing
the
arabic
seasonings
my
interest
was
peaked
i
am
glad
i
went
for
it
well
done
in
my
opinion
lovely
full
head
with
a
slow
fade
and
decent
lacing
smell
has
a
light
breadiness
with
an
unusual
fruit
component
some
almost
lactic
like
sourness
chamomile
and
other
light
spices
as
well
and
a
very
faint
mint
tea
taste
is
light
a
crisp
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
sweet
malt
and
bread
chamomile
shows
up
here
and
the
fruit
im
sure
but
not
having
eaten
it
i
cant
finger
it
feel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
high
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
for
what
it
is
as
an
attempt
to
recreate
the
egyptian
beer
recipe
this
one
scores
o
this
was
an
interesting
brew
definitely
not
my
favorite
dfh
but
not
my
least
favorite
actually
definitely
preferred
this
a
little
bit
more
then
the
my
antonia
i
had
right
after
fairly
exotic
and
definitely
unique
however
like
i
said
its
not
my
favorite
blend
of
fruits
and
spices
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
probably
not
something
that
i
would
pick
up
again
o
was
hoping
to
really
like
this
and
was
only
midly
enjoying
it
of
the
dfh
ancient
ales
id
put
this
below
chateau
jihau
sahti
and
midas
touch
just
didnt
find
it
too
tasty
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
crystal
clear
light
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
mild
fruity
nose
and
flavor
seems
like
bread
honey
and
chamomile
no
idea
what
doum
fruit
tastes
like
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
its
39
14
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
o
interesting
and
unique
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
overall
props
for
making
something
old
something
new
again
not
an
everyday
ale
or
one
that
will
wow
you
but
interesting
to
see
how
an
ancient
beer
might
have
tasted
with
respect
to
homage
one
is
trouble
on
how
to
define
and
rate
this
beer
by
authenticity
which
is
hard
to
confirm
or
by
style
herb
spiced
where
it
is
at
best
average
certainly
worth
a
look
if
your
a
beer
historian
who
wants
to
try
something
with
respect
to
its
beginings
just
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
even
if
your
a
die
hard
dogfish
head
this
wasnt
the
intended
purpose
decided
to
give
this
a
try
while
visiting
the
fairfax
brewpub
in
virginia
its
a
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
modest
white
head
and
fair
lacing
smells
like
mild
chamomille
dough
with
other
floral
dust
ideas
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
but
not
bad
the
flavor
brings
lemon
tea
and
more
of
the
smell
theme
with
ideas
of
apple
and
heather
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
muted
mint
again
sort
of
odd
but
interesting
its
light
bodied
and
somewhat
watery
in
feel
with
delicate
carbonation
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
bad
at
all
weird
weird
weird
weird
beer
i
cant
believe
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
as
it
was
such
a
strange
taste
i
expected
more
from
dogfish
especially
at
14
99bottle
there
was
just
this
really
offputting
smelltaste
that
i
couldnt
get
past
it
was
kind
of
like
perfumed
soap
and
basil
i
usually
enjoy
dogfish
beers
but
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
o
this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
even
though
the
abv
is
rather
low
the
flavor
combination
is
interesting
and
it
makes
it
a
tough
beer
to
finish
strangely
i
have
had
this
beer
two
times
and
it
has
given
me
a
headache
almost
immediately
both
times
these
ancient
ales
are
always
fun
to
try
some
i
like
more
than
others
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
moose
the
mintbread
aroma
is
different
and
reminds
me
of
moroccan
mint
tea
which
i
drink
regularly
light
orange
bodied
and
big
lace
a
lighter
mouthfeel
some
mint
and
other
herbal
tastes
i
dont
get
it
not
for
me
tastewise
so
not
too
drinkable
well
done
and
enjoyable
dfg
o
relaxing
unique
a
wowzer
this
stuff
is
fun
to
drink
this
beer
had
some
nice
complex
flavor
the
spices
were
very
apparent
but
not
overwhelming
the
flavors
were
very
well
balanced
o
an
interesting
beer
with
a
great
story
behind
it
not
wow
but
not
terrible
either
hard
to
describe
overall
very
interesting
brew
to
think
about
taste
and
analyze
o
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
in
the
spirit
of
being
exposed
to
new
and
different
things
and
im
glad
that
i
did
i
find
the
idea
behind
this
beer
laudable
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
to
me
it
tastes
like
an
acceptable
pilsner
not
so
good
for
me
ancient
ale
from
dfh
so
always
prepared
for
something
different
color
is
somewhat
perfectly
orange
not
yellow
and
not
quite
red
head
disappears
in
less
than
15
seconds
smell
and
taste
is
somewhat
sour
with
a
hint
of
lemon
plus
the
other
odd
fruits
used
to
make
this
beer
low
abv
allows
it
to
be
somewhat
a
session
beer
ignoring
price
with
a
strong
flavor
i
probably
would
not
go
for
this
beer
again
but
i
am
still
glad
i
tried
it
i
am
always
happy
to
experiment
with
new
beers
styles
and
glad
that
dogfish
head
frequently
provides
this
opportunity
t
i
was
hoping
for
some
bolder
flavors
but
this
is
actually
good
some
hints
of
white
peach
doughy
yeast
cereal
malt
and
some
faint
indistinguishable
spices
leaves
a
bit
of
a
tart
aftertaste
a
very
different
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
do
it
again
but
its
a
cool
experiment
overall
this
beer
is
crisp
easy
drinking
and
has
some
wonderful
flavors
it
is
a
very
good
brew
although
i
am
not
sure
it
is
quite
worth
the
price
you
will
pay
for
it
overall
this
beer
is
ok
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
retick
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
nose
is
light
and
spicy
it
has
bready
light
spicing
and
of
course
specific
fruit
and
spice
that
im
not
familiar
with
the
flavors
folks
suit
it
is
light
and
lager
esque
with
an
interesting
array
of
spices
it
drinks
very
light
in
body
as
an
ancient
recipe
i
could
see
this
one
being
quite
popular
and
somewhat
unique
it
has
more
flavor
than
english
ales
thats
funny
almost
two
thousand
years
ahead
of
the
brits
this
one
is
worth
a
try
for
noveltys
sake
caramelized
malt
clings
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
with
sweet
fruit
caressing
the
tongue
fruit
is
a
bit
plumlike
no
hops
sensed
malt
and
fruitspice
dominant
light
on
the
palate
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
you
wondering
aroma
is
like
no
other
beer
i
have
tried
i
got
some
chalky
and
tuna
whiffs
as
well
as
malt
fruit
and
what
must
have
been
chamomile
or
was
it
the
zaatar
it
pours
a
clear
solar
yellow
with
an
average
smallbubbled
white
head
that
leaves
some
ok
lacing
flavor
is
distinctive
if
not
fabulous
with
a
malty
core
a
fruity
undertone
and
notes
of
what
must
be
the
zaatar
there
is
a
whisper
of
something
like
tuna
salad
smooth
texture
has
slightly
aboveaverage
body
and
some
good
fizz
even
if
this
is
not
an
outstanding
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
just
because
it
is
so
distinctive
and
unusual
the
flavor
is
truly
interesting
there
is
an
exotic
twist
that
is
delivered
mostly
through
the
chamomile
though
the
fruit
and
special
wheat
do
make
a
difference
the
mouthfeel
however
was
not
as
successful
it
is
fine
that
the
beer
had
a
light
mouthfeel
but
the
watery
nature
to
the
finish
distracts
from
the
interesting
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
worth
trying
but
it
is
not
a
hoard
beer
a
beer
so
good
you
buy
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
when
you
can
if
they
brewed
it
again
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
heft
in
the
body
ta
henkets
a
very
good
brew
drinkable
and
flavorful
id
buy
a
six
pack
if
it
was
available
in
small
format
too
bad
its
so
expensive
o
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
dogfish
head
experimentalancient
beers
ive
had
light
and
easy
drinking
quite
complex
and
interesting
not
sure
it
is
something
id
seek
out
again
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
id
definitely
have
it
again
willingly
if
placed
in
front
of
me
tasting
this
unique
brewing
approach
some
getting
used
to
it
will
take
place
wheat
and
chamomile
are
dominating
bread
spices
and
tart
will
follow
this
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
is
full
of
surprises
interesting
brewing
pours
a
clear
goldenhay
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
a
bit
like
a
saison
but
with
some
interesting
spices
in
there
unfortunately
theres
also
a
smell
that
is
somewhat
akin
to
styrofoam
that
throws
things
off
a
bit
flavor
is
certainly
interesting
and
unique
though
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
there
is
a
mix
of
spices
that
i
cant
quite
identify
here
its
very
light
and
somewhat
saisony
but
the
spices
make
it
less
refreshing
than
it
could
be
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
some
pretty
bigtime
carbonation
its
a
little
too
overcarbonated
for
my
tastes
but
its
not
a
huge
problem
overall
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
as
well
as
it
could
if
you
could
eliminate
a
bit
of
the
off
flavors
and
aromas
it
couldve
been
a
nice
spicy
saison
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
different
and
unique
flavors
mixed
in
but
the
overall
beer
is
nice
and
balanced
and
very
sessionable
drinkability
i
like
it
a
lot
it
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
o
an
interesting
but
uninspiring
beer
drinkable
pleasant
but
ultimately
meh
o
unusual
if
you
arent
into
spices
you
may
want
to
steer
clear
the
overriding
smell
and
back
end
taste
are
unique
could
use
some
more
heft
o
not
a
fan
average
compared
to
other
beers
but
lacking
when
it
comes
to
dogfish
head
ones
felt
a
little
underwhelmed
with
this
one
o
this
was
a
completely
different
experience
than
when
i
had
it
on
tap
and
completely
unenjoyable
to
say
the
least
im
pretty
disappointed
because
i
remember
actually
liking
this
one
a
lot
maybe
aging
it
for
a
few
months
ruined
it
but
i
dont
see
how
as
it
wasnt
that
long
of
a
time
span
d
sam
and
dogfish
always
try
to
push
the
bounds
and
do
something
very
unique
theyve
certainly
achieved
that
here
and
while
i
typically
am
a
huge
fan
of
there
endeavors
this
one
was
a
struggle
i
couldnt
recommend
in
good
faith
to
anyone
than
those
seeking
a
truly
unique
beer
and
have
a
very
open
mind
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
would
have
no
interest
in
drinking
again
750
ml

bottling
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
1
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
a
ring
of
lacing
minimal
glass
lacing
and
a
slight
stream
of
carbonation
coming
up
aromas
of
chamomile
biscuit
pepper
black
tea
lemon
herbs
grass
light
citrus
honey
and
yeast
funk
and
spiciness
very
interesting
and
odd
aromas
but
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
taste
is
more
pleasant
than
the
aromas
honey
lemon
herbs
chamomile
black

licorice
wheat
bread
pepper
and
yeast
spices
lingering
notes
of
herbs
black

on
the

for
a
bit
nice
flavor
balance
and
good
complexity
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
a
touch
watery
feeling
but
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
no
alcohol
noticed
on
the
taste
or
finish
as
expected
for
4
5
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
ancient
ale
recreation
from
dogfish
head
once
again
nice
balance
and
good
complexity
with
easy
drinking
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
beer
on
the
whole
but
very
middle
of
the
road
more
interesting
is
the
story
of
the
egyptian
yeast
but
doesnt
offer
up
too
much
beside
that
o
very
different
brew
for
sure
i
really
like
the
idea
and
the
attempt
at
history
on
this
brew
o
ok
nothing
i
need
again
o
the
taste
is
certainly
better
than
the
strange
scent
implies
an
interesting
experiment
leaves
me
strangely
drawn
to
wanting
more
despite
not
being
too
enamored
mildly
repellant
oddly
attractive
one
of
the
downsides
of
this
beer
im
noticing
however
is
that
it
gets
pretty
phenolic
after
a
bit
almost
band
aid
like
maybe
the
bottle
is
best
split
amongst
friends
notes
maybe
one
the
best
new
big
bottle
releases
from
dfh
i
have
tried
in
the
last
year
or
beyond
nice
to
try
and
in
the
right
context
this
could
work
great
socially
the
background
is
stimulating
enough
as
it
is
with
the
idea
of
a
brew
aiming
at
cloning
ancient
egyptian
brews
then
tailored
and
upgraded
to
contemporary
palates
i
sure
would
have
loved
to
try
a
sample
with
the
sulphur
but
how
they
got
rid
of
it
and
let
the
fruit
shine
is
quite
nice
too
not
top
tier
of
their
historic
brews
but
something
that
i
might
repeat
overall
cant
complain
at
all
most
of
the
time
when
i
think
of
dfh
i
think
of
their
stronger
beers
and
ales
this
is
something
unique
that
you
would
definitely
love
image
summer
months
salud
interesting
beer
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
the
spicing
is
not
overdone
the
funk
from
the
wild
yeast
is
very
mild
hard
to
imagine
a
wild
yeast
not
yeilding
a
product
that
is
even
remotely
sour
o
very
interesting
light
brew
in
dfhs
expanding
ancient
beer
series
the
middle
eastern
ingredients
are
like
a
history
lesson
on
the
palate
the
4
5
abv
is
quite
manageable
but
id
be
searching
for
just
the
right
pairing
to
have
more
than
one
glass
o
very
unique
a
must
try
but
i
doubt
i
will
repeat
it
nose
is
a
bit
sour
herby
slightly
sulferous
pours
out
dark
yellow
with
huge
frothy
white
head
head
reduces
to
a
foamy
film
no
lacing
at
all
taste
is
surprizingly
mild
no
bitterness
unhopped
bready
with
a
hint
of
chamomile
and
somewhat
figgy
doum
fruit
i
can
see
the
pyramid
builders
having
something
very
much
like
this
very
nice
othis
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
it
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
style
with
a
middle
eastern
touch
to
it
its
extremely
drinkable
and
has
a
such
a
nice
and
balanced
complexity
considering
the
low
abv
overall
in
the
end
you
have
to
take
ta
henket
for
what
it
is
the
ancient
ales
are
always
interesting
so
i
had
to
take
a
step
back
and
appreciate
this
beer
from
the
perspective
of
what
went
into
it
it
tasted
quite
unrefined
and
rugged
and
while
there
was
definitely
a
plainbland
quality
to
the
depth
of
the
beer
i
picture
it
being
an
everyday
brew
of
the
masses
in
ancient
egypt
an
interesting
experience
that
i
enjoyed
i
have
to
say
that
the
presence
of
chamomile
was
most
intriguing
as
it
really
came
through
in
the
finished
product
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
chamomile
which
probably
prejudices
me
against
this
one
as
a
historian
i
was
really
hoping
to
like
this
one
but
eh
overalli
like
this
beer
and
i
dont
like
it
i
see
what
dfh
was
going
for
but
i
think
it
couldve
been
executed
better
still
a
very
unique
brew
overall
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
another
unique
exhibition
by
dogfish
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
puffy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
there
is
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
and
herbs
that
i
cannot
identify
taste
is
of
grains
herbs
and
spices
there
is
a
slightly
spice
forward
aftertaste
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
not
something
i
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
very
interesting
story
behind
this
one
and
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
o
a
solid
beer
overall
a
little
less
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
but
is
solid
against
the
style
definitely
would
buy
again
this
is
a
great
session
beer
overalldrinkability
a
very
unusual
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
cant
see
getting
it
again
a
beer
worth
expanding
the
palate
with
and
maybe
with
a
pizza
rather
than
the
crab
cakes
i
had
it
would
work
even
better
but
by
itself
just
interesting
to
see
an
potential
take
on
an
ancient
style
but
not
an
everyday
drinkable
beer
however
i
will
again
give
it
points
for
being
such
a
creative
and
palate
challenging
beer
drink
wont
creep
up
the
ladder
as
a
favorite
of
mine
from
dfh
but
i
am
intriqued
by
what
sam
and
staff
put
out
and
will
keep
trying
their
beers
into
a
wine
glass
pours
a
bright
and
clear
yellow
gold
under
a
very
thin
head
aroma
is
of
mild
earthy
zesty
fruit
light
bodied
malt
feel
with
a
crisp
carbonation
sets
forth
a
very
subtle
but
flavorful
blend
of
delicate
herbs
and
fruit
the
phrase
less
is
more
comes
to
mind
here
and
i
cant
help
but
think
of
how
much
id
like
to
introduce
this
to
my
green
folk
who
dont
like
beer
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
was
especially
interested
to
have
it
after
seeing
its
creation
on
brew
masters
was
it
worth
trying
certainly
would
i
have
it
again
probably
not
o
without
a
doubt
i
have
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
before
and
probably
never
will
again
what
brought
me
to
try
this
beer
was
the
brew
masters
ancient
ale
episode
where
dogfish
head
goes
through
a
painstaking
process
to
reproduce
an
ancient
egyptian
beer
recipe
dubbed
ta
henket
after
watching
their
dedication
and
creativity
hard
at
work
i
can
truly
appreciate
getting
to
finally
experience
this
beer
ill
be
honest
though
im
not
sure
how
the
egyptians
managed
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
assume
after
drinking
a
bomber
i
realized
two
things
1
a
single
bomber
was
more
than
enough
for
me
and
2
beer
has
come
a
looong
way
over
the
last
several
thousand
years
evolution
is
a
beautiful
thing
overall
it
was
not
good
and
did
not
get
better
as
i
downed
more
of
the
bottle
i
love
trying
new
styles
and
experimental
beers
but
this
was
just
not
good
at
all
to
me
and
the
taste
and
aroma
were
so
far
off
that
i
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
thankfully
i
have
a
120
minute
ipa
in
my
beer
fridge
to
remind
me
of
why
i
love
dogfish
head
so
ill
give
them
another
mulligan
on
this
one
this
was
a
valiant
effort
at
recreating
history
but
this
beer
could
have
stay
buried
with
the
lost
ark
out
in
the
desert
dogfish
head
certainly
is
a
trailblazer
ta
henket
is
one
of
its
beers
where
the
back
story
is
a
little
better
than
the
beer
frankly
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
be
a
standout
success
its
not
a
total
disaster
maybe
worth
a
try
this
beer
may
have
been
hard
for
me
to
describe
due
to
the
ingredients
however
it
is
solid
and
different
from
the
usual
examples
of
the
style
they
are
constantly
trying
to
outdo
themselves
with
each
new
release
i
like
it
o
definitely
an
interesting
beer
a
distinct
herbal
flavour
so
those
that
dont
like
that
might
want
to
stay
away
but
for
the
adventurous
this
is
worth
a
buy
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
snifter
no
head
with
a
slightly
hazed
vibrant
honeygold
coloring
light
nose
with
honey
bready
and
earthy
notes
all
roasted
into
a
subtle
blending
some
interesting
spice
on
the
nose
too
flavors
are
roasted
and
almost
tea
like
in
nature
with
a
earthy
and
spicy
profile
that
is
light
on
the
tongue
but
fills
the
sinuses
honey
sweet
highlights
along
with
some
floral
essences
keep
the
palate
light
and
interesting
the
beer
is
smooth
initially
but
the
light
body
becomes
sharp
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
when
the
spicing
becomes
more
prominent
the
aftertaste
is
honeysuckle
sweet
and
herby
leading
to
a
light
clean
finish
this
beer
is
an
interesting
rollercoaster
for
the
senses
in
both
taste
and
feel
pretty
tasty
o
blah
this
one
is
a
miss
from
dogfish
hopefully
it
was
a
one
off
o
aside
from
the
smell
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
given
the
low
abv
a
bit
pricey
overall
but
certainly
worth
a
try
at
least
once
o
i
enjoy
midas
touch
and
jumped
at
the
chance
to
snag
a
bottle
of
this
beer
as
long
as
you
are
open
about
it
being
a
departure
from
the
standard
drinking
experience
you
should
find
it
enjoyable
ehh
its
ok
gotta
give
props
to
dfh
for
continuing
to
push
the
envelope
here
c
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
attractive
lively
carbonation
one
finger
moderate
bubble
white
head
that
had
good
retention
largely
due
to
the
continual
carbonation
earthy
herbal
aroma
probably
due
to
the
zaatar
unidentifiable
exotic
fruit
which
is
appropriate
somewhat
musky
this
is
definitely
outside
the
range
of
standard
beer
aroma
but
it
is
intriguing
definitely
the
most
unusual
flavored
beer
ive
ever
had
light
malt
wheat
oregano
or
thyme
somewhat
nutty
and
a
hint
of
citrus
finishes
with
nutty
sweet
malt
there
is
a
distinct
flavor
in
the
finish
that
reminded
me
of
something
id
tasted
before
and
it
just
came
to
me
a
flavor
very
reminiscent
of
genmaicha
the
toasted
rice
green
tea
from
japan
this
is
very
enjoyable
the
flavor
combination
really
worked
for
me
light
to
moderate
body
as
expected
for
the
abv
no
one
has
an
absolute
idea
of
what
these
early
protobeers
tasted
like
but
this
is
as
good
a
guess
as
any
with
interesting
regional
spices
and
a
definite
refreshing
quality
this
is
an
experiment
that
worked
out
quite
nicely
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
if
it
ever
becomes
available
odstrange
beer
i
didnt
hate
it
kinda
glad
i
tried
it
gimmicky
in
my
opinion
but
it
could
have
been
worse
perhaps
the
most
memorable
beer
i
had
all
night
d
not
bad
it
is
light
and
weirdly
earthy
but
i
find
it
to
be
strangely
drinkable
kind
if
like
a
midas
touch
light
single
finger
thick
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
slightly
hazy
golden
body
aroma
is
mostly
light
grain
and
malt
but
not
very
overwhelming
the
flavor
is
interesting
i
am
getting
a
strong
gingerbread
flavor
throughout
however
initially
a
grainy
and
pale
malt
flavor
is
present
corn
note
and
semisweet
finish
light
bodied
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
actually
very
drinkable
and
with
the
right
amount
if
sweetness
the
pour
is
fairly
uninspiring
a
deeper
gold
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
fruity
and
bitter
smells
interesting
for
sure
the
taste
is
smooth
at
first
with
a
nice
hit
of
wheat
and
herbs
then
the
spices
roar
in
for
the
finish
the
aftertaste
lingers
pleasantly
with
a
touch
of
wheat
and
a
nice
spiced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
nicely
drying
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
manages
to
skirt
the
dogfish
curse
of
being
too
sweet
its
probably
a
touch
expensive
but
its
a
solid
experience
id
recommend
o
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
surprising
low
abv
for
a
dogfish
head
beer
o
it
would
be
an
goodaverage
sessionable
beer
if
not
for
the
sourness
which
makes
it
taste
like
it
has
gone
bad
i
guess
it
is
just
different
m
initial
thought
spicy
but
not
quite
as
exotic
tasting
as
the
hieroglyphics
would
indicate
as
always
dfh
earns
some
points
for
creativity
but
overall
this
was
underwhelming
d
great
smell
even
as
the
taste
is
completely
different
and
unexpected
of
all
the
occasional
rarities
that
they
put
out
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
few
i
would
ever
purchase
again
while
i
have
enjoyed
some
of
the
other
rarities
in
the
past
i
found
them
to
be
too
much
for
my
palate
4
0
d
i
gotta
give
dfh
a
lot
of
credit
for
brewing
something
like
this
its
superbly
interesting
which
is
always
welcome
since
everyone
else
is
doing
what
everyone
else
is
doing
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
this
more
than
once
a
year
but
its
a
good
departure
from
the
norm
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
smooth
has
nice
flavor
and
i
would
have
no
problem
downing
a
few
glasses
of
this
one
overall
i
think
it
is
a
really
cool
and
interesting
beer
i
love
i
can
get
a
chance
to
taste
something
similar
to
what
people
brewed
and
drank
so
long
ago
there
is
some
nice
sweetness
and
breadlike
flavors
in
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
spice
notes
i
didnt
think
they
were
too
aggressive
and
i
think
they
worked
well
i
definitely
think
this
one
is
worth
trying
and
i
would
drink
it
again
o
i
liked
this
much
more
than
expected
given
some
of
the
hate
floating
around
this
beer
perhaps
this
is
just
the
culmination
of
hipster
backlash
to
dogfish
heads
success
the
beer
that
symbolized
the
brewmasters
television
show
the
show
being
the
embodiment
of
publicly
selling
out
to
some
people
i
say
get
over
yourselves
this
was
a
fun
experiment
if
you
expect
this
to
be
a
daily
drinker
or
instawhale
youre
looking
at
it
all
wrong
i
would
never
want
to
drink
this
regularly
but
once
in
a
while
this
could
prove
to
be
a
fun
change
of
pace
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
wasnt
a
huge
fan
and
i
normally
like
dfh
beers
a
bit
weird
and
full
of
spices
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
interesting
from
archeological
point
of
view
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
seriously
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
its
a
pretty
good
beer
rvi
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
floral
and
nutty
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
nutty
perfume
toasted
malt
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
stood
out
to
me
at
all
it
was
fairly
complex
but
it
seemed
like
everything
in
this
one
was
just
clashing
with
each
other
worth
trying
to
say
you
did
but
not
that
impressive
for
my
palate
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
is
a
slow
sipper
another
beer
worth
seeking
out
to
at
least
give
it
a
try
this
may
not
be
a
beer
you
want
to
constantly
drink
but
it
will
shake
the
taste
buds
up
the
pour
is
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
but
tall
white
head
smells
strongly
of
cereal
and
grain
but
very
clean
lots
of
bread
maybe
even
some
corn
bread
and
tons
of
wheat
maybe
a
little
bit
of
yeast
too
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
quite
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
very
bready
with
the
same
wheat
and
corn
bread
flavors
some
yeast
as
well
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
weird
beer
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
the
flavors
are
light
but
never
seem
to
come
together
in
any
meaningful
way
the
sugar
content
of
the
fruit
combined
with
the
additional
sugar
makes
it
too
sweet
too
a
bit
odd
and
too
pricey
for
me
to
purchase
again
overall
its
difficult
to
find
a
way
to
objectively
rate
this
as
a
beer
since
it
bears
very
little
resemblance
to
anything
else
on
the
market
the
beverage
is
certainly
palatable
and
delicious
on
some
levels
and
if
not
told
this
was
a
beerif
say
i
were
in
egypt
and
told
this
was
a
locallymade
and
traditional
alcoholic
beveragei
would
think
it
excellent
the
buttered
toast
and
chamomile
flavors
are
a
bit
strong
and
i
admittedly
am
not
a
fan
of
chamomile
tea
but
there
are
enough
funky
sugar
flavors
to
bring
me
back
for
another
mouthful
definitely
worth
trying
even
if
only
for
the
experience
overall
this
was
really
an
odd
one
i
appreciate
what
dogfish
is
doing
in
beers
like
this
but
its
not
great
still
not
a
bad
beer
though
glad
i
got
to
experience
it
the
once
but
that
will
probably
be
it
for
this
one
o
mouthfeel
and
appearence
are
weak
for
a
traditional
beer
but
i
think
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
according
to
the
style
pretty
good
overall
drinkable
well
balanced
i
did
noticed
some
of
the
flavors
disappearing
after
the
beer
had
warmed
up
a
little
towards
room
temp
i
would
recommend
having
this
beer
cold
it
also
has
the
smooth
crisp
dryness
of
a
decent
lager
or
pilsener
which
i
found
quite
nice
pours
a
monumental
head
that
fills
half
the
glass
with
wispy
ofwhite
foam
not
much
retention
dissolves
without
dimpling
the
microbubbles
all
knit
together
average
lacing
not
a
lot
but
whats
there
sticks
in
wide
splotches
copper
orange
to
yellow
in
color
decent
clarity
hue
depth
also
adequate
like
zero
bubbles
to
be
seen
kinda
just
looks
like
beer
the
nose
is
quiet
to
subtle
brown
bread
crust
pretzel
dough
salt
and
pepper
orange
to
lemon
reduction
peach
apricot
pear
and
melon
fruit
scents
the
chamomile
comes
through
clearly
honey
and
then
some
cloves
but
really
no
one
element
leaps
out
at
you
here
mediumbodied
more
savory
than
sweet
carbonation
is
low
but
still
more
than
youd
expect
from
visual
inspection
salt
pepper
sage
rosemary
metallic
flecks
and
a
light
pinch
of
clove
and
cumin
the
chamomile
more
muted
here
however
the
orange
lemon
white
grapefruit
citrus
lasts
fully
throughout
as
in
the
nose
mildly
surprising
strength
in
the
apricot
peach
apple
melon
fruit
nothing
too
sweet
but
ripe
and
consistent
the
herbaceous
element
rises
as
it
warms
as
with
many
oneoff
beers
from
this
producer
it
very
credibly
feels
as
if
it
was
made
according
to
some
exacting
ancient
recipe
naturally
this
can
be
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
overall
impression
while
having
the
chance
to
buy
this
bruisin
ales
for
10
im
glad
i
didnt
this
sure
is
an
ancient
ale
and
wouldnt
let
anyone
around
me
make
the
mistake
of
buying
this
one
such
a
shame
because
ive
enjoyed
almost
all
dogfish
head
brews
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
light
golden
color
light
and
especially
fizzy
smells
are
some
interesting
hardtoplace
spices
wow
the
taste
is
pretty
out
there
with
all
of
the
oddball
ingredients
zaatar
doum
fruit
chamomile
emmer
farro
and
freerange
egyptian
yeast
it
isnt
too
much
of
a
surprise
this
tastes
like
nothing
ive
had
before
the
combination
yields
a
pretty
woodyflavored
taste
very
light
crisp
and
barely
alcoholic
it
is
different
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
although
not
one
i
will
probably
come
back
to
often
m
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
is
nice
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
very
light
and
at
4
5
abv
a
very
quaffable
brew
overall
i
most
likely
wouldnt
try
it
again
but
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
really
interesting
beer
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
minimal
lacy
head
the
aroma
is
just
plain
funky
i
cant
really
place
it
but
its
really
not
that
appealing
on
the
other
hand
it
tastes
way
better
than
it
smells
its
really
hard
to
describe
the
taste
i
dont
even
know
what
12
of
the
ingredients
in
the
beer
are
still
its
floral
earthy
and
utterly
unique
very
drinkable
and
doesnt
last
long
on
the
tongue
very
interesting
beer
ok
i
didnt
finish
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
glad
i
dropped
12
bucks
on
this
unique
style
of
beer
overall
not
that
appealing
to
me
however
i
appreciate
the
effort
in
attempting
to
replicate
an
ancient
beer
its
worth
trying
im
glad
i
did
but
once
is
enough
o
probably
the
best
new
dogfish
head
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
i
hope
we
see
this
again
o
split
with
friends
to
try
dont
expect
much
a
few
friends
liked
it
but
a
few
of
us
didnt
notes
besides
the
chamomile
i
have
no
idea
what
any
of
these
fruits
and
spices
are
between
the
exotic
spices
and
the
funk
i
think
many
will
be
turned
off
by
it
it
is
what
it
is
though
and
i
applaud
dogfish
head
for
having
the
guts
to
put
this
into
production
as
always
its
great
to
see
a
brewery
showing
respect
for
thousands
of
years
of
brewing
history
still
i
cant
quite
recommend
it
its
not
bad
and
im
very
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
buy
again
o
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
probably
a
better
summer
beer
than
anything
o
like
dfhs
midas
touch
ta
henket
is
an
out
there
type
of
beer
it
doesnt
fall
into
any
particular
category
but
it
does
have
a
decent
enough
flavor
o
i
appreciate
the
effort
of
creating
a
time
capsule
beer
but
this
one
is
not
all
that
appealing
an
overall
sweetness
rounds
out
a
nice
dessert
beer
would
go
very
well
with
holiday
spiced
cakes
and
cookies
o
despite
the
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
isnt
that
easy
to
drink
and
takes
a
lot
of
getting
accustomed
to
it
before
you
can
finish
the
bottle
o
overall
this
was
a
swing
and
miss
for
me
very
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
had
such
high
hopes
only
to
have
them
dashed
way
not
worth
the
price
point
o
odd
not
bad
certainly
not
great
it
has
an
interesting
taste
structure
that
i
can
appreciate
and
find
oddly
tasty
i
wouldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
it
but
i
would
not
turn
another
down
worth
a
try
that
is
some
cool
shit
kudos
to
dfh
for
having
the
balls
to
put
this
into
production
interesting
not
must
have
overall
uninspiring
and
dull
if
this
is
an
authentic
representation
of
some
ancient
civilizations
beer
then
they
drank
boring
beer
however
keep
up
the
creativity
dfh
normally
im
a
nut
when
it
comes
to
dogfish
heads
crazy
concoctions
this
beer
is
not
one
of
their
better
experiments
in
recreating
ancient
ales
the
beer
port
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dispenses
quickly
smell
is
like
wheat
and
some
muddled
herbs
pretty
boring
taste
starts
out
like
an
ok
wheat
ale
that
quickly
turns
into
a
guessing
game
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
heck
that
finish
is
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
almost
feel
flat
not
much
buble
not
much
feel
asside
from
some
peculiar
tastes
that
arent
great
but
arent
offensive
either
its
a
pretty
meh
beer
it
wouldnt
be
horrible
if
it
wernt
14
bucks
it
actually
may
have
been
better
warm
i
had
expected
it
to
be
an
indescribable
mess
but
wanted
to
try
it
since
like
a
lot
of
others
saw
the
brewmasters
episode
where
they
conceived
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
i
really
liked
this
and
could
see
how
someone
would
accept
two
gallons
of
this
stuff
as
a
days
wages
for
work
on
the
pyramids
poured
in
a
dfh
pint
glass
semiclear
golden
color
with
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
and
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
smell
is
almost
undiscribable
aromas
of
fermented
fruit
strange
herbs
and
perhaps
chili
peppers
the
taste
only
somewhat
reflects
the
smell
extremely
smooth
and
at
4
5
abv
very
easy
to
drink
strange
almost
spoiled
yeast
taste
that
i
have
never
encountered
but
was
pleasant
to
my
hefeweisen
loving
palate
i
fully
enjoyed
it
there
has
been
alot
of
bad
reviews
for
this
beer
but
if
one
takes
the
time
to
disect
each
flavor
and
takes
into
conscideration
the
effort
in
gathering
of
the
ingredients
i
think
it
can
be
a
great
drinking
experience
dfh
has
done
it
again
with
the
ancient
brew
series
nice
work
sam
priced
at
14
50
for
a
750ml
it
is
inline
with
the
other
dfh
special
brews
which
is
steep
but
the
quality
speaks
for
it
self
this
is
the
only
dfh
beer
my
wife
has
enjoyed
prost
o
did
not
enjoy
this
im
usually
a
big
fan
of
these
crazy
dogfish
head
beers
including
the
ancient
ales
this
was
pretty
terrible
though
i
respect
the
history
and
work
that
went
into
it
but
its
just
awful
waste
of
money
simple
savory
seems
like
what
an
ancient
protobreadbeer
would
probably
be
like
or
maybe
a
really
light
kvass
truly
unique
ancient
ale
from
dfh
im
thoroughly
enjoying
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
interesting
and
fun
to
dissect
as
it
is
so
subtley
complex
and
unique
some
will
say
that
its
just
another
gimmick
from
dfh
but
its
still
a
cool
concept
regardless
i
like
their
ancient
ales
series
and
im
very
glad
they
take
the
time
to
make
sure
that
theyre
not
another
cookie
cutter
brewery
they
owe
their
great
success
to
that
got
a
chance
to
try
this
over
new
years
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
first
off
cannot
get
over
the
pizza
flavors
specifically
pepperoni
pizza
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
pizza
flavored
goldfish
crackers
which
is
exactly
what
it
reminds
me
of
nice
bubbly
golden
color
in
the
glass
taste
is
again
quite
odd
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
with
fruitsspices
my
mouth
has
never
tastes
before
also
get
a
random
whiff
of
tuna
yeah
ill
leave
it
at
that
i
love
dfh
and
i
think
the
historical
beers
are
amazing
ideas
and
great
to
talk
about
in
conversation
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
o
overall
this
would
make
a
good
marinade
for
chicken
or
something
but
its
not
really
my
idea
of
a
good
beer
if
dfh
makes
off
centered
beers
this
one
is
an
off
the
rocker
beer
the
only
thing
that
really
saves
it
is
how
interesting
of
a
story
it
has
which
overall
makes
it
slightly
interesting
to
try
as
a
beer
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
or
drink
it
again
egyptian
ingredients
maybe
snake
oil
maybe
o
this
beer
is
not
as
undrinkable
as
some
have
made
it
out
to
be
but
that
is
not
saying
that
it
is
not
one
of
dogfish
heads
lesser
efforts
unfortunately
the
generic
appearance
horrible
combination
of
scents
on
the
nose
and
bloating
gassy
mouthfeel
conspire
to
ruin
this
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
i
will
not
be
purchasing
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awful
beer
nothing
in
it
worked
for
me
and
i
cant
drink
more
than
a
few
sips
of
this
what
a
waste
of
14
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
worst
beers
if
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
o
a
very
unique
ale
would
definitely
recommend
definitely
likable
and
approachable
even
my
wife
liked
it
my
hat
is
off
to
dfh
for
always
pushing
the
envelope
beer
is
grainy
arid
on
the
finish
harsh
difficult
to
drink
some
tea
comes
through
a
few
spices
but
there
is
the
underlying
sulfury
harshness
that
i
cant
support
nope
not
again
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
no
head
only
edging
and
it
leaves
little
to
no
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
nuts
with
some
smokiness
to
it
the
taste
has
a
bread
and
nut
backbone
with
a
slight
smokiness
to
it
there
are
also
some
notes
of
spice
along
with
a
fruit
sweetness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
solid
beer
it
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
it
is
for
sure
worth
a
try
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
bready
fruity
and
a
bit
herbal
i
notice
some
wheat
and
bready
malt
but
theres
also
a
weird
fruity
aroma
which
i
guess
is
the
doum
fruit
stated
on
the
label
and
some
herbs
and
spices
that
i
cant
identify
the
brew
tastes
like
wheatgrain
yeast
sweet
fruit
and
some
herbs
and
spices
i
think
thats
the
za
atar
on
the
label

is
lightmedium
its
moderately
carbonated
and
easy
enough
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
more
the
longer
i
drank
it
its
unusual
which
was
to
be
expected
but
i
thought
it
was
good
overall
id
buy
it
again
11
99
a
bottle
o
a
unique
beer
but
i
enjoy
it
its
definitely
too
expensive
to
convince
me
to
buy
another
bottle
but
its
tasty
and
smells
good
with
a
nice
body
if
it
came
in
sixers
for
around
the
price
of
a
single
bottle
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
it
overall
this
is
a
really
different
beer
i
enjoyed
my
sample
enough
but
would
have
been
upset
if
i
had
paid
for
a
whole
bottle
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
have
it
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
can
see
how
people
are
disliking
this
beer
but
i
think
dogfish
head
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
going
into
this
with
an
open
wind
is
helpful
this
is
not
a
normal
beer
but
a
unique
and
different
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
on
for
4
5
abv
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
overall
a
disappointment
compared
to
their
other
beers
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
orange
color
from
a
750ml
into
a
duvel
tulip
looks
and
smells
similar
to
that
of
a
domestic
light
beer
more
over
much
like
the
dfh
pearl
jam
beer
even
a
little
sweet
and
yeasty
its
hard
to
judge
the
taste
of
this
beer
considering
i
dont
know
what
doum
fruit
emmer
farro
and
zaatar
are
supposed
to
taste
like
i
certainly
havent
picked
up
on
the
chamomile
it
has
a
unique
taste
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
pepper
like
flavors
i
kept
getting
with
every
sip
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
in
there
too
which
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
had
a
light
body
to
it
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
addition
to
ancient
ales
the
dfh
puts
out
i
have
always
found
these
to
really
spark
my
interest
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sureknapp85dec

an
interesting
concept
but
not
for
me
the
flavor
just
doesnt
agree
with
my
palette
again
and
know
what
to
expect
in
this
type
of
adventurous
beverage

just
not

found

to

didnt

did
any

them

great
the
label
grabbed
my
attention
from
the
start
ancient
script
writing
in
the
style
of
my
ancestors
dogfish
head
infuses
their
beer
with
almost
anything
that
they
can
get
their
hands
onto
and
this
particular
offering
is
no
different
the
upside
to
the
beverage
is
that
it
tastes
almost
akin
to
a
juice
or
wine
very
smooth
and
fruity
with
a
distinct
smell
however
the
taste
is
lacking
considering
what
i
expected
and
given
the
variations
of
ingredients
that
they
added
to
the
beer
perhaps
eliminating
one
or
two
to
have
a
more
concise
impression
would
be
appreciated
interesting
to
try
and
would
certainly
recommend
sipping
on
it
if
available
locally
but
not
something
that
i
would
ever
come
back
to
pretty
good
not
what
i
expected
with
a
decent
tang
to
it
o
a
decent
spiced
beer
different
than
your
typical
brew
i
picked
one
up
on
clearance
but
at
full
price
im
unlikely
to
grab
one
again
an
interesting
experience
nevertheless
i
could
have
passed
on
this
one
v
low
value
almost
17
dollars
for
a
single
22oz
bomber
overall
i
am
happy
with
this
beer
though
it
has
a
slightly
strange
taste
but
i
love
trying
novel
things
and
loving
getting
to
connect
with
history
through
dfhs
ancient
ale
series
overall
this
was
a
positive
experience
very
good
but
not
worth
the
extremely
high
price
would
not
pay
that
much
17
bottle

lightly

in
a
session
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
poured
a
dark
brownish
with
a
fizzy
head
smells
earthy
and
the
taste
matches
up
with
it
very
carbonated
reminds
me
almost
of
a
wine
cannot
put
my
finger
on
all
of
the
different
spices
nothing
is
super
distinct
i
like
the
overall
taste
though
would
come
back
to
it
again
doesnt
really
taste
like
most
of
the
listed
ingredients
but
very
good
regardless
paired
with
curry
and
pork
overall
i
generally
do
not
like
dogfish
heads
ancient
beers
but
i
like
this
one
it
does
not
match
the
description
on
the
bottle
but
i
like
it
draft
poured
a
light
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
hazelnut
and
unrefined
grain
is
more
or
less
interesting
taste
is
also
dominated
by
unrefined
grain
with
some
strong
notes
of
hazelnut
with
some
residual
sugars
which
is
probably
derived
of
the
honey
that
was
added
to
this
beer
body
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
and
with
no
apparent
alcohol
i
appreciate
all
the
historical
research
that
went
into
this
beer
but
not
sure
i
really
enjoy
the
final
product
enough
to
try
this
one
again
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
just
a
mediocre
beer
overall
overall
drinkability
a
very
unique
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
but
thats
the
point
isnt
it
if
this
is
what
the
etruscans
were
drinking
roughly
over
2800
years
ago
then
count
me
in
for
enjoying
a
cup
from
time
to
time
i
picked
up
a
bottle
because
the
price
was
right
on
sale
5
99
and
aged
over
a
year
its
still
quite
good
it
paired
very
well
with
food
chicken
paillard
with
curry
gravy
and
red
lettuce
salad
and
as
a
very
fruity
beer
i
think
it
might
go
well
with
a
variety
of
other
foods
as
well
so
for
drinkability
i
never
got
tired
of
the
large
glass
i
poured
for
myself
and
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
well
hidden
overall
an
unique
experience
and
worth
a
try
i
might
actually
pick
up
a
bottle
again
if
the
price
is
right
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
has
its
charm
the
appearance
was
orange
with
some
darker
hues
through
it
the
smell
was
full
of
earthy
nutty
notes
but
almost
a
pinot
noir
smell
to
it
as
well
the
taste
wasnt
for
me
though
with
a
lot
of
raisin
and
fruit
flavors
where
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
hazelnut
and
more
heavy
flavors
still
an
interesting
beer
and
it
should
be
tried
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
another
taste
interesting
and
unique
starts
mildly
fruity
with
light
sweetness
yet
in
the
late
middle
turns
slightly
sour
finishing
with
an
earthy
lingering
mild
floral
note

and
did
their
best
to
recreate
an
alcoholic

from

its
an

honey
and
plenty
of
amber
malt
theres
a
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
the
amber
malt
that
is
very
prevalent
upon
tasting
theres
an
intense
peppery
earthiness
from
the
spices
its
aggressively
carbonated
but
has
a
drycrisp
finish
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
good
balance
among
all
of
the
different
ingredients
as
neither
of
them
seemed
to
be
overpowering
this
beer
could
pair
well
with
food
but
is
also
interesting
enough
to
drink
on
its
own
overall
another
interesting
experiment
but
a
failure
to
my
palate
overall
for
a
gruitherbed
beer
this
was
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
pours
reddish
amber
with
a
pearl
white
thin
head
some
lacing
has
a
pretty
great
smell
complex
definitely
lots
of
honey
and
pomegranate
banana
yeast
and
some
fruit
funk
taste
is
along
the
same
line
with
some
citrus
and
pepper
cant
really
pick
out
much
hazelnut
which
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
feel
is
light
and
crisp
works
well
with
the
citrus
and
mild
sour
flavors
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
a
great
trip
off
the
beaten
path
some
new
flavors
that
you
dont
see
much
and
i
applaud
dfh
as
always
for
trying
new
things
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
these
beers
is
reading
the
story
of
their
inception
and
history
and
this
one
has
some
great
flavors
to
go
with
it
o
very
interesting
ancient
ale
tons
of
flavor
very
complex
slightly
medicinal
and
funky
not
bad
would
def
go
for
another
pint
overall
this
is
a
crazy
beer
im
still
not
quite
sure
what
i
just
drank
interesting
just
too
crazy
extra
props
on
making
a
crazy
and
creative
beer
like
this
drinkable
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
o
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
lack
of
carbonation
and
head
detract
from
an
otherwise
very
appealing
beer
overall
unique
and
interesting
but
ones
enough
for
me
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
considering
how
quickly
it
went
flat
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
tastes
very
similar
to
the
notes
of
the
aroma
with
an
even
stronger
vinous
dark
fruit
presence
than
expected
some
earthy
musty
funk
along
with
strong
peppery
spice
again
im
guessing
the
myrrh
is
really
standing
out
with
an
earthy
resinous
flavor
along
with
some
peppery
clove
and
cardamom
the
pomegranate
raisin
and
other
dark
fruit
flavors
stand
out
throughout
the
palate
but
are
most
prominent
toward
the
back
end
lingering
long
after
the
finish
the
pomegranate
and
raisin
sweetness
is
very
prominent
along
with
grape
dark
cherry
currant
and
other
dark
berries
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
prunier
barbera
wine
with
strong
peppery
spice
and
slightly
tart
musty
funk
overall
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
more
interesting
than
some
of
the
other
ancient
ales
i
wouldnt
order
or
buy
it
again
but
i
enjoyed
trying
it
just
by
the
copper
appearance
and
sweet
notes
on
the
nose
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
another
interesting
find
from
dfh
unfortunately
this
is
out
of
bounds
for
my
liking
as
the
pomegranate
raisin
tart
profile
is
extremely
sweet
for
me
and
not
something
i
would
drink
again
body
is
really
pretty
light
considering
the
fairly
ample
alcohol
content
and
full
flavor
drinks
way
too
easy
always
luv
dfh
ales
ooverall
a
very
enjoyable
change
of
pace
you
can
taste
the
quality
in
the
ingredients
and
i
like
what
dogfish
does
its
a
brewery
that
hit
or
miss
is
the
essence
of
this
movement
is
all
about
and
i
recommend
this
brew
if
you
want
to
switch
it
up
with
the
ipas
and
stouts
in
the
fridge
cheers

d
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
while
im
always
glad
i
tried
a
strange
dfh
creation
i
usually
dont
think
they
are
worth
the
price
this
one
is
different
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
just
funky
i
applaud
dogfish
head
for
putting
it
out
there
but
etrusca
seems
to
be
a
take
it
or
leave
it
proposition
appearance
is
a
light
amber
color
with
moderate
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
the
smell
is
very
aromatic
and
much
like
the
taste
is
kind
of
dry
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
theres
a
lot
going
on
on
the
palette
when
you
take
a
drink
some
carbonation
overall
pleasant
the
taste
is
where
this
gets
interesting
ive
read
some
reviews
that
its
just
a
mishmash
of
many
different
things
and
while
that
is
kind
of
the
case
it
works
well
for
me
the
two
things
in
particular
that
stick
out
for
me
are
dry
and
pomegranate
the
dry
finish
is
what
reminds
me
of
a
nice
red
wine
so
maybe
that
falls
more
under
mouthfeel
but
nonetheless
overall
i
wish
they
brewed
more
of
it
one
of
my
favorite
alltime
dfh
brews
birra
estrusca
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
lively
carbonation
theres
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
but
they
work
together
nicely
to
make
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
o
this
beer
is
just
an
empty
attempt
to
create
something
unique
bland
flavors
meshed
in
something
that
is
passable
at
best
overall
contrary
to
the
generally
mediocre
reviews
of
this
beer
i
find
it
wonderful
normally
i
dont
go
for
beers
in
dfhs
massive
cache
of
spiced
ales
but
this
one
is
worth
trying
o
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
interesting
but
its
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
its
seemed
interesting
so
i
bought
it
but
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
it
reminds
me
of
what
an
exotic
perfume
would
taste
like
i
say
taste
because
this
doesnt
have
much
scent
to
it
o
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
to
taste
its
not
one
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
bunch
of
but
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
other
more
obscure
dogfish
brews
especially
their
ancient
ales
and
grapey
beers
it
will
take
me
a
little
while
to
drink
so
im
glad
i
recently
got
the
bottle
openersealer
to
keep
this
fresh
and
sudsy
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
a
hit
rather
than
miss
good
fruit
flavor
nice
spice
for
a
spiced
fruit
beer
its
very
good
the
body
manages
a
medium
fullness
it
develops
a
nice
creaminess
into
a
somewhat
drier
mildly
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
effervescent
overall
within
the
realm
of

is

very

really
enjoyed

always
make
for

ripping
good

jiahu
was

fun
didnt
we
have
one
hell
of
a
time
with

i
know
deep

be
the
jewel
in
any
serious

fine
layered
thin

aroma
has
an
upfront
tart
raisin
character
with
pomegranate
nutty
earthy
tones
with
a
sweet
floral
honey
aspect
to
it
pretty
awesome
historical
beers
brought
back
to
life
with
dogfish
head
baladin
and
birra
del

it
smells
like
pomegranate
honey
infused
jam
on
a
thick
crusted
artisan
bread
hints
of
spice
are
flowing
as
well
flavor
is
upfront
sweet
and
malty
with
extra
sugar
additions
adding
to
the
flow
of
sweetness
no
real
bittering
hops
that
are
mentioned
on
the
label
so
im
guessing
the
earthiness
from
the
myrrh
and
gentian
root
added
to
the
mix
of
help
balance
this
one
out
sweet
and
tart
qualities
arise
from
the
juicy
plump
raisin
to
the
tart
pomegranates
definitely
a
vinous
wine
like
quality
even
the
way
the
warmth
of
the
8
5
alcohol
hits
the
gut
and
the
palate
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
that
actually
works
together
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
lighter
carbonation
than
expected
working
toward
the
advantage
of
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
impression
is
that
i
like
it
and
im
glad
that
the
three
brewers
with
the
help
of
a
biomolecular
archaeologist
can
put
something
like
this
back
together
from
actual
ingredients
found
before
vino
arrived
in
italia
o
i
love
the
tartness
in
it
but
the
overdone
spices
slight
cloying
aspect
to
this
beer
is
over
the
top
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
spice
and
herb
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
fruit
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
not
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
ales
but
also
not
terrible
its
always
a
good
thing
to
at
least
try
each
beer
they
make
once
you
never
know
how
pleased
a
strange
beer
like
some
of
these
ancient
ales
will
make
you
o
earthy
fruity
perhaps
too
sweet
for
some
etrusca
is
interesting
the
hazelnut
flour
is
very
noticeable
in
the
finish
along
with
pomegranate
seeds
worth
a
try
though
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
buy
again
considering
the
high
price
overall
interesting
and
spicy
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
think
this
one
would
make
an
excellent
christmas
ale
but
like
many
christmas
ales
i
prefer
them
in
12
ounce
servings
but
whole
bombers
i
was
also
hoping
for
a
bit
more
pomegranate
and
hazelnut
flavors
both
of
which
are
hidden
behind
the
spiciness
glad
i
tried
this
but
once
is
good
by
me
o
an
interesting
beer
very
complex
and
interesting
flavors
tastes
to
be
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
its
somewhat
balanced
definitely
off
centered
so
i
shouldnt
be
too
surprised
but
it
might
be
a
bit
too
off
centered
for
many
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
it
has
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
which
in
the
end
work
out
rather
well
together
i
would
say
this
is
one
that
is
worth
a
try
as
it
is
quite
unique
and
complex
but
yet
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable
o
kind
of
what
i
expected
it
to
be
another
ancient
ale
that
i
dont
really
care
for
o
just
another
one
of
those
silly
ancient
ales
much
much
better
than
the
travesty
that
was
ta
drainpour
but
this
is
still
not
a
great
beer
i
might
be
tired
of
the
beer
history
lessons
because
ive
yet
to
have
one
of
these
beers
that
warrants
a
repeat
purchase
decent
enough
beer
but
just
wildly
confusing
in
all
aspects
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
it
has
way
too
many
things
going
on
for
my
palate
good
to
try
once
but
would
not
visit
it
again
overall
definitely
a
different
type
of
beer
taste
alone
reminds
you
maybe
something
from
belgium
this
brew
i
will
mind
you
is
not
for
everyone
you
have
to
have
an
open
mind
to
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
salud
it
has
an
aftertaste
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
ive
had
every
ancient
ale
except
ta
hanket
zero
interest
in
that
one
really
and
this
ranks
probably
the
low
middle
of
the
spectrum
of
those
releases
it
isnt
necessarily
bad
just
not
necessarily
great
i
am
glad
i
only
tried
a
small
snifter
and
did
not
pony
up
for
the
ridiculous
bomber
an
absolute
mess
and
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
has
any
resemblance
to
any
ancient
ale
just
a
waist
this
brew
blurs
the
beer
expectation
considerably
and
although
the
dfh
ancient
ales
havent
been
my
favorite
things
from
them
i
will
definitely
try
each
new
one
when
its
released
i
appreciate
the
efforts
and
the
history
cheers
d
definitely
interesting
and
unique
not
remotely
like
any
other
beers
ive
encountered
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
one
well
enough
but
im
not
quite
sure
it
is
something
that
i
would
seek
out
again
or
drink
with
regularity
i
would
recommend
for
those
seeking
out
an
experience
and
not
afraid
of
tying
truly
unique
brews
oanother
interesting
beer
from
dfh
nothing
great
but
im
glad
they
make
the
ancient
ales
o
its
the
best
of
both
wine
and
beer
in
one
bottle
hands
down
this
is
a
great
beer
to
taste
on
your
own
and
i
bet
this
would
spark
a
lively
debate
during
a
tasting
dogfish
nailed
it
with
this
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
the
time
i
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
dfh
brew
interestingly
enough
in
the
world
of
beer
wine
and
liquor
theres
not
much
that
reminds
me
of
this
as
much
as
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
which
is
of
course
the
first
beer
that
they
did
with
dr
pat
there
may
be
some
beers
that
come
close
and
perhaps
theres
a
bit
of
a
dry
red
wine
to
it
but
nothing
springs
to
mind
and
i
liked
the
midas
touch
2012
version
this
pours
a

brown
color
with

the
smells
are

herbal
liquids
the
beer
gives
off
some
spicy
herbal
notes
on
the
nose
along
with
some
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
malt
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
ranging
from
moderate
sweet
herbal
notes
to
some
dry
spices
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
typical
for
what
dfh
puts
out
old
bay
did
not
add
to
this
beer
but
rather
made
the
experience
just
a
little
off
pours
an
amber
color
nice
and
spicy
a
good
beer
to
have
after
a
seafood
dinner
on
the
beach
i
personally
was
hoping
for
more
old
bay
in
the
beer
but
im
an
outlier
the
fresher
beer
the
better
it
is
this
one
is
legendary
if
you
love
a
beer
with
a
kick
this
one
delivers
bruce
lee
and
some
traditional
maryland
old
bay
seasoning
keeps
this
beer
from
being
just
another
beer
definitely
recommend
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
totally
tastes
like
the
old
bay
seasoning
mix
and
boiled
crabs
i
bet
it
would
go
perfect
with
some
crab
cakes
a
crab
boilbake
some
peel
and
eat
shrimp
shrimp
and
grits
and
grilled
seafood
was
a
very
good
beer
very
refreshing
the
old
bay
seasoning
wasnt
over
powering
a
light
beer
for
the
summer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
consider
this
a
novelty
beer
was
curious
as
to
what
a
beer
would
taste
like
with
old
bay
spice
would
not
buy
again
this
came
out
in
june
and
here
it
is
december
so
that
6
months
may
have
taken
its
toll
because
im
not
getting
a
lot
out
of
this
the
taste
holds
up
to
the
sent
tastes
like
a
solid
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
which
obviously
comes
from
the
old
bay
the
old
bay
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
intense
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
perhaps
that
is
a
good
thing
on
its
own
it
is
a
decent
beer
when
paired
with
seafood
it
is
on
a
different
level
this
is
a
beer
that
is
definitely
meant
to
be
paired
rather
than
consumed
on
its
own
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
on
draft
at
an
md
crab
house
feasting
on
some
blue
crabs
where
this
beer
would
truly
shine
definitely
worth
a
try
and
would
have
again
with
the
right
food
pairing
really
good
nose
not
overpowering
but
definitely
reminiscent
of
a
family
crab
feast
very
clean
taste
and
a
wonderful
spicy
finish
i
love
this
beer
its
interesting
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
i
like
my
old
bay
on
my
blue
crabs
and
not
in
my
beer
what
a
unique
beer
if
the
thought
of
an
old
bay
flavored
beer
sounds
revolting
to
you
dont
worry
i
detected
no
salt
and
just
a
touch
of
celery
seed
the
hops
balance
extremely
well
with
the
spices
this
beer
has
a
flavor
quite
reminiscent
of
old
bay
while
still
being
thoroughly
drinkable
and
at
5
6
its
not
too
far
from
a
session
beer
and
it
benefits
marylands
blue
crabs
a
bonus
to
those
of
us
in
the
area
if
you
like
spiced
beers
like
witbiers
and
are
willing
to
go
a
bit
stronger
with
the
spices
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
over
a
decent
beer
it
does
go
great
with
blue
crabs
good
marketing
idea
check
maryland
pride
check
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
nope
o
it
really
went
well
with
the
seafood
at
dinner
which
was
prepared
in
a
very
simple
manner
a
very
nice
combination
of
old
bay
spice
and
the
hints
of
lemon
i
found
it
surprisingly
better
than
i
expected
hazy
yellow
gold
color
topped
with
a
thin
head
that
ultimately
shrinks
to
a
bubbly
covering
smells
spicy
and
festive
not
offensively
so
pretty
moderate
old
bay
like
aromas
flavor
is
also
spiced
as
expected
but
there
is
an
herbal
leafy
hop
presence
lemon
and
a
honeylike
pale
malt
sweetness
dry
crisp
medium
body
not
bad
although
the
spice
is
fairly
muted
it
does
begin
to
wear
on
the
palate
before
the
end
of
the
glass
great
if
you
love
old
bay
i
have
actually
added
more
old
pay
to
the
beer
by
covering
my
glass
rim
with
old
bay
mouthfeel
light
body
light
carbonation
the
pepper
leaves
a
kind
of
course
flavor
on
the
back
of
my
throat
and
top
of
my
mouth
the
lemon
flavors
leave
a
little
dryness
it
works
definitely
tastes
like
old
bay
and
the
super
bready
base
beer
complements
well
has
that
deep
breadiness
of
some
good
belgian
pales
or
brewpub
pilsners
if
that
makes
sense
i
like
it
this
is
my
frist
spice
beer
didnt
even
know
it
was
a
spice
beer
i
taste
pepper
look
good
in
a
glass
just
feels
like
my
mouth
is
burning
for
my
frisr
beer
of
this
kind
it
looks
so
good
in
a
glass
but
it
may
the
last
time
i
drink
one
of
these
beers
what
more
did
you
expect
out
of
this
one
my
initial
pour
created
two
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
nose
was
redolent
with
old
bay
r
and
my
mouth
instantly
began
to
water
color
was
a
pretty
yellowgold
srm
4
5
with
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
see
into
the
future
i
could
not
keep
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
with
this
one
this
would
be
fabulous
with
actual
crabs
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
if
it
is
intended
as
a
summer
ale
i
would
not
want
it
to
be
too
full
the
taste
was
of
old
bay
r
but
in
just
the
right
amount
not
overwhelming
which
it
could
have
been
how
do
you
describe
an
ale
brewed
with
spices
when
the
spices
are
so
variegated
you
almost
have
to
have
experienced
old
bay
r
seasoning
for
yourself
at
some
point
in
order
to
understand
one
point
that
really
needs
to
be
made
is
its
finish
just
like
any
other
beer
that
relies
heavily
on
spices
for
its
flavor
this
was
as
dry
as
the
desert
this
just
begs
to
be
drank
with
some
food
especially
seafood
say
salmon
sunday
is
tomorrow
o
a
nice
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
during
the
summer
i
love
summer
ales
so
i
may
be
partial
to
this
review
but
this
beer
is
worth
getting
and
is
the
best
crabspiced
beer
i
have
had
cheers
just
like
old
bay
potato
chips
only
better
seriously
though
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
something
that
i
would
expect
from
flying
dog
the
beer
itself
seems
to
be
pretty
good
hard
to
tell
with
the
spice
on
the
good
side
if
you
are
an
old
bay
fan
this
is
the
best
the
old
bay
flavor
is
just
right
and
not
too
overpowering
head
and
color
are
better
than
average
and
this
beer
would
be
awesome
on
a
summer
day
nice
and
cold
while
sitting
on
the
beach
or
pickin
crabs
lol
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
i
love
old
bay
but
i
was
still
pretty
skeptical
about
this
because
a
lot
of
flavored
beers
end
up
cloying
this
has
a
subtle
and
authentic
twist
added
to
what
i
suspect
would
be
a
pretty
good
pale
lager
without
it
surpassed
my
expectations
really
tasty
stuff
got
a
six
pack
to
try
as
i
like
crabs
and
old
bay
seasoning
sounded
strange
as
a
beer
flavor
but
this
really
works
if
you
like
old
bay
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
nice
summer
beer
hope
it
is
an
annual
brew
fellow
craft
beer
drinkers
in
the
family
agree
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
herb
spiced
beer
never
thought
old
bay
would
work
great
in
beer
and
this
is
pretty
tasty
stuff
o
pretty
much
what
one
would
expect
knowing
this
was
made
with
old
bay
seasoning
as
such
would
go
well
with
crab
shrimp
steak
etc
o
for
the
record
im
not
an
old
bay
fanatic
i
really
like
the
seasoning
but
im
not
one
of
those
fiends
who
thinks
spice
is
great
in
any
context
i
was
initially
skeptical
about
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
but
i
gotta
say
that
flying
dog
has
nailed
it
this
beer
pairs
well
with
tilapia
that
has
also
been
seasoned
with
old
bay
i
would
also
really
like
to
try
some
shrimp
tossed
in
old
bay
or
of
course
some
crab
and
old
bay
to
go
with
this
outstanding
mouthfeel
features
the
spiciness
on
the
tongue
in
an
otherwise
fairly
light
beer
i
had
this
with
snow
crab
legs
and
it
was
a
perfect
accompanyment
a
good
beer
with
sea
food
t
citrus
grapefruit
and
lemon
some
salt
and
pepper
notes
combine
with
faint
grass
for
dry
and
spicy
finish
some
sweet
notes
of
buttered
corn
that
one
would
expect
in
a
locountry
boil
really
nice
summertime
beer
can
be
hard
to
really
session
this
beer
out
as
the
spicing
does
start
to
overwhelm
o
yeah
its
not
good
sour
in
a
bad
way
i
could
finish
but
only
just
this
is
a
really
great
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
when
i
tried
thus
but
wow
what
a
surprise
this
is
a
really
great
pale
ale
with
a
distinct
old
bay
aroma
and
flavor
without
ovetpowering
fantastic
beeer
for
summerd
in
md
drinking
with
nma
he
just
got
here
after
a
long
drive
and
is
delusional
hence
the
low
numbers
great
summer
pale
beer
with
prominent
old
bay
spice
in
the
finish
that
stays
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
very
enjoyable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
plenty
of
these
throughout
the
summer
i
gotta
get
my
hands
on
some
of
these
and
take
them
back
to
ohio
the
taste
has
very
gentle
malt
presence
and
a
subtle
pepper
taste
w
a
mild
lemony
aspect
and
woody
sweet
element
with
the
malt
balanced
by
the
old
bay
and
hop
flavors
old
bay
spiciness
is
more
noticeable
in
the
finish
with
the
lingering
bitter
lemony
hop
flavor
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
a
very
nice
spice
edition
in
a
average
strength
pale
it
achieves
what
it
sets
out
to
do
prost
overall
a
surprisingly
good
summer
brew
not
over
the
top
with
spice
as
many
brewers
tend
to
do
dead
rise
became
famous
around
my
work
as
the
beer
with
the
crabby
stuff
in
it
but
after
trying
this
one
i
realized
it
was
no
joke
at
all
its
rich
complex
and
a
layered
wonderfully
the
appearance
of
it
is
pretty
standard
with
a
deep
gold
color
and
a
medium
bodied
head
when
i
took
my
first
smell
i
was
hit
with
the
old
bay
seasoning
right
away
it
was
buttery
and
sweet
with
a
good
kick
of
old
bay
at
the
end
nothing
too
overpowering
which
i
was
relieved
by
i
was
also
very
surprised
by
how
well
it
tasted
all
the
flavors
blended
together
wonderfully
and
gave
the
beer
a
great
layered
experience
first
you
get
a
sweet
buttery
flavor
quickly
followed
by
a
smooth
tone
of
old
bay
to
season
it
off
its
really
almost
the
full
experience
of
eating
maryland
blue
crabs
im
sure
md
locals
know
what
im
talking
about
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
was
afraid
the
old
bay
would
be
too
strong
and
overpower
the
beer
but
it
all
worked
out
wonderfully
to
me
this
tastes
like
leffe
blonde
if
i
had
it
at
a
crab
feast
like
almost
identical
but
a
slight
whiff
of
old
bay
and
a
subtle
burn
remains
on
my
tongue
when
it
is
gone
i
know
some
folks
hate
this
and
others
love
it
but
its
very
good
for
what
it
is
crystal
clear
and
great
smell
for
what
thats
worth
overall
it
is
what
it
is
a
old
bay
flavored
beer
nothing
complex
or
balanced
just
a
liquid
version
of
old
bay
with
minor
hops
and
malts
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
seafood
if
flying
dog
is
smart
theyd
work
out
a
exclusive
contract
with
red
lobster
joes
crab
etc
etc
to
feature
this
beer
at
these
places
if
youre
a
fan
of
old
bay
and
all
things
baltimore
chesapeake
bay
then
you
have
to
give
this
a
try
note
sure
i
would
opt
for
a
whole
case
unless
i
was
having
a
crab
boil
i
think
what
is
going
to
help
this
beer
out
a
lot
other
than
the
local
following
is
that
it
pairs
with
food
really
well
outdoor
bbq
smoked
ribs
the
other
wkd
served
with
this
brew
was
a
wonderful
combo
overall
i
guess
somebody
had
to
use
old
bay
in
a
beer
this
one
is
dead
rise
from
flying
dog
and
the
bottle
says
its
licensed
by
mccormick
to
use
old
bay
and
the
proceeds
benefit
true
blue
a
group
that
supports
the
maryland
blue
crab
industry
overall
not
wowed
and
not
feeling
bad
about
trying
this
its
just
making
me
want
to
get
some
all
you
can
eat
crab
legs
a
very
refreshing
brew
light
and
lemony
with
a
hint
of
salt
well
worth
buying
for
summer
yardwork
o
frederick
md
i
grew
up
18
miles
away
i
live
in
va
now
but
my
roots
there
run
deep
i
had
not
heard
of
dead
rise
before
my
sister
bought
me
a
pack
for
my
birthday
it
was
literally
released
a
few
weeks
ago
and
my
bottles
were
very
fresh
an
excellent
ale
would
go
great
with
a
crab
feast
the
old
bay
taste
is
mild
but
excellent
might
become
my
summer
go
to
beer
i
highly
recommend
its
a
winner
reminds
me
of
a
crab
boil
awesome
experiment
the
beer
is
true
to
what
it
claims
and
oh
god
i
cant
wait
to
eat
this
with
fresh
steamed
crabs
they
absolutely
nailed
the
right
amount
of
citrus
and
old
bay
character
on
this
its
a
perfect
seafood
beer
and
something
like
this
could
only
be
made
in
maryland
old
bay
spice
is
something
you
either
like
it
or
you
dont
and
i
am
drooling
over
this
this
brewery
is
going
to
easily
sell
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
even
saw
people
walking
out
with
cases
of
this
stuff
truly
the
perfect
beer
with
crabs
and
this
also
drinks
well
on
its
own
if
you
want
a
spiced
up
blonde
with
dry
salty
action
look
no
further
but
be
warned
its
not
for
everyone
but
this
makes
me
proud
to
be
living
in
maryland
i
was
very
excited
although
skeptical
to
try
this
but
it
works
so
well
if
you
love
old
bay
you
have
to
love
this
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
crabs
basically
skeptical
that
this
was
pure
marketing
hipsterfodder
the
brew
doesnt
fuck
around
promises
old
bay
and
delivers
better
than
ever
expected
surprisingly
evident
in
smell
and
taste
unlike
the
usual
disappointments
of
one
or
the
other
and
neither
would
i
have
it
again
probably
not
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
an
interesting
beer
not
in
your
face
with
the
old
bay
but
a
cross
between
a
summer
ale
and
old
bay
mission
accomplish
for
flying
dog
and
an
interesting
beer
but
nothing
i
would
really
seek
out
again
overall
not
my
favorite
style
too
farmhousey
but
a
decently
executed
beer
the
theme
is
too
gimmicky
for
me
though
even
though
i
am
a
born
and
bred
crabloving
marylander
old
bay
is
great
on
a
lot
of
things
but
doesnt
belong
onin
everything
o
its
a
weird
beer
to
be
sure
but
it
perfectly
encapsulates
maryland
in
a
glass
like
natty
boh
its
practically
law
to
have
this
one
while
eating
crabs
everyone
who
can
get
this
one
readily
should
at
least
try
it
once
o
buy
if
you
like
summer
and
the
eastern
shoreshellfish
very
good
beer
i
saw
it
as
a
natty
boh
ipa
which
is
a
very
high
compliment
for
a
beer
it
runs
smooth
with
a
swoosh
of
a
nice
slightly
hoppy
taste
with
a
smooth
slight
taste
of
old
bay
that
is
perfect
the
aftertaste
furthers
the
experience
as
well
i
hope
it
survives
the
summer
seasonal
phase
but
pick
it
up
while
you
can
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
know
tons
of
people
that
wont
like
this
beer
at
all
it
is
a
very
marylandeast
coast
style
taste
i
hope
flying
dog
releases
this
every
summer
as
i
could
see
it
being
a
great
beer
for
seafood
and
chicken
dishes
that
i
find
myself
enjoying
over
the
summer
months
cant
wait
to
have
a
crab
feast
with
a
six
pack
of
this
p
s
for
a
little
extra
spice
i
just
added
a
bit
of
old
bay
to
the
end
of
my
glass
and
gave
it
a
big
swirl
the
old
bay
really
sticks
to
the
foam
and
stays
at
the
top
however
it
goes
well
with
it
and
just
amps
up
the
already
present
flavors
it
was
ehhh
okay
not
what
was
expected
the
taste
of
ginger
is
so
strong
that
i
couldnt
really
enjoy
it
the
sweetness
was
overpowered
by
something
in
between
floral
and
sour
o
quite
good
could
benefit
from
a
tad
more
of
the
citrus
presence
in
the
beer
to
balance
it
out
it
is
very
interesting
and
different
definitely
worth
a
try
in
plain
words
this
is
very
good
overall
you
have
to
love
ginger
to
truly
appreciate
this
beer
i
happen
to
be
a
big
fan
of
ginger
which
is
why
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
it
gets
better
as
it
warmed
if
you
like
ginger
then
give
it
a
try
this
is
my
first
beer
from
kiuchi
brewery
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
them
enjoy
o
caramely
malt
and
powdered
ginger
are
core
to
the
taste
here
it
appears
that
it
could
be
a
goopy
mess
however
the
flavors
seem
to
have
decent
balance
and
it
thankfully
ends
up
surprisingly
dry
if
you
dig
malt
and
ginger
anything
this
is
a
good
one

o

beer
i
like
the
scent
and
flavor
profile
much
more
than
expected
and
will
probably
buy
again
a
passable
beer
with
a
subtle
ginger
flavor
certainly
less
aggressive
than
crabbies
more
of
a
novelty
beer
poured
a
cloudy
fresh
apple

with

funky
aromas
ginger
and
some
faint

and

sweetness
a
very
nice
earthy
fruity
and
sweet
aroma
with
some
unexpected
funk
far
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
very
nice
flavor
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
caramel
moves
into
some
white
grape
raisin
and
dried
fruit
apricot
and
apricot
pit
with
some
slight
spiciness
some
earthy
and
musty
yeast
flavors
coming
out
on
the

and
aftertaste
slight
sour
funkiness
and
some
slight
hints
of
ginger
in
the
background
in
the
middle
finish
and
aftertaste
very
good
the
ginger
is
not
as
big
in
the
flavor
as
i
expected
but
it
has
a
good
belgian
quality
to
the
flavor
with
some
wild
notes
and
the
spiciness
malty
sweetness
stone
fruit
and
dried
fruit
flavors
of
tripels
and
quads
quite
unique
and
very
good
the
flavor
hides
the
8
abv
entirely
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
that
barely
pricks
the
tongue
yet
enough
to
give
the
beer
a
sipping
quality
there
is
also
a
slight
creaminess
in
the
feel
very
nice
to
drink
and
swish
excellently
crafted
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
went
in
expecting
a
ginger
heavy
gimmick
but
got
a
good
belgianlike
beer
with
a
surprising
complexity
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
ginger
its
a
well
crafted
beer
showing
the
brewers
care
for
the
final
product
highly
recommended
this
beer
has
a
huge
head
when
first
poured
and
lacing
remains
throughout
nice
reddish
caramel
color
there
is
some
dark
sediment
that
comes
out
at
the
end
of
the
pour
you
can
really
smell
the
ginger
and
taste
it
as
well
nice
spicy
finish
from
the
ginger
without
being
harsh
due
to
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
if
you
like
ginger
this
is
the
beer
for
you
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
true
rendition
of
the
ginger
flavor
but
this
one
hits
it
on
the
spot
this
is
what
a
true
ginger
beer
should
be
the
abv
of
8
also
gives
you
a
nice
double
whammy
when
combined
with
the
ginger
o
i
am
a
fan
of
the
korean
candy
yeot
so
i
couldnt
get
that
thought
out
of
my
head
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
kiuchi
brewery
has
once
again
won
me
over
will
i
drink
it
again
absolutely
overall
ok
its
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
but
its
a
decently
interesting
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
more
exotic
brews
otherwise
probably
not
worth
your
time
o
polarized
beer
very
good
parts
and
pretty
bad
parts
pours
a
fairly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
ginger
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
subdued
ginger
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
ginger
that
is
present
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
fairly
underwhelming
in
my
opinion
o
decent
ginger
beer
i
think
the
beer
aspect
could
be
improved
but
i
enjoyed
the
ginger
character
a
lot
more
in
the
final
product
than
other
ginger
beers
ive
had
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
during
hitachino
tasting
2013
nice
brownish
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
ginger
and
sugary
dried
fruit
aroma
actually
quite
nice
taste
is
ginger
and
belgian
dark
quad
like
dried
fruit
a
bit
the
ginger
is
much
stronger
in
the
aroma
than
the
taste
its
actually
a
good
brew
o
it
is
solid
it
has
a
unique
taste
definitely
worth
a
try
but
cant
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
i
enjoyed
overall
i
admittedly
havent
had
any
other
ginger
beer
so
this
was
interesting
id
probably
order
this
if
i
was
getting
sushi
although
i
paid
almost
5
for
a
12oz
bottle
so
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
overall
its
kind
of
interesting
but
i
am
not
exactly
keen
on
this
one
jury
out
its
not
beer
just
not
as
we
know
it
have
to
say
would
not
buy
again
o
another
interesting
attempt
at
a
ginger
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
hitachino
offering
and
probably
not
something
i
would
have
again
an
interesting
and
different
ale
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
strikes
me
as
something
that
might
pair
well
with
certain
savory
foods
on
its
own
might
be
a
little
too
weird
to
warrant
a
second
try
for
most
but
i
am
personally
happy
drinking
it
the
first
time
at
least
given
the
name
of
the
beer
was
real
ginger
brew
i
was
expecting
a
more
gingerforward
flavor
in
truth
it
did
have
notifiable
ginger
flavor
but
if
you
are
expecting
something
akin
to
ginger
beer
soda
then
you
will
be
disappointed
the
color
was
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
light
foamy
head
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
but
i
would
probably
not
pay
the
more
than
5
per
12oz
bottle
that
i
did
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
o
i
bought
two
of
these
and
had
one
with
dinner
which
was
japanese
pepper
steak
and
one
by
itself
to
test
its
worth
personally
i
thought
it
went
nice
with
dinner
and
by
itself
id
come
back
to
this
if
i
can
find
it
cheaper
because
the
price
was
4
59
for
a
12
oz
bottle
yikes
dark
murky
amber
body
with
a
huge
finger
of
yellowish
head
the
nose
has
as
a
mild
ginger
spice
and
a
mild
hop
up
front
with
a
few
roasted
aromas
as
well
the
first
sip
is
rather
sweet
with
big
caramel
and
candied
ginger
with
light
citrus
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
somewhat
warming
now
realize
its
8
overall
well
balanced
and
tasty
for
sure
rather
sweet
and
spicy
but
that
was
probably
expected
descent
ginger
brew
would
appreciate
a
little
less
sugary
flavor
and
feel
so
the
ginger
character
can
show
through
appearance
is
brown
and
amber
but
most
notable
is
the
unfiltered
cloudy
appearance
head
is
present
at
pour
but
disappates
quickly
to
just
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
unique
ginger
banana
clove
other
fruits
maybe
some
candied
dates
and
the
taste
is
the
star
ive
tried
other
ginger
beers
and
find
the
ginger
hard
to
pick
out
not
so
in
this
beer
well
done
the
ginger
is
present
from
start
to
finish
finally
a
ginger
beer
that
meets
expectations
of
having
that
flavor
other
spices
and
some
malty
breadiness
to
the
flavor
not
as
offensive
in
the
ginger
department
as
i
had
feared
with
all
the
flavours
coming
out
well
balanced
and
making
a
refreshing
beer
as
a
result
o
the
ginger
is
not
overdone
as
is
easy
to
do
with
this
style
pleasant
and
refreshing
while
being
a
fairly
big
brew
a
nice
slant
on
the
style
more
ginger
in
the
flavours
but
not
dominant
theres
also
some
faint
bready
malt
a
bit
of
herbal
astringency
shows
later
the
base
beer
doesnt
seem
that
great
o
overall
this
was
a
relatively
disappointing
beer
from
hitachino
way
too
malty
for
my
tastes
with
not
enough
bold
ginger
waste
of
money
for
the
price
o
very
enjoyable
but
slightly
too
gingery
and
too
strong
in
abv
to
be
sessionable
this
beer
paired
very
nicely
with
my
sushi
dinner
and
is
definitely
one
that
i
would
have
another
time
original
review
on
09212010
overall
an
unexpectedly
delicious
and
certainly
unusually
caressing
gingerinfused
brew
theres
something
utterly
unique
about
it
but
also
utterly
disarming
about
it
although
almost
everything
about
it
is
unexpected
youre
happy
to
let
it
do
what
it
needs
to
do
an
unexpectedly
pleasant
experience
cheers
o
kiuchi
is
by
far
my
favorite
brewery
even
though
i
didnt
think
id
care
much
for
a
ginger
beer
once
again
the
hitachino
nest
series
pulls
through
and
puts
forth
a
winner
absolutely
great
bottle
copper
color
offwhite
head
quickly
fades
great
aroma
lots
of
fresh
ginger
with
dandelion
and
wildflower
citrus
zest
caramel
in
the
malt
medium
to
full
slick
body
with
light
bubbles
on
the
tongue
lots
more
ginger
with
grass
and
wildflowers
in
the
flavor
great
malt
balance
in
behind
with
citrus
zest
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
good
stuff
i
love
nonalcoholic
ginger
beers
so
thought
i
should
give
this
guy
a
chance
pours
a
very
hazy
orangeyellow
color
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
ginger
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
has
that
ginger
kick
for
sure
but
the
sweet
malts
caramel
and
sugar
really
dont
work
with
the
ginger
kick
theres
some
other
spices
in
here
that
also
kinda
muddle
the
whole
thing
it
works
but
could
be
a
bit
better
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
strangely
drying
on
the
finish
its
almost
like
my
tongue
is
dry
but
my
throat
is
still
wet
overall
it
was
an
alright
beer
but
as
a
huge
ginger
fan
i
really
wanted
more
this
may
be
the
best
ginger
beer
on
the
market
beer
is
light
in
body
sweet
and
spicy
the
ginger
comes
through
nicely
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
but
not
too
bad
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
this
brewery
makes
better
beers
and
ive
had
them
taste
is
very
interesting
the
hops
and
ginger
blend
and
increase
the
power
of
the
bitterness
a
nice
malty
backbone
to
balance
the
flavors
a
very
assertive
beer
with
probably
the
best
ginger
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
be
prepared
for
some
deep
and
strong
flavor
if
you
like
sushi
ginger
youll
enjoy
trying
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
offwhite
head
with
good
staying
power
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
spicing
nothing
too
overthetop
flavor
has
a
bit
of
light
malty
sweetness
along
with
plenty
of
cinnamon
could
be
a
pumpkin
beer
or
a
winter
warmer
hard
to
distinguish
with
strong
cinnamon
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
backing
lightmedium
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
fizz
dry
o
very
quaffable
but
not
all
that
outstanding
in
expression
of
flavor
not
worth
the
price
these
beers
have
become
very
expensive
in
the
last
two
years
overall
unique
infusion
of
ingredients
well
complemented
very
drinkable
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
ginger
beer
you
could
do
much
worse
because
this
offering
has
the
ginger
without
being
a
bummer
to
drink
and
that
makes
it
okay
in
my
book
overall
4
the
smell
and
look
are
great
for
a
ginger
beer
and
the
taste
is
bangon
the
goal
couple
this
with
some
sushi
and
you
have
the
perfect
match
im
struggling
to
place
this
as
a
refreshing
or
savory
beer
likely
because
its
a
bit
of
both
depending
on
when
youre
drinking
it
well
ginger
in
many
if
not
most
of
its
forms
pervades
this
offering
and
despite
its
inconsistencies
which
seem
sort
of
endearing
at
times
this
would
kick
ass
on
the
usual
sapporo
or
kirin
lager
options
at
each
and
every
sushi
joint
on
the
planet
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
than
i
would
have
initially
imagined
for
once
the
taste
didnt
mimic
the
smell
interesting
stuff
and
i
feel
i
should
powering
back
unagi
and
ebi
with
a
california
roll
on
the
side
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
full
bomber
bottle
is
tough
to
manage
singlehandedly
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ginger
brews
that
i
have
tasted
though
if
you
want
that
sweet
candied
ginger
character
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
this
tastes
like
the
ginger
you
get
at
sushi
restaurants
yum
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
copper
gold
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
it
had
some
subtle
malts
with
a
touch
of
ginger
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
slightly
sweet
herbal
spice
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
lighter
bodied
with
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
my
boyfriend
and
i
both
really
enjoyed
itnot
what
we
were
expecting
from
a
ginger
beer
surprised
us
and
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
will
be
buying
again
a
nice
hazy
brown
body
with
a
thin
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
minimum
lacing
nose
is
spicy
ginger
cinnamon
and
bread
malts
taste
is
big
spicy
ginger
crackers
and
a
nice
hop
bite
with
a
dry
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
to
low
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
interesting
and
definitely
worth
the
try
as
a
one
off
if
i
can
get
another
bottle
ill
rereview
the
one
drawback
is
that
its
a
tad
expensive
at
10
a
bomber
nothing
terrible
though
and
if
they
really
just
wanted
to
make
a
very
ginger
tasting
beer
id
say
their
execution
was
flawless
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
ginger
and
a
beer
and
want
to
knock
out
two
birds
with
one
stone
this
is
your
beer
mmm
better
than
i
anticipated
poured
with
a
large
foamy
thick
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
settled
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
brownish
amber
with
lots
of
flecks
of
stuff
and
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
and
spice
flavor
is
like
nose
with
a
little
sweetness
and
ginger
showing
up
more
the
carbonic
tang
perfectly
offsets
the
sweetness
and
ginger
body
and
carb
are
decent
finish
is
like
flavor
and
about
medium
in
length
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
o
herbed
or
spiced
beers
are
frequently
considered
novelty
beers
it
is
true
that
this
beer
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
color
but
it
is
not
brewed
for
kicks
and
giggles
the
sweetness
and
spice
of
the
ginger
work
together
to
create
a
beer
that
has
balance
the
beer
can
feel
a
little
heavy
slight
syrup
i
wish
it
has
higher
carbonation
o
tastes
a
lot
like
a
heavier
sweeter
ginger
ale
not
bad
really
i
was
expecting
a
lighter
crisper
beer
but
this
did
just
fine
worth
trying
and
ill
get
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
d
i
could
absolutely
drink
this
beer
all
night
if
you
enjoy
a
hoppy
beer
this
would
be
enjoyable
because
ginger
adds
spicy
hopesque
kick
those
are
my
initial
opinions
at
first
couple
tastes
but
after
attempting
the
whole
bottle
the
ginger
was
a
bit
too
much
and
overpowering
hard
to
finish
not
something
to
drink
more
of
a
glass
of
pours
a
murky
dark
burnt
amber
color
soapy
white
head
gone
quickly
first
whiff
prongs
some
spicy
ginger
notes
but
quickly
covered
up
by
a
stong
malt
sweetness
quite
corn
syrupy
taste
comes
through
with
stong
notes
of
spicy
ginger
the
sweetness
cuts
through
at
the
end
and
takes
over
a
touch
less
ginger
and
more
then
a
touch
less
sweetness
would
improve
this
beer
medium
bodied
slightly
chewy
lingering
spicyness
i
liked
this
but
10oz
should
be
enough
a
beer
with
the
strongest
ginger
profile
i
have
had
but
the
7
abv
gives
hint
to
the
amount
of
malts
used
in
this
all
while
residual
sweetness
takes
over
the
palate
o
nothing
special
here
ginger
is
lacking
the
punch
i
was
looking
for
and
the
base
beer
really
is
pretty
nondescript
for
me
a
bit
malty
not
much
for
hops
ginger
is
a
let
down
just
ok
overall
pretty
expensive
12oz
experience
at
6
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
having
my
doubts
about
the
other
bottle
of
hitachino
nest
beer
i
bought
o
i
liked
this
because
of
the
creamy
malt
factor
kudos
to
kiuchi
brewery
for
always
trying
to
do
something
interesting
but
the
sweet
notes
seemed
slightly
unnatural
but
i
think
i
can
get
past
that
this
would
pair
well
with
wagu
beef
or
bulgoki
d
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
worth
a
try
but
once
for
a
beer
labeled
real
ginger
id
expect
more
of
a
spicy
presence
hard
to
pick
it
out
although
it
did
assert
itself
more
as
the
beer
warmed
was
expecting
much
much
more
from
this
one
the
aroma
was
of
sugars
and
syrup
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
great
color
and
nice
head
which
settled
down
so
a
nice
thin
ring
around
the
surface
i
cant
think
of
anything
to
pair
with
it
so
itll
probably
be
a
drain
pour
will
think
about
trying
this
one
again
if
i
know
its
a
fresher
batch
which
may
not
be
for
a
while
the
shop
i
purchased
this
from
often
has
outdated
brews
on
the
shelves
i
like
the
attempt
here
but
the
flavor
is
kind
of
all
over
as
mentioned
before
unique
for
sure
but
i
wont
need
to
have
this
one
again
personally
this
beer
pours
ruby
red
with
some
hanging
sediment
a
thin
head
that
dies
down
to
nothing
and
no
lace
on
the
nose
the
ginger
hits
hardest
and
first
but
underneath
that
are
some
subtle
fruit
aromas
in
the
mouth
the
ginger
is
less
assertive
that
i
thought
a
good
thing
and
there
are
some
fruit
notes
i
think
one
reviewer
mentioned
watermelon
and
that
doesnt
sound
outrageous
to
me
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
out
the
individual
flavors
underneath
the
ginger
which
kind
of
covered
everything
for
me
the
body
is
pretty
light
but
the
ginger
sticks
around
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
for
some
time
i
guess
i
just
dont
like
ginger
or
at
least
in
beers
for
someone
who
does
this
may
be
a
better
brew
first
sip
is
a
bit
more
citruslike
than
i
expected
it
would
be
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
i
would
agree
that
its
pretty
rewarding
overall
flavor
and
consistency
mirror
that
of
some
beers
made
with
wild
yeasts
and
as
those
are
some
of
my
favorite
i
would
contest
that
this
might
end
up
on
the
top
of
your
list
im
not
into
this
one
glad
i
only
bought
the
one
bottle
out
of
curiosity
of
all
the
hitachino
nest
offerings
the
lcbo
could
have
brought
in
why
did
they
choose
this
one
d
i
liked
the
balance
in
the
herbal
character
which
was
not
overwhelming
drank
decent
and
was
a
decent
herbal
brew
drinkability
not
a
great
drinker
a
little
too
herby
mouthfeel
with
smooth
light
and
crisp
with
light
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
sensation
overall
low
drinkability
this
was
a
nice
experiment
but
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
disappointed
with
this
everything
seems
out
of
balance
verdict
quite
nice
unique
and
refreshing
too
expensive
but
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
japanese
beer
provides
me
with
happy
memories
of
vacations
past
and
its
easy
for
me
to
look
at
them
with
rosetinted
glasses
but
i
believe
this
is
the
real
deal
an
ode
to
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
tuberous
roots
d
the
beer
clears
your
palate
and
is
quite
refreshing
hazy
reddish
brown
color
nice
cream
colored
head
head
holding
nicely
has
an
almost
belgiany
aroma
that
is
most
likely
the
spice
replicating
yeast
esters
i
like
how
this
is
still
a
delicious
malty
flavored
beer
with
inclusion
of
ginger
the
base
of
the
beer
would
be
delicious
without
the
ginger
addition
which
works
quite
well
ion
the
brew
just
a
hint
of
ginger
at
the
end
of
the
sip
with
the
bitterness
i
really
like
this
beer
best
ginger
beer
i
have
ever
had
biterness
and
abv
work
well
together
tastes
fresh
for
japanese
beer
i
am
quite
happy
with
the
purchase
a
very
interesting
beer
i
would
not
have
expected
it
to
be
as
dark
and
malt
heavy
as
it
was
it
certainly
works
well
the
ginger
standing
up
well
to
the
richness
of
the
malt
quite
enjoyable
is
added
to
the
aroma
as
beer
warms
average
carbonation
light
in
finish
very
drinkable
color
clears
as
it
warms
spiciness
also
nellies
out
with
warmth
breadiness
and
alcohol
increase
slightly
with
warmth
still
very
good
all
in
all
its
worth
trying
but
im
not
sure
id
buy
another
bottle
as
a
side
note
something
about
that
bizzare
orange
cartoon
owl
on
the
bottle
creeps
me
out
for
some
reason
its
like
his
unrelenting
steady
gaze
slowly
bores
into
my
soul
it
wouldnt
stop
me
from
buying
it
again
but
for
some
reason
it
seems
unsettling
overall
this
is
decent
ginger
brew
and
hopefully
only
a
sneak
peak
into
more
craft
beers
from
japan
would
be
best
paired
with
food
but
on
its
own
its
still
a
treat
could
have
a
few
in
a
session
somewhat
creamy
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
obviously
im
not
going
to
find
this
one
very
drinkable
id
be
open
to
sampling
other
offerings
from
the
brewery
but
this
particular
beer
just
isnt
for
me
stronger
than
the
other
ginger
beer
i
have
had
while
the
other
one
i
found
somewhat
sessionable
this
one
while
enjoyable
feels
more
like
it
needs
a
food
accompaniment
certainly
smells
a
bit
gingery
pours
a
chill
hazed
amber
with
an
average
sized
but
impeccably
creamy
head
nose
has
ginger
of
course
and
hints
of
honey
a
bit
of
a
spicy
flavour
and
very
dry
gingery
bitterness
does
that
make
sense
and
bit
of
a
husky
grain
round
out
the
flavours
not
a
lot
of
acidity
and
did
i
mention
very
dry
moderate
body
but
sharp
carbonation
and
ok
drinkability
maybe
a
bit
of
novelty
here
but
not
much
else
and
yet
its
still
a
beer
rice
and
thick
bitter
barley
dominate
the
back
end
along
with
zippy
yeast
and
pleasant
alcohol
burn
this
is
maybe
a
bit
too
thick
seeing
as
the
opening
end
is
more
like
a
nice
old
timey
cough
drop
nice
to
see
a
ginger
beer
that
is
big
enough
to
work
with
the
ginger
flavour
and
make
it
food
friendly
darkish
ale
with
lots
of
ginger
but
a
goodly
amount
of
hops
and
malt
to
back
it
up
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
but
as
ginger
beers
go
this
is
pretty
good
d
i
can
see
why
not
everyone
would
like
this
but
to
me
it
is
a
gem
i
find
its
challenges
if
well
met
are
worthwhile
like
a
young
art
student
she
will
break
your
heart
and
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
you
may
not
marry
her
but
you
will
sleep
with
her
again
given
the
right
circumstances
certainly
a
specialty
beer
to
pair
with
the
right
dish
mood
but
a
good
drink
for
the
right
person
looking
for
something
different
overall
an
interesting
brew
definitely
a
firm
solid
brew
best
suited
for
working
at
slowly
while
sitting
in
your
favorite
comfy
chair
id
do
this
one
again
d
tasty
but
ive
had
better
i
wouldnt
consider
myself
a
connoiseur
of
the
style
however
i
wouldve
liked
something
with
a
little
more
ginger
this
was
very
well
done
and
is
easily
the
best
ginger
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
will
be
very
excited
to
try
it
with
asian
dishes
made
with
ginger
but
also
burgers
steak
roast
beef
and
sharp
cheeses
will
work
fabulously
with
this
fascinating
and
enjoyable
beer
d
i
love
ginger
i
love
cooking
with
it
i
love
eating
it
i
love
drinking
it
just
really
not
loving
drinking
this
one
halfway
through
the
drink
down
the
drain
it
went
despite
the
weird
disconnect
between
the
nose
tongue
and
mouth
this
beer
was
remarkably
average
not
offensive
but
nothing
worth
wasting
ones
time
drinking
imo
sorry
for
the
short
review
but
id
rather
not
waste
my
time
or
creative
energy
bsing
about
this
would
not
drink
again
unless
other
available
brews
are
few
and
far
between
notes
meh
ginger
beer
wish
it
was
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
good
full
and
smooth
with
tiny
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
the
beer
goes
down
well
and
another
would
be
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
lightmedium
body
that
finishes
clean
the
tartness
makes
this
a
refreshing
summer
beer
even
at
7
abv
hitachino
nest
real
ginger
brew
is
a
hazy
amber
in
colour
topped
by
an
insubstantial
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
lace
the
glass
it
has
an
intense
ginger
aroma
over
a
biscuity
malt
background
effectively
making
it
smell
like
ginger
snap
cookies
the
ginger
is
tastes
less
intense
than
it
smells
but
manages
to
give
the
beer
a
mildly
spicy
flavour
that
is
complemented
by
some
sweet
caramel
and
honey
finishes
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
smooth
but
not
heavy
as
far
as
beer
brewed
with
ginger
goes
this
isnt
as
complex
as
albino
python
from
schmaltz
brewing
nice
beer
with
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
ginger
flavours
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
not
something
i
would
be
naturally
drawn
to
but
i
am
struck
by
how
well
integrated
the
ginger
is
and
how
surprisingly
drinkable
it
is
for
a
maltheavy
ginger
beer
dthe
higher
abv
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
i
might
get
tired
of
the
ginger
after
about
4
or
5
though
i
think
this
beer
might
be
better
served
colder
mine
sat
in
the
freezer
for
about
10
min
so
it
was
only
slightly
chilled
i
simply
feel
that
ginger
lends
itself
more
to
lighter
beers
give
me
a
ginger
infused
hefe
or
nice
refreshing
pale
its
an
interesting
beer
but
is
out
of
place
in
the
lcbo

a
medium

with
good

and
some
lacing

of
deep
caramel
malt
and
toffee
with
some
very
subtle
ginger
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
caramel
malt
with
sweet
toffee
notes
while
ginger
is
hidden
quite
well
in
this
whole
mix
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
some
average
carbonation
not
bad
overall
but
i
was
expecting
a
beer
more
focus
toward
ginger
then
strong
caramel
malt
hitachino
nests
real
ginger
brew
is
a
very
likable
and
appreciably
unique
offering
but
now
having
tried
an
alcoholic
asian
ginger
beer
i
can
say
for
certain
that
i
prefer
the
caribbeanstyle
nonalcohol
version
and
that
when
it
comes
to
incorporating
ginger
into
the
gastronomic
realm
i
prefer
it
best
in
cookie
form
or
with
seafood
or
meat
a
world
class
specialty
beer
well
carried
off
substantial
and
deeply
flavorful
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
even
if
i
dont
love
how
the
ginger
builds
and
dominates
with
every
sip
its
definitely
not
one
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
well
done

wish
i
it
was
a
bit
more
subtle
honestly
maybe
the
worstlooking
brew
ive
ever
had
sure
some
beers
have
sediment
but
this
just
looks
a
bit
nasty
with
the
color
and
cloudiness
the
flavor
doesnt
particularly
strike
me
as
ginger
for
some
reason
more
herbal
for
the
very
curious
only
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
value
4
89
for
11
2
oz
i
kinda
expensive
also
my
expectations
for
hitachino
nest
were
extremely
high
because
of
their
absolutely
phenomenal
white
ale
i
have
no
constructive
criticism
on
how
to
make
this
beer
better
but
i
would
like
to
see
something
else
happen
here
well
doesnt
really
taste
like
ginger
but
something
is
going
on
that
i
dont
recognize
that
must
be
ginger
mmm
ginger
d
would
be
much
higher
if
the
ginger
werent
so
dominant
the
beer
gushes
out
the
top
when
opened
and
then
pours
a
murky
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
lemon
with
some
nice
malt
and
brett
character
the
flavor
is
very
tart
with
some
brett
funk
as
well
as
some
lemons
and
oranges
tart
funky
finish
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
not
the
simplistic
beer
i
thought
it
could
be
this
will
demand
a
bit
of
your
time
and
attention
overall
i
really
like
this
why
am
i
always
surprised
that
i
like
a
hitachino
nest
beer
i
should
know
better
by
now
this
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
a
ring
of
lacingthe
aroma
is
suprisngly
not
full
on
ginger
which
i
was
expecting
with
a
ginger
beer
its
more
sweetish
like
candied
ginger
and
boiled
candyit
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
sweet
boiled
candyfruity
hops
and
a
little
ginger
kick
but
by
no
means
overpowering
in
fact
the
ginger
in
my
mind
plays
a
nice
cohost
in
this
brew
to
accomodate
the
other
flavours
while
still
displaying
the
ginger
qualities
even
though
its
a
real
ginger
beer
almost
like
a
beautiful
curry
which
has
ginger
in
it
but
does
not
overpower
the
other
flavours
and
still
shows
its
qualitiesoverall
a
tasty
brew
and
even
if
your
not
a
fan
of
ginger
dont
let
the
label
scare
you
as
its
more
a
brew
with
ginger
in
it
than
a
ginger
beer
notes
nice
surprise
from
the
hitachino
beer
typically
very
nice
brews
but
this
one
was
something
else
sure
one
needs
to
like
ginger
to
enjoy
this
one
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
and
in
fact
works
well
as
a
rich
malty
complex
brew
with
a
long
finish
i
think
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
want
to
pair
it
with
food
rather
than
drink
by
itself
would
pair
well
with
sushi
maybe
some
noodle
dishes
overall
its
a
solid
brew
and
unusual
really
liked
the
added
ginger
which
is
thinking
outside
of
the
box
and
when
your
thinking
outside
the
box
im
all
for
it
maybe
not
for
everyone
as
i
can
see
that
ginger
and
sour
wouldnt
go
over
well
in
some
crowds
but
if
your
looking
out
of
the
ordinary
give
it
a
shot
d
this
is
a
ridiculously
good
beer
i
think
if
it
were
brewed
by
monks
in
belgium
it
would
probably
be
exalted
overall
a
subtle
spiced
ale
nice
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
was
surprised
from
the
start
as
a
big
foamy
head
greeted
me
before
i
could
even
start
pouring
once
poured
the
head
stays
bubbly
and
lacy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
rusty
orange
color
and
you
can
see
big
chunks
of
sediment
resting
on
the
bottom
the
smell
is
unsurprisingly
of
ginger
with
some
citrusy
notes
that
actually
remind
me
of
a
weizen
or
belgian
blonde
the
taste
is
where
things
really
get
interesting
the
ginger
is
predominant
but
acidic
sweet
fruity
malts
and
hops
follow
after
again
im
amazed
how
much
this
tastes
like
other
styles
lambics
bdsas
weizens
and
wittes
are
all
represented
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
effortless
which
is
good
because
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
to
process
if
you
had
handed
me
a
glass
of
this
stuff
without
telling
me
where
it
came
from
i
would
have
immediately
guessed
that
it
was
belgian
or
a
northeastern
american
micro
im
absolutely
floored
that
it
came
from
japan
aka
beer
hell
and
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
and
try
another
brew
from
hitachino
this
is
my
second
beer
from
this
producer
and
i
havent
been
disappointed
yet
only
surprised
in
both
cases
i
havent
had
very
many
ginger
brews
but
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
ones
i
have
had
i
have
had
left
hand
juju
ginger
and
dogfish
head
pangaea
both
of
which
were
rather
disappointing
this
has
a
more
full
and
complex
flavor
to
it
definetly
worth
checking
out
d
an
interesting
and
weird
brew
the
ginger
may
be
over
the
top
for
me
but
it
doesnt
dominate
the
brew
entirely
unique
its
a
beer
thats
hard
to
quantify
definitely
not
for
everybody
avoid
it
tries
but
certainly
fails
hitachino
nest
ginger
brew
is
a
translucent
but
not
at
all
transparent
orangish
red
ale
its
very
sparkling
with
lots
of
particles
it
has
a
thick
multicolored
head
marbled
from
white
to
rusty
brown
its
dense
with
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
there
is
a
lot
of
dirty
ginger
in
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
it
has
a
very
fluffy
medium
body
thats
very
smooth
with
a
sharp
slightly
gritty
finish
theres
not
really
any
sweetness
its
tangy
the
ginger
is
pretty
prominent
but
not
dominant
its
tangy
leathery
belgianlike
almost
salty
its
very
unique
this
bottle
was
bought
maybe
six
months
ago
there
was
a
ginger
ginsing
aroma
whafting
from
the
mushroom
cloud
head
on
a
dark
yellow
body
but
the
taste
was
a
skunky
medicine
disasterit
had
an
stringent
finish
medium
mouthfeeland
really
not
too
drinkable
overall
decent
but
not
flavorful
enough
a
rather
herbal
amber
ale
that
comes
out
sweet
nose
of
ginger
not
ginger
powder
a
sweetness
that
is
similar
to
that
of
pickled
ginger
not
palate
is
milder
ginger
astringent
than
expected
has
a
sweet
caramel
with
a
mild
warm
from
the
ginger
and
somewhat
the
alcohol
also
sort
of
hard
to
tell
ginger
is
definitely
not
as
punchy
as
expected
hitachino
is
interesting
and
refreshingly
unique
but
hardly
easy
to
consume
definitely
have
this
with
subtleflavored
foods
notes
overall
this
beer
is
very
interesting
with
many
layers
of
complexity
this
is
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
something
different
maybe
odd
and
defiantly
special
normally
dont
like
ginger
flavor
beers
but
in
this
case
the
ginger
flavor
is
nicely
integrated
into
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
nice
beer
d
great
both
refreshing
and
flavorful
a
multi
purpose
beer
would
be
great
with
sushi
or
pork
dishes
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
spicy
fresh
ginger
aroma
that
blends
well
with
the
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
thick
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
sweet
with
a
spicy
ginger
character
there
is
a
mild
tartness
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
decent
ginger
brew
its
quite
prevelant
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
just
not
sure
that
i
like
the
style
that
much
eric
taste
is
tangy
lots
of
ginger
tangerine
tart
on
the
tongue
and
some
hops
ends
a
little
bitter
and
tart
the
ginger
and
spice
are
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
is
hard
to
ignore
the
bitterness
that
seems
a
little
unablanced
and
at
times
overpowering
d
i
dont
know
if
this
is
really
something
to
be
consumed
all
that
often
but
its
worth
a
shot
its
probably
food
friendly
i
cant
get
over
the
syrup
i
get
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
this
brew
has
a
bit
too
much
ginger
flavor
in
my
opinion
and
i
really
like
ginger
its
also
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
just
wish
it
was
slightly
more
complex
with
other
flavors
d
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
not
one
id
come
back
to
time
and
again
still
like
most
hitachino
products
its
a
well
made
beer
i
want
to
give
this
beer
a
better
grade
for
the
effort
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
had
trouble
finishing
it
its
just
too
damn
sweet
im
glad
for
having
tried
it
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
mfd
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
though
i
agree
with
the
brewer
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
drinking
a
ginger
slurpee
i
think
a
bit
more
carbonation
or
viscosity
would
have
done
well
to
make
the
beer
pack
a
bigger
concentrated
ginger
punch
the
drink
ability
however
is
great
as
it
is
for
if
it
were
to
get
a
heavier
body
then
it
wouldnt
be
quite
as
light
and
refreshing
thus
we
have
a
paradox
d
refreshing
and
tasty
beverage
all
around
abv
well
hidden
almost
like
a
soda
note
five
minutes
after
trying
the
ginger
is
starting
to
come
through
with
a
slight
burn
much
like
after
having
ginger
with
sushi
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
would
be
great
for
an
asian
night
or
any
night
you
are
feeling
adventurous
if
you
see
it
grab
it
first
sip
was
very
gingery
then
all
i
could
taste
was
sweet
vermouth
that
flavor
got
stronger
the
more
the
beer
warmed
all
i
could
think
was
that
i
was
drinking
a
huge
glass
of
sweet
vermouth
herbs
and
spices
and
faint
sweetness
with
a
puckering
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
my
thing
exactly
i
guess
if
you
like
sweet
vermouth
i
mean
really
like
sweet
vermouth
youll
dig
this
d
i
could
have
a
couple
but
i
dont
think
all
night
long
and
certainly
not
at
5
00
a
bottle
but
for
someone
who
loves
ginger
this
was
a
really
nice
brew
poured
a
nice
cloudy
golden
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
as
for
the
smell
yep
its
made
with
ginger
its
noticeable
in
the
taste
as
well
a
little
too
noticeable
for
me
its
intense
then
i
realize
the
beer
is
cloudy
with
pieces
of
ginger
lots
of
em
i
tried
hard
but
just
couldnt
finish
this
one
and
had
to
send
it
seaward
this
one
is
for
the
true
ginger
lover
not
necessarily
the
true
beer
lover
d
very
drinkable
indeed
hard
to
compare
with
other
beers
of
its
type
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
could
certainly
have
more
but
couldnt
see
myself
enjoying
this
all
night
never
was
expecting
a
trip
tp
mexico
complete
margaritas
spiked
with
excess
salt
the
head
was
so
soft
floating
like
soap
atop
the
ocean
hit
tangy
at
first
definite
salt
rasberry
tart
ride
an
earthy
base
supporting
gueze
reminds
of
the
exotic
live
culture
potential
with
a
hint
of
lime
spritzer
ive
had
another
beer
from
them
and
i
dont
doubt
that
they
are
a
decent
brewery
but
wow
that
was
toooo
much
i
really
tried
to
be
openminded
with
this
one
oh
well
at
least
now
i
know
this
is
not
my
kind
of
beer
a
fine
little
ginger
beer
from
hitachino
nest
quite
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
when
you
have
the
chance
d
i
enjoyed
the
beer
itself
would
probably
get
it
again
hitachino
ginger
brew
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
mediumdense
head
the
head
quickly
dissipated
with
no
lacing
although
i
suspect
there
may
have
been
some
soap
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
initial
note
of
ginger
predominates
and
lasts
throughout
the
drinking
tastes
initially
of
ginger
with
a
malt
undertone
and
finishes
with
a
nice
gingermalt
combination
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
to
medium
overall
a
refreshing
summer
beer
with
a
very
good
drinkability
my
only
qualm
was
a
weird
aftertaste
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
i
suspect
that
there
was
some
soap
residue
which
also
may
have
caused
the
head
to
disappear
so
fast
d
a
rich
and
spicy
beer
a
bit
thick
for
my
taste
but
fairly
drinkable
the
ginger
character
is
weaker
than
i
expected
but
the
malt
is
quite
nice
and
what
ginger
is
present
plays
off
of
the
malt
in
a
nice
way
hitachino
nest
real
ginger
brew
pours
a
georgious
dark
orangish
amber
with
a
nice
stiff
medium
lasting
head
the
smell
is
moderate
and
pleasantly
spiced
with
ginger
ginger
is
also
the
backbone
of
the
taste
coming
out
very
nicely
with
a
slight
tartness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
great
it
sports
a
smooth
moderately
dense
feel
with
a
medium
to
low
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
ginger
beer
this
is
right
on
it
really
has
everything
that
i
could
possibly
want
from
a
specialty
brew
of
this
kind
overall
this
is
really
pleasant
and
enjoyable
a
good
benchmark
for
what
a
ginger
brew
should
try
to
be
i
remember
thinking
these
beers
were
pretty
expensive
and
on
my
first
trip
to
bottleworks
since
joining
ba
the
guy
working
at
the
time
asked
me
if
hitachino
nest
beers
were
also
expensive
in
japan
i
said
yes
they
were
but
actually
they
are
really
not
bad
compared
to
some
other
jcraftbeers
definitely
recommended
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
decent
retention
and
no
real
lace
aroma
is
nice
sweet
yet
spicey
ginger
a
little
hoppiness
and
a
sweet
maltiness
taste
is
nice
a
malty
backbone
with
a
sweet
ginger
touch
kind
of
weaker
than
i
was
hoping
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
moderate
low
alcohol
and
decent
flavors
make
the
beer
drinkable
but
in
small
doses
overall
not
bad
i
am
really
not
a
fan
of
the
ginger
beers
but
even
i
have
to
admit
that
this
one
was
not
bad
at
all
i
think
i
might
even
try
it
again
one
day
and
would
sure
to
take
a
test
of
it
on
tap
if
given
the
chance
if
you
see
it
and
its
reasonable
its
not
a
bad
bet
drinkability
better
than
expected
seriously
plenty
of
ginger
without
being
offputting
pours
a
very
nice
brown
orange
reddish
color
with
a
small
thin
head
almost
no
lacing
below
average
carbonation
with
a
fairly
strong
smell
of
flowery
hops
followed
by
spice
tastes
or
ginger
and
light
malts
with
hops
as
a
backbone
light
body
flavor
is
medium
with
the
ginger
not
over
powering
pours
dark
amber
with
a
lasting
offwhite
head
atop
pretty
nice
looking
beer
nose
is
malty
with
some
spicy
ginger
notes
and
hoplike
aromas
wafting
up
somewhat
full
bodied
and
malty
with
tartness
and
some
light
ginger
spiciness
with
a
semirich
body
and
a
light
ginger
flavor
in
the
finish
as
well
not
bad
and
you
actually
get
some
of
the
advertised
ginger
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
copper
body
with
some
slow
moving
bubbles
and
a
thinnish
head
that
manages
to
maintain
itself
smells
of
some
soft
bready
and
caramel
malts
with
a
fresh
ginger
crispness
that
is
rather
strong
yet
melds
well
with
everything
flavor
starts
off
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
maltiness
that
i
would
best
describe
as
a
mix
between
breadiness
and
crackeriness
the
bright
ginger
introduces
itself
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
lovely
lingering
ginger
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
creamiest
ive
come
across
in
a
long
while
moderate
in
weight
really
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
this
went
amazingly
well
with
a
cracked
black
pepper
encrusted
goat
cheese
drinkablity
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
very
interesting
and
unique
taste
is
of
ginger
nice
flavor
sort
of
expands
on
the
palate
with
sweet
hints
of
brown
sugar
not
overwhelming
also
faint
hops
a
really
nice
beer
i
like
the
occasional
ginger
brew
and
this
one
is
well
worth
looking
for
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
another
from
uwajimaya
in
seattle
and
my
first
japanese
beer
appearance
is
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
dissapating
head
that
leaves
a
thin
film
ginger
dominates
the
aroma
with
a
sweetness
along
with
other
herbs
and
spice
im
going
to
have
to
say
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
slight
burned
sugar
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
good
solid
viscous
medium
with
good
carbonation
for
this
type
of
beer
an
interesting
beer
with
some
charactoristics
i
did
enjoy
very
cool
beer
im
a
fan
of
hazy
murky
muddy
looking
beers
this
one
was
all
that
nice
and
muddy
like
swamp
water
reddish
brown
with
dark
pumpkin
colored
feet
almost
seemed
to
glow
maybe
it
was
like
magic
radioactive
voodoo
swamp
water
big
thick
light
tan
head
that
held
really
well
only
reason
i
dont
give
it
a
5
is
because
there
was
barely
any
lace
left
behind
nose
was
great
but
not
as
powerful
as
i
was
hoping
for
sweet
caramel
malt
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
sweet
spicy
caramel
malt
as
a
matter
of
fact
ginger
was
the
highlight
but
the
hops
and
yeast
also
added
another
faint
dimension
to
me
it
tasted
wonderful
ginger
came
out
more
and
more
as
it
warmed
taste
was
almost
like
liquid
candied
ginger
for
adults
well
balanced
with
a
long
lasting
gingery
finish
in
the
bottom
of
my
throat
a
pleasant
warming
caused
by
the
ginger
was
a
cool
change
of
pace
from
a
hop
or
alcohol
type
burn
the
sweet
malt
really
was
the
perfect
vehicle
to
ride
that
ginger
down
as
well
soft
silky
and
medium
full
bodied
easy
and
fun
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
complexities
but
not
something
id
want
all
day
everyday
best
ginger
ale
walcohol
ive
ever
had
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
re
color
the
head
is
massive
thick
and
creamy
it
recedes
slowly
into
nice
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
ginger
cream
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
had
tones
of
ginger
but
no
real
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
spiced
beer
i
would
much
rather
have
an
anchor
osa
thankfully
the
bartender
did
me
right
by
pouring
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
nutty
with
an
obvious
ginger
kick
the
taste
was
more
sutle
until
the
finish
which
was
all
ginger
it
was
interesting
to
drink
one
but
i
think
all
that
ginger
wouldnt
be
great
for
more
than
that
wow
they
werent
lying
about
the
ginger
this
tastes
almost
more
like
ginger
beer
than
a
beer
brewed
with
ginger
molassesbrown
sugar
flavors
prevail
throughout
as
well
though
the
ginger
is
in
complete
control
of
the
palate
this
is
not
an
everyday
drinker
here
its
fun
to
try
once
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
ever
again
as
with
all
the
other
hitachino
beers
i
have
sampled
this
was
an
utter
disappointment
picked
up
several
hitachino
nest
beers
on
a
recent
trip
to
nashville
pours
the
color
of
a
thick
and
dark
honey
some
slight
lacing
but
an
aggressive
pour
yields
no
head
not
picking
up
much
in
smell
either
but
this
is
definately
malt
over
hops
the
ginger
seems
to
stand
out
in
the
taste
more
when
this
beer
is
on
the
cooler
side
it
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
aftertaste
but
there
is
no
burn
from
the
ginger
quite
mild
i
enjoyed
this
less
as
the
beer
warmed
it
just
seemed
to
get
maltier
and
maltier
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
fine
alcohol
is
well
hidden
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
but
id
have
prefered
a
more
dominant
ginger
presence
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
brown
color
that
almost
turns
to
amber
when
held
up
in
the
light
there
is
virtually
no
head
when
poured
the
smell
is
mostly
malty
but
there
is
a
special
addition
of
ginger
that
forces
its
way
through
and
is
very
inviting
the
taste
is
great
it
tastes
a
lot
like
normal
ginger
beers
on
the
market
reeds
is
the
most
popular
but
the
slight
addition
of
malt
tones
down
the
ginger
and
couples
to
form
a
really
interesting
mixture
there
is
very
little
carbonation
so
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
a
generic
malt
beverage
the
lingering
taste
is
thick
and
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
pungent
ginger
kick
that
begs
for
anther
sip
a
very
special
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
dull
rust
color
with
a
thinner
white
headthe
ginger
is
light
in
the
nose
intermingling
with
some
floral
hop
and
toasted
grain
same
as
the
aromas
really
on
the
palate
the
ginger
comes
thru
late
and
gives
a
little
edge
at
about
mid
swallow
up
front
is
a
mix
of
floral
citric
hop
and
toasty
lightly
sweet
malt
hmm
not
half
bad
but
the
ginger
could
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
before
the
lingering
finishglad
i
tried
but
not
sure
i
would
go
back
di
have
had
other
hitachino
prodcuts
and
defnitely
was
underwhelmed
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
overrated
to
me
however
with
this
one
they
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
while
this
maybe
pricey
it
will
be
an
occasional
treat
in
my
fridge
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
if
it
were
available
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
likes
ginger
i
really
like
this
but
its
a
subjective
thing
with
a
lot
of
spice
ales
i
can
see
how
people
would
think
this
is
spicy
and
nasty
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
one
i
enjoyed
and
glad
i
tried
but
not
one
i
would
search
for
d
good
it
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
delivery
of
ginger
in
a
beer
ginger
is
the
sort
of
spice
that
has
a
fine
line
between
unnoticable
and
overkill
this
does
pretty
well
at
walking
that
line
over
all
an
interesting
beer
its
spicy
enough
for
me
to
first
think
its
a
winter
warmer
but
its
gentle
and
subtle
enough
to
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
night
i
find
hitachino
to
be
very
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
id
buy
it
again
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
again
ad
reviewed
it
but
dont
bother
scouring
the
globe
for
it
appearance
was
a
caramel
color
like
a
dark
ipa
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
gingery
with
some
other
unidentifiable
other
spice
character
anise
flavor
was
very
strong
ginger
and
this
made
the
mouthfeel
quite
crisp
and
pretty
good
but
the
ginger
notes
also
made
this
beer
not
all
that
drinkablesessionable
d
this
beer
has
to
much
ginger
and
not
enough
supporting
flavors
i
like
ginger
but
i
just
couldnt
find
the
beer
in
this
glass
drinkability
very
expensive
for
a
bottle
around
4
but
if
youre
curious
be
curious
i
think
they
were
when
they
brewed
it
and
honestly
for
the
singular
experience
this
crazy
and
enigmatic
ginger
brew
brings
i
say
at
least
grab
a
bottle
and
see
what
you
think
pours
into
a
pilsener
glass
at
muramoto
in
madison
wi
a
blushing
chestnut
with
a
creamy
khaki
head
the
ginger
is
not
overdone
what
a
pleasant
surprise
it
just
lingers
throughout
while
still
allowing
for
wonderful
fruit
notes
mainly
strawberries
to
shine
flavor
matches
with
a
healthy
amount
of
caramel
body
is
light
and
palatable
complimented
our
deserts
of
strawberry
eggrolls
ginger
sorbet
and
black
sesame
cream
brule
perfectly
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
it
really
goes
against
me
drinkability
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
could
grow
on
me
an
expensive
session
beer
though
at
3
79
per
12ounces
hitachino
nest
real
ginger
ale
along
with
celebration
ale
and
white
ale
is
the
cream
of
the
kiuchi
crop
one
probably
has
to
like
ginger
to
like
it
so
it
wont
appeal
to
everyone
it
sure
as
hell
appeals
to
me
though
i
just
wish
i
could
remember
where
i
bought
the
bottle
since
id
love
to
lay
my
hands
on
a
few
more
its
an
interesting
unique
brew
ginger
dominates
but
does
not
overpower
other
flavors
as
tasty
as
it
is
one
is
enough
as
the
drink
progresses
more
alcoholic
sharpness
becomes
noticeable
a
good
one
to
try
because
its
something
different
but
not
anything
to
have
with
any
regularity
it
has
a
rawness
about
it
might
be
good
to
have
with
a
spicy
asian
cuisine
that
has
ginger
as
a
main
ingredient
on
its
own
a
bit
much
probably
wont
appeal
too
much
to
ginger
freaks
but
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
good
application
of
ginger
in
a
beer
japan
stand
up
and
be
proud
kono
biru
wa
totemo
sugoi
desu
one
of
my
new
favorites
head
pours
thick
and
with
a
slightly
reddish
tint
no
single
taste
or
aroma
is
overwhelming
but
the
ginger
shines
through
and
wakes
up
the
whole
palate
a
bunch
of
yeast
was
present
in
the
bottle
leaving
a
haze
in
my
second
glass
pour
carefully
pours
coppery
orange
with
a
fat
offwhite
head
that
faded
very
fast
the
has
lots
of
ginger
some
sweet
malts
and
a
very
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
has
some
nice
citrusy
ginger
almost
like
orange
peel
some
malt
and
ale
yeast
flavors
and
a
tiny
twang
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
rich
but
the
carbonation
and
ginger
flavors
make
me
perceive
it
as
lighter
and
more
refreshing
actually
i
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
this
is
probably
my
favorite
japanese
beer
and
my
favorite
herbal
brew
as
well
the
tan
head
on
the
copper
colored
beer
fell
quickly
but
a
citrusy
nose
with
a
lot
of
spice
promised
a
lot
and
a
lot
is
what
it
is
first
a
lot
of
ginger
with
an
overwhelming
initial
taste
followed
by
a
bitter
bitter
finish
it
improves
after
a
few
sips
and
the
taste
buds
acclimate
surrender
to
the
ginger
also
a
lot
of
alcohol
7
taste
comes
through
as
well
blended
with
a
soda
like
high
carbonation
bite
as
well
it
did
clear
my
sinuses
for
a
bit
with
that
said
it
has
some
balance
and
if
you
like
ginger
which
i
suspect
is
my
main
problem
with
this
beer
i
can
see
where
there
are
some
really
ravenous
ginger
fans
who
are
terribly
loyal
to
this
brew
from
japan
enjoy
with
caution
drinkability
certainly
not
kiuchis
finest
effort
but
worth
a
try
nonetheless
i
want
the
ginger
flavor
to
be
kicked
up
a
little
more
because
as
it
is
this
is
just
kind
of
a
blasé
pale
ale
nice
on
the
nose
not
quite
as
nice
on
the
palate
good
mouthfeel
not
as
carbonated
as
granville
islands
ginger
beer
and
thus
not
as
sodaish
great
summer
drink
one
that
excels
served
ice
cold
overall
i
was
worried
that
the
ginger
in
this
beer
would
be
overpowering
like
a
ginger
altoid
but
they
did
a
really
good
job
of
allowing
the
ginger
to
be
the
focus
of
the
beer
without
letting
it
overpower
the
other
flavors
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
is
explosively
carbonated
the
ginger
taste
is
dominate
and
lingering
as
a
ginger
sting
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
consume
pours
a
hazy
bright
bronze
in
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
of
moderate
duration
and
enough
lace
to
pique
my
interest

this
looks
sturdy
nose
offers
a
hint
of
pineapple
and
spice
with
the
ginger
being
surprisingly
subtle

of
liquid

without
the

also
catching
a
bready

strongold

ginger

and
just
a
touch
of
bittering
hops
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
ginger
and

work
in
a
pointcounterpoint
manner
delivering
a
spicy
kick
within
a
mediumfull
bodied
strong
ale
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
more
as
a
compliment
to
the
sharp
tangy
ginger
and
there
is
a
touch
of
resiny
pine
in
the
aromatics
the
malt
profile
is
obscured
by
the
spice
and
warming
alcohol
but
adds
just
enough
sweetness
to
this
dry
spicy
strongyetvery
drinkable
brew
a
very
good
tipple
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
beer
has
a
small
fizzy
head
that
evaporates
quickly
there
is
a
definte
belgian
like
floral
and
herbal
character
to
the
aroma
similar
to
beers
that
i
have
had
from
offshore
ales
and
the
tap
when
mr
paquette
was
there
that
whole
floral
and
herbal
texture
carrys
over
into
the
taste
with
hints
of
malty
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
floral
hop
finish
quite
a
suprising
brew
quite
plesant
in
its
herbal
spicy
and
intriguing
character
expeimental
brews
rarely
contain
the
finess
and
roundness
as
this
one
aromas
are
floral
and
flowery
with
ginger
honey
suckle
and
flowers
basically
a
potpouri
to
the
nose
tastes
less
bitter
and
biteey
than
expected
starts
with
what
would
be
a
fine
pale
ale
throw
in
a
ton
of
ginger
but
without
the
heartburn
qualities
that
are
associated
with
bold
spices
melded
to
the
tone
that
is
expected
from
corriander
lightly
peppery
and
lemony
to
top
it
off
finishes
with
a
prickly
and
numbing
carbonation
and
a
dry
powdery
texture
leaves
a
light
ginger
alcohol
and
honey
flavor
to
reflect
upon
yum
i
like
if
you
hate
ginger
you
wont
but
then
who
can
resist
the
smiling
ginger
root
mascot
on
the
label
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
rather
dry
with
well
placed
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
but
the
finish
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
after
each
sip
not
a
brew
id
drink
regularly
however
its
quite
intriguing
and
definetly
brings
the
ginger
flavor
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
kiuchis
brews
or
if
you
like
ginger
pours
a
murky
copper
with
a
few
fine
trails
of
carbonation
rising
through
the
middle
a
small
oatmeal
colored
head
forms
but
doesnt
hold
out
very
long
smells
like
a
malty
pale
ale
but
with
a
dash
of
ginger
actually
it
reminds
me
of
spiced
pumpkin
smell
for
some
reason
solid
caramel
maltyness
holds
up
against
the
modest
ginger
the
finish
is
only
slightly
bitter
and
theres
a
mild
bite
to
the
ginger
the
hops
are
hard
to
pick
out
but
i
think
theres
some
piney
hops
in
the
mix
almost
chewy
body
does
well
to
carry
the
sweet
flavors
and
keep
the
ginger
in
check
wow
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
im
impressed
not
as
hot
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
that
is
good
well
balanced
flavorful
and
im
a
ginger
fan
so
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
will
buy
it
again
but
only
occasionally
due
to
the
cost
of
3
50
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
tried
this
rarity
on
tap
at
the
lazy
boy
in
white
plains
ny
i
sampled
it
before
i
went
for
a
pint
it
tasted
pretty
good
sort
of
interesting
after
a
few
sips
i
knew
i
had
made
a
mistake
this
is
heavy
very
flavorful
brew
usually
not
a
bad
thing
but
here
were
talking
lots
of
ginger
lots
of
mint
clove
spruce
pine
etc
this
stuf
was
just
plain
nasty
imho
to
much
personality
here
equals
tough
to
drink
over
the
top
in
the
herbedspiced
department
for
my
palate
a
heavy
pour
and
got
a
onefingered
head
that
vanished
leaving
no
lace
hazy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
faint
ginger
nose
starts
with
sweet
ginger
flavor
but
very
mild

hops
are
there
but
not
overpowering
3
89
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
finishes
rather
clean
for
such
an
experimental
beer
but
the
drinkability
suffers
a
good
accompinament
for
food
good
sipper
but
not
the
strongest
thing

still
tasty
for
how
strong
it
is
root
beer
flavor
excessively
sweet
mild
flavor
smooth
subtle
hints
of
spice
this
will
be
my
go
to
this
holiday
season
a
wellmade
wellbalanced
for
the
style
holiday
lager
the
spices
do
grow
as
the
beer
warms
alcohol
is
very
wellintegrated
adding
a
bit
of
winter
warmth
rather
than
heat
nicely
done
not
a
beer
that
really
stands
up
to
2
years
but
its
not
that
bad
worth
0
99
for
sure
not
worth
9
99
for
a
4
pack
inseason
maybe
ill
grab
another
to
age
for
a
year
but
eh
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
concoction
of
spices
its
easy
to
drink
considering
its
big
body
make
sure
you
have
something
to
eat
before
you
try
drinking
this
it
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
arent
careful
i
love
the
flavors
and
the
smell
they
say
holidays
to
me
had
i
not
read
the
label
i
would
have
thought
it
to
be
a
dark
winter
ale
hands
down
this
is
the
most
well
spiced
holiday
beer
i
have
had
yet
next
year
at
christmas
time
i
will
be
eagerly
looking
out
for
this
beer
it
is
one
thing
to
have
nice
spicing
it
is
another
thing
entirely
to
have
that
and
a
solid
malt
base
to
build
off
of
which
lakefront
definitely
does
with
this
beer
o
overall
a
bit
unbearing
sweet
and
overspiced
and
one
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
a
hot
mesh
of
spicy
sweetness
unbalanced
a
hard
one
to
consume
and
not
one
that
i
will
miss
next
holiday
season
3
85
o
definitely
worth
a
try
smells
good
tasty
but
i
think
it
wuld
be
better
balanced
if
the
alcohol
were
a
point
or
two
lower
overall
not
that
complex
the
high
abv
helped
keep
this
beer
from
a
lower
score
holiday
spice
lager
is
only
the
second
herbspiced
beer
i
have
had
to
date
holiday
spice
is
by
far
my
favorite
in
the
style
this
lager
goes
well
paired
with
bbq
potato
chips
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smell
is
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
sweet
notes
very
powerful
mostly
inviting
taste
starts
with
the
clove
and
cinnamon
and
moves
to
the
nutmeg
and
stays
sweet
throughout
a
hint
of
orange
comes
in
at
the
aftertaste
then
the
cinnamon
and
clove
linger
the
high
abv
comes
through
at
the
end
of
each
sip
easy
to
tell
that
it
is
much
higher
a
medium
mouthfeel
not
super
smooth
but
nice
the
noticeable
abv
takes
away
from
the
beer
overall
a
nice
holiday
beer
super
spiced
tons
of
flavor
not
for
those
looking
for
subtle
worth
a
taste
overall
an
interesting
beer
definitely
one
to
limit
to
once
a
year
it
is
a
lot
like
a
pumpkin
beer
without
the
pumpkin
read
cinnamon
and
nutmegy
and
has
some
flaws
but
overall
it
is
drinkable
and
perhaps
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
it
pours
a
dark
clear
redbrown
with
a
tan
head
with
poor
retention
lacing
is
moderate
while
the
head
lasts
it
reeks
of
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
malt
however
shines
through
that
dense
jungle
of
spice
brilliantly
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
all
of
those
wonderful
holiday
spices
there
is
also
a
moderately
bitter
hop
presence
the
finish
is
very
breadlike
almost
to
the
point
that
you
can
chew
on
it
there
is
moderate
carbonation
with
a
moderately
full
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
its
quite
pleasant
o
i
cant
believe
how
well
they
hide
the
11
abv
and
i
also
cant
believe
ive
waited
till
now
to
try
this
one
this
beer
rivals
other
holiday
brews
ive
tried
recently
i
think
ill
be
picking
up
a
6
pack
soon
a
spicy
robust
beer
with
a
heavy
smell
of
nutmeg
couldnt
really
get
the
orange
peel
but
dont
know
that
i
cared
to
poured
with
a
less
than
1
head
not
too
heavy
definitely
would
recommend
this
for
a
second
round
abv
was
very
masked
behind
the
rich
robust
mouthfeel
of
spices
had
this
at
a
work
christmas
party
now
im
on
my
second
six
pack
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
holiday
beers
spiced
beers
but
i
tried
after
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
for
me
this
spiced
beer
hits
it
right
on
the
head
its
not
over
the
top
but
is
very
spice
forward
i
feel
like
all
of
the
spice
have
their
place
on
stage
with
this
one
its
a
little
sweet
but
just
what
im
looking
for
after
trying
all
the
messes
of
christmas
past
and
at
11
this
beer
is
crazy
drinkable
i
almost
think
it
has
to
be
a
typo
haha
o
lb
manages
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
holiday
lager
without
going
over
the
top
on
spicing
should
age
well
i
need
to
try
to
get
a
few
more
for
my
cellar
o
nothing
ushers
in
winter
and
the
christmas
spirit
better
than
some
kenny
g
holiday
classics
and
a
snifter
of
lakefronts
soothing
holiday
spice
the
beers
spicy
aroma
and
full
rich
flavor
work
well
with
its
high
alcohol
and
warming
feel
but
i
seem
to
enjoy
this
especially
when
compared
sidebyside
with
a
year
on
it
luckily
lakefront
released
a
plethora
of
vintage
2011
where
the
alcohol
is
more
subtle
and
the
spice
believe
it
or
not
seems
to
shine
with
a
little
more
cheer
whether
you
enjoy
it
fresh
or
aged
this
beer
is
certainly
a
holiday
staple
worthy
of
any
celebratory
occasion
o
the
best
seasonal
lf
has
to
offer
i
usually
get
a
six
pack
of
this
each
holiday
a
nice
spiced
beer
to
mix
it
up
once
in
while
update
had
no
idea
this
beer
was
that
strong
until
i
looked
at
the
above
criteria
wow
it
really
hides
the
alcohol
well
would
have
expected
an
11
beer
to
be
much
less
sessionable
overall
nice
surprise
big
beer
nice
and
balanced
great
holiday
treat
overall
i
tried
their
other
beers
and
it
seems
this
has
the
most
balance
and
taste
i
ever
tried
from
them
worth
picking
up
a
single
which
was
hella
cheap
at
around
2
bucks
overall
being
really
close
i
tend
to
want
lakefront
to
be
more
than
they
are
but
this
is
another
in
a
lineup
full
of
decent
beers
not
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
again
but
i
definitely
would
try
to
talk
someone
out
of
getting
it
i
did
just
have
an
ohmygosh
moment
when
i
looked
up
here
and
see
the
abv
at
11
i
was
thinking
it
was
a
6
11
is
hard
to
believe
that
is
completely
hidden
so
there
is
the
redeeming
qualtiy
of
this
beer
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
of
this
strength
and
a
complete
fooler
o
a
brownsugary
sweet
fruity
and
mildly
spicy
strong
lager
clean
yet
complex
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
the
christmas
season
overall
a
beautifully
spiced
lager
that
smells
out
of
this
world
and
tastes
very
nice
the
very
well
hidden
abv
doesnt
hurt
either
o
good
winter
warmer
but
even
better
considering
the
abv
will
have
to
look
for
this
next
winter
most
winter
wamers
that
ive
had
went
down
slowly
since
they
felt
so
strong
and
spicy
this
was
not
easy
to
quaff
since
this
had
a
heavy
feel
to
it
still
it
was
a
good
beer
and
fans
of
the
style
wont
be
disappointed
here
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
next
year
with
a
nice
plate
of
oatmeal
cookies
this
isnt
a
musttry
but
i
dont
think
anyone
would
be
let
down
by
this
either
very
drinkable
for
11
i
enjoyed
the
spicing
on
this
one
it
didnt
overpower
the
base
beer
but
was
prominent
enough
to
be
easily
noticed
4
5
d
im
going
to
have
to
look
for
this
next
year
i
only
wish
i
drank
this
a
few
weeks
ago
when
i
first
bought
it
so
i
could
buy
some
more
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
theres
some
good
stuff
in
there
but
something
that
really
shines
on
the
nose
perhaps
its
a
lot
harder
to
make
a
winter
warmer
out
of
lager
nevertheless
this
is
a
solid
effort
and
worth
a
single
pickup
wow
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
good
pick
the
brownish
red
color
suggests
a
heavier
brew
and
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
cinnamon
and
plumb
encourage
it
even
more
when
i
took
my
first
sip
my
tongue
was
bombarded
with
flavor
of
plumb
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
wine
barrel
aging
this
made
for
a
great
combination
that
i
found
most
appealing
its
tasty
and
thick
and
smooth
perfect
for
a
night
by
the
fireplace
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
12
inch
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
streaks
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
lots
of
spice
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
caramel
honey
and
a
spice
overload
there
is
no
real
bitterness
per
se
but
the
spices
do
linger
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
which
feels
weird
with
the
spices
in
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
none
of
the
spice
smells
and
flavors
really
stand
out
which
creates
a
muddled
spice
quality
this
is
my
favorite
winter
warmer
i
like
most
of
the
ones
ive
tried
but
this
one
i
keep
on
coming
back
to
i
do
have
to
second
that
note
on
the
side
of
the
page
that
says
it
isnt
recommended
for
cellaring
i
attempted
to
cellar
a
6
from
last
years
batch
and
it
just
ended
up
tasting
like
bad
bananas
with
some
spice
so
dont
ruin
the
beer
drink
it
while
its
fresh
o
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
ive
had
this
year
o
this
beer
bring
much
merriment
probably
my
favorite
holiday
beer
which
i
tend
not
to
like
i
would
say
its
a
doppelbock
lager
thats
got
the
perfect
amount
of
spices
not
too
much
but
you
can
notice
them
maybe
not
the
best
beer
for
the
new
craft
drinker
due
to
the
heavier
body
and
powerful
flavor
but
aficionados
will
appreciate
it
get
a
six
pack
for
a
loved
one
or
a
case
for
yourself
either
way
this
lager
is
a
holiday
must
overall
its
my
favorite
winter
warmer
so
far
this
is
closer
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
others
the
lager
part
of
it
comes
through
as
its
very
like
a
dopplebock
thats
been
dressed
up
for
the
holidays
i
think
i
need
a
6
pack
of
this
around
really
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
winter
beers
out
there
that
is
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
the
flavor
profile
is
big
with
fruits
and
spices
figuring
prominently
the
finish
is
dry
and
boozy
one
to
sip
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
that
doesnt
leave
much
in
way
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavily
spiced
to
the
point
where
it
almost
doesnt
really
have
aberration
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
strong
found
that
this
beer
goes
well
with
food
because
the
spices
are
really
powerful
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
and
very
warming
not
a
terrible
brew
id
drink
it
again
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
minimal
tan
head
aroma
of
orange
peel
some
cinnamon
and
sweet
spices
some
fruitiness
caramel
malt
taste
is
bitter
orange
peel
some
sweet
spices
dark
toasted
malts
moderate
carbonation
and
full
body
finish
is
sweet
dark
malt
with
bitter
orange
peel
and
sweet
spices
the
alcohol
esters
really
come
thru
in
the
end
overall
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
the
11
abv
is
completely
masked
and
is
nearly
undetectable
the
thick
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
definite
sipper
but
the
excellent
flavors
and
smells
keep
me
wanting
more
this
will
definitely
be
in
my
glass
next
christmas
morning
my
aggro
pour
revealed
a
very
active
beer
that
was
capable
of
creating
an
abundance
of
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
in
fact
there
was
initially
so
much
head
that
the
beer
seemed
to
be
cascading
as
it
settled
a
good
whiff
of
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
that
at
least
clove
cinnamon
and
allspice
went
into
its
production
there
was
an
orangecitrus
scent
also
but
the
honey
was
lost
in
the
mix
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
cola
highlights
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
lot
of
spice
evident
in
the
mouth
i
stand
by
my
claim
of
cinnamon
and
clove
since
they
were
the
most
powerful
flavors
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
spicy
and
pleasant
my
headache
began
to
subside
and
i
was
ready
for
another
beer
not
necessarily
another
of
this
one
but
another
beer
all
the
same
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
spicy
nutmeg
and
ginger
standing
out
taste
is
also
full
of
spice
some
oranges
lots
of
flavors
blending
well
together
here
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
great
beer
for
the
holidays
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
caramel
brown
that
was
very
slightly
opaque
thin
caramel
white
head
that
clung
nicely
aroma
was
banana
bread
with
some
cloves
with
some
nice
spiciness
taste
was
very
nuanced
tastes
started
as
a
milky
lactose
then
shifted
to
a
banana
bread
and
then
finished
up
with
a
peppery
spice
outstanding
mouth
feel
coated
very
well
but
wasnt
too
thick
slightly
bubbly
in
the
mouth
great
for
a
winter
warmer
very
drinkable
a
solid
sipper
that
kept
me
wanting
more
db
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
i
have
come
across
the
alcohol
builds
with
warmth
and
makes
this
a
one
bottle
experience
this
was
a
gift
form
upper
midwest
relatives
when
here
at
christmastime
oh
my
gawd
didnt
know
this
was
11
until
i
opened
this
review
page
might
be
a
record
for
me
on
second
check
its
2
on
my
personal
abv
well
then
lets
give
it
a
whirl
serving
slightly
chilled
not
cold
as
this
should
bring
out
what
this
selection
has
to
offer
popping
the
top
i
get
a
big
waft
of
cloves
allspice
and
cinnamon
not
unlike
a
pumpkin
pie
pours
into
a
tulip
glass
a
deep
root
beer
color
with
a
medium
bubble
head
that
wisps
away
on
the
taste
this
brew
start
with
a
big
syrupthick
mouthfeel
very
high
viscosity
the
taste
has
an
upfront
spicyness
just
like
the
smell
the
middle
taste
has
some
roasted
malts
then
the
finish
has
a
dry
chocolate
slight
bitterness
all
this
while
maintaining
spice
flavors
through
the
whole
taste
this
is
one
holiday
brew
to
sit
next
to
the
fireplace
or
as
a
desert
beer
i
dont
know
how
this
brew
could
be
beat
outstanding
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
as
the
high
alcohol
is
getting
to
me
already
i
compare
this
to
anchors
christmas
ale
which
in
my
opinion
has
a
better
appearance
a
richer
more
unique
aroma
and
taste
as
well
as
a
silkier
mouthfeel
but
thats
it
i
like
this
one
better
than
all
the
rest
of
the
winter
warmers
i
have
had
this
year
next
to
anchors
d
this
is
a
nice
brew
to
try
in
the
winter
months
one
that
i
would
get
a
six
pack
of
and
save
some
for
years
to
come
a
nice
warmer
for
sure
this
is
definitely
a
unique
one
a
nice
beer
to
look
forward
to
come
winter
if
youre
into
holiday
beers
w
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
honey
etc
definitely
check
this
one
out
you
can
definitely
age
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
caramel
brown
color
with
a
cap
of
foam
that
dwindles
to
a
wisp
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
nutmeg
and
clove
and
orange
this
a
very
flavorful
brew
malty
but
mostly
fruity
and
sweet
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
the
fruity
sweetness
plows
through
the
center
and
finishes
with
sweetness
and
a
dash
of
spice
the
chest
fills
with
warmness
after
a
few
sips
a
big
beer
for
the
holiday
season
the
large
abv
makes
me
wish
i
would
have
saved
it
for
when
the
inlaws
come
over
overall
a
lot
going
on
here
big
and
bold
and
a
pleasant
experience
though
probably
not
in
my
top
3
holiday
brews
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
slightly
above
in
all
aspects
but
should
be
expected
because
of
the
abv
regardless
there
is
a
lot
of
spicing
but
as
a
fan
of
a
well
done
holiday
ale
i
enjoy
adequate
spicing
and
flavor
so
i
still
enjoyed
this
no
way
you
can
tell
it
is
11
abv
i
sure
didnt
time
to
go
to
bed
this
is
the
quintessential
holiday
lager
no
doubt
about
it
i
thought
it
would
be
overpowering
but
it
was
smooth
and
delightful
lakefront
brewery
makes
consistently
good
seasonal
brews
the
holiday
spice
lager
is
no
exception
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
nice
aroma
and
taste
of
oranges
honey
vanilla
nutmeg
spices
and
yeast
this
beer
taste
like
christmas
and
will
certainly
get
better
with
age
no
way
i
would
drink
another
one
of
these
i
can
barely
finish
one
the
sweetness
is
overwhelming
i
could
never
drink
this
to
complement
any
food
it
reminds
me
of
overly
sweet
cheap
whiskey
its
not
enjoyable
to
drink
i
found
it
hard
to
get
down
i
dont
often
give
bad
reviews
but
this
beer
is
nearly
undrinkable
seems
a
bit
early
for
something
like
this
but
i
dont
care
enough
to
argue
it
pours
a
murky
burnt
auburn
topped
by
a
mere
few
layers
of
small
glowing
offwhite
bubbles
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
nutmeg
mandarin
oranges
some
pinches
of
brown
sugar
and
an
underlying
aquifer
of
bland
liquid
pumpernickel
honestly
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
my
strils
the
taste
reminds
me
of
gingerbread
drizzled
with
a
tropical
fruit
cocktail
the
kind
dole
likes
to
overcharge
for
you
know
what
im
talkin
about
a
hint
of
what
seems
like
spearmint
comes
forth
in
the
finish
but
luckily
this
is
a
minor
occurrence
unfortunately
following
this
is
a
blast
of
sickly
sweet
nothingness
those
were
the
words
my
brain
formulated
on
the
spot
and
those
are
the
words
im
gonna
stick
with
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
back
end
of
the
finish
is
rather
cloying
the
body
is
a
lumbering
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
wet
feel
overall
what
was
probably
a
delicioussounding
recipe
comes
out
a
bit
below
par
i
hope
this
is
just
last
years
vintage
if
it
is
ill
make
a
second
visit
and
see
if
things
are
any
better
fresh
d
drinkability
is
fairly
high
considering
the
abv
but
the
tasted
kind
of
knocks
it
down
for
me
personally
like
i
said
before
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
after
buying
cases
for
cheap
they
were
passed
around
to
friends
while
a
couple
loved
it
including
myself
the
others
dispised
it
after
a
couple
of
sips
for
beer
lovers
especially
winters
and
other
darks
definitely
an
interesting
brew
to
try
d
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
much
more
fitting
for
the
holiday
season
for
sure
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
great
desert
brew
or
nightcap
for
a
cold
winter
evening
spent
in
pajamas
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
but
thats
okay
this
one
will
last
me
a
while
as
i
swirl
sniff
and
slowly
sip
ive
been
less
than
impressed
with
lakefront
in
the
past
but
this
is
a
really
well
built
brew
d
rough
on
the
after
taste
with
the
ginger
and
higher
than
average
alcohol
content
not
really
light
on
the
stomach
the
website
states
that
this
beer
weighs
in
at
11
abv
its
hard
to
believe
that
one
all
i
get
fron
the
nose
is
holiday
spices
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
dark
fruits
mind
numbing
spices
including
cinnamon
ginger
allspice
etc
hints
of
vanilla
and
clove
dance
around
as
well
there
was
a
thread
about
some
guy
talking
about
how
he
was
able
to
finish
a
whole
six
pack
of
this
beer
and
he
called
it
the
holiday
spice
six
pack
challenge
now
thats
what
i
call
the
biggest
loser
cloyingly
sweet
honey
tones
coats
the
palate
with
this
shite
what
a
mess
of
a
beer
dark
syrup
with
spice
infused
layers
some
orange
peeel
and
honey
with
holiday
spices
i
cant
finish
this
is
pure
shit
mouthfeel
is
like
lighter
fluid
with
spice
and
booze
burn
as
it
warms
drinkability
sucks
and
i
cant
make
it
any
more
intricate
than
that
d

solid

not
noticeable
at
all
i
am
really
not
sure
where
the
lager
comes
into
play
i
really
dont
detect
anything
like
any
style
i
ever
had
for
good
reason
my
first
winter
warmer
it
is
like
pumpkin
ale
most
notably
dfh
pumkin
ale
with
a
twist
of
christmas
be
a
great
one
to
show
to
macro
drinkers
just
for
them
to
see
how
complex
and
different
a
beer
can
be
d
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
rather
quickly
and
the
spices
get
to
be
a
tad
overwhelming
it
was
unique
for
drinkabiliy
nice
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
slow
sipping
but
more
than
one
could
be
enjoyed
in
a
session
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
that
packs
quite
a
wallop
however
its
quite
drinkable
for
a
nearly
10
abv
beer
drinkability
why
bless
my
soul
that
was
all
kinds
of
alright
and
one
id
recommend

something

this

a

beer
but
nothing
i
would

for
again
it

this
is
a

full

holiday
beer

plenty
of

underlig
jul
is
a
boldtasting
spicy
winter
warmer
that
is
likely
to
raise
at
least
one
of
your
eyebrows
upon
the
first
sip
while
its
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
want
to
drink
in
large
volumes
or
even
very
frequently
it
is
still
a
very
creative
fullflavoured
strong
ale
that
makes
for
an
excellent
dessert
beer
or
nightcapper
any
fan
of
spiced
beers
or
north
americanstyle
winter
warmers
should
consider
seeking
this
one
out
because
its
a
fine
example
allaround
overall
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
you
cant
have
two
in
a
row
before
it
becomes
overwhelming
imo
overall
an
interesting
spiced
beer
as
mentioned
above
its
reminiscent
of
a
really
toned
down
jaegermeister
and
as
someone
who
enjoys
that
i
rather
enjoyed
this
its
definitely
something
that
is
enhanced
by
cool
weather
or
a
desire
to
drink
something
like
it
but
its
certainly
good
cost
is
a
bit
prohibitive
but
definitely
worth
a
try
i
had
a
ginger
rosemary
beer
that
almost
ruined
the
idea
of
putting
ginger
in
beer
and
im
glad
to
see
in
this
a
pronounced
but
balanced
character
smooth
complex
spiciness
and
lots
of
interesting
nuances
and
complex
flavours
a
bit
more
hops
wouldnt
hurt
as
would
not
gushing
all
over
the
place
but
a
delicious
complex
beer
with
decent
balance
i
would
try
another
batch
of
in
the
hopes
this
was
a
oneoff
problem
otherwise
my
rating
would
easily
have
exceeded

whoa
lots

odd
tastes
going

here
kind
of
like
a
stout
mixed
with
a
christmas
brew
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
worth
trying
to
see
how
different
a
beer
can
taste
overall
definitely
spicy
a
good
holiday
beer
wellrounded
and
balanced
nicely
done
o
a
solid
tasty
spicy
treat
with
a
fairly
good
balance
of
hops
and
big
sticky
malt

seeking
out
but
maybe
wait
for
the

it
goes
well

i
love
the

appreciate
that
its
from

and
am
enjoying
it
on
a
cold

a

that
brings
a
load
of
spices

whose

that
isnt

by
that

surprisingly
drinkable

i
quite
enjoyed
this

well

and
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
great

winter
brew
with
interesting

a

would
be

just
what
this

but
certainly
a

one
very
nice

warm

my
immediate
reaction
was
that
id
like
some
gingerbread
with
this
like
you
would
with
mulled
wine
well
but
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
tingly
feel
there
is
a
bit
of
roasted
maltiness
as
well
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
definitely
a

it
hits

sweetness

i
dont

with

choices
and
coriander
for
me
the
spices
really
stand
out
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
ginger
is
the
strongest
taste
but
in
all
reality
this
body
is
fairly
light
i
might
say
that
its
inbetween
medium
and
light
ginger
really
does
a
good
job
of
drying
things

almost
gives
it

ginger
is
the
big
player
here
nutmeg
the
taste
is

of
the

cant

in

its
just
too

is
a

it

its

for
those
summer
long
weekends
on
the

i
cant
think
of
another
scenario
where
id
reach
for
this
beer

not

theres

not

but
certainly
not

and
then
you
get
a

i
get

from
the

the

this

still
torn
the

itself
is
light

the
flavor
is
so

im

doing

at

overall
not
a
huge
fan

but
a
huge
fan
of

and
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
give
shorts
credit
for
something
unusual
and
creative
might
appeal
to
those
who
like

spicy
and
more
spicy
but
for
me
it
was
not
nicie
fantastic

and
bubbly
the
peppercorn
flavor
is

but
not

aftertaste
i
usually
dont
like
spiced
wheat
beers
and
i
really
dig
this
guy
highly
recommended
im
on
my
second
as
i
write
this
review
and
i
feel
number
three
on
the
way
as
always
shorts
is
trying
something
outofthebox
which
i
love
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
miss
the
mark
for
me
surprising
since
i
enjoy
the
peppercorn
additions
in
anniversary
ale
it
was
just
a
touch
overdone
in
this
brew
id
like
to
give
the
next
batch
a
go
and
perhaps
the
balance
will
be
there
little
to
no
head
on
a
hazy
golden
with
slight
orange
tinge
body
aroma
is
a
little
pungent
with
grains
honey
and
light
lemon
custard
flavor
is
a
little
spicy
with
quite
a
bit
of
honey
lemongrass
and
maybe
some
ginger
on
a
grainy
base
light
to
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
was
hoping
this
to
be
spicier
the
sweetness
isnt
very
well
balanced
and
it
feels
too
syrupy
well
we
have
a
nice
peppercorn
wheat
that
i
enjoyed
this
is
one
strange
yet
tasty
beer
by
shorts
i
should
also
note
this
is
the
first
shorts
ive
ever
had
it
essentially
tastes
like
a
tea
with
pepper
in
it
to
me
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
its
just
very
unusual
im
not
sure
id
drink
this
too
often
i
see
it
as
more
of
a
novelty
id
still
get
it
again
in
the
future
just
because
its
so
strangely
compelling
overall
the
peppercorn
lingers
on
the
tongue
along
with
the
lemon
zest
very
well
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
nose
had
me
very
worried
on
this
one
as
it
was
so
much
orange
zest
thankfully
it
did
settle
down
a
bit
unfortunately
it
settled
down
to
an
orange
tang
thing
the
flavor
is
a
wad
of
crap
and
spices
at
least
that
was
my
first
impression
then
it
seems
like
it
starts
to
work
then
it
seems
like
an
obnoxious
contrast
im
ready
to
move
on
here
m
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slight
chew
moderate
carbonation
o
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
it
was
definitely
very
different
then
anything
im
used
to
lots
of
interesting
flavors
that
makes
for
a
fairly
complex
beer
while
it
was
interesting
to
try
i
didnt
particularly
like
a
lot
of
the
flavors
going
on
it
was
a
little
bit
too
spicey
and
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
pepper
or
leafy
mint
flavors
going
on
i
would
maybe
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
like
interesting
beers
otherwise
i
probably
wouldnt
this
beer
is
incredibly
good
my
first
shorts
and
now
i
have
to
drink
everything
they
brew
the
flavors
are
so
powerful
and
bold
and
yet
the
beer
is
unbelievably
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
lingering
spice
is
shorts
way
of
saying
dont
you
ever
forget
what
we
are
all
about
outstanding
overall
impression
a
lovely
spiced
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
spiced
beer
but
this
is
light
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
spice
that
provide
lovely
accents
while
not
killing
your
palate
a
winner
from
shorts
excellent
beer
all
around
reminds
me
of
a
saison
but
with
more
pepperiness
will
be
requesting
my
local
store
to
stock
some
o
i
need
more
of
this
asap
damn
massive
pepper
nose
and
massive
orange
taste
the
brain
plays
tricks
on
you
and
mixes
both
aspects
of
the
beer
beautifully
this
has
to
be
my
biggest
surprise
of
2012
so
far
im
seriously
loving
this
beer
i
thought
that
this
was
an
incredibly
refreshing
brew
the
light
body
seems
like
it
would
make
it
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
bottles
but
i
could
see
the
spice
from
the
peppercorn
making
it
a
little
hard
to
session
perfect
for
a
hot
sumer
day
this
one
seems
to
be
fashioned
haphazardly
not
terrible
but
im
alright
leaving
it
at
one
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
im
not
really
a
fan
of
american
style
wheat
beers
not
even
in
these
summer
months
do
i
find
them
all
that
refreshing
that
said
the
spicy
additions
with
this
beer
really
round
out
what
can
already
be
considered
an
interesting
and
refreshing
style
also
the
resulting
burps
are
phenomenal
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
love
the
pepper
but
it
might
be
just
too
much
if
you
were
looking
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
again
its
what
makes
this
different
than
the
normal
wit
plus
its
memorable
worth
a
shot
if
you
have
a
chanc
to
try
it
would
not
seek
out
this
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
in
the
future
i
would
imagine
the
only
likelihood
of
me
drinking
again
would
be
on
a
hot
summers
day
as
i
guess
it
has
refreshment
potential
in
such
conditions
but
someone
would
have
to

and
i
was

flavors
are
just

as
the

beer
if
not
better
since
its
not
as
yeasty
good
beer
overall
while
i
didnt
find
this
super
complex
or
anything
i
did
really
appreciate
the
super
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feel
here
from
that
combination
of
wheat
fruit
and
complimentary
spices
id
go
for
another
bottle
of
this
d
easy
to
drink
but
dont
think
i
would
want
a
lot
of
this
just
because
its
not
my
style
and
like
i
said
before
i
thought
there
would
be
more
spices
glad
i
got
to
try
but
wouldnt
buy
a
whole
six
pack
of
this
would
just
put
a
bottle
in
a
mixed
six
pack
or
something
like
that
sorry
babe
all
in
all
its
a
very
interested
and
unique
take
on
a
wheat
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
can
definitely
see
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
with
a
caprese
salad
on
a
hot
summer
day
were
having
a
freak
warm
day
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
opened
this
up
12oz
bottle
to
nbb
globe
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
good
retention
some
lacing
interesting
blend
of
spices
on
the
nose
coriander
lemons
citrus
and
a
lot
of
pepper
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
good
amount
of
lemon
on
the
front
end
as
the
beer
develops
the
spices
come
through
and
dominate
especially
the
pepper
flavor
a
mix
of
citrus
clove
all
spice
flavors
along
with
a
mild
bitterness
a
mild
malt
bill
of
what
seems
to
be
wheat
and
toasted
barley
provide
a
decent
background
spices
linger
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
bit
too
much
pepper
for
my
liking
as
i
feel
it
dominates
the
flavor
and
aroma
if
that
were
toned
down
this
could
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
weird
brew
pours
a
lovely
golden
color
with
a
moderate
haze
to
it
and
a
quickly
fading
white
head
bits
of
lace
on
te
glass
smells
a
little
sour
almost
like
a
brett
beer
but
notes
of
herbs
and
citrus
override
the
sour
middle
malt
undertones
tastes
like
excellent
cannabis
tangy
and
zesty
tangerine
notes
still
some
sour
in
the
finish
a
very
very
light
peppery
flavor
too
really
nice
in
the
finish
this
one
is
growing
on
me
mouthfeel
really
transitory
first
sour
then
orange
grove
then
steak
au
poivre
then
belgianish
yeast
really
nice
not
delicate
but
less
than
sturdy
good
carbonation
i
like
this
one
a
lot
much
better
than
the
other
shorts
offerings
ive
tasted
nightcap
supreme
d
very
drinkable
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
they
seem
to
work
together
very
nicely
i
like
the
tartness
of
the
lemon
flavor
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
it
tasted
more
like
something
i
should
clean
my
house
with
instead
of
beer
pours
a
super
clear
golden
hue
with
very
little
head
nice
spicy
aroma
that
fills
the
nose
really
spicy
and
wheaty
smell
very
interesting
in
the
taste
department
a
little
overly
peppery
id
say
it
kind
of
takes
over
the
whole
beer
a
fair
bit
of
sweetness
and
citrus
but
only
mildly
noticeable
with
the
pepper
very
thin
and
disappears
pretty
fast
very
interesting
but
overall
not
the
best
mo
dry
and
smooth
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
wheat
spice
beer
but
i
wasnt
a
very
big
fan
o
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
to
back
up
the
spices
but
this
is
a
very
nice
summer
beer
drank
in
the
middle
of
winter
o
as
the
name
implies
this
is
a
spicy
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
the
different
ingredients
become
apparent
o
drinkability
was
better
than
i
expected
and
im
wanting
another
oddly
enough
i
can
see
me
craving
this
in
winter
or
summer
mild
heat
lingers
and
grows
after
each
drink
as
advertised
a
tasty
wheat
citrus
peppercorn
brew
4
strong
homebrew
flavors
of
yeast
and
malted
grain
strangely
dry
almost
astringent
strong
coriander
and
lemon
zest
flavors
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
brief
the
body
is
what
one
would
expect
im
a
big
fan
of
shorts
brewing
company
nicie
spicie
is
far
from
their
best
beer
but
it
isnt
bad
at
all
if
it
has
any
faults
its
a
bit
too
spicy
and
herbal
this
is
definitely
a
case
where
less
would
be
more
its
still
a
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
kinda
meh
spices
are
not
really
up
my
alley
not
quite
a
beer
im
for
or
drinking
usually
im
all
for
experiment
but
this
isnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
semi
sweet
yeasty
lots
of
spices
and
citrus
the
spices
make
it
feel
like
a
10
beer
despite
its
actually
half
that
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
light
good
carbonation
wonderful
spicing
that
makes
me
sad
i
dont
get
this
year
around
for
pairing
m
the
pepper
is
strong
freshly
ground
rather
than
the
cayenne
blast
of
say
pepper
spite
because
the
peppercorns
take
a
break
disappearing
briefly
midsip
they
never
get
too
strong
the
guys
over
at
shorts
really
are
a
special
bunch
of
creative
minds
o
just
too
much
cleaning
solution
o
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
its
not
some
amazing
ris
or
anything
but
it
is
very
unique
and
i
like
all
aspects
of
it
o
what
a
nicie
surprise
tried
at
gabf
and
randomly
found
locally
in
a
6pack
perfect
brew
for
a
hot
spicie
day
wonderful
awesome
work
shorts
a
wildly
unusual
and
interesting
beer
to
enjoy
seek
this
one
out
if
youre
into
the
style
orange
zest
is
prominent
here
lemon
is
next
theres
a
bit
of
rind
in
there
like
they
cut
too
deep
in
the
orange
skin
and
got
the
white
part
kind
of
like
tannin
without
the
pucker
peppercorn
is
absent
too
bad
i
would
like
to
see
more
carbonation
to
lift
up
the
zests
because
they
seem
syrupy
to
me
on
the
end
i
think
that
would
have
helped
big
time
imho
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
sixer
from
mondo
vino
along
with
other
shorts
brews
golden
yellow
color
looks
just
fine
smell
is
really
heavy
spices
to
the
point
where
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
perfumelike
almost
just
obnoxious
the
flavor
is
like
drinking
potpurri
and
shampoo
just
way
too
heavy
on
the
spices
if
i
had
bought
a
sixer
of
this
i
would
have
returned
it
m
it
sounds
weird
but
it
is
like

reading
the

to

overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
to
buy
again
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
that
really
gives
me
a
lasting
impression
it
is
a
good
beer
though
and
very
balanced
and
if
offered
i
would
drink
it
again
without
hesitation
thanks
griff
o
faint
indistinct
and
not
quite
tasty
flavors
and
nose
take
away
from
this
otherwise
light
and
sessionable
beer
a
3

overall
this
wasnt
as
herbal
tasting
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
balance
of
strange
ingredients
with
the
familiar
drinkability
that
comes
with
an
ale
this
is
a
great
brew
for
spring
and
summer
on
those
clearskied
days
where
you
just
wanna
laze
about
and
enjoy
the
tiny
things
in
life
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
for
such
occasions
overall
a
sweet
floral
beer
it
wold
be
good
on
a
warm
day
easy
to
drink
overall
the
smell
was
off
putting
but
this
was
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
flavor
unusual
is
the
best
word
i
can
come
up
a
combination
of
floral
hops
with
an
acidic
quality
similar
to
a
soft
drink
there
is
also
a
grassy
flavor
and
a
lemony
tartness

tasting

into

overall
okay
i
dont
know
what
they
were
going
for
here
but
im
not
thinking
spring
beer
overall
an
simple
ale
subtle
flavor
profile
and
aroma
kind
of
easy
drinking
magic

flagships
are
almost
all
very
good
ill
never
understand
the
animosity
these

generate

pistil
3

considering
this
is
listed
as
a
herbedspiced
beer
i
would
have
to
say
this
one
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
that
equation
and
it
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
without
the
negative
tastes
that
come
with
beers
like
bud
light
if
you
want
to
ween
a
light
american
lager
drinker
on
to
better
beers
something
like
this
or
shiner
bock
would
be
good
gateway
beers
the
carbonations
a
bit
strong
but
it
adds
a
strong
crispness
that
isnt
just
bite
the
body
is
light
and
a
good
smoothness
runs
through
into
a
dry
finish
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
sediment
white
head
forms
and
recedes
to
a
collar
and
provides
little
to
no
lace
the
aroma
is
expectedly
floral
like
fresh
flowers
and
a
bit
of
underlying
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
earthy
notes
and
edible
flowers
come
to
mind
with
a
certain
earthy
flavor
and
hops
providing
a
firm
bitterness
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
earthy
in
the
finish
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
too
bad
o
yeah
this
is
totally
a
spring
or
summer
beer
probably
just
sitting
in
the
cooler
at
that
bottle
shop
this
whole
time
my
marks
may
be
a
little
high
on
this
one
or
just
reflective
of
its
potential
an
interesting
if
not
mindblowing
beer
o
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
nothing
to
run
out
of
your
way
to
get
but
if
you
have
a
chance
give
it
a
shot
for
something
just
a
bit
different
o
not
a
standout
seemed
interesting
but
really
was
not
was
not
bad
but
for
something
so
unique
on
the
label
the
beer
just
didnt
really
deliver
i
do
not
like
green
eggs
and
ham
i
do
like
them
here
i
do
like
them
there
i
do
not
like
this
beer
unfortunately
i
found
the
overall
taste
to
be
like
licking
dandelion
milk
off
a
stem
which
wasnt
thrilling
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
nothing
outstanding
here
except
this
beers
appearance
i
would
not
reach
for
it
again
i
was
very
disappointed
by
what
seemed
like
an
interesting
idea
in
this
style
a
weird
little
beer
its
not
bad
yet
i
cant
quite
figure
this
one
out
i
suppose
the
dandelions
have
something
to
do
with
this
beer
but
its
really
difficult
to
figure
out
what
they
add
to
it
drinkable
but
not
memorable
this
is
not
particularly
good
maybe
i
need
to
wait
for
summer
to
like
this
but
i
wish
i
didnt
buy
it
35
i
keep
trying
different
offerings
from
magic
hat
because
i
am
a
fan
of

and
i
most
often
find
some
real
duds
this
is
one
of
those
another
was
their
beet
colored
beer
just
terrible
i
guess
they
are
one

worth

refresher

thats
bolder

im

nothing

overall
its
a
swing
and
a
miss
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
fridge
for
a
couple
months
now
a
bit
scared
to
drink
it
unfortunately
its
about
what
i
expected
its
bitter
like
an
ipa
just
not
in
a
good
way
not
sure
how
im
going
to
get
through
five
more
to
finish
the
sixer
o
overall
pistil
was
a
unique
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
purchase
again
pours
a
slightly
orange
tinged
yellow
its
not
exactly
clear
and
has
a
fizzy
white
head
there
is
next
to
no
lacing
following
the
rapid
depletion
of
the
foam
the
aroma
is
quite
good
mostly
consisting
of
citrus
esters
as
well
as
herbs
honey
and
yeast
for
the
flavor
bready
grains
dominate
with
buttery
hazelnut
tea
leaves
and
some
subtle
hops
theres
a
very
bitter
backbone
and
sour
dry
finish
definitely
a
bit
of
a
grassy
vegetal
aftertaste
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
however
and
none
of
the
flavors
are
very
loud
average
beer
more
of
a
novelty
but
not
a
very
bold
one
at
that
5
910
there
is
a
somewhat
clear
smell
of
flower
my
grandmother
used
to
cook
dandelions
and
i
tried
to
link
the
taste
but
it
was
a
stretch
in
fact
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
flavor
at
all
other
than
a
slightly
sour
carbonation
with
a
hint
of
citrus
i
do
appreciate
the
use
of
dandelions
though
i
think
thats
pretty
neat
its
certainly
drinkable
especially
on
a
summer
day
however
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
this
pours
a
semiclear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
lemon
citrus
to
it
the
taste
is
thin
light
and
very
floralfruity
overall
its
not
the
greatest
beer
magic
hat
makes
but
at
least
this
will
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
o
mh
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
and
i
will
be
struggling
to
finish
the
6pack
o
this
beer
is
light
delicate
and
clean
i
really
could
get
a
character
of
fresh
dandelion
flowers
however
there
wasnt
much
else
in
there
which
just
left
it
a
bit
drab
after
the
first
few
sips
im
glad
to
dry
it
but
also
glad
i
dont
have
a
whole
6
pack
of
it
o
likely
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
not
drink
this
on
any
other
occasion
the
artwork
is
cool
although
i
wish
magic
hat
would
spend
as
much
time
making
their
brews
as
interesting
as
their
bottles
o
i
always
hate
to
give
a
crafty
beer
a
great
score
but
i
really
cant
understand
how
anyone
justifies
giving
this
average
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
beer
more
refreshing
than
this
and
that
is
clearly
what
the
bottle
says
theyre
going
for
it
is
so
refreshing
and
still
tastes
good
with
the
summery
notes
like
lemon
grass
even
as
it
warms
im
sorry
but
im
a
fan
oanother
boring
experiment
beer
from
magic
hat
that
isnt
worth
buying
multiples
of
a
bit
of
a
suggestion
dont
use
the
same
yeast
for
every
single
beer
it
ruins
what
could
otherwise
be
a
well
down
spring
seasonal
its
still
perfectly
drinkable
but
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
sameness
almost
to
the
point
of
a
lip
smacking
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
crisp
light
beer

really
just
another
non
offensive
beer
that
any
kind
of
beer
drinker
will
be
able
to
put
down
not
something
id
ever
buy
but
i
see
how
a
few
of
these
would
work
on
a
hot
day
so
what
is
magic
hats
pistil
i
thought
it
was
just
a
floral
ipa
but
its
certainly
not
hoppy
or
bitter
enough
it
is
quite
floral
though
clearly
reflecting
the
name
ah
the
label
reads
ale
brewed
with
dandelion
well
thats
fairly
unique
id
heard
of
dandelion
wine
as
a
kid
it
was
something
my
older
neighbors
made
at
home
but
ive
never
heard
of
it
in
a
beer
or
have
i
let
me
look
it
up
ah
yes
apparently
its
not
that
unique
but
its
still
interesting
i
also
note
that
its
just
4
5
abv
perhaps
this
is
a
spring
beer
check
the
magic
hat
website
confirms
it
ok
lets
take
a
closer
look
hazy
yellowgold
body
beneath
a
pillowy
white
head
slightly
better
than
average
retention
and
lacing
floral
nose
as
mentioned
a
little
bit
of
golden
malt
sneaks
through
as
well
nice
in
the
mouth
its
light
bodied
and
moderately
crisp
appropriate
for
what
theyre
doing
here
the
flavor
is
not
as
floral
as
the
aroma
suggests
implying
to
me
that
its
actual
dandelions
and
not
just
hops
giving
it
that
brightness
in
the
nose
i
also
get
an
occasional
light
note
of
chlorophyll
as
well
which
backs
that
up
theres
a
light
tartness
to
it
which
is
refreshing
and
which
also
seems
to
give
me
more
of
a
floral
impression
unless
im
just
succumbing
to
the
power
of
suggestion
its
not
very
bitter
maybe
in
the
20s
and
it
finishes
quite
dry
with
the
flavor
almost
vanishing
thats
ok
though
that
works
its
a
light
bodied
and
lower
alcohol
spring
beer
thats
very
refreshing
and
i
dont
really
need
it
to
linger
in
the
mouth
theres
enough
charm
to
the
floral
dandelion
aspect
of
it
that
its
interesting
and
thankfully
not
overdone
i
can
imagine
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
would
i
buy
it
again
sure
id
enjoy
a
pint
of
this
at
the
pub
as
my
first
beer
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
take
to
a
party
im
pretty
sure
women
would
like
it
would
i
recommend
it
certainly
to
try
it
may
not
be
the
only
dandelion
beer
available
does
fantome
still
brew
pissenlit
but
its
still
unique
clear
light
gold
some
white
foam
transparent
for
sure
and
not
much
lacing
light
floral
aroma
pleasing
but
not
in
a
significant
kind
of
way
just
good
taste
is
a
clean
crisp
very
light
blonde
ale
taste
small
fruitiness
simple
and
subdued
goes
down
smoothly
sounds
like
they
did
a
lot
of
tinkering
here
but
the
end
result
is
something
mellow
and
lighter
flavor
dandelion
beer
i
had
to
try
this
its
light
and
slightly
cloudy
white
head
smell
is
ok
i
cant
smell
anything
odd
or
cool
or
unusual
it
tastes
crisp
and
bitter
there
is
an
odd
bitterness
that
i
can
only
assume
is
the
dandelions
i
havnt
ever
eatin
dandelions
so
i
cant
be
sure
i
do
like
the
willingness
to
experiment
and
over
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
applaud
the
efforts
i
think
this
beer
is
ok
nothing
really
out
of
the
park
but
the
effort
to
do
something
unusual
gets
a
lot
of
points
overall
i
thought
this
was
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
wasnt
full
of
dead
on
dandelion
flavors
but
the
earthy
floral
and
lemongrass
aspects
reminded
me
of
them
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
refreshing
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
nicely
this
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer
and
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
while
enjoying
a
warm
day
in
late
spring
the
refreshing
flavors
would
really
work
nicely
during
the
warmer
months
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
they
were
both
good
and
i
like
the
complexity
in
the
aroma
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
it
just
seemed
unnecessary
and
out
of
place
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
again
when
it
starts
to
get
warmer
outside
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
while
playing
some
disc
golf
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
floral
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
the
dandelions
worked
out
better
than
i
thought
they
would
and
while
they
didnt
provide
any
exact
dandelion
flavors
it
did
impart
some
flavors
that
reminded
me
of
smelling
the
dandelions
bloom
in
the
spring
time
magic
hat
seems
to
be
stepping
their
game
up
heart
of
darkness
and
this
beer
have
both
been
better
than
i
expected
and
they
give
me
hope
that
one
day
i
will
find
a
magic
hat
beer
that
i
really
like
good
work
guys
i
would
have
never
thought
to
brew
a
beer
with
dandelions
and
while
this
wasnt
a
smash
hit
it
sure
wasnt
a
failure
by
any
means
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
takes
some
out
of
the
box
thinking
and
creativity
to
come
up
with
a
beer
like
this
and
i
applaud
that
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
refreshing
as
many
other
beers
this
light
i
dig
what
they
tried
to
do
with
the
dandelion
but
i
think
the
execution
is
a
bit
off
o
while
this
beer
has
muted
aromas
and
flavors
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
of
these
again
on
a
summer
day
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
although
i
wont
reach
for
it
again
interesting
flavors
and
an
ambitious
attempt
at
incorporating
dandelions
but
beyond
the
dandelion
flavor
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
depth
or
scintillating
aroma
my
grandpa
used
to
make
dandelion
wine
as
ive
been
told
so
i
can
only
wonder
if
his
brews
shared
any
characteristics
with
this
one
35
o
if
i
was
outside
all
day
in
8090
degree
weather
id
love
one
of
these
i
dont
really
care
for
magic
hat
by
any
means
but
for
the
refreshing
quality
it
has
its
kinda
nice
the
alcohol
was
so
low
in
this
that
it
did
indeed
almost
feel
like
a
soda
i
could
have
had
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
only
if
there
was
some
food
to
help
this
go
down
while
this
wasnt
undrinkable
i
would
have
only
have
one
in
a
sitting
since
everything
didnt
mesh
that
well
together
maybe
on
a
nicer
day
id
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
for
now
its
only
a
try
once
just
to
see
whats
out
there
and
how
much
my
tastes
have
indeed
changed
over
the
years
rjt
overall
to
me
it
seems
like
a
runofthemill
blonde
ale
with
a
slightly
floral
well
like
dandelion
touch
part
of
the
spring
variety
pack
though
described
as
summerlike
inoffensive
and
refreshing
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
again
pretty
insubstantial
beer
not
recommended
for
any
use
overall
its
a
nice
summery
type
beer
which
ironically
im
drinking
in
the
dead
of
february
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
great
for
saturday
yard
work
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
not
much
retention
but
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
with
some
spice
body
is
thin
and
fizzy
taste
is
of
bitter
fruit
up
front
with
a
rather
sour
finish
some
hints
of
spice
for
methis
was
barley
drinkable
not
sure
where
the
word
dandelion
comes
from
in
this
beer
but
whatever
i
remember
enjoying
fatomes
pissenlit
so
i
have
high
hopes
for
another
dandelion
beer
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
honey
very
light
white
bread
and
a
touch
of
sweet
flowers
everything
is
vague
and
sweetish
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
severelyfunky
lemon
peel
light
grass
and
moss
greens
it
literally
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
sad
beer
one
that
just
plain
doesnt
taste
very
good
i
guess
dandelions
are
fickle
little
weeds
taste
is
tough
to
pin
down
individual
flavors
some
sort
of
unidentifiable
fruitiness
and
a
pithy
floral
bitterness
the
malts
are
very
light
i
think
maybe
more
of
an
amberale
type
background
might
have
worked
better
with
this
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
the
body
has
a
nice
creamy
aspect
to
it
it
makes
for
a
moderately
fun
experiment
but
i
sure
wouldnt
want
a
whole
sixer
of
it
magic
hat
might
want
to
consider
going
to
the
3
99
bomber
route
they
always
seem
to
brew
odd
beers
that
are
fun
to
try
once
but
are
really
never
all
that
great
magic
hat
should
lay
off
the
gimmicks
and
stick
to
making
solid
beers
overall
its
a
bit
different
and
while
interesting
one
was
enough
for
me
thanks
overall
id
rather
have
a
macro
if
i
was
after
a
bland
uninteresting
beer
this
one
just
lacks
flavor
and
not
much
really
is
going
on
with
it
to
make
it
a
worthwhile
beer
to
seek
out
its
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
it
poured
this
herbed
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
goldenyellow
color
produced
an
average
white
head
average
retention
and
left
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
lemon
citrus
cooked
veggies
and
coriander
medium
in
body
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
white
pepper
lemon
and
grassy
bittering
hops
cant
say
that
i
can
detect
the
danelions
but
then
again
i
usually
pull
them
out
of
my
yard
cant
say
ive
ever
consumed
one
maybe
this
spring
overall
decent
session
beer
but
it
sounds
more
interesting
then
it
really
is
this
danelion
ale
had
me
swinging
my
hips
prancing
around
the
kitchen
dipped
in
gold
a
la
joe
pesci
if
you
want
to
have
this
much
fun
try
this
ale
you
wont
be
disappointed
wwstcwbd
i
had
to
try
this
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
white
head
head
retention
is
moderate
but
the
lacing
is
lacking
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
floral
and
it
smells
a
little
nectar
like
the
taste
is
surprisingly
light
grassy
with
a
bit
of
malt
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
a
lingering
taste
of
salad
greens
definately
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
has
a
relitivley
light
mouthfeel
and
it
is
vigorously
carbonated
unique
but
not
great
tastepale
malt
lemongrass
lightbodied
and
refreshing
but
lacking
any
real
substance
like
a
dandelion
puff
in
the
wind
overall
on
first
try
i
wasnt
sure
i
would
like
this
beer
but
after
a
couple
more
sips
it
grew
on
me
and
i
found
myself
wanting
to
finish
the
beer
i
think
its
the
hint
of
the
grassyvegetable
flavor
that
threw
me
off
with
that
little
bit
of
additional
sour
taste
but
it
would
probably
be
a
really
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
on
the
patio
on
a
nice
day
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
some
malts
and
grains
taste
is
crisp
and
light
malts
some
floral
notes
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
isa
decent
beer
i
would
probably
enjoy
it
more
in
the
summertime
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
small
head
smells
like
a
bag
of
frozen
mixes
vegetables
slightly
floral
very
earth
tastes
like
it
smells
vegetables
grassy
pretty
gross
overall
id
say
try
this
12o
bottle
with
a
few
friends
its
absolutely
a
novelty
beer
and
ill
be
shocked
if
i
ever
see
anyone
buy
a
sixpack
i
like
the
idea
dont
like
the
beer
feels
a
bit
tannic
similar
to
iced
tea
its
very
light
with
medium
tingle
great
beer
it
really
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
somewhat
bitter
flavor
but
it
did
not
have
that
at
all
to
my
taste
and
im
very
against
bitterhoppy
beers
not
a
fan
of
anything
ipa
it
was
my
favorite
out
of
its
variety
pack
aside
from
the
classic
9
saw
this
on
a
whim
and
hadnt
tried
it
before
didnt
expect
the
tart
flavor
its
drinkable
not
spectacular
too
many
adjuncts
and
fairly
simple
but
decent
for
magic
hat
overall
something
worth
a
try
but
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
might
be
better
for
someone
fearful
of
flavor
a
hazy
golden
ale
with
a
large
soapy
head
and
some
chunks
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
healthy
dose
of
yeasty
bread
taste
is
malty
with
a
grassy
character
and
leafy
bitterness
in
the
finish
dry
short
finish
leaves
a
toasted
biscuit
and
mild
hop
calling
card
feel
is
crisp
and
light
with
good
carbonation
a
decent
overall
summer
beer
and
an
even
bette
lawn
mower
brew
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
o
this
is
not
good
very
bland
and
uninspiring
in
nearly
every
way
overall
somewhat
dissapointing
i
expected
something
much
different
being
brewed
with
dandelions
this
beer
gives
off
a
nice
floral
note
thats
not
to
hoppy
a
second
note
of
lemon
citrus
is
found
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
light
lager
but
finishes
a
little
earthy
beer
displays
a
weaker
bitterness
that
coats
the
tongue
the
finish
is
clean
with
only
a
mild
effect
to
the
palette
o
ok
not
bad
would
i
have
this
again
hmmm
probably
only
on
tap
o
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
i
was
impressed
with
the
look
and
aroma
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
just
dominated
by
a
floral
astringency
i
think
magic
hat
went
a
little
overboard
on
the
dandelions
regardless
it
was
nice
to
try
and
while
it
really
wasnt
bad
and
it
was
decently
drinkable
i
probably
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
overall
interesting
beer
brewed
with
dandelions
was
a
unique
experience
not
something
i
could
do
often
but
was
worth
trying
this
is
a
unique
beer
to
me
i
was
surprised
that
the
dandelion
notes
came
through
the
herbal
spicy
hop
characters
dominate
however
this
is
light
and
a
bit
bitter
ultimately
this
is
easily
drinkable
but
ill
pass
in
the
end
its
not
a
flavor
i
would
crave
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
fruity
palewheat
malt
scent
along
with
hints
of
dandelion
and
other
floral
notes
its
dry
with
a
touch
of
earthiness
the
taste
is
average
again
its
light
and
refreshing
with
a
solid
fruityfloral
character
it
goes
down
really
smooth
with
a
bone
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
rather
quaffable
beer
with
a
refreshingly
interesting
flavor
and
outstanding
aroma
i
like
the
carbonation
level
but
the
body
is
a
little
too
thin
and
the
hops
are
buried
under
everything
else
not
a
bad
summer
beer
but
nothing
more
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
or
would
buy
a
bottle
of
it
i
didnt
hate
it
but
theres
so
much
more
to
enjoy
i
cant
see
going
back
o
overall
this
beer
is
a
sweet
comfort
without
tang
and
is
enjoyable
throughout
any
sunny
day
not
available
unless
you
get
the
mixed
pack
but
worth
the
buy
whether
you
are
a
mh
fan
or
not
this
mixed
pack
has
something
for
everyone
the
label
alone
should
catch
your
intrigue
most
herbspice
beers
are
a
gamble
and
this
time
i
lost
as
i
didnt
care
for
the
flavor
or
aroma
of
this
experimental
beer
kudos
to
magic
hat
for
trying
but
i
just
didnt
dig
it
the
appearance
is
very
nice
golden
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
minute
the
smell
has
some
malt
and
some
floral
notes
to
it
the
taste
is
different
it
has
a
peppery
taste
with
some
like
floral
notes
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
not
one
of
my
favorits
by
magic
hat
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
grassy
soapy
and
citrusy
hops
and
it
has
a
yeasty
bread
element
the
appearance
is
hazy
gold
with
a
large
head
the
taste
is
bitter
and
pretty
much
just
hops
the
palate
is
average
overall
its
not
what
i
expected
its
a
bitter
ipa
type
of
beer
but
its
not
bad
o
i
guess
if
you
like
light
and
mildly
herby
flavored
beer
this
one
is
for
you
the
dandelion
doesnt
impart
much
taste
which
leaves
the
house
yeast
which
people
tend
to
either
love
or
hate
sort
of
middle
ground
for
me
it
does
have
a
nice
summery
vibe
going
on
though
which
is
what
mh
was
probably
going
for
with
this
one
i
must
admit
after
drinking
some
recent
beers
from
magic
hat
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
this
surprisingly
this
is
actually
pretty
interesting
i
dont
really
know
what
dandelion
tastes
like
but
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
flavor
this
is
a
unique
beer
because
i
cant
say
i
have
had
any
type
of
beer
with
dandelion
in
it
before
the
smell
is
totally
different
than
the
taste
until
midway
through
and
it
starts
with
a
slight
malt
taste
but
gets
very
floral
almost
grassy
and
slightly
lemony
in
the
next
taste
the
yeast
adds
a
light
creaminess
to
the
flavor
with
subtle
toasted
tinges
from
the
malt
which
has
a
mild
sweet
element
but
overall
the
flavors
are
ok
just
seem
to
cohabitate
in
general
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
like
wheat
and
spice
but
not
a
really
complex
beer
more
for
summer
relaxation
and
i
felt
it
was
decent
i
like
it
its
clever
definitely
an
american
pale
ale
hoppier
than
youd
think
from
a
flower
beer
but
its
nice
smells
like
the
spirit
of
dandellion
very
polleny
like
biting
the
yellow
head
off
one
of
them
then
eating
the
greens
and
roasting
the
root
its
hard
to
place
really
in
any
meaningful
stylistic
sense
but
it
sure
is
drinkable
flavor
is
very
pollen
based
in
a
good
way
like
coconut
water
in
the
sense
than
its
drinkable
and
satisfying
but
you
always
want
more
im
impressed
with
this
feel
is
intersting
plenty
of
body
for
a
summer
beer
but
medium
carbonation
that
lets
you
taste
the
whole
thing
overall
a
beer
i
will
drink
a
million
of
this
summer
and
a
one
of
a
kind
creation
i
like
the
bold
hops
in
this
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
with
a
light
body
and
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
the
light
body
allows
this
beer
to
hold
up
well
on
a
hot
day
from
the
summer
mixed
twelve
pack
bought
at
trader
joes
in
washington
dc
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
definitely
fit
in
well
with
the
summer
pack
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
picture
people
drinking
during
the
summer
like
most
magic
hat
brews
this
had
an
interesting
concept
and
taste
but
nothing
about
it
really
stood
out
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
probably
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
i
like
how
they
are
pretty
experimental
though
not
many
beers
that
i
know
of
are
brewed
with
dandelions
im
not
sure
what
dandelions
taste
like
but
you
can
definitely
sense
a
lot
of
floralherbal
presence
in
this
beer
recommended
trying
it
in
a
12pack
o
not
a
bad
beer
worth
trying
not
the
best
from
the
mixed
12
pack
this
poured
out
as
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
floating
particles
in
it
the
head
was
foamy
and
white
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
floral
and
sweet
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
big
sweetness
in
the
beginning
that
fades
into
a
gentle
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
its
got
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
lot
better
than
i
pictured
it
being
i
would
probably
drink
this
one
again
some
day
a
nice
light
apaipa
good
hop
flavor
not
strong
but
tastey
the
dandelions
dont
do
much
good
summer
brew
pours
a
pale
slightly
murky
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
bright
white
head
smells
of
grassy
hops
some
herbal
and
flowery
aromas
and
a
hint
of
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
grassy
hop
tones
some
grain
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
but
still
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
tried
from
magic
hat
quite
sessionable
far
drier
than
the
smell
indicates
theres
still
some
fruitiness
as
if
dried
apricots
were
added
to
the
bright
tank
the
finish
features
mild
bitterness
neutral
body
and
carbonation
incidentally
dandelions
are
highly
underrated
i
kick
the
little
bastards
whenever
i
see
them
because
a
its
fun
making
them
explode
b
it
irritates
other
people
and
c
it
makes
more
dandelions
causing
a
and
b
to
repeat
yeasty
malt
mouth
up
front
with
bitter
dandelion
coming
in
the
middle
finishes
with
grainy
oat
notes
has
real
nice
balance
to
it
a
sharp
almost
citrus
bight
balanced
by
a
nice
malty
punch
this
is
by
know
means
great
but
it
is
surprisingly
good
goes
down
real
well
after
mowing
the
grass
poured
a
light
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
bit
of
noticeable
sediment
under
a
cap
of
bright
foamy
white
head
minimal
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
meadow
flowers
this
is
brewed
with
dandelion
after
all
lightly
hopped
light
taste
not
bursting
with
flavor
but
this
isnt
that
kind
of
beer
grassy
notes
flowery
light
perfume
nothing
i
would
call
spicy
per
se
just
more
floral
than
anything
this
beer
had
to
have
been
very
fresh
crisp
but
subdued
hops
and
light
biscuity
malts
normally
i
wouldnt
drink
something
this
light
but
man
did
it
go
down
smooth
and
easy
i
could
theoretically
sit
outside
all
day
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
drink
a
case
of
this
overall
a
fantastic
summer
brew
that
was
light
tasty
and
quite
satisfying
it
is
great
to
taste
a
lager
that
has
some
flavor
and
a
great
drinkability
decent
but
not
much
to
it
some
vague
flavors
from
the
danelions
perhaps
too
subtle
imo
a
basic
cloudy
unidentified
brew
at
best
sorry
this
doesnt
work
for
me
tastes
slightly
bitter
like
tea
along
with
some
cooked
greens
somewhat
crisp
and
dry
in
the
aftertaste
a
light
herbal
sweetness
balances
the
bitterness
again
somewhat
green
and
floral
somewhat
interesting
but
not
well
defined
tastes
like
tea
mostly
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
tons
of
floaties
kind
of
interesting
to
be
honest
nice
wheaty
smell
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
definitely
get
a
nice
warm
weather
vibe
great
mouthfeel
with
some
snappy
hops
a
bit
of
sourness
and
a
nice
clean
finish
surprisingly
well
balanced
and
pretty
tasty
for
a
seasonal
a
pretty
good
new
addition
from
magic
hat
recommended
i
had
this
out
of
the
summer
mixer
and
surprisingly
it
was
the
standout
its
not
amazing
but
its
a
well
put
together
beer
i
think
thats
the
last
time
i
get
a
4
beer
mixed
pack
though
from
magic
hat
they
should
really
think
about
a
6
beer
mix
pack
whats
so
wrong
with
variety
4
is
not
a
variety
especially
when
you
force
3
bottles
of
9
down
my
throat
i
dont
mind
this
spring
seasonal
im
giving
magic
hat
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
here
when
i
say
that
this
is
one
of
their
more
interesting
beers
tasty
in
its
own
way
you
just
have
to
be
down
for
anything
when
it
comes
to
herb
beers
i
was
expecting
one
thing
and
got
something
close
to
what
i
envisioned
that
little
bit
outofleftfield
character
makes
it
all
the
more
worthwhile

first
off
its
pretty
damn
good
for
something
brewed
with
lawn
weeds
who
would
have
thought
of
dandelions
start
off
with
a
nice
grassy
lemon
aroma
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
cloudy
hazy
body
similar
to
heffweisen
has
a
full
thick
head
that
lasts
quite
well
and
laces
the
glass
right
down
to
the
bottom
taste
is
citrusy
sweet
with
a
crisp
slightly
acid
finish
imparts
a
pleasing
aftertaste
not
for
the
hop
lover
overall
damn
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
if
you
were
to
tell
me
its
a
wheat
beer
i
would
notice
the
dandelions
very
strange
and
worth
trying
once
this
is
a
tough
one
to
review
its
a
good
beer
thats
for
sure
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
brews
however
its
just
a
little
bit
odd
it
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
dont
stick
around
for
too
long
the
aroma
is
nice
its
got
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
pilsner
feel
to
it
with
herbal
and
citrus
hops
and
grass
the
taste
is
very
interesting
with
the
citrus
hops
and
some
tealike
flavors
coming
through
first
then
follows
some
smooth
malts
a
very
light
sour
note
and
more
citrus
flavors
ending
with
a
clean
grassy
note
theres
a
lot
going
on
for
the
4
5
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
superb
and
interesting
summer
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
go
with
its
drinkability
o
i
liked
the
spicing
mix
but
more
of
a
malty
backbone
would
brought
more
of
a
gingerbread
flavor
damn
good
ginger
bread
beer
alittle
sweet
but
still
good
mix
a
little
brown
sugar
in
it
too
and
its
amazing
serving
type
bottle
pass
this
one
by
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
head
maybe
i
missed
the
ginger
i
wonder
if
this
would
go
well
with
certain
types
of
cuisine
i
cant
say
as
im
not
much
of
a
foodie
not
bad
overall
totally
sessionable
kind
of
like
a
peppery
lemon
shandy
good
with
sushi
despite
not
really
tasting
like
ginger
this
was
nice
and
light
why
you
make
me
review
eh
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
ok
and
i
thought
it
was
very
average
for
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
expected
but
when
it
came
down
to
it
they
were
almost
all
lighter
than
i
wanted
and
in
the
end
i
just
wanted
more
out
of
the
flavor
of
this
beer
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
halfway
through
it
and
i
already
bored
of
it
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
nice
and
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
just
too
bland
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
just
thought
it
was
pretty
boring
and
it
didnt
really
have
anything
that
it
made
it
stick
out
or
be
memorable
so
far
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
harpoon
beers
and
i
would
say
its
average
at
best
for
the
style
this
beer
needs
some
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
much
just
a
sweet
ginger
beer
rather
than
a
gingerbread
tastestraightahead
gingerbread
cookie
a
bit
lightbodied
but
nice
not
overdone
sure
this
had
all
of
the
traits
of
a
session
beer
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
there
may
have
been
some
wheat
in
this
which
would
explain
the
lack
of
sharpness
in
this
beer
if
so
it
only
served
to
confuse
me
as
this
didnt
seem
like
something
that
was
herbed
or
spiced
worth
a
go
once
because
of
the
quasiuniqueness
of
it
but
this
almost
seemed
like
a
ginger
ale
with
a
bit
more
body
and
no
stickiness
from
high
fructose
corn
syrup
a
light
beer
compared
to
other
gingerbread
beers
ive
had
lable
says
gingerbread
inspired
you
definitely
get
the
ginger
in
the
nose
and
flavor
it
makes
me
think
ginger
ale
as
in
the
soft
drink
rather
than
gingerbread
though
the
good
news
is
its
a
lot
less
carbonated
and
much
more
smooth
in
mouth
feel
than
the
soft
drink
not
bad

good
i
think
i
drank
it
too
cold
i
love
the
muddy
almost
blood
orange
look
of
it
the
smell
is
a
typical
pumpkin
ale
with
spice
and
nutmeg
so
i
am
guessing
the
odor
is
true
i
then
noticed
the
unfiltered
orange
color
which
is
nice
the
beer
is
very
hazy
and
bright
the
taste
then
comes
together
and
makes
me
understand
the
beer
the
taste
is
very
light
and
refreshing
as
does
a
slight

the
